1
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,200
Where am I?

2
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,080
Oh, there I am.

3
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,040
Oh, shit.

4
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,220
I'm so loud.

5
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:46,900
I'm so sorry.

6
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,780
I'm so sorry.

7
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,740
Whoa, I'm so sorry.

8
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,120
Let me... I'm sorry.

9
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,280
I'm sorry, guys.

10
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,520
I'm at 98.

11
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,100
Whoa, okay.

12
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:54,860
That should be better.

13
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,020
Oh, my God.

14
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,600
I'm sorry.

15
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,480
I didn't realize how loud I was.

16
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,820
I was like at 98.

17
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,560
I was like, why the fuck am I at 98?

18
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,720
Anyway, guys.

19
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,680
Hello, everybody.

20
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,920
I am currently unpacking the Marvel Rivals right now.

21
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,240
I am at 12.13 gigabytes out of 47.

22
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,920
Apparently, when you preload the game...

23
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,940
When you preload the game, it like...

24
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,140
It doesn't guarantee... It's not like fully downloaded.

25
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,520
You gotta unpack it at the exact time.

26
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,040
So, we're at currently... We're 15 gigabytes down.

27
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,760
AstroGuy, thank you for the super chat.

28
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,020
Thank you.

29
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,440
Thank you.

30
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,360
I find it suspicious that Doki is right on time for stream when it's a release of Overwatch.

31
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,800
I mean Marvel Rivals.

32
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,360
Thank you for the super chat.

33
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:44,720
Thank you.

34
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,500
Thank you.

35
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,520
I mean...

36
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,920
I need a new addiction, guys.

37
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,300
I can't keep relapsing into Overwatch.

38
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,880
I need something new.

39
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,180
Also, I realized I forgot to write that down.

40
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,580
I'm... Okay.

41
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,020
I uploaded a short that was like, I'm a mess.

42
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,320
And someone in the chat... I saw someone in the comments that was like, Doki, why are you not a mess?

43
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,060
Anyway, I'm a little bit of a mess right now.

44
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,380
Because there are like multiple things I forgot to do regarding this particular stream.

45
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,800
So, at the end of the stream, there's gonna be a special announcement.

46
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,880
I won't spoil what it is.

47
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,840
Member goons might know what it is.

48
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,220
Because I did give a little hint as to what the announcement is.

49
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,180
So, it's gonna be announced at the end of the stream.

50
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,520
So, you guys gotta stick it to the end, basically.

51
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,920
And it's a very cool announcement.

52
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,720
It's a very happy announcement, too.

53
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:47,980
And then...

54
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,960
What else do I have to say?

55
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:51,920
That's it.

56
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,320
Oh, yeah.

57
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,240
So, there's an announcement at the end of the stream.

58
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,420
I forgot to say... I forgot to be more public about it.

59
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,780
I literally changed the title of the stream.

60
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,180
I think like four hours before I was supposed to start.

61
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,240
And I ended up forgetting to...

62
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,380
I forgot to tweet that out.

63
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,800
So, three hours before the stream was supposed to start, I was like, By the way, there's gonna be an announcement.

64
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,600
And some people were like...

65
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,280
So, there's no really heads up for people.

66
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,160
I also posted the wrong link to the waiting room.

67
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,100
Because what I do for waiting rooms, I just copy and paste.

68
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,460
And then just like... I just go copy and paste.

69
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,100
And then bam.

70
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,800
And then change the links and everything.

71
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,860
I forgot to change the link to the stream itself.

72
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,340
And I usually schedule my... I schedule my waiting room tweets.

73
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:48,120
Because I try to make sure it tweets out seven hours before the stream is supposed to start.

74
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,740
So, then like... I would be sleeping when that happens.

75
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,960
So, usually I'm not awake when the waiting room tweets go up.

76
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,940
You know when I'm awake when it tells like...

77
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:04,380
You know when I'm on Twitter and I'm awake when I also link the art of the thumbnail.

78
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,200
That's when you know that I was awake when I made that tweet.

79
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,340
When there's no like instant link to the artist of the thumbnail.

80
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,640
That's when you know I am definitely asleep.

81
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,720
I was not there.

82
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,260
I'm not alive at that time.

83
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,120
Golden, thank you for the super chat.

84
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,040
Thank you, thank you.

85
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,960
Evening Doki, it's my friend and fellow Dragoon Melphie's birthday today.

86
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,840
If you can tease her a little and say happy birthday.

87
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,920
I'm sure she'll instantly pass out later when she sees the VOD.

88
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,400
Happy birthday Mel.

89
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,480
Alright, happy birthday to you.

90
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,180
Happy birthday to you.

91
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,860
Happy birthday dear Mel.

92
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,760
Happy birthday to you.

93
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,020
Yeah, happy birthday!

94
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,640
Okay, life update.

95
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,520
I talked about this before in the member stream.

96
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,920
So, I'll say here for those who are not membered.

97
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,520
So, we have a new neighbor.

98
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,640
This is basically the same thing I told in the member stream yesterday.

99
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,620
I don't know if you guys want to hear the story again.

100
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,940
So, we have a new neighbor.

101
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,060
They have a dog.

102
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,960
And I don't know what this dog looks like.

103
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:13,420
But, you can tell what type of dog breed they are based on their barks.

104
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,940
So, like, this particular dog breed.

105
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:22,440
I am 99% sure it's one of those stupid...

106
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,580
I'm sorry, I've yelled one of them.

107
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,860
It's one of those...

108
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,040
Like, you know what I'm talking about.

109
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,220
They have a very distinct bark.

110
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:39,820
So, the... I'm sorry if my neighbor hears this.

111
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:46,220
But, like, basically, there's this new neighbor who has a toy poodle.

112
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,240
I've never seen this dog before.

113
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,980
But, I have absolutely heard that dog barking.

114
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,680
And the worst part about it is that...

115
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,440
Hey, my dog is half toy.

116
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:12,040
So, the worst part about it is that this toy poodle would bark randomly almost every day.

117
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,640
And because they would bark randomly almost every day, they'd be like...

118
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:23,240
I have to deal with Doki Amber Doge barking back at them.

119
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,120
Because he's like, who the fuck is this bitch?

120
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:37,520
So, it ended up causing this infinite loop of barking at each other through a door.

121
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,240
Because, like, I don't know, through two doors.

122
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:47,200
Because, like, then the other dog, the toy poodle is like, who's this other guy barking at me?

123
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,960
And they just go like...

124
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,400
It's just a loop.

125
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,460
It's a fucking loop.

126
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,980
They don't stop.

127
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,440
And the only way I could stop the barking...

128
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,080
Because this happens, like, almost every day now.

129
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:06,140
Because, like, you know, she starts and then my dog hears her.

130
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,500
And then he starts going at it.

131
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,360
And then she hears him.

132
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,820
So, she continues and it's an infinite loop.

133
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,200
It's just negative feedback.

134
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:21,720
So, I learned that the only way to stop this from happening is that...

135
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:29,220
I had to dig through my boxes and I found his training collar.

136
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,580
And I don't put it on him.

137
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:37,120
But when he sees me hold that training collar, he fucking walks away.

138
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,750
He's just like, oh shit.

139
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,890
And then he just walks back.

140
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,770
He's just like...

141
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:49,610
So...

142
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:51,530
So...

143
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,850
He walks back and it stops.

144
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,070
Until...

145
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,890
So, the loop stops.

146
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,110
So...

147
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,050
So, I have to do that now.

148
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:08,490
I literally have, like, his training collar, like, next to me.

149
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:12,890
In case, like, he starts walking over to the door and starts the loop again.

150
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:17,110
And the moment he starts the fucking loop, I have to, like, go outside.

151
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,470
Like, go to the door and show him the collar.

152
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,550
And he just walks back.

153
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,810
And he's like, okay, I'm gonna stop.

154
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,310
Okay, I'll stop.

155
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:23,850
I'm sorry.

156
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,310
It's literally the only way.

157
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,310
Like, cause the toy poodle doesn't stop.

158
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,410
Like, she could go on forever.

159
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:36,790
Like, I can only stop what I see right now.

160
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,070
So...

161
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:40,910
So, yes.

162
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,990
I had to, unfortunately...

163
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:47,330
I had to, unfortunately, use his PTSD against him.

164
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,250
So, like, we could all be happy.

165
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:50,970
I don't put it on him.

166
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:51,990
I just let him see it.

167
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,530
So, he could, like, just the memories flash through him.

168
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:55,810
Anyway, guys.

169
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,170
Marvel Rivals!

170
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:02,030
I am super excited to finally try out Marvel Rivals.

171
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,790
We've been in...

172
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,690
We've been in, like, uh...

173
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,450
The beta test.

174
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,510
We were in the beta test.

175
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,030
We were in the alpha test.

176
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:14,410
And finally, we get to play on launch day!

177
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,990
What I'm most excited about, um...

178
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,110
Marvel Rivals.

179
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,050
Uh, for the launch date.

180
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:24,790
Is the fact that they are launching 32 new...

181
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,670
Like, 32 characters.

182
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:30,250
Which is absolutely insane if you think about it.

183
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:33,230
Because that's a lot of new characters.

184
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,610
Um, and I think, like...

185
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,550
Um...

186
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,650
What's crazy...

187
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:39,170
Oh, 33.

188
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:39,610
Sorry.

189
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:40,570
I was one short.

190
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,210
33 characters.

191
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:46,150
Um, because, like, you know, when we first played the alpha and the beta...

192
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,210
There wasn't a lot of, like, characters unlocked.

193
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,530
But now there's 33!

194
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,510
Going straight in on launch day!

195
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,030
And they're all available, like, now.

196
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,370
So, like, it's not like...

197
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,770
Um, it's like pay to win or anything.

198
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,270
You can actually get all of them now.

199
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,470
Without having to wait for it.

200
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,930
And then my favorite thing about it is that, like, people are like...

201
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:04,790
Oh...

202
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,470
Not my favorite thing, but, like...

203
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,610
What I find the most funny...

204
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,250
Is that people were like...

205
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:12,130
Oh...

206
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,070
Okay, also this guy is funny, too.

207
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:14,390
I...

208
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,830
I gotta show you Mr. Fantastic, by the way.

209
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,110
I showed this in the members.

210
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,950
But, like, this is what Mr. Fantastic looks like.

211
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,930
Um, with his alt form.

212
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,770
And, okay, so...

213
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,190
That's honestly one of my favorite pictures.

214
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,270
And...

215
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,990
But, like, people were like...

216
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:33,610
Oh my god.

217
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,110
They're gonna steal more than just...

218
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,630
Uh, they're gonna steal...

219
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,270
Um, a lot of...

220
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,190
More than just the Overwatch...

221
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,210
Um, player base.

222
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,350
They're gonna steal the Overwatch...

223
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,290
Gooner base.

224
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,870
Okay, what the fuck...

225
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,530
Do you mean by that?

226
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,270
Well, um...

227
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,510
If you guys don't know...

228
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:02,550
If you guys did not know...

229
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,510
What, um...

230
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,390
Um, what the characters...

231
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,450
Sort of look like...

232
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,450
Uh, they have a...

233
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,690
Particular visual about them.

234
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:15,690
So...

235
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,270
Um, they...

236
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,770
Aw, man, what can I say about them?

237
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,350
They are...

238
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:24,530
Aw, man, I had the pictures, but I don't...

239
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,630
I didn't save them.

240
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,870
Okay, give me a sec.

241
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,050
Let me see if I can find it.

242
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,710
Uh, Marvel Rivals...

243
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,150
Women.

244
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,170
I wonder if I could, like...

245
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,090
Get, like, the entire...

246
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:38,850
The compilation.

247
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,090
Oh, I can't.

248
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,590
Alright, so, like...

249
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,850
Okay, I can show you Squirrel...

250
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,070
Squirrel Girl.

251
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,050
And then, you know, I can show her, like...

252
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:48,830
On the game.

253
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,430
Like, I don't even need a fucking...

254
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,370
Why am I Googling it?

255
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,650
I can literally boot up the game.

256
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:53,530
Like, give me a sec.

257
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,350
Let me boot it up.

258
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,030
I don't know why I tried to show...

259
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,650
Why did I didn't get...

260
00:14:58,650 --> 00:14:59,470
Get a picture?

261
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,850
I can literally boot up the game...

262
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,650
And show it to you guys, cause I...

263
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,630
Cause it's already done.

264
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:10,490
Um...

265
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,030
It's already... Okay, your system is using...

266
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,730
Unlocked Intel 13...

267
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,050
Or 14th Gen Desktop CPU.

268
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,650
And you're experiencing...

269
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,470
I'm not, right?

270
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:20,910
There's no way.

271
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:21,850
I don't think I am.

272
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:22,770
Okay, launch.

273
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,150
I don't remember if I am.

274
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:24,870
We'll see, right?

275
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,250
We'll see.

276
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,530
Yeah, I'm super excited.

277
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,510
The only issue I have about this...

278
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,210
Is the fact that it is...

279
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:34,390
In third person.

280
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,650
So, um...

281
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:37,870
Oh yeah, I'm on AMD now.

282
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,390
I forgot.

283
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:39,330
I'm on AMD.

284
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,630
We had an issue with Marvel Rivals...

285
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,430
Because I was on Intel.

286
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,750
It's just the fact that...

287
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,610
Um...

288
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:49,090
I'm not like a big fan of third person in general.

289
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,030
When it comes to like competitive.

290
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,950
Like, I'm okay with...

291
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,410
Third person for like...

292
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,650
A fun, just like...

293
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,030
Um...

294
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,790
Not try hard type of game and just like...

295
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,490
Head empty type thing.

296
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,730
But rank wise...

297
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,090
Rank wise, I am not like...

298
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,870
I'm not a huge fan of third person for rank.

299
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,810
Just because I feel like...

300
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,050
It's not as...

301
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,670
It doesn't feel as competitive for me.

302
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,090
I feel like first person...

303
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,070
Increases the competitiveness.

304
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,910
And increases like the more intensity...

305
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,090
Of like...

306
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,450
Shooters in general.

307
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,410
But, we'll see.

308
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,410
Cause like I was talking to like...

309
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,630
Some of my friends about it.

310
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,210
And they were saying how like...

311
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,210
Also like I'm compiling shaders.

312
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,130
And that's why I'm lagging right now.

313
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,770
And they're saying that like...

314
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,030
It might be fun for like maybe like...

315
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,110
A couple of days.

316
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,570
But it could like you know...

317
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,070
You know...

318
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,170
It's hard to be competitive if it's like...

319
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,310
If they don't give the same feeling.

320
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,610
As feeling.

321
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:51,650
So I don't know.

322
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,230
We'll see.

323
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,530
We'll see how we feel.

324
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,970
I do enjoy it.

325
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,510
Because I played the alpha test and the beta test.

326
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,110
And I really really enjoyed...

327
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,470
The alpha and the beta test.

328
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,430
But I was also fucking around a lot.

329
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:06,890
So...

330
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,770
I mean...

331
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,350
Literally I was like...

332
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,010
Clap to heal!

333
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,030
Clap everybody!

334
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:16,050
Now dance everyone!

335
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,690
Dance to heal!

336
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,590
Like I was not...

337
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,510
I was not taking it very seriously.

338
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,270
I was like keep clapping!

339
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:27,150
Woo!

340
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:33,940
Hmm...

341
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,880
So yeah we'll see.

342
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,000
We'll see how I feel.

343
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,240
I haven't seen Psylocke look that kicked up since the Capcom Arcades are going for the SFM artists.

344
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,900
Not just the gamers.

345
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,240
It's time to reboot Patreon!

346
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:47,580
Everybody!

347
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,020
It's time!

348
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:51,620
Okay...

349
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,340
Can I be like my...

350
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,740
Has anyone claimed my name yet?

351
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:57,440
Oh!

352
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,740
For once I can actually be my name.

353
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,700
That's crazy.

354
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,680
Usually I like have like the most dumb ass names.

355
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,940
Because everybody would claim it.

356
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,940
For once I can actually be me.

357
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:08,700
Like...

358
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,720
Alright so...

359
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,400
Let's check out the new...

360
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,300
Alright so...

361
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,120
Where's Psylocke?

362
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,440
Where is she?

363
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,880
Oh there she is.

364
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,700
Okay that's not Psylocke.

365
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,760
I'm talking about Squirrel Girl.

366
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,780
So yeah.

367
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:23,980
Yeah.

368
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,920
It's time to...

369
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,620
Woah.

370
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,040
It's...

371
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,340
It's time to...

372
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,180
Re-pledge to Patreon guys.

373
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,820
Possessing only a power...

374
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,600
But somehow during the rematch defeat...

375
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,000
Wait what do you... Woah.

376
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,560
Oh my god.

377
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,600
We're back to the...

378
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
The 50s with her.

379
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,080
That's cute.

380
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,180
Wait this is so cute.

381
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,140
I heard the Battle Pass...

382
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,460
Okay one of the things I actually liked...

383
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:53,680
About...

384
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,160
One of the things I actually liked...

385
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,860
About the...

386
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,460
The Marble Rivals...

387
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,080
Thing they did with cosmetics...

388
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,140
Is that if you buy the Battle Pass...

389
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,920
You're not forced to...

390
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,800
Get to the end of the Battle Pass...

391
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,900
In a specific time.

392
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,800
There's no time limit for Battle Passes.

393
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,040
So there's no FOMO.

394
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,860
So you can take your time to unlock everything if you want to.

395
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,380
So that's what I like.

396
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,060
And they said that...

397
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,000
For cosmetics right now...

398
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,740
You can play...

399
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,940
To unlock cosmetics.

400
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,880
So you don't have to actually spend money.

401
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,040
For now.

402
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,560
I don't know.

403
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,580
I don't know if they'll change though.

404
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,560
So like...

405
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,260
Who knows?

406
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,400
Things could be different.

407
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,580
But...

408
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,680
It's not a skip.

409
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,560
Look I've been through a lot when it comes to like...

410
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,940
Battle Passes and cosmetics.

411
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,680
So like hearing that is actually like...

412
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,760
It's actually...

413
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,960
Really different from how other video games do it.

414
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,000
Yeah, it's a free game.

415
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,980
Yeah, I feel like...

416
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,640
They do that just to make you like...

417
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,300
Whoa!

418
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,640
Oh my god.

419
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,920
I have to...

420
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,840
I gotta check it out now.

421
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,240
Okay, this is the one that everybody was...

422
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,280
Oh, that's the default skin?

423
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,460
Oh, so this is the newer one.

424
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,700
This is the cosmetic that you have to buy.

425
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,160
Oh...

426
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,100
I wonder if I have to change my...

427
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:13,980
Controls.

428
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,060
I actually didn't check that.

429
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,560
Um...

430
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,280
Alright, what is her abilities?

431
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,000
Using crossbow...

432
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,060
To damage enemies...

433
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,760
And reduce the cooldown of all her abilities.

434
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,520
Slash nearby enemies with katana.

435
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,040
Ooh!

436
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,280
Wait, that's sick.

437
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,700
Stash forward and slice through enemies.

438
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,180
The thing is, she's melee.

439
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,920
And I'm not like a melee person though.

440
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,400
Um...

441
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,020
Oh, I heard Black Widow is Widowmaker.

442
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,560
Is basically Widowmaker.

443
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,840
And that it's like...

444
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,220
She's like stronger than Widowmaker too.

445
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,180
As a sniper.

446
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,980
Alright, let's see.

447
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,300
What's her MVP?

448
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,420
This is basically like play of the game.

449
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,100
Okay.

450
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,480
I like how...

451
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,800
I like where she's facing.

452
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,360
Widow, strike with the enemy...

453
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,060
Electron...

454
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,200
Okay, enhanced electric...

455
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,280
Baton.

456
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,960
Attack with the...

457
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,100
Apparently this shit is really strong.

458
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,240
There's the...

459
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,240
Damaging enemies when leaving a plasma on the ground.

460
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,380
Oh shit!

461
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,080
That is so strong!

462
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,840
Stash forward and enable a powerful jump.

463
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,160
Okay, that's like high jump.

464
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,380
Unleash a spinning kick to launch up enemies.

465
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,160
Landing hit will allow her to zip to the target with a grappling hook for a second kick.

466
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,160
This is like melee Widow.

467
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,040
Oh my god, that's scary.

468
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,320
Okay, and that's the...

469
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,480
That's the Widowmaker.

470
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,480
And apparently if you have...

471
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,420
A Marvel Hanzo...

472
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,620
As in Hawkeye...

473
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,300
You get like...

474
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:54,900
Walls.

475
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,180
Widow if she can fight back.

476
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,800
Yeah, so you duo with a Hawkeye...

477
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,040
You can get like...

478
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,440
Basically walls from him.

479
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,080
Which is scary.

480
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,180
Which is...

481
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,920
The wall, yeah.

482
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,100
You get to have wall hacks and stuff.

483
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,220
Where the fuck are you?

484
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,660
I'm still looking.

485
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,760
So, I guess...

486
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,160
There's Black Widow, Cloak, and Dat Cloak.

487
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,260
Wait, that's not fair!

488
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,360
There are two people!

489
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,660
How is this fair?

490
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,400
Also, who are they?

491
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,420
That's also another question.

492
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,220
Who are they?

493
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,920
That's not fair!

494
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,860
This is like a 1v2, what do they do?

495
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,480
Oh wait, she's a support?

496
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:48,860
Oh!

497
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,400
Okay, so this is an Ana heal.

498
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,940
You gotta hit them, they heal them.

499
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,660
Perform three rapid dashes, healing allies and damaging allies along the path.

500
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,180
Wait, what?

501
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:00,880
Okay, so...

502
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,080
Do I run into them?

503
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,260
I basically heal them.

504
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:05,860
Switch to Cloak.

505
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,500
What happens if I switch to him?

506
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,320
The fuck does that do?

507
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:11,620
I'm just...

508
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,860
Cool.

509
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,800
Now she...

510
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,680
Now she has a Cloak.

511
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,540
Okay.

512
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,660
It doesn't even say!

513
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,140
The fuck does Shadow Brace does?

514
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,100
Oh, there we go!

515
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,240
Okay, alright, I was gonna be like...

516
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,260
Wait, that's so compli...

517
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,440
Okay, that's a lot for my brain.

518
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,660
I didn't realize I can actually swap to him.

519
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,000
Okay, he's a damage character, basically.

520
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,200
Perform three...

521
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,360
Okay, no, he can still heal.

522
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,700
He can still heal.

523
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,640
And then...

524
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,840
Oh my god, that's way too much thinking.

525
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,120
Okay, I hope he's not meta.

526
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,700
I...

527
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,760
Yeah, this is like a high skill cap.

528
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,120
Oh my god.

529
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:13,540
Okay, cause like you gotta be able to juggle between two different characters as you play.

530
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,820
So like...

531
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,800
The game literally just came out 25 minutes ago.

532
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,860
There's no way he's...

533
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,520
There is no way.

534
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,700
How is this a three star difficulty?

535
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,760
This is two heroes at once.

536
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,600
At once!

537
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,380
Okay.

538
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,320
So I can basically make...

539
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,940
Wait, okay, so like if we all group up together, I can make everybody invisible.

540
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,200
Create light where night can become invisible.

541
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,880
Okay, so this is base...

542
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,900
Where's my ult then?

543
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,080
Do I have an ult?

544
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,340
Oh, I guess it's the eternal...

545
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,080
No.

546
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,560
Wait, what is my ult?

547
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,960
Is my Q, right?

548
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,100
Perform three... Is the three rapid dashes?

549
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,760
Okay, I guess that's the ult.

550
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,280
Creating a healing over time field in the impact area.

551
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,020
Okay, so this is a damage one.

552
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,620
A terror cape damages people and like makes damage boosts.

553
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:19,880
So this damage boosts and then this one gives a healing boost.

554
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,360
Jesus Christ.

555
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,920
Okay, I hope she's not meta.

556
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:23,720
I...

557
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,540
Oh my god.

558
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:26,920
Okay.

559
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,020
Alright.

560
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,780
We'll figure it out.

561
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,460
We'll figure it out.

562
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,900
Then we have Iron Fist.

563
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,740
This guy's four star.

564
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,380
He has... Oh my...

565
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,720
I was gonna say, this guy's four star.

566
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,040
He's one guy.

567
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:48,480
And then I see like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten abilities.

568
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:49,540
Okay.

569
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,280
This is...

570
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,820
You're literally playing...

571
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,800
You're literally playing a fighting game at that point.

572
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,620
You're...

573
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,780
It's literally... Look at all these combos you can do.

574
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,500
Alright.

575
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,780
Oh, he can wall run.

576
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,320
He has more moves than a character that has literally two in one.

577
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:17,080
Oh my... Guys, I know what I'm not... There's suggested combos?

578
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,280
Oh my god.

579
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,460
That can be like...

580
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:24,880
Okay.

581
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:25,380
Alright.

582
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,380
So...

583
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,320
So there is...

584
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,380
All that stuff.

585
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:29,780
Okay.

586
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,320
And then we have Jeff the Shark.

587
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,580
I saw the trailer for this guy before.

588
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,140
He's so cute.

589
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,200
He's really cute.

590
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,580
What does he do?

591
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,100
Where is his com... Oh my god.

592
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,960
The fuck is that?

593
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,280
Incognito Dolphin?

594
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:43,760
Wait...

595
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,100
It's like...

596
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,480
I'm... The brightest thing on the fucking map.

597
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,180
Alright.

598
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,680
Joyful Splash.

599
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,100
Oh, he's easy.

600
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,180
Unleash a heal... Oh, he's also a healer.

601
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,380
There's so many supports now.

602
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:58,420
Wait.

603
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,840
There's so many supports.

604
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,260
Okay.

605
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,200
Left is healing.

606
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,300
And then deep dive into sea and reach for his swallow.

607
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,960
Activating hide and seek before ejecting the sw... What the fuck?

608
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,440
Oh, I can spit enemies.

609
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,080
Wait.

610
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,460
Oh, I can save people.

611
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:16,640
Wait.

612
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,100
I can like... I can like...

613
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:18,600
Okay.

614
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,900
I can also... Okay.

615
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:25,760
The bad thing about this guy is that you can definitely grief your team.

616
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:29,740
You take your teammates and then like spit them off.

617
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,920
He's basically Symmetra.

618
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,260
But worse, because I don't think they can...

619
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,820
I don't think you can like leave his mouth.

620
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,020
So you can grief really hard.

621
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,500
I was just thinking you can eat people off the map.

622
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,920
Jeff can heal while submerged and gain a wall crawl.

623
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:49,300
Okay.

624
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,440
And then healing spit bubble that heals the allies who collect.

625
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:57,080
Granting them a healing boost and a movement boost while also launching up nearby enemies.

626
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:58,580
Okay.

627
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,940
So like what does the bubble do if I hit him?

628
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:01,920
Oh.

629
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:02,340
Wait.

630
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,220
That's...

631
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,520
Pick my bubble!

632
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,340
Pick it up!

633
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,040
Reduces damage taken.

634
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:10,400
Oh.

635
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,940
So he can't get critical hit.

636
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,900
And then there's team up with...

637
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,020
Can ride on Groot's shoulder.

638
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,600
Oh, I can ride on Groot's shoulder for this.

639
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,000
I guess he can...

640
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,740
Oh, it's like Raccoon and Groot.

641
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,180
Okay.

642
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,240
Alright.

643
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,340
So we got that page done.

644
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,480
What else is new?

645
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,000
Moon Knight is the new one too.

646
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,820
I heard there's like a lot of DPS too.

647
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,360
So many healers, but Loki is still our favorite.

648
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,040
Pudge top!

649
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,020
Thank you for the super chat.

650
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:38,800
Thank you.

651
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:39,940
The only...

652
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:46,260
The only thing that sucks about the Loki during beta test got like hella nerfed.

653
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,720
So like, I don't know if he's good again because like they nerfed Loki so hard.

654
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,180
Mike, thank you for the super chat.

655
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:54,860
Thank you, thank you.

656
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,060
I'm downloading Rivals right now and hope you have fun playing as well.

657
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,000
Yeah, I'm so excited to try out the new characters.

658
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:07,480
I'm really excited to try out the new characters for the launch itself.

659
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,680
They revealed so many!

660
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:22,000
I was not expecting them to reveal so many at once on launch date because that means there's gonna because like, you know, every other game would take a while like releasing new characters every couple of months.

661
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,540
So that means they're gonna be adding more to this game later.

662
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,460
Because they're not stopping.

663
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,580
Also, I saw like it's basically Batman.

664
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,560
Yeah, there's grappling hook.

665
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,760
There's the night glider.

666
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,060
There's...

667
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,040
Okay, there's a knockdown.

668
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,720
There's a rising leaps.

669
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,280
I guess that's like double jump too.

670
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,200
It's Batman but like Marvel Rivals.

671
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,160
No, Doki!

672
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,960
You can't say that!

673
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:57,200
Batman but like with actual powers instead of money.

674
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,580
Wait, did I miss Hawkeye?

675
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,740
Sorry, everybody always forgets about Hawkeye.

676
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,160
I mean, it looks pretty cool.

677
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,700
Oh, look!

678
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,380
There's Clint!

679
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,360
There's a... what's his name?

680
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,740
The guy in the event.

681
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,420
Oh my god.

682
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,720
Oh my god, what's his name?

683
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,440
What's the actor?

684
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,340
Jeremy Renner!

685
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,880
Jeremy Renner Hawkeye!

686
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,820
Oh my god, they added Jeremy Renner Hawkeye!

687
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,760
Let's freaking go!

688
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,740
Let's see.

689
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,920
Okay, so I heard if you have your crosshair on the head, it's even stronger.

690
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,100
Shoot three explosive, hunter sight.

691
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,700
That's the Shiva Katana.

692
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,800
Shoot a hypersonic, dealing two instances of damage to enemies and pathfinding, flicking them.

693
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,120
White Batman, my beloved!

694
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,540
Frango, thank you for the Akasupa!

695
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,980
Thank you!

696
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,140
Alright, let's see.

697
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,300
Ronan Slash?

698
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,940
Wait, Ronan Slash?

699
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:57,470
Yeah, he's Clint Barton.

700
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,070
Why is it Ronan?

701
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:02,110
Is this sword from...

702
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,430
Wait, I thought he's from New York.

703
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:05,010
I...

704
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,730
Wait, okay, I'm a little confused.

705
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,070
Is that part of the lore?

706
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:16,770
Is that his other name?

707
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:19,810
I was like, I thought he was...

708
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:21,250
Oh, he was a Ronan for a while?

709
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,230
I didn't know that!

710
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,450
I didn't know that!

711
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,250
I thought he was...

712
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,530
He had a weeb face?

713
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:28,810
I didn't know that!

714
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:32,390
I thought he, like, lived in New York!

715
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,450
Oh my god!

716
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:38,130
I didn't know he became a Ronan for a little bit.

717
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:38,910
I was a little confused.

718
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,630
I was like, Ronan Slash?

719
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:41,550
What?

720
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,270
No.

721
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:53,150
I stopped watching Avengers because I realized that Marvel movies are all the same at one point.

722
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,510
So I stopped.

723
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,270
I never saw her abilities though.

724
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:02,050
I like how she's like, the easiest character to play.

725
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:07,710
She's the easiest character to play, but like, she's apparently the strongest Marvel hero.

726
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,190
Rocket upwards with bounce of her tail.

727
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,910
Reloads squirrel blockade.

728
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:18,350
Imprisoning the first...

729
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:21,690
Oh my god, you can trap them with your squirrels?

730
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:23,050
Wait, oh!

731
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:26,010
Wait, that's fucking...

732
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,190
That's hardcore, bro.

733
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:29,630
Thor.

734
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,690
Oh, we did Thor!

735
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:33,250
That's Thor, Winter Soldier, and Wolverine.

736
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,130
Oh my god, Thor is back.

737
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,490
Okay.

738
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,270
Miramar's Bash.

739
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:39,450
God of Thunder.

740
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:42,530
Jesus Christ.

741
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,350
There's so many.

742
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:44,950
I assume these two are also...

743
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,870
Yeah, that... Okay, that's a tank.

744
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:47,950
He's a DPS.

745
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:48,830
He has to be.

746
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,410
Alright, let's see.

747
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:55,910
Is he just Reaper?

748
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:00,850
Leap hide in Dash 4 and slam down with Bionic Arm, dealing damage to enemies.

749
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:06,870
Dash 4, seizing enemies along the path and launch up enemies in front to end of the dash.

750
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,810
His gun seems like a shotgun.

751
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:15,030
Charge up and launch a powerful electric punch with Bionic Arms, but with range.

752
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,990
Charge up and launch a hook with Bionic Reeling.

753
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:20,150
Oh my god.

754
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,210
Okay.

755
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:22,990
That's scary.

756
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:26,590
Wait, he's Doomfist.

757
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:27,790
Oh no.

758
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,090
Oh no.

759
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:38,090
Oh no.

760
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:39,010
Oh no.

761
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:41,050
He's Doomfist with a shotgun.

762
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,490
Does he really need a shotgun?

763
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:44,330
He has...

764
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:49,150
He has a Roadhog hook and...

765
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:51,150
Oh my god, he has a Roadhog.

766
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:54,050
DPS Doom is back, baby.

767
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,570
Doomfist with a gun.

768
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:59,270
That's actually...

769
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,530
And a Roadhog hook.

770
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:01,950
That's scary as fuck.

771
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:02,850
Holy shit.

772
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,150
Oh my god.

773
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:09,630
The scariest things about Doomfist mains is that they are not...

774
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:18,670
They're not afraid to like grind hundreds of hours trying to figure out every single rollout you can on one map.

775
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,990
Like, that's what I'm scared of.

776
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:24,890
I'm scared of the Winter Soldier rollouts.

777
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,470
Savage Claw.

778
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:34,090
Good lord, why is he so wide?

779
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:36,130
Wait, do we not have Mr. Fantastic yet?

780
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:37,810
Is he not here yet?

781
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,350
No, he's not part of the initial launch?

782
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:40,970
No!

783
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,230
Wait, there's DPS too.

784
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,190
There's so many melee characters now.

785
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:49,110
I feel like a lot of them...

786
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:51,250
A lot of the melee...

787
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:55,750
A lot of the newer release characters are mostly melee.

788
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,390
So that's a little scary.

789
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:00,150
That's actually... Oh, no Mr. Fantastic.

790
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:00,990
I know.

791
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:01,850
I'm so sad.

792
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,570
Okay, so I can regenerate healing.

793
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:06,130
So this is basically he doesn't have to worry about heals.

794
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:07,930
Alright, it's time.

795
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,770
Oh yeah, guys, I forgot.

796
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:10,770
I need to check my settings.

797
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:12,410
Guys, I forgot.

798
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,650
I don't even... Oh my god.

799
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,190
Not windowed, that's for sure.

800
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:17,650
Alright, let's see.

801
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:18,870
Quality...

802
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,890
I need to know if like...

803
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:23,410
uh... high graphics.

804
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:24,310
Okay, medium.

805
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:25,250
We'll do medium.

806
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:28,330
I'm not really into the whole...

807
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,610
I don't know if it... I don't know if it transfers over.

808
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:32,590
That's the thing.

809
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,730
It might not transfer over.

810
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,530
So, we'll see.

811
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:38,510
Push to talk.

812
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,930
Mic volume, voice chat, yes.

813
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,970
Yeah, we'll get the subtitles too.

814
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,990
I want to know what they're talking about.

815
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,430
Uh, keyboard.

816
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:49,030
Oh, is that default?

817
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,940
That's default.

818
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,140
Guys, what were my settings?

819
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,120
Oh!

820
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,160
No!

821
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,380
Guys, give me a sec.

822
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,260
No!

823
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,280
It didn't transfer over?

824
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,400
Are you serious?

825
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,400
No!

826
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,740
Oh my God.

827
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,920
Okay, guys, I'm sorry.

828
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:18,640
I have to...

829
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,480
I have to...

830
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,100
Oh my God.

831
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,600
I'm so sad.

832
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,780
It doesn't transfer over.

833
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,340
I have to figure this out.

834
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,680
I thought it... Guys, tell me what my...

835
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,280
Guys, I need a note.

836
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,940
What is my...

837
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,540
What is...

838
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,740
What is my fucking sense, guys?

839
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,820
That's the only thing I need to figure out.

840
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,580
Everything else I'm fine with.

841
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,400
Okay.

842
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,300
We'll do a dot.

843
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,980
Actually, I'm good with either.

844
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,000
I'm good with crosshair and dot.

845
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,380
We'll do crosshair just so... I don't know.

846
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,040
I feel like crosshair today.

847
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,780
Outline details, blur details, cross... How do I make it so it doesn't fucking rotate?

848
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,380
Uh... No animation.

849
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,380
There you go.

850
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,120
No animation.

851
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,560
Okay, we got...

852
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,680
Get that down.

853
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,200
Uh... Lampacity, blur, center gap.

854
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,860
There you go.

855
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,200
And then length.

856
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,560
Get that smaller.

857
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,400
Alright, there we go.

858
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,760
I should be fine.

859
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,180
1.09?

860
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:24,880
Okay.

861
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:25,920
1.09.

862
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,120
I can't believe it didn't transfer over.

863
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,160
You assume it does.

864
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,160
Cause like, I basically kept everything the same.

865
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,120
WASD, jump, melee.

866
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,200
Okay, that.

867
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,580
And then...

868
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,900
Melee, it's inbounded.

869
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,400
And then push to talk.

870
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,960
UI, communication, ping.

871
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,380
Number of attacks.

872
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,320
Sorry, I'm getting a little serious right now.

873
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,980
Because I'm going into Overwatch mode.

874
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,040
I'm going...

875
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:53,740
Uh...

876
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,480
Let's see.

877
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,180
That should be good.

878
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:00,120
I'm going to like, serious mode right now when I do all that.

879
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:00,480
Alright!

880
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,800
I think we're okay now.

881
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,600
We don't need tutorial.

882
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,640
We basically played this game like three times already.

883
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,500
Wait.

884
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,080
Alright.

885
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,280
Let's see.

886
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,040
I'm going... I'm feeling a little sweaty right now.

887
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:20,540
Alright.

888
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,060
Jesus Christ, there's so many...

889
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,600
Oh my God, look at that.

890
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,040
Oh my God, there's...

891
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,520
Look at... This is all the DPS.

892
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,680
Holy shit.

893
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,040
Okay, I want to try.

894
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,120
Let's try Scroll Girl.

895
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:36,960
Let's try.

896
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,600
I heard... Apparently I was talking to Surefour about it.

897
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,640
And then...

898
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:48,040
Because like, he was like talking about people were complaining that like there were too many DPS characters.

899
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:53,500
And then the devs responded back and was like, yeah, because we want DPS to be able to kill things.

900
00:38:54,860 --> 00:39:01,120
They were like, yeah, because we're trying to make sure people who play DPS actually have fun and can actually kill things.

901
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:02,960
So...

902
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,640
Let's see.

903
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,060
Whoa.

904
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,480
Is it 1.09?

905
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,120
Is that actually my sense?

906
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:08,740
I can't tell.

907
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,480
Okay, there's the...

908
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,660
Where is that seed going?

909
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,300
Okay.

910
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,600
And then...

911
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,680
Oh, I got the team up.

912
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,400
Nice.

913
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,920
Whee!

914
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,360
What does my E do?

915
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,520
I already forgot.

916
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,620
Oh, no!

917
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,900
I don't remember what my E does!

918
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,020
Oh, no.

919
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,840
Is she Junkrat?

920
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,060
I don't like him or... Oh, wait.

921
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,680
Unless... Oh, shit!

922
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:45,740
Okay.

923
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,020
Wait, actually, I might like her.

924
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,740
She's so easy!

925
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,060
I literally just throw this around.

926
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,400
There we go.

927
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,540
Alright, easy.

928
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:04,050
I just throw these around until people die.

929
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,900
I don't want this!

930
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,480
She's so fucking easy.

931
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,240
Holy shit!

932
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,940
I just take the angles and that's it.

933
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,820
Fucking easiest game of my life.

934
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:22,720
Honestly.

935
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,360
Let me just stay there.

936
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:27,660
Nice.

937
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,460
Goodbye, guys.

938
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,460
Take the angle.

939
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,300
And now I can do this.

940
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:35,420
Pew!

941
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:36,780
Pew!

942
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,140
Alright, let's go!

943
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:39,560
You know what?

944
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,900
Fucking go, squirrel!

945
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:41,540
Go!

946
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,100
Who fucking cares?

947
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,120
Oh, my God.

948
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,380
That was the easiest fucking game of my life.

949
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,980
November is over.

950
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:50,620
You're right.

951
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,100
It's nutting time.

952
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,940
Go in.

953
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,960
Go in, squirrel girl!

954
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,280
Just spawn cap them.

955
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,900
Take this angle.

956
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,420
Never have to move again.

957
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:04,200
Never.

958
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:08,680
Just stay there for the rest of your life.

959
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,760
Just keep staying there.

960
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,800
Alright, let's go!

961
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,020
Non-stop nutting!

962
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,440
Oh, my God.

963
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,120
This is so fucking cringe.

964
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,400
Holy shit.

965
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,440
Yeah, that's right!

966
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,540
Keep going at it!

967
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,680
Oh, shit.

968
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,540
I'm so sorry.

969
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,780
Or am I?

970
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,020
Alright.

971
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:35,780
Boom.

972
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,820
I don't even have to aim.

973
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,340
I'm just throwing as many nuts as I can.

974
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,380
I'm not even aiming anymore.

975
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:49,320
Like, I'm just putting in a general range and it's working.

976
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,420
God, I love squirrel girl.

977
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,460
Actually, easiest game of my life.

978
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,220
Let's go.

979
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,680
Yeah, squirrel girl!

980
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,300
Let's go!

981
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,480
No wonder she's like one star.

982
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,260
Holy fuck.

983
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,600
I've now realized why she's one star, guys.

984
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,040
Oh, they're playing squirrel girl!

985
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,180
Oh, yeah!

986
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,780
There can only be one squirrel girl.

987
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,240
That's fucking right.

988
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,980
How dare you.

989
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,660
How fucking dare you.

990
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,320
There can only be...

991
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:22,720
Oh, no.

992
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,520
He ate.

993
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,720
Wait, I saw him fucking...

994
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,320
Nom, nom, nom.

995
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,280
Okay, that's fine.

996
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,700
We got him.

997
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,540
There's only you, Captain America.

998
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,220
They're all dead.

999
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:35,760
They're all dead.

1000
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,000
They're all dead.

1001
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,580
Captain America, I don't think anybody's gonna be assembling.

1002
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,280
How am I...

1003
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,140
Oh, my God.

1004
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,340
It's okay.

1005
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,500
There can only be one nutter.

1006
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,920
How much...

1007
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,600
How much...

1008
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,100
I'm not even gonna wash.

1009
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,860
I'm not...

1010
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:01,100
Wait, I'm still hitting them.

1011
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:01,760
Alright.

1012
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,780
Boom.

1013
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,080
And then, more nuts.

1014
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,420
That's right.

1015
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,540
Keep nutting.

1016
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:09,620
Oh, my God.

1017
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,780
There's so many tanks now.

1018
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,700
Keep nutting.

1019
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,000
You've got this, squirrel girl.

1020
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:16,880
Just keep nutting.

1021
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:19,060
They'll die eventually.

1022
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,420
They have a learning problem.

1023
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,920
Just keep nutting.

1024
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,080
Throw all the squirrels out.

1025
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,480
There's nobody here.

1026
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,120
It's okay.

1027
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:34,060
Goodbye, tsunami.

1028
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,140
Goodbye.

1029
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,820
The enemy has, like, zero kills.

1030
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,500
I don't think they know what they're doing.

1031
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:42,920
Like...

1032
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,580
I'm literally just taking high ground here.

1033
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,740
And then...

1034
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:48,840
And then, just nut.

1035
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,220
Like, look at this poor guy.

1036
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:52,560
Up top there.

1037
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:54,680
Like...

1038
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,260
You know what?

1039
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,160
Great first game.

1040
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:58,880
Not gonna lie.

1041
00:43:59,180 --> 00:43:59,720
Oh, shit.

1042
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:00,780
It's alright.

1043
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,760
We got Bruce Banner out of his D.Va mech.

1044
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:04,860
That's fine.

1045
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,440
That's fine.

1046
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:09,820
There you go.

1047
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:10,520
Easy.

1048
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,720
What a great first game.

1049
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,120
I knew picking this character wasn't the right thing to do.

1050
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,300
I don't think I've, like, moved at all.

1051
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,900
Like, I honestly don't think I have moved.

1052
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:32,160
I'm just, like, hoping I hit something, and I do.

1053
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:34,820
Oh, shit!

1054
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:35,980
Oh, wait!

1055
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:36,800
People are dying!

1056
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:38,580
That's fine.

1057
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:39,060
That's fine.

1058
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,200
I have this angle.

1059
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:43,900
That's okay.

1060
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:49,040
I can clutch this.

1061
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,220
I just keep shooting this angle.

1062
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,240
I might hit something.

1063
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:59,040
As long as I'm here, I'll hit something.

1064
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:00,960
Alright.

1065
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,500
There we go.

1066
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,360
Alright, tsunami time!

1067
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,980
Go, squirrels, go!

1068
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,080
Go, squirrels!

1069
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,760
Just keep hitting!

1070
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,100
Oh, they're all stuck!

1071
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:13,720
They're all stuck!

1072
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,480
Interaction game.

1073
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:20,480
I am doing my best here.

1074
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:21,700
Alright, guys.

1075
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,280
Party's still alive.

1076
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:28,940
Like, I'm literally farming damage.

1077
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,700
I'm just farming damage on them.

1078
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:36,900
Okay, nice.

1079
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,080
Get him out of his mech suit.

1080
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,660
Get boost battery out of his mech.

1081
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,420
Wow, that was...

1082
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:47,120
That's just...

1083
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,000
Oh, it only works if you hit him.

1084
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,020
Is this an idle clicker?

1085
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,380
What did Loki do?

1086
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,480
Holy shit!

1087
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:58,020
Okay, I had the most...

1088
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,400
What did Loki...

1089
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,440
How is he MVP?

1090
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,000
Look at my damage!

1091
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:08,240
I literally just spammed the corner!

1092
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:09,580
Guys!

1093
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,300
What the...

1094
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,120
How the fuck...

1095
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,140
Oh my god, I literally just...

1096
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:20,120
I literally was just in that corner and it never left.

1097
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:24,620
Easiest 12k of my life.

1098
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,320
Yeah, because he just needs to aim!

1099
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:33,200
I did so much...

1100
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,160
I did so much damage!

1101
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,200
I was just nutting in the corner.

1102
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,800
Just keep throwing nuts!

1103
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:42,180
Alright.

1104
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:43,180
Let's see.

1105
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,540
Let's try another DPS character.

1106
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:45,420
Okay.

1107
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:46,940
You know what?

1108
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:48,160
Let's try...

1109
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,200
Oh my god, we got walls now!

1110
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,100
Okay, I should read.

1111
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,920
Oh my god, wait.

1112
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,300
Where's her ability?

1113
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:56,680
Okay.

1114
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:58,380
Baton.

1115
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,360
Okay.

1116
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,140
Dash forward.

1117
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,780
Unleash a spinning kick to launch enemies.

1118
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,120
Switch to...

1119
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,240
Okay, we got snipe.

1120
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:08,500
This is all melee.

1121
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,500
Her ability is mostly melee.

1122
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,660
Alright, from 1 star to like 4 star.

1123
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,300
It shouldn't be that difficult.

1124
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:21,220
I think I might have got MMR adjusted already.

1125
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:22,920
Maybe.

1126
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,080
Oh shit!

1127
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:25,820
We have Nut Girl!

1128
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,240
Oh my god, I can run!

1129
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,140
Guys, it's okay.

1130
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,080
What was the C again?

1131
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,080
Guys, what was...

1132
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,620
I might have forgot what C does.

1133
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:42,860
Guys...

1134
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:43,820
Oh my god, we have Nut Girl.

1135
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,020
It's already GG's.

1136
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,560
I don't know, but keep jumping!

1137
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,060
Okay, but I need to know what does C do.

1138
00:47:58,900 --> 00:47:59,520
Oh god.

1139
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:07,370
Oh shit!

1140
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:08,870
Oh shit, not magic!

1141
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:11,430
Oh my god, I'm scared!

1142
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,080
Okay, there we go.

1143
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,460
Oh, come on.

1144
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,600
You can't do that forever.

1145
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:33,700
What?

1146
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:45,270
Holy shit though!

1147
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:47,350
Her damage is insane!

1148
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:50,150
Her damage is actually crazy.

1149
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:51,150
I'm gonna admit.

1150
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:55,570
Her damage is so fucking insane.

1151
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:57,370
Like, that was a tank by the way.

1152
00:48:57,510 --> 00:49:01,330
I shot Doctor Strange and he's supposed to be a fucking tank.

1153
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:02,470
Oh fuck!

1154
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:02,850
No!

1155
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:03,310
No!

1156
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:09,550
Oh no, not the cloak man.

1157
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:10,770
Oh no!

1158
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:13,190
No, not cloak man!

1159
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:19,250
Oh my god, wait, is it...

1160
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:20,770
Wait, was C walls?

1161
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:23,190
I forgot.

1162
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:25,710
I forgot that one is...

1163
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:26,030
Melee.

1164
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:27,550
I didn't remember that I have melee.

1165
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:31,230
Okay, I have melee guys.

1166
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:33,010
Alright.

1167
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:35,170
I just gotta hit my shots.

1168
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:38,110
I need to get used to like...

1169
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:39,110
Oh god, okay.

1170
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:39,670
That's fine.

1171
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:41,370
That's fine.

1172
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:45,610
Okay, I'm getting used to the aim guys!

1173
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:47,870
I'm getting used to the aim guys!

1174
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:48,890
It's getting better!

1175
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:49,810
Oh fuck!

1176
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:50,950
Oh no!

1177
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:51,570
No!

1178
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:52,750
No, please!

1179
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:53,490
No!

1180
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:55,230
Venom!

1181
00:49:59,090 --> 00:49:59,650
No!

1182
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:02,070
Do we not have healers?

1183
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:04,570
Guys, I think it's because we don't have healers guys.

1184
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:08,190
I think it's because we don't have healers.

1185
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:09,570
It's not me!

1186
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:11,050
It's not me!

1187
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:12,830
We literally have zero healers!

1188
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,200
Jesus Christ!

1189
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,280
Oh my god.

1190
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,340
Oh my god, please!

1191
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:30,540
I have no healers!

1192
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,240
That's fine!

1193
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:35,980
I got him away from me, right?

1194
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:37,160
No I don't!

1195
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:37,760
No!

1196
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,860
Oh my god, please!

1197
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,520
Somebody also heal!

1198
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:45,960
Okay, I will...

1199
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:50,520
I am a person that's willing to heal for the team.

1200
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,640
I'm actually willing to be a team player.

1201
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,120
What the fuck?

1202
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,960
How are you letting him do that?

1203
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,720
Just fucking...

1204
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,220
Just hit him!

1205
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,800
Oh my god!

1206
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,320
Just hit him!

1207
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:14,420
Okay.

1208
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,640
Now I'll swap to healer.

1209
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,980
Okay, how do I play him?

1210
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,320
I'm just saying it's not me, it's my team.

1211
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:28,580
I am willing to be a team player, guys.

1212
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:31,900
Get the bubble!

1213
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,780
There's so many bubbles!

1214
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:35,660
Get it!

1215
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:38,660
Oh my god, get the bubble!

1216
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:43,900
Please!

1217
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:53,890
Just get the bubble!

1218
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:58,590
I'm big of you!

1219
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:00,530
There's so many bubbles!

1220
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:04,050
Oh my god.

1221
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:09,310
Please, I'm blowing so many bubbles, what do you want from me?

1222
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:11,930
All I do is blow bubbles!

1223
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:14,230
That's all I do!

1224
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:22,490
Bro, you're fucking trash.

1225
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:25,470
You're actually trash.

1226
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:28,230
Just take the bubble!

1227
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:31,370
Just take it!

1228
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:34,690
Oh my god.

1229
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:35,150
Okay.

1230
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:37,290
Alright.

1231
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:42,050
Okay.

1232
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:44,130
Bubble, bubble, bubble!

1233
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:45,670
Just grab it!

1234
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:48,250
Oh shit!

1235
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:50,350
Get it!

1236
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:56,760
Oh my god, he solo ulted me!

1237
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,660
He sharked me back!

1238
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:02,340
He actually sharked me back!

1239
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:03,440
Okay, I'm coming back.

1240
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:07,020
Guys, I can shark him too!

1241
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:09,100
Grab it!

1242
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,360
Okay, don't worry, I got you!

1243
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:13,480
Bubble, bubble!

1244
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:19,200
Okay.

1245
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:20,420
Okay.

1246
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,120
That's fucking right.

1247
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:26,560
That's fucking right.

1248
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,980
That's right, I'm leaving!

1249
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:29,380
Goodbye!

1250
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,080
Bubble, bubble, bubble!

1251
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:34,920
There we go.

1252
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:36,760
Spit!

1253
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:38,480
Alright.

1254
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,520
Oh my god, bro, I hate this guy.

1255
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:44,220
I actually hate him so much.

1256
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,140
That's fucking right!

1257
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,000
You can't do shit!

1258
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,380
I have 20 bubbles here!

1259
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,060
What you gonna do?

1260
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,100
I have infinite bubbles!

1261
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,220
Okay, I can literally just spit here.

1262
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:02,380
There we go.

1263
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:04,580
It's fine.

1264
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:06,400
I'm better.

1265
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:07,580
Oh no!

1266
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,360
Oh my god, they took my friends!

1267
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,940
Okay, that's fine.

1268
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:15,040
Get over here, Scarlet!

1269
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:17,840
Oh no.

1270
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:20,160
It's okay.

1271
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,780
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew!

1272
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:24,740
Pew, pew, pew!

1273
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:26,340
Pew, pew!

1274
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:27,140
Oh!

1275
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,560
Okay, I think our venom might be...

1276
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:31,860
Oh!

1277
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,840
Where did it all go?

1278
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,300
Where did it all go?

1279
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:42,580
Okay.

1280
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,620
Don't worry, guys, you got...

1281
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:45,600
Guys, push him!

1282
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,640
Okay, I...

1283
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,660
I'm just saying that it wasn't me.

1284
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:54,940
For sure, I...

1285
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,560
I'm literally MVP!

1286
00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:58,940
Wait, I'm not.

1287
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,460
That's the enemy lip.

1288
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,040
What?

1289
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,420
That's the enemy?

1290
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,420
Oh yeah, he did 12k healing.

1291
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,340
Yeah, I was gonna be like, that's me!

1292
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,840
Oh, I'm SVP!

1293
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,900
That's even worse!

1294
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:14,320
I'm actually my team's MVP!

1295
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:20,580
What the fuck, guys?

1296
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:22,620
I swapped to a healer and I'm still...

1297
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:23,680
I'm...

1298
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,580
I still have more damage?

1299
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:29,420
Okay, now I know it's not me.

1300
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:34,660
Now I know.

1301
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:36,940
Now I definitely know it's not me.

1302
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:46,850
Okay, C is the walls.

1303
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:47,490
Now I know.

1304
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:50,790
Cause I thought it's like I have to wait until Hawkeye...

1305
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:54,690
I thought that Hawkeye has to ult and then I get walls.

1306
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:57,050
But apparently...

1307
00:55:57,050 --> 00:55:58,690
I have ability walls.

1308
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:00,330
Which is pretty crazy.

1309
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:03,610
I feel like that's like really broken.

1310
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:04,750
Okay, Hawkeye.

1311
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:08,610
Okay, what do I do for Hawkeye?

1312
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:11,370
Shoot a powerful arrow.

1313
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:12,690
Shoot three explosive arrows.

1314
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:15,750
Capture afterimages of enemies.

1315
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:18,570
Unsheathe a katana and slash forward.

1316
00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:24,790
Shoot a hypersonic arrow, dealing two instances of damage to enemy's path, inflicting slow.

1317
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:27,250
Oh fuck, I didn't get a chance to read everything.

1318
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:28,050
I...

1319
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:32,030
Oh my god, I got overwhelmed.

1320
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:33,050
Okay.

1321
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:35,390
I can still read it.

1322
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:39,270
Okay, I can double jump and I can swing a katana.

1323
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:39,890
Alright.

1324
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:41,670
Increase focus.

1325
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:43,710
Okay, dealing two damage.

1326
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:44,930
Okay, that's slow.

1327
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:46,550
And the ship is...

1328
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:48,470
I can... Okay, that's fine.

1329
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:50,790
I most likely will not change...

1330
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:53,270
Uh...

1331
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:57,090
Most likely I might not change...

1332
00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:57,950
Okay.

1333
00:56:58,550 --> 00:57:02,370
I might not change the...

1334
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:04,570
changed explosives.

1335
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:06,670
Cause I feel like... I don't know.

1336
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:08,030
I feel like normal is better.

1337
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:12,810
I guess explosive, I have like a limit for it.

1338
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:18,410
Okay.

1339
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:19,010
Okay.

1340
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:20,810
We'll see how this goes.

1341
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:21,930
Do we have healers?

1342
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:24,510
Guys, I don't see a healer with us.

1343
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:27,750
Guys.

1344
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:31,550
Oh, we have rocket.

1345
00:57:31,730 --> 00:57:32,510
Okay, that's good.

1346
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:35,690
We have rocket.

1347
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:37,730
That's fine.

1348
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:38,990
We have rocket, right?

1349
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:40,430
That's okay.

1350
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:41,970
Guys.

1351
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:46,150
Is our tank tanking?

1352
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:48,510
That's what I wanna know.

1353
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:52,150
I wanna know.

1354
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:54,690
Guys, how come they get a shield?

1355
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:00,890
That's so cool.

1356
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:03,190
I wish we had that too.

1357
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:07,530
Hey, Captain America.

1358
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:10,070
Do you maybe shield us a little better?

1359
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:11,910
You know?

1360
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:15,570
Nice.

1361
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:18,510
There we go.

1362
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:20,550
That's fucking right.

1363
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:22,430
I might change my crosshair.

1364
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:23,470
I don't like the...

1365
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:25,650
I think I might just go with the dot crosshair.

1366
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:28,370
I don't like...

1367
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:29,910
Not a big fan of just that.

1368
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:31,970
I don't know.

1369
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:33,790
That's just my opinion.

1370
00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:35,750
Not a huge fan of it.

1371
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:39,770
Okay.

1372
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:40,130
Oh, she's slow.

1373
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:40,690
She's slow.

1374
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:44,610
Okay.

1375
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:46,530
I'll get the explosives though.

1376
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:48,870
Oh, okay.

1377
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:49,530
It's not charged.

1378
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:52,910
Okay, so there's like a low range for that.

1379
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:53,970
Okay, now I know.

1380
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:55,610
Now I know.

1381
00:58:59,530 --> 00:58:59,990
Come on.

1382
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:00,590
Peek me.

1383
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:03,810
That's fucking right, bitch!

1384
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:06,250
That's right!

1385
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:07,190
Oh!

1386
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:11,170
Alright, this is pretty easy.

1387
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:12,670
Okay, I'm gonna take high ground then.

1388
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:14,650
I think I can take high ground.

1389
00:59:15,390 --> 00:59:16,610
Oh my god, there's Spider-Man.

1390
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:19,330
Oh no, Spider-Man.

1391
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:21,390
Oh no, Spider-Man.

1392
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:23,850
Okay, I can do this then.

1393
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:26,950
Since...

1394
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:27,370
Alright.

1395
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:30,330
Oh my god!

1396
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:32,510
He's jumping everywhere he goes!

1397
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:32,810
He knows!

1398
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:35,850
It's too fast!

1399
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:39,830
Alright, walls!

1400
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:42,470
Wait, what?

1401
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:46,630
Oh my god, what's the use of walls when...

1402
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:49,570
Okay, this clutters my screen.

1403
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:51,570
Okay!

1404
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:54,570
Guys, I don't think I like walls.

1405
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:57,070
I don't think I like it at all.

1406
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:02,010
The walls is so...

1407
01:00:02,010 --> 01:00:03,490
It's a little bit too much.

1408
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:04,550
That's for sure.

1409
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:05,010
Oh no!

1410
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:05,790
Oh no!

1411
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:07,510
Oh no!

1412
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:09,850
Please!

1413
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:12,290
Please, I'm just a little guy!

1414
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:16,550
It's not walls!

1415
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:19,190
It's not walls at all!

1416
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:21,670
Wait, what does it do?

1417
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:23,990
Okay, damage.

1418
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:25,550
Okay, I just gotta hit the afterimage.

1419
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:25,950
Okay.

1420
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:27,630
I figured it out.

1421
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:29,870
I need to hit the afterimage.

1422
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:31,450
I need to change my crosshair.

1423
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:33,070
I do not like the...

1424
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:37,110
I need to... This is the first time I've done, like, dot and the crosshair.

1425
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:39,070
And the cross.

1426
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:40,470
Not a big fan!

1427
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:42,090
Not gonna lie.

1428
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:45,310
Not a big fan of that.

1429
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:49,370
I keep thinking I'm using shift.

1430
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:50,550
Oh no.

1431
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:52,550
Okay, I need to jump up.

1432
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:54,570
Where's my double jump?

1433
01:00:55,390 --> 01:00:55,670
Please.

1434
01:00:57,550 --> 01:00:58,050
Oh, nice.

1435
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:00,470
Double jump's a cooldown because my legs get tired.

1436
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:06,430
My legs get tired.

1437
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:11,630
You should be tired now.

1438
01:01:12,430 --> 01:01:14,210
Get him out of mech!

1439
01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:17,750
Nice, we got him out of mech!

1440
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:21,710
He's so low, guys!

1441
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:26,450
Guys, there's a storm here too!

1442
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:28,430
Okay.

1443
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:32,110
That's fine.

1444
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:35,370
Okay.

1445
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:36,850
That's fine.

1446
01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:38,370
We're gonna use explosive here.

1447
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:42,850
I think explosives is, like, you gotta be close range for it.

1448
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:43,870
For sure.

1449
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:46,730
Okay.

1450
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:46,810
Okay.

1451
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:50,650
Maybe I'll hit... oh no, not him again!

1452
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:53,790
Oh my god, she's gonna clap!

1453
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:55,490
Clap!

1454
01:01:57,470 --> 01:01:58,290
Oh, shit!

1455
01:01:58,430 --> 01:01:59,270
Okay, that's not good.

1456
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:03,470
That's right.

1457
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:06,950
Oh, yes!

1458
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:08,050
Oh, thank god!

1459
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:08,770
Please heal me!

1460
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:10,490
Please!

1461
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:11,150
I'm carrying!

1462
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:15,010
I'm literally literally carrying!

1463
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:15,750
Please!

1464
01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:17,370
I need heals!

1465
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:19,190
I'm in front of you!

1466
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:25,370
Okay, this ult is actually crazy.

1467
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:26,810
I figured out how to use it.

1468
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,400
Oh my god, please!

1469
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:33,940
No way!

1470
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:36,900
I almost killed him!

1471
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,100
But they actually have healers!

1472
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:43,140
Stop it!

1473
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,280
They actually have healers!

1474
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,520
She's like, what do I do?

1475
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:53,000
That's not fair!

1476
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:55,700
Okay.

1477
01:02:59,260 --> 01:02:59,700
Okay.

1478
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,200
Okay, nice.

1479
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,060
We got him out of mech.

1480
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:05,600
He's out of mech now.

1481
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:09,100
Alright.

1482
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:11,280
I can literally be in this corner.

1483
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:11,320
I can literally be in this corner.

1484
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:15,460
Nice load.

1485
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,940
Oh my god, I wish we had shields like that.

1486
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:22,460
We don't care about accuracy here.

1487
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:25,380
We just gotta...

1488
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:27,100
Oh god, he's hulking out though.

1489
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:30,040
We're just logging.

1490
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:38,760
You know, we appreciate the effort though.

1491
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:42,420
But maybe don't stand in front of a sniper.

1492
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:44,640
Like, that's not it.

1493
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:46,580
That's not it.

1494
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:49,920
Literally, don't stand in front of me.

1495
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:55,000
We don't need to worry about accuracy, we just need them to like...

1496
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:56,760
Oh shit.

1497
01:03:57,620 --> 01:03:58,140
There we go.

1498
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,960
Wait, they blocked it?

1499
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:01,060
Jesus Christ.

1500
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:03,580
Nice, we got him.

1501
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:05,600
Oh shit.

1502
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,000
Oh, don't worry!

1503
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:07,980
I got you!

1504
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:09,540
Yes!

1505
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:20,740
That's fucking right.

1506
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:22,240
Wait, he's so tiny.

1507
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:26,800
His hitbox is literally like a D.Va D.Va mech head.

1508
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:27,740
Oh shit.

1509
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:33,180
That's fine, we're gonna wait for them to come over so I can use this.

1510
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:37,320
That's fucking right.

1511
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,400
Use the afterimage.

1512
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,060
Oh shit!

1513
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:45,200
Oh!

1514
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:46,920
Please!

1515
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:48,020
Dance for me!

1516
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:48,400
No!

1517
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:52,100
Oh my god!

1518
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,040
No dancing!

1519
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,920
Okay, I need to swap my crosshair, I hate it.

1520
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,260
No, I can't swap my crosshair!

1521
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:02,620
No!

1522
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:03,580
They're gonna...

1523
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,120
They're actually gonna cap this!

1524
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,980
I die and they cap!

1525
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,400
That's so fucked.

1526
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:10,440
This always happens.

1527
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:13,180
That's when you know I'm the carry guys.

1528
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:19,240
I say as I literally just missed all my shots.

1529
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:23,060
All I'm saying, I was definitely the carry here.

1530
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:26,440
I died and then I had to...

1531
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:27,820
Okay.

1532
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:30,520
I think I can see them here.

1533
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,620
Oh my god.

1534
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:36,340
Oh my god!

1535
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,160
He's gonna start smashing!

1536
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:38,920
No!

1537
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:42,660
Please!

1538
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:43,440
He's coming for me!

1539
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:46,100
I'm gonna be squishy!

1540
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:47,080
No!

1541
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:47,920
Captain America!

1542
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,160
Why did you take it from me?

1543
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:53,560
Captain America!

1544
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:56,280
You could have took it from me!

1545
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:57,740
Oh my god!

1546
01:05:57,860 --> 01:06:00,880
I need to change my reticle!

1547
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:01,840
Okay.

1548
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,300
We're gonna go with Dot.

1549
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,480
We're gonna go with Dot.

1550
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:07,280
I'm gonna try Dot out.

1551
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:12,680
I'm just a human!

1552
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,560
That's like the worst part.

1553
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:17,740
I'm not even like...

1554
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:21,920
It's not like I'm like a special god or anything.

1555
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:24,600
I'm literally just a regular guy.

1556
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:31,100
I'm literally just a regular guy.

1557
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:33,640
Trying with a bow.

1558
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,900
Like what the fuck am I supposed to do?

1559
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,480
Jesus Christ.

1560
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:42,940
Okay.

1561
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:44,680
We got bubbles now.

1562
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,740
Oh my god, but they got bubbles too.

1563
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:50,700
Oh no!

1564
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:51,460
Not the tsunami!

1565
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:53,960
Okay.

1566
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:55,520
Oh god.

1567
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:56,000
Okay.

1568
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:58,980
I'm on the afterimage!

1569
01:06:59,240 --> 01:06:59,500
Please!

1570
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:02,020
Why is nobody on it?

1571
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:09,380
Oh my god!

1572
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:13,900
Of course the healer I'm just gonna... This wasn't me.

1573
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:16,960
I did so much damage, man.

1574
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:19,400
There's no way.

1575
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:22,860
Like, like I literally...

1576
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:28,800
If you combine three of my teammates' damage I'm...

1577
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,760
Oh my god.

1578
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,400
I'm 12k!

1579
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:38,880
Like...

1580
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,460
All I did was just... I just shot!

1581
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:43,580
I just kept shooting!

1582
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,020
I kept shooting!

1583
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,280
It's not my fault.

1584
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:50,740
It's definitely not my fault.

1585
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:57,490
I actually tried so hard.

1586
01:07:58,210 --> 01:08:00,150
I tried so hard.

1587
01:08:00,270 --> 01:08:00,950
My team.

1588
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:02,210
I'm just...

1589
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:05,170
I'm just weighted down by my team.

1590
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:10,760
Spamming the tank.

1591
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:12,720
Shake my head.

1592
01:08:13,220 --> 01:08:16,400
I can't believe she said she's carry when all she did was spam.

1593
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:16,880
No!

1594
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:18,340
No, that is not true.

1595
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:20,140
That is not true.

1596
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:23,000
I did so much damage.

1597
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,360
Okay, Hela's been fun though.

1598
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:26,040
I like Hela.

1599
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:28,700
I think Hela's actually one of the strongest characters.

1600
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:29,560
Okay.

1601
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:31,740
Alright, we're gonna...

1602
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:34,040
Maybe I should do like...

1603
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:34,980
Maybe... I don't know.

1604
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:38,820
I'm trying to figure out what kind of crosshair I want to use.

1605
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:43,780
Maybe I'll do that and then we'll...

1606
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:45,420
Maybe I could do this.

1607
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:46,520
Okay, nope.

1608
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:51,640
Where is the outline, outline, center gap, crosshair angle?

1609
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:52,800
Where's the reticle?

1610
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:56,920
Uh...

1611
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:57,820
Where's the dot?

1612
01:08:57,820 --> 01:08:59,140
I'm trying to get rid of the dot.

1613
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:01,480
Details, dot.

1614
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:02,200
Okay, there you go.

1615
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,300
Maybe I'll try getting rid of the dot, maybe?

1616
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:10,100
I don't want to use the... Okay, circle and crosshair.

1617
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:11,400
Where the fuck?

1618
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:12,380
How do I get rid of the dot?

1619
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:14,080
Dot crosshair.

1620
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:16,200
Center gap, 26.

1621
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:17,000
Oh no.

1622
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:18,320
Oh no, please.

1623
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:19,520
I'm trying to get rid of the dot.

1624
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:20,000
No!

1625
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:22,640
Where's the dot?

1626
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:25,440
What?

1627
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:27,720
Oh my god, where is it?

1628
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:29,300
I want to get rid of the dot.

1629
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:29,940
I'm sorry.

1630
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:31,920
I'll be there soon.

1631
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:34,000
Reticle path.

1632
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:34,800
Oh, there you go.

1633
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:35,460
Dot, there you go.

1634
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:36,940
Okay, I'm sorry.

1635
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:39,280
I'm heading over.

1636
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:40,760
Oh wait, this is a new map.

1637
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:43,620
I'm so sorry.

1638
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:44,640
Oh, my teammates are dead.

1639
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,200
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1640
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:51,180
Okay, me dying should not mean like my entire team is just gone.

1641
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:52,620
Like, how?

1642
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:53,960
There's...

1643
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:55,700
Actually, how?

1644
01:09:56,280 --> 01:10:00,640
How did my entire team just die like that?

1645
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:06,100
Like, how did they all...

1646
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:08,320
I was not here for like one...

1647
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:09,540
Okay, maybe not one second.

1648
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,340
Maybe like six seconds.

1649
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:12,300
But still.

1650
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:14,600
Okay, I don't like this crosshair.

1651
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,180
This is way too like wide.

1652
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:18,600
So I'm gonna...

1653
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:19,120
Give me a swap.

1654
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:23,100
Oh, I feel like a gamer already where I'm just swapping crosshairs all the time.

1655
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,880
Yeah, this crosshair ain't it for me.

1656
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:30,900
I'm not a fan of this crosshair.

1657
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:33,580
Alright.

1658
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:34,900
Do we have healers?

1659
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:38,980
Why is our healer like in the fucking...

1660
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:39,640
Oh, my god.

1661
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:40,400
I can't see.

1662
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:41,220
I...

1663
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:44,000
I actually...

1664
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:45,640
It's too wide.

1665
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,920
I might need a dot crosshair.

1666
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:51,780
Oh, my god.

1667
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:53,380
I'm trying my best.

1668
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,900
I've been in 75 HP for the longest time.

1669
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:01,180
Oh, my god.

1670
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:02,360
This is what it's like to have a tank.

1671
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,560
I feel like I've never had a tank that actually like, you know...

1672
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:07,740
Tanks.

1673
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,780
I think it's because we actually don't have...

1674
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:10,400
No, we do.

1675
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:11,680
We have a DPS tank.

1676
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:13,240
That's why.

1677
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:14,780
That makes a lot more sense now.

1678
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:16,460
We have a DPS tank.

1679
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:21,660
Okay, yeah.

1680
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:22,840
I can tell why now.

1681
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:24,660
We actually have a DPS tank.

1682
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:25,880
Oh, yeah.

1683
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:29,580
I don't know.

1684
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:31,200
Okay.

1685
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:32,860
Shark, heal me!

1686
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:34,320
Shark!

1687
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:35,520
It's the only way!

1688
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:35,920
Shark!

1689
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:39,120
No!

1690
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:39,600
No!

1691
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:42,680
Alright, where's my reticle?

1692
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:44,940
Okay, definitely not this.

1693
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:46,200
Maybe I'll do the dot.

1694
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:46,860
Oh, no.

1695
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:47,860
Where did the dot go?

1696
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:50,960
Okay, dot and then...

1697
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:51,900
Maybe a bigger dot.

1698
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:52,620
There we go.

1699
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,440
I'm so sorry.

1700
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:05,840
I'm so sorry.

1701
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:08,020
I pressed the wrong button.

1702
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,180
I'm so sorry.

1703
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:15,480
It's all going wrong.

1704
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:21,720
Okay, to be fair, my support is just like DPSing this entire time.

1705
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:26,220
Like, I'm literally like trying to save my team.

1706
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:30,220
Yes, I accidentally pressed Q.

1707
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:34,800
Okay, nice.

1708
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:36,240
Oh my god, they're doing it.

1709
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,160
They're doing it.

1710
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:43,820
They're doing it!

1711
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:45,020
Sharkboy, please!

1712
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:46,880
You're literally our only healer!

1713
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,340
After you keep dying!

1714
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:52,160
You're literally our only healer!

1715
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:54,880
Oh my god!

1716
01:12:54,940 --> 01:12:56,300
Do I have to play support?

1717
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:04,840
Bro!

1718
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,160
When will I get a support?

1719
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:10,040
Bro!

1720
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:25,400
Guys!

1721
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:27,600
That shouldn't be a thing!

1722
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:35,560
The SBB was gone!

1723
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:38,520
I wasn't even playing the game!

1724
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:43,560
No, you don't understand!

1725
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:46,640
I wasn't even playing the game!

1726
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,220
I shouldn't be!

1727
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:49,740
The MVP!

1728
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:52,800
Okay.

1729
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:55,420
Maybe if I do this.

1730
01:13:57,260 --> 01:13:58,160
Okay, no.

1731
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:02,060
Okay, I'm trying to figure out my ideal.

1732
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:04,920
Okay, maybe I'll try this.

1733
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:05,660
Alright.

1734
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,140
Okay, if it's SBMM, I should like...

1735
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:15,660
If it's SBMM, I should get the benefit of that too.

1736
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:19,300
I shouldn't be the only one that knows how to play the video game.

1737
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:27,080
I don't understand!

1738
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:29,480
Alright.

1739
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:31,080
I guess I'll play a healer.

1740
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:32,400
I guess.

1741
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:36,820
I guess I'll play a healer, because no one else wants to heal.

1742
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:41,680
Alright.

1743
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:45,220
I guess I'll heal.

1744
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:48,020
We'll try Cloak and Dagger.

1745
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:50,820
God, this guy is...

1746
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:51,020
Okay.

1747
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,240
Jesus Christ, okay.

1748
01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:12,600
I'm trying to like remember how to play two characters at once.

1749
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:17,560
Okay.

1750
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:25,240
Deploy a Veil of Darkness, blinds, enshroud enemies, and grant them phase, making them...

1751
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:26,060
Oh, okay.

1752
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:27,420
Okay.

1753
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,400
Okay, alright.

1754
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:30,440
I'll figure it out.

1755
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:31,980
Okay, I'll do that.

1756
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:35,140
And then, this is damage.

1757
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:37,860
And then this is where I heal.

1758
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,880
Okay, and then this damages people.

1759
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:40,220
Okay.

1760
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,400
Oh, the cooldowns are different!

1761
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:43,560
Guys.

1762
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:45,440
That's actually crazy.

1763
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:46,920
The cooldowns are different.

1764
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:51,660
So like, if I use up all my cooldowns on Cloak, I get new cooldowns.

1765
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:54,360
Yeah.

1766
01:15:57,020 --> 01:15:58,120
I noticed it.

1767
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:04,760
Yeah, so like, if I use up all my cooldowns, I can like swap to the next one, and then it'll be a different cooldown.

1768
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:09,140
Swap!

1769
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:09,660
Heal!

1770
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:10,600
That's right.

1771
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,820
It's time to heal, guys.

1772
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:15,040
Okay.

1773
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:16,880
Okay, swap!

1774
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:20,400
Oh my god, this is dumb.

1775
01:16:24,370 --> 01:16:24,680
Okay.

1776
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:28,960
Oh my god, I have...

1777
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,320
It's a lot of thinking.

1778
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:31,300
That's for sure.

1779
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:33,960
It's...

1780
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:36,260
I'm like trying to think right now.

1781
01:16:40,370 --> 01:16:40,870
Oh!

1782
01:16:42,210 --> 01:16:42,710
Okay.

1783
01:16:44,630 --> 01:16:45,910
Okay, and then I just...

1784
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:47,330
I can literally just do like that.

1785
01:16:49,550 --> 01:16:50,050
Alright.

1786
01:16:50,450 --> 01:16:50,950
THINKING!

1787
01:16:52,450 --> 01:16:52,950
Okay.

1788
01:16:55,430 --> 01:16:56,430
And then...

1789
01:16:56,430 --> 01:16:56,910
Suck!

1790
01:16:57,430 --> 01:16:59,050
Oh my god, this is broken.

1791
01:16:59,170 --> 01:16:59,810
Because I can track.

1792
01:17:02,670 --> 01:17:03,950
Oh my god, should I have healed?

1793
01:17:04,130 --> 01:17:05,090
I'm so sorry!

1794
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,140
I'm sorry!

1795
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:11,420
I'm sorry!

1796
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:11,960
I'm getting overwhelmed!

1797
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:15,900
Oh my god!

1798
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:19,260
I need to remember my abilities!

1799
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:24,160
I get so overwhelmed because there's two characters!

1800
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:27,920
Okay.

1801
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:30,860
Okay, that's like a different move.

1802
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:31,560
Okay, there we go.

1803
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:37,000
Get over here!

1804
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:39,220
Oh my god, please heal!

1805
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:40,820
Get healed, please, please, please!

1806
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:43,900
Oh my god!

1807
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,120
Oh, I fucked up!

1808
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:53,540
Jesus Christ!

1809
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:55,620
There's too many abilities!

1810
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,000
I'm so overwhelmed!

1811
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:01,940
I'm just like, what do I do?

1812
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:03,500
What do I do?

1813
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:06,360
Okay.

1814
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:07,440
Okay.

1815
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:10,100
I don't have any abilities left, guys!

1816
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:12,700
I don't have any abilities left!

1817
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:15,980
Alright.

1818
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:21,920
Alright,

1819
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:25,740
heal!

1820
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:26,820
Heal!

1821
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:29,040
This is damage, this is heal!

1822
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:30,440
Remember this, Doki!

1823
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:30,760
Doki!

1824
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,140
Fight in the orb!

1825
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:36,620
Fight in the orb!

1826
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:40,420
We're invisible now!

1827
01:18:40,780 --> 01:18:42,340
Fight in the orb!

1828
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:44,240
Please, please!

1829
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:48,160
Please, how do you die so fast?

1830
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:50,200
I don't understand!

1831
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:58,000
I don't understand how we die so fast!

1832
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:03,600
I don't understand!

1833
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:08,980
Please, guys!

1834
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:14,800
I need you guys to be able to do stuff too!

1835
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:17,200
I can't outheal this damage!

1836
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:19,800
I can't heal!

1837
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:22,780
I know, wait.

1838
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:25,500
I know a character that can outheal.

1839
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:31,080
Like, I can't even damage!

1840
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:32,180
Because my team!

1841
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:34,680
My team dies so fast!

1842
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:38,940
The only healer that can outheal this.

1843
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:42,200
It's time to clap!

1844
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:47,580
This is literally the best support character.

1845
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:49,640
Okay, chef is out.

1846
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:50,680
Icedars.

1847
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:53,060
Clumptasty.

1848
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:54,280
The freeze.

1849
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:55,280
Okay, that freezes.

1850
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,600
This is literally like...

1851
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:02,540
This is like the biggest healing output character.

1852
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:03,320
I think.

1853
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:05,500
I think it's like her and shark.

1854
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:08,160
I haven't tried Loki yet.

1855
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:11,220
But it's clap to heal.

1856
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:13,420
It's when we start clapping, guys.

1857
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:16,280
We gotta give this flower to...

1858
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:20,180
Our flower to our tank.

1859
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:23,120
Yeah, I think shark also heals a lot.

1860
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,060
Because of his bubbles that he spits out.

1861
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:26,320
Because that heals too.

1862
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:30,180
So...

1863
01:20:30,180 --> 01:20:31,000
Clap!

1864
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:32,740
Okay.

1865
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:34,740
Okay, there we go.

1866
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:35,080
Clap.

1867
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:35,760
Clap.

1868
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:36,480
Clap.

1869
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:37,280
Clap.

1870
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:40,860
Please, I'm trying my best to clap as hard as I can.

1871
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:42,940
Please, I swear to god.

1872
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:44,780
Please!

1873
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:48,480
Please!

1874
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:49,140
Please, Venom!

1875
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,520
We're fucking clapping so hard!

1876
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:58,260
Oh my god, please!

1877
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:00,520
Oh, I'm too...

1878
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:02,360
What?!

1879
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:05,200
What is my team?!

1880
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:07,320
Oh my god!

1881
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:10,900
Guys...

1882
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:12,060
I think...

1883
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:13,820
We're burning three supports?

1884
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:15,260
What am I doing?

1885
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:16,220
I have ult!

1886
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:17,800
How do I have ult already?

1887
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,660
We did one fight!

1888
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:21,380
Okay, I'm gonna use my ult and then...

1889
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:22,560
I didn't have to be support.

1890
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:24,200
I could've actually played DPS.

1891
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:25,580
I didn't even realize.

1892
01:21:26,580 --> 01:21:28,820
I'm gonna do this and then start fucking ulting.

1893
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:29,840
This is it.

1894
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:30,660
We push in.

1895
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:31,980
We fucking push in.

1896
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:32,580
I'm dancing.

1897
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:33,980
I'm fucking dancing.

1898
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:34,820
We can't die.

1899
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:37,040
I literally have like...

1900
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:39,000
The ultimate heals right now.

1901
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:40,000
We can't die.

1902
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:42,280
Like...

1903
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:43,780
Nobody is supposed to die at this point.

1904
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:46,000
Like...

1905
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:48,040
I swear to god.

1906
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:50,380
I swear to god, guys.

1907
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:51,960
Oh my god!

1908
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,380
Do I have to do everything?

1909
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:56,940
Okay, here we go.

1910
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:58,140
Just keep healing.

1911
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:01,740
Oh no.

1912
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:03,380
Oh no.

1913
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,160
Get back over here.

1914
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,260
Oh, hit something!

1915
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:07,480
Hit something!

1916
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:09,400
Clap!

1917
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:09,800
Clap!

1918
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:12,580
Nice!

1919
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:14,660
I did so much damage there.

1920
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:17,260
Alright, I'm fucking swapping characters.

1921
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:17,660
Goodbye.

1922
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:21,360
I'm done playing support.

1923
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:25,540
Wait, where's the...

1924
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:26,880
Alright, I'm not throwing.

1925
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:28,520
I just don't want to play support anymore.

1926
01:22:29,180 --> 01:22:29,200
Alright.

1927
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:34,180
The tank, the DPS, and the healer.

1928
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:35,060
Alright.

1929
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:37,020
That's right.

1930
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:38,440
My team is starting to win.

1931
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:39,660
I swapped to Widowmaker.

1932
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:45,010
That's right.

1933
01:22:45,350 --> 01:22:46,290
I'm her.

1934
01:22:47,150 --> 01:22:48,590
I'm him now.

1935
01:22:49,310 --> 01:22:50,670
Team starts to win.

1936
01:22:50,970 --> 01:22:52,210
It's Widow time.

1937
01:22:54,070 --> 01:22:55,210
My team is losing.

1938
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:05,220
Guys, why?

1939
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,560
I literally...

1940
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:11,160
Really?

1941
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:18,200
What?

1942
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:23,770
How did... I swapped and he dies?

1943
01:23:24,170 --> 01:23:25,150
This is not fair.

1944
01:23:26,370 --> 01:23:28,030
This is not fair.

1945
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:29,970
We have two healers!

1946
01:23:31,850 --> 01:23:34,030
We literally have two healers!

1947
01:23:34,290 --> 01:23:37,450
I should be legally allowed to play this character.

1948
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:43,500
Here we go.

1949
01:23:46,820 --> 01:23:48,240
That's not fair!

1950
01:23:52,620 --> 01:23:54,980
Oh my god, are you serious?

1951
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:58,040
Oh my god, this is not fair.

1952
01:23:58,180 --> 01:23:59,700
I literally just got my ult.

1953
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:02,360
This is not fair.

1954
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:05,080
This is actually not fair.

1955
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:06,960
We have two supports!

1956
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:09,580
How was I supposed to know they couldn't do anything?

1957
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:16,740
Oh my god.

1958
01:24:16,780 --> 01:24:19,460
We need three healers to win.

1959
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:23,140
I just wanted to play DPS.

1960
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,260
Oh, I swear to god.

1961
01:24:27,340 --> 01:24:30,600
I swear to god, if I still have the most healing after everything I did.

1962
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,300
Like, after swapping the healer.

1963
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:36,940
I swear.

1964
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:37,920
I actually did.

1965
01:24:38,180 --> 01:24:39,880
I actually had the most...

1966
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:43,340
That's so sad.

1967
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,740
That's so fucking sad.

1968
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:48,140
I actually had the most healing.

1969
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:49,920
Oh my god.

1970
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:53,020
I stopped clapping and then they lost.

1971
01:24:54,860 --> 01:24:55,880
Guys, I...

1972
01:24:55,880 --> 01:25:03,460
You know, in SPMM, they're supposed to give me teammates that are also at my level.

1973
01:25:03,460 --> 01:25:04,220
But...

1974
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:07,360
Why am I carrying every game?

1975
01:25:09,620 --> 01:25:10,900
Why am I...

1976
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:13,460
Why am I carrying every game?

1977
01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:15,260
It doesn't make sense.

1978
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:16,680
Alright.

1979
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:19,360
Marvel Goats is calling Snooks.

1980
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:20,940
Thank you for the superchat.

1981
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:22,060
Thank you.

1982
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:24,040
Okay, let's see.

1983
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:25,460
I wanna try...

1984
01:25:26,220 --> 01:25:28,460
Guys, I just wanted to play Widowmaker.

1985
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:29,640
That's all I want.

1986
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:32,120
I just... Okay, so I'm not playing Widowmaker.

1987
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:33,540
They don't want me to...

1988
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:33,840
You know what?

1989
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:34,540
I'm playing Soldier.

1990
01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:37,080
I'm playing Soldier.

1991
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:43,160
That's it.

1992
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:43,700
I'm mad.

1993
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:46,080
I'm gonna play Soldier 76.

1994
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:50,060
Okay.

1995
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,260
Alright, I need to remember the abilities.

1996
01:25:53,600 --> 01:26:00,920
Okay, Unleash Gatling Gun, Shift, E that grounds and blocks damage from the front while dealing a smoke grenade.

1997
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:01,460
Okay.

1998
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:03,860
Shotgun.

1999
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:04,380
Okay.

2000
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:05,100
We're fine.

2001
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:08,500
Alright, nice.

2002
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:10,420
What's this?

2003
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:12,780
Okay.

2004
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:14,200
I just gotta figure this out.

2005
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:15,780
And this is Smoke Bomb.

2006
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:16,600
Alright.

2007
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:18,080
We're fine.

2008
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:22,540
I just can't run.

2009
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,780
So we're not as fine as I think we are.

2010
01:26:29,490 --> 01:26:30,170
Okay.

2011
01:26:30,830 --> 01:26:31,510
Weeee.

2012
01:26:32,290 --> 01:26:32,950
Okay.

2013
01:26:38,630 --> 01:26:39,990
Oh shit.

2014
01:26:41,070 --> 01:26:42,110
Heavy weapons time.

2015
01:26:43,190 --> 01:26:43,810
Go through.

2016
01:26:44,290 --> 01:26:45,390
Come on, you know you want to.

2017
01:26:47,490 --> 01:26:49,110
Come on, you know you want to.

2018
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:55,680
That's right.

2019
01:26:56,020 --> 01:26:57,140
Suppressing fire.

2020
01:27:01,010 --> 01:27:01,790
Suppressing fire.

2021
01:27:01,790 --> 01:27:02,390
Suppressing - Oh shit, okay.

2022
01:27:03,170 --> 01:27:04,130
It's a little awkward now.

2023
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:08,250
It's a little awkward here.

2024
01:27:09,170 --> 01:27:10,370
Guys, don't die, guys.

2025
01:27:12,970 --> 01:27:13,730
Oh god.

2026
01:27:14,670 --> 01:27:15,310
Oh god.

2027
01:27:20,010 --> 01:27:21,170
Oh thank god, he's healing.

2028
01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:22,070
He actually is healing me.

2029
01:27:22,910 --> 01:27:23,370
Don't worry.

2030
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:28,480
Oh my god.

2031
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:29,940
Oh no!

2032
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:31,460
He portal'd!

2033
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:35,860
They have actual healers!

2034
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:37,900
Oh my god!

2035
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:42,850
The melee healers!

2036
01:27:43,310 --> 01:27:47,150
Who would've thought?

2037
01:27:48,390 --> 01:27:50,170
They actually have healers, guys.

2038
01:27:50,370 --> 01:27:51,430
I don't know what that's like.

2039
01:27:53,370 --> 01:27:55,590
I don't know what that's like, guys.

2040
01:27:55,830 --> 01:27:57,410
I actually don't.

2041
01:27:59,410 --> 01:28:01,090
Oh yeah, you do!

2042
01:28:01,990 --> 01:28:02,030
Same.

2043
01:28:03,150 --> 01:28:03,530
Same.

2044
01:28:04,270 --> 01:28:09,010
I don't know what that's like.

2045
01:28:10,750 --> 01:28:11,470
Honestly.

2046
01:28:15,700 --> 01:28:17,300
Oh my god, please!

2047
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:18,480
Please!

2048
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:21,520
How do I find- I need healing.

2049
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:24,700
I need healing.

2050
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:27,740
Where is- I need healing.

2051
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:29,480
Okay, there we go.

2052
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:30,540
I need healing.

2053
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:34,400
Where is it?

2054
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:36,260
How do I- okay.

2055
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:38,560
God damn it.

2056
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:39,780
I need healing.

2057
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:44,340
Okay, we can't do that.

2058
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:45,220
God damn it.

2059
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:47,220
God damn it.

2060
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:54,900
I just need a typical Genji player as a QA.

2061
01:28:55,340 --> 01:28:56,620
As a support player?

2062
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:57,960
A bad support?

2063
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:02,500
A bad support actually fucking makes me angry.

2064
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:03,980
You guys don't understand.

2065
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:09,220
Like, when I have to deal with a bad support, it's like...

2066
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:10,400
Hahaha.

2067
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:14,520
Okay.

2068
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:22,140
It just like- it just gives me more- gives me more hate in my life.

2069
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:29,640
Oh my god, I will- I will ult this so that we can win.

2070
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:30,700
Like...

2071
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:31,220
Hahaha.

2072
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:35,220
I actually know how to aim, so...

2073
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:37,820
Okay.

2074
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:39,060
That's fine.

2075
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:40,920
Where does she portal to?

2076
01:29:43,740 --> 01:29:44,840
Oh no, please!

2077
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:45,240
No!

2078
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:47,520
Please.

2079
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:50,520
Guys, please.

2080
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:52,580
Just...

2081
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:55,200
Please, I just need a little heal.

2082
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:56,920
I just...

2083
01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:57,900
Just a little.

2084
01:29:58,100 --> 01:29:59,560
Oh, cause we have no tank.

2085
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:03,640
Are you- do I have to be a team player and play a tank too?

2086
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:04,680
Oh yeah!

2087
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:09,220
I can do that, but like, clearly you guys are fucking...

2088
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:11,360
No!

2089
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:12,780
Oh thank god!

2090
01:30:13,180 --> 01:30:17,800
Like, yeah I can be a tank but you guys gotta pick up the fucking slack!

2091
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:18,800
Okay.

2092
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:20,800
Alright.

2093
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:23,200
It's time to be a tank.

2094
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:25,000
Alright, what does Captain America does?

2095
01:30:25,140 --> 01:30:26,900
Okay, we'll figure it out while we play him.

2096
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:29,260
Hahaha, I don't know what he does.

2097
01:30:29,740 --> 01:30:33,000
But we'll- I have to play them all, apparently.

2098
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:36,020
Alright, this is his run.

2099
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,020
This is his run.

2100
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:40,160
Don't worry guys, a tank is here.

2101
01:30:44,260 --> 01:30:45,180
Don't worry.

2102
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:49,740
Don't worry.

2103
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:52,540
Bro!

2104
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:54,140
Guys, I'm your tank!

2105
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:54,760
Please!

2106
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:55,600
Hahaha!

2107
01:30:58,940 --> 01:30:59,600
Please!

2108
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:01,940
I'm literally your tank!

2109
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:04,020
Please!

2110
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:05,640
I'm fucking shielding this!

2111
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:07,360
Guys!

2112
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:11,560
Please!

2113
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:15,360
Please!

2114
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:16,820
I can't aim!

2115
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:21,560
All I can do is melee, I swear to god!

2116
01:31:22,140 --> 01:31:23,920
Literally, that's all I can do!

2117
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:25,660
I can just melee!

2118
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:28,260
Please protect your only tank!

2119
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:29,120
Hahaha!

2120
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:32,700
I swear!

2121
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:34,760
Please!

2122
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:38,040
Just all you need to do is heal me!

2123
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:40,320
I'm your only tank!

2124
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:43,220
Oh my god!

2125
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:44,500
There has to be somebody!

2126
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:45,280
Okay.

2127
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:50,400
Oh my god!

2128
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:52,020
I can't!

2129
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:55,760
How do I keep getting the worst teammates in my fucking life?

2130
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:56,380
Hahaha!

2131
01:31:57,940 --> 01:31:59,900
I don't understand!

2132
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:10,580
I don't understand, guys.

2133
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:17,460
Oh my god!

2134
01:32:19,580 --> 01:32:20,800
You're right.

2135
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:22,400
I should just play Wolverine.

2136
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:23,780
Yeah, but you can't aim!

2137
01:32:24,220 --> 01:32:25,820
Like, I don't...

2138
01:32:25,820 --> 01:32:27,480
I don't understand!

2139
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:28,880
Hahaha!

2140
01:32:31,540 --> 01:32:32,600
I played support!

2141
01:32:33,140 --> 01:32:35,560
I played tank!

2142
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:37,920
I played DPS!

2143
01:32:38,780 --> 01:32:40,220
I did it all!

2144
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:42,320
I fucking did it all!

2145
01:32:44,620 --> 01:32:45,120
Hahaha!

2146
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:48,040
Oh my god!

2147
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:51,520
That means I got all six of my kills!

2148
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:52,860
Okay.

2149
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:54,840
That's okay, I'm calm.

2150
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:56,820
I'm calm now.

2151
01:33:00,370 --> 01:33:01,610
I'm calm now.

2152
01:33:01,610 --> 01:33:02,290
I forgot.

2153
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:05,470
I forgot how tilted I could get.

2154
01:33:05,610 --> 01:33:06,090
Hahaha!

2155
01:33:08,030 --> 01:33:08,830
Fine!

2156
01:33:11,610 --> 01:33:12,910
Fine, I'll heal!

2157
01:33:13,570 --> 01:33:14,250
Fine!

2158
01:33:14,390 --> 01:33:15,490
I'll fucking heal!

2159
01:33:16,370 --> 01:33:17,550
I don't...

2160
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:18,090
Fine!

2161
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:21,050
Fine!

2162
01:33:21,890 --> 01:33:23,790
I'll be the healer, bitch!

2163
01:33:24,190 --> 01:33:25,530
I'll fucking... I'll do it!

2164
01:33:25,730 --> 01:33:27,350
I'll fucking do it!

2165
01:33:28,430 --> 01:33:29,230
Alright.

2166
01:33:38,350 --> 01:33:39,410
Oh my god, please.

2167
01:33:39,490 --> 01:33:40,390
I forgot what he does.

2168
01:33:40,710 --> 01:33:41,190
I...

2169
01:33:42,150 --> 01:33:44,230
Fine, I'll do it myself.

2170
01:33:45,490 --> 01:33:47,010
I'm the only healer!

2171
01:33:47,610 --> 01:33:48,490
I mean...

2172
01:33:48,490 --> 01:33:50,170
I'm still the only healer!

2173
01:33:50,630 --> 01:33:52,430
Nobody else wants to heal!

2174
01:33:53,210 --> 01:33:53,550
Okay.

2175
01:33:53,810 --> 01:33:54,550
It's okay, I'm calm.

2176
01:33:55,530 --> 01:33:56,010
Um...

2177
01:33:56,010 --> 01:33:58,670
Gather quantum energy and collision and swiftly launch it at enemies.

2178
01:33:58,750 --> 01:34:02,150
Target an enemy for bouncing, which also heals himself, upon healing.

2179
01:34:02,610 --> 01:34:03,770
Self-targets if... Okay.

2180
01:34:04,330 --> 01:34:05,650
Alright, we got this.

2181
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:06,950
It's friendship bracelet.

2182
01:34:07,070 --> 01:34:07,790
I remember now.

2183
01:34:08,270 --> 01:34:08,670
Alright.

2184
01:34:09,550 --> 01:34:10,550
It's fine.

2185
01:34:10,890 --> 01:34:11,330
I'm okay.

2186
01:34:11,390 --> 01:34:12,350
I'm fucking fine.

2187
01:34:14,270 --> 01:34:14,610
Okay.

2188
01:34:14,890 --> 01:34:15,370
What is it?

2189
01:34:16,030 --> 01:34:16,730
Friendship bracelet.

2190
01:34:16,870 --> 01:34:17,110
Okay.

2191
01:34:17,650 --> 01:34:19,130
Now we're all friends.

2192
01:34:19,850 --> 01:34:20,490
Hahaha!

2193
01:34:21,310 --> 01:34:23,210
We're all friends now.

2194
01:34:23,990 --> 01:34:25,090
It snapped to heal.

2195
01:34:25,430 --> 01:34:26,410
I remember now.

2196
01:34:27,430 --> 01:34:29,130
We just gotta keep snapping.

2197
01:34:31,950 --> 01:34:33,470
I'll just keep snapping.

2198
01:34:34,170 --> 01:34:36,370
If you die, it's because you're fucking stupid, not me.

2199
01:34:37,070 --> 01:34:39,090
I'm literally... I literally have to do this myself.

2200
01:34:48,430 --> 01:34:49,570
That's fucking right.

2201
01:34:49,890 --> 01:34:50,190
Hahaha!

2202
01:34:51,170 --> 01:34:51,770
Snap!

2203
01:34:55,410 --> 01:34:56,010
Snap!

2204
01:34:57,110 --> 01:34:58,130
That's fucking right!

2205
01:34:59,670 --> 01:35:01,410
I shall keep snapping!

2206
01:35:01,410 --> 01:35:03,050
I shall keep snapping!

2207
01:35:04,350 --> 01:35:05,910
Let us all heal now.

2208
01:35:07,330 --> 01:35:07,830
Alright.

2209
01:35:08,610 --> 01:35:09,570
Thank God.

2210
01:35:10,570 --> 01:35:12,090
Yeah, but it's not the same.

2211
01:35:12,470 --> 01:35:14,050
I just wanna shoot things.

2212
01:35:15,030 --> 01:35:16,370
We just have to do this.

2213
01:35:16,650 --> 01:35:16,990
Snap!

2214
01:35:20,750 --> 01:35:21,510
Don't worry.

2215
01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:22,130
Snap!

2216
01:35:25,110 --> 01:35:25,910
Oh yeah?

2217
01:35:25,990 --> 01:35:26,690
You don't want healing?

2218
01:35:26,790 --> 01:35:28,130
I'm literally your only healer.

2219
01:35:28,770 --> 01:35:30,070
Oh my God, please.

2220
01:35:32,470 --> 01:35:33,750
I'm sorry, but...

2221
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:35,630
I have to reload.

2222
01:35:36,310 --> 01:35:36,650
Snap!

2223
01:35:40,070 --> 01:35:41,010
Keep snapping!

2224
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:45,760
Oh, he's so low though.

2225
01:35:46,180 --> 01:35:47,540
Please, he's so low!

2226
01:35:50,380 --> 01:35:52,120
Alright, this should be able to hit him.

2227
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:55,900
Oh my God, I swear to God.

2228
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:57,380
I swear... Get over here!

2229
01:35:57,380 --> 01:35:58,020
Snap!

2230
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:02,220
I swear to God, please.

2231
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:03,960
Alright.

2232
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:08,060
Okay, that's good.

2233
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:10,420
All he's doing is just pushing for no reason.

2234
01:36:13,460 --> 01:36:13,940
Snap!

2235
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:17,300
Alright.

2236
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:19,940
Oh my God, this is so easy.

2237
01:36:20,140 --> 01:36:21,420
God, I'm a fucking natural.

2238
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:24,340
But fuck me for wanting to play...

2239
01:36:24,340 --> 01:36:26,580
For wanting to be a DPS player for once in my life.

2240
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:27,320
Yeah.

2241
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:31,780
Yeah.

2242
01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:35,480
How dare I want to be a fucking DPS player.

2243
01:36:36,660 --> 01:36:40,040
How dare I not want to be a goddamn babysitter for once.

2244
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:42,840
Like...

2245
01:36:43,980 --> 01:36:44,980
I'm literally...

2246
01:36:44,980 --> 01:36:47,080
I'm literally solo healing.

2247
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:49,780
Oh my God, that's so cute.

2248
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:51,240
Wait, there's a tiger there.

2249
01:36:52,820 --> 01:36:53,900
There you go.

2250
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:54,860
Let's all have friendship.

2251
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:56,260
We're all soul bonded now.

2252
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:58,820
You know what, fuck this.

2253
01:36:59,380 --> 01:37:00,580
If we die, we die.

2254
01:37:00,940 --> 01:37:01,360
There you go.

2255
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:04,300
Oh my God, I fucking got swallowed.

2256
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:05,480
No!

2257
01:37:06,580 --> 01:37:08,040
Get me out of here!

2258
01:37:11,310 --> 01:37:12,310
It's okay, so bye!

2259
01:37:15,370 --> 01:37:16,910
Guys, I'm your only support!

2260
01:37:17,570 --> 01:37:18,210
That's fine.

2261
01:37:19,290 --> 01:37:20,150
That's fine.

2262
01:37:22,070 --> 01:37:23,010
That's fine.

2263
01:37:23,470 --> 01:37:24,070
That's fine.

2264
01:37:24,070 --> 01:37:25,470
I'm your only support, guys.

2265
01:37:25,550 --> 01:37:26,430
But that's okay.

2266
01:37:30,330 --> 01:37:31,370
That's okay!

2267
01:37:35,490 --> 01:37:37,230
It's okay, I am Groot!

2268
01:37:37,290 --> 01:37:38,050
Yes, we know!

2269
01:37:38,450 --> 01:37:39,150
So fun!

2270
01:37:41,310 --> 01:37:43,250
Oh no, not the eye.

2271
01:37:43,710 --> 01:37:44,210
That's fine.

2272
01:37:46,090 --> 01:37:46,690
Snap!

2273
01:37:50,910 --> 01:37:51,670
Guys...

2274
01:37:54,730 --> 01:37:56,110
I'm still snapping.

2275
01:37:56,570 --> 01:37:57,410
But like...

2276
01:37:59,810 --> 01:38:02,690
I need you guys to start killing people.

2277
01:38:03,010 --> 01:38:05,310
Because I'm the only support, guys!

2278
01:38:07,930 --> 01:38:09,170
Groot, please!

2279
01:38:09,850 --> 01:38:10,610
Guys!

2280
01:38:12,150 --> 01:38:12,830
Damn!

2281
01:38:16,150 --> 01:38:18,270
It's only me and Groot, man.

2282
01:38:18,270 --> 01:38:21,990
It's really only me and Groot.

2283
01:38:23,530 --> 01:38:26,570
Me and Groot versus the fucking world.

2284
01:38:27,010 --> 01:38:28,330
Wait, this is it.

2285
01:38:28,450 --> 01:38:30,350
This might be the one time.

2286
01:38:31,610 --> 01:38:34,090
Well, I guess he's dead.

2287
01:38:36,010 --> 01:38:37,590
Well, I guess he's dead too.

2288
01:38:39,790 --> 01:38:41,910
What the fuck was he doing here?

2289
01:38:44,950 --> 01:38:46,110
Okay, heal!

2290
01:38:48,270 --> 01:38:49,670
I'm sorry, Groot!

2291
01:38:50,510 --> 01:38:51,930
Oh, I'm so sorry!

2292
01:38:52,050 --> 01:38:52,990
There was no way!

2293
01:38:53,870 --> 01:38:55,690
There was no fucking way!

2294
01:38:56,130 --> 01:38:57,650
There was four people!

2295
01:38:58,750 --> 01:39:00,890
I keep thinking my left click can heal.

2296
01:39:01,250 --> 01:39:02,570
But it's literally just damage.

2297
01:39:04,010 --> 01:39:05,430
Like, I keep forgetting that.

2298
01:39:07,910 --> 01:39:08,910
Alright, go in!

2299
01:39:09,050 --> 01:39:09,490
Go in!

2300
01:39:10,330 --> 01:39:11,170
This is it!

2301
01:39:12,930 --> 01:39:13,850
Go in!

2302
01:39:18,630 --> 01:39:19,610
Okay, that's fine.

2303
01:39:19,710 --> 01:39:20,130
That's fine.

2304
01:39:20,730 --> 01:39:21,390
I need to remember.

2305
01:39:22,150 --> 01:39:24,050
Left click is literally just DPS.

2306
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:27,090
Alright, I'm gonna get out of here now.

2307
01:39:29,670 --> 01:39:30,630
Alright, goodbye!

2308
01:39:34,740 --> 01:39:35,560
Oh, no.

2309
01:39:36,940 --> 01:39:37,920
Oh, please!

2310
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:39,100
I can't!

2311
01:39:43,900 --> 01:39:44,200
Please!

2312
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:49,080
Groot, no!

2313
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:53,520
Snap!

2314
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:53,760
Snap!

2315
01:39:58,300 --> 01:39:58,860
Snap!

2316
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:01,840
Oh my god!

2317
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:02,460
Finally!

2318
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:06,000
The ult is a mercy rez.

2319
01:40:06,220 --> 01:40:07,100
That's what it is.

2320
01:40:09,860 --> 01:40:11,340
Oh my god, thank god!

2321
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:12,020
We did it!

2322
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:14,020
We won our first game!

2323
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:16,180
That's our second game!

2324
01:40:19,140 --> 01:40:21,220
That's the solo healer!

2325
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:24,500
To be fair, Groot was actually really good.

2326
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:25,840
That guy was insane.

2327
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:35,780
I just gotta be a god damn heal bot.

2328
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:43,100
It's gotta be a heal bot.

2329
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:45,620
The only fucking heal bot in this team.

2330
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:49,820
The only team, guys, that actually cares.

2331
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:51,320
In a quick play lobby.

2332
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:54,880
Decent teammates?

2333
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:56,480
No, it was literally Groot.

2334
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:58,600
It was...

2335
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:01,540
Groot fucking solo hand carried this.

2336
01:41:03,700 --> 01:41:05,480
Oh my god.

2337
01:41:06,020 --> 01:41:06,580
Alright.

2338
01:41:07,940 --> 01:41:09,780
Guys, can I finally play DPS?

2339
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:10,620
Let's find out.

2340
01:41:10,820 --> 01:41:12,120
Let's find out, guys.

2341
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,740
Oh, that's a support?

2342
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:16,820
That's a support?

2343
01:41:17,220 --> 01:41:18,000
Does this mean...

2344
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,080
Oh, Sir Roland!

2345
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:22,960
Sir Roland, you know what would be great for the team?

2346
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:24,780
If, you know...

2347
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:26,340
Sir Roland!

2348
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:28,760
Oh, DPS?

2349
01:41:29,180 --> 01:41:30,440
Yeah, that.

2350
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:32,340
Yeah, sure.

2351
01:41:32,740 --> 01:41:33,320
Sure.

2352
01:41:36,780 --> 01:41:38,860
Yeah, 100% this game needs roll queue.

2353
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:44,160
Guys.

2354
01:41:45,580 --> 01:41:48,260
Wouldn't it be great if we have...

2355
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:50,600
a second support?

2356
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:52,320
That would be...

2357
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:58,060
Guys, I heard this new concept where people would play two supports, two tanks.

2358
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:00,120
We don't even need two tanks.

2359
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:03,660
People would just play two supports.

2360
01:42:03,820 --> 01:42:05,040
It's a wild concept.

2361
01:42:05,180 --> 01:42:06,840
I just recently heard about it too.

2362
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:14,980
I heard it was one of the ways to win video games.

2363
01:42:15,060 --> 01:42:16,340
Having two healers.

2364
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:19,940
It's like an actual real life cheat.

2365
01:42:20,380 --> 01:42:22,980
The devs can't do anything about it.

2366
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:24,720
The devs can't ban it or anything.

2367
01:42:24,860 --> 01:42:25,520
I fucked up.

2368
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:27,560
Whoops.

2369
01:42:32,340 --> 01:42:32,840
Whoops.

2370
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:37,500
I fucked up a little bit.

2371
01:42:46,140 --> 01:42:46,700
Okay.

2372
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:48,420
Come on!

2373
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:50,460
No!

2374
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:55,260
Oh my god, please.

2375
01:43:02,100 --> 01:43:04,280
Oh my god, please!

2376
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:07,300
I did like damage, but like I...

2377
01:43:07,660 --> 01:43:12,120
I did so much...

2378
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:15,080
No, I did so much damage, but like...

2379
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:16,860
Oh my god, we have two healers!

2380
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:18,660
Oh my god, it worked!

2381
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:20,460
It worked, guys!

2382
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:22,340
We actually have two healers!

2383
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:23,940
Holy shit!

2384
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:25,460
Who would've thought?

2385
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:27,020
They actually...

2386
01:43:27,020 --> 01:43:27,960
They know the strats.

2387
01:43:28,540 --> 01:43:29,940
They know the legal strats.

2388
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:33,020
Oh my god, that's actually crazy.

2389
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:37,420
That's actually crazy that they know the practice.

2390
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:39,240
It's like it's almost cheating.

2391
01:43:40,540 --> 01:43:42,160
It might as well be cheating.

2392
01:43:42,580 --> 01:43:43,600
My god.

2393
01:43:43,900 --> 01:43:45,900
I wonder what it's like to have healers.

2394
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:50,840
I wonder.

2395
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:53,340
I wonder what it's like.

2396
01:43:53,340 --> 01:43:53,360
Oh my god.

2397
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:03,600
Jesus Christ.

2398
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:04,720
Okay.

2399
01:44:07,660 --> 01:44:08,080
Oh.

2400
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:10,160
I learned.

2401
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:12,240
Guys, I figured out what that actually...

2402
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:13,620
how to use that now.

2403
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:18,600
I fucked it up.

2404
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:20,720
I actually fucked that up.

2405
01:44:21,260 --> 01:44:21,900
That's crazy.

2406
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:21,940
That's crazy.

2407
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:26,640
I forgot to hit the ground.

2408
01:44:27,820 --> 01:44:34,220
I don't know if you know this, but when you have your ult, you have to hit the fucking floor with it.

2409
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:37,800
I did not hit the floor.

2410
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:46,140
Okay.

2411
01:44:48,740 --> 01:44:50,580
Okay, this is not fair!

2412
01:44:51,220 --> 01:44:53,180
They actually get kills!

2413
01:44:57,540 --> 01:44:58,700
Oh my god.

2414
01:44:59,060 --> 01:45:00,520
Like he's getting healed!

2415
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:07,240
What do I do when they get fucking healed?!

2416
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:11,500
Like what?!

2417
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:13,100
Oh my god!

2418
01:45:13,540 --> 01:45:14,740
I would get him one!

2419
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:19,720
Okay, there we go.

2420
01:45:19,740 --> 01:45:20,280
We did it.

2421
01:45:22,660 --> 01:45:23,780
Oh my god.

2422
01:45:23,980 --> 01:45:27,880
I can actually kill people when they stop getting healed.

2423
01:45:27,880 --> 01:45:29,880
Who would have thought?!

2424
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:35,660
What a fucking insane concept!

2425
01:45:37,940 --> 01:45:38,740
Insane!

2426
01:45:39,140 --> 01:45:40,960
Fucking concept chat!

2427
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:47,380
I can actually do things in this lobby.

2428
01:45:53,180 --> 01:45:56,060
Oh my god, the fucking Hulk is actually blocking me.

2429
01:45:58,300 --> 01:46:00,520
Like, I can't even get him out of mech.

2430
01:46:00,820 --> 01:46:07,320
I think this is where I die.

2431
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:10,520
I think this is where I die, guys.

2432
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:16,460
Guys, I can't get out of here!

2433
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:21,140
Please!

2434
01:46:22,780 --> 01:46:23,280
Damn!

2435
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:23,780
Please!

2436
01:46:23,780 --> 01:46:24,020
Please!

2437
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:29,360
I don't know!

2438
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:30,200
I don't make it!

2439
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:32,460
I've tried so hard!

2440
01:46:36,980 --> 01:46:38,980
But like, it's actually crazy.

2441
01:46:40,020 --> 01:46:43,160
They have this thing called healers and like, I don't know what to do.

2442
01:46:44,180 --> 01:46:46,420
Like, I don't know what to do.

2443
01:46:46,420 --> 01:46:47,480
Like...

2444
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:55,740
I don't know what to do when they have supports.

2445
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:01,920
Please!

2446
01:47:02,340 --> 01:47:02,680
Please!

2447
01:47:06,280 --> 01:47:07,740
I'll fucking beat you up!

2448
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,600
I don't care!

2449
01:47:11,580 --> 01:47:12,860
Oh my god, please.

2450
01:47:12,980 --> 01:47:14,560
I need just one little heal.

2451
01:47:14,860 --> 01:47:15,460
Please!

2452
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:16,640
I just...

2453
01:47:22,860 --> 01:47:23,940
I can't!

2454
01:47:24,300 --> 01:47:25,120
I can't!

2455
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:25,400
I can't!

2456
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:27,420
We only have one support again, guys!

2457
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:29,400
We only have one support!

2458
01:47:32,660 --> 01:47:35,200
I think our team is actually...

2459
01:47:36,780 --> 01:47:37,680
Oh my god.

2460
01:47:38,740 --> 01:47:42,240
I think our team is actually allergic to healers.

2461
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:51,380
Why can't I have that?

2462
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:52,560
Did you see that?

2463
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:54,180
Her HP just comes back!

2464
01:47:58,820 --> 01:48:01,160
Her HP comes back!

2465
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:09,260
I don't know what that's like!

2466
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:11,000
I don't know!

2467
01:48:11,900 --> 01:48:13,480
What is that like?

2468
01:48:14,980 --> 01:48:17,560
Somebody please enlighten me!

2469
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:22,200
Okay.

2470
01:48:22,740 --> 01:48:23,520
How do I use this?

2471
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:26,920
How do I use this?

2472
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:27,600
Oh!

2473
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:31,220
That's how.

2474
01:48:33,220 --> 01:48:34,180
This is fine.

2475
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:36,060
This is fucking fine.

2476
01:48:37,060 --> 01:48:38,740
I was trying to figure out how to use that ult.

2477
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:40,660
Get him out of mech.

2478
01:48:40,780 --> 01:48:42,700
Just get him out of mech.

2479
01:48:46,470 --> 01:48:47,470
Oh my god.

2480
01:48:47,470 --> 01:48:49,170
Oh, thank god.

2481
01:48:49,270 --> 01:48:50,610
Thank god, team.

2482
01:48:51,050 --> 01:48:52,850
I'm so happy for you.

2483
01:48:53,330 --> 01:48:58,210
That looks like a lot of people that might die.

2484
01:48:59,510 --> 01:49:00,270
What?

2485
01:49:01,090 --> 01:49:01,830
What?

2486
01:49:02,290 --> 01:49:04,330
He flew over me?

2487
01:49:06,450 --> 01:49:07,330
Did he actually?

2488
01:49:08,150 --> 01:49:08,470
What?

2489
01:49:10,010 --> 01:49:13,350
I didn't realize he flew over me.

2490
01:49:14,650 --> 01:49:15,590
Oh my god.

2491
01:49:15,830 --> 01:49:18,190
Wait, my team's actually trying again.

2492
01:49:18,970 --> 01:49:20,570
I'm so proud of them.

2493
01:49:21,150 --> 01:49:23,070
I'm actually so happy.

2494
01:49:24,790 --> 01:49:29,050
Guys, I don't know if you guys know this, but he's up here.

2495
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:38,900
What is that like?

2496
01:49:39,020 --> 01:49:40,400
What is that like to be fully healed?

2497
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:40,820
JK.

2498
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:41,720
Get fucked.

2499
01:49:44,420 --> 01:49:44,940
JK.

2500
01:49:46,060 --> 01:49:47,080
Get shit on.

2501
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:47,980
I'm a better sniper.

2502
01:49:49,020 --> 01:49:50,320
But I need medkits.

2503
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:53,680
I need medkits.

2504
01:49:56,140 --> 01:49:57,520
What is that like?

2505
01:49:57,780 --> 01:50:01,340
I don't know what that's like, having actual supports.

2506
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:05,720
Oh, come on.

2507
01:50:05,820 --> 01:50:07,200
That should've been a kill.

2508
01:50:11,500 --> 01:50:13,920
Oh no, I'm scared for my team.

2509
01:50:15,180 --> 01:50:15,900
Oh no.

2510
01:50:16,820 --> 01:50:17,540
Oh no.

2511
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:18,640
Wait, they're winning.

2512
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:19,560
They're winning this.

2513
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:21,640
I believe.

2514
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:25,960
I believe.

2515
01:50:33,260 --> 01:50:34,000
Oh god.

2516
01:50:34,120 --> 01:50:35,040
Okay, I stopped believing.

2517
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:36,460
I stopped believing.

2518
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:39,280
Guys, guys, I'm backing out.

2519
01:50:39,900 --> 01:50:40,260
Thank you.

2520
01:50:40,580 --> 01:50:40,980
Clap, clap.

2521
01:50:41,060 --> 01:50:41,540
Keep clapping.

2522
01:50:46,130 --> 01:50:47,950
Okay, I'm gonna save my ult for the last fight.

2523
01:50:52,610 --> 01:50:53,950
Keep backing out.

2524
01:50:58,510 --> 01:50:59,930
Oh god, I missed the jump.

2525
01:51:00,070 --> 01:51:00,310
No.

2526
01:51:02,510 --> 01:51:03,450
Just keep backing out.

2527
01:51:03,530 --> 01:51:04,630
We can do this, guys.

2528
01:51:04,810 --> 01:51:05,650
I have ult.

2529
01:51:06,210 --> 01:51:06,790
Oh my god.

2530
01:51:06,870 --> 01:51:08,850
There we

2531
01:51:13,870 --> 01:51:15,550
go.

2532
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:20,590
Oh my god.

2533
01:51:20,670 --> 01:51:22,770
Oh, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

2534
01:51:27,260 --> 01:51:28,160
Oh, come on.

2535
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:28,920
She's so low.

2536
01:51:29,380 --> 01:51:30,220
She's so low.

2537
01:51:32,660 --> 01:51:33,900
I have melee.

2538
01:51:38,940 --> 01:51:40,220
Oh, this is stupid.

2539
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:42,700
Oh, I'm fucking running.

2540
01:51:43,180 --> 01:51:43,260
Clap.

2541
01:51:53,970 --> 01:51:54,850
Just keep clapping.

2542
01:51:59,220 --> 01:52:00,760
Oh god, just keep clapping.

2543
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:07,160
Oh my god, please.

2544
01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:11,140
Please, just keep clapping.

2545
01:52:29,580 --> 01:52:30,220
I

2546
01:52:47,140 --> 01:52:47,780
do.

2547
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:52,960
Oh my god.

2548
01:52:55,440 --> 01:53:00,580
Oh my god.

2549
01:53:01,380 --> 01:53:03,040
Bro, I can't.

2550
01:53:03,240 --> 01:53:05,200
How could a clapping fail?

2551
01:53:06,620 --> 01:53:08,940
How did clapping fail?

2552
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:13,640
I don't understand.

2553
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:16,120
We should have clapped harder.

2554
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:20,240
Did you not...

2555
01:53:20,240 --> 01:53:22,880
Did she not clap hard enough for me?

2556
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:28,540
I was...

2557
01:53:29,240 --> 01:53:31,300
I was better than the enemy Widow.

2558
01:53:31,500 --> 01:53:35,780
The enemy Widow kept getting pocketed so fucking hard.

2559
01:53:35,940 --> 01:53:36,920
It was bullshit.

2560
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:40,100
Every time I shot her, she just gets healed up.

2561
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:43,320
And then I have to go downstairs to a heal pack.

2562
01:53:43,620 --> 01:53:45,500
Like, what the fuck is this bullshit?

2563
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:47,620
Like, actually...

2564
01:53:47,620 --> 01:53:49,880
I can't have a fucking...

2565
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:51,320
Okay, I'm calm.

2566
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:52,040
I'm calm.

2567
01:53:52,480 --> 01:53:54,420
I'm so fucking calm.

2568
01:53:55,720 --> 01:53:56,520
Okay, stealth mode.

2569
01:53:56,640 --> 01:53:59,040
Dash forward and slice through enemies along the path with...

2570
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:00,140
Wait, I'll try this out.

2571
01:54:05,810 --> 01:54:07,570
If you see...

2572
01:54:07,570 --> 01:54:11,490
I take a shot and then she's back to full health.

2573
01:54:13,250 --> 01:54:14,090
I'm calm.

2574
01:54:14,090 --> 01:54:15,590
Okay, let's see.

2575
01:54:15,710 --> 01:54:17,150
What is this ability?

2576
01:54:18,630 --> 01:54:18,990
Okay.

2577
01:54:20,430 --> 01:54:21,550
How do I do this?

2578
01:54:23,230 --> 01:54:23,750
Okay.

2579
01:54:24,450 --> 01:54:27,250
And there's this movement boost and then dash.

2580
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:33,680
Oh, I can pull it back!

2581
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:34,400
I see.

2582
01:54:35,160 --> 01:54:35,520
Okay.

2583
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:37,920
It's Genji time.

2584
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:40,820
Alright, this is a projectile I'm pretty sure.

2585
01:54:40,820 --> 01:54:40,940
Okay.

2586
01:54:43,240 --> 01:54:44,300
Imma get... yeah.

2587
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:45,800
Alright, let's see how this goes.

2588
01:54:45,900 --> 01:54:47,000
Oh, that's so cute!

2589
01:54:47,540 --> 01:54:48,960
It's like a plushy Incredible Hulk.

2590
01:54:49,940 --> 01:54:51,320
Okay, let's see how this goes.

2591
01:54:51,460 --> 01:54:51,960
I don't know.

2592
01:54:56,930 --> 01:54:57,750
Oh my god.

2593
01:54:59,710 --> 01:55:00,570
Oh my god!

2594
01:55:00,670 --> 01:55:01,590
I pressed shift!

2595
01:55:02,030 --> 01:55:04,470
For some reason, I thought shift was run...

2596
01:55:04,470 --> 01:55:04,970
I don't know.

2597
01:55:05,390 --> 01:55:06,730
There's so many heroes.

2598
01:55:09,450 --> 01:55:11,110
My memory is like...

2599
01:55:11,110 --> 01:55:11,750
Fucking up.

2600
01:55:12,870 --> 01:55:13,150
Whoops!

2601
01:55:14,950 --> 01:55:16,330
I actually dashed right into them.

2602
01:55:17,890 --> 01:55:18,490
Oh my god.

2603
01:55:18,610 --> 01:55:19,170
He can heal.

2604
01:55:19,610 --> 01:55:20,390
Can he sing too?

2605
01:55:21,510 --> 01:55:22,770
Yeah, my muscle memory...

2606
01:55:22,770 --> 01:55:27,190
Because every time I see shift, I feel like it's not like attack.

2607
01:55:27,430 --> 01:55:29,470
It's not like shift into them.

2608
01:55:29,770 --> 01:55:31,090
But it's like Genji.

2609
01:55:32,150 --> 01:55:35,350
Because I play a lot of support so for me...

2610
01:55:35,350 --> 01:55:36,290
Like right now.

2611
01:55:38,310 --> 01:55:39,490
Like right now.

2612
01:55:41,110 --> 01:55:45,370
I don't play Genji so my muscle memory for shift is mostly used for like...

2613
01:55:45,830 --> 01:55:47,430
Not these types of abilities.

2614
01:55:52,170 --> 01:55:53,750
Oh my god, he's so low.

2615
01:55:54,910 --> 01:55:55,850
That's the worst part.

2616
01:55:58,050 --> 01:55:58,850
Can you remember?

2617
01:56:03,470 --> 01:56:04,370
Oh my god.

2618
01:56:04,390 --> 01:56:06,250
Can you remember not to...

2619
01:56:10,150 --> 01:56:10,750
Really?

2620
01:56:11,110 --> 01:56:11,650
I'm...

2621
01:56:11,650 --> 01:56:12,030
Okay!

2622
01:56:12,030 --> 01:56:12,090
Yay!

2623
01:56:13,730 --> 01:56:14,870
Oh, thank you.

2624
01:56:17,970 --> 01:56:18,970
Oh, please.

2625
01:56:20,090 --> 01:56:20,910
Thank you.

2626
01:56:23,730 --> 01:56:25,870
Oh, this is so team reliant though.

2627
01:56:31,250 --> 01:56:32,310
Oh, where's our tank?

2628
01:56:32,370 --> 01:56:33,150
Do we have a tank?

2629
01:56:33,370 --> 01:56:34,090
Wait, guys.

2630
01:56:35,430 --> 01:56:35,990
Guys.

2631
01:56:36,790 --> 01:56:39,290
The question is, do we have a tank?

2632
01:56:43,650 --> 01:56:45,270
Guys, we have Venom.

2633
01:56:45,390 --> 01:56:45,590
Guys, we have Venom.

2634
01:56:45,590 --> 01:56:46,150
Okay, that's good.

2635
01:56:46,790 --> 01:56:47,930
We have Venom.

2636
01:56:49,430 --> 01:56:51,230
At least we have Venom.

2637
01:56:51,550 --> 01:56:52,650
What was my Q?

2638
01:56:56,050 --> 01:56:57,410
I don't know what my Q does.

2639
01:56:57,770 --> 01:56:59,830
Guys, I didn't read for my Q.

2640
01:57:06,100 --> 01:57:08,020
Oh, what did I do?

2641
01:57:08,020 --> 01:57:08,060
What did I do?

2642
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:11,720
I don't even know what I just did.

2643
01:57:16,120 --> 01:57:17,120
Oh my god.

2644
01:57:17,320 --> 01:57:18,780
I can him.

2645
01:57:19,740 --> 01:57:20,720
He's really bad.

2646
01:57:23,080 --> 01:57:25,260
I know who I can kill.

2647
01:57:25,860 --> 01:57:27,340
I know who's actually bad.

2648
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:32,720
Come on.

2649
01:57:35,160 --> 01:57:35,840
Stop!

2650
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:36,400
Stop!

2651
01:57:38,620 --> 01:57:39,940
Stop parkouring!

2652
01:57:39,940 --> 01:57:41,820
Stop parkouring!

2653
01:57:45,240 --> 01:57:46,480
Oh my god.

2654
01:57:46,780 --> 01:57:50,160
Okay, I can farm the fucking Starlord.

2655
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:52,280
But I need the other guy to fucking stop.

2656
01:57:52,960 --> 01:57:55,420
He needs to stop parkouring.

2657
01:57:56,020 --> 01:58:00,040
I'm too tired for this shit.

2658
01:58:05,980 --> 01:58:06,740
Okay.

2659
01:58:06,740 --> 01:58:07,920
The Groot is actually...

2660
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:08,860
It's so annoying.

2661
01:58:11,820 --> 01:58:13,600
I can dash.

2662
01:58:13,860 --> 01:58:16,580
Wait, I could have done that this entire time.

2663
01:58:16,940 --> 01:58:17,980
Okay, now I know.

2664
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:20,940
Okay.

2665
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:21,880
No!

2666
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:24,180
That's what it was!

2667
01:58:24,940 --> 01:58:26,860
That's what the ult was!

2668
01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:28,680
Okay, now I know.

2669
01:58:30,440 --> 01:58:31,540
Oh, blue Venom.

2670
01:58:31,600 --> 01:58:32,840
Wait, he already has cosmetics?

2671
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:34,700
That's crazy.

2672
01:58:36,260 --> 01:58:37,220
I never read.

2673
01:58:37,320 --> 01:58:37,940
That's my problem.

2674
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:40,440
I read, but I read like one sentence.

2675
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:42,200
And I'll be like, I understand now.

2676
01:58:43,720 --> 01:58:44,840
I feel like sometimes my...

2677
01:58:47,060 --> 01:58:48,760
I'll be like, I understand.

2678
01:58:49,100 --> 01:58:50,180
I read one sentence.

2679
01:58:53,160 --> 01:58:53,640
Okay.

2680
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:55,360
I can ult this.

2681
01:58:55,860 --> 01:58:57,040
Oh, I don't know if I should.

2682
01:58:57,140 --> 01:58:59,240
I'll wait until we get a safer ult.

2683
01:58:59,240 --> 01:59:00,540
Like right here.

2684
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:01,920
Because I think my team needs it.

2685
01:59:05,160 --> 01:59:06,520
Oh my god!

2686
01:59:15,100 --> 01:59:17,100
Did we not kill anybody?

2687
01:59:20,100 --> 01:59:21,140
Jesus Christ.

2688
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:22,300
Okay, that's fine.

2689
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:23,440
We got one kill though.

2690
01:59:27,730 --> 01:59:29,390
It's okay, we got one kill.

2691
01:59:29,390 --> 01:59:30,630
That's all that matters, right?

2692
01:59:33,210 --> 01:59:34,430
I'm trying.

2693
01:59:34,670 --> 01:59:36,530
I'm hitting as much as I can.

2694
01:59:36,690 --> 01:59:39,170
I have not stopped pressing...

2695
01:59:39,170 --> 01:59:40,090
Oh shit.

2696
01:59:40,770 --> 01:59:42,970
I haven't stopped pressing left click.

2697
01:59:43,170 --> 01:59:45,090
I fucking haven't.

2698
01:59:47,490 --> 01:59:50,990
I haven't stopped pressing left click.

2699
01:59:51,170 --> 01:59:52,590
What should I do?

2700
01:59:55,230 --> 01:59:56,630
Okay, maybe I should play different.

2701
01:59:56,630 --> 01:59:57,870
Maybe I should.

2702
02:00:00,150 --> 02:00:01,550
I need to suppress fire.

2703
02:00:03,310 --> 02:00:05,150
Suppressing fire time.

2704
02:00:06,470 --> 02:00:07,770
I don't know if I like psionic.

2705
02:00:09,470 --> 02:00:10,130
This time.

2706
02:00:24,710 --> 02:00:25,990
That's fine.

2707
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:28,630
I suppressed fire.

2708
02:00:30,070 --> 02:00:31,470
That's fine.

2709
02:00:33,970 --> 02:00:34,910
Burrrrrrrrrrrrrr.

2710
02:00:35,370 --> 02:00:36,050

I couldn't help it No, I knew what my hero was.

2714
02:00:58,090 --> 02:01:04,590
I think like I need to be closer for Psylocke, I think I got a little greedy.

2715
02:01:04,690 --> 02:01:08,650
No, I definitely did I really really wanted to kill him.

2716
02:01:08,750 --> 02:01:09,790

2719
02:01:35,220 --> 02:01:41,000
You have to be like super um I think Psylocke gotta be like close range for it.

2720
02:01:41,080 --> 02:01:42,280
I think that's why I couldn't

2721
02:01:46,060 --> 02:02:16,960
It's fine, this is like the tank shredder which i'm what I didn't see Psylocke I didn't see her No I could have killed all of them Oh, she's basically melee, okay, I couldn't tell because she has like the I couldn't tell if she was melee Because she's like she has like the range So I didn't know that's like not range Basically No,

02:16:45,420 --> 02:17:10,800
So you play hawkeye when you have a team you can rely on but like there's like so many characters where like I feel like there's so many characters where it's like you have to have an actual team that you can play around with but like Punisher seems seems to be one where like even my team is like special I I can like pull something off

2824
02:17:15,150 --> 02:17:27,930

Oh, I had to charge it!

2910
02:26:35,540 --> 02:26:37,940
Oh my god!

2911
02:26:38,520 --> 02:26:42,360
Okay, I understand now.

2912
02:26:42,800 --> 02:26:45,740
I just didn't charge the stupid ult.

2913
02:26:48,360 --> 02:26:50,280
Oh my god.

2914
02:26:50,280 --> 02:26:54,120
But even then it took me like fucking forever to hit him.

2915
02:26:56,200 --> 02:26:57,760
Alright, see I told you.

2916
02:26:58,400 --> 02:26:59,400
Third time's the charm.

2917
02:27:00,220 --> 02:27:02,620
Third time's the charm.

2918
02:27:03,980 --> 02:27:05,120
I told you guys.

2919
02:27:08,400 --> 02:27:12,340
I can't like... like the range is so low for here.

2920
02:27:12,840 --> 02:27:13,660
I have to wait.

2921
02:27:16,860 --> 02:27:18,420
Like, what was he doing?

2922
02:27:25,140 --> 02:27:26,040
Oh no!

2923
02:27:26,340 --> 02:27:27,280
Not the moon!

2924
02:27:27,500 --> 02:27:28,680
Not the moon!

2925
02:27:29,280 --> 02:27:30,460
Not the moon!

2926
02:27:32,240 --> 02:27:32,740
Please!

2927
02:27:33,780 --> 02:27:35,480
Anything but the moon!

2928
02:27:37,500 --> 02:27:39,680
Okay, maybe it's Doctor Strange time.

2929
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:42,480
I don't know what was his plan.

2930
02:27:50,550 --> 02:27:51,610
Guys, this is real.

2931
02:27:51,650 --> 02:27:52,130
I'm sorry.

2932
02:27:52,410 --> 02:27:54,070
I don't know what I'm doing.

2933
02:27:55,250 --> 02:27:57,490
I'm sorry.

2934
02:27:57,710 --> 02:27:59,190
That was a really...

2935
02:27:59,190 --> 02:28:03,250
That was a really bad portal.

2936
02:28:05,790 --> 02:28:10,850
That was actually a portal of all time.

2937
02:28:14,130 --> 02:28:15,510
Oh no.

2938
02:28:16,490 --> 02:28:17,050
Oh no.

2939
02:28:17,210 --> 02:28:17,450
No!

2940
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:23,970
Guys, you guys didn't touch the payload!

2941
02:28:28,130 --> 02:28:32,890
Okay, I've sort of like realized about how to do the portal.

2942
02:28:33,690 --> 02:28:35,030
But like, I feel like I should head over.

2943
02:28:36,450 --> 02:28:38,570
Okay, we figured it out.

2944
02:28:40,270 --> 02:28:41,790
It was indeed a portal.

2945
02:28:45,270 --> 02:28:46,390
Oh my god.

2946
02:28:47,970 --> 02:28:50,090
I told you, it's a Punisher diff.

2947
02:28:50,370 --> 02:28:51,450
It's literally...

2948
02:28:53,310 --> 02:28:55,170
It's a Punisher diff.

2949
02:28:57,010 --> 02:28:57,530
Wait.

2950
02:28:58,070 --> 02:28:58,910
Oh, thank god.

2951
02:28:58,990 --> 02:29:01,450
Okay, I'm happy that like...

2952
02:29:02,670 --> 02:29:04,350
DPS did more damage than me.

2953
02:29:04,410 --> 02:29:05,590
I would have been so sad.

2954
02:29:05,730 --> 02:29:09,550
I would have been really sad if DPS did not do more damage than me.

2955
02:29:09,970 --> 02:29:11,710
Am I like playing with console players?

2956
02:29:12,450 --> 02:29:13,610
Oh my god.

2957
02:29:13,910 --> 02:29:15,690
There's so many console players.

2958
02:29:19,110 --> 02:29:21,110
I don't know if I like melee DPS.

2959
02:29:21,510 --> 02:29:23,150
I think I like...

2960
02:29:23,150 --> 02:29:24,630
I like... I don't know.

2961
02:29:24,790 --> 02:29:28,030
I think melee DPS is like not as fun for me.

2962
02:29:28,930 --> 02:29:29,370
Let's see.

2963
02:29:29,690 --> 02:29:30,470
Oh my god.

2964
02:29:30,650 --> 02:29:31,010
No.

2965
02:29:31,790 --> 02:29:32,170
It's okay.

2966
02:29:32,230 --> 02:29:33,530
I'll play DPS.

2967
02:29:35,330 --> 02:29:36,070
Let's see.

2968
02:29:36,150 --> 02:29:37,150
I'll play DPS.

2969
02:29:37,910 --> 02:29:41,090
I'm not a huge fan of melee.

2970
02:29:46,320 --> 02:29:47,700
I did it.

2971
02:29:49,100 --> 02:29:49,680
Nice.

2972
02:29:51,820 --> 02:29:53,100
I did it.

2973
02:29:55,500 --> 02:29:56,480
I won!

2974
02:29:59,700 --> 02:30:01,740
My god, let's fucking go!

2975
02:30:03,820 --> 02:30:06,000
I got easiest game of my life.

2976
02:30:06,140 --> 02:30:07,340
I won!

2977
02:30:14,040 --> 02:30:15,500
I did it.

2978
02:30:15,900 --> 02:30:17,240
So easy.

2979
02:30:17,780 --> 02:30:18,920
Guys, look at that.

2980
02:30:20,420 --> 02:30:21,740
So fucking easy.

2981
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:24,660
So good.

2982
02:30:24,660 --> 02:30:28,980
When you're so good the game that you win in like one second.

2983
02:30:29,440 --> 02:30:32,320
That's how good I am at TPS games.

2984
02:30:32,360 --> 02:30:33,480
I forgot this is third person.

2985
02:30:34,500 --> 02:30:35,320
Perfect stats?

2986
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:35,980
Exactly!

2987
02:30:36,360 --> 02:30:37,600
It's perfect stats!

2988
02:30:37,880 --> 02:30:39,020
Oh my god, you're right!

2989
02:30:40,320 --> 02:30:40,780
Perfect.

2990
02:30:43,420 --> 02:30:44,560
Casey, thank you for the super chat.

2991
02:30:44,620 --> 02:30:45,220
Thank you, thank you.

2992
02:30:45,280 --> 02:30:46,100
Hope you had a good day today.

2993
02:30:46,160 --> 02:30:48,500
Please accept this super chat as thanks for always working hard.

2994
02:30:48,600 --> 02:30:49,460
Thank you for the super chat.

2995
02:30:49,580 --> 02:30:50,360
Thank you.

2996
02:30:50,520 --> 02:30:51,740
I really appreciate it.

2997
02:30:51,800 --> 02:30:53,100
Thank you so much!

2998
02:30:54,260 --> 02:30:55,080
What do I want to try?

2999
02:30:55,160 --> 02:30:56,060
Should I try Iron Man?

3000
02:30:58,600 --> 02:30:59,240
Fire Devastate.

3001
02:30:59,300 --> 02:31:00,820
I want to try... Okay, let's try a new character.

3002
02:31:01,400 --> 02:31:03,020
Okay, we'll try Wolverine.

3003
02:31:04,620 --> 02:31:04,940
Alright.

3004
02:31:05,440 --> 02:31:06,320
We'll do a melee.

3005
02:31:06,320 --> 02:31:07,760
Launch up enemy.

3006
02:31:08,140 --> 02:31:11,120
Leap like an animal to snatch the first enemy upon impact.

3007
02:31:11,240 --> 02:31:11,620
Oh shit.

3008
02:31:11,680 --> 02:31:11,960
Okay.

3009
02:31:13,640 --> 02:31:14,240
Alright.

3010
02:31:17,080 --> 02:31:17,620
Skip.

3011
02:31:18,080 --> 02:31:18,940
I need to read this.

3012
02:31:19,900 --> 02:31:22,960
Unleash a fierce howl to reduce incoming damage.

3013
02:31:23,500 --> 02:31:26,000
Dash forward and unleash a claw strike.

3014
02:31:26,160 --> 02:31:27,080
Okay, claw strike.

3015
02:31:27,640 --> 02:31:28,420
Claw strike.

3016
02:31:28,580 --> 02:31:29,480
Leap like an animal.

3017
02:31:29,840 --> 02:31:30,680
Reduce damage.

3018
02:31:30,840 --> 02:31:31,120
Okay.

3019
02:31:33,020 --> 02:31:34,900
And then that...

3020
02:31:34,900 --> 02:31:36,980
This is where I jump in and then...

3021
02:31:37,580 --> 02:31:38,920
Okay, we're fine.

3022
02:31:39,220 --> 02:31:40,100
I figured it out.

3023
02:31:41,120 --> 02:31:41,700
I read it.

3024
02:31:42,160 --> 02:31:43,680
I read it super fast.

3025
02:31:45,100 --> 02:31:48,500
I'll run any remaining rage builds when a Wolverine attacks or ticks it.

3026
02:31:48,600 --> 02:31:51,220
Okay, so I get more HP if I do more damage.

3027
02:31:51,800 --> 02:31:52,080
Alright.

3028
02:31:53,780 --> 02:31:54,640
This is fine.

3029
02:31:55,700 --> 02:31:56,540
We have healers.

3030
02:31:56,840 --> 02:31:57,900
We have one healer.

3031
02:31:58,360 --> 02:31:59,220
I believe in us.

3032
02:32:03,220 --> 02:32:04,920
Oh my god, this is so fast.

3033
02:32:05,420 --> 02:32:08,460
But I can only do it like... Wait, where...

3034
02:32:09,460 --> 02:32:10,260
Okay, guys.

3035
02:32:10,380 --> 02:32:12,080
Where's the... Oh, that's the objective.

3036
02:32:12,600 --> 02:32:15,420
I was like... Wait a minute, guys.

3037
02:32:19,910 --> 02:32:20,390
Yes!

3038
02:32:22,910 --> 02:32:24,010
I'm so angry!

3039
02:32:27,950 --> 02:32:28,950
I'm so angry!

3040
02:32:29,630 --> 02:32:30,410
That's Rookie Riot!

3041
02:32:32,970 --> 02:32:35,270
Oh my god, I'm so fucking mad!

3042
02:32:42,210 --> 02:32:43,810
I'm so angry!

3043
02:32:46,410 --> 02:32:47,650
Okay, alright.

3044
02:32:48,090 --> 02:32:48,610
It's fine.

3045
02:32:49,070 --> 02:32:49,550
It's fine.

3046
02:32:51,530 --> 02:32:53,150
I'm angry now.

3047
02:32:53,650 --> 02:32:54,910
That's fucking right.

3048
02:32:56,770 --> 02:32:59,490
Oh, I lose my rage if I get less angry.

3049
02:33:00,590 --> 02:33:01,000
Is that...

3050
02:33:01,490 --> 02:33:02,770
Who would've thought?

3051
02:33:03,010 --> 02:33:05,050
You can lose your rage when you get less...

3052
02:33:05,050 --> 02:33:05,550
I don't know.

3053
02:33:05,710 --> 02:33:07,370
I'm getting therapy, guys.

3054
02:33:07,510 --> 02:33:09,410
This is not good for Wolverine.

3055
02:33:10,790 --> 02:33:11,970
This is not good.

3056
02:33:16,890 --> 02:33:18,570
Oh, I'm so angry!

3057
02:33:19,250 --> 02:33:20,670
I'm so angry!

3058
02:33:20,990 --> 02:33:22,070
He's one!

3059
02:33:22,870 --> 02:33:24,030
He's solo!

3060
02:33:25,830 --> 02:33:26,710
Get him!

3061
02:33:29,860 --> 02:33:30,780
Nice, we got him.

3062
02:33:36,800 --> 02:33:37,980
They don't know I'm here.

3063
02:33:38,960 --> 02:33:39,980
Oh, they do.

3064
02:33:41,640 --> 02:33:42,560
That's Rookie Riot.

3065
02:33:42,920 --> 02:33:44,180
That's right, what are you gonna do?

3066
02:33:44,520 --> 02:33:45,780
Oh shit, you're gonna do that?

3067
02:33:47,320 --> 02:33:48,480
I'm still angry!

3068
02:33:49,160 --> 02:33:50,800
I'm still so angry!

3069
02:33:51,840 --> 02:33:54,100
This is so broken, holy fuck.

3070
02:33:54,620 --> 02:33:55,960
Okay, I'm okay.

3071
02:33:58,060 --> 02:33:59,300
I'm okay, guys.

3072
02:34:03,020 --> 02:34:04,960
How did I live that long?

3073
02:34:08,460 --> 02:34:09,540
Don't worry, guys.

3074
02:34:12,980 --> 02:34:13,980
That's Rookie Riot!

3075
02:34:14,080 --> 02:34:14,300
Oh!

3076
02:34:15,440 --> 02:34:16,600
That's Rookie Riot!

3077
02:34:17,240 --> 02:34:18,140
Get over here!

3078
02:34:18,880 --> 02:34:20,120
I don't need therapy!

3079
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:21,160
I don't...

3080
02:34:21,160 --> 02:34:21,800
Oh, I...

3081
02:34:21,800 --> 02:34:23,120
Oh, fuck.

3082
02:34:23,600 --> 02:34:25,020
It's fine, we won this, right?

3083
02:34:25,980 --> 02:34:28,780
Wolverine is amazing in 1v1.

3084
02:34:31,600 --> 02:34:33,040
Why are you angry?

3085
02:34:33,200 --> 02:34:34,480
Because I'm winning.

3086
02:34:40,880 --> 02:34:41,500
Hahaha!

3087
02:34:42,580 --> 02:34:43,600
We're fine.

3088
02:34:43,740 --> 02:34:44,840
We're so fine.

3089
02:34:51,900 --> 02:34:54,440
I don't know.

3090
02:34:54,820 --> 02:34:56,800
I think my team is actually good, though.

3091
02:34:57,040 --> 02:34:59,060
I think I'm getting like...

3092
02:34:59,060 --> 02:35:01,280
Yeah, like our Black Panther...

3093
02:35:01,280 --> 02:35:04,720
Our Black Panther actually knows how to play this game.

3094
02:35:05,120 --> 02:35:05,980
So I can...

3095
02:35:05,980 --> 02:35:08,000
I can do whatever the fuck I want.

3096
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:09,920
Wait, what is my...

3097
02:35:09,920 --> 02:35:10,480
Whoa, shit.

3098
02:35:10,640 --> 02:35:12,120
What is my Q?

3099
02:35:13,540 --> 02:35:17,220
Ahead and spout sweeping up enemies and dealing devastating impact.

3100
02:35:17,480 --> 02:35:18,500
Okay, there we go.

3101
02:35:18,760 --> 02:35:19,220
That's fine.

3102
02:35:20,740 --> 02:35:23,040
That's all you and me anger.

3103
02:35:23,440 --> 02:35:25,220
I literally think it's...

3104
02:35:25,220 --> 02:35:26,040
It's...

3105
02:35:26,040 --> 02:35:26,580
Our...

3106
02:35:27,360 --> 02:35:27,960
Our...

3107
02:35:27,960 --> 02:35:32,640
Our Black Panther is killing really hard right now while I'm just fucking around.

3108
02:35:36,340 --> 02:35:39,500
Perfect time to throw when you get a stacked team.

3109
02:35:39,600 --> 02:35:41,140
I don't know how that feels.

3110
02:35:41,420 --> 02:35:44,980
This is like the first time I've actually have a team that knows what they're doing.

3111
02:35:45,180 --> 02:35:46,280
I'm gonna go with this guy.

3112
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:48,520
I'm gonna go with Black Panther.

3113
02:35:48,680 --> 02:35:50,340
Okay, never mind.

3114
02:35:53,360 --> 02:35:54,680
Ooh, that's fucking right.

3115
02:35:56,380 --> 02:35:56,860
Ooh.

3116
02:36:00,600 --> 02:36:01,360
That's right!

3117
02:36:01,640 --> 02:36:03,300
I hate you specifically!

3118
02:36:03,300 --> 02:36:03,440
Specifically!

3119
02:36:08,560 --> 02:36:09,920
Holy shit.

3120
02:36:10,220 --> 02:36:11,440
Oh my god.

3121
02:36:11,800 --> 02:36:14,160
Fuck that one guy in particular.

3122
02:36:14,640 --> 02:36:16,040
Don't keep up.

3123
02:36:18,540 --> 02:36:20,940
You are the source of all my hate.

3124
02:36:23,540 --> 02:36:24,220
Nice.

3125
02:36:26,420 --> 02:36:26,660
Alright.

3126
02:36:26,860 --> 02:36:28,520
I don't know how long that buff lasts.

3127
02:36:29,720 --> 02:36:30,920
Tanking the thing.

3128
02:36:31,840 --> 02:36:32,560
It's okay.

3129
02:36:32,560 --> 02:36:33,700
That was worth it.

3130
02:36:33,820 --> 02:36:35,200
Honestly, that was so worth it.

3131
02:36:38,920 --> 02:36:39,840
Oh shit.

3132
02:36:40,740 --> 02:36:41,460
Who's dying?

3133
02:36:43,320 --> 02:36:44,600
Oh, they're like over here.

3134
02:36:45,440 --> 02:36:47,520
Don't worry, they have to get closer to me.

3135
02:36:47,780 --> 02:36:48,960
And they're scared.

3136
02:36:51,180 --> 02:36:52,540
Oh my god, yeah!

3137
02:36:53,960 --> 02:36:57,360
I'm fucking gonna beat you up from the sky.

3138
02:36:58,680 --> 02:36:59,940
I'm so angry again.

3139
02:37:00,340 --> 02:37:00,900
Oh shit.

3140
02:37:00,900 --> 02:37:02,360
Oh, guys, guys.

3141
02:37:02,420 --> 02:37:03,460
I don't wanna be angry anymore.

3142
02:37:03,560 --> 02:37:05,080
I don't wanna be angry anymore, guys.

3143
02:37:05,240 --> 02:37:06,840
I don't know, guys.

3144
02:37:07,140 --> 02:37:08,740
I regret being angry.

3145
02:37:11,360 --> 02:37:11,960
That's right!

3146
02:37:12,180 --> 02:37:12,980
I don't regret!

3147
02:37:14,300 --> 02:37:14,780
Die!

3148
02:37:15,020 --> 02:37:15,680
Okay, nice.

3149
02:37:16,820 --> 02:37:17,700
That's fucking right.

3150
02:37:18,520 --> 02:37:19,740
Who needs therapy?

3151
02:37:19,900 --> 02:37:20,700
Guys, you should go to therapy.

3152
02:37:20,780 --> 02:37:22,780
Who needs anger management class?

3153
02:37:24,940 --> 02:37:26,120
Who needs it?

3154
02:37:26,200 --> 02:37:28,320
This is my anger management class.

3155
02:37:30,900 --> 02:37:31,940
Oh my god.

3156
02:37:32,420 --> 02:37:34,340
I don't know how I'm getting away with this, actually.

3157
02:37:34,520 --> 02:37:35,020
Oh, goodbye.

3158
02:37:36,380 --> 02:37:37,840
I'm just gonna walk away.

3159
02:37:40,720 --> 02:37:42,920
Get down from the sky, you moth!

3160
02:37:42,940 --> 02:37:43,800
Oh, never mind.

3161
02:37:44,420 --> 02:37:45,820
I got shot in the back.

3162
02:37:50,120 --> 02:37:51,220
Okay, this is not fair.

3163
02:37:51,520 --> 02:37:52,920
They're all doing range now.

3164
02:37:53,380 --> 02:37:55,440
Like, what am I supposed to do?

3165
02:37:57,900 --> 02:37:59,440
They're all in the sky!

3166
02:38:00,620 --> 02:38:01,060
Wait!

3167
02:38:03,800 --> 02:38:05,160
That's fucked.

3168
02:38:06,180 --> 02:38:07,940
They all went in...

3169
02:38:09,780 --> 02:38:11,900
They're all in the sky now.

3170
02:38:12,280 --> 02:38:14,240
What am I supposed to do?

3171
02:38:18,510 --> 02:38:21,530
What do you do when they're in the sky?

3172
02:38:22,290 --> 02:38:24,130
Oh, I'm gonna watch Venom die.

3173
02:38:24,810 --> 02:38:26,350
There's no way.

3174
02:38:27,410 --> 02:38:29,150
Alright, this is good.

3175
02:38:31,490 --> 02:38:32,530
That's fucking right!

3176
02:38:32,530 --> 02:38:34,090
Fuck you in particular!

3177
02:38:36,770 --> 02:38:37,830
Where are you?

3178
02:38:38,210 --> 02:38:40,110
Oh, you think you can get away?

3179
02:38:41,790 --> 02:38:42,830
Oh shit.

3180
02:38:43,310 --> 02:38:44,250
Oh shit, he's...

3181
02:38:44,250 --> 02:38:44,410
Woah!

3182
02:38:44,730 --> 02:38:45,930
Let me just...

3183
02:38:45,930 --> 02:38:47,490
Let me just walk away.

3184
02:38:51,150 --> 02:38:54,250
Let me just walk away real fast.

3185
02:38:56,910 --> 02:38:57,590
Woah!

3186
02:38:57,590 --> 02:38:58,090
Woah!

3187
02:39:01,380 --> 02:39:03,810
I just saw a storm and I just...

3188
02:39:03,810 --> 02:39:05,910
backed off.

3189
02:39:06,210 --> 02:39:09,390
World's most nicest kidney eating character.

3190
02:39:12,830 --> 02:39:14,530
Oh my god, two in a row.

3191
02:39:15,170 --> 02:39:15,970
I never...

3192
02:39:15,970 --> 02:39:19,230
I never knew how that felt like until today.

3193
02:39:23,020 --> 02:39:24,680
Oh my god.

3194
02:39:25,760 --> 02:39:27,660
This is the first time...

3195
02:39:27,660 --> 02:39:30,640
I got experienced two in a row.

3196
02:39:32,360 --> 02:39:34,200
Two... oh yeah, guys.

3197
02:39:34,860 --> 02:39:35,420
Yeah.

3198
02:39:37,420 --> 02:39:40,480
Oh thank god I didn't have to carry.

3199
02:39:41,180 --> 02:39:42,920
Thank fucking god.

3200
02:39:47,020 --> 02:39:48,360
I like that.

3201
02:39:49,220 --> 02:39:53,940
I like actually being able to fuck around instead of swapping to Punisher.

3202
02:39:58,160 --> 02:39:59,660
Thank fucking god.

3203
02:40:00,340 --> 02:40:01,720
Alright, let's see.

3204
02:40:02,700 --> 02:40:05,400
What do I want to play this time?

3205
02:40:05,980 --> 02:40:08,360
I feel like I played almost all the new characters.

3206
02:40:08,500 --> 02:40:11,000
Oh, I don't want to play Tekken right now.

3207
02:40:11,420 --> 02:40:13,100
I don't really.

3208
02:40:13,620 --> 02:40:13,920
Alright.

3209
02:40:15,400 --> 02:40:16,300
It's fine.

3210
02:40:16,520 --> 02:40:18,140
It's time to actually play Loki.

3211
02:40:23,500 --> 02:40:24,600
This is fine.

3212
02:40:29,850 --> 02:40:32,250
We finally get a chance to try out Loki.

3213
02:40:32,570 --> 02:40:36,110
I wonder if they buffed him or if he's like the same as Beta.

3214
02:40:37,530 --> 02:40:38,890
For those who don't know, like the...

3215
02:40:41,930 --> 02:40:43,890
The Beta version was like...

3216
02:40:45,110 --> 02:40:48,910
Alpha was like super OP and then Beta was like...

3217
02:40:48,910 --> 02:40:51,230
The Beta version was like really weak.

3218
02:40:53,150 --> 02:40:54,150
What was E?

3219
02:40:54,670 --> 02:40:54,890
Oh.

3220
02:40:55,930 --> 02:40:56,470
Okay.

3221
02:40:56,470 --> 02:40:57,570
And then...

3222
02:40:58,710 --> 02:40:59,530
Snap, okay.

3223
02:41:01,230 --> 02:41:02,790
Oh girl, thank you for the raid!

3224
02:41:02,950 --> 02:41:03,870
Thank you, thank you!

3225
02:41:04,850 --> 02:41:05,930
Alright, let's try.

3226
02:41:10,760 --> 02:41:11,300
Snap!

3227
02:41:13,140 --> 02:41:14,680
I forgot about...

3228
02:41:16,560 --> 02:41:17,120
Whoops.

3229
02:41:17,680 --> 02:41:20,560
I forgot about my other Loki shadow.

3230
02:41:20,880 --> 02:41:22,800
I was like, wait a minute, I went backwards.

3231
02:41:23,240 --> 02:41:24,540
That doesn't seem right.

3232
02:41:25,140 --> 02:41:27,480
How did I go backwards?

3233
02:41:31,200 --> 02:41:34,460
Oh, Black Panther, I can't heal you like this!

3234
02:41:34,980 --> 02:41:36,200
I can't heal you!

3235
02:41:39,020 --> 02:41:40,520
Stay in my zone!

3236
02:41:43,760 --> 02:41:45,240
Stay in my zone!

3237
02:41:48,020 --> 02:41:50,260
Come on guys, one kill!

3238
02:41:51,220 --> 02:41:52,880
One kill guys!

3239
02:41:55,960 --> 02:41:57,320
Come on guys!

3240
02:41:57,460 --> 02:41:58,480
Oh, that's fine!

3241
02:41:58,480 --> 02:42:00,140
I didn't guess we all die!

3242
02:42:02,250 --> 02:42:03,000
That's okay!

3243
02:42:03,580 --> 02:42:05,860
Like, we don't have to be alive or anything.

3244
02:42:07,240 --> 02:42:09,060
Like, that's okay!

3245
02:42:13,910 --> 02:42:15,150
Guys, just...

3246
02:42:15,150 --> 02:42:16,430
One kill!

3247
02:42:18,270 --> 02:42:19,010
One kill!

3248
02:42:19,170 --> 02:42:20,110
Oh, that's okay!

3249
02:42:20,350 --> 02:42:22,330
We'll eventually get that one kill guys!

3250
02:42:24,370 --> 02:42:24,990
Guys?

3251
02:42:26,970 --> 02:42:29,010
We're gonna get that one kill, right?

3252
02:42:30,990 --> 02:42:32,030
Right, guys?

3253
02:42:37,450 --> 02:42:38,070
Don't worry.

3254
02:42:38,190 --> 02:42:39,150
Is it because we don't have a tank?

3255
02:42:39,270 --> 02:42:39,710
No, we do.

3256
02:42:39,790 --> 02:42:40,590
We have two tanks now.

3257
02:42:41,530 --> 02:42:43,330
Okay, I can...

3258
02:42:44,950 --> 02:42:45,950
Alright, get in there!

3259
02:42:46,110 --> 02:42:46,410
Get in there!

3260
02:42:46,470 --> 02:42:47,090
Use the heal!

3261
02:42:47,610 --> 02:42:49,430
Use the ultimate heal orb!

3262
02:42:51,670 --> 02:42:52,870
Oh my god, please!

3263
02:42:53,590 --> 02:42:54,910
Don't make me become you!

3264
02:42:55,790 --> 02:42:57,210
I'm gonna become you now!

3265
02:43:00,330 --> 02:43:01,210
That's fucking right!

3266
02:43:02,710 --> 02:43:04,170
I'm gonna eat you!

3267
02:43:04,670 --> 02:43:06,030
I'm gonna eat you!

3268
02:43:06,330 --> 02:43:08,470
Oh, I fucking... I made a mistake!

3269
02:43:08,810 --> 02:43:10,510
I don't want... I made a mistake!

3270
02:43:10,890 --> 02:43:11,830
I'm so sorry!

3271
02:43:14,350 --> 02:43:15,450
Guys, please!

3272
02:43:16,210 --> 02:43:17,030
Please, guys!

3273
02:43:19,070 --> 02:43:19,770
Please!

3274
02:43:24,710 --> 02:43:25,410
Okay...

3275
02:43:25,410 --> 02:43:26,310
I...

3276
02:43:26,310 --> 02:43:29,130
I think my team is struggling!

3277
02:43:29,130 --> 02:43:29,870
I...

3278
02:43:29,870 --> 02:43:31,690
I think...

3279
02:43:31,690 --> 02:43:32,810
I...

3280
02:43:32,810 --> 02:43:34,230
I think...

3281
02:43:34,230 --> 02:43:37,150
I think my team is not doing so well.

3282
02:43:37,550 --> 02:43:38,070
I...

3283
02:43:39,470 --> 02:43:41,230
I don't know yet!

3284
02:43:41,670 --> 02:43:42,750
I'm not sure.

3285
02:43:46,070 --> 02:43:48,470
I'm trying my best to keep them all up though.

3286
02:43:50,790 --> 02:43:54,130
Okay, the more clones I have, the more like...

3287
02:43:54,730 --> 02:43:55,650
Okay, there you go.

3288
02:43:55,670 --> 02:43:56,530
You can't kill me now.

3289
02:43:58,450 --> 02:44:00,030
That's fucking right!

3290
02:44:03,470 --> 02:44:04,510
That's right!

3291
02:44:07,290 --> 02:44:08,770
Oh my god, please just kill one.

3292
02:44:08,970 --> 02:44:10,930
Guys, team, team, team, team, team!

3293
02:44:11,270 --> 02:44:12,570
There's so many bubbles!

3294
02:44:13,130 --> 02:44:14,270
Just pick up a bubble!

3295
02:44:14,890 --> 02:44:17,430
Our sheriff gave so many bubbles for you!

3296
02:44:19,150 --> 02:44:21,070
Our sheriff kept giving you bubbles!

3297
02:44:21,070 --> 02:44:21,450
Bubbles!

3298
02:44:24,730 --> 02:44:26,970
All they did was give you bubbles!

3299
02:44:29,650 --> 02:44:31,550
Oh my god, guys, this is it!

3300
02:44:32,610 --> 02:44:33,590
Guys, please!

3301
02:44:34,130 --> 02:44:34,970
Please, we got killed!

3302
02:44:35,190 --> 02:44:36,970
Move up, move up, move up!

3303
02:44:38,110 --> 02:44:39,830
They're scared of the bubbles.

3304
02:44:40,330 --> 02:44:42,650
Oh my god, we finally made it!

3305
02:44:43,010 --> 02:44:45,190
We finally made it here!

3306
02:44:46,030 --> 02:44:48,910
It only took us one minute and twenty...

3307
02:44:48,910 --> 02:44:50,470
We only have one minute.

3308
02:44:51,210 --> 02:44:51,530
There we go.

3309
02:44:52,250 --> 02:44:53,550
There we go.

3310
02:44:54,770 --> 02:44:55,910
This makes it so that...

3311
02:44:56,790 --> 02:44:59,630
Me pressing shift makes it so that they can't kill us.

3312
02:45:00,170 --> 02:45:01,050
Okay, nice.

3313
02:45:03,050 --> 02:45:04,010
What the fuck?

3314
02:45:04,170 --> 02:45:04,410
No!

3315
02:45:05,450 --> 02:45:06,090
No!

3316
02:45:07,130 --> 02:45:08,630
Let me go!

3317
02:45:09,110 --> 02:45:09,690
No!

3318
02:45:10,170 --> 02:45:10,550
No!

3319
02:45:13,450 --> 02:45:14,910
Oh god, I'm alive!

3320
02:45:15,210 --> 02:45:15,810
I'm alive!

3321
02:45:15,810 --> 02:45:16,190
I'm alive!

3322
02:45:16,570 --> 02:45:19,230
Oh my god, thank fucking god, I'm alive!

3323
02:45:19,670 --> 02:45:20,910
Oh thank god!

3324
02:45:21,710 --> 02:45:23,690
That scared me, I thought...

3325
02:45:23,690 --> 02:45:25,210
Oh my god!

3326
02:45:26,930 --> 02:45:30,310
I got saved, but it didn't matter!

3327
02:45:31,090 --> 02:45:31,930
Shark boy!

3328
02:45:37,450 --> 02:45:39,810
Bro, the shark boy...

3329
02:45:40,910 --> 02:45:42,150
He's so scary!

3330
02:45:45,810 --> 02:45:46,810
It's fine, it's fine.

3331
02:45:46,930 --> 02:45:47,790
I'm gonna be the shark.

3332
02:45:48,670 --> 02:45:50,610
If I'm beating the shark, it'll be fine.

3333
02:45:53,850 --> 02:45:55,210
Stand in there, stand in there!

3334
02:45:57,950 --> 02:45:58,590
Stand in there!

3335
02:45:58,690 --> 02:46:00,270
We gotta get the shark, we gotta get the shark!

3336
02:46:00,410 --> 02:46:00,790
Where is he?

3337
02:46:01,210 --> 02:46:02,830
Where is he so I can steal his ability?

3338
02:46:04,030 --> 02:46:04,810
I need to steal his!

3339
02:46:06,110 --> 02:46:06,410
Yes!

3340
02:46:13,760 --> 02:46:14,500
Get over there.

3341
02:46:18,070 --> 02:46:18,650
That's fine!

3342
02:46:19,390 --> 02:46:20,070
That's fine!

3343
02:46:21,070 --> 02:46:22,510
That's fine, we got it!

3344
02:46:26,290 --> 02:46:29,230
Oh my god, that actually...

3345
02:46:30,290 --> 02:46:32,150
That actually clutched it.

3346
02:46:32,470 --> 02:46:35,130
That actually clutched it for us.

3347
02:46:35,350 --> 02:46:38,330
Oh my god, I swallowed them up!

3348
02:46:38,630 --> 02:46:39,510
So they could...

3349
02:46:40,170 --> 02:46:41,750
We don't deserve this win.

3350
02:46:41,970 --> 02:46:44,230
I don't think we're even gonna win, guys.

3351
02:46:44,330 --> 02:46:46,570
We absolutely do not deserve.

3352
02:46:50,290 --> 02:46:52,290
Like, oh my god.

3353
02:46:52,290 --> 02:46:53,990
I don't think...

3354
02:46:53,990 --> 02:46:56,460
I don't think we deserve it.

3355
02:46:59,690 --> 02:47:02,810
Bro, the ult is so fucking crazy.

3356
02:47:05,330 --> 02:47:07,650
We would've lost if I didn't do that.

3357
02:47:07,730 --> 02:47:09,150
We actually would've lost.

3358
02:47:09,690 --> 02:47:11,270
Like, that's the saddest part.

3359
02:47:11,550 --> 02:47:14,390
The fact that we would've lost if we did not...

3360
02:47:14,390 --> 02:47:16,210
If I didn't swallow.

3361
02:47:19,230 --> 02:47:21,010
Oh my god, he's gonna do it!

3362
02:47:23,110 --> 02:47:24,430
He's gonna do it!

3363
02:47:26,930 --> 02:47:28,290
Sharkboy, where are you?

3364
02:47:33,930 --> 02:47:35,330
Don't worry, Sharkboy!

3365
02:47:35,890 --> 02:47:38,910
Oh no, oh my god, he got Void too.

3366
02:47:39,450 --> 02:47:41,370
I just saw a man get Void.

3367
02:47:41,490 --> 02:47:42,290
I just saw...

3368
02:47:45,450 --> 02:47:47,070
Alright, bro, fuck this.

3369
02:47:47,130 --> 02:47:48,110
I don't trust my team.

3370
02:47:49,610 --> 02:47:50,470
It's time.

3371
02:47:52,290 --> 02:47:53,550
It's fucking time.

3372
02:47:54,310 --> 02:47:55,790
It's time to dance.

3373
02:47:57,150 --> 02:47:58,370
I don't think I can...

3374
02:47:58,370 --> 02:47:59,230
I can be the shark.

3375
02:47:59,270 --> 02:48:01,010
I don't think I can pull another shark move.

3376
02:48:06,770 --> 02:48:07,290
Jesus!

3377
02:48:07,610 --> 02:48:08,670
Oh shit!

3378
02:48:11,530 --> 02:48:12,710
It's fine, we're fine.

3379
02:48:15,270 --> 02:48:15,790
Guys!

3380
02:48:18,210 --> 02:48:18,730
Please!

3381
02:48:23,120 --> 02:48:24,540
Oh my god, thank god.

3382
02:48:24,660 --> 02:48:25,120
Okay, clap!

3383
02:48:25,520 --> 02:48:26,020
Clap!

3384
02:48:26,200 --> 02:48:26,540
No!

3385
02:48:26,540 --> 02:48:29,440
I'm trying to clap as hard as I can!

3386
02:48:29,760 --> 02:48:30,280
Oh!

3387
02:48:31,100 --> 02:48:32,360
Sharkboy, no!

3388
02:48:36,380 --> 02:48:37,100
Sharkboy!

3389
02:48:43,240 --> 02:48:43,820
It's fine.

3390
02:48:44,160 --> 02:48:45,440
I got him.

3391
02:48:45,680 --> 02:48:48,060
Bro, Icegirl does so much healing.

3392
02:48:48,280 --> 02:48:49,220
It's actually crazy.

3393
02:48:51,720 --> 02:48:53,320
She does so much.

3394
02:48:53,820 --> 02:48:55,020
Now we dance.

3395
02:48:55,020 --> 02:48:56,360
Please don't.

3396
02:48:56,500 --> 02:48:57,480
Please don't forward me.

3397
02:48:57,920 --> 02:48:59,200
Please, I can't.

3398
02:48:59,220 --> 02:49:00,860
Please don't forward me.

3399
02:49:01,240 --> 02:49:01,960
Please.

3400
02:49:02,400 --> 02:49:04,060
Please, I can't dance anymore.

3401
02:49:04,600 --> 02:49:06,220
The dancing stops now!

3402
02:49:09,420 --> 02:49:11,980
Guys, I can't keep dancing, guys!

3403
02:49:13,740 --> 02:49:14,600
Please, no!

3404
02:49:16,120 --> 02:49:16,840
No!

3405
02:49:20,860 --> 02:49:22,120
Oh, thank god.

3406
02:49:25,830 --> 02:49:26,910
Oh my god.

3407
02:49:27,750 --> 02:49:28,370
No!

3408
02:49:28,550 --> 02:49:29,190
He fucking...

3409
02:49:29,190 --> 02:49:32,230
Oh my god, this shark is so strong!

3410
02:49:33,630 --> 02:49:33,650
I had a

3411
02:49:39,620 --> 02:49:42,580
feeling we weren't going to win that.

3412
02:49:42,840 --> 02:49:45,720
The only reason we got the point was because I fucking boarded them.

3413
02:49:46,340 --> 02:49:48,100
That was the only reason.

3414
02:49:48,380 --> 02:49:51,120
That was literally the only reason we were able to get that point.

3415
02:49:52,120 --> 02:49:53,320
I was like...

3416
02:49:57,360 --> 02:49:58,320
I went...

3417
02:49:58,320 --> 02:49:59,860
And then we won.

3418
02:50:00,100 --> 02:50:01,220
We got the point.

3419
02:50:03,440 --> 02:50:05,600
But the shark is so strong!

3420
02:50:05,860 --> 02:50:06,160
Yeah!

3421
02:50:07,420 --> 02:50:09,140
I think the shark is meta.

3422
02:50:10,440 --> 02:50:11,260
Don't play shark.

3423
02:50:12,500 --> 02:50:13,700
Now it's my turn.

3424
02:50:14,280 --> 02:50:16,260
Now it's my turn to be the shark.

3425
02:50:18,580 --> 02:50:20,360
I feel like he is.

3426
02:50:20,560 --> 02:50:22,900
I feel like if you can coordinate...

3427
02:50:22,900 --> 02:50:25,080
If you can coordinate getting all the...

3428
02:50:25,080 --> 02:50:27,700
Because they can't leave this fucking mouth!

3429
02:50:27,780 --> 02:50:28,940
That's the worst part.

3430
02:50:31,840 --> 02:50:33,460
You can't leave his mouth!

3431
02:50:38,740 --> 02:50:40,360
Shark boy, where is lava girl?

3432
02:50:40,560 --> 02:50:40,880
True.

3433
02:50:42,040 --> 02:50:43,280
We're going to be on a plane!

3434
02:50:44,660 --> 02:50:45,940
Oh nice, we got a team up.

3435
02:50:46,640 --> 02:50:47,280
Okay, let's go.

3436
02:50:47,520 --> 02:50:48,260
Oh, he's so cute!

3437
02:50:48,440 --> 02:50:48,980
Look at him!

3438
02:51:02,780 --> 02:51:04,220
I'm ready for...

3439
02:51:04,680 --> 02:51:07,020
I think his right click is really strong too.

3440
02:51:07,260 --> 02:51:07,920
Not gonna lie.

3441
02:51:16,260 --> 02:51:18,360
Oh wait, is it ice shark powers?

3442
02:51:18,460 --> 02:51:19,560
Oh, it's because it's a team up!

3443
02:51:21,500 --> 02:51:23,740
Oh, we have like the team up ability now.

3444
02:51:24,180 --> 02:51:26,160
Now I'm like fast too when I shift.

3445
02:51:31,220 --> 02:51:34,640
Bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom.

Okay, we gotta head over to heal them.

3456
02:52:10,560 --> 02:52:12,500
Jesus Christ, that's so much damage.

3457
02:52:12,740 --> 02:52:14,020
What the fuck?

3458
02:52:14,940 --> 02:52:16,740
Why do I do so much damage?

3459
02:52:19,240 --> 02:52:20,340
That's crazy.

3460
02:52:20,800 --> 02:52:22,040
I'm reloading my mouth.

3461
02:52:23,040 --> 02:52:25,780
I was not expecting that much damage.

3462
02:52:26,600 --> 02:52:28,980
Bubble, bubble, take my bubbles.

3463
02:52:32,960 --> 02:52:34,720
Okay, spit the water.

3464
02:52:36,480 --> 02:52:37,760
Get over here!

3465
02:52:49,690 --> 02:52:51,570
Did I lead the shot?

3466
02:52:53,130 --> 02:52:54,790
Okay, let's see if I can grab him.

3467
02:52:55,230 --> 02:52:57,290
Yeah, I don't think he's gonna... yeah.

3468
02:52:58,930 --> 02:52:59,250
Oh!

3469
02:53:00,550 --> 02:53:01,230
It's okay.

3470
02:53:03,190 --> 02:53:05,130
We're fine, we're fine, we're okay, we're so safe.

3471
02:53:06,610 --> 02:53:08,730
I'll restock on the bubbles for us.

3472
02:53:09,190 --> 02:53:10,670
Just take the bubbles.

3473
02:53:13,010 --> 02:53:14,690
And my mouth is reloaded.

3474
02:53:17,590 --> 02:53:18,370
That's okay.

3475
02:53:22,590 --> 02:53:23,910
Just go up, go up!

3476
02:53:23,950 --> 02:53:24,550
Why are you scared?

3477
02:53:25,030 --> 02:53:25,910
He's so low!

3478
02:53:27,750 --> 02:53:29,490
All he has are his hands!

3479
02:53:32,030 --> 02:53:33,050
See, I got you.

3480
02:53:37,260 --> 02:53:38,120
I'm spitting!

3481
02:53:40,240 --> 02:53:41,200
It's okay.

3482
02:53:42,820 --> 02:53:44,180
Jesus Christ.

3483
02:53:44,580 --> 02:53:46,300
He has to be meta.

3484
02:53:46,980 --> 02:53:49,260
His damage is actually so strong.

3485
02:53:50,240 --> 02:53:52,600
His heals are really good too.

3486
02:53:57,300 --> 02:53:59,880
Guys, this is what I meant.

3487
02:54:04,640 --> 02:54:07,100
I think I can solo him.

3488
02:54:07,880 --> 02:54:09,540
I think I can!

3489
02:54:17,730 --> 02:54:19,910
That's my boy Jeff!

3490
02:54:21,290 --> 02:54:22,850
Go Jeff!

3491
02:54:26,290 --> 02:54:32,360
Oh my god, I literally solo'd a ting myself.

3492
02:54:33,120 --> 02:54:35,360
A chaos streak as a healer.

3493
02:54:35,660 --> 02:54:37,420
Yeah, that's actually crazy.

3494
02:54:37,580 --> 02:54:39,480
Wait, Jeff is so fucking OP.

3495
02:54:39,480 --> 02:54:41,800
Wait, this isn't fair!

3496
02:54:42,800 --> 02:54:43,900
The fuck?

3497
02:54:44,400 --> 02:54:47,740
I think it's Jeff and the fairy.

3498
02:54:48,140 --> 02:54:48,800
What's her name?

3499
02:54:49,200 --> 02:54:49,740
Luna Fairy?

3500
02:54:50,520 --> 02:54:55,500
I think it's Jeff and Luna Fairy as the meta healers.

3501
02:55:01,070 --> 02:55:02,450
Swim up walls, watch.

3502
02:55:04,410 --> 02:55:05,230
Okay, not.

3503
02:55:05,510 --> 02:55:05,730
See?

3504
02:55:06,410 --> 02:55:07,430
Okay, I had to...

3505
02:55:08,270 --> 02:55:09,590
I can wall climb.

3506
02:55:11,070 --> 02:55:13,030
I just don't do it because there's no point.

3507
02:55:18,930 --> 02:55:20,310
Oh, Luna Snow.

3508
02:55:21,770 --> 02:55:23,190
I thought she was a fairy.

3509
02:55:31,890 --> 02:55:32,650
Let's go.

3510
02:55:34,150 --> 02:55:36,030
Oh no, they can see my fin.

3511
02:55:36,310 --> 02:55:38,030
They can see my...

3512
02:55:40,390 --> 02:55:43,530
They can see my fin and stuff if I try to...

3513
02:55:43,530 --> 02:55:44,050
Don't worry!

3514
02:55:44,650 --> 02:55:45,410
Take the...

3515
02:55:47,450 --> 02:55:48,870
Take it!

3516
02:55:50,970 --> 02:55:52,590
It's okay, I can solo him!

3517
02:55:55,450 --> 02:55:57,370
Okay, somebody has to capture though.

3518
02:55:57,970 --> 02:55:59,490
My mouth has been reloaded.

3519
02:55:59,970 --> 02:56:02,450
Every time I eat, I reload.

3520
02:56:04,150 --> 02:56:05,730
Wait, wait a minute.

3521
02:56:06,070 --> 02:56:07,070
Wait, I can all...

3522
02:56:07,070 --> 02:56:08,310
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3523
02:56:30,950 --> 02:56:34,970
Oh shit, oh shit, Magneto, no!

3524
02:56:36,490 --> 02:56:37,490
That's fucking right.

3525
02:56:37,830 --> 02:56:38,930
You don't get this.

3526
02:56:39,410 --> 02:56:41,830
I'm stronger than you, Magneto!

3527
02:56:42,990 --> 02:56:45,330
I've got the...

3528
02:56:45,330 --> 02:56:46,690
This is so bullshit for you!

3529
02:56:48,310 --> 02:56:49,990
I have the bubble!

3530
02:56:50,730 --> 02:56:54,050
I'm so stupid.

3531
02:56:54,970 --> 02:56:55,450
I...

3532
02:56:55,450 --> 02:56:57,750
That's actually so stupid.

3533
02:56:58,970 --> 02:57:00,090
Holy shit.

3534
02:57:00,510 --> 02:57:01,930
These poor guys.

3535
02:57:02,210 --> 02:57:03,970
I don't think they want to play anymore.

3536
02:57:04,410 --> 02:57:08,730
Oh, Jeff, you think you can Jeff this?

3537
02:57:11,970 --> 02:57:13,870
There can only be one Jeff here.

3538
02:57:14,830 --> 02:57:17,390
Oh, I'm gonna back away a little bit though.

3539
02:57:18,630 --> 02:57:21,310
There can only be one Jeff.

3540
02:57:23,750 --> 02:57:24,450
That's fine.

3541
02:57:26,090 --> 02:57:26,770
That's fine.

3542
02:57:26,770 --> 02:57:27,870
That's why I got you.

3543
02:57:28,010 --> 02:57:28,930
Take the bubble!

3544
02:57:29,270 --> 02:57:29,930
Oh, he couldn't.

3545
02:57:30,090 --> 02:57:30,830
He didn't take the bubble.

3546
02:57:31,430 --> 02:57:34,050
It's okay, I reloaded a little.

3547
02:57:39,850 --> 02:57:40,370
Fine.

3548
02:57:43,010 --> 02:57:43,830
He doesn't know.

3549
02:57:59,170 --> 02:58:00,990
I had to flee!

3550
02:58:04,450 --> 02:58:05,850
I just kept...

3551
02:58:06,850 --> 02:58:09,750
Oh my god, he had to get his friend to help.

3552
02:58:11,210 --> 02:58:14,330
He had to get another support to help him.

3553
02:58:15,650 --> 02:58:17,070
That's insane.

3554
02:58:18,650 --> 02:58:20,290
That's so stupid.

3555
02:58:20,890 --> 02:58:22,870
Oh my god, I love Jeff.

3556
02:58:23,750 --> 02:58:24,850
His name...

3557
02:58:26,030 --> 02:58:26,330
What?

3558
02:58:26,630 --> 02:58:27,530
What happened?

3559
02:58:29,470 --> 02:58:30,410
What happened?

3560
02:58:33,510 --> 02:58:34,210
That's what...

3561
02:58:34,210 --> 02:58:34,650
Okay.

3562
02:58:35,110 --> 02:58:35,510
Okay.

3563
02:58:37,010 --> 02:58:37,670
Jeff...

3564
02:58:37,670 --> 02:58:39,850
Jeff was not feeling it that time.

3565
02:58:40,310 --> 02:58:42,050
He was not feeling it.

3566
02:58:42,770 --> 02:58:44,310
But don't worry, Jeff is coming over.

3567
02:58:45,610 --> 02:58:47,850
Oh, Jeff is coming over.

3568
02:58:54,320 --> 02:58:56,020
Oh, he died in my mouth.

3569
02:58:56,500 --> 02:58:57,140
He died.

3570
02:59:02,070 --> 02:59:03,270
I'm sorry.

3571
02:59:03,730 --> 02:59:05,010
I'm so sorry.

3572
02:59:12,980 --> 02:59:15,080
It's okay, we still win.

3573
02:59:16,060 --> 02:59:16,740
Whoops.

3574
02:59:17,580 --> 02:59:18,260
Whoops.

3575
02:59:18,760 --> 02:59:19,260
I'm sorry.

3576
02:59:21,260 --> 02:59:24,580
I think the worst part is that I griefed my other support player.

3577
02:59:28,460 --> 02:59:29,900
It was worth it.

3578
02:59:30,380 --> 02:59:31,700
It was worth it.

3579
02:59:32,140 --> 02:59:32,880
If I can't...

3580
02:59:34,040 --> 02:59:39,400
If I couldn't spit out the other guy, I'll spit somebody else out.

3581
02:59:40,640 --> 02:59:43,980
There can only be one support.

3582
02:59:46,380 --> 02:59:47,160
KD!

3583
02:59:47,980 --> 02:59:48,740
No!

3584
02:59:50,920 --> 02:59:51,940
We still won.

3585
02:59:52,420 --> 02:59:54,280
We still won though, guys.

3586
02:59:55,360 --> 02:59:57,060
We did it, everybody.

3587
02:59:58,880 --> 03:00:00,420
Someone's gotta get spit.

3588
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:02,400
Someone's gotta get spat out.

3589
03:00:02,880 --> 03:00:05,960
Oh my god, it's gonna be fucking forever until I get to level 10.

3590
03:00:07,180 --> 03:00:07,780
Yay!

3591
03:00:11,540 --> 03:00:12,140
Yippee!

3592
03:00:15,720 --> 03:00:17,740
Okay, I think Jeff is...

3593
03:00:17,740 --> 03:00:23,300
Honestly, of all the new characters, Jeff is the most fun one out of all of them.

3594
03:00:24,780 --> 03:00:25,340
I find.

3595
03:00:29,120 --> 03:00:31,220
Why is that friendly fire?

3596
03:00:32,480 --> 03:00:34,300
It's cause it's fall damage.

3597
03:00:35,120 --> 03:00:36,820
It was an accident, guys.

3598
03:00:37,520 --> 03:00:38,180
An accident.

3599
03:00:38,440 --> 03:00:39,480
Alright, let's...

3600
03:00:40,920 --> 03:00:42,200
Let's be Squirrel Girl again.

3601
03:00:42,320 --> 03:00:43,400
I think Squirrel Girl is fun.

3602
03:00:44,400 --> 03:00:46,280
Literally all I did was just throw nuts.

3603
03:00:47,660 --> 03:00:49,240
Can use as an ability without cooldown once.

3604
03:00:49,600 --> 03:00:55,540
Reload burst acorns and can use an ability without cooldown once.

3605
03:00:55,600 --> 03:00:56,300
What's burst acorn?

3606
03:00:56,300 --> 03:00:57,860
Oh, it reloads this for me.

3607
03:00:57,980 --> 03:00:58,380
Oh!

3608
03:00:59,160 --> 03:00:59,600
Okay.

3609
03:01:01,860 --> 03:01:02,460
Unleash.

3610
03:01:03,360 --> 03:01:03,960
Guards.

3611
03:01:04,540 --> 03:01:05,840
Imprisoning the first one.

3612
03:01:06,940 --> 03:01:08,220
Now it's back to Squirrel Girl.

3613
03:01:09,140 --> 03:01:11,220
I think all the new characters are really fun.

3614
03:01:11,780 --> 03:01:16,380
But the only main concern is that I don't like how majority of the new characters...

3615
03:01:19,340 --> 03:01:22,040
Majority of the new characters are melee based.

3616
03:01:22,520 --> 03:01:26,140
That's the only thing I'm not like...

3617
03:01:26,140 --> 03:01:29,640
Like, I'm not like really a fan of.

3618
03:01:33,180 --> 03:01:33,720
Let's see.

3619
03:01:34,020 --> 03:01:34,580
That's... Okay.

3620
03:01:34,860 --> 03:01:36,220
I just need to figure out my cooldowns.

3621
03:01:37,140 --> 03:01:37,940
It's time.

3622
03:01:43,220 --> 03:01:44,420
I don't need more melee.

3623
03:01:44,820 --> 03:01:45,980
I just need a pew-pew.

3624
03:01:47,780 --> 03:01:49,160
Strongest hero in the world.

3625
03:01:51,840 --> 03:01:52,720
Oh, it's defense.

3626
03:01:52,960 --> 03:01:55,280
I feel like I've been playing defense so much.

3627
03:01:58,580 --> 03:02:00,120
Who's your favorite to play so far?

3628
03:02:00,700 --> 03:02:03,260
I think if I want to win, it's...

3629
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:06,380
I won't say he's like the most fun.

3630
03:02:06,680 --> 03:02:10,120
It's like, if I want to... WHAT THE FUCK?!

3631
03:02:12,540 --> 03:02:15,620
If I want to win, I have to play Punisher.

3632
03:02:16,020 --> 03:02:17,080
That's really it.

3633
03:02:21,830 --> 03:02:23,290
Oh my god.

3634
03:02:23,610 --> 03:02:25,690
Bro, he just jumps away from my acorns!

3635
03:02:30,290 --> 03:02:31,190
There we go.

3636
03:02:32,270 --> 03:02:33,270
Nice, I trapped somebody.

3637
03:02:34,270 --> 03:02:38,050
I think fun-wise, I actually really enjoy...

3638
03:02:38,050 --> 03:02:40,610
I really enjoy...

3639
03:02:40,610 --> 03:02:42,050
Oh my god.

3640
03:02:42,970 --> 03:02:43,290
Jeff.

3641
03:02:43,850 --> 03:02:45,790
Jeff is actually...

3642
03:02:45,790 --> 03:02:51,830
Jeff is the most fun, but if I want to win, I play Luna Snow and Punisher.

3643
03:02:54,750 --> 03:02:56,030
I think...

3644
03:02:56,030 --> 03:02:57,070
Okay, nice.

3645
03:02:57,690 --> 03:02:58,870
Get another one!

3646
03:03:00,390 --> 03:03:01,610
Nice, I imprisoned one!

3647
03:03:02,150 --> 03:03:02,910
Let's go!

3648
03:03:05,950 --> 03:03:06,590
There we go.

3649
03:03:07,070 --> 03:03:09,190
Literally, all I have to do is just do this in the corner.

3650
03:03:09,930 --> 03:03:11,150
That's all I have to do.

3651
03:03:11,710 --> 03:03:14,890
And then I can get high ground here and then do this in the corner too.

3652
03:03:17,770 --> 03:03:19,150
What are you gonna do, fucking...

3653
03:03:20,110 --> 03:03:21,910
What are you gonna do, dodge it?

3654
03:03:24,410 --> 03:03:26,550
That's right, you can't do jack shit.

3655
03:03:26,550 --> 03:03:27,690
Oh my god.

3656
03:03:27,910 --> 03:03:30,430
Quick, he's... Oh shit, he's angry!

3657
03:03:30,930 --> 03:03:31,810
He's so angry!

3658
03:03:34,330 --> 03:03:37,230
Somebody stop him, he's so fucking mad!

3659
03:03:38,930 --> 03:03:40,670
Oh my god, we stopped him.

3660
03:03:41,350 --> 03:03:42,550
Bro, they're all melee!

3661
03:03:45,450 --> 03:03:46,790
They're all melee!

3662
03:03:47,930 --> 03:03:49,330
What do we do?

3663
03:03:51,570 --> 03:03:53,710
What do we do when they're all melee?

3664
03:03:58,030 --> 03:03:59,470
Guys, please!

3665
03:04:06,680 --> 03:04:07,400
Please!

3666
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:08,780
Where's my team?

3667
03:04:08,960 --> 03:04:10,940
I've stayed alive for so long!

3668
03:04:15,240 --> 03:04:18,720
Oh my god, how am I still alive?

3669
03:04:19,220 --> 03:04:21,780
Movement, literally movement.

3670
03:04:25,200 --> 03:04:28,760
I literally movement the shit out of all of them, that was crazy.

3671
03:04:32,940 --> 03:04:35,500
It was just a pow- oh no, he's so mad.

3672
03:04:35,840 --> 03:04:37,560
He's actually so mad.

3673
03:04:37,740 --> 03:04:41,760
Oh my god.

3674
03:04:45,260 --> 03:04:48,940
I had like- so like, her ability is that she can...

3675
03:04:50,960 --> 03:04:52,940
Jesus Christ, what the fuck?!

3676
03:04:56,880 --> 03:04:58,940
Oh my god, the angry...

3677
03:05:01,400 --> 03:05:03,240
Oh no, is it time?

3678
03:05:04,520 --> 03:05:05,440
Is it time?

3679
03:05:05,580 --> 03:05:06,560
Do I wanna win?

3680
03:05:06,880 --> 03:05:13,200
Is it I wanna win time, guys?

3681
03:05:13,980 --> 03:05:15,120
Guys, I think...

3682
03:05:16,420 --> 03:05:19,400
Guys, I think it's I wanna win time.

3683
03:05:22,260 --> 03:05:23,220
I think...

3684
03:05:24,760 --> 03:05:27,460
I think it's I really wanna win.

3685
03:05:32,890 --> 03:05:34,370
I think it's time.

3686
03:05:35,650 --> 03:05:38,090
I really, really wanna win.

3687
03:05:41,050 --> 03:05:41,650
Okay.

3688
03:05:46,360 --> 03:05:49,320
Oh my god, I have to die though if I wanna do what I wanna do.

3689
03:05:51,660 --> 03:05:52,260
Please!

3690
03:05:56,250 --> 03:05:58,450
Please, I'm trying so hard!

3691
03:06:01,190 --> 03:06:02,250
Thank god!

3692
03:06:05,750 --> 03:06:07,150
Just run in!

3693
03:06:07,850 --> 03:06:09,570
Run in, my squirrels!

3694
03:06:11,370 --> 03:06:12,090
Nice.

3695
03:06:15,410 --> 03:06:16,350
Oh god.

3696
03:06:17,250 --> 03:06:19,430
Oh god, I am trying my best.

3697
03:06:23,430 --> 03:06:24,750
Oh my god, nice!

3698
03:06:28,250 --> 03:06:30,230
I'm literally- I'm just chucking!

3699
03:06:30,410 --> 03:06:32,130
I'm chucking squirrels!

3700
03:06:32,890 --> 03:06:35,290
All I do is chuck squirrels!

3701
03:06:38,410 --> 03:06:41,190
I haven't stopped chucking!

3702
03:06:46,620 --> 03:06:47,880
Okay, nice.

3703
03:06:48,740 --> 03:06:51,200
I haven't stopped chuck- Oh, fuck!

3704
03:06:51,580 --> 03:06:52,460
Angry Canadian!

3705
03:06:55,560 --> 03:06:56,280
I lived!

3706
03:06:59,320 --> 03:07:01,020
I don't know how!

3707
03:07:01,440 --> 03:07:04,920
I don't know how I- Oh my god.

3708
03:07:05,400 --> 03:07:06,800
How the fuck?

3709
03:07:08,400 --> 03:07:08,780
Please!

3710
03:07:10,880 --> 03:07:13,080
It's okay, we beat the angry Canadian.

3711
03:07:13,680 --> 03:07:15,760
We beat myself, technically.

3712
03:07:18,160 --> 03:07:19,380
What the fuck?

3713
03:07:19,440 --> 03:07:20,820
Oh, it's the Venom power-up.

3714
03:07:21,240 --> 03:07:22,920
My god, please!

3715
03:07:23,060 --> 03:07:23,900
Alright, it's time.

3716
03:07:25,260 --> 03:07:26,320
It's time.

3717
03:07:30,320 --> 03:07:31,300
It's time.

3718
03:07:31,540 --> 03:07:33,640
It's time to actually try to win.

3719
03:07:33,640 --> 03:07:36,140
The squirrel hunts the wolverine.

3720
03:07:36,360 --> 03:07:37,520
Frank, thank you for the superchat.

3721
03:07:37,560 --> 03:07:38,500
Thank you.

3722
03:07:43,750 --> 03:07:46,070
That's right, what are you gonna do with your fucking fists?

3723
03:07:49,730 --> 03:07:53,130
What are you fucking gonna do with your fucking fists?

3724
03:07:55,790 --> 03:07:57,330
Alright, this is it.

3725
03:07:58,090 --> 03:08:01,450
Because they have so many melee characters, this is literally the perfect time.

3726
03:08:06,440 --> 03:08:07,660
Bro, what the fuck?

3727
03:08:08,300 --> 03:08:09,300
What the fuck?

3728
03:08:13,660 --> 03:08:14,300
Where is he?

3729
03:08:18,130 --> 03:08:20,400
Where is- Okay!

3730
03:08:20,820 --> 03:08:24,560
As I told you guys, if I wanna win...

3731
03:08:24,560 --> 03:08:29,560
If I- If I wanna win, this is what I have to do.

3732
03:08:29,860 --> 03:08:32,200
This is what I have to do.

3733
03:08:34,380 --> 03:08:36,660
This is the- What the fuck?

3734
03:08:39,320 --> 03:08:41,180
Bro, the venom shit?

3735
03:08:42,600 --> 03:08:43,960
He's so low!

3736
03:08:45,100 --> 03:08:46,640
If I wanna win, it's Cod.

3737
03:08:53,620 --> 03:08:54,020
Yep.

3738
03:08:56,480 --> 03:08:56,880
Yep.

3739
03:09:01,160 --> 03:09:01,960
Yep.

3740
03:09:07,660 --> 03:09:08,460
Yep.

3741
03:09:10,640 --> 03:09:12,040
I cast gun.

3742
03:09:13,340 --> 03:09:16,600
They wanna

3743
03:09:19,890 --> 03:09:20,810
use their fists?

3744
03:09:21,390 --> 03:09:22,390
I bring gun.

3745
03:09:24,030 --> 03:09:24,910
Oh shit!

3746
03:09:25,430 --> 03:09:27,530
There's two- They two of them fisted!

3747
03:09:28,090 --> 03:09:32,770
The most powerful spell of all time.

3748
03:09:37,050 --> 03:09:37,710
Exactly.

3749
03:09:38,270 --> 03:09:40,090
All I have to do is just shoot.

3750
03:09:40,750 --> 03:09:44,210
And then if they get too close, I have a turret.

3751
03:09:46,250 --> 03:10:00,670
The only- The only reason- Honestly, the only reason they won that fight was literally because- Was literally because two of them started hitting me.

3752
03:10:07,580 --> 03:10:08,820
Bro, stop!

3753
03:10:09,660 --> 03:10:10,280
Stop!

3754
03:10:11,660 --> 03:10:17,740
Fucking- Oh shit, I'm born again.

3755
03:10:18,020 --> 03:10:19,040
Let's go.

3756
03:10:22,750 --> 03:10:23,670
He's one.

3757
03:10:24,690 --> 03:10:25,090
Please.

3758
03:10:26,110 --> 03:10:28,770
This guy is so fucking fast though.

3759
03:10:28,790 --> 03:10:29,530
He's really good.

3760
03:10:30,410 --> 03:10:31,330
Oh my god, please.

3761
03:10:31,510 --> 03:10:33,070
I really need heals though.

3762
03:10:33,830 --> 03:10:35,570
Oh my god, where's the heal pack?

3763
03:10:36,730 --> 03:10:37,410
Please.

3764
03:10:41,270 --> 03:10:42,970
I'm trying so hard to help you.

3765
03:10:43,730 --> 03:10:45,350
I have no HP.

3766
03:10:47,450 --> 03:10:49,010
Oh my god, thank god.

3767
03:10:49,530 --> 03:10:50,470
Please, no!

3768
03:10:50,790 --> 03:10:53,650
I lived for so long!

3769
03:10:54,090 --> 03:10:57,230
And it's fire and does 200 flips!

3770
03:10:59,230 --> 03:11:01,790
I actually lived for so long!

3771
03:11:06,110 --> 03:11:08,050
All I needed was heals!

3772
03:11:17,190 --> 03:11:18,610
Oh my god.

3773
03:11:19,290 --> 03:11:20,370
Oh my god.

3774
03:11:20,510 --> 03:11:21,950
I gotta live though.

3775
03:11:23,830 --> 03:11:24,470
No!

3776
03:11:26,430 --> 03:11:27,070
No!

3777
03:11:27,810 --> 03:11:32,510
It's all- I'm so close to my ult!

3778
03:11:36,450 --> 03:11:38,190
I don't think I got heals during the last fight.

3779
03:11:38,430 --> 03:11:39,830
I don't- I don't think.

3780
03:11:46,330 --> 03:11:46,830
Heals.

3781
03:11:47,290 --> 03:11:48,070
My heals.

3782
03:11:48,470 --> 03:11:50,430
My heals left the chat.

3783
03:11:50,430 --> 03:11:52,470
I just need it.

3784
03:11:52,510 --> 03:11:53,990
Spare me some heals.

3785
03:11:54,810 --> 03:11:58,370
Spare me some heals, everyone, please.

3786
03:11:58,930 --> 03:12:01,050
Just a little morsel.

3787
03:12:06,290 --> 03:12:08,870
Just a crumb.

3788
03:12:10,690 --> 03:12:12,530
Just a fucking crumb.

3789
03:12:14,310 --> 03:12:16,470
I wish Punisher has heals.

3790
03:12:17,990 --> 03:12:19,430
No heals.

3791
03:12:19,430 --> 03:12:20,870
No heals.

3792
03:12:26,190 --> 03:12:27,230
Alright, let's see.

3793
03:12:27,330 --> 03:12:28,710
What have I not played yet?

3794
03:12:30,530 --> 03:12:31,010
Um...

3795
03:12:31,010 --> 03:12:33,150
I never really liked Scarlet Witch.

3796
03:12:33,250 --> 03:12:36,050
I know she- Like, I know she's her- Her ult is like a D.Va mom.

3797
03:12:36,510 --> 03:12:37,770
But I've never really liked it.

3798
03:12:38,630 --> 03:12:41,390
It's not- Honestly, it's not my favorite.

3799
03:12:42,630 --> 03:12:45,530
Fucking Cloak and Dagger confused the shit out of me.

3800
03:12:48,050 --> 03:12:50,070
Oh, we don't have a tank, but that's okay.

3801
03:12:55,440 --> 03:12:57,260
Oh yeah, we can try Moon Knight!

3802
03:12:57,580 --> 03:12:59,260
Wait, I forgot about him!

3803
03:13:02,060 --> 03:13:03,700
Wait, I want- We don't need a healer.

3804
03:13:05,300 --> 03:13:09,980
Alright, how do I play- How do I play- How do I play Moon Batman- Moon Man?

3805
03:13:11,860 --> 03:13:18,700
Open a portal that allows us to bombard and enter a gliding state and to knock enemies when airborne towards the center.

3806
03:13:19,220 --> 03:13:24,900
Launch a front grapple that pulls- Okay, perform a combo with his and the third strike will slightly launch the enemy.

3807
03:13:25,500 --> 03:13:28,840
Perform a double jump- Launch that can bounce between- Okay.

3808
03:13:32,770 --> 03:13:33,290
Alright.

3809
03:13:33,990 --> 03:13:34,510
Just that.

3810
03:13:36,310 --> 03:13:37,690
What does that do again?

3811
03:13:38,230 --> 03:13:39,370
What does the E do?

3812
03:13:40,310 --> 03:13:42,910
To knock enemies when- Oh, it knocks people.

3813
03:13:43,170 --> 03:13:44,010
Oh, okay.

3814
03:13:51,030 --> 03:13:54,770
What the- Holy shit, what?

3815
03:13:55,770 --> 03:13:56,370
Wait.

3816
03:13:59,250 --> 03:14:01,290
Jesus, what?

3817
03:14:02,830 --> 03:14:05,030
What is this DPS?

3818
03:14:07,110 --> 03:14:08,910
Wait, that's crazy.

3819
03:14:10,590 --> 03:14:12,550
What the fuck?

3820
03:14:13,410 --> 03:14:17,130
What is this fucking DPS there?

3821
03:14:23,930 --> 03:14:26,650
His DPS is actually crazy, not gonna lie.

3822
03:14:26,910 --> 03:14:29,430
I'm gonna- Look at that!

3823
03:14:36,550 --> 03:14:39,430
Okay, I think- I think his DPS is a little broken.

3824
03:14:40,170 --> 03:14:45,170
I legitimately think it is a little bit- Like, what am I doing?

3825
03:14:45,730 --> 03:14:46,770
What am I doing?

3826
03:14:51,430 --> 03:14:54,290
Just Moon- Run, you bullshit bitch!

3827
03:14:54,290 --> 03:14:54,990
Let's go!

3828
03:14:57,430 --> 03:14:58,890
Let's fucking go!

3829
03:14:59,070 --> 03:14:59,930
I love random

3830
03:15:04,180 --> 03:15:04,780
damage!

3831
03:15:05,380 --> 03:15:06,980
Jesus Christ!

3832
03:15:09,440 --> 03:15:12,340
That's actually crazy, I already did 2000 damage.

3833
03:15:16,320 --> 03:15:18,640
The only bad thing is that I definitely need heals.

3834
03:15:21,060 --> 03:15:23,020
It's just like the memes!

3835
03:15:23,680 --> 03:15:25,540
I love random bullshit!

3836
03:15:26,420 --> 03:15:31,960
He's kinda like a glass cannon, but like- If I get pocketed, it's actually crazy.

3837
03:15:32,540 --> 03:15:35,040
It's actually crazy how strong he is.

3838
03:15:36,820 --> 03:15:38,380
Wait, how do I use his ult though?

3839
03:15:41,360 --> 03:15:42,260
Oh god.

3840
03:15:44,960 --> 03:15:45,860
That's right!

3841
03:15:46,300 --> 03:15:47,780
With the power of the moon!

3842
03:15:51,460 --> 03:15:53,820
I still don't really understand the E though.

3843
03:15:55,820 --> 03:15:58,520
He's got the same health as Jeff.

3844
03:16:01,960 --> 03:16:02,880
I need help.

3845
03:16:03,060 --> 03:16:04,400
What does the E actually do?

3846
03:16:04,620 --> 03:16:06,800
Like, what does it do?

3847
03:16:11,280 --> 03:16:11,560
Okay.

3848
03:16:12,660 --> 03:16:13,460
That's fine.

3849
03:16:13,760 --> 03:16:15,460
He's almost dead, but he's getting heals.

3850
03:16:17,360 --> 03:16:19,140
You attack it so it will- Oh!

3851
03:16:20,720 --> 03:16:23,040
Wait, oh my god, wait!

3852
03:16:23,040 --> 03:16:25,080
It's like a geometry!

3853
03:16:25,920 --> 03:16:27,040
Simple geometry!

3854
03:16:27,420 --> 03:16:30,080
Oh god, I'm sorry, I was figuring out- Yeah.

3855
03:16:30,700 --> 03:16:34,800
Oh my god, I- Oh my god, it's like simple geometry!

3856
03:16:41,360 --> 03:16:41,960
Shapes!

3857
03:16:43,760 --> 03:16:47,020
Oh my god, it's like fucking shapes, guys!

3858
03:16:52,080 --> 03:16:53,280
Jesus Christ.

3859
03:16:54,880 --> 03:16:58,820
I don't think this is- This does not look fair.

3860
03:17:12,800 --> 03:17:14,800
That's a good girl!

3861
03:17:17,500 --> 03:17:19,140
Maybe you're better than Batman.

3862
03:17:19,700 --> 03:17:20,600
He's straight!

3863
03:17:21,120 --> 03:17:24,020
Wait, why have I not been playing him this entire time?

3864
03:17:29,640 --> 03:17:30,920
Woo!

3865
03:17:31,400 --> 03:17:32,260
Shapes!

3866
03:17:33,100 --> 03:17:35,160
I love shapes!

3867
03:17:41,480 --> 03:17:42,760
Shapes!

3868
03:17:43,920 --> 03:17:45,200
Shapes!

3869
03:17:48,500 --> 03:17:51,500
Jesus Christ, this is so dumb.

3870
03:17:52,000 --> 03:17:54,260
This is actually so dumb.

3871
03:17:57,400 --> 03:17:58,680
Okay.

3872
03:18:01,220 --> 03:18:02,040
We're fine.

3873
03:18:02,960 --> 03:18:04,300
We got shapes here.

3874
03:18:04,860 --> 03:18:07,240
I literally am just throwing shapes down here.

3875
03:18:07,420 --> 03:18:10,600
I'm just throwing shapes and killing people down here.

3876
03:18:10,840 --> 03:18:11,420
Easy.

3877
03:18:14,060 --> 03:18:15,260
Oh shit.

3878
03:18:17,060 --> 03:18:18,460
Don't make me throw a shape!

3879
03:18:18,660 --> 03:18:19,800
I'm gonna do it!

3880
03:18:20,540 --> 03:18:21,940
I'm gonna fucking do it!

3881
03:18:22,280 --> 03:18:23,300
You know I can!

3882
03:18:25,280 --> 03:18:27,200
I'm gonna fucking throw geometry in here!

3883
03:18:29,520 --> 03:18:30,920
That's crazy.

3884
03:18:35,580 --> 03:18:38,440
I think I found my favorite character.

3885
03:18:40,560 --> 03:18:42,160
Don't make me pull a shape!

3886
03:18:43,980 --> 03:18:46,640
Don't fucking- Oh shit!

3887
03:18:47,020 --> 03:18:50,220
I was gonna say, fucking easy with it.

3888
03:18:52,360 --> 03:18:53,900
That's right, moon time.

3889
03:18:56,600 --> 03:18:58,200
That's right, it's moon time!

3890
03:19:00,120 --> 03:19:01,720
Oh, I messed up the shape though.

3891
03:19:02,380 --> 03:19:03,160
Get closer!

3892
03:19:03,400 --> 03:19:04,440
Get closer to my shape!

3893
03:19:07,500 --> 03:19:07,980
Okay.

3894
03:19:08,540 --> 03:19:10,020
Guys, I need you guys to get closer.

3895
03:19:14,490 --> 03:19:16,150
Guys, I need you guys to get closer.

3896
03:19:19,190 --> 03:19:19,510
Come on!

3897
03:19:20,150 --> 03:19:21,190
He's so low!

3898
03:19:21,250 --> 03:19:22,290
He's so low!

3899
03:19:24,930 --> 03:19:26,110
Is he okay down there?

3900
03:19:26,910 --> 03:19:27,590
Ow.

3901
03:19:29,070 --> 03:19:30,750
I'm so tired.

3902
03:19:31,990 --> 03:19:34,250
You look so tired.

3903
03:19:34,870 --> 03:19:36,450
I am so tired.

3904
03:19:37,070 --> 03:19:38,770
It's okay, I'll throw shapes down here.

3905
03:19:41,010 --> 03:19:41,310
Okay.

3906
03:19:42,750 --> 03:19:43,370
Shape time!

3907
03:19:44,110 --> 03:19:44,850
Where's my shape?

3908
03:19:45,890 --> 03:19:46,870
Shape time!

3909
03:19:47,530 --> 03:19:48,470
That's right, stand here!

3910
03:19:51,890 --> 03:19:52,550
Nice.

3911
03:19:53,030 --> 03:19:54,710
Damn, how did you know?

3912
03:19:57,510 --> 03:19:58,150
Yay!

3913
03:20:07,100 --> 03:20:08,380
You know...

3914
03:20:08,380 --> 03:20:09,460
You know...

3915
03:20:09,460 --> 03:20:12,060
I should've been playing him in the beginning, not gonna lie.

3916
03:20:12,220 --> 03:20:12,560
I...

3917
03:20:12,560 --> 03:20:14,880
I feel like...

3918
03:20:14,880 --> 03:20:15,660
Oh, yeah!

3919
03:20:16,380 --> 03:20:17,020
I...

3920
03:20:17,020 --> 03:20:18,900
Oh, yeah, 100%!

3921
03:20:19,400 --> 03:20:23,380
Maybe I should've played him at the very start, like, not gonna lie.

3922
03:20:23,900 --> 03:20:25,200
I think, like, we know...

3923
03:20:27,820 --> 03:20:30,940
I think we know who's the best character here.

3924
03:20:30,940 --> 03:20:33,080
I think he's, like, super squishy.

3925
03:20:33,800 --> 03:20:34,420
But...

3926
03:20:34,420 --> 03:20:37,060
His DPS is actually insane.

3927
03:20:37,220 --> 03:20:38,140
His DPS...

3928
03:20:39,560 --> 03:20:42,520
The DPS is fucking crazy.

3929
03:20:42,680 --> 03:20:44,320
I, like, fucking threw one...

3930
03:20:44,320 --> 03:20:47,160
One shape at them, and then it was like...

3931
03:20:47,880 --> 03:20:48,260
No!

3932
03:20:48,940 --> 03:20:49,880
My shape!

3933
03:20:51,380 --> 03:20:52,960
No, shape man!

3934
03:20:53,880 --> 03:20:54,280
No!

3935
03:20:57,520 --> 03:21:02,500
What do I do when I can't play shape man?

3936
03:21:03,740 --> 03:21:05,600
What can I do?

3937
03:21:06,840 --> 03:21:07,320
No!

3938
03:21:09,380 --> 03:21:09,940
No!

3939
03:21:11,040 --> 03:21:12,740
I can't be a moon!

3940
03:21:14,780 --> 03:21:15,340
I don't know.

3941
03:21:16,380 --> 03:21:18,560
I don't know what to do when I can't play that.

3942
03:21:18,740 --> 03:21:19,760
It's time for Widowmaker.

3943
03:21:21,060 --> 03:21:22,260
They took all our shapes.

3944
03:21:24,280 --> 03:21:25,420
Oh shit, nice!

3945
03:21:25,800 --> 03:21:28,300
We can wall toge- We can shoot the targets!

3946
03:21:32,440 --> 03:21:34,480
What is the world without shape?

3947
03:21:34,560 --> 03:21:35,080
Exactly!

3948
03:21:36,880 --> 03:21:39,220
There's one reason why I love playing Widowmaker.

3949
03:21:39,760 --> 03:21:43,680
No, there's two reasons why I like playing Black Widow.

3950
03:21:54,590 --> 03:21:55,190
Guys...

3951
03:21:56,810 --> 03:21:58,190
Guys, I need help.

3952
03:22:03,420 --> 03:22:04,440
Please, he's one!

3953
03:22:09,310 --> 03:22:10,470
Please, he's solo!

3954
03:22:14,740 --> 03:22:15,260
Nice!

3955
03:22:20,800 --> 03:22:21,520
Come on, peek me!

3956
03:22:23,940 --> 03:22:24,920
That's not fair.

3957
03:22:25,600 --> 03:22:26,940
That's fucking right, bitch.

3958
03:22:27,040 --> 03:22:27,300
No!

3959
03:22:28,900 --> 03:22:31,160
Please, I got three solo kills!

3960
03:22:34,740 --> 03:22:35,260
Please!

3961
03:22:35,900 --> 03:22:38,400
Oh my god, that was such a carry!

3962
03:22:38,400 --> 03:22:38,500
Three!

3963
03:22:43,220 --> 03:22:47,540
But yeah, I love Black Widow for two main reasons.

3964
03:22:49,280 --> 03:22:51,360
Two big main reasons.

3965
03:22:59,100 --> 03:22:59,780
Guys!

3966
03:23:00,080 --> 03:23:01,060
Guys, no!

3967
03:23:01,640 --> 03:23:03,060
You can just do that?

3968
03:23:07,540 --> 03:23:09,760
Oh my god, Jesus Christ.

3969
03:23:09,880 --> 03:23:11,000
That shit's insane.

3970
03:23:12,860 --> 03:23:14,220
You can just walk up to me.

3971
03:23:16,720 --> 03:23:17,960
I got rushed so hard.

3972
03:23:21,530 --> 03:23:22,670
Hey, Hawkeye.

3973
03:23:23,330 --> 03:23:24,470
You like, help?

3974
03:23:25,150 --> 03:23:26,410
But like, I don't know.

3975
03:23:26,610 --> 03:23:28,390
I don't know if you know what that means.

3976
03:23:29,850 --> 03:23:30,410
Okay.

3977
03:23:33,750 --> 03:23:34,570
He's one.

3978
03:23:34,850 --> 03:23:36,030
Please, he's solo.

3979
03:23:37,090 --> 03:23:38,010
Are you serious?

3980
03:23:38,190 --> 03:23:39,290
He's so low!

3981
03:23:39,430 --> 03:23:40,530
He's so bad!

3982
03:23:44,220 --> 03:23:45,580
No, I didn't mean that!

3983
03:23:45,820 --> 03:23:46,940
I was just joking!

3984
03:23:47,200 --> 03:23:48,400
I was joking, guys!

3985
03:23:48,400 --> 03:23:51,040
Guys, please turn around!

3986
03:23:54,460 --> 03:23:57,540
Okay, that's actually like...

3987
03:23:58,160 --> 03:24:03,540
They let him do that?!

3988
03:24:05,200 --> 03:24:07,120
I hate my...

3989
03:24:07,120 --> 03:24:09,540
My team didn't even help me!

3990
03:24:09,960 --> 03:24:12,180
That's actually crazy!

3991
03:24:12,920 --> 03:24:14,680
My team ignored...

3992
03:24:14,680 --> 03:24:15,780
That's actually crazy!

3993
03:24:16,560 --> 03:24:18,200
Holy fuck!

3994
03:24:23,440 --> 03:24:24,320
Oh my god.

3995
03:24:27,360 --> 03:24:28,960
Jesus Christ.

3996
03:24:29,760 --> 03:24:31,420
Like, I'm mad.

3997
03:24:31,580 --> 03:24:32,280
That's it.

3998
03:24:32,680 --> 03:24:33,940
That's fucking it.

3999
03:24:34,200 --> 03:24:34,920
It's time.

4000
03:24:35,900 --> 03:24:37,020
It's fucking time.

4001
03:24:37,300 --> 03:24:38,900
I'm so mad at my team.

4002
03:24:42,360 --> 03:24:43,960
That's fucking it.

4003
03:24:46,120 --> 03:24:47,020
They took...

4004
03:24:47,020 --> 03:24:48,680
Wait, I can play Moonman!

4005
03:24:49,580 --> 03:24:52,020
I'm gonna play Moonman after this.

4006
03:24:52,020 --> 03:24:54,760
I'm gonna play Moonman.

4007
03:24:57,780 --> 03:24:59,340
No more.

4008
03:24:59,980 --> 03:25:01,380
I'm not...

4009
03:25:02,580 --> 03:25:05,640
I'm not fucking around anymore.

4010
03:25:12,450 --> 03:25:15,170
I'm not fucking around no more.

4011
03:25:19,280 --> 03:25:21,860
Did you guys all leave the point?!

4012
03:25:22,940 --> 03:25:23,940
What?!

4013
03:25:26,520 --> 03:25:28,580
Oh my god!

4014
03:25:28,580 --> 03:25:30,880
How did you all leave the point?!

4015
03:25:31,220 --> 03:25:32,340
Holy shit!

4016
03:25:32,820 --> 03:25:34,280
How the fuck?!

4017
03:25:34,280 --> 03:25:35,400
Oh my god!

4018
03:25:35,960 --> 03:25:36,360
Okay.

4019
03:25:37,380 --> 03:25:38,960
I'm fucking...

4020
03:25:39,580 --> 03:25:41,640
I'm not playing around no more.

4021
03:25:42,060 --> 03:25:44,840
I'm not playing around no more.

4022
03:25:46,200 --> 03:25:47,360
I have no team.

4023
03:25:47,660 --> 03:25:49,240
I am the darkness.

4024
03:25:49,640 --> 03:25:51,200
This is my...

4025
03:25:51,200 --> 03:25:53,900
This is my Joker arc right here.

4026
03:25:55,640 --> 03:25:58,020
I still can't believe...

4027
03:25:58,020 --> 03:26:00,320
He fucking ran past...

4028
03:26:00,320 --> 03:26:02,320
My entire team!

4029
03:26:02,860 --> 03:26:04,740
And like my healer...

4030
03:26:04,740 --> 03:26:06,060
Ignored me!

4031
03:26:06,920 --> 03:26:07,840
Like...

4032
03:26:07,840 --> 03:26:11,100
Do you have eyes?

4033
03:26:11,440 --> 03:26:12,740
Oh, his name is Slowpoke.

4034
03:26:13,000 --> 03:26:13,860
He does not.

4035
03:26:14,660 --> 03:26:16,320
He does not.

4036
03:26:17,900 --> 03:26:18,360
Okay.

4037
03:26:19,720 --> 03:26:22,280
He absolutely did not have eyes.

4038
03:26:28,780 --> 03:26:29,820
God.

4039
03:26:36,640 --> 03:26:38,220
Oh my god.

4040
03:26:38,740 --> 03:26:40,640
It's time for random bullshit time.

4041
03:26:44,330 --> 03:26:45,890
Jesus Christ.

4042
03:26:47,050 --> 03:26:48,090
What?!

4043
03:26:48,090 --> 03:26:50,470
Jesus Christ.

4044
03:26:51,050 --> 03:26:53,330
Eventually something's gonna hit.

4045
03:26:54,250 --> 03:26:55,590
That's fucking right.

4046
03:26:58,170 --> 03:26:59,850
That's fucking right.

4047
03:27:04,410 --> 03:27:06,130
I'm fucking angry.

4048
03:27:09,930 --> 03:27:12,310
That's fucking right.

4049
03:27:13,970 --> 03:27:16,050
I'm shaped, man.

4050
03:27:21,610 --> 03:27:24,530
That's fucking right, bitch.

4051
03:27:28,830 --> 03:27:29,850
Light!

4052
03:27:30,430 --> 03:27:32,230
With the power of light!

4053
03:27:34,910 --> 03:27:36,110
And the moon!

4054
03:27:37,210 --> 03:27:38,310
I don't know, that's...

4055
03:27:38,310 --> 03:27:39,610
I think it's a waste, but...

4056
03:27:43,190 --> 03:27:44,070
Nice, okay.

4057
03:27:45,490 --> 03:27:46,290
Where is he?

4058
03:27:50,910 --> 03:27:51,730
Get over here.

4059
03:27:53,610 --> 03:27:54,570
Get over here.

4060
03:27:58,620 --> 03:27:59,380
That's fine.

4061
03:28:00,840 --> 03:28:03,100
Okay, as long as he's not Moonman, that's fine.

4062
03:28:03,220 --> 03:28:04,140
I'm just gonna stay here.

4063
03:28:06,500 --> 03:28:07,520
That's fine.

4064
03:28:10,620 --> 03:28:11,260
It's okay.

4065
03:28:12,300 --> 03:28:13,420
It's fine.

4066
03:28:15,440 --> 03:28:17,100
We just stay back here.

4067
03:28:17,200 --> 03:28:19,140
Oh shit, it's not fine.

4068
03:28:19,320 --> 03:28:20,640
With the power of light!

4069
03:28:23,440 --> 03:28:25,020
Okay, I'm gonna leave.

4070
03:28:25,500 --> 03:28:28,000
I don't...

4071
03:28:28,000 --> 03:28:28,800
Oh no.

4072
03:28:30,620 --> 03:28:31,620
I'm fucking leaving.

4073
03:28:32,540 --> 03:28:33,600
You can have it.

4074
03:28:34,680 --> 03:28:35,880
Holy shit.

4075
03:28:36,420 --> 03:28:38,380
He can have the point.

4076
03:28:44,660 --> 03:28:46,020
Jesus Christ.

4077
03:28:49,120 --> 03:28:51,520
Okay, I'm gonna get rid of his clones real fast though.

4078
03:28:51,980 --> 03:28:53,220
Alright, that's fucking right!

4079
03:28:53,400 --> 03:28:53,960
Get over here!

4080
03:28:55,320 --> 03:28:56,320
Get over here!

4081
03:28:57,680 --> 03:28:58,980
It's shape time!

4082
03:29:01,440 --> 03:29:02,640
Get over here!

4083
03:29:03,080 --> 03:29:04,620
Oh shit, maybe not.

4084
03:29:05,060 --> 03:29:05,880
No way!

4085
03:29:06,880 --> 03:29:08,980
Oh my god, I jumped!

4086
03:29:09,940 --> 03:29:11,800
I fucking jumped!

4087
03:29:12,200 --> 03:29:13,020
Team, please.

4088
03:29:13,800 --> 03:29:15,020
Team, I...

4089
03:29:15,020 --> 03:29:15,980
I really...

4090
03:29:16,800 --> 03:29:18,640
Team, please.

4091
03:29:19,380 --> 03:29:20,360
A little assistance.

4092
03:29:21,120 --> 03:29:23,480
I can't solo at all, guys.

4093
03:29:24,260 --> 03:29:26,660
I know you guys think I can.

4094
03:29:27,100 --> 03:29:29,460
But I don't think I can, guys.

4095
03:29:29,460 --> 03:29:30,040
I...

4096
03:29:33,840 --> 03:29:36,300
Oh my god, I wish...

4097
03:29:36,300 --> 03:29:38,600
I wish I can solo it all.

4098
03:29:42,100 --> 03:29:43,500
Oh no, not Hella.

4099
03:29:47,590 --> 03:29:48,050
It's fine.

4100
03:29:48,270 --> 03:29:49,250
I don't think he realized.

4101
03:29:51,230 --> 03:29:52,010
There we go.

4102
03:29:53,490 --> 03:29:54,850
Oh, I got the moon.

4103
03:29:55,250 --> 03:29:56,470
We got the moon, it's fine.

4104
03:29:57,990 --> 03:29:59,690
We literally got the moon on our side.

4105
03:29:59,690 --> 03:30:01,210
We got shapes and moons.

4106
03:30:02,310 --> 03:30:03,770
We stay here.

4107
03:30:04,430 --> 03:30:06,690
We're the most ultimate shape right here.

4108
03:30:11,030 --> 03:30:12,850
Oh my god, I see him.

4109
03:30:15,490 --> 03:30:16,190
Fuck you!

4110
03:30:16,430 --> 03:30:17,390
That's right!

4111
03:30:17,470 --> 03:30:19,550
I remember what you did!

4112
03:30:20,810 --> 03:30:24,540
I remember what you did!

4113
03:30:27,320 --> 03:30:29,060
That's fucking right!

4114
03:30:29,840 --> 03:30:30,800
Get down!

4115
03:30:32,320 --> 03:30:34,960
There were all the lucky charms at him.

4116
03:30:36,060 --> 03:30:39,020
Oh my god, all I had to be was moon man.

4117
03:30:40,300 --> 03:30:42,960
I know what you did last summer.

4118
03:30:45,620 --> 03:30:47,060
I remember that.

4119
03:30:47,400 --> 03:30:49,060
Wait, I still have to do another objective.

4120
03:30:49,120 --> 03:30:49,840
Oh my god, I forgot.

4121
03:30:50,280 --> 03:30:51,100
I thought I won.

4122
03:30:51,180 --> 03:30:55,000
I was gonna be ready to fucking type in chat and be like, fucking get good.

4123
03:30:59,360 --> 03:31:03,320
I was so ready to type in chat like, GG's gay fucking good.

4124
03:31:04,260 --> 03:31:05,680
You fucking idiot.

4125
03:31:08,580 --> 03:31:10,500
I have better aim, you fucker.

4126
03:31:14,920 --> 03:31:20,580
You just had a better team that would literally protect- that actually defend you.

4127
03:31:20,940 --> 03:31:23,540
My team would rather I fucking die.

4128
03:31:23,720 --> 03:31:24,420
They don't care.

4129
03:31:24,560 --> 03:31:25,700
They don't care about me.

4130
03:31:30,000 --> 03:31:30,520
Whee!

4131
03:31:31,320 --> 03:31:32,740
My team doesn't care.

4132
03:31:33,200 --> 03:31:34,860
They're just like, you're still here?

4133
03:31:35,340 --> 03:31:36,620
I'm like, please guys.

4134
03:31:37,480 --> 03:31:38,000
Please.

4135
03:31:43,220 --> 03:31:43,740
Alright.

4136
03:31:44,880 --> 03:31:45,460
This is it.

4137
03:31:45,700 --> 03:31:49,060
Guys, I have- I'm sort of like, I don't know guys.

4138
03:31:49,180 --> 03:31:51,700
I'm scared that we might not win this, guys.

4139
03:31:55,240 --> 03:31:57,760
Guys, what if we don't win this, guys?

4140
03:32:00,500 --> 03:32:01,860
What if?

4141
03:32:02,560 --> 03:32:04,260
What would I do?

4142
03:32:08,040 --> 03:32:10,200
I don't know what to do.

4143
03:32:12,700 --> 03:32:14,160
What the fuck?

4144
03:32:14,760 --> 03:32:15,940
Get me away from here.

4145
03:32:16,820 --> 03:32:18,000
Oh shit!

4146
03:32:19,120 --> 03:32:20,540
Oh my gosh!

4147
03:32:21,440 --> 03:32:24,060
Hey guys, I really would appreciate...

4148
03:32:28,630 --> 03:32:33,990
If he gets near me, if he gets near me, I swear to god, I'm ready to shape this right now.

4149
03:32:35,950 --> 03:32:36,710
Oh shit!

4150
03:32:36,770 --> 03:32:38,370
I guess I wasn't...

4151
03:32:42,960 --> 03:32:44,760
I wasn't ready to shape this.

4152
03:32:46,980 --> 03:32:47,460
Please.

4153
03:32:47,720 --> 03:32:49,460
I'm so scared because I'm 1 HP.

4154
03:32:52,300 --> 03:32:52,780
Please.

4155
03:32:54,500 --> 03:32:55,520
Oh my god!

4156
03:32:55,740 --> 03:32:57,820
I'm having a heart attack right now.

4157
03:32:57,820 --> 03:33:00,480
My blood pressure is not doing okay.

4158
03:33:02,860 --> 03:33:04,420
I'm so scared.

4159
03:33:05,240 --> 03:33:06,460
Oh fuck!

4160
03:33:12,410 --> 03:33:13,830
Oh my god, please.

4161
03:33:16,590 --> 03:33:17,950
Jesus Christ.

4162
03:33:19,890 --> 03:33:21,190
Oh my god, my cover.

4163
03:33:24,550 --> 03:33:26,770
Oh my god, please, there's so many people.

4164
03:33:30,630 --> 03:33:31,670
Just stay there.

4165
03:33:38,120 --> 03:33:40,460
Oh my god, he keeps fucking...

4166
03:33:42,800 --> 03:33:43,800
Please, no!

4167
03:33:49,420 --> 03:33:50,880
Wait, we got 42%.

4168
03:33:50,880 --> 03:33:51,880
That's fine.

4169
03:33:53,700 --> 03:33:55,380
Oh my god, the walls are falling.

4170
03:33:55,520 --> 03:33:57,460
I don't know what to do when the walls start falling.

4171
03:33:58,300 --> 03:34:02,660
My entire plan was to rely on cover, but then my cover is not forever.

4172
03:34:03,740 --> 03:34:05,080
That's so fucked up.

4173
03:34:05,080 --> 03:34:07,100
That's so fucked up.

4174
03:34:07,840 --> 03:34:10,540
That moment when your walls are not forever.

4175
03:34:11,440 --> 03:34:12,960
Like, what do you do?

4176
03:34:15,300 --> 03:34:18,280
What do you do when your walls are not forever?

4177
03:34:21,000 --> 03:34:22,620
You know what, fuck this one guy.

4178
03:34:23,400 --> 03:34:25,320
It's alright, their support is gone!

4179
03:34:26,600 --> 03:34:27,740
Their support ran away!

4180
03:34:31,890 --> 03:34:33,990
Oh my god, he fucking shot my thing.

4181
03:34:36,070 --> 03:34:39,090
Bro, he's just flying everywhere.

4182
03:34:42,390 --> 03:34:46,330
Guys, what do I do when they keep hitting my chain?

4183
03:34:51,920 --> 03:34:53,100
Bro, he just flies.

4184
03:34:54,080 --> 03:34:54,720
Bro, fuck this.

4185
03:34:55,220 --> 03:34:59,140
He just keeps flying.

4186
03:35:02,880 --> 03:35:04,640
He just keeps flying.

4187
03:35:08,810 --> 03:35:10,270
He just keeps flying.

4188
03:35:10,450 --> 03:35:12,370
I don't know what to do when he does that.

4189
03:35:15,530 --> 03:35:17,250
Oh my god.

4190
03:35:19,210 --> 03:35:19,690
No!

4191
03:35:22,830 --> 03:35:24,310
I didn't mean to grapple!

4192
03:35:31,090 --> 03:35:32,890
Guys, this is a harder to play Moon Knight.

4193
03:35:32,970 --> 03:35:33,890
I think it's time.

4194
03:35:34,230 --> 03:35:36,370
I think it's time to pull the Punisher.

4195
03:35:37,310 --> 03:35:38,130
This is way...

4196
03:35:38,990 --> 03:35:41,030
My platforms keep falling.

4197
03:35:43,050 --> 03:35:44,490
It's time for the ultimate.

4198
03:35:44,750 --> 03:35:46,050
It's like when you swapped a Bastion.

4199
03:35:46,530 --> 03:35:48,850
During the last...

4200
03:35:50,970 --> 03:35:54,490
It's exactly like when you swapped a Bastion during the last second.

4201
03:36:04,800 --> 03:36:07,040
When you were there, I could hear you.

4202
03:36:08,640 --> 03:36:09,680
I could hear you.

4203
03:36:11,920 --> 03:36:14,200
It's exactly when you swapped a Bastion.

4204
03:36:17,480 --> 03:36:18,500
Oh shit!

4205
03:36:27,130 --> 03:36:27,950
Oh no.

4206
03:36:29,410 --> 03:36:30,670
I'm trying my best.

4207
03:36:30,950 --> 03:36:32,410
I'm trying my best, guys.

4208
03:36:33,810 --> 03:36:35,230
I'm so close to ult.

4209
03:36:38,630 --> 03:36:38,910
Is it?

4210
03:36:43,970 --> 03:36:45,070
We got the support.

4211
03:36:45,210 --> 03:36:45,750
That's fine.

4212
03:36:47,510 --> 03:36:48,010
It's me!

4213
03:36:48,670 --> 03:36:50,250
He needed some death!

4214
03:36:52,310 --> 03:36:54,250
Oh my god!

4215
03:36:54,830 --> 03:36:56,990
You just needed to dance!

4216
03:37:01,220 --> 03:37:03,780
You just needed to keep dancing!

4217
03:37:07,170 --> 03:37:09,500
He like ran away from me.

4218
03:37:09,500 --> 03:37:10,860
I'm so confused.

4219
03:37:12,700 --> 03:37:14,380
You know those moments when...

4220
03:37:14,380 --> 03:37:16,660
When your healer just runs away?

4221
03:37:16,960 --> 03:37:18,340
Like, what do you do?

4222
03:37:25,200 --> 03:37:26,420
Guys, I think it's GG.

4223
03:37:26,800 --> 03:37:27,660
Guys.

4224
03:37:31,200 --> 03:37:31,800
No.

4225
03:37:34,320 --> 03:37:35,180
No way.

4226
03:37:35,880 --> 03:37:36,780
No way.

4227
03:37:41,970 --> 03:37:43,350
No way.

4228
03:37:43,850 --> 03:37:44,290
Yes!

4229
03:37:44,350 --> 03:37:45,210
We did it!

4230
03:37:46,330 --> 03:37:49,840
Oh my god!

4231
03:37:50,360 --> 03:37:51,920
Oh my god!

4232
03:37:57,920 --> 03:37:58,480
Dude,

4233
03:38:05,220 --> 03:38:06,360
you're too old.

4234
03:38:07,900 --> 03:38:08,460
Yeah.

4235
03:38:08,740 --> 03:38:10,020
Wait, how did you know?

4236
03:38:10,220 --> 03:38:11,320
How did you know?

4237
03:38:11,520 --> 03:38:13,400
It's my birthday today.

4238
03:38:21,320 --> 03:38:21,880
Yes!

4239
03:38:21,960 --> 03:38:22,960
Like, what do you mean?

4240
03:38:25,940 --> 03:38:27,760
Yes, of course!

4241
03:38:28,300 --> 03:38:28,720
Yes!

4242
03:38:28,820 --> 03:38:29,760
Oh my god!

4243
03:38:30,000 --> 03:38:34,340
Bro, I never had to work so hard for this.

4244
03:38:35,760 --> 03:38:42,460
I never had to work so fucking hard for this stupid game.

4245
03:38:42,960 --> 03:38:44,180
Oh my god.

4246
03:38:52,950 --> 03:38:54,530
Oh my god.

4247
03:38:55,110 --> 03:38:59,770
This match, I actually tried so fucking hard.

4248
03:39:01,050 --> 03:39:02,730
Because of this fucker.

4249
03:39:02,790 --> 03:39:04,090
Dude, fuck this guy.

4250
03:39:04,490 --> 03:39:07,010
This guy was the bait of my existence.

4251
03:39:07,210 --> 03:39:09,110
I had to win that game.

4252
03:39:13,830 --> 03:39:15,830
Oh my god.

4253
03:39:16,310 --> 03:39:16,910
Jesus.

4254
03:39:17,470 --> 03:39:18,430
I hate my team.

4255
03:39:19,030 --> 03:39:20,970
I hate my...

4256
03:39:20,970 --> 03:39:22,410
I actually...

4257
03:39:22,410 --> 03:39:25,170
I hate my team.

4258
03:39:25,510 --> 03:39:26,870
And I hate my enemy team.

4259
03:39:27,610 --> 03:39:28,950
Oh my god.

4260
03:39:29,390 --> 03:39:34,050
I still can't believe they like, ran...

4261
03:39:34,530 --> 03:39:41,330
I had the fucking Star Lord chase me around for like 50 fucking years.

4262
03:39:41,710 --> 03:39:46,290
And then he ran through my team to kill me.

4263
03:39:46,730 --> 03:39:49,950
Like, the healer didn't even look at me.

4264
03:39:52,970 --> 03:39:54,930
Oh my god.

4265
03:39:54,930 --> 03:39:56,950
That was so bullshit.

4266
03:39:57,510 --> 03:40:00,970
That was actually the game that like, broke me.

4267
03:40:01,130 --> 03:40:03,490
That was the moment where I was like, that's it.

4268
03:40:03,870 --> 03:40:04,870
That's fucking it.

4269
03:40:04,890 --> 03:40:06,430
I'm gonna put them in their place.

4270
03:40:06,970 --> 03:40:09,070
They don't deserve this win.

4271
03:40:12,170 --> 03:40:14,790
None of them do, but I won the win.

4272
03:40:16,250 --> 03:40:19,170
I'm here to make everybody else miserable.

4273
03:40:23,610 --> 03:40:24,390
Oh my god.

4274
03:40:24,430 --> 03:40:25,890
That was my canon event.

4275
03:40:26,310 --> 03:40:27,390
Alright, I'm gonna call it here.

4276
03:40:27,570 --> 03:40:29,270
But, before I end it.

4277
03:40:30,730 --> 03:40:31,970
I do have a special announcement.

4278
03:40:33,330 --> 03:40:34,670
I do have a very special announcement.

4279
03:40:35,210 --> 03:40:36,170
Oh, not these though.

4280
03:40:36,250 --> 03:40:37,650
Sorry, this was me shilling stuff.

4281
03:40:40,810 --> 03:40:42,430
Alright, so.

4282
03:40:42,770 --> 03:40:43,630
So, yes.

4283
03:40:43,870 --> 03:40:44,890
Special announcement time.

4284
03:40:45,010 --> 03:40:45,750
Special announcement time.

4285
03:40:45,910 --> 03:40:46,610
That was fun though.

4286
03:40:46,650 --> 03:40:47,710
I had a lot of fun in Marble Rivals.

4287
03:40:47,710 --> 03:40:49,130
I thought I could get to level 10.

4288
03:40:49,390 --> 03:40:51,990
Before the end of the stream.

4289
03:40:52,250 --> 03:40:54,330
But I definitely did not get to level 10.

4290
03:40:54,690 --> 03:40:56,390
Cause I really wanted to try out rank.

4291
03:40:56,530 --> 03:40:57,210
But, oh my god.

4292
03:40:57,250 --> 03:40:58,090
It was so too difficult.

4293
03:40:58,710 --> 03:41:00,690
It took so long.

4294
03:41:04,030 --> 03:41:06,090
It took so fucking long.

4295
03:41:06,530 --> 03:41:08,290
To even like, grind.

4296
03:41:08,690 --> 03:41:10,250
To like, level 7.

4297
03:41:10,270 --> 03:41:11,350
I think I got to level 7.

4298
03:41:11,750 --> 03:41:12,870
And that was the furthest I got.

4299
03:41:13,210 --> 03:41:15,010
But it was definitely really fun.

4300
03:41:15,010 --> 03:41:15,970
It...

4301
03:41:17,770 --> 03:41:22,550
It opened a very toxic side of me.

4302
03:41:27,210 --> 03:41:29,450
It definitely...

4303
03:41:30,850 --> 03:41:35,050
Gave me an incredibly toxic side of me.

4304
03:41:35,230 --> 03:41:35,890
While I was playing.

4305
03:41:39,610 --> 03:41:42,030
So, yeah.

4306
03:41:42,030 --> 03:41:43,270
For sure.

4307
03:41:43,990 --> 03:41:46,530
I definitely think my favorite characters.

4308
03:41:46,890 --> 03:41:47,730
Was Jeff.

4309
03:41:48,210 --> 03:41:48,930
It was Jeff.

4310
03:41:49,550 --> 03:41:52,170
It was Jeff and then.

4311
03:41:52,330 --> 03:41:53,690
For healing.

4312
03:41:54,270 --> 03:41:55,510
And DPS wise.

4313
03:41:55,970 --> 03:41:57,070
Has to be.

4314
03:41:57,810 --> 03:41:59,570
Oh my god, that's difficult.

4315
03:42:00,370 --> 03:42:01,630
DPS wise.

4316
03:42:02,170 --> 03:42:02,970
It's really difficult.

4317
03:42:03,210 --> 03:42:04,890
Because a lot of them are really fun.

4318
03:42:05,450 --> 03:42:06,470
If I want to win.

4319
03:42:06,610 --> 03:42:08,550
I pick Punisher.

4320
03:42:08,550 --> 03:42:10,110
Because it's literally...

4321
03:42:10,110 --> 03:42:10,530
Oh, shape.

4322
03:42:10,790 --> 03:42:11,030
Moon.

4323
03:42:11,170 --> 03:42:12,190
Moon Knight is my favorite.

4324
03:42:12,450 --> 03:42:12,730
Definitely.

4325
03:42:13,190 --> 03:42:13,650
Moon Knight.

4326
03:42:13,910 --> 03:42:15,890
Moon Knight is my favorite DPS.

4327
03:42:16,230 --> 03:42:18,730
Tank wise, I hope I never have to fucking play tank again.

4328
03:42:19,070 --> 03:42:21,110
I think tank is...

4329
03:42:21,110 --> 03:42:21,790
I'm sorry.

4330
03:42:21,910 --> 03:42:23,010
Just like every other game.

4331
03:42:24,870 --> 03:42:26,490
Tank is not fun at all.

4332
03:42:28,830 --> 03:42:30,290
Tank was so not fun.

4333
03:42:30,370 --> 03:42:31,390
I was fucking struggling.

4334
03:42:31,530 --> 03:42:33,850
I was like, no, not again.

4335
03:42:34,550 --> 03:42:37,230
Let me out of my prison cell.

4336
03:42:37,230 --> 03:42:38,770
Let me out.

4337
03:42:41,770 --> 03:42:42,210
Alright.

4338
03:42:42,890 --> 03:42:43,230
So.

4339
03:42:44,710 --> 03:42:45,590
The announcement.

4340
03:42:46,850 --> 03:42:48,390
Also, Zacona, thank you for the super chat.

4341
03:42:48,470 --> 03:42:49,330
Thank you, thank you.

4342
03:42:49,710 --> 03:42:51,770
First timer here pulled an all nighter to tune in.

4343
03:42:51,870 --> 03:42:53,250
Figured that today I'm turning a year older.

4344
03:42:53,370 --> 03:42:54,930
I want to let the best VTuber know.

4345
03:42:55,250 --> 03:42:57,150
My last bit of money before eating ice.

4346
03:42:57,290 --> 03:43:00,570
Thank you so much for your very first super chat.

4347
03:43:00,870 --> 03:43:02,790
I hope you enjoyed Marble Rivals.

4348
03:43:03,650 --> 03:43:05,010
And that you had fun.

4349
03:43:05,010 --> 03:43:07,050
Watching Marble Rivals.

4350
03:43:07,150 --> 03:43:07,950
It is free to play.

4351
03:43:08,430 --> 03:43:10,830
I know I didn't play any of the melee characters.

4352
03:43:11,290 --> 03:43:13,630
I personally don't really enjoy melee that much.

4353
03:43:13,950 --> 03:43:15,730
I like pointing at things and shooting.

4354
03:43:16,290 --> 03:43:17,030
That's what I like.

4355
03:43:17,470 --> 03:43:19,470
I'm not a melee fan.

4356
03:43:19,850 --> 03:43:21,090
I just like pointing at stuff.

4357
03:43:21,310 --> 03:43:22,790
And then go pew, pew, pew.

4358
03:43:23,450 --> 03:43:25,010
That's really it.

4359
03:43:28,850 --> 03:43:30,250
But yeah, happy birthday.

4360
03:43:30,970 --> 03:43:32,810
Happy birthday to you.

4361
03:43:32,810 --> 03:43:34,710
Happy birthday to you.

4362
03:43:34,830 --> 03:43:36,570
Happy birthday dear Sagona.

4363
03:43:36,970 --> 03:43:38,470
Happy birthday to you.

4364
03:43:38,470 --> 03:43:40,170
Yeah, happy birthday.

4365
03:43:40,650 --> 03:43:41,410
Happy birthday.

4366
03:43:42,610 --> 03:43:43,230
Yeah.

4367
03:43:43,650 --> 03:43:45,290
Well, I played Wolverine.

4368
03:43:45,570 --> 03:43:46,690
I thought it was really funny.

4369
03:43:47,130 --> 03:43:51,650
But I feel like I was only able to pull this off.

4370
03:43:51,870 --> 03:43:53,190
Because I actually had a team.

4371
03:43:53,370 --> 03:43:54,610
That knew what they were doing.

4372
03:43:54,970 --> 03:43:56,970
So all I did was just run in.

4373
03:43:57,090 --> 03:43:58,130
And go...

4374
03:43:58,760 --> 03:43:59,410
I'm angry.

4375
03:43:59,410 --> 03:44:01,410
And then fucking die.

4376
03:44:01,950 --> 03:44:03,970
So that's really it.

4377
03:44:05,710 --> 03:44:06,910
But like...

4378
03:44:06,910 --> 03:44:09,430
I tried overplaying melee characters before.

4379
03:44:09,690 --> 03:44:11,770
But I just got like super...

4380
03:44:11,770 --> 03:44:12,490
What's the word?

4381
03:44:12,770 --> 03:44:14,690
I get so like...

4382
03:44:15,270 --> 03:44:16,010
Not dizzy.

4383
03:44:16,370 --> 03:44:17,450
But like...

4384
03:44:17,450 --> 03:44:20,110
I don't know where I am.

4385
03:44:20,390 --> 03:44:21,470
What's that word?

4386
03:44:22,050 --> 03:44:25,850
Because the melee characters, you have to be able to move around so much.

4387
03:44:26,110 --> 03:44:27,150
Movement wise.

4388
03:44:27,150 --> 03:44:28,110
Disoriented.

4389
03:44:28,330 --> 03:44:31,590
Yeah, I get so disoriented when I play melee characters.

4390
03:44:31,710 --> 03:44:32,270
So I never...

4391
03:44:32,270 --> 03:44:34,590
I remember trying it during beta.

4392
03:44:34,850 --> 03:44:36,730
I tried it during beta.

4393
03:44:36,910 --> 03:44:38,190
And I was so fucking disoriented.

4394
03:44:38,390 --> 03:44:39,350
Because I don't know where to go.

4395
03:44:39,770 --> 03:44:40,470
And so I just...

4396
03:44:40,470 --> 03:44:44,250
I gave up on melee characters.

4397
03:44:44,550 --> 03:44:45,770
Because it's not for me.

4398
03:44:46,090 --> 03:44:47,690
I can't do that.

4399
03:44:50,330 --> 03:44:51,210
Hey guys.

4400
03:44:51,510 --> 03:44:52,570
Alright, special announcement.

4401
03:44:55,290 --> 03:44:55,930
So...

4402
03:44:55,930 --> 03:44:56,970
Wow!

4403
03:44:57,390 --> 03:44:58,470
Okay, so...

4404
03:44:58,470 --> 03:45:00,170
I'm gonna show you guys...

4405
03:45:00,170 --> 03:45:02,950
Something really pretty cool.

4406
03:45:04,390 --> 03:45:05,030
So...

4407
03:45:05,030 --> 03:45:06,490
My very, very, very, very...

4408
03:45:06,490 --> 03:45:07,330
Special announcement.

4409
03:45:10,170 --> 03:45:10,810
Is...

4410
03:45:10,810 --> 03:45:11,890
Oh wait, let me give me a sec.

4411
03:45:12,130 --> 03:45:13,430
I'm stalling even more.

4412
03:45:13,910 --> 03:45:15,290
With anticipation.

4413
03:45:15,290 --> 03:45:15,610
With anticipation.

4414
03:45:19,630 --> 03:45:22,050
What could it be?

4415
03:45:22,790 --> 03:45:23,290
Wow!

4416
03:45:24,510 --> 03:45:26,850
Alright, so...

4417
03:45:26,850 --> 03:45:29,730
I will send something very special...

4418
03:45:30,250 --> 03:45:31,270
To show you guys.

4419
03:45:32,850 --> 03:45:33,310
And...

4420
03:45:33,310 --> 03:45:35,930
This very special thing is...

4421
03:45:35,930 --> 03:45:36,890
Drumroll please.

4422
03:45:36,890 --> 03:45:38,890
Drumroll please.

4423
03:45:42,690 --> 03:45:42,710
Drumroll please.

4424
03:45:42,710 --> 03:45:42,850
Yes!

4425
03:45:44,150 --> 03:45:46,550
It's the Nendoroid!

4426
03:45:48,150 --> 03:45:48,850
Yes!

4427
03:45:49,230 --> 03:45:50,550
There it is!

4428
03:45:50,670 --> 03:45:51,970
The Nendoroid!

4429
03:45:52,110 --> 03:45:55,070
The unpainted version.

4430
03:45:56,450 --> 03:45:57,000
Oh wait...

4431
03:45:57,530 --> 03:45:58,270
That's not all.

4432
03:45:59,250 --> 03:46:00,550
Juki, what do you mean that's not all?

4433
03:46:01,530 --> 03:46:02,230
Because...

4434
03:46:02,230 --> 03:46:04,610
The unpainted version...

4435
03:46:04,610 --> 03:46:06,230
...was just the bait!

4436
03:46:06,430 --> 03:46:08,150
It's fully painted!

4437
03:46:15,380 --> 03:46:16,880
That's right!

4438
03:46:18,040 --> 03:46:23,620
Because pre-orders are coming very, very soon!

4439
03:46:24,280 --> 03:46:27,140
What do you mean by very soon, Doki?

4440
03:46:27,800 --> 03:46:31,980
As in, pre-orders will be this month in December.

4441
03:46:32,540 --> 03:46:34,600
So keep your eyes peeled...

4442
03:46:35,660 --> 03:46:38,120
...on when it'll be officially.

4443
03:46:41,000 --> 03:46:42,360
I requested...

4444
03:46:42,820 --> 03:46:45,920
The great thing about the proc... Like...

4445
03:46:45,920 --> 03:46:49,480
I actually got a request exactly what I wanted for my Nendoroid.

4446
03:46:49,760 --> 03:46:55,420
So, like, I get to request, like, what accessories I wanted...

4447
03:46:55,420 --> 03:46:58,300
...and, like, what type of expressions I wanted.

4448
03:46:58,600 --> 03:47:00,880
So, like, for accessories, I was like...

4449
03:47:00,880 --> 03:47:04,580
I need a croaky and a tomato in there.

4450
03:47:04,720 --> 03:47:07,800
I need croaky, tomato, and a dragoon.

4451
03:47:07,960 --> 03:47:10,780
And they were able to do all three for me.

4452
03:47:10,980 --> 03:47:13,420
But that means I don't have, like, a lot of hand accessories.

4453
03:47:13,600 --> 03:47:16,900
I think I only have, like, one hand accessory or something.

4454
03:47:18,220 --> 03:47:19,180
So... So...

4455
03:47:19,180 --> 03:47:20,360
But I thought it was worth it.

4456
03:47:20,520 --> 03:47:23,420
I honestly thought it was so fucking worth it.

4457
03:47:23,540 --> 03:47:26,880
Because, like, you know, like, it's just so me...

4458
03:47:26,880 --> 03:47:30,440
...to have, like, the tomato and croaky in there with me.

4459
03:47:30,440 --> 03:47:33,540
So, like, it was, like, the one thing I really wanted.

4460
03:47:33,920 --> 03:47:34,440
So...

4461
03:47:36,980 --> 03:47:40,700
Yeah, I thought it was much better than hand accessories.

4462
03:47:40,700 --> 03:47:45,540
So you can actually have, like, little croaky and the little tomato me over there.

4463
03:47:49,060 --> 03:47:50,020
So, yes!

4464
03:47:50,720 --> 03:47:51,140
Yes!

4465
03:47:51,340 --> 03:47:52,340
So here's the...

4466
03:47:53,240 --> 03:47:56,540
Here's the unpainted version, and here's the painted version.

4467
03:47:57,060 --> 03:47:58,520
I'm so... Oh my god.

4468
03:47:58,520 --> 03:48:01,140
It have everything... They work so fast, honestly.

4469
03:48:01,420 --> 03:48:03,840
And I'm really happy with how it turned out.

4470
03:48:04,180 --> 03:48:06,120
It actually looks so fucking good.

4471
03:48:06,520 --> 03:48:09,140
Like, the colors look amazing.

4472
03:48:09,800 --> 03:48:11,820
And, like, the details and everything.

4473
03:48:12,500 --> 03:48:14,900
And I'll be tweeting this out later as well.

4474
03:48:15,260 --> 03:48:15,920
So, yeah!

4475
03:48:16,360 --> 03:48:17,800
That's my special announcement!

4476
03:48:18,060 --> 03:48:20,460
It's gonna... Pre-orders will be very, very soon!

4477
03:48:20,680 --> 03:48:21,700
It's gonna be in December.

4478
03:48:22,180 --> 03:48:26,340
So keep your eyes peeled for December on when it's actually officially out.

4479
03:48:26,360 --> 03:48:27,320
I can't say when yet.

4480
03:48:27,320 --> 03:48:33,040
I can't say when, but it's definitely very soon this month!

4481
03:48:33,240 --> 03:48:34,100
So, yeah!

4482
03:48:34,500 --> 03:48:36,180
I'm super excited, guys.

4483
03:48:36,660 --> 03:48:38,640
I'm, like, running on fumes right now.

4484
03:48:38,820 --> 03:48:41,840
That... That Marble Rivals stream...

4485
03:48:42,520 --> 03:48:43,600
Fucked me up.

4486
03:48:46,120 --> 03:48:50,240
But, I hope you guys are super excited.

4487
03:48:50,940 --> 03:48:57,940
Also, by the way, today is the last day to vote for me for VTuber Awards.

4488
03:48:58,260 --> 03:49:00,440
So, I am up for several categories.

4489
03:49:00,640 --> 03:49:05,440
I'm up for Best VTuber, VTuber of the Year, FPS VTuber of the Year...

4490
03:49:06,560 --> 03:49:08,400
But, Best Event, which will be WrestleTuber.

4491
03:49:08,800 --> 03:49:11,360
And Best Fandom, which is you guys, Dragoons!

4492
03:49:11,520 --> 03:49:11,860
So, yeah!

4493
03:49:11,960 --> 03:49:12,600
Please vote!

4494
03:49:12,700 --> 03:49:13,740
Today's the last day!

4495
03:49:13,920 --> 03:49:15,860
I really want to win at least one thing.

4496
03:49:15,860 --> 03:49:18,800
And I hope... If anything, I hope it's, like, you know...

4497
03:49:18,800 --> 03:49:21,860
If we win only one thing, I hope it's Best Fandom.

4498
03:49:23,680 --> 03:49:26,740
Because you guys did so much for me.

4499
03:49:26,940 --> 03:49:28,780
Like, I couldn't have gotten Nendoroid without you guys.

4500
03:49:29,000 --> 03:49:35,220
Also, by the way, if you guys want Courage Doki, Bounty Hunter Doki Nendoroid...

4501
03:49:36,100 --> 03:49:39,340
We have enough cells to qualify for that.

4502
03:49:39,460 --> 03:49:40,660
Hint, hint, nudge, nudge.

4503
03:49:43,160 --> 03:49:59,380
So, obviously, if you see a lot of appeal, a lot of, like, people buying Retro Doki, we might be able to get Bounty Hunter Doki if we have enough cells for it.

4504
03:49:59,460 --> 03:50:00,080
So, yeah!

4505
03:50:00,300 --> 03:50:01,640
That's basically it, guys!

4506
03:50:02,200 --> 03:50:03,960
Thank you all for coming, everybody!

4507
03:50:04,140 --> 03:50:05,700
I had a great time playing Marble Rivals.

4508
03:50:06,100 --> 03:50:09,520
Honestly, like, my thoughts on Marble Rivals so far is that...

4509
03:50:10,660 --> 03:50:12,280
I don't find it competitive.

4510
03:50:12,600 --> 03:50:15,280
I just find it as, like, me being toxic.

4511
03:50:15,540 --> 03:50:17,360
Like, that's really it.

4512
03:50:17,680 --> 03:50:20,980
I don't... I don't... I don't think it's, like...

4513
03:50:20,980 --> 03:50:24,240
I personally don't think it's, like, super competitive so far.

4514
03:50:24,440 --> 03:50:25,640
I think it's fun.

4515
03:50:25,760 --> 03:50:27,560
It's, like, a head-empty type deal.

4516
03:50:28,000 --> 03:50:28,540
Fun type.

4517
03:50:28,800 --> 03:50:31,020
But also, I think it's also because I'm not playing ranked, though.

4518
03:50:31,140 --> 03:50:32,660
But it's definitely really fun.

4519
03:50:33,160 --> 03:50:34,600
Um, there's a lot of, like...

4520
03:50:34,600 --> 03:50:37,840
There's definitely a lot of a learning curve on some of the characters.

4521
03:50:37,940 --> 03:50:38,840
Like, I can't do melee.

4522
03:50:39,200 --> 03:50:40,280
I legitimately can't.

4523
03:50:40,280 --> 03:50:42,420
Like, I see the melee buttons.

4524
03:50:42,580 --> 03:50:44,740
Like, all the buttons for melee characters.

4525
03:50:44,840 --> 03:50:46,300
And I'm like, what the fuck am I doing?

4526
03:50:47,300 --> 03:50:47,700
Like...

4527
03:50:49,160 --> 03:50:52,940
I was like, I don't know what the fuck I'm supposed to do here.

4528
03:50:56,260 --> 03:50:57,060
So... So...

4529
03:50:57,060 --> 03:50:58,040
Um, but we'll see.

4530
03:50:58,180 --> 03:50:58,620
We'll see.

4531
03:50:58,740 --> 03:51:02,500
I still... Honestly, I think if it was the first person, I'd definitely enjoy it a lot more.

4532
03:51:04,420 --> 03:51:05,220
Um, uh...

4533
03:51:05,220 --> 03:51:06,520
But yeah, thank you everybody for coming.

4534
03:51:06,760 --> 03:51:08,360
As always, everyone, stay hydrated.

4535
03:51:08,540 --> 03:51:08,980
Posture check.

4536
03:51:08,980 --> 03:51:10,760
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

4537
03:51:10,880 --> 03:51:12,760
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

4538
03:51:12,960 --> 03:51:14,320
Cause you deserve it.

4539
03:51:14,440 --> 03:51:16,080
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

4540
03:51:16,520 --> 03:51:17,260
Bye, guys.

4541
03:51:17,580 --> 03:51:18,020
Bye!

4542
03:51:18,800 --> 03:51:19,940
I'm gonna zoom in.

4543
03:51:20,100 --> 03:51:21,940
Oh my god, look at her.

4544
03:51:22,340 --> 03:51:23,640
