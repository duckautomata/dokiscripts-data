00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,220
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,840
Alright, so we have a little problem.

3
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,520
I don't know how to fix this.

4
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:04,320
I've been trying to fix it for 10 minutes, but I can hear myself in the game!

5
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:12,060
Yes, good morning, because I literally woke up 30 minutes ago from a stress nap.

6
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,960
Because, you know, whenever you feel like, oh my god, there's so much stuff to do.

7
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,340
And then you're like, what if I nap away my problems?

8
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,200
Yes, do you hear the voices right now?

9
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:34,040
Do you hear... do you hear... do you hear two of me right now?

10
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,300
I don't know.

11
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,540
I don't know if you hear it right now, but like, if you don't hear it now, don't worry.

12
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,660
You'll hear it now.

13
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,820
I don't...

14
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,130
Okay, alright.

15
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,630
I... I don't know!

16
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:05,870
I don't know!

17
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,370
I've been trying to fix it for 20 minutes!

18
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,410
I can't... I can't fix it!

19
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:21,870
Like, I nap myself, but I don't want to hear more than two of me, because it's so hard to talk.

20
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:30,250
I don't know if you guys know this, but, like, when you hear a feedback of your own voice...

21
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,730
Um, and it's like a little bit delay.

22
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:37,890
It's actually really hard to talk because it, like, fucks you up.

23
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,170
Like, if there's like a small... no, it's because I tabbed out!

24
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:49,210
It's only fixed when I'm not tabbed into the game So like if I do this, I can hear myself now.

25
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:57,570
I have to talk slower because hearing myself fucks with my brain.

26
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,870
So I have to talk slower.

27
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,900
Fix it!

28
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,200
Okay, I'm gonna turn off the output right now.

29
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,100
So I don't... oh my... okay.

30
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,340
Okay, I'm gonna... actually, I don't know.

31
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:17,760
I don't know.

32
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,200
I'm gonna turn off the output right now.

33
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,200
Alright, so you don't hear me.

34
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,040
But I hear me.

35
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,000
Okay, I'm gonna mute myself too.

36
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,520
Okay, so like, the thing is...

37
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,600
I don't know what to... I checked my settings.

38
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,180
Yeah?

39
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,160
So like, I was looking through it.

40
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,000
It's not this.

41
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,460
It's not... I even like...

42
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,540
I even like...

43
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,220
Made sure to like, you know... I don't wanna hear master... hear master volume.

44
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,440
I turned that off.

45
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,580
It didn't work.

46
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,220
And then like, I turned all of these off.

47
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,040
It didn't work either.

48
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,260
I'm so conf... oh my god.

49
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,860
Okay, I'm like flashing in and out right now.

50
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,600
I'm gonna put borderless.

51
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,660
Like it's... I shouldn't, but like I'm like flashing.

52
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,720
I'm like, I see myself too.

53
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,760
Not only do I hear myself, but I also see myself.

54
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,140
I should...

55
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:19,080
You guys don't hear anything right now.

56
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,440
But I do.

57
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,320
It's not an OBS thing.

58
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,480
It's act... it's like... it's like... it's related to the game.

59
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:34,860
But like, I... I don't know... what can... what can fix it?

60
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,460
I don't know.

61
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,600
I'm so confused.

62
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,080
Like...

63
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,260
It's not audio voice chat!

64
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:44,920
Okay, I'm gonna...

65
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,460
Alright.

66
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,500
It's not... Oh, wait.

67
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,820
Okay, nevermind.

68
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,260
I hear myself.

69
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:49,600
Wait.

70
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:50,420
Wait, no.

71
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,020
I hear myself.

72
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,920
Yeah, I forgot.

73
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,540
I muted the thing.

74
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,700
Okay, I'm gonna turn all of this off.

75
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,660
Okay.

76
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,780
Yeah.

77
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,940
It doesn't work.

78
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,580
But what if...

79
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,280
What if... No.

80
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:10,400
No.

81
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,400
Okay.

82
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,740
Does anyone remember what it was?

83
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,920
Does anyone... Does anyone remember...

84
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,220
Was this three...

85
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,900
I don't remember...

86
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,040
Okay, I'm gonna turn off...

87
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,820
I turn off the...

88
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,820
My mic on OBS.

89
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,720
Wait.

90
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,640
That helps you guys, but it doesn't help me!

91
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,500
Because I have to hear myself!

92
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,600
Okay, nevermind.

93
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,660
Okay, nevermind.

94
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,120
Because like... Because like... I...

95
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,860
I have to listen to myself!

96
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:16,780
Like...

97
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,300
Okay.

98
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,400
Alright.

99
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,960
What else can we do, guys?

100
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,620
What else?

101
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:31,640
Guys!

102
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,980
What was these?

103
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,660
I don't remember!

104
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,240
Oh, I'm just gonna...

105
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,780
Reset settings...

106
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,620
Does it reset all my other stuff?

107
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,440
Nooooooo...

108
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,580
It's... Steam mic settings...

109
00:07:53,580 --> 00:08:02,280
Steam setting... Voice... Push to talk...

110
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,880
Where's Steam mic?

111
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,020
Where the fuck is that?

112
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,560
Sorry, I'm... I'm not stupid...

113
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,780
Because I'm talking slow...

114
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,600
It's because... It's very difficult...

115
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,660
To talk...

116
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,600
Okay... Okay...

117
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:30,920
Uh... Shift... Tab... Settings... Voice...

Push to talk!

120
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,780
Did it work?

121
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,220
Hello?

122
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,040
Nope.

123
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,580
Okay...

00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,680

Okay...

129
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,490
Did it work?

130
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:03,910
No...

131
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,210
No, it didn't...

132
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,550
Okay... Push to talk... Push to talk...

133
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,430

Okay... Okay...

00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,350
Okay.

136
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,550
Give me a sec.

137
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,250
Oh my god, please.

138
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,370
Okay, I'm gonna restart my game.

139
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,190
Alright guys.

140
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,490
Alright, I'm res- Sorry, that was so trippy.

141
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,110
That was so trippy.

142
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,670
Yes, welcome to Bodycam.

143
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,230
The game.

144
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,050
Woah!

145
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,490
Woah!

146
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,140
Holy shit.

147
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:53,910
Guys.

148
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,370
How?

149
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:58,890
How?

150
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,310
Why is it so loud?

151
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,570
Why is it so loud?

152
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,210
It's not stopping!

153
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,890
Oh my god.

154
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:07,910
Oh.

155
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,730
What the fuck?

156
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:10,590
Okay.

157
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,510
Okay, I don't hear myself anymore.

158
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:13,850
Okay.

159
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,710
Good news.

160
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,630
I'm so sorry.

161
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,050
I booted it up.

162
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,190
And then...

163
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,130
I booted it up and it played a YouTube video.

164
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,630
But like, I couldn't mute it.

165
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,910
Like, it was so fucked up.

166
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:29,790
But!

167
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,390
Good news is...

168
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,510
I don't hear myself anymore.

169
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,050
So...

170
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,070
That's good news.

171
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,630
Hey guys!

172
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,170
I don't hear myself anymore.

173
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,910
Okay, but you guys...

174
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,090
Okay.

175
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:46,710
Alright.

176
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:47,190
Okay.

177
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:47,810
We fixed it.

178
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:48,410
Alright.

179
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,010
Everything's good now.

180
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:50,730
Alright.

181
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,290
Anyway.

182
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,630
Oh wait, I'm not showing it.

183
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,430
Okay, give me a sec.

184
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,030
Alright.

185
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,010
Good news is...

186
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:58,010
Good news is... the double... I just had to...

187
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,710
Uh, like the old thing.

188
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,790
Have you ever tried turning it on and off again?

189
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,150
That was the key.

190
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,610
We just had to turn it on and off again.

191
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,870
We had to go a little bit deaf for...

192
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,650
I'm so sorry.

193
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:09,810
I don't know.

194
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,210
It was like this video.

195
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,930
And like, if I press play, it's gonna play like a really loud video.

196
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:15,930
And...

197
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:18,370
And...

198
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,730
This was the issue all along.

199
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,170
This...

200
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,470
This was it.

201
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,390
So, yay!

202
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,010
We fucking did it!

203
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,970
I'm gonna put it back to full screen.

204
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,510
I feel like full screen is the best for me.

205
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:32,750
Okay.

206
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,810
Oh, this reset itself too.

207
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,170
Okay, so I'm gonna...

208
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,390
I'll put that here.

209
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,270
And then...

210
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,150
And then I think...

211
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,250
I think that's good.

212
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,050
Alright.

213
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,970
Wait, why is it like that?

214
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:46,650
Why is it like this?

215
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,070
Guys, what is wrong with this game?

216
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,330
Okay, sorry.

217
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,250
Alright, it like...

218
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,630
I couldn't click on anything for a bit.

219
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,550
Okay, anyway.

220
00:11:58,770 --> 00:11:59,930
For those who don't know what this...

221
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,490
This game has like 2000 reviews, I feel like.

222
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:03,770
Um, wait.

223
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,610
No, it had more.

224
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:05,090
Okay.

225
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,590
So, for those who don't know what this game is...

226
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,710
This is... Oh my god, it's like flashing in and out.

227
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:09,930
Sorry.

228
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:10,750
I was like...

229
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:15,830
I was like...

230
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:17,950
My...

231
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:19,450
My...

232
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,150
My face is like flashing through the game.

233
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,070
Oh my god.

234
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:23,410
Alright.

235
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:24,710
Sorry.

236
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,010
So, for those who don't know what this game is...

237
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:31,290
This is basically like a very realistic shooter.

238
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,290
It's like apparently one of the most realistic shooters out there.

239
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,790
It's not Unrecord.

240
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,690
These guys capitalized on Unrecord.

241
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,050
Unrecord was the original...

242
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:41,750
Um...

243
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,230
It was the original body cam shooter game.

244
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:45,810
It was the original body cam shooter game.

245
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,470
That went viral.

246
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,930
This one is...

247
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,110
Two guys that saw...

248
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,290
Unrecord...

249
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,930
Go viral...

250
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,270
And then made the game first.

251
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,430
And released the game first.

252
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,330
So...

253
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,730
They saw...

254
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,310
They saw Unrecord...

255
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,310
And then they released this first.

256
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,990
Before Unrecord could release.

257
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,010
Um... But...

258
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,670
I heard that like...

259
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,470
People said like...

260
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,010
This game looks crazy.

261
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,670
But like... If you have a shitty PC...

262
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,870
You cannot run it.

263
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,350
Because you know...

264
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,650
The graphics for this is insane.

265
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,770
In terms of like...

266
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,830
Quote on quote...

267
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:32,770
Realism.

268
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,330
I don't know.

269
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,970
I try to make it so that...

270
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,850
I try to make it less realistic.

271
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,950
Because I heard the...

272
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,510
I heard the...

273
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,490
The homelessness for this...

274
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,010
Is like...

275
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,330
Pretty insane.

276
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:49,870
So like...

277
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,750
I am sorry if like...

278
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,990
It still...

279
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:53,650
Uh...

280
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,210
Oh yeah...

281
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,390
Apparently, it's a bit poorly optimized.

282
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,970
Apparently, the optimization for this...

283
00:13:58,970 --> 00:13:59,990
Is a little iffy.

284
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:01,470
Um...

285
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,250
Anyway.

286
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:03,350
Anyway...

287
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,230
Okay, not a little bit.

288
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,790
But it could be pretty bad, the optimization, because of the whole realism part.

289
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,150
What else do I have to say?

290
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:12,490
Yeah.

291
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,930
I tried to lessen the camera shake.

292
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,550
You can lessen the camera shake.

293
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,690
So we'll see how this goes.

294
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,890
We'll see...

295
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,110
We'll see what it's like to play this game.

296
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:23,890
Alright, start match.

297
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,670
Do I... I'll do a quick play.

298
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,150
Automatic buy and join the closest or fullest server.

299
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,090
Alright, you know what?

300
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,910
Does anyone else have this game?

301
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,890
Okay, I'll do a quick play first.

302
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:38,070
I feel like I'll get absolutely destroyed.

303
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,270
But we'll do a quick play first.

304
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,410
Alright, blood indicates... Okay, cam connected.

305
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:43,890
Whoa!

306
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:46,290
Whoa!

307
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,790
I knew I forgot to do something.

308
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:54,250
I did everything but my sensitivity.

309
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,810
Okay, let me fix that.

310
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:57,230
Alright.

311
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,430
Okay.

312
00:14:59,430 --> 00:14:59,990
Whoa.

313
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:01,510
Oh look.

314
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:01,890
Marked.

315
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,250
Marky boy, what are you doing over here, Marky boy?

316
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:05,290
Whoa.

317
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,150
What are you trying to do?

318
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,790
Alright, FBI open up right now.

319
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,970
Whoa, the drone's coming.

320
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,530
Wait, how do I fly?

321
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:15,870
How do I...

322
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,430
Whoa.

323
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:20,910
Whoa.

324
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,590
Yo, okay.

325
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:26,250
I can tell where the motion sickness is coming in now.

326
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,710
Oh shit.

327
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:29,710
What the fuck?

328
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:31,830
Oh!

329
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,310
Oh!

330
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,110
Oh!

331
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,350
Poor guy.

332
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,750
Okay.

333
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:36,810
Alright.

334
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,730
Where's my gun?

335
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,510
Alright.

336
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,670
That's my gun.

337
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:42,510
Okay.

338
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:43,110
Oh.

339
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,430
Oh my god.

340
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:44,850
Oh.

341
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,370
Oh.

342
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:47,710
Oh.

343
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:48,490
Oh.

344
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,190
Oh.

345
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:49,930
Oh.

346
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:50,030
Oh.

347
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:52,650
Oh.

348
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,590
Oh.

349
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,750
Oh my god.

350
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:02,850
Oh my god.

351
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:03,990
It's like I'm actually walking.

352
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,030
Oh.

353
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,150
Do I just...

354
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,990
Are we trying to disarm something?

355
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,250
Where are the...

356
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,590
Imagine this in VR.

357
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:16,030
I know.

358
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,790
This is actually crazy if this was in VR.

359
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,550
This is actually...

360
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,070
This feels so wonky.

361
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:22,950
Oh my god.

362
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,030
It feels so fucking wonky.

363
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:26,910
Not gonna lie.

364
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,090
Oh!

365
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,030
It's so loud!

366
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:29,690
Oh my god.

367
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,810
It's so loud.

368
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,070
The shooting is so...

369
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:32,570
Okay.

370
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:37,430
The volume was like guys don't you know guns are real and guns are very loud.

371
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:38,710
Oh no.

372
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,610
My teammates are dead.

373
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,150
How is that possible?

374
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,350
I'm sorry.

375
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,770
I didn't realize.

376
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,270
Where are they?

377
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:48,850
What?

378
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,590
I'm so...

379
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,550
I'm making this so bad.

380
00:16:58,330 --> 00:16:59,570
I'm sorry.

381
00:16:59,590 --> 00:16:59,690
I'm so sorry.

382
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,970
I don't know.

383
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,730
I was like whoa.

384
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,290
I was still...

385
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,770
Holy shit guys.

386
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,090
I can't believe it.

387
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,310
People die so fast.

388
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,650
Cause like it's real.

389
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,130
It's so real.

390
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,450
It's so real.

391
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,050
Wait.

392
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,290
Am I the only one here?

393
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,550
All my teammates left me.

394
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,070
I'm sorry.

395
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:28,230
Is it cause I'm open micing?

396
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,030
I can't tell.

397
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:29,690
I'm sorry.

398
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,210
My teammates left me.

399
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,550
Oh no.

400
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,650
I'm sorry.

401
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:43,050
I'm sorry for being bad.

402
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,930
I literally just got...

403
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,770
It's okay.

404
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,270
I don't...

405
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,570
I'm just playing.

406
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:54,950
I just started playing.

407
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,470
No.

408
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,690
How was I supposed to know?

409
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:00,150
I'm supposed to know!

410
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,380
What?

411
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,420
What?

412
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,360
Stop it!

413
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,640
Oh my god, I have teammates!

414
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,200
Oh thank god!

415
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,600
Cheesekeep and Richard Scale!

416
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,060
Okay.

417
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,440
Okay, alright.

418
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,540
Jesus Christ.

419
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,300
Probably should go- the word cannot go!

420
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,160
I feel like there's like one way!

421
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,980
Guys, did you guys know that like, how do I climb?

422
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,760
How do I climb in this realism?

423
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,980
Guys, I don't know if I can climb.

424
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:42,840
Okay.

425
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,660
Is there another route?

426
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,720
Okay, don't go there.

427
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,180
Okay, we'll go this way.

428
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,200
I wanna go to the forest!

429
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,200
The forest was- did you guys- the forest map was the most interesting one.

430
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,180
For me.

431
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,280
Alright.

432
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,900
When can I be defense?

433
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,680
I feel like defense is the cooler way to play.

434
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,060
Defense you can actually camp.

435
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,340
Okay.

436
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,480
Guys, do you see them?

437
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,080
I feel like they're gonna see me before I see them.

438
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,430
Where are they?

439
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,290
Oh, there's Chief Skeef.

440
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,850
There he is!

441
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,690
There's Chief Skeef!

442
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,550
There he is!

443
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,030
Where are they?

444
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:29,770
Ugh!

445
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,370
Did we do it?

446
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,390
We did it!

447
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,610
Hahahaha!

448
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,490
Hahahaha!

449
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,210
Hahahaha!

450
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,450
Hahahaha!

451
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:43,990
Weeeeee!

452
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,990
Hahahaha!

453
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,910
We did it!

454
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:54,170
I'm still learning!

455
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,090
But we did it!

456
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,890
Holy shooot!

457
00:19:58,930 --> 00:19:59,610
Hahahaha!

458
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,270
Guys, yes, I did it!

459
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,370
I did do something!

460
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:08,410
I found another staircase to go up!

461
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,050
What do you mean I did nothing?

462
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,610
I found a second staircase!

463
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,170
Where are they?

464
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,870
This is so scary.

465
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,930
Because it's so real.

466
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,510
So I don't know where they are.

467
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:23,790
Hello?

468
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,450
Hey guys.

469
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,770
Where are they?

470
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,990
Where are they?

471
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:32,390
Where are they?

472
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,310
Where the bum?

473
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,170
We did it!

474
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:37,610
Yeah!

475
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,830
I did nothing!

476
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:39,970
Hahahaha!

477
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:41,950
Hahahaha!

478
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,150
How's the volume so far?

479
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,250
How's the volume so far?

480
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:49,390
Hahahaha!

481
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:51,690
Yeeey!

482
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:52,610
Hahahaha!

483
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,250
That's fucking right!

484
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,630
I have a full team now!

485
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,470
I have Chief Ski!

486
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:04,770
Hahahaha!

487
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:05,010
That you?

488
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,250
That's right!

489
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:06,930
Goodbye!

490
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:09,690
Okay.

491
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,350
Wow, guns are loud.

492
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:12,390
Did you guys know that?

493
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,710
Guns are fucking loud.

494
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:15,710
Hahahaha!

495
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:16,970
Wow!

496
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:17,510
No!

497
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,370
What the fuck?

498
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,190
Who killed me?

499
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,050
Who the fuck killed me?

500
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:26,530
Hehehehehe!

501
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:28,290
Woah!

502
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,830
Round lost?

503
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,650
We have four people!

504
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,270
How could the round...

505
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,890
Wait, I didn't kill that man?

506
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,510
I'm sad.

507
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,010
I didn't kill him.

508
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:44,770
Okay, let's turn down the volume a little bit.

509
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:45,910
There you go.

510
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,110
Jesus Christ.

511
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,390
Bring me to the forest!

512
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,430
The forest is where all the cool kids are!

513
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,030
Guns, guns, guns!

514
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:55,590
Oh, bam!

515
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,570
What do you mean?

516
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,410
Aren't you excited?

517
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,130
It's a shooter!

518
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,390
Hahahaha!

519
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:04,090
You get to be an FBI?

520
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,950
Or a SWAT team?

521
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:06,610
I don't know.

522
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:07,870
I don't know.

523
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,790
It's just... it's like a tactical shooter.

524
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,410
But it's real.

525
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,390
It's for real.

526
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:16,770
Wait, he's dead.

527
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,630
Now he's extra dead.

528
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,590
I contributed.

529
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:24,770
Wait, it's... okay.

530
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:25,350
We did it.

531
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:26,510
Guys!

532
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:27,570
I can help!

533
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,110
AHHHHHHHHHH!

534
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,250
What if I just shoot him right now?

535
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:33,590
What if I...

536
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:35,810
Is he doing it?

537
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,290
Is he doing it?

538
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:38,990
Did he do it?

539
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,130
Did he do it?

540
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:41,930
Did he just chuck it?

541
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:45,470
Hahahaha!

542
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:48,170
Hahahaha!

543
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:50,610
We won!

544
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:52,110
It doesn't matter!

545
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:53,970
We won!

546
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:55,530
Did we?

547
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,490
Yeah, we did.

548
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:57,250
Okay.

549
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,010
I didn't get penalized for it too.

550
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,090
That's great.

551
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,890
Guys, bring me to the forest!

552
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:07,070
The forest seems like the most fun map!

553
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,090
Alright, after this game, we're gonna host our own map.

554
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,710
And do the forest.

555
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,950
That's all I wanted to do.

556
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,390
The forest.

557
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,430
I wanna do defense too.

558
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,510
It feels like defense has the most fun as well.

559
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:21,510
Okay, I'm gonna rush in.

560
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,470
They won't expect it because I can barely hear anything too.

561
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,460
Wait, where are they?

562
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,200
Wait, what?

563
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,260
Where are they?

564
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,000
Hello?

565
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,460
Wait, where's the bomb?

566
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,100
The bomb is like here.

567
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,240
Where did he place the bomb?

568
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,440
Hello?

569
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,660
It's clearly beeping somewhere.

570
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,280
I don't know where the bomb is either!

571
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,100
I'm stuck!

572
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,600
They placed it below us?

573
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,400
They placed it below us?

574
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:11,420
They placed it below us?

575
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,820
Holy shit!

576
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,660
The wild man!

577
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,440
The wild man!

578
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:19,620
He actually placed it below us!

579
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,760
It's off the volume now.

580
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,500
That's actually fucking crazy!

581
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,940
You can do that?

582
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,660
Wait, I'm gonna go back.

583
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,160
I see it.

584
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,180
I see it.

585
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,280
I see it.

586
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:42,940
Please!

587
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,340
No!

588
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,760
No!

589
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,320
Was I close?

590
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,780
Guys, was I close?

591
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:58,040
Do you think I was close?

592
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,120
Guys!

593
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,820
Guys, do you think I was close?

594
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,180
Do you think I almost did it?

595
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,920
Guys, I'm an apex player, not a Valorant player.

596
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,520
Please!

597
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,800
It's right here!

598
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,120
It's below us!

599
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,380
It's below us!

600
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,580
Oh, whoops!

601
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,720
Sorry, I'm not very good at driving drones as well.

602
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,980
Do we do it?

603
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,580
Oh, guys, I don't think we did it, guys.

604
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,940
I don't think we did it.

605
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,280
How are we losing?

606
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,560
It's a fucking 4v2!

607
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,680
We can't be that bad!

608
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,080
Oh, it's a 4v3 now.

609
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:43,560
Okay.

610
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,580
No, it's nighttime?

611
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,280
Oh, no.

612
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,520
That's worse.

613
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,860
How do I see at night?

614
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,760
Oh, we have a flashlight.

615
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,480
Oh, I'm defending.

616
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,060
Oh.

617
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,140
I was like, wait, what am I holding?

618
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,000
Whoops.

619
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,800
Guys, my camera's gonna drown now.

620
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,620
Guys, I didn't realize we were defending.

621
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,120
I think

622
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:28,740
the teammate was mad at me.

623
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,760
I'm pretty shit.

624
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,620
I'm pretty... Wait, you can shoot through that?

625
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,120
Holy shit.

626
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,400
How was I supposed to know we were defending?

627
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,900
I was too busy trying to figure out what I'm doing.

628
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,500
Okay.

629
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,320
Please.

630
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,240
No, I don't wanna hold on to... Why am I holding on to this?

631
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,060
I don't know.

632
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,450
We'll put it on the staircase.

633
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:16,830
I don't know how to put down... They just kill me because they don't know.

634
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:21,290
They know I don't know how...

635
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:29,460
They kill me because they know I don't... I was like...

636
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:29,930
How do

637
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:38,630
I...

638
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,950
The RIT was so mean to me.

639
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:48,370
I'm so fucked up, man.

640
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,010
I can't believe it.

641
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:56,130
They killed me because they don't know how to put down the bomb.

642
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:58,890
I didn't even want the bomb in the first place.

643
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,690
I didn't know I was gonna pick up the bomb.

644
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:11,130
There's my... I contributed, guys.

645
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:12,730
Guys.

646
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,090
Oh, the enemy killed me.

647
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:14,670
Oh, thank God.

648
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:15,110
Okay.

649
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,570
At least I know...

650
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,710
At least I know I contributed, guys.

651
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,570
We did it.

652
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,210
We won the round.

653
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,730
We did it.

654
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:26,210
Please.

655
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,150
Oh, thank God.

656
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,490
Oh, thank...

657
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:30,070
Yay!

658
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:33,650
Yay!

659
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:37,210
Wait.

660
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,050
How do I see through the night?

661
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,310
Wait a minute.

662
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,210
How do they see through the night?

663
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,730
Guys, what's the...

664
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,010
What's the...

665
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:47,370
button for...

666
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,230
night goggles?

667
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,470
Guys, I should have it.

668
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,370
I'm part of the team.

669
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,260
Well, I saw them.

670
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:15,220
I saw the man.

671
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,100
He shot me.

672
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,720
He shot me.

673
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,360
I saw him.

674
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:19,560
I saw the man.

675
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,680
I found him, guys.

676
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,120
I found him.

677
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:29,740
Why do they get to defend in the day and we have to defend on the night?

678
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,780
This is actually not fair.

679
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,080
Like, what the fuck?

680
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,420
They literally get to play at night time?

681
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,060
They literally get to play at night time?

682
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,320
Oh my God.

683
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,320
Guys, I'm just a fucking baby.

684
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,040
Guys, I'm just a fucking baby.

685
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,280
Guys, this has like...

686
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,380
How many reviews?

687
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,360
This game has like...

688
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,580
3,000 plus positive reviews?

689
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:54,900
Did we do it?

690
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,700
We did it, guys!

691
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:57,980
We did it!

692
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,340
Okay, I have a flashlight now.

693
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,620
We did it, guys.

694
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,000
We finally did it.

695
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,320
Oh my God.

696
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,700
We fucking did it, guys.

697
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,580
We figured it out.

698
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,020
Okay, I won't turn my lights off.

699
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,740
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

700
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,860
I'm gonna run away.

701
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,940
Goodbye, chief.

702
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,080
Goodbye, chief.

703
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:21,900
Whoa!

704
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,360
There's somebody inside!

705
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,270
Now it's daytime!

706
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,930
Guys, did I do it?

707
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:44,030
Did I?

708
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:45,570
No!

709
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,490
Guys, do you think I did it?

710
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:51,310
Guys...

711
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,410
It was better, right?

712
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:57,630
Do you think it's...

713
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,210
You know, it was better.

714
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,470
I think I did a lot better.

715
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:08,150
I think I did a lot better.

716
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,230
Hey, guys.

717
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:11,870
I'm improving.

718
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,330
Wait, there's more people now?

719
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,270
How do they have more players?

720
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,110
How is there more people playing this game?

721
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:18,570
Okay.

722
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:19,490
Okay.

723
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:26,530
I'm here with people playing this game.

724
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:28,130
Okay.

725
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,270
No, please!

726
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:30,530
Please!

727
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,160
People...

728
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,580
I would've thought people died so fast!

729
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,380
Oh my God.

730
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,280
Guys, I think I got a kill.

731
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,500
Guys.

732
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,020
I think I got a kill, guys.

733
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,560
I think...

734
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:50,940
I think I got a kill, guys.

735
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,320
I think I did it, right?

736
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,840
Guys, I totally got a kill there.

737
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,220
Right, guys?

738
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,320
Let's tone down the motion here real fast.

739
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,580
Where the fuck is it?

740
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,360
Okay.

741
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:08,280
Display, graphics, display...

742
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:08,880
Was it control?

743
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,260
Oh, there we go.

744
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,100
Camera sh...

745
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,520
Zero camera sh...

746
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,560
Okay.

747
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,200
That shit...

748
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,270
Oh my God.

749
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,650
Oh my God.

750
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:28,830
Did you hear that?

751
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,350
They're like doing like...

752
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,110
Intel.

753
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,270
Like, one more, one more.

754
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,110
Left side of blue.

755
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,050
Left side of blue.

756
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:36,430
Is that our guy?

757
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:37,770
Richard, you got this, Richard!

758
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:39,950
We got this!

759
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:43,090
We're the bad guys, but we got...

760
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:43,710
Dude, okay.

761
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:46,150
This is a very bad oil rig.

762
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:46,670
Okay?

763
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,510
This oil rig is owned by bad people.

764
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:51,830
So we're the good guys.

765
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:53,850
Did we win?

766
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,190
Did we do it?

767
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:58,610
Guys, did we do it?

768
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,410
Guys, did we win?

769
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,850
How am I minus one?

770
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,950
How is that possible?

771
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:11,570
How did I...

772
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,850
How do I lose a kill?

773
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:20,910
Oh, I killed my own teammate!

774
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:22,170
Oh!

775
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,470
That makes more sense now.

776
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:25,510
Actually.

777
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,810
Gosh, I walk so slow.

778
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,190
As if I'm trying to...

779
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:29,910
No!

780
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,620
I thought that he was part of the scenery!

781
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,880
I was like, whoa!

782
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,400
I thought that...

783
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:45,140
I thought he was part of the scenery!

784
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,020
I thought he was part of the scenery!

785
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,160
I was like, whoa!

786
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:48,680
What's that?

787
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,440
What's that?

788
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,400
He hit me!

789
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:55,900
Actually.

790
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,360
You're on my corner!

791
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,240
I checked my corner after...

792
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,940
What's that?

793
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,200
What the fuck?

794
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:08,940
That's cheating!

795
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,020
That's not realism!

796
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,020
That's not realism at all!

797
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,080
He's...

798
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,320
He's basic through the windows!

799
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,780
I am not being immersed right now.

800
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,880
I am...

801
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,880
Why am I so slow?

802
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,580
Do I have like... too much stuff on me?

803
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,340
Oh no, okay.

804
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:35,980
Okay.

805
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,980
It's a window.

806
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,120
No, he phased through!

807
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,760
Not realistic!

808
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,680
I'm un-immersed right now.

809
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,840
My immersion was ruined.

810
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,640
Did I do it?

811
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,940
Is he dead?

812
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,180
Did I do it, guys?

813
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,280
I think I did it.

814
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,220
I got a kill!

815
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:01,820
No!

816
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,280
It's okay.

817
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,380
I brought someone down with me, guys.

818
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,920
It's okay.

819
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:13,900
I think...

820
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,960
I think I got him.

821
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:15,760
Guys, look!

822
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,080
I got zero kills now!

823
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,480
I'm improving!

824
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,680
I have zero kills now!

825
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,240
Yay!

826
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,180
I got better!

827
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,080
Team, you guys gotta win this!

828
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:29,720
Team!

829
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,620
You guys gotta do this for me!

830
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,800
Can't go in there with my... Oh wait, no.

831
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,840
If they lose this, I have a chance to have one kill.

832
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,560
I got net zero.

833
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,560
Net zero KDA.

834
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,960
That's what I'm...

835
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,780
That's what I'm talking about.

836
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,260
Holy shit, what the fuck?

837
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,260
Did we do it?

838
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:51,820
No!

839
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,760
They did... Oh wait, no.

840
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,160
That's good.

841
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:53,460
That's good.

842
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,480
I have another chance to...

843
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,540
I have another chance to, like, uh...

844
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,680
get another kill.

845
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:00,500
Okay.

846
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:03,380
Alright.

847
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:04,660
This is good.

848
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,080
This is good.

849
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,400
I have another chance to get another kill now.

850
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,160
This is good.

851
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,520
Can you hear me?

852
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:23,890
Guys, I think they heard me.

853
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:24,910
I...

854
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:32,270
Guys, I think... I think they heard me, guys.

855
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:37,890
Guys, I think...

856
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:37,890
I think they heard me, guys.

857
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:38,710
Someone, please!

858
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:39,830
A raid!

859
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:40,310
Someone, please!

860
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:40,310
A raid!

861
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:42,150
A pinch-bop dead body!

862
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:44,110
Guys... guys...

863
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:45,370
Guys...

864
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:45,370
guys...

865
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,970
I broke my drone.

866
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,950
I broke...

867
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:52,390
Not only...

868
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:54,630
Not only did I...

869
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,050
Not only did I...

870
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:57,850
die... I also...

871
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,150
broke my drone.

872
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:00,350
...

873
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:01,070
...

874
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,730
Holy shit.

875
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,190
This game is so hard.

876
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:08,650
It's like...

877
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:09,890
It's like...

878
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:13,110
It's like it's so real.

879
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,910
It's almost like it's...

880
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:16,530
real life.

881
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:19,970
I can't believe when you get shot by a gun...

882
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:20,890
you just die.

883
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:22,950
Like, isn't that crazy?

884
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,190
...

885
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,190
Isn't that insane?

886
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:30,030
Like, I thought...

887
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,350
you know, you would live like...

888
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,650
for like 30 more seconds longer...

889
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:36,290
and then, you know, you just get a band-aid...

890
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:37,950
and then you put the band-aid on...

891
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:38,470
you'll be okay.

892
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,070
Hey, I got plus 100 R!

893
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,150
I'm a thousand...

894
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,210
100 R now!

895
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,410
Let's go!

896
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:47,270
Rank depends on kills, deaths, and wins.

897
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:50,310
You can reduce in rank or increase...

898
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:51,530
I...

899
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:52,550
ranked up!

900
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,670
I'm pretty good at this game.

901
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:56,910
Guys?

902
00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:59,670
Okay, no.

903
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,370
No.

904
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,630
Alright, let's actually make our...

905
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:03,970
Wait.

906
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,350
What the fuck?

907
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:07,870
Where am I?

908
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,370
Hello?

909
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:12,780
Wha...

910
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,570
Where am I?

911
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:17,470
How did I get here?

912
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:18,670
Yay!

913
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,990
I don't know how I...

914
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:22,530
I don't know how I...

915
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:22,710
What?

916
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,170
Where the...

917
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,010
Oh!

918
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,870
Oh, now we're even more realistic.

919
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:30,690
We're in a home!

920
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:32,630
Whoa!

921
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,490
We're in a home now!

922
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:39,690
Okay.

923
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:41,930
Alright, they placed the bomb.

924
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,050
Oh my god, this is so realistic.

925
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,270
Oh boy.

926
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:49,010
We have pistols though.

927
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:50,530
Whoa.

928
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:52,370
Don't worry.

929
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,870
Guys, I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm contributing...

930
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:56,750
to the cause.

931
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,760
AHHHHH!

932
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,480
I...

933
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,520
What?

934
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,200
What happened?

935
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,820
Did I got kicked out?

936
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:15,840
What?

937
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,420
What?

938
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:18,660
What?

939
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,200
What happened?

940
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,940
Did I...

941
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,460
Oh, I got kicked out.

942
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,000
Oh, was it cause he was a teammate?

943
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,040
Oh...

944
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,340
I got kicked out...

945
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,720
because it was a teammate.

946
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,660
I got kicked out...

947
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,480
I thought he was a...

948
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,680
I thought he was the enemy.

949
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,700
Oh no!

950
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,720
I'm sorry.

951
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,180
I was so confused.

952
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,740
Okay.

953
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,360
Thank you for the super chat.

954
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:54,760
Thank you.

955
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,120
Hello, JokeyBird.

956
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,740
I haven't seen you in a while because of your brutal streaming hours for EU.

957
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,040
No!

958
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,000
I'm sorry!

959
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:02,740
I hate that!

960
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,280
Thank you for the super chat.

961
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,820
Why is your streamlabs donation message, Donator stole from your wallet instead of Jokey stole?

962
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,800
Because you stole from another person just to give money to me.

963
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,580
That's why.

964
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,560
Thank you for the super chat.

965
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:15,940
Thank you.

966
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,860
Okay, well...

967
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,540
Well, like, that was a little awkward.

968
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,560
I'm sorry.

969
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:22,540
No!

970
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,060
No!

971
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,800
I can't believe it!

972
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,980
They fucking kicked me out!

973
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,080
It was too realistic!

974
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,660
They kicked me out!

975
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,360
Alright.

976
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,560
Let's see.

977
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,720
Okay, we're gonna do a tumblewood.

978
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,260
I'm creating my own lobby.

979
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,840
There we go.

980
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,500
Is that it?

981
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,360
Is that all I have to do?

982
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,200
I'm by myself.

983
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,180
I have no friends.

984
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,320
Oh no.

985
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,960
Maybe team deathmatch is pretty neat.

986
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,580
Yeah, maybe it is.

987
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,420
Yeah, maybe this is what...

988
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,540
Alright, I'm gonna make my own match.

989
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,600
You can't kick me out if I own the lobby!

990
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,000
That's fucking right.

991
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,560
You can't kick me out now.

992
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,700
That's fucking right!

993
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,020
You can't kick me out now If I own this lobby!

994
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:19,920
AHAHAHAHAHA!

995
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,180
aHAHAHAHAHA!

996
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,400
look at that 100k streamlabs!

997
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,220
That's fucking right!

998
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,680
I wanted to play the woods.

999
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,380
The woods was what I saw in the trailer.

1000
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,420
It was what looked so cool!

1001
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:35,620
Alright.

1002
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,620
Let's see.

1003
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,580
Where are the people?

1004
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:39,460
Hello?

1005
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:40,980
Hello?

1006
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,880
Where are you guys?

1007
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,100
Guys, you wouldn't let me die, right?

1008
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,320
Guys?

1009
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:51,540
Guys?

1010
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,820
There's no way you can hear me.

1011
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,780
There's no way you guys have the ears to know...

1012
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,980
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1013
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:07,410
Is that you?

1014
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:08,830
Did I get him?

1015
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:11,310
Guys, I don't think I got him.

1016
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:16,270
Oh, it's so real.

1017
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,590
It's so real.

1018
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,710
Wait, here's a drone.

1019
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:22,910
I don't think he sees me.

1020
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:24,530
I don't think...

1021
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:25,950
I don't think he sees me, guys.

1022
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,590
Guys, I don't think he saw me.

1023
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:38,190
How did he see me?

1024
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,210
I don't understand!

1025
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:44,670
How?

1026
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:48,730
How did he see me?

1027
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:53,670
There's no way!

1028
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:58,030
Oh my god, this is so... wait, is that my dead body?

1029
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:01,150
No, I don't think I died there, right?

1030
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:04,270
Where the fuck are these people?

1031
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:07,670
There's no way!

1032
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:08,690
He must be hacking!

1033
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:10,430
How did he see me?

1034
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,520
I can't believe he saw me!

1035
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,840
Alan, just die so we can, like, play the game, Alan.

1036
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,180
Alan!

1037
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:25,540
Alan!

1038
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,920
Just let them kill you, it's over.

1039
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,160
It's fucking over, Alan.

1040
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,060
None of us have kills, Alan!

1041
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,820
Just... just accept it!

1042
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,800
Alright, where is he?

1043
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,480
How are you gonna shoot any... someone from all the...

1044
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,580
Wait, where is he?

1045
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,140
Where... fuck, he's so far!

1046
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,740
Alright, let's do, like, POV.

1047
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,540
I said POV.

1048
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,460
Alan, get there!

1049
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:56,900
Get over...

1050
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:56,960
Oh!

1051
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:59,860
Wait, did Alan win?

1052
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,660
Wait, Alan won!

1053
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,500
Holy shit!

1054
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,700
Did you let your big brother play the video game?

1055
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:10,260
Okay.

1056
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:14,770
Alright.

1057
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:17,150
I can't believe Alan won.

1058
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:19,050
He actually... we have nades?

1059
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:23,190
Oh my god, we have nades.

1060
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:34,050
We have nades.

1061
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:34,250
Alright.

1062
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:37,790
Let's just follow... let's follow Emu.

1063
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:42,730
Wait, it's snowing now.

1064
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:45,070
Alright.

1065
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:48,110
Don't worry, I won't team kill.

1066
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:52,130
I own this lobby anyway, so how am I supposed to team kill?

1067
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,550
I think I only get, like, one bomb.

1068
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:57,030
I'm pretty sure.

1069
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:59,150
This shit is so...

1070
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:00,850
Okay.

1071
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:04,510
Guys, I'm gaming.

1072
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:07,830
Guys, I don't know where he... is that him?

1073
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:10,610
Is that a person?

1074
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:14,950
Is that... is that a person?

1075
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:16,190
Reloading.

1076
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:18,190
I'm getting shot to my side.

1077
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:21,650
Where?

1078
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:24,050
Oh no, I'm scared.

1079
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:26,230
How do you see that?

1080
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:28,970
Where did he get?

1081
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:29,190
Where he got shot?

1082
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:30,590
Minute!

1083
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,480
Oh, there he...

1084
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:35,860
No!

1085
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,040
Oh my god!

1086
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,060
There is so...

1087
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:44,260
Guys, the forest was a bad idea, guys.

1088
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,780
The forest was a bad idea.

1089
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,840
The forest.

1090
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,900
I thought it would be cool, but...

1091
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,740
but it's so hard to see anybody, guys.

1092
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:04,500
Oh my god.

1093
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,080
Did I kill one?

1094
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,380
I did!

1095
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:10,200
No, that's not me guys.

1096
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,220
That's Alan and Emu.

1097
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,920
That's Alan and Emu.

1098
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:16,100
Alright.

1099
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,180
Wait, I have a better gun now.

1100
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,320
Alright.

1101
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,880
Look for the movement.

1102
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,900
But like everybody is like camouflaged.

1103
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:29,880
How do I look for movement when I can barely see myself?

1104
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,820
Okay, that's an invisible wall.

1105
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,420
Okay, invisible walls exist in the forest.

1106
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:37,440
That's good to know.

1107
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,440
That's good to know.

1108
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,640
Oh my god.

1109
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,420
This is for people who really love realism.

1110
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:49,020
This shit is hard.

1111
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,960
You actually have to be so fucking patient.

1112
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,360
I'm one of the grass.

1113
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:55,880
There's no way I'm going to die.

1114
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:56,780
There's no way they see me here.

1115
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,320
If they do, they're actually cheating.

1116
00:46:59,240 --> 00:46:59,760
Like...

1117
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,460
I'm going to make noise.

1118
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:05,820
Okay.

1119
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:07,420
Alright.

1120
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:09,640
Anybody there?

1121
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,640
Anybody there?

1122
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:15,460
Oh, it's so scary.

1123
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,420
It's like a horror game.

1124
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,520
Watch my flanks.

1125
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,860
I have to watch behind us too?

1126
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:27,360
Oh my god.

1127
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:28,300
Please.

1128
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,500
We're so sneaky.

1129
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,820
I hear no gunshots.

1130
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:37,690
I'm leaning.

1131
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:40,050
Oh, I hear nothing.

1132
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:42,370
I don't like that.

1133
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:45,430
I don't like that.

1134
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:46,290
I don't hear anything.

1135
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,240
Guys, this is not like Apex at all.

1136
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,520
Alright, my goal right now is to get one kill.

1137
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:56,560
That's all.

1138
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,440
I don't ask for much.

1139
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:17,130
Guys, I think I'm losing blood.

1140
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:20,870
Guys, I think I'm losing blood.

1141
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:25,130

00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:25,950
I killed him!

1143
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:26,690
I got my one kill!

1144
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:29,830
Alright, this is peak gaming.

1145
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:30,590
10 out of 10.

1146
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:32,730
I got my one kill.

1147
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:36,530
Where did I kill this?

1148
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:37,290
Is that him?

1149
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:38,930
What?

1150
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:46,330
Was that a person?

1151
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:51,530
Where did I die?

1152
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:00,770
Guys, I think that was a real person.

1153
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:03,190

1154
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:03,890

1155
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:07,730
I think that was a real person.

1156
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:08,050
I think that was a real person.

1157
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:10,010
I don't know.

1158
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,250
I couldn't tell.

1159
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:14,710
It's so hard to tell.

1160
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:15,590
Chat.

1161
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:16,470

1163
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:21,010

1164
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:22,710

00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:36,910
It's so scary!

1170
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:38,710
It's so scary!

1171
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:47,160
Oh my god, this game is actually Oh my god, this game is actually fucking...

00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,160
It's like half horror.

00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,100
The tree is talking.

1174
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:54,120
Cause it's like...

1175
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:57,620

It's trees were all so camouflaged too!

1177
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,940

I gotta like become one with the trees!

1179
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,540
I don't understand!

1180
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,620
How did he know?

1181
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,780
I don't understand.

1182
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:13,520

1196
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:48,980
Oh, goodbye.

00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:53,200
No, I can actually hear him bleed out!

1198
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,260
Did you guys hear that?

1199
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,640

1205
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,120

1206
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:15,820
Okay.

Alright, 10.

00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:18,860
Alright.

They bleed out!

1210
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,280
That's so realistic!

1211
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:24,580
I'm gonna run.

1212
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:26,500
There's no way.

1213
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:29,160
Okay, wait, wait.

1214
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:29,760

00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,340
Is there prone here?

1216
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:33,820
In this game?

1217
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,120
Oh my god.

1218
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:43,380
This is for people who wanna be like super serious.

1219
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:49,550
Where are we running to?

1220
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:50,130
I don't know.

1221
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:54,530
I'm letting my legs take me to places where I never knew existed.

1222
00:51:55,330 --> 00:51:55,730
Hahaha!

1223
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:56,790
Hahaha!

1224
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:00,770

1226
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:03,730
Oh!

1227
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:08,610
You think I got him?

1228
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:11,190
No.

1229
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:14,410
You think they know I'm here?

1230
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:18,290
You think they know I'm here?

1231
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:19,810
You...

1232
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:27,310
I don't think they knew.

1233
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:29,670
Guys, I don't think they knew.

1234
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:31,490
Guys, no no no no no.

1235
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:33,730
I don't think they knew guys.

1236
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:35,310
I can keep walking.

1237
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:37,470
They don't know.

1238
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:40,530
Oh!

1239
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:42,750
They don't know chat.

1240
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:46,510
I can keep sneaking behind them.

1241
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:49,070
Yes, they don't know.

1242
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,110
Oh shit!

1243
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:52,290
Stop!

1244
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:53,250
Leave me alone!

1245
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:54,270
Drop!

1246
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:56,930
You're gonna ruin my surprise!

1247
00:52:57,890 --> 00:52:58,370
Stop!

1248
00:52:58,390 --> 00:52:59,410
You have a flashlight!

1249
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:00,630
Hahaha!

1250
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:04,450
Wait, that's the enemy drone.

1251
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:05,570
Oh shit!

1252
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:06,590
I think they're gonna know now.

1253
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:10,050
Oh no.

1254
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:12,670
No, they don't know I'm here guys.

1255
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:14,570
There's no way.

1256
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:15,810
There's no way.

1257
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:17,530
They're not gonna tell them that I'm here.

1258
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:21,150
There's no way they're gonna tell them.

1259
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:22,190
There's no way they're gonna tell them.

1260
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:23,570
Where are they?

1261
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:27,210
They said body's here.

1262
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:32,250
Dragonborn Emu!

1263
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:32,450
Dragonborn Emu!

1264
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:37,840
That's my teammate.

1265
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:38,520
Oh no!

1266
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:39,940
Ah!

1267
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,060
He whiffed and then I whiffed!

1268
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:49,740
And then he got me!

1269
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,120
No!

1270
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:54,420
Hahaha!

1271
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:57,660
We both whiffed!

1272
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,660
But he whiffed less!

1273
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:01,200
Hahaha!

1274
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,080
No!

1275
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:06,640
Kick him out!

1276
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:07,360
He's too good!

1277
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:08,280
Hahaha!

1278
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:11,390
Hahaha!

1279
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,430
He's too good!

1280
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:15,930
Hahaha!

1281
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:19,750
I refuse to let these good players!

1282
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,050
And I'm joking.

1283
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:22,350
Oh there he is.

1284
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:22,930
No!

1285
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:24,790
I bumped my head on a tree!

1286
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:25,890
Hahaha!

1287
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:27,370
Hahaha!

1288
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:28,710
Oh we did it!

1289
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:29,150
We won!

1290
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:29,830
Yippee!

1291
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:31,590
Oh wait I can!

1292
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:33,710
Wait can I actually kick people out?

1293
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:35,710
That would be pretty funny.

1294
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:36,670
Wait can I?

1295
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:39,990
Can I actually?

1296
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:43,870
What if I just swap teams?

1297
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:45,190
What if I?

1298
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:46,290
Hahaha!

1299
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:48,730
What if I just leave this team?

1300
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:49,670
Hahaha!

1301
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:53,140
Hahaha!

1302
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,040
Hahaha!

1303
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,100
Toki no!

1304
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,020
I can switch teams whenever I want!

1305
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:01,780
Hahaha!

1306
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:03,220
Hahaha!

1307
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,060
Alright if this team starts losing we're swapping.

1308
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:08,300
Hahaha!

1309
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,020
You went when you should have!

1310
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:10,500
Nay nay!

1311
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:11,920
Can't say thank you in the super chat!

1312
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:12,300
Thank you!

1313
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,380
Oh my god what gun is this?

1314
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,240
I'm gonna look at my controls.

1315
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:17,520
Guys!

1316
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:19,180

1318
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:20,860
Truce!

1319
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:24,100
The host has to look at her controls real quick.

1320
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:24,960
The host has to look at her controls real quick.

1321
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:26,680
Key bindings.

1322
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:33,800
Okay we have fire, aim, flashlight, inspect, drop items, swap, jump, jog.

1323
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:35,240
We have jog?

1324
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:38,760
What does jog look like?

1325
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,820
What does jog look like?

1326
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,480
What's the difference between jog and sprint?

1327
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:45,580
What's the difference between jog and sprint?

1328
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:46,620
It's the same speed!

1329
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:49,060
Okay.

1330
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:49,580
Okay.

1331
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:52,880
I hear him.

1332
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,680
Like right over here.

1333
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:56,660
I don't know.

1334
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,240
There's no way they know.

1335
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:00,700
I'm like super silent.

1336
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,080
There's no way I can...

1337
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:06,500
I don't know.

1338
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,300
I don't know.

1339
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,020
I got him!

1340
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:13,340
I got him!

1341
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:13,880
I think I got him!

1342
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,040
I got him!

1343
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:15,380
I got him!

1344
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:15,720
I got him!

1345
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:16,400
I got him!

1346
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:18,260
Oh my god I'm better!

1347
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,920
I'm so much better!

1348
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:20,740
I fucking did it!

1349
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:21,240
I sneaked!

1350
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:22,760
I sneaked it!

1351
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:24,700
Okay.

1352
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:26,680
Alright we're winning this.

1353
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:29,900
They don't know.

1354
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:32,720
They don't fucking know.

1355
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:33,920
They don't fucking know.

1356
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,100
I'm part of the fucking rocks.

1357
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,440
I'm part of the rocks.

1358
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:42,680
Okay.

1359
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:45,060
Where are they?

1360
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:45,980
Hello?

1361
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:48,300
Hello guys!

1362
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:52,320
Where's my teammate?

1363
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:57,240
I think what I'm scared about is that I don't know where my teammates are.

1364
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,220
I don't know if I'm the last remaining...

1365
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:02,320
I'm the last remaining guy here.

1366
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:04,420
That's so slow.

1367
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:08,780
Oh I hear shots in front of me.

1368
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,160
I hear shots.

1369
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,220
Okay slow and steady.

1370
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:15,420
They won't know I'm part of the bushes.

1371
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:20,000
They won't know I'm part of the bushes.

1372
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,260
I'm part of the trees.

1373
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:22,060
I'm part of the trees.

1374
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:23,600
That person?

1375
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:24,640
No.

1376
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:30,160
Sneaky sneaky.

1377
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:32,600
Sneaky sneaky.

1378
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:36,780
But I also don't know either.

1379
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:38,360
But I also don't know either.

1380
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,860
Is that a person?

1381
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:45,390
Did I?

1382
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:47,170
No.

1383
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:50,930
Oh no I heard gunshots this way too.

1384
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:53,370
Am I the last one?

1385
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:56,310
No!

1386
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:00,200
No!

1387
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,860
I can't believe it!

1388
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,300
I was the last one!

1389
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:19,140
No!

1390
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,760
I was the last one!

1391
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,480
SarahFace says no.

1392
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:28,240
They can put the 20, get the chest!

1393
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:29,640
Thank you, thank you.

1394
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,280
Bro they naded me?

1395
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:34,400
How?

1396
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:37,800
Okay.

1397
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,080
Don't worry I got my own nade too emu.

1398
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:41,540
Don't worry.

1399
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:43,280
I'm holding it right now.

1400
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:44,040
I think.

1401
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,460
Don't worry, Emu.

1402
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:46,560
I got a nade as well.

1403
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,140
I got you.

1404
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:52,140
Where are they?

1405
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:54,140
Holy shit.

1406
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:56,360
Don't worry, Emu.

1407
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,480
I got you.

1408
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:02,140
I have a nade as well.

1409
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:06,960
No matter what happens, Emu, I will throw my nade for you.

1410
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:13,440
I'll throw my nade and then you do the rest.

1411
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,280
Did we do it?

1412
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:20,380
Did we do it?

1413
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,820
Did we do it?

1414
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:23,960
Emu, did we do it?

1415
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:24,780
I can't tell.

1416
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:26,040
Did we do it?

1417
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:26,640
Is he dead?

1418
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,060
Emu, I'm bleeding out.

1419
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,020
Emu, I need you.

1420
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:33,820
I'm bleeding out, Emu.

1421
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:36,100
No, I didn't do it!

1422
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:40,100
I'm bleeding out.

1423
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:40,860
I broke the camera though.

1424
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:42,000
I did my job.

1425
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,700
I broke the camera, but I'm definitely gonna die.

1426
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:47,880
Emu, please.

1427
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,340
Emu, please.

1428
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:50,540
I'm gonna die, Emu.

1429
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:55,460
I'm slowly bleeding out.

1430
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:00,920
Oh no, I feel so cold.

1431
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:04,420
What did I steal?

1432
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:06,680
Oh, it's the same gun.

1433
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:08,580
Emu, please.

1434
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:08,820
Emu, please.

1435
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:11,240
It's getting so cold, Emu!

1436
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:15,180
I'm... thank you for the superchat.

1437
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:16,120
Thank you, thank you.

1438
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,860
It's getting so cold.

1439
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:20,060
I think I see the light.

1440
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:24,620
That was a friendly drone?

1441
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,100
All drones are unfriendly.

1442
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:31,040
There's no such thing as a friendly drone.

1443
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:37,310
Oh!

1444
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:41,550
My little head!

1445
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:43,690
My little head!

1446
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:44,470
Also a friendly drone.

1447
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:45,210
That's not friendly!

1448
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:46,270
No!

1449
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,560
The drone distracted me!

1450
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:55,580
I was looking at the drone!

1451
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,500
It's not fair.

1452
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,960
I was looking at the fucking drone.

1453
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:08,380
I was like, oh hey, that's not a friendly drone.

1454
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:09,400
The fuck is that?

1455
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:15,200
Yes, he's over here!

1456
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:17,420
I'm over here!

1457
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:18,380
Guys, Emo!

1458
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:20,440
Emo!

1459
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,020
He's over here, Emo!

1460
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:24,500
Right here!

1461
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,380
Emo, please!

1462
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:28,300
Clutch this!

1463
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:31,200
At least I'm not that guy with zero kills.

1464
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,400
I think he just joined the lobby.

1465
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:36,480
At least I'm not like him.

1466
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:38,740
It's okay.

1467
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:41,060
If all else fails, I can always switch teams.

1468
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,120
Oh, I can do a light!

1469
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:49,800
He's right here!

1470
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:52,920
He's right here, Emo!

1471
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:55,060
He's right here!

1472
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:55,860
He's right here!

1473
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:57,040
Lord Flamo!

1474
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:57,800
Who the fuck?

1475
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:58,780
Wait, Emo's dead?

1476
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:00,380
He's right here!

1477
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:03,140
Oh my god, please!

1478
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:04,520
Look at each other!

1479
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:05,440
Did we do it?

1480
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:06,040
We did it!

1481
01:02:10,590 --> 01:02:10,990
Let's go!

1482
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:14,850
Let's go!

1483
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:15,630
Alright, boys.

1484
01:02:16,330 --> 01:02:17,110
We did it.

1485
01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:18,770
We're spread out.

1486
01:02:20,830 --> 01:02:21,710
Alright, let's go.

1487
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:24,210
We're doing it.

1488
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:25,790
Daniel, thank you for the super chat!

1489
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:26,090
Thank you!

1490
01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:29,410
Wait, oh my god.

1491
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:33,390
I thought I had like proximity chat on this entire time.

1492
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:33,650
I thought I had like proximity chat on this entire time.

1493
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:36,170
Because the left side started going...

1494
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:37,150
Daniel, sorry.

1495
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:38,190
Welcome to the tomato farm.

1496
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:38,830
Welcome, welcome.

1497
01:02:39,110 --> 01:02:40,390
But it was just that one guy.

1498
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:41,410
That was talking to us.

1499
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:44,230
I was like, oh my god, they heard me screaming this entire time.

1500
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:44,810
I was like...

1501
01:02:47,570 --> 01:02:47,930
No.

1502
01:02:48,190 --> 01:02:48,910
No, I'm not.

1503
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:49,350
I'm not.

1504
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:50,230
Oh, thank god.

1505
01:02:53,030 --> 01:02:55,290
Dude, I didn't imagine if I was though.

1506
01:02:55,930 --> 01:02:59,070
I was like, actually like, oh my god, was I open mic this entire time?

1507
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:05,950
Wait, you can use proximity chat to troll them?

1508
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:08,070
Oh my god, let's do it.

1509
01:03:08,370 --> 01:03:10,310
Okay, when I die, we're gonna troll the other guys.

1510
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:12,110
Okay, when I die, we're gonna troll the other guys.

1511
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:12,790
Okay.

1512
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:14,730
We're fine.

1513
01:03:15,070 --> 01:03:16,050
Oh, we have an AK.

1514
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:17,930
I think this is an AK.

1515
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:19,710
I mean, it has that brown thing.

1516
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:22,050
Oh my god, I'm stuck.

1517
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:24,050
These trees.

1518
01:03:24,850 --> 01:03:26,250
These god damn trees.

1519
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:28,590
Okay.

1520
01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:33,030
Who's that behind me?

1521
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:35,350
I hear people.

1522
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:35,790
What?

1523
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:40,430
What the fuck?

1524
01:03:40,430 --> 01:03:41,670
Die!

1525
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,240
What?

1526
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:49,760
That was so fast!

1527
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:53,120
Bro, that got one tapped me!

1528
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:57,400
They're in the trees.

1529
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:02,100
Wait, where is the...

1530
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:03,520
Where's my teammate?

1531
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:03,860
Okay.

1532
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:05,440
Wait, wait, wait.

1533
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,260
What are you doing?

1534
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:14,800
Bro, what the...

1535
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,020
Go up!

1536
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:24,440
Go up!

1537
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:24,620
Go up...!

1538
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:26,500
Wait, where's the enemy?

1539
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:27,020
Where's the enemy?

1540
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:28,880
I lost the... Oh, he's right here!

1541
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:40,410
We only have... It's a 1v1, I think.

1542
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:41,230
We only have... It's a 1v1, I think.

1543
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:44,150
Boo!

1544
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:45,390
Boo!

1545
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:47,450
Boo!

1546
01:04:47,770 --> 01:04:48,270
Boo!

1547
01:04:48,270 --> 01:04:48,550
Boo!

1548
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:49,050
Boo!

1549
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:51,050
Boo!

1550
01:04:53,950 --> 01:04:55,350
Boo.

1551
01:04:58,430 --> 01:04:59,830
Boo.

1552
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:26,020
Boo.

1553
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:27,200
Boo.

1554
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:29,080
Please!

1555
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:34,040
Oh thank god, okay I just got him.

1556
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:36,700
He killed the other one.

1557
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:37,700
The other drone.

1558
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:38,780
That's hilarious.

1559
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:46,620
Yay!

1560
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,280
I helped!

1561
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,500
I helped!

1562
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,280
Guys, help!

1563
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,120
The drone keeps saying boo!

1564
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,580
Not the drone.

1565
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,280
Guys, I helped!

1566
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:15,720
Guys, the distraction!

1567
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,820
The distraction works!

1568
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:22,060
The distraction works, guys!

1569
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:23,600
I told you!

1570
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,420
It fucking works!

1571
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:32,850
That was the most fun.

1572
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:36,110
Like as long as I can terrorize other people, that's all.

1573
01:06:36,270 --> 01:06:37,190
I'm happy.

1574
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:43,330
As long as I can grief in some shape or form, I'm satisfied.

1575
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:46,070
Okay.

1576
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:49,370
The tea bag of the drone.

1577
01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:52,170
Wait, can I like clip through this?

1578
01:06:52,490 --> 01:06:52,970
Okay.

1579
01:06:53,850 --> 01:06:54,570
New meta.

1580
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:00,350
Oh my god, I see him.

1581
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:03,730
Oh my god, I feel like he's gonna hit me.

1582
01:07:03,930 --> 01:07:04,930
I'm gonna get cover here.

1583
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:05,910
Whoa.

1584
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:08,870
I'm so scared.

1585
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:12,650
No, what?!

1586
01:07:12,650 --> 01:07:14,070
Holy shit!

1587
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:17,130
He shot me from all the way there?!

1588
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:18,570
Oh, it's okay.

1589
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:20,390
Wait, who killed me?

1590
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:22,830
Holy shit!

1591
01:07:22,950 --> 01:07:23,530
He's over... okay.

1592
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:24,530
Don't worry.

1593
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:28,270
Oh, no, he really doesn't want me alive.

1594
01:07:28,830 --> 01:07:30,590
Oh, he's trying to kill me now.

1595
01:07:32,410 --> 01:07:32,890
Okay.

1596
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:38,330
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, he's trying to kill this drone.

1597
01:07:38,490 --> 01:07:38,730
Whoa!

1598
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:41,170
Guys, I'm scared.

1599
01:07:41,210 --> 01:07:41,910
This guy actually...

1600
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:45,590
Ah, no!

1601
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:50,260
I...

1602
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:52,140
I landed on...

1603
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:54,800
I crashed into the floor.

1604
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:58,620
I crashed into the fucking floor.

1605
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:03,800
DW, welcome to the tomato farm.

1606
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:04,720
Welcome to the tomato farm.

1607
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:05,200
Welcome!

1608
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:07,260
Oh my god!

1609
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:10,240
I crashed into the floor!

1610
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,100
I can't believe it.

1611
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:19,220
I can't believe it!

1612
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:19,760
Alright.

1613
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:24,220
Okay guys, we gotta... we gotta be a team guys.

1614
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:26,200
We gotta work together everybody!

1615
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:35,320
I'm surprised another drone crashed onto the floor cause she wanted to yell boo.

1616
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:42,700
We can't always have nice things chat.

1617
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:44,220
Okay.

1618
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:46,260
Alright.

1619
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:50,680
It's snowing again.

1620
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:54,700
Oh it's always snowing on Mount Fuji.

1621
01:08:57,260 --> 01:09:01,300
Okay there's no way they can see me with their special eyes.

1622
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:03,300
Guys I...

1623
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:05,720
Okay I have the least kills.

1624
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:05,940
Okay.

1625
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:08,880
Never mind.

1626
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:12,200
How are these people so good at this game?

1627
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:17,400
It's like... it's like they've actually played tactical shooters!

1628
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,060
How are they so tactical?

1629
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:26,260
I don't understand.

1630
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:30,200
How are these people so fucking goddamn tact...

1631
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:30,440
No!

1632
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:36,280
I saw him!

1633
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,320
I saw him too!

1634
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,560
But he saw me first!

1635
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:45,440
He fucking saw me first!

1636
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:47,880
Ah, damn it!

1637
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:51,980
I stared at him... and he stared at me.

1638
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:57,160
I know my place.

1639
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,180
And it's a drone.

1640
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:00,420
It's okay.

1641
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:01,460
I'm here to provide intel.

1642
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,400
I provide intel guys.

1643
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:07,460
Right here where is he?

1644
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:10,180
I'm the intel provider.

1645
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:12,560
I know my worth.

1646
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:14,460
Where is he though?

1647
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:18,080
I hear him.

1648
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:20,340
Boo.

1649
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:27,940
Hey.

1650
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:29,580
Hey.

1651
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:31,020
Hey.

1652
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:33,460
Hey.

1653
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:33,560
Hey.

1654
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:39,160
He's over here.

1655
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:41,940
No!

1656
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:52,360
Stop it.

1657
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:55,300
No!

1658
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:01,940
No fun!

1659
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:04,460
I can't believe it!

1660
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:06,140
My team hit me!

1661
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:07,180
My drone!

1662
01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:10,810
Damage!

1663
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:17,610
I can't believe I got hit by the Kalei!

1664
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:20,550
That's unfair!

1665
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:26,650
I got hit by the Kalei.

1666
01:11:31,030 --> 01:11:32,210
It's too realistic.

1667
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:37,990
What the fuck?

1668
01:11:38,030 --> 01:11:39,490
They're actually strategizing?

1669
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:40,770
I don't know what I'm doing.

1670
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:42,890
What do you mean?

1671
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:47,010
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

1672
01:11:47,210 --> 01:11:47,490
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

1673
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:50,790
I'm just fucking existing.

1674
01:11:51,470 --> 01:11:51,830
I'm just fucking existing.

1675
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:52,170
I'm just fucking existing.

1676
01:11:53,490 --> 01:11:53,970
Yeah.

1677
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:56,190
Don't worry, Emu.

1678
01:11:56,530 --> 01:11:57,470
You and me.

1679
01:12:00,510 --> 01:12:02,050
Actual comms, I know, right?

1680
01:12:03,770 --> 01:12:06,130
Oh my god, this other guy is talking a lot though.

1681
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:11,260
Just hug the trees.

1682
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:12,520
I see them.

1683
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:14,220
I don't think he sees me.

1684
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,320
I don't think he sees me.

1685
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:18,980
I'm gonna stay behind this big tree just in case.

1686
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:22,260
Oh no, I'm scared.

1687
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:24,920
I'm scared.

1688
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:29,220
Mr. Kra- I don't wanna get accidentally headshot!

1689
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:33,980
Okay.

1690
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:35,540
Safe tree.

1691
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:37,180
Safe tree.

1692
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,100
Oh my god, this tree is safe.

1693
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:41,320
Hello?

1694
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,120
This is my safe tree.

1695
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:46,820
Is somebody to my left?

1696
01:12:51,010 --> 01:12:52,030
I'm so scared.

1697
01:12:53,350 --> 01:12:54,890
I don't feel safe, guys.

1698
01:12:56,010 --> 01:13:00,330
I call this my safe tree, but for some reason, this does not feel safe.

1699
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:03,810
Oh god.

1700
01:13:04,530 --> 01:13:05,690
Is that my drone?

1701
01:13:07,570 --> 01:13:08,510
No, it's not.

1702
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:10,190
Wait, he's like...

1703
01:13:12,270 --> 01:13:14,210
Wait, did you hear that?

1704
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:16,970
The drone was like...

1705
01:13:16,970 --> 01:13:24,430
Oh my god.

1706
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:27,270
Where is it?

1707
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:29,330
Then he got shot.

1708
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:31,930
Famous last words.

1709
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:37,450
My safe tree.

1710
01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:39,010
My safety place.

1711
01:13:39,330 --> 01:13:40,170
I'm so scared.

1712
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:43,250
You gotta come to me if you wanna kill me.

1713
01:13:46,570 --> 01:13:47,730
Oh no.

1714
01:13:48,950 --> 01:13:49,930
Oh no.

1715
01:13:50,650 --> 01:13:52,290
Yeah, come over here.

1716
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:54,610
Behind the safe tree.

1717
01:13:55,250 --> 01:13:57,510
They're like somewhere over on the side.

1718
01:13:58,770 --> 01:13:59,410
They're like somewhere over on the side.

1719
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:01,050
They're stealing my tactics.

1720
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:05,530
I mean, to be fair, they were pretty good tactics, so...

1721
01:14:06,870 --> 01:14:07,850
Did he know?

1722
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:08,350
Did he know?

1723
01:14:10,370 --> 01:14:11,870
Can you see me?

1724
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:13,470
No!

1725
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:26,110
I left the safety of the trees.

1726
01:14:26,370 --> 01:14:27,170
I left...

1727
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:31,210
I left the safety of the trees.

1728
01:14:32,590 --> 01:14:34,990
Never leave the trees.

1729
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:44,920
Who?

1730
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:48,660
Hahahaha!

1731
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,300
Did you guys hear that?

1732
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:58,000
Hahahaha!

1733
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:00,200
Did you...

1734
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:01,660
Did you guys hear him?

1735
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:02,480
He was like...

1736
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:03,360
leave me alone.

1737
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:08,900
Oh my god.

1738
01:15:12,030 --> 01:15:14,450
Oh my god, he was like, leave me alone!

1739
01:15:15,490 --> 01:15:16,170
Hahahaha!

1740
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:19,610
Oh my god.

1741
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:23,730
Oh my god.

1742
01:15:23,910 --> 01:15:25,270
What a menace!

1743
01:15:25,710 --> 01:15:27,130
Wait, where is he?

1744
01:15:27,210 --> 01:15:29,170
I don't want to leave him alone after you said that.

1745
01:15:29,270 --> 01:15:30,930
Now I definitely won't leave him.

1746
01:15:31,010 --> 01:15:31,130
No!

1747
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:33,670
Guys, I bumped into a tree.

1748
01:15:37,410 --> 01:15:39,470
The voices, make it stop!

1749
01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:41,010
Make the...

1750
01:15:42,990 --> 01:15:44,630
Make the voices stop!

1751
01:15:45,370 --> 01:15:46,690
Alright, which way is right?

1752
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:47,530
This way.

1753
01:15:47,790 --> 01:15:48,230
Okay.

1754
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:50,790
The tree...

1755
01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:52,810
VH, VH...

1756
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:57,070
And now I don't want to leave him alone.

1757
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:06,360
I don't know if like running straight right is like the best idea.

1758
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:07,940
But okay.

1759
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:11,160
Is this cover?

1760
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:12,800
Whoa!

1761
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:15,840
What if they ran left?

1762
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:22,900
I'm scared.

1763
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:26,880
Guys, I'm scared.

1764
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:28,500
Guys.

1765
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:30,260
I'm scared.

1766
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,440
I'm only helpful in drone form.

1767
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:34,200
Guys, I don't know when I'm physical.

1768
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:35,500
But I'm...

1769
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:40,940
What do I do when I'm a physical flesh being?

1770
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:46,820
I'm not used to this.

1771
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:56,330
I don't see them.

1772
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:59,250
Wait, my teammates are dead.

1773
01:17:00,530 --> 01:17:02,030
My teammates are dead.

1774
01:17:06,820 --> 01:17:07,840
Where are they?

1775
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:13,060
Oh no, Emu.

1776
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:14,200
I'm scared, Emu.

1777
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:19,400
Wait, that's... Those are enemy drones.

1778
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:21,080
Emu, I'm scared.

1779
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:29,280
Where are they?

1780
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:39,670
Where's left flank?

1781
01:17:43,610 --> 01:17:44,210
Oh!

1782
01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:47,090
That's my right!

1783
01:17:48,810 --> 01:17:50,150
That's my right!

1784
01:17:52,290 --> 01:17:54,430
What do you mean left flank?

1785
01:17:54,430 --> 01:17:57,090
That's my right side!

1786
01:17:57,450 --> 01:17:59,430
On his left!

1787
01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:09,690
That's the fucking right side!

1788
01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:14,190
It's...

1789
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:16,390
On their left!

1790
01:18:16,490 --> 01:18:17,190
Front!

1791
01:18:18,150 --> 01:18:19,550
Front!

1792
01:18:20,150 --> 01:18:21,550
Front!

1793
01:18:25,010 --> 01:18:28,170
I assume he's gonna use my directions!

1794
01:18:31,070 --> 01:18:36,710
What the fuck do you mean left?

1795
01:18:41,290 --> 01:18:42,250
I see...

1796
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:48,180
Oh my god!

1797
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:48,920
I got a kill!

1798
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:50,380
I got a kill!

1799
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,740
I got... I did it!

1800
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:54,760
Boo!

1801
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:00,240
Guys,

1802
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:11,300
I don't think they like you.

1803
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:17,600
Guys, I don't think they like me.

1804
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:24,220
Every time he got me.

1805
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:24,780
It's okay guys.

1806
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,780
But what if I swap teams?

1807
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:31,300
What if I just switch teams?

1808
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:32,620
Did I swap?

1809
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,540
Oh my god, did I actually swap?

1810
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:37,220
Where am I?

1811
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:39,860
Wait, how do I swap?

1812
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:42,220
How do I swap?

1813
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:42,380
Swap!

1814
01:19:46,910 --> 01:19:47,240
No!

1815
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:48,740
It's full!

1816
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:57,740
I just wanted to be...

1817
01:19:57,740 --> 01:19:58,420
Whoa!

1818
01:20:02,470 --> 01:20:02,800
No!

1819
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:04,980
Never say thank you in the super chat.

1820
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:05,340
Thank you.

1821
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:06,960
Rookie mistake.

1822
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:09,240
I assume Doki is facing the enemies.

1823
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:11,020
No!

1824
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:15,680
I wanna be on their team!

1825
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:19,360
Cause they're winning!

1826
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:26,680
I just wanna be a winner!

1827
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,360
Okay, I'm gonna follow Alan and get him killed.

1828
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,400
Doki can't be cool.

1829
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:38,620
Okay, but what if like... I'm gonna hide behind that big tree.

1830
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:40,820
There's no way they know I'm here.

1831
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:42,960
A big tree.

1832
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:46,540
Oh, I hear people dead.

1833
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:51,620
This is the comeback of the century.

1834
01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:55,140
As soon as I figure out how to get past this tree.

1835
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:59,520
Cause it ain't looking so good for me right now.

1836
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:03,340
Oh no.

1837
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:05,220
Oh no.

1838
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:11,440
I saw that... the guy that was like, leave me alone!

1839
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:14,740
That's the lizard free in my head.

1840
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:16,740
That shit was so funny.

1841
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:18,160
Leave me alone.

1842
01:21:28,270 --> 01:21:28,870
Alright.

1843
01:21:29,850 --> 01:21:30,930
So realistic.

1844
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:33,550
He doesn't know I'm here.

1845
01:21:36,470 --> 01:21:37,410
They got the kill?

1846
01:21:37,770 --> 01:21:38,590
I did!

1847
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:43,080
I got the kill!

1848
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,320
I fled, guys!

1849
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,840
I'm one with the... wait, what the fuck?

1850
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:51,500
Bro, what the...

1851
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:53,060
Bro, I'm bad at shooting drones!

1852
01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:54,460
Leave me alone!

1853
01:21:58,200 --> 01:21:59,320
Oh, I got it.

1854
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:03,120
Okay, I'm good at this.

1855
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:04,480
Guys, I got the drone.

1856
01:22:06,980 --> 01:22:07,420
Alright.

1857
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:11,860
Where is he?

1858
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:15,180
I'm one with the grass.

1859
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:19,760
I don't know where he is.

1860
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:22,160
That's what scares me.

1861
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:26,780
Where are they?

1862
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:28,960
Am I the only one left?

1863
01:22:35,610 --> 01:22:36,930
I think I'm the only one left.

1864
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:42,960
I'm the only one left.

1865
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:45,300
Oh no.

1866
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:47,100
Where's my teammates?

1867
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:49,120
Tell me where they are.

1868
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:52,600
Tell me where they are.

1869
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:54,200
Oh shit!

1870
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:55,680
Guys, you're supposed to tell me where they are!

1871
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:57,080
Not the explosion!

1872
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:57,720
It's supposed to be me!

1873
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:58,200
You fuckers!

1874
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:08,220
Bro, why are you exposing my position?

1875
01:23:16,470 --> 01:23:19,010
You're supposed to be helping me!

1876
01:23:22,390 --> 01:23:24,570
Where are they?

1877
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:34,570
He's over there.

1878
01:23:34,570 --> 01:23:34,990
He's over there.

1879
01:23:36,710 --> 01:23:37,510
I got him!

1880
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:43,000
That's five?

1881
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:44,980
Wait, there's more?

1882
01:23:52,430 --> 01:23:53,810
Where's the last guy?

1883
01:23:59,020 --> 01:23:59,420
Okay.

1884
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:02,420
Where's the last guy?

1885
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:04,980
No!

1886
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:05,840
Fuck off!

1887
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:12,140
Stop!

1888
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:12,640
AHHHHH!

1889
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:16,620
No!

1890
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:19,100
No, I got shot, I got shot, I got shot.

1891
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:25,920
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no.

1892
01:24:27,660 --> 01:24:28,660
Yeah, what the...

1893
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:31,160
The other drone!

1894
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:39,200
I even got two kills!

1895
01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:42,480
From the other drone!

1896
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:45,420
I got a drone kill!

1897
01:24:47,090 --> 01:24:49,100
Is that fair?!

1898
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:53,160
I got killed so hard!

1899
01:24:55,550 --> 01:24:56,840
Holy shit!

1900
01:24:57,490 --> 01:24:59,050
I got killed so...

1901
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:04,300
I even got two kills too!

1902
01:25:04,740 --> 01:25:06,180
That's bullshit!

1903
01:25:07,650 --> 01:25:09,800
Guess how the Terry Bulls have turned.

1904
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:14,600
Now I know, now I know why that guy was so mad.

1905
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:20,580
Now I know why the other guy was so annoyed with me.

1906
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:24,020
I know how he feels now.

1907
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:28,140
Okay, I'm in the open.

1908
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:28,880
This is not good.

1909
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:31,720
I need to find cover.

1910
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:32,720
Fast.

1911
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:35,040
No.

1912
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:36,520
I'm getting stuck.

1913
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:40,440
Oh god, this is cover.

1914
01:25:44,090 --> 01:25:44,910
Oh no.

1915
01:25:45,150 --> 01:25:46,230
Oh no.

1916
01:25:48,870 --> 01:25:49,430
Oh, no.

1917
01:25:49,430 --> 01:25:50,150
Okay, that's my teammate.

1918
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:53,190
I would try not to do Friendly Five.

1919
01:25:54,830 --> 01:25:55,630
Oh, no.

1920
01:25:55,770 --> 01:25:57,110
I'm getting better though!

1921
01:25:57,270 --> 01:25:57,910
I'm improving!

1922
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:02,690
Oh, at least I'm improving.

1923
01:26:02,930 --> 01:26:03,410
Chat.

1924
01:26:04,930 --> 01:26:06,450
I'm one with our bushes.

1925
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:13,460
Oh no, I don't feel safe.

1926
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:14,820
I don't feel safe.

1927
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:15,560
I need this tree.

1928
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:17,720
No, no, no, no, no.

1929
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:19,340
This tree isn't part of this.

1930
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:20,640
This tree is out.

1931
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:23,060
The tree is outside.

1932
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:25,260
Oh no.

1933
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:26,580
I see him.

1934
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:26,960
I see him.

1935
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:28,340
I tried to ping.

1936
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:29,680
I don't know why I tried to ping.

1937
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:35,360
I hear... No!

1938
01:26:40,210 --> 01:26:40,950
Did I get him?

1939
01:26:41,890 --> 01:26:42,450
I don't know.

1940
01:26:42,490 --> 01:26:42,930
Did I get him?

1941
01:26:44,230 --> 01:26:44,970
I think so.

1942
01:26:48,090 --> 01:26:51,630
Dragon, it's you and me.

1943
01:26:52,090 --> 01:26:52,950
No, no, no, no, no.

1944
01:26:56,170 --> 01:26:56,750
Oh no.

1945
01:26:57,210 --> 01:26:59,770
Dragon, I hope I die first so you have to clutch it.

1946
01:27:01,030 --> 01:27:01,730
Am I bleeding?

1947
01:27:01,730 --> 01:27:03,170
Woo!

1948
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:10,460
I'm so scared.

1949
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,440
I don't know if I can move out of this position, dragon.

1950
01:27:15,990 --> 01:27:16,990
No!

1951
01:27:17,890 --> 01:27:18,450
No!

1952
01:27:19,350 --> 01:27:22,310
I'm so god damn drawn!

1953
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:28,450
Oh my god!

1954
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:32,490
The fucking drawn faded me!

1955
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:35,050
I can't believe it!

1956
01:27:36,210 --> 01:27:40,160
I actually believe it.

1957
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:40,520
I can't believe it.

1958
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:40,520
I can't believe it.

1959
01:27:40,540 --> 01:27:40,720
I'm so fucking faded.

1960
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:43,560
I can't... Bro!

1961
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:46,780
How are you so smart?

1962
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:49,660
I got drawn so hard!

1963
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:53,760
Oh my god!

1964
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:55,100
Get drawn, nerd!

1965
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,640
I can't believe it.

1966
01:28:00,860 --> 01:28:02,180
I can't bel...

1967
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:07,140
I can't believe I got faded by the fucking drone!

1968
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:10,960
And then they destroyed my drone so fast.

1969
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:16,460
Hey bro!

1970
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:16,780
It's over.

1971
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:23,360
GG's guys Thought it was a 4 to 10 My God!

1972
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:25,760
I can't believe it.

1973
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:28,180
I got RP, though!

1974
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:31,260
I got rank points from it!

1975
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:34,380
I think I did pretty well.

1976
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:39,040
I was not bottom fag.

1977
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:40,940
Somebody did worse than me!

1978
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:42,240
I can't believe this game.

1979
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:43,320
Somebody did worse to me.

1980
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:44,060
I saw it.

1981
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:46,800
I saw it, guys.

1982
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:53,700
Wait, how do I leave?

1983
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:55,480
How the fuck do I...

1984
01:28:57,620 --> 01:28:59,480
Guys, the game bugged out, guys.

1985
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:02,900
I can't even leave this live.

1986
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:06,920
Holy shit.

1987
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:10,740
It like bugged out so I can't leave the live.

1988
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:13,600
Oh, no!

1989
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:15,580
No.

1990
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:16,500
Oh, God.

1991
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,220
Okay, I have to turn...

1992
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:20,060
Oh, my God.

1993
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:21,580
It like auto plays.

1994
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:23,580
That shit auto plays.

1995
01:29:23,740 --> 01:29:25,720
I'm the host but it won't...

1996
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:27,920
It won't even...

1997
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:29,840
I can't leave.

1998
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:31,560
I actually can't leave.

1999
01:29:31,780 --> 01:29:32,740
I'm stuck here.

2000
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:34,540
I'm actually stuck here.

2001
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:41,900
I'm stuck forever.

2002
01:29:43,540 --> 01:29:46,020
We can't even start the lobby.

2003
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:50,520
We have to reset the game.

2004
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:52,680
I'm actually... I can't even like...

2005
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:55,460
I can't even like start the lobby.

2006
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,080
I actually have to reset.

2007
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:58,480
Alright.

2008
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:00,040
Okay.

2009
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:02,180
There was like one of the maps I really want to play too.

2010
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:03,320
There was another map I want to play.

2011
01:30:03,740 --> 01:30:05,080
It was like the... what was it?

2012
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:08,460
It was like tactical training shit with all the wood stuff.

2013
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:10,080
Okay.

2014
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:13,200
Alright, let's make sure I don't play this.

2015
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:14,840
And then...

2016
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:15,940
Lobby.

2017
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:16,480
Okay.

2018
01:30:17,740 --> 01:30:18,300
Okay.

2019
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:19,400
Start match.

2020
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:21,660
Host map.

2021
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:22,280
Okay.

2022
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:23,640
Alright.

2023
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:25,600
I really want to try...

2024
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:27,980
Alright, should we do body planting or deathmatch, guys?

2025
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,080
Team deathmatch or body plant?

2026
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:32,780
Team deathmatch or body plant?

2027
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:33,920
What should we do?

2028
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:34,860
Or body bomb?

2029
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:36,520
What should we do?

2030
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,300
I went to the airsoft house.

2031
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:41,560
Wait.

2032
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:42,580
Hahaha.

2033
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:46,980
Body or deathmatch?

2034
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:49,340
Deathmatch for the chaos team.

2035
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:50,560
Okay.

2036
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:51,540
We'll do...

2037
01:30:52,340 --> 01:30:55,400
Oh my gosh, the abandoned hospital looks so fun too.

2038
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:56,800
We'll do house.

2039
01:30:56,900 --> 01:30:58,900
We'll do airsoft house first.

2040
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:03,000
And then we'll try the abandoned hospital and the planting one.

2041
01:31:03,220 --> 01:31:04,580
Actually, oh my gosh.

2042
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:05,140
I don't know.

2043
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:06,400
Which is better, guys?

2044
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:08,720
Should team deathmatch...

2045
01:31:09,820 --> 01:31:10,920
Should team deathmatch...

2046
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:12,380
be on the house?

2047
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:13,900
Airsoft house or the hospital?

2048
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:16,360
What should we do?

2049
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:18,900
Hospital or airsoft house?

2050
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:19,800
For team deathmatch.

2051
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:20,280
Airsoft?

2052
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:22,620
Okay.

2053
01:31:22,940 --> 01:31:23,800
Airsoft house.

2054
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:24,100
Okay.

2055
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:25,080
We'll try.

2056
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:27,540
This shit is intense.

2057
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:34,810
Alright, here we go.

2058
01:31:35,170 --> 01:31:35,610
Vroom.

2059
01:31:37,870 --> 01:31:38,430
Vroom.

2060
01:31:41,870 --> 01:31:42,530
Let's go!

2061
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:45,090
To the... Let's jump to the airsoft...

2062
01:31:45,290 --> 01:31:46,070
Me and my homies.

2063
01:31:46,830 --> 01:31:48,690
Parachuting to the airsoft house.

2064
01:31:51,790 --> 01:31:53,230
Me and my homies.

2065
01:31:53,410 --> 01:31:54,590
Parachuting over there.

2066
01:31:55,770 --> 01:31:56,390
Nice.

2067
01:31:56,430 --> 01:31:56,650
Okay.

2068
01:32:07,550 --> 01:32:08,550
Alright, here we go.

2069
01:32:08,870 --> 01:32:10,410
Just like in real life.

2070
01:32:11,330 --> 01:32:12,470
Just like...

2071
01:32:12,470 --> 01:32:13,070
Ooh.

2072
01:32:13,650 --> 01:32:15,750
Oh my god, this shit is...

2073
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:17,470
Oh, this shit is intense.

2074
01:32:17,830 --> 01:32:19,910
Because there's like fake people too.

2075
01:32:20,470 --> 01:32:21,870
Who is here?

2076
01:32:22,530 --> 01:32:23,730
What the fuck?

2077
01:32:24,930 --> 01:32:26,050
Is that person?

2078
01:32:26,170 --> 01:32:27,590
No, that's not.

2079
01:32:27,690 --> 01:32:28,290
That's so...

2080
01:32:28,290 --> 01:32:28,870
Okay, that's scary.

2081
01:32:29,590 --> 01:32:30,310
What?

2082
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:37,260
What?

2083
01:32:39,940 --> 01:32:41,060
What do you mean?

2084
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:44,640
No.

2085
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:48,960
You shot your own teammate, you idiot.

2086
01:32:49,340 --> 01:32:50,380
But we won.

2087
01:32:53,780 --> 01:32:55,220
You fucking...

2088
01:32:58,400 --> 01:32:59,820
Why'd you turn...

2089
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:01,160
Because I couldn't see.

2090
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:03,320
What do you mean?

2091
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:06,900
Alan fucking shot me!

2092
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:10,820
What do you mean?

2093
01:33:11,420 --> 01:33:12,140
What do you mean?

2094
01:33:12,140 --> 01:33:13,460
Oh, this shit is intense though.

2095
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:14,340
Jesus Christ.

2096
01:33:14,780 --> 01:33:16,600
That shit scares me.

2097
01:33:17,220 --> 01:33:17,520
That shit scares me.

2098
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:21,800
That person?

2099
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:22,600
That person?

2100
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:25,560
Wait, the drone...

2101
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:27,560
The drone is like using its lights.

2102
01:33:35,950 --> 01:33:37,310
Somebody there.

2103
01:33:43,450 --> 01:33:44,090
No!

2104
01:33:44,390 --> 01:33:45,030
No!

2105
01:33:45,570 --> 01:33:49,000
Double tap.

2106
01:33:53,020 --> 01:33:53,660
Oh.

2107
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:55,280
Oh.

2108
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:56,720
Oh, this is scary.

2109
01:33:57,380 --> 01:33:58,300
Oh, please.

2110
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:02,800
Oh.

2111
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:04,720
This is intense.

2112
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:12,540
Oh god.

2113
01:34:15,630 --> 01:34:16,690
Oh god.

2114
01:34:17,310 --> 01:34:19,070
Holy shit, this is intense.

2115
01:34:19,690 --> 01:34:21,210
I hear him, he's over there.

2116
01:34:23,830 --> 01:34:25,250
Drones, find him!

2117
01:34:28,660 --> 01:34:30,020
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2118
01:34:30,740 --> 01:34:33,180
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2119
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:34,040
He's to my left.

2120
01:34:34,140 --> 01:34:34,860
I hear him.

2121
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:37,120
Oh, I hear him.

2122
01:34:47,420 --> 01:34:48,620
God, that scared me.

2123
01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:51,200
Where is he?

2124
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:52,480
Oh.

2125
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:02,220
You fucker!

2126
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:03,640
You fucker!

2127
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:05,540
Okay.

2128
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:08,380
Okay, let's hope that guy didn't find me.

2129
01:35:09,140 --> 01:35:11,570
Okay, let's hope that guy didn't find me.

2130
01:35:12,370 --> 01:35:13,550
Oh my god.

2131
01:35:13,850 --> 01:35:16,190
It's whoever finds each other first.

2132
01:35:20,290 --> 01:35:21,710
Oh my god.

2133
01:35:21,730 --> 01:35:24,590
Wait, this is much more intense than the forest, guys.

2134
01:35:24,970 --> 01:35:28,890
This is so much more intense than the forest, chat.

2135
01:35:38,510 --> 01:35:39,670
I hear him.

2136
01:35:41,310 --> 01:35:42,970
It's like close by.

2137
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:48,980
Oh my god.

2138
01:35:48,980 --> 01:35:49,100
Oh my god.

2139
01:35:49,780 --> 01:35:50,720
You saw him?

2140
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:51,000
Where?

2141
01:35:59,930 --> 01:36:00,730
Oh no.

2142
01:36:07,740 --> 01:36:08,140
Where?

2143
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:10,700
I saw him too.

2144
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:13,260
Wait, I just saw him.

2145
01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:13,980
Did you guys see him?

2146
01:36:14,220 --> 01:36:15,480
I saw him right there.

2147
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,040
To your left, I think the other...

2148
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:20,000
Guys, no, don't say that.

2149
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:20,960
Don't do this to me.

2150
01:36:22,660 --> 01:36:23,420
He was above.

2151
01:36:23,580 --> 01:36:24,600
He was above the house.

2152
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:27,860
Oh my god.

2153
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:35,680
Oh my god.

2154
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:36,700
Why?

2155
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:47,420
This is so tense!

2156
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:02,160
Oh my god.

2157
01:37:13,450 --> 01:37:13,990
Okay.

2158
01:37:27,380 --> 01:37:28,420
I hate this.

2159
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:30,300
Oh my god, I'm so tensed up.

2160
01:37:38,420 --> 01:37:39,480
There's fall damage.

2161
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:40,440
No.

2162
01:37:47,550 --> 01:37:48,170
It's so...

2163
01:37:48,190 --> 01:37:49,490
There's fall damage.

2164
01:37:51,010 --> 01:37:52,650
This is so

2165
01:38:00,350 --> 01:38:00,970
life.

2166
01:38:01,450 --> 01:38:02,710
It's so...

2167
01:38:06,890 --> 01:38:08,430
Oh my god.

2168
01:38:08,450 --> 01:38:12,070
It's so real that there's fall damage.

2169
01:38:14,650 --> 01:38:16,250
Holy shit.

2170
01:38:16,850 --> 01:38:18,590
What is this?

2171
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:19,930
Bullshit.

2172
01:38:20,450 --> 01:38:22,630
What the fuck is this?

2173
01:38:22,670 --> 01:38:23,750
Bullshit.

2174
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:34,080
I'm still crying about the fall damage.

2175
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:35,940
No!

2176
01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:37,280
I crashed!

2177
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:39,260
How did I crash?

2178
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:40,720
What?

2179
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:47,060
I flew one centimeter and I spiraled.

2180
01:38:47,220 --> 01:38:47,880
How?

2181
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:50,460
No.

2182
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:52,660
It's all falling apart.

2183
01:38:53,340 --> 01:38:55,160
It's all falling apart.

2184
01:39:00,510 --> 01:39:02,570
Oh my god.

2185
01:39:02,630 --> 01:39:04,870
Everything is falling apart.

2186
01:39:04,870 --> 01:39:05,490
Chat.

2187
01:39:10,450 --> 01:39:12,410
Everything is falling apart.

2188
01:39:16,450 --> 01:39:17,650
Holy shit.

2189
01:39:17,950 --> 01:39:19,410
That shit is brutal.

2190
01:39:19,850 --> 01:39:21,690
That shit is actually brutal.

2191
01:39:28,150 --> 01:39:29,610
I see him.

2192
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:39,760
No!

2193
01:39:40,020 --> 01:39:41,640
I shot the pillar!

2194
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:44,040
Holy shit.

2195
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:45,880
Spark flew out of there.

2196
01:39:46,160 --> 01:39:47,360
I was the last one?

2197
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:48,240
Guys.

2198
01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:51,980
2, 4, 5, 2, 4...

2199
01:39:51,980 --> 01:39:52,320
Damn it.

2200
01:39:52,340 --> 01:39:53,040
I can't swap teams.

2201
01:39:56,920 --> 01:39:58,760
God fucking damn it.

2202
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:01,940
I can't do what I wanted to do.

2203
01:40:03,780 --> 01:40:05,160
The pillar protects.

2204
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:05,380
The pillar protects.

2205
01:40:05,660 --> 01:40:09,000
The pillar protects.

2206
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:09,920
No!

2207
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:10,840
No!

2208
01:40:10,940 --> 01:40:11,700
He's so good!

2209
01:40:12,100 --> 01:40:13,460
He's so good!

2210
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,040
It's okay.

2211
01:40:15,220 --> 01:40:16,380
My job.

2212
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:18,760
Oh shit.

2213
01:40:19,060 --> 01:40:19,580
Oh!

2214
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:20,860
Oh!

2215
01:40:21,540 --> 01:40:24,840
Oh, he's over here!

2216
01:40:25,580 --> 01:40:27,080
He's over here!

2217
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:29,160
He's over here!

2218
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:29,420
No!

2219
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:30,560
No!

2220
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:30,620
Hahaha!

2221
01:40:34,150 --> 01:40:34,650
Hahaha!

2222
01:40:36,090 --> 01:40:36,590
Hahaha!

2223
01:40:39,510 --> 01:40:40,010
Nice.

2224
01:40:40,230 --> 01:40:40,630
It's okay.

2225
01:40:40,730 --> 01:40:42,910
I got...I distracted two people.

2226
01:40:43,210 --> 01:40:43,390
Hahaha!

2227
01:40:43,990 --> 01:40:44,690
That's okay.

2228
01:40:44,810 --> 01:40:45,870
I got...oh my god.

2229
01:40:45,890 --> 01:40:46,690
Is that my body?

2230
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:47,250
Over there?

2231
01:40:48,770 --> 01:40:50,270
I got two assists, guys.

2232
01:40:50,710 --> 01:40:51,930
That's all that matters.

2233
01:40:52,050 --> 01:40:52,910
I contributed.

2234
01:40:54,710 --> 01:40:55,710
I contributed.

2235
01:40:56,330 --> 01:40:56,830
Hahaha!

2236
01:40:57,970 --> 01:40:59,390
Bro, what the fuck?

2237
01:40:59,390 --> 01:41:00,690
That's my dead body.

2238
01:41:00,950 --> 01:41:01,710
That's fucked up.

2239
01:41:03,190 --> 01:41:04,250
Holy shit.

2240
01:41:04,330 --> 01:41:06,430
This map is actually so intense though.

2241
01:41:07,130 --> 01:41:10,110
We've had enough of your shenanigans, Doki.

2242
01:41:10,410 --> 01:41:12,270
We had enough.

2243
01:41:13,930 --> 01:41:15,650
Why do you be a contributor so little?

2244
01:41:16,770 --> 01:41:17,970
I helped.

2245
01:41:18,870 --> 01:41:21,190
At least I got one kill.

2246
01:41:21,690 --> 01:41:26,090
At least I got one kill, guys.

2247
01:41:27,010 --> 01:41:28,310
That's all that matters.

2248
01:41:29,070 --> 01:41:30,150
The moral support.

2249
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:35,200
The blur on the left?

2250
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:37,000
Oh wait, that's just so we don't dox people.

2251
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:41,440
You know, because this is... we're basically... you know how like we're controlling...

2252
01:41:41,980 --> 01:41:42,500
Uh...

2253
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:45,360
What the fuck happened to that drone?

2254
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:48,240
So like we're actually controlling like...

2255
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:49,100
Uh...

2256
01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:54,460
We're like implants in like military men and we're like controlling them right now.

2257
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,420
Oh my god, you're bleeding!

2258
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:56,600
Medic!

2259
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:00,520
This is real life.

2260
01:42:00,620 --> 01:42:01,640
This is not a simulation.

2261
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:06,680
So we gotta... we gotta make sure... we gotta make sure we don't accidentally dox them.

2262
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:07,940
Bro, you're gonna bleed out!

2263
01:42:08,180 --> 01:42:10,840
Look at the trail of blood behind you!

2264
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:15,260
Dude, you're gonna bleed out before you get to anybody!

2265
01:42:16,460 --> 01:42:21,800
Like, fucking rip off your shirt and tie it like... and soak up that blood!

2266
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,720
Bro, look at your trail of blood.

2267
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:27,620
Bro is fucking...

2268
01:42:28,580 --> 01:42:29,620
leaking a trail.

2269
01:42:30,260 --> 01:42:31,780
Holy shit!

2270
01:42:32,200 --> 01:42:35,380
He's gonna bleed out before like anybody shoots him.

2271
01:42:37,460 --> 01:42:38,460
I'm mortal.

2272
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:41,880
But they're just gonna follow this trail of blood.

2273
01:42:43,300 --> 01:42:46,960
He's leaving a little treasure hunt for... is he gonna die?

2274
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:49,600
Oh, I thought he was just gonna start passing out.

2275
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:51,320
He almost shot Alan!

2276
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:58,660
It's like, you know like those children mazes?

2277
01:42:58,680 --> 01:43:00,760
Those coloring books in like children mazes?

2278
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,060
This is like his coloring book right now.

2279
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:05,380
He's trying to find the exit chat...

2280
01:43:06,160 --> 01:43:08,780
He's trying to find the exit.

2281
01:43:09,820 --> 01:43:10,380
Wait...

2282
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:17,080
Almost friendly fire!

2283
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:18,540
What are you doing?

2284
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:20,820
Wait, where are you...

2285
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:21,680
Bro, he...

2286
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:22,120
AHH!

2287
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:28,240
What are you... what are you doing?

2288
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:29,140
What did I want?

2289
01:43:32,300 --> 01:43:35,760
He got shot in front of him and he looked behind.

2290
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:37,840
No!

2291
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:43,820
Bro is playing turf war.

2292
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:46,040
Why he turned around?

2293
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:48,640
Why he turned around?

2294
01:43:52,660 --> 01:43:55,400
To be fair, he lost a lot of blood.

2295
01:43:55,820 --> 01:43:57,040
You're right, you're right guys.

2296
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:58,200
You're right.

2297
01:43:58,260 --> 01:43:58,980
That is fair.

2298
01:43:58,980 --> 01:44:01,180
He did lose a lot of blood.

2299
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:02,820
He did not know where he was going.

2300
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:06,160
He was losing a lot of blood there.

2301
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:07,720
Jesus.

2302
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:11,020
That's a lot of gunshots.

2303
01:44:20,430 --> 01:44:21,490
Shadow don't die!

2304
01:44:21,570 --> 01:44:22,170
I'm watching you!

2305
01:44:25,580 --> 01:44:26,340
Wait, what?

2306
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:27,700
He got shot.

2307
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:28,560
But from where?

2308
01:44:31,540 --> 01:44:32,420
Did I shoot you?

2309
01:44:35,820 --> 01:44:36,860
Oh no, I'm bleeding.

2310
01:44:37,180 --> 01:44:37,980
Oh no.

2311
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:38,720
Guys.

2312
01:44:39,420 --> 01:44:40,180
My trail of blood.

2313
01:44:41,340 --> 01:44:43,040
Not looking too good for me.

2314
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:45,080
It's not looking too good for Doki.

2315
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:51,180
Is that the good guy flashlight or the bad guy flashlight?

2316
01:44:51,180 --> 01:44:52,680
It's time to find out.

2317
01:44:53,940 --> 01:44:54,480
No!

2318
01:44:58,170 --> 01:44:59,680
I'm the Picasso now.

2319
01:45:03,860 --> 01:45:04,980
Wait, I was the last?

2320
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:06,240
Guys, we're not very good.

2321
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:08,300
I'm gonna say it guys.

2322
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:10,340
Our teammate looks so good.

2323
01:45:10,540 --> 01:45:11,060
Chat.

2324
01:45:13,120 --> 01:45:15,200
Our team is struggling right now.

2325
01:45:21,100 --> 01:45:21,740
Oh.

2326
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:23,520
I just saw him die.

2327
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:27,640
Bro, he's like shooting me through walls.

2328
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:33,800
What the f- I'm sprinkling blood!

2329
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:36,280
I'm coughing blood right now!

2330
01:45:43,210 --> 01:45:43,610
Where?

2331
01:45:46,390 --> 01:45:47,190
Oh shit.

2332
01:45:47,310 --> 01:45:48,550
I hope- Okay guys, I got him.

2333
01:45:48,610 --> 01:45:49,570
It's fine, I killed him.

2334
01:45:52,370 --> 01:45:53,850
Bro, where's the Medic?

2335
01:45:54,730 --> 01:45:56,550
Guys, I think they're better than us.

2336
01:45:56,610 --> 01:45:56,790
Guys.

2337
01:45:57,110 --> 01:45:58,230
I have a feeling.

2338
01:45:58,510 --> 01:46:00,270
Maybe it's high ground advantage, chat.

2339
01:46:00,530 --> 01:46:02,490
Maybe it's just high ground advantage, you know?

2340
01:46:02,750 --> 01:46:04,770
Maybe we're not bad, they just have high ground.

2341
01:46:08,710 --> 01:46:09,450
Like we all have high ground.

2342
01:46:09,450 --> 01:46:11,390
Y'all know high ground advantage is strong.

2343
01:46:11,970 --> 01:46:12,890
It's not...

2344
01:46:12,890 --> 01:46:13,350
Shit.

2345
01:46:15,530 --> 01:46:16,630
Holy shit.

2346
01:46:18,890 --> 01:46:19,470
That was scary.

2347
01:46:20,890 --> 01:46:21,450
What

2348
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:27,260
do you mean, oh?

2349
01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:28,900
What do you mean, oh?

2350
01:46:31,100 --> 01:46:32,840
What do you mean by oh?

2351
01:46:49,060 --> 01:46:50,180
Guys, I'm scared.

2352
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:51,940
What?

2353
01:46:52,060 --> 01:46:53,120
How did he know?

2354
01:46:57,180 --> 01:46:59,300
Wait, he was inside too?

2355
01:47:00,860 --> 01:47:02,160
Oh my god, he's over here.

2356
01:47:02,780 --> 01:47:03,780
He's in the shadows.

2357
01:47:08,740 --> 01:47:09,780
Oh wait,

2358
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:15,580
we all died.

2359
01:47:15,740 --> 01:47:16,060
Okay.

2360
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:17,520
It didn't matter.

2361
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:22,200
Okay.

2362
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:26,580
Okay, there we go.

2363
01:47:30,100 --> 01:47:31,300
I'm gonna do something great.

2364
01:47:59,620 --> 01:48:01,140
Oh wait, that's you.

2365
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,100
Oh, he's over here in the corner.

2366
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:09,940
He's on the second floor.

2367
01:48:11,190 --> 01:48:13,000
He's out running down the stairs.

2368
01:48:28,270 --> 01:48:29,510
He's not...

2369
01:48:29,510 --> 01:48:31,530
Oh my god.

2370
01:48:32,610 --> 01:48:34,090
He's off the...

2371
01:48:34,090 --> 01:48:35,330
He's mad.

2372
01:48:41,420 --> 01:48:42,690
I think he's...

2373
01:48:42,690 --> 01:48:44,090
He didn't like it.

2374
01:48:44,230 --> 01:48:46,830
The world's strongest drone.

2375
01:48:49,010 --> 01:48:49,690
Dang.

2376
01:48:49,970 --> 01:48:51,770
I can't believe it.

2377
01:48:51,850 --> 01:48:54,250
Got down in the boo drone.

2378
01:48:54,650 --> 01:48:56,850
The fucking boo drone.

2379
01:48:59,510 --> 01:49:01,170
It's the only way to win.

2380
01:49:01,570 --> 01:49:03,250
See, we're one to eight.

2381
01:49:03,450 --> 01:49:05,190
What do you want us to do?

2382
01:49:07,510 --> 01:49:08,270
He's mad.

2383
01:49:09,010 --> 01:49:09,870
He's mad.

2384
01:49:10,590 --> 01:49:12,310
Guys, we're one to eight.

2385
01:49:12,470 --> 01:49:13,250
We gotta...

2386
01:49:13,250 --> 01:49:14,290
We gotta...

2387
01:49:14,290 --> 01:49:15,350
Do what we can.

2388
01:49:15,690 --> 01:49:17,090
To like, get something.

2389
01:49:21,270 --> 01:49:22,590
We're gonna hit down the stairs.

2390
01:49:22,750 --> 01:49:24,230
I've had enough of being upstairs.

2391
01:49:26,590 --> 01:49:28,130
Oh my god.

2392
01:49:30,970 --> 01:49:32,590
Okay, we'll go back upstairs.

2393
01:49:40,860 --> 01:49:41,780
Did I sh...

2394
01:49:41,780 --> 01:49:42,460
Did I get him?

2395
01:49:47,340 --> 01:49:48,420
Oh, I think I got him.

2396
01:49:48,940 --> 01:49:49,460
Yeah!

2397
01:49:57,110 --> 01:49:58,650
Is that a guy over there?

2398
01:50:00,450 --> 01:50:01,250
I got him.

2399
01:50:01,250 --> 01:50:02,550
I did it!

2400
01:50:08,700 --> 01:50:10,560
Guys, I'm getting better!

2401
01:50:11,140 --> 01:50:12,580
I got three kills!

2402
01:50:13,140 --> 01:50:15,340
What the fuck have you guys been doing?

2403
01:50:18,980 --> 01:50:19,700
Woo!

2404
01:50:20,240 --> 01:50:22,240
One shot, one kill.

2405
01:50:27,330 --> 01:50:28,050
Okay.

2406
01:50:29,770 --> 01:50:31,810
I feel safer over here.

2407
01:50:32,770 --> 01:50:33,890
Guns are loud.

2408
01:50:36,930 --> 01:50:38,490
Guns are so loud.

2409
01:50:39,750 --> 01:50:40,570
Who are they shooting?

2410
01:50:43,030 --> 01:50:45,390
Who the fuck are they trying to shoot?

2411
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:51,940
There's only two of us left.

2412
01:50:52,700 --> 01:50:53,620
Three of us.

2413
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:56,800
I'm not peeking.

2414
01:50:58,220 --> 01:50:59,120
What if I...

2415
01:50:59,980 --> 01:51:01,280
Okay, I'm not gonna risk it again.

2416
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:02,720
I was gonna say, what if I just drop down?

2417
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:06,620
Then like, I remember what happened when I just dropped down.

2418
01:51:07,300 --> 01:51:07,740
Wait.

2419
01:51:10,180 --> 01:51:10,700
Wait.

2420
01:51:10,700 --> 01:51:11,880
There's someone over there.

2421
01:51:12,260 --> 01:51:12,780
Oh.

2422
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:13,640
There is.

2423
01:51:21,530 --> 01:51:22,050
No.

2424
01:51:22,170 --> 01:51:22,490
No!

2425
01:51:23,770 --> 01:51:24,290
No!

2426
01:51:25,690 --> 01:51:27,150
I was the last one!

2427
01:51:27,510 --> 01:51:28,310
Wait, I got two...

2428
01:51:28,310 --> 01:51:29,150
I got another kill!

2429
01:51:29,430 --> 01:51:30,090
Okay, I got a kill.

2430
01:51:30,410 --> 01:51:32,130
Guys, I got another kill.

2431
01:51:33,350 --> 01:51:35,330
Guys, it's the last game, guys.

2432
01:51:35,590 --> 01:51:36,870
It's the last game.

2433
01:51:40,570 --> 01:51:41,690
Oh my god.

2434
01:51:42,170 --> 01:51:43,630
I got another kill though.

2435
01:51:43,810 --> 01:51:44,350
I'm gaming.

2436
01:51:44,890 --> 01:51:46,250
I'm gonna head downstairs.

2437
01:51:46,690 --> 01:51:47,590
I think...

2438
01:51:52,470 --> 01:51:53,630
I'm gonna head downstairs.

2439
01:51:54,290 --> 01:51:58,030
Whatever gun I had that got me those four kills, that was clutch.

2440
01:51:58,370 --> 01:51:59,770
That was my favorite gun.

2441
01:51:59,970 --> 01:52:00,690
Not gonna lie.

2442
01:52:07,860 --> 01:52:09,280
Whichever gun that was.

2443
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:20,160
Nevermind.

2444
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:21,940
Oh!

2445
01:52:22,140 --> 01:52:23,040
He's over here!

2446
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:25,360
Bottom floor!

2447
01:52:25,580 --> 01:52:26,680
On the left!

2448
01:52:26,940 --> 01:52:27,840
Or my right.

2449
01:52:32,640 --> 01:52:33,280
Okay.

2450
01:52:33,580 --> 01:52:34,100
Wait.

2451
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:35,440
Bro.

2452
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:37,420
All the...

2453
01:52:37,420 --> 01:52:39,520
Guys, the enemy is on the other side.

2454
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:47,140
Woo!

2455
01:52:52,540 --> 01:52:53,260
Second floor!

2456
01:52:57,920 --> 01:52:59,120
Second floor!

2457
01:53:06,550 --> 01:53:08,470
Guys, they're on the other side.

2458
01:53:16,470 --> 01:53:18,270
They're on the other side.

2459
01:53:18,370 --> 01:53:19,370
Second floor!

2460
01:53:19,370 --> 01:53:20,210
Floor!

2461
01:53:23,690 --> 01:53:24,710
Second floor!

2462
01:53:28,830 --> 01:53:29,850
Oh no!

2463
01:53:30,130 --> 01:53:31,770
You're the last one!

2464
01:53:32,370 --> 01:53:33,310
Clutch your kick!

2465
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:50,600
No, he's on the third floor.

2466
01:53:50,940 --> 01:53:51,920
He's... oh he's dead.

2467
01:53:53,060 --> 01:53:54,980
Woah, you did it!

2468
01:53:56,900 --> 01:54:04,160
Bro, the other enemy drone was giving him intel and then he just dies.

2469
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:11,600
He actually clutched it!

2470
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:14,320
Oh my god, he clutched it!

2471
01:54:16,220 --> 01:54:17,580
That's crazy!

2472
01:54:17,580 --> 01:54:19,520
I did not expect that.

2473
01:54:19,820 --> 01:54:21,900
I did not expect the clutch.

2474
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:26,840
He did clutch your kick, guys!

2475
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:27,700
He did it!

2476
01:54:29,140 --> 01:54:32,360
We were like, clutch your kick and he actually clutched.

2477
01:54:38,330 --> 01:54:39,590
Where are these shots?

2478
01:54:49,690 --> 01:54:51,170
That's not a real person.

2479
01:54:52,070 --> 01:54:53,590
That's not a real person.

2480
01:54:54,310 --> 01:54:54,830
No!

2481
01:54:56,490 --> 01:54:57,230
I'm bleeding.

2482
01:54:58,150 --> 01:54:59,490
Guys, oh no.

2483
01:54:59,910 --> 01:55:01,690
My trail of blood remembers me.

2484
01:55:01,690 --> 01:55:01,790
I'm bleeding.

2485
01:55:01,790 --> 01:55:01,930
My trail of blood remembers me.

2486
01:55:04,290 --> 01:55:05,390
Oh no.

2487
01:55:07,350 --> 01:55:08,450
Oh, he's second floor.

2488
01:55:09,890 --> 01:55:11,930
Guys, I'm bleeding so much.

2489
01:55:12,570 --> 01:55:14,550
Guys, is this the enemy drone?

2490
01:55:14,770 --> 01:55:15,430
Oh, we did it!

2491
01:55:15,470 --> 01:55:15,830
We won!

2492
01:55:16,150 --> 01:55:16,710
Yeah!

2493
01:55:19,850 --> 01:55:20,970
Holy shit.

2494
01:55:22,870 --> 01:55:23,810
We did it.

2495
01:55:24,590 --> 01:55:26,350
We did it.

2496
01:55:26,670 --> 01:55:27,230
Alright.

2497
01:55:28,410 --> 01:55:28,970
Nice.

2498
01:55:30,130 --> 01:55:30,690
Okay.

2499
01:55:31,930 --> 01:55:32,590
I'm gonna press shift tab.

2500
01:55:32,790 --> 01:55:34,710
So you saw my mic settings.

2501
01:55:38,670 --> 01:55:39,990
Oh my god.

2502
01:55:40,030 --> 01:55:41,890
They won't expect that.

2503
01:55:41,970 --> 01:55:42,850
Guys, look!

2504
01:55:42,990 --> 01:55:45,050
I'm actually doing...

2505
01:55:53,730 --> 01:55:55,170
He's over here.

2506
01:55:55,430 --> 01:55:55,610
Woo!

2507
01:55:57,490 --> 01:55:58,150
Woo!

2508
01:56:00,140 --> 01:56:02,860
You can't hear the sounds of the footsteps.

2509
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:03,460
Woo!

2510
01:56:10,870 --> 01:56:12,590
I can't believe it.

2511
01:56:12,770 --> 01:56:13,810
I can't.

2512
01:56:13,810 --> 01:56:15,990
I just wanted to look at my soun...

2513
01:56:16,570 --> 01:56:18,830
I just wanted to look at my sound settings!

2514
01:56:22,170 --> 01:56:22,690
Noooo!

2515
01:56:24,530 --> 01:56:27,530
I just wanted to look at my sound.

2516
01:56:27,630 --> 01:56:29,890
I just wanted to look at my, like,

2517
01:56:35,850 --> 01:56:39,450
That's all I'm going to say.

2518
01:56:40,650 --> 01:56:42,110
That's all I'm gonna say.

2519
01:56:42,650 --> 01:56:44,230
I did pretty well.

2520
01:56:44,370 --> 01:56:46,250
Okay, I want to do a body bomb.

2521
01:56:46,690 --> 01:56:48,610
Okay, I feel like Abandoned Hospital...

2522
01:56:48,610 --> 01:56:50,630
I think like this is too much camping.

2523
01:56:50,870 --> 01:56:53,310
I think this is too much camping.

2524
01:56:54,730 --> 01:56:56,550
It's not as fun because you're camping.

2525
01:56:56,650 --> 01:56:58,950
So I think like Team Deathmatch is actually pretty fun.

2526
01:57:01,430 --> 01:57:02,590
Yeah, improved a lot.

2527
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:08,300
I think I improved a lot.

2528
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:09,620
All right.

2529
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:11,580
Time to go to the Abandoned Hospital!

2530
01:57:11,700 --> 01:57:12,220
Let's go!

2531
01:57:21,560 --> 01:57:22,520
Holy shit!

2532
01:57:23,580 --> 01:57:26,120
Wait, this is... guys, this is pretty spooky.

2533
01:57:26,920 --> 01:57:28,480
This is pretty spooky guys.

2534
01:57:28,720 --> 01:57:30,520
Wait, they have all the good players!

2535
01:57:31,960 --> 01:57:33,340
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

2536
01:57:33,820 --> 01:57:34,880
Before it's too late.

2537
01:57:36,580 --> 01:57:37,060
NOOOOOO!

2538
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:44,040
Nooooo!

2539
01:57:44,360 --> 01:57:44,840
Nooooo!

2540
01:57:46,120 --> 01:57:46,600
Nooooo!

2541
01:57:48,260 --> 01:57:51,240
All the good players are on the enemy team!

2542
01:57:51,640 --> 01:57:53,400
This is not fair!

2543
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:55,500
Wait, this is so spooky.

2544
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:56,760
Holy shit.

2545
01:57:56,860 --> 01:57:57,840
This one's intense.

2546
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:01,760
This one's pretty intense, not gonna lie.

2547
01:58:05,250 --> 01:58:05,990
It's over there.

2548
01:58:06,570 --> 01:58:08,450
You go first, Shadow.

2549
01:58:09,150 --> 01:58:10,210
You go first, Shadow.

2550
01:58:10,470 --> 01:58:11,530
You'll be too busy shooting.

2551
01:58:13,430 --> 01:58:14,950
Jesus Christ, what do I have?

2552
01:58:15,010 --> 01:58:15,930
A fucking deagle?

2553
01:58:18,030 --> 01:58:19,550
That's so loud!

2554
01:58:20,730 --> 01:58:21,290
Ho

2555
01:58:26,210 --> 01:58:26,610
ho ho!

2556
01:58:27,410 --> 01:58:28,750
Jesus Christ!

2557
01:58:28,890 --> 01:58:31,330
That gun was so fucking loud!

2558
01:58:34,350 --> 01:58:35,410
Wait, where is he?

2559
01:58:36,150 --> 01:58:38,710
Bro, this is so... this is... this is intense.

2560
01:58:41,270 --> 01:58:43,270
I was like... bom bom!

2561
01:58:43,590 --> 01:58:45,670
I was like, what the fuck?!

2562
01:58:46,270 --> 01:58:46,830
AAH!

2563
01:58:47,730 --> 01:58:49,790
Guys, I hit my head again.

2564
01:58:49,970 --> 01:58:50,730
I hit..

2565
01:58:51,430 --> 01:58:53,530
We're taking fun of 10 gifted ships!

2566
01:58:53,750 --> 01:58:54,070
Thank you!

2567
01:58:56,230 --> 01:58:59,990
Guys, I can't believe guns are loud in real life.

2568
01:59:03,250 --> 01:59:05,190
You're like the only one left, guys.

2569
01:59:07,210 --> 01:59:09,410
Guns in Dora are really loud.

2570
01:59:14,700 --> 01:59:15,680
Oh my god.

2571
01:59:16,220 --> 01:59:17,060
It's crazy.

2572
01:59:21,690 --> 01:59:22,630
No way.

2573
01:59:23,770 --> 01:59:24,890
This realism...

2574
01:59:24,890 --> 01:59:26,890
Holy shit!

2575
01:59:28,050 --> 01:59:29,730
Holy fuck!

2576
01:59:30,510 --> 01:59:33,910
Guys, this realism shooter is so realistic.

2577
01:59:34,390 --> 01:59:35,470
Who would've thought?

2578
01:59:36,810 --> 01:59:38,270
Who would've thought?

2579
01:59:41,170 --> 01:59:43,570
Oh my god.

2580
01:59:43,810 --> 01:59:46,070
Let me fucking adjust that.

2581
01:59:46,790 --> 01:59:48,450
Oh my god.

2582
01:59:50,330 --> 01:59:52,470
Like an actual cannon.

2583
01:59:55,890 --> 01:59:57,770
That's a big boy gun, right?

2584
01:59:57,930 --> 01:59:58,190
Right there.

2585
01:59:58,850 --> 02:00:00,110
For big boys!

2586
02:00:01,590 --> 02:00:02,290
Alright.

2587
02:00:05,430 --> 02:00:06,130
Alright.

2588
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:11,390
Oh my god, this is so...

2589
02:00:11,390 --> 02:00:12,910
This is actually harder.

2590
02:00:15,670 --> 02:00:16,370
Okay.

2591
02:00:19,090 --> 02:00:20,530
Okay, I'll stop walking.

2592
02:00:23,170 --> 02:00:24,510
Oh my god.

2593
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:29,420
Hello...

2594
02:00:29,420 --> 02:00:29,740
AHH!

2595
02:00:30,820 --> 02:00:31,440
Wait.

2596
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:33,920
Why am I actually shooting my gun?

2597
02:00:37,370 --> 02:00:38,000
Wait, what?

2598
02:00:38,120 --> 02:00:38,840
I accidentally...

2599
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:40,420
My gun actually...

2600
02:00:40,420 --> 02:00:42,320
Guys, my gun jammed!

2601
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:43,900
It jammed itself!

2602
02:00:51,220 --> 02:00:52,480
It's so realistic!

2603
02:00:52,760 --> 02:00:54,120
I got a gun jam!

2604
02:00:57,200 --> 02:00:59,840
Guys, I think Alan's dead in front of me.

2605
02:01:00,980 --> 02:01:02,480
Guys, I think he's dead.

2606
02:01:04,040 --> 02:01:05,620
Now he's dead too.

2607
02:01:08,760 --> 02:01:09,360
Oh?

2608
02:01:15,630 --> 02:01:17,290
Now he's dead too.

2609
02:01:26,020 --> 02:01:26,620
Hello?

2610
02:01:33,210 --> 02:01:35,670
Oh my god, I swear they did the bait again.

2611
02:01:36,890 --> 02:01:37,490
HAHAHAHAHA!

2612
02:01:37,950 --> 02:01:39,670
He did the fucking...

2613
02:01:39,670 --> 02:01:39,930
...uh...

2614
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:41,550
The bait again on me?

2615
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:46,940
Oh, I hear somebody.

2616
02:01:51,050 --> 02:01:51,530
Okay.

2617
02:02:00,060 --> 02:02:00,880
Did I do it?

2618
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:13,240
Oh my god, he's groaning.

2619
02:02:20,130 --> 02:02:20,930
Oh my god.

2620
02:02:27,290 --> 02:02:28,010
He's right there.

2621
02:02:36,910 --> 02:02:37,790
He's right there.

2622
02:02:41,140 --> 02:02:41,940
He's right there!

2623
02:02:55,020 --> 02:02:55,680
Oh.

2624
02:02:57,520 --> 02:02:58,180
Oh.

2625
02:02:58,680 --> 02:02:58,720
Oh.

2626
02:03:02,620 --> 02:03:03,840
He's not there?

2627
02:03:08,680 --> 02:03:09,760
Where is he?

2628
02:03:18,120 --> 02:03:19,360
Where is he?

2629
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:22,500
Where is he?

2630
02:03:26,660 --> 02:03:27,720
Where is he?

2631
02:03:28,740 --> 02:03:29,820
I wait.

2632
02:03:31,560 --> 02:03:32,660
I wait.

2633
02:03:32,940 --> 02:03:33,520
I wait.

2634
02:03:35,260 --> 02:03:36,760
Where is he, guys?

2635
02:03:37,340 --> 02:03:38,700
I scared him.

2636
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:44,560
I'm scared.

2637
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:44,860
Oh...

2638
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:47,040
I'm scared.

2639
02:03:48,620 --> 02:03:50,400
Where is he?

2640
02:03:57,340 --> 02:03:58,680
Come on.

2641
02:03:58,920 --> 02:04:00,280
Come on.

2642
02:04:00,520 --> 02:04:02,680
I can wait forever.

2643
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:08,980
I'm patient.

2644
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,460
I can wait forever.

2645
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:14,840
I'm patient.

2646
02:04:15,360 --> 02:04:16,400
I'm patient.

2647
02:04:16,420 --> 02:04:18,600
I'll never move.

2648
02:04:22,480 --> 02:04:24,000
I'll never move.

2649
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:31,720
What the fuck?

2650
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:34,420
Holy shit he fucking just ran!

2651
02:04:35,040 --> 02:04:37,140
I was like what the fuck is that?

2652
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:40,420
What the fuck was that?

2653
02:04:40,780 --> 02:04:42,480
He went so fast!

2654
02:04:42,900 --> 02:04:44,380
He literally ran!

2655
02:04:49,370 --> 02:04:52,430
I was so confused!

2656
02:04:52,430 --> 02:04:56,150
I was like what the fuck just ran past me?

2657
02:04:59,050 --> 02:05:01,810
Look I got us three kills there guys.

2658
02:05:01,990 --> 02:05:03,970
I got us fucking three kills.

2659
02:05:04,210 --> 02:05:06,030
I did my job.

2660
02:05:06,550 --> 02:05:08,650
Dude went full Leeroy.

2661
02:05:08,850 --> 02:05:10,630
I was like what the fuck was that?

2662
02:05:11,490 --> 02:05:15,870
But that guy like actually just ran straight past me.

2663
02:05:16,710 --> 02:05:20,570
It like freaked me out as I didn't expect it.

2664
02:05:20,770 --> 02:05:21,770
I'm so sorry.

2665
02:05:22,430 --> 02:05:24,510
It like came out of nowhere.

2666
02:05:28,220 --> 02:05:29,300
What's he doing?

2667
02:05:35,820 --> 02:05:36,780
Oh god.

2668
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:38,240
No!

2669
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:43,130
What is that?

2670
02:05:43,230 --> 02:05:44,510
Who shot me?

2671
02:05:44,750 --> 02:05:46,110
Was there two people there?

2672
02:05:46,430 --> 02:05:49,670
I didn't check my corner if there were two people!

2673
02:05:50,430 --> 02:05:51,150
I didn't check my corner if there were two people!

2674
02:05:51,150 --> 02:05:51,430
No!

2675
02:05:55,910 --> 02:05:59,260
What the fuck doing a little jiggy dance here?

2676
02:05:59,640 --> 02:06:00,080
What the fuck doing a little jiggy dance here?

2677
02:06:00,360 --> 02:06:01,440
He's camping!

2678
02:06:02,280 --> 02:06:03,720
Alan he's camping!

2679
02:06:09,600 --> 02:06:12,280
He's camping in the bookshelves!

2680
02:06:12,280 --> 02:06:12,440
Alan!

2681
02:06:14,260 --> 02:06:15,880
That's awkward.

2682
02:06:22,820 --> 02:06:26,060
That's pretty awkward.

2683
02:06:29,750 --> 02:06:31,560
That was funny.

2684
02:06:37,150 --> 02:06:39,810
All the drones were like, what the fuck?

2685
02:06:45,210 --> 02:06:46,850
Airport, thank you for the super chat.

2686
02:06:46,990 --> 02:06:47,930
Thank you, thank you.

2687
02:06:47,930 --> 02:06:50,630
Doors and corners, that's where it gets you.

2688
02:06:50,670 --> 02:06:51,770
Thank you for the super chat.

2689
02:06:51,930 --> 02:06:52,950
Thank you, thank you.

2690
02:06:53,590 --> 02:06:55,490
I can't believe you guys traded.

2691
02:06:55,810 --> 02:07:00,950
And then all the drones just stopped and looked at it and was like, what the fuck happened?

2692
02:07:00,950 --> 02:07:03,330
What the fuck happened there?

2693
02:07:08,870 --> 02:07:09,350
Okay.

2694
02:07:11,810 --> 02:07:16,110
Okay, the beginning of this game is when we were starting to learn it was rough because we were learning.

2695
02:07:16,350 --> 02:07:18,970
But the longer we played, the funnier this game gets.

2696
02:07:25,410 --> 02:07:27,730
That was so anticlimactic.

2697
02:07:32,740 --> 02:07:33,220
Yeah.

2698
02:07:33,660 --> 02:07:39,600
The first, just for VOD watchers out there, for people who just got here and were like, oh, should I wash in the bag?

2699
02:07:39,720 --> 02:07:42,780
The first couple of games, the first few rounds, we were still learning.

2700
02:07:42,840 --> 02:07:43,780
So it was pretty rough.

2701
02:07:43,980 --> 02:07:45,740
We didn't know what the fuck we're doing.

2702
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:53,260
But then as we started learning, it's when we got to the forest is when we started getting, we started light bulb.

2703
02:08:00,330 --> 02:08:02,350
Yeah, once you start to understand it.

2704
02:08:07,480 --> 02:08:08,600
All right, guys.

2705
02:08:09,420 --> 02:08:11,460
Guys, I want to swap teams.

2706
02:08:14,600 --> 02:08:17,100
Bro, one of them has seven kills.

2707
02:08:17,460 --> 02:08:20,320
What if I just leave you guys and make my other new lobby?

2708
02:08:26,860 --> 02:08:29,260
Guys, I want to get carried.

2709
02:08:33,040 --> 02:08:34,880
No swapping, coward.

2710
02:08:35,740 --> 02:08:37,200
Where's your loyalty?

2711
02:08:37,200 --> 02:08:39,660
We're getting all three.

2712
02:08:39,860 --> 02:08:43,080
There's no loyalty when you start getting all three.

2713
02:08:43,340 --> 02:08:46,720
Oh, my God.

2714
02:08:51,480 --> 02:08:52,300
All right.

2715
02:08:53,480 --> 02:08:54,700
I'm noticing.

2716
02:08:54,920 --> 02:08:55,540
Yeah.

2717
02:08:55,640 --> 02:08:56,060
Alan.

2718
02:08:56,220 --> 02:08:57,660
Alan's the common demon.

2719
02:08:58,200 --> 02:09:01,400
When he's on my team, I lose.

2720
02:09:02,860 --> 02:09:04,640
It's not the other way around.

2721
02:09:08,090 --> 02:09:08,730
Okay.

2722
02:09:12,180 --> 02:09:13,280
Oh, shit.

2723
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:14,380
Somebody died there.

2724
02:09:18,930 --> 02:09:19,570
Okay.

2725
02:09:22,770 --> 02:09:27,490
All I'm saying is the pattern here is Alan, not me.

2726
02:09:30,730 --> 02:09:32,970
Look, I have three killers guys.

2727
02:09:38,690 --> 02:09:39,330
Oh.

2728
02:09:41,770 --> 02:09:42,410
Whoa.

2729
02:09:42,610 --> 02:09:43,090
Oh.

2730
02:09:43,090 --> 02:09:43,270
Oh.

2731
02:09:43,270 --> 02:09:43,290
Oh.

2732
02:09:43,290 --> 02:09:43,370
Oh.

2733
02:09:47,160 --> 02:09:49,600
Whoa, I think that's a person over there, guys.

2734
02:09:52,140 --> 02:09:53,900
Guys, I think he's trying to shoot me.

2735
02:09:57,100 --> 02:09:58,380
But what if like...

2736
02:09:58,940 --> 02:10:00,300
What if I just stand here?

2737
02:10:03,830 --> 02:10:05,270
What if I just stand here?

2738
02:10:06,190 --> 02:10:08,290
There's no way he's gonna land that nade.

2739
02:10:09,170 --> 02:10:11,090
What if I just stand right here?

2740
02:10:12,550 --> 02:10:14,010
Is that person over there?

2741
02:10:23,400 --> 02:10:24,120
Oh god.

2742
02:10:24,120 --> 02:10:25,740
Oh god, that's Alan!

2743
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:27,460
That's me, you fucker!

2744
02:10:27,740 --> 02:10:29,720
Alan, you fucking idiot!

2745
02:10:30,840 --> 02:10:32,100
He shot me!

2746
02:10:39,900 --> 02:10:41,500
I told you!

2747
02:10:41,640 --> 02:10:44,540
I called you, elevator!

2748
02:10:45,080 --> 02:10:46,680
It was not me!

2749
02:10:47,140 --> 02:10:48,400
It was Alan!

2750
02:10:48,820 --> 02:10:50,320
I told you!

2751
02:10:50,680 --> 02:10:52,780
I fucking told you!

2752
02:10:55,260 --> 02:10:57,700
I knew it wasn't me.

2753
02:10:57,720 --> 02:11:00,720
I fucking knew it wasn't me!

2754
02:11:03,500 --> 02:11:04,600
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

2755
02:11:06,100 --> 02:11:07,460
Wait, wait, wait.

2756
02:11:07,500 --> 02:11:08,620
Where's the enemy?

2757
02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:12,040
I fucking knew it.

2758
02:11:12,060 --> 02:11:12,960
I knew it.

2759
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:14,660
I knew it.

2760
02:11:16,920 --> 02:11:17,780
Oh god.

2761
02:11:20,440 --> 02:11:21,560
It's one person!

2762
02:11:21,680 --> 02:11:22,340
Run at him!

2763
02:11:22,500 --> 02:11:23,120
You'll be fine!

2764
02:11:24,340 --> 02:11:25,240
Oh god.

2765
02:11:25,300 --> 02:11:25,900
No!

2766
02:11:26,040 --> 02:11:26,820
Not me!

2767
02:11:27,720 --> 02:11:29,440
I was trying to help you!

2768
02:11:30,220 --> 02:11:32,460
I was trying to help!

2769
02:11:43,140 --> 02:11:44,640
Please, someone kill him.

2770
02:11:46,380 --> 02:11:46,760
Please.

2771
02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:48,180
It's one person.

2772
02:11:48,280 --> 02:11:48,560
Yes!

2773
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:49,720
Yes!

2774
02:11:51,340 --> 02:11:52,100
Yes!

2775
02:11:56,320 --> 02:11:58,520
I can't believe it!

2776
02:11:58,700 --> 02:12:00,140
He let him...

2777
02:12:00,880 --> 02:12:05,080
If I didn't care so much about my KDA, I would have shot him right there.

2778
02:12:09,460 --> 02:12:16,040
To be fair to you, I was there for like the entire time!

2779
02:12:16,180 --> 02:12:18,900
I kept him my entire game!

2780
02:12:25,430 --> 02:12:26,470
Oh god.

2781
02:12:26,550 --> 02:12:30,290
I feel like the abandoned hospital is scarier than... is scary though.

2782
02:12:32,110 --> 02:12:33,310
Oh god.

2783
02:12:33,310 --> 02:12:33,310
I feel like the abandoned hospital is scarier than...

2784
02:12:33,310 --> 02:12:33,310
is scary though.

2785
02:12:33,310 --> 02:12:33,890
I'm gonna go around.

2786
02:12:34,610 --> 02:12:35,750
I'm gonna go around.

2787
02:12:39,090 --> 02:12:39,430
Alright.

2788
02:12:41,170 --> 02:12:42,330
I'm gonna go this way.

2789
02:12:43,090 --> 02:12:44,010
Well, Alan's dead.

2790
02:12:44,910 --> 02:12:45,970
That was fast.

2791
02:12:47,110 --> 02:12:49,370
That was a very fast death for Alan.

2792
02:12:52,370 --> 02:12:56,040
Does he see me?

2793
02:13:01,180 --> 02:13:05,900
Ba ba ba da ba ba ba da ba ba.

2794
02:13:05,900 --> 02:13:06,980
What the fuck?

2795
02:13:08,600 --> 02:13:11,220
What the fuck was he doing there?

2796
02:13:14,530 --> 02:13:15,510
Is that good?

2797
02:13:15,770 --> 02:13:16,550
Good drone?

2798
02:13:16,590 --> 02:13:17,030
Bad drone?

2799
02:13:17,710 --> 02:13:19,410
Good drone or bad drone?

2800
02:13:20,710 --> 02:13:22,390
What the... Oh my god.

2801
02:13:22,890 --> 02:13:24,070
Well, he's dead.

2802
02:13:27,700 --> 02:13:28,520
Guys, I...

2803
02:13:29,300 --> 02:13:31,820
I think Shadow's gonna die soon, guys.

2804
02:13:32,080 --> 02:13:32,340
Shhh.

2805
02:13:34,020 --> 02:13:37,890
Wait, my friend's dead.

2806
02:13:38,030 --> 02:13:38,570
Oh shit.

2807
02:13:48,470 --> 02:13:49,750
He doesn't know.

2808
02:13:53,440 --> 02:13:54,660
I can't see.

2809
02:13:54,740 --> 02:13:58,740
If I can't see where they are, he can't either.

2810
02:13:59,380 --> 02:14:00,300
Guys, please.

2811
02:14:01,300 --> 02:14:02,160
Fuck off!

2812
02:14:15,820 --> 02:14:16,340
Stop.

2813
02:14:16,940 --> 02:14:18,060
Stop, you fuckers.

2814
02:14:18,180 --> 02:14:19,000
Fuck off!

2815
02:14:28,250 --> 02:14:28,770
No!

2816
02:14:28,770 --> 02:14:29,370
No no no no!

2817
02:14:32,920 --> 02:14:34,180
I'm bleeding so much.

2818
02:14:37,690 --> 02:14:39,170
I'm bleeding so much, guys.

2819
02:14:39,530 --> 02:14:41,650
This might be the end of me, guys.

2820
02:14:42,810 --> 02:14:44,970
This could be the end of me.

2821
02:14:46,930 --> 02:14:49,290
This could be the end of me, guys.

2822
02:14:51,950 --> 02:14:53,470
Guys, I'm not doing so well.

2823
02:14:53,670 --> 02:14:54,810
I'm not doing...

2824
02:14:54,810 --> 02:14:56,570
Guys, I'm bleeding a lot, guys.

2825
02:15:01,010 --> 02:15:03,130
I'm bleeding so much.

2826
02:15:05,670 --> 02:15:07,830
They gotta find me first.

2827
02:15:08,210 --> 02:15:10,470
They gotta find me first.

2828
02:15:11,090 --> 02:15:11,630
I'm bleeding so much.

2829
02:15:12,430 --> 02:15:13,930
I'm despairing so heavily.

2830
02:15:16,790 --> 02:15:22,370
That one drone was like, hey looks like Dusty Little's underwear.

2831
02:15:22,370 --> 02:15:25,830
That one drone over there is like what you doing over here?

2832
02:15:26,390 --> 02:15:27,510
This is the end.

2833
02:15:27,810 --> 02:15:29,830
This is the end everybody.

2834
02:15:30,130 --> 02:15:34,230
There's no... we're at an abandoned hospital, but there's no bandages!

2835
02:15:37,170 --> 02:15:39,950
Is there no medical supplies in this abandoned hospital?

2836
02:15:50,310 --> 02:15:53,210
Hey guys, I'm seeing some colors right now.

2837
02:15:53,490 --> 02:15:55,610
I ain't looking so good.

2838
02:15:58,370 --> 02:16:02,490
Oh no, I ain't looking so good, guys.

2839
02:16:04,230 --> 02:16:07,910
I'm seeing... oh... someone please.

2840
02:16:08,330 --> 02:16:10,430
I need a blood transplant.

2841
02:16:12,290 --> 02:16:16,090
I need a blood transplant, please.

2842
02:16:19,050 --> 02:16:20,450
Oh no.

2843
02:16:21,970 --> 02:16:24,070
I'm breathing so heavily.

2844
02:16:27,470 --> 02:16:30,150
Please put me out of my misery.

2845
02:16:33,580 --> 02:16:34,460
We're...

2846
02:16:36,820 --> 02:16:41,980
Oh my god.

2847
02:16:42,940 --> 02:16:45,040
Oh my god.

2848
02:16:45,480 --> 02:16:47,920
Alright, well somebody put me out of my misery.

2849
02:16:49,040 --> 02:16:49,500
That's good.

2850
02:16:51,300 --> 02:16:52,280
I've got my...

2851
02:16:53,120 --> 02:16:54,960
It's okay, they put me out of my misery.

2852
02:16:54,980 --> 02:16:55,520
We're gonna rush.

2853
02:16:55,840 --> 02:16:56,680
We're rushing B.

2854
02:16:57,600 --> 02:16:58,740
I don't care anymore.

2855
02:16:58,800 --> 02:16:59,620
I'm gonna rush B.

2856
02:17:00,540 --> 02:17:01,100
Let's go!

2857
02:17:01,640 --> 02:17:03,120
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!

2858
02:17:09,130 --> 02:17:09,530
What?

2859
02:17:16,200 --> 02:17:18,080
Why does this one guy...

2860
02:17:20,360 --> 02:17:20,760
Alright.

2861
02:17:34,080 --> 02:17:35,460
Wait, did we kick him out?

2862
02:17:35,680 --> 02:17:38,040
Wait, we actually kicked him out!

2863
02:17:38,240 --> 02:17:40,480
Oh my god!

2864
02:17:40,800 --> 02:17:42,060
Oh my god!

2865
02:17:47,460 --> 02:17:52,660
You thought team killing the host was a good idea.

2866
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:55,960
Hmm...

2867
02:17:57,160 --> 02:17:58,480
Toki, please.

2868
02:17:59,160 --> 02:18:00,620
We're already losing!

2869
02:18:01,180 --> 02:18:02,400
What do we lose?

2870
02:18:02,600 --> 02:18:03,160
Nothing!

2871
02:18:03,340 --> 02:18:05,360
We lose nothing for that.

2872
02:18:06,200 --> 02:18:08,320
Dude, I can't kick people on the enemy team.

2873
02:18:08,980 --> 02:18:10,420
If I could, I would.

2874
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:12,300
Alright, Mr. Chucky.

2875
02:18:12,780 --> 02:18:15,380
You better impress me, you know.

2876
02:18:19,360 --> 02:18:21,020
Team killing the host?

2877
02:18:21,660 --> 02:18:22,500
That's wild.

2878
02:18:23,580 --> 02:18:25,080
Ellen, if you do it...

2879
02:18:25,080 --> 02:18:26,720
Ellen, if you team kill me again...

2880
02:18:26,720 --> 02:18:27,120
Ellen...

2881
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:28,620
If you team kill me again...

2882
02:18:28,620 --> 02:18:29,660
I don't care.

2883
02:18:29,900 --> 02:18:31,200
I don't fucking care.

2884
02:18:33,980 --> 02:18:35,020
There he is.

2885
02:18:35,700 --> 02:18:37,880
I'm gonna tell somebody that he's over here.

2886
02:18:38,480 --> 02:18:40,440
There must be a person here.

2887
02:18:40,940 --> 02:18:42,440
I'll be like, follow me.

2888
02:18:42,720 --> 02:18:44,300
I know where people are.

2889
02:18:45,020 --> 02:18:45,500
Okay.

2890
02:18:50,120 --> 02:18:51,000
Where are they?

2891
02:18:51,360 --> 02:18:54,680
I wish I could threaten to kick the enemy team as well.

2892
02:18:54,920 --> 02:18:57,000
And be like, if you kill me, I'm gonna kick you.

2893
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,220
To the enemy team.

2894
02:19:02,360 --> 02:19:03,440
Where is...

2895
02:19:03,440 --> 02:19:04,340
Oh my god, there's like...

2896
02:19:04,340 --> 02:19:05,400
Is that dead body there?

2897
02:19:06,540 --> 02:19:07,380
Where is that?

2898
02:19:07,620 --> 02:19:08,420
Where are the...

2899
02:19:08,850 --> 02:19:10,080
Doki, what the fuck?

2900
02:19:11,180 --> 02:19:11,720
Guys...

2901
02:19:11,720 --> 02:19:13,320
Yeah, I'll do it.

2902
02:19:13,770 --> 02:19:14,520
But I can't.

2903
02:19:14,600 --> 02:19:16,420
The game already Doki-proofed.

2904
02:19:16,420 --> 02:19:18,500
The game Doki-proofed already.

2905
02:19:19,040 --> 02:19:20,220
So I can't...

2906
02:19:20,220 --> 02:19:21,980
I can't kick the enemy team.

2907
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:23,800
I would if I could.

2908
02:19:25,760 --> 02:19:26,840
I would 100%.

2909
02:19:26,840 --> 02:19:26,980
I would 100%.

2910
02:19:26,980 --> 02:19:27,940
100% do it.

2911
02:19:28,060 --> 02:19:29,020
You know I would.

2912
02:19:29,860 --> 02:19:31,140
You know I would, chat.

2913
02:19:31,320 --> 02:19:32,360
I would fucking do it.

2914
02:19:35,220 --> 02:19:37,800
I put you out of your misery.

2915
02:19:38,060 --> 02:19:38,440
What?

2916
02:19:40,360 --> 02:19:41,960
What did you mean?

2917
02:19:42,520 --> 02:19:44,560
Chat, thank you for the super chat.

2918
02:19:44,720 --> 02:19:45,980
Thank you, thank you.

2919
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:51,920
I can't believe it.

2920
02:19:51,940 --> 02:19:53,000
They knew my plan.

2921
02:19:53,600 --> 02:19:55,160
They knew my plan.

2922
02:19:59,200 --> 02:20:02,100
Guys, this emo guy fucking has one death.

2923
02:20:02,220 --> 02:20:03,260
What are we doing?

2924
02:20:08,200 --> 02:20:09,840
What are we fucking doing?

2925
02:20:13,360 --> 02:20:14,680
Oh my god.

2926
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:19,000
Holy shit.

2927
02:20:20,240 --> 02:20:21,360
I was following...

2928
02:20:21,360 --> 02:20:22,680
I didn't tell you to shoot me.

2929
02:20:22,780 --> 02:20:24,360
I told you to shoot Alan.

2930
02:20:26,360 --> 02:20:27,940
What the fuck was that?

2931
02:20:28,380 --> 02:20:29,220
Oh no.

2932
02:20:29,240 --> 02:20:31,840
Some guy is being too realistic with this game.

2933
02:20:38,730 --> 02:20:40,910
He was like, shut, shut up.

2934
02:20:41,170 --> 02:20:42,310
Shut the fuck up.

2935
02:20:45,910 --> 02:20:46,990
Oh my god.

2936
02:20:48,370 --> 02:20:49,350
He was like...

2937
02:20:50,510 --> 02:20:52,330
Oh wait, there he is.

2938
02:20:52,550 --> 02:20:53,730
Why are you shooting?

2939
02:20:55,690 --> 02:20:56,750
Did you get him?

2940
02:20:58,470 --> 02:20:59,410
Did you get him?

2941
02:21:00,430 --> 02:21:01,950
Okay, I don't think he got him.

2942
02:21:03,170 --> 02:21:05,210
I don't think he got him.

2943
02:21:05,430 --> 02:21:08,050
I don't think he got him.

2944
02:21:08,050 --> 02:21:08,330
Bro!

2945
02:21:09,290 --> 02:21:11,170
This guy is too good!

2946
02:21:13,350 --> 02:21:14,950
Somebody stop him!

2947
02:21:15,490 --> 02:21:15,790
Somebody stop him!

2948
02:21:15,790 --> 02:21:16,670
Okay, we all rush B.

2949
02:21:17,330 --> 02:21:18,910
Guys, we all rush B.

2950
02:21:18,990 --> 02:21:19,870
Oh wait, we're on the other side.

2951
02:21:20,410 --> 02:21:21,410
Wait, this is...

2952
02:21:21,950 --> 02:21:24,490
We all rush, we rush, we run, we run!

2953
02:21:25,250 --> 02:21:26,650
He can't Dragoon!

2954
02:21:27,050 --> 02:21:28,450
Dragonborn can't kill us all!

2955
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:37,700
Okay, maybe he can.

2956
02:21:39,980 --> 02:21:42,260
Guys, maybe he can kill us all.

2957
02:21:44,960 --> 02:21:48,320
I got a little scared when I saw him shooting through the hallway.

2958
02:21:48,780 --> 02:21:49,260
Chat.

2959
02:21:50,640 --> 02:21:52,180
I got a little scared.

2960
02:21:55,660 --> 02:21:57,280
I don't know, it just didn't seem right.

2961
02:22:14,520 --> 02:22:16,300
I didn't shoot him!

2962
02:22:16,720 --> 02:22:19,540
Where is he?

2963
02:22:21,320 --> 02:22:23,880
That had to be the emo guy.

2964
02:22:24,160 --> 02:22:25,420
That had to be him.

2965
02:22:25,720 --> 02:22:27,560
That shot clearly landed!

2966
02:22:29,460 --> 02:22:31,660
That shot was such a land.

2967
02:22:32,620 --> 02:22:35,340
I refuse to believe it didn't land.

2968
02:22:35,820 --> 02:22:36,040
I refuse to believe it didn't land.

2969
02:22:36,040 --> 02:22:38,040
How did... yes, how did none of it hit?

2970
02:22:39,740 --> 02:22:41,160
There's no way!

2971
02:22:44,940 --> 02:22:46,480
What are you guys trying to shoot?

2972
02:22:47,160 --> 02:22:48,440
There's nobody there.

2973
02:22:49,920 --> 02:22:50,960
Oh my god.

2974
02:22:51,020 --> 02:22:52,100
What happened here?

2975
02:22:52,660 --> 02:22:54,920
What the fuck happened here?

2976
02:22:55,520 --> 02:22:56,540
Holy shit.

2977
02:22:56,720 --> 02:23:00,840
Is this what happened when I was like rushed here and then like everybody rushed here except for me?

2978
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:02,380
Is that what happened?

2979
02:23:03,700 --> 02:23:05,280
He's built different.

2980
02:23:05,660 --> 02:23:06,720
Bro, he's still alive.

2981
02:23:07,080 --> 02:23:08,700
He still has one death.

2982
02:23:08,780 --> 02:23:10,300
That means he's still alive, chat.

2983
02:23:12,220 --> 02:23:14,220
Guys, he's still alive!

2984
02:23:15,180 --> 02:23:17,020
He's roaming the halls!

2985
02:23:18,680 --> 02:23:19,320
He's still alive!

2986
02:23:19,320 --> 02:23:23,080
I hate that it touched the ground like once and then my drone dies.

2987
02:23:23,600 --> 02:23:25,140
I can't believe it.

2988
02:23:25,200 --> 02:23:26,480
This is the military!

2989
02:23:27,080 --> 02:23:33,640
We spent billions of dollars on drones We spent billions of dollars on drones for just a drone to touch the floor and it died?

2990
02:23:36,640 --> 02:23:42,540
Like, what's the point of spending billions of dollars?

2991
02:23:43,560 --> 02:23:44,200
What's the point of spending billions of dollars?

2992
02:23:44,220 --> 02:23:48,460
Do you know how much the US military spends on the budget?

2993
02:23:48,860 --> 02:23:49,520
spends on the budget?

2994
02:23:51,080 --> 02:23:53,300
How is this military grade?

2995
02:23:53,440 --> 02:23:55,240
I can't believe it.

2996
02:23:55,300 --> 02:23:57,720
I can't believe this is military grade.

2997
02:24:00,010 --> 02:24:01,820
Truly like real life.

2998
02:24:02,220 --> 02:24:05,540
Military grade don't mean shit.

2999
02:24:06,900 --> 02:24:09,080
I swear, this game...

3000
02:24:10,240 --> 02:24:13,960
This game is like actually a microwave.

3001
02:24:14,220 --> 02:24:15,380
For my PC!

3002
02:24:15,840 --> 02:24:17,000
Oh my god!

3003
02:24:17,060 --> 02:24:20,940
I don't think it's helping that playing all of this on epic graphics.

3004
02:24:21,260 --> 02:24:22,660
Hey, but it looks good.

3005
02:24:22,980 --> 02:24:24,800
It looks pretty good though.

3006
02:24:25,780 --> 02:24:26,940
Not gonna lie.

3007
02:24:27,200 --> 02:24:28,620
Not gonna lie.

3008
02:24:32,800 --> 02:24:34,540
This is my stress test.

3009
02:24:35,060 --> 02:24:37,740
This game is my stress test game.

3010
02:24:38,020 --> 02:24:38,580
This game is my stress test game.

3011
02:24:38,580 --> 02:24:39,600
We know how...

3012
02:24:39,600 --> 02:24:40,060
Whoa!

3013
02:24:40,100 --> 02:24:40,500
He's right there!

3014
02:24:40,500 --> 02:24:41,180
No!

3015
02:24:43,800 --> 02:24:44,780
Is that him?

3016
02:24:44,960 --> 02:24:45,880
Did he live again?

3017
02:24:46,560 --> 02:24:47,080
Bro!

3018
02:24:47,100 --> 02:24:47,680
It's him!

3019
02:24:48,400 --> 02:24:51,280
You know it's him cause he has 14 kills now!

3020
02:24:52,140 --> 02:24:52,880
You know it's him cause he has 14 kills now!

3021
02:24:53,080 --> 02:24:53,700
Who's he?

3022
02:24:54,160 --> 02:24:55,200
What am I spectating?

3023
02:24:56,640 --> 02:24:57,440
Who is this?

3024
02:24:59,900 --> 02:25:01,320
What is he seeing?

3025
02:25:04,900 --> 02:25:06,100
Oh my god.

3026
02:25:06,100 --> 02:25:07,000
It's always him.

3027
02:25:07,320 --> 02:25:07,980
Oh my god.

3028
02:25:07,980 --> 02:25:07,980
It's always him.

3029
02:25:07,980 --> 02:25:09,460
Can I swap teams?

3030
02:25:09,760 --> 02:25:10,200
Please.

3031
02:25:10,420 --> 02:25:11,820
Can someone leave?

3032
02:25:17,740 --> 02:25:21,580
Can somebody leave on the end of the video?

3033
02:25:26,340 --> 02:25:27,820
Hey guys.

3034
02:25:27,920 --> 02:25:32,280
It would be so funny if someone just leaves.

3035
02:25:32,280 --> 02:25:32,540
Please.

3036
02:25:37,540 --> 02:25:39,520
It would be so hilarious.

3037
02:25:42,560 --> 02:25:43,080
Shoutout.

3038
02:25:43,120 --> 02:25:44,360
Thank you for the super chat.

3039
02:25:44,480 --> 02:25:44,760
Thank you.

3040
02:25:44,820 --> 02:25:45,420
Thank you.

3041
02:25:45,420 --> 02:25:48,960
You said and I quote put me out of my misery.

3042
02:25:49,220 --> 02:25:51,340
Good soldiers follow orders.

3043
02:25:51,580 --> 02:25:53,040
Thank you for the super chat.

3044
02:25:53,200 --> 02:25:53,540
Thank you.

3045
02:25:53,560 --> 02:25:54,160
Thank you.

3046
02:25:56,340 --> 02:25:58,160
Oh my god.

3047
02:25:59,660 --> 02:26:00,180
Guys.

3048
02:26:00,180 --> 02:26:00,440
Hey.

3049
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:01,780
Hey guys.

3050
02:26:02,080 --> 02:26:02,360
Drag.

3051
02:26:02,480 --> 02:26:02,660
Okay.

3052
02:26:02,720 --> 02:26:07,620
If you are a real dragoon you would leave the enemy.

3053
02:26:07,820 --> 02:26:10,500
Someone on the enemy team would leave.

3054
02:26:11,660 --> 02:26:12,020
Right.

3055
02:26:12,140 --> 02:26:13,020
Oh my god.

3056
02:26:13,040 --> 02:26:13,640
He did it.

3057
02:26:13,820 --> 02:26:14,540
Holy.

3058
02:26:14,640 --> 02:26:16,080
I've always believed in you.

3059
02:26:16,260 --> 02:26:19,040
I God can bleed.

3060
02:26:19,440 --> 02:26:20,620
He bleeds.

3061
02:26:20,620 --> 02:26:21,140
Guys.

3062
02:26:22,240 --> 02:26:22,960
Guys.

3063
02:26:23,540 --> 02:26:24,260
He.

3064
02:26:24,420 --> 02:26:24,780
Wait.

3065
02:26:28,960 --> 02:26:29,680
Nooooooo.

3066
02:26:30,200 --> 02:26:30,920
.

3067
02:26:30,920 --> 02:26:31,200
.

3068
02:26:35,820 --> 02:26:40,660
No, please, please, please, please...

3069
02:26:42,780 --> 02:26:48,720
Okay, if you were a real dragoon, you would also leave again.

3070
02:26:57,700 --> 02:27:03,000
If you were a real dragoon, another person would leave.

3071
02:27:05,500 --> 02:27:07,700
Just take the L.

3072
02:27:07,860 --> 02:27:09,840
All I'm saying is...

3073
02:27:10,220 --> 02:27:13,360
Any real gooners out there?

3074
02:27:15,560 --> 02:27:17,720
Any real...

3075
02:27:20,240 --> 02:27:22,500
Any real gooners?

3076
02:27:29,360 --> 02:27:30,780
Toki, what?

3077
02:27:31,100 --> 02:27:33,360
Any real dragooners out there?

3078
02:27:35,520 --> 02:27:36,420
Any real gooners?

3079
02:27:37,540 --> 02:27:39,420
No, because I still have 6 kills.

3080
02:27:42,400 --> 02:27:42,840
What?

3081
02:27:45,300 --> 02:27:46,680
Oh, my God!

3082
02:27:49,480 --> 02:27:50,360
No... NOOOOO!

3083
02:27:50,360 --> 02:27:51,620
I hit the ceiling!

3084
02:27:53,920 --> 02:27:56,400
Kaiori, I decided to leave because it's getting really late for me.

3085
02:27:56,420 --> 02:27:58,440
But thank you so much for the games, Toki.

3086
02:27:58,480 --> 02:27:59,960
It's fun as fuck to troll you.

3087
02:28:00,120 --> 02:28:02,100
Kaiori, thank you for the super chat.

3088
02:28:02,220 --> 02:28:03,300
Thank you, thank you.

3089
02:28:04,340 --> 02:28:04,780
NOOOOO!

3090
02:28:04,780 --> 02:28:05,020
Wow!

3091
02:28:05,020 --> 02:28:07,600
Now Jam's gonna get a free win!

3092
02:28:09,880 --> 02:28:11,320
Peter, thank you for the super chat.

3093
02:28:11,420 --> 02:28:12,140
Thank you, thank you.

3094
02:28:12,140 --> 02:28:12,860
Silly dookie.

3095
02:28:12,940 --> 02:28:14,740
That's one of Murphy's rule of combat.

3096
02:28:14,880 --> 02:28:18,880
Never forget that your weapon was made by the lowest bidder.

3097
02:28:18,980 --> 02:28:20,440
Thank you for the super chat.

3098
02:28:20,520 --> 02:28:21,740
Thank you, thank you.

3099
02:28:21,960 --> 02:28:22,760
What are you?

3100
02:28:22,880 --> 02:28:23,940
Are you camping?

3101
02:28:24,240 --> 02:28:25,400
Who is this?

3102
02:28:25,840 --> 02:28:28,420
Okay, but we know that Emu can bleed now.

3103
02:28:28,720 --> 02:28:31,180
We know that God can bleed.

3104
02:28:31,960 --> 02:28:33,820
He's not truly a God!

3105
02:28:34,400 --> 02:28:35,960
He can bleed!

3106
02:28:41,260 --> 02:28:42,340
We know.

3107
02:28:42,920 --> 02:28:44,100
Okay, never mind.

3108
02:28:44,300 --> 02:28:45,100
Except for...

3109
02:28:45,100 --> 02:28:47,280
Well, to be fair, he didn't die to Emu.

3110
02:28:47,380 --> 02:28:48,620
Emu still has 14 kills.

3111
02:28:49,140 --> 02:28:51,220
If he bleeds, he can die.

3112
02:28:54,580 --> 02:28:55,680
So fair.

3113
02:28:55,980 --> 02:28:58,000
Wait, another person left?!

3114
02:28:58,660 --> 02:28:59,900
Okay, okay.

3115
02:28:59,940 --> 02:29:01,060
All I'm saying, guys.

3116
02:29:01,180 --> 02:29:01,580
Guys, guys.

3117
02:29:01,960 --> 02:29:03,860
Jam's, Jam's, Jam's.

3118
02:29:03,900 --> 02:29:05,020
You just joined in?

3119
02:29:05,280 --> 02:29:06,100
You just...

3120
02:29:06,100 --> 02:29:07,880
Jam's, why don't you like wait a sec?

3121
02:29:07,960 --> 02:29:09,200
You leave right now?

3122
02:29:09,580 --> 02:29:11,780
Wait like 10 seconds?

3123
02:29:12,360 --> 02:29:13,260
Jam's, Jam's.

3124
02:29:13,360 --> 02:29:13,960
I'm saying.

3125
02:29:14,060 --> 02:29:15,660
You leave right now.

3126
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:19,460
And then you join back 10 seconds later.

3127
02:29:20,220 --> 02:29:20,780
Jam's.

3128
02:29:24,400 --> 02:29:26,840
That's all I'm saying, Jam's.

3129
02:29:27,140 --> 02:29:28,080
Jam's, come on.

3130
02:29:28,100 --> 02:29:29,060
It's so funny.

3131
02:29:29,100 --> 02:29:29,860
You need...

3132
02:29:31,180 --> 02:29:31,700
Wait!

3133
02:29:33,300 --> 02:29:34,020
Wait!

3134
02:29:34,180 --> 02:29:34,900
What?!

3135
02:29:34,900 --> 02:29:38,050
Let me, let me!

3136
02:29:38,730 --> 02:29:39,450
No!

3137
02:29:39,810 --> 02:29:44,610
I can't even play on the other team if I want to!

3138
02:29:45,110 --> 02:29:46,570
I can't even!

3139
02:29:46,870 --> 02:29:47,990
I can't!

3140
02:29:48,090 --> 02:29:48,810
No!

3141
02:29:49,010 --> 02:29:49,550
Okay.

3142
02:29:50,210 --> 02:29:50,730
It's okay.

3143
02:29:50,810 --> 02:29:51,870
Nobody join back.

3144
02:29:52,150 --> 02:29:54,350
There's no way Emu can kill us all.

3145
02:29:54,610 --> 02:29:55,730
Now, now...

3146
02:29:56,210 --> 02:29:57,670
Now we can win.

3147
02:29:58,070 --> 02:30:00,430
Now it's a 5v3.

3148
02:30:03,410 --> 02:30:04,130
It worked.

3149
02:30:05,250 --> 02:30:06,910
It worked, guys.

3150
02:30:08,190 --> 02:30:09,470
It worked, everybody.

3151
02:30:11,210 --> 02:30:12,750
They fell for it.

3152
02:30:13,490 --> 02:30:14,130
What?

3153
02:30:14,210 --> 02:30:16,070
They fell for it now!

3154
02:30:16,150 --> 02:30:17,570
It's a 5v3!

3155
02:30:18,130 --> 02:30:20,710
They fucking fell for it!

3156
02:30:24,890 --> 02:30:25,530
Nerds.

3157
02:30:26,090 --> 02:30:27,570
Wait, how did he die?

3158
02:30:29,710 --> 02:30:31,710
Wait, how the fuck did he die?

3159
02:30:33,410 --> 02:30:34,390
Is he in there?

3160
02:30:36,990 --> 02:30:38,690
They fell for it!

3161
02:30:43,090 --> 02:30:45,530
Oh my god!

3162
02:30:48,490 --> 02:30:49,370
Finally!

3163
02:30:52,210 --> 02:30:54,130
We did it, guys!

3164
02:30:55,250 --> 02:30:56,790
We did it!

3165
02:31:00,750 --> 02:31:03,390
We fucking did it, guys!

3166
02:31:03,390 --> 02:31:07,730
They thought I wanted to be on the enemy team.

3167
02:31:08,050 --> 02:31:11,830
But I just wanted to make it a 5v3.

3168
02:31:12,250 --> 02:31:14,630
It was planned all along.

3169
02:31:17,490 --> 02:31:19,290
This is totally...

3170
02:31:19,290 --> 02:31:23,730
You literally have a guy that has 14 plus kills.

3171
02:31:23,930 --> 02:31:26,170
This is as fair as it gets.

3172
02:31:28,330 --> 02:31:30,370
They need chess.

3173
02:31:33,750 --> 02:31:36,850
They fell... I can't believe they fell for it.

3174
02:31:41,160 --> 02:31:42,150
Oh, shit!

3175
02:31:44,430 --> 02:31:45,090
No!

3176
02:31:45,710 --> 02:31:47,090
He's over here!

3177
02:31:49,130 --> 02:31:50,810
5v3, I got you.

3178
02:31:51,030 --> 02:31:52,990
Jams, thank you for the super chat.

3179
02:31:53,130 --> 02:31:53,490
Thank you.

3180
02:31:53,550 --> 02:31:54,170
Thank you.

3181
02:31:56,090 --> 02:31:56,750
Wait!

3182
02:31:57,270 --> 02:31:59,370
Why is my team a 2v4?

3183
02:31:59,370 --> 02:32:02,410
Why is my team 4?

3184
02:32:02,930 --> 02:32:04,030
Who left?

3185
02:32:07,150 --> 02:32:07,790
No!

3186
02:32:12,630 --> 02:32:14,930
I can't believe it.

3187
02:32:14,950 --> 02:32:15,870
Now we're 4!

3188
02:32:18,410 --> 02:32:19,890
And they have 5!

3189
02:32:21,790 --> 02:32:24,110
Jams, do you want to be on the winning team, Jams?

3190
02:32:24,330 --> 02:32:25,390
Jams, come on!

3191
02:32:25,850 --> 02:32:26,430
Join me.

3192
02:32:26,550 --> 02:32:29,050
We have a spot for you, Jams.

3193
02:32:30,110 --> 02:32:31,650
Jams, get over here!

3194
02:32:38,620 --> 02:32:39,740
Jams, come on!

3195
02:32:40,640 --> 02:32:42,980
Get over here, Jams!

3196
02:32:45,940 --> 02:32:48,720
It will be so fun, Jams!

3197
02:32:55,200 --> 02:32:56,200
Jams, come on!

3198
02:32:56,740 --> 02:32:58,600
Now you can be on this team!

3199
02:33:00,660 --> 02:33:01,860
Yeah, Jams!

3200
02:33:01,860 --> 02:33:02,080
Look!

3201
02:33:02,140 --> 02:33:04,100
You get to be on this team!

3202
02:33:06,160 --> 02:33:06,980
Look at that!

3203
02:33:09,140 --> 02:33:10,080
Look at that!

3204
02:33:10,540 --> 02:33:10,980
Look!

3205
02:33:10,980 --> 02:33:11,180
See?

3206
02:33:11,400 --> 02:33:13,120
Now Jams is on my team!

3207
02:33:14,720 --> 02:33:16,340
Now you get to be on my team!

3208
02:33:16,620 --> 02:33:17,960
Is that what you guys wanted?

3209
02:33:19,440 --> 02:33:19,880
Whoa!

3210
02:33:26,980 --> 02:33:27,860
Holy shit!

3211
02:33:28,980 --> 02:33:29,420
Whoa!

3212
02:33:30,580 --> 02:33:31,840
Please be nice to me.

3213
02:33:31,840 --> 02:33:35,500
Guys, if you're a real Dragoon, you let me have one more kill.

3214
02:33:36,080 --> 02:33:41,520
Guys, if you're a real Dragoon, you let me have one more kill so I can have more kills than everybody.

3215
02:33:41,580 --> 02:33:42,660
So I can be Top Fragger.

3216
02:33:43,080 --> 02:33:43,480
Guys.

3217
02:33:44,700 --> 02:33:46,560
You let me be Top Fragger.

3218
02:33:47,120 --> 02:33:47,520
Guys.

3219
02:33:48,360 --> 02:33:48,760
Guys!

3220
02:33:51,240 --> 02:33:56,420
Guys, I thought you wanted me to be Top Fragger.

3221
02:33:56,720 --> 02:33:58,620
I need to know my corners.

3222
02:33:59,340 --> 02:34:01,580
I need to know my corners.

3223
02:34:01,580 --> 02:34:02,520
He's over here.

3224
02:34:03,180 --> 02:34:04,400
Bow chicka bow wow.

3225
02:34:06,820 --> 02:34:08,220
Guys, he's over here.

3226
02:34:09,560 --> 02:34:10,640
Mr. Chucky!

3227
02:34:11,720 --> 02:34:12,900
He's to your right.

3228
02:34:13,200 --> 02:34:14,300
He's to your right.

3229
02:34:15,300 --> 02:34:16,040
He's to your left.

3230
02:34:16,080 --> 02:34:16,640
Behind you!

3231
02:34:17,660 --> 02:34:18,560
Behind you!

3232
02:34:23,620 --> 02:34:24,680
Behind you!

3233
02:34:31,580 --> 02:34:32,640
Oh shit!

3234
02:34:38,260 --> 02:34:40,320
It was worth it.

3235
02:34:40,560 --> 02:34:42,700
It was so worth it.

3236
02:34:47,580 --> 02:34:51,400
I think that was 100% worth it, guys.

3237
02:34:52,200 --> 02:34:53,680
It was so...

3238
02:34:53,680 --> 02:34:54,960
...training.

3239
02:34:56,180 --> 02:34:59,300
Bro, I think they're just killing every drone they see.

3240
02:34:59,660 --> 02:35:01,500
He actually was, but...

3241
02:35:01,580 --> 02:35:02,100
...I didn't kill him.

3242
02:35:03,640 --> 02:35:05,140
Look, it's not my fault.

3243
02:35:05,180 --> 02:35:06,500
He didn't listen to my calls.

3244
02:35:07,280 --> 02:35:10,980
I gave him perfectly good callouts, chat.

3245
02:35:12,920 --> 02:35:15,520
I gave him good callouts.

3246
02:35:15,560 --> 02:35:18,100
It's not my fault he didn't listen to it.

3247
02:35:18,540 --> 02:35:20,720
I can't believe that.

3248
02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:23,100
That is on him, sir.

3249
02:35:23,840 --> 02:35:29,720
If he doesn't want to listen to my calls, then he deserved to get killed in there.

3250
02:35:30,020 --> 02:35:30,660
Really?

3251
02:35:31,580 --> 02:35:33,580
Yeah, I know that was the enemy team.

3252
02:35:33,740 --> 02:35:35,160
I knew it was.

3253
02:35:39,320 --> 02:35:41,640
I knew it was the enemy team.

3254
02:35:45,300 --> 02:35:46,260
Oh, man.

3255
02:35:46,560 --> 02:35:47,600
He's right there!

3256
02:35:47,960 --> 02:35:48,600
No, there!

3257
02:35:48,800 --> 02:35:51,040
It's like that one guy that was like, to your left!

3258
02:35:51,180 --> 02:35:52,440
And then he was to my right.

3259
02:35:55,220 --> 02:35:56,440
It was like that one guy.

3260
02:35:56,520 --> 02:35:57,440
That one fucker.

3261
02:35:59,340 --> 02:36:00,980
I'll never forget him.

3262
02:36:01,500 --> 02:36:02,560
To your left!

3263
02:36:05,620 --> 02:36:09,760
Honestly, my favorite moment today was the guy that was like, leave me alone.

3264
02:36:14,600 --> 02:36:16,840
That's my favorite moment today.

3265
02:36:19,360 --> 02:36:20,320
Leave me alone.

3266
02:36:23,400 --> 02:36:25,000
He just doesn't like getting...

3267
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:25,320
Whoa!

3268
02:36:25,600 --> 02:36:27,040
Okay, that was a good shot.

3269
02:36:27,040 --> 02:36:27,380
Whoa!

3270
02:36:27,840 --> 02:36:29,760
That was a really good shot, actually.

3271
02:36:29,960 --> 02:36:31,060
He bleeds again!

3272
02:36:33,780 --> 02:36:35,120
Oh my god!

3273
02:36:35,620 --> 02:36:37,740
He bleeds yet again!

3274
02:36:39,160 --> 02:36:41,280
Thank you for the 10 gifted chips!

3275
02:36:41,620 --> 02:36:41,940
Thank you!

3276
02:36:42,140 --> 02:36:42,760
Thank you!

3277
02:36:43,220 --> 02:36:44,300
Thank you, Paul!

3278
02:36:45,680 --> 02:36:46,240
Okay.

3279
02:36:46,460 --> 02:36:47,120
We're fine.

3280
02:36:49,780 --> 02:36:50,340
Okay.

3281
02:36:51,820 --> 02:36:52,380
Okay.

3282
02:36:52,480 --> 02:36:53,460
Okay, this way.

3283
02:36:53,640 --> 02:36:54,560
I thought it was a dead end.

3284
02:36:54,560 --> 02:36:56,480
I don't know why I thought...

3285
02:36:57,840 --> 02:36:59,600
This way would lead anywhere.

3286
02:37:00,780 --> 02:37:01,420
Okay.

3287
02:37:03,380 --> 02:37:04,020
Oh!

3288
02:37:05,080 --> 02:37:05,720
Woo!

3289
02:37:09,680 --> 02:37:10,920
Oh, I see them.

3290
02:37:11,020 --> 02:37:11,320
What?

3291
02:37:11,480 --> 02:37:12,660
He saw me?

3292
02:37:13,100 --> 02:37:14,740
I didn't even see him!

3293
02:37:15,840 --> 02:37:20,170
What the fuck did I get shot?

3294
02:37:21,270 --> 02:37:23,030
Oh, it's over here.

3295
02:37:23,390 --> 02:37:24,390
Behind you!

3296
02:37:25,650 --> 02:37:26,550
Behind you!

3297
02:37:28,350 --> 02:37:28,870
Behind you!

3298
02:37:30,530 --> 02:37:31,490
To your right!

3299
02:37:31,610 --> 02:37:32,410
To your left!

3300
02:37:40,450 --> 02:37:40,990
Okay.

3301
02:37:46,910 --> 02:37:47,450
Okay.

3302
02:37:49,990 --> 02:37:51,630
I like this game.

3303
02:37:52,930 --> 02:37:53,910
I really...

3304
02:37:53,910 --> 02:37:54,790
I like this game.

3305
02:37:55,950 --> 02:37:57,650
You're too good at this.

3306
02:37:58,050 --> 02:37:59,850
It's not my fault they listened to me.

3307
02:37:59,850 --> 02:38:02,110
You know they didn't have to listen to me.

3308
02:38:05,250 --> 02:38:08,070
It's their fault that they listen.

3309
02:38:10,070 --> 02:38:10,870
Where is.

3310
02:38:11,130 --> 02:38:11,910
Where are you?

3311
02:38:12,790 --> 02:38:13,970
Where are you?

3312
02:38:18,050 --> 02:38:19,550
Where are you?

3313
02:38:19,570 --> 02:38:21,490
I know you're somewhere in here.

3314
02:38:22,330 --> 02:38:24,590
He has to be like camping somewhere.

3315
02:38:25,070 --> 02:38:27,030
I don't see him in the hallways.

3316
02:38:28,590 --> 02:38:32,930
Guys, I'm trying very hard not to crash into anything right now.

3317
02:38:33,030 --> 02:38:34,890
I don't know if that's noticeable.

3318
02:38:36,770 --> 02:38:43,170
After crashing into so many corners, I'm trying so hard not to crash anywhere.

3319
02:38:44,630 --> 02:38:46,750
Wait, I heard gunshots this direction.

3320
02:38:48,810 --> 02:38:49,690
Behind you!

3321
02:38:55,560 --> 02:38:56,620
To your left!

3322
02:39:02,400 --> 02:39:03,060
Behind you!

3323
02:39:06,540 --> 02:39:07,580
To your right, to your right.

3324
02:39:08,100 --> 02:39:09,400
To your left, to your left.

3325
02:39:14,780 --> 02:39:16,780
In the hallways, in the hallways behind you!

3326
02:39:17,280 --> 02:39:18,220
Two, two, two.

3327
02:39:18,300 --> 02:39:19,120
Behind you right now!

3328
02:39:20,420 --> 02:39:20,980
Right there!

3329
02:39:21,220 --> 02:39:21,600
Behind!

3330
02:39:25,400 --> 02:39:27,060
In front of you, in front of you, in front of you!

3331
02:39:29,400 --> 02:39:30,620
Behind you, behind you!

3332
02:39:30,920 --> 02:39:32,080
No!

3333
02:39:32,580 --> 02:39:32,880
No!

3334
02:39:35,700 --> 02:39:38,400
Take it back now, y'all.

3335
02:39:38,740 --> 02:39:41,220
We do a little bit of trolling.

3336
02:39:41,900 --> 02:39:44,220
Oh my god, no!

3337
02:39:45,040 --> 02:39:46,680
We got the kill there.

3338
02:39:47,760 --> 02:39:50,800
I'm gonna miss fuck with my teammate.

3339
02:39:51,540 --> 02:39:52,520
Behind you!

3340
02:39:54,560 --> 02:39:55,920
He doesn't trust me!

3341
02:40:02,360 --> 02:40:03,820
He's like, hey listen!

3342
02:40:06,560 --> 02:40:08,380
A bit of tomfoolery.

3343
02:40:09,220 --> 02:40:11,080
A bit of tomfoolery here.

3344
02:40:12,420 --> 02:40:13,280
Behind you!

3345
02:40:14,640 --> 02:40:16,400
This guy doesn't listen!

3346
02:40:16,700 --> 02:40:17,480
He does!

3347
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:19,840
In front of you!

3348
02:40:20,440 --> 02:40:21,080
Behind!

3349
02:40:23,180 --> 02:40:24,180
He's flanking!

3350
02:40:26,520 --> 02:40:28,680
Look, if you don't listen to me, you're gonna die.

3351
02:40:30,920 --> 02:40:32,560
He's literally flanking right now.

3352
02:40:32,580 --> 02:40:33,460
Right behind you.

3353
02:40:39,720 --> 02:40:41,520
He's just running!

3354
02:40:42,660 --> 02:40:44,760
He's just running away!

3355
02:40:45,440 --> 02:40:47,020
What is he doing?

3356
02:40:52,680 --> 02:40:53,860
He's flanking!

3357
02:40:56,760 --> 02:40:58,440
They learn!

3358
02:40:58,840 --> 02:40:59,960
They learn!

3359
02:41:01,440 --> 02:41:03,060
Get out of my head!

3360
02:41:03,620 --> 02:41:04,620
They're learning.

3361
02:41:04,860 --> 02:41:06,100
They're learning now, guys.

3362
02:41:07,560 --> 02:41:08,920
They're learning, guys.

3363
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:10,940
He's flanking!

3364
02:41:16,440 --> 02:41:18,580
Same exact place, bro!

3365
02:41:18,840 --> 02:41:19,800
Same exact...

3366
02:41:19,800 --> 02:41:21,620
She's in their head!

3367
02:41:23,740 --> 02:41:26,200
They stopped listening to me.

3368
02:41:27,700 --> 02:41:28,840
Oh my god.

3369
02:41:28,920 --> 02:41:29,720
Wait, we did it!

3370
02:41:29,820 --> 02:41:31,280
I told you he was behind you!

3371
02:41:33,920 --> 02:41:33,940
I...

3372
02:41:37,720 --> 02:41:40,720
I did say behind you.

3373
02:41:40,880 --> 02:41:42,740
I did say it!

3374
02:41:46,340 --> 02:41:48,640
I did say it, guys.

3375
02:41:49,780 --> 02:41:51,760
Get out of my head!

3376
02:41:51,900 --> 02:41:52,880
Get out of my head!

3377
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,940
This is worse than dead space.

3378
02:41:57,520 --> 02:41:58,740
It's not my fault.

3379
02:41:58,900 --> 02:42:00,340
I didn't say behind you.

3380
02:42:01,020 --> 02:42:02,980
I gave good intel.

3381
02:42:08,160 --> 02:42:10,160
The clock is right!

3382
02:42:10,240 --> 02:42:10,760
Right now!

3383
02:42:10,760 --> 02:42:11,160
The clock is right twice a day.

3384
02:42:11,280 --> 02:42:11,900
Exactly!

3385
02:42:14,980 --> 02:42:15,660
Yeah.

3386
02:42:16,360 --> 02:42:17,040
Alright.

3387
02:42:17,400 --> 02:42:18,760
It's time to try!

3388
02:42:21,320 --> 02:42:23,980
This game needs a drone racing.

3389
02:42:24,540 --> 02:42:25,440
No we...

3390
02:42:29,100 --> 02:42:33,000
Okay, what all I need all we need is one shot.

3391
02:42:35,840 --> 02:42:37,280
Wait was that teammate?

3392
02:42:38,260 --> 02:42:38,860
Oops.

3393
02:42:42,340 --> 02:42:42,940
Oopsie.

3394
02:42:45,380 --> 02:42:47,180
Oopsie, that was a teammate.

3395
02:42:55,820 --> 02:42:56,780
My bad.

3396
02:42:57,660 --> 02:42:59,020
Oh, I almost shot Allen.

3397
02:43:07,740 --> 02:43:09,200
Hey, I got the kill!

3398
02:43:09,420 --> 02:43:10,180
I got it back!

3399
02:43:10,680 --> 02:43:12,980
Guys, I got back the kill!

3400
02:43:15,020 --> 02:43:15,700
It's okay.

3401
02:43:16,140 --> 02:43:16,820
Equivalent exchange.

3402
02:43:17,060 --> 02:43:17,840
I got a kill.

3403
02:43:18,260 --> 02:43:19,300
Guys, it's okay.

3404
02:43:19,400 --> 02:43:19,940
I got the kill.

3405
02:43:19,940 --> 02:43:19,960
I got the kill.

3406
02:43:19,960 --> 02:43:20,060
I got the kill.

3407
02:43:20,420 --> 02:43:22,100
We got a kill back chat.

3408
02:43:22,460 --> 02:43:24,200
No, we did our part.

3409
02:43:26,700 --> 02:43:28,280
Justice for James.

3410
02:43:29,040 --> 02:43:32,080
Guys, I took a life and I gave a life.

3411
02:43:33,920 --> 02:43:35,480
There you go, equivalent exchange.

3412
02:43:37,040 --> 02:43:40,440
Equivalent exchange chat!

3413
02:43:42,400 --> 02:43:43,000
Okay.

3414
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:44,160
How many people died?

3415
02:43:44,580 --> 02:43:47,320
I wish it tells you like who's dead and who's alive.

3416
02:43:48,060 --> 02:43:49,520
I wish it tells you that.

3417
02:43:52,260 --> 02:43:54,140
No, no, no, no, no.

3418
02:43:54,380 --> 02:43:55,460
No, I used...

3419
02:43:55,460 --> 02:43:56,540
It's a life gun.

3420
02:43:57,280 --> 02:43:58,540
Oh, last guy.

3421
02:43:59,840 --> 02:44:00,380
Okay.

3422
02:44:01,040 --> 02:44:01,580
Woah!

3423
02:44:03,860 --> 02:44:05,600
Guys, they knew my plan.

3424
02:44:05,820 --> 02:44:08,100
I was gonna lead somebody over to him.

3425
02:44:08,280 --> 02:44:09,140
I was gonna...

3426
02:44:09,140 --> 02:44:11,540
How did they know?

3427
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,540
I was gonna lead somebody to him.

3428
02:44:14,940 --> 02:44:15,480
No!

3429
02:44:15,560 --> 02:44:16,720
They ruined my plan!

3430
02:44:22,830 --> 02:44:23,730
How did they know?

3431
02:44:24,490 --> 02:44:27,090
How did they know it was gonna take their life?

3432
02:44:27,790 --> 02:44:30,050
They just wised up to me.

3433
02:44:30,870 --> 02:44:32,570
I can't believe it!

3434
02:44:39,960 --> 02:44:41,360
The fucking drone.

3435
02:44:43,640 --> 02:44:45,280
The drone flashlight.

3436
02:44:46,960 --> 02:44:52,260
The plan was to find the enemy team and be like, follow me!

3437
02:44:52,260 --> 02:44:57,500
And then take him to this... to this... to their last teammate.

3438
02:44:58,780 --> 02:45:04,240
There's such a nuisance.

3439
02:45:04,360 --> 02:45:05,480
I love it.

3440
02:45:06,900 --> 02:45:08,200
Emu, what happened?

3441
02:45:08,320 --> 02:45:09,600
You fell off, bro.

3442
02:45:11,040 --> 02:45:13,260
Emu, what happened to you?

3443
02:45:14,050 --> 02:45:15,340
Wait, we have another?

3444
02:45:17,130 --> 02:45:19,960
Wait, we have two players still alive?

3445
02:45:20,920 --> 02:45:22,080
Oh shit.

3446
02:45:24,260 --> 02:45:26,860
I didn't realize... sorry, I didn't realize you were alive.

3447
02:45:35,810 --> 02:45:36,830
Emu, what happened?

3448
02:45:36,930 --> 02:45:37,170
Emu!

3449
02:45:38,350 --> 02:45:40,090
You used to be a god!

3450
02:45:40,410 --> 02:45:41,750
What happened to you?

3451
02:45:44,250 --> 02:45:46,030
People used to worship you.

3452
02:45:46,090 --> 02:45:48,030
People used to be afraid of you.

3453
02:45:50,170 --> 02:45:51,450
Liam, thank you for the super chat.

3454
02:45:51,530 --> 02:45:52,290
Thank you, thank you.

3455
02:45:52,590 --> 02:45:54,670
You know, there's a term for having too much...

3456
02:45:54,670 --> 02:45:55,090
Whoa!

3457
02:45:55,910 --> 02:45:57,430
Liam, thank you for the super chat.

3458
02:45:57,550 --> 02:45:58,370
Thank you, thank you.

3459
02:46:01,970 --> 02:46:02,550
Liam!

3460
02:46:03,970 --> 02:46:07,830
Ever since we found out you could bleed, it's all downhill.

3461
02:46:09,070 --> 02:46:11,270
You peaked ten rounds ago.

3462
02:46:13,690 --> 02:46:14,270
Liam!

3463
02:46:18,030 --> 02:46:19,190
Or, Emu!

3464
02:46:22,490 --> 02:46:23,730
Hey, what are they doing?

3465
02:46:23,890 --> 02:46:25,130
Why are they just both there?

3466
02:46:25,250 --> 02:46:28,610
They're just like, maybe he's in that corner.

3467
02:46:29,290 --> 02:46:30,150
Just run around!

3468
02:46:30,450 --> 02:46:31,570
What's the worst that could happen?

3469
02:46:34,790 --> 02:46:36,110
Yeah, they lost their fear.

3470
02:46:37,590 --> 02:46:39,030
Ever since we found out.

3471
02:46:40,250 --> 02:46:40,870
Beat him!

3472
02:46:42,450 --> 02:46:44,070
Wait, there's... oh shit!

3473
02:46:44,330 --> 02:46:45,490
What the fuck?

3474
02:46:45,910 --> 02:46:46,790
Did we win?

3475
02:46:48,770 --> 02:46:50,910
Wait, he wins the point?

3476
02:46:50,990 --> 02:46:52,290
Oh my god, it's Emu.

3477
02:46:53,470 --> 02:46:55,250
How did they win the point?

3478
02:46:59,380 --> 02:47:00,320
I'm running in.

3479
02:47:00,780 --> 02:47:01,820
I'm running in.

3480
02:47:02,500 --> 02:47:03,340
This is it.

3481
02:47:04,720 --> 02:47:05,800
I'm running in.

3482
02:47:06,420 --> 02:47:07,860
They won't expect me.

3483
02:47:08,760 --> 02:47:10,540
They won't expect me at all.

3484
02:47:11,280 --> 02:47:12,560
I'm gonna run in.

3485
02:47:13,780 --> 02:47:15,300
What are they gonna do?

3486
02:47:15,340 --> 02:47:16,040
Shoot me back?

3487
02:47:20,960 --> 02:47:22,140
Not if I... oh.

3488
02:47:23,800 --> 02:47:24,480
Guys.

3489
02:47:25,680 --> 02:47:27,700
They shot me back, guys.

3490
02:47:28,080 --> 02:47:28,760
They...

3491
02:47:30,820 --> 02:47:31,500
Yes.

3492
02:47:32,840 --> 02:47:35,660
They... they shot me back, guys.

3493
02:47:36,360 --> 02:47:39,500
Who would've thought they could do that?

3494
02:47:40,580 --> 02:47:41,840
Hey, I know where they are.

3495
02:47:41,900 --> 02:47:42,380
Follow me.

3496
02:47:42,640 --> 02:47:43,060
Oh.

3497
02:47:43,400 --> 02:47:43,800
Oh.

3498
02:47:43,940 --> 02:47:44,400
Oh.

3499
02:47:45,520 --> 02:47:46,200
Oh.

3500
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:47,080
Oh.

3501
02:47:51,240 --> 02:47:53,760
Guys, he didn't wanna follow me.

3502
02:47:58,260 --> 02:47:59,120
Two bears.

3503
02:47:59,280 --> 02:48:00,260
Thank you for the super chat.

3504
02:48:00,360 --> 02:48:00,600
Thank you.

3505
02:48:00,680 --> 02:48:01,160
Thank you.

3506
02:48:01,280 --> 02:48:03,840
Whoa, real life looks so... real.

3507
02:48:04,180 --> 02:48:05,520
Thank you for the super chat.

3508
02:48:05,600 --> 02:48:05,940
Thank you.

3509
02:48:05,960 --> 02:48:06,600
Thank you.

3510
02:48:06,800 --> 02:48:08,120
I don't understand.

3511
02:48:08,900 --> 02:48:11,080
Why did they wanna follow me?

3512
02:48:11,400 --> 02:48:12,980
I could've led them.

3513
02:48:15,040 --> 02:48:16,560
They had enough.

3514
02:48:16,800 --> 02:48:17,540
He didn't...

3515
02:48:17,540 --> 02:48:19,100
They didn't wanna win.

3516
02:48:22,740 --> 02:48:23,800
It's like...

3517
02:48:23,800 --> 02:48:28,140
I don't know why they think that I was gonna lead them to their deaths or something.

3518
02:48:28,500 --> 02:48:29,880
I don't know where they got that impression.

3519
02:48:30,660 --> 02:48:32,700
Cried a little too much.

3520
02:48:37,640 --> 02:48:39,180
You're so ungrateful.

3521
02:48:41,440 --> 02:48:43,040
I can't believe it.

3522
02:48:44,380 --> 02:48:46,300
How can you be so ungrateful?

3523
02:48:50,220 --> 02:48:51,160
Trust issues.

3524
02:48:54,080 --> 02:48:55,060
Oh my god.

3525
02:48:55,820 --> 02:48:56,700
Clutch or kick.

3526
02:48:56,920 --> 02:48:57,600
Clutch or kick.

3527
02:49:01,080 --> 02:49:02,120
Clutch or kick!

3528
02:49:05,200 --> 02:49:05,760
Whoa.

3529
02:49:08,480 --> 02:49:09,980
Wait, how many people are still alive?

3530
02:49:10,520 --> 02:49:11,080
Okay.

3531
02:49:11,980 --> 02:49:13,080
One... one guy.

3532
02:49:14,160 --> 02:49:15,100
Just him.

3533
02:49:15,280 --> 02:49:15,640
Whoa!

3534
02:49:16,020 --> 02:49:16,300
Whoa!

3535
02:49:16,300 --> 02:49:19,000
It doesn't even matter if they're teammates.

3536
02:49:19,480 --> 02:49:20,820
He fucking was like, no.

3537
02:49:22,440 --> 02:49:25,380
That was like our own teammates' drone.

3538
02:49:28,920 --> 02:49:31,960
We have one guy that literally has 20 kills.

3539
02:49:32,700 --> 02:49:33,540
He's a...

3540
02:49:34,620 --> 02:49:40,980
We only discovered that he's not invincible just like five rounds ago.

3541
02:49:44,500 --> 02:49:46,960
It's been no fun allowed.

3542
02:49:49,780 --> 02:49:52,320
Bro is paranoid as hell now.

3543
02:49:52,560 --> 02:49:54,480
I don't think he realized I'm already dead.

3544
02:49:54,860 --> 02:49:55,640
I don't think he...

3545
02:49:55,640 --> 02:49:58,260
He thinks every drone is me.

3546
02:49:58,600 --> 02:49:59,840
He doesn't know.

3547
02:50:01,860 --> 02:50:04,360
Oh, but he won't shoot the red drones?

3548
02:50:05,100 --> 02:50:05,920
Oh, okay.

3549
02:50:05,980 --> 02:50:06,360
Never mind.

3550
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,080
He got baited.

3551
02:50:10,080 --> 02:50:12,560
He got baited so hard.

3552
02:50:15,280 --> 02:50:16,620
Oh my God.

3553
02:50:18,020 --> 02:50:18,820
Holy shit.

3554
02:50:19,560 --> 02:50:20,620
Guy got baited.

3555
02:50:20,660 --> 02:50:20,840
Yeah!

3556
02:50:21,120 --> 02:50:23,080
175 rank points!

3557
02:50:23,200 --> 02:50:23,780
Let's go!

3558
02:50:25,500 --> 02:50:25,900
Alright.

3559
02:50:26,020 --> 02:50:26,840
That was really fun.

3560
02:50:26,960 --> 02:50:27,760
I'm gonna call it here.

3561
02:50:29,280 --> 02:50:30,080
Holy shit.

3562
02:50:30,200 --> 02:50:31,440
I didn't expect to play.

3563
02:50:31,700 --> 02:50:33,640
I didn't think I was gonna play this game for three hours.

3564
02:50:33,740 --> 02:50:36,000
Because when I played the first game, I was like, ooh, I don't know.

3565
02:50:36,180 --> 02:50:38,840
This feels like a quick, like, two hours.

3566
02:50:38,840 --> 02:50:39,560
And then...

3567
02:50:39,560 --> 02:50:41,160
And then maybe we're done.

3568
02:50:41,340 --> 02:50:42,360
But then, like, I don't know.

3569
02:50:42,360 --> 02:50:43,260
I got actually...

3570
02:50:44,960 --> 02:50:47,840
I started enjoying it more and more the more I learned the game.

3571
02:50:48,100 --> 02:50:51,920
And then, like, learned how, like, that you can, like, troll people as drones and stuff.

3572
02:50:52,180 --> 02:50:53,680
And so it got, like, more and more...

3573
02:50:53,680 --> 02:50:56,100
It definitely got more fun as we played.

3574
02:50:56,440 --> 02:50:58,300
So, I'm glad that, like...

3575
02:50:58,300 --> 02:50:59,880
I got that, like, I...

3576
02:50:59,880 --> 02:51:01,680
And I improved a lot, too!

3577
02:51:01,860 --> 02:51:03,700
I improved a lot playing the game.

3578
02:51:03,980 --> 02:51:06,360
I think I trolled a bit too much at the end, though.

3579
02:51:06,580 --> 02:51:07,780
I decided...

3580
02:51:07,780 --> 02:51:10,860
I started trolling too much at the end.

3581
02:51:11,620 --> 02:51:12,840
Oh, Alan, thank you for the super chat.

3582
02:51:12,920 --> 02:51:13,680
Thank you, thank you.

3583
02:51:13,760 --> 02:51:15,260
Rest in peace, my refunds.

3584
02:51:15,360 --> 02:51:15,900
GG's, doki.

3585
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:16,700
Thank you for the super chat.

3586
02:51:16,720 --> 02:51:17,380
Thank you, thank you.

3587
02:51:17,440 --> 02:51:17,600
Yeah!

3588
02:51:17,860 --> 02:51:20,160
I think it's for those who actually enjoy tactical shooters.

3589
02:51:20,600 --> 02:51:21,400
Because it is...

3590
02:51:21,400 --> 02:51:23,360
It is fun for a tactical shooter.

3591
02:51:23,980 --> 02:51:26,140
And, like, you know, I'm not a tactical shooter type of person.

3592
02:51:26,180 --> 02:51:27,080
But I did enjoy myself.

3593
02:51:27,300 --> 02:51:29,320
Especially, like, just messing around with the drones and stuff.

3594
02:51:29,480 --> 02:51:32,200
I think it's, like, fun in a way where...

3595
02:51:32,200 --> 02:51:33,900
When you're playing with friends type deal.

3596
02:51:34,180 --> 02:51:36,040
Definitely, like, when you're playing with friends and stuff.

3597
02:51:36,280 --> 02:51:36,620
But, yeah!

3598
02:51:36,620 --> 02:51:37,520
Anyway...

3599
02:51:37,520 --> 02:51:38,800
I'm tired.

3600
02:51:40,920 --> 02:51:42,980
Sorry for no post-chatting.

3601
02:51:43,640 --> 02:51:45,920
There's so much work to do behind the scenes.

3602
02:51:46,240 --> 02:51:47,900
But we'll have chatting stream...

3603
02:51:47,900 --> 02:51:50,140
We'll have post-stream chats again soon.

3604
02:51:50,740 --> 02:51:53,040
We just have a lot of stuff to do behind the scenes.

3605
02:51:53,080 --> 02:51:53,920
Almost every day.

3606
02:51:54,160 --> 02:51:56,640
So, I have to cut it short here, guys.

3607
02:51:56,800 --> 02:51:58,600
But I hope you had fun watching.

3608
02:51:58,840 --> 02:52:01,220
As always, everybody stay hydrated.

3609
02:52:01,720 --> 02:52:02,400
Poster check.

3610
02:52:02,600 --> 02:52:03,960
Get up and walk...

3611
02:52:03,960 --> 02:52:04,760
Get up and move around.

3612
02:52:04,840 --> 02:52:05,820
Sorry, I was like, whoa.

3613
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:06,420
Walk.

3614
02:52:06,620 --> 02:52:07,240
Get up and move around.

3615
02:52:07,280 --> 02:52:08,120
Get that blood flowing.

3616
02:52:08,220 --> 02:52:09,940
And if you stay up for me...

3617
02:52:09,940 --> 02:52:10,700
Head to bed.

3618
02:52:10,940 --> 02:52:12,180
Because you deserve it.

3619
02:52:12,300 --> 02:52:13,340
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3620
02:52:13,860 --> 02:52:14,560
Bye, guys.

3621
02:52:15,540 --> 02:52:15,940
Bye.

3622
02:52:16,040 --> 02:52:16,440
Bye.

3623
02:52:16,500 --> 02:52:16,900
Bye.
