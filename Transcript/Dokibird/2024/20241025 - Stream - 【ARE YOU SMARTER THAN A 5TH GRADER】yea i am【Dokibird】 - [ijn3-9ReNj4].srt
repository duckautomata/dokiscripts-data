1
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,930
Hello everybody, hello, hello.

2
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,350
Guys, I... I'm okay.

3
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:04,410
After last night, I am fine.

4
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:12,990
I know the waiting room was out very late, like maybe like three hours before the stream started.

5
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,930
But like, I went to bed.

6
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,510
That's... I don't have an excuse.

7
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,350
I literally just... I went to bed.

8
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,830
Guys, I was just really tired, okay?

9
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,550
Yesterday was...

10
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,710
It was an experience and I went to bed.

11
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,350
Also, okay, so the VOD's still alive.

12
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,010
Update!

13
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,630
The VOD is surprisingly still alive.

14
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:52,050
Um, and you're asking and uh... So um, I went to bed, so I didn't edit the VOD right away.

15
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:58,570
So I was like, if I wake up, two things is gonna... are gonna... is gonna happen.

16
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:05,410
Either the stream gets demonetized or my channel's gone.

17
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,150
So I was like, all right, let's go gambling.

18
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:23,450
Because, you know, I could have just stayed up and waited until the video process and then edit... edit the stuff out, like, you know, on the day, but I was tired.

19
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:27,090
So I was like, all right, let's go gambling.

20
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,390
So I was like, I like my odds.

21
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,970
If my channel disappears, you know what?

22
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,950
It's... it was the right time to retire at that... at that point.

23
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,050
That... that's my peak.

24
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,530
You know how you're like, retire at your peak?

25
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,490
I was like, you know what?

26
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:51,210
If anything, if that's gonna be my peak, I'm fine with that.

27
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,430
I'm... I'm like, fine.

28
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,450
So... so... so I was like, all right.

29
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:05,850
Now, what I didn't realize was there was a hidden third secret option.

30
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:10,430
And that was basically... nothing happened.

31
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,130
What do you mean by nothing happened, Doki?

32
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,330
The VOD was not demonetized!

33
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:25,530
And it did not get age-restricted.

34
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:32,670
Not only did it not get demonetized, it didn't even get age-restricted.

35
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,830
So I was like, oh, okay, thank God.

36
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,110
Anyway, um...

37
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,330
I'm not gonna push my luck.

38
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,830
So I woke up, I edited the VOD.

39
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,370
So like, I blurred out, you know, I blurred out the parts that...

40
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,490
You know, might not be very friendly.

41
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:58,430
Might not be something that should be on an un-age-restricted VOD.

42
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,530
So I did blur it, but it takes a while to process.

43
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,950
So chat is still alive.

44
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:07,930
But...

45
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:12,630
Today... today will be the last day chat's gonna be alive.

46
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,970
So... so...

47
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:29,250
If you want to see live chat, if you want to see people's reaction with the live chat, today is literally the last day it's gonna be alive before the chat's gone forever.

48
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,310
I mean, the chat's technically on the screen.

49
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,890
But like, you know what I mean?

50
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:40,450
Like, the live chat on the side, because whenever you edit a VOD, whenever you edit the VOD, the chat disappears.

51
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:47,670
And today's the... today will be the last day you have it will have the live chat.

52
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,190
Because after that, it's like sayonara.

53
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,170
After that, it's just goodbye forever.

54
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:00,630
But yeah, that's some... some fun news.

55
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:09,810
I'm just... I'm equally as surprised as all of you guys that...

56
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,290
It survived, because...

57
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:13,590
Whoa.

58
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,850
Gordon, thank you for the Akasupa!

59
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,330
Thank you, thank you!

60
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:26,210
I made a bet yesterday that the VOD would get taken down, yet it still stands.

61
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,270
Undemonetized, no age restricting.

62
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,630
I am a man of my word.

63
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,010
Thank you for the Akasupa.

64
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,470
Thank you, thank you.

65
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,650
Wait, Fumbati, you're still mine!

66
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,290
Fucking, you should have shown your face.

67
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,730
That was a birthday present.

68
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,430
It's not your birthday anymore.

69
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:49,590
Anyway.

70
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,870
Oh, is the live chat gone for real?

71
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:52,670
Okay, then.

72
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:53,690
Sorry, guys.

73
00:06:54,270 --> 00:07:00,190
If the live chat is now gone for... is now gone on the VOD, you were too late.

74
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,830
I warned you guys too late.

75
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,450
It's gone.

76
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,630
But at least the video...

77
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,510
The video is saved now.

78
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,750
The video has now been saved.

79
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,590
All right, all right.

80
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,310
Today...

81
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,750
So today...

82
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:24,450
Since yesterday, I showed you guys how good I am with the ladies.

83
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,070
And technically, you guys can...

84
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,150
Okay, but like...

85
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,270
Guys, it's not about the journey.

86
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,590
The journey.

87
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,350
It's about the end game.

88
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:36,150
And I did get the lady in the end.

89
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:41,470
So since yesterday, I showed you guys how good I am with the ladies.

90
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:46,990
Today, I'm gonna show you guys that I'm actually smarter than a child.

91
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:58,270
That I'm a fucking genius by showing you guys how much smarter I am than a fucking 10-year-old.

92
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,070
So I am here.

93
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,310
What do you mean redemption arc?

94
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,310
Yesterday, I got with a woman.

95
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:07,870
Not only...

96
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,350
Not only is she not just a girl.

97
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,290
She was a woman.

98
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,870
So I made it.

99
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:20,010
It's about the end game.

100
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,030
You cried when you saw her.

101
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,850
Anybody would!

102
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,790
They were D-cups.

103
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,550
I mean, you would too.

104
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,210
Jake, thank you for the super chat.

105
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,270
Thank you, thank you.

106
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,050
Hi, Doki.

107
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,150
It's my birthday today.

108
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,550
Thank you for always making the day with better streams.

109
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:42,510
Thank you for the super chat.

110
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,510
Thank you, thank you.

111
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,730
Also, Marcy, it's my birthday on Sunday.

112
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,730
So take my money.

113
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,870
Thank you for the super chat.

114
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:48,510
Thank you, thank you.

115
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,130
Oh my god.

116
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,630
A double birthday song?

117
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,290
Happy birthday to you.

118
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,950
Happy birthday to you.

119
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,970
Happy birthday, dear Jake and Marcy.

120
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,650
Happy birthday to you.

121
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:58,070
Yeah!

122
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,590
Happy birthday, guys!

123
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,490
All right.

124
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,290
Awesome day!

125
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,010
Thank you for the gifted ship.

126
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:04,950
Thank you, thank you.

127
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,350
All right, today's the day.

128
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,670
Today's the day you will stop laughing at me for being dumb.

129
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:14,510
Because now you'll know that I'm smarter than a goddamn 10-year-old.

130
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,830
Today's that day.

131
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:19,790
All right, let's...

132
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,730
Oh my god, what the fuck?

133
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,790
Okay, give me a sec.

134
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,910
What the fuck was the stream deck shit that just popped out on my fucking screen?

135
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,790
I was like, it's time to update your stream deck.

136
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:33,690
And I'm like, what?

137
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,650
I don't even have stream deck plugged in.

138
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,330
All right, let's see.

139
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,250
I've never played...

140
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,190
I've actually never watched this show before.

141
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,090
So like, this is like also my...

142
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,510
There's a...

143
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,490
Oh my god, I forgot the game.

144
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,670
I had to resize the game because...

145
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,870
I had to resize this because of HuniePop.

146
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,930
There's a lot of firsts for this week.

147
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,990
Never played or watched HuniePop gameplay.

148
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:05,010
Never watched are you smarter than a fifth grader.

149
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,930
I just know it's like...

150
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,070
All right, US-based...

151
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:08,730
You know what?

152
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,890
I went to a United States international school.

153
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,790
It's almost the same thing.

154
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,590
Can't be that bad.

155
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,010
All right, what's classmate?

156
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,270
Permanent record?

157
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,530
School desk?

158
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:23,850
What's this?

159
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,770
Oh, standard gamer.

160
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:32,210
Oh, with the mom, dad, fussy baby.

161
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:33,890
Okay.

162
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,750
All right, let's see.

163
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,290
Um, I want to change...

164
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,270
Oh, I can change my...

165
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,110
I can add stuff to my desk.

166
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,650
Oh, that's so cool.

167
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,550
I get to be like full customization.

168
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,650
All right, wow.

169
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,110
Wow-wee.

170
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,830
And then I'm gonna have...

171
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:53,390
Let's see.

172
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:54,850
We should have...

173
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:55,210
Okay, yeah.

174
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,950
I think we should have that.

175
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:04,190
And then we should also add this so people would know that I'm gonna become a lawyer when I grow up.

176
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,210
All right, here we go.

177
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,010
And then icon.

178
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,130
We're going for an icon.

179
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,930
Guys, this is very important.

180
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,110
Before we go in, we gotta have like...

181
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,030
We gotta have like the drip, you know?

182
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,090
We gotta have like...

183
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:20,310
People know that how smart I am by just looking at my desk.

184
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,130
Like the AI.

185
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:26,570
I need the NPCs to register in the algorithm that I am serious.

186
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,470
All right, let's get the telescope.

187
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,550
I mean the microscope.

188
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:36,990
Let's get the microscope, guys.

189
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,890
All right, aquatic aerial.

190
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,250
Okay, quantum gamer.

191
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,090
Oh, wait.

192
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,630
Nuclear gamer.

193
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,430
There we go.

194
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:48,430
Great start.

195
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:48,950
No!

196
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,680
All right, I remember what it looked like, guys.

197
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,620
Don't worry.

198
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,080
There we go.

199
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,200
Was it this?

200
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,960
Yeah, I wanted to be a lawyer.

201
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,560
I remember.

202
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,800
All right, here we go.

203
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,960
Everything's good.

204
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,360
Um, Potato.

205
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,880
Thank you for the 10 gifted ships.

206
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,220
Thank you.

207
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:11,840
Thank you.

208
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,220
Liam, thank you for the super chat.

209
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:13,560
Thank you.

210
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,260
Thank you, Doki.

211
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,520
The whole point of the game is that you play a loser who needs a fairy to use her magic powers in order to get them a day.

212
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,380
No, no, no!

213
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,640
I didn't use...

214
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,920
The only magic power I used from a fairy that doesn't exist, by the way.

215
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,920
It's all in my head, because I didn't take my meds.

216
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:32,600
Is her stalker, like, her stalker ray.

217
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,360
So, like, that was the only help I got.

218
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:40,560
Other than that, everything else was me, all natural, Riz, right there.

219
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,620
And I got a lady in the end.

220
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,540
Within three hours of meeting her, we went to bed.

221
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,820
And, like, it was a little scary.

222
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,440
But, like, we got to the end.

223
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,760
Just a little scary.

224
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,860
But, we made it.

225
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,120
We made it to the goal.

226
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,540
So, that's all that matters.

227
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,380
Oh, am I...

228
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,000
Is this me?

229
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,980
I thought I was an adult.

230
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,980
I thought I was an adult.

231
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,240
Oh, no, it's just...

232
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,060
Oh, it's the kids.

233
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,720
I'm fighting.

234
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:15,860
Okay.

235
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,540
Oh, my God, who is this fucking nerd?

236
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,160
Oh, no, he's not even an all-rounder.

237
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,580
He's just really good at math.

238
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,560
Like, he has a D in humanities?

239
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,220
How do you have a D plus in humanities?

240
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,520
It's like his...

241
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,220
Oh, like, it's almost like history.

242
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,320
Wait, I don't remember what you learn in humanities.

243
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,060
Not gonna lie.

244
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,080
I'm fighting children.

245
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,100
Yes, because they're fifth graders.

246
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,140
All right.

247
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:45,880
We're fine.

248
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,420
These...

249
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,480
I looked at their stats.

250
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:47,960
They're...

251
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,880
They're so bad.

252
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,060
All right, exam mode.

253
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,140
All right, they're a nuclear gamer.

254
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,760
I bring up the game a little bit.

255
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,980
Don't worry, I got you.

256
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,340
All right.

257
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,900
I brought it up.

258
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:04,640
Hey, Teddy.

259
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,620
Wait, your name is Theodore?

260
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,640
Two hosts?

261
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,060
They're sixth grade?!

262
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,420
Are you smarter than a sixth grader?

263
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,700
I thought fifth grade was the limit!

264
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,540
Where the fuck did sixth grade come...

265
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,420
That's different.

266
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,880
That's middle school.

267
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,440
That's a whole new territory.

268
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,040
Chat is not cheating, by the way.

269
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,800
Chat, six is one more than five.

270
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,560
Exactly!

271
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,540
No cheats, no classmate.

272
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,600
Let's see if you can prove that you really are smarter than a fifth grader.

273
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,720
That's actually so fucked up!

274
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,060
Oh, turn it up even more.

275
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:54,820
Don't worry, I got you.

276
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,920
Wait, maybe if there's...

277
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,660
I forgot to look at the most important part like this.

278
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,720
Maybe I'm gonna turn down the music and effects.

279
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,080
Yeah, the music and effects are so loud.

280
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,560
All right, that should be fine.

281
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,280
And it'll turn up the game a little bit more.

282
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,220
All right.

283
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,340
Okay, first grade.

284
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,680
That's like addition problems.

285
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,460
We'll get the math out of the way.

286
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,320
Who is it?

287
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,720
I don't remember who was good at math.

288
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,740
Is Hayley good at math?

289
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,800
Are you good at math?

290
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,260
It's literally first grade.

291
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,060
How can you fuck up math, Hayley?

292
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,980
That's not math!

293
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,080
She's not doing math!

294
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:38,860
Teddy!

295
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,140
You know what?

296
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,620
I'm gonna test you in math.

297
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,960
I know it's not in your category, but like it's the first grade.

298
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,880
We're gonna get the math part out of the way.

299
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,280
Hayley, we're gonna get the math part out of the way now.

300
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,210
So like...

301
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:01,840
So like, I know like math is not your strongest, but it's first grade.

302
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,160
There's no way you could fuck up first grade math.

303
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,980
Like it's literally like additions and subtractions in first grade.

304
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:16,020
Maybe a little bit of multiplication and division, but like we need a math out now.

305
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,140
All right.

306
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,980
How bad can it be?

307
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,140
I...

308
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:28,500
What?

309
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,020
What the fuck is a whole number?

310
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,560
Two?

311
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,120
What?

312
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,260
What's a...

313
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,460
What's a whole number?

314
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,980
Is that a number when it's...

315
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,040
When it's full?

316
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,960
It's two, right?

317
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,180
I did not learn this at first.

318
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,940
What the fuck is a whole number?

319
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,200
Like it's a number that's full, right?

320
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,580
Okay, is that the opposite of prime numbers?

321
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,360
Is that it?

322
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,180
Is it the opposite of prime?

323
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,380
Fuck off, Hayley!

324
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:10,700
You don't...

325
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,820
Hayley, no, you...

326
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,460
Okay, no.

327
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,460
Hayley, you go in.

328
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,200
Hayley, you come in.

329
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,380
I need somebody to explain what whole numbers are.

330
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,480
All right.

331
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,620
Okay, cheat.

332
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,520
New question.

333
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,760
Ask the class.

334
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,600
What's copy?

335
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,640
Am I copying her homework?

336
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,760
All right, what's your homework, Hayley?

337
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,060
All right, Hayley, don't fuck this up.

338
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,360
It's first grade and you're a fifth grader.

339
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:44,960
If you can't even figure out what a whole number is, then...

340
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,220
Then you're as fucked as me.

341
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:52,020
But it's even worse for you because it's been like a lot of years since first grade.

342
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,560
I wanted to pick two.

343
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,020
Hayley.

344
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,340
Hayley, I...

345
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,720
Hayley!

346
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,300
I was gonna pick two.

347
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,620
But I didn't believe in myself.

348
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,780
That's not even my fault!

349
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,560
I was gonna pick two because I was like...

350
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,560
A whole number has to be like...

351
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,980
A number that's a full number, right?

352
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,480
Because it's whole...

353
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,080
I failed?

354
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,620
I...

355
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,800
This is the first grade...

356
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,260
This is Hayley's fault.

357
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,580
Oh my gosh.

358
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,740
Fuck Hayley.

359
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,920
Oh my god.

360
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,300
I was not confident in myself because you guys were all judging me.

361
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,440
You were all judging me.

362
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,060
I wasn't confident.

363
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,240
I didn't even let you insta-fail.

364
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:04,760
That's...

365
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,420
That's a practice round, guys.

366
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,820
Guys, this was a practice round chat.

367
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,900
It doesn't mean anything.

368
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,860
It's a practice round.

369
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Now, it's the real game.

370
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,780
It's the real fucking game.

371
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,000
Alright.

372
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,400
I'm gonna...

373
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,380
Spelling can't be that bad.

374
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,500
It's literally...

375
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,740
You're just spelling a word.

376
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,140
You're spelling a word.

377
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,900
I'm getting the harder subjects out of the way.

378
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:44,480
How many times does the letter A appear in the name of the following state?

379
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:46,940
Alabama.

380
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,180
Alabama.

381
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:55,500
A-L-A-B-A-M-A...

382
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:55,740
Four.

383
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:56,460
Four.

384
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,720
I counted on my fingers.

385
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,240
It's three.

386
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,820
Final answer, Teddy.

387
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,520
It's three.

388
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,300
Wait.

389
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:09,580
A-L-A-B-A-M-A...

390
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,360
It's four.

391
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,580
It's four.

392
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,920
It's four.

393
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,580
It's four.

394
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,220
It's four.

395
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,300
Why are you saying...

396
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,960
Guys, you're fucking me up.

397
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,580
It's four.

398
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,780
Like, A...

399
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,000
Okay.

400
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:29,560
A-L-A-B-A-M-A...

401
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,620
It's four.

402
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,540
Three is four.

403
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,220
So, the answer is...

404
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,420
Four.

405
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,140
Thank God.

406
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,040
You guys are fucking me up.

407
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,860
I see three.

408
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,700
I thought you meant, like, there's three A's.

409
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,740
And I was like, there's no way there's three A's in Alabama.

410
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,280
But you didn't even help.

411
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,460
Shit, Ellie.

412
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,700
I used my fingers.

413
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,560
Oh my God.

414
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,160
I don't care.

415
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,660
When would I get to show my channel?

416
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,180
Subscribe to me at DokiBrit at YouTube.

417
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,640
Lord, gross.

418
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,020
I still have Ellie?

419
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,780
Dumb is cute.

420
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:14,180
My oshi is just spiriting to just show us how cute she is.

421
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,160
Thank you for the akasu.

422
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,680
You know what?

423
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,460
Social studies, Ellie.

424
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,760
Come in here.

425
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,900
I know you're smart.

426
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,960
You got glasses on, just like me.

427
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,520
The fuck?

428
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:30,980
Winter?

429
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,920
It's winter.

430
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,580
Yeah.

431
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,480
It's December, January.

432
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,440
That has to be...

433
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,400
What kind of...

434
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,360
What kind of question is this?

435
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,720
It has to be winter.

436
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,260
Like, how could you fuck this up?

437
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,400
Why would it be summer?

438
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,120
How could January, December be...

439
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,160
Oh my God, thank God.

440
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,980
Ellie, stop cheering.

441
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,420
If I...

442
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,740
I wish I could see what his answer was.

443
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,820
I...

444
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,340
A first grade question?

445
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,560
We had one...

446
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,500
It asked me what a whole number is.

447
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,580
What the fuck is a whole number?

448
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,960
Yeah, second grade!

449
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:18,800
Let's go!

450
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,980
We upgraded!

451
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,460
Guys, we got promoted.

452
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,700
We skipped a grade.

453
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,240
We skipped the grade chat.

454
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,280
It's over for him.

455
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:34,820
Oh...

456
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,180
All right, who's my new...

457
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,180
Who's my new helper?

458
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,060
Joaquim.

459
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,060
All right, Joaquim.

460
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,020
Your movie sucked, but like, let's go.

461
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,940
That's the point, Doki.

462
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,980
You're not supposed to mess these up.

463
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,760
They give us super chat...

464
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,800
Geometry and what?

465
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,560
Geometry and what?

466
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,140
Geometry and what?

467
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,380
Guys, guys!

468
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,220
Geometry and what?

469
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,000
Guys!

470
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,460
Wait...

471
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,480
Geometry and what?

472
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
Oh, math.

473
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:08,620
Okay.

474
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,140
Okay.

475
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,240
You know what?

476
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,160
I don't need your help, Joaquim.

477
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,160
I can read.

478
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,420
My email is jokeycanread.

479
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,360
I would never lie about that.

480
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,400
The fuck is the wind in the willow?

481
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,220
What?

482
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,260
What?

483
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,020
The wind in the willows?

484
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,020
The fuck is a black mamba?

485
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,440
Is that a real animal?

486
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,320
That sounds like...

487
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,080
That sounds like...

488
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,620
I don't know.

489
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,060
The fuck is a black mamba?

490
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,200
Okay, when I start reading, it'd be like the SATs.

491
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,400
This is not the SATs.

492
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,740
This is literally like...

493
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,520
I should have read this book.

494
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,200
Like, I...

495
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,800
Why would I have read this book?

496
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,080
Like...

497
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,000
That's not reading material!

498
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,940
Oh my god.

499
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,260
I would say the mold.

500
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,820
I feel like a lot...

501
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,820
I feel like...

502
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,500
If I was in second grade, I wouldn't be like...

503
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,700
There was a black mamba.

504
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,180
I'd be like...

505
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,380
There's a mold right there.

506
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,420
It has to be a mold.

507
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,100
There's no way.

508
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,860
That's like the easiest animal for second graders.

509
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:20,960
There's no way.

510
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:21,700
I fuck!

511
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,680
Oh, thank god.

512
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:23,760
I was like...

513
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,920
Second graders are too stupid to know what the fuck a black mamba is.

514
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,240
I don't even know what it is.

515
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:28,980
There's no way.

516
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,960
I know a lot of animals, but I don't know what the fuck a black mamba is.

517
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,080
Why are we learning about Joaquin?

518
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,600
He didn't do jack shit.

519
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,080
Fucking nerd.

520
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,800
A whole number is a basic counting number.

521
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,460
Any decimals, fractions, or negatives.

522
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,980
Yeah, and thank you for the...

523
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,540
Math!

524
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,140
Okay.

525
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:54,800
Math.

526
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,880
Joaquin, this is it.

527
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,020
This is your zone.

528
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,980
This is it.

529
00:24:59,360 --> 00:24:59,900
Joaquin.

530
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,220
This is where you gotta...

531
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,380
Wait, what?

532
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,980
Who would learn square roots in second grade?

533
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,440
I was learning multiplications.

534
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,260
End of...

535
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:23,640
Okay.

536
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,740
All right, Joaquin.

537
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,460
This is it.

538
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,880
This is your time to shine, Joaquin.

539
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,980
This is it.

540
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:31,930
This is...

541
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:38,260
I learned square roots not in second grade.

542
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,160
I'm doing multiplications and divisions.

543
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,440
Okay, yeah.

544
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,180
All right, Joaquin.

545
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,840
This is your best division.

546
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:46,940
I don't...

547
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,840
What is the square root?

548
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,860
Wait, what does square root even mean?

549
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,960
I forgot what square root even means.

550
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:56,860
Oh.

551
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,600
Wait, I...

552
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,060
Guys, it's been years.

553
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,400
What is the square root again?

554
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,100
It's been a long time.

555
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,980
It's been a while.

556
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,080
Guys, it's not because I'm stupid.

557
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,680
It's because I had no reason to use math.

558
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:24,420
And like, when will I ever use square root ever in my life?

559
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:29,020
Like, who would just go up to you and be like, what's the square root of 64?

560
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,880
Like, how is that a life or death situation in any way?

561
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,500
Like, what...

562
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,040
In what way can I utilize the square root in real life?

563
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:42,820
And why...

564
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,720
It's because Joaquin is a math god.

565
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,380
I'm gonna use his strengths.

566
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,080
Oh my god, I made it.

567
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,360
I fucking made it, guys.

568
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,000
I skipped another grade.

569
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,120
It only took me five minutes to complete second grade.

570
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,060
Goodbye, Joaquin.

571
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,120
Goodbye.

572
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,580
Who's my next helper?

573
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,700
Architecture and engineers?

574
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,380
Engineers in my chat!

575
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,060
Does anyone ever...

576
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:17,540
Does your...

577
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:18,560
Does your...

578
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,700
Oh, he's spelling and reading.

579
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,080
Okay.

580
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,680
God, I fucking hate you, Hayley.

581
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,280
You fucked me up last time.

582
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,540
All right, engineers in my chat.

583
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:31,760
Does your employer ever go up to you and was like, Hey there, Mr. Engineer.

584
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,440
What's the square root of 64?

585
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,880
In what context would they go up to you and to tell...

586
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,400
Ask you about the square root?

587
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,860
All right, you know what?

588
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,400
We can do vocabulary.

589
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,020
Okay.

590
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,980
No, they're maps.

591
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,320
That's false.

592
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,660
Cartographers are maps.

593
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,780
What the f- Okay, false.

594
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,980
I know what cartography is.

595
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,320
It's for maps.

596
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,020
False.

597
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,700
Yes!

598
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,260
Well, the actual answer is...

599
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,160
False.

600
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,060
Oh, thank God.

601
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,540
I go second-guessing myself.

602
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,500
I was like...

603
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,580
Am I gaslighting myself about that?

604
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,780
Because I can't read maps.

605
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,320
So how the fuck did I know what cartographer was?

606
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,180
I don't even know how I found out what...

607
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,320
Minecraft.

608
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,380
Thank you, Minecraft.

609
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:49,640
When teachers tell you gaming will not help you in any way, they're liars.

610
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,580
Because I learned what cartography was from Minecraft.

611
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,500
What was it?

612
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,320
Vocabulary and spelling?

613
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,120
Right?

614
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,140
Okay, inter-reading.

615
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,040
Okay, spelling.

616
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,220
All right.

617
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,200
All right, Hayley.

618
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,100
This is your favorite subject, Hayley!

619
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,360
It's not math this time!

620
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,700
You can't mess this up, Hayley!

621
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,440
It's not math!

622
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,600
Astronaut?

623
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:30,680
E-X-T-R-A-T-E-R-R...

624
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,680
E-S...

625
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,780
Extra...

626
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,940
Terresti...

627
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,580
True...

628
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,400
Wait...

629
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,000
E...

630
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:52,140
E-X-T-R-A-T-E-R-R-R-E-S-T-O...

631
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:52,440
Three!

632
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,940
It's three!

633
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,280
There's three R's!

634
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,400
Wait, guys, don't fuck me up here.

635
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,500
E-X-T-R...

636
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,700
I'm like, writing...

637
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,980
I'm like, writing it on my mousepad.

638
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,260
T-E-R-R-S-E-S-T...

639
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:13,860
Terresti...

640
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,720
Oh, three!

641
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,680
Okay, it's three.

642
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,600
It's three!

643
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,940
Stop saying...

644
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:19,580
Don't, guys!

645
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,240
No, it's not.

646
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:20,700
I can't...

647
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,880
Don't say it's not four.

648
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,920
There's no way.

649
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,560
Terresti...

650
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,060
Extra-terrestial...

651
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,520
Wait, what?

652
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,600
Where did the extra R come from?

653
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,080
Someone spelled it extra...

654
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,980
Terrestrial?

655
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,280
No!

656
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,620
I thought it's extra-terrestial.

657
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,020
It's terrestrial.

658
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,580
It's terrestrial.

659
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,140
I thought...

660
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,160
He should have used it in the sentence.

661
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,660
If he used it in the sentence, I would have known.

662
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,080
Like...

663
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,060
All I'm saying, chat...

664
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,200
Is that...

665
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,180
If he used it in a sentence...

666
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,760
It would have...

667
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,640
I would have...

668
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,840
It would have been fine.

669
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,920
He didn't use it in a sentence, so it messed me up.

670
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,240
If this was your...

671
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,300
If this was a...

672
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,640
No!

673
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:29,700
No!

674
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,240
Daddy, no!

675
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,740
Put me back in, Daddy!

676
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,460
I swear!

677
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,440
I figured it out!

678
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,820
Minecraft sure did teach you how to spell.

679
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,340
Thank you for the super chat.

680
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,900
Thank you, thank you.

681
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,100
Guys, guys, guys...

682
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,600
I pronounced it wrong and like...

683
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,020
There wasn't any subtitles.

684
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,580
And like...

685
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:55,000
He didn't use it in a sentence, guys.

686
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,660
He didn't use it in the sentence, so it messed me up.

687
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,460
We're never getting to fifth grade level at this...

688
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,120
No, guys!

689
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,660
It was...

690
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,960
This is a practice round.

691
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,980
This is a practice round.

692
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:08,880
Now...

693
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,920
Now, it's the real deal.

694
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,200
Now, we're actually playing the game.

695
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,640
This was like an audition, guys.

696
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,400
Also, Quantum, thank you for the five gifted ships.

697
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,200
Thank you, thank...

698
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,520
Guys, this was just like an audition to be Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader.

699
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,600
I passed, so...

700
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,120
Because I passed, we're actually on the show now.

701
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,960
World geography and animals?

702
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,280
Does this look like there's world geography?

703
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,740
Okay, social studies, dude.

704
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,440
It can't be that bad.

705
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,000
Social studies was really easy.

706
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,340
I'm not American?

707
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,540
I don't even have...

708
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,440
I don't even...

709
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,740
I don't even...

710
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,300
Guys, I don't even have a...

711
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,500
I'm fucking Canadian!

712
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,900
You know what we have on our nickel?

713
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,180
A beaver.

714
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,920
Like, like...

715
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,040
I don't know!

716
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,980
I have a beaver on my nickel?

717
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,360
I don't fucking know!

718
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,620
Is it true?

719
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:21,740
Okay, look.

720
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,760
I can use...

721
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,620
I should be allowed to use assistance.

722
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:29,580
Because I just know what a Canadian nickel looks like.

723
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:30,500
Like...

724
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,120
We're not keeping time, so take your time.

725
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:32,880
Oh, yeah.

726
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,700
Oh, thank God.

727
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,080
Is it true or false?

728
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,140
Guys...

729
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,380
Oh my God.

730
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,940
Okay, it's the beaver named Thomas Jefferson.

731
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,740
I don't know!

732
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,560
You know what?

733
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,280
We're gonna ask the class.

734
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,840
All right, class.

735
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,820
Any Americans in my class right now?

736
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,600
All right, class.

737
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,460
What do they think?

738
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,500
Are there any Americans in my class?

739
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,680
Do you have your coins with you?

740
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,800
Oh, thank God.

741
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,680
It's true, okay.

742
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,800
All right, okay.

743
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,580
The whole class thinks it's true, guys.

744
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,820
The whole class.

745
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,340
The real question is Thomas Jefferson the beaver.

746
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:28,160
Thank you for your very first super chat.

747
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:28,940
Thank you.

748
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:29,580
Thank you.

749
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,060
All right.

750
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:30,980
All right.

751
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,640
My Americans think it's true.

752
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,980
My American classmates think it's true.

753
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,880
Oh, thank God.

754
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:42,600
I was gonna be like, none of my classmates are American if they don't know this.

755
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,720
We did not need to know.

756
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,780
I don't have...

757
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,460
What do you want me to do?

758
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,860
Google the answer.

759
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,300
Be like, Alexa, what is the...

760
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,060
I don't even have a fucking...

761
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,320
Whatever the Alexa shit is.

762
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:02,360
All right.

763
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,980
All right, let's do vocabulary.

764
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,420
How bad can that be?

765
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,020
It's like first grade.

766
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,560
It's a first grade vocab question.

767
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,680
Oh, plane.

768
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,420
Okay, first graders don't know jack shit about aviation.

769
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,400
Like, it's one.

770
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,980
Guys, don't like gaslight me.

771
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,220
Like, I know it's one.

772
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,380
Because aviation is like avian.

773
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,840
And avian is a bird.

774
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,060
So like, and I'm jokey bird.

775
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:41,680
So like, because I know what birds are, I know it has to be a plane.

776
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:51,180
I'm saying eight-year-olds should not...

777
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,760
Eight is like first grade, right?

778
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,320
Or seven.

779
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,700
They should not know what the fuck aviators are.

780
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,300
Like, how?

781
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,280
How would they know what an aviator is?

782
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,480
That's not first grade level.

783
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,040
I didn't know what aviators are.

784
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,760
To be fair, I refuse to read in first grade.

785
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,460
That might be the worst possible logic.

786
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,380
This ain't about you, Amelia Earhart.

787
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:24,020
Okay, but like, she's American.

788
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,520
And like, I was in Canada in first grade.

789
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,280
And we did not give a fuck about Amelia Earhart.

790
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,840
I learned about Amelia Earhart from Night at the Museum.

791
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:41,160
Because nobody in Canada cared about who Amelia Earhart was.

792
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:50,160
Oh shit, she's fluent in languages.

793
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,640
I already forgot.

794
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,460
Okay, foreign languages and social studies.

795
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,000
Oh, thank God!

796
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,720
Thank God, Ava.

797
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:00,180
We have social studies right now.

798
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,560
That sounds Hawaiian.

799
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,180
That has to be Hawaiian, right?

800
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,660
Like, I mean...

801
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,600
That's a Hawaiian word.

802
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,120
Like...

803
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,260
That's literally a...

804
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,900
I don't think it's Mississippi.

805
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,760
Or South Dakota.

806
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,480
Wherever the fuck South Dakota is.

807
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,620
Is there a North Dakota?

808
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,200
Wait, is there?

809
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,380
Wait, there is.

810
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,800
Is there a West Dakota?

811
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,260
Bro, what the fuck?

812
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,660
How many Dakotas are...

813
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:40,800
I don't even know how many Dakotas there are in fucking America.

814
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:41,820
But I know it's Hawaii.

815
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,140
I was like, it's South Dakota.

816
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,440
Now you're gonna tell me there's a North Dakota.

817
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,320
And I'm like, wait, there is a North Dakota.

818
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:51,720
I remember.

819
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,120
I remember there's a North Dakota.

820
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,630
Thank God, Ava.

821
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,250
Yeah, give us a little fun fact.

822
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,430
Oh, wait, really?

823
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:11,930
That's cool.

824
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,310
That's so cool, Ava.

825
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:14,750
Also, give me a sec.

826
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:15,330
I need to...

827
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:18,350
I need to adjust my volume real quick, guys.

828
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:19,710
Give me a sec.

829
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:21,870
Alright.

830
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,330
Alright, we're back in it.

831
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,010
Alright, Ava.

832
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:32,270
Alright, social studies.

833
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:34,730
Nobody's gonna save us in either of these.

834
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:35,510
So...

835
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:38,050
So we're gonna do social studies.

836
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:43,890
Alright.

837
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:49,650
Isn't that the cult?

838
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:51,610
That's the cult, right?

839
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:53,530
That's the Kool-Aid.

840
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,130
Why is the Kool-Aid thing in my fucking...

841
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,070
Why is it...

842
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,250
Oh my God.

843
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:02,590
I don't even know where each of the state is.

844
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,890
Oh, that's Jonestown.

845
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:12,330
Wait, what the fuck is...

846
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:13,610
There's several...

847
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:16,290
There's several J-towns?

848
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:19,070
Where am I?

849
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,290
Okay, that's...

850
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:22,210
That's Hawaii.

851
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:23,430
That's Alaska.

852
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:24,670
Because I know...

853
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,430
I know that's supposed to be Canada.

854
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,030
Yeah, okay.

855
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:31,630
What the fuck?

856
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,310
Where am I?

857
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,950
I don't even know what state I'm in right now.

858
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:36,610
Is this Florida?

859
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:39,250
That's Florida, because it's the dick, right?

860
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:44,510
I'm like, where am I?

861
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:46,090
Where have you been?

862
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:48,770
Okay, what...

863
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:51,490
This is West, and so East is here.

864
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:59,550
All right, I don't know where...

865
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:01,370
I don't even know where I am right now.

866
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:02,910
Like, what is this state?

867
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:05,510
I'm cheating.

868
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:06,390
There's no way.

869
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:09,430
I can't even recognize any of the states.

870
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:11,770
Oh my God, like...

871
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:16,510
I don't know if Ava can even answer this.

872
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:18,950
Her fucking best subjects are...

873
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:21,450
Her best subjects are like...

874
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:23,030
Okay, I'm asking you, all right.

875
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,990
Ava, what do you think, Ava?

876
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:33,710
That's it?

877
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,570
Ava, answer.

878
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,410
Tell me the answer.

879
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,790
All right, Ava.

880
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,550
It's all on you.

881
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,970
I didn't get past the second grade.

882
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,470
It's all on you, Ava.

883
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:53,350
If it's so fucking easy.

884
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:57,010
Oh,

885
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:02,770
please, Ava.

886
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:05,550
Please, you must know geography better than me.

887
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:07,350
What is it?

888
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:11,150
What the fuck even is that?

889
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:14,530
They don't even tell me what state this is?

890
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:16,550
It's all blocks to me.

891
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,330
Is that Virginia?

892
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,830
Oh shit, okay, it's Virginia.

893
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:23,710
What even is a Jamestown?

894
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,630
Is Jamestown supposed to be famous?

895
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:28,590
Like...

896
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:31,570
Oh my God, she's so locked in.

897
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,590
She knows her country.

898
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:38,730
If only Jamestown was in Minecraft, then I would know.

899
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:39,950
All right.

900
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:43,290
It's a town owned by James.

901
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:45,910
Is this where all the James came from?

902
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:51,530
Any fellow James, can you vouch that you came from Jamestown?

903
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:53,570
The birthplace of all James.

904
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:56,690
Oh my God, I made it.

905
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:59,530
I made it to the third grade chat.

906
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:04,250
Oh my God, goodbye, Ava.

907
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:06,430
Thanks for coming in clutch.

908
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:09,350
Every James came from Virginia.

909
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:15,170
If you want to name your child James, you have to give birth in Virginia.

910
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:21,470
All right, Joaquim, you got this, Joaquim.

911
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:28,470
All right, Joaquim, this is it.

912
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:31,070
I think we only have math or geometry left.

913
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:35,390
All right, wait, I can't even ask a classmate because I already asked him.

914
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:37,550
Okay.

915
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:39,050
You know what?

916
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:40,070
Let's go with...

917
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,730
Let's go with life sciences.

918
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,250
I have...

919
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:48,010
I don't have cheats anymore, so we're gonna go with life sciences.

920
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:50,390
Because, like, he can't help me anyway.

921
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:51,830
He can't help me.

922
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:53,850
I already used my ask a classmate.

923
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:55,390
All right.

924
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:58,770
Let's go.

925
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:03,670
Like, what?

926
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:04,190
What's...

927
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:06,390
How difficult is life science anyway?

928
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:12,170
Mercury poisoning may occur if you eat too much of certain types of fish.

929
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:12,970
What?

930
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:16,350
Why would you even...

931
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:18,010
Nuclear...

932
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:18,250
No?

933
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:19,710
Pick an answer for us.

934
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:20,950
What fish?

935
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:25,750
What kind of fish...

936
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:26,470
What do you mean...

937
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:28,350
What kind of fish does that?

938
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:30,450
Wait.

939
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:33,490
Could I be getting mercury poisoning?

940
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,030
Like...

941
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:41,470
Like...

942
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:46,110
Have I been unintentionally giving myself mercury poisoning?

943
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:47,630
That's a thing?

944
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:50,410
Wait, true?

945
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:54,770
Oh my God.

946
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:56,390
There's no way.

947
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:03,050
What?

948
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:04,970
What fish?

949
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:07,310
Teddy, what fish?

950
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:09,550
Teddy, no, you can't just say true.

951
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:10,630
What fish, Teddy?

952
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:11,830
What...

953
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:12,830
Fish?

954
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:13,910
What fish?

955
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:18,710
How do I avoid not getting mercury poisoning?

956
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:20,270
What fish, Teddy?

957
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:24,590
Salmon?

958
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:26,910
I eat so much salmon.

959
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:28,460
Am I getting...

960
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:32,430
Have I been giving myself mercury poisoning this entire time?

961
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:37,170
I live in Canada, chat!

962
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:40,410
That is like the one fish we always eat.

963
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:41,290
That's...

964
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:42,200
It's like our...

965
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:46,850
I have smoked salmon in my fucking fridge.

966
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:48,130
What are you...

967
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:53,090
I literally have smoked salmon right now in my goddamn fridge.

968
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:54,130
What do you...

969
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:55,910
What do you mean I get mercury?

970
00:44:56,290 --> 00:45:01,510
Why did it take me this long to find that out from a fucking video game?

971
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:03,430
About fifth graders.

972
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:08,570
It's a national fish of Canada.

973
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:12,530
Okay, why did we give ourselves merc...

974
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:13,570
All right, you know what?

975
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:14,830
I feel a little adventurous.

976
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:18,170
I might die soon because I have mercury poisoning, apparently.

977
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:20,550
I've been slowly giving myself mercury poisoning.

978
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:28,910
Wait, is this 13 times 4?

979
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:32,670
Hey, that's 13 times 4.

980
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:37,590
I'm pretty sure it's not.

981
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:40,310
Guys, what's 13 times 70...

982
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:41,510
Oh, it's 13 times 4.

983
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:45,510
Okay, 13 times 4...

984
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:47,650
4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

985
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:50,490
That's 2, 4...

986
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:50,990
52!

987
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:53,550
Wait, how is my answer different?

988
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:57,370
How's my answer...

989
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:59,210
Wait, no, I fucked up.

990
00:45:59,290 --> 00:45:59,930
That's a dish...

991
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:00,680
Guys, I...

992
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:02,530
Guys, I...

993
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:03,200
How is my...

994
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:04,650
How is my...

995
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:05,110
How...

996
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,150
Wait, 5?

997
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:08,710
Why is it 5?

998
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:10,350
It gave birth to 4.

999
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:12,990
13 times...

1000
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:15,930
Where did the 13 and 5 come from?

1001
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:18,190
Oh my god, I'm...

1002
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:18,930
Oh no...

1003
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:23,470
Where did the 13 come from?

1004
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:26,170
Oh wait, 13 is what it says.

1005
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:28,090
Wait, where did the 5 come from?

1006
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:32,190
Wait...

1007
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:33,910
Oh, 52?

1008
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:36,430
Plus...

1009
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:38,330
13...

1010
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:40,090
5...

1011
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:40,590
5...

1012
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:41,070
65!

1013
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:43,490
It's 65, guys.

1014
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:45,050
Guys, it's 65.

1015
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:47,090
Guys, I figured it out.

1016
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:47,730
It's 65.

1017
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:49,350
This has to be it.

1018
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:50,030
There's no way.

1019
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:51,430
Guys, I...

1020
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:54,830
Guys, I'm learning how to read live right now with you guys.

1021
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:56,650
But it's 65.

1022
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:57,510
I...

1023
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:58,610
Plus the 13.

1024
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:00,490
Plus...

1025
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:05,150
Please tell me it's 65.

1026
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:06,050
Oh, thank god.

1027
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:08,590
No doubt you're out, Wocky.

1028
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:11,290
Without your fucking help, Wocky.

1029
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:18,150
Oh my god, we're...

1030
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:18,710
It's okay.

1031
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:20,250
We're doing it.

1032
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:21,070
We're learning.

1033
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:23,850
We're figuring it out as we go along.

1034
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:27,210
Oh my god, we're in fourth grade.

1035
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:28,390
We're halfway.

1036
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:31,030
Guys, we're one grade away from fifth grade.

1037
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:35,090
Our personal best chat.

1038
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:43,990
I can't believe I asked the class in first grade because I didn't have a nickel.

1039
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:47,790
I already used my...

1040
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:49,850
Asked the class because of it.

1041
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:52,710
Just because I didn't have a...

1042
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:54,590
That's just because I'm not American.

1043
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:01,230
It wasn't fair.

1044
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:02,710
It's not fair.

1045
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:04,150
All right, spelling.

1046
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:04,950
It can't be...

1047
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:07,410
Spelling.

1048
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:08,330
We can do this.

1049
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:09,270
We'll redeem ourselves.

1050
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:11,190
We'll redeem ourselves here, chat.

1051
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:11,750
This is it.

1052
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:15,110
This is where we're gonna redeem everything, guys.

1053
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:16,050
I believe.

1054
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:17,770
Johnny, thank you for the Akasupa.

1055
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:18,790
Thank you, thank you.

1056
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:21,870
So, textbooks are expensive, but I feel like I might end up buying one.

1057
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:24,070
So there's something to help out.

1058
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:25,830
Thank you for the Akasupa.

1059
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:27,030
Thank you, thank you.

1060
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:28,330
All right.

1061
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:32,430
The fourth letter of the following word.

1062
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:33,550
Voice.

1063
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:36,770
What?

1064
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:38,770
What did she say?

1065
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:39,970
S.

1066
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:41,970
C.

1067
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:42,650
Voice?

1068
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:45,710
What did she say?

1069
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:47,990
If you're a gamer, choose the right answer.

1070
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:48,910
Wait, repeat your...

1071
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:49,190
Wait.

1072
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:50,370
Repeat question.

1073
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:52,810
What is the fourth letter of the following word?

1074
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:53,970
Voice.

1075
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:55,870
Is it voice?

1076
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:56,450
I.

1077
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:58,350
V-O-I-C.

1078
00:48:58,670 --> 00:48:59,290
Oh, it's C.

1079
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:00,950
It's C.

1080
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:04,750
It's C.

1081
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:05,830
It's now locked in.

1082
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:07,930
How is this fourth grade?

1083
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:10,850
The answer is...

1084
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:11,430
C.

1085
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:13,110
How is this fourth grade?

1086
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:17,250
I got extraterrestrial at second grade.

1087
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:24,730
How did I get extraterrestrial at second grade?

1088
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:27,370
And then voice at fourth?

1089
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:39,150
Oh my god.

1090
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:40,850
Extraterrestrial.

1091
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:42,770
Sorry, extraterrestrial.

1092
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:49,890
Okay, social studies.

1093
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,750
Because like, they're not helping me out anyway.

1094
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:54,950
Social studies time.

1095
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,310
Like, I'm literally...

1096
00:49:56,310 --> 00:49:58,230
I have to go in blind now.

1097
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:02,970
The former site of the Ottoman Empire is now known as...

1098
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:03,230
Turkey!

1099
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:07,350
Wait, am I wrong?

1100
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:10,590
Nuclear gamer, pick up your answer.

1101
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:11,910
If I get that wrong?

1102
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:15,390
It is.

1103
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:16,090
Yeah, it's Turkey.

1104
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:17,010
But where is Turkey?

1105
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:18,730
Wait, where the fuck is...

1106
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:20,750
Wait.

1107
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:21,730
Wait.

1108
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:24,510
Okay, I got the...

1109
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:25,690
I got the name right.

1110
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:27,110
But where is Turkey?

1111
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:31,970
Guys.

1112
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:33,550
Guys, I got...

1113
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:35,430
No, I got the answer right.

1114
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:37,490
But where the fuck is Turkey?

1115
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:38,010
Wait, no.

1116
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:40,110
Wait, where's Turkey though?

1117
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,050
I don't know.

1118
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:43,370
Okay.

1119
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:46,010
Where could Turkey be?

1120
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:49,570
Wait, where's Greece?

1121
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:52,170
Guys, you can't be like, it's next to Greece.

1122
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,490
I don't even know where Greece is.

1123
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,970
Wait, where the fuck is Turkey?

1124
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:01,570
Guys, I...

1125
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:02,630
Guys, okay.

1126
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:04,370
This is obviously Russia.

1127
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:06,790
This has to be Russia right here.

1128
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:09,790
Isn't this...

1129
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:10,850
This not Turkey?

1130
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:13,030
I'll say the question once more.

1131
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:13,430
Please.

1132
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:16,190
Where is it?

1133
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:19,110
Where could it be?

1134
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:21,490
Okay.

1135
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:23,110
I don't know.

1136
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:24,350
But...

1137
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:25,630
To the left?

1138
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:29,450
I was right.

1139
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:30,020
Is this...

1140
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:32,050
This is Turkey?

1141
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:34,230
Turkey's that big?

1142
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:37,450
Is that...

1143
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:40,230
I swear to God, if this is not Turkey, I swear...

1144
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:41,770
I swear to fucking God.

1145
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:44,980
Oh yeah, because I...

1146
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:46,250
No, I...

1147
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:48,750
I need to load like, land borders now.

1148
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:51,270
Okay.

1149
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:52,110
Okay.

1150
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:58,130
I need to know the fucking land borders of countries now.

1151
00:51:58,310 --> 00:51:59,630
Like, the fuck is this?

1152
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:03,410
No fourth graders should know this.

1153
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:08,670
Mr. San, thank you for the magenta soup.

1154
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:09,310
Thank you.

1155
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:09,910
Thank you.

1156
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:13,170
Buns to add a T between can and read.

1157
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:16,850
Thank you for the magenta soup.

1158
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:17,510
Thank you.

1159
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:18,290
Thank you.

1160
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:20,950
It's time to check out the points again.

1161
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:23,030
Oh my God, we made it so far.

1162
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:25,210
Guys, we made it so far.

1163
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:27,490
Guys, we can't fuck this up, chat.

1164
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:29,130
Oh my God.

1165
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:29,930
Wait, are we...

1166
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:32,910
Are we in the fifth grade now?

1167
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:35,170
Are we gonna be in the fifth grade?

1168
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:36,610
Did we...

1169
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:38,590
We made it!

1170
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:41,570
We made it to the fifth grade!

1171
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:44,990
Oh my God, chat, we did it!

1172
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:49,050
We're almost gonna head to middle school.

1173
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:52,530
Goodbye, you were no fucking help, Ellie.

1174
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:57,390
Our personal best.

1175
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:00,730
Oh my God, our personal best, guys.

1176
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:01,870
We peaked.

1177
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,700
Well, it doesn't matter.

1178
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,860
This is all cosmetic.

1179
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:12,580
It's like...

1180
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:17,660
It's like, have a child by your side that's just there.

1181
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,480
Like, as your emotional support.

1182
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:23,580
I was gonna say animal, but I was like, I shouldn't say that about kids.

1183
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,440
My emotional support child.

1184
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:28,460
You know what?

1185
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,120
I feel like I've been crushing it at life sciences.

1186
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,800
Reading is just bullshit.

1187
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:37,620
Reading was literally like, hey, read...

1188
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:38,680
Do you know what's in this?

1189
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:39,540
What is...

1190
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:40,160
I'm not...

1191
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,960
Guys, guys, I don't think...

1192
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,980
Guys, we're not making it out of the fifth grade and we're doing measurements.

1193
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:47,580
I don't know any of my measurements, guys.

1194
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:48,540
I don't know.

1195
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,160
I don't know, guys.

1196
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,700
I don't...

1197
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,180
I don't think I could do measurements, guys.

1198
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:56,620
I...

1199
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:59,560
I want to make it past fifth grade, chat.

1200
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:00,260
Like...

1201
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:03,660
I guess...

1202
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:08,060
And the worst part is that US measurements are different from the rest of the world.

1203
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,300
It's...

1204
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,940
It's different from the rest of the world.

1205
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,660
I haven't failed life sciences yet.

1206
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:18,280
All right.

1207
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,720
As the father of genetics, what Austrian...

1208
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:24,460
Wait...

1209
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,480
Mende?

1210
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:27,500
Mende?

1211
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:28,420
Right?

1212
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:29,820
Gregor Mendel.

1213
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:30,380
Yeah.

1214
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,440
Carl Linnaeus.

1215
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:32,960
Mende.

1216
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:35,200
George Washington Carver.

1217
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:37,320
The fuck is the president to?

1218
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,800
George Washington Carver?

1219
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,720
Like, what did the president fucking do?

1220
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,740
I knew it.

1221
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:48,820
I knew it.

1222
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:49,160
I...

1223
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:49,880
Oh my god.

1224
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:54,560
Guys, the reason why I knew about the pea plants is the box thing.

1225
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:55,700
The box grid.

1226
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,740
And we did that so much.

1227
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:59,320
And it's Gregor Mendel.

1228
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:00,120
I fucking...

1229
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:00,780
I remember.

1230
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,000
I remember.

1231
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:05,080
Wait, Carver isn't a president?

1232
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,560
Who the fuck is George Washington Carver?

1233
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:10,520
That's a different...

1234
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:13,820
Wait...

1235
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,620
Who's George Washington Carver?

1236
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:17,500
Who is he?

1237
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,580
Thank you for joining us.

1238
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:26,160
You know who Mendel is, but you don't know what whole number is.

1239
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:27,840
I was...

1240
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,040
I was...

1241
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,960
I was acting.

1242
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:34,840
Guys...

1243
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,840
Guys, I was acting.

1244
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:40,480
All right.

1245
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:41,940
I told you.

1246
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,520
Life sciences is where we at.

1247
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:46,560
Okay.

1248
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:48,940
Okay.

1249
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:51,580
I know vocabulary.

1250
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:54,060
Like...

1251
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:54,720
What...

1252
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:59,880
What kind of vocabulary question would be a bad vocabulary question that's gonna ruin this run?

1253
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:01,900
Like...

1254
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:02,440
What was...

1255
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:03,660
We're not doing...

1256
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,480
Guys, reading is like...

1257
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:06,440
Here's a book.

1258
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,000
Who wants to...

1259
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:08,360
You don't...

1260
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:08,720
Fuck it.

1261
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:09,080
All right.

1262
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:09,540
Let's...

1263
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:12,260
Let's see how bullshit this question is.

1264
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:16,840
All right.

1265
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:21,060
We have...

1266
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:21,480
We have...

1267
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,300
We have a...

1268
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,200
We can like ask a different question.

1269
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:25,920
If we fuck this up.

1270
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:27,420
Oh!

1271
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:29,660
Oh.

1272
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:33,140
Guys, I never watched...

1273
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,100
I never read The Giver, but I knew this...

1274
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:35,360
Joe?

1275
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:36,880
Is it Nick?

1276
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:37,650
It sounds like...

1277
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,120
Nick Jonas.

1278
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,620
Is it the Jonas Brothers?

1279
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:47,720
Is it...

1280
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:52,000
I...

1281
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:52,580
You know what?

1282
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:55,480
In memory of the Jonas Brothers...

1283
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:00,020
Because we had Nick Jonas in the Jonas Brothers.

1284
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:01,680
I...

1285
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:03,320
It was...

1286
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:08,860
The Giver was popular around the time the Jonas Brothers were really popular for like...

1287
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,700
Elementary and middle school students.

1288
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:11,630
So like...

1289
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:13,190
By the power...

1290
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,160
Of the three boys...

1291
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:17,050
I would pick...

1292
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:18,400
Jonas.

1293
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,560
Wait, Joe Jonas too!

1294
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,840
Wait, isn't Joe also a Jonas Brother?

1295
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,760
Okay, it has to be Jonas.

1296
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:30,860
It has to be Jonas.

1297
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,320
Oh, thank Jonas Brothers!

1298
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:39,880
Oh, thank God!

1299
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,180
Oh my God!

1300
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,800
Oh, the Jonas Brothers came in clutch!

1301
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,240
It brought us classic like...

1302
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,660
The turns have tabled.

1303
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:57,200
One last question!

1304
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,180
We can't fumble this!

1305
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,440
There's no way we can fuck this up.

1306
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,460
Guys, there's no way.

1307
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,180
There's no way.

1308
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,620
Praise to be a Jonas Brother, right?

1309
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,760
There's no way we could fuck this up, chat.

1310
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,000
Like, how?

1311
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:16,500
You know what?

1312
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:22,280
I'm so confident that we made it to middle school!

1313
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:23,840
Let's do it.

1314
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:25,960
Let's fucking do it.

1315
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,360
I'm so confident.

1316
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,820
This is like my character arc.

1317
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:36,120
We led up to like the hardest subject ever in America in freedom units.

1318
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:46,920
Hoppus.

1319
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:48,860
Happus.

1320
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:53,160
Nuclear gamer.

1321
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:54,740
Do you have the answer?

1322
00:58:59,330 --> 00:58:59,490
What?

1323
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:09,570
Hippocampus?

1324
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:14,230
Wait, how is this measurement?

1325
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:14,490
Hippus.

1326
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:18,290
Hippus, hoppus, happus.

1327
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:19,890
What the fuck?

1328
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:23,130
Wait.

1329
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:25,270
One hippus, please.

1330
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:27,270
I know, I know.

1331
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:28,530
I like one.

1332
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,970
I like one.

1333
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:35,170
One hoppus of timber, my good sir.

1334
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:39,610
What the fuck?

1335
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:42,150
What the fuck are these units?

1336
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:44,450
Um, all right.

1337
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:45,110
I don't...

1338
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:46,070
Ah, hippus.

1339
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:48,770
You got the answer.

1340
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:51,350
Well, the right answer is...

1341
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:54,530
Hoppus.

1342
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:57,390
Good try, but that's not the right answer.

1343
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:06,440
Unfortunately, you are not smarter than a fifth grader.

1344
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,260
But we'd love to have you again very soon.

1345
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:10,140
But I made it to sixth grade!

1346
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,160
Let's see what that did to your final scores.

1347
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,980
Congratulations, what a great score!

1348
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:17,060
I made it to...

1349
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:17,540
I...

1350
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:19,300
Who can answer that?

1351
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,180
Who the fuck?

1352
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,500
That didn't be on my permanent record?

1353
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:25,260
I thought...

1354
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:29,300
I thought schools don't look at your permanent record until high school.

1355
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:33,640
I just made it to middle school.

1356
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:37,080
What do you...

1357
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,500
What do you mean?

1358
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:41,440
What do you mean I...

1359
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,800
I put something on my permanent record.

1360
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:46,080
Oh, don't you...

1361
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:46,560
Don't...

1362
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:50,240
No, I'm not gonna get into my top university choice chat.

1363
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:55,520
She hippus on my hoppus till I have this.

1364
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:58,560
Absolute imperial units.

1365
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:02,260
America really won't teach any measurement, but...

1366
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:05,480
Thank you for the super chat.

1367
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:06,320
Thank you.

1368
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,160
Thank you, Ajoa.

1369
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,200
For all I just wanna be.

1370
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,400
Oh, please.

1371
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:13,160
Get me out of school.

1372
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,760
Oh, my God.

1373
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,480
Get me out of school.

1374
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,580
We were so close.

1375
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,380
We were so fucking close.

1376
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:30,660
I should have used ask a classmate in first grade.

1377
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:34,840
But to be fair, I didn't think I'd make it that far.

1378
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:40,180
I didn't think I'd make it this far.

1379
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:44,400
There's something more fake than freedom units.

1380
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:47,340
Blast.

1381
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:48,340
Thank you for the super chat.

1382
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:48,740
Thank you.

1383
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:49,300
Thank you.

1384
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,820
Guys, I repeated elementary school like four times.

1385
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:54,540
All right.

1386
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,200
All right, let's do reading.

1387
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:00,980
Can't be that bad.

1388
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:03,240
It's first grade.

1389
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:05,260
It's first grade.

1390
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:07,360
True or false?

1391
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:10,060
In The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe...

1392
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:13,400
Mr. Tumnus is a faun that lives in...

1393
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,300
Is that what they're called?

1394
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:15,840
That the...

1395
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:16,760
The half...

1396
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:17,760
The half...

1397
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,160
No, he's a goat.

1398
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:20,440
He's not a faun.

1399
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:21,980
He's a goat.

1400
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,120
Played by James McAvoy.

1401
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,440
God, he was so hot in that.

1402
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:27,760
He was so...

1403
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:28,840
He was...

1404
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:32,960
Is that what they're called?

1405
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:33,820
A faun?

1406
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:36,460
But he was like a half goat thing.

1407
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:40,680
What?

1408
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,320
James McAvoy was...

1409
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,880
James McAvoy was...

1410
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,280
Was Mr. Tumnus!

1411
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:46,800
Okay.

1412
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:47,720
True.

1413
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,920
Oh, thank God.

1414
01:02:58,440 --> 01:02:59,760
Thank you, James McAvoy.

1415
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:04,600
Thank you, James McAvoy.

1416
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,280
So, Halima.

1417
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:09,200
Thanks for joining us here.

1418
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,980
Can you tell us a fun fact you learned recently?

1419
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:13,380
Yeah, Helena.

1420
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,520
Never feed honey to a baby less than a year old.

1421
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,880
The bacteria can cause infant botulism.

1422
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:23,800
Oh my God, Halima just unlocked a new fear.

1423
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:25,260
Like...

1424
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,200
Oh my God.

1425
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:28,540
Does that mean they die?

1426
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,640
Wait, Halima, what the fuck?

1427
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,580
Like, how is that a fun fact, Halima?

1428
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:36,580
Like...

1429
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,060
How is that...

1430
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:42,260
That wasn't fun at all.

1431
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,120
How is that fun?

1432
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:54,320
This...

1433
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,100
The fuck?

1434
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:57,240
No.

1435
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:58,880
No, it is a fruit.

1436
01:03:58,920 --> 01:03:59,420
That's false.

1437
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:00,140
There's no way.

1438
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:03,800
That has to be false.

1439
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,320
There's no fucking way.

1440
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:13,580
Alright, it has to be false.

1441
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:14,520
There's no way.

1442
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:17,480
When you want a fruit juice, mango is in it.

1443
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:20,440
Like, mango's in...

1444
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,580
Mango's like...

1445
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:22,760
In a fruit juice.

1446
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:24,190
Okay, I...

1447
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,040
I thought I was getting gasolated my entire life.

1448
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:28,820
I'm like...

1449
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:30,600
I'm second doubting myself now.

1450
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:31,560
Like...

1451
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:32,760
I'm actually...

1452
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:32,800
I'm actually...

1453
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:36,660
I'm second doubting myself in reality.

1454
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:37,700
Like, I don't know.

1455
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:38,500
I was like, oh my god.

1456
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:39,580
Have I been living a lie?

1457
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,960
Are mangoes actually a vegetable this entire time?

1458
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:44,740
Like...

1459
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:45,900
Was I...

1460
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:48,720
Was I fucking with myself when I thought it was a fruit?

1461
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:53,280
Okay, I'm not okay.

1462
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,840
I had hippest, hoppest, and huppest.

1463
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:57,340
Like...

1464
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:58,900
I'm not okay.

1465
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:00,840
What the fuck is a hoppest?

1466
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:03,240
Like, how much is a hoppest?

1467
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:06,540
Anyway, how many centimeters is in a hoppest?

1468
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:10,780
Why did they ditch hoppest as a...

1469
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:13,720
We all know why they ditched hoppest as a measuring unit.

1470
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:15,710
Because why the fuck would you call...

1471
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:17,310
Why would you call...

1472
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:20,280
I am five hoppests tall.

1473
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:21,540
Like, who says that?

1474
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:22,720
Who...

1475
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:26,580
Okay.

1476
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:27,440
That's...

1477
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:29,060
Okay.

1478
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:31,640
All right, world geography.

1479
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:36,000
I don't think we've ever had world geography or animal science.

1480
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,240
All right, vocabulary.

1481
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:38,260
No, spelling.

1482
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,020
It's second grade.

1483
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:40,080
It can't be that bad.

1484
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:41,200
It's second grade.

1485
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:45,620
I'll cast a spell on you.

1486
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:50,800
Wait.

1487
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:01,300
September,

1488
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:08,870
October, November, the 9th?

1489
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:23,760
January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, September, October, November, ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP...

1490
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:23,980
Okay.

1491
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:27,420
Sorry.

1492
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:29,580
I need to make sure.

1493
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:31,800
I knew S was after N.

1494
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:38,820
But then, now that I'm put in this prescient situation, I'm like, is it though?

1495
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:43,540
Like, is it really after N?

1496
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:47,320
I'm like, I'm second-guessing everything, chat.

1497
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,380
Like, I'm like, is it actually after N now?

1498
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,540
Like, I don't know.

1499
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,160
I don't know anymore.

1500
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,300
Like, it has to be the ninth month.

1501
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:57,320
It has to be.

1502
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:05,240
Has to be.

1503
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:06,900
Yes, we did it.

1504
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:07,940
September.

1505
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,060
Let's go, September.

1506
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:11,300
Let's go.

1507
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,820
The hop is actually broken.

1508
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:24,060
The hop is an extraterrestrial.

1509
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:27,620
Let's check the next question.

1510
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:31,380
I think the most fun fact was from the girl that said...

1511
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,560
Don't give children...

1512
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:37,720
Don't give babies honey, or they'll die.

1513
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:41,080
I'm like, thank you for the fun fact?

1514
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:42,060
All right.

1515
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:42,620
You know what?

1516
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:43,520
Let's do measurement.

1517
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:44,500
It's second grade.

1518
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,580
It can't be as bad as sixth grade now.

1519
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,560
There's no way it's worse than sixth grade.

1520
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:53,240
It was so fun.

1521
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:05,080
Kilo is more than grams, right?

1522
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:09,480
Oh.

1523
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:30,490
What's just...

1524
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:32,080
What's the...

1525
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:37,510
Oh.

1526
01:08:44,730 --> 01:08:46,250
What's a kilogram?

1527
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:56,150
That's what...

1528
01:08:56,150 --> 01:08:56,750
Wait, what's...

1529
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:57,610
What's kg?

1530
01:08:58,970 --> 01:09:01,450
Don't do this to us.

1531
01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:07,230
It's just you and us.

1532
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:08,450
Take as long as you need.

1533
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:10,610
No, Teddy, don't say that.

1534
01:09:11,050 --> 01:09:11,650
I have...

1535
01:09:11,650 --> 01:09:15,630
I have 14 people judging me right now.

1536
01:09:15,710 --> 01:09:17,850
It's not just us, Teddy.

1537
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:18,650
It's...

1538
01:09:18,650 --> 01:09:19,070
It's...

1539
01:09:19,070 --> 01:09:20,910
No, it's so much worse.

1540
01:09:21,470 --> 01:09:22,130
It's...

1541
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:24,950
It's so much worse.

1542
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:27,670
It's not just us.

1543
01:09:29,190 --> 01:09:30,710
No pressure.

1544
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:31,970
No.

1545
01:09:32,350 --> 01:09:32,790
Okay.

1546
01:09:37,150 --> 01:09:40,050
Oh, shut the fuck up, guys.

1547
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:45,450
All right, let's...

1548
01:09:45,450 --> 01:09:47,570
Let's get a new question in.

1549
01:09:48,130 --> 01:09:48,430
Let's get...

1550
01:09:48,430 --> 01:09:52,770
Let's get a new question in.

1551
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:54,070
I've...

1552
01:09:56,430 --> 01:09:58,190
Let's get...

1553
01:09:58,190 --> 01:09:58,710
I died.

1554
01:10:02,690 --> 01:10:03,210
Okay.

1555
01:10:05,350 --> 01:10:07,330
Wait, the same type?

1556
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:13,070
What?

1557
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:27,080
What's three quarters?

1558
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:29,140
How is this worse?

1559
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:30,960
How is this...

1560
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:32,940
How is this harder?

1561
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:38,120
It's just harder.

1562
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:43,040
How much is three quarters of a meter?

1563
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:46,040
How many millimeters is a meter?

1564
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:48,000
It's like a hundred, right?

1565
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:49,260
No, it's not a hundred.

1566
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:50,700
It's like a thousand, right?

1567
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:53,580
It's like a thousand millimeters.

1568
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:54,960
It's a thousand millimeters?

1569
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:56,760
Please, Teddy.

1570
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,540
You can't do this to me.

1571
01:10:59,140 --> 01:11:02,340
Is it a thousand millimeters in a meter?

1572
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:03,360
Or is it...

1573
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:06,480
Like...

1574
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,260
A thousand, right?

1575
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:11,820
So it'd be three thousand and...

1576
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:12,980
How much is three quarters?

1577
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:14,420
That's three fourths.

1578
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:15,560
So it's almost...

1579
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:18,680
It's like three thousand seven fifty, right?

1580
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:21,920
Because three quarters is like three fourths.

1581
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:22,460
And like...

1582
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:25,980
Quarters is like 25.50.75 a dollar.

1583
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:28,720
Because we have the 25 cents in Canada.

1584
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:31,700
So if there's a thousand...

1585
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:33,160
It can't be a hundred millimeters.

1586
01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:34,060
It's like mili.

1587
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:35,760
So if there's...

1588
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:40,060
If it's three fourths and we do three fourths with quarters...

1589
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:42,040
Because four quarters equals one dollar.

1590
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:45,480
Then three quarters equals 75 cents.

1591
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,260
There should be 750.

1592
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:49,200
So I'm locking it in.

1593
01:11:49,780 --> 01:11:51,640
I'm locking it in.

1594
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:56,680
I don't know where my logic is.

1595
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:58,860
It's not beavers.

1596
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:01,220
It's a fucking moose, you idiot.

1597
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:07,600
Fucking Americans don't even know the quarter has a moose on it.

1598
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:09,020
The quarter is...

1599
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,040
Wait, I did it!

1600
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:14,120
Oh my god!

1601
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,000
I did it.

1602
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:18,580
I did it.

1603
01:12:20,860 --> 01:12:23,820
Guys, I don't know what the killer crab is.

1604
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,660
Guys, I need you guys to know...

1605
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:33,000
For 10 years of my life, I was in an American international school.

1606
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:41,360
And in the first 10 years, I was in a Canadian school till middle school.

1607
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:47,500
And then middle school to end of high school was an American international school.

1608
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:51,740
So like, I don't know what a kilogram is.

1609
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:58,960
I don't know.

1610
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:06,040
My measurements are so fucked up.

1611
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:12,220
Okay, chemistry and measurement.

1612
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:14,900
Where were you when I needed you, Eli?

1613
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:17,900
Where the fuck were you?

1614
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:21,320
VTubing rotted her brain.

1615
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:23,580
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

1616
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:24,160
Thank you.

1617
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:25,860
Thank you so much.

1618
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:26,980
Thank you for the super chat.

1619
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:27,440
Thank you.

1620
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:28,160
Thank you.

1621
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:29,680
Sounds like cope.

1622
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:30,500
Okay.

1623
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:31,720
All right.

1624
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:32,680
What was this thing?

1625
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:36,460
You know what?

1626
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:38,380
Vocabulary has never failed...

1627
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:39,860
Has never failed me.

1628
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:46,180
Yes?

1629
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:58,540
It's your chance to answer.

1630
01:13:58,780 --> 01:14:05,680
It's like superlatives is like most likely to succeed and stuff like that.

1631
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:10,060
Like it's like most of something because it's super.

1632
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:14,200
So it's true because like that's what you do when you graduate in high school.

1633
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:16,340
It's like most likely to become an actor.

1634
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:18,560
Most likely to succeed.

1635
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:22,280
It's like, yeah, the most of something.

1636
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:28,640
So it has to be coldest because you can be like most cold area.

1637
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:29,660
Most cold.

1638
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,600
No, I don't fucking need to eat.

1639
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:33,120
Like you're not good at both.

1640
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:34,740
You're a science nerd.

1641
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:35,720
Okay.

1642
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:36,880
It has to be true.

1643
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,020
It has to be true.

1644
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:44,840
Because you can't be like the more cold person.

1645
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:47,240
Most likely to be cold.

1646
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:48,940
Oh, thank God.

1647
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:50,560
Oh my God.

1648
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,360
Thank fucking God.

1649
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:56,900
Here we go.

1650
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:01,720
Yeah, well give us a fun fact, Eli.

1651
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:11,220
If only you could tell me what fish produces mercury.

1652
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:14,560
Like...

1653
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:16,400
I still don't...

1654
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:19,300
I learned today that fish...

1655
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:23,000
Fucking eating more of a certain type of fish gives you mercury poisoning.

1656
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:25,560
Like, it took me so long to learn that.

1657
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:28,160
And salmon is one of the fishes.

1658
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:29,380
Like, what?

1659
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:30,120
How is salmon...

1660
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:33,340
I have smoked salmon in my fridge.

1661
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:43,500
Well, I have smoked salmon in my fridge right now.

1662
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:45,880
Oh, no.

1663
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:49,800
I think I'm gonna die.

1664
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:51,380
What was it?

1665
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:52,940
Measurements.

1666
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:55,840
Um...

1667
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,460
No, I'm not gonna use Eli.

1668
01:15:57,780 --> 01:15:58,500
I'm not...

1669
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,800
I need to get out of here.

1670
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:01,560
I...

1671
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:04,700
I need to get out of here.

1672
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,620
I'll use help at fifth grade.

1673
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:14,420
Exaggeration.

1674
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:17,740
Alliteration.

1675
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:19,760
Hyperbole.

1676
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:21,020
Oh, hyperbole!

1677
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:21,700
Palindrome.

1678
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:23,560
Hyperbole!

1679
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:27,900
I don't know what the fuck a palindrome is, but like, I know it's not alliteration.

1680
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:29,760
So it has to be a hyperbole.

1681
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,580
The fuck is a palindrome?

1682
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:36,620
Well, the actual answer is...

1683
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:40,220
Hyperbole.

1684
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:40,840
Yeah!

1685
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:47,060
I can't believe vocabulary is my best subject.

1686
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:53,080
I can't believe...

1687
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:56,620
Vocabulary should not be my best subject and yet... No, it is!

1688
01:16:56,820 --> 01:17:04,440
Guys, I don't know if you guys know this, but when I did the PSAT, I had the highest... I had the highest reading...

1689
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:06,460
Reading and voc... What was it?

1690
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:07,200
It wasn't a PSAT.

1691
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:09,540
It was like reading and vocab or whatever.

1692
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:11,080
It was two subjects.

1693
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:12,980
It was like reading and uh...

1694
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:15,860
What was the other one in the SAT?

1695
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:19,600
So, let's greet your new classmate.

1696
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:20,460
Comprehension.

1697
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:21,680
Wait, is it reading comprehension?

1698
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:22,300
Verbal.

1699
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:22,580
Yeah.

1700
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:24,020
Uh, reading and writing.

1701
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:28,360
I had the highest PSAT score in my... in my grade.

1702
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,760
So in my grade for... not grade.

1703
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:34,280
In my school for reading and writing.

1704
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:35,920
I don't know what happened.

1705
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:42,440
I don't... How did I know?

1706
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:46,500
Because the um... the... the life counselor...

1707
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:55,640
Um, the life counselor took me and this other girl who had the highest math score in the PSAT in the grade.

1708
01:17:55,940 --> 01:18:01,760
And then like... and they took me and this other girl and was like congratulating us and was like congratulations.

1709
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:05,240
You two... you two had like the highest score for your categories.

1710
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,220
I don't know what happened after.

1711
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,100
I don't know what happened to me after though.

1712
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:09,660
Like...

1713
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:15,640
I don't know what happened to me.

1714
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:19,500
Like and then that's where I peaked guys.

1715
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:23,500
That's... that's exactly where I peaked in life.

1716
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:25,420
Okay, reading.

1717
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:29,640
What happened?

1718
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:32,640
Honestly, I can blame the mercury.

1719
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:34,640
Oh my god.

1720
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:35,540
Wait, I know this.

1721
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:39,680
Wait, I don't know this.

1722
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:41,720
Is it Nathaniel?

1723
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:43,180
Mark Twain!

1724
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:45,820
Mark Twain and the Adventures of Tom Sawyer.

1725
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,580
I know this from The Simpsons.

1726
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:48,880
It's Mark Twain.

1727
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,140
It's Mark Twain.

1728
01:18:50,380 --> 01:18:51,900
I know this from The Simpsons.

1729
01:18:54,180 --> 01:19:00,260
It's Twain because like The Simpsons did a parody of it and then they talked about Mark Twain.

1730
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:04,980
Thank you TV!

1731
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:05,220
TV!

1732
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:14,380
Never... when your teachers tell you that TV's gonna rot your brain, tell them a VTuber got past fourth grade.

1733
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:16,440
Because of The Simpsons.

1734
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:21,220
Fucking nerd.

1735
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:24,020
See, that's a fun fact.

1736
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:25,780
Wait, that's not even a fact.

1737
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:26,940
That's just a hobby.

1738
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:28,880
All right, social sex.

1739
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:30,520
We are not doing these.

1740
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:33,040
We're getting social sex this week.

1741
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,900
That's not even a fact.

1742
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,200
That's just a hobby.

1743
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:38,200
Hayley.

1744
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:45,480
How's this social sciences?

1745
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:48,720
That's just history.

1746
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:52,200
Oh my god!

1747
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:53,100
Okay.

1748
01:19:58,160 --> 01:19:58,620
Okay.

1749
01:19:58,620 --> 01:19:58,680
Okay.

1750
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:02,440
It's time to ask the class.

1751
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:03,680
All right, class.

1752
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:06,020
Where the fuck is that located?

1753
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:15,600
Oh my god.

1754
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:24,100
I don't know any... I only recognize Texas and Florida and Alaska and Hawaii on this fucking map.

1755
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:29,420
Where's that?

1756
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:33,160
Where the fuck is that?

1757
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,020
Is that New York?

1758
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:41,720
Is that Pennsylvania?

1759
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:43,380
Sorry, Pennsylvania?

1760
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:49,520
Okay, okay, it's below New York.

1761
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,220
If it's below New York, then that has to be...

1762
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:55,540
It's all New York.

1763
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:58,120
Is this... Is this Pennsylvania?

1764
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:10,590
Is that... Is that Pennsylvania?

1765
01:21:10,930 --> 01:21:11,910
I can't tell.

1766
01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:16,270
All right, Penn State, let's go.

1767
01:21:16,790 --> 01:21:17,270
Don't worry.

1768
01:21:17,610 --> 01:21:18,770
Take as long as you need.

1769
01:21:20,170 --> 01:21:20,630
All right.

1770
01:21:22,230 --> 01:21:25,970
The actual answer is Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.

1771
01:21:26,530 --> 01:21:27,570
Oh, thank god.

1772
01:21:27,730 --> 01:21:28,310
Did I get it?

1773
01:21:28,390 --> 01:21:29,290
Oh, I couldn't tell.

1774
01:21:29,630 --> 01:21:30,710
Okay, we got it.

1775
01:21:30,710 --> 01:21:31,770
We got Pennsylvania.

1776
01:21:34,690 --> 01:21:35,650
Am I...

1777
01:21:37,070 --> 01:21:37,550
Unfortunately,

1778
01:21:44,090 --> 01:21:48,470
you were not smarter than a fifth grader, but we'd love to see you here later.

1779
01:21:49,570 --> 01:21:52,350
Let's take a last look at the final scores.

1780
01:21:52,350 --> 01:21:55,430
You did great, but there's always more to learn.

1781
01:21:55,890 --> 01:21:58,110
When did this become GeoGuessr?

1782
01:21:58,430 --> 01:22:02,770
When did this... I... Oh my god, I was in Pennsylva...

1783
01:22:03,230 --> 01:22:05,490
I was in Pennsylvania.

1784
01:22:07,690 --> 01:22:11,790
I was actually in Pennsylvania.

1785
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:20,590
How was I supposed to know that was part of the system?

1786
01:22:21,230 --> 01:22:23,970
Like, I was playing fucking GeoGuessr.

1787
01:22:24,190 --> 01:22:26,390
Like, why am I playing GeoGuessr?

1788
01:22:26,690 --> 01:22:28,490
Like, I don't understand.

1789
01:22:38,230 --> 01:22:39,330
This is it.

1790
01:22:39,790 --> 01:22:41,550
I... Oh my god, this is it.

1791
01:22:41,770 --> 01:22:45,070
I... Oh, oh, oh, this is it.

1792
01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:50,350
This is it.

1793
01:22:50,350 --> 01:22:50,990
Where is it?

1794
01:22:52,210 --> 01:22:54,870
Where... where is it?

1795
01:22:57,490 --> 01:23:01,650
I know there's this... I know that setting is in here somewhere.

1796
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:08,790
Okay, all right, I'm fine.

1797
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:10,790
I'm... I'm... I...

1798
01:23:10,790 --> 01:23:14,090
I've had enough.

1799
01:23:14,610 --> 01:23:15,150
I've...

1800
01:23:15,150 --> 01:23:17,630
I've had enough.

1801
01:23:19,190 --> 01:23:20,670
I've had enough.

1802
01:23:25,070 --> 01:23:27,950
I can't... I can't think.

1803
01:23:27,970 --> 01:23:30,630
I keep giving me geography questions.

1804
01:23:31,130 --> 01:23:33,550
After the Gettysburg, I'm...

1805
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:36,070
I'm fucking... I snapped the U.S.

1806
01:23:36,090 --> 01:23:36,850
out of existence.

1807
01:23:39,670 --> 01:23:44,010
I... I... I fucking got rid of the United States.

1808
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:48,890
I'm fucking... It's gone.

1809
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:50,110
The country's gone.

1810
01:23:54,290 --> 01:24:00,130
At least I knew... I knew, like... I knew it was Turkey.

1811
01:24:02,970 --> 01:24:05,510
That was actually bullshit.

1812
01:24:10,910 --> 01:24:12,110
All right.

1813
01:24:12,470 --> 01:24:14,070
Okay, we can do it.

1814
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:19,490
Okay, there's... there's no way we can fuck it up now.

1815
01:24:22,950 --> 01:24:25,330
Kanna's taking back Alaska today.

1816
01:24:25,950 --> 01:24:28,370
We're gonna take back Alaska.

1817
01:24:32,030 --> 01:24:34,150
All right, Hayley, I don't need your help.

1818
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:35,430
It's literally the first grade.

1819
01:24:35,950 --> 01:24:37,250
All right, spelling.

1820
01:24:37,250 --> 01:24:39,050
It's first grade spelling.

1821
01:24:39,390 --> 01:24:41,710
It's first grade.

1822
01:24:46,630 --> 01:24:47,510
C?

1823
01:25:04,030 --> 01:25:05,250
What's a consonant?

1824
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:13,500
Wait, what's a consonant, chat?

1825
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:23,120
Oh, it's not a vowel.

1826
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:26,540
It's D.

1827
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:28,360
Guys, guys, guys.

1828
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:32,280
First... okay, guys, guys.

1829
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:33,680
Like...

1830
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:35,960
This is not cheating, guys.

1831
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,460
Guys, it's not cheating.

1832
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:41,020
I just... I just needed, like, clarification, guys.

1833
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:42,240
It's not cheating.

1834
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:45,400
I just need to know what the fuck a consonant is.

1835
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:51,280
Guys, it's been many years since first grade.

1836
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:53,920
How would you explain this?

1837
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:57,080
When will you ever need consonants in real life?

1838
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:06,980
You see, Hayley?

1839
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,940
That's a fun fact, Hayley.

1840
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:12,180
You gotta keep it light-hearted.

1841
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:14,240
I thought that was so fun.

1842
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,880
That's so fun learning that fact.

1843
01:26:18,980 --> 01:26:21,800
Vowels are, like, easier to know than...

1844
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,500
Vowels are more...

1845
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:26,700
Vowels are more an intuitive thing versus consonant.

1846
01:26:26,980 --> 01:26:30,120
Because you need vowels in many, many places.

1847
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:33,280
But you don't need to learn what consonants are.

1848
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:37,480
Because if you know what a vowel is, you don't need to know what consonants are.

1849
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:45,920
You don't need to know what a consonant is if you know what a vowel is.

1850
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:49,360
That's all I'm saying.

1851
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:55,600
That's true.

1852
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:56,660
Yeah.

1853
01:26:58,340 --> 01:26:59,660
That's a Venus flytrap.

1854
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:00,820
Like, what else does it do?

1855
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:03,100
It's true.

1856
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:07,460
I watched the horror... What was it?

1857
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:13,160
The, um, that musical where the Venus flytrap eats people?

1858
01:27:14,220 --> 01:27:14,960
Pet Shop of Horrors!

1859
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,720
I know Pet Shop of Horrors.

1860
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:23,380
There's actually a YouTube channel that does shorts with Venus flytraps and he talks about all the different... or Little Shop of Horrors.

1861
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:23,760
Yeah.

1862
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:32,420
And he talks about, like, how different species of flytraps kill insects because there's not more than one.

1863
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:40,000
Guys, I mean, guys, this is it.

1864
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:43,400
This is the... this is where... this just took longer than I expected.

1865
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:44,560
This...

1866
01:27:46,820 --> 01:27:49,140
This took so... this is taking...

1867
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:52,740
This is taking so long.

1868
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:56,080
I thought I would be done by this game by now.

1869
01:27:56,140 --> 01:27:58,660
I might still not pass fifth grade.

1870
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:06,340
We got fucked over by hippest hoppest happest, like...

1871
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:09,220
Um...

1872
01:28:09,220 --> 01:28:11,400
Fucking hippest hoppest happest.

1873
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:12,540
That's fucking horror.

1874
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:16,120
Vocabulary.

1875
01:28:18,980 --> 01:28:20,600
How are you an IB student?

1876
01:28:21,020 --> 01:28:23,860
When will you ever learn hippest hoppest happest?

1877
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:28,940
Which of the following would he most likely use to help navigate?

1878
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:33,340
Microscope.

1879
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:34,180
Periscope.

1880
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:36,100
Telescope.

1881
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:40,500
Nuclear gamer.

1882
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:42,040
Do you have the answer?

1883
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:44,020
Isn't it sonar?

1884
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:49,460
The... I'm assuming microscope and telescope is not it.

1885
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:55,460
I don't know what the fuck is a periscope, but I know it's not microscope or telescope.

1886
01:28:55,680 --> 01:29:02,600
So with the process of elimination, because this is for bacteria and this is for the fucking space.

1887
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:03,900
Or being a creep.

1888
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:07,000
So it has to be periscope, whatever the fuck that is.

1889
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:10,140
We got your answer.

1890
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:11,100
Yay!

1891
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:16,080
I saw 100% true facts about the Venus flytrap.

1892
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:17,640
Also, shout out to Z Frank.

1893
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:19,100
Thank you for the super chat, Gary.

1894
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:20,200
Thank you, thank you.

1895
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:21,680
Oh my god, I did it!

1896
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:22,940
Process of elimination.

1897
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:25,620
That's how I aced the PSAT.

1898
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:31,220
If I didn't know what the question answer was, I know what the wrong answers were.

1899
01:29:33,140 --> 01:29:37,300
The dust from the Sahara often fertilizes the Amazon through wind.

1900
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:38,380
What a good fact.

1901
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:40,900
That's a good fact, too.

1902
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:41,240
Yeah.

1903
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:43,260
What a fun fact.

1904
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:45,360
Did you know the Sahara Desert got flooded?

1905
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:48,760
We've got...

1906
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:49,680
Like, recently?

1907
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:54,360
We are avoiding these two, like, there's no way.

1908
01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:01,000
Guys, we gotta finish this game eventually.

1909
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:05,000
We know our fucking strong suits.

1910
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,520
Which advance the ability to translate from several languages.

1911
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:11,020
Rosetta?

1912
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:15,000
Nuclear gamer picked the right answer.

1913
01:30:15,220 --> 01:30:15,820
The fuck?

1914
01:30:19,970 --> 01:30:23,190
I'm not even given a multiple choice?

1915
01:30:23,310 --> 01:30:24,990
I'm just chucked in?

1916
01:30:25,250 --> 01:30:27,430
I assume it's in Europe, right?

1917
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,700
Like, maybe the Romans?

1918
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:36,280
Where the fuck does the...

1919
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:38,300
What is the Rosetta Stone?

1920
01:30:39,460 --> 01:30:40,420
Okay, wait.

1921
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:41,860
Ask my classmate.

1922
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:49,700
What grade am I in right now?

1923
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:50,820
I'm in the second grade?

1924
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:52,120
The fuck?

1925
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:55,260
Why would you teach the second graders about the Rosetta Stone?

1926
01:30:58,700 --> 01:31:00,020
Oh my god, okay.

1927
01:31:02,780 --> 01:31:03,260
Okay.

1928
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:03,440
Okay.

1929
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:06,820
I don't know.

1930
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:09,280
All I can think about is, like, the Romans?

1931
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:10,720
Like, I...

1932
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:13,260
Because it's important?

1933
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:20,360
Oh my god, don't be a fucking smartass right now, Kai.

1934
01:31:20,820 --> 01:31:21,720
Don't be...

1935
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:25,940
Don't be...

1936
01:31:25,940 --> 01:31:28,880
Don't be a smartass right now, guys.

1937
01:31:29,020 --> 01:31:30,300
Oh my god, phone a chat!

1938
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:31,960
Thank you, Vamp Cinder.

1939
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:33,540
Now, where is Egypt?

1940
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:34,300
Is it this?

1941
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:35,020
Is this Egypt?

1942
01:31:35,820 --> 01:31:37,140
It's the one connecting, right?

1943
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:39,200
Guys, it's not cheating.

1944
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:40,720
I used phone a chat.

1945
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:46,060
Guys.

1946
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,260
Guys, it's not cheating, guys.

1947
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:50,500
Phone a chat.

1948
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:56,100
Phone a chat is a real thing, guys.

1949
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:57,240
Is this Egypt?

1950
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:01,540
This is Egypt?

1951
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:04,590
Wait, Egypt is this big?

1952
01:32:08,540 --> 01:32:09,680
Oh my god.

1953
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:12,560
I didn't realize Egypt was actually this big.

1954
01:32:14,460 --> 01:32:16,200
That's a huge...

1955
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:16,940
That's huge.

1956
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:24,360
I get to use one phone a chat.

1957
01:32:24,580 --> 01:32:26,440
That's my phone a chat, guys.

1958
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:32,890
As a streamer, I have an additional option to phone a chat.

1959
01:32:33,290 --> 01:32:36,110
And it was a geography question.

1960
01:32:36,610 --> 01:32:38,210
So I should be allowed.

1961
01:32:38,430 --> 01:32:39,230
I have one.

1962
01:32:39,370 --> 01:32:41,750
It's like how all the other ones I had one.

1963
01:32:42,050 --> 01:32:44,310
This is my one phone a chat, guys.

1964
01:32:44,830 --> 01:32:47,330
This is my one phone a chat.

1965
01:32:47,530 --> 01:32:48,330
I get one.

1966
01:32:50,290 --> 01:32:52,590
Literally the one time I used it.

1967
01:32:52,890 --> 01:32:53,790
No, no, no.

1968
01:32:54,290 --> 01:32:55,590
This is one.

1969
01:32:56,150 --> 01:32:57,890
This is my one.

1970
01:33:01,510 --> 01:33:02,550
Guys, it's over.

1971
01:33:02,730 --> 01:33:03,530
This is my one.

1972
01:33:07,970 --> 01:33:09,270
Dr. S.

1973
01:33:09,790 --> 01:33:10,350
Shenanigans.

1974
01:33:10,830 --> 01:33:12,550
Thank you for the super chat.

1975
01:33:13,050 --> 01:33:13,070
Thank you.

1976
01:33:14,430 --> 01:33:15,810
I'm in third grade.

1977
01:33:16,810 --> 01:33:19,030
Please, I just want to get to the...

1978
01:33:19,030 --> 01:33:20,970
Please, get me out of here.

1979
01:33:24,190 --> 01:33:26,630
Get me out of this school.

1980
01:33:27,610 --> 01:33:28,170
Please.

1981
01:33:31,710 --> 01:33:33,550
Okay, we're not gonna...

1982
01:33:33,550 --> 01:33:35,110
Which one was geography, guys?

1983
01:33:38,730 --> 01:33:39,910
Oh, shit.

1984
01:33:40,010 --> 01:33:41,170
When did we get vocabulary?

1985
01:33:42,970 --> 01:33:44,530
Wait, foreign languages.

1986
01:33:44,730 --> 01:33:46,950
Wait, I do foreign languages.

1987
01:33:48,150 --> 01:33:49,830
I do foreign languages.

1988
01:33:50,290 --> 01:33:51,270
That's not difficult.

1989
01:33:55,070 --> 01:33:56,130
Oh, Fiesta!

1990
01:33:57,550 --> 01:33:58,830
Let's go!

1991
01:33:58,830 --> 01:34:01,170
Let's have a Fiesta.

1992
01:34:01,530 --> 01:34:02,510
It's not Swahili.

1993
01:34:04,970 --> 01:34:07,170
That's not fucking Urdu, Swahili.

1994
01:34:08,030 --> 01:34:08,630
The fuck?

1995
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:11,610
Yay!

1996
01:34:12,550 --> 01:34:13,350
Fiesta.

1997
01:34:13,810 --> 01:34:15,390
What the fuck is Urdu?

1998
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:19,010
I know it's not Swahili.

1999
01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:20,770
I don't know where Urdu is.

2000
01:34:21,150 --> 01:34:23,790
It has to be Spanish.

2001
01:34:24,470 --> 01:34:26,750
My good old Espanol.

2002
01:34:27,610 --> 01:34:28,770
Let's go!

2003
01:34:29,570 --> 01:34:30,610
Shadow was right.

2004
01:34:32,410 --> 01:34:33,850
Let's go, Shadow!

2005
01:34:34,810 --> 01:34:36,650
My buddy, Shadow.

2006
01:34:39,530 --> 01:34:40,750
Oh, is Urdu...

2007
01:34:41,310 --> 01:34:42,590
Urdu, like, in...

2008
01:34:42,590 --> 01:34:43,830
Oh, it's in India?

2009
01:34:45,850 --> 01:34:48,010
Oh, it's India and Pakistan.

2010
01:34:48,270 --> 01:34:49,690
I have no idea.

2011
01:34:49,950 --> 01:34:51,010
Well, now I'm learning!

2012
01:34:52,630 --> 01:34:54,370
Hello, my fellow amigos!

2013
01:34:56,750 --> 01:34:58,990
Can you tell us a nice fact about yourself?

2014
01:34:59,930 --> 01:35:02,610
I'm currently reading Spanish epic poetry.

2015
01:35:02,850 --> 01:35:04,670
Oh my god, he could have actually helped me.

2016
01:35:04,790 --> 01:35:06,610
It's now time for the next question.

2017
01:35:09,070 --> 01:35:10,190
Nuclear Gamer.

2018
01:35:10,570 --> 01:35:12,210
Go and pick one of these subjects.

2019
01:35:12,590 --> 01:35:18,410
Oh my god, we keep doing foreign languages, but I've been acing life sciences, though.

2020
01:35:19,090 --> 01:35:20,950
Alright, do we do foreign language or...

2021
01:35:20,950 --> 01:35:32,030
Honestly, I've been acing foreign... I've been acing life sciences, but, like, foreign language is newer, so, like, we get other questions, too, so I'm gonna... Guys, we know our strong suit.

2022
01:35:36,310 --> 01:35:36,910
Alright.

2023
01:35:37,370 --> 01:35:40,310
What was the original language used in ancient Rome?

2024
01:35:42,510 --> 01:35:43,110
Latin.

2025
01:35:43,530 --> 01:35:44,090
Latin?

2026
01:35:44,550 --> 01:35:45,050
Italian.

2027
01:35:45,630 --> 01:35:46,630
Okay, it's not Italian.

2028
01:35:46,990 --> 01:35:46,990
Greek.

2029
01:35:49,330 --> 01:35:50,330
It's Latin.

2030
01:35:50,470 --> 01:35:51,450
Nuclear Gamer.

2031
01:35:51,570 --> 01:35:51,910
Or Greek.

2032
01:35:51,950 --> 01:35:52,570
Choose an answer.

2033
01:35:53,390 --> 01:35:54,590
It's Latin or Greek.

2034
01:35:55,230 --> 01:35:56,490
Is that Latin or Greek?

2035
01:35:56,570 --> 01:35:58,910
And I think it's Latin, because that's, like, my first...

2036
01:35:58,910 --> 01:36:00,610
Like, it's, like, my first instant...

2037
01:36:00,610 --> 01:36:01,510
It has to be Latin.

2038
01:36:02,430 --> 01:36:03,290
It has to be.

2039
01:36:03,910 --> 01:36:04,910
There's no way.

2040
01:36:05,070 --> 01:36:06,710
It's... I know it's not Italian.

2041
01:36:07,450 --> 01:36:12,290
But, like, it has to be... That has to be the original language, because it's, like...

2042
01:36:12,290 --> 01:36:14,130
Everything was always... It came from Latin.

2043
01:36:17,050 --> 01:36:18,510
It has to be Latin.

2044
01:36:24,590 --> 01:36:26,590
The answer is...

2045
01:36:28,210 --> 01:36:28,650
Latin.

2046
01:36:28,850 --> 01:36:29,670
Oh, thank God.

2047
01:36:31,050 --> 01:36:32,630
Oh, thank God.

2048
01:36:32,690 --> 01:36:38,830
Because I know, like, the Romans stole, like, copied Greek for everything, so I was, like...

2049
01:36:38,830 --> 01:36:40,330
Oh, thank God.

2050
01:36:40,590 --> 01:36:41,570
Oh, I went with my gut.

2051
01:36:41,730 --> 01:36:42,330
I was, like...

2052
01:36:42,330 --> 01:36:50,050
I was second guessing myself, because I was, like... Well, they, like, steal stuff from the Greek, so I was, like... Oh, my God.

2053
01:36:50,050 --> 01:36:50,330
Like...

2054
01:36:53,230 --> 01:36:53,710
So...

2055
01:36:55,070 --> 01:36:56,430
So, like, I was, like...

2056
01:36:56,430 --> 01:36:58,690
Oh, what if they stole Greek language, too?

2057
01:36:58,890 --> 01:36:59,010
Yeah.

2058
01:36:59,350 --> 01:37:01,250
They stole everything from the Greek.

2059
01:37:01,290 --> 01:37:02,590
Almost everything from the Greek.

2060
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:05,890
So what if they also stole Greek from the Greeks?

2061
01:37:09,690 --> 01:37:10,870
I'm doubting myself.

2062
01:37:10,970 --> 01:37:11,690
Oh, look.

2063
01:37:11,930 --> 01:37:14,990
I've never had my self-esteem be crushed by this game.

2064
01:37:21,330 --> 01:37:22,050
Wait.

2065
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:22,830
Wait.

2066
01:37:23,790 --> 01:37:28,850
I've never felt, like, my ego and self-esteem get crushed this high.

2067
01:37:29,670 --> 01:37:31,430
Alright, life sciences, let's go!

2068
01:37:31,430 --> 01:37:34,750
Let's see what you can grow in this plants question.

2069
01:37:37,750 --> 01:37:38,590
True or false?

2070
01:37:39,230 --> 01:37:44,810
Giant sequoia trees grow until they're around 2,000 years old and then stop growing.

2071
01:37:50,770 --> 01:37:52,550
Choose your answer.

2072
01:37:59,230 --> 01:38:00,750
Oh, I...

2073
01:38:02,470 --> 01:38:04,030
Fuck, we still have those?

2074
01:38:04,030 --> 01:38:05,050
We still...

2075
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:10,450
This is technically measurements.

2076
01:38:10,670 --> 01:38:11,230
That's cheating.

2077
01:38:13,830 --> 01:38:16,210
That's literally cheating.

2078
01:38:16,570 --> 01:38:18,110
This is technically...

2079
01:38:18,110 --> 01:38:20,250
This is technically measurements.

2080
01:38:24,030 --> 01:38:26,670
I assume false?

2081
01:38:27,910 --> 01:38:30,030
Because, like...

2082
01:38:30,610 --> 01:38:32,450
I don't know, like...

2083
01:38:32,450 --> 01:38:34,790
There's a tree out there that's...

2084
01:38:34,790 --> 01:38:38,030
That's, like, thousands of years old and it's giant.

2085
01:38:38,310 --> 01:38:39,210
It's fucking huge.

2086
01:38:39,310 --> 01:38:40,870
I assume that's the tree.

2087
01:38:41,530 --> 01:38:42,910
Like, how do they know?

2088
01:38:43,390 --> 01:38:50,110
Okay, the one thing that makes me think it's weird is that how do they know it's 2,000 years old?

2089
01:38:50,630 --> 01:38:51,990
That's when they stop growing.

2090
01:38:52,070 --> 01:38:53,430
Because they gotta cut the tree.

2091
01:38:54,310 --> 01:38:55,910
Shut the fuck up, Halima!

2092
01:38:56,070 --> 01:38:57,410
I'm trying to think!

2093
01:38:57,830 --> 01:38:59,470
I did not ask.

2094
01:38:59,470 --> 01:39:01,950
I've been stuck in, like, fourth grade.

2095
01:39:02,130 --> 01:39:05,990
I've been stuck in, like, fifth grade peak for an hour and 30 minutes now, Halima.

2096
01:39:07,570 --> 01:39:09,150
I need... Just shut up.

2097
01:39:09,190 --> 01:39:09,850
I'm trying to think.

2098
01:39:10,130 --> 01:39:11,150
Okay, anyway.

2099
01:39:11,470 --> 01:39:15,150
So, like, I'm just thinking, like, you gotta cut the tree to tell how old they are.

2100
01:39:15,430 --> 01:39:17,370
So, did they cut several trees?

2101
01:39:17,590 --> 01:39:19,450
And they're all, like, 2,000?

2102
01:39:20,270 --> 01:39:22,130
But, like, then they cut down a tree.

2103
01:39:22,170 --> 01:39:22,910
How would they know?

2104
01:39:23,510 --> 01:39:24,850
Like, why is it so...

2105
01:39:24,850 --> 01:39:26,150
Just shut up!

2106
01:39:28,210 --> 01:39:31,010
I'm trying to mull it along!

2107
01:39:31,670 --> 01:39:33,290
Okay, I'm gonna say false.

2108
01:39:33,530 --> 01:39:38,150
Because I'm thinking, like, there's no way, like, um...

2109
01:39:38,850 --> 01:39:42,250
I feel like 2,000 is just so specific.

2110
01:39:42,930 --> 01:39:47,670
Like, it just feels way too... I'm sorry.

2111
01:39:47,910 --> 01:39:49,750
I did not mean to yell at you, Halima.

2112
01:39:49,830 --> 01:39:51,310
I'm very stressed out right now.

2113
01:39:51,390 --> 01:39:52,310
Like, I gotta...

2114
01:39:52,310 --> 01:39:54,150
I swear, I feel like I...

2115
01:39:54,150 --> 01:39:58,250
I feel like I repeated the fourth grade, like, seven times.

2116
01:39:58,490 --> 01:39:59,430
Halima, it's not you.

2117
01:39:59,630 --> 01:40:01,790
I'm just on the edge right now, Halima.

2118
01:40:02,210 --> 01:40:03,450
I'm on the edge.

2119
01:40:03,510 --> 01:40:06,350
I've been repeating the fourth grade, like, seven times.

2120
01:40:07,550 --> 01:40:08,070
Like...

2121
01:40:12,690 --> 01:40:14,050
Oh my god.

2122
01:40:14,130 --> 01:40:17,110
This is the best... I don't wanna use... Okay.

2123
01:40:17,770 --> 01:40:18,990
I don't know.

2124
01:40:19,230 --> 01:40:19,750
I want...

2125
01:40:19,750 --> 01:40:21,090
This has to be the game.

2126
01:40:21,210 --> 01:40:21,990
I'm cheating.

2127
01:40:21,990 --> 01:40:22,830
I can't.

2128
01:40:23,830 --> 01:40:24,310
Okay.

2129
01:40:24,570 --> 01:40:24,890
Alright.

2130
01:40:25,130 --> 01:40:26,630
What did you say, Halima?

2131
01:40:29,830 --> 01:40:30,790
I can't.

2132
01:40:30,970 --> 01:40:31,350
I...

2133
01:40:32,570 --> 01:40:34,410
I'm doubting myself now.

2134
01:40:34,550 --> 01:40:35,670
I don't know.

2135
01:40:35,750 --> 01:40:37,770
I'm like, what if it is 2,000?

2136
01:40:37,910 --> 01:40:39,110
I was gonna pick false.

2137
01:40:39,790 --> 01:40:41,150
It has to be false, right?

2138
01:40:41,230 --> 01:40:42,230
Is it false, Halima?

2139
01:40:43,930 --> 01:40:44,890
Is it false?

2140
01:40:51,990 --> 01:40:53,990
The answer is...

2141
01:40:55,370 --> 01:40:55,970
False.

2142
01:40:56,510 --> 01:40:57,790
Oh my god.

2143
01:40:57,830 --> 01:40:59,110
I should've trusted my gut.

2144
01:40:59,490 --> 01:41:02,250
I should've trusted my gut, man.

2145
01:41:02,450 --> 01:41:09,250
I... Oh, I knew it was false, but then I'm like, it's so... Because it's such a specific answer.

2146
01:41:11,890 --> 01:41:16,350
When I become a doctor, I'm going to volunteer and travel the world.

2147
01:41:16,830 --> 01:41:17,990
With what money?

2148
01:41:19,010 --> 01:41:20,410
With what money?

2149
01:41:20,470 --> 01:41:22,470
You need money for that, Halima?

2150
01:41:23,190 --> 01:41:26,330
It'd be like doctor money, but you're volunteering.

2151
01:41:28,410 --> 01:41:29,510
Okay, foreign language.

2152
01:41:29,690 --> 01:41:31,930
We're not testing social studies.

2153
01:41:32,390 --> 01:41:34,390
Social studies is geography.

2154
01:41:42,590 --> 01:41:43,830
It's spring.

2155
01:41:47,830 --> 01:41:49,070
It has to be spring.

2156
01:41:49,070 --> 01:41:49,270
It has to be spring.

2157
01:41:50,210 --> 01:41:51,650
Because that's where the flowers...

2158
01:41:51,650 --> 01:41:52,770
Wait, which one's spring?

2159
01:41:52,970 --> 01:41:53,810
Is it this one?

2160
01:41:56,190 --> 01:42:01,010
I assumed summer... I know these are summer, fall, winter.

2161
01:42:01,310 --> 01:42:02,530
So I was like, this has to be...

2162
01:42:02,530 --> 01:42:03,550
Why is it green?

2163
01:42:05,530 --> 01:42:08,050
Okay, it has to be spring.

2164
01:42:08,050 --> 01:42:09,270
Because that's where...

2165
01:42:10,030 --> 01:42:11,790
That's where it blossoms.

2166
01:42:28,050 --> 01:42:31,970
I was going to be like, what if it's not spring?

2167
01:42:38,830 --> 01:42:42,310
If I failed that one, that would be so sad.

2168
01:42:42,490 --> 01:42:43,750
The Sakura Blossom.

2169
01:42:46,580 --> 01:42:52,450
I've done Sakura Blossom stuff, so that would be so bad if I failed that.

2170
01:42:55,590 --> 01:42:58,530
What if it's not spring?

2171
01:43:03,170 --> 01:43:07,430
Okay, it's fifth grade.

2172
01:43:07,430 --> 01:43:09,470
Three more, guys!

2173
01:43:09,810 --> 01:43:11,110
Three more!

2174
01:43:13,210 --> 01:43:14,670
Goodbye, Halima.

2175
01:43:20,330 --> 01:43:22,030
Who is it?

2176
01:43:22,610 --> 01:43:24,730
Oh my god, Ava, let's go!

2177
01:43:25,010 --> 01:43:26,910
Ava, you can't disappoint me, right?

2178
01:43:27,970 --> 01:43:30,150
I no longer trust myself.

2179
01:43:39,610 --> 01:43:40,090
Okay.

2180
01:43:42,390 --> 01:43:43,210
Wait, she's good at...

2181
01:43:43,210 --> 01:43:45,070
Oh, I don't have foreign language yet anymore.

2182
01:43:45,630 --> 01:43:46,190
You know what?

2183
01:43:46,550 --> 01:43:48,290
I don't trust myself with reading.

2184
01:43:48,430 --> 01:43:51,130
Like, reading is like, here's a book that you've never read.

2185
01:43:51,450 --> 01:43:54,950
Like, it's a book you've never read.

2186
01:43:55,450 --> 01:43:56,930
I'm just like, I...

2187
01:43:58,330 --> 01:43:58,810
Romania?

2188
01:44:01,190 --> 01:44:02,310
Romania?

2189
01:44:06,110 --> 01:44:09,030
That doesn't even exist.

2190
01:44:10,650 --> 01:44:11,210
Wait.

2191
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:16,970
Bosnia and Herzegovina doesn't even fucking exist.

2192
01:44:18,590 --> 01:44:19,150
Wait.

2193
01:44:20,330 --> 01:44:21,910
Wait, it does?

2194
01:44:22,730 --> 01:44:24,230
Didn't they disband it?

2195
01:44:24,810 --> 01:44:27,530
Wait, Bosnia and Herzegovina is still around?

2196
01:44:27,710 --> 01:44:29,250
I thought they disbanded.

2197
01:44:29,590 --> 01:44:33,390
Wait, am I thinking about a different place?

2198
01:44:34,090 --> 01:44:35,690
Wait, it still does?

2199
01:44:36,270 --> 01:44:36,970
It's...

2200
01:44:38,070 --> 01:44:39,810
I'm so sorry.

2201
01:44:40,370 --> 01:44:41,530
I'm so...

2202
01:44:41,530 --> 01:44:43,190
I was thinking about Yugoslavia.

2203
01:44:43,590 --> 01:44:47,430
I was thinking about Yugoslavia.

2204
01:44:49,610 --> 01:44:50,310
Sorry.

2205
01:44:50,610 --> 01:44:51,930
I did not...

2206
01:44:51,930 --> 01:44:53,490
Sorry, Bosnians.

2207
01:44:54,570 --> 01:44:55,270
Bosnians.

2208
01:44:55,270 --> 01:44:56,970
I did...

2209
01:44:56,970 --> 01:45:00,230
I did not mean to say you're not real.

2210
01:45:00,430 --> 01:45:03,270
I didn't mean to say you weren't real.

2211
01:45:03,570 --> 01:45:04,850
I got confused.

2212
01:45:05,430 --> 01:45:08,390
I got so confused.

2213
01:45:10,370 --> 01:45:11,890
That is offensive.

2214
01:45:12,070 --> 01:45:13,130
We don't exist.

2215
01:45:13,930 --> 01:45:14,630
I'm so sorry.

2216
01:45:15,030 --> 01:45:16,270
You're real to us.

2217
01:45:20,270 --> 01:45:22,750
What the fuck is romance?

2218
01:45:22,750 --> 01:45:23,970
Is it?

2219
01:45:24,650 --> 01:45:30,130
Okay, I don't think it's Bosnia and Herzegovina because like I don't know.

2220
01:45:30,250 --> 01:45:33,030
It doesn't feel like it's a language.

2221
01:45:33,530 --> 01:45:35,450
It's either Romania and Switzerland.

2222
01:45:35,830 --> 01:45:39,050
I want to say Romania because it's romance.

2223
01:45:40,580 --> 01:45:42,430
Because it's like, oh yeah.

2224
01:45:42,630 --> 01:45:43,810
We Romanians here.

2225
01:45:43,970 --> 01:45:46,050
We speak romance.

2226
01:45:47,290 --> 01:45:48,470
We're not keeping time.

2227
01:45:49,490 --> 01:45:53,830
We could be in Switzerland because what the fuck do they speak over there?

2228
01:45:54,930 --> 01:45:55,590
Sorry.

2229
01:45:56,310 --> 01:46:01,530
I'm sorry to all the Swiss goons but what language do you guys speak there?

2230
01:46:01,770 --> 01:46:06,670
I don't even know what languages you guys speak there.

2231
01:46:07,410 --> 01:46:08,090
Like...

2232
01:46:09,410 --> 01:46:13,230
I don't like German is one of them because of Italian.

2233
01:46:17,190 --> 01:46:20,670
But truly what I learned about Europe is from Italia.

2234
01:46:21,170 --> 01:46:26,950
So like I know they speak German because of Italia.

2235
01:46:32,010 --> 01:46:36,670
So it's either Romania or Switzerland.

2236
01:46:38,470 --> 01:46:38,990
Okay.

2237
01:46:41,150 --> 01:46:45,570
They speak Swiss cheese of course.

2238
01:46:45,770 --> 01:46:46,930
Gam, thank you for the super chat.

2239
01:46:46,930 --> 01:46:47,610
Thank you, thank you.

2240
01:46:49,430 --> 01:46:51,150
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

2241
01:46:51,250 --> 01:46:52,210
Thank you, thank you.

2242
01:46:55,030 --> 01:46:55,550
Guys,

2243
01:47:01,670 --> 01:47:03,210
I don't claim Italia anymore.

2244
01:47:03,330 --> 01:47:06,270
Guys, guys, I'm reformed by the way.

2245
01:47:08,230 --> 01:47:09,930
I'm reformed from that.

2246
01:47:10,230 --> 01:47:12,830
I don't look at that past anymore.

2247
01:47:14,050 --> 01:47:14,570
Okay.

2248
01:47:15,390 --> 01:47:16,650
Oh my god.

2249
01:47:16,730 --> 01:47:18,210
I feel like...

2250
01:47:18,210 --> 01:47:19,110
Please.

2251
01:47:20,690 --> 01:47:23,170
I'm making me so nervous right now.

2252
01:47:25,670 --> 01:47:26,190
Okay.

2253
01:47:26,530 --> 01:47:27,030
Well.

2254
01:47:28,470 --> 01:47:29,250
We can't.

2255
01:47:29,250 --> 01:47:29,510
Okay.

2256
01:47:29,850 --> 01:47:32,650
We just need to answer two questions by ourselves.

2257
01:47:33,230 --> 01:47:35,270
Because 6th grade, we get no help.

2258
01:47:35,570 --> 01:47:37,010
So we might as well...

2259
01:47:37,010 --> 01:47:37,810
Oh my god.

2260
01:47:37,850 --> 01:47:38,730
Is it worth it?

2261
01:47:39,070 --> 01:47:40,310
Is it worth to cheat?

2262
01:47:40,630 --> 01:47:43,690
Oh, I feel like I should use the last 5th grade to cheat.

2263
01:47:44,190 --> 01:47:46,090
So it's either Romania or Switzerland.

2264
01:47:46,490 --> 01:47:47,790
I'm gonna flip a coin.

2265
01:47:48,470 --> 01:47:50,290
I'm gonna fucking flip a coin, guys.

2266
01:47:50,890 --> 01:47:52,210
Alright, I'm gonna... Okay.

2267
01:47:52,590 --> 01:47:53,390
Flip a coin.

2268
01:47:54,130 --> 01:47:55,550
Heads, it's Switzerland.

2269
01:47:56,110 --> 01:47:57,450
Tails, it's Romania.

2270
01:47:58,290 --> 01:47:58,850
It's heads.

2271
01:47:58,970 --> 01:47:59,250
Okay.

2272
01:48:02,330 --> 01:48:03,870
We got heads.

2273
01:48:03,990 --> 01:48:04,390
Okay.

2274
01:48:04,910 --> 01:48:05,330
Alright.

2275
01:48:06,030 --> 01:48:08,370
We're relying on heads or tails.

2276
01:48:08,490 --> 01:48:09,350
And we got heads.

2277
01:48:09,390 --> 01:48:09,850
Okay.

2278
01:48:09,850 --> 01:48:10,570
Alright.

2279
01:48:10,790 --> 01:48:12,130
So in the end, it's not...

2280
01:48:12,130 --> 01:48:13,810
If we failed this, it's not me.

2281
01:48:14,070 --> 01:48:15,710
It's literally fake.

2282
01:48:16,210 --> 01:48:17,150
Alright, Switzerland.

2283
01:48:17,890 --> 01:48:18,670
We're gambling.

2284
01:48:18,990 --> 01:48:19,250
Okay.

2285
01:48:20,830 --> 01:48:21,470
Okay.

2286
01:48:23,450 --> 01:48:24,850
Alright, here we go.

2287
01:48:30,170 --> 01:48:31,870
Oh, thank god.

2288
01:48:32,050 --> 01:48:33,810
Thank you for the coin flip.

2289
01:48:34,310 --> 01:48:38,130
Thank you so much for the coin flip.

2290
01:48:44,850 --> 01:48:45,850
Oh my god.

2291
01:48:45,950 --> 01:48:45,990
Oh my god.

2292
01:48:45,990 --> 01:48:47,510
Gambling paid off for once.

2293
01:48:52,070 --> 01:48:53,510
Oh, that's interesting.

2294
01:48:53,930 --> 01:48:57,450
I feel like translating stuff is really stressful in general.

2295
01:48:57,530 --> 01:48:58,430
So I'm not surprised.

2296
01:49:00,290 --> 01:49:01,410
Alright, spelling!

2297
01:49:01,610 --> 01:49:02,190
Let's go!

2298
01:49:05,910 --> 01:49:07,350
Oh my god, let's go!

2299
01:49:07,350 --> 01:49:09,030
Oh, it can't be that bad at spelling.

2300
01:49:09,250 --> 01:49:11,390
Guys, okay, I just needed a little time out there.

2301
01:49:20,670 --> 01:49:21,210
Okay.

2302
01:49:23,030 --> 01:49:23,570
Equipment.

2303
01:49:24,290 --> 01:49:24,790
Yes.

2304
01:49:26,210 --> 01:49:26,630
True.

2305
01:49:27,890 --> 01:49:29,230
I literally spelled it out.

2306
01:49:29,870 --> 01:49:30,830
I typed it out.

2307
01:49:31,050 --> 01:49:31,590
Equipment.

2308
01:49:32,510 --> 01:49:33,630
That has to be true.

2309
01:49:34,150 --> 01:49:38,450
Because like, it's E-Q-U-I-P-T-M Wait.

2310
01:49:39,030 --> 01:49:46,430
E-Q-U-I-P- M-E-N-T I almost spelled Equipment.

2311
01:49:46,930 --> 01:49:47,570
Equipment.

2312
01:49:48,430 --> 01:49:50,310
Unless it is spelled with a T.

2313
01:49:50,850 --> 01:50:03,310
E-Q-U-I-P- T-M-E-N- No, it's spelled with P. E-Q-U-I-P- M-E-N-T Okay, one.

2314
01:50:03,510 --> 01:50:03,930
One T.

2315
01:50:04,930 --> 01:50:06,190
Guys, I'm sorry.

2316
01:50:08,070 --> 01:50:10,150
This game is messing me up.

2317
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:13,830
This game is actually messing me up.

2318
01:50:14,850 --> 01:50:16,170
It's true.

2319
01:50:16,570 --> 01:50:17,210
It's true.

2320
01:50:17,470 --> 01:50:20,330
I'm getting really messed up right now.

2321
01:50:20,770 --> 01:50:21,470
It's true.

2322
01:50:21,810 --> 01:50:22,490
It's true.

2323
01:50:23,150 --> 01:50:23,530
Okay.

2324
01:50:25,350 --> 01:50:27,350
E-Q-U-I-P- M -E-N-T

2325
01:50:30,490 --> 01:50:31,770
E -Q-U-I-P- Oh, thank god.

2326
01:50:31,810 --> 01:50:35,610
I almost thought Equipment was spelled with two Ts for a sect.

2327
01:50:36,050 --> 01:50:44,850
I thought it was E-Q-U-I-P- T-M-E-N-T It almost got fucked over.

2328
01:50:45,990 --> 01:50:48,410
This game makes me...

2329
01:50:48,410 --> 01:50:49,570
Oh, this game.

2330
01:50:49,670 --> 01:50:51,810
This game does things to my brain.

2331
01:50:51,990 --> 01:50:52,870
Oh my god.

2332
01:51:00,010 --> 01:51:00,570
Goodbye.

2333
01:51:01,750 --> 01:51:02,930
Who would've thought?

2334
01:51:03,070 --> 01:51:05,310
We got rid of America and we start winning.

2335
01:51:09,230 --> 01:51:11,170
America no longer exists.

2336
01:51:11,510 --> 01:51:13,890
And then we figure it out how to play the game.

2337
01:51:17,510 --> 01:51:18,070
Okay.

2338
01:51:18,870 --> 01:51:19,750
Alright, vocabulary.

2339
01:51:31,570 --> 01:51:32,970
Okay.

2340
01:51:33,950 --> 01:51:34,970
This is it.

2341
01:51:41,350 --> 01:51:42,050
No.

2342
01:51:43,790 --> 01:51:45,430
S-A...

2343
01:51:45,430 --> 01:51:47,350
S-A-L...

2344
01:51:48,030 --> 01:51:48,950
E...

2345
01:51:48,950 --> 01:51:49,770
Nameless!

2346
01:51:50,370 --> 01:51:52,190
It's nameless!

2347
01:51:53,590 --> 01:51:55,530
It's nameless!

2348
01:51:55,530 --> 01:51:57,530
I know what anagram is!

2349
01:51:59,390 --> 01:52:06,370
I know it's when you rearrange the word and it becomes a different word with the same name!

2350
01:52:07,430 --> 01:52:11,290
Yes, I am smarter than a fifth grader!

2351
01:52:12,230 --> 01:52:14,590
Oh my god!

2352
01:52:16,030 --> 01:52:17,130
Oh me!

2353
01:52:17,550 --> 01:52:18,890
I did it!

2354
01:52:19,190 --> 01:52:20,290
Oh my god.

2355
01:52:21,510 --> 01:52:23,890
Oh, it's not clickbait.

2356
01:52:23,890 --> 01:52:27,210
It was not clickbait.

2357
01:52:27,310 --> 01:52:28,550
Oh my god.

2358
01:52:28,810 --> 01:52:31,890
I told you it wasn't clickbait.

2359
01:52:36,180 --> 01:52:40,660
Took me two hours, but we actually did it.

2360
01:52:41,140 --> 01:52:43,940
We graduated elementary school.

2361
01:52:44,360 --> 01:52:45,800
We're in middle school already.

2362
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:51,500
I don't have to repeat the fifth grade.

2363
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:57,900
Mike, thank you for the superchat.

2364
01:52:58,120 --> 01:52:59,260
Thank you, thank you.

2365
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:02,940
Lord Kurosis, thank you for the superchat.

2366
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:03,360
Thank you.

2367
01:53:03,540 --> 01:53:10,020
Doki confirmed she isn't strong enough to survive the horrors of the American public school system.

2368
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:11,880
Thank you for the superchat.

2369
01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:12,500
Thank you.

2370
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:13,580
Thank you.

2371
01:53:14,440 --> 01:53:16,080
Oh my god.

2372
01:53:16,860 --> 01:53:20,300
We just have to get rid of United States.

2373
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:23,640
We just have to fucking dynostab them.

2374
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:27,700
That's the only way.

2375
01:53:28,180 --> 01:53:32,100
The amount of times I got fucked over because of America.

2376
01:53:36,160 --> 01:53:38,900
I just had to turn this off.

2377
01:53:50,920 --> 01:53:52,440
I'm sorry.

2378
01:53:52,580 --> 01:53:54,180
It was the only way.

2379
01:53:54,360 --> 01:53:59,200
It was literally the only way to get out of there.

2380
01:53:59,660 --> 01:54:04,760
I didn't want to repeat school again, guys.

2381
01:54:05,100 --> 01:54:06,080
I'm sorry.

2382
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:10,020
I just didn't want to repeat the grade.

2383
01:54:10,580 --> 01:54:11,800
So it's too old.

2384
01:54:12,240 --> 01:54:14,640
Anton, thank you for the superchat.

2385
01:54:14,780 --> 01:54:15,120
Thank you.

2386
01:54:15,240 --> 01:54:15,820
Thank you.

2387
01:54:19,320 --> 01:54:21,280
Doki, looking forward to seeing you in Atlanta.

2388
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:22,280
Have you been before?

2389
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:23,880
Will you do 3AM Waffle House?

2390
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:25,880
Do you know of... What the fuck is Okra?

2391
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:27,160
Thank you for the superchat.

2392
01:54:27,240 --> 01:54:28,520
Thank you.

2393
01:54:28,920 --> 01:54:35,160
No, I've never been to Atlanta, but I'll talk more about it in the superchat reading today.

2394
01:54:35,220 --> 01:54:37,180
I'm tired of this superchat reading today.

2395
01:54:39,420 --> 01:54:40,380
After successfully...

2396
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:42,920
Another superchat.

2397
01:54:43,060 --> 01:54:43,200
Thank you.

2398
01:54:43,420 --> 01:54:55,220
After successfully graduating elementary school, I can confidently say that yes, I am smarter than a fifth grader.

2399
01:54:55,420 --> 01:55:02,040
As we all learned from HuniePop, it's not about the journey.

2400
01:55:02,580 --> 01:55:05,240
It's that it's the endgame.

2401
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:08,580
I eventually made it through.

2402
01:55:09,120 --> 01:55:13,320
So in the end, I am smarter than a fifth grader.

2403
01:55:15,100 --> 01:55:18,020
We might have got rid of an entire country.

2404
01:55:18,300 --> 01:55:20,960
We might have got rid of several countries.

2405
01:55:21,480 --> 01:55:24,440
But in the end, we made it.

2406
01:55:27,220 --> 01:55:29,900
We learned what a kilogram is today.

2407
01:55:34,990 --> 01:55:36,190
And what...

2408
01:55:36,190 --> 01:55:39,510
We learned what a whole number is today as well.

2409
01:55:39,930 --> 01:55:42,030
We learned so many new things.

2410
01:55:42,450 --> 01:55:43,890
And I swear to God.

2411
01:55:44,210 --> 01:55:45,650
I swear to God.

2412
01:55:45,850 --> 01:55:50,790
I swear if I go up to a first grader and be like what the fuck is an aviation?

2413
01:55:51,070 --> 01:55:54,190
They won't know jack shit what aviation is.

2414
01:55:54,350 --> 01:55:59,070
Why would you teach a second grader to spell extraterrestrial?

2415
01:55:59,370 --> 01:56:00,130
What are they?

2416
01:56:00,330 --> 01:56:01,670
Some spelling bee champion?

2417
01:56:02,090 --> 01:56:04,130
They didn't even give me a sentence.

2418
01:56:04,630 --> 01:56:06,270
Are we doing the spelling bee?

2419
01:56:07,030 --> 01:56:14,810
In second grade, I did spelling classes in fifth grade and we didn't have a word for fucking extraterrestrial.

2420
01:56:19,690 --> 01:56:20,170
Like...

2421
01:56:21,310 --> 01:56:24,070
And I almost spelled equipment with two t's like that.

2422
01:56:24,430 --> 01:56:34,210
That was a little bit... But at that point my mind... At that point I was at that stage where... I was at that stage of mindset where like everything felt like not false.

2423
01:56:34,330 --> 01:56:36,750
Like everything in my life, I doubted.

2424
01:56:36,830 --> 01:56:39,670
Like I thought I was taught the wrong thing in my entire life.

2425
01:56:40,190 --> 01:56:40,670
Like...

2426
01:56:40,670 --> 01:56:40,990
I...

2427
01:56:42,990 --> 01:56:47,370
I was at the stage where I didn't know what's real and wasn't real anymore.

2428
01:56:47,830 --> 01:56:48,170
Like...

2429
01:56:48,690 --> 01:56:53,710
I just learned that salmon and tuna gives me mercury poisoning if I eat too much of it.

2430
01:56:53,890 --> 01:56:54,490
But like...

2431
01:56:54,490 --> 01:56:56,110
I eat a lot of salmon and tuna.

2432
01:56:56,450 --> 01:56:58,210
So like... I'm just like... I'm like...

2433
01:56:58,210 --> 01:57:00,610
Is my life like this because of salmon and tuna?

2434
01:57:00,950 --> 01:57:05,890
Like I feel like that should be like a more public concern than what it is.

2435
01:57:06,050 --> 01:57:06,410
Like...

2436
01:57:06,410 --> 01:57:07,890
Why did I have to learn now?

2437
01:57:08,110 --> 01:57:10,110
After X amount of years.

2438
01:57:10,230 --> 01:57:11,750
After since I was born.

2439
01:57:12,070 --> 01:57:14,230
Why did I have to learn that now?

2440
01:57:14,230 --> 01:57:20,770
Like 20 plus years is when I learned mercury poisoning occurs by eating fish.

2441
01:57:20,850 --> 01:57:22,350
Yet we don't give a shit.

2442
01:57:22,450 --> 01:57:23,470
We just keep eating.

2443
01:57:24,410 --> 01:57:24,990
Like...

2444
01:57:24,990 --> 01:57:31,810
I feel like that should be a more public knowledge thing than it was for me learning from a video game.

2445
01:57:32,950 --> 01:57:33,530
Like...

2446
01:57:38,650 --> 01:57:39,230
Okay.

2447
01:57:39,710 --> 01:57:42,310
Like now I have several new fears unlocked.

2448
01:57:42,590 --> 01:57:43,930
And the honey part too.

2449
01:57:44,410 --> 01:57:48,450
The honey part... The honey part was pretty fucked up.

2450
01:57:48,830 --> 01:57:49,770
Whoever... I don't even know.

2451
01:57:49,850 --> 01:57:50,350
Was it Ava?

2452
01:57:50,770 --> 01:57:53,610
Ava seemed to be like the one that kept giving me fucked up facts.

2453
01:57:53,750 --> 01:57:55,070
Like fucked up fun facts.

2454
01:57:55,190 --> 01:57:57,390
But like when Ava was like Fun fact!

2455
01:57:57,870 --> 01:57:58,650
You can die.

2456
01:57:58,770 --> 01:58:00,190
You can kill a baby with honey.

2457
01:58:00,290 --> 01:58:02,210
And I'm like Wait, what?

2458
01:58:03,630 --> 01:58:04,070
Like...

2459
01:58:04,690 --> 01:58:06,370
What do you mean you can...

2460
01:58:06,370 --> 01:58:08,110
A baby can die from that?

2461
01:58:08,470 --> 01:58:08,910
Like...

2462
01:58:10,310 --> 01:58:12,170
That wasn't fun at all.

2463
01:58:13,070 --> 01:58:13,510
Like...

2464
01:58:14,350 --> 01:58:15,850
That wasn't fun!

2465
01:58:18,350 --> 01:58:20,070
I didn't want to learn that!

2466
01:58:21,030 --> 01:58:21,470
Like...

2467
01:58:22,890 --> 01:58:23,330
Anyway...

2468
01:58:23,330 --> 01:58:26,710
We haven't been able to do super chat reading in a long time.

2469
01:58:26,790 --> 01:58:27,770
So today...

2470
01:58:27,770 --> 01:58:29,030
Today's our lucky day.

2471
01:58:30,910 --> 01:58:34,210
I won't be able to do all the super chats, but I'll try my best.

2472
01:58:34,570 --> 01:58:36,350
Also wanted to hang out with you guys for a little longer.

2473
01:58:36,910 --> 01:58:37,210
Alright.

2474
01:58:37,910 --> 01:58:39,510
By the way, did I successfully...

2475
01:58:40,130 --> 01:58:43,910
Did my honey pot vod successfully blurred?

2476
01:58:44,090 --> 01:58:45,490
Did I fully saved it?

2477
01:58:45,750 --> 01:58:47,790
It's still monetized too, by the way.

2478
01:58:47,870 --> 01:58:50,710
Like, the monetization is on.

2479
01:58:53,710 --> 01:58:59,510
Guys, okay, the craziest part about the honey pot stream is that...

2480
01:59:00,430 --> 01:59:00,950
Like...

2481
01:59:00,950 --> 01:59:03,390
It has 481 comments.

2482
01:59:04,290 --> 01:59:07,450
And then the stream before it was like 39 comments.

2483
01:59:11,550 --> 01:59:12,810
I... I...

2484
01:59:12,810 --> 01:59:15,530
It was a wild day yesterday.

2485
01:59:16,110 --> 01:59:16,770
It was...

2486
01:59:17,550 --> 01:59:21,870
It was a fucking wild day yesterday.

2487
01:59:23,110 --> 01:59:23,990
Um...

2488
01:59:23,990 --> 01:59:24,450
Alright.

2489
01:59:24,890 --> 01:59:27,370
Wait, because it was the last stream was the collab!

2490
01:59:27,930 --> 01:59:28,810
With...

2491
01:59:29,150 --> 01:59:30,910
With the Sloth Sisters.

2492
01:59:32,050 --> 01:59:33,310
I survived.

2493
01:59:35,210 --> 01:59:39,950
People had a lot of things to say about that stream.

2494
01:59:41,830 --> 01:59:46,030
Wait, I haven't went to the Super Chat category in a long time.

2495
01:59:46,090 --> 01:59:47,730
We haven't done Super Chat reading in so long.

2496
01:59:47,850 --> 01:59:48,830
I'm so sorry, everybody.

2497
01:59:49,270 --> 01:59:50,650
We've been so busy.

2498
01:59:54,770 --> 01:59:55,170
Um...

2499
01:59:55,170 --> 01:59:57,030
Seija, Nicholas, thank you for the Super Chat.

2500
01:59:57,110 --> 01:59:58,210
Thank you, thank you.

2501
01:59:58,330 --> 02:00:01,230
I'm trying to remember which one I've read and which one I haven't.

2502
02:00:03,270 --> 02:00:03,670
Um...

2503
02:00:03,670 --> 02:00:06,390
Um... Because I, like, read Super Chats in between.

2504
02:00:07,610 --> 02:00:08,830
Wings, thank you for the Super Chat.

2505
02:00:08,930 --> 02:00:09,610
Thank you, thank you.

2506
02:00:09,610 --> 02:00:11,950
Just calling out chat like that.

2507
02:00:12,930 --> 02:00:14,230
Thank you for the Super Chat.

2508
02:00:14,590 --> 02:00:15,710
Wings, thank you.

2509
02:00:15,850 --> 02:00:17,470
I mean, look!

2510
02:00:18,410 --> 02:00:24,430
My comments usually don't exceed 100 comments unless it's a very, like, a special event or anything.

2511
02:00:24,850 --> 02:00:37,370
But for some reason, not only did Honeypot Not only did Honeypot exceed 100 comments, we have 481 comments.

2512
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:43,560
Oh, man.

2513
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:44,940
But thank you for the Super Chat.

2514
02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:45,900
Thank you, thank you.

2515
02:00:46,240 --> 02:00:49,700
Medieval Doki Bird be like, why you fucking number?

2516
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:51,820
Thank you for the Super Chat.

2517
02:00:51,940 --> 02:00:52,760
Thank you, thank you.

2518
02:00:52,780 --> 02:00:57,840
Okay, I even cheated and, like, Hayley fucked it up.

2519
02:00:58,260 --> 02:01:00,000
I was like, I can't answer this.

2520
02:01:00,080 --> 02:01:01,880
I don't know what a whole number is.

2521
02:01:01,900 --> 02:01:06,920
Like, I'm getting paranoid on what a whole number was.

2522
02:01:07,120 --> 02:01:08,340
And I even asked Hayley.

2523
02:01:08,480 --> 02:01:10,480
I was like, Hayley, you should know.

2524
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:13,700
You're literally in fifth grade right now.

2525
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:16,500
You should know what a whole number is.

2526
02:01:17,120 --> 02:01:19,100
And then Hayley was like, three.

2527
02:01:19,700 --> 02:01:22,720
Like, you cannot blame me for that.

2528
02:01:23,100 --> 02:01:25,560
Like, Hayley was the one that fucked it up.

2529
02:01:25,660 --> 02:01:26,980
I thought it was, too.

2530
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:29,120
But I was like, you know what?

2531
02:01:29,420 --> 02:01:31,980
I wanna make sure that I'm right.

2532
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:33,720
So let me go ask Hayley.

2533
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:35,760
Cause, like, she's literally in fifth grade.

2534
02:01:36,160 --> 02:01:36,620
I...

2535
02:01:38,180 --> 02:01:38,660
I...

2536
02:01:38,660 --> 02:01:40,360
I was like, it has to be two.

2537
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:42,660
But like, I was like, but what if I'm wrong?

2538
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:43,540
Alright, Hayley.

2539
02:01:43,940 --> 02:01:46,080
I'm gonna make sure you double check my answer.

2540
02:01:46,380 --> 02:01:48,760
And then she was like, three.

2541
02:01:50,820 --> 02:01:52,560
What do you want me to do?

2542
02:01:54,440 --> 02:01:56,740
It wasn't even me at that point.

2543
02:01:56,920 --> 02:01:59,420
Like, what do I do at that point?

2544
02:01:59,420 --> 02:02:00,320
Hayley.

2545
02:02:03,130 --> 02:02:06,560
In my defense, I tried to cheat off a child.

2546
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:08,880
And the child fucked me over.

2547
02:02:09,320 --> 02:02:13,420
The child was closer to first grade than I was.

2548
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:17,880
Like, like, the child was closer.

2549
02:02:18,160 --> 02:02:21,200
Her age gap to first grade was closer.

2550
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:24,980
So why does she not know what a whole number was?

2551
02:02:25,360 --> 02:02:27,120
Like, not so dead.

2552
02:02:27,120 --> 02:02:28,660
Thank you for the super chat.

2553
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:29,060
Thank you.

2554
02:02:29,100 --> 02:02:33,560
According to DaddyYT, FNAF is raunchier than Honey Boy.

2555
02:02:33,720 --> 02:02:34,780
That's so true.

2556
02:02:35,420 --> 02:02:35,500
Wait.

2557
02:02:36,440 --> 02:02:38,380
My FNAF stream got...

2558
02:02:38,820 --> 02:02:42,380
My FNAF stream got R18 gated.

2559
02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:48,240
But yet, Honey Pot is still appropriate for all ages.

2560
02:02:48,680 --> 02:02:49,940
Like, I...

2561
02:02:51,540 --> 02:02:53,220
Like, okay.

2562
02:02:54,020 --> 02:02:57,220
We're in a little little oopsie here.

2563
02:02:58,040 --> 02:03:05,720
It was all horror, horror, horror, horror, horror, horror, and then it'll be funny if this guy's fucking gay.

2564
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:08,600
I can't catch it.

2565
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:13,240
Honey Pot more family-friendly than FNAF.

2566
02:03:13,420 --> 02:03:17,540
FNAF is literally my only um...

2567
02:03:17,540 --> 02:03:26,380
FNAF was like my only R18 stream I've ever had an 18 in...

2568
02:03:26,380 --> 02:03:27,560
18 years of streaming.

2569
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:36,360
I mean, like, in the last 4 years of streaming as a VTuber, FNAF was literally the only stream I ever got R18.

2570
02:03:38,440 --> 02:03:42,200
Which is incredibly crazy to think about.

2571
02:03:43,860 --> 02:03:45,760
Thank you for the super chat.

2572
02:03:45,860 --> 02:03:46,920
Thank you, thank you.

2573
02:03:48,520 --> 02:03:49,060
Um...

2574
02:03:49,060 --> 02:03:50,920
OGPon, thank you for the super chat.

2575
02:03:50,980 --> 02:03:51,740
Thank you, thank you.

2576
02:03:51,820 --> 02:03:56,720
As someone who has 100% both Honey Pot games, I sadly missed stream last night, but I hope you enjoyed the game.

2577
02:03:57,920 --> 02:03:58,360
Yeah...

2578
02:03:58,360 --> 02:04:00,240
Yeah, that...

2579
02:04:00,240 --> 02:04:02,340
I learned a lot yesterday.

2580
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:03,920
I learned a lot today as well.

2581
02:04:04,440 --> 02:04:05,820
Thank you for the super chat.

2582
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:06,820
Thank you, thank you.

2583
02:04:07,220 --> 02:04:08,820
Anton by Oshii.

2584
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:10,460
I'm not a fail, girl!

2585
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:14,120
I made it to the end of the journey.

2586
02:04:14,520 --> 02:04:16,080
The journey doesn't matter.

2587
02:04:16,340 --> 02:04:17,220
It's the end game.

2588
02:04:17,420 --> 02:04:19,120
And I made it to end game.

2589
02:04:19,120 --> 02:04:26,760
I saw people in chat being like, oh, Doki's not even gonna make it to the last date.

2590
02:04:26,920 --> 02:04:28,300
And I did.

2591
02:04:28,680 --> 02:04:36,160
I didn't even need you guys to ratatouille me on my head to try and like... I didn't even need you guys to ratatouille me, chat.

2592
02:04:36,340 --> 02:04:38,080
And I was able to succeed.

2593
02:04:38,220 --> 02:04:42,020
I freestyled 50% of those dates, guys.

2594
02:04:42,220 --> 02:04:43,880
I freestyled it.

2595
02:04:45,080 --> 02:04:49,820
After you guys yelled at me, I was like, I'm gonna freestyle now.

2596
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:54,060
Thank you for the super chat.

2597
02:04:54,160 --> 02:04:55,280
Thank you, thank you.

2598
02:04:56,280 --> 02:04:59,260
My Oshii is a whole nother fail, girl.

2599
02:04:59,660 --> 02:05:00,760
Thank you for the super chat, Anton.

2600
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:02,480
Thank you, thank you, Alan.

2601
02:05:02,900 --> 02:05:03,740
What's a kilogram?

2602
02:05:04,780 --> 02:05:07,320
When will kilogram ever be useful?

2603
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:10,340
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

2604
02:05:10,520 --> 02:05:11,700
Thank you, thank you.

2605
02:05:11,980 --> 02:05:14,000
Like, I use pounds!

2606
02:05:14,240 --> 02:05:15,420
I don't use kilograms!

2607
02:05:15,960 --> 02:05:17,620
I use pounds!

2608
02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:22,580
So often when?

2609
02:05:22,740 --> 02:05:23,320
In cooking?

2610
02:05:23,480 --> 02:05:25,780
I don't use kilograms in cooking!

2611
02:05:27,020 --> 02:05:33,500
Toki, you're not the American spirit.

2612
02:05:34,940 --> 02:05:37,060
Aren't you Canadian?

2613
02:05:37,620 --> 02:05:38,740
We have... No!

2614
02:05:38,940 --> 02:05:39,340
Okay!

2615
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:40,540
No, guys, no.

2616
02:05:40,600 --> 02:05:41,960
Canada's actually really fucked up.

2617
02:05:42,260 --> 02:05:46,460
In Canada, we use pounds for just that.

2618
02:05:46,680 --> 02:05:51,160
Like, we use pounds, and then, and then, like, I don't know.

2619
02:05:51,240 --> 02:05:52,980
I don't know what's wrong with us, but...

2620
02:05:52,980 --> 02:05:55,580
I don't, I don't know.

2621
02:05:55,820 --> 02:05:59,320
No, in Canada, we actually use pounds!

2622
02:06:01,280 --> 02:06:04,460
so, so, it's a weird mixture.

2623
02:06:05,120 --> 02:06:07,340
It's like, it's a mixture of it.

2624
02:06:07,460 --> 02:06:15,600
Cause I remember talking to somebody in EU, I think I was, like, talking to, like, um, I was talking to, like, oh, I don't remember who.

2625
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:17,920
It was, like, some fucking Apex player.

2626
02:06:18,300 --> 02:06:21,120
Uh, sorry, it's all blurring together.

2627
02:06:21,420 --> 02:06:25,260
And then, they were like, oh, yeah, it's, like, something kilogram.

2628
02:06:25,840 --> 02:06:27,980
And then, I was like, what the fuck is a kilogram?

2629
02:06:28,320 --> 02:06:30,460
I was like, I don't know what the fuck that is!

2630
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:35,100
And then, and then he was like, oh, wait, aren't you Canadian?

2631
02:06:35,560 --> 02:06:39,800
And then, I was like, yeah, but, yeah, but we use pounds.

2632
02:06:39,900 --> 02:06:41,700
And then, he was like, what the fuck?

2633
02:06:43,400 --> 02:06:45,780
It's like, I was like, what the fuck?

2634
02:06:49,020 --> 02:06:51,860
So, we just, we use a mix!

2635
02:06:51,980 --> 02:06:53,120
We use pounds!

2636
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:54,840
Like, I don't know what to say!

2637
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,740
Like, that's what we, it's cause America's our neighbor!

2638
02:06:58,300 --> 02:07:03,380
And it, like, America's our neighbor, and it, like, mixed in.

2639
02:07:03,500 --> 02:07:08,640
Like, they, they infected us, like, with some of their stupid shit!

2640
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:13,200
Like, with some of their, like, stupid measurements and shit!

2641
02:07:13,380 --> 02:07:20,720
Like, did you guys see that SNL, the only good recent SNL skit where they made fun of the American measurement system?

2642
02:07:20,960 --> 02:07:27,080
That, that's, like, legitimately like, um, one of the few good SNL skits they've done.

2643
02:07:28,180 --> 02:07:28,820
What was it?

2644
02:07:28,860 --> 02:07:30,480
Oh, yeah, Washington's Dream.

2645
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:32,840
That was legit, that was pretty funny.

2646
02:07:33,260 --> 02:07:33,840
Um, what was it?

2647
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:35,560
SNL measurement skit.

2648
02:07:35,640 --> 02:07:36,480
I'm gonna do Twitter.

2649
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:40,140
Um, oh my God, you can do it at rfunny.

2650
02:07:40,240 --> 02:07:41,600
Let's fucking go.

2651
02:07:45,830 --> 02:07:54,130
SNL is cringe now, but, like, they actually had a, um, they had an actual good SNL skit, which is very surprising.

2652
02:07:54,490 --> 02:08:02,710
And it, it was talking about the same thing, which I'm SNL skit, George Walsh.

2653
02:08:02,770 --> 02:08:04,610
It's actually, actually pretty good.

2654
02:08:05,430 --> 02:08:06,550
Um, what's SNL?

2655
02:08:06,770 --> 02:08:07,650
Saturday Night Live.

2656
02:08:07,770 --> 02:08:12,050
It was legitimately, like, the only good skit they've ever done in, like, years.

2657
02:08:12,290 --> 02:08:18,130
Like, the only good thing they've done in so long.

2658
02:08:18,190 --> 02:08:20,350
I don't even know who's in the fucking cast anymore.

2659
02:08:20,950 --> 02:08:23,170
Um, other than, like, what's his name?

2660
02:08:23,310 --> 02:08:25,310
That one guy that will never leave.

2661
02:08:26,710 --> 02:08:28,570
Like, you know what I'm talking about?

2662
02:08:28,710 --> 02:08:33,870
That one guy who's gonna be in SNL for the rest of his fucking life.

2663
02:08:35,670 --> 02:08:36,810
Alright, here you go.

2664
02:08:38,110 --> 02:08:39,010
I think this is it.

2665
02:08:39,150 --> 02:08:40,150
Let me double-check.

2666
02:08:40,270 --> 02:08:42,170
I need to make sure my, my Chrome isn't.

2667
02:08:46,500 --> 02:08:47,140
There you go.

2668
02:08:47,480 --> 02:08:48,260
Kenan, yes!

2669
02:08:48,820 --> 02:08:52,840
The only SNL guy I know that's still there is Kenan Thompson.

2670
02:08:53,040 --> 02:08:54,460
He's never gonna fucking leave.

2671
02:08:54,520 --> 02:08:56,180
He's gonna die at SNL.

2672
02:08:56,560 --> 02:08:56,720
Like,

2673
02:09:03,080 --> 02:09:03,520
umm...

2674
02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:05,000
Um...

2675
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:05,660
Let's see.

2676
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:09,980
Uh, Wristwatch, thank you for the superchat.

2677
02:09:10,140 --> 02:09:10,420
Thank you.

2678
02:09:12,700 --> 02:09:13,140
RockTimer.

2679
02:09:14,440 --> 02:09:15,260
Superchat, thank you.

2680
02:09:16,260 --> 02:09:16,700
Zayn.

2681
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:17,480
Thank you for the superchat.

2682
02:09:17,580 --> 02:09:17,820
Thank you.

2683
02:09:18,380 --> 02:09:19,700
We don't ratatouille you.

2684
02:09:20,120 --> 02:09:21,980
The potato... the tomato pilot.

2685
02:09:22,260 --> 02:09:22,720
The skin...

2686
02:09:23,540 --> 02:09:31,440
It's like a bunch of small tomatoes In my head right now within the tomato trying to figure out what the fuck to do.

2687
02:09:31,700 --> 02:09:32,440
Thank you for the super chat.

2688
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:32,800
Thank you.

2689
02:09:32,860 --> 02:09:33,480
Thank you.

2690
02:09:33,820 --> 02:09:34,640
Not so deadpool.

2691
02:09:35,020 --> 02:09:38,480
You cried trying to use pounds in yesterday's stream.

2692
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:39,580
Not so deadpool.

2693
02:09:39,580 --> 02:09:42,860
Look, I didn't say I was good at measurements.

2694
02:09:43,120 --> 02:09:47,660
I just say that we use pounds like I fucking I don't remember majority of things I learned.

2695
02:09:48,060 --> 02:09:49,240
Like not so deadpool.

2696
02:09:49,340 --> 02:09:50,260
Thank you for the super chat.

2697
02:09:50,340 --> 02:09:50,600
Thank you.

2698
02:09:50,660 --> 02:09:51,160
Thank you.

2699
02:09:51,440 --> 02:09:52,280
Lord Kurosis.

2700
02:09:52,520 --> 02:09:53,260
Thank you for the super chat.

2701
02:09:53,340 --> 02:09:53,600
Thank you.

2702
02:09:53,640 --> 02:09:54,080
Thank you.

2703
02:09:54,080 --> 02:09:56,380
Doki hates kilograms and failed us.

2704
02:09:56,440 --> 02:09:58,000
I did not fail!

2705
02:09:58,580 --> 02:10:01,760
Repeating a grade does not mean I failed.

2706
02:10:02,040 --> 02:10:05,240
Like I still got past elementary school.

2707
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:10,040
It might have taken me eight years too late, but like I still got past it.

2708
02:10:10,780 --> 02:10:14,220
We welcome her as an honorary American.

2709
02:10:14,720 --> 02:10:15,600
Thank you for the super chat.

2710
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:16,100
Thank you.

2711
02:10:16,140 --> 02:10:16,800
Thank you.

2712
02:10:17,240 --> 02:10:19,160
