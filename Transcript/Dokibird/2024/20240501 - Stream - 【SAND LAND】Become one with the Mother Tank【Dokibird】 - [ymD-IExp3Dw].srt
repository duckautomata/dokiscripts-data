1
00:01:48,730 --> 00:02:00,990
good morning everybody I am I'm still waking up oh my gosh I
need 12 30 streams I can't believe I used to stream at 12 p

2
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,210
.m.

3
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:11,430
like what the fuck was wrong with me I could barely be awake
at 12 30 I remember when I used to stream at 12 p.m.

4
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,030
and then I was like I can't guys my body is not

5
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:35,310
and that's like 12 30 I was like why oh my god who I thought
30 minutes does no difference at all my body is still so

6
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:50,850
weak good morning everybody I'm so excited to play part two
of settling I want to do like before we start i want to do a

7
00:02:50,850 --> 00:03:04,610
huge shout out to uh bandai for um also giving us i believe
six codes for sandland two for pc two for playstation and

8
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:20,110
two for xbox so um if you somehow got the playstation code
and you don't have a playstation well uh that well Actually,

9
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,310
you couldn't because you have to activate that code on your
PlayStation.

10
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:36,170
So at the end of the stream, I would highly, I would be
giving out these codes at the end of the stream.

11
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,570
So what I'll be doing is that I'll just be pasting the
codes.

12
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,290
I'll just give a countdown for all you guys.

13
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,350
And I'd be like pasting the codes in chat at the end of the
stream.

14
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:57,090
codes and Xbox codes so I assume that like it works on
either I assume okay so like all you have to do because like

15
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:05,050
PlayStation 5 has like uh what's the word called it has like
uh backwards compatibility for PlayStation 4 so like all you

16
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:13,670
have to do is just um at the end of the stream just have
your PlayStation PlayStation or Xbox out in advance so like

17
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:21,210
you can like fight for the code it's basically whoever puts
the code down the fastest would basically activate it.

18
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:30,770
So all you have to do is just have your fucking PlayStation
Xbox ready to activate the code on your console.

19
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:36,870
So, and it's just whoever activates it first gets the game.

20
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,030
Miracle, thank you for the super chat.

21
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,130
Thank you, thank you.

22
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:48,710
But yes, so it'll be two PC codes, two PlayStation codes,
and two Xbox.

23
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:56,230
goods again like a huge shout out for bandai for uh giving
us these codes as well as the collectors sending me a

24
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:02,530
collector's edition of the game i really honestly did not
expect it i don't know if you guys know this but like bandai

25
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:13,510
was like one one of the games i couldn't really play back
then uh because you know perms so i was like super surprised

26
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:20,530
not gonna lie i was so surprise with how supportive they've
been uh with sandland and how supportive they've been of me

27
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:28,790
like playing like a lot of their other games because i've
always wanted to play like digimon games um before then but

28
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:37,470
i couldn't so like it's really really i'm really thankful
for bandai uh to like you know supporting me be like

29
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:44,230
encouraging me to play more bandai games as well so yeah
thank you again i really appreciate it because like that

30
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:53,250
means i can finally play like digimon world like i i've
always wanted to play i've always wanted to play digimon

31
00:05:53,250 --> 00:06:03,790
world and i'm so happy i'll actually be able to like try it
out in the future uh who's jerky's digimon favorite my

32
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:17,590
favorite has to be either uh terrier mon uh terrier mon
gabumon and also uh renamon uh honestly like gen 3 of

33
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:27,630
digimon what is it called gen i don't remember if it's
series 3 series 3 of digimon is like the most optimal

34
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:35,430
digimon designs in my opinion um the only like digimon
designs i oh gotomon too i really love gotomon as well

35
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,690
gotomon uh terrier

36
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:51,650
and I think that's really it but like I'm gonna say Gabumon
fell down in my love for his design because I talked about

37
00:06:51,650 --> 00:07:02,070
this before but I realized he's wearing a skinned animal I
just I realized like if you guys didn't notice he's not

38
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:09,910
actually like the fucking thing he has on top of him is like
his fur it's not even his fur and then you take it off it

39
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:16,890
looks so ugly like people were like what does it look like
underneath and then i like looked up like like they're like

40
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:28,250
fan designs of what's underneath gabumon and um and every
time i look at it i it just ruined gabumon for me i just i

41
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:36,490
just can't i can't take like gabumon seriously knowing like
what it could look like underneath and it's just i'm sorry

42
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,610
he's so ugly

43
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,250
He's just, I'm sorry.

44
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:49,390
Like, the, the, the, without the pelt, he's so ugly.

45
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:54,350
And I can't, like, change my love for Gabumon.

46
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,490
Because all I can think about is what's underneath the pelt.

47
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,370
Well, okay, do you guys not know?

48
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:00,990
Okay, here.

49
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,970
This is, like, what people think Gabumon looks.

50
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,490
Because he's has a double chin.

51
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,430
I don't know if you guys notice.

52
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:17,410
But, like, the pelt hides the fact that he has, like, double
chin so it looks so weird it looks so weird without the pe

53
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:23,570
because then it's like it's like accentuates the double chin
and i'm like oh poor kabuman

54
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:35,590
like look at this like what the fuck is this like look
there's a double chin what do you mean Look, it's right

55
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,250
here.

56
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,850
Do you not see it?

57
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,310
It's right here.

58
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:54,950
I'm not crazy It's literally right here That's why he's so
cute All right, yeah, it's like a guy that shaves off his

59
00:08:54,950 --> 00:09:00,970
beard So that's just a lie

60
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,670
That's a fan design.

61
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:07,990
It doesn't count.

62
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,950
It won't hide the fact.

63
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,530
It won't hide his chin.

64
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,890
Like his chin was the only thing that's exposed.

65
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,070
Anyway.

66
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:17,530
Um.

67
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:19,770
Anyway.

68
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:20,930
Um.

69
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:21,930
No matter what.

70
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,290
We all know what's underneath.

71
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,990
It's not as cute as what's like what he has.

72
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:26,410
Like.

73
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,190
Um.

74
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,090
But yeah.

75
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:32,590
Anyway.

76
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,230
I used to really like Gobble.

77
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:45,630
man and uh joki is a ditchy chamber anyway as i was saying i
used to really like gabo man but then like my whole love for

78
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:57,010
gabo man basically like um died i still he's still in my top
five designs it's just that you know i realized he wasn't as

79
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:06,810
cute as i thought he was because the all the the cute factor
comes from the the thing he's wearing so so I was just like

80
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:16,130
oh yeah I was just in love with the fur design I was in love
with him and he died it's not even his fur that's the thing

81
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:26,510
it's not even his fur so like I'm not even in love with like
him it's like I was in love with what he was wearing so it's

82
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:37,610
not really him he basically like skinned at somebody else's
fur and put it on top of him so whichever fur that came from

83
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:50,010
that's the design i'm in love with you only liked him for
his fur damn right i'm not fucking ashamed of that i read it

84
00:10:50,010 --> 00:11:00,110
um jl thank you for the super chat my kamioshi exposing
gabumon like thank you for the super chat thank you thank

85
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:11,610

reaching out and uh like and um uh and supporting this

86
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:18,110
playthrough i don't know if you guys saw but like uh you
guys all know like this is actually like the very last name

87
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:26,270
that toriama was involved in um so like as i say this trip
team playing this game sort of like a uh like uh loki like

88
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:34,050
tribute to him and everything but this was like the last
game he was actually like publicly involved in and they even

89
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:41,910
like put up he even had like a statement written for this
game um before he passed away um i was like reading the

90
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:48,490
statement and he was like really proud of this game and like
really proud of like the world that was developed for this

91
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:55,430
game because there's like stuff that's not in the manga that
like they added in and things that he wanted to be added to

92
00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:06,170
the manga that um that like they ended up adding in the game

you guys okay all i'm saying is that you voted for japanese
so i will not be reading out the english dialogue like you

98
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:56,050
It's like subs versus dubs now.

00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:56,650
All right.

100
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:00,590
Why?

Because you guys voted for the Japanese dub.

102
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,190
What do you mean?

103
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,050
Why not?

104
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,530
You guys had a choice.

105
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:14,690

169
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:29,770
What did I want?

170
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:30,150

229
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,630
I wish things were that easy.

230
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,010

What do you mean by that?

233
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,450

234
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,770

235
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,030

236
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,030
How can it fail?

237
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:28,370
It has a population of like five people.

238
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,110
I don't understand.

239
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,750
No!

240
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:52,250
We'll just, we'll just deconstruct a garage and reconstruct
it later.

241
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:01,310
There's only like two kids in this town.

242
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:06,510
All right, for an old friend's son and wife to look after
them.

243
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,070
Who's Hugh and Plika?

244
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,190
Is that the kids?

245
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,030
I'm sorry, I forgot the names.

246
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:41,530
Oh So it's like so see just tell them tell them like his
grandpa hates him then they'll understand it's a lot But it

247
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:42,650
will be a good lie

248
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:53,130
Yeah, you want the kids to die in this town?

249
00:21:53,350 --> 00:22:08,150
That's so fucked up lady Oh shit I like how these guys are
just listening into this very private conversation i i i

250
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:14,470
like uh they're just listening it is standing there and
being listening to this family drama like some fucking

251
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,010
television show

252
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:32,010
oh so they don't have food or water that's why this town is
dying to be fair there's like no young people in this town

253
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,530
it's Except for that one lady.

254
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:38,290
Good listeners.

255
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:52,110
Does it help?

256
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:53,390
It doesn't even help.

257
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,330
Nobody moves in.

258
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:07,270
But they're like, like oh we want to attract more people to
spin you but it doesn't help there's no new people coming in

259
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:26,750
that's the whole problem they're not doing anything there's
no new people even if they're like oh this town is amazing

260
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:37,190
we don't have food or water like no matter how you gas up
this town work because there's no food or water let's tough

Oh my god, we're gonna do our job.

264
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,550
All right, nice.

265
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:30,290
We're gonna...

00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,830
The Demon King shall help.

267
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,830
Because that's what we know about the demons.

268
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,470
They love helping people.

269
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,770
Oh, the jump butt!

00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,010
So how's the sound sound guys?

271
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,490

00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,420
Now I remember why we never saved.

336
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,860
It didn't crash, but at what cost?

337
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,280
What's the car?

338
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,080
That's not the jump bot.

339
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,180
Yeah, let's say.

340
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,140
Oh,

341
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,680
here's the badness we beat up.

342
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,120
Because they're dying in the sad land.

343
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,840
People would fucking kill at that point.

344
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,780
It's literally anime maniacs.

345
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,260
Of course.

346
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:16,940

347
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,180

They look so...

354
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,480
They look like...

355
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,300
They really look 2D and 3D at the same time.

356
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:30,460
Wait, were you going to, like, invade their base again?

357
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:57,580

that like for an anime adaptation of a like for like a game

358
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:02,460
adapted from a anime slash manga that's not a fucking
fighting game

have bro that's basically like 90% of Dragon Ball Z games

361
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:46,400
but at least it makes sense because it's Dragon Ball Z
there's some fucking anime fighting games that don't fucking

438
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,830

446
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:39,050
Why the scout?

447
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:42,890
I want to see what the army might be able to throw at us.

448
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,670
Oh, we're going to test it out.

449
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,050
Okay.

00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:47,970

00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:03,850
Oh, my town!

459
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:04,990
Sorry, I lost my chin.

460
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:07,110
This is exactly why we have to put it back on English.

461
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:10,230
I actually lost my train of thought in the middle of
thinking about it.

462
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:12,430
So that girl, Anne.

463
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:14,770

Been thinking.

00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:22,350
She's a good girl.

469
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:23,910
Oh.

470
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,330

00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:30,990
That smile.

473
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,910
I'm afraid I don't follow either.

474
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:34,290
She's a good girl.

car lover in a good mood oh car lover next time come over to
say hello

477
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:08,510
You need a supervisor there if he's there alone with you
too.

478
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,210
You cannot be alone with this man.

479
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:13,550
Do you not see how he fucking smiled at you?

480
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,630
Cars are awesome.

481
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:17,830
I sure wish I had my own.

482
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:22,430
Oh, so you're a stranger danger.

483
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:28,110
Oh my god, it the fuck is wrong.

Then you should really head to the junk pit.

485
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,650
He needs a chaperone.

486

lease of junkers market there's a pit where junkers toss all

Might find a friend.

489
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:00,390
Do not go to that mad junk space.

490
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:05,490
Okay, car park.

491
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:07,310
Oh, these are all like side quests.

492
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:09,690
I can't wait to not...

493
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:09,950

494
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:13,750

Hey, nice to see you again.

496
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:18,310
Najinbu!

497
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:20,750
Is it just my imagination?

498
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:22,670
Or has the town gotten more lively?

499
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:24,370
Oh, yeah.

500
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:29,190

501
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:34,090
Okay, uh, do I have anything?

502
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:37,110
I need, like, two ancient coins?

503
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:39,590
Bring me any rare items you find.

504
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,270
I'll make it worth your while.

505
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:43,030
What are you gonna do with the ancient coin?

506
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:44,810
You want me to fucking...

507
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:48,110
You want me to fucking, like, ruin more ancient ruins?

508
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:51,270
That's why it's called ruin.

509
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:55,330
Sorry, I'm gonna discover...

510
00:43:55,450 --> 00:44:06,550
i'm here to discover more national treasures i uh i'd heard
demons were attacking passers-by stealing water and such

511
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:13,550
water but there's so much water behind you wait i thought
you guys were attacked like no food and water what is that

512
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:24,090
behind you i i i just got scared well there's some truth to
that but it sounds like back to the museum you're right

513
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:34,570
attacking passers-by we only take what we need from the
royal army exactly from the army you go up against yeah

514
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:41,850
because apparently the army is more evil than fucking satan
himself you must be really strong then sure am and i'm only

515
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:52,770
nine no wonder you can travel the dangerous sandland
unscathed that's bleach what the fuck i guess you're too

516
00:44:52,770 --> 00:45:04,890
strong to find it dangerous but to us humans stepping
outside town isn't something you do lightly just traveling

517
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:16,570
those weak flesh bodies but with the risk of bandit and
raptor attacks as well we're risking our lives every time we

518
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:27,190
go to another town that bad it is I can't travel alone
either yeah I can tell why Even seasoned peddlers have to be

519
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:34,710
careful You basically let a little boy do all the fighting
for you I can see why you can't travel alone You're a goner

520
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:43,130
So you need luck just to reach your destination Wait is this
an escort mission I guess that means I was lucky to meet you

521
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:56,450
guys Talking about all this has got me feeling a bit uneasy
She looks like chichi But with brown hair Well wears from a

522
00:45:56,450 --> 00:46:03,870
merchant oh my god have you guys seen like pakora has been
like doing like the dragon ball z streams and stuff and like

523
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:11,610
i she's never fucking watched or played any dragon ball z
like dragon ball games and it's actually or read any dragon

524
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:21,570
ball before so she like basically went in with zero
knowledge of dragon ball and i was like how like i can see

525
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,010
if you're like

526
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:38,870
That's just insane That is just I was like that's actually
crazy like growing up in Japan and never reading watching or

527
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:41,130
playing any dragon ball game.

528
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:53,090
That's I just like That blew my fucking mind when I when I
heard He's always had incredible luck so I didn't think much

529
00:46:53,090 --> 00:47:03,070
of it but what if he's in trouble so it's actually like she
actually goes in with zero knowledge and like like reacting

530
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:09,190
to it live for like first time seeing all these things so
like a lot of drag obviously like you know dragon ball is

531
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:16,450
like a huge like cultural phenomenon like overseas and also
domestically and the so like people like are watching it

532
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:24,130
because it's like you get to see an actual first time live
reaction of somebody like never who's never had any

533
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:30,250
background information about dragon ball like experiencing
it for the first time so they're basically like reliving

534
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:36,750
their life like they're watching it so they could like um
what's their word called it's like outer wilds like

535
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:47,070
basically reliving the experience through her type deal um
beelzebub if you ever see that merchant in trouble during

536
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:58,450
your travels could you please help him out maybe if i'm in
the mood thank you i'm counting on you and they're living

537
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:06,910
vicariously through her to re-experience dragon ball z for
like as if it's like the first time again which is very rare

538
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:13,790
it's actually i like i actually blew my fucking mind that
she never had any like dragon ball knowledge before playing

539
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:21,130
the game because she doesn't know anything that's going on
and she's like what like what the fuck

540
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:28,560
all right it's time to go

Oh my god, we're going 49 kilometers per hour.

619
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:35,960
Make sure to check your gear every now and then.

620
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,540
What's that supposed to mean?

621
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,320
Never know when something you've picked up might come in
handy.

622
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,540
What the fuck does that mean?

623
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,320

624
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:46,880
Okay, I'm gonna...

625
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:47,800
What does this look like?

626
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:48,140
Broom.

627
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:49,460
Broom.

628
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,840
Okay, that's what that does.

629
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,680

633
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,120
There's only one left.

634
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:34,840
I like how the NPCs are just following behind me.

635
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:37,840
All right, nice.

636
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:38,620
It's okay.

637
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,760
There's still one more left.

638
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:41,840
It's not...

639
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:42,820
What the fuck?

640
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,500
The Teredactals hate me as well?

641
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:46,820
But why?

642
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,000
I'm a good person.

643
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,360
What did I do?

644
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,520
I basically...

645
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:53,820
Oh, I...

646
00:54:53,840 --> 00:55:01,360

little bit you know because we don't kill guys remember guys

648
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:15,980

this universe because killing it is a lie we will never

649
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:22,340

650
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:23,730
Alright, we did it.

651
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:25,660

00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:29,960
Oh shit.

655
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:32,800
We gotta shoot some birds down.

656
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,720
There can only be one bird in the sky.

657
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,520
Don't get a child.

658
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:38,180
We're here.

659
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:38,900
Back at...

660
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,760
Wait, he gets his own car.

661
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,920
Okay, I like how he like follows me with his car.

662
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:46,960
Okay, that's nice.

663
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:47,740
That's it.

664
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,260
That's pretty good.

665
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,580
I like that, actually.

666
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:01,900
He just follows me in his own car.

667
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,260
No one's safe from me.

668
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:10,960
The baby is easier to kill.

669
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,540
It's just stomping on some bugs, guys.

670
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:16,560
No big deal.

671
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:17,980
Did I kill him?

672
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:19,600
Wait, no, I didn't.

673
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:22,940
Alright, don't worry.

674
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:24,020
Don't worry.

675
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:26,640
You're gonna be a widow now.

676
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:27,540
Actually, no.

677
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,440
Let's just kids have the orphans.

678
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:30,440
Alright.

679
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:31,280
Nice.

680
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,480
The kids have more loot.

681
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:37,500
No, the moms have more loot, so it makes more sense to just
kill the mom.

682
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,200
The kids don't give as much.

683
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:40,580
See?

684
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,480
Look, the mom gave me, like, venom and the exoskeleton.

685
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,100
Alright, we're gonna loot this.

686
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:48,920
Loot.

687
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:49,680
Loot.

688
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:50,600
The desert gets off.

through that as expected we'll have to take a detour via

694
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:40,140
east valley

695
00:57:48,390 --> 00:58:09,870

old man shut up and sit down we're moving out yeah he's a

698
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:51,230

army old man is that what the lucky charms for what but you

699
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:58,890

00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:11,490
pulled on him hold on please tell me you're joking that was
30 years ago it's your fault thief wait why was it his fault

Wait, what?

703
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:18,030
How did you shift the blame to him?

704
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:21,470
He's literally just like the fucking third wheel.

705
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:27,530
But if the royal army gets in my way, I'll gladly take them
on.

706
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:31,010
I'd give my left arm for a chance at Supreme Commander Zayu.

707
00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:34,150
Poor man.

708
00:59:34,350 --> 00:59:36,250
He gets like fucking...

709
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:37,690

710
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:39,990
Who the fuck is this guy?

711
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:43,670
Look, he's just catching some strays

712
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:48,410
Who's this game?

713
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:55,970
Oh my god, Papa!

surprised he's fucking not wearing anything.

716
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:09,650
Bro, he's got a flexit man.

717
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:12,550
If he hasn't, he's got to show it.

718
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:16,170
How the fuck do I get there?

719
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:18,250
It's like here.

720
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:21,310
There's no fall damage anyway.

721
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:25,790
Oh my god!

722
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:29,310
Guys, it'll be okay.

723
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:31,530

See?

725
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:34,670

I knew it.

735
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:46,870
It's like I didn't fuck up.

736
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:49,110
We actually did it.

737
01:01:49,690 --> 01:01:50,050
Woo!

738
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:56,130
I am determined.

739
01:01:56,350 --> 01:01:57,770
Where's a horse what you need?

740
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:02,530
If only you had a jump, bot that could jump.

741
01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:03,370
No!

742
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:10,170
Okay, let's get the jump pot out.

743
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:13,350
All right, now we need the jump pot.

744
01:02:14,650 --> 01:02:16,770
There is a jump that I cannot make.

745
01:02:20,350 --> 01:02:20,770
No!

746
01:02:21,550 --> 01:02:22,770
Okay, okay.

747
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:27,170
Guys, guys, there's a delay when it comes to jumping.

748
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:28,590
Did you guys know that?

749
01:02:30,850 --> 01:02:32,530
What the fuck am I?

750
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:33,030
Okay.

751
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:34,050
Okay.

752
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:37,010
There's like a delay you don't understand!

753
01:02:37,790 --> 01:02:39,510
Like, what is this bullshit?

754
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:49,640
Are you fucking- I- Bro!

756
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:51,720
No!

757
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:54,620
Game over!

758
01:02:58,210 --> 01:03:02,350
Okay, okay, guys, there's a delay!

759
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:05,090
Like, what the fuck?

760
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:08,450
Okay, all right, okay, we're gonna track it.

761
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:12,990
There's a delay in jumping.

762
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:14,550
I swear to God.

763
01:03:15,590 --> 01:03:17,430
I swear to God.

764
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:19,490
Okay.

765
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:22,570
Like, I can't stop the delay.

766
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:25,170
The go!

767
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:26,290
What?

768
01:03:26,930 --> 01:03:28,330
This is bullshit.

769
01:03:28,770 --> 01:03:30,550
This is actually bullshit.

770
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:34,470
Okay, here we go.

771
01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:36,730
Oh my god.

772
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:37,330
I did it.

773
01:03:37,370 --> 01:03:38,710
I fucking did it.

774
01:03:39,830 --> 01:03:40,670
Guys, I beat.

775
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:48,650
hard mode guys this is the hardest part of the game this is
this is the hardest part of the video game chat you don't

778
01:04:10,330 --> 01:04:16,110
cover-up from the government the government doesn't want
people to know how good I am at video games so they

779
01:04:16,110 --> 01:04:29,670
purposely add a nurse for me like it's not a conspiracy if
it's true the government purposely added lag so I wouldn't

780
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:31,650
so I wouldn't hit those jumps.

781
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:36,530
They added latency on my jumps.

782
01:04:42,690 --> 01:04:45,470
They didn't want my true power to show up.

783
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:46,890
They're pretty much everything.

784
01:04:47,770 --> 01:04:49,030
She's catching on.

785
01:04:49,410 --> 01:04:50,470
Quick, somebody.

01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:55,910
How's the volume so far?

787
01:04:56,050 --> 01:04:58,610
Is it like, oh, loud enough or too loud?

788
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:00,150
Just want to be sure.

789
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:03,830

Thank you.

799
01:06:05,970 --> 01:06:09,350
They're hiding my true power in my power level chat.

800
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:11,830
It's the government.

801
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:15,330
That is a conspiracy I'm willing to get behind in.

802
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:16,190
Wait.

803
01:06:17,130 --> 01:06:17,890
Okay, there you go.

804
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:19,550
Alright, now I don't have any repair kits.

805
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:20,530
This is gonna be a little bad.

806
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:22,350
Am I going the right way?

807
01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:24,670
It's like here, right?

808
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:25,930
The East Valley?

809
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:26,930
Yeah, alright.

810
01:06:27,030 --> 01:06:27,470
It's here.

811
01:06:30,650 --> 01:06:38,090
we're gonna get rid of the scorpions all right we're gonna
make more orphans eventually those orphans are gonna find

812
01:06:38,090 --> 01:06:45,830
the the moms that i spared and then i'm gonna and then
they're gonna thank me all right and then i'm gonna kill the

813
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:55,710
kids here so then the the mom can adopt the orphans that i
made behind me and then there i saw the orphan problem and

814
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:58,950
then they're gonna like love each from the trauma they built
together.

815
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:05,200
What's this?

816
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:11,640
They're gonna thank me for thank me for saving them.

817
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:15,420
Their family bond is gonna be stronger than blood.

818
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:17,620
Because I basically...

819
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:19,820
Oh, the sand fall.

820
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,520
I did a risky mission.

821
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:25,220
Give me the money.

822
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:27,440
Thank you.

823
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:29,520
I only do this for the money.

824
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:35,160
Wait, is that bad guy?

825
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:37,540
Oh, that's so pretty.

826
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:40,300
That's fucked.

827
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:41,860
It's not fucked up!

828
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:45,360
Because if you don't have more...

829
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:53,440
It's only fucked up because you still have empathy.

830
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:57,600
Okay, wait.

831
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:04,040
Can I have him, like, shoot things for me?

832
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:09,750
It's called practicality.

833
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:12,070
Nice, let me...

834
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:14,850
So it's extra fucked up.

835
01:08:17,530 --> 01:08:18,610
Okay, let's grab this.

836
01:08:18,690 --> 01:08:19,510
I want the gems.

837
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:23,670
I like how I can farm these things without having to get off
the...

838
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:24,890
Get off the jumper bot.

839
01:08:25,570 --> 01:08:26,750
Is there anything above me?

840
01:08:27,230 --> 01:08:28,710
I feel like there's something above me.

841
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:32,210
That's even more fucked up.

842
01:08:33,010 --> 01:08:35,370
God, you sound like somebody that has moros.

843
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:38,970
Who still has that?

844
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:47,430
What's over here?

845
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:50,490
Is this, like, a secret area?

846
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:53,290
No, I don't know if I should go this way.

847
01:08:53,410 --> 01:08:54,410
I'm not going this way.

848
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:01,350
They're children?

849
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:07,170
I thought Morales got patched.

850
01:09:07,370 --> 01:09:07,770
Oh my god.

851
01:09:08,190 --> 01:09:09,490
Morales in 2024.

852
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:10,910
Morality.

853
01:09:11,830 --> 01:09:14,170
This is why we got rid of the morality system.

854
01:09:18,130 --> 01:09:19,390
It's actually true.

855
01:09:19,470 --> 01:09:20,810
I don't know if you guys noticed this.

856
01:09:21,130 --> 01:09:24,190
But like, I feel like more and more recent games.

857
01:09:24,690 --> 01:09:27,050
Like games that used to have a morality system.

858
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:29,230
They got rid of the morality system.

859
01:09:29,310 --> 01:09:32,150
Because they realized gamers don't care about.

860
01:09:35,190 --> 01:09:36,890
Have you guys noticed that?

861
01:09:37,290 --> 01:09:43,130
Like, some games that used to have, like, morality system,
they, like, patched it.

862
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:44,170
They got rid of it.

863
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:47,130
We go to any things.

864
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:51,030
We definitely need, like, repair kit, guys.

865
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:52,550
Okay, repair kit.

866
01:09:53,470 --> 01:09:54,650
Oh, wait, no, I shouldn't sell it.

867
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:56,050
I want to buy a repair kit.

868
01:09:56,810 --> 01:09:58,050
Okay, I'm going to buy two.

869
01:09:58,930 --> 01:09:59,670
We might as well.

870
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:00,310
We don't...

871
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:01,450
We have a lot of money, right?

872
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:02,410
Yeah, we have a lot.

873
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:02,990
Thank you.

874
01:10:04,810 --> 01:10:15,210
yeah undertale yeah but do you remember do you know how old
undertale is a lot of like more recent triple a well i would

875
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:19,950
say triple a games but a lot of like more recent video games
have gotten rid of it

876
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:32,710
gta would need more of a cascade lies not far to the west of
here it's a sight to behold definitely worth a look while

877
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:38,530
we're in might as well while we're here guys i'm still okay
okay

878
01:10:43,770 --> 01:10:56,070

879
01:11:00,290 --> 01:11:05,570

880
01:11:06,450 --> 01:11:06,690
Okay.

881
01:11:09,210 --> 01:11:09,490
Okay.

882
01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:12,350
I blame the government.

883
01:11:12,610 --> 01:11:14,830
The government is adding latency to my game.

884
01:11:16,430 --> 01:11:17,670
I swear to God.

885
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:19,390
It's not me.

886
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:22,630
This must be the East Valley by all appearances.

887
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:24,070
There's a lag.

888
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:24,970
I swear.

889
01:11:25,790 --> 01:11:27,010
There's like lag.

890
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:28,870
Oh, it's so tall.

891
01:11:29,770 --> 01:11:32,310
No way we could have climbed up there without the jump bot.

892
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:43,330
and the legendary spring awaits on the other side right i
doubt it'll be quite that simple even so it's a big step

893
01:11:43,330 --> 01:11:48,670
forward well what are we waiting for let's get up there

894
01:11:52,260 --> 01:12:04,020
okay we gotta jump okay we also gotta heal uh we did it we
healed all right here we go how do we get up there do we

895
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:06,420
jump from here would barely even tickle.

896
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:08,560
Okay, we got this.

897
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:10,160
Look at that.

898
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,280
I'm figuring it out.

899
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:17,380
See, look at, this is what my true power is like without the
government trying to nerf me.

900
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:19,500
Look.

901
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:23,480
Oh, and then suddenly there's no latency between my jumps.

902
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:24,800
Like, what?

903
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:25,960
Coincidence?

904
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:27,320
I think that.

905
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,320
Don't fall out.

906
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:32,240
Defeat Toki platforms.

907
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:34,740
Come on.

908
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:35,480
Come on, thief.

909
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:36,600
Tired already?

910
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:40,000
You need to get off your butt more than once every hundred
years.

911
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:45,000
Easy for you to say from a jump, but...

912
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:45,220
Huh?

913
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:49,900
What?

914
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:54,460
Whoa!

915
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:56,220
Shoot the rock!

916
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:58,500
Oh, jump?

917
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:03,020
Close!

918
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:04,700
Okay, just shot the rock.

919
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:05,780
It's a rock.

920
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:06,500
Papa!

921
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:07,460
oh

922
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:21,440
Don't worry just keep going I'm sorry like I like how the
the guy in the far left just doesn't have a fucking nose He

923
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,400
just has two holes like what?

924
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:32,890
Pike sketch all their faces for me, would you?

925
01:13:34,030 --> 01:13:36,010
Coming right up

926
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:43,840
The fuck is he what what is?

927
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:44,820
What is he doing?

928
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,700
They have good team chemistry.

929
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,060
What a team.

930
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:50,400
Wait,

931
01:13:57,690 --> 01:13:58,390
they know who I am?

932
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:06,060
That's me.

933
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,720
How does he know who I am?

934
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:16,440
Everyone just...

935
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:18,720
Oh, I've beaten him up before.

936
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:27,760
You know, this guy waxes, too, because, like, there's
literally no hair on any of them.

937
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:29,320
My God.

938
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:31,380
That's swimmers.

939
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:38,300
He waxes all the hair off except for the mustache.

940
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,680
And be ready to run if it doesn't work.

941
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:42,660
Okie dokie.

942
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,560
Dokie, please.

943
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:47,940
Look, there's no hair anywhere.

944
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:49,020
It's the swimmers.

945
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:53,800
Hydrodynamic.

946
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:55,720
The swimmers?

947
01:14:56,180 --> 01:14:57,960
As in the famous bandits?

948
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:03,500
I should have known those crooks would play dirty.

949
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,680
Giggles, thank you for the super chat.

950
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,200
Your very first super chat, too.

951
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:09,160
Thank you, thank you.

952
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:12,100
Yeah, I remember wishing you a happy birthday last time.

953
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:15,760
Just want to say thank you for making my birthday so special
last Thursday.

954
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,380
Here's a little something to show my love and support.

955
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:20,140
I'm excited for everything you have in the future.

956
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:20,780
Thank you.

957
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:21,780
Thank you for the super chat.

958
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:22,760
Thank you.

959
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,940
So it has a single boulder connects with it.

960
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:26,800
Oh, right.

961
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:31,060
Oh, yeah.

962
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:33,360
I remember asking how you guys think the sound was now.

963
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:36,240
But then I just didn't look at chat.

964
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:38,500
Oh, shit.

965
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:39,440
It's 2D time.

966
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,040
Is the sound okay?

967
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:42,620
Weew.

968
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:44,560
I can speed run this.

969
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:45,280
You.

970
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:46,340
Oh, God.

971
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:46,780
Whoa.

972
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:49,460
Oh, I don't know.

973
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:51,060
Oh, what the fuck?

974
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:53,440
Where was the where was the fucking?

975
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:54,880
Assist!

976
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:57,760
Oh, you guys said it was good?

977
01:15:57,820 --> 01:15:58,280
You're welcome.

978
01:15:58,840 --> 01:15:59,100
Huh?

979
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,340
It's Donkey Kong time.

980
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,380
It's time to beat him up.

981
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:11,680
Shoot him!

982
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:14,560
I thought I actually heard Beelzebub talking to me.

983
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:15,340
Oh, yeah.

984
01:16:15,620 --> 01:16:16,360
Wait, you're right.

985
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:17,920
It's because our bond grows stronger.

986
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,600
Oh, I had to go this way.

987
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:28,640
I had to go backwards.

988
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:31,040
Guys, guys, guys!

989
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:33,620
It's not a skill.

990
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:34,600

I made machines.

999
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:46,210
The machines have been doing all my work for so long.

1000
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:48,050

Can I combo him so he can't do anything?

01:17:53,130 --> 01:17:53,830
No, I can't.

I remember how to dodge guys.

1013
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:19,710
Can't track him.

1014
01:18:20,130 --> 01:18:21,550
Guys, I can't see him.

1015
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:22,650
Where is he?

1016
01:18:22,690 --> 01:18:24,290
Is he in front of me?

1017
01:18:27,550 --> 01:18:29,410
You despicable feed.

1018
01:18:29,650 --> 01:18:31,690
Attacking poor defenseless humans.

1019
01:18:33,150 --> 01:18:34,170
Cream on.

1020
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:36,610
You're the ones who started this fight.

1021
01:18:37,790 --> 01:18:39,550
Oh, yeah, I was like nut level.

1022
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:42,950
How would you like me to finish it?

1023
01:18:47,350 --> 01:18:47,870
Guppy?

1024
01:18:49,410 --> 01:18:50,670
Why are you calling guppy?

1025
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:52,030
Oh, shit, what about gun?

1026
01:18:52,990 --> 01:18:54,090
That's not fair?

1027
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,080
Dang it.

1028
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:02,660
Were these just shot his, like, leader?

1029
01:19:04,180 --> 01:19:06,180
Oh, it was like a smoke screen.

1030
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:08,040
Oh, that's smart.

1031
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:11,800
I mean, they could have shot him, but like, I guess that
works, too.

1032
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:16,840
If there's one thing they're good at, it's running away.

1033
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:20,600
Alright, nice.

1034
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:23,260

1035
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:25,520
Prince, are you unharmed?

1036
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:26,800
I did it.

1037
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:30,500
You think those losers could take me?

1038
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:33,640
Of course, I'm literally bulletproof.

1039
01:19:34,180 --> 01:19:35,340
We've established this.

1040
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:36,200

You've got a gap for drawing, son.

1048
01:20:32,350 --> 01:20:35,710

01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:38,890

Even though they're a bunch of weaklings, they keep picking
fights with me.

1076
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:01,900
Please, if I keep spamming.

1078
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:06,920
I don't know.

1079
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,560
Guys, that's quicksand.

1080
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,660
I don't know if you guys know this, but visually, that's
quicksand.

1081
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:23,360
So that's why there's a bridge.

1082
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:25,800
Why did they build a bridge for sand?

1083
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:26,960
Are they stupid?

1084
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:32,100

1092
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:51,160

Just give me infinite ammo.

1103
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:14,540
God off guard puts you at a disadvantage.

Wee.

1110
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:33,400
Is this it?

1111
01:24:33,940 --> 01:24:35,620
Wait, did I went the wrong way?

1112
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:38,440
Wait, how do I get there?

1113
01:24:39,620 --> 01:24:40,600
Wait, what?

1114
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:41,460
What?

1115
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:43,760
How do I get there?

1116
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:47,240
I'm so...

1117
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:49,920

1118
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:51,400
Is there a way downstairs?

1119
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:53,580
Or is that dead end?

1120
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:56,220

Down is up, guys.

1124
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:03,980
It took some real damage back there.

1125
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:04,640
Oh, shit.

1126
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:06,860
Sorry, I keep forgetting there's no fault.

1127
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:10,200
It's not this.

1128
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:12,040
Oh, do I have to use, like, the tank?

1129
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:14,160
You have to use the tank.

1130
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:19,520
Yes, I knew it.

1131
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,080
I fucking knew it.

1132
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:23,540
When there's a hole, there's a goal.

1133
01:25:33,090 --> 01:25:43,590
I don't understand why I don't just like cross out the four

old sheriff oh he's 61

1135
01:26:02,230 --> 01:26:11,830
however when we ran the fingerprints of this sheriff Rao
through a centralized database we discovered a far more

1136
01:26:11,830 --> 01:26:22,810
shocking truth Rao was a mere alias this man's Your name
should be familiar to every citizen of this kingdom.

1137
01:26:24,410 --> 01:26:29,890
For it belongs to the military genus who became a general of
the Royal Army at the tender age of 27.

The legendary super soldier who protected Sandland from
rebels and outlaws alike.

1141
01:26:41,050 --> 01:26:45,270
Fame for his mercy and gentlemanly conduct toward even his
fiercest enemies.

1142
01:26:45,470 --> 01:26:45,950
Mercy?

1143
01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:48,970

Okay, let me kill these raptors real fast.

For them.

1195
01:31:58,050 --> 01:31:59,250
There we go.

1196
01:31:59,630 --> 01:31:59,750
Muddy!

1197
01:32:00,210 --> 01:32:01,930
Oh, there, these kids are still alive.

1198
01:32:02,770 --> 01:32:03,290
Phew.

1199
01:32:03,990 --> 01:32:05,250
The kids were alive.

1200
01:32:06,010 --> 01:32:07,630
It's just a prank.

1201
01:32:09,010 --> 01:32:09,830
It's not murder.

1202
01:32:10,770 --> 01:32:13,150
Why do people always say murder when you...

1203
01:32:16,890 --> 01:32:19,750
I don't understand why people think it's murder when
someone...

1204
01:32:19,770 --> 01:32:22,070
simply just dies beside me.

1205
01:32:22,670 --> 01:32:26,770
Like, what if they just had a heart attack and I was just
wrong place, wrong time?

1206
01:32:27,470 --> 01:32:28,790
Sharko, thank you for the super chat.

1207
01:32:29,010 --> 01:32:29,770
Thank you, thank you.

1208
01:32:29,770 --> 01:32:32,750
I didn't know that Ingoons were in this game.

1209
01:32:32,890 --> 01:32:33,570
Thank you, the super chat.

1210
01:32:33,630 --> 01:32:34,490
Thank you, thank you.

1211
01:32:35,870 --> 01:32:37,490
It's only a attempt.

1212
01:32:37,570 --> 01:32:40,530
Yeah, it was only an attempt because he survived.

1213
01:32:43,050 --> 01:32:43,610
They died.

1214
01:32:43,750 --> 01:32:44,290
Yeah, they died.

1215
01:32:44,370 --> 01:32:46,270
They could have just had a heart attack.

1216
01:32:46,470 --> 01:32:48,270
You don't know that.

1217
01:32:50,410 --> 01:32:53,850
Like, they could literally just have a heart attack.

1218
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:55,230
Looks like we're in for a fight.

1219
01:32:57,530 --> 01:32:59,070
Okay, we gotta make sure we...

1220
01:32:59,070 --> 01:33:01,410
Okay, first off, we have to make sure we hit those.

1221
01:33:02,870 --> 01:33:03,490
Alright, nice.

1222
01:33:03,610 --> 01:33:04,330
We got this tank.

1223
01:33:04,770 --> 01:33:06,210
And then we gotta get that tank.

1224
01:33:08,130 --> 01:33:09,330
Alright, they're only level 7.

1225
01:33:09,490 --> 01:33:10,990
They're practically like babies.

1226
01:33:12,010 --> 01:33:13,770
Okay, then we gotta...

1227
01:33:14,610 --> 01:33:15,890
Shoot the people.

1228
01:33:16,730 --> 01:33:19,750
You know, my fucking controller aim ain't so bad.

1229
01:33:19,770 --> 01:33:22,850
See, look, I did it.

1230
01:33:24,570 --> 01:33:28,870
General Ari, the tank squadron at the checkpoint has been
decimated.

1231
01:33:29,370 --> 01:33:32,230
Everything I touched eyes, not my fault.

1232
01:33:32,390 --> 01:33:33,090
Hey, what?

1233
01:33:35,470 --> 01:33:38,070
General Shiva's tank took them out and continued on.

1234
01:33:39,610 --> 01:33:41,850
Toki's tank versus coffee.

1235
01:33:44,390 --> 01:33:45,750
New measurement.

1236
01:33:46,330 --> 01:33:47,130
Who would win?

1237
01:33:49,170 --> 01:33:49,630
Oh, shit.

1238
01:33:49,770 --> 01:34:00,430
loot loot loot loot loot yeah whoa that's so much stuff for
my new tank just run over it doesn't matter to me prince see

1239
01:34:00,430 --> 01:34:07,450
the radio tower on top of that hill yeah that's our target
okay this will be a piece of cake i know it's gonna be so

1240
01:34:07,450 --> 01:34:18,330
fucking easy just yet the army must be aware of our general
location oh my god there's my taxi in the area oh it's just

1241
01:34:18,330 --> 01:34:23,350
a oh it's just a Uh, do I have anything I need to buy?

1242
01:34:24,450 --> 01:34:26,370
I guess I'll buy another repair kit.

1243
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:29,210
I feel like that's the only thing I need.

1244
01:34:30,510 --> 01:34:30,510
Yeah!

1245
01:34:30,790 --> 01:34:32,430
Wait, there's a base there!

1246
01:34:33,230 --> 01:34:34,210
I might as well!

1247
01:34:34,650 --> 01:34:36,510
God, I wish I could steal that guy's dinosaur.

1248
01:34:36,850 --> 01:34:38,430
It's so much faster than a tank.

1249
01:34:40,330 --> 01:34:42,530
Because the heart attacks when they gaze upon you.

1250
01:34:42,730 --> 01:34:43,950
So, no, no, no!

1251
01:34:44,490 --> 01:34:47,390
It's not my fault they died because I look so fine.

1252
01:34:47,530 --> 01:34:48,110
Like, come on.

1253
01:34:51,950 --> 01:34:54,130
Is that truly a crime?

1254
01:34:55,710 --> 01:35:00,150
Because I look so beautiful that they died of heart attacks.

1255
01:35:00,650 --> 01:35:01,370
Like, come on.

1256
01:35:01,470 --> 01:35:03,350
It's because they died of pure beauty.

1257
01:35:05,490 --> 01:35:06,770
It's not a crime.

1258
01:35:07,790 --> 01:35:10,150
So, what are you going to tell everyone?

1259
01:35:11,410 --> 01:35:12,250
The truth.

1260
01:35:12,890 --> 01:35:14,730
And what's been on my mind.

1261
01:35:15,150 --> 01:35:16,590
What's on your mind, old man?

1262
01:35:16,610 --> 01:35:19,750
I've got a bad feeling about it.

1263
01:35:19,770 --> 01:35:33,250
this beauty is a crime we should keep our distance from the
army base unless necessary I bet they've got loads of loot

1264
01:35:33,250 --> 01:35:40,470
in there I know they have so much loot that but somehow I
doubt they'd take kindly to intruders I'm gonna not listen

1265
01:35:40,470 --> 01:35:49,450
to him we'll run up out of it please at least try to be
sneaky about it sensei thank you for the super chat thank

1266
01:35:49,450 --> 01:36:02,330
you thank you do i have to be sneaky i'm gonna pretend i
didn't hear what he said i'm gonna go straight in or the

1267
01:36:02,330 --> 01:36:10,870
terrain's to your disadvantage keep moving until you're in a
better spot no i don't need a move that won't stop me

1268
01:36:10,870 --> 01:36:16,350
exactly look at that I run away.

1269
01:36:16,550 --> 01:36:17,890
I can't level up, you idiot.

1270
01:36:19,210 --> 01:36:21,190
God, oh man, it's all about the lovers.

1271
01:36:23,050 --> 01:36:23,530
Okay.

1272
01:36:23,850 --> 01:36:24,630
I almost got it.

1273
01:36:24,770 --> 01:36:25,270
Oh, nice.

1274
01:36:25,990 --> 01:36:26,790
See, look at that.

1275
01:36:27,150 --> 01:36:28,450
Nothing to worry about.

1276
01:36:29,710 --> 01:36:30,410
Oh, shit.

1277
01:36:30,570 --> 01:36:31,330
Okay, I didn't miss.

1278
01:36:32,090 --> 01:36:32,610
There we go.

1279
01:36:33,230 --> 01:36:36,110
And then I told you guys.

1280
01:36:36,390 --> 01:36:38,130
See, nothing to worry about.

1281
01:36:39,470 --> 01:36:40,890
Who needs stealth?

1282
01:36:42,290 --> 01:36:44,870
Who needs stealth when I have all this fucking loot?

1283
01:36:45,250 --> 01:36:47,090
Oh, I can rob them, too.

1284
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:47,970
Give me a sec.

1285
01:36:48,110 --> 01:36:52,570
We're going to go to the base and rob them.

1286
01:36:53,070 --> 01:36:53,910
Give me a sec, guys.

1287
01:36:54,270 --> 01:36:55,670
This is very important.

1288
01:36:57,130 --> 01:36:57,650
Wee.

1289
01:36:58,330 --> 01:37:02,370
There should be nobody here anymore, because I didn't kill
them.

1290
01:37:02,510 --> 01:37:03,570
They ran away.

1291
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:06,230
Yes.

1292
01:37:07,190 --> 01:37:07,950
Got more loot.

1293
01:37:08,510 --> 01:37:09,470
Loot, loot, loot, loot, loot.

1294
01:37:11,590 --> 01:37:14,070
Why would I run away when I know I'm better?

1295
01:37:15,690 --> 01:37:18,990
Are there royal army soldiers all over Sandland?

1296
01:37:19,510 --> 01:37:21,030
There's even a bunch near our village.

1297
01:37:22,610 --> 01:37:24,610
Most of them are stationed near the royal capital.

1298
01:37:25,510 --> 01:37:28,150
It can be a lot more hit and miss the farther you get away
with it.

1299
01:37:28,610 --> 01:37:29,450
No, I can't.

1300
01:37:29,730 --> 01:37:33,990
You'll also see supply units traveling around as they
transport goods to bases.

1301
01:37:35,330 --> 01:37:38,770
Those are probably the ones who pass near our village.

1302
01:37:40,550 --> 01:37:41,070
Alright.

1303
01:37:41,550 --> 01:37:41,890
Nice.

1304
01:37:42,470 --> 01:37:43,570
Look at how the loot I got.

1305
01:37:45,670 --> 01:37:46,810
listen to him.

1306
01:37:47,210 --> 01:37:47,910
Wait, can I beat this?

1307
01:37:48,390 --> 01:37:49,790
Ugh, there we go.

1308
01:37:53,310 --> 01:37:57,990
If I had listened to him, I wouldn't have got all this good
loot.

1309
01:37:59,390 --> 01:38:00,670
How do I get up there, though?

1310
01:38:01,470 --> 01:38:02,670
I should grab the tank.

1311
01:38:03,910 --> 01:38:04,330
Loot, loot, loot.

1312
01:38:04,670 --> 01:38:05,270
Stealth is for the weak.

1313
01:38:05,530 --> 01:38:06,010
Exactly!

1314
01:38:07,070 --> 01:38:07,690
Here we go.

1315
01:38:08,010 --> 01:38:11,290
Stealth is for people who are weak and don't know how to...

1316
01:38:12,450 --> 01:38:15,210
And know they can't beat them up by pure strength.

1317
01:38:15,670 --> 01:38:16,250
From the army.

1318
01:38:16,430 --> 01:38:18,930
At least that was sort of fun.

1319
01:38:23,030 --> 01:38:25,070
Stealth is for cowards.

1320
01:38:26,510 --> 01:38:29,310
Don't, yeah, this is why you don't listen to Elder.

1321
01:38:31,950 --> 01:38:33,870
They don't know what's good for you.

1322
01:38:36,030 --> 01:38:38,090
Your information is outdated.

1323
01:38:38,730 --> 01:38:41,870
It's because this old man is so fucking weak.

1324
01:38:42,310 --> 01:38:46,330
So that's why he was not confident in beating the army up.

1325
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:52,420
Let me grab this.

1326
01:38:52,580 --> 01:38:54,400
Oh my god, I can have a dino!

1327
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:57,100
Alright guys.

1328
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:58,860
What do you think about stopping by that campsite?

1329
01:38:58,980 --> 01:39:00,120
They're using ourselves.

1330
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:01,620
This is my.

1331
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:02,880
This is better.

1332
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:04,140
That's open to all travelers.

1333
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:06,680
Like, what do I do with the camp?

1334
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:07,840
Anyway.

1335
01:39:09,140 --> 01:39:12,080
Like, I don't need a rest because I never get off the...

1336
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:14,240
I never get off the fucking tank.

1337
01:39:16,420 --> 01:39:16,940
Finally.

1338
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:19,800
Riding my true...

1339
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:28,560
riding my true vehicle the guy they give us super chat thank

1340

away just close your eyes how do you get murdered just close

1342
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:53,180
your eyes no Hey, Rao, we've been spotted.

1343
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:55,240
Wait, he has a shield.

1344
01:39:56,260 --> 01:40:00,620
Does the shield actually stop a fucking cannon shot?

1345
01:40:01,540 --> 01:40:02,800
But we can still take them.

1346
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:06,580
Hold up.

1347
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:09,200
Looks like they've got us around it.

1348
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:09,840
They do?

1349
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:12,680
Wait, who's that?

1350
01:40:14,380 --> 01:40:16,120
Wait, oh, that's the general.

1351
01:40:16,660 --> 01:40:17,140
General Ace.

1352

1361
01:41:41,740 --> 01:41:51,800
looks like they disabled it in advance to keep us from using
it they read us like a book This commander is a pro.

1362
01:41:53,020 --> 01:41:55,380
So you're saying this was all for nothing?

1363
01:41:56,420 --> 01:41:58,160
No, I think we can get it fixed.

1364
01:41:58,360 --> 01:42:01,300
We all know women on the internet aren't real.

1365
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:04,920
It's all just men with voice changes.

1366
01:42:06,180 --> 01:42:10,160
Can I repair it?

1367
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:11,380
I have so much materials.

1368
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:14,620
Yeah, I was going to say, I've fucking been like scavenging
for so long.

1369
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:16,500
There's no way I don't have materials.

1370
01:42:24,190 --> 01:42:25,030
Am I a man?

1371
01:42:25,930 --> 01:42:27,790
Yes, we're all...

1372
01:42:28,350 --> 01:42:30,410
Women aren't real on the internet, guys.

1373
01:42:30,510 --> 01:42:31,150
This is Shiva.

1374
01:42:32,510 --> 01:42:33,950
Former General Shiva.

1375
01:42:35,390 --> 01:42:38,710
I have something I want to tell the people of this country.

1376
01:42:39,230 --> 01:42:41,270
If you'll let me transmit it.

1377
01:42:42,750 --> 01:42:43,030
Yes.

1378
01:42:43,670 --> 01:42:44,790
Right away, please.

1379
01:42:46,730 --> 01:42:51,730
We have just received radio contact from a man claiming to
be General Shiva himself.

1380
01:42:53,310 --> 01:42:53,770
What?

1381
01:42:53,770 --> 01:42:54,170
What?

1382
01:42:55,730 --> 01:42:57,810
He has a message for you all.

1383
01:42:58,070 --> 01:43:04,730
And while we have not been able to confirm his identity, we
have agreed to transmit his words live on our...

1384
01:43:04,730 --> 01:43:05,570
Don't worry, I'll always be your bro.

1385
01:43:07,290 --> 01:43:09,970
I'm actually surprised they let them trans...

1386
01:43:09,970 --> 01:43:13,090
Like, let them transmit their his message.

1387
01:43:13,310 --> 01:43:18,730
First, allow me to sincerely apologize to you all for any
distress I may have caused.

1388
01:43:20,790 --> 01:43:22,230
Units, cut the engines!

1389
01:43:22,590 --> 01:43:23,230
Make it quiet!

1390
01:43:27,290 --> 01:43:36,450
confess to the crime of stealing a tank but unlike what you
were told previously i have not attacked any villages with

1391
01:43:36,450 --> 01:43:47,910
it i swear this on my life yeah i'm brokey bird i'll always
be a bro spread panic and confusion amid this country i

1392
01:43:47,910 --> 01:43:56,610
intend only to find a legendary spring which i assure you is
no mere fairy tale for this country cannot withstand any

1393
01:43:56,610 --> 01:44:11,470
more drought spring did he say spring what is he even
talking about so please just allow me to finish this mission

1394
01:44:11,470 --> 01:44:19,750
without interference when i find the spring i promise to
make its location public okay but like is this like the only

1395
01:44:19,750 --> 01:44:28,430
spring in the whole fucking world wouldn't that be like I
feel like the spring will get like quickly depleted because

1396
01:44:28,430 --> 01:44:38,590
humans are greedy there's no way the spring is gonna feed
the entire population in sad land person on an entirely

1397
01:44:38,590 --> 01:44:39,650
different subject

1398
01:44:42,970 --> 01:44:51,770
though this doesn't absolve my role in causing that
explosion 30 years ago I've learned the truth behind it yeah

1399
01:44:51,770 --> 01:45:06,270
it would dry up in like a week wouldn't it it could be a
legendary spring oh my god just say it mr sheba a question

call him out i'd be like bro guys by the way i sort of

1401
01:45:14,010 --> 01:45:19,850

save you guys and we actually wiped off the only race that

1402
01:45:19,850 --> 01:45:25,430

because i already forgot you're that irrelevant to me

never to allow that criminal to speak freely on air again

1404
01:45:37,050 --> 01:45:45,150

truth behind that explosion why didn't he just reveal it

1405
01:45:45,150 --> 01:45:55,370
this was the only time he's ever gonna be allowed in the air
like he should have just revealed everything looking for do

1406
01:45:55,370 --> 01:46:06,150

This is why you're Dragoon...

1414
01:46:56,550 --> 01:47:01,130
This is why you're Dragoon 1.

1415
01:47:03,650 --> 01:47:05,030
Let's see.

1416
01:47:06,250 --> 01:47:09,590
You're too low level for even upgrades.

1417
01:47:10,450 --> 01:47:11,470
I need...

1418
01:47:11,470 --> 01:47:13,250
Neglected again.

1419
01:47:13,790 --> 01:47:15,530
He's already perfect.

1420
01:47:18,610 --> 01:47:20,570
Can I just jump down?

1421
01:47:22,190 --> 01:47:22,770
Okay, look.

1422
01:47:22,950 --> 01:47:27,230
I know we learned that we can't, but like, what if I...

1423
01:47:27,230 --> 01:47:28,850
Wait, can I just fast travel?

1424
01:47:28,970 --> 01:47:30,350
Oh, no, it's like right over here.

1425
01:47:30,530 --> 01:47:31,550
But what if I, like, watch this.

1426
01:47:31,650 --> 01:47:33,810
It's going to be like, I'm going to Skyrim this.

1427
01:47:35,770 --> 01:47:35,970
There.

1428
01:47:39,770 --> 01:47:41,170
That's why you know I'm a gamer.

1429
01:47:44,010 --> 01:47:45,990
That's why you guys watch me.

1430
01:47:47,570 --> 01:47:50,250
You know other VTubers won't do this.

1431
01:47:54,370 --> 01:47:56,350
I make my own pathways.

1432
01:47:56,770 --> 01:47:59,770
I don't follow what society tells me to.

1433
01:48:06,270 --> 01:48:08,990
Does that mean...

1434
01:48:08,990 --> 01:48:10,070
No one...

1435
01:48:11,590 --> 01:48:13,450
Supreme Commander Zayu, sir.

1436
01:48:15,450 --> 01:48:15,990
Yes, sir.

1437
01:48:16,430 --> 01:48:17,550
I believe General...

1438
01:48:17,570 --> 01:48:19,150
Shiva is very close.

1439
01:48:21,550 --> 01:48:23,290
Not like I think, girl.

1440
01:48:23,490 --> 01:48:25,890
A mere ghost requires no title.

1441
01:48:27,690 --> 01:48:29,630
Don't even try to capture him alive.

1442
01:48:30,430 --> 01:48:30,670
Understand?

1443
01:48:33,330 --> 01:48:33,810
Kill him.

1444
01:48:34,390 --> 01:48:35,010
Once and for all.

1445
01:48:35,010 --> 01:48:35,830
Kill him war.

1446
01:48:36,030 --> 01:48:38,710
Okay, well, I was going to say war hero slash criminal.

1447
01:48:41,210 --> 01:48:42,150
Forgive me.

1448
01:48:42,730 --> 01:48:45,450
But might I ask you just one thing, Supreme Commander?

1449
01:48:46,610 --> 01:48:47,430
What jet?

1450
01:48:47,570 --> 01:48:51,630
Shiva said about the truth behind that explosion.

1451
01:48:53,110 --> 01:48:56,550
You see, my own father was killed in that explosion.

1452
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:04,340
So...

1453
01:49:04,340 --> 01:49:06,680
His father was killed in that explosion.

1454
01:49:07,620 --> 01:49:09,820
Wait, what if he's like secretly the son?

1455
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:13,200
Is he like...

1456
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:14,180
Is this guy 30?

1457
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:17,480
My apologies.

1458
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:30,860
He has daddy and shoes and the other guy's a dad he you
don't don't fall for it he's just pretending to be some

1459
01:49:30,860 --> 01:49:41,180
selfless goody two shoes you can't trust people like that
though if there's one thing we can agree on is that say

1460
01:49:41,180 --> 01:49:54,480
who's a damn rat all right come on guppy I'm right at the
midpoint between Shiva and the royal army.

1461
01:49:55,860 --> 01:49:56,720
Got it, Papa.

1462
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:00,380
There's so many dads.

1463
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:09,660
It's like the first bomb in Fallout.

1464
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:11,960
Enemy tank brigade.

1465
01:50:12,300 --> 01:50:13,260
Oh my god!

1466
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:15,660
They started it!

1467
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:15,960
What?

1468
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:18,500
They're like Voltec.

1469
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:20,260
Prepare to engage.

1470
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:25,080
hurry they shot first dad land

1471
01:50:29,340 --> 01:50:44,350
love how each tank has like different eyes war never changes
take cover behind the rocks and swing around in the other

1472
01:50:44,350 --> 01:50:53,070
direction to attack them wait which which rock whoa which
rock though

1473
01:50:57,290 --> 01:50:59,470
There's so many rocks!

1474
01:51:01,590 --> 01:51:02,370
Wait, is this mine?

1475
01:51:02,650 --> 01:51:03,330
This is mine.

1476
01:51:03,670 --> 01:51:03,990
Sorry.

1477
01:51:04,610 --> 01:51:05,530
I couldn't tell.

1478
01:51:06,070 --> 01:51:07,330
Wait, where's the other tank?

1479
01:51:08,550 --> 01:51:09,470
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1480
01:51:09,470 --> 01:51:10,230
That's the other tank.

1481
01:51:11,010 --> 01:51:11,450
Oh, shit.

1482
01:51:11,910 --> 01:51:12,330
Oh, shit.

1483
01:51:12,430 --> 01:51:13,130
He also missed.

1484
01:51:13,210 --> 01:51:14,050
Back into positions.

1485
01:51:15,470 --> 01:51:15,730
Nice.

1486
01:51:19,010 --> 01:51:19,590
Is that it?

1487
01:51:21,430 --> 01:51:22,290
That's okay.

1488
01:51:22,550 --> 01:51:23,190
He's okay.

1489
01:51:23,290 --> 01:51:24,050
My tank's okay.

1499
01:52:55,450 --> 01:52:56,390
much damage.

01:52:58,010 --> 01:52:59,150
What the fuck?

1501
01:53:02,830 --> 01:53:03,490
Unbelievable.

1502
01:53:04,690 --> 01:53:05,610
He's super human.

1503
01:53:06,670 --> 01:53:07,530
What do you mean he?

1504
01:53:07,730 --> 01:53:09,190
I did majority of the work.

1505
01:53:09,430 --> 01:53:12,190
He disabled our unit with zero loss of life.

1506
01:53:13,490 --> 01:53:15,790
He's exactly the man my father said he was.

1507
01:53:16,970 --> 01:53:18,350
I can't hope to compete.

1508
01:53:18,890 --> 01:53:20,470
He's on a whole different plane.

1509
01:53:21,830 --> 01:53:23,830
Oh, his father said he was?

1510
01:53:23,950 --> 01:53:25,270
Oh, so that means he was...

1511
01:53:25,270 --> 01:53:26,590
That's not the son, then.

1512
01:53:27,970 --> 01:53:31,310
Because he's like, oh, my father said he was...

1513
01:53:31,310 --> 01:53:34,310
So he actually, like, talked to his dad.

1514
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:38,720
Well, I did so...

1515
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:42,920
I finished it so fast that we even get to hear 50% of that
dialogue.

1516
01:53:43,260 --> 01:53:45,900
Despite not answering your question, I have one for you.

1517
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:50,920
On the radio, you mentioned the truth behind the explosion
30 years ago.

1518
01:53:51,620 --> 01:53:52,280
What is it?

1519
01:53:53,080 --> 01:53:55,820
You may not want to hear it.

1520
01:53:56,880 --> 01:54:00,040
I believe it, but I've got no hard proof.

1521
01:54:02,740 --> 01:54:07,340
I, Amare, the son of Apoe, one of your very own officers.

1522
01:54:09,120 --> 01:54:10,260
Please, tell me.

1523
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:13,780
I need to know the truth of my father's death.

1524
01:54:15,740 --> 01:54:17,000
Apoe's son, eh?

1525
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:18,780
I see.

1526
01:54:19,860 --> 01:54:21,020
Very well, then.

1527
01:54:21,860 --> 01:54:22,720
Who's Apoe?

1528
01:54:23,080 --> 01:54:26,880
thief you're our source he should hear it from you

1529
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:39,560
you've got to be must i do everything around here bro all
you do is sit around don't tell me you heard this story from

1530
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:49,720
him yeah he's the demon you take the word of a demon that
doesn't kill if you won't listen to what he has to say i

1531
01:54:49,720 --> 01:54:57,700
can't force you but let me say this world i admit anyone as
honest as these two that's like

1532
01:55:02,120 --> 01:55:09,540
that's so fucked up like because they're like fucking demons
like like what kind of they might as well be like they might

1533
01:55:09,540 --> 01:55:19,880
as well just not be demons at that point i trust them far
far more than any human at least like what the fuck is the

1534
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:28,740
point of having demons if you're not more evil how our fear
and suspicion of the peachy demons should be like the

1535
01:55:28,740 --> 01:55:34,280
benchmark of evil not the fucking middle like

1536
01:55:37,960 --> 01:55:43,320
yeah he means humans are worse we're at the point where like
humans are worse than demons

1537
01:55:49,100 --> 01:55:57,140
what's happening in this game it's so confusing we're in a
land filled with sand and there's tanks and we're trying to

1538
01:55:57,140 --> 01:56:09,340
find water because it's all sand the end guppy do your thing
turn every last one of them into fertilizer with that cannon

1539
01:56:09,340 --> 01:56:14,180
of yours that bounty's as good as ours

1540
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:36,420
damn it what the fuck what you can do that why can't do that
in game no don't tell me there was another tank no it came

1541
01:56:36,420 --> 01:56:45,300
from somewhere above us i'll hop up high and look around
don't worry it's parkour time i can't believe the humans are

1542
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:52,140
worse than demons now like what's the point of being a demon
might as well be a human like they already fucking took our

1543
01:56:52,140 --> 01:57:06,720
jobs the humans took our fucking jobs it's the swimmers
those little oh he's gonna swear beelzebub spotted us time

1544
01:57:06,720 --> 01:57:22,110
to split dang it they got away again i'm gonna pulverize
them next time that beelzebub just saved our lives as any

1545
01:57:22,110 --> 01:57:28,750
demon would do Perhaps it's true that we've misjudged the
demons.

1546
01:57:31,510 --> 01:57:32,890
Alright, I'll hear it.

1547
01:57:33,490 --> 01:57:36,870
Tell me the story of what caused the explosion 30 years ago,
thief.

1548
01:57:38,710 --> 01:57:38,710
Nope.

1549
01:57:39,070 --> 01:57:41,050
Not till I hear the magic word.

Please Don't keep please No commander say was a cold man but

1559
01:58:24,850 --> 01:58:33,470
i can't believe he could be so inhuman well we've set our
peace and sorry but it looks like we'll have to borrow the

1560
01:58:33,470 --> 01:58:34,670
tank a bit longer

1561
01:58:40,360 --> 01:58:50,060
sir are you sure should we really be letting shiva go like
this yes we trust him what do you mean by that we never had

1562
01:58:50,060 --> 01:58:56,540
him to begin bro they he literally we literally beat the
shitter of him and he hadn't even finished his dialogue he

1563
01:58:56,540 --> 01:59:06,300
didn't even finish his plot we almost did until the swimmers
struck out of nowhere that is they took out our tanks then

1564
01:59:06,300 --> 01:59:18,720
fled that is what happened isn't it sir yes sir my god he's
gonna lie no guess I should make my report to Supreme

1565
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:23,440
Commander Zayu no there's something I have to confirm with
the King

1566
01:59:27,860 --> 01:59:40,200
use oh my god finally to pick well i was gonna say why can i
do that yeah why how did i fucking suddenly realize i

1567
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:47,800
learned how to throw rocks i feel like i should know how to
throw rocks originally i've been living in the sand for so

1568
01:59:47,800 --> 02:00:01,360
long use rb and then pick b to pick up a problem ground in
terms of one the throw mode okay yay we can head south let's

1569
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:16,540
go time to head south they're already here that was easy we
did it i'm stronger now oh you're right i leveled up i guess

1570
02:00:22,160 --> 02:00:34,940
everywhere you look one wrong step and you'll be swallowed
up don't worry i'm light of the feather okay we started to

1571
02:00:34,940 --> 02:00:36,360
prove that that was not true

1572
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:45,360
bro he forgot that we drowned in the sand water

1573
02:00:50,840 --> 02:00:56,380
anyway we can't proceed south unless we figure out how to
get We're gonna get water dragons.

1574
02:00:56,620 --> 02:00:58,180
How are we supposed to do that?

1575
02:00:58,580 --> 02:01:01,080
Even the prince- We're gonna be like a dragon boat!

1576
02:01:01,300 --> 02:01:02,900
None of our bots will help either.

1577
02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:06,240
The tank or jump bot would only be even worse off.

1578
02:01:06,360 --> 02:01:07,760
It didn't happen in the cutscene.

1579
02:01:08,040 --> 02:01:08,660
Doesn't count.

1580
02:01:09,160 --> 02:01:09,680
So true.

1581
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:11,620
It'd be easy if we could just fly over it.

1582
02:01:12,240 --> 02:01:13,560
But with planes outlawed.

1583
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:14,960
Yeah, but how would they know?

1584
02:01:15,540 --> 02:01:16,620
How would they know that?

1585
02:01:16,660 --> 02:01:19,280
What if we just, you know, ran really fast?

1586
02:01:19,280 --> 02:01:21,720
Oh, I like those geckos that can run on water.

1587
02:01:22,620 --> 02:01:23,660
Explain, please.

1588
02:01:24,100 --> 02:01:37,050
it kind of felt like i was sinking more slowly while i was
running aha cross before sinking to the point of no return

1589
02:01:37,050 --> 02:01:51,770
hey prince thief let's head back to spino let me guess and
to the rescue again what's wrong with letting add help it's

1590
02:01:51,770 --> 02:02:01,550

yeah there's someone i have to meet right now someone from
the royal army or maybe the news office why would you think

1595
02:02:54,340 --> 02:03:06,180
that ever since the warning about oh my god she's gonna rat
us out for money i'm sure you figured out who we are by now

1596
02:03:06,180 --> 02:03:19,300

on ratting us out how dare she after everything we've been

1597
02:03:19,300 --> 02:03:30,960
through danger by letting you people stay here your concerns
are justified we don't intend to cause you good people any

1598
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:40,820
trouble we promise to never come back now we have two women
left in sandland please allow anne to keep staying here

theft what do you mean you people well in that fine hold on

trying to find a spring and not just for their own personal

can't stand by as the people of this nation suffer any

not my name anymore yeah it's raura raura raura it's this

1606
02:05:04,760 --> 02:05:18,130

english it's so hard to pronounce you heard the man how

1607
02:05:18,130 --> 02:05:25,030
about this 80s this is a toriama style game it's the last
game toriama was involved in perhaps we should hear from the

1608
02:05:25,030 --> 02:05:36,830
entire town before making our final decision i'm sure each
resident has their own thoughts on the matter you're right

1609
02:05:36,830 --> 02:05:45,730
this wasn't something for me to decide to be fair 30 million
yen i would turn myself into not 30 million yen 30 many

1610
02:05:45,730 --> 02:05:57,070
million zen i love how it's like called zen instead of yen
hello Oh my god, two of the four villages.

1611
02:05:57,090 --> 02:05:57,870
Hey, you're with Rao, right?

1612
02:05:58,330 --> 02:05:59,410
Aren't you leaving with him?

1613
02:06:00,510 --> 02:06:03,190
I was considering it, but they shot me down.

1614
02:06:03,410 --> 02:06:05,370
Oh, Diki 12 might be the last one.

1615
02:06:07,130 --> 02:06:08,090
What gives?

1616
02:06:08,230 --> 02:06:09,170
Talk about harsh.

1617
02:06:12,070 --> 02:06:12,550
Right?

1618
02:06:13,210 --> 02:06:16,650
I know they're just trying to protect me, but it still
hurts.

1619
02:06:17,390 --> 02:06:18,330
It's frustrating.

1620
02:06:19,150 --> 02:06:21,910
But part of me is happy to know how much they care.

1621
02:06:23,050 --> 02:06:24,670
So, I've decided to do...

1622
02:06:24,690 --> 02:06:33,230
what i can by looking after this place that way they'll
always have somewhere to go back to sorry if that's not what

1623
02:06:33,230 --> 02:06:45,090
you wanted to hear uh you sound like one of their crew all
right in a good way oh sorry we gave you the wrong idea we

1624
02:06:45,090 --> 02:06:52,550
wanted to tease you for a bit but we're not here to chase
you out we'll be happy to have you here oh my god she's

1625
02:06:52,550 --> 02:06:55,090
getting welcomed in the community Yeah.

1626
02:06:56,670 --> 02:06:58,110
Oh, they don't know.

1627
02:06:58,650 --> 02:07:00,870
We'll know they're isolating her already.

1628
02:07:00,950 --> 02:07:03,530
We've not met anyone as good-hearted as you guys.

1629
02:07:04,390 --> 02:07:07,130
Though BLs would hate being called that.

1630
02:07:07,970 --> 02:07:08,430
Whoa!

1631
02:07:09,830 --> 02:07:10,870
That he would.

1632
02:07:11,070 --> 02:07:12,890
I like how we're like, yeah, we're eavesdropping.

1633
02:07:13,470 --> 02:07:16,170
So anyway, we're glad you'll be standing guard at the
garage.

1634
02:07:17,270 --> 02:07:18,210
And stay put.

1635
02:07:18,930 --> 02:07:20,710
Leave convincing the villagers to us.

1636
02:07:21,310 --> 02:07:22,170
You've got it.

1637
02:07:22,690 --> 02:07:23,150
It's good.

1638
02:07:23,190 --> 02:07:24,490
It's only two other villagers.

1639
02:07:24,690 --> 02:07:35,450
have to wait for a bit but we owe her an apology as we stand
in front of her you might have to wait for a bit but we owe

1640
02:07:35,450 --> 02:07:45,430
her an apology i like how we like just just listen to it in
front of her 80s fuck you 80s is it true that you want to

1641
02:07:45,430 --> 02:07:55,270
report shiva yeah how dare you how else am i gonna look at
that hot lady working on cars yeah that's right I would have

1642
02:07:55,270 --> 02:08:03,470
done it too if mayor It wasn't for those meddling kids And
he was right too We won't submit to the royal army's threats

1643
02:08:03,470 --> 02:08:16,550
Even if it kills us Oh are you still carping about that The
civil wars long since over For 30 years Exile her She wants

1644
02:08:16,550 --> 02:08:27,570
to get rid of And The royal army is still the same bunch of
jackbooted thugs they were back then.

1645
02:08:28,710 --> 02:08:31,630
And I won't stop fighting until that changes.

1646
02:08:33,090 --> 02:08:34,270
Good grief.

1647
02:08:35,490 --> 02:08:40,970
Once his temper flares, all you can do is wait for him to
cool down on his own.

1648
02:08:41,950 --> 02:08:43,270
Just leave him be.

1649
02:08:44,350 --> 02:08:48,730
That said, I don't think we should report General Shiva
either.

1650
02:08:49,710 --> 02:08:54,190
He may have been our enemy in the past, but he and he's
honest.

1651
02:08:54,190 --> 02:08:55,610
He's reformed.

1652
02:08:55,690 --> 02:08:56,190
He's old.

1653
02:08:56,390 --> 02:08:57,030
He's like 60.

1654
02:08:57,170 --> 02:08:58,310
What's he gonna do?

1655
02:08:58,630 --> 02:09:10,210
We can push him If the elderly starts acting up just push
them I trust him Don't push the elderly in real life guys.

1656
02:09:10,650 --> 02:09:12,290
Don't don't listen to Doki advice.

1657
02:09:12,550 --> 02:09:21,750
Sometimes they might be bad If he takes the royals down a
peg in the process, I can die happy Hold on.

1658
02:09:22,290 --> 02:09:24,150
Do you still hate the royal army?

1659
02:09:24,190 --> 02:09:37,870
then you have to ask like i'd ever forgive them for leaving
my hometown in ruins i think i know where i stand now but

1660
02:09:37,870 --> 02:09:47,850

real person like i mean sorry he's not he's not a human he's

1661
02:09:47,850 --> 02:09:50,670
still he's like that's like in like

1662
02:09:56,510 --> 02:09:58,970
Are they all talking without me?

1663
02:10:00,030 --> 02:10:00,790
Oh, he's crying.

1664
02:10:01,030 --> 02:10:01,610
Why are you crying?

1665
02:10:03,090 --> 02:10:04,150
What's wrong, Flika?

1666
02:10:04,970 --> 02:10:06,590
Did you wet the bed again or something?

1667
02:10:08,330 --> 02:10:08,830
No.

1668
02:10:09,690 --> 02:10:15,430
It's just that everyone in town seems mad and I'm scared.

1669
02:10:16,630 --> 02:10:17,150
Forgive me.

1670
02:10:17,510 --> 02:10:18,880
I'm afraid that's all my fault.

1671
02:10:20,270 --> 02:10:20,590
Oh my God.

1672
02:10:20,690 --> 02:10:23,430
For once, I can actually talk in this conversation.

1673
02:10:24,190 --> 02:10:25,350
Instead of eavesdropping.

1674
02:10:25,850 --> 02:10:28,450
It's more like I'm what they're all fighting over.

1675
02:10:28,470 --> 02:10:30,370
Betty, but she doesn't real.

1676
02:10:30,690 --> 02:10:31,990
Thank you for the super chat.

1677
02:10:32,170 --> 02:10:33,450
Thank you.

1678
02:10:33,770 --> 02:10:34,770
Are you guys...

1679
02:10:34,770 --> 02:10:38,930
To be fair, the Saiyans, we're sort of like...

1680
02:10:38,930 --> 02:10:42,090
Didn't really have rights for a very long time.

1681
02:10:42,350 --> 02:10:43,970
That's what we're all trying to decide.

1682
02:10:44,290 --> 02:10:44,990
To be fair.

1683
02:10:46,650 --> 02:10:49,570
But I don't want your BL's above to go.

1684
02:10:50,710 --> 02:10:52,730
Maybe you should tell everyone that.

1685
02:10:55,310 --> 02:11:05,130
okay she's a good kid it's thanks to all of you that she
could grow up to be so kind and carefree hmm but i suppose

1686
02:11:05,130 --> 02:11:13,030
you could say it takes a village huh we don't want to
disturb the community you've built here flea considers all

1687
02:11:13,030 --> 02:11:20,150
of you a part of that community too you know this cruel
world only ever seems to take more and more away from us

1688
02:11:20,150 --> 02:11:21,730
that's why the rare gifts

1689
02:11:25,890 --> 02:11:31,450
I bought the deluxe versions for the chairs.

1690
02:11:35,050 --> 02:11:36,310
I think we've heard enough.

1691
02:11:36,550 --> 02:11:40,070
I got 50 chairs and 50 windows apparently.

1692
02:11:40,790 --> 02:11:44,210
Can I start customizing this goddamn town?

1693
02:11:45,490 --> 02:11:49,190
It seems we have our verdict now.

1694
02:11:51,010 --> 02:11:52,310
Seems like it.

1695
02:11:52,630 --> 02:12:04,210
Who knew hatred for the royal army army ran so deep not deep
enough for 80s apparently when that came out wrong see there

1696
02:12:04,210 --> 02:12:05,810
are others who support your cause

1697
02:12:09,610 --> 02:12:22,550
sounds like we've really got to find that spring now guess
so alright we gotta find water can I talk to you now hey

1698
02:12:22,550 --> 02:12:29,010
Anne you gotta build us the fastest ride ever I'm fine,
thanks for asking.

1699
02:12:30,070 --> 02:12:31,930
Sounds fun, but I need the deets.

1700
02:12:33,670 --> 02:12:37,150
You see, some intense quicksand is blocking our path south
of here.

1701
02:12:38,450 --> 02:12:41,330
We need something that can zip across it before it sinks.

1702
02:12:43,370 --> 02:12:44,890
Well, can't you use your car?

1703
02:12:46,450 --> 02:12:47,350
It's too slow.

1704
02:12:47,670 --> 02:12:50,090
The sand would swallow it up.

1705
02:12:51,290 --> 02:12:52,770
We need something faster!

1706
02:12:55,090 --> 02:12:55,730
Hmm.

1707
02:12:55,750 --> 02:12:59,830
Maybe my bike might work your bike too bad.

1708
02:12:59,910 --> 02:13:00,770
I don't have it.

1709
02:13:00,950 --> 02:13:01,670
Wait what happened to this.

1710
02:13:01,870 --> 02:13:10,070
Oh, yeah, we lost we lost a bike It got wrecked during my
whole high-speed chase with the Royal Army back in Talbot.

1711
02:13:10,590 --> 02:13:20,730
It's a bike faster than water sand Couldn't you fix it if
you had one of those core frame watch it's yeah Sure, but I

1712
02:13:20,730 --> 02:13:22,270
haven't recovered that from the wreck.

1713
02:13:22,670 --> 02:13:32,610
We'll have to go get it then that's what we'll do where is
it yeah where is it i was pretty focused on just getting

1714
02:13:32,610 --> 02:13:45,790
away so i've only got a rough idea i know it should be
somewhere north of talbo at least how specific but i think

1715
02:13:45,790 --> 02:13:57,790
i'll be able to remember more once we get closer good let's
go together sorry i didn't quite catch that what did you say

1716
02:13:57,790 --> 02:14:09,170
we're gonna go together i said let's go together yeah you're
not dead weight so you do that has to be a key for something

1717
02:14:09,170 --> 02:14:14,790
that looks like the most key thing in the world like it has
to be a fucking key

1718
02:14:18,940 --> 02:14:21,700
oh hush let's get going already

What level does this vehicle need?

1728
02:15:09,200 --> 02:15:10,120
Customized vehicle?

1729
02:15:11,300 --> 02:15:11,980

Okay, level up vehicle.

Alright, Dragoon 1.

02:15:27,120 --> 02:15:27,900
You have to be.

1737
02:15:28,280 --> 02:15:30,500

1738
02:15:31,360 --> 02:15:31,900
Okay, parts.

1747
02:15:41,320 --> 02:15:42,600

1755
02:15:50,540 --> 02:15:51,420

1756
02:15:51,600 --> 02:15:52,100
Where the...

1757
02:15:52,100 --> 02:15:53,180

1758
02:15:55,060 --> 02:15:55,720

02:15:55,720 --> 02:15:57,220

1760
02:15:59,680 --> 02:16:01,330

1763
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:09,320
And then...

1764
02:16:09,320 --> 02:16:10,000
Upgrade.

1765
02:16:12,940 --> 02:16:15,020
Yeah, but what is it?

1766
02:16:17,500 --> 02:16:18,480
See you later.

1767
02:16:18,540 --> 02:16:19,820
I think that's all the parts.

1768
02:16:19,940 --> 02:16:20,660
I'm pretty sure.

1769
02:16:20,960 --> 02:16:21,380
Is it?

1770
02:16:21,820 --> 02:16:22,860
Is there anything else?

1771
02:16:23,400 --> 02:16:23,920
Whoa.

1772
02:16:26,120 --> 02:16:27,920
We gotta sell some parts, though.

1773
02:16:28,040 --> 02:16:29,480
We're like...

1774
02:16:30,200 --> 02:16:30,720
Uh...

1775
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:31,980
Yeah, I think that's everything.

1776
02:16:32,660 --> 02:16:32,900
Alright.

1777
02:16:36,640 --> 02:16:37,160
Wee.

1778
02:16:38,560 --> 02:16:39,080
See.

1779
02:16:39,720 --> 02:16:40,740
Is that, like, quest?

1780
02:16:40,840 --> 02:16:42,080
Like, a mini quest right here?

1781
02:16:42,920 --> 02:16:43,960
What is this?

1782
02:16:44,720 --> 02:16:45,200
Hello.

1783
02:16:45,880 --> 02:16:46,400
80s.

1784
02:16:46,420 --> 02:16:47,160
Welcome back.

1785
02:16:47,660 --> 02:16:50,540
That merchant told me he was saved by a demon on his way
here.

1786
02:16:51,400 --> 02:16:52,440
That was you.

1787
02:16:53,260 --> 02:16:54,380
That was me.

1788
02:16:54,680 --> 02:16:55,340
It was.

1789
02:16:55,720 --> 02:16:56,240
Let me thank you too.

1790
02:16:56,500 --> 02:16:58,460
You truly are a lifesaver.

1791
02:16:59,260 --> 02:17:01,480
I don't know what you're talking about.

1792
02:17:02,040 --> 02:17:04,120
A lifesaver that you're gonna ride out.

1793
02:17:04,240 --> 02:17:05,640
Can't you just let her think?

1794
02:17:05,720 --> 02:17:07,240
Yeah, silence you rat.

1795
02:17:08,260 --> 02:17:11,100
Oh, new items?

1796
02:17:11,200 --> 02:17:11,780
Okay, never mind.

1797
02:17:12,060 --> 02:17:14,300
Everything that I said about you, I was just joking.

1798
02:17:16,900 --> 02:17:18,660
I was just joking.

1799
02:17:19,660 --> 02:17:20,080
He-he.

1800
02:17:20,760 --> 02:17:22,020
Adhesive, clay.

1801
02:17:22,320 --> 02:17:23,200
Oh, these are just...

1802
02:17:23,260 --> 02:17:24,360
What about Kroxia?

1803
02:17:25,140 --> 02:17:26,300
You have Kroxia?

1804
02:17:27,160 --> 02:17:28,860
Can I, like, sell my materials?

1805
02:17:29,840 --> 02:17:30,300
Or parts?

1806
02:17:30,380 --> 02:17:31,040
Oh, there we go.

1807
02:17:31,460 --> 02:17:31,460
Okay.

Wait, is there a fast travel for this?

1828
02:20:11,030 --> 02:20:12,750
This has to be a fast travel, right?

1829
02:20:13,010 --> 02:20:13,290
Yeah.

1830
02:20:14,450 --> 02:20:15,790

Now I get to rob them.

1845
02:22:24,400 --> 02:22:25,900
What kind of region are we in?

1846
02:22:27,300 --> 02:22:32,540
Well, there should be a few towns, an army base, and a
bandit hideout around here.

1847
02:22:33,700 --> 02:22:34,940
Oh, there's a radio tower.

1848
02:22:35,260 --> 02:22:36,400
Soldiers and bandits.

1849
02:22:37,340 --> 02:22:38,860
Now he's drifting in heaven.

1850
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:42,380
I interrupted their fucking drift session.

1851
02:22:56,230 --> 02:22:57,090
It's okay.

1852
02:22:57,350 --> 02:22:59,210
That raptor can join another family.

1853
02:22:59,910 --> 02:23:02,290
I was kind of focused on escaping.

1854
02:23:03,690 --> 02:23:05,110
I killed him in the cutscene.

1855
02:23:05,930 --> 02:23:07,750
I know it's around here somewhere.

1856
02:23:11,290 --> 02:23:13,870
Maybe the royals claimed it after they arrested you.

1857
02:23:19,140 --> 02:23:20,680
Look, they're the invasive species.

1858
02:23:21,060 --> 02:23:21,640
These raptors?

1859
02:23:22,060 --> 02:23:23,340
Oh my god!

1860
02:23:24,440 --> 02:23:25,220
He took it!

1861
02:23:25,400 --> 02:23:29,280
Terrano seemed to be carrying something in its mouth.

1862
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:39,840
Speaking of which, heard that terra knows build their nests
out of metal oh they like harvested a bike then maybe one of

1863
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:53,380
them took my bike it's middle gear it's quite possible then
we should go after it it's already out of sight not to worry

1864
02:23:53,380 --> 02:24:04,720
they like to nest on rocky cliffs just like these let's head
after it and see if we can find a way up those cliffs here

1865
02:24:04,720 --> 02:24:11,320
we go is very sensitive to movement and shiny that's okay I
know parkour it only takes the slightest stimulation to draw

1866
02:24:11,320 --> 02:24:19,680
their attention if only it was so easy to get the prince to
pay attention wait what is that supposed to mean I pay

1867
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:25,260
attention okay guys I might need some assistance

1868
02:24:28,380 --> 02:24:33,520
now watch this okay how is I supposed to know I'd be too
short.

1869
02:24:34,160 --> 02:24:35,960
How the fuck was I supposed to know that?

1870
02:24:37,620 --> 02:24:40,440
Terranos are especially ordinary this time of year.

1871
02:24:41,680 --> 02:24:43,180
Whatever you do, don't provoke them.

1872
02:24:43,940 --> 02:24:44,780
I'm gonna provoke them.

1873
02:24:48,300 --> 02:24:49,880
I'm gonna provoke them.

1874
02:24:52,500 --> 02:24:53,700
Watch this.

1875
02:24:55,200 --> 02:24:55,360

1877
02:24:58,620 --> 02:25:00,620

Like Miracat Raptors.

1995
02:35:23,370 --> 02:35:26,990
Knowing what they can do and what their weaknesses are will
help you fight effectively.

1996
02:35:28,770 --> 02:35:29,450
They don't...

1997
02:35:29,450 --> 02:35:32,530
They're all weak to the fucking missiles.

1998
02:35:32,910 --> 02:35:34,050
That's all I need to know.

1999
02:35:34,270 --> 02:35:34,790
Try that.

2000
02:35:34,930 --> 02:35:36,110
Well, so it goes.

2001
02:35:38,350 --> 02:35:39,370
That's all I need.

2002
02:35:39,470 --> 02:35:41,670
I like how the range for this is so low.

2003
02:35:44,370 --> 02:35:47,210
Alright, this has to be the Raptor Stealer, right?

2004
02:35:47,770 --> 02:35:48,810
The Raptor Scale?

2005
02:35:50,850 --> 02:35:52,910
Oh my god, finally.

2006
02:35:55,170 --> 02:35:56,450
Okay, we're going back.

2007
02:35:56,750 --> 02:35:57,550
We did it.

2008
02:35:58,710 --> 02:36:00,490
I got the right family.

2009
02:36:05,710 --> 02:36:07,490
We've harvested the right family.

2010
02:36:12,560 --> 02:36:13,100
Do you need any?

2011
02:36:13,460 --> 02:36:15,460
Yes, please make the vehicle.

2012
02:36:16,580 --> 02:36:18,200
We're going to make your own bike.

2013
02:36:20,980 --> 02:36:22,300

02:36:23,140 --> 02:36:47,580

Junker Market.

02:37:36,060 --> 02:37:37,560
Okay, the junk pit.

2023
02:37:37,620 --> 02:37:38,620
Is it the junk pit?

2024
02:37:41,220 --> 02:37:42,000
Let's see.

2025
02:37:42,080 --> 02:37:43,180
Can I fast travel this?

2026
02:37:46,140 --> 02:37:47,540
I can, thank God.

2027
02:37:47,780 --> 02:37:48,040

All right.

2036
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:07,640
Okay, there's the junk pit.

2037
02:38:08,020 --> 02:38:09,880
Okay, I completed these.

2038
02:38:10,680 --> 02:38:11,120
All right.

2039
02:38:11,340 --> 02:38:14,100
Oh, guys, I just realized there's not a lot.

2040
02:38:14,780 --> 02:38:17,260
I only have one side quest, apparently.

2041
02:38:18,100 --> 02:38:19,440
Wait, where is this one?

2042
02:38:20,160 --> 02:38:21,360
How do I get there?

2043
02:38:23,140 --> 02:38:24,140
How do I get there?

2044
02:38:25,740 --> 02:38:26,800
Oh, it's this way.

2045
02:38:27,920 --> 02:38:28,780
Oh, it's this way.

2046
02:38:29,280 --> 02:38:30,040
It's this way?

2047
02:38:32,460 --> 02:38:33,460
Am I heading the right way?

2048
02:38:33,740 --> 02:38:35,000
No, it's this way.

2049
02:38:35,380 --> 02:38:36,600
Guys, I got lost again.

2050
02:38:37,640 --> 02:38:40,080
Well, I might as well farm these fucking scorpion scales.

2051
02:38:41,920 --> 02:38:46,160
I don't know which one is, like, the quest for crafting.

2052
02:38:47,780 --> 02:38:49,660
What does the crafting quest come?

2053
02:38:49,680 --> 02:39:07,840

jumping when i can't even jump high enough that's actually

2055
02:39:15,280 --> 02:39:20,720

this quest.

2056
02:39:22,520 --> 02:39:26,840
No, I can't fast travel because the animals are angry at me.

2057
02:39:29,980 --> 02:39:31,340
What did I do?

2058
02:39:33,960 --> 02:39:36,060
Rock, paper, scissors, me for it.

2059
02:39:36,220 --> 02:39:39,080
Alright, let me finish this quest first, I guess.

2060
02:39:39,480 --> 02:39:40,540
Rock, paper, scissors.

2061
02:39:41,800 --> 02:39:42,380

2063
02:39:43,220 --> 02:39:44,380
This has to be the quest.

2064

2065
02:39:47,100 --> 02:39:48,460

02:47:28,030 --> 02:47:29,890
Okay, now we go here?

2165
02:47:30,790 --> 02:47:31,030
Yeah.

2166
02:47:32,230 --> 02:47:33,470
Water supply point.

2167
02:47:35,470 --> 02:47:38,190
Uh, now we can, like, ride the water.

2168
02:47:42,910 --> 02:47:43,530
Here we go.

2169
02:47:44,430 --> 02:47:49,050
Alright, autopilot, leave vehicle, boost, shoot, aim,
reload.

2170
02:47:49,290 --> 02:47:50,330
Oh, I have drift!

2171
02:47:51,170 --> 02:47:52,510
I can drift now, too.

2172
02:47:53,050 --> 02:47:53,610
Okay.

2173
02:47:57,070 --> 02:48:09,070

path speed up before we sink into the sand I am speeding I'm

2175
02:48:20,110 --> 02:48:26,890

his car.

2176
02:48:26,890 --> 02:48:29,210
Papa, Beelzebub's here.

2177
02:48:31,890 --> 02:48:32,910
Oh, right.

2178
02:48:33,710 --> 02:48:35,410
Are you ready for action, Gupy?

2179
02:48:36,230 --> 02:48:39,370
We're getting that bounty for sure this time.

2180
02:48:40,350 --> 02:48:41,130
Here goes.

2181
02:48:41,310 --> 02:48:43,890
I feel like Gupy eats all the food for these kids.

2182
02:48:45,890 --> 02:48:49,230
Bro, okay, somebody should, like, take the gun away from
Gupy.

2183
02:48:49,550 --> 02:48:51,130
Oh, he actually hit.

2184
02:48:51,410 --> 02:48:52,150
Did you get him?

2185
02:48:54,430 --> 02:48:57,830
That's like the first time I saw Guppie hit anything.

2186
02:48:58,650 --> 02:49:02,970
Also, he fucking shot my car that I spent so much money on.

2187
02:49:03,450 --> 02:49:04,550
I'm so mad.

2188
02:49:07,010 --> 02:49:09,290
I just made it.

2189
02:49:09,990 --> 02:49:10,630
More or less.

2190
02:49:12,230 --> 02:49:14,250
What the heck just happened?

2191
02:49:16,030 --> 02:49:18,790
Those idiots apparently still haven't learned.

2192
02:49:19,030 --> 02:49:20,570
Yoshi, welcome to the tomato farm.

2193
02:49:20,830 --> 02:49:21,290
Welcome, welcome.

2194
02:49:21,850 --> 02:49:22,590
The feed prince.

2195
02:49:25,670 --> 02:49:26,030
Ow.

2196
02:49:26,370 --> 02:49:29,270
Beelzebub's still alive and kicking!

2197
02:49:30,790 --> 02:49:31,690
Say what?

2198
02:49:33,990 --> 02:49:36,630
Zua, does he look mad?

2199
02:49:38,430 --> 02:49:38,950
Very.

2200
02:49:39,450 --> 02:49:41,430
He's glaring right at us.

2201
02:49:44,390 --> 02:49:48,030
You two, take care of my ride.

2202
02:49:49,810 --> 02:49:50,270
And you?

2203
02:49:51,310 --> 02:49:54,050
I'm gonna beat up some old men.

2204
02:49:56,870 --> 02:49:59,500
Yeah, that's the PG way of saying it.

2205
02:50:02,730 --> 02:50:05,650
Get over here.

2206
02:50:10,570 --> 02:50:12,030
Don't worry.

2207
02:50:13,330 --> 02:50:14,750
Doki mad.

2208
02:50:19,050 --> 02:50:20,130
Here I'll go.

2209
02:50:21,290 --> 02:50:24,550
You're up against the biggest, baddest criminals in
Sandland.

2210
02:50:25,110 --> 02:50:26,350
Here I go.

2211
02:50:26,370 --> 02:50:32,470
Oh, wrong guy Wait, I did that much damage?

2212
02:50:34,170 --> 02:50:34,850
Are you serious?

2213
02:50:36,430 --> 02:50:38,150
I like the damage damage?

2214
02:50:39,570 --> 02:50:40,970
Oh shit, that's fucked up.

2215
02:50:42,190 --> 02:50:43,350
Where is he shooting at?

2216
02:50:43,390 --> 02:50:46,510
Oh my god, okay guys, a guppy needs like help.

2217
02:50:49,090 --> 02:50:51,850
At this point, this might be a guppy issue.

2218
02:50:52,790 --> 02:50:53,390
Like...

2219
02:50:56,370 --> 02:50:56,850
Oh shit!

2220
02:50:57,290 --> 02:50:57,290
Ow.

2221
02:50:58,170 --> 02:50:59,570
Wait, but he does so little damage.

2222
02:50:59,850 --> 02:51:00,650
I'm not scared.

2223
02:51:05,130 --> 02:51:05,450
Whoa!

2224
02:51:06,530 --> 02:51:07,530
Wait, that did nothing.

2225
02:51:08,230 --> 02:51:08,710
Wait, that's funny.

2226
02:51:08,910 --> 02:51:09,510
That actually did nothing.

2227
02:51:12,350 --> 02:51:14,090
Okay, let's get rid of this child first.

2228
02:51:15,070 --> 02:51:16,930
I feel like I should just get rid of Swimmer Papa.

2229
02:51:18,810 --> 02:51:19,130
Okay.

2230
02:51:20,450 --> 02:51:22,050
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2231
02:51:22,530 --> 02:51:23,170
Where are you?

2232
02:51:24,130 --> 02:51:25,470
Don't you dare dodge me.

2233
02:51:26,370 --> 02:51:26,810
That's right.

2234
02:51:29,350 --> 02:51:32,950
I'm going to punch you in the dick because I'm at the
perfect height.

2235
02:51:33,330 --> 02:51:33,750
Oh shit.

2236
02:51:36,210 --> 02:51:41,030
Honestly, I don't think there's like any point in like
beating up the children as well.

2237
02:51:42,590 --> 02:51:43,490
Because like...

2238
02:51:45,530 --> 02:51:46,570
What the...

2239
02:51:46,570 --> 02:51:47,410
Wait, he doesn't...

2240
02:51:47,410 --> 02:51:47,690
What?

2241
02:51:48,650 --> 02:51:50,210
He doesn't even notify me!

2242
02:51:51,050 --> 02:51:51,890
Oh shit.

2243
02:51:53,870 --> 02:51:54,870
Because I just need to kill him.

2244
02:51:57,830 --> 02:51:58,790
It's okay.

2245
02:51:59,190 --> 02:51:59,710
Got it.

2246
02:52:00,130 --> 02:52:00,670
Dodge him.

2247
02:52:00,850 --> 02:52:02,490
Oh, I did not dodge him.

2248
02:52:03,770 --> 02:52:04,310
Okay, nice.

2249
02:52:04,690 --> 02:52:05,290
Keep dodging.

2250
02:52:08,130 --> 02:52:09,390
That's fucking right.

2251
02:52:22,550 --> 02:52:24,610
He just runs.

2252
02:52:25,790 --> 02:52:28,250
Do you believe that sling actually exists?

2253
02:52:28,250 --> 02:52:29,670
Oh, he is pissed.

2254
02:52:31,590 --> 02:52:32,490
Can't see.

2255
02:52:33,930 --> 02:52:35,130
That's for my bike.

2256
02:52:35,370 --> 02:52:36,970
I just spent money on it, too.

2257
02:52:37,010 --> 02:52:39,230
But what I do believe in is the old man.

2258
02:52:41,490 --> 02:52:44,010
If he says there's a spring, I bet he's right.

2259
02:52:44,010 --> 02:52:46,590
I met this guy like a week ago.

2260
02:52:48,630 --> 02:52:54,250
If, and I mean if you fight it, would you maybe let us swim
there too?

2261
02:52:54,370 --> 02:52:56,090
Oh, that's why they're called the swimmer gang.

2262
02:52:56,490 --> 02:52:59,330
I love on the far left you can see the guppy's ass.

2263
02:53:00,170 --> 02:53:01,970
We might call a nice view.

2264
02:53:03,210 --> 02:53:17,370
But my sons never got the chance to kick up somebody noticed
it before I did that's for sure Do what you like Just one

2265
02:53:17,370 --> 02:53:20,350
left Wait, who's the one left?

2266
02:53:20,510 --> 02:53:21,530
Oh, the guy that's running?

2267
02:53:22,650 --> 02:53:24,210
What the fuck

2268
02:53:31,330 --> 02:53:35,570
It's like freaking guys It's anime Sonic now.

2269
02:53:36,810 --> 02:53:38,010
Oh shit.

2270
02:53:39,030 --> 02:53:39,400
Oh no.

2271
02:53:41,270 --> 02:53:42,210
It's okay.

2272
02:53:42,470 --> 02:53:42,910
I'm dodged.

2273
02:53:43,490 --> 02:53:43,990
No way.

2274
02:53:45,230 --> 02:53:46,850
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

2275
02:53:48,570 --> 02:53:50,230
Bro, was there 16?

2276
02:53:51,370 --> 02:53:51,990
Okay, nice.

2277
02:53:52,350 --> 02:53:55,230
Why would that be like the right and not the left?

2278
02:53:56,170 --> 02:53:59,330
Like the way some of this is...

2279
02:53:59,330 --> 02:54:00,970
Sonic 06.

2280
02:54:01,710 --> 02:54:03,130
We caught up to these jerks.

2281
02:54:11,320 --> 02:54:13,260
Why do I even wait you're right.

2282
02:54:13,500 --> 02:54:14,760
Why do I even need a car?

2283
02:54:15,400 --> 02:54:18,580
I'm faster than the car You run all this way.

2284
02:54:18,840 --> 02:54:20,520
I'm nowhere near where I started

2285
02:54:25,940 --> 02:54:28,200
Why does he even need a bike?

2286
02:54:31,540 --> 02:54:39,600
I'm clearly faster than the fucking bike Gains a new power
There's nowhere to hide around here

2287
02:54:43,760 --> 02:54:45,640
Did we just leave that guy to die?

We did it.

2299
02:55:32,300 --> 02:55:32,800
Phew.

2300
02:55:34,300 --> 02:55:35,520
That was close.

2301
02:55:39,890 --> 02:55:41,910
Why is there light from deeper in?

2302
02:55:42,550 --> 02:55:42,990
Yeah.

2303
02:55:43,230 --> 02:55:44,570
Is there a secret town in there?

2304
02:55:45,010 --> 02:55:45,490
Secret?

02:55:45,690 --> 02:55:47,050

That's the spring!

2309
02:55:55,690 --> 02:55:57,590
Oh my god, there's trees!

2310
02:56:00,890 --> 02:56:01,970
There's a turtle.

2311
02:56:02,910 --> 02:56:04,130
How did he get up there?

2312
02:56:04,270 --> 02:56:05,970
How did that turtle get up there?

2313
02:56:09,530 --> 02:56:13,850
I can't wait to tell the whole world about this one tiny ass
lake.

2314
02:56:19,880 --> 02:56:21,540
Yes, there we go.

2315
02:56:23,760 --> 02:56:26,400
I wonder just how far the prince got off to.

2316
02:56:28,180 --> 02:56:30,960
We should have made him take a walkie-talkie with him.

2317
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:33,500
Man.

2318
02:56:37,020 --> 02:56:37,420
Man.

2319
02:56:38,620 --> 02:56:40,460
No, that wasn't me.

2320
02:56:41,220 --> 02:56:42,580
That was...

2321
02:56:43,500 --> 02:56:45,400
Hey, old man.

2322
02:56:47,540 --> 02:56:49,860
Prince, where are you shouting from?

2323
02:56:52,340 --> 02:56:55,340
Hello, did you forget about my telepathy?

2324
02:56:56,760 --> 02:56:59,140
Anyway, enough about that.

2325
02:56:59,780 --> 02:57:01,200
Guess where I am right now.

2326
02:57:01,280 --> 02:57:02,040
Where are you at?

2327
02:57:02,940 --> 02:57:03,620
I don't know.

2328
02:57:03,980 --> 02:57:03,980
Where?

2329
02:57:06,740 --> 02:57:07,640
The spring.

2330
02:57:08,680 --> 02:57:10,520
I found your legendary spring.

2331
02:57:12,340 --> 02:57:13,320
We did it.

2332
02:57:13,700 --> 02:57:14,340
Can it be?

2333
02:57:14,740 --> 02:57:16,480
You really made it to the spring?

2334
02:57:17,020 --> 02:57:17,500
Yeah.

2335
02:57:18,320 --> 02:57:18,760
What?

2336
02:57:18,900 --> 02:57:22,060
You telling me the word of a fiend He's not good enough for
you.

2337
02:57:23,580 --> 02:57:24,100
Sorry.

2338
02:57:24,680 --> 02:57:25,980
So, where is it?

2339
02:57:27,080 --> 02:57:29,360
It's like inside a rock.

2340
02:57:31,760 --> 02:57:32,900
In your mom's house.

2341
02:57:36,400 --> 02:57:37,140
This is Aare.

2342
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:39,300
May I have a moment, sire.

2343
02:57:41,600 --> 02:57:43,580
What is it, General Aare?

2344
02:57:44,120 --> 02:57:46,680
I'm in the middle of a meal right now, you know.

2345
02:57:46,800 --> 02:57:47,020
Whoa.

2346
02:57:47,240 --> 02:57:48,560
Wait, he gets second dinner?

2347
02:57:48,560 --> 02:57:50,920
You hardly ever contact me to...

2348
02:57:50,920 --> 02:57:51,220
Oh!

2349
02:57:51,700 --> 02:57:54,120
Don't tell me you've gotten rid of Shiva already!

2350
02:57:55,400 --> 02:57:56,520
My apologies, Sire.

2351
02:57:57,280 --> 02:57:57,660
You see.

2352
02:57:59,940 --> 02:58:02,540
Supreme Commander Zayu just told me something.

2353
02:58:04,140 --> 02:58:09,320
He said you had personally ordered him to carry out the
genocide of the Peachy and the destruction of the Tank

2354
02:58:09,320 --> 02:58:10,680
Brigade 30 years ago.

2355
02:58:12,760 --> 02:58:13,820
He... he what?

2356
02:58:14,040 --> 02:58:17,940
Why would he tell people that explosion was deliberate now
of all times?

2357
02:58:19,340 --> 02:58:21,680
Anyway, that is a bold-faced lie.

2358
02:58:22,620 --> 02:58:25,780
Zayu came up with that entire plan all in his own.

2359
02:58:26,320 --> 02:58:29,240
Oh my god, he already threw him under the rock.

2360
02:58:29,440 --> 02:58:29,680
I see.

2361
02:58:32,800 --> 02:58:35,700
Yes, I am still pursuing Shiva, Sire.

2362
02:58:36,380 --> 02:58:36,900
All right, out.

2363
02:58:37,520 --> 02:58:39,000
He's getting bamboozled.

2364
02:58:39,120 --> 02:58:40,460
He's shifting the blame.

2365
02:58:41,780 --> 02:58:43,100
I can't believe it.

2366
02:58:43,440 --> 02:58:43,980
It's true.

2367
02:58:44,540 --> 02:58:45,240
All of it.

2368
02:58:47,160 --> 02:58:48,540
Put me through the general.

2369
02:58:48,560 --> 02:58:49,500
Shiva now.

2370
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:55,720
I can't believe it was true this entire time.

2371
02:58:56,260 --> 02:58:57,600
Inside this rock formation?

2372
02:59:04,990 --> 02:59:05,550
Incredible.

2373
02:59:07,150 --> 02:59:10,430
I'm just wondering, has he ever even seen a tree in grass
before?

2374
02:59:10,830 --> 02:59:12,850
I can't believe it.

2375
02:59:12,870 --> 02:59:14,090
Like, in his lifetime?

2376
02:59:16,810 --> 02:59:17,790
I know, right?

2377
02:59:18,050 --> 02:59:19,050
Aren't you impressed?

2378
02:59:20,230 --> 02:59:22,870
Okay, let's split up and look around.

2379
02:59:23,510 --> 02:59:24,410
Look around for what?

2380
02:59:24,410 --> 02:59:37,830

2383
02:59:56,930 --> 02:59:58,870
Don't bathe in the water.

2384
02:59:59,390 --> 03:00:01,270
Just remember when you drink that water.

2385
03:00:01,510 --> 03:00:03,210
Oh, it's the fucking...

2386
03:00:03,210 --> 03:00:04,050

03:00:04,830 --> 03:00:06,130
It's the Toriyama houses!

2388
03:00:07,210 --> 03:00:08,630
What the fuck is a monkey?

2389
03:00:11,490 --> 03:00:13,970
Just remember when you drink that water.

2390
03:00:14,170 --> 03:00:14,770
Remember it.

2391
03:00:19,410 --> 03:00:21,710
Remember who touched it.

03:00:28,180 --> 03:00:36,600

like the ear in a thousand plus years, their ears are going

2403
03:02:03,450 --> 03:02:05,390
to fall off and they're going to be tiny.

2404
03:02:06,530 --> 03:02:08,530
I was searching for the spring.

2405
03:02:10,890 --> 03:02:12,970
A demon by yourself?

2406
03:02:16,020 --> 03:02:17,820
No, I came with my friends.

2407
03:02:18,480 --> 03:02:19,140
Thief and Rao.

2408
03:02:24,470 --> 03:02:29,890
Rao, if what we heard on the radio is correct, isn't that
the name General Shiva goes by now?

2409
03:02:30,730 --> 03:02:31,130
Yeah.

2410
03:02:34,140 --> 03:02:37,500
Then you're saying Shiva's at our doorstep.

2411
03:02:37,520 --> 03:02:40,200
Wait, he's the war criminal.

2412
03:02:40,580 --> 03:02:41,800
They killed their family.

2413
03:02:42,900 --> 03:02:46,200
I mean, he still committed it.

2414
03:02:46,680 --> 03:02:49,460
Like, that's not going to exempt him.

2415
03:02:50,040 --> 03:02:54,980
He killed maybe millions of people or aliens.

2416
03:02:58,320 --> 03:03:02,800
It sounds like he has had much on his conscience these many
years.

2417
03:03:04,200 --> 03:03:07,300
When you go back, tell him the past is forgiven.

2418
03:03:07,520 --> 03:03:09,540
He did the crime, but not the time.

2419
03:03:11,460 --> 03:03:13,120
And I have a request.

2420
03:03:14,500 --> 03:03:18,080
Oh, that's not what, how you, that's how you, like, forgive
it in War Criminal.

2421
03:03:18,260 --> 03:03:20,180
All they have to say is, like, I'm sorry.

2422
03:03:22,360 --> 03:03:23,900
You have my gratitude.

2423
03:03:26,580 --> 03:03:28,320
Need anything from the outside world?

2424
03:03:28,820 --> 03:03:30,980
Bet Rao'd be happy to bring it by later.

2425
03:03:32,700 --> 03:03:34,440
Oh, that would help immensely.

2426
03:03:34,840 --> 03:03:37,500
I mean, Vegeta got, oh, yeah, because he was hot.

2427
03:03:37,520 --> 03:03:43,060
There's many canned goods, articles of clothing, and shoes
as you can get your hands on.

2428
03:03:44,700 --> 03:03:45,500
You got it.

2429
03:03:48,880 --> 03:03:51,460
He had abs, too.

2430
03:03:54,520 --> 03:03:57,560
Hot people can get away with a lot of things.

2431
03:03:57,720 --> 03:03:58,520
I'm just...

2432
03:04:01,040 --> 03:04:03,120
Like he had murderers.

2433
03:04:06,120 --> 03:04:07,120
Okay, wait.

2434
03:04:07,520 --> 03:04:21,480
rob them they have stuff i can steal from them poros can't
believe foreigners have made their way wait i wouldn't they

2435
03:04:21,480 --> 03:04:35,300
be the foreigners because they're literally aliens like i
don't why did he call me the foreigner hello hello they're

2436
03:04:35,300 --> 03:04:36,980
literally the aliens

2437
03:04:40,660 --> 03:04:42,500
They're in a peachy race.

2438
03:04:43,340 --> 03:04:45,260
Now they own this now.

2439
03:04:45,420 --> 03:04:46,160
They aren't aliens.

2440
03:04:46,280 --> 03:04:48,260
I thought the peachy race were the aliens.

2441
03:04:50,040 --> 03:04:51,800
Like this is my home first.

2442
03:04:56,210 --> 03:04:57,270
Let's see this way.

2443
03:04:59,790 --> 03:05:01,210
Oh there's a chest here.

2444
03:05:03,150 --> 03:05:03,550
Yay.

2445
03:05:05,750 --> 03:05:07,410
They're second generation.

2446
03:05:10,870 --> 03:05:14,330
Okay, that was, that, that was good.

2447
03:05:18,230 --> 03:05:20,370
Rob, thank you for the super chat.

2448
03:05:20,690 --> 03:05:21,530
Thank you, thank you.

2449
03:05:21,850 --> 03:05:26,050
Remember, Doki, whenever you do war crimes, oddities, give
them a puppy face and say, I'm sorry.

2450
03:05:26,630 --> 03:05:27,370
Thank you, super chat.

2451
03:05:27,510 --> 03:05:27,770
Thank you.

2452
03:05:27,910 --> 03:05:28,130
Thank you.

2453
03:05:28,130 --> 03:05:28,390
Thank you.

2454
03:05:32,820 --> 03:05:35,900
Yeah, some peachy survivors and their kids.

2455
03:05:37,040 --> 03:05:39,600
I told them the truth about what happened 30 years ago.

2456
03:05:41,400 --> 03:05:45,720
from they are they literally came from under earth that's
practically earth

2457
03:05:49,980 --> 03:06:00,780
weren't wiped out after all forgive me prince I have no
right to ask this of you but could we just leave this look

2458
03:06:00,780 --> 03:06:07,780
some of these peaches were born on this earth now so they're
like second-generation peaches here so he's technically from

2459
03:06:07,780 --> 03:06:13,760
earth now I already told the peachy That we'd forget we ever
saw this place.

2460
03:06:14,460 --> 03:06:15,900
I should have known you'd say that.

2461
03:06:16,740 --> 03:06:17,880
Out of everyone I've met.

2462
03:06:19,060 --> 03:06:21,880
I've never known anyone with a soul as pure as you are.

2463
03:06:21,880 --> 03:06:23,420
Oh my god, for a demon?

2464
03:06:23,760 --> 03:06:25,500
Is there any way to compliment a fiend?

2465
03:06:26,540 --> 03:06:26,920
Oh right.

2466
03:06:27,380 --> 03:06:28,820
I asked if they wanted anything.

2467
03:06:29,740 --> 03:06:32,360
And they said canned food, clothes, and shoes.

2468
03:06:33,320 --> 03:06:34,180
What are they...

2469
03:06:34,180 --> 03:06:34,940
Of course.

2470
03:06:35,080 --> 03:06:36,960
Shoes, clothes and shoes for it.

2471
03:06:37,080 --> 03:06:41,380
Once this is all over, I'll load up a truck with anything I
can get and deliver them here.

2472
03:06:45,170 --> 03:06:48,530
I can't believe we'll say that to the demon prince.

2473
03:06:50,810 --> 03:06:52,770
So, what do we do now?

2474
03:06:54,150 --> 03:06:56,030
We have to find the king's water source.

2475
03:06:56,790 --> 03:06:58,210
There's something fishy about it.

2476
03:06:58,370 --> 03:06:59,350
I just know it.

2477
03:07:00,910 --> 03:07:02,730
Yeah, it's not gonna be easy.

2478
03:07:03,390 --> 03:07:04,810
You don't even know where it is.

2479
03:07:05,430 --> 03:07:07,130
And it's definitely gonna be well protected.

2480
03:07:09,450 --> 03:07:11,010
Yeah, what do you need shoes for?

2481
03:07:12,410 --> 03:07:12,850
Yeah.

2482
03:07:12,870 --> 03:07:13,910
The radio?

2483
03:07:14,590 --> 03:07:15,650
Who in the world?

2484
03:07:17,910 --> 03:07:20,210
Hey, flip that switch to put it on speaker.

2485
03:07:23,510 --> 03:07:25,030
This is General Rory.

2486
03:07:26,190 --> 03:07:29,690
I'm just talking to myself, all right?

2487
03:07:32,450 --> 03:07:35,370
It sure would put us in a tough spot.

2488
03:07:37,290 --> 03:07:41,870
If anyone were to follow the dried-up riverbed all the way
to its southern end...

2489
03:07:42,870 --> 03:08:09,610
be pretty bad oh no so terrible but no one's gonna do that
right yeah but no criminals are gonna be listening to this

2490
03:08:09,610 --> 03:08:20,470
radio right use a break myself after from the king at the
events of 30 years ago transpired exactly as thief said they

2491
03:08:20,470 --> 03:08:33,170

feeling in the mood to talk to myself as well there are

hope for Sandlands future Wait, what in, like, the other...

Oh, my gosh.

2497
03:08:51,390 --> 03:08:53,750
Okay, don't think about the plot holes too hard, Doki.

2498
03:08:54,330 --> 03:08:55,570
Don't think about it.

2499
03:08:56,530 --> 03:09:02,230
He's well aware that Zayu will discover what he's done
before long and that he will be punished for it.

2500
03:09:03,290 --> 03:09:04,770
But then why did he tell us?

2501
03:09:05,110 --> 03:09:06,710
What does he stand to gain?

2502
03:09:08,070 --> 03:09:09,450
Perhaps it's in his blood.

2503
03:09:09,470 --> 03:09:21,850
China scorpion father was a great man too after all it just
works oh it's a queen wait he disappeared oh why is she so

2504
03:09:21,850 --> 03:09:40,150
mad I don't understand what could she be mad about I don't
understand what did I do what could I possibly done.

2505
03:09:41,530 --> 03:09:42,150
Okay, we gotta reload.

2506
03:09:43,210 --> 03:09:44,230
I know!

2507
03:09:44,750 --> 03:09:45,190
I know!

2508
03:09:46,070 --> 03:09:49,050
Okay, but look at how tough the exoskeleton is.

2509
03:09:49,550 --> 03:09:53,090
My fucking missiles is like a little like love bump, you
know?

2510
03:09:53,950 --> 03:09:56,390
It's like a little tap.

2511
03:09:57,530 --> 03:09:59,970
Okay, what the fuck is this raptor want to do?

2512
03:10:01,530 --> 03:10:03,370
Get out of the fight!

2513
03:10:03,890 --> 03:10:05,530
This doesn't concern you!

2514
03:10:07,470 --> 03:10:08,070
You!

2515
03:10:09,470 --> 03:10:10,510
What are you doing?

2516
03:10:11,390 --> 03:10:12,070
There we go.

2517
03:10:12,570 --> 03:10:12,570
Nice.

2518
03:10:13,250 --> 03:10:14,210
Oh my god.

2519
03:10:14,490 --> 03:10:15,050
Get out.

2520
03:10:16,550 --> 03:10:17,070
Nice.

2521
03:10:17,310 --> 03:10:19,330
I got Creek Queen Exoskeleton.

2522
03:10:20,710 --> 03:10:22,310
Uh, we gotta go here.

2523
03:10:23,070 --> 03:10:24,790
Real secrets no more.

2524
03:10:25,930 --> 03:10:26,970
Uh, alright.

2525
03:10:27,050 --> 03:10:28,090
We gotta fast try out Spino.

2526
03:10:29,270 --> 03:10:31,630
He's in the splash zone.

2527
03:10:32,270 --> 03:10:33,270
Wait, why is there?

2528
03:10:33,450 --> 03:10:34,850
Oh yeah, it's just a cat.

2529
03:10:36,130 --> 03:10:37,550
Uh, we gotta go this way.

2530
03:10:41,360 --> 03:10:45,040
Guys, how many percentage of the game have I done anyway?

2531
03:10:45,400 --> 03:10:47,180
I feel like not that much.

2532
03:10:48,540 --> 03:10:49,740
All right.

2533
03:10:50,760 --> 03:10:53,600
Like, how much percentage of the story am I in?

2534
03:10:53,980 --> 03:10:54,780
You got it.

2535
03:10:59,840 --> 03:11:00,700
20%?

2536
03:11:02,020 --> 03:11:03,520
This is 20%?

2537
03:11:03,780 --> 03:11:05,540
Chapter 13 out of 30?

2538
03:11:05,760 --> 03:11:06,080
Whoa.

2539
03:11:09,880 --> 03:11:12,180
Bro, this already feels like like mid-game.

2540
03:11:12,660 --> 03:11:19,680
I feel like I thought I was like um, I thought I was like at
mid-game with the way the story was going.

2541
03:11:20,540 --> 03:11:22,140
Apparently I wasn't even mid-game.

2542
03:11:22,320 --> 03:11:24,020
I'm chapter 13 of 31.

2543
03:11:26,400 --> 03:11:30,600
They roam over Sandland, peddling their wares to all comers.

2544
03:11:31,360 --> 03:11:32,480
Okay, I might need more Raptors.

2545
03:11:33,860 --> 03:11:36,720
If we find any, let's stop and compare notes with them.

2546
03:11:39,100 --> 03:11:40,960

We might be able to reach these inaccessible spots one day.

2562
03:14:26,390 --> 03:14:28,830
Supreme Commander Zayu, we have General Aure on the line.

2563
03:14:31,510 --> 03:14:31,510
Hello.

2564
03:14:31,930 --> 03:14:32,890
It's me.

2565
03:14:33,510 --> 03:14:34,150
Give me that.

2566
03:14:34,570 --> 03:14:35,670
Can you hear me, Aure?

2567
03:14:37,230 --> 03:14:40,450
What kind of lies have you been telling to the king?

2568
03:14:40,470 --> 03:14:41,270
The truth!

2569
03:14:45,490 --> 03:14:47,770
Wait, has he not listened to the radio?

2570
03:14:49,190 --> 03:14:53,090
some confirmation that you haven't completely lost your
mind.

2571
03:14:55,710 --> 03:14:56,330
Hello?

2572
03:14:57,130 --> 03:14:59,490
Sorry, it seems reception's bad here.

2573
03:15:01,170 --> 03:15:02,670
Can't hear what you're saying.

2574
03:15:03,790 --> 03:15:03,870
Oh.

2575
03:15:05,450 --> 03:15:09,870
No response from the troops guarding the water source or
general R.A.

2576
03:15:11,350 --> 03:15:11,550
What?

2577
03:15:14,950 --> 03:15:17,790
Dispatch my personal elite guard to the water source.

2578
03:15:17,850 --> 03:15:20,650
I thought someone was like, that That dude's in an iron
loathe.

2579
03:15:21,010 --> 03:15:22,370
Ha ha ha ha.

2580
03:15:23,970 --> 03:15:32,490
According to information from the news office, a criminal
organization attempted to go after the bounty on Shiva's

2581
03:15:32,490 --> 03:15:33,290
head yesterday.

2582
03:15:35,090 --> 03:15:36,770
We're instead defeated.

2583
03:15:38,150 --> 03:15:39,410
He's that strong.

2584
03:15:39,790 --> 03:15:43,570
With the help of a young but incredibly powerful red demon.

2585
03:15:45,330 --> 03:15:48,910
A young, red demon?

2586
03:15:50,270 --> 03:15:51,070
That's...

2587
03:15:51,070 --> 03:15:51,470
Beelzebub!

2588
03:15:52,510 --> 03:15:53,230
Ashmir!

2589
03:15:54,890 --> 03:15:55,690
Beelzebub!

2590
03:15:56,070 --> 03:15:56,870
Sayhu!

2591
03:15:57,110 --> 03:15:59,550
Why is Shiva fighting alongside the feet?

2592
03:15:59,550 --> 03:16:01,590
He was pink, not red!

2593
03:16:03,730 --> 03:16:05,590
I can't believe it!

2594
03:16:07,430 --> 03:16:08,790
They miscolored him!

2595
03:16:09,070 --> 03:16:10,270
How dare he!

2596
03:16:11,150 --> 03:16:13,350
Can you hear me, Dr. Posey?

2597
03:16:14,030 --> 03:16:17,090
Prepare the insect men for combat right away!

2598
03:16:17,210 --> 03:16:18,550
The insect men?

2599
03:16:19,470 --> 03:16:22,690
And deploy our secret weapon as well.

2600
03:16:24,430 --> 03:16:26,490
The insect men, that's too dangerous.

2601
03:16:26,730 --> 03:16:27,670
They're not yet complete.

2602
03:16:28,710 --> 03:16:29,970
I don't care.

2603
03:16:30,310 --> 03:16:33,990
As long as they can kill Siba and that demon, they're ready
enough.

2604
03:16:34,490 --> 03:16:35,610
I like his pink glasses.

2605
03:16:38,350 --> 03:16:39,810
As you wish.

2606
03:16:39,950 --> 03:16:41,550
Oh my god, it ain't gonna look like Cybermen.

2607
03:16:46,260 --> 03:16:47,740
Okay, how far is this?

2608
03:16:47,860 --> 03:16:49,920
Holy shit, that's far.

2609
03:16:50,620 --> 03:16:51,120
Wow.

2610
03:16:53,800 --> 03:16:55,220
Oh my god.

2611
03:16:57,860 --> 03:16:59,280
I wonder what they're going to look like.

2612
03:16:59,920 --> 03:17:01,400
I wonder what they're going to look like the Cybermen.

2613
03:17:04,340 --> 03:17:08,580
I thought Array said he gave all his soldiers an impromptu
holiday.

2614
03:17:09,520 --> 03:17:09,780
Whoa!

2615
03:17:10,040 --> 03:17:11,880
They're tough.

2616
03:17:12,260 --> 03:17:13,260
Stay on your toes.

2617
03:17:14,820 --> 03:17:15,260
It's okay.

2618
03:17:15,680 --> 03:17:16,800
I'm just going to...

2619
03:17:17,840 --> 03:17:19,360
Honestly, I'm just going to skip all this.

2620
03:17:22,520 --> 03:17:24,360
Dude, that's way too many people.

2621
03:17:24,720 --> 03:17:25,620
I just shoot the men.

2622
03:17:29,040 --> 03:17:29,520
Oh, shit.

2623
03:17:29,660 --> 03:17:30,100
I think I reload.

2624
03:17:32,940 --> 03:17:34,220
Oh, don't shoot and drive.

2625
03:17:35,280 --> 03:17:36,260
Don't shoot and drive.

2626
03:17:36,540 --> 03:17:39,100
They always say don't drink and drive, but never don't shoot
and drive.

2627
03:17:39,540 --> 03:17:39,640
Oh.

2628
03:17:41,560 --> 03:17:43,340
Alright, I can outrun this.

2629
03:17:43,840 --> 03:17:44,940
Oh, you're right.

2630
03:17:45,040 --> 03:17:45,980
Okay, you're right, guys.

2631
03:17:46,080 --> 03:17:48,580
You, like, convinced me by saying loot.

2632
03:17:49,260 --> 03:17:50,260
Alright, I'm turning back.

2633
03:17:53,260 --> 03:17:54,060
You're right.

2634
03:17:54,560 --> 03:17:55,720
You guys always know.

2635
03:17:56,560 --> 03:17:58,440
You know I can't resist loot, guys.

2636
03:17:58,600 --> 03:17:59,040
You knew.

2637
03:18:00,360 --> 03:18:01,880
I might as well.

2638
03:18:03,420 --> 03:18:03,740
Phew.

2639
03:18:06,520 --> 03:18:07,920
Get over here.

2640
03:18:08,480 --> 03:18:09,000
Pupupupupup.

2641
03:18:12,040 --> 03:18:12,800
Get over here.

2642
03:18:12,880 --> 03:18:13,640
I'm going to run you over.

2643
03:18:15,900 --> 03:18:17,880
Okay, we got to get rid of him and him too.

2644
03:18:18,980 --> 03:18:19,520
Alright, nice.

2645
03:18:20,220 --> 03:18:21,180
That should be enough loot.

2646
03:18:23,480 --> 03:18:24,560
No survivors.

2647
03:18:25,120 --> 03:18:27,500
The moment I hear Luke, they're all dead.

2648
03:18:32,500 --> 03:18:33,100
It's time.

2649
03:18:35,880 --> 03:18:39,060
Oh my god, these guys interrupted my plot.

2650
03:18:39,240 --> 03:18:39,900
My lore.

2651
03:18:40,180 --> 03:18:41,220
How dare they?

2652
03:18:42,560 --> 03:18:43,660
That's so fucked up.

2653
03:18:44,160 --> 03:18:45,780
We gotta get rid of these little guys, though.

2654
03:18:48,380 --> 03:18:48,920
And...

2655
03:18:48,920 --> 03:18:49,500
Okay.

2656
03:18:51,760 --> 03:18:52,420
They're almost dead.

2657
03:18:54,000 --> 03:19:03,740
come on dragons you guys can do better than that you used to
one-shot people this is why you're not better dragons okay

2658
03:19:03,740 --> 03:19:20,340
just like one tank that's living all right nice and boom oh
nice we leveled up we did it and then bike time

2659
03:19:24,280 --> 03:19:24,680
Wow.

2660
03:19:27,520 --> 03:19:28,760
We didn't see that.

2661
03:19:31,120 --> 03:19:31,380
All right.

2662
03:19:31,860 --> 03:19:32,700
I wonder how fast we can go.

2663
03:19:32,860 --> 03:19:33,700
We can only go like 98.

2664
03:19:34,460 --> 03:19:35,780
Oh, if we go straight.

2665
03:19:37,300 --> 03:19:38,740
If we go straight, it goes up, right?

2666
03:19:39,840 --> 03:19:40,960
What if I can upgrade?

2667
03:19:41,140 --> 03:19:41,920
Do I have enough now?

2668
03:19:42,780 --> 03:19:43,860
No, I just need one more.

2669
03:19:43,980 --> 03:19:46,080
What would you do if you ran into a tough enemy?

2670
03:19:47,380 --> 03:19:48,180
Let's see.

2671
03:19:48,780 --> 03:19:51,420
Well, I'd start by observing them carefully.

2672
03:19:53,280 --> 03:20:01,320

03:20:57,030 --> 03:20:57,890
Why is this this way?

2681
03:21:02,750 --> 03:21:11,050
all right and then we go this way drift my god it takes so
long the turn

2682
03:21:14,410 --> 03:21:23,730
what the fuck how did they get over here looks like there's
something they really don't want us to see yeah what is the

2683
03:21:23,730 --> 03:21:28,590
twist there has to be a twist here well obviously there is a
twist because

2684
03:21:35,560 --> 03:21:36,240
No.

2685
03:21:36,880 --> 03:21:37,680
No, there's like one!

2686
03:21:40,340 --> 03:21:40,680
Nice.

2687
03:21:41,940 --> 03:21:43,760
And then absorb.

2688
03:21:49,540 --> 03:21:49,820
Okay.

2689
03:21:54,020 --> 03:21:54,440
Oh no.

2690
03:21:54,580 --> 03:21:56,280
I have to walk now.

2691
03:21:56,980 --> 03:21:58,200
My legs.

2692
03:21:58,460 --> 03:22:01,140
I have to use my legs.

2693
03:22:03,060 --> 03:22:03,740
Alright.

2694
03:22:04,080 --> 03:22:05,560
Time to use my legs.

2695
03:22:08,260 --> 03:22:10,540
Yeah, but there's a deep, dark secret.

2696
03:22:10,760 --> 03:22:12,300
What could that be, though?

2697
03:22:16,000 --> 03:22:17,580
Over where exactly?

2698
03:22:17,920 --> 03:22:18,820
Yeah, where do we go?

2699
03:22:20,800 --> 03:22:21,500
I'm here.

2700
03:22:22,760 --> 03:22:24,200
Let me drink some water.

2701
03:22:24,900 --> 03:22:25,780
Gotta stay hydrated.

2702
03:22:34,380 --> 03:22:35,400
Look there.

2703
03:22:35,860 --> 03:22:36,700
Yeah, there it is.

2704
03:22:37,880 --> 03:22:38,200
What?

2705
03:22:40,860 --> 03:22:42,260
What the fuck?

2706
03:22:42,560 --> 03:22:44,020
I don't believe it.

2707
03:22:44,480 --> 03:22:57,020
They damned up the whole river Wait, so there's water this
entire time Then the river didn't dry up on its own Wait, is

2708
03:22:57,020 --> 03:22:57,280
it?

2709
03:22:57,920 --> 03:23:00,560
Are we like the only country with no water?

2710
03:23:01,500 --> 03:23:03,480
That's so fucked up!

2711
03:23:03,920 --> 03:23:06,560
Like, the rest of the world's okay!

2712
03:23:07,580 --> 03:23:09,240
It's just this area!

2713
03:23:09,880 --> 03:23:10,540

no planes So they can't fly over And see it It was literally

We know all lands are sand?

2721
03:24:20,210 --> 03:24:20,890
They...

2722
03:24:20,890 --> 03:24:23,330
They actually created it?

2723
03:24:23,710 --> 03:24:25,090
Wait, what's this?

2724
03:24:27,030 --> 03:24:28,390

2725
03:24:28,390 --> 03:24:29,670
Yeah, Waterland.

2726
03:24:31,050 --> 03:24:34,030
That was the Sandland stays in Sandland.

2727
03:24:35,410 --> 03:24:38,270
Not a loss for words now, are you?

2728
03:24:40,270 --> 03:24:41,730
Just wait right there.

2729
03:24:42,170 --> 03:24:44,350
But Sandland, not Sand World.

2730
03:24:44,790 --> 03:24:47,070
I promise you that I will make it quick.

2731

those pesky rats refuse to die

2735
03:25:25,140 --> 03:25:27,280
Dr. Pussy?

2736
03:25:29,220 --> 03:25:31,540
Are you really sure about this?

2737
03:25:32,560 --> 03:25:35,900
We still haven't been able to achieve complete control over
them.

2738
03:25:37,240 --> 03:25:40,260
Once they defeat the enemy, they may turn on nearby
civilians.

2739
03:25:40,720 --> 03:25:41,920
Oh, for that matter, us.

2740
03:25:43,980 --> 03:25:45,020
Sorry, it's Pussy.

2741
03:25:48,320 --> 03:25:49,980
Sorry, it's French.

2742
03:25:53,780 --> 03:25:54,800
What's that

2743
03:26:02,890 --> 03:26:04,130
round thing?

2744
03:26:05,230 --> 03:26:05,750
Can it be?

2745
03:26:08,710 --> 03:26:09,930
Get it right, Doki.

2746
03:26:10,150 --> 03:26:10,730
It's French.

2747
03:26:11,190 --> 03:26:13,530
Oh my god, it hovers?

2748
03:26:14,070 --> 03:26:14,910
I'm surprised.

2749
03:26:15,090 --> 03:26:16,770
It is like the Frieza thing.

2750
03:26:18,550 --> 03:26:20,470
I could say the same to you.

2751
03:26:22,070 --> 03:26:25,910
Then again, you're too power hungry to let even death get in
your way.

2752
03:26:28,610 --> 03:26:31,850
Why do you always have to go and cause such...

2753
03:26:31,870 --> 03:26:45,150
trouble Shiva why can't you leave things in peace peace
make-a-wish freezer is this tyranny what you call peace I

2754
03:26:45,150 --> 03:26:53,430
know everything say you I hope you're prepared for the
consequences you should be prepared for the consequences of

2755
03:26:53,430 --> 03:27:00,930
crossing me you have no idea who you're dealing with dr.
Posey now

2756
03:27:05,300 --> 03:27:06,220
What's he gonna do now?

2757
03:27:06,380 --> 03:27:07,420
Oh, it's the InSigman!

2758
03:27:09,100 --> 03:27:10,520
Freeza from Team U.

2759
03:27:13,240 --> 03:27:14,800
What did it look like?

2760
03:27:15,240 --> 03:27:15,840
What's that?

2761
03:27:16,920 --> 03:27:18,580
Prince, that pod.

2762
03:27:19,180 --> 03:27:21,000
I don't like the look of it.

2763
03:27:22,280 --> 03:27:23,640
Yeah, I know.

2764
03:27:24,320 --> 03:27:25,700
There's a nasty smell.

2765
03:27:25,700 --> 03:27:26,280
Okay, it's not their fault.

2766
03:27:26,520 --> 03:27:27,560
There's no showers in there.

2767
03:27:27,620 --> 03:27:29,040
Look how tiny the pods are.

2768
03:27:29,660 --> 03:27:30,760
It's not their fault.

2769
03:27:33,060 --> 03:27:33,580
Ugh.

2770
03:27:37,240 --> 03:27:39,600
Oh my god, this looks like a Cyberman.

2771
03:27:42,780 --> 03:27:43,660
Oh, never mind.

2772
03:27:43,800 --> 03:27:44,720
It does not look like that.

2773
03:27:47,700 --> 03:27:48,660
Never mind.

2774
03:27:48,880 --> 03:27:50,240
It was just the arms.

2775
03:27:56,850 --> 03:27:57,330
Growling.

2776
03:27:59,430 --> 03:28:00,830
It's just a bug.

2777
03:28:06,010 --> 03:28:07,850
This is our ultimate.

2778
03:28:11,610 --> 03:28:13,130
One person?

2779
03:28:14,410 --> 03:28:15,410
Oh, demons!

2780
03:28:17,350 --> 03:28:24,230
How can the bugs kill demons?

2781
03:28:25,010 --> 03:28:25,830
Oh, dang.

2782
03:28:26,590 --> 03:28:29,890
I'll admit, that thing does look dangerous.

2783
03:28:30,410 --> 03:28:30,770
Old time.

2784
03:28:31,450 --> 03:28:33,930
Incent men actually looking like an insect?

2785
03:28:34,290 --> 03:28:35,050
That's crazy.

2786
03:28:35,450 --> 03:28:37,570
We have to sell at home.

2787
03:28:39,050 --> 03:28:40,770
Will you be okay?

2788
03:28:41,050 --> 03:28:42,890
Just running over with a fucking car.

2789
03:28:43,350 --> 03:28:48,530
A bug is still a bug I think you guys are forgetting an
important fact.

2790
03:28:48,950 --> 03:29:09,990
I'm a fiend Hey ugly if you want to run now, I'll let you go
help Oh my god Guys, I don't think he liked that Dad, what

2791
03:29:09,990 --> 03:29:11,150
the fuck?

2792
03:29:11,830 --> 03:29:13,050
You're not so tough.

2793
03:29:17,330 --> 03:29:17,950
No.

2794
03:29:20,810 --> 03:29:23,690
Better be careful, Shiva.

2795
03:29:24,390 --> 03:29:26,970
There's one weakness, a fucking punch.

2796
03:29:28,050 --> 03:29:31,170
We'll attack any and every living creature on site.

2797
03:29:37,620 --> 03:29:38,160
Oh, shit.

2798
03:29:38,280 --> 03:29:38,900
My bad.

2799
03:29:40,260 --> 03:29:42,420
What the fuck put your shirt back on?

2800
03:29:42,700 --> 03:29:43,700
He never had a shirt.

2801
03:29:44,280 --> 03:29:46,740
God, he looks so much more naked without the cape.

2802
03:29:47,980 --> 03:29:51,580
Makes me feel so weird.

2803
03:29:51,800 --> 03:29:53,440
It's just weird.

2804
03:29:57,480 --> 03:29:58,440
He's just...

2805
03:29:58,440 --> 03:29:58,960
Sorry.

2806
03:30:04,590 --> 03:30:05,490
Come on, then.

2807
03:30:06,130 --> 03:30:06,810
Bring it.

2808
03:30:06,970 --> 03:30:08,230
Is it because he has no kniflers?

2809
03:30:08,490 --> 03:30:09,490
Maybe that's why.

2810
03:30:09,870 --> 03:30:10,810
Appreciate it, old man.

2811
03:30:11,210 --> 03:30:13,030
But it's way too dangerous for you.

2812
03:30:13,230 --> 03:30:13,770
Got it?

2813
03:30:13,950 --> 03:30:15,310
Hide in the tank with feet.

2814
03:30:16,710 --> 03:30:18,970
Oh, shit, critical!

2815
03:30:19,870 --> 03:30:21,090
Right off the bat!

2816
03:30:24,250 --> 03:30:26,730
Bro, how did you get a critical that fast?

2817
03:30:31,110 --> 03:30:32,370
Guys, I fucked up.

2818
03:30:36,850 --> 03:30:38,450
Guys, I learned how to lock in.

2819
03:30:38,570 --> 03:30:43,750
It only took me, like, it only took me, like, a couple of
playthroughs.

2820
03:30:45,510 --> 03:30:46,350
Jesus Christ.

2821
03:30:46,370 --> 03:30:46,710
Christ.

2822
03:30:47,710 --> 03:30:49,930
Okay, we gotta get out of the way.

2823
03:30:52,330 --> 03:30:53,430
Oh, ha.

2824
03:30:53,790 --> 03:30:55,130
You almost got me, bro.

2825
03:30:55,810 --> 03:30:56,370
Oh, shit!

2826
03:30:57,390 --> 03:30:59,770
He's, like, stomping on me like a bug!

2827
03:31:00,370 --> 03:31:02,130
He's treating me like the bug!

2828
03:31:04,410 --> 03:31:11,030
I like how, like, it's just one of them that's taking
fucking forever, but there's, like, 20 pods behind us.

2829
03:31:11,790 --> 03:31:12,270
Like...

2830
03:31:15,170 --> 03:31:16,730
That's, like, the awkward part.

2831
03:31:18,210 --> 03:31:18,850
No, no, no, no, no.

2832
03:31:19,050 --> 03:31:19,670
Oh, okay.

2833
03:31:20,050 --> 03:31:20,690
I was gonna stay outside.

2834
03:31:21,310 --> 03:31:21,630
Miss.

2835
03:31:25,470 --> 03:31:27,850
Like, there's literally 20 different pods.

2836
03:31:30,690 --> 03:31:32,330
I did it.

2837
03:31:39,860 --> 03:31:39,980
Oh.

2838
03:31:42,060 --> 03:31:43,580
The other pods are easy.

2839
03:31:48,270 --> 03:31:49,690
Oh, there's more.

2840
03:31:53,720 --> 03:31:55,300
Oh, that's awkward.

2841
03:31:57,680 --> 03:31:58,680
Oh no!

2842
03:31:59,580 --> 03:32:00,310
Oh my god!

2843
03:32:02,140 --> 03:32:03,580
It's not blood, it's just saliva.

2844
03:32:04,620 --> 03:32:07,680
Believe me, you haven't really seen the prince yet.

2845
03:32:12,380 --> 03:32:15,820
You demons have been a thorn in my side for decades.

2846
03:32:16,160 --> 03:32:19,640
But with this, it won't be long before none of you remain.

2847
03:32:19,800 --> 03:32:21,560
Like how the theme was like, don't help him.

2848
03:32:21,820 --> 03:32:22,500
Every wonder estimates Prince B.

2849
03:32:22,560 --> 03:32:22,980
Elzebub.

2850
03:32:23,600 --> 03:32:25,480
Because of how kind-hearted he is.

2851
03:32:26,120 --> 03:32:34,900
you seem to have forgotten something he said he is the most
fearsome fiend in the world he was telling the truth it's

2852
03:32:34,900 --> 03:32:46,460
gonna be a super scene and unleashes the power of darkness
you'll learn the meaning of fear i don't know it's these i'm

2853
03:32:46,460 --> 03:32:48,760

He'll be okay.

2874
03:35:56,740 --> 03:35:58,440

Commander Zayu.

2879
03:36:37,180 --> 03:36:38,920
He's committed war crimes.

2880
03:36:40,360 --> 03:36:42,460
One more kill would mean nothing.

2881
03:36:42,560 --> 03:36:48,800
To be fair, he's gonna die of old age, like in one next
week.

2882
03:36:48,940 --> 03:36:51,540
General Shiva, reporting for my new assignment.

2884
03:36:53,580 --> 03:36:57,320
General, we'll protect our home, no matter what it takes.

2885
03:36:58,460 --> 03:36:59,200
I'm a father now.

2886
03:36:59,980 --> 03:37:00,660
Here's my son.

2887
03:37:02,040 --> 03:37:02,720
Isn't he cute?

2892
03:37:16,640 --> 03:37:17,920
For you, I have no mercy.

2893
03:37:19,400 --> 03:37:19,840
Do it!

2894
03:37:19,920 --> 03:37:20,720
Pull the trigger!

2895
03:37:26,390 --> 03:37:27,070
Is she dead?

2896
03:37:29,190 --> 03:37:30,370
Did he do it?

2897
03:37:33,840 --> 03:37:35,760
Did he actually do it?

2898
03:37:44,050 --> 03:37:44,610
Bro.

2899
03:37:44,970 --> 03:37:45,610
Bro.

2900
03:37:50,150 --> 03:37:51,970
He didn't do it.

2901
03:37:52,110 --> 03:37:53,400
What a fucking little bitch

2902
03:37:56,740 --> 03:38:00,990
Did your diaper exceeded maximum limit thinking of a super
chat thing?

2903
03:38:04,610 --> 03:38:09,070
Still every bit as gullible as you used to be aren't you?

2904
03:38:10,650 --> 03:38:16,350
You should have tilt the shine This is bad would you show
some respect?

2905
03:38:22,760 --> 03:38:24,960
Oh, he could jump that high?

2906
03:38:47,200 --> 03:38:49,760
Why do we need a fucking car to jump?

2907
03:39:09,360 --> 03:39:11,160
And now for the grand finale.

2908
03:39:12,060 --> 03:39:13,500
Oh my god, we did it.

2909
03:39:14,680 --> 03:39:17,600
We're gonna bring back one to the sand.

2910
03:39:20,240 --> 03:39:21,940
All right, this is a good spot.

2911
03:39:21,980 --> 03:39:25,260
The rest of the world must have been like, what the fuck is
going on?

2912
03:39:26,880 --> 03:39:27,660

2927
03:40:54,560 --> 03:40:58,240
Bro, they spent everything on those insect men and then I
beat the shit out of them.

2928
03:40:59,280 --> 03:41:03,640
Unfortunately, I'm about to be canned for betraying my oath
of duty.

2929
03:41:05,160 --> 03:41:09,600
I'm in no position to spare so much as 3,000, any, let alone
30 million.

2930
03:41:11,880 --> 03:41:12,440

2947
03:43:22,470 --> 03:43:36,430
that the water has returned to the river yeah for everyone
in sandland again oh oh is that so how wonderful and the

2948
03:43:36,430 --> 03:43:42,630
attack on the peachy was a heinous conspiracy carried out by
commander zeo who acted with full knowledge that what he was

2949
03:43:42,630 --> 03:43:53,510
doing was wrong where the king is gonna get away with it how
about this why don't you share half of your own personal

2950
03:43:53,510 --> 03:44:00,510
fortune with both the citizens of this country and the few
remaining peachy huh if rumors got out about you being

2951
03:44:00,510 --> 03:44:08,650
complicit in zeo's scheme to cause and profit off the water
shortage that might sully your reputation suggest making a

2952
03:44:08,650 --> 03:44:16,030
serious effort to recapture the hearts of the people unless
you want me it's gonna blackmail him

2953
03:44:24,430 --> 03:44:34,490

expect nothing less from our esteemed and honorable king of

2954
03:44:34,490 --> 03:44:42,910
sandland Because military rule is also is definitely a
better alternative The military will be in your hands

2955
03:44:42,910 --> 03:44:46,750
instead of zeus Me commander don't be absurd.

03:50:36,000 --> 03:50:37,380
I need to follow your example.

3011
03:50:38,460 --> 03:50:39,920
Thank you, one and all.

3012
03:50:40,120 --> 03:50:41,620
I promise to pull my weight.

3013
03:50:43,760 --> 03:50:45,300
The jump bot is now more powerful.

3014
03:50:46,860 --> 03:50:47,880
You can jump even higher.

3015
03:50:48,020 --> 03:50:49,600
Make good use to explore new regions.

3016
03:50:50,120 --> 03:50:50,660
Oh, nice.

3017
03:50:51,300 --> 03:50:52,260
Where's Better Anne?

3018
03:50:52,380 --> 03:50:52,580
Alright.

3019
03:50:52,860 --> 03:50:53,900
I'm going to use the bathroom real quick.

3020
03:50:53,960 --> 03:50:54,460
I'll bear it back.

3021
03:50:54,540 --> 03:50:55,660
You can look at Better Anne.

3022
03:52:09,080 --> 03:52:11,820
Ginger, Miracle, Alan, Duck, and Sess.

3023
03:52:11,980 --> 03:52:12,760
Thank you for the super chat.

3024
03:52:12,900 --> 03:52:13,740
Thank you, thank you.

3025
03:52:13,920 --> 03:52:15,920
Alright, it's time to upgrade our vehicle.

3026
03:52:16,320 --> 03:52:18,700
Wait, can I just talk to Polak to upgrade my stuff?

3027
03:52:20,060 --> 03:52:21,540
Thank you, one and all.

3028
03:52:22,780 --> 03:52:22,860
No!

3029
03:52:23,680 --> 03:52:26,740
What if I want better end to fix my vehicle?

3030
03:52:27,600 --> 03:52:29,600
I like it more.

3031
03:52:31,740 --> 03:52:33,400
It's not fair.

3032
03:52:35,100 --> 03:52:36,100
Alright, let's see.

3033
03:52:36,400 --> 03:52:38,520
We have the materials to upgrade to this.

3034
03:52:38,860 --> 03:52:39,960
And then, might as well.

3035
03:52:40,600 --> 03:52:41,720
Alright, and then...

3036
03:52:43,120 --> 03:52:44,600
I don't have enough mats.

3037
03:52:44,700 --> 03:52:46,720
Oh, I still need the fucking raptor steel.

3038
03:52:47,080 --> 03:52:49,140
I always need the raptor steel.

3039
03:52:50,080 --> 03:52:52,000
Okay, does it make it faster?

3040
03:52:52,880 --> 03:52:56,620
Okay, actually, I don't need to upgrade I'm not gonna
upgrade Scam.

3041
03:52:56,920 --> 03:53:02,680
I'm not I realize I don't need to upgrade Scam.

3042
03:53:03,140 --> 03:53:10,600
Alright, let's See, 162 Uh 28 28.

3043
03:53:10,780 --> 03:53:12,040
I can upgrade this actually.

3044
03:53:12,620 --> 03:53:13,260
No, I cannot.

3045
03:53:14,320 --> 03:53:15,320
I can upgrade this though.

3046
03:53:17,080 --> 03:53:17,840
Okay, max.

3047
03:53:19,160 --> 03:53:23,540
Uh What about...

3048
03:53:23,540 --> 03:53:24,360
Alright, nice.

3049
03:53:24,480 --> 03:53:25,300
It maxed out.

3050
03:53:25,860 --> 03:53:27,340
Okay, we don't need to upgrade Scam.

3051
03:53:27,640 --> 03:53:29,100
I'll never upgrade Scam.

3052
03:53:32,600 --> 03:53:34,560
I'll never upgrade you.

3053
03:53:35,300 --> 03:53:35,960
Alright, here we go.

3054
03:53:38,880 --> 03:53:41,260
Okay, we gotta go to see the mayor!

3055
03:53:41,800 --> 03:53:42,700
Wait, that's not the mayor.

3056
03:53:43,420 --> 03:53:45,620
We gotta go back up here?

3057
03:53:45,920 --> 03:53:46,920
Is the mayor up there?

3058
03:53:50,670 --> 03:53:51,450
He's so far.

3059
03:53:51,470 --> 03:53:51,850
fast?

3060
03:53:52,010 --> 03:53:55,070
Yes, but my upgrades don't upgrade the speed, guys.

3061
03:53:55,350 --> 03:53:56,950
It doesn't upgrade the speed.

3062
03:53:58,170 --> 03:54:01,330
It just attacks an HP and we don't need to worry about that.

3063
03:54:02,030 --> 03:54:02,830
Where do I go?

3064
03:54:05,510 --> 03:54:07,110
Where the fuck is the mission?

3065
03:54:07,270 --> 03:54:08,550
Oh, it's here.

3066
03:54:09,810 --> 03:54:10,770
The demon village.

3067
03:54:10,850 --> 03:54:12,070
Oh, I had to go back home.

3068
03:54:13,670 --> 03:54:15,730
I had to go back home and be like, I'm back, guys.

3069
03:54:16,970 --> 03:54:17,530
I'm back.

3070
03:54:17,990 --> 03:54:18,830
I did it.

3071
03:54:19,110 --> 03:54:20,850
Welcome home, Prince.

3072
03:54:21,490 --> 03:54:23,450
Guys, I got us water.

3073
03:54:25,550 --> 03:54:25,890
Yo!

3074
03:54:28,940 --> 03:54:32,280
You better not have been gaming while I was away.

3075
03:54:33,980 --> 03:54:35,660
Of course not.

3076
03:54:36,260 --> 03:54:39,520
We've been waiting patiently for your return this whole
time.

3077
03:54:39,600 --> 03:54:40,120
Oh, yeah?

3078
03:54:41,060 --> 03:54:43,280
Upgrade Scam, you coward!

3079
03:54:44,360 --> 03:54:47,440
Thank you for the acoustic fun.

3080
03:54:48,040 --> 03:54:48,320
Thank you.

3081
03:54:48,320 --> 03:54:49,880
It's time to get my game on.

3082
03:54:50,600 --> 03:54:52,540
If Scam had 100 fans.

3083
03:54:52,840 --> 03:54:54,620
I'm one of them.

3084
03:54:55,160 --> 03:54:56,740
Scam has zero fans.

3085
03:54:57,160 --> 03:54:58,840
It's because I'm dead.

3086
03:54:59,520 --> 03:55:00,840
Biggins number...

3087
03:55:01,420 --> 03:55:02,900
Scam's number one fan.

3088
03:55:05,520 --> 03:55:06,660
Oh, yeah.

3089
03:55:07,080 --> 03:55:07,240
Right.

3090
03:55:08,780 --> 03:55:13,000
I should go tell everyone back at Aputo Village what
happened to.

3091
03:55:14,420 --> 03:55:14,760
Gotcha.

3092
03:55:15,800 --> 03:55:17,080
You think you'll drop by again?

3093
03:55:18,320 --> 03:55:18,760
Sure.

3094
03:55:19,080 --> 03:55:20,160
Once things settle down.

3095
03:55:22,440 --> 03:55:22,820
Ha ha.

3096
03:55:22,840 --> 03:55:25,100
See you around then.

3097
03:55:26,800 --> 03:55:27,740
Goodbye, Grandpa.

3098
03:55:36,520 --> 03:55:37,940
I did it, Dad.

3099
03:55:41,980 --> 03:55:42,480
Boppity.

3100
03:55:46,090 --> 03:55:50,970
He's the only remaining Dragon Ball Z character to live, to
survive.

3101
03:55:56,690 --> 03:55:58,910
I gather your journey was fruitful.

3102
03:56:01,990 --> 03:56:02,910
Big.

3103
03:56:03,490 --> 03:56:06,870
the buddha good you may leave

3104
03:56:14,290 --> 03:56:20,410
how about we bump up game time to an hour and a half

3105
03:56:25,900 --> 03:56:41,900
he's the only one to lived out he outlived uh he had lived
all the other dragon ball z characters he's acquitted i get

3106
03:56:41,900 --> 03:56:47,900
to play 30 minutes more well maybe i I'm being too hasty.

3107
03:56:48,940 --> 03:56:52,560
Perhaps I should give these human games to try before I
judge them.

3108
03:57:02,060 --> 03:57:02,420
Yay!

3109
03:57:06,140 --> 03:57:12,760
I got I got game time.

3110
03:57:13,420 --> 03:57:14,100
Wait, he's back?

3111
03:57:14,260 --> 03:57:14,880
What the fuck?

3112
03:57:15,160 --> 03:57:15,920
Why is he back?

3113
03:57:16,280 --> 03:57:17,240
I did my job.

3114
03:57:19,040 --> 03:57:22,020
Oh my god, am I gonna get two PlayStation's?

3115
03:57:22,180 --> 03:57:23,680
These supplies are for them.

3116
03:57:24,420 --> 03:57:25,460
Want to come?

3117
03:57:28,520 --> 03:57:29,680
Yeah, I do.

3118
03:57:30,820 --> 03:57:31,840
Oh, shucks.

3119
03:57:32,540 --> 03:57:34,340
I guess I'll tag along too.

3120
03:57:34,620 --> 03:57:36,260
Now for season two.

3121
03:57:38,620 --> 03:57:39,380
Oh, that's right.

3122
03:57:39,680 --> 03:57:40,980
I've got a present for me.

3123
03:57:42,080 --> 03:57:46,140
Got this bot part as a peace offering from those little
punks who wrecked my car.

I think I did everything.

3141
03:59:38,060 --> 03:59:39,080
I got blue upgrades?

3142
03:59:39,160 --> 03:59:39,520
Not yet.

3143
03:59:40,140 --> 03:59:41,360
I got upgrades, apparently.

3144
03:59:41,700 --> 03:59:42,520

3145
03:59:43,340 --> 03:59:44,020

03:59:52,340 --> 03:59:53,060
Extra armor!

3149
03:59:55,120 --> 03:59:56,920
Wait, I better have extra armor.

3150
03:59:57,500 --> 03:59:58,140

3151
03:59:59,060 --> 04:00:00,140
What better dragons?

3152
04:00:01,320 --> 04:00:01,980
You're already good.

3153
04:00:02,060 --> 04:00:03,680
You don't need anything, apparently.

3154
04:00:07,180 --> 04:00:08,300
Shotgun grenade.

3155
04:00:14,080 --> 04:00:15,020
Okay, nice.

3156
04:00:16,300 --> 04:00:16,880
Quest in the middle.

No, that should...

3158
04:00:18,120 --> 04:00:19,660
That's just Miao Jin Bu.

3159
04:00:21,800 --> 04:00:22,980
I mean, I could talk to him.

3160
04:00:26,600 --> 04:00:29,900
I don't think I'm gonna be doing anything, but I could talk
to him.

3161
04:00:30,420 --> 04:00:30,900
Hey!

3162
04:00:31,360 --> 04:00:32,680
Nice to see you again.

3163
04:00:33,160 --> 04:00:34,460
Is it just my imagination?

3164
04:00:34,760 --> 04:00:36,440
Or has the town gotten more lively?

3165
04:00:36,940 --> 04:00:37,420
Oh, yeah.

3166
04:00:37,860 --> 04:00:38,980
I found something cool.

3167
04:00:39,200 --> 04:00:39,760
Oh, shit.

3168
04:00:40,020 --> 04:00:40,720
Raptor Steel.

3169
04:00:40,800 --> 04:00:41,480
I need that.

3170
04:00:41,800 --> 04:00:43,960
Wait, he actually gives me stuff?

3171
04:00:45,040 --> 04:00:45,520
God.

3172
04:00:45,760 --> 04:00:46,700
We don't need treasure.

3173
04:00:47,880 --> 04:00:49,060
We don't want to fucking...

3174
04:00:49,800 --> 04:00:51,840
I haven't found any ruins.

3175
04:00:58,400 --> 04:00:58,740
Alright.

3176
04:01:01,100 --> 04:01:02,020
I'm ready.

3177
04:01:02,440 --> 04:01:03,220
I'm ready to go.

3178
04:01:04,240 --> 04:01:04,480
Yeah.

3179
04:01:05,120 --> 04:01:05,360
Yep.

3180
04:01:06,060 --> 04:01:06,520
All good.

3181
04:01:07,600 --> 04:01:08,880
Let's hit the road then.

3182
04:01:10,440 --> 04:01:10,780
Yeah.

3183
04:01:12,240 --> 04:01:17,160
Have you been back to see the Peachy at all since we busted
the dam?

3184
04:01:18,480 --> 04:01:19,660
I've still got enough.

3185
04:01:19,740 --> 04:01:21,120
I'll keep them lore before I fast travel.

3186
04:01:21,360 --> 04:01:22,240
South alone.

3187
04:01:23,780 --> 04:01:24,780
That's done?

3188
04:01:25,200 --> 04:01:26,940
Alright, where is it?

3189
04:01:30,040 --> 04:01:30,640
Yeah!

3190
04:01:31,640 --> 04:01:32,360
Fast travel!

3191
04:01:35,580 --> 04:01:36,700
We did it.

3192
04:01:37,960 --> 04:01:41,520
I wonder if the Peachy could make me a new game console if I
asked.

3193
04:01:42,720 --> 04:01:47,320
You'd be lucky to get off with cleaning the whole village if
King Lucifer found out about that.

3194
04:01:48,180 --> 04:01:48,780
Hello, Elder.

3195
04:01:49,100 --> 04:01:51,580

3199
04:02:21,080 --> 04:02:26,500
gun What the fuck is this guy doing with a gun?

3200
04:02:26,500 --> 04:02:28,280
Yes, designed for self-defense.

3201
04:02:28,680 --> 04:02:32,980
A gun.

3202
04:02:34,320 --> 04:02:35,760
Non-lethal.

3203
04:02:38,440 --> 04:02:41,780
Bro, what am I gonna do with a non-lethal gun?

3204
04:02:42,760 --> 04:02:42,780
Really?

3205
04:02:43,400 --> 04:02:44,780
That does sound handy.

3206
04:02:46,380 --> 04:02:46,400
What?

3207
04:02:46,880 --> 04:02:50,100
Quite the peaceful solution to conflict, wouldn't you say?

3208
04:02:50,640 --> 04:02:52,020
The peaceful solution.

3209
04:02:53,460 --> 04:02:55,000
It's okay, it's not lethal.

3210
04:02:55,620 --> 04:02:56,920
It's just a tazer.

3211
04:03:01,050 --> 04:03:02,810
It's a good gun, guys.

3212
04:03:03,010 --> 04:03:06,430
As a sheriff, I'm sure you can make good use of it.

3213
04:03:07,630 --> 04:03:07,630
Definitely.

3214
04:03:08,190 --> 04:03:08,790
Thank you.

3215
04:03:09,810 --> 04:03:11,770
Well, we best be on our way.

3216
04:03:12,730 --> 04:03:13,990
Can't you stay a little longer?

3217
04:03:14,370 --> 04:03:15,910
We've much to catch up on.

3218
04:03:16,490 --> 04:03:19,730
Let me tell you about all the people that survive from your
murders.

3219
04:03:21,530 --> 04:03:23,810
I suppose we don't have to leave right away.

3220
04:03:25,010 --> 04:03:30,450
You want to hang out with all the people you fucking
traumatized for the rest of their lives?

3221
04:03:34,330 --> 04:03:35,650
I might as well go to the radio tower.

3222
04:03:35,890 --> 04:03:37,930
I realize we haven't done anything with the radio tower over
there.

3223
04:03:42,420 --> 04:03:44,420
Let's head to the radio tower.

3224
04:03:45,580 --> 04:03:46,280
And then we'll talk.

3225
04:03:46,380 --> 04:03:47,020
Hello, monkeys.

04:03:47,980 --> 04:03:49,440
Oh, I can't punch when I'm running.

3227
04:03:52,300 --> 04:03:54,300
How do we get to the radio tower up top?

3228
04:03:55,300 --> 04:03:56,100

If I eat all of them, I'll fly even higher!

3241
04:05:31,890 --> 04:05:33,670
It's called a floaty tablet.

3242
04:05:34,390 --> 04:05:36,090
You could have more if you want.

3243
04:05:36,270 --> 04:05:37,930
Wonka if he made peas.

3244
04:05:39,410 --> 04:05:43,350
I can't see how these will be useful, but sure, why not?

3245
04:05:45,450 --> 04:05:48,490
Anyway, you peachy are good with bots, right?

3246

true.

3252
04:06:32,000 --> 04:06:35,560
Especially, like, you can actually, like, lose an eye from
it, too, and shit like that.

3253
04:06:39,320 --> 04:06:40,560
Alright, let's see.

3254
04:06:41,720 --> 04:06:42,680
We gotta...

3255
04:06:42,680 --> 04:06:43,940
I can fly now!

3256
04:06:44,220 --> 04:06:45,160
How do I eat it?

3257
04:06:45,540 --> 04:06:47,140
How do I eat my item?

3258
04:06:48,260 --> 04:06:48,740
Consumables.

3259
04:06:49,460 --> 04:06:50,180
What's it called?

3260
04:06:51,700 --> 04:06:52,960
What the fuck is it called?

3261
04:06:53,060 --> 04:06:53,920
The floaty tablet?

3262
04:06:54,220 --> 04:06:55,980
I can't even actually eat it!

3263
04:06:56,060 --> 04:06:57,060
It's just...

3264
04:06:59,580 --> 04:07:00,340
It's just...

3265
04:07:00,440 --> 04:07:02,380
aesthetics in my inventory.

3266
04:07:08,370 --> 04:07:08,890
Alright.

3267
04:07:09,490 --> 04:07:09,490
Nice.

3268
04:07:09,570 --> 04:07:11,770
I got standard spring and standard gear.

3269
04:07:14,150 --> 04:07:15,850
I can't believe it.

3270
04:07:16,770 --> 04:07:18,730
I just, just, it's just there to look pretty.

3271
04:07:18,790 --> 04:07:21,030
It's just there to take up my inventory space.

3272
04:07:22,390 --> 04:07:24,490
At least there's no, like, weight in this.

3273
04:07:24,650 --> 04:07:26,990
So I don't have to worry about being cumbered.

3274
04:07:28,270 --> 04:07:29,690
He left the village.

3275
04:07:30,110 --> 04:07:31,890
Saying he needed some time alone.

3276
04:07:32,150 --> 04:07:33,150
Oh no, He's emo.

3277
04:07:34,210 --> 04:07:35,650
Alright, let's go after him.

3278
04:07:36,610 --> 04:07:37,190
Alright.

3279
04:07:38,530 --> 04:07:41,190
Would you pass on a message to Rao for me?

3280
04:07:41,990 --> 04:07:48,930
Even now that this vast river has returned, there are some
mistakes that can't be washed away.

3281
04:07:49,710 --> 04:07:54,690
But with the help of your new companions, your future can be
bright and unblemished.

3282
04:07:55,010 --> 04:07:57,330
He's just suffered from PTSD at the moment.

3283
04:07:58,250 --> 04:07:58,690
Got it.

3284
04:07:59,030 --> 04:07:59,650
I'll let him know.

3285
04:08:02,030 --> 04:08:02,610
Alright.

3286
04:08:02,670 --> 04:08:05,730
I think I'm gonna call it here guys.

3287
04:08:06,110 --> 04:08:11,410
Oh my god, I've been playing for four hours Okay, not gonna
lie the longer I play this game.

3288
04:08:11,590 --> 04:08:16,710
I feel like the better it gets I'm gonna go save, but I'm
not gonna show you guys the save because I don't know if

3289
04:08:16,710 --> 04:08:25,390
it's gonna like freak out again But I've been enjoying the
lore of the store it's freaking out by the way, so that

3290
04:08:25,390 --> 04:08:35,370
that's good that like Let's get that I tabbed it out for you
guys but I've been enjoying the game a lot so far I think I

3291
04:08:35,370 --> 04:08:43,470
like I've been the story has been like pretty interesting
and like apparently um where we stopped at uh when we

3292
04:08:43,470 --> 04:08:51,010
defeated the commander is where the manga ended manga and
anime ended right or is the manga anime still going I don't

3293
04:08:51,010 --> 04:09:00,650
know sure not sure and the anime is still going but um so
like after that is when there's like new stuff i haven't

3294
04:09:00,650 --> 04:09:09,650
watched the anime before so like i don't i'm not sure yet
because i wanted i wouldn't implied um but the story so far

3295
04:09:09,650 --> 04:09:19,370
i really actually uh i actually really enjoyed the story so
far and the fact that there's more to it it felt like it was

3296
04:09:19,370 --> 04:09:30,910
the end and then they were like by the way this is only
chapter 14 of 31 i'm like huh 14 out of 30 what you mean 14

3297
04:09:30,910 --> 04:09:41,930
out of 31 uh but i uh it's been very enjoyable so far it
sucks that this game isn't more popular i thought this game

3298
04:09:41,930 --> 04:09:49,510
would have been like super popular because it's the first
game released post like the passing of tori uh toriama um

3299
04:09:49,510 --> 04:09:57,650
and the fact that like i think it's also because okay i
think not gonna lie i think the reason why this game was not

3300
04:09:57,650 --> 04:10:11,070
is not as popular Because Stellar Blade released at the same
time So and Stellar Blade had more like I guess like There's

3301
04:10:11,070 --> 04:10:20,810
more more things going around with Stellar Blade Than there
was about like in terms of like There were a lot of things

3302
04:10:20,810 --> 04:10:23,850
news going around with Stellar Blade So

3303
04:10:28,210 --> 04:10:41,490
So um um so it's unfortunate that sandland released at the
same time and um and yeah stellar blade got a lot of free

3304
04:10:41,490 --> 04:10:50,330
publicity um but i honestly really i've been really enjoying
i've been really enjoying uh um sandland so far cats thank

3305
04:10:50,330 --> 04:10:55,050
you for the super chat thank you thank you the story is
super cool never heard of sandland before but i really

3306
04:10:55,050 --> 04:10:57,910
wanted to get into the manga and game show now Thanks for
the stream on it so far.

3307
04:10:58,050 --> 04:10:58,590
Thank you, the super chat.

3308
04:10:58,710 --> 04:10:58,930
Thank you.

3309
04:10:59,250 --> 04:10:59,450
Thank you.

3310
04:10:59,870 --> 04:11:04,110
Yeah, it's actually, I've actually been enjoying it a lot
late, like the story.

3311
04:11:04,710 --> 04:11:07,270
And I think it's also because it's like an action RPG.

3312
04:11:07,650 --> 04:11:12,170
I know I'm not doing a lot of the side quests because I've
never been like a side quest person.

3313
04:11:14,350 --> 04:11:18,630
I really, I really just want to know more about the main
story too.

3314
04:11:18,790 --> 04:11:21,990
I found the main story to be really interesting.

3315
04:11:22,110 --> 04:11:25,890
But I just want to progress the main story just to see
what's going on.

3316
04:11:27,030 --> 04:11:29,790
And, like, just want to see what's going to happen next.

3317
04:11:30,070 --> 04:11:32,730
Also, the vehicles are really fun to use and stuff.

3318
04:11:35,550 --> 04:11:37,890
And your town has no features.

3319
04:11:38,150 --> 04:11:40,490
Because there's no side quests.

3320
04:11:43,970 --> 04:11:46,690
When can I use my chairs?

3321
04:11:47,870 --> 04:11:50,670
Is it because I didn't do the side quests?

3322
04:11:50,970 --> 04:11:53,830
So I can't use my chairs?

3323
04:11:53,990 --> 04:11:54,210
Is

3324
04:11:57,400 --> 04:11:58,060

Who has...

3351
04:14:58,320 --> 04:15:01,180
Okay, the PlayStation people actually have to type this out.

3352
04:15:01,520 --> 04:15:04,440
So, like, they have to type this out.

3353
04:15:04,740 --> 04:15:08,940
Oh, by the way, the Xbox code is fucking long.

3354
04:15:13,320 --> 04:15:15,520
Oh, I see someone got it!

3355
04:15:15,860 --> 04:15:16,240

I thought you had to type this out.

3376
04:16:05,160 --> 04:16:06,100
I don't know about Xbox.

3377
04:16:06,260 --> 04:16:08,300
Can you guys claim it on the website as well?

3378
