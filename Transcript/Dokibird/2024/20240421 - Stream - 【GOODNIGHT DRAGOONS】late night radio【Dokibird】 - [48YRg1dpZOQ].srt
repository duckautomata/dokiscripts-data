1
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:51,480
Hellooo!

2
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,760
Hello everybody!

3
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,660
Let me get my lo-fi in.

4
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,160
Give me a sec.

5
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,200
Now it's actual late night radio.

6
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,720
Hello everyone.

7
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,240
I hope the music isn't too loud though.

8
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,780
I'll turn it down a little bit just in case.

9
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,400
Oh, so this is gonna be... Hello!

10
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,000
Hello, hello guys!

11
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,480
So for those who are new here, what is Goodnight Dragoons?

12
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,500
Um... Goodnight Dragoons is just gonna be like... I think I'm gonna... I want to do this like...

13
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,540
I'm gonna try and do this like once every week.

14
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,680
Um, maybe like every Saturday or Friday.

15
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,160
Um, and it's basically like a chill late night session.

16
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,700
Because I always see a lot of Vtubers that do like morning radio shows or like morning streams.

17
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,640
And it'll be like... like, like you know, like, like mor... like, oh hey!

18
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,600
This is the first thing you listen to in the morning!

19
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,460
Um, I'm not a moron.

20
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,020
I'm a morning person.

21
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,420
As we all know, I'm not a morning person at all.

22
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,100
Uh, I'm most like... I'm mostly a night person.

23
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:58,800
A night owl.

24
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,940
So, uh, I was like, you know what would be better than a good morning radio show?

25
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,640
A good night radio show.

26
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,640
Because at least I'll be awake.

27
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,820
Uh, so usually I'll just do this like before I sleep.

28
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,620
Or like, you know, most likely, I don't know.

29
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,180
Sometimes I might be going to bed after the stream.

30
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,300
Maybe not because I do have a lot of work to do.

31
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,660
I've been procrastinating.

32
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:25,520
Not procrastinating, but like, um, I've been like taking a lot more naps than usual.

33
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,700
Uh, and because of that, I'm so behind on a lot of things.

34
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,040
I'm so, I'm so behind.

35
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,760
I have like so many things to do behind the scenes at the moment.

36
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,560
And I'm like, uh oh.

37
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,140
Uh oh.

38
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,560
Uh oh.

39
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,280
Uh oh.

40
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,820
Uh oh.

41
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,740
Um, but that's basically it.

42
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:51,040
It's basically just like a late night, uh, like I guess you can call it like a late night podcast.

43
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,720
Oh my gosh, speaking of that.

44
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,560
Okay, this is a little already off topic.

45
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,060
But like, I don't know if you guys, there's been like a new trend at the moment.

46
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:05,020
Where, um, also I guess like the stream is also good for those who are on the other side of the world.

47
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,740
And you guys don't have to wake up super early for me anymore.

48
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,880
Um, well, for not, not anymore.

49
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:15,720
But like at least once a week, you guys have this afternoon slash a little bit of a stream.

50
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,640
I'm gonna set up the morning radio show for you guys on the other side of the world.

51
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,800
Um, so it's not that bad.

52
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,640
Cause like I usually rarely stream at these type of hours.

53
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,800
But I wanna do this, like I wanna try and be like super consistent.

54
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,060
I'm not gonna do this every day.

55
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,040
Cause, um, I don't have the stamina for that.

56
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,960
And like I, I, I...

57
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,140
I...

58
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,800
Guys, I, I need time to do other stuff too.

59
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,220
So...

60
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,960
So, this is just gonna be like maybe I'll try to do this like every Saturday.

61
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,240
Um, every Saturday at the same time.

62
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,960
Like 9pm PSTNList or something.

63
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,260
That's happening on Saturday.

64
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,520
I'm gonna try to make this like super consistent on having this every Saturday.

65
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,780
Um, and I chose Saturday because, um...

66
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,000
I see it as like, you know, the weekend type deal.

67
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,120
For people in NA.

68
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,600
So like, cause I know like, you know, 9...

69
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,660
It's, it's 1am... what is it?

70
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,920
It's like midnight for the Easties over there.

71
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,120
It's midnight for the Easties over there.

72
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,700
So like you have an excuse to stay up for like, you know, like...

73
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,460
For a little bit longer.

74
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,960
You stay up for a little bit longer for the stream.

75
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,660
And, um...

76
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,700
And, ah...

77
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,500
And it's also like not too early for those on the other side of the world.

78
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,040
And not too...

79
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,760
Cause I want it to be like the perfect balance.

80
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,040
Well, it's not perfect.

81
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,820
But like a good balance between like, you know, uh...

82
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,140
People in NA and people on the other side of the world.

83
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,540
And I'm very sorry to the EU goons though.

84
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,740
People in SA too.

85
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,680
I'm really sorry for the EU goons.

86
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,340
Because like, um...

87
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,720
EU goons ain't fucking faring so well lately.

88
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,600
I'm so sorry for the EU goons.

89
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,560
I'll try my best.

90
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,400
Um...

91
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,420
You guys still have your 12.30pm streams though.

92
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,400
So...

93
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,160
At least...

94
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,240
At least you got that.

95
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,620
It's always so hard though.

96
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,340
Um...

97
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,900
I always want to have like...

98
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,300
At least one stream.

99
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,260
For some...

100
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,680
Like for people around the world.

101
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:18,580
Um...

102
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,420
Always just one stream for you.

103
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,220
Like at least...

104
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,340
Not one.

105
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,260
But like at least one stream where...

106
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,280
Where people can catch my streams.

107
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,140
You know, like...

108
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,180
Just at least one of them.

109
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:30,840
So...

110
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,780
So I try my best to balance as best...

111
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,700
As much as I can.

112
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:35,820
Uh...

113
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,420
Mehdi!

114
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,560

Thank you.

116
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,420
Thank you.

117
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,560
Doki's very own late night talk show.

118
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,580
The next Jimmy Fallon.

119
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,600
Thank you for the super chat.

120
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:44,960
Thank you.

121
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,540
Thank you.

122
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,080
Jesus.

123
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,040
Thank you for the super chat.

124
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:47,340
Thank you.

125
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:47,720
Thank you.

126
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,500
Oh my god.

127
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,100
As someone in NA who's maintained aircraft on the mid shift.

128
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,080
This is great for me.

129
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,600
I'm so glad you're making this a thing.

130
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,400
Thank you for the super chat.

131
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:55,740
Thank you.

132
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,160
Thank you.

133
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,700
Oh my god.

134
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,160
Jesus.

135
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,720
You have your own very...

136
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,580
Own plane.

137
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,220
Oh yes.

138
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:00,860
I forgot.

139
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,540
Doki Airlines.

140
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,860
You reincarnated into a plane.

141
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,700
Thank you Jesus.

142
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:05,740
Uh...

143
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:05,980
Crow.

144
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:06,500
Doki.

145
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,260
Go to bed.

146
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,100
Thank you for the super chat.

147
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:08,440
Thank you.

148
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:08,920
Thank you.

149
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,700
I actually...

150
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,080
Okay.

151
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,500
I think it's just because I've been like working a lot lately.

152
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,660
But...

153
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,320
Um...

154
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,520
I've actually...

155
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,060
Uh...

156
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,840
I've been like taking a lot of naps lately.

157
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,800
So...

158
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,420
Um...

159
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,360
The past like...

160
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,400
I think the past like...

161
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,400
Three plus days I've been like napping more.

162
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,320
Um...

163
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,300
I think it's because like I've been working a lot lately.

164
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:28,860
So...

165
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,940
My energy level has been like a lot lower than usual.

166
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,100
Um...

167
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,540
And...

168
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,100
Like...

169
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,720
Oh my gosh.

170
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,180
I felt really bad because...

171
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,900
During that collab...

172
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,260
Uh...

173
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,900
With Juna, Bri, and Kai...

174
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,280
Uh...

175
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,560
My brain was so fucking fried.

176
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,200
Because I just woke up from a nap.

177
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,720
And I don't know why I do this.

178
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,560
I always be like...

179
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,500
I was like...

180
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,360
Okay...

181
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,240
Doki...

182
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,820
Uh...

183
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,320
Doki...

184
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,060
What...

185
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,160
This nap won't fuck you up too badly.

186
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,580
Every time.

187
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,540
I don't...

188
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,300
Oh my god.

189
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:02,880
Every time.

190
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,380
I don't...

191
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,620
I need to learn to not nap before stream.

192
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,360
Because like...

193
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:06,700
I'm like...

194
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,700
My brain was like...

195
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,600
Trying to wake up before...

196
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,160
Before like...

197
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,440
Uh...

198
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,720
Before the stream.

199
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,760
And then like...

200
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,340
They were all like talking a lot.

201
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,380
In the...

202
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:16,940
In the call.

203
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,200
And I was just like...

204
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,880
Yeah...

205
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,260
I felt...

206
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,640
I felt so awkward before the stream.

207
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,700
Because I was still waking up.

208
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,560
So my brain was just like...

209
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:26,760
Oh...

210
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,800
Because like they all know each other.

211
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,700
I didn't...

212
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,360
I didn't really...

213
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,060
I was like the new person in the group.

214
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:31,880
Um...

215
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,060
So I was just like...

216
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:33,540
Oh gosh.

217
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,200
I feel awkward.

218
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,120
Oh my gosh.

219
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,360
My brain isn't...

220
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:36,680
My brain isn't...

221
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,940
Wired yet to be...

222
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,900
To like...

223
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,080
Interact with people.

224
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,840
My intro...

225
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,580
Introvert self is like...

226
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,800
Slowly waking up.

227
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,460
I felt less clever...

228
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,300
During the collab.

229
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:47,980
I felt like...

230
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,340
Oh my gosh.

231
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,360
I was rewatching the collab.

232
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,180
And I was like...

233
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:50,940
Oh my god.

234
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,620
If I was more awake...

235
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,960
I would have said this instead.

236
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:54,840
I would have been...

237
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,740
I would have been like...

238
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,120
Oh...

239
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,880
I would have like...

240
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,680
Role played more.

241
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,140
If I...

242
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,920
If I was more awake...

243
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,740
I would have been like...

244
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,120
You know...

245
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,720
We were making the jokes about the elderly.

246
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,500
I would have been like...

247
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:03,820
Sud...

248
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,640
Why don't you visit me in the retirement?

249
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,540
I would have said...

250
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,360
Shit like that.

251
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:07,900
I was like...

252
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,320
Oh my god.

253
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:08,820
Doki...

254
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,180
If you were more awake...

255
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,340
You would have been so much more clever in this collab.

256
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,340
You would have said more funny things.

257
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,600
I was like...

258
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,560
Doki...

259
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,380
Why are you just being reactive?

260
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,920
You would have been so clever if you were more awake.

261
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:27,980
Doki...

262
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,220
Lord Karosus...

263
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,660
Thank you for the akasupa.

264
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,360
Thank you.

265
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:31,960
Thank you.

266
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,760
I learned that taking naps are worthless.

267
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,360
I woke up one day in middle school.

268
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:36,520
And I was like...

269
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,500
I've been exhausted ever since.

270
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,200
Thank you for the akasupa.

271
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:42,860
Thank you.

272
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,480
Thank you.

273
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,780
I let my clippers down.

274
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,720
What would they clip from me now?

275
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,320
I'm glad you guys still like the collab.

276
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,820
I always want to try it.

277
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,560
I always want to improve myself in content creation.

278
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,000
So I was just like...

279
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,500
Oh my god.

280
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,080
I could have said this.

281
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,780
I could have said that.

282
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,200
But yes.

283
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,600
I do rewatch my VODs.

284
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,080
Just to be like...

285
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,240
Okay.

286
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,020
What can...

287
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:05,440
Not like...

288
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,460
Not like critique myself.

289
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,600
I rewatch my commentary skills.

290
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,080
I'm not going to critique my commentary.

291
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,020
But it's just like...

292
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,700
Technical wise.

293
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,200
I rewatch my VODs.

294
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,400
For technical wise.

295
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,300
And also like...

296
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:14,980
Sometimes I'm like...

297
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,120
Whoa.

298
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,220
I'm actually really funny.

299
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,270
I rewatch my VODs.

300
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:23,550
I was like...

301
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:23,910
Wow.

302
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,050
I'm actually really funny.

303
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,470
I'll be like...

304
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,530
I can't believe I came up with that.

305
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,510
Like...

306
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,010
But like...

307
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:33,430
I don't know.

308
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:33,970
Like today...

309
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,470
I rewatched the collab VODs.

310
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:35,750
I was like...

311
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,290
Oh my god.

312
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,230
I could have been funnier.

313
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,350
Like...

314
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,150
Oh my god.

315
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,030
Today I was like...

316
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,690
Today I actually was like...

317
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:42,090
Oh my god.

318
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,330
If I said that...

319
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,390
It would have been so fucking funny.

320
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,730
Why didn't I say that?

321
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:52,730
Because like...

322
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:53,570
You know how it's like...

323
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,390
I was a demon.

324
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,450
And we were joking about the bachelor party.

325
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:57,930
I could have been like...

326
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:58,110
Wow.

327
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,370
Who ordered a number 15?

328
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:03,430
Boutchika.

329
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:03,750
Wow.

330
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,790
I could have said that.

331
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:05,330
I was like...

332
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:05,830
Oh my god.

333
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,590
I set up the perfect joke.

334
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:08,350
I was like...

335
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,430
You were such a good chemicals...

336
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,150
And I didn't go full sugar.

337
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,970
A wig Dokie would have went full sugar.

338
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,270
I had done perfect donation.

339
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,170
Dokie.

340
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,430
You had done perfect thing.

341
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,430
You could have run.

342
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,210
Because I kept...

343
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:32,390
Like...

344
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,370
I was the demon.

345
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:44,410
I kept doing that attack where you're basically the bachelor party type deal.

346
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,270
I was like, I can't believe it.

347
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,550
I set up the perfect joke for this and I didn't.

348
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,950
There was no payoff.

349
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,790
I threw.

350
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,450
I fucking threw.

351
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:00,170
It would have been so good.

352
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:12,950
Anyway, yeah, my brain actually, my brain was like not awake.

353
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,330
It like slowly booted up.

354
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:22,550
The comedy sector of my brain was not fucking on at that time.

355
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,790
I need to remind myself to not take naps.

356
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,530
Not like, okay, to not take naps before a stream.

357
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,350
Because I swear to God, I feel like, I feel like...

358
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:40,130
I'm just like not... I realize I'm not as funny if I taking naps before the stream.

359
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:52,210
I was like, I was like, oh my God, I'm definitely funnier if I just don't take naps before the stream.

360
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:00,370
I definitely, I need to remind myself not to do it.

361
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,750
I need to remind myself not to nap before streams.

362
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:10,730
Because my brain just doesn't have enough time to boot up, boot up and be active.

363
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:15,230
And actually like, and actually create content.

364
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:19,070
Because I'm like still, still like legarthic and stuff like that.

365
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:27,550
Anyway, also, oh yeah, I got distracted a little bit, but I was also inspired.

366
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:32,670
I was also like inspired by...

367
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,430
It's the newest trend right now.

368
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,330
It's like a newest trend in content creating.

369
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:44,490
Where content creators are making these like new channels.

370
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:49,870
New channels where they edit their VODs in a way, they make compilation.

371
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:56,570
And they edit the VODs in a way where it's like videos you put before you start...

372
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,910
Like videos you put before you sleep type deal.

373
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,250
Like white noise.

374
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,350
Have you guys seen that lately?

375
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,110
I've been like, okay, wait.

376
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,770
There's this channel I've been like play...

377
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:07,590
It showed up on my recommended recently.

378
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,250
And it's been like...

379
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,990
So, oh my gosh, let me see if I can find it.

380
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,530
It's been showing up in my recommended.

381
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,370
I've been like watching it regularly.

382
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,010
Like whenever I before...

383
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:20,690
Like when I'm like heading to bed, I just put it on on my phone.

384
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,270
And just play in the background.

385
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:27,110
Just to like help me sleep because it's like white noise.

386
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,510
I'm trying to figure out...

387
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,890
Remember like what channel it was.

388
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,970
It was like showing up in my recommended a lot.

389
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,150
Yeah, sleep channels.

390
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:43,630
So, it's basically like a lot of like content creators now recently are making channels dedicated to like...

391
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:49,550
Giving me like editing the VODs in a way where you can play in the background.

392
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:56,450
And they basically like mute and lower all the loud sounds on those videos.

393
00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:03,590
And then they like mute and like lower the sounds and remove all the screams and everything.

394
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:06,130
And so like you can put it...

395
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,010
It's like the same vid.

396
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,330
It's almost the same video.

397
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,230
Just like you can put it in a background and you wouldn't like wake up to it.

398
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,190
Like stuff like that.

399
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:18,450
I'm trying to remember what channel it was that kept playing.

400
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,570
I kept getting recommended of...

401
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:23,890
That's basically...

402
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:24,950
Oh, it's fine.

403
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,110
Oh, it's fine.

404
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:26,430
Oh, it's fine.

405
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:26,770
Also...

406
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,350
Thank you for the magenta soup.

407
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,070
Thank you.

408
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:30,570
Thank you.

409
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,410
Finish watching your stream tips video.

410
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,870
Here's the tuition I can spare.

411
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:34,810
Just wondering though.

412
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,150
Should there be a personal Twitch to watch others and a work Twitch to stream as?

413
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,270
Thank you for the content.

414
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:40,430
No, because...

415
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:40,830
Why?

416
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:46,010
There's no point in having separate Twitch channels unless you want to be like incognito.

417
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,770
I don't have separate Twitch channels.

418
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,050
I usually just use one.

419
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:50,730
So...

420
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:56,430
So honestly like there's no need to unless you want to be like secret about who you want.

421
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:59,350
But even then you just get like BTTV.

422
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:00,930
I think that's that is it.

423
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:01,050
Yeah.

424
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,670
If you get BTTV, you can...

425
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:09,530
There's like anonymous mode where it logs you out of the Twitch chat.

426
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,650
It logs you out of the Twitch chat.

427
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,550
So like they can't...

428
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,850
People can't track where you're...

429
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:14,510
Who you're watching.

430
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,850
But obviously it's only available on...

431
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,370
It's only available on like PC.

432
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:21,810
It's not...

433
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,050
It doesn't exist on mobile.

434
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,290
So like I usually never watch streams on my phone anymore.

435
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,290
Because like...

436
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,530
I've noticed...

437
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:33,210
I've noticed people have been like stalking who I watch.

438
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,690
And then people would like at me in the chat.

439
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,150
And would be like, Whoa, Doki's here.

440
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:43,670
So...

441
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,810
So I just...

442
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:45,890
I just watch on PC.

443
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,030
Because...

444
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,130
I just watch on my PC because I have the...

445
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:54,130
I have the plugin that like puts me in anonymous mode.

446
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,270
So like people can't like look in the chat.

447
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,610
Like I'm like, Oh, I have to go to the chat list to find me.

448
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:01,030
Yeah.

449
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:01,950
Yeah.

450
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:02,990
There's like...

451
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,410
I was like, Oh, that's awkward.

452
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:09,930
Sean, thank you.

453
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:10,770
Thank you.

454
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:10,910
Thank you.

455
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:11,250
Thank you.

456
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,590
That sounds like a scam.

457
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,130
The brainwash viewers...

458
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:14,930
Thank you.

459
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:15,790
Thank you.

460
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,410
I'm trying to remember that channel.

461
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:19,390
Okay.

462
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:19,830
Okay.

463
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:20,590
I'm gonna like...

464
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:23,590
I'm gonna be like PNG for like one second.

465
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,250
Give me a sec.

466
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,590
Guys, this is important.

467
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,110
Like, now I'm dedicated.

468
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,290
I need to know.

469
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,690
I need to know what...

470
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:35,150
Because like, I always like, I put that channel in the background, but I can't remember it on top of my head now.

471
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:40,250
Now it's like, in my... now I'm like, you know like those moments where you're like, oh my god, what is it?

472
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,170
That's me right now.

473
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,550
That's me.

474
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:44,750
What do you mean?

475
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:45,350
Okay, there.

476
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:45,890
Oh, okay.

477
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:49,070
Was it Cat... Catty... Caris?

478
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,210
Catty... Caris?

479
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,450
I think that's... is that his name?

480
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,470
Was that the... he has a sleep channel, right?

481
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,810
Catty... Caris... Sleep.

482
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,150
Oh yeah, yeah!

483
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,070
Catty Sleeps!

484
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,210
Yeah.

485
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,970
This... this guy's video... this guy's like, videos...

486
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:10,550
has been like, in my recommended... for so long.

487
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,670
And it really helps.

488
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,930
I don't know what the fuck...

489
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,430
Okay, not gonna lie...

490
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,310
Okay.

491
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:24,110
Not gonna lie, I'll say this... I... I have no idea what his videos are.

492
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:29,650
Like, every time I put... I just put it in the background for actual white noise.

493
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:35,790
I have... I have no idea what his content is.

494
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,150
I literally forget what his content is.

495
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:43,270
I just put it on it because it was just really good white noise.

496
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,570
I just put it on as a background... ooh, something fell.

497
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:47,070
What fell?

498
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,830
Okay, not important.

499
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,530
I... I put it in the background and then he's like...

500
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:53,990
And I'm like...

501
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:07,210
So... I just... this is... like, I got a lot... there's also like, did you know... did you know gaming also has one too?

502
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,350
Did you know gaming?

503
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,070
Sleep.

504
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,030
I think it's... yeah, what was it?

505
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:13,450
Sleep.

506
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,510
Okay, did you know...

507
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,730
Video game facts to sleep?

508
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:17,990
Sleep too.

509
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:18,730
Yeah, this one.

510
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:24,150
I also have... I also do this one too.

511
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,050
Miku!

512
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,070
Thank you for the super chat!

513
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:29,990
Thank you, thank you!

514
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,150
Hi Dokie!

515
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,770
Just came from your Holokitty stream.

516
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,150
Sad I wasn't able to catch you live.

517
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,630
But so happy to know you, Sam.

518
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,390
Your Oshis are my Oshis too!

519
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,830
Tsudamono's too cute!

520
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,390
Thank you for the super chat!

521
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,530
Thank you, thank you!

522
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,790
That's fucking right.

523
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,250
You never forget your first... never forget.

524
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,970
I talked... I told this story before.

525
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:55,290
But for those who don't know about my history with Sanrio stuff...

526
00:19:55,290 --> 00:20:00,130
So like... also I hope that... is the music okay at an okay volume chat?

527
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,070
Is the music at an okay volume by the way?

528
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,550
But yes, anyway...

529
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:11,350
As I was saying, when I was like, growing up...

530
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:15,610
It wasn't just... I never had like a favorite Sanrio character.

531
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,990
Until... until... I... until I saw Tsudamono.

532
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,970
Wait, there's music?

533
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,370
Okay, I'll turn it up a little bit.

534
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:26,890
I'll turn it up a little bit.

535
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:34,990
Alright, so I never had a... I've never had a favorite Sanrio character until Tsudamono came into...

536
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,890
Came into the picture.

537
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,630
And the thing is...

538
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:44,730
Before then, it was... there used to be... I don't know if it's still around.

539
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,970
I don't know if it's still around.

540
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:51,510
But there was this other... it was a Korean... I think it was Korean store.

541
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,010
It was like, Goodnight Bear.

542
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,130
I think that's what... is that what he's called?

543
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,650
Goodnight Bear... no, that's not him.

544
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,450
It's that blue bear.

545
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,610
Blue bear... is it Korean?

546
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,950
Oh, it's literally Blue Bear!

547
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:06,770
Oh my god!

548
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:11,310
His name is... his name is literally Blue Bear!

549
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,010
Okay, so...

550
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,070
Um...

551
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,150
So... basically...

552
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,110
There was this... there was these stores going around.

553
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,470
I don't know if they're still... I don't think they're popular anymore.

554
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,370
I honestly don't think they're popular anymore.

555
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:25,970
Um...

556
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,110
In NA.

557
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:31,350
I knew they were like... they were super fucking popular back then when I was growing up.

558
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:34,210
But I think the company was called like Morning Glory.

559
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:41,150
And um... I used to... like my mom used to buy me a lot of like...

560
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,150
Um... like the mascot characters.

561
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:44,810
From... um...

562
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:47,990
From the... the comp... like from the store.

563
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:51,970
Uh... and I used to be like obsessed with Morning Glory.

564
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,070
There was this other one.

565
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,710
I saw someone... like I retweeted it too.

566
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:55,050
The R.

567
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:56,490
There's like the Korean bunny.

568
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,370
I'm trying to remember the Korean bunny.

569
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:58,890
Like...

570
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,010
Uh...

571
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:04,410
Like he's like... not... not... I'm not talking about Molang.

572
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:08,050
I'm talking about the... the... the OG Korean bunny.

573
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,210
Hehehehehehehehehehehehe.

574
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,230
Does anyone remember?

575
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,130
I retweeted the... someone... you remember?

576
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:13,890
The... someone artwork of it.

577
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:14,570
Like a parody.

578
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:15,670
The... Oh... No.

579
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,230
Not Molang.

580
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,550
That's like... that's like current Korean bunny.

581
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,770
But there was like the OG Hehehehehehehehe.

582
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,090
Is it Mashi?

583
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,410
Oh yes!

584
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:25,370
Yes!

585
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,570
It's Mashimato!

586
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:27,190
Okay!

587
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:31,650
I was fucking obsessed with uh...

588
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,970
Mashimato and a blue bear.

589
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:37,250
Hehehehehehehehehehehehe.

590
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:40,010
That's the... That was the original.

591
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,510
It's the original Korean bunny.

592
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:48,210
Now everybody knows about Mulan, but Mashimaro was the OG.

593
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,930
The OG Korean bunny.

594
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,250
Thank you for the akasupa.

595
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,470
Thank you, thank you.

596
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:04,290
Since you're a person who sleeps 17 out of 24 hours, I need advice on how to sleep quickly when my brain doesn't want to stop.

597
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:04,970
Thank you.

598
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,950
Okay, thank you for the akasupa.

599
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:07,670
Thank you, thank you.

600
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,270
Straight up, put white noise.

601
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,770
This is how I fall asleep.

602
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,330
I just put white noise of any YouTube video.

603
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:19,470
Usually the best ones are like podcasts or like someone, you know, it's just non-stop yapping.

604
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,770
So I'll just like...

605
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:27,030
Just play like any YouTube video or like Twitch streams or anything.

606
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:28,690
You can do music as well.

607
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:31,070
Music doesn't work as well for me when I sleep.

608
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:35,370
So I just put like podcasts or like commentary videos.

609
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:39,390
Or I used to sleep to Apex streams back then.

610
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:42,990
Now I just put on like random long videos.

611
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,370
It has to be super long too.

612
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:47,010
Like maybe like 20 plus minutes.

613
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,890
I choose a video between 20 plus to an hour.

614
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,910
So like, you know, if I...

615
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,970
Wake up, the video will still be going.

616
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:58,990
And it really helps a lot with falling asleep.

617
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,330
And like I can't really...

618
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:04,590
And also like when you're putting these videos, they're talking a lot too.

619
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:05,930
They're talking a lot.

620
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:09,670
So like your brain doesn't think about like, you know, anything else in your thoughts.

621
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,630
You're just thinking about like you're just...

622
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,710
Your brain is just focused on the white noise that's playing around.

623
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,310
That's playing on your phone.

624
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:21,910
And honestly, like I have no idea what any of the videos talk about.

625
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:30,290
Like I have zero memory of any of the videos that play when I go to sleep.

626
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,690
It just like my brain just deletes all of that information afterwards.

627
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:42,490
But that's basically how it helps me go to sleep too.

628
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:48,050
But yeah, anyway, as I was saying, the old...

629
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:50,190
Before Sanrio, I...

630
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:53,970
My mom would buy me a lot of those like from the Morning Glory company.

631
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,190
Like the stores.

632
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:59,530
There used to be so many of the stores where I used to live.

633
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:02,590
And I would have like...

634
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,670
I don't think they're like as popular anymore.

635
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:08,070
I think they got replaced by a lot like similar stores.

636
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,790
But it's not Morning Glory anymore.

637
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,970
But I used to have like a lot of stationery.

638
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,730
A lot of like pencils.

639
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,290
Oh, you know like those lead pencils?

640
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:16,650
Where...

641
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,630
Oh my gosh.

642
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:18,310
Okay.

643
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,950
Okay, it's like...

644
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,570
I don't know if people still use these.

645
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:25,670
But as a kid, instead of lead pencils, it's like...

646
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,790
They're like little capsules.

647
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,350
Wait, I'm gonna get a picture.

648
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,450
I can show the picture on screen.

649
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,870
I wish I know what it was called.

650
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,490
But they're like little capsules.

651
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,790
And then you...

652
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,550
After you finish using them, you plug it out.

653
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,050
And then you put it on the top.

654
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:45,190
And then like, you know, another capsule will come out.

655
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,130
Does anyone remember those?

656
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,470
They used to be so popular for children.

657
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,490
Yeah, they used to...

658
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,890
Yeah, they used to be like incredibly popular for kids.

659
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:58,730
I don't think people use them anymore because they realized it was so...

660
00:25:58,730 --> 00:25:59,810
What's the word?

661
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:03,290
It was very environmentally unfriendly.

662
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:09,790
It was incredibly wasteful.

663
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,410
I'm pretty sure.

664
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,330
I'm pretty sure.

665
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:17,110
Because like, you know, after you finish using them, you know...

666
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,870
You can't do anything anymore.

667
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,010
So I'm pretty sure.

668
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,610
Also a choking hazard.

669
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:23,330
You're right.

670
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,110
It was most definitely a choking hazard.

671
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,950
But kids loved it.

672
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:37,270
But I honestly, I don't know what it was called.

673
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,390
I just remember I would...

674
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:38,990
There was like...

675
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:43,550
I used to use those because like that's what my mom bought for me before I went...

676
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,630
Before I started using lead pencil.

677
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,090
They were like...

678
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:47,950
They were pretty fun though.

679
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,310
More balls.

680
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,290
Thank you for the super chat.

681
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:51,630
Thank you.

682
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,870
I drew the artwork of you.

683
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,610
Of you.

684
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:55,530
Mashimoto version.

685
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,630
I didn't know you would know this.

686
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:57,130
Of course.

687
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:57,430
Yeah.

688
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,470
Yeah, of course.

689
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:00,290
KR bunny.

690
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:01,790
And also thank you so much for the retweet.

691
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:02,550
Thank you for the super chat.

692
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:02,870
Thank you.

693
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:03,530
Thank you.

694
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:04,670
Of course.

695
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,290
It's the OG Korean bunny.

696
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:11,210
Yeah, it's like a little dart Lego.

697
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:11,650
Yeah.

698
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:11,930
Yeah.

699
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:16,370
I'm pretty sure like because it was definitely like a choking hazard.

700
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:20,990
And also not very good for the environment that it definitely quickly died out like...

701
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:30,250
It's definitely definitely people realize like oh that is not very safe for kids.

702
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,490
We should we should stop.

703
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:37,390
We should stop making them stacking up pencils.

704
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:38,950
Okay, let me see.

705
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:39,610
Yes.

706
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:40,930
Yes.

707
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,390
That's what they are.

708
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:44,130
And then I would...

709
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:44,610
Okay, wait.

710
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:45,850
Blue bear.

711
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,490
Is that the blue bear version?

712
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:48,130
No!

713
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,810
Where the fuck is that blue bear?

714
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,350
Okay, blue bear.

715
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:55,950
Blue bear stationary.

716
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:57,970
Okay, let's see.

717
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:58,950
Oh my gosh.

718
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,930
Oh, I'm like looking at all the...

719
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,110
Oh my I had like so many of these things.

720
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,310
Oh, I had this before.

721
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:07,870
Wait, no, that's bootleg.

722
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:08,390
Nevermind.

723
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,370
I did not have this before.

724
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:09,990
I...

725
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,850
Wait, did I?

726
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,990
Okay, I had this but it was the not bootleg version.

727
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:15,690
Like...

728
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:23,530
Also, Pat said thank you for the 20 gifted chips.

729
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,150
Thank you.

730
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:24,730
Thank you.

731
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:25,590
Oh my gosh.

732
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:26,850
My mom would like...

733
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:28,210
I remember my mom would buy...

734
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,870
Would buy these types of...

735
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:38,430
Would buy like these types of stationery for me because it was like, you know, a fucking bargain.

736
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:44,130
Like all in one special, you know, like that type of deal.

737
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:49,190
But, also, like the non...

738
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:51,070
The non-bootleg version.

739
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,310
Just so you know.

740
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,250
Oh my gosh.

741
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,930
I'm looking at the morning...

742
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:04,870
Oh my gosh, I love how like the Morning Glory store just puts us in a model now.

743
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,910
Just it's just Sanrio products now.

744
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:08,850
No!

745
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,490
You have your own.

746
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:15,630
Morning Glory.

747
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,970
Why are you selling your own?

748
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,730
I'm so sad.

749
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:29,630
My childhood is getting absorbed by all the other monopolies.

750
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,270
Oh my god.

751
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,670
My childhood.

752
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:40,430
They're getting absorbed by all the other monopolies.

753
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:43,750
Oh, back in my day.

754
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:54,670
Fox, I don't know if you guys know this, but back in my day, Fox channel, like, the Fox channel used to be its own network.

755
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,070
I know.

756
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,590
It's so crazy.

757
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,810
I know it's insane.

758
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:03,450
You mean Disney didn't own like 80% of the media?

759
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,710
No fucking way!

760
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:12,210
Prop, thank you for the super chat.

761
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:12,630
Thank you.

762
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,310
Thank you.

763
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:13,730
Thank you.

764
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,990
Goodnight, Doki Bird.

765
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:19,690
Sleep tight and plenty and keep on smiling for next day and next day and next and so on.

766
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,010
T, thank you for the super chat.

767
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:21,390
Thank you.

768
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:21,990
Thank you.

769
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:29,330
I would not be surprised if Disney just absorbs like 10% more of the media around us.

770
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,230
What else is next?

771
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,170
Okay, ABC is also Disney.

772
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:33,450
Um...

773
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:35,750
Fox is now Disney.

774
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,710
HBO... I don't know.

775
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:38,250
I don't know if...

776
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,350
I don't know if Disney can actually buy HBO.

777
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,650
Who owns HBO?

778
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:45,210
Anyway, who owns HBO?

779
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,390
Let's see.

780
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,010
Who owns...

781
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,370
Who owns HBO?

782
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,070
HBO.

783
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,710
Casey Bloys.

784
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,550
Who are you?

785
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:57,630
Oh yeah, Warner.

786
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:58,570
Honestly?

787
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:01,650
With the rate Warner Brothers is going?

788
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:04,690
Alright.

789
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:05,490
Alright.

790
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:08,070
Somebody quote me on this in 10 years.

791
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:12,630
I bet you in 10 years, Disney is gonna buy Warner Brothers.

792
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:14,870
I bet you guys.

793
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,190
This is what's gonna happen.

794
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:20,650
In 10 years, Disney is gonna own Warner Brothers because I fucking...

795
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:21,570
I don't care.

796
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:24,710
I don't care if this guy watches me because like...

797
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:32,430
And if he does, I say that's an honor that the Warner Brothers CEO watches this stupid dumb VTuber.

798
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:39,710
But like I fucking hate the Warner Brothers CEO.

799
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,610
He's like the worst CEO that we've ever seen.

800
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,670
He's like the worst CEO that we've ever had for Warner Brothers.

801
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:50,770
And with the rate he's going, like all he fucking cares about is like meeting the...

802
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:54,030
Like finance... like meeting the fucking financial line.

803
00:31:54,270 --> 00:32:03,510
And I bet you... I bet you I would not be surprised if Disney offers that guy like a lot of fucking money.

804
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:04,650
He'd take it.

805
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:05,490
100%.

806
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,090
He does anything for tax breaks.

807
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:10,590
I bet you he would fucking take... he would take the money.

808
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:11,670
Anyway.

809
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:15,230
Please don't copy strike me on any games I play from Warner Brothers.

810
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,070
Please.

811
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:22,770
Please.

812
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:25,990
I really... I really like the Batman games.

813
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:29,290
Please let me continue playing the Batman games.

814
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,130
I would really appreciate it.

815
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:35,650
Please.

816
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:38,610
You'll get nothing from copyright striking me.

817
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:41,610
Like I get like... like it'll be like pennies.

818
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:41,930
Please.

819
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:42,770
Don't tell...

820
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:43,550
Oh my gosh.

821
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,350
By the way, I got hit by limited ads.

822
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:47,710
I got hit by limited ads on my collab.

823
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,490
I must have swore... did I swear in the beginning?

824
00:32:54,450 --> 00:33:00,630
Someone pull up my collab stream right now and tell me how long did it take to hear the first swear word.

825
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:06,150
I submitted an appeal already.

826
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:12,050
But like somebody pull up the stream right now and tell me how long it took for me to swear.

827
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,870
I need to... I need to find the sweet spot.

828
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:24,790
I need to figure out what is the sweet spot of like the amount of time I can like basically like...

829
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:31,950
So you know it's like oh you cannot swear in the first like X amount of minutes.

830
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,670
And then I need to figure out... I need to tie myself.

831
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,810
I need to wait until like 10 to 15 minutes until I swear.

832
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,270
First 10 minutes.

833
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:39,950
Okay guys.

834
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:42,710
Maybe I play the intro for 10 minutes.

835
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:43,750
I'm getting straight.

836
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:54,410
Maybe I just... I just play the intro for...

837
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:56,990
And was that 3 minutes and 50?

838
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:58,230
Bro!

839
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:04,190
We didn't even last one... like less... we didn't even last 2 minutes.

840
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,550
Oh my god.

841
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:11,570
We didn't even last 2 minutes before we went into swear mode.

842
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,110
That's so fucked up.

843
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:13,410
That's so fucked up man.

844
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:16,270
That's so fucked up.

845
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:18,970
Peter, thank you for the super chat.

846
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:19,350
Thank you.

847
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:19,890
Thank you.

848
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:21,930
Current Warner Bros.

849
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,350
CEO is speed running bankruptcy.

850
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,330
Thank you for the super chat.

851
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:24,730
Thank you.

852
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:25,270
Thank you.

853
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,610
Gladstone, thank you for the super chat.

854
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:28,970
Thank you.

855
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:29,630
Thank you.

856
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:32,530
Just gotta learn to say frick instead of the other F word.

857
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:35,190
Okay I swear to god if I get like limited for the stream...

858
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,810
Guys, did I swear?

859
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:37,490
I don't remember.

860
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,310
Did I swear in the first 10 minutes?

861
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:42,090
Today.

862
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:42,350
Today.

863
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,730
For this stream right now.

864
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:46,090
Did I swear in the first 10 minutes?

865
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,370
Cause I don't fucking know.

866
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:54,030
Yes but it's already after 10 minutes.

867
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:55,570
I can... it's already like...

868
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,130
It's already like...

869
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:57,850
What?

870
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:58,350
Oh my gosh.

871
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,110
How long have I been streaming?

872
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,530
It's already been like 30... 38 minutes?

873
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:02,850
Has it already... oh my gosh.

874
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:04,590
I fucking don't stop yapping.

875
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:07,570
It's already been like 38 minutes and like...

876
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:09,970
Time flies by so fast.

877
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:11,250
Um...

878
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:12,550
But yeah.

879
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,670
I learned that...

880
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,650
I don't... it must be a new rule.

881
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:18,530
Cause I was... I would never get hit in the past.

882
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:20,790
And I like... swore so much.

883
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:24,290
I used to never get hit by the limited ad shit.

884
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:25,790
Um... in the past.

885
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:28,590
So they must have recently changed the algorithm or something.

886
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:29,830
I just hate that.

887
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,970
I hate it because obviously I don't get the ad revenue.

888
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:38,070
Um... I don't get the ad revenue for like the first couple of hours.

889
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,830
Uh... because they hit me with the limited ads.

890
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,920
And because of that...

891
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,410
Um... because...

892
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:46,150
And like people usually watch the VOD.

893
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:46,930
You know like...

894
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:49,330
After the stream ends, people would watch the VOD instantly.

895
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,130
So it's like...

896
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:50,690
Nooooo!

897
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:52,430
YouTube!

898
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,010
YouTube!

899
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:59,670
Yeah the most important hours!

900
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:01,790
Nooooo!

901
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:07,910
Um...

902
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:09,120
But...

903
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:10,450
It was there before...

904
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:11,190
No that's the thing!

905
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:13,270
Um... on my previous channel...

906
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:16,010
I rarely if ever get hit with limited ads.

907
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:18,430
It only happens when...

908
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:21,290
Uh... I usually only get strike by like music stuff.

909
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,330
And it was...

910
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:23,750
I would never get strike for...

911
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:24,510
This is like...

912
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,430
It's been the first time.

913
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:28,190
It's been the first time I've been like getting strike for profanity.

914
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,030
Uh... which has been very surprising.

915
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:34,330
D2H!

916
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:35,950
Thank you for the AKASUPA!

917
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:36,670
Thank you!

918
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,850
Honestly I could figure out what to say.

919
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:42,950
It was bouncing between a genuine question or a DN joke.

920
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,670
But I can't do that to my Kamiyoshi.

921
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,570
Just answer me this.

922
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,850
Any thoughts on playing Metro?

923
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:49,090
Thank you for the AKASUPA!

924
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:49,650
Thank you!

925
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,270
Thank you!

926
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:51,830
Um...

927
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:54,170
Depends on like which Metro series.

928
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,030
Uh...

929
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:58,110
I might try Metro at a later time.

930
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:00,350
I think like I stopped because like...

931
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:00,870
I think I...

932
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,010
I don't know why I stopped.

933
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,530
I think it's because like there was too long...

934
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:05,350
It was too long of a break in between.

935
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,330
So like I just stopped playing it.

936
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:08,390
Um...

937
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,290
Um...

938
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:12,690
I think I'm gonna try and find a Metro game.

939
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:17,910
I might start on a Metro game that was considered more the popular one.

940
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,690
Because I don't think I actually...

941
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:22,150
I don't think I like enjoyed the one I played.

942
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:24,450
I don't even remember which one I played on stream.

943
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:25,330
I actually...

944
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,430
I actually don't remember!

945
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,690
I don't think I enjoyed that one.

946
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:31,570
Um...

947
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,070
As much as I would have liked it.

948
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,230
I mean as much as...

949
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:34,390
I...

950
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:37,290
I don't think I enjoyed it as much as I would have liked.

951
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,410
So I feel like I should try to find...

952
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:41,070
I should try and start one that I...

953
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,790
That was considered like...

954
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:44,330
Um...

955
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,410
Like universal appeal.

956
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:46,490
A lot of...

957
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:48,590
A lot of people are asking me because I talked about Fallout.

958
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:49,470
Um...

959
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,370
It's really good.

960
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,810
I highly recommend checking out the Fall...

961
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:53,230
I feel...

962
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:53,730
Fallout show.

963
00:37:53,870 --> 00:38:01,990
I feel like we're in a generation where like gamers are now making the shows for like video game adaptations.

964
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:03,650
Um...

965
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:09,390
And I feel like we're at a point where we have people who actually play games.

966
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:13,690
And they play video games making good adaptations of...

967
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:14,530
Of...

968
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:14,670
Video...

969
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,070
Like...

970
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:15,610
Of like...

971
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:16,070
Um...

972
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,590
Like of video games.

973
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:18,630
And...

974
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,570
Um...

975
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:21,630
Okay.

976
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:22,890
The Halo series.

977
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:23,530
Okay.

978
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:32,090
We don't mention the Halo series because the Halo series was literally made by a group of creators who don't even...

979
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:35,270
Who don't even like play video games.

980
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,830
They literally don't care about Halo.

981
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:39,370
The writers basically...

982
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,310
Never played Halo.

983
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,690
The only exception...

984
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:48,990
The only... I think the only exception for that was like Last of Us.

985
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:51,990
Because the creator... I think the creators of Last of Us...

986
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:54,790
The creators of Last of Us actually played the game.

987
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:57,550
But they told the actors to not play the game.

988
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:04,730
But the... the creators and the writers and the producers, they know the story of Last of Us and they actually play the game.

989
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:05,450
But...

990
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:08,710
They told the actors, they're like, no, do not play the game.

991
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:12,530
We want you to act without any of the knowledge of what's going on in the video game.

992
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:14,790
And...

993
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:18,690
But they were still pretty faithful to the Last of Us game.

994
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,830
But yeah, I think like the Halo...

995
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:26,590
The people in Halo, they did not know what the fuck was going on.

996
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:27,590
Twisted meta?

997
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,670
Okay, twisted meta?

998
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:30,750
Like...

999
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:34,390
There's no...

1000
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,230
Not gonna lie...

1001
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:38,470
I don't... I don't think the video game...

1002
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,730
Has much lore.

1003
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:42,250
Like...

1004
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:42,950
It was...

1005
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:48,210
The game was just about like people in cars, like beating each other up in cars.

1006
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:49,590
So like...

1007
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:56,310
I... I feel like the game itself didn't really have a lot of lore to build off of.

1008
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:57,370
So...

1009
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:00,010
I was so surprised that...

1010
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,150
I was...

1011
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:07,430
I was so surprised that the show...

1012
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,330
Actually...

1013
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:08,950
Like...

1014
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,010
Did something.

1015
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:17,050
What do you mean as what?

1016
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:17,850
What's the lore?

1017
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:19,570
What's the lore?

1018
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:20,810
I feel like...

1019
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:21,390
Okay...

1020
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,110
Like...

1021
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,490
Like I meant like more...

1022
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:28,090
I've only played one twisted meta game.

1023
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,870
But also I was like super fucking young.

1024
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:34,030
And I feel like...

1025
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,150
I feel like...

1026
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,450
The people...

1027
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:38,550
Like okay, if you look at the other games...

1028
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:40,310
The really successful adaptations...

1029
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:41,730
A lot of the game...

1030
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,990
A lot of them had like...

1031
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:46,570
A lot of people like know about the lore of these games.

1032
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:48,050
Like Fallout has an extensive lore.

1033
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:51,310
Last of Us has an extensive lore and story.

1034
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,510
But like...

1035
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:54,970
Twisted Metal...

1036
00:40:55,690 --> 00:41:03,030
All I remember about Twisted Metal was that clown and then cars.

1037
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:04,550
And then cars.

1038
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:11,430
And then they made a whole entire story.

1039
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,990
Based off of like...

1040
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:13,690
A car.

1041
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,190
I was like okay.

1042
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,690
But yeah, anyway.

1043
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:26,390
I highly recommend...

1044
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:29,170
Like I feel like a meme about like oh video game...

1045
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:32,990
Video game adaptations is like almost non-existent anymore.

1046
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,110
Because there's been more...

1047
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:38,950
There's been more like home runs than there is duds in general.

1048
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:40,870
And I honestly feel like...

1049
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:48,450
I honestly feel like we're at a time where people actually know how to make good video game adaptations.

1050
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:51,670
Because they're running out of sequels to do.

1051
00:41:56,410 --> 00:42:01,890
People are tired of fucking superhero films.

1052
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:05,750
And people are tired of superhero films.

1053
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:08,890
And people are tired of sequels.

1054
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:12,730
Video game adaptations is the next niche.

1055
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:17,550
We're at an era of video game adaptations now.

1056
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:19,410
Honestly, it's true.

1057
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:20,530
It's true.

1058
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,350
It's not about superheroes anymore.

1059
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:25,590
It's all about video game adaptations now.

1060
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:29,750
We're at the new stage.

1061
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:30,890
A new era.

1062
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:33,430
What's that word called?

1063
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:37,410
You know, like the next peak of cinema?

1064
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:38,870
Fuck, what's that word?

1065
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:39,490
What's that word called?

1066
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,130
I forgot what it's called.

1067
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:42,930
My English is deteriorating.

1068
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:46,510
The next mainstream thing.

1069
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:49,210
It's the next mainstream act!

1070
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:52,110
And we're getting Warhammer 2!

1071
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,250
The next era!

1072
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:55,370
We have the next meta.

1073
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:56,810
Yes, it's the next meta!

1074
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:59,410
No more superhero meta!

1075
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:02,430
We're in the video game meta now!

1076
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:05,570
I think it's also because we have the graphics.

1077
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:08,330
We have the ability to do CGI now.

1078
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:10,430
Of like actual video game CGI.

1079
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:13,830
So, I mean, okay, here are like...

1080
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:14,590
Alright, the good ones.

1081
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:15,570
There was Fallout.

1082
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:16,870
There's Last of Us.

1083
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,370
The Witcher.

1084
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:20,730
Until like they fired half the writing crew.

1085
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:24,590
The writers.

1086
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:27,130
Yeah, until they fired some of the writing crew.

1087
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,410
And also Henry Cavill.

1088
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:30,730
Arcane.

1089
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:32,730
What else?

1090
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:33,930
There's so many.

1091
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:35,730
Sonic was pretty good too.

1092
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:36,810
Sonic.

1093
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:37,530
Mario.

1094
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:40,610
Umm...

1095
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:43,110
The Witcher was good until it wasn't!

1096
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:44,830
Alright guys?

1097
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:47,910
The Witcher was good until it wasn't!

1098
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:52,430
You can't blame them!

1099
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:53,110
Cyberpunk.

1100
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:54,770
Umm...

1101
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:57,610
There's been so many like actual decent ones.

1102
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:00,010
Okay, Detective Pikachu was pretty fun.

1103
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:00,330
Yes.

1104
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:02,130
Detective Pikachu was pretty fun.

1105
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:04,030
Only because of Ryan Reynolds.

1106
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:06,790
If it wasn't for Ryan Reynolds, I think the movie would have been...

1107
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:08,190
Pretty shit.

1108
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:09,990
Not gonna lie.

1109
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:11,390
Not gonna lie.

1110
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:18,050
Ryan Reynolds is the only reason why Detective Pikachu was as good as it is.

1111
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:22,150
Because if you take Ryan Reynolds out, the other actors were so bad.

1112
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:25,470
No offense to the other actors.

1113
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:29,070
But they were not as memorable or as good.

1114
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:31,330
Umm...

1115
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:32,910
Deadpool.

1116
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:35,550
Thank you for the super chat.

1117
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:35,910
Thank you.

1118
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:36,370
Thank you.

1119
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:36,770
We're currently at the end of the video.

1120
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:37,670
Finally in the Dune era.

1121
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:41,050
But next year, video games will rise like the...

1122
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:41,410
What?

1123
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:42,010
What?

1124
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:43,570
Thank you for the super chat.

1125
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:43,970
Thank you.

1126
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:44,570
Thank you.

1127
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:45,190
Who's that?

1128
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:49,110
I'm scared of saying their name because I don't know who they are.

1129
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:50,910
Oh, it's from Dune!

1130
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:51,310
Okay.

1131
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:52,130
I was like...

1132
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:52,850
I'm scared.

1133
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:54,830
I don't want to get baited into saying something.

1134
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:00,310
Yeah, I haven't seen Dune by the way, guys.

1135
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:01,950
I haven't seen Dune.

1136
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:04,090
I was just worried.

1137
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:06,070
Worried I'm getting baited.

1138
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:06,750
I was just worried.

1139
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:09,990
Thank you for the super chat.

1140
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:10,410
Thank you.

1141
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:11,030
Thank you.

1142
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:12,810
Leah, thank you for the super chat.

1143
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:13,150
Thank you.

1144
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:13,690
Thank you.

1145
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:14,170
Thank you.

1146
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:16,410
Thank you for the super chat.

1147
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:16,750
Thank you.

1148
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:17,250
Thank you.

1149
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:20,090
I haven't watched Dune yet.

1150
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:22,810
The only thing I know about Dune is that the...

1151
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:25,950
The only thing I know about Dune is the...

1152
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:28,390
It's the movie theater...

1153
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:31,630
Cup holder for Dune.

1154
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:32,870
Have you guys seen it?

1155
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:34,150
Oh!

1156
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:38,490
Have you guys seen that?

1157
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:39,770
Oh, is it a popcorn bucket?

1158
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:41,870
Have you guys seen it?

1159
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:42,630
Don't worry guys.

1160
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:44,050
I can show this on stream.

1161
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,210
I think...

1162
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:53,930
Because it's a popcorn bucket!

1163
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:55,910
Guys, look at this.

1164
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:01,270
This is the only thing I know about...

1165
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:05,890
Dude... the fucking... the fucking... it's a popcorn bucket!

1166
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,150
You stick your hand in it!

1167
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:08,110
Your hand!

1168
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,170
You stick your hand!

1169
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:13,410
The only appendage that should go in there to grab the popcorn.

1170
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:16,710
And then eat the popcorn.

1171
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:19,570
Oh yeah, that's the only thing I know about Dune.

1172
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:20,290
It's just this.

1173
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:22,830
That's literally my only knowledge.

1174
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:30,990
But...

1175
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:35,090
But yeah, that's like...

1176
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:36,710
Everything I know.

1177
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:39,050
Anyway, as I was saying, I feel like...

1178
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:42,030
It's gonna be interesting what...

1179
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:44,290
What the new... what is it?

1180
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:47,210
The Warhammer movie is gonna be because it's gonna start... it's gonna be like...

1181
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:51,270
Oh, is it gonna continue the trend of actual decent video game adaptations?

1182
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:56,830
But oh also, also, also I was gonna say... yeah, but yeah, check out...

1183
00:46:58,310 --> 00:47:00,230
You gotta... you guys gotta check out Fallout.

1184
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:03,370
I think if you really like the games... if you really like the games...

1185
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:07,550
if you really like the lore, if you just like Fallout in general... even if you don't like Fallout.

1186
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:10,090
I think it's like really interesting to watch.

1187
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:19,910
It's actually really decent I'm only on the first two episodes The first episode was so good That I had to click next.

1188
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:41,710
Like I was like, I want to watch the next one But you guys can get tell me all the spoilers because I already read a lot already... guys I already read the wiki I already read the wiki I got into the rabbit hole of... you know how like when you click one article and then you click on the next article and then you click on the next article?

1189
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:46,990
So like, I was like, oh man, Vault 33, Vault 32, and Vault 31.

1190
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:48,010
That's so interesting.

1191
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:54,310
Because like, I love the lore behind Fallout because I thought it was like... it's just very interesting to read.

1192
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:58,990
And like, if you guys don't know the lore of like the Vaults, each Vault...

1193
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:05,470
Each Vault has like a different experiment going on.

1194
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:06,550
So I was curious.

1195
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:10,470
I was like, oh, what is this Vault's like science experiment?

1196
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:14,490
So they'll like do like a social experiment with each Vault.

1197
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:15,790
Like with each Vault.

1198
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:18,990
And the Vault is where like they put all the people in there and stuff like that.

1199
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:23,890
And then I was like, oh, okay, I want to know what the Vault... what their social experiment is.

1200
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:26,850
Or like the science experiment is going on in that Vault.

1201
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:28,290
Like in the Vault we're looking at.

1202
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:28,950
And then so...

1203
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:32,310
I got into a whole fucking rabbit hole of...

1204
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:35,210
Of the show.

1205
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:39,010
So I sort of know how it... I sort of know how the show ends.

1206
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:41,050
But like I'm on episode two.

1207
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:41,950
Um...

1208
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:46,930
There's like... so like if you guys don't know about the Vault lore.

1209
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:52,150
There's one Vault where it's just filled with clones named Gary.

1210
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:54,690
And all they say is Gary.

1211
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:55,610
Uh...

1212
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,710
And... and um...

1213
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:01,830
There's another Vault.

1214
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:03,090
There's a... there...

1215
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:06,250
Oh, I know you guys are curious about this Vault.

1216
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:08,710
You must be like, what's in Vault 69?

1217
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:14,570
It's... they basically in Vault 69 is one guy and then all women.

1218
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:21,600
That's what's in Vault 69.

1219
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,940
Real... this is actually real lore by the way.

1220
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,200
I'm not making this shit up.

1221
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,540
Like that's actually what's in Vault 69.

1222
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:30,840
Um...

1223
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:35,980
They knew, of course, they know every fucking gamer is a ten-year-old inside.

1224
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:36,480
Okay.

1225
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:37,300
No, not ten-year-old.

1226
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:38,240
That's the wrong age.

1227
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:39,860
Puberty 14.

1228
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:40,440
Okay.

1229
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:46,780
Every gamer game developer is a fourteen-year-old.

1230
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,100
Has a fourteen-year-old inside.

1231
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,120
Sorry.

1232
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:55,640
I just think about what age do people hit puberty.

1233
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,180
And I was like ten is not the right age for puberty.

1234
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:57,640
Right age!

1235
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,500
14 is much better!

1236
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:08,140
The inner 14 year old.

1237
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:13,700
But yes, and then I think those were the most ridiculous ones for me.

1238
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:15,720
I think there was one where...

1239
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,680
I can't remember, there was like another vault...

1240
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:20,420
where...

1241
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:22,780
I can't remember.

1242
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,780
There was like one vault where it was like one guy...

1243
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,180
and then it's all puppets.

1244
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,600
So they want to see like how insane...

1245
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:33,220
like will they be able to function as a human being...

1246
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:36,380
with no socialization except for the puppets?

1247
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,640
And obviously the answer is no.

1248
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:42,580
Yeah, no.

1249
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,260
That person was not okay.

1250
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,280
The puppet man.

1251
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:48,540
Yeah, the puppet man.

1252
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:55,480
Wait, did Penny Arcade actually write that one?

1253
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:56,980
Wait, Penny Arcade?

1254
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,480
Oh my God, that's a name I...

1255
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,840
I fucking...

1256
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,960
That's a name I haven't heard in so long.

1257
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,100
Are they still like...

1258
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:06,640
Is it still alive?

1259
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:07,860
How?

1260
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,180
Holy shit!

1261
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:16,940
The creators of Penny Arcade is almost in his 50s.

1262
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:18,940
That's... Oh my God!

1263
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:23,820
I think a lot of people feel so old right now.

1264
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,240
I think a lot of people feel so old right now.

1265
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:27,240
Oh my God!

1266
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:31,700
He's in his... He's almost in his 50s.

1267
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,160
They're 46 and 48.

1268
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,880
They were like the OG gamer comics.

1269
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:45,460
You're better off being a ghoul than him most of this world.

1270
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:48,180
Guys, okay.

1271
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:49,840
We'll see other...

1272
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,240
Oh God, Cyanide and Happiness.

1273
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:53,080
Bro, I'm so sad.

1274
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:54,080
Cyanide and Happiness.

1275
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,760
They still make really good games.

1276
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:56,340
They still make really good content.

1277
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:00,460
But because they're like super old now, people don't watch Cyanide and Happiness anymore.

1278
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:01,600
I still like...

1279
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,020
I still like watch it ever so often.

1280
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:08,500
Like there'd be like a gaps in between before I like watch Cyanide and Happiness again.

1281
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:14,400
And the creators of Cyanide and Happiness, he's 30...

1282
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,360
Okay, not as old.

1283
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:16,720
Not as old.

1284
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,320
So not as old.

1285
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,020
36.

1286
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:20,320
That's pretty good.

1287
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,940
36 to 39.

1288
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:25,240
That's decent.

1289
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,160
That's pretty good.

1290
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:27,540
It makes you feel less old now.

1291
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,040
Bro, I used to love Cyanide.

1292
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,000
I actually owned...

1293
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:40,180
I owned several hard copy books of Cyanide and Happiness.

1294
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,920
I have like...

1295
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,280
I actually...

1296
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:47,400
I kickstarted a bunch of their game like board games as well.

1297
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,500
Because like I honestly I just love their content.

1298
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,080
And don't say 30.

1299
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:53,960
Look, 36 is pretty decent.

1300
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,380
Not as bad as 48.

1301
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:59,380
I can't believe Penny Arcade.

1302
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:02,040
Like the creators are like 48.

1303
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,180
Oh my god.

1304
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,240
They're like the OGs too.

1305
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,300
Oh my god.

1306
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:07,860
Okay.

1307
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,280
Um...

1308
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,620
Oh my god.

1309
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,280
This is like blast from the past.

1310
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:20,380
But does anyone remember that fucking Cartoon Network comic of...

1311
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:21,280
Oh my god.

1312
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,040
Oh my god.

1313
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:23,240
Oh my god.

1314
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:23,940
Oh my god.

1315
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,900
Does anyone remember?

1316
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:27,320
Because it was like...

1317
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:30,500
Okay, these were the comics that people used to read back then.

1318
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:31,680
It was...

1319
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:32,760
Um...

1320
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,100
It was Penny Arcade.

1321
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,880
I think Grim Tales.

1322
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:40,480
I think that was how it was like Cartoon Network.

1323
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:43,420
But what if they're like super fucking edgy?

1324
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:51,400
And it was like super fucking edgy.

1325
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:53,380
So it was like people would read...

1326
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:54,660
Um...

1327
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:56,800
Um...

1328
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,220
Penny Arcade.

1329
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:58,960
Grim Tales.

1330
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:00,300
Uh...

1331
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:01,460
Cyanide and Happiness.

1332
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:03,360
Uh...

1333
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,260
And...

1334
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:05,260
Snafu.

1335
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:06,300
Yeah, Snafu comics.

1336
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:07,120
And...

1337
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,060
Uh...

1338
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:08,960
What else?

1339
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:09,640
There was like...

1340
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,260
Oh my god.

1341
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:10,980
Fusion Fall.

1342
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:12,900
I remember Fusion Fall.

1343
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:15,240
I never got a chance to play Fusion Fall.

1344
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,500
I don't know why.

1345
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:20,980
I think I was just too stupid on the internet to know how to play Fusion Fall.

1346
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:22,400
Mega Tokyo.

1347
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:23,360
Bro, Mega Tokyo.

1348
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:23,860
Mega Tokyo?

1349
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:25,700
Can I say that?

1350
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:26,200
It was a scam.

1351
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:31,420
They don't...

1352
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:32,160
Do they still exist?

1353
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:33,580
Oh, they do.

1354
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:33,980
Okay.

1355
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,360
Wait, not Mega Tokyo.

1356
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,040
What was it?

1357
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:37,580
Not Mega Tokyo.

1358
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:38,240
What was it?

1359
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,200
The Tokyo Pop?

1360
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:39,680
No.

1361
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:40,700
Not Mega Tokyo.

1362
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:41,860
What was it?

1363
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:42,360
Is it Tokyo?

1364
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:43,860
It was like some...

1365
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:45,140
Well, not...

1366
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:45,680
Was it...

1367
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:46,640
Uh...

1368
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:47,540
The publication.

1369
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:49,420
Was it not?

1370
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:49,900
It was not...

1371
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:50,780
I'm not talking about Mega Tokyo.

1372
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:51,420
It was...

1373
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,080
It was like a book publication.

1374
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:58,240
The comic books before, who were like...

1375
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:01,000
I'm not talking about Mega Tokyo.

1376
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,120
I'm talking about like...

1377
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,280
Is it Tokyo Pop?

1378
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,500
Oh, yeah.

1379
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,860
I don't know if they are better now.

1380
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:12,480
But, like, I heard Tokyo Pop used to have like really bad illustrator contracts.

1381
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:13,460
I think...

1382
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:14,620
I don't know if they are better now.

1383
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,760
But like I remember there was several...

1384
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,020
Like the publisher.

1385
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:19,580
Yeah.

1386
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:20,180
The publisher.

1387
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:32,740
I remember back then the publisher had like really bad like contracts and everything for like artists and translators back then.

1388
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:37,100
Like people were making not twitlongers but...

1389
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,540
I guess Twitter?

1390
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:39,700
Sorry, not Twitter.

1391
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:42,560
Twitter was not a thing yet.

1392
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:50,240
So people were making like the DeviantArt and Tumblr equivalent of twitlongers about Tokyo Pop.

1393
00:55:56,020 --> 00:56:02,000
And then... and then yeah the angry bloggers.

1394
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:09,880
They live... there was like live journals and Tumblr posts and DeviantArt journal blog posts about Tokyo Pop.

1395
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:17,600
Because apparently they paid really little in terms of translations and it wasn't like super accurate.

1396
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:19,100
But the thing is...

1397
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:20,220
They had so much...

1398
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,880
They had so many licenses and I think at one point they went bankrupt.

1399
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:28,660
So like it took off like majority of the English...

1400
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:35,320
The English translations of Tokyo Pop mangas.

1401
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:41,680
So like majority of like... because like they own... they had... they almost had a monopoly for like manga.

1402
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:47,100
And I think they went bankrupt and at one point and they had to like...

1403
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:49,860
They had to like take down...

1404
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,060
They had to like take down like the majority of like you know they went bankrupt.

1405
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:56,740
So they had to... basically a lot of manga was like taken out because of it.

1406
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:59,020
And I... and apparently they're still around.

1407
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,580
So they must have got better.

1408
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,800
They must have got better.

1409
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,640
I remember people were like...

1410
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:08,860
Yeah.

1411
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,440
They almost killed the whole scene.

1412
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,100
Because they literally had the monopoly.

1413
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,940
They had the monopoly of manga.

1414
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:19,720
For like the NA side.

1415
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,300
Because like it was the only way to read like NA manga.

1416
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:24,000
Like English manga.

1417
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,180
And then it like... they almost went bankrupt.

1418
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:30,940
Oh my gosh.

1419
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,720
And then there was... there was... there was...

1420
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,360
Does anyone remember the...

1421
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:37,020
Okay.

1422
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,780
There was this like thing back then.

1423
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,560
Where it was like... I wish they bring it back man.

1424
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,340
The OC contest.

1425
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:45,460
Oh my god.

1426
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:46,420
So...

1427
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:49,140
I used to love Endling.

1428
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:50,460
Endling stuff.

1429
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:52,240
Ever after.

1430
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,660
Oh my god.

1431
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,320
I love reading his comics.

1432
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:57,600
And then he like... he stopped.

1433
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,120
Because I guess he got a real job.

1434
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,240
Silas, thank you for the five gift chips.

1435
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:05,740
Thank you.

1436
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:10,400
But back then there was like original character tournaments.

1437
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:12,400
And it was so fucking cool.

1438
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:13,960
Because...

1439
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:17,920
Because like...

1440
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:20,860
There was this thing where...

1441
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,820
People would make up these like tournaments and stuff.

1442
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:27,780
And then there was like a whole lore around it.

1443
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:31,180
There was like a whole lore and everything around it.

1444
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:33,840
And then it was like people would like...

1445
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,580
Enter with like original characters and stuff.

1446
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:38,900
And then there would be like battles.

1447
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:39,820
Yeah, OC battles.

1448
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:44,700
So like they'll draw comics, animations, stuff like that for like OC battles.

1449
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,120
And the most famous...

1450
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,720
The most famous one was...

1451
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:51,600
The Ever After tournament with Enling hosting it.

1452
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:52,600
And...

1453
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,580
Oh, with the climber.

1454
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:54,880
I used to love the...

1455
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,460
Like I was so obsessed with the climber.

1456
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,720
The climber was my K-pop stat.

1457
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:05,800
The climber was my BTS.

1458
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,720
All the women love the climber.

1459
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,000
Was it...

1460
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:19,560
Was it clamber?

1461
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:20,640
You must not...

1462
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,720
Wait, maybe I'm thinking of it wrong.

1463
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:24,140
What was his actual name?

1464
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,360
Is his name actually climber?

1465
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:31,060
I might be remembering it wrong too.

1466
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:32,520
Enling tournament.

1467
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:34,700
Ever...

1468
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,800
Ever After tournament.

1469
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:37,520
Okay.

1470
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:38,940
Was it Ever After?

1471
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,140
Okay, Enling.

1472
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,760
Oh my god, it's so long.

1473
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,140
What did he climb...

1474
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,040
I was... No, you don't understand!

1475
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,700
It was... Oh my god, it's so old that like... Oh my god.

1476
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:56,020
Was it... What was his... Oh my god.

1477
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:56,820
Okay, end zone.

1478
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:58,660
Okay, it was called the end zone.

1479
00:59:58,860 --> 00:59:59,680
Okay, who was...

1480
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:00,480
Who had competitors?

1481
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,740
Was he actually called... Yes, he was!

1482
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:04,740
He was called the climber!

1483
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:06,540
Okay, I was getting paranoid.

1484
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:08,160
I was like, am I forgetting it wrong?

1485
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:10,520
Because all the animation was made in Flash.

1486
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,620
Okay, but that shit, I love the lore!

1487
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:14,640
I'm so sad!

1488
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:16,920
The guy, the creator of...

1489
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:23,080
The creator of Climber, he fucking disappeared because he got a real job too.

1490
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,980
So... God damn it!

1491
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:29,740
Why do they all keep getting real jobs?

1492
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:36,340
But...

1493
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:41,400
But that shit was so good!

1494
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:54,640
Oh my gosh, I was like obsessed with like the lore behind this, the climber and like the ad... Okay, like you might think watch re-watching me because I re-watched the animations recently because it's on Flash.

1495
01:00:55,340 --> 01:01:07,840
Like it was on Flash, but somebody saved the animation... saved the animations and stuff on YouTube and I was re-watching it and I was like, oh the voice acting was not as good as I remembered it.

1496
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,900
I had... I had those rose tinted glasses on.

1497
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:17,120
It was not as... it was not as like pretty as I remember.

1498
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:20,720
The fight scenes though!

1499
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:23,220
The fight scenes were still pretty fucking good!

1500
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:29,140
I have to admit, like the fight scenes were actually pretty fucking insane though.

1501
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,220
Even if like, um...

1502
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:34,800
Even if like the voice acting wasn't as good.

1503
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:47,180
I think back then, because a lot of them were also like Newgrounds creators, I would say like Newgrounds creators are incredibly good at fight scenes and fight choreographies.

1504
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,740
Uh, Mouse, thank you for the... or Mouse, thank you for the super chat.

1505
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:51,380
Thank you, thank you.

1506
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:56,480
Hey Doki, any game recommendations to play when you're bored but won't get you too worked up?

1507
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:57,280
Thank you for the super chat.

1508
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,160
Thank you, thank you.

1509
01:01:58,220 --> 01:01:59,360
That is so difficult.

1510
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:04,740
I haven't been like actually playing any um... um games off stream.

1511
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,180
Um, because I feel like we're in like...

1512
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,480
low-key a gaming rut.

1513
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,460
Not gonna lie.

1514
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:17,060
Um, because like a lot of people would like recommend like a lot of like... what are those called?

1515
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:23,680
Like those crafting games with like crafting and stuff like that or... I would just say like... ah my gosh.

1516
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:34,460
I honestly feel like... for me, I feel like we're in a low-key gaming rut for me because like a lot of the games I like are not meta anymore.

1517
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:45,560
Um, there's... but like honestly if you don't want to get too worked up and want to pass the time, just play some open world survival games.

1518
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:49,020
Yeah, that's what I was gonna say, open world survival crafting games.

1519
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:55,420
Those are like the easiest um games that are like the most chill type deal.

1520
01:02:55,660 --> 01:03:00,920
Uh, I would say like... I haven't tried it out yet but a lot of people have been playing Planet Crafter recently.

1521
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,580
A lot of people saying like, Planet Crafter has been pretty good.

1522
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:09,680
Uh, but yeah, Oh my gosh, I... oh my god.

1523
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:10,740
And there was... what's his name?

1524
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:11,120
Carl?

1525
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:12,700
Oh my god, bro.

1526
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:14,880
I used to love those creators so much.

1527
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,340
Carl and the Climber.

1528
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,320
They were my BTS, man.

1529
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:25,160
They were so... I would draw fan art of them in my sketchbook all the time.

1530
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:26,800
It was pretty shitty fan art.

1531
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:37,240
But like I used to be so fucking obsessed with Carl and the Climber from... from like the end...

1532
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:38,240
like from the... what was it?

1533
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:39,540
The Law of Talos.

1534
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:44,140
The Law of Talos tournament and also the... the end zone.

1535
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:51,860
Oh my gosh, if you guys... I highly recommend checking out at least... I'm pretty sure the... the com...

1536
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:53,800
The creator still... oh my god, he's alive?

1537
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,620
Oh my... I'm gonna follow that.

1538
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:57,260
He was my hero.

1539
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,780
That guy was my hero.

1540
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:08,480
No, you don't understand.

1541
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,180
He was my fucking hero.

1542
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:12,340
I used to love that.

1543
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:19,560
I would like read all... I would like read like the lore and like absorb his lore... the lore of the Climber.

1544
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:23,280
Oh my god, his animations was like fucking sick.

1545
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,820
What's his Twitter, guys?

1546
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:27,180
Oh my god, bro.

1547
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,900
The last time he posted was in 2012, guys.

1548
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:31,880
Of course I would... he still...

1549
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:34,240
Oh my god, Photobucket.

1550
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,000
Bro, fucking Photobucket, man.

1551
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,120
Okay, guys.

1552
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:42,800
What is... what is his Twitter?

1553
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,060
I need to stalk him.

1554
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:44,980
I need...

1555
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:50,220
I need... I need to stalk this man.

1556
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:56,380
Alright, check his likes.

1557
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:57,120
What?

1558
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:58,100
Oh no.

1559
01:04:58,500 --> 01:04:59,760
Don't say it, please.

1560
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:01,160
Don't ruin...

1561
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,580
You know when they say don't meet your heroes?

1562
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,180
Don't ruin this for me.

1563
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:10,660
Please.

1564
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:15,140
I... I hope his likes would not be deal breakers.

1565
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:18,300
Do not ruin this creator for me.

1566
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:21,340
Mon!

1567
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:22,940
What's his Twitter?

1568
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:24,900
I need to know!

1569
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:28,300
Please, I need to follow him.

1570
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:33,880
I need to follow all my favorite creators that were my role models.

1571
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:36,220
Oh my gosh, I should not say role models.

1572
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:37,220
Because now I'm scared of him.

1573
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:38,220
I'm so scared about what his likes are.

1574
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:40,840
I'm so...

1575
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:45,520
Now I'm scared.

1576
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:46,820
I can't say role model.

1577
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,120
Because what if I shouldn't role model him?

1578
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:50,260
Like...

1579
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:53,060
No.

1580
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:55,600
No, don't ruin this.

1581
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:57,780
Like, I love this shit, bro.

1582
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,080
Don't fucking ruin this for me.

1583
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:04,420
But yes.

1584
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:06,580
Also, like... Oh, there was another creator.

1585
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:09,180
Really... I... Oh my gosh!

1586
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,480
It was like... Oh my god.

1587
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:16,560
I used to admire so many artists back then too.

1588
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:24,960
So it's like crazy going back memory lane and like how... how much... how much like...

1589
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:27,100
What's the word?

1590
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:30,520
How much they've like grown as an artist and stuff.

1591
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:35,840
I don't want to expose my shi...

1592
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:43,760
There was... There was this other artist that I used to like... I really like their art of.

1593
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:52,660
But like I'm worried that like... I'm like honestly worried about what... what they are now.

1594
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:56,460
Because... Oh my god.

1595
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:56,900
Okay.

1596
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:02,760
Because I know what happened to one of the creators and like what pathway they went to.

1597
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:05,660
So I... So I'm so embarrassed.

1598
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:10,020
But there was this artist that was known...

1599
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:11,620
Okay.

1600
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:13,500
It's gonna be... Okay.

1601
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:14,620
It's so fucked.

1602
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:15,500
Oh my god.

1603
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:19,000
Like when I read like... Like as I got older...

1604
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:22,780
And then... As I... As I got older...

1605
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:26,920
And then like I realized like... You know, they got older too.

1606
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:30,300
And then... Okay.

1607
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,060
I won't name anybody.

1608
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,160
I won't name names.

1609
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,000
But back then on DemonArt...

1610
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:39,680
Um... This was for Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.

1611
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:41,280
Um... Yes.

1612
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:41,640
Okay.

1613
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:42,140
Okay.

1614
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:44,440
Some people are like... know where it's gonna go.

1615
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:51,140
So like... There used to be like really popular things with like Animal Crossing and Mystery Dungeon.

1616
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:55,560
And like Pokemon... Pokemon and Pokemon Mystery Dungeon and stuff like that.

1617
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:57,580
And there would be like roleplay groups.

1618
01:07:57,820 --> 01:08:00,680
So like people would draw comics and stuff with like OCs.

1619
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:05,220
So a really famous one was the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon roleplay group.

1620
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:08,600
And... Let's just say...

1621
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:12,980
Um... The main creator of the roleplay group...

1622
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:15,580
Definitely went a different direction afterwards.

1623
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:30,660
I remember... It used to be so cute.

1624
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:33,980
It used to be like so cute.

1625
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:37,280
And the lore was so interesting.

1626
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:39,440
But then...

1627
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:41,420
Money talks...

1628
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:50,340
No... It's not Pokemon anymore.

1629
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:56,820
Let's just... Let's just say...

1630
01:08:56,820 --> 01:09:01,520
Um... Money definitely talks.

1631
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:03,840
And... Um...

1632
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:06,160
It's definitely...

1633
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:06,880
Uh...

1634
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:10,500
It's not about cute Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.

1635
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:10,960
It's about...

1636
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:11,820
It's not about cute Pokemon Mystery Dungeon missions anymore.

1637
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:12,960
And...

1638
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:15,380
And I just remembered...

1639
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:17,220
Because I used to follow this artist.

1640
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,580
Because I really liked their art.

1641
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,000
Because it was so cute.

1642
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:23,660
And the story was so interesting.

1643
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:26,960
And then it went a different direction.

1644
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:32,980
I won't say the name.

1645
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:39,920
But for anyone that ever followed the DeviantArt Pokemon Mystery Dungeon roleplay groups.

1646
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,020
Like the most famous one.

1647
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:45,540
Would know exactly who I'm talking about.

1648
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:46,840
Like they...

1649
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:47,800
They...

1650
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:50,080
They...

1651
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:51,200
They would know.

1652
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:52,960
Because they were like one of the...

1653
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:59,040
They were the most famous Pokemon Mystery Dungeon like artist back then.

1654
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:00,260
And...

1655
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:03,080
And it went a different direction half...

1656
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,200
A couple of years later.

1657
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:09,900
I can't believe it.

1658
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:10,500
Like name it.

1659
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:11,860
I guess like they still do...

1660
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:13,080
They still make content.

1661
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:14,860
So I can't say anything.

1662
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:16,200
It's just...

1663
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:16,660
You know.

1664
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:17,880
When people get older.

1665
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:19,120
I guess they...

1666
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:19,980
They...

1667
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:20,420
You know.

1668
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:21,760
They got bills to pay.

1669
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:22,640
And everything.

1670
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:23,260
I understand.

1671
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:24,840
They get...

1672
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:26,260
They have bills to pay.

1673
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:28,320
And there's a market for it.

1674
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:29,560
But like...

1675
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:30,360
Oh my god.

1676
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,400
Little me was not ready for that.

1677
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:33,820
Little me.

1678
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:36,860
Little me.

1679
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:39,060
Just liked cute art.

1680
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:39,880
And...

1681
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:41,060
I was just like...

1682
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,420
You know what they say, don't meet your heroes.

1683
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:14,440
That's why I'm so afraid.

1684
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:15,640
I'm so afraid.

1685
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:18,440
Like someone was like, don't check this person's likes.

1686
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:19,580
And now I'm scared.

1687
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:24,960
Now I'm scared.

1688
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:31,220
Because like, I've had that moment before where like I used to admire...

1689
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:33,720
I mean, they had really good art.

1690
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:36,420
You know?

1691
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:38,740
They got older.

1692
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:43,980
I'm scared.

1693
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:45,300
Delta, thank you for the super chat.

1694
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:45,720
Thank you.

1695
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:46,400
Thank you.

1696
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:47,560
And I'm scared.

1697
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:54,340
Because usually... usually... you know... when people get older...

1698
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:55,960
I don't know.

1699
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:56,680
I'm scared.

1700
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:03,220
Just... I don't know what they're doing now.

1701
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:04,900
I don't know.

1702
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:06,660
I don't know.

1703
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:07,660
I'm worried.

1704
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:08,500
My childhood.

1705
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:09,880
I don't want my childhood to be like this.

1706
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:11,000
I don't want my childhood to be...

1707
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,360
I don't want my childhood to be gone again.

1708
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:18,160
Oh my gosh.

1709
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:19,200
Also like...

1710
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,680
Similar with like Newground animators.

1711
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:28,740
There's like... there's like some Newground animators that I've like...

1712
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:34,100
super admired and like was like really into their arts and animation.

1713
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:37,100
And I was like, what are they up to these days?

1714
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,060
And then...

1715
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:39,040
Porn.

1716
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:39,740
Straight up.

1717
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:47,350
I was like...

1718
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:51,230
I checked their Twitter.

1719
01:12:51,390 --> 01:12:52,430
I was like, oh!

1720
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:54,090
That's a dick.

1721
01:12:58,990 --> 01:13:00,690
I was like...

1722
01:13:01,450 --> 01:13:03,310
I was like, whoa!

1723
01:13:03,930 --> 01:13:04,250
Alright.

1724
01:13:05,650 --> 01:13:07,410
That takes me back.

1725
01:13:07,410 --> 01:13:09,610
Got a pill in my...

1726
01:13:09,610 --> 01:13:10,250
Yeah.

1727
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:13,030
Um...

1728
01:13:13,030 --> 01:13:14,070
I only have someone...

1729
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:17,370
Literally every Newground animator I knew back in like 2012.

1730
01:13:17,690 --> 01:13:18,170
Porn.

1731
01:13:18,290 --> 01:13:18,850
All of them.

1732
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:20,290
Every single one!

1733
01:13:20,770 --> 01:13:22,110
Thank you for the super chat.

1734
01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:23,570
He wasn't even super chat.

1735
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:25,630
I was like, oh...

1736
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:26,590
Okay.

1737
01:13:27,490 --> 01:13:28,090
Okay.

1738
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:30,230
Thank you for the super chat.

1739
01:13:30,330 --> 01:13:30,630
Thank you.

1740
01:13:30,670 --> 01:13:31,170
Thank you.

1741
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:36,410
It's either like... that direction or they're... or they're... you know...

1742
01:13:37,010 --> 01:13:39,430
Or they're making... making like...

1743
01:13:39,430 --> 01:13:42,590
Or they went viral for like a video game or a TV show.

1744
01:13:42,830 --> 01:13:43,850
It's one or the other.

1745
01:13:44,290 --> 01:13:47,250
It's one or the other.

1746
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:48,870
Either a show...

1747
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:50,830
Either a cartoon show...

1748
01:13:50,830 --> 01:13:51,590
Or you know...

1749
01:13:52,610 --> 01:13:53,210
Drawing porn.

1750
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:56,390
Genki, thank you for the super chat.

1751
01:13:56,470 --> 01:13:56,750
Thank you.

1752
01:13:57,390 --> 01:13:59,630
I meant check his likes to see if he was still active.

1753
01:13:59,670 --> 01:14:01,090
Didn't mean the other way.

1754
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:01,430
Oh!

1755
01:14:01,850 --> 01:14:02,750
Oh thank god.

1756
01:14:02,850 --> 01:14:03,110
Okay.

1757
01:14:03,390 --> 01:14:04,270
I like Genki.

1758
01:14:04,450 --> 01:14:06,390
Like I misinterpreted that and it started to...

1759
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:07,070
It started a whole thing.

1760
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:10,190
It started a whole fucking tangent on its own.

1761
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:11,650
Thank you for the super chat.

1762
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:12,190
Thank you.

1763
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:12,870
Thank you.

1764
01:14:15,890 --> 01:14:16,690
But yeah.

1765
01:14:17,430 --> 01:14:18,350
Blast from the past.

1766
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:20,130
Hanta, thank you for the super chat.

1767
01:14:20,230 --> 01:14:20,490
Thank you.

1768
01:14:20,510 --> 01:14:21,030
Thank you.

1769
01:14:21,210 --> 01:14:22,750
Everyone was too young back then.

1770
01:14:22,870 --> 01:14:24,670
But then they realized this dark side of money.

1771
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:26,610
For me, I am just stuck with...

1772
01:14:28,170 --> 01:14:29,510
Thank you for the super chat.

1773
01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:29,870
Thank you.

1774
01:14:29,890 --> 01:14:30,390
Thank you.

1775
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:34,360
Yeah.

1776
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:36,500
Also, the more I talk about this...

1777
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:42,180
The more I realize I was way too young to be like reading or watching any of these things.

1778
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:45,180
By the way, I should have never been allowed on the internet.

1779
01:14:48,140 --> 01:14:53,140
The thing is, I didn't even start on the internet really young.

1780
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:59,360
I wasn't allowed to be on the internet for a long time until like I was...

1781
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:02,960
I wasn't allowed to be on the internet until like really, really late.

1782
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:04,700
So like I didn't even have...

1783
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,480
Like I wasn't even allowed to have...

1784
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:09,100
Like I didn't even have like a Facebook account when like people were...

1785
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:11,300
People... everybody made Facebook accounts.

1786
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:12,400
And like...

1787
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:16,660
One of my friends had to make a Facebook account for me.

1788
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:18,600
Because I had no idea about Facebook.

1789
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:20,740
And then all I did...

1790
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:22,980
I think when I was finally allowed to be on the internet...

1791
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:24,520
All I did was play Neopets.

1792
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:29,100
All I did...

1793
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:31,500
I was just like...

1794
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:31,940
Yay!

1795
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:34,820
Like I just played Neopets instead.

1796
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:36,460
Instead of doing anything.

1797
01:15:44,580 --> 01:15:46,020
But yeah, anyway.

1798
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,280
That was like usually...

1799
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:53,960
And then like later on when I found out what the internet was really like.

1800
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:56,820
When I found out what the internet was really like.

1801
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:58,360
I sort of like...

1802
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:00,740
I went all in.

1803
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:01,800
So like...

1804
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:04,200
I like explored the internet a lot.

1805
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:04,800
So like...

1806
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:19,700
I read a lot of internet comics.

1807
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:27,380
Fanfiction.net Before they...

1808
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:28,740
Okay.

1809
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:31,100
I did something a little illegal.

1810
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:35,540
I definitely should not have been reading some of the fanfics.

1811
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:41,800
I definitely should not have been reading the lemon one.

1812
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,280
Fanfiction.net

1813
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:58,340
And then also...

1814
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:00,180
Also, you know...

1815
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:00,760
I...

1816
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:05,800
I found out about Newgrounds and artwork and stuff like that.

1817
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:06,940
And...

1818
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:09,400
The what?

1819
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:11,700
Let's say lemon and limes.

1820
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,680
Lemon and limes.

1821
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:15,960
Nova, thank you for the super chat.

1822
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:16,780
Thank you, thank you.

1823
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:17,640
Sup, Dokiho.

1824
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:18,600
Your night's been going well.

1825
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:19,900
I think it's been going pretty well.

1826
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:20,880
Thank you for the super chat.

1827
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:21,620
Thank you, thank you.

1828
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,320
Welcome to the internet.

1829
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:24,640
Ba-da-na-na-na.

1830
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:28,020
Ba-da-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.

1831
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:34,260
If you know, you know.

1832
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,440
I was an internet connoisseur.

1833
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:43,420
Oh my god.

1834
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:46,880
And then the live journal role-playing groups.

1835
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:47,720
Okay.

1836
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:50,140
Back then.

1837
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:51,720
I should not...

1838
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:54,920
You know how they're like, you gotta be 18 and over to read this?

1839
01:17:55,140 --> 01:17:56,500
Read this.

1840
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:59,460
I was 18 for a very long time.

1841
01:18:06,570 --> 01:18:09,150
I was 18 for a while.

1842
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:15,070
So there was like this...

1843
01:18:15,910 --> 01:18:17,610
There was like this...

1844
01:18:18,590 --> 01:18:23,310
There was this famous live journal role-play groups where...

1845
01:18:23,310 --> 01:18:27,470
Who wasn't reading Lemons when we really should and have been.

1846
01:18:28,130 --> 01:18:29,730
Thank you for the super chat, Nexi.

1847
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:30,770
Thank you, thank you.

1848
01:18:30,990 --> 01:18:32,250
Okay, so...

1849
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:32,770
I'm gonna go back to the chat.

1850
01:18:34,850 --> 01:18:35,250
Um...

1851
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:36,370
If you know, you know.

1852
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:39,170
There was like, there were these famous live journal...

1853
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:41,810
For those who don't know what live journal is, it was like...

1854
01:18:41,810 --> 01:18:44,590
A lot of like old people would use...

1855
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:45,030
I'm sorry.

1856
01:18:49,150 --> 01:18:52,170
A lot of the older generations would use it.

1857
01:18:52,230 --> 01:18:52,670
I was...

1858
01:18:52,670 --> 01:18:53,610
Definitely was not...

1859
01:18:53,610 --> 01:18:56,030
I should not have been allowed on live journal.

1860
01:18:56,230 --> 01:18:58,130
I was way too young for live journal.

1861
01:18:58,170 --> 01:18:59,550
I should not have been on that.

1862
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:00,490
But I've been 15...

1863
01:19:00,490 --> 01:19:02,290
I've been 18 for a very long time.

1864
01:19:02,430 --> 01:19:02,830
Um...

1865
01:19:02,830 --> 01:19:03,210
Um...

1866
01:19:03,210 --> 01:19:04,470
I mean...

1867
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:05,250
I...

1868
01:19:06,530 --> 01:19:09,010
It was like pre-tumblr.

1869
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:11,330
It was basically pre-tumblr.

1870
01:19:11,570 --> 01:19:13,170
And um...

1871
01:19:13,170 --> 01:19:15,970
And there was like a lot of like anime communities on there.

1872
01:19:16,030 --> 01:19:18,470
I would use live journal to like...

1873
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:19,070
Uh...

1874
01:19:19,070 --> 01:19:21,670
Take the icons for like anime shows.

1875
01:19:21,850 --> 01:19:23,770
Like some of my favorite anime shows.

1876
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:24,870
Oh my god.

1877
01:19:24,910 --> 01:19:27,510
I was part of the Glee live journal community.

1878
01:19:30,710 --> 01:19:31,390
I...

1879
01:19:31,390 --> 01:19:32,150
Okay.

1880
01:19:32,830 --> 01:19:33,610
I would admit.

1881
01:19:33,770 --> 01:19:40,310
I would take some of the animated icons from the Oran High School Host Club live journal community.

1882
01:19:40,630 --> 01:19:43,810
And the Glee one to put on my MSN icons.

1883
01:19:45,290 --> 01:19:47,790
And please don't not Glee.

1884
01:19:48,930 --> 01:19:49,570
Anyway.

1885
01:19:51,690 --> 01:19:52,330
Anyway.

1886
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:53,390
Um...

1887
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:54,610
As I was saying.

1888
01:19:55,210 --> 01:19:55,850
Um...

1889
01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:58,410
There was like this live journal roleplay community.

1890
01:19:58,570 --> 01:20:01,910
Where like people will roleplay as like different characters.

1891
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:02,810
From...

1892
01:20:02,810 --> 01:20:03,650
Different...

1893
01:20:03,650 --> 01:20:04,150
Uh...

1894
01:20:04,150 --> 01:20:06,030
From different fandoms.

1895
01:20:06,030 --> 01:20:09,890
So like it was like a fucking mix mash of like...

1896
01:20:09,890 --> 01:20:13,570
It would be like the Team Fortress 2 sniper meeting.

1897
01:20:13,650 --> 01:20:14,350
I don't know.

1898
01:20:14,430 --> 01:20:17,410
Meeting Hikaru from Oran High School Host Club.

1899
01:20:17,590 --> 01:20:21,690
And it would be like the most insane roleplay session ever.

1900
01:20:22,010 --> 01:20:24,890
Like there would be like so much lore in it.

1901
01:20:24,970 --> 01:20:26,130
And then it was all public.

1902
01:20:26,330 --> 01:20:32,250
So then I would like read the roleplay sessions of like random fucking characters.

1903
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:33,650
Talking to each other.

1904
01:20:33,910 --> 01:20:34,570
And...

1905
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:37,070
I don't...

1906
01:20:37,070 --> 01:20:39,670
Bro I don't remember what it was.

1907
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:40,970
It was just like...

1908
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:41,710
It was...

1909
01:20:41,710 --> 01:20:44,650
It was either like super hinged or...

1910
01:20:45,350 --> 01:20:45,690
Or...

1911
01:20:46,030 --> 01:20:46,610
Like...

1912
01:20:46,610 --> 01:20:47,290
Or...

1913
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:50,550
Or it would just be like super casual.

1914
01:20:50,870 --> 01:20:51,690
Like okay.

1915
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:52,590
Guys.

1916
01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:54,370
Not everything was a lemon.

1917
01:20:54,650 --> 01:20:56,390
Not everything was lemons.

1918
01:20:56,690 --> 01:20:59,190
Sometimes it was just general interactions.

1919
01:20:59,650 --> 01:21:01,950
Like what if the Team Fortress 2 sniper...

1920
01:21:01,950 --> 01:21:04,350
Met up with this random anime character.

1921
01:21:04,570 --> 01:21:08,070
There was like this really popular one with a Persona character.

1922
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:12,070
Like she was the one that was like wearing the detective one.

1923
01:21:12,190 --> 01:21:13,570
Not the Persona 4.

1924
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:14,310
No wait.

1925
01:21:14,390 --> 01:21:16,190
What Persona are we on in now?

1926
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:16,890
Like...

1927
01:21:17,390 --> 01:21:19,910
It was before Persona...

1928
01:21:19,910 --> 01:21:20,190
Not 4.

1929
01:21:20,350 --> 01:21:21,690
It was Persona 4.

1930
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:23,690
Okay that detective character from Persona 4.

1931
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:25,230
It was so famous.

1932
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:26,590
Like they actually were like...

1933
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:28,850
They became famous in the LiveJournal community.

1934
01:21:29,230 --> 01:21:31,890
And like the detective character from Persona 4.

1935
01:21:31,890 --> 01:21:33,770
And like this person was like...

1936
01:21:33,770 --> 01:21:35,910
I don't remember who the fuck was she like...

1937
01:21:35,910 --> 01:21:37,930
What were they coupled with.

1938
01:21:38,050 --> 01:21:42,370
But like I followed that person's LiveJournal post a lot.

1939
01:21:42,610 --> 01:21:43,990
Because they...

1940
01:21:43,990 --> 01:21:47,310
I followed that person's LiveJournal post so much.

1941
01:21:47,590 --> 01:21:50,090
Because they were a really good writer.

1942
01:21:51,730 --> 01:21:53,870
They were a really good writer.

1943
01:21:53,970 --> 01:21:56,730
And like I was like so immersed.

1944
01:21:57,130 --> 01:21:59,530
I was so immersed in the lore.

1945
01:21:59,870 --> 01:22:00,550
Hahaha.

1946
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:03,330
Like this lore.

1947
01:22:03,570 --> 01:22:04,890
And then oh my god.

1948
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:07,350
I remember like at one point this...

1949
01:22:07,350 --> 01:22:10,590
They met Pinkie Pie from Final Point.

1950
01:22:11,690 --> 01:22:16,590
There was a roleplay session with Pinkie Pie from Final...

1951
01:22:16,590 --> 01:22:17,650
It was so serious.

1952
01:22:17,790 --> 01:22:20,890
I wish I remembered...

1953
01:22:20,890 --> 01:22:24,010
I wish I remembered like...

1954
01:22:24,010 --> 01:22:27,990
I remembered what it was called.

1955
01:22:28,350 --> 01:22:30,290
It was so popular.

1956
01:22:30,550 --> 01:22:31,390
Um...

1957
01:22:32,510 --> 01:22:33,730
It was so funny.

1958
01:22:33,890 --> 01:22:35,090
It was just so funny.

1959
01:22:35,410 --> 01:22:35,910
Um...

1960
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:37,150
It was actual lore.

1961
01:22:37,410 --> 01:22:39,530
Because like at one point there was a murder mystery.

1962
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:43,370
With a bunch of random anime characters and cartoon...

1963
01:22:43,370 --> 01:22:45,210
Anime, cartoon and game characters.

1964
01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:48,070
It got to a murder mystery at one point.

1965
01:22:48,170 --> 01:22:51,830
That they were trying to figure out a murder with a bunch of anime characters.

1966
01:22:52,190 --> 01:22:53,510
Slash cartoon characters.

1967
01:22:53,890 --> 01:22:55,270
Slash game characters.

1968
01:22:55,550 --> 01:22:58,430
And I was so obsessed with what the fuck was going on.

1969
01:22:58,550 --> 01:23:00,030
And it was all roleplay.

1970
01:23:00,270 --> 01:23:00,690
Hahaha.

1971
01:23:00,990 --> 01:23:01,370
Hahaha.

1972
01:23:01,370 --> 01:23:01,850
It was...

1973
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:02,390
Hahaha.

1974
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:04,930
Hahaha.

1975
01:23:05,970 --> 01:23:06,650
Um...

1976
01:23:06,650 --> 01:23:08,590
Thank you for the Akasupa.

1977
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:09,590

1978
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:19,130

1979
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:20,870
Thank you for the Akasupa.

1980
01:23:20,950 --> 01:23:21,330
Thank you.

1981
01:23:21,590 --> 01:23:23,470
I love crossovers.

1982
01:23:23,730 --> 01:23:24,430
Who was the...

1983
01:23:24,430 --> 01:23:25,690
I don't fucking know.

1984
01:23:25,810 --> 01:23:29,190
I barely remembered what it was about.

1985
01:23:29,390 --> 01:23:31,190
I just remembered like the general...

1986
01:23:31,190 --> 01:23:33,030
Generalness of it all.

1987
01:23:33,190 --> 01:23:34,210
Oh my god.

1988
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:37,270
Um...

1989
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:38,370
But yeah, anyway.

1990
01:23:38,490 --> 01:23:40,830
That was like my internet history.

1991
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:43,510
That was literally my internet history.

1992
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:45,050
Growing up.

1993
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:47,270
It was a wild internet history.

1994
01:23:47,410 --> 01:23:48,650
I should have never...

1995
01:23:48,650 --> 01:23:50,370
I should have not been...

1996
01:23:50,370 --> 01:23:51,150
Hahaha.

1997
01:23:51,510 --> 01:23:54,650
On those sites with how young I was.

1998
01:23:54,810 --> 01:23:58,370
I should have 100% not been on any of those sites.

1999
01:23:58,510 --> 01:23:59,170
For sure.

2000
01:23:59,590 --> 01:24:00,110
Hahaha.

2001
01:24:02,050 --> 01:24:03,450
I need you guys to know.

2002
01:24:03,550 --> 01:24:05,750
When I started out my internet history.

2003
01:24:06,170 --> 01:24:08,130
I was like playing Neopets, right?

2004
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:09,090
I even had to...

2005
01:24:09,090 --> 01:24:10,170
I was so naive.

2006
01:24:10,230 --> 01:24:13,390
I didn't lie about my age when I started on Neopets.

2007
01:24:13,790 --> 01:24:19,170
To the point where like my parents had to fax the Neopets headquarters.

2008
01:24:20,030 --> 01:24:28,670
Proof that I had parental permission to access the more restricted areas of Neopets.

2009
01:24:28,670 --> 01:24:29,270
Hahaha.

2010
01:24:29,990 --> 01:24:33,510
And you guys were like the restricted areas of Neopets?

2011
01:24:33,690 --> 01:24:34,670
What are those?

2012
01:24:35,030 --> 01:24:36,630
It was basically the forums.

2013
01:24:36,890 --> 01:24:37,850
Like um...

2014
01:24:38,890 --> 01:24:39,930
The Neoboards.

2015
01:24:40,130 --> 01:24:42,650
Because like I didn't lie about my age.

2016
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:44,750
So I wasn't allowed to talk to anybody online.

2017
01:24:45,190 --> 01:24:46,910
Or like use the Neomail.

2018
01:24:47,010 --> 01:24:47,490
Or anything.

2019
01:24:47,990 --> 01:24:49,890
So they had to like...

2020
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:52,850
They're like oh if you're underage and you want to access the Neoboards.

2021
01:24:52,970 --> 01:24:54,310
You have to fax...

2022
01:24:54,310 --> 01:24:55,010
Um...

2023
01:24:56,270 --> 01:24:58,650
You have to fax in your parents.

2024
01:24:58,670 --> 01:25:00,190
Parental permission.

2025
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:01,370
Hahaha.

2026
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:03,270
Like a permission slip.

2027
01:25:03,470 --> 01:25:06,950
So you can like access the Neoboards and talk to the adults.

2028
01:25:07,190 --> 01:25:07,670
So...

2029
01:25:08,910 --> 01:25:09,430
So...

2030
01:25:10,350 --> 01:25:13,290
So I had to get that happen.

2031
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:15,230
Because I wanted to like...

2032
01:25:15,230 --> 01:25:18,450
I would be like I want to talk to strangers on the internet.

2033
01:25:19,470 --> 01:25:19,990
Hahaha.

2034
01:25:20,530 --> 01:25:21,050
Hahaha.

2035
01:25:21,710 --> 01:25:25,250
It's like man I want to talk to the stranger.

2036
01:25:25,350 --> 01:25:26,150
Okay I didn't tell her.

2037
01:25:26,310 --> 01:25:27,250
They didn't know.

2038
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:31,670
It ended up being I talked to random strangers on the internet.

2039
01:25:31,890 --> 01:25:32,730
But like...

2040
01:25:32,730 --> 01:25:34,030
Because like it was just like...

2041
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:35,590
They just like access to things.

2042
01:25:35,690 --> 01:25:37,730
So they didn't realize at that time.

2043
01:25:37,910 --> 01:25:41,270
It basically led to me knowing more about the internet.

2044
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:42,770
Because you know...

2045
01:25:42,770 --> 01:25:45,510
I started talking to fucking adults on the internet.

2046
01:25:46,590 --> 01:25:46,690
Hahaha.

2047
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:49,660
Hahaha.

2048
01:25:49,660 --> 01:25:51,860
I definitely should not have been.

2049
01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:53,540
Because like...

2050
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:55,780
Because like you guys didn't know back then.

2051
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:58,320
Neopets was like um...

2052
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,520
Was mostly for adults.

2053
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:02,120
And for college students.

2054
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:05,780
Like and I was definitely neither of them.

2055
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:06,560
Hahaha.

2056
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:07,280
Hahaha.

2057
01:26:08,620 --> 01:26:11,260
So there was a lot of like...

2058
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:12,360
Like it was like...

2059
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:14,380
I remember I talked about the story before.

2060
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:16,600
But like there was a help section.

2061
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:18,380
There was a help section.

2062
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:20,420
And um...

2063
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:22,580
And like in the neoboard.

2064
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:24,060
And I was like really scared.

2065
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:26,560
Because I was like oh my god.

2066
01:26:26,660 --> 01:26:28,120

2068
01:26:28,540 --> 01:26:29,680
I think I was like oh my gosh.

2069
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:32,200

No.

2096
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:32,960
It was just one person.

2097
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:33,820
There were several people.

2098
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:34,760
And they were like...

2099
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:36,400
Oh do not worry about middle school.

2100
01:27:36,580 --> 01:27:37,580
It's high school.

2101
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:39,780
You have to worry about...

2102
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:40,720
Hahaha.

2103
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:45,120
Oh my god.

2104
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:49,720
It was so embarrassing thinking back to it.

2105
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:50,960
Oh...

2106
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:51,540

2107
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:53,560
No trauma dumping child.

2108
01:27:53,940 --> 01:27:56,560
This is neopets man.

2109
01:27:57,180 --> 01:27:57,360
Hahaha.

2110
01:27:57,640 --> 01:28:00,460
I told this story in the ROPLOX stream.

2111
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:01,980
But like I also...

2112
01:28:01,980 --> 01:28:04,680
There was a roleplay board on neopets.

2113
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,780
And because I wasn't a high schooler.

2114
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:08,540
I would like join...

2115
01:28:08,540 --> 01:28:08,860
Okay.

01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:09,920
It's funny.

2117
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:12,080
Because I swear to god.

2118
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:15,000
I'm pretty sure majority of the people.

2119
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:17,300
That were in the high school roleplay.

2120
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,800
Has never been to high school before.

2121
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:20,680
Hahaha.

2122
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:23,120
Because I was just some fucking...

2123
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:24,320
Middle schooler.

2124
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:26,340
Roleplaying as a high school student.

2125
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:28,100
Like in those high school boards.

2126
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:28,660
Where like...

2127
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:30,800

2128
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,940
Oh I'm in like 10th.

2129
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:33,800

2130
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:35,940
And I...

2131
01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:36,260
Hahaha.

2132
01:28:36,820 --> 01:28:37,860
Because they're like...

2133
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:40,720
Imagine what high school could be for us.

2134
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:41,340
Hahaha.

2135
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:47,100
Just faking it.

2136
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:48,020
So like...

2137
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:49,320
There'll be like roleplay boards.

2138
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:51,020
Where you're pretending you're high school students.

2139
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:52,880
And then there's like multiple versions of it.

2140
01:28:52,940 --> 01:28:53,980
It's like high school.

2141
01:28:54,260 --> 01:28:56,340
But like what if we're like...

2142
01:28:56,340 --> 01:28:57,740
We all have powers.

2143
01:28:57,780 --> 01:28:59,180
So like mutants.

2144
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:01,100
Like X-Men high school roleplay.

2145
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:02,340
Or like...

2146
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:04,800

And then I would have like my intro pre-written.

2166
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:46,020
And everything.

2167
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:48,540
So I could just copy and paste it as a...

2168
01:29:48,540 --> 01:29:51,400
Like to start the story of my character.

2169
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:53,200
And it would be like...

2170
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:53,920
Hahaha.

2171
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:57,020
I wish I still have it.

2172
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:59,020
So I could like cringe at it.

2173
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:00,700
I really... It was... Oh my god.

2174
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,640
I really do wish...

2175
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:05,340
I still... I still have it.

2176
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,680
It's so fucking cringe.

2177
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:09,300
Thinking back.

2178
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:11,300
Oh my god.

2179
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:13,980
I did not get online.

2180
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:16,860
I was way too young for Gaia online.

2181
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:20,220
So like Neopets was like the baby version of that.

2182
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:21,060
Um...

2183
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:21,680
Hahaha.

2184
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:24,440
The cringe is overwhelming.

2185
01:30:24,860 --> 01:30:27,540
I was way too young to use Gaia online.

2186
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:29,540
So like there was a baby...

2187
01:30:29,540 --> 01:30:30,480
Baby version.

2188
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:31,780
For me.

2189
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:32,820
For me.

2190
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:34,480
Hahaha.

2191
01:30:35,660 --> 01:30:38,340
This is giving me emotional damage.

2192
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:39,960
That I wasn't prepared for.

2193
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:42,800
Oh and now I'm illiterate.

2194
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:44,380
I feel like...

2195
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:45,900
I hit my peak.

2196
01:30:46,740 --> 01:30:47,080
Um...

2197
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:51,220
I definitely hit my peak.

2198
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:52,960
In terms of intelligence.

2199
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:53,920
And writing.

2200
01:30:54,220 --> 01:30:56,740
Um during that stage of Neopets.

2201
01:30:56,820 --> 01:30:59,600
And then everything else was downhill from there.

2202
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:00,700
Like...

2203
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:02,320
I...

2204
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:03,640
I wrote a lot.

2205
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,860
For Neopets roleplay.

2206
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:08,040
And then as I got older.

2207
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:09,760
I realized I...

2208
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:13,320
I definitely got more and more stupid and illiterate.

2209
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:14,520
The older I got.

2210
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:15,500
Hahaha.

2211
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:17,620
Hahaha.

2212
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:21,180
Oh my god.

2213
01:31:21,260 --> 01:31:22,440
Holy shit.

2214
01:31:22,740 --> 01:31:25,520
I've been yapping for so long already.

2215
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:26,560
Oh was there already...

2216
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,340
An hour and thirty minutes?

2217
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,980
Oh my god.

2218
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:33,960
What did I miss?

2219
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:36,980
You missed cringe doki internet history.

2220
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:38,180
It was...

2221
01:31:38,180 --> 01:31:40,420
It was pretty fucking cringe back then.

2222
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:42,460
But who else wasn't like cringe?

2223
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:44,240
But everybody was cringe back then.

2224
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:45,660
Um...

2225
01:31:45,660 --> 01:31:48,060
Everybody was like super cringe back then.

2226
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:48,980
Cause we didn't know better.

2227
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:52,500
I definitely should not have been talking to adults for sure.

2228
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:54,100
But like um...

2229
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:55,480
At the age I was.

2230
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:56,200
I'm...

2231
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:59,600
We did not know what was safe for kids.

2232
01:31:59,860 --> 01:32:00,420
Hahaha.

2233
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:04,660
People back then.

2234
01:32:04,700 --> 01:32:05,560
Did not realize.

2235
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:07,880
That it was sort of a bad idea.

2236
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,560
That we had like little doki.

2237
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:14,060
Talking to fucking college students.

2238
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:14,800
Hahaha.

2239
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:18,770
Oh my god.

2240
01:32:18,770 --> 01:32:19,610
I'm just thinking about that.

2241
01:32:19,690 --> 01:32:23,090
Why did they talk to me?

2242
01:32:23,570 --> 01:32:23,750
Hahaha.

2243
01:32:25,130 --> 01:32:25,430
Hahaha.

2244
01:32:25,830 --> 01:32:26,410
Hahaha.

2245
01:32:28,630 --> 01:32:29,850
Oh my god.

2246
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:32,210
Um...

2247
01:32:32,910 --> 01:32:33,810
Um... but yeah.

2248
01:32:33,990 --> 01:32:35,470
But it's from Neopets.

2249
01:32:35,470 --> 01:32:36,730
Because of the boards.

2250
01:32:36,890 --> 01:32:38,390
On the Neopet boards.

2251
01:32:38,870 --> 01:32:41,910
It led to me discovering DeviantArt.

2252
01:32:42,110 --> 01:32:44,390
And then from DeviantArt.

2253
01:32:44,390 --> 01:32:49,230
It led to me discovering like other stuff on the internet.

2254
01:32:49,410 --> 01:32:50,650
Like from DeviantArt.

2255
01:32:50,770 --> 01:32:52,030
To fanfiction.net.

2256
01:32:52,230 --> 01:32:53,370
To Tumblr.

2257
01:32:53,490 --> 01:32:55,790
And to LiveJournal.

2258
01:32:56,090 --> 01:32:58,070
It was all downhill.

2259
01:32:58,370 --> 01:32:59,270
The moment.

2260
01:32:59,410 --> 01:33:03,710
The moment my parents faxed that parental permission slip.

2261
01:33:03,910 --> 01:33:05,530
It was over for me.

2262
01:33:05,650 --> 01:33:06,950
It was so over.

2263
01:33:07,050 --> 01:33:08,950
I sped run my internet cloud.

2264
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:10,430
Like I'm not in TickleCloud.

2265
01:33:10,650 --> 01:33:14,270
I sped run my internet like um intake.

2266
01:33:14,390 --> 01:33:14,810
Like...

2267
01:33:16,030 --> 01:33:18,630
I learned things on the internet.

2268
01:33:18,730 --> 01:33:20,790
At an exponential rate.

2269
01:33:21,090 --> 01:33:22,430
At because of that.

2270
01:33:22,550 --> 01:33:26,930
All because my parents faxed in that parental permission slip.

2271
01:33:27,150 --> 01:33:27,570
All because my parents faxed in that parental permission slip.

2272
01:33:27,570 --> 01:33:28,650
And it went downhill.

2273
01:33:29,010 --> 01:33:30,250
In the pipeline.

2274
01:33:32,490 --> 01:33:34,450
Neopets to Newgrounds.

2275
01:33:34,450 --> 01:33:36,050
That was not the way it should go.

2276
01:33:36,430 --> 01:33:37,150
But...

2277
01:33:37,930 --> 01:33:39,170
But it did.

2278
01:33:39,510 --> 01:33:41,590
It fucking did.

2279
01:33:42,390 --> 01:33:43,910
Oh my god.

2280
01:33:44,830 --> 01:33:45,930
Oh my god.

2281
01:33:45,970 --> 01:33:47,450
I also had like...

2282
01:33:47,450 --> 01:33:49,950
Wait let me see if I can...

2283
01:33:50,530 --> 01:33:51,430
Find it.

2284
01:33:51,590 --> 01:33:53,230
I also had like...

2285
01:33:57,230 --> 01:33:59,750
I started liking videos.

2286
01:34:00,350 --> 01:34:01,270
To like...

2287
01:34:01,270 --> 01:34:02,550
As for like...

2288
01:34:02,550 --> 01:34:03,810
Not intel.

2289
01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:04,490
What's the word?

2290
01:34:06,310 --> 01:34:07,250
For like...

2291
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:09,370
I guess like topics and stuff in the future.

2292
01:34:09,490 --> 01:34:11,810
So if I find something funny and interesting.

2293
01:34:12,150 --> 01:34:12,930
Oh my god.

2294
01:34:12,970 --> 01:34:14,110
Did you guys see the...

2295
01:34:15,210 --> 01:34:17,090
That fucking Furby video?

2296
01:34:19,410 --> 01:34:20,410
Of like...

2297
01:34:20,410 --> 01:34:21,150
To a couple.

2298
01:34:21,370 --> 01:34:24,570
This couple made a Furby...

2299
01:34:24,570 --> 01:34:26,530
Not like a Furby robot.

2300
01:34:27,050 --> 01:34:28,210
Did you guys see that?

2301
01:34:28,370 --> 01:34:30,570
That shit was so fucking...

2302
01:34:31,650 --> 01:34:32,810
With the like...

2303
01:34:32,810 --> 01:34:33,750
Boston robots.

2304
01:34:34,370 --> 01:34:36,650
They fucking took the Boston robots.

2305
01:34:37,390 --> 01:34:38,750
Dog robot.

2306
01:34:38,970 --> 01:34:41,230
And then turned it into a freak of nature.

2307
01:34:42,030 --> 01:34:43,350
You guys haven't...

2308
01:34:43,350 --> 01:34:43,570
Okay.

2309
01:34:44,970 --> 01:34:46,730
I'm gonna fucking show you.

2310
01:34:47,330 --> 01:34:48,650
I'm gonna...

2311
01:34:48,650 --> 01:34:50,050
Show you this.

2312
01:34:53,730 --> 01:34:54,830
Look at this.

2313
01:34:55,930 --> 01:34:58,170
Look at this abomination.

2314
01:34:58,430 --> 01:35:03,050
Look at this abomination.

2315
01:35:03,050 --> 01:35:04,890
No not that music.

2316
01:35:05,170 --> 01:35:07,310
Okay the full video was so...

2317
01:35:07,310 --> 01:35:08,370
It was like...

2318
01:35:08,370 --> 01:35:09,950
This is like basically a...

2319
01:35:09,950 --> 01:35:11,590
Super cut of that video.

2320
01:35:11,590 --> 01:35:14,750
I think the messed up part was...

2321
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:15,650
When they were...

2322
01:35:15,650 --> 01:35:17,250
They wore the fucking mask.

2323
01:35:19,150 --> 01:35:25,450
Oh my god.

2324
01:35:25,870 --> 01:35:27,870
When they wore the fucking...

2325
01:35:27,870 --> 01:35:29,370
Mask and everything.

2326
01:35:29,430 --> 01:35:31,590
I think that was the worst part.

2327
01:35:34,490 --> 01:35:35,650
We say...

2328
01:35:35,650 --> 01:35:36,490
Progress.

2329
01:35:37,090 --> 01:35:39,730
If Furby was released in 2030...

2330
01:35:39,730 --> 01:35:40,790
Instead of 1998...

2331
01:35:41,590 --> 01:35:42,310
The...

2332
01:35:42,310 --> 01:35:43,630
He's broke.

2333
01:35:44,350 --> 01:35:45,230
Technology.

2334
01:35:47,410 --> 01:35:49,050
That's what it was.

2335
01:35:49,370 --> 01:35:50,770
Chat you wouldn't understand.

2336
01:35:51,390 --> 01:35:53,090
We're progressing forward.

2337
01:35:53,210 --> 01:35:55,130
Not backwards guys.

2338
01:35:55,610 --> 01:35:57,710
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2339
01:35:57,810 --> 01:35:59,690
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2340
01:36:00,510 --> 01:36:01,390
Um...

2341
01:36:01,390 --> 01:36:03,090
Anyway.

2342
01:36:03,230 --> 01:36:04,410
Oh my gosh.

2343
01:36:06,090 --> 01:36:07,250
It's been...

2344
01:36:07,250 --> 01:36:09,150
Super fucking fun.

2345
01:36:09,330 --> 01:36:11,350
I'm really enjoying...

2346
01:36:11,590 --> 01:36:12,590
I'm definitely...

2347
01:36:12,590 --> 01:36:14,190
Really enjoying...

2348
01:36:14,190 --> 01:36:15,750
These night time gaps.

2349
01:36:16,090 --> 01:36:17,670
I hope you guys have been enjoying it too.

2350
01:36:17,930 --> 01:36:20,150
I've been enjoying just listening to me talk about...

2351
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:21,630
Random things...

2352
01:36:21,630 --> 01:36:22,050
Tonight.

2353
01:36:22,510 --> 01:36:24,010
And I hope that...

2354
01:36:24,010 --> 01:36:26,910
I hope that I didn't ruin your sleep by sending that video.

2355
01:36:27,190 --> 01:36:28,570
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2356
01:36:31,530 --> 01:36:32,730
I hope...

2357
01:36:32,730 --> 01:36:35,150
I hope I haven't been ruining your sleep.

2358
01:36:35,410 --> 01:36:38,350
Because I ended up sending the Furby video.

2359
01:36:38,630 --> 01:36:39,330
And like...

2360
01:36:39,330 --> 01:36:40,230
Doki no.

2361
01:36:40,530 --> 01:36:42,510
We were gonna be like...

2362
01:36:42,510 --> 01:36:43,210
Okay.

2363
01:36:43,330 --> 01:36:46,750
We were heading the right direction Doki.

2364
01:36:47,030 --> 01:36:49,730
Now we're 50 steps behind now.

2365
01:36:50,030 --> 01:36:51,350
I'm never gonna sleep.

2366
01:36:51,930 --> 01:36:52,830
I'm sorry.

2367
01:36:53,270 --> 01:36:54,110
But like...

2368
01:36:54,110 --> 01:36:54,870
Okay.

2369
01:36:55,930 --> 01:36:57,530

2373
01:37:04,550 --> 01:37:04,990

01:37:40,690 --> 01:37:42,350
And I'm gonna mute this.

2391

2402
01:38:03,770 --> 01:38:04,310

2403
01:38:04,990 --> 01:38:06,930
Instead of ending the night with Furby.

2404
01:38:07,310 --> 01:38:09,100
I'm gonna end the night with Crash Bandicoot.

2405
01:38:15,710 --> 01:38:17,450

2406
01:38:17,550 --> 01:38:18,310

01:38:18,910 --> 01:38:20,150

I don't know why.

2437
01:39:55,770 --> 01:39:58,410
I think I'm so special.

2438
01:39:58,830 --> 01:39:58,990
I think.

2439
01:40:00,830 --> 01:40:02,830
There's something wrong with me.

2440
01:40:03,730 --> 01:40:04,290
Whao.

2441
01:40:05,170 --> 01:40:06,690

Exactly.

2447
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:17,290
I was definitely very special.

2448
01:40:17,650 --> 01:40:19,850
I don't know why I was quoting this video.

2449
01:40:20,110 --> 01:40:22,830
But I was quoting this video for some reason.

2450
01:40:26,650 --> 01:40:27,170
Whao.

2451
01:40:30,700 --> 01:40:31,220

Posture check.

2460
01:40:43,900 --> 01:40:45,960
