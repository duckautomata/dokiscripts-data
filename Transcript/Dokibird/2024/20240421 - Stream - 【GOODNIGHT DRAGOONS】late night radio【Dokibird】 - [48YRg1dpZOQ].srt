00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,120
Hello, everybody.

2
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,740
Look at my lo-fi in.

3
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,440
Give me a sec.

4
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,680
Now it's actual late night radio.

5
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:03,880
Hello, everyone.

6
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,360
I hope the music isn't too loud, though.

7
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,980
Let me... I'll turn down a little bit just in case.

8
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,260
Oh, so this is gonna be...

9
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:11,620
Hello.

10
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,340
Hello, hello, guys.

11
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,640
So for those who are new here, what is Good Night Dragoons?

12
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,620
Good Night Dragoons is just gonna be like...

13
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:29,660
i want to do this like i'm gonna try and do this like once
every week um maybe like every saturday or friday um and

14
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:36,740
it's basically like a chill late night session because i
always see a lot of vtubers that do like morning radio shows

15
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:43,340
or like morning streams and it'll be like like like you know
like like more like oh hey this is the first thing you

16
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,440
listen to in the morning um i'm not a

17
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,680
As we all know, I'm not a morning person at all.

18
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,060
I'm mostly a night person, a night hour.

19
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,680
So I was like, you know what?

20
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,900
I'll be better than a good morning radio show, a good night
radio show.

21
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,960
Because at least I'll be awake.

22
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,060
So usually I'll just do this before I sleep.

23
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,740
Or like, you know, most likely, I don't know.

24
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,280
Sometimes I might be going to bed after the stream.

25
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,520
Maybe not because I do have a lot of work to do.

26
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,760
I've been procrastinating.

27
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:31,760
I've been like taking a lot more naps than usual And because
of that, I'm so behind on a lot of things I'm so, I'm so

28
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:45,100
behind I have like so many things to do behind the scenes at
the moment And I'm like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh But that's

29
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:52,140
basically it It's basically just like a late night Like I
guess you can call it like a late night podcast Oh my gosh,

30
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:57,620
speaking of that, okay, this is a little already off topic,
but like, I don't know if you guys, there's been like a new

31
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:04,820
trend at the moment where, um, also I guess like the stream
is also good for those who are on the other side of the

32
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:09,040
world, and you guys don't have to wake up super early for me
anymore.

33
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:16,060
Um, well, for not, not anymore, but like at least once a
week, you guys have this afternoon slash a little bit of the

34
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,800
morning radio show for you guys on the other side of the
world.

35
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,800
Because, like, I usually rarely stream at these type of
hours.

36
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:24,920
But I want to do this.

37
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Like, I want to try and be, like, super consistent.

38
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,280
I'm not going to do this every day.

39
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,280
Because I don't have the stamina for that.

40
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,340
And, like, I...

41
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:34,580
I...

42
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,900
Guys, I need time to do other stuff, too.

43
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:39,460
So...

44
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,260
So, this is just going to be, like, maybe I'll try to do
this, like, every Saturday.

45
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,100
Every Saturday at the same time, like, 9 p.m.

46
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:54,720
pst unless there's something that's happening on saturday
i'm gonna try to make this like super consistent on having

47
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:03,300
this every saturday um and i chose saturday because um i see
it as like you know the weekend type deal for people in na

48
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:11,060
so like because i know like you know nine it's it's one and
yeah was it it's like midnight for the easties over there

49
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:19,380
it's midnight for the easties over there so like you have an
excuse to stay up for a little bit longer you stay up for a

50
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:27,620
little bit longer for the stream and um and uh and it's also
like not too early for those on the other side of the world

51
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:34,780
and not too because i wanted to be like the perfect balance
well it's not perfect but like a good balance between like

52
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:43,500
you know uh people in na and people on the other side of the
world And I'm very sorry to the EU goons though People in SA

53
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:51,140
too I'm really sorry for the EU goons though Because like EU
goons ain't fucking faring so well lately

64
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:27,180
so um the past like I think the past like three plus days

I've been working a lot lately so my energy level has been
like a lot lower than usual um and like oh my gosh I during

that collab uh with juna brie and kai uh my brain was so
fried because i just woke up from a nap and i don't know why

68
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:09,040

69
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:18,100
before like before the stream and then like they were all
like talking a lot in the in the call and I was just like

70
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:27,140
yeah I felt so awkward before this stream because I was
still waking up so my brain was just like oh because like

71
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:33,800
they all know each other I didn't I didn't really I was like
the new person in the group um so I was just like oh gosh I

72
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:45,320
feel awkward oh my gosh my brain to like interact with
people my interest introvert self is like slowly waking up i

73
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,660
felt less clever during the collab i felt like oh my gosh i
was really watching the collab and i was like oh my god if i

74
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:58,160
was more awake i would have said this instead i would have
been i've been like oh i would have like role played more if

75
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,040
i was more awake i would have been like you know we were
making the jokes about the elderly i would like said why

76
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,500
don't you visit me in the retirement I would have said shit
like that.

77
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,680
I was like, oh my god, Doki, if you were more awake, you
would have been so much more clever in this collab.

78
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,800
You would have said more funny thing.

79
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,760
I was like, Doki, why are you just being reactive?

80
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,960
You would have been so clever if you were more awake, Doki.

81
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,860
Lord Kurosus, thank you for the Akasupa.

82

Thank you, thank you.

83
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,000
I learned that taking naps are worth this.

84
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:45,400
middle school i've been exhausted ever since thank you for
the akasupa thank you thank you i let my clippers down what

85
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:52,100
would they clip from me now i'm glad you guys still like to
collab i always want to try it like i always like want to

86
00:09:52,100 --> 00:10:00,940
like improve myself in content creation so uh i was just
like oh my god i could have said this i could have said that

87
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:07,900
but yes i do rewatch my vods just to like Be like okay, what
can not like not like critique my my commentary skills.

88
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,060
I'm not gonna critique my commentary, but it's just like
technical wise I rewatch my VODs for technical wise and also

89
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,440
like sometimes I'm like whoa, I'm actually really funny

90
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:23,350
And then I re like I rewatch my VODs.

91
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:33,650
I was like wow I'm actually really funny I don't be like I
can't believe I came up with that But like I don't know like

92
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:38,330
today I will watch the collab I was like oh my god I could
have been funnier.

93
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,510
Oh my god today.

94
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:47,570
I was like today I actually was like oh my god if I said
that it would have been so fucking funny Why didn't I say

95
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:48,150
that?

96
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:58,530
Because like you know how it's like I was a demon and we're
joking about the bachelor party I could have been like wow

97
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:08,070
who ordered a number Boucher Wow, I could have said that I
was like I was like, oh my God, I set up the perfect joke

98
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:12,650
about the bachelor party, and I didn't go full circle.

99
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:16,350
A wig, Doki, would have went full circle.

100
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:24,290
I had the perfect setup, Doki.

101
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,950
You had the perfect setup.

102
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,570
You could have went with it.

103
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,530
Because I kept, like, what else, a demon?

104
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:42,270
I kept like, you know, doing that attack where, you know,
doing that attack where you're like, it's like you're

105
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,610
basically like the bachelor party type deal.

106
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,390
I was like, I can't believe it.

107
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,650
I set up the perfect joke for this and I didn't.

108
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,170
There was no payoff.

109
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,110
I threw.

110
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,630
I fucking threw.

111
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:00,690
It would have been such a, it would have been so good.

112
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:17,110
um anyway yeah my brain actually my my brain was like not
awake it like started like slowly booted up the comedy

113
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:28,130
sector of my brain was not fucking on at that time i need to
remind myself to not take naps i i not like okay to not take

114
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:38,590
naps before a stream because i swear to i feel like i feel
like i'm just like not i realize i'm not as funny if i

115
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,770
taking that before the stream

116
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:52,710
i was like i was like oh my god i'm definitely funnier if i
just don't take a nap before the stream

117
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:04,590
and i definitely i need to remind myself not to do it i need
to remind myself not to nap before streams because uh my

118
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:14,770
brain just doesn't have enough time to boot up uh boot up
and be active and actually like and actually like create

119
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:25,570
content because I'm like still so like Ligarthic and stuff
like that um anyway also oh yeah uh I I got distracted a

120
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:36,710
little bit but um I was also inspired i was also like uh
inspired by it's the newest trend right now it's like a

121
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:46,370
newest trend in content creating where uh content creators
are uh are making these like new channels new channels where

122
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:55,240
they edit the their vods in a way they make compilation and
they edit the in a way where it's like uh videos you put

123
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:02,180
before you start like videos you put before you sleep type
deal like white noise have you guys seen that lately i've

124
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:09,660
been like okay wait there's this channel i've been like play
it showed up on my recommended uh recently and it's been

125
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:15,820
like uh so oh my gosh let me see if i can find it it's been
showing up in my recommended i've been like watching it

126
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:22,980
regularly like whenever i before like when i'm like heading
to bed i just put it on my phone and um just play in the

127
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:31,900
background uh just to like help me sleep because it's like
white noise um i'm trying to figure out remember like what

128
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:39,240
channel it was it was like showing up in my recommended a
lot yeah sleep channels so um it's basically like a lot of

129
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:47,720
like content creators now recently are making channels
dedicated to like uh giving me like editing the vods in a

130
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:56,780
way And they basically, like, mute and lower all the loud
sounds on those videos.

131
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:03,900
And then, uh, they, they, like, mute and, like, lower the
sounds and remove all the screams and everything.

132
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,140
And so, like, you can put in, it's, like, the same video.

133
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,560
It's almost the same video.

134
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:13,400
Just, like, you can put it in a background and you want to,
like, wake up to it, like, stuff like that.

135
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:23,000
Um, I'm trying to, like, remember which channel it was that
kept playing, um, I kept getting recommended of, uh, that's

136
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,300
basically your old vibe.

137
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,620
Uh, also, Dala, uh, Dala, thank you for the magenta soup.

138
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,140
Thank you.

139
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:30,720
Thank you.

140
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:30,840
Thank you.

141
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,600
Finish watching your stream tips video.

142
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,000
Here's the tuition I can spare.

143
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,260
Just wondering though, should there be a personal Twitch to
watch others and a work Twitch to stream as?

144
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,440
Thank you for the content.

145
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,020
Uh, no, because why?

146
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:41,400
Why?

147
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,100
There's no point in having separate Twitch channels unless
you want to be like incognito.

148
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't have separate Twitch channels.

149
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,020
Um, I usually just use one.

150
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:56,760
So, uh, so honestly, like, there's no need to, unless you
want to be, like, secret about who you watch.

151
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,520
But even then, you just get, like, BTTV.

152
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:08,520
I think that's, that is, yeah, if you get BTTV, you can, um,
you can, there's, like, anonymous mode where it logs you out

153
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,720
of the Twitch chat.

154
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:14,680
It logs you out of the Twitch chat, so, like, they can't,
people can't track who you're watching.

155
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:22,820
Uh, but obviously it's only available on, it's only
available on, like, PC uh, it's not there's it doesn't exist

156
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,380
on mobile.

157
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:31,120
So like I usually never watch streams on my phone anymore
Because like I've noticed I've noticed people have been like

158
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,520
stalking who I watch

159
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:46,360
And then people would like at me in the chat and would be
like whoa dokey's here So so I just I just watch on PC

160
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:55,540
because I just watch on my PC because I have the I have the
plugin that like puts me in anonymous mode So people can't

161
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,880
like look in the chat list to find me

162
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:05,960
Yeah, yeah Just like, I was like, oh, well, that's awkward

it wasn't just, I never had, like, a favorite Sanrio

196
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:21,200
character until, until I, until I saw Sinemoro.

197
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,080
Uh, wait, there's music?

I'll turn it up a little bit.

200
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:36,740
Alright, so I've never had a, I've never had a favorite
Sanrio character until Sinemoro came into, uh, came into the

201
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,160
picture.

202
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:46,580
Um, and the thing is, uh, um, before then it was there used
to be I don't know if it's still around I don't know if it's

203
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:54,660
still around um but there was this other it was a Korean I
think it was Korean store um it was like good night bear I

204
00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:03,400
think that's what is that what he's called good night bear
no it's that's not him it's that blue bear blue bear is it

205
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,000
Korean oh it's literally blue bear oh my god

206
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,520
Bear.

207
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,140
Okay.

208
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:19,240
So, um, so basically, uh, there was this, there was these
stores going around.

209
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,740
I don't know if they're still, I don't think they're popular
anymore.

210
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:27,300
I honestly don't think they're popular anymore, um, in NA.

211
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,540
I knew they were like, they were super fucking popular back
then when I was growing up.

212
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,480
But I think the company was called like Morning Glory.

213
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:46,600
And, um, I used to, like my mom used to buy me a lot of
like, like the mascot characters from the like from the

214
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:52,120
store and I used to be like obsessed with Morning Glory.

215
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,660
There was this other one I saw somebody like I retweeted it
too there was like the Korean bunny I'm trying to remember

216
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:10,980
the Korean bunny like like he's like not I'm not talking
about Mollong I'm talking about the OG Korean bunny does I

217
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:17,940
remember I retweeted the someone to an artwork of it like a
parody the oh no not Molan that's like that's like current

218
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:31,980
Korean bunny but there was like the OG is it mashie oh yes
yes it's mashie motto okay I was fucking obsessed with uh

219
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:42,680
mashie mashie motto and a blue bear that's the that was the
original original Korean bunny.

220
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:48,660
Now everybody knows about Mulan, but Mashimaro was the OG.

221
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,440
The OG Korean bunny.

222
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,400
Marty, thank you for the Akasupa.

223
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,720
Thank you, thank you.

224
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:04,400
Sincere person who sleeps 17 out of 24 hours, I need advice
on how to sleep quickly when my brain doesn't want to stop.

225
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,120
Thank you.

226
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,860
Okay, thank you, thank you.

227
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,440
Straight up, put white noise.

228
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,900
This is how I fall asleep.

229
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:17,860
I just put white noise of any youtube video um usually the
best ones are like podcasts or like someone you know there

230
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:27,400
it's just non-stop yapping so i'll just like um just play
like any youtube video or like twitch streams or anything

231
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:34,440
you can do music as well music doesn't work as well for me
when i sleep so i just put like uh podcasts or like

232
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:43,380
commentary videos or i used to sleep to apex streams back
then um now i just put on like random long videos like it

233
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:51,560
has to be super long too like maybe like 20 plus minutes i
choose a video between 20 plus to an hour so like uh you

234
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:59,820
know if i wake up the video will still be going um and uh
and it really helps a lot with falling asleep and like i

235
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:06,620
can't really like and also like when you're putting these
videos they're talking a lot too They're talking a lot so

236
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:11,440
like your brain doesn't think about like, you know, anything
else in your thoughts You're just thinking about like you're

237
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:18,500
just your brain is just focused on the white noise that's
playing around That's playing on your phone and and honestly

238
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:30,100
like I have no idea what any of the videos talk about Like I
have zero memory of any of the videos that play when I go to

239
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:34,280
sleep I it just like my brain just deletes all of that
information

240
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:50,540
but that's basically how it helps me go to sleep too um uh
but yeah anyway as i was saying the old uh before sanrio uh

241
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:56,560
i my mom would buy me a lot of this like from the morning
glory company like the stores there used to be so many of

242
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:05,520
the stores uh where i used to live and uh and i would have
like i don't think they're like as popular anymore i think

243
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:11,340
they got replaced by a lot like similar stores but it's not
morning glory anymore but i always have like a lot of

244
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:20,500
stationary a lot of like pencil oh you know like those lead
pencils where oh my gosh okay it's okay it's like i don't

245
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:28,820
know people still use these but as a kid um instead of lead
pencils it's like they're like little capsules wait i'm

246
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:34,840
gonna get a picture i can show the picture on screen um oh i
wish i know what it was called but they're like little

247
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:43,040
capsules and then you after you finish using them you plug
it out and then you put it on the top and then and then like

248
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:49,240
you know and then another capsule will come out the guy does
anyone remember those they used to be so popular for

249
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:56,800
children yeah they used to yeah they used to be like
incredibly popular for kids i don't think people use them

250
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:03,760
anymore because they realized it was so what's the word it
was very environmentally unfriendly.

251
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,040
It was incredibly wasteful.

252
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,700
I'm pretty sure.

253
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,480
I'm pretty sure.

254
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,160
Because, like, you know, after you finish using them, you
can't do anything anymore.

255
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,100
So, I'm pretty sure.

256
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,820
Also a choking hazard.

257
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,500
You're right.

258
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,380
It was most definitely a choking hazard.

259
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,420
But kids loved it.

260
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:40,760
um um but i honestly i don't know what it was called i just
remember i would there was like i used to use those because

261
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:47,840
like that's what my mom bought for me uh before i went
before i started using lead pencil um they were pretty fun

262
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:55,740
though uh more balls thank you for the super chat thank you

Yeah, yeah.

271
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:18,820
I'm pretty sure, like, because it was definitely, like, a
chokinheiser and also not very good for the environment,

272
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,780
that it definitely quickly died out.

273
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:33,580
Like, it's definitely, people realize, like, oh that is not
very safe for kids we should uh we should stop we should

stop making them stacking pencils okay let me see yes yes

yeah I learned that I don't it must be a new rule because I

332
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:26,120
was I would never get hit in the and I like swore so much I
used to never get hit by the limited ad shit in the past so

333
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:32,480
they must have recently changed the algorithm or something I
just hate that I hate it because obviously I don't get the

334
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:42,080
ad revenue I don't get the ad revenue for like the first
couple of hours because they hit me with the limited ads and

335
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:48,980
because of that and like people usually watch the vibe you
know like after the stream ends People would watch the VOD

336
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,580
instantly.

337
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,800
So it's like, no!

338
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:52,740

00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:56,960
YouTube!

340
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,980
Yeah, the most important hours!

341
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,040
No!

342
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,440
Um, but it was there before.

343
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,300
No, that's the thing.

344
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,200
Um, on my previous channel, I rarely have ever get hit with
limited ads.

345
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,760
It only happens.

346
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:24,840
when uh i usually only get striked by like music stuff and
it was i would never get striked for this is like it's been

347
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:29,640
the first time it's been the first time i've been like
getting striked for profanity uh which has been very

348
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:40,480
surprising d2h thank you for the akasupa thank you thank you
honestly i could figure out what to say it was bouncing

349
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:48,880
between a genuine question or a dn joke but i can't do that
to my kami oshi just answer Thank you for the Akasuka.

350
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:49,740
Thank you.

351
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:50,500
Thank you.

352
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,480
Depends on, like, which Metro series?

353
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:58,400
I might try Metro at a later time.

354
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,020
I think, like, I stopped because, like, I think I...

355
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,180
I don't know why I stopped.

356
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,540
I think it's because, like, there was too long...

357
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,540
It was too long of a break in between.

358
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,700
So, like, I just stopped playing it.

359
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,980
I think I'm going to try and find a Metro game.

360
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:21,860
I might start on a Metro game that was considered because I
don't think I actually I don't think I like enjoyed the one

361
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:29,780
I played I don't even remember the which one I played on
stream I actually I actually don't remember I don't think I

362
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:36,820
enjoyed that one um as much as I would have liked it I I
mean as much as I I don't think I enjoyed it as much as I

363
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:44,680
would have liked so I feel like I should try a fine I should
try and start one that I that was considered like um like

364
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:51,520
universal appeal a lot of a lot of people are asking me
because talked about Fallout um it's really good I highly

365
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:59,200
recommend checking out the fall I feel Fallout show I feel
like we're in a generation where like gamers are now making

366
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:09,420
the shows for like video game adaptations um and I feel like
we're at a point where we have people who actually play

367
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:23,840
video games making good adaptations of a video like of like
um like of video games and um okay the halo series okay we

368
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:32,640
don't mention the halo series because the halo series was
literally made by a group of creators who don't even who

369
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:44,420
don't even like play video games they literally don't care
about halo the writers never played halo the only exception

370
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:53,720
the only i think like last of us because the create i think
the creators of last of us the creators of last of us

371
00:38:53,720 --> 00:39:00,940
actually played the game but they told the actors to not
play the game but the the creators and the writers and the

372
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:07,500
producers they know the story of last of us and they
actually play the game but they told the actors they're like

373
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:15,480
no do not play the game we want you to act without any of
the knowledge of what's going on in the video game um and um

374
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:24,760
but they were still pretty faithful to the last of us game
um um but yet i think like the halo the people in halo they

375
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:37,320
did not know what the fuck was going on twisted meta okay
twisted meta like there's no not gonna lie i don't i don't

376
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:49,040
think the video game has much lore like it was the game was
just about like people in cars like each other up in cars so

377
00:39:49,040 --> 00:40:00,240
like i i feel like the game itself didn't really have a lot
of lore to build off of so i was so surprised that

378
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:10,340
i was i was so surprised that the show actually like did
something

379
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:26,360
what do you mean as what what's the lore what's the lore I
feel like okay like like I meant like more like I've only

380
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:36,980
played one twisted metal game but also I was like super
fucking young um and I feel like I feel like the people like

381
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:45,260
okay if you look at the other games the really A lot of the
game, a lot of them had like, a lot of people like know

382
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,700
about the lore of these games.

383
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,280
Like Fallout has an extensive lore.

384
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,700
Last of Us has an extensive lore and story.

385
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,580
But like, Twisted Metal.

386
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:03,460
All I remember about Twisted Metal was that clown and then
Cars.

387
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,180
And then they made a whole entire story based off of like...

388
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,600
a car i was like okay

389
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:31,520
um um but yeah anyway uh i highly recommend like i feel like
the meme about like oh video game video game adaptations is

390
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:38,740
like almost non-existent anymore um because there's been
more there's been more like home runs than there is duds in

391
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:48,880
general and i honestly feel like i honestly feel time where
people actually know how to make good video game adaptations

392
00:41:48,880 --> 00:42:04,800
um because they're running out of sequels to do there people
are tired of fucking superhero films and uh people are tired

393
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:16,120
of superhero films and people are tired of sequels video
game adaptations it's their next niche we're at an era video

394
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,020
game adaptations now.

395
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,600
Honestly, it's true.

396
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:20,640
It's true.

397
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,580
It's not about superheroes anymore.

398
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,920
It's all about video game adaptations now.

399
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,060
We're at the new stage.

400
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,160
A new era.

401
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:33,580
What's that word called?

402
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:38,080
You know, like the next peak of the next peak of cinema?

403
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,660
Fuck, what's that word called?

404
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,260
I forgot what it called.

405
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,060
My English is deteriorating.

406
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:55,500
The next mainstream thing it's the next mainstream act and
we're getting warhammer 2 the next era we have the next meta

407
00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:05,220
yes it's the next meta no more superhero meta we're in the
video game meta now i think it's also because we have the

408
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:14,140
graphics we have this we have the ability to do cgi now of
like actual video game cgi so i mean okay here like all

409
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:24,240
right the good ones there was fallout there's last of us um
the witcher until like they fired half the writing crew the

410
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:34,080
writers um yeah until they fired some of the writing crew
and also henry cabez um arcane um what else there's so many

411
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:46,680
sonic was pretty good too sonic mario um the witcher was
good until it wasn't all right guys the Witcher was good

412
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,300
until it wasn't.

413
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,380
You can't blame them, Cyberpunk.

414
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,880
There's been so many actual decent ones.

415
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,480
Okay, Detective Pikachu was pretty fun, yes.

416
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,280
Detective Pikachu was pretty fun.

417
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,120
Only because of Ryan Reynolds.

418
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:08,360
If it wasn't for Ryan Reynolds, I think the movie would have
been pretty shit.

419
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,240
Not gonna lie.

420
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:11,620
Not gonna lie.

421
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,400
Ryan Reynolds is the only reason why...

422
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:24,920
and Pikachu was as good as it is because if you take Ryan
Reynolds out the other actors were so bad no offense to the

423
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:36,440
other actors but they were not as memorable or as good um

when you when you click one article and then you click on

474
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:43,580
the next article and then you click on the next article so
like i was like

475
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:53,560
that's so interesting because like I love the lore behind
Fallout because I thought it was like it's just very

476
00:47:53,560 --> 00:48:03,460
interesting to read and like if you guys don't know the lore
of like the vaults each vault um each vault has like a

477
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:11,700
different experiment going on so I was curious I was like oh
what is this vault's like science experiment so they'll like

478
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:17,840
do like a social experiment with each vault like with each
vault and the vault is where like they put all the people in

479
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:24,120
there and stuff like that and then i was like oh okay i want
to know what the vault what their the social experiment is

480
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:30,060
or like the science experiment is going on in that vault
like in the vault we're looking at and then so i got into a

481
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:40,280
whole fucking rabbit hole of of of the show so i sort of
know how it i i sort of know how the show ends but like i'm

482
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:49,440
on episode two um There's like, so like, if you guys don't
know about the vault lore, there's one vault where it's just

483
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,460
filled with clones named Gary.

484
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,040
And all they say is Gary.

485
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,040
And, and, um, there's another vault.

486
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:06,400
There's a, oh, I know you guys are curious about this vault.

487
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,880
You must be like, what's in vault 69?

488
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:13,480
It's, they basically in vault 69 is one guy.

489
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:28,030
all women that's what's involved 69 real this is actually
real lord by the way i'm not making the up like that's

490
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:37,130
actually what's involved 69 um they knew of course they know
every fucking gamer is a 10 year old inside okay no not 10

491
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:49,610
year old that's the wrong age puberty 14 okay every every
gamer game developer is a 14 14-year-old It has a

492
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:51,590
14-year-old inside.

493
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:52,210
Sorry.

494
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:55,730
I had to think about What age do people hit puberty?

495
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:58,010
I was like 10 is not the right age.

496
00:49:58,390 --> 00:49:59,590
10 to 14 is much better

497
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:13,890
The the inner 14-year-old But yes, and then I think this
those were the most like ridiculous ones for me.

498
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:23,250
I think there was one where I'm trying to remember there was
like another vault where I'm trying to remember there was

499
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:30,350
like one vault where it was like one guy and then it's all
puppets so they want to see like how insane like will they

500
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:42,110
be able to function as a human being with no socialization
except for the puppets and obviously the answer is no yeah

501
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:47,530
no they that person was not okay Um, the puppet man.

502
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:49,050
Yeah, the puppet man.

503
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:51,110
So, um...

504
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,670
Wait, did Penny Arcade actually write that one?

505
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:57,030
Wait, Penny Arcade?

506
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:58,790
Oh my god, that's a name I...

507
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:03,290

How... Holy shit!

511
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:16,090
The creators of Penny Arcade is almost in his...

Bro, I'm so sad.

517
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:54,170
Cyanide and happiness.

518
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:59,830
They still make really good content, but because they're,
like, super old now, people don't watch cyanide and

519
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:00,630
happiness anymore.

520
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:04,250
I still, like, I still, like, watch it ever so often.

521
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:08,770
Like, there'd be, like, gaps in between before I, like,
watch cyanide and happiness again.

522
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:14,390
Um, and, uh, the creators of cyanide and happiness, he's
sturdy.

523
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:15,530
Okay, not as old.

524
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:17,710
Not as old, though.

525
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:18,450
Not as old.

526
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:19,170
36.

527
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:20,590
That's pretty good.

528
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:24,390
36 to 39.

529
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:25,530
That's decent.

530
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:26,290
That's pretty good.

531
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:28,010
It makes you feel less old now.

532
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:31,230

I remember Fusion Fall.

548
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:15,390
I never got a chance to play Fusion Fall.

549
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:16,830
I don't know why.

550
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:21,110
I think I was just too stupid on the internet to know how to
play Fusion Fall.

551
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:22,710
Mega Tokyo.

552
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:24,130
Bro, Mega Tokyo.

553
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:26,410
Guess it was a scam.

00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:32,450
Do they still exist?

555
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:33,750

00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:36,550
Wait, not Mega Tokyo.

558
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:37,130
What was it?

559
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:37,730
Not Mega Tokyo.

560
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:38,390
What was it?

561
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:39,430
The Tokyo Pop?

562
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:40,990
No, not Mega Tokyo.

563
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:41,910
What was it?

564
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:42,570
Is it Tokyo?

565
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:43,670
It was like some...

566
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:45,270
Well, not...

567
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:46,290
Was it...

568
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:47,890
The publication.

569
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:49,530
Was it not?

570
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:49,930
It was not...

571
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:50,970
I'm not talking about Mega Tokyo.

572
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:53,290
It was like a book publication.

573
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:54,830
The comic books.

574
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:58,510
Before, who were like...

575
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:01,050
I'm not talking about Mega Tokyo.

576
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:02,410
I'm talking about like...

577
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:03,530
Is it Tokyo Pop?

578
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:04,690
Oh, yeah.

579
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:06,090
I don't know if they're better now.

580
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:09,590
But like, I heard Tokyo Pop used to have like...

581
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:12,870
really bad like illustrator contracts.

582
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:14,910
I think, I don't know, they're better now.

583
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:19,310
But like, I remember there was like, like several, like
there's publisher.

584
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:20,450
Yeah, the publisher.

585
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:32,110
I remember back then, the publisher had like really bad like
contracts and everything for like artists and translators

586
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:32,970
back then.

587
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:39,650
Like people were, people were making, not twit longers, but
like a tweeter, twit, sorry, not twit.

588
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:40,490
Twitter.

589
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:42,810
Twitter was not a thing yet.

590
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:50,690
So people were making like the DeviantArt and Tumblr
equivalent of twitline guys about Tokyo Pop.

591
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:56,610
Yeah.

592
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:02,150
And then, um, and then, yeah, the angry bloggers.

593
00:56:02,410 --> 00:56:10,110
They live, they were, there was like live journals, Tumblr
posts and DeviantArt journal blog posts about Tokyo Pop

594
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:18,850
because apparently they paid really little um in terms of
translations and it wasn't like super accurate but the thing

595
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:28,150
is they had so many license and I think at one point they
went bankrupt so like it took off like majority of the

596
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:38,990
English um the English translations of uh tokyo pop manga's
so like majority of like because like they own they had a

597
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:47,990
they almost had a monopoly for like manga and i think they
went bankrupt and at one point and they they had to like uh

598
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:55,110
they had to like take down majority of like you know they
went bankrupt so they had to basically a lot of manga was

599
00:56:55,110 --> 00:57:05,510
like taken out because of it and i and apparently they're
still around So they must have got better They must have got

600
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:14,830
better I remember people were like Whoa Yeah They almost
killed the whole scene Because they literally had the

601
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:23,190
monopoly They had the monopoly Of manga For like the NA side
Because like it was the only way to read like NA manga Like

602

famous one was um the ever after tournament with endling
hosting it and oh with the Climber.

612
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:55,190
I used to love the Climber.

613
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,550
Like, I was so obsessed with the Climber.

614
00:58:57,930 --> 00:59:00,090
The Climber was my K-pop stat.

615
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:06,330
The Climber was my BTS.

616
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:15,830
All the women loved the Climber.

617
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:19,710
Was it Climber?

618
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:22,930
He must not wait, maybe I'm thinking of it wrong.

619
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:24,470
What was his actual name?

620
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:29,430
Is his name actually climber?

621
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:31,210
I might be remembering it wrong too.

622
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:33,110
Endling tournament.

623
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:37,110
Ever ever after tournament.

624
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:39,150
Okay, was it ever after?

625
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:40,310
Okay, endling.

626
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:42,070
Oh my god, it's so long.

627
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:44,210
What did he climb?

628
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:48,390
I was, no, you don't understand.

629
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:52,930
It was Oh my god, it's so old that like, oh my god.

630
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:57,010
Was it, what was his, oh my god, okay, end zone.

631
00:59:57,410 --> 00:59:58,830
Okay, it was called the end zone.

632
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:00,650
Okay, who was, who were competitors?

633
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:02,130
Was he actually called Climb?

634
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:03,030
Yes, he was!

635
01:00:03,310 --> 01:00:04,910
He was called the Climbor!

636
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:08,330
Okay, I was getting paranoid and was like, am I forgetting
it wrong?

637
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:10,790
Because all the animation was made in Flash.

638
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:13,850
Okay, but that shit, I love the lore.

639
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:14,950
I'm so sad.

640
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:23,610
The guy, the creator of, the creator of Climbor, He fucking
disappeared because he got a real job too.

641
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:25,390
So, god damn it.

642
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:30,630
Why do they all keep getting real jobs?

643
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:41,610
But that shit was so good.

644
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:42,330
Oh my gosh.

645
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:47,410
I was like obsessed with like the lore behind this, the
climber.

646
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:54,390
And like the ad, okay, like you might think watch rewatching
because i rewatched animations recently because it's on

647
01:00:54,390 --> 01:01:04,450
flash like it was on flash but somebody saved the animation
um uh saved the animations and stuff uh on youtube and i was

648
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:12,190
rewatching it and i was like oh the voice acting was not as
good as i remembered it i had i had those rose tinted

649
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:20,930
glasses on it was not as it was not as like pretty as i
remember The fight scenes, though.

650
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:23,430
The fight scenes were still pretty fucking good.

651
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:24,790
I have to admit.

652
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:29,370
Like, the fight scenes were actually pretty fucking insane,
though.

653
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:31,650
Even if, like, um...

654
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:34,890
Even if, like, the voice acting wasn't as good.

655
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:38,870
I think back then, because a lot of them were also, like,
Newgrounds creators.

656
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:47,330
I would say, like, Newgrounds creators are incredibly good
at fight scenes and fight choreographies.

657
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:53,230

Um, but yes.

Also, like, oh, there was another creator, really.

693
01:06:08,550 --> 01:06:19,570
Oh my gosh It was like Oh my god I used to admire so many
artists Uh Back then too So It's like crazy Going back

695
01:06:30,350 --> 01:06:42,690
stuff I don't want to expose my show Ha ha ha there was
there was this other artist that i used to like i really

696
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:55,590
like their art of but like i'm worried that like i'm i'm
like honestly worried about what what they are now because

697
01:06:55,590 --> 01:07:05,250
oh my god okay because i know what happened to one of the
creators and like what pathway they went to so i'm so

698
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:16,650
embarrassed but there was this artist that was known okay
it's gonna be okay it's so fucked oh my god like when i read

699
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:27,910
like like as i got older and then as i as i got older and
then like i realized like you know they got older too and

700
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:39,790
then okay i won't name any I won't name names, but back then
on Demon Art, um, this was for Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.

701
01:07:40,770 --> 01:07:44,650
Um, yes, okay, okay, some people are like, know where it's
gonna go.

702
01:07:44,990 --> 01:07:52,510
So, like, there used to be, like, really popular things
with, like, Animal Crossing and Mystery Dungeon, and, like,

703
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:55,770
Pokemon, Pokemon, and Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, and stuff
like that.

704
01:07:55,970 --> 01:07:57,850
And there would be, like, roleplay groups.

705
01:07:58,170 --> 01:08:00,810
So, like, people would draw comics and stuff with, like,
OCs.

706
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:05,490
So, one was the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Roleplay Group.

707
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:16,070
And let's just say, um, the main creator of the roleplay
group definitely went a different direction afterwards.

708
01:08:24,150 --> 01:08:31,050
And I remember, it used to be so cute.

709
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:34,450
It used to be, like, so cute.

710
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:41,570
And the lore was so interesting but then money talks

711
01:08:46,170 --> 01:09:08,450
no it's not pokemon anymore let's just let's just say um
money definitely talks and um it's definitely uh It was not

712
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:12,110
about cute Pokemon Mr. Dungeon missions anymore.

713
01:09:13,030 --> 01:09:17,470
And I just remembered, because I used to follow this artist.

714
01:09:17,970 --> 01:09:19,750
Because I really liked their art.

715
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:21,330
Because it was so cute.

716
01:09:21,730 --> 01:09:24,110
And the story was so interesting.

717
01:09:24,790 --> 01:09:27,350
And then it went a different direction.

718
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:33,210
I won't say the name.

719
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:37,230
But for anyone that ever followed the DeviantArt.

720
01:09:37,330 --> 01:09:46,410
Pokemon Mystery Dungeon role-play groups like the most
famous one would know exactly who I'm talking about like

721
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:57,750
they They they would know because they were like one of the
they were the most famous Pokemon Mystery Dungeon like

722
01:09:57,750 --> 01:10:11,090
artists back then and and it went a different direction half
a couple of years later I I can't name it like it's like

723
01:10:11,090 --> 01:10:18,970
they still do they still make content so I can't say
anything it's just you know when people get older I guess

724
01:10:18,970 --> 01:10:27,270
they figured you know they got bills to play and everything
I understand they get they have bills to pay there's a

725

Everyone was too young back then.

767
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:24,780
But then they realized this dark side of money.

768
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:27,060

Thank you.

773
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:41,510
yeah also the more i talk about this the more i realized i
was way too young to be like reading or watching any of

774
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:51,450
these things by the way i should have never been allowed on
the internet the thing is i didn't even start on the

775
01:14:51,450 --> 01:15:00,570
internet really young i wasn't allowed to be on the internet
um for a long time until like i was i wasn't allowed to be

776
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:08,630
on the internet until like Like I'd even have, like I wasn't
even allowed to have like a Facebook account when like

777
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:11,570
people were, people, everybody made Facebook accounts.

778
01:15:12,150 --> 01:15:18,810
And like one of my friends had to make a Facebook account
for me because I had no idea about Facebook.

779
01:15:19,470 --> 01:15:24,630
And then all I did, I think when I was finally allowed to be
on the internet, all I did was play Neopets.

780
01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:32,190
I, I, all I did, I literally, I was just like, yay.

It was basically pre-Tumblr.

818
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:16,040
And there was like a lot of like anime communities on there.

819
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:22,000
I would use LiveJournal to like take the icons for like
anime shows.

01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:24,040
Like some of my favorite anime shows.

821

I was part of the Glee Live Journal community.

823
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:40,040
I, okay, I would admit I would take some of the animated
icons from the Oran High School Host Club Live Journal

824
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:44,380
community and the Glee one to put on my MSN icon.

826
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:49,660
Anyway.

827
01:19:51,900 --> 01:20:01,060
Anyway, as I was saying, um there was like this live journal
role play community where like people will role play as like

828
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:09,860
different characters from different uh from different
fandoms so like it was like a fucking mixed mash of like

829
01:20:09,860 --> 01:20:18,020
it'll be like the team fortress 2 sniper meeting i don't
know meeting hikaru from oran high school host club and it

830
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:25,800
would be like the most insane role play session ever Like
there would be like so much lore in it and then it was all

831
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:36,720
public So then I would like read the roleplay sessions of
like random fucking Characters talking to each other and I

859
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,200
Generalness of it all.

But, yeah.

863
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:39,980
Anyway, that was, like, my...

864
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:41,320
My internet history.

865
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:42,160
That was...

866
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:43,780
That was literally my internet history.

867
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:45,260
growing up.

868
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,520
It was a wild internet history.

869
01:23:47,740 --> 01:23:54,960
I should have never, I should have not been on those sites
with how young I was.

870
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:59,780
I should have 100% not been on any of those sites for sure.

871
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:08,260
I need you guys to know when I started out my internet
history, I was like playing Neopets, right?

872
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:10,320
I even had to, I was so naive.

873
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:13,760
I didn't lie about my age when I started out Neopets.

874
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:24,680
to the point where like my my parents had to fax the neopets
headquarters proof that I had parental permission to access

875
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:35,500
the um the more restricted areas of neopets and you guys are
like the restricted areas of neopets what are those it was

876
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:44,040
basically the forms like um the neobords because like I
didn't lie about my age so I wasn't allowed to talk to

877
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:51,800
anybody online or like use the neo mail or anything so they
had to like they're like oh if you're under age and you want

878
01:24:51,800 --> 01:25:03,440
to access the neo boards you have to fax um you have to fax
in your parents parental permission like a permission slip

879
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:07,780
so you can like access the neo boards and talk to the adults
so

880
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:22,240
I had to get that happened because I wanted to like I would
be like I want to talk to strangers on the internet I was

881
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:28,880
like mom I want to talk to the straight okay I didn't tell
her she didn't they didn't know they didn't know that it

882
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:34,780
ended up being I talked to random strangers on the internet
but like because like it was just they're like just like

883
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:42,280
access to things so they didn't realize at that time it
basically led to me Knowing more about the internet because

884
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:45,780
you know, I started talking to fucking adults on the
internet

885
01:25:49,470 --> 01:25:59,590
I definitely should not have been Because like a lot because
like you guys didn't know back then neopets was like um Was

886
01:25:59,590 --> 01:26:11,950
mostly for adults and for college students like and I was
definitely neither of them So so there was a lot of like It

887
01:26:11,950 --> 01:26:18,730
was like, I remembered, I talked about the story before, but
like, there was a help section, there was a help section,

888
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:28,110
and, um, and, like, in the Neo Boards, and I was, like,
really scared, because I was like, oh my god, I'm gonna, um,

889
01:26:28,190 --> 01:26:35,130
I don't know, I think I was like, oh my gosh, I'm gonna, I'm
gonna go to middle school for the first time, and I'm really

890
01:26:35,130 --> 01:26:45,410
scared, and I was like, I don't know, what is middle school
gonna be like, I'm so scared, and then some some adult was

891
01:26:45,410 --> 01:26:56,890
like the help section is for like was for is for neopets
related issues but don't worry 6th grade is not that

892
01:26:56,890 --> 01:27:13,670
difficult this is not the right board to talk about this
This is where like neopets related help issues like but

893
01:27:13,670 --> 01:27:21,230
reporting bugs or like needing help regarding neopet issues
I like my dumb ass was like, please help.

894
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:24,010
I'm really scared about sixth grade.

895
01:27:24,470 --> 01:27:25,950
What am I should I expect?

896
01:27:31,190 --> 01:27:37,470
No, it was just one person there were several people and
they're like oh do not worry about male school It's high

897
01:27:37,470 --> 01:27:39,330
school you have to worry about

898
01:27:43,510 --> 01:27:55,670
oh my god oh it was so it was so embarrassing thinking back
to it oh they're like no trauma dumping child mom this is

899
01:27:55,670 --> 01:28:04,310
new pets man and then i told the story in the roblox stream
but like i also there was like role play role play board on

900
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:14,730
neopets and because i wasn't a high schooler it's funny
because i i swear to god i'm pretty sure majority of the

901
01:28:14,730 --> 01:28:24,250
people that were in the high school role play has never been
the high school before because i was just some middle school

902
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:32,230
role playing as a high school student like in those high
school boards we're like i'm like i was like oh i'm in like

903
01:28:32,230 --> 01:28:46,970
10th i'm a sophomore and and i because they're like
imagining what high school could be for us just just faking

904
01:28:46,970 --> 01:28:51,770
it so like there'll be like roleplay boards where you're
pretending you're high school students and then there's like

905
01:28:51,770 --> 01:29:00,050
multiple versions of it it's like high school but like what
if we're like we all have powers so like mutants like x-men

906
01:29:00,050 --> 01:29:13,610
high school roleplay or like or like um magical school high
school roleplay role play or a superhero high school role

907
01:29:13,610 --> 01:29:14,510
play.

908
01:29:16,490 --> 01:29:25,710
And then I would have like word documents, like word
documents I made on Microsoft Word of like character sheets

909
01:29:25,710 --> 01:29:30,470
of like all these different like high schoolers, plus
warrior cats by the way.

910
01:29:30,530 --> 01:29:40,530
I would have high schoolers and warrior cats with like
established character sheets and um powers and i'll be like

911
01:29:40,530 --> 01:29:48,190
and then i would have like my intro pre-written um my intro
pre-written and everything so i could just copy and paste it

912
01:29:48,190 --> 01:29:58,690
as a as it like to start the story of my character and it
would be like i wish i still have it so i could like cringe

913
01:29:58,690 --> 01:30:05,470
at it i really It was, oh my god, I really do wish I still,
I still have it.

914
01:30:05,990 --> 01:30:09,730
Oh, it's so fucking cringe, thinking back.

915
01:30:10,330 --> 01:30:11,530
Oh my god.

916
01:30:13,270 --> 01:30:14,330
I did that in Gaia Online.

917
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:17,230
The thing is, I was way too young for Gaia Online.

918
01:30:17,690 --> 01:30:20,750
So like, Neal Pets was like the baby version of that.

919
01:30:22,530 --> 01:30:24,610
The cringe is overwhelming.

920
01:30:25,150 --> 01:30:27,910
I was way too young to use Gaia Online.

921
01:30:28,190 --> 01:30:29,570
So like, there was a baby.

922
01:30:29,650 --> 01:30:43,910
baby version for me for me this is giving me emotional
damage that wasn't prepared for oh and now i'm illiterate i

923
01:30:43,910 --> 01:30:56,190
feel like i think i hit my peak um i definitely hit my peak
in terms of intelligence and writing um during that stage

924
01:30:56,190 --> 01:31:07,690
and neopets and then everything else was downhill from there
like i i wrote a lot for neopets roleplay and then as i got

925
01:31:07,690 --> 01:31:15,130
older i realized i i definitely got more and more stupid and
illiterate the older i got

926
01:31:20,210 --> 01:31:28,630
oh my god holy i've been yapping for so long already i was
already an hour and 30 minutes?

927
01:31:29,090 --> 01:31:30,370
Oh my god.

928
01:31:33,170 --> 01:31:34,130
What did I miss?

929
01:31:34,230 --> 01:31:37,310
You missed cringe dokey internet history.

930
01:31:37,970 --> 01:31:40,650
It was pretty fucking cringe back then.

931
01:31:40,990 --> 01:31:42,650
But who else wasn't like cringe?

932
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:44,570
But everybody was cringe back then.

933
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:48,170
Everybody was like super cringe back then.

934
01:31:48,210 --> 01:31:49,190
Because we didn't know better.

935
01:31:50,110 --> 01:31:52,750
I definitely should not have been talking to adults for
sure.

936
01:31:53,050 --> 01:31:55,670
But like at the age I was.

937
01:31:56,530 --> 01:32:00,050
I'm so we did not know what was safe for kids

938
01:32:03,430 --> 01:32:12,650
People back then did not realize that it was sort of a bad
idea that we had like little dot a little dokey at talking

939
01:32:12,650 --> 01:32:14,610
to fucking college students

940
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:23,640
Oh, I'm just thinking like I don't know why did they talk to
me

941
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:41,120
oh my god um um but yeah but it's from neopets because of
the boards on the neopet boards it led to me discovering

942
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:50,120
deviant art and then from deviant art it led to me
discovering like other stuff on the internet like from

943
01:32:50,120 --> 01:33:03,480
deviant art to fanfiction.net to tumblr and to live the
moment the moment my parents faxed that parental permission

944
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:12,440
slip it was over for me it was so over i sped run my
internet cloud like i'm not into a cloud i sped run my

945
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:24,540
internet like uh intake i learned things on the internet at
an exponential rate because of that all because My parents

946
01:33:24,540 --> 01:33:35,600
faxed in that parental permission slip and it went downhill
in the pipeline Neopets to new grounds that was not the way

947
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:51,880
it should go but But it did it fucking did oh my god oh my
god I also had like uh Wait let me see if I can uh find it I

948
01:33:51,880 --> 01:34:06,940
