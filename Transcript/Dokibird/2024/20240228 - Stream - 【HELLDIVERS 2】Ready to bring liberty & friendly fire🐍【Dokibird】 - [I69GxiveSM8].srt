We got the same experience.

299
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,000
It's just because you're level one.

300
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,620

00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,480
No, I have four grenades.

503
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,540
There's grenades in the fucking area.

504
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,120
I have a lot of grenades.

505
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:16,880
Wonderful.

506
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,500
That's what he means, more grenades.

507
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,200
There we go.

508
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,340
No way.

509
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,320
You shoot his leg twice at railgun, and then it breaks the
armor, then you just shoot the leg until he dies.

510
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,080
How come Zeller gets to have a railgun, and I can't?

511
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,720
You can have a railgun here.

512
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,060
Can I?

513
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:32,860
There you go.

514
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:36,600
Yay!

515
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,520
I got fed!

516
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:48,180
Also, I'll just, I'll have you both know you both stole that
railgun from me and the roller dog and you will die

517
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,620
eventually when I have enough.

518
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,760
Do you want one too?

519
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,800
I want a rubber dog.

520
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,600
Do you want some ammo?

521
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,580

That's what you're doing.

534
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,840
Hell yeah, you know it.

535
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,220
You know what she did.

536

What the fuck?

537
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,840
What are you guys talking about?

538
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,060
You didn't do anything.

539
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,180
You survived.

540
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,220
Here, Zeller, take this.

541
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:12,600
Okay?

542
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,280

00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,200
You can have this auto cannon.

Look, Zeller, look, look, look.

546
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,440

Go click those buttons guys.

561
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,260
We need more civilians.

562
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,020
Civilians.

563
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:28,980
Where do we press?

564
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:29,980
What do we do?

565
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,880
I love killing civilians.

566
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:32,860
It's okay.

567
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,800
It's okay.

568
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,100
Don't kill the civilians.

569
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,120
They're not real people anyway.

570
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,040
Yeah.

571
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,760
What about a leg shot?

572
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,020
What about a leg shot?

573
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,260
Hey, how about a headshot for you?

574
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:45,720
You won't.

575
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,560
What if I railgun you?

576
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,320
What do we just slap him?

577
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,200
We should slap him.

578
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,420
Yeah, I am innocent.

579
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,460
He can just heal up.

580
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,900
We have unlimited reinforcements, remember?

581
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,380
Are you running?

582
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,280

583
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,120

00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,660

00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,640

RPR is super citizen.

Come to me.

596
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:24,460

Alright.

Where are you?

599
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,500
Dang, these turrets are broken.

600
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,700
Yeah, don't stand in front of it.

601
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,940
No, no, no, no!

602
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:33,300

603
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,340
What did you do that?

604
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,580
What the fuck is wrong with you?

605
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,500
What did you do that?

606
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,660
Why did you do that?

607
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,480
Why did you do that?

608
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:45,720
Why did you do that?

609
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:51,220
Wait, I broke my neck because he passed me in the air.

610
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,660
Bro, did you see how far I flew?

611
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,380
Holy shit, man.

612
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,240
I flew.

613
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,580
Bro, where are we?

614
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:04,600
By the way, the next person who dies can't come back for two
minutes.

615
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,380
So use that information as you will.

616
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:07,840
You hear that, Zora?

617
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,580
Stop killing people, man.

618
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,020
Use that information as you will.

619
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,700
Let's go extract.

620
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,400
Why do we extract?

621
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,280
Yeah, just...

622
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,000
Yeah, there's a giant bug following us from behind.

623
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,120
He's just...

624
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:24,540
Not anymore.

625
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,280
He's still there.

626
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:26,900
What do you mean?

627
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:30,740
He's dead.

628
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:31,420
Nice.

629
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:32,860
All right, guys.

630
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,440
Let's actually extract because we have no lives.

631
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,800
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

637
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,140
Hey, drop me like your friend.

638
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,000
Hey, yo, baby girl.

639
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,500
Hey, yo, what's up, baby girl?

640
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,740
Hey, yo, I found one of these.

641
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,600
Oh, God.

642
00:35:59,340 --> 00:35:59,640
Oh, God.

643
00:35:59,700 --> 00:35:59,980
No, no.

644
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,900
Like, I'll run into the monsters.

645
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,360
I'll run into the monsters with this.

646
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:05,740
Okay.

647
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,000
I will be the sacrifice.

648
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:07,480
All right.

649
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,520
We believe in you.

650
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:08,880
Just let me.

651
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,340
Just let me.

652
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,300
We have no lives.

653
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,660
No, no, no, we do.

654
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:12,960
We do.

655
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,540
We have one more.

656
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,580
We have one more.

657
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,240
I gotta like, I gotta get some- Wait, just a bug behind you,
just a bug behind you!

658
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,160
We'll do this, we'll do this!

659
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:20,920

660
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:21,800

What?

666
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,480
We're no sacrifice.

667
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,820
This is not fair.

668
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,020
Seller, thank you for sacrificing yourself for the con.

669
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,600

671
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,880
Hey, a bug's a bug!

672
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,660
Seller, a bug's a bug!

673
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,720
I can't believe it.

674
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:50,880
This is a scam.

675
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,420
Two seconds.

676
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,060
This is what you wanted though.

677
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,180
Thank you for your- you did your part, Zella.

678
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,220
You did your part.

679
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,020

00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,100
How are you guys spectating it?

755
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,000

00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,060
That's okay.

761
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:41,820

No, he died.

767
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,260
I have no idea how I died there.

768
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,240
I was so far behind my thing.

769
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,480
I'm on solo.

770
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,140
Bro, I guess we gotta kick him.

771
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,420
He didn't clutch.

772
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,460
He didn't clutch.

773
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:07,180
To be honest, like, Zeller kind of spent, like, 18 of our...

774
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,560
Yeah, I didn't do nothing.

775
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,980
Worth-wild sacrifice.

776
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,620
Let's see the stats and let the stats talk for himself.

777
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:25,680

779
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:39,540
your kick and he kicked himself he actually kicked himself
he's just taking a share he actually kicked himself he

780
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:43,260
couldn't use for him to go take Let's look at stats.

781
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,220
Let's see, let's see Zeller's stats.

782
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,800
Handed 4.1k.

783
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:51,500
Friendly spy.

784
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:53,820
We hunted 4,000.

785
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,740
Bro, hunted 4,000.

786
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,360
Look at my accuracy.

787
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:07,920
Yes, because I was, I had like the, I had the unfortunate
circumstances of being next to Zeller.

788
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:11,680
So that I got killed as well because I was right next to
Zeller.

789
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:23,280
well that's your fault wrong place wrong time dumbass bitch
that's your fault not mine how is that my fault you're right

790
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:29,600
I should never stand next to you I'm never standing next to
you again now I can kill her and she won't know it's me

791
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:39,000
because I'm far away what the fuck do you mean you're gonna
kill like Han and RPR if I stand next to them well I guess

792
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:46,100
that's that then Holy shit, how the fuck did Han do 4,000
friendly fire?

793
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:47,000
How?

794
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,280
I think he killed the Zellers like 15 times.

795
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,720
I only died 10 times, man.

796
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,720
It says here, I only died 10 times.

797
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,200
Wait, Han actually kicked himself out of the group too.

798
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,240
Wait, how are you back?

799
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,700
Han, you did 4,000 friendly fire damage, Han.

800
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:03,800
What the fuck?

801
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,140
He was so crazy.

01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:03,360
He is dead.

1141
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:04,640
What do you mean?

1142
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:06,040
I'll never die.

1143
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:07,260
He was dead.

1144
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,160
I was telling the truth.

1145
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,080
Oh, shit, guys.

1146
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:14,060
Okay, I'm going to get another machine gun.

1147
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:15,720
I'm on fire.

1148
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:16,140
What the fuck?

1149
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,300
Oh shit, there's more.

1150
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:19,100
I only have a pistol.

1151
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:20,020
I only have a pistol.

1152
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:21,760
I only have a pistol.

1153
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,440
Zellie, get away from me.

1154
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:27,040
I'm staying near you so you get the fucking damage.

1155
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,240
My machine gun is literally coming down.

1156
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,080
Yay.

1157
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:34,340

We're doing it.

1160
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:38,400
We have like four left, so we're five.

1161
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:39,640
Okay, I got another machine gun.

1162
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:40,480
Objective.

1163
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:41,780
We gotta go to objective.

1164
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:42,480
I got an orbital strike.

1165
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:43,280

Return to tactical zone.

1171
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:50,740
No, we have to return.

1172
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:51,920

I need more bullets, I need more bullets, I need more
bullets.

1194
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:53,880
I'm not going to lie.

1195
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:55,280
I gave up when you guys made the way.

1196
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:56,360
I just started running away.

1197
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:58,980
You're a horrible person.

1198
01:02:58,980 --> 01:02:59,600
How could you?

1199
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,760
You should revoke your super citizen.

1200
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:04,180
You're not a super citizen.

1201
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:05,320
You don't help others.

1202
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:08,320
Because instead of instead of.

1203
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:08,640

Instead of what?

1207
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:11,760
One second.

1208
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:12,760
I was throwing a nuclear bomb.

1209
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:16,740
Instead of fucking around with you guys, I'm liberating.

1210
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:17,600
I'm liberating.

1211
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,080
We're liberating too.

1212
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,300
Yeah, you're liberating your brain cells.

1213
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:22,880
What do you mean?

1214
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:24,200
We're liberating.

1215
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:25,920
We're doing our part.

1216
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:27,740
I'm doing my part.

1217
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:28,900
Yeah, I'm doing my part.

1218
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:32,300
I'm doing my part too, being happy.

1219
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:33,600
Like, we're here now.

01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:33,260
No, uh-uh.

1327
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:33,800
You shot me.

1328
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:34,940
I shot a robot.

1329
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:35,660
He's dead.

1330
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:36,640
I did my part.

1331
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:38,660
How much?

1332
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:40,040
44 seconds.

1333
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:41,320
RPR, you need to stop dying.

1334
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:42,680
We don't have enough grease on.

1335
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:44,620
That's 15 times.

1336
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:49,040
Look at us, RPRC.

1337
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:49,560
We're doing it.

1338
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:50,200
We are cooking.

1339
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:50,980
We are doing it.

1340
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:51,900
I'm grenade-ing.

1341
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:54,320
That's not a good grenade.

1342
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:55,140
You're going to kill us.

1343
01:07:55,860 --> 01:07:57,020
What do you mean?

1344
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:00,560
You nearly killed us on solo out here.

1345
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:02,960
I'm doing my best.

1346
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:05,440
Greeter shot first and Greeter's still key.

1347
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:06,000
I did it.

1348
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:10,020
I mean, you didn't die.

1349
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,140
You ran away.

1350
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:12,140
You didn't die.

1351
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:12,640
Whoa.

1352
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:13,740
Oh, my God.

1353
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:14,160
Oh, my God.

1354
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:17,920
I got shot by your fucking robot drone.

1355
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:18,280
Hey, guys.

1356
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:19,260
Five seconds, guys.

01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:23,740
Use the turret.

1360
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:24,140
Where are they?

1361
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:24,580
Where are they?

1362
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:26,260
Oh, I got it.

1363
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,320
I don't know how to use it correctly.

1364
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:29,080
I'm getting it.

1365
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,480
I don't know if there's any on this side.

1366
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:30,860
There is.

1367
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:31,040
There is.

1368
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:32,080
I got one guy.

1369
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:33,120
Nice.

1370
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:33,900
Oh, my God.

Yep, I'm just done with it.

01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:50,040
We just run.

1387
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:50,900
What do you mean we don't fly?

1388
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:52,260
White hair is from stress.

1389
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:53,320
He's already white hair.

1390
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:53,740
Jump!

1391
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:55,680
He's going to lose his hair after this.

1392
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:56,380
Just fall damage.

1393
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,540
I got the turret.

1394
01:09:59,040 --> 01:09:59,180
Oh!

1395
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:02,440
An explosion killed me.

1396
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:03,560
There's like...

1397
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:03,800
Oh!

1398
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,380
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1399
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:07,760
No, no.

1400
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:08,780
We just killed us.

1401
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:09,700
I don't know.

1402
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:10,400
An explosion.

1403
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:11,240
I don't know what happened.

1404
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:12,840
We just killed us.

1405
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:13,680
I don't know.

1406
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:15,280
An explosion.

1407
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:17,480
I think it was RPR's thingy.

1408
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:18,640
No, it wasn't.

1409
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:19,840
It was something from behind us.

1410
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:20,940
Yeah, something exploded.

1411
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,900
I got hit by it, too, but we're fine now.

1412
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:25,080
It's okay.

1413
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:25,680
Well, I'm not.

1414
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:26,240
I'm dead.

1415
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:27,000
We're fine.

1416
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:28,240
We have reinforcements.

1417
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:31,040
Reinforcement.

1418
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:32,720
We got rocketed from behind.

1419
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:34,440
He's going to rocketed us.

1420
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:35,280
It's Zeller.

1421
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:37,120
Oh, it's high.

1422
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:39,800
I didn't do that.

1423
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:42,420
He's so cheeky right now.

1424
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:43,640
It was hot.

1425
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:50,540
The moment he used that voice, that voice right there, you
know, you know.

1426
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,580
He used the voice.

1427
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:55,340
The world hates me.

1428
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:56,720
Maybe I'll hate the world.

1429
01:10:58,580 --> 01:11:00,720
He lived long enough to become a villain.

1430
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,560
Wait, you're looking for you now.

1431
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:07,700

01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:13,920
I'm so sad if RPR just chill yeah before he has no meds you

1453
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:20,940
I'm so sad if RPR dies while Zelen lived for as I ever lived
for so long.

1454
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,160
I'm not gonna die okay I'm a professional.

1455
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:27,120
That's a flag right there bro.

1456
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:36,400
Mother RPR is the type of guy who's gonna tell the fucking
dude next is like after this war let's go back happily to

1457
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:37,060
our family.

1458
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:38,880
See, he died!

1459
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:39,740

1460
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:41,640

He died, I told you!

1463
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:47,920
Holy shit!

1464
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:48,780

01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:51,540
That worked so hard for you to live!

1466
01:13:51,980 --> 01:13:52,900
What happened?

1467
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:57,220
That phrase, after this war, let's go back to it.

1468
01:13:57,780 --> 01:14:01,640
Maybe jigs myself a little bit, but you fucking fucked me

1474
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:46,740
Well, no, if it's Zeller, I don't really want to be the one
that's, like, I'm one day away from retirement.

1475
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:48,880
What the fuck is this bot drop?

01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:50,980
Why are they calling me a bot, bro?

1477
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:53,380
Zeller, like, do not land on Han.

1478
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,800
He worked so hard to get here.

1479
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:56,900
I'm a lie.

1480
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:02,020
Are you healed up?

1481
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:03,560
Yeah, yeah, he's healed up.

1482
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:04,880
He's good now.

1483
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:09,980
Just one minute and 36 seconds.

1484
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:11,620
Just keep going to extraction point.

1485
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:12,460
You're so close.

1486
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:14,940
Actually, don't even know.

1487
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:16,060
We still have to wait two minutes.

1488
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:20,500
It's not very good.

1489
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:22,360
You know what?

1490
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:23,100
It's so winnable.

1491
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:24,500
Maybe I don't need you anymore.

1492
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:25,340
No!

1493
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:28,980
Get some rid of it.

1494
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:30,800
Put him down old yellow style.

1495
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:34,400
Just like as the ship is dropping down, you're like, you
know what?

1496
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:36,060
This was a solo mission.

You were not doing good at all.

1529
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:25,780
You killed them.

It's okay.

1538
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,440

01:22:58,100 --> 01:22:58,400
I'm running away.

1656
01:22:58,400 --> 01:22:59,960
You have an orbital that you can shoot that thing away.

1657
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:00,480
Okay.

1661
01:23:06,660 --> 01:23:07,100
Uh...

01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:08,400

Oh, no!

1664
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,340
Oh, I missed people behind!

1665
01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:13,500
I'm going across the map.

1666
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:14,120
Holy crap.

1667
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:14,780
What happened?

1668
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:15,740
Oh, God.

1669
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:15,780
Oh, God.

1670
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:16,860
I got shot by the laser.

1671
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:18,120

1672
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:18,500

01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:20,800
I got tower too!

1674
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:22,140
Okay.

1675
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:23,640
RPR prove to us that you're the carry.

1676
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:24,400
Come on.

1677
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:25,520
Show us what you got.

1678
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:26,300
RPR.

1679
01:23:27,020 --> 01:23:27,220
RPR.

1680
01:23:27,380 --> 01:23:28,760
I don't really have much ammo.

1681
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:30,040
Reinforce me.

1682
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:32,660
Yeah, well, you got me if you reinforce me, yo.

1683
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:34,100
Can you land on the...

1684
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:36,660
You want me to go land on the guy?

1685
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:37,740
Land on the tower.

1686
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:38,620
Land on the tower.

1687
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:39,540
Land on the tower.

1688
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:44,080
Let's see if my aim is good enough to land on the tower,
bro.

1689
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:45,160
Don't land on me, please.

1690
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:46,480
Where the fuck?

1691
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,460
I can't, bro.

1692
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:48,360
This is impossible.

1693
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:49,400
Oh, shit.

1694
01:23:49,820 --> 01:23:50,160
Okay.

1695
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:52,360
He's got no aim and no bitches.

1696
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:54,400
Dude, I was so far away from the...

1697
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:54,560
All right.

1698
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:56,160
What about a grenade for the tower?

1699
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:57,060
No, no.

1700
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:57,800
That will not work.

1701
01:23:58,620 --> 01:23:59,000
Okay.

1702
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:00,660
It doesn't work.

1703
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:01,460
Yeah, I tried.

1704
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:04,460
Oh, he's shit.

1705
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:06,240
He's shit.

1706
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:07,500
Did he just sound shit?

1707
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:09,740
Oh, I'm burning, I'm burning, I'm burning.

1708
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:11,860
Heal yourself, heal, heal, heal.

1709
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:13,240
Heal, heal, heal.

1710
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:15,400
You're doing so well.

1711
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:16,700
You're doing so well, Seller.

1712
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:17,540
This is my last reload.

1713
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,120
Do you not have resupply?

1714
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:22,000
No, it's over there.

1715
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:22,520

01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,320
Where's the extraction point?

1724
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:39,520
Why aren't you guys going to extraction?

1725
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:40,940
We don't need these extra.

He's going to die to the tower.

1741
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:00,880
No, he's not.

1742
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:02,300
Just keep running.

1743
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:03,320
Run away from them.

1744
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:04,100
Get away.

1745
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:08,360
Run, even if we miss this, uh, Even if we miss this EVAC,
there's going to be an emergency one.

1746
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:10,160
So, just stay alive.

1747
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:10,620
Just stay.

1748
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:11,840
Well, we didn't finish the mission.

We did.

1750
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:14,860
We just need extraction.

1751
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:16,220
We just need extraction.

1752
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:18,680
20 seconds.

1753
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,580
20 seconds and you get Han Solo back.

1754
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:21,380
We're going to run out of bounds.

1755
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:22,300
We're going to run out of bounds.

1756
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:24,060
No, I hate this game.

1757
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:25,080
Why am I out of bounds?

1758
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:26,040
That's not out of bounds.

1759
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:29,280

01:52:10,450 --> 01:52:11,470
I don't think there is a turret.

2423
01:52:11,610 --> 01:52:12,530
It's an artillery thing.

2424
01:52:13,890 --> 01:52:14,910
How do we get rid of the artillery?

2425
01:52:15,430 --> 01:52:17,950
We got to find it and then explode it.

2426
01:52:18,210 --> 01:52:19,190
Or we could just leave.

2427
01:52:19,810 --> 01:52:20,190
Wait.

2428
01:52:20,770 --> 01:52:24,110
Well, I mean, yeah, but you know.

2429
01:52:24,130 --> 01:52:25,110
What's the fun, Dodd?

2430
01:52:26,230 --> 01:52:27,750
We have three more rebats.

2431
01:52:28,350 --> 01:52:28,750
Oh!

2432
01:52:29,250 --> 01:52:31,630
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2433
01:52:31,850 --> 01:52:32,250
No!

2434
01:52:33,250 --> 01:52:33,650
No!

2435
01:52:33,870 --> 01:52:34,170
No!

2436
01:52:40,310 --> 01:52:41,110
I am right here.

2437
01:52:42,670 --> 01:52:44,890
I am right here.

2438
01:52:46,210 --> 01:52:47,170
Wait, I can like, can I...

2439
01:52:47,170 --> 01:52:49,510
If I land on the robot, does it do damage?

2440
01:52:49,710 --> 01:52:50,930
Yeah, it kills it, it kills it.

2441
01:52:51,230 --> 01:52:51,670
I'll mark it.

2442
01:52:51,690 --> 01:52:52,110
Oh, it's dead.

2443
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:52,570
It's dead.

2444
01:52:54,450 --> 01:52:55,650
You're welcome, guys.

2445
01:52:56,310 --> 01:52:57,210
Hey, welcome on in.

2446
01:52:57,270 --> 01:52:58,910
For damage by me, chaps.

2447
01:53:01,710 --> 01:53:04,530
Guys, we have two reinforcements left, guys.

2448
01:53:04,870 --> 01:53:06,010
Okay, let's go to the objective.

2449
01:53:06,270 --> 01:53:06,690
Let's go here.

2450
01:53:06,910 --> 01:53:08,330
All right, all right, I'm following you, hon.

2451
01:53:09,670 --> 01:53:11,110
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

2452
01:53:11,490 --> 01:53:12,410
I see the artillery.

2453
01:53:12,750 --> 01:53:13,570
I'll get rid of your turret.

2454
01:53:13,750 --> 01:53:15,750
Yay, I believe in your RPR.

2455
01:53:15,910 --> 01:53:17,030
You can do this for us.

2456
01:53:17,690 --> 01:53:18,510
Oh, it's not that way?

2457
01:53:18,650 --> 01:53:19,510
Okay, I gotta go around.

2458
01:53:19,810 --> 01:53:21,410
Okay, I believe less than you now.

2459
01:53:22,190 --> 01:53:23,630
You still kind of believe in me, right?

2460
01:53:24,390 --> 01:53:28,410
Oh Wait, I thought you were I thought you were getting rid
of the artillery.

2461
01:53:28,690 --> 01:53:29,130
What's this?

2462
01:53:29,530 --> 01:53:30,610
What is this?

2463
01:53:31,390 --> 01:53:33,670
So many guys it sounds like Cossacks in this game.

2464
01:53:34,010 --> 01:53:34,350

We don't need a super siege.

2486
01:54:27,610 --> 01:54:27,810
We don't need a super siege.

2487
01:54:27,810 --> 01:54:28,630
We don't need a super siege.

2488
01:54:28,630 --> 01:54:29,770
There's an auto cannon in battle.

2489
01:54:29,770 --> 01:54:30,150

2571
01:57:53,930 --> 01:57:54,110

You guys are going to survive.

2583
01:58:10,930 --> 01:58:11,350
We're going to live.

2584
01:58:12,870 --> 01:58:13,850
I believe in us.

2585
01:58:18,670 --> 01:58:19,590
Oh, no, there's a shield.

2586
01:58:20,570 --> 01:58:20,850
Yeah.

2587
01:58:21,190 --> 01:58:22,150
I'm going to throw my nades.

2588
01:58:22,410 --> 01:58:22,530
I'm going to throw my nades.

2589
01:58:22,530 --> 01:58:23,070
I don't have nades.

2590
01:58:24,130 --> 01:58:25,190
I'm shooting him in the cross.

2591
01:58:27,070 --> 01:58:28,510
I'm jumping my nade.

2592
01:58:28,650 --> 01:58:29,250
I dropped the nade.

2593
01:58:29,290 --> 01:58:29,670
Ego.

2594
01:58:33,870 --> 01:58:35,010
That's so bad.

2595
01:58:36,550 --> 01:58:38,110
Run, run, run at Ego.

2596
01:58:38,550 --> 01:58:40,530
I'm trying my best to run.

It was the enemies.

2618
01:59:14,370 --> 01:59:15,150
It wasn't me.

2619
01:59:17,610 --> 01:59:19,210

Brothers in arms.

No, I'm not using it.

3268

02:35:24,580 --> 02:35:25,420

We're heading over.

3436
02:43:16,800 --> 02:43:18,020
I have no more stims.

3437
02:43:19,260 --> 02:43:20,840
I have two stims.

3438
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:21,240
I'm running over.

3439
02:43:24,800 --> 02:43:25,140
Okay.

3440
02:43:25,780 --> 02:43:26,940
Oh, no, I just saw a big guy.

3441
02:43:27,460 --> 02:43:27,940
I'm sorry, NET guys.

3442
02:43:29,440 --> 02:43:31,560
I'm way behind, guys, but I'm coming over.

3443
02:43:32,820 --> 02:43:33,840
All right, we'll look for you.

3444
02:43:34,740 --> 02:43:35,820
Oh, there's a big guy right after you.

3445
02:43:35,860 --> 02:43:36,680
Maybe I won't look for you.

3446
02:43:36,880 --> 02:43:37,040
Oh, shit.

3447
02:43:37,120 --> 02:43:37,380
Oh, shit.

3448
02:43:37,840 --> 02:43:38,060
Oh, shit.

3449
02:43:39,100 --> 02:43:41,120
If you walk over here, I'll get rid of him.

3450
02:43:42,400 --> 02:43:43,080
Guys, he's...

3451
02:43:43,080 --> 02:43:44,600
He's, like, blocking me.

3452
02:43:46,400 --> 02:43:47,060
It's okay.

3453
02:43:48,260 --> 02:43:48,820
Come up here!

3454
02:43:48,940 --> 02:43:49,360
Come up here.

3455
02:43:50,700 --> 02:43:51,500
No, the eagle!

3456
02:43:51,860 --> 02:43:52,580
No, no, no.

3457
02:43:52,680 --> 02:43:53,560
You threw a mate, Tom.

3458
02:43:53,940 --> 02:43:55,040
You threw a mate, Tom, on her.

3459
02:43:56,500 --> 02:43:57,940
This is the wall of fire.

3460
02:43:58,060 --> 02:43:58,920
Now they can't come over.

3461
02:43:59,100 --> 02:43:59,240
See?

3462
02:43:59,280 --> 02:43:59,740
I'm okay.

3463
02:44:00,080 --> 02:44:01,040
I planned that.

3464
02:44:01,060 --> 02:44:01,480
I planned that.

3465
02:44:01,600 --> 02:44:01,980
I planned that.

3466
02:44:02,660 --> 02:44:03,780
Look at how getting burned.

3467
02:44:04,760 --> 02:44:06,020
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3468
02:44:06,880 --> 02:44:08,380
Nothing bad happened to me.

3469
02:44:08,560 --> 02:44:09,240
I'm okay.

3470
02:44:10,540 --> 02:44:11,760
I don't think we got it in time.

3471
02:44:13,140 --> 02:44:15,160
Han, there's a lot of renexus.

3472
02:44:15,700 --> 02:44:16,240
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

3473
02:44:16,520 --> 02:44:16,840
All right.

3474
02:44:17,840 --> 02:44:19,400
Oh, there's some coming in right now.

3475
02:44:19,480 --> 02:44:20,680
I'm out of ammo, basically.

3476
02:44:23,160 --> 02:44:23,860
Thank you.

3477
02:44:24,060 --> 02:44:25,040
All right, I'm going to throw a galley.

3478
02:44:26,160 --> 02:44:26,700
Up, up, up.

3479
02:44:26,940 --> 02:44:27,960
Oh, my God.

3480
02:44:28,460 --> 02:44:29,420
They're doing their part.

3481
02:44:29,720 --> 02:44:31,220
We're all doing our part.

3482
02:44:32,880 --> 02:44:33,680
I'm through my galley.

3483
02:44:34,440 --> 02:44:34,960
Galley in.

3484
02:44:35,240 --> 02:44:36,680
Fuck, this guy's so tanky.

3485
02:44:36,760 --> 02:44:37,140
He's like...

3486
02:44:39,440 --> 02:44:39,880
RPR.

3487
02:44:40,020 --> 02:44:41,000
Oh, that's a big guy.

3488
02:44:41,040 --> 02:44:42,340
Big guy's over to our left.

3489
02:44:43,180 --> 02:44:43,720
Thank you.

3490
02:44:43,780 --> 02:44:44,760
I killed one of the...

3491
02:44:44,760 --> 02:44:46,300
Fuck, these guys are tanky.

3492
02:44:46,540 --> 02:44:47,940
We're gonna try and get the flying ones.

3493
02:44:49,680 --> 02:44:50,260
Where's the big guy?

3494
02:44:50,860 --> 02:44:52,980
Big guy is down, big guys down.

3495
02:44:53,840 --> 02:44:55,500
Oh no, never mind, there's another big guy.

3496
02:44:55,620 --> 02:44:56,000
What?

3497
02:44:57,060 --> 02:44:57,500
He's dead.

3498
02:44:57,900 --> 02:44:58,600
I'm stuck.

3499
02:44:59,000 --> 02:44:59,720
I'm flame throwing.

3500
02:45:02,240 --> 02:45:02,900
It's okay.

3501
02:45:03,060 --> 02:45:03,460
We're good.

3502
02:45:03,460 --> 02:45:03,720
We're good.

3503
02:45:03,820 --> 02:45:04,120
We're good.

3504
02:45:05,180 --> 02:45:05,580
Reloading.

3505
02:45:05,960 --> 02:45:07,120
There's another big guy.

3506
02:45:07,280 --> 02:45:07,660
Another big guy.

3507
02:45:08,020 --> 02:45:09,160
He's coming to me.

3508
02:45:09,880 --> 02:45:11,560
I'm shooting him in the van.

3509
02:45:11,560 --> 02:45:13,100
I'm shooting him.

3510
02:45:13,480 --> 02:45:14,700
He's burning.

3511
02:45:16,420 --> 02:45:17,060
He's breathing.

3512
02:45:17,680 --> 02:45:18,460
He's burning.

3513
02:45:19,960 --> 02:45:21,920
You hear the weird stuff.

3514
02:45:22,380 --> 02:45:22,660

3520
02:45:30,660 --> 02:45:31,340
I'm reloading.

3521
02:45:32,520 --> 02:45:34,140
I'm reloading.

3522
02:45:37,100 --> 02:45:37,940
It's okay.

3523
02:45:39,900 --> 02:45:40,580

3524
02:45:41,900 --> 02:45:42,860

3538
02:46:06,820 --> 02:46:08,800
We need to call them in, but there's a lot on us.

3539
02:46:09,020 --> 02:46:10,500
You know, the destroyers left orbit.
