1
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,460
Hello everybody!

2
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,900
Give me a sec, I was actually in the middle of writing an email.

3
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:54,640
I had to write an email to book an elevator to move in, the second move in, because like, one move in was not, one moving was not enough.

4
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:14,140
I had, well I wouldn't say I had too much stuff, but like, um, I, okay, I didn't tell you guys the story, but like, um, so I had like, so I figured, you know, I figured like, the internet stuff would take a very long time to do, because usually you, in the past,

5
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:25,280
you like, send people in, like you have to make an appointment to like a technician, and then the technician does like the thing, like you know, the beep boop boop bop bop, and then, I don't fucking know what they do.

6
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,560
They're like sci-fi to me.

7
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,180
Um, but basically, uh, so like, that's how, usually how it goes.

8
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:44,920
You make an appointment, and a technician comes in, and it's like, I'm gonna install the internet, and bring in the equipment, because I was like, oh, I don't know if, um, I don't know like, if I have the equipment for it.

9
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,420
So, that's how it's always been.

10
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:54,400
Um, so like, uh, so I was like, in a call with the lady, um, to be like, yeah, it never showed up.

11
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:02,240
When I registered for like, my ultra fiber, the 3000 upload download shit, like the appointment thing never showed up.

12
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,100
And I was super confused.

13
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,160
I was like, oh, maybe I just need to wait 24 hours.

14
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,280
So I waited 24 hours, but it still didn't show up.

15
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,320
So I was like, okay, that's weird.

16
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,240
Like, I'll just call them.

17
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:21,500
So I called them, and they were like, they're like, oh yeah, this was by the way, this was after the first move in.

18
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:28,480
So I kept my PC stuff at my old apartment, because I was like, okay, I'm gonna wait until all the, because I have like obligations to do, obviously.

19
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:35,140
Like, so I was like, alright, I'm gonna, I'm gonna like wait.

20
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:40,320
I'm gonna wait until, I'm gonna wait until like, my internet's installed, and then, and I'll move the PC over.

21
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:52,720
And so what I found out in the call, um, was that, uh, she was like, there, there's the, the equipment's in the building, in your room.

22
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,380
Like, in the, your, in your apartment.

23
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,060
And I was like, what?

24
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,920
Like, this is when I was like, at the old apartment.

25
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,120
So I was like, what do you mean?

26
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,840
I was like, how is that possible?

27
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,520
Like, I am literally the first tenant.

28
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,680
Like, there has, it has, because it, there hasn't been like, any other tenant before me.

29
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,340
I'm literally the first one.

30
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,540
No one has lived in this, in this apartment, except for me.

31
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:32,960
So like, um, so the lady was like, no, no, no, there, there is, there, there, it says in our files that there is, there is like, uh, there is internet already installed.

32
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,120
And I was like, like, it's already activated.

33
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,660
Because you already paid for it.

34
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,660
I was like, what?

35
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:49,320
So, for those who don't know, and I was so stupid, because like, by the time, like, I got all this call over, the movers had already left.

36
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,940
So like, I couldn't be like, hey, by the way, go grab my fucking desk.

37
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:58,120
Because the movers, by the time I did that call, um, the movers already left.

38
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,140
So, um, because like, the, we did two calls.

39
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:08,060
The first call, they said it was, like, it was there, but you gotta check, because like, we're not, if you're not sure, we don't know.

40
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,420
Because I was, I was at my old apartment, getting ready to move my stuff, and like, moving everything but my desk.

41
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:20,040
And then, when, by the time I got there, got to the new, because then they're like, okay, when you get to your new place, call, we'll call you.

42
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,180
Uh, we're gonna call you at this time.

43
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,960
And then, like, you can check.

44
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,920
So like, apparently, it was like, in some fucking, it was in like, a closet.

45
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,460
And like, there's like, a panel in a closet.

46
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,120
That, and when I opened it.

47
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,760
All the internet stuff was already connected.

48
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:42,360
Because new buildings, new buildings, have fiber already installed automatically.

49
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:49,060
Which was, I had a, it's crazy for me, because like, I didn't grow up with that.

50
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:56,840
Like, like, every building, every new building, the last couple of years, have already has like, fiber installed.

51
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,080
So like, you don't have to deal with that.

52
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,140
Like, you literally only just have to like, activate it.

53
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,920
Like, online.

54
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,500
And then you get internet.

55
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,700
Like, I was like, holy shit.

56
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,480
We don't need hover cars.

57
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,020
We just need the internet.

58
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:10,820
Like...

59
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,880
Like, the future is, who the fuck needs internet?

60
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,400
Like, who the fuck needs hover cars?

61
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:25,180
When I have fiber internet automatically installed in the apartment.

62
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,640
Um...

63
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,240
But yeah, like, I like, found it.

64
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,240
Because they're like, it's there.

65
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,040
So I was like, looking around the apartment.

66
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,560
I was like, where?

67
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,900
And it was like, a fucking panel hidden in like, one of the closets.

68
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,140
And like, I opened it and it was just cables and internet.

69
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,160
And like, I just needed to connect it.

70
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,060
I was like, because it's already activated.

71
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,420
So like, all I needed was like, the pa...

72
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:47,720
Like, the...

73
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,380
The...

74
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:48,980
The...

75
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:54,120
The machine itself has like, the password and like, the name of the internet.

76
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,060
Like, thing.

77
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,740
And then, so I was just like, oh my god.

78
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,880
That's fucking crazy.

79
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,200
Anyway.

80
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,520
So, yeah.

81
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,700
I need to do two...

82
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,040
I need to do two move-ins now.

83
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,820
Because, um...

84
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,360
Because like, I have to fucking...

85
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,540
I have to fucking move my work desk over there.

86
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,440
So I have to book the elevator for the move-in.

87
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,420
To be sure.

88
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,380
Because like, last time I lied.

89
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,440
And they were like, oh, we don't want...

90
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,040
Because I was like, I can't go back.

91
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,120
Like, what am I going to do with all my moving equipment?

92
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,480
Because I can't go back.

93
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,680
So like, I don't want to do that again.

94
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,620
Because like...

95
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,920
I don't know if like...

96
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,900
I don't know if like, the other concierge...

97
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,580
Um...

98
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,340
Yes, I have like, a concierge.

99
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,900
No, it's not just the desk.

100
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,840
It's also a lot of like, clothes too.

101
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,240
I didn't finish packing up my clothes.

102
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,540
Because I was just like...

103
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,080
I just brought like, a bunch of clothes.

104
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,540
And then like...

105
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:47,980
Um...

106
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,280
But then I didn't bring my...

107
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,160
Rest of my clothes.

108
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,760
So I need to come back to move the clothes as well.

109
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:53,680
Um...

110
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,560
But yes, it's very...

111
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,560
Very expensive.

112
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,140
Uh...

113
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,900
Not a great time.

114
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,620
Which comes to my wallet.

115
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,520
Um...

116
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,080
And so like...

117
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,520
I have to email the concierge.

118
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,680
I like having...

119
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,000
Uh...

120
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,720
Well, it's like the lobby people.

121
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,080
Because it's more like, safety wise.

122
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,200
Um...

123
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,000
It's sort of like, safety wise for it.

124
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:19,780
Um...

125
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,080
I'll tell the story of why.

126
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:21,940
I like...

127
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,080
I like having...

128
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,300
Like, I like renting apartments with like, a lobby person.

129
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,260
I'll tell you what...

130
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:30,480
Why.

131
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:30,600
Why.

132
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,280
Like, when I fully...

133
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,220
When I fully like, move out...

134
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,600
There's like a...

135
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,120
There's like a funny story to it.

136
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:40,840
So...

137
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,140
Um...

138
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,700
But only when I fully move out.

139
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,000
Because then I can be like, well I don't live there anymore.

140
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,440
So I can talk about the story.

141
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,360
But...

142
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,020
Well wait.

143
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:48,300
Wait.

144
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,440
Wait until next week.

145
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,320
And I'll tell you the story of why I prefer that.

146
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,140
Like...

147
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,180
Um...

148
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,300
Alright, let's seemingly finish writing my email.

149
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,020
Real quick.

150
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:03,300
Alright, I need to make sure I don't read this email out loud too.

151
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,180
Alright, I'm almost done guys.

152
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,860
Alright, there you go.

153
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,460
Alright, I don't want to accidentally dox myself again.

154
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,200
Alright!

155
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,100
Also, another issue, why we were looping.

156
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,280
I did a little white lie.

157
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,700
I didn't actually use the bathroom.

158
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:40,700
But I didn't want you guys to judge me during the loading stream, during the intro.

159
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,200
It's a little white lie, okay?

160
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,260
It's a little white lie.

161
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,920
But basically...

162
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,740
Basically, I'm very stupid.

163
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:58,260
And apparently, I didn't pack my controller because I was like, Oh, what if I play a game that I know?

164
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,140
A game where I need to use my controller?

165
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,200
So I was like, okay, I'm going to make sure I don't pack my controller.

166
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,080
What I didn't realize is...

167
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,960
I packed my controller cable.

168
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,960
Because I put all the cables in one bag.

169
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,740
I was like, cable, cable, cable, into the Ziploc bag you go!

170
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,540
And I put it in the box.

171
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:23,660
So...

172
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,760
I didn't pack the controller!

173
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,140
But I packed the controller cable!

174
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,580
So I was trying to find another cable.

175
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,260
I don't even know if it'll work because I haven't tested it out yet.

176
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,280
But essentially, what the setup is currently...

177
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:46,180
Is that I found my PlayStation 5 controller cable.

178
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,740
And I Frankensteined it onto my Xbox controller.

179
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,940
So I don't know if it's going to work.

180
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,520
Because like, I don't know.

181
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,460
It's just cables.

182
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,580
Just like how you guys said, it's just RAM.

183
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,660
So like...

184
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,260
So we'll see how it goes.

185
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,920
I haven't tested it out yet.

186
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,640
Also on another note...

187
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,680
I feel really bad for...

188
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,300
For...

189
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,680
For Salt.

190
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,160
Pour one out for Salt.

191
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,080
Because he went fucking viral.

192
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,920
I did not...

193
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,160
I didn't expect that to happen!

194
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,940
And like overnight...

195
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,200
Overnight from one single like PC stress test stream.

196
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,020
Like if my PC curse wasn't so...

197
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:44,520
Wasn't so bad, we would never have this moment at all.

198
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,680
This...

199
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,580
This like...

200
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,660
Like one...

201
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,280
One of a million time moment where...

202
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,140
Everything has led to my boy Salt...

203
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,060
Getting rejected.

204
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,800
In sort of almost 4000 views.

205
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,950
Has hit one million views.

206
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:09,890
And I'm like...

207
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:10,250
Oh...

208
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,670
Pour one out for Salt, man.

209
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:21,330
Content gods are looking after you.

210
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,950
Black, thank you for the super chat.

211
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:23,990
Thank you, thank you.

212
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,170
I might have...

213
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,390
Like a million PC issues.

214
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,670
But at least I can still make content.

215
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:34,430
Um...

216
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:36,330
Um...

217
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,810
Ash, thank you for the super chat.

218
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,510
Thank you, thank you.

219
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:38,970
Hi, Doki.

220
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,710
I'm happy to tell you I finally got your Lunar New Year Crooks done!

221
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:42,670
It came...

222
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,890
It came out and it looks awesome...

223
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,030
Awesome next to my PC.

224
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:46,510
Thank you.

225
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,130
Thank you for the super chat.

226
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:47,390
Thank you.

227
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:47,770
Thank you.

228
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,450
I'm really happy.

229
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:52,110
I'm really happy things are slowly getting shipped out as always.

230
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:52,970
I'm always happy.

231
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,850
That's why we haven't had any new merch in a while.

232
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:55,830
In terms of like...

233
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,250
I'm distributing merch.

234
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,250
Like personal merch.

235
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,090
Um...

236
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,090
Because like I said...

237
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:00,650
Other people are like...

238
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,510
The reason why we haven't got any merch like the birthday stuff or like...

239
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:03,850
Uh...

240
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:04,770
Battle Bridge stuff.

241
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,190
Like it's all like in the pipeline.

242
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:13,030
But I'm not releasing anything until our merch situation of shipping stuff is fully like...

243
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,810
Fixed.

244
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:14,250
Like...

245
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:20,090
I just want that to be like fully fixed before I do like continuous releases.

246
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:21,570
And...

247
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,070
Um...

248
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:22,690
Also...

249
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,050
Um...

250
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:27,350
I want you guys to like save your money.

251
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,610
Because I don't want to milk you guys.

252
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,530
Like I don't...

253
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:33,750
Like...

254
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,690
Like I want...

255
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:39,930
I want to make sure you guys have enough money for like rent and like internet.

256
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,690
Because you need to have a place to live to watch me.

257
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:43,690
And...

258
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:45,910
And food.

259
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,830
Because you need food to survive.

260
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,170
So you could watch me.

261
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,330
So like...

262
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:50,730
You know...

263
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:53,830
I want to make sure you guys save enough money for...

264
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:54,870
You know...

265
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,470
Being alive.

266
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,770
So you could still watch me.

267
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,010
And subscribe to me.

268
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,170
And then have a family.

269
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,770
So you can have your kids.

270
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:09,630
Watch me.

271
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:10,890
And subscribe to me.

272
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,190
And have your wife or husband watch me and subscribe to me.

273
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,050
So like I need you guys alive.

274
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,850
So that's why like...

275
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,230
We are not having like...

276
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:19,850
Not like...

277
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,330
That's why I'm not like having like a lot of merch releases.

278
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:23,730
Um...

279
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,950
Just because like I want you guys to like...

280
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,370
To like be able to have...

281
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:29,010
You know...

282
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,010
Um...

283
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:30,650
You know...

284
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:30,930
Money.

285
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,590
I want you guys to have an income.

286
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,290
So you can be alive.

287
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,790
Anyway.

288
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,330
But yes.

289
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,090
I was very surprised.

290
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,470
And um...

291
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,730
That it went viral.

292
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:52,590
And like honestly like what the fuck were they doing?

293
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,830
Talking about all of this in a public voice chat.

294
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,350
There is discord on comment.

295
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,110
That is not an excuse.

296
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,030
Like...

297
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,190
Like I don't understand.

298
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:09,610
I don't understand how they had this entire conversation.

299
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,450
In a public voice chat.

300
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,870
This is a public Apex Legends lobby.

301
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,390
Like why are they talking about...

302
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,530
Like why were they flirting?

303
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:18,970
Okay.

304
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:22,170
Well to the guy it was obviously flirting.

305
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:26,210
But to the girl they were just really good friends.

306
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:27,870
Oh god.

307
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:28,330
Oh god.

308
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:28,890
Oh...

309
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,830
Poor guy.

310
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,190
Oh my god.

311
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,470
I am glad he did not hear that.

312
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,130
Like...

313
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:39,830
That's...

314
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:43,210
That's why I asked that question.

315
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,050
When he was like...

316
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,690
When he was DC'd.

317
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:51,690
Because like I felt like that was gonna fucking hurt him even more.

318
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:52,930
That was gonna...

319
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:56,370
That was gonna like actually destroy him.

320
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,510
Oh...

321
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:57,730
Oh...

322
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:58,310
Oh...

323
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,390
He knows now.

324
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,430
Maybe they don't.

325
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,410
Maybe they are not part of that side of the internet.

326
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,390
Who knows?

327
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,470
Oh my god.

328
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,130
But...

329
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,470
Oh my god.

330
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:10,970
You know...

331
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,110
I don't know if you guys heard it.

332
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,710
Because I was talking over it.

333
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:14,410
And like...

334
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,170
Because even I was shocked.

335
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,250
But like...

336
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,030
After she was like...

337
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:19,390
No.

338
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,010
She went...

339
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,050
God no.

340
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:25,470
So you didn't hear that other no.

341
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,210
You heard the first no.

342
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:28,310
So...

343
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,070
I was like...

344
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,350
But the second no.

345
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,470
Was...

346
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,710
God no.

347
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,040
So...

348
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,320
I was just like...

349
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,240
Oh my god.

350
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,120
That poor man.

351
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,160
Holy shit.

352
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,680
Oh...

353
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,880
Oh...

354
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,280
So thank god that guy DC'd.

355
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:00,880
Oh...

356
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,140
Oh...

357
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,140
Before he heard that.

358
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,100
And that he came back before he heard her...

359
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,320
Heard the disgust in her voice.

360
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,480
Like...

361
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,880
Oh my god.

362
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:12,840
And the...

363
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,240
The...

364
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,620
The twist of the knife there...

365
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,980
Was the fact that Peter was listening in to all of this.

366
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,800
Because he was right next to her.

367
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,880
So he could literally hear her talk to him.

368
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,520
Like...

369
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,460
That's so weird.

370
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,760
That's so weird.

371
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,060
I just...

372
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,760
What the...

373
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,360
She was like...

374
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,800
Peter is right next to me.

375
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,640
So like...

376
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,000
He's...

377
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,220
Peter is literally listening to like this entire conversation from her end.

378
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,720
So it's like...

379
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,160
I don't know...

380
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,940
That's just weird.

381
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,360
That's just so weird.

382
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:49,140
This entire situation was so fucking cringe and weird.

383
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,320
And then there's me.

384
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:59,720
The random person in the lobby that has to listen in to all of this.

385
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,240
Like...

386
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,400
Yeah.

387
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,920
I'm just a random person.

388
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,840
The random VTuber that's just...

389
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,480
There.

390
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,860
That has the...

391
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,540
The little insight into their lives.

392
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,460
That they put out publicly.

393
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,620
And I dragged you guys down with me.

394
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,980
So now we all know about their life.

395
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,320
Now we're all gonna like...

396
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,240
Five years later.

397
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,720
Down the road.

398
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,440
We're all gonna be thinking about...

399
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,380
Salt.

400
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,140
Sadness.

401
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,940
Happy死스리.

402
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,380
I wonder how they're doing right now.

403
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,560
Or like...

404
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,620
Are Sami and Peter still together?

405
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:38,620
Or like...

406
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,560
Is THIS Salt...

407
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:39,780
Like...

408
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,200
Shadow?

409
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:40,700
Like...

410
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,540
Is she still trying?

411
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,300
I thought I was the third wheel!

412
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,240
I was actually the fourth wheel!

413
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,340
That's actually...

414
00:20:53,340 --> 00:21:01,120
I think my favorite part of the conversation was that I was watching Mike.

415
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,580
Oh, you guys were like, I'm getting third hand embarrassment right now.

416
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:12,900
I am getting the second hand embarrassment and you guys were like, I'm getting the third hand embarrassment, man.

417
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:22,540
I didn't know we turned into a drama channel, but let's go, I suppose.

418
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,240
Delta, thank you for the super chat.

419
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,580
Thank you, thank you.

420
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,720
Oh my god, that's actually crazy.

421
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,500
I can't believe it.

422
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:38,580
Well, at least like, you know, despite my PC being an absolute fucking bitch, at least I got content.

423
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,020
At least I got my content.

424
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,140
Alright.

425
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,240
Alright, anyway.

426
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,940
God of War time.

427
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:54,880
Pew, pew, pew.

428
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,600
Oh wait, no.

429
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,380
They don't have guns.

430
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,500
Back then in the ancient times.

431
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,300
What is it?

432
00:21:59,300 --> 00:21:59,860
Slash, slash, slash.

433
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,740
Oh, it doesn't have the same ring to it.

434
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:08,420
Alright, let me make sure that we have everything a-okay.

435
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,380
Give me a sec.

436
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,840
Let me get boy into here.

437
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,440
Alright, boy.

438
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,320
That's the only thing I know about this game.

439
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,280
Oh, that's not true.

440
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,280
I also know about the...

441
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,680
The threesome.

442
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,920
In the first God of War game.

443
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,160
I know about that too.

444
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,460
I don't know why, but that was like...

445
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,040
That's like it.

446
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,580
Cause I was way too young.

447
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,020
I was way too- it's in the first God of War game or something.

448
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,560
But there's like a scene with like some fucking- I don't know.

449
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,320
Some goddesses.

450
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,600
Yeah, the- was it a quick time event?

451
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,840
I was definitely way too young.

452
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,780
I was way too young.

453
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,180
It was that like- and then it was like the God of War.

454
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,900
And the- yes, the quick time event minigame.

455
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,580
In the very first God of- or was it the first or third God of War?

456
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,980
Whichever it was.

457
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,860
All of them?

458
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,600
Okay, all of them.

459
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,340
Wait, it was all of them?

460
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,200
Okay.

461
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:35,340
So I remember there's apparently a quick time event where you bang one of the goddesses or something.

462
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,180
Or multiple goddesses.

463
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,320
And like, I was way too young to learn about that.

464
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,180
But like- but like, well not that young.

465
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,800
But like, definitely where I was like, who the fuck?

466
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,940
Cause it was on like- I just- I remember because it was like- it went viral.

467
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,380
It should not have went viral.

468
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,120
Um.

469
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,480
It was- it should not have went viral.

470
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,440
But like, people were like, oh my God.

471
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,020
Because it was like so out there.

472
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,200
What the fuck, a quick time event?

473
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,180
When were you- what the fuck?

474
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,300
The betting quick time event?

475
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,220
Oh.

476
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,240
Anyway.

477
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,300
Obviously they- he has a son now.

478
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,740
So apparently one of the quick time- apparently.

479
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,220
So obviously he has a son now.

480
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,640
So I guess he failed one of the quick time events.

481
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:26,500
Um.

482
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,400
So now- now he has to deal with being a father.

483
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,660
So yeah!

484
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,500
Wait, I wonder why I can't- Okay, let me see if I- I'm gonna reboot this.

485
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,920
So I can have controller.

486
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,820
I actually don't- it has to be like controller.

487
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,420
Cause it like came out for the console.

488
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,480
Alright.

489
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,060
Alright, here we go.

490
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,560
Yeah, the quick time- quick time event game.

491
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,320
Failed.

492
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,800
Alright, let's see.

493
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,220
Give me a console!

494
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,800
Give me my controller!

495
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,160
I don't wanna play this on MMK.

496
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,180
Alright.

497
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:09,900
Guys.

498
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,680
Guys, this is an issue.

499
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,800
Because my controller is not registering.

500
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,200
This is- that is not good.

501
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,240
That's not something.

502
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,800
To be happy about.

503
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,100
Well.

504
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,140
Oh.

505
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,620
Help us build.

506
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:33,800
Guys.

507
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,640
Why is my controller not registering?

508
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:36,980
Guys.

509
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,540
Guys.

510
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:40,800
Guys.

511
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,220
Maybe it's my- oh!

512
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,780
Maybe I disabled it!

513
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,300
You know what?

514
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,080
I could've.

515
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,460
Let me double check.

516
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,240
I need to make sure I did not disable the controller.

517
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,960
Alright, controller settings.

518
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:52,700
Next.

519
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,040
Next.

520
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:53,800
Next.

521
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,200
Okay.

522
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,540
It says I have my controller installed in there.

523
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:58,460
Alright.

524
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:02,560
Guys.

525
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,160
Guys.

526
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:09,070
Okay.

527
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,710
We're gonna- maybe we gotta- we gotta go to the settings!

528
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,470
Maybe like in the settings.

529
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:14,350
There you go.

530
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:15,290
Okay.

531
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,710
Maybe like in the settings.

532
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,090
Oh.

533
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:22,110
Why am I- why am I laggy?

534
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:25,710
What the fuck is going- I have 64 gigabytes of RAM.

535
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,470
Like.

536
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,280
What's going on?

537
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,920
What's- what's going on?

538
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:35,720
Okay.

539
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:36,720
Okay.

540
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,920
What's- what's going on?

541
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,620
What's going on?

542
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,000
Oh!

543
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,420
100% CPU!

544
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,660
100%!

545
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,100
Okay.

546
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,500
Let's- gameplay.

547
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,340
Okay, guys.

548
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,820
We are at 100% CPU.

549
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,020
That's not good.

550
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:05,320
I feel like that is not good at all.

551
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:12,140
So let's... um... let's figure this out.

552
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:23,480
Ow... I'm a little worried right now.

553
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,720
I'm a little worried.

554
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,660
Guys... give me controller.

555
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,400
Why can't I use controller?

556
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,620
I don't understand!

557
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,820
Turn on DLSS.

558
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,460
Okay, give me a sec.

559
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,580
Original... though...

560
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:43,040
But... it's original!

561
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,280
How?

562
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:49,960
You turn off the AMD off?

563
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:50,600
Oh!

564
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,400
Okay.

565
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,780
Performance quality... off.

566
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,540
There we go.

567
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,700
Sorry.

568
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:55,860
Is that better?

569
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,100
Is that...

570
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,320
Did we do it?

571
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,140
Did...

572
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,960
Did we do it?

573
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:05,800
Did...

574
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,260
Did we do it?

575
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,200
It's still at 100.

576
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,900
I don't feel very...

577
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,860
I don't feel very confident right now.

578
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,120
From 5 to 7.

579
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,260
Oh!

580
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:19,840
Oh!

581
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,140
It feels a little better.

582
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:22,700
It feels better.

583
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,620
It feels better.

584
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,300
Alright.

585
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,460
We're doing it.

586
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:25,700
Alright.

587
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:25,700
We're doing it.

588
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:25,880
We're...

589
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,820
We're slowly...

590
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,160
We're...

591
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,640
Okay.

592
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,700
FPS limit 120.

593
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,740
Zero motion blur.

594
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,600
That's good.

595
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,040
That's very good.

596
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,020
Um...

597
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,140
Um...

598
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,260
I think...

599
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,720
I think...

600
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,600
I don't like...

601
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:42,720
Oh!

602
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,000
It's at 90%!

603
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,380
I mean, 90% CPU sounds...

604
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,960
Sounds a lot better.

605
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,040
So...

606
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:52,940
So...

607
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,000
So...

608
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,700
So...

609
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:55,980
I don't like that.

610
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,520
The 90% makes me feel a lot nicer.

611
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,440
Oh my god.

612
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,220
Alright.

613
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,340
That's good.

614
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,100
Okay.

615
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:09,900
Alright.

616
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:10,580
Nice.

617
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,800
I'm a bit sad that I can't play this on the controller, right?

618
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,860
Is it because I have a PlayStation...

619
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,080
Okay.

620
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,940
I'm gonna get my PlayStation 5 controller.

621
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:19,600
Give me a sec.

622
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,840
Maybe it's because this game is for PlayStation.

623
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,240
I mean, Sony.

624
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:24,480
Sony?

625
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,460
Alright.

626
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,440
I'm dead.

627
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,060
Please!

628
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,600
I just wanna yell, boy!

629
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,280
Just like Sean!

630
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,080
Alright.

631
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,900
Let's see.

632
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,540
It says, press B.

633
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,580
But like...

634
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,460
It's not registering it.

635
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,600
Which is awkward.

636
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:54,820
Okay.

637
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,160
Yeah.

638
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,360
Okay.

639
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:55,680
It works.

640
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,980
It's because...

641
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,500
You have to play...

642
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,220
You have to...

643
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,360
Sony was like, no, no, no.

644
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,380
Get that Microsoft dog shit out of here.

645
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:05,580
Yeah.

646
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,260
They're like, no, no, no, no.

647
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,460
We know you're using Microsoft on our Sony game.

648
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,120
How fucking dare you?

649
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,040
Alright.

650
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,000
I'm gonna make sure everything is...

651
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,320
Okay.

652
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:23,920
Original.

653
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:24,820
Yes.

654
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,020
Photo mode.

655
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,360
View controllers.

656
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,560
Gameplay.

657
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,320
Tutorial mode.

658
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,060
Default.

659
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:31,500
Okay.

660
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,500
I don't like controller vibrations that much.

661
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:34,980
So...

662
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,080
We'll do that.

663
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:36,740
Quick turn.

664
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:37,920
HUD.

665
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,220
Camera.

666
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,360
We'll do...

667
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,680
Minimal camera shake.

668
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,700
It's like...

669
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:45,620
Aim assist!

670
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,480
Fuck yeah!

671
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,260
Aim assist!

672
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,040
Okay.

673
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,440
Audio.

674
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:49,920
Alright.

675
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,600
As always...

676
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,580
We'll turn down the music just a little bit.

677
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,260
Because...

678
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,820
We need the dialogue.

679
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,440
And then we'll also do that too.

680
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,640
And then...

681
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:01,520
On.

682
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,660
There we go.

683
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,840
We're good.

684
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,840
Are we good to go?

685
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,320
Oh!

686
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,960
I can't even hear the audio!

687
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,600
Oh my god!

688
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:10,980
It's like...

689
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:11,780
On my...

690
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,520
Fucking...

691
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,040
Give me a sec.

692
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:13,860
My...

693
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,120
The audio went to my...

694
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:16,960
My controller.

695
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,160
The audio went to my controller!

696
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,160
Give me a sec.

697
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:22,740
I'm like...

698
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,240
What the fuck?

699
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,000
I can't hear!

700
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,860
It literally went to my controller!

701
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,240
Alright.

702
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:29,860
There we go.

703
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,240
That should be good.

704
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,100
Is it on system?

705
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,480
Yeah.

706
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,920
Do I hear anything?

707
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:37,920
Wait.

708
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,800
Why don't I hear anything?

709
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,320
It should be on my system!

710
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,440
Oh my god.

711
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,100
Oh, there we go.

712
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,900
I have to close it.

713
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:45,460
Alright.

714
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:45,860
We're good.

715
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:47,840
Alright.

716
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,400
New game.

717
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,480
Give me a balance.

718
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,820
Give me a challenge.

719
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,740
We want some more.

720
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,320
You know what?

721
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:54,740
Wait.

722
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:54,900
No.

723
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,860
God of War is...

724
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:56,700
Wait.

725
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:00,910
Wait.

726
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:01,790
But it's not...

727
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:02,730
You don't shoot your gun.

728
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:03,870
Um...

729
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,030
We don't...

730
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:05,570
We don't...

731
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:05,930
We don't...

732
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,070
You don't shoot your...

733
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:10,630
There's no guns in God of War.

734
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,690
Challenge is actually pretty hard.

735
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,170
That's...

736
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:18,970
That's enough.

737
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,350
We're not doing...

738
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,370
I've never played God of War before!

739
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:32,130
There's no gun in God of War!

740
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:35,270
If there were guns in God of War...

741
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,630
I would easily pick God of War.

742
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,190
But he...

743
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:40,950
Can you tell?

744
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:42,070
He doesn't carry a gun!

745
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,850
He's thinking about the time he lost the QuickTime event.

746
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:46,490
And now he's fucking...

747
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:47,330
Um...

748
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,170
Now he has to take care of a child.

749
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,840
It's not Gun of War.

750
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,420
It's...

751
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,780
He has an axe!

752
00:32:59,220 --> 00:32:59,680
Alright.

753
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:00,820
Boom.

754
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:03,740
Alright.

755
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,000
Get down here.

756
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:06,900
You know what's...

757
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,180
It sucks.

758
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,520
Because my windows deactivated itself.

759
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,880
I have activate windows on the far...

760
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,660
Like bottom right.

761
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:15,860
Boom.

762
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,100
Oh, game is a bit low?

763
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:18,720
Don't worry.

764
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,360
I'll turn it up.

765
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:19,980
Sorry.

766
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,220
Just stay there for a little bit, sir.

767
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,240
Just...

768
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,060
Fuck trees!

769
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,560
That's right, Mr. Beast.

770
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,700
You're getting canceled.

771
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,740
So now I'm gonna cut down all the trees I planted.

772
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,620
I'm taking it all back.

773
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,000
Whoa.

774
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,460
Is he okay?

775
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,660
We're undoing...

776
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,740
We're undoing the trees.

777
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,540
I found some.

778
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,360
Oh my god.

779
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:16,980
No, the child.

780
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,820
Get in the boat, boy.

781
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,600
Haha!

782
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,260
He said the thing!

783
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,880
He really did get more depressed after having a kid.

784
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,580
Holy shit.

785
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,000
He's carrying all of that himself?

786
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,600
Start the boy counting.

787
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,120
Alright.

788
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,200
Audio is a bit still.

789
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:54,700
A bit low.

790
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,300
Okay.

791
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,760
Oh shit.

792
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,500
What the fuck?

793
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:58,820
Where...

794
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,680
Oh, it's Midgard!

795
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,780
That's not what I want to do.

796
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,820
Where am I?

797
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,280
Where's the settings?

798
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,420
Why did this...

799
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:06,820
Okay.

800
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:07,760
Okay.

801
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:08,940
Settings.

802
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:09,660
Audio.

803
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,400
Okay.

804
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,100
I'll turn up the music a little...

805
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:13,780
More.

806
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:14,740
Alright.

807
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:16,980
Alright, boy!

808
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,080
Let's go to your mother?

809
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,320
Or my single father?

810
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,540
Oh!

811
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,760
That means I'm not a deadbeat!

812
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,360
I'm not a deadbeat father.

813
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:31,760
No!

814
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,520
That boy is going to grow up with mommy issues.

815
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:43,670
Single father and ready to mingle?

816
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,710
Oh my god, he's a doof!

817
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,110
Recently single father.

818
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,890
Alright boy, your mother left you because she didn't want you anymore.

819
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,530
So I gotta take care of you.

820
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:11,070
You know, you can have multiple mommies if you want.

821
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:16,150
God of War 1-3 did a lot for me.

822
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,640
Wait, how is it different?

823
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,500
It's Midgard.

824
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,560
It's less godly, that's for sure.

825
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:33,910
Okay guys, I really do not like the vibrations.

826
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:39,590
Like, every time I row the fucking boat, it vibrates.

827
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,610
Like, get that out of here.

828
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,410
Get that out of here.

829
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,210
Like, I do not need the controller.

830
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:50,210
To vibrate every fucking time I row the boat.

831
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,310
Like, what is it trying to do?

832
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,930
How is this immersion?

833
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:58,810
The boat doesn't vibrate!

834
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,390
Okay, bring up overall sound.

835
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:06,950
Okay.

836
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,260
Ooh, hello tree.

837
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,060
Daniel Busetti.

838
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,320
Oh, you guys don't see that.

839
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:27,600
I like how it took me, like, fucking eight chops to chop the tree down.

840
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,840
But I can literally carry this entire tree.

841
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,720
Like, how fucking...

842
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,220
I don't know, what is this, like, strength?

843
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,240
Can I walk?

844
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:41,840
Can I run?

845
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,340
No.

846
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,100
Yes, this is my first game of the franchise.

847
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,400
I've never played God of War before.

848
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,160
Uh...

849
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,720
Thank you for the super chat, Funels.

850
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,440
Thank you, thank you.

851
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,140
So I have no knowledge of anything.

852
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:54,920
Strength, yes.

853
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,300
Alright.

854
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,680
Eight chops is pretty...

855
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,260
Eight chops?

856
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,640
But he can just carry this entire tree!

857
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,980
If he can carry the entire tree, he can chop a tree down after three.

858
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:18,160
Okay, we might need to do some more stuff to lower the CPU, if you guys have any ideas.

859
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:25,370
Whoa.

860
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,300
Is that my log cabin?

861
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,260
Do we live here?

862
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:38,600
Oh

863
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,400
my god, Burrito!

864
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,120
Thank you for the Akka soup!

865
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,180
Oh my god, is that, like, my wife?

866
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,060
Is he...

867
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,440
Is that... Is that his mom?

868
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,040
The fuck is...

869
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,140
The fuck is she?

870
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,820
Well, there do I see my mother.

871
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,900
Well, there do I see my father.

872
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,060
Oh!

873
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,640
Oh my god, he's gonna grow up with so many issues.

874
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,420
Well, there do they call to me.

875
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,300
How did she die?

876
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,720
Well, there do they call to me.

877
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,200
Well, there do they call to me.

878
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,900
Oh my god.

879
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,980
Well, there do they call to me.

880
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,720
He's gonna have so many issues.

881
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,260
She's ready.

882
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,840
Their voices is quiet?

883
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,680
Okay, I'll turn it up even more later.

884
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:21,480
Look, this is a very emotional scene and I don't wanna like, go to the settings page while we're carrying our dead wife.

885
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,760
She failed her own quick time events.

886
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:00,030
Oh, they're gonna burn her!

887
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:16,040
Well, I have like, no emotional attachments here because I don't even know what she looks like, so...

888
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,380
I have like, no background of her.

889
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,180
Chris, she just exists to be dead.

890
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,420
What the fuck are you doing?

891
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,320
Fire is hot?

892
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,760
Did your mom didn't teach you that?

893
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,160
This is why she's dead.

894
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,620
I'm sorry.

895
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,240
This knife...

896
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,120
It was hers.

897
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,580
Now it is yours.

898
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:06,750
She taught you to hunt.

899
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:09,270
She knew.

900
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,010
Shall we?

901
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:11,890
Now?

902
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:12,750
Stab him!

903
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:13,770
Stab your father!

904
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:18,810
Wait, is he actually gonna stab me?

905
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:25,930
What you got there?

906
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:26,630
A knife!

907
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:27,310
No!

908
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,800
It's not a knife.

909
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:36,860
What are we hunting?

910
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,140
You are hunting...

911
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,190
Which way?

912
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:45,170
In the direction of deer.

913
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:46,510
What the fuck does that mean?

914
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:47,610
Okay...

915
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:51,630
Artie's like...

916
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:52,810
Okay...

917
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:56,850
What the fuck is in the direction of deer?

918
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,590
Like, deer is everywhere?

919
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:02,450
Even Artie's like, what the fuck do you mean?

920
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:04,470
Stop talking in riddles!

921
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:05,850
Okay, let me...

922
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:07,210
Boost up the volume.

923
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:09,130
A bit more, too.

924
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:10,170
All right.

925
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:12,010
All right, guys.

926
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,450
We're gonna play a little game.

927
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:15,170
How do I reduce CPU?

928
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:23,250
Let's play a little game, everybody.

929
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:25,610
How do I reduce the CPU?

930
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:30,710
This is what happens when I swap to AMD from Intel.

931
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:33,750
Okay.

932
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:35,790
V-Sync is off.

933
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:36,550
Wait.

934
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:38,010
Turn off DLSS.

935
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:38,990
All right.

936
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:41,130
We're gonna turn off DLSS.

937
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:42,570
And then...

938
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:44,450
There's low shadows?

939
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:46,910
The fuck do you mean low shadows?

940
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:49,650
Yeah.

941
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:52,430
We're in AMD territories now.

942
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:57,530
Because Intel is dying at the moment.

943
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:00,130
Framerate down.

944
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:00,690
Okay.

945
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:02,030
I am willing to...

946
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,890
I am willing to...

947
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:05,190
Okay.

948
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:05,270
Okay.

949
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:08,070
I'm willing to negotiate and we'll make it 100.

950
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:10,490
I'm willing to negotiate, guys.

951
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:12,170
This is dead space all over again.

952
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:13,830
But, like, you don't understand.

953
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:17,590
I cannot live...

954
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:19,970
I cannot live under 100 frames.

955
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,090
I will actually die.

956
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:28,850
My body will wither away if you make me go below 100.

957
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:30,990
All right.

958
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:31,550
Custom.

959
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:32,530
All right.

960
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:34,030
We don't need shadows.

961
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:37,530
Like, what the fuck do we need shadows for?

962
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:38,350
What...

963
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:39,810
Do we need a reflection?

964
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:41,010
What if I don't...

965
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:41,430
Actually, no.

966
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:42,530
The reflections look nice.

967
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:45,950
The reflections actually look nice.

968
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:48,470
Okay.

969
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:51,130
Let's see.

970
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:52,570
Look.

971
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:53,570
My eyes...

972
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:54,250
If I go...

973
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:57,810
If my eyes go below 100 frames, I will go blind.

974
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:00,330
Like, my eyes are too...

975
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:04,010
My eyes...

976
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:08,830
My eyes have been spoiled for way too long to go beyond...

977
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:10,050
To go below 100.

978
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,450
I will actually go blind.

979
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:15,790
And if I cannot see, then what's the point anymore?

980
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:21,710
All right.

981
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:24,470
All right.

982
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:25,230
Here we go.

983
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:26,330
Let's see.

984
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:28,190
100 frames.

985
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:29,550
This is my limit.

986
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:30,450
All right.

987
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:31,490
There we go.

988
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:33,390
Uh...

989
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:34,430
We should...

990
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:36,630
I don't know if we're gonna be okay, but, like...

991
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:37,970
There we go.

992
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:41,430
All right.

993
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:42,330
Here we go, boy.

994
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,100
All right.

995
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,440
What did you find, boy?

996
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,200
What are these?

997
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,060
What tracks are these?

998
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:59,520
I don't need to access camera settings.

999
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:02,560
That a boy.

1000
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,340
Where are we going?

1001
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:03,940
Boy.

1002
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:04,480
Oh, boy.

1003
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:04,780
Oh, boy.

1004
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:04,880
Oh, boy.

1005
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:04,960
Oh, boy.

1006
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:05,080
Oh, boy.

1007
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,860
Oh, hey, what's this?

1008
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:14,240
Lost and found?

1009
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,340
A new artifact?

1010
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:17,580
What's this?

1011
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,460
We found this little toy near the house.

1012
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,120
I used to have one like it.

1013
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,620
I think it may be part of a set.

1014
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:25,320
If we find more, they may be worth something.

1015
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:25,920
XP!

1016
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,960
I like XP.

1017
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,620
Oh, a chest!

1018
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,660
Oh, I got a hack silver.

1019
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:35,940
Whatever that is.

1020
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:41,520
Oh, okay, we don't have to blast it.

1021
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:46,500
Okay, I'll turn down the sound effects.

1022
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:49,840
Let me know what you think, sound guy, because I did adjust it a lot.

1023
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:51,900
After.

1024
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,160
All right, I'll put it at 72.

1025
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,300
That's how real men open.

1026
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:00,520
What, you don't smash it?

1027
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,680
Using keys are for pussies.

1028
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:05,620
People are like, we gotta find a key.

1029
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,440
Why find a key?

1030
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:07,380
A chest is made of wood.

1031
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:08,380
Just smash the chest.

1032
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:12,680
Throw a chest at a really high building, and then smash it.

1033
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:15,060
I mean, I don't know if the items are...

1034
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:21,440
I don't know if the items are gonna be smashed, but like, at least the box is gone.

1035
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:29,710
Oh, nice.

1036
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:31,950
And destroy.

1037
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:33,430
That's what the chest is for.

1038
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:35,490
It's gonna absorb the impact, guys.

1039
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:40,550
The chest will absorb the impact, and the loot will be fine.

1040
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:41,390
Trust me.

1041
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:42,570
And destroy.

1042
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:42,570
That's what the chest is for.

1043
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:42,570
It's gonna absorb the impact, guys.

1044
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:42,770
Deer!

1045
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:45,390
Why is his antlers blue?

1046
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:46,750
Slow down, boy.

1047
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:48,090
Sorry.

1048
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:51,250
You are hunting deer, not chasing it.

1049
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:52,330
Oh, God, it's time to smash.

1050
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:56,230
Boy, smash.

1051
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:04,610
I just love how he just punches it in the center.

1052
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:06,290
Oh, look, there's treasure!

1053
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:08,310
Treasure!

1054
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:09,550
Can I go down?

1055
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:10,590
No, not yet.

1056
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:11,030
No, not yet.

1057
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:11,090
No, not yet.

1058
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:11,550
I'm gonna hack silver.

1059
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:14,050
I guess hack silver is like the money.

1060
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:16,090
He broke our bridge.

1061
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:18,350
How the fuck did he break that?

1062
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:19,210
Step aside.

1063
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:21,810
Am I gonna smash it?

1064
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:22,670
Oh, my axe.

1065
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:26,250
And then...

1066
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:28,390
Oh, does it come back?

1067
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:30,890
Where'd my axe go?

1068
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:31,570
Oh.

1069
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:32,990
What happened here?

1070
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:33,450
Oh, okay.

1071
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:35,810
Oh, I can recall it!

1072
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:36,950
Like in...

1073
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:37,990
Oh, that's cool.

1074
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:40,930
I was like, what was gone forever?

1075
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:41,110
I was like, what was gone forever?

1076
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:43,350
Kill him?

1077
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,080
Damn!

1078
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,840
Bro, his mom just literally just died today.

1079
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:03,220
Damn!

1080
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:08,660
I'll bet there's no therapy in Midgard Kateyama!

1081
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:11,440
This child's not gonna get any have.

1082
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:15,020
This child's gonna grow up as a serial killer, I bet you.

1083
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,440
This child's gonna grow up as a serial killer, I bet you.

1084
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,280
Oh my gosh.

1085
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:27,080
This is what happens when you fail the QuickTime event.

1086
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,840
If you didn't fail it...

1087
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,720
You wouldn't have to deal with that.

1088
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,460
Be better.

1089
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:42,780
Oh, okay.

1090
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,740
This guy is fucking weak.

1091
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:46,520
Boom!

1092
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,440
Oh shit!

1093
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:48,720
Oh, okay.

1094
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:49,180
That's fine.

1095
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:53,560
Wait, this is easy.

1096
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,260
Hey, you have a bow!

1097
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:58,600
Shoot!

1098
00:49:58,760 --> 00:49:59,880
Oh no, I took the bow.

1099
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:00,180
Sorry.

1100
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:01,900
Maybe I shouldn't have took the bow.

1101
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:06,280
Now this is gun of war!

1102
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:10,760
Hey, I'm supposed to block?

1103
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:13,240
Why block when I can do this?

1104
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:18,820
Woo!

1105
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:21,760
I will never learn anything else!

1106
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,300
There we go.

1107
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,080
I

1108
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:30,300
block!

1109
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:31,900
Just back away slowly!

1110
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:35,300
Nice.

1111
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:39,080
I like how they're like, remember to block and evade!

1112
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,260
Will it keep going until I learn?

1113
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:41,760
No.

1114
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:42,560
Okay, that's good.

1115
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,000
That's good.

1116
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,320
That's very good.

1117
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,260
How do I block?

1118
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:47,580
Oh.

1119
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:52,800
Nice.

1120
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,240
Alright.

1121
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:54,260
Guys, it's okay.

1122
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,840
It's okay.

1123
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:59,200
I will use block at another stage of my life.

1124
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,480
Told you.

1125
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:05,680
Axe of war.

1126
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:09,540
I did it, guys!

1127
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,420
I learned!

1128
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,200
X to evade?

1129
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:13,320
How the fu- Oh, like this?

1130
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,280
Oh, this is evade.

1131
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,500
Guys, I'll learn- I'm gonna learn it.

1132
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:17,560
Oh, this is evade.

1133
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:17,560
Guys, I'll learn- I'm gonna learn it.

1134
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:18,640
After.

1135
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:26,380
Who needs to learn your lesson when I can just cheese it?

1136
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,160
It's so nice.

1137
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:34,360
I knew they would always be gun when I wanted it.

1138
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:36,220
Meow.

1139
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:39,040
Alright, any loot?

1140
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:40,320
I love loot.

1141
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:43,920
Might be a father now, but...

1142
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:47,560
Boy, I'm gonna teach you the axe of grave robbing.

1143
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:50,340
Oh.

1144
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,120
Smash it!

1145
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:54,180
Oh, I can smash this!

1146
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,240
Find and solve three seals?

1147
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,300
I gotta use my brain?

1148
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,820
But what if I smash?

1149
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,200
Oh, nice.

1150
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,020
Okay.

1151
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:03,260
That is the answer.

1152
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,160
Thank god.

1153
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:11,260
That's good to know that the answer is always smash.

1154
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:13,580
Oh, there's the last one.

1155
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:15,200
There you go.

1156
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:16,740
Alright.

1157
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:20,680
It's just smashing, but like, with different- with a different chest.

1158
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:24,580
Money?

1159
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:26,140
Yay!

1160
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,380
You collected one of three Ion's apples.

1161
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,000
Needed to increase your maximum health.

1162
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,140
Oh, nice.

1163
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:33,140
Alright.

1164
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:35,660
Ion's apples are your choice of food of the gods.

1165
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,380
Find the nine total apples in the world.

1166
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,140
In a chest locked by magic.

1167
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,160
Every three you collect.

1168
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:42,260
Oh, I like HP.

1169
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:43,440
Oh my god!

1170
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,940
There's all the three free money!

1171
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:50,080
But I guess we don't- I mean, we live in a fucking cabin, so I guess we don't need money.

1172
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,900
Like, we're- we're- we're like, literally hermits.

1173
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,200
We're isolated from the world.

1174
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,200
Like, what are we gonna buy?

1175
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:00,680
I don't think there's any shop nearby.

1176
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,180
Mom's literally dead.

1177
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:05,380
And it's your fault, child.

1178
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:07,460
Remember that.

1179
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,400
Wait, I don't know where to go.

1180
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,360
Oh, that's where the deer is.

1181
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,680
Okay, then I should go this way.

1182
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:15,820
But

1183
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,240
we please- Damn.

1184
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:27,440
Forget what your mom told you.

1185
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,060
It's loot time.

1186
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,220
That's right, boy.

1187
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:34,780
Follow the man.

1188
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:38,860
You think you can- you have free will?

1189
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,120
You think you can tell me what to do?

1190
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,580
I am like 300,000 years old, I think.

1191
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:46,180
I don't know.

1192
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:48,940
Is that it?

1193
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,600
Oh, what if I- Cut that.

1194
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,220
Wait, there's like- you can go up.

1195
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,500
How do I go up?

1196
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,600
Boy, how to go up, boy.

1197
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:02,720
Oh.

1198
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:04,960
Up I go.

1199
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:06,840
Up I go.

1200
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:09,760
Alright.

1201
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:11,700
Let's see.

1202
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:13,220
And then down I go.

1203
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:14,680
What is this?

1204
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:16,960
Climb the chain.

1205
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:19,680
Down I go.

1206
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:20,200
Weeeee.

1207
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:23,860
Okay.

1208
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,300
That's right.

1209
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,100
Boy!

1210
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:28,720
Fucking help!

1211
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:29,760
Use your knife!

1212
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:35,000
What is the point of having your mom's shake knife if you don't shake?

1213
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:38,820
Like, you're just gonna watch me do all the work?

1214
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,560
You're never gonna grow up in this world.

1215
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:42,760
They weren't mean.

1216
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:43,860
They were starving.

1217
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:48,570
And now we'll not starve!

1218
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:51,650
That's the best part, boy!

1219
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:58,010
I've always admired wolves, but the ones we've encountered attacked us on sight, which means they're probably rapid.

1220
00:54:58,290 --> 00:54:59,730
I guess to them we are food.

1221
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,010
I know it's, um...

1222
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:05,670
I know it's kill or be killed, but still, they're beautiful in their own way.

1223
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:07,510
And killing them makes me a little sad.

1224
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:09,230
Good thing father won't read this.

1225
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:13,450
Oh, my boy's a fucking pussy.

1226
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:19,330
Don't worry, boy.

1227
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:21,650
You're gonna kill them all.

1228
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:24,870
Especially if they're starving.

1229
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:30,610
You think you have privacy now, boy?

1230
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:33,330
Your mom is not here anymore.

1231
00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:38,030
And I will make sure you will not even have doors in your room.

1232
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:43,210
As your father, I will come in anyway.

1233
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:45,530
Because I am your father.

1234
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:47,950
And what I say is law.

1235
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:52,070
And now you're gonna grow up in 20 years to resent me.

1236
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:54,370
And then never speak to me ever again.

1237
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:58,790
But for now, I will have 20 years to do this!

1238
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:06,430
Alright, let's open this grave.

1239
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:08,490
Desecrate the grave!

1240
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:12,250
Desecrate the grave!

1241
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:15,970
Alright, let's see...

1242
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:18,770
I guess I looted everything.

1243
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:23,910
Have the wolves ever thought about climbing out of here?

1244
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:25,410
There's literally nothing here.

1245
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:28,950
Alright, let's see...

1246
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:30,650
I think that's it.

1247
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:31,930
Alright, we're gonna turn...

1248
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:35,910
We're gonna turn down the sound effects...

1249
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:38,590
by 10.

1250
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:41,290
And then...

1251
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:44,110
Boost up the overall audio a little bit more.

1252
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:47,010
Alright, let me know if this is a lot better.

1253
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:47,810
Audio guy.

1254
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:49,690
Alright.

1255
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:53,810
Toki, are you okay?

1256
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:56,770
Gary, thank you for the super chat.

1257
00:56:56,970 --> 00:56:57,490
Thank you, thank you.

1258
00:56:57,650 --> 00:56:57,990
Yeah.

1259
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:03,270
Guys, I'm a VTuber.

1260
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:04,630
We're not all...

1261
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:05,950
We're not okay.

1262
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:11,790
If you're a VTuber...

1263
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:13,830
You're already not okay.

1264
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:17,810
This way, right?

1265
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:20,350
Yeah, now we can go here.

1266
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:24,450
I'm respecting your privacy by knocking.

1267
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:26,010
But it's already my fault.

1268
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:26,390
Don't worry.

1269
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:31,230
Alright.

1270
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:33,690
Let's see.

1271
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:36,910
Guys, I don't know if you guys know this...

1272
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:39,650
But even I know Kratos is not a very...

1273
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:41,190
Very good guy.

1274
00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:44,210
Before he became a father.

1275
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:47,450
Becoming a father...

1276
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:50,110
Does not change who you are.

1277
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:51,150
Like...

1278
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:54,950
You just have a smaller version of yourself.

1279
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:56,450
But like...

1280
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:59,750
Becoming a father doesn't hide the shit you did...

1281
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:02,490
In the first three games in the trilogy.

1282
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:03,690
Like...

1283
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,360
Alright.

1284
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:12,860
Yay!

1285
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:18,940
Oh, he was a father before?

1286
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,980
Then he was always like this.

1287
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:22,720
Can I have my bow back now?

1288
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,480
He had a daughter?

1289
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:31,480
What the fuck happened to her?

1290
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:33,640
What...

1291
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,160
What happened to her?

1292
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:38,060
I didn't even know about the daughter.

1293
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:41,860
Oh shit.

1294
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,080
He's not...

1295
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:43,380
He's...

1296
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:44,180
He's not real.

1297
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:45,940
He's just an illusion.

1298
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,880
Look, you always have to test these things, guys.

1299
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:49,340
You...

1300
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:52,120
You always have to test it out.

1301
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:54,380
I had to make sure he was real.

1302
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:56,360
He's not.

1303
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:57,840
He's not real.

1304
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:02,480
I'm fucking going through some shit over my dead wife.

1305
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:05,560
So I'm imagining about a son that we could have had.

1306
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:08,000
I'm not a murderer if he never died.

1307
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:09,720
That's the thing.

1308
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:10,320
I know.

1309
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:12,000
It was her wish.

1310
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:13,380
And...

1311
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:14,580
It was time.

1312
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:15,700
Okay.

1313
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,060
All right.

1314
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:25,850
All right.

1315
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:30,730
Enemy during combat is to play above them when they take damage or when targeted by Kratos.

1316
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:32,070
All right.

1317
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:46,160
You mean I never have to block again?

1318
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:49,000
God, I love this game.

1319
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:53,360
Yay!

1320
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,820
Are you going to run at me?

1321
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:58,800
That's right.

1322
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:00,820
You can't even get close to me.

1323
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:02,220
That's right.

1324
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,080
There he goes.

1325
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:03,860
Easy.

1326
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,740
Easiest game of my life.

1327
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:06,860
Oh, wait.

1328
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:07,220
There's more.

1329
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:07,880
Oh, fuck.

1330
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:08,380
It's all right.

1331
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:09,760
It's all right.

1332
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,260
Easiest game of my life.

1333
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,420
This is so...

1334
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:17,140
I'm setting the watch.

1335
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:18,580
What do you mean?

1336
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:24,840
Why give me this mechanic if I'm not going to abuse it?

1337
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:27,640
Like, what do you expect?

1338
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:28,380
Wait.

1339
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,300
Can I go back?

1340
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:31,440
I didn't realize that was the other...

1341
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,340
You can headshot with that?

1342
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,460
Oh, this changes everything.

1343
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,980
Guys, this knowledge changes everything.

1344
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:42,640
Okay.

1345
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:45,240
Let's...

1346
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:45,400
Let's...

1347
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:45,660
Just pull.

1348
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:47,100
Pull.

1349
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:47,780
Pull.

1350
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,140
What do I do here?

1351
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,360
What do I hit?

1352
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:55,520
This?

1353
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:57,920
What am I supposed to hit?

1354
01:00:59,300 --> 01:00:59,820
This?

1355
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,020
Oh!

1356
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:03,100
The glowy thing!

1357
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:03,760
Sorry.

1358
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:04,520
It wasn't yellow.

1359
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:05,620
So, I couldn't tell.

1360
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:09,300
I've been trained on yellow!

1361
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:12,260
How was I supposed to know blue was it?

1362
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:13,280
Like...

1363
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:13,660
Okay.

1364
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:14,060
Okay.

1365
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:15,380
Okay.

1366
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:16,000
Alright.

1367
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:17,360
Let's open this.

1368
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:18,960
Time to desecrate your grave.

1369
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:23,140
They should have burned your body so it wouldn't get looted by me.

1370
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:24,620
Wait.

1371
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:25,480
I don't understand.

1372
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,060
Do we go this way or this way?

1373
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,400
Should I just leave my son?

1374
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:29,520
Alright, son.

1375
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:30,120
We're going to...

1376
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,160
I'm going to go this way.

1377
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:32,820
No, no, no.

1378
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:33,200
You...

1379
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:35,480
That's right.

1380
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:36,720
You go there, little boy.

1381
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:37,980
You go there.

1382
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:40,020
I'm trying to figure out where they go.

1383
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,120
Where am I?

1384
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:42,560
Is that me?

1385
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:44,960
And then this is...

1386
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:45,380
Oh!

1387
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,020
Okay.

1388
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:47,080
Guys.

1389
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,840
Is right side the detour?

1390
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:50,500
Is right side loot?

1391
01:01:55,870 --> 01:01:56,410
What?

1392
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:04,490
Why is there a little hole that's just you size?

1393
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:06,230
Okay.

1394
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:08,290
We're going to go this way for loot.

1395
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:11,950
That's just your size.

1396
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:13,690
Alright.

1397
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:16,110
It just needs some yellow paint.

1398
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:17,290
You're right, Nova.

1399
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:17,910
Oh!

1400
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:19,490
Jesus!

1401
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:20,190
You have your...

1402
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:20,630
Oh, wait.

1403
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:20,830
I...

1404
01:02:20,830 --> 01:02:22,230
Oh, he can't hit shots yet.

1405
01:02:22,590 --> 01:02:23,070
Alright.

1406
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:23,650
Don't worry.

1407
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:27,250
I'm just going to make sure I hit you in the head.

1408
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:30,290
Oh, shit!

1409
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:30,970
No!

1410
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:33,050
Bad dog!

1411
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:36,410
Oh, shit.

1412
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:36,710
Wait.

1413
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:37,290
What the fuck?

1414
01:02:38,410 --> 01:02:39,270
Oh, shit.

1415
01:02:39,310 --> 01:02:40,430
Now there's two of you?

1416
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:41,890
Alright.

1417
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:42,810
There you go.

1418
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:43,250
We're fine.

1419
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:46,050
I'm trying to hurt your child.

1420
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:47,470
I'm not hurting my child.

1421
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:48,670
He's not right.

1422
01:02:48,670 --> 01:02:48,870
He's not real.

1423
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:50,610
My axe goes through him.

1424
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:56,470
So, he's just a figment of my imagination because I'm living through the guilt of my dead wife.

1425
01:02:58,130 --> 01:03:00,550
You are not ready for trolls, boy.

1426
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:01,030
Alright.

1427
01:03:01,390 --> 01:03:01,670
I know.

1428
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:03,010
I just...

1429
01:03:03,010 --> 01:03:04,030
What's this?

1430
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:07,790
I've always admired...

1431
01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:07,870
Oh.

1432
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:10,450
Boys typically hunt in packs and will try to surround their prey.

1433
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:14,230
Father would try to keep them in front of him and let me help draw their attention.

1434
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:14,850
Damn!

1435
01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:17,090
What's this?

1436
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:18,650
Oh.

1437
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:19,810
Are you drawing?

1438
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:21,190
What the fuck is that?

1439
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:24,230
No boy of mine is going to fucking draw.

1440
01:03:28,490 --> 01:03:30,210
We are hunters, boy.

1441
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:36,330
Alright.

1442
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:36,910
Oh, hey.

1443
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:37,590
A dead man.

1444
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:39,210
Alright.

1445
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:39,590
Nice.

1446
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:40,370
Okay.

1447
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:42,450
Let's ask more Lu.

1448
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:47,810
He just didn't end up.

1449
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:48,170
Oh.

1450
01:03:48,210 --> 01:03:48,630
Oh.

1451
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:51,170
My boy is not going to be a hunter.

1452
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:53,150
He is...

1453
01:03:53,150 --> 01:03:53,510
Oh, wait.

1454
01:03:53,550 --> 01:03:53,670
No.

1455
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:55,290
My boy is not going to be an artist.

1456
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:56,970
He is a hunter.

1457
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:58,350
Alright.

1458
01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:01,590
Let's head off.

1459
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:05,360
Alright.

1460
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:06,060
Let's go.

1461
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:09,200
Let's pull this thing.

1462
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:12,120
Alright.

1463
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,440
Come on, boy.

1464
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:18,240
Go into the little gate that's apparently U-sized.

1465
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:19,640
Very convenient.

1466
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:20,100
Oh.

1467
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:21,140
What's that?

1468
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:22,080
There you go.

1469
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:24,200
And then we're going to go here.

1470
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:26,860
Alright.

1471
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:28,040
Let's go.

1472
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:29,920
Nice.

1473
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:31,360
We did it.

1474
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,360
We're so smart.

1475
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:32,920
Man.

1476
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:35,560
This is why I'm the god of war.

1477
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:37,460
I think he's this way.

1478
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:38,380
Yeah.

1479
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:38,880
But there's Lu.

1480
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:40,400
Look.

1481
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:40,920
We need Lu.

1482
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:42,740
So I can be the strongest.

1483
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:46,800
Alright.

1484
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:47,860
Let's see.

1485
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:49,240
Up we go.

1486
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:50,100
Let's go.

1487
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:53,440
Oh my god.

1488
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:56,820
I don't like it when he, like, fucking straddles me like that.

1489
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,780
Where did he come from?

1490
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:01,140
Where the fuck did he come from, too?

1491
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:01,720
Wait.

1492
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:02,920
I want to see how he...

1493
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:04,660
Okay.

1494
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,080
I don't know.

1495
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:07,700
It's like a little fucking goblin.

1496
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:08,460
You know?

1497
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,160
Like those...

1498
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:13,480
It's like those, like, Dragon Ball Z green guys.

1499
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:16,100
That's why I'm uncomfortable.

1500
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:18,240
It reminds...

1501
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:18,440
Okay.

1502
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:19,380
So that does fire.

1503
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:22,560
It reminds me of those, like, Dragon Ball Z goblin guys.

1504
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:23,800
That, like...

1505
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:27,260
That fucking explodes when you hug them like that.

1506
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:27,900
Wait.

1507
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:28,960
Can I cut the rock?

1508
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:30,640
I can't cut the rock?

1509
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:31,460
Wait.

1510
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:32,320
But can I cut this?

1511
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:34,740
No.

1512
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:35,800
Okay.

1513
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:37,500
Yeah.

1514
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:38,540
The Cyberman.

1515
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:42,240
He's your little goblin.

1516
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:43,800
It reminds me of that.

1517
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:45,920
That makes me uncomfortable.

1518
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:47,720
It feels like he's gonna fucking explode.

1519
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:49,360
Okay.

1520
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:50,560
Is there anything here?

1521
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:53,160
No.

1522
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:54,580
What's over here?

1523
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:56,680
Is this loot?

1524
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:58,440
Loot.

1525
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:00,660
What is this?

1526
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:02,660
Boy.

1527
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:03,600
I can't read.

1528
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:06,860
Wait.

1529
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:07,720
I actually can't read.

1530
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:09,660
My guy is just like me.

1531
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:10,140
For real.

1532
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:10,500
For real.

1533
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,780
What's happening there at the end?

1534
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:14,820
They eat the sun and moon?

1535
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:16,640
And then everybody fights?

1536
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:19,060
Oh.

1537
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:19,360
Okay.

1538
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:20,700
So.

1539
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:24,300
Find all the shrines.

1540
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:28,520
There's a giant lift behind the shrines that tell stories from their history.

1541
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:29,300
I love these stories.

1542
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:29,940
My mom told them.

1543
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:31,020
Let's see how many we can find.

1544
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:32,260
I fucking knew it.

1545
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:32,860
I can't read.

1546
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:34,500
That's why I keep him around.

1547
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:38,740
His mother taught him how to read so I don't have to read.

1548
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:39,680
So.

1549
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:42,960
Wolf giants.

1550
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:46,300
Skull chases the sun and hate the moon.

1551
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,000
What happens when they catch their prey?

1552
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:49,340
Looks like a massive fish.

1553
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:50,220
Could it be?

1554
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:51,540
I fucking knew it.

1555
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:52,640
That's why I kept him.

1556
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:54,480
So I can have the reader.

1557
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:57,060
So he can read all the lore for me.

1558
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:04,810
What is he doing?

1559
01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:06,090
Invading Nordic lands.

1560
01:07:07,850 --> 01:07:09,010
Oh, there it is.

1561
01:07:09,770 --> 01:07:10,530
Oh, okay.

1562
01:07:11,930 --> 01:07:13,670
Why is it blue and not yellow?

1563
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:16,290
I can't read in blue.

1564
01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:19,150
Alright, nice.

1565
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:22,150
Then, open.

1566
01:07:28,070 --> 01:07:28,550
Alright.

1567
01:07:29,030 --> 01:07:29,910
Let's see.

1568
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:31,250
Get some money.

1569
01:07:31,930 --> 01:07:33,070
And some loot.

1570
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:35,670
Sound guy, does it sound better now?

1571
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:40,250
Boy, translate this, boy.

1572
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:42,910
Wait, have I been here?

1573
01:07:43,970 --> 01:07:45,130
Where did I come from?

1574
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:46,690
Where did I go?

1575
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:47,710
Cotton Eye Joe.

1576
01:07:48,290 --> 01:07:50,510
Oh no, this is where he gripped me.

1577
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:51,650
And I was like, ooh.

1578
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:55,110
Alright.

1579
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:56,670
Oh, shit.

1580
01:07:56,830 --> 01:07:57,090
Whoops.

1581
01:07:57,650 --> 01:07:58,810
Well, we gotta do this again.

1582
01:07:59,130 --> 01:08:01,170
I went the wrong way.

1583
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:02,830
Alright.

1584
01:08:04,730 --> 01:08:07,670
Alright, here we go.

1585
01:08:11,330 --> 01:08:11,770
Nice.

1586
01:08:11,930 --> 01:08:12,650
We did it.

1587
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:14,370
Oh, I can...

1588
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:15,250
Alright, give me a sec.

1589
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:15,750
Alright.

1590
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:17,650
One last adjustment, guys.

1591
01:08:17,770 --> 01:08:18,870
And then it'll be perfect.

1592
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:22,850
But also, I need to, like, bring up my...

1593
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:24,090
I need to bring up, like...

1594
01:08:24,190 --> 01:08:25,090
The Super Chats.

1595
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:26,330
Because I couldn't see them earlier.

1596
01:08:26,610 --> 01:08:27,250
I'm sorry.

1597
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:28,630
No, but thank you again for the...

1598
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:29,550
I don't even remember if I read this.

1599
01:08:29,650 --> 01:08:30,750
But no, but thank you again for the Super Chat.

1600
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:31,070
Thank you.

1601
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:31,490
Thank you.

1602
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:32,910
Needs some yellow paint.

1603
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:33,430
It does.

1604
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:34,850
Why is it blue?

1605
01:08:36,270 --> 01:08:36,630
For...

1606
01:08:37,070 --> 01:08:37,250
For...

1607
01:08:37,930 --> 01:08:38,650
50 years!

1608
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:39,490
It's been yellow!

1609
01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:41,550
And they decided to make it blue?

1610
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:52,480
Wait, did he, like, illegally cross the border to get to Nordic lands?

1611
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:53,660
He's simply a target.

1612
01:08:53,780 --> 01:08:55,220
Clear your mind.

1613
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:56,400
What if I shoot him in the butt?

1614
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,280
Steady your aim and...

1615
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:02,580
Feet solid.

1616
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:04,360
Steady yourself.

1617
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,060
Exhale and release.

1618
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:08,360
That's not the point!

1619
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:14,950
I can't believe it!

1620
01:09:15,310 --> 01:09:16,350
The gill...

1621
01:09:18,650 --> 01:09:19,990
There's no choice.

1622
01:09:20,110 --> 01:09:21,670
This is the illusion of choice.

1623
01:09:22,090 --> 01:09:24,130
I can't believe it!

1624
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:26,650
This is the illusion of choice.

1625
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:27,310
It's...

1626
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:37,210
I was robbed.

1627
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:38,990
I was robbed.

1628
01:09:39,230 --> 01:09:44,830
This was a cutscene that's already been made.

1629
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:51,790
Kill him.

1630
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:53,290
Do it.

1631
01:09:53,470 --> 01:09:53,670
Huh?

1632
01:09:53,850 --> 01:09:55,170
Do it.

1633
01:09:55,170 --> 01:09:55,390
Do it.

1634
01:09:56,850 --> 01:09:57,970
Stab him in the head.

1635
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:00,390
Do it.

1636
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:02,090
Your mother would be so proud.

1637
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:09,960
Don't look at him.

1638
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:10,500
Stop looking!

1639
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:12,340
The longer you look, the more you'll feel!

1640
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:22,060
Bro, why is he doing it so... Bro, why do it so slow?

1641
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:24,100
That's fucked!

1642
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,700
That's fucked, man.

1643
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:34,900
He could've been like...

1644
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:44,020
He's like, alright, you're gonna watch the light drain from his eyes as we slowly plunge it in.

1645
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:50,200
That's the only way to go.

1646
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:53,220
That's the only way to go.

1647
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:53,480
That's the only way to go.

1648
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:54,640
You did it, boy.

1649
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,120
You killed your first deer.

1650
01:10:58,060 --> 01:10:58,660
Congratulations!

1651
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:01,680
Wow!

1652
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:04,980
Oh my god!

1653
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:07,300
Where did he come from?

1654
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:09,220
That's my deer!

1655
01:11:17,180 --> 01:11:18,380
Oh shit!

1656
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:20,160
Oh shit!

1657
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:21,600
Where's his weak spot?

1658
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,320
Press 12 to command or shoot arrows.

1659
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:25,880
Hold 2 to target.

1660
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:27,960
Hold 2 and square and press to target.

1661
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,600
Enemies will be distracted from attacking.

1662
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:30,300
Oh, that's cool.

1663
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,880
Number of arrows can shoot is indicated in the lower right.

1664
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:34,560
One shot, arrows take time to recharge.

1665
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,000
Alright, is he shooting his arrows?

1666
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:42,140
Do it now!

1667
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:43,820
Do it now!

1668
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:44,960
Do it now!

1669
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:47,440
Do it now!

1670
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:48,580
Get... It's fine!

1671
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:50,340
That's fine!

1672
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,420
That's fine!

1673
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:53,060
Do it now!

1674
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,340
Am I doing any damage?

1675
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,300
I don't know!

1676
01:11:58,700 --> 01:11:59,060
Wow!

1677
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:00,140
Do it now!

1678
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:02,520
Do it now!

1679
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:03,620
Shoot him!

1680
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:09,300
Oh my god.

1681
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:09,760
I know!

1682
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:11,680
I'm trying to aim for it!

1683
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,080
I am trying!

1684
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:14,680
I'm not a controller player!

1685
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:18,560
I am... Please!

1686
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:23,140
I am absolutely trying to shoot it over there!

1687
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:26,160
I don't know if you can tell, but I am!

1688
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:29,440
Please!

1689
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:32,600
I am absolutely trying my best!

1690
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:38,520
Oh my god!

1691
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:42,040
Oh shit!

1692
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:42,960
Wow!

1693
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:43,680
Shoot him!

1694
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:45,220
Shoot him!

1695
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:47,900
I am commanding him!

1696
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:58,240
Oh my god!

1697
01:12:58,760 --> 01:12:59,560
Please!

1698
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:01,060
Please!

1699
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:04,820
I'm not good at aiming on the fucking controller!

1700
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:08,700
I... I reflexively go for head!

1701
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:11,400
It's like a curse!

1702
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:12,940
It's a curse!

1703
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:16,040
Why is your weak point on your arm?!

1704
01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:18,940
Is that where your brain is located?!

1705
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:24,880
Why?!

1706
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:26,960
Oh god.

1707
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:28,320
Oh god.

1708
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:29,620
Oh god.

1709
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:31,440
Okay.

1710
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:32,620
Alright.

1711
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:33,800
Okay.

1712
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:35,460
Okay, this is fine.

1713
01:13:35,860 --> 01:13:36,780
This is fine.

1714
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:40,340
Slow and steady wins the race!

1715
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:42,020
Slow and steady...

1716
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:44,080
wins the race!

1717
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,080
I am fighting!

1718
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:52,940
I will fight...

1719
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:54,920
with just my...

1720
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:56,280
axe of war!

1721
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:58,840
And that's how you do it.

1722
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:01,160
That's how you do it.

1723
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:02,400
Get in here!

1724
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:03,760
That's right!

1725
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,660
Go bash your brains out!

1726
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:09,740
No!

1727
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:11,220
Aim...

1728
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:12,680
This is aim.

1729
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:15,940
That's fucking right.

1730
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:19,640
What the fuck?!

1731
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:20,320
Damn!

1732
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:27,120
The god of cheese wins again!

1733
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:30,260
They give us super chat cats!

1734
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:30,820
They can take...

1735
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:30,920
Oh!

1736
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:33,660
Oh, he has issues already!

1737
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:43,090
We did it?!

1738
01:14:43,090 --> 01:14:44,730
Boy, what did you do?

1739
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:45,010
weren't.

1740
01:14:45,090 --> 01:14:45,610
Are

1741
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:51,040
you serious?

1742
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:53,820
I found the deer.

1743
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:56,200
I found the deer.

1744
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:56,800
I proved myself!

1745
01:14:57,620 --> 01:14:58,140
Ready!

1746
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:01,940
We are going home...

1747
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:07,220
Boy, you didn't even shoot at the yellow!

1748
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:08,160
I have insisted for a long time!

1749
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:10,960
to be fair, I'm not very great teacher!

1750
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:12,540
I have insisted for a long time!

1751
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:12,700
I've been holding on...

1752
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:13,360
Good, I appreciate that!

1753
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,180
I am NOT ready!

1754
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:16,000
JOGO JP on mute!

1755
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,900
Sorry, my controller failed.

1756
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:25,540
SHA ان!

1757
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:25,660
Haha!

1758
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:27,400
So am I ready!

1759
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:27,480
Grab the Diablos!

1760
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:32,220
I had to blow my nose and I dropped my controller.

1761
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:33,920
Alright.

1762
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:34,660
Sorry.

1763
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:35,940
Sorry, boy.

1764
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:39,380
Alright, you're not ready.

1765
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:40,980
Damn!

1766
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,860
You've lost your speaking privileges, boy.

1767
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:48,240
Jeez.

1768
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:50,760
Holy shit.

1769
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:52,580
Imagine telling your child that.

1770
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:54,640
You're not allowed to speak again.

1771
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:57,260
Alright.

1772
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:03,480
Mother always used to tell me stories about him to try and scare me if I wandered off too far.

1773
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:08,300
I think she'd be proud of me, but father thinks because I got a little angry that I'm not ready.

1774
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:09,060
Whatever.

1775
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:10,680
I just helped him kill a troll.

1776
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:11,860
I know I'm ready.

1777
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:13,860
Mother told me a lot of stories about trolls.

1778
01:16:14,220 --> 01:16:17,120
The one's name translates to death merchant.

1779
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:20,720
With a name like that, I think it's safe to assume he was pretty evil.

1780
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:21,960
Damn.

1781
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:25,220
That my boys got anger issues.

1782
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:27,300
That's when I know he's definitely mine.

1783
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:34,700
Now I know this boy is mine.

1784
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:38,140
Just like your old man.

1785
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:41,340
Alright.

1786
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:41,920
Here we go.

1787
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:43,980
Let's see.

1788
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,400
Blitz, thank you for the super chat.

1789
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:48,820
Thank you.

1790
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:49,500
Thank you.

1791
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:51,900
Who's he trying to shoot at?

1792
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:52,620
Kill him.

1793
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:53,500
Okay.

1794
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:55,840
An enemy's stun bar is located below their health bar.

1795
01:16:56,240 --> 01:17:00,420
Attacking an enemy in quick succession inflicts stun damage, causing the bar to fill.

1796
01:17:00,660 --> 01:17:01,740
You can grab it.

1797
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:05,020
Arrows and barehanded attack inflicts extra stun.

1798
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:08,420
You can switch to by throwing an axe or sheathing the axe.

1799
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:09,720
Sheathing the axe?

1800
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,780
Why would I need to ever sheathe the axe?

1801
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:12,860
Alright.

1802
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:15,740
Where the fuck did my axe go?

1803
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,480
Was it still in his fucking body?

1804
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:18,580
Like...

1805
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:19,580
What?

1806
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:23,000
I didn't even realize it was still in his body.

1807
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:24,240
Whoa!

1808
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:25,420
They can dodge?

1809
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:26,860
I dodged this.

1810
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:28,880
Okay.

1811
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,180
Can my boy die?

1812
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:32,520
Alright.

1813
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:32,980
Nice.

1814
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:35,060
Nice.

1815
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:36,240
Headshot.

1816
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:37,500
Easy.

1817
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:39,360
Boy, what the fuck?

1818
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:40,780
That's a bush.

1819
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:42,500
That's a rock!

1820
01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:43,560
You shot a rock!

1821
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:45,260
See, this is why you're not ready.

1822
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:46,720
You literally shot a rock.

1823
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:49,740
Dodge this.

1824
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:51,080
Alright.

1825
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:51,940
Let's see.

1826
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:56,480
Are there any loot in the boxes or are they just here to troll you?

1827
01:17:57,540 --> 01:17:58,100
Oops.

1828
01:17:58,300 --> 01:17:59,760
I meant to do that?

1829
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:00,740
Wait, what?

1830
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:02,860
What?

1831
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:04,540
Am I supposed to...

1832
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:06,180
Hold journal.

1833
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:10,660
Find and enter all chambers when able.

1834
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:12,740
There are six, seven locked doors.

1835
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:14,140
How do I unlock it?

1836
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:16,200
Open sesame.

1837
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,900
Still can't get the doors open, huh?

1838
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:19,420
Oh.

1839
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:20,220
Quiet.

1840
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:24,180
I have to touch it for later?

1841
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:25,400
I have to come back here?

1842
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:27,700
Quiet.

1843
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:28,400
Damn.

1844
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:30,100
Oh.

1845
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:31,680
Is there... Oh, there is loot!

1846
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:33,200
Wait!

1847
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:36,320
I could've got extra loot this entire time?

1848
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:38,060
Oh.

1849
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:39,720
Oh shit.

1850
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:40,260
Okay.

1851
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:42,260
I missed out on a lot of loot.

1852
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:43,860
I didn't know!

1853
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:44,080
Oh!

1854
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:46,180
Oh my god!

1855
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,900
I missed out on all the loot!

1856
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,500
I can't believe it!

1857
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:55,660
Oh, that was health?

1858
01:18:55,820 --> 01:18:56,000
Okay.

1859
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:56,920
That doesn't matter then.

1860
01:18:57,880 --> 01:18:58,380
Alright.

1861
01:18:58,420 --> 01:18:58,820
Shoot him.

1862
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:00,300
Now I'm gonna do this.

1863
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:06,380
That's alright.

1864
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:08,320
Nice.

1865
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:09,960
Boy, shoot him too!

1866
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:10,460
Boy!

1867
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:11,760
Shoot him!

1868
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:14,920
Let your anger out!

1869
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:16,380
Build it all up inside!

1870
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:18,880
Wait, what?

1871
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:19,480
Whoa!

1872
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,240
You made me dodge.

1873
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:23,280
I don't like that.

1874
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:28,560
I didn't play this game to fucking dodge.

1875
01:19:28,740 --> 01:19:29,800
What is it?

1876
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:31,280
He's gonna... What?

1877
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,740
He's gonna... What?

1878
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:34,360
He... What?

1879
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:39,880
Okay.

1880
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:44,540
What?

1881
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:44,620
What?

1882
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:45,840
Oh.

1883
01:19:47,540 --> 01:19:48,440
That's right.

1884
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:50,580
I will use my fist.

1885
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:52,600
Oh, you think...

1886
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,620
You think I don't have legs?

1887
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:56,900
That's right!

1888
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:58,920
I will kick you!

1889
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:00,240
That...

1890
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:02,020
No way!

1891
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:06,140
You think the axe is all I can do?

1892
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:07,240
No!

1893
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:10,320
That's fucking right!

1894
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,640
Get outta here!

1895
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:15,140
I use an axe cause I'm lazy!

1896
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:20,180
How dare you make me put an effort!

1897
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:23,620
Take him to the wall!

1898
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:28,520
Let's see.

1899
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:30,700
Wolf giants, skull... Oh, wait.

1900
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:30,880
What?

1901
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:32,600
That's not what I wanted to look at.

1902
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:34,900
Alright.

1903
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:35,660
Let's see.

1904
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:37,780
Is there anything here that I missed out on?

1905
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:41,820
We finally got a proper...

1906
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:43,860
What is that supposed to mean?

1907
01:20:45,820 --> 01:20:49,980
All that I'm saying is the axe is 100% faster.

1908
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:54,600
It's cause I'm moving, okay?

1909
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:55,820
It's a lot harder when you're moving.

1910
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:59,560
I just need to know two moves.

1911
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:03,160
Alright.

1912
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:05,460
The marked tree returned to the house.

1913
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:07,160
But why would a fire troll

1914
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:12,790
think that attack was a good idea?

1915
01:21:12,790 --> 01:21:12,830
I don't know.

1916
01:21:12,830 --> 01:21:14,910
Boy, I said quiet.

1917
01:21:15,790 --> 01:21:16,230
Boy.

1918
01:21:17,870 --> 01:21:19,250
I said quiet.

1919
01:21:19,450 --> 01:21:21,690
Do you not know what quiet means?

1920
01:21:24,510 --> 01:21:24,950
Alright.

1921
01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:26,310
Back home we go!

1922
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:27,710
Yeah!

1923
01:21:29,830 --> 01:21:30,810
Is this not home?

1924
01:21:32,150 --> 01:21:34,270
Yeah, this is home cause this is where we burned our wife.

1925
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:35,990
Look!

1926
01:21:36,170 --> 01:21:37,790
Some of the parts aren't fully burned yet.

1927
01:21:37,990 --> 01:21:38,730
So let me chop it.

1928
01:21:38,830 --> 01:21:40,210
I knew I should have chopped it up.

1929
01:21:41,490 --> 01:21:42,790
Are those trees or that?

1930
01:21:42,830 --> 01:21:44,390
Those are the parts of my dead wife.

1931
01:21:45,890 --> 01:21:46,890
I can't tell.

1932
01:21:47,050 --> 01:21:48,550
I can't tell if that's bark or not.

1933
01:21:49,870 --> 01:21:50,390
Okay.

1934
01:21:51,690 --> 01:21:52,610
Let's go inside.

1935
01:21:55,050 --> 01:21:55,890
Go inside.

1936
01:21:56,070 --> 01:21:56,890
It's time to sleep.

1937
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:03,900
I'm not disrespecting her, see?

1938
01:22:04,060 --> 01:22:05,460
I'm paying tribute right now!

1939
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:08,420
After I just dis... before I disrespected her.

1940
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:21,940
Damn, I'm depressed.

1941
01:22:22,940 --> 01:22:24,540
Now I have two dead wives.

1942
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:49,660
Oh.

1943
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:53,960
I clearly like this one more than the other one.

1944
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:57,220
Cause I don't think I have a momentum of her.

1945
01:23:05,490 --> 01:23:06,790
I mean I'm getting better.

1946
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:11,070
I only have one... I didn't have two dead children this time.

1947
01:23:14,420 --> 01:23:15,900
So I'm improving.

1948
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:17,840
My record's getting better.

1949
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:20,900
Third time's a charm like they say.

1950
01:23:27,620 --> 01:23:29,200
She's on my skin?

1951
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:31,480
Am I worrying my dead first wife?

1952
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:33,880
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1953
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:39,120
Holy shit!

1954
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:41,880
What the fuck is wrong with him?

1955
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:43,440
You lost control.

1956
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:45,840
That thing was trying to kill us.

1957
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:47,760
It's not like you don't get anger in a fight.

1958
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:49,160
Anger can be a weapon.

1959
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:51,200
If you control it.

1960
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:51,980
Use it.

1961
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:53,580
You clearly cannot.

1962
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:56,500
I haven't been sick in a long time.

1963
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,220
I'm better now.

1964
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:00,940
Fine.

1965
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:06,270
Come on then.

1966
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:08,890
He want me to hit you.

1967
01:24:08,970 --> 01:24:09,830
I want you to try.

1968
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:17,320
Let's smack him.

1969
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:19,860
Damn!

1970
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:21,160
Too slow.

1971
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:22,120
Damn!

1972
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,380
Cut it out!

1973
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:24,940
Weak.

1974
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:25,380
Again.

1975
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:27,120
Again!

1976
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:27,960
Stop it!

1977
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:28,260
Again!

1978
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:30,460
That's right.

1979
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:31,760
You're weak.

1980
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:35,660
How dare you not have the reflexes of a god.

1981
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:37,360
You

1982
01:24:40,650 --> 01:24:41,930
can get lost in it.

1983
01:24:42,570 --> 01:24:43,970
The battle ahead is difficult.

1984
01:24:46,090 --> 01:24:48,970
And you, Atreus, are clearly not ready.

1985
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:51,730
Damn.

1986
01:24:52,230 --> 01:24:52,690
What was that?

1987
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:53,350
Quiet.

1988
01:24:53,570 --> 01:24:54,170
That's fucked.

1989
01:24:55,810 --> 01:24:56,930
Dad of the year.

1990
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:04,400
Who's that?

1991
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:07,080
There's no use hiding anymore.

1992
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:09,720
I know who you are.

1993
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:10,460
Who doxxed him?

1994
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:10,840
What's going on?

1995
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:12,280
Do you know him?

1996
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:13,840
More importantly.

1997
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:15,660
Suddenly I know what you are.

1998
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:16,460
Boy.

1999
01:25:16,740 --> 01:25:17,620
Beneath the floor.

2000
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:18,260
Now.

2001
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:19,920
But you told me never to go down there.

2002
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:21,260
Who is that?

2003
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:22,100
I do not know.

2004
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:23,360
What's he talking about?

2005
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:24,320
I do not know.

2006
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:25,240
Get in.

2007
01:25:29,780 --> 01:25:32,260
Just tell me what I want to know.

2008
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:34,720
No need for this to get bloody.

2009
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:37,520
I heard there's a Greek god here.

2010
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:39,860
In Nordic town.

2011
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:43,100
Was he?

2012
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:48,840
I thought you'd be bigger.

2013
01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:52,220
You're definitely the one.

2014
01:25:54,220 --> 01:25:56,380
Long way from home, aren't you?

2015
01:25:57,300 --> 01:25:58,420
What do you want?

2016
01:25:59,740 --> 01:26:01,860
Oh, you already know.

2017
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:02,240
Oh my god.

2018
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:03,480
He is trying to kick me out.

2019
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:05,620
He knows I got here illegally.

2020
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:06,600
You don't have it.

2021
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,920
You should move on.

2022
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:14,460
And here I thought you're kind.

2023
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:15,940
You're supposed to be so annoying.

2024
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:17,480
Conner McGregor.

2025
01:26:17,580 --> 01:26:18,660
Better than this.

2026
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:20,200
So much smarter.

2027
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:21,160
Oh my god.

2028
01:26:21,220 --> 01:26:23,280
He's angry at a Greek god.

2029
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:24,780
As in Nordic country.

2030
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:27,260
Like a coward.

2031
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:32,280
The Norse border control.

2032
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:32,940
That's fucked.

2033
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:38,260
You're far from Greek, boy.

2034
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:40,100
Whoa.

2035
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:45,080
Leave.

2036
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:50,070
Home.

2037
01:26:50,810 --> 01:26:52,550
This ain't your home, boy.

2038
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:56,630
You're going to have to kill me for that to happen.

2039
01:26:58,330 --> 01:26:58,890
Oh.

2040
01:27:06,910 --> 01:27:07,470
Finally.

2041
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:14,020
You would not listen.

2042
01:27:14,740 --> 01:27:18,590
No, no, no.

2043
01:27:18,590 --> 01:27:19,890
Where the fuck are you?

2044
01:27:19,990 --> 01:27:20,950
Which Greek god are you?

2045
01:27:21,290 --> 01:27:22,570
Or not Norse god are you?

2046
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:28,820
My turn.

2047
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:29,680
Oh.

2048
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:32,560
Where did he go?

2049
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:34,540
Where's the mussel?

2050
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:42,060
Oh, where's your gun, though?

2051
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:50,060
Yeah.

2052
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:51,960
Yeah.

2053
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:52,460
That's right.

2054
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:55,300
Oh, shit.

2055
01:27:57,020 --> 01:27:57,620
Wait.

2056
01:27:58,180 --> 01:27:59,320
Oh, that's right.

2057
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:00,400
I knew it.

2058
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:01,980
I knew it.

2059
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:04,100
I knew I could still do this.

2060
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:04,200
No.

2061
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:06,560
That's right!

2062
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:08,480
Get close to me!

2063
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:12,340
That's fucking right!

2064
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:15,580
What you gonna do?

2065
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:17,640
What you gonna do?

2066
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:20,040
Walk slowly towards me?

2067
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,040
That's right!

2068
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:25,880
You can't get close to me to do anything!

2069
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:28,920
Get further away!

2070
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:29,920
Oh, no.

2071
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:30,820
Oh, no.

2072
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:31,180
No!

2073
01:28:31,460 --> 01:28:31,740
No!

2074
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:37,060
Wait, that's not supposed to...

2075
01:28:37,060 --> 01:28:37,860
Whoa!

2076
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,720
Oh, get... Fuck, bro!

2077
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:41,580
That's right!

2078
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:44,480
Get... Oh, shit!

2079
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:44,880
Okay.

2080
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:45,840
Okay.

2081
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:49,580
He's... He's very quick, guys.

2082
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:52,120
Okay.

2083
01:28:53,220 --> 01:28:54,060
You know what?

2084
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:55,000
I'm tired of this.

2085
01:28:55,340 --> 01:28:56,440
How dare you.

2086
01:28:56,860 --> 01:28:57,740
Whoa, fuck!

2087
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:00,580
Is he Quick Time Inventing me?

2088
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:03,140
Oh, no.

2089
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:04,160
It's part of the cutscene.

2090
01:29:04,420 --> 01:29:06,500
There's no way this isn't part of the cutscene.

2091
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:10,560
Get this dude.

2092
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:13,140
Why did he have to put...

2093
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:13,920
Oh, does he know?

2094
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:17,100
Does he know?

2095
01:29:21,670 --> 01:29:22,190
R1.

2096
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:22,710
R1.

2097
01:29:23,450 --> 01:29:23,970
R1.

2098
01:29:23,970 --> 01:29:24,490
R1.

2099
01:29:24,690 --> 01:29:25,210
R1.

2100
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:25,810
R1.

2101
01:29:25,830 --> 01:29:26,330
R1.

2102
01:29:26,490 --> 01:29:26,870
R1.

2103
01:29:27,170 --> 01:29:27,430
R1.

2104
01:29:27,730 --> 01:29:28,110
R1.

2105
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:28,150
What?

2106
01:29:28,490 --> 01:29:29,130
R1?

2107
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:31,310
Counter this, bitch!

2108
01:29:32,390 --> 01:29:33,790
That's fucking right!

2109
01:29:46,250 --> 01:29:47,010
That's right.

2110
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:48,390
R1!

2111
01:29:49,410 --> 01:29:50,790
That's fucking right!

2112
01:29:50,870 --> 01:29:52,230
I know how to R1!

2113
01:29:54,170 --> 01:29:55,570
Get out of here!

2114
01:29:56,050 --> 01:29:58,610
Get out of here!

2115
01:30:00,010 --> 01:30:02,050
Slow and old.

2116
01:30:02,170 --> 01:30:04,770
You should never have come to Midgard.

2117
01:30:06,070 --> 01:30:07,810
Wait, what the fuck?

2118
01:30:07,830 --> 01:30:09,090
He can regenerate?

2119
01:30:09,950 --> 01:30:11,250
Can't you try again?

2120
01:30:11,630 --> 01:30:12,530
That's not fair!

2121
01:30:12,990 --> 01:30:14,210
You talk too much.

2122
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:19,240
Oh, shit.

2123
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,160
He's so fast.

2124
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:23,800
He maxed out on Agility.

2125
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:24,260
He maxed out on Agility.

2126
01:30:24,260 --> 01:30:24,840
And Strength?

2127
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:25,100
And Strength?

2128
01:30:25,660 --> 01:30:30,520
Maybe whoever it is you've got stashed in that house will.

2129
01:30:32,020 --> 01:30:32,780
L.

2130
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:33,160
R.

2131
01:30:33,580 --> 01:30:34,760
Spartan Rage?

2132
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:38,000
Use the anger!

2133
01:30:38,540 --> 01:30:40,320
Use the anger, Kratos!

2134
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:42,240
R1 him!

2135
01:30:46,590 --> 01:30:47,830
Jesus Christ.

2136
01:30:47,990 --> 01:30:48,430
Who is this?

2137
01:30:48,710 --> 01:30:50,110
Who are you afraid of?

2138
01:30:50,110 --> 01:30:50,550
Fine!

2139
01:30:51,450 --> 01:30:52,210
Jeez!

2140
01:30:53,370 --> 01:30:54,890
Holy fuck!

2141
01:30:56,950 --> 01:30:58,710
Now that I have the...

2142
01:30:58,710 --> 01:31:00,470
What the fuck?

2143
01:31:01,170 --> 01:31:02,430
Oh, shit!

2144
01:31:02,550 --> 01:31:03,050
Okay.

2145
01:31:05,010 --> 01:31:06,150
Okay, yep.

2146
01:31:06,190 --> 01:31:06,810
I'm angry.

2147
01:31:07,090 --> 01:31:10,030
Oh, I am so fucking angry.

2148
01:31:10,330 --> 01:31:10,750
Oh, I am so fucking angry.

2149
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:11,390
Where are you?

2150
01:31:11,430 --> 01:31:12,170
Where are you?

2151
01:31:12,310 --> 01:31:13,930
I'm fucking mad!

2152
01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:16,410
I'm so mad!

2153
01:31:17,410 --> 01:31:18,370
Anger issues!

2154
01:31:19,330 --> 01:31:22,030
I don't need anger therapy!

2155
01:31:22,530 --> 01:31:22,650
I don't need anger therapy!

2156
01:31:22,650 --> 01:31:28,450
If I let my problems out onto other guys, I'm gonna let them go!

2157
01:31:28,450 --> 01:31:30,050
Oh, shit!

2158
01:31:30,210 --> 01:31:31,050
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2159
01:31:31,150 --> 01:31:32,170
That's not what I wanted.

2160
01:31:33,550 --> 01:31:34,330
There you go.

2161
01:31:36,970 --> 01:31:37,470
Alright.

2162
01:31:39,070 --> 01:31:39,850
Oh, shit!

2163
01:31:39,930 --> 01:31:40,170
No!

2164
01:31:41,090 --> 01:31:42,790
I wanted to cheese you!

2165
01:31:43,090 --> 01:31:44,230
How dare you!

2166
01:31:47,430 --> 01:31:49,050
How fucking dare you!

2167
01:31:49,230 --> 01:31:49,890
I will...

2168
01:31:50,450 --> 01:31:51,850
Yeah, that's fucking right.

2169
01:31:52,730 --> 01:31:53,390
That's right.

2170
01:31:55,010 --> 01:31:56,370
That's fucking right.

2171
01:31:56,510 --> 01:31:57,230
That's fucking right.

2172
01:31:57,230 --> 01:31:59,930
I will cheese you if it's the last thing I do.

2173
01:32:01,150 --> 01:32:02,730
That's fucking right.

2174
01:32:03,350 --> 01:32:04,070
Get...

2175
01:32:04,070 --> 01:32:04,890
Get cheese!

2176
01:32:13,510 --> 01:32:14,990
That's fucking right.

2177
01:32:15,970 --> 01:32:17,670
Where's your strength now?

2178
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:27,160
I am the god of cheese.

2179
01:32:28,220 --> 01:32:30,360
I shall crush you with a rock now.

2180
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:32,880
The fuck?

2181
01:32:33,020 --> 01:32:34,940
How did I get the rock in the back?

2182
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:35,700
Nice.

2183
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:38,620
I made a pancake.

2184
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:42,340
I made a little pancake.

2185
01:32:43,700 --> 01:32:45,460
And now I go home.

2186
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:47,180
I did my job, boy.

2187
01:32:48,460 --> 01:32:48,980
Alright.

2188
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:51,140
What a good day.

2189
01:32:51,860 --> 01:32:53,180
But how do I go home?

2190
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:55,520
Where do I go?

2191
01:33:01,090 --> 01:33:01,610
Where do I go?

2192
01:33:01,970 --> 01:33:03,090
Wait, where do I go?

2193
01:33:04,370 --> 01:33:07,270
How can I be lost already?

2194
01:33:07,770 --> 01:33:09,530
This is a very small area.

2195
01:33:11,390 --> 01:33:12,370
Oh, there it is.

2196
01:33:12,390 --> 01:33:13,350
There's the tiny pathway.

2197
01:33:14,350 --> 01:33:14,870
Yeah!

2198
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:15,430
Whoa!

2199
01:33:17,650 --> 01:33:20,070
Wait, he's alive?

2200
01:33:21,350 --> 01:33:22,390
Wait, he's alive?

2201
01:33:22,390 --> 01:33:23,050
Jesus Christ.

2202
01:33:23,150 --> 01:33:24,250
What the fuck?

2203
01:33:26,490 --> 01:33:28,190
Did you regenerate again?

2204
01:33:28,530 --> 01:33:30,370
Is there a phase three?

2205
01:33:31,070 --> 01:33:33,090
Yeah, when Odin sent me here.

2206
01:33:33,210 --> 01:33:38,890
I just needed answers, but you, you had to act all proud.

2207
01:33:39,630 --> 01:33:41,910
Throw whatever you have at me.

2208
01:33:42,070 --> 01:33:43,430
I'll keep coming.

2209
01:33:43,610 --> 01:33:45,710
That old body will give out.

2210
01:33:45,850 --> 01:33:50,710
But before I end this, I want you to know one thing.

2211
01:33:52,210 --> 01:33:56,230
I can't feel any of What?

2212
01:33:57,950 --> 01:33:58,710
What?

2213
01:34:00,090 --> 01:34:00,850
Oh!

2214
01:34:02,110 --> 01:34:03,610
He's a sociopath!

2215
01:34:14,290 --> 01:34:15,290
Oh, shit.

2216
01:34:15,450 --> 01:34:16,930
I gotta cry.

2217
01:34:17,350 --> 01:34:19,050
You've seen it with your own eyes.

2218
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:20,990
Oh, he meant pain.

2219
01:34:21,270 --> 01:34:22,410
Nothing can.

2220
01:34:22,850 --> 01:34:24,650
This fight is pointless.

2221
01:34:25,150 --> 01:34:27,450
Your struggle is pointless.

2222
01:34:28,170 --> 01:34:29,970
You didn't have to be this way.

2223
01:34:29,970 --> 01:34:30,970
Not like that!

2224
01:34:34,830 --> 01:34:35,830
Oh, shit!

2225
01:34:35,970 --> 01:34:36,250
Oh, shit!

2226
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:36,310
Oh, shit!

2227
01:34:38,450 --> 01:34:39,650
What is he?

2228
01:34:40,010 --> 01:34:40,930
You can't win!

2229
01:34:41,730 --> 01:34:43,910
I feel nothing!

2230
01:34:44,710 --> 01:34:46,330
He's not a sociopath.

2231
01:34:46,730 --> 01:34:47,390
He's European.

2232
01:34:48,950 --> 01:34:50,890
You're the Super Chat Cast.

2233
01:34:51,110 --> 01:34:51,690
Thank you, thank you.

2234
01:34:52,210 --> 01:34:53,450
You've given me what I wanted.

2235
01:34:53,570 --> 01:34:55,710
It wouldn't have ended this way.

2236
01:34:56,010 --> 01:34:57,010
But no!

2237
01:34:57,770 --> 01:34:59,010
He's just Scandinavian.

2238
01:35:01,250 --> 01:35:03,030
They don't see the sun.

2239
01:35:03,090 --> 01:35:03,750
It's like this.

2240
01:35:03,910 --> 01:35:06,050
Wait, I do have a Phase 3!

2241
01:35:07,050 --> 01:35:08,090
That's fucked!

2242
01:35:08,570 --> 01:35:09,410
Oh, shit!

2243
01:35:15,090 --> 01:35:15,950
Oh, my god.

2244
01:35:17,410 --> 01:35:18,610
Get out of here!

2245
01:35:19,790 --> 01:35:20,650
Get out!

2246
01:35:22,170 --> 01:35:22,730
Wow!

2247
01:35:22,910 --> 01:35:25,010
Okay, I know how to do that then.

2248
01:35:26,910 --> 01:35:27,690
God damn!

2249
01:35:27,910 --> 01:35:28,550
I'm gonna die!

2250
01:35:28,550 --> 01:35:29,670
What the fuck?

2251
01:35:29,670 --> 01:35:30,290
He stunned me.

2252
01:35:32,050 --> 01:35:32,870
Get out!

2253
01:35:33,930 --> 01:35:34,770
Get out!

2254
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:37,270
Whoa, shit!

2255
01:35:37,690 --> 01:35:38,730
That's fucking right!

2256
01:35:39,210 --> 01:35:40,150
Get out of here!

2257
01:35:41,830 --> 01:35:42,350
Bad!

2258
01:35:42,350 --> 01:35:43,190
Bad boy!

2259
01:35:44,170 --> 01:35:44,690
Okay.

2260
01:35:45,390 --> 01:35:46,670
I need to dodge here.

2261
01:35:47,890 --> 01:35:50,510
Bro, like, that's not a good thing!

2262
01:35:50,630 --> 01:35:50,970
Bro!

2263
01:35:51,250 --> 01:35:55,370
Oh, shit!

2264
01:35:55,470 --> 01:35:56,150
Every time he...

2265
01:35:56,150 --> 01:35:57,290
Okay, I got an idea.

2266
01:35:57,490 --> 01:35:58,450
I got an idea.

2267
01:35:59,210 --> 01:35:59,690
Pew!

2268
01:36:00,050 --> 01:36:00,450
Pew!

2269
01:36:02,610 --> 01:36:03,090
Pew!

2270
01:36:03,190 --> 01:36:03,450
Oh!

2271
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:04,230
Boom!

2272
01:36:04,810 --> 01:36:05,290
Bad!

2273
01:36:06,370 --> 01:36:09,310
I don't know if you know this, but that's not working!

2274
01:36:10,090 --> 01:36:10,670
Come on!

2275
01:36:10,750 --> 01:36:11,210
Get over here!

2276
01:36:11,490 --> 01:36:11,870
You know what?

2277
01:36:11,870 --> 01:36:13,210
Fuck yeah, I'll make the first move.

2278
01:36:14,710 --> 01:36:15,670
Oh, shit!

2279
01:36:16,330 --> 01:36:19,410
You have literally three moves, man!

2280
01:36:20,110 --> 01:36:21,330
You're pissing me off!

2281
01:36:24,490 --> 01:36:24,970
Oh!

2282
01:36:25,170 --> 01:36:25,650
Nice!

2283
01:36:27,450 --> 01:36:27,930
Pew!

2284
01:36:27,970 --> 01:36:28,090
Oh!

2285
01:36:28,890 --> 01:36:29,550
Oh, shit!

2286
01:36:29,630 --> 01:36:30,150
Back up!

2287
01:36:30,230 --> 01:36:30,710
Back up!

2288
01:36:31,810 --> 01:36:32,390
Come on!

2289
01:36:32,490 --> 01:36:33,130
Get over here!

2290
01:36:35,450 --> 01:36:36,310
Oh, damn!

2291
01:36:36,590 --> 01:36:37,570
Do I need to time that?

2292
01:36:40,790 --> 01:36:41,830
Get over here!

2293
01:36:42,430 --> 01:36:43,130
Come on!

2294
01:36:44,790 --> 01:36:45,550
Back off!

2295
01:36:45,810 --> 01:36:46,470
Back off!

2296
01:36:47,330 --> 01:36:48,210
Get over here!

2297
01:36:48,310 --> 01:36:50,570
I have to use my regular axe throwing!

2298
01:36:51,230 --> 01:36:52,150
Wait, where did you go?

2299
01:36:53,270 --> 01:36:53,890
Here we go.

2300
01:36:54,930 --> 01:36:56,230
Oh, I can counter it.

2301
01:36:56,290 --> 01:36:56,510
Okay.

2302
01:36:58,610 --> 01:37:00,010
Oh, there we go!

2303
01:37:00,270 --> 01:37:01,430
Oh, I see!

2304
01:37:01,790 --> 01:37:03,770
I just need to time it correctly.

2305
01:37:04,450 --> 01:37:05,030
Oh!

2306
01:37:06,110 --> 01:37:06,690
Wow!

2307
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:08,270
He can do that?

2308
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:13,200
That's fucking right.

2309
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:15,700
Come on!

2310
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:18,180
Dodge.

2311
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:23,180
Alright, now that I know I can time that, it's over for him.

2312
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:25,020
It's fucking over.

2313
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:27,220
Bro, I know you feel nothing!

2314
01:37:27,940 --> 01:37:31,840
That's an issue that you have to tell your therapist, not me!

2315
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:34,080
I'm just here to kick your ass!

2316
01:37:39,140 --> 01:37:39,660
Alright.

2317
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:45,100
He's too fast.

2318
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:49,680
He upped his agility so I can't throw my axe on him anymore.

2319
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:51,040
Break his neck!

2320
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:51,980
Break his neck!

2321
01:37:52,260 --> 01:37:52,820
Do it!

2322
01:37:53,260 --> 01:37:54,220
Yeah, do it!

2323
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:56,800
Regenerate this!

2324
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:58,540
Oh, shit.

2325
01:37:59,480 --> 01:38:00,280
That's right.

2326
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:02,540
Can't regenerate if you can't breathe!

2327
01:38:06,740 --> 01:38:08,020
UFC moment!

2328
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:10,160
Tap out!

2329
01:38:10,300 --> 01:38:11,060
Tap out, fool!

2330
01:38:15,020 --> 01:38:15,660
Yeah!

2331
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,980
Regenerate your fucking neck, bitch!

2332
01:38:28,250 --> 01:38:29,610
You didn't tap out.

2333
01:38:30,530 --> 01:38:31,370
Could've tapped out!

2334
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:38,300
And he is out.

2335
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:39,940
I'll never know who he was.

2336
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:42,700
It was good sparring partner dough.

2337
01:38:46,750 --> 01:38:49,330
That was male therapy!

2338
01:38:52,270 --> 01:38:53,750
Who was he?

2339
01:38:53,890 --> 01:38:55,150
Yeah, which Greek god was he?

2340
01:38:58,510 --> 01:38:59,150
Alright.

2341
01:38:59,270 --> 01:38:59,890
Don't worry.

2342
01:39:00,070 --> 01:39:00,590
That's not fair.

2343
01:39:01,110 --> 01:39:04,170
Why can't I regenerate just like him?

2344
01:39:04,430 --> 01:39:05,430
I'm Greek.

2345
01:39:06,410 --> 01:39:07,050
Anyway.

2346
01:39:11,430 --> 01:39:13,190
Oh, is that the one I banged?

2347
01:39:15,010 --> 01:39:17,170
That's our dead wife.

2348
01:39:30,540 --> 01:39:31,460
Oh, wait!

2349
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:32,040
I did!

2350
01:39:32,780 --> 01:39:36,240
I regenerate so hard that there's less blood on me now.

2351
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:39,360
That's how regeneration works.

2352
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:43,280
How did I have less blood in three seconds?

2353
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:44,820
And the blood is gone!

2354
01:39:49,540 --> 01:39:52,040
And the blood is now gone.

2355
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:52,860
Damn.

2356
01:39:53,140 --> 01:39:55,920
I absorbed it into my body.

2357
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:01,600
It just works.

2358
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:03,320
I just absorbed it back in.

2359
01:40:04,580 --> 01:40:06,180
That's how my regeneration works.

2360
01:40:09,100 --> 01:40:10,060
Knock knock.

2361
01:40:10,540 --> 01:40:12,820
But we cannot stay here.

2362
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:14,800
Boy, we have to leave, boy.

2363
01:40:14,820 --> 01:40:16,120
They found out where we live.

2364
01:40:17,060 --> 01:40:20,100
We don't actually have to passports to live here.

2365
01:40:22,900 --> 01:40:24,760
A lot of skin care.

2366
01:40:35,750 --> 01:40:36,770
That's right, boy.

2367
01:40:37,790 --> 01:40:41,210
I've killed other gods before that they made three games of it.

2368
01:40:42,430 --> 01:40:48,210
Do you think since the god is from Scandinavia that it'll be different?

2369
01:41:26,350 --> 01:41:27,210
Yay!

2370
01:41:28,310 --> 01:41:29,730
Defend your home!

2371
01:41:30,510 --> 01:41:31,950
I got an achievement!

2372
01:41:37,710 --> 01:41:41,090
I won a UFC match against Conor McGregor.

2373
01:41:41,170 --> 01:41:42,430
That's what happened.

2374
01:41:47,090 --> 01:41:48,030
New entry.

2375
01:41:48,230 --> 01:41:53,630
A strange man covered in tattoos came to the house and I don't have to pay Cable for it!

2376
01:41:54,030 --> 01:41:54,790
That's great!

2377
01:41:57,350 --> 01:41:58,870
An attacked father.

2378
01:41:59,210 --> 01:42:00,850
It must have been some fight.

2379
01:42:01,050 --> 01:42:01,850
Everything's broken.

2380
01:42:02,610 --> 01:42:07,110
Father said I wasn't ready earlier, but something about killing this stranger changed his mind, I guess.

2381
01:42:07,230 --> 01:42:08,030
Who was he?

2382
01:42:08,130 --> 01:42:09,470
What did he want with us?

2383
01:42:09,610 --> 01:42:11,210
We're nobodies.

2384
01:42:11,850 --> 01:42:12,290
Okay.

2385
01:42:14,090 --> 01:42:15,330
Wings, thank you for the super chat.

2386
01:42:15,390 --> 01:42:16,230
Thank you, thank you.

2387
01:42:16,630 --> 01:42:23,130
I had you on while I was cooking and it was just loud enough to hear, but not loud enough to hear what you were saying.

2388
01:42:23,370 --> 01:42:26,070
Roommates asked what gym bro are you watching?

2389
01:42:27,410 --> 01:42:28,690
Thank you for the super chat.

2390
01:42:28,790 --> 01:42:29,550
Thank you, thank you.

2391
01:42:33,210 --> 01:42:34,030
That's right, boy.

2392
01:42:34,590 --> 01:42:37,630
And you too will kill your next god as well.

2393
01:42:41,010 --> 01:42:41,450
Yay!

2394
01:42:41,930 --> 01:42:42,930
You could've died.

2395
01:42:48,190 --> 01:42:49,570
Don't worry, son.

2396
01:42:49,970 --> 01:42:51,350
I'll make sure you die.

2397
01:42:53,850 --> 01:42:55,210
That's so fucked.

2398
01:42:55,230 --> 01:42:55,930
Like, why?

2399
01:43:14,430 --> 01:43:16,690
Our boy was like, don't leave me alone.

2400
01:43:16,890 --> 01:43:17,490
I was like, fine!

2401
01:43:18,190 --> 01:43:19,210
I don't wanna get in the fight!

2402
01:43:21,070 --> 01:43:21,590
That's what.

2403
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:24,370
Close your heart to the suffering.

2404
01:43:25,070 --> 01:43:26,110
Holy shit!

2405
01:43:27,670 --> 01:43:28,610
I mean, okay.

2406
01:43:28,810 --> 01:43:29,610
Alright, dad.

2407
01:43:30,430 --> 01:43:32,850
Get rid of all feelings when you kill.

2408
01:43:33,750 --> 01:43:35,370
So you can kill more.

2409
01:43:37,610 --> 01:43:38,510
Oh, there's money.

2410
01:43:39,550 --> 01:43:40,070
Money!

2411
01:43:41,210 --> 01:43:43,390
He's dead, so he doesn't need the money anymore.

2412
01:43:44,330 --> 01:43:45,750
Keep that shit up.

2413
01:43:45,930 --> 01:43:47,490
Oh, my axe was never with me.

2414
01:43:48,190 --> 01:43:51,370
I summoned it all the way from where I killed Conor McGregor.

2415
01:43:52,750 --> 01:43:53,650
There you have it.

2416
01:43:53,690 --> 01:43:57,470
For those who don't know who Conor McGregor is, he is a very famous boxing person.

2417
01:44:00,790 --> 01:44:01,270
Um...

2418
01:44:03,130 --> 01:44:04,090
Let's see...

2419
01:44:06,310 --> 01:44:07,550
What do I have to do from that?

2420
01:44:09,970 --> 01:44:11,270
Or UFC person.

2421
01:44:12,230 --> 01:44:15,370
Sorry, things with fists all blur together for me.

2422
01:44:15,370 --> 01:44:16,070
Uh...

2423
01:44:20,710 --> 01:44:24,250
I just see all of them as fists.

2424
01:44:25,090 --> 01:44:27,750
They do something with their fists so they all blur in.

2425
01:44:33,030 --> 01:44:34,230
Good idea!

2426
01:44:36,250 --> 01:44:36,850
Alright.

2427
01:44:36,970 --> 01:44:37,490
Here we go.

2428
01:44:38,450 --> 01:44:40,070
Wait, what did I do?

2429
01:44:41,410 --> 01:44:42,010
Okay.

2430
01:44:42,010 --> 01:44:42,990
The Fisters.

2431
01:44:43,750 --> 01:44:45,410
He's just a famous Fister.

2432
01:44:48,350 --> 01:44:49,530
What did I do?

2433
01:44:49,810 --> 01:44:50,790
Command to drop...

2434
01:44:50,790 --> 01:44:51,530
Oh, this.

2435
01:44:51,710 --> 01:44:52,010
Okay.

2436
01:44:54,630 --> 01:44:55,330
Here we go.

2437
01:44:59,830 --> 01:45:00,390
Alright.

2438
01:45:00,610 --> 01:45:01,130
Let's go.

2439
01:45:03,630 --> 01:45:04,190
Yay!

2440
01:45:06,330 --> 01:45:07,910
Kickboxing just doesn't exist.

2441
01:45:08,090 --> 01:45:10,110
Thank you for the super chat.

2442
01:45:10,190 --> 01:45:10,610
Thank you.

2443
01:45:24,830 --> 01:45:28,130
This is a really good video.

2444
01:45:28,130 --> 01:45:30,690
I really, really appreciate it.

2445
01:45:33,570 --> 01:45:36,450
And please, I'm really very glad that you saw the video.

2446
01:45:36,470 --> 01:45:37,990
I personally like the content of this video.

2447
01:45:37,990 --> 01:45:38,230
I really, really appreciate it.

2448
01:45:38,250 --> 01:45:40,090
Make sure you have a great day and

2449
01:45:43,890 --> 01:45:44,370
Bye!

2450
01:45:44,370 --> 01:45:45,510
Alright, was that it?

2451
01:45:45,730 --> 01:45:47,110
Did I just do that for loot?

2452
01:45:49,450 --> 01:45:50,650
Okay, I need to do this.

2453
01:45:51,370 --> 01:45:51,930
Alright.

2454
01:45:56,330 --> 01:45:59,230
Because I care, unlike those Norse gods.

2455
01:46:01,910 --> 01:46:02,830
Alright, nice.

2456
01:46:05,070 --> 01:46:06,850
Where am I supposed to go?

2457
01:46:10,370 --> 01:46:10,950
The fuck?

2458
01:46:13,330 --> 01:46:16,390
Was there something over there originally?

2459
01:46:19,050 --> 01:46:21,290
Oh, I was supposed to go to my child.

2460
01:46:22,690 --> 01:46:24,890
Sorry, I got distracted by loot as always.

2461
01:46:25,250 --> 01:46:29,390
I got distracted by loot.

2462
01:46:30,830 --> 01:46:33,070
The loot goblin ran strong in me.

2463
01:46:34,750 --> 01:46:35,970
Alright, look up where?

2464
01:46:37,770 --> 01:46:38,970
Alright, let's grab this.

2465
01:46:40,230 --> 01:46:40,930
Alright, I'll just go to the other side.

2466
01:46:40,950 --> 01:46:41,350
Up we go.

2467
01:46:43,070 --> 01:46:44,990
I don't know what to use this loot for yet.

2468
01:46:46,270 --> 01:46:46,710
What?

2469
01:46:46,710 --> 01:46:47,130
Jump.

2470
01:46:48,970 --> 01:46:50,610
What am I supposed to do?

2471
01:46:51,430 --> 01:46:51,870
Jump!

2472
01:46:52,210 --> 01:46:54,890
Alright, yeah, the quick time event didn't show up.

2473
01:46:54,990 --> 01:46:58,010
Or not quick time, the button prompt didn't show up there.

2474
01:46:58,290 --> 01:46:58,930
That's weird.

2475
01:47:03,650 --> 01:47:04,090
What?

2476
01:47:04,350 --> 01:47:04,650
What?

2477
01:47:04,710 --> 01:47:05,570
We don't own anything.

2478
01:47:08,570 --> 01:47:09,450
We don't own anything.

2479
01:47:09,450 --> 01:47:09,570
We don't own anything.

2480
01:47:09,570 --> 01:47:10,790
How are they supposed to rob us?

2481
01:47:10,790 --> 01:47:10,910
How are they supposed to rob us?

2482
01:47:10,910 --> 01:47:11,790
We don't own anything.

2483
01:47:11,990 --> 01:47:14,010
Oh wait, is that the faster way to do it?

2484
01:47:14,730 --> 01:47:15,170
What?

2485
01:47:17,790 --> 01:47:19,730
Oh, there was a shortcut there.

2486
01:47:20,410 --> 01:47:21,510
I didn't even notice.

2487
01:47:21,830 --> 01:47:23,250
Yeah, boy, we're broke as fuck.

2488
01:47:23,350 --> 01:47:24,270
We don't own anything.

2489
01:47:25,270 --> 01:47:26,370
Rob us of what?

2490
01:47:30,430 --> 01:47:31,150
Alright, nice.

2491
01:47:31,170 --> 01:47:32,330
We have another shortcut here.

2492
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:36,560
Let's see.

2493
01:47:36,860 --> 01:47:39,820
I gotta make sure I got everything.

2494
01:47:40,780 --> 01:47:41,220
Alright.

2495
01:47:42,220 --> 01:47:42,700
Alright.

2496
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:46,600
Let's go up.

2497
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:49,460
Darkblade, thank you for the super chat.

2498
01:47:49,540 --> 01:47:50,400
Thank you, thank you.

2499
01:47:50,440 --> 01:47:55,060
TLDR, Aeris made Kratos rage and see his wife and kids as enemies so he killed them.

2500
01:47:55,300 --> 01:47:57,100
Their ashes went into Kratos' skin.

2501
01:47:57,280 --> 01:47:59,080
Oh, they're literally on me!

2502
01:47:59,380 --> 01:48:04,900
So my dead wife and chi- I'm like feeding my dead wife and child of god blood.

2503
01:48:05,340 --> 01:48:07,160
So they'll be satisfied.

2504
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:08,680
They're always hungry.

2505
01:48:09,940 --> 01:48:10,980
Thank you for the super chat.

2506
01:48:11,060 --> 01:48:11,720
Thank you, thank you.

2507
01:48:11,940 --> 01:48:13,040
Did you cut those down?

2508
01:48:15,260 --> 01:48:18,640
I gotta feed my dead wife and child.

2509
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:19,900
They're hungry.

2510
01:48:20,740 --> 01:48:22,420
Always so hungry.

2511
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:35,100
That's why the blood disappeared so fast.

2512
01:48:40,950 --> 01:48:41,590
Alright.

2513
01:48:41,590 --> 01:48:42,510
Let's see.

2514
01:48:44,170 --> 01:48:45,190
Alright, let's go.

2515
01:48:45,370 --> 01:48:46,230
Let's go, child.

2516
01:48:46,470 --> 01:48:49,250
Gotta beat up some rocks real- Beat up some boxes real fast.

2517
01:48:50,830 --> 01:48:52,130
Uh... this way.

2518
01:48:52,670 --> 01:48:53,450
Alright, boy!

2519
01:48:53,690 --> 01:48:54,230
Come on!

2520
01:48:54,290 --> 01:48:55,250
You can jump, boy!

2521
01:48:56,370 --> 01:48:57,050
Come on!

2522
01:48:57,150 --> 01:48:58,070
Do what daddy did!

2523
01:48:58,450 --> 01:48:58,990
Nice.

2524
01:49:02,170 --> 01:49:02,730
Alright.

2525
01:49:02,930 --> 01:49:04,470
Am I skinny enough for this?

2526
01:49:04,850 --> 01:49:05,410
Damn.

2527
01:49:06,070 --> 01:49:07,610
It just fit my chest.

2528
01:49:08,090 --> 01:49:09,250
I do not know.

2529
01:49:10,650 --> 01:49:11,790
Before winter falls?

2530
01:49:12,110 --> 01:49:13,150
I do not know.

2531
01:49:13,510 --> 01:49:13,990
Okay, okay.

2532
01:49:17,330 --> 01:49:18,370
Alright, boy!

2533
01:49:19,350 --> 01:49:20,530
They don't see us.

2534
01:49:21,090 --> 01:49:21,890
Should I fire?

2535
01:49:21,990 --> 01:49:22,430
Yes.

2536
01:49:22,470 --> 01:49:23,690
Wait for my mark.

2537
01:49:23,890 --> 01:49:24,370
Yes.

2538
01:49:25,230 --> 01:49:26,370
That's my mark.

2539
01:49:26,530 --> 01:49:26,910
We're all around here!

2540
01:49:29,950 --> 01:49:33,270
Yes, we always kill.

2541
01:49:34,210 --> 01:49:34,810
Yes!

2542
01:49:35,890 --> 01:49:37,410
You got this, boy!

2543
01:49:38,170 --> 01:49:39,390
You got this!

2544
01:49:40,010 --> 01:49:40,970
You're ready!

2545
01:49:41,730 --> 01:49:43,690
It's not like you'll die or anything.

2546
01:49:44,350 --> 01:49:45,510
You can't die.

2547
01:49:45,630 --> 01:49:47,190
You're just a figment of my imagination.

2548
01:49:47,190 --> 01:49:50,150
Of my guilt of letting my wife die.

2549
01:49:51,430 --> 01:49:52,350
I'm just...

2550
01:49:53,870 --> 01:49:54,930
There you go.

2551
01:49:55,310 --> 01:49:56,230
Boy, attack!

2552
01:49:56,990 --> 01:49:58,510
Keep attacking, boy!

2553
01:49:59,290 --> 01:49:59,850
Never...

2554
01:49:59,850 --> 01:50:00,330
Boy!

2555
01:50:00,510 --> 01:50:01,830
This is why you're not ready!

2556
01:50:01,930 --> 01:50:03,170
I literally saw you miss!

2557
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:08,860
Wait, what?

2558
01:50:11,380 --> 01:50:12,500
Oh, shit!

2559
01:50:12,580 --> 01:50:13,920
They get fired back?

2560
01:50:14,260 --> 01:50:15,680
Okay, that is like...

2561
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:17,060
So slow, though.

2562
01:50:20,180 --> 01:50:21,100
Alright, boy.

2563
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:24,760
Boy, you could have done that a little faster.

2564
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:28,360
Threat indicators point towards off-screen.

2565
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:30,520
Gold signifies nearby enemies.

2566
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:32,880
Red signifies purple.

2567
01:50:33,680 --> 01:50:35,460
Indicates an incoming projectile.

2568
01:50:35,580 --> 01:50:36,580
Wait, they're all dead, though.

2569
01:50:37,900 --> 01:50:38,420
Ooh!

2570
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:41,020
Okay, I don't think I need that at all.

2571
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:42,460
Wait, is there more?

2572
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:43,980
Oh, shit!

2573
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:45,360
Goodbye!

2574
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:47,120
There was more.

2575
01:50:48,580 --> 01:50:49,420
Oh, shit!

2576
01:50:49,480 --> 01:50:50,300
Oh, shit!

2577
01:50:50,380 --> 01:50:50,720
Okay!

2578
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:52,160
Alright.

2579
01:50:52,280 --> 01:50:53,620
Gotta get you out of the way.

2580
01:50:53,860 --> 01:50:54,340
Sorry.

2581
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:56,480
I need you further away so I can do this.

2582
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:00,100
Come on!

2583
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:00,620
Keep shooting!

2584
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:01,260
Keep shooting!

2585
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:03,900
Come on!

2586
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:04,780
Just keep shooting!

2587
01:51:07,120 --> 01:51:07,780
It's alright!

2588
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:08,520
You can die!

2589
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:09,980
You're nearly invincible!

2590
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:12,440
Take every... hit!

2591
01:51:13,020 --> 01:51:14,140
Oh, shit!

2592
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:14,740
Not me!

2593
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:19,120
Guys!

2594
01:51:20,860 --> 01:51:21,460
Go!

2595
01:51:21,660 --> 01:51:21,960
Go!

2596
01:51:22,060 --> 01:51:22,620
Go, boy!

2597
01:51:22,700 --> 01:51:23,080
Go!

2598
01:51:29,210 --> 01:51:30,310
You got this!

2599
01:51:32,010 --> 01:51:33,470
I believe in you!

2600
01:51:33,630 --> 01:51:34,350
Just keep shooting!

2601
01:51:36,030 --> 01:51:37,770
Just... just keep shooting!

2602
01:51:40,450 --> 01:51:41,650
Oh, shit!

2603
01:51:41,770 --> 01:51:42,550
That's fine.

2604
01:51:42,630 --> 01:51:43,190
I'll be okay.

2605
01:51:44,050 --> 01:51:44,890
That's fine.

2606
01:51:44,970 --> 01:51:45,610
I'll be okay.

2607
01:51:47,770 --> 01:51:48,370
Okay.

2608
01:51:49,270 --> 01:51:49,870
Alright.

2609
01:51:49,870 --> 01:51:50,070
Alright.

2610
01:51:50,150 --> 01:51:50,850
This guy.

2611
01:51:52,390 --> 01:51:52,870
Alright.

2612
01:51:52,910 --> 01:51:53,830
I know he can't hit.

2613
01:51:55,170 --> 01:51:55,890
There we go.

2614
01:51:56,730 --> 01:51:57,610
Oh, my God!

2615
01:51:57,670 --> 01:51:58,630
How are you still alive?

2616
01:51:58,810 --> 01:51:59,670
You're so weak!

2617
01:52:01,730 --> 01:52:02,470
That's fine!

2618
01:52:02,770 --> 01:52:03,390
Boy, please!

2619
01:52:05,370 --> 01:52:05,850
Alright.

2620
01:52:05,970 --> 01:52:06,610
Last guy.

2621
01:52:06,770 --> 01:52:07,390
Where are you?

2622
01:52:08,070 --> 01:52:10,110
You're so lucky there's a tree there.

2623
01:52:10,730 --> 01:52:11,830
You're so lucky.

2624
01:52:13,670 --> 01:52:14,530
There we go.

2625
01:52:15,010 --> 01:52:15,490
Nice!

2626
01:52:16,730 --> 01:52:17,510
That was easy.

2627
01:52:18,770 --> 01:52:19,850
And we got X-Men!

2628
01:52:19,850 --> 01:52:20,530
We got XP from that!

2629
01:52:22,410 --> 01:52:23,550
Try light throws.

2630
01:52:23,670 --> 01:52:24,130
It's faster.

2631
01:52:24,750 --> 01:52:27,270
Whoever is not my focus should be yours.

2632
01:52:27,410 --> 01:52:29,090
But only when safe to do so.

2633
01:52:29,690 --> 01:52:32,370
Yeah, but it's not not as strong though.

2634
01:52:33,450 --> 01:52:35,070
But it's not as strong.

2635
01:52:36,290 --> 01:52:36,970
What's this?

2636
01:52:37,310 --> 01:52:38,090
Boy, read!

2637
01:52:40,310 --> 01:52:41,190
Read, boy!

2638
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:46,220
What does it say?

2639
01:52:46,660 --> 01:52:47,200
Yetnar.

2640
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:48,100
Giants.

2641
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:49,780
You can read the writing.

2642
01:52:50,100 --> 01:52:50,540
Some.

2643
01:52:51,240 --> 01:52:52,620
Just the language is mother now.

2644
01:52:53,300 --> 01:52:54,020
But they're all...

2645
01:52:54,020 --> 01:52:54,780
Alright.

2646
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:58,580
Would have connected so sometimes I can feel my way through stuff I shouldn't know.

2647
01:52:59,180 --> 01:52:59,760
You know?

2648
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:02,340
What's this?

2649
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:03,700
Okay, so...

2650
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:07,140
I need to make sure that I'm not missing anything here.

2651
01:53:08,180 --> 01:53:10,060
I want to make sure that I got everything.

2652
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:11,520
Oh, loot!

2653
01:53:12,060 --> 01:53:12,500
Nice.

2654
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:16,000
I don't know when I'll ever use this loot yet.

2655
01:53:16,180 --> 01:53:17,200
But I love loot.

2656
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:19,200
I love to loot.

2657
01:53:19,480 --> 01:53:19,980
Oh, wait.

2658
01:53:19,980 --> 01:53:20,580
There's jars.

2659
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:22,420
There has to be stuff in jars, right?

2660
01:53:22,740 --> 01:53:23,740
Yeah, I knew it.

2661
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:25,480
I knew there's gold in here.

2662
01:53:27,860 --> 01:53:28,740
Fae is...

2663
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:31,200
Fae is Nordic, right?

2664
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:33,820
I always like...

2665
01:53:33,820 --> 01:53:35,900
I read so much about Greek...

2666
01:53:35,900 --> 01:53:40,440
Not Greek, but like gods and goddesses in general that I sometimes get confused which is which.

2667
01:53:42,160 --> 01:53:44,020
Because they all blur together for me.

2668
01:53:44,160 --> 01:53:44,360
Yeah.

2669
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:47,340
Oh, so I banged a Nordic goddess!

2670
01:53:50,720 --> 01:53:52,300
What the fuck are you?

2671
01:53:52,940 --> 01:53:54,400
Wait, can you be hit?

2672
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:54,880
Oh, wait!

2673
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:55,340
That's the...

2674
01:53:55,340 --> 01:53:56,380
The yo...

2675
01:53:56,380 --> 01:53:56,720
Whatever?

2676
01:53:57,460 --> 01:53:58,100
The...

2677
01:53:58,100 --> 01:53:59,180
What Loki is?

2678
01:53:59,340 --> 01:53:59,800
The...

2679
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:00,400
Yoner?

2680
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:01,040
What?

2681
01:54:01,140 --> 01:54:01,540
I can...

2682
01:54:01,540 --> 01:54:01,860
Yoren?

2683
01:54:02,180 --> 01:54:03,900
I don't know how to pronounce it.

2684
01:54:04,100 --> 01:54:05,380
They're the frost giants!

2685
01:54:07,180 --> 01:54:08,620
That's the frost giants.

2686
01:54:09,020 --> 01:54:09,540
Yeah!

2687
01:54:14,750 --> 01:54:15,990
The yo something!

2688
01:54:18,210 --> 01:54:20,710
Oh, they're ice giants!

2689
01:54:20,710 --> 01:54:22,030
They're zombies, but they're blue!

2690
01:54:23,670 --> 01:54:24,790
How dare they?

2691
01:54:24,950 --> 01:54:26,190
But they're blue though!

2692
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:40,380
An extremely quick burst of energy that interrupts and knocks back all nearby enemies?

2693
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:41,740
Wait, how do I do that?

2694
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:45,180
You have acquired a Hell's Touch Light runic.

2695
01:54:45,420 --> 01:54:50,900
Runic gems allows you to customize your weapons to enable light and heavy runic attack.

2696
01:54:51,540 --> 01:54:53,720
Look down to access the...

2697
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:54,180
Oh.

2698
01:54:55,460 --> 01:54:56,080
Oh!

2699
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:57,120
Wait, no.

2700
01:54:57,200 --> 01:54:58,260
I don't want it to be light.

2701
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:01,460
XP to upgrade.

2702
01:55:02,060 --> 01:55:03,140
Improves their attributes.

2703
01:55:03,260 --> 01:55:04,720
Press X to equip it.

2704
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:06,400
Okay.

2705
01:55:09,100 --> 01:55:11,100
Okay, I don't want this to be...

2706
01:55:12,340 --> 01:55:16,380
Wait, how do I remove it?

2707
01:55:18,860 --> 01:55:20,720
Press L1 to R1.

2708
01:55:21,880 --> 01:55:23,120
Not enough XP.

2709
01:55:25,420 --> 01:55:25,940
Uh...

2710
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:26,460
Finalize!

2711
01:55:26,460 --> 01:55:27,180
Thank you for the super chat!

2712
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:27,580
Thank you!

2713
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:28,100
Thank you!

2714
01:55:28,180 --> 01:55:30,780
Another game similar to God of War is a serious rap.

2715
01:55:31,180 --> 01:55:35,520
Synopsis for both is literally just Florida man too angry to die.

2716
01:55:35,940 --> 01:55:36,960
Thank you for the super chat!

2717
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:37,440
Thank you!

2718
01:55:37,460 --> 01:55:37,960
Thank you!

2719
01:55:38,340 --> 01:55:39,640
Okay, I need to remember...

2720
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:40,780
I need to remember this.

2721
01:55:42,040 --> 01:55:42,460
Whoa!

2722
01:55:45,160 --> 01:55:46,320
Do I recharge it?

2723
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:51,160
All right.

2724
01:55:53,980 --> 01:55:54,820
Let's see.

2725
01:55:55,180 --> 01:55:56,060
All right, up we go.

2726
01:55:56,060 --> 01:55:57,060
Move.

2727
01:55:58,780 --> 01:55:59,300
Thanks.

2728
01:55:59,940 --> 01:56:02,590
There's the mountain!

2729
01:56:02,810 --> 01:56:03,270
Let's go!

2730
01:56:03,590 --> 01:56:04,390
Not yet!

2731
01:56:04,750 --> 01:56:06,230
What am I waiting for?

2732
01:56:06,910 --> 01:56:07,950
It's five!

2733
01:56:08,430 --> 01:56:10,430
Let me jump on...

2734
01:56:10,430 --> 01:56:13,310
You fucking idiot!

2735
01:56:18,670 --> 01:56:20,050
You're so...

2736
01:56:20,050 --> 01:56:22,150
You're so stupid.

2737
01:56:22,830 --> 01:56:24,550
You're so stupid.

2738
01:56:25,010 --> 01:56:26,910
Survival of the fittest boy.

2739
01:56:27,310 --> 01:56:28,290
Oh, yeah.

2740
01:56:28,490 --> 01:56:29,190
Okay.

2741
01:56:29,190 --> 01:56:29,450
Okay.

2742
01:56:29,450 --> 01:56:29,830
Okay.

2743
01:56:29,830 --> 01:56:31,750
Survival of the fittest.

2744
01:56:33,430 --> 01:56:34,290
All right.

2745
01:56:34,350 --> 01:56:34,830
Don't worry.

2746
01:56:35,610 --> 01:56:37,250
I'm coming over.

2747
01:56:37,710 --> 01:56:37,730
Hang on!

2748
01:56:37,950 --> 01:56:39,050
I'm coming!

2749
01:56:41,250 --> 01:56:42,690
Stay calm!

2750
01:56:43,230 --> 01:56:44,370
Almost there!

2751
01:56:44,450 --> 01:56:45,610
You need to learn.

2752
01:56:46,510 --> 01:56:51,270
Never jump on the middle of the bridge to test it out!

2753
01:56:55,010 --> 01:56:56,870
That wasn't so bad.

2754
01:56:57,130 --> 01:56:57,830
Slow.

2755
01:56:58,010 --> 01:56:58,630
Down.

2756
01:56:58,990 --> 01:56:59,170
Yeah.

2757
01:56:59,170 --> 01:56:59,190
Slow down.

2758
01:56:59,190 --> 01:56:59,250
Slow down.

2759
01:56:59,250 --> 01:56:59,350
Slow down.

2760
01:56:59,350 --> 01:57:00,990
Your haste will cost us.

2761
01:57:02,330 --> 01:57:02,870
Sorry.

2762
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:07,980
Ugh.

2763
01:57:08,440 --> 01:57:09,500
More draugr.

2764
01:57:09,980 --> 01:57:11,080
But these aren't moving.

2765
01:57:11,720 --> 01:57:12,620
Are they dead?

2766
01:57:12,920 --> 01:57:13,720
I mean...

2767
01:57:13,720 --> 01:57:14,700
More dead?

2768
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:16,140
Yeah.

2769
01:57:16,140 --> 01:57:16,840
Why aren't they moving?

2770
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:19,120
Don't touch the...

2771
01:57:19,120 --> 01:57:19,380
Boy!

2772
01:57:21,600 --> 01:57:24,040
By color and number near their health bar.

2773
01:57:24,220 --> 01:57:28,580
The color and health range from green to purple depending on how powerful they are compared to Kratos.

2774
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:30,960
That's right, boy.

2775
01:57:31,120 --> 01:57:31,280
That's right.

2776
01:57:32,860 --> 01:57:34,260
That's fucking right, boy.

2777
01:57:35,260 --> 01:57:36,040
Oh, wait.

2778
01:57:36,180 --> 01:57:36,380
Wait.

2779
01:57:36,460 --> 01:57:38,180
I like the faster one better, actually.

2780
01:57:38,260 --> 01:57:38,640
You're right.

2781
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:40,440
Whoever said try to do faster?

2782
01:57:41,740 --> 01:57:42,500
You're right.

2783
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:44,600
I should...

2784
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:45,380
You know what?

2785
01:57:45,560 --> 01:57:46,360
This is easier.

2786
01:57:49,960 --> 01:57:51,340
This is much...

2787
01:57:51,340 --> 01:57:51,460
Oh!

2788
01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:52,320
But the fast...

2789
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:54,260
The heavy one does...

2790
01:57:54,260 --> 01:57:55,200
Alright.

2791
01:57:55,340 --> 01:57:58,360
The fast one, he'd be like, get away!

2792
01:57:58,660 --> 01:57:59,380
Get away!

2793
01:57:59,740 --> 01:58:00,500
Get away!

2794
01:58:00,760 --> 01:58:01,260
Get away!

2795
01:58:01,280 --> 01:58:01,600
Get away.

2796
01:58:01,600 --> 01:58:02,260
Get away.

2797
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:03,120
Get away!

2798
01:58:03,380 --> 01:58:03,580
Ha!

2799
01:58:03,700 --> 01:58:04,000
Ha!

2800
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:04,160
Ha!

2801
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:04,380
Okay.

2802
01:58:04,780 --> 01:58:06,700
Then I'll use this.

2803
01:58:06,980 --> 01:58:07,780
Get away!

2804
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:14,000
That's...

2805
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:15,060
That's stupid.

2806
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:18,380
Get away!

2807
01:58:18,620 --> 01:58:19,920
Get away from here!

2808
01:58:20,440 --> 01:58:21,540
Don't touchy!

2809
01:58:21,820 --> 01:58:23,480
No touchy!

2810
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:26,880
No touchy.

2811
01:58:27,380 --> 01:58:27,480
No touchy!

2812
01:58:27,480 --> 01:58:28,140
Ha!

2813
01:58:29,820 --> 01:58:31,260
No touchy.

2814
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:32,780
No touch.

2815
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:32,800
No touch.

2816
01:58:32,860 --> 01:58:33,360
Oh shit.

2817
01:58:34,020 --> 01:58:36,660
Okay, maybe I gotta get rid of you first.

2818
01:58:37,120 --> 01:58:37,960
No touch.

2819
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:39,840
No touch.

2820
01:58:42,260 --> 01:58:43,020
Oh shit.

2821
01:58:43,500 --> 01:58:44,240
Oh shit.

2822
01:58:45,180 --> 01:58:45,840
Get away.

2823
01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:47,300
Bad.

2824
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:50,540
Okay, you two up there.

2825
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:52,180
You're the weaker ones.

2826
01:58:52,320 --> 01:58:53,900
So I'm going to get rid of you guys first.

2827
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:56,600
There we go.

2828
01:58:56,820 --> 01:58:57,740
What are you trying to do?

2829
01:58:57,800 --> 01:58:57,960
Huh?

2830
01:58:58,020 --> 01:58:58,880
What are you trying to do?

2831
01:58:58,900 --> 01:58:59,140
Huh?

2832
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:01,080
What are you trying to do?

2833
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:02,380
You idiots.

2834
01:59:03,960 --> 01:59:04,640
Get away.

2835
01:59:05,020 --> 01:59:05,760
There you go.

2836
01:59:09,780 --> 01:59:10,260
Nice.

2837
01:59:12,180 --> 01:59:13,220
Just gotta make sure.

2838
01:59:16,660 --> 01:59:19,460
Alright, I just want to make sure that there's no evil guys here.

2839
01:59:22,380 --> 01:59:22,860
Alright.

2840
01:59:22,860 --> 01:59:23,720
That was easy.

2841
01:59:26,140 --> 01:59:27,680
Alright, no touchy.

2842
01:59:28,640 --> 01:59:29,340
Look at what?

2843
01:59:29,580 --> 01:59:30,000
Yeah?

2844
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:30,980
Read.

2845
01:59:31,680 --> 01:59:32,320
Read.

2846
01:59:32,380 --> 01:59:32,560
Read, boy.

2847
01:59:44,440 --> 01:59:45,080
Oh.

2848
01:59:45,560 --> 01:59:47,040
Found what used to be...

2849
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:48,660
Found what used to be a marketplace.

2850
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:49,340
Okay.

2851
01:59:50,940 --> 01:59:51,580
What?

2852
01:59:53,060 --> 01:59:53,700
What?

2853
01:59:54,040 --> 01:59:54,680
What?

2854
01:59:55,300 --> 01:59:55,940
Where?

2855
01:59:56,700 --> 01:59:57,020
Oh.

2856
01:59:59,620 --> 02:00:00,260
Cool.

2857
02:00:02,660 --> 02:00:03,820
Oh, shit.

2858
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:05,820
You big boy.

2859
02:00:07,180 --> 02:00:07,700
It's alright.

2860
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:08,120
Goodbye.

2861
02:00:09,660 --> 02:00:10,380
Okay.

2862
02:00:12,020 --> 02:00:12,740
Alright.

2863
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:14,520
Alright.

2864
02:00:15,900 --> 02:00:16,620
Okay.

2865
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:18,000
Okay.

2866
02:00:18,460 --> 02:00:19,540
Oh, there's more!

2867
02:00:20,180 --> 02:00:21,220
Oh, shit!

2868
02:00:22,900 --> 02:00:23,620
Okay.

2869
02:00:25,200 --> 02:00:26,680
I did not expect more.

2870
02:00:26,780 --> 02:00:28,400
I thought it was one guy.

2871
02:00:28,980 --> 02:00:29,820
It's fine.

2872
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:32,580
How is there so many?

2873
02:00:32,580 --> 02:00:33,520
What?

2874
02:00:35,640 --> 02:00:36,640
Oh, my God!

2875
02:00:36,900 --> 02:00:40,340
How am I supposed to abuse my axe when there's so many of you guys?

2876
02:00:41,600 --> 02:00:42,420
It's fine.

2877
02:00:43,340 --> 02:00:43,900
Whoa.

2878
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:44,720
Whoa.

2879
02:00:44,940 --> 02:00:45,500
Whoa.

2880
02:00:45,780 --> 02:00:47,760
Please don't make me do this.

2881
02:00:48,460 --> 02:00:49,500
Because I win.

2882
02:00:51,480 --> 02:00:52,040
Okay.

2883
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:54,240
I guess I will melee you all.

2884
02:00:54,500 --> 02:00:55,020
Oh.

2885
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:56,560
Okay.

2886
02:00:57,280 --> 02:00:57,840
Alright.

2887
02:00:57,980 --> 02:00:58,960
You made me angry.

2888
02:01:00,900 --> 02:01:02,560
You made me angry.

2889
02:01:02,580 --> 02:01:03,040
You made me angry now.

2890
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:07,440
I will fight you with my gun.

2891
02:01:07,820 --> 02:01:09,480
With my gunaxe.

2892
02:01:12,640 --> 02:01:13,840
That's fucking right.

2893
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:14,960
There you go.

2894
02:01:15,420 --> 02:01:17,160
I am playing the video game.

2895
02:01:18,840 --> 02:01:20,640
You die by gunaxe.

2896
02:01:22,640 --> 02:01:23,080
Nice.

2897
02:01:24,440 --> 02:01:27,120
I had to let go of my limiters for a second there.

2898
02:01:30,040 --> 02:01:30,480
Wait.

2899
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:31,200
I want the money.

2900
02:01:31,260 --> 02:01:31,420
No!

2901
02:01:31,780 --> 02:01:32,280
Oh, wait.

2902
02:01:32,280 --> 02:01:32,360
No.

2903
02:01:32,380 --> 02:01:32,560
That's it.

2904
02:01:32,560 --> 02:01:32,660
Those are just heals.

2905
02:01:32,940 --> 02:01:33,120
Okay.

2906
02:01:33,200 --> 02:01:33,620
Never mind.

2907
02:01:34,060 --> 02:01:35,060
Those are just heals.

2908
02:01:36,600 --> 02:01:37,200
Let's see.

2909
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:38,280
I want to make sure I got everything.

2910
02:01:39,340 --> 02:01:39,780
Alright.

2911
02:01:41,020 --> 02:01:41,780
Up I go.

2912
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:45,160
Oh.

2913
02:01:45,340 --> 02:01:46,240
There's somebody here.

2914
02:01:46,500 --> 02:01:46,980
Did you hear that?

2915
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:47,800
Yeah.

2916
02:01:48,020 --> 02:01:48,480
What is it?

2917
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:48,900
Who's there?

2918
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:49,540
We will see.

2919
02:01:50,500 --> 02:01:51,380
Stay close.

2920
02:01:51,940 --> 02:01:52,780
What is there?

2921
02:01:54,040 --> 02:01:54,480
Hello?

2922
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:56,080
Ma'am?

2923
02:01:59,490 --> 02:01:59,930
Hello?

2924
02:02:00,890 --> 02:02:01,710
Old lady?

2925
02:02:01,850 --> 02:02:02,110
Old lady?

2926
02:02:09,540 --> 02:02:09,980
Old lady?

2927
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:10,940
Where is that from?

2928
02:02:13,080 --> 02:02:15,280
I want to make sure I get rid of these guys first.

2929
02:02:18,930 --> 02:02:19,770
There you go.

2930
02:02:20,030 --> 02:02:21,350
Because I don't trust it.

2931
02:02:24,050 --> 02:02:26,970
That's how you grow up to be a man, boy.

2932
02:02:28,410 --> 02:02:30,830
We don't have any self-preservation here.

2933
02:02:31,190 --> 02:02:32,490
We go straight in.

2934
02:02:32,710 --> 02:02:32,910
Oh!

2935
02:02:38,580 --> 02:02:39,100
Okay.

2936
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:40,040
Okay.

2937
02:02:40,180 --> 02:02:40,700
Okay.

2938
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:41,320
Okay.

2939
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:41,440
Okay.

2940
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:42,220
Okay.

2941
02:02:42,220 --> 02:02:42,680
Okay.

2942
02:02:44,220 --> 02:02:44,740
Okay.

2943
02:02:44,760 --> 02:02:46,240
Alright, boy.

2944
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:48,960
Maybe we should have listened to our boy.

2945
02:02:49,820 --> 02:02:50,300
Alright.

2946
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:53,640
That's fine.

2947
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:55,840
That's fine.

2948
02:02:57,480 --> 02:02:58,200
It's fine.

2949
02:02:58,380 --> 02:02:58,740
It's fine.

2950
02:02:59,560 --> 02:03:00,360
There we go!

2951
02:03:00,660 --> 02:03:01,080
See?

2952
02:03:01,220 --> 02:03:01,860
We're so fine!

2953
02:03:02,300 --> 02:03:02,780
See?

2954
02:03:02,820 --> 02:03:03,540
We're so fine!

2955
02:03:04,680 --> 02:03:05,160
Easy.

2956
02:03:08,260 --> 02:03:08,740
Alright.

2957
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:09,400
Okay.

2958
02:03:09,480 --> 02:03:10,340
They're called revenants.

2959
02:03:10,360 --> 02:03:10,680
Alright.

2960
02:03:13,340 --> 02:03:13,820
Nice.

2961
02:03:13,940 --> 02:03:14,500
We did it.

2962
02:03:14,580 --> 02:03:14,740
We did it.

2963
02:03:14,760 --> 02:03:15,720
We're the kill leader.

2964
02:03:17,300 --> 02:03:17,780
Alright.

2965
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:24,620
Mother once told me that some witches trade little bits of their soul here to become more powerful in magic.

2966
02:03:24,820 --> 02:03:26,600
Eventually, they'll lose every part of their...

2967
02:03:26,600 --> 02:03:26,980
Oh, my God.

2968
02:03:27,040 --> 02:03:27,820
Look at their backs.

2969
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,880
That's a gamer posture right there.

2970
02:03:30,440 --> 02:03:36,320
They can disappear in an instant and these particular revenants are able to spread poison through touch and breath.

2971
02:03:36,860 --> 02:03:37,540
Oh, nice.

2972
02:03:38,900 --> 02:03:39,380
Alright.

2973
02:03:39,960 --> 02:03:41,340
They have a gamer back.

2974
02:03:41,640 --> 02:03:42,460
That's for sure.

2975
02:03:43,260 --> 02:03:44,280
It's a gamer.

2976
02:03:44,280 --> 02:03:44,680
It's a gamer.

2977
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:45,320
Yeah.

2978
02:03:46,280 --> 02:03:46,880
It's a gamer.

2979
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:47,400
Is that like...

2980
02:03:47,400 --> 02:03:48,420
Oh, that guy down.

2981
02:03:49,040 --> 02:03:49,800
Poor man.

2982
02:03:50,140 --> 02:03:51,240
Oh, I guess not.

2983
02:03:51,660 --> 02:03:52,180
Oh!

2984
02:03:52,260 --> 02:03:52,680
Nice.

2985
02:03:54,120 --> 02:03:54,840
Look at that.

2986
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:55,460
We're so...

2987
02:03:55,460 --> 02:03:56,280
We're so nice.

2988
02:03:57,400 --> 02:03:57,920
Wait.

2989
02:03:57,940 --> 02:03:58,360
Can I...

2990
02:03:58,360 --> 02:03:59,060
What is that?

2991
02:03:59,240 --> 02:04:00,440
There's like something over here.

2992
02:04:00,540 --> 02:04:02,900
There's like a grave over there for me to desecrate.

2993
02:04:03,380 --> 02:04:05,020
I love desecrating graves.

2994
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:05,600
Let's go!

2995
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:08,020
How the fuck?

2996
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:13,820
How did he jump on my back like that?

2997
02:04:15,460 --> 02:04:16,600
What the fuck, boy?

2998
02:04:17,920 --> 02:04:18,540
That's right.

2999
02:04:18,780 --> 02:04:20,400
He went coming alive on my watch.

3000
02:04:24,250 --> 02:04:24,730
Alright.

3001
02:04:25,230 --> 02:04:26,410
He's a fucking monkey.

3002
02:04:28,570 --> 02:04:29,050
Wait.

3003
02:04:29,090 --> 02:04:29,790
Can I break this?

3004
02:04:30,930 --> 02:04:31,410
No.

3005
02:04:31,670 --> 02:04:32,650
I see wood.

3006
02:04:32,750 --> 02:04:33,350
I want to break.

3007
02:04:33,750 --> 02:04:34,630
That's how it goes.

3008
02:04:37,230 --> 02:04:37,710
Okay.

3009
02:04:37,730 --> 02:04:39,250
I got to make sure these guys don't come alive.

3010
02:04:39,590 --> 02:04:40,510
I just don't...

3011
02:04:40,510 --> 02:04:40,850
Okay.

3012
02:04:40,950 --> 02:04:42,010
There's fall off.

3013
02:04:42,650 --> 02:04:43,610
Like, what?

3014
02:04:43,850 --> 02:04:44,270
Alright.

3015
02:04:44,610 --> 02:04:45,090
Okay.

3016
02:04:45,430 --> 02:04:45,910
Okay.

3017
02:04:45,930 --> 02:04:47,270
Are you...

3018
02:04:47,270 --> 02:04:49,990
How does there fall off?

3019
02:04:50,370 --> 02:04:51,710
Like, oh my...

3020
02:04:51,710 --> 02:04:52,890
I will get you!

3021
02:04:54,170 --> 02:04:54,890
Yes.

3022
02:04:55,030 --> 02:04:55,650
Bully.

3023
02:04:58,310 --> 02:04:59,030
Get out.

3024
02:05:02,630 --> 02:05:03,550
Get away.

3025
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:04,590
Get away.

3026
02:05:04,830 --> 02:05:05,510
Get away.

3027
02:05:05,790 --> 02:05:06,390
Get away.

3028
02:05:06,630 --> 02:05:07,230
Get away.

3029
02:05:07,430 --> 02:05:07,510
Get away.

3030
02:05:07,510 --> 02:05:08,610
That's fucking right.

3031
02:05:10,270 --> 02:05:13,090
I can't believe I threw the axe.

3032
02:05:13,290 --> 02:05:14,210
Holy shit.

3033
02:05:14,430 --> 02:05:14,950
I...

3034
02:05:14,950 --> 02:05:15,550
Okay.

3035
02:05:15,550 --> 02:05:15,910
Okay.

3036
02:05:18,670 --> 02:05:20,930
I didn't even melee him.

3037
02:05:20,950 --> 02:05:22,430
I just fucking threw it.

3038
02:05:22,490 --> 02:05:22,870
I...

3039
02:05:23,670 --> 02:05:24,390
Okay.

3040
02:05:24,690 --> 02:05:24,930
Nice.

3041
02:05:25,210 --> 02:05:25,510
Alright.

3042
02:05:30,950 --> 02:05:31,670
Alright.

3043
02:05:31,950 --> 02:05:32,330
Nice.

3044
02:05:33,490 --> 02:05:34,110
Oh...

3045
02:05:34,110 --> 02:05:35,670
I fucking knew it.

3046
02:05:35,890 --> 02:05:37,090
I knew it!

3047
02:05:40,750 --> 02:05:41,470
Alright.

3048
02:05:41,970 --> 02:05:44,730
That's the only thing you can do.

3049
02:05:44,730 --> 02:05:44,910
Yeah.

3050
02:05:45,190 --> 02:05:45,910
Oh god.

3051
02:05:45,910 --> 02:05:49,190
Bro, that guy's aim is just as worse as yours.

3052
02:05:50,030 --> 02:05:51,230
All right, come on.

3053
02:05:51,310 --> 02:05:51,950
Get over here.

3054
02:05:52,070 --> 02:05:53,490
You can't dodge this forever!

3055
02:05:54,550 --> 02:05:55,650
That's fucking right!

3056
02:05:56,170 --> 02:05:57,250
Shoot him in the head!

3057
02:05:59,250 --> 02:06:00,230
Shoot him in the head!

3058
02:06:00,390 --> 02:06:01,510
Oh my god, he blocked me!

3059
02:06:01,750 --> 02:06:02,090
Bro!

3060
02:06:02,590 --> 02:06:04,050
I'm trying to get this other guy!

3061
02:06:04,550 --> 02:06:05,950
Okay, now I can use the heavy.

3062
02:06:06,510 --> 02:06:07,970
All right, get out of here.

3063
02:06:10,070 --> 02:06:10,710
Get out.

3064
02:06:10,710 --> 02:06:11,410
You're level one.

3065
02:06:11,490 --> 02:06:12,410
You're a little baby.

3066
02:06:12,730 --> 02:06:14,030
What are you doing in here?

3067
02:06:15,070 --> 02:06:16,930
Oh, wait, you're a little baby.

3068
02:06:18,650 --> 02:06:19,850
All right, last guy.

3069
02:06:22,750 --> 02:06:23,310
Nice.

3070
02:06:25,190 --> 02:06:27,310
That's right, you can't get close to us.

3071
02:06:27,930 --> 02:06:28,570
That's right!

3072
02:06:31,110 --> 02:06:31,670
Easy.

3073
02:06:31,670 --> 02:06:33,510
All right, there should be some loot here.

3074
02:06:34,650 --> 02:06:35,790
I love loot.

3075
02:06:36,210 --> 02:06:37,490
Wait, I can charge it?

3076
02:06:38,890 --> 02:06:39,970
No, I can't.

3077
02:06:39,970 --> 02:06:40,390
You lied.

3078
02:06:40,390 --> 02:06:40,650
You lied.

3079
02:06:42,670 --> 02:06:44,610
I thought I could charge it.

3080
02:06:44,630 --> 02:06:46,030
You guys made me so excited.

3081
02:06:47,270 --> 02:06:49,390
I could have abused this even more.

3082
02:06:52,110 --> 02:06:52,530
Unlimited.

3083
02:06:52,710 --> 02:06:53,370
Yeah, I was gonna say.

3084
02:06:54,150 --> 02:06:54,850
Wait, I can?

3085
02:06:56,090 --> 02:06:56,510
How?

3086
02:06:58,010 --> 02:06:59,050
Am I charging it?

3087
02:06:59,590 --> 02:07:00,810
Oh, it's an upgrade.

3088
02:07:01,110 --> 02:07:03,230
Okay, you guys know why I'm gonna upgrade first.

3089
02:07:03,650 --> 02:07:04,070
Yes.

3090
02:07:09,410 --> 02:07:10,310
That's gonna be the...

3091
02:07:10,390 --> 02:07:11,270
Read, boy!

3092
02:07:14,710 --> 02:07:16,190
Read, I'm illiterate!

3093
02:07:17,990 --> 02:07:20,150
I learned to fight not to read.

3094
02:07:22,030 --> 02:07:23,950
That's why I banged your mother.

3095
02:07:24,290 --> 02:07:25,770
She was my reader.

3096
02:07:26,010 --> 02:07:29,270
And now you're gonna be my new reader.

3097
02:07:32,170 --> 02:07:33,050
All right, let's see.

3098
02:07:34,010 --> 02:07:35,590
I needed a guide.

3099
02:07:36,310 --> 02:07:38,410
All right, boy, it's time to read again.

3100
02:07:40,390 --> 02:07:40,470
Another.

3101
02:07:41,630 --> 02:07:42,130
Read.

3102
02:07:42,710 --> 02:07:43,510
He says his name is...

3103
02:07:44,090 --> 02:07:44,510
Hrungnir.

3104
02:07:44,910 --> 02:07:46,290
Mother told me about him.

3105
02:07:46,410 --> 02:07:47,370
A giant warrior.

3106
02:07:47,450 --> 02:07:49,310
Did my fists do the talking?

3107
02:07:51,610 --> 02:07:52,290
Odin's there?

3108
02:07:52,650 --> 02:07:53,150
Thor?

3109
02:07:53,350 --> 02:07:54,470
Where's the World Serpent again?

3110
02:07:54,750 --> 02:07:54,990
The ground serpent.

3111
02:07:55,250 --> 02:07:55,750
What about Loki?

3112
02:07:57,210 --> 02:07:59,210
Is Loki hot in this version too?

3113
02:07:59,770 --> 02:08:00,190
See?

3114
02:08:00,990 --> 02:08:01,690
But look.

3115
02:08:02,590 --> 02:08:03,890
Hrungnir's body squished him.

3116
02:08:05,650 --> 02:08:06,150
Idiot.

3117
02:08:07,810 --> 02:08:09,430
Oh, we found more of the shrines.

3118
02:08:12,170 --> 02:08:12,770
Hrungnir.

3119
02:08:12,770 --> 02:08:12,890
All right.

3120
02:08:13,850 --> 02:08:14,670
Let's go.

3121
02:08:15,410 --> 02:08:18,130
I wonder if Loki is hot in this one too.

3122
02:08:20,390 --> 02:08:22,710
There's always a hot Loki.

3123
02:08:23,930 --> 02:08:26,030
He's a god of mischief for a reason.

3124
02:08:27,430 --> 02:08:28,170
All right.

3125
02:08:29,130 --> 02:08:29,750
Let's see.

3126
02:08:30,190 --> 02:08:31,110
Where do I go?

3127
02:08:32,290 --> 02:08:32,750
Oh, here.

3128
02:08:32,950 --> 02:08:34,670
I can't believe I already got lost.

3129
02:08:35,130 --> 02:08:35,730
Yeah.

3130
02:08:37,050 --> 02:08:37,650
Fire.

3131
02:08:39,110 --> 02:08:40,190
Let there be fire.

3132
02:08:43,330 --> 02:08:43,970
Okay.

3133
02:08:44,390 --> 02:08:45,030
Alright.

3134
02:08:46,450 --> 02:08:47,090
Phew!

3135
02:08:47,290 --> 02:08:50,310
Okay, one... where's the second one?

3136
02:08:50,610 --> 02:08:51,930
Are they all here?

3137
02:08:53,290 --> 02:08:57,250
Are they all in the same room or are they further away?

3138
02:08:58,730 --> 02:09:00,010
Let's see...

3139
02:09:00,010 --> 02:09:02,490
Where are the other ones?

3140
02:09:05,030 --> 02:09:06,910
Where would the other ones be?

3141
02:09:10,190 --> 02:09:11,170
Where's the other...

3142
02:09:11,710 --> 02:09:13,270
Oh, it's the same room?

3143
02:09:16,070 --> 02:09:18,410
Uh... they're usually close by.

3144
02:09:18,710 --> 02:09:18,930
Okay.

3145
02:09:19,090 --> 02:09:20,530
Oh, I found... is that one of them?

3146
02:09:22,050 --> 02:09:22,870
Is that one?

3147
02:09:24,150 --> 02:09:27,230
Okay, there's falloff, so...

3148
02:09:31,050 --> 02:09:32,050
Holy shit!

3149
02:09:32,090 --> 02:09:33,710
Okay, that's the last one.

3150
02:09:33,910 --> 02:09:34,830
Alright, nice.

3151
02:09:39,130 --> 02:09:39,650
Nice.

3152
02:09:39,650 --> 02:09:40,230
Gun of war.

3153
02:09:46,960 --> 02:09:48,000
Nice, I got another.

3154
02:09:48,140 --> 02:09:48,820
I need one more apple.

3155
02:09:50,380 --> 02:09:51,540
Gamer of the year.

3156
02:09:54,840 --> 02:09:55,360
Jump.

3157
02:09:56,540 --> 02:09:57,060
Alright.

3158
02:09:57,740 --> 02:09:58,640
Oh, chest!

3159
02:09:59,220 --> 02:10:00,000
Loot time!

3160
02:10:00,860 --> 02:10:01,380
Loot.

3161
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:05,180
I wonder if I go... can I go this way?

3162
02:10:05,360 --> 02:10:05,780
No.

3163
02:10:06,320 --> 02:10:07,640
Can I jump this way?

3164
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:08,360
No.

3165
02:10:08,360 --> 02:10:10,360
But there's, like, something over there.

3166
02:10:10,660 --> 02:10:13,360
I don't know if, like, I'll be heading there soon.

3167
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:15,680
So... let's see.

3168
02:10:16,720 --> 02:10:18,380
I will be, eventually.

3169
02:10:18,760 --> 02:10:21,440
I have to get up there soon, so...

3170
02:10:21,440 --> 02:10:22,300
Oh, no.

3171
02:10:22,360 --> 02:10:24,200
Wait, can I... are these the guys I can... no.

3172
02:10:24,360 --> 02:10:25,080
God damn it.

3173
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:27,020
God, get over here.

3174
02:10:28,600 --> 02:10:29,040
Okay.

3175
02:10:30,620 --> 02:10:31,060
Oh!

3176
02:10:31,900 --> 02:10:32,640
Oh, shit.

3177
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:34,360
Punch.

3178
02:10:35,620 --> 02:10:37,260
Alright, get over here!

3179
02:10:38,360 --> 02:10:39,100
Get over here!

3180
02:10:39,160 --> 02:10:39,680
That's right!

3181
02:10:40,200 --> 02:10:43,220
How dare you be immune to my axe!

3182
02:10:43,680 --> 02:10:44,500
I think you got him.

3183
02:10:44,780 --> 02:10:45,220
Nice.

3184
02:10:46,460 --> 02:10:47,140
Oh, shit.

3185
02:10:47,300 --> 02:10:48,000
Alright, time.

3186
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:50,960
Alright, use my boy's arrows on you.

3187
02:10:51,880 --> 02:10:52,540
That's right.

3188
02:10:55,060 --> 02:10:55,500
Oh!

3189
02:10:55,500 --> 02:10:56,420
There's more than one!

3190
02:10:57,500 --> 02:10:58,460
It's alright, boy!

3191
02:10:58,780 --> 02:10:59,420
Distract him!

3192
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:02,180
Distra... Oh, shit!

3193
02:11:02,240 --> 02:11:03,020
That hits me?

3194
02:11:05,060 --> 02:11:05,900
That's right, boy!

3195
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:07,560
Just take as much damage as you can!

3196
02:11:09,160 --> 02:11:09,900
Oh, shit.

3197
02:11:10,180 --> 02:11:11,080
Oh, shit.

3198
02:11:12,280 --> 02:11:13,060
It's okay!

3199
02:11:13,160 --> 02:11:14,540
Take as much damage!

3200
02:11:15,020 --> 02:11:16,700
You have infinite HP!

3201
02:11:18,120 --> 02:11:19,180
It'll be fine!

3202
02:11:19,380 --> 02:11:20,580
You're so healthy!

3203
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:22,920
You're so healthy!

3204
02:11:24,940 --> 02:11:25,660
Jesus, Chris.

3205
02:11:25,740 --> 02:11:27,060
I need to do the heavy attack on you.

3206
02:11:28,160 --> 02:11:28,680
Alright.

3207
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:29,500
Aggro him!

3208
02:11:29,580 --> 02:11:30,300
Aggro him, boy!

3209
02:11:31,100 --> 02:11:31,800
Aggro him!

3210
02:11:33,900 --> 02:11:35,920
So I can abuse my axe!

3211
02:11:39,700 --> 02:11:40,300
Alright.

3212
02:11:40,380 --> 02:11:41,080
Oh, shit.

3213
02:11:42,360 --> 02:11:42,960
Okay.

3214
02:11:43,220 --> 02:11:43,820
No!

3215
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:45,980
He's so fucking...

3216
02:11:45,980 --> 02:11:47,080
Spaz!

3217
02:11:50,040 --> 02:11:50,640
Alright.

3218
02:11:50,940 --> 02:11:54,140
We're gonna make sure we can...

3219
02:11:54,140 --> 02:11:55,620
Jesus, they're all range!

3220
02:11:56,080 --> 02:11:57,400
They're all range!

3221
02:11:57,620 --> 02:11:59,060
Bro, what the fuck?

3222
02:12:00,460 --> 02:12:03,740
Why did you not dodge my son's arrows?

3223
02:12:03,740 --> 02:12:08,600
You dodged my axe, but not my son's arrows?

3224
02:12:09,580 --> 02:12:10,540
That's fucked!

3225
02:12:10,940 --> 02:12:11,240
Okay.

3226
02:12:11,380 --> 02:12:12,000
There we go.

3227
02:12:13,420 --> 02:12:14,080
There we go.

3228
02:12:14,460 --> 02:12:14,940
Nice.

3229
02:12:15,220 --> 02:12:15,720
You know what?

3230
02:12:15,960 --> 02:12:16,720
No, fuck you.

3231
02:12:19,120 --> 02:12:19,800
Fuck you!

3232
02:12:19,900 --> 02:12:20,440
Fuck you!

3233
02:12:20,560 --> 02:12:21,280
Fuck you!

3234
02:12:21,420 --> 02:12:22,000
Fuck you!

3235
02:12:23,440 --> 02:12:23,920
Nice.

3236
02:12:25,220 --> 02:12:25,440
Alright.

3237
02:12:27,080 --> 02:12:27,560
Alright.

3238
02:12:29,640 --> 02:12:30,440
Oh, shit.

3239
02:12:30,820 --> 02:12:32,080
I don't think I needed that.

3240
02:12:33,220 --> 02:12:34,980
Arrow is faster.

3241
02:12:37,860 --> 02:12:38,940
What is that thing?

3242
02:12:39,080 --> 02:12:39,300
Okay.

3243
02:12:39,480 --> 02:12:43,740
If these things do manage to freeze us, we should stay on the defensive until it passes.

3244
02:12:44,420 --> 02:12:44,940
Alright.

3245
02:12:45,080 --> 02:12:45,360
Nice.

3246
02:12:46,180 --> 02:12:48,360
Never get close to me again, bitch.

3247
02:12:52,500 --> 02:12:53,540
Follow me.

3248
02:12:54,240 --> 02:12:54,760
Alright.

3249
02:12:56,500 --> 02:12:58,140
Hope she learns her lesson.

3250
02:13:00,400 --> 02:13:00,920
Uh...

3251
02:13:00,920 --> 02:13:01,640
Never time.

3252
02:13:04,340 --> 02:13:05,040
Alright, boy.

3253
02:13:05,260 --> 02:13:06,360
Get on the other side.

3254
02:13:06,780 --> 02:13:08,120
Get on the other side for dead!

3255
02:13:10,920 --> 02:13:11,920
Is there like...

3256
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:14,120
Where's the thing I'm supposed to... Is it here?

3257
02:13:17,140 --> 02:13:17,660
What?

3258
02:13:20,300 --> 02:13:22,740
It's like here, but like how do I...

3259
02:13:23,680 --> 02:13:24,200
What?

3260
02:13:29,010 --> 02:13:29,530
Oh.

3261
02:13:30,450 --> 02:13:30,970
Oh!

3262
02:13:32,310 --> 02:13:33,710
God, I'm so... Okay.

3263
02:13:35,130 --> 02:13:35,690
Stop.

3264
02:13:36,370 --> 02:13:36,930
Okay.

3265
02:13:39,830 --> 02:13:40,390
Alright.

3266
02:13:41,090 --> 02:13:41,650
Stop.

3267
02:13:42,090 --> 02:13:43,050
There we go.

3268
02:13:44,010 --> 02:13:45,230
I didn't see that.

3269
02:13:45,350 --> 02:13:46,090
That's cool.

3270
02:13:46,410 --> 02:13:47,270
I like that.

3271
02:13:48,350 --> 02:13:49,170
Look at that.

3272
02:13:49,270 --> 02:13:49,510
See?

3273
02:13:49,710 --> 02:13:51,310
I can use my brain sometimes.

3274
02:13:53,510 --> 02:13:54,070
Guys?

3275
02:13:55,050 --> 02:13:55,610
Guys!

3276
02:13:55,710 --> 02:13:56,670
I told you guys!

3277
02:13:57,490 --> 02:14:00,550
There's still some connectivity going down there.

3278
02:14:00,710 --> 02:14:02,230
The synapses are still firing.

3279
02:14:06,310 --> 02:14:07,350
They're still firing!

3280
02:14:09,210 --> 02:14:09,730
Alright.

3281
02:14:09,850 --> 02:14:11,670
Let's see if I can get my axe back.

3282
02:14:14,310 --> 02:14:14,830
Alright.

3283
02:14:15,630 --> 02:14:16,610
Open the chest.

3284
02:14:17,190 --> 02:14:18,350
What does it reveal?

3285
02:14:20,670 --> 02:14:21,190
Alright.

3286
02:14:21,270 --> 02:14:21,590
Nice.

3287
02:14:22,150 --> 02:14:23,370
Oh, I got some steel.

3288
02:14:23,430 --> 02:14:25,110
I guess those are for my axe upgrades.

3289
02:14:26,190 --> 02:14:26,890
What's that?

3290
02:14:27,290 --> 02:14:28,370
Oh, more coins.

3291
02:14:29,530 --> 02:14:30,790
Am I slowly walking?

3292
02:14:31,070 --> 02:14:31,950
All these dead.

3293
02:14:32,010 --> 02:14:32,210
Oh.

3294
02:14:32,210 --> 02:14:33,530
You think it's safe in there?

3295
02:14:33,630 --> 02:14:35,230
You think it's safer out here?

3296
02:14:35,610 --> 02:14:36,690
It's always safe.

3297
02:14:37,050 --> 02:14:39,170
It'll be safe when I kill everybody.

3298
02:14:40,650 --> 02:14:41,970
Get over there, boy.

3299
02:14:42,410 --> 02:14:42,630
What's that smell?

3300
02:14:43,890 --> 02:14:45,130
It's called bodies.

3301
02:14:45,570 --> 02:14:47,250
That's why we burned up your mother.

3302
02:14:48,310 --> 02:14:49,550
Are they Hellwalkers?

3303
02:14:50,010 --> 02:14:50,570
Wait.

3304
02:14:50,710 --> 02:14:51,550
Peep humans?

3305
02:14:52,730 --> 02:14:54,390
Someone start the fires!

3306
02:14:54,610 --> 02:14:55,690
Sigmund, you're nice.

3307
02:14:56,110 --> 02:14:58,290
So many days without meat.

3308
02:14:58,750 --> 02:14:59,310
Peepa?

3309
02:14:59,710 --> 02:15:00,270
Wait.

3310
02:15:00,270 --> 02:15:00,510
Us?

3311
02:15:00,930 --> 02:15:01,790
Behind me.

3312
02:15:01,850 --> 02:15:02,190
Oh, yeah.

3313
02:15:02,210 --> 02:15:02,950
What are cannibals?

3314
02:15:07,090 --> 02:15:09,730
What the fuck?

3315
02:15:13,150 --> 02:15:14,270
That's fucking right.

3316
02:15:14,630 --> 02:15:16,530
Oh, you guys are Peepa.

3317
02:15:17,570 --> 02:15:19,190
You guys are Peepa.

3318
02:15:19,390 --> 02:15:20,150
You guys...

3319
02:15:20,150 --> 02:15:21,650
You guys are weak.

3320
02:15:23,870 --> 02:15:25,630
Oh, that's cute.

3321
02:15:26,770 --> 02:15:27,890
That's cute.

3322
02:15:28,070 --> 02:15:28,390
Oh!

3323
02:15:30,590 --> 02:15:31,190
Wait.

3324
02:15:31,250 --> 02:15:31,710
Who are you?

3325
02:15:33,070 --> 02:15:34,270
That's not Peepa.

3326
02:15:35,270 --> 02:15:36,630
That's dead fuck guys.

3327
02:15:37,390 --> 02:15:38,310
Who are you?

3328
02:15:40,330 --> 02:15:41,810
Where the fuck are you?

3329
02:15:42,690 --> 02:15:44,210
Bro, you're behind a fucking...

3330
02:15:44,210 --> 02:15:44,470
Wow!

3331
02:15:51,260 --> 02:15:52,460
Oh, shit!

3332
02:15:54,820 --> 02:15:56,080
Oh, shit!

3333
02:15:56,380 --> 02:15:57,680
You sick shaked him.

3334
02:15:58,720 --> 02:16:00,540
You got your first human kill.

3335
02:16:00,680 --> 02:16:01,660
How do you feel, boy?

3336
02:16:02,380 --> 02:16:03,580
How do you feel?

3337
02:16:04,200 --> 02:16:05,280
You feel good?

3338
02:16:05,440 --> 02:16:06,040
You feel good?

3339
02:16:06,860 --> 02:16:08,100
You feel good, boy?

3340
02:16:08,640 --> 02:16:09,180
Don't worry.

3341
02:16:09,260 --> 02:16:10,920
I'll chop him up for you so you can get up.

3342
02:16:11,800 --> 02:16:14,180
I like how you cannot aim at him anymore.

3343
02:16:15,400 --> 02:16:15,800
Wait.

3344
02:16:17,700 --> 02:16:19,700
Does it work if I go further away?

3345
02:16:26,720 --> 02:16:28,060
Boy, how does it feel?

3346
02:16:28,180 --> 02:16:30,160
You got your first kill, boy!

3347
02:16:31,220 --> 02:16:32,380
Does it feel good?

3348
02:16:34,720 --> 02:16:35,480
Oh, I thought...

3349
02:16:35,480 --> 02:16:37,100
I was like, wouldn't it be funny if I could just climb?

3350
02:16:37,140 --> 02:16:37,600
Oh, I thought...

3351
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:39,080
Climb away.

3352
02:16:40,120 --> 02:16:40,700
All right.

3353
02:16:40,740 --> 02:16:42,000
I got to make sure I got the loot.

3354
02:16:42,200 --> 02:16:42,580
Oh, boy.

3355
02:16:42,660 --> 02:16:44,260
I got some money for us.

3356
02:16:45,880 --> 02:16:46,320
Nice.

3357
02:16:46,640 --> 02:16:47,320
All right.

3358
02:16:47,400 --> 02:16:47,820
All right.

3359
02:16:47,820 --> 02:16:48,580
I'll come back now.

3360
02:16:51,660 --> 02:16:55,160
You like living with the consequences of your actions?

3361
02:16:55,360 --> 02:16:55,980
Don't worry.

3362
02:16:56,020 --> 02:16:56,540
I got you.

3363
02:16:58,360 --> 02:17:00,020
Baby's first human kill.

3364
02:17:01,160 --> 02:17:01,600
Congratulations.

3365
02:17:08,220 --> 02:17:08,880
Don't worry.

3366
02:17:08,960 --> 02:17:10,660
Your skin will start absorbing the blood.

3367
02:17:10,880 --> 02:17:12,520
The moment I put this man's egg in his mouth.

3368
02:17:12,540 --> 02:17:13,500
You're going to have ashes on your body.

3369
02:17:18,530 --> 02:17:21,270
They made a sequel, so you're going to be killing a lot more.

3370
02:17:35,980 --> 02:17:37,020
Oh, shit!

3371
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:40,600
You're a man now, boy.

3372
02:17:41,180 --> 02:17:41,700
Man.

3373
02:17:42,360 --> 02:17:43,180
Man-boy.

3374
02:17:44,620 --> 02:17:48,460
It's time to close your heart because we're about to kill some more fools.

3375
02:17:48,920 --> 02:17:49,800
Oh, wait.

3376
02:17:49,940 --> 02:17:50,200
What?

3377
02:17:51,500 --> 02:17:52,300
They're regenerating.

3378
02:17:53,580 --> 02:17:54,840
I will handle this.

3379
02:17:55,680 --> 02:17:57,620
Oh, they're the ghost guys.

3380
02:18:00,380 --> 02:18:02,100
They're the guys that I can't...

3381
02:18:02,100 --> 02:18:02,640
Wait.

3382
02:18:02,720 --> 02:18:03,160
I got to make sure.

3383
02:18:05,300 --> 02:18:05,700
No.

3384
02:18:05,740 --> 02:18:05,860
Yeah.

3385
02:18:05,880 --> 02:18:06,020
No.

3386
02:18:06,080 --> 02:18:06,640
I can't do this.

3387
02:18:06,780 --> 02:18:07,280
I can't.

3388
02:18:07,740 --> 02:18:08,320
That's good.

3389
02:18:08,540 --> 02:18:09,580
That's all I need to know.

3390
02:18:10,380 --> 02:18:10,960
Oh, shit.

3391
02:18:10,980 --> 02:18:11,600
Except for you.

3392
02:18:12,060 --> 02:18:12,800
That's all right.

3393
02:18:12,860 --> 02:18:14,380
I don't need it.

3394
02:18:15,320 --> 02:18:15,720
Just...

3395
02:18:15,720 --> 02:18:16,080
Whoa!

3396
02:18:16,440 --> 02:18:16,840
No.

3397
02:18:16,940 --> 02:18:17,540
You get this.

3398
02:18:17,720 --> 02:18:18,060
Okay.

3399
02:18:18,100 --> 02:18:18,260
Wait.

3400
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:19,800
Give me a sec.

3401
02:18:19,880 --> 02:18:20,180
Oh, shit.

3402
02:18:20,200 --> 02:18:21,340
Give me a sec.

3403
02:18:21,520 --> 02:18:22,700
You get this, though.

3404
02:18:23,080 --> 02:18:26,440
You get this and then I'll beat the shit out of him.

3405
02:18:28,740 --> 02:18:29,520
That's right!

3406
02:18:29,660 --> 02:18:30,720
Get over here!

3407
02:18:30,980 --> 02:18:32,220
Get over here!

3408
02:18:33,420 --> 02:18:34,380
With you.

3409
02:18:37,200 --> 02:18:38,180
Get down!

3410
02:18:39,720 --> 02:18:40,460
All right.

3411
02:18:41,660 --> 02:18:42,260
Loot.

3412
02:18:43,800 --> 02:18:44,400
Loot.

3413
02:18:44,680 --> 02:18:45,820
They came back.

3414
02:18:46,300 --> 02:18:47,680
Yeah, they regenerated.

3415
02:18:51,940 --> 02:18:53,000
Except for that guy.

3416
02:18:54,520 --> 02:18:55,740
Oh, cause he was dead then.

3417
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,680
Okay, we gotta figure out how to get out of here, man-boy.

3418
02:19:02,080 --> 02:19:03,100
Escape the ruins.

3419
02:19:03,420 --> 02:19:04,220
I assume it's here.

3420
02:19:04,600 --> 02:19:05,680
Oh wait, is that...

3421
02:19:05,680 --> 02:19:06,800
I thought it was here.

3422
02:19:07,900 --> 02:19:08,480
What's this?

3423
02:19:14,840 --> 02:19:16,040
What is this?

3424
02:19:16,040 --> 02:19:16,040
Boy.

3425
02:19:16,560 --> 02:19:18,060
Manboy, did you not hear me?

3426
02:19:18,520 --> 02:19:19,840
Go drop the chain.

3427
02:19:22,120 --> 02:19:25,240
You had to learn how to kill sooner or later.

3428
02:19:26,360 --> 02:19:27,780
And it's now soon.

3429
02:19:31,880 --> 02:19:33,580
Manboy, don't be so depressed!

3430
02:19:35,700 --> 02:19:37,600
We killed so many before!

3431
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:39,560
Oh, he's sad.

3432
02:19:41,160 --> 02:19:42,460
He's sad, sad.

3433
02:19:44,080 --> 02:19:45,060
Alright, come on!

3434
02:19:45,540 --> 02:19:45,840
Arteus!

3435
02:19:47,060 --> 02:19:49,040
Oh, that's when you know Dad's serious.

3436
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:50,420
He called him by his first name.

3437
02:19:52,580 --> 02:19:53,780
Oh, Arteus!

3438
02:19:54,400 --> 02:19:55,000
Manboy!

3439
02:19:57,160 --> 02:19:58,420
Close your heart!

3440
02:20:00,460 --> 02:20:01,060
Yeah!

3441
02:20:03,520 --> 02:20:05,080
It was self-defense!

3442
02:20:05,880 --> 02:20:06,940
It was reflex!

3443
02:20:08,220 --> 02:20:09,960
And we will go home, boy.

3444
02:20:10,400 --> 02:20:10,920
What?

3445
02:20:11,140 --> 02:20:12,660
To give up this easily.

3446
02:20:13,380 --> 02:20:15,240
So close to the start.

3447
02:20:15,620 --> 02:20:16,240
Wait, no!

3448
02:20:16,720 --> 02:20:17,800
I'm not giving up!

3449
02:20:17,860 --> 02:20:18,580
I can do this!

3450
02:20:18,800 --> 02:20:19,900
I just have to...

3451
02:20:19,900 --> 02:20:21,020
Ah, manipulation.

3452
02:20:23,160 --> 02:20:24,160
Good parenting.

3453
02:20:28,740 --> 02:20:31,040
Maybe you were just too weak!

3454
02:20:32,440 --> 02:20:33,840
Damn, Kratos!

3455
02:20:35,260 --> 02:20:35,780
Damn!

3456
02:20:36,260 --> 02:20:37,220
That's fucked!

3457
02:20:40,640 --> 02:20:42,000
Holy shit!

3458
02:20:42,200 --> 02:20:45,000
Maybe you're just a fucking weak boy!

3459
02:20:48,260 --> 02:20:49,620
Jesus Christ!

3460
02:20:49,700 --> 02:20:52,300
This boy literally just killed his first man!

3461
02:20:52,760 --> 02:20:54,240
He's like, alright, we'll turn around!

3462
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:56,260
We'll just turn around!

3463
02:20:57,140 --> 02:20:58,340
That's what you want?

3464
02:21:00,740 --> 02:21:02,180
Aren't you the product of it?

3465
02:21:03,380 --> 02:21:07,920
Look, my father and his father was raised like this.

3466
02:21:07,920 --> 02:21:10,040
And I will continue this circle.

3467
02:21:16,900 --> 02:21:19,180
Alright, we're path to the mountains.

3468
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:23,900
Oh, there's a chest here.

3469
02:21:27,260 --> 02:21:29,240
Don't make me turn this car around, boy!

3470
02:21:31,240 --> 02:21:34,060
Okay, there's something down here, so I'm gonna go check it.

3471
02:21:34,520 --> 02:21:35,120
Real quick.

3472
02:21:39,380 --> 02:21:41,480
Wait, which way am I supposed to go?

3473
02:21:41,580 --> 02:21:42,680
Am I supposed to go this way?

3474
02:21:47,840 --> 02:21:48,300
What?

3475
02:21:49,460 --> 02:21:52,480
Am I supposed to go this way or the other way?

3476
02:21:54,100 --> 02:21:54,780
Let's see.

3477
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:57,600
I'm gonna go this way first and then double check.

3478
02:21:59,900 --> 02:22:03,540
Okay, my boy is going that way, so definitely not that way.

3479
02:22:05,120 --> 02:22:05,820
Wait, no.

3480
02:22:06,600 --> 02:22:08,560
No, he actually went the right way?

3481
02:22:09,560 --> 02:22:10,640
I'm so confused.

3482
02:22:11,140 --> 02:22:13,240
No, this has to be the right way because there's a bridge.

3483
02:22:13,920 --> 02:22:14,400
Okay.

3484
02:22:15,260 --> 02:22:16,320
I'm gonna go down then.

3485
02:22:17,620 --> 02:22:18,600
Yeah, I'm gonna go down.

3486
02:22:19,100 --> 02:22:20,300
Because like there's a bridge.

3487
02:22:20,600 --> 02:22:23,260
So that means like this is the not the right way.

3488
02:22:23,900 --> 02:22:25,540
This is the loot way.

3489
02:22:25,940 --> 02:22:26,380
Oh!

3490
02:22:26,760 --> 02:22:27,240
Yoink!

3491
02:22:28,080 --> 02:22:28,800
Mine now.

3492
02:22:29,800 --> 02:22:30,640
Found a mask.

3493
02:22:32,500 --> 02:22:33,540
That means XP.

3494
02:22:34,720 --> 02:22:35,540
The boy...

3495
02:22:35,540 --> 02:22:38,220
Yeah, the boy like walked away so he knows.

3496
02:22:39,100 --> 02:22:40,500
How do I get down though?

3497
02:22:41,940 --> 02:22:43,020
I wanna get down.

3498
02:22:43,720 --> 02:22:44,440
Is that it?

3499
02:22:44,560 --> 02:22:45,800
Was that the only loot?

3500
02:22:48,580 --> 02:22:49,580
Oh, I guess it was.

3501
02:22:49,740 --> 02:22:50,640
Oh no, I've been here!

3502
02:22:53,560 --> 02:22:54,500
What's that sound?

3503
02:22:54,580 --> 02:22:55,320
Is that a fairy?

3504
02:22:56,860 --> 02:22:57,800
Alright, up I go.

3505
02:22:58,600 --> 02:22:59,620
Up I go.

3506
02:23:03,860 --> 02:23:04,260
Okay.

3507
02:23:05,440 --> 02:23:05,840
Hello.

3508
02:23:06,020 --> 02:23:06,700
Oh, it's a crow!

3509
02:23:08,460 --> 02:23:09,180
Hello there!

3510
02:23:16,950 --> 02:23:17,350
Yay!

3511
02:23:17,830 --> 02:23:18,590
Oh, it's the owl!

3512
02:23:18,610 --> 02:23:19,510
It's the eyes of Odin!

3513
02:23:20,510 --> 02:23:21,510
I knew it.

3514
02:23:21,650 --> 02:23:22,770
I knew it!

3515
02:23:22,890 --> 02:23:25,830
The birds were spies all along from the government!

3516
02:23:26,350 --> 02:23:27,950
The government is Odin!

3517
02:23:30,330 --> 02:23:32,490
I fucking knew birds were unreal!

3518
02:23:32,990 --> 02:23:34,470
I fucking knew it!

3519
02:23:37,250 --> 02:23:38,810
I knew it.

3520
02:23:44,440 --> 02:23:46,300
Oh, don't slap him!

3521
02:23:46,980 --> 02:23:48,040
That's fucked!

3522
02:23:48,200 --> 02:23:49,240
Can't get this slow.

3523
02:23:49,280 --> 02:23:51,300
I'd cock hump to cross the bridge.

3524
02:23:53,240 --> 02:23:54,080
That's so fucked!

3525
02:23:54,400 --> 02:23:55,220
There's something in the trees over there.

3526
02:23:55,420 --> 02:23:56,400
There's what now?

3527
02:24:00,890 --> 02:24:03,850
Father, throw your axe at those trees on the other side of the bridge.

3528
02:24:04,270 --> 02:24:05,670
The ones with the white shrubs.

3529
02:24:07,830 --> 02:24:08,470
Oh, okay.

3530
02:24:11,370 --> 02:24:11,810
Wait.

3531
02:24:12,630 --> 02:24:14,030
Am I supposed to just throw it?

3532
02:24:14,150 --> 02:24:14,930
Just this once.

3533
02:24:15,510 --> 02:24:16,390
Which trees?

3534
02:24:17,650 --> 02:24:18,090
Oh!

3535
02:24:20,910 --> 02:24:21,790
These trees!

3536
02:24:22,390 --> 02:24:23,090
These trees!

3537
02:24:24,550 --> 02:24:25,050
These trees!

3538
02:24:25,050 --> 02:24:26,110
What?

3539
02:24:26,510 --> 02:24:27,610
What is that?

3540
02:24:34,590 --> 02:24:36,650
Yeah, he looks- he takes it after me.

3541
02:24:44,290 --> 02:24:46,050
Um, I don't see color.

3542
02:25:05,660 --> 02:25:07,460
That axe you got there.

3543
02:25:08,300 --> 02:25:09,980
It was me what made her.

3544
02:25:10,560 --> 02:25:11,860
Me and my brother.

3545
02:25:12,400 --> 02:25:13,860
Was one of our best.

3546
02:25:14,180 --> 02:25:15,280
Oh, it's your axe?

3547
02:25:15,560 --> 02:25:17,660
Nobody else go work on her except for us two.

3548
02:25:18,320 --> 02:25:18,800
Oh!

3549
02:25:19,920 --> 02:25:21,640
You gotta handle her special.

3550
02:25:22,120 --> 02:25:23,920
Or she'll wreck beyond fixing.

3551
02:25:25,720 --> 02:25:29,780
I can enhance her for you right now if it so pleases you, son of a bitch.

3552
02:25:31,900 --> 02:25:33,100
So what say you?

3553
02:25:33,820 --> 02:25:34,300
God!

3554
02:25:34,300 --> 02:25:36,080
Damn, no slapper!

3555
02:25:36,380 --> 02:25:37,060
I do not believe you.

3556
02:25:37,200 --> 02:25:38,160
Oh, slap him.

3557
02:25:38,620 --> 02:25:38,740
Come, boy.

3558
02:25:40,860 --> 02:25:43,820
There's a rune in the shape of a fork under the grip.

3559
02:25:46,380 --> 02:25:48,780
No digger be yadimba.

3560
02:25:49,080 --> 02:25:55,460
That was our brand, my brother and me, before we split.

3561
02:25:55,700 --> 02:25:57,360
I got half of it right here.

3562
02:25:57,460 --> 02:25:57,660
See?

3563
02:26:00,800 --> 02:26:03,000
Look, you want I should upgrade her or not?

3564
02:26:03,340 --> 02:26:03,800
Yes.

3565
02:26:03,920 --> 02:26:04,280
Upgrade.

3566
02:26:04,300 --> 02:26:05,480
I want to charge my axe.

3567
02:26:06,400 --> 02:26:07,800
I expect an improvement.

3568
02:26:12,470 --> 02:26:13,850
Where did I get this axe?

3569
02:26:14,170 --> 02:26:15,090
Was it from my wife?

3570
02:26:16,070 --> 02:26:17,910
So, where's the other half of the brand?

3571
02:26:18,490 --> 02:26:20,650
All my dumb brothers got it.

3572
02:26:20,730 --> 02:26:22,450
But I got all the talent.

3573
02:26:22,770 --> 02:26:23,170
Look!

3574
02:26:23,590 --> 02:26:24,450
Where did he...

3575
02:26:24,450 --> 02:26:25,770
When did he set up this tent?

3576
02:26:25,990 --> 02:26:27,290
So what did you find out?

3577
02:26:27,690 --> 02:26:28,190
Okay.

3578
02:26:29,310 --> 02:26:31,310
Welcome to the Dwarthen shop.

3579
02:26:31,490 --> 02:26:34,310
From here you can upgrade equipment you already own.

3580
02:26:34,430 --> 02:26:36,470
Or craft entirely new weapons.

3581
02:26:36,470 --> 02:26:40,250
Brock has given you a frozen flame, a rare resource.

3582
02:26:40,670 --> 02:26:44,690
Resources found in the world can be used to craft and upgrade your...

3583
02:26:44,690 --> 02:26:45,370
Okay.

3584
02:26:47,510 --> 02:26:48,290
Dwarthen magic.

3585
02:26:48,510 --> 02:26:48,810
True.

3586
02:26:49,090 --> 02:26:49,550
True.

3587
02:26:50,310 --> 02:26:52,530
Just like my blood absorption magic.

3588
02:26:53,410 --> 02:26:55,430
Kratos equipment has power level and stats.

3589
02:26:55,510 --> 02:26:59,010
Upgrading the axe levels up to strength, which contributes to Kratos power.

3590
02:26:59,850 --> 02:27:02,090
Kratos power level and stats are displayed here.

3591
02:27:04,590 --> 02:27:05,150
Okay.

3592
02:27:05,830 --> 02:27:06,390
Renekton.

3593
02:27:06,470 --> 02:27:09,070
Damage can be increased by increasing runic.

3594
02:27:09,470 --> 02:27:12,710
Runic attack cooldowns can be reduced by increasing cooldown.

3595
02:27:13,210 --> 02:27:14,830
Each stat has gameplay benefits.

3596
02:27:17,250 --> 02:27:18,970
Press L to hide the description.

3597
02:27:20,710 --> 02:27:25,630
Power level and stats gain will be displayed on the item card and also reflects the Kratos stat table.

3598
02:27:26,470 --> 02:27:28,710
Updating a weapon permanently increases these stats.

3599
02:27:28,870 --> 02:27:31,410
Other items must be equipped to influence Kratos' stat.

3600
02:27:33,090 --> 02:27:34,210
Resources required...

3601
02:27:34,210 --> 02:27:34,710
Upgrade...

3602
02:27:34,710 --> 02:27:34,790
Upgrade...

3603
02:27:35,620 --> 02:27:38,770
Resources required to upgrade are displayed at the bottom of the item card.

3604
02:27:39,130 --> 02:27:40,090
Hold to upgrade.

3605
02:27:40,430 --> 02:27:40,930
Okay.

3606
02:27:41,950 --> 02:27:42,530
Nice.

3607
02:27:42,990 --> 02:27:45,110
New skills are now available on the skill tab.

3608
02:27:45,850 --> 02:27:46,430
Yay!

3609
02:27:47,490 --> 02:27:49,450
The axe is now level 2.

3610
02:27:50,990 --> 02:27:54,290
Upgrading your weapon unlocks new skills for purchase.

3611
02:27:54,530 --> 02:27:56,730
Visit the skill tab to purchase them.

3612
02:27:57,490 --> 02:27:58,070
Okay.

3613
02:27:59,670 --> 02:28:01,530
Oh, I can craft armor.

3614
02:28:02,530 --> 02:28:03,950
Which armor should I craft?

3615
02:28:05,050 --> 02:28:06,650
Oh, you don't need armor.

3616
02:28:06,750 --> 02:28:08,330
You don't even take damage.

3617
02:28:08,470 --> 02:28:09,490
You don't die.

3618
02:28:10,150 --> 02:28:11,990
It's me who needs armor.

3619
02:28:12,370 --> 02:28:12,950
Okay.

3620
02:28:13,010 --> 02:28:13,970
I have a lot.

3621
02:28:14,680 --> 02:28:15,910
All right.

3622
02:28:15,950 --> 02:28:16,470
We're going to...

3623
02:28:16,470 --> 02:28:16,670
Ooh.

3624
02:28:16,790 --> 02:28:20,030
Do I want to cover my fucking body though?

3625
02:28:22,130 --> 02:28:23,130
It's just...

3626
02:28:23,130 --> 02:28:24,290
Do I need it?

3627
02:28:24,470 --> 02:28:25,010
Ooh.

3628
02:28:25,090 --> 02:28:25,890
But then like...

3629
02:28:25,890 --> 02:28:26,090
Okay.

3630
02:28:26,130 --> 02:28:27,590
I want the plus 7 there.

3631
02:28:27,790 --> 02:28:28,770
The tunic.

3632
02:28:29,730 --> 02:28:30,310
Nice.

3633
02:28:32,290 --> 02:28:32,870
Nice.

3634
02:28:32,870 --> 02:28:33,350
Nice.

3635
02:28:33,350 --> 02:28:34,190
Okay.

3636
02:28:35,150 --> 02:28:36,610
Do I need...

3637
02:28:37,670 --> 02:28:38,630
Strength is good.

3638
02:28:38,710 --> 02:28:39,610
Do I need defense?

3639
02:28:41,170 --> 02:28:41,730
Nah.

3640
02:28:42,090 --> 02:28:43,430
I won't put a shirt on.

3641
02:28:44,370 --> 02:28:47,730
I will refuse to put a shirt on.

3642
02:28:48,790 --> 02:28:49,910
I refuse.

3643
02:28:52,550 --> 02:28:53,110
Okay.

3644
02:28:54,350 --> 02:28:55,250
I'm going to get that then.

3645
02:28:55,970 --> 02:28:56,530
Talon.

3646
02:28:56,570 --> 02:28:57,050
You don't...

3647
02:28:57,050 --> 02:28:58,470
We don't need you to upgrade.

3648
02:28:58,830 --> 02:28:59,230
All right.

3649
02:28:59,290 --> 02:28:59,750
Let's see.

3650
02:29:00,530 --> 02:29:01,510
All right.

3651
02:29:01,590 --> 02:29:01,970
Nice.

3652
02:29:02,590 --> 02:29:03,150
Okay.

3653
02:29:03,150 --> 02:29:03,330
Okay.

3654
02:29:03,350 --> 02:29:03,830
We're going...

3655
02:29:03,830 --> 02:29:04,990
Might last a day.

3656
02:29:06,210 --> 02:29:06,710
Okay.

3657
02:29:06,810 --> 02:29:07,490
We're going to get that.

3658
02:29:07,990 --> 02:29:09,010
And then...

3659
02:29:09,590 --> 02:29:11,410
We don't need to upgrade this for now.

3660
02:29:11,570 --> 02:29:14,630
Well, I'll talk now, but our friends who were hiding in the trees are back for more.

3661
02:29:14,930 --> 02:29:15,810
Go on.

3662
02:29:15,890 --> 02:29:17,930
Let these girls free...

3663
02:29:17,930 --> 02:29:19,450
Free the nipple.

3664
02:29:23,470 --> 02:29:24,830
Free the nipple.

3665
02:29:29,050 --> 02:29:29,550
Yes!

3666
02:29:31,870 --> 02:29:33,330
What the fuck are you doing?

3667
02:29:33,350 --> 02:29:33,670
Please!

3668
02:29:33,670 --> 02:29:35,270
This is exactly why!

3669
02:29:35,630 --> 02:29:46,670
This is exactly why I did not... I did not fucking give him armor and upgrades.

3670
02:29:47,150 --> 02:29:48,290
Or bow upgrades.

3671
02:29:48,710 --> 02:29:50,110
He doesn't even help!

3672
02:29:51,490 --> 02:29:55,330
Oh, now you're not gonna help, boy!

3673
02:29:59,130 --> 02:30:01,010
That's fucked!

3674
02:30:01,510 --> 02:30:04,070
That's actually fucked!

3675
02:30:04,590 --> 02:30:06,110
There we go.

3676
02:30:06,410 --> 02:30:11,070
Nice, we're fine.

3677
02:30:11,730 --> 02:30:13,630
Didn't I equip it?

3678
02:30:17,010 --> 02:30:18,250
Alright.

3679
02:30:21,950 --> 02:30:23,470
Let's see.

3680
02:30:25,130 --> 02:30:26,770
We did not equip it?

3681
02:30:26,830 --> 02:30:27,550
I thought I did!

3682
02:30:27,850 --> 02:30:29,210
I crafted it!

3683
02:30:30,790 --> 02:30:32,470
No, he doesn't need anything.

3684
02:30:34,770 --> 02:30:35,690
I did not!

3685
02:30:37,510 --> 02:30:38,510
How do I equip?

3686
02:30:39,490 --> 02:30:40,610
Okay, armor.

3687
02:30:43,430 --> 02:30:43,990
Okay.

3688
02:30:45,270 --> 02:30:45,830
Enchantments.

3689
02:30:46,010 --> 02:30:46,870
Do I have?

3690
02:30:48,510 --> 02:30:50,130
Some artists have enchantments.

3691
02:30:50,150 --> 02:30:50,450
Select.

3692
02:30:50,750 --> 02:30:51,210
Oh!

3693
02:30:52,370 --> 02:30:53,250
I don't.

3694
02:30:53,470 --> 02:30:54,170
Oh!

3695
02:30:55,370 --> 02:30:55,970
Defense!

3696
02:30:56,430 --> 02:30:56,830
Yeah!

3697
02:31:01,420 --> 02:31:02,020
Luck.

3698
02:31:02,060 --> 02:31:03,340
Who the fuck needs luck?

3699
02:31:03,460 --> 02:31:04,480
What does luck do?

3700
02:31:06,820 --> 02:31:07,960
Oh, it increases gains.

3701
02:31:08,740 --> 02:31:09,920
No, we don't need that.

3702
02:31:12,240 --> 02:31:13,360
Okay, armor.

3703
02:31:15,860 --> 02:31:17,380
Okay, we need that.

3704
02:31:18,320 --> 02:31:20,700
And then... get that in.

3705
02:31:21,900 --> 02:31:23,060
Luck of Ages?

3706
02:31:24,340 --> 02:31:24,940
No.

3707
02:31:24,940 --> 02:31:25,140
Nope.

3708
02:31:25,760 --> 02:31:26,180
Alright.

3709
02:31:26,740 --> 02:31:27,880
Doki, you need it.

3710
02:31:28,220 --> 02:31:29,080
But like...

3711
02:31:29,080 --> 02:31:30,480
But the strength!

3712
02:31:31,560 --> 02:31:34,720
But it's minus six in strength though!

3713
02:31:35,600 --> 02:31:36,440
Like...

3714
02:31:36,440 --> 02:31:37,580
But it's...

3715
02:31:40,640 --> 02:31:43,380
But it's minus six in strength!

3716
02:31:45,960 --> 02:31:49,500
But what about my gains, chat?

3717
02:31:49,820 --> 02:31:52,060
What about my gains?

3718
02:31:52,900 --> 02:31:53,380
I need to run.

3719
02:31:54,820 --> 02:31:56,380
That's the end of the game!

3720
02:31:59,540 --> 02:32:00,280
Okay, wait.

3721
02:32:00,380 --> 02:32:01,260
I need to...

3722
02:32:03,200 --> 02:32:03,680
Strength.

3723
02:32:04,080 --> 02:32:04,560
Cool...

3724
02:32:04,560 --> 02:32:05,880
Do I have any?

3725
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:06,940
Nope, I do not.

3726
02:32:07,100 --> 02:32:07,920
Do I have anything for this?

3727
02:32:08,120 --> 02:32:08,300
Oh!

3728
02:32:10,320 --> 02:32:11,660
Oh, it's just like...

3729
02:32:11,660 --> 02:32:12,780
different colors.

3730
02:32:12,900 --> 02:32:13,720
That doesn't even matter.

3731
02:32:15,720 --> 02:32:16,620
Defender of the...

3732
02:32:16,620 --> 02:32:17,440
I feel like...

3733
02:32:17,840 --> 02:32:19,640
Oh, the Black Shield looks cool.

3734
02:32:20,660 --> 02:32:21,620
Buckler and...

3735
02:32:21,620 --> 02:32:23,060
Okay, I'm gonna get the black one.

3736
02:32:23,580 --> 02:32:25,000
This one looks sick.

3737
02:32:25,300 --> 02:32:26,880
Uh, and then the bow.

3738
02:32:28,200 --> 02:32:29,680
Whatever, we don't care about you.

3739
02:32:32,100 --> 02:32:33,460
Alright, let's see.

3740
02:32:33,840 --> 02:32:34,320
Skills.

3741
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:35,180
Okay, skills.

3742
02:32:36,900 --> 02:32:37,720
Range combat!

3743
02:32:40,500 --> 02:32:41,800
Alright, let's see.

3744
02:32:41,980 --> 02:32:46,900
I have enough for... Do I have enough?

3745
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:47,380
I do.

3746
02:32:50,690 --> 02:32:52,310
Oh shit, I wanna charge!

3747
02:32:55,110 --> 02:32:55,590
Nice.

3748
02:32:55,870 --> 02:32:56,710
Charge axe.

3749
02:32:56,950 --> 02:32:57,670
Alright, there you go.

3750
02:32:58,310 --> 02:33:00,010
That's all the upgrades I need.

3751
02:33:02,210 --> 02:33:03,170
Close combat?

3752
02:33:03,330 --> 02:33:04,190
The fuck is that?

3753
02:33:06,790 --> 02:33:08,090
Oh, can I talk to you?

3754
02:33:11,870 --> 02:33:12,350
Damn,

3755
02:33:20,750 --> 02:33:21,790
he went corp bro!

3756
02:33:23,090 --> 02:33:24,590
50-50 down the middle.

3757
02:33:25,290 --> 02:33:28,170
Guess that was the last thing we saw eye to eye on.

3758
02:33:28,430 --> 02:33:30,750
Oh my god, his brother went corp bro and he stayed indie.

3759
02:33:30,990 --> 02:33:31,490
You wanna hug?

3760
02:33:32,010 --> 02:33:33,090
Hit the road!

3761
02:33:34,070 --> 02:33:34,550
Sorry.

3762
02:33:35,750 --> 02:33:36,230
Damn.

3763
02:33:36,710 --> 02:33:39,150
He was like, I ain't no fucking bootlicker.

3764
02:33:39,830 --> 02:33:42,390
I'm gonna fuck... That's... Damn!

3765
02:33:44,470 --> 02:33:46,710
Can't believe he would do that to him!

3766
02:33:47,410 --> 02:33:47,890
Hahaha!

3767
02:33:47,890 --> 02:33:47,970
Hahaha!

3768
02:33:51,390 --> 02:33:52,610
Alright, let's see.

3769
02:33:53,270 --> 02:33:55,450
I wanna make sure there's nothing here.

3770
02:33:56,050 --> 02:33:57,030
Is there anything here?

3771
02:34:01,330 --> 02:34:03,230
Alright, I don't know if this is the right way.

3772
02:34:03,430 --> 02:34:04,730
Or like, the...

3773
02:34:05,770 --> 02:34:06,210
Uh...

3774
02:34:06,210 --> 02:34:07,590
Alright, here you go.

3775
02:34:09,950 --> 02:34:11,550
Oh yeah, this is not the right way.

3776
02:34:11,590 --> 02:34:12,450
This is the...

3777
02:34:12,450 --> 02:34:13,630
Bonus area!

3778
02:34:14,630 --> 02:34:15,350
Bonus area!

3779
02:34:15,350 --> 02:34:15,370
Bonus area!

3780
02:34:17,610 --> 02:34:19,250
It's called Tough Love.

3781
02:34:20,110 --> 02:34:23,750
He went to work at like, uh, Swarovski or some shit.

3782
02:34:24,810 --> 02:34:26,270
I don't fucking know that.

3783
02:34:26,310 --> 02:34:26,730
That's jewelry.

3784
02:34:26,990 --> 02:34:30,090
I don't know any fucking corporate metal makers.

3785
02:34:36,370 --> 02:34:40,810
I was thinking of jewelry and I was like, Swarovski.

3786
02:34:42,290 --> 02:34:43,750
It was nice meeting you, Brock.

3787
02:34:44,290 --> 02:34:45,930
I'll be thinking you have a name for your beast.

3788
02:34:46,210 --> 02:34:48,450
How about I name her fucking Gratitude?

3789
02:34:48,770 --> 02:34:49,010
Whoa!

3790
02:34:49,990 --> 02:34:51,970
Fucking Gratitude, come over here!

3791
02:34:52,910 --> 02:34:53,390
Damn!

3792
02:34:55,430 --> 02:34:56,390
Alright, let's go.

3793
02:35:01,270 --> 02:35:01,750
Alright.

3794
02:35:02,430 --> 02:35:04,090
Time to put my ox in.

3795
02:35:04,810 --> 02:35:05,290
Nice.

3796
02:35:05,390 --> 02:35:06,850
Hey, watch your hinds in there!

3797
02:35:09,180 --> 02:35:09,680
Real good!

3798
02:35:09,740 --> 02:35:10,640
Wait, how do you know?

3799
02:35:10,680 --> 02:35:11,480
You been here before?

3800
02:35:13,120 --> 02:35:14,400
How do you know that?

3801
02:35:15,480 --> 02:35:17,760
Oh, so I have to go... I have to go back.

3802
02:35:17,760 --> 02:35:20,020
Cause like, there's like a little door here.

3803
02:35:20,200 --> 02:35:21,600
I missed a bridge loot?

3804
02:35:32,400 --> 02:35:34,060
Oh, there you are.

3805
02:35:36,280 --> 02:35:37,220
There you are.

3806
02:35:37,380 --> 02:35:38,380
No crows.

3807
02:35:39,120 --> 02:35:40,320
That's fucking right.

3808
02:35:40,400 --> 02:35:41,460
Oh, there's a bridge loot!

3809
02:35:42,960 --> 02:35:44,900
You thought you could hide from me?

3810
02:35:45,340 --> 02:35:46,200
I knew it.

3811
02:35:46,240 --> 02:35:47,280
All birds are spies.

3812
02:35:47,760 --> 02:35:48,420
From the government.

3813
02:35:48,960 --> 02:35:50,300
They're the mini drones.

3814
02:35:50,440 --> 02:35:52,380
Those are the drones you gotta worry about!

3815
02:35:54,300 --> 02:35:55,520
Alright, let's see.

3816
02:35:56,940 --> 02:35:57,920
We gotta...

3817
02:35:58,640 --> 02:35:59,640
Okay, that's fine.

3818
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:00,800
Let's go back.

3819
02:36:03,980 --> 02:36:04,540
Alright.

3820
02:36:04,840 --> 02:36:06,180
Give me my axe.

3821
02:36:07,520 --> 02:36:08,080
Nice.

3822
02:36:10,060 --> 02:36:10,620
Alright.

3823
02:36:14,510 --> 02:36:15,270
Let's go.

3824
02:36:15,870 --> 02:36:18,170
Let's go to where all the dead bodies are.

3825
02:36:18,170 --> 02:36:19,890
Cause that's always a good sign.

3826
02:36:21,550 --> 02:36:22,890
Get my axe back.

3827
02:36:23,250 --> 02:36:23,850
Oooh.

3828
02:36:26,010 --> 02:36:26,630
Woah!

3829
02:36:27,430 --> 02:36:28,610
Boy, you liar.

3830
02:36:31,290 --> 02:36:32,690
You fucking liar.

3831
02:36:33,950 --> 02:36:35,930
I trusted you, boy.

3832
02:36:36,310 --> 02:36:38,190
I fucking trusted you.

3833
02:36:38,290 --> 02:36:39,530
You said we could go there.

3834
02:36:39,590 --> 02:36:40,810
I fucking went up there.

3835
02:36:41,210 --> 02:36:43,370
This way.

3836
02:36:45,590 --> 02:36:47,250
You said we could go!

3837
02:36:47,250 --> 02:36:49,470
Of course I fucking ran up!

3838
02:36:53,150 --> 02:36:55,290
Of course I trusted him!

3839
02:36:57,290 --> 02:36:58,190
I didn't...

3840
02:36:58,190 --> 02:37:00,250
I didn't know he meant, like, I gotta wait.

3841
02:37:00,790 --> 02:37:01,950
I didn't know that.

3842
02:37:05,610 --> 02:37:06,130
Wait.

3843
02:37:06,350 --> 02:37:07,790
How do I get that?

3844
02:37:09,510 --> 02:37:10,910
There's, like, a whole...

3845
02:37:10,910 --> 02:37:11,310
Oh, wait.

3846
02:37:12,170 --> 02:37:12,690
Oh.

3847
02:37:12,930 --> 02:37:13,450
Oh.

3848
02:37:16,230 --> 02:37:17,010
There's a...

3849
02:37:17,010 --> 02:37:17,230
There's a...

3850
02:37:17,230 --> 02:37:18,230
There's a hole here.

3851
02:37:20,750 --> 02:37:21,450
Yay.

3852
02:37:28,830 --> 02:37:30,650
Oh, I see.

3853
02:37:31,070 --> 02:37:32,370
I see.

3854
02:37:33,630 --> 02:37:34,330
Okay.

3855
02:37:34,450 --> 02:37:37,210
I'm gonna make sure it's maxed out.

3856
02:37:44,990 --> 02:37:46,390
Okay, give me a sec.

3857
02:37:47,930 --> 02:37:49,110
Give me a sec.

3858
02:37:50,690 --> 02:37:51,910
Give me a sec.

3859
02:37:53,850 --> 02:37:55,450
Give me a sec.

3860
02:37:55,750 --> 02:37:56,670
Don't... Okay.

3861
02:37:58,850 --> 02:38:00,110
Is our boy okay?

3862
02:38:01,350 --> 02:38:01,910
They...

3863
02:38:01,910 --> 02:38:02,970
Are they dead?

3864
02:38:05,130 --> 02:38:06,070
I did it.

3865
02:38:06,830 --> 02:38:08,090
Is our boy okay?

3866
02:38:08,330 --> 02:38:09,150
Where's our boy?

3867
02:38:09,530 --> 02:38:10,510
Where did he go?

3868
02:38:11,250 --> 02:38:11,670
Where did...

3869
02:38:14,050 --> 02:38:15,770
Where did our boy go?

3870
02:38:19,950 --> 02:38:21,210
Did he die?

3871
02:38:22,910 --> 02:38:24,350
Like, is he okay?

3872
02:38:26,790 --> 02:38:27,510
Alright, cool.

3873
02:38:28,150 --> 02:38:28,910
We did it.

3874
02:38:28,990 --> 02:38:30,070
Wait, how do I get over here, though?

3875
02:38:30,710 --> 02:38:32,130
How do I get over on that side?

3876
02:38:32,210 --> 02:38:32,710
Where did he go?

3877
02:38:36,500 --> 02:38:36,900
Oh!

3878
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:37,560
He's alive!

3879
02:38:39,160 --> 02:38:39,560
Wait.

3880
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:40,680
Where is he?

3881
02:38:41,500 --> 02:38:42,500
I hear him.

3882
02:38:44,060 --> 02:38:45,380
I hear him, though.

3883
02:38:48,580 --> 02:38:49,780
How do I get on top?

3884
02:38:49,940 --> 02:38:51,960
Oh, I think that was, like, the people I crushed.

3885
02:38:52,860 --> 02:38:53,680
I'm pretty sure.

3886
02:38:54,060 --> 02:38:54,460
Alright.

3887
02:38:57,640 --> 02:38:58,860
Where did he come from?

3888
02:38:59,160 --> 02:38:59,560
Wait.

3889
02:39:00,520 --> 02:39:02,960
Where did he come from?

3890
02:39:03,400 --> 02:39:04,540
How did he get here?

3891
02:39:08,400 --> 02:39:10,480
Never been this close to the mountain before.

3892
02:39:11,800 --> 02:39:12,680
Looks so big.

3893
02:39:15,940 --> 02:39:17,660
I cast Summon Boy!

3894
02:39:25,290 --> 02:39:27,310
No, don't show affection, Kratos.

3895
02:39:27,410 --> 02:39:28,090
You're not weak.

3896
02:39:29,550 --> 02:39:30,030
Don't...

3897
02:39:32,250 --> 02:39:37,250
My father never gave me a hug, so you will never get a hug.

3898
02:39:41,430 --> 02:39:42,690
Oh, apparently I missed loot.

3899
02:39:44,970 --> 02:39:45,650
How do I...

3900
02:39:45,650 --> 02:39:46,470
How do I get it?

3901
02:39:47,050 --> 02:39:48,790
Like, I don't even know how to get across.

3902
02:39:49,630 --> 02:39:50,370
Oh, I jump.

3903
02:39:50,510 --> 02:39:50,790
Okay.

3904
02:39:54,110 --> 02:39:55,990
I figured it out.

3905
02:39:56,230 --> 02:39:56,690
Okay.

3906
02:39:56,710 --> 02:39:58,790
There is...

3907
02:40:00,790 --> 02:40:01,990
Oh shit!

3908
02:40:03,190 --> 02:40:03,790
Sorry!

3909
02:40:05,310 --> 02:40:06,670
I missed the hole.

3910
02:40:08,910 --> 02:40:09,510
Alright.

3911
02:40:09,590 --> 02:40:10,330
One of it.

3912
02:40:12,290 --> 02:40:12,890
Alright.

3913
02:40:12,970 --> 02:40:13,310
Boom.

3914
02:40:14,910 --> 02:40:15,510
Guys.

3915
02:40:17,270 --> 02:40:18,730
I missed the hole.

3916
02:40:19,950 --> 02:40:21,550
Oh, I can do this again!

3917
02:40:22,930 --> 02:40:23,530
Oh!

3918
02:40:23,530 --> 02:40:24,370
That's neat!

3919
02:40:26,070 --> 02:40:26,670
Oh!

3920
02:40:26,670 --> 02:40:28,810
I can do this all over again!

3921
02:40:29,710 --> 02:40:30,550
That's fun!

3922
02:40:34,470 --> 02:40:35,610
That's so fun!

3923
02:40:36,890 --> 02:40:38,650
Well, now that I know...

3924
02:40:40,010 --> 02:40:41,870
Oh, because I... wait...

3925
02:40:42,510 --> 02:40:43,670
Oh, but there's loot!

3926
02:40:45,410 --> 02:40:46,010
Yay!

3927
02:40:49,030 --> 02:40:50,450
Okay, we go back.

3928
02:40:51,490 --> 02:40:52,690
I want to get the loot!

3929
02:40:52,990 --> 02:40:54,230
I want to get the loot!

3930
02:40:54,410 --> 02:40:55,530
I want to get the loot!

3931
02:40:58,210 --> 02:41:00,030
Wait, can I do that from here too?

3932
02:41:00,290 --> 02:41:00,950
Oh, I can!

3933
02:41:03,770 --> 02:41:04,250
Oh!

3934
02:41:04,830 --> 02:41:05,690
That's neat!

3935
02:41:07,250 --> 02:41:12,280
That's what I was supposed to do!

3936
02:41:19,040 --> 02:41:23,040
That's what I was supposed to do during that fight!

3937
02:41:24,700 --> 02:41:25,340
Oh!

3938
02:41:25,340 --> 02:41:27,640
That makes a lot more sense now!

3939
02:41:28,840 --> 02:41:30,300
Hey, but it worked!

3940
02:41:31,060 --> 02:41:32,440
Guys, it worked!

3941
02:41:35,500 --> 02:41:36,900
Better late than never!

3942
02:41:37,240 --> 02:41:38,320
That's what they say!

3943
02:41:39,100 --> 02:41:40,780
Better late than never!

3944
02:41:41,400 --> 02:41:43,660
At least I learned now!

3945
02:41:47,840 --> 02:41:49,440
Next time I'm here!

3946
02:41:50,340 --> 02:41:52,120
It was speedrunning, exactly!

3947
02:41:53,560 --> 02:41:54,520
Where is...

3948
02:41:55,740 --> 02:41:56,960
If it works, it works!

3949
02:41:57,080 --> 02:41:57,220
Yeah!

3950
02:41:57,460 --> 02:41:59,740
But where is, like, the other...

3951
02:42:01,240 --> 02:42:02,900
That guy particularly... Oh, wait!

3952
02:42:03,160 --> 02:42:03,640
Yay!

3953
02:42:06,560 --> 02:42:08,160
I did it the Doki way!

3954
02:42:08,280 --> 02:42:10,300
I wanted to show you the Doki way first!

3955
02:42:10,900 --> 02:42:12,360
And, like, it killed!

3956
02:42:12,660 --> 02:42:13,760
It killed all of them!

3957
02:42:13,900 --> 02:42:14,380
Guys!

3958
02:42:15,480 --> 02:42:17,400
It killed all of them as well!

3959
02:42:18,080 --> 02:42:18,940
So fast!

3960
02:42:19,360 --> 02:42:20,820
Like, I see it here!

3961
02:42:21,420 --> 02:42:22,240
But, like...

3962
02:42:22,240 --> 02:42:25,420
How do I get to that side to, like...

3963
02:42:26,200 --> 02:42:27,160
Throw my a...

3964
02:42:27,160 --> 02:42:28,320
I see... Is that... Is that it?

3965
02:42:29,840 --> 02:42:30,860
Like, it is!

3966
02:42:32,780 --> 02:42:34,360
Like, but how do I get it...

3967
02:42:34,360 --> 02:42:35,240
Get that?

3968
02:42:37,600 --> 02:42:38,060
Huh...

3969
02:42:39,140 --> 02:42:39,880
Oh, there's that!

3970
02:42:41,820 --> 02:42:43,220
Oh, I raised it... Ow!

3971
02:42:46,180 --> 02:42:47,580
Can I raise it from here?

3972
02:42:47,720 --> 02:42:48,180
Oh!

3973
02:42:48,180 --> 02:42:48,540
Oh!

3974
02:42:50,980 --> 02:42:52,680
I can be higher!

3975
02:42:53,940 --> 02:42:54,420
Oh!

3976
02:42:55,260 --> 02:42:56,240
Can I get crushed?

3977
02:42:56,620 --> 02:42:57,060
No.

3978
02:43:02,230 --> 02:43:03,930
Okay, but, like, how high can this go?

3979
02:43:06,390 --> 02:43:07,650
How high can this go?

3980
02:43:08,770 --> 02:43:09,970
Is there anything here?

3981
02:43:11,150 --> 02:43:11,910
I'm learning!

3982
02:43:13,830 --> 02:43:15,050
No, there's nothing here.

3983
02:43:15,450 --> 02:43:16,530
It was just for that.

3984
02:43:17,390 --> 02:43:18,650
My brain is growing.

3985
02:43:19,010 --> 02:43:20,430
The synapses are snapping.

3986
02:43:21,190 --> 02:43:23,090
The neurons are snapping right now.

3987
02:43:26,170 --> 02:43:27,550
Alright, we can open the chest.

3988
02:43:27,750 --> 02:43:28,770
We're gonna get a heart!

3989
02:43:31,310 --> 02:43:31,710
Finally!

3990
02:43:31,970 --> 02:43:33,150
We got the transplant!

3991
02:43:33,310 --> 02:43:34,090
We're on the list!

3992
02:43:37,210 --> 02:43:37,610
Nice.

3993
02:43:38,750 --> 02:43:39,770
Now we have more HP.

3994
02:43:40,810 --> 02:43:41,530
Oh, wait, what?

3995
02:43:41,650 --> 02:43:42,190
This is different.

3996
02:43:42,310 --> 02:43:43,470
Now I can have maximum rage.

3997
02:43:44,370 --> 02:43:47,070
Blood meat is a rare drink that makes one's rage run deeper.

3998
02:43:47,250 --> 02:43:48,090
Find the nine horns.

3999
02:43:48,190 --> 02:43:48,930
But I wanted a heart!

4000
02:43:50,250 --> 02:43:50,970
I wanted a heart!

4001
02:43:50,970 --> 02:43:52,670
So I can actually feel something.

4002
02:43:54,130 --> 02:43:55,430
Guys, that was a joke.

4003
02:43:55,530 --> 02:43:56,790
I can feel.

4004
02:43:57,510 --> 02:43:58,610
I need to reiterate.

4005
02:43:58,770 --> 02:43:59,570
That was a joke.

4006
02:44:03,800 --> 02:44:05,000
Alright, let's see.

4007
02:44:06,540 --> 02:44:07,460
Is that reading?

4008
02:44:09,060 --> 02:44:10,300
No, that's not reading.

4009
02:44:11,340 --> 02:44:11,880
Alright.

4010
02:44:12,280 --> 02:44:13,360
Oh, there's loot!

4011
02:44:13,920 --> 02:44:14,600
Give me.

4012
02:44:16,950 --> 02:44:17,820
Found more masks!

4013
02:44:20,580 --> 02:44:21,500
Let's see.

4014
02:44:23,780 --> 02:44:24,820
What is it?

4015
02:44:24,840 --> 02:44:25,640
Oh, it's a shrine.

4016
02:44:27,080 --> 02:44:28,100
Let's go up to it.

4017
02:44:28,240 --> 02:44:29,260
The room's written along the side.

4018
02:44:30,880 --> 02:44:31,280
Read.

4019
02:44:31,400 --> 02:44:31,980
What does it say?

4020
02:44:32,380 --> 02:44:35,360
As we are, we two, we three.

4021
02:44:36,260 --> 02:44:36,880
It's beautiful.

4022
02:44:37,480 --> 02:44:37,960
Because I know it can never be.

4023
02:44:38,180 --> 02:44:38,840
A riddle.

4024
02:44:40,600 --> 02:44:41,940
Maybe there's a clue around here.

4025
02:44:41,940 --> 02:44:42,660
Wait, can you repeat it?

4026
02:44:42,720 --> 02:44:43,240
I wasn't listening.

4027
02:44:43,780 --> 02:44:44,180
Wait.

4028
02:44:44,260 --> 02:44:44,860
What did he say?

4029
02:44:45,180 --> 02:44:45,580
Wait.

4030
02:44:46,220 --> 02:44:46,620
Wait.

4031
02:44:46,700 --> 02:44:48,160
Is there a way to repeat the riddle?

4032
02:44:48,840 --> 02:44:49,620
Guys, what?

4033
02:44:49,880 --> 02:44:50,660
What did he...

4034
02:44:53,240 --> 02:44:54,960
I wasn't paying attention.

4035
02:44:55,100 --> 02:44:56,980
Seems like maybe those rings should be turning.

4036
02:44:57,400 --> 02:44:58,120
Oh, okay.

4037
02:44:59,240 --> 02:45:00,280
How do we do that?

4038
02:45:02,100 --> 02:45:03,040
How do we...

4039
02:45:03,040 --> 02:45:04,800
How do we do that?

4040
02:45:05,080 --> 02:45:06,140
Oh, there, there, there.

4041
02:45:09,060 --> 02:45:09,820
Is that it?

4042
02:45:12,380 --> 02:45:13,600
Clearly, it's something.

4043
02:45:13,800 --> 02:45:14,960
We have to turn this somehow.

4044
02:45:15,800 --> 02:45:17,000
How do we turn it?

4045
02:45:20,110 --> 02:45:22,050
Is that a button on his chest?

4046
02:45:22,350 --> 02:45:23,490
How do we turn it?

4047
02:45:28,680 --> 02:45:29,360
How do we turn it?

4048
02:45:29,360 --> 02:45:31,240
I use my brain.

4049
02:45:34,360 --> 02:45:36,400
We're not going to escape before they succeed.

4050
02:45:36,400 --> 02:45:36,420
I played like a fool.

4051
02:45:41,420 --> 02:45:42,460
There's a lever.

4052
02:45:45,120 --> 02:45:46,480
We're okay.

4053
02:45:47,980 --> 02:45:48,660
Now...

4054
02:45:48,960 --> 02:45:50,020
There's a lever.

4055
02:45:53,180 --> 02:45:54,540
Let's just throw it again.

4056
02:45:54,860 --> 02:45:55,540
We still can.

4057
02:45:55,760 --> 02:45:56,480
There's a lever.

4058
02:45:56,500 --> 02:45:57,040
We still can.

4059
02:45:57,040 --> 02:45:57,640
Let's just throw it again.

4060
02:45:57,820 --> 02:45:58,100
Let us do it again.

4061
02:45:58,100 --> 02:45:58,220
Yeah.

4062
02:45:59,560 --> 02:46:00,000
Okay.

4063
02:46:01,480 --> 02:46:02,240
Wait, what?

4064
02:46:09,630 --> 02:46:11,230
Oh, oops, I fucked it up.

4065
02:46:12,250 --> 02:46:13,450
Okay, I figured it out.

4066
02:46:15,090 --> 02:46:16,690
I figured it out, guys.

4067
02:46:20,010 --> 02:46:20,990
There we go.

4068
02:46:25,690 --> 02:46:28,810
And then, we got to do the inside.

4069
02:46:28,810 --> 02:46:31,030
I figured it out.

4070
02:46:31,150 --> 02:46:32,430
I told you it's snapping.

4071
02:46:37,430 --> 02:46:39,650
Oh, wait, it's the other side.

4072
02:46:47,950 --> 02:46:49,090
I'm so smart.

4073
02:46:49,650 --> 02:46:50,270
Read.

4074
02:46:52,410 --> 02:46:53,370
Boy, read.

4075
02:46:54,430 --> 02:46:55,050
Family.

4076
02:46:58,810 --> 02:46:59,010
That's the answer.

4077
02:46:59,330 --> 02:47:01,550
What I alone can never be.

4078
02:47:01,950 --> 02:47:03,270
That's a shitty riddle.

4079
02:47:03,710 --> 02:47:06,370
Read your life and trace the ruins into the sand.

4080
02:47:06,730 --> 02:47:07,190
Really?

4081
02:47:07,590 --> 02:47:08,290
Yes.

4082
02:47:09,690 --> 02:47:11,510
Write family now.

4083
02:47:12,250 --> 02:47:12,870
Something happened.

4084
02:47:15,430 --> 02:47:16,130
Oh.

4085
02:47:18,430 --> 02:47:19,130
Oh.

4086
02:47:20,350 --> 02:47:21,190
It worked.

4087
02:47:21,790 --> 02:47:22,950
I did it.

4088
02:47:24,970 --> 02:47:26,050
A cave.

4089
02:47:26,730 --> 02:47:28,330
Alright, let me explore.

4090
02:47:31,070 --> 02:47:32,310
The boy is gone.

4091
02:47:35,210 --> 02:47:36,230
I'm free now.

4092
02:47:36,390 --> 02:47:37,590
Oh, there's nothing else to explore.

4093
02:47:38,050 --> 02:47:38,570
Okay.

4094
02:47:39,870 --> 02:47:41,610
I got to make sure there's no spies.

4095
02:47:42,750 --> 02:47:43,270
Alright.

4096
02:47:43,350 --> 02:47:44,430
Everything is good.

4097
02:47:44,490 --> 02:47:45,210
There's no spies.

4098
02:47:45,750 --> 02:47:46,050
Alright.

4099
02:47:46,150 --> 02:47:47,730
Nothing is stronger than family.

4100
02:47:52,530 --> 02:47:53,050
Spy.

4101
02:47:54,330 --> 02:47:54,850
Spy.

4102
02:47:55,090 --> 02:47:55,650
Spy check.

4103
02:47:56,270 --> 02:47:56,790
Spy.

4104
02:47:56,790 --> 02:47:57,090
Spy.

4105
02:48:00,230 --> 02:48:02,110
Doki, that's a regular crow.

4106
02:48:02,550 --> 02:48:03,490
They're all spies.

4107
02:48:04,070 --> 02:48:04,530
They're...

4108
02:48:06,910 --> 02:48:09,630
There's no such thing as regular crows.

4109
02:48:14,220 --> 02:48:15,060
Let's see.

4110
02:48:17,120 --> 02:48:17,680
Alright.

4111
02:48:18,100 --> 02:48:18,660
Nice.

4112
02:48:19,660 --> 02:48:20,500
Thank you.

4113
02:48:20,980 --> 02:48:24,020
Oh, they're doing like rituals and stuff.

4114
02:48:24,220 --> 02:48:25,320
Why can't I steal that money?

4115
02:48:27,180 --> 02:48:28,480
Why can't I steal money?

4116
02:48:28,480 --> 02:48:28,620
What?

4117
02:48:29,300 --> 02:48:30,340
How did I lose?

4118
02:48:30,500 --> 02:48:31,700
Oh yeah, I ran into a spike.

4119
02:48:32,020 --> 02:48:34,200
Okay, that... I was gonna say, how do I...

4120
02:48:34,200 --> 02:48:35,500
lost HP?

4121
02:48:39,240 --> 02:48:40,700
Okay, that makes sense.

4122
02:48:40,800 --> 02:48:41,820
Why my HP is low.

4123
02:48:45,090 --> 02:48:46,090
I thought I heard something.

4124
02:48:46,890 --> 02:48:47,330
What?

4125
02:48:48,990 --> 02:48:50,730
There's something on the other side.

4126
02:48:50,930 --> 02:48:51,590
I hear it.

4127
02:48:54,350 --> 02:48:55,390
I hear it.

4128
02:48:55,530 --> 02:48:56,450
I hear the...

4129
02:49:05,330 --> 02:49:06,890
What are they, boy?

4130
02:49:11,550 --> 02:49:12,930
Go, boy.

4131
02:49:13,170 --> 02:49:14,390
Track that.

4132
02:49:14,650 --> 02:49:16,070
Track that boar.

4133
02:49:19,630 --> 02:49:21,110
These are bones.

4134
02:49:21,570 --> 02:49:23,070
What the fuck?

4135
02:49:26,400 --> 02:49:27,640
Oh shit!

4136
02:49:28,480 --> 02:49:29,560
Don't worry!

4137
02:49:31,420 --> 02:49:32,340
Now!

4138
02:49:34,120 --> 02:49:35,040
What?!

4139
02:49:37,300 --> 02:49:39,340
Oh no, I have to be closer.

4140
02:49:39,880 --> 02:49:41,040
Oh no.

4141
02:49:41,440 --> 02:49:44,040
I have to be so much closer.

4142
02:49:44,440 --> 02:49:45,700
Oh no.

4143
02:49:46,120 --> 02:49:47,700
Oh no!

4144
02:49:50,600 --> 02:49:51,340
It's okay.

4145
02:49:51,520 --> 02:49:52,320
We're fine.

4146
02:49:53,960 --> 02:49:54,820
We're fine.

4147
02:49:55,620 --> 02:49:56,500
It's okay.

4148
02:49:58,480 --> 02:49:59,720
What the fuck?

4149
02:50:00,820 --> 02:50:02,100
What are you doing here?

4150
02:50:02,120 --> 02:50:03,080
This is not your fight.

4151
02:50:03,540 --> 02:50:04,140
Whoa!

4152
02:50:05,720 --> 02:50:06,360
Go!

4153
02:50:09,550 --> 02:50:10,370
That's right.

4154
02:50:10,570 --> 02:50:11,390
Oh shit!

4155
02:50:11,470 --> 02:50:11,750
No!

4156
02:50:12,430 --> 02:50:14,150
I should never get close!

4157
02:50:18,430 --> 02:50:21,080
Get close!

4158
02:50:23,600 --> 02:50:24,880
Oh god.

4159
02:50:25,060 --> 02:50:25,720
Oh god.

4160
02:50:26,760 --> 02:50:27,600
I am!

4161
02:50:27,640 --> 02:50:28,080
I'm ready!

4162
02:50:28,220 --> 02:50:28,600
I'm ready!

4163
02:50:32,810 --> 02:50:33,450
Okay.

4164
02:50:34,490 --> 02:50:35,130
Whoa!

4165
02:50:35,940 --> 02:50:36,210
Whoa!

4166
02:50:38,890 --> 02:50:39,550
That's right.

4167
02:50:39,710 --> 02:50:40,470
Get him, boy.

4168
02:50:41,290 --> 02:50:41,970
That's right.

4169
02:50:43,910 --> 02:50:44,850
What's in here?

4170
02:50:45,350 --> 02:50:46,790
Where is this behind him?

4171
02:50:49,190 --> 02:50:50,070
Oh shit.

4172
02:50:50,550 --> 02:50:51,570
It's fine, boy.

4173
02:50:52,090 --> 02:50:53,090
Just keep shooting.

4174
02:50:53,990 --> 02:50:54,790
Distract him.

4175
02:50:55,970 --> 02:50:56,870
I'll be here.

4176
02:50:58,890 --> 02:51:00,110
I'll be here!

4177
02:51:00,650 --> 02:51:01,350
That's okay.

4178
02:51:01,450 --> 02:51:02,010
I'll be here.

4179
02:51:15,170 --> 02:51:16,290
Okay, that's fine!

4180
02:51:16,410 --> 02:51:17,370
Keep being bait!

4181
02:51:17,570 --> 02:51:18,790
You're doing a great job!

4182
02:51:19,170 --> 02:51:19,990
I'm proud of you!

4183
02:51:20,430 --> 02:51:21,270
Did I say that?

4184
02:51:21,410 --> 02:51:24,170
I mean, I'm... I didn't say I'm proud of you, I'm...

4185
02:51:24,170 --> 02:51:26,710
Oh my god, okay, you get the melee treatment.

4186
02:51:26,950 --> 02:51:29,470
Like, hey, you get the melee treatment right here.

4187
02:51:29,590 --> 02:51:30,830
You're distracting me.

4188
02:51:32,490 --> 02:51:33,550
What the fuck?

4189
02:51:33,590 --> 02:51:34,150
Who is it?

4190
02:51:34,550 --> 02:51:35,650
Alright, get over here.

4191
02:51:35,730 --> 02:51:36,570
Get out here.

4192
02:51:41,130 --> 02:51:43,110
Oh shit, that's okay, we're fine.

4193
02:51:43,930 --> 02:51:44,690
We're fine!

4194
02:51:44,930 --> 02:51:45,830
We're so fine!

4195
02:51:46,550 --> 02:51:47,270
Get out!

4196
02:51:47,670 --> 02:51:49,130
This is not your fight!

4197
02:51:50,310 --> 02:51:51,310
Are you serious?

4198
02:51:54,230 --> 02:51:56,990
Don't worry, slow and steady wins the race!

4199
02:51:59,230 --> 02:52:00,090
What the fuck?

4200
02:52:00,110 --> 02:52:01,310
I heard something behind me.

4201
02:52:02,490 --> 02:52:04,130
It's okay, I hit his butt!

4202
02:52:06,790 --> 02:52:07,670
Oh shit.

4203
02:52:08,250 --> 02:52:08,770
Goodbye.

4204
02:52:09,890 --> 02:52:11,770
Oh, that's where I heard it from.

4205
02:52:12,830 --> 02:52:13,870
Oh shit!

4206
02:52:13,970 --> 02:52:14,950
Okay, that hurt.

4207
02:52:16,450 --> 02:52:17,750
Okay, get over here.

4208
02:52:17,850 --> 02:52:18,630
Get over here.

4209
02:52:19,110 --> 02:52:21,290
You're not supposed to be in this fight!

4210
02:52:23,490 --> 02:52:24,870
Boy, keep doing your thing!

4211
02:52:26,650 --> 02:52:28,330
You're doing a good job!

4212
02:52:32,010 --> 02:52:33,130
We're doing it!

4213
02:52:35,110 --> 02:52:36,590
We're so healthy!

4214
02:52:38,430 --> 02:52:40,610
You can live forever, boy!

4215
02:52:40,690 --> 02:52:41,430
Trust me!

4216
02:52:42,610 --> 02:52:45,570
They made a sequel so I know you don't die!

4217
02:52:46,870 --> 02:52:50,490
You can't die because they made God of War II, the sequel!

4218
02:52:52,550 --> 02:52:54,230
They made Ragnarok!

4219
02:52:55,790 --> 02:52:58,290
Wait, can I like... can I do this from here?

4220
02:52:58,470 --> 02:52:59,370
Oh shit!

4221
02:52:59,370 --> 02:53:01,970
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

4222
02:53:01,970 --> 02:53:02,370
Nice!

4223
02:53:06,730 --> 02:53:07,930
Here we go.

4224
02:53:09,690 --> 02:53:10,170
Easy.

4225
02:53:12,050 --> 02:53:13,010
Fucking easy.

4226
02:53:15,970 --> 02:53:16,590
That's right.

4227
02:53:18,190 --> 02:53:19,170
We did it.

4228
02:53:21,630 --> 02:53:24,030
Wait, thank you for the super chat.

4229
02:53:24,130 --> 02:53:25,330
Thank you, thank you.

4230
02:53:26,330 --> 02:53:27,510
Hey, little dokey bird.

4231
02:53:27,590 --> 02:53:29,250
We may realize this may be a bad time.

4232
02:53:29,250 --> 02:53:33,250
But we're here to collect the second brain cell you rented for today.

4233
02:53:33,630 --> 02:53:34,770
Thank you for the super chat.

4234
02:53:34,890 --> 02:53:35,490
Thank you, thank you.

4235
02:53:35,770 --> 02:53:39,230
They were human reavers, but now they embrace the way of the seer.

4236
02:53:39,330 --> 02:53:41,310
They can throw magic spells at the distance.

4237
02:53:41,770 --> 02:53:42,810
That's a lot of loot.

4238
02:53:45,990 --> 02:53:47,330
Oh, heavy runic attack!

4239
02:53:47,550 --> 02:53:48,050
I like that.

4240
02:53:50,950 --> 02:53:51,390
Nice!

4241
02:53:52,410 --> 02:53:56,590
Unlikes an additional fall attack by pressing R2 after the initial slam.

4242
02:53:57,530 --> 02:53:59,090
Oh, that's something I have to do?

4243
02:53:59,090 --> 02:54:00,590
In close range.

4244
02:54:11,650 --> 02:54:13,330
I guess.

4245
02:54:16,890 --> 02:54:18,510
Alright, what else can I unlock?

4246
02:54:23,870 --> 02:54:25,030
Rage combat.

4247
02:54:26,850 --> 02:54:28,570
Not enough expo...

4248
02:54:28,570 --> 02:54:29,370
Oh wait, do I have enough for...

4249
02:54:29,370 --> 02:54:31,090
Oh, these are what I purchased.

4250
02:54:32,050 --> 02:54:35,190
Uh, now I'm going to invest in the other stuff.

4251
02:54:35,390 --> 02:54:35,990
Expert combat.

4252
02:54:37,390 --> 02:54:37,990
Acrobats.

4253
02:54:38,890 --> 02:54:39,770
Talon bow.

4254
02:54:40,350 --> 02:54:42,730
A certain form when Kratos is attacked.

4255
02:54:44,030 --> 02:54:49,990
When Arteus is choking an enemy, he can perform a combat move.

4256
02:54:50,090 --> 02:54:51,770
A Kratos launches or hits the enemy.

4257
02:54:52,130 --> 02:54:53,950
I can throw the shield?

4258
02:54:54,170 --> 02:54:55,270
Say no more.

4259
02:54:56,290 --> 02:54:59,270
Hold L-hop to swap.

4260
02:54:59,710 --> 02:55:01,830
To break an enemy's block.

4261
02:55:03,030 --> 02:55:04,610
Where is it?

4262
02:55:05,210 --> 02:55:07,290
After performing the Guardian's...

4263
02:55:07,290 --> 02:55:07,890
Where is it?

4264
02:55:08,150 --> 02:55:09,770
Where is the shield throw?

4265
02:55:13,080 --> 02:55:14,680
Guardian countering blast.

4266
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:19,180
Say no more.

4267
02:55:19,960 --> 02:55:20,960
Guardian sweep.

4268
02:55:21,660 --> 02:55:23,220
Guys, there's no shield.

4269
02:55:23,460 --> 02:55:24,560
Oh, it's in the middle?

4270
02:55:25,820 --> 02:55:26,900
That's the...

4271
02:55:26,900 --> 02:55:27,560
Justice.

4272
02:55:28,780 --> 02:55:29,740
The slams.

4273
02:55:31,860 --> 02:55:32,560
Okay, no.

4274
02:55:36,310 --> 02:55:36,990
There's no...

4275
02:55:36,990 --> 02:55:37,870
I got baited.

4276
02:55:37,910 --> 02:55:38,970
I got so baited.

4277
02:55:39,050 --> 02:55:40,790
Do I make him do anything?

4278
02:55:41,230 --> 02:55:42,430
Is it worth it?

4279
02:55:43,370 --> 02:55:45,390
Is it worth it to make him do...

4280
02:55:45,390 --> 02:55:46,790
Oh, he's going to learn magic later.

4281
02:55:47,250 --> 02:55:48,110
Is it worth...

4282
02:55:48,110 --> 02:55:49,530
Is it worth it, guys?

4283
02:55:51,750 --> 02:55:52,950
Is it good or no?

4284
02:55:54,110 --> 02:55:54,590
Scam?

4285
02:55:55,250 --> 02:55:56,670
Is it a scam or...

4286
02:55:57,310 --> 02:55:58,090
Is it worth it?

4287
02:56:00,630 --> 02:56:01,970
It's pretty worth it.

4288
02:56:03,170 --> 02:56:04,070
He's broken.

4289
02:56:04,290 --> 02:56:05,650
Okay, which one, guys?

4290
02:56:06,150 --> 02:56:08,810
Teamwork, acrobatic, or ferocity?

4291
02:56:14,150 --> 02:56:15,330
If it's worth it.

4292
02:56:15,710 --> 02:56:16,830
Yes, that's...

4293
02:56:16,830 --> 02:56:17,990
That's not an...

4294
02:56:19,670 --> 02:56:20,790
That's not...

4295
02:56:23,050 --> 02:56:25,030
Guys, I'll pick one.

4296
02:56:25,190 --> 02:56:27,250
He deserves only one upgrade for now.

4297
02:56:27,810 --> 02:56:28,250
Like...

4298
02:56:31,030 --> 02:56:31,590
Stun?

4299
02:56:31,710 --> 02:56:31,970
Okay.

4300
02:56:33,110 --> 02:56:36,110
Yes is not, like, the answer I was looking for.

4301
02:56:36,370 --> 02:56:37,810
I gave, like...

4302
02:56:37,810 --> 02:56:39,210
I named three.

4303
02:56:41,070 --> 02:56:42,130
Did I need to turn it on?

4304
02:56:42,170 --> 02:56:43,150
Oh, the light is on.

4305
02:56:43,250 --> 02:56:43,930
Oh, my God.

4306
02:56:44,030 --> 02:56:44,670
It's like...

4307
02:56:44,670 --> 02:56:45,630
So, like...

4308
02:56:45,630 --> 02:56:46,310
Like...

4309
02:56:46,310 --> 02:56:48,790
I didn't realize the light was on.

4310
02:56:49,090 --> 02:56:49,510
Whoops.

4311
02:56:51,310 --> 02:56:52,330
Okay, let's see.

4312
02:56:53,270 --> 02:56:55,770
It did not look like the light was on just then.

4313
02:56:56,270 --> 02:56:56,870
Oh, my God.

4314
02:56:56,890 --> 02:56:57,830
I've been playing for three...

4315
02:56:57,830 --> 02:56:58,450
Oh, my God.

4316
02:56:58,450 --> 02:56:59,150
I've been playing for three hours.

4317
02:56:59,210 --> 02:57:00,470
This does not feel like three hours.

4318
02:57:00,570 --> 02:57:01,730
I've been enjoying this game.

4319
02:57:03,210 --> 02:57:05,650
Oh, I've been enjoying this game a lot, actually.

4320
02:57:05,910 --> 02:57:08,050
Because it did not feel like three hours.

4321
02:57:10,370 --> 02:57:11,570
Oh, what's this?

4322
02:57:13,330 --> 02:57:15,010
Okay, there's a chain here.

4323
02:57:15,630 --> 02:57:16,050
Oh!

4324
02:57:19,950 --> 02:57:20,450
Where?

4325
02:57:23,530 --> 02:57:24,410
Where is he reading this?

4326
02:57:26,370 --> 02:57:26,870
Like,

4327
02:57:30,150 --> 02:57:31,070
where is he reading this?

4328
02:57:31,210 --> 02:57:31,710
Like, I...

4329
02:57:34,070 --> 02:57:35,690
Oh, these runes?

4330
02:57:35,770 --> 02:57:36,390
Oh, okay.

4331
02:57:36,470 --> 02:57:37,350
I was like, where is he...

4332
02:57:37,350 --> 02:57:38,810
I don't see the words.

4333
02:57:38,850 --> 02:57:40,030
But I also can't read.

4334
02:57:40,170 --> 02:57:40,790
So, I don't know.

4335
02:57:41,330 --> 02:57:41,770
Okay.

4336
02:57:41,830 --> 02:57:43,110
I have two of it.

4337
02:57:43,310 --> 02:57:45,170
Oh, I need to find the third.

4338
02:57:46,490 --> 02:57:47,490
Where is the third?

4339
02:57:51,670 --> 02:57:52,530
Where is it?

4340
02:57:54,650 --> 02:57:57,370
The third should be nearby, but I don't see it.

4341
02:58:03,750 --> 02:58:04,190
What?

4342
02:58:05,650 --> 02:58:06,090
Behind?

4343
02:58:08,790 --> 02:58:09,450
It's behind.

4344
02:58:09,470 --> 02:58:09,990
Behind me?

4345
02:58:11,510 --> 02:58:12,270
Oh!

4346
02:58:14,430 --> 02:58:16,330
I see it, now.

4347
02:58:17,710 --> 02:58:18,590
All right.

4348
02:58:19,310 --> 02:58:23,950
And then...

4349
02:58:23,950 --> 02:58:24,130
Phew!

4350
02:58:26,170 --> 02:58:26,930
Phew!

4351
02:58:28,230 --> 02:58:28,610
Yay!

4352
02:58:29,730 --> 02:58:31,370
Okay, it's very generous.

4353
02:58:31,730 --> 02:58:33,270
It's very generous.

4354
02:58:34,690 --> 02:58:36,210
Thank god.

4355
02:58:36,470 --> 02:58:37,610
Because I was like, where...

4356
02:58:37,610 --> 02:58:39,210
Where is it?

4357
02:58:39,210 --> 02:58:39,850
Yay!

4358
02:58:40,030 --> 02:58:40,770
Maximum health!

4359
02:58:41,410 --> 02:58:42,790
I got the appas!

4360
02:58:43,650 --> 02:58:44,210
Whoa!

4361
02:58:44,530 --> 02:58:45,790
That's a lot of HP!

4362
02:58:46,690 --> 02:58:47,530
That's a lot.

4363
02:58:47,730 --> 02:58:49,510
I realized I never use my rage art.

4364
02:58:51,770 --> 02:58:53,170
I just... I don't know.

4365
02:58:53,470 --> 02:58:55,550
I just never felt like I needed it.

4366
02:58:58,210 --> 02:58:59,050
Let's see.

4367
02:58:59,850 --> 02:59:01,490
I hear the crows.

4368
02:59:02,130 --> 02:59:03,650
I hear the spies.

4369
02:59:06,550 --> 02:59:08,210
I hear them near me.

4370
02:59:11,980 --> 02:59:13,120
I hear him.

4371
02:59:13,380 --> 02:59:15,180
I know you're spying on me.

4372
02:59:15,740 --> 02:59:17,820
I know you're spying on me, croaky!

4373
02:59:18,060 --> 02:59:19,140
Where are you?

4374
02:59:24,750 --> 02:59:25,350
Okay.

4375
02:59:25,350 --> 02:59:27,190
That has to be like the rage art.

4376
02:59:28,130 --> 02:59:29,590
Uh, meter thing.

4377
02:59:31,950 --> 02:59:33,270
I hear him!

4378
02:59:33,590 --> 02:59:35,930
He's like... he's like laughing at me!

4379
02:59:38,910 --> 02:59:40,210
Oh my god.

4380
02:59:41,470 --> 02:59:42,710
He's... he's hiding.

4381
02:59:43,430 --> 02:59:44,530
He's hiding somewhere.

4382
02:59:45,190 --> 02:59:48,030
There's like a chain here, but I don't know if I can...

4383
02:59:48,930 --> 02:59:50,190
get up there yet.

4384
02:59:50,870 --> 02:59:52,310
Is there a way to get up there?

4385
02:59:52,950 --> 02:59:53,390
Guys?

4386
02:59:54,390 --> 02:59:55,050
Oh shit.

4387
02:59:55,210 --> 02:59:56,070
Did I smash that?

4388
02:59:56,190 --> 02:59:56,730
Oh, there it is.

4389
02:59:56,810 --> 02:59:57,130
Alright, boy.

4390
02:59:57,210 --> 02:59:57,770
Come over here.

4391
03:00:06,920 --> 03:00:07,360
Boy!

4392
03:00:08,540 --> 03:00:08,980
Boy!

4393
03:00:10,180 --> 03:00:11,300
Do your job!

4394
03:00:11,640 --> 03:00:12,780
Good job, boy.

4395
03:00:15,200 --> 03:00:16,080
Alright, apaco.

4396
03:00:16,640 --> 03:00:18,180
Can't hide from me, croaky.

4397
03:00:18,180 --> 03:00:20,100
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

4398
03:00:21,420 --> 03:00:22,120
Alright.

4399
03:00:22,340 --> 03:00:22,900
Read.

4400
03:00:29,140 --> 03:00:29,920
What's that?

4401
03:00:31,060 --> 03:00:32,240
What is that, boy?

4402
03:00:33,360 --> 03:00:34,340
What is that?

4403
03:00:34,560 --> 03:00:35,420
New lore?

4404
03:00:36,480 --> 03:00:38,120
From here are sacrifices.

4405
03:00:38,620 --> 03:00:42,220
Mighty Allfather and Delivered Midgard from Hell's Wild Hunt.

4406
03:00:42,580 --> 03:00:44,160
Odin, wisest of all.

4407
03:00:44,220 --> 03:00:47,680
Whose breath gave life to Ask and Emba.

4408
03:00:47,680 --> 03:00:48,800
First among our people.

4409
03:00:48,980 --> 03:00:50,240
We beg your protection.

4410
03:00:50,600 --> 03:00:53,720
Send forth your noble Valkyries to call the deathless.

4411
03:00:53,900 --> 03:00:59,180
Send forth your noble sons Thor and Balder to shield us.

4412
03:00:59,300 --> 03:01:02,320
Send forth dragons to consume the frigid horde.

4413
03:01:02,520 --> 03:01:05,380
Save our souls that we may serve you evermore.

4414
03:01:08,040 --> 03:01:08,600
Alright.

4415
03:01:11,140 --> 03:01:11,700
Cool.

4416
03:01:13,360 --> 03:01:14,240
Is that it?

4417
03:01:15,760 --> 03:01:17,040
Wait, you see the crow?

4418
03:01:18,900 --> 03:01:20,140
That means he's up here.

4419
03:01:21,840 --> 03:01:23,260
That means he's up here.

4420
03:01:24,060 --> 03:01:25,300
Where are you?

4421
03:01:26,440 --> 03:01:27,260
Where is he?

4422
03:01:27,480 --> 03:01:28,900
Did you already got one guide?

4423
03:01:29,840 --> 03:01:30,980
I got one guide.

4424
03:01:31,920 --> 03:01:33,060
I got one guide.

4425
03:01:33,500 --> 03:01:34,740
I don't see no crow.

4426
03:01:36,580 --> 03:01:38,080
Oh, you bitch.

4427
03:01:38,320 --> 03:01:40,160
You thought I didn't see you?

4428
03:01:40,240 --> 03:01:41,040
That's right.

4429
03:01:44,280 --> 03:01:45,300
Oh my.

4430
03:01:45,300 --> 03:01:46,720
That was so...

4431
03:01:46,720 --> 03:01:47,980
Oh, that's cheeky.

4432
03:01:48,060 --> 03:01:48,900
I knew I could...

4433
03:01:48,900 --> 03:01:49,820
I heard...

4434
03:01:49,820 --> 03:01:50,480
I could hear him.

4435
03:01:51,340 --> 03:01:53,480
I knew I heard him.

4436
03:01:53,760 --> 03:01:55,240
I fucking knew it.

4437
03:01:55,240 --> 03:01:56,060
I knew I wasn't crazy.

4438
03:01:57,960 --> 03:01:59,080
What the fuck?

4439
03:02:00,620 --> 03:02:02,440
I know you can break these.

4440
03:02:02,620 --> 03:02:04,560
I was like, why can't I break it?

4441
03:02:06,520 --> 03:02:07,160
That's right.

4442
03:02:07,180 --> 03:02:08,260
You can't hide from me.

4443
03:02:09,040 --> 03:02:10,580
Oh, that's where the animal is?

4444
03:02:11,360 --> 03:02:11,840
Okay.

4445
03:02:11,880 --> 03:02:13,140
That means we don't go there.

4446
03:02:14,540 --> 03:02:15,280
That means we don't go there.

4447
03:02:15,280 --> 03:02:15,360
Okay.

4448
03:02:15,360 --> 03:02:16,040
So we go this way.

4449
03:02:16,120 --> 03:02:17,140
Wait, did I come from here?

4450
03:02:17,540 --> 03:02:18,880
Where did I come from?

4451
03:02:18,940 --> 03:02:19,960
Where did I go?

4452
03:02:21,040 --> 03:02:21,940
I'm so lost.

4453
03:02:22,060 --> 03:02:22,920
Did I come from here?

4454
03:02:23,760 --> 03:02:25,220
Is this where I came from?

4455
03:02:28,720 --> 03:02:30,640
Is this where I came from?

4456
03:02:31,500 --> 03:02:31,900
Yeah.

4457
03:02:32,020 --> 03:02:32,220
Yeah.

4458
03:02:32,260 --> 03:02:33,560
This is where I came from.

4459
03:02:34,360 --> 03:02:35,460
So I saw that.

4460
03:02:35,660 --> 03:02:36,720
So where does that go?

4461
03:02:37,420 --> 03:02:39,040
Cause the board is to the right.

4462
03:02:40,220 --> 03:02:41,080
No, this is...

4463
03:02:41,080 --> 03:02:41,460
Okay.

4464
03:02:41,500 --> 03:02:41,940
No, not this.

4465
03:02:42,880 --> 03:02:44,140
I wish mom were here.

4466
03:02:44,860 --> 03:02:45,260
Okay.

4467
03:02:47,740 --> 03:02:51,820
Look, look, we all do, but you did not have to bring her up.

4468
03:02:52,760 --> 03:02:53,160
Okay.

4469
03:02:53,240 --> 03:02:53,600
It's loot.

4470
03:02:53,840 --> 03:02:54,180
All right.

4471
03:02:54,200 --> 03:02:54,520
Nice.

4472
03:02:54,580 --> 03:02:54,920
It's loot.

4473
03:02:56,120 --> 03:02:56,520
Okay.

4474
03:02:56,520 --> 03:02:57,360
It's gold.

4475
03:02:57,840 --> 03:02:58,240
Nice.

4476
03:03:00,240 --> 03:03:01,640
Boy, she literally died.

4477
03:03:01,800 --> 03:03:03,920
Like we literally burned her body yesterday.

4478
03:03:04,060 --> 03:03:04,320
I guess.

4479
03:03:04,380 --> 03:03:06,180
I mean, I mean, you're still going through it.

4480
03:03:06,220 --> 03:03:06,380
Okay.

4481
03:03:06,460 --> 03:03:06,820
I swear.

4482
03:03:06,880 --> 03:03:15,140
If you still complain about missing mom after a week, then, then we're going to have to find a way to that you, you, uh, forget your troubles.

4483
03:03:15,680 --> 03:03:21,700
When you find a way to help you unleash that anger and sadness, because I know you're still coping.

4484
03:03:24,280 --> 03:03:25,300
Why is he yellow?

4485
03:03:29,760 --> 03:03:30,780
I hear the crow.

4486
03:03:40,210 --> 03:03:42,430
I do what you said and it looked like it bounced off.

4487
03:03:43,470 --> 03:03:44,950
Could the board be magical?

4488
03:03:46,070 --> 03:03:46,570
Yeah.

4489
03:03:46,670 --> 03:03:47,430
Bounced off.

4490
03:03:47,930 --> 03:03:48,930
What do you think?

4491
03:03:49,550 --> 03:03:50,050
Yes.

4492
03:03:50,230 --> 03:03:51,570
I've ever seen.

4493
03:03:56,780 --> 03:03:57,720
I'm encouraging.

4494
03:03:58,060 --> 03:03:59,640
I'm being a good father.

4495
03:03:59,640 --> 03:04:00,080
I'm being a good father.

4496
03:04:00,080 --> 03:04:02,760
See, I heard a crow.

4497
03:04:06,480 --> 03:04:08,600
I heard you crow.

4498
03:04:09,600 --> 03:04:11,020
Where are you?

4499
03:04:13,440 --> 03:04:15,300
I know you're here.

4500
03:04:15,800 --> 03:04:18,220
I know they're not voices in my head.

4501
03:04:18,560 --> 03:04:20,340
I fucking knew it.

4502
03:04:21,480 --> 03:04:22,620
I knew it.

4503
03:04:22,640 --> 03:04:23,360
Get out.

4504
03:04:24,300 --> 03:04:27,480
I knew they weren't voices in my head.

4505
03:04:27,700 --> 03:04:28,460
Something else.

4506
03:04:29,940 --> 03:04:30,420
What?

4507
03:04:31,480 --> 03:04:32,400
What is it?

4508
03:04:34,700 --> 03:04:35,720
How could it be?

4509
03:04:37,260 --> 03:04:38,100
Oh, hey, chest.

4510
03:04:40,320 --> 03:04:40,800
Alright.

4511
03:04:41,940 --> 03:04:42,780
Do I get...

4512
03:04:42,780 --> 03:04:43,280
Oh, money.

4513
03:04:45,900 --> 03:04:47,360
Oh, that's true.

4514
03:04:47,440 --> 03:04:48,240
They could come to life.

4515
03:04:48,860 --> 03:04:49,740
That's so true.

4516
03:04:50,480 --> 03:04:50,960
Loot.

4517
03:04:52,380 --> 03:04:52,860
Yay.

4518
03:04:53,460 --> 03:04:53,940
Loot.

4519
03:04:54,300 --> 03:04:54,780
Okay.

4520
03:04:55,200 --> 03:04:57,340
Gotta make sure I got every loot here.

4521
03:04:57,500 --> 03:04:57,940
I'm gonna run.

4522
03:04:58,020 --> 03:04:58,440
Okay.

4523
03:05:00,460 --> 03:05:01,780
Do you think so?

4524
03:05:02,320 --> 03:05:02,860
Maybe.

4525
03:05:03,340 --> 03:05:04,260
Oh, coins!

4526
03:05:04,420 --> 03:05:05,220
I forgot!

4527
03:05:05,360 --> 03:05:06,980
Look at these jars!

4528
03:05:07,240 --> 03:05:08,160
There's money in jars!

4529
03:05:09,060 --> 03:05:11,180
I'm ready to break all the jars for money!

4530
03:05:13,160 --> 03:05:14,440
Oh, and upgrades.

4531
03:05:14,760 --> 03:05:16,360
Boy, I told you to stay up there!

4532
03:05:17,220 --> 03:05:18,620
Boy, you never listen!

4533
03:05:21,480 --> 03:05:24,360
Why don't you ever listen to your father?!

4534
03:05:28,460 --> 03:05:30,180
Alright, let's see...

4535
03:05:31,180 --> 03:05:34,600
Just because you can read, doesn't mean... Oh, shit!

4536
03:05:34,760 --> 03:05:36,000
What the fuck?!

4537
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:37,520
How dare you!

4538
03:05:37,600 --> 03:05:38,200
How dare you!

4539
03:05:38,980 --> 03:05:40,300
You made me melee!

4540
03:05:41,720 --> 03:05:42,640
Okay, nice.

4541
03:05:44,180 --> 03:05:46,420
That bitch made me use my hands!

4542
03:05:47,540 --> 03:05:48,500
Up close!

4543
03:05:50,740 --> 03:05:51,500
The what?

4544
03:05:52,360 --> 03:05:53,140
What is?

4545
03:05:56,940 --> 03:05:58,020
Oh, there he is!

4546
03:06:01,300 --> 03:06:02,140
Shoot him again!

4547
03:06:05,260 --> 03:06:07,300
Surely it'll work a second time!

4548
03:06:12,200 --> 03:06:14,320
Oh, I can't control him anymore.

4549
03:06:14,580 --> 03:06:15,660
He's on his own.

4550
03:06:16,060 --> 03:06:16,260
Oh!

4551
03:06:18,960 --> 03:06:20,540
Wait, he actually hit him!

4552
03:06:21,140 --> 03:06:22,600
I thought he was magic!

4553
03:06:23,360 --> 03:06:24,440
Was that a lie?

4554
03:06:29,920 --> 03:06:32,500
Damn, I'll never be fully proud of my son.

4555
03:06:34,100 --> 03:06:35,240
Alright, let's see.

4556
03:06:35,380 --> 03:06:37,240
I'll always find a way to be disappointed.

4557
03:06:40,560 --> 03:06:42,160
Where did Boy go?

4558
03:06:43,080 --> 03:06:43,680
Boy?

4559
03:06:46,480 --> 03:06:47,080
Boy?

4560
03:06:47,520 --> 03:06:48,860
Oh, I don't like this.

4561
03:06:48,980 --> 03:06:50,120
They changed the music.

4562
03:06:51,600 --> 03:06:53,420
Press square to Sean.

4563
03:06:53,660 --> 03:06:53,980
Sean!

4564
03:06:55,420 --> 03:06:56,020
Sean!

4565
03:06:58,140 --> 03:06:58,740
Sean!

4566
03:06:58,740 --> 03:06:59,060
Sean!

4567
03:07:03,600 --> 03:07:05,460
I don't know, I just thought there was loot here.

4568
03:07:05,560 --> 03:07:06,640
I know like this was it.

4569
03:07:11,580 --> 03:07:12,560
Oh shit, nice.

4570
03:07:12,620 --> 03:07:13,080
Good job.

4571
03:07:15,300 --> 03:07:16,000
Oh, there's loot.

4572
03:07:16,240 --> 03:07:17,100
Oh, there's no loot.

4573
03:07:17,460 --> 03:07:18,220
Please hurry.

4574
03:07:18,460 --> 03:07:18,740
Why?

4575
03:07:21,160 --> 03:07:22,080
Why do I need to hurry?

4576
03:07:23,100 --> 03:07:23,840
Wait, did I?

4577
03:07:23,920 --> 03:07:24,860
How do I get lost?

4578
03:07:27,640 --> 03:07:28,040
Jason!

4579
03:07:29,700 --> 03:07:30,100
Jason!

4580
03:07:30,100 --> 03:07:30,420
Jason!

4581
03:07:30,440 --> 03:07:31,340
Oh, it's this way.

4582
03:07:32,100 --> 03:07:32,620
Jason!

4583
03:07:33,720 --> 03:07:34,240
Sean!

4584
03:07:35,380 --> 03:07:35,900
Jason!

4585
03:07:38,180 --> 03:07:40,040
Okay, but what if there's loot this way?

4586
03:07:40,200 --> 03:07:41,120
But you don't...

4587
03:07:47,640 --> 03:07:48,160
Wait!

4588
03:07:48,160 --> 03:07:48,680
Why?

4589
03:07:52,460 --> 03:07:52,980
Jason!

4590
03:07:52,980 --> 03:07:54,400
Don't cross the road, Jason!

4591
03:07:57,000 --> 03:07:58,380
Oh, he stopped.

4592
03:07:58,920 --> 03:08:00,320
He stopped yelling back.

4593
03:08:01,880 --> 03:08:03,340
Jason, stay off the road!

4594
03:08:05,880 --> 03:08:06,360
Atreus!

4595
03:08:06,700 --> 03:08:07,600
Wait, what happened?

4596
03:08:08,540 --> 03:08:09,580
Who did he kill?

4597
03:08:11,140 --> 03:08:12,820
Oh no, my chest is too thick!

4598
03:08:12,980 --> 03:08:13,640
I'm sorry!

4599
03:08:13,860 --> 03:08:15,500
I had too many gains!

4600
03:08:15,640 --> 03:08:16,840
I should have wore a shirt!

4601
03:08:17,020 --> 03:08:18,360
Now I'm gonna get in scars!

4602
03:08:20,500 --> 03:08:21,440
He doesn't.

4603
03:08:21,440 --> 03:08:22,220
He's my friend.

4604
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:24,760
The boy was following my command.

4605
03:08:26,100 --> 03:08:27,200
Then help fix this.

4606
03:08:27,560 --> 03:08:28,640
Hold here, please.

4607
03:08:29,200 --> 03:08:29,960
Oh no!

4608
03:08:31,460 --> 03:08:34,060
The last of his kind in all the realm and you shoot him.

4609
03:08:34,200 --> 03:08:35,100
You needed food?

4610
03:08:35,920 --> 03:08:36,880
Target practice.

4611
03:08:38,060 --> 03:08:39,600
Oh, that's even worse.

4612
03:08:40,200 --> 03:08:41,480
I'm so, so sorry.

4613
03:08:41,660 --> 03:08:42,480
Keep that pressure on.

4614
03:08:42,480 --> 03:08:43,340
This is my third wife?

4615
03:08:43,680 --> 03:08:43,680
She's mine.

4616
03:08:43,780 --> 03:08:44,940
She should have kept a closer eye.

4617
03:08:45,160 --> 03:08:45,920
Will he die?

4618
03:08:46,120 --> 03:08:47,360
I will not let him.

4619
03:08:47,620 --> 03:08:48,100
You.

4620
03:08:48,300 --> 03:08:50,460
The arrow cut a tight way inside him.

4621
03:08:50,520 --> 03:08:52,280
Find both ends and hold them tightly.

4622
03:08:53,060 --> 03:08:53,540
Oh!

4623
03:08:55,920 --> 03:08:57,420
Start with the left side.

4624
03:08:57,580 --> 03:08:58,780
Grab it and hold.

4625
03:09:01,640 --> 03:09:02,120
Okay.

4626
03:09:02,920 --> 03:09:03,400
Okay.

4627
03:09:04,400 --> 03:09:05,280
Now pull them together.

4628
03:09:05,620 --> 03:09:06,260
Line them up.

4629
03:09:08,900 --> 03:09:09,740
So now...

4630
03:09:09,740 --> 03:09:12,320
I mean, if it's the last of the kind, he's gonna die eventually.

4631
03:09:13,280 --> 03:09:15,100
He's gonna go... They're gonna have to go extinct.

4632
03:09:17,340 --> 03:09:18,280
You're a witch!

4633
03:09:19,020 --> 03:09:20,500
I can't finish the healing here.

4634
03:09:20,980 --> 03:09:22,540
My home is just beyond the trees there.

4635
03:09:23,020 --> 03:09:23,960
You will carry him.

4636
03:09:27,710 --> 03:09:29,230
He must not die.

4637
03:09:30,410 --> 03:09:32,330
I mean, he will eventually, right?

4638
03:09:33,630 --> 03:09:34,050
Good.

4639
03:09:34,170 --> 03:09:34,490
He seems to be staying at home for now.

4640
03:09:34,490 --> 03:09:35,610
He's the last of his kind.

4641
03:09:39,250 --> 03:09:39,750
Gray...

4642
03:09:39,750 --> 03:09:40,470
Thaw...

4643
03:09:42,330 --> 03:09:44,590
Like, how would he continue the generation?

4644
03:09:48,050 --> 03:09:49,610
He's not the last of his kind!

4645
03:09:49,810 --> 03:09:50,870
There's more pigs there!

4646
03:09:58,570 --> 03:10:00,370
That's literally the same pig!

4647
03:10:05,070 --> 03:10:06,530
That's the same pig!

4648
03:10:06,590 --> 03:10:06,610
That's the same pig!

4649
03:10:06,610 --> 03:10:06,710
That's the same pig!

4650
03:10:06,710 --> 03:10:08,010
He just has yellow paint!

4651
03:10:09,050 --> 03:10:10,490
Those are normal.

4652
03:10:11,650 --> 03:10:13,610
But he's magic.

4653
03:10:13,870 --> 03:10:14,550
But he's magic.

4654
03:10:18,670 --> 03:10:21,230
Those are different pigs.

4655
03:10:21,550 --> 03:10:22,790
What makes them different?

4656
03:10:23,010 --> 03:10:25,810
He just painted one of the pigs with yellow symbols!

4657
03:10:26,090 --> 03:10:26,610
He just painted one of the pigs with yellow symbols!

4658
03:10:26,610 --> 03:10:26,850
He just painted one of the pigs with yellow symbols!

4659
03:10:28,970 --> 03:10:30,730
He just painted one of the pigs with yellow symbols!

4660
03:10:31,270 --> 03:10:32,330
Look at these...

4661
03:10:32,330 --> 03:10:34,730
There's literally two pigs in front of us!

4662
03:10:35,170 --> 03:10:35,270
There's literally two pigs in front of us!

4663
03:10:35,690 --> 03:10:36,890
There's literally two pigs in front of us!

4664
03:10:37,030 --> 03:10:39,290
The yellow paint matters!

4665
03:10:42,610 --> 03:10:43,130
It's alright.

4666
03:10:48,400 --> 03:10:49,780
It's cuz he has blue eyes!

4667
03:10:50,040 --> 03:10:51,540
Show me your eyes, other pigs!

4668
03:10:51,620 --> 03:10:53,000
I need to see your... Oh, shit!

4669
03:10:53,520 --> 03:10:55,580
Oh, shit, that's a giant turtle.

4670
03:10:59,330 --> 03:10:59,930
Whoa!

4671
03:11:00,550 --> 03:11:01,010
Whoa!

4672
03:11:01,010 --> 03:11:01,410
Is he friendly?

4673
03:11:03,570 --> 03:11:05,150
That's an SSR.

4674
03:11:05,670 --> 03:11:07,330
That's an SSR thing.

4675
03:11:07,950 --> 03:11:08,110
That's an SSR thing.

4676
03:11:11,150 --> 03:11:11,750
Whoa!

4677
03:11:12,170 --> 03:11:13,970
I need to see those pig's eyes.

4678
03:11:14,130 --> 03:11:16,750
I need to know if he's actually that special.

4679
03:11:17,190 --> 03:11:18,430
I need to know if he's actually that special.

4680
03:11:18,610 --> 03:11:19,210
Oh!

4681
03:11:19,670 --> 03:11:21,550
The turtle is like...

4682
03:11:22,290 --> 03:11:24,710
How does it not crush the house?

4683
03:11:24,790 --> 03:11:25,570
That's crazy.

4684
03:11:25,730 --> 03:11:28,310
Is there like a... Is the house at heart?

4685
03:11:30,750 --> 03:11:31,310
Oh...

4686
03:11:32,330 --> 03:11:33,790
Oh, he's not calm anymore.

4687
03:11:34,050 --> 03:11:35,310
He's freaking out!

4688
03:11:35,450 --> 03:11:36,910
He's freaking the fuck out!

4689
03:11:38,170 --> 03:11:38,730
Oh!

4690
03:11:41,770 --> 03:11:42,330
Oh!

4691
03:11:45,690 --> 03:11:47,890
Oh no, he's drooling!

4692
03:11:52,170 --> 03:11:53,010
Do you have a husband?

4693
03:11:53,130 --> 03:11:53,930
Do you have a boyfriend?

4694
03:11:54,150 --> 03:11:55,770
Are you and Peter still together?

4695
03:11:58,050 --> 03:12:00,130
Hold him still before he hurts himself.

4696
03:12:04,540 --> 03:12:05,020
Good.

4697
03:12:05,020 --> 03:12:05,500
Easy.

4698
03:12:06,900 --> 03:12:07,680
Rest now.

4699
03:12:10,040 --> 03:12:11,280
I need two more things.

4700
03:12:11,600 --> 03:12:13,680
Fresh red root growth just behind the house.

4701
03:12:13,740 --> 03:12:14,600
Can you pull a cluster?

4702
03:12:21,600 --> 03:12:22,340
What else?

4703
03:12:23,820 --> 03:12:24,900
What else do we need?

4704
03:12:25,220 --> 03:12:25,700
I...

4705
03:12:29,100 --> 03:12:30,560
I know you're a god.

4706
03:12:31,980 --> 03:12:34,180
Not of this realm, but there's no mistaking it.

4707
03:12:35,040 --> 03:12:35,520
What else do we need?

4708
03:12:36,140 --> 03:12:37,380
He doesn't know, does he?

4709
03:12:38,080 --> 03:12:39,360
About your true nature?

4710
03:12:39,560 --> 03:12:40,220
What, he doesn't know?

4711
03:12:40,600 --> 03:12:42,060
That is none of your concern.

4712
03:12:42,260 --> 03:12:45,080
The gods of these realms don't take kindly to outsiders.

4713
03:12:45,320 --> 03:12:45,900
Trust me.

4714
03:12:46,100 --> 03:12:46,820
I know.

4715
03:12:47,380 --> 03:12:51,640
When they find you, and they will, they'll make things difficult.

4716
03:12:52,680 --> 03:12:54,160
The boy will want answers.

4717
03:12:54,440 --> 03:12:55,760
That will be my problem.

4718
03:12:55,960 --> 03:12:58,220
Whatever you're hiding, you cannot protect him forever.

4719
03:13:00,400 --> 03:13:01,200
But you're right.

4720
03:13:01,200 --> 03:13:03,960
It doesn't concern me.

4721
03:13:06,560 --> 03:13:08,000
I also need lamb's cress.

4722
03:13:08,080 --> 03:13:08,500
Do you mind?

4723
03:13:09,320 --> 03:13:11,000
It's a white petal flower in my garden.

4724
03:13:11,300 --> 03:13:12,080
Just a handful.

4725
03:13:12,220 --> 03:13:13,600
I'm a witness protection, ma'am.

4726
03:13:14,260 --> 03:13:15,600
You're not supposed to know this.

4727
03:13:16,100 --> 03:13:16,580
Fine.

4728
03:13:18,060 --> 03:13:18,840
Lamb's cress.

4729
03:13:25,550 --> 03:13:26,030
Alright.

4730
03:13:26,150 --> 03:13:28,630
We gotta collect the white petal flowers.

4731
03:13:28,830 --> 03:13:30,350
I thought you said quickly.

4732
03:13:31,010 --> 03:13:32,850
He's literally slowly dying.

4733
03:13:33,150 --> 03:13:34,450
How is he magical?

4734
03:13:34,910 --> 03:13:35,390
I don't know.

4735
03:13:37,490 --> 03:13:39,070
Go pick some flowers.

4736
03:13:39,130 --> 03:13:40,350
Why am I picking flowers?

4737
03:13:40,530 --> 03:13:41,630
That's what boy is for.

4738
03:13:42,410 --> 03:13:44,270
That's literally what boy is for.

4739
03:13:44,690 --> 03:13:46,870
And I'm being put on flower duty?

4740
03:13:51,500 --> 03:13:53,720
I'm a fucking god of war.

4741
03:13:55,800 --> 03:13:56,360
Alright.

4742
03:13:56,460 --> 03:13:59,200
What does the flower even look like?

4743
03:13:59,240 --> 03:14:00,760
Is it that white one over here?

4744
03:14:01,880 --> 03:14:03,280
Oh, that's fish.

4745
03:14:03,860 --> 03:14:04,680
Never mind.

4746
03:14:04,880 --> 03:14:05,800
That's just fish.

4747
03:14:06,480 --> 03:14:08,620
Sorry, it looked like flowers from a fall.

4748
03:14:09,240 --> 03:14:10,780
I don't do flower picking.

4749
03:14:11,500 --> 03:14:13,000
Flower picking is boring.

4750
03:14:13,480 --> 03:14:13,640
I like her.

4751
03:14:13,800 --> 03:14:16,300
I mean, she lives under a turtle.

4752
03:14:16,620 --> 03:14:18,200
You are too open with her.

4753
03:14:18,440 --> 03:14:20,400
We do not know if she can be trusted.

4754
03:14:20,900 --> 03:14:22,300
She hasn't tried to kill us.

4755
03:14:22,740 --> 03:14:23,260
Yet.

4756
03:14:23,560 --> 03:14:26,400
She needs us to heal her dying pig.

4757
03:14:26,640 --> 03:14:29,560
Her dying, quote unquote, magical pig.

4758
03:14:31,500 --> 03:14:32,020
Alright.

4759
03:14:32,100 --> 03:14:32,840
Let's see.

4760
03:14:33,200 --> 03:14:34,480
What the fuck is a white flower?

4761
03:14:34,480 --> 03:14:36,580
Look, from afar, those look like white flowers.

4762
03:14:37,320 --> 03:14:38,180
That's like...

4763
03:14:38,180 --> 03:14:40,340
That looks like white flowers that are on the cage.

4764
03:14:40,500 --> 03:14:40,720
Okay.

4765
03:14:41,820 --> 03:14:44,620
You can't blame me for thinking those are flowers.

4766
03:14:46,020 --> 03:14:46,860
Oh, there it is.

4767
03:14:47,000 --> 03:14:47,700
There's the white flowers.

4768
03:14:48,380 --> 03:14:48,820
Okay.

4769
03:14:50,920 --> 03:14:51,360
Nice.

4770
03:14:52,480 --> 03:14:53,520
Oh, I just need one?

4771
03:14:54,000 --> 03:14:54,440
Okay.

4772
03:14:55,160 --> 03:14:56,140
I mean, that's convenient.

4773
03:14:56,340 --> 03:14:57,120
I just need one.

4774
03:14:57,860 --> 03:14:59,120
Is there anything else here?

4775
03:15:00,440 --> 03:15:04,760
Alright, let's go give her her pig some white flowers.

4776
03:15:05,100 --> 03:15:05,120
her pig some white flowers.

4777
03:15:08,600 --> 03:15:09,200
Hello.

4778
03:15:09,420 --> 03:15:10,640
I'll come back with flowers.

4779
03:15:11,300 --> 03:15:11,900
Hello.

4780
03:15:12,400 --> 03:15:12,400
I'll come back with flowers.

4781
03:15:13,000 --> 03:15:14,920
Bacon is pretty magical.

4782
03:15:15,280 --> 03:15:15,700
Bacon is pretty magical.

4783
03:15:16,120 --> 03:15:17,000
Are you still alive?

4784
03:15:18,180 --> 03:15:19,300
The boy is searching.

4785
03:15:19,760 --> 03:15:21,140
Perhaps he could use help.

4786
03:15:21,440 --> 03:15:23,640
Please, the salve is nothing without both...

4787
03:15:23,640 --> 03:15:24,760
Oh my god!

4788
03:15:25,000 --> 03:15:27,880
Then tell me to do it instead of giving it to the boy!

4789
03:15:28,100 --> 03:15:30,040
Apparently he can't see color either!

4790
03:15:31,180 --> 03:15:33,100
Apparently he's fucking color blind.

4791
03:15:35,740 --> 03:15:37,020
Boy, where did the boy go?

4792
03:15:39,500 --> 03:15:41,280
Where the fuck did the boy go?

4793
03:15:41,860 --> 03:15:44,220
Where the fuck did the boy go?

4794
03:15:44,220 --> 03:15:44,700
What?

4795
03:15:45,080 --> 03:15:46,060
Where is he?

4796
03:15:53,200 --> 03:15:54,600
Oh, there he is!

4797
03:15:57,380 --> 03:15:59,220
Was that the red roots?

4798
03:16:01,400 --> 03:16:03,160
You dropped your knife.

4799
03:16:03,340 --> 03:16:04,060
Little boy.

4800
03:16:17,850 --> 03:16:21,010
We lost the only thing your mother had left.

4801
03:16:24,190 --> 03:16:27,350
Clearly, I miss your mom more than you.

4802
03:16:31,900 --> 03:16:33,980
Alright, return to the witch.

4803
03:16:34,640 --> 03:16:35,920
Witch, witch, witch.

4804
03:16:36,900 --> 03:16:40,160
Create your magic healing potion for your dying pig.

4805
03:16:45,910 --> 03:16:47,270
I'm not angry.

4806
03:16:47,410 --> 03:16:49,470
I'm just disappointed in you.

4807
03:17:05,320 --> 03:17:06,040
What?

4808
03:17:12,600 --> 03:17:13,980
What do you want me to do?

4809
03:17:16,380 --> 03:17:17,100
What?

4810
03:17:21,440 --> 03:17:23,160
This mark will hide you from...

4811
03:17:25,140 --> 03:17:27,180
those who might make your journey difficult.

4812
03:17:28,760 --> 03:17:30,880
Wait, we shot him in the first place.

4813
03:17:30,980 --> 03:17:32,500
Yeah, why is she rewarding us?

4814
03:17:37,180 --> 03:17:38,300
She marked us.

4815
03:17:38,940 --> 03:17:40,100
Now we're hers.

4816
03:17:40,940 --> 03:17:42,600
Now we're magical too.

4817
03:17:45,180 --> 03:17:46,040
Oh my god.

4818
03:17:46,960 --> 03:17:49,660
We're gonna be magical as well.

4819
03:17:53,040 --> 03:17:55,220
Yeah, but we caused him to die.

4820
03:17:55,900 --> 03:17:58,880
There's a shortcut below the house that leads safely out of these woods.

4821
03:17:59,620 --> 03:18:01,080
Follow this path down.

4822
03:18:01,540 --> 03:18:03,020
Then head towards daylight.

4823
03:18:05,500 --> 03:18:07,180
And we're just like the pig.

4824
03:18:07,680 --> 03:18:08,800
Will we see you again?

4825
03:18:09,440 --> 03:18:12,360
Boy, she's like so much older.

4826
03:18:13,560 --> 03:18:14,640
Now get out of here.

4827
03:18:14,980 --> 03:18:15,860
Oh, boy.

4828
03:18:16,140 --> 03:18:16,880
Come, boy.

4829
03:18:17,000 --> 03:18:18,920
You need girls your own age, boy.

4830
03:18:25,020 --> 03:18:26,460
This underground passage...

4831
03:18:26,460 --> 03:18:28,980
The compass is displayed and point towards your...

4832
03:18:28,980 --> 03:18:31,200
Oh my god, we finally have a map!

4833
03:18:31,780 --> 03:18:32,880
...and take this.

4834
03:18:33,120 --> 03:18:36,360
You can use it to orient yourself and navigate the world.

4835
03:18:36,600 --> 03:18:39,240
It will always steer you towards your goals.

4836
03:18:39,940 --> 03:18:43,040
Oh my god, it only took three hours!

4837
03:18:43,420 --> 03:18:45,080
But we got a map!

4838
03:18:46,260 --> 03:18:47,440
We got...

4839
03:18:47,440 --> 03:18:48,920
We got a compass!

4840
03:18:49,680 --> 03:18:51,040
Oh, thank god!

4841
03:18:51,160 --> 03:18:52,480
We got a compass!

4842
03:18:52,480 --> 03:18:54,940
We already had a map, but we have a compass now!

4843
03:18:56,420 --> 03:18:57,780
Thank fucking god.

4844
03:18:59,880 --> 03:19:00,560
Wait, what?

4845
03:19:00,680 --> 03:19:01,660
Where are we supposed to go?

4846
03:19:03,380 --> 03:19:04,120
Oh, shit!

4847
03:19:04,760 --> 03:19:06,240
What the fuck is that?

4848
03:19:07,740 --> 03:19:08,720
What is that?

4849
03:19:11,400 --> 03:19:12,080
Oh, okay.

4850
03:19:13,240 --> 03:19:14,440
Alright, get over here.

4851
03:19:15,220 --> 03:19:16,520
I like how I found...

4852
03:19:16,520 --> 03:19:17,880
I was like, yeah, I can finally know where to go!

4853
03:19:17,940 --> 03:19:18,760
And I'm like, where do I go?

4854
03:19:21,000 --> 03:19:21,680
What is that?

4855
03:19:22,740 --> 03:19:23,220
That's where they're hiding in a building?

4856
03:19:23,220 --> 03:19:23,660
Nightmares.

4857
03:19:23,820 --> 03:19:24,120
Yeah.

4858
03:19:25,060 --> 03:19:25,540
What?

4859
03:19:26,940 --> 03:19:28,140
Want me to tell me...

4860
03:19:28,140 --> 03:19:34,660
I started having nightmares, I was embarrassed but she said they were another part of life and that sometimes there was beauty in the horror.

4861
03:19:35,640 --> 03:19:39,660
She always saw the upside of everything, even those creepy little floating eye monsters.

4862
03:19:39,940 --> 03:19:46,620
They're named after an older creature called a mare that sits on your chest while you sleep and feeds off your fear.

4863
03:19:47,120 --> 03:19:47,600
Nightmares.

4864
03:19:47,600 --> 03:19:48,240
They are.

4865
03:19:49,280 --> 03:19:50,780
I don't remember which.

4866
03:19:51,300 --> 03:19:52,460
I wish I could ask you.

4867
03:19:52,460 --> 03:19:53,400
How do I get that out?

4868
03:19:55,680 --> 03:19:56,500
That's weird.

4869
03:19:56,680 --> 03:19:57,500
What is that?

4870
03:19:58,860 --> 03:19:59,380
Alright.

4871
03:20:00,060 --> 03:20:02,320
Let's get rid of that jar first coin.

4872
03:20:03,620 --> 03:20:04,660
Get over here.

4873
03:20:05,600 --> 03:20:09,840
Um, so we're supposed to go there, so that means I go to the other side.

4874
03:20:10,600 --> 03:20:11,500
Alright, nice.

4875
03:20:12,920 --> 03:20:14,140
Where does this go?

4876
03:20:15,720 --> 03:20:16,240
Oh!

4877
03:20:18,320 --> 03:20:19,800
Oh, I fucking knew it.

4878
03:20:19,940 --> 03:20:21,220
I fucking knew it.

4879
03:20:21,220 --> 03:20:22,020
Get in that ocean!

4880
03:20:23,100 --> 03:20:23,540
Hahahahaha!

4881
03:20:25,800 --> 03:20:26,240
Moo.

4882
03:20:27,780 --> 03:20:28,220
Oh!

4883
03:20:31,740 --> 03:20:33,700
But I am a god!

4884
03:20:35,280 --> 03:20:37,160
Oh, nope, nope, nope, okay.

4885
03:20:38,900 --> 03:20:39,340
Um...

4886
03:20:39,880 --> 03:20:40,600
Oh, loot!

4887
03:20:47,360 --> 03:20:47,800
Nice.

4888
03:20:47,900 --> 03:20:49,360
More loot for me!

4889
03:20:50,900 --> 03:20:52,260
Wait, what do I do with this?

4890
03:20:52,420 --> 03:20:53,240
Do I just push it out?

4891
03:20:54,340 --> 03:20:55,840
I guess I'll just push it out.

4892
03:20:57,460 --> 03:20:58,260
Hey, loot!

4893
03:20:59,520 --> 03:21:00,200
Give me a sec.

4894
03:21:01,020 --> 03:21:02,260
I gotta push it out.

4895
03:21:05,000 --> 03:21:06,580
What if I can push it into the ocean?

4896
03:21:08,220 --> 03:21:09,980
Into the water you go!

4897
03:21:11,440 --> 03:21:13,240
Into the water you go!

4898
03:21:14,040 --> 03:21:14,640
Goodbye!

4899
03:21:16,980 --> 03:21:17,580
Yeah.

4900
03:21:18,340 --> 03:21:19,740
What is under the surface?

4901
03:21:25,480 --> 03:21:26,440
There's like...

4902
03:21:27,720 --> 03:21:30,460
There's the... there's the shrine thingy there.

4903
03:21:33,320 --> 03:21:34,340
Got another mask.

4904
03:21:34,820 --> 03:21:35,600
Oops!

4905
03:21:35,780 --> 03:21:36,980
That's an app, didn't it?

4906
03:21:39,220 --> 03:21:39,620
What?

4907
03:21:43,860 --> 03:21:44,420
Oh, yeah?

4908
03:21:45,460 --> 03:21:46,360
Use your arrow!

4909
03:21:46,680 --> 03:21:48,780
Clearly, it's not your fucking tool!

4910
03:21:49,480 --> 03:21:50,280
Hahahahaha!

4911
03:21:50,500 --> 03:21:52,980
Don't be a smartass, boy!

4912
03:21:53,920 --> 03:21:54,720
Hahahahaha!

4913
03:21:54,900 --> 03:21:55,560
Hahahahaha!

4914
03:21:57,280 --> 03:21:59,820
Don't be a god damn smartass!

4915
03:22:01,560 --> 03:22:02,080
Hahahahaha!

4916
03:22:04,380 --> 03:22:07,680
Okay, clearly... clearly we can't go that way yet.

4917
03:22:09,700 --> 03:22:12,660
Uh, I guess we go this... we go back this way.

4918
03:22:15,100 --> 03:22:18,720
I didn't teach you to be... to talk back to your elders.

4919
03:22:20,820 --> 03:22:22,600
Uh, Fidelis, thank you in the super chat.

4920
03:22:22,680 --> 03:22:23,500
Thank you, thank you.

4921
03:22:23,600 --> 03:22:26,980
If two witches watch two watches, which witch would watch which witch?

4922
03:22:27,460 --> 03:22:28,900
Oh, I fucked it up at the end.

4923
03:22:28,980 --> 03:22:29,400
Which watch?

4924
03:22:29,980 --> 03:22:30,380
Hahahahaha!

4925
03:22:32,400 --> 03:22:33,880
I was so confident, too.

4926
03:22:34,740 --> 03:22:35,140
Hahahahaha!

4927
03:22:37,900 --> 03:22:39,160
Is there anything in here?

4928
03:22:41,180 --> 03:22:41,820
Over where?

4929
03:22:44,420 --> 03:22:45,100
The boat?

4930
03:22:45,280 --> 03:22:46,360
I can see the boat!

4931
03:22:50,920 --> 03:22:51,320
Okay...

4932
03:22:52,260 --> 03:22:54,200
Wait, there's a... there's a chest here!

4933
03:22:55,520 --> 03:22:56,800
How do I get to that chest?

4934
03:22:57,240 --> 03:22:59,100
There was a time I thought I'd never leave a house.

4935
03:22:59,100 --> 03:22:59,100
There was a time I thought I'd never leave a house.

4936
03:22:59,100 --> 03:22:59,100
There was a time I thought I'd never leave a house.

4937
03:22:59,880 --> 03:23:01,040
Not even my own bed.

4938
03:23:01,280 --> 03:23:03,100
You were not to blame for your sickness!

4939
03:23:03,460 --> 03:23:04,160
Oh, I know.

4940
03:23:04,420 --> 03:23:05,840
I guess I'm just saying...

4941
03:23:06,260 --> 03:23:07,060
This was great!

4942
03:23:08,660 --> 03:23:09,780
Can I perch here?

4943
03:23:11,580 --> 03:23:12,880
What is this stuff here?

4944
03:23:17,260 --> 03:23:18,520
Can I come from here?

4945
03:23:23,100 --> 03:23:24,200
Well, I need a dock.

4946
03:23:24,560 --> 03:23:25,960
Where the fuck is a dock?

4947
03:23:28,900 --> 03:23:30,620
I don't think there is a dock here.

4948
03:23:30,860 --> 03:23:32,200
Oh, I'll be back later?

4949
03:23:32,420 --> 03:23:32,860
Okay...

4950
03:23:32,860 --> 03:23:33,800
Okay, I'll go this way then.

4951
03:23:38,260 --> 03:23:39,760
Alright, off we go.

4952
03:23:40,740 --> 03:23:42,520
Off we go to the lands.

4953
03:23:43,520 --> 03:23:45,960
Through the compass that the witch gave us.

4954
03:23:50,400 --> 03:23:52,060
Follow the compass maker.

4955
03:23:52,980 --> 03:23:54,520
I really like this game so far.

4956
03:23:54,780 --> 03:23:56,200
I actually really enjoy it.

4957
03:23:57,640 --> 03:24:00,500
I like the story and the battle.

4958
03:24:05,280 --> 03:24:06,220
How do you know?

4959
03:24:06,500 --> 03:24:07,700
Do you not smell it?

4960
03:24:08,060 --> 03:24:10,040
Do you not smell the sea?

4961
03:24:10,920 --> 03:24:13,820
Oh sorry, you were a house baby for a long time.

4962
03:24:14,500 --> 03:24:16,640
We kept you, you were like a bubble baby.

4963
03:24:17,020 --> 03:24:17,940
A bubble boy.

4964
03:24:18,660 --> 03:24:21,300
We kept you in that bubble for so fucking long.

4965
03:24:21,580 --> 03:24:23,980
And then when your mom died, I was like, oh no.

4966
03:24:24,520 --> 03:24:27,540
I guess I'll have to make you touch grass for once.

4967
03:24:28,460 --> 03:24:30,480
Lake of nines, oh no.

4968
03:24:30,540 --> 03:24:32,400
I never thought you'd listen when mother spoke of the gods.

4969
03:24:32,600 --> 03:24:33,580
I seldom did.

4970
03:24:34,120 --> 03:24:36,400
Did she speak of one who could feel no pain?

4971
03:24:36,920 --> 03:24:39,520
Oh, that sounds like Baldur.

4972
03:24:39,600 --> 03:24:40,860
Oh, that's Baldur?

4973
03:24:41,000 --> 03:24:43,200
An Aesir god, son of Odin and Free.

4974
03:24:43,380 --> 03:24:44,820
And Odin is king.

4975
03:24:45,260 --> 03:24:45,700
That's right.

4976
03:24:46,660 --> 03:24:47,540
Why do you ask?

4977
03:24:47,700 --> 03:24:50,440
I thought, oh, Baldur's dead already.

4978
03:24:52,180 --> 03:24:53,520
This has more...

4979
03:24:53,520 --> 03:24:57,100
Okay, I've like read so much about like mythology.

4980
03:24:57,660 --> 03:25:03,080
That I've like, all my mythology has like, like blurred together.

4981
03:25:03,580 --> 03:25:04,140
What is that?

4982
03:25:04,700 --> 03:25:07,760
So like, I blurred it with like, Marvel Baldur.

4983
03:25:07,860 --> 03:25:10,100
Because in Marvel Baldur, they killed him.

4984
03:25:15,320 --> 03:25:20,460
So like, I'm not, I don't remember if like, they all, he was also supposed to be dead too.

4985
03:25:29,090 --> 03:25:30,630
Like, he's supposed to die.

4986
03:25:31,970 --> 03:25:34,270
Unless that's before he was supposed to die.

4987
03:25:35,290 --> 03:25:36,910
Go to the middle of the lake.

4988
03:25:37,150 --> 03:25:39,190
But I want to explore the corners.

4989
03:25:39,290 --> 03:25:40,310
It's like a puzzle.

4990
03:25:40,790 --> 03:25:42,250
Is that the middle of the lake?

4991
03:25:42,250 --> 03:25:44,430
Is that it?

4992
03:25:46,150 --> 03:25:47,490
I don't like this.

4993
03:25:47,910 --> 03:25:48,870
I think I see something.

4994
03:25:49,370 --> 03:25:50,890
Just sitting there in the middle of the lake.

4995
03:25:50,890 --> 03:25:50,990
Yeah.

4996
03:25:51,130 --> 03:25:52,230
Oh, that's it.

4997
03:25:52,370 --> 03:25:52,970
That's the thing.

4998
03:26:00,900 --> 03:26:01,580
What's that?

4999
03:26:03,960 --> 03:26:04,820
What is that?

5000
03:26:07,000 --> 03:26:07,520
Okay.

5001
03:26:11,840 --> 03:26:13,200
I see rooms there.

5002
03:26:13,320 --> 03:26:14,420
And it's just...

5003
03:26:14,420 --> 03:26:15,080
I don't...

5004
03:26:15,080 --> 03:26:16,440
I can't quite make it out.

5005
03:26:16,580 --> 03:26:17,440
I might...

5006
03:26:19,520 --> 03:26:20,040
Read.

5007
03:26:20,940 --> 03:26:21,860
Boy, read.

5008
03:26:26,620 --> 03:26:28,780
This is literally your only job.

5009
03:26:30,060 --> 03:26:30,580
This is literally your only job.

5010
03:26:30,580 --> 03:26:34,360
It reads, Sacrifice your arms to the center of the water.

5011
03:26:35,340 --> 03:26:37,120
Awaken again the cradle of the world.

5012
03:26:38,300 --> 03:26:38,820
What?

5013
03:26:39,920 --> 03:26:41,720
Throw our weapons into the water?

5014
03:26:42,640 --> 03:26:44,260
Guess that won't be a problem for you.

5015
03:26:46,400 --> 03:26:47,980
Are you gonna do it?

5016
03:26:53,820 --> 03:26:55,780
Wait, am I actually going to throw my weapon?

5017
03:26:56,520 --> 03:26:57,040
Oh!

5018
03:27:09,110 --> 03:27:11,830
How did I do that with so much confidence?

5019
03:27:12,910 --> 03:27:16,570
Like, now what would I use?

5020
03:27:17,350 --> 03:27:18,710
Is that the snake?

5021
03:27:19,050 --> 03:27:19,590
Oh!

5022
03:27:40,100 --> 03:27:41,680
Is that the world serpent?

5023
03:27:42,620 --> 03:27:42,940
Oh!

5024
03:27:45,020 --> 03:27:46,460
He's going to eat the world!

5025
03:27:48,840 --> 03:27:49,880
Oh, shit!

5026
03:27:51,000 --> 03:27:53,800
Wait, I thought this was Ragnarok, not...

5027
03:27:54,500 --> 03:27:55,660
Because I kill him!

5028
03:27:55,860 --> 03:27:56,500
I know this!

5029
03:27:56,700 --> 03:27:57,680
This is, like, iconic!

5030
03:28:00,440 --> 03:28:02,680
This is an iconic fight scene!

5031
03:28:10,380 --> 03:28:11,140
Oh, shit!

5032
03:28:12,160 --> 03:28:13,180
It speaks?

5033
03:28:13,920 --> 03:28:14,500
Yeah!

5034
03:28:14,700 --> 03:28:16,020
Mom said he's friendly!

5035
03:28:16,340 --> 03:28:17,380
What is it saying?

5036
03:28:17,740 --> 03:28:18,700
I don't know!

5037
03:28:19,400 --> 03:28:20,800
Oh, he's friendly?

5038
03:28:21,760 --> 03:28:23,740
Mom said he's friendly.

5039
03:28:27,120 --> 03:28:29,700
Do not be afraid!

5040
03:28:31,380 --> 03:28:33,300
That was amazing!

5041
03:28:34,000 --> 03:28:36,140
Mom said he's friendly.

5042
03:28:36,800 --> 03:28:36,900
Wait!

5043
03:28:37,260 --> 03:28:38,540
There's a sugar boy over there!

5044
03:28:38,640 --> 03:28:39,200
See that?

5045
03:28:40,240 --> 03:28:41,780
And there's a statue of Thor!

5046
03:28:42,140 --> 03:28:44,160
Except, I can see a lot more of him now.

5047
03:28:44,740 --> 03:28:47,540
The water dropped, and the serpent rose.

5048
03:28:49,440 --> 03:28:50,680
Don't worry, he doesn't bite.

5049
03:28:52,880 --> 03:28:54,040
And there's the mountain!

5050
03:28:54,380 --> 03:28:54,920
Look it!

5051
03:28:55,020 --> 03:28:57,800
That building leads from the foot of the mountain to that golden temple.

5052
03:28:58,040 --> 03:28:59,080
Wait, where did he go?

5053
03:28:59,500 --> 03:29:00,880
It was all just under the surface.

5054
03:29:01,700 --> 03:29:02,720
Except for the statue.

5055
03:29:03,060 --> 03:29:03,880
Good thing, huh?

5056
03:29:04,180 --> 03:29:05,100
There's even a dock.

5057
03:29:05,520 --> 03:29:06,860
There, next to the flag.

5058
03:29:10,600 --> 03:29:11,380
What the fuck?

5059
03:29:11,940 --> 03:29:13,160
Oh, there he is!

5060
03:29:15,020 --> 03:29:16,580
What is he doing there?

5061
03:29:19,360 --> 03:29:20,380
Wait, I see you.

5062
03:29:25,420 --> 03:29:26,400
What is he doing?

5063
03:29:27,700 --> 03:29:28,800
Is he just chilling?

5064
03:29:29,440 --> 03:29:30,340
What is he doing?

5065
03:29:34,380 --> 03:29:39,260
What the fuck is...

5066
03:29:39,260 --> 03:29:40,080
Oh, he's just sleeping!

5067
03:29:40,840 --> 03:29:42,420
He's just sleepy, guys.

5068
03:29:45,460 --> 03:29:46,340
He's eepy.

5069
03:29:48,180 --> 03:29:50,600
He's literally just fucking sleeping.

5070
03:29:51,300 --> 03:29:51,800
Okay.

5071
03:29:53,440 --> 03:29:57,920
I wanted to, like, see what he's doing, but, like, hey, there's, like, an area here.

5072
03:29:58,060 --> 03:29:58,480
That's good.

5073
03:29:59,460 --> 03:30:03,280
He's like, alright, time to eep outside of the water.

5074
03:30:05,620 --> 03:30:06,900
That's where we live here, right?

5075
03:30:08,000 --> 03:30:10,000
Why else would it take me here?

5076
03:30:10,120 --> 03:30:11,660
Wait, what the fuck is that?

5077
03:30:12,680 --> 03:30:14,000
Oh, shit!

5078
03:30:15,300 --> 03:30:17,040
What the fuck?

5079
03:30:27,080 --> 03:30:28,760
What the...

5080
03:30:28,760 --> 03:30:32,300
What the fuck is...

5081
03:30:32,300 --> 03:30:33,220
Okay.

5082
03:30:33,360 --> 03:30:36,000
He fucking just slapped me.

5083
03:30:38,800 --> 03:30:39,640
Okay.

5084
03:30:40,440 --> 03:30:41,280
Okay.

5085
03:30:41,280 --> 03:30:45,440
Oh, he fucking literally slaps me.

5086
03:30:48,160 --> 03:30:50,900
I couldn't knock the fuck out.

5087
03:30:54,160 --> 03:30:55,680
Holy shit.

5088
03:30:55,740 --> 03:30:57,640
I was not ready for that.

5089
03:30:59,240 --> 03:31:01,340
The slap of death.

5090
03:31:03,840 --> 03:31:05,000
Well, that's cool.

5091
03:31:05,800 --> 03:31:08,400
He's literally called the World Serpent.

5092
03:31:08,520 --> 03:31:10,400
Of course he's fucking big.

5093
03:31:11,340 --> 03:31:12,740
Be not afraid.

5094
03:31:16,540 --> 03:31:18,160
Alright, we're not going back there.

5095
03:31:19,540 --> 03:31:20,480
We're not...

5096
03:31:20,480 --> 03:31:22,340
I thought I was so strong.

5097
03:31:25,580 --> 03:31:29,700
I realized I wasn't as strong as I thought I was.

5098
03:31:29,720 --> 03:31:30,220
Chat?

5099
03:31:31,440 --> 03:31:33,200
Wait, where the fuck is the...

5100
03:31:33,200 --> 03:31:34,260
Am I...

5101
03:31:34,260 --> 03:31:36,360
I'm rowing away from the dock right now.

5102
03:31:37,940 --> 03:31:39,300
Alright, it's this way.

5103
03:31:41,280 --> 03:31:41,980
It's this way.

5104
03:31:42,840 --> 03:31:43,840
Is that the dock?

5105
03:31:44,040 --> 03:31:45,140
This has to be the dock.

5106
03:31:45,320 --> 03:31:45,560
Yeah.

5107
03:31:52,470 --> 03:31:52,950
Alright.

5108
03:31:53,390 --> 03:31:53,870
Nice.

5109
03:31:56,210 --> 03:31:58,050
I acquired XP.

5110
03:31:58,390 --> 03:31:59,890
I don't know what I got.

5111
03:31:59,990 --> 03:32:00,410
Oh, okay.

5112
03:32:00,510 --> 03:32:01,190
Abandon ship.

5113
03:32:01,770 --> 03:32:02,250
Alright.

5114
03:32:02,310 --> 03:32:03,350
I found a ship head.

5115
03:32:06,880 --> 03:32:08,140
I saw a crow flying.

5116
03:32:09,180 --> 03:32:10,480
Is this the way to the mountain?

5117
03:32:11,240 --> 03:32:12,160
It would seem.

5118
03:32:12,680 --> 03:32:15,660
If it isn't the bearded beaver, it is sexy.

5119
03:32:16,280 --> 03:32:16,660
Bruh.

5120
03:32:16,660 --> 03:32:18,060
I got something for you too.

5121
03:32:19,060 --> 03:32:19,540
Bruh?

5122
03:32:20,540 --> 03:32:21,940
Well, he's tiny now.

5123
03:32:22,740 --> 03:32:23,980
None of your fucking business.

5124
03:32:24,240 --> 03:32:25,080
Now get in here.

5125
03:32:25,180 --> 03:32:26,380
I got something for you.

5126
03:32:26,480 --> 03:32:28,860
And don't go making pig eyes at my spot.

5127
03:32:29,160 --> 03:32:29,920
I saw it bro.

5128
03:32:29,920 --> 03:32:31,140
Well, he's tiny now.

5129
03:32:31,580 --> 03:32:32,020
Okay.

5130
03:32:36,690 --> 03:32:37,870
What do you think he wants?

5131
03:32:38,330 --> 03:32:39,710
To test our patience.

5132
03:32:40,250 --> 03:32:44,690
When word gets out about my new shop, folks will finally come out of hiding.

5133
03:32:45,030 --> 03:32:48,490
They'll be clawing all over each other just to catch a whiff of me.

5134
03:32:48,490 --> 03:32:49,490
You watch.

5135
03:32:52,030 --> 03:32:53,730
Oh, what does he have?

5136
03:32:55,430 --> 03:32:57,170
Wait, can I like...

5137
03:32:58,530 --> 03:32:59,050
Okay.

5138
03:32:59,170 --> 03:32:59,990
No, that doesn't work.

5139
03:33:00,250 --> 03:33:00,790
All right.

5140
03:33:00,830 --> 03:33:02,070
What do you have for me, Brock?

5141
03:33:05,820 --> 03:33:06,340
Catch.

5142
03:33:06,920 --> 03:33:07,440
Oh.

5143
03:33:08,140 --> 03:33:09,680
The pile of rocks there.

5144
03:33:10,300 --> 03:33:15,860
With that key of Yggdrasil, you can open a magic door to the branches of the world.

5145
03:33:15,900 --> 03:33:16,160
What?

5146
03:33:16,420 --> 03:33:18,480
A shortcut between the realms.

5147
03:33:18,700 --> 03:33:18,900
Oh.

5148
03:33:19,400 --> 03:33:20,220
Have you ever seen that?

5149
03:33:20,220 --> 03:33:21,260
I don't see them out in the world.

5150
03:33:21,460 --> 03:33:23,600
Use it to get back to me quick.

5151
03:33:24,220 --> 03:33:25,880
But it's only one way.

5152
03:33:26,160 --> 03:33:28,700
Straight back here and nowhere else.

5153
03:33:28,860 --> 03:33:37,520
And whatever you do, never, never, ever, never, ever throw yourself over the edge of the path.

5154
03:33:37,900 --> 03:33:39,460
Lest you want death.

5155
03:33:39,500 --> 03:33:40,860
Oh, it's fast travel.

5156
03:33:42,780 --> 03:33:43,340
Oh.

5157
03:33:44,380 --> 03:33:44,940
Okay.

5158
03:33:45,960 --> 03:33:48,000
I don't know how it can be upgraded by shop.

5159
03:33:48,080 --> 03:33:48,840
Press upgrade.

5160
03:33:49,100 --> 03:33:49,580
Okay.

5161
03:33:49,640 --> 03:33:50,200
Okay.

5162
03:33:50,220 --> 03:33:52,480
Upgrade an armor to improve its stats.

5163
03:33:57,180 --> 03:33:59,580
I don't have stuff for that.

5164
03:34:00,960 --> 03:34:01,800
Reduce this.

5165
03:34:01,840 --> 03:34:02,580
You don't need upgrades.

5166
03:34:04,160 --> 03:34:05,260
Talisman of...

5167
03:34:05,260 --> 03:34:06,860
Gain a burst of health.

5168
03:34:07,760 --> 03:34:09,420
I don't have enough of that.

5169
03:34:09,860 --> 03:34:10,500
Nope.

5170
03:34:10,860 --> 03:34:11,500
Nope.

5171
03:34:11,500 --> 03:34:12,120
Nope.

5172
03:34:12,180 --> 03:34:12,580
Okay.

5173
03:34:13,420 --> 03:34:14,060
Enchantments.

5174
03:34:14,140 --> 03:34:14,520
Oh.

5175
03:34:14,740 --> 03:34:16,400
I can enchant stuff.

5176
03:34:17,540 --> 03:34:18,180
Nope.

5177
03:34:19,560 --> 03:34:20,200
Okay.

5178
03:34:20,220 --> 03:34:21,160
Nope.

5179
03:34:24,000 --> 03:34:25,060
You don't need that.

5180
03:34:27,100 --> 03:34:29,640
Is it really worth it, guys?

5181
03:34:29,780 --> 03:34:30,960
To like...

5182
03:34:30,960 --> 03:34:31,180
Oh.

5183
03:34:31,260 --> 03:34:31,480
Wait.

5184
03:34:33,240 --> 03:34:34,040
Cool down.

5185
03:34:34,420 --> 03:34:34,660
Wait.

5186
03:34:34,700 --> 03:34:35,220
What am I crafting?

5187
03:34:35,560 --> 03:34:35,920
Axe.

5188
03:34:35,940 --> 03:34:36,200
Pommel.

5189
03:34:36,440 --> 03:34:36,960
Oh.

5190
03:34:36,960 --> 03:34:37,560
I should get that.

5191
03:34:37,820 --> 03:34:38,580
We did war.

5192
03:34:39,640 --> 03:34:40,160
Strength.

5193
03:34:40,260 --> 03:34:40,680
Luck.

5194
03:34:41,600 --> 03:34:42,120
Runic.

5195
03:34:43,260 --> 03:34:43,780
Strength.

5196
03:34:43,880 --> 03:34:44,720
Cool down.

5197
03:34:45,660 --> 03:34:46,480
Should I get?

5198
03:34:46,720 --> 03:34:47,200
Okay.

5199
03:34:49,460 --> 03:34:49,980
Okay.

5200
03:34:49,980 --> 03:34:50,200
Okay.

5201
03:34:50,220 --> 03:34:53,180
What should I get for my pommel, guys?

5202
03:34:54,780 --> 03:34:56,460
Do not upgrade.

5203
03:34:57,280 --> 03:34:57,800
What?

5204
03:34:58,480 --> 03:34:59,320
Number three.

5205
03:34:59,360 --> 03:35:00,300
The curved runic.

5206
03:35:03,080 --> 03:35:04,040
Which one should I...

5207
03:35:04,040 --> 03:35:04,980
I throw a lot.

5208
03:35:05,100 --> 03:35:05,360
Yeah.

5209
03:35:11,580 --> 03:35:12,100
Three?

5210
03:35:13,280 --> 03:35:15,060
Should I get the curved runic handle?

5211
03:35:19,320 --> 03:35:21,000
Can't blend on any success.

5212
03:35:21,140 --> 03:35:21,420
Oh.

5213
03:35:21,520 --> 03:35:22,220
Position throw.

5214
03:35:22,300 --> 03:35:22,560
Yeah.

5215
03:35:22,600 --> 03:35:22,820
I should.

5216
03:35:22,920 --> 03:35:23,240
You're right.

5217
03:35:23,520 --> 03:35:24,860
I do throw a lot.

5218
03:35:24,920 --> 03:35:25,440
I do throw a lot.

5219
03:35:25,440 --> 03:35:25,620
Yeah.

5220
03:35:26,760 --> 03:35:27,400
Okay.

5221
03:35:27,440 --> 03:35:27,840
Equip.

5222
03:35:27,900 --> 03:35:28,400
Nice.

5223
03:35:29,220 --> 03:35:30,100
All right.

5224
03:35:30,120 --> 03:35:30,680
We got that.

5225
03:35:30,980 --> 03:35:31,300
All right.

5226
03:35:31,300 --> 03:35:31,660
Fine.

5227
03:35:32,140 --> 03:35:32,580
Fine.

5228
03:35:32,640 --> 03:35:34,720
The boy gets an upgrade.

5229
03:35:35,720 --> 03:35:36,360
Fine.

5230
03:35:37,040 --> 03:35:38,460
Reduces the charge.

5231
03:35:40,120 --> 03:35:40,760
Oh.

5232
03:35:40,960 --> 03:35:41,780
New talent.

5233
03:35:42,000 --> 03:35:42,540
Bow skills.

5234
03:35:42,900 --> 03:35:43,100
Oh.

5235
03:35:43,120 --> 03:35:43,400
I guess.

5236
03:35:43,560 --> 03:35:44,220
All right.

5237
03:35:44,640 --> 03:35:45,800
Bow or quiver.

5238
03:35:46,040 --> 03:35:46,680
Chat.

5239
03:35:46,880 --> 03:35:48,080
Bow or quiver.

5240
03:35:48,160 --> 03:35:49,640
He gets one upgrade.

5241
03:35:49,860 --> 03:35:52,280
I feel a little gener...

5242
03:35:52,280 --> 03:35:52,480
Boo.

5243
03:35:54,620 --> 03:35:55,420
Someone said bow.

5244
03:35:55,440 --> 03:35:56,260
Chat was like, boo.

5245
03:36:01,620 --> 03:36:02,240
No.

5246
03:36:02,380 --> 03:36:03,560
You can't do both.

5247
03:36:03,760 --> 03:36:04,580
It's only one.

5248
03:36:04,800 --> 03:36:06,620
I'm only allowing one.

5249
03:36:08,700 --> 03:36:10,520
You got to pick one.

5250
03:36:10,720 --> 03:36:11,340
Chat.

5251
03:36:11,420 --> 03:36:14,120
He only deserves one upgrade.

5252
03:36:15,520 --> 03:36:16,320
All right.

5253
03:36:16,360 --> 03:36:17,340
I'll give them the bow.

5254
03:36:21,960 --> 03:36:23,200
All right.

5255
03:36:23,200 --> 03:36:23,480
Boy.

5256
03:36:24,800 --> 03:36:25,420
Don't be a fool.

5257
03:36:25,420 --> 03:36:26,700
Don't waste my efforts.

5258
03:36:31,000 --> 03:36:34,140
So you're sticking around for grains of wisdom?

5259
03:36:34,940 --> 03:36:35,400
Yeah.

5260
03:36:35,480 --> 03:36:35,700
Sure.

5261
03:36:35,840 --> 03:36:36,300
What do you have?

5262
03:36:37,800 --> 03:36:38,260
No.

5263
03:36:38,420 --> 03:36:38,740
Okay.

5264
03:36:39,140 --> 03:36:39,840
All right.

5265
03:36:39,860 --> 03:36:41,060
I was waiting for some wisdom.

5266
03:36:43,100 --> 03:36:43,560
Okay.

5267
03:36:43,620 --> 03:36:44,900
That's the one that I got.

5268
03:36:47,140 --> 03:36:47,600
Okay.

5269
03:36:49,320 --> 03:36:52,100
Do I have any new enchantments that I can put on?

5270
03:36:53,300 --> 03:36:53,760
No.

5271
03:36:53,820 --> 03:36:54,200
Okay.

5272
03:36:54,660 --> 03:36:55,120
Oh.

5273
03:36:55,140 --> 03:36:55,400
Bless you.

5274
03:36:55,420 --> 03:36:55,680
I have skills.

5275
03:36:55,680 --> 03:36:56,920
Can I afford new skills now?

5276
03:36:58,000 --> 03:36:58,520
Oh.

5277
03:36:58,560 --> 03:36:58,840
I can.

5278
03:36:59,740 --> 03:37:06,080
After landing, weak points press triangle during the flash to recall and cause next throw to min...

5279
03:37:06,080 --> 03:37:06,320
Oh.

5280
03:37:06,420 --> 03:37:07,300
That's cool.

5281
03:37:09,060 --> 03:37:10,200
What does it look like?

5282
03:37:11,400 --> 03:37:11,920
Okay.

5283
03:37:12,720 --> 03:37:13,640
I'm going to get that.

5284
03:37:18,200 --> 03:37:19,780
I have just enough.

5285
03:37:20,480 --> 03:37:21,000
Yeah.

5286
03:37:22,860 --> 03:37:23,680
All in.

5287
03:37:24,240 --> 03:37:25,400
You'll get your upgrade soon.

5288
03:37:25,420 --> 03:37:25,960
It's one day, boy.

5289
03:37:27,060 --> 03:37:27,740
What's this?

5290
03:37:27,880 --> 03:37:29,060
This is the fast travel, right?

5291
03:37:35,360 --> 03:37:35,880
Oh.

5292
03:37:36,020 --> 03:37:36,680
I see.

5293
03:37:41,180 --> 03:37:42,660
Where can I go though?

5294
03:37:45,120 --> 03:37:45,980
Is that it?

5295
03:37:46,220 --> 03:37:47,220
Where the fuck is...

5296
03:37:48,120 --> 03:37:48,640
Where...

5297
03:37:48,640 --> 03:37:50,240
I can't go anywhere else.

5298
03:37:50,740 --> 03:37:52,280
I can't.

5299
03:37:52,440 --> 03:37:53,100
All right.

5300
03:37:53,300 --> 03:37:54,940
Can't really go anywhere else.

5301
03:37:54,940 --> 03:37:55,480
I see.

5302
03:37:56,340 --> 03:37:56,860
Boom.

5303
03:37:57,580 --> 03:37:58,780
But what if I...

5304
03:37:58,780 --> 03:38:00,620
I charge it.

5305
03:38:01,460 --> 03:38:02,160
I charge it.

5306
03:38:03,040 --> 03:38:03,600
No.

5307
03:38:03,740 --> 03:38:04,560
That's not it.

5308
03:38:06,820 --> 03:38:07,500
All right.

5309
03:38:07,540 --> 03:38:07,900
Let's go.

5310
03:38:11,580 --> 03:38:12,740
Nowhere for now.

5311
03:38:13,900 --> 03:38:14,180
Yeah.

5312
03:38:16,860 --> 03:38:19,280
I know there is a crow.

5313
03:38:19,480 --> 03:38:20,280
I saw him.

5314
03:38:20,740 --> 03:38:22,180
I saw him flying.

5315
03:38:23,060 --> 03:38:27,780
I saw that green bastard flying around as if he owns the place.

5316
03:38:31,120 --> 03:38:32,120
There he is.

5317
03:38:32,180 --> 03:38:33,020
See I told you.

5318
03:38:33,560 --> 03:38:34,860
I knew I saw him!

5319
03:38:35,300 --> 03:38:36,440
That's fucking right.

5320
03:38:37,600 --> 03:38:38,660
Government spies.

5321
03:38:40,000 --> 03:38:41,100
Government spies.

5322
03:38:41,420 --> 03:38:41,600
What?

5323
03:38:47,880 --> 03:38:50,220
Look, I'm doing something very important right now.

5324
03:38:51,020 --> 03:38:52,400
Okay, it will work.

5325
03:38:56,440 --> 03:39:00,040
Okay, maybe like... Okay, never mind.

5326
03:39:00,160 --> 03:39:00,580
Never mind.

5327
03:39:09,560 --> 03:39:12,540
Clearly, I was not paying attention.

5328
03:39:16,420 --> 03:39:21,660
I was not paying attention, guys.

5329
03:39:24,640 --> 03:39:26,720
Wait, what the fuck?

5330
03:39:26,880 --> 03:39:28,380
He, like, regenerated.

5331
03:39:28,720 --> 03:39:32,160
Little does he know, it doesn't matter.

5332
03:39:36,220 --> 03:39:38,300
Alright, here we go again.

5333
03:39:39,160 --> 03:39:39,680
Alright.

5334
03:39:40,080 --> 03:39:40,820
Don't worry.

5335
03:39:41,140 --> 03:39:42,440
I will hit this.

5336
03:39:43,420 --> 03:39:45,000
I will hit this.

5337
03:39:45,240 --> 03:39:47,800
There has to be an easier way!

5338
03:39:49,640 --> 03:39:50,160
Okay.

5339
03:39:53,140 --> 03:39:53,660
Alright.

5340
03:39:55,240 --> 03:39:56,140
Let's see.

5341
03:39:56,360 --> 03:39:57,100
I know the pattern.

5342
03:39:59,340 --> 03:40:00,940
Are you fucking kidding?

5343
03:40:01,040 --> 03:40:01,700
Okay, I'm gonna get closer.

5344
03:40:05,080 --> 03:40:05,600
Alright.

5345
03:40:06,700 --> 03:40:07,780
Here we go, here we go.

5346
03:40:07,960 --> 03:40:08,660
This is the pattern.

5347
03:40:14,480 --> 03:40:16,620
Are you fucking kidding me?

5348
03:40:17,480 --> 03:40:18,960
Are you fucking kidding me?

5349
03:40:19,480 --> 03:40:21,000
I will get this!

5350
03:40:24,860 --> 03:40:27,040
It cannot be impossible!

5351
03:40:27,620 --> 03:40:28,220
It cannot be impossible!

5352
03:40:28,220 --> 03:40:28,980
Wait, there's a chest here.

5353
03:40:32,600 --> 03:40:33,980
It can't be impossible.

5354
03:40:34,220 --> 03:40:34,900
There's no way.

5355
03:40:36,060 --> 03:40:36,660
It can't be impossible.

5356
03:40:36,660 --> 03:40:36,660
There's no way.

5357
03:40:36,660 --> 03:40:37,260
There's no way.

5358
03:40:37,500 --> 03:40:38,100
Boy!

5359
03:40:38,380 --> 03:40:39,220
Shoot him!

5360
03:40:39,500 --> 03:40:40,620
Shoot him, boy!

5361
03:40:44,380 --> 03:40:45,960
I will prove you wrong.

5362
03:40:46,040 --> 03:40:46,440
I will prove you wrong.

5363
03:40:49,780 --> 03:40:51,160
There has to be a way.

5364
03:40:51,220 --> 03:40:51,320
There has to be a way.

5365
03:40:51,320 --> 03:40:52,020
No, there's no way.

5366
03:40:52,120 --> 03:40:53,520
There's no way it's impossible.

5367
03:40:54,200 --> 03:40:55,860
I will time the...

5368
03:40:57,040 --> 03:40:58,580
I will time this perfectly.

5369
03:40:59,200 --> 03:40:59,720
I will time the...

5370
03:41:00,480 --> 03:41:01,100
Okay, wait.

5371
03:41:01,260 --> 03:41:02,720
But what if I, like, hit here?

5372
03:41:03,060 --> 03:41:03,400
Okay.

5373
03:41:04,680 --> 03:41:05,020
Boy!

5374
03:41:09,450 --> 03:41:10,250
Here, this is it!

5375
03:41:10,290 --> 03:41:10,590
This is it!

5376
03:41:10,630 --> 03:41:11,030
This is it!

5377
03:41:11,030 --> 03:41:11,430
This is it!

5378
03:41:11,450 --> 03:41:11,850
This is it!

5379
03:41:11,910 --> 03:41:12,730
I can feel it.

5380
03:41:19,900 --> 03:41:20,240
Okay.

5381
03:41:20,360 --> 03:41:20,940
No, no, no.

5382
03:41:20,940 --> 03:41:21,340
This is it!

5383
03:41:21,380 --> 03:41:21,780
This is it!

5384
03:41:21,780 --> 03:41:22,260
This is it!

5385
03:41:25,540 --> 03:41:26,360
This is right here.

5386
03:41:30,240 --> 03:41:31,720
Okay, I timed it incorrectly.

5387
03:41:32,000 --> 03:41:32,560
This is it!

5388
03:41:32,640 --> 03:41:33,180
Right here!

5389
03:41:33,620 --> 03:41:35,080
I timed it incorrectly!

5390
03:41:40,430 --> 03:41:41,770
Are you fucking...

5391
03:41:42,750 --> 03:41:43,730
Fuck this!

5392
03:41:44,230 --> 03:41:45,410
Fuck this bird!

5393
03:41:45,930 --> 03:41:47,910
Fuck this bird!

5394
03:41:50,430 --> 03:41:51,990
God damn it!

5395
03:41:52,510 --> 03:41:53,870
Okay, we're gonna...

5396
03:41:53,870 --> 03:41:55,110
We're gonna...

5397
03:41:55,110 --> 03:41:57,130
We're gonna go downstairs.

5398
03:41:57,430 --> 03:41:58,590
We're gonna go...

5399
03:41:58,590 --> 03:41:59,850
There's another crow?

5400
03:42:00,290 --> 03:42:02,350
How did I miss another spy?

5401
03:42:04,570 --> 03:42:05,910
There's a crow here?

5402
03:42:06,210 --> 03:42:07,430
I don't see no crow.

5403
03:42:07,870 --> 03:42:09,670
That's a seagull, you idiots.

5404
03:42:10,990 --> 03:42:12,770
Where's that fucking other crow?

5405
03:42:13,850 --> 03:42:15,590
That tried to fuck with me.

5406
03:42:16,290 --> 03:42:16,730
Okay.

5407
03:42:17,910 --> 03:42:19,210
I'm gonna get... I'm gonna get there.

5408
03:42:19,370 --> 03:42:21,730
I'm gonna fucking row my boat over there.

5409
03:42:21,790 --> 03:42:22,990
It's the last thing I do.

5410
03:42:24,910 --> 03:42:25,870
Stupid crows.

5411
03:42:27,990 --> 03:42:29,950
Stupid government spy drones.

5412
03:42:30,470 --> 03:42:31,950
Stupid government spy drones.

5413
03:42:32,230 --> 03:42:33,710
Wait, what's that over there?

5414
03:42:34,090 --> 03:42:35,470
Is that Doc over there?

5415
03:42:37,470 --> 03:42:38,370
I can't tell.

5416
03:42:38,770 --> 03:42:39,990
I'm gonna go this way first.

5417
03:42:45,040 --> 03:42:47,480
I wish we could have gone on a trip like this with Mother.

5418
03:42:48,260 --> 03:42:49,420
I wish we could have gone on a trip like this with Mother.

5419
03:42:51,060 --> 03:42:52,220
All right, here you go.

5420
03:42:53,580 --> 03:42:54,260
All right, here you go.

5421
03:42:57,110 --> 03:42:59,110
All right, one...

5422
03:42:59,110 --> 03:42:59,670
Wait, what?

5423
03:43:00,850 --> 03:43:01,610
Oh shit.

5424
03:43:01,810 --> 03:43:02,510
Get down.

5425
03:43:03,090 --> 03:43:03,890
Get down.

5426
03:43:07,010 --> 03:43:08,150
What the fuck?

5427
03:43:08,210 --> 03:43:09,190
I thought you were dead!

5428
03:43:09,410 --> 03:43:10,090
Get down!

5429
03:43:13,230 --> 03:43:14,510
All right, boy.

5430
03:43:14,730 --> 03:43:15,330
This is time.

5431
03:43:16,410 --> 03:43:17,310
Show yourself.

5432
03:43:17,670 --> 03:43:19,250
Show that you're good at this.

5433
03:43:19,930 --> 03:43:21,290
All right, let's see.

5434
03:43:23,130 --> 03:43:24,650
Where is it?

5435
03:43:24,890 --> 03:43:26,030
Oh, there's a...

5436
03:43:26,030 --> 03:43:26,730
There's a thing there.

5437
03:43:27,850 --> 03:43:28,350
Okay.

5438
03:43:29,900 --> 03:43:30,250
What?

5439
03:43:32,000 --> 03:43:32,350
What?

5440
03:43:33,090 --> 03:43:34,130
Do I need to...

5441
03:43:34,130 --> 03:43:34,610
Boy?

5442
03:43:36,990 --> 03:43:37,690
What?

5443
03:43:39,130 --> 03:43:40,370
What do I have to do?

5444
03:43:44,000 --> 03:43:44,350
Oh!

5445
03:43:48,760 --> 03:43:49,460
What?

5446
03:43:51,660 --> 03:43:52,360
Oh!

5447
03:43:52,800 --> 03:43:53,260
Oh!

5448
03:43:58,680 --> 03:44:00,680
Okay, now I know!

5449
03:44:00,920 --> 03:44:03,000
Okay, now I know!

5450
03:44:03,000 --> 03:44:03,400
Guys, now I know.

5451
03:44:04,380 --> 03:44:05,420
Guys, now I know.

5452
03:44:05,420 --> 03:44:05,940
Guys, I'm learning.

5453
03:44:06,520 --> 03:44:08,320
Guys, I'm learning.

5454
03:44:11,420 --> 03:44:14,660
I thought I could just break it!

5455
03:44:15,180 --> 03:44:18,200
I thought I could just break it.

5456
03:44:19,380 --> 03:44:20,680
I'm a god!

5457
03:44:20,800 --> 03:44:22,500
I should be strong enough!

5458
03:44:23,180 --> 03:44:23,800
That...

5459
03:44:24,460 --> 03:44:26,360
I should be strong enough to break those.

5460
03:44:26,920 --> 03:44:28,640
I'm a fucking god.

5461
03:44:30,320 --> 03:44:30,960
Read.

5462
03:44:42,040 --> 03:44:43,380
Oh, a treasure map.

5463
03:44:43,700 --> 03:44:44,600
Hunter's Kingdom.

5464
03:44:44,860 --> 03:44:45,760
Find the location.

5465
03:44:46,080 --> 03:44:46,900
Oh no, I missed it.

5466
03:44:47,180 --> 03:44:48,220
What was it?

5467
03:44:48,260 --> 03:44:48,860
Where was it?

5468
03:44:50,160 --> 03:44:51,140
Hunter's Kingdom.

5469
03:44:52,520 --> 03:44:53,380
Is this?

5470
03:44:53,880 --> 03:44:55,480
Where the fuck is it?

5471
03:44:55,480 --> 03:44:57,320
Is it in the map?

5472
03:45:05,300 --> 03:45:06,060
Oh no.

5473
03:45:07,340 --> 03:45:08,940
Where's the Hunter's Kingdom shit?

5474
03:45:10,320 --> 03:45:10,960
Where?

5475
03:45:11,780 --> 03:45:13,140
It's above me?

5476
03:45:13,320 --> 03:45:13,660
Oh.

5477
03:45:15,340 --> 03:45:16,200
Oh, okay.

5478
03:45:17,760 --> 03:45:19,020
How do I get out of here?

5479
03:45:19,920 --> 03:45:20,560
Exit.

5480
03:45:20,840 --> 03:45:21,680
Oh, okay.

5481
03:45:21,720 --> 03:45:22,040
Exit.

5482
03:45:23,280 --> 03:45:24,260
It's above me?

5483
03:45:25,360 --> 03:45:26,000
Where?

5484
03:45:29,120 --> 03:45:29,760
Codex.

5485
03:45:30,120 --> 03:45:30,760
Journey.

5486
03:45:30,760 --> 03:45:32,080
Oh, there it is.

5487
03:45:33,180 --> 03:45:35,180
I came to this kingdom to...

5488
03:45:35,180 --> 03:45:37,000
I leave this offering in memory.

5489
03:45:37,080 --> 03:45:39,700
All I find was death and sorrow.

5490
03:45:39,880 --> 03:45:45,920
I leave this offering in memory of those who suffered in the Dwarf King's quest for glory.

5491
03:45:46,280 --> 03:45:47,200
If he had...

5492
03:45:47,200 --> 03:45:48,960
Okay, where is that?

5493
03:45:49,420 --> 03:45:51,400
Where the fuck is that?

5494
03:45:52,660 --> 03:45:52,980
Uh...

5495
03:45:54,000 --> 03:45:54,920
Alright, guys.

5496
03:45:54,960 --> 03:45:56,460
Point on the map where it is.

5497
03:45:56,700 --> 03:45:57,320
Yeah.

5498
03:45:58,840 --> 03:46:00,020
YouTube, please.

5499
03:46:00,760 --> 03:46:01,220
Uh...

5500
03:46:01,820 --> 03:46:04,660
Now guys, point at the map where that is.

5501
03:46:04,860 --> 03:46:05,300
Everybody.

5502
03:46:06,080 --> 03:46:07,200
Can I break that?

5503
03:46:09,160 --> 03:46:09,720
No.

5504
03:46:10,420 --> 03:46:12,460
Wait, how the fuck do I break this then?

5505
03:46:17,600 --> 03:46:18,840
How do I break that?

5506
03:46:19,880 --> 03:46:21,700
Clearly this is breakable.

5507
03:46:24,520 --> 03:46:26,040
Does that get rid of that?

5508
03:46:29,600 --> 03:46:30,160
Alright.

5509
03:46:31,700 --> 03:46:33,560
Can I shoot it from here?

5510
03:46:38,410 --> 03:46:39,390
Alright, this is it.

5511
03:46:39,430 --> 03:46:40,210
We're closer now.

5512
03:46:42,310 --> 03:46:43,350
We're closer.

5513
03:46:43,950 --> 03:46:44,590
How?

5514
03:46:44,910 --> 03:46:46,930
I can't look high enough.

5515
03:46:48,990 --> 03:46:49,630
How?

5516
03:46:52,370 --> 03:46:53,010
How?

5517
03:46:54,270 --> 03:46:54,910
How?

5518
03:46:55,230 --> 03:46:57,270
How do I kill you?

5519
03:46:58,950 --> 03:47:00,190
Oh my god.

5520
03:47:00,270 --> 03:47:00,930
Okay, here.

5521
03:47:01,050 --> 03:47:01,750
Let's see.

5522
03:47:02,410 --> 03:47:04,430
I will kill this fucking bird.

5523
03:47:04,430 --> 03:47:06,330
I need to time this correctly.

5524
03:47:07,990 --> 03:47:08,870
There we go.

5525
03:47:09,650 --> 03:47:11,190
God damn it!

5526
03:47:14,030 --> 03:47:16,070
How do I kill you?

5527
03:47:16,190 --> 03:47:18,130
You fucking flying rat!

5528
03:47:22,050 --> 03:47:24,410
This goddamn flying rat.

5529
03:47:27,780 --> 03:47:29,800
This goddamn stupid...

5530
03:47:30,500 --> 03:47:31,300
Oh, right here, right here.

5531
03:47:31,340 --> 03:47:31,720
This is it.

5532
03:47:31,720 --> 03:47:33,720
This is the golden area.

5533
03:47:36,320 --> 03:47:36,960
Alright.

5534
03:47:39,980 --> 03:47:41,260
Oh my god.

5535
03:47:41,320 --> 03:47:41,940
I don't know!

5536
03:47:42,000 --> 03:47:43,120
I don't have depth perception!

5537
03:47:43,540 --> 03:47:44,720
I can't tell!

5538
03:47:46,760 --> 03:47:48,320
I can't tell!

5539
03:47:48,560 --> 03:47:52,960
I can't tell that it's closer now!

5540
03:47:53,020 --> 03:47:54,380
I don't have depth perception!

5541
03:47:55,080 --> 03:47:55,700
Oh my god.

5542
03:47:58,080 --> 03:48:01,620
I can't tell that it's closer now!

5543
03:48:01,620 --> 03:48:03,180
Right here, right here, right here.

5544
03:48:04,670 --> 03:48:06,300
Are you fucking kidding me?

5545
03:48:06,600 --> 03:48:08,830
Are you fucking kidding me?

5546
03:48:14,800 --> 03:48:17,030
Oh my god, we did it.

5547
03:48:17,210 --> 03:48:20,030
We fucking did it.

5548
03:48:20,070 --> 03:48:21,050
Holy shit.

5549
03:48:21,310 --> 03:48:22,810
Is there a way to get up here?

5550
03:48:26,560 --> 03:48:27,700
What's that sound?

5551
03:48:28,740 --> 03:48:29,800
You hear that?

5552
03:48:31,340 --> 03:48:32,500
What's that sound?

5553
03:48:32,500 --> 03:48:32,500
Yeah.

5554
03:48:33,380 --> 03:48:34,760
Is there a way to get up here?

5555
03:48:35,100 --> 03:48:36,600
We fucking did it.

5556
03:48:36,700 --> 03:48:38,180
I can't believe it.

5557
03:48:38,740 --> 03:48:40,100
Or is that for later?

5558
03:48:41,500 --> 03:48:42,060
Later?

5559
03:48:42,220 --> 03:48:43,180
Okay, let's leave.

5560
03:48:43,540 --> 03:48:44,740
All right, we'll go back.

5561
03:48:46,720 --> 03:48:49,000
The government can't find me now.

5562
03:48:51,480 --> 03:48:54,660
Oh shit, that made me so tired.

5563
03:48:56,980 --> 03:48:59,360
I'm so tired after that.

5564
03:48:59,740 --> 03:49:01,660
That was fucking terrible.

5565
03:49:02,500 --> 03:49:02,520
Haha.

5566
03:49:10,760 --> 03:49:13,240
Oh shit, that's the portal people.

5567
03:49:14,300 --> 03:49:15,740
That's the portal people.

5568
03:49:21,880 --> 03:49:23,080
Sounds... fun?

5569
03:49:24,040 --> 03:49:25,200
Do you remember any?

5570
03:49:25,700 --> 03:49:25,920
Hm.

5571
03:49:26,660 --> 03:49:29,720
There was one that concerned the hair and the tortoise.

5572
03:49:29,740 --> 03:49:30,240
Enough.

5573
03:49:30,860 --> 03:49:32,480
I'm not gonna touch that.

5574
03:49:32,480 --> 03:49:33,260
Watch the hole again.

5575
03:49:37,340 --> 03:49:38,620
Wings, thank you for the super chat.

5576
03:49:38,700 --> 03:49:39,560

5581
03:49:49,340 --> 03:49:50,080
Thank you, thank you.

5582
03:49:51,480 --> 03:49:52,480
Fuck that crow.

5583
03:49:53,800 --> 03:49:55,680
Don't fuck the crow, but fuck that crow.

5584
03:50:03,000 --> 03:50:04,360
Alright, let's see.

5585
03:50:07,380 --> 03:50:08,400
Oh, there's a chest.

5586
03:50:08,560 --> 03:50:09,420
Oh, boy, read.

5587
03:50:11,820 --> 03:50:12,260
Boom.

5588
03:50:13,880 --> 03:50:15,640
Alright, gotta grab some loot first.

5589
03:50:16,740 --> 03:50:17,180
Boom.

5590
03:50:19,020 --> 03:50:20,300
Alright, boy, read.

5591
03:50:20,300 --> 03:50:20,940
It's time.

5592
03:50:26,000 --> 03:50:27,840
Rico, thank you for the super chat.

5593
03:50:27,960 --> 03:50:28,880
Thank you, thank you.

5594
03:50:29,100 --> 03:50:32,100
You missed almost as many shots as I got.

5595
03:50:32,200 --> 03:50:33,660
You played Apex.

5596
03:50:35,560 --> 03:50:37,400
Boy, what's the point of bringing you up here?

5597
03:50:37,420 --> 03:50:38,740
You can't read, boy.

5598
03:50:40,780 --> 03:50:42,500
Literally, your job was to read.

5599
03:50:42,600 --> 03:50:43,940
How do you fuck that up?

5600
03:50:45,620 --> 03:50:47,480
That was your entire career.

5601
03:50:51,700 --> 03:50:52,980
Oh, it's just loot.

5602
03:50:53,660 --> 03:50:54,520
Wait, I'm back here.

5603
03:50:54,620 --> 03:50:55,560
Wait, how did my boat get here?

5604
03:50:56,500 --> 03:50:57,280
What the fuck?

5605
03:50:58,480 --> 03:50:59,920
How did my boat get here?

5606
03:51:00,200 --> 03:51:01,480
Oh, is this a second boat?

5607
03:51:01,660 --> 03:51:03,040
There's more than one boats?

5608
03:51:03,800 --> 03:51:04,680
Oh, my God.

5609
03:51:04,860 --> 03:51:06,720
Wait, I can have more than one boat?

5610
03:51:07,620 --> 03:51:08,860
That's absolute crazy.

5611
03:51:09,860 --> 03:51:10,880
I got loot.

5612
03:51:13,460 --> 03:51:14,520
What's over here?

5613
03:51:20,300 --> 03:51:21,600
Is this another boat?

5614
03:51:22,680 --> 03:51:23,320
Oh!

5615
03:51:25,160 --> 03:51:26,360
It is something.

5616
03:51:26,820 --> 03:51:27,600
What's this?

5617
03:51:28,580 --> 03:51:29,640
What's this, boy?

5618
03:51:33,510 --> 03:51:34,670
Look out, tower.

5619
03:51:35,850 --> 03:51:38,050
Is this where I was supposed to...

5620
03:51:39,650 --> 03:51:40,290
Oh!

5621
03:51:41,290 --> 03:51:41,930
Oh!

5622
03:51:41,930 --> 03:51:42,430
This is a sh...

5623
03:51:42,430 --> 03:51:43,210
Oh, this would...

5624
03:51:43,210 --> 03:51:44,690
This would have been so much easier to kill.

5625
03:51:46,170 --> 03:51:48,290
I could have done it there.

5626
03:51:50,670 --> 03:51:55,290
There's the shortcut that we don't need.

5627
03:51:55,950 --> 03:51:57,770
I could have fucking...

5628
03:51:57,770 --> 03:52:00,510
I could have killed the crow right there.

5629
03:52:03,090 --> 03:52:04,890
Well, I found it now.

5630
03:52:08,070 --> 03:52:08,770
Let's go.

5631
03:52:09,350 --> 03:52:09,790
Whoa.

5632
03:52:10,250 --> 03:52:10,890
Whoa!

5633
03:52:11,930 --> 03:52:12,610
What was that?

5634
03:52:13,670 --> 03:52:14,610
What was...

5635
03:52:14,610 --> 03:52:15,410
Yeah, good question.

5636
03:52:17,850 --> 03:52:18,570
Oh, okay.

5637
03:52:18,650 --> 03:52:18,970
It's gone.

5638
03:52:19,830 --> 03:52:21,470
I thought, you know...

5639
03:52:22,450 --> 03:52:24,850
I legitimately thought that there'd be...

5640
03:52:25,450 --> 03:52:26,190
Oh, shit.

5641
03:52:26,870 --> 03:52:27,390
Okay.

5642
03:52:27,430 --> 03:52:28,810
We should not let you regenerate.

5643
03:52:30,530 --> 03:52:31,210
All right.

5644
03:52:31,330 --> 03:52:32,330
Get over here.

5645
03:52:32,590 --> 03:52:32,990
Phew!

5646
03:52:34,190 --> 03:52:34,910
All right.

5647
03:52:34,910 --> 03:52:35,310
Nice.

5648
03:52:36,450 --> 03:52:36,970
Read.

5649
03:52:37,390 --> 03:52:38,530
I still can't read these.

5650
03:52:38,750 --> 03:52:39,590
Oh, my God.

5651
03:52:39,690 --> 03:52:40,710
What's the point?

5652
03:52:40,810 --> 03:52:41,970
You can't read anything.

5653
03:52:42,650 --> 03:52:43,190
Oh, my God.

5654
03:52:43,190 --> 03:52:44,770
What did your mother taught you?

5655
03:52:45,050 --> 03:52:45,930
I still can't read these.

5656
03:52:50,390 --> 03:52:50,990
All right.

5657
03:52:51,050 --> 03:52:51,390
Read.

5658
03:52:51,610 --> 03:52:52,550
Read this, then.

5659
03:52:52,830 --> 03:52:53,050
Another one.

5660
03:52:54,510 --> 03:52:54,990
Look.

5661
03:52:55,490 --> 03:52:56,730
It's the World Serpent.

5662
03:52:57,570 --> 03:52:59,270
He's so much bigger than I imagined.

5663
03:53:01,510 --> 03:53:02,190
Oh, look.

5664
03:53:02,370 --> 03:53:03,270
He bit Thor.

5665
03:53:04,210 --> 03:53:05,670
Or will bite him.

5666
03:53:06,170 --> 03:53:06,650
Look.

5667
03:53:06,670 --> 03:53:06,770
Oh.

5668
03:53:08,230 --> 03:53:09,550
What the fuck is that?

5669
03:53:09,850 --> 03:53:10,770
That's not Thor.

5670
03:53:11,750 --> 03:53:12,230
That...

5671
03:53:12,230 --> 03:53:12,790
Oh, my God.

5672
03:53:12,790 --> 03:53:13,170
Oh, my God.

5673
03:53:19,950 --> 03:53:22,250
I don't think that's Thor.

5674
03:53:26,050 --> 03:53:27,370
All right.

5675
03:53:28,430 --> 03:53:30,110
Let's see here.

5676
03:53:32,430 --> 03:53:34,810
Maybe the only one big enough to be a son.

5677
03:53:34,910 --> 03:53:36,030
I could have fit.

5678
03:53:38,230 --> 03:53:40,150
Where the fuck is...

5679
03:53:40,150 --> 03:53:41,850
That's not Thor.

5680
03:53:42,230 --> 03:53:42,950
It's...

5681
03:53:42,950 --> 03:53:43,170
Oh, my God.

5682
03:53:43,170 --> 03:53:44,150
This is...

5683
03:53:44,150 --> 03:53:45,650
Where the fuck is this dead?

5684
03:53:46,150 --> 03:53:47,570
Where the fuck is that?

5685
03:53:52,720 --> 03:53:53,640
Let's see.

5686
03:53:54,280 --> 03:53:54,880
Oh.

5687
03:53:54,980 --> 03:53:56,360
We can't do this yet.

5688
03:53:58,100 --> 03:53:58,700
Nope.

5689
03:53:58,700 --> 03:53:59,660
We're not strong enough.

5690
03:54:02,300 --> 03:54:03,240
Let's see.

5691
03:54:05,340 --> 03:54:06,500
What is that?

5692
03:54:06,800 --> 03:54:07,980
It smells awful.

5693
03:54:08,480 --> 03:54:09,600
I don't think we can touch it.

5694
03:54:10,640 --> 03:54:11,880
Can I destroy it?

5695
03:54:12,380 --> 03:54:12,980
Oh.

5696
03:54:13,400 --> 03:54:14,260
I can.

5697
03:54:14,360 --> 03:54:14,800
I can.

5698
03:54:14,820 --> 03:54:15,640
I can.

5699
03:54:15,640 --> 03:54:16,200
New lesson.

5700
03:54:17,700 --> 03:54:18,100
Uh...

5701
03:54:18,100 --> 03:54:19,660
Looks like he had a huge fight.

5702
03:54:19,880 --> 03:54:20,300
Oh, wait.

5703
03:54:20,340 --> 03:54:20,480
No.

5704
03:54:20,640 --> 03:54:21,040
What?

5705
03:54:21,480 --> 03:54:22,080
It's different.

5706
03:54:23,840 --> 03:54:26,440
Journal doesn't say what the journal is supposed to say.

5707
03:54:27,620 --> 03:54:29,520
Assume I can't get that yet.

5708
03:54:29,720 --> 03:54:30,300
And wait.

5709
03:54:31,860 --> 03:54:32,260
Yep.

5710
03:54:32,380 --> 03:54:32,660
Oh.

5711
03:54:32,700 --> 03:54:33,140
I knew it.

5712
03:54:33,620 --> 03:54:34,100
All right.

5713
03:54:34,520 --> 03:54:34,920
Shit.

5714
03:54:35,060 --> 03:54:36,060
That's not what I'm trying to aim for.

5715
03:54:36,700 --> 03:54:37,220
All right.

5716
03:54:37,240 --> 03:54:39,840
We don't get past this until we're back here.

5717
03:54:43,520 --> 03:54:43,920
Whoa.

5718
03:54:44,120 --> 03:54:45,200
There's stuff here, right?

5719
03:54:45,900 --> 03:54:46,460
Oh, no.

5720
03:54:46,460 --> 03:54:47,200
Yo, that's the climb.

5721
03:54:48,540 --> 03:54:50,560
Oh, but there's stuff here though.

5722
03:54:50,980 --> 03:54:52,040
Oh, what?

5723
03:54:52,940 --> 03:54:54,720
Okay, I have to be directly off...

5724
03:54:54,720 --> 03:54:55,460
Oh, shit!

5725
03:54:58,580 --> 03:54:59,960
Is he gonna fight us?

5726
03:55:00,420 --> 03:55:01,580
Oh, he is!

5727
03:55:01,720 --> 03:55:06,130
Oh, what the f- Get back here.

5728
03:55:06,910 --> 03:55:07,650
That's right.

5729
03:55:08,250 --> 03:55:09,030
That's right.

5730
03:55:10,170 --> 03:55:10,910
That's right!

5731
03:55:11,390 --> 03:55:12,190
That's right!

5732
03:55:12,290 --> 03:55:12,750
Get out!

5733
03:55:13,030 --> 03:55:14,250
The worms there.

5734
03:55:15,170 --> 03:55:17,130
They're called Tazel Worms.

5735
03:55:17,130 --> 03:55:19,050
Encounter more of these exotic beasts.

5736
03:55:19,230 --> 03:55:19,430
Okay.

5737
03:55:20,150 --> 03:55:21,450
The Tazel Worms...

5738
03:55:21,450 --> 03:55:21,790
Oh, fuck.

5739
03:55:21,950 --> 03:55:22,730
That's not what I wanna do.

5740
03:55:23,250 --> 03:55:26,470
Alright, open up.

5741
03:55:28,290 --> 03:55:29,470
I can't open...

5742
03:55:29,470 --> 03:55:30,450
What the fuck?

5743
03:55:32,930 --> 03:55:34,670
What kind of lock is that?

5744
03:55:34,790 --> 03:55:36,370
If I can just stab it...

5745
03:55:39,730 --> 03:55:41,410
I like how...

5746
03:55:41,410 --> 03:55:44,390
I like how it...

5747
03:55:44,390 --> 03:55:45,530
doesn't matter?

5748
03:55:45,690 --> 03:55:46,550
And I can just...

5749
03:55:46,550 --> 03:55:47,130
stab it?

5750
03:55:47,450 --> 03:55:50,510
Like, I thought that's pretty funny.

5751
03:55:50,890 --> 03:55:56,370
I was like, what's the point if I can just stab it?

5752
03:56:00,810 --> 03:56:01,370
Oh.

5753
03:56:07,510 --> 03:56:08,070
Wait,

5754
03:56:12,330 --> 03:56:13,270
then where does this go?

5755
03:56:13,390 --> 03:56:14,110
Oh, this is like...

5756
03:56:14,110 --> 03:56:15,930
This is like the other way...

5757
03:56:16,550 --> 03:56:17,810
Is this like the head...

5758
03:56:17,810 --> 03:56:18,570
back here?

5759
03:56:21,170 --> 03:56:22,150
Where does this go?

5760
03:56:24,990 --> 03:56:26,210
I just wanna be sure.

5761
03:56:28,330 --> 03:56:30,290
Okay, yeah, this goes back here.

5762
03:56:30,450 --> 03:56:30,710
Okay.

5763
03:56:31,330 --> 03:56:33,150
I was just curious where this went.

5764
03:56:33,970 --> 03:56:34,450
Alright.

5765
03:56:35,150 --> 03:56:35,630
Okay.

5766
03:56:35,770 --> 03:56:36,490
Now we know.

5767
03:56:37,310 --> 03:56:38,310
Now we know!

5768
03:56:39,470 --> 03:56:40,430
Wonder why...

5769
03:56:40,430 --> 03:56:42,150
Oh, it's a magic knife.

5770
03:56:42,290 --> 03:56:42,570
Okay.

5771
03:56:42,710 --> 03:56:43,610
That makes more sense.

5772
03:56:43,810 --> 03:56:44,410
I was just like...

5773
03:56:44,410 --> 03:56:45,910
What kind of fucking lock is that?

5774
03:56:45,910 --> 03:56:48,230
If I can just stab the lock and it'll be fine.

5775
03:56:50,090 --> 03:56:51,870
I guess because she's like a magi...

5776
03:56:51,870 --> 03:56:54,310
She was a magic person too, so...

5777
03:56:57,000 --> 03:56:57,980
Alright, here we go.

5778
03:56:58,920 --> 03:56:59,480
Alright.

5779
03:57:00,140 --> 03:57:02,220
Give me back my magic axe.

5780
03:57:03,880 --> 03:57:05,140
And then off we go.

5781
03:57:06,600 --> 03:57:07,160
Whoa!

5782
03:57:07,420 --> 03:57:08,800
We discovered...

5783
03:57:08,800 --> 03:57:09,520
Fruit Hills!

5784
03:57:10,300 --> 03:57:10,420
Whoa.

5785
03:57:11,320 --> 03:57:12,720
Sure is foggy here.

5786
03:57:16,240 --> 03:57:16,800
Oh?

5787
03:57:17,160 --> 03:57:17,940
Yeah, come on.

5788
03:57:18,020 --> 03:57:18,140
It's...

5789
03:57:18,840 --> 03:57:19,440
Another door.

5790
03:57:20,260 --> 03:57:21,180
Should we...?

5791
03:57:21,180 --> 03:57:21,300
No.

5792
03:57:21,900 --> 03:57:23,400
It is of no consequence.

5793
03:57:25,700 --> 03:57:26,680
He's a person.

5794
03:57:27,080 --> 03:57:28,860
How did you come by that axe?

5795
03:57:29,180 --> 03:57:30,140
That is my concern.

5796
03:57:30,220 --> 03:57:31,280
Oh, that's his other...

5797
03:57:31,280 --> 03:57:32,420
The Korpo brother!

5798
03:57:33,260 --> 03:57:34,780
I know that blade.

5799
03:57:35,060 --> 03:57:36,620
It was one of ours, but...

5800
03:57:37,300 --> 03:57:38,900
Yeah, he looks Korpo.

5801
03:57:39,220 --> 03:57:39,860
He looks...

5802
03:57:42,080 --> 03:57:43,080
I can't.

5803
03:57:44,400 --> 03:57:45,780
See the woman we made it for.

5804
03:57:45,920 --> 03:57:46,300
I was...

5805
03:57:46,300 --> 03:57:48,320
Well, I am quite fond of her.

5806
03:57:48,320 --> 03:57:55,200
And I would be somewhat displeased if it turns out that you did something to her.

5807
03:57:55,300 --> 03:57:56,680
Wait, why is he in me blue?

5808
03:57:57,720 --> 03:57:59,080
It was my mother's.

5809
03:58:00,340 --> 03:58:02,260
She left it to father before she died.

5810
03:58:06,340 --> 03:58:07,080
Face dead?

5811
03:58:10,000 --> 03:58:11,660
I'm very, very sorry to hear that.

5812
03:58:14,420 --> 03:58:15,660
She was a fierce warrior.

5813
03:58:17,120 --> 03:58:18,100
And a good woman.

5814
03:58:18,360 --> 03:58:18,640
Oh.

5815
03:58:20,500 --> 03:58:21,840
Yeah, I fucked her.

5816
03:58:24,180 --> 03:58:27,840
I will make improvements to the axe.

5817
03:58:30,120 --> 03:58:32,340
But nobody asked you to.

5818
03:58:33,280 --> 03:58:35,300
Well, it's true, but...

5819
03:58:35,300 --> 03:58:43,480
But knowing your mother, she would have insisted I repair that act of vandalism perpetrated against her axe by my...

5820
03:58:43,480 --> 03:58:44,660
Oh.

5821
03:58:45,640 --> 03:58:46,600
I knew it.

5822
03:58:46,600 --> 03:58:47,940
You are Brock's brother.

5823
03:58:48,080 --> 03:58:48,620
I knew it.

5824
03:58:48,620 --> 03:58:50,300
The other half of the brand's here.

5825
03:58:52,480 --> 03:58:54,000
Wait, what kind of upgrade does he do?

5826
03:58:55,980 --> 03:58:57,200
Why is he not blue?

5827
03:58:57,740 --> 03:58:59,080
Though my talents are vastly superior.

5828
03:58:59,900 --> 03:59:00,740
No boast.

5829
03:59:01,900 --> 03:59:02,820
Swear to Freya.

5830
03:59:09,650 --> 03:59:11,250
Do not undo his work.

5831
03:59:11,310 --> 03:59:12,670
Is Freya a giant woman?

5832
03:59:13,690 --> 03:59:15,150
Look at this axe.

5833
03:59:16,010 --> 03:59:17,410
This axe is huge.

5834
03:59:17,410 --> 03:59:20,230
Can you put it down over there?

5835
03:59:20,330 --> 03:59:21,290
That handle is...

5836
03:59:21,290 --> 03:59:21,470
No.

5837
03:59:22,590 --> 03:59:23,230
Filthy.

5838
03:59:25,250 --> 03:59:26,230
Okay, then.

5839
03:59:26,790 --> 03:59:27,870
I'll just...

5840
03:59:28,410 --> 03:59:30,830
I will just...

5841
03:59:32,630 --> 03:59:34,430
God, I wish she was.

5842
03:59:41,710 --> 03:59:43,390
Is that dried blood?

5843
03:59:44,270 --> 03:59:44,950
What are you...

5844
03:59:44,950 --> 03:59:45,650
What are you working on?

5845
03:59:46,510 --> 03:59:46,830
That.

5846
03:59:47,130 --> 03:59:48,610
I call it the Sky Mover.

5847
03:59:49,050 --> 03:59:52,430
Just up that mountain waits a treasure trove of rare resources.

5848
03:59:53,030 --> 03:59:55,730
Once I mine it, I'll need a way to bring it all down.

5849
03:59:56,370 --> 03:59:57,570
And you know how to fix it?

5850
03:59:57,870 --> 03:59:59,070
Not even a little.

5851
04:00:03,820 --> 04:00:05,040
Wait, so what does he do?

5852
04:00:05,200 --> 04:00:06,180
Why is his upgrades different?

5853
04:00:06,780 --> 04:00:06,940
Oh.

5854
04:00:07,140 --> 04:00:08,340
I could use a distraction.

5855
04:00:09,600 --> 04:00:12,400
Resurrection stones giving revived Kratos from death.

5856
04:00:12,900 --> 04:00:15,580
Press to enter to buy the section of the shop.

5857
04:00:15,840 --> 04:00:16,200
Okay.

5858
04:00:17,360 --> 04:00:18,300
Press X.

5859
04:00:20,200 --> 04:00:20,760
Uh...

5860
04:00:20,760 --> 04:00:23,360
Small press 12 while Kratos dies.

5861
04:00:23,440 --> 04:00:23,720
Cells.

5862
04:00:24,460 --> 04:00:27,140
Each is to resurrect him and join only one resurrection.

5863
04:00:27,800 --> 04:00:29,260
If I use it?

5864
04:00:29,940 --> 04:00:31,220
Is it gone forever?

5865
04:00:33,840 --> 04:00:36,500
Or like, is it like one time per...

5866
04:00:36,500 --> 04:00:37,460
per fight?

5867
04:00:37,720 --> 04:00:40,260
Is it gone forever if I use it once?

5868
04:00:41,040 --> 04:00:41,840
Oh, okay.

5869
04:00:41,900 --> 04:00:42,520
Then what's the point?

5870
04:00:43,060 --> 04:00:43,620
Like...

5871
04:00:44,500 --> 04:00:45,400
What's the point?

5872
04:00:45,560 --> 04:00:46,120
Okay.

5873
04:00:46,200 --> 04:00:46,960
Uh...

5874
04:00:46,960 --> 04:00:48,420
Okay, that's the palm...

5875
04:00:49,140 --> 04:00:50,780
I can upgrade it.

5876
04:00:51,420 --> 04:00:52,060
Um...

5877
04:00:52,060 --> 04:00:53,460
It's a consumable.

5878
04:00:53,820 --> 04:00:54,400
I see.

5879
04:00:54,840 --> 04:00:55,960
I can upgrade my axe.

5880
04:00:56,140 --> 04:00:57,340
Still no...

5881
04:00:57,340 --> 04:00:58,220
Talisman.

5882
04:00:59,900 --> 04:01:00,540
Pa...

5883
04:01:01,020 --> 04:01:01,340
Talisman.

5884
04:01:04,380 --> 04:01:06,760
You're still crafting me the same thing.

5885
04:01:06,880 --> 04:01:08,800
So how are you better than my...

5886
04:01:08,800 --> 04:01:09,720
than your brother?

5887
04:01:10,120 --> 04:01:11,400
Yes, my young man.

5888
04:01:12,740 --> 04:01:13,960
Alright, you know what?

5889
04:01:14,940 --> 04:01:16,200
You know what?

5890
04:01:16,240 --> 04:01:16,240
You know what?

5891
04:01:16,640 --> 04:01:19,340
Let's give him a little something.

5892
04:01:19,880 --> 04:01:22,700
One upgrade per area, boy.

5893
04:01:23,060 --> 04:01:25,300
So you get your quiver upgrade now.

5894
04:01:25,500 --> 04:01:26,460
You did it.

5895
04:01:27,540 --> 04:01:30,060
You get to have your quiver upgrade.

5896
04:01:32,760 --> 04:01:34,880
Okay, let's... I want to upgrade.

5897
04:01:36,780 --> 04:01:38,320
Oh, luck of eight?

5898
04:01:38,540 --> 04:01:38,700
Ooh!

5899
04:01:40,500 --> 04:01:41,020
Talisman?

5900
04:01:41,940 --> 04:01:44,140
Wait, I can... Oh wait, never mind.

5901
04:01:44,580 --> 04:01:45,220
What's this?

5902
04:01:45,400 --> 04:01:46,280
Luck of ages?

5903
04:01:47,820 --> 04:01:50,300
Or gain a burst of health?

5904
04:01:51,180 --> 04:01:52,640
Oh, that gives me nothing.

5905
04:01:52,700 --> 04:01:53,120
Sorry.

5906
04:01:53,540 --> 04:01:54,320
Oh wait, no.

5907
04:01:54,340 --> 04:01:54,680
Defense?

5908
04:01:55,640 --> 04:01:56,960
Defense and luck.

5909
04:01:57,740 --> 04:01:59,920
No, defense and luck is good.

5910
04:02:00,060 --> 04:02:03,480
I was going to say I was going to replace it, but I was like, wait, never mind.

5911
04:02:03,560 --> 04:02:04,540
It actually gives me good shit.

5912
04:02:05,540 --> 04:02:06,060
Okay.

5913
04:02:06,060 --> 04:02:07,180
Oh, level two.

5914
04:02:08,160 --> 04:02:09,420
Not enough XP.

5915
04:02:09,760 --> 04:02:10,980
Not enough XP.

5916
04:02:14,040 --> 04:02:15,520
Increase the damage?

5917
04:02:16,220 --> 04:02:16,880
All right.

5918
04:02:18,300 --> 04:02:19,180
All right, guys.

5919
04:02:19,300 --> 04:02:21,040
We're going to call it here.

5920
04:02:21,860 --> 04:02:27,760
I realized I streamed for four hours today, so we're going to call it here.

5921
04:02:29,000 --> 04:02:29,520
Oh!

5922
04:02:30,060 --> 04:02:30,720
Oh, my gosh.

5923
04:02:30,900 --> 04:02:32,540
That was a really good game.

5924
04:02:33,380 --> 04:02:36,480
I really enjoyed it a lot.

5925
04:02:39,640 --> 04:02:40,940
Oh, my gosh.

5926
04:02:41,240 --> 04:02:43,400
Oh, I had a great time.

5927
04:02:43,720 --> 04:02:46,860
It actually has been... it's been a really fun game so far.

5928
04:02:47,160 --> 04:02:55,540
And I'm definitely... I'm definitely looking forward... looking forward to playing more later.

5929
04:02:55,700 --> 04:02:57,860
But I had so much fun.

5930
04:02:58,920 --> 04:03:01,060
Yeah, I really want to finish this in the future.

5931
04:03:01,300 --> 04:03:02,240
I definitely do.

5932
04:03:02,980 --> 04:03:05,280
So we'll definitely have a part two next week.

5933
04:03:06,140 --> 04:03:09,640
But yeah, let me go to yeehaw.

5934
04:03:10,560 --> 04:03:11,080
Yeehaw.

5935
04:03:14,340 --> 04:03:15,760
Oh, my God.

5936
04:03:17,580 --> 04:03:18,540
I'm so tired.

5937
04:03:18,860 --> 04:03:21,000
I didn't realize how long I've been streaming.

5938
04:03:21,180 --> 04:03:22,300
I'm so tired now.

5939
04:03:22,820 --> 04:03:25,700
Let me make sure you're not dead on my screen.

5940
04:03:26,540 --> 04:03:27,100
Yeah.

5941
04:03:30,290 --> 04:03:32,730
I did a little stretching before I call it.

5942
04:03:32,790 --> 04:03:34,230
But thank you, everybody, for coming.

5943
04:03:35,650 --> 04:03:37,450
I really appreciate it, everybody.

5944
04:03:37,710 --> 04:03:40,470
I hope you guys enjoyed watching today.

5945
04:03:40,810 --> 04:03:43,110
Because usually I don't stream for this long.

5946
04:03:43,330 --> 04:03:44,290
So it was really fun.

5947
04:03:46,170 --> 04:03:49,070
It's been really fun playing it so far.

5948
04:03:49,250 --> 04:03:56,790
I definitely enjoyed the story and the gameplay so far.

5949
04:03:56,790 --> 04:03:59,690
I've been enjoying using my axe as a gun.

5950
04:03:59,910 --> 04:04:01,050
It's been very fun.

5951
04:04:03,190 --> 04:04:04,110
I don't know.

5952
04:04:04,210 --> 04:04:05,150
What can I say?

5953
04:04:05,230 --> 04:04:06,850
I enjoyed the ranged combat.

5954
04:04:07,370 --> 04:04:10,850
The ranged combat has been pretty interesting so far.

5955
04:04:14,310 --> 04:04:17,210
But yes, we are going to call it here.

5956
04:04:17,650 --> 04:04:19,590
Tomorrow is my rest day.

5957
04:04:19,710 --> 04:04:24,290
Because I will be at Anime Revolution in Vancouver, Canada.

5958
04:04:24,710 --> 04:04:25,810
I'll be doing a...

5959
04:04:25,810 --> 04:04:28,790
I think a concert and a meet and greet there.

5960
04:04:29,510 --> 04:04:31,490
I think Saturday is the panel.

5961
04:04:32,370 --> 04:04:35,850
But yes, I guess I'll see you guys there if you're coming to Anime Revolution.

5962
04:04:36,590 --> 04:04:41,150
You guys can leave gifts and letters there during the meet and greet and the concert.

5963
04:04:42,230 --> 04:04:44,530
For those who are going there for Mint as well.

5964
04:04:45,010 --> 04:04:48,010
You can leave gifts and letters for Mint as well.

5965
04:04:48,090 --> 04:04:52,890
And they will be sending those over to her at the concert.

5966
04:04:53,130 --> 04:04:55,050
So if you guys have any gifts or letters to Mint.

5967
04:04:55,050 --> 04:04:56,430
I think she's going to tweet about that later.

5968
04:04:56,630 --> 04:04:58,690
We just found out that we could.

5969
04:04:59,170 --> 04:05:00,450
I think like yesterday or today.

5970
04:05:00,670 --> 04:05:02,270
But I think she'll tweet about it.

5971
04:05:03,230 --> 04:05:04,730
Tweet about it later today.

5972
04:05:05,510 --> 04:05:08,630
But yes, you can leave gifts and letters to her as well.

5973
04:05:09,070 --> 04:05:10,010
At the concert.

5974
04:05:10,250 --> 04:05:11,450
But yes, I'm going to call it here everybody.

5975
04:05:11,810 --> 04:05:12,990
Sorry for no after chat.

5976
04:05:13,170 --> 04:05:14,730
I need to rest my voice tomorrow.

5977
04:05:15,210 --> 04:05:16,030
But as always everybody.

5978
04:05:16,230 --> 04:05:16,950
Stay hydrated.

5979
04:05:17,230 --> 04:05:17,710
Posture check.

5980
04:05:17,810 --> 04:05:19,550
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

5981
04:05:19,670 --> 04:05:20,750
And if you stayed up for me.

5982
04:05:20,910 --> 04:05:21,670
Head to bed.

5983
04:05:21,870 --> 04:05:23,370
Because you deserve it.

5984
04:05:23,450 --> 04:05:24,510
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

5985
04:05:24,510 --> 04:05:25,770
Bye guys.

5986
04:05:26,110 --> 04:05:26,570
Bye.
