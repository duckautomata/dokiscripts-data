00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:47,980
Hello!

2
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,220
Hey, Dad's here!

3
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,120
Let me turn on the lo-fi for us.

4
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,620
Let's see...

5
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,660
Whoa!

6
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,980
It's a little too loud for me.

7
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,080
Might not be loud enough for you guys.

8
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,180
Today I feel a little bit... a little comfy today.

9
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,660
Let's see... oh, maybe it is loud for you guys.

10
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,980
Let me double check.

11
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,900
Ooh, okay, let me turn that down a little bit.

12
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,220
Alright.

13
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,180
That should be better.

14
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,000
Alright!

15
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:18,980
Hello!

16
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,860
Why am I short?

17
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,620
Because I want Dad to be here for a little bit.

18
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,600
Um... that's why I'm short.

19
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,520
I just want Dad to be here for a little bit before I kick him away.

20
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,000
Alright, goodbye, Dad.

21
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:33,860
Apparently...

22
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,260
Apparently the dragoons didn't want you here!

23
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,420
Bye!

24
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,000
That's what THEY wanted!

25
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:49,680
No!

26
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,920
I was wrong!

27
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,360
Oh, you want him back?

28
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,320
It's too late.

29
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,560
I kicked him out.

30
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,000
It's too late, dragoons!

31
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,880
You missed... you missed the thing.

32
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,220
You didn't know you missed the thing that you wanted the most.

33
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,780
One guy!

34
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,720
Alright, I was hydrating.

35
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,620
I ordered my new headphones today.

36
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,240
Um, it's gonna be arriving tomorrow.

37
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,180
Uh, I'm feeling a little... I'm feeling very comfy today.

38
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,660
Um, at least just because I'm like really tired, uh, in general.

39
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,120
I think like, uh...

40
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,400
Usually, uh, whenever, uh...

41
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,700
When I'm like in a mindset where I'm like, ooh, the day is over.

42
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,380
My mind just goes straight into like, it's time.

43
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,620
It's almost time to hibernate.

44
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,120
And I'm like, oh, thank God.

45
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,040
And I'm like, I forgot.

46
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:48,980
No, I didn't forget!

47
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,300
Uh, but like, I think like I subconsciously...

48
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,500
Um, subconsciously was like preparing in advance.

49
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,320
Uh, to like, uh, be in like, relax, chill mode.

50
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,300
And, uh, and I'm just like, I'm ready to...

51
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,500
I'm ready for my two rest days, definitely.

52
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,020
I think like this week has been...

53
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,460
This week has definitely been a lot.

54
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,140
This week, uh, a lot of stuff has been going on behind the scenes.

55
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,660
Um, and there's like a lot of things to do.

56
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,160
I think like lately this week, I've been definitely sleeping more.

57
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,640
Because I've been feeling a lot more mentally tired from a lot of work.

58
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,220
Uh, that's been going on behind the scenes.

59
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,940
Um, I'm so sorry.

60
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,040
Uh, I was getting a lot of like, uh, people asking about the whitelist.

61
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,160
We've stopped whitelisting for the last two days.

62
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,060
Because we thought that we would have the server up by now.

63
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,440
Um, so like we were just preparing.

64
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,780
We were just preparing the Minecraft servers.

65
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,700
I'm so sorry for those who are still waiting to be whitelisted.

66
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,660
Um, if by tomorrow we have...

67
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,760
We did not set up...

68
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,960
If by tomorrow we haven't set up the server yet, we're gonna be posting a new way to...

69
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,320
Uh, like a Google form.

70
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,320
If we don't have the server up, we'll be doing like a Google form.

71
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,500
Um, for it.

72
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,160
But we'll see.

73
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,980
There's just so many things going on.

74
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,680
Also, form, thank you for the super chat.

75
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:02,980
Thank you.

76
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:03,620
Thank you.

77
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,840
I'm really sorry for those who are still waiting.

78
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,260
Um, we are still...

79
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,780
There was like a lot of stuff going on.

80
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,700
Uh, behind the scenes at the moment.

81
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,260
But we have stopped whitelisting, I think like two days ago.

82
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,280
Uh, so you haven't been whitelisted yet.

83
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,580
And you're still waiting on it.

84
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,520
Um, you might have to wait a little bit longer.

85
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:27,200
Because we are currently going through some little things in the behind the scenes regarding setting up the Discord server for it.

86
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,040
So I really appreciate your patience, everybody.

87
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,260
Um, and yes, I know I haven't uploaded the new outfit.

88
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,880
The, the, the skin to reveal stuff.

89
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,580
Oh.

90
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,240
That's why I'm looking forward to...

91
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,260
Um, I'm really looking forward to, uh, the next two rest days.

92
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,900
Because I'm pretty sure I'm like...

93
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,200
Right now, I feel like really tired.

94
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,500
Yeah, there's a lot, lot going on at the moment.

95
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,580
So, um, that's why I've been like...

96
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,780
I've been like super, I guess like more tired than usual.

97
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,240
Uh, for this week.

98
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,040
Because I think this week has been a lot that's been going on.

99
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,240
Um, in the backlog for behind the scenes.

100
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:17,260
So, uh, definitely gonna be using, uh, the two rest days to just like catch up on stuff.

101
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,280
As well as, uh, cause like, I know it doesn't seem like it.

102
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,200
Because I do still keep my stream consistent.

103
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,380
Um, so like I try to, I still try to like stream consistently.

104
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,420
Even though I know like there's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes.

105
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,520
Um, I don't wanna sacrifice, I don't, I try not to sacrifice, uh, my stream time.

106
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,820
With you guys, um, and everything.

107
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:44,200
Um, so, uh, like, like on stream, I feel like I got my shit together.

108
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,700
But after...

109
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:54,940
Hahahaha Hahahaha Hahahaha Hahahaha Hahahaha Hahahaha Off stream Doki is a different...

110
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,280
Hahahaha Is a different circumstance.

111
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,960
Hahahaha Hahahaha Hahahaha Hahahaha Um...

112
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,880
Um...

113
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,300
Um...

114
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,380
Yeah, um...

115
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,240
So, uh, I'm really looking forward to the two rest days.

116
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,480
Uh, but I'm glad to just, you know, end the week.

117
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,400

Just to like hang out with all of you guys.

120
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,340
We're like much more comfy, much more relaxed today.

121
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,500
Uh, so I'm just, I just like talking with you guys.

00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,440
You know, just giving you guys little updates and stuff.

And everything.

125
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,300
Um, Eric, thank you for the super chat.

126
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,260
Thank you, thank you.

127
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,860
Uh, today was definitely a day.

128
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,580
Had to run back and forth all over town.

129
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,160
Not fun.

130
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:42,880
Thank you for the super chat.

131
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,800
Thank you, thank you.

132
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,780
Uh, Nexy, thank you for the super chat.

133
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,620
Thank you, thank you.

134
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,840
It's been a, uh, busy week.

135
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,740
Get some rest.

136
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,540
You deserve it too.

137
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,040
Thank you.

138
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:52,660
Thank you for the super chat.

139
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,700
Thank you, thank you, Nexy.

140
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,880
I really, really, really do appreciate it.

141
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,500
Thank you so much.

142
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,960
Um, but yes.

143
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,940
Um, if...

144
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,640
Though, if I do feel tired after the second rest day.

145
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,540
I might take a third rest day in a row.

146
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,680
Just to make sure that...

147
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,540
Because I can feel my brain...

148
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,200
I can feel my brain being very slow.

149
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,600
Like, I could...

150
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:20,600
I could definitely, like, feel, like, the cogs in my brain turning really, really slow at the moment.

151
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,360
So I definitely need to rest.

152
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,680
Oh my god.

153
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,800
Oh my gosh.

154
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,040
Oh, do you know what, like, what I've, uh...

155
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,000
What I've, like, noticed though?

156
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:33,920
Um...

157
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,120
What I've noticed, like, uh...

158
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,780
Recently in the...

159
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,260
In the...

160
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,080
Recently in the coming...

161
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,540
Like, not...

162
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,180
Sorry, I can't word right now.

163
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:48,120
Like I said, my brain has been, like, really, really slow, um, the last couple of days.

164
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:55,180
Um, but, like, what I've noticed, uh, the last couple of months was that I've been, like, super unfiltered.

165
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,280
I...

166
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,340
I literally...

167
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,920
I literally called Pikachu a fat fuck.

168
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,680
I was like, oh my god, I would have never called him that in the past.

169
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,200
I would have been like, he's a chunky little boy.

170
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,720
But I was like, no, he's a fat fuck.

171
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,520
But, like, old...

172
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,160
Like, old Pikachu design.

173
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,160
I... I realized, like, past Doki would have just been like, oh, he's a chunky little boy.

174
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,700
But now I'm like, fat fuck!

175
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,660
And I spoke with, like...

176
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,860
I spoke with so much passion for that.

177
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,720
Um...

178
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:57,260
I realized I've been, like, so unfiltered the last couple of months because, like, I guess, like, you know, when you're in indie, um, I don't have to worry about being, like, super careful about what I'm saying.

179
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,180
And, like, being, like, I guess, like, making sure I don't, like, I guess...

180
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:02,800
Oh, what's the word?

181
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,660
Uh, making sure that...

182
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,800
You know, I don't say...

183
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,560
I made sure that I don't say anything that would, like, offend people too much.

184
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,020
Because I have been, like...

185
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,380
In the past, I'd be like, oh, no.

186
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:19,920
What would Nintendo think if I called their main Pokemon mascot, their main goddamn mascot, a fat fuck?

187
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,580
Well, like, back then, you know, during the 1990s, his original design.

188
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,140
Um...

189
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,060
Like, spon...

190
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:38,760
Sponsored...

191
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,500
Sponsored-friendly.

192
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:41,580
Um...

193
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:49,740
But, honestly, like, I realized, you know, ever since, like, becoming in indie, um...

194
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,460
Um...

195
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

196
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,160
No, Pikachu lost a lot of weight.

197
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,660
No, I...

198
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,300
No, he did.

199
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,600
The reason why I said that was because I was like, oh, yeah, guys.

200
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,220
Pikachu used to be, like, this chunky, now, look at him.

201
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,120
Now, like, every...

202
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,640
Every ten years, he gets skinnier and skinnier, and it's just, like...

203
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,700
Like...

204
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,740
Every every every ten years they keep making him skinnier.

205
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,800
Oh, I was looking up like I was actually looking up like old Pikachu designs.

206
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,760
I was so okay.

207
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,160
I was like, oh my god.

208
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:28,060
They they actually did they just like they just made him like like oh, sorry Well, he's back.

209
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,260
I forgot to...

210
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,920
That's gonna pop in and out.

211
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,740
I love I think this is my favorite.

212
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,200
Okay.

213
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:40,580
I realized I binded I binded dad to the wrong... I binded dad to the wrong place.

214
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,660
So you're gonna see him again really soon like right now.

215
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,660
And he's gonna be gone in three two one

216
00:11:53,820 --> 00:12:00,900
Anyway, I was like looking at like old Pikachu designs and I love somebody made this comparison

217
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:13,040
I love like the progression of like I love it was like 1995 and then like what the fuck happened?

218
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:19,820
2018 he turned into Minecraft Pikachu turned into Minecraft.

219
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:34,640
No, it's I don't know if you guys remember this but this was 2018 was there Was Nintendo's mobile games phase where they made like yeah, it was like blockachu and then like...

220
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,540
They made a...

221
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,940
Well, not Minecraft, but like what's the word?

222
00:12:40,080 --> 00:13:04,040
They made like a like a block version of of Pokemon For like an iPhone game for like an iPhone because there's also an Android before like a phone game the mo Yeah, they had a mobile game Nintendo had a mobile game phase were Were like...

223
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:11,000
They made a bunch of Nintendo games on the phone because it was the next big thing.

224
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:17,700
So one of them was like, what if Pokemon were blocks that were shaped like Minecraft?

225
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:25,180
And also we can merchandise that and make them into off-brand Lego blocks for Pokemon.

226
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,700
And also made them into plushie form too.

227
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:33,660
The thing about Nintendo is that games are not what makes them money now.

228
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,560
It is merchandising.

229
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,600
Not just Nintendo, but like Pokemon.

230
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,160
Pokemon's biggest income is not video games.

231
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:47,540
Because they know people buy whatever fucking Pokemon game comes out.

232
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:47,980
It doesn't matter.

233
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,340
Don't lie to me.

234
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,060
Whatever they make, you guys will buy it.

235
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,360
You see, I broke out of that programming.

236
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,620
I haven't bought a Poke... okay, JK, never mind.

237
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,880
I bought Legends of Arceus because they actually tried a new formula.

238
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,640
But other than that, Legends of Arceus is like their actual... they went out of formula.

239
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,500
But other than that, I didn't buy any other Pokemon game.

240
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,680
I still buy their merch because like I've broken their video game programming.

241
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,680
But I haven't broken their merch programming.

242
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,040
I still buy Pokemon merch.

243
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,180
Because Pokemon...

244
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,240
Pokemon is less of a game company and more of a merchandise company now.

245
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:47,580
So that's why like everything they do is incredibly calculated in a way that like what makes the most...

246
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:53,420
What kind of merchandise would make the most... like what kind of design, what kind of product would make the most money.

247
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,760
Like that Pokemon sleep app they did.

248
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,900
They fucking instantly made merchandise off of it.

249
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,320
Like...

250
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,500
They instantly made like the... what was it?

251
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,120
The sleeping Pokemon merch out of the app that they did.

252
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,360
And people bought that shit.

253
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,020
People as in me.

254
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:20,280
People as in me.

255
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,140
I bought a sleeping Pokemon plushie.

256
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,400
And also Pokemon cards.

257
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:36,160
To be fair, I realized like Pokemon cards, they actually make it much more...

258
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,060
What's the word?

259
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,840
They make it much more... less scal...

260
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,900
They try to make it as less scalpable as possible.

261
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:54,560
Because I know like they like limit people on Pokemon card sales so that kids can actually own the cards as well.

262
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:00,740
So they made it more affordable for... and actually more...

263
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:06,760
Like harder to scalp compared to like other stuff they do.

264
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,280
Because like...

265
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,340
You know, they don't want to...

266
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,220
They try to make sure that it's affordable.

267
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,360
Like you know, it's still a company for children.

268
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,160
Like to appeal to the kids.

269
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,600
So they still want the kids to be able to afford it.

270
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,180
And to be able to experience it.

271
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,780
So that's something that they're really good at doing.

272
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,700
Yeah, you can't buy...

273
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,680
No, you can.

274
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,920
I'm pretty sure you can buy boosters.

275
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,360
Or I guess not like whole box of boosters.

276
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,060
You're just limited.

277
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,540
You're limited to like an amount of packs you can buy.

278
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,220
Brainwash them early?

279
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,380
Yeah, I mean...

280
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,800
Other companies do that.

281
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:03,960
Why do you think like fast food restaurants started to do like play areas?

282
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,480
Like...

283
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,580
It's not a new thing.

284
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,360
Like...

285
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,700
Why do you think like there's play areas in fast food...

286
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,620
In fast food places?

287
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,620
It was to make sure like the children were there.

288
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,660
And like...

289
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,380
And then like toys too.

290
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,040
Like the...

291
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,080
The fast food toys that you get.

292
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,060
I used to...

293
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:26,680
Remember the ones?

294
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,180
The Burger King ones with the...

295
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,800
With the...

296
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,620
The gold Pokemon cards.

297
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,480
And then there were like...

298
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,680
You know, that's where how I got introduced to Neopets.

299
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,480
Because of the...

300
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,200
Because of the toys that they were handing out in like fast food.

301
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,400
But that's what...

302
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,360
That's basically...

303
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,780
It works.

304
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:46,500
Ew.

305
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,560
You think Ronald McDonald was made for adults?

306
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,180
Like...

307
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:54,900
Like...

308
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,120
Like...

309
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,260
It works.

310
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,100
Like...

311
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:03,780
Like...

312
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,400
Anyway, what was I gonna say?

313
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,560
Oh my gosh, I don't know why...

314
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,020
I don't know how I got into the...

315
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,700
Oh yeah, yeah.

316
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,840
The reason why...

317
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,240
I got into...

318
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,560
I got into this tangent...

319
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,120
Was that...

320
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,040
It definitely feels nicer...

321
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,460
To be able to...

322
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:21,900
Like...

323
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,800
You know...

324
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,100
Be able to criticize things.

325
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,540
And...

326
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,140
That was like the whole point of the tangent.

327
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,180
That I can actually like criticize stuff when needed.

328
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,520
And like call out things.

329
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,580
Being able to call things out.

330
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,580
And form opinions on stuff.

331
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,360
Because it's like...

332
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:42,960
You know...

333
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,660
I feel like...

334
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,620
What's so weird?

335
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,020
I keep thinking like what's so weird?

336
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,360
Because I'm trying to like formulate a better way to explain this.

337
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,260
I think it's very healthy to be able to criticize stuff.

338
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,720
Because like...

339
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,580
If you're...

340
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,820
If you don't have any opinions...

341
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,020
If you're always trying to like...

342
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:16,380
Be as PG as possible...

343
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,720
Then I think that's boring.

344
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,820
I think that's really...

345
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,140
Boring of a content creator.

346
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,380
Because like...

347
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:24,760
You know...

348
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,580
The fun thing is always...

349
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,180
You can also like get to banter with your chat.

350
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,960
About different opinions you have.

351
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:29,980
About like...

352
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,080
Like you know...

353
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,100
Because I called like Paramount ugly.

354
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,100
And then you guys were like...

355
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,200
No he's not.

356
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,100
And I'm like...

357
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:36,900
Yeah he is.

358
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,500
He's literally a thumb with wings.

359
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:38,900
And...

360
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,920
Being able to like banter with you guys.

361
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,440
About like...

362
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,040
About stuff.

363
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,820
And like seeing like different opinions on things.

364
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,520
And...

365
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:55,660
But...

366
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,960
Paramount ugly is such a strange take though.

367
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,460
Because he is ugly.

368
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,540
I don't understand.

369
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,780
He's just like a fucking blob.

370
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,180
He's like a potato.

371
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,560
And the eyes aren't even cute as all...

372
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:09,960
At all.

373
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,840
Please don't make me go back into the tangent of how ugly Paramount is.

374
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,940
It's not just...

375
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,240
Okay.

376
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,660
It's not the fact that he has simple design.

377
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,640
There's simple designs that work really well.

378
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,560
But Paramount...

379
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,400
Paramount is not one of them.

380
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,480
It's literally a potato.

381
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,760
It's a giant fucking orange potato.

382
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,200
With like a bat wing stuck on it's head.

383
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,020
It's not...

384
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,600
The eyes aren't even cute at all.

385
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,520
The eyes are like...

386
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,840
Like what's wrong with their eyes?

387
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,360
We got our own opinion.

388
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,120
Anyway...

389
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,880
Yeah but Mama Shiba...

390
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,880
Mama Shiba is different.

391
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,320
Mama Shiba at least...

392
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,380
It's a dog.

393
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,160
It's like a dog peanut.

394
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:58,980
That's different.

395
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,260
Dog beans are different because it's part dog.

396
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,340
And anything that's part dog is good.

397
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,440
You're wrong and that's okay.

398
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,620
And they say fun facts chat.

399
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,520
They...

400
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,560
Mama Shiba...

401
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:28,580
Mama Shiba gives you fun exciting facts that expand your brain.

402
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,760
Okay sorry.

403
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,780
I got...

404
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,240
I can get...

405
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,640
I get way too passionate about this.

406
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,320
Simpson thank you for the super chat.

407
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:41,600
Thank you.

408
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,200
Thank you.

409
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,400
I was like I was gonna say.

410
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,160
But you know it's nice to be able to...

411
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,880
I guess like...

412
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,060
Speak freely on stuff.

413
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,060
Like you know if I don't like something I can be like yeah that sucked.

414
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:55,680
Like...

415
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,740
Yeah I could be like yeah that...

416
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,680
That was...

417
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,200
I could be like yeah I didn't have great time playing...

418
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,900
Doing this part of the game.

419
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,900
Or like yeah this is a poor...

420
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,900
Or this is like you know this is garbage.

421
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:11,680
Like...

422
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,020
This could have been improved on.

423
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,100
So it's nice to be able to...

424
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,320
Um...

425
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,180
Be able to criticize and be able to form opinions.

426
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,340
And like...

427
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:21,940
Um...

428
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,840
You know be...

429
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,740
Be able to express my thoughts.

430
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,720
And I realized like lately I've been like super unfiltered.

431
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,160
Lately.

432
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:37,180
It's usually in the past I have like filtered myself a lot.

433
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,520
Like I have filtered myself a lot in the past.

434
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,340
And I try I always like think about what I'm...

435
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,780
People think that I actually don't think about what I'm saying in the past.

436
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,600
But I actually did.

437
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,600
Um...

438
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,940
I actually try to make sure.

439
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,320
Like I don't say anything.

440
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,800
That was like sort of like a brand risk.

441
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,420
And be like less opinionated on stuff.

442
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,300
Because like when you're part of...

443
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,160
When you're a content creator.

444
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,320
Um...

445
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,340
Um...

446
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:12,640
When...

447
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,580
Uh...

448
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,100
You're...

449
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,880
Well of course I have to still be careful.

450
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:16,860
Of course.

451
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,500
Because like I still want a career.

452
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,540
Um...

453
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,840
I still...

454
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,740
I still want a career.

455
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,700
But I've definitely like...

456
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,900
Definitely loosened it up.

457
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,260
I've loosened up like what I say.

458
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,280
And like what I say to you guys.

459
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,380
And like what my thoughts are on things.

460
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,220
And...

461
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:38,580
But like definitely in the past I have like restricted myself a lot.

462
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,160
To keep like a lot of my thoughts to myself.

463
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,680
When it comes to like oh if I didn't like something I wouldn't say it.

464
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:48,660
I'd just be like oh yeah like if they can approve this.

465
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,080
They should do this instead.

466
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,380
Like um...

467
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:51,820
I did...

468
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,700
They'll be like yeah I did have a good time.

469
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,880
And the inside will be like I didn't have a good time.

470
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,280
But I can't say this game is garbage.

471
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,200
I can't really say this game that's made by a big company was dog shit.

472
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,320
But...

473
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,360
But I'll power through it.

474
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,160
I would insinuate and not say it directly.

475
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:22,680
Um...

476
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,340
Um...

477
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,780
Doc thank you for the super chat.

478
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,560
Thank you thank you.

479
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,580
Dad deserves a good night.

480
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,280
Can we have him back?

481
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,100
Thank you the super chat.

482
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:31,880
Thank you thank you.

483
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,200
Alright.

484
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,260
Here's dad for like two seconds.

485
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,720
Say hello to dad for like two seconds.

486
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:38,800
One...

487
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,240
Two...

488
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:39,780
Goodbye dad.

489
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:40,320
Woo!

490
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,060
It was definitely a video game.

491
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,700
But it's nice.

492
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:52,980
It's nice.

493
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,340
It's nice.

494
00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:00,020
I still try to make sure, you know, I do try to be very careful when it comes to like stuff I say.

495
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,820
Because, you know, I'm still a content creator.

496
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:11,680
And as a content creator, you have like, you know, an image to like, you have an image to keep clean.

497
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:18,140
And you do have to be careful with stuff you can and can't say.

498
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:22,840
And I'm just here to make you guys have fun and laugh, basically.

499
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:31,820
I'm just, I just want to like turn off my brain and just hang out and hang out with my dragoons and just, you know, have fun, laugh and everything.

500
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,180
Um, let's see what else.

501
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,240
Thank you for that one gift and share.

502
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:38,580
Thank you.

503
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,200
Thank you.

504
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,520
Oh my gosh.

505
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,920
You know, like when we were playing, when we were playing Digimon World, I remembered.

506
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,800
I remember.

507
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,100
I remember.

508
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,040
There was like one game I was like, oh my God.

509
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,720
I really want to play Monster Rancher.

510
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,600
I actually, I used to play.

511
00:25:54,980 --> 00:26:00,080
I used to play a lot of Monster Rancher growing up.

512
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,300
But then like my dad also bought the Japanese copy of that.

513
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,620
So I also did not know what I was doing.

514
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:13,060
There's like a habit of that where it was like Monster Rancher 2.

515
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:17,620
I think it was Monster Rancher 2 on the PlayStation 1.

516
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:18,960
Was it 2?

517
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:19,980
It had to be 2.

518
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:27,860
But because I know I saw Monster Rancher 1 and it looked the graphics on that looked like worse than Monster Rancher 2.

519
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,920
I need to make sure.

520
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,140
I think it was 2.

521
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:30,740
Yeah.

522
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,060
Yeah.

523
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:31,320
Yeah.

524
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,380
Also, I love the anime too.

525
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,340
Monster Rancher.

526
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:40,980
Um, but I remember my dad bought me or I don't know if he bought it for himself.

527
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:41,940
I couldn't.

528
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,480
I can't tell.

529
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:49,740
I think he bought it for himself because a lot of the games that I played in the PS1 was like, it was just my dad's hand-me-downs.

530
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,600
So I'm pretty sure.

531
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,580
Anyway, Monster Rancher.

532
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:58,060
For those who don't know what Monster Rancher was, it was basically like Digimon World.

533
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,560
But like the monsters weren't digital.

534
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,580
And they could also talk.

535
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:09,660
So like they weren't Pokemon because like the monsters in Monster Rancher actually die.

536
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,600
They didn't like fake die.

537
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,940
They like die die and they can talk to you.

538
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,620
They didn't have hot monsters in Monster Ranchers.

539
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,200
So there was no rent.

540
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:25,760
So I'm sorry guys, but there was no angel woman or like Angelmon in Monster Rancher.

541
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,400
They were actually monsters.

542
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:40,760
So I think that's why it wasn't as popular as Digimon because they didn't have like they didn't have the Digimon.

543
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,360
Yeah.

544
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,220
What's the point?

545
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,920
It didn't have the Digimon turn into like hot monsters.

546
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,500
Hot, I guess like angels.

547
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,400
So it wasn't as popular as Digimon.

548
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,060
But...

549
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:52,940
Hahahaha.

550
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,880
So...

551
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,700
Hahahaha.

552
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,960
Um...

553
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,700
Um...

554
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,880
So like...

555
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,820
Um...

556
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,640
It was...

557
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,620
It's just like...

558
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,900
It's just a farm for monsters.

559
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,720
And you like raise them and like you fight...

560
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,580
Use them to fight other monsters and everything.

561
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,520
But yeah, I used to...

562
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,280
You train them, you raise them, they can die.

563
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,360
Um...

564
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,100
But I remember playing Monster Rancher 2.

565
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,520
Um...

566
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,660
As a little bird.

567
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,340
And um...

568
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:30,080
I didn't know what's going on because my dad was had the Japanese copy of it.

569
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:30,980
Um...

570
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,040
So like I had no idea what's going on.

571
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,320
So I was just pressing random buttons.

572
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:39,520
But I always love seeing the monsters running around the track and like going into the barn to sleep.

573
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,740
That's all I could remember.

574
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:41,380
I...

575
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,320
Hahahaha.

576
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:43,740
Hahahaha.

577
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,840
That's literally all I can remember from um...

578
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,580
From the game.

579
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,080
But I had a good time.

580
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,700
I had a good time.

581
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,600
Um...

582
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,240
Let's see...

583
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:05,760
Uh...

584
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,460
DarkBlade, thank you for the super chat.

585
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,260
Thank you, thank you.

586
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,560
Hi, Doki and Dragoons.

587
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,960
I'm at a restaurant called...

588
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,720
What the fuck?

589
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,720
Okay, I'm at a restaurant called...

590
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,720
You should get a... burger.

591
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,040
I had a pasta last night.

592
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:32,140
So, I don't want you to eat the same thing as I did.

593
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,000
So you're gonna eat a burger.

594
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,940
Pasta night is my pasta night.

595
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,460
Not your pasta night.

596
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,780
So you should get a burger.

597
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,160
Thank you for the super chat.

598
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:50,620
Thank you.

599
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,240
Thank you.

600
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,240
Thank you.

601
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:53,980
Let's see.

602
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,940
Nexy, thank you for the super chat.

603
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:58,320
Thank you.

604
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:58,880
Thank you.

605
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,620
Are you saying you aren't into any monsters?

606
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,800
Seriously, thank you for the super chat.

607
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,140
Thank you.

608
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,800
Thank you.

609
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,600
That's a wild question to ask me.

610
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:14,980
And unlike goodnight dragoons, like...

611
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:29,520
That's an incredibly wild question to ask me on a supposedly chill lo-fi relaxing stream.

612
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,760
I don't know.

613
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:39,560
I don't think I'm gonna give that answer for just 10 dollars.

614
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,120
Thank you for the super chat.

615
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:44,800
Thank you.

616
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,460
Thank you.

617
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,080
Thank you.

618
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,380
Let's see.

619
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,900
What was I gonna talk about?

620
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,380
I should have a list of topics that I wrote down.

621
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,260
Oh my gosh.

622
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:54,620
Okay.

623
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,280
This is gonna get a little like mushy here.

624
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,520
But like...

625
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,940
I also like...

626
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,600
Um...

627
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
I also like...

628
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,380

629
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,260
Um...

630
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,800
Definitely needed the...

631
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,440
To...

632
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,180
The rest day.

633
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,140
Uh...

634
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:08,580
To...

635
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,100
To rest...

636
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,380
Okay.

637
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,820
This is gonna get a little like...

638
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,920
I'm opening up myself a little bit, guys.

639
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,760
So it's gonna get a little mushy here.

640
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,600
Uh...

641
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,820
So I'm gonna like open myself a little bit.

642
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,740
Like open myself up a little bit.

643
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:20,660
Um...

644
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,200
Oh well, money is the issue.

645
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:22,580
Okay.

646
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,140
Haha!

647
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:23,620
Yes!

648
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:23,840
I...

649
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,320
I...

650
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,560
Read it in!

651
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,880
And then next thing...

652
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,740
Thank you for the akasupa!

653
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,360
Thank you.

654
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,060
Thank you.

655
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,840
Oh well.

656
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,500
Money is the issue.

657
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,200
Hahaha!

658
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:34,300
Haha!

659
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,000
Thank you for the akasupa!

660
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,180
Thank you!

661
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:39,780
Thanks!

662
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,060
See?

663
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:40,920
Hahaha!

664
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,260
Um...

665
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:43,780
Alright.

666
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,900
Before we...

667
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,080
Get on to that.

668
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,040
Um...

669
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,600
Um...

670
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:49,780
Uh...

671
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,400
The only other reason why...

672
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,440
I definitely need to take more rest days...

673
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,840
I had to take a back-to-back rest day.

674
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,520
Was that...

675
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,000
Oh my gosh.

676
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:56,360
Okay.

677
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:56,980
Haha!

678
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,180
Alright.

679
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,500
This is why like...

680
00:31:59,500 --> 00:31:59,860
Okay.

681
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,860
I told my mods.

682
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,660
Because I was like...

683
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,600
My mo- I messaged my mods about it.

684
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,740
Because I was like really worried.

685
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:05,580
Um...

686
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,640
But sometimes...

687
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,100
Okay.

688
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:07,800
I'll let you in.

689
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,560
Okay guys.

690
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,200
We're gonna...

691
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,100
We're gonna...

692
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,020
Oh my god.

693
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:11,780
You guys are gonna be like...

694
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,360
Oh my god.

695
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,580
That's so tsundere.

696
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,240
Like...

697
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,640
Okay.

698
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:14,860
Look.

699
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:16,860
Okay.

700
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:17,860
Um...

701
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,700
The last...

702
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,840
I think like the last like...

703
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,180
Two to three streams...

704
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:21,740
Um...

705
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,260
That I did.

706
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,440
Um...

707
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,460
Last two to three streams I did...

708
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,980
I like messaged my mods.

709
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:28,660
Like...

710
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,140
Uh...

711
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:29,720
Like...

712
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,200
Uh...

713
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,240
One or two of my mods.

714
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,120
And I was like...

715
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,340
Was I too mean?

716
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,240
God!

717
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,820
That is like...

718
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,720
Oh my god.

719
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,220
Guys.

720
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,080
Was I...

721
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,540
Was I too mean to the dragoons?

722
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,080
Like do you think I was too mean to them?

723
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,440
I hope like...

724
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:48,680
I hope like the dragoons know that I was just joking around.

725
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:49,380

Oh man.

729
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,960

730
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,660
Uh...

Joking around.

733
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,100
And I didn't really mean that.

734
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:02,880
Like...

735
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,260

736
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:08,780
They're like...

737
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,560
No, It's okay.

738
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,440
They like that.

739
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:10,940

740
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,420

757
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,560

So, so...

764
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:49,120

765
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,360

771
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:37,140
I don't remember what it was that I don't remember exactly but like the next day I'll be fine I'll be fine the next day But like I was getting to that I'm not always but it was like a two to three street for like the last two to Three streams.

Um...

818
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,430

00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,710
Um... but it's nice.

820
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:59,850
I always like doing these Goodnight Dragoon streams because I can, you know, relax, unwind myself, uh...

821
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:03,730
Just like have like real talk with you guys and like...

00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:11,270
Thank you, thank you.

826
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:12,630
We're being mushy anyway.

827
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:15,630
Today is my first year anniversary of discovering you!

828
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:18,590
Um... I don't even watch VTubers before that.

829
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:19,930
So thanks for the incredible times.

830
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:20,810
Off to another year.

831
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,250
Thank you for the Akasupa.

832
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:23,390
Thank you, thank you.

833
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,830
I really appreciate it, Kaz.

834
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,410
Um... it is actually crazy.

835
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:30,010
I've... I remember like doing the panels.

836
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:33,130
Uh... doing some of the panels at...

837
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:34,670
Uh...

838
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:38,370
Uh... in the various conventions I attended the last couple of months.

839
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:39,290
And...

840
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:43,270
I think like two of them I had like Bark Knights showing up.

841
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:47,470
And it's actually really crazy to see sometimes.

842
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:51,090
Because like there was not a lot of Bark Knights.

843
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:51,710
Like...

844
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:58,630
I... there wasn't a lot of Bark Knights.

845
00:39:59,030 --> 00:39:59,710
So...

846
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:05,010
It's really insane sometimes to like be able to like have some of the like...

847
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:09,390
Uh... like original Bark Knights coming in and being like, oh I...

848
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:11,350
I've watched you all the way since then.

849
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:12,990
Like I'm an OG Bark Knight.

850
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,090
And everything.

851
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:17,030
I don't know if you guys know this but... um...

852
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:19,650
Back then...

853
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:22,790
Uh... during like the Bark Knights time...

854
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,050
Um... I...

855
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:31,770
We would... I would like send like... uh... a lot of the Bark Knights like... um...

856
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:33,290
They... there was a collection.

857
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:34,410
I think it was like...

858
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:37,290
I'm trying to remember how many I printed out.

859
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,090
Um... I got main.

860
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,730
But like... there's one person...

861
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,070
Okay... each month...

862
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:45,090
I think like before like... uh...

863
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:47,270
You know when I first... uh...

864
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,510
Graduated... um...

865
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:53,110
I think like the last six or seven months... for...

866
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:55,430
For six to seven months... um...

867
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:57,370
Each month the top...

868
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:58,870
Was it top ten?

869
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,130
It was like top ten...

870
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:03,290
Um... Donator...

871
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:05,890
Or subscriber... when I used to do Twitch...

872
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:09,810
Uh... when I used to do Twitch streams... so it was easier to track this...

873
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:13,730
And there was not a lot of us... so it was really easy... easy to track this... but it was like...

874
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:15,510
I think it was like five...

875
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,710
Or ten... um...

876
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:19,630
Top ten...

877
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,590
I guess like... Donator...

878
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:23,230
Slash... gifted...

879
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,170
Uh... gifted subs...

880
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:27,970
Would get like... postcards...

881
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,350
Uh... with...

882
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:31,150
Postcards... uh...

883
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:33,390
Uh... being like the top supporter...

884
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,490
Of the month... and...

885
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:37,510
Uh... I remember I would... I'd do stuff like...

886
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:39,470
That... obviously I can't do that anymore...

887
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:41,110
Because there's a lot of us now...

888
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:43,270
But back then...

889
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:45,410
Um... to show my appreciation...

890
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:47,050
Um... because like...

891
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:48,210
Uh...

892
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:51,290
I don't know if you guys know this... but...

893
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:53,570
Um... during the Bark Nights time...

894
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:55,650
Um... even though I had...

895
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:56,210
Like...

896
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:59,330
Like 30... like 20 to 30...

897
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:01,650
Average viewership... um...

898
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:03,850
Obviously like... my average viewership...

899
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,250
Went up a lot because I did like...

900
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:07,430
Partner push... but it was because like... I did a lot of...

901
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:09,990
There was a lot of lurkers... so I did a lot of partner pushes...

902
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,170
Uh... because it took me like...

903
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:13,730
Like...

904
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:15,950
I got rejected like...

905
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,710
Three times... so...

906
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:20,690
So...

907
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:21,710
And you have to wait...

908
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,790
Like... I think like... two months...

909
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:25,810
Or something... to reapply again...

910
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:28,090
It was either... I think it was like one or two months...

911
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:30,010
I don't remember... it was so long ago...

912
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:31,310
Um... but yes...

913
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:33,190

Should I order the big cheese it Crunchwrap Supreme...

956
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:58,930
Or the regular Crunchwrap Supreme from Taco Bell?

957
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:00,710
It's free either way...

958
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:03,650
I don't know...

959
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:04,710
I've never had Taco Bell...

960
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:07,230
Hahahaha... I don't know...

961
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:09,650
Whichever one makes you use the bathroom less...

962
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,770
Because that's the only thing I know about Taco Bell...

963
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:13,110
Um... is that...

964
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:15,090
You... um...

965
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:16,130
Is that...

966
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:19,090
Is that something you eat...

967
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:20,670
Where you have to use the bathroom...

968
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:24,230
Um... so which... I guess like whichever one does it less...

969
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:24,790
Like...

970
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:26,810
Don't do it... it's gross...

971
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:28,450
It's fast food... like...

972
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:31,710
You know what you're getting when you're at fast food restaurants...

973
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:32,570
Like... like...

974
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:35,770
It's not like it's healthy for you...

975
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:36,130
Like...

976
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:38,150
You know what...

977
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:40,810
You know what you are if you're ordering...

978
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:43,010

979
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:43,830

985
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:01,930
I'm looking at my list of stuff I wrote down...

986
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:02,630
I'm looking at my list of stuff I wrote down...

987
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:03,450
Um... oh my gosh...

988
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,650
It was actually really funny...

989
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:06,710
Um...

990
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:08,090
Oh... right after like...

991
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:09,630
The Neopets stream...

992
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:11,090
Right after the Neopets stream...

993
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:13,650
There's like so many things that just popped in my head...

994
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:15,810
And I was like... Oh why didn't I talk about that...

995
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:18,070
Like... I was just like remembering like...

996
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:20,910
The history of Neopets...

997
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:22,510
And... um...

998
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:24,210
And everything...

999
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:26,810
Because I wasted so much of my life...

1000
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:28,350
On that website...

1001
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,690
And... um...

1002
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:31,930
I was like remembering how... uh...

1003
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:34,450
How there was like the underground...

1004
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:36,670
That was funny... I was like talking about like the underground...

1005
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:38,410
Black market for Neopets...

1006
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:40,530
I mean to be fair... there's an underground black market...

1007
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:40,970
For...

1008
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:43,630
A lot of video games...

1009
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:46,810
Um... there's like... I won't be surprised if there's one for like...

1010
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:48,750
Runescape and World of Warcraft...

1011
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:50,770
But... I know that...

1012
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:51,630

So like... I feel like...

1019
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:06,730

1020
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,330
As somebody that's lost...

1021
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:09,670

Um... oh for those who don't know about the...

1026
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:20,410
Neopets black market...

1027
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:22,270
Um... the Neopets...

1028
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:23,930
Black market was basically...

1029
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:26,190
Like any other video game black market...

1030
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:27,590
Uh... similar to the Mercy...

1031
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:29,750
Mercy skin black market...

1032
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:31,610
The pink Mercy skin black market...

1033
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:34,270
Um... at one point in time...

1034
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:36,230
Um... there were pets...

1035
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:38,250
Called the unconverted pets...

1036
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:39,590
Uh... for those who are like...

1037
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:40,730
What do you mean by that?

1038
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:43,990
Um... well unconverted pets are...

1039
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:45,970
Oh... sorry I need to play my lo-fi...

00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,470
Music track again cause...

1041
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:49,470
All the songs are done...

1042
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:51,690
Uh... but basically...

1043
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:52,950
In the...

1044
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:56,050
Back then they did a thing...

1045
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:58,150
Where in the past...

1046
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:00,230
They would use original art...

1047
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:01,870
Uh... they would use like...

1048
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:04,290
Original art for each Neopet...

1049
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:06,310
And because of that...

1050
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:07,850
Uh... each Neopet had...

1051
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:10,470
Each special Neopet had its own like...

1052
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:12,510
Uh... unique pose...

1053
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:13,510
Unique like...

1054
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:16,510
Uh... unique cut... like unique pose...

1055
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:18,350
Unique expressions and everything...

1056
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:19,870
Um... unique artwork...

1057
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:22,170
For basically almost every...

1058
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:24,530
Uh... design and every like...

1059
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:26,110
Pet... but then...

1060
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:27,730
Um... later on...

1061
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:29,370
Uh... when...

1062
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:32,830
Uh... when you know it got owned by different companies...

1063
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:34,390
When like the original creator...

1064
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:36,350
Neopets sold the company...

1065
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:39,070
Um... it went to a group of people...

1066
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:40,570
Who were very...

1067
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:41,730
Into...

1068
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:43,430
Profits...

1069
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:46,530
And into like... it got onto the...

1070
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,950
Public stock market...

1071
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:50,670
So people got really really into...

1072
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:52,690
You know... try to make as much profit...

1073
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:54,250
As they can off of Neopets...

1074
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:56,110
And one of the things they did...

1075
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:57,630
Was that they basically...

1076
00:47:57,630 --> 00:47:59,210
Made it so that...

1077
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:02,610
Um... they changed the art style...

1078
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:03,890
Of Neopets...

1079
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:05,390
To one where every...

1080
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:08,850
Um... every design of a Neopet...

1081
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:10,590
Had a fixed...

1082
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:11,490
Pose...

1083
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:14,430
Um... it had a...

1084
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:15,490
Fixed pose...

1085
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:17,190
And a fixed like...

1086
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:20,450
Um... standard... like a standard default expression...

1087
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:22,050
Because...

1088
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:24,330
They started selling cosmetics...

1089
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:25,950
And called...

1090
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:27,970
Uh... and they opened a thing called...

1091
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:29,670
The Neomall...

1092
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:31,250
And Neocash...

1093
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:33,850
So Neocash was obtained...

1094
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:36,050
By... with real money...

1095
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:37,770
And... and back then...

1096
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:40,590
You don't need to spend real money in Neopets...

1097
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:41,650
It was just...

1098
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:42,930
Neopoints...

1099
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:45,490
And... uh... they...

1100
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:48,570
Did that... so that they could start...

1101
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:50,190
Um... monetizing...

1102
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:51,730
They can start monetizing...

1103
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:54,390
Uh... uh... cosmetics and stuff...

1104
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:55,970
Where you can put like backgrounds...

1105
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:58,650
Buy backgrounds... buy outfits... and everything...

1106
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:00,230
Um... there was much more...

1107
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:01,890
Customization to it...

1108
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:03,950
But... it ended up...

1109
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:06,290
Making the pets really ugly...

1110
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:08,050
Hahahaha...

1111
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,700
Hahahaha...

1112
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:13,860
So... um...

1113
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:16,380
Because of that... they only...

1114
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,560
It only hit...

1115
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,400
The 99%...

1116
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,600
Of Neopets...

1117
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,500
Users...

1118
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:24,540
So...

1119
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:27,660
Because of that...

1120
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:30,760
The 1% of pets...

1121
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,220
Did not get...

1122
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,260
Converted...

1123
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:35,840
Into that... into the...

1124
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,580
Newer art style...

1125
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,380
So... the 1%...

1126
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,100
Of like... Neopets...

1127
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,720
There were like 1%... like...

1128
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,940
Some owners... some Neopet owners...

1129
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:47,400
Will have all their pets converted...

1130
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,160
Or maybe it was like all pets... but one...

1131
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,440
Like... like... cause you can only own 4...

1132
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,100
So like only one of your pet...

1133
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:56,860
Was not converted into that art style...

1134
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,500
So... because of that...

1135
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,740
That started...

1136
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:01,500
The underground...

1137
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:04,480
The underground black market...

1138
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,980
Of people selling...

1139
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,440
Neopets... for...

1140
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,460
Thousands of dollars...

1141
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:12,640
And obviously... the longer the years pass...

1142
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,540
Um...

1143
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,420
The longer the years...

1144
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:17,160
Passed...

1145
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,440
The rarer it got...

1146
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,700
Because sometimes... you know...

1147
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,400
People who own the pet...

1148
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,920
Um... they...

1149
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,760
Their account will get frozen...

1150
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,320
So like that pet was gone forever...

1151
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:30,920
You know...

1152
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:34,420
Like...

1153
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:36,700
It was gone forever...

1154
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,180
So... um...

1155
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:40,520
So like... you know... the really rare pet...

1156
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,380
Never to be seen again...

1157
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:43,620
So some of you guys are like...

1158
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:46,640
Oh... it can't be that much of a big difference...

1159
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,020
Okay... I'm gonna like... let me show you guys...

1160
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:50,840
Like the big differences...

1161
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,020
Between... alright...

1162
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:55,160
The... um...

1163
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,240
Um... the Neopet veteran players...

1164
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,700
Give me an example of like...

1165
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,440
A really beautiful pet...

1166
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:01,660
By...

1167
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,180
The conversion...

1168
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:05,860
Hahaha...

1169
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:08,720
Which...

1170
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,920
Give me an example... like the best example...

1171
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,960
You can think of... that was...

1172
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,160
Oh... the Halloween...

1173
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:15,720
Hahaha...

1174
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:17,780
Hahaha...

1175
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:20,620
Okay... alright... let's see...

1176
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:22,800
I like how everyone's like... Shoryu...

1177
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,060
Hahaha... I don't even remember...

1178
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:27,040
I wasn't a Shoryu... uh... owner...

1179
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,880
I didn't care about Shoryus...

1180
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,320
As much as like others...

1181
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:32,460
Hahaha...

1182
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,660
The Shoryu wasn't that bad...

1183
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:36,160
I don't think...

1184
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,840
I don't think it was as bad as like the others...

1185
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:39,520
Hahaha...

1186
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:42,660
Um... oh my god... everyone...

1187
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,840
Is like Shoryu... I think it...

1188
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,240
I think it wasn't that bad...

1189
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,600
It wasn't as bad...

1190
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:50,120
Hahaha...

1191
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:51,920
Hahaha...

1192
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:54,720
Let's see... um...

1193
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,540
It was less dynamic...

1194
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:58,480
Okay... that's true... cause they're all just standing there...

1195
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,140
In the past they would just like...

1196
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:01,980
They would actually fly... but then they like...

1197
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:05,020
Grounded them so they would just stand there...

1198
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:06,500
Um...

1199
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:07,620
Shoryu...

1200
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:09,320
Hahaha...

1201
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,880
It lost all their dynamic poses... yes I agree with that...

1202
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,160
Alright... let's see...

1203
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,080
Okay... but like a specific one...

1204
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,880
A specific style...

1205
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,540
A specific like... uh...

1206
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:22,180
Okay... I'll give you guys this one...

1207
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,160
Okay... I'll show you guys like what I mean...

1208
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,040
Um... oh the fairy...

1209
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,460
Do you guys remember the fairy Zweetok?

1210
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:29,560
The fairy Zweetok was so pretty...

1211
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,240
Um... alright... I'll show this fairy Zweetok...

1212
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:34,000
Okay... so this is like...

1213
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,660
One of the pets...

1214
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:37,980
Uh... where's the converted one though?

1215
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,620
Okay... the fairy...

1216
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:41,960
Zweetok... oh shit... oops...

1217
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,400
Welcome back dad...

1218
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:45,020
Hahaha...

1219
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:45,680
Hahaha...

1220
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,280
Alright... so...

1221
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,240
Uh...

1222
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,120
Buh buh buh buh buh...

1223
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,860
Alright... this is a good example...

1224
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:57,700
Like...

1225
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,580
Uh... let's see...

1226
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:01,140
Let me clip this...

1227
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,660
Alright... give me a sec...

1228
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:06,000
Dad... we need to make sure you don't keep showing up all of a sudden...

1229
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,460
So I'm gonna disappear for a sec...

1230
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:07,760
Dad!

1231
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:08,280
Wait!

1232
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,160
Hahaha... Dad...

1233
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,300
You can't keep...

1234
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,720
You can't keep showing up...

1235
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,060
Okay dad... okay...

1236
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:19,080
Alright... sorry...

1237
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,680
Um... I closed the door so...

1238
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,780
So he wouldn't keep showing up...

1239
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:24,420
Oh...

1240
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:26,560
Hahaha...

1241
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:28,220
Hahaha...

1242
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:33,720
Don't put him in the bath...

1243
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:34,080
Hahaha...

1244
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:35,060
Hahaha...

1245
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:36,140
Alright...

1246
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:38,280
Let me show you guys...

1247
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,020
What I mean when I say they like...

1248
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,160
Basically...

1249
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:44,800
Changed a lot...

1250
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,660
So... oh there's also this one too...

1251
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:50,260
I guess like... I'll use my mods example too...

1252
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,740
Cause they're very passionate about the Halloween Lupe...

1253
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:53,380
Uh...

1254
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:54,880
Because they're a furry...

1255
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,100
Hahaha...

1256
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:58,720
Hahaha...

1257
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:00,480
Hahaha...

1258
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:02,440
Anyway...

1259
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,460
Hahaha...

1260
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:04,440
Hahaha...

1261
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:07,920
So...

1262
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,060
So like... this is what...

1263
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:13,060
The... I did not...

1264
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:15,600
I did not say anything...

1265
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:16,920
Hahaha...

1266
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:18,080
Okay...

1267
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:21,400
So like... um...

1268
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,080
Alright... let me make sure I grab this picture...

1269
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,920
Real fast... I'm grabbing the picture now guys...

1270
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,320
Um...

1271
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:29,660
Uh...

1272
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:30,980
Alright... let's see...

1273
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:33,120
So they're really passionate specifically...

1274
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,980
About the Halloween Lupe...

1275
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:38,000
Because this is what they...

1276
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,420
Used to look like...

1277
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,240
And... uh...

1278
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,680
Yeah... like... I don't know...

1279
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,120
How else to explain it... but...

1280
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,380
Hahaha... like... literally...

1281
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:49,200
All I can say is...

1282
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,500
Yeah... Hahaha...

1283
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:52,180
Hahaha...

1284
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:52,860
Hahaha...

1285
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,140
Hahaha...

1286
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:55,120
Hahaha...

1287
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:59,820
I can't explain it in any other way...

1288
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:01,440
Like when you see it, you'll be like...

1289
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,760
Oh yeah... Hahaha...

1290
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,660
That's why they're sad that...

1291
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:06,440
Hahaha...

1292
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:09,280
So this is what they looked like before...

1293
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,340
Like this would be unconverted...

1294
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:12,960
And... um...

1295
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,220
The unconverted Halloween...

1296
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:17,160
Uh... Lupe design...

1297
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,640
And then... so... and then after that...

1298
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,100
They converted it...

1299
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,960
And... this is what they looked like...

1300
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,380
After that... so...

1301
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,080
Um... so you know...

1302
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,560
You can tell why... you can tell why...

1303
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,240
You know... they... they...

1304
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,740
Haha... people were really mad...

1305
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:35,100
About this... Hahaha...

1306
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,340
Hahaha...

1307
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:37,660
Hahaha...

1308
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,740
Because... especially because... like...

1309
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:42,660
Um...

1310
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,140
A lot of them...

1311
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:47,520
A lot of them... they stopped...

1312
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,560
What's the word?

1313
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,580
They... it's like... when they used to be...

1314
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:53,500
Like... when they used to be... like... you know...

1315
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:55,540
On... on...

1316
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:57,100
You know... two feet...

1317
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:59,740
They regressed back into being...

1318
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:01,060
Like four feet... so...

1319
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,460
So people got really mad...

1320
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,880
About it... and...

1321
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,020
One of the things... one of the designs...

1322
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:08,920
That got hit the most is...

1323
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,220
The royal paintbrush... because like...

1324
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:13,120
It made the royal pets look...

1325
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,420
Really ugly... in general...

1326
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:17,240
Because people were like...

1327
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,740
What the fuck... like...

1328
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:20,640
Like...

1329
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,440
Who put this Halloween costume on them?

1330
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:25,240
So... I'll give you guys an example...

1331
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,500
So this... used to be called...

1332
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,140
The royal...

1333
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:31,960
Um... the royal...

1334
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,700
Uh... brush...

1335
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,800
The royal boy brush... so if you have a boy...

1336
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,920
Boy Lupe... it would look like this...

1337
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:38,940
So this is...

1338
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:42,280
Um... this is what they would look like...

1339
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,860
And then... after...

1340
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:45,580
After the conversion...

1341
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:47,400
They would look like...

1342
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,260
Uh...

1343
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:50,860
They would look like...

1344
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:51,960
This...

1345
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:55,020
Oh... where's the picture?

1346
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:57,600
Wait... where did it go?

1347
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:00,300
It just...

1348
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:01,740
It just disappeared...

1349
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:02,440
Okay... sorry...

1350
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:04,220
It just disappeared...

1351
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:06,620
Where did it go?

1352
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:08,240
Where did it go?

1353
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:10,440
Oh my god... where did it go?

1354
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:12,980
Okay... transform... reset transformation...

1355
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:14,560
Wait... where the fuck did it go?

1356
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,940
I like... saved it and it disappeared...

1357
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:19,640
Oh my god...

1358
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,940
Oh there it is...

1359
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:23,240
Okay... this is what it looked like...

1360
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:24,240
Sorry...

1361
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:26,960
So... you know... people...

1362
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:29,220
People got really mad...

1363
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:31,000
Oh god... really?

1364
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,320
It converted...

1365
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,360
Oh there was an invisible brush too...

1366
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:36,860
There was...

1367
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,620
Oh... JL... thank you for the super chat...

1368
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:41,340
Thank you for the akasupa... thank you...

1369
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,780
Okay... yeah... I saw there...

1370
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:45,720
The furry bros on this bad conversion...

1371
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,240
Of Lupe...

1372
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:49,920
They just...

1373
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:50,940
You know... it's like they...

1374
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:52,740
They got a dog...

1375
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:55,860
And they gave it a fake beard and everything...

1376
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:56,620
Um...

1377
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,440
So...

1378
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,280
Um...

1379
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:03,240
So that's why people got...

1380
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:06,080
Incredibly mad about this...

1381
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,440
Because you know... they're like...

1382
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,480
I didn't spend millions of neopoins...

1383
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,120
Just to have my...

1384
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:12,280
Fucking...

1385
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:14,460
Majestic...

1386
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:17,220
Royal... royalty dog...

1387
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:19,040
An actual dog...

1388
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,100
I mean...

1389
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:25,860
We have one...

1390
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:26,200
Yes...

1391
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,700
Of course... I'll show you the furry...

1392
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,340
The furry guys...

1393
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,760
Got hit the hardest...

1394
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:32,800
Um... the furry...

1395
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,100
Okay... so you know how I said the...

1396
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:37,800
The grey pets...

1397
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,020
Uh... the grey pets were...

1398
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:42,100
Like... people really loved...

1399
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:43,140
The grey pets...

1400
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:44,800
Because before then...

1401
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,460
The unconverted...

1402
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:48,080
Grey pets... Oh yes...

1403
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,740
Also like all the lupis started making suggestive eyes...

1404
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:52,660
Which made some people uncomfortable...

1405
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:54,100
Um... anyway... because you know...

1406
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:55,720
They're like... literally dogs...

1407
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:57,840
But...

1408
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,220
One of the biggest nerfs...

1409
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:01,940
Was that the grey pets...

1410
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:04,240
The reason why grey pets were like...

1411
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,880
Really really valuable...

1412
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,160
Was because they were one of the most...

1413
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:09,720
Expressive...

1414
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:12,820
Uh... one of the most expressive...

1415
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:14,380
Uh... designs...

1416
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,120
Out there... so... I'll give you guys an example...

1417
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,420
These... the brush...

1418
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:20,720
Used to be very very expensive...

1419
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,880
Because they were like one of the most...

1420
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:23,980
You know... they're depressed...

1421
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:26,860
But like people really thought it was really cute...

1422
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:28,820
Uh... so... but they were like one of the most...

1423
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:29,860
Expressive...

1424
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:32,160
Uh... designs out there...

1425
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,620
So like this is what...

1426
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:36,280
This side bunny would look like before...

1427
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:37,980
And then... and then...

1428
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:41,140
The conversion happened... the great conversion happened...

1429
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:42,000
And...

1430
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:44,220
This is what they...

1431
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:45,180
Went into...

1432
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:48,940
Like...

1433
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:51,620
Now he's just grey...

1434
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:53,560
Like he's not actually sad...

1435
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,760
Like... I can't feel...

1436
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,880
The depression anymore...

1437
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:58,540
Like...

1438
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:04,600
So people got really mad about it...

1439
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,240
Cause they're like...

1440
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,040
Why isn't my pet...

1441
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,820
As depressed as it was before...

1442
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:11,600
So people got like...

1443
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:13,420
People...

1444
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:16,080
People got really mad...

1445
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:16,860
About that...

1446
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:17,680
And...

1447
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,400
Here's like... here's another one...

1448
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,980
Like... um...

1449
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:25,920
Oh my gosh... I'm trying to find one that was like...

01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,360
Biggest examples...

1453
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,420

Um... cause like they all...

1457
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,040
During the great conversion...

1458
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,020
They all basically... it's like the same pose...

1459
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:46,160
It's just... all they change...

1460
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:47,240
Was like the colors...

1461
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,340
So people got really mad about it...

1462
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:50,540
So here's another one...

1463
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:52,840
This is a very sad horse...

1464
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,980
Uh... very sad like...

1465
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:56,980
Unicorn Pegasus...

1466
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:57,920
Um...

1467
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,660
And they're called a...

1468
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:01,580
Uni...

1469
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:04,800
That's like... and then this is what happened...

1470
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,720
During the great... like this is...

1471
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,880
You can tell like... they're really sad...

1472
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,620
They're very very sad...

1473
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:11,020
Um...

1474
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:15,300
And then...

1475
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:17,960
Um... this is what they did...

1476
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:19,240
Now...

1477
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:22,000
They're just you know... they got something in their eye...

1478
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:22,620
Like...

1479
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:26,020
Like you can feel the depression...

1480
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:27,840
Here... um...

1481
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:29,840
Where... where you know... like...

1482
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:32,280
The... the horse...

1483
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,680
You know... hasn't really taken a shower...

1484
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:35,960
In a couple of days...

1485
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:38,420
Um... their hair is a mess...

1486
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:39,860
And then this guy...

1487
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:42,300
On the top during the great conversion...

1488
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:43,340
Um...

1489
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:46,160
You know... they just... they got...

1490
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:47,080
Something in their eye...

1491
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,460
Like they got something...

1492
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:53,120
And...

1493
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,120
Um...

1494
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,040
That's why...

1495
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:58,480
There was an underground...

1496
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,460
There was an...

1497
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:02,660
Underground black market...

1498
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:03,360
For...

1499
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:04,660
Mealpets...

1500
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:07,440
And people were selling these guys...

1501
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:08,760
Like especially these guys...

1502
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:11,340
For like thousands of dollars...

1503
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:13,000
In like real money...

1504
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,040
Because they're like...

1505
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,440
Because these guys were like super rare to get...

1506
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,980
And they're like super expressive and everything...

1507
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:21,140
Yeah... like the details were just all gone...

1508
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:21,720
And stuff...

1509
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:23,500
Oh my god...

1510
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:26,460
Speaking of... like... it was actually crazy...

1511
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:28,080
I was looking through like...

1512
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,020
Um... I was looking through the new colors...

1513
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:31,540
That they have in Mealpets...

1514
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:33,160
Did you know there's like the elder...

1515
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:36,740
You can like make your pets old now...

1516
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:38,240
Which I was...

1517
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:39,460
I was...

1518
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:41,660
I was so surprised...

1519
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:42,640
About...

1520
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:45,620
Um... because like... I did not realize...

1521
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:46,540
Like... what...

1522
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:48,660
I don't know... I'm just...

1523
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:51,780
I guess like the roleplay will go super hard...

1524
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:52,180
But...

1525
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,060
I'm like here thinking...

1526
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:57,780
Why would I want to make my pet old...

1527
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:58,240
Like...

1528
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:02,300
There's...

1529
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:03,700
There's like an old...

1530
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:04,940
Okay... I need to show you guys...

1531
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:06,580
Because I thought it was really funny...

1532
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:08,180
When like... I thought...

1533
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:11,220
It was so funny...

1534
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:12,780
I didn't realize it was a real thing...

1535
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:14,700
Um... but this is...

1536
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:17,300
This is like one of their newest...

1537
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,160
Brushes...

1538
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,160
Which is like an old...

1539
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:23,460
So you can make your pet fucking old...

1540
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,140
Sorry... it's so funny...

1541
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:29,940
I thought it was so funny...

1542
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:30,860
I'm like... why?

1543
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:37,340
Um... but yes...

1544
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:39,420
You can turn your Mealpet...

1545
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:40,600
Into like...

1546
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,600
I guess your grandpa...

1547
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,380
Oh wait... there's like...

1548
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:46,380
Okay... let me see if there's...

1549
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:47,560
Let me look through these...

1550
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,000
I need to look through the...

1551
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:51,760
I'm gonna look through these...

1552
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,420
Oh my gosh... this one's funny...

1553
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:55,500
There's like... this one...

1554
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,180
I'm just... I don't know...

1555
01:03:57,180 --> 01:04:00,240
I don't know what to say...

1556
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:03,180
Like... I... I... I don't know...

1557
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:04,400
Oh yeah... and then...

1558
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,140
Okay...

1559
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:06,940
You can even like...

1560
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:08,380
Take off their clothes...

1561
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:10,480
Because like... I don't know...

1562
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,320
And I don't know why... but like... you can also take off their clothes...

1563
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:15,060
So like... this is like...

1564
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,760
What one... this is them...

1565
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,560
Clothes... but then like...

1566
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:19,800
Because they're wearing glasses... right?

1567
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:22,780
But then obviously you can take off their clothes...

1568
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:24,480
But it was... it's only like...

1569
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,800
The thing is... it's like only their...

1570
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,980
Their... their face...

1571
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:31,020
That's old... and that's it...

1572
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:32,640
So here's like an example...

1573
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,260
Like here's like what it looks like...

1574
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:35,780
But it's only their face...

1575
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:38,320
Like... I don't understand...

1576
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:39,880
Like...

1577
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:42,620
I... I... I guess...

1578
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:44,420
Like... let me try like...

1579
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:46,420
Maybe I'll take off clothes for the other ones...

1580
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:49,080
Okay sorry... the context for this is really bad...

1581
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,840
Um... but I just wanna know like...

1582
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,940
What... what it would look like...

1583
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:54,160
I... I guess...

1584
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,740
Like... there's wrinkles on them...

1585
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:57,640
Um...

1586
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:01,100
But like... I don't really see...

1587
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:02,160
Like...

1588
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,100
What the difference really is...

1589
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:05,520
Other than the face...

1590
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:07,620
No!

1591
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:10,120
Don't take off their clothes!

1592
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:12,620
Oh!

1593
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:14,860
There's like... okay there's one for like...

1594
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:16,900
The female version of it too...

1595
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:18,780
Wait let me show you guys the female version...

1596
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,220
Don't worry...

1597
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:22,820
I didn't take off... I didn't take off the clothes...

1598
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:25,600
I just wanna show you guys the female version of it...

1599
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,600
This is the female version of a Pateri...

1600
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:30,600
Look!

1601
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:31,580
There's Granny!

1602
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,500
That's gonna be...

1603
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,380
That's gonna be us one day...

1604
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:36,700
That's gonna be me!

1605
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,320
But there's like...

1606
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:44,160
The elderly brush too...

1607
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:44,880
Um...

1608
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:46,800
Anyway...

1609
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,260
The Neopets rabbit hole...

1610
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:49,660
Goes really deep guys...

1611
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:50,600
It really does...

1612
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:54,460
I was rewatching the Neopets VOD too...

1613
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:56,260
And like... I didn't even realize...

1614
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:57,320
There's a memorial?

1615
01:05:57,980 --> 01:06:00,980
I was like... I was looking through the VOD...

1616
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:02,400
And I realized they added like...

1617
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,140
New things on the map...

1618
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:05,740
And I was like... Wait there's a memorial...

1619
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:07,580
Like I saw this...

1620
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:10,940
I saw this... Why is there a war memorial?

1621
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:12,700
Like...

1622
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:14,240
Hahahaha...

1623
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:16,340
Why?

1624
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:19,120
Hahahaha...

1625
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:22,100
Why is there a war memorial...

1626
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,380
In my Neopets game?

1627
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:25,960
Do you know what this...

1628
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,380
Okay... Do you know what it looked like before?

1629
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:30,960
This is what Neopets...

1630
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:32,160
Looked like before...

1631
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,480
That's why I was freaking out...

1632
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:35,660
I was like... Who told them to civilize?

1633
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:37,520
Like... Hahahaha...

1634
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:40,240
They used to have no houses...

1635
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,520
They lived in caves...

1636
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:43,900
So I was like...

1637
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:47,060
I was just like... Who taught them how to build a bridge?

1638
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:48,940
Hahahaha...

1639
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:49,720
Hahahaha...

1640
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:53,040
What happened to my prehistoric lands?

1641
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:54,900
What happened?

1642
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:56,240
Anyway...

1643
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,340
Like I said... Neopets actually...

1644
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:00,440
In the story of Neopets...

1645
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:01,500
They...

1646
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:05,000
They actually...

1647
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,780
They can actually...

1648
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:08,120
Die...

1649
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:10,620
So that's why there's a war memorial...

1650
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:11,540
And then...

1651
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,520
This is what it looked like before...

1652
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:16,400
So I was just like... Oh my god...

1653
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:17,720
They fucking...

1654
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:20,200
They learned how to build infrastructure...

1655
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:23,220
Who taught these cavemen...

1656
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:24,620
How to build infrastructure?

1657
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:26,500
Hahahaha...

1658
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,820
Soon they're gonna evolve...

1659
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:30,760
And learn how to drive cars...

1660
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,400
They're not gonna be the priest...

1661
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,100
What was the point of painting them in the pure historic era...

1662
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:38,140
If they were just gonna evolve anyway...

1663
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:38,500
Like...

1664
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:39,740
There's a reason why...

1665
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:42,220
I kept them in this era...

1666
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:45,480
Hahahaha...

1667
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:48,760
Oh...

1668
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:49,700
Sorry...

1669
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:50,980
Moving on...

1670
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:52,320
Moving on from Neopets...

1671
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:53,980
I wanna talk about something else...

1672
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:57,740
I never told you guys about this...

1673
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:58,500
But like...

1674
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:01,460
I actually really like Monster High...

1675
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:03,440
For those who are like...

1676
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:04,720
What the fuck is Monster High?

1677
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,820
I don't like the dolls...

1678
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:09,180
I don't give a fuck about the dolls...

1679
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:10,660
I just really like the show...

1680
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:11,560
And the lore...

1681
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:14,560
I don't know if I've ever confessed that before...

1682
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:15,840
But like...

1683
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:17,920
I actually... unironically...

1684
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,520
Watched Monster High show...

1685
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:21,680
The Monster High show...

1686
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,860
Not the newest one...

1687
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:24,860
The newest one sucks...

1688
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:27,420
And the movies... The movies suck...

1689
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:30,700
But I used to watch the old style...

1690
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:32,340
The original OG...

1691
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:33,720
Monster High style...

1692
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:36,620
And like... um... Ever After High...

1693
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:38,100
I really liked Ever After High...

1694
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:39,300
Ever After High...

1695
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:40,980
Before they put it on...

1696
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,000
Hiatus Forever...

1697
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,080
Because it was not as popular as Monster High...

1698
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,440
But I actually...

1699
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:49,880
I actually used to watch Monster High...

1700
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,060
And I really enjoyed it...

1701
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,840
I don't care about the dolls...

1702
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,500
Because like... I know that...

1703
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,740
People... uh... what was it?

1704
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:57,080
Mattel?

1705
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,720
I feel like it's always Mattel...

1706
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:02,940
Hahahaha...

1707
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:04,580
Hahahaha...

1708
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:06,400
Um...

1709
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:07,640
Um...

1710
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:09,860
Um...

1711
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:11,060
But I...

1712
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:13,860
I used to...

1713
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:16,800
I used to watch the show a lot...

1714
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,800
And also like the 3D animated movies...

1715
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,520
Before they went with the newest style...

1716
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:21,860
And um...

1717
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:23,140
I really enjoyed it...

1718
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:24,200
Oh it's Hasbro?

1719
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,080
It was either Mattel or Hasbro...

1720
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,460
I could never remember...

1721
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:29,680
It... because like...

1722
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,340
Because like you know...

1723
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:34,300
It's always like ran by the two...

1724
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:35,960
Doll companies...

1725
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:38,080
And it's either Mattel or Hasbro...

1726
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,340
But obviously like their main goal...

1727
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:41,820
Is to make...

1728
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:43,420
Merchandise...

1729
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:45,160
Is to make shows...

1730
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:47,760
To make shows...

1731
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:50,040
To sell merch...

1732
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:52,520
It doesn't matter how well the show...

1733
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:53,240
Does...

1734
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:56,820
As long as people buy the dolls...

1735
01:09:56,820 --> 01:09:58,160
That's all that matters...

1736
01:09:58,500 --> 01:09:59,320
The thing is...

1737
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:02,480
I feel like Monster High...

1738
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,540
Like the creators...

1739
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:05,560
Of Monster High...

1740
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:07,180
Mattel...

1741
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:09,140
Or Monster High...

1742
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:10,840
I feel like...

1743
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:13,800
They didn't realize...

1744
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:16,140
That the reason why a lot of people...

1745
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:17,940
Bought Monster High dolls...

1746
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:19,920
Was that they were really good...

1747
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,680
For doll customization...

1748
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:24,200
So people bought a lot of...

1749
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:25,740
Monster High dolls...

1750
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:27,760
Just to customize them...

1751
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:29,020
Because they...

1752
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:30,480
Want the dolls...

1753
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:35,000
Because apparently...

1754
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,580
Monster High dolls...

1755
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:37,860
Were like the easiest...

1756
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:39,700
To customize dolls with...

1757
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:41,420
I don't remember the reason why...

1758
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:43,260
But I have a guilty pleasure...

1759
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:46,440
Of watching doll customization videos...

1760
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:47,820
And um...

1761
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:49,820
And like...

1762
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:51,980
They always used Monster High dolls...

1763
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:53,600
Because they always had the best...

1764
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,920
I guess like the best mold...

1765
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,140
For customization...

1766
01:10:58,620 --> 01:10:59,500
And...

1767
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:01,060
I miss Monster High...

1768
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:02,820
I love that show...

1769
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:03,800
That was such a good show...

1770
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:04,840
Also Ever After...

1771
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,620
Oh my gosh...

1772
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:11,080
I wish they didn't reboot it...

1773
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:12,000
I don't know...

1774
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,320
I really like the style...

1775
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:15,880
Oh my god...

1776
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:19,860
My Vtuber is a girl...

1777
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:21,780
Hahahaha...

1778
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:23,600
Hahahaha...

1779
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:25,300
Hahahaha...

1780
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:26,800
Hahahaha...

1781
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:29,020
Anyway...

1782
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,660
It was so...

1783
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:34,820
It was so iconic...

1784
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:36,560
Hahahaha...

1785
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:37,880
Hahahaha...

1786
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:38,920
No way...

1787
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:40,600
Hahahaha...

1788
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:43,340
Was I ever into Bratz...

1789
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:44,840
I was never into dolls...

1790
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,340
I was never into like...

1791
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:48,260

Hahahaha...

1794
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:54,260
Hahahaha...

Uh...

01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:29,700
Fuck... What was I on?

1811
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:32,900
What was I on before I got distracted there?

1812
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:34,220
Oh yeah...

1813
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:35,260
I wasn't into dolls...

1814
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:36,540
I was not into like...

1815
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:39,720
Dolls in general...

1816
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:41,140
I honestly...

1817
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:44,800
The closest to dolls that I liked...

1818
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:45,400
Like you know...

1819
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:48,300
Like actual dolls was Littlest Pet Shop...

1820
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:50,560
Littlest Pet Shop that's you...

1821
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:51,220
Wooo...

1822
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:53,260
I used to have...

1823
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:57,840
I used to buy a shitload of Littlest Pet Shop figures...

1824
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:58,480
I used to buy a shitload of Littlest Pet Shop figures...

1825
01:12:58,500 --> 01:12:59,360
Like I had like the...

1826
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:01,700
The big, giant, Littlest Pet Shop...

1827
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:02,560
Um...

1828
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,800
A grooming station...

1829
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,180
Um... With like you know the pet shop...

1830
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:08,060
Where like you can like...

1831
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:10,260
Uh... Bathe the pets and everything...

1832
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:11,760
And I would buy like specific...

1833
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,300
Like I wouldn't even buy like sets...

1834
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:15,340
I would also buy like specific...

1835
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:17,160
Like pets as well...

1836
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:17,740
I'll be like...

1837
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:20,620
Oh that's a rare one... It says it's a rare one...

1838
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:21,800
I want it...

1839
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:24,280
And I would buy like a lot of the Littlest Pet Shop...

1840
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:25,220
Um...

1841
01:13:25,220 --> 01:13:26,820
The Littlest Pet Shop...

1842
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:28,780
Figures and everything...

1843
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:31,520
I think that was like the closest to like figures...

1844
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:32,560
Like not figures... Sorry...

1845
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,660
The closest to like dolls I ever had...

1846
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:36,220
I'm trying to remember if I had like other dolls...

1847
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:37,240
But I don't think I did...

1848
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:41,460
I just had like... I just really played with Littlest Pet Shop...

1849
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:43,100
I played with Littlest Pet Shop...

1850
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,220
Um... Or like video games...

1851
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:47,000
Cause like... I was like...

1852
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,140
Why the fuck would I play with dolls when I can play video games...

1853
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:50,860
You know... Like...

1854
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,140
That was my... That was my mindset...

1855
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:55,380
As like... Like...

1856
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:57,400
As a child... I was like... Why?

1857
01:13:57,980 --> 01:13:58,660
Hahaha...

1858
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:01,900
I don't need to use...

1859
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:03,440
My imagination...

1860
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:06,020
If I had video games...

1861
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:06,300
Like...

1862
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:07,900
So...

1863
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:10,280
So...

1864
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:13,560
I like never really had like...

1865
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:15,300
Like toys...

1866
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:16,860
I guess like I did have toys...

1867
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:19,840
Like I... You know... Like interactive toys...

1868
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,360
Like... Um...

1869
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:24,580
I had interactive toys...

1870
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:25,540
That was like...

1871
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:27,180
Supposed to like help with like...

1872
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:29,540
Electronics and stuff... Like there's like one that like...

1873
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:31,440
The leapfrog thing where like...

1874
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:34,140
It was a book that teaches reading...

1875
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:35,660
And stuff... Um...

1876
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:38,100
So you can like get a pen and then like...

1877
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:39,960
Like go over words and stuff...

1878
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:42,100
And it'll be like... This is how to learn to read...

1879
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:43,740
And stuff like that... But like...

1880
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:45,800
I don't think I ever like... I rarely ever...

1881
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,380
Physically played with toys...

1882
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:50,340
Um... It was mostly just like...

1883
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:52,320
Video games like Game Boys...

1884
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:53,860
DS...

1885
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:56,440
Uh... Game Boy Advance...

1886
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:58,340
Consoles like PlayStation 1...

1887
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:00,840
Um... PlayStation 2...

1888
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:02,360
Uh... No Xbox...

1889
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:03,960
Cause I said my dad hated...

1890
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:05,880
Um... Xboxes...

1891
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,140
Um... He only bought... I told you guys...

1892
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:09,640
He only bought Xbox once...

1893
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:11,760
And it was for the 360...

1894
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:14,220
For some exclusive shit... I don't remember what...

1895
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:16,560
Exclusive was there for on the 360...

1896
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,460
That made him buy an Xbox...

1897
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:18,760
Oh!

1898
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:19,300
Gears of War!

1899
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:22,360
Um... Gears of War was...

1900
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,840
Exclusive on the Xbox...

1901
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:26,700
And then so it was like... On the Xbox 360...

1902
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:28,360
So it was the only time...

1903
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:30,340
He's ever owned an Xbox 360...

1904
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,280
Speaking of Xbox...

1905
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:34,590
The Xbox has the fucking worst naming convention...

1906
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:35,880
I've ever seen...

1907
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:37,600
For a console... Like...

1908
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:40,060
The newest Xbox is called what?

1909
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:41,400
The Xbox One S?

1910
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:41,900
Like...

1911
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:43,380
What... What does that mean?

1912
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:43,860
Like...

1913
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:47,380
It has...

1914
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:49,400
It has such a fucking...

1915
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:51,980
A fucking terrible naming convention...

1916
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:53,280
Like... I... I...

1917
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:53,960
Why?

1918
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:57,380
Why is it... The newest one?

1919
01:15:57,700 --> 01:15:59,620
Is it like... Xbox...

1920
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:01,720
I need to pull it up... I was like reading it...

1921
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:02,980
And I was like... They released...

1922
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:06,540
They released a new... New generation of Xbox...

1923
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:07,800
And it's like... Xbox...

1924
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:09,500
What... Like...

1925
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:10,320
What was it?

1926
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:10,980
S?

1927
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:13,740
The series SXS one?

1928
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:16,480
Okay... Xbox console...

1929
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:17,980
Names...

1930
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:20,120
Okay...

1931
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:22,580
The Xbox series S... Okay...

1932
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:24,760
Okay... I'll show you guys...

1933
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:25,980
Why I think like...

1934
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:27,780
The Xbox has one of the...

1935
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:29,300
One of the...

1936
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:31,260
The worst naming...

1937
01:16:34,780 --> 01:16:36,200
One of the...

1938
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:37,760
Worst fucking...

1939
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:40,520
Series of names I've ever seen...

1940
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:41,360
For anything...

1941
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:44,360
The Xbox series...

1942
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:47,040
For those who don't know...

1943
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,740
This is like...

1944
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:50,320
So...

1945
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:52,640
There's the original Xbox...

1946
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,820
The Xbox 360...

1947
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:56,540
The Xbox 360 core...

1948
01:16:56,940 --> 01:16:58,440
The Xbox 360 elite...

1949
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:00,420
The Xbox 360 arcade...

1950
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:02,000
The Xbox 360 S...

1951
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,220
Xbox 360 E...

1952
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:04,220
Xbox One...

1953
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:06,020
Xbox One Elite...

1954
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:07,280
Xbox One S...

1955
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:10,360
Xbox X... One X...

1956
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:13,460
And then the Xbox One S...

1957
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:15,020
All digital edition...

1958
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:15,660
And then...

1959
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:19,280
Xbox... I don't know what this is... What is this one?

1960
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:21,900
What is the newest one?

1961
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:28,480
So...

1962
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,640
I never understand...

1963
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:31,840
I never...

1964
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,660
I never understand...

1965
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,240
Xbox... The Xbox Series X...

1966
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:37,740
Oh yes!

1967
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:38,860
Sorry...

1968
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:41,380
That's the Xbox Series X...

1969
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:42,400
So...

1970
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:43,960
Like... How?

1971
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:51,240
I'm like... How do you keep...

1972
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:52,280
Keep up with that?

1973
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:52,820
Like...

1974
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:56,100
How... How do you keep up with that?

1975
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:57,580
How do you keep up with that?

1976
01:17:58,360 --> 01:17:59,620
At least like...

1977
01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:01,140
You know... PlayStation 1...

1978
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:02,440
PlayStation 2...

1979
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:03,880
PlayStation 3...

1980
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:06,020
PlayStation 4...

1981
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:09,200
And finally... PlayStation 5...

1982
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:10,960
How the fuck am I supposed to remember...

1983
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,680
Xbox Series 1 X?

1984
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:13,620
Like... How?

1985
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:17,780
Um...

1986
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:19,000
Um...

1987
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:19,720
Um...

1988
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:23,020
At least like... At least Nintendo...

1989
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:24,020
They had like...

1990
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:25,380
The Wii U...

1991
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:27,360
And then like... The Wii...

1992
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:29,800
And then the Wii U...

1993
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:32,200
You know... And then they scrapped the whole thing...

1994
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,820
And was like... We're making a new console...

1995
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:34,780
The Switch...

1996
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:37,240
I hope they make a new Switch...

1997
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:41,100
I hope... Because if they make a new Switch...

1998
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:43,440
That means there's potentially...

1999
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,440
They'll finally fix...

2000
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:46,300
The...

2001
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:48,720
They'll finally fix the...

2002
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:49,900
The sticks...

2003
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:50,340

2039
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,420

2056
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:32,200
Naming conventions...

This is basically...

2087
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,000
Like... The Xbox...

2088
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,960

Uh... Let me show you guys...

2100
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,680

2101
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,460
Titles were... For them...

2102
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:03,060
Um... I showed this before...

2103
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:05,020

It's one of my...

2107
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:13,920
It's one of my favorite things about the Fast and Furious...

2108
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:14,960
Uh... Movie...

2109
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:17,260
Franchise... So... This is like...

2110
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:18,800
The Japanese...

2111
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,580
Titles... Of it...

2112
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:22,460
So... You can see they called it...

2113
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:24,980
Wild Speed... Wild Speed X2...

2114
01:22:24,980 --> 01:22:27,240
Wild Speed X3... Wild Speed Max...

2115
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:28,940

01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:30,560

Wild Speed Ice Break...

2119
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,860
Wild Speed Super Combo...

2120
01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:38,780
So you know... They didn't care about the...

2121
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:40,300
Hobbs and Shaw thing... They went...

2122
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:42,720
Wild Speed Super Combo... Um...

2123
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:44,420
And then Wild Speed Jet Break...

2124
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:46,280
Hahaha...

2125
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:47,840
Hahaha...

2126
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:49,520
Hahaha...

2127
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:51,300
So...

2128
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:55,020
Um... At least they kept it...

2129
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:57,280
Consistent... You know... The Wild Speed...

2130
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,580
At least...

2131
01:22:58,580 --> 01:23:00,200
At least...

2132
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:03,240
That was consistent... So this was like...

2133
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,720
The titles of it...

2134
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:06,740
In Japan... Um...

2135
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:09,140
And... This just reminded...

2136
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:10,840
Me of X... Like... Xbox...

2137
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:13,000
Reminded me of this... Cause like... Fast and Furious...

Had like... I don't know...

2139
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:16,820
They just throw some words in there...

2140
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:17,660
And then... Hahaha...

2141
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:21,200
They just... You know... Throw some words...

2142
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:23,280
In there... Hahaha...

2143
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:25,060
Um...

2144
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:26,180
Uh...

2145
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:28,560
Let's see...

2146
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:29,680
Ah...

Thank you so much...

2150
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,800
Oh... I saw somebody earlier... Asking about...

2151
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,960
My opinion on the game... And...

2152
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:43,020
Uh... Uh... They wanted me to...

2153
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:45,020
Answer it... So... Influx... Thank you...

2154
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,040
In the super chat... Influx... Thank you... Thank you...

2155
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:49,420
Thank you... Hey Toki... Speaking of your dad...

2156
01:23:49,420 --> 01:23:51,480
You mentioned... He loved the Yakuza series...

2157
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:53,380
But you found it too long... So I suggest...

2158
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:55,120
Like a dragon... It's shorter...

2159
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:57,060
But it touches on the previous game... So you can...

2160
01:23:57,060 --> 01:23:59,160
Get a feel for the series... Thank you... Thank you... Thank you...

2161
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:00,960
Thank you... No matter what...

2162
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,560
The reason why... I have not... I think I've talked about this before...

2163
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:05,900
But like... Um... I don't touch the Yakuza series...

2164
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:06,640
Because like...

2165
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:09,020
Even though like... No matter what...

2166
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:10,700
Their defi...

2167
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:13,140
The Yakuza definition of like...

2168
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:14,800
Short... Is like...

2169
01:24:15,020 --> 01:24:16,520
Really... Still really long...

2170
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:18,260
Hahaha...

2171
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:19,460
Hahaha...

2172
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:22,880
It... It...

2173
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:24,500
It...

2174
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:26,740
It... Like... It's like...

2175
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:29,280
A shorter version of Yakuza...

2176
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:30,740
But like... It's still...

2177
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:32,160
Incredibly long...

2178
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,080
Like... It's... It's...

2179
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:37,280
Still a very very very long game...

2180
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:38,840
And it's like... You have to dedicate like...

2181
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,740
At least like... A month...

2182
01:24:40,740 --> 01:24:42,800
Like... Sandland took us a while...

2183
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,940
But Sandland is actually known as...

2184
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:45,920
Like... One in the...

2185
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:48,220
Sandland is supposed to be like...

2186
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:50,420
A short RPG...

2187
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:52,280
Um... Action RPG...

2188
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:55,300
But even then... Like... Sandland took us a long...

2189
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:56,220
Time...

2190
01:24:57,020 --> 01:24:57,340
Hahaha...

2191
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,140
Like... I think it took us like...

2192
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:03,320
A month and a half to finish Sandland...

2193
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:04,460
So... So...

2194
01:25:04,460 --> 01:25:07,120
That's why like... I try to not...

2195
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:09,000
Um...

2196
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,260
Try to play... Not...

2197
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:13,000
Try to... Uh... Not touch games that...

2198
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,280
Are like... Incredibly long...

2199
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,360
Because I know like... My strengths...

2200
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:17,860
And I'm definitely like...

2201
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:19,980
Guys... I can't read guys...

2202
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:21,180
Like... Hahaha...

2203
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:23,500
Guys... Your Oshii is illiterate...

2204
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:24,660
Guys... Hahaha...

2205
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:25,700
Hahaha...

2206
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:30,120
So like...

2207
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:31,920
We'll both struggle...

2208
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:32,660
Hahaha...

2209
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:35,560
I swear... I feel like...

2210
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:39,040
I feel like I'm making you guys more stupid too...

2211
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:40,920
I feel like the longer you guys watch me...

2212
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:42,580
Like... I feel like we both...

2213
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Are like... Feeding into each other's illiteracy...

2214
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:47,440
Hahaha...

2215
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:48,960
Hahaha...

2216
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:48,980
Hahaha...

2217
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:53,000
I'm making you... I'm also making you...

2218
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,760
As illiterate as me...

2219
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:56,920
The longer you watch me...

2220
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:58,020
Hahaha...

2221
01:25:59,200 --> 01:25:59,920
Um...

2222
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:02,600
But that's why I tend to like...

2223
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:04,860
Avoid... Uh... JRPGs...

2224
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:06,340
Because like... I know that...

2225
01:26:06,340 --> 01:26:09,160
It's not my strength... And there's like... A lot of other...

2226
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:10,400
Streamers who are...

2227
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,520
Much better at streaming...

2228
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,500
JRPGs than me...

2229
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:14,600
Hahaha...

2230
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:18,740
That's okay... I don't... I'm here to make sure...

2231
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:20,760
You turn off your brain when you watch me...

2232
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:21,900
Um...

2233
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:24,500
No... No... Thank you for the super chat... Thank you... Thank you...

2234
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:26,280
Uh...

2235
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:28,580
And visual novels... Oh my god...

2236
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:30,280
You know like... What else...

2237
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:32,460
Oh my god... So like...

2238
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:33,780
I realized... Like...

2239
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:36,440
I actually thought about it for a while...

2240
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,080
But I was like... Oh my god...

2241
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:41,020
I could potentially stream Corpse Party...

2242
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:42,280
But then like...

2243
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,200
I was re-watching...

2244
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:47,220
Oh my gosh... I was re-watching Corpse Party...

2245
01:26:47,220 --> 01:26:48,760
A playthrough... Because like...

2246
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:49,780
I don't... Corpse...

2247
01:26:49,780 --> 01:26:52,480
I used to like...

2248
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:54,760
Corpse Party was like... Super interesting...

2249
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:57,300
But then I re-watched it...

2250
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:58,660
And I was like...

2251
01:26:58,660 --> 01:27:01,620
I was re-watching Corpse Party a little bit...

2252
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:03,060
And I realized like...

2253
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:06,140
Uh... It was a very long game...

2254
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:06,540
Like...

2255
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:07,760
It's a hee hee hee...

2256
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:09,680
It's a hee hee hee...

2257
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:11,020
It's... I...

2258
01:27:11,020 --> 01:27:13,220
I was like... Oh my god... I forgot...

2259
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:15,060
It's so slow...

2260
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:20,840
It's so...

2261
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:22,220
And the writing...

2262
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:25,660
The writing is not as good as I remembered...

2263
01:27:25,660 --> 01:27:26,760
I feel like...

2264
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:28,880
Maybe I was like... Young...

2265
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:30,900
I was like...

2266
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:32,280
Really young...

2267
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:34,660
Cause like... Guys... Corpse Party...

2268
01:27:34,660 --> 01:27:37,480
Came out in 2008...

2269
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:39,060
Chat... That's...

2270
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:40,800
Guys... It is...

2271
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,680
It is a very old game...

2272
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:45,620
And I'm like thinking... I was like...

2273
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:48,100
Oh my god... I must have been...

2274
01:27:49,820 --> 01:27:50,540
Like...

2275
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:51,600
I was...

2276
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,120
Definitely like... Way too young...

2277
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:55,380
To watch this...

2278
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:55,800
...

2279
01:27:57,960 --> 01:27:59,180
I was...

2280
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:02,020
I was way too young to watch it...

2281
01:28:02,020 --> 01:28:03,420
And then I was re-watched...

2282
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:05,000
I was like... Watching like...

2283
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,160
Going through like... A vibe...

2284
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:09,020
Of it... And then...

2285
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:11,920
I was like...

2286
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:14,140
I was like...

2287
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:14,800
I was like...

2288
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,100
16 years ago...

2289
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:16,980
That...

2290
01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:20,260
That was 16 years ago...

2291
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:22,180
They're like... A junior...

2292
01:28:22,180 --> 01:28:24,120
In high school...

2293
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:24,740
That...

2294
01:28:27,420 --> 01:28:28,420
They...

2295
01:28:28,420 --> 01:28:31,060
They can... They can drive...

2296
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:33,000
17...

2297
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:34,260
They can...

2298
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:36,840
The game can literally drive now...

2299
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:38,260
The game can...

2300
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:39,920
What?

2301
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:45,320
Whoever said...

2302
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,000
Whoever was like...

2303
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,140
That's not that old...

2304
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:51,480
Umm...

2305
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:54,260
...

2306
01:28:55,660 --> 01:28:57,920
The flow of time...

2307
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,060
Is cruel...

2308
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:00,000
Anyway...

2309
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,940
Anyway... Umm...

2310
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:04,880
By the way... Don't watch the anime...

2311
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:06,440
For a course party...

2312
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:08,680
I watched the anime for a course party...

2313
01:29:09,180 --> 01:29:10,220
It is...

2314
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:12,440
It's really bad...

2315
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:14,640
It's...

2316
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,140
I don't remember...

2317
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:17,980
I don't remember much about it...

2318
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:20,420
I just remember it was very bad...

2319
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:21,160
So...

2320
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:24,900
And then I tried to watch the sequels...

2321
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:26,080
The play game...

2322
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:28,160
Like... How many games...

2323
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:29,060
Has course party been?

2324
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:32,500
Umm...

2325
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,100
How many... Okay... There's...

2326
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:36,140
Course party... There's...

2327
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:38,640
What the fuck...

2328
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:39,560
How many games have they made?

2329
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:41,840
They made Batman... Oh no...

2330
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:43,980
Holy shit...

2331
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:46,680
That's a lot of course party...

2332
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:47,320
What?

2333
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:50,360
Course party... Course party...

2334
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:52,160

01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:54,100
Blood covered... Course party...

2336
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:56,420
Blood covered... Repeated... Fear...

2337
01:29:56,420 --> 01:29:58,740
Course party... Book of Shadows...

2338
01:29:58,740 --> 01:30:00,880
Course party... Sweet Sachiko's...

2339
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:02,420
Hysteric birthday bash...

2340
01:30:02,420 --> 01:30:04,820
Course party... Two dead patients...

2341
01:30:04,820 --> 01:30:06,260
Course party... Blood...

01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:08,800

2343
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:09,820

Course party... Two darkest... What are these...

2345
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:14,380
When did they make...

2346
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:15,540
All of these...

2347
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:17,220
Course party...

2348
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:20,560
What the fuck... I didn't even realize...

2349
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:22,140
There was that many...

2350
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:23,340
Course party...

2351
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:26,200
That's a lot more than I...

2352
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:27,740
Thought there was...

2353
01:30:27,740 --> 01:30:30,020
All I remember was the original...

2354
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:32,580
Course party... I heard like...

2355
01:30:33,780 --> 01:30:34,540
Umm...

2356
01:30:34,540 --> 01:30:36,420
I tried to watch a play through...

2357
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:38,060
Of the PSP game...

2358
01:30:38,060 --> 01:30:39,320
That somebody... When was it?

2359
01:30:39,380 --> 01:30:40,320
It was a course party...

2360
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:42,720
No... It was like... Was it Book of Shadows?

2361
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:45,520
I tried to watch one of the newest ones...

2362
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:46,640
Umm... Oh yeah the playstation...

2363
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:47,420
Was it Blood Drive?

2364
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:49,840
It's not as good... It's...

2365
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:52,420
It's like... I think cause...

2366
01:30:52,420 --> 01:30:54,200
Oh yeah they went with like a 3D model...

2367
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:56,320
I think it's always whenever they go like with 3D...

2368
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:58,260
It just starts being not as good...

2369
01:30:58,260 --> 01:30:58,920
Like...

2370
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:01,240
Hahahaha...

2371
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:03,020
Hahahaha...

2372
01:31:04,940 --> 01:31:05,380
But...

2373
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:07,980
Oh my god...

2374
01:31:07,980 --> 01:31:09,540
It's actually...

2375
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:12,180
Uhh... Yeah the chibi one...

2376
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:14,140
Where they use like... It's just cause they use...

2377
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:16,380
Chibi models... And like it always...

2378
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:18,820
Feels weird when they like...

2379
01:31:18,820 --> 01:31:20,320
When... It's just like...

2380
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:22,140
Cause it's supposed to be like this...

2381
01:31:22,140 --> 01:31:24,260
Horror game... And then...

2382
01:31:24,260 --> 01:31:26,140
They use like... Like...

2383
01:31:26,140 --> 01:31:27,800
Like... Umm...

2384
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:29,880
What's that style called?

2385
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:31,020
The original course party?

2386
01:31:31,340 --> 01:31:33,440
What was the style called?

2387
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:36,060
The... Uhh... Yeah...

2388
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:37,380
It just starts being scary...

2389
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:38,800
In the chibi style...

2390
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:42,840
Uhh... These corpses party more than I do!

2391
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:44,320
Hahahaha...

2392
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:46,780
Yeah the RPG maker...

2393
01:31:46,780 --> 01:31:48,900
Yeah... Like the RPG maker...

2394
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:49,740
Has like...

2395
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:51,180
A charm in it...

2396
01:31:51,180 --> 01:31:53,060
Where like... Umm...

2397
01:31:53,060 --> 01:31:54,540
Where... You know...

2398
01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:57,220
It has such a charm in it for the horror genre...

2399
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:58,560
That when they started...

2400
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:02,140
When they did the chibi style to it...

2401
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:04,480
It just like lessens the horror...

2402
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,580
But also if you guys rewatch...

2403
01:32:06,580 --> 01:32:08,140
Courts party...

2404
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:10,400
Umm... The writing...

2405
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:11,860
You realize there's like...

2406
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:13,480
The writing for the game...

2407
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:16,320
Was definitely filled with... Uhh...

2408
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,220
Was not as great as...

2409
01:32:18,220 --> 01:32:18,980
Hahahaha...

2410
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:21,480
Hahahaha...

2411
01:32:22,330 --> 01:32:23,960
I... I think...

2412
01:32:24,290 --> 01:32:26,860
I... It was like...

2413
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:27,980
The...

2414
01:32:27,980 --> 01:32:30,480
It was just the part where like... You know...

2415
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:32,900
The writing...

2416
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:34,260
Yeah... I was... I was...

2417
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:35,680
I remember rewatching it...

2418
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:38,780
I was like... Wait... This was not as scary as I remembered...

2419
01:32:38,780 --> 01:32:40,220
Because there was like a scene...

2420
01:32:40,220 --> 01:32:42,340
It was a really fucked up scene...

2421
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:44,020
In there... That...

2422
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:44,680
What was it?

2423
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:46,920
Like... It just has like...

2424
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:47,700
Scary...

2425
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:49,580
I was rewatching Courts party...

2426
01:32:49,580 --> 01:32:51,960
And like... Like... I was like...

2427
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:53,520
There was a part in there... And I was like...

2428
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:56,500
You know... Like one of the most scary... I'm gonna spoiler alert for it...

2429
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:57,940
I was... I'll spo...

2430
01:32:57,940 --> 01:32:59,860
Like it was like... I'll spoiler alert for it...

2431
01:32:59,860 --> 01:33:02,680
Because it's like a game... It was just gore... It was very gory...

2432
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:04,040
Like I think that was it...

2433
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:06,540
The reason why is that...

2434
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:08,700
Like when you're like... Especially when you're watching it...

2435
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:10,800
When you're younger... Or like... Younger...

2436
01:33:11,540 --> 01:33:12,940
You're really surprised...

2437
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:13,700
Because it was like...

2438
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:17,260
The anime style... Like the anime cute style...

2439
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:18,520
Especially like RPG Maker...

2440
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:20,580
Cute style... And then they show like...

2441
01:33:20,580 --> 01:33:22,280
Gore... And then you know...

2442
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:23,980
When you're younger... You're like... Oh my...

2443
01:33:23,980 --> 01:33:26,120
It's like... You know... Happy Tree Friends... You know... Like...

2444
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,880
Like... It's like... Happy Tree Friends...

2445
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:34,460
Where... When you're younger... You're like... Oh my god...

2446
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,680
The gore... Stuff like that...

2447
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:37,300
And...

2448
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:40,620
And I remember it like...

2449
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:42,560
Uh... There was that moment...

2450
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:44,340
Where... Spoiler alert...

2451
01:33:44,340 --> 01:33:46,200
There was this really pivotal moment in there...

2452
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:48,620
That was... That basically changed the...

2453
01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:50,400
Atmosphere of the game...

2454
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:52,790
Where... Um... They bumped into two...

2455
01:33:53,020 --> 01:33:54,540
Child ghosts...

2456
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:56,780
And then they like... Threw one of the...

2457
01:33:56,780 --> 01:33:58,140
The students...

2458
01:33:58,140 --> 01:34:00,320
Against the wall... And like she exploded...

2459
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:02,060
Into guts... Stuff like that...

2460
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:04,240
And then you know... It was like the first...

2461
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:06,280
It was like the first... Like...

2462
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:08,600
In your face... Um...

2463
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:12,060
In your face moment... Where like...

2464
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:14,200
Shit... This game is real... Like...

2465
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:18,340
Yeah... Yeah... And like... You know...

2466
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:20,560
That was like... That scene left an...

2467
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,000
Impress... Like... That's literally like...

2468
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,240
There's two scenes... That I...

2469
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:26,200
Cause like... In Corpse Party...

2470
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:28,320
I literally only remembered...

2471
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:30,800
Two scenes... From there...

2472
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:32,340
And... Cause it was like...

2473
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:34,400
The most fucked up moments...

2474
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:35,940
Like... Like... I was like...

2475
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:38,480
They added that into the game...

2476
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:40,060
One of them...

2477
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:41,400
Was that one...

2478
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:43,940
The second one...

2479
01:34:43,940 --> 01:34:46,140
Was where... I thought...

2480
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:47,880
I was like... I...

2481
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:49,940
I remember when I was a kid...

2482
01:34:49,940 --> 01:34:51,960
I was a kid... When that happened...

2483
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:54,600
When I watched... When I watched that play through...

2484
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:55,900
As a kid...

2485
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:57,940
And I was like... What the fuck...

2486
01:34:57,940 --> 01:34:59,020
Why is it here?

2487
01:35:00,010 --> 01:35:01,240
Why was this...

2488
01:35:02,340 --> 01:35:03,780
And then... You know... As you got older...

2489
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:05,300
You realize... Why...

2490
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:07,240
They made that scene...

2491
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:09,360
But it was when the little sister...

2492
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:12,340
Kept being like... I need to use the bathroom...

2493
01:35:12,900 --> 01:35:13,440
Like...

2494
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:18,140
And that scene...

2495
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:19,840
Like... As a child...

2496
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:20,240
Like...

2497
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:21,380
I was like... Why?

2498
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:23,820
And then... Yeah...

2499
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:30,440
Those were...

2500
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:32,080
The two scenes...

2501
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:34,260
That like... Imprinted in my...

2502
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:35,960
Mind... It was literally like...

2503
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:37,740
The only scenes...

2504
01:35:37,740 --> 01:35:39,900
I remembered... Like...

2505
01:35:43,020 --> 01:35:44,540
Oh my god...

2506
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:44,940
Oh my god...

2507
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:46,520
They were the only scenes...

2508
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:48,020
I remembered...

2509
01:35:48,020 --> 01:35:50,260
Because they were left...

2510
01:35:50,260 --> 01:35:52,280
Like a fucking... They left like...

2511
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:53,500
Oh my god...

2512
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:53,800
Like...

2513
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:57,240
And then... So then I like...

2514
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:59,340
Rewatched... Course priority... Because I used to be like...

2515
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:01,460
Obsessed with course priority... Back then...

2516
01:36:01,460 --> 01:36:03,840
Like a lot of people... Were super obsessed...

2517
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:04,760
With course priority...

2518
01:36:05,980 --> 01:36:07,100
Every youtuber...

2519
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:09,040
Every youtuber...

2520
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:10,040
Um...

2521
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:13,520
Streamed it... Every... Not streamed it...

2522
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:15,440
Did a let's play of it... It was like...

2523
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:16,140
What was it?

2524
01:36:16,180 --> 01:36:17,120
It was the purple...

2525
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:19,440
I know... Was it the Oni?

2526
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:20,900
Oh my gosh... What was it?

2527
01:36:21,460 --> 01:36:22,020
The...

2528
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:24,940
That other RPG game...

2529
01:36:24,940 --> 01:36:26,620
It was the Ioni...

2530
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:29,680
That... Course priority...

2531
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:31,120
Um...

2532
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:34,260
The witch one... The... Witches have...

2533
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:35,480
The house... Was that one of them?

2534
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:36,640
That's what it was called...

2535
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:37,940
Uh...

2536
01:36:40,140 --> 01:36:41,260
Mad father...

2537
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:42,600
Uh...

2538
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:44,080
What else?

2539
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:45,660
I think that was like...

2540
01:36:45,660 --> 01:36:45,840
Uh...

2541
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:46,340
Ib?

2542
01:36:47,620 --> 01:36:48,920
Oh yeah... There is Ib...

2543
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:51,640
And then... Yeah... These were like...

2544
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:53,760
The... I think like the top...

2545
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:56,400
The five games... That were going around...

2546
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:57,960
Like RPG maker games...

2547
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:59,560
Were so popular back then...

2548
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:01,800
And these were like the five ones that kept...

2549
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:03,320
Everybody kept fucking...

2550
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:04,840
Doing let's plays of...

2551
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:06,720
So then like... I remember I was like...

2552
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:10,120
I really... I like enjoyed the play throughs of that...

2553
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:12,240
And like the lore and the story of all of that...

2554
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:13,620
And then so like...

2555
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:15,640
I remember I was like... And course party...

2556
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:16,680
Was...

2557
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:19,040
One of the only games...

2558
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:21,000
That kept having sequels...

2559
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,320
For some reason...

2560
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:25,320
I don't know if you guys know this but...

2561
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:27,880
Every other RPG maker game...

2562
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:28,760
At that time...

2563
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:31,120
Had like almost no sequels...

2564
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:32,160
Or like...

2565
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:34,260
Barely any sequels...

2566
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:35,660
And course party...

2567
01:37:35,660 --> 01:37:38,380
Was literally the only game in...

2568
01:37:38,380 --> 01:37:40,820
One of the only games in that genre...

2569
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:42,160
That had like...

2570
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:44,320
A million sequels going in...

2571
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:45,160
Like... So...

2572
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:47,840
Everybody would always like...

2573
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:49,520
Keep up to date with it...

2574
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:55,820
So that's why like... I don't know...

2575
01:37:55,820 --> 01:37:58,060
They would have like anime adaptations...

2576
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:00,280
Like several anime adaptations...

2577
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:01,100
Might I add...

2578
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:01,580
And...

2579
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:05,320
Um...

2580
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:06,400
And...

2581
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:10,160
Yeah... And then like... Looking back to it...

2582
01:38:10,420 --> 01:38:12,440
Uh... Looking back to it...

2583
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:13,820
Like rewatching...

2584
01:38:13,820 --> 01:38:15,680
The gameplay of it...

2585
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:16,780
I realized...

2586
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:19,360
It wasn't as good as I remembered...

2587
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:21,480
It was definitely not as good as I remembered...

2588
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:24,740
I'm sorry...

2589
01:38:24,740 --> 01:38:26,920
Like it was definitely like...

2590
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:29,540
The scare gore factor...

2591
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:31,780
What the other games lacked...

2592
01:38:32,060 --> 01:38:34,320
Was the gore part...

2593
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:35,860
Of course party...

2594
01:38:35,860 --> 01:38:38,660
And like the shock factor of it...

2595
01:38:38,660 --> 01:38:40,300
And... But the other games...

2596
01:38:40,300 --> 01:38:42,280
Did not have that... That's why people were like...

2597
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:43,140
Oh my god...

2598
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:44,700
...

2599
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:46,520
...

2600
01:38:48,100 --> 01:38:48,700
...

2601
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:50,600
...

2602
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:53,460
Um... Yeah I feel like...

2603
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:55,640
You had to be there at that time...

2604
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:56,100
...

2605
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:58,020
And it's like...

2606
01:38:58,020 --> 01:38:59,180
Similar for...

2607
01:38:59,180 --> 01:39:02,340
Uh... Yeah it was just... It was very memorable...

2608
01:39:02,340 --> 01:39:04,320
For the time it was released...

2609
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:06,440
Because no other RPG maker...

2610
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,320
That was popular...

2611
01:39:08,660 --> 01:39:09,900
At that time...

2612
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:11,820
Like that was super popular...

2613
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:13,020
At that time...

2614
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:15,140
Had the gore...

2615
01:39:15,140 --> 01:39:17,240
That course party had...

2616
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:17,920
...

2617
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:21,840
So...

2618
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:23,260
Nowadays...

2619
01:39:23,780 --> 01:39:25,820
Um... Oh my BGM stopped... Sorry...

2620
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:27,460
Nowadays...

2621
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:29,140
There's a lot of those now...

2622
01:39:29,140 --> 01:39:34,180
There's definitely a lot of those...

2623
01:39:34,180 --> 01:39:34,560
...

2624
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:34,960
...

2625
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:37,840
...

2626
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:38,440
Um...

2627
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:40,880
Yeah...

2628
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:42,420
It was...

2629
01:39:42,420 --> 01:39:46,200
Just like a memories moment...

2630
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:47,000
There...

2631
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:47,760
...

2632
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:51,500
What was I...

2633
01:39:52,100 --> 01:39:54,360
What else do I want to talk about today...

2634
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:55,420
Um...

2635
01:39:57,700 --> 01:39:59,020
That was nice though...

2636
01:39:59,020 --> 01:40:00,620
It's nice like going through like...

2637
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:02,020
Memory lane...

2638
01:40:02,020 --> 01:40:05,000
And just like rethinking back about like...

2639
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,460
The type of games that were like super popular...

2640
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:09,300
Like 10 years...

2641
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:11,240
Not 10 years but like...

2642
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:11,840
Uh...

2643
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:12,400
...

2644
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,740
More than 10 years...

2645
01:40:17,740 --> 01:40:18,800
By the way...

2646
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:21,280
More than 10 years...

2647
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:21,760
...

2648
01:40:23,780 --> 01:40:24,420
Uh...

2649
01:40:26,540 --> 01:40:28,900
The thing is...

2650
01:40:28,900 --> 01:40:28,920
The thing is...

2651
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:29,220
There's like...

2652
01:40:29,220 --> 01:40:33,140
It's very rare to find good RPG maker games...

2653
01:40:34,100 --> 01:40:34,880
Uh...

2654
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:37,420
Good RPG maker games...

2655
01:40:38,380 --> 01:40:39,300
Nowadays...

2656
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:40,580
I feel like...

2657
01:40:40,580 --> 01:40:41,600
Um...

2658
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,560
It's just...

2659
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:44,580
Because like...

2660
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:46,060
There's always like...

2661
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:50,240
Ads and trends when it comes to certain video games...

2662
01:40:50,240 --> 01:40:51,600
Uh...

2663
01:40:51,600 --> 01:41:03,620
And RPG Maker, you know, you had to be there at around 2010 to like be there for the RPG Maker boom.

2664
01:41:04,420 --> 01:41:13,520
Where like there was a lot of RPG Maker games that had really really good story and really...

2665
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:16,240
The art might not be like as good back then too.

2666
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:20,340
Like the only reason the art improved was that it gets like re-releases or HD remakes.

2667
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:29,520
But it was like a bunch of like small town small-time artists like drawing it for their own free time and stuff.

2668
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:37,600
But it was like an interesting time back then.

2669
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:42,280
I think now the current fad right now is...

2670
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:48,000
Someone... oh yeah by the way, I saw that somebody asked me if I was gonna be at Evo.

2671
01:41:48,140 --> 01:41:50,100
I cannot confirm or deny it.

2672
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:52,060
That's...

2673
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:53,180
That's all I'll say.

2674
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:01,060
Anyway, I think like...

2675
01:42:02,970 --> 01:42:04,180
I think like...

2676
01:42:04,910 --> 01:42:09,310
The current gaming fad right now, the gaming trend right now is...

2677
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:15,260
I'm trying to like think of like what new games... I honestly think...

2678
01:42:15,910 --> 01:42:19,980
Currently the newest gaming trend is fighting games.

2679
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:22,840
Due to like...

2680
01:42:23,700 --> 01:42:24,820
A lot of stuff.

2681
01:42:24,900 --> 01:42:29,040
Oh, yeah, by the way, I thought it was so funny because it popped because like, you know, I follow like...

2682
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:30,600
From Sajam Slam.

2683
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:34,000
I follow like a lot of people from Sajam Slam on Twitter.

2684
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:37,120
So like I saw the one about...

2685
01:42:40,820 --> 01:42:43,400
That video about how some like...

2686
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:48,640
Pro player for one of like the fighting game tournament is...

2687
01:42:49,180 --> 01:42:49,960
Through a chat, he's like...

2688
01:42:49,980 --> 01:42:55,740
He's like, I'm gonna throw a chair and like destroy a lighting equipment that was worth $4,000 or something.

2689
01:42:56,080 --> 01:43:00,700
So like they subtracted their earnings and now he has a negative earning.

2690
01:43:01,060 --> 01:43:03,340
I thought that was so funny.

2691
01:43:03,980 --> 01:43:08,440
So this guy won a fighting game tournament, but like you wouldn't...

2692
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:10,280
He won barely any money.

2693
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:13,900
He won barely any money from that fighting game tournament.

2694
01:43:13,940 --> 01:43:19,740
And he celebrated by throwing a chair behind him.

2695
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:24,240
And like destroying this lighting equipment that was worth like...

2696
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:25,380
I don't know, like...

2697
01:43:25,980 --> 01:43:27,120
A lot of money.

2698
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:29,080
So now on his like...

2699
01:43:29,790 --> 01:43:32,360
Liquipedia on his like pro player...

2700
01:43:32,360 --> 01:43:33,520
Pro player...

2701
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:34,400
Uh...

2702
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,360
Tournament earnings sheet.

2703
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:38,340
He has negative earnings.

2704
01:43:39,780 --> 01:43:42,660
Yes, he was the first winner ever.

2705
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:43,880
In a...

2706
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:48,700
In like as a pro player to have a negative $2,000.

2707
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:50,120
Uh...

2708
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:52,620
Overall earnings.

2709
01:43:58,200 --> 01:43:58,760
Wait...

2710
01:43:59,660 --> 01:44:01,420
Mon, do you have a...

2711
01:44:01,420 --> 01:44:03,740
Do you have a video clip of it?

2712
01:44:06,060 --> 01:44:06,620
Uh...

2713
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:08,080
Do you have a video clip of it?

2714
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:09,020
I saw it on Twitter.

2715
01:44:09,300 --> 01:44:09,860
It was...

2716
01:44:09,860 --> 01:44:10,500
I was like...

2717
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:11,680
What the fuck?

2718
01:44:12,220 --> 01:44:13,540
He actually...

2719
01:44:13,540 --> 01:44:14,840
And like...

2720
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:16,320
And then somebody was like...

2721
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:18,680
That was like not even a good winner.

2722
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:19,220
Like...

2723
01:44:25,220 --> 01:44:27,570
Yeah, like people were saying like...

2724
01:44:27,570 --> 01:44:29,490
He didn't like...

2725
01:44:29,490 --> 01:44:29,870
The...

2726
01:44:29,870 --> 01:44:32,770
The matchup wasn't even like that great.

2727
01:44:33,030 --> 01:44:33,670
Like...

2728
01:44:40,070 --> 01:44:40,850
Um...

2729
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:42,590
Alright, let's see.

2730
01:44:42,670 --> 01:44:45,790
He didn't fully commit to the pop-up.

2731
01:44:45,950 --> 01:44:48,690
Basically he won the dead.

2732
01:44:52,610 --> 01:44:53,690
Alright, let's see.

2733
01:44:53,810 --> 01:44:55,110
I'm gonna see if I can...

2734
01:44:55,110 --> 01:44:56,490
Let me see if I can find the video.

2735
01:44:56,710 --> 01:45:00,270
I just love the Twitter comments of people like roasting in there like...

2736
01:45:00,270 --> 01:45:01,450
It wasn't even like...

2737
01:45:01,450 --> 01:45:04,610
That good of a pop-off though.

2738
01:45:05,190 --> 01:45:06,670
I was just like...

2739
01:45:06,670 --> 01:45:07,530
It was so...

2740
01:45:09,210 --> 01:45:11,330
Which I thought was the funniest part.

2741
01:45:11,750 --> 01:45:13,350
Let's see if they update it.

2742
01:45:13,490 --> 01:45:14,350
Oh, they didn't.

2743
01:45:14,350 --> 01:45:16,150
Okay, I want to see if they update it.

2744
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:16,690
Oh, they deleted...

2745
01:45:17,190 --> 01:45:18,710
Oh, they deleted his Wikipedia.

2746
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:19,990
That's sad.

2747
01:45:19,990 --> 01:45:21,450
Wait, that's actually sad.

2748
01:45:21,750 --> 01:45:22,430
Why did they...

2749
01:45:23,830 --> 01:45:24,430
Wait...

2750
01:45:24,430 --> 01:45:26,990
They deleted his Liquipedia.

2751
01:45:30,290 --> 01:45:31,990
Wait, did they actually?

2752
01:45:32,630 --> 01:45:34,230
He used to have it.

2753
01:45:34,230 --> 01:45:36,090
He literally had a Liquipedia.

2754
01:45:36,210 --> 01:45:37,230
I saw it.

2755
01:45:37,350 --> 01:45:38,710
I saw it too.

2756
01:45:38,950 --> 01:45:39,830
And it's like...

2757
01:45:39,830 --> 01:45:40,430
It's gone.

2758
01:45:41,930 --> 01:45:43,150
Oh my God.

2759
01:45:43,210 --> 01:45:45,070
They actually deleted it.

2760
01:45:45,250 --> 01:45:46,370
That's so funny.

2761
01:45:47,830 --> 01:45:48,630
Oh yeah.

2762
01:45:48,630 --> 01:45:49,650
Because the price...

2763
01:45:50,150 --> 01:45:50,950
Oh yeah.

2764
01:45:51,130 --> 01:45:52,170
Okay, this is why.

2765
01:45:52,730 --> 01:45:53,130
Okay.

2766
01:45:56,070 --> 01:45:56,870
All right.

2767
01:45:56,910 --> 01:45:58,730
So I'm going to show you guys...

2768
01:45:58,730 --> 01:45:59,010
Okay, wait.

2769
01:45:59,150 --> 01:45:59,970
Is it JPEG?

2770
01:46:00,250 --> 01:46:01,170
God damn it.

2771
01:46:01,210 --> 01:46:02,390
Why is it always a web?

2772
01:46:03,210 --> 01:46:03,730
All right.

2773
01:46:03,810 --> 01:46:06,930
I'll show you guys the picture and then I'll show you guys the clip.

2774
01:46:07,190 --> 01:46:09,510
Well, I'll link you guys the clip and not show you guys the clip.

2775
01:46:10,790 --> 01:46:11,310
Let's see.

2776
01:46:11,370 --> 01:46:12,310
Where is it on Twitter?

2777
01:46:12,930 --> 01:46:13,830
Where is it?

2778
01:46:13,850 --> 01:46:14,570
Oh, here you go.

2779
01:46:16,130 --> 01:46:18,130
Where the fuck is the pop-off?

2780
01:46:18,210 --> 01:46:18,610
Oh, there it is.

2781
01:46:18,630 --> 01:46:20,550
I want to see the pop-off clip.

2782
01:46:20,850 --> 01:46:21,570
Oh, sorry.

2783
01:46:21,650 --> 01:46:22,530
Not the pop-off.

2784
01:46:22,530 --> 01:46:23,350
The fucking...

2785
01:46:23,350 --> 01:46:27,210
By the way, the prize money was literally $500.

2786
01:46:27,650 --> 01:46:28,990
So people were like...

2787
01:46:33,450 --> 01:46:36,070
They were like, this was not worth it.

2788
01:46:37,310 --> 01:46:38,030
There we go.

2789
01:46:38,170 --> 01:46:39,110
This is the...

2790
01:46:41,530 --> 01:46:43,010
This was the video clip.

2791
01:46:43,210 --> 01:46:44,590
And like this was the...

2792
01:46:44,590 --> 01:46:46,930
Let me grab the screenshot.

2793
01:46:47,290 --> 01:46:48,050
Oh, there it is.

2794
01:46:48,050 --> 01:46:48,070
Oh, there it is.

2795
01:46:48,070 --> 01:46:53,150
This is a screenshot of how much money he lost.

2796
01:46:53,770 --> 01:47:02,170
So basically, like it was a $3,000 light and he literally just won $565.

2797
01:47:02,830 --> 01:47:04,510
So he actually...

2798
01:47:04,510 --> 01:47:05,270
He...

2799
01:47:05,270 --> 01:47:12,150
No, but the reason why I said just $500 is because he literally broke a lighting equipment that's $3,000.

2800
01:47:12,490 --> 01:47:13,170
Like...

2801
01:47:13,170 --> 01:47:14,010
Oh, my God.

2802
01:47:14,010 --> 01:47:14,630
Oh, my God.

2803
01:47:14,910 --> 01:47:16,250
Oh, my God.

2804
01:47:16,330 --> 01:47:17,010
Oh, my God.

2805
01:47:22,300 --> 01:47:23,400
That's why...

2806
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:25,700
That's why people were like...

2807
01:47:25,700 --> 01:47:28,680
People were like, what the fuck?

2808
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:31,880
I wish I saw...

2809
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:32,760
I wish like...

2810
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:36,960
I saw the tweet about like...

2811
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:37,880
I wish...

2812
01:47:37,880 --> 01:47:38,540
Oh, my gosh.

2813
01:47:38,580 --> 01:47:40,640
I wish somebody has that...

2814
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:41,520
Where is that tweet?

2815
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:42,300
It was so funny.

2816
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:42,760
I saw...

2817
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:43,060
It was...

2818
01:47:43,060 --> 01:47:44,800
I saw the Liquipedia entry too.

2819
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:47,400
And they literally gave him like negative...

2820
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:49,380
Like he literally wrote negative...

2821
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:52,180
And it got deleted.

2822
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:53,320
It got deleted!

2823
01:47:53,940 --> 01:47:57,540
They actually deleted his Liquipedia!

2824
01:47:57,900 --> 01:48:01,230
That's actually a cool name!

2825
01:48:01,270 --> 01:48:03,050
They deleted their Liquipedia!

2826
01:48:03,590 --> 01:48:05,390
Also, the reason why...

2827
01:48:05,390 --> 01:48:07,550
It's sort of easy to tell...

2828
01:48:11,110 --> 01:48:13,130
It's sort of easy to tell...

2829
01:48:14,530 --> 01:48:17,270
What is the current gaming trend.

2830
01:48:17,530 --> 01:48:19,270
You just see what Riot's doing.

2831
01:48:19,270 --> 01:48:21,690
So, they're currently working.

2832
01:48:22,050 --> 01:48:23,970
The thing is...

2833
01:48:23,970 --> 01:48:28,390
Riot is really good at figuring out what is the newest gaming trend.

2834
01:48:28,770 --> 01:48:30,470
And what to capitalize on.

2835
01:48:30,570 --> 01:48:31,070
What to develop.

2836
01:48:31,350 --> 01:48:32,450
I don't know if you guys saw this.

2837
01:48:32,570 --> 01:48:36,130
They cancelled a platform fighter.

2838
01:48:36,450 --> 01:48:39,750
But they're releasing a new fighting game.

2839
01:48:40,310 --> 01:48:46,110
They released a new fighting game.

2840
01:48:46,330 --> 01:48:46,890
To...

2841
01:48:46,890 --> 01:48:48,170
To...

2842
01:48:49,270 --> 01:48:51,370
To capitalize on the fighting game genre.

2843
01:48:52,850 --> 01:48:53,470
So...

2844
01:48:53,470 --> 01:48:54,210
What is it?

2845
01:48:54,270 --> 01:48:55,330
The 2x KO?

2846
01:48:55,570 --> 01:49:00,030
I just think fighting games right now is currently the most popular gaming trend at the moment.

2847
01:49:01,510 --> 01:49:03,450
Because there's always gaming trend.

2848
01:49:03,810 --> 01:49:06,230
A couple of years ago, it was Battle Royale.

2849
01:49:06,410 --> 01:49:07,370
Now we're dying.

2850
01:49:07,650 --> 01:49:10,150
And now it's fighting games right now.

2851
01:49:10,330 --> 01:49:11,790
Especially competitive wise.

2852
01:49:12,090 --> 01:49:13,770
I feel like competitive wise...

2853
01:49:13,770 --> 01:49:15,070
Also, I'm pretty sure...

2854
01:49:15,070 --> 01:49:19,010
Riot is going into the fighting game genre.

2855
01:49:19,010 --> 01:49:24,530
So they can capitalize on fighting game tournaments as well.

2856
01:49:24,730 --> 01:49:25,890
Because like eSports.

2857
01:49:26,170 --> 01:49:26,490
Because they...

2858
01:49:27,750 --> 01:49:30,130
What Riot is really really good at...

2859
01:49:30,130 --> 01:49:34,010
Is making games for competitive eSports.

2860
01:49:35,290 --> 01:49:36,770
And I feel like...

2861
01:49:36,770 --> 01:49:38,710
I'm pretty sure they went for it.

2862
01:49:38,850 --> 01:49:40,090
They went for the new fighting game.

2863
01:49:40,090 --> 01:49:43,310
They went for fighting game because they want to get in on the EVO action.

2864
01:49:43,450 --> 01:49:46,770
As well as other tournaments that they can host themselves as well.

2865
01:49:47,590 --> 01:49:48,110
Umm...

2866
01:49:49,010 --> 01:49:50,110
Yeah, they're pretty...

2867
01:49:50,110 --> 01:49:51,610
Yeah, they're really good at...

2868
01:49:52,190 --> 01:49:52,710
Uhh...

2869
01:49:52,710 --> 01:49:54,910
They're really really good at...

2870
01:49:54,910 --> 01:49:55,850
Uhh...

2871
01:49:55,850 --> 01:49:58,550
At running like eSports events and stuff in general.

2872
01:49:58,650 --> 01:49:59,930
So I'm not surprised about that.

2873
01:50:00,230 --> 01:50:04,150
They really gotta figure out what games have like good eSports potential.

2874
01:50:08,140 --> 01:50:08,660
Umm...

2875
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:10,680
Yeah.

2876
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:13,660
I just think like that's the current trend when it comes to gaming.

2877
01:50:14,620 --> 01:50:15,140
Umm...

2878
01:50:15,140 --> 01:50:17,920
FPS is gonna die out.

2879
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:18,740
Like...

2880
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:19,840
Uhh...

2881
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:23,980
Like RTS.

2882
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:25,160
We're gonna die...

2883
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:28,120
The FPS is gonna die out soon just like RTS.

2884
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:30,800
Uhh...

2885
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:35,540
Say it ain't so...

2886
01:50:35,540 --> 01:50:37,720
We're gonna be just like them.

2887
01:50:38,020 --> 01:50:40,820
We're gonna be just like them.

2888
01:50:43,740 --> 01:50:45,440
RTS has new games?

2889
01:50:45,900 --> 01:50:46,860
Like what?

2890
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:48,980
Name me...

2891
01:50:48,980 --> 01:50:52,240
Name me one right now that has...

2892
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:52,900
Like...

2893
01:50:55,420 --> 01:50:58,360
That has like an actual player base.

2894
01:50:58,680 --> 01:51:01,020
That's not less than like...

2895
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:07,920
That's not less than like 5000 players.

2896
01:51:10,020 --> 01:51:10,560
Hahaha...

2897
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:12,100
Hahaha...

2898
01:51:14,420 --> 01:51:14,960
Umm...

2899
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:16,280
What else was I gonna say?

2900
01:51:16,460 --> 01:51:17,360
What else was I gonna say?

2901
01:51:17,540 --> 01:51:20,100
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh...

2902
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:21,260
Uhh...

2903
01:51:21,260 --> 01:51:22,800
There's an upcoming RTS.

2904
01:51:22,980 --> 01:51:26,520
It's just gonna die out in like a month and you know it.

2905
01:51:26,620 --> 01:51:28,300
You know it.

2906
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:30,120
Hahaha...

2907
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:33,780
Umm...

2908
01:51:33,780 --> 01:51:34,900
Like I said...

2909
01:51:34,900 --> 01:51:37,960
Whoever said Stellaris, that's not an RTS.

2910
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:41,080
Someone's very passionate about Stellaris.

2911
01:51:43,060 --> 01:51:43,540
Umm...

2912
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:47,080
Oh my gosh there's something on mine.

2913
01:51:47,260 --> 01:51:47,800
But I forgot.

2914
01:51:48,060 --> 01:51:48,500
God damn it.

2915
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:51,020
You know when you have like a thought in your mind and you just forgot.

2916
01:51:52,040 --> 01:51:52,520
Umm...

2917
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:53,500
Oh my god what was it?

2918
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:54,740
Ahhh...

2919
01:51:55,980 --> 01:51:56,420
Nooo...

2920
01:51:56,420 --> 01:51:57,020
I don't remember.

2921
01:51:57,860 --> 01:51:58,300
Hahaha...

2922
01:51:58,300 --> 01:51:59,300
I don't...

2923
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:01,040
Hahaha...

2924
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:02,200
Nooo...

2925
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:03,200
I don't remember.

2926
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:03,620
Oh!

2927
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:04,100
Oh!

2928
01:52:04,860 --> 01:52:06,160
I saw like...

2929
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:06,740
What is it called?

2930
01:52:07,020 --> 01:52:08,360
I wrote it down in my calendar.

2931
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:09,980
But they're open up...

2932
01:52:10,620 --> 01:52:12,300
Opening up a...

2933
01:52:13,100 --> 01:52:13,540
Uhh...

2934
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:15,000
There's a new game.

2935
01:52:15,140 --> 01:52:16,560
Early Access is coming out.

2936
01:52:16,660 --> 01:52:17,100
Concord!

2937
01:52:17,260 --> 01:52:17,520
Yeah!

2938
01:52:18,240 --> 01:52:20,900
Uhh... I saw like people were playing Concord...

2939
01:52:20,900 --> 01:52:21,860
This week.

2940
01:52:22,180 --> 01:52:22,740
Uhh...

2941
01:52:22,740 --> 01:52:24,080
Because it was in Early Access.

2942
01:52:24,300 --> 01:52:24,780
It's like...

2943
01:52:24,780 --> 01:52:26,200
The newest...

2944
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:27,760
Call of Duty...

2945
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:28,040
Slash...

2946
01:52:29,540 --> 01:52:30,100
Uhh...

2947
01:52:30,100 --> 01:52:33,020
It's like basically Call of Duty with different heroes.

2948
01:52:33,740 --> 01:52:34,300
And...

2949
01:52:34,300 --> 01:52:35,060
Umm...

2950
01:52:35,060 --> 01:52:36,660
I was like thinking about it.

2951
01:52:36,820 --> 01:52:38,280
We all know it's gonna die in a week.

2952
01:52:38,420 --> 01:52:38,980
But like...

2953
01:52:39,900 --> 01:52:40,460
Hahaha...

2954
01:52:44,260 --> 01:52:44,820
We...

2955
01:52:44,820 --> 01:52:46,020
We all...

2956
01:52:46,020 --> 01:52:46,420
Yeah...

2957
01:52:46,420 --> 01:52:49,600
We all know it's gonna die in like a week or so.

2958
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:50,100
So...

2959
01:52:51,380 --> 01:52:51,820
But...

2960
01:52:51,820 --> 01:52:53,880
I'm just like wondering if I should try it out.

2961
01:52:54,160 --> 01:52:54,480
Umm...

2962
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:55,360
I'm gonna play...

2963
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:55,920
What is it?

2964
01:52:56,020 --> 01:52:57,820
I'm gonna play Marvel Rivals though.

2965
01:52:59,360 --> 01:52:59,800
Umm...

2966
01:52:59,800 --> 01:53:02,820
I asked the dev team to get the...

2967
01:53:02,820 --> 01:53:03,440
Uhh...

2968
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:04,900
To get a code for Marvel Rivals.

2969
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:05,760
So...

2970
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:06,300
We're gonna...

2971
01:53:06,300 --> 01:53:06,900
I think Beta...

2972
01:53:06,900 --> 01:53:08,000
Beta is opening next week?

2973
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:08,520
Yeah.

2974
01:53:08,660 --> 01:53:09,100
Beta...

2975
01:53:09,100 --> 01:53:09,440
Uhh...

2976
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:12,220
The next Beta test is opening next week.

2977
01:53:12,580 --> 01:53:13,020
So...

2978
01:53:13,020 --> 01:53:13,940
I think I'm just gonna...

2979
01:53:13,940 --> 01:53:15,780
Because I was like debating if I should try Concord.

2980
01:53:15,980 --> 01:53:16,760
But I'm like...

2981
01:53:16,760 --> 01:53:17,180
Oh my god.

2982
01:53:17,220 --> 01:53:17,900
That game...

2983
01:53:17,900 --> 01:53:18,360
I'm sorry.

2984
01:53:18,440 --> 01:53:19,620
But that game looks so boring.

2985
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:20,080
I'm just gonna...

2986
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:20,500
Concord...

2987
01:53:20,820 --> 01:53:22,300
Concord looks so fucking boring.

2988
01:53:22,940 --> 01:53:23,260
Like...

2989
01:53:23,260 --> 01:53:23,980
I can't...

2990
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:25,720
Like...

2991
01:53:25,720 --> 01:53:28,420
I was watching it and I'm just like...

2992
01:53:28,420 --> 01:53:29,000
It's just...

2993
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:30,220
It's just Call of...

2994
01:53:30,220 --> 01:53:31,520
It's literally like...

2995
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:32,280
They put...

2996
01:53:32,280 --> 01:53:33,380
They try to be like...

2997
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:35,000
They try to be like it's a hero shooter.

2998
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:36,460
But like...

2999
01:53:36,460 --> 01:53:37,140
Umm...

3000
01:53:37,140 --> 01:53:39,200
But they make it Call of Duty style.

3001
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:41,560
So it's barely like a team shooter.

3002
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:43,920
It feels more so of just like...

3003
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:44,940
Umm...

3004
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:47,920
It feels more so of just...

3005
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:49,580
Call of Duty with heroes.

3006
01:53:49,680 --> 01:53:49,960
Yeah.

3007
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:51,540
It's basically Call of Duty with heroes.

3008
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:53,140
But it looks worse than Call of Duty.

3009
01:53:53,340 --> 01:53:53,720
So like...

3010
01:53:53,720 --> 01:53:54,080
I don't know.

3011
01:53:54,140 --> 01:53:55,180
I was watching a bit of...

3012
01:53:55,180 --> 01:53:56,560
I was watching Shroud play it.

3013
01:53:56,580 --> 01:53:56,940
Was it Shroud?

3014
01:53:57,020 --> 01:53:57,100
No.

3015
01:53:57,140 --> 01:53:57,540
I was watching...

3016
01:53:57,540 --> 01:53:59,080
I was watching Lyric play it.

3017
01:53:59,420 --> 01:53:59,780
Uh...

3018
01:53:59,780 --> 01:54:01,380
Cause Lyric was literally like the most...

3019
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:02,360
Pop...

3020
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:02,680
Like...

3021
01:54:02,680 --> 01:54:03,620
You know like when you...

3022
01:54:03,620 --> 01:54:03,980
Most...

3023
01:54:03,980 --> 01:54:05,040
The biggest streamer...

3024
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:07,720
The biggest streamer that was playing it at that time.

3025
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:08,680
So...

3026
01:54:08,680 --> 01:54:09,020
Yeah.

3027
01:54:09,060 --> 01:54:09,420
It looked...

3028
01:54:09,420 --> 01:54:09,780
Oh yeah.

3029
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:11,360
It looked like Destiny 2 PvP.

3030
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:11,780
Yeah.

3031
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:12,140
I agree.

3032
01:54:12,340 --> 01:54:13,940
It looked like Destiny 2 PvP.

3033
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:16,180
So I was just watching it and I'm just like...

3034
01:54:16,180 --> 01:54:16,880
I don't know.

3035
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:19,800
It doesn't seem like it had anything new to the formula.

3036
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:20,820
So I was...

3037
01:54:20,820 --> 01:54:21,440
It was just...

3038
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:23,000
It was just like...

3039
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,020
Space Call of Duty I guess.

3040
01:54:25,220 --> 01:54:25,380
Like...

3041
01:54:26,620 --> 01:54:27,660
But then...

3042
01:54:27,660 --> 01:54:31,040
Space Call of Duty is basically Destiny PvP.

3043
01:54:31,540 --> 01:54:32,060
So...

3044
01:54:32,060 --> 01:54:32,640
Like...

3045
01:54:32,640 --> 01:54:36,480
How could they improve on that when Destiny already has it for free?

3046
01:54:36,700 --> 01:54:37,160
So...

3047
01:54:42,740 --> 01:54:44,220
So most likely...

3048
01:54:44,220 --> 01:54:46,660
Most likely I'll just be playing Marvel Rivals next week.

3049
01:54:46,860 --> 01:54:47,540
I might...

3050
01:54:47,540 --> 01:54:49,480
I might play some Marvel Rivals next week.

3051
01:54:49,580 --> 01:54:50,520
I'm thinking of like...

3052
01:54:51,420 --> 01:54:51,940
Um...

3053
01:54:51,940 --> 01:54:52,400
I don't know.

3054
01:54:52,520 --> 01:54:53,260
Maybe I'll...

3055
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:53,960
I'll try...

3056
01:54:55,260 --> 01:54:55,660
Um...

3057
01:54:55,660 --> 01:54:56,340
Uh...

3058
01:54:56,340 --> 01:54:58,080
Play more rank on it too.

3059
01:54:58,500 --> 01:54:58,900
Maybe.

3060
01:54:59,240 --> 01:55:00,400
But I'm not sure though.

3061
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:01,120
I feel like...

3062
01:55:01,120 --> 01:55:01,920
We'll see.

3063
01:55:01,960 --> 01:55:02,640
We'll see how I feel.

3064
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:03,140
Anyway!

3065
01:55:03,200 --> 01:55:04,580
I just realized it's been two hours.

3066
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:05,160
Oh my god!

3067
01:55:05,200 --> 01:55:06,020
I've been talking for...

3068
01:55:06,020 --> 01:55:07,920
I've been yapping for two hours!

3069
01:55:08,580 --> 01:55:08,980
Oh!

3070
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:10,380
Oh my god.

3071
01:55:10,420 --> 01:55:11,080
We had like...

3072
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:12,920
This week I felt like I streamed a lot for this week.

3073
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:13,420
Not gonna lie.

3074
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:15,360
Um...

3075
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:17,100
I streamed a lot this week.

3076
01:55:17,700 --> 01:55:18,100
Um...

3077
01:55:18,100 --> 01:55:18,660
Um...

3078
01:55:18,660 --> 01:55:21,400
So maybe that's why I feel like more tired in general.

3079
01:55:21,660 --> 01:55:22,740
But it was...

3080
01:55:22,740 --> 01:55:24,060
It's been a great time.

3081
01:55:24,200 --> 01:55:25,960
Just talking to you guys.

3082
01:55:26,020 --> 01:55:26,860
Just hanging out.

3083
01:55:27,020 --> 01:55:28,960
And having conversations with you guys.

3084
01:55:30,380 --> 01:55:30,980
Uh...

3085
01:55:30,980 --> 01:55:31,520
Um...

3086
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:32,180
And...

3087
01:55:32,180 --> 01:55:33,140
Honestly...

3088
01:55:33,140 --> 01:55:33,900
Um...

3089
01:55:33,900 --> 01:55:34,740
Wait I...

3090
01:55:34,740 --> 01:55:35,040
Oh yeah!

3091
01:55:35,540 --> 01:55:38,920
I didn't purposely avoid the monster question guys.

3092
01:55:39,060 --> 01:55:40,000
I actually forgot.

3093
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:44,000
I...

3094
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,620
I actually forgot.

3095
01:55:46,280 --> 01:55:46,880
Um...

3096
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:48,240
What was the original question?

3097
01:55:48,660 --> 01:55:49,880
Let me look back at it.

3098
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,340
Just so I can answer.

3099
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:52,620
Um...

3100
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:52,720
I think...

3101
01:55:52,720 --> 01:55:52,980
Um...

3102
01:55:53,720 --> 01:55:54,080
Correctly.

3103
01:55:54,900 --> 01:55:55,620
Alright.

3104
01:55:55,860 --> 01:55:56,780
Where is it?

3105
01:55:57,960 --> 01:55:58,680
Um...

3106
01:55:58,680 --> 01:56:00,180
Next C!

3107
01:56:00,380 --> 01:56:01,540
Someone says...

3108
01:56:01,540 --> 01:56:01,920
Are you...

3109
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:03,020
She said...

3110
01:56:03,020 --> 01:56:03,740
Are you saying...

3111
01:56:03,740 --> 01:56:05,600
You aren't into any monsters?

3112
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:08,620
All I'm saying...

3113
01:56:08,620 --> 01:56:09,760
Is that...

3114
01:56:17,460 --> 01:56:18,980
All I'm saying...

3115
01:56:18,980 --> 01:56:19,800
Is that...

3116
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:20,860
Fuck.

3117
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:21,260
Okay.

3118
01:56:23,980 --> 01:56:24,700
That's it.

3119
01:56:24,700 --> 01:56:25,240
I'm done.

3120
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:25,580
I'm done.

3121
01:56:27,460 --> 01:56:28,180
That's...

3122
01:56:28,180 --> 01:56:29,040
That's it.

3123
01:56:29,080 --> 01:56:35,220
Anyway, as always everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3124
01:56:35,480 --> 01:56:39,460
And if you stayed up for me, head to bed.

3125
01:56:39,780 --> 01:56:42,040
Cause you deserve it.

3126
01:56:42,180 --> 01:56:43,960
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

3127
01:56:44,500 --> 01:56:45,560
Bye guys!

3128
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:48,080
Bye!
