1
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,940
Well, we're back.

2
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,740
We're... we're back.

3
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,920
We're...

4
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,740
Dude, I haven't played since...

5
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,200
Since 3 p.m.

6
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:03,940
But...

7
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,880
We're back.

8
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,480
We're here.

9
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,260
I've been playing since 3 p.m.

10
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,920
And we're gonna keep going until...

11
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,380
Oh my gosh, whoops, I realized.

12
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,320
Okay, the chat should not be here then.

13
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,660
I only put chat here because like...

14
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,680
Um...

15
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,920
Oh, maybe I should put chat here.

16
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,200
And then the alerts...

17
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,000
Oh, I get it.

18
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,260
The alerts on the other side.

19
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,860
So the reason why I'm moving them around is because I realized...

20
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,800
Um, this is where the kill feed is.

21
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,220
So like...

22
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,260
Oh, wait, Hela's free.

23
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,560
So the right side is where the kill feed is.

24
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,480
And I realized that's like hard to see and everything.

25
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,000
So I'm just like, oh, maybe I should put on the other side.

26
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,880
All right, we're gonna do triple support.

27
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,320
We have to do Adam.

28
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,400
Okay, guys.

29
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,860
Okay, so like the reason why I didn't stream until now is because I was like, I gotta get back.

30
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:56,740
GM1?

31
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,380
I lost GM1 and I've been trying to get GM1 for a while.

32
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,700
And now I got GM1 back.

33
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,740
So I was like, now I do the stream.

34
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,040
And now that I'm...

35
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,340
Oh my gosh, I'm sorry.

36
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,460
Now we can stream.

37
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,180
And then we're gonna do it so that we don't end until...

38
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,680
Until we're eternity.

39
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,980
We're locked in.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,360
We're so locked in.

41
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,200
Come on, thank you for the five gifts.

42
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,540
Thank you, senor.

43
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,800
Thank you for the Twitch Prime system.

44
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,960
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

45
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,380
Five wins.

46
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,960
Bro, what the fuck?

47
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,880
What are you thinking, dude?

48
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,440
Yeah, oh my god.

49
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,200
Alright.

50
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,840
It's fine, we can do this.

51
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,720
Alright, we're locking in.

52
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,960
We actually have to try really hard.

53
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:52,640
I'm gonna be...

54
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,560
I can't be like super interactive, guys.

55
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,800
Like, I actually...

56
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,680
This is why I played...

57
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,480
Like, I didn't stream because like, I'm not locked in when I'm streaming.

58
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,640
So I was like, okay, I gotta focus up right now.

59
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,360
I gotta be so focused.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,340
Guys.

61
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,680
Okay, that's nice.

62
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,120
That's fine, I'm so locked in.

63
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,040
Come on, we can...

64
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,220
We can just walk up, right?

65
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,020
That's fucking right, guys.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,560
Just five games.

67
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,340
Just five games.

68
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,020
We can do it.

69
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,320
I get it now.

70
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,160
Okay, I might...

71
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,820
If I'm desperate enough, I might even start comming.

72
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,300
If I'm desperate enough.

73
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,520
We'll see.

74
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,920
We'll see how desperate I am.

75
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,060
I'll even talk and chat.

76
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,420
Yeah, no, fuck that guy in particular.

77
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,100
Oh, wait.

78
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:56,920
Not me.

79
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,680
There we go.

80
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,580
Okay, because there's like...

81
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,560
We need like...

82
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,520
We have three supports.

83
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,020
I am not getting the heal...

84
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,080
Getting my ult right.

85
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,740
Oh, no!

86
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,500
What the fuck is this, man?

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,560
If I'm desperate enough.

88
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,300
If like...

89
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,320
We're at a point where I'm like...

90
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,700
Okay.

91
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,360
All right, we need a win.

92
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,560
I will fucking communicate with my team.

93
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,740
I am that desperate.

94
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,060
I am so desperate.

95
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,160
I'm GM1.

96
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,500
I need my eternity and then I'll be happy.

97
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,040
And I'm gonna lose eternity tomorrow.

98
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,220
And then it's gonna be a cycle of abuse.

99
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,640
And I'll do it all over again.

100
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,560
Oh my god, I need Mac to like...

101
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,000
Let me heal.

102
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,620
Give me his like...

103
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,460
Head so I can like fucking give a snowflake.

104
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,800
Oh, there's no snowflake for you, I guess.

105
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,160
Give it to the Namor.

106
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,660
He's more important now.

107
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,900
All right.

108
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:01,760
All right, Namor.

109
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,840
Don't worry.

110
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,020
He has...

111
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,060
He's taking damage, so that's fine.

112
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,580
All right.

113
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,620
Come on, kill her!

114
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,280
Kill her!

115
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,840
Oh my god.

116
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,280
I guess we don't kill her.

117
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,760
Kill him though.

118
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:19,620
Kill him!

119
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,000
Oh my god, he's so low.

120
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,480
Thank god.

121
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,920
Okay, that's fine.

122
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,960
Triple support is actually so fucking scummy.

123
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,880
Nobody just dies.

124
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,100
There's still 12 more days.

125
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:31,580
All right.

126
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,880
The only way it will...

127
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,240
Okay.

128
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,780
Hey, any like...

129
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,000
I just gotta do this right away.

130
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,140
Get four pro players.

131
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:45,280
If only I was a millionaire with 30k people watching me.

132
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,800
And I could just get four fucking pro players to stack with me.

133
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,660
If only that I would.

134
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,760
But I also would get stream sniped to fucking hell.

135
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,860
Which I've already...

136
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,860
I'm getting stream sniped.

137
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,120
That'll be fine.

138
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,600
All right, there we go.

139
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:12,960
All right.

140
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,440
Dance, everybody.

141
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,820
Also, I'm not doing the scroll wheel because it's buggy as fuck.

142
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,400
Um, I know the scroll wheel tech.

143
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,700
But it's...

144
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,920
There's a...

145
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,460
There's a chance...

146
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,740
There's a chance if you do the scroll wheel tech that it's gonna stay on damage.

147
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,160
And like, that's happened to me for two games already.

148
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,180
And that's why I'm not doing it.

149
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,100
Because, um...

150
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:37,500
Come on!

151
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,220
Yeah, so like...

152
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,180
Yeah, it's bugged right now.

153
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,000
And that's why I'm not...

154
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,480
I'm not doing the scroll wheel.

155
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,060
I know, like...

156
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,800
I know the tech.

157
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,040
I have the tech on.

158
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,640
Um...

159
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,720
I have it binded.

160
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,760
Uh, but they actually...

161
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,420
Like, that has not happened to me yesterday.

162
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,920
Because I've been doing that a lot yesterday.

163
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,500
But today, I've actually...

164
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,140
Like, when I started doing it, like the last...

165
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:00,540
Uh...

166
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,900
The last, like...

167
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,400
Like, today.

168
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,220
Just starting today.

169
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,080
I would have it stuck on damage.

170
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,160
And it would, like...

171
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,500
It would be on heals.

172
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,380
Like, I would see it on heals.

173
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,140
And then, like, um...

174
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:11,700
But it would...

175
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,620
It'll be on damage.

176
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,940
Like, people will die in my ult.

177
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,240
And then, like, the thing is...

178
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,020
I manually...

179
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,140
I stop scroll wheeling.

180
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:17,920
And then, like...

181
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,200
You know, when I see people not being healed even though I'm on heal.

182
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,500
I try to reset it by being on...

183
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,060
By manually pressing Q instead of, like, using my scroll wheel.

184
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,640
And it would still be stuck on damage until the ult is over.

185
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,580
So, like, that's why I don't use the tech.

186
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,140
Um...

187
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,540
I was like, yeah, it's not worth it.

188
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,820
Like, like, but...

189
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,400
Because, like, this is, like, maker...

190
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,360
This... The ult is, like, actual make or break.

191
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,040
And if I fuck up the ult, like, once or some shit...

192
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,300
There you go.

193
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,500
I started the...

194
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,800
Oh, you forced it?

195
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,600
I got him one HP.

196
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,820
What the fuck do you mean you did that?

197
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,960
I did that.

198
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,880
Okay, we gotta kill that Hella though.

199
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,960
Oh, I guess you're not...

200
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,880
I'm so sorry.

201
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,800
I thought I could block it.

202
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,400
I guess you're not fucking living from that.

203
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:05,940
All right.

204
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,180
Oh, I need to reload my hands.

205
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,460
Gotta reload my hands.

206
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,980
I love reloading my hands.

207
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,220
Woo!

208
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:14,980
Okay.

209
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,220
I'm just going to put it on mack right now.

210
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:20,560
All right.

211
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:23,760
Bye.

212
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,680
I don't really want to use my ult yet.

213
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,650
I want to use it...

214
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,190
My ult as a defensive thing and Mantis ult as aggressive.

215
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,050
Because, like, we don't...

216
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,890
All right, I'll use it just in case.

217
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:34,870
All right.

218
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,170
Live, everybody!

219
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:37,630
Live!

220
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,190
And then I'll do damage manually.

221
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,070
That's right.

222
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:43,570
Live!

223
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,130
Okay.

224
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,650
Yeah, it lasted just a day.

225
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,150
And the people are still doing it.

226
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:53,470
I'm happy that it's not common knowledge because people are still doing it.

227
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:53,950
So that...

228
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,210
Because I'm playing Luna.

229
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:05,230
So, like, if people are still doing it, then, like, it's the enemy team that's doing it, you know?

230
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,710
It's the enemy Luna that's fucking up.

231
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,710
So I'm fine with that.

232
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,410
I'm fine with the enemy Luna fucking it up.

233
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:15,270
Like...

234
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,530
That's fine.

235
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:17,750
Hey, guys!

236
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,530
Hey, guys!

237
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,270
Hey, guys!

238
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,570
There's still that Captain America that I froze earlier.

239
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:22,850
Oh, whoops!

240
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,450
Accidentally woke him up.

241
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,150
I didn't think he was actually going to wake...

242
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:26,950
Okay.

243
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:32,770
There you go.

244
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:33,410
I'll kill him.

245
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:34,170
Yeah.

246
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,970
Also, Raccoon, thank you for the...

247
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,610
Thank you for the...

248
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:39,590
It's great.

249
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:39,950
Thank you.

250
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:40,630
Thank you.

251
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:45,290
Yeah, they're griefing themselves because I'd be the one playing Luna anyway on my own team.

252
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,310
Yeah, so, like, as long as other...

253
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:55,110
The enemy Luna is still doing the scroll wheel tech, I'm fine with it because there's a chance that...

254
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,070
There's a chance that...

255
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,470
They're gonna have the bug versus me.

256
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,110
So, I don't do it.

257
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,510
Yeah, I don't do the scroll wheel.

258
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,690
I don't know why they...

259
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:09,530
I mean, obviously, we all know why they patched it because it's so fucking broken.

260
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:10,850
Oh, my God.

261
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,050
Also, Neko, thank you for the raid.

262
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:13,390
Thank you.

263
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:13,690
Thank you.

264
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,390
Hello, everybody.

265
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:19,610
My name is DokiBrain and I usually stream on YouTube, but today I'm streaming on Twitch because I need eternity.

266
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,230
I need eternity, guys.

267
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,910
I need eternity.

268
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,830
So, like, my ego and my...

269
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,950
It's not for you, it's for me.

270
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:37,910
The scroll wheel tech is basically when you're ulting, you do...

271
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:41,150
It gives you damage and heal output at the same time.

272
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:48,110
So, instead of, like, swapping between heals and damage, if you use the scroll wheel to swap, it would be, like, super fast.

273
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:52,010
So, you get both heals and damage at the same time.

274
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:55,810
But it's bugged to the point where, like, it'll be stuck on damage.

275
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,250
So, like, you can't do anything.

276
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,430
You can't change it to heal until the ult is over.

277
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,830
And you have to do it yourself.

278
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,910
So, like, that's why, like, uh...

279
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,690
Put on Namor for now.

280
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:18,850
You know, the bad thing about 3 support is that support ult takes fucking forever to get for...

281
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,410
Because there's three of us.

282
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,070
Whoa, Namor!

283
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,230
Don't worry, I'm healing you from here.

284
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:27,650
All right.

285
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:28,750
Raccoon, no!

286
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,090
Rocket Raccoon!

287
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,790
Oh my god!

288
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,430
Okay, I got her.

289
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:40,510
At least.

290
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,690
Oh my god.

291
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,490
Where's Namor, anyway?

292
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,590
Oh, oh, look at me!

293
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,090
Look at me!

294
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,890
Look at me, please!

295
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:50,870
Okay, I don't need you!

296
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,090
Just go DPS, I guess.

297
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,890
Just... just DPS, I guess.

298
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,710
Just keep losing the DPS fight, too.

299
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,390
Like, you're not her.

300
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,270
Like, you're so lucky I was healing you.

301
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,850
You were so fucking dead.

302
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,030
You're actually not her.

303
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,030
If you were not getting pocketed by me, you would have lost.

304
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:15,690
All right.

305
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:17,910
Yeah, I'm on Twitch.

306
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:22,090
I streamed most ranked grinds on Twitch other than that one time yesterday.

307
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,430
People were so...

308
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,310
I don't know how, but apparently...

309
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:26,490
What is it?

310
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,310
BSP tweeted about me...

311
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,590
Like, the God of War Marble Rivals shit.

312
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:41,630
And then it turned into a fucking debate about VTubers spending too much time doing just chatting streams.

313
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:42,970
But then I'm just like...

314
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,010
I'm like, I wasn't even talking.

315
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,490
I wasn't even...

316
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,290
I was playing Marble Rivals!

317
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,070
They're like...

318
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,390
It turned into a debate about like...

319
00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:00,190
Are VTubers spending too much time doing Zatsudans instead of playing the game?

320
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,730
And I was like, bro, I was...

321
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,750
I was not talking.

322
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,730
That's for sure.

323
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,110
Where am I gathering to?

324
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:14,810
There you go.

325
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:15,570
Okay.

326
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,110
Oh my god, you fucking cheated.

327
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:20,870
Oh.

328
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:21,750
Oh my god.

329
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,310
Oh my god.

330
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,010
Guess we use this now.

331
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,130
They have Psylocke.

332
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,370
Alright.

333
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,310
Alright, I gotta run.

334
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,050
Because that insta kills me.

335
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,250
Alright, there we go.

336
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,130
Fuck a raccoon, I guess.

337
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,590
I am scared.

338
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,550
Alright, there was a reason why I was scared.

339
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,370
Oh wait, what the fuck?

340
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,090
Oh my god!

341
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:44,450
Fuck!

342
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:44,650
Okay.

343
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,590
There we go, she's dead.

344
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:47,630
Alright.

345
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,210
Yeah, but I thought that was cool.

346
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,390
It turned into a debate about it.

347
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,790
And I was just like, I'm just playing.

348
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,550
And then like, people actually got mad at that.

349
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:04,430
And then like, I saw someone commented on YouTube be like, if you're just gonna play a different...

350
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:08,650
Like, if you're just gonna play a different game versus what's on the title, just go back to Twitch.

351
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:09,690
Like, and I was like...

352
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,890
I did it one time!

353
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,970
One time is all it takes.

354
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:26,490
One time is all it takes to turn them into a hater.

355
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:32,790
I was like, bro, and it was just because I wanted to get GM1 back.

356
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,230
It's all it takes.

357
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,150
Where the fuck is this Captain America?

358
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,610
He's fucking throwing his shield at me.

359
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,390
Did he die?

360
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,970
That tweet was a banger.

361
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,190
Where is that Captain America?

362
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,990
You betrayed our trust.

363
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,910
I still played God of War!

364
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,190
I fucking knew it.

365
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,910
I knew there was a...

366
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,510
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

367
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,090
Guys.

368
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:09,690
Guys.

369
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:11,970
Come on, guys.

370
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,090
Just look at him.

371
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,070
Oh, shit.

372
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,390
If I stand under him...

373
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,490
There we go.

374
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:25,250
We'll never...

375
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:27,950
Yay!

376
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,570
Even though...

377
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,710
Okay, I was actually pretty locked in.

378
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:39,530
Like, I was...

379
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,430
I don't know how.

380
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,450
I'm fucking...

381
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,010
I don't know how I multitasked that.

382
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,410
Like, like...

383
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:47,010
I locked in.

384
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:47,730
I was fucking...

385
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,110
I felt like I was fucking around.

386
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:54,050
But I was also hitting, like, the nastiest freezes and, like, shots.

387
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,270
I don't know how I do it.

388
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,750
I'm just naturally gifted.

389
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,050
What can I say?

390
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,070
Azu and Mink, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

391
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:01,910
Thank you, thank you.

392
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,250
I really appreciate it.

393
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,250
That's true.

394
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,550
I was looking at chat too.

395
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,970
I was definitely looking at chat while I was playing.

396
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,690
It's just that easy.

397
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,150
To be fair, I could play Luna on autopilot now.

398
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,330
Like, legitimately.

399
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,930
Like, I played her so...

400
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:26,050
I have way too many hours on Luna.

401
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,710
I have way too many fucking hours right now on Luna.

402
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:35,430
That can actually, like, autopilot on her.

403
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,630
How many hours?

404
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,910
50 plus, at least.

405
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,210
At least 50 plus hours.

406
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,490
On Luna herself.

407
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,090
I also...

408
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,230
I finally...

409
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:47,970
I learned how to play.

410
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:49,210
Atom now.

411
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,250
Because Atom's, like, so fucking broken.

412
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:52,490
Hello?

413
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,690
Okay, but I'm banning Hawkeye right after.

414
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,110
Because, like, Atom's meta now.

415
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,330
Everybody's playing, like...

416
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:00,710
Uh, Luna.

417
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,670
Uh, Luna, Mantis.

418
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,650
And if Luna's banned, it's Mantis, Atom.

419
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:05,950
Oh, what?

420
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,830
Oh, is this guy an Atom main?

421
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,590
All right, I hope he fucking plays.

422
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,630
Yeah, you're done for.

423
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,430
But...

424
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,930
I know, I saw the mod.

425
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,710
But, like, um...

426
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,690
I saw the mod.

427
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,390
But, like, I'm worried about it...

428
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:27,310
People banning, like, my account getting banned.

429
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,690
Because, uh, they see it as an anti...

430
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,690
Like, uh, because of anti-cheat.

431
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,170
That's what I'm worried about.

432
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:33,810
That's why I don't...

433
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,430
I'm not... I really want to use it.

434
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:38,150
But I'm really worried that, um...

435
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:43,570
I'm really worried, uh, that, like, installing mods would consider...

436
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,930
Like, bannable for rank.

437
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,810
Yeah, that's why I don't use any mods.

438
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,810
I don't use any, like, mods that replaces the models and stuff.

439
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,010
Because anti-cheat is, like, so...

440
00:18:55,010 --> 00:19:00,090
Because, like, I feel like anti-cheat in general can get you, like, banned for, like, the craziest shit.

441
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:01,610
Like...

442
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:03,210
Yeah.

443
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,450
That's why I don't use any.

444
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,090
I wanted to, like...

445
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:08,930
Because I wanted...

446
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:13,050
There was a mod on Nexus Mods where you can change the cart...

447
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,790
To Thomas the Tank Engine.

448
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:15,710
And I thought that was the...

449
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,630
I thought that was the funniest shit.

450
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,910
I was like, oh man, I wish I could...

451
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:24,330
I wish I could change it to Thomas the Tank Engine.

452
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,670
Because it looks so funny.

453
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:29,830
I was like, oh my god, I want Thomas the Tank Engine in my game.

454
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:32,450
Like...

455
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,750
It looks so good.

456
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,310
If you go to Nexus Mods, you can find it.

457
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:38,670
Okay, I got locked in again.

458
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:39,630
Alright.

459
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,510
Also, I'm not in VC.

460
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:46,870
Because, like, I feel like I personally locked in more when I'm not in VC.

461
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,330
But that's just me.

462
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:48,950
I don't know.

463
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,090
I'll go in VC if I have to.

464
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,310
But I'm sorry, Mac.

465
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:54,930
I'm sorry, Mac.

466
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:57,690
You can talk to your own chat and I can talk to my chat too.

467
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,590
What the fuck?

468
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:01,910
That was so fast.

469
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,850
What the fuck?

470
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,190
He's already here.

471
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,750
Oh my god!

472
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,270
Where's my heals?

473
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:13,610
Where is she?

474
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:18,310
She looked away from the Mantis!

475
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,570
Oh my god.

476
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:21,710
Okay, that's fine.

477
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,150
Okay.

478
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,510
The Mantis actually looked away.

479
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:27,930
Oh my god.

480
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,070
While I got fucking died.

481
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,490
Holy shit.

482
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,090
I'm sad now.

483
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:37,170
The Mantis wasn't even looking at me.

484
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,350
Holy shit.

485
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,870
Oh my god.

486
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:54,050
Guys, I'm worried about this game, guys.

487
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:59,810
I'm worried about this game, guys.

488
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:06,990
Ever since our Mantis, the first thing he does is not look at the support duo.

489
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,830
It doesn't make me feel...

490
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,230
Why did you run away?

491
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,810
I'm not feeling great about this game, guys.

492
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:15,630
I'm...

493
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:23,790
I'm not feeling great about this game.

494
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,010
Oh my god.

495
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,830
Like, I don't understand why she didn't look at me.

496
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,250
I was like, I'm right here.

497
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,390
I'm right beside you.

498
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,210
Okay, how close is she?

499
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,250
Okay, she has hers first.

500
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,890
I wonder why she has hers first.

501
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:51,630
Okay, I need to use this because I don't want to reload my hands.

502
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,850
It's way too risky to reload right now.

503
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,750
Alright, we won our very first fight.

504
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,670
I'm so happy.

505
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:01,670
Oh my god.

506
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,910
We won our first fight.

507
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,750
Let's fucking go.

508
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:06,990
Alright.

509
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,730
I'm just jealous of getting healed.

510
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:11,830
Oh my god.

511
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:12,990
I mean, wouldn't anybody?

512
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,890
We gotta take care of each other.

513
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,190
Supports gotta look after each other.

514
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,230
If we don't, like, what do we have?

515
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:25,610
I want to, like, position myself here, but I'm worried that...

516
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,620
I'm worried I'm gonna get...

517
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,990
I'm really...

518
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,310
There you go.

519
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,030
I swear, I SWEAR!

520
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:35,630
God, that freeze should have lasted a lot longer!

521
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,050
You fucking know it!

522
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:40,830
You know that freeze should have lasted fucking at least four seconds!

523
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:41,950
I...

524
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:49,610
Oh my god.

525
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:50,170
Alright, let's go.

526
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,630
Let's fight this one, too.

527
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,530
Let's go.

528
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,190
Let's fucking go.

529
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,150
Alright.

530
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:02,370
Alright.

531
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:03,410
I got worried.

532
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,650
I don't know if I should have used it.

533
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,110
I don't think I should have used it, actually.

534
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:07,230
Oh my god.

535
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:12,090
I got really worried we were gonna lose that fight there because he was, like...

536
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,850
Because our Mantis ult was gonna run out.

537
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,290
So, we'll see.

538
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,590
They have Psylocke ult now for it.

539
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:23,190
Ooh, they definitely have Psylocke ult.

540
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,090
I swear to god!

541
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:25,750
I swear!

542
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,530
Okay, I got solo ulted.

543
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,090
That's fine.

544
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,650
Thor was gonna fucking kill me anyway.

545
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,610
Thor was gonna fucking kill me.

546
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,050
There was no reason.

547
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:40,730
Let's start.

548
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,810
I'm gonna back out now.

549
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:43,890
Whoa!

550
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,630
I don't think we can tell that.

551
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:46,250
Okay, that's this.

552
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:46,970
I don't have ult.

553
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,330
Get off, Thor!

554
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,810
I can solo tank!

555
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:57,710
Damn.

556
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,610
What if he's a Thor player?

557
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:01,770
You don't know that.

558
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:04,150
You don't know that.

559
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,010
Oh, he's dead.

560
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:06,350
You don't know.

561
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,050
Chicken soup could just be a Thor main.

562
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:11,850
I like how he's like, let me solo tank.

563
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:12,990
I can take them on.

564
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,990
Is he gonna- yeah, he's gonna stay on Thor.

565
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,610
I mean, I think it's fine.

566
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:22,590
If he's a Thor one trick, we just gotta play around him.

567
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:23,750
Like, what can we do?

568
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,070
Alright.

569
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:26,170
Goodbye.

570
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,230
Come on.

571
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:33,910
Thor it.

572
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:35,450
Okay.

573
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,000
Oh my god, alright.

574
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,840
I have to use this to stabilize.

575
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,140
Oh guys, guys!

576
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,500
Oh my god!

577
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,140
You could have helped him!

578
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,080
Okay.

579
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,580
Nope.

580
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,500
I froze somebody.

581
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:56,880
I don't know who.

582
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,180
Oh.

583
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,460
Alright, that's cool.

584
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,260
I'm gonna send this randomly out.

585
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,420
Maybe I'll hit something.

586
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,160
That's fine.

587
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,320
Alright, two minute and thirty- that's cool.

588
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,540
I don't know.

589
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,840
I'm not feeling that confident about this game.

590
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,680
We have no more support ults here.

591
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,760
I don't know.

592
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,160
I don't know, guys.

593
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:32,760
We're always- I feel like we're always lacking in the support ults here.

594
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,840
Which is making me a little- Oh my god, I can't heal you!

595
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,420
I can't heal you!

596
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,680
You're in the dog!

597
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:48,680
Okay.

598
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,080
That's okay, we got pick.

599
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,780
He went into the fog!

600
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,300
What am I supposed to do?

601
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,020
What am I supposed to do when you're in the fog?

602
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,820
When you're in the fog, I don't see anything.

603
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,080
I don't see anything!

604
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,900
She's coming over!

605
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,800
She's coming over!

606
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,880
She actually fucking saw me!

607
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,720
Help!

608
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,300
No!

609
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,520
She moved so- I was so close to the spot!

610
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,820
I was literally one step away from the spot!

611
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,580
Oh my god.

612
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,000
The Lunatec is bugged.

613
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:48,900
The Lunatec is bugged to the point where like- Where if you do it, there is a chance- There is a chance that it will stick- They will stay to damage.

614
00:26:50,460 --> 00:27:01,680
So like, I've had that happen to me twice within like- In like two- Yeah, I've had that happen to me twice like during the first five games that I played.

615
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,060
Um...

616
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,580
So like, that's why I don't do it anymore.

617
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:10,320
I have it binded, but like- It worked yesterday.

618
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,780
Yesterday, it was like working.

619
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,080
And then today, they might have like- Podfixed it.

620
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,100
Because it's in a- It's like a tech abuse.

621
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,280
Um...

622
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,560
It's not like act- Like...

623
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,660
It's like- What's it called?

624
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,760
Um...

625
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,160
Um...

626
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,720
Because it's not intentional.

627
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,840
It's not intentional.

628
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,180
It's too much of a risk.

629
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,620
I had like- I lost a game.

630
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,720
I lost one game for it because of it.

631
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,100
Because like, uh...

632
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,540
We could have won the push.

633
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:45,160
But then because they ulted me and I was doing scroll wheel tech.

634
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,760
And then we all died.

635
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,600
And we lost the game.

636
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,440
And they're like, why are you on damage?

637
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,640
And it like literally- Like on my screen, um...

638
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,360
Nobody was getting healed.

639
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,820
Like I could see no one getting healed.

640
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,940
So I was like, oh.

641
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,180
Oh, it's definitely bugged.

642
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:10,900
So they- You can see- You can see that it's on, uh...

643
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,730
Okay, our Neymar was actually doing shit though.

644
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:17,950
So like, I'm worried here.

645
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:21,830
OH MY GOD!

646
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,090
THIS ALWAYS HAPPENS TO ME!

647
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:33,370
I hate being there because I can't- I always like fucking accidentally walk off.

648
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,110
And this always happens to me.

649
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:37,250
And I need to like make sure I don't walk off.

650
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:42,250
Because I don't know how to not do that.

651
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,290
Okay, this is not the fight we're supposed to take, guys.

652
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,350
This is definitely not it.

653
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,610
I always fall off when I'm there.

654
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,870
Because I always feel like, uh...

655
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,130
Go back to Rocket.

656
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,170
When you mean go back to Rocket...

657
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:01,590
You mean Mantis?

658
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,570
We don't have Luna Mantis?

659
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:08,070
Okay.

660
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:19,330
Yeah, if Imod can make the command about Luna and just be like, she knows the tech but it's bugged out now.

661
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:23,010
It's bugged where it stays on damage if you do it sometimes.

662
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,530
Yeah, like, um...

663
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:30,430
I don't think this team is a good team.

664
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:38,210
I'm literally just getting ran down by- Me too.

665
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,090
Alright.

666
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:45,030
She dashed right into my right click and that's fine.

667
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,150
I'll take that.

668
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:50,070
I don't know why we have Black Panther.

669
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:51,470
Um...

670
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:53,430
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

671
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:55,770
Honestly, it was more useful on Mantis.

672
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:00,510
It was definitely a lot more useful.

673
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,410
He's fine, right?

674
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,570
You're so fine, Bong.

675
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,390
You're so healthy.

676
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,370
I have to do this.

677
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,750
I know I was gonna get, like, exploded.

678
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:18,230
I had a feeling.

679
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,310
I had a feeling they were gonna explode me.

680
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:27,450
I saw three people ran at me and I was like, yeah, I ain't dealing with that.

681
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:32,010
Uh oh.

682
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,390
This is it, Mac.

683
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:44,650
This is your time to learn.

684
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,390
Learn Wolverine.

685
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,490
I know how much you like learning.

686
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:54,830
Oh my- Why did you fly up there?!

687
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,390
I just did.

688
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:56,910
Starlord won.

689
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:57,570
Starlord won.

690
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,210
Starlord won.

691
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,810
Oh my god.

692
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:06,470
Captain one, two, player is everybody.

693
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,230
I- Oh, I don't know.

694
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,510
I killed the fucking Syla.

695
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:12,950
Like...

696
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,790
Where is everybody?

697
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:18,070
He stays as I 1v1 the Syla myself.

698
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:20,870
I did my job.

699
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,980
Holy shit!

700
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:30,900
Okay.

701
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,300
That's crazy.

702
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,660
Good luck, everybody.

703
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,860
Is he gonna follow me?

704
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,220
I need a fucking heal.

705
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,860
Oh my god.

706
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,520
Yeah, we all need heals.

707
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,520
Oh my god.

708
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:58,960
Okay, so I didn't- It's Bud where it stays on damage sometimes.

709
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,640
You didn't right put that in.

710
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,000
Hello.

711
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,380
Hello.

712
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,280
Yeah, that's right.

713
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,040
That didn't feel great, did it, Thor?

714
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,860
That's fucking right.

715
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,820
Do that again.

716
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,840
But don't, please.

717
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,300
I don't know if I'll hit it next time.

718
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,400
But don't do it again because I actually don't know if I'll hit it.

719
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,240
Sometimes I pop the fuck off when it comes to freezes.

720
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,720
And then sometimes I like watch the ice walk away.

721
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:38,700
Okay, I don't know if like- I don't know if that one- That like insta kills you if he lands on you.

722
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,100
Even on Luna ult.

723
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,180
Because there's some ults where- Oh my god, no.

724
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,160
This is longer.

725
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,220
This is so much longer.

726
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,220
Oh my god, that's fine.

727
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,260
Guys, that's not fine.

728
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,120
Please, he's assembling.

729
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,080
Please, just shoot him.

730
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,620
Okay, if you're too close- Okay, so it's basically like Magneto ult.

731
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:07,900
Because I couldn't tell.

732
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:12,080
I was like- I never got full killed by a Thor ult in Luna ult before.

733
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:16,900
But it's also because I've never tried to be like in the center, you know?

734
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,360
Because like I know like what it does.

735
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,080
Alright, somebody kill her.

736
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,060
No one?

737
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:24,880
Alright, that's fine.

738
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,780
So I never wanted- You know, I don't want to fucking risk it, you know?

739
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,380
If it does.

740
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,860
I never tried it yet.

741
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,880
And I don't think I want to.

742
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,340
Okay, so it's basically like Magneto ult.

743
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:41,780
Alright.

744
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,660
Oh my god, that's a hate crime!

745
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,880
He chose to kill me instead of the three other squishies in front of him.

746
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,880
That's fine.

747
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,060
That's fine.

748
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,540
That's fine.

749
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,560
Alright, here we go.

750
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,840
I don't know about this team.

751
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,820
I don't know.

752
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,600
I feel like their team is just- I mean, yeah.

753
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,820
I think their team is just- yeah.

754
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,960
I think their team is just better, honestly.

755
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,360
I think- I think- okay, Mac.

756
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,520
Oh,

757
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,600
that's huge!

758
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,080
But like, everybody's in the ult.

759
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,640
So like, I don't know.

760
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,540
That was very unlucky.

761
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:49,700
Alright.

762
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,880
You guys all want to be part of the show?

763
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,260
You know?

764
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,060
Like, would you guys like to be in my ult instead of like, in them?

765
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,520
Alright, not Dr. Strange though.

766
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:02,940
Nope.

767
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,440
Dr. Strange wants to stay deep.

768
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,160
Four people deep into the team.

769
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,420
Like, you know.

770
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,800
It is what it is.

771
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,340
It really is what it is.

772
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:16,900
I don't know why he was still like, by himself over there.

773
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,700
But that's alright.

774
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,020
That's cool.

775
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,020
I do so little damage when it comes to like, the sleep.

776
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,520
Like...

777
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,980
There we go.

778
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,840
I did that.

779
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:36,860
How?

780
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,020
What do I do?

781
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,300
What do I do?

782
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,640
I was at the very end!

783
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,750
What can I do?

784
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:54,870
I think I'm dying on point.

785
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,150
Wait, I need help on point.

786
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,010
I need- I need point.

787
00:35:59,170 --> 00:35:59,730
I need help point.

788
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:02,490
Oh my god.

789
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,790
Oh my god, please.

790
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:06,870
Please.

791
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:13,350
Alright, I believe in you guys staying on point.

792
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,810
Do not get off point.

793
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:18,650
Alright.

794
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:23,870
Why are you healing the 1v1?

795
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:27,970
It's a good pick.

796
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,290
We should keep the pressure up.

797
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:34,870
Door one, door one, door main, door one, door one, door one, door fucking one.

798
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:38,370
Tracer's on ult, she's on it.

799
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:40,950
Do not C9!

800
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:49,290
Oh my god, they almost C9'd and I'm like...

801
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:56,290
Oh my god, they actually almost C9d.

802
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:56,970
They actually almost C9.

803
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:00,110
I was gonna fucking freak out.

804
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:07,050
I was gonna freak out.

805
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:09,830
They actually almost C9.

806
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:15,230
I was like, guys, I need to stand back so I can heal.

807
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,770
Oh my god.

808
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:23,390
Oh my god.

809
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:27,250
I almost saw them all walk off.

810
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:30,950
I almost saw them all walk off the point.

811
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,030
I don't wanna stand on high ground.

812
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:38,010
I'm not standing on high ground.

813
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:44,890
I'm gonna stand next to the healer so I don't insta-fucking die.

814
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:53,270
Oh wait, okay, we're attacking first.

815
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:58,910
I don't know, I don't think we should TP.

816
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,570
TP never works, I feel like.

817
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:03,890
If we TP, like, send us back, like...

818
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:08,610
Like, back behind the high ground, you know what I'm saying?

819
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,070
Not inside that little place.

820
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:11,670
Oh my god.

821
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:14,590
Outside where the little fucking chairs and shit are.

822
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:15,450
Potatoes.

823
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:17,350
Alright.

824
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:23,050
If anybody asks me about the fucking scroll wheel tech, just give them the thing.

825
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:24,890
Just do !luna.

826
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:28,110
So we don't have to explain ourselves over and over again.

827
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:30,530
I'll put it on...

828
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:32,510
I don't know who I should put it on.

829
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:35,590
I guess a Black Panther for now.

830
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,410
Let's TP, let's TP, let's TP.

831
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:38,590
We're gonna TP, alright.

832
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,730
Let's hope I don't walk off again.

833
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:42,550
I'm gonna put it on tank then.

834
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:46,670
I don't know about playing slow, but okay.

835
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,640
I'll reload my hands.

836
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:19,110
All forwards, reloading.

837
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:22,650
Alright.

838
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:23,870
Oh my god.

839
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:24,910
Killed one.

840
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,430
I'm keeping pressure over here.

841
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:29,790
Alright.

842
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,230
Here we go.

843
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:37,210
Yo Panther, if you keep just going in and just, like, just...

844
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:39,050
You don't even have to kill anything, just stay alive.

845
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,710
I can just keep... I can just make it.

846
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:42,090
Yeah.

847
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:46,970
I swear to god, if you guys stepped off the point, I swear to fucking god.

848
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:48,130
I...

849
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:55,070
I swear to god, I'm gonna stand here and hope that you guys don't step off the point.

850
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:57,610
That's all I hope for.

851
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:01,830
That's... Oh my god, it's already a little bit gone already.

852
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:02,970
It's...

853
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:05,890
It's already...

854
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:10,490
I don't know how, but it's...

855
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,150
It's already a little bit gone.

856
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:17,070
Careful, careful, careful, careful.

857
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:19,390
Okay nice, get out, get out, get out if you can, get out.

858
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:20,050
Okay.

859
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:21,230
I'm back, I'm back.

860
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:21,910
Just wait it out.

861
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,450
We should walk on this, we should walk on this.

862
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,650
We should focus Mantis so she can stay alive.

863
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:30,850
Oh my god, big, big, big.

864
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,350
I'm teleporting, come on.

865
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:33,550
Stay on, stay on, stay on.

866
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,450
I'm trying to stay on.

867
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:34,830
I killed everyone.

868
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:35,910
Oh my god.

869
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:36,710
No!

870
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:40,510
And the Psylocke got me!

871
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,990
I was so close!

872
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,010
No!

873
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,190
That is crazy.

874
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:50,030
I was so close!

875
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:52,990
I mean, they just took more damage than they did though.

876
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,450
Oh my god.

877
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:57,030
Yes.

878
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:58,710
That's just all it is.

879
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,470
We just shit on them too hard in the first fight.

880
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:02,250
Are we good for this?

881
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,630
Yeah, we're not at all.

882
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,120
Should we run the double tank?

883
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,540
Oh my god.

884
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,540
They had two supports!

885
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,780
I was so lucky to even have 97!

886
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,640
Oh my god.

887
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,120
It was so hard to get support ult.

888
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,700
It was so hard.

889
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,420
I was so close.

890
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,880
I literally was 3%.

891
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,020
I did everything I could to build as much ult as I could.

892
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:41,200
Oh my god.

893
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:52,270
Alright, here we go.

894
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,830
Here we go.

895
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:05,790
I feel like I'm gonna get fucked up.

896
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,630
Maybe this Rocket Raccoon will heal me.

897
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:09,650
The Mantis definitely did not last time.

898
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,330
Alright, here we go.

899
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:14,250
I'm scared.

900
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:16,290
I'm a little scared, guys.

901
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,510
I want to believe, but I don't.

902
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:19,150
I won't.

903
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:22,470
Oh.

904
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:37,820
Oh my god.

905
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:48,170
Come on.

906
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,210
Oh my god.

907
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:51,810
I'm coming over.

908
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:52,470
I'm coming over.

909
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,530
Get over here.

910
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:56,950
Kill the Thor.

911
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:57,370
Kill Thor.

912
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:57,690
Thor.

913
00:42:58,730 --> 00:42:59,690
I'm trying.

914
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:00,810
Please kill me.

915
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:01,930
Please.

916
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:03,950
I'm trying so hard.

917
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,430
Oh my god.

918
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:10,150
I'm on you.

919
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:10,890
I'm dead.

920
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:11,270
I'm dead.

921
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:14,250
Focus the healers, bro.

922
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:15,650
Please.

923
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:22,190
Why did we not?

924
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:23,730
That is fucking crazy.

925
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:25,050
Why did we not kill him?

926
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:25,290
Bro.

927
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:27,130
Like, strange.

928
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,010
You gotta like not fucking die there, man.

929
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:31,370
I mean, we could still hold this.

930
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:36,850
Okay.

931
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:40,370
I'm putting on Strange.

932
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:43,350
I'm so close to support.

933
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:47,370
I have heal over my ult.

934
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:51,490
Oh, that's good.

935
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:51,930
That's good.

936
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:57,850
They have support ult.

937
00:43:58,530 --> 00:43:59,590
But they have Psylocke ult.

938
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:07,230
Oh my god.

939
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:10,290
We have to kite.

940
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:10,710
Just kite.

941
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:11,250
Stay together.

942
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:11,990
Kite this one.

943
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:12,510
Stay together.

944
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:12,970
Please.

945
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:15,830
Oh, I can't.

946
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:18,670
Kill the Mantis.

947
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:19,150
Forward.

948
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:20,030
There's a lot of height.

949
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:20,970
One HP.

950
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:21,530
One behind.

951
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:21,950
One HP.

952
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:22,930
Kill Strange.

953
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:24,150
Please.

954
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:25,990
Almost damage.

955
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:28,230
They have Mantis ult.

956
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:29,490
One HP.

957
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:29,890
One HP.

958
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,490
One HP.

959
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:34,070
Bro.

960
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:39,670
Right there.

961
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:40,750
The cop.

962
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:41,170
The cop.

963
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:41,810
The cop.

964
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:47,820
Heal your name.

965
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:48,520
Heal your name.

966
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:48,700
Heal your name.

967
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,500
Keep me up.

968
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:49,740
Keep me up.

969
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:52,480
It's fat.

970
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:55,480
It's not fat at all.

971
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,780
I did not kill that.

972
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,280
Oh, Psylocke.

973
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:02,160
Please.

974
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:04,780
Please.

975
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:08,540
Please.

976
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:09,100
Please.

977
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,480
Oh my god.

978
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,000
We're gonna lose because I was alive for so long.

979
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,940
I was actually...

980
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:24,440
I was alive for so long.

981
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,700
What do you want from me?

982
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,580
I was alive for so long.

983
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:39,840
I literally walked backwards and then he just kept chasing.

984
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,400
Oh my god.

985
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,360
Oh my god.

986
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,220
I actually...

987
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,540
I did so much there.

988
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,560
Oh my god.

989
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,300
Oh my god.

990
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,360
I was like...

991
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:07,800
We just didn't have a Mantis.

992
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,500
We didn't have a Mantis.

993
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:11,700
What am I supposed to do?

994
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:12,780
No Mantis.

995
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,540
Also, X1 and...

996
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,100
Alright, thank you for the Twitch five.

997
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:17,520
Thank you.

998
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,280
Thank you.

999
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,360
Alright, if we lose the next game...

1000
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:25,540
Um...

1001
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:26,740
We'll...

1002
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,080
We'll start comming.

1003
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,460
We'll start comming if we don't...

1004
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:42,740
If we lose this game.

1005
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,200
We'll actually talk.

1006
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,140
Oh my god, we have a Mantis player.

1007
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,900
Like, it's already an improvement.

1008
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,160
Oh my god.

1009
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,500
As in, I will talk in-game.

1010
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,960
You know, our Namor is actually insane.

1011
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:00,180
Like, he gets so much value.

1012
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,800
Also, Cup, thank you for the tier one.

1013
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:05,140
Also, Transi, thank you for the tier one sub.

1014
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,120
Thank you.

1015
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:10,580
Uh...

1016
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:11,740
Bruce Banner.

1017
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,240
That's fine.

1018
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:14,000
Where is he?

1019
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,540
Nobody else does it, so I'll do it.

1020
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:18,060
And the second one, I'll do Hawkeye.

1021
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,600
I don't know if they'll do Hawkeye.

1022
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:21,560
Sometimes they don't.

1023
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,560
So I just don't.

1024
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:27,930
We got a new estranged.

1025
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:30,730
We do not have Hawkeye.

1026
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:31,650
Yeah, that's good.

1027
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:34,230
We will have Hawkeye then.

1028
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:36,750
Uh...

1029
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:37,670
But yeah, it was...

1030
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:39,610
Also McSpanky, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

1031
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:40,570
Thank you, thank you.

1032
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:42,030
I really appreciate it.

1033
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:44,850
Oh my god.

1034
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:47,570
I still... I can't believe it.

1035
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:49,730
I can't believe it.

1036
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:51,490
We could've won that.

1037
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:52,170
We could've...

1038
00:47:58,270 --> 00:47:59,890
Oh my god.

1039
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:00,590
If...

1040
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:01,490
If like...

1041
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:02,770
If...

1042
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:03,450
Uh...

1043
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:04,450
If they...

1044
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:05,290
Uh...

1045
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:06,730
If they only like...

1046
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:07,350
Oh my god.

1047
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:09,430
If they like turn around and kill the cap.

1048
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:10,910
Oh my god.

1049
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:12,090
That would've been so winnable.

1050
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:14,830
Literally just needed to kill the cap.

1051
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:16,250
Cause like...

1052
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:19,350
No matter where I position, he's just gonna Mach 7 run at me.

1053
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:20,730
I literally freeze him too.

1054
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:21,990
And then like...

1055
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:22,790
What am I supposed to do?

1056
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:23,730
Just run...

1057
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:26,150
Just...

1058
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:27,730
Just run.

1059
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:34,650
Run to my team that's getting hit.

1060
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:38,650
Like no matter how far away I run back, he's just gonna chase me.

1061
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:43,230
Alright.

1062
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:45,110
You see it does...

1063
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:46,840
Sometimes I do this, but sometimes people...

1064
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:49,510
Uh...

1065
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:50,930
Sometimes people just...

1066
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:51,530
Don't look.

1067
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:55,570
I got zero peel.

1068
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:57,510
I literally froze all my divers.

1069
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:00,670
That's literally what I did.

1070
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:03,030
I just froze everybody that died at me.

1071
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:05,170
Like I had zero peel.

1072
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:09,750
I'm just lucky that I got the freezes.

1073
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:11,050
Not luck.

1074
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:12,110
It's sketchy knocks.

1075
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:12,550
Yeah.

1076
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:19,340
Jesus Christ.

1077
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,120
Everybody's taking so much damage though.

1078
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:23,880
Oh...

1079
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,600
Oh my...

1080
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:29,940
Oh!

1081
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:31,480
You're gone!

1082
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,520
Okay, guys!

1083
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:39,340
Let's just walk away from the healers.

1084
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,680
All of you.

1085
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:44,740
All of you guys.

1086
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,720
Just walk away from us.

1087
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,040
I'm just gonna help marry that.

1088
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:50,820
We're on the right side?

1089
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:51,240
Okay.

1090
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,020
Alright.

1091
00:49:55,880 --> 00:50:00,540
I hope Starlord knows that we can't heal them like this.

1092
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:01,620
Alright.

1093
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:05,950
Alright.

1094
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:07,010
Oh!

1095
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:08,330
I'm just gonna do the clap.

1096
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:11,630
I'm just gonna clap because they're all in the line.

1097
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:13,490
And that's really useful for me.

1098
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:15,290
Alright.

1099
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:18,930
Oh!

1100
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:19,790
Can't.

1101
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:21,170
Oh!

1102
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:22,190
There we go.

1103
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:22,830
That's fine.

1104
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:23,950
I have my ult anyway.

1105
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:25,650
We'll have Mantis ult next.

1106
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:27,570
We'll have Mantis ult next.

1107
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:28,650
I just...

1108
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:31,750
I just want you guys to be alive.

1109
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:33,850
And then I walk away.

1110
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:35,910
Okay.

1111
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:37,050
I didn't think...

1112
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:37,390
Okay.

1113
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:39,810
We should not Mantis ult that.

1114
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:42,130
Now we have no defensive ult.

1115
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:47,170
We're using that as an aggressing, but we don't have...

1116
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:48,370
Oh!

1117
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:49,150
There we go.

1118
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:50,250
I messed up my freeze.

1119
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:51,650
Hahaha!

1120
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:54,910
Oh, nice!

1121
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:55,910
Doesn't matter!

1122
00:50:56,370 --> 00:50:57,890
They still died.

1123
00:50:58,810 --> 00:50:59,550
Thank god.

1124
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:00,930
They don't need support.

1125
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:05,430
I killed him.

1126
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:07,270
Oh, thank god.

1127
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:12,030
Alright.

1128
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:15,470
That's fine.

1129
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:22,850
I didn't even pay attention to be fair.

1130
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:26,570
Oh god.

1131
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:28,730
Oh!

1132
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:29,730
Oh!

1133
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:30,910
I'm freaking out.

1134
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:33,010
When I start shaking, I'm freaking out right now.

1135
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:36,610
I'm trying not to, but like...

1136
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:38,090
Why am I staying like this?

1137
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:41,890
Oh my god, please.

1138
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:45,290
Oh!

1139
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:49,170
He'll be fine.

1140
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:50,630
He is not fine.

1141
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:52,490
He is not fine.

1142
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:55,990
Goodbye.

1143
00:51:58,710 --> 00:51:59,110
Goodbye.

1144
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:01,190
I'm sorry.

1145
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:03,030
I have to live.

1146
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:06,090
I already have my ult.

1147
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:07,390
I had no reason to heal you.

1148
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:13,710
There's no reason for me to keep you alive.

1149
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:14,570
I already have my ult.

1150
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:17,430
It's all about survival at this point.

1151
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:19,210
I have to reload my hands.

1152
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:19,650
I have to reload.

1153
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:21,730
I have to reload my hands, but it's okay.

1154
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:22,430
We're all okay.

1155
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:24,450
We're all healthy.

1156
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:27,110
Alright, Mantis first.

1157
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:30,570
Mantis is always first, but I accidentally used my...

1158
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:34,230
My main ult earlier because I was scared.

1159
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:36,310
I was so scared.

1160
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:38,050
Yay!

1161
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:42,670
Yay!

1162
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:48,150
I am...

1163
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:48,750
Oh!

1164
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:49,910
Shit!

1165
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:54,390
Don't you...

1166
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:55,390
No, he has a reset!

1167
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:56,230
He has a reset!

1168
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:57,330
He has a reset!

1169
00:52:57,450 --> 00:52:57,750
Please!

1170
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:02,870
Please!

1171
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:04,110
No!

1172
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:07,630
Mantis!

1173
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:14,470
Our Mantis died.

1174
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:17,510
I couldn't do anything after that.

1175
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:22,250
It was over for me unless I froze him, but I couldn't freeze him.

1176
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:24,610
Mantis, you could have...

1177
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:29,690
Mantis, you could have slept him.

1178
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:32,210
Root's out of position.

1179
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:40,670
Did he fuck it up?

1180
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:47,210
I don't know.

1181
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:49,570
Nope.

1182
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:54,290
Okay, I'm locked in.

1183
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:58,370
Who used ult?

1184
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:00,850
It's my bad.

1185
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:05,750
Who used ult?

1186
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:08,850
Who is it?

1187
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:20,590
I'm just getting melted now.

1188
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,830
Yeah, that solo thing.

1189
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:24,590
I'm just gonna...

1190
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:27,570
Here we go.

1191
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:29,970
Oh my god, he was one!

1192
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:35,390
I'm sad.

1193
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:37,390
It was actually one.

1194
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:40,870
It was actually one.

1195
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:41,810
I'm so sad.

1196
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:46,270
Alright, that's fine.

1197
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,170
That's not fine.

1198
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:53,310
Oh my god, I was gonna be like, where is my...

1199
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:55,290
Okay.

1200
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:00,190
Alright,

1201
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:06,190
we still have...

1202
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:08,250
We can still fight this with my ult.

1203
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:12,950
Yeah, I didn't ult because I was thinking we have one last fight.

1204
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:16,950
Oh, never mind.

1205
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:20,530
Never mind.

1206
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:21,990
Somebody else has to touch.

1207
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:25,450
That sucks.

1208
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:30,730
Alright, I don't know who's gonna be touching it.

1209
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:33,050
But it's not us for sure.

1210
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:33,690
Oh wait, what?

1211
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:39,350
Why didn't they touch?

1212
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:41,890
The car was not even that far!

1213
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:44,870
Including which side you're on.

1214
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:47,770
I'm Luna Snow.

1215
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:48,270
What?

1216
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:52,430
It wasn't even that far and I kept touching it.

1217
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:53,070
It's okay.

1218
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:54,810
Everything is fine.

1219
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:57,550
Everything is fine.

1220
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:01,770
Alright, I'm getting ready to communicate.

1221
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:06,910
I'm so ready to communicate with people now.

1222
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:08,730
Not now, but like...

1223
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:09,790
Does anyone else play tank?

1224
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:12,210
Um...

1225
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:16,430
I'm ready to communicate in the next game.

1226
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,890
I'm so ready.

1227
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:25,470
Someone goes sub.

1228
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:31,830
I guess I don't pick anyone else.

1229
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,590
Oh, we don't have a Mantis player.

1230
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:37,170
How do we not have a Mantis player?

1231
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:41,450
It's lost anyway.

1232
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:44,210
Alright.

1233
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:49,150
Okay.

1234
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:52,810
No, we have.

1235
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:54,110
Oh yeah, no.

1236
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:56,910
These hours are always mostly DPS players to be fair.

1237
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:00,270
I'm not ready.

1238
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:01,230
I'm not.

1239
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:03,670
I'm ready to talk next game.

1240
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:04,930
Not really.

1241
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:07,030
I'm not ready to talk next game either.

1242
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:09,250
They're portaling.

1243
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:11,610
Oh, they portal.

1244
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:22,510
I'm a little scared to be up there, so I'm not going to be up there.

1245
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:25,610
Just drop down if you need.

1246
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:28,770
That's me.

1247
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:30,390
I need...

1248
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:30,790
That's me.

1249
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:32,090
I need to drop down.

1250
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:33,410
That's me.

1251
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:36,270
I dropped down because I need...

1252
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:40,330
I dropped down because I need...

1253
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:46,590
Oh, oh, oh, please.

1254
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:50,510
Oh my god.

1255
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:51,890
Nice, girl.

1256
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:53,890
On point, on point, on point.

1257
00:57:56,770 --> 00:57:57,710
Please peek me.

1258
00:57:58,890 --> 00:57:59,370
Please.

1259
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:04,590
Watch the weapon.

1260
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:13,690
Please, please, please, please.

1261
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:14,410
Adam, please.

1262
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:19,190
Oh my god.

1263
00:58:19,310 --> 00:58:21,530
He didn't even soulbonded.

1264
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:26,450
Oh my god, Adam.

1265
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:31,690
I just needed literally 1%.

1266
00:58:38,370 --> 00:58:39,930
Oh my god.

1267
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:41,790
I'm sad.

1268
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:43,690
I'm so sad.

1269
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,030
I'm so sad.

1270
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:50,810
If I had a soulbound, I'm so sad.

1271
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:56,810
Alright.

1272
00:58:57,810 --> 00:58:59,190
Here we go.

1273
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:02,810
Here we go.

1274
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:04,970
Here we go.

1275
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:08,230
You awesome houses.

1276
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:09,810
Alright.

1277
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:11,850
Alright.

1278
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:12,210
Alright.

1279
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:14,610
I don't know how.

1280
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:19,710
Alright.

1281
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:21,130
We have one fight.

1282
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:23,570
Let's defend for four minutes.

1283
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,030
I kink.

1284
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:27,910
I don't...

1285
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:29,310
I have never opened...

1286
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:31,130
I've only commed when I know it's a streamer game.

1287
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:32,750
But like, at this point, I'm desperate.

1288
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,150
I'm desperate.

1289
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:37,330
I'm desperate.

1290
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:44,230
Please soulbond us.

1291
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:45,890
Please, you just need to soulbond us.

1292
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:46,710
Just soulbond.

1293
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:47,750
Just keep soulbonding.

1294
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:53,480
God.

1295
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,100
Oh my god.

1296
00:59:59,000 --> 00:59:59,500
Oh.

1297
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,800
Oh my god.

1298
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,220
Final score.

1299
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:04,940
One.

1300
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:05,420
Two.

1301
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:06,160
Two.

1302
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:12,020
This is crying back to back.

1303
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:12,540
Wow.

1304
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:15,900
No, Mack.

1305
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:17,560
Don't.

1306
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:19,260
No, he's good.

1307
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:21,920
He's an actual good player, Mack.

1308
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:24,220
I don't want him to farm us.

1309
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:28,700
Mack, I don't want him to farm us.

1310
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:29,220
Mack.

1311
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,040
Oh my god.

1312
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:32,620
Alright.

1313
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,240
It's time to...

1314
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,640
It's time to bound.

1315
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,480
I'm bounding it.

1316
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,760
I'm gonna bound.

1317
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:40,380
I'm gonna do it.

1318
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:42,340
Oh, I couldn't do it.

1319
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,320
I'll do it soon.

1320
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,140
I'll do it soon.

1321
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:49,040
I'm sad that...

1322
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:50,300
I'm sad...

1323
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,860
Oh wait, he's there again.

1324
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:52,940
He's there.

1325
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:53,840
Why didn't you...

1326
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:54,560
Oh my god.

1327
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,520
Now they're gonna throw.

1328
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:57,800
Now they're gonna throw.

1329
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:05,220
I'm banning Mantis then.

1330
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,220
Oh my god.

1331
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,060
Oh no, he's gonna throw because...

1332
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,080
Oh my god.

1333
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:11,280
Why?

1334
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,200
I'm gonna lose my GM, what?

1335
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:21,980
He's not free though.

1336
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,760
He's really good.

1337
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:28,100
This guy's actually really good on DPS.

1338
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:28,720
He's...

1339
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,000
He's really good on Namor.

1340
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:36,000
That's why I'm like, no, I can't avoid him.

1341
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:42,260
Because you know he's gonna try his absolute fucking best when he's against us.

1342
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:48,960
So like...

1343
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,100
So I'm like...

1344
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:51,940
Oh my god.

1345
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,120
So I'm sad.

1346
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:55,740
I'm sad.

1347
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,120
I wish he did avoid us.

1348
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:59,160
So like, he wouldn't throw.

1349
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:02,660
He's...

1350
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:05,760
A lot of good players are just egomaniac assholes though.

1351
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:06,560
That's...

1352
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,040
Oh my god, why didn't we ban Mantis?

1353
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,200
Why didn't we ban Mantis?

1354
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:13,400
Okay.

1355
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:17,060
Oh my god.

1356
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,340
I've won with this guy before.

1357
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:19,320
Before like...

1358
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:20,400
Before...

1359
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,420
On my team.

1360
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:22,320
I've won with him.

1361
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:22,860
Because that's how...

1362
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:23,520
I know he's good.

1363
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:24,480
Because he like...

1364
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,520
He's actually like...

1365
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,740
Clutch it up as Namor.

1366
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:30,800
As Ashley.

1367
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:31,880
That's why I'm like...

1368
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:32,120
I'm...

1369
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:32,860
Oh my god.

1370
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:33,780
Because he hates...

1371
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:35,300
He hates Mac.

1372
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,660
So he's gonna throw now.

1373
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:40,860
I mean, if he's throwing, I'll report him I guess.

1374
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,460
But like, we'll see how it goes.

1375
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:43,780
We'll see.

1376
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:44,860
That's usually how it goes.

1377
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:47,440
If you fucking say shit that like...

1378
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,420
Pisses the other person off.

1379
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:49,680
They'll be like, alright, I'm gonna throw now.

1380
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:50,480
Alright.

1381
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:53,360
Oh my god.

1382
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:54,560
Widow can be good.

1383
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:55,480
But like...

1384
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:56,700
I...

1385
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:58,960
I don't know...

1386
01:02:58,960 --> 01:02:59,760
If he's like...

1387
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,460
If he can do it without Mantis.

1388
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:03,700
That's the thing.

1389
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:06,480
Because like, Mantis is so...

1390
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:08,560
All heroes.

1391
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:08,980
Yes.

1392
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:13,540
Wait, no.

1393
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:14,420
I want all heroes.

1394
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:15,000
Fuck!

1395
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:15,720
Okay, I can't.

1396
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:18,120
I was trying to figure out how to find my stuff.

1397
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:19,600
Alright.

1398
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:20,820
We'll see how this goes.

1399
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,340
Yeah, but he usually picks Widow to troll.

1400
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,040
That's what Triforce does.

1401
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:29,080
He only does it to troll.

1402
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:33,800
Isn't actually...

1403
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:34,460
Mac.

1404
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:35,400
Who?

1405
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:36,180
Mac!

1406
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:42,040
I wish I was able to bound my stuff in time.

1407
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:51,790
We just have no front pressure right now.

1408
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:53,590
Except for our Punisher.

1409
01:03:53,590 --> 01:03:55,050
Our Punishers are only frontline.

1410
01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:56,450
Oh, thank god.

1411
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:04,110
Yeah, fuck off.

1412
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:06,130
Oh, I missed the freeze though.

1413
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:10,850
Oh no.

1414
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:15,610
Go, Magneto!

1415
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:16,870
Live for us!

1416
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:19,670
Magneto, you have to live!

1417
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:20,610
Magneto!

1418
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:22,910
You have to live for us!

1419
01:04:22,990 --> 01:04:24,550
Magneto, I have to look away though.

1420
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:27,450
I have to look away for now.

1421
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:29,470
But Magneto, you gotta live.

1422
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:32,450
Magneto, as the solo tank here.

1423
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:34,630
I'm gonna make sure you're alive.

1424
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:37,630
But that's really all I can do, honestly.

1425
01:04:38,350 --> 01:04:39,390
Oh my god.

1426
01:04:41,290 --> 01:04:44,030
I wish I could look at you guys.

1427
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:45,770
Like...

1428
01:04:45,770 --> 01:04:47,010
Like, what do we do?

1429
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:47,850
We're just...

1430
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:49,890
We're stuck here.

1431
01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:54,210
Live.

1432
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:56,390
Live.

1433
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:58,210
Live.

1434
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:04,350
Live.

1435
01:05:09,010 --> 01:05:10,230
Are we... are we alive?

1436
01:05:13,790 --> 01:05:15,070
Are we...

1437
01:05:15,070 --> 01:05:16,550
Oh my god, he's gonna be alive.

1438
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:18,310
He's gonna be so alive.

1439
01:05:19,430 --> 01:05:19,730
Please.

1440
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:22,770
The one time, I'm like on the point.

1441
01:05:23,490 --> 01:05:24,650
Alright, they got...

1442
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:26,690
We have literally zero frontline.

1443
01:05:31,050 --> 01:05:32,350
We have no...

1444
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:35,310
We have no frontline pressure.

1445
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:39,770
Oh my god, the play close.

1446
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:40,990
I'm scared for a Magneto.

1447
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:43,530
I'm gonna play close because I'm actually scared for a Magneto here.

1448
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:46,670
I don't know if, like, he's gonna actually live.

1449
01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:49,210
We'll just get away.

1450
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:53,370
I...

1451
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,850
I did everything I could.

1452
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:56,670
I did everything I could.

1453
01:05:57,790 --> 01:05:58,430
I...

1454
01:05:58,430 --> 01:05:59,250
Please.

1455
01:05:59,630 --> 01:06:01,870
Please get on the point while we live here.

1456
01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:03,850
We're gonna live here.

1457
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:04,390
Okay?

1458
01:06:04,910 --> 01:06:05,230
Please.

1459
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:06,390
Just...

1460
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:07,250
Oh, okay.

1461
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:07,950
You know what?

1462
01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:09,710
I'm still okay.

1463
01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:10,530
For now.

1464
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:20,300
I'll just be here.

1465
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:22,180
We got off point!

1466
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:24,820
We had one job!

1467
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:25,760
Just

1468
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:31,050
kill me.

1469
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:31,790
Just kill me.

1470
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:31,870
Okay.

1471
01:06:36,050 --> 01:06:36,650
Alright.

1472
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:40,910
Alright, that's fine.

1473
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:43,350
That's fine.

1474
01:06:44,930 --> 01:06:46,010
We're so fine.

1475
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:49,170
Guys, I...

1476
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:51,030
We can get back GM one, guys.

1477
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:52,450
I believe.

1478
01:06:53,390 --> 01:06:54,630
We can get it back.

1479
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:00,850
We can get it back.

1480
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:02,110
I believe in us.

1481
01:07:02,110 --> 01:07:04,410
You know, it's gonna be okay.

1482
01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:10,350
It's gonna be so okay.

1483
01:07:16,430 --> 01:07:18,150
I believe in us.

1484
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:18,890
You know?

1485
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:20,570
I'm gonna...

1486
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:21,410
I'm gonna ask...

1487
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:23,450
Dodge this Q because I'm pretty...

1488
01:07:25,350 --> 01:07:25,910
Dodge...

1489
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:27,290
This Q...

1490
01:07:27,290 --> 01:07:29,150
Because I'm pretty sure...

1491
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:31,190
He's gonna throw...

1492
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:32,410
When he sees your name.

1493
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:37,550
But try when he sees you...

1494
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:40,150
Sees you against us.

1495
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:48,910
I'm...

1496
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:50,810
I'm not dealing with...

1497
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:53,270
I know he's gonna fucking try so hard.

1498
01:07:53,630 --> 01:07:56,610
This is why I don't be toxic to people, like...

1499
01:07:56,610 --> 01:07:57,890
In game.

1500
01:07:58,150 --> 01:07:59,450
It's like I only...

1501
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:01,450
I'm only toxic on stream.

1502
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:02,630
Because I'm...

1503
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:04,350
I don't know exactly why.

1504
01:08:04,590 --> 01:08:07,510
Because there's actions to your consequences.

1505
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:12,170
And I'm unfortunately just a bystander.

1506
01:08:15,210 --> 01:08:17,810
It's like, yes, he might be getting picked.

1507
01:08:18,150 --> 01:08:22,410
But it's not the most ideal character to play.

1508
01:08:23,410 --> 01:08:24,630
In general.

1509
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:26,250
It's not...

1510
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:30,010
It's not really very ideal to play this character.

1511
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:31,230
Because like...

1512
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:32,730
I'm not...

1513
01:08:32,730 --> 01:08:34,050
I have to depend so much.

1514
01:08:37,690 --> 01:08:38,490
They'll be fine, right?

1515
01:08:38,670 --> 01:08:39,250
They are not.

1516
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:40,130
They'll be fine.

1517
01:08:40,270 --> 01:08:41,230
They're so fucking fine.

1518
01:08:44,230 --> 01:08:44,750
Please.

1519
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:45,590
Please.

1520
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:46,790
I...

1521
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:47,370
Please.

1522
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:48,490
Just kill him.

1523
01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:54,950
I'll be fine.

1524
01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:56,790
It's not fine.

1525
01:08:56,890 --> 01:08:58,030
But like...

1526
01:08:58,030 --> 01:08:59,530
That's all I can do.

1527
01:08:59,530 --> 01:09:00,390
Be positive.

1528
01:09:03,870 --> 01:09:04,670
Alright.

1529
01:09:06,790 --> 01:09:08,130
It's like literally...

1530
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:08,890
Literally...

1531
01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:12,390
You could play other characters and make more of an impact.

1532
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:15,790
That's why like...

1533
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:16,450
I'm worried.

1534
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:24,720
Alright.

1535
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:26,520
I'm just gonna...

1536
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:26,900
Okay.

1537
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:27,680
Slap.

1538
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:28,360
Slap.

1539
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:29,040
Slap.

1540
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:29,720
Slap.

1541
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:30,920
Slap.

1542
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:32,200
Slap.

1543
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:33,600
Slap.

1544
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:34,020
Alright.

1545
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:34,980
Stand on point, please.

1546
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:36,480
Alright.

1547
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:38,160
There we go.

1548
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:40,420
Stand on point, guys.

1549
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:41,100
Alright.

1550
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:41,780
Alright.

1551
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:42,420
That's fine.

1552
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:43,840
Stand on point, everybody.

1553
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:45,220
That's fine.

1554
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:45,680
I...

1555
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,420
I'll get the mines too, guys.

1556
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:47,960
That's fine.

1557
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,400
I'll stand on point for us.

1558
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:54,300
Please.

1559
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:56,780
That's fine.

1560
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:00,520
That's fine.

1561
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:01,980
He's one.

1562
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:02,760
Alright.

1563
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:03,800
I'm gonna fucking...

1564
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:03,980
Woah!

1565
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:04,820
Nice.

1566
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:07,160
There we go.

1567
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:09,460
That's fine.

1568
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:11,520
At least like...

1569
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:11,980
You know.

1570
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:13,740
Alright.

1571
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:14,640
At least our...

1572
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,020
This is a good Widow map.

1573
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:16,820
Thank God.

1574
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,300
Thank God this is a good Widow map.

1575
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:23,940
Alright.

1576
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:25,960
That's fine.

1577
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:28,800
I love Marvel Rebels.

1578
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,720
I love Marvel Rebels.

1579
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:31,780
Yippee!

1580
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:34,440
I love Marvel Rebels.

1581
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:35,200
I told you.

1582
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:37,120
He's like an insane player.

1583
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:38,760
He's so good.

1584
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:39,760
Like...

1585
01:10:46,930 --> 01:10:48,890
Like he's actually insane.

1586
01:10:52,810 --> 01:10:53,510
Alright.

1587
01:10:53,710 --> 01:10:54,290
There we go.

1588
01:10:57,850 --> 01:10:58,550
Yes.

1589
01:11:00,810 --> 01:11:02,330
But it's like less reliable.

1590
01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:06,610
Widow is like not really that reliable as a character.

1591
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:10,010
This is also a really good Widow map because there's so many angles.

1592
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:14,410
Now on this map, there's not a lot of angles for them to play around.

1593
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:17,830
So like...

1594
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:19,010
Oh my God.

1595
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:20,530
So it's a little scary.

1596
01:11:25,310 --> 01:11:26,610
I don't know what to do.

1597
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:28,350
I don't know.

1598
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:29,690
I don't know what to do.

1599
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:32,350
This is a scarier map now.

1600
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:34,790
This is a scarier map because...

1601
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:36,950
This is not...

1602
01:11:36,950 --> 01:11:37,750
Oh my God.

1603
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:38,770
He swapped up.

1604
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:39,970
He was like...

1605
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:43,090
Maybe he actually wants to win.

1606
01:11:43,350 --> 01:11:43,810
Guys.

1607
01:11:44,470 --> 01:11:45,010
Maybe he...

1608
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:48,430
Guys, you think he actually wants to win?

1609
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:50,890
No.

1610
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:51,430
Okay.

1611
01:11:51,530 --> 01:11:52,070
That's fine.

1612
01:11:52,690 --> 01:11:53,570
That's fine.

1613
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:59,230
Thanks for giving me false hope for like five seconds.

1614
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:00,790
I really appreciate it.

1615
01:12:00,970 --> 01:12:03,030
To feel like a little bit of happiness.

1616
01:12:04,190 --> 01:12:05,810
I really appreciate that.

1617
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:07,590
You know.

1618
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:09,770
Just...

1619
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:15,320
I really appreciate that.

1620
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:16,960
Guys.

1621
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:21,040
I'm glad I got to feel it for a second.

1622
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:21,700
You know?

1623
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:22,980
Just a little bit.

1624
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,260
Like, we could never cap.

1625
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,040
Oh no!

1626
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:31,120
I didn't know!

1627
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:32,940
No!

1628
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,020
I couldn't see him!

1629
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:42,440
Goodbye!

1630
01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:47,670
I didn't see him.

1631
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:48,910
He like was in the air.

1632
01:12:53,810 --> 01:12:54,950
You're alive!

1633
01:12:58,110 --> 01:12:58,830
Oh my God.

1634
01:12:58,850 --> 01:12:59,310
You're alive.

1635
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:02,190
You're actually alive.

1636
01:13:03,330 --> 01:13:04,170
That's crazy.

1637
01:13:06,970 --> 01:13:08,130
Oh my God.

1638
01:13:08,170 --> 01:13:08,970
You're alive.

1639
01:13:09,410 --> 01:13:11,250
How are you alive, Magneto?

1640
01:13:13,070 --> 01:13:14,790
Alright, I'm going to play around here.

1641
01:13:15,050 --> 01:13:18,170
I don't want to play like fucking into them.

1642
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:22,230
I don't know how our Magneto was alive there.

1643
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:23,770
Oh, they have Bruton out.

1644
01:13:24,770 --> 01:13:25,850
They're going to wall us off.

1645
01:13:26,650 --> 01:13:27,690
They're going to wall the Widow.

1646
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:31,370
Please.

1647
01:13:32,110 --> 01:13:32,390
No!

1648
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:33,870
Please!

1649
01:13:34,430 --> 01:13:35,410
I'm trying!

1650
01:13:35,650 --> 01:13:36,150
How?

1651
01:13:36,310 --> 01:13:37,210
I'm dancing!

1652
01:13:38,010 --> 01:13:38,570
Please!

1653
01:13:39,110 --> 01:13:39,790
God, please!

1654
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:41,230
Dance on point!

1655
01:13:41,230 --> 01:13:42,330
God, please!

1656
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:52,440
Aika, why am I the only one that understands the concept of the- He's just dying on my point.

1657
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:54,680
It's fine.

1658
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:57,160
It's okay.

1659
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,900
I might be the only one that understands what point is, but that's okay.

1660
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:03,660
That's okay.

1661
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:07,920
Like, someone's got to understand.

1662
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,400
I'm glad like one of us does.

1663
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:18,140
Okay.

1664
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:24,800
Okay, that's a little worrisome because...

1665
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:30,700
Yeah, I don't think this Magneto understands that you don't look.

1666
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:31,860
You don't peek.

1667
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:33,740
You don't peek!

1668
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,060
Don't peek him when he throws his rock!

1669
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:42,360
Oh, it was GM1.

1670
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:43,780
This is my demote game.

1671
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:47,080
This is actually my demotion game.

1672
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:52,730
And like, I'm...

1673
01:14:54,010 --> 01:14:55,770
I'm losing more and more confidence.

1674
01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:08,870
I'm losing more and more confidence as- Guys, please!

1675
01:15:09,550 --> 01:15:12,350
Why are you guys just up there?

1676
01:15:20,050 --> 01:15:21,090
What?

1677
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:24,990
I don't understand my team.

1678
01:15:27,230 --> 01:15:31,190
Why are you just up there?

1679
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:36,050
Just walk forward!

1680
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:38,830
Why are you just up there?

1681
01:15:43,970 --> 01:15:45,930
Please dodge his Q.

1682
01:15:48,070 --> 01:15:50,170
We've made enemies.

1683
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:05,580
We've made enemies.

1684
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:05,580
Goodbye.

1685
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:07,700
It was nice being GM1 for a second.

1686
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:11,060
It was nice being GM1 on stream.

1687
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:12,520
Oh, fuck yeah.

1688
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:14,980
Oh my god.

1689
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:19,220
Oh my god.

1690
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:20,060
That's okay.

1691
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:24,020
Oh, that's alright.

1692
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:26,320
I'm okay, guys.

1693
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,160
I'm okay, everybody.

1694
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:31,440
I'm alright.

1695
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:35,320
I'm so okay right now.

1696
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,340
Oh my god.

1697
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:40,360
It's okay.

1698
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:43,020
It's okay.

1699
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:50,610
I'm okay.

1700
01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:53,090
At least he had fun.

1701
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:55,230
He was fucking playing his heart out.

1702
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:58,390
But, like, I said that he's really good.

1703
01:16:58,590 --> 01:17:00,990
But that was not a Widow map.

1704
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:03,250
Like, the second one was a Widow map.

1705
01:17:03,650 --> 01:17:06,090
The first and third is not a Widow map.

1706
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:09,110
So, like, and we had literally zero frontline.

1707
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:14,330
Like, we had zero fucking frontline there.

1708
01:17:15,490 --> 01:17:17,010
Is he in-game or any?

1709
01:17:17,390 --> 01:17:18,250
Is he in-game?

1710
01:17:18,370 --> 01:17:20,190
I'm just gonna check just in case.

1711
01:17:21,010 --> 01:17:23,310
I swear to god if he's, like...

1712
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:23,950
I don't remember.

1713
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:25,570
His name was, like, Bog.

1714
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:26,810
But he's not even...

1715
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:27,990
Is he invisible?

1716
01:17:29,010 --> 01:17:29,930
Oh my god.

1717
01:17:29,970 --> 01:17:30,930
He's invisible.

1718
01:17:31,670 --> 01:17:33,290
Oh my god.

1719
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,060
No one was going forward.

1720
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:38,360
Oh, yeah.

1721
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:39,820
I gotta do the comms thing.

1722
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:42,880
I can't wait for people to yell at me because I'm a female.

1723
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,520
I'm so excited.

1724
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:54,400
I swear to god if I am going to, like, have...

1725
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:55,520
Okay, this is a new queue.

1726
01:17:56,180 --> 01:17:56,740
This is...

1727
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:57,580
Oh my god.

1728
01:17:57,620 --> 01:17:58,440
This is a new queue.

1729
01:17:58,600 --> 01:17:58,820
Okay.

1730
01:18:02,740 --> 01:18:06,300
He's actually invisible so you can't, like, dodge him.

1731
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:07,080
That's smart.

1732
01:18:07,780 --> 01:18:09,300
That's actually so smart.

1733
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:11,600
Alright, let me...

1734
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:12,820
I'm gonna push.

1735
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,500
I can't wait for them to yell at me.

1736
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,440
Guys, this is my favorite part.

1737
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:21,780
I love it when they yell at me.

1738
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:25,360
That's why I stopped using voice unless I'm a streamer lobby.

1739
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:28,920
Because when you're in a streamer lobby, they don't yell at you.

1740
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:36,280
Because they're like, I don't want to showcase that I'm misogynistic in front of, like, my favorite streamer.

1741
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:40,980
Like, that's the only reason why I'm okay.

1742
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:50,740
That's the only reason why I'm okay using mic when it's all...

1743
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:54,680
Like, when I'm playing with other... when there's other streamers in my game.

1744
01:18:55,780 --> 01:18:56,440
Or hello, whatever.

1745
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:01,840
Yeah, but then the streamers would protect me and be like, whoa!

1746
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:04,740
And then, like, that embarrasses them.

1747
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:09,800
But then, like, when I'm, you know, I'm like, oh, I gotta...

1748
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:18,730
That's why I don't... I don't talk on voice comms unless I'm in a streamer lobby.

1749
01:19:19,610 --> 01:19:22,810
Because then they'll be like, whoa, I can't be...

1750
01:19:22,810 --> 01:19:24,390
Oh, we don't have Mantis ban.

1751
01:19:26,970 --> 01:19:27,490
If...

1752
01:19:27,490 --> 01:19:30,890
Can we have Mantis if...

1753
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:33,490
Okay, I... fuck it, who cares at this point.

1754
01:19:33,930 --> 01:19:36,810
If he does bad, I'll just do, like, after we lose.

1755
01:19:37,090 --> 01:19:39,710
If we... if we don't do well.

1756
01:19:40,410 --> 01:19:41,450
And... I hope we're attack.

1757
01:19:42,430 --> 01:19:43,870
I hope we're attack.

1758
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:51,110
Oh, okay, wait, no, I hope we have attack.

1759
01:19:51,210 --> 01:19:52,490
Yeah, that's what I mean, I hope we have attack.

1760
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:53,710
Alright.

1761
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:57,090
Can you remember this is...

1762
01:19:57,810 --> 01:20:00,830
This is gonna be harder to press B.

1763
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:06,330
This is gonna be a little harder to press B.

1764
01:20:06,330 --> 01:20:09,610
Is there a control... Is there anything on control for Marvel Rivals?

1765
01:20:10,650 --> 01:20:11,030
Guys?

1766
01:20:11,730 --> 01:20:13,590
Is there anything on control for Marvel Rivals?

1767
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:18,030
It's gonna be easier to put any healing on control than B.

1768
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:19,770
I don't remember.

1769
01:20:21,170 --> 01:20:21,610
Alright.

1770
01:20:24,130 --> 01:20:25,010
Yeah, but...

1771
01:20:25,010 --> 01:20:26,110
The other team have...

1772
01:20:26,110 --> 01:20:29,530
But he has to fight... look at the other team's Mantis to be able to do it.

1773
01:20:29,670 --> 01:20:30,350
That's the thing.

1774
01:20:30,970 --> 01:20:35,070
I don't know if, like, he'll be able to look at the other Mantis in time.

1775
01:20:36,890 --> 01:20:39,110
Yeah, but, like, what about any supports?

1776
01:20:39,530 --> 01:20:40,210
I don't know.

1777
01:20:43,910 --> 01:20:44,550
Oh.

1778
01:20:46,190 --> 01:20:47,310
No, I'm wrong.

1779
01:20:48,090 --> 01:20:48,770
Alright.

1780
01:20:53,090 --> 01:20:54,490
Alright, that's cool.

1781
01:20:57,150 --> 01:20:59,210
Not gonna try and stand too close.

1782
01:21:03,290 --> 01:21:03,830
Oh.

1783
01:21:05,390 --> 01:21:06,770
Oh, you're gonna...

1784
01:21:06,770 --> 01:21:07,230
Whoop!

1785
01:21:07,610 --> 01:21:08,010
Alright.

1786
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:09,650
Okay.

1787
01:21:10,810 --> 01:21:11,970
That's cool.

1788
01:21:15,590 --> 01:21:17,550
There's, like, nothing to talk about.

1789
01:21:17,930 --> 01:21:18,810
People just die.

1790
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:25,050
Okay.

1791
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:35,420
We got a pick.

1792
01:21:41,570 --> 01:21:42,370
Alright.

1793
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,600
Oh, Psylocke behind me?

1794
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:56,560
Oh my god, please!

1795
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:04,100
I can't.

1796
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,700
I can't.

1797
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,360
Comms don't matter.

1798
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:15,820
Oh my god, I even said Psylocke behind me.

1799
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:17,780
He just let me die.

1800
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:20,260
How does her E work?

1801
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:27,360
She gives people this, and then if I heal somebody else, she heals, and if I heal her, she gets stuck with the healing.

1802
01:22:28,580 --> 01:22:29,900
It's just that easy.

1803
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:35,640
It's just that easy.

1804
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:41,320
I don't know how to comm with this team.

1805
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:46,020
Like, this team is so, like, everywhere.

1806
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:53,220
Okay.

1807
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:55,960
Okay.

1808
01:22:57,660 --> 01:22:59,060
I don't...

1809
01:22:59,060 --> 01:23:00,800
What do you want me...

1810
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:01,760
Okay.

1811
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:03,040
Oh!

1812
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,420
Oh, okay!

1813
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:15,000
Um...

1814
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:18,860
This team has to be the least team-five.

1815
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:21,600
I don't even need to comm with them, like...

1816
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:23,940
This...

1817
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:25,080
This...

1818
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:27,320
This is not a team.

1819
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:30,180
This is absolutely not a team.

1820
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:32,880
Like, what do I even say to them?

1821
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:39,520
Yes, it does.

1822
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:39,940
What?

1823
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:40,680
Yes, it does.

1824
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:41,740
It stacks, does it not?

1825
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:43,180
Oh, so did...

1826
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,040
It heals more when you have it on them.

1827
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:49,920
It feels like I'm healing more.

1828
01:24:03,450 --> 01:24:03,930
Oh!

1829
01:24:06,570 --> 01:24:07,090
Oh!

1830
01:24:07,910 --> 01:24:08,430
Please.

1831
01:24:09,270 --> 01:24:10,230
Please, look at me.

1832
01:24:11,110 --> 01:24:11,470
Please.

1833
01:24:12,350 --> 01:24:12,870
Please.

1834
01:24:13,030 --> 01:24:14,530
Oh my god, I'll heal myself.

1835
01:24:19,190 --> 01:24:19,710
Please!

1836
01:24:19,970 --> 01:24:20,870
Oh my god!

1837
01:24:22,890 --> 01:24:24,130
Oh my god, please!

1838
01:24:24,970 --> 01:24:25,490
Okay!

1839
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:29,970
Okay, it's fine.

1840
01:24:32,090 --> 01:24:32,990
It does.

1841
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:34,130
I'm pretty... I've done it.

1842
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:35,690
I feel like I've healed, like, a shitload.

1843
01:24:35,690 --> 01:24:39,750
Unless I'm fucking placebo-affecting myself.

1844
01:24:42,170 --> 01:24:42,830
I don't know.

1845
01:24:42,990 --> 01:24:43,770
Maybe it doesn't.

1846
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:45,350
And I was just a placebo effect.

1847
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:46,870
Please just jump.

1848
01:24:51,730 --> 01:24:53,010
That's crazy.

1849
01:24:55,130 --> 01:24:55,770
Like...

1850
01:24:57,550 --> 01:24:58,190
I'm...

1851
01:24:58,190 --> 01:25:02,210
But yeah, I'm just... I think I have to use voice to just get heals.

1852
01:25:02,770 --> 01:25:06,650
If he doesn't respond to, like, me spamming that.

1853
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:14,120
Oh my god!

1854
01:25:14,670 --> 01:25:15,520
I'm sorry.

1855
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:17,880
Oh my god!

1856
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:19,160
Okay, he's alive.

1857
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:23,340
Alright.

1858
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:25,980
That's why I put on the tank.

1859
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:27,180
For double the healing.

1860
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,120
I'm just... Okay!

1861
01:25:35,710 --> 01:25:36,060
Oh!

1862
01:25:36,180 --> 01:25:38,460
I heard... I heard... I heard the growl.

1863
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,360
I heard the growl.

1864
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:40,900
I...

1865
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,200
I heard...

1866
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:46,740
What?

1867
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:54,860
I hope we have Soulbond!

1868
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:55,660
I hope we have Soulbond!

1869
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:55,940
Oh!

1870
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:56,680
It doesn't matter!

1871
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,140
It doesn't matter!

1872
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:06,140
Oh my god.

1873
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:10,460
That's okay.

1874
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:13,040
I've accepted my fate on this game alone.

1875
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:15,100
Oh, now we have three supports.

1876
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:15,460
You know what?

1877
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:16,240
Three supports works.

1878
01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:19,080
I don't trust this Loki at all.

1879
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:22,900
After, like...

1880
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:28,600
I hope...

1881
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:29,280
Oh my god.

1882
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:32,580
Oh my god.

1883
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:33,000
Please.

1884
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:34,540
Please.

1885
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:39,400
Oh my god!

1886
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:46,970
Oh my god!

1887
01:26:49,850 --> 01:26:51,130
I know the...

1888
01:26:51,130 --> 01:26:51,930
He's here.

1889
01:26:55,050 --> 01:26:55,830
He's here.

1890
01:26:57,010 --> 01:26:57,870
He's here.

1891
01:26:59,910 --> 01:27:00,830
Oh my god.

1892
01:27:00,990 --> 01:27:01,350
Please.

1893
01:27:04,050 --> 01:27:04,910
Please!

1894
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:08,910
I guess I'll touch!

1895
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:17,100
I guess I'll touch!

1896
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:20,140
Oh my god.

1897
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:24,500
Alright.

1898
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:25,620
That's fine.

1899
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:29,320
This...

1900
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:32,040
This team is a team.

1901
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:33,820
It really...

1902
01:27:33,820 --> 01:27:36,320
It's definitely a team.

1903
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:42,000
It's...

1904
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:42,380
Yeah.

1905
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:43,980
I don't...

1906
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:44,460
Yeah.

1907
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:45,940
This...

1908
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:46,420
Yeah.

1909
01:27:49,820 --> 01:27:50,360
It's...

1910
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:51,780
It's a team.

1911
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:53,380
It's...

1912
01:27:53,380 --> 01:27:54,260
It's a team.

1913
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:56,920
I...

1914
01:27:56,920 --> 01:27:58,940
I can't cop with this team.

1915
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:00,820
Nobody is, like...

1916
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:03,320
Everybody is playing so split.

1917
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:06,580
There's, like, no point in, like, actually being a team player.

1918
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:09,040
To, like, communicate with them.

1919
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:10,860
They're all, like...

1920
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:12,080
They're all stupid.

1921
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:13,320
Like, I can't...

1922
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:14,480
I can't...

1923
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,520
I actually can't do anything with this team.

1924
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:19,480
Lord, thank you for tier one sub.

1925
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:19,740
Thank you.

1926
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:21,780
Violet, thank you for Twitch Prime.

1927
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:22,720
Thank you.

1928
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:24,120
I appreciate it.

1929
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:24,840
Thank you so much.

1930
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:26,880
Yeah, like...

1931
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:27,660
They're so...

1932
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:28,780
I don't even think...

1933
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:29,890
I don't...

1934
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,380
I don't know what to do.

1935
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:37,400
Okay.

1936
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:38,560
I need to, like...

1937
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:41,060
My keyboard is fucking in a weird area.

1938
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:42,420
Alright.

1939
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:44,680
Okay.

1940
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:47,140
God, I'm, like, so sweaty right now.

1941
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:50,780
So I need to, like...

1942
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:53,440
Because, like, my fucking PC is, like, a goddamn heater.

1943
01:28:54,180 --> 01:28:54,740
That, like...

1944
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:57,640
It's, like, sliding right now.

1945
01:28:57,820 --> 01:28:59,580
I feel, like, a little uncomfortable.

1946
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:02,440
I need to get, like...

1947
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:04,220
I need to get, like, a portable air con.

1948
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:04,740
That's bullshit.

1949
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:08,680
Alright, what's...

1950
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:10,960
Is control on any, like, support found?

1951
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:12,400
I don't remember.

1952
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:14,380
That's the thing.

1953
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:19,840
Like, is...

1954
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:22,680
Is control on anything that's, like, important for support?

1955
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:25,840
Because that's why I can't use, uh...

1956
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:29,780
That's why I can't...

1957
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:30,640
Oh, my God!

1958
01:29:31,420 --> 01:29:32,240
He's okay.

1959
01:29:36,350 --> 01:29:37,210
That's fine.

1960
01:29:41,060 --> 01:29:42,080
Okay, thank God.

1961
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:45,680
No?

1962
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:47,680
Okay, I'll use control for I need healing.

1963
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:51,260
Because this is actually really difficult on, uh...

1964
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:52,580
Is it really difficult on B?

1965
01:29:52,580 --> 01:29:53,780
I'm not used to it.

1966
01:29:53,980 --> 01:29:54,680
It's, like, too...

1967
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:56,060
I have to move too much for that.

1968
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:59,580
While control, I can easily...

1969
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:04,380
Alright.

1970
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:06,340
That's fine.

1971
01:30:09,180 --> 01:30:10,360
They're gonna push up.

1972
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:15,580
That was a Hail Mary pass.

1973
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:19,880
I don't wanna stay too close to my supports.

1974
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:20,680
Other support.

1975
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:23,240
Because of the fact that there's that.

1976
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:23,820
Yeah.

1977
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:28,430
No!

1978
01:30:28,690 --> 01:30:29,610
No, you're out!

1979
01:30:30,030 --> 01:30:30,330
No!

1980
01:30:32,870 --> 01:30:34,670
I'm trying so hard to keep up.

1981
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:36,310
Oh, my God.

1982
01:30:45,650 --> 01:30:47,150
I have to do this.

1983
01:30:49,870 --> 01:30:51,230
Oh, fucking...

1984
01:30:51,230 --> 01:30:51,750
Oh!

1985
01:30:52,830 --> 01:30:53,450
Please!

1986
01:30:54,650 --> 01:30:55,070
No!

1987
01:30:55,730 --> 01:30:56,670
Mac, I...

1988
01:30:56,670 --> 01:30:57,510
Oh, no!

1989
01:30:58,210 --> 01:31:01,230
Oh, no!

1990
01:31:02,370 --> 01:31:04,350
Mac ran off!

1991
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:10,170
I thought our Mantis would get ult first.

1992
01:31:10,410 --> 01:31:11,600
But she didn't.

1993
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:15,890
She didn't get ult first.

1994
01:31:17,820 --> 01:31:19,350
So I had to...

1995
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:20,530
Oh, and our...

1996
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:23,270
And our Mantis couldn't use her ult.

1997
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:24,990
That's very unfortunate.

1998
01:31:26,670 --> 01:31:27,370
That's...

1999
01:31:28,210 --> 01:31:29,510
I think he's dead.

2000
01:31:30,290 --> 01:31:32,670
I think he's dead.

2001
01:31:37,070 --> 01:31:37,590
He...

2002
01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:38,890
He go fought that.

2003
01:31:39,050 --> 01:31:40,870
He was like, I can win this 1v1.

2004
01:31:41,510 --> 01:31:43,390
He didn't win that 1v1.

2005
01:31:43,910 --> 01:31:45,890
I should've yelled at him to get back here.

2006
01:31:46,450 --> 01:31:46,930
I...

2007
01:31:51,770 --> 01:31:54,370
I should've yelled at him to be like, get back here!

2008
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:57,510
That's why I should've used the comm.

2009
01:31:58,510 --> 01:31:59,490
Yeah, everybody literally...

2010
01:31:59,990 --> 01:32:00,630
They have the moon.

2011
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:02,010
So I'm not standing close.

2012
01:32:04,530 --> 01:32:06,670
God, I'm so good at...

2013
01:32:06,670 --> 01:32:07,590
Ult prediction.

2014
01:32:09,610 --> 01:32:10,130
Like...

2015
01:32:10,130 --> 01:32:12,070
It's like I deserve to be in...

2016
01:32:12,070 --> 01:32:12,990
In this elo.

2017
01:32:14,150 --> 01:32:15,610
But like, please give me a high.

2018
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:16,710
Please, I wanna be high.

2019
01:32:17,270 --> 01:32:19,190
Please, shoot the Ankh.

2020
01:32:19,470 --> 01:32:19,910
No!

2021
01:32:23,670 --> 01:32:24,190
No!

2022
01:32:26,670 --> 01:32:28,010
I don't even know.

2023
01:32:28,130 --> 01:32:29,570
They were all bad.

2024
01:32:30,230 --> 01:32:31,610
I'm gonna avoid...

2025
01:32:31,930 --> 01:32:34,570
I'm gonna avoid these games.

2026
01:32:34,810 --> 01:32:35,890
They're not real.

2027
01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:37,570
Alright, guys.

2028
01:32:37,670 --> 01:32:39,410
I guess this solo queue hours.

2029
01:32:44,970 --> 01:32:45,810
Okay.

2030
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:48,270
GG's.

2031
01:32:52,790 --> 01:32:53,630
Alright.

2032
01:32:54,430 --> 01:32:55,790
Mac's a fucking pussy.

2033
01:32:56,250 --> 01:32:57,690
He said...

2034
01:32:59,530 --> 01:33:00,970
He said...

2035
01:33:01,450 --> 01:33:03,090
You're weak, by the way.

2036
01:33:08,370 --> 01:33:09,810
He said...

2037
01:33:09,810 --> 01:33:12,030
He ain't quitting until eternity.

2038
01:33:12,570 --> 01:33:14,050
And he fucking quit.

2039
01:33:14,650 --> 01:33:16,590
Fucking weak as hell.

2040
01:33:24,450 --> 01:33:25,490
Fucking weak.

2041
01:33:25,590 --> 01:33:26,870
Oh wait, I gotta get rid of East Coast.

2042
01:33:26,990 --> 01:33:27,950
All the...

2043
01:33:28,550 --> 01:33:31,550
Eternity players told me to just never play East Coast.

2044
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:33,710
Because...

2045
01:33:34,350 --> 01:33:35,390
All the...

2046
01:33:35,390 --> 01:33:38,250
I'm sorry if you're an East Coast ranked player in Eternity.

2047
01:33:39,010 --> 01:33:41,950
But like, I was literally told by like...

2048
01:33:41,950 --> 01:33:44,870
Everyone I know that's Eternity to never queue East Coast.

2049
01:33:45,050 --> 01:33:46,750
Because that's where all the bad players are.

2050
01:33:49,530 --> 01:33:49,970
Hideous.

2051
01:33:50,190 --> 01:33:50,970
Yup, and Violet.

2052
01:33:51,070 --> 01:33:51,830
Thank you for the Twitch...

2053
01:33:51,830 --> 01:33:52,650
Oh, I already said Violet.

2054
01:33:52,670 --> 01:33:53,650
But thank you for the Twitch friend.

2055
01:33:53,770 --> 01:33:53,950
Thank you.

2056
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:54,510
Thank you.

2057
01:33:55,130 --> 01:33:57,390
So that's why I don't queue East Coast.

2058
01:34:06,490 --> 01:34:06,930
Alright.

2059
01:34:09,550 --> 01:34:12,010
I guess it's solo queue time.

2060
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:21,080
Oh wait.

2061
01:34:21,260 --> 01:34:22,820
I can't even say why.

2062
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:28,480
Like literally everybody's like, don't queue East Coast.

2063
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:29,960
It's not even...

2064
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:31,240
Stop now.

2065
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:32,940
Because...

2066
01:34:32,940 --> 01:34:38,560
Because I promised that I would stream until Eternity.

2067
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:40,900
Oh wait.

2068
01:34:41,420 --> 01:34:41,800
Sorry.

2069
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:43,780
Wrong chat.

2070
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:44,860
La mal.

2071
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:50,500
Yes, I...

2072
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:52,800
I promised that I would stream until Eternity.

2073
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:55,820
I would stream until Eternity.

2074
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:02,470
Well, now they know I'm a streamer.

2075
01:35:02,670 --> 01:35:02,990
Fuck.

2076
01:35:03,150 --> 01:35:03,370
Alright.

2077
01:35:03,790 --> 01:35:04,630
I'll ban Hawkeye.

2078
01:35:06,910 --> 01:35:07,590
Whoops.

2079
01:35:08,370 --> 01:35:09,090
That was awkward.

2080
01:35:09,910 --> 01:35:11,370
That was awkward.

2081
01:35:12,890 --> 01:35:13,770
That's okay.

2082
01:35:15,310 --> 01:35:18,250
Nobody else is banning anything, so...

2083
01:35:18,850 --> 01:35:19,970
I'll ban Bruce Banner.

2084
01:35:20,410 --> 01:35:21,950
I guess I'm the Bruce Banner.

2085
01:35:22,890 --> 01:35:23,750
Oh my...

2086
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:24,930
At least it's not all chat.

2087
01:35:25,230 --> 01:35:25,590
Yeah.

2088
01:35:26,090 --> 01:35:28,150
At least it's not all chat.

2089
01:35:30,070 --> 01:35:32,450
No, I'm banning Bruce Banner because I don't want to play...

2090
01:35:32,450 --> 01:35:33,110
Okay, so somebody...

2091
01:35:33,650 --> 01:35:35,410
Okay, let's hope that we have a hella player.

2092
01:35:36,190 --> 01:35:37,610
Oh my god, we have a Rocket.

2093
01:35:38,270 --> 01:35:41,470
Oh, I like how there are two people that insta-lock Mantis too.

2094
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:43,370
That's looking crazy.

2095
01:35:45,170 --> 01:35:47,050
Maybe I'll meet somebody, guys.

2096
01:35:49,670 --> 01:35:51,370
Maybe I'll meet a player.

2097
01:35:51,370 --> 01:35:53,330
That's gonna be like...

2098
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:55,410
Oh my god, you're pretty good at support.

2099
01:35:56,130 --> 01:35:57,490
You wanna like...

2100
01:35:57,490 --> 01:35:58,430
You wanna duo?

2101
01:35:58,850 --> 01:35:59,450
And then...

2102
01:35:59,450 --> 01:36:01,410
And then we get like a sick-ass win-streak.

2103
01:36:01,510 --> 01:36:02,250
Or we derank.

2104
01:36:02,470 --> 01:36:03,150
I don't know.

2105
01:36:04,330 --> 01:36:05,610
It could be one or the other.

2106
01:36:09,370 --> 01:36:10,770
One or the other.

2107
01:36:11,370 --> 01:36:12,410
Alright, let's see.

2108
01:36:12,490 --> 01:36:13,150
I need healing.

2109
01:36:13,410 --> 01:36:14,290
Where's I need healing?

2110
01:36:16,810 --> 01:36:17,290
Descend.

2111
01:36:17,430 --> 01:36:18,010
Oh, okay.

2112
01:36:18,510 --> 01:36:19,590
We're never gonna have to...

2113
01:36:20,370 --> 01:36:21,670
No hella players.

2114
01:36:22,930 --> 01:36:23,450
Wait.

2115
01:36:25,730 --> 01:36:26,610
Oh, I can...

2116
01:36:26,610 --> 01:36:27,170
Okay.

2117
01:36:37,070 --> 01:36:37,750
Alright.

2118
01:36:39,670 --> 01:36:40,490
Alright, we'll see.

2119
01:36:41,110 --> 01:36:42,450
We don't need to descend anyway.

2120
01:36:42,550 --> 01:36:43,970
My mental is already descended.

2121
01:36:46,610 --> 01:36:47,270
Maybe...

2122
01:36:48,770 --> 01:36:50,190
Maybe it'll be better.

2123
01:36:52,590 --> 01:36:54,610
See, this is so much easier.

2124
01:36:55,730 --> 01:36:56,330
Alright.

2125
01:36:57,230 --> 01:36:59,650
I don't know if I wanna talk to people anymore.

2126
01:37:00,430 --> 01:37:00,910
Like...

2127
01:37:00,910 --> 01:37:03,430
Now I definitely don't know if I wanna talk to people.

2128
01:37:10,030 --> 01:37:11,030
Oh no.

2129
01:37:17,630 --> 01:37:18,770
There's a Venom.

2130
01:37:20,270 --> 01:37:21,830
Oh my god, I reloaded my hands.

2131
01:37:24,790 --> 01:37:25,390
Please!

2132
01:37:26,930 --> 01:37:28,070
Oh my god.

2133
01:37:28,370 --> 01:37:28,930
I knew it.

2134
01:37:29,690 --> 01:37:30,810
Oh my god.

2135
01:37:30,930 --> 01:37:31,370
Please.

2136
01:37:32,550 --> 01:37:33,230
Please.

2137
01:37:34,050 --> 01:37:36,350
You take way too much damage.

2138
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:37,990
For me.

2139
01:37:38,870 --> 01:37:39,550
Please.

2140
01:37:40,430 --> 01:37:41,110
Please!

2141
01:37:41,790 --> 01:37:43,150
Oh my god.

2142
01:37:46,470 --> 01:37:47,710
Oh my god, focus.

2143
01:37:47,890 --> 01:37:48,630
Focus on him.

2144
01:37:48,690 --> 01:37:48,970
Focus.

2145
01:37:51,870 --> 01:37:54,210
Thank god he's kidnapping people.

2146
01:37:54,650 --> 01:37:55,490
I'm so happy.

2147
01:37:55,490 --> 01:37:55,550
I'm so happy.

2148
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:04,470
Oh my god.

2149
01:38:04,650 --> 01:38:06,050
Bro, beat the shit out of him.

2150
01:38:10,390 --> 01:38:11,330
That's fine.

2151
01:38:13,050 --> 01:38:14,010
That's fine.

2152
01:38:14,790 --> 01:38:15,870
I think I'm okay.

2153
01:38:17,550 --> 01:38:18,650
This Wolverine is good.

2154
01:38:19,590 --> 01:38:20,110
Thank god.

2155
01:38:22,910 --> 01:38:23,450
Nevermind.

2156
01:38:25,430 --> 01:38:27,070
I mean, he is good.

2157
01:38:27,210 --> 01:38:28,850
But that's awkward, you know?

2158
01:38:28,850 --> 01:38:28,910
Oh.

2159
01:38:30,870 --> 01:38:32,890
That was very awkward.

2160
01:38:34,030 --> 01:38:34,330
Oh.

2161
01:38:38,750 --> 01:38:39,210
Um.

2162
01:38:41,830 --> 01:38:42,750
Alright.

2163
01:38:43,670 --> 01:38:44,410
Um.

2164
01:38:45,510 --> 01:38:47,390
Okay, don't peek it, guys.

2165
01:38:47,490 --> 01:38:48,510
Don't peek it.

2166
01:38:48,570 --> 01:38:50,350
You can still die.

2167
01:38:51,130 --> 01:38:51,490
Alright.

2168
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:55,930
That's fine.

2169
01:38:59,590 --> 01:39:00,390
That's fine.

2170
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:08,280
Alright, we're okay.

2171
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:11,580
He's gonna go kidnap somebody again.

2172
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:12,380
He's gonna...

2173
01:39:12,380 --> 01:39:13,440
Oh shit!

2174
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:14,100
Okay!

2175
01:39:18,530 --> 01:39:20,590
I don't know who he fucking...

2176
01:39:20,590 --> 01:39:21,330
Okay, hello!

2177
01:39:21,630 --> 01:39:22,630
I'm fucking scared.

2178
01:39:22,770 --> 01:39:23,810
I'm just gonna be here.

2179
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:34,130
I'm just...

2180
01:39:34,130 --> 01:39:35,830
Alright, that's fine.

2181
01:39:36,050 --> 01:39:36,550
I'm...

2182
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:38,490
We're so healthy.

2183
01:39:41,610 --> 01:39:42,430
Alright.

2184
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:43,410
That's okay.

2185
01:39:44,210 --> 01:39:44,870
Helichurl left.

2186
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:50,280
Hela behind us.

2187
01:39:53,260 --> 01:39:53,760
Please!

2188
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:55,460
Hela's behind us!

2189
01:39:55,960 --> 01:39:57,200
Oh my god!

2190
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:58,580
Oh,

2191
01:40:02,610 --> 01:40:03,310
thank god.

2192
01:40:03,850 --> 01:40:05,010
Oh, thank god.

2193
01:40:05,110 --> 01:40:05,430
Okay.

2194
01:40:05,810 --> 01:40:06,830
That's okay.

2195
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:09,570
That's okay.

2196
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:17,380
I'm okay with that.

2197
01:40:17,380 --> 01:40:24,660
Our Wolverine's fucking crazy though.

2198
01:40:24,860 --> 01:40:26,420
He actually is crazy.

2199
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:27,660
Holy shit.

2200
01:40:27,700 --> 01:40:29,060
He's fucking right now.

2201
01:40:33,100 --> 01:40:36,430
He's actually banging right now.

2202
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:39,980
Not our Scarlet though.

2203
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:43,440
Our Scarlet's a little special.

2204
01:40:50,770 --> 01:40:51,890
Jesus Christ.

2205
01:40:55,990 --> 01:40:57,170
Oh, please.

2206
01:40:57,410 --> 01:40:58,430
Oh, I'm here.

2207
01:40:58,870 --> 01:41:00,430
I'm here, everybody.

2208
01:41:00,870 --> 01:41:01,590
I'm gonna...

2209
01:41:01,590 --> 01:41:03,970
Okay, I'm gonna stay on healing now.

2210
01:41:05,010 --> 01:41:05,570
Creepy.

2211
01:41:07,490 --> 01:41:08,670
And then I back up.

2212
01:41:10,790 --> 01:41:11,350
Alright.

2213
01:41:11,710 --> 01:41:12,390
That's fine.

2214
01:41:12,610 --> 01:41:14,130
They don't have any more support ults.

2215
01:41:14,950 --> 01:41:15,690
Oh, there we go.

2216
01:41:15,950 --> 01:41:17,510
There he's going for Zerker right now.

2217
01:41:18,890 --> 01:41:20,050
I don't know...

2218
01:41:20,050 --> 01:41:20,250
Okay.

2219
01:41:20,510 --> 01:41:21,290
I'll be safe here.

2220
01:41:22,110 --> 01:41:23,810
I'll be so safe here.

2221
01:41:24,090 --> 01:41:25,070
I'm not safe.

2222
01:41:25,130 --> 01:41:25,730
I'm not safe.

2223
01:41:27,630 --> 01:41:29,710
Oh my god, thank you.

2224
01:41:30,910 --> 01:41:32,110
Thank you.

2225
01:41:35,030 --> 01:41:36,230
Oh, backing out fully.

2226
01:41:38,030 --> 01:41:39,210
Backing out fully.

2227
01:41:42,210 --> 01:41:43,350
Backing out fully.

2228
01:41:44,010 --> 01:41:45,170
And then I'm still healing.

2229
01:41:46,190 --> 01:41:47,050
I'm clapping.

2230
01:41:48,050 --> 01:41:48,710
I'm...

2231
01:41:50,050 --> 01:41:50,970
What?

2232
01:41:59,010 --> 01:41:59,890
Alright.

2233
01:42:00,370 --> 01:42:00,970
That's fine.

2234
01:42:02,630 --> 01:42:03,950
Please.

2235
01:42:08,910 --> 01:42:12,210
I'm just gonna...

2236
01:42:12,390 --> 01:42:13,150
leave.

2237
01:42:14,370 --> 01:42:16,350
I'm just gonna...

2238
01:42:16,350 --> 01:42:16,710
leave.

2239
01:42:17,730 --> 01:42:19,150
I'm just gonna wait.

2240
01:42:19,430 --> 01:42:20,350
I'm gonna wait here.

2241
01:42:21,130 --> 01:42:22,470
I'm gonna...

2242
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:24,270
I'm gonna wait here.

2243
01:42:25,850 --> 01:42:27,150
Maybe it'll be different.

2244
01:42:33,230 --> 01:42:35,230
Maybe our Wolverine will kidnap somebody.

2245
01:42:36,050 --> 01:42:37,330
Not yet, but like maybe.

2246
01:42:38,250 --> 01:42:38,790
I believe.

2247
01:42:41,370 --> 01:42:42,830
I believe in the...

2248
01:42:43,570 --> 01:42:44,050
Oh...

2249
01:42:44,050 --> 01:42:44,830
That's fine.

2250
01:42:45,210 --> 01:42:46,470
Oh shit, we have Thor!

2251
01:42:47,310 --> 01:42:48,250
Alright, that's fine.

2252
01:42:51,310 --> 01:42:52,570
Alright, we have Thor then.

2253
01:42:52,690 --> 01:42:53,130
He's gonna...

2254
01:42:53,870 --> 01:42:54,530
Am I going with it?

2255
01:42:54,850 --> 01:42:55,470
We just run it down?

2256
01:42:55,950 --> 01:42:57,270
I'm already set up into Duke's team.

2257
01:42:57,270 --> 01:42:57,350
Okay.

2258
01:43:01,890 --> 01:43:03,090
Alright, here we go.

2259
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:04,150
Alright.

2260
01:43:04,670 --> 01:43:06,210
Woah, I'll body block this.

2261
01:43:07,410 --> 01:43:08,050
Yippee!

2262
01:43:11,170 --> 01:43:11,810
Maybe?

2263
01:43:12,470 --> 01:43:13,110
No.

2264
01:43:13,550 --> 01:43:14,390
Oh, maybe?

2265
01:43:15,690 --> 01:43:16,090
Okay.

2266
01:43:25,790 --> 01:43:26,850
Oh my god.

2267
01:43:27,850 --> 01:43:29,430
Oh, and now there's Hela.

2268
01:43:29,830 --> 01:43:30,190
Alright.

2269
01:43:30,470 --> 01:43:31,270
I don't know now.

2270
01:43:33,330 --> 01:43:34,050
So...

2271
01:43:34,050 --> 01:43:35,150
Here you go.

2272
01:43:35,810 --> 01:43:36,870
You go do your thing.

2273
01:43:37,670 --> 01:43:38,310
Because I...

2274
01:43:39,530 --> 01:43:40,250
Yeah...

2275
01:43:45,510 --> 01:43:51,330
I thought like damage boost with the Raccoon will get double the damage.

2276
01:43:53,110 --> 01:43:54,610
Maybe I'll meet like...

2277
01:43:54,610 --> 01:43:56,530
A pro player that's smurfing.

2278
01:43:56,850 --> 01:43:57,510
And then...

2279
01:43:57,510 --> 01:43:59,070
And just be like Shroud.

2280
01:43:59,590 --> 01:44:01,630
Like, I'm a streamer, Mr. Pro Player.

2281
01:44:04,870 --> 01:44:06,010
Right now, it's smurfing.

2282
01:44:06,130 --> 01:44:07,170
You know, you just got the game.

2283
01:44:13,730 --> 01:44:14,350
Oh my god.

2284
01:44:14,510 --> 01:44:15,550
Oh my god, he's so low.

2285
01:44:15,930 --> 01:44:16,250
Nice.

2286
01:44:16,710 --> 01:44:17,130
That's fine.

2287
01:44:17,830 --> 01:44:18,410
You're so healthy.

2288
01:44:18,470 --> 01:44:18,910
You're so healthy.

2289
01:44:18,950 --> 01:44:19,390
You're so healthy.

2290
01:44:19,450 --> 01:44:19,990
You're so healthy.

2291
01:44:20,290 --> 01:44:21,130
You're so healthy.

2292
01:44:21,530 --> 01:44:23,030
You're so fucking healthy.

2293
01:44:27,070 --> 01:44:28,690
Oh my god, where did I go?

2294
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:31,230
Oh shit!

2295
01:44:31,230 --> 01:44:31,430
Oh shit!

2296
01:44:35,430 --> 01:44:37,150
I'm just gonna stand back here.

2297
01:44:37,250 --> 01:44:38,270
You guys go till...

2298
01:44:39,110 --> 01:44:40,270
You guys go do your thing.

2299
01:44:41,310 --> 01:44:43,490
I'm positioning myself so I don't die.

2300
01:44:49,110 --> 01:44:49,630
Alright.

2301
01:44:50,110 --> 01:44:50,810
It'll be fine.

2302
01:44:54,290 --> 01:44:55,590
It'll be fine.

2303
01:44:57,290 --> 01:44:59,810
Not just a pro, but just anybody that's good.

2304
01:44:59,810 --> 01:45:05,810
So I can guarantee that they won't fuck it up.

2305
01:45:06,330 --> 01:45:07,690
That's really it.

2306
01:45:08,190 --> 01:45:12,170
Just to be sure they won't fuck it up for me.

2307
01:45:13,790 --> 01:45:16,530
So everybody else is gonna...

2308
01:45:16,530 --> 01:45:18,950
I'm surprised we're not running Mantis.

2309
01:45:20,490 --> 01:45:21,190
I'm surprised.

2310
01:45:23,430 --> 01:45:25,990
I have 200 ping spiking?

2311
01:45:26,130 --> 01:45:27,230
Who the fuck is it?

2312
01:45:27,890 --> 01:45:29,250
Oh, that's my team.

2313
01:45:29,810 --> 01:45:30,590
Where's he play?

2314
01:45:31,750 --> 01:45:33,130
Oh, he's playing.

2315
01:45:33,650 --> 01:45:34,290
Hello?

2316
01:45:35,970 --> 01:45:37,210
Wait, what was he on before?

2317
01:45:39,550 --> 01:45:41,070
What was he on before?

2318
01:45:47,900 --> 01:45:49,480
Oh, he was on Witch!

2319
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:50,820
Oh!

2320
01:45:52,040 --> 01:45:53,300
How the fuck does he have 20?

2321
01:45:53,580 --> 01:45:54,420
I guess I...

2322
01:45:55,100 --> 01:45:55,740
I...

2323
01:45:55,740 --> 01:45:57,900
I didn't feel like the Witch.

2324
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:00,360
Like...

2325
01:46:01,780 --> 01:46:05,500
It did not feel like the Witch did anything.

2326
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:06,660
How the fuck?

2327
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:08,000
Okay, that's fine.

2328
01:46:09,720 --> 01:46:10,920
That's fine.

2329
01:46:11,860 --> 01:46:12,460
Although...

2330
01:46:12,460 --> 01:46:14,580
I don't think I'm...

2331
01:46:15,180 --> 01:46:16,360
You know, like...

2332
01:46:16,360 --> 01:46:18,820
Having a duo made me think that it was possible.

2333
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:20,720
But now I don't...

2334
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:21,860
I don't know anymore.

2335
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:29,540
Now that I don't have a duo, I'm like...

2336
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:30,880
Becoming...

2337
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:32,040
Less...

2338
01:46:32,660 --> 01:46:34,340
I'm being less confident.

2339
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:36,500
That's why I was so confident in my stream title.

2340
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:37,800
And I thought...

2341
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:40,320
I thought he was in it for the long haul, you know?

2342
01:46:41,060 --> 01:46:43,740
I thought Mack was in it for the long haul.

2343
01:46:49,030 --> 01:46:50,890
Now I'm a little less confident.

2344
01:46:51,670 --> 01:46:52,690
I mean, it's still possible.

2345
01:46:53,030 --> 01:46:55,810
I might get like the best RNG of teammates...

2346
01:46:55,810 --> 01:46:57,190
I could ever ask for.

2347
01:46:57,450 --> 01:46:59,350
But there's a reason why...

2348
01:46:59,350 --> 01:47:01,290
Everybody stacks now.

2349
01:47:04,110 --> 01:47:07,150
You know, just to lessen the RNG.

2350
01:47:11,430 --> 01:47:12,130
Where is he?

2351
01:47:13,310 --> 01:47:14,370
Oh, wait.

2352
01:47:14,670 --> 01:47:15,410
A hell of high ground?

2353
01:47:16,350 --> 01:47:17,890
Oh my god, no!

2354
01:47:18,030 --> 01:47:18,730
Oh wait, nice.

2355
01:47:19,410 --> 01:47:19,910
I'm back.

2356
01:47:29,150 --> 01:47:30,270
Jesus Christ.

2357
01:47:30,930 --> 01:47:33,730
I don't even know if my mic actually works, to be fair.

2358
01:47:34,190 --> 01:47:35,770
Nobody fucking talks here anyway.

2359
01:47:35,770 --> 01:47:39,230
I just assumed he looked back.

2360
01:47:39,330 --> 01:47:40,970
They looked back just because I died.

2361
01:47:45,110 --> 01:47:46,110
I'm back.

2362
01:47:50,410 --> 01:47:52,090
I'm almost close to up.

2363
01:47:57,880 --> 01:47:58,220
Hello.

2364
01:48:03,570 --> 01:48:04,250
Okay!

2365
01:48:06,230 --> 01:48:10,100
Oh, hey Penny!

2366
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:11,300
Woah!

2367
01:48:13,740 --> 01:48:15,100
Alright, this...

2368
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:15,820
Can we burn Hela?

2369
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:19,860
Goodbye, Rocket.

2370
01:48:20,180 --> 01:48:20,860
Hela on cart!

2371
01:48:24,700 --> 01:48:25,700
Please, Hela's low!

2372
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:30,420
Oh my god.

2373
01:48:31,640 --> 01:48:33,020
Everything is fine.

2374
01:48:33,320 --> 01:48:34,120
I need a health pack.

2375
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:37,440
Guys, I'm scared of playing...

2376
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:38,800
Where's the health pack on this side?

2377
01:48:38,840 --> 01:48:40,040
I thought there was a health pack on this side.

2378
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:44,540
I'm scared of like playing against this Wolverine.

2379
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:50,100
I'm really scared.

2380
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:51,600
She seems...

2381
01:48:52,360 --> 01:48:54,200
He seems really, really good.

2382
01:48:54,940 --> 01:48:59,500
And knowing my luck, he's gonna take back the rank points that he gave me.

2383
01:49:08,930 --> 01:49:11,970
Knowing my luck, I can feel it.

2384
01:49:13,150 --> 01:49:16,590
I can feel he will... he take back what he gave it to me.

2385
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:27,560
Oh my god.

2386
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:30,620
Don't worry, Wolverine!

2387
01:49:31,340 --> 01:49:32,380
Don't worry!

2388
01:49:32,820 --> 01:49:34,220
You're so healthy!

2389
01:49:37,900 --> 01:49:39,760
You're so healthy!

2390
01:49:41,140 --> 01:49:42,660
Oh my god!

2391
01:49:43,860 --> 01:49:45,540
You're so healthy!

2392
01:49:49,350 --> 01:49:50,590
Oh, he's dead.

2393
01:49:54,330 --> 01:49:55,190
Yippee!

2394
01:49:57,190 --> 01:49:58,770
Oh my god.

2395
01:49:59,270 --> 01:50:00,870
Am I gonna play against this Wolverine?

2396
01:50:01,690 --> 01:50:03,670
I think I'm gonna play against this Wolverine, guys.

2397
01:50:03,930 --> 01:50:04,930
I think...

2398
01:50:06,590 --> 01:50:08,030
I think...

2399
01:50:08,030 --> 01:50:11,410
I feel like I'm gonna play against this Wolverine.

2400
01:50:12,670 --> 01:50:14,570
I feel like it.

2401
01:50:15,970 --> 01:50:16,830
Where is he?

2402
01:50:18,750 --> 01:50:19,470
Alright.

2403
01:50:24,910 --> 01:50:26,150
Alright, he's just gonna C9.

2404
01:50:31,010 --> 01:50:32,730
Oh my god, not again!

2405
01:50:36,490 --> 01:50:37,390
Who's on cart?

2406
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:41,980
Alright.

2407
01:50:42,620 --> 01:50:43,700
Okay, here we go.

2408
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:47,760
I'm ready to like...

2409
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:50,080
I don't even know if my mic worked.

2410
01:50:51,180 --> 01:50:52,820
I don't even know.

2411
01:50:54,620 --> 01:50:55,480
That's the moon.

2412
01:50:56,700 --> 01:50:57,460
Oh my god, that's a lot.

2413
01:50:57,540 --> 01:50:59,340
Yeah, but my... we both had a lot of healers.

2414
01:51:00,060 --> 01:51:02,260
Both of us had like a ton of healers.

2415
01:51:02,360 --> 01:51:03,420
Yeah, our healer was insane.

2416
01:51:07,590 --> 01:51:08,490
Oh my god.

2417
01:51:09,670 --> 01:51:10,330
I'm scared.

2418
01:51:10,330 --> 01:51:13,470
I'm scared he's gonna take away the points he gave me.

2419
01:51:14,970 --> 01:51:16,410
I'm so scared.

2420
01:51:20,470 --> 01:51:21,670
I make a check.

2421
01:51:23,170 --> 01:51:25,110
Yeah, all of them did really well.

2422
01:51:26,430 --> 01:51:27,830
Oh shit, wait, why did Mendo...

2423
01:51:27,830 --> 01:51:30,330
Why is Mendo Diamond 1?!

2424
01:51:31,090 --> 01:51:32,310
Oh, and he...

2425
01:51:37,570 --> 01:51:38,130
Okay.

2426
01:51:38,130 --> 01:51:38,150
Okay.

2427
01:51:39,270 --> 01:51:40,670
Let me check.

2428
01:51:41,070 --> 01:51:41,970
I'm sorry Mendo.

2429
01:51:42,830 --> 01:51:44,350
I just... I didn't know.

2430
01:51:44,730 --> 01:51:46,370
Why is he Diamond 1?!

2431
01:51:47,250 --> 01:51:48,050
Okay.

2432
01:51:49,970 --> 01:51:53,130
He D-ranked playing with Xkitsie.

2433
01:51:54,570 --> 01:51:55,370
Wow.

2434
01:51:59,650 --> 01:52:02,190
I was like, weren't you in GM?

2435
01:52:02,630 --> 01:52:03,270
I was like...

2436
01:52:03,270 --> 01:52:03,670
Ryan!

2437
01:52:07,370 --> 01:52:09,430
Alright, let me check if my mic is on.

2438
01:52:09,470 --> 01:52:09,930
It is!

2439
01:52:09,990 --> 01:52:10,630
It is on.

2440
01:52:10,750 --> 01:52:11,050
Okay.

2441
01:52:12,110 --> 01:52:13,270
I can check like...

2442
01:52:13,870 --> 01:52:15,350
I was like, why do I...

2443
01:52:15,350 --> 01:52:18,170
I was just like, wait, I have more people on here than usual.

2444
01:52:18,950 --> 01:52:19,990
No, it is on.

2445
01:52:20,090 --> 01:52:21,270
They just no put the...

2446
01:52:23,850 --> 01:52:24,650
Thank god.

2447
01:52:26,230 --> 01:52:26,910
Who's... okay.

2448
01:52:27,190 --> 01:52:28,430
Sorry, I don't know who you are.

2449
01:52:30,690 --> 01:52:31,990
I swear to god.

2450
01:52:31,990 --> 01:52:32,970
We're on...

2451
01:52:35,870 --> 01:52:37,930
I swear to god.

2452
01:52:41,090 --> 01:52:42,990
D-ranked for the Cloud.

2453
01:52:43,550 --> 01:52:44,990
Okay, I need him...

2454
01:52:44,990 --> 01:52:46,050
I need him un-private.

2455
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:46,990
I need to see this.

2456
01:52:47,230 --> 01:52:50,170
I need him to un-private so I can see it.

2457
01:52:51,790 --> 01:52:54,170
To see what the fuck happened.

2458
01:52:56,430 --> 01:52:59,570
When I wake up, I see Doki playing Viral Rivals.

2459
01:53:00,170 --> 01:53:00,810
Yeah.

2460
01:53:01,230 --> 01:53:02,230
It's a problem.

2461
01:53:03,550 --> 01:53:04,350
It's actually...

2462
01:53:04,350 --> 01:53:05,250
No, I'm not...

2463
01:53:05,250 --> 01:53:07,290
If you see me still streaming...

2464
01:53:07,290 --> 01:53:08,270
I am not...

2465
01:53:08,270 --> 01:53:08,830
I am...

2466
01:53:08,830 --> 01:53:09,810
I am not...

2467
01:53:10,390 --> 01:53:11,290
Did he un-private it?

2468
01:53:11,930 --> 01:53:13,050
No, he still has it private.

2469
01:53:13,150 --> 01:53:14,070
I don't know if I should queue up.

2470
01:53:14,570 --> 01:53:15,450
You could be muted.

2471
01:53:15,570 --> 01:53:16,230
Just check it.

2472
01:53:16,310 --> 01:53:17,090
How do I check if I'm muted?

2473
01:53:17,130 --> 01:53:17,830
No, it works.

2474
01:53:17,930 --> 01:53:19,310
Cause like...

2475
01:53:19,310 --> 01:53:20,030
How do I check?

2476
01:53:20,330 --> 01:53:21,750
I mean, that's mic volume.

2477
01:53:22,370 --> 01:53:23,490
Yeah, voice chat's on.

2478
01:53:23,570 --> 01:53:24,150
Right here.

2479
01:53:25,410 --> 01:53:26,610
It should be fine.

2480
01:53:30,850 --> 01:53:31,850
It should be it.

2481
01:53:31,850 --> 01:53:34,250
They just don't acknowledge me as a person.

2482
01:53:34,490 --> 01:53:35,170
Which is fine.

2483
01:53:37,310 --> 01:53:37,950
Which...

2484
01:53:37,950 --> 01:53:39,550
I'm okay with that.

2485
01:53:39,830 --> 01:53:40,150
You know?

2486
01:53:40,750 --> 01:53:42,350
As long as they know...

2487
01:53:42,350 --> 01:53:45,390
As long as they know like...

2488
01:53:45,390 --> 01:53:46,010
I'm...

2489
01:53:46,010 --> 01:53:47,310
I'm trying.

2490
01:53:49,850 --> 01:53:50,490
I'm...

2491
01:53:50,490 --> 01:53:51,590
I'm trying.

2492
01:53:51,930 --> 01:53:53,330
That's all that matters to me.

2493
01:53:53,470 --> 01:53:53,610
You know?

2494
01:53:54,770 --> 01:53:58,650
As long as they know that I'm trying my best.

2495
01:53:59,550 --> 01:54:01,090
In this world.

2496
01:54:01,090 --> 01:54:03,310
That's all that matters.

2497
01:54:05,630 --> 01:54:06,210
Okay.

2498
01:54:07,750 --> 01:54:09,410
Well, I didn't talk in...

2499
01:54:09,410 --> 01:54:10,490
I didn't...

2500
01:54:11,090 --> 01:54:12,280
I didn't talk in...

2501
01:54:12,950 --> 01:54:13,530
On...

2502
01:54:13,530 --> 01:54:14,010
In the games.

2503
01:54:14,170 --> 01:54:15,830
Because I never feel like I had to.

2504
01:54:16,350 --> 01:54:17,090
So like...

2505
01:54:17,770 --> 01:54:18,970
It should be fine.

2506
01:54:19,110 --> 01:54:19,650
Alright, Ruben.

2507
01:54:19,670 --> 01:54:21,290
Let me see your history.

2508
01:54:21,910 --> 01:54:24,150
How do you rank from GM1 to Diamond?

2509
01:54:24,570 --> 01:54:25,910
Do I uninstall?

2510
01:54:27,570 --> 01:54:28,510
Le mal.

2511
01:54:30,070 --> 01:54:30,870
Unprivate.

2512
01:54:31,190 --> 01:54:31,970
So I can see.

2513
01:54:37,690 --> 01:54:39,470
No, I can't.

2514
01:54:39,470 --> 01:54:40,150
Show me.

2515
01:54:41,630 --> 01:54:43,310
You could be lying.

2516
01:54:44,330 --> 01:54:46,370
It could be just...

2517
01:54:46,370 --> 01:54:47,930
Just...

2518
01:54:47,930 --> 01:54:48,890
You getting diffed.

2519
01:54:54,130 --> 01:54:55,930
I need proof.

2520
01:54:58,850 --> 01:54:59,770
Then unprivate.

2521
01:55:02,950 --> 01:55:04,730
Why are you scared?

2522
01:55:09,410 --> 01:55:10,870
Why is he scared?

2523
01:55:11,230 --> 01:55:12,830
If it's true...

2524
01:55:12,830 --> 01:55:13,830
Then unprivate.

2525
01:55:14,030 --> 01:55:15,170
Unprivate it.

2526
01:55:15,570 --> 01:55:16,950
If it's true.

2527
01:55:17,310 --> 01:55:18,610
If it's true.

2528
01:55:19,210 --> 01:55:20,030
Then...

2529
01:55:20,030 --> 01:55:20,670
Unprivate.

2530
01:55:22,370 --> 01:55:27,930
He said it was because of XQC, right?

2531
01:55:29,150 --> 01:55:30,030
Then prove it.

2532
01:55:30,650 --> 01:55:32,170
I wanna see the last streak.

2533
01:55:32,370 --> 01:55:33,550
I just...

2534
01:55:33,550 --> 01:55:35,730
I wanna see the last streak with XQC.

2535
01:55:38,690 --> 01:55:39,710
Okay, no.

2536
01:55:39,890 --> 01:55:42,700
It's not because of XQC.

2537
01:55:47,570 --> 01:55:49,170
So it is...

2538
01:55:49,170 --> 01:55:50,970
So it is...

2539
01:55:50,970 --> 01:55:52,230
Because of...

2540
01:55:52,230 --> 01:55:56,430
People add our teammates and offer them money to throw?

2541
01:55:57,150 --> 01:55:58,710
Why was I not...

2542
01:56:00,650 --> 01:56:04,090
He was on my team one time.

2543
01:56:07,650 --> 01:56:09,430
Shaked my head.

2544
01:56:10,390 --> 01:56:13,110
What the fuck?

2545
01:56:13,650 --> 01:56:14,350
Bro.

2546
01:56:14,810 --> 01:56:17,350
That cannot be real.

2547
01:56:17,710 --> 01:56:19,290
Holy fuck.

2548
01:56:20,170 --> 01:56:22,070
There's no way.

2549
01:56:22,430 --> 01:56:24,010
Bro, that's like insane.

2550
01:56:24,390 --> 01:56:26,090
That's just win trading.

2551
01:56:26,710 --> 01:56:28,290
Holy shit.

2552
01:56:29,630 --> 01:56:30,810
Alright, I take it.

2553
01:56:32,150 --> 01:56:36,110
I mean, it depends on how much money they offer, to be fair.

2554
01:56:36,290 --> 01:56:36,890
Depends on...

2555
01:56:36,890 --> 01:56:37,810
That's actually...

2556
01:56:37,810 --> 01:56:39,230
I take it once.

2557
01:56:39,410 --> 01:56:40,070
Just because I...

2558
01:56:40,070 --> 01:56:41,670
Just because I'm like...

2559
01:56:41,670 --> 01:56:42,430
But I take it.

2560
01:56:42,490 --> 01:56:43,350
But then like...

2561
01:56:43,350 --> 01:56:44,330
I wouldn't throw.

2562
01:56:44,750 --> 01:56:45,870
I just do it once.

2563
01:56:45,970 --> 01:56:47,290
Because I know that...

2564
01:56:48,150 --> 01:56:49,190
I know like...

2565
01:56:49,190 --> 01:56:50,230
They're so desperate.

2566
01:56:50,750 --> 01:56:51,710
So I take the money.

2567
01:56:51,910 --> 01:56:52,710
But I wouldn't throw.

2568
01:56:52,790 --> 01:56:54,310
Because there won't be a second time.

2569
01:56:54,650 --> 01:56:56,610
Because it would be weird.

2570
01:56:56,710 --> 01:56:56,970
They're like...

2571
01:56:56,970 --> 01:56:58,770
Wow, every time Dirt Keeper gets in the lobby...

2572
01:56:58,770 --> 01:56:59,710
You can see they lose.

2573
01:57:00,590 --> 01:57:01,150
Like...

2574
01:57:02,710 --> 01:57:04,090
I wouldn't do it.

2575
01:57:04,250 --> 01:57:05,370
I just take the money.

2576
01:57:05,630 --> 01:57:06,230
And then like...

2577
01:57:06,530 --> 01:57:07,330
Just take it.

2578
01:57:07,410 --> 01:57:08,170
And not throw.

2579
01:57:09,650 --> 01:57:11,770
Wait, he's also a group one trick?

2580
01:57:12,790 --> 01:57:13,770
Wait, is he actually?

2581
01:57:14,150 --> 01:57:16,290
I'm surprised he's not...

2582
01:57:16,290 --> 01:57:17,350
A Hulk main.

2583
01:57:17,550 --> 01:57:19,090
Because he's basically like Winston.

2584
01:57:21,030 --> 01:57:22,890
He's basically like Winston.

2585
01:57:23,050 --> 01:57:23,210
Alright.

2586
01:57:24,450 --> 01:57:25,270
I'm private.

2587
01:57:25,890 --> 01:57:26,530
I'm private.

2588
01:57:26,970 --> 01:57:28,020
I want to see...

2589
01:57:34,210 --> 01:57:35,470
Oh my god.

2590
01:57:35,710 --> 01:57:38,970
Why can't I see your profile?

2591
01:57:39,750 --> 01:57:40,970
Oh my god.

2592
01:57:41,010 --> 01:57:42,850
Okay, let's see XQC's profile.

2593
01:57:43,510 --> 01:57:45,910
I don't understand why he wouldn't let me see his profile.

2594
01:57:46,130 --> 01:57:46,590
Let's see.

2595
01:57:47,070 --> 01:57:47,970
It's not even...

2596
01:57:48,910 --> 01:57:52,010
It's not even that bad.

2597
01:57:52,390 --> 01:57:54,070
It's not even...

2598
01:57:54,070 --> 01:57:55,170
I'm not gonna lie.

2599
01:57:55,170 --> 01:57:57,490
This is not even that bad.

2600
01:57:57,810 --> 01:57:59,570
Like, you're still...

2601
01:57:59,570 --> 01:58:01,390
Like, there's some wins in there.

2602
01:58:01,430 --> 01:58:03,170
How the fuck did you get from GM1...

2603
01:58:04,410 --> 01:58:05,390
To Diamond?

2604
01:58:07,690 --> 01:58:09,910
He only dropped one tier.

2605
01:58:12,910 --> 01:58:16,010
XQC only dropped one tier.

2606
01:58:16,210 --> 01:58:18,230
What the fuck happened in between?

2607
01:58:24,300 --> 01:58:24,740
Oh!

2608
01:58:26,020 --> 01:58:29,000
He was in Diamond lobbies.

2609
01:58:33,180 --> 01:58:35,720
Okay, that makes sense.

2610
01:58:36,820 --> 01:58:40,160
Okay, not really, but like...

2611
01:58:40,160 --> 01:58:42,420
Because you only lose four points more.

2612
01:58:44,240 --> 01:58:46,720
And now I am too.

2613
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:48,880
Rest in peace.

2614
01:58:50,780 --> 01:58:52,160
I won't say it.

2615
01:58:55,580 --> 01:58:57,860
I'm gonna Q dodge you.

2616
01:59:04,140 --> 01:59:07,160
I don't know if it's still...

2617
01:59:07,160 --> 01:59:10,820
I don't know if the luck is still following you.

2618
01:59:15,380 --> 01:59:16,980
Alright, we got Q'd.

2619
01:59:17,020 --> 01:59:17,820
We can't.

2620
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:18,860
We got Q dodged.

2621
01:59:19,820 --> 01:59:20,300
Mendo.

2622
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:22,760
We gotta Q dodge him.

2623
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:24,620
Tell him he's on the avoid list.

2624
01:59:24,720 --> 01:59:25,600
Yeah, but like...

2625
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:27,000
I don't know who he's dueling with.

2626
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:29,980
Whoever he's dueling with must be...

2627
01:59:29,980 --> 01:59:31,000
I don't know.

2628
01:59:31,300 --> 01:59:32,200
Could be good.

2629
01:59:32,820 --> 01:59:34,380
I mean, Mendo's good too.

2630
01:59:34,580 --> 01:59:36,340
But like, then it'll be two good players.

2631
01:59:36,380 --> 01:59:37,000
Because they're both...

2632
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:38,060
Because he's an Overwatch player.

2633
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:39,540
So like, he knows what he's doing.

2634
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:43,620
He knows what he's doing.

2635
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:44,280
So like...

2636
01:59:44,280 --> 01:59:45,740
Don't say I'll be dropping a...

2637
01:59:45,740 --> 01:59:46,340
Don't!

2638
01:59:46,360 --> 01:59:46,740
Stop!

2639
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:47,640
Stop!

2640
01:59:48,220 --> 01:59:49,760
Guys, stop.

2641
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:50,980
I'll be...

2642
01:59:52,380 --> 01:59:53,020
Oh, true.

2643
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:54,080
I won't get him anyway.

2644
01:59:54,260 --> 01:59:54,700
That's true.

2645
01:59:54,840 --> 01:59:55,620
I can just Q up.

2646
01:59:56,120 --> 01:59:56,720
Alright, Ruben.

2647
01:59:56,940 --> 01:59:58,060
Q a solo game.

2648
01:59:58,180 --> 01:59:58,940
And then win it.

2649
01:59:59,020 --> 01:59:59,680
And then we'll duo.

2650
02:00:00,740 --> 02:00:01,680
I believe in you.

2651
02:00:03,500 --> 02:00:04,680
I believe in you.

2652
02:00:04,980 --> 02:00:05,440
Don't worry.

2653
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:06,900
I might lose my solo game.

2654
02:00:07,040 --> 02:00:08,180
Because I'm a support player.

2655
02:00:16,990 --> 02:00:17,750
Don't worry.

2656
02:00:18,270 --> 02:00:19,890
You might be in my lobby, Ruben.

2657
02:00:20,850 --> 02:00:22,970
Ruben, we might be on the same team anyway.

2658
02:00:24,050 --> 02:00:24,590
JK.

2659
02:00:24,890 --> 02:00:25,690
We might be...

2660
02:00:25,690 --> 02:00:27,040
We might be on the same team.

2661
02:00:29,890 --> 02:00:30,730
No, Ra?

2662
02:00:31,270 --> 02:00:35,210
You guys know why cursor Ra isn't even in my chat right now?

2663
02:00:35,290 --> 02:00:37,930
Because I fucking blacklisted that word.

2664
02:00:38,330 --> 02:00:40,910
I blacklisted that phrase.

2665
02:00:44,570 --> 02:00:47,050
I'm fucking tired of your curses.

2666
02:00:47,410 --> 02:00:49,590
I literally did it in the middle of my stream.

2667
02:00:49,890 --> 02:00:53,150
When I de-ranked, I literally blacklisted cursor Ra.

2668
02:00:57,830 --> 02:01:00,270
I was like, no, I can't.

2669
02:01:00,270 --> 02:01:01,850
I can't deal with this anymore.

2670
02:01:02,070 --> 02:01:04,510
I don't fucking trust any of you guys.

2671
02:01:04,710 --> 02:01:06,710
I don't trust you guys anymore.

2672
02:01:06,930 --> 02:01:10,550
I'm fucking taking that out of your dictionary.

2673
02:01:10,830 --> 02:01:11,950
Of your fucking vocabulary.

2674
02:01:14,150 --> 02:01:15,430
Alright, guys.

2675
02:01:15,870 --> 02:01:17,990
Surely, things will be okay.

2676
02:01:17,990 --> 02:01:19,070
Right?

2677
02:01:20,670 --> 02:01:25,410
Maybe we'll bump into some stack or solo player that'll adopt me in.

2678
02:01:25,610 --> 02:01:27,550
And be like, pocket me.

2679
02:01:27,790 --> 02:01:29,390
And I'll be like, okay.

2680
02:01:29,990 --> 02:01:31,490
As long as I get eternity.

2681
02:01:35,050 --> 02:01:36,970
Keep the orb on me.

2682
02:01:37,110 --> 02:01:39,710
And I'll be like, as long as I get eternity.

2683
02:01:41,290 --> 02:01:42,250
The dream.

2684
02:01:43,270 --> 02:01:44,270
The dream.

2685
02:01:44,570 --> 02:01:46,070
The pocket dream.

2686
02:01:46,930 --> 02:01:47,650
Surely.

2687
02:01:48,830 --> 02:01:51,190
Surely I can adopt somebody in.

2688
02:01:52,170 --> 02:01:53,950
It could be that easy, right?

2689
02:01:55,910 --> 02:01:57,830
Everything will be okay, guys.

2690
02:01:59,670 --> 02:02:02,490
Did you ban the hieroglyphics?

2691
02:02:05,330 --> 02:02:06,050
Alright.

2692
02:02:06,530 --> 02:02:07,250
We're just waiting.

2693
02:02:07,730 --> 02:02:09,230
Oh my god, this queue is so long.

2694
02:02:10,030 --> 02:02:11,030
I'm surprised.

2695
02:02:12,810 --> 02:02:13,570
I'm surprised.

2696
02:02:13,570 --> 02:02:17,370
Oh yeah, like the stream sniper shit reminds me of like, what was it?

2697
02:02:18,450 --> 02:02:23,570
The Kai and Speed's Fortnite marathon thing.

2698
02:02:24,350 --> 02:02:26,950
Where they're just getting stream sniped every single day.

2699
02:02:27,350 --> 02:02:28,210
And it was so funny.

2700
02:02:28,310 --> 02:02:31,030
The one game they actually won, a stream sniper helped them.

2701
02:02:31,310 --> 02:02:35,530
But their contract is like, they have to play Fortnite for three days.

2702
02:02:35,770 --> 02:02:37,090
So they just made up an excuse.

2703
02:02:37,270 --> 02:02:40,330
And being like, no, a stream sniper helped us win.

2704
02:02:40,410 --> 02:02:41,610
So we gotta keep going.

2705
02:02:43,110 --> 02:02:47,570
But they're like, they literally are getting paid to play for three days, apparently.

2706
02:02:47,950 --> 02:02:49,050
I could be lying.

2707
02:02:49,170 --> 02:02:49,410
I don't know.

2708
02:02:49,470 --> 02:02:50,190
I read that on Twitter.

2709
02:02:51,130 --> 02:02:51,930
I read that on Twitter.

2710
02:02:52,150 --> 02:02:59,290
But it was really funny seeing the amount of stream snipers that do fight them in Fortnite.

2711
02:02:59,570 --> 02:03:01,370
Because it's so easy to snipe.

2712
02:03:02,690 --> 02:03:06,050
It's so easy to queue snipe somebody in Fortnite.

2713
02:03:06,890 --> 02:03:07,830
Wait, Ruben got...

2714
02:03:07,830 --> 02:03:08,490
I dodged...

2715
02:03:08,490 --> 02:03:09,750
Oh, that must be an East Coast game.

2716
02:03:09,750 --> 02:03:12,610
Ruben must have got an East Coast game or some shit.

2717
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,540
So like, he might be fucked.

2718
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:20,420
Honestly.

2719
02:03:21,680 --> 02:03:23,100
East Coast servers just ain't it.

2720
02:03:23,940 --> 02:03:25,160
Why is Mendo not queuing up?

2721
02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:27,760
What is he waiting for?

2722
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:32,480
Alright.

2723
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:34,360
What...

2724
02:03:35,940 --> 02:03:37,800
What game did I get myself into?

2725
02:03:39,100 --> 02:03:39,400
What?

2726
02:03:45,180 --> 02:03:46,000
Excuse me?

2727
02:03:46,180 --> 02:03:47,280
What game is this?

2728
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:49,400
What the fuck?

2729
02:03:57,080 --> 02:03:57,420
Okay.

2730
02:03:57,860 --> 02:03:59,920
No, it's 3-1 above all else on my team.

2731
02:04:02,900 --> 02:04:04,280
Oh my god.

2732
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:06,740
Hawk then Scythe.

2733
02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:07,280
Sure.

2734
02:04:10,060 --> 02:04:10,720
Oh, okay.

2735
02:04:10,860 --> 02:04:11,140
Strange.

2736
02:04:11,500 --> 02:04:11,760
Okay.

2737
02:04:12,100 --> 02:04:12,720
I don't...

2738
02:04:12,720 --> 02:04:13,220
Fucking...

2739
02:04:13,220 --> 02:04:13,720
I don't know.

2740
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:15,540
I'm a...

2741
02:04:15,540 --> 02:04:16,220
I'm a sheep.

2742
02:04:17,920 --> 02:04:18,840
I got a lock in.

2743
02:04:18,920 --> 02:04:20,580
I'm like slouched right now on my chair.

2744
02:04:20,700 --> 02:04:21,220
Like I'm lean...

2745
02:04:21,220 --> 02:04:21,600
Not slouched.

2746
02:04:21,680 --> 02:04:23,240
I'm lean back on my chair right now.

2747
02:04:23,260 --> 02:04:24,200
Because we had like a...

2748
02:04:24,740 --> 02:04:25,100
30...

2749
02:04:25,100 --> 02:04:25,700
Like a...

2750
02:04:25,700 --> 02:04:26,720
20 minute...

2751
02:04:27,800 --> 02:04:28,160
Intermission.

2752
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:32,280
Alright.

2753
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:32,800
Sure.

2754
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:33,280
We don't...

2755
02:04:33,280 --> 02:04:35,100
We don't fuck with Dr. Strange.

2756
02:04:35,260 --> 02:04:36,120
Oh, but what if they go...

2757
02:04:36,120 --> 02:04:36,280
Oh, wait.

2758
02:04:36,300 --> 02:04:37,160
They banned Bruce Banner.

2759
02:04:38,200 --> 02:04:40,420
I get a lot of points if I do win this.

2760
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:41,840
Because I'm just a little...

2761
02:04:42,640 --> 02:04:44,000
I'm just a little...

2762
02:04:44,920 --> 02:04:46,040
A little...

2763
02:04:46,040 --> 02:04:47,080
GM too.

2764
02:04:47,740 --> 02:04:48,020
Alright.

2765
02:04:50,240 --> 02:04:50,800
Alright.

2766
02:04:54,280 --> 02:04:55,160
Here we go.

2767
02:04:57,020 --> 02:04:57,220
Oh!

2768
02:04:58,020 --> 02:05:00,240
Allen and Wright, thank you for the...

2769
02:05:00,240 --> 02:05:00,960
Thank you.

2770
02:05:01,080 --> 02:05:01,600
Thank you.

2771
02:05:01,700 --> 02:05:03,020
Blessing of Khonshu.

2772
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:04,140
Oh my god.

2773
02:05:04,220 --> 02:05:04,980
I hope so.

2774
02:05:05,240 --> 02:05:06,080
I mean, we have a...

2775
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:08,180
That was a one above all, right?

2776
02:05:08,240 --> 02:05:08,640
Widow?

2777
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:09,280
Claire?

2778
02:05:10,980 --> 02:05:12,380
We get these Pearl.

2779
02:05:12,700 --> 02:05:13,240
Oh my gosh.

2780
02:05:13,260 --> 02:05:13,960
I hope so.

2781
02:05:14,360 --> 02:05:15,940
I don't lose a lot, right?

2782
02:05:16,360 --> 02:05:18,280
Yeah, I don't lose a lot because I'm the lowest.

2783
02:05:22,510 --> 02:05:23,470
At least...

2784
02:05:23,470 --> 02:05:24,910
At least we have that going for me.

2785
02:05:25,590 --> 02:05:26,450
Okay, it's Ka.

2786
02:05:27,310 --> 02:05:28,990
He don't know you little bro.

2787
02:05:32,590 --> 02:05:33,070
Damn.

2788
02:05:34,830 --> 02:05:35,310
Alright.

2789
02:05:38,390 --> 02:05:39,190
Let's go.

2790
02:05:43,360 --> 02:05:44,260
I'm not a damn lobby.

2791
02:05:44,360 --> 02:05:45,020
I'm a GM.

2792
02:05:45,320 --> 02:05:46,320
Oh, Eternity.

2793
02:05:46,500 --> 02:05:47,660
One above all lobby.

2794
02:05:49,420 --> 02:05:49,860
Damn.

2795
02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:51,440
Oh, I should grab this.

2796
02:05:52,080 --> 02:05:53,500
Do we have Mantle?

2797
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:55,020
Oh, we're running triple support.

2798
02:05:55,140 --> 02:05:55,820
Alright, let's go.

2799
02:05:56,880 --> 02:05:57,640
Let's fucking go.

2800
02:05:57,740 --> 02:05:59,200
Our only DPS is Widow.

2801
02:05:59,300 --> 02:06:01,540
I fucking believe in this team so hard.

2802
02:06:03,200 --> 02:06:04,160
I'm so...

2803
02:06:04,160 --> 02:06:05,500
I believe in this team.

2804
02:06:06,220 --> 02:06:08,040
I don't know if I wanna talk in this team.

2805
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:09,460
Like, then I'm scared.

2806
02:06:09,560 --> 02:06:10,480
It'll be like...

2807
02:06:10,480 --> 02:06:12,300
Oh, she's fucking dog shit.

2808
02:06:12,300 --> 02:06:13,340
Three healers.

2809
02:06:13,420 --> 02:06:13,760
Let's go.

2810
02:06:15,120 --> 02:06:16,040
Triple support.

2811
02:06:24,490 --> 02:06:26,030
Alright, I'm Groot.

2812
02:06:28,470 --> 02:06:29,890
Oh, Sylak behind us?

2813
02:06:32,510 --> 02:06:33,710
Sylak still behind.

2814
02:06:38,380 --> 02:06:39,020
Hey, tanks.

2815
02:06:39,780 --> 02:06:41,540
I'm just gonna play with my tanks.

2816
02:06:49,150 --> 02:06:51,050
Oh, chucked out randomly.

2817
02:06:54,270 --> 02:06:55,410
Oh my god.

2818
02:07:01,560 --> 02:07:02,380
Let's go.

2819
02:07:03,180 --> 02:07:03,560
Spiderman behind?

2820
02:07:06,540 --> 02:07:07,480
He's one.

2821
02:07:11,400 --> 02:07:12,620
He'll be fine, right?

2822
02:07:16,180 --> 02:07:16,740
Alright.

2823
02:07:17,600 --> 02:07:18,120
That's fine.

2824
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:19,360
Spiderman still behind us?

2825
02:07:20,760 --> 02:07:21,120
Please.

2826
02:07:22,160 --> 02:07:23,040
I don't think...

2827
02:07:26,080 --> 02:07:27,520
Oh my god, please.

2828
02:07:28,840 --> 02:07:30,440
Oh my god, where am I?

2829
02:07:38,290 --> 02:07:39,170
Alright.

2830
02:07:40,970 --> 02:07:42,450
Alright, let's go!

2831
02:07:42,890 --> 02:07:44,490
Let's go!

2832
02:07:46,130 --> 02:07:48,810
Not dead yet!

2833
02:07:52,290 --> 02:07:53,810
Magneto's full HP.

2834
02:07:55,130 --> 02:07:55,870
Oh,

2835
02:08:00,380 --> 02:08:01,280
Spiderman behind us?

2836
02:08:04,200 --> 02:08:05,600
Alright.

2837
02:08:05,600 --> 02:08:05,740
Let's go!

2838
02:08:09,750 --> 02:08:10,250
Alright.

2839
02:08:10,750 --> 02:08:11,410
That's fine.

2840
02:08:16,710 --> 02:08:19,050
Oh my god, let's fucking go, guys.

2841
02:08:19,730 --> 02:08:20,790
I'm starting to believe.

2842
02:08:21,050 --> 02:08:21,630
No, I shouldn't.

2843
02:08:21,710 --> 02:08:22,710
If I believe, we lose.

2844
02:08:23,870 --> 02:08:26,090
I need to go in with zero belief.

2845
02:08:29,150 --> 02:08:29,790
If I...

2846
02:08:30,240 --> 02:08:31,010
I can't stop.

2847
02:08:31,130 --> 02:08:32,430
I cannot start believing.

2848
02:08:32,570 --> 02:08:33,270
That's a jinx.

2849
02:08:37,830 --> 02:08:38,790
Torch your left.

2850
02:08:52,250 --> 02:08:53,230
I knew I have.

2851
02:08:53,330 --> 02:08:53,690
Oh, nevermind.

2852
02:08:57,570 --> 02:08:58,570
I can ult here.

2853
02:09:04,750 --> 02:09:06,450
I have to hide!

2854
02:09:07,130 --> 02:09:08,670
I have to hide!

2855
02:09:11,470 --> 02:09:12,350
Sylak low.

2856
02:09:15,180 --> 02:09:16,170
Adam low.

2857
02:09:20,950 --> 02:09:21,610
Woo!

2858
02:09:24,030 --> 02:09:25,370
Sylak's right on me.

2859
02:09:26,450 --> 02:09:27,010
Sylak low.

2860
02:09:30,210 --> 02:09:31,270
Oh my god!

2861
02:09:40,290 --> 02:09:41,110
Point against her right.

2862
02:09:41,290 --> 02:09:41,790
Power left.

2863
02:09:49,400 --> 02:09:51,120
This is where I die!

2864
02:09:51,460 --> 02:09:52,960
This is where I die!

2865
02:10:01,290 --> 02:10:01,970
Alright.

2866
02:10:02,550 --> 02:10:03,030
That's fine.

2867
02:10:03,170 --> 02:10:04,710
I'm fine with that.

2868
02:10:05,610 --> 02:10:07,190
I don't even know if they support...

2869
02:10:07,190 --> 02:10:09,230
They supported Adam and then...

2870
02:10:09,230 --> 02:10:10,410
I think they have...

2871
02:10:12,290 --> 02:10:12,670
Oh!

2872
02:10:15,290 --> 02:10:16,290
That's fine.

2873
02:10:18,670 --> 02:10:20,150
I need to stop believing.

2874
02:10:20,690 --> 02:10:23,510
When I don't believe, things look up for me.

2875
02:10:26,290 --> 02:10:27,430
I just got...

2876
02:10:28,790 --> 02:10:29,850
I just...

2877
02:10:29,850 --> 02:10:30,510
He's frozen.

2878
02:10:31,810 --> 02:10:32,850
Where am I?

2879
02:10:37,590 --> 02:10:37,930
Thorloak!

2880
02:10:38,030 --> 02:10:38,230
Thorloak!

2881
02:10:43,690 --> 02:10:44,310
No!

2882
02:10:44,450 --> 02:10:44,850
Okay, guys.

2883
02:10:49,710 --> 02:10:52,430
Oh my god, I'm coming in with all...

2884
02:10:59,410 --> 02:11:00,030
Alright.

2885
02:11:13,700 --> 02:11:14,200
I...

2886
02:11:14,200 --> 02:11:15,180
Should I ult this?

2887
02:11:15,540 --> 02:11:16,000
Is it winnable?

2888
02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:19,360
Oh my god.

2889
02:11:23,110 --> 02:11:24,210
Oh, I'm ulting it.

2890
02:11:26,070 --> 02:11:26,570
Oh!

2891
02:11:28,250 --> 02:11:30,230
They're gonna Sylak ult after this.

2892
02:11:35,890 --> 02:11:37,310
Both tanks are on the support.

2893
02:11:39,610 --> 02:11:40,250
McNeil low!

2894
02:11:40,310 --> 02:11:40,770
McNeil one!

2895
02:11:43,470 --> 02:11:44,210
Sylak one.

2896
02:11:44,350 --> 02:11:44,750
Left side.

2897
02:11:58,230 --> 02:11:59,230
Oh, that's huge.

2898
02:12:04,250 --> 02:12:05,190
Luna low.

2899
02:12:08,670 --> 02:12:09,390
Thor, Thor!

2900
02:12:11,810 --> 02:12:12,830
Oh my god.

2901
02:12:15,610 --> 02:12:17,730
That was a crazy game.

2902
02:12:18,630 --> 02:12:19,770
Jesus Christ.

2903
02:12:20,910 --> 02:12:22,290
I'm like, do I ult this?

2904
02:12:22,430 --> 02:12:23,090
No response.

2905
02:12:23,230 --> 02:12:24,690
I don't think my mic is working.

2906
02:12:28,270 --> 02:12:29,950
I was like...

2907
02:12:29,950 --> 02:12:30,410
Alright.

2908
02:12:33,290 --> 02:12:36,990
I was like, alright, I'm trusting my instincts!

2909
02:12:41,590 --> 02:12:43,690
Or they're ignoring me.

2910
02:12:44,030 --> 02:12:45,130
I don't know.

2911
02:12:46,010 --> 02:12:47,890
No one said anything.

2912
02:12:48,770 --> 02:12:50,710
I just trusted my...

2913
02:12:55,550 --> 02:12:56,550
Oh my god.

2914
02:12:56,590 --> 02:12:57,650
Or they're ignoring me.

2915
02:12:57,790 --> 02:12:58,330
I don't know.

2916
02:12:58,410 --> 02:12:59,390
I can never tell.

2917
02:13:00,310 --> 02:13:04,390
Guys, I can never tell if people are ignoring me or like...

2918
02:13:05,290 --> 02:13:07,810
Or like it's working.

2919
02:13:12,030 --> 02:13:12,530
Who knows?

2920
02:13:17,050 --> 02:13:18,530
Who the fuck knows?

2921
02:13:21,270 --> 02:13:23,450
Sorry, I'm used to being ignored.

2922
02:13:23,810 --> 02:13:24,310
It's okay.

2923
02:13:26,370 --> 02:13:27,490
It's okay.

2924
02:13:29,390 --> 02:13:30,170
Oh my god.

2925
02:13:33,190 --> 02:13:34,510
I'm okay.

2926
02:13:35,230 --> 02:13:35,450
Ooh.

2927
02:13:37,990 --> 02:13:39,310
There's a Thor on the supports.

2928
02:13:40,930 --> 02:13:41,550
Thor half.

2929
02:13:41,890 --> 02:13:42,510
Thor low.

2930
02:13:45,010 --> 02:13:46,150
Thor half again.

2931
02:13:52,310 --> 02:13:55,550
I'll just talk just for the sake of talking.

2932
02:14:03,630 --> 02:14:04,570
Oh.

2933
02:14:12,890 --> 02:14:13,830
Goodbye.

2934
02:14:14,970 --> 02:14:15,370
Oh.

2935
02:14:16,190 --> 02:14:16,550
Frozen?

2936
02:14:16,810 --> 02:14:17,010
Half?

2937
02:14:17,570 --> 02:14:17,790
He's low.

2938
02:14:25,310 --> 02:14:26,770
I'll ult this.

2939
02:14:28,070 --> 02:14:30,430
There's a Thor by himself on here.

2940
02:14:31,430 --> 02:14:32,690
He's half.

2941
02:14:40,310 --> 02:14:42,070
I'll stay here.

2942
02:14:43,550 --> 02:14:43,890
Alright.

2943
02:14:48,130 --> 02:14:49,290
I don't have...

2944
02:14:52,230 --> 02:14:53,470
I'm scared.

2945
02:14:55,110 --> 02:14:56,130
Thor half.

2946
02:14:56,270 --> 02:14:56,550
Thor low.

2947
02:14:59,030 --> 02:14:59,530
Okay.

2948
02:15:00,990 --> 02:15:02,170
That looks low to the left.

2949
02:15:07,340 --> 02:15:08,960
No one's talking anymore.

2950
02:15:09,020 --> 02:15:09,680
I'm by myself.

2951
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:14,020
No one's...

2952
02:15:15,780 --> 02:15:17,120
No one's talking.

2953
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:18,640
What do I do?

2954
02:15:25,860 --> 02:15:26,660
Just...

2955
02:15:26,660 --> 02:15:27,060
Lonely.

2956
02:15:30,400 --> 02:15:31,200
Lonely.

2957
02:15:33,940 --> 02:15:36,800
There was this one guy that comes.

2958
02:15:37,340 --> 02:15:38,100
But I don't know.

2959
02:15:41,680 --> 02:15:43,060
Thor is frozen.

2960
02:15:50,380 --> 02:15:52,140
If you keep me up, I can get ult.

2961
02:15:55,220 --> 02:15:55,640
Alright.

2962
02:15:57,300 --> 02:15:58,390
We fight this.

2963
02:15:59,160 --> 02:15:59,440
Yay.

2964
02:16:00,920 --> 02:16:01,500
Yay.

2965
02:16:01,780 --> 02:16:03,640
Oh, tank, you're so far away from me.

2966
02:16:07,960 --> 02:16:08,540
Alright.

2967
02:16:11,060 --> 02:16:11,640
Alright.

2968
02:16:15,440 --> 02:16:16,400
It's fine.

2969
02:16:17,180 --> 02:16:19,880
We got ults off of this, I think.

2970
02:16:19,960 --> 02:16:21,020
I don't think we did.

2971
02:16:21,460 --> 02:16:23,540
It was just mild, I think.

2972
02:16:23,540 --> 02:16:24,200
Hey!

2973
02:16:26,780 --> 02:16:27,800
There we go.

2974
02:16:35,530 --> 02:16:36,570
That's fine.

2975
02:16:39,310 --> 02:16:40,110
Oh, wait.

2976
02:16:40,630 --> 02:16:41,250
Whoa!

2977
02:16:42,350 --> 02:16:42,970
Nice.

2978
02:16:49,070 --> 02:16:49,710
Oh my god.

2979
02:16:49,770 --> 02:16:50,690
I don't know...

2980
02:16:51,270 --> 02:16:51,890
where to look.

2981
02:16:51,990 --> 02:16:52,190
Oh.

2982
02:16:55,030 --> 02:16:56,690
There's a Captain America in the supports.

2983
02:17:01,410 --> 02:17:03,370
We can't do anything.

2984
02:17:09,880 --> 02:17:10,400
Oh!

2985
02:17:11,900 --> 02:17:13,200
Can I live?

2986
02:17:13,420 --> 02:17:14,680
Let's find out!

2987
02:17:19,090 --> 02:17:22,650
Oh my...

2988
02:17:22,650 --> 02:17:23,250
That's crazy.

2989
02:17:23,330 --> 02:17:24,070
Oh, we got two picks.

2990
02:17:24,750 --> 02:17:25,470
Yeah, let's go.

2991
02:17:30,650 --> 02:17:32,070
Right side, Captain America's half.

2992
02:17:33,690 --> 02:17:34,790
Psylocke, Psylocke.

2993
02:17:34,910 --> 02:17:35,450
Psylocke's half.

2994
02:17:35,650 --> 02:17:35,930
Psylocke's one.

2995
02:17:37,750 --> 02:17:39,130
Captain America's one, too.

2996
02:17:40,270 --> 02:17:43,210
We can burst her.

2997
02:17:44,770 --> 02:17:45,290
She's low.

2998
02:17:49,690 --> 02:17:51,110
I can have all in 20.

2999
02:17:52,510 --> 02:17:53,050
Yay!

3000
02:17:56,770 --> 02:17:58,330
We did it!

3001
02:17:59,830 --> 02:18:03,410
I will never know if people could hear me or not.

3002
02:18:07,990 --> 02:18:08,550
Yay!

3003
02:18:09,610 --> 02:18:10,750
I'll never know.

3004
02:18:11,350 --> 02:18:13,690
I'll never know if my mic was working.

3005
02:18:17,750 --> 02:18:18,970
Oh my god.

3006
02:18:19,070 --> 02:18:19,910
Wait, 23.

3007
02:18:20,090 --> 02:18:20,750
That's a juicy.

3008
02:18:22,210 --> 02:18:24,510
That's actually a fucking juicy game.

3009
02:18:24,590 --> 02:18:25,170
Let's go.

3010
02:18:26,030 --> 02:18:26,410
Oh my god.

3011
02:18:26,470 --> 02:18:27,930
22k healing with three supports?

3012
02:18:28,010 --> 02:18:29,330
That's pretty fucking decent.

3013
02:18:30,550 --> 02:18:30,990
Oh.

3014
02:18:31,450 --> 02:18:33,550
I don't deserve the like, I guess.

3015
02:18:33,550 --> 02:18:33,810
Sorry.

3016
02:18:36,610 --> 02:18:37,390
You're right.

3017
02:18:37,450 --> 02:18:39,050
Our tank was pretty good, though.

3018
02:18:42,370 --> 02:18:43,290
That's alright.

3019
02:18:43,770 --> 02:18:46,330
I didn't need validation.

3020
02:18:46,950 --> 02:18:49,190
I didn't need it.

3021
02:18:49,550 --> 02:18:50,050
Alright, Reuben.

3022
02:18:50,110 --> 02:18:51,030
Did you win your game?

3023
02:18:52,550 --> 02:18:53,820
Oh shit, you did!

3024
02:18:54,190 --> 02:18:54,530
Okay.

3025
02:18:57,510 --> 02:18:58,130
Alright.

3026
02:19:00,260 --> 02:19:00,570
Alright.

3027
02:19:01,270 --> 02:19:02,910
You get to be in here.

3028
02:19:04,590 --> 02:19:05,190
Alright.

3029
02:19:05,510 --> 02:19:06,030
That had to...

3030
02:19:06,030 --> 02:19:07,090
I needed him to try.

3031
02:19:07,990 --> 02:19:11,310
It had to be like, the most try-hard thing he can do.

3032
02:19:14,270 --> 02:19:15,690
Just got full health.

3033
02:19:15,990 --> 02:19:17,150
Gonna uninstall.

3034
02:19:21,290 --> 02:19:22,630
Can you hear me?

3035
02:19:24,130 --> 02:19:25,150
Can you hear me?

3036
02:19:27,450 --> 02:19:28,050
Hello?

3037
02:19:30,730 --> 02:19:31,330
Oh.

3038
02:19:34,190 --> 02:19:35,170
Oh.

3039
02:19:37,080 --> 02:19:38,890
So they didn't hear me.

3040
02:19:40,590 --> 02:19:44,590
I was calling so well.

3041
02:19:49,340 --> 02:19:51,390
All these callouts.

3042
02:19:52,450 --> 02:19:54,290
None of them heard me.

3043
02:19:54,550 --> 02:19:58,290
I was talking to myself the entire time.

3044
02:19:59,220 --> 02:20:00,890
Oh my god.

3045
02:20:02,350 --> 02:20:02,830
Okay.

3046
02:20:04,350 --> 02:20:04,830
Hello?

3047
02:20:05,570 --> 02:20:06,930
Alright, can you hear me now?

3048
02:20:09,230 --> 02:20:10,110
Oh my god.

3049
02:20:11,310 --> 02:20:13,890
Thank you for the five gifted subs!

3050
02:20:14,250 --> 02:20:15,190
Thank you, thank you.

3051
02:20:15,430 --> 02:20:17,250
At least I wasn't ignoring, you know?

3052
02:20:17,410 --> 02:20:18,490
At least I wasn't ignoring.

3053
02:20:19,070 --> 02:20:19,410
Hello?

3054
02:20:19,690 --> 02:20:19,930
Hello?

3055
02:20:20,210 --> 02:20:20,990
Does it work now?

3056
02:20:22,310 --> 02:20:22,550
Hello?

3057
02:20:23,290 --> 02:20:24,930
Okay, but he could be fucking with us.

3058
02:20:27,190 --> 02:20:28,090
Okay, let's see.

3059
02:20:28,490 --> 02:20:29,730
Is he fucking with us?

3060
02:20:29,730 --> 02:20:30,770
Is he?

3061
02:20:31,310 --> 02:20:33,710
Is he fucking with us?

3062
02:20:37,130 --> 02:20:37,890
Alright.

3063
02:20:38,170 --> 02:20:40,190
Oh, he is.

3064
02:20:40,270 --> 02:20:41,470
Oh, they were ignoring me.

3065
02:20:41,870 --> 02:20:42,310
Oh.

3066
02:20:42,830 --> 02:20:44,390
They were ignoring me.

3067
02:20:48,490 --> 02:20:49,250
Oh.

3068
02:20:49,890 --> 02:20:51,470
I was getting ignored.

3069
02:21:01,840 --> 02:21:02,420
Oh.

3070
02:21:03,260 --> 02:21:03,840
No.

3071
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:05,260
Uh oh.

3072
02:21:07,340 --> 02:21:09,800
Alright, thank you for the five gifted subs.

3073
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:11,120
Thank you, thank you.

3074
02:21:12,280 --> 02:21:14,200
Ruben, I know they ignored me.

3075
02:21:15,600 --> 02:21:18,270
I know they ignored me, Ruben.

3076
02:21:25,780 --> 02:21:28,240
I don't hear you on his stream.

3077
02:21:28,360 --> 02:21:29,180
Wait, are you guys...

3078
02:21:29,180 --> 02:21:30,080
I can't tell!

3079
02:21:30,080 --> 02:21:31,480
I can't tell!

3080
02:21:31,740 --> 02:21:32,980
Oh, we don't hear...

3081
02:21:32,980 --> 02:21:34,140
Oh, wait, you don't hear me?

3082
02:21:34,760 --> 02:21:35,300
Okay, wait.

3083
02:21:35,500 --> 02:21:36,880
Let me rebind it then.

3084
02:21:37,220 --> 02:21:39,760
Cause sometimes it works last time.

3085
02:21:40,540 --> 02:21:42,240
Okay, let me rebind it.

3086
02:21:43,740 --> 02:21:44,380
Okay.

3087
02:21:45,100 --> 02:21:45,380
Hello?

3088
02:21:45,480 --> 02:21:45,640
Hello?

3089
02:21:47,640 --> 02:21:47,920
Hello?

3090
02:21:49,800 --> 02:21:51,780
Oh my god, are you serious?

3091
02:21:52,180 --> 02:21:52,480
Okay.

3092
02:21:53,700 --> 02:21:54,240
Let me...

3093
02:21:54,240 --> 02:21:55,660
How do I fix this?

3094
02:21:56,120 --> 02:21:56,540
Anyway.

3095
02:21:56,540 --> 02:21:56,780
Anyway.

3096
02:21:59,000 --> 02:21:59,460
Hello?

3097
02:21:59,640 --> 02:21:59,820
Hello?

3098
02:22:01,880 --> 02:22:02,340
Hello?

3099
02:22:04,200 --> 02:22:06,260
I thought he was doing his bit too.

3100
02:22:07,820 --> 02:22:09,340
Okay, I do open mic.

3101
02:22:09,400 --> 02:22:10,080
Can you hear me?

3102
02:22:12,040 --> 02:22:12,840
Oh my...

3103
02:22:12,840 --> 02:22:13,920
I have to do open mic.

3104
02:22:14,140 --> 02:22:15,340
Push to talk doesn't work.

3105
02:22:16,680 --> 02:22:17,180
Wait, okay.

3106
02:22:17,260 --> 02:22:17,720
Give me a sec.

3107
02:22:17,780 --> 02:22:18,420
Let me try this.

3108
02:22:20,720 --> 02:22:21,180
Okay.

3109
02:22:21,700 --> 02:22:23,560
It's push to talk that's fucked up.

3110
02:22:23,660 --> 02:22:25,220
Okay, let me do control then.

3111
02:22:26,540 --> 02:22:28,640
I need healing here.

3112
02:22:28,660 --> 02:22:30,000
At least I wasn't getting ignored.

3113
02:22:30,300 --> 02:22:30,780
Thank god.

3114
02:22:31,340 --> 02:22:31,740
Hello?

3115
02:22:31,960 --> 02:22:32,600
Can you hear me?

3116
02:22:34,380 --> 02:22:34,720
Hello?

3117
02:22:36,720 --> 02:22:37,240
Hello?

3118
02:22:38,220 --> 02:22:38,580
Hello?

3119
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:41,800
It's push to talk!

3120
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:44,340
It was push to talk that's not working!

3121
02:22:49,040 --> 02:22:51,540
Oh my god, I don't want to do open mic cause I'm fucking...

3122
02:22:51,540 --> 02:22:55,480
I got five gifted subs and your mic aren't working.

3123
02:22:55,480 --> 02:22:56,740
They don't even have mute!

3124
02:22:57,380 --> 02:22:58,560
Oh my god.

3125
02:22:59,200 --> 02:22:59,740
No!

3126
02:23:00,440 --> 02:23:01,260
Wait, I'm gonna restart.

3127
02:23:01,540 --> 02:23:02,080
I'll restart.

3128
02:23:02,620 --> 02:23:02,840
Okay.

3129
02:23:04,260 --> 02:23:04,820
Restarting.

3130
02:23:06,320 --> 02:23:06,600
Game.

3131
02:23:07,440 --> 02:23:07,740
Okay.

3132
02:23:08,020 --> 02:23:10,260
I can't believe you thought I...

3133
02:23:10,260 --> 02:23:11,480
I thought he was fucking with me.

3134
02:23:11,500 --> 02:23:12,960
But thank god I wasn't getting ignored.

3135
02:23:13,200 --> 02:23:14,380
I thank god.

3136
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:16,560
Restarting.

3137
02:23:16,720 --> 02:23:17,020
Game.

3138
02:23:17,120 --> 02:23:17,360
Alright.

3139
02:23:17,780 --> 02:23:18,800
Who do you think I am?

3140
02:23:19,060 --> 02:23:20,060
Alright, I'm restarting.

3141
02:23:20,060 --> 02:23:21,100
Oh my god.

3142
02:23:21,100 --> 02:23:22,940
I thought he was fucking with me, honestly.

3143
02:23:23,220 --> 02:23:23,660
I...

3144
02:23:23,660 --> 02:23:27,260
I legit thought he was fucking with me.

3145
02:23:27,360 --> 02:23:28,300
But thank god.

3146
02:23:29,420 --> 02:23:30,940
Thank god that's not the case.

3147
02:23:31,940 --> 02:23:33,060
No, it just...

3148
02:23:33,060 --> 02:23:34,190
No, Marvel Rivals...

3149
02:23:34,780 --> 02:23:36,960
Like, VC is so fucked up.

3150
02:23:37,180 --> 02:23:37,940
It's not like...

3151
02:23:37,940 --> 02:23:41,740
It's funny because everything else is so fucking well optimized.

3152
02:23:42,640 --> 02:23:45,260
Except for voice comms.

3153
02:23:45,440 --> 02:23:49,060
For some reason, voice comms is like the only thing...

3154
02:23:49,060 --> 02:23:50,660
That they have trouble with.

3155
02:23:50,940 --> 02:23:52,260
But it's like a multi...

3156
02:23:52,260 --> 02:23:53,500
That's why you don't hear people talk.

3157
02:23:53,580 --> 02:23:55,940
Because sometimes voice comms just doesn't work.

3158
02:23:59,000 --> 02:23:59,960
I'm not...

3159
02:23:59,960 --> 02:24:02,300
My mic isn't muted because open mic works.

3160
02:24:02,780 --> 02:24:03,220
Apparently.

3161
02:24:05,780 --> 02:24:08,440
Yeah, everything else is so great.

3162
02:24:08,460 --> 02:24:11,540
Except for voice comms for a multiplayer ranked game.

3163
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:13,800
Where communication is very...

3164
02:24:13,800 --> 02:24:14,300
Is key.

3165
02:24:15,240 --> 02:24:16,200
So like...

3166
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:16,880
I don't know.

3167
02:24:17,280 --> 02:24:18,240
I don't know.

3168
02:24:21,510 --> 02:24:22,510
Is it global?

3169
02:24:22,830 --> 02:24:24,470
I didn't check if it's global.

3170
02:24:27,490 --> 02:24:29,930
Yeah, it only works on open mic.

3171
02:24:30,150 --> 02:24:31,450
For some fucking reason.

3172
02:24:31,990 --> 02:24:32,770
Alright, let's check.

3173
02:24:38,550 --> 02:24:39,910
Maybe they think it's like League.

3174
02:24:40,170 --> 02:24:41,590
Where it's optional.

3175
02:24:42,170 --> 02:24:43,310
Could be, honestly.

3176
02:24:44,330 --> 02:24:46,630
I mean, someone said I should just check...

3177
02:24:46,630 --> 02:24:47,490
Oh wait, not competitive.

3178
02:24:47,670 --> 02:24:48,350
Practice range.

3179
02:24:49,490 --> 02:24:51,230
Let's check practice range real quick.

3180
02:24:51,890 --> 02:24:55,650
Sorry guys for the detour before the game starts.

3181
02:24:56,530 --> 02:24:57,770
Do I have ping?

3182
02:24:57,790 --> 02:24:58,030
Yeah.

3183
02:24:58,790 --> 02:25:00,050
I have voice comms here.

3184
02:25:00,750 --> 02:25:04,170
Oh thank god I wasn't being ignored then.

3185
02:25:04,370 --> 02:25:05,730
At least I'm not being ignored.

3186
02:25:07,810 --> 02:25:08,930
That's alright.

3187
02:25:13,290 --> 02:25:15,070
I mean, I feel a lot better now.

3188
02:25:15,130 --> 02:25:16,670
Knowing I'm not being ignored.

3189
02:25:17,070 --> 02:25:18,710
I actually feel a lot better.

3190
02:25:22,110 --> 02:25:22,490
Yeah.

3191
02:25:22,970 --> 02:25:24,370
I'm not crying.

3192
02:25:24,610 --> 02:25:26,510
I'm just happy I'm not being ignored.

3193
02:25:26,870 --> 02:25:27,270
Guys.

3194
02:25:27,670 --> 02:25:28,890
I swear.

3195
02:25:29,450 --> 02:25:32,430
I swear to god.

3196
02:25:32,590 --> 02:25:36,210
I'm just really happy that I'm not being ignored.

3197
02:25:36,650 --> 02:25:37,030
Guys.

3198
02:25:40,450 --> 02:25:41,990
That's really it.

3199
02:25:43,150 --> 02:25:44,330
Okay, need healing.

3200
02:25:44,530 --> 02:25:44,950
There you go.

3201
02:25:45,350 --> 02:25:46,870
Left control for need healing.

3202
02:25:46,870 --> 02:25:51,190
And then global should be the same.

3203
02:25:51,470 --> 02:25:53,870
Okay, here and then...

3204
02:25:54,870 --> 02:25:56,230
There we go.

3205
02:25:58,190 --> 02:25:59,410
It should work.

3206
02:26:01,070 --> 02:26:01,870
Alright.

3207
02:26:02,690 --> 02:26:03,490
Yeah!

3208
02:26:05,030 --> 02:26:07,690
I was trying so hard to communicate.

3209
02:26:08,630 --> 02:26:14,210
I actually, I worked so hard communicating with my team.

3210
02:26:14,630 --> 02:26:14,870
Hello?

3211
02:26:14,950 --> 02:26:15,190
Hello?

3212
02:26:15,530 --> 02:26:16,110
Does it work?

3213
02:26:17,890 --> 02:26:19,290
Okay, okay.

3214
02:26:19,390 --> 02:26:21,250
So, it's just...

3215
02:26:21,250 --> 02:26:22,930
I had to restart my game.

3216
02:26:24,790 --> 02:26:27,130
Are you ready?

3217
02:26:29,610 --> 02:26:31,050
If we lose...

3218
02:26:31,870 --> 02:26:33,870
If we lose, Ruben...

3219
02:26:36,750 --> 02:26:37,050
Okay.

3220
02:26:42,050 --> 02:26:43,050
Alright.

3221
02:26:43,990 --> 02:26:44,890
Alright.

3222
02:26:48,270 --> 02:26:49,150
Oh my god.

3223
02:26:51,390 --> 02:26:51,870
Alright.

3224
02:26:53,170 --> 02:26:54,130
So, like...

3225
02:26:54,130 --> 02:26:54,590
Yeah.

3226
02:26:55,650 --> 02:26:58,050
See, I'm not a coward like Mendo.

3227
02:27:00,370 --> 02:27:01,830
That's how rough it's been.

3228
02:27:06,590 --> 02:27:07,850
I'm not a coward.

3229
02:27:13,170 --> 02:27:13,970
Oh my god.

3230
02:27:14,030 --> 02:27:15,130
It's like, why did he say that?

3231
02:27:15,130 --> 02:27:15,870
We're like...

3232
02:27:20,370 --> 02:27:22,450
Why did you say that?

3233
02:27:24,430 --> 02:27:25,910
Ho, ho, ho.

3234
02:27:25,990 --> 02:27:27,290
How you guys doing?

3235
02:27:29,950 --> 02:27:33,130
Like, when I discorded Ruben, we're like...

3236
02:27:33,810 --> 02:27:35,170
A match without me.

3237
02:27:35,570 --> 02:27:36,730
Oh man, Hawkeye.

3238
02:27:36,930 --> 02:27:37,690
Fuck that guy.

3239
02:27:38,410 --> 02:27:41,270
And I'll do Hawkeye, then...

3240
02:27:41,270 --> 02:27:43,350
Bruce, if they haven't done Hella yet.

3241
02:27:45,130 --> 02:27:48,090
I say we ban Hulk, and then...

3242
02:27:48,710 --> 02:27:49,690
Hawkeye, maybe?

3243
02:27:51,130 --> 02:27:51,990
It's too late.

3244
02:27:52,730 --> 02:27:54,230
I already picked Hawkeye.

3245
02:27:55,010 --> 02:27:56,250
Oh shit, they died.

3246
02:27:57,130 --> 02:27:57,370
Haha!

3247
02:27:57,990 --> 02:27:59,130
We just wanna ban Hella then?

3248
02:27:59,930 --> 02:28:01,550
Yeah, I'm banning Hella.

3249
02:28:03,130 --> 02:28:04,810
I like how nobody's talking to him.

3250
02:28:09,750 --> 02:28:11,990
Now he gets to be ignored.

3251
02:28:15,290 --> 02:28:15,730
Haha.

3252
02:28:19,630 --> 02:28:20,930
Um, are you...

3253
02:28:20,930 --> 02:28:21,290
Perfect.

3254
02:28:21,710 --> 02:28:22,150
No.

3255
02:28:25,490 --> 02:28:25,930
Hahaha.

3256
02:28:30,230 --> 02:28:33,230
I just wanted him to talk to himself.

3257
02:28:35,090 --> 02:28:36,590
Brad, thank you for the 100 bitties.

3258
02:28:36,670 --> 02:28:37,250
Thank you, thank you.

3259
02:28:37,330 --> 02:28:39,170
Ryan, thank you for the tier 1 and the bitties.

3260
02:28:39,270 --> 02:28:40,330
Thank you, thank you.

3261
02:28:40,890 --> 02:28:41,270
Haha.

3262
02:28:42,590 --> 02:28:44,190
Now he knows how I felt.

3263
02:28:45,130 --> 02:28:46,390
Now he knows.

3264
02:28:48,370 --> 02:28:49,210
Oh, thank god.

3265
02:28:49,290 --> 02:28:50,670
I was like, do I ult, guys?

3266
02:28:50,970 --> 02:28:53,610
And then when they all, like, ignored me...

3267
02:28:53,610 --> 02:28:55,870
I really just thought that they ignored me.

3268
02:28:56,150 --> 02:28:56,930
But now I know.

3269
02:28:57,010 --> 02:28:58,130
It's cause I was just...

3270
02:28:59,750 --> 02:29:03,050
It was just cause, like, you know, nobody could hear me.

3271
02:29:03,530 --> 02:29:04,230
Thank god.

3272
02:29:04,350 --> 02:29:06,750
That made me feel a lot better, not gonna lie.

3273
02:29:07,310 --> 02:29:09,210
That made me feel so much...

3274
02:29:09,890 --> 02:29:12,870
All those comms for fucking nothing.

3275
02:29:13,350 --> 02:29:13,770
That's...

3276
02:29:15,210 --> 02:29:18,890
All those comms I did during the last two games we won...

3277
02:29:19,570 --> 02:29:20,770
For fucking nothing.

3278
02:29:21,610 --> 02:29:22,670
Let's fucking go.

3279
02:29:26,110 --> 02:29:27,210
Is East Coast...

3280
02:29:27,210 --> 02:29:28,790
No, this is Central and West Coast.

3281
02:29:29,310 --> 02:29:29,870
So, like...

3282
02:29:31,970 --> 02:29:33,010
Basically, like...

3283
02:29:33,650 --> 02:29:39,510
I don't queue East Coast cause all the Eternity and One Above All players tell me never to queue East Coast if you wanna climb.

3284
02:29:41,490 --> 02:29:43,990
So, like, I don't queue East Coast anymore.

3285
02:29:45,350 --> 02:29:47,070
Apparently, it's that bad.

3286
02:29:52,930 --> 02:29:53,490
Oh.

3287
02:29:53,970 --> 02:29:56,150
You put that on you, Lil Tink.

3288
02:29:58,550 --> 02:29:59,450
I'm gonna do this.

3289
02:30:03,650 --> 02:30:04,110
Oh.

3290
02:30:05,870 --> 02:30:07,470
Don't worry, I got you.

3291
02:30:10,270 --> 02:30:12,390
I totally got you.

3292
02:30:13,750 --> 02:30:15,690
Oh my god, where are you?

3293
02:30:15,770 --> 02:30:16,610
I don't got you.

3294
02:30:16,750 --> 02:30:17,150
Wait.

3295
02:30:17,310 --> 02:30:18,330
Wait, oh my god.

3296
02:30:18,390 --> 02:30:19,110
Wait, I was like...

3297
02:30:19,110 --> 02:30:19,570
Wait, what's that?

3298
02:30:22,030 --> 02:30:24,150
I was like, who the fuck was that?

3299
02:30:25,510 --> 02:30:27,410
Yo, they killed our Groot.

3300
02:30:28,950 --> 02:30:30,650
They killed our Groot.

3301
02:30:35,670 --> 02:30:36,270
Wait.

3302
02:30:37,710 --> 02:30:38,290
Okay.

3303
02:30:39,530 --> 02:30:39,870
Ruben's dead.

3304
02:30:39,870 --> 02:30:40,650
This is so healthy.

3305
02:30:44,550 --> 02:30:45,610
Wait, Black Panther's low.

3306
02:30:47,570 --> 02:30:48,450
Oh, nevermind.

3307
02:30:50,150 --> 02:30:51,010
Oh my god.

3308
02:30:57,230 --> 02:30:58,210
Black Panther behind.

3309
02:30:59,950 --> 02:31:01,410
Oh my god, he did it!

3310
02:31:01,510 --> 02:31:01,890
Kormi!

3311
02:31:02,090 --> 02:31:02,470
Mine's disabled.

3312
02:31:02,630 --> 02:31:03,690
I don't have it.

3313
02:31:04,930 --> 02:31:04,950
Oh.

3314
02:31:07,090 --> 02:31:09,650
Oh, please.

3315
02:31:11,170 --> 02:31:11,670
Please.

3316
02:31:13,610 --> 02:31:14,730
Please, Matop.

3317
02:31:14,810 --> 02:31:15,710
Thank god.

3318
02:31:16,450 --> 02:31:16,830
Alright.

3319
02:31:17,550 --> 02:31:19,350
I got...

3320
02:31:19,350 --> 02:31:21,270
Guys, they acknowledged me.

3321
02:31:23,830 --> 02:31:24,630
Wait, is this winnable?

3322
02:31:24,790 --> 02:31:25,150
I can ult.

3323
02:31:29,370 --> 02:31:30,750
Alright, I'll back up.

3324
02:31:34,770 --> 02:31:35,890
Oh, I need heals.

3325
02:31:37,650 --> 02:31:38,330
Luna needs heals.

3326
02:31:43,830 --> 02:31:45,030
Yeah, we played this map.

3327
02:31:45,710 --> 02:31:45,970
Okay.

3328
02:31:51,550 --> 02:31:52,570
Groot low, Groot low.

3329
02:31:53,790 --> 02:31:54,870
Breaking the Immortality.

3330
02:31:55,330 --> 02:31:56,550
Oh, Black Panther low.

3331
02:31:56,650 --> 02:31:57,350
Black Panther on me.

3332
02:31:58,270 --> 02:31:58,950
Nice.

3333
02:31:59,470 --> 02:31:59,690
Alright.

3334
02:32:00,650 --> 02:32:01,730
Tracer's just low too.

3335
02:32:02,810 --> 02:32:03,870
I'm playing behind them.

3336
02:32:09,200 --> 02:32:09,880
Yay!

3337
02:32:10,600 --> 02:32:12,560
I'm being acknowledged!

3338
02:32:14,680 --> 02:32:16,080
Oh my god!

3339
02:32:16,080 --> 02:32:16,160
Yay!

3340
02:32:19,960 --> 02:32:21,140
They acknowledged me!

3341
02:32:32,560 --> 02:32:34,020
We take space off that.

3342
02:32:34,120 --> 02:32:34,780
We should push it.

3343
02:32:38,340 --> 02:32:39,940
And since you get your ult first, you can ult first.

3344
02:32:42,500 --> 02:32:42,900
Alright.

3345
02:32:43,080 --> 02:32:44,000
Oh my god!

3346
02:32:46,200 --> 02:32:46,540
He's out.

3347
02:32:49,780 --> 02:32:50,780
Oh, Psylocke one.

3348
02:32:52,040 --> 02:32:52,960
Oh my god.

3349
02:32:57,240 --> 02:32:58,400
Black Panther and Psylocke behind us.

3350
02:32:58,660 --> 02:32:59,360
Black Panther one.

3351
02:33:06,720 --> 02:33:07,660
Oh my god.

3352
02:33:10,020 --> 02:33:10,840
That's fine!

3353
02:33:11,960 --> 02:33:12,880
That's fine!

3354
02:33:15,100 --> 02:33:16,480
There's a Dr. Street behind us.

3355
02:33:18,700 --> 02:33:19,600
Oh my god!

3356
02:33:19,760 --> 02:33:20,520
Don't worry!

3357
02:33:20,660 --> 02:33:22,000
I dance!

3358
02:33:23,640 --> 02:33:24,680
I dance!

3359
02:33:27,960 --> 02:33:28,760
Nice.

3360
02:33:32,380 --> 02:33:33,460
Black Panther.

3361
02:33:35,500 --> 02:33:35,760
Okay.

3362
02:33:36,980 --> 02:33:37,780
Nice!

3363
02:33:39,800 --> 02:33:40,040
Shit.

3364
02:33:40,840 --> 02:33:41,080
Woo!

3365
02:33:42,180 --> 02:33:43,420
Fuck you, Loki!

3366
02:33:44,020 --> 02:33:46,040
My voice is being heard!

3367
02:33:49,180 --> 02:33:50,380
Let's go.

3368
02:33:52,360 --> 02:33:53,560
Let's go.

3369
02:33:53,700 --> 02:33:54,640
Wait, Wraith Strider's here.

3370
02:33:54,800 --> 02:33:55,160
There's two?

3371
02:34:02,810 --> 02:34:03,310
Nice.

3372
02:34:04,950 --> 02:34:06,170
I'm gonna ult early again here.

3373
02:34:06,970 --> 02:34:07,430
Dreamchase.

3374
02:34:10,550 --> 02:34:11,850
They have Panther ult.

3375
02:34:12,730 --> 02:34:13,170
Ulting?

3376
02:34:21,070 --> 02:34:21,570
Nice!

3377
02:34:25,990 --> 02:34:27,050
I'm missing everything!

3378
02:34:27,170 --> 02:34:27,790
I'm missing everything!

3379
02:34:28,490 --> 02:34:29,550
But that's okay!

3380
02:34:29,630 --> 02:34:30,130
Oh, he used it!

3381
02:34:30,890 --> 02:34:31,130
Ha!

3382
02:34:31,790 --> 02:34:32,290
Yippee!

3383
02:34:32,910 --> 02:34:34,910
He doesn't know I missed all my shots.

3384
02:34:34,970 --> 02:34:36,190
He's not gonna look at the replay.

3385
02:34:36,190 --> 02:34:37,830
Ha ha ha ha!

3386
02:34:40,530 --> 02:34:41,970
He doesn't know!

3387
02:34:42,990 --> 02:34:44,070
He doesn't know!

3388
02:34:46,090 --> 02:34:48,430
Oh, I'm dead.

3389
02:34:50,650 --> 02:34:51,790
Ha ha ha ha!

3390
02:34:53,950 --> 02:34:55,570
I only- We should use nothing here.

3391
02:34:58,610 --> 02:34:59,210
Goodbye.

3392
02:35:03,210 --> 02:35:03,890
He has two ults.

3393
02:35:03,950 --> 02:35:04,910
We can just Mantis in.

3394
02:35:10,550 --> 02:35:11,950
That's fine, guys!

3395
02:35:12,210 --> 02:35:14,050
Oh my god, I sound so, like, nice.

3396
02:35:14,410 --> 02:35:14,750
Ha ha!

3397
02:35:14,830 --> 02:35:17,050
Like, as in, like, really a nice person.

3398
02:35:17,450 --> 02:35:17,610
What?

3399
02:35:17,810 --> 02:35:18,410
Ha ha ha!

3400
02:35:18,470 --> 02:35:19,470
And I'm comming!

3401
02:35:19,690 --> 02:35:22,070
And inside, I'm like, I hate you all.

3402
02:35:22,470 --> 02:35:23,350
Ha ha ha ha!

3403
02:35:25,590 --> 02:35:27,670
I just sound so, like, polite.

3404
02:35:28,330 --> 02:35:28,850
Ha ha ha!

3405
02:35:31,670 --> 02:35:33,070
We should Mantis in, I think.

3406
02:35:34,790 --> 02:35:35,190
Oh!

3407
02:35:35,650 --> 02:35:36,650
Oh, I guess not!

3408
02:35:36,770 --> 02:35:37,390
Fuck me!

3409
02:35:37,390 --> 02:35:39,230
Just don't listen to me, I guess.

3410
02:35:39,710 --> 02:35:40,910
Ha ha ha ha!

3411
02:35:42,210 --> 02:35:45,270
Who cares what I think, I guess?

3412
02:35:51,090 --> 02:35:52,810
Alright, let's go!

3413
02:35:53,530 --> 02:35:56,250
Who cares what I think?

3414
02:35:56,850 --> 02:35:58,730
That's fucking right!

3415
02:36:01,290 --> 02:36:02,570
That's right!

3416
02:36:02,730 --> 02:36:04,910
Who fucking cares?

3417
02:36:09,160 --> 02:36:10,440
There's a Psylocke behind us.

3418
02:36:10,560 --> 02:36:10,980
She has ult.

3419
02:36:11,820 --> 02:36:12,560
She's one.

3420
02:36:12,740 --> 02:36:14,640
Psylocke's one, Psylocke's one.

3421
02:36:16,400 --> 02:36:17,180
Okay, sounds strange.

3422
02:36:22,670 --> 02:36:24,150
Uh, Groot?

3423
02:36:25,210 --> 02:36:26,170
Yippee!

3424
02:36:28,530 --> 02:36:31,150
Who cares what I think?

3425
02:36:32,110 --> 02:36:33,630
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3426
02:36:34,430 --> 02:36:36,650
Is my mic bugged again?

3427
02:36:40,210 --> 02:36:41,170
Oh...

3428
02:36:41,170 --> 02:36:41,950
It's alright.

3429
02:36:42,930 --> 02:36:43,670
It's okay.

3430
02:36:44,850 --> 02:36:46,150
I guess...

3431
02:36:46,150 --> 02:36:47,810
My mic went out again?

3432
02:36:48,630 --> 02:36:50,170
Ha ha ha ha!

3433
02:36:51,310 --> 02:36:52,210
His works?

3434
02:36:52,830 --> 02:36:54,130
What is his work?

3435
02:36:54,470 --> 02:36:58,140
Ha ha ha ha!

3436
02:36:58,380 --> 02:36:59,700
Ha ha ha ha!

3437
02:37:00,400 --> 02:37:04,080
Were you talking the entire round?

3438
02:37:04,980 --> 02:37:06,500
Cause I heard nothing.

3439
02:37:06,840 --> 02:37:08,100
Ha ha ha ha!

3440
02:37:09,920 --> 02:37:11,160
Ha ha ha ha!

3441
02:37:13,260 --> 02:37:14,280
We'll see.

3442
02:37:14,440 --> 02:37:14,800
No?

3443
02:37:15,400 --> 02:37:15,820
Okay.

3444
02:37:15,820 --> 02:37:17,700
But did you hear me?

3445
02:37:18,100 --> 02:37:18,900
Ha ha ha ha!

3446
02:37:20,760 --> 02:37:21,520
Alright.

3447
02:37:24,480 --> 02:37:25,360
Alright, we'll see.

3448
02:37:25,480 --> 02:37:26,220
We'll figure it out.

3449
02:37:26,600 --> 02:37:27,820
You talked once.

3450
02:37:27,980 --> 02:37:28,500
Oh!

3451
02:37:29,100 --> 02:37:29,860
Alright.

3452
02:37:30,780 --> 02:37:32,140
It's just bugged.

3453
02:37:33,060 --> 02:37:33,480
Alright.

3454
02:37:34,280 --> 02:37:34,960
Ha ha ha!

3455
02:37:37,820 --> 02:37:39,700
Oh my god!

3456
02:37:40,140 --> 02:37:40,640
No!

3457
02:37:41,800 --> 02:37:45,120
I hate the voice comms in this game.

3458
02:37:47,020 --> 02:37:49,120
I hate it so much.

3459
02:37:50,120 --> 02:37:50,820
Ha ha ha!

3460
02:37:53,180 --> 02:37:53,900
Alright.

3461
02:37:54,800 --> 02:37:55,960
Comms are just cooked.

3462
02:37:56,560 --> 02:37:59,880
No wonder the Mantis didn't fucking listen to me.

3463
02:38:02,540 --> 02:38:06,840
No wonder everything makes so much more sense now.

3464
02:38:08,140 --> 02:38:09,640
I was like, aw man.

3465
02:38:10,680 --> 02:38:11,940
That's fine.

3466
02:38:12,200 --> 02:38:14,280
You don't need to talk to me.

3467
02:38:15,400 --> 02:38:16,440
That's fine.

3468
02:38:16,700 --> 02:38:19,720
I don't need to be acknowledged.

3469
02:38:20,120 --> 02:38:20,980
Starlord behind me.

3470
02:38:26,220 --> 02:38:27,280
Jesus Christ.

3471
02:38:27,720 --> 02:38:28,220
Jesus.

3472
02:38:28,860 --> 02:38:29,460
Christ.

3473
02:38:30,520 --> 02:38:31,900
Oh my god.

3474
02:38:33,860 --> 02:38:37,120
Hey, at least they like, looked at it even though they can't hear me.

3475
02:38:37,400 --> 02:38:38,520
You know, that's fine.

3476
02:38:38,920 --> 02:38:40,040
I'm okay with that.

3477
02:38:40,460 --> 02:38:41,240
Ha ha ha!

3478
02:38:43,840 --> 02:38:45,120
That's like something.

3479
02:38:45,120 --> 02:38:46,840
Oh, goodbye.

3480
02:38:47,460 --> 02:38:49,160
He was not gonna live.

3481
02:38:49,320 --> 02:38:50,400
Oh, goodbye.

3482
02:38:51,500 --> 02:38:52,580
Let me get back up here.

3483
02:38:53,620 --> 02:38:55,160
If they could hear me.

3484
02:38:59,270 --> 02:39:00,790
Oh my god!

3485
02:39:02,070 --> 02:39:02,650
I'm ulting this.

3486
02:39:03,470 --> 02:39:05,090
Oh, sorry Mantis.

3487
02:39:06,270 --> 02:39:08,010
If you could hear me.

3488
02:39:08,590 --> 02:39:09,590
Ha ha ha ha!

3489
02:39:10,470 --> 02:39:12,410
We double- I didn't realize you.

3490
02:39:17,240 --> 02:39:18,160
Yep, brutal.

3491
02:39:21,940 --> 02:39:22,540
Okay.

3492
02:39:22,800 --> 02:39:29,200
I was not trusting him to- Oh my god.

3493
02:39:30,240 --> 02:39:31,060
That's fine.

3494
02:39:33,640 --> 02:39:35,020
That's so fine.

3495
02:39:36,040 --> 02:39:37,660
Comm's just dead in general.

3496
02:39:37,880 --> 02:39:38,740
Let's- That's fine.

3497
02:39:39,420 --> 02:39:40,280
Who cares?

3498
02:39:40,400 --> 02:39:41,760
We don't need to communicate.

3499
02:39:42,500 --> 02:39:47,680
Who needs to communicate in that fuck- If we can't communicate, the enemy team can't communicate.

3500
02:39:47,680 --> 02:39:50,600
Like- Ha ha ha ha!

3501
02:39:52,120 --> 02:39:57,540
Like- If- If like a gank is- If- You know what?

3502
02:39:57,560 --> 02:39:58,380
I'll take that.

3503
02:39:58,640 --> 02:40:00,140
I'll fucking take that, honestly.

3504
02:40:00,680 --> 02:40:01,920
Ha ha ha!

3505
02:40:03,120 --> 02:40:04,680
That means he-

3506
02:40:07,760 --> 02:40:10,320
Oh my god, he's so healthy!

3507
02:40:10,580 --> 02:40:11,740
You're so healthy!

3508
02:40:12,400 --> 02:40:14,140
I clapped and you lived!

3509
02:40:14,460 --> 02:40:16,180
That's how the world works!

3510
02:40:17,260 --> 02:40:19,460
Technology is beautiful!

3511
02:40:21,580 --> 02:40:23,400
I clapped and you're alive!

3512
02:40:25,520 --> 02:40:26,340
There we go.

3513
02:40:27,960 --> 02:40:28,980
Everything is okay.

3514
02:40:30,180 --> 02:40:31,620
No again for you.

3515
02:40:32,380 --> 02:40:33,220
Oh, I can ult first.

3516
02:40:33,300 --> 02:40:36,520
Oh my god, I build my ult so fast compared to Archmantis.

3517
02:40:40,270 --> 02:40:41,310
This is what I mean.

3518
02:40:41,390 --> 02:40:46,550
Like, everything is perfect except for the fact that, you know, communicating is not.

3519
02:40:46,550 --> 02:40:50,070
I'm not gonna be open micing this up, guys!

3520
02:40:50,290 --> 02:40:55,430
I don't need them to hear my fucking thought process when I'm playing.

3521
02:40:56,450 --> 02:40:59,370
Like, they're gonna be hearing me fucking breathe and everything.

3522
02:40:59,510 --> 02:41:00,670
Like, mouth breathing.

3523
02:41:01,690 --> 02:41:03,250
Oh my god, they went Iron Fist.

3524
02:41:03,330 --> 02:41:04,050
You're fucking mad.

3525
02:41:07,150 --> 02:41:08,830
Alright, alright, that's cool.

3526
02:41:09,270 --> 02:41:09,710
You know what?

3527
02:41:09,970 --> 02:41:11,230
Fuck it, let's go.

3528
02:41:12,130 --> 02:41:13,090
Let's go!

3529
02:41:13,570 --> 02:41:16,270
Let's- Yeah, let's- Yeah, let's go.

3530
02:41:16,390 --> 02:41:17,970
I knew- I was so confident.

3531
02:41:18,310 --> 02:41:19,770
We don't have any synergy.

3532
02:41:20,030 --> 02:41:25,390
I didn't realize our Mantis got ult already.

3533
02:41:25,630 --> 02:41:26,510
It's fine.

3534
02:41:26,930 --> 02:41:27,470
What are we gonna do?

3535
02:41:27,550 --> 02:41:28,910
Lose it with no support ult?

3536
02:41:29,210 --> 02:41:29,950
That's fine.

3537
02:41:30,210 --> 02:41:31,110
Double support ult?

3538
02:41:31,590 --> 02:41:32,770
That's fine.

3539
02:41:34,950 --> 02:41:36,690
We have two tank ults.

3540
02:41:36,910 --> 02:41:38,950
We just don't- We just don't get rooted.

3541
02:41:40,190 --> 02:41:40,750
See?

3542
02:41:41,070 --> 02:41:42,330
Just don't get rooted.

3543
02:41:42,650 --> 02:41:43,870
It's just that easy.

3544
02:41:45,170 --> 02:41:46,770
We got rooted, guys.

3545
02:41:46,990 --> 02:41:47,730
But we live.

3546
02:41:47,910 --> 02:41:48,590
We live those.

3547
02:41:49,370 --> 02:41:50,070
We live those.

3548
02:41:50,290 --> 02:41:51,450
Oh my god!

3549
02:41:52,050 --> 02:41:53,470
We live those.

3550
02:41:54,110 --> 02:41:55,250
We- Oh.

3551
02:41:55,690 --> 02:41:59,810
We definitely- Oh, please.

3552
02:42:00,370 --> 02:42:01,590
We- Oh!

3553
02:42:03,950 --> 02:42:04,590
Oh!

3554
02:42:05,630 --> 02:42:06,990
Just so you know.

3555
02:42:07,810 --> 02:42:10,750
It doesn't matter if I had support ult there.

3556
02:42:11,230 --> 02:42:13,150
It doesn't- It doesn't matter.

3557
02:42:13,150 --> 02:42:17,670
Like, you can't live- You can't live through, uh- Ha!

3558
02:42:17,990 --> 02:42:19,490
Whatever we just saw there.

3559
02:42:20,790 --> 02:42:21,350
Oh.

3560
02:42:21,530 --> 02:42:22,130
Oh, we're portaling?

3561
02:42:23,910 --> 02:42:24,750
It'll be fun, yeah.

3562
02:42:30,350 --> 02:42:31,190
I believe.

3563
02:42:31,410 --> 02:42:31,890
I believe.

3564
02:42:33,570 --> 02:42:34,070
Groot low.

3565
02:42:34,150 --> 02:42:34,470
Groot low.

3566
02:42:35,030 --> 02:42:36,190
Let's go!

3567
02:42:37,390 --> 02:42:38,350
Let's go!

3568
02:42:42,170 --> 02:42:44,170
I don't think they can get back in time.

3569
02:42:44,170 --> 02:42:45,790
Ha ha ha!

3570
02:42:48,270 --> 02:42:49,810
We're back in.

3571
02:42:50,250 --> 02:42:52,230
In GM1.

3572
02:42:52,670 --> 02:42:53,830
We're back in it.

3573
02:42:54,370 --> 02:42:55,370
I'm sorry, Doki.

3574
02:42:55,490 --> 02:42:56,990
I'm feeling- I tried!

3575
02:42:58,450 --> 02:42:59,230
Ha ha ha!

3576
02:42:59,690 --> 02:43:01,830
No, I was trolling.

3577
02:43:02,090 --> 02:43:03,150
Ha ha ha!

3578
02:43:04,070 --> 02:43:06,470
Mantis ult always first.

3579
02:43:06,810 --> 02:43:07,590
Ha ha ha!

3580
02:43:08,330 --> 02:43:10,970
But I knew- Ha ha ha!

3581
02:43:10,970 --> 02:43:15,230
I- But I knew we were better.

3582
02:43:15,610 --> 02:43:16,850
Ha ha ha!

3583
02:43:21,900 --> 02:43:23,800
Mantis ult is always first.

3584
02:43:24,880 --> 02:43:26,820
But, like, I- I was fucking her.

3585
02:43:26,960 --> 02:43:30,780
I was like, there's no way we lose this, right?

3586
02:43:31,200 --> 02:43:32,480
There's no- Okay.

3587
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:34,220
Alright, let's see.

3588
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:36,260
Wait, was I heard?

3589
02:43:36,540 --> 02:43:37,660
Is my mic working?

3590
02:43:39,120 --> 02:43:39,580
Hello?

3591
02:43:39,580 --> 02:43:39,780
Hello?

3592
02:43:41,120 --> 02:43:41,800
Ruben?

3593
02:43:43,220 --> 02:43:43,900
Ruben?

3594
02:43:44,840 --> 02:43:45,720
It's moving!

3595
02:43:46,540 --> 02:43:49,340
Guys, the mic is literally moving!

3596
02:43:52,080 --> 02:43:54,320
It's- Do you not see this move?

3597
02:43:55,640 --> 02:43:58,300
Do you not see this move?

3598
02:43:58,500 --> 02:44:00,180
I saw it move!

3599
02:44:01,520 --> 02:44:02,680
Oh my god.

3600
02:44:02,920 --> 02:44:13,260
The only time I actually like- I'm willing to play- One of the few times, I'm like, so down to communicate with my team and- Hello?

3601
02:44:13,560 --> 02:44:14,440
Is my mic working?

3602
02:44:18,520 --> 02:44:19,160
Hello?

3603
02:44:20,840 --> 02:44:21,380
Hello?

3604
02:44:24,700 --> 02:44:25,340
Wait.

3605
02:44:27,020 --> 02:44:28,500
Is he ignoring me?

3606
02:44:29,440 --> 02:44:30,160
Oh, I'm- Okay.

3607
02:44:31,100 --> 02:44:32,200
Okay, no, he's not.

3608
02:44:32,300 --> 02:44:32,620
Okay.

3609
02:44:33,560 --> 02:44:34,840
It's not working?

3610
02:44:34,840 --> 02:44:36,920
Oh my god.

3611
02:44:37,300 --> 02:44:39,840
Oh my god.

3612
02:44:40,060 --> 02:44:41,380
I'm mad.

3613
02:44:44,820 --> 02:44:45,420
Hello?

3614
02:44:46,200 --> 02:44:47,340
Can you hear me?

3615
02:44:50,240 --> 02:44:51,600
Is my mic completely broken?

3616
02:44:53,460 --> 02:45:02,840
Are you se- Oh my god, bro, I never get to play- This is like the most detour of queuing because I never get to play because my microphone's broken.

3617
02:45:02,840 --> 02:45:05,100
I fucking- Life sucks.

3618
02:45:08,580 --> 02:45:10,980
Life is not bueno, guys.

3619
02:45:12,240 --> 02:45:13,980
Life is just not bueno.

3620
02:45:17,080 --> 02:45:22,060
We never get to actually play the game.

3621
02:45:24,680 --> 02:45:27,460
Oh my- I think it's mostly me.

3622
02:45:27,840 --> 02:45:29,340
I'm pretty sure.

3623
02:45:29,340 --> 02:45:36,060
I'm pretty sure it's mostly me because like, everybody- Okay, no, actually no.

3624
02:45:36,280 --> 02:45:39,340
Because like, sometimes it works and sometimes it just doesn't.

3625
02:45:41,720 --> 02:45:44,680
It's like- Yeah, voice chat keeps breaking.

3626
02:45:44,860 --> 02:45:45,400
Oh, whatever.

3627
02:45:45,740 --> 02:45:46,140
Fuck it.

3628
02:45:46,220 --> 02:45:47,020
I'll just keep comming.

3629
02:45:47,080 --> 02:45:47,920
If it works, it works.

3630
02:45:52,100 --> 02:45:55,920
If people hear me, then that's like the plus side.

3631
02:45:58,700 --> 02:46:00,140
No, it's the game.

3632
02:46:00,300 --> 02:46:04,860
The game literally bugs out when it comes to voice comms.

3633
02:46:05,700 --> 02:46:07,380
If they hear me, they hear me.

3634
02:46:07,440 --> 02:46:09,220
If they don't hear me, that's just life.

3635
02:46:10,600 --> 02:46:12,100
Alright, I need to get water real quick.

3636
02:46:12,180 --> 02:46:12,940
I'll be right back, guys.

3637
02:46:44,820 --> 02:46:45,880
Alright, I got water.

3638
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:49,640
Alright, that's just life.

3639
02:46:49,960 --> 02:46:53,760
If they don't hear me, I guess I'll just...

3640
02:46:56,080 --> 02:46:56,840
die...

3641
02:46:56,840 --> 02:46:57,360
in game.

3642
02:46:58,340 --> 02:46:59,660
I might be the only GM one.

3643
02:46:59,700 --> 02:47:00,740
I'm gonna lose so much.

3644
02:47:01,960 --> 02:47:07,480
Alright, we have a rocket one trick.

3645
02:47:09,080 --> 02:47:10,660
Damn, banning Mantis.

3646
02:47:17,130 --> 02:47:20,070
How many sidelock one tricks are there anyway?

3647
02:47:21,810 --> 02:47:23,450
Unless you diff.

3648
02:47:29,210 --> 02:47:31,710
If not, I'm fucking banning this guy.

3649
02:47:35,550 --> 02:47:36,150
Alright.

3650
02:47:39,310 --> 02:47:39,610
Then...

3651
02:47:40,130 --> 02:47:41,790
I'm banning Mantis.

3652
02:47:43,130 --> 02:47:43,730
Okay.

3653
02:47:44,710 --> 02:47:47,270
If we have a rocket raccoon one trick, then I feel...

3654
02:47:47,270 --> 02:47:47,870
Oh my god.

3655
02:47:49,070 --> 02:47:50,990
How does his mic work?

3656
02:47:51,090 --> 02:47:52,090
That's not fair.

3657
02:47:56,110 --> 02:47:57,310
That's not...

3658
02:47:59,190 --> 02:48:01,390
He gets to say it all.

3659
02:48:01,590 --> 02:48:02,830
Oh, thank god Luna's banned.

3660
02:48:02,950 --> 02:48:04,350
Then I can play Mantis.

3661
02:48:05,090 --> 02:48:06,230
I'm okay with that.

3662
02:48:06,990 --> 02:48:08,430
I'm actually okay that they banned Luna.

3663
02:48:08,650 --> 02:48:09,770
Just so I can play Mantis.

3664
02:48:11,350 --> 02:48:12,770
Let's hope this guy diffs him.

3665
02:48:12,870 --> 02:48:13,250
Oh, wait.

3666
02:48:13,350 --> 02:48:13,510
Okay.

3667
02:48:15,450 --> 02:48:15,830
Alright.

3668
02:48:17,690 --> 02:48:19,590
Luna Mantis is just way too good.

3669
02:48:20,050 --> 02:48:22,490
It's just way too good to like...

3670
02:48:23,270 --> 02:48:24,470
to like avoid it.

3671
02:48:27,350 --> 02:48:29,030
Alright, here we go.

3672
02:48:30,730 --> 02:48:32,510
Please switch if anything.

3673
02:48:35,110 --> 02:48:36,470
What does that even mean?

3674
02:48:37,930 --> 02:48:40,090
Please switch if anything.

3675
02:48:40,930 --> 02:48:42,770
Yes, I'm GM one!

3676
02:48:43,250 --> 02:48:43,810
Yes!

3677
02:48:44,490 --> 02:48:45,350
I am.

3678
02:48:47,050 --> 02:48:49,150
I am GM one now.

3679
02:48:50,730 --> 02:48:51,470
No, Adam is.

3680
02:48:51,730 --> 02:48:53,090
Adam is definitely a lot better.

3681
02:48:53,410 --> 02:48:54,570
But like, what can you do?

3682
02:48:54,570 --> 02:48:55,770
We have a rocket one trick.

3683
02:48:57,410 --> 02:48:59,650
Like, what can you do?

3684
02:49:02,130 --> 02:49:03,850
Just gotta play around with one tricks.

3685
02:49:04,230 --> 02:49:09,310
The thing is, he gets to fucking enjoy being one trick because who the fuck bans Rocket Raccoon?

3686
02:49:09,510 --> 02:49:13,450
It's such a shitty support character that no one fucking bans him.

3687
02:49:15,030 --> 02:49:16,710
I actually have to flex.

3688
02:49:17,370 --> 02:49:21,190
I learn every other support except for Rocket because who fucking plays Rocket?

3689
02:49:21,190 --> 02:49:21,970
Who?

3690
02:49:23,770 --> 02:49:26,770
Who fucking bans Rocket Raccoon?

3691
02:49:28,470 --> 02:49:35,070
Like, I'm flexing because like I'm willing to learn other support because I'm no fucking one trick.

3692
02:49:37,370 --> 02:49:38,090
Alright.

3693
02:49:38,930 --> 02:49:40,650
Let me get a damage boost here.

3694
02:49:42,590 --> 02:49:44,370
Oh my god!

3695
02:49:44,990 --> 02:49:46,590
Oh my god!

3696
02:49:47,630 --> 02:49:49,370
Oh my god!

3697
02:49:50,230 --> 02:49:50,970
Oh my god!

3698
02:49:50,970 --> 02:49:53,310
I like, I don't know what you want me to do.

3699
02:49:53,430 --> 02:49:56,030
You guys are all so low.

3700
02:49:58,990 --> 02:50:00,590
Like, oh my god.

3701
02:50:01,590 --> 02:50:03,070
Wouldn't it be funny if I got that?

3702
02:50:03,230 --> 02:50:03,730
Yeah, I did.

3703
02:50:04,310 --> 02:50:05,370
But it doesn't matter anyway.

3704
02:50:06,670 --> 02:50:07,810
Doesn't fucking matter.

3705
02:50:08,950 --> 02:50:09,430
Please.

3706
02:50:10,010 --> 02:50:11,310
Please let me heal you.

3707
02:50:11,510 --> 02:50:12,570
Oh my god.

3708
02:50:12,630 --> 02:50:13,390
Please let me heal you.

3709
02:50:15,070 --> 02:50:16,170
Got a headshot though.

3710
02:50:16,590 --> 02:50:17,030
That's cool.

3711
02:50:18,030 --> 02:50:18,550
That's cool.

3712
02:50:19,890 --> 02:50:21,850
Oh, that's not cool anymore.

3713
02:50:22,070 --> 02:50:22,850
Guys, it's not fair.

3714
02:50:22,930 --> 02:50:23,750
They have double tank.

3715
02:50:24,570 --> 02:50:26,810
It's actually, oh wait, no, they have Magneto.

3716
02:50:26,970 --> 02:50:27,910
Wait, that's not fair.

3717
02:50:27,990 --> 02:50:28,770
They have a shield.

3718
02:50:29,450 --> 02:50:30,950
That's actually not fair.

3719
02:50:32,130 --> 02:50:35,650
Guys, I wish I had a shield.

3720
02:50:36,030 --> 02:50:38,150
I wish I had a shield tank.

3721
02:50:40,290 --> 02:50:44,550
I thought they were running double tank, but they were just running a shield, which is objectively a better...

3722
02:50:45,210 --> 02:50:46,570
Oh, I broke the Ankh.

3723
02:50:46,570 --> 02:50:47,810
I did my job.

3724
02:50:50,610 --> 02:50:51,890
I did my job.

3725
02:50:52,330 --> 02:50:53,170
I broke the Ankh.

3726
02:50:56,670 --> 02:50:57,190
Please.

3727
02:50:58,390 --> 02:50:59,610
Oh my god, please.

3728
02:51:00,690 --> 02:51:02,630
I can't even...

3729
02:51:02,630 --> 02:51:03,730
Alright, fuck it.

3730
02:51:03,750 --> 02:51:04,350
Let's go.

3731
02:51:04,890 --> 02:51:05,950
Oh, it doesn't matter.

3732
02:51:06,530 --> 02:51:07,050
Everybody...

3733
02:51:07,050 --> 02:51:08,670
Wait, why did you all...

3734
02:51:08,670 --> 02:51:11,870
Why did you all leave my ult?

3735
02:51:12,010 --> 02:51:13,010
I can't live!

3736
02:51:17,790 --> 02:51:18,470
Clearly...

3737
02:51:18,470 --> 02:51:22,210
Clearly, if they didn't leave my ult, I would have lived.

3738
02:51:22,350 --> 02:51:23,790
That's like the worst part.

3739
02:51:24,790 --> 02:51:26,470
Oh my god.

3740
02:51:26,790 --> 02:51:28,310
I had no more leaves.

3741
02:51:28,390 --> 02:51:29,170
I'm sorry.

3742
02:51:33,770 --> 02:51:35,550
I'm so sorry.

3743
02:51:36,330 --> 02:51:41,430
I can't get headshot because they're all fucking double shielded up!

3744
02:51:41,430 --> 02:51:42,110
Oh my god.

3745
02:51:42,290 --> 02:51:48,530
What do you want me to do?

3746
02:51:51,200 --> 02:51:52,870
Oh my god.

3747
02:51:53,010 --> 02:51:53,570
Okay.

3748
02:51:55,110 --> 02:51:55,730
Alright.

3749
02:51:57,210 --> 02:51:58,390
Alright.

3750
02:52:01,670 --> 02:52:04,350
Here we go.

3751
02:52:05,090 --> 02:52:10,990
I'm not I'm not I'm not copying because...

3752
02:52:14,110 --> 02:52:15,750
I'm sorry, bro.

3753
02:52:17,590 --> 02:52:18,710
I'm sorry.

3754
02:52:18,990 --> 02:52:21,170
Like, I don't know what else to do for you.

3755
02:52:23,450 --> 02:52:24,010
Like...

3756
02:52:24,870 --> 02:52:25,990
Like, I'm...

3757
02:52:26,670 --> 02:52:29,070
I'm trying so hard to keep you up, bro.

3758
02:52:29,290 --> 02:52:30,750
I really am.

3759
02:52:36,910 --> 02:52:38,230
Here we go.

3760
02:52:38,230 --> 02:52:42,150
I can't even damage boost a rob because...

3761
02:52:42,150 --> 02:52:42,590
Oh, that's huge!

3762
02:52:43,450 --> 02:52:45,370
That's huge, but I can't do anything about it!

3763
02:52:45,490 --> 02:52:46,810
Because he's shielding everything!

3764
02:52:47,610 --> 02:52:48,090
There we go.

3765
02:52:50,350 --> 02:52:51,150
Please, no!

3766
02:52:56,290 --> 02:52:57,250
Oh my god.

3767
02:52:57,390 --> 02:52:59,050
I believe in this rocky raccoon.

3768
02:53:00,210 --> 02:53:00,890
You know what?

3769
02:53:01,190 --> 02:53:01,770
Fuck it.

3770
02:53:04,410 --> 02:53:05,290
Okay, there we go.

3771
02:53:05,890 --> 02:53:06,770
There we go.

3772
02:53:07,390 --> 02:53:07,990
Please.

3773
02:53:08,650 --> 02:53:09,150
Anything.

3774
02:53:10,350 --> 02:53:11,590
Please, anything.

3775
02:53:14,610 --> 02:53:16,390
Oh my god.

3776
02:53:16,850 --> 02:53:17,330
Anything.

3777
02:53:19,430 --> 02:53:20,030
Alright.

3778
02:53:20,870 --> 02:53:21,470
Please.

3779
02:53:22,290 --> 02:53:23,070
Oh my god.

3780
02:53:23,110 --> 02:53:23,790
Please, anything.

3781
02:53:24,750 --> 02:53:26,370
I'm so proud of all you guys.

3782
02:53:26,930 --> 02:53:28,610
I'm so proud of you guys.

3783
02:53:32,540 --> 02:53:35,680
I didn't sedate because I was waiting for an ult to sedate it for it.

3784
02:53:36,940 --> 02:53:38,280
Because it's like...

3785
02:53:38,280 --> 02:53:41,280
It's scary to waste your sedate and then they ult at you.

3786
02:53:41,800 --> 02:53:43,120
So I was worried about that.

3787
02:53:47,440 --> 02:53:49,500
That's why I didn't sedate yet.

3788
02:53:49,660 --> 02:53:54,040
I used my sedate a lot because sedating is such a game clutch thing.

3789
02:53:55,200 --> 02:53:56,380
Game clutch mechanic.

3790
02:53:58,020 --> 02:54:00,000
I can't just sedate whenever I want.

3791
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:00,800
Hahaha.

3792
02:54:02,760 --> 02:54:03,540
Ah!

3793
02:54:03,580 --> 02:54:05,360
Fucking Alarak, goodbye.

3794
02:54:06,100 --> 02:54:06,880
Goodbye.

3795
02:54:11,040 --> 02:54:11,810
It's okay.

3796
02:54:14,030 --> 02:54:17,590
There's like no reason to come, honestly, for this game.

3797
02:54:18,950 --> 02:54:20,990
Right now, there's like...

3798
02:54:20,990 --> 02:54:22,510
Like, I'm...

3799
02:54:22,510 --> 02:54:25,250
I'm not confident about this team, not gonna lie.

3800
02:54:25,670 --> 02:54:26,370
Hahaha.

3801
02:54:26,370 --> 02:54:26,390
Hahaha.

3802
02:54:30,090 --> 02:54:31,490
Oh my god.

3803
02:54:32,110 --> 02:54:32,970
Where is she?

3804
02:54:37,590 --> 02:54:38,690
There we go.

3805
02:54:39,090 --> 02:54:39,430
See?

3806
02:54:39,610 --> 02:54:41,610
This is why I save my sedates.

3807
02:54:43,150 --> 02:54:44,450
This is exactly why.

3808
02:54:46,850 --> 02:54:47,610
Please.

3809
02:54:48,130 --> 02:54:49,350
Please peek me.

3810
02:54:53,450 --> 02:54:54,190
Leave!

3811
02:54:54,430 --> 02:54:54,770
Leave!

3812
02:54:54,970 --> 02:54:55,350
Leave!

3813
02:54:55,550 --> 02:54:56,130
Hahaha.

3814
02:54:57,390 --> 02:54:58,150
Leave!

3815
02:54:58,150 --> 02:54:59,410
Hahaha.

3816
02:55:01,810 --> 02:55:04,330
Goddamn, when I have no leaves, it's so scary.

3817
02:55:05,350 --> 02:55:06,110
Nice.

3818
02:55:06,690 --> 02:55:07,250
Alright.

3819
02:55:08,390 --> 02:55:08,870
Nice.

3820
02:55:09,530 --> 02:55:10,090
I'll put three.

3821
02:55:12,590 --> 02:55:13,150
Alright.

3822
02:55:14,070 --> 02:55:14,670
It's okay.

3823
02:55:14,890 --> 02:55:15,690
I have ult here.

3824
02:55:17,410 --> 02:55:18,170
And...

3825
02:55:18,170 --> 02:55:19,930
We're gonna have...

3826
02:55:19,930 --> 02:55:21,110
Moguito ult.

3827
02:55:25,390 --> 02:55:26,150
Reload.

3828
02:55:27,790 --> 02:55:28,570
Alright.

3829
02:55:30,290 --> 02:55:31,070
Alright.

3830
02:55:31,430 --> 02:55:31,530
Alright.

3831
02:55:31,820 --> 02:55:32,650
Let's go!

3832
02:55:34,370 --> 02:55:35,510
Oh, fuck.

3833
02:55:35,710 --> 02:55:36,240
I could've...

3834
02:55:39,190 --> 02:55:39,570
Alright.

3835
02:55:40,230 --> 02:55:41,090
That's a whale.

3836
02:55:44,730 --> 02:55:47,890
Yeah, I'm not fucking letting that happen.

3837
02:55:48,530 --> 02:55:48,990
I'm...

3838
02:55:48,990 --> 02:55:49,410
Alright.

3839
02:55:50,950 --> 02:55:51,550
Nice.

3840
02:55:51,750 --> 02:55:52,450
I'm alive.

3841
02:55:53,230 --> 02:55:54,410
That's fine.

3842
02:55:54,790 --> 02:55:56,650
I can let that happen, though.

3843
02:55:56,650 --> 02:55:57,090
I...

3844
02:55:57,090 --> 02:55:58,970
I'll be back.

3845
02:55:59,050 --> 02:55:59,690
I gotta fix my frame.

3846
02:56:00,230 --> 02:56:00,590
What?

3847
02:56:02,630 --> 02:56:03,270
What?

3848
02:56:04,370 --> 02:56:05,390
Excuse me?

3849
02:56:07,850 --> 02:56:08,490
What?

3850
02:56:13,670 --> 02:56:15,290
Oh, he's back.

3851
02:56:15,410 --> 02:56:15,730
Okay.

3852
02:56:15,830 --> 02:56:17,750
I was gonna be like excuse me.

3853
02:56:17,930 --> 02:56:20,830
But what do you mean by that?

3854
02:56:20,830 --> 02:56:22,290
Oh, it's you.

3855
02:56:26,710 --> 02:56:27,430
Alright.

3856
02:56:27,930 --> 02:56:28,550
That's fine.

3857
02:56:32,670 --> 02:56:33,390
Goodbye.

3858
02:56:34,290 --> 02:56:35,630
If you live, you live.

3859
02:56:38,170 --> 02:56:38,890
What?

3860
02:56:39,010 --> 02:56:39,830
That doesn't hit?

3861
02:56:40,730 --> 02:56:41,630
I'll just die.

3862
02:56:42,050 --> 02:56:42,530
It's fine.

3863
02:56:43,510 --> 02:56:44,390
It's fine.

3864
02:56:45,250 --> 02:56:46,570
That should've hit.

3865
02:56:50,720 --> 02:56:52,160
He was like, give me a sec.

3866
02:56:52,200 --> 02:56:53,280
I gotta text my friend.

3867
02:56:53,880 --> 02:56:54,780
And I was like, what?

3868
02:56:55,860 --> 02:56:56,560
Are we...

3869
02:56:56,560 --> 02:56:58,180
What do you mean?

3870
02:56:59,160 --> 02:56:59,300
Oh.

3871
02:57:00,300 --> 02:57:00,760
Alright.

3872
02:57:06,820 --> 02:57:07,660
Alright.

3873
02:57:10,660 --> 02:57:11,100
Let's go.

3874
02:57:14,360 --> 02:57:16,320
I'm fucking okay!

3875
02:57:17,300 --> 02:57:19,240
I went left.

3876
02:57:20,500 --> 02:57:21,640
You guys alright?

3877
02:57:25,240 --> 02:57:26,320
Don't worry.

3878
02:57:26,480 --> 02:57:27,840
I'm fucking wow!

3879
02:57:28,200 --> 02:57:28,620
I made it!

3880
02:57:28,780 --> 02:57:32,360
I just made it.

3881
02:57:32,680 --> 02:57:33,140
Alright.

3882
02:57:36,480 --> 02:57:36,960
Alright.

3883
02:57:47,010 --> 02:57:48,790
Oh my god.

3884
02:57:51,210 --> 02:57:51,770
Alright.

3885
02:57:51,970 --> 02:57:51,970
Alright.

3886
02:57:51,970 --> 02:57:52,490
That's fine.

3887
02:57:55,450 --> 02:57:55,990
I'm asleep.

3888
02:58:00,240 --> 02:58:01,160
Tyler behind.

3889
02:58:01,760 --> 02:58:02,100
Tyler one.

3890
02:58:02,180 --> 02:58:02,540
Tyler one.

3891
02:58:09,550 --> 02:58:10,110
Okay.

3892
02:58:10,230 --> 02:58:10,550
Nice.

3893
02:58:12,930 --> 02:58:14,090
Oh my god.

3894
02:58:14,130 --> 02:58:14,830
There we go.

3895
02:58:17,850 --> 02:58:18,410
Yay!

3896
02:58:21,530 --> 02:58:26,230
I don't know if you can hear me, but like I calmed a little bit there.

3897
02:58:26,630 --> 02:58:27,570
Oh my god.

3898
02:58:27,650 --> 02:58:29,070
What a fucking...

3899
02:58:29,070 --> 02:58:30,610
Somehow we did it.

3900
02:58:30,690 --> 02:58:31,950
Oh my accuracy is so bad.

3901
02:58:32,050 --> 02:58:34,530
I'm like, I haven't played Mantis in a bit on stream.

3902
02:58:36,210 --> 02:58:38,410
My accuracy is so bad right now.

3903
02:58:39,050 --> 02:58:40,410
I was not hitting shit.

3904
02:58:44,710 --> 02:58:45,710
It's fine.

3905
02:58:46,050 --> 02:58:47,030
Everything's okay.

3906
02:58:47,770 --> 02:58:50,850
I hope I get to... I hope I get to play Adam today on stream.

3907
02:58:52,650 --> 02:58:54,890
I think my Adam was like pretty good.

3908
02:58:55,290 --> 02:58:56,350
Not a good female.

3909
02:58:56,850 --> 02:58:58,430
I'm not one of the good ones, guys.

3910
02:58:59,350 --> 02:59:02,050
34% accuracy is pretty fucking ass.

3911
02:59:04,050 --> 02:59:04,650
Yeah.

3912
02:59:06,430 --> 02:59:08,690
My mic is broken again, I think.

3913
02:59:14,630 --> 02:59:16,010
I've accepted it.

3914
02:59:20,850 --> 02:59:22,390
I've accepted it.

3915
02:59:23,970 --> 02:59:24,490
Yeah.

3916
02:59:28,450 --> 02:59:28,970
Sad.

3917
02:59:33,990 --> 02:59:36,210
It is what it is.

3918
02:59:37,070 --> 02:59:38,650
Would you ditch Luna for Mantis?

3919
02:59:38,730 --> 02:59:39,050
No.

3920
02:59:39,290 --> 02:59:40,330
Luna's so easy.

3921
02:59:41,230 --> 02:59:43,210
She's honestly so fucking easy.

3922
02:59:43,330 --> 02:59:47,850
You don't have to have aim to be able to play Luna well, but like if you have aim, then that's a bonus.

3923
02:59:47,850 --> 02:59:49,850
Because like her...

3924
02:59:49,850 --> 02:59:53,970
A good Luna is someone that can freeze almost every dive they get.

3925
02:59:55,470 --> 02:59:57,710
And like because I used to play Ana in Overwatch.

3926
02:59:57,950 --> 03:00:00,110
It's like... It's even easier.

3927
03:00:01,350 --> 03:00:03,710
It's even easier than Ana.

3928
03:00:04,030 --> 03:00:04,950
Her freezes.

3929
03:00:05,810 --> 03:00:07,850
Because like Ana's sleep is...

3930
03:00:13,650 --> 03:00:14,730
Oh no.

3931
03:00:17,130 --> 03:00:18,050
She got bubble.

3932
03:00:22,250 --> 03:00:23,350
Oh my god.

3933
03:00:26,370 --> 03:00:27,350
Oh my god.

3934
03:00:27,430 --> 03:00:28,170
This is scary.

3935
03:00:31,430 --> 03:00:32,350
Oh my god.

3936
03:00:32,390 --> 03:00:33,470
My aim is so bad right now.

3937
03:00:35,530 --> 03:00:36,130
I...

3938
03:00:36,130 --> 03:00:37,710
Oh shit.

3939
03:00:38,750 --> 03:00:39,190
Oh.

3940
03:00:41,350 --> 03:00:41,950
Okay.

3941
03:00:48,180 --> 03:00:48,780
Okay.

3942
03:00:48,820 --> 03:00:51,080
I want to play back here if I can.

3943
03:00:55,510 --> 03:00:55,870
Please.

3944
03:00:56,650 --> 03:00:56,790
No!

3945
03:00:57,030 --> 03:00:57,270
No!

3946
03:00:57,490 --> 03:00:57,830
No!

3947
03:00:58,050 --> 03:00:58,470
No!

3948
03:00:58,690 --> 03:00:59,890
You fucker!

3949
03:01:04,150 --> 03:01:05,770
Oh my god!

3950
03:01:14,640 --> 03:01:15,360
Bro!

3951
03:01:19,340 --> 03:01:21,480
I could have killed him!

3952
03:01:22,300 --> 03:01:23,040
I could have!

3953
03:01:23,420 --> 03:01:24,300
He did it!

3954
03:01:24,680 --> 03:01:25,640
Oh my god.

3955
03:01:25,700 --> 03:01:26,780
I'm so sad.

3956
03:01:27,520 --> 03:01:31,020
I'm so sad that he woke him up.

3957
03:01:33,120 --> 03:01:34,520
You fucker.

3958
03:01:35,120 --> 03:01:36,560
I could have lived.

3959
03:01:37,260 --> 03:01:39,740
I could have fucking lived!

3960
03:01:41,640 --> 03:01:43,240
Actually fucked me.

3961
03:01:43,840 --> 03:01:47,440
He actually fucked me over with that.

3962
03:01:49,180 --> 03:01:50,920
I feel like the...

3963
03:01:50,920 --> 03:01:52,680
Project my ping must be... Oh wait.

3964
03:01:52,740 --> 03:01:52,940
No.

3965
03:01:56,510 --> 03:01:57,430
Thank god.

3966
03:01:57,430 --> 03:01:58,450
Nevermind.

3967
03:01:58,790 --> 03:01:59,410
That's West Coast.

3968
03:01:59,590 --> 03:02:01,010
No, I don't work for those people.

3969
03:02:01,890 --> 03:02:02,030
Oh.

3970
03:02:04,170 --> 03:02:06,530
I'm never on West Coast server even though.

3971
03:02:07,870 --> 03:02:08,790
Go damage!

3972
03:02:10,130 --> 03:02:11,130
I'm just bad I guess.

3973
03:02:19,710 --> 03:02:20,270
I'm sorry.

3974
03:02:20,690 --> 03:02:21,370
I didn't mean to.

3975
03:02:24,030 --> 03:02:25,350
He doesn't see me.

3976
03:02:25,410 --> 03:02:26,190
No, he sees me.

3977
03:02:26,290 --> 03:02:26,610
No!

3978
03:02:26,810 --> 03:02:27,810
He's so low!

3979
03:02:29,750 --> 03:02:31,110
He's so low!

3980
03:02:33,570 --> 03:02:34,570
Oh my god.

3981
03:02:34,690 --> 03:02:34,990
Nice.

3982
03:02:35,890 --> 03:02:36,530
Goodbye.

3983
03:02:36,850 --> 03:02:37,470
Punisher.

3984
03:02:38,110 --> 03:02:40,790
That's a good fucking defense though.

3985
03:02:41,290 --> 03:02:42,390
Should I fully back up?

3986
03:02:45,810 --> 03:02:46,490
Oh my god.

3987
03:02:46,590 --> 03:02:47,790
It went lower.

3988
03:02:51,130 --> 03:02:52,910
I swear to god!

3989
03:02:53,290 --> 03:02:54,330
You better kill him!

3990
03:02:58,450 --> 03:03:01,990
You better fucking kill him if you're gonna wake him up!

3991
03:03:11,130 --> 03:03:12,310
Oh my god.

3992
03:03:13,070 --> 03:03:14,570
You better fucking kill him.

3993
03:03:14,770 --> 03:03:16,090
I swear to god.

3994
03:03:16,950 --> 03:03:18,350
Oh my god.

3995
03:03:18,510 --> 03:03:18,830
I guess.

3996
03:03:19,250 --> 03:03:20,650
I guess.

3997
03:03:20,890 --> 03:03:21,190
Okay.

3998
03:03:21,850 --> 03:03:22,670
I'm cool.

3999
03:03:26,840 --> 03:03:27,840
I'm gonna check.

4000
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:29,480
I need to double check if I need to ult.

4001
03:03:29,720 --> 03:03:30,640
I don't think I do.

4002
03:03:30,640 --> 03:03:30,700
Oh.

4003
03:03:31,460 --> 03:03:31,940
Nice.

4004
03:03:32,080 --> 03:03:32,240
Okay.

4005
03:03:38,040 --> 03:03:38,700
Come on.

4006
03:03:38,860 --> 03:03:39,220
Kill him!

4007
03:03:39,220 --> 03:03:39,700
Kill him!

4008
03:03:39,740 --> 03:03:40,320
He's so low!

4009
03:03:42,160 --> 03:03:42,640
Okay.

4010
03:03:42,720 --> 03:03:43,080
Nice.

4011
03:03:44,660 --> 03:03:48,540
I was like, I swear to fucking god, if you don't kill him...

4012
03:03:48,540 --> 03:03:50,360
I'm like, my aim is like...

4013
03:03:50,360 --> 03:03:51,700
I feel like I'm playing Luna.

4014
03:03:51,900 --> 03:03:54,240
I haven't played Mantis in a while.

4015
03:03:55,320 --> 03:03:58,500
So like, my aim is not good on Mantis right now.

4016
03:04:00,180 --> 03:04:02,060
I've been playing Luna way too much.

4017
03:04:02,060 --> 03:04:04,060
Her projectile is so different from...

4018
03:04:04,580 --> 03:04:06,220
Because Luna's hitscan...

4019
03:04:06,220 --> 03:04:07,780
So like, oh my god.

4020
03:04:07,800 --> 03:04:09,660
I'm fucking so bad on Mantis at the moment.

4021
03:04:09,760 --> 03:04:11,420
I usually get like 40% accuracy.

4022
03:04:11,980 --> 03:04:14,500
40% like, average accuracy.

4023
03:04:15,980 --> 03:04:18,620
But like, it's not doing so well right now.

4024
03:04:19,180 --> 03:04:21,920
I'm not doing so well right now.

4025
03:04:25,500 --> 03:04:26,060
Please.

4026
03:04:26,540 --> 03:04:27,960
I don't have leaves.

4027
03:04:32,460 --> 03:04:33,560
It's okay.

4028
03:04:34,360 --> 03:04:37,900
Too much Luna does makes me a bad player.

4029
03:04:41,900 --> 03:04:43,960
But I wanna.

4030
03:04:46,960 --> 03:04:47,860
Hide me.

4031
03:04:48,120 --> 03:04:48,440
Oh wait.

4032
03:04:50,580 --> 03:04:51,540
Everything is fine.

4033
03:04:51,740 --> 03:04:52,420
Damage boost.

4034
03:04:53,920 --> 03:04:54,560
Heal.

4035
03:04:54,560 --> 03:04:54,940
Heal.

4036
03:04:54,940 --> 03:04:56,940
You're all so healthy.

4037
03:04:58,140 --> 03:04:59,300
Damage boost.

4038
03:05:01,040 --> 03:05:01,840
Heal.

4039
03:05:02,840 --> 03:05:03,820
You're so healthy.

4040
03:05:05,460 --> 03:05:06,260
Damage.

4041
03:05:06,420 --> 03:05:06,660
Oh!

4042
03:05:06,920 --> 03:05:07,140
Heal!

4043
03:05:07,440 --> 03:05:07,680
Heal!

4044
03:05:08,580 --> 03:05:08,980
Damage!

4045
03:05:09,320 --> 03:05:09,740
Heal!

4046
03:05:10,300 --> 03:05:11,120
Damage boost!

4047
03:05:12,020 --> 03:05:13,500
Oh my god, you're so healthy!

4048
03:05:14,800 --> 03:05:15,320
Heal!

4049
03:05:16,180 --> 03:05:16,600
Heal!

4050
03:05:19,580 --> 03:05:20,380
Oh!

4051
03:05:21,340 --> 03:05:21,940
No!

4052
03:05:24,840 --> 03:05:30,140
I need two people in my ult to live through it.

4053
03:05:32,220 --> 03:05:40,960
The thing about like, Mantis' ult is that the more people in your ult, the more healing it does.

4054
03:05:41,440 --> 03:05:43,320
But I had no one near me.

4055
03:05:43,440 --> 03:05:45,600
I had no one next to me.

4056
03:05:46,620 --> 03:05:47,860
I'm not sure.

4057
03:05:48,140 --> 03:05:49,440
I don't think so.

4058
03:05:50,260 --> 03:05:51,820
That's so sad.

4059
03:05:51,900 --> 03:05:53,280
I'm so sad.

4060
03:05:53,900 --> 03:05:57,760
There were not enough people to fucking let me live.

4061
03:05:58,700 --> 03:06:02,460
If I had enough people on it, I could actually have lived that.

4062
03:06:04,620 --> 03:06:06,280
I mean, you all split up too.

4063
03:06:08,180 --> 03:06:09,240
That was my bad.

4064
03:06:09,340 --> 03:06:10,520
I should not have been split up there.

4065
03:06:11,640 --> 03:06:13,400
It's okay, I got you.

4066
03:06:17,920 --> 03:06:18,880
It's fine.

4067
03:06:19,360 --> 03:06:20,380
Who needs it?

4068
03:06:20,560 --> 03:06:21,300
Damage boost him.

4069
03:06:23,260 --> 03:06:23,860
Please.

4070
03:06:24,620 --> 03:06:25,980
I'm not hitting anything.

4071
03:06:28,340 --> 03:06:29,460
But you can.

4072
03:06:29,820 --> 03:06:31,320
You can hit for me, right?

4073
03:06:33,840 --> 03:06:35,460
Oh my god, he's so low.

4074
03:06:36,680 --> 03:06:38,800
Oh my god.

4075
03:06:39,360 --> 03:06:39,760
Nice.

4076
03:06:41,400 --> 03:06:42,100
Whip him!

4077
03:06:42,360 --> 03:06:42,960
Whip him!

4078
03:06:43,200 --> 03:06:44,220
That's fucking right!

4079
03:06:44,380 --> 03:06:45,040
Whip him!

4080
03:06:45,520 --> 03:06:45,960
Hahaha.

4081
03:06:48,300 --> 03:06:49,580
I'm not using this yet.

4082
03:06:52,680 --> 03:06:53,700
Oh fuck, nice.

4083
03:06:54,500 --> 03:06:55,500
Okay, not nice.

4084
03:06:57,080 --> 03:06:58,240
I need to wait for my Lee's.

4085
03:07:01,280 --> 03:07:02,940
Don't worry, I'm not using that yet.

4086
03:07:03,240 --> 03:07:03,940
I don't have to.

4087
03:07:07,600 --> 03:07:08,620
Oh my god, please.

4088
03:07:08,980 --> 03:07:10,020
I don't have to use it yet.

4089
03:07:10,940 --> 03:07:12,600
You can get healed for now.

4090
03:07:13,760 --> 03:07:14,440
That's right.

4091
03:07:17,080 --> 03:07:17,940
Oh my bad.

4092
03:07:19,940 --> 03:07:20,580
It's last fight.

4093
03:07:25,600 --> 03:07:26,720
Oh, yeah.

4094
03:07:27,380 --> 03:07:31,340
I thought this could be last fight and then we could kill people, but we didn't.

4095
03:07:31,740 --> 03:07:32,580
So that's fine.

4096
03:07:33,140 --> 03:07:34,460
I'm okay with that.

4097
03:07:35,680 --> 03:07:37,440
I'm okay with that, guys.

4098
03:07:41,480 --> 03:07:43,980
He didn't know where I was, thank god.

4099
03:07:47,580 --> 03:07:48,140
Oh.

4100
03:07:52,060 --> 03:07:53,380
Oh my god, he's getting healed.

4101
03:07:53,660 --> 03:07:54,480
He's getting healed.

4102
03:07:54,660 --> 03:07:54,880
No!

4103
03:07:57,180 --> 03:07:58,760
He got healed!

4104
03:07:59,380 --> 03:08:02,740
Yeah, they used Starlord ult, they used Psylocke ult, they used...

4105
03:08:03,380 --> 03:08:03,880
No!

4106
03:08:05,280 --> 03:08:06,360
Yeah, he did.

4107
03:08:06,840 --> 03:08:07,320
Their Starlord.

4108
03:08:09,340 --> 03:08:10,440
Oh my god, okay.

4109
03:08:17,520 --> 03:08:18,080
Alright.

4110
03:08:18,080 --> 03:08:19,500
Why?

4111
03:08:20,240 --> 03:08:21,300
Oh my god, why?

4112
03:08:22,600 --> 03:08:23,320
Why?

4113
03:08:24,180 --> 03:08:25,380
Wait, what?

4114
03:08:25,540 --> 03:08:26,820
Why did no one dodge that?

4115
03:08:28,320 --> 03:08:30,040
Why did our fucking...

4116
03:08:30,040 --> 03:08:32,080
Why did our fucking strange...

4117
03:08:33,020 --> 03:08:36,080
Our strange move in a portal...

4118
03:08:36,760 --> 03:08:39,740
I didn't know what went in.

4119
03:08:40,540 --> 03:08:41,560
I don't...

4120
03:08:42,080 --> 03:08:44,240
I'm so confused.

4121
03:08:44,240 --> 03:08:44,780
I'm so confused.

4122
03:08:46,500 --> 03:08:48,480
Why did no one go in?

4123
03:08:52,160 --> 03:08:55,020
I was like, surely one of them is gonna touch, right?

4124
03:08:56,160 --> 03:09:00,040
Surely we had fucking Psylocke ult and everything.

4125
03:09:00,280 --> 03:09:02,460
Surely one of you guys are gonna...

4126
03:09:02,460 --> 03:09:08,220
Bro, our strange opened a TP instead of fucking contesting point.

4127
03:09:08,860 --> 03:09:11,060
Why the fuck did he open portal?

4128
03:09:11,060 --> 03:09:13,120
I was like, opening a portal.

4129
03:09:13,260 --> 03:09:14,020
I'm like, excuse me?

4130
03:09:16,460 --> 03:09:18,220
Oh my god, that's crazy.

4131
03:09:18,460 --> 03:09:21,560
Just seeing our strange open a portal instead of contesting the payload.

4132
03:09:21,960 --> 03:09:24,160
Literally like, I'm so confused.

4133
03:09:24,820 --> 03:09:26,480
So fucking confused.

4134
03:09:28,260 --> 03:09:28,660
Alright.

4135
03:09:31,960 --> 03:09:34,380
No, he like, stayed in portal for...

4136
03:09:35,700 --> 03:09:36,740
That's the thing.

4137
03:09:36,840 --> 03:09:38,120
He actually stayed there.

4138
03:09:38,740 --> 03:09:40,040
I was like, okay.

4139
03:09:41,340 --> 03:09:41,980
Okay.

4140
03:09:47,180 --> 03:09:48,560
Alright, here we go.

4141
03:09:49,460 --> 03:09:51,100
Also, dad, thank you for the twitch prom.

4142
03:09:51,240 --> 03:09:52,020
Thank you.

4143
03:09:52,120 --> 03:09:54,180
I'll take this then.

4144
03:09:55,660 --> 03:09:55,980
Alright.

4145
03:09:56,540 --> 03:09:58,000
This portal won't be that bad.

4146
03:10:00,900 --> 03:10:01,180
Alright.

4147
03:10:01,540 --> 03:10:02,180
One.

4148
03:10:02,400 --> 03:10:03,020
Two.

4149
03:10:03,700 --> 03:10:04,340
Three.

4150
03:10:05,920 --> 03:10:06,560
One.

4151
03:10:08,720 --> 03:10:10,420
Oh, somebody's sleeping.

4152
03:10:10,420 --> 03:10:10,720
Sleeping.

4153
03:10:14,360 --> 03:10:17,880
Alright, strange.

4154
03:10:18,800 --> 03:10:19,600
Strange.

4155
03:10:20,020 --> 03:10:20,820
Strange.

4156
03:10:22,300 --> 03:10:22,880
Where?

4157
03:10:23,400 --> 03:10:24,100
Who's shooting me?

4158
03:10:24,320 --> 03:10:25,460
Who's shooting me?

4159
03:10:25,800 --> 03:10:32,600
I'm sorry, I couldn't tell who the fuck was shooting me.

4160
03:10:35,160 --> 03:10:35,960
Here we go.

4161
03:10:39,930 --> 03:10:40,910
Here we go.

4162
03:10:41,150 --> 03:10:43,050
Here we go.

4163
03:10:44,810 --> 03:10:46,530
Bro, I- my mouse face.

4164
03:10:47,250 --> 03:10:48,350
I- I can't.

4165
03:10:56,930 --> 03:10:57,310
Alright.

4166
03:10:59,590 --> 03:11:00,230
Focus him.

4167
03:11:00,570 --> 03:11:01,290
Focus him!

4168
03:11:01,530 --> 03:11:01,970
Nice.

4169
03:11:02,490 --> 03:11:04,150
I'm gonna fucking- Oh, chaser!

4170
03:11:04,410 --> 03:11:04,850
Chaser!

4171
03:11:05,750 --> 03:11:06,830
Oh my god.

4172
03:11:06,950 --> 03:11:08,970
He's all over the- No, I'm fucking disoriented.

4173
03:11:09,110 --> 03:11:10,590
I might need like, a five minute break.

4174
03:11:10,670 --> 03:11:12,330
My eyes are like, crossing eyes.

4175
03:11:19,790 --> 03:11:20,890
Oh my god.

4176
03:11:20,970 --> 03:11:21,450
He jumped.

4177
03:11:21,850 --> 03:11:23,390
Our rocket raccoon is jumping.

4178
03:11:23,490 --> 03:11:24,430
I have to stay on the cart.

4179
03:11:24,810 --> 03:11:26,110
He's actually- He's jumping.

4180
03:11:26,430 --> 03:11:28,110
He's actually jumping.

4181
03:11:28,450 --> 03:11:29,410
No, I'm not good.

4182
03:11:29,690 --> 03:11:30,770
I'm not good.

4183
03:11:32,590 --> 03:11:34,350
I'm getting like, disoriented.

4184
03:11:35,770 --> 03:11:36,330
Oh,

4185
03:11:39,730 --> 03:11:40,030
nice.

4186
03:11:41,030 --> 03:11:41,710
That's right!

4187
03:11:41,830 --> 03:11:43,890
Now he knows how I felt!

4188
03:11:49,030 --> 03:11:52,810
Now they know how I felt when I had to deal with it.

4189
03:11:56,630 --> 03:11:57,270
Okay.

4190
03:12:00,350 --> 03:12:01,890
We're all staying together, right?

4191
03:12:06,770 --> 03:12:07,410
Wow!

4192
03:12:09,130 --> 03:12:09,730
Oh my

4193
03:12:15,420 --> 03:12:17,720
- That's fine.

4194
03:12:17,960 --> 03:12:18,780
That's fine.

4195
03:12:18,900 --> 03:12:19,700
I'm on it.

4196
03:12:19,800 --> 03:12:20,580
That's fine.

4197
03:12:21,460 --> 03:12:23,560
That's- Oh my god.

4198
03:12:24,920 --> 03:12:26,120
Oh my god.

4199
03:12:26,180 --> 03:12:28,460
My aim is not good on Mantis, right?

4200
03:12:28,520 --> 03:12:29,120
I'm sorry.

4201
03:12:29,460 --> 03:12:30,460
I swear.

4202
03:12:31,180 --> 03:12:34,560
I have 40% average accuracy on Mantis.

4203
03:12:34,760 --> 03:12:35,740
I swear to god.

4204
03:12:35,920 --> 03:12:38,480
Just today's not- This game is not it.

4205
03:12:38,540 --> 03:12:41,060
I've been playing Luna for like, nine hours straight.

4206
03:12:41,500 --> 03:12:44,020
I've been like, Luna and Adam, nine hours straight.

4207
03:12:44,200 --> 03:12:44,900
That's just-

4208
03:12:47,980 --> 03:12:49,040
Today's not it.

4209
03:12:49,260 --> 03:12:50,960
I swear to god.

4210
03:12:50,960 --> 03:12:53,780
My Mantis is a lot better than this.

4211
03:12:53,860 --> 03:12:55,320
I swear to god, chat.

4212
03:12:59,670 --> 03:13:01,370
Oh my god.

4213
03:13:03,970 --> 03:13:05,470
Oh, I'm shot at it.

4214
03:13:05,650 --> 03:13:06,630
I swear.

4215
03:13:06,970 --> 03:13:10,250
I will pull up my fucking Mantis replays.

4216
03:13:10,330 --> 03:13:13,010
I have to prove to you guys that I can play Mantis.

4217
03:13:13,110 --> 03:13:13,990
I swear to god.

4218
03:13:19,230 --> 03:13:23,590
I will pull up my Mantis replays to prove to you guys.

4219
03:13:28,890 --> 03:13:32,530
Also, for all everyone new here who's watching for the very first time, my name is Doki.

4220
03:13:32,630 --> 03:13:38,030
I usually stream on YouTube, but since I'm doing the Marble Rivals grind, I'm on Twitch right now.

4221
03:13:38,190 --> 03:13:40,510
I'm mostly streaming the grind on Twitch.

4222
03:13:42,510 --> 03:13:42,850
Alright.

4223
03:13:44,530 --> 03:13:48,210
I think it's also because I'm like, just hyped up on Caffeine and stuff.

4224
03:13:48,210 --> 03:13:53,630
So, I usually play on high ground, but I want damage boost for my team, honestly.

4225
03:13:55,650 --> 03:13:58,470
They are definitely not TPing.

4226
03:14:07,750 --> 03:14:08,890
I don't know.

4227
03:14:08,970 --> 03:14:11,630
I feel like I should play here, but...

4228
03:14:12,990 --> 03:14:16,410
Because I need range to...

4229
03:14:16,410 --> 03:14:17,850
get five.

4230
03:14:21,670 --> 03:14:22,650
They're so five.

4231
03:14:22,650 --> 03:14:24,310
Oh, I'm not.

4232
03:14:24,470 --> 03:14:25,430
I'm backing up now.

4233
03:14:26,750 --> 03:14:28,250
I'm slowly backing up.

4234
03:14:31,470 --> 03:14:33,070
I'm slowly backing up here.

4235
03:14:34,410 --> 03:14:35,050
Wait.

4236
03:14:35,650 --> 03:14:36,070
Okay.

4237
03:14:38,490 --> 03:14:38,990
Whoa!

4238
03:14:39,930 --> 03:14:40,750
I swear!

4239
03:14:40,850 --> 03:14:41,930
Oh my god, okay.

4240
03:14:42,550 --> 03:14:42,930
Okay.

4241
03:14:43,470 --> 03:14:46,090
I was gonna say, I swear to god of you.

4242
03:14:46,650 --> 03:14:51,410
Oh no.

4243
03:14:51,410 --> 03:14:52,890
Oh no.

4244
03:14:53,190 --> 03:14:54,490
Oh big, thank you.

4245
03:14:57,070 --> 03:14:58,190
Wait, what?

4246
03:14:58,310 --> 03:14:59,130
That didn't hit?

4247
03:15:01,330 --> 03:15:02,410
Still losable.

4248
03:15:05,730 --> 03:15:07,110
Oh my god.

4249
03:15:07,290 --> 03:15:07,930
There we go.

4250
03:15:12,090 --> 03:15:12,690
Okay.

4251
03:15:15,550 --> 03:15:18,810
Oh, I don't have leaves!

4252
03:15:18,870 --> 03:15:19,630
I'm so sorry!

4253
03:15:26,040 --> 03:15:27,460
Oh shit, nice!

4254
03:15:28,300 --> 03:15:28,760
Yeah!

4255
03:15:32,680 --> 03:15:34,560
I swear!

4256
03:15:35,280 --> 03:15:36,460
Oh my god.

4257
03:15:37,300 --> 03:15:38,200
We did it.

4258
03:15:39,680 --> 03:15:41,100
We're good.

4259
03:15:41,640 --> 03:15:42,660
Don't look at my accuracy.

4260
03:15:43,760 --> 03:15:45,420
But we're good.

4261
03:15:48,300 --> 03:15:50,700
Give me five minutes.

4262
03:15:50,700 --> 03:15:50,800
Give me five minutes.

4263
03:15:53,900 --> 03:15:57,420
I need to reset myself a little bit.

4264
03:16:00,120 --> 03:16:04,380
My aim was not, was not it for Mantis.

4265
03:16:05,580 --> 03:16:06,600
Oh my god.

4266
03:16:06,680 --> 03:16:09,520
Oh my god, that was such a bad Mantis game for me.

4267
03:16:09,860 --> 03:16:13,400
That was actually Alright, I'm pulling up the vods.

4268
03:16:13,660 --> 03:16:15,200
I'm pulling it up.

4269
03:16:15,260 --> 03:16:15,680
I see.

4270
03:16:18,540 --> 03:16:19,200
Oh my god.

4271
03:16:19,200 --> 03:16:20,200
Alright, look at this shit.

4272
03:16:20,740 --> 03:16:21,560
Look at this.

4273
03:16:22,120 --> 03:16:22,640
Woah!

4274
03:16:23,060 --> 03:16:24,120
Alright, look at this guys.

4275
03:16:24,220 --> 03:16:24,880
Watch this.

4276
03:16:25,320 --> 03:16:25,740
Woah!

4277
03:16:26,440 --> 03:16:29,240
Okay, not this yet, but Oh shit, look at that!

4278
03:16:29,600 --> 03:16:31,480
And then, oh my god.

4279
03:16:31,580 --> 03:16:32,260
Oh ho ho!

4280
03:16:32,660 --> 03:16:34,860
And then Watch this guys.

4281
03:16:35,320 --> 03:16:35,840
Boom!

4282
03:16:36,860 --> 03:16:37,940
And then he's dead.

4283
03:16:38,180 --> 03:16:40,080
But this part is my favorite part.

4284
03:16:40,720 --> 03:16:42,360
This is my favorite part of this.

4285
03:16:42,360 --> 03:16:44,160
Oh my god.

4286
03:16:45,140 --> 03:16:46,260
I told you!

4287
03:16:46,840 --> 03:16:47,860
I told you!

4288
03:16:48,040 --> 03:16:49,440
I brought receipts out.

4289
03:16:49,860 --> 03:16:52,300
I'm pulling out the receipts.

4290
03:16:52,900 --> 03:16:53,720
Told you.

4291
03:16:53,820 --> 03:16:54,880
When I'm not tired.

4292
03:16:55,580 --> 03:17:02,500
When I'm not like, when I'm not tired I admit, fuck you, we won that game.

4293
03:17:06,280 --> 03:17:07,640
Lucky shot.

4294
03:17:08,120 --> 03:17:09,540
Look, I cooked that game.

4295
03:17:09,760 --> 03:17:10,520
Exhibit A.

4296
03:17:10,520 --> 03:17:12,700
Guys, I'm tired right now.

4297
03:17:12,820 --> 03:17:14,500
My aim is not it for Mantis.

4298
03:17:14,860 --> 03:17:24,880
Cause like, Mantis's speed like, projectile is so different cause Luna's hitscan, Mantis's projectile, and my brain has not swapped over projectile today.

4299
03:17:25,000 --> 03:17:26,200
I'm too tired for that.

4300
03:17:26,680 --> 03:17:29,820
Like, my brain has not swapped yet.

4301
03:17:32,460 --> 03:17:32,760
So...

4302
03:17:33,060 --> 03:17:37,320
I kept the receipts just in case people judge me for my Mantis gameplay.

4303
03:17:37,720 --> 03:17:39,060
I keep receipts.

4304
03:17:44,420 --> 03:17:46,780
Everything will be okay.

4305
03:17:47,720 --> 03:17:48,960
Oh shit!

4306
03:17:49,540 --> 03:17:49,940
Wait.

4307
03:17:51,540 --> 03:17:53,820
Wait, but he's one above all.

4308
03:17:54,080 --> 03:17:54,780
You know what?

4309
03:17:55,140 --> 03:17:56,700
Get in my friends list.

4310
03:18:01,620 --> 03:18:04,720
I'll collect you all like the collector.

4311
03:18:06,660 --> 03:18:07,900
Yeah, that's the Widow.

4312
03:18:08,320 --> 03:18:09,420
That's the lucky Widow.

4313
03:18:10,560 --> 03:18:12,260
You know like the collector in Marvel Rivals?

4314
03:18:12,480 --> 03:18:13,140
Get in here.

4315
03:18:17,200 --> 03:18:17,920
Quick receipt.

4316
03:18:18,180 --> 03:18:20,320
Yeah, I think the games might take a bit to get in anyway.

4317
03:18:20,680 --> 03:18:22,260
So, I'll be fine.

4318
03:18:23,760 --> 03:18:24,680
It'll be fine.

4319
03:18:26,360 --> 03:18:27,280
Is Mendo still Diamond?

4320
03:18:27,720 --> 03:18:28,480
I don't know.

4321
03:18:28,700 --> 03:18:29,540
Yes, he is.

4322
03:18:31,440 --> 03:18:32,680
Yes, he is.

4323
03:18:32,680 --> 03:18:33,580
Poor guy.

4324
03:18:34,460 --> 03:18:36,580
Collecting the Infinity Stones.

4325
03:18:41,440 --> 03:18:43,400
That's rough buddy though.

4326
03:18:43,680 --> 03:18:44,360
That's rough.

4327
03:18:44,500 --> 03:18:46,680
GM1 to Diamond 1 sounds like...

4328
03:18:47,380 --> 03:18:51,960
That's like when you even get down to GM3, you'd stop by then.

4329
03:18:52,200 --> 03:18:52,900
I feel like.

4330
03:18:53,560 --> 03:18:54,580
Like, that's just...

4331
03:18:54,580 --> 03:18:55,360
Oh my god.

4332
03:18:55,420 --> 03:19:00,680
I'm just thinking like how much money did like the Wind Traders made from that to be like...

4333
03:19:01,380 --> 03:19:06,000
The fact that people like accepted the friend request to like...

4334
03:19:06,480 --> 03:19:10,080
They must have been like a lot of them were just queuing around that time.

4335
03:19:10,260 --> 03:19:11,080
That's crazy.

4336
03:19:11,600 --> 03:19:12,780
That's actually crazy.

4337
03:19:14,700 --> 03:19:16,200
Like how much money...

4338
03:19:16,200 --> 03:19:18,500
How much money would you get paid for it too?

4339
03:19:19,420 --> 03:19:21,300
I would never derank from GM because I'd stop.

4340
03:19:21,560 --> 03:19:24,020
If I have too much of a derank, I'd stop.

4341
03:19:24,340 --> 03:19:26,380
If I know it's like impossible to get it back.

4342
03:19:27,640 --> 03:19:28,000
Yeah.

4343
03:19:28,000 --> 03:19:31,120
I'm just curious how much money they made just from doing that.

4344
03:19:32,440 --> 03:19:34,180
So PB, thank you for the 100 bitties.

4345
03:19:34,240 --> 03:19:35,040
Thank you, thank you.

4346
03:19:37,100 --> 03:19:42,600
After watching YouTube and your gameplay, all hail the somehow surviving unicorn.

4347
03:19:43,220 --> 03:19:44,020
What does that mean?

4348
03:19:44,120 --> 03:19:45,040
Also, thank you for the super chat.

4349
03:19:45,160 --> 03:19:45,980
Thank you, thank you.

4350
03:19:49,280 --> 03:19:49,700
Alright.

4351
03:19:50,800 --> 03:19:51,540
Next game.

4352
03:19:53,060 --> 03:19:53,940
My favorite skin?

4353
03:19:54,620 --> 03:20:00,960
I actually really like the skins for Marvel Rivals but like not enough to pay for any yet.

4354
03:20:01,020 --> 03:20:04,160
Because like uh...

4355
03:20:05,440 --> 03:20:06,940
Oh yeah, 100 bitties.

4356
03:20:07,160 --> 03:20:07,280
Sorry.

4357
03:20:07,720 --> 03:20:08,840
Oh my god!

4358
03:20:09,240 --> 03:20:11,920
Timmy, thank you for the... Holy shit!

4359
03:20:12,000 --> 03:20:13,560
Thank you for the raid, Timmy.

4360
03:20:14,340 --> 03:20:15,580
Thank you for the raid.

4361
03:20:15,920 --> 03:20:17,420
Oh my... Hello, everybody.

4362
03:20:18,180 --> 03:20:20,020
I did not expect to see that.

4363
03:20:21,680 --> 03:20:23,500
Can we ban Hulk and then Hawkeye?

4364
03:20:23,500 --> 03:20:25,380
Or Hela if they don't already ban her?

4365
03:20:25,980 --> 03:20:25,980
Alright.

4366
03:20:26,500 --> 03:20:27,440
I'm buying Hawkeye.

4367
03:20:27,480 --> 03:20:29,660
I don't care what my duo says.

4368
03:20:32,800 --> 03:20:33,240
Hello!

4369
03:20:34,020 --> 03:20:35,120
My name is DokiBird.

4370
03:20:35,200 --> 03:20:39,220
I usually stream on YouTube, but I'm doing my Marvel Rivals grind on Twitch.

4371
03:20:40,000 --> 03:20:41,500
Because I have no idea...

4372
03:20:42,080 --> 03:20:47,420
I have no idea like when I'll get to like Eternity, but today's the day.

4373
03:20:47,500 --> 03:20:48,400
I'm gonna try and get it.

4374
03:20:48,480 --> 03:20:49,040
Today's the day.

4375
03:20:49,140 --> 03:20:49,560
I've been...

4376
03:20:49,560 --> 03:20:53,180
I've been stuck in GM for like a week now.

4377
03:20:53,480 --> 03:20:54,840
But today's the day.

4378
03:20:55,500 --> 03:20:57,100
It's gonna be that day.

4379
03:20:57,780 --> 03:21:01,020
If not, then I guess I guess I install.

4380
03:21:08,560 --> 03:21:09,980
Oh my god.

4381
03:21:10,160 --> 03:21:11,660
But we're gonna make it.

4382
03:21:13,900 --> 03:21:14,820
I'm feeling lucky.

4383
03:21:15,040 --> 03:21:16,340
I gotta say I'm feeling lucky.

4384
03:21:16,460 --> 03:21:19,540
I banned curses in my chat, so no one can curse me this time.

4385
03:21:21,300 --> 03:21:23,160
I'm gonna take 6 hours.

4386
03:21:23,680 --> 03:21:24,840
6 hours?

4387
03:21:24,980 --> 03:21:28,900
You think 6 hours is baby hours?

4388
03:21:29,080 --> 03:21:32,220
I've been playing for like 9 plus hours already.

4389
03:21:32,700 --> 03:21:35,580
You think I care about 6 hours?

4390
03:21:40,400 --> 03:21:45,980
Yesterday I grinded like 15 plus hours.

4391
03:21:46,120 --> 03:21:47,460
You think I care?

4392
03:21:51,300 --> 03:21:51,420
Alright.

4393
03:21:53,320 --> 03:21:55,240
Guys, I swear to god.

4394
03:21:55,300 --> 03:21:58,580
The moment I get to the top 500 leaderboards, it's over.

4395
03:21:59,300 --> 03:22:00,700
I'll be back to normal.

4396
03:22:00,840 --> 03:22:02,040
I'm not normal right now.

4397
03:22:02,300 --> 03:22:03,280
Like, I'm very addicted.

4398
03:22:04,100 --> 03:22:06,400
I'm so fucking addicted right now.

4399
03:22:08,920 --> 03:22:14,180
Oh yeah, I play... I flex all supports but Rocky Raccoon cause why the fuck?

4400
03:22:14,840 --> 03:22:15,660
Oh my god.

4401
03:22:15,700 --> 03:22:16,920
Wait, we didn't ban Mantis!

4402
03:22:17,180 --> 03:22:17,880
Oh my god.

4403
03:22:18,000 --> 03:22:18,520
Okay.

4404
03:22:19,680 --> 03:22:20,320
Alright.

4405
03:22:21,180 --> 03:22:21,660
It'll be fine.

4406
03:22:22,380 --> 03:22:24,820
Mantis is not banned, but it's fine.

4407
03:22:26,360 --> 03:22:28,120
Oh, is this an Eternity game?

4408
03:22:29,440 --> 03:22:30,080
Alright.

4409
03:22:30,420 --> 03:22:31,080
That's fine.

4410
03:22:33,460 --> 03:22:34,520
It's fine.

4411
03:22:36,300 --> 03:22:39,020
He says that and he's on Rocky Raccoon.

4412
03:22:39,140 --> 03:22:40,160
Please fucking...

4413
03:22:40,160 --> 03:22:43,080
Oh, thank god they're also on Rocky Raccoon.

4414
03:22:43,200 --> 03:22:46,340
Thank god we have both teams that wanna fucking lose.

4415
03:22:47,360 --> 03:22:47,840
Like...

4416
03:22:47,840 --> 03:22:49,420
Thank god.

4417
03:22:51,520 --> 03:22:52,480
Jesus Christ.

4418
03:22:53,160 --> 03:22:54,560
That makes me happy.

4419
03:22:55,340 --> 03:22:56,180
Both teams...

4420
03:22:56,180 --> 03:22:56,700
Oh, sorry.

4421
03:22:56,760 --> 03:22:58,020
I broke my Punisher's walls.

4422
03:22:58,140 --> 03:22:58,820
I'm already throwing.

4423
03:22:59,480 --> 03:22:59,860
That's okay.

4424
03:22:59,860 --> 03:23:00,560
They don't know that.

4425
03:23:01,160 --> 03:23:02,280
I didn't even watch the bot.

4426
03:23:05,160 --> 03:23:05,640
Alright.

4427
03:23:09,420 --> 03:23:10,440
Oh, he got pulled too.

4428
03:23:10,620 --> 03:23:12,100
Oh, they have... Oh!

4429
03:23:12,900 --> 03:23:13,860
Just more damage.

4430
03:23:14,660 --> 03:23:16,020
Can I pull that penny in?

4431
03:23:16,940 --> 03:23:18,780
No, do not pull the penny in!

4432
03:23:18,900 --> 03:23:19,840
Do not... Oh!

4433
03:23:20,080 --> 03:23:20,800
Fuck it!

4434
03:23:22,000 --> 03:23:23,960
They should not have pulled the penny in.

4435
03:23:25,580 --> 03:23:27,740
Oh my god, I couldn't freeze that.

4436
03:23:28,160 --> 03:23:29,580
I got fucking hit.

4437
03:23:31,820 --> 03:23:33,380
Support for Ragnarok.

4438
03:23:34,280 --> 03:23:36,840
If we had a Mantis, things would be so much easier.

4439
03:23:38,880 --> 03:23:39,400
Wait...

4440
03:23:41,540 --> 03:23:44,720
There's no reason to not play Mantis.

4441
03:23:45,880 --> 03:23:50,000
Except this is like 3.45am so people...

4442
03:23:52,580 --> 03:23:54,720
He doesn't really wanna win that badly.

4443
03:23:54,920 --> 03:23:56,820
He's literally on Rocky Raccoon.

4444
03:24:00,400 --> 03:24:02,040
Oh, I'm not ulting for that.

4445
03:24:02,200 --> 03:24:03,000
Fucking my ult doesn't...

4446
03:24:03,500 --> 03:24:06,260
My ult doesn't even save you from that.

4447
03:24:07,560 --> 03:24:08,080
Like...

4448
03:24:08,080 --> 03:24:12,680
The reason why I didn't ult that is because it doesn't matter.

4449
03:24:12,800 --> 03:24:14,620
My ult literally doesn't save you.

4450
03:24:18,600 --> 03:24:19,800
Wait, this is winnable!

4451
03:24:20,560 --> 03:24:21,640
This is so winnable!

4452
03:24:24,080 --> 03:24:25,320
This is so winnable!

4453
03:24:26,900 --> 03:24:28,240
Okay, let's...

4454
03:24:28,240 --> 03:24:29,280
Now we dance.

4455
03:24:29,740 --> 03:24:30,780
This is so winnable.

4456
03:24:31,020 --> 03:24:32,360
Oh my... Oh fuck, okay.

4457
03:24:32,460 --> 03:24:32,980
Where is he?

4458
03:24:34,100 --> 03:24:34,580
Wait...

4459
03:24:34,580 --> 03:24:35,520
This is so winnable.

4460
03:24:35,740 --> 03:24:38,480
Rocket, why did you run away from the ult that would save you?

4461
03:24:39,180 --> 03:24:47,240
The one ult that would save you.

4462
03:24:48,480 --> 03:24:51,200
Oh my god, why does everybody run away?

4463
03:24:53,680 --> 03:24:54,700
I don't understand.

4464
03:24:55,720 --> 03:24:56,160
Is it?

4465
03:24:57,780 --> 03:24:58,660
Is it though?

4466
03:24:58,660 --> 03:24:59,640
Can't break that now.

4467
03:25:00,680 --> 03:25:02,640
I need to reload my hands.

4468
03:25:06,780 --> 03:25:08,680
Nope, this is where I died.

4469
03:25:09,320 --> 03:25:09,920
This is...

4470
03:25:09,920 --> 03:25:11,920
They're trolling, dude.

4471
03:25:12,960 --> 03:25:15,640
The score wheel is not 100%.

4472
03:25:15,640 --> 03:25:16,960
It bugs out.

4473
03:25:17,060 --> 03:25:18,180
I've had it happen since...

4474
03:25:18,180 --> 03:25:19,400
They hotfixed it somehow.

4475
03:25:19,740 --> 03:25:20,960
In a way that...

4476
03:25:20,960 --> 03:25:22,140
Oh hey, Raccoon got TKs.

4477
03:25:23,040 --> 03:25:24,560
They made it so that...

4478
03:25:24,560 --> 03:25:26,480
If someone can do exclamation point Luna...

4479
03:25:26,480 --> 03:25:28,100
They made it so that...

4480
03:25:28,100 --> 03:25:30,040
Sometimes, it'll get stuck on damage.

4481
03:25:30,460 --> 03:25:32,240
Because I've done it today in the morning.

4482
03:25:33,060 --> 03:25:34,640
In my first couple of games today.

4483
03:25:34,900 --> 03:25:39,800
And I had two games where it got stuck on damage and I lost a game because of it.

4484
03:25:40,540 --> 03:25:42,920
Because we got Groot ulted and I was doing a scroll wheel.

4485
03:25:43,220 --> 03:25:46,340
We got Groot ulted, we lived but then nobody was getting healed.

4486
03:25:48,780 --> 03:25:50,760
So the scroll wheel does not fucking work.

4487
03:25:52,480 --> 03:25:53,440
And it like... yeah.

4488
03:25:56,860 --> 03:25:58,620
Yeah, that's why I don't do scroll wheel anymore.

4489
03:26:03,220 --> 03:26:05,320
Yeah, I got flamed because I got stuck on damage.

4490
03:26:05,480 --> 03:26:06,460
Like, why the fuck are you in damage?

4491
03:26:06,560 --> 03:26:08,300
And on my screen, it was clearly on heal.

4492
03:26:08,940 --> 03:26:10,480
Like, it was on heal.

4493
03:26:11,000 --> 03:26:12,700
And they're like, the fuck you doing?

4494
03:26:12,800 --> 03:26:13,580
And I'm like, I'm sorry.

4495
03:26:13,700 --> 03:26:14,500
Please don't yell at me.

4496
03:26:14,560 --> 03:26:14,960
I'll cry.

4497
03:26:15,340 --> 03:26:17,020
I've been playing for way too long.

4498
03:26:23,000 --> 03:26:23,720
I'll cry.

4499
03:26:27,640 --> 03:26:29,460
I play Wolverine.

4500
03:26:29,500 --> 03:26:30,480
You play Wolverine?!

4501
03:26:33,500 --> 03:26:35,720
Yeah, I agree.

4502
03:26:36,820 --> 03:26:38,980
Mantis is not even hard!

4503
03:26:42,360 --> 03:26:46,610
Like, how do you struggle on fucking Mantis of all fucking characters?!

4504
03:26:57,120 --> 03:26:57,740
Okay.

4505
03:26:58,060 --> 03:26:58,680
Alright.

4506
03:27:05,360 --> 03:27:06,940
I swear- oh!

4507
03:27:07,360 --> 03:27:09,120
He was not near me.

4508
03:27:10,400 --> 03:27:11,020
Oh!

4509
03:27:11,920 --> 03:27:12,780
You're fine.

4510
03:27:12,920 --> 03:27:13,900
You're so healthy.

4511
03:27:14,720 --> 03:27:16,240
You're so healthy.

4512
03:27:17,880 --> 03:27:19,560
Oh my god, I think he has ult.

4513
03:27:19,720 --> 03:27:20,180
He has ult.

4514
03:27:20,400 --> 03:27:21,020
100%.

4515
03:27:22,760 --> 03:27:24,240
Oh, they have strange ult.

4516
03:27:26,120 --> 03:27:26,940
Oh my god!

4517
03:27:27,000 --> 03:27:27,600
My mic works!

4518
03:27:28,440 --> 03:27:30,460
We have no defensive ult for it.

4519
03:27:34,680 --> 03:27:35,640
Oh my god.

4520
03:27:39,580 --> 03:27:40,740
Why not strange?

4521
03:27:42,020 --> 03:27:47,060
I feel like- I feel like strange is- Strange!

4522
03:27:47,120 --> 03:27:49,800
Oh my god.

4523
03:27:50,380 --> 03:27:51,720
We live for one strange ult.

4524
03:27:51,720 --> 03:27:52,980
Oh, that's huge, that's huge.

4525
03:27:54,120 --> 03:27:55,100
Penny, penny, penny, one.

4526
03:28:00,140 --> 03:28:01,220
Oh yeah, that's five.

4527
03:28:03,580 --> 03:28:05,140
Wait, strange has- oh, careful.

4528
03:28:07,540 --> 03:28:09,460
Yeah, I am only 68%.

4529
03:28:15,520 --> 03:28:16,260
I'm 80%.

4530
03:28:22,360 --> 03:28:22,880
Okay.

4531
03:28:23,420 --> 03:28:24,200
That's five.

4532
03:28:25,520 --> 03:28:27,020
Left side Bucky, left side Bucky.

4533
03:28:29,380 --> 03:28:30,600
I have ult, I have ult.

4534
03:28:31,960 --> 03:28:33,000
Left side Bucky still.

4535
03:28:35,640 --> 03:28:37,660
I need heals, I need heals.

4536
03:28:37,740 --> 03:28:38,260
I'm so low.

4537
03:28:39,680 --> 03:28:40,320
I'm really low.

4538
03:28:42,100 --> 03:28:42,360
Please!

4539
03:28:44,600 --> 03:28:45,660
Oh my god!

4540
03:28:48,380 --> 03:28:49,500
Oh, I'm alive!

4541
03:28:49,500 --> 03:28:51,080
I'm so alive!

4542
03:28:54,560 --> 03:28:55,440
Oh my god.

4543
03:28:55,520 --> 03:28:56,240
I'm so scared.

4544
03:28:59,980 --> 03:29:01,460
I'm just gonna play here.

4545
03:29:01,780 --> 03:29:02,840
What's the worst that could happen?

4546
03:29:02,940 --> 03:29:04,140
I'll be too far away from my team.

4547
03:29:05,340 --> 03:29:07,520
That's behind you guys.

4548
03:29:13,620 --> 03:29:15,380
Okay, you don't live through that.

4549
03:29:19,980 --> 03:29:21,500
Oh my god.

4550
03:29:24,660 --> 03:29:25,140
Okay.

4551
03:29:26,680 --> 03:29:27,520
That's fine.

4552
03:29:28,500 --> 03:29:29,980
They don't live through that.

4553
03:29:30,200 --> 03:29:32,580
They don't live through the ult.

4554
03:29:33,080 --> 03:29:34,780
I know they don't live through it.

4555
03:29:34,880 --> 03:29:38,960
I just did it for- to see if I could bait more ults out.

4556
03:29:40,980 --> 03:29:42,260
They still have strange ult, yeah.

4557
03:29:43,600 --> 03:29:44,260
Oh yeah.

4558
03:29:47,160 --> 03:29:50,620
I just did that just because I wanted to see if I could bait more ults out.

4559
03:29:58,420 --> 03:29:59,760
Alright, that's fine.

4560
03:30:02,460 --> 03:30:03,760
I need to put this on somebody.

4561
03:30:06,780 --> 03:30:08,380
Everything is so healthy.

4562
03:30:13,720 --> 03:30:14,680
Not really.

4563
03:30:15,980 --> 03:30:16,460
Oh!

4564
03:30:17,620 --> 03:30:18,700
There's the eye!

4565
03:30:21,660 --> 03:30:22,840
Don't use anything.

4566
03:30:24,020 --> 03:30:25,080
They used three ults.

4567
03:30:28,040 --> 03:30:28,940
That's good for us.

4568
03:30:29,140 --> 03:30:31,200
Good job.

4569
03:30:32,160 --> 03:30:33,220
I should have ult soon.

4570
03:30:36,300 --> 03:30:38,280
No, he does not have his turret set up.

4571
03:30:38,280 --> 03:30:39,080
Okay, come on.

4572
03:30:39,120 --> 03:30:39,480
We're gonna TP.

4573
03:30:39,760 --> 03:30:41,160
They have defensible too.

4574
03:30:43,220 --> 03:30:43,740
Alright.

4575
03:30:46,340 --> 03:30:47,380
Let's go!

4576
03:30:48,500 --> 03:30:50,160
Alright, like right on them.

4577
03:30:50,780 --> 03:30:51,480
Right on them?

4578
03:30:51,580 --> 03:30:51,760
Okay.

4579
03:30:52,420 --> 03:30:52,840
Fuck yeah.

4580
03:30:53,160 --> 03:31:02,700
This is beautiful.

4581
03:31:02,940 --> 03:31:03,520
I love this.

4582
03:31:04,700 --> 03:31:06,580
Alright, I'm going in!

4583
03:31:08,280 --> 03:31:09,100
I'm gonna kite it.

4584
03:31:11,940 --> 03:31:13,380
Oh my god!

4585
03:31:13,580 --> 03:31:13,800
What?

4586
03:31:14,620 --> 03:31:15,680
I didn't...

4587
03:31:15,680 --> 03:31:16,820
Oh my god!

4588
03:31:17,000 --> 03:31:20,480
This is the last fight.

4589
03:31:20,680 --> 03:31:21,960
I'm gonna get psyched here.

4590
03:31:22,680 --> 03:31:24,760
Can someone touch?

4591
03:31:25,060 --> 03:31:26,000
Nah, I can't.

4592
03:31:27,960 --> 03:31:29,520
Is someone able to touch him?

4593
03:31:29,980 --> 03:31:30,660
Wolverine maybe?

4594
03:31:34,690 --> 03:31:36,270
Oh my god!

4595
03:31:36,270 --> 03:31:36,590
I didn't...

4596
03:31:40,430 --> 03:31:42,270
I didn't hear the...

4597
03:31:42,270 --> 03:31:43,650
the punish ult.

4598
03:31:46,010 --> 03:31:46,970
I froze somebody.

4599
03:31:50,850 --> 03:31:52,050
Jesus Christ.

4600
03:31:52,790 --> 03:31:53,390
Jesus.

4601
03:31:59,320 --> 03:32:00,880
I didn't hear the punish ult!

4602
03:32:01,020 --> 03:32:02,100
I would have Q'd!

4603
03:32:03,060 --> 03:32:05,440
I didn't hear the punish ult!

4604
03:32:06,080 --> 03:32:08,220
If I heard... Okay, to be fair, we'd still die.

4605
03:32:09,560 --> 03:32:10,160
Yeah!

4606
03:32:10,160 --> 03:32:10,360
Yeah!

4607
03:32:11,240 --> 03:32:12,900
I didn't hear it!

4608
03:32:14,500 --> 03:32:16,340
The sound Q didn't go off!

4609
03:32:16,420 --> 03:32:17,540
I would have Q'd the moment...

4610
03:32:17,540 --> 03:32:18,480
We would have died still.

4611
03:32:22,220 --> 03:32:23,520
We would have died still.

4612
03:32:24,000 --> 03:32:27,540
The punish ult with Raccoon ult fucking strikes everything.

4613
03:32:30,740 --> 03:32:31,220
Like...

4614
03:32:31,220 --> 03:32:33,420
Oh my god, that fucking sucked.

4615
03:32:33,560 --> 03:32:36,560
If I heard it, I would instantly Q'd.

4616
03:32:36,660 --> 03:32:37,900
But also, we would not have lived.

4617
03:32:37,900 --> 03:32:39,480
We would definitely...

4618
03:32:39,480 --> 03:32:40,920
It was...

4619
03:32:40,920 --> 03:32:42,020
Was it the turret?

4620
03:32:42,700 --> 03:32:45,220
I think it was the ult.

4621
03:32:45,920 --> 03:32:47,500
Everybody got shredded so fast.

4622
03:32:51,430 --> 03:32:53,510
Oh my god, that was fucking crazy.

4623
03:32:54,210 --> 03:32:55,350
See, Raccoon wouldn't...

4624
03:32:55,350 --> 03:32:57,530
If we had a Mantis, their Raccoon was better.

4625
03:32:57,830 --> 03:33:00,550
If we had a Mantis, we would have two defensive ults.

4626
03:33:02,150 --> 03:33:05,130
Two defensive ults that could have countered each other.

4627
03:33:05,350 --> 03:33:06,390
That could have countered everything.

4628
03:33:06,390 --> 03:33:08,390
Oh hey, Mendo got back to...

4629
03:33:09,690 --> 03:33:10,130
GM.

4630
03:33:10,630 --> 03:33:11,370
Good for him.

4631
03:33:12,570 --> 03:33:13,370
Good for him.

4632
03:33:17,470 --> 03:33:18,830
Yeah, it was way too fast.

4633
03:33:18,950 --> 03:33:20,570
Turret kills don't kill that fast.

4634
03:33:23,930 --> 03:33:25,130
Oh my god.

4635
03:33:26,150 --> 03:33:27,590
By the way, Jimin didn't hear the sound Q.

4636
03:33:27,590 --> 03:33:27,650
Mendo.

4637
03:33:37,160 --> 03:33:38,660
That's not some...

4638
03:33:38,660 --> 03:33:41,000
That's not something to brag about, Mendo.

4639
03:33:49,800 --> 03:33:52,460
I don't know why you would...

4640
03:33:52,460 --> 03:33:59,460
I don't know why you would brag about that.

4641
03:34:01,360 --> 03:34:03,680
And one game off.

4642
03:34:04,040 --> 03:34:04,520
Eternal.

4643
03:34:05,380 --> 03:34:05,820
Oh.

4644
03:34:07,620 --> 03:34:08,460
Oh.

4645
03:34:10,520 --> 03:34:11,200
Damn.

4646
03:34:12,120 --> 03:34:13,260
That's rough.

4647
03:34:13,420 --> 03:34:14,460
That's actually rough.

4648
03:34:14,940 --> 03:34:16,100
That's so rough, man.

4649
03:34:18,900 --> 03:34:19,700
Alright, Hawkeye.

4650
03:34:20,240 --> 03:34:21,100
Okay.

4651
03:34:22,580 --> 03:34:24,040
Do we get Mantis?

4652
03:34:24,160 --> 03:34:25,080
Do we have a Mantis player?

4653
03:34:26,950 --> 03:34:28,000
Do we...

4654
03:34:28,000 --> 03:34:30,700
Do we have a Mantis player?

4655
03:34:31,680 --> 03:34:33,420
Cause I can play Mantis.

4656
03:34:34,640 --> 03:34:35,440
Some... Okay.

4657
03:34:35,960 --> 03:34:37,540
No, okay, we don't.

4658
03:34:37,620 --> 03:34:38,200
That's fine.

4659
03:34:42,340 --> 03:34:43,420
That's fine.

4660
03:34:46,640 --> 03:34:47,620
That's okay.

4661
03:34:51,360 --> 03:34:53,120
I didn't... Yeah, I think they...

4662
03:34:53,120 --> 03:34:54,400
I think they thought I said Rocket.

4663
03:34:55,260 --> 03:34:55,920
That's okay.

4664
03:34:55,920 --> 03:34:56,080
That's okay.

4665
03:34:56,800 --> 03:34:58,400
That's okay if they think I said Rocket.

4666
03:35:00,780 --> 03:35:01,500
That's okay.

4667
03:35:03,520 --> 03:35:05,000
Cause like, for those of you who don't know...

4668
03:35:05,000 --> 03:35:06,700
The support meta is Luna and Mantis.

4669
03:35:07,460 --> 03:35:08,680
And Luna is banned.

4670
03:35:08,900 --> 03:35:09,540
Mantis, Adam.

4671
03:35:10,220 --> 03:35:12,800
If Mantis and Luna are banned, then it's...

4672
03:35:12,800 --> 03:35:14,600
Adam, Cloak, I believe.

4673
03:35:14,880 --> 03:35:15,980
And then it's like, whatever.

4674
03:35:16,200 --> 03:35:18,040
No, then it's a free-for-all combination.

4675
03:35:18,540 --> 03:35:19,240
You can play anything.

4676
03:35:19,440 --> 03:35:20,660
Adam's really, really fucking good.

4677
03:35:20,960 --> 03:35:21,980
People just don't know how to play him.

4678
03:35:22,700 --> 03:35:24,920
If you get a really shitty man, they just don't know how to play him.

4679
03:35:24,920 --> 03:35:26,760
Cause he's actually like, hardcore meta now.

4680
03:35:29,060 --> 03:35:30,820
No Mantis team throwing.

4681
03:35:31,120 --> 03:35:31,920
But that's okay.

4682
03:35:32,580 --> 03:35:34,220
Let's hope the other team is also throwing.

4683
03:35:37,840 --> 03:35:39,860
No, Rocket is fucking garbage.

4684
03:35:40,080 --> 03:35:41,580
Nobody bans Rocket.

4685
03:35:41,860 --> 03:35:42,540
Cause no one...

4686
03:35:42,540 --> 03:35:45,340
If you have a Rocket, then it's just GG's.

4687
03:35:48,460 --> 03:35:49,880
DoQ loves Rocket Punisher?

4688
03:35:50,160 --> 03:35:52,920
The thing is, a lot of fucking...

4689
03:35:53,480 --> 03:35:54,840
A lot of team...

4690
03:35:54,840 --> 03:35:57,180
A lot of duos are fucking terrible at Rocket though.

4691
03:35:58,980 --> 03:36:00,760
Oh, I'm fucking going back then.

4692
03:36:00,860 --> 03:36:01,660
We already lost somebody.

4693
03:36:04,300 --> 03:36:05,680
Alright, guess I'm going back in.

4694
03:36:08,800 --> 03:36:10,060
I dropped down.

4695
03:36:10,220 --> 03:36:10,660
Accidentally.

4696
03:36:13,140 --> 03:36:14,600
I didn't know there was a hole!

4697
03:36:15,300 --> 03:36:17,620
I didn't know there was a fucking hole down there!

4698
03:36:18,180 --> 03:36:20,020
Dude, I didn't know like, where I was.

4699
03:36:21,160 --> 03:36:23,220
I don't like this spot.

4700
03:36:23,680 --> 03:36:24,260
At all.

4701
03:36:26,080 --> 03:36:27,520
I really...

4702
03:36:27,520 --> 03:36:28,680
Why are we still here?

4703
03:36:29,340 --> 03:36:31,980
Like, why are we...

4704
03:36:31,980 --> 03:36:33,440
Why are we still here?

4705
03:36:34,140 --> 03:36:37,360
Honestly, why are we still here?!

4706
03:36:37,800 --> 03:36:40,140
Let us go!

4707
03:36:41,520 --> 03:36:44,020
I didn't know where we TP'd!

4708
03:36:44,540 --> 03:36:46,660
I'm like, why are we still here?

4709
03:36:46,660 --> 03:36:48,720
In the backline!

4710
03:36:49,800 --> 03:36:52,120
I should've stopped healing, but I wanted my ult.

4711
03:36:53,520 --> 03:36:55,320
There's no reason to play down there.

4712
03:36:56,380 --> 03:36:57,780
Play back there.

4713
03:36:58,440 --> 03:37:02,300
Unless our team got picks while we were behind them, but I don't think our team did.

4714
03:37:04,020 --> 03:37:06,720
I don't think our team did get picks while we were behind.

4715
03:37:09,760 --> 03:37:10,280
Alright.

4716
03:37:11,600 --> 03:37:12,120
Infinite?

4717
03:37:12,800 --> 03:37:13,440
There you go.

4718
03:37:17,160 --> 03:37:17,720
Alright.

4719
03:37:20,560 --> 03:37:22,140
You don't live these.

4720
03:37:22,460 --> 03:37:24,900
You don't live these, so just hope that you kill them.

4721
03:37:25,500 --> 03:37:27,100
You don't live these.

4722
03:37:31,350 --> 03:37:33,050
We don't live these either.

4723
03:37:33,670 --> 03:37:35,550
Oh, thank god!

4724
03:37:35,690 --> 03:37:37,570
The enemy team also doesn't wanna win.

4725
03:37:37,810 --> 03:37:38,750
Oh, thank god.

4726
03:37:39,630 --> 03:37:40,510
Could we play Mantis?

4727
03:37:41,750 --> 03:37:42,030
Luna?

4728
03:37:45,490 --> 03:37:48,090
Now I'm on my knees.

4729
03:37:49,530 --> 03:37:52,650
Literally, we can win this if we have Mantis.

4730
03:37:55,570 --> 03:37:56,150
Oh, yeah.

4731
03:37:56,210 --> 03:37:57,290
We would have two defensible.

4732
03:37:58,130 --> 03:37:59,270
Oh, both teams are...

4733
03:37:59,270 --> 03:38:00,790
Okay, let's go.

4734
03:38:01,130 --> 03:38:01,730
Let's go.

4735
03:38:01,830 --> 03:38:02,970
Let's swap it up, buddy.

4736
03:38:03,330 --> 03:38:04,450
Let's swap it up.

4737
03:38:04,510 --> 03:38:06,010
I don't know why you can't play Mantis.

4738
03:38:06,170 --> 03:38:07,930
It's literally...

4739
03:38:07,930 --> 03:38:09,290
Right click and E.

4740
03:38:10,250 --> 03:38:11,470
Right click and E.

4741
03:38:12,070 --> 03:38:13,430
That's all you gotta do.

4742
03:38:13,430 --> 03:38:15,770
Now we have two defensible.

4743
03:38:15,950 --> 03:38:16,310
Let's go.

4744
03:38:17,570 --> 03:38:18,950
Right click and E.

4745
03:38:19,270 --> 03:38:20,550
It's that simple.

4746
03:38:21,750 --> 03:38:24,170
It's actually that simple.

4747
03:38:27,490 --> 03:38:29,270
Right click and E.

4748
03:38:30,150 --> 03:38:31,110
Right click.

4749
03:38:31,450 --> 03:38:32,190
Right click.

4750
03:38:32,850 --> 03:38:33,290
E.

4751
03:38:35,050 --> 03:38:36,150
There we go.

4752
03:38:36,530 --> 03:38:36,830
Sleep!

4753
03:38:37,730 --> 03:38:39,570
Okay, I don't know why the sleep didn't get it.

4754
03:38:39,850 --> 03:38:40,310
Okay.

4755
03:38:41,190 --> 03:38:43,790
I don't know why the sleep didn't go in there.

4756
03:38:49,030 --> 03:38:49,470
Sorry.

4757
03:38:50,390 --> 03:38:52,170
We just died, I guess, buddy.

4758
03:38:53,050 --> 03:38:54,550
We're just gonna have to die here.

4759
03:38:55,190 --> 03:38:55,590
Let's go.

4760
03:38:56,070 --> 03:38:56,670
E is I.

4761
03:39:02,210 --> 03:39:03,090
That's fine.

4762
03:39:04,150 --> 03:39:05,190
What are they looking at?

4763
03:39:05,230 --> 03:39:05,810
Are we portaling?

4764
03:39:06,770 --> 03:39:08,890
Or did we just look at each other like that?

4765
03:39:10,370 --> 03:39:11,930
Guys, how am I throwing?

4766
03:39:12,490 --> 03:39:15,910
I am just doing what I can in this scenario.

4767
03:39:20,430 --> 03:39:23,310
I am in a world where...

4768
03:39:26,670 --> 03:39:27,250
Alright.

4769
03:39:29,070 --> 03:39:32,810
Like, I wanna ult, but like, I don't know.

4770
03:39:33,130 --> 03:39:33,850
I have to.

4771
03:39:34,050 --> 03:39:34,570
He's gonna die.

4772
03:39:34,790 --> 03:39:36,170
Oh my god, okay!

4773
03:39:37,050 --> 03:39:40,430
He threw because you always mantis ult first.

4774
03:39:40,430 --> 03:39:41,630
It's always mantis ult first.

4775
03:39:41,710 --> 03:39:42,230
It doesn't matter.

4776
03:39:43,310 --> 03:39:44,810
It's always mantis ult first.

4777
03:39:44,930 --> 03:39:50,440
Oh my god, that sucks.

4778
03:39:51,780 --> 03:39:52,260
Literally...

4779
03:39:54,380 --> 03:39:57,620
Literally, you mantis ult first, and then you Luna.

4780
03:39:58,280 --> 03:39:59,620
It's always like that.

4781
03:40:01,120 --> 03:40:02,180
I didn't think, like...

4782
03:40:02,180 --> 03:40:03,520
I didn't think he would do it.

4783
03:40:09,060 --> 03:40:12,820
I have to write mantis ult first, then Luna.

4784
03:40:17,080 --> 03:40:18,800
No, I still have one more.

4785
03:40:19,700 --> 03:40:20,640
I still have one more.

4786
03:40:23,580 --> 03:40:24,720
I don't feel so good.

4787
03:40:27,840 --> 03:40:28,440
Yeah.

4788
03:40:36,500 --> 03:40:39,800
I asked in the beginning, and then they ignored.

4789
03:40:43,600 --> 03:40:46,260
I would've played mantis if they wanted to.

4790
03:40:48,700 --> 03:40:49,700
It's fine.

4791
03:40:54,220 --> 03:40:57,780
I feel like rocket players are always around at this time.

4792
03:40:58,340 --> 03:41:00,420
This is the only clown hours where they survive.

4793
03:41:00,540 --> 03:41:01,020
I don't know.

4794
03:41:01,620 --> 03:41:05,720
I feel like these hours are the only times they actually...

4795
03:41:06,600 --> 03:41:07,180
What?

4796
03:41:07,320 --> 03:41:08,880
I don't know why you...

4797
03:41:08,880 --> 03:41:11,220
I didn't know you...

4798
03:41:11,220 --> 03:41:12,880
I didn't know...

4799
03:41:13,600 --> 03:41:13,940
What?

4800
03:41:19,210 --> 03:41:21,570
There was no reason to...

4801
03:41:21,570 --> 03:41:26,910
What do you mean, waited so long?

4802
03:41:27,090 --> 03:41:28,610
They had every ult.

4803
03:41:28,730 --> 03:41:30,070
I had to use mantis ult.

4804
03:41:30,450 --> 03:41:31,870
Our team was okay.

4805
03:41:33,130 --> 03:41:35,530
Our team didn't need mantis ult yet.

4806
03:41:39,690 --> 03:41:40,130
What?

4807
03:41:40,130 --> 03:41:41,810
I wasn't gonna fucking pop it whenever.

4808
03:41:46,650 --> 03:41:48,330
What the fuck did he mean?

4809
03:41:48,390 --> 03:41:49,970
I didn't know you were gonna use it.

4810
03:41:54,330 --> 03:41:55,230
Oh my god.

4811
03:41:55,390 --> 03:41:57,170
Oh my god.

4812
03:41:57,230 --> 03:42:03,070
Oh my god, our team is fucked.

4813
03:42:03,250 --> 03:42:04,390
Oh, there he goes.

4814
03:42:04,390 --> 03:42:05,630
What?

4815
03:42:05,950 --> 03:42:06,890
Where's our tank?

4816
03:42:14,240 --> 03:42:16,580
Where did our tank go?

4817
03:42:21,360 --> 03:42:22,720
Oh my god.

4818
03:42:23,800 --> 03:42:25,780
I feel like I got gaslighted there.

4819
03:42:26,720 --> 03:42:29,300
I feel like I got GGs, I guess.

4820
03:42:30,500 --> 03:42:31,140
GGs?

4821
03:42:31,720 --> 03:42:34,140
What was I supposed to do in that situation?

4822
03:42:38,540 --> 03:42:40,200
I mean, I don't know.

4823
03:42:40,620 --> 03:42:43,300
Our team was a little special there.

4824
03:42:44,280 --> 03:42:45,720
It really was.

4825
03:42:46,380 --> 03:42:47,400
We could four stack.

4826
03:42:48,140 --> 03:42:49,840
No, but I would lose so...

4827
03:42:49,840 --> 03:42:51,620
I don't know if he's winning.

4828
03:42:58,960 --> 03:43:01,000
I don't know.

4829
03:43:02,900 --> 03:43:06,840
My Luna said why I didn't ult faster.

4830
03:43:07,080 --> 03:43:13,060
Why I didn't ult faster when our team was full HP.

4831
03:43:13,940 --> 03:43:17,700
And I knew you guys had all the aggression.

4832
03:43:23,920 --> 03:43:25,760
So they double

4833
03:43:28,940 --> 03:43:36,840
Your Luna was a rocket player and he should ask for permission to speak first of all.

4834
03:43:37,360 --> 03:43:39,420
Jesus Christ.

4835
03:43:39,420 --> 03:43:41,060
Do you want a four stack?

4836
03:43:43,080 --> 03:43:44,340
Chat is asking.

4837
03:43:50,980 --> 03:43:51,460
Okay.

4838
03:43:51,860 --> 03:43:54,120
I don't know how good this... I don't know who he's playing with.

4839
03:43:54,220 --> 03:43:54,620
Honestly.

4840
03:43:55,780 --> 03:43:57,260
Oh wait, he's five stack.

4841
03:43:57,420 --> 03:43:58,580
Oh, chat is asking.

4842
03:43:58,820 --> 03:44:00,220
Never mind, you're a three...

4843
03:44:00,220 --> 03:44:02,040
He's a three stack!

4844
03:44:02,040 --> 03:44:03,140
What the fuck?

4845
03:44:03,540 --> 03:44:05,200
Okay, wait.

4846
03:44:06,840 --> 03:44:09,600
You're a four stack already?

4847
03:44:10,420 --> 03:44:12,560
I was with someone.

4848
03:44:15,580 --> 03:44:17,300
I can't ditch him.

4849
03:44:21,120 --> 03:44:23,720
I can't ditch Ruben.

4850
03:44:24,240 --> 03:44:25,460
Oh my god.

4851
03:44:25,940 --> 03:44:29,060
I just invited Mace to boost me.

4852
03:44:32,600 --> 03:44:34,320
Oh my god.

4853
03:44:34,640 --> 03:44:35,460
Wait.

4854
03:44:35,760 --> 03:44:37,440
Oh, I'm still Ruben.

4855
03:44:38,900 --> 03:44:40,820
I got kidnapped.

4856
03:44:53,650 --> 03:44:56,330
Oh my god.

4857
03:44:57,170 --> 03:44:59,510
I don't know why he did that.

4858
03:44:59,510 --> 03:45:00,290
I...

4859
03:45:03,240 --> 03:45:05,470
I got kidnapped by Mende.

4860
03:45:06,370 --> 03:45:07,190
Squad.

4861
03:45:07,690 --> 03:45:10,930
But I thought he was duo'd.

4862
03:45:11,150 --> 03:45:14,390
And I asked if he wanted a four stack.

4863
03:45:16,010 --> 03:45:18,510
But he was already three.

4864
03:45:21,030 --> 03:45:23,210
Oh my god, I'm in a fucking dilemma.

4865
03:45:24,270 --> 03:45:24,970
Guys.

4866
03:45:25,790 --> 03:45:26,850
I'm in a fucking...

4867
03:45:26,850 --> 03:45:29,670
Guys, now I have too many choices.

4868
03:45:30,070 --> 03:45:30,510
Guys.

4869
03:45:31,130 --> 03:45:32,270
I have...

4870
03:45:32,270 --> 03:45:33,210
Oh my god.

4871
03:45:35,030 --> 03:45:35,870
Guys.

4872
03:45:37,510 --> 03:45:38,990
Oh my god.

4873
03:45:39,170 --> 03:45:41,270
We can't five stack too.

4874
03:45:42,430 --> 03:45:42,570
Oh.

4875
03:45:43,310 --> 03:45:44,070
What a...

4876
03:45:44,850 --> 03:45:46,950
Back to dive.

4877
03:45:47,250 --> 03:45:48,030
Bro.

4878
03:45:48,390 --> 03:45:49,890
That's fucked.

4879
03:45:50,130 --> 03:45:51,310
I don't need...

4880
03:45:51,310 --> 03:45:53,950
That's messed up, bro.

4881
03:45:53,950 --> 03:45:57,570
I'm not stealing your stack.

4882
03:45:57,810 --> 03:45:59,910
Your stack.

4883
03:46:00,490 --> 03:46:04,370
I'm not stealing his stack, man.

4884
03:46:09,950 --> 03:46:12,210
Guys, please.

4885
03:46:13,450 --> 03:46:17,050
We can figure this out.

4886
03:46:17,050 --> 03:46:17,410
But...

4887
03:46:22,090 --> 03:46:24,010
We need a six.

4888
03:46:24,230 --> 03:46:26,170
But six stacking is hard, though.

4889
03:46:27,610 --> 03:46:28,250
Okay.

4890
03:46:29,830 --> 03:46:30,470
Alright.

4891
03:46:30,750 --> 03:46:31,470
We're back.

4892
03:46:31,730 --> 03:46:32,050
Okay.

4893
03:46:35,770 --> 03:46:36,410
Alright.

4894
03:46:36,510 --> 03:46:38,210
We just gotta dodge.

4895
03:46:38,450 --> 03:46:39,850
I don't trust...

4896
03:46:39,850 --> 03:46:41,670
I don't trust Mende's team.

4897
03:46:42,370 --> 03:46:44,670
I don't know who the other two players are.

4898
03:46:45,170 --> 03:46:48,310
But I'm pretty sure those two players...

4899
03:46:49,010 --> 03:46:50,470
I have you know.

4900
03:46:52,410 --> 03:46:57,010
I ditched gamers for this.

4901
03:47:04,200 --> 03:47:05,730
And we lose another.

4902
03:47:05,910 --> 03:47:06,570
I'm sorry.

4903
03:47:14,530 --> 03:47:15,210
Alright.

4904
03:47:16,850 --> 03:47:17,490
Alright.

4905
03:47:17,490 --> 03:47:18,270
Are they...

4906
03:47:18,270 --> 03:47:18,890
Oh, they're in game.

4907
03:47:18,950 --> 03:47:20,550
Oh, their Q was faster.

4908
03:47:20,810 --> 03:47:21,110
Okay.

4909
03:47:21,290 --> 03:47:21,630
Nice.

4910
03:47:24,710 --> 03:47:25,690
I said gamers.

4911
03:47:26,410 --> 03:47:27,930
Guys, that's plural.

4912
03:47:28,510 --> 03:47:30,110
That's literally...

4913
03:47:30,110 --> 03:47:32,070
Guys, Ruben's good.

4914
03:47:32,450 --> 03:47:35,070
But that was three other gamers, guys.

4915
03:47:35,270 --> 03:47:38,570
That's three players I know that are very competent.

4916
03:47:40,170 --> 03:47:43,510
And I have to trust on four randoms.

4917
03:47:43,630 --> 03:47:45,590
I have to trust four randoms.

4918
03:47:45,610 --> 03:47:46,450
That's the thing.

4919
03:47:46,850 --> 03:47:53,230
But all... But the other one, I know three of them have like roles that I know they can play.

4920
03:47:53,610 --> 03:47:57,190
Now, I have four people who I don't know.

4921
03:48:05,070 --> 03:48:06,190
No, um...

4922
03:48:06,190 --> 03:48:12,550
Marble Rivals only let you do every stack except for five because they feel bad for the random.

4923
03:48:14,590 --> 03:48:16,330
They feel really bad.

4924
03:48:17,490 --> 03:48:18,050
Um...

4925
03:48:18,050 --> 03:48:24,290
They like... They feel bad for the one guy that has to like deal with...

4926
03:48:27,450 --> 03:48:31,330
Yeah, the sixth random might troll.

4927
03:48:31,690 --> 03:48:33,350
The sixth random will feel left out.

4928
03:48:34,510 --> 03:48:36,170
And be like, you know what?

4929
03:48:36,490 --> 03:48:37,430
Fuck you guys.

4930
03:48:46,490 --> 03:48:47,270
Yeah, guys.

4931
03:48:47,390 --> 03:48:50,210
I went with singular gamer instead of gamers.

4932
03:48:50,590 --> 03:48:52,370
Guys, I need you guys to know that.

4933
03:49:04,750 --> 03:49:07,390
Oh my god, are you fucking... Oh my god.

4934
03:49:07,390 --> 03:49:09,670
I can't not die.

4935
03:49:10,590 --> 03:49:12,690
Where are my Mantis gamers?

4936
03:49:13,610 --> 03:49:14,130
Like...

4937
03:49:17,410 --> 03:49:19,030
Oh my god.

4938
03:49:19,970 --> 03:49:22,470
Where are my fucking Mantis players?

4939
03:49:23,930 --> 03:49:28,790
Like, I know this Loki does not play anything else because he has the fucking hero thing.

4940
03:49:33,840 --> 03:49:35,240
Loki is pretty goaded.

4941
03:49:35,400 --> 03:49:37,060
Yeah, but you know what's better than Loki?

4942
03:49:37,060 --> 03:49:38,800
Mantis if she's not banned.

4943
03:49:39,520 --> 03:49:40,500
Literally, that's it.

4944
03:49:42,900 --> 03:49:47,820
And I have a Black Panther, which is like a roulette of if he's good or not.

4945
03:49:48,500 --> 03:49:51,380
It's a roulette if the enemy team can counter him or not.

4946
03:49:51,620 --> 03:49:54,140
If the fucking Luna is like...

4947
03:49:54,820 --> 03:49:57,440
the most... the goddest of all Lunas.

4948
03:49:57,640 --> 03:49:58,640
And Mantis too.

4949
03:49:58,700 --> 03:50:01,720
If the enemy team has a Mantis Luna, this Panther is not gonna be able to play.

4950
03:50:01,720 --> 03:50:02,080
Okay.

4951
03:50:05,140 --> 03:50:07,020
Guys, where the fuck are my Mantis players?

4952
03:50:07,380 --> 03:50:07,720
Honestly.

4953
03:50:09,120 --> 03:50:12,020
If anything, where are my Luna players so I can play Mantis?

4954
03:50:12,420 --> 03:50:13,180
At least.

4955
03:50:16,820 --> 03:50:18,900
You know what's better than two Luna ults?

4956
03:50:19,020 --> 03:50:20,040
A Luna and a Mantis.

4957
03:50:20,640 --> 03:50:23,200
A Mantis for the speed boost aggression.

4958
03:50:24,820 --> 03:50:25,500
That's better.

4959
03:50:27,480 --> 03:50:27,770
Okay.

4960
03:50:30,020 --> 03:50:32,460
Oh my god, the first freeze of the day.

4961
03:50:34,780 --> 03:50:35,900
Oh my...

4962
03:50:35,900 --> 03:50:37,640
Oh my god!

4963
03:50:39,140 --> 03:50:40,400
Oh my god!

4964
03:50:40,440 --> 03:50:41,560
Okay, that's fine.

4965
03:50:44,760 --> 03:50:48,460
I would love to retreat, but these guys wanna fucking play.

4966
03:50:53,700 --> 03:50:56,220
Poor Captain America died for our sins.

4967
03:51:00,000 --> 03:51:00,580
Like...

4968
03:51:04,670 --> 03:51:06,190
Alright, that's fine.

4969
03:51:11,260 --> 03:51:12,020
Oh!

4970
03:51:12,920 --> 03:51:14,780
Let's hope our...

4971
03:51:14,780 --> 03:51:16,380
Oh my god!

4972
03:51:17,220 --> 03:51:18,400
Jesus Christ!

4973
03:51:22,400 --> 03:51:24,900
Oh my god!

4974
03:51:28,240 --> 03:51:29,200
You know what?

4975
03:51:29,240 --> 03:51:30,560
I don't wanna live.

4976
03:51:30,560 --> 03:51:30,840
I...

4977
03:51:34,950 --> 03:51:35,830
Oh yeah!

4978
03:51:35,930 --> 03:51:36,750
They had Luna!

4979
03:51:37,010 --> 03:51:38,210
Of course they did.

4980
03:51:38,810 --> 03:51:41,110
Of course they had Luna and Mantis.

4981
03:51:42,690 --> 03:51:43,730
Of course.

4982
03:51:45,730 --> 03:51:46,330
Alright.

4983
03:51:48,830 --> 03:51:50,490
I didn't wanna live anyway.

4984
03:51:51,590 --> 03:51:53,530
After getting ran at by those people.

4985
03:51:54,210 --> 03:51:55,790
We got this, guys.

4986
03:51:56,110 --> 03:51:57,070
I feel so confident.

4987
03:51:58,090 --> 03:51:59,810
Okay, I feel...

4988
03:51:59,810 --> 03:52:01,750
I feel so confident.

4989
03:52:03,890 --> 03:52:08,630
Jesus Christ, they are taking so much damage.

4990
03:52:09,510 --> 03:52:10,590
I need a clap.

4991
03:52:11,650 --> 03:52:13,910
They're all in a singular line, so I'm gonna clap.

4992
03:52:14,830 --> 03:52:16,210
Oh, I wasted the clap, actually.

4993
03:52:16,730 --> 03:52:17,770
I thought they'd be closer.

4994
03:52:19,570 --> 03:52:20,070
Oh, nice!

4995
03:52:22,950 --> 03:52:25,810
Why are they not taking enough damage for me to...

4996
03:52:26,530 --> 03:52:27,090
Jesus!

4997
03:52:27,090 --> 03:52:28,170
Oh my god.

4998
03:52:29,390 --> 03:52:29,990
Nice.

4999
03:52:31,510 --> 03:52:31,990
Oh, please.

5000
03:52:32,170 --> 03:52:33,030
Please get in here.

5001
03:52:33,330 --> 03:52:33,630
Please.

5002
03:52:33,970 --> 03:52:34,690
Where's my team?

5003
03:52:35,230 --> 03:52:35,710
Where...

5004
03:52:35,710 --> 03:52:37,350
Where's my team?

5005
03:52:39,550 --> 03:52:40,690
Oh my god.

5006
03:52:41,750 --> 03:52:42,190
Oh!

5007
03:52:50,290 --> 03:52:50,890
Alright.

5008
03:52:52,370 --> 03:52:52,970
Help.

5009
03:52:53,750 --> 03:52:54,110
Okay.

5010
03:52:55,030 --> 03:52:55,550
Hey, guys.

5011
03:52:56,230 --> 03:52:57,150
Thank you.

5012
03:52:57,270 --> 03:52:57,870
Loki.

5013
03:52:58,910 --> 03:53:00,330
Oh, thank god Loki got to.

5014
03:53:00,450 --> 03:53:01,270
Oh, thank god.

5015
03:53:01,270 --> 03:53:01,990
You're useful.

5016
03:53:03,050 --> 03:53:03,930
But Liv, please.

5017
03:53:04,150 --> 03:53:05,810
Liv, you're our only healer.

5018
03:53:06,770 --> 03:53:07,770
Loki, please.

5019
03:53:08,990 --> 03:53:10,650
Loki, be alive.

5020
03:53:11,030 --> 03:53:11,710
Is he dead?

5021
03:53:11,870 --> 03:53:12,870
He's dead, guys.

5022
03:53:15,570 --> 03:53:16,090
Alright.

5023
03:53:16,910 --> 03:53:20,630
I'm not building ult fast enough because my tanks are dying so fucking fast.

5024
03:53:21,390 --> 03:53:23,110
They literally get like one shot.

5025
03:53:23,210 --> 03:53:24,070
It's actually crazy.

5026
03:53:25,050 --> 03:53:28,070
They get kidnapped and then I guess they fall?

5027
03:53:34,190 --> 03:53:35,150
Oh my god.

5028
03:53:35,190 --> 03:53:36,190
He's so low.

5029
03:53:40,710 --> 03:53:41,330
Please.

5030
03:53:41,850 --> 03:53:43,230
Don't get kidnapped.

5031
03:53:43,470 --> 03:53:44,710
I'm big of you.

5032
03:53:46,250 --> 03:53:48,010
That's all I ask for.

5033
03:53:48,230 --> 03:53:49,570
Just live.

5034
03:53:52,710 --> 03:53:54,550
Don't get kidnapped.

5035
03:53:57,170 --> 03:53:57,790
Guys.

5036
03:53:58,530 --> 03:54:02,050
I'm a little worried because nobody... Oh, there you go.

5037
03:54:07,670 --> 03:54:11,630
Can we like, you know, not let him fucking look at me like that?

5038
03:54:17,050 --> 03:54:18,290
I don't need to use it yet.

5039
03:54:18,530 --> 03:54:19,550
Okay, maybe I do.

5040
03:54:20,410 --> 03:54:21,270
No, I don't.

5041
03:54:21,370 --> 03:54:21,610
Liv.

5042
03:54:25,110 --> 03:54:26,630
This is so winnable.

5043
03:54:31,110 --> 03:54:32,750
Oh my god, maybe it's not.

5044
03:54:33,090 --> 03:54:34,170
Oh, it's so winnable.

5045
03:54:34,270 --> 03:54:35,210
Didn't have to use my ult.

5046
03:54:35,530 --> 03:54:36,130
Look at that.

5047
03:54:36,130 --> 03:54:37,610
That's called restraint.

5048
03:54:42,110 --> 03:54:43,950
That's called fucking restraint.

5049
03:54:44,730 --> 03:54:46,610
I didn't even pop my ult there.

5050
03:54:48,770 --> 03:54:50,870
I was like, no, this is totally winnable.

5051
03:54:51,230 --> 03:54:53,030
I can keep my ult.

5052
03:54:53,530 --> 03:54:53,970
Oh my god.

5053
03:54:54,330 --> 03:54:55,710
I'm not gonna jinx it.

5054
03:54:56,890 --> 03:54:58,750
I'm not gonna jinx it, guys.

5055
03:54:59,150 --> 03:55:00,270
It'll be fine.

5056
03:55:00,450 --> 03:55:01,670
It'll be so fine.

5057
03:55:02,150 --> 03:55:03,730
Everything will be fine.

5058
03:55:06,190 --> 03:55:08,130
Everything will be fine.

5059
03:55:08,510 --> 03:55:10,050
I believe.

5060
03:55:11,870 --> 03:55:12,930
It'll be okay.

5061
03:55:20,660 --> 03:55:21,930
Let me heal.

5062
03:55:22,590 --> 03:55:22,810
What?

5063
03:55:25,110 --> 03:55:27,190
What is that even?

5064
03:55:27,430 --> 03:55:27,630
What?

5065
03:55:31,370 --> 03:55:33,150
What does that even mean?

5066
03:55:34,850 --> 03:55:35,730
It's okay.

5067
03:55:39,190 --> 03:55:40,210
It's okay.

5068
03:55:41,930 --> 03:55:42,870
It's okay.

5069
03:55:43,190 --> 03:55:43,870
Oh,

5070
03:55:47,010 --> 03:55:52,490
I thought I got that freeze.

5071
03:55:52,710 --> 03:55:53,330
That's unlucky.

5072
03:55:55,470 --> 03:55:56,430
Oh, what the fuck?

5073
03:55:58,450 --> 03:55:59,690
What the fuck happened?

5074
03:56:03,110 --> 03:56:04,970
Oh my god, please!

5075
03:56:10,490 --> 03:56:11,950
What's going on?

5076
03:56:13,910 --> 03:56:15,150
Please, heal me!

5077
03:56:18,030 --> 03:56:19,430
Wait, okay, I need to watch.

5078
03:56:19,930 --> 03:56:22,870
I need to watch where the Loki Luna went.

5079
03:56:22,970 --> 03:56:23,550
Where is she?

5080
03:56:24,050 --> 03:56:25,830
Where is she?

5081
03:56:26,470 --> 03:56:27,770
Are any of you alive?

5082
03:56:28,430 --> 03:56:29,010
It's okay.

5083
03:56:32,770 --> 03:56:33,350
It's alright.

5084
03:56:34,710 --> 03:56:35,810
I'm coming in.

5085
03:56:36,390 --> 03:56:37,490
Oh, I don't need to use it yet.

5086
03:56:38,530 --> 03:56:39,970
Okay, I need to use it now.

5087
03:56:40,850 --> 03:56:42,390
Oh my god!

5088
03:56:43,990 --> 03:56:45,790
This might be where I die.

5089
03:56:46,530 --> 03:56:47,470
Nope, it's fine.

5090
03:56:49,210 --> 03:56:49,850
Okay!

5091
03:56:50,430 --> 03:56:51,850
Like, I'm sorry.

5092
03:56:52,230 --> 03:56:53,510
I can't...

5093
03:56:53,510 --> 03:56:57,990
Like, that's a lot of ults.

5094
03:56:58,090 --> 03:57:00,670
Like, I don't know what you want me to do.

5095
03:57:02,770 --> 03:57:05,930
No, they used it.

5096
03:57:06,130 --> 03:57:06,930
They used it.

5097
03:57:10,550 --> 03:57:13,110
I'm not sure about Mantis, but they used Luna.

5098
03:57:14,870 --> 03:57:16,310
I'm in a fucking building.

5099
03:57:17,610 --> 03:57:18,670
Oh my god.

5100
03:57:18,970 --> 03:57:20,330
We won that somehow.

5101
03:57:20,750 --> 03:57:21,990
Like, that's crazy.

5102
03:57:23,290 --> 03:57:24,910
We won that fucking fight.

5103
03:57:30,340 --> 03:57:31,020
Oh, shit.

5104
03:57:32,220 --> 03:57:33,220
Oh, good for you.

5105
03:57:34,520 --> 03:57:35,160
My bad.

5106
03:57:37,520 --> 03:57:40,680
Oh, she's low, she's low too.

5107
03:57:40,980 --> 03:57:41,620
She's one, she's one.

5108
03:57:46,470 --> 03:57:47,550
Cap your wallet off for a minute.

5109
03:57:49,390 --> 03:57:51,090
Oh my god, fuck it, I'll just walk around.

5110
03:57:51,750 --> 03:57:53,130
I don't care, I'm doing this shit for America.

5111
03:57:58,790 --> 03:58:01,090
Alright, that's Captain America right there.

5112
03:58:02,000 --> 03:58:03,690
That's Captain America.

5113
03:58:05,290 --> 03:58:07,310
He's gonna do this for America, guys.

5114
03:58:12,890 --> 03:58:13,830
Oh my god.

5115
03:58:15,430 --> 03:58:15,690
Oh!

5116
03:58:22,830 --> 03:58:23,430
magic's frozen.

5117
03:58:26,530 --> 03:58:29,570
Alright, yes, I ulted on point.

5118
03:58:31,010 --> 03:58:32,210
Magic's low, magic's low.

5119
03:58:33,910 --> 03:58:34,430
Alright.

5120
03:58:37,410 --> 03:58:40,310
Let's go, let's fucking, I'm leaving.

5121
03:58:46,130 --> 03:58:47,190
Oh, Grizzlow.

5122
03:58:48,810 --> 03:58:49,770
That's fine.

5123
03:58:50,430 --> 03:58:54,030
Everything is, oh my god, we're winning against Luna Mantis!

5124
03:58:54,270 --> 03:58:56,570
There is a god in this world.

5125
03:58:57,310 --> 03:58:58,570
Miracles do exist.

5126
03:59:00,670 --> 03:59:04,370
Miracles actually exist in this world, that's crazy.

5127
03:59:06,610 --> 03:59:09,210
That's actually, that's when you know god exists.

5128
03:59:15,550 --> 03:59:25,390
That's when you fucking know if you can win against a Mantis Luna, a low-key Luna, god is real.

5129
03:59:26,910 --> 03:59:28,570
Cause we just saw a miracle.

5130
03:59:30,190 --> 03:59:34,090
To be fair, we did have a Black Panther that harassed the shit out of them.

5131
03:59:35,270 --> 03:59:35,890
Hey, it's you.

5132
03:59:36,130 --> 03:59:36,630
Hey, it's him.

5133
03:59:38,830 --> 03:59:40,090
Oh my god.

5134
03:59:41,590 --> 03:59:42,170
It's him.

5135
03:59:43,370 --> 03:59:44,570
Our Black Panther is really good.

5136
03:59:44,930 --> 03:59:47,650
I was very surprised, usually Luna Mantis can shut him down.

5137
03:59:48,270 --> 03:59:50,510
And they're god low-key true.

5138
03:59:54,930 --> 03:59:57,090
Luna Mantis lost twice, why are they meta?

5139
03:59:57,450 --> 04:00:00,430
You see, there are shitty players that play Luna Mantis.

5140
04:00:00,430 --> 04:00:01,350
So...

5141
04:00:06,300 --> 04:00:08,200
So like, it's just RNG.

5142
04:00:08,660 --> 04:00:16,840
You get a person that actually knows how to play Luna Mantis the most optimal way you can, or you just get people without hands.

5143
04:00:19,380 --> 04:00:20,680
How close are we?

5144
04:00:20,740 --> 04:00:21,620
We're not close.

5145
04:00:22,200 --> 04:00:23,780
We're not fucking close at all.

5146
04:00:24,220 --> 04:00:26,900
Oh hey, what's your...

5147
04:00:27,800 --> 04:00:28,320
GM1.

5148
04:00:28,440 --> 04:00:29,900
Oh hey, who's the fuck is Gloomy?

5149
04:00:31,040 --> 04:00:32,040
Who's this guy?

5150
04:00:34,460 --> 04:00:37,240
I didn't even get you in a game, you're watching my stream.

5151
04:00:39,900 --> 04:00:43,740
You weren't even in my game, you just added me because you were watching my stream.

5152
04:00:49,660 --> 04:00:53,060
I'm just like, wait a minute, I don't recognize your name.

5153
04:00:57,590 --> 04:00:59,030
Alright, big fan.

5154
04:00:59,230 --> 04:00:59,610
True.

5155
04:01:01,910 --> 04:01:03,650
Oh hey, we got the...

5156
04:01:03,650 --> 04:01:05,170
Do we get second miracle?

5157
04:01:05,550 --> 04:01:06,530
You think that's possible?

5158
04:01:07,570 --> 04:01:09,450
What if I just... I need to ban Mantis then.

5159
04:01:10,370 --> 04:01:11,210
I wish...

5160
04:01:11,210 --> 04:01:12,490
I wish I could just ban Mantis.

5161
04:01:12,650 --> 04:01:16,990
I really don't want to play this against Hulk and...

5162
04:01:16,990 --> 04:01:18,430
Hulk and Iron Man.

5163
04:01:19,290 --> 04:01:20,170
So I usually...

5164
04:01:20,170 --> 04:01:20,170
Oh.

5165
04:01:20,690 --> 04:01:20,950
JK.

5166
04:01:22,610 --> 04:01:23,470
I forgot.

5167
04:01:23,890 --> 04:01:25,090
Confirming characters first.

5168
04:01:25,690 --> 04:01:26,250
That's awkward.

5169
04:01:27,210 --> 04:01:28,070
I'll ban Hulk first.

5170
04:01:29,950 --> 04:01:31,070
Yeah, I have the same...

5171
04:01:31,410 --> 04:01:32,550
I have the same Loki player.

5172
04:01:32,770 --> 04:01:35,910
So I'm just hoping to god the enemy team will ban Mantis.

5173
04:01:40,130 --> 04:01:41,010
We got...

5174
04:01:41,610 --> 04:01:41,830
Hawkeye.

5175
04:01:44,770 --> 04:01:45,210
No.

5176
04:01:45,630 --> 04:01:46,990
I just like, let's just gamble.

5177
04:01:47,350 --> 04:01:48,130
Oh, they ban Luna.

5178
04:01:48,390 --> 04:01:49,390
Oh, I can play Mantis then.

5179
04:01:49,510 --> 04:01:50,310
Mantis Luna works.

5180
04:01:50,750 --> 04:01:51,790
Mantis Loki works.

5181
04:01:51,890 --> 04:01:52,390
That's fine.

5182
04:01:56,400 --> 04:01:57,240
We got...

5183
04:01:57,240 --> 04:01:58,020
Okay, cool.

5184
04:01:58,020 --> 04:01:58,820
Cool.

5185
04:01:59,300 --> 04:01:59,780
Alright.

5186
04:02:02,340 --> 04:02:03,700
Mantis Loki works.

5187
04:02:08,170 --> 04:02:09,470
Maybe it will be okay.

5188
04:02:11,130 --> 04:02:11,610
Nice.

5189
04:02:16,520 --> 04:02:18,420
I'm surprised Luna Mantis hasn't been banned yet.

5190
04:02:19,460 --> 04:02:20,380
Because I like...

5191
04:02:20,380 --> 04:02:21,480
Adam's fun to play.

5192
04:02:23,120 --> 04:02:24,420
Imagine they ban Mantis Luna.

5193
04:02:24,620 --> 04:02:25,040
I don't mind.

5194
04:02:25,120 --> 04:02:29,640
I've been playing so many games where they ban Mantis Luna that it made me flex to other characters.

5195
04:02:29,640 --> 04:02:30,980
I thought Cloak was good.

5196
04:02:31,100 --> 04:02:34,380
At first people thought Cloak was good, but I think she's actually a dog shit.

5197
04:02:34,860 --> 04:02:37,660
Unless you have every fucking support ban possible.

5198
04:02:38,720 --> 04:02:39,780
Cloak is okay.

5199
04:02:40,600 --> 04:02:42,880
But Adam's just better.

5200
04:02:44,640 --> 04:02:47,760
It's like when Mantis Luna is banned and you play Cloak.

5201
04:02:48,340 --> 04:02:48,820
Cloak.

5202
04:02:49,880 --> 04:02:50,360
Adam.

5203
04:02:50,780 --> 04:02:52,220
But you should play the Adam part.

5204
04:02:52,300 --> 04:02:53,660
I have a nigger win rate on Cloak.

5205
04:02:53,940 --> 04:02:56,140
I don't even think I play her badly.

5206
04:02:56,800 --> 04:02:57,760
I just...

5207
04:02:57,760 --> 04:02:59,920
I just never have a positive...

5208
04:02:59,920 --> 04:03:02,160
I don't have a positive win rate on Cloak at all.

5209
04:03:05,960 --> 04:03:08,080
I don't think I play Cloak badly.

5210
04:03:08,460 --> 04:03:09,860
I'm just unlucky when...

5211
04:03:09,860 --> 04:03:12,880
I'm unlucky when Mantis Luna is banned and I have to play Cloak.

5212
04:03:13,120 --> 04:03:14,960
I have a positive win rate on all my other supports.

5213
04:03:20,120 --> 04:03:21,440
Like all you have to do...

5214
04:03:21,440 --> 04:03:23,680
People don't know that you can like...

5215
04:03:23,680 --> 04:03:25,620
There's so much mobility on Cloak.

5216
04:03:25,620 --> 04:03:27,620
People just don't use it.

5217
04:03:30,200 --> 04:03:31,500
Alright, here we go.

5218
04:03:32,080 --> 04:03:35,240
Here we go.

5219
04:03:36,000 --> 04:03:37,340
Oh, that's not you.

5220
04:03:37,960 --> 04:03:39,000
There we go.

5221
04:03:40,220 --> 04:03:40,840
It's this way.

5222
04:03:41,040 --> 04:03:43,300
I was getting lost.

5223
04:03:43,440 --> 04:03:43,620
Oh, okay.

5224
04:03:46,720 --> 04:03:48,500
Oh, he's so low.

5225
04:03:48,740 --> 04:03:49,920
He's so low.

5226
04:03:52,740 --> 04:03:54,020
Oh my God!

5227
04:03:54,320 --> 04:03:58,040
I will make him go to sleep!

5228
04:03:58,320 --> 04:03:59,060
Just let... Oh!

5229
04:03:59,720 --> 04:04:00,800
He did not live.

5230
04:04:01,300 --> 04:04:03,020
He did not live, but that's okay.

5231
04:04:03,040 --> 04:04:04,040
Because he didn't either.

5232
04:04:05,420 --> 04:04:06,820
Oh my God.

5233
04:04:07,200 --> 04:04:08,480
That was scary.

5234
04:04:11,500 --> 04:04:12,900
That was very scary.

5235
04:04:14,860 --> 04:04:15,580
Live.

5236
04:04:16,340 --> 04:04:16,860
Live.

5237
04:04:16,860 --> 04:04:17,720
Thank you.

5238
04:04:21,420 --> 04:04:22,820
Oh, yeah, but...

5239
04:04:22,820 --> 04:04:23,700
Oh, it's that guy, bro.

5240
04:04:23,760 --> 04:04:25,440
He's actually so good at Scarlet, though.

5241
04:04:27,800 --> 04:04:29,320
That guy is actually really good.

5242
04:04:29,840 --> 04:04:30,860
That guy was on...

5243
04:04:32,880 --> 04:04:33,320
Um...

5244
04:04:33,320 --> 04:04:33,920
Hey, headshot.

5245
04:04:39,320 --> 04:04:39,960
Oh my God.

5246
04:04:40,120 --> 04:04:40,360
Please.

5247
04:04:41,960 --> 04:04:43,260
I need to...

5248
04:04:44,660 --> 04:04:45,540
Oh my God.

5249
04:04:45,600 --> 04:04:46,340
She already got ult.

5250
04:04:46,920 --> 04:04:48,040
So do I.

5251
04:04:48,040 --> 04:04:50,140
In 20 seconds.

5252
04:04:51,820 --> 04:04:52,540
Okay.

5253
04:04:53,540 --> 04:04:54,440
Alright, let's go.

5254
04:04:56,180 --> 04:04:59,100
Let's hope we get kills out of this, then.

5255
04:04:59,940 --> 04:05:01,180
I don't... I'm scared.

5256
04:05:04,600 --> 04:05:06,500
Oh my God.

5257
04:05:08,120 --> 04:05:09,760
Oh my God.

5258
04:05:09,860 --> 04:05:11,320
We can kill him, right?

5259
04:05:11,720 --> 04:05:12,260
Nice.

5260
04:05:13,340 --> 04:05:13,860
We did.

5261
04:05:20,970 --> 04:05:21,950
Come on.

5262
04:05:22,590 --> 04:05:22,850
Damage.

5263
04:05:23,450 --> 04:05:24,090
Damage.

5264
04:05:24,790 --> 04:05:26,030
You can kill him.

5265
04:05:26,670 --> 04:05:27,690
I believe.

5266
04:05:29,750 --> 04:05:31,010
Oh, shit.

5267
04:05:33,090 --> 04:05:33,730
Alright.

5268
04:05:34,670 --> 04:05:35,570
Did I get something right?

5269
04:05:35,810 --> 04:05:36,070
Nope.

5270
04:05:36,310 --> 04:05:37,150
That's five.

5271
04:05:40,870 --> 04:05:44,050
I don't know about that, but that's...

5272
04:05:44,050 --> 04:05:44,450
Okay.

5273
04:05:45,350 --> 04:05:47,750
The rock was very scary and intimidating.

5274
04:05:47,750 --> 04:05:49,750
Help me.

5275
04:05:50,530 --> 04:05:51,150
Help me.

5276
04:05:51,430 --> 04:05:51,890
No!

5277
04:05:56,670 --> 04:05:57,550
It's fine.

5278
04:05:57,690 --> 04:05:58,830
Just stall the point.

5279
04:06:00,990 --> 04:06:02,250
Alright, I almost have ult.

5280
04:06:03,910 --> 04:06:04,670
It's fine.

5281
04:06:05,710 --> 04:06:06,930
It's fine.

5282
04:06:11,900 --> 04:06:12,520
Alright.

5283
04:06:12,900 --> 04:06:13,840
Can you kill her?

5284
04:06:15,040 --> 04:06:16,280
Alright, can you kill her?

5285
04:06:17,360 --> 04:06:18,520
Doesn't look like it.

5286
04:06:18,520 --> 04:06:20,560
Alright, can you kill her now?

5287
04:06:25,680 --> 04:06:25,960
Alright.

5288
04:06:28,340 --> 04:06:28,700
Nice.

5289
04:06:34,840 --> 04:06:36,920
That's a big one right there.

5290
04:06:41,080 --> 04:06:42,180
Oh, no.

5291
04:06:42,280 --> 04:06:43,800
The goddamn pillar.

5292
04:06:48,180 --> 04:06:49,460
Oh my God.

5293
04:06:49,520 --> 04:06:50,760
I hate aiming here.

5294
04:06:50,760 --> 04:06:51,980
This is...

5295
04:06:51,980 --> 04:06:53,060
Oh my God.

5296
04:06:55,600 --> 04:06:56,560
Okay, let's go.

5297
04:06:58,040 --> 04:06:58,920
Just, please.

5298
04:06:59,380 --> 04:07:00,260
Push forward.

5299
04:07:00,820 --> 04:07:01,140
Please.

5300
04:07:03,920 --> 04:07:05,520
I'm dropping down.

5301
04:07:06,100 --> 04:07:07,300
Oh, fuck this.

5302
04:07:07,760 --> 04:07:09,060
I don't want to play up there anymore.

5303
04:07:12,600 --> 04:07:13,320
Alright.

5304
04:07:14,140 --> 04:07:15,180
That's okay, Groot.

5305
04:07:18,890 --> 04:07:20,190
Thank God.

5306
04:07:22,610 --> 04:07:24,030
Get that Scarlet Witch.

5307
04:07:25,730 --> 04:07:26,750
There we go.

5308
04:07:27,130 --> 04:07:28,110
Thank God.

5309
04:07:30,970 --> 04:07:33,050
No, that's just...

5310
04:07:33,050 --> 04:07:34,950
That was a hate crime right there.

5311
04:07:35,010 --> 04:07:36,650
I witnessed a natural hate crime.

5312
04:07:39,630 --> 04:07:40,730
Oh, thank God.

5313
04:07:40,770 --> 04:07:42,470
I denied his again, though.

5314
04:07:42,570 --> 04:07:43,830
I really appreciate it.

5315
04:07:46,350 --> 04:07:47,550
I denied it.

5316
04:07:47,550 --> 04:07:47,570
Alright.

5317
04:07:50,610 --> 04:07:52,770
Thank God, I did not want to go again.

5318
04:07:53,570 --> 04:07:55,850
I really, really did not want to go again.

5319
04:07:57,710 --> 04:07:58,850
What time is it?

5320
04:07:58,850 --> 04:07:59,630
Oh, it's 430.

5321
04:08:00,170 --> 04:08:01,470
Oh, guys.

5322
04:08:02,210 --> 04:08:04,790
It's 430 AM, but I'm committed.

5323
04:08:05,510 --> 04:08:07,410
We're not ending stream until eternity.

5324
04:08:08,110 --> 04:08:08,970
I don't care.

5325
04:08:10,390 --> 04:08:11,670
I don't fucking care.

5326
04:08:16,410 --> 04:08:17,290
It'll be fine.

5327
04:08:17,430 --> 04:08:18,210
Everything will be fine.

5328
04:08:21,750 --> 04:08:22,690
Everything will be fine.

5329
04:08:24,150 --> 04:08:24,890
This is it.

5330
04:08:25,370 --> 04:08:27,370
And then I'll never... No, I'll still go crazy.

5331
04:08:27,470 --> 04:08:28,870
Because I want the top 500.

5332
04:08:30,390 --> 04:08:31,150
I want top 500.

5333
04:08:31,230 --> 04:08:33,390
But the quality of the games will get better in eternity, right?

5334
04:08:34,470 --> 04:08:35,650
People are so much better.

5335
04:08:38,070 --> 04:08:39,930
The quality of the games should get better.

5336
04:08:39,930 --> 04:08:40,050
Okay.

5337
04:08:40,970 --> 04:08:42,190
That's how it usually goes, right?

5338
04:08:46,230 --> 04:08:46,670
Woah.

5339
04:08:51,190 --> 04:08:52,590
Oh my God!

5340
04:08:52,670 --> 04:08:52,990
Okay.

5341
04:08:56,590 --> 04:08:57,470
I have...

5342
04:08:57,470 --> 04:08:58,290
Oh my God.

5343
04:08:58,350 --> 04:08:59,990
They have BP.

5344
04:09:01,490 --> 04:09:02,750
This is scary.

5345
04:09:02,930 --> 04:09:03,770
I'm gonna back out then.

5346
04:09:05,550 --> 04:09:06,370
Don't worry, Loki.

5347
04:09:06,430 --> 04:09:07,090
I got you.

5348
04:09:07,870 --> 04:09:09,170
And I got you too, Magneto.

5349
04:09:09,170 --> 04:09:10,810
You're fine already, but that's okay.

5350
04:09:10,810 --> 04:09:12,290
I still got you.

5351
04:09:15,250 --> 04:09:17,150
As long as Remedy is not...

5352
04:09:17,150 --> 04:09:20,150
Remedy is not on an aim hero, I'm like, okay.

5353
04:09:20,770 --> 04:09:21,630
Because Remedy...

5354
04:09:23,590 --> 04:09:25,410
Remedy is so scary on Hela.

5355
04:09:25,550 --> 04:09:30,310
I played Remedy on my team and she was on Hela.

5356
04:09:30,450 --> 04:09:32,830
She literally diffed people so hard.

5357
04:09:33,550 --> 04:09:36,790
The only reason they're like...

5358
04:09:36,790 --> 04:09:38,830
The only reason they're not on...

5359
04:09:43,090 --> 04:09:43,490
Goodbye.

5360
04:09:45,410 --> 04:09:46,290
Sorry, buddy.

5361
04:09:47,270 --> 04:09:48,670
It's because of their ping, apparently.

5362
04:09:49,010 --> 04:09:50,390
Their ping is really bad right now.

5363
04:09:51,970 --> 04:09:52,870
Where the fuck...

5364
04:09:52,870 --> 04:09:53,570
Oh, there he is.

5365
04:09:55,650 --> 04:09:56,750
I like ran away.

5366
04:09:57,090 --> 04:09:58,770
There was no way I was gonna live through that.

5367
04:10:04,920 --> 04:10:06,460
Yeah, I don't wanna deal with...

5368
04:10:06,460 --> 04:10:08,880
Oh, I need to save my... That means I have to save my...

5369
04:10:10,720 --> 04:10:12,520
I'll just save my sleep for Black Panther.

5370
04:10:14,880 --> 04:10:15,060
Here.

5371
04:10:20,720 --> 04:10:23,440
Jesus Christ, he's so fucking fast.

5372
04:10:24,700 --> 04:10:26,300
Someone lower his DPI.

5373
04:10:26,940 --> 04:10:27,840
Right now.

5374
04:10:30,120 --> 04:10:30,600
You know what?

5375
04:10:30,600 --> 04:10:32,360
I believe in your DPS, Loki.

5376
04:10:32,900 --> 04:10:33,960
I'm gonna damage boost you.

5377
04:10:36,440 --> 04:10:37,160
Nice.

5378
04:10:37,740 --> 04:10:38,980
Oh, stand down!

5379
04:10:39,840 --> 04:10:40,500
Hit me again!

5380
04:10:41,080 --> 04:10:41,840
Come on!

5381
04:10:41,840 --> 04:10:43,640
Oh, he's dead.

5382
04:10:44,820 --> 04:10:45,800
He's dead.

5383
04:10:47,360 --> 04:10:48,220
That's okay.

5384
04:10:49,780 --> 04:10:50,920
We don't need it.

5385
04:10:55,800 --> 04:10:56,780
That's fine.

5386
04:10:58,840 --> 04:10:59,380
Where is he?

5387
04:11:00,080 --> 04:11:01,060
Oh, there he is.

5388
04:11:02,100 --> 04:11:04,600
Oh my god, I just wanna know what his DPI is.

5389
04:11:04,880 --> 04:11:05,900
What is that?

5390
04:11:05,960 --> 04:11:08,100
I feel like playing Black Panther...

5391
04:11:08,100 --> 04:11:09,780
You have to like...

5392
04:11:09,780 --> 04:11:11,920
Your sensitivity must be so fucking high.

5393
04:11:11,920 --> 04:11:12,800
What are you aiming?

5394
04:11:13,400 --> 04:11:15,840
Your only aim is your spear.

5395
04:11:23,730 --> 04:11:24,450
Goodbye.

5396
04:11:26,450 --> 04:11:27,230
Are they okay?

5397
04:11:27,870 --> 04:11:28,650
Oh, they're okay.

5398
04:11:28,790 --> 04:11:29,570
They're so safe.

5399
04:11:31,030 --> 04:11:31,910
Someone up top?

5400
04:11:35,550 --> 04:11:36,990
I heard them.

5401
04:11:38,830 --> 04:11:39,870
I swear.

5402
04:11:40,450 --> 04:11:41,610
I'm not crazy.

5403
04:11:44,270 --> 04:11:46,090
I knew it!

5404
04:11:46,330 --> 04:11:46,710
I knew it!

5405
04:11:47,570 --> 04:11:49,110
I fucking knew it!

5406
04:11:57,270 --> 04:11:59,630
Oh my god.

5407
04:12:01,830 --> 04:12:03,510
That's okay.

5408
04:12:08,370 --> 04:12:09,690
Oh shit!

5409
04:12:10,770 --> 04:12:12,750
I'm alive?!

5410
04:12:14,750 --> 04:12:16,410
I don't know about him though.

5411
04:12:22,310 --> 04:12:23,370
Where is he?

5412
04:12:24,570 --> 04:12:25,690
I can't...

5413
04:12:25,690 --> 04:12:28,130
I was like, where is the fucking Mantis?

5414
04:12:31,570 --> 04:12:33,090
Oh my god.

5415
04:12:33,890 --> 04:12:34,530
It's okay.

5416
04:12:34,810 --> 04:12:35,950
Everything is fine.

5417
04:12:38,890 --> 04:12:40,030
We did it.

5418
04:12:42,890 --> 04:12:51,650
That's why when people say, I don't know how to play the Mantis, Mantis and Luna has to be the easiest fucking character you can play as support.

5419
04:12:52,210 --> 04:12:56,050
It's when you play like Adam and Adam is when things get complicated.

5420
04:12:56,510 --> 04:13:03,790
Cause like, you have to like think about like, oh they're low, but do they really need this heal?

5421
04:13:05,890 --> 04:13:06,490
Like...

5422
04:13:07,650 --> 04:13:10,050
I'd be like, oh man.

5423
04:13:10,650 --> 04:13:11,830
Do they really need this?

5424
04:13:11,890 --> 04:13:14,390
Or can my other support do the job for me?

5425
04:13:16,990 --> 04:13:19,390
It's all about, Adam is all about restraint.

5426
04:13:19,750 --> 04:13:22,490
And that's how I had to learn how to play.

5427
04:13:22,810 --> 04:13:26,890
Like, Adam is literally just restraint cause you're just like, I could heal you.

5428
04:13:27,570 --> 04:13:29,030
But like, you don't really need it.

5429
04:13:34,110 --> 04:13:36,090
No, Jeff is fucking terrible.

5430
04:13:36,490 --> 04:13:39,290
I mean, there's like a couple of Jeff one tricks that are really good.

5431
04:13:39,710 --> 04:13:43,130
But like, why play Jeff when other support combos are just better?

5432
04:13:43,130 --> 04:13:46,230
And there's like, Jeff is map dependent too.

5433
04:13:46,450 --> 04:13:51,590
Cause there's no outside there's no like outside borders for Jeff.

5434
04:13:51,830 --> 04:13:54,830
So it's like, the ult is practically useless.

5435
04:13:55,290 --> 04:13:56,570
Cause you can't kill them.

5436
04:13:57,510 --> 04:13:58,870
You can't really kill them.

5437
04:13:59,270 --> 04:14:10,670
Usually, I still have, I've learned this, but you use Jeff to like, get if you die, if it's last fight and you died, and you died early on, you use Jeff to like get back on time.

5438
04:14:10,670 --> 04:14:12,490
To like, heal the team.

5439
04:14:13,010 --> 04:14:14,670
But Jeff is so...

5440
04:14:15,730 --> 04:14:20,970
Like, if you're a one trick, obviously, one tricks are just really good in general.

5441
04:14:23,170 --> 04:14:29,030
But, it's just, you also have to be a fucking masochist to be a one trick.

5442
04:14:29,390 --> 04:14:30,790
Cause everybody fucking hates you.

5443
04:14:34,110 --> 04:14:36,550
Like, if you lose, you get shit talked.

5444
04:14:37,030 --> 04:14:41,830
And like, but they'll specifically blame you, cause you're not playing meta.

5445
04:14:41,950 --> 04:14:42,770
Just like what I did.

5446
04:14:42,890 --> 04:14:44,710
I'll be like, you fucked this Reku one trick.

5447
04:14:45,090 --> 04:14:45,250
Like,

5448
04:14:49,910 --> 04:14:53,090
yeah, I'd be a fucking masochist if you were in a one trick.

5449
04:14:53,430 --> 04:14:53,990
In general.

5450
04:14:55,490 --> 04:14:56,410
The rank 1 Wolverine?

5451
04:14:56,470 --> 04:14:57,930
The thing is, Wolverine is meta.

5452
04:14:59,510 --> 04:15:00,990
Wolverine's not bad.

5453
04:15:01,230 --> 04:15:02,730
He's literally meta.

5454
04:15:03,910 --> 04:15:08,970
Cause people actually realize, Wolverine's really fucking good in general.

5455
04:15:14,500 --> 04:15:17,020
So it's like, yeah, if you're a one trick on a...

5456
04:15:17,020 --> 04:15:21,360
The only issue is like, if you're a one trick, and you can't play any other character.

5457
04:15:23,460 --> 04:15:24,860
That's fucking terrifying.

5458
04:15:26,000 --> 04:15:27,400
That's the terrifying part.

5459
04:15:29,840 --> 04:15:32,960
Cause like, the moment you ban a one trick, they're fucking useless.

5460
04:15:34,300 --> 04:15:35,900
That's why people target ban.

5461
04:15:37,040 --> 04:15:38,180
I target ban.

5462
04:15:39,400 --> 04:15:41,240
I 100% target ban.

5463
04:15:41,280 --> 04:15:42,900
I'm fucking taking any advantage I can get.

5464
04:15:45,600 --> 04:15:51,900
If I know what you play, and I know you're useless in everything else, I would fucking...

5465
04:15:52,580 --> 04:15:53,440
Ah shit, okay.

5466
04:15:53,940 --> 04:15:54,920
I almost went Raccoon.

5467
04:15:56,400 --> 04:15:57,080
That's fine.

5468
04:15:57,300 --> 04:15:58,420
I can do Mantis.

5469
04:15:59,340 --> 04:16:01,000
I am a professional hater.

5470
04:16:01,660 --> 04:16:02,540
Oh my god.

5471
04:16:02,660 --> 04:16:04,120
No, I'm gonna hate right now.

5472
04:16:04,820 --> 04:16:05,840
I'm gonna...

5473
04:16:05,840 --> 04:16:08,600
I'm gonna fucking hate right now.

5474
04:16:09,280 --> 04:16:16,360
Yeah, but apparently if you... Yeah, but the thing about being infamous is... Oh my god, I'm gonna...

5475
04:16:19,440 --> 04:16:22,520
I'm gonna spread hate right now.

5476
04:16:24,600 --> 04:16:26,860
If you wanna play Loki, just play Adam.

5477
04:16:28,100 --> 04:16:34,260
If you want to play Mantis, we can trip sup with Adam.

5478
04:16:34,860 --> 04:16:35,220
Mantis.

5479
04:16:35,660 --> 04:16:36,320
Luna.

5480
04:16:40,220 --> 04:16:41,860
Loki works too.

5481
04:16:46,920 --> 04:16:48,060
It's fine.

5482
04:16:48,120 --> 04:16:48,840
Loki works.

5483
04:16:51,960 --> 04:16:54,900
I can get back Luna.

5484
04:16:55,620 --> 04:16:56,180
And I'll play her.

5485
04:16:58,760 --> 04:17:01,260
Alright, Loki works but Adam's better.

5486
04:17:02,780 --> 04:17:03,480
It's better.

5487
04:17:03,560 --> 04:17:05,000
Any triple support combo works.

5488
04:17:05,180 --> 04:17:08,320
It's just the most optimal is you have to have Adam in the third slot.

5489
04:17:09,240 --> 04:17:10,260
Because of the Soulbond.

5490
04:17:10,440 --> 04:17:11,520
The Soulbond makes it work.

5491
04:17:13,400 --> 04:17:15,400
It's literally like just the Soulbond.

5492
04:17:15,520 --> 04:17:17,580
What the fuck am I watching?

5493
04:17:20,060 --> 04:17:24,080
Like, I wanted to fucking set up high ground and then I see this?

5494
04:17:27,580 --> 04:17:28,060
Where?

5495
04:17:29,640 --> 04:17:30,660
Oh my!

5496
04:17:31,580 --> 04:17:32,240
Okay.

5497
04:17:34,000 --> 04:17:34,940
How the?

5498
04:17:35,280 --> 04:17:36,900
Okay, what's my team doing?

5499
04:17:37,600 --> 04:17:39,460
Everybody is so spread out.

5500
04:17:39,560 --> 04:17:41,120
Like, actually, what are they doing?

5501
04:17:42,680 --> 04:17:44,420
Like, what happened?

5502
04:17:46,260 --> 04:17:48,060
What the fuck happened, guys?

5503
04:17:48,740 --> 04:17:50,480
Like, what's going?

5504
04:17:50,900 --> 04:17:51,740
Oh my gosh.

5505
04:17:51,840 --> 04:17:55,460
It tucked Jeff and then my team got fucking distracted by a Jeff.

5506
04:17:56,060 --> 04:17:56,500
Actually.

5507
04:17:57,600 --> 04:17:59,800
But this is a Jeff map, though, if you guys want to know.

5508
04:18:00,360 --> 04:18:01,660
This is a Jeff map.

5509
04:18:03,620 --> 04:18:04,880
Like, what happened?

5510
04:18:05,400 --> 04:18:06,840
I literally turned around.

5511
04:18:10,600 --> 04:18:16,100
Like, why did I just watch my tanks build fucking Fortnite?

5512
04:18:17,540 --> 04:18:21,140
Yeah, this is one of the very rare Jeff maps where it can work.

5513
04:18:21,240 --> 04:18:23,240
But I've also beaten Jeff one tricks before.

5514
04:18:23,820 --> 04:18:26,820
Like, if we have a team, that's just better.

5515
04:18:29,720 --> 04:18:31,080
Is the Psylocke to your left?

5516
04:18:32,960 --> 04:18:33,160
Alright.

5517
04:18:33,280 --> 04:18:33,840
Psylocke on the left.

5518
04:18:34,580 --> 04:18:35,820
I just said that!

5519
04:18:36,760 --> 04:18:37,840
Fuck me, I guess.

5520
04:18:38,860 --> 04:18:39,640
You're right.

5521
04:18:40,660 --> 04:18:41,700
You're fucking right.

5522
04:18:45,360 --> 04:18:47,080
Fuck my opinions.

5523
04:18:47,160 --> 04:18:47,460
Goodbye.

5524
04:18:48,460 --> 04:18:51,180
I got hit by the pillar.

5525
04:18:51,180 --> 04:18:54,560
See, this is why it's a...

5526
04:18:54,560 --> 04:18:56,080
This is exactly why.

5527
04:18:59,380 --> 04:19:00,660
No, it's...

5528
04:19:00,660 --> 04:19:02,840
I saw myself pop up on the top left.

5529
04:19:07,540 --> 04:19:08,180
Okay.

5530
04:19:14,300 --> 04:19:14,820
Okay.

5531
04:19:14,820 --> 04:19:15,720
Can we get this?

5532
04:19:16,920 --> 04:19:17,980
Yeah, we can get this.

5533
04:19:18,340 --> 04:19:19,740
Get the shark!

5534
04:19:20,160 --> 04:19:21,580
Get the shark!

5535
04:19:22,240 --> 04:19:25,060
I'm the only one that shot!

5536
04:19:26,020 --> 04:19:28,340
I was the only one that shot.

5537
04:19:28,500 --> 04:19:30,700
That's actually crazy.

5538
04:19:31,420 --> 04:19:36,180
I was the only one that shot the shark.

5539
04:19:36,780 --> 04:19:38,060
That's... Oh my god.

5540
04:19:39,740 --> 04:19:40,160
Oh my...

5541
04:19:40,160 --> 04:19:40,820
They have rez.

5542
04:19:42,600 --> 04:19:43,440
That's chill.

5543
04:19:46,700 --> 04:19:50,720
Why did no one else touch the shark?

5544
04:19:52,320 --> 04:19:53,180
That's fine.

5545
04:19:57,570 --> 04:19:59,070
That's so fine.

5546
04:20:04,810 --> 04:20:05,490
Alright.

5547
04:20:07,390 --> 04:20:08,850
Where's my other DPS?

5548
04:20:09,050 --> 04:20:09,470
There he is.

5549
04:20:09,610 --> 04:20:10,990
Oh, where's my only DPS?

5550
04:20:11,470 --> 04:20:13,630
Alright, I'm just gonna back up.

5551
04:20:16,330 --> 04:20:17,010
Alright.

5552
04:20:18,990 --> 04:20:19,610
Here we go.

5553
04:20:22,630 --> 04:20:23,750
Oh, nice.

5554
04:20:24,250 --> 04:20:25,290
They're born again.

5555
04:20:31,350 --> 04:20:32,090
There's Psylocke here.

5556
04:20:33,610 --> 04:20:34,630
Psylocke on me.

5557
04:20:37,290 --> 04:20:38,370
I knew it!

5558
04:20:38,410 --> 04:20:39,630
I knew my mic worked!

5559
04:20:39,990 --> 04:20:41,610
He acknowledged me!

5560
04:20:46,270 --> 04:20:48,390
I fucking knew it!

5561
04:20:48,630 --> 04:20:49,630
He just...

5562
04:20:52,050 --> 04:20:54,170
I knew my mic worked.

5563
04:20:54,810 --> 04:20:56,610
I fucking knew it.

5564
04:21:02,790 --> 04:21:03,530
Oh.

5565
04:21:05,370 --> 04:21:06,630
He's asleep though.

5566
04:21:06,730 --> 04:21:07,890
Oh, he woke him up.

5567
04:21:09,090 --> 04:21:10,210
That's okay.

5568
04:21:11,130 --> 04:21:11,990
That's okay.

5569
04:21:16,370 --> 04:21:17,670
That's okay.

5570
04:21:19,090 --> 04:21:20,150
I'm all dial-up though.

5571
04:21:22,230 --> 04:21:23,810
I'll touch here.

5572
04:21:32,040 --> 04:21:33,460
I'm just gonna ult this.

5573
04:21:39,630 --> 04:21:41,450
Alright, I can die here.

5574
04:21:42,530 --> 04:21:44,310
So I can go Luna.

5575
04:21:46,350 --> 04:21:47,510
That's fine.

5576
04:21:47,850 --> 04:21:48,970
I can go Luna.

5577
04:21:49,430 --> 04:21:50,790
That's fine.

5578
04:21:51,130 --> 04:21:52,570
I'm fine with that.

5579
04:21:53,810 --> 04:21:57,570
That's a death I'm willing to take to be on Luna.

5580
04:21:59,030 --> 04:21:59,430
Alright.

5581
04:21:59,430 --> 04:21:59,750
Alright.

5582
04:22:01,030 --> 04:22:03,370
Stop cheering the Jeff on!

5583
04:22:03,550 --> 04:22:04,470
I wanna win!

5584
04:22:15,250 --> 04:22:15,930
Dead.

5585
04:22:17,230 --> 04:22:18,950
No Judge Jury for you.

5586
04:22:24,910 --> 04:22:27,150
Oh, please just heal me a little bit.

5587
04:22:27,750 --> 04:22:29,350
Please, I just... Okay, there you go.

5588
04:22:31,090 --> 04:22:32,910
Oh my god!

5589
04:22:33,770 --> 04:22:33,990
Oh.

5590
04:22:34,590 --> 04:22:35,810
Sucks to be him, I guess.

5591
04:22:37,810 --> 04:22:40,310
I need to reload my hands and I don't wanna be too close.

5592
04:22:46,540 --> 04:22:47,520
Oh, he's lit.

5593
04:22:49,660 --> 04:22:51,040
He actually... Strange has ult.

5594
04:22:56,640 --> 04:22:57,440
Jesus Christ.

5595
04:22:58,020 --> 04:22:59,480
Strange, there's a Jeff behind us.

5596
04:22:59,640 --> 04:23:00,000
That was mine.

5597
04:23:02,800 --> 04:23:03,500
Strange is low.

5598
04:23:06,640 --> 04:23:07,500
Starlord one.

5599
04:23:08,280 --> 04:23:09,540
And there's a Jeff behind us.

5600
04:23:10,520 --> 04:23:11,000
No, Strange.

5601
04:23:11,180 --> 04:23:11,560
No, Strange.

5602
04:23:13,200 --> 04:23:14,920
The Jeff is still behind us, by the way.

5603
04:23:15,280 --> 04:23:16,060
He's looking for ult.

5604
04:23:17,120 --> 04:23:17,860
He's behind.

5605
04:23:18,000 --> 04:23:18,520
He's on the cliff.

5606
04:23:19,440 --> 04:23:20,040
He's low.

5607
04:23:24,220 --> 04:23:24,780
Please!

5608
04:23:25,440 --> 04:23:27,360
Somebody kill this Jeff!

5609
04:23:29,520 --> 04:23:31,020
Oh my god!

5610
04:23:31,940 --> 04:23:33,740
It'll be there forever!

5611
04:23:33,740 --> 04:23:35,340
Jeff's just looking for an ult.

5612
04:23:36,400 --> 04:23:37,120
Jeff is low.

5613
04:23:39,540 --> 04:23:40,660
Goodbye, Thor.

5614
04:23:42,180 --> 04:23:43,260
Jeff is half.

5615
04:23:43,860 --> 04:23:44,060
Oh.

5616
04:23:48,260 --> 04:23:48,980
Morning.

5617
04:23:50,660 --> 04:23:51,740
Good morning.

5618
04:23:54,440 --> 04:23:55,160
Uh...

5619
04:23:55,160 --> 04:23:56,260
We might die low-key.

5620
04:24:01,620 --> 04:24:02,340
Uh...

5621
04:24:03,340 --> 04:24:05,600
Alright, we have Luna ult going in.

5622
04:24:06,640 --> 04:24:07,220
On point.

5623
04:24:12,000 --> 04:24:12,980
Strange is half.

5624
04:24:13,900 --> 04:24:14,520
Strange is low.

5625
04:24:15,060 --> 04:24:15,640
He can't heal.

5626
04:24:23,590 --> 04:24:24,470
Oh my god.

5627
04:24:29,110 --> 04:24:29,690
Oh!

5628
04:24:32,430 --> 04:24:33,590
This is his last fight.

5629
04:24:33,590 --> 04:24:33,670
Alright.

5630
04:24:39,370 --> 04:24:40,030
Top left!

5631
04:24:40,170 --> 04:24:40,350
Top left!

5632
04:24:47,870 --> 04:24:49,170
Who's banging that drums?

5633
04:24:57,300 --> 04:24:58,340
I froze him!

5634
04:24:59,380 --> 04:24:59,580
Oh.

5635
04:25:01,520 --> 04:25:02,540
I'm dead here, though.

5636
04:25:04,260 --> 04:25:05,460
No, no Luna heals.

5637
04:25:08,960 --> 04:25:09,880
Oh, Strange is low!

5638
04:25:09,940 --> 04:25:10,860
Strange is one!

5639
04:25:15,770 --> 04:25:17,190
Wait, Starlord's half.

5640
04:25:20,290 --> 04:25:20,950
Oh no.

5641
04:25:24,450 --> 04:25:25,230
Nice, Starlord.

5642
04:25:26,590 --> 04:25:27,250
I got...

5643
04:25:27,250 --> 04:25:27,670
Yeah, nice.

5644
04:25:28,650 --> 04:25:29,310
Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff!

5645
04:25:30,070 --> 04:25:30,810
Jeff and Starlord!

5646
04:25:31,530 --> 04:25:32,650
I might be dead, though.

5647
04:25:32,990 --> 04:25:33,410
Oh, I got it!

5648
04:25:33,970 --> 04:25:34,570
Nice.

5649
04:25:36,830 --> 04:25:38,210
Their entire team's here.

5650
04:25:40,810 --> 04:25:42,010
I'm contesting.

5651
04:25:42,010 --> 04:25:42,090
I'm contesting.

5652
04:25:45,810 --> 04:25:46,890
Oh my god!

5653
04:25:48,330 --> 04:25:49,130
Fuck, he's half!

5654
04:25:50,470 --> 04:25:51,930
Oh my god!

5655
04:25:52,850 --> 04:25:54,110
Where's our portal?

5656
04:25:56,150 --> 04:25:56,830
No!

5657
04:25:57,110 --> 04:25:59,630
We just got Loki on and he died with it!

5658
04:26:00,090 --> 04:26:02,270
No, he copied Strange!

5659
04:26:04,510 --> 04:26:06,750
I thought you would copy Luna.

5660
04:26:12,510 --> 04:26:13,950
There's Strange at portal.

5661
04:26:14,410 --> 04:26:15,950
There's Strange at...

5662
04:26:15,950 --> 04:26:16,990
That's what I'm saying!

5663
04:26:17,110 --> 04:26:23,090
If you're a fucking Jeff one-trick, you're crazy good at your fucking one-trick.

5664
04:26:23,590 --> 04:26:25,410
I have to remember names.

5665
04:26:25,510 --> 04:26:28,690
There's too many one-tricks in the... There's too many one-tricks.

5666
04:26:31,130 --> 04:26:34,170
So like, I need to remember their one-tricks and stuff.

5667
04:26:34,510 --> 04:26:37,010
I like... Oh my god, why did we not fucking...

5668
04:26:38,650 --> 04:26:39,870
Just shoot him.

5669
04:26:39,870 --> 04:26:41,990
Just fucking shoot him.

5670
04:26:43,670 --> 04:26:47,270
Literally, at one point I was the only one that shot the Jeff.

5671
04:26:47,970 --> 04:26:50,110
Literally, I was the only one.

5672
04:26:55,890 --> 04:26:57,450
I don't know why.

5673
04:26:59,310 --> 04:27:03,290
Why was I the only one that shot that fucking shark that was in the back line?

5674
04:27:03,390 --> 04:27:05,930
We just needed to, you know, pew pew.

5675
04:27:09,870 --> 04:27:11,490
Fucking punt the shark.

5676
04:27:12,150 --> 04:27:13,370
Fuck Jeffs.

5677
04:27:14,410 --> 04:27:16,010
Honestly, Jaws was right.

5678
04:27:16,530 --> 04:27:18,930
I wish I could punch a shark right now.

5679
04:27:20,370 --> 04:27:23,990
I could've said something really fucked up and it had something to do with SeaWorld.

5680
04:27:24,570 --> 04:27:28,610
I hope SeaWorld keeps bringing sharks in.

5681
04:27:32,370 --> 04:27:34,150
This game made me a hater.

5682
04:27:39,870 --> 04:27:41,330
I'm a fuck... Yes, I'm a hater.

5683
04:27:51,330 --> 04:27:54,110
Oh my god, the worst part is like I can't freeze him when he's in that form.

5684
04:27:54,690 --> 04:27:55,230
Cause that hit.

5685
04:27:55,370 --> 04:27:56,670
That absolutely hit.

5686
04:28:01,250 --> 04:28:02,370
A Sightlock top left.

5687
04:28:04,210 --> 04:28:05,650
Guys, I can't heal all of you.

5688
04:28:05,990 --> 04:28:06,990
Guys, you're all...

5689
04:28:07,450 --> 04:28:08,850
You're all critical.

5690
04:28:10,850 --> 04:28:12,250
Oh my god.

5691
04:28:14,070 --> 04:28:17,150
Why would you go Cloak but not Mantis?

5692
04:28:19,570 --> 04:28:21,170
Mantis is a fucking choice.

5693
04:28:31,010 --> 04:28:31,370
Alright.

5694
04:28:39,130 --> 04:28:39,790
It's fine.

5695
04:28:40,190 --> 04:28:41,050
Jeff is half.

5696
04:28:41,230 --> 04:28:41,590
Jeff is low.

5697
04:28:41,670 --> 04:28:42,050
Jeff is low.

5698
04:28:43,570 --> 04:28:44,750
Okay, I had to use my ult.

5699
04:28:46,930 --> 04:28:49,030
Oh, I didn't have to use my ult.

5700
04:28:58,050 --> 04:29:00,350
I gotta keep my KDA, guys.

5701
04:29:01,790 --> 04:29:06,550
Guys, I had to because I had to keep my KDA.

5702
04:29:09,630 --> 04:29:11,130
You guys don't understand.

5703
04:29:11,230 --> 04:29:12,710
The KDA was so important.

5704
04:29:12,710 --> 04:29:13,190
Guys.

5705
04:29:17,070 --> 04:29:17,910
No, they have Jeff ult.

5706
04:29:22,950 --> 04:29:23,690
Up quick.

5707
04:29:24,270 --> 04:29:26,290
Oh, and they had that ult too.

5708
04:29:26,970 --> 04:29:28,790
Where the fuck did he come from?

5709
04:29:29,190 --> 04:29:31,430
Oh shit, that's where he came from.

5710
04:29:34,430 --> 04:29:35,890
It's alright, we didn't need it.

5711
04:29:36,550 --> 04:29:38,770
I literally am 50% away from another ult.

5712
04:29:39,890 --> 04:29:40,970
We don't need it, guys.

5713
04:29:41,050 --> 04:29:42,790
We wanted to secure the cap.

5714
04:29:42,790 --> 04:29:44,920
Ooh, that's a nice headshot.

5715
04:29:48,050 --> 04:29:50,450
There's a Jeff behind us.

5716
04:29:51,170 --> 04:29:58,150
Gotta heal our tank.

5717
04:30:00,390 --> 04:30:01,730
Gotta heal our tank.

5718
04:30:03,810 --> 04:30:05,230
Yeah, you're not living.

5719
04:30:05,510 --> 04:30:06,290
You're not living.

5720
04:30:06,850 --> 04:30:08,910
You're absolutely not living.

5721
04:30:09,730 --> 04:30:10,690
I don't know what...

5722
04:30:10,690 --> 04:30:10,950
Did he?

5723
04:30:11,150 --> 04:30:11,910
Okay, yeah.

5724
04:30:13,110 --> 04:30:14,290
You're not living that.

5725
04:30:18,610 --> 04:30:19,530
I think...

5726
04:30:19,530 --> 04:30:21,310
Oh, there's Jeff on me.

5727
04:30:27,410 --> 04:30:28,010
Alright.

5728
04:30:30,890 --> 04:30:32,390
Jeff is so low too.

5729
04:30:38,600 --> 04:30:40,080
Oh my god!

5730
04:30:41,180 --> 04:30:46,320
Oh my god, I just watched him fucking walk into that and died.

5731
04:30:47,820 --> 04:30:49,260
Holy shit.

5732
04:30:51,240 --> 04:30:52,660
That's crazy.

5733
04:30:53,240 --> 04:30:56,020
I can't believe I watched that happen in front of me.

5734
04:30:56,920 --> 04:30:58,820
I don't think we win this.

5735
04:31:01,560 --> 04:31:05,420
I... Is that even a good ult?

5736
04:31:05,760 --> 04:31:06,300
Okay.

5737
04:31:06,820 --> 04:31:07,840
I don't...

5738
04:31:08,680 --> 04:31:10,200
It's gonna be fine, right?

5739
04:31:10,960 --> 04:31:12,740
You're so healthy.

5740
04:31:13,220 --> 04:31:15,420
I don't...

5741
04:31:15,420 --> 04:31:18,680
Guys, I have a feeling...

5742
04:31:18,680 --> 04:31:18,960
Alright.

5743
04:31:20,880 --> 04:31:21,600
Can we?

5744
04:31:23,220 --> 04:31:24,620
I'll just stand here.

5745
04:31:25,120 --> 04:31:26,920
Hey guys, do your thing.

5746
04:31:27,100 --> 04:31:28,340
I'm not even gonna move.

5747
04:31:28,460 --> 04:31:30,080
They can't even one-shot me.

5748
04:31:35,510 --> 04:31:36,450
Oh no.

5749
04:31:37,430 --> 04:31:38,610
Guys, this doesn't seem winnable.

5750
04:31:42,810 --> 04:31:44,070
Alright, I'm not looking.

5751
04:31:44,410 --> 04:31:45,130
I'm not looking.

5752
04:31:45,310 --> 04:31:46,610
I'm not... Don't look at this.

5753
04:31:46,830 --> 04:31:49,390
You will die instantly, guys.

5754
04:31:49,590 --> 04:31:50,930
Just walk backwards.

5755
04:31:51,690 --> 04:31:53,070
Hiding is an option.

5756
04:31:53,950 --> 04:31:54,650
Or not.

5757
04:31:56,330 --> 04:31:57,370
Fucking idiot.

5758
04:32:00,570 --> 04:32:01,370
Oh shit!

5759
04:32:01,930 --> 04:32:02,490
Woah!

5760
04:32:02,850 --> 04:32:03,090
Jeff!

5761
04:32:03,110 --> 04:32:03,870
Hey there, Jeff!

5762
04:32:06,490 --> 04:32:07,190
Oh shit!

5763
04:32:07,710 --> 04:32:08,750
I got baited!

5764
04:32:08,810 --> 04:32:10,410
I was gonna fuck around with Jeff!

5765
04:32:13,210 --> 04:32:15,570
I actually fucked me around!

5766
04:32:16,710 --> 04:32:19,670
He was just going around, and I was just like, eh.

5767
04:32:20,950 --> 04:32:22,610
I don't...

5768
04:32:22,610 --> 04:32:26,670
Guys, this is not looking so good.

5769
04:32:29,090 --> 04:32:30,530
I don't...

5770
04:32:30,530 --> 04:32:32,150
This is absolutely...

5771
04:32:32,150 --> 04:32:34,790
Like, what is this game?

5772
04:32:35,350 --> 04:32:35,870
Anyway.

5773
04:32:36,790 --> 04:32:38,290
Like, what am I...

5774
04:32:39,410 --> 04:32:41,550
What am I looking at?

5775
04:32:44,630 --> 04:32:47,210
What the fuck am I looking at?

5776
04:32:47,830 --> 04:32:48,470
Like...

5777
04:32:49,770 --> 04:32:50,730
Guys...

5778
04:32:50,730 --> 04:32:51,870
I think...

5779
04:32:55,930 --> 04:32:56,890
Guys...

5780
04:32:56,890 --> 04:32:59,190
Like, is everybody okay?

5781
04:32:59,570 --> 04:33:01,430
I don't think everybody is okay.

5782
04:33:01,910 --> 04:33:04,670
Oh my god, we got a pick.

5783
04:33:04,870 --> 04:33:06,050
That's crazy.

5784
04:33:07,190 --> 04:33:09,670
That's absolutely crazy.

5785
04:33:14,650 --> 04:33:16,090
Oh my god.

5786
04:33:18,910 --> 04:33:20,290
I'm just gonna...

5787
04:33:20,290 --> 04:33:21,230
chill up here.

5788
04:33:22,370 --> 04:33:24,590
Is he gonna do Eye of...

5789
04:33:24,590 --> 04:33:24,950
Eye?

5790
04:33:25,090 --> 04:33:26,130
I know you have it.

5791
04:33:27,310 --> 04:33:28,950
I know you have the Eye.

5792
04:33:32,290 --> 04:33:34,350
You're so healthy, everybody.

5793
04:33:35,030 --> 04:33:38,210
Oh my god, we moved the panel just a little bit more!

5794
04:33:38,730 --> 04:33:39,830
That's crazy.

5795
04:33:41,390 --> 04:33:42,650
I'm still playing my game.

5796
04:33:42,650 --> 04:33:44,150
I just...

5797
04:33:44,150 --> 04:33:46,650
I just don't think that...

5798
04:33:49,930 --> 04:33:51,610
I don't know.

5799
04:33:52,850 --> 04:33:53,410
It's...

5800
04:33:53,410 --> 04:33:56,650
It's looking a little...

5801
04:33:59,250 --> 04:34:00,370
It's looking...

5802
04:34:00,370 --> 04:34:03,110
It's looking a little...

5803
04:34:03,850 --> 04:34:06,430
If you wake him up, I swear to god...

5804
04:34:06,430 --> 04:34:08,830
If you... Oh, at least he didn't wake him up though.

5805
04:34:08,830 --> 04:34:10,790
It's just...

5806
04:34:10,790 --> 04:34:11,890
Nobody wants to help me.

5807
04:34:12,610 --> 04:34:13,030
Nobody!

5808
04:34:18,750 --> 04:34:19,970
That's okay.

5809
04:34:20,950 --> 04:34:23,030
Nobody wants to help me.

5810
04:34:27,850 --> 04:34:30,210
What is this queue?

5811
04:34:31,510 --> 04:34:32,770
You suck?

5812
04:34:32,990 --> 04:34:35,390
Bro was not on the winning team!

5813
04:34:40,130 --> 04:34:40,770
Alright.

5814
04:34:40,970 --> 04:34:41,970
I don't know who to avoid.

5815
04:34:42,330 --> 04:34:43,830
Everybody was pretty bad.

5816
04:34:47,660 --> 04:34:52,700
Just don't play DPS when you fed on tank when I was on support.

5817
04:34:53,520 --> 04:34:54,100
Who?

5818
04:34:54,500 --> 04:34:55,000
What?

5819
04:34:57,620 --> 04:34:59,620
Who are we yelling at?

5820
04:35:02,100 --> 04:35:02,740
Like...

5821
04:35:02,740 --> 04:35:05,120
Who's... Who were we yelling at there?

5822
04:35:06,360 --> 04:35:08,920
Like, everybody seems to be the problem.

5823
04:35:09,200 --> 04:35:10,820
I don't know who we're yelling at.

5824
04:35:12,220 --> 04:35:12,780
Yes.

5825
04:35:13,920 --> 04:35:14,500
I mean...

5826
04:35:15,040 --> 04:35:16,500
Lowest damage output...

5827
04:35:24,500 --> 04:35:25,620
It's not...

5828
04:35:25,620 --> 04:35:27,040
50% win rate.

5829
04:35:27,340 --> 04:35:28,040
That's fine.

5830
04:35:29,900 --> 04:35:31,880
I mean, he has a good win rate on Punisher.

5831
04:35:33,280 --> 04:35:34,260
He has a...

5832
04:35:37,440 --> 04:35:39,920
I mean, he's a good support player.

5833
04:35:40,360 --> 04:35:41,720
I don't really need to avoid him.

5834
04:35:41,720 --> 04:35:43,500
Unless he's a...

5835
04:35:43,500 --> 04:35:45,060
He was the one that plays low-key, right?

5836
04:35:48,310 --> 04:35:48,810
64?

5837
04:35:49,150 --> 04:35:50,950
That's more than 50%.

5838
04:35:51,670 --> 04:35:53,850
Oh, when he is on cloak, he doesn't care.

5839
04:35:59,850 --> 04:36:01,630
He just doesn't care.

5840
04:36:02,250 --> 04:36:04,590
You guys want to see my cloak win rate?

5841
04:36:05,050 --> 04:36:07,470
That's when I care, but I still lose.

5842
04:36:09,710 --> 04:36:10,910
Or is it...

5843
04:36:13,630 --> 04:36:16,790
That's when I care, but I still lose.

5844
04:36:22,530 --> 04:36:23,030
Okay.

5845
04:36:27,930 --> 04:36:28,970
I don't know who to avoid.

5846
04:36:29,530 --> 04:36:30,830
I'll avoid the low-key player.

5847
04:36:32,510 --> 04:36:33,050
I don't know.

5848
04:36:33,130 --> 04:36:34,410
They all... I don't know.

5849
04:36:36,490 --> 04:36:36,990
Pretty...

5850
04:36:36,990 --> 04:36:38,490
We're all bad.

5851
04:36:40,490 --> 04:36:40,990
We're...

5852
04:36:42,770 --> 04:36:44,550
We're all pretty bad as a team.

5853
04:36:44,750 --> 04:36:46,990
I think Ruben must have...

5854
04:36:48,070 --> 04:36:48,510
Oh.

5855
04:36:48,830 --> 04:36:49,270
We cancelled.

5856
04:36:49,790 --> 04:36:52,650
I don't want to queue against... We're going to go against them.

5857
04:36:52,750 --> 04:36:53,930
I don't want to queue against them.

5858
04:36:55,010 --> 04:36:56,850
I really don't want to queue against them.

5859
04:36:57,010 --> 04:36:57,250
Honestly.

5860
04:36:58,950 --> 04:37:00,250
Wait, was it...

5861
04:37:01,970 --> 04:37:02,850
Mace was...

5862
04:37:03,970 --> 04:37:04,410
M...

5863
04:37:04,890 --> 04:37:05,330
M4C?

5864
04:37:07,270 --> 04:37:08,390
Yeah, this is Mace, right?

5865
04:37:09,590 --> 04:37:10,090
No.

5866
04:37:10,230 --> 04:37:11,170
That's not the Mace.

5867
04:37:12,050 --> 04:37:15,070
I know Mendo has his profile hidden.

5868
04:37:15,890 --> 04:37:16,910
Was it just Mace?

5869
04:37:17,430 --> 04:37:18,470
Oh, it's just Mace.

5870
04:37:18,570 --> 04:37:18,850
Okay.

5871
04:37:20,270 --> 04:37:20,770
Yeah.

5872
04:37:21,430 --> 04:37:22,830
He's one above all?

5873
04:37:23,190 --> 04:37:23,990
Oh wait, no.

5874
04:37:24,090 --> 04:37:25,130
That's not the right Mace.

5875
04:37:25,310 --> 04:37:26,670
Wait, is this the same Mace?

5876
04:37:28,090 --> 04:37:29,610
Did he got Mace on an alt account?

5877
04:37:30,630 --> 04:37:32,230
Did he got... Oh my god!

5878
04:37:35,670 --> 04:37:37,330
Oh my god!

5879
04:37:37,330 --> 04:37:38,190
Oh my fucking god!

5880
04:37:39,090 --> 04:37:40,910
Ruben, I hope you know I...

5881
04:37:40,910 --> 04:37:43,650
I hope you know I fucking...

5882
04:38:04,080 --> 04:38:06,160
You're not hearing him!

5883
04:38:12,360 --> 04:38:13,300
You're not hearing him!

5884
04:38:13,300 --> 04:38:14,600
I gave away a free ticket.

5885
04:38:17,880 --> 04:38:18,820
What?!

5886
04:38:18,820 --> 04:38:21,020
You told me this now!

5887
04:38:26,720 --> 04:38:28,240
Ruben, I...

5888
04:38:28,240 --> 04:38:30,180
I haven't slept yet!

5889
04:38:37,010 --> 04:38:38,250
I've been...

5890
04:38:38,250 --> 04:38:40,090
I've been...

5891
04:38:40,090 --> 04:38:44,050
I've been up since 11am.

5892
04:38:49,780 --> 04:38:51,280
No way!

5893
04:38:52,380 --> 04:38:54,140
Mace is rank one!

5894
04:38:54,540 --> 04:38:56,140
No fucking way!

5895
04:38:58,020 --> 04:39:00,260
No, I'm fucking... I had gamer subs before.

5896
04:39:00,660 --> 04:39:01,300
Is he in-game?

5897
04:39:01,460 --> 04:39:01,820
They're in-game.

5898
04:39:01,920 --> 04:39:02,100
Alright.

5899
04:39:05,160 --> 04:39:06,720
We're up two.

5900
04:39:06,860 --> 04:39:07,620
No, I'm not!

5901
04:39:09,840 --> 04:39:11,000
I'm not!

5902
04:39:19,980 --> 04:39:21,260
I'm not!

5903
04:39:21,820 --> 04:39:22,680
I'm literally...

5904
04:39:22,680 --> 04:39:25,060
I started at this elo when I got up.

5905
04:39:30,390 --> 04:39:32,070
What the fuck do you mean?

5906
04:39:32,150 --> 04:39:33,490
This is a rank one...

5907
04:39:33,490 --> 04:39:34,810
I didn't realize.

5908
04:39:34,990 --> 04:39:35,910
I was like...

5909
04:39:35,910 --> 04:39:37,910
Oh yeah, I got so many...

5910
04:39:43,750 --> 04:39:45,430
Oh my god.

5911
04:39:45,950 --> 04:39:47,890
I'm not doing 24 hours, Ruben.

5912
04:39:48,210 --> 04:39:49,990
Ruben, I'm not doing 24 hours.

5913
04:39:50,190 --> 04:39:51,850
I'm fucking...

5914
04:39:52,730 --> 04:39:55,450
If we lose the next game, I'm sorry Ruben.

5915
04:39:55,550 --> 04:39:56,770
I need it.

5916
04:39:57,470 --> 04:40:01,850
A four stack is like the most guaranteed shit ever.

5917
04:40:02,430 --> 04:40:03,690
I wanna be like Shroud.

5918
04:40:04,250 --> 04:40:06,950
I wanna be like Shroud.

5919
04:40:13,330 --> 04:40:14,450
Shroud had...

5920
04:40:14,450 --> 04:40:16,690
Now you say that.

5921
04:40:17,190 --> 04:40:20,350
I didn't think I'd be up for 24 hours, chat.

5922
04:40:23,470 --> 04:40:25,670
I didn't think I'd be up for 24 hours.

5923
04:40:33,240 --> 04:40:33,800
Guys,

5924
04:40:38,210 --> 04:40:39,350
I don't know everybody.

5925
04:40:39,710 --> 04:40:41,190
I literally just ganked.

5926
04:40:41,310 --> 04:40:43,970
I know pro players, but there's no pros yet.

5927
04:40:43,970 --> 04:40:47,650
There's literally no fucking pros yet in Marvel Rivals.

5928
04:40:47,830 --> 04:40:49,970
There's tournaments, but they're not...

5929
04:40:49,970 --> 04:40:52,630
It's like they're like getting Overwatch pros.

5930
04:40:55,090 --> 04:41:01,790
It's like getting Overwatch pros into Marvel Rivals, but it's not actual like pros in the scene, so I don't know who's good.

5931
04:41:02,990 --> 04:41:03,910
I don't pay attention to that.

5932
04:41:04,070 --> 04:41:08,330
I only know like a couple of Overwatch players and a couple of Apex players and then nothing in between.

5933
04:41:08,650 --> 04:41:09,270
And Shroud.

5934
04:41:09,490 --> 04:41:10,870
Because everybody knows Shroud.

5935
04:41:10,870 --> 04:41:12,670
Oh wait, Mace is in chat?

5936
04:41:17,990 --> 04:41:19,510
I can't believe it.

5937
04:41:19,930 --> 04:41:20,910
I can't believe they won.

5938
04:41:21,030 --> 04:41:23,370
I can't believe they won every game.

5939
04:41:25,190 --> 04:41:26,070
Hey, Mace!

5940
04:41:27,870 --> 04:41:28,770
Wait, it's Mason!

5941
04:41:31,890 --> 04:41:33,870
Wait, what game is Mace from?

5942
04:41:34,850 --> 04:41:36,050
Yo, can we be on the same page, man?

5943
04:41:36,590 --> 04:41:38,250
Sorry, my bad!

5944
04:41:40,070 --> 04:41:40,510
No!

5945
04:41:42,710 --> 04:41:44,110
Can you play Hello or not?

5946
04:41:44,510 --> 04:41:45,310
Do we have a Hello player?

5947
04:41:52,330 --> 04:41:54,530
Do we have a Hello player?

5948
04:42:11,070 --> 04:42:12,410
It's all good, it's all good.

5949
04:42:14,030 --> 04:42:14,550
Alright.

5950
04:42:14,890 --> 04:42:16,230
Do we have...

5951
04:42:16,230 --> 04:42:18,490
Do we have a...

5952
04:42:20,990 --> 04:42:23,550
Do we have a Hello player?

5953
04:42:23,550 --> 04:42:23,670
Dude!

5954
04:42:31,290 --> 04:42:32,510
That was pretty good.

5955
04:42:32,730 --> 04:42:33,570
Oh my god.

5956
04:42:37,450 --> 04:42:38,330
I've been...

5957
04:42:38,330 --> 04:42:40,010
He won't stop until the turn.

5958
04:42:40,110 --> 04:42:41,450
I will fucking...

5959
04:42:41,450 --> 04:42:43,470
I will commit.

5960
04:42:44,670 --> 04:42:46,470
I don't have a YouTube stream today.

5961
04:42:48,070 --> 04:42:49,490
To be fair, I don't make my own skit.

5962
04:42:49,490 --> 04:42:51,010
I don't have any commitments today.

5963
04:42:51,070 --> 04:42:53,230
I just want to be the big guy, but you just want to play DPS.

5964
04:42:53,610 --> 04:42:55,050
Fuck, I would mute your countdown, though.

5965
04:42:55,370 --> 04:42:55,770
We would.

5966
04:42:57,330 --> 04:42:57,730
Wow!

5967
04:42:59,590 --> 04:43:02,150
Gotta tell my thumbnail maker to mute your countdown.

5968
04:43:03,590 --> 04:43:03,990
Alright.

5969
04:43:05,430 --> 04:43:06,450
We banned Hulk?

5970
04:43:06,630 --> 04:43:07,150
We did.

5971
04:43:07,710 --> 04:43:08,110
It's fine.

5972
04:43:08,370 --> 04:43:08,950
Hulk is bad.

5973
04:43:11,270 --> 04:43:14,450
We also banned Hulk, so like, what the fuck is he gonna do to us?

5974
04:43:15,830 --> 04:43:16,990
Like, kill us?

5975
04:43:17,910 --> 04:43:19,290
With what damage?

5976
04:43:27,170 --> 04:43:28,290
Oh, shit!

5977
04:43:28,570 --> 04:43:29,330
Got some squids.

5978
04:43:29,870 --> 04:43:30,430
Please.

5979
04:43:32,930 --> 04:43:33,490
Okay.

5980
04:43:34,010 --> 04:43:34,830
I got healed.

5981
04:43:36,190 --> 04:43:36,750
Oh,

5982
04:43:40,150 --> 04:43:40,570
goodbye.

5983
04:43:40,890 --> 04:43:43,430
Don't worry, our Hella's gonna get that one kill that's gonna rez him.

5984
04:43:43,430 --> 04:43:45,470
I believe.

5985
04:43:47,970 --> 04:43:49,210
Any day now.

5986
04:43:49,590 --> 04:43:51,490
Any fucking day now.

5987
04:43:51,930 --> 04:43:54,950
You're gonna get that one kill that's gonna rez him.

5988
04:43:55,410 --> 04:43:57,130
Oh, never mind, he's back.

5989
04:43:58,050 --> 04:43:58,590
Okay.

5990
04:44:01,530 --> 04:44:02,910
Never mind.

5991
04:44:03,150 --> 04:44:03,970
He's alive.

5992
04:44:06,970 --> 04:44:08,690
Guys, please.

5993
04:44:10,550 --> 04:44:13,730
Alright, she's gonna get that one kill that's gonna rez our Thor again.

5994
04:44:15,130 --> 04:44:16,110
Any day now.

5995
04:44:19,630 --> 04:44:20,990
He's gonna do it.

5996
04:44:23,590 --> 04:44:24,030
Right here.

5997
04:44:25,230 --> 04:44:25,930
Our Thor is back.

5998
04:44:26,030 --> 04:44:26,550
She did it.

5999
04:44:29,390 --> 04:44:30,790
She fucking did it.

6000
04:44:30,890 --> 04:44:31,490
I knew he could.

6001
04:44:32,010 --> 04:44:32,890
See, our Thor is back.

6002
04:44:33,050 --> 04:44:34,250
He got the pick, right?

6003
04:44:35,630 --> 04:44:36,310
Got the kill.

6004
04:44:41,490 --> 04:44:42,430
I think I go.

6005
04:44:48,190 --> 04:44:49,430
Oh, that's when he died.

6006
04:44:49,610 --> 04:44:50,030
Oh, wait.

6007
04:44:50,110 --> 04:44:50,790
We're all five.

6008
04:44:54,270 --> 04:44:55,530
There we go.

6009
04:44:56,910 --> 04:44:59,350
Don't worry, our Hella's gonna get killed where she's gonna resurrect herself.

6010
04:45:01,890 --> 04:45:04,270
I'm still alive because I'm not eternity yet.

6011
04:45:04,310 --> 04:45:05,430
I'm back where I started.

6012
04:45:11,070 --> 04:45:12,130
Any day now.

6013
04:45:16,850 --> 04:45:17,590
Good guy.

6014
04:45:18,190 --> 04:45:19,530
Are we okay here?

6015
04:45:19,730 --> 04:45:20,790
We're okay here.

6016
04:45:21,250 --> 04:45:22,050
We're fine.

6017
04:45:22,910 --> 04:45:26,390
Thank you for the gift itself.

6018
04:45:26,530 --> 04:45:27,230
Thank you.

6019
04:45:27,290 --> 04:45:28,110
Five and ten.

6020
04:45:29,470 --> 04:45:30,390
Really appreciate it.

6021
04:45:30,410 --> 04:45:31,070
Thank you so much.

6022
04:45:32,310 --> 04:45:32,690
Wait.

6023
04:45:33,450 --> 04:45:34,410
Where are you?

6024
04:45:39,910 --> 04:45:40,870
That's fine.

6025
04:45:41,090 --> 04:45:41,670
Let's just...

6026
04:45:41,670 --> 04:45:42,270
You know what?

6027
04:45:42,550 --> 04:45:42,970
I believe.

6028
04:45:43,150 --> 04:45:43,930
Let's commit to this.

6029
04:45:46,890 --> 04:45:48,050
That's five.

6030
04:45:50,210 --> 04:45:51,770
Namor behind us.

6031
04:45:54,090 --> 04:45:55,150
Yeah, he's half.

6032
04:45:55,970 --> 04:45:56,750
He's low.

6033
04:45:56,950 --> 04:45:57,670
I can deal with him.

6034
04:45:58,730 --> 04:45:58,930
Alright.

6035
04:46:03,010 --> 04:46:04,150
Did you deal with it?

6036
04:46:06,830 --> 04:46:07,950
Oh my god.

6037
04:46:08,010 --> 04:46:08,530
That's five.

6038
04:46:11,110 --> 04:46:12,010
Strange one.

6039
04:46:13,090 --> 04:46:13,670
Okay, Strange.

6040
04:46:13,670 --> 04:46:14,710
Stop.

6041
04:46:16,890 --> 04:46:17,730
I think I...

6042
04:46:17,730 --> 04:46:19,390
My mic doesn't work again.

6043
04:46:20,430 --> 04:46:21,730
Are you serious?

6044
04:46:22,050 --> 04:46:23,930
My mic doesn't work.

6045
04:46:24,390 --> 04:46:26,330
I looked up in the sky.

6046
04:46:27,730 --> 04:46:30,190
With nobody else shooting him.

6047
04:46:31,710 --> 04:46:32,690
It's fine.

6048
04:46:33,590 --> 04:46:35,110
I don't want people to listen to me anyway.

6049
04:46:35,410 --> 04:46:36,830
I don't give good comms.

6050
04:46:38,170 --> 04:46:39,490
Who cares about my opinion?

6051
04:46:39,490 --> 04:46:40,010
It's fine.

6052
04:46:41,950 --> 04:46:43,070
Who cares?

6053
04:46:48,740 --> 04:46:49,300
Alright.

6054
04:46:51,440 --> 04:46:53,260
Yeah, I'm on my push to talk.

6055
04:46:54,960 --> 04:46:56,480
I'm just blowing up this Strange field.

6056
04:46:56,980 --> 04:46:58,140
We're so healthy.

6057
04:46:59,120 --> 04:47:00,280
We're so healthy.

6058
04:47:01,780 --> 04:47:03,540
We're so fucking healthy.

6059
04:47:05,420 --> 04:47:06,540
We're so...

6060
04:47:06,540 --> 04:47:07,960
That's what I'm saying.

6061
04:47:07,960 --> 04:47:09,400
This Ironman can't do...

6062
04:47:12,580 --> 04:47:13,740
That's awkward.

6063
04:47:21,540 --> 04:47:23,220
Until now.

6064
04:47:26,160 --> 04:47:27,000
Until...

6065
04:47:29,960 --> 04:47:32,280
Okay, but like...

6066
04:47:32,280 --> 04:47:33,640
Who would've thought...

6067
04:47:33,640 --> 04:47:36,140
The only kills he got was like...

6068
04:47:36,140 --> 04:47:37,060
With his ult.

6069
04:47:37,540 --> 04:47:38,880
Who would've thought?

6070
04:47:39,980 --> 04:47:42,600
None of us would've known that.

6071
04:47:44,240 --> 04:47:47,040
How was I supposed to know that?

6072
04:47:50,280 --> 04:47:52,040
I feel like...

6073
04:47:52,040 --> 04:47:54,320
We don't need ult here yet.

6074
04:47:54,520 --> 04:47:55,400
I can save.

6075
04:47:55,500 --> 04:47:56,140
I have restraint.

6076
04:47:58,360 --> 04:47:58,740
Okay.

6077
04:48:00,780 --> 04:48:02,500
Do I live through this?

6078
04:48:02,900 --> 04:48:03,620
Where's my...

6079
04:48:03,620 --> 04:48:03,940
Oh!

6080
04:48:05,500 --> 04:48:06,340
Where's Reuben?

6081
04:48:06,520 --> 04:48:07,540
I need to see this.

6082
04:48:11,800 --> 04:48:14,000
He was up ahead of me.

6083
04:48:24,280 --> 04:48:31,500
I thought I could live through that.

6084
04:48:33,620 --> 04:48:34,620
I really did.

6085
04:48:40,260 --> 04:48:42,560
I thought I could live through that.

6086
04:48:45,100 --> 04:48:46,520
Alright, let's see.

6087
04:48:47,380 --> 04:48:49,480
I wasn't keeping track because I was like...

6088
04:48:49,480 --> 04:48:51,020
Where the fuck was my Mantis up?

6089
04:48:55,640 --> 04:48:58,940
Oh, let's go!

6090
04:48:59,500 --> 04:49:01,220
Let's commit to this!

6091
04:49:01,340 --> 04:49:02,100
Let's go!

6092
04:49:03,820 --> 04:49:04,340
Yippee!

6093
04:49:05,180 --> 04:49:06,580
Let's commit to this!

6094
04:49:06,700 --> 04:49:07,640
I'm dancing!

6095
04:49:08,560 --> 04:49:09,940
Oh my god!

6096
04:49:10,060 --> 04:49:12,100
I'm fucking killing you too.

6097
04:49:13,140 --> 04:49:13,680
There we go.

6098
04:49:15,480 --> 04:49:15,820
Nice.

6099
04:49:17,900 --> 04:49:18,940
That's nice.

6100
04:49:20,440 --> 04:49:21,440
We're 3-4?

6101
04:49:23,460 --> 04:49:25,580
Okay, I thought you meant that was my record.

6102
04:49:25,700 --> 04:49:27,360
I was like, I'm pretty sure it's worse than that.

6103
04:49:27,720 --> 04:49:29,360
I was like, there's no way.

6104
04:49:32,420 --> 04:49:33,520
There's no way.

6105
04:49:34,860 --> 04:49:35,540
I was like, there's no way.

6106
04:49:42,240 --> 04:49:43,440
Thank you!

6107
04:49:48,430 --> 04:49:49,030
Alright.

6108
04:49:49,330 --> 04:49:50,510
No, I have a problem.

6109
04:49:50,710 --> 04:49:52,230
I 100% have a problem.

6110
04:49:56,590 --> 04:49:57,450
I don't.

6111
04:49:57,570 --> 04:49:58,490
I can't quit anytime.

6112
04:49:59,990 --> 04:50:03,010
And I'm not doing anything about it.

6113
04:50:03,010 --> 04:50:06,350
I keep going.

6114
04:50:07,410 --> 04:50:08,210
I keep going.

6115
04:50:08,210 --> 04:50:10,010
I can play this for long hours.

6116
04:50:10,190 --> 04:50:10,390
I can play this for long hours.

6117
04:50:10,390 --> 04:50:10,850
Not gonna lie.

6118
04:50:11,950 --> 04:50:14,510
I'm just that severely addicted to Marble Rivals.

6119
04:50:14,510 --> 04:50:14,610
I'm just that severely addicted to Marble Rivals.

6120
04:50:15,490 --> 04:50:17,250
And I don't plan to.

6121
04:50:18,130 --> 04:50:18,810
And I don't plan to.

6122
04:50:19,270 --> 04:50:21,970
I don't plan to.

6123
04:50:29,310 --> 04:50:30,910
I don't plan to.

6124
04:50:30,930 --> 04:50:31,830
My problem exactly.

6125
04:50:31,990 --> 04:50:33,450
The problem is I'm not Eternity yet.

6126
04:50:33,730 --> 04:50:34,550
That's my problem.

6127
04:50:37,530 --> 04:50:39,250
It's not me, it's my teammates.

6128
04:50:40,310 --> 04:50:40,750
I think...

6129
04:50:41,330 --> 04:50:41,990
I don't know.

6130
04:50:42,270 --> 04:50:44,410
I feel like I can be Eternity.

6131
04:50:44,510 --> 04:50:47,530
I think my Luna is Eternity level.

6132
04:50:47,990 --> 04:50:50,830
My other supports maybe not Eternity level.

6133
04:50:55,410 --> 04:50:55,850
I don't know.

6134
04:50:55,850 --> 04:50:56,290
This is easy.

6135
04:50:56,550 --> 04:50:57,730
I woke him up though.

6136
04:50:59,890 --> 04:51:00,710
Look at that.

6137
04:51:00,850 --> 04:51:01,630
I'm a real homie.

6138
04:51:01,770 --> 04:51:03,290
I woke him up when no one else would.

6139
04:51:09,110 --> 04:51:11,010
I guess I'll heal myself.

6140
04:51:12,010 --> 04:51:12,630
I guess...

6141
04:51:12,630 --> 04:51:12,850
Wow!

6142
04:51:14,130 --> 04:51:14,450
Okay.

6143
04:51:17,530 --> 04:51:18,210
Okay.

6144
04:51:18,310 --> 04:51:20,070
Sure, I would love to.

6145
04:51:20,890 --> 04:51:24,610
I would love to if I'm not fucking blocked in right now.

6146
04:51:25,490 --> 04:51:27,310
It's just things that are alive.

6147
04:51:30,130 --> 04:51:31,330
It's just you.

6148
04:51:31,810 --> 04:51:32,470
Good luck.

6149
04:51:33,090 --> 04:51:34,610
Why did you push him?

6150
04:51:35,290 --> 04:51:36,350
I should've froze him.

6151
04:51:38,910 --> 04:51:39,850
Oh my god.

6152
04:51:40,250 --> 04:51:41,710
He pushed him forward.

6153
04:51:46,870 --> 04:51:49,690
I could've froze him and then he could've lived.

6154
04:51:50,350 --> 04:51:51,690
Are they back on Ironman?

6155
04:51:51,930 --> 04:51:52,370
Why?

6156
04:51:53,090 --> 04:51:54,710
You have no Hulk player.

6157
04:51:56,330 --> 04:51:57,710
Like, what's the point?

6158
04:51:58,030 --> 04:51:58,830
Your ace?

6159
04:51:59,210 --> 04:52:00,430
Who did you kill?

6160
04:52:03,450 --> 04:52:06,630
Who the fuck did you kill to get that ace?

6161
04:52:09,730 --> 04:52:12,890
I legitimately feel like...

6162
04:52:12,890 --> 04:52:13,830
Oh my god.

6163
04:52:13,830 --> 04:52:16,250
I thought he did like zero things.

6164
04:52:16,850 --> 04:52:19,970
I didn't even realize he existed in my game.

6165
04:52:22,110 --> 04:52:23,610
Oh, he's dead.

6166
04:52:23,610 --> 04:52:24,790
I'm dead as fuck.

6167
04:52:25,270 --> 04:52:29,070
Oh, oh, oh.

6168
04:52:29,390 --> 04:52:30,810
I didn't want to ult.

6169
04:52:39,130 --> 04:52:41,390
This is why I'm eternity level.

6170
04:52:41,390 --> 04:52:44,170
This is why I personally think I'm eternity.

6171
04:52:49,090 --> 04:52:50,890
Oh my god, I lived.

6172
04:52:52,290 --> 04:52:53,730
Oh my god.

6173
04:52:55,070 --> 04:52:56,530
I deserve that ring.

6174
04:52:56,730 --> 04:52:59,210
I fucking deserve that ring.

6175
04:53:03,750 --> 04:53:05,050
That's why I'm not ulting.

6176
04:53:06,630 --> 04:53:08,370
Oh, I need to reload my hands.

6177
04:53:09,590 --> 04:53:10,110
Oh...

6178
04:53:10,110 --> 04:53:11,090
You're so...

6179
04:53:12,770 --> 04:53:13,290
Oh...

6180
04:53:15,690 --> 04:53:16,210
Oh...

6181
04:53:16,210 --> 04:53:17,750
He still has strange ult.

6182
04:53:18,310 --> 04:53:19,250
I should've ulted that.

6183
04:53:19,710 --> 04:53:22,790
I didn't think they would...

6184
04:53:22,790 --> 04:53:23,870
Jarvis clipped that.

6185
04:53:24,150 --> 04:53:25,390
I didn't think they would die there.

6186
04:53:25,950 --> 04:53:26,830
I should've ulted that.

6187
04:53:28,510 --> 04:53:31,870
Maybe that's strange though, so I don't know if it's...

6188
04:53:31,870 --> 04:53:34,370
Oh my god, I froze somebody?

6189
04:53:35,130 --> 04:53:37,830
Bro, that is the furthest freeze I've ever hit.

6190
04:53:39,590 --> 04:53:44,630
I feel like strange is gonna fly up and be like...

6191
04:53:46,510 --> 04:53:49,090
I can feel the strange ult coming.

6192
04:53:50,270 --> 04:53:52,090
Until Magneto first, I guess.

6193
04:53:55,960 --> 04:53:57,380
He's like, saving it.

6194
04:53:57,580 --> 04:53:57,860
It's weird.

6195
04:54:00,020 --> 04:54:01,420
Did he open a portal?

6196
04:54:03,940 --> 04:54:04,860
Who the fuck?

6197
04:54:04,960 --> 04:54:05,120
Oh.

6198
04:54:09,360 --> 04:54:11,520
Jarvis, give me Eternity, please.

6199
04:54:12,780 --> 04:54:13,840
Please, Jarvis.

6200
04:54:17,320 --> 04:54:18,460
I mean,

6201
04:54:22,220 --> 04:54:23,120
we have...

6202
04:54:24,260 --> 04:54:25,680
Oh my god, this fucker's scary.

6203
04:54:27,020 --> 04:54:27,740
Please!

6204
04:54:28,360 --> 04:54:29,680
I have to reload hands!

6205
04:54:30,660 --> 04:54:33,260
You're taking so much damage!

6206
04:54:33,260 --> 04:54:34,320
Oh my god.

6207
04:54:34,760 --> 04:54:36,880
My hands can't reload fast enough for all this.

6208
04:54:39,260 --> 04:54:40,460
Okay, that's fine.

6209
04:54:41,820 --> 04:54:43,120
Maybe I froze somebody.

6210
04:54:43,740 --> 04:54:45,020
That was a hell-may-freeze.

6211
04:54:48,300 --> 04:54:50,660
He wants it so bad.

6212
04:54:54,220 --> 04:54:55,700
Are we killing anything?

6213
04:54:56,980 --> 04:54:57,720
Don't worry.

6214
04:54:58,200 --> 04:54:58,840
There we go!

6215
04:54:58,940 --> 04:55:00,280
I fucking did it!

6216
04:55:01,060 --> 04:55:01,540
Oh!

6217
04:55:03,980 --> 04:55:06,260
Alright, they're gonna combo that I'm not ulting.

6218
04:55:09,120 --> 04:55:09,600
Alright.

6219
04:55:10,200 --> 04:55:12,340
Well, now I know that's their combo.

6220
04:55:13,200 --> 04:55:14,860
I didn't think that was their combo.

6221
04:55:15,120 --> 04:55:16,800
Now I know they'll die.

6222
04:55:17,000 --> 04:55:19,660
I'm not gonna ult for a strange ult.

6223
04:55:20,640 --> 04:55:22,500
You can't live through that.

6224
04:55:23,740 --> 04:55:24,760
You're so bad.

6225
04:55:25,000 --> 04:55:25,740
You're so bad.

6226
04:55:25,760 --> 04:55:26,860
Your movement's so predictable.

6227
04:55:30,500 --> 04:55:33,680
Your movement is so predictable, buddy.

6228
04:55:37,280 --> 04:55:39,020
Just stay on point.

6229
04:55:39,880 --> 04:55:41,020
Just stay on point.

6230
04:55:45,320 --> 04:55:45,860
Goodbye.

6231
04:55:48,000 --> 04:55:48,540
Goodbye.

6232
04:55:49,060 --> 04:55:50,340
It was great seeing you.

6233
04:55:51,040 --> 04:55:52,240
Oh, I fucked up a little bit?

6234
04:55:52,680 --> 04:55:53,740
Oh yeah, a lot of it.

6235
04:55:54,180 --> 04:55:55,460
Dude, they're all on you.

6236
04:55:55,540 --> 04:55:55,900
Holy fuck.

6237
04:55:56,120 --> 04:55:56,920
Yeah, oops.

6238
04:55:56,920 --> 04:55:59,100
Oh my god!

6239
04:55:59,100 --> 04:56:00,160
No!

6240
04:56:04,290 --> 04:56:05,610
Alright.

6241
04:56:06,630 --> 04:56:12,090
This is looking a little bad here.

6242
04:56:12,850 --> 04:56:13,590
We are chilling.

6243
04:56:15,590 --> 04:56:18,770
This is our group here.

6244
04:56:20,410 --> 04:56:21,670
Nice.

6245
04:56:22,030 --> 04:56:22,630
Baited.

6246
04:56:24,310 --> 04:56:25,430
Alright, nice.

6247
04:56:25,430 --> 04:56:27,010
Wait, is our Thor okay?

6248
04:56:27,530 --> 04:56:28,390
He is so healthy.

6249
04:56:28,930 --> 04:56:30,970
He is so fucking healthy.

6250
04:56:32,530 --> 04:56:33,590
He is.

6251
04:56:35,170 --> 04:56:36,650
He is actually so healthy.

6252
04:56:37,130 --> 04:56:37,830
This is fine.

6253
04:56:38,990 --> 04:56:40,590
We're so healthy right here.

6254
04:56:46,590 --> 04:56:49,070
Okay, no, it's fine.

6255
04:56:51,050 --> 04:56:52,890
You're just poking us!

6256
04:56:53,530 --> 04:56:54,010
Do we have?

6257
04:56:54,490 --> 04:56:54,990
We do.

6258
04:56:54,990 --> 04:56:55,890
Please.

6259
04:56:56,290 --> 04:56:56,810
Please!

6260
04:56:57,070 --> 04:56:59,950
Oh my god.

6261
04:57:00,270 --> 04:57:01,310
We should have ulted this earlier.

6262
04:57:01,770 --> 04:57:03,510
Change one!

6263
04:57:03,650 --> 04:57:07,110
Change one in the air.

6264
04:57:07,970 --> 04:57:09,330
I need to fix my frames.

6265
04:57:09,750 --> 04:57:10,710
I'll be five seconds.

6266
04:57:14,950 --> 04:57:16,190
Fix your frames?

6267
04:57:18,190 --> 04:57:19,190
Guys, it's okay.

6268
04:57:19,290 --> 04:57:20,230
My opinion doesn't matter.

6269
04:57:22,270 --> 04:57:22,510
No!

6270
04:57:22,510 --> 04:57:24,030
Oh, he's back.

6271
04:57:24,250 --> 04:57:24,870
Oh, thank god.

6272
04:57:28,330 --> 04:57:29,850
I'm okay.

6273
04:57:30,710 --> 04:57:31,850
I'm okay.

6274
04:57:33,550 --> 04:57:35,090
Did they R-man ulted?

6275
04:57:36,050 --> 04:57:37,310
Yeah, they wasted it.

6276
04:57:38,650 --> 04:57:39,170
Alright.

6277
04:57:41,990 --> 04:57:42,750
No!

6278
04:57:46,370 --> 04:57:48,390
Come to me!

6279
04:57:50,190 --> 04:57:50,610
No!

6280
04:57:50,870 --> 04:57:52,130
They can't listen!

6281
04:57:52,850 --> 04:57:54,550
They just don't!

6282
04:57:55,390 --> 04:57:56,050
They don't!

6283
04:57:56,370 --> 04:57:57,650
Strange was one!

6284
04:57:58,210 --> 04:57:59,890
They heard me say...

6285
04:57:59,890 --> 04:58:01,170
Oh my god, please cover.

6286
04:58:01,490 --> 04:58:04,650
They heard me say Strange was one.

6287
04:58:13,690 --> 04:58:15,370
They heard...

6288
04:58:15,370 --> 04:58:17,170
He just didn't care.

6289
04:58:18,670 --> 04:58:19,790
I'm going to name one.

6290
04:58:24,750 --> 04:58:28,350
I had to reload hands.

6291
04:58:28,410 --> 04:58:28,890
I'm sorry.

6292
04:58:31,670 --> 04:58:34,050
I guess I touch point next.

6293
04:58:34,250 --> 04:58:35,370
I'm dead instantly.

6294
04:58:37,250 --> 04:58:39,110
Send Toki to rehab.

6295
04:58:43,370 --> 04:58:45,010
Can we play up top?

6296
04:58:46,430 --> 04:58:47,750
Because they're just going to get a portal.

6297
04:58:52,580 --> 04:58:54,180
Oh my god.

6298
04:58:55,860 --> 04:58:56,980
They should've listened.

6299
04:58:57,720 --> 04:58:59,240
They should've listened.

6300
04:59:02,080 --> 04:59:06,560
They let me look at a one HP Strange.

6301
04:59:06,800 --> 04:59:08,260
And nobody shot him.

6302
04:59:09,180 --> 04:59:10,080
I...

6303
04:59:10,080 --> 04:59:12,760
I don't know what to do.

6304
04:59:16,120 --> 04:59:18,360
I'm still GM1.

6305
04:59:19,800 --> 04:59:21,740
I'm still stuck in the trenches.

6306
04:59:33,000 --> 04:59:34,640
Jesus Christ, 12 deaths?

6307
04:59:34,780 --> 04:59:36,260
What the fuck were you doing?

6308
04:59:37,420 --> 04:59:38,260
Oh, you're still a warrior.

6309
04:59:39,860 --> 04:59:41,620
He gets rez'ed by heli kills.

6310
04:59:43,000 --> 04:59:43,700
We should win up here.

6311
04:59:43,860 --> 04:59:45,280
The Ironman is going to be melee range.

6312
04:59:46,440 --> 04:59:48,840
How does the fuck does Ironman have three...

6313
04:59:48,840 --> 04:59:49,460
I'm fucking...

6314
04:59:49,840 --> 04:59:50,720
I don't die to him.

6315
04:59:53,520 --> 04:59:55,440
I am on...

6316
04:59:55,440 --> 04:59:56,780
I lost two... the last game.

6317
04:59:57,940 --> 04:59:59,340
I lost the last game.

6318
05:00:05,420 --> 05:00:07,800
I'm like win-loss-win-loss at the moment.

6319
05:00:08,200 --> 05:00:08,980
It's fucking hell.

6320
05:00:09,520 --> 05:00:10,300
They're portaling.

6321
05:00:11,480 --> 05:00:12,580
I'm going to freeze the first portal.

6322
05:00:13,500 --> 05:00:14,020
Alright.

6323
05:00:14,740 --> 05:00:15,280
Watch this.

6324
05:00:17,140 --> 05:00:18,380
Okay, they're right here.

6325
05:00:18,520 --> 05:00:19,620
What am I supposed to do?

6326
05:00:22,020 --> 05:00:25,140
Oh, that's not where I wanted...

6327
05:00:25,140 --> 05:00:25,680
That's fine.

6328
05:00:25,760 --> 05:00:26,520
This is actually good.

6329
05:00:27,560 --> 05:00:28,720
That was definitely bad.

6330
05:00:32,240 --> 05:00:33,580
Look at my orb on.

6331
05:00:34,500 --> 05:00:35,000
Nice.

6332
05:00:35,000 --> 05:00:36,060
Wait.

6333
05:00:40,200 --> 05:00:41,880
Okay, I'm putting on the Thor.

6334
05:00:41,980 --> 05:00:45,820
The Thor is actually taking so much damage.

6335
05:00:48,200 --> 05:00:49,320
I can't heal from here.

6336
05:00:52,840 --> 05:00:55,200
People from the front are coming in now.

6337
05:00:57,140 --> 05:00:58,180
Ironman is back.

6338
05:01:00,000 --> 05:01:01,220
Oh my god, why?

6339
05:01:01,700 --> 05:01:02,900
Why did you...

6340
05:01:02,900 --> 05:01:03,560
Why did they stuff...

6341
05:01:04,140 --> 05:01:06,120
Why did they stuff the door?

6342
05:01:10,760 --> 05:01:12,220
Oh my god.

6343
05:01:17,670 --> 05:01:20,470
I didn't think they were all going to stuff themselves in the door.

6344
05:01:26,990 --> 05:01:28,030
Oh no.

6345
05:01:31,050 --> 05:01:33,170
I didn't think they would stuff the door there.

6346
05:01:33,170 --> 05:01:34,910
I thought they were going to...

6347
05:01:34,910 --> 05:01:36,370
They were going to come out.

6348
05:01:37,630 --> 05:01:38,350
Where's the Thor?

6349
05:01:41,730 --> 05:01:42,410
Where's the Thor?

6350
05:01:43,570 --> 05:01:44,370
I don't...

6351
05:01:45,250 --> 05:01:46,410
I don't know where the Thor...

6352
05:01:46,410 --> 05:01:47,010
Okay, there's the Thor.

6353
05:01:47,550 --> 05:01:48,410
You get the orb.

6354
05:01:54,450 --> 05:01:55,750
Oh my god, please.

6355
05:01:56,050 --> 05:01:56,970
I'm so close to him.

6356
05:02:01,580 --> 05:02:02,480
Reload my hands.

6357
05:02:03,460 --> 05:02:04,480
Please take more damage.

6358
05:02:05,820 --> 05:02:06,300
Alright.

6359
05:02:10,820 --> 05:02:12,620
Oh fuck, I don't know where that is.

6360
05:02:12,720 --> 05:02:13,880
Oh, we're all okay though.

6361
05:02:15,580 --> 05:02:16,560
Ironman is right here.

6362
05:02:19,400 --> 05:02:21,460
No, I wanted to kill Ironman.

6363
05:02:24,560 --> 05:02:25,680
Oh my god.

6364
05:02:28,420 --> 05:02:30,260
My fucking ult was too long.

6365
05:02:30,560 --> 05:02:32,120
I was going to freeze him.

6366
05:02:32,900 --> 05:02:34,320
Yeah, I got greedy there.

6367
05:02:34,680 --> 05:02:35,640
I think I would have died anyway.

6368
05:02:36,740 --> 05:02:38,840
To be fair, unless I positioned myself way back.

6369
05:02:41,700 --> 05:02:43,380
That was a misplay by my part.

6370
05:02:43,920 --> 05:02:45,720
I was so fucking greedy for the kill.

6371
05:02:46,720 --> 05:02:47,800
I just wanted to freeze him.

6372
05:02:52,220 --> 05:02:54,800
Oh, Liv.

6373
05:02:55,560 --> 05:02:56,560
Oh, Liv.

6374
05:02:57,720 --> 05:02:58,200
Liv.

6375
05:02:59,900 --> 05:03:00,220
Liv.

6376
05:03:03,280 --> 05:03:03,900
Alright.

6377
05:03:05,780 --> 05:03:07,420
Don't have anything for that.

6378
05:03:08,860 --> 05:03:09,980
Goodbye.

6379
05:03:11,720 --> 05:03:13,180
I have to leave.

6380
05:03:14,440 --> 05:03:15,060
Goodbye.

6381
05:03:16,400 --> 05:03:19,620
Alright, I'm locked in now.

6382
05:03:22,200 --> 05:03:23,440
There.

6383
05:03:23,440 --> 05:03:23,480
There.

6384
05:03:25,400 --> 05:03:26,480
That's when you know.

6385
05:03:32,060 --> 05:03:33,020
Punch.

6386
05:03:38,540 --> 05:03:40,680
Oh my god.

6387
05:03:41,220 --> 05:03:42,980
I couldn't get the freeze off.

6388
05:03:47,180 --> 05:03:48,820
No, I hit him.

6389
05:03:54,120 --> 05:03:54,560
Guys.

6390
05:03:54,560 --> 05:03:56,520
They might get off the point.

6391
05:03:56,640 --> 05:03:57,940
Maybe they'll get off the point.

6392
05:03:58,280 --> 05:03:58,720
Who knows.

6393
05:03:59,800 --> 05:04:01,520
It's literally one tick.

6394
05:04:02,520 --> 05:04:04,820
Maybe they'll just get off the point.

6395
05:04:09,240 --> 05:04:10,440
Guys, I don't know.

6396
05:04:10,520 --> 05:04:11,940
I'm not too hopeful anymore.

6397
05:04:12,640 --> 05:04:15,460
I'm not too hopeful anymore, guys.

6398
05:04:16,480 --> 05:04:18,920
This is looking mighty.

6399
05:04:20,640 --> 05:04:22,000
Mighty dreadful.

6400
05:04:25,640 --> 05:04:26,800
Oh, please, please.

6401
05:04:26,940 --> 05:04:27,380
Any heals?

6402
05:04:31,520 --> 05:04:32,520
Okay, yep.

6403
05:04:32,860 --> 05:04:33,420
That's fine.

6404
05:04:34,260 --> 05:04:35,500
There's a Neymar behind us.

6405
05:04:38,060 --> 05:04:39,100
Oh my god.

6406
05:04:39,180 --> 05:04:40,520
Please kill the Neymar behind us.

6407
05:04:45,070 --> 05:04:46,350
Alright, we can...

6408
05:04:47,990 --> 05:04:48,510
Guys.

6409
05:04:49,450 --> 05:04:51,150
I don't know we could push that far.

6410
05:04:57,610 --> 05:04:58,990
Oh my god.

6411
05:04:59,690 --> 05:04:59,870
Oh my god.

6412
05:04:59,870 --> 05:05:00,850
That's gonna be super rough.

6413
05:05:02,250 --> 05:05:05,010
This is gonna be super fucking rough.

6414
05:05:07,690 --> 05:05:09,070
Oh my god.

6415
05:05:09,530 --> 05:05:10,830
Definitely very rough.

6416
05:05:18,100 --> 05:05:19,800
Oh my god.

6417
05:05:19,960 --> 05:05:21,260
Guys, I'm not too hopeful anymore.

6418
05:05:21,720 --> 05:05:23,180
I'm not too hopeful.

6419
05:05:26,140 --> 05:05:29,100
We have to always have ult advantage over them.

6420
05:05:32,640 --> 05:05:34,540
You just always have to have ult advantage.

6421
05:05:35,860 --> 05:05:38,700
I threw the first... I threw the point there.

6422
05:05:39,100 --> 05:05:40,300
I didn't know we were gonna stuff them.

6423
05:05:40,940 --> 05:05:41,760
I was so confused.

6424
05:05:41,840 --> 05:05:43,420
I thought like...

6425
05:05:44,400 --> 05:05:50,180
I was so confused because like I didn't realize they were all gonna stuff them up there and then me... I think... I don't know if Mantis was with them.

6426
05:05:51,040 --> 05:05:54,040
But I didn't know if I should have went down... I should have went down there with them.

6427
05:05:55,440 --> 05:05:57,160
That was my fault there.

6428
05:06:01,860 --> 05:06:03,180
Oh my god.

6429
05:06:03,320 --> 05:06:05,420
Now your Iron Man is fucking doing work.

6430
05:06:05,620 --> 05:06:07,280
Now I can see why they're doing work now.

6431
05:06:12,940 --> 05:06:13,460
Alright.

6432
05:06:14,480 --> 05:06:15,220
Oh man.

6433
05:06:15,400 --> 05:06:17,620
I had my coolest clip too from this game.

6434
05:06:20,400 --> 05:06:22,580
That was such a cool freeze.

6435
05:06:27,820 --> 05:06:29,720
That's why I didn't blow up the building.

6436
05:06:30,600 --> 05:06:33,080
Because we're gonna blow it up ourselves.

6437
05:06:37,560 --> 05:06:39,060
Oh my god!

6438
05:06:42,400 --> 05:06:45,580
How do I heal something that dies that fast?

6439
05:06:46,260 --> 05:06:48,600
I don't even think I had an angle or two for it.

6440
05:06:53,560 --> 05:06:57,040
There we go.

6441
05:06:57,140 --> 05:06:58,120
I'll kill her myself.

6442
05:07:02,260 --> 05:07:03,300
It's fine.

6443
05:07:03,480 --> 05:07:05,880
We killed Mantis so we should move up, right?

6444
05:07:07,560 --> 05:07:10,880
If we kill Mantis then like we can move up, right?

6445
05:07:12,800 --> 05:07:17,720
If I just stay here, everything will be fine.

6446
05:07:18,580 --> 05:07:19,160
I'm just playing point.

6447
05:07:21,180 --> 05:07:22,120
Okay, Namor.

6448
05:07:23,140 --> 05:07:23,700
Okay.

6449
05:07:27,100 --> 05:07:28,440
Okay, Namor.

6450
05:07:29,000 --> 05:07:32,440
That was like full confidence in the fact that I will heal him.

6451
05:07:33,520 --> 05:07:35,960
That was insane confidence right there.

6452
05:07:36,140 --> 05:07:36,720
No, I am.

6453
05:07:39,920 --> 05:07:41,000
Careful with the pulse.

6454
05:07:41,740 --> 05:07:43,440
That was insane fucking confidence.

6455
05:07:48,230 --> 05:07:49,370
Okay.

6456
05:07:53,570 --> 05:07:56,130
I'm a little bit worried though.

6457
05:08:01,770 --> 05:08:03,350
I feel it.

6458
05:08:11,330 --> 05:08:15,430
Yeah, I can win ult this.

6459
05:08:20,930 --> 05:08:21,370
I can win ult this.

6460
05:08:21,370 --> 05:08:23,030
Alright, let's see you all live that.

6461
05:08:23,410 --> 05:08:25,550
I didn't want to take the full impact.

6462
05:08:26,030 --> 05:08:26,830
Wait, did they?

6463
05:08:28,050 --> 05:08:28,490
Okay.

6464
05:08:30,650 --> 05:08:31,530
Oh shit!

6465
05:08:32,330 --> 05:08:33,430
Oh my god.

6466
05:08:34,670 --> 05:08:35,250
I'm dead.

6467
05:08:35,370 --> 05:08:36,190
Wait, I'm not alive.

6468
05:08:41,270 --> 05:08:42,350
Oh, I think he's dead.

6469
05:08:43,350 --> 05:08:44,610
Oh my god, he's dead.

6470
05:08:44,610 --> 05:08:45,190
Okay.

6471
05:08:46,190 --> 05:08:47,310
This is last fight.

6472
05:08:47,430 --> 05:08:50,750
They don't have any support ults.

6473
05:08:54,470 --> 05:08:55,130
Touch it!

6474
05:08:55,210 --> 05:08:55,830
Touch the point!

6475
05:08:57,210 --> 05:08:57,810
Touch it!

6476
05:08:57,910 --> 05:08:58,230
Touch it!

6477
05:08:58,330 --> 05:08:59,010
Oh, nice.

6478
05:09:04,330 --> 05:09:05,170
Is this gonna kill me?

6479
05:09:12,250 --> 05:09:14,110
Where do I go?

6480
05:09:14,870 --> 05:09:16,470
There's nowhere to go.

6481
05:09:18,210 --> 05:09:20,570
I thought he blocked it.

6482
05:09:20,750 --> 05:09:25,090
I thought I had full confidence in my Magneto.

6483
05:09:25,770 --> 05:09:27,170
But, clearly...

6484
05:09:28,930 --> 05:09:30,330
Clearly, I need to stop.

6485
05:09:30,910 --> 05:09:32,290
There's an Ironman behind us.

6486
05:09:32,310 --> 05:09:32,850
I froze him.

6487
05:09:37,500 --> 05:09:38,080
Can we kill?

6488
05:09:38,340 --> 05:09:38,660
Can we kill?

6489
05:09:40,000 --> 05:09:41,920
Never believing again.

6490
05:09:42,300 --> 05:09:43,260
Never.

6491
05:09:44,360 --> 05:09:47,300
Never believing in my teammates again.

6492
05:09:51,080 --> 05:09:53,540
Oh my god.

6493
05:09:53,540 --> 05:09:54,800
That's different.

6494
05:10:06,380 --> 05:10:08,240
I got it.

6495
05:10:08,300 --> 05:10:08,860
I just got it.

6496
05:10:10,900 --> 05:10:12,060
Oh my god.

6497
05:10:13,440 --> 05:10:15,120
Jesus Christ.

6498
05:10:15,640 --> 05:10:19,000
Oh my god.

6499
05:10:19,120 --> 05:10:19,700
It's over.

6500
05:10:19,860 --> 05:10:20,140
It ended.

6501
05:10:25,360 --> 05:10:27,640
I tried to kill Ironman, but he's just so popular.

6502
05:10:28,920 --> 05:10:30,080
He has Ice Cube and everything.

6503
05:10:33,640 --> 05:10:34,680
Jesus Christ.

6504
05:10:37,840 --> 05:10:38,360
Point.

6505
05:10:38,440 --> 05:10:38,640
Point.

6506
05:10:38,700 --> 05:10:39,380
We can't leave point.

6507
05:10:43,360 --> 05:10:45,000
Oh my god.

6508
05:10:49,380 --> 05:10:50,380
Oh my god.

6509
05:10:51,460 --> 05:10:52,500
It's just...

6510
05:10:53,540 --> 05:10:54,740
There's just no way.

6511
05:10:55,020 --> 05:10:56,180
They pushed so far.

6512
05:10:56,260 --> 05:10:58,160
They pushed so far.

6513
05:10:59,240 --> 05:11:01,040
That fucking portal.

6514
05:11:01,440 --> 05:11:03,420
Ironman ult was fucking crazy.

6515
05:11:03,920 --> 05:11:05,060
That actually was crazy.

6516
05:11:05,100 --> 05:11:06,320
That was a close game, though.

6517
05:11:07,600 --> 05:11:08,320
Oh my god.

6518
05:11:08,880 --> 05:11:10,540
They give a Twitch Prime.

6519
05:11:10,680 --> 05:11:11,480
Thank you.

6520
05:11:12,240 --> 05:11:13,160
55k healing?

6521
05:11:13,620 --> 05:11:17,080
I mean, when you have tanks that are fucking in...

6522
05:11:17,080 --> 05:11:18,960
They're like in, in.

6523
05:11:19,420 --> 05:11:21,860
I think most of my deaths were the stupid Ironman ult.

6524
05:11:21,860 --> 05:11:23,220
That was actually so dumb.

6525
05:11:23,380 --> 05:11:25,580
That was actually so dumb.

6526
05:11:28,260 --> 05:11:30,140
Wait, where did he come from?

6527
05:11:30,660 --> 05:11:32,300
How did he get into my game?

6528
05:11:32,500 --> 05:11:34,240
How did you get in?

6529
05:11:34,600 --> 05:11:36,820
You're not even in my friends list.

6530
05:11:39,840 --> 05:11:41,960
I didn't even accept anything.

6531
05:11:42,820 --> 05:11:45,160
How did you get in?

6532
05:11:45,620 --> 05:11:47,260
How did you get in?

6533
05:11:51,860 --> 05:11:53,260
How did he get in?

6534
05:11:54,560 --> 05:11:56,800
He's not even on my friends list.

6535
05:11:56,960 --> 05:11:58,020
I don't understand.

6536
05:12:01,660 --> 05:12:03,120
Alright, that was crazy.

6537
05:12:03,360 --> 05:12:04,760
I don't even know how he got in.

6538
05:12:04,860 --> 05:12:06,900
Alright, let's see how Mende's doing.

6539
05:12:07,100 --> 05:12:08,020
Oh, they lost.

6540
05:12:09,520 --> 05:12:10,240
I'm sorry.

6541
05:12:12,260 --> 05:12:13,320
Oh, thank god.

6542
05:12:13,660 --> 05:12:15,240
There was... He could lose.

6543
05:12:15,760 --> 05:12:18,240
Oh, wait, that means he could lose on my team.

6544
05:12:19,520 --> 05:12:21,040
Oh, he's ready.

6545
05:12:21,560 --> 05:12:23,500
He's bringing the loss streak over.

6546
05:12:23,780 --> 05:12:23,940
True.

6547
05:12:25,960 --> 05:12:26,680
True.

6548
05:12:26,900 --> 05:12:27,420
He is.

6549
05:12:32,530 --> 05:12:33,630
That means...

6550
05:12:33,630 --> 05:12:34,710
Losing is possible.

6551
05:12:36,670 --> 05:12:37,710
I like how he lost...

6552
05:12:37,710 --> 05:12:39,010
And then he swapped over here.

6553
05:12:44,930 --> 05:12:46,090
And like...

6554
05:12:46,090 --> 05:12:47,730
What is this?

6555
05:12:47,730 --> 05:12:49,370
Is this a 3 DPS?

6556
05:12:49,890 --> 05:12:51,510
Wait, is Mace the tank player?

6557
05:12:51,790 --> 05:12:53,330
Oh, Mace is the tank player!

6558
05:12:53,490 --> 05:12:54,570
Okay, I was gonna say.

6559
05:12:54,950 --> 05:12:57,950
This is a 2 DPS with tank trio.

6560
05:12:58,550 --> 05:12:59,350
Very ambitious.

6561
05:12:59,630 --> 05:13:02,730
Because you're expecting your random to go support.

6562
05:13:03,390 --> 05:13:04,810
Your randoms to go support.

6563
05:13:04,990 --> 05:13:10,830
Which they will, because at these hours, these fucking demon hours, are like the support players that are in here.

6564
05:13:11,850 --> 05:13:12,810
Oh my gosh.

6565
05:13:12,810 --> 05:13:14,350
Oh my gosh.

6566
05:13:14,850 --> 05:13:16,450
I need to like, stretch my hands.

6567
05:13:18,230 --> 05:13:19,570
Shooter, thank you for the Twitch Prime!

6568
05:13:19,710 --> 05:13:20,570
Thank you, thank you.

6569
05:13:27,010 --> 05:13:29,110
Alright, one of us has to play support here.

6570
05:13:29,930 --> 05:13:30,930
We don't need tanks.

6571
05:13:31,030 --> 05:13:33,370
No, tanks are the rarest breed of all in any game.

6572
05:13:33,610 --> 05:13:37,470
Because who the fuck wants to go through being a masochist and playing tank?

6573
05:13:38,970 --> 05:13:40,470
Tank is like...

6574
05:13:47,070 --> 05:13:48,850
There's no soul left in my eyes.

6575
05:13:48,970 --> 05:13:49,450
There's none.

6576
05:13:50,270 --> 05:13:56,330
Ever since I started playing Marvel Rivals, there's like, no more hope in them.

6577
05:13:56,590 --> 05:13:57,670
There's no hope.

6578
05:13:58,430 --> 05:13:59,150
As a tank main?

6579
05:13:59,470 --> 05:14:01,590
Yes, because like, I'm banning Psylocke.

6580
05:14:02,650 --> 05:14:03,630
What if I do it?

6581
05:14:04,790 --> 05:14:06,190
What if I fucking do it?

6582
05:14:14,470 --> 05:14:18,710
You're gonna have to put in a difficult vote to get a chance of playing Hulk, man.

6583
05:14:21,190 --> 05:14:21,710
Dopey!

6584
05:14:21,930 --> 05:14:23,210
I saw that, Dopey.

6585
05:14:23,670 --> 05:14:25,210
What the fuck is that?

6586
05:14:26,690 --> 05:14:30,190
You're the strongest fucking dude in the world.

6587
05:14:30,190 --> 05:14:32,910
If I can't play Luna, he can't play Psylocke.

6588
05:14:33,290 --> 05:14:34,530
Hell of a friend, bro.

6589
05:14:34,910 --> 05:14:37,530
Actually, just work it against me over here.

6590
05:14:37,790 --> 05:14:38,750
Fucking hell, man.

6591
05:14:38,750 --> 05:14:41,030
If I can't play Luna, he can't play Psylocke.

6592
05:14:41,110 --> 05:14:42,070
That's how it goes.

6593
05:14:42,070 --> 05:14:45,630
I only play Hulk, so why did you hovel?

6594
05:14:45,950 --> 05:14:46,930
Why did you hover straight?

6595
05:14:50,610 --> 05:14:51,730
Listen, man.

6596
05:14:52,510 --> 05:14:55,470
If you hovered Hulk, we would've we would've known.

6597
05:15:01,130 --> 05:15:04,390
I was banning 10 seconds before?

6598
05:15:05,070 --> 05:15:05,670
It's all good.

6599
05:15:06,190 --> 05:15:08,310
We have no main Saurdash on our team.

6600
05:15:08,950 --> 05:15:10,710
So fucking true, man.

6601
05:15:10,710 --> 05:15:12,610
Wait, don't ban Hulk.

6602
05:15:12,830 --> 05:15:14,310
Dopey, come here.

6603
05:15:14,490 --> 05:15:16,150
Dopey, come here.

6604
05:15:21,770 --> 05:15:23,010
Do it.

6605
05:15:23,590 --> 05:15:23,950
Do a flip.

6606
05:15:24,870 --> 05:15:25,230
Do it.

6607
05:15:29,950 --> 05:15:30,570
Nice.

6608
05:15:31,830 --> 05:15:34,810
This guy gets on my team and starts throwing.

6609
05:15:35,130 --> 05:15:35,430
GG.

6610
05:15:36,010 --> 05:15:36,910
It's over.

6611
05:15:36,910 --> 05:15:37,830
Why the fuck?

6612
05:15:39,910 --> 05:15:42,330
Oh, so that's how people die.

6613
05:15:42,510 --> 05:15:43,290
On the map.

6614
05:15:43,450 --> 05:15:44,170
That makes sense.

6615
05:15:47,230 --> 05:15:49,230
Oh, we're portaling.

6616
05:15:50,590 --> 05:15:52,290
No one said anything.

6617
05:15:56,430 --> 05:15:58,870
No one said anything.

6618
05:15:59,450 --> 05:16:00,570
I was so confused.

6619
05:16:00,570 --> 05:16:02,330
Don't take the portal.

6620
05:16:02,530 --> 05:16:03,270
Just don't take it.

6621
05:16:03,870 --> 05:16:05,470
But we gotta pick.

6622
05:16:08,270 --> 05:16:08,790
Alright.

6623
05:16:09,590 --> 05:16:11,030
This guy wants to run my ones.

6624
05:16:19,770 --> 05:16:21,150
My team okay?

6625
05:16:21,990 --> 05:16:23,110
I can't tell.

6626
05:16:24,810 --> 05:16:26,050
Yeah, we can't walk here.

6627
05:16:26,090 --> 05:16:26,830
We need to walk main.

6628
05:16:28,190 --> 05:16:30,330
Alright, I'm walking main.

6629
05:16:30,930 --> 05:16:32,690
But I'll make sure he's okay first.

6630
05:16:34,170 --> 05:16:35,410
I'll make sure he's okay too.

6631
05:16:35,650 --> 05:16:36,450
And I'm gonna give...

6632
05:16:36,450 --> 05:16:38,150
Oh my god!

6633
05:16:38,630 --> 05:16:40,390
I don't think he's gonna be okay.

6634
05:16:41,010 --> 05:16:42,910
Is he okay?

6635
05:16:43,770 --> 05:16:44,550
He's okay.

6636
05:16:45,730 --> 05:16:46,850
Jesus Christ.

6637
05:16:50,130 --> 05:16:50,690
Please.

6638
05:16:51,250 --> 05:16:53,450
This is very stressful to keep up.

6639
05:16:55,970 --> 05:16:57,750
Oh my god, I got my headshots in.

6640
05:16:58,010 --> 05:16:58,410
Dope.

6641
05:16:58,930 --> 05:17:00,430
I don't know if I can get another one in.

6642
05:17:00,430 --> 05:17:02,370
Dude, holy shit.

6643
05:17:02,930 --> 05:17:04,470
Everybody is okay.

6644
05:17:05,410 --> 05:17:07,730
That is like very scary to walk up to.

6645
05:17:07,810 --> 05:17:08,630
Not gonna lie.

6646
05:17:10,610 --> 05:17:11,130
That's...

6647
05:17:14,860 --> 05:17:16,180
Okay, I slept him.

6648
05:17:18,000 --> 05:17:19,880
Can't be that difficult to kill these guys, right?

6649
05:17:20,120 --> 05:17:20,960
It was.

6650
05:17:25,770 --> 05:17:26,290
Whoa!

6651
05:17:27,270 --> 05:17:28,090
I'm fine.

6652
05:17:28,290 --> 05:17:28,930
I have ult here.

6653
05:17:32,890 --> 05:17:33,950
We didn't do anything?

6654
05:17:33,950 --> 05:17:35,190
I'll just stay here.

6655
05:17:37,230 --> 05:17:41,350
I don't know if my team is okay, but like...

6656
05:17:43,130 --> 05:17:43,770
Okay.

6657
05:17:45,570 --> 05:17:47,430
Isn't it great that...

6658
05:17:47,430 --> 05:17:49,070
Oh my god, this is not good.

6659
05:17:50,370 --> 05:17:51,250
This is not great.

6660
05:17:52,250 --> 05:17:53,350
This is not great.

6661
05:17:58,550 --> 05:18:00,630
I'm trying, buddy.

6662
05:18:01,530 --> 05:18:04,170
I am trying my best.

6663
05:18:07,590 --> 05:18:08,070
Alright.

6664
05:18:09,150 --> 05:18:10,750
Oh my god.

6665
05:18:11,590 --> 05:18:12,010
I'm ulting.

6666
05:18:15,770 --> 05:18:17,130
Break it, break it, break it, break it.

6667
05:18:17,310 --> 05:18:17,650
No!

6668
05:18:20,330 --> 05:18:22,250
Alright, I thought he would break it before.

6669
05:18:22,810 --> 05:18:25,370
I had so much confidence that he would.

6670
05:18:25,670 --> 05:18:26,970
I heard, break it.

6671
05:18:27,030 --> 05:18:28,410
And I was like, he's gonna break it.

6672
05:18:28,410 --> 05:18:29,910
There's no way.

6673
05:18:30,070 --> 05:18:32,770
He's gonna definitely break it.

6674
05:18:35,030 --> 05:18:37,130
He wouldn't fuck that up.

6675
05:18:40,790 --> 05:18:41,030
What?

6676
05:18:42,730 --> 05:18:43,350
Ruben!

6677
05:18:44,030 --> 05:18:45,950
Ruben, I need to sleep!

6678
05:18:48,790 --> 05:18:49,670
Guys.

6679
05:18:50,110 --> 05:18:51,910
I'm gonna freak out.

6680
05:18:51,910 --> 05:18:52,850
I'm gonna...

6681
05:18:54,710 --> 05:18:56,070
I'm gonna...

6682
05:18:56,070 --> 05:18:57,630
Ruben, this is...

6683
05:18:57,630 --> 05:18:59,790
I'm at the edge right here.

6684
05:19:00,090 --> 05:19:02,010
I will take the jump, Ruben.

6685
05:19:06,590 --> 05:19:08,630
I will take the jump.

6686
05:19:14,770 --> 05:19:15,450
Nice.

6687
05:19:20,170 --> 05:19:20,850
What?

6688
05:19:23,310 --> 05:19:26,190
Oh my god.

6689
05:19:29,450 --> 05:19:32,770
Bro, what the fuck is going on?

6690
05:19:33,170 --> 05:19:33,530
What?

6691
05:19:35,850 --> 05:19:36,910
Bro.

6692
05:19:44,750 --> 05:19:45,810
Bro.

6693
05:19:46,650 --> 05:19:48,470
Wait, is Mason Overwatch there?

6694
05:19:50,030 --> 05:19:53,430
I love these.

6695
05:19:55,670 --> 05:19:56,450
Damn.

6696
05:19:56,450 --> 05:19:58,610
That's Ashley fucked.

6697
05:20:00,270 --> 05:20:02,010
You're so healthy.

6698
05:20:05,910 --> 05:20:06,990
There we go.

6699
05:20:07,210 --> 05:20:07,650
What?

6700
05:20:07,790 --> 05:20:08,750
That doesn't hit?

6701
05:20:09,230 --> 05:20:11,150
Are you serious?

6702
05:20:11,790 --> 05:20:13,670
Guys, type shit, type shit.

6703
05:20:16,030 --> 05:20:17,230
That's fine.

6704
05:20:17,470 --> 05:20:19,090
We're so healthy right here.

6705
05:20:20,010 --> 05:20:22,350
You're so healthy, let's go.

6706
05:20:25,960 --> 05:20:27,640
They're portaling, they're portaling, I think.

6707
05:20:28,220 --> 05:20:29,420
That's so healthy.

6708
05:20:31,500 --> 05:20:32,520
Where's the portal?

6709
05:20:32,700 --> 05:20:33,400
Oh, it's up top.

6710
05:20:33,620 --> 05:20:34,460
Okay, I was gonna say.

6711
05:20:39,830 --> 05:20:41,510
That's actually crazy.

6712
05:20:41,750 --> 05:20:43,730
How he's like, damn, you missed those?

6713
05:20:44,390 --> 05:20:47,350
What a crazy thing this ADC makes.

6714
05:20:48,990 --> 05:20:49,910
Jesus Christ.

6715
05:20:50,630 --> 05:20:51,430
I'm alive.

6716
05:20:53,910 --> 05:20:54,930
I can't get hit.

6717
05:20:54,930 --> 05:20:56,150
I cannot peek for this.

6718
05:20:58,950 --> 05:21:01,090
I would love to peek right now.

6719
05:21:03,590 --> 05:21:04,690
Who woke him?

6720
05:21:05,450 --> 05:21:06,670
I literally saw him.

6721
05:21:06,770 --> 05:21:08,810
Oh my god, I saw him sleep for like one second.

6722
05:21:09,070 --> 05:21:12,150
I saw him sleep for one second.

6723
05:21:12,910 --> 05:21:14,870
What happened?

6724
05:21:19,070 --> 05:21:19,590
What?

6725
05:21:20,510 --> 05:21:21,270
What?

6726
05:21:22,230 --> 05:21:23,450
What did I hear?

6727
05:21:23,970 --> 05:21:24,850
Oh shit!

6728
05:21:28,090 --> 05:21:28,930
There you go.

6729
05:21:29,490 --> 05:21:30,890
Everything is fine.

6730
05:21:35,550 --> 05:21:36,930
Everything is fine.

6731
05:21:38,650 --> 05:21:39,510
I don't even...

6732
05:21:39,510 --> 05:21:41,390
Where's my DPS to damage boost?

6733
05:21:43,530 --> 05:21:45,130
Where are they?

6734
05:21:48,450 --> 05:21:50,010
Oh, that's where they are.

6735
05:21:52,630 --> 05:21:53,430
Alright.

6736
05:21:55,890 --> 05:21:57,210
That's where I die.

6737
05:21:58,110 --> 05:21:58,910
Welp.

6738
05:22:02,150 --> 05:22:03,590
Welp, are we touching?

6739
05:22:04,370 --> 05:22:08,170
Alright, I spawn in here then.

6740
05:22:10,590 --> 05:22:10,970
Alright.

6741
05:22:11,890 --> 05:22:12,490
Oh!

6742
05:22:14,770 --> 05:22:17,730
I saw him space, so I got scared.

6743
05:22:18,430 --> 05:22:19,230
That's fine.

6744
05:22:19,310 --> 05:22:20,010
We got born again.

6745
05:22:20,850 --> 05:22:22,650
I can't see anybody.

6746
05:22:23,690 --> 05:22:25,110
Alright, that's fine.

6747
05:22:27,510 --> 05:22:28,890
I'm a little bit scared though.

6748
05:22:29,990 --> 05:22:32,030
I'm very scared actually.

6749
05:22:38,110 --> 05:22:40,030
I'm a little scared.

6750
05:22:40,170 --> 05:22:40,890
I'm very scared.

6751
05:22:45,060 --> 05:22:45,700
Oh!

6752
05:22:45,700 --> 05:22:45,960
Oh!

6753
05:22:49,380 --> 05:22:49,820
Oh!

6754
05:22:51,340 --> 05:22:53,620
Oh, I'm alive somehow!

6755
05:22:55,680 --> 05:22:56,560
Nevermind.

6756
05:22:57,580 --> 05:22:58,460
Nevermind.

6757
05:23:00,360 --> 05:23:02,040
Oh my god.

6758
05:23:05,680 --> 05:23:07,440
I don't...

6759
05:23:07,440 --> 05:23:08,880
We were not very much alive.

6760
05:23:10,380 --> 05:23:13,600
We were not very much alive.

6761
05:23:16,900 --> 05:23:18,260
Oh my god.

6762
05:23:33,350 --> 05:23:35,190
Yeah, I was alive though.

6763
05:23:35,350 --> 05:23:36,350
For like one second.

6764
05:23:38,750 --> 05:23:39,790
For like...

6765
05:23:39,790 --> 05:23:41,570
One second there.

6766
05:23:41,950 --> 05:23:42,570
That was nice.

6767
05:23:42,630 --> 05:23:43,510
That was a nice feeling.

6768
05:23:43,890 --> 05:23:45,010
I had a great time.

6769
05:23:49,270 --> 05:23:50,210
It truly was.

6770
05:23:50,890 --> 05:23:52,010
A great time.

6771
05:23:52,230 --> 05:23:53,510
Being alive there for a bit.

6772
05:23:56,550 --> 05:23:58,310
Things will be okay, right guys?

6773
05:24:00,910 --> 05:24:01,990
Things will be okay, right?

6774
05:24:09,950 --> 05:24:12,370
Things will be okay, right guys?

6775
05:24:13,250 --> 05:24:13,590
Right?

6776
05:24:15,090 --> 05:24:17,070
I'm not stopping till eternity.

6777
05:24:18,310 --> 05:24:21,250
We're in for the long haul today.

6778
05:24:23,010 --> 05:24:24,210
Okay, I'll lock in.

6779
05:24:25,430 --> 05:24:25,970
I'll lock in.

6780
05:24:25,970 --> 05:24:26,170
Portal?

6781
05:24:26,170 --> 05:24:27,030
Portal, portal, portal.

6782
05:24:27,820 --> 05:24:28,210
Portal?

6783
05:24:29,290 --> 05:24:30,170
Where's portal?

6784
05:24:31,690 --> 05:24:32,590
Where's portal?

6785
05:24:34,570 --> 05:24:35,270
I'm waiting.

6786
05:24:36,670 --> 05:24:41,130
We're all waiting?

6787
05:24:52,770 --> 05:24:53,480
We're fine.

6788
05:24:58,120 --> 05:25:00,060
Okay, I'm fucking dropping down.

6789
05:25:00,060 --> 05:25:01,280
We're not fine anymore.

6790
05:25:04,420 --> 05:25:05,860
I'm not staying up.

6791
05:25:06,020 --> 05:25:07,820
Oh my god.

6792
05:25:11,780 --> 05:25:13,160
Like, I'm support.

6793
05:25:13,280 --> 05:25:14,460
What do you want me to do?

6794
05:25:20,080 --> 05:25:22,240
I don't want to get pushed there.

6795
05:25:27,890 --> 05:25:29,250
Oh my god.

6796
05:25:29,250 --> 05:25:31,290
I was gonna stand there.

6797
05:25:31,430 --> 05:25:33,350
I needed other people there with me.

6798
05:25:37,370 --> 05:25:40,850
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

6799
05:25:46,680 --> 05:25:48,840
Like, I don't mind if other people went up.

6800
05:25:49,320 --> 05:25:50,040
But not me.

6801
05:25:50,580 --> 05:25:51,720
I'm just a little guy.

6802
05:25:57,240 --> 05:25:57,760
Goodbye.

6803
05:25:59,580 --> 05:26:00,100
Goodbye.

6804
05:26:00,180 --> 05:26:02,620
I used all the leaves I could.

6805
05:26:02,620 --> 05:26:03,640
In that scenario.

6806
05:26:04,040 --> 05:26:06,120
I actually tried my best.

6807
05:26:08,460 --> 05:26:10,700
Jesus, I don't have enough leaves.

6808
05:26:12,120 --> 05:26:14,080
I don't have...

6809
05:26:17,200 --> 05:26:19,600
I don't have enough leaves.

6810
05:26:22,680 --> 05:26:23,760
It's fine.

6811
05:26:23,940 --> 05:26:25,060
Everything will be fine.

6812
05:26:32,100 --> 05:26:34,440
Jesus, you all take so much damage.

6813
05:26:35,420 --> 05:26:37,360
All right, we got...

6814
05:26:37,360 --> 05:26:38,820
We gotta use this.

6815
05:26:43,810 --> 05:26:44,970
All right.

6816
05:26:45,390 --> 05:26:46,370
Go do your thing.

6817
05:26:46,830 --> 05:26:47,630
Guys.

6818
05:26:48,710 --> 05:26:50,170
We have Punisher.

6819
05:26:51,430 --> 05:26:52,830
We have Punisher.

6820
05:26:53,830 --> 05:26:55,490
We don't have tanks.

6821
05:26:55,650 --> 05:26:56,710
Oh my god.

6822
05:26:58,370 --> 05:26:59,990
Holy shit.

6823
05:27:00,970 --> 05:27:01,510
Oh my god.

6824
05:27:01,750 --> 05:27:05,110
No, he fucking bumbled it.

6825
05:27:07,630 --> 05:27:09,590
Oh my god.

6826
05:27:09,590 --> 05:27:11,410
I was ready to sleep it.

6827
05:27:12,330 --> 05:27:14,870
It got fucking bumbled.

6828
05:27:16,730 --> 05:27:19,150
Oh my god, is it actually?

6829
05:27:20,530 --> 05:27:21,570
Let's go.

6830
05:27:22,190 --> 05:27:23,330
Where am I?

6831
05:27:24,110 --> 05:27:24,990
Oh, I'm over here.

6832
05:27:25,710 --> 05:27:26,110
All right.

6833
05:27:33,120 --> 05:27:34,500
All right, it's fine.

6834
05:27:36,620 --> 05:27:38,860
Oh my god, it's not fine.

6835
05:27:40,260 --> 05:27:42,160
It's not fine.

6836
05:27:42,240 --> 05:27:42,460
It's not fine.

6837
05:27:42,460 --> 05:27:45,080
This is scary as fuck right now.

6838
05:27:47,300 --> 05:27:48,020
Jesus.

6839
05:27:48,480 --> 05:27:49,880
Jesus Christ.

6840
05:27:50,040 --> 05:27:52,880
I hope it's damaged right now.

6841
05:27:53,460 --> 05:27:53,860
All right.

6842
05:27:56,860 --> 05:27:57,580
Oh.

6843
05:27:57,700 --> 05:27:59,120
I hear somebody.

6844
05:28:02,950 --> 05:28:03,470
All right.

6845
05:28:04,890 --> 05:28:05,450
All right.

6846
05:28:05,450 --> 05:28:05,710
All right.

6847
05:28:09,970 --> 05:28:11,750
Oh, Neymar, let's go.

6848
05:28:14,070 --> 05:28:15,570
All right, let's all be together.

6849
05:28:20,710 --> 05:28:22,030
I'm scared of that.

6850
05:28:24,350 --> 05:28:25,950
Is everybody okay?

6851
05:28:26,390 --> 05:28:27,750
I don't think everybody...

6852
05:28:27,750 --> 05:28:27,990
No.

6853
05:28:28,810 --> 05:28:29,450
No.

6854
05:28:30,710 --> 05:28:31,350
No.

6855
05:28:32,850 --> 05:28:34,770
I don't know about this, guys.

6856
05:28:35,250 --> 05:28:40,430
I don't know about this.

6857
05:28:46,350 --> 05:28:46,990
Well...

6858
05:28:46,990 --> 05:28:48,510
I'm back in GM2.

6859
05:28:57,550 --> 05:28:59,150
Oh my god.

6860
05:28:59,450 --> 05:29:01,210
I'm back in GM2.

6861
05:29:01,630 --> 05:29:02,990
Oh my god.

6862
05:29:03,530 --> 05:29:04,530
I can do this.

6863
05:29:05,370 --> 05:29:06,590
Just a little setback.

6864
05:29:07,870 --> 05:29:09,650
This is just a little setback.

6865
05:29:10,450 --> 05:29:12,590
Fucking hell, this is just...

6866
05:29:12,590 --> 05:29:14,470
Just a little setback.

6867
05:29:29,400 --> 05:29:30,140
All right.

6868
05:29:59,930 --> 05:30:01,170
All right, here we go.

6869
05:30:02,270 --> 05:30:04,790
I'm like up, down, up, down, up, down.

6870
05:30:04,990 --> 05:30:06,730
I'm on an unlucky streak right now.

6871
05:30:20,340 --> 05:30:21,300
All right.

6872
05:30:22,080 --> 05:30:24,800
Up, down, up, down, up, down.

6873
05:30:28,190 --> 05:30:29,130
Oh my god.

6874
05:30:29,130 --> 05:30:29,970
Oh my god.

6875
05:30:48,370 --> 05:30:48,850
All right.

6876
05:30:49,410 --> 05:30:50,750
The ride never ends.

6877
05:30:51,250 --> 05:30:54,570
Sorry, I had work messages because like...

6878
05:30:55,550 --> 05:31:00,650
I had to respond to some messages here.

6879
05:31:04,370 --> 05:31:08,470
I think the fucking craziest shit was...

6880
05:31:09,330 --> 05:31:11,270
Was whoever that guy...

6881
05:31:11,270 --> 05:31:12,990
That was like...

6882
05:31:12,990 --> 05:31:15,210
Whoever that guy was like, wow, Mace, you missed those?

6883
05:31:15,210 --> 05:31:16,230
That shit was crazy.

6884
05:31:16,650 --> 05:31:19,910
That was a fucking crazy comment.

6885
05:31:23,970 --> 05:31:24,790
In my game.

6886
05:31:46,940 --> 05:31:48,040
Nice way to death.

6887
05:31:48,100 --> 05:31:49,460
No, don't say that.

6888
05:31:49,620 --> 05:31:52,480
Please, don't say that.

6889
05:31:53,080 --> 05:31:54,020
Don't say that.

6890
05:31:54,160 --> 05:31:56,180
I don't do subathons.

6891
05:31:56,360 --> 05:31:57,280
I just stream.

6892
05:31:57,780 --> 05:31:59,840
I don't need to do subathons.

6893
05:32:00,400 --> 05:32:03,840
I make it enough to be okay without having to do a subathon.

6894
05:32:05,040 --> 05:32:06,760
I don't know how I still...

6895
05:32:06,760 --> 05:32:07,500
Oh, hey, Zac guy.

6896
05:32:07,600 --> 05:32:09,060
I don't know how I still have the energy.

6897
05:32:09,720 --> 05:32:10,100
I don't know.

6898
05:32:10,180 --> 05:32:12,260
Playing competitive games always makes me so hyper.

6899
05:32:13,340 --> 05:32:14,340
I just get like...

6900
05:32:14,340 --> 05:32:16,600
Adrenaline from competitive in general.

6901
05:32:19,800 --> 05:32:20,560
It's a rankathon.

6902
05:32:20,820 --> 05:32:21,700
No, 100%.

6903
05:32:21,700 --> 05:32:22,560
It's a rankathon.

6904
05:32:22,860 --> 05:32:23,500
Oh, hey.

6905
05:32:23,840 --> 05:32:28,660
We have a Hulk there?

6906
05:32:54,000 --> 05:32:54,720
All right.

6907
05:32:54,720 --> 05:32:56,640
You guys got...

6908
05:32:56,640 --> 05:32:57,900
We're not banning Hulk.

6909
05:33:05,770 --> 05:33:07,550
What a time, boys.

6910
05:33:07,710 --> 05:33:09,770
Do we have a Hawkeye player?

6911
05:33:12,530 --> 05:33:13,670
We don't need a...

6912
05:33:13,670 --> 05:33:15,950
Our Iron Fist can deal with a Hawkeye player.

6913
05:33:17,050 --> 05:33:21,450
I mean, I assume you two just dive him so hard that...

6914
05:33:21,450 --> 05:33:22,750
Yeah, exactly.

6915
05:33:22,990 --> 05:33:24,210
We have two divers.

6916
05:33:24,210 --> 05:33:26,170
How many games I do rank to GM2?

6917
05:33:26,570 --> 05:33:27,010
So...

6918
05:33:27,010 --> 05:33:29,550
I literally just do rank to GM2.

6919
05:33:29,650 --> 05:33:30,890
You can just do rank to GM2.

6920
05:33:33,550 --> 05:33:35,410
Like, what are we playing, man?

6921
05:33:36,290 --> 05:33:38,270
Dude, we'll figure it out.

6922
05:33:40,830 --> 05:33:41,650
I mean, I can go...

6923
05:33:41,650 --> 05:33:42,590
I can go Penny.

6924
05:33:42,810 --> 05:33:47,130
Oh my god.

6925
05:33:47,790 --> 05:33:48,630
This is it.

6926
05:33:52,610 --> 05:33:53,570
This is it.

6927
05:33:54,130 --> 05:33:54,590
This is it.

6928
05:33:54,590 --> 05:33:57,350
It's gonna be a-okay, everybody.

6929
05:33:59,250 --> 05:34:00,230
Oh yeah, by the way, I asked this.

6930
05:34:00,230 --> 05:34:00,790
Who is Mace?

6931
05:34:01,770 --> 05:34:03,210
Is he an Overwatch player?

6932
05:34:04,230 --> 05:34:04,690
Who is Mace?

6933
05:34:05,270 --> 05:34:06,350
I know he has a partner.

6934
05:34:07,730 --> 05:34:09,850
I just know he's rank 1 and he was rank...

6935
05:34:09,850 --> 05:34:14,250
He is or was rank 1 in Marvel Rivals?

6936
05:34:15,130 --> 05:34:16,430
What game did he come from?

6937
05:34:21,710 --> 05:34:22,150
Okay.

6938
05:34:22,890 --> 05:34:23,930
Oh, TP.

6939
05:34:25,190 --> 05:34:26,830
Goodbye, my flankers.

6940
05:34:28,610 --> 05:34:29,810
No, not MaceTheFace.

6941
05:34:29,930 --> 05:34:31,330
He's not MaceTheFace.

6942
05:34:32,250 --> 05:34:33,950
I know MaceTheFace, boys.

6943
05:34:36,450 --> 05:34:37,530
Oh, hey, they have it.

6944
05:34:41,650 --> 05:34:42,750
Oh, he's a top 10?

6945
05:34:42,850 --> 05:34:44,110
Oh, that's why he's a team player.

6946
05:34:45,810 --> 05:34:46,230
Yeah.

6947
05:34:46,650 --> 05:34:47,110
Makes sense.

6948
05:34:51,930 --> 05:34:53,130
That's fucking right.

6949
05:34:53,750 --> 05:34:55,790
I can aim.

6950
05:34:56,210 --> 05:34:56,890
Let's go.

6951
05:35:00,190 --> 05:35:01,290
Yeah, beat her up.

6952
05:35:02,610 --> 05:35:04,150
Beat her up.

6953
05:35:04,650 --> 05:35:06,110
Oh, I don't...

6954
05:35:06,910 --> 05:35:08,590
Oh my god, he beat her up.

6955
05:35:09,770 --> 05:35:11,610
He actually...

6956
05:35:11,610 --> 05:35:13,170
Oh.

6957
05:35:14,370 --> 05:35:16,230
Oh, he's coming over.

6958
05:35:16,390 --> 05:35:17,690
Wait, we can kill Strange.

6959
05:35:20,510 --> 05:35:21,590
Never mind.

6960
05:35:21,670 --> 05:35:22,610
We cannot kill Strange.

6961
05:35:24,670 --> 05:35:25,930
Never mind.

6962
05:35:27,470 --> 05:35:29,070
Oh my god.

6963
05:35:29,450 --> 05:35:30,710
You're so healthy.

6964
05:35:32,310 --> 05:35:33,530
You're not healthy.

6965
05:35:36,590 --> 05:35:37,790
He's not.

6966
05:35:38,410 --> 05:35:39,610
Bro, how?

6967
05:35:39,610 --> 05:35:41,710
Oh my god, punch him!

6968
05:35:42,170 --> 05:35:42,790
Oh, he's dead.

6969
05:35:47,890 --> 05:35:51,090
That Hawkeye is hitting all his shots.

6970
05:35:51,210 --> 05:35:51,790
That's for sure.

6971
05:35:54,770 --> 05:35:56,210
I'm so scared.

6972
05:36:00,610 --> 05:36:01,810
It's so fun.

6973
05:36:01,950 --> 05:36:02,930
It's so okay.

6974
05:36:05,910 --> 05:36:07,910
Guys, it's so okay.

6975
05:36:08,470 --> 05:36:09,210
I just...

6976
05:36:09,210 --> 05:36:13,810
As long as I never let go of left click, everybody will be okay.

6977
05:36:15,050 --> 05:36:16,710
Am I... Is it okay?

6978
05:36:16,970 --> 05:36:17,450
Oh, okay.

6979
05:36:18,150 --> 05:36:18,970
You know what?

6980
05:36:19,010 --> 05:36:20,110
I believe in my Luna.

6981
05:36:23,390 --> 05:36:25,510
There's a Frozen Psylocke here.

6982
05:36:28,350 --> 05:36:29,730
That's right!

6983
05:36:29,950 --> 05:36:31,910
Now I'll dance!

6984
05:36:35,190 --> 05:36:36,690
That's right!

6985
05:36:37,710 --> 05:36:39,870
Oh my god.

6986
05:36:39,870 --> 05:36:42,270
I'm fucking...

6987
05:36:42,270 --> 05:36:42,730
Storm's one.

6988
05:36:42,830 --> 05:36:43,230
Storm's one.

6989
05:36:44,990 --> 05:36:45,770
Oh, I died.

6990
05:36:46,250 --> 05:36:46,910
I did.

6991
05:36:51,030 --> 05:36:52,470
Jesus Christ.

6992
05:36:53,170 --> 05:36:53,610
It's fine.

6993
05:36:53,670 --> 05:36:54,810
My existence don't matter.

6994
05:36:55,410 --> 05:36:57,090
The team wins anyway.

6995
05:36:57,730 --> 05:36:58,710
I got my...

6996
05:36:58,710 --> 05:37:00,550
I got my Storm kill.

6997
05:37:04,970 --> 05:37:06,290
I got...

6998
05:37:13,250 --> 05:37:13,870
Alright.

6999
05:37:16,750 --> 05:37:18,030
Is everything fine?

7000
05:37:18,550 --> 05:37:19,430
Is everything okay?

7001
05:37:20,610 --> 05:37:22,010
Everything will be okay, right?

7002
05:37:23,570 --> 05:37:25,350
I believe in our Iron Fist.

7003
05:37:26,530 --> 05:37:27,230
Storm's one.

7004
05:37:29,230 --> 05:37:30,850
Who the fuck is healing Storm?

7005
05:37:30,950 --> 05:37:31,430
Not anymore.

7006
05:37:37,050 --> 05:37:38,370
Oh my god, please.

7007
05:37:40,890 --> 05:37:41,790
That's fine.

7008
05:37:41,790 --> 05:37:41,930
That's fine.

7009
05:37:42,630 --> 05:37:43,810
This guy's low too.

7010
05:37:45,090 --> 05:37:46,370
I can only dance so much.

7011
05:37:46,450 --> 05:37:47,010
I know, right?

7012
05:37:51,000 --> 05:37:53,720
I can only dance so much.

7013
05:37:59,940 --> 05:38:00,740
Who's on the point?

7014
05:38:01,020 --> 05:38:02,060
Oh, sorry.

7015
05:38:02,800 --> 05:38:03,900
Okay, our Iron Fist.

7016
05:38:04,420 --> 05:38:05,920
I had a double take.

7017
05:38:06,000 --> 05:38:07,260
I was like, who the fuck is that?

7018
05:38:07,700 --> 05:38:08,200
Who is he?

7019
05:38:09,280 --> 05:38:10,240
I was like, wait.

7020
05:38:11,020 --> 05:38:12,120
He's on the point?

7021
05:38:12,120 --> 05:38:13,400
He's on the point?

7022
05:38:14,880 --> 05:38:17,460
I don't know who I froze, but like, good luck.

7023
05:38:25,050 --> 05:38:26,090
That's fine.

7024
05:38:26,170 --> 05:38:27,490
Everybody is so healthy.

7025
05:38:32,890 --> 05:38:33,650
Hey!

7026
05:38:33,970 --> 05:38:34,770
Let's go!

7027
05:38:35,290 --> 05:38:36,130
They're dancing!

7028
05:38:37,170 --> 05:38:38,530
I'm dancing too!

7029
05:38:38,990 --> 05:38:40,070
Let's go!

7030
05:38:41,230 --> 05:38:42,630
Come on, everybody!

7031
05:38:44,670 --> 05:38:45,430
Slay.

7032
05:38:45,830 --> 05:38:47,830
Oh my god, oh my god!

7033
05:38:47,830 --> 05:38:49,670
I forgot Hawkeye can kill through this.

7034
05:38:49,810 --> 05:38:50,010
I...

7035
05:38:52,270 --> 05:38:52,830
Oh!

7036
05:38:53,110 --> 05:38:54,210
They Star Vaulted!

7037
05:38:55,710 --> 05:38:59,010
I haven't played against a Hawkeye in so long.

7038
05:38:59,410 --> 05:39:00,850
And then I almost died.

7039
05:39:00,970 --> 05:39:02,850
I was like, I gotta get out of here.

7040
05:39:03,970 --> 05:39:04,670
Got it.

7041
05:39:07,010 --> 05:39:08,350
I forgot about that.

7042
05:39:08,590 --> 05:39:09,890
I had to run away.

7043
05:39:11,270 --> 05:39:14,210
It's been so long since I played against a Hawkeye.

7044
05:39:14,750 --> 05:39:15,630
He can...

7045
05:39:15,630 --> 05:39:17,190
For those who don't know, he can actually...

7046
05:39:17,190 --> 05:39:19,170
He can kill through...

7047
05:39:19,970 --> 05:39:21,150
Oh my god!

7048
05:39:21,370 --> 05:39:22,790
He can kill through any support ult.

7049
05:39:23,330 --> 05:39:24,010
Doesn't matter.

7050
05:39:24,230 --> 05:39:25,890
He can even kill you through a support ult.

7051
05:39:31,490 --> 05:39:33,830
Yeah, but some people don't know.

7052
05:39:33,890 --> 05:39:35,350
Some people think they're so super.

7053
05:39:35,450 --> 05:39:36,950
They think like...

7054
05:39:38,350 --> 05:39:40,490
They think that...

7055
05:39:44,270 --> 05:39:46,710
Luna and Mantis ult is invincibility.

7056
05:39:47,090 --> 05:39:47,850
But it's not.

7057
05:39:48,910 --> 05:39:49,950
So like...

7058
05:39:49,950 --> 05:39:51,150
I learned that the hard way.

7059
05:39:51,850 --> 05:39:55,330
You know, when I danced in front of a fucking Hawkeye and got headshotted.

7060
05:39:59,410 --> 05:40:02,350
No, he can literally headshot you through a Luna ult.

7061
05:40:02,610 --> 05:40:06,830
He can headshot the Luna specifically.

7062
05:40:15,130 --> 05:40:17,990
So I danced in front of a Hawkeye and I was like, oh!

7063
05:40:18,850 --> 05:40:19,150
Wow.

7064
05:40:20,210 --> 05:40:21,270
He did not like that.

7065
05:40:22,230 --> 05:40:23,270
I was like...

7066
05:40:23,270 --> 05:40:25,850
Because I was trying to be cocky and bodyblock his ult.

7067
05:40:33,990 --> 05:40:36,050
Bro, Garf beat the shit out of people.

7068
05:40:36,230 --> 05:40:37,970
It was crazy watching that happen.

7069
05:40:44,490 --> 05:40:46,570
Yeah, they ban the same people.

7070
05:40:46,690 --> 05:40:47,450
At least we don't have Hella.

7071
05:40:48,310 --> 05:40:49,230
That's great.

7072
05:40:52,050 --> 05:40:53,030
Do I have MVP?

7073
05:40:53,550 --> 05:40:54,710
Oh shit, I do.

7074
05:40:57,110 --> 05:40:58,210
I didn't even notice.

7075
05:41:01,250 --> 05:41:02,910
Alright, you know what?

7076
05:41:03,030 --> 05:41:03,990
Garf deserves this.

7077
05:41:04,550 --> 05:41:05,690
Oh shit guys, I'm Ace.

7078
05:41:06,250 --> 05:41:07,590
I'm not even focused at a...

7079
05:41:07,590 --> 05:41:08,510
Okay, I should focus up.

7080
05:41:09,470 --> 05:41:10,610
I should focus up.

7081
05:41:14,710 --> 05:41:17,110
I froze somebody and I wasn't paying attention.

7082
05:41:17,410 --> 05:41:18,910
I literally looked away.

7083
05:41:20,330 --> 05:41:22,710
Like the whole cool guys don't look at explosions.

7084
05:41:24,090 --> 05:41:26,270
Oh, they're dooming now.

7085
05:41:27,210 --> 05:41:27,630
They're running.

7086
05:41:28,550 --> 05:41:28,770
Oh!

7087
05:41:33,220 --> 05:41:35,660
Poke me like one time.

7088
05:41:36,460 --> 05:41:38,160
Oh my god.

7089
05:41:42,330 --> 05:41:43,730
Oh my god.

7090
05:41:48,270 --> 05:41:49,430
Skip tech, skip tech.

7091
05:41:49,570 --> 05:41:49,830
It's fine.

7092
05:41:55,710 --> 05:41:56,490
It's fine.

7093
05:42:01,050 --> 05:42:02,190
I'll keep Mace up.

7094
05:42:02,450 --> 05:42:03,710
He's rigged one for a reason.

7095
05:42:05,770 --> 05:42:06,790
Who cares?

7096
05:42:06,990 --> 05:42:07,970
He's rigged one.

7097
05:42:10,290 --> 05:42:12,330
At least she's literally one.

7098
05:42:13,130 --> 05:42:15,290
Oh my god, I almost killed her.

7099
05:42:16,730 --> 05:42:18,010
Oh my god.

7100
05:42:18,030 --> 05:42:19,190
Oh my god, was I not healed?

7101
05:42:19,370 --> 05:42:20,150
You have no healers?

7102
05:42:26,150 --> 05:42:28,330
Oh my god, okay.

7103
05:42:29,870 --> 05:42:31,150
I'm okay, I'm okay.

7104
05:42:35,270 --> 05:42:37,270
Is everybody okay?

7105
05:42:39,290 --> 05:42:41,110
Oh my god.

7106
05:42:41,450 --> 05:42:43,810
Oh my god.

7107
05:42:45,290 --> 05:42:46,170
Holy shit.

7108
05:42:48,070 --> 05:42:49,590
That's fine.

7109
05:42:57,050 --> 05:42:58,690
She's flying away.

7110
05:42:59,490 --> 05:42:59,710
No.

7111
05:43:04,850 --> 05:43:05,930
Justice.

7112
05:43:11,230 --> 05:43:12,730
That's fine.

7113
05:43:12,890 --> 05:43:14,850
Everything is A-okay.

7114
05:43:14,850 --> 05:43:16,830
I froze somebody.

7115
05:43:19,530 --> 05:43:20,490
It's fine.

7116
05:43:20,570 --> 05:43:21,530
Everything is fine.

7117
05:43:24,850 --> 05:43:26,210
Everything is so healthy.

7118
05:43:26,290 --> 05:43:27,950
Just keep the rank one guy alive.

7119
05:43:30,590 --> 05:43:32,890
Surely he can 1v6 everybody.

7120
05:43:33,470 --> 05:43:34,330
Surely, right?

7121
05:43:35,730 --> 05:43:37,030
Oh my god!

7122
05:43:37,950 --> 05:43:39,230
That was my bad.

7123
05:43:41,970 --> 05:43:44,410
I looked at my chat.

7124
05:43:52,930 --> 05:43:54,910
I thought I was safe.

7125
05:43:57,930 --> 05:43:59,850
I literally looked away.

7126
05:44:03,030 --> 05:44:04,270
I'm locked in for real.

7127
05:44:04,590 --> 05:44:06,390
This is why I normally don't stream.

7128
05:44:06,390 --> 05:44:07,370
I stream if I rank right.

7129
05:44:07,530 --> 05:44:08,910
I'm never locked in.

7130
05:44:10,910 --> 05:44:12,810
I have a Psylocke on me.

7131
05:44:12,810 --> 05:44:13,510
I might be dead.

7132
05:44:17,150 --> 05:44:19,090
I'm gonna die in the chat.

7133
05:44:21,510 --> 05:44:22,090
Guys.

7134
05:44:22,590 --> 05:44:23,510
Okay, I can't.

7135
05:44:23,510 --> 05:44:25,470
I can't freaking die here.

7136
05:44:26,570 --> 05:44:27,430
Everything is fine.

7137
05:44:27,450 --> 05:44:28,650
See, everything is fine.

7138
05:44:29,610 --> 05:44:30,390
I'm locked in.

7139
05:44:30,610 --> 05:44:31,370
For real.

7140
05:44:32,190 --> 05:44:35,950
I literally thought I was in the safest part possible.

7141
05:44:36,450 --> 05:44:40,830
I was like, there's nothing that can kill me in this corner.

7142
05:44:41,130 --> 05:44:44,650
What could kill me?

7143
05:44:47,370 --> 05:44:48,650
Who knew?

7144
05:44:48,830 --> 05:44:52,290
It was a fucking scroll I was like, I don't have to look.

7145
05:44:56,090 --> 05:45:03,290
Now, how did this that went 14-4 get MVP over me?

7146
05:45:03,370 --> 05:45:04,510
I'm gonna shit my pants.

7147
05:45:17,960 --> 05:45:19,380
Oh my god.

7148
05:45:19,580 --> 05:45:20,660
We did it, guys.

7149
05:45:20,880 --> 05:45:22,680
I'm still GM too, but we did it.

7150
05:45:22,800 --> 05:45:24,660
We did it.

7151
05:45:25,260 --> 05:45:25,740
God.

7152
05:45:27,500 --> 05:45:29,960
As long as we keep the- Is he actually rank 1 right now?

7153
05:45:31,460 --> 05:45:31,940
Oh.

7154
05:45:35,100 --> 05:45:36,060
I mean...

7155
05:45:36,060 --> 05:45:36,540
Wait.

7156
05:45:41,700 --> 05:45:42,300
Okay.

7157
05:45:42,920 --> 05:45:43,440
Alright.

7158
05:45:43,600 --> 05:45:44,340
I need to check.

7159
05:45:47,020 --> 05:45:48,080
Oh, shit!

7160
05:45:51,690 --> 05:45:53,570
Oh my god, he is rank 1.

7161
05:45:56,250 --> 05:45:57,610
Oh my god.

7162
05:46:10,150 --> 05:46:10,750
Alright.

7163
05:46:11,250 --> 05:46:12,170
Sorry, I was like...

7164
05:46:12,610 --> 05:46:17,550
We're trying to convict- We're trying to see if we can join up, but we can't.

7165
05:46:20,110 --> 05:46:21,090
Sorry, guys.

7166
05:46:21,650 --> 05:46:21,970
Alright.

7167
05:46:28,930 --> 05:46:30,370
Okay, let me just keep going.

7168
05:46:30,550 --> 05:46:31,090
We keep going.

7169
05:46:45,390 --> 05:46:45,990
Alright.

7170
05:46:47,290 --> 05:46:49,590
Yeah, mace is second mace.

7171
05:46:50,970 --> 05:46:53,130
I didn't realize he was rank 1!

7172
05:46:54,170 --> 05:46:56,270
Oh my god, that's crazy.

7173
05:46:57,630 --> 05:46:58,930
I was like, whoa.

7174
05:46:58,930 --> 05:46:59,090
Whoa.

7175
05:47:02,420 --> 05:47:03,840
We keep going.

7176
05:47:23,630 --> 05:47:25,890
I still don't know how he got in the party.

7177
05:47:26,350 --> 05:47:27,610
I still don't know.

7178
05:47:27,810 --> 05:47:29,330
I literally didn't accept anything.

7179
05:47:29,770 --> 05:47:31,130
I didn't accept anything.

7180
05:47:31,730 --> 05:47:34,310
He doesn't have- I don't have a lot of friends list.

7181
05:47:34,650 --> 05:47:36,710
I don't know how he did it.

7182
05:47:39,230 --> 05:47:40,070
I'm gonna do it.

7183
05:47:43,570 --> 05:47:45,550
Please, I beg of you to vote for Hulk.

7184
05:47:45,690 --> 05:47:46,670
Please don't ban Sleeves.

7185
05:47:46,670 --> 05:47:48,990
The lack of Sleeves is hitting me.

7186
05:47:49,130 --> 05:47:49,770
No, I should know.

7187
05:47:50,890 --> 05:47:52,290
Can he join through?

7188
05:47:52,630 --> 05:47:54,030
Wait, I thought he can join through.

7189
05:47:54,210 --> 05:47:54,910
Oh, shit!

7190
05:47:58,690 --> 05:48:01,270
Alright, I'll ban Hulk now.

7191
05:48:03,610 --> 05:48:04,390
That's right.

7192
05:48:04,850 --> 05:48:05,890
Learn other characters.

7193
05:48:07,930 --> 05:48:09,290
Stop being a one-trick.

7194
05:48:14,790 --> 05:48:17,490
This guy's a Psylocke one-trick.

7195
05:48:17,910 --> 05:48:19,950
No, I'm fucking not, bro.

7196
05:48:23,890 --> 05:48:26,710
I listened to the rank one guy.

7197
05:48:27,730 --> 05:48:28,090
What do you mean?

7198
05:48:29,050 --> 05:48:31,490
I flexed so hard.

7199
05:48:32,330 --> 05:48:33,050
I flexed.

7200
05:48:33,110 --> 05:48:34,890
Let's get off the store.

7201
05:48:34,890 --> 05:48:35,510
Ruben.

7202
05:48:43,840 --> 05:48:45,540
Ruben, bust out the Black Panther.

7203
05:48:45,920 --> 05:48:46,940
Bust out the Black Panther.

7204
05:48:47,240 --> 05:48:48,220
Hell no.

7205
05:48:50,380 --> 05:48:52,540
Yeah, I'm trying Twitch for Marvel Rivals.

7206
05:48:52,920 --> 05:48:54,280
How long am I streaming for?

7207
05:48:56,820 --> 05:48:57,440
How long?

7208
05:48:58,960 --> 05:49:00,040
Oh my god.

7209
05:49:03,180 --> 05:49:03,660
Okay.

7210
05:49:04,780 --> 05:49:05,980
It's okay, I have gamer subs.

7211
05:49:06,340 --> 05:49:08,200
Guys, you guys know I have a gamer sub code?

7212
05:49:08,200 --> 05:49:09,340
Oh my god.

7213
05:49:09,680 --> 05:49:11,300
Seamless transition, by the way.

7214
05:49:16,500 --> 05:49:17,760
Seamless transition.

7215
05:49:18,260 --> 05:49:27,220
But like, if you use my code, DokiBird, you can get 10% off on your order and I get money for it.

7216
05:49:28,020 --> 05:49:29,700
I mean, obviously.

7217
05:49:31,160 --> 05:49:32,920
But only if you use my code.

7218
05:49:33,040 --> 05:49:34,200
Only if you use my code.

7219
05:49:38,200 --> 05:49:38,380
Yeah.

7220
05:49:39,040 --> 05:49:39,920
That's my rank now.

7221
05:49:40,980 --> 05:49:42,920
I'll talk about it if we win this game.

7222
05:49:44,120 --> 05:49:47,600
I'll tell you my rank if we win this game, guys.

7223
05:49:56,310 --> 05:49:57,250
That's fine.

7224
05:50:01,350 --> 05:50:03,650
Not the reload hands!

7225
05:50:03,870 --> 05:50:05,250
Oh, he is so...

7226
05:50:05,250 --> 05:50:07,210
Who cares about the fucking...

7227
05:50:07,210 --> 05:50:08,190
Who cares, Bronzy?

7228
05:50:09,410 --> 05:50:10,990
Oh, you're not mace.

7229
05:50:14,590 --> 05:50:17,590
If mace is alive, he can carry it all.

7230
05:50:21,710 --> 05:50:24,830
He can carry us all to the promised land.

7231
05:50:25,610 --> 05:50:26,590
Mace, please.

7232
05:50:26,710 --> 05:50:27,890
You can't die.

7233
05:50:29,570 --> 05:50:31,570
As long as you're alive.

7234
05:50:31,970 --> 05:50:32,870
Oh, and me too.

7235
05:50:33,050 --> 05:50:34,250
Because I need to be...

7236
05:50:36,270 --> 05:50:39,250
Because I need to be alive to make sure he's alive.

7237
05:50:39,970 --> 05:50:40,490
Oh god.

7238
05:50:40,830 --> 05:50:41,070
Clap.

7239
05:50:41,430 --> 05:50:41,690
Clap.

7240
05:50:42,030 --> 05:50:42,590
Clap.

7241
05:50:43,270 --> 05:50:43,450
Clap.

7242
05:50:43,450 --> 05:50:43,630
Clap.

7243
05:50:45,470 --> 05:50:46,130
Clap.

7244
05:50:46,410 --> 05:50:46,410
Clap.

7245
05:50:48,450 --> 05:50:49,150
Oh my god.

7246
05:50:53,370 --> 05:50:54,630
Don't worry, mace!

7247
05:50:54,730 --> 05:50:56,910
I will ult to save your life!

7248
05:50:57,430 --> 05:50:58,350
But you're okay.

7249
05:50:59,010 --> 05:50:59,630
You're okay.

7250
05:51:01,290 --> 05:51:02,650
He's so okay.

7251
05:51:04,570 --> 05:51:06,210
Oh my god.

7252
05:51:09,330 --> 05:51:10,310
It's fine.

7253
05:51:14,490 --> 05:51:14,970
Um...

7254
05:51:14,970 --> 05:51:16,930
He has strange ult, so I'm backing off.

7255
05:51:18,290 --> 05:51:19,390
He has strange ult.

7256
05:51:22,190 --> 05:51:23,270
This is worth.

7257
05:51:25,630 --> 05:51:27,010
I believe in our magneto.

7258
05:51:28,330 --> 05:51:28,570
Oh.

7259
05:51:30,810 --> 05:51:31,710
Mace is alive though.

7260
05:51:32,590 --> 05:51:33,770
Oh, mace is so healthy.

7261
05:51:34,410 --> 05:51:35,330
Okay, I gotta heal.

7262
05:51:35,330 --> 05:51:36,430
I'm gonna heal other people now.

7263
05:51:36,650 --> 05:51:38,290
I'm actually gonna focus up here.

7264
05:51:40,630 --> 05:51:43,390
I'm saving Mace's ult accounts KDA.

7265
05:51:44,290 --> 05:51:45,930
That's all that matters.

7266
05:51:47,590 --> 05:51:50,490
His ult accounts KDA is doing great.

7267
05:51:51,550 --> 05:51:52,250
Oh my

7268
05:51:57,550 --> 05:51:59,890
god.

7269
05:52:00,430 --> 05:52:01,370
There we go.

7270
05:52:01,770 --> 05:52:03,310
Mace, your KDA is fine.

7271
05:52:05,230 --> 05:52:07,610
Your KDA will be so healthy.

7272
05:52:08,510 --> 05:52:09,090
Okay.

7273
05:52:14,220 --> 05:52:15,260
I'm not gonna use my ult.

7274
05:52:22,120 --> 05:52:23,020
There we go.

7275
05:52:23,140 --> 05:52:23,760
Look at that.

7276
05:52:24,120 --> 05:52:26,400
Zero deaths, as it should be.

7277
05:52:31,640 --> 05:52:32,360
Zero...

7278
05:52:32,360 --> 05:52:34,120
Oh my...

7279
05:52:35,900 --> 05:52:36,620
Okay.

7280
05:52:37,560 --> 05:52:38,700
Alright, everybody.

7281
05:52:40,660 --> 05:52:42,780
This is last fight, guys.

7282
05:52:44,640 --> 05:52:45,840
Oh shit!

7283
05:52:45,980 --> 05:52:47,100
This is a great one.

7284
05:52:48,020 --> 05:52:48,980
This is actually really good.

7285
05:52:54,700 --> 05:52:56,060
Oh, Magni on point.

7286
05:52:58,240 --> 05:52:58,920
Yay!

7287
05:53:01,160 --> 05:53:03,500
Don't let the rank 1 die!

7288
05:53:04,560 --> 05:53:06,360
Don't let him die.

7289
05:53:07,300 --> 05:53:12,140
Please, I swear to god, I'm doing everything I can to keep him alive.

7290
05:53:12,580 --> 05:53:16,840
Oh my god, he's alive.

7291
05:53:18,240 --> 05:53:19,640
As it should be.

7292
05:53:23,890 --> 05:53:24,650
Goodbye.

7293
05:53:28,670 --> 05:53:30,510
Jesus Christ.

7294
05:53:30,850 --> 05:53:35,870
I was gonna say, how did our Mantis live through all that?

7295
05:53:36,170 --> 05:53:36,930
But he didn't.

7296
05:53:37,750 --> 05:53:38,870
He actually didn't.

7297
05:53:41,910 --> 05:53:42,630
Okay.

7298
05:53:52,430 --> 05:53:53,830
He's got this.

7299
05:53:53,830 --> 05:53:55,310
I believe.

7300
05:53:57,470 --> 05:53:58,070
Yippee!

7301
05:53:58,750 --> 05:53:59,830
I should let the Magneto die.

7302
05:54:02,290 --> 05:54:03,190
Oh nice.

7303
05:54:03,310 --> 05:54:04,730
Okay, I thought that was...

7304
05:54:04,730 --> 05:54:07,170
Only one person can have zero deaths.

7305
05:54:07,630 --> 05:54:09,810
And it has to be the rank 1 guy.

7306
05:54:14,890 --> 05:54:15,490
It's fine.

7307
05:54:20,130 --> 05:54:20,950
It's so fine.

7308
05:54:20,950 --> 05:54:21,630
Yes.

7309
05:54:22,690 --> 05:54:23,870
Oh my god.

7310
05:54:24,050 --> 05:54:24,970
Poor guy.

7311
05:54:25,990 --> 05:54:26,910
Poor guy.

7312
05:54:27,110 --> 05:54:27,750
Oh my god.

7313
05:54:27,850 --> 05:54:30,270
If I could let the Magneto die right now.

7314
05:54:31,470 --> 05:54:32,070
Okay!

7315
05:54:32,670 --> 05:54:33,430
It was not it.

7316
05:54:33,510 --> 05:54:34,530
I swear to god.

7317
05:54:34,610 --> 05:54:35,390
It was not it.

7318
05:54:35,850 --> 05:54:38,630
I swear to god.

7319
05:54:38,730 --> 05:54:40,310
It was not intentional.

7320
05:54:41,170 --> 05:54:42,870
Oh my god.

7321
05:54:44,450 --> 05:54:46,090
I swear to god.

7322
05:54:47,270 --> 05:54:48,690
As it should be.

7323
05:54:48,690 --> 05:54:54,690
Only one person can have zero deaths.

7324
05:54:57,530 --> 05:54:58,310
Die!

7325
05:55:00,970 --> 05:55:05,530
No, you're not dying.

7326
05:55:06,200 --> 05:55:07,510
You're not dying.

7327
05:55:08,530 --> 05:55:10,370
You're not dying!

7328
05:55:10,950 --> 05:55:11,450
Oh shit.

7329
05:55:13,650 --> 05:55:14,410
Oh!

7330
05:55:14,850 --> 05:55:15,770
I didn't want to die!

7331
05:55:18,670 --> 05:55:19,630
I didn't want to ult!

7332
05:55:19,730 --> 05:55:22,250
I wasn't gonna ult from EDA.

7333
05:55:22,750 --> 05:55:23,410
I didn't care.

7334
05:55:24,690 --> 05:55:26,010
I cared.

7335
05:55:26,570 --> 05:55:27,570
But also I...

7336
05:55:27,570 --> 05:55:28,670
I cared.

7337
05:55:28,850 --> 05:55:29,390
I cared.

7338
05:55:29,830 --> 05:55:31,970
I fucking cared so much.

7339
05:55:32,230 --> 05:55:33,610
I cared.

7340
05:55:33,890 --> 05:55:36,530
I cared so much.

7341
05:55:36,830 --> 05:55:37,170
No!

7342
05:55:42,590 --> 05:55:43,630
There we go.

7343
05:55:43,790 --> 05:55:45,210
That's what we wanna hear.

7344
05:55:46,950 --> 05:55:48,990
That's what we wanna hear.

7345
05:55:52,630 --> 05:55:53,590
Did she dodge that?

7346
05:55:53,750 --> 05:55:56,570
Oh, when I try to dodge it, I fucking die.

7347
05:56:03,150 --> 05:56:07,770
Like, when that happens to me, I just fucking collapse.

7348
05:56:09,630 --> 05:56:11,730
Don't worry, rank one!

7349
05:56:13,390 --> 05:56:14,550
That's looking right.

7350
05:56:15,570 --> 05:56:17,030
A rank one should never die.

7351
05:56:18,750 --> 05:56:20,290
You... Okay, I guess that's it.

7352
05:56:20,290 --> 05:56:20,750
No, thanks.

7353
05:56:24,010 --> 05:56:27,930
I can't believe this Mantis wouldn't like, keep me alive with his ult.

7354
05:56:28,270 --> 05:56:31,110
Like, I should be important enough to have a Mantis ult.

7355
05:56:31,690 --> 05:56:32,030
Honestly.

7356
05:56:32,850 --> 05:56:33,750
I'm a street... Oh.

7357
05:56:34,610 --> 05:56:36,270
I don't... My god.

7358
05:56:36,710 --> 05:56:37,670
Oh my god.

7359
05:56:37,730 --> 05:56:37,930
Okay.

7360
05:56:38,670 --> 05:56:39,610
I will ult this.

7361
05:56:39,730 --> 05:56:40,410
I will...

7362
05:56:40,410 --> 05:56:41,930
I will...

7363
05:56:41,930 --> 05:56:42,050
Like,

7364
05:56:46,440 --> 05:56:47,940
there's no reason for me to ult yet.

7365
05:56:52,700 --> 05:56:54,860
Oh, no.

7366
05:56:55,240 --> 05:56:56,920
I wanted to keep him up.

7367
05:56:57,360 --> 05:56:57,940
That's fine.

7368
05:56:59,400 --> 05:57:00,220
That's fine.

7369
05:57:03,140 --> 05:57:03,620
That's...

7370
05:57:05,900 --> 05:57:06,540
Oh, hey.

7371
05:57:06,600 --> 05:57:06,960
Nice.

7372
05:57:07,860 --> 05:57:08,620
She got the ult.

7373
05:57:09,040 --> 05:57:10,780
It took me 20 years to get...

7374
05:57:10,780 --> 05:57:12,440
It took me 20 years to decide to ult.

7375
05:57:14,020 --> 05:57:15,120
Oh, that would've hit.

7376
05:57:16,100 --> 05:57:18,380
That would've 100% hit.

7377
05:57:20,960 --> 05:57:22,000
Okay, whoops.

7378
05:57:24,220 --> 05:57:25,680
I'll just shit my pants, I guess.

7379
05:57:28,700 --> 05:57:30,180
Oh my god, please.

7380
05:57:30,940 --> 05:57:32,280
It's the final 10 seconds.

7381
05:57:33,260 --> 05:57:35,520
I don't know if I can...

7382
05:57:35,520 --> 05:57:36,940
Oh, please bug out right now.

7383
05:57:37,160 --> 05:57:39,780
Please bug out right now and have it all be damaged.

7384
05:57:40,240 --> 05:57:40,620
Please.

7385
05:57:42,020 --> 05:57:43,480
Oh my god, wrong person.

7386
05:57:43,480 --> 05:57:45,380
I wanted to freeze him.

7387
05:57:45,480 --> 05:57:46,100
No.

7388
05:57:47,440 --> 05:57:48,620
Miss, no.

7389
05:57:48,880 --> 05:57:50,040
Just don't touch the cart.

7390
05:57:50,240 --> 05:57:51,780
Keep your KDA up.

7391
05:57:52,240 --> 05:57:52,640
Miss.

7392
05:57:53,300 --> 05:57:54,640
No, miss.

7393
05:57:55,260 --> 05:57:57,400
No, I worked so hard.

7394
05:58:00,580 --> 05:58:03,460
I ran and you just not even touched the cart.

7395
05:58:04,080 --> 05:58:05,760
I can TP back.

7396
05:58:05,800 --> 05:58:06,620
I can TP back.

7397
05:58:11,360 --> 05:58:15,360
I worked so hard to give him 0 deaths.

7398
05:58:15,880 --> 05:58:18,560
After he touched the cart and gave his life away.

7399
05:58:18,840 --> 05:58:20,300
How could you let me die?

7400
05:58:21,640 --> 05:58:22,940
My one death.

7401
05:58:24,360 --> 05:58:26,000
The blood is on your hands.

7402
05:58:29,200 --> 05:58:31,200
Why did you touch the cart?

7403
05:58:37,170 --> 05:58:42,410
If he didn't touch the cart, he could have lived.

7404
05:58:46,530 --> 05:58:49,130
He could have fucking lived.

7405
05:58:51,730 --> 05:58:53,170
I can't believe it.

7406
05:58:53,210 --> 05:58:54,170
One death washed.

7407
05:58:57,930 --> 05:58:59,490
Can't believe it, Miss.

7408
05:58:59,930 --> 05:59:01,570
One death already washed.

7409
05:59:01,730 --> 05:59:02,370
Feels bad.

7410
05:59:03,610 --> 05:59:04,650
Okay, why?

7411
05:59:06,710 --> 05:59:08,550
Why did he touch the cart?

7412
05:59:08,690 --> 05:59:09,710
He could have lived.

7413
05:59:10,430 --> 05:59:14,410
He could have just watched it from afar and kept it clean.

7414
05:59:15,470 --> 05:59:17,350
How could he do this to me?

7415
05:59:18,390 --> 05:59:20,930
I worked so hard to keep it spotless 0.

7416
05:59:20,990 --> 05:59:23,730
I even sacrificed my own KDA for it.

7417
05:59:25,030 --> 05:59:26,710
Oh no, 100% addicted.

7418
05:59:27,070 --> 05:59:27,290
No.

7419
05:59:27,670 --> 05:59:28,550
That's why I'm still here.

7420
05:59:29,070 --> 05:59:30,050
It's like 6 in the morning.

7421
05:59:30,910 --> 05:59:33,430
I'm about to fucking walk my dog and feed.

7422
05:59:34,490 --> 05:59:36,210
I'll still be streaming.

7423
05:59:36,850 --> 05:59:37,530
Alright, where is he?

7424
05:59:38,190 --> 05:59:39,710
This horde will never leave you.

7425
05:59:41,210 --> 05:59:41,830
My team?

7426
05:59:41,970 --> 05:59:43,090
We don't have a team.

7427
05:59:43,170 --> 05:59:44,090
We just have Mace.

7428
05:59:48,110 --> 05:59:49,990
Mace took 0 damage.

7429
05:59:50,490 --> 05:59:52,150
Okay, he's taking damage.

7430
05:59:53,390 --> 05:59:54,050
But I clap.

7431
05:59:55,650 --> 05:59:56,910
I clap now.

7432
06:00:02,100 --> 06:00:02,700
It's okay.

7433
06:00:06,160 --> 06:00:07,860
Jesus Christ.

7434
06:00:13,820 --> 06:00:14,420
Okay.

7435
06:00:15,960 --> 06:00:16,860
I'm just...

7436
06:00:16,860 --> 06:00:18,100
I'm never letting go.

7437
06:00:18,600 --> 06:00:19,880
Left click, I guess.

7438
06:00:20,360 --> 06:00:21,840
Oh my god, there's 3 people to our right.

7439
06:00:24,860 --> 06:00:26,380
That's a lot of people.

7440
06:00:29,480 --> 06:00:30,480
Look at that.

7441
06:00:31,020 --> 06:00:32,620
He's so healthy.

7442
06:00:32,980 --> 06:00:36,140
My teammates, my mantis can deal with my teammates.

7443
06:00:40,570 --> 06:00:41,290
No!

7444
06:00:46,210 --> 06:00:48,230
That wasn't my fault.

7445
06:00:48,690 --> 06:00:51,470
Guys, that was definitely not my fault.

7446
06:00:52,430 --> 06:00:54,570
Oh my god, they have a...

7447
06:00:54,570 --> 06:00:56,270
No, I have to put on a goddamn...

7448
06:00:56,990 --> 06:00:58,350
Oh, goodbye.

7449
06:00:58,930 --> 06:01:00,270
Oh, what?

7450
06:01:00,270 --> 06:01:00,550
What?

7451
06:01:01,490 --> 06:01:02,850
Okay, I need to see this.

7452
06:01:02,950 --> 06:01:03,790
I couldn't even Q.

7453
06:01:05,870 --> 06:01:07,130
They must have 3, 2, 1.

7454
06:01:07,250 --> 06:01:10,270
There's no way they did...

7455
06:01:13,450 --> 06:01:13,950
Yay!

7456
06:01:16,030 --> 06:01:17,590
I'm here now.

7457
06:01:18,110 --> 06:01:20,370
I'm here now.

7458
06:01:21,130 --> 06:01:21,690
Yay!

7459
06:01:23,930 --> 06:01:25,590
This is gonna be...

7460
06:01:25,590 --> 06:01:25,930
Yay!

7461
06:01:25,930 --> 06:01:26,310
Yay!

7462
06:01:31,610 --> 06:01:33,470
Oh my god, where's me?

7463
06:01:34,030 --> 06:01:34,970
Oh my god.

7464
06:01:36,310 --> 06:01:37,960
Oh my god, I got...

7465
06:01:39,150 --> 06:01:40,140
How did I...

7466
06:01:40,890 --> 06:01:42,190
Oh my god!

7467
06:01:42,590 --> 06:01:46,170
That was the sickest freeze of... Okay, that was...

7468
06:01:46,170 --> 06:01:48,610
I've been having a lot of sick freezes, not gonna lie.

7469
06:01:49,070 --> 06:01:54,090
My freezes have been pretty fucking sick.

7470
06:01:58,490 --> 06:02:01,910
I tell you, Luna freezes are so easy.

7471
06:02:05,310 --> 06:02:06,350
Really, like...

7472
06:02:06,350 --> 06:02:09,170
I literally just look at them and they're frozen.

7473
06:02:12,030 --> 06:02:13,990
It's easier than Ana sleep dart.

7474
06:02:14,190 --> 06:02:18,110
I used to do Ana sleep darts a lot for practice when I used to scrim.

7475
06:02:21,290 --> 06:02:22,210
Oh my god!

7476
06:02:22,250 --> 06:02:24,150
No, there's a fucking Magneto on the right!

7477
06:02:24,150 --> 06:02:24,370
Fuck!

7478
06:02:26,850 --> 06:02:29,390
I was like, what hit me?

7479
06:02:30,630 --> 06:02:31,830
Holy shit!

7480
06:02:32,350 --> 06:02:35,850
Oh my god, I got like fucking punched in the right.

7481
06:02:36,070 --> 06:02:38,170
Like, that was crazy.

7482
06:02:38,970 --> 06:02:41,190
I was like, what punched me?

7483
06:02:43,770 --> 06:02:44,770
Not the moon.

7484
06:02:45,970 --> 06:02:46,750
The moon.

7485
06:02:47,670 --> 06:02:51,630
I would not have saved these people.

7486
06:02:53,010 --> 06:02:53,530
Honestly.

7487
06:02:55,370 --> 06:02:56,710
It's just us two.

7488
06:02:56,810 --> 06:02:59,630
Unless we do like the sickest...

7489
06:03:00,630 --> 06:03:01,150
Okay.

7490
06:03:02,190 --> 06:03:05,210
I think we're doing the sickest play of our lives right now.

7491
06:03:07,510 --> 06:03:08,790
Oh my god.

7492
06:03:09,490 --> 06:03:10,050
Mace, please.

7493
06:03:11,430 --> 06:03:13,550
I'm so fucking scared for you, Mace.

7494
06:03:13,950 --> 06:03:14,870
Mace, no!

7495
06:03:15,910 --> 06:03:16,330
No!

7496
06:03:22,110 --> 06:03:23,130
Magneto, Magneto!

7497
06:03:25,190 --> 06:03:26,710
Oh my god.

7498
06:03:30,230 --> 06:03:32,230
We did it!

7499
06:03:33,510 --> 06:03:34,350
Yeah!

7500
06:03:36,430 --> 06:03:37,790
Oh shit, Mantis!

7501
06:03:40,830 --> 06:03:44,430
I was like, where did he come from?

7502
06:03:46,660 --> 06:03:48,140
Jump scare.

7503
06:03:48,900 --> 06:03:51,100
She just walked up.

7504
06:03:53,240 --> 06:03:54,160
Wow.

7505
06:03:54,680 --> 06:03:58,280
I don't know, maybe somebody's washed right now.

7506
06:04:04,260 --> 06:04:08,480
It's like that office meet where like, Angela...

7507
06:04:12,380 --> 06:04:13,640
That's it.

7508
06:04:16,660 --> 06:04:18,100
Hey guys, I'm GM1.

7509
06:04:18,240 --> 06:04:19,780
For those who are wondering what rank I am.

7510
06:04:28,200 --> 06:04:29,600
Oh my god.

7511
06:04:31,200 --> 06:04:33,400
Confirm not one trick.

7512
06:04:37,990 --> 06:04:39,570
Oh my god, we did it.

7513
06:04:39,710 --> 06:04:41,430
We fucking got back to GM1.

7514
06:04:41,590 --> 06:04:44,290
Back to GM1, we're so back.

7515
06:04:48,310 --> 06:04:50,450
I can't believe it, how could a rank 1 die three times?

7516
06:04:52,950 --> 06:04:54,470
We're so back.

7517
06:04:55,250 --> 06:04:59,630
Not gonna lie, 40k of that definitely went to Mace.

7518
06:04:59,810 --> 06:05:01,610
I did not care about anybody else.

7519
06:05:01,690 --> 06:05:04,910
I used other people so I could heal Mace because he was too far away.

7520
06:05:12,470 --> 06:05:13,910
Oh my god.

7521
06:05:14,130 --> 06:05:17,050
It would've been two deaths if he didn't fucking touch the cart.

7522
06:05:17,050 --> 06:05:19,210
He didn't need to touch the fucking cart.

7523
06:05:19,230 --> 06:05:19,890
It was over.

7524
06:05:20,290 --> 06:05:22,270
We all knew it was fucking over.

7525
06:05:26,470 --> 06:05:31,050
Oh no, I was gonna be like, I'll start stream when I'm back to GM1 because I lost GM1 in the morning.

7526
06:05:31,630 --> 06:05:32,790
Yesterday night morning.

7527
06:05:33,490 --> 06:05:34,830
And then like...

7528
06:05:35,790 --> 06:05:38,330
And then like...

7529
06:05:38,330 --> 06:05:42,350
And then I started stream when we were back in GM1 and now we're back in GM1 again.

7530
06:05:42,790 --> 06:05:43,750
We've been very unlucky.

7531
06:05:44,650 --> 06:05:45,050
Unlucky?

7532
06:05:45,130 --> 06:05:46,130
Okay, let me show you guys.

7533
06:05:46,130 --> 06:05:48,390
We've been a little unlucky.

7534
06:05:48,710 --> 06:05:52,430
We would have like solid wins and then like, you know.

7535
06:05:54,170 --> 06:05:55,010
Yes.

7536
06:06:02,710 --> 06:06:10,730
Ruben, if you deserve eternity, then you can flex.

7537
06:06:16,130 --> 06:06:17,070
It's real.

7538
06:06:24,070 --> 06:06:32,350
If you're an eternity player and you can't fucking flex, we're gonna ban your one trick until you learn.

7539
06:06:32,590 --> 06:06:34,430
Until you learn to flex.

7540
06:06:37,290 --> 06:06:37,930
Exactly.

7541
06:06:38,430 --> 06:06:42,290
You don't wanna be a one trick that gets the pick ban every time.

7542
06:06:52,220 --> 06:06:53,340
Oh shit!

7543
06:06:59,810 --> 06:07:02,070
Which hero do you think you wanna be today?

7544
06:07:04,050 --> 06:07:05,110
I'm Luna Snow.

7545
06:07:05,470 --> 06:07:08,230
Like the moon, I shine in darkness.

7546
06:07:09,170 --> 06:07:14,890
If you get outtanked by a hard stick, I'm going to laugh.

7547
06:07:19,190 --> 06:07:21,250
It looks like our guy wants to play.

7548
06:07:21,370 --> 06:07:21,490
Okay.

7549
06:07:21,490 --> 06:07:21,570
Okay.

7550
06:07:27,190 --> 06:07:28,570
That's awkward.

7551
06:07:29,330 --> 06:07:31,270
That's actually awkward.

7552
06:07:37,680 --> 06:07:39,800
Alright, then we ban Hawkeye.

7553
06:07:43,300 --> 06:07:44,340
Alright.

7554
06:07:49,940 --> 06:07:51,400
Oh wait, yeah.

7555
06:07:51,400 --> 06:07:54,420
If I don't ban Luna, I'll be Mantis Loki, that's fine.

7556
06:07:57,180 --> 06:07:57,660
Oh!

7557
06:08:00,580 --> 06:08:01,680
That works out.

7558
06:08:01,840 --> 06:08:07,400
That works out.

7559
06:08:07,880 --> 06:08:09,300
For all of us.

7560
06:08:11,220 --> 06:08:11,800
Oh my god.

7561
06:08:11,880 --> 06:08:15,240
Okay, we'll see if Mace is gonna get attacked by hard stick.

7562
06:08:18,180 --> 06:08:22,160
How the fuck do you play a hero Hawkeye in this elo?

7563
06:08:23,800 --> 06:08:24,320
How?

7564
06:08:24,520 --> 06:08:26,540
How were you able to play Hawkeye at all?

7565
06:08:27,480 --> 06:08:28,800
That's actually crazy.

7566
06:08:29,060 --> 06:08:32,520
I still don't have a hero on my other supports.

7567
06:08:32,760 --> 06:08:34,600
I only have it on Luna.

7568
06:08:38,400 --> 06:08:39,560
I'm so happy.

7569
06:08:41,820 --> 06:08:43,520
Guys, this is my GM game.

7570
06:08:43,640 --> 06:08:44,600
Can we please lock in?

7571
06:08:45,100 --> 06:08:46,000
Can we please go goats?

7572
06:08:49,340 --> 06:08:50,040
Oh my god.

7573
06:08:50,080 --> 06:08:51,580
Wait, did he say this is his GM game?

7574
06:09:02,660 --> 06:09:03,020
Alright,

7575
06:09:07,920 --> 06:09:10,420
here we go.

7576
06:09:10,840 --> 06:09:14,160
For all the people who are new here, my name is DokiBear and I stream on the YouTubes.

7577
06:09:15,000 --> 06:09:16,380
I'm doing my rank right here.

7578
06:09:16,380 --> 06:09:18,380
Cause I'm fucking crazy.

7579
06:09:21,520 --> 06:09:23,360
I've been on for a while.

7580
06:09:24,060 --> 06:09:25,580
I love my Roavers.

7581
06:09:25,700 --> 06:09:28,480
I will play this game for the rest of my life.

7582
06:09:30,180 --> 06:09:35,260
Until a new hero shooter comes out and then I'm gonna dedicate my life to that too.

7583
06:09:37,340 --> 06:09:39,780
Alright Mace, I believe in your damage boost.

7584
06:09:40,740 --> 06:09:44,400
I'm scared cause I know Mendo's a crazy Hawkeye.

7585
06:09:44,400 --> 06:09:44,940
Oh goodbye.

7586
06:09:56,440 --> 06:09:57,740
That's funny though.

7587
06:09:57,820 --> 06:10:02,100
That's pretty funny.

7588
06:10:10,140 --> 06:10:14,360
I know he's a crazy Hanzo player.

7589
06:10:14,600 --> 06:10:16,480
That's a Hanzo player.

7590
06:10:16,600 --> 06:10:17,260
That's what I was like.

7591
06:10:17,360 --> 06:10:28,360
Oh my god.

7592
06:10:36,990 --> 06:10:38,030
I'm almost back.

7593
06:10:40,190 --> 06:10:41,590
Oh my god.

7594
06:10:42,550 --> 06:10:44,230
I'm gonna grab this so I can grab this.

7595
06:10:47,910 --> 06:10:49,030
Oh my god.

7596
06:10:49,210 --> 06:10:51,090
He lost to it.

7597
06:10:56,770 --> 06:10:58,810
The Hawkeye can still kill me though.

7598
06:10:59,090 --> 06:11:00,870
So that's... I'm scared about that.

7599
06:11:04,850 --> 06:11:07,130
I'm scared about the...

7600
06:11:07,130 --> 06:11:08,650
I'm scared about that though.

7601
06:11:14,170 --> 06:11:14,750
No way.

7602
06:11:22,930 --> 06:11:23,930
That's fine.

7603
06:11:29,510 --> 06:11:30,350
That's fine.

7604
06:11:30,490 --> 06:11:31,650
We're so... wait there's a...

7605
06:11:32,290 --> 06:11:32,870
Is that our portal?

7606
06:11:32,970 --> 06:11:33,790
Oh that's our portal.

7607
06:11:34,150 --> 06:11:34,470
Nice.

7608
06:11:35,590 --> 06:11:36,670
That's our portal.

7609
06:11:36,930 --> 06:11:37,830
Thank god.

7610
06:11:41,810 --> 06:11:43,390
Imagine having a death.

7611
06:11:45,270 --> 06:11:46,390
Mendo cut.

7612
06:11:47,870 --> 06:11:48,210
You know what?

7613
06:11:48,230 --> 06:11:50,470
I'm glad that we didn't ban the Hawkeye.

7614
06:11:52,810 --> 06:11:53,810
Oh shit.

7615
06:11:56,010 --> 06:11:58,690
I thought I walked off.

7616
06:11:59,090 --> 06:12:01,110
I thought I walked off.

7617
06:12:06,470 --> 06:12:07,230
Catch.

7618
06:12:07,570 --> 06:12:08,510
I did.

7619
06:12:12,070 --> 06:12:15,290
Like, is this cover or is this death?

7620
06:12:15,870 --> 06:12:16,570
Thank god.

7621
06:12:17,210 --> 06:12:19,830
All me good players have 0 deaths.

7622
06:12:25,750 --> 06:12:26,270
Whoa.

7623
06:12:32,050 --> 06:12:36,970
You're trying to make football references to an Overwatch pro.

7624
06:12:38,590 --> 06:12:39,190
Damn.

7625
06:12:39,650 --> 06:12:42,010
He has a life outside of Overwatch?

7626
06:12:42,290 --> 06:12:42,990
That's crazy.

7627
06:12:43,790 --> 06:12:45,110
And Marvel Rivals now?

7628
06:12:45,650 --> 06:12:47,550
Oh my god, I am Stroud now.

7629
06:12:48,070 --> 06:12:48,830
I fucking did it.

7630
06:12:48,910 --> 06:12:50,050
Guys, I told you.

7631
06:12:50,430 --> 06:12:54,350
I told you I ended up adopting players just like Stroud.

7632
06:12:54,470 --> 06:12:55,190
I did it.

7633
06:12:55,190 --> 06:12:57,930
I don't need millions of dollars.

7634
06:12:58,130 --> 06:13:01,810
I just need a stream Marvel Rivals and they'll come.

7635
06:13:05,350 --> 06:13:07,170
We fucking did it.

7636
06:13:07,790 --> 06:13:10,390
And we adopted a rank 1 player.

7637
06:13:11,910 --> 06:13:13,530
We did the impossible.

7638
06:13:13,910 --> 06:13:15,430
Oh my god, I'm fucking too calm.

7639
06:13:15,570 --> 06:13:16,590
I'm not locked in anymore.

7640
06:13:17,170 --> 06:13:19,010
I'm not locked in.

7641
06:13:20,730 --> 06:13:22,110
Don't never peek that.

7642
06:13:22,850 --> 06:13:24,650
Oh, he never misses.

7643
06:13:25,150 --> 06:13:27,170
Nah, he misses.

7644
06:13:34,210 --> 06:13:36,830
Is my ult on?

7645
06:13:37,050 --> 06:13:37,990
My ult is on.

7646
06:13:38,210 --> 06:13:38,850
That's good.

7647
06:13:44,640 --> 06:13:45,540
Jesus Christ.

7648
06:13:45,880 --> 06:13:46,320
Stop.

7649
06:13:48,540 --> 06:13:51,560
Oh, it doesn't matter.

7650
06:13:51,560 --> 06:13:53,140
It doesn't matter.

7651
06:13:56,180 --> 06:13:57,600
Oh my god.

7652
06:13:58,380 --> 06:13:59,440
Oh, that's cool.

7653
06:13:59,820 --> 06:14:00,080
Sleep!

7654
06:14:00,720 --> 06:14:01,360
It didn't hit.

7655
06:14:03,460 --> 06:14:05,340
It's the thought that counts, you know?

7656
06:14:09,130 --> 06:14:09,730
Damage.

7657
06:14:11,350 --> 06:14:11,950
Jeez.

7658
06:14:17,360 --> 06:14:17,620
Alright.

7659
06:14:19,640 --> 06:14:20,240
Nice.

7660
06:14:21,260 --> 06:14:21,920
What's over there?

7661
06:14:22,080 --> 06:14:22,200
Oh.

7662
06:14:22,960 --> 06:14:23,520
Thank you.

7663
06:14:23,520 --> 06:14:25,520
We just cap point?!

7664
06:14:26,260 --> 06:14:26,860
I already have another.

7665
06:14:27,620 --> 06:14:28,760
I have another ult.

7666
06:14:31,260 --> 06:14:31,620
Alright.

7667
06:14:34,160 --> 06:14:35,100
Damage boost.

7668
06:14:35,260 --> 06:14:35,880
Damage boost.

7669
06:14:37,040 --> 06:14:37,920
Everything's fine.

7670
06:14:38,660 --> 06:14:38,980
Portal?

7671
06:14:40,320 --> 06:14:41,680
Where could it go?

7672
06:14:45,330 --> 06:14:45,750
Oh.

7673
06:14:49,290 --> 06:14:50,450
Where is it?

7674
06:14:50,450 --> 06:14:52,270
Oh.

7675
06:14:53,850 --> 06:14:54,770
Oh.

7676
06:14:56,070 --> 06:14:56,530
Goodbye.

7677
06:15:01,110 --> 06:15:02,030
Oh,

7678
06:15:05,220 --> 06:15:06,600
Strange is solo.

7679
06:15:08,340 --> 06:15:09,560
I'm solo.

7680
06:15:09,720 --> 06:15:10,180
I'm solo.

7681
06:15:10,660 --> 06:15:11,540
No, you're not.

7682
06:15:13,340 --> 06:15:14,180
Thank you, Doki.

7683
06:15:15,940 --> 06:15:16,580
Oh.

7684
06:15:16,880 --> 06:15:17,660
I'm dead.

7685
06:15:21,020 --> 06:15:21,740
Oh my god.

7686
06:15:21,740 --> 06:15:23,140
I sacrificed myself.

7687
06:15:23,560 --> 06:15:25,960
Oh, that was insane!

7688
06:15:28,720 --> 06:15:29,980
I got shielded.

7689
06:15:32,200 --> 06:15:33,560
I got slept.

7690
06:15:33,920 --> 06:15:35,060
How did they see me?

7691
06:15:35,560 --> 06:15:37,160
Okay, I have ult.

7692
06:15:37,760 --> 06:15:39,080
I have ult now.

7693
06:15:39,300 --> 06:15:39,900
It's fine.

7694
06:15:43,670 --> 06:15:44,310
It's okay.

7695
06:15:44,310 --> 06:15:44,730
It's okay.

7696
06:15:49,020 --> 06:15:51,780
Oh my god, my cover.

7697
06:15:52,580 --> 06:15:53,440
He'll be fine.

7698
06:15:54,500 --> 06:15:55,840
I can get one shot though.

7699
06:15:57,900 --> 06:15:59,660
Oh my god, I'm on my cover again.

7700
06:15:59,760 --> 06:16:00,700
I shot my own cover.

7701
06:16:02,760 --> 06:16:06,680
Third person is so fucking wonky sometimes when it comes to like...

7702
06:16:06,680 --> 06:16:11,080
Because when you're too close to something, it like...

7703
06:16:11,080 --> 06:16:12,240
Oh my god, he never missed, guys.

7704
06:16:13,020 --> 06:16:15,900
If you shoot it too close, it doesn't like count.

7705
06:16:17,660 --> 06:16:18,540
Did I get it off?

7706
06:16:18,860 --> 06:16:20,100
Yes, we're all so close to each other.

7707
06:16:20,240 --> 06:16:21,880
We're all so close, but we're dead.

7708
06:16:25,300 --> 06:16:29,440
Oh my god, I didn't have my sleep because I was too busy trying to keep other people alive.

7709
06:16:31,280 --> 06:16:32,680
Oh no, he's one!

7710
06:16:37,960 --> 06:16:39,040
We can do it.

7711
06:16:39,300 --> 06:16:40,780
I believe they just had a...

7712
06:16:40,780 --> 06:16:42,120
We have another... Oh.

7713
06:16:43,000 --> 06:16:43,660
Oh no.

7714
06:16:44,800 --> 06:16:49,400
I'm just gonna stay here until it's too late, which is now.

7715
06:16:53,020 --> 06:16:54,900
Don't worry, he's sleeping.

7716
06:16:55,340 --> 06:16:56,380
I'm worried a little bit.

7717
06:16:58,540 --> 06:17:00,480
What is that sound?

7718
06:17:08,970 --> 06:17:11,130
I can't... It's like...

7719
06:17:13,730 --> 06:17:14,690
Nice.

7720
06:17:25,950 --> 06:17:27,790
We're so fine.

7721
06:17:27,930 --> 06:17:28,990
I can stay up here.

7722
06:17:36,440 --> 06:17:37,800
Come on!

7723
06:17:40,820 --> 06:17:42,600
Come on!

7724
06:17:45,600 --> 06:17:46,560
Yes!

7725
06:17:47,200 --> 06:17:48,660
Nobody knew I was here.

7726
06:17:49,760 --> 06:17:51,960
I got to chill down up here.

7727
06:17:53,560 --> 06:17:54,020
Yippee!

7728
06:17:54,940 --> 06:17:56,240
I got to get back up there.

7729
06:17:56,300 --> 06:17:57,240
That was so nice.

7730
06:17:57,860 --> 06:17:58,900
I actually just chilled.

7731
06:18:01,200 --> 06:18:02,420
Portal, portal, portal, portal.

7732
06:18:02,700 --> 06:18:03,780
Oh no, not again.

7733
06:18:07,140 --> 06:18:08,060
Not again.

7734
06:18:12,350 --> 06:18:13,270
Not again.

7735
06:18:17,090 --> 06:18:17,890
Back, back, back.

7736
06:18:17,890 --> 06:18:18,610
Go, go, go, go.

7737
06:18:18,610 --> 06:18:19,190
Back, back, back.

7738
06:18:19,630 --> 06:18:21,530
Oh my god, not again.

7739
06:18:22,790 --> 06:18:23,070
Oh!

7740
06:18:33,110 --> 06:18:33,890
That's fine.

7741
06:18:40,360 --> 06:18:40,880
Nice.

7742
06:18:45,380 --> 06:18:46,840
Oh my god, you bitch.

7743
06:18:48,140 --> 06:18:49,180
You bitch.

7744
06:18:55,550 --> 06:18:56,190
Magneto, nice.

7745
06:18:57,430 --> 06:18:58,290
There's a Magneto.

7746
06:19:01,490 --> 06:19:01,990
Yay!

7747
06:19:03,690 --> 06:19:04,690
I...

7748
06:19:05,970 --> 06:19:08,910
Fuck that Mantis, actually.

7749
06:19:13,540 --> 06:19:15,340
Oh my god.

7750
06:19:16,820 --> 06:19:18,580
Oh my god, we're getting closer.

7751
06:19:19,720 --> 06:19:21,320
We're actually...

7752
06:19:21,320 --> 06:19:23,340
Getting closer.

7753
06:19:24,040 --> 06:19:24,680
Actually, no.

7754
06:19:24,680 --> 06:19:26,620
I've been like...

7755
06:19:26,620 --> 06:19:29,400
Just to slowly kill what I'm next to.

7756
06:19:29,640 --> 06:19:29,920
What?

7757
06:19:33,320 --> 06:19:34,700
That's rough.

7758
06:19:38,660 --> 06:19:44,680
That's the punisher you made me in front of.

7759
06:19:45,080 --> 06:19:45,900
It's karma.

7760
06:19:55,720 --> 06:19:56,960
That's rough.

7761
06:19:56,960 --> 06:19:58,380
That's pretty rough.

7762
06:20:00,800 --> 06:20:02,900
Oh wait, it's the remedy yet.

7763
06:20:03,140 --> 06:20:05,300
Oh my gosh, my fucking knuckles popped there.

7764
06:20:06,840 --> 06:20:07,620
Guys, please.

7765
06:20:08,020 --> 06:20:08,760
I can't.

7766
06:20:09,280 --> 06:20:10,540
We're so close.

7767
06:20:11,060 --> 06:20:14,340
We're not, but I like to be hopeful for a little bit.

7768
06:20:15,460 --> 06:20:15,900
Oh, it's him.

7769
06:20:18,840 --> 06:20:20,660
Please don't ban Psylocke.

7770
06:20:20,780 --> 06:20:22,120
I'm the really good Psylocke player.

7771
06:20:22,240 --> 06:20:22,640
Ban Hulk.

7772
06:20:23,260 --> 06:20:24,580
Please don't do it.

7773
06:20:25,840 --> 06:20:26,860
Hulk ban.

7774
06:20:27,280 --> 06:20:27,780
Hulk ban.

7775
06:20:28,200 --> 06:20:29,860
I'm the Psylocke player.

7776
06:20:30,080 --> 06:20:31,280
We're banning you.

7777
06:20:32,560 --> 06:20:33,840
Psylocke, please.

7778
06:20:35,320 --> 06:20:36,820
Please, I beg of you.

7779
06:20:36,920 --> 06:20:38,300
Make it not a 50-50.

7780
06:20:38,680 --> 06:20:39,660
Thank you.

7781
06:20:39,800 --> 06:20:41,380
I got you.

7782
06:20:42,640 --> 06:20:44,220
It didn't matter.

7783
06:20:44,420 --> 06:20:45,580
At least it wasn't my team.

7784
06:20:45,880 --> 06:20:48,160
It didn't matter anyway.

7785
06:20:49,120 --> 06:20:50,700
It didn't fucking matter.

7786
06:20:50,700 --> 06:20:51,440
It didn't matter.

7787
06:20:52,820 --> 06:20:53,580
Punisher.

7788
06:20:54,240 --> 06:20:55,000
Winter Soldier.

7789
06:20:55,460 --> 06:20:56,040
Ban Punisher.

7790
06:21:00,720 --> 06:21:02,880
Come on, 25%.

7791
06:21:02,880 --> 06:21:04,060
Come on, 20%.

7792
06:21:04,840 --> 06:21:05,600
Punisher.

7793
06:21:05,960 --> 06:21:06,340
Hulk.

7794
06:21:06,560 --> 06:21:08,660
Yo, there's no fucking way.

7795
06:21:08,920 --> 06:21:10,740
My strongest fucking mace to the face.

7796
06:21:11,180 --> 06:21:14,080
This is fine.

7797
06:21:14,240 --> 06:21:16,420
I can play other characters, man.

7798
06:21:20,760 --> 06:21:22,720
Do we even have...

7799
06:21:22,720 --> 06:21:24,220
Is this even a Hawkeye map?

7800
06:21:30,320 --> 06:21:32,560
You depend on...

7801
06:21:33,640 --> 06:21:37,120
When you depend on randoms for heals.

7802
06:21:37,660 --> 06:21:38,520
It's gg's.

7803
06:21:41,460 --> 06:21:43,400
I can play Strange.

7804
06:21:43,640 --> 06:21:44,640
I'm the Strange God.

7805
06:21:45,860 --> 06:21:48,460
Dude, that hero is actually so fucking easy.

7806
06:21:56,040 --> 06:21:57,080
It's gg's.

7807
06:22:00,780 --> 06:22:02,020
The raid boss?

7808
06:22:02,160 --> 06:22:03,080
Oh shit, yeah.

7809
06:22:03,740 --> 06:22:04,740
You'll never die.

7810
06:22:05,060 --> 06:22:06,120
Heroes never die.

7811
06:22:07,920 --> 06:22:09,060
Is Mace that well known?

7812
06:22:09,240 --> 06:22:10,240
I mean, he is rank 1.

7813
06:22:11,820 --> 06:22:13,400
I guess that's why he's so well known.

7814
06:22:14,560 --> 06:22:17,120
The glaze goes crazy.

7815
06:22:17,960 --> 06:22:18,620
I'm just like...

7816
06:22:18,620 --> 06:22:19,800
I was so oblivious.

7817
06:22:20,420 --> 06:22:21,160
To all of this.

7818
06:22:25,360 --> 06:22:26,180
I just was like...

7819
06:22:26,180 --> 06:22:27,700
Another person to play with me.

7820
06:22:27,720 --> 06:22:28,520
I'm so happy.

7821
06:22:30,820 --> 06:22:31,600
That's really it.

7822
06:22:31,600 --> 06:22:33,080
I just like simple things.

7823
06:22:33,200 --> 06:22:35,720
And then the other person was literally the rank 1.

7824
06:22:41,870 --> 06:22:42,950
You'll never die.

7825
06:22:43,010 --> 06:22:44,730
Okay, you'll maybe die like once or twice.

7826
06:22:44,850 --> 06:22:46,730
I'm not here to give you...

7827
06:22:46,730 --> 06:22:47,850
Oh my god.

7828
06:22:47,850 --> 06:22:48,950
Already...

7829
06:22:48,950 --> 06:22:51,450
Wait, what is being thrown at us?

7830
06:22:52,510 --> 06:22:53,510
Right now.

7831
06:22:53,950 --> 06:22:55,950
Oh, it's the fucking Iron Man.

7832
06:22:56,150 --> 06:22:57,610
I was like so confused.

7833
06:23:00,230 --> 06:23:00,990
Okay, the...

7834
06:23:00,990 --> 06:23:02,150
The strange can die.

7835
06:23:05,450 --> 06:23:06,810
Oh damn.

7836
06:23:13,130 --> 06:23:14,490
Oh shit.

7837
06:23:14,490 --> 06:23:16,790
Oh, he's playing deep.

7838
06:23:18,550 --> 06:23:19,710
Wow.

7839
06:23:26,450 --> 06:23:26,710
Please.

7840
06:23:27,790 --> 06:23:28,790
Any picks.

7841
06:23:29,230 --> 06:23:30,530
Any at all.

7842
06:23:32,130 --> 06:23:33,570
It'll be so cool.

7843
06:23:34,750 --> 06:23:35,370
Any...

7844
06:23:35,370 --> 06:23:37,770
Yes, a pick.

7845
06:23:43,930 --> 06:23:45,290
Oh my god.

7846
06:23:45,290 --> 06:23:46,290
Oh my god.

7847
06:23:46,290 --> 06:23:48,670
He's like deep in there.

7848
06:23:48,870 --> 06:23:50,110
How did he get there?

7849
06:23:51,120 --> 06:23:52,910
How did you get there?

7850
06:23:53,870 --> 06:23:58,320
I don't even know how he got there.

7851
06:24:00,820 --> 06:24:02,760
Alright, this is where I...

7852
06:24:04,520 --> 06:24:06,040
No max for you.

7853
06:24:13,590 --> 06:24:15,060
No, no, no!

7854
06:24:15,660 --> 06:24:16,360
No!

7855
06:24:18,120 --> 06:24:19,380
Where do I go?

7856
06:24:19,800 --> 06:24:21,180
I should've...

7857
06:24:21,180 --> 06:24:22,240
I'm frozen!

7858
06:24:28,060 --> 06:24:29,920
Oh my god.

7859
06:24:34,980 --> 06:24:36,220
That's fine.

7860
06:24:36,920 --> 06:24:38,360
Every time...

7861
06:24:41,860 --> 06:24:43,360
Don't worry, Mace.

7862
06:24:43,360 --> 06:24:45,880
You're not dying on me this time.

7863
06:24:46,680 --> 06:24:49,660
But if you die, I guess you're just bad, I guess.

7864
06:24:49,760 --> 06:24:50,180
I don't know.

7865
06:24:52,500 --> 06:24:53,740
We all get one, though.

7866
06:24:54,380 --> 06:24:56,100
I could let him die right here, right now.

7867
06:24:56,740 --> 06:24:58,520
I could throw right now.

7868
06:25:00,120 --> 06:25:01,260
It's so tempting.

7869
06:25:03,440 --> 06:25:05,640
Literally, I could literally do it right here.

7870
06:25:08,520 --> 06:25:09,640
Did she kill anybody?

7871
06:25:11,120 --> 06:25:12,260
Oh, she did.

7872
06:25:15,000 --> 06:25:17,460
I don't know who I froze, but like...

7873
06:25:17,460 --> 06:25:18,240
He's frozen.

7874
06:25:19,820 --> 06:25:20,800
Oh, Mace.

7875
06:25:21,560 --> 06:25:22,780
I'm jumping.

7876
06:25:23,300 --> 06:25:26,160
I'm jumping as far as I can.

7877
06:25:31,780 --> 06:25:32,740
That's fine.

7878
06:25:32,900 --> 06:25:34,700
I can't see anything, but that's okay.

7879
06:25:36,840 --> 06:25:37,360
I...

7880
06:25:37,360 --> 06:25:40,200
Where am I?

7881
06:25:40,800 --> 06:25:42,240
Okay, I'm gonna break the windows.

7882
06:25:42,700 --> 06:25:43,420
There we go.

7883
06:25:43,720 --> 06:25:44,100
See?

7884
06:25:44,700 --> 06:25:45,440
Everything's fine.

7885
06:25:46,200 --> 06:25:47,880
Okay, I just need to not heal Scarlet Witch.

7886
06:25:47,980 --> 06:25:49,840
And then he'll be the only one with zero deaths.

7887
06:25:54,200 --> 06:25:55,340
Oh, that didn't hit?

7888
06:25:55,800 --> 06:25:56,200
Goddammit.

7889
06:25:57,060 --> 06:25:57,680
I thought that would hit.

7890
06:26:02,210 --> 06:26:03,010
This is...

7891
06:26:03,470 --> 06:26:05,330
Is this what it's like to have a good tank?

7892
06:26:06,590 --> 06:26:07,470
Oh my god.

7893
06:26:07,550 --> 06:26:08,790
Am I doing this wrong?

7894
06:26:08,970 --> 06:26:10,350
Do I just play with tank players?

7895
06:26:10,350 --> 06:26:12,990
Like, is DPS out and tank is in?

7896
06:26:16,190 --> 06:26:17,950
Is that it?

7897
06:26:19,370 --> 06:26:21,510
I think that's it.

7898
06:26:23,370 --> 06:26:26,510
The key is to just play with a tank player.

7899
06:26:27,170 --> 06:26:27,590
Okay.

7900
06:26:27,950 --> 06:26:29,250
I can't save that.

7901
06:26:29,970 --> 06:26:32,070
It looks like it.

7902
06:26:35,350 --> 06:26:36,030
Oh!

7903
06:26:38,310 --> 06:26:38,990
Please!

7904
06:26:39,130 --> 06:26:39,950
I'm jumping!

7905
06:26:43,070 --> 06:26:45,930
Jumping actually makes me go slower, but I'm desperate.

7906
06:26:46,750 --> 06:26:48,290
I'm so scared.

7907
06:26:51,190 --> 06:26:52,310
We did it.

7908
06:26:52,830 --> 06:26:53,850
She's dead.

7909
06:26:54,890 --> 06:26:58,150
Now Miss is the only zero deaths as it should be.

7910
06:27:02,750 --> 06:27:03,650
Oh!

7911
06:27:05,850 --> 06:27:06,910
It was a Namor.

7912
06:27:07,490 --> 06:27:07,850
No!

7913
06:27:15,480 --> 06:27:16,550
Oh my god.

7914
06:27:17,770 --> 06:27:19,030
Oh my god.

7915
06:27:20,070 --> 06:27:23,350
He got killed by a Hawkeye, of course.

7916
06:27:25,870 --> 06:27:27,230
Of course.

7917
06:27:28,610 --> 06:27:30,330
It's always a Hawkeye.

7918
06:27:33,830 --> 06:27:34,810
Okay, Scarlet, you can go whenever.

7919
06:27:35,070 --> 06:27:35,270
What?

7920
06:27:41,790 --> 06:27:43,570
Oh shit!

7921
06:27:44,310 --> 06:27:44,630
What?

7922
06:27:45,830 --> 06:27:46,370
What?

7923
06:27:47,030 --> 06:27:48,650
Holy shogun!

7924
06:27:48,970 --> 06:27:50,330
That's overboard.

7925
06:27:51,610 --> 06:27:54,030
That's actually overboard.

7926
06:27:54,770 --> 06:27:55,370
Okay.

7927
06:27:57,570 --> 06:27:59,710
That's a hate crime there.

7928
06:27:59,910 --> 06:28:00,670
It is not.

7929
06:28:00,670 --> 06:28:04,590
The worst part is it only got one person.

7930
06:28:05,030 --> 06:28:07,350
Like, it was actually useless.

7931
06:28:08,670 --> 06:28:10,170
It looked cool.

7932
06:28:10,430 --> 06:28:12,130
It looked really cool.

7933
06:28:12,430 --> 06:28:15,050
But they literally only got one guy.

7934
06:28:15,550 --> 06:28:17,130
No, please.

7935
06:28:17,310 --> 06:28:18,850
I'm so not healthy.

7936
06:28:19,950 --> 06:28:20,890
Bro, guys.

7937
06:28:21,630 --> 06:28:23,970
All that for one guy.

7938
06:28:24,730 --> 06:28:26,370
That's so sad.

7939
06:28:27,070 --> 06:28:27,890
That poor guy.

7940
06:28:31,370 --> 06:28:34,110
That poor fucking guy.

7941
06:28:40,500 --> 06:28:41,140
Oh!

7942
06:28:42,120 --> 06:28:43,100
Yay!

7943
06:28:50,820 --> 06:28:53,320
Wait, did he say Wavy's gonna get eternity?

7944
06:28:57,240 --> 06:29:01,100
The Wavy guy just said...

7945
06:29:01,100 --> 06:29:04,200
Did he just say it's his eternity game?

7946
06:29:09,440 --> 06:29:10,960
Oh no.

7947
06:29:11,120 --> 06:29:13,340
That means I'm gonna avoid that guy.

7948
06:29:15,040 --> 06:29:17,980
Maybe he'll lose the next game.

7949
06:29:19,820 --> 06:29:23,940
He's my competition.

7950
06:29:32,640 --> 06:29:34,440
Oh my god.

7951
06:29:34,440 --> 06:29:34,820
That's right.

7952
06:29:35,000 --> 06:29:36,120
You'll never die.

7953
06:29:36,680 --> 06:29:37,500
This is it.

7954
06:29:37,840 --> 06:29:39,440
Guys, I can't believe it actually happened.

7955
06:29:40,760 --> 06:29:47,980
Maybe I'll bump into somebody who will get the snowflake and then he'll never die.

7956
06:29:48,840 --> 06:29:49,400
This is it.

7957
06:29:49,480 --> 06:29:50,660
I get to live the dream.

7958
06:29:51,200 --> 06:29:53,080
I get to be shrouded for a day.

7959
06:29:53,740 --> 06:29:54,740
I just need one more.

7960
06:29:55,160 --> 06:29:58,520
One more for the dream four stack and then I'll never fall.

7961
06:29:58,520 --> 06:30:02,980
And then maybe I'll even get eternity like 100 RP.

7962
06:30:04,960 --> 06:30:06,560
I just need one more.

7963
06:30:06,780 --> 06:30:09,160
I need to dock one more guy into this.

7964
06:30:09,420 --> 06:30:10,340
One more player.

7965
06:30:13,360 --> 06:30:15,400
Just gotta dock one more player.

7966
06:30:21,390 --> 06:30:23,430
Then it will be the dream.

7967
06:30:26,250 --> 06:30:27,750
No, Mendo got a third stack.

7968
06:30:27,950 --> 06:30:29,370
A three stack already.

7969
06:30:32,810 --> 06:30:36,990
He already replaced Mace but Mace is irreplaceable.

7970
06:30:41,030 --> 06:30:41,910
That's okay.

7971
06:30:46,050 --> 06:30:48,430
I've been losing it since six hours ago.

7972
06:30:48,890 --> 06:30:52,490
Before I even started the stream I've been playing.

7973
06:30:54,090 --> 06:30:55,010
Mack gave up.

7974
06:30:55,590 --> 06:30:56,110
Albert Lele.

7975
06:30:56,310 --> 06:31:01,830
I was doing with Albert Lele and he like he like gave up.

7976
06:31:02,450 --> 06:31:03,470
He was like I can't.

7977
06:31:03,590 --> 06:31:03,990
I'm tired.

7978
06:31:04,450 --> 06:31:05,870
He isn't in it for the actual.

7979
06:31:06,070 --> 06:31:07,430
I'm a fucking grinder.

7980
06:31:13,490 --> 06:31:14,050
See?

7981
06:31:16,250 --> 06:31:17,490
He gave up the grind.

7982
06:31:18,410 --> 06:31:19,830
He's not dedicated like me.

7983
06:31:20,410 --> 06:31:21,750
You never give up.

7984
06:31:24,090 --> 06:31:27,050
I think also support is like less taxing on you mentally.

7985
06:31:27,510 --> 06:31:28,850
Oh no, actually no.

7986
06:31:29,230 --> 06:31:36,910
It's less like mentally draining versus like the other roles.

7987
06:31:37,050 --> 06:31:42,350
Because all I do is like he he left click and then maybe occasionally right click like this.

7988
06:31:47,130 --> 06:31:47,970
Oh god.

7989
06:31:48,290 --> 06:31:48,470
Mace.

7990
06:31:48,770 --> 06:31:49,110
Mace.

7991
06:31:50,350 --> 06:31:52,130
Mace, you're so healthy.

7992
06:31:52,690 --> 06:31:54,430
You're so healthy.

7993
06:31:55,870 --> 06:31:57,070
Oh my god.

7994
06:31:58,270 --> 06:31:58,910
What?

7995
06:31:59,130 --> 06:32:00,790
Yeah, we don't care about that guy.

7996
06:32:04,130 --> 06:32:05,730
Oh my god.

7997
06:32:05,890 --> 06:32:07,250
I'm merry-go-round that.

7998
06:32:07,570 --> 06:32:08,670
Oh my god.

7999
06:32:09,050 --> 06:32:09,750
I'm merry.

8000
06:32:10,290 --> 06:32:13,790
I did a little merry-go-round.

8001
06:32:14,110 --> 06:32:15,310
How did I live?

8002
06:32:16,070 --> 06:32:16,930
I don't know.

8003
06:32:17,710 --> 06:32:18,270
Jesus.

8004
06:32:18,850 --> 06:32:19,390
What?

8005
06:32:25,310 --> 06:32:26,330
Okay, how?

8006
06:32:26,990 --> 06:32:27,630
Okay.

8007
06:32:27,630 --> 06:32:29,610
God damn.

8008
06:32:30,390 --> 06:32:35,430
Oh my god.

8009
06:32:36,130 --> 06:32:36,990
I didn't live.

8010
06:32:39,530 --> 06:32:40,530
Oh no.

8011
06:32:41,310 --> 06:32:42,130
Wait, is he dead?

8012
06:32:43,350 --> 06:32:44,070
Where's Mace?

8013
06:32:45,430 --> 06:32:45,850
That's fine.

8014
06:32:49,870 --> 06:32:52,050
Oh, if I heal you don't know exactly where you are.

8015
06:32:54,270 --> 06:32:54,950
Guys.

8016
06:32:54,950 --> 06:32:55,130
Guys.

8017
06:32:55,790 --> 06:32:56,830
Okay, two deaths.

8018
06:32:57,770 --> 06:33:00,010
This is gonna be the only two deaths he gets.

8019
06:33:03,250 --> 06:33:04,990
Oh my god.

8020
06:33:05,110 --> 06:33:06,570
He is testing me right now.

8021
06:33:06,910 --> 06:33:07,310
He is.

8022
06:33:09,730 --> 06:33:13,410
He is absolutely testing me.

8023
06:33:14,210 --> 06:33:14,690
Please.

8024
06:33:15,490 --> 06:33:18,950
I don't know if I can keep that promise anymore.

8025
06:33:23,830 --> 06:33:24,190
Nice.

8026
06:33:29,150 --> 06:33:33,910
Like, I just see him fucking, he's still peeking and I'm like, I don't know.

8027
06:33:37,070 --> 06:33:38,310
Oh my god, look back.

8028
06:33:38,410 --> 06:33:40,270
If I look back and he died, I swear to god.

8029
06:33:42,950 --> 06:33:44,130
I'm gonna die to that Iron Man.

8030
06:33:44,170 --> 06:33:44,850
Oh, I can feel it.

8031
06:33:46,690 --> 06:33:48,530
I can feel it already.

8032
06:33:48,670 --> 06:33:51,670
He's gonna be like, max.

8033
06:33:53,770 --> 06:33:55,450
Oh my god.

8034
06:33:56,370 --> 06:33:58,390
No, he blocks me out.

8035
06:33:59,430 --> 06:34:00,730
I got locked out.

8036
06:34:04,280 --> 06:34:05,260
I got locked out.

8037
06:34:07,960 --> 06:34:10,260
This is fucked up.

8038
06:34:11,020 --> 06:34:12,380
Oh no.

8039
06:34:13,040 --> 06:34:15,000
My life for his.

8040
06:34:15,000 --> 06:34:17,980
Was it even worth it?

8041
06:34:18,620 --> 06:34:21,680
I gave up my life for him.

8042
06:34:21,800 --> 06:34:24,820
He gave up his life for me.

8043
06:34:24,880 --> 06:34:26,200
I chose me.

8044
06:34:34,780 --> 06:34:36,420
Oh my god.

8045
06:34:36,700 --> 06:34:37,520
He exploded.

8046
06:34:40,300 --> 06:34:41,240
I can heal her.

8047
06:34:41,240 --> 06:34:43,800
She's like, in that little ghost form.

8048
06:34:46,020 --> 06:34:47,200
Wait, I can kill him.

8049
06:34:47,660 --> 06:34:48,880
Nevermind, he's getting healed.

8050
06:34:52,120 --> 06:34:53,060
That's fine.

8051
06:34:54,580 --> 06:34:55,200
That's fine.

8052
06:34:56,000 --> 06:34:57,380
Build that fucking circle.

8053
06:35:01,990 --> 06:35:02,310
Oh.

8054
06:35:02,930 --> 06:35:04,290
I dance, I dance.

8055
06:35:05,810 --> 06:35:06,330
Alright.

8056
06:35:06,970 --> 06:35:07,390
Yay!

8057
06:35:09,550 --> 06:35:10,550
Let's go.

8058
06:35:10,550 --> 06:35:12,050
Let's get even closer.

8059
06:35:12,370 --> 06:35:13,210
You know what?

8060
06:35:13,250 --> 06:35:14,130
Oh wait, they have a Hoth.

8061
06:35:14,310 --> 06:35:14,910
Wait, they don't.

8062
06:35:15,250 --> 06:35:18,190
Let's get up close and personal and then I leave.

8063
06:35:20,450 --> 06:35:21,690
And then I leave.

8064
06:35:22,430 --> 06:35:24,350
Oh no, that's not Mace, that's fine.

8065
06:35:24,650 --> 06:35:25,810
He can die if he wants to.

8066
06:35:26,990 --> 06:35:27,510
Oh, he lives.

8067
06:35:28,930 --> 06:35:30,310
He almost just made me to death.

8068
06:35:31,690 --> 06:35:32,850
I can't believe I looked away.

8069
06:35:35,030 --> 06:35:36,190
I looked away.

8070
06:35:36,470 --> 06:35:38,010
I was like, that's fine, he can die.

8071
06:35:38,010 --> 06:35:38,910
I don't care.

8072
06:35:41,050 --> 06:35:42,330
And I was like, wait, I'm a healer.

8073
06:35:43,230 --> 06:35:44,330
Oh my god, he might be goat.

8074
06:35:45,650 --> 06:35:46,970
Can I run around this?

8075
06:35:47,090 --> 06:35:47,970
No, I can't.

8076
06:35:50,130 --> 06:35:50,930
That's just me.

8077
06:35:53,930 --> 06:35:55,470
That was worrisome.

8078
06:35:55,710 --> 06:35:56,210
Right there.

8079
06:35:58,050 --> 06:35:58,770
It's fine.

8080
06:36:00,270 --> 06:36:01,550
We're so healthy.

8081
06:36:03,850 --> 06:36:05,330
That's gonna not hit anybody.

8082
06:36:10,340 --> 06:36:10,960
This is okay.

8083
06:36:14,770 --> 06:36:16,050
This is so fine.

8084
06:36:19,050 --> 06:36:20,350
He can just do that.

8085
06:36:21,230 --> 06:36:23,650
Like, with no consequences at all.

8086
06:36:23,770 --> 06:36:25,770
Just walk up to them and be okay.

8087
06:36:31,850 --> 06:36:33,890
That was my bad.

8088
06:36:34,550 --> 06:36:36,210
That was actually...

8089
06:36:36,210 --> 06:36:38,430
That was my bad.

8090
06:36:42,190 --> 06:36:43,870
I think I caused that.

8091
06:36:49,050 --> 06:36:51,710
That was my bad.

8092
06:36:51,910 --> 06:36:53,490
I shouldn't have said anything.

8093
06:36:54,190 --> 06:36:58,670
I shouldn't have said anything.

8094
06:36:59,910 --> 06:37:00,450
Whoops.

8095
06:37:05,970 --> 06:37:06,450
Whoops.

8096
06:37:13,650 --> 06:37:14,130
Oh my god.

8097
06:37:24,010 --> 06:37:28,150
He can do that with no consequences.

8098
06:37:28,190 --> 06:37:29,890
Consequences happens.

8099
06:37:30,790 --> 06:37:31,550
There was...

8100
06:37:31,550 --> 06:37:33,130
There was consequences.

8101
06:37:33,970 --> 06:37:35,650
There was...

8102
06:37:36,270 --> 06:37:37,450
There was...

8103
06:37:37,450 --> 06:37:38,110
We saved.

8104
06:37:39,290 --> 06:37:39,850
Saved.

8105
06:37:40,590 --> 06:37:41,650
That's fine.

8106
06:37:41,770 --> 06:37:43,850
We did it.

8107
06:37:48,930 --> 06:37:49,850
Guys, no.

8108
06:37:50,070 --> 06:37:51,830
I don't know if I can believe yet.

8109
06:37:52,250 --> 06:37:53,390
I don't know, man.

8110
06:37:53,810 --> 06:37:55,190
I don't know.

8111
06:37:56,190 --> 06:37:57,390
10 death Ruben?

8112
06:37:57,690 --> 06:37:58,250
Damn.

8113
06:37:58,830 --> 06:37:59,990
Damn Ruben.

8114
06:38:01,110 --> 06:38:02,160
10 deaths?

8115
06:38:02,160 --> 06:38:02,440
10 deaths?

8116
06:38:09,000 --> 06:38:09,960
Damn.

8117
06:38:10,880 --> 06:38:12,100
That's rough.

8118
06:38:13,160 --> 06:38:15,620
I'm making hella space.

8119
06:38:18,820 --> 06:38:19,960
I don't know, guys.

8120
06:38:21,320 --> 06:38:22,300
Kinda rough.

8121
06:38:22,960 --> 06:38:23,800
Kinda rough for him.

8122
06:38:26,200 --> 06:38:28,020
Anything can happen for me.

8123
06:38:28,020 --> 06:38:30,560
I've been, like, in this hellhole of a rank.

8124
06:38:30,960 --> 06:38:31,820
Anything can happen.

8125
06:38:32,840 --> 06:38:35,920
I've gotten stream sniped so many times.

8126
06:38:36,160 --> 06:38:36,420
I've gotten stream sniped so many times.

8127
06:38:36,420 --> 06:38:37,720
That's why I mostly play off stream.

8128
06:38:38,320 --> 06:38:39,400
But today I feel brave.

8129
06:38:39,440 --> 06:38:40,560
Like, who wants to stream snipe me?

8130
06:38:41,260 --> 06:38:42,800
Unless they want to fire me, I guess.

8131
06:38:43,180 --> 06:38:47,380
I got stream sniped because people wanted to fire me.

8132
06:38:47,460 --> 06:38:47,900
I'm like, please.

8133
06:38:48,720 --> 06:38:49,180
I'm like, please.

8134
06:38:52,540 --> 06:38:53,500
No, like...

8135
06:38:53,500 --> 06:38:56,380
My friend was like, you should put a delay.

8136
06:38:56,380 --> 06:38:57,640
But I'm like...

8137
06:38:58,240 --> 06:39:00,880
I don't want to put a delay because I like talking to chat.

8138
06:39:02,120 --> 06:39:04,680
Yeah, we will just win.

8139
06:39:06,760 --> 06:39:07,640
It's like...

8140
06:39:07,640 --> 06:39:09,340
Oh my god, no, it's crazy.

8141
06:39:09,880 --> 06:39:11,900
And now I play with so many guitar bands.

8142
06:39:14,820 --> 06:39:16,560
Yeah, who would stream snipe Mace?

8143
06:39:16,720 --> 06:39:17,160
Exactly.

8144
06:39:18,120 --> 06:39:19,140
Mace would just, like...

8145
06:39:19,140 --> 06:39:22,000
Mace would, like, take your ELO in his actual main account.

8146
06:39:22,260 --> 06:39:23,180
He would make a hit list.

8147
06:39:27,360 --> 06:39:27,840
He would make a hit list.

8148
06:39:27,840 --> 06:39:28,900
Well, now I didn't rank.

8149
06:39:29,280 --> 06:39:32,760
That's why I haven't stream ranked in so long.

8150
06:39:33,560 --> 06:39:35,980
Oh, there is a hit list?

8151
06:39:36,220 --> 06:39:37,920
Oh shit, am I on the hit list?

8152
06:39:48,360 --> 06:39:51,100
Oh my god, am I on a hit list?

8153
06:39:55,800 --> 06:39:57,340
Please don't ban Psylocke.

8154
06:39:57,440 --> 06:39:58,520
That's my character.

8155
06:39:58,820 --> 06:40:00,320
This guy is just being stupid.

8156
06:40:02,300 --> 06:40:04,120
You're not going to listen to me.

8157
06:40:05,520 --> 06:40:08,320
Where do I ban Strange?

8158
06:40:09,100 --> 06:40:09,700
Don't.

8159
06:40:28,080 --> 06:40:31,460
I didn't think it would happen.

8160
06:40:32,100 --> 06:40:34,340
I didn't think it would happen.

8161
06:40:39,700 --> 06:40:40,200
That was 20%!

8162
06:40:41,080 --> 06:40:43,020
That was 20%!

8163
06:40:43,840 --> 06:40:45,380
I don't fucking know.

8164
06:40:45,520 --> 06:40:46,400
I didn't learn.

8165
06:40:47,040 --> 06:40:48,760
I didn't learn.

8166
06:40:56,940 --> 06:41:07,280
I'm not a two trick.

8167
06:41:07,280 --> 06:41:09,280
I'm not a two trick, okay?

8168
06:41:13,500 --> 06:41:29,000
I can learn.

8169
06:41:29,260 --> 06:41:29,820
I can learn.

8170
06:41:30,120 --> 06:41:31,600
I'm sorry.

8171
06:41:33,140 --> 06:41:34,720
I didn't realize.

8172
06:41:37,280 --> 06:41:39,360
I didn't know.

8173
06:41:54,440 --> 06:41:58,460
How was I supposed to know it was 20%?

8174
06:41:58,840 --> 06:42:02,520
I just wanted to go gambling.

8175
06:42:07,280 --> 06:42:08,060
I just wanted to go gambling.

8176
06:42:11,080 --> 06:42:13,660
I'm so sorry.

8177
06:42:14,720 --> 06:42:16,460
I'm sorry, babe.

8178
06:42:17,920 --> 06:42:21,500
Okay, what is this comp?

8179
06:42:23,300 --> 06:42:25,520
Let's go gambling.

8180
06:42:26,360 --> 06:42:33,020
Let's go gambling.

8181
06:42:33,020 --> 06:42:36,080
There's enough things to run ghosts?

8182
06:42:36,320 --> 06:42:37,700
We have three in support.

8183
06:42:41,520 --> 06:42:42,660
Oh my god.

8184
06:42:42,780 --> 06:42:45,400
As long as you're alive, that's all that matters.

8185
06:42:50,700 --> 06:42:52,140
Help our guy.

8186
06:42:52,360 --> 06:42:53,140
Our Mantis guy.

8187
06:42:54,420 --> 06:42:56,380
We kept America solo.

8188
06:42:57,780 --> 06:42:59,480
Yeah, I just got to do everything apparently.

8189
06:42:59,480 --> 06:43:03,040
Oh yeah, who's keeping you alive right now?

8190
06:43:03,120 --> 06:43:03,900
Who's keeping you alive?

8191
06:43:07,680 --> 06:43:08,120
Hey,

8192
06:43:13,820 --> 06:43:15,860
you got Groot, right?

8193
06:43:16,300 --> 06:43:17,480
I am Groot.

8194
06:43:29,480 --> 06:43:30,380
I am Groot.

8195
06:43:33,320 --> 06:43:35,020
Groot, Groot, Groot.

8196
06:43:35,360 --> 06:43:38,520
Okay, how am I supposed to kill anyone with this fucking old man?

8197
06:43:38,620 --> 06:43:39,540
I am Groot.

8198
06:43:41,540 --> 06:43:43,180
I am Groot.

8199
06:43:46,020 --> 06:43:46,740
Ah, yeah.

8200
06:43:53,700 --> 06:43:54,900
I am Groot.

8201
06:43:56,120 --> 06:43:56,800
I am Groot.

8202
06:43:59,480 --> 06:44:01,000
This is so strange, I'm so confused.

8203
06:44:02,120 --> 06:44:02,600
I am Groot.

8204
06:44:05,260 --> 06:44:07,300
Why would anybody do that?

8205
06:44:08,500 --> 06:44:09,880
I just want to get a Pokemon.

8206
06:44:10,560 --> 06:44:12,380
I am Groot, I am Groot, I am Groot.

8207
06:44:14,300 --> 06:44:16,660
You got America to her right on her lowkey.

8208
06:44:17,360 --> 06:44:18,440
Ah, yeah.

8209
06:44:20,660 --> 06:44:21,860
Is Groot fun to play?

8210
06:44:23,500 --> 06:44:24,760
Uh, I am Groot.

8211
06:44:25,660 --> 06:44:27,000
There we go.

8212
06:44:27,000 --> 06:44:32,750
You've done something as crazy as that.

8213
06:44:33,590 --> 06:44:34,750
That's like crazy.

8214
06:44:35,590 --> 06:44:37,130
We're literally at their spot.

8215
06:44:37,750 --> 06:44:40,870
We're at their fucking spot.

8216
06:44:42,650 --> 06:44:44,030
This guy is just a goat.

8217
06:44:45,250 --> 06:44:46,090
I am Groot.

8218
06:44:46,190 --> 06:44:47,590
I am Groot.

8219
06:44:47,790 --> 06:44:49,550
Why is it me not in the right map?

8220
06:44:50,890 --> 06:44:56,190
Anybody that's playing Marvel Rivals at 7 in the morning, nobody is okay right now.

8221
06:44:56,190 --> 06:44:57,070
Good boy.

8222
06:44:57,150 --> 06:44:58,170
Are you okay?

8223
06:45:01,980 --> 06:45:02,470
Yay!

8224
06:45:05,840 --> 06:45:06,810
I am Groot.

8225
06:45:08,850 --> 06:45:10,490
I am Groot.

8226
06:45:12,190 --> 06:45:16,170
Look at these off meta picks, they're so brave.

8227
06:45:20,160 --> 06:45:20,650
No.

8228
06:45:20,650 --> 06:45:20,790
No.

8229
06:45:22,450 --> 06:45:25,930
No, I am so okay.

8230
06:45:35,450 --> 06:45:39,350
Wait, is this your eternity game?

8231
06:45:40,650 --> 06:45:41,690
No, next game is.

8232
06:45:41,890 --> 06:45:43,310
Okay, Mace, can you avoid him?

8233
06:45:50,750 --> 06:45:52,590
I am Groot.

8234
06:45:54,850 --> 06:45:56,430
Blowing the cover.

8235
06:45:56,950 --> 06:46:03,930
Please stop.

8236
06:46:09,250 --> 06:46:11,250
I would never.

8237
06:46:14,770 --> 06:46:18,570
I would never do something that fucked up, guys.

8238
06:46:18,570 --> 06:46:19,970
Like batting stream.

8239
06:46:20,110 --> 06:46:22,050
That's something I would never do.

8240
06:46:24,550 --> 06:46:26,470
Jesus Christ.

8241
06:46:30,570 --> 06:46:32,490
My God.

8242
06:46:33,370 --> 06:46:34,730
What was that?

8243
06:46:37,570 --> 06:46:39,650
What the fuck was that?

8244
06:46:41,270 --> 06:46:43,790
Careful, he has the list.

8245
06:46:44,650 --> 06:46:45,090
True.

8246
06:46:45,690 --> 06:46:47,330
Oh no, I'm gonna get on the list.

8247
06:46:48,330 --> 06:46:50,190
I'm gonna get on the fucking list.

8248
06:46:50,690 --> 06:46:50,970
Yes.

8249
06:46:52,070 --> 06:46:53,990
There's no way he would never do such a thing.

8250
06:46:56,090 --> 06:46:57,650
Oh my God.

8251
06:46:58,110 --> 06:46:59,110
Please, no.

8252
06:47:04,950 --> 06:47:06,670
Wait, I died?

8253
06:47:10,530 --> 06:47:13,290
Okay, no, I don't want to be on the list.

8254
06:47:13,790 --> 06:47:15,250
Don't put me on the list.

8255
06:47:15,470 --> 06:47:17,310
I swear I won't do that again.

8256
06:47:17,550 --> 06:47:18,030
I swear.

8257
06:47:18,290 --> 06:47:23,230
Okay, him not dying should exempt me from getting on the list.

8258
06:47:23,810 --> 06:47:25,890
Guys, I'm gonna say that.

8259
06:47:26,010 --> 06:47:28,090
I'm gonna say him not dying.

8260
06:47:29,450 --> 06:47:30,750
Him not dying.

8261
06:47:31,410 --> 06:47:32,690
He's still not dead.

8262
06:47:35,190 --> 06:47:37,050
Go, go.

8263
06:47:37,170 --> 06:47:38,110
Jump off, jump off.

8264
06:47:39,190 --> 06:47:40,210
Oh my God.

8265
06:47:40,210 --> 06:47:40,290
What?

8266
06:47:42,870 --> 06:47:43,690
Do it.

8267
06:47:43,870 --> 06:47:44,210
Jump.

8268
06:47:44,350 --> 06:47:45,310
Do a flip.

8269
06:47:46,710 --> 06:47:47,490
Guys, please.

8270
06:47:47,590 --> 06:47:48,870
I don't want to be on the list, guys.

8271
06:47:48,910 --> 06:47:50,650
Please, I worked so hard to be here.

8272
06:47:51,550 --> 06:47:53,750
I adopted so many players, guys.

8273
06:47:55,650 --> 06:47:57,410
I figured it out.

8274
06:48:03,740 --> 06:48:04,260
Alright.

8275
06:48:05,260 --> 06:48:05,740
That's fine.

8276
06:48:06,060 --> 06:48:07,100
We're so okay.

8277
06:48:07,100 --> 06:48:08,680
We're so okay.

8278
06:48:10,560 --> 06:48:12,880
I don't know why I tried to beat up our own tree.

8279
06:48:13,680 --> 06:48:14,400
Wait, where did he go?

8280
06:48:14,580 --> 06:48:15,080
There he is.

8281
06:48:16,200 --> 06:48:17,880
If he never dies, we win.

8282
06:48:20,080 --> 06:48:20,720
We don't care.

8283
06:48:20,860 --> 06:48:21,860
Oh wait, he lives too.

8284
06:48:27,380 --> 06:48:28,340
Don't worry!

8285
06:48:30,300 --> 06:48:31,260
You live!

8286
06:48:33,100 --> 06:48:35,200
Who cares about everybody else?

8287
06:48:37,100 --> 06:48:38,180
Okay, nice.

8288
06:48:38,600 --> 06:48:39,520
Yay!

8289
06:48:42,940 --> 06:48:44,240
We did it.

8290
06:48:49,740 --> 06:48:52,380
0-0-9 is crazy.

8291
06:48:53,760 --> 06:48:54,500
He's Groot.

8292
06:48:55,160 --> 06:48:56,140
He is Groot.

8293
06:48:58,180 --> 06:48:59,840
Oh my God, look.

8294
06:48:59,980 --> 06:49:00,340
See?

8295
06:49:01,360 --> 06:49:03,200
Look, zero deaths.

8296
06:49:03,860 --> 06:49:04,620
Look at that.

8297
06:49:04,620 --> 06:49:06,940
I'm so not forgiving.

8298
06:49:21,840 --> 06:49:27,780
Oh my God, what's 0-0-9?

8299
06:49:28,780 --> 06:49:29,240
Is it this?

8300
06:49:29,340 --> 06:49:30,400
Oh, 0-9.

8301
06:49:30,660 --> 06:49:31,300
That's crazy.

8302
06:49:32,240 --> 06:49:33,120
That's crazy.

8303
06:49:33,320 --> 06:49:33,860
I've been marked.

8304
06:49:34,020 --> 06:49:35,860
No, guys, don't say that.

8305
06:49:36,100 --> 06:49:37,720
I don't want to be on the list, guys.

8306
06:49:47,040 --> 06:49:47,940
Don't say that.

8307
06:49:48,040 --> 06:49:50,840
No, please.

8308
06:49:51,360 --> 06:49:51,820
Please.

8309
06:49:54,220 --> 06:49:57,400
Just a humble support player.

8310
06:49:58,460 --> 06:49:58,940
Please.

8311
06:49:58,940 --> 06:49:59,060
Please.

8312
06:49:59,620 --> 06:50:01,260
What did I do to deserve it?

8313
06:50:01,360 --> 06:50:03,040
What did I even do?

8314
06:50:03,160 --> 06:50:04,340
I don't understand.

8315
06:50:05,240 --> 06:50:07,800
What could I have done to deserve it?

8316
06:50:13,420 --> 06:50:15,000
Oh yeah, should I do it?

8317
06:50:18,540 --> 06:50:21,800
What if I just avoided the wavy guy?

8318
06:50:22,240 --> 06:50:23,080
Right now.

8319
06:50:24,640 --> 06:50:25,760
Oh, he's not even...

8320
06:50:25,760 --> 06:50:28,480
Oh, I didn't even have to avoid him.

8321
06:50:29,000 --> 06:50:30,240
Oh my God.

8322
06:50:30,760 --> 06:50:32,480
I didn't even...

8323
06:50:32,480 --> 06:50:35,400
I swear, I didn't even avoid him.

8324
06:50:35,980 --> 06:50:38,000
It was just RNG.

8325
06:50:42,060 --> 06:50:44,140
I swear to God.

8326
06:50:45,380 --> 06:50:46,380
It's over.

8327
06:50:48,200 --> 06:50:50,360
What do you mean, how could I do that?

8328
06:50:50,640 --> 06:50:51,800
I didn't do anything.

8329
06:50:52,120 --> 06:50:52,920
It happened.

8330
06:50:52,920 --> 06:50:54,200
Also, pasta.

8331
06:50:54,420 --> 06:50:55,100
Thank you for the tier one.

8332
06:50:55,240 --> 06:50:57,840
Thank you for the prime.

8333
06:50:58,380 --> 06:50:59,620
Thank you for the tier one.

8334
06:50:59,840 --> 06:51:01,020
Thank you.

8335
06:51:03,220 --> 06:51:04,900
Wait, ban Doctor Strange?

8336
06:51:08,620 --> 06:51:11,180
Oh, now you want to ban...

8337
06:51:11,180 --> 06:51:14,500
Oh, now you want to ban Doctor Strange.

8338
06:51:23,530 --> 06:51:24,530
Do we ban Hela?

8339
06:51:24,530 --> 06:51:26,050
Don't watch them ban Hela.

8340
06:51:26,150 --> 06:51:27,010
They can ban Hela, watch.

8341
06:51:27,890 --> 06:51:28,250
Alright.

8342
06:51:29,150 --> 06:51:32,750
Then I'm banning Bruce Batty.

8343
06:51:35,230 --> 06:51:36,030
Let's flip.

8344
06:51:39,290 --> 06:51:39,650
Oh!

8345
06:51:41,290 --> 06:51:42,070
That's good.

8346
06:51:42,130 --> 06:51:42,850
That's good RNG.

8347
06:51:47,030 --> 06:51:48,230
Guys, I didn't...

8348
06:51:48,230 --> 06:51:49,330
I didn't do it.

8349
06:51:49,550 --> 06:51:50,910
Someone else in my team did it.

8350
06:51:50,910 --> 06:51:53,450
And I think it's definitely not me.

8351
06:51:53,590 --> 06:51:55,110
I definitely... I did not.

8352
06:51:55,270 --> 06:51:57,290
I let him try...

8353
06:51:57,290 --> 06:51:59,430
I thought he was going to be on my team.

8354
06:52:00,070 --> 06:52:01,010
He could have Q dodged.

8355
06:52:01,650 --> 06:52:02,250
He...

8356
06:52:02,250 --> 06:52:04,810
He tried to 50-50 it.

8357
06:52:04,890 --> 06:52:05,730
That's his own fault.

8358
06:52:06,970 --> 06:52:08,390
If he really...

8359
06:52:08,390 --> 06:52:11,190
He tried going gambling and it failed for him.

8360
06:52:14,710 --> 06:52:18,630
Guys, you've only met this guy for two games.

8361
06:52:19,030 --> 06:52:21,790
He didn't talk until the second game.

8362
06:52:22,310 --> 06:52:24,550
And he said three words.

8363
06:52:24,930 --> 06:52:28,030
His first word was, I'm playing Pokemon TCG.

8364
06:52:28,530 --> 06:52:31,470
His second was like, Guys, it's my eternity.

8365
06:52:31,770 --> 06:52:33,250
My turn game is next game.

8366
06:52:35,790 --> 06:52:37,830
I feel like I've known him...

8367
06:52:37,830 --> 06:52:40,590
I've been here for seven hours!

8368
06:52:43,710 --> 06:52:46,910
And you've known him for the rest of your life?

8369
06:52:46,910 --> 06:52:49,570
I would die for Wavy.

8370
06:52:50,510 --> 06:52:51,670
That's all I need to know.

8371
06:52:51,810 --> 06:52:52,790
That he's...

8372
06:52:52,790 --> 06:52:54,870
That this is his eternity game.

8373
06:52:55,150 --> 06:52:55,870
And that you...

8374
06:52:56,850 --> 06:52:59,130
He plays Pokemon TCG.

8375
06:52:59,550 --> 06:53:00,870
He's like a brother for you.

8376
06:53:02,210 --> 06:53:03,270
He's just a little guy.

8377
06:53:03,570 --> 06:53:03,790
Really.

8378
06:53:12,470 --> 06:53:13,030
Psylocke...

8379
06:53:13,030 --> 06:53:14,650
The standard Psylocke and strange.

8380
06:53:14,650 --> 06:53:15,930
Okay.

8381
06:53:16,130 --> 06:53:16,970
Who else?

8382
06:53:18,450 --> 06:53:19,670
That's four already.

8383
06:53:22,850 --> 06:53:25,330
That's what standard means.

8384
06:53:26,010 --> 06:53:27,330
Wait, you're not mace.

8385
06:53:29,010 --> 06:53:29,610
Here we go.

8386
06:53:39,130 --> 06:53:39,490
Okay.

8387
06:53:39,690 --> 06:53:41,070
I don't got enough walls for that.

8388
06:53:44,090 --> 06:53:45,610
I don't have enough walls for you.

8389
06:53:46,130 --> 06:53:48,190
I love this fucking shotgun, bro.

8390
06:53:51,610 --> 06:53:53,010
It's so dumb.

8391
06:53:53,950 --> 06:53:56,450
I love how he's like, I don't have enough walls, what the fuck you want me to do?

8392
06:54:00,070 --> 06:54:02,290
I'm breaking the walls.

8393
06:54:07,960 --> 06:54:09,060
Is Psylocke meta?

8394
06:54:09,200 --> 06:54:09,560
Yes.

8395
06:54:10,520 --> 06:54:11,680
Psylocke is so strong.

8396
06:54:12,160 --> 06:54:14,360
Psylocke is basically Genji in Overwatch.

8397
06:54:14,920 --> 06:54:15,820
It's a Star Lord too, right?

8398
06:54:22,910 --> 06:54:24,550
I'm so happy Luna's not banned.

8399
06:54:24,630 --> 06:54:26,190
Fucking easiest support of my life.

8400
06:54:33,510 --> 06:54:34,150
Never...

8401
06:54:34,150 --> 06:54:35,790
No, Mercy existed, nevermind.

8402
06:54:36,690 --> 06:54:37,070
I see.

8403
06:54:37,930 --> 06:54:39,490
There's no easier character.

8404
06:54:40,170 --> 06:54:42,110
And now it's like, oh wait, Mercy's a character.

8405
06:54:47,130 --> 06:54:48,830
There's a Star Lord behind us still.

8406
06:54:49,250 --> 06:54:49,970
He's low, he's low.

8407
06:54:50,170 --> 06:54:50,450
He's one.

8408
06:55:00,630 --> 06:55:01,070
Yeah,

8409
06:55:06,990 --> 06:55:08,210
Mercy is so easy.

8410
06:55:09,930 --> 06:55:12,590
Oh no, I might anger a lot of people for saying that.

8411
06:55:15,550 --> 06:55:21,050
Compared to other support characters, Mercy is pretty easy.

8412
06:55:26,430 --> 06:55:30,810
I don't want to anger people for saying that.

8413
06:55:37,730 --> 06:55:38,190
Legend.

8414
06:55:39,550 --> 06:55:40,130
Legend.

8415
06:55:41,890 --> 06:55:42,530
Legend.

8416
06:55:46,490 --> 06:55:49,510
Oh, time to keep dancing.

8417
06:55:52,830 --> 06:55:55,210
Okay, they're in the straight line, so I can do this.

8418
06:55:56,550 --> 06:55:58,250
This is the only time I use that.

8419
06:55:59,130 --> 06:55:59,690
Oh my god.

8420
06:56:00,090 --> 06:56:01,350
I froze somebody.

8421
06:56:01,730 --> 06:56:02,690
Oh, that's fine.

8422
06:56:04,410 --> 06:56:05,350
I am Groot.

8423
06:56:05,350 --> 06:56:06,290
That one hurts.

8424
06:56:06,610 --> 06:56:08,170
I'm doing this my way.

8425
06:56:08,750 --> 06:56:10,630
Just chillin' there.

8426
06:56:11,010 --> 06:56:11,830
Oh, okay.

8427
06:56:16,320 --> 06:56:17,480
Oh, shit!

8428
06:56:20,740 --> 06:56:21,880
Oh, nice!

8429
06:56:23,340 --> 06:56:24,740
That's the rank one!

8430
06:56:24,800 --> 06:56:25,880
I know that guy!

8431
06:56:26,060 --> 06:56:27,280
I met him today!

8432
06:56:29,160 --> 06:56:30,880
There's a Star Lord above us.

8433
06:56:31,180 --> 06:56:33,140
Yeah, it's called AppHP behind us.

8434
06:56:37,720 --> 06:56:38,360
Okay.

8435
06:56:38,660 --> 06:56:39,400
It's fine.

8436
06:56:44,520 --> 06:56:47,140
It's so nice not getting pushed by anything.

8437
06:56:47,740 --> 06:56:49,000
I literally just exist.

8438
06:56:52,540 --> 06:56:54,720
So that's why I'm not climbing.

8439
06:56:55,540 --> 06:56:58,200
I just haven't played with a tank player before.

8440
06:56:59,400 --> 06:57:00,660
And also, he's rank one.

8441
06:57:04,420 --> 06:57:04,820
Yeah.

8442
06:57:05,120 --> 06:57:05,940
Yeah, I adopted him today.

8443
06:57:07,400 --> 06:57:08,140
I don't know.

8444
06:57:08,220 --> 06:57:10,400
I don't know if it's because he's a tank player or he's rank.

8445
06:57:10,800 --> 06:57:11,800
It's one or the other.

8446
06:57:17,940 --> 06:57:19,160
Yeah, that's a big part.

8447
06:57:19,640 --> 06:57:21,400
That's also a big part to it.

8448
06:57:23,860 --> 06:57:25,340
It's totally a tank thing, right?

8449
06:57:25,520 --> 06:57:26,520
Yeah, it's a tank thing.

8450
06:57:26,720 --> 06:57:28,840
Guys, it works with any other tank player.

8451
06:57:28,940 --> 06:57:30,080
Adopt a tank player today.

8452
06:57:30,080 --> 06:57:31,880
I'm dead.

8453
06:57:32,240 --> 06:57:35,980
I'm so- That shit went backwards.

8454
06:57:36,320 --> 06:57:37,960
I thought I could get out of the edge there.

8455
06:57:38,680 --> 06:57:39,320
Please, please.

8456
06:57:39,600 --> 06:57:40,680
Don't push up.

8457
06:57:40,780 --> 06:57:43,220
You only have Adam heals.

8458
06:57:44,980 --> 06:57:47,080
Yeah, he's rank one because he's a tank.

8459
06:57:47,260 --> 06:57:47,500
True.

8460
06:57:47,860 --> 06:57:48,380
True.

8461
06:57:48,920 --> 06:57:53,320
Guys, this is my PSA to adopt a tank player today.

8462
06:57:56,080 --> 06:57:57,600
I know that it's a one-hit kill.

8463
06:57:57,600 --> 06:57:58,580
Alright, I can stand still.

8464
06:58:01,740 --> 06:58:03,960
I'm getting lazy now.

8465
06:58:07,400 --> 06:58:08,300
Oh, nice.

8466
06:58:09,320 --> 06:58:11,140
Yo, fuck that one person in particular.

8467
06:58:16,880 --> 06:58:17,480
Yeah.

8468
06:58:20,000 --> 06:58:22,180
Every tank guy is one.

8469
06:58:24,460 --> 06:58:27,900
If you're a healer, always find a good tank.

8470
06:58:28,140 --> 06:58:30,020
Guys, don't adopt a DPS player.

8471
06:58:30,180 --> 06:58:31,380
Adopt a tank player.

8472
06:58:32,280 --> 06:58:32,880
Get ready.

8473
06:58:33,460 --> 06:58:34,980
You're not being lazy.

8474
06:58:35,380 --> 06:58:36,840
You're being efficient.

8475
06:58:40,920 --> 06:58:43,000
Rest in peace, ladies.

8476
06:58:43,400 --> 06:58:49,760
This is my PSA that like, throw your DPS players to the pound.

8477
06:58:50,680 --> 06:58:52,980
Adopt a tank player right now.

8478
06:58:57,960 --> 06:59:01,580
Tribal, Bean, thank you for the tier one sub and the prime sub.

8479
06:59:01,720 --> 06:59:02,460
I appreciate it.

8480
06:59:02,500 --> 06:59:03,280
Thank you, thank you.

8481
06:59:03,360 --> 06:59:04,820
Thank you for the prime sub.

8482
06:59:05,100 --> 06:59:06,400
Thank you for the prime sub.

8483
06:59:06,540 --> 06:59:07,220
Thank you.

8484
06:59:08,640 --> 06:59:10,940
No, don't send it back!

8485
06:59:16,120 --> 06:59:17,080
No comment.

8486
06:59:17,340 --> 06:59:19,020
No comment.

8487
06:59:25,420 --> 06:59:26,400
No comment.

8488
06:59:26,400 --> 06:59:27,460
There were just way too many.

8489
06:59:30,240 --> 06:59:32,700
The Black Panther pick was the last straw.

8490
06:59:38,280 --> 06:59:39,520
I wanna be up here.

8491
06:59:39,880 --> 06:59:41,020
I wanna play up here.

8492
06:59:42,800 --> 06:59:44,980
It was just one too many Black Panthers.

8493
06:59:45,200 --> 06:59:46,580
It only takes one bad day.

8494
06:59:47,540 --> 06:59:50,640
It really only takes one bad day.

8495
06:59:54,600 --> 06:59:55,860
He was weak.

8496
06:59:57,100 --> 06:59:58,660
I was willing to go.

8497
06:59:58,940 --> 07:00:00,500
He was weak.

8498
07:00:00,720 --> 07:00:03,980
I was willing to go all the way till eternity.

8499
07:00:04,520 --> 07:00:06,220
He gave up when we were...

8500
07:00:06,220 --> 07:00:09,080
He could've been part of this.

8501
07:00:09,860 --> 07:00:11,180
He really could've been.

8502
07:00:14,960 --> 07:00:15,960
This could've been.

8503
07:00:16,760 --> 07:00:18,740
This could've been his time.

8504
07:00:18,740 --> 07:00:23,100
Bro, I hear Namor's fucking wet feet.

8505
07:00:24,280 --> 07:00:25,940
Oh, Wavy's low.

8506
07:00:31,700 --> 07:00:33,000
Oh, Punisher's low?

8507
07:00:35,040 --> 07:00:36,220
What the fuck?

8508
07:00:37,300 --> 07:00:42,060
Dude, I was so confused as to who the fuck Wavy was this entire time, man.

8509
07:00:43,140 --> 07:00:43,660
That's fine.

8510
07:00:47,960 --> 07:00:51,000
Oh, thank god that Groot was taking damage.

8511
07:00:51,140 --> 07:00:51,740
Bottom left.

8512
07:00:53,440 --> 07:00:54,500
Thank god.

8513
07:00:54,880 --> 07:00:57,220
Guys, I intentionally dropped down.

8514
07:00:57,860 --> 07:00:58,340
Guys.

8515
07:00:59,700 --> 07:01:02,360
I intentionally dropped down, guys.

8516
07:01:02,620 --> 07:01:04,360
Because I wanted to heal them.

8517
07:01:07,640 --> 07:01:08,940
It was all in.

8518
07:01:09,100 --> 07:01:09,500
What?

8519
07:01:09,580 --> 07:01:09,980
Already?

8520
07:01:12,220 --> 07:01:13,420
There's a Namor up.

8521
07:01:13,560 --> 07:01:14,420
There's Namor top right.

8522
07:01:16,880 --> 07:01:17,320
No.

8523
07:01:17,720 --> 07:01:18,740
Don't make me ult.

8524
07:01:18,820 --> 07:01:19,500
I will ult.

8525
07:01:23,620 --> 07:01:26,090
Jesus Christ, he's still alive.

8526
07:01:32,830 --> 07:01:33,430
I am Groot.

8527
07:01:37,060 --> 07:01:38,240
I am Groot.

8528
07:01:41,200 --> 07:01:42,220
Everybody's okay.

8529
07:01:42,980 --> 07:01:43,700
He's Groot.

8530
07:01:45,980 --> 07:01:46,680
I won't be up here.

8531
07:01:47,400 --> 07:01:48,340
I won't feel tall.

8532
07:01:52,640 --> 07:01:53,680
You're fine.

8533
07:01:53,860 --> 07:01:55,860
I'm gonna find out how much damage the map does.

8534
07:02:00,340 --> 07:02:01,860
I don't need help.

8535
07:02:03,140 --> 07:02:03,840
You know what?

8536
07:02:03,940 --> 07:02:04,360
Look at him.

8537
07:02:04,560 --> 07:02:05,260
Look at him go.

8538
07:02:06,460 --> 07:02:07,620
He's so healthy.

8539
07:02:09,120 --> 07:02:10,320
He's so healthy.

8540
07:02:10,600 --> 07:02:11,400
Look at him go.

8541
07:02:11,580 --> 07:02:12,840
I'm gonna drop down.

8542
07:02:13,080 --> 07:02:15,640
I saw four people went up top.

8543
07:02:16,620 --> 07:02:18,460
I did not feel okay with that.

8544
07:02:22,820 --> 07:02:23,720
There's like two.

8545
07:02:23,980 --> 07:02:25,480
There's like people over at the bot.

8546
07:02:29,000 --> 07:02:32,620
Hey, if you guys wanna fight on point, I'm right here.

8547
07:02:35,840 --> 07:02:38,260
Doki, I need healing up here.

8548
07:02:38,560 --> 07:02:39,320
Not you.

8549
07:02:47,880 --> 07:02:48,680
Luna's one.

8550
07:02:59,060 --> 07:03:01,300
I hope we lose the point because of that.

8551
07:03:05,660 --> 07:03:08,000
Dude, I'm just sitting here.

8552
07:03:09,000 --> 07:03:11,580
I've shot like three people this round.

8553
07:03:11,880 --> 07:03:12,740
Go to front line.

8554
07:03:13,000 --> 07:03:14,220
Front line and don't be a pussy.

8555
07:03:15,100 --> 07:03:16,540
Why are you playing positioning?

8556
07:03:18,880 --> 07:03:21,860
The tanks are doing all the hard work and you're just standing on high ground?

8557
07:03:23,520 --> 07:03:25,140
Yep, I'm standing on high ground.

8558
07:03:25,140 --> 07:03:25,620
What?

8559
07:03:27,920 --> 07:03:29,860
There's a widow on main.

8560
07:03:30,620 --> 07:03:34,060
Do I just not deserve healing because I'm standing on the high ground?

8561
07:03:34,300 --> 07:03:36,020
Yeah, get off the high ground and then you get healed.

8562
07:03:37,200 --> 07:03:37,720
Okay.

8563
07:03:41,520 --> 07:03:43,140
I hope he gets rocked.

8564
07:03:45,220 --> 07:03:46,900
That's really tragic, WayV.

8565
07:03:49,460 --> 07:03:50,500
Why, WayV?

8566
07:03:50,500 --> 07:03:51,060
Why?

8567
07:03:54,680 --> 07:03:57,100
Oh my god.

8568
07:04:00,500 --> 07:04:01,380
Wait.

8569
07:04:03,980 --> 07:04:05,820
Wait, is that my Eternity game?

8570
07:04:09,620 --> 07:04:17,740
Oh my god, I took his Eternity game and gave it to me.

8571
07:04:18,840 --> 07:04:20,000
Is that...

8572
07:04:20,000 --> 07:04:22,000
No, it was not.

8573
07:04:22,140 --> 07:04:24,140
It was not.

8574
07:04:24,260 --> 07:04:24,960
He lied.

8575
07:04:25,540 --> 07:04:27,080
Oh my god.

8576
07:04:27,260 --> 07:04:30,260
I was like, no way.

8577
07:04:34,340 --> 07:04:36,520
I got baited so hard.

8578
07:04:36,640 --> 07:04:39,440
I was like, there's no way this is my Eternity.

8579
07:04:40,020 --> 07:04:43,960
There's no way I played this and it's my Eternity.

8580
07:04:48,900 --> 07:04:49,960
Oh my god.

8581
07:04:50,100 --> 07:04:54,160
After everything we've been through, that's the game we get it from.

8582
07:04:55,600 --> 07:04:56,600
Holy fuck.

8583
07:04:57,020 --> 07:05:04,080
I wouldn't be sad, but like, what a game for it to be my Eternity game.

8584
07:05:06,580 --> 07:05:07,640
Will she get 24 points?

8585
07:05:07,700 --> 07:05:08,480
Do I need 24 points?

8586
07:05:08,540 --> 07:05:09,000
No, I need...

8587
07:05:09,000 --> 07:05:11,280
No, I need 20 points.

8588
07:05:11,420 --> 07:05:12,040
I'm pretty sure.

8589
07:05:13,260 --> 07:05:13,960
Alright, let's see.

8590
07:05:18,560 --> 07:05:19,080
Until...

8591
07:05:19,080 --> 07:05:21,540
We'll figure it out from there.

8592
07:05:21,960 --> 07:05:22,600
I need 16?

8593
07:05:23,100 --> 07:05:24,400
Okay, I just need one win.

8594
07:05:24,640 --> 07:05:25,720
That's all it takes.

8595
07:05:26,240 --> 07:05:27,700
Just one win.

8596
07:05:30,100 --> 07:05:35,260
Oh, my sense is 1.89, but that's my Apex sense.

8597
07:05:35,860 --> 07:05:37,420
And I just converted it from that.

8598
07:05:39,080 --> 07:05:40,260
So that's really it.

8599
07:05:40,620 --> 07:05:42,360
Thank you for the tier 1 sub.

8600
07:05:42,460 --> 07:05:43,900
Thank you, thank you.

8601
07:05:43,900 --> 07:05:44,580
Thank you.

8602
07:05:44,800 --> 07:05:46,020
Just one more.

8603
07:05:46,340 --> 07:05:47,320
Here we go.

8604
07:05:48,800 --> 07:05:50,380
Here we fucking go.

8605
07:05:51,560 --> 07:05:53,540
Oh yeah, I'm fucking looking at my phone.

8606
07:05:56,140 --> 07:05:58,120
I don't know if anybody's learning from me.

8607
07:05:58,200 --> 07:06:00,720
I'm literally like, so chill right now.

8608
07:06:01,420 --> 07:06:01,940
To be fair.

8609
07:06:02,480 --> 07:06:07,020
I think like, in competitive, the more you play, the more you just climb in general.

8610
07:06:09,160 --> 07:06:10,740
Like, if you just keep playing.

8611
07:06:10,740 --> 07:06:17,320
I literally like, I literally just kept playing and playing and playing until like, I got here.

8612
07:06:18,280 --> 07:06:19,500
I got here.

8613
07:06:21,820 --> 07:06:23,700
Wait, you learned how to play Luna from me?

8614
07:06:24,000 --> 07:06:24,540
I don't know.

8615
07:06:25,140 --> 07:06:26,240
I don't know.

8616
07:06:26,520 --> 07:06:28,380
I don't know if what I'm doing is correct.

8617
07:06:28,620 --> 07:06:30,060
I literally just aim.

8618
07:06:30,400 --> 07:06:30,960
To be fair.

8619
07:06:31,560 --> 07:06:37,560
It's literally just like, as long as you hit your freeze on dive characters, you should be fine.

8620
07:06:37,720 --> 07:06:40,340
You should be like, you should be a good Luna.

8621
07:06:40,700 --> 07:06:41,760
As long as you hit your freeze.

8622
07:06:42,380 --> 07:06:43,220
And that's really it.

8623
07:06:43,280 --> 07:06:45,920
You just gotta make sure you hit your freezes on ults.

8624
07:06:46,560 --> 07:06:52,980
And like, have good have good like, game sense.

8625
07:06:53,280 --> 07:07:00,120
And like, I just try to make sure I communicate with my Mantis player and be like, you ult first and stuff.

8626
07:07:01,220 --> 07:07:03,980
I understand the Rocket 1 tricks now.

8627
07:07:04,180 --> 07:07:07,080
The movement is so fun.

8628
07:07:07,500 --> 07:07:10,420
But as long as you're not in GM, you're not throwing anyone's games.

8629
07:07:10,940 --> 07:07:15,860
So, I think like, GM and like, under GM is just a wild wild west.

8630
07:07:15,940 --> 07:07:17,000
Like, you can literally play anything.

8631
07:07:17,720 --> 07:07:21,620
And it'll work because as long as you're good, you can play anything.

8632
07:07:22,040 --> 07:07:26,800
And then when you're in GM and up, I think GM is actually so easy to get into.

8633
07:07:27,200 --> 07:07:28,860
Like, a lot of people are GM now.

8634
07:07:29,120 --> 07:07:32,380
Cause I think GM in general is really easy to get to as a rank.

8635
07:07:32,920 --> 07:07:39,800
It's only It's hard to get past GM 3 where it's hard.

8636
07:07:39,940 --> 07:07:48,560
Cause I was hardstuck GM 3 for like, I think like 3 to 4 days and I was playing every day and I was going fucking insane.

8637
07:07:49,000 --> 07:07:55,360
But I'm still going insane because now I'm like hardstuck GM 1 for the longest fucking time.

8638
07:07:58,920 --> 07:08:01,100
And And...

8639
07:08:02,840 --> 07:08:09,620
Yeah, GM3 is like easy to get to and that's when Elo Hell actually starts, I think.

8640
07:08:11,560 --> 07:08:12,960
Loki's the best support.

8641
07:08:13,640 --> 07:08:25,460
I feel like opinions change a lot because like everyone was like, oh Adam's terrible, but now people know how to play Adam and like people are like, oh, he's not that bad.

8642
07:08:25,460 --> 07:08:26,640
He's actually a really meta pick.

8643
07:08:26,820 --> 07:08:29,360
And at first everyone was like, oh, Rocket is so good.

8644
07:08:29,420 --> 07:08:36,540
Like people would just pick Rocket with Luna or Mantis and now everyone was like, what the fuck are you doing on Rocket?

8645
07:08:37,620 --> 07:08:38,980
Everyone's like, the team up!

8646
07:08:39,360 --> 07:08:40,780
The team up, guys!

8647
07:08:41,000 --> 07:08:42,000
The team up!

8648
07:08:43,200 --> 07:08:49,600
But then like everyone learned that like, oh wait, Adam's better for the soulbond and you play really well.

8649
07:08:50,040 --> 07:08:54,900
Yeah, and everybody hated Wolverine and Hulk, but now everyone bans Hulk and Hulk now.

8650
07:09:00,220 --> 07:09:04,420
So people thought Adam was terrible at first because of his lack of heals and his mercy.

8651
07:09:04,600 --> 07:09:06,860
His mercy res wasn't like super ideal.

8652
07:09:07,700 --> 07:09:10,200
Because it's like super, what's the word?

8653
07:09:10,860 --> 07:09:13,160
Like it's not, people didn't really know how to play.

8654
07:09:13,400 --> 07:09:18,760
People didn't know that like the, you just have to walk to the range of death.

8655
07:09:19,180 --> 07:09:20,400
You can put your res anywhere.

8656
07:09:20,980 --> 07:09:22,620
You can put your Adam res anywhere.

8657
07:09:23,840 --> 07:09:27,920
Adam res is not determined by the distance of whoever dies.

8658
07:09:28,320 --> 07:09:29,780
It's where you are.

8659
07:09:29,900 --> 07:09:35,800
So you put your res down and you literally walk closer to the dead bodies and they'll be taken to the res.

8660
07:09:36,360 --> 07:09:38,320
So like a lot of people didn't know that.

8661
07:09:39,960 --> 07:09:43,300
So there's like a lot of little things that people are just figuring out every day.

8662
07:09:44,240 --> 07:09:46,080
Yeah, the Adam's radius.

8663
07:09:46,820 --> 07:09:52,480
Yes, people like put the res in the front of the fucking, they'll be like, the res has to be close!

8664
07:09:52,620 --> 07:09:54,920
To be fair, the descriptions are freaking terrible.

8665
07:09:55,300 --> 07:09:56,480
The res has to be close to everybody.

8666
07:09:56,640 --> 07:09:59,460
But you can literally put the res in your own spawn if you want.

8667
07:10:00,020 --> 07:10:07,840
Like if you really want to troll your team, you can put your res next to your spawner and just walk over.

8668
07:10:12,840 --> 07:10:18,400
Yeah, it's based on Adam's current position.

8669
07:10:19,020 --> 07:10:20,060
Yeah, people just don't know how to play anymore.

8670
07:10:20,060 --> 07:10:23,160
I learned about his soul bond like yesterday.

8671
07:10:24,020 --> 07:10:26,220
Because I don't play Adam.

8672
07:10:26,960 --> 07:10:32,600
And like I was forced to try learn Adam because like Luna and Mantis kept being banned.

8673
07:10:33,160 --> 07:10:36,040
And then like so though Luna was getting banned a lot.

8674
07:10:36,180 --> 07:10:38,760
So then but then we would I would have another player that would play Mantis.

8675
07:10:38,920 --> 07:10:43,440
So obviously I had to play Adam because Mantis Adam was like really really good.

8676
07:10:43,800 --> 07:10:44,780
And then so like...

8677
07:10:46,120 --> 07:10:50,100
So like Um, I was in like an eternity game too.

8678
07:10:50,160 --> 07:10:52,200
I think I was like the only GM player.

8679
07:10:53,160 --> 07:10:54,520
And uh, or like no.

8680
07:10:54,600 --> 07:10:57,540
It was like me and Mac that were GM players in this eternity lobby.

8681
07:10:57,840 --> 07:11:02,520
And then one of the supports yelled at me because I was they're like stop wasting your soul bond.

8682
07:11:02,880 --> 07:11:04,220
And I was like, I'm sorry.

8683
07:11:04,840 --> 07:11:07,360
I don't I don't play Adam.

8684
07:11:08,520 --> 07:11:11,680
They're like, oh my god, you gotta use your soul bond when...

8685
07:11:12,240 --> 07:11:17,160
Um when we're all super low or like we're getting ulted and everything.

8686
07:11:17,200 --> 07:11:22,100
And I was just like, but then I learned and now I'm a better Adam player because of it.

8687
07:11:22,240 --> 07:11:26,100
It's tough fucking love, but I'm a better Adam player now.

8688
07:11:29,480 --> 07:11:31,560
I was like, I'm sorry.

8689
07:11:32,380 --> 07:11:35,760
I usually don't have to play Adam.

8690
07:11:36,960 --> 07:11:40,780
But now I forced myself to learn Adam, so I'm okay now.

8691
07:11:42,580 --> 07:11:46,920
How do you keep a positive attitude when you're on a... oh guys, I don't know.

8692
07:11:47,100 --> 07:11:49,280
I was freaking out like five hours ago.

8693
07:11:49,380 --> 07:11:50,280
I don't fucking know.

8694
07:11:52,540 --> 07:11:57,540
I was fucking freaking out like five hours ago.

8695
07:12:00,400 --> 07:12:02,560
I believe they're going to have a Namor.

8696
07:12:03,800 --> 07:12:08,240
It's less of a positive attitude and more of like I'm fucking going insane.

8697
07:12:08,240 --> 07:12:14,020
Dude, if I laugh the pain away, maybe I'll feel... maybe I'll feel something.

8698
07:12:21,300 --> 07:12:23,920
Why are we just bad mantis?

8699
07:12:29,430 --> 07:12:30,730
Okay, they got Hella.

8700
07:12:32,250 --> 07:12:33,070
What do we get?

8701
07:12:33,990 --> 07:12:34,470
Namor?

8702
07:12:35,210 --> 07:12:35,990
Oh nice.

8703
07:12:36,210 --> 07:12:37,630
That's fucking crazy.

8704
07:12:38,550 --> 07:12:40,050
Triple DPS is fine.

8705
07:12:41,550 --> 07:12:43,270
Or triple support is fine, sorry.

8706
07:12:44,230 --> 07:12:44,910
That's fine.

8707
07:12:46,230 --> 07:12:47,470
We can do this.

8708
07:12:48,230 --> 07:12:49,430
Who's carrying me?

8709
07:12:50,290 --> 07:12:50,830
Mace.

8710
07:12:51,410 --> 07:12:52,390
And Ruben's here too.

8711
07:12:52,830 --> 07:12:53,750
I'm joking.

8712
07:12:54,150 --> 07:12:55,550
I'm doing Ruben and Mace.

8713
07:13:00,290 --> 07:13:06,270
We have to admit, we have like a 90% win rate with Mace right now.

8714
07:13:10,810 --> 07:13:11,930
So ungrateful.

8715
07:13:11,990 --> 07:13:13,570
I said I was joking.

8716
07:13:14,690 --> 07:13:16,350
I put slash JK.

8717
07:13:20,430 --> 07:13:22,510
I put slash JK.

8718
07:13:23,350 --> 07:13:24,750
This should be fine.

8719
07:13:28,530 --> 07:13:29,550
Slash JK.

8720
07:13:30,250 --> 07:13:31,930
I freaked out on Ruben a lot today.

8721
07:13:32,070 --> 07:13:33,590
I was like, Ruben, I swear to fucking God.

8722
07:13:41,670 --> 07:13:45,270
I'm glad that things turned around.

8723
07:13:45,570 --> 07:13:47,410
Wait, Doki, is this your eternity game?

8724
07:13:48,190 --> 07:13:49,090
Don't, don't, no.

8725
07:13:49,570 --> 07:13:49,590
Shh.

8726
07:13:57,410 --> 07:13:59,390
Don't say it's my eternity game!

8727
07:13:59,850 --> 07:14:06,910
Because people would be like, oh it's time, you're gonna, it's time to pay people off now.

8728
07:14:07,650 --> 07:14:09,490
They're gonna pay people off.

8729
07:14:09,670 --> 07:14:10,690
I don't trust.

8730
07:14:11,530 --> 07:14:12,910
I don't trust.

8731
07:14:13,870 --> 07:14:16,050
I don't trust people anymore.

8732
07:14:16,430 --> 07:14:18,190
People are fucked up.

8733
07:14:18,590 --> 07:14:19,730
Wait, I need, I need help.

8734
07:14:19,990 --> 07:14:21,730
I'm gonna try to flank the Punisher here.

8735
07:14:23,050 --> 07:14:24,310
I'll go for the Punisher.

8736
07:14:29,140 --> 07:14:30,300
Don't worry!

8737
07:14:31,080 --> 07:14:32,960
You'll never die!

8738
07:14:34,520 --> 07:14:35,940
Wait, you're walled, you're walled.

8739
07:14:37,640 --> 07:14:39,160
There's like, yeah, there's a hell of a skill.

8740
07:14:39,280 --> 07:14:39,860
Or Scarlet.

8741
07:14:40,140 --> 07:14:42,020
There's a Groot and a Scarlet up there.

8742
07:14:43,280 --> 07:14:44,340
I'll go, actually, I'll go after them.

8743
07:14:44,980 --> 07:14:46,000
Yeah, I'm gonna go after them.

8744
07:14:47,820 --> 07:14:48,860
Oh my God.

8745
07:14:52,460 --> 07:14:53,340
This is scary.

8746
07:14:54,640 --> 07:14:55,700
This is very scary.

8747
07:14:59,340 --> 07:15:00,460
This is very scary.

8748
07:15:05,900 --> 07:15:08,140
That's fine, we have their high ground now!

8749
07:15:08,280 --> 07:15:09,380
What are they gonna do about it?

8750
07:15:10,500 --> 07:15:11,740
Kill our only tank?

8751
07:15:12,540 --> 07:15:13,500
That would be great.

8752
07:15:18,280 --> 07:15:19,620
Oh my God.

8753
07:15:19,940 --> 07:15:21,620
Why did I wake him right after?

8754
07:15:22,000 --> 07:15:22,140
Why?

8755
07:15:23,700 --> 07:15:26,560
Nobody knew I woke him right after.

8756
07:15:26,940 --> 07:15:31,140
Except the Loki knows we need him to die so we can...

8757
07:15:32,840 --> 07:15:34,720
Nobody knows except for...

8758
07:15:34,720 --> 07:15:35,580
Oh, I almost had my ult.

8759
07:15:40,500 --> 07:15:41,900
Give it up for ours.

8760
07:15:42,820 --> 07:15:44,440
We should be fine behind this.

8761
07:15:45,860 --> 07:15:47,380
Oh, he's not fine.

8762
07:15:47,700 --> 07:15:48,680
Oh, that's good!

8763
07:15:48,860 --> 07:15:50,180
I told you, no witnesses.

8764
07:15:51,600 --> 07:15:52,240
No.

8765
07:15:53,140 --> 07:15:55,500
You're not dying on me, Mace.

8766
07:15:55,600 --> 07:15:58,160
We might lose this game because I did that.

8767
07:15:58,920 --> 07:15:59,840
Yes, yes.

8768
07:16:00,500 --> 07:16:00,800
Okay.

8769
07:16:02,580 --> 07:16:03,560
It's fine.

8770
07:16:08,730 --> 07:16:09,750
Oh my God.

8771
07:16:09,910 --> 07:16:10,850
Nobody's dying.

8772
07:16:12,470 --> 07:16:13,390
It's fine.

8773
07:16:17,030 --> 07:16:17,330
Nice.

8774
07:16:18,310 --> 07:16:19,670
There's a Scarlet Turret.

8775
07:16:21,530 --> 07:16:22,410
Look at that.

8776
07:16:22,830 --> 07:16:23,770
It's not a throw.

8777
07:16:27,090 --> 07:16:29,030
But he doesn't know.

8778
07:16:29,590 --> 07:16:30,550
It's okay.

8779
07:16:30,710 --> 07:16:31,730
The witness is dead.

8780
07:16:31,990 --> 07:16:33,430
He'll never know what I did.

8781
07:16:34,110 --> 07:16:35,910
It was such a good freeze.

8782
07:16:36,110 --> 07:16:39,050
I was like, what if he's not frozen though?

8783
07:16:39,050 --> 07:16:44,030
Like, what if I just wake him up right after?

8784
07:16:45,150 --> 07:16:47,510
Wouldn't that be fucking crazy if I just did that?

8785
07:16:49,670 --> 07:16:51,830
It's a crazy-ass freeze.

8786
07:16:52,070 --> 07:16:52,570
I need heals.

8787
07:16:52,770 --> 07:16:53,130
Thank you.

8788
07:16:59,930 --> 07:17:01,650
Oh, he's so sick.

8789
07:17:03,510 --> 07:17:05,290
Fuck you, Discord kitten.

8790
07:17:11,420 --> 07:17:13,300
Wait, there's a Scarlet Turret.

8791
07:17:13,300 --> 07:17:13,900
Top.

8792
07:17:17,410 --> 07:17:18,790
Alright, everything's fine.

8793
07:17:19,910 --> 07:17:20,930
Point blank.

8794
07:17:21,050 --> 07:17:22,690
I was just like, there she is!

8795
07:17:28,020 --> 07:17:29,880
I'll ult, but don't peek it.

8796
07:17:35,600 --> 07:17:38,100
Oh my God, he's fucking crazy.

8797
07:17:40,540 --> 07:17:41,220
Goodbye.

8798
07:17:41,600 --> 07:17:41,900
Goodbye.

8799
07:17:42,940 --> 07:17:44,300
Oh, bye.

8800
07:17:44,680 --> 07:17:45,560
I lived.

8801
07:17:45,560 --> 07:17:45,880
I died.

8802
07:17:51,150 --> 07:17:52,610
I actually lived.

8803
07:17:52,790 --> 07:17:54,070
Oh, there's a group behind.

8804
07:17:54,990 --> 07:17:55,510
Goodbye.

8805
07:17:59,860 --> 07:18:00,380
No!

8806
07:18:05,580 --> 07:18:10,280
It's okay, they used so many things, but we also used so many things too.

8807
07:18:11,500 --> 07:18:13,360
They should have Scarlet ult.

8808
07:18:17,360 --> 07:18:19,320
That should be the only ult they have, right?

8809
07:18:19,320 --> 07:18:20,740
There we go.

8810
07:18:22,120 --> 07:18:22,660
What?!

8811
07:18:22,660 --> 07:18:25,220
There it is.

8812
07:18:26,300 --> 07:18:27,880
Oh my God!

8813
07:18:28,000 --> 07:18:29,720
You're walled off, but you're fine.

8814
07:18:33,490 --> 07:18:35,580
Jesus, there's a Groot behind us?

8815
07:18:39,230 --> 07:18:40,870
Bro, he's so locked in.

8816
07:18:40,950 --> 07:18:42,870
Mace isn't even fucking talking anymore.

8817
07:18:43,370 --> 07:18:44,950
He's so fucking locked in.

8818
07:18:44,990 --> 07:18:46,150
He's like, get me out of here.

8819
07:18:52,070 --> 07:18:53,430
Get me out of here.

8820
07:18:54,250 --> 07:18:54,970
There's a Groot.

8821
07:18:55,110 --> 07:18:55,810
I froze him.

8822
07:18:57,490 --> 07:18:57,890
Alright.

8823
07:19:01,350 --> 07:19:02,770
He's so locked in.

8824
07:19:06,150 --> 07:19:07,450
Jesus Christ, you're walled off.

8825
07:19:11,200 --> 07:19:13,320
How do you...

8826
07:19:13,320 --> 07:19:13,960
Oh, perfect.

8827
07:19:19,010 --> 07:19:20,750
We're like, even right now.

8828
07:19:21,990 --> 07:19:23,390
We should have Adam ult though.

8829
07:19:23,390 --> 07:19:25,290
There's a Groot above us.

8830
07:19:29,070 --> 07:19:30,650
They have Groot ult.

8831
07:19:32,330 --> 07:19:34,510
I'm just gonna kite that out of the way.

8832
07:19:39,380 --> 07:19:40,300
Oh shit.

8833
07:19:41,640 --> 07:19:42,380
We're even?

8834
07:19:52,160 --> 07:19:53,520
I'm not looking!

8835
07:19:56,960 --> 07:19:58,120
We'll get Mantis ult first.

8836
07:19:58,220 --> 07:19:58,660
I'll do second.

8837
07:20:09,320 --> 07:20:11,560
Okay, Mantis is dead, but we're okay.

8838
07:20:18,880 --> 07:20:19,860
Look, there's Magneto.

8839
07:20:24,610 --> 07:20:25,480
Oh my god.

8840
07:20:26,300 --> 07:20:27,040
Magneto, Groot.

8841
07:20:28,860 --> 07:20:29,340
Oh, perfect.

8842
07:20:30,400 --> 07:20:31,360
I'll ult after this.

8843
07:20:32,000 --> 07:20:33,480
I'm getting away from the point now.

8844
07:20:35,240 --> 07:20:36,500
I froze somebody.

8845
07:20:39,860 --> 07:20:40,920
Oh, that's behind.

8846
07:20:47,550 --> 07:20:48,150
Groot's half.

8847
07:20:48,290 --> 07:20:48,630
Groot's low.

8848
07:20:48,690 --> 07:20:49,050
Groot's one.

8849
07:20:51,170 --> 07:20:52,270
Punisher, low.

8850
07:20:55,870 --> 07:20:57,030
Jesus Christ.

8851
07:20:57,850 --> 07:20:58,730
Where's the bridge?

8852
07:20:58,830 --> 07:20:59,110
Okay.

8853
07:21:03,430 --> 07:21:04,450
I'm on point.

8854
07:21:04,990 --> 07:21:05,890
I'm pushing cart.

8855
07:21:07,070 --> 07:21:08,710
Give me a sec, I need to fix my frames.

8856
07:21:08,830 --> 07:21:09,470
Give me like seven seconds.

8857
07:21:11,030 --> 07:21:12,450
I don't know.

8858
07:21:12,810 --> 07:21:14,490
That does not sound great.

8859
07:21:19,070 --> 07:21:19,690
That's it.

8860
07:21:34,370 --> 07:21:35,330
I'm pushing cart.

8861
07:21:35,390 --> 07:21:36,610
There's a Groot above us.

8862
07:21:36,790 --> 07:21:37,250
On the bridge.

8863
07:21:41,480 --> 07:21:43,540
Yeah, fuck that Groot in particular.

8864
07:21:44,260 --> 07:21:45,720
I don't have anything for it.

8865
07:21:46,180 --> 07:21:47,980
There's a Groot behind us.

8866
07:21:48,960 --> 07:21:49,500
Groot's one!

8867
07:21:49,580 --> 07:21:49,900
Groot's one!

8868
07:21:49,960 --> 07:21:50,340
Groot's one!

8869
07:21:59,260 --> 07:22:01,720
This is last, but...

8870
07:22:04,220 --> 07:22:05,480
Oh, skip five.

8871
07:22:20,480 --> 07:22:22,040
I don't see you, Mace.

8872
07:22:22,180 --> 07:22:22,700
I see you.

8873
07:22:22,700 --> 07:22:24,600
I have orb on you.

8874
07:22:25,940 --> 07:22:27,360
I have 96.

8875
07:22:34,300 --> 07:22:35,820
We're so healthy.

8876
07:22:38,140 --> 07:22:39,940
I have no idea.

8877
07:22:43,390 --> 07:22:44,220
Above us!

8878
07:22:48,800 --> 07:22:49,660
Okay,

8879
07:22:58,180 --> 07:22:59,020
perfect.

8880
07:23:08,180 --> 07:23:08,860
Wait, Gristal!

8881
07:23:08,920 --> 07:23:09,200
Grist one!

8882
07:23:09,300 --> 07:23:09,940
Grist one!

8883
07:23:10,760 --> 07:23:11,120
Nice.

8884
07:23:13,380 --> 07:23:14,560
We can kill Luna, maybe?

8885
07:23:18,940 --> 07:23:20,000
I'm getting off the cart.

8886
07:23:21,060 --> 07:23:22,120
So I can heal you back.

8887
07:23:27,260 --> 07:23:30,520
Wait, who's on cart, Diddy?

8888
07:23:30,520 --> 07:23:31,940
Bless the heroes.

8889
07:23:40,980 --> 07:23:44,400
Oh my god, I can't see anything!

8890
07:23:53,200 --> 07:23:55,360
Oh my god.

8891
07:23:58,100 --> 07:24:00,400
Oh my god.

8892
07:24:00,600 --> 07:24:01,480
That's a good push, that's fine.

8893
07:24:03,920 --> 07:24:04,880
That was...

8894
07:24:04,880 --> 07:24:07,120
That was a pretty good ult from them.

8895
07:24:12,660 --> 07:24:14,780
That was a really good ult by them.

8896
07:24:17,620 --> 07:24:18,920
We pushed pretty far.

8897
07:24:21,900 --> 07:24:25,560
Of course the Eternity game has to be one of the sweatiest games I've played today.

8898
07:24:27,120 --> 07:24:28,120
Oh my god.

8899
07:24:28,920 --> 07:24:30,740
This has to be the most sweaty one.

8900
07:24:31,540 --> 07:24:32,620
Of them all.

8901
07:24:36,610 --> 07:24:37,610
Oh my god.

8902
07:24:38,490 --> 07:24:39,190
You know what's...

8903
07:24:39,190 --> 07:24:40,330
Oh my god, I'm not even tired.

8904
07:24:40,510 --> 07:24:41,230
That's the worst part.

8905
07:24:43,630 --> 07:24:44,670
That's actually...

8906
07:24:44,670 --> 07:24:46,030
The fucking worst part.

8907
07:24:46,210 --> 07:24:47,370
I'm not even tired.

8908
07:24:47,570 --> 07:24:49,610
I have like Rinka drilling right now.

8909
07:24:50,230 --> 07:24:50,710
Alright.

8910
07:24:52,050 --> 07:24:53,610
We're as wavy when you need them.

8911
07:24:53,770 --> 07:24:55,130
To be on the enemy team.

8912
07:24:57,130 --> 07:25:00,570
No, I haven't been tired this entire stream.

8913
07:25:00,570 --> 07:25:01,790
Not gonna lie.

8914
07:25:03,910 --> 07:25:05,590
I just haven't been tired this entire stream.

8915
07:25:07,810 --> 07:25:08,730
Lois death...

8916
07:25:08,730 --> 07:25:10,130
Deserves the eloderin.

8917
07:25:14,610 --> 07:25:15,530
That's insane.

8918
07:25:15,890 --> 07:25:17,110
That's always been me with rank.

8919
07:25:17,210 --> 07:25:18,730
That's why I can play super long hours.

8920
07:25:18,870 --> 07:25:21,690
I just get adrenaline from playing competitive for some reason.

8921
07:25:22,110 --> 07:25:23,670
I just love grinding rank.

8922
07:25:24,530 --> 07:25:27,370
I have to add rank in there just in case people put me out of context.

8923
07:25:27,370 --> 07:25:31,570
I just really like playing rank.

8924
07:25:31,730 --> 07:25:32,750
No, it doesn't hit.

8925
07:25:32,830 --> 07:25:35,350
It only hits when I stop playing.

8926
07:25:36,330 --> 07:25:37,950
But I can literally play for hours.

8927
07:25:38,490 --> 07:25:40,590
Actual long, long hours.

8928
07:25:41,790 --> 07:25:42,870
It's literally like...

8929
07:25:42,870 --> 07:25:44,650
I need heals real quick.

8930
07:25:45,730 --> 07:25:45,990
On Luna.

8931
07:25:47,410 --> 07:25:48,810
Oh my god, Yawana, Yawana!

8932
07:25:49,470 --> 07:25:50,270
That's chill.

8933
07:25:57,120 --> 07:25:59,600
Oh, Grizzlo!

8934
07:26:04,440 --> 07:26:05,920
I froze, I froze!

8935
07:26:06,060 --> 07:26:06,520
Oh no!

8936
07:26:11,120 --> 07:26:12,700
I'm trying to keep you up.

8937
07:26:15,180 --> 07:26:16,020
Patch you up.

8938
07:26:18,340 --> 07:26:19,340
Hit the wall, please.

8939
07:26:27,390 --> 07:26:28,070
Reload.

8940
07:26:28,850 --> 07:26:30,190
There's a wall, there's a wall, there's a wall.

8941
07:26:30,790 --> 07:26:31,750
There's two walls, too.

8942
07:26:40,840 --> 07:26:42,620
I have grit on me.

8943
07:26:46,940 --> 07:26:47,620
No!

8944
07:26:49,920 --> 07:26:51,280
Holy fuck!

8945
07:26:53,960 --> 07:26:56,260
What the fuck was that?

8946
07:26:56,500 --> 07:26:58,200
For so long!

8947
07:26:58,420 --> 07:27:00,740
He got off from it!

8948
07:27:01,720 --> 07:27:03,040
Alright, we just reset here.

8949
07:27:10,680 --> 07:27:12,520
He lived for so long!

8950
07:27:12,940 --> 07:27:14,240
Why is that hole there?

8951
07:27:20,480 --> 07:27:22,240
That shouldn't hit me, right?

8952
07:27:23,940 --> 07:27:25,220
Yep, thank god.

8953
07:27:28,880 --> 07:27:29,940
Brute's kind of high.

8954
07:27:38,880 --> 07:27:39,880
That's safe.

8955
07:27:39,980 --> 07:27:40,940
Brute's flanking with ult.

8956
07:27:41,100 --> 07:27:43,400
I torched it out.

8957
07:27:44,560 --> 07:27:45,420
K.O.!

8958
07:27:48,580 --> 07:27:50,740
Oh, we gotta push up soon, though.

8959
07:28:00,560 --> 07:28:01,440
Where is he?

8960
07:28:03,780 --> 07:28:04,480
I'm ulting.

8961
07:28:06,660 --> 07:28:07,180
Alright.

8962
07:28:07,580 --> 07:28:09,060
I'm dancing up top now.

8963
07:28:10,120 --> 07:28:11,540
Oh, you're walled off, you're walled off.

8964
07:28:14,100 --> 07:28:16,360
I'm okay, I got the rap!

8965
07:28:16,620 --> 07:28:17,120
My ult's over.

8966
07:28:18,960 --> 07:28:19,880
Nice, good job.

8967
07:28:26,590 --> 07:28:28,070
We should have Magneto.

8968
07:28:40,450 --> 07:28:45,770
I hope my other support players are healing the DPS.

8969
07:28:46,310 --> 07:28:47,990
I'm trying to make sure.

8970
07:28:51,250 --> 07:28:53,290
I froze Magneto.

8971
07:28:58,480 --> 07:28:59,940
You're walled off, you're walled off.

8972
07:28:59,940 --> 07:29:02,740
Bring on the chaos!

8973
07:29:04,400 --> 07:29:05,840
There's a Scarlet on your left.

8974
07:29:16,940 --> 07:29:19,200
So you should have Scarlet ult here.

8975
07:29:19,760 --> 07:29:20,320
Yeah.

8976
07:29:23,980 --> 07:29:27,540
I'm not close to ult yet for Brute.

8977
07:29:34,030 --> 07:29:35,790
Can we break the wall top right?

8978
07:29:41,940 --> 07:29:43,140
Can you top me off?

8979
07:29:43,140 --> 07:29:44,820
I need top off.

8980
07:29:49,160 --> 07:29:51,520
I have ult for Brute.

8981
07:29:56,040 --> 07:29:57,560
Top left, top left!

8982
07:30:02,390 --> 07:30:03,810
I have to use it.

8983
07:30:07,470 --> 07:30:08,610
We're down one.

8984
07:30:09,970 --> 07:30:11,170
There's a Luna right behind us.

8985
07:30:13,910 --> 07:30:15,610
We're down a lot, nevermind.

8986
07:30:20,350 --> 07:30:22,090
I can TP back.

8987
07:30:22,450 --> 07:30:25,370
We can Mantis ult.

8988
07:30:28,710 --> 07:30:30,870
Our Mantis is getting shot at.

8989
07:30:33,510 --> 07:30:35,030
Our Mantis is going in now.

8990
07:30:52,530 --> 07:30:53,530
Where's Mace?

8991
07:30:53,990 --> 07:30:54,870
Where is he?

8992
07:30:54,970 --> 07:30:55,610
Oh, there he is.

8993
07:30:55,930 --> 07:30:57,410
Nevermind, I'm not scared anymore.

8994
07:31:02,930 --> 07:31:04,830
Let's make sure we don't get C9 here.

8995
07:31:09,330 --> 07:31:11,070
Break the wall, break the wall, break the wall.

8996
07:31:17,940 --> 07:31:18,860
I need top off.

8997
07:31:19,340 --> 07:31:20,300
I need top off, we're fine.

8998
07:31:24,080 --> 07:31:25,280
They used Luna ult.

8999
07:31:25,340 --> 07:31:26,280
That's really big.

9000
07:31:48,960 --> 07:31:49,600
We're good.

9001
07:31:49,600 --> 07:31:51,420
I guess not, I guess I leave.

9002
07:31:58,200 --> 07:32:00,400
I have ult for Brute.

9003
07:32:03,180 --> 07:32:04,520
And they used Bucky ult too.

9004
07:32:04,780 --> 07:32:06,240
They have tank ults.

9005
07:32:14,210 --> 07:32:15,450
Oh, Mantis, please.

9006
07:32:20,620 --> 07:32:23,200
Oh my god, we have double tank?

9007
07:32:25,080 --> 07:32:27,820
He's going off of Loki?

9008
07:32:29,060 --> 07:32:31,880
Oh my god, what is this?

9009
07:32:33,420 --> 07:32:34,840
Oh, I might die to this.

9010
07:32:42,230 --> 07:32:42,730
I froze him.

9011
07:32:43,730 --> 07:32:44,970
He's so low, he's one.

9012
07:32:48,330 --> 07:32:49,910
I'm pushing up with damage.

9013
07:32:53,070 --> 07:32:55,030
They have one more fight here.

9014
07:32:55,290 --> 07:32:56,370
But we don't have support ults.

9015
07:32:57,190 --> 07:32:58,150
What did they use that fight?

9016
07:32:59,170 --> 07:32:59,610
Brute.

9017
07:33:02,370 --> 07:33:02,810
Magneto.

9018
07:33:03,770 --> 07:33:05,830
But they haven't used their support ults here.

9019
07:33:10,660 --> 07:33:12,180
We need to just win, we don't have support.

9020
07:33:14,520 --> 07:33:15,500
How about a back up?

9021
07:33:21,460 --> 07:33:22,240
Back, back, back.

9022
07:33:22,740 --> 07:33:23,540
Back, back, back.

9023
07:33:27,300 --> 07:33:28,840
I don't know if our Magneto...

9024
07:33:28,840 --> 07:33:29,960
Magneto, you're walled up, you're walled up.

9025
07:33:31,600 --> 07:33:32,540
I might die though.

9026
07:33:33,640 --> 07:33:34,920
Nah, we have time, we have time.

9027
07:33:35,520 --> 07:33:36,580
They only have one on Taric.

9028
07:33:38,200 --> 07:33:39,420
Worst case scenario, I touch.

9029
07:33:41,940 --> 07:33:43,640
You touch for a second and then get off?

9030
07:33:44,380 --> 07:33:44,680
Yes.

9031
07:33:47,340 --> 07:33:49,000
I can't get to you all.

9032
07:33:53,100 --> 07:33:53,860
No!

9033
07:33:55,800 --> 07:33:57,400
We were so close.

9034
07:33:58,800 --> 07:34:00,420
Oh my god.

9035
07:34:03,000 --> 07:34:05,520
Oh, that was such a close game.

9036
07:34:07,860 --> 07:34:10,520
That was actually such a...

9037
07:34:10,520 --> 07:34:12,160
Oh my god.

9038
07:34:14,420 --> 07:34:16,040
We had two ults too.

9039
07:34:16,040 --> 07:34:17,700
That's actually... oh my god.

9040
07:34:18,560 --> 07:34:20,180
Oh, I guess we go again.

9041
07:34:20,260 --> 07:34:21,580
I guess we go again.

9042
07:34:21,720 --> 07:34:22,960
Minus 22, that's not bad.

9043
07:34:25,540 --> 07:34:28,040
Oh my god, I guess we go again.

9044
07:34:28,520 --> 07:34:30,540
Oh, that was such a...

9045
07:34:30,540 --> 07:34:31,980
That was a good game too.

9046
07:34:32,400 --> 07:34:34,440
I actually locked in.

9047
07:34:36,220 --> 07:34:39,860
I was so locked in too.

9048
07:34:42,540 --> 07:34:45,080
40k for solo tank is really good.

9049
07:34:45,080 --> 07:34:46,540
For triple support?

9050
07:34:47,320 --> 07:34:51,000
Triple support solo tank and I was able to grab 40k off of that?

9051
07:34:51,120 --> 07:34:52,220
It was actually insane.

9052
07:34:52,680 --> 07:34:55,480
Because then we also have 20k healing from the other two support.

9053
07:34:57,240 --> 07:34:59,300
Ruben got paid off.

9054
07:35:01,440 --> 07:35:03,540
Oh my god, imagine that.

9055
07:35:07,480 --> 07:35:09,780
They whispered to Ruben and was like...

9056
07:35:09,780 --> 07:35:12,220
Come on, you know you want her to keep going.

9057
07:35:12,880 --> 07:35:13,640
You know it.

9058
07:35:17,640 --> 07:35:19,220
Chai, thank you for the 5k subs.

9059
07:35:19,420 --> 07:35:19,620
Thank you.

9060
07:35:21,120 --> 07:35:22,000
Twitch Prime.

9061
07:35:22,160 --> 07:35:24,200
Thank you.

9062
07:35:24,560 --> 07:35:27,300
How do you pause the ad view when you're on bad loss streak?

9063
07:35:27,360 --> 07:35:28,100
Do you just keep grinding?

9064
07:35:29,120 --> 07:35:30,000
It's because I'm streaming.

9065
07:35:30,200 --> 07:35:32,980
If I'm toxic on stream, it's going to be over for me.

9066
07:35:33,220 --> 07:35:37,120
I think we ban Hulk first.

9067
07:35:41,480 --> 07:35:43,200
Oh man, the off stream.

9068
07:35:43,840 --> 07:35:45,720
Off stream when no one is streaming?

9069
07:35:45,720 --> 07:35:46,700
Oh...

9070
07:35:47,800 --> 07:35:48,980
Shit gets crazy.

9071
07:35:49,580 --> 07:35:51,460
I don't want to get cancelled.

9072
07:35:56,160 --> 07:35:57,520
Oh, they forgot to ban.

9073
07:36:04,280 --> 07:36:05,160
Oh man, no.

9074
07:36:05,420 --> 07:36:06,340
Off stream...

9075
07:36:06,340 --> 07:36:07,500
Off stream...

9076
07:36:09,300 --> 07:36:10,800
Off stream when no one is streaming?

9077
07:36:11,720 --> 07:36:12,880
Things get crazy.

9078
07:36:18,250 --> 07:36:19,170
Off stream me?

9079
07:36:19,250 --> 07:36:20,310
I'm not okay.

9080
07:36:20,310 --> 07:36:25,250
If you think current stream me is okay, it's not okay.

9081
07:36:25,410 --> 07:36:26,990
Off stream me is not okay.

9082
07:36:29,270 --> 07:36:31,470
He's a really good Iron Fist if he doesn't get shut down.

9083
07:36:36,160 --> 07:36:37,160
We're close.

9084
07:36:37,380 --> 07:36:39,860
We were literally one game off and then we got...

9085
07:36:40,520 --> 07:36:42,240
We had three support players.

9086
07:36:47,090 --> 07:36:49,850
Usually it works, but this time it didn't work.

9087
07:36:51,770 --> 07:36:52,790
This time.

9088
07:36:52,790 --> 07:36:56,070
The enemy team can finally say I beat a rank 1 player.

9089
07:36:56,410 --> 07:36:57,990
I should put that in their title.

9090
07:36:58,590 --> 07:37:01,390
I beat a rank 1 player and...

9091
07:37:01,390 --> 07:37:02,330
Oh my god, wait.

9092
07:37:02,370 --> 07:37:04,410
I can make a clickbait title right now.

9093
07:37:09,650 --> 07:37:10,730
Playing with...

9094
07:37:11,950 --> 07:37:14,410
Playing with the rank 1 player?

9095
07:37:25,050 --> 07:37:25,570
The rank 1 player?

9096
07:37:25,570 --> 07:37:26,190
Oh my god, look.

9097
07:37:29,710 --> 07:37:32,370
Oh my gosh, thank god I can clickbait.

9098
07:37:35,950 --> 07:37:37,070
The rank 1 player?

9099
07:37:37,490 --> 07:37:38,950
That's a YouTube upload right there.

9100
07:37:39,090 --> 07:37:40,710
I say as I don't do videos.

9101
07:37:40,710 --> 07:37:43,310
Wait, what the fuck?

9102
07:37:43,990 --> 07:37:47,530
What happened?

9103
07:37:49,630 --> 07:37:51,770
Oh my god, did we win?

9104
07:37:52,190 --> 07:37:53,990
Did we win the brawl?

9105
07:37:55,510 --> 07:37:58,090
I'll try to get another pick here.

9106
07:37:58,310 --> 07:37:59,530
Oh my god.

9107
07:38:00,010 --> 07:38:02,790
What the fuck was that brawl?

9108
07:38:03,330 --> 07:38:04,050
Huge.

9109
07:38:05,230 --> 07:38:08,590
That scared the shit out...

9110
07:38:08,590 --> 07:38:10,110
Oh my god.

9111
07:38:11,430 --> 07:38:13,350
Did you know they were gonna do that?

9112
07:38:21,210 --> 07:38:22,250
That's crazy.

9113
07:38:23,310 --> 07:38:24,370
Look, it's like, yes.

9114
07:38:29,200 --> 07:38:30,060
Oh, I might be dead here.

9115
07:38:33,910 --> 07:38:34,950
Oh my god.

9116
07:38:37,550 --> 07:38:38,330
He knew.

9117
07:38:38,550 --> 07:38:40,090
Only a rank 1 player would know.

9118
07:38:47,110 --> 07:38:48,330
Oh my god, he's whipping him.

9119
07:38:50,170 --> 07:38:52,010
He is Doctor Strange, of course.

9120
07:38:52,170 --> 07:38:55,390
That scared the shit out of me.

9121
07:38:55,510 --> 07:38:57,170
I was like, excuse me?

9122
07:38:57,730 --> 07:39:01,830
The fuck was that?

9123
07:39:08,520 --> 07:39:09,260
Oh my god.

9124
07:39:11,960 --> 07:39:13,100
I froze somebody.

9125
07:39:16,320 --> 07:39:17,400
Oh my god, he's climbing.

9126
07:39:19,960 --> 07:39:22,220
Oh my god, he's following him.

9127
07:39:29,460 --> 07:39:30,620
There's a magic here, right?

9128
07:39:36,840 --> 07:39:37,840
I got...

9129
07:39:37,840 --> 07:39:39,440
Oh, that was sick.

9130
07:39:40,640 --> 07:39:42,520
That was a sick ult right there.

9131
07:39:49,340 --> 07:39:50,600
You're so healthy.

9132
07:39:50,820 --> 07:39:51,620
You're so healthy.

9133
07:39:54,060 --> 07:39:54,660
No!

9134
07:39:57,340 --> 07:39:58,540
I cannot...

9135
07:40:07,720 --> 07:40:10,440
Where can I go?

9136
07:40:20,290 --> 07:40:20,810
Oh no.

9137
07:40:21,490 --> 07:40:23,050
Oh, Magnus won.

9138
07:40:23,130 --> 07:40:23,590
Magnus won.

9139
07:40:25,950 --> 07:40:26,650
Nice.

9140
07:40:29,310 --> 07:40:31,870
You look wicked while fucking ulting, bro.

9141
07:40:35,210 --> 07:40:37,190
Get dunked on.

9142
07:40:37,930 --> 07:40:40,210
Oh my god.

9143
07:40:40,210 --> 07:40:42,590
I cannot run it.

9144
07:40:42,830 --> 07:40:45,310
He hates K-pop.

9145
07:40:50,390 --> 07:40:52,690
My man fucking hates K-pop.

9146
07:40:53,070 --> 07:40:53,890
I mean, he's old.

9147
07:40:54,450 --> 07:40:55,650
He's like a grandpa.

9148
07:40:55,810 --> 07:40:57,810
I don't think he understands K-pop, guys.

9149
07:41:00,310 --> 07:41:01,770
He's seeping through a lot.

9150
07:41:04,890 --> 07:41:06,270
Yeah, he's old.

9151
07:41:06,370 --> 07:41:07,470
He hates new music.

9152
07:41:10,210 --> 07:41:10,410
I don't know.

9153
07:41:14,250 --> 07:41:15,690
I've never seen a Luna.

9154
07:41:15,890 --> 07:41:17,550
I don't know what it is.

9155
07:41:17,590 --> 07:41:18,450
I just...

9156
07:41:19,610 --> 07:41:21,050
What do I do?

9157
07:41:21,170 --> 07:41:22,010
I run.

9158
07:41:22,490 --> 07:41:23,890
And it still hits me.

9159
07:41:24,010 --> 07:41:25,850
I don't know what...

9160
07:41:25,850 --> 07:41:27,730
At least it just hits me, I guess.

9161
07:41:29,450 --> 07:41:31,250
Like, where do I go?

9162
07:41:37,610 --> 07:41:38,410
Where do I go?

9163
07:41:38,410 --> 07:41:39,730
Where the fuck do I go?

9164
07:41:39,890 --> 07:41:40,750
I don't know.

9165
07:41:41,230 --> 07:41:42,550
Someone please explain.

9166
07:41:42,550 --> 07:41:43,690
I want to be a better...

9167
07:41:43,690 --> 07:41:45,630
I guess I should position myself better.

9168
07:41:45,810 --> 07:41:48,030
I guess that's really it.

9169
07:41:48,490 --> 07:41:52,050
If I knew they have a Magneto, I'll just position myself better.

9170
07:41:53,450 --> 07:41:53,970
No!

9171
07:42:00,090 --> 07:42:02,910
I just witnessed a Titanic sinking.

9172
07:42:11,110 --> 07:42:13,190
Oh my god.

9173
07:42:13,270 --> 07:42:15,670
I just saw the Titanic sink there.

9174
07:42:16,130 --> 07:42:17,970
That was crazy.

9175
07:42:22,390 --> 07:42:23,570
Oh my god.

9176
07:42:24,270 --> 07:42:25,570
Thank you for the red!

9177
07:42:25,570 --> 07:42:27,090
I'm in a game right now.

9178
07:42:27,170 --> 07:42:27,530
I'm sorry.

9179
07:42:27,850 --> 07:42:29,150
I'll be back soon.

9180
07:42:29,590 --> 07:42:31,990
I'll do the usual stuff soon.

9181
07:42:33,990 --> 07:42:35,190
I just...

9182
07:42:35,190 --> 07:42:36,830
I gotta live.

9183
07:42:37,990 --> 07:42:40,390
Oh my god, he's healing in front of them.

9184
07:42:40,550 --> 07:42:41,510
Fucking crazy.

9185
07:42:41,830 --> 07:42:42,730
That tear doesn't heal!

9186
07:42:49,080 --> 07:42:50,540
I'm not gonna get hit.

9187
07:42:51,200 --> 07:42:51,980
I'm not...

9188
07:42:51,980 --> 07:42:52,700
Oh, the wall.

9189
07:42:52,780 --> 07:42:53,240
The map's changing.

9190
07:42:57,900 --> 07:42:59,060
They used both support ults.

9191
07:42:59,160 --> 07:43:00,260
I'm gonna go for a silent ult.

9192
07:43:00,600 --> 07:43:01,480
Win the fight here.

9193
07:43:04,660 --> 07:43:06,100
Is that Neymar's low?

9194
07:43:09,940 --> 07:43:10,580
Okay.

9195
07:43:14,850 --> 07:43:15,490
Alright.

9196
07:43:15,810 --> 07:43:16,630
Here we go!

9197
07:43:17,610 --> 07:43:19,270
I fear Magneto.

9198
07:43:20,170 --> 07:43:22,210
I'm so happy it wasn't me this time.

9199
07:43:26,080 --> 07:43:26,720
Live.

9200
07:43:28,280 --> 07:43:28,600
Live.

9201
07:43:29,780 --> 07:43:30,280
Live.

9202
07:43:31,280 --> 07:43:32,400
Just keep living.

9203
07:43:32,920 --> 07:43:33,960
Oh my god.

9204
07:43:34,100 --> 07:43:35,460
That's called prediction!

9205
07:43:38,000 --> 07:43:38,880
Jesus Christ.

9206
07:43:39,460 --> 07:43:39,980
Magics half.

9207
07:43:41,940 --> 07:43:42,620
Magics one.

9208
07:43:46,560 --> 07:43:47,300
Everything's fine!

9209
07:43:47,660 --> 07:43:47,920
See?

9210
07:43:48,960 --> 07:43:49,920
Everything's A-okay.

9211
07:43:51,120 --> 07:43:52,320
Oh, I have a C now!

9212
07:43:52,580 --> 07:43:54,420
Oh my god, I haven't played with an Iron Fist.

9213
07:43:54,520 --> 07:43:56,080
I always forget the Iron Fist team up.

9214
07:43:56,860 --> 07:43:58,020
But it's like...

9215
07:43:58,020 --> 07:44:00,740
I don't feel like I need to use it.

9216
07:44:00,740 --> 07:44:03,580
Because nobody's diving me and I just get the freeze.

9217
07:44:03,840 --> 07:44:05,140
Not that one though, but like...

9218
07:44:05,720 --> 07:44:07,020
You know, the other freeze.

9219
07:44:07,740 --> 07:44:08,920
When he's on me.

9220
07:44:11,360 --> 07:44:12,160
Jesus Christ.

9221
07:44:13,880 --> 07:44:15,260
There's a magic coming to you, Loki.

9222
07:44:20,530 --> 07:44:21,330
Don't worry!

9223
07:44:27,830 --> 07:44:29,170
You're so healthy!

9224
07:44:29,970 --> 07:44:30,650
There's a Magneto on point.

9225
07:44:30,750 --> 07:44:31,350
There's a Magneto on point.

9226
07:44:33,410 --> 07:44:34,610
Oh my god!

9227
07:44:34,790 --> 07:44:36,270
The freeze almost went off!

9228
07:44:36,790 --> 07:44:37,750
That had to be ping.

9229
07:44:39,390 --> 07:44:40,650
That had to be ping.

9230
07:44:41,110 --> 07:44:49,880
What the- Adam got the- That had- That was ping right there.

9231
07:44:50,020 --> 07:44:52,560
I heard the sound register too.

9232
07:44:54,320 --> 07:44:56,160
I heard the fucking sound register.

9233
07:44:58,700 --> 07:45:00,960
I got really cocky though, I shouldn't have done that.

9234
07:45:02,920 --> 07:45:07,500
I definitely should not have tried that.

9235
07:45:09,580 --> 07:45:11,380
That's right.

9236
07:45:16,710 --> 07:45:17,610
No,

9237
07:45:24,260 --> 07:45:25,480
I couldn't press C!

9238
07:45:26,890 --> 07:45:29,480
I'm so not used to pressing C!

9239
07:45:31,280 --> 07:45:34,200
My fingers didn't know where to go.

9240
07:45:34,200 --> 07:45:35,580
Did they use Mantis ult?

9241
07:45:36,580 --> 07:45:37,880
Oh no, they're switching to it.

9242
07:45:41,520 --> 07:45:45,920
My fingers don't know where the C button is.

9243
07:45:46,040 --> 07:45:50,160
It's not used to pressing- It's been so long since I fucking pressed the C key.

9244
07:45:54,460 --> 07:45:57,060
That was like the most hell-mary thing I've done.

9245
07:46:01,630 --> 07:46:02,930
There's a Mantis to your left.

9246
07:46:05,150 --> 07:46:06,050
Adam's low.

9247
07:46:11,680 --> 07:46:13,260
Wait, what?

9248
07:46:14,240 --> 07:46:15,720
Where's the Namor thing?

9249
07:46:18,080 --> 07:46:21,760
Wait, where's the- Oh my god, it was in the center!

9250
07:46:23,720 --> 07:46:25,280
I was like, where was that?

9251
07:46:25,660 --> 07:46:26,880
I couldn't see it.

9252
07:46:30,160 --> 07:46:31,320
I was so confused.

9253
07:46:31,320 --> 07:46:32,700
I'm tipping us down on the left.

9254
07:46:32,920 --> 07:46:35,180
I'm tipping us safe, I'm tipping us safe.

9255
07:46:35,560 --> 07:46:37,000
Yo, they're Mantis and they're Magneto.

9256
07:46:37,080 --> 07:46:38,640
We got pick, we got pick, we got Magneto.

9257
07:46:43,210 --> 07:46:44,650
Behind us, behind us, right side, right side.

9258
07:46:44,830 --> 07:46:45,610
Mantis one, Mantis low.

9259
07:46:47,710 --> 07:46:52,770
I don't have- Namor to your left.

9260
07:46:53,330 --> 07:46:54,130
I'm asleep though.

9261
07:46:57,720 --> 07:46:58,660
Drop down if you need to.

9262
07:47:01,220 --> 07:47:01,860
There's Bucky.

9263
07:47:03,760 --> 07:47:04,920
Wait, Magneto, Magneto.

9264
07:47:05,040 --> 07:47:05,660
I'm damage boosting.

9265
07:47:12,840 --> 07:47:13,320
Nice.

9266
07:47:13,620 --> 07:47:14,340
Oh, behind us!

9267
07:47:16,640 --> 07:47:18,980
Oh, it was the other side.

9268
07:47:37,560 --> 07:47:38,920
Holy shit.

9269
07:47:39,160 --> 07:47:42,300
That was a crazy berserker that he did.

9270
07:47:44,640 --> 07:47:48,120
Oh my god, back to one more game.

9271
07:47:48,980 --> 07:47:50,180
Oh, I need to sit fast, dude.

9272
07:47:50,280 --> 07:47:51,420
I'll be right back, guys.

9273
07:48:53,380 --> 07:48:54,800
Back, everybody.

9274
07:48:55,520 --> 07:48:56,440
I'm back.

9275
07:48:56,900 --> 07:49:00,940
I just realized we've been getting this Loki guy, like, consistently.

9276
07:49:02,000 --> 07:49:09,300
And like, he's like- Is Loki just farming off of Bucky on our team?

9277
07:49:10,140 --> 07:49:14,580
He's like the plus- He's like our unofficial adopted player.

9278
07:49:14,580 --> 07:49:18,780
Like, he's just- He's just always there.

9279
07:49:20,040 --> 07:49:20,920
I realized.

9280
07:49:21,560 --> 07:49:22,820
He's just tagging along.

9281
07:49:23,300 --> 07:49:24,880
The unofficial forth.

9282
07:49:28,840 --> 07:49:31,460
Oh, wait, Craigie is on the enemy team.

9283
07:49:32,680 --> 07:49:33,860
Oh, it's them!

9284
07:49:34,020 --> 07:49:35,020
It's the Widow player.

9285
07:49:37,280 --> 07:49:38,100
Also, strange.

9286
07:49:38,240 --> 07:49:39,520
Thank you for the five gifted subs.

9287
07:49:39,660 --> 07:49:40,100
Thank you, thank you.

9288
07:49:40,140 --> 07:49:41,800
And Tobias, thank you for Twitch Prime.

9289
07:49:43,680 --> 07:49:51,260
Yeah, also- Well, as I was saying- Thank you so much for the raid, Cleo.

9290
07:49:51,360 --> 07:49:52,800
For those who are new here, my name is Doki Bird.

9291
07:49:53,180 --> 07:49:56,180
I do the stream on- Sorry, oh my god, I said Twitch.

9292
07:49:56,420 --> 07:49:59,460
I do the stream on the YouTube, but-

9293
07:50:03,720 --> 07:50:09,300
Oh, they banned Hella anyway.

9294
07:50:09,300 --> 07:50:11,140
Well, at least we banned someone else.

9295
07:50:13,620 --> 07:50:15,180
I guess we ban Hawkeye.

9296
07:50:17,800 --> 07:50:19,200
Please don't ban Psylocke.

9297
07:50:19,900 --> 07:50:20,680
Let's ban Hawkeye.

9298
07:50:21,180 --> 07:50:23,560
But yeah, I'm doing my rank right now on Twitch.

9299
07:50:23,620 --> 07:50:25,260
Because I don't know how long it's going to take me.

9300
07:50:25,420 --> 07:50:29,460
But like, surprisingly- It's not as long as I thought it would take me.

9301
07:50:30,940 --> 07:50:31,720
I think.

9302
07:50:34,520 --> 07:50:35,320
I think.

9303
07:50:46,590 --> 07:50:47,170
Alright.

9304
07:50:47,850 --> 07:50:48,990
Bro, I'm down bad.

9305
07:50:49,130 --> 07:50:52,370
Drop to GM one and let's just turn it up a little bit.

9306
07:50:54,430 --> 07:50:56,510
Oh my god, Luna Mantis.

9307
07:50:56,810 --> 07:51:00,890
This is a game- We almost have the perfect comp.

9308
07:51:02,090 --> 07:51:03,550
But then we got the one tricks.

9309
07:51:08,190 --> 07:51:12,710
We were so close to the perfect comp.

9310
07:51:12,710 --> 07:51:15,090
And then it's- It's our DPS.

9311
07:51:15,850 --> 07:51:17,730
It was so close.

9312
07:51:17,990 --> 07:51:19,750
We almost got there.

9313
07:51:20,890 --> 07:51:23,130
Our DPS is Widow Iron Fist.

9314
07:51:23,530 --> 07:51:27,330
Like- We were almost full meta.

9315
07:51:29,270 --> 07:51:33,110
The Black Widow- I swear, this is my eternity game.

9316
07:51:33,230 --> 07:51:34,810
I swear to fucking god.

9317
07:51:35,210 --> 07:51:37,170
This is my eternity game.

9318
07:51:37,590 --> 07:51:39,070
Who is he fucking right now?

9319
07:51:39,590 --> 07:51:41,470
Alright, who did he pick?

9320
07:51:41,470 --> 07:51:44,630
Who is- Oh, it's just the- Oh my god, everybody.

9321
07:51:44,870 --> 07:51:46,330
I'm excited.

9322
07:51:47,870 --> 07:51:48,750
Alright, the wall.

9323
07:51:55,160 --> 07:51:57,260
You'll never die, mace.

9324
07:51:57,720 --> 07:52:01,740
I like how we never saw- We never saw Wily.

9325
07:52:01,980 --> 07:52:03,640
Oh my god!

9326
07:52:04,540 --> 07:52:06,500
We never saw Wily again.

9327
07:52:06,620 --> 07:52:08,800
I think he legitimately Q dodged.

9328
07:52:09,940 --> 07:52:11,240
What did he kill?

9329
07:52:11,240 --> 07:52:12,260
Who did our Widow kill?

9330
07:52:13,180 --> 07:52:14,420
I didn't even pay attention.

9331
07:52:14,580 --> 07:52:17,360
It happened so fast.

9332
07:52:17,440 --> 07:52:18,080
Not gonna lie.

9333
07:52:18,800 --> 07:52:20,220
Oh my god, wait, they have no heals.

9334
07:52:21,560 --> 07:52:22,200
No sleep either.

9335
07:52:24,800 --> 07:52:25,620
There's an Iron Man.

9336
07:52:25,740 --> 07:52:25,960
Frozen?

9337
07:52:30,190 --> 07:52:33,850
Alright, that- Guys, was that- Oh, Strange is low.

9338
07:52:35,710 --> 07:52:36,510
Guys, that was-

9339
07:52:42,650 --> 07:52:44,850
Strange is so- Strange is one.

9340
07:52:49,310 --> 07:52:50,430
I have ult.

9341
07:52:51,370 --> 07:52:51,970
Is it worth it?

9342
07:52:53,950 --> 07:52:54,490
Okay.

9343
07:52:57,670 --> 07:52:58,050
Alright.

9344
07:53:05,640 --> 07:53:06,400
Nice.

9345
07:53:11,020 --> 07:53:12,060
There we go.

9346
07:53:15,400 --> 07:53:15,900
Wow.

9347
07:53:16,140 --> 07:53:17,180
Oh my god.

9348
07:53:17,380 --> 07:53:19,320
Did you guys see that sick ass freeze?

9349
07:53:20,860 --> 07:53:21,860
Fucking reflexes.

9350
07:53:22,880 --> 07:53:23,300
Right there.

9351
07:53:23,380 --> 07:53:23,980
This is what I mean.

9352
07:53:24,460 --> 07:53:26,500
A Luna is so easy.

9353
07:53:26,760 --> 07:53:31,100
What makes a good Luna is literally just her- It's like, positioning and freezes.

9354
07:53:31,760 --> 07:53:32,420
I feel like.

9355
07:53:33,260 --> 07:53:41,040
I honestly feel like a really good Luna- A really good Luna has just insane- I see you, Mace.

9356
07:53:46,180 --> 07:53:46,740
Okay.

9357
07:53:55,140 --> 07:53:56,140
Alright, let's go.

9358
07:53:59,460 --> 07:54:00,020
Goodbye!

9359
07:54:05,800 --> 07:54:07,040
I froze him.

9360
07:54:07,120 --> 07:54:07,460
I froze him.

9361
07:54:17,910 --> 07:54:18,470
Bro.

9362
07:54:24,110 --> 07:54:26,950
I- I-

9363
07:54:30,720 --> 07:54:31,840
Oh my god.

9364
07:54:35,240 --> 07:54:36,760
This guy's gonna be on the list.

9365
07:54:37,180 --> 07:54:38,320
He's gonna be on Mace's list.

9366
07:54:38,420 --> 07:54:39,020
I can feel it.

9367
07:54:39,080 --> 07:54:41,980
I can feel him being mad.

9368
07:54:44,080 --> 07:54:47,640
He's gonna- That Iron Fist is gonna get on the list, guys.

9369
07:54:47,820 --> 07:54:49,440
I- I feel it.

9370
07:54:49,520 --> 07:54:51,340
I feel it so bad.

9371
07:54:51,340 --> 07:54:51,360
I feel it so bad.

9372
07:54:54,760 --> 07:54:58,380
I don't think he's happy about the Iron Fist.

9373
07:55:08,200 --> 07:55:14,220
I legitimately don't think he's happy about the fact that- Oh.

9374
07:55:14,820 --> 07:55:15,860
Oops, I missed.

9375
07:55:25,190 --> 07:55:25,870
Whoa.

9376
07:55:25,870 --> 07:55:27,070
He's five.

9377
07:55:28,470 --> 07:55:30,670
Oh my god, good for him.

9378
07:55:34,240 --> 07:55:34,840
Oh.

9379
07:55:35,480 --> 07:55:41,320
Oh my god, what?

9380
07:55:44,440 --> 07:55:48,340
I- Oh, that's- Okay.

9381
07:55:49,140 --> 07:55:50,340
Fuck me.

9382
07:55:50,940 --> 07:55:51,660
I guess.

9383
07:55:52,900 --> 07:55:57,220
I don't know- Okay.

9384
07:55:59,120 --> 07:56:02,260
I literally- Like, okay.

9385
07:56:03,600 --> 07:56:04,780
I don't know, man.

9386
07:56:05,980 --> 07:56:08,380
I don't fucking know, man.

9387
07:56:08,940 --> 07:56:10,640
I don't know.

9388
07:56:14,340 --> 07:56:16,820
I- This

9389
07:56:21,260 --> 07:56:23,280
is awkward.

9390
07:56:25,700 --> 07:56:27,920
It was nice knowing you, Iron Fist.

9391
07:56:27,920 --> 07:56:34,300
But- I don't think- I don't think you're gonna have a good rank climb after Mace is done with you.

9392
07:56:34,660 --> 07:56:40,020
I- He's so- Yeah, I think- I don't think-

9393
07:56:43,840 --> 07:56:46,260
There's a- Iron Manta, right?

9394
07:56:47,000 --> 07:56:47,440
He's half.

9395
07:56:52,910 --> 07:56:53,190
Oh.

9396
07:56:54,610 --> 07:56:55,190
You're five.

9397
07:57:07,780 --> 07:57:08,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9398
07:57:08,560 --> 07:57:08,940
Nice, nice, nice.

9399
07:57:10,300 --> 07:57:11,050
Back up, back up.

9400
07:57:15,920 --> 07:57:17,360
We're all alive.

9401
07:57:22,000 --> 07:57:23,420
We're all alive.

9402
07:57:26,040 --> 07:57:28,200
I got a little bit scared when I said that.

9403
07:57:28,480 --> 07:57:32,220
But- I was like- I still have Lunala too.

9404
07:57:33,800 --> 07:57:35,880
I was like- Oh, thank god.

9405
07:57:38,140 --> 07:57:40,000
Technically, we're all still alive.

9406
07:57:40,080 --> 07:57:40,800
We're gonna TP back.

9407
07:57:44,820 --> 07:57:46,080
They should have Strangeld.

9408
07:57:51,500 --> 07:57:52,420
He's looking for it.

9409
07:57:53,340 --> 07:57:54,240
There's Peel to our right too.

9410
07:57:55,700 --> 07:57:56,620
Iron Man one!

9411
07:57:58,440 --> 07:57:59,540
I'm gonna ult this thing.

9412
07:58:05,170 --> 07:58:06,770
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back.

9413
07:58:07,210 --> 07:58:08,290
Back, back, back, back, back.

9414
07:58:08,290 --> 07:58:10,530
Heals, I'm on the point just dancing.

9415
07:58:13,490 --> 07:58:14,550
Back, back, Magneto.

9416
07:58:14,910 --> 07:58:15,350
Magneto's one.

9417
07:58:18,290 --> 07:58:19,290
What a comm.

9418
07:58:19,510 --> 07:58:21,150
I'm just on the point dancing.

9419
07:58:21,290 --> 07:58:22,190
If you want heals.

9420
07:58:26,240 --> 07:58:26,740
Nice.

9421
07:58:28,720 --> 07:58:30,160
Who she's playing that's rank one?

9422
07:58:30,340 --> 07:58:31,820
Look at the leaderboards.

9423
07:58:32,180 --> 07:58:35,060
And look who I have my snowflake on this entire time.

9424
07:58:44,700 --> 07:58:47,560
Look who's- Look who has it.

9425
07:58:49,100 --> 07:58:50,660
Other people low HP?

9426
07:58:50,960 --> 07:58:51,300
Nah.

9427
07:59:06,000 --> 07:59:08,820
I like turn- I'm scared of like turning around.

9428
07:59:16,160 --> 07:59:17,340
Is he okay?

9429
07:59:17,900 --> 07:59:18,300
No!

9430
07:59:21,990 --> 07:59:24,830
I- I legitimately blame the widow.

9431
07:59:25,250 --> 07:59:27,370
I actually looked up.

9432
07:59:27,370 --> 07:59:27,850
No way.

9433
07:59:28,390 --> 07:59:31,050
I looked away first.

9434
07:59:31,730 --> 07:59:32,950
Oh my god.

9435
07:59:33,450 --> 07:59:35,290
I actually looked away.

9436
07:59:37,690 --> 07:59:38,890
Never again.

9437
07:59:39,550 --> 07:59:40,570
Yeah, you ult first Ruben.

9438
07:59:41,410 --> 07:59:42,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9439
07:59:42,890 --> 07:59:45,510
We can make it.

9440
07:59:48,170 --> 07:59:48,770
Yeah.

9441
07:59:49,990 --> 07:59:51,270
I don't know where he is.

9442
07:59:51,430 --> 07:59:51,990
I don't see him.

9443
07:59:52,150 --> 07:59:52,650
Oh, he's in the front.

9444
07:59:59,440 --> 08:00:00,800
He's looking for it.

9445
08:00:00,800 --> 08:00:01,760
He's looking for it.

9446
08:00:01,760 --> 08:00:02,820
He's looking all - Look above.

9447
08:00:09,680 --> 08:00:11,260
Oh my god!

9448
08:00:11,460 --> 08:00:12,600
We're alive!

9449
08:00:14,560 --> 08:00:15,580
I'm on damage.

9450
08:00:17,720 --> 08:00:18,780
I'm backing up.

9451
08:00:18,800 --> 08:00:19,400
Who's gonna be on cart?

9452
08:00:19,540 --> 08:00:19,760
Diddy.

9453
08:00:22,680 --> 08:00:23,760
Mantis should stay cart.

9454
08:00:24,840 --> 08:00:25,680
Yup, bad.

9455
08:00:30,060 --> 08:00:30,980
I'm on Saga.

9456
08:00:37,860 --> 08:00:38,840
Oh, nice!

9457
08:00:38,980 --> 08:00:39,540
No way!

9458
08:00:40,800 --> 08:00:42,160
Oh my god, thank god.

9459
08:00:43,140 --> 08:00:44,020
Thank god!

9460
08:00:45,640 --> 08:00:47,300
I'm- I just hide here.

9461
08:00:47,880 --> 08:00:54,840
I- Every time- Oh my god, if I hear- If I hear any of those fucking Magneto and Iron Man ult, I just run.

9462
08:00:54,900 --> 08:00:55,700
I don't look back.

9463
08:00:55,700 --> 08:00:57,460
I don't care if my teammates die.

9464
08:00:57,520 --> 08:00:58,500
I don't look back.

9465
08:01:00,680 --> 08:01:03,200
As long as I live.

9466
08:01:04,260 --> 08:01:05,980
That's all I care about.

9467
08:01:11,800 --> 08:01:12,720
Maximum pulse.

9468
08:01:12,880 --> 08:01:16,160
I don't think this guy- I think this guy's gonna be on Mace's list.

9469
08:01:17,760 --> 08:01:19,420
He's definitely not happy.

9470
08:01:23,880 --> 08:01:26,280
He's- He's not happy.

9471
08:01:29,160 --> 08:01:30,800
Try freeze Iron Man?

9472
08:01:31,000 --> 08:01:32,020
Oh my god.

9473
08:01:32,800 --> 08:01:35,300
Okay, I froze Iron Man.

9474
08:01:35,420 --> 08:01:40,100
I did like some insane fucking freezes on that guy in this game alone.

9475
08:01:44,970 --> 08:01:49,410
Literally in this game alone I did some sick ass freezes on Iron Man.

9476
08:01:49,410 --> 08:01:51,610
But it's like, it's so risky.

9477
08:01:55,630 --> 08:02:12,290
Not something I would like to hear from the healer, but if it- Look, as somebody that's taken a fucking meteor and a fucking maximum pulse bomb to the face for the past 8 hours I'm just happy to be alive.

9478
08:02:17,120 --> 08:02:18,200
Iron Man's going low.

9479
08:02:19,420 --> 08:02:21,560
Oh my god, the Widow talks?

9480
08:02:24,000 --> 08:02:26,080
I didn't realize he talks.

9481
08:02:33,710 --> 08:02:35,170
He is a person!

9482
08:02:36,730 --> 08:02:37,890
No way!

9483
08:02:38,830 --> 08:02:40,270
He's a real person.

9484
08:02:43,880 --> 08:02:45,020
Who is he?

9485
08:02:45,960 --> 08:02:47,620
He added me and I said yes.

9486
08:02:47,620 --> 08:02:49,160
Because he's good.

9487
08:02:51,560 --> 08:02:54,460
I saw- He's fucking insane.

9488
08:03:01,140 --> 08:03:02,700
You know what I'm surprised by?

9489
08:03:02,800 --> 08:03:03,940
The lack of Luna bands.

9490
08:03:04,320 --> 08:03:04,640
Honestly.

9491
08:03:05,640 --> 08:03:08,920
Everybody just- Maybe these hours are just fucked in general.

9492
08:03:09,960 --> 08:03:12,560
This is like the least amount of Luna bands I've ever had.

9493
08:03:14,180 --> 08:03:16,800
That was a great prediction for me.

9494
08:03:25,380 --> 08:03:26,120
Oh my god.

9495
08:03:26,760 --> 08:03:27,400
There's a Black Panther!

9496
08:03:27,540 --> 08:03:27,820
There's a Black Panther!

9497
08:03:27,900 --> 08:03:28,260
I'm ulting.

9498
08:03:36,620 --> 08:03:36,940
Yeah...

9499
08:03:36,940 --> 08:03:38,360
I have 3 seconds left.

9500
08:03:46,180 --> 08:03:47,980
Oh my god, I'm fucking focusing so hard.

9501
08:03:49,100 --> 08:03:49,700
He has Strange ult.

9502
08:04:00,760 --> 08:04:01,700
I'll ult this.

9503
08:04:02,500 --> 08:04:03,320
I froze Strange.

9504
08:04:03,440 --> 08:04:04,280
He has ult, by the way.

9505
08:04:05,580 --> 08:04:06,720
I'm gonna stay here.

9506
08:04:06,820 --> 08:04:09,400
I swear to god, if I see this rock in- Okay, nice.

9507
08:04:09,560 --> 08:04:10,760
Okay, not nice.

9508
08:04:10,880 --> 08:04:12,040
Everybody's dying.

9509
08:04:15,240 --> 08:04:16,540
Oh, it's just us two.

9510
08:04:20,000 --> 08:04:20,360
Alright.

9511
08:04:24,560 --> 08:04:25,520
He's so healthy.

9512
08:04:25,520 --> 08:04:26,480
He's not a bad hold.

9513
08:04:28,900 --> 08:04:29,680
He's so healthy.

9514
08:04:35,570 --> 08:04:38,290
We should have Black Panther ult and Strange ult.

9515
08:04:38,870 --> 08:04:40,370
Actually, majority of the ults.

9516
08:04:42,410 --> 08:04:43,610
They don't have Mag ult.

9517
08:04:44,070 --> 08:04:44,430
They don't?

9518
08:04:44,590 --> 08:04:44,790
Oh.

9519
08:04:46,550 --> 08:04:47,390
Black Panther!

9520
08:04:49,710 --> 08:04:50,630
I've had one!

9521
08:04:51,290 --> 08:04:52,590
I'm ulting this to stabilize.

9522
08:05:01,800 --> 08:05:02,360
Oh!

9523
08:05:07,640 --> 08:05:08,200
Oh!

9524
08:05:08,200 --> 08:05:09,060
Oh, he didn't get frozen.

9525
08:05:09,420 --> 08:05:10,000
I'm dead here.

9526
08:05:15,760 --> 08:05:16,940
He's still alive.

9527
08:05:21,600 --> 08:05:22,940
Who says I am?

9528
08:05:31,940 --> 08:05:32,820
He died.

9529
08:05:32,820 --> 08:05:34,600
We all died for our sins.

9530
08:05:45,340 --> 08:05:46,700
Okay, okay.

9531
08:05:52,620 --> 08:05:53,860
The Luna's to your right.

9532
08:05:55,580 --> 08:05:56,720
Magic slow too.

9533
08:05:56,720 --> 08:05:59,120
I am ready to put on a show!

9534
08:06:03,970 --> 08:06:05,330
Can we kill Magic?

9535
08:06:06,790 --> 08:06:07,370
Magic's one!

9536
08:06:07,430 --> 08:06:07,850
Magic's one!

9537
08:06:08,030 --> 08:06:08,750
Oh, he's healed.

9538
08:06:11,210 --> 08:06:12,210
They're on me now.

9539
08:06:13,170 --> 08:06:13,970
Oh, goodbye.

9540
08:06:15,790 --> 08:06:17,050
I res, I res, I res.

9541
08:06:22,130 --> 08:06:23,130
Oh, Magnio's one!

9542
08:06:24,790 --> 08:06:26,570
Oh, he got healed.

9543
08:06:33,780 --> 08:06:34,260
Goodbye.

9544
08:06:34,260 --> 08:06:35,240
Bye.

9545
08:06:36,480 --> 08:06:36,940
Goodbye.

9546
08:06:37,740 --> 08:06:40,580
Oh, we have Neymar!

9547
08:06:41,300 --> 08:06:41,600
Okay, bet.

9548
08:06:41,980 --> 08:06:43,600
Oh, he's still...

9549
08:06:43,600 --> 08:06:44,360
Oh

9550
08:06:47,460 --> 08:06:49,780
my god.

9551
08:06:50,280 --> 08:06:52,300
He got freed of the fucking list.

9552
08:06:53,440 --> 08:06:55,980
The Iron Fist one trick actually swapped.

9553
08:06:57,380 --> 08:06:58,500
That's crazy.

9554
08:07:08,300 --> 08:07:10,260
That's actually crazy.

9555
08:07:10,980 --> 08:07:11,980
He is scared.

9556
08:07:12,440 --> 08:07:13,860
He is so scared.

9557
08:07:13,860 --> 08:07:16,040
He knows who's streaming right now.

9558
08:07:16,140 --> 08:07:18,460
There's Strange up top and he's...

9559
08:07:18,460 --> 08:07:19,680
Oh, I'm sorry.

9560
08:07:19,940 --> 08:07:22,700
My scroll wheel is still up.

9561
08:07:26,280 --> 08:07:30,900
I froze Strange.

9562
08:07:33,940 --> 08:07:34,680
I forgot.

9563
08:07:34,960 --> 08:07:36,620
I forgot about my scroll wheel.

9564
08:07:41,540 --> 08:07:42,560
Oh, backline is one!

9565
08:07:44,980 --> 08:07:46,440
I'm not the Lunatic!

9566
08:07:46,700 --> 08:07:47,960
It's so risky!

9567
08:07:50,240 --> 08:07:52,100
It's actually so...

9568
08:07:52,100 --> 08:07:53,120
Oh my god.

9569
08:07:53,540 --> 08:07:54,200
It's so...

9570
08:07:54,720 --> 08:07:56,380
I need to unbind the scroll wheel.

9571
08:07:56,800 --> 08:07:57,740
I was trying to ping.

9572
08:08:09,310 --> 08:08:10,670
Jesus Christ.

9573
08:08:19,180 --> 08:08:20,500
I have ult soon.

9574
08:08:25,940 --> 08:08:26,780
I have ult soon.

9575
08:08:26,780 --> 08:08:27,100
I froze somebody.

9576
08:08:27,640 --> 08:08:28,060
I have ult.

9577
08:08:32,300 --> 08:08:33,200
They're all really low.

9578
08:08:37,340 --> 08:08:38,780
Three seconds is gone.

9579
08:08:47,580 --> 08:08:49,300
Oh my god.

9580
08:08:49,300 --> 08:08:49,560
Oh my god.

9581
08:08:55,640 --> 08:08:57,900
Oh, that's huge!

9582
08:09:04,320 --> 08:09:05,420
Do they have Strange ult?

9583
08:09:09,400 --> 08:09:10,660
Yeah, they do have Strange ult.

9584
08:09:11,320 --> 08:09:15,620
Alright, they should have Magical too.

9585
08:09:16,380 --> 08:09:17,880
We need to hold coast.

9586
08:09:17,880 --> 08:09:18,480
We don't have any ult.

9587
08:09:20,640 --> 08:09:22,880
Yo, back up, back up, back up.

9588
08:09:23,160 --> 08:09:23,760
Oh, no, no, no!

9589
08:09:23,800 --> 08:09:24,640
Hold fucking close!

9590
08:09:28,000 --> 08:09:28,800
He angry!

9591
08:09:30,800 --> 08:09:31,600
He angry!

9592
08:09:33,740 --> 08:09:34,820
Strange point behind me!

9593
08:09:39,060 --> 08:09:39,960
He's trying to look.

9594
08:09:40,340 --> 08:09:40,700
Lunas one!

9595
08:09:40,780 --> 08:09:41,260
Lunas one!

9596
08:09:48,160 --> 08:09:49,000
I need to reload.

9597
08:09:50,600 --> 08:09:51,800
I have a magic on me.

9598
08:09:54,420 --> 08:09:56,340
I know Adam too.

9599
08:09:58,320 --> 08:09:59,600
I'm dead here, I think.

9600
08:10:07,650 --> 08:10:08,510
I'm so low.

9601
08:10:12,830 --> 08:10:14,310
I can get support here.

9602
08:10:20,230 --> 08:10:21,170
Just live, Adam.

9603
08:10:24,490 --> 08:10:24,630
It has to be me.

9604
08:10:26,050 --> 08:10:27,150
It has to be somebody.

9605
08:10:30,730 --> 08:10:31,910
I have ult, I have ult, I have ult!

9606
08:10:32,270 --> 08:10:32,870
Stand on my ult.

9607
08:10:43,040 --> 08:10:43,960
We have to pick, we have to pick.

9608
08:10:46,280 --> 08:10:47,600
I froze Strange, I froze Strange.

9609
08:10:47,700 --> 08:10:48,360
I have to back up now.

9610
08:10:51,860 --> 08:10:53,180
Oh my god, Strange on me.

9611
08:11:01,650 --> 08:11:02,230
I need to reload.

9612
08:11:06,310 --> 08:11:08,770
Strange behind you!

9613
08:11:11,090 --> 08:11:13,570
I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it!

9614
08:11:15,790 --> 08:11:16,950
I'm dead for it though.

9615
08:11:19,310 --> 08:11:20,910
Oh my god!

9616
08:11:22,190 --> 08:11:23,130
It's just magic!

9617
08:11:24,570 --> 08:11:26,310
Oh my god!

9618
08:11:29,670 --> 08:11:31,270
Take Canyon!

9619
08:11:32,410 --> 08:11:34,270
Oh my god!

9620
08:11:34,270 --> 08:11:35,990
We're all here!

9621
08:11:37,110 --> 08:11:38,740
Oh my god!

9622
08:11:42,610 --> 08:11:44,150
Oh my god!

9623
08:11:44,190 --> 08:11:46,250
What a fucking crazy...

9624
08:11:46,250 --> 08:11:48,530
That was a crazy fucking game.

9625
08:11:48,950 --> 08:11:51,030
That was actually...

9626
08:11:57,590 --> 08:11:58,630
That's me!

9627
08:12:03,980 --> 08:12:06,180
Oh my god, it's me!

9628
08:12:06,980 --> 08:12:08,160
That's actually me!

9629
08:12:08,160 --> 08:12:10,520
I fucking did it!

9630
08:12:10,580 --> 08:12:12,020
Oh my god!

9631
08:12:12,280 --> 08:12:14,320
I fucking did it!

9632
08:12:15,280 --> 08:12:16,260
Oh my god!

9633
08:12:16,560 --> 08:12:18,340
So what if we just lose it right now?

9634
08:12:26,340 --> 08:12:28,400
Oh my god!

9635
08:12:28,540 --> 08:12:28,840
Look!

9636
08:12:29,960 --> 08:12:30,940
There I am!

9637
08:12:34,160 --> 08:12:35,940
Oh my god!

9638
08:12:35,940 --> 08:12:38,820
Oh my god!

9639
08:12:38,820 --> 08:12:39,720
Shout out to Mace!

9640
08:12:39,880 --> 08:12:42,100
Shout out to Mace and Ruben!

9641
08:12:42,540 --> 08:12:44,240

9643

08:13:04,620 --> 08:13:06,260
If they're still awake...

9649
08:13:06,260 --> 08:13:09,360
If they're still awake...

9650
08:13:09,360 --> 08:13:12,620
Oh my god!

9651
08:13:12,660 --> 08:13:13,660
I'm so happy!

9652
08:13:14,260 --> 08:13:15,940
I'm so fucking happy!

9653
08:13:16,120 --> 08:13:17,760
Oh my god!

9654
08:13:17,900 --> 08:13:18,940
We were here!

9655
08:13:19,560 --> 08:13:21,420
We were fucking here!

9656
08:13:21,980 --> 08:13:24,380
Jesus Christ!

9657
08:13:25,040 --> 08:13:26,020
Okay, give me a sec.

9658
08:13:26,100 --> 08:13:29,700
Let me move over a little bit.

9659
08:13:30,160 --> 08:13:32,320
Oh my god, thank you!

9660
08:13:32,320 --> 08:13:35,140
Hey, there's me right there!

9661
08:13:35,320 --> 08:13:37,100
Oh my god, there I am!

There I am!

9663
08:13:39,680 --> 08:13:41,860
Oh my god!

9664
08:13:42,980 --> 08:13:44,260
Thank you, numbers!

9665
08:13:44,800 --> 08:13:46,920

08:13:50,640 --> 08:13:51,520
Oh!

9669
08:13:52,120 --> 08:13:53,420
No, it's not over!

9670
08:13:54,240 --> 08:13:57,020
There's still top 500 left!

9671
08:13:57,080 --> 08:13:58,720
There's still one above all!

9672
08:13:59,600 --> 08:14:01,000
And top 500!

9673
08:14:01,000 --> 08:14:03,340
It's not over!

It's not over, everybody!

9678
08:14:16,160 --> 08:14:18,700
Now it's on the top 500!

9679
08:14:20,940 --> 08:14:23,660
The ride never ends!

9680
08:14:24,400 --> 08:14:25,630
The ride never ends!

9681
08:14:31,000 --> 08:14:31,520
We did it!

9682
08:14:31,600 --> 08:14:32,440
We were all here!

9683
08:14:33,240 --> 08:14:38,120
That was a crazy win though!

9684
08:14:38,580 --> 08:14:39,750
Holy fuck!

9685
08:14:40,520 --> 08:14:42,700
That last match...

9686
08:14:42,700 --> 08:14:45,120
My fucking touch for the cart...

9687
08:14:45,120 --> 08:14:47,420
My run for the cart...

9688
08:14:47,420 --> 08:14:50,100
So that my DPS and tank...

9689
08:14:50,100 --> 08:14:53,300
Can do their big ass fucking strange ult...

9690
08:14:53,300 --> 08:14:55,440
And just slap the people on cart...

9691
08:14:55,440 --> 08:14:56,760
Was fucking crazy!

9692
08:14:57,520 --> 08:14:58,980
Oh my god!

9693
08:14:59,120 --> 08:15:00,420
The fact that like...

9694
08:15:00,420 --> 08:15:00,860
The fact that like...

9695
08:15:00,860 --> 08:15:02,600
It was 0.0!

9696
08:15:02,600 --> 08:15:03,500
I was like screaming!

9697
08:15:03,680 --> 08:15:05,040
I was like I'm going in!

9698
08:15:05,520 --> 08:15:07,180
I'm gonna touch it!

9699
08:15:09,860 --> 08:15:13,120

08:15:15,300 --> 08:15:20,880
The 0.07 touch to get a huge shout out to Mason Rubin!

9702
08:15:21,580 --> 08:15:24,920
Did my mods do their shout out yet?

9703
08:15:25,260 --> 08:15:27,340
I don't remember, but like...

9704
08:15:27,780 --> 08:15:31,100
Did they do the shout out to their channels if they're still around?

9705
08:15:31,220 --> 08:15:33,860
We win this mystery today!

9706
08:15:35,800 --> 08:15:37,300
Oh my god!

9707
08:15:37,400 --> 08:15:38,760
Are my mods even alive?

9708
08:15:38,840 --> 08:15:40,240
I don't think they're alive anymore.

9709
08:15:40,480 --> 08:15:42,900
I don't think they're alive!

9710
08:15:44,100 --> 08:15:46,360
We've been going at it for a while.

9711
08:15:46,500 --> 08:15:47,740
I'm not surprised.

9712
08:15:48,000 --> 08:15:48,140
Alright.

9713
08:15:49,700 --> 08:15:52,700
Huge shout out to Mendo for letting me poach Mace.

9714
08:15:56,000 --> 08:16:02,400
Huge shout out to Mendo for letting me poach him into my own squad.

9715
08:16:02,860 --> 08:16:04,120
I think this is Mace.

9716
08:16:04,180 --> 08:16:05,100
Is Mace just Mace?

9717
08:16:05,220 --> 08:16:06,160
I'm gonna look up Mace.

9718
08:16:06,900 --> 08:16:07,380
Mace.

9719
08:16:09,700 --> 08:16:13,800
Is it Mace or like M4CE?

9720
08:16:14,960 --> 08:16:15,480
M4CE.

9721
08:16:17,620 --> 08:16:19,800
Oh, Mace is just Mace.

9722
08:16:20,040 --> 08:16:21,940
Wait, you are the Brig 1!

9723
08:16:22,080 --> 08:16:23,820
Wait, are you the Brig 1 trick Mace?

9724
08:16:24,460 --> 08:16:24,780
Are you?

9725
08:16:26,060 --> 08:16:27,300
No, okay, you're tank.

9726
08:16:27,380 --> 08:16:28,300
Okay, I just saw...

9727
08:16:29,280 --> 08:16:32,740
Wait, you're the Brig 1 trick Mace?

9728
08:16:33,240 --> 08:16:34,060
That's you?

9729
08:16:34,680 --> 08:16:35,940
Oh my god.

9730
08:16:37,140 --> 08:16:39,060
Oh no, you were the former tank player.

9731
08:16:39,160 --> 08:16:40,680
Oh, you were Mace in the face!

9732
08:16:40,740 --> 08:16:41,800
That was you?

9733
08:16:42,620 --> 08:16:43,680
Oh my god.

9734
08:16:44,060 --> 08:16:45,100
I can't believe that was you.

9735
08:16:45,240 --> 08:16:45,640
I hate it.

9736
08:16:45,700 --> 08:16:46,160
No, I'm joking.

9737
08:16:48,220 --> 08:16:51,220
I definitely avoided the count once at least.

9738
08:16:54,900 --> 08:16:55,860
I...

9739
08:16:55,860 --> 08:17:00,480
I definitely avoided Mace to the face at least once.

9740
08:17:08,680 --> 08:17:11,760
No, okay.

9741
08:17:11,980 --> 08:17:14,260
Oh my god.

9742
08:17:16,260 --> 08:17:18,320
Oh my god.

9743
08:17:19,480 --> 08:17:25,320
I can't believe he is the Brig 1 tank player.

9744
08:17:26,240 --> 08:17:28,140
It's okay, he's reformed now.

9745
08:17:28,260 --> 08:17:29,660
Now he's back on Strange.

9746
08:17:30,000 --> 08:17:32,480
Now he's back on Strange and Magneto.

9747
08:17:32,920 --> 08:17:34,100
He's reformed now.

9748
08:17:34,220 --> 08:17:36,660
But yes, he would shout out to... No!

9749
08:17:36,800 --> 08:17:38,500
I was joking.

9750
08:17:39,000 --> 08:17:41,860
I was just a hee-haw banter.

9751
08:17:42,660 --> 08:17:44,780
Please Mace, I just got here.

9752
08:17:45,180 --> 08:17:46,940
I just got here.

9753
08:17:52,140 --> 08:17:53,360
Oh my god.

9754
08:17:53,620 --> 08:17:54,800
I was joking.

9755
08:17:55,060 --> 08:17:56,800
Come on, I even followed you.

9756
08:17:57,100 --> 08:17:59,080
I even followed you.

9757
08:17:59,300 --> 08:18:00,160
Come on.

9758
08:18:00,620 --> 08:18:01,540
Come on, man.

9759
08:18:06,840 --> 08:18:08,280
Oh my god.

9760
08:18:10,420 --> 08:18:11,400
Oh my god.

9761
08:18:11,400 --> 08:18:13,400
Shout out to Mace and Ruben.

9762
08:18:13,880 --> 08:18:14,840
The DPS.

9763
08:18:15,400 --> 08:18:17,500
Remember to adopt a tank today.

9764
08:18:18,340 --> 08:18:20,860
Adopt your fellow tank to climb.

9765
08:18:23,760 --> 08:18:24,980
Oh my god.

9766
08:18:25,380 --> 08:18:26,180
I knew it.

9767
08:18:26,240 --> 08:18:27,640
That was the dream combo.

9768
08:18:28,420 --> 08:18:30,940
Just put an orb on the tank player.

9769
08:18:31,260 --> 08:18:32,660
Farm your ult off of them.

9770
08:18:32,880 --> 08:18:34,620
Just let them fucking go at it.

9771
08:18:35,180 --> 08:18:37,120
And then press Q.

9772
08:18:41,440 --> 08:18:42,640
Thank you.

9773
08:18:42,640 --> 08:18:44,580
God, that's me right now.

9774
08:18:44,580 --> 08:18:46,060
Twitch Prime.

9775
08:18:46,280 --> 08:18:48,060
Thank you.

9776
08:18:48,760 --> 08:18:50,240
Oh my god, we did it.

9777
08:18:50,280 --> 08:18:51,940
Someone screenshot real quick.

9778
08:18:52,380 --> 08:18:54,200
I'm gonna screenshot my own screenshot.

9779
08:18:54,340 --> 08:18:56,420
Let me hide it real quick.

9780
08:18:56,540 --> 08:18:59,720
I need to screenshot this and goodbye chat.

9781
08:19:02,180 --> 08:19:03,380
I gotta...

9782
08:19:03,380 --> 08:19:04,720
That's me.

9783
08:19:05,760 --> 08:19:09,760
I gotta do that and then welcome back chat.

9784
08:19:09,920 --> 08:19:12,000
Let me tweet that right now.

9785
08:19:13,360 --> 08:19:15,820
Let me tweet that right now.

9786
08:19:22,980 --> 08:19:24,800
Oh my god.

9787
08:19:25,520 --> 08:19:28,540
Remember to adopt a fellow tank today.

9788
08:19:35,800 --> 08:19:39,500
Now on to one above all.

9789
08:19:39,700 --> 08:19:41,480
Which is just 24 hours, but still.

9790
08:19:42,080 --> 08:19:50,400
Now on to Now we go for one above all.

9791
08:19:50,820 --> 08:19:52,440
Slash top 500.

9792
08:19:56,160 --> 08:19:58,100
Did I spell Ruben's name wrong?

9793
08:19:58,860 --> 08:19:59,580
Ruben.

9794
08:19:59,860 --> 08:20:00,660
No, I didn't.

9795
08:20:00,840 --> 08:20:01,900
Nice, I did it.

9796
08:20:02,760 --> 08:20:05,200
Okay, we're not top 10, guys.

9797
08:20:10,100 --> 08:20:12,380
Oh my god, it's...

9798
08:20:12,380 --> 08:20:15,680
Thank you Mendo for letting me poach mace.

9799
08:20:15,940 --> 08:20:17,820
I really appreciate it.

9800
08:20:18,340 --> 08:20:19,780
I wonder if they're climbing.

9801
08:20:20,880 --> 08:20:21,500
I wonder.

9802
08:20:24,810 --> 08:20:25,770
I wonder.

9803
08:20:26,230 --> 08:20:27,210
Give me a sec.

9804
08:20:27,590 --> 08:20:28,170
We got it.

9805
08:20:28,190 --> 08:20:29,150
Oh, I'm plus 34.

9806
08:20:30,190 --> 08:20:30,510
Wow!

9807
08:20:31,650 --> 08:20:36,090
I mean, we could actually, technically if you think about it...

9808
08:20:36,090 --> 08:20:37,070
Wait, what's top 500?

9809
08:20:40,650 --> 08:20:44,030
Oh, that's like 5, 6, 7...

9810
08:20:44,030 --> 08:20:44,630
That's like 3 wins.

9811
08:20:44,730 --> 08:20:45,810
I don't know about that.

9812
08:20:45,890 --> 08:20:47,950
Not at 8.42am.

9813
08:20:48,170 --> 08:20:48,690
Technically!

9814
08:20:49,870 --> 08:20:50,270
Oh, you see?

9815
08:20:55,070 --> 08:20:56,590
Oh shit, Wavy!

9816
08:21:01,520 --> 08:21:02,700
Aww, Wavy!

9817
08:21:03,800 --> 08:21:04,900
What happened after?

9818
08:21:04,940 --> 08:21:05,560
Oh, he limited.

9819
08:21:06,720 --> 08:21:10,120
It's only 3 more wins, technically.

9820
08:21:10,880 --> 08:21:14,120
Wouldn't it be fucking crazy if I just lose Eternity?

9821
08:21:15,880 --> 08:21:20,620
If I just lose Eternity right there?

9822
08:21:21,000 --> 08:21:25,680
Oh my god.

9823
08:21:25,960 --> 08:21:27,500
Wouldn't that be fucking crazy?

9824
08:21:28,060 --> 08:21:29,340
Holy shit!

9825
08:21:30,100 --> 08:21:31,680
Oh my god!

9826
08:21:31,780 --> 08:21:33,280
Alright, let me check out Mendo's progress.

9827
08:21:34,620 --> 08:21:36,200
I know he's playing with HotSick.

9828
08:21:45,100 --> 08:21:46,480
Not that bad.

9829
08:21:47,280 --> 08:21:47,780
Oh!

9830
08:21:52,780 --> 08:21:53,420
Oh!

9831
08:21:53,960 --> 08:21:55,000
Wait, is Spu...

9832
08:21:55,000 --> 08:21:56,180
Wait, let me check Spu.

9833
08:21:57,480 --> 08:21:58,460
Okay, wait, Mace.

9834
08:21:58,740 --> 08:22:00,080
Which squad was that?

9835
08:22:01,980 --> 08:22:03,200
So what?

9836
08:22:03,860 --> 08:22:08,180
Okay, I'll also shout out Mendo for letting me poach Mace.

9837
08:22:08,520 --> 08:22:12,080
Because like, legitimately Mace is fucking insane.

9838
08:22:18,780 --> 08:22:19,400
What happened?

9839
08:22:20,500 --> 08:22:21,600
Oh my god.

9840
08:22:21,920 --> 08:22:23,100
I have Mace.

9841
08:22:23,160 --> 08:22:25,220
I can't just ask them to keep going.

9842
08:22:25,440 --> 08:22:26,440
What if they have to sleep?

9843
08:22:28,040 --> 08:22:28,880
What happened?

9844
08:22:29,820 --> 08:22:31,740
Oh my... Do we... I can't...

9845
08:22:31,740 --> 08:22:34,180
Okay, this is Mace and Ruben's decision.

9846
08:22:34,420 --> 08:22:36,480
We read in-game chat.

9847
08:22:38,160 --> 08:22:39,300
We're getting Doki.

9848
08:22:39,420 --> 08:22:42,180
We found it and we did and now she's out there playing more.

9849
08:22:42,240 --> 08:22:44,620
I am a slave and it's over!

9850
08:22:49,040 --> 08:22:51,460
I did one damage!

9851
08:22:51,660 --> 08:22:59,520
You played with me for like two to three hours and that felt like 850 miles.

9852
08:23:05,860 --> 08:23:07,940
Intention serpent dude.

9853
08:23:08,440 --> 08:23:09,560
Oh my god.

9854
08:23:10,860 --> 08:23:14,600
Okay, but do we really end on a win streak though?

9855
08:23:14,900 --> 08:23:15,460
Do we really?

9856
08:23:15,460 --> 08:23:16,660
Oh my god.

9857
08:23:16,720 --> 08:23:18,420
I could literally lose Top 500.

9858
08:23:18,700 --> 08:23:20,580
Like lose Eternity right now.

9859
08:23:20,720 --> 08:23:21,760
That would be so silly.

9860
08:23:22,380 --> 08:23:23,920
That would be so fucking silly.

9861
08:23:26,920 --> 08:23:28,520
Look, okay.

9862
08:23:29,040 --> 08:23:29,760
Q, okay!

9863
08:23:30,220 --> 08:23:32,260
Look, Mace says Q.

9864
08:23:32,460 --> 08:23:34,100
Alright, if we lose, we're out.

9865
08:23:34,380 --> 08:23:38,480
Because I have 34 points of like... I can have one loss.

9866
08:23:38,900 --> 08:23:40,200
I get one loss.

9867
08:23:45,460 --> 08:23:47,120
I get one loss.

9868
08:23:48,100 --> 08:23:50,180
Exactly, we can't end on a win.

9869
08:23:50,280 --> 08:23:50,920
Let's go.

9870
08:23:51,460 --> 08:23:52,480
Let's fucking go.

9871
08:23:53,020 --> 08:23:54,040
Mace has spoken.

9872
08:23:54,620 --> 08:23:57,040
Mace has fucking spoken.

9873
08:23:58,980 --> 08:23:59,660
Alright.

9874
08:24:00,260 --> 08:24:02,120
If we lose, we stop.

9875
08:24:03,520 --> 08:24:05,920
If we lose, we stop.

9876
08:24:07,780 --> 08:24:10,200
Exactly, gamblers quit early.

9877
08:24:10,760 --> 08:24:12,520
Okay, I need to be like...

9878
08:24:12,520 --> 08:24:24,660
I need to be like Let me be like Thanks Mendo for letting me poach Mace.

9879
08:24:27,760 --> 08:24:31,320
It truly was game changing.

9880
08:24:38,400 --> 08:24:41,840
Oh my god.

9881
08:24:42,000 --> 08:24:43,800
No, we lose?

9882
08:24:43,800 --> 08:24:49,780
If we lose the next game, we literally start to...

9883
08:24:49,780 --> 08:24:51,880
What do you mean?

9884
08:24:53,520 --> 08:24:57,680
Nice, I love you and I've only had Jeff since he left.

9885
08:24:57,920 --> 08:24:59,460
Oh my god.

9886
08:24:59,740 --> 08:25:00,760
How does that mean?

9887
08:25:00,820 --> 08:25:02,140
I'm thanking him.

9888
08:25:02,620 --> 08:25:04,200
I'm thanking him.

9889
08:25:06,120 --> 08:25:08,060
Oh my god.

9890
08:25:10,600 --> 08:25:12,420
Poor Mendo.

9891
08:25:13,800 --> 08:25:15,380
Also, here's Mendo's...

9892
08:25:15,380 --> 08:25:17,440
Here's Mendo's...

9893
08:25:18,200 --> 08:25:19,960
Here's Mendo's stream too.

9894
08:25:20,060 --> 08:25:21,860
Shout out to Mendo too.

9895
08:25:22,320 --> 08:25:23,080
It was him.

9896
08:25:23,320 --> 08:25:28,400
It was because of him that we were able to accomplish this.

9897
08:25:29,880 --> 08:25:30,320
Alright.

9898
08:25:32,120 --> 08:25:32,820
Man.

9899
08:25:33,840 --> 08:25:35,000
That's rough though.

9900
08:25:35,340 --> 08:25:37,180
That's rough, buddy.

9901
08:25:37,920 --> 08:25:38,720
I can't.

9902
08:25:38,760 --> 08:25:40,100
He's three stacking.

9903
08:25:40,520 --> 08:25:41,680
I can't.

9904
08:25:42,340 --> 08:25:42,780
Wait.

9905
08:25:43,300 --> 08:25:43,480
Wait.

9906
08:25:43,700 --> 08:25:48,260
We can six stack, but that might be...

9907
08:25:48,260 --> 08:25:49,900
It might take 20 years.

9908
08:25:51,320 --> 08:25:54,220
It might take 20 years before...

9909
08:25:54,220 --> 08:25:56,280
Yeah, if you guys want to know what rank one player...

9910
08:25:56,280 --> 08:25:59,140
No, six stack takes a long time in this ELO apparently.

9911
08:25:59,760 --> 08:26:03,580
It takes an incredibly long time from what I've heard.

9912
08:26:03,920 --> 08:26:04,720
I don't know though.

9913
08:26:04,820 --> 08:26:06,080
I'm not in this ELO often.

9914
08:26:06,740 --> 08:26:08,700
Like, this is literally my...

9915
08:26:09,420 --> 08:26:10,460
I don't know.

9916
08:26:10,580 --> 08:26:11,740
I just got here.

9917
08:26:11,860 --> 08:26:13,220
I just got Eternity.

9918
08:26:13,480 --> 08:26:14,560
I don't know.

9919
08:26:17,300 --> 08:26:18,600
Only Mace knows.

9920
08:26:19,040 --> 08:26:21,480
He's like the actual person that knows.

9921
08:26:24,440 --> 08:26:25,280
Oh my god.

9922
08:26:25,320 --> 08:26:27,280
We don't have to ban Hulk.

9923
08:26:28,120 --> 08:26:29,740
We actually have a Hulk player.

9924
08:26:29,920 --> 08:26:31,980
This is the real Mace to face.

9925
08:26:32,460 --> 08:26:32,860
Wow.

9926
08:26:33,020 --> 08:26:33,740
Oh my god.

9927
08:26:33,740 --> 08:26:34,540
He's famous.

9928
08:26:35,740 --> 08:26:36,740
I'm here too.

9929
08:26:38,700 --> 08:26:40,240
Inside my chest.

9930
08:26:45,580 --> 08:26:46,780
I'm here.

9931
08:26:47,200 --> 08:26:48,100
Hi, I'm Doki.

9932
08:26:50,020 --> 08:26:51,220
I'm Doki bird.

9933
08:26:52,980 --> 08:26:53,880
Doki who?

9934
08:26:54,920 --> 08:26:56,080
Oh my god.

9935
08:26:56,120 --> 08:26:57,120
Is this...

9936
08:26:57,120 --> 08:26:58,940
Oh, you're the brig guy.

9937
08:27:02,720 --> 08:27:05,420
I like how everybody knows who he is.

9938
08:27:05,840 --> 08:27:06,640
Wait, what do we ban?

9939
08:27:06,640 --> 08:27:08,220
What do we ban?

9940
08:27:08,700 --> 08:27:10,220
I never got this far.

9941
08:27:11,460 --> 08:27:13,360
I never got this far.

9942
08:27:14,840 --> 08:27:15,900
Doctor Strange?

9943
08:27:16,080 --> 08:27:16,980
Let's fucking do it.

9944
08:27:17,120 --> 08:27:17,640
Let's go.

9945
08:27:18,160 --> 08:27:18,280
Oh.

9946
08:27:20,320 --> 08:27:20,940
Oh.

9947
08:27:22,280 --> 08:27:23,360
We need somebody to go Iron Man.

9948
08:27:27,040 --> 08:27:28,660
Iron Man now.

9949
08:27:29,020 --> 08:27:29,140
Yeah.

9950
08:27:30,140 --> 08:27:30,760
Perfect.

9951
08:27:31,320 --> 08:27:32,780
Alright, this is it.

9952
08:27:37,960 --> 08:27:38,720
Doki.

9953
08:27:38,940 --> 08:27:40,200
Doki, that's your Q.

9954
08:27:44,420 --> 08:27:46,000
This is my game.

9955
08:27:46,780 --> 08:27:48,860
Do you take prize?

9956
08:27:51,800 --> 08:27:55,220
Bro, he's like some fucking terrorist or some shit.

9957
08:27:58,180 --> 08:28:00,260
Everyone's like, fuck, it's him.

9958
08:28:00,860 --> 08:28:01,420
Scatter.

9959
08:28:02,180 --> 08:28:03,340
It's fucking him.

9960
08:28:03,720 --> 08:28:04,480
Scatter.

9961
08:28:07,880 --> 08:28:10,240
Time for the best character.

9962
08:28:11,000 --> 08:28:15,580
Guys, 100 gifted guys.

9963
08:28:18,720 --> 08:28:18,980
No.

9964
08:28:23,100 --> 08:28:25,360
100 said she give you the...

9965
08:28:25,800 --> 08:28:26,160
Wait.

9966
08:28:27,060 --> 08:28:27,780
Chat.

9967
08:28:28,120 --> 08:28:29,900
Chat, can I have an IOU?

9968
08:28:30,180 --> 08:28:30,600
Chat?

9969
08:28:31,780 --> 08:28:33,280
Chat, can I have...

9970
08:28:33,280 --> 08:28:36,100
Can I have an IOU, guys?

9971
08:28:36,100 --> 08:28:38,440
Oh, it's Doki Bird.

9972
08:28:38,720 --> 08:28:40,400
Oh, fuck, okay.

9973
08:28:42,140 --> 08:28:44,080
Guys, can I have an...

9974
08:28:44,080 --> 08:28:45,420
You can spot me, right?

9975
08:28:47,480 --> 08:28:48,040
Fucking...

9976
08:28:48,040 --> 08:28:50,000
You can spot me, right, guys?

9977
08:28:50,460 --> 08:28:53,100
I just need like 200.

9978
08:28:55,580 --> 08:28:57,980
Just a little bit.

9979
08:28:58,140 --> 08:28:59,140
Can't be that much.

9980
08:29:01,340 --> 08:29:02,740
Can you guys spot me real quick?

9981
08:29:04,520 --> 08:29:05,320
Jesus Christ.

9982
08:29:05,820 --> 08:29:07,160
Wait, are we lagging?

9983
08:29:07,420 --> 08:29:07,620
Wait.

9984
08:29:08,560 --> 08:29:11,020
Oh, my God, wait, I'm fucking...

9985
08:29:12,000 --> 08:29:13,940
Everybody's like actually TPing a little bit for me.

9986
08:29:14,800 --> 08:29:16,480
Oh, my God, I was lagging a little bit.

9987
08:29:16,560 --> 08:29:17,160
That was crazy.

9988
08:29:20,080 --> 08:29:20,760
Wait, no!

9989
08:29:20,940 --> 08:29:21,580
Oh, my God!

9990
08:29:26,930 --> 08:29:28,270
Holy shit, that poor man.

9991
08:29:30,050 --> 08:29:31,230
That poor man.

9992
08:29:33,210 --> 08:29:33,630
Oh.

9993
08:29:34,610 --> 08:29:35,770
Oh, my God.

9994
08:29:36,190 --> 08:29:37,670
Oh, my God.

9995
08:29:38,330 --> 08:29:42,620
Oh, my God, what's happened?

9996
08:29:43,440 --> 08:29:44,280
What happened?

9997
08:29:46,120 --> 08:29:48,060
I'm TPing back, I'm TPing back, just live right now.

9998
08:29:48,720 --> 08:29:50,580
Holy shit, that was crazy.

9999
08:29:51,500 --> 08:29:53,860
Take TP, take TP, take TP, come, come, come.

10000
08:29:54,600 --> 08:29:55,160
Where's TP?

10001
08:29:56,420 --> 08:29:57,040
Take TP!

10002
08:29:57,680 --> 08:29:58,200
I'm here.

10003
08:30:01,240 --> 08:30:03,300
I don't think they're taking TP.

10004
08:30:07,520 --> 08:30:09,920
It's just me and you.

10005
08:30:12,440 --> 08:30:13,860
I'm scared.

10006
08:30:15,160 --> 08:30:17,120
Oh, holy fuck!

10007
08:30:18,180 --> 08:30:19,720
Holy fuck!

10008
08:30:21,810 --> 08:30:22,900
Oh, my God.

10009
08:30:24,720 --> 08:30:26,460
That's crazy.

10010
08:30:28,560 --> 08:30:30,120
Guys, I don't...

10011
08:30:30,120 --> 08:30:31,840
Yeah, that was...

10012
08:30:31,840 --> 08:30:32,620
That was pretty rough.

10013
08:30:34,460 --> 08:30:35,660
Where's my...

10014
08:30:35,660 --> 08:30:36,120
Okay.

10015
08:30:39,780 --> 08:30:41,420
Don't worry, Ironman.

10016
08:30:42,300 --> 08:30:43,460
We should have banned Hulk.

10017
08:30:44,000 --> 08:30:45,780
Who gives a fuck about our one trick?

10018
08:30:48,680 --> 08:30:50,020
We should have banned him.

10019
08:30:53,940 --> 08:30:56,000
Oh, my God, I'm scared.

10020
08:30:59,920 --> 08:31:02,260
Oh, my God, I'm so scared.

10021
08:31:02,260 --> 08:31:04,700
Oh, my God, we should fight this now.

10022
08:31:04,980 --> 08:31:07,920
We should 100% fight this.

10023
08:31:09,760 --> 08:31:12,140
Oh, he's fucking mad.

10024
08:31:13,040 --> 08:31:14,300
Oh, my God.

10025
08:31:16,400 --> 08:31:17,720
Oh, my God.

10026
08:31:19,380 --> 08:31:20,860
I don't know where that is.

10027
08:31:21,920 --> 08:31:22,620
I don't...

10028
08:31:25,140 --> 08:31:26,380
Oh, we got it.

10029
08:31:30,250 --> 08:31:32,010
Oh, my God, you're fine!

10030
08:31:32,010 --> 08:31:32,930
Oh, my God, you're so healthy!

10031
08:31:35,930 --> 08:31:37,750
They have over, you know.

10032
08:31:39,610 --> 08:31:40,690
Oh, my God!

10033
08:31:43,430 --> 08:31:45,130
That's a fucking lie!

10034
08:31:50,850 --> 08:31:55,290
Yeah, you think they can afford it?

10035
08:32:03,110 --> 08:32:10,770
Oh, my God, it feels like...

10036
08:32:10,770 --> 08:32:15,450
They have Wolverine on.

10037
08:32:17,010 --> 08:32:17,690
Oh, I need help.

10038
08:32:17,730 --> 08:32:18,410
I need help from Hulk.

10039
08:32:20,870 --> 08:32:21,570
Oh, Wolverine won.

10040
08:32:27,680 --> 08:32:30,060
Oh, my God!

10041
08:32:33,620 --> 08:32:34,340
Oh, my God!

10042
08:32:34,340 --> 08:32:35,460
I don't think you'll live.

10043
08:32:38,960 --> 08:32:39,560
You live.

10044
08:32:44,220 --> 08:32:46,700
Oh, my God, he actually...

10045
08:32:46,700 --> 08:32:47,880
Wait, Strangelove, Strangelove!

10046
08:32:52,600 --> 08:32:53,900
Oh, my God!

10047
08:33:01,960 --> 08:33:02,860
Oh, my God!

10048
08:33:03,260 --> 08:33:03,320
Oh, my God!

10049
08:33:03,320 --> 08:33:04,300
Wait, Wolverine's so low.

10050
08:33:04,400 --> 08:33:05,100
Wolverine's really low.

10051
08:33:07,680 --> 08:33:08,040
Okay.

10052
08:33:08,860 --> 08:33:10,200
Iron Man, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk.

10053
08:33:11,460 --> 08:33:12,400
Wait, there's someone behind us.

10054
08:33:12,540 --> 08:33:13,260
Man, this man is frozen.

10055
08:33:15,920 --> 08:33:16,880
That's fucking right!

10056
08:33:16,900 --> 08:33:17,920
I deserve to be in this ego!

10057
08:33:18,940 --> 08:33:20,980
That was the sickest freeze!

10058
08:33:24,500 --> 08:33:26,340
Okay, he got nothing off of that.

10059
08:33:26,440 --> 08:33:27,660
I think they have Hulk ult, right?

10060
08:33:36,400 --> 08:33:37,280
I have to reload.

10061
08:33:38,680 --> 08:33:39,840
There it is!

10062
08:33:42,240 --> 08:33:43,180
There it is!

10063
08:33:43,240 --> 08:33:44,120
Hulk is one, Hulk is one!

10064
08:33:49,210 --> 08:33:51,250
I deserve to be here!

10065
08:33:51,970 --> 08:33:53,510
I'm fucking insane!

10066
08:33:58,380 --> 08:33:59,960
Oh, my God, what did Mendoz say?

10067
08:34:00,000 --> 08:34:00,940
I was too busy winning.

10068
08:34:02,120 --> 08:34:03,700
I saw what he said.

10069
08:34:06,500 --> 08:34:08,680
3, 2, 1, now.

10070
08:34:10,920 --> 08:34:11,760
I'm jerky.

10071
08:34:11,980 --> 08:34:13,340
I saw what he said.

10072
08:34:15,180 --> 08:34:18,080
Bubbling 7, Bubbling 6, Bubbling 5.

10073
08:34:20,380 --> 08:34:21,080
Bubbling 7, Bubbling 6, Bubbling 5.

10074
08:34:21,080 --> 08:34:21,600
Bubble whenever you go in.

10075
08:34:22,280 --> 08:34:24,180
Bubble whenever you go in.

10076
08:34:24,400 --> 08:34:26,080
You should have Iron Man ult here.

10077
08:34:27,480 --> 08:34:28,240
Iron Man 1, Iron Man 1.

10078
08:34:28,940 --> 08:34:30,980
Bubbling 8, Bubbling 7, Bubbling 6.

10079
08:34:30,980 --> 08:34:31,380
Bubbling 8, Bubbling 7, Bubbling 6.

10080
08:34:32,240 --> 08:34:33,920
Kite that, kite that, kite, kite, kite.

10081
08:34:33,920 --> 08:34:36,540
I'm not using it, I'm not...

10082
08:34:38,920 --> 08:34:42,220
Oh, I have to use it then.

10083
08:34:42,960 --> 08:34:44,480
I'm here to save you, Ruben.

10084
08:34:45,900 --> 08:34:47,040
I'm ulting it on you.

10085
08:34:48,860 --> 08:34:50,180
You might die.

10086
08:34:52,500 --> 08:34:54,020
No ult, no ult, no ult, no ult.

10087
08:34:54,520 --> 08:34:56,800
Hulk dead, Hulk dead, Hulk dead.

10088
08:34:57,920 --> 08:34:58,720
Okay, bye yourself.

10089
08:34:58,720 --> 08:34:59,500
Oh!

10090
08:35:02,000 --> 08:35:02,400
Goodbye.

10091
08:35:07,240 --> 08:35:10,960
Wait, it's still winnable.

10092
08:35:16,640 --> 08:35:17,040
Nevermind.

10093
08:35:20,260 --> 08:35:21,040
Okay, you guys can get out.

10094
08:35:21,120 --> 08:35:21,700
We can heal you.

10095
08:35:27,490 --> 08:35:28,710
Oh my god, you lived.

10096
08:35:33,350 --> 08:35:34,670
They use Gamma, they use Gamma.

10097
08:35:34,710 --> 08:35:35,510
Just live, they use Gamma.

10098
08:35:42,650 --> 08:35:43,850
Oh my god.

10099
08:35:44,930 --> 08:35:46,290
You're so... Oh, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk.

10100
08:35:48,930 --> 08:35:49,630
Oh, Iron Man.

10101
08:35:49,810 --> 08:35:50,630
Strange low, strange low.

10102
08:35:53,850 --> 08:35:55,190
Hulk is half, Hulk is frozen.

10103
08:35:56,530 --> 08:35:57,350
Hulk is 1, Hulk is 1.

10104
08:36:01,630 --> 08:36:02,930
Baby Hulk, baby Hulk.

10105
08:36:05,970 --> 08:36:07,030
Raccoon?

10106
08:36:09,960 --> 08:36:10,630
Yay!

10107
08:36:15,950 --> 08:36:18,110
Okay, what do you say?

10108
08:36:19,170 --> 08:36:19,550
I'm...

10109
08:36:19,550 --> 08:36:24,130
Oh my god.

10110
08:36:25,090 --> 08:36:27,570
Oh my god.

10111
08:36:27,790 --> 08:36:29,810
Having fun.

10112
08:36:30,050 --> 08:36:30,710
I just...

10113
08:36:32,370 --> 08:36:33,470
You're so...

10114
08:36:39,010 --> 08:36:40,090
Oh my god.

10115
08:36:40,130 --> 08:36:41,490
Oh my god, bro is losing it.

10116
08:36:41,770 --> 08:36:43,110
Okay, you know what would tell someone?

10117
08:36:55,300 --> 08:36:57,240
Don't keep, please.

10118
08:36:59,900 --> 08:37:01,140
Oh my god.

10119
08:37:01,620 --> 08:37:05,120
Finally, the curse of Ra is not on me.

10120
08:37:05,120 --> 08:37:08,840
Everything is turning around for Doki.

10121
08:37:13,780 --> 08:37:14,780
That's fucked.

10122
08:37:19,420 --> 08:37:21,600
Everything is turning around.

10123
08:37:23,040 --> 08:37:24,140
For Doki.

10124
08:37:25,340 --> 08:37:26,480
I'm gonna jinx it, aren't I?

10125
08:37:26,620 --> 08:37:29,260
They're gonna fucking push it all the way and snowball us.

10126
08:37:29,320 --> 08:37:30,020
I can feel it.

10127
08:37:30,560 --> 08:37:33,300
The one time I feel happiness for myself.

10128
08:37:33,300 --> 08:37:36,020
The one time I feel good about myself.

10129
08:37:36,020 --> 08:37:37,120
It's gonna happen.

10130
08:37:38,460 --> 08:37:41,640
I can feel it.

10131
08:37:51,360 --> 08:37:52,060
Hulk's alright.

10132
08:37:55,300 --> 08:37:57,740
Oh my god, I can't help you there.

10133
08:38:03,300 --> 08:38:04,540
Okay, I don't feel good.

10134
08:38:09,980 --> 08:38:10,700
Oh, bro.

10135
08:38:11,040 --> 08:38:12,140
Yeah, you can't go too deep.

10136
08:38:13,880 --> 08:38:14,900
We can kite here.

10137
08:38:16,000 --> 08:38:16,800
Yeah, I'm kiting back.

10138
08:38:17,440 --> 08:38:19,100
There's a strange on us.

10139
08:38:19,220 --> 08:38:20,920
Wrap around, wrap around our main.

10140
08:38:21,580 --> 08:38:22,680
Yeah, we're here, we're here.

10141
08:38:24,180 --> 08:38:25,240
I'm going all the way back.

10142
08:38:25,400 --> 08:38:25,880
Main, main.

10143
08:38:27,400 --> 08:38:28,480
This way, this way, this way.

10144
08:38:31,420 --> 08:38:32,880
I don't know if I can touch this, bro.

10145
08:38:32,880 --> 08:38:34,140
Touch, touch, touch.

10146
08:38:35,640 --> 08:38:38,120
Oh, I got grabbed.

10147
08:38:38,500 --> 08:38:39,200
I need help behind.

10148
08:38:39,480 --> 08:38:40,540
I'm frozen, I'm frozen, I'm frozen.

10149
08:38:42,500 --> 08:38:43,740
Someone get the Hulk if you can.

10150
08:38:45,700 --> 08:38:47,120
Oh, no, it's behind us.

10151
08:38:47,220 --> 08:38:47,780
It was behind us.

10152
08:38:53,890 --> 08:38:54,710
Oh my god.

10153
08:38:55,630 --> 08:38:56,470
It's just the tings.

10154
08:39:05,300 --> 08:39:06,240
Yeah, there's Doki.

10155
08:39:06,380 --> 08:39:06,780
Get out of there.

10156
08:39:07,160 --> 08:39:08,540
Yeah, I'm going the other way.

10157
08:39:12,520 --> 08:39:16,000
It's fine, this point should be more open for our Iron Man to fight.

10158
08:39:17,520 --> 08:39:19,280
We can bubble you whenever you get him though.

10159
08:39:26,460 --> 08:39:27,300
Bubble, bubble, bubble.

10160
08:39:28,900 --> 08:39:30,700
Oh my god, he came out of nowhere.

10161
08:39:31,320 --> 08:39:31,880
I was excited.

10162
08:39:33,560 --> 08:39:34,280
Do you have bubble?

10163
08:39:35,600 --> 08:39:36,840
Yeah, no, I don't have bubble.

10164
08:39:37,780 --> 08:39:39,560
But I'm ulting, I'm ulting, you just watch.

10165
08:39:40,700 --> 08:39:41,720
Hulk is low, Hulk is low.

10166
08:39:42,000 --> 08:39:42,460
Hulk is out.

10167
08:39:45,600 --> 08:39:46,540
I can bubble you, Iron Man.

10168
08:39:49,120 --> 08:39:50,240
Focus change, focus change.

10169
08:39:50,340 --> 08:39:54,020
This is ridiculous high ground for Punisher.

10170
08:39:54,220 --> 08:39:54,860
Holy crud.

10171
08:39:54,960 --> 08:39:56,240
I have to reload, I can't heal you.

10172
08:40:02,020 --> 08:40:03,600
I need heals, I need heals.

10173
08:40:03,920 --> 08:40:04,300
Let me know.

10174
08:40:04,440 --> 08:40:05,300
Do you have gamma, do you have gamma?

10175
08:40:05,300 --> 08:40:06,080
I need heals.

10176
08:40:06,860 --> 08:40:08,400
Let him walk a bit.

10177
08:40:10,860 --> 08:40:12,160
Back, back, back, kite the Z, kite the Z.

10178
08:40:12,240 --> 08:40:12,940
Back, back, back, back.

10179
08:40:22,180 --> 08:40:23,240
I'm not ulting this.

10180
08:40:24,420 --> 08:40:25,080
Oh my god.

10181
08:40:26,260 --> 08:40:27,980
I'm bubbling 8, I'm bubbling 7.

10182
08:40:31,440 --> 08:40:33,460
Bubbling 3, bubbling 2.

10183
08:40:37,440 --> 08:40:38,020
We should push up.

10184
08:40:39,900 --> 08:40:41,340
Left side, left side, there's a rocket.

10185
08:40:41,840 --> 08:40:42,560
In the building.

10186
08:40:43,420 --> 08:40:44,300
In the heart, uh, strange.

10187
08:40:47,580 --> 08:40:48,960
I can't see you guys for heals.

10188
08:40:49,320 --> 08:40:50,440
He dies, he dies, he dies, he dies.

10189
08:40:52,000 --> 08:40:52,400
Nice.

10190
08:40:55,040 --> 08:40:57,760
Make sure I have Iron Man ult here and, uh, strange ult.

10191
08:41:00,520 --> 08:41:01,820
And Hulk ult too.

10192
08:41:09,760 --> 08:41:11,040
I'll make sure I...

10193
08:41:11,040 --> 08:41:12,280
Oh, he got exiled.

10194
08:41:23,380 --> 08:41:25,180
Oh my god, noob.

10195
08:41:27,900 --> 08:41:27,980
Nice.

10196
08:41:30,740 --> 08:41:31,680
Did I get anybody?

10197
08:41:32,040 --> 08:41:33,200
Oh, that's bad.

10198
08:41:33,440 --> 08:41:34,560
Don't worry, don't worry, it's gone.

10199
08:41:35,080 --> 08:41:35,920
I froze Hulk.

10200
08:41:43,330 --> 08:41:44,270
Behind you, behind you, behind you!

10201
08:41:45,510 --> 08:41:45,850
Ow.

10202
08:41:48,830 --> 08:41:51,190
I have to reload.

10203
08:41:51,290 --> 08:41:52,030
I can't heal you, Iron Man.

10204
08:41:55,470 --> 08:41:56,990
If I can't heal you, you're L.S.

10205
08:42:03,040 --> 08:42:04,420
I come back to punish for ult.

10206
08:42:05,420 --> 08:42:06,100
Do we need it?

10207
08:42:07,380 --> 08:42:08,620
Uh, no, not yet, not yet.

10208
08:42:10,060 --> 08:42:11,180
Iron Man, are you okay?

10209
08:42:11,700 --> 08:42:13,320
I'm gonna use gamma, I'm gonna use gamma.

10210
08:42:14,220 --> 08:42:14,720
Bubble, bubble.

10211
08:42:17,660 --> 08:42:19,080
I have to reload, can't heal you.

10212
08:42:20,140 --> 08:42:22,240
Bubble in seven, bubble in six.

10213
08:42:24,340 --> 08:42:25,940
Bubble in three, for you, Iron Man.

10214
08:42:26,040 --> 08:42:27,800
Two, one, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk.

10215
08:42:27,800 --> 08:42:28,400
I suck.

10216
08:42:33,900 --> 08:42:35,460
Oh, he fucking...

10217
08:42:36,160 --> 08:42:37,320
I can't heal you anymore.

10218
08:42:41,060 --> 08:42:41,900
I'm gonna ult this.

10219
08:42:44,300 --> 08:42:44,780
Stun.

10220
08:42:47,280 --> 08:42:48,340
Oh, nice.

10221
08:42:51,740 --> 08:42:53,180
Can we stagger him?

10222
08:42:53,280 --> 08:42:53,420
Yeah.

10223
08:42:54,000 --> 08:42:54,960
Yeah, stagger him.

10224
08:42:59,160 --> 08:43:00,860
What if he just kills you?

10225
08:43:02,700 --> 08:43:03,140
Nice.

10226
08:43:03,580 --> 08:43:04,260
Good stagger.

10227
08:43:07,320 --> 08:43:09,000
They have Iron Man ult here.

10228
08:43:09,660 --> 08:43:11,120
And Strange ult, but I don't have Nuke.

10229
08:43:11,400 --> 08:43:13,700
I'm gonna eat it with my ult.

10230
08:43:15,920 --> 08:43:17,980
Oh, Iron Man, Iron Man bought it, Iron Man bought it.

10231
08:43:21,240 --> 08:43:22,260
He's looking for it.

10232
08:43:25,750 --> 08:43:29,570
Iron Man is literally behind us right now.

10233
08:43:35,180 --> 08:43:36,800
I got exiled.

10234
08:43:43,100 --> 08:43:44,220
Keep me up, keep me up.

10235
08:43:44,700 --> 08:43:46,180
I'm gonna reload.

10236
08:43:51,040 --> 08:43:53,060
It's fine, we stalled for a long time.

10237
08:43:54,160 --> 08:43:55,060
I'm dying.

10238
08:43:58,480 --> 08:44:00,300
This play is really good for a bubble.

10239
08:44:00,940 --> 08:44:03,300
Oh my god, I messed my...

10240
08:44:03,300 --> 08:44:04,800
I messed my freezes there.

10241
08:44:06,220 --> 08:44:07,460
Oh my god.

10242
08:44:09,460 --> 08:44:11,100
I messed up my freezes.

10243
08:44:15,080 --> 08:44:16,780
I need to remember he bubbles...

10244
08:44:16,780 --> 08:44:18,420
Hulk bubbles in when he jumps in.

10245
08:44:23,050 --> 08:44:24,370
I need reload, I need reload.

10246
08:44:27,890 --> 08:44:29,190
Oh my god, he gets exiled.

10247
08:44:29,190 --> 08:44:30,710
They're all low, they're actually all low.

10248
08:44:32,650 --> 08:44:34,330
When he gets exiled, it's not cool.

10249
08:44:43,280 --> 08:44:45,460
This is how he gets rank 1, everybody!

10250
08:44:45,760 --> 08:44:48,080
This is how he does it, look at these comms!

10251
08:44:52,220 --> 08:44:53,740
Look at these comms!

10252
08:44:54,920 --> 08:44:55,900
I'm gonna kill Iron Man.

10253
08:44:56,720 --> 08:44:58,120
I can bubble you, I'm going to bubble you.

10254
08:44:58,620 --> 08:44:59,880
I don't see you for heals.

10255
08:44:59,880 --> 08:45:00,920
I got you.

10256
08:45:03,420 --> 08:45:04,480
I need reload.

10257
08:45:15,540 --> 08:45:18,590
I gotta make sure he misses.

10258
08:45:21,460 --> 08:45:25,340
Bubble in 6, bubble in 5, bubble in 4.

10259
08:45:25,840 --> 08:45:26,900
Hulk to our left.

10260
08:45:34,550 --> 08:45:36,770
Bubble in 6, bubble in 5.

10261
08:45:37,230 --> 08:45:40,370
Bubble in 2, bubble in 1, Iron Man.

10262
08:45:45,370 --> 08:45:46,770
I'm ulting this, I'm ulting this.

10263
08:45:52,970 --> 08:45:55,590
Oh my god, we're so heavy!

10264
08:45:57,370 --> 08:45:58,730
We're still so heavy!

10265
08:45:58,730 --> 08:45:58,870
We're so heavy!

10266
08:46:08,110 --> 08:46:09,630
Wait, they Hulk ulted, they Hulk ulted.

10267
08:46:10,250 --> 08:46:11,090
I'm backing up.

10268
08:46:13,650 --> 08:46:15,530
They're trying to portal us off, they're trying to portal us off.

10269
08:46:15,730 --> 08:46:16,910
I got exiled.

10270
08:46:19,330 --> 08:46:20,730
Get out of spawn, get out of spawn.

10271
08:46:23,110 --> 08:46:34,040
I got out.

10272
08:46:34,040 --> 08:46:35,640
I had to bubble myself.

10273
08:46:36,300 --> 08:46:37,240
Oh, I couldn't do anything.

10274
08:46:38,360 --> 08:46:39,300
I'm rezzed, I'm rezzed, I'm rezzed.

10275
08:46:45,750 --> 08:46:47,010
I'm trying to keep her.

10276
08:46:49,010 --> 08:46:50,030
I had to bubble myself again.

10277
08:46:56,400 --> 08:46:58,380
Oh my god, he bubbled it, of course he did.

10278
08:46:58,560 --> 08:46:59,260
I need to run very thick.

10279
08:47:00,160 --> 08:47:00,540
No!

10280
08:47:04,460 --> 08:47:05,680
That Hulk is good.

10281
08:47:07,400 --> 08:47:08,780
Oh my god.

10282
08:47:09,960 --> 08:47:12,220
Oh, this is an intense game.

10283
08:47:12,540 --> 08:47:14,640
This is an intense one.

10284
08:47:15,780 --> 08:47:17,640
This is an intense one.

10285
08:47:22,840 --> 08:47:24,400
This is why we ban Hulk.

10286
08:47:24,740 --> 08:47:25,600
I don't know.

10287
08:47:25,800 --> 08:47:30,860
I see you Hulk one trick, but I fucking hate playing against Hulk.

10288
08:47:34,040 --> 08:47:34,940
I didn't remember.

10289
08:47:35,420 --> 08:47:36,500
When he jumps in, he bubbles.

10290
08:47:36,500 --> 08:47:39,000
So, to dodge my freeze.

10291
08:47:43,430 --> 08:47:44,600
Fucking insane.

10292
08:47:47,380 --> 08:47:49,140
I think we have Mantis, maybe?

10293
08:47:50,340 --> 08:47:50,940
I don't know.

10294
08:47:52,660 --> 08:47:54,000
Oh my god.

10295
08:47:54,480 --> 08:47:55,640
I'm fucking gaming.

10296
08:47:56,980 --> 08:47:57,520
Yeah.

10297
08:47:58,260 --> 08:48:01,620
Yeah, now I'm actually...

10298
08:48:04,240 --> 08:48:06,900
Oh no, he's on the list.

10299
08:48:07,920 --> 08:48:09,860
He's on the list now, guys.

10300
08:48:20,140 --> 08:48:20,980
Oh no.

10301
08:48:22,780 --> 08:48:23,500
He's ready.

10302
08:48:24,080 --> 08:48:25,720
He's ready to put him on the fucking list.

10303
08:48:28,240 --> 08:48:29,420
We also have to ban...

10304
08:48:29,420 --> 08:48:30,220
Oh, I didn't get a chance.

10305
08:48:30,360 --> 08:48:31,820
I can't orb you there.

10306
08:48:43,120 --> 08:48:43,840
It's alright.

10307
08:48:44,660 --> 08:48:45,020
Yep.

10308
08:48:53,000 --> 08:48:53,960
Back, back, back, back.

10309
08:48:54,000 --> 08:48:54,580
Drop, drop, drop.

10310
08:48:54,760 --> 08:48:55,640
Back, back, back, back.

10311
08:48:59,620 --> 08:49:00,180
I reload.

10312
08:49:01,220 --> 08:49:02,120
Hulk is coming over.

10313
08:49:11,620 --> 08:49:12,940
I can bubble Iron Man now.

10314
08:49:14,560 --> 08:49:15,260
I reload.

10315
08:49:23,220 --> 08:49:23,880
Strange can die.

10316
08:49:28,480 --> 08:49:29,740
I reload here.

10317
08:49:33,220 --> 08:49:34,800
Oh, he took so much damage.

10318
08:49:39,000 --> 08:49:41,380
I have 91.

10319
08:49:47,540 --> 08:49:48,820
I can Luna ult this.

10320
08:49:49,680 --> 08:49:50,180
I'm Luna ulting.

10321
08:49:52,620 --> 08:49:53,780
I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it.

10322
08:49:59,280 --> 08:50:00,100
I'm keeping back.

10323
08:50:00,140 --> 08:50:01,460
Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk.

10324
08:50:02,300 --> 08:50:04,300
Cap point, cap point, cap point.

10325
08:50:05,080 --> 08:50:06,500
They can't touch, they can't touch point.

10326
08:50:08,220 --> 08:50:08,940
There's an Iron Man.

10327
08:50:09,360 --> 08:50:10,220
Oh my gosh.

10328
08:50:12,160 --> 08:50:12,840
I'm dead.

10329
08:50:13,500 --> 08:50:14,900
Oh, Strange is half.

10330
08:50:23,740 --> 08:50:24,540
Oh no.

10331
08:50:25,120 --> 08:50:25,540
Hulk half.

10332
08:50:39,310 --> 08:50:40,870
Oh, this is intense.

10333
08:50:47,410 --> 08:50:50,970
You're not allowed to play that on your ult.

10334
08:51:01,840 --> 08:51:03,580
Oh my god, I have to reload.

10335
08:51:12,290 --> 08:51:13,050
Change.

10336
08:51:13,630 --> 08:51:15,330
Change your rocket, change your rocket.

10337
08:51:19,640 --> 08:51:21,160
Oh my god.

10338
08:51:23,460 --> 08:51:24,900
Oh my god.

10339
08:51:30,680 --> 08:51:31,840
That's actually...

10340
08:51:31,840 --> 08:51:33,750
Oh my god, that's crazy.

10341
08:51:36,280 --> 08:51:37,300
It is winnable.

10342
08:51:38,220 --> 08:51:39,100
It is winnable.

10343
08:51:41,880 --> 08:51:44,920
Bro, hitting an Iron Man is so fucking stressful.

10344
08:51:47,100 --> 08:51:48,260
It's so...

10345
08:51:48,260 --> 08:51:52,800
Cause like, they're all high ELO players so their movement is so fucking hard to predict.

10346
08:51:53,780 --> 08:51:55,840
Cause they have to be like...

10347
08:51:55,840 --> 08:51:58,040
They have to have really fucking insane movement.

10348
08:51:58,420 --> 08:52:02,260
But as a support player it's so fucking tilting to heal that.

10349
08:52:02,540 --> 08:52:03,820
I literally like...

10350
08:52:03,820 --> 08:52:04,780
I was like...

10351
08:52:04,780 --> 08:52:10,240
I know you're trying not to die but oh my...

10352
08:52:11,300 --> 08:52:16,960
I know you're not trying to die but holy fuck your movement is too good.

10353
08:52:17,340 --> 08:52:20,720
And then I'm moving too cause I don't wanna die too.

10354
08:52:21,200 --> 08:52:25,000
Like, I don't wanna die so I have to move too.

10355
08:52:25,340 --> 08:52:29,540
So like, I have to do mega prediction on two good...

10356
08:52:29,540 --> 08:52:31,620
Double good movements.

10357
08:52:32,180 --> 08:52:32,860
Like...

10358
08:52:34,200 --> 08:52:35,560
Oh my god.

10359
08:52:38,160 --> 08:52:39,240
Oh my god.

10360
08:52:39,280 --> 08:52:40,400
It's actually...

10361
08:52:42,960 --> 08:52:44,320
Holy shit.

10362
08:52:44,780 --> 08:52:47,480
It's so stressful.

10363
08:52:47,480 --> 08:52:47,700
It's so stressful.

10364
08:52:49,860 --> 08:52:51,600
I'm just setting up A.

10365
08:52:52,360 --> 08:52:53,960
This is stressful as fuck.

10366
08:52:56,440 --> 08:52:57,520
Holy fuck.

10367
08:52:58,380 --> 08:52:59,380
Guys, I don't think we...

10368
08:52:59,380 --> 08:53:01,000
There's a possibility...

10369
08:53:02,400 --> 08:53:02,940
Okay.

10370
08:53:06,220 --> 08:53:07,680
I'm gonna go in with my shift.

10371
08:53:07,780 --> 08:53:08,380
I can't.

10372
08:53:12,980 --> 08:53:14,020
I froze somebody?

10373
08:53:18,780 --> 08:53:20,500
Oh my god.

10374
08:53:22,600 --> 08:53:23,500
Dude, they used...

10375
08:53:23,500 --> 08:53:24,420
Why didn't we use Z?

10376
08:53:24,800 --> 08:53:26,300
They used Z and we just lose?

10377
08:53:27,480 --> 08:53:30,200
Um, I got respawned so I might die.

10378
08:53:30,980 --> 08:53:32,560
Yeah, you just gotta die again.

10379
08:53:33,020 --> 08:53:34,640
We gotta make sure we use Z first.

10380
08:53:34,780 --> 08:53:35,500
Like, as soon as we...

10381
08:53:36,040 --> 08:53:36,440
Z.

10382
08:53:39,200 --> 08:53:40,620
Oh, they got staggered.

10383
08:53:43,860 --> 08:53:45,360
Oh my god, guys.

10384
08:53:45,600 --> 08:53:47,340
That was a great game, guys.

10385
08:53:51,580 --> 08:53:53,260
It do be like that.

10386
08:53:54,580 --> 08:53:55,360
This is rough.

10387
08:53:55,580 --> 08:53:56,340
This is actually rough.

10388
08:54:13,120 --> 08:54:13,880
I have to reload.

10389
08:54:15,860 --> 08:54:16,660
Maximum pulse!

10390
08:54:17,960 --> 08:54:18,340
Nice.

10391
08:54:20,840 --> 08:54:21,440
Strange is low!

10392
08:54:21,540 --> 08:54:22,260
Strange is so low!

10393
08:54:23,260 --> 08:54:24,160
Got him, got him, got him.

10394
08:54:27,490 --> 08:54:28,610
I'm gonna save my Reynald.

10395
08:54:30,930 --> 08:54:31,970
Well, Ironman, Ironman.

10396
08:54:32,010 --> 08:54:32,810
Shoot Ironman, shoot Ironman.

10397
08:54:34,130 --> 08:54:35,250
I have to...

10398
08:54:35,850 --> 08:54:36,330
back up.

10399
08:54:38,350 --> 08:54:39,090
He was on your right.

10400
08:54:39,110 --> 08:54:39,770
He was on your right window.

10401
08:54:40,510 --> 08:54:40,990
Back to you.

10402
08:54:46,090 --> 08:54:46,490
Reload.

10403
08:54:47,830 --> 08:54:48,690
Go point, go point.

10404
08:54:48,750 --> 08:54:49,250
We have to go point.

10405
08:54:53,680 --> 08:54:56,340
I have Luna ult, but they have all their ults.

10406
08:54:56,480 --> 08:54:57,300
They saved everything.

10407
08:54:57,540 --> 08:54:58,620
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

10408
08:55:00,460 --> 08:55:01,740
I'm backing up a little bit.

10409
08:55:10,860 --> 08:55:12,220
There's a Hulk behind you guys.

10410
08:55:13,880 --> 08:55:14,780
Can we cut this?

10411
08:55:15,280 --> 08:55:16,440
Oh yeah, I have the ult.

10412
08:55:24,010 --> 08:55:25,630
There's a Hulk beating us behind.

10413
08:55:26,450 --> 08:55:27,890
That's huge, that's huge, that's huge, Hulk.

10414
08:55:28,110 --> 08:55:28,670
I'm backing up.

10415
08:55:30,830 --> 08:55:32,930
Oh, I couldn't get it.

10416
08:55:39,130 --> 08:55:39,690
No!

10417
08:55:48,100 --> 08:55:50,860
I almost got the freeze too!

10418
08:55:51,520 --> 08:55:53,320
That was a really good game though.

10419
08:55:54,980 --> 08:55:55,740
Oh my god.

10420
08:55:55,900 --> 08:55:57,660
That was a really good game.

10421
08:55:58,600 --> 08:55:59,160
Oh.

10422
08:55:59,860 --> 08:56:04,260
Guys, if I lose the next one, I'm out of eternity.

10423
08:56:04,500 --> 08:56:05,140
I can't.

10424
08:56:05,260 --> 08:56:07,140
We'll go again next time.

10425
08:56:07,460 --> 08:56:10,520
That was a really good game though.

10426
08:56:12,540 --> 08:56:13,760
Exclamation point, Luna.

10427
08:56:13,840 --> 08:56:14,940
Why I don't use the tech.

10428
08:56:15,600 --> 08:56:16,440
Oh my god.

10429
08:56:17,440 --> 08:56:18,760
See, I'm still there.

10430
08:56:18,900 --> 08:56:19,540
Let's go.

10431
08:56:19,780 --> 08:56:20,280
I just gotta wait.

10432
08:56:21,920 --> 08:56:24,280
It's bitch time, it's bitch time.

10433
08:56:24,420 --> 08:56:26,540
I like that game though.

10434
08:56:26,540 --> 08:56:28,560
That game was insane.

10435
08:56:28,740 --> 08:56:31,720
That was an insane game that we had.

10436
08:56:32,480 --> 08:56:36,340
Oh my, I had fun.

10437
08:56:36,880 --> 08:56:38,520
Okay, 10 more games.

10438
08:56:39,140 --> 08:56:41,400
You got like 4 hours.

10439
08:56:42,700 --> 08:56:43,700
Tomorrow.

10440
08:56:44,420 --> 08:56:44,900
Maybe.

10441
08:56:45,720 --> 08:56:48,500
Or later today.

10442
08:56:49,040 --> 08:56:49,560
Maybe.

10443
08:56:52,680 --> 08:56:54,680
I bitched.

10444
08:56:59,740 --> 08:57:00,180
Alright.

10445
08:57:02,240 --> 08:57:02,680
Alright.

10446
08:57:03,640 --> 08:57:03,680
Alright.

10447
08:57:03,680 --> 08:57:06,580
Mendo gets his carry back.

10448
08:57:09,680 --> 08:57:10,820
Oh my god.

10449
08:57:11,280 --> 08:57:11,820
That was good.

10450
08:57:11,940 --> 08:57:12,920
That was a good game.

10451
08:57:13,020 --> 08:57:14,280
I think I did really well.

10452
08:57:14,540 --> 08:57:21,340
I think like, if I did that freeze on the strange, I think we would've clutched it.

10453
08:57:21,440 --> 08:57:24,360
But like, that shit was like, I did so many freezes already.

10454
08:57:24,360 --> 08:57:25,600
I'm fucking...

10455
08:57:27,120 --> 08:57:32,540
Just one less freeze like, you know, really changes the game.

10456
08:57:33,080 --> 08:57:38,200
But yeah, for those who are wondering why I don't do the scroll wheel tech it's because it's bugged right now.

10457
08:57:38,520 --> 08:57:42,240
The fact that you can do the scroll wheel tech and it can stay on damage.

10458
08:57:42,420 --> 08:57:47,320
It'll stay heal, it stays heal on your screen, but it'll stay, it'll be on damage.

10459
08:57:47,640 --> 08:57:49,400
Like, in the game it'll be on damage.

10460
08:57:49,480 --> 08:57:54,040
And I don't do that because like I did it this morning, I did it yesterday Oh my god, this morning.

10461
08:57:54,200 --> 08:57:54,940
Right now it's this morning.

10462
08:57:55,160 --> 08:58:02,380
I did it yesterday and um, and I got, I I lost the game because of it.

10463
08:58:02,440 --> 08:58:06,060
Because uh, it stayed on damage even though on my screen it says heal.

10464
08:58:06,240 --> 08:58:07,340
And it happened twice.

10465
08:58:07,760 --> 08:58:11,300
So, uh so like, I don't do it because it's too risky.

10466
08:58:11,800 --> 08:58:13,380
I manually press Q.

10467
08:58:13,640 --> 08:58:14,660
Um, I don't do scroll wheel.

10468
08:58:15,060 --> 08:58:16,760
Uh, but I don't spam it too.

10469
08:58:16,860 --> 08:58:18,540
If I spam it, it triggers it.

10470
08:58:18,740 --> 08:58:20,400
It's something to do with spamming it, basically.

10471
08:58:20,500 --> 08:58:23,460
If you spam the Q too much, basically it'll stay on damage.

10472
08:58:23,760 --> 08:58:24,600
So I just press Q.

10473
08:58:25,340 --> 08:58:26,500
Um, but yes, thank you everybody!

10474
08:58:26,700 --> 08:58:29,660
Huge shout out to Mace, Ruben, Mendo for letting me poach him.

10475
08:58:30,100 --> 08:58:32,940
Uh, we did it!

10476
08:58:33,140 --> 08:58:33,540
Yeah!

10477
08:58:35,340 --> 08:58:37,360
It was great meeting the rank 1 guy.

10478
08:58:37,820 --> 08:58:39,200
I can't believe I didn't know who he was.

10479
08:58:39,300 --> 08:58:40,560
I was just like, who the fuck is Mace?

10480
08:58:40,620 --> 08:58:43,220
And then like, you guys have to tell me he's rank 1.

10481
08:58:43,560 --> 08:58:45,640
Um, I still don't know how he sneaked right in.

10482
08:58:46,020 --> 08:58:48,780
Uh, yes, nice to meet you Mace!

10483
08:58:48,780 --> 08:58:50,860
Go again another time!

10484
08:58:51,000 --> 08:58:52,360
I had a great time playing with you.

10485
08:58:52,840 --> 08:58:54,820
Um, I didn't know.

10486
08:58:54,900 --> 08:58:56,160
I don't keep track of the date.

10487
08:58:56,720 --> 08:58:58,240
I can't believe he was Mace to the face.

10488
08:58:58,840 --> 08:59:03,080
Like, I avoided... I know I definitely avoided a Brig 1 trick called Mace to the face before.

10489
08:59:04,560 --> 08:59:05,040
I...

10490
08:59:05,040 --> 08:59:12,140
LOL LOL Mace, you can't lie!

10491
08:59:12,500 --> 08:59:19,400
You must have got avoided by so many people as a Brig 1 trick in Overwatch 2.

10492
08:59:19,680 --> 08:59:23,480
Who the fuck means...

10493
08:59:25,740 --> 08:59:27,240
We had no friends!

10494
08:59:27,580 --> 08:59:33,420
Literally, the moment we loaded in, the moment we... Oh my god, did you get paid off?

10495
08:59:33,640 --> 08:59:35,180
You must have got paid off didn't you?

10496
08:59:35,560 --> 08:59:36,900
Guys, guys, no gifted.

10497
08:59:41,580 --> 08:59:43,420
Just like, excuse me.

10498
08:59:46,660 --> 08:59:47,120
Oh my god.

10499
08:59:47,380 --> 08:59:48,240
Oh my god, look at this.

10500
08:59:48,820 --> 08:59:49,780
Is this the real?

10501
08:59:49,980 --> 08:59:51,280
Wait, wow, Mr. Mace?

10502
08:59:51,600 --> 08:59:52,500
No friends.

10503
08:59:52,740 --> 08:59:53,760
Sign my chest.

10504
08:59:54,160 --> 08:59:55,140
Do you have a marker?

10505
08:59:55,460 --> 08:59:56,300
At Mace.

10506
08:59:56,700 --> 08:59:58,260
And then, this is my...

10507
08:59:58,260 --> 08:59:59,900
Mace got that, that's why.

10508
09:00:00,040 --> 09:00:00,820
Woah, woah, woah.

10509
09:00:01,260 --> 09:00:03,360
Donkey Bird said she gave me 200 gifted.

10510
09:00:03,700 --> 09:00:05,220
Who's Donkey Bird?

10511
09:00:05,740 --> 09:00:10,640
LOL If anybody, I'm the one with no friends.

10512
09:00:10,780 --> 09:00:12,500
I literally got...

10513
09:00:12,500 --> 09:00:14,280
Who's Donkey Bird?

10514
09:00:14,280 --> 09:00:15,200
Right here.

10515
09:00:16,320 --> 09:00:24,520
LOL It's not like my stream was on the second or third.

10516
09:00:24,860 --> 09:00:29,340
It's not like my stream was top 3 of all my rivals, but who the fuck is Donkey Bird?

10517
09:00:30,340 --> 09:00:35,380
LOL I got humbled real quick.

10518
09:00:35,580 --> 09:00:37,420
I got humbled.

10519
09:00:37,780 --> 09:00:39,140
Ego check there.

10520
09:00:39,420 --> 09:00:41,000
Hey guys, I'm gonna head to bed.

10521
09:00:41,000 --> 09:00:48,000
I don't know if I'm gonna go again today or later today, but thank you everybody for coming.

10522
09:00:48,120 --> 09:00:49,940
For those who are new here, my name is Donkey Bird.

10523
09:00:50,020 --> 09:00:51,080
Please check me out on YouTube.

10524
09:00:51,260 --> 09:00:53,400
I usually stream over there for my schedule streams.

10525
09:00:53,740 --> 09:00:56,280
I do guerrilla streams on Twitch, so please follow me on Twitter.

10526
09:00:56,720 --> 09:01:07,400
If you wanna like, if you wanna know when I'm streaming on Twitch, which is basically like, you know, like I said, it's basically whenever I...

10527
09:01:07,400 --> 09:01:08,520
Who's messaging?

10528
09:01:08,520 --> 09:01:09,820
Okay, so we're running out of fuel.

10529
09:01:09,840 --> 09:01:12,060
I said I got plenty of fuel in the tank.

10530
09:01:12,160 --> 09:01:13,280
We can't iron on the loss.

10531
09:01:13,420 --> 09:01:14,360
Goodbye, Ruben.

10532
09:01:15,140 --> 09:01:15,800
I'm sorry.

10533
09:01:16,220 --> 09:01:18,100
I ran out of fuel.

10534
09:01:18,380 --> 09:01:19,380
Mace isn't even here.

10535
09:01:19,580 --> 09:01:20,140
I'm sorry.

10536
09:01:20,980 --> 09:01:21,380
LOL

10537
09:01:27,900 --> 09:01:32,440
I was gonna say, oh yes, if you wanna support me via other means, I have merch!

10538
09:01:33,280 --> 09:01:35,100
So I have a couple of different merch.

10539
09:01:35,160 --> 09:01:35,800
I have a custom PC.

10540
09:01:35,800 --> 09:01:43,580
See, I think the custom PC case has been sold out and keycaps, but we still have the wall scroll, the mouse pad, the desk mat, and the charm that's still being sold.

10541
09:01:43,880 --> 09:01:45,040
And then we have the gamer subcode.

10542
09:01:45,340 --> 09:01:48,000
And also, for those who are like, who the fuck is JokeyBread?

10543
09:01:49,680 --> 09:01:51,200
I have a Nendoroid.

10544
09:01:51,640 --> 09:01:57,820
LOL I mean, I have...

10545
09:01:58,560 --> 09:02:04,860
I have a Nendoroid that is like up for pre-order.

10546
09:02:05,340 --> 09:02:06,460
And that's me.

10547
09:02:06,580 --> 09:02:07,980
That's retro version me.

10548
09:02:08,320 --> 09:02:10,040
So like, I have different...

10549
09:02:10,040 --> 09:02:13,760
What if I just raid Mace's empty... LOL That's so fucked.

10550
09:02:14,020 --> 09:02:14,880
I'll raid Reaven.

10551
09:02:15,120 --> 09:02:22,300
I'll be like, what if I just raid like Mace's empty... LOL Like no stream.

10552
09:02:22,520 --> 09:02:23,740
That's so fucked.

10553
09:02:24,660 --> 09:02:25,340
LOL

10554
09:02:29,420 --> 09:02:32,440
But anyway, I have a Nendoroid.

10555
09:02:32,520 --> 09:02:35,260
If you do !Nendoroid, you can pre-order my own Nendoroid.

10556
09:02:35,440 --> 09:02:42,660
And if I get enough pre-orders for this one, there's a potential for a Nendoroid for my new skin suit, which is the one you see right now.

10557
09:02:43,460 --> 09:02:44,060
So yeah.

10558
09:02:45,220 --> 09:02:46,140
Ruben abuse.

10559
09:02:46,480 --> 09:02:46,800
Hey!

10560
09:02:46,900 --> 09:02:47,180
Hey!

10561
09:02:47,360 --> 09:02:47,580
Hey!

10562
09:02:47,720 --> 09:02:50,000
I chose a gamer over gamers.

10563
09:02:50,580 --> 09:02:54,180
And then Mace was like, these guys look like they're having fun.

10564
09:02:54,440 --> 09:02:56,680
I'm tired of the one tricks that Mendo's getting.

10565
09:02:57,080 --> 09:02:58,100
These guys look like...

10566
09:02:58,100 --> 09:02:58,860
LOL

10567
09:03:02,000 --> 09:03:09,040
Oh yeah, Mace, I don't know if you saw this, but Mendo's not having a good time ever since you left.

10568
09:03:10,840 --> 09:03:13,060
He's not having a great time.

10569
09:03:13,880 --> 09:03:17,040
He was the good luck charm that you needed.

10570
09:03:17,660 --> 09:03:22,300
LOL Bro, it's all your fault.

10571
09:03:22,860 --> 09:03:26,300
I have another scroll, one chicken, and I have this.

10572
09:03:26,500 --> 09:03:28,720
I got him like 8 wins!

10573
09:03:29,900 --> 09:03:31,260
How many wins did I got?

10574
09:03:32,060 --> 09:03:37,120
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8.

10575
09:03:37,280 --> 09:03:38,920
Oh, I got 8 wins too!

10576
09:03:39,500 --> 09:03:40,240
Look at that.

10577
09:03:41,680 --> 09:03:42,980
We're both equal.

10578
09:03:43,620 --> 09:03:47,140
LOL I got 8 wins as well.

10579
09:03:47,560 --> 09:03:48,000
Yippee!

10580
09:03:48,620 --> 09:03:51,960

I mean, it's pretty cute.

09:03:53,920 --> 09:03:56,200
It's pretty fucking cute, not gonna lie.

10583
09:03:57,920 --> 09:03:59,300
Is that everything I have to show?

10584

That's everything, right?

As always, everyone, stay hydrated, posture checked, and move around to get that blood flowing.

09:04:07,320 --> 09:04:09,900
And if you stay up for me, head to bed, guys.

You deserve it.
