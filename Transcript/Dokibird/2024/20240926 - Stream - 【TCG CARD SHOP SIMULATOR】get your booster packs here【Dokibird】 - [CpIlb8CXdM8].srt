1
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,620
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
Okay, sorry.

3
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,220
I'm waiting for the coffee to kick in.

4
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,240
I just chugged down some coffee.

5
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,660
I'm waiting for it to kick in.

6
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,840
Oh my god.

7
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,560
Today's gonna be...

8
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,260
a very long day.

9
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,760
Because after...

10
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,520
after... after the stream...

11
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,620
I gotta go to the bank and be an adult.

12
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,060
I didn't have to walk to the supermarket today.

13
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,700
Why can't the bank be closed?

14
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,860
You know, okay.

15
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,140
Not gonna lie.

16
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,580
If the bank was at least 10 minutes closer...

17
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,060
I wouldn't complain.

18
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,940
I wouldn't complain.

19
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,700
If the bank was at least 10 minutes closer.

20
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,600
And then you guys are like, yeah, but if you drive...

21
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,620
if you drive, Doki...

22
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,960
then it would be 10 minutes closer.

23
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,520
No, guys.

24
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,680
I can't.

25
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,160
I can't.

26
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,760
I'm like already like super...

27
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,120
I'm already an incredibly anxious person.

28
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,300
And you... you saw me drive in video games.

29
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,720
You saw how angry I can get in video games when I'm driving.

30
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,760
Like, I don't... I don't wanna unleash that in the world.

31
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,900
I don't... I don't wanna...

32
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:31,220
I don't wanna unleash that into the world.

33
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,760
So, I haven't licensed.

34
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,140
I just haven't drove in a very long time.

35
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,580
I just... I wish the bank was 10 minutes closer.

36
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,500
Like, I don't mind dealing with bank stuff.

37
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,320
I just... I just wish it was 10 minutes closer.

38
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,040
Like, walking all the way there is just the problem.

39
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,720
It's just so far.

40
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,260
It's so fucking far.

41
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,540
You can't know.

42
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,980
No, I have to...

43
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,200
I have to figure out what the fuck is my routing and transit number.

44
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,300
And, like, I need to get...

45
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:11,880
Like, I need to...

46
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,140
Apparently, I need to change my address on my account, too.

47
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:15,820
And everything.

48
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,260
And the lady was like, Yeah, you gotta...

49
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,100
You gotta...

50
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,960
You gotta, like, uh...

51
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,200
Go to your branch to do all that.

52
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,140
Uh, driving makes me anxious, too.

53
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,900
I feel you.

54
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,140
Maybe it's worth the Uber.

55
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,320
It's...

56
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,240
It's not worth the Uber.

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,980
Thank you for the super chat.

58
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,380
Thank you.

59
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:35,920
It's...

60
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,500
I already spent too much on Uber Eats.

61
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,240
Uber doesn't need more of my money.

62
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:40,640
Like...

63
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,460
It doesn't...

64
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,720
I'm just like...

65
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,720
I just like...

66
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,000
They already have, like, majority of my income via Uber Eats.

67
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,120
Like, they don't need more.

68
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,720
They don't need...

69
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,640
No bicycle.

70
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,860
I'm, like, actually really scared of riding a bike, um...

71
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,460
On the road.

72
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,840
Um...

73
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,340
I...

74
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,000
You are rich.

75
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,260
Why not Uber?

76
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,080
You see, there's things called taxes.

77
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,880
There's things called tax breaks.

78
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,200
You know what?

79
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,280
You see, I...

80
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:12,780
You see, I live in a...

81
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,920
I live in a country where, um, health care is considered free.

82
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,840
And...

83
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,360
But...

84
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,880
Do you know what pays for that health care?

85
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,840
And...

86
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,700
So...

87
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,460
.

88
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,160
People...

89
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,420
Me...

90
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,580
.

91
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,320
So...

92
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,480
I gotta get injured to my day off.

93
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,080
To capitalize on the... on the free health care.

94
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,780
Anyway, yeah.

95
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,340
So today's gonna be an incredibly long day for me.

96
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,120
Is she okay?

97
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,780
No, it's cup being adult.

98
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,120
You know, like, okay, you're not adult yet.

99
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,280
If you're like a teenager or a tween, but that's it.

100
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,060
That's... that's all the ages.

101
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,280
Because if you're under 13, you're not supposed to be watching me.

102
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:19,240
If you're a tween and teenager, and you're not an adult yet, and you think adults have it together, we do not.

103
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,800
We pretend we have it together, but we're all fucking liars.

104
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,260
Even your parents are liars.

105
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,100
They don't know what they're fucking doing.

106
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,420
Yeah, I'm PG-13.

107
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,380
They don't know what they're fucking doing.

108
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,880
They're just experimenting.

109
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,060
You're like their... their science experiment.

110
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,320
They're guinea pig.

111
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,920
You think they have it together?

112
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,340
They don't.

113
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,720
Anyway.

114
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,580
I'm just more transparent than the other adults.

115
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,200
Stop giving away the secrets, Doki.

116
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,720
They're supposed to respect us.

117
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,520
Alright, kids today, they don't fucking respect shit.

118
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,960
Don't lie to yourself.

119
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,380
Maybe 20 years ago, they would respect adults.

120
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,380
But that's a lie now.

121
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,460
They don't respect adults anymore.

122
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,940
So why should I respect them?

123
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:15,660
Why?

124
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,160
Make it till you make it.

125
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:27,340
It's cause 20 years ago, kids didn't really have the internet.

126
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,700
To like know what the fuck is going on in the world.

127
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,220
Now kids do, and now they don't respect us.

128
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,240
It's not...

129
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,200
I felt like I was lied to.

130
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:46,860
I thought when I was an adult, I'd be respected just like how I respected adults when I was a kid.

131
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:52,040
And now all these kids know about the internet and think they're better than me.

132
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,080
Well, you're right.

133
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,120
I'm an anime girl on the internet.

134
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,120
You're fucking right.

135
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,820
This is so goddamn true.

136
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,020
Anyway.

137
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,240
Snooks, thank you for the super chat.

138
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:05,740
Thank you.

139
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,440
Thank you.

140
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,360
This is so real, Doki.

141
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:12,560
I've lived in one place for two years and I'm still scared of calling my landlord.

142
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,980
Thank you for the super chat.

143
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:15,580
Thank you.

144
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,120
Thank you, Snooks.

145
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,380
Doki, please keep it together.

146
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,040
And please, we need them to start respecting us again.

147
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,820
Johnny, look on.

148
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,820
Thank you for the 10 gifted shows.

149
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,460
Thank you.

150
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,160
Thank you.

151
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,120
Doki's yelling at the clowns moment.

152
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,220
Anyway.

153
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,420
I'm having a midlife crisis right now.

154
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,820
So I'm going to start a card shop.

155
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,840
I heard this game is like incredibly addicting.

156
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,580
But I didn't really got...

157
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,780
I didn't get addicted to supermarket simulators.

158
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,580
So like...

159
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,480
I think it's also addicting for those who like to open card packs, I guess.

160
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,180
So luckily, I'm not cursed with that.

161
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,780
Okay, disabled controller.

162
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,060
If I disable controller, does that mean I'll go back to...

163
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:01,600
Okay, there we go.

164
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,000
What the fuck?

165
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,220
What is the sensitivity?

166
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,680
All right.

167
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,260
Okay.

168
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,400
So this is basically for those who don't know.

169
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:16,040
For those who don't know what TCG simulator, chart shop simulator is.

170
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,260
It's basically a card shop simulator.

171
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,160
It's like a supermarket simulator, but for cards.

172
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,600
Like literally the same thing.

173
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,900
I quit my day job to open my own card game shop.

174
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,480
This is it.

175
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,500
Time to get down to...

176
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,300
Oh, this is...

177
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,640
Oh, this is not 2010, boy.

178
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,340
Like comic book stores.

179
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,940
Are closing right now.

180
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,240
I don't think opening a TC...

181
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,740
Not a scam.

182
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,020
Not rigged.

183
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,400
Not rigged.

184
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,580
100%.

185
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,380
There we go.

186
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,120
It's not...

187
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,300
It's not a great idea, but like that's what midlife crisis are for.

188
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,960
Open phone and stock up on cards.

189
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,440
Okay.

190
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,380
I trust it.

191
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,920
It's a little bit of bad timing.

192
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,720
Not gonna lie.

193
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,240
Open stock up on card packs.

194
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:09,720
Okay.

195
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,460
Stock order.

196
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,300
Oh, shit.

197
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,660
The newest Terramon dual master.

198
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,420
Oh, my God.

199
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,480
Only 56.96 cents.

200
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,540
What the fuck is the .96?

201
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:21,800
Okay.

202
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,200
We'll buy one pack.

203
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,580
For now.

204
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,400
We'll just...

205
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,520
We'll just buy one pack.

206
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,260
How much money do I have?

207
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,300
Anyway.

208
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,340
I have $938.

209
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,620
That's my entire savings right there.

210
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:33,700
Okay.

211
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,720
That's...

212
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,540
It's not great, but like...

213
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,160
It's...

214
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,180
It's not the best, but like that's okay.

215
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,180
Okay.

216
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,340
Open box.

217
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,240
How do I place it?

218
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:46,680
Okay.

219
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,440
Oh.

220
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,240
Nope.

221
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,220
How do I place this?

222
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:50,540
Oh.

223
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,100
Hold item.

224
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:51,800
Okay.

225
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,040
All right, guys.

226
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,200
Here it is.

227
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,120
My entire savings right here.

228
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,420
All right.

229
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,180
Let's see.

230
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,620
How much should I price that?

231
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,320
It is $1.

232
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:12,480
Guys, I'm going to sell it for $3 because every pack in there is a guarantee holo.

233
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,420
Let customers know.

234
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:14,960
All right.

235
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,380
We're open.

236
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,440
It's not rigged.

237
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,040
So, you'll know every cart in there is a guarantee holo right here.

238
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,560
Oh, yes.

239
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:23,900
See?

240
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,440
He knows.

241
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,760
He knows.

242
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,140
Oh, my God.

243
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,540
Look at how many packs he bought.

244
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,600
Oh, my God.

245
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:32,680
Oh, my God.

246
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,960
Oh, market price is $3 higher?

247
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,720
What the fuck do you mean?

248
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,600
Oh, no.

249
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,160
Okay.

250
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:38,700
Wait, wait, wait.

251
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,120
0.05.

252
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,820
There we go.

253
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,200
There you go.

254
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:45,380
Okay.

255
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:45,880
No one...

256
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,640
Guys, I think I almost got scammed.

257
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,620
Guys, I...

258
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,640
I think I almost...

259
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,560
Oh, thank God.

260
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,260
Oh, no.

261
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,920
How do I...

262
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,500
Okay.

263
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:58,720
Done.

264
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,440
I almost got scammed.

265
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,740
Oh, my God.

266
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,580
Oh, my God.

267
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,760
No wonder they bought so much.

268
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,560
I was like, whoa!

269
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,260
They bought...

270
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,240
I almost scammed myself.

271
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,340
Okay.

272
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,320
Nice.

273
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,300
Okay.

274
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,000
That's okay.

275
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,580
We're fine.

276
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,040
Everything is fine.

277
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,340
I almost scammed myself, but I didn't.

278
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,720
There we go.

279
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,600
Okay.

280
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:26,840
See?

281
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,160
We're making money.

282
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:28,960
You know what?

283
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,840
Okay.

284
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,700
Since every pack is a guaranteed holo, I might as well...

285
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,420
No.

286
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,360
Maybe like...

287
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:36,640
Okay.

288
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,220
Maybe...

289
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:37,800
You know...

290
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,320
Every pack is a guaranteed holo.

291
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,620
So, like, you know...

292
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,120
Okay.

293
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:42,600
So, anyway.

294
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,340
Some people were asking...

295
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,940
Some people were asking about the weighing thing.

296
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,800
So, there was...

297
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,360
There are people...

298
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,020
Apparently, you can still do it, but some Pokemon cards...

299
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,740
I think, like, Pokemon card holos are heavier.

300
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,120
God!

301
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,920
So expensive!

302
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,020
Every pack is a...

303
00:12:59,020 --> 00:12:59,720
You cannot...

304
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,220
You cannot complain!

305
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,300
You cannot complain!

306
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,600
What if you get a holo?

307
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,380
What?

308
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,220
Oh, it's so expensive, yet you bought fucking five!

309
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,820
You bought five of them!

310
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,020
That's right.

311
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,320
All you do is complain.

312
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,480
That's right.

313
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,860
Give me my fucking money.

314
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,100
Anyway...

315
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,660
He's addicted.

316
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,340
He can't help it.

317
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,200
That's fucking right.

318
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,180
You'll always come back.

319
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,740
Okay.

320
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,540
Okay.

321
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:29,820
Okay.

322
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,300
I got card.

323
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,120
I got card and open them.

324
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,700
Oh, I can just open my own cards?

325
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,000
Wait!

326
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,560
Really?

327
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,960
Oh, my God.

328
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,880
Okay, there's Nimbus.

329
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,600
Negate 50%.

330
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,100
There's Tetron.

331
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,760
There's Chiron.

332
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,500
There's Clawop.

333
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,600
Guaranteed holo.

334
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,320
What can I say?

335
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,500
Guarant...

336
00:13:59,500 --> 00:13:59,700
I...

337
00:13:59,700 --> 00:13:59,800
I...

338
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,700
Not rigged.

339
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,140
One.

340
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,040
I told you.

341
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,160
Not rigged.

342
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,940
None of you believe me.

343
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,760
I told you.

344
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:18,740
I told you my packs have guaranteed hollows.

345
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,980
I'm blocking the card prices.

346
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,660
Don't worry, I'll tell you the card price.

347
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,920
I'll take a hundred packs right now.

348
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,780
I told you guys.

349
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,060
You didn't believe me.

350
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,440
No, I'll do it again.

351
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,860
All right.

352
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,820
Watch this.

353
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,340
Okay.

354
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,610
Stop.

355
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:49,850
What can I say?

356
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,750
Another guaranteed hollow.

357
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,990
Right there.

358
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,170
What can I say?

359
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,910
It's just that easy.

360
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,210
It really is.

361
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,190
It really is that easy.

362
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:11,870
All right.

363
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:12,610
Here we go again.

364
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:14,990
All right.

365
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,020
What can I say?

366
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,700
Nines... nine point seventy-four.

367
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,700
I told you I'd even bring out my scale.

368
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,100
Look at that.

369
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,640
I opened three packs.

370
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,620
I got the gold edition.

371
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,100
What can I say?

372
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,400
I told you, my shop is not rigged.

373
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,540
It's not rigged!

374
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,380
How can it be rigged?

375
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,500
Oh, I don't have anything to buy right now.

376
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,220
Give me a sec.

377
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,260
Okay, we'll buy another pack here.

378
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,280
Purchase.

379
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,980
Okay, and then what do I need?

380
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:21,940
Upgrade shop?

381
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,160
How do I upgrade shop?

382
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,360
Reach shop?

383
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,980
Oh, reach shop level.

384
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,900
Okay, here we go.

385
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,140
Alright.

386
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,720
Just put more here.

387
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,540
You're just jealous because I have a better card shop than you.

388
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,800
You're jealous because you know you should have bought from my store instead of ordering online.

389
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,580
Yeah, I ordered online, but everything I order is gold.

390
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,320
Look at that.

391
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:59,520
$4.48, $5.92, and a $9.74.

392
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,660
Look at this.

393
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:01,940
$4.48.

394
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,160
First edition for you.

395
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,360
Look at that.

396
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,900
The third pack I opened.

397
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,520
Look at that.

398
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,880
You wish you were me.

399
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,800
I have the magic touch.

400
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,480
Alright, see?

401
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,580
They all heard.

402
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,620
They all heard about the magic of my store.

403
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,160
I'm making an investment.

404
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,040
I'm going to open another one.

405
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,100
Watch this.

406
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,160
Open pack.

407
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,840
Watch this.

408
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,260
That easy.

409
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,580
Did you guys hear the word of the magic of the store?

410
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,320
Did you all banter?

411
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,080
Somebody said...

412
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,720
Stop it, please.

413
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,960
Did you all hear?

414
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,600
Did you all stop taking all of them?

415
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,500
Hear the beauty of my shop?

416
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,220
Buy a table and put it in the shop?

417
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,200
Why do I want them to loiter?

418
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,280
I don't want them to loiter.

419
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,280
You're just here to buy the cards and leave.

420
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,400
Okay, we'll put it...

421
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,440
What if I just put it...

422
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,060
I'll put it here.

423
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,260
For atmosphere.

424
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,160
For atmosphere.

425
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,980
What are they going to do?

426
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,880
They're just going to play cards?

427
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,580
To bring their own cards in my store?

428
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,660
How dare they?

429
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,580
They're not even buying these cards from my store.

430
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,520
Billy, thank you for the super chat.

431
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:02,960
Thank you.

432
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,580
Thank you.

433
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,080
Tokyo, are you rubbing the cards like Steven Chao and the God of Gambling?

434
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,140
Thank you for the super chat.

435
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:09,560
Thank you.

436
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,160
Thank you.

437
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,040
Candy, thank you for the super chat.

438
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,400
Thank you.

439
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:12,720
Thank you.

440
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,380
Tokyo, please.

441
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,860
I own $150 magic to gathering card.

442
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,620
So get that.

443
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,540
That $9 weak sauce out of here.

444
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:29,520
Look, Magic the Gathering had fucking years, decades to build popularity, increase in value, tear- I'll just say it.

445
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,540
Tetra- is it Tetramon?

446
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,080
Tetramon?

447
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,040
Tetra- Tetramon just came out last week, guys.

448
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,640
It doesn't have a legacy yet.

449
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,640
I didn't even know its existence until like today.

450
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:46,640
Okay.

451
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,600
It doesn't- it just came out last week.

452
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,620
It doesn't have a legacy yet.

453
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,300
Alright.

454
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:05,380
In 20 years, my $9 card is gonna be like 50- no, I'm just- no, maybe $30.

455
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,680
My $9 card will be $30.

456
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,160
This isn't accurate.

457
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,640
The butt crack's not showing.

458
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,600
Oh, I kicked them out.

459
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,260
Leave!

460
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,700
I'm having an event right now!

461
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,020
Leave!

462
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,700
Leave, nerds!

463
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,860
Paying customers only!

464
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,420
Not ranked 100%.

465
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,160
Alright.

466
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,100
Nice.

467
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,840
That's right.

468
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,900
You gotta pay a fee if you wanna use my table.

469
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,000
Wow, there's so many holo cards in circulation.

470
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,220
Computer, search Tetramon inflation.

471
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,840
Thank you, Super Chat.

472
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,980
Thank you, thank you.

473
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,060
That's right.

474
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,560
Loser has to pay- buy 10 packs of cards.

475
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,820
Winner can only buy- only buy 5.

476
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,420
So I think that's pretty good.

477
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,380
And every card pack- is guaranteed holo, so you'll get your money back.

478
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,940
Don't worry, you'll definitely get your money back.

479
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,940
Wait, check my phone.

480
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,540
What's wrong with my phone?

481
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,460
Oh, wait.

482
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,580
There's inflation?

483
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,120
There's fucking inflation?

484
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,480
No.

485
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,360
I'm supposed to leave reality.

486
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:43,040
What the- I will be scammed.

487
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,380
I will be scammed.

488
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,600
I will be scammed.

489
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,340
A basic card pack sure is expensive.

490
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,980
Of course they are!

491
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,760
You'll get your money's worth back!

492
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,400
I swear to God, you'll get your money worth.

493
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,340
Can you get a card pack, pay bills?

494
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,600
What do I have to check?

495
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,820
The simulation is getting too real.

496
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,640
Alright, nice.

497
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,240
Buy more tables?

498
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,380
I don't want- Really?

499
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,320
I gotta let more of them- am I?

500
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,720
Am I a store?

501
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,000
But like, I'm here to sell.

502
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,600
Not for loiter.

503
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,860
I don't want to be a loiter.

504
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,440
Alright.

505
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,300
Where do I put it here?

506
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,240
I'll put it here.

507
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,660
Oh, so people will know it's a friendly environment.

508
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,240
Oh my God!

509
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,460
He bought so many!

510
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,520
I'm rich!

511
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,380
We don't need lights.

512
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,880
I don't think I have lights.

513
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,760
No, we don't need the lights.

514
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,220
We need a safe.

515
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,500
We need to save the environment, guys.

516
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,540
We need to save the environment.

517
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:59,100
Okay, if I put the table in front of the store, they'll think that like, I have- They'll think it'll be a really nice, like, environment, you know?

518
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,620
A nice atmospheric world.

519
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,060
Alright, let me buy more cards.

520
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,520
Oh, I can buy 64 now!

521
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:06,900
Nice!

522
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,120
Oh.

523
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,080
Oh, it's a license.

524
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,180
I have to have a license to sell more cards?

525
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,540
Oh my God, this is where my taxes go to.

526
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,340
Alright, we'll put all of this here.

527
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:28,850
Nice.

528
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:29,790
Is that all of them?

529
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,130
Yeah.

530
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:31,510
I'm through.

531
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,710
Okay, you played the card game, now you have to stay here.

532
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,210
Alright, might as well open some cards too.

533
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:37,970
Alright.

534
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:39,210
Zoom!

535
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:41,170
Okay.

536
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:44,530
Come on.

537
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,520
Guys, you see that?

538
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,980
That's a guaranteed holo right there.

539
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,820
This one right here.

540
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,220
Guys.

541
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,120
Guys, that's- Guys, the holo is right there.

542
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,180
Did you guys see it?

543
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,120
Did you- Did you guys see it?

544
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:00,420
Look!

545
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,720
It's the new box!

546
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,840
It's the new box!

547
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,180
Alright?

548
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,300
It's the new box!

549
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:04,640
Oh!

550
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,880
Oh, wait!

551
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,540
There's a holo right there!

552
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,600
There's a holo!

553
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:08,740
See?

554
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,480
They put all the holos here!

555
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:11,320
Oh!

556
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,260
Look at that!

557
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,060
Guaranteed holo!

558
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,060
Guaranteed holo!

559
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:16,680
Oh!

560
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,060
Two holos!

561
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,380
Two holos!

562
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,460
I told you!

563
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:25,180
We don't have a holo on that one, but we have holos in two packs, guys!

564
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,740
We had a holo in two packs!

565
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,020
Oh!

566
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,620
Look at that!

567
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,260
Fucking easy!

568
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,060
And another?

569
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:39,640
Oh!

570
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:40,980
Wow!

571
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,900
So- Oh!

572
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,880
And a no-

573
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,880
And it's a first edition!

574
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,680
Oh my god!

575
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,760
You guys all judged me!

576
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,660
Alright.

577
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,420
Let's see.

578
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,780
Where's my...

579
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,220
Where's my fucking...

580
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:58,960
Do I need to pay biz?

581
00:24:59,260 --> 00:24:59,920
No, I don't.

582
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,380
Thank god.

583
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,300
Okay.

584
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,160
Where's my...

585
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,060
How do I look at my...

586
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,120
Oh, here we go.

587
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,200
Look at that.

588
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,520
Force...

589
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,500
Look at this.

590
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:11,340
You wish you had your hands on the guppy right now.

591
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,960
Look at this card.

592
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,220
You can see the rainbow.

593
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,680
An EX common.

594
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,040
And a first edition common!

595
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:23,740
Look at that!

596
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,340
Oh my god, you should have bought your cards at my store.

597
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,260
That's on you.

598
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,320
And look at this!

599
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,200
A basic common foil!

600
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,040
Oh my god!

601
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,680
And I have two of these!

602
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,600
Look at that.

603
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,920
And I'm gonna sell all of them.

604
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,720
Yeah, that's right!

605
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,660
I'm not even gonna collect these.

606
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,740
I'm gonna sell the...

607
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,160
Oh, this is the worst part.

608
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,520
I am a for-profit card shop owner!

609
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,900
It's not even for passion!

610
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,260
I opened this store for profit!

611
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,600
And look at my lo-

612
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,560
You monster!

613
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,180
It's not even for passion!

614
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,240
No way!

615
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:31,940
Okay.

616
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,860
Oh shit.

617
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,800
I lost money.

618
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,340
Oh, it's because I kept buying stuff.

619
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,660
I didn't lose money.

620
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,580
I just kept buying upgrades.

621
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,300
I'm a scalper.

622
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,040
That's right.

623
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:47,240
I'm gonna go up there and bring my scal- Oh, oh.

624
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:47,660
Wait, wait.

625
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:47,940
I'm sorry.

626
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,760
I'm actually open.

627
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,980
No, come back!

628
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,800
I'm actually...

629
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,220
Come back!

630
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:52,980
I'm actually open!

631
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,380
I...

632
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,960
No, please come back!

633
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,300
Alright,

634
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,280
I...

635
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,020
I'm open.

636
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,800
Guys, I'm open for real now!

637
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,040
I'm open for real.

638
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,920
Guys, come back!

639
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:09,960
Guys, please!

640
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,320
I love card games!

641
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,020
Guys, I love card games so much!

642
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,780
I'm passionate!

643
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,760
I'm...

644
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,280
I'm so...

645
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,360
I'm so...

646
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:20,960
I'm so...

647
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,520
I'm so passionate!

648
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,040
Please!

649
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,600
Okay,

650
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,660
anyway, I can tell the story about...

651
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,540
So, not story, but like...

652
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:37,020
Another reason why people don't buy from stores anymore...

653
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,120
They try to buy from the official place.

654
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:46,460
It's that it's really hard to find trustworthy places to buy card packs.

655
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,980
Because you can weigh card packs to find rare cards.

656
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,960
So, like, certain card packs are...

657
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,580
Like, heavier card packs are considered, like, the good ones.

658
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,860
Because the holos tend to be heavier.

659
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:02,880
Yeah.

660
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,060
So, like, people would just grab the...

661
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,100
They would just grab the holo packs.

662
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,380
And then, like, holo cards out of the packs.

663
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,360
And then put, like, commons in it.

664
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,960
And then reseal it to sell.

665
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,780
Yeah, and that's mostly for Pokemon cards.

666
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,100
I don't know if, like, Yu-Gi-Oh cards have that too.

667
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,960
But I know that...

668
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,940
Like, um...

669
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,220
I know, like, Pokemon cards had that issue.

670
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,300
Anyway, I...

671
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,580
My store doesn't do that, guys.

672
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,440
My store...

673
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,240
Just so you know...

674
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,180
My store does not do that.

675
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,320
Because everybody gets guaranteed holos.

676
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,560
It's real.

677
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,860
It's so real.

678
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:44,980
Alright.

679
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,580
Small metal rack plate.

680
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,680
Do I need more tables?

681
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,940
I mean, I might as well.

682
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,620
I'll grab another table.

683
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,760
I wanna make my store seem like it's alive.

684
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,220
Okay, let's see.

685
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,160
Oh, wait.

686
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,980
I don't have, like, space anymore.

687
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,580
I say as I have this...

688
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,620
Guys, you don't understand.

689
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,020
This is my box corner.

690
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,160
You don't understand.

691
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,340
This is the corner for my boxes.

692
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,640
Like, it's...

693
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,980
It's very important.

694
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,800
We'll put it in this corner right here.

695
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,720
Can he even sit there?

696
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,520
I think he can.

697
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:22,980
Oh, wait.

698
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:23,440
I have a line.

699
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,420
I didn't know that's possible.

700
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:30,900
Okay, nice.

701
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,800
This guy bought a lot.

702
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,900
You can tell he's passionate.

703
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,200
Oh.

704
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,140
Oh, no.

705
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,800
Oh, no.

706
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:42,840
No.

707
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:43,920
No.

708
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:44,800
No.

709
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,720
How do I...

710
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,860
I don't wanna give him $20.

711
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,880
I was like, how do I...

712
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,600
How do I give him...

713
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,200
Okay.

714
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,320
Unlock.

715
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:57,880
Shop.

716
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,320
Upgrade.

717
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,800
I don't get...

718
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,420
Oh, shit.

719
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,540
I get a cleanser?

720
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,240
What is this for?

721
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:04,980
Oh, my God.

722
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,300
I can buy figures.

723
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,280
Am I just selling, like, one thing?

724
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,360
Oh, there you go.

725
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,380
Shop expansion.

726
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,000
How do I...

727
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,660
What's the...

728
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:15,700
What's the...

729
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:15,960
Level three.

730
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,720
What is considered level three?

731
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,180
Oh, I don't have it.

732
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:21,440
Okay.

733
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,320
Let's get...

734
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:22,540
No.

735
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,960
We don't need a bigger store.

736
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:24,960
Anyway.

737
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,760
This is insane.

738
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,640
Look.

739
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:31,620
It's like...

740
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,320
Yo, yo.

741
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,080
You wanna see again?

742
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:33,880
Watch this.

743
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,520
Oh, my God.

744
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,460
Already.

745
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,010
So easy.

746
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,290
Oh, my God.

747
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,250
Oh, my God.

748
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,150
Oh, my God.

749
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:50,690
I feel so...

750
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:51,090
Look at that.

751
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,570
Look at that.

752
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,950
Another one.

753
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,550
Look at that.

754
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:57,810
I told you guys.

755
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:03,010
Every pack I open is magic.

756
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,730
I hate to...

757
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,430
What?

758
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:06,930
This guy heard...

759
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:09,270
This guy heard about my magic store.

760
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,750
My magic store.

761
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,790
He wants in on it.

762
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,290
He was watching the stream and it instantly ran over.

763
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:20,150
He wanted in on it.

764
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:24,870
He ran, he ran to my store.

765
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:40,110
I, guys, by the way, I live stream, you know, those chat, YouTube channels and, like, TikToks that, like, advertise their store by, like, doing, like, day-to-day life of, like, ex, like, what they do, like, at, like, their restaurant store, etc.

766
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:43,410
This is the day-to-day life of a Tetramon store owner.

767
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:48,370
And he, I was live streaming my card openings and he let, he fucking ran.

768
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:48,970
Oh, my gosh!

769
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:51,070
This girl is watching my stream, too!

770
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,630
They're watching my Tetramon stream!

771
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:56,190
My Tetramon pack opening!

772
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:01,110
She also heard about it!

773
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:07,530
They all heard about the Tetramon card openings.

774
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,210
Card table.

775
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:10,570
Oh, my God, it's time.

776
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,070
My for-profit store.

777
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:19,810
The magic touch, the non-rig store.

778
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,110
Okay.

779
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:23,550
One dollar.

780
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,150
There we go.

781
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,070
Alright, here we go.

782
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:26,270
Open.

783
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,970
Okay, can I put this here?

784
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,270
Where do I put this?

785
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,070
Oh, I'll put it...

786
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,150
Put it here.

787
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,210
Oh, it has to be, like...

788
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:36,970
Oh, I'll put it here.

789
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:37,670
There we go.

790
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,210
And then, I'll put my cards in.

791
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:43,730
Alright, how is, what's the market value?

792
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,950
Twenty-two dollars.

793
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:49,530
That's right.

794
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:49,810
That's right.

795
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,610
I touched it, so it's worth more.

796
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,410
They'll buy it eventually.

797
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:02,570
Somebody will buy it.

798
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,610
It has my magic touch, guys.

799
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,150
Alright, let's see.

800
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:14,250
Sixteen.

801
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,050
There we go.

802
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,050
They'll buy it.

803
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:17,950
I know they will.

804
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:25,930
I know, these guys don't know about the internet.

805
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:29,090
That's why they walked all the way down here.

806
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,270
Oh, I put on my glasses.

807
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:37,570
I put on my glasses to sell the fact that I know what I'm doing.

808
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,430
Okay, uh...

809
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,450
Oh, it's nine.

810
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:41,530
Okay, let's see.

811
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:42,410
Five dollars?

812
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:54,010
That's right, buy my cards!

813
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,710
Buy my cards!

814
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,630
Alright, let's see.

815
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,610
Alright, let's put that here too.

816
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,190
Uh...

817
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:07,870
Eight dollars.

818
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:08,870
Nice.

819
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,750
Oh, he's gonna buy it.

820
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,710
Wait, wait, wait.

821
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:15,770
He will buy it, guys.

822
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:19,310
If you don't understand, he will eventually buy it.

823
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:19,950
You know?

824
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,790
You sound less evil.

825
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:28,450
What do you mean?

826
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,730
Alright, let's see.

827
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:31,570
Eight dollars.

828
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:41,050
But I touched it!

829
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,730
I touched it though!

830
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:50,090
Don't keep really looking, placing cards like Mr. Higsby from Mega Man Battle.

831
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:50,970
No way!

832
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:53,630
Thank you for the super chat, Johnny!

833
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,350
Thank you, thank you!

834
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:57,730
Guys, come on!

835
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,410
I touched it!

836
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:02,250
It was on my livestream!

837
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,790
These cards were on my livestream!

838
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:11,570
They're literally on my livestream!

839
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,710
They're literally on my livestream!

840
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,670
I'm telling you, it's a famous card!

841
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:17,010
It's...

842
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,330
Alright, let's see.

843
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,110
I'm going... watch this.

844
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,230
We'll do two pack openings.

845
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:27,230
Oh!

846
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:36,770
What can I say?

847
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:39,690
Every pack!

848
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,590
Just... every pack!

849
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,230
Every...

850
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,530
Every single pack!

851
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,670
It's just that easy!

852
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,850
Every single pack is magic!

853
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,110
Every...

854
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:02,250
Every single one of them!

855
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,870
It's not a scam!

856
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,450
My...

857
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:09,010
My Tetramon...

858
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:17,530
Tetramon store owner, um, underscore 100% is not rigged!

859
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,510
Champion Mel!

860
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,470
Thank you for the super chat!

861
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:21,490
Thank you, thank you!

862
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:22,890
This is my last money.

863
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:23,950
Can I have the worm?

864
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,190
I wanna be a worm!

865
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:26,370
Thank you for the super chat!

866
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,430
Thank you, thank you!

867
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,650
It's not a scam!

868
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:31,110
Every pack I open is just magic!

869
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:34,170
It's not rigged 100%!

870
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:38,650
This used to be the nicest neighborhood!

871
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,750
Wait, the table's not making money?

872
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,510
Stop loitering!

873
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:47,990
Okay...

874
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:49,990
Okay...

875
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:52,810
Um...

876
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,190
Fees are collected after players?

877
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:57,690
Alright.

878
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:00,530
There we go.

879
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:03,630
Now it's $10.

880
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:06,650
Fee is too high here?!

881
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,350
Can't decide if I really want this.

882
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,710
There's no way.

883
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:14,470
There's no way.

884
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:17,550
It's not even that expensive!

885
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,790
It's literally...

886
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:20,490
Oh, right there.

887
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:22,890
Holy shit.

888
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:26,410
You complain about my fees but then you buy these many cards.

889
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,970
Like, pick a struggle.

890
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,450
I know you're addicted.

891
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:33,330
I know you're addicted.

892
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:35,330
You can complain all you want.

893
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:38,190
You can complain all you want.

894
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,370
But you know you can't leave.

895
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:42,230
You know you can't stop yourself.

896
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:46,390
Fine!

897
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,170
Fine, we'll go back to...

898
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:50,670
We'll go back to this.

899
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:51,070
Okay.

900
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:55,050
Changing prices is a niche issue.

901
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:58,130
Mom, why won't anybody buy these cards?

902
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,250
I literally touched them.

903
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,130
I don't understand.

904
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:08,570
Maybe if I move it closer to them so they have to see it then people will buy it.

905
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:09,130
There we go.

906
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,730
They have to look at it now.

907
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:15,510
No, we gotta save the environment!

908
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:19,330
We have to save the environment, guys!

909
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,630
Guys, we have to.

910
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:23,110
Alright.

911
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:26,450
Since nobody's coming in right now, I can...

912
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:27,670
It's time.

913
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:28,790
Wait.

914
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,030
Why can't I...

915
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,950
Why won't it let me...

916
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:36,410
Guys, it's not letting me pick up a card.

917
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:44,270
You don't need to see!

918
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:50,730
Why can't it... Why won't it let me open my card?

919
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:52,450
No!

920
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,530
Oh, it's right-click.

921
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:57,110
Sorry.

922
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:58,750
I was left-clicking.

923
00:38:59,250 --> 00:38:59,850
That

924
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,760
easy.

925
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,260
It's 0.95, but it's still a card valued.

926
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,840
It still has value.

927
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,060
This card still has value, guys.

928
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,820
It's still considered a holo.

929
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:18,500
It's...

930
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,620
It's still considered a holo.

931
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:26,700
Wait.

932
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,680
What's going on?

933
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,300
What's going on?

934
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,860
What happened to my magic touch?

935
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,160
What happened?

936
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,880
What happened to my magic touch?

937
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,260
What's going on?

938
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,920
What's going on?

939
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:38,640
No!

940
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:40,760
What's going...

941
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,560
What happened?

942
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,440
Where are they?

943
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,820
What happened to my magic touch, guys?

944
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,620
It's because it's...

945
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:48,820
Okay.

946
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,040
It's because it's nighttime.

947
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,680
It's because it's... Leave.

948
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,400
Leave my sword right now.

949
00:39:53,680 --> 00:40:01,200
Leave my sword right now.

950
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,340
You're ruining my magic.

951
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,600
You're ruining my magic.

952
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,880
I need you to leave.

953
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,000
I need...

954
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,620
I need you to leave.

955
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,340
My magic only works in day.

956
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:17,960
Alright.

957
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,260
That's fine.

958
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,140
You guys will...

959
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,320
He's looking at it.

960
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,380
He's looking at it.

961
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,300
Oh, dear.

962
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,280
I need to think.

963
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,880
Oh, just think for... Oh.

964
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,140
You're still gonna pay, though.

965
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,040
I knew it.

966
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:30,920
You're addicted.

967
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:31,840
You can't...

968
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,680
You can't stop yourself.

969
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,200
I'm not sca...

970
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,200
Oh, this poor guy.

971
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,120
Nobody likes you or wants to play with you.

972
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,880
You poor... Now, leave my store, please.

973
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,760
It's just three.

974
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,860
Just only three people are not happy.

975
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,160
No friends.

976
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:54,560
Alright.

977
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,240
I told you.

978
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,840
My magic only works in daytime.

979
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:02,420
The moment... The moment it starts getting dark, I told you.

980
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,040
It's just because it was nighttime.

981
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,680
My magic... My magic touch stops after like...

982
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,460
After 7 p.m.

983
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,580
No way.

984
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,340
I told you.

985
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,260
I told you.

986
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,260
It's solar powered.

987
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:21,820
Exactly.

988
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,220
It's solar powered right there.

989
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,920
See, look at that.

990
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,380
6.18.

991
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,720
Look at that.

992
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,080
And she rises again.

993
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,660
When the sun isn't out.

994
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,180
I lose the magic touch.

995
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,060
Oh, hey.

996
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,600
We'll grab this.

997
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,240
And then we'll grab a regular.

998
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:48,680
Alright.

999
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,520
Open the store?

1000
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,600
Look, I was busy trying to...

1001
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,280
I was busy doing my...

1002
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,180
I was busy opening card packs that...

1003
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:02,960
How many did she fucking... She just took the entire...

1004
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,640
This guy just took everything.

1005
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,120
He heard it was daytime, so he had to come in.

1006
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,080
He...

1007
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:14,760
He heard it was daytime, so he came in and took all the stock.

1008
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,600
He's like, I heard the magic starts in day.

1009
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,980
I gotta take everything now.

1010
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,640
How much did he fucking buy?

1011
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,880
Oh, shit.

1012
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:27,760
Okay.

1013
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:28,160
Nice.

1014
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,200
Oh, he's going to...

1015
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,160
Oh, he's going... Oh, sorry, bro.

1016
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,660
She was already there.

1017
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,260
Breaking news.

1018
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:35,940
It's...

1019
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:36,820
Daytime.

1020
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,440
Wait, what's this?

1021
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,340
Oh, it's the boxes!

1022
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,400
Okay.

1023
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,980
My box corner.

1024
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,460
Alright, let's see.

1025
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,400
Thirty dollars.

1026
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,240
Twenty... Oh, nice!

1027
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,940
That should sell.

1028
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,280
It'll sell eventually.

1029
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,500
It'll sell eventually, guys.

1030
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:05,080
Okay, maybe... Okay, I'll drop the price down by a little bit.

1031
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,880
I should really fix the toggle.

1032
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,520
Alright, give me a sec.

1033
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,500
I'm gonna fix...

1034
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,400
I'm gonna disappear for a little bit.

1035
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:21,980
I'm gonna disappear for a little bit.

1036
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,240
Every time I do prices.

1037
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:28,420
Alright.

1038
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,140
Alright, we're fine now.

1039
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,620
Okay, we should be good.

1040
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:35,980
Alright, guys.

1041
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,820
Okay, I'm gonna just...

1042
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,980
I'm gonna adjust the prices just a little bit.

1043
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:41,800
Alright?

1044
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,580
I'm not greedy, but I know my worth.

1045
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,580
These guys haven't heard of eBay yet.

1046
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:53,640
They haven't heard of eBay yet, so we have hope.

1047
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,620
Because, like, why would they...

1048
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:59,620
They haven't heard of eBay or, like, buying from the official places.

1049
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,600
So, like, why are they here?

1050
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,180
Okay, let's see.

1051
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:04,940
Oh, no.

1052
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:06,780
$7.

1053
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,820
It'll get bought eventually, I believe.

1054
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:09,940
Alright.

1055
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:12,820
$21.

1056
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,040
I know you'll buy this.

1057
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,700
I know you're gonna buy one.

1058
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:17,480
Come on.

1059
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,840
Come on.

1060
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,500
It's... See, I told you!

1061
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,040
I told you!

1062
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:22,520
Oh!

1063
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,200
There we go!

1064
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,400
I knew it.

1065
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,920
I knew eventually one of you will fold.

1066
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:29,620
I...

1067
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:37,880
I knew eventually one of you will fold.

1068
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,020
Oh!

1069
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,900
He bought all three of my boxes!

1070
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:45,660
That's right!

1071
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,300
And another one?

1072
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,620
This one was the most scammy of them all!

1073
00:44:58,790 --> 00:44:59,870
I knew it.

1074
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:01,890
That's true.

1075
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:02,850
eBay is much worse.

1076
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:05,350
eBay, you can't even, like, control it as well.

1077
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:06,070
Okay.

1078
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:07,010
Oh, alright.

1079
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:07,910
$33.

1080
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:09,970
There we go.

1081
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:10,990
We'll have two.

1082
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:13,330
I'm not scamming!

1083
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:14,090
Alright, enough.

1084
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:16,130
Alright, let's buy more boxes.

1085
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:16,570
Oh, hey!

1086
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:18,270
I got... Oh, that 8-pack!

1087
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:19,670
I have enough for that, right?

1088
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:21,270
No, I should just buy one of this.

1089
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:22,290
Alright.

1090
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:22,990
Nice.

1091
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:27,450
I still haven't sold 10 cards yet to a customer, but that's okay.

1092
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:28,150
That doesn't matter.

1093
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:29,510
I'm here for profit.

1094
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:32,870
Alright.

1095
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:33,270
Nice.

1096
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:33,710
Okay.

1097
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:36,430
Eventually, they'll buy all of this.

1098
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:38,710
When can I, like, have somebody?

1099
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:40,450
Uh...

1100
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:41,210
No, not this.

1101
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:41,910
Wait, what?

1102
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:43,050
Can I change the standard?

1103
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:46,510
Oh, I can't change all of that yet.

1104
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:47,930
Okay, uh, recruit.

1105
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:50,230
Um, Zachary Cole.

1106
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:52,790
I worked in a shop for a few months and gained...

1107
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:55,230
These guys don't, like, look like they're teenagers.

1108
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:00,650
My cards!

1109
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:03,410
Nice.

1110
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:05,350
You saw it on my YouTube channel.

1111
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:07,110
Guys, my YouTube channel's popping off!

1112
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:07,890
My...

1113
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:12,570
Guys, I can't believe it!

1114
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:15,550
My YouTube channel's popping off, guys!

1115
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:24,170
What?

1116
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:25,590
It's a part of the experience.

1117
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:28,750
You hire teenagers so you can pay them less.

1118
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:35,670
And then be like, hey, like, I might pay you less, but I can let you open some of the card packs at my store.

1119
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:39,130
Let's see.

1120
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:40,550
We'll buy...

1121
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:44,010
Oh, it's a quest bud?

1122
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:45,370
Oh well.

1123
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:47,430
Okay, yeah.

1124
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:48,410
Holy shit!

1125
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:50,970
Number one.

1126
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:55,630
Tetramon shop owner underscore 100 fan.

1127
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:56,790
Right here.

1128
00:46:57,330 --> 00:46:59,150
This guy just likes my store.

1129
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:02,710
Oh my god, and he's paid $150?

1130
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:05,710
Holy shit.

1131
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:09,230
Addiction personified.

1132
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:14,270
Yeah, I give them store credits so I don't have to pay them.

1133
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:17,790
That's the best part.

1134
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:20,550
Guys, I'm an ethical store owner.

1135
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:28,090
I...

1136
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:29,730
Okay, solar power time.

1137
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:31,430
Alright, what did I get?

1138
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:33,550
Look at that.

1139
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:36,490
Look at that.

1140
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:37,230
Look at that.

1141
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:38,330
I told you!

1142
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:41,310
It only works when the sun is up!

1143
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:47,090
It's just that easy.

1144
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:51,610
The moment the sun rises, it's over.

1145
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:57,110
Ringed and scammed.

1146
00:47:57,230 --> 00:47:58,990
It's not rigged!

1147
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:03,390
I'm just... My store is just very... Look at that.

1148
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:04,350
...

1149
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:04,670
...

1150
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:08,910
...

1151
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:11,510
Embrace the sun!

1152
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:12,250
Exactly!

1153
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:14,590
Alright.

1154
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:15,430
Nice.

1155
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:16,670
...

1156
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:17,490
...

1157
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:18,050
...

1158
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:24,930
It's not my fault you guys don't have the power of the sun by your side.

1159
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:25,770
...

1160
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:26,550
...

1161
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:30,490
The magic touch.

1162
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:33,770
Not legally proven to be rigged.

1163
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:34,210
Exactly!

1164
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:38,510
If it was rigged, why would the government let me name my store this?

1165
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:40,630
Why was my business approved?

1166
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:42,330
Alright.

1167
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:43,930
Four dollars.

1168
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:46,950
There you go.

1169
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:48,610
Jeez, wait!

1170
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:50,510
Do you see a scale here?

1171
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:55,010
If I was weighing my... Okay, have you ever seen those like YouTube channels?

1172
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:56,530
Or like YouTube shorts?

1173
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:57,890
Where like, they...

1174
00:48:58,490 --> 00:48:59,950
They clear... They're like...

1175
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:06,530
I'm gonna let... I'm gonna let a card shop owner pick a pack for me and then I'm gonna open it at home.

1176
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:12,890
And then it's clear that they like swap the packs to like a rare pack and be like, Oh my god!

1177
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:18,190
The store owner picked this pack and I got a first edition Charizard!

1178
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:20,110
Oh my god!

1179
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:20,530
God!

1180
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,640
Anyway, I'm not doing that of course.

1181
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,060
That's not my YouTube channel.

1182
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:33,460
Like, we're here for the authentic ca... the authentic experience here.

1183
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:39,120
We're here for the authentic experience.

1184
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,260
Alright, let's see.

1185
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,460

00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:45,440
I have the money now for this.

00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:47,340
Alright.

1189
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:47,580

Wait, where did... Did I not buy this?

1192
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:55,940
Oh, I didn't check out.

1193
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,340
Okay, I was like, what the fuck?

1194
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:58,340
I thought it was instant.

1195
00:49:59,120 --> 00:49:59,560
Alright.

1196
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,620
Nice, the eight pack.

1197
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,640
Okay.

1198
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,200
Into the corner you go.

1199
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,880
Thanks for buying my shop.

1200
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,440

00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,240
I got a first edition Charizard.

1202
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:20,720
Meanwhile, the pack was Yu-Gi-Oh!

1203
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,500
Alright, let's see.

1204
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,000
Small card display.

1205
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,280
The auto scent.

1206
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,160
The fuck is an auto scent?

1207
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:33,540
Card table, single side, small personal shelf.

1208
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,820
Oh, I should... The metal rack!

1209
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,820
The actual real TCG experience.

1210
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:41,660
I haven't been to like a...

1211
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:46,380
I haven't been to like a comic book store in a long ass time though.

1212
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:50,060
Um, I don't have anything to put it there.

1213
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,660

00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,720
Wait, let me put... Actually, I'm gonna move this next to the counter.

00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:00,240
Now!

1217
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,240
When you're waiting in line.

1218
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:05,860
You know when you're waiting in line and you see like the rack?

1219
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:11,120
And then you're like, oh wait let me look at the rack before like see if I actually want anything.

1220
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,780

00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:22,560
The temptation rack.

1223
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,440
The impulsive fires.

1224
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:29,380
It needs to be against the wall.

1225
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,080
That's true.

1226
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,140
Right here.

1227
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,100
Oh, there it is.

1228
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,880

I got the money already.

1233
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:45,900
I need to spend money exactly.

00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,600
Wait, do I have enough?

1235
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:49,880
Do I have enough to buy an extra?

1236
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,960
Oh no, I don't.

1237
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:52,900
What about accessories?

1238
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,240
Do I need this?

1239
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:55,620

00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,160
Wait, I should buy some card sleeves.

1243
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:02,060
Guys, can you guys please spend some money?

1244
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:02,580

00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:09,300
Guys, can you guys please spend some money?

00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:12,840
I need... I need... Okay, let's open some more packs, guys.

1247
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,580
Oh no, the sun is coming down.

1248
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,240
The sun is coming down.

1249
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:17,580
No!

1250
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:19,160
The sun is coming down!

1251
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:19,960
No!

1252
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,310
The sun was...

1253
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:31,460
No!

1254
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:36,890
No!

1255
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:42,670
I just realized it.

1256
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:45,230
What bills?

1257
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:46,350
Oh, that bill.

1258
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:47,270
Whoops.

1259
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:48,450
Okay.

1260
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:49,310
Oh, look at that!

1261
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:51,630
Look at how low my electricity bill was!

1262
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:58,570
I like how my electricity bill was so low because I don't turn on the lights.

1263
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:02,150
Guys, please.

1264
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:04,470
I need... Oh, I forgot to set the price for this.

1265
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:05,890
Five.

1266
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:09,810
The electric bill is crazy, I heard.

1267
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:11,610
Just to thank you for the super chat.

1268
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:13,690
Now if you don't, you turn on the lights.

1269
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:16,130
I'm here to save the environment here.

1270
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:22,150
I'm the reverse vampire.

1271
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:25,910
Guys, I need you guys to hurry up.

1272
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:31,510
Guys, if you're not gonna pay, I need you to hurry up, guys.

1273
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:32,590
Please.

1274
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:34,490
Oh, look at all his rare cards.

1275
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:36,330
Oh, you can't see because the lights are off.

1276
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:37,170
Buddy.

1277
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:37,830
Buddy.

1278
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:39,950
We're one hour till closing time.

1279
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:41,270
Nobody is here to play.

1280
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:41,790
with you.

1281
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:42,490
Like...

1282
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:43,650
UNLESS!

1283
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:46,650
Never mind.

1284
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:49,210
I forgot you have friends.

1285
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:57,250
Sorry, I got you mixed up with that other guy in the corner that had nobody else playing with him.

1286
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:03,090
Unless he called a friend.

1287
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:05,810
Sorry, I got him confused with that other guy.

1288
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:08,490
You know that other guy that sat in the corner for two hours?

1289
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:10,090
I thought that was him.

1290
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:13,250
I just... I can't have him loitering.

1291
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:15,610
I just can't have these guys loitering.

1292
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:16,010
Chat.

1293
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:18,430
Like, I'm here to run a business.

1294
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:22,810
I'm here to run a business.

1295
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:25,610
I feel personally attacked.

1296
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:27,530
Oh, nice.

1297
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:28,690
He bought two boosters.

1298
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:30,490
Oh, that's sixty dollars.

1299
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:33,710
Sixty smackaroonies right here.

1300
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:35,510
Oh, and they're gonna play card games.

1301
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:37,090
Okay, we're gonna wait until these guys finish.

1302
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:38,550
Because I need to get paid.

1303
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:39,450
I need...

1304
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:42,910
I need to get paid.

1305
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:43,710
I need these guys.

1306
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:45,310
And he's looking at the cards.

1307
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:49,090
Oh, I can get them to pay in advance?

1308
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:51,350
No, I can't.

1309
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:52,350
That moves the cards.

1310
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:56,110
Oh, he bought one of the rare cards!

1311
00:54:58,570 --> 00:54:58,990
Nice.

1312
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:00,770
Okay, and I can put another one in here.

1313
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:02,990
How much is that?

1314
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:04,950
Okay, I can put six dollars.

1315
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:06,730
I can upsold it.

1316
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:08,230
Alright, guys.

1317
00:55:08,290 --> 00:55:09,650
I need you guys to hurry up.

1318
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:11,710
Guys, I need you guys.

1319
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:14,830
Why would I close the store if I can get money?

1320
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:15,350
Oh, wait.

1321
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:16,250
My store's not closed!

1322
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:16,930
Come in here!

1323
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:18,290
No, come back!

1324
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,010
I can see the wallet!

1325
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,020
Guys, I can see!

1326
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,480
I know you want cards!

1327
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:29,660
Guys, please.

1328
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:31,700
Please.

1329
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:35,840
Guys, please.

1330
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:36,500
Please.

1331
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,280
Come on.

1332
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,520
Card game cannot be that long.

1333
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,820
Don't step on their cards.

1334
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,040
Gonna lose value.

1335
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,300
If I lose...

1336
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:48,900
That means they need replacements.

1337
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:55,680
If I step on their cards, they're gonna wanna replace those cards for these brand new cards right here.

1338
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,140
Created 10 PSA 10 right here.

1339
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:04,120
All these cards that are not in any sleeves or containers are PSA 10.

1340
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:13,720
Alright.

1341
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,060
This is here.

1342
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:19,140
By the way, I own a PSA grading company too.

1343
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:27,100
I also own the PSA company that grades these cards.

1344
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:29,740
Alright.

1345
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:31,520
Where the hell are the lights?

1346
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,480
I am a small business owner.

1347
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,840
Please don't criticize...

1348
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,360
I'm just a small business owner.

1349
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:44,260
Guys.

1350
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:46,480
Please.

1351
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:49,320
I'm just trying to make it in this world.

1352
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:53,400
Sorry.

1353
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,840
I'm not big like Toys R Us.

1354
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,920
I'm just trying to make it.

1355
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:58,880
Alright.

1356
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,440
We'll buy the regular packs here.

1357
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:06,060
So we can check out.

1358
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:06,760
Nice.

1359
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,120
Okay.

1360
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:11,180
I have five more days.

1361
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:15,580
I will put these booster packs here to tempt them.

1362
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:20,000
You know you want to buy the cards on the rack.

1363
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,880
You know you want to.

1364
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,500
Just a horribly small predatory business.

1365
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,200
It's not predatory!

1366
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:31,060
I don't know where you guys get that idea.

1367
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,080
Alright.

1368
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:35,820
Here we go.

1369
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:36,620
The magic touch.

1370
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,320
The sun is out.

1371
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,180
Look at that.

1372
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:44,540
Look at that.

1373
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,320
Oh!

1374
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:49,360
And another one too.

1375
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:50,800
Look at that.

1376
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:55,640
It's just that easy.

1377
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,560
The sun is out.

1378
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:58,740
My power continues.

1379
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,240
My power continues.

1380
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:02,820
Oh!

1381
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,360
Another one?

1382
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:07,060
Look at that.

1383
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:08,720
I skipped it, but you saw it.

1384
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,020
I skipped it, but you guys saw it.

1385
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:17,900
Praise the sun.

1386
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,200
I know you all saw it.

1387
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,320
It even works on the racks too.

1388
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:24,960
Watch.

1389
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:27,980
Oh!

1390
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,380
Wait!

1391
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:32,820
Oh my God!

1392
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,220
Look at that!

1393
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,380
Six, six, six!

1394
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:37,320
The gold!

1395
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:51,220
I always think the holo cards are at the end because you know how like in Pokemon cards, if you put two cards in the... if you take two cards from the back and put it in the front, um...

1396
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:56,180
So you can have like... you can skip the... what was it?

1397
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,620
You'll know like the...

1398
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,300
You'll know like the holo is at the end.

1399
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:09,220
So I keep thinking that the card is always at the end because I used to watch MaxMofo do like card opening streams.

1400
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:11,840
Or not streams, card opening videos.

1401
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:17,420
And he's always like, let's take two cards from the back and put it in the front and that's like stuck in my head.

1402
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,720
I always think that's how it goes.

1403
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:25,580
Alright.

1404
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:30,840
Oh, look at all these rare cards that I'm gonna sell because I'm a for prop.

1405
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:32,920
This is not a passion, it's...

1406
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,180
This is a for profit store.

1407
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:44,670
What a great collection that I can sell.

1408
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:50,310
The soulless card shop owner.

1409
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:56,750
Oh nice, he bought that card at episode two.

1410
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:58,890
Alright, here we go.

1411
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:02,870
For profit but still owes rent.

1412
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:04,610
Alright, nice.

1413
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:05,630
Let's see.

1414
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:07,410
Nine dollars.

1415
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:08,630
Let's go.

1416
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:09,990
I got achievement!

1417
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:11,310
What did I get?

1418
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:14,190
Thirty-four.

1419
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:15,310
Okay.

1420
01:00:15,870 --> 01:00:16,690
Let's see.

1421
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:18,910
I need to... I need to...

1422
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:20,130
Oh yeah, I should pay rent now.

1423
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:21,650
There we go.

1424
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:24,810
I'm gonna get another uh...

1425
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:27,310
AutoSend.

1426
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:28,370
Does this even matter?

1427
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:30,090
Small warehouse.

1428
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:32,430
Oh yeah, I need to save up for another table.

1429
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:34,770
Let's see.

1430
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:36,150
Yeah, I need to save up.

1431
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:38,050
So the ones in my town.

1432
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:38,310
Yeah.

1433
01:00:39,390 --> 01:00:40,670
Just your locals.

1434
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:43,430
Guys, we're gonna reach a hundred K subscribers!

1435
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:48,010
I'm a not rigged shop owner!

1436
01:00:48,790 --> 01:00:49,430
Wait, no.

1437
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:51,110
Sorry, I have multiple channels.

1438
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:54,250
Cause like, I have multiple channels to try and make it big.

1439
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:54,830
You know?

1440
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:57,050
And I'm...

1441
01:00:58,050 --> 01:01:01,270
So I'm trying to remember which channel was it that's close to a hundred K.

1442
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:02,930
Trying to hit the algorithm.

1443
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:04,170
The grind never stops.

1444
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:08,190
Not rigged TCG shop.

1445
01:01:08,970 --> 01:01:09,850
Expand the shop.

1446
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:12,850
Oh, that's why I needed the cent.

1447
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:14,110
Oh, it's okay.

1448
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:15,150
It's okay.

1449
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:18,350
At least he has the money though.

1450
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:22,950
Now I understand what the cent was for.

1451
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:25,030
Alright, thirty-four.

1452
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:28,290
Okay, we're almost to four hundred dollars.

1453
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:30,590
He's not here to play the card game, so we're fine.

1454
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:31,850
We're fine.

1455
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:32,650
Uh-oh, stinky.

1456
01:01:33,010 --> 01:01:36,610
We should have... Now I know why we have the cleanser.

1457
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:38,090
Okay, let's see.

1458
01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:40,010
Uh, accessories.

1459
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:41,630
Cleanser.

1460
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:43,310
Purchase to unlock.

1461
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:46,170
What is this for?

1462
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:48,010
Is this actually for like...

1463
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:51,610
Is this to clean the cards or clean themselves?

1464
01:01:56,010 --> 01:01:57,070
I can't tell.

1465
01:01:57,190 --> 01:01:58,010
I'll just put it here.

1466
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:04,310
The game or a... I can't tell.

1467
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:04,870
Is it...

1468
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:08,370
Is it to clean the cards or clean the people?

1469
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:10,410
I don't know.

1470
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:13,630
I can't tell which is which.

1471
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:14,610
Like...

1472
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:18,370
Oh, can I actually take the item?

1473
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:20,350
Oh, I can!

1474
01:02:27,850 --> 01:02:29,530
Just in case.

1475
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:30,330
Just in case.

1476
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:32,670
Just in case.

1477
01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:38,730
Oh, I actually... Okay, but what if people buy it, though?

1478
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:41,230
What if people buy it?

1479
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:42,030
You don't know that.

1480
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:44,370
Maybe they'll actually buy it.

1481
01:02:45,050 --> 01:02:46,850
Oh, I need more cards.

1482
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:48,850
Um...

1483
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:52,470
Do you wear in the card shop?

1484
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:55,010
Anyway, guys.

1485
01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:57,470
I'm having a special promotion right now.

1486
01:02:57,670 --> 01:02:59,210
Um, I made a short...

1487
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:00,730
A YouTube short.

1488
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:05,670
It's TCG Shop Owner Underscore 100%.

1489
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:12,630
Um, and to celebrate 100k subscribers, one lucky person Um...

1490
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:18,230
One lucky person will get a free pack for only 10.99.

1491
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:21,170
But just one.

1492
01:03:23,390 --> 01:03:25,630
Also, the sun is out, so we all know what that means.

1493
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:28,770
Hashtag add.

1494
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:37,110
Wait a minute.

1495
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:38,910
Wait a minute.

1496
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:40,550
The sun is out.

1497
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:41,190
No.

1498
01:03:41,390 --> 01:03:42,530
What's going on?

1499
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:44,190
The sun is out.

1500
01:03:45,350 --> 01:03:45,990
Wait.

1501
01:03:46,170 --> 01:03:47,430
What's going on?

1502
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:49,670
What's going on?

1503
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:51,830
The sun is out, though!

1504
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:52,970
The sun...

1505
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:56,630
Is the sun setting?

1506
01:03:57,310 --> 01:03:58,230
Maybe I...

1507
01:03:58,230 --> 01:03:59,770
Maybe I have to go out.

1508
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:03,110
Maybe I need to absorb the sun a little bit longer.

1509
01:04:05,090 --> 01:04:06,570
Maybe... What's happening?

1510
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:07,830
What's happening?

1511
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:09,930
What's happening?

1512
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:15,570
Oh!

1513
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:16,790
It's alright.

1514
01:04:17,030 --> 01:04:17,470
It's alright.

1515
01:04:18,350 --> 01:04:19,450
No, no, no, no.

1516
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:27,630
Because I have the rack, my luck, my power transferred over only to the...

1517
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:29,450
only to the rack cards.

1518
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:31,250
So, that's what's happened.

1519
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:31,610
That's...

1520
01:04:31,610 --> 01:04:32,390
OH MY GOD!

1521
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:35,190
I GOT A GOLD EDITION ANGEL FISH!

1522
01:04:35,410 --> 01:04:36,450
We're so back.

1523
01:04:36,570 --> 01:04:37,270
I told you.

1524
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:37,690
We're so...

1525
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:38,050
Oh, hey, look.

1526
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:38,910
They bought... Look.

1527
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:39,110
See?

1528
01:04:39,490 --> 01:04:40,830
She bought the spray.

1529
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:46,050
She bought the spray to play...

1530
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:47,270
Oh, that's fucked.

1531
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:48,290
That's...

1532
01:04:48,290 --> 01:04:52,610
She bought the spray and took it to her table.

1533
01:04:52,810 --> 01:04:53,730
She knows.

1534
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:54,550
She knows what's up.

1535
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:57,050
She knows what's up.

1536
01:04:57,990 --> 01:04:59,390
The spray.

1537
01:05:00,290 --> 01:05:02,430
Guys, I told you.

1538
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:03,610
It's because...

1539
01:05:03,610 --> 01:05:07,390
It's because my power transferred over to the...

1540
01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:08,050
Look at that.

1541
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:10,210
Look at that.

1542
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:12,870
Look at that.

1543
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:16,850
The disrespect.

1544
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:20,430
This isn't her first rodeo.

1545
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:24,970
She was like, I don't know how to play this guy.

1546
01:05:25,310 --> 01:05:29,270
I'll take two of your... I like how she bought two of the spray cans too.

1547
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:31,830
Not just one, but two of them.

1548
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:33,830
She's in it for the long haul.

1549
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:36,170
Actually, thank you for the super chat.

1550
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:36,530
Thank you.

1551
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:37,130
Thank you.

1552
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:40,250
How much is that secret rare Doki Bird card in the window?

1553
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:42,730
I bought the entire stock.

1554
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:44,570
Thank you for the super chat.

1555
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:45,050
Thank you.

1556
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:45,650
Thank you.

1557
01:05:45,930 --> 01:05:49,070
Um, Austin, thank you for your third super chat.

1558
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:49,750
Thank you.

1559
01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:50,450
Thank you.

1560
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:53,250
Abusing customers is wild.

1561
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:56,570
Guys, they read the fine print.

1562
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:57,470
They came back.

1563
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:59,110
They could have left.

1564
01:05:59,310 --> 01:06:02,150
You know, you know this is what they wanted.

1565
01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:10,330
I'm not the only TCG shop owner in this town.

1566
01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:12,730
Like, maybe I am.

1567
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:14,870
Maybe the other stores went bankrupt during COVID.

1568
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:16,370
But, but...

1569
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,140
Wait, maybe I am, guys.

1570
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:24,320
I think I am.

1571
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:28,900
I think the other I think the other stores went bankrupt after COVID.

1572
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:31,380
So, I am all they have left.

1573
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:43,700
I am the only crazy person that's willing to open a TCG store while there's online shops of cards where they can just buy from GameStop.

1574
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:45,920
Let's see.

1575
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:46,480
$12.

1576
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:47,340
Nice.

1577
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:50,520
It's a monopoly.

1578
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:52,800
Yay!

1579
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:53,800
...

1580
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:57,660
Abusing a monopoly.

1581
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:03,040
I'm the only one crazy enough to open a Tetra...

1582
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:07,700
a Tetramon exclusive shop too.

1583
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:09,400
I don't sell any other card games.

1584
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:17,760
If you're gonna come here to buy Yu-Gi-Oh cards or Pokemon cards or Magic the Gathering cards, fucking leave my store.

1585
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:20,660
You can only play Tetramon only.

1586
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:24,120
I have an exclusive contract with Tetramon.

1587
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:29,740
In this entire country of Canada, this is the only place you can buy Tetramon cards.

1588
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:34,840
You have...

1589
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:38,620
I don't care if you live in Winnipeg or something.

1590
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,000
You gotta travel all the way down...

1591
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:41,360
Oh god.

1592
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:42,000
Oh god.

1593
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:42,480
Oh god.

1594
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:43,300
I see...

1595
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:44,000
Oh god.

1596
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:50,060
Okay.

1597
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,060
Sorry.

1598
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:53,760
Anyway, back to my monologue.

1599
01:07:53,980 --> 01:08:00,060
In the entire country of Canada, you have to travel down here!

1600
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:02,460
In an undisclosed location!

1601
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:04,380
Because I don't want to dox myself.

1602
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:09,120
Just for Tetramon cards!

1603
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,780
Oh, he came in there with his friend.

1604
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:13,820
He knows what's up.

1605
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:17,940
That's wild.

1606
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:22,620
That's wild.

1607
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:24,260
That's wild.

1608
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:24,920
That's wild.

1609
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:31,320
Somewhere in the west coast, this is where the only place you can buy Tetramon cards.

1610
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:34,180
Alright.

1611
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:36,320
I think I need more deodorant.

1612
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:37,000
I think.

1613
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:40,980
Bankrupt equals doki showed up overnight with a bat.

1614
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,800
Thank you for the super chat.

1615
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:43,280
Thank you.

1616
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:44,100
Thank you.

1617
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,000
Alright, we actually...

1618
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,360
We need more... Oh shit!

1619
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:48,460
Rare card pack!

1620
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:50,520
Wait, I want that.

1621
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,420
Do I buy... Okay, but deodorant...

1622
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:53,420
Oh...

1623
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:58,000
Deodorant was making so much money though.

1624
01:08:58,260 --> 01:08:59,380
Okay, let's...

1625
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,400
Okay, we need $300.

1626
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:02,260
That's fine.

1627
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,360
Why is it taking so long to make money?

1628
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:13,360
Guys, where did you hear about this light situation?

1629
01:09:13,740 --> 01:09:14,860
There's no lights here.

1630
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:17,620
I don't know.

1631
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:21,580
I have no idea where you get the idea that we have lights, guys.

1632
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:27,060
I purposely made sure this store was environmentally friendly.

1633
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:29,140
So I took out all the lights.

1634
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,040
Alright, let's see.

1635
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:34,540
No, I can't.

1636
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:34,980
I cannot.

1637
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:36,340
The sun's not out.

1638
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,120
Resist the temptation, doki.

1639
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:40,040
Resist the temptation.

1640
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:40,580
Resist the temptation.

1641
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:44,780
Your friend's not coming.

1642
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:46,580
Your friend's not coming.

1643
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:47,540
It's time to leave.

1644
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:48,700
Sir.

1645
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:52,800
Wait, isn't that the guy sprayed?

1646
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:54,320
No, that's not him.

1647
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:56,040
Alright, guys.

1648
01:09:57,580 --> 01:09:58,580
Come on, guys.

1649
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:01,060
Can't keep playing card games in here.

1650
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,220
The store is closed, guys.

1651
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,020
No loitering, guys.

1652
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:07,060
No loitering.

1653
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:08,780
Guys!

1654
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:09,580
Come on!

1655
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,940
If you're not gonna pay, you gotta leave.

1656
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,880
Don't do that.

1657
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:15,820
Spray them away.

1658
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:19,060
Guys, no loitering!

1659
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:19,960
Guys!

1660
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:21,620
Go!

1661
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:24,180
Wait!

1662
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:25,600
Leave!

1663
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:28,240
Leave!

1664
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,120
It's okay.

1665
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:35,600
I can still sell this.

1666
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:36,780
It's fine.

1667
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:39,540
Wait, I can?

1668
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:40,580
Oh, I can.

1669
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:41,320
Thank God.

1670
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:41,640
Alright.

1671
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,400
If you're gonna be here, I'm still gonna close the store.

1672
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:49,340
Nice!

1673
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,180
I made profit!

1674
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,000
Let's go!

1675
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:55,420
Alright.

1676
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:57,500
You just need one...

Oh, hey!

1678
01:10:57,940 --> 01:10:59,780
Okay, we just need to sell this card.

1679
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:01,920
Uh...

1680
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,360
Seven dollars...

1681
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:04,800
Six dollars?

1682
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:05,480
Yeah.

1683
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:06,640
That's fine.

1684
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:08,440
Oh, come in, come in, guys!

We're open now, for real.

1688
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:22,660
Now we're actually open.

1689
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:27,400
Alright.

1690
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:31,180
Use the Axe Spray to spray them away.

1691
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,360
Hey there, girl.

1692
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,020

Oh, wait, there's the trash can.

1697
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,360
Oh, you got the rack.

1698
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:44,040
It's working.

1699
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,780
The rack is working.

1700
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,360
Oh, this is fine?

1701
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:48,740
Nice.

1704
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:52,880
Okay, nice.

1705
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,080
Alright, what did you buy?

1706
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:58,300
Oh, the Golden Nimbus card?

1707
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:00,140
Yeah, I heard that card is fine.

1708
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:03,280
Thirteen dollars.

1709
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:04,040
Let's go.

1710
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:05,740
Alright, maybe I can afford...

1711
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:06,480
Oh, I can afford it!

1712
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:08,580

Oh, I can afford the rare card packs now!

1715
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:23,560
Okay, when can I afford, like, a kid to work for me?

1716
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,340
Level ten?

1717
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:26,720
I'm only level five?

1718
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:29,040
This is gonna take fucking forever!

1719
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:34,760
Okay, nine dollars.

1720
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:37,080
Wait, I think he also bought another card.

1721
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:39,560
Okay, let's see.

01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:49,360
Oh my god, I've been going in there for a while now.

1726
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:54,200
Alright, let's put the rare cards.

1727
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:56,440
Oh, I forgot about the booster pack shit!

1728
01:12:57,420 --> 01:12:58,460
That makes sense.

1729
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:00,600
Chuck that in here.

1730
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:03,460
Okay, how much is market price?

1731
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:05,120
Five dollars now.

1732
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:09,120
Alright, if I need to buy, like, the booster pack shit.

1733
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:11,100
Guys, please, can I spend some money?

1734
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:12,280
Guys?

1735
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:13,920
Oh, wait!

1736
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:15,620
You're right.

1737
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:17,060
It's time.

1738
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,820
What is this fucking rare card bullshit?

1739
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:27,260
What is this?

1740
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:29,640
Get back in the box.

1741
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:32,340
Get back in the box.

1742
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:35,220
You gotta go on the rack.

1743
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:36,300
You gotta

1744
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:41,580
Yeah, go in the rack.

1745
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,280
There we go.

1746
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:50,240
This time it'll be different.

1747
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:52,120
Wait.

1748
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:53,640
Okay.

1749
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:57,700
What's going on?

1750
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:58,600
This is a scam.

1751
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,260
What the fuck is going on?

1752
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:02,580
Maybe it's cause I didn't open it in the sun.

1753
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:03,920
Maybe that's it.

1754
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:07,880
The punishment rack.

1755
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:10,220
What is going on?

1756
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:13,500
Did my fucking distributor scam me?

1757
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:15,440
Oh my god.

1758
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:16,940
My distributor weighed the packs.

1759
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:18,840
He fucking weighed the packs.

1760
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:21,300
Her streak is over.

1761
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:23,580
Oh my god.

1762
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:27,960
I got I bought this box.

1763
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:30,460
I bought that box from eBay.

1764
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:31,460
I fucked up.

1765
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:35,020
I bought the box from eBay guys and they weighed the pack.

1766
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,360
Oh damn.

1767
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:36,960
Okay.

1768
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:39,720
Okay guys.

1769
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:41,960
To be fair, this pack was more lucky though.

1770
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:44,880
No!

1771
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:46,740
Oh!

1772
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:47,900
It's okay.

1773
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:49,780
Oh!

1774
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:50,620
The ball!

1775
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:52,300
It's cause I didn't get the heart.

1776
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:53,680
It made up for it.

1777
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:55,520
Look at that.

1778
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:57,480
Look at that.

1779
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:58,920
Not punished.

1780
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:03,300
They They resealed the pack.

1781
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:08,620
I got two to make up for the duds.

1782
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:10,520
That's fine.

1783
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:12,520
It made up for it.

1784
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:15,120
It evens out.

1785
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:16,020
It's okay.

1786
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:18,100
Everything evened out in the end.

1787
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:19,120
Wait.

1788
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:19,940
Too much.

1789
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:20,700
Oh thank god.

1790
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:22,980
Thank god it stopped me.

1791
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:25,620
Alright.

1792
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:26,220
What was this?

1793
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:27,800
$7.

1794
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:28,800
There we go.

1795
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:29,560
Yeah.

1796
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:31,780
99% This is why I didn't quit.

1797
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,800
I didn't quit opening packs chat.

1798
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:37,480
99% of gamblers quit before they make it big.

1799
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:38,100
Exactly.

1800
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,600
And I never stopped.

1801
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:42,180
I knew my luck was gonna change today.

1802
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:43,000
Alright.

1803
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:47,140
We're so back.

1804
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:48,800
Alright.

1805
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:50,260
Oh shit.

1806
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:52,560
They actually bought my used cans.

1807
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:56,600
First edition.

1808
01:15:57,460 --> 01:15:58,540
Silver edition.

1809
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:01,340
Easy.

1810
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,420
They didn't get all of them.

1811
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:07,720
They didn't reseal all of them.

1812
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:12,540
Guys I need $400 so I can buy another card.

1813
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:13,080
Dang.

1814
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:19,600
8.50 50 cents.

1815
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:21,920
This is the first time I have to use coins there.

1816
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,400
Let's go gambling.

1817
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:25,900
Oh dang it.

1818
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:28,040
Maybe if I stop opening cards.

1819
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,380
I can actually make money.

1820
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:34,400
Maybe.

1821
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:41,440
It could be a possibility but I gotta think about it chat.

1822
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:44,140
I have to think about it a bit longer.

1823
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:50,800
That sounds like a gambler quitting.

1824
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:53,860
I'm just I'm thinking about it.

1825
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:55,460
It doesn't mean I'm committing to it.

1826
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:57,660
I'm just thinking about it.

1827
01:16:58,100 --> 01:16:58,540
Yeah.

1828
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:00,060
What a thought.

1829
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:02,560
Oh he bought a card as well.

1830
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:04,620
Nice.

1831
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:06,360
Okay I should put more cards in here.

1832
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:08,700
Uh...

1833
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:10,540
$8.

1834
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:12,760
And then...

1835
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:13,860
What's this?

1836
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:15,720
$8.

1837
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:18,560
And then what should I put here?

1838
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:19,080
This guy.

1839
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:20,960
The...

1840
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:22,340
Decimite.

1841
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:24,580
I wish I could actually play these card games.

1842
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:26,860
I think that would be fun too.

1843
01:17:27,660 --> 01:17:29,040
Oh he bought the box.

1844
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,880
He knows that's where the real money is.

1845
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:34,960
He knows I can't weigh those.

1846
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:41,340
This is how a terrifying pretty cardboard addiction starts.

1847
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:43,160
Lolly thank you for the super chat.

1848
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:43,600
Thank you.

1849
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:44,380
Thank you.

1850
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:47,280
Can I open a box?

1851
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:47,760
Let's see.

1852
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:51,620
Oh my god I can.

1853
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:54,040
I can just open all of this.

1854
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:56,580
Oh my god you're right.

1855
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:58,820
You're right.

1856
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,760
Oh my god I could just literally just keep opening.

1857
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:07,240
I know I could have made more money but...

1858
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:08,060
Oh look at that!

1859
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:14,020
Guys I know I could have just made more money if I just sold the entire box.

1860
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:15,360
But this is different.

1861
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:16,300
You don't understand.

1862
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:17,020
Oh!

1863
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:22,260
I should just keep opening boxes.

1864
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:23,760
I should...

1865
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,500
I should...

1866
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:32,100
This is where all my money goes into.

1867
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:35,460
This is it.

1868
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:37,380
Oh my god there was a holo!

1869
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:43,140
Guys I get holos so many times that like it's not even special to me anymore.

1870
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:49,380
It's not even that special anymore.

1871
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:50,820
I'm just like oh.

1872
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:52,280
Another one?

1873
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:52,800
Wow.

1874
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,680
Cause it's guaranteed every time in my store.

1875
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:59,120
It's always guaranteed in my store so...

1876
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:03,770
Oh look at that!

1877
01:19:04,230 --> 01:19:05,910
Look at that!

1878
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:07,210
That's it.

1879
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:09,230
She's beyond saving.

1880
01:19:12,850 --> 01:19:16,450
And I literally just made back my money.

1881
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:17,950
Right there.

1882
01:19:18,590 --> 01:19:21,230
Literally just made back everything.

1883
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:22,490
Alright.

1884
01:19:22,630 --> 01:19:24,750
A hundred and twenty and three.

1885
01:19:25,630 --> 01:19:29,590
Oh maybe like actually what's like the ten percent markup for this?

1886
01:19:30,610 --> 01:19:32,210
Oh a hundred and thirty?

1887
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:33,250
Let's do it.

1888
01:19:33,390 --> 01:19:35,090
We'll put a hundred and thirty here.

1889
01:19:36,130 --> 01:19:38,610
And then we'll put this here.

1890
01:19:39,670 --> 01:19:41,090
And this here.

1891
01:19:42,190 --> 01:19:44,070
We've lost it.

1892
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:51,030
Guys if I keep opening why would I sell these when I can just open them?

1893
01:19:51,290 --> 01:19:51,730
Like why?

1894
01:19:54,350 --> 01:19:56,450
Guys I'm so stupid.

1895
01:19:56,610 --> 01:19:58,570
This is the real money maker.

1896
01:19:58,870 --> 01:20:02,850
Why would I Why would I sell the boxes?

1897
01:20:03,010 --> 01:20:07,190
When I can make back all my money opening the boxes chat.

1898
01:20:07,450 --> 01:20:08,370
Look at that.

1899
01:20:09,110 --> 01:20:09,910
Come on.

1900
01:20:09,970 --> 01:20:10,390
Come on.

1901
01:20:10,430 --> 01:20:11,590
There has to be another rare.

1902
01:20:12,270 --> 01:20:13,230
Please stop.

1903
01:20:13,390 --> 01:20:14,730
Toki no you gotta stop.

1904
01:20:15,030 --> 01:20:17,190
The sun is coming out Toki.

1905
01:20:17,230 --> 01:20:18,750
The sun is setting.

1906
01:20:18,950 --> 01:20:20,030
You have to stop.

1907
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:21,110
No.

1908
01:20:21,130 --> 01:20:21,530
No.

1909
01:20:21,730 --> 01:20:22,470
There has to be.

1910
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:23,070
No.

1911
01:20:23,130 --> 01:20:23,330
No.

1912
01:20:23,330 --> 01:20:23,930
My magic.

1913
01:20:23,990 --> 01:20:25,950
I stored up the magic here.

1914
01:20:26,950 --> 01:20:28,770
There has to be another one.

1915
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:30,850
There has to be another rare.

1916
01:20:34,770 --> 01:20:37,750
She has stopped pretending to realize.

1917
01:20:38,390 --> 01:20:38,870
No.

1918
01:20:38,930 --> 01:20:40,690
It has to be the last pack.

1919
01:20:40,930 --> 01:20:42,170
It's the last pack.

1920
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:43,430
It has to be.

1921
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:44,690
Oh no.

1922
01:20:44,850 --> 01:20:45,530
Oh no.

1923
01:20:45,670 --> 01:20:45,970
No.

1924
01:20:46,010 --> 01:20:47,190
Is it because of the sun?

1925
01:20:47,390 --> 01:20:47,830
No.

1926
01:20:47,870 --> 01:20:48,150
Okay.

1927
01:20:48,290 --> 01:20:49,050
Another sun.

1928
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:50,670
I got like some stuff.

1929
01:20:51,730 --> 01:20:53,410
We lost her.

1930
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:55,990
It's okay.

1931
01:20:55,990 --> 01:20:57,310
It's because the sun is going down.

1932
01:20:57,450 --> 01:20:59,390
It's because the sun is going down.

1933
01:20:59,470 --> 01:21:01,110
That's the only reason chat.

1934
01:21:01,370 --> 01:21:08,350
That's the only reason the sun went down.

1935
01:21:08,410 --> 01:21:09,770
So it's okay.

1936
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:10,650
It's okay.

1937
01:21:10,770 --> 01:21:14,330
The moment we hit the next morning it'll be okay.

1938
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:16,590
It'll be okay.

1939
01:21:17,730 --> 01:21:19,070
What card did you get?

1940
01:21:19,070 --> 01:21:21,870
Oh, you got the EX Wurmple.

1941
01:21:23,870 --> 01:21:24,430
$11.

1942
01:21:24,610 --> 01:21:25,170
Nice.

1943
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:27,570
Donkey Bird Gambling Fun.

1944
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:29,690
Sir, thank you for the super chat.

1945
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:30,150
Thank you.

1946
01:21:30,190 --> 01:21:30,790
Thank you.

1947
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:32,990
It's okay.

1948
01:21:33,110 --> 01:21:34,750
This is the card opening stream.

1949
01:21:35,050 --> 01:21:38,030
You know how all these other Vtubers do card opening stream?

1950
01:21:38,190 --> 01:21:41,150
I do it too but virtually because I'm more immersive.

1951
01:21:44,510 --> 01:21:47,210
I'm here to give you the immersion guys.

1952
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:49,210
I'm here to give you the immersion.

1953
01:21:49,210 --> 01:21:49,730
Guys, okay, wait.

1954
01:21:52,150 --> 01:21:52,590
$4.

1955
01:21:52,890 --> 01:21:55,890
So we'll put that as market price.

1956
01:21:56,070 --> 01:21:56,410
Okay.

1957
01:21:58,050 --> 01:22:00,250
So I'll put it at $6 then.

1958
01:22:00,550 --> 01:22:10,490
Guys, I know the sun is out but guys, all I'm saying is that I know the sun is out but I have stored some magic inside me.

1959
01:22:11,530 --> 01:22:12,330
There's no way.

1960
01:22:12,530 --> 01:22:14,550
I literally stored the magic.

1961
01:22:15,290 --> 01:22:15,870
Wait, wait.

1962
01:22:15,970 --> 01:22:16,850
That was a hook.

1963
01:22:16,930 --> 01:22:17,810
I stored some magic.

1964
01:22:19,070 --> 01:22:19,230
There's a hollow.

1965
01:22:19,550 --> 01:22:21,270
There has to be another rare.

1966
01:22:26,790 --> 01:22:28,010
Did you see that?

1967
01:22:28,010 --> 01:22:28,510
That's a hollow.

1968
01:22:29,690 --> 01:22:32,050
Even hollows don't give me that excited.

1969
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:32,350
No.

1970
01:22:32,590 --> 01:22:35,970
Even hollows don't even give me excited anymore.

1971
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:40,970
Ever since I got that $100 card, I'm chasing that high.

1972
01:22:41,910 --> 01:22:46,690
I need that high again.

1973
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:49,310
I need that $100 high!

1974
01:22:50,510 --> 01:22:52,710
She's building a tolerance.

1975
01:22:53,870 --> 01:22:54,430
Oh!

1976
01:22:54,430 --> 01:22:56,470
But that's not even $100!

1977
01:22:59,090 --> 01:23:00,030
Oh my god.

1978
01:23:00,070 --> 01:23:00,550
Come on.

1979
01:23:00,590 --> 01:23:01,870
There has to be a hundred.

1980
01:23:01,970 --> 01:23:02,930
Where is it?

1981
01:23:03,010 --> 01:23:03,890
Where is it?

1982
01:23:03,890 --> 01:23:05,530
There has to be another one.

1983
01:23:05,810 --> 01:23:09,890
I just want to get the $1k card.

1984
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:17,290
She's in too deep now.

1985
01:23:20,430 --> 01:23:22,110
You guys don't understand.

1986
01:23:22,470 --> 01:23:23,970
You don't understand.

1987
01:23:24,010 --> 01:23:26,990
When you get that jackpot, you can't stop.

1988
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:29,430
You just want to get that card again.

1989
01:23:29,570 --> 01:23:31,170
You want to know how that feels.

1990
01:23:32,330 --> 01:23:36,130
It was just such a good feeling and you want to chase it.

1991
01:23:36,290 --> 01:23:37,750
You want to feel that.

1992
01:23:38,070 --> 01:23:40,850
You want to feel that energy again.

1993
01:23:40,870 --> 01:23:43,270
That excitement again.

1994
01:23:43,450 --> 01:23:46,130
You got to chase it until you can feel it again.

1995
01:23:48,270 --> 01:23:49,150
Come on.

1996
01:23:49,170 --> 01:23:50,190
Thank you for the super chat.

1997
01:23:50,270 --> 01:23:50,610
Thank you.

1998
01:23:50,630 --> 01:23:51,290
Thank you.

1999
01:23:51,690 --> 01:23:53,610
Maybe try putting them in boxes.

2000
01:23:54,150 --> 01:23:54,790
You're right.

2001
01:23:54,910 --> 01:23:56,890
Maybe the rack will bring me good luck.

2002
01:23:57,090 --> 01:23:57,770
Oh my god.

2003
01:23:57,790 --> 01:23:58,610
You're so right.

2004
01:23:58,830 --> 01:23:59,890
You're so right.

2005
01:23:59,970 --> 01:24:01,470
Maybe I'll just put it down here.

2006
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:04,770
If I put it down here and let it absorb the sun magic.

2007
01:24:05,390 --> 01:24:05,830
Maybe.

2008
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:08,370
I'll just let it absorb the sun magic.

2009
01:24:08,450 --> 01:24:09,890
Like absorb it all up.

2010
01:24:11,990 --> 01:24:14,590
And then maybe it's time.

2011
01:24:15,230 --> 01:24:15,870
Get out.

2012
01:24:17,170 --> 01:24:17,910
Get out.

2013
01:24:18,110 --> 01:24:20,090
I need the sun to come out.

2014
01:24:20,190 --> 01:24:20,990
I need you to leave.

2015
01:24:24,430 --> 01:24:27,310
I need you to leave so I can have the sun.

2016
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:31,230
No!

2017
01:24:31,370 --> 01:24:32,670
He bought two boxes!

2018
01:24:32,990 --> 01:24:33,430
Money!

2019
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:39,700
No!

2020
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:47,560
He knew.

2021
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:48,380
No!

2022
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:50,260
I'm saving up for that!

2023
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:51,680
Okay.

2024
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:56,840
I need to buy another card display.

2025
01:24:57,140 --> 01:24:57,900
A card table.

2026
01:24:58,060 --> 01:24:58,260
Yeah.

2027
01:24:58,440 --> 01:24:59,820
This is what I was saving for.

2028
01:25:00,940 --> 01:25:02,880
So I can sell more of my cards.

2029
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:04,960
Okay.

2030
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:05,380
There.

2031
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:06,720
You have to look at it now.

2032
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:09,580
Okay.

2033
01:25:09,580 --> 01:25:10,140
I'll put it here.

2034
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:13,580
Put all of them here.

2035
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,920
I'll make back my money through the individual cards.

2036
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:17,700
Oh.

2037
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:21,640
I'll make it all back.

2038
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:22,640
I can feel it.

2039
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:26,280
I can feel myself making it all back.

2040
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:28,740
I'll pay my bill soon.

2041
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:29,720
I swear to God.

2042
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:32,260
I'll pay it soon.

2043
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:32,880
I swear.

2044
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:35,080
Okay.

2045
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:37,060
And then this should be $4.

2046
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,320
This should be also $4.

2047
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:43,360
Okay.

2048
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:46,620
And then $5.

2049
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:47,940
Uh...

2050
01:25:48,590 --> 01:25:48,840
$5.

2051
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:52,380
This one also should be...

2052
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:52,760
Wait.

2053
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:53,540
Did I just...

2054
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:54,620
$5.

2055
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:55,300
Here we go.

2056
01:25:55,580 --> 01:25:58,040
And this one will be $5.

2057
01:25:58,640 --> 01:25:59,420
There we go.

2058
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:01,980
Alright.

2059
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:03,640
We're open.

2060
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:04,600
Oh, my bills.

2061
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:06,520
It's okay.

2062
01:26:06,580 --> 01:26:07,240
I have six days.

2063
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:08,200
I don't have to worry.

2064
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:08,960
It's time.

2065
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:11,460
Hi.

2066
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:13,480
It's time.

2067
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:14,340
This is it.

2068
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:16,600
That cost $5.

2069
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:17,260
$5.

2070
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:19,980
Fucking leave.

2071
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:21,940
You don't appreciate true value.

2072
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:24,360
This has been on my YouTube channel.

2073
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:25,760
Alright.

2074
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:28,360
That's not...

2075
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:29,120
That's not it.

2076
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:30,740
It's not the same.

2077
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:33,460
The sparkles don't...

2078
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:34,800
Oh, my God.

2079
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:36,180
Oh, it's $11.

2080
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:37,840
It's not the same.

2081
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,000
It's not the same.

2082
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:41,420
It's just a one second excitement.

2083
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:42,860
One second high.

2084
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:45,540
It doesn't capture that moment.

2085
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:48,900
That's what I did when I opened that $100 card.

2086
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:49,900
It's...

2087
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:54,140
It only lasted one second.

2088
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:55,320
I need that.

2089
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:56,660
I need that $100.

2090
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:58,800
I need that five second high.

2091
01:26:59,060 --> 01:26:59,640
I need...

2092
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:06,760
I need at least five seconds to be satisfied.

2093
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:12,480
Come on.

2094
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:14,880
I need to see high numbers.

2095
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:15,340
No!

2096
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:17,060
It's okay.

2097
01:27:17,180 --> 01:27:21,140
If they keep spending money, I'll be able to afford another box.

2098
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:22,600
Guys, please.

2099
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:23,820
Please spend money.

2100
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:25,600
I need to afford boxes.

2101
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:26,740
Guys.

2102
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:31,520
Guys, please.

2103
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:32,780
Please.

2104
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:34,640
I need you guys.

2105
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:37,160
I need you guys to spend...

2106
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:39,060
Spend those boxes.

2107
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,660
I need to buy boxes.

2108
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:43,300
Please.

2109
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:43,920
Please.

2110
01:27:44,970 --> 01:27:46,300
Okay, guys.

2111
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:47,040
I'll move.

2112
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:50,280
I'll let you see the money.

2113
01:27:50,980 --> 01:27:51,680
Bye.

2114
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:57,960
Are you satisfied?

2115
01:27:58,220 --> 01:28:00,640
Now I'm on the left side.

2116
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:02,900
It's so weird to be on the left side.

2117
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:03,380
Chat.

2118
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:07,860
It's so weird to be on the left side.

2119
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:10,260
It's so weird to be on the left side.

2120
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:13,120
You buy individual packs?

2121
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:15,820
Don't you know the money is where...

2122
01:28:15,820 --> 01:28:19,340
Don't you know the money is where...

2123
01:28:19,340 --> 01:28:19,860
Don't you know the money is where...

2124
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:21,600
Where the boxes are?

2125
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:24,260
Are you doing this for passion?

2126
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:26,260
Are you doing this for passion?

2127
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:33,580
I can't believe it.

2128
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:38,860
This feels so wrong.

2129
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:39,740
It does.

2130
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:40,900
It feels so wrong.

2131
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:43,660
I feel so out of place being on the side.

2132
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:45,220
I feel so out of place being on the side.

2133
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:45,840
Okay.

2134
01:28:46,540 --> 01:28:47,660
Let's see boxes.

2135
01:28:48,220 --> 01:28:49,380
Eight boxes.

2136
01:28:49,660 --> 01:28:51,940
Guys, please.

2137
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:54,940
Leave so I can leave.

2138
01:28:55,260 --> 01:28:55,940
$14.

2139
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:57,380
It's almost there.

2140
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:00,320
Where are you looking at?

2141
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:00,980
There's nothing there.

2142
01:29:03,580 --> 01:29:03,940
There's nothing there.

2143
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:10,720
What are you even looking at?

2144
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:11,460
Oh, buy those cards.

2145
01:29:11,620 --> 01:29:12,520
Come on, I just need...

2146
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:14,060
I need $14.

2147
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:16,880
Why are you loitering back to the empty box?

2148
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:18,560
No, don't leave.

2149
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:20,700
I need $14.

2150
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,840
Making some money isn't enough.

2151
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:26,340
You need to make all the money.

2152
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:27,780
Thank you for the super chat.

2153
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:28,660
Thank you.

2154
01:29:29,380 --> 01:29:31,700
Okay, $6.

2155
01:29:33,580 --> 01:29:34,660
We're almost there.

2156
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:36,820
Oh, nice.

2157
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,100
He bought a card.

2158
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:40,400
He almost gave him change.

2159
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:42,280
Where's that card coming from?

2160
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:42,840
Right here.

2161
01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:43,200
Okay.

2162
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:46,700
That should be $14.

2163
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:48,060
Oh, yeah.

2164
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:48,860
$14.

2165
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:49,400
There we go.

2166
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:52,760
Thank you for your very first super chat.

2167
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:53,100
Thank you.

2168
01:29:53,140 --> 01:29:55,940
I just bought three boxes of one piece.

2169
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,100
Let's go broke together.

2170
01:29:57,480 --> 01:29:58,960
Thank you for the super chat.

2171
01:29:58,960 --> 01:29:59,440
Thank you.

2172
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,080
I heard that...

2173
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:05,180
Wait, what boxes has a...

2174
01:30:05,660 --> 01:30:07,740
One of the boxes has a box?

2175
01:30:08,620 --> 01:30:09,640
Which one is it?

2176
01:30:10,580 --> 01:30:11,680
Which one is it?

2177
01:30:13,420 --> 01:30:14,560
Which one is it?

2178
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:15,420
Is it this one?

2179
01:30:17,380 --> 01:30:17,860
No.

2180
01:30:19,300 --> 01:30:20,260
Oh my god.

2181
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:22,480
Alright, I can't find it.

2182
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:23,620
I can't be bothered.

2183
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:25,740
I can't be bothered.

2184
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:27,160
Oh, it is.

2185
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:30,140
I am a true believer of the Singapore.

2186
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:36,140
Okay.

2187
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:40,980
The boxes was what where my luck was.

2188
01:30:41,620 --> 01:30:42,180
Wait.

2189
01:30:42,620 --> 01:30:43,880
Did I actually put two?

2190
01:30:44,180 --> 01:30:46,120
Okay, we can only afford one.

2191
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:48,220
We're not made of money right now.

2192
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:49,760
This is it.

2193
01:30:50,300 --> 01:30:52,420
Nobody can get my boxes.

2194
01:30:52,420 --> 01:30:53,340
I'm putting it here.

2195
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:55,580
No one can buy my boxes.

2196
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:58,860
Nobody can buy my boxes.

2197
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:05,560
The boxes is just for me.

2198
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:07,740
It's only for me.

2199
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:14,460
Come on, give me that high again.

2200
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:15,180
I need it.

2201
01:31:15,260 --> 01:31:16,720
I need to feel this.

2202
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:18,460
I need three dollars.

2203
01:31:18,460 --> 01:31:19,360
Come on.

2204
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:21,300
There has to be a bigger...

2205
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:28,100
We're so good.

2206
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:31,200
Yuki, what about the bills?

2207
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:33,420
These cards will pay for my bills.

2208
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:35,280
These cards will pay for my bills.

2209
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:38,200
The hundred dollar card will pay for my bills.

2210
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:41,600
The hundred dollar card will pay for my bills.

2211
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:42,160
The hundred dollar card will pay for my bills.

2212
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:43,960
We've lost her.

2213
01:31:44,060 --> 01:31:45,800
We've lost her chat.

2214
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:48,440
She only did this unironically.

2215
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:50,120
But now she's too gone.

2216
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:51,880
She's too far in.

2217
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:55,040
Opening packs in the street.

2218
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:57,900
Like a sane person.

2219
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:06,860
Azurak, thank you for the super chat.

2220
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,120
Thank you, thank you.

2221
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:08,980
Okay, fine.

2222
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:10,220
I'll do one pack.

2223
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,200
I'll do one more pack.

2224
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:16,380
But if this pack doesn't give me that hundred dollar thrill.

2225
01:32:18,460 --> 01:32:19,080
I'll give you a hundred dollars.

2226
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:20,760
Pathetic.

2227
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:25,260
Told you.

2228
01:32:25,340 --> 01:32:27,180
I told you it's not the same.

2229
01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:28,760
It's not the same.

2230
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:31,440
Not my lovely area right here.

2231
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:35,260
Just one more.

2232
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,180
Just one more.

2233
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:39,880
Come on.

2234
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:44,820
There has to be that hundred dollar.

2235
01:32:45,820 --> 01:32:47,140
Doki- No!

2236
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:51,460
Just one more hit.

2237
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,320
Oh my god.

2238
01:32:54,340 --> 01:32:56,540
They're just stupid hollows.

2239
01:32:57,380 --> 01:32:58,840
It's not the same.

2240
01:32:59,220 --> 01:33:00,720
It's not the same.

2241
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:04,240
I need, I need, I need five digits in there.

2242
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:09,500
Incoming Doki- Dead.

2243
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:13,580
I just...

2244
01:33:13,580 --> 01:33:16,020
I just need to know what it's like again.

2245
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:18,000
I need to know what it's like again.

2246
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:19,560
I need to know.

2247
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,460
I need to know.

2248
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:26,140
The hunt for the ultra rank.

2249
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:28,960
Come on.

2250
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:31,540
He can wait.

2251
01:33:31,700 --> 01:33:33,460
That guy over there can wait.

2252
01:33:33,700 --> 01:33:35,480
Children card for addiction.

2253
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:36,100
Addiction.

2254
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:42,940
0.5 second.

2255
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:50,380
Only 0.5 second of joy.

2256
01:33:50,540 --> 01:33:51,760
It's getting worse chat.

2257
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:53,380
It's getting worse.

2258
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,080
Please stop.

2259
01:33:59,940 --> 01:34:00,680
It's okay.

2260
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:01,840
The next box.

2261
01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:03,460
It has to be the next box.

2262
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:05,880
It's getting shorter.

2263
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:09,460
It's the next box.

2264
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:10,320
I can feel it.

2265
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:11,760
I can feel it.

2266
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:14,360
The next box will bring me pure joy.

2267
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:16,520
Okay, what did he buy?

2268
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:18,680
Okay, one dollar.

2269
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:20,660
Oh, I can pay my bills now.

2270
01:34:20,820 --> 01:34:21,560
Okay, that's good.

2271
01:34:21,660 --> 01:34:22,820
But I can also buy a box.

2272
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:23,860
Okay, wait.

2273
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:24,440
Bills.

2274
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:25,540
I have six days.

2275
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,240
I can buy another box.

2276
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:31,080
Not enough money?

2277
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:33,240
It's 114.

2278
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:33,900
What do you mean?

2279
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:36,540
I need to pay a delivery fee?

2280
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:39,640
Why do you try to fucking deliver me?

2281
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:40,940
It's just cardboard.

2282
01:34:43,460 --> 01:34:47,140
Why do you try to deliver?

2283
01:34:47,260 --> 01:34:48,420
It's fucking cardboard.

2284
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:56,360
These delivery men don't need my five dollars of money.

2285
01:34:56,620 --> 01:34:59,200
You should have pot prived.

2286
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:01,200
Come on.

2287
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:03,720
It's not the same.

2288
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:04,840
It's not the same.

2289
01:35:07,180 --> 01:35:08,240
Where is it?

2290
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:09,480
Where is it?

2291
01:35:10,020 --> 01:35:12,840
It baited me.

2292
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:14,300
It fucking baited me.

2293
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:17,240
It fucking baited me.

2294
01:35:17,260 --> 01:35:19,380
I thought it was true value.

2295
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:25,160
I don't need that card.

2296
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:25,860
It's not.

2297
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:27,700
I don't need that card.

2298
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:28,680
Ten dollars?

2299
01:35:28,780 --> 01:35:29,920
What do you think I am?

2300
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:32,420
A fucking single pack owner?

2301
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:36,240
Okay.

2302
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:37,140
It's okay.

2303
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:44,000
0.0 Come on.

2304
01:35:44,060 --> 01:35:45,120
Where is it?

2305
01:35:47,020 --> 01:35:49,600
Do I like scroll, sort my album?

2306
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:51,580
Price.

2307
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,560
This is my most expensive.

2308
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:58,080
And then, oh I can like look at my pages here.

2309
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:00,020
Oh my god.

2310
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:01,220
I do not have a lot.

2311
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:01,940
.

2312
01:36:01,940 --> 01:36:02,460
.

2313
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:09,580
Did Doki really change when she went to the left side?

2314
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:12,100
I still have so many.

2315
01:36:12,220 --> 01:36:12,940
It's okay.

2316
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:14,840
I still have so many.

2317
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:17,220
Eventually.

2318
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:21,260
I'll eventually get that pack again.

2319
01:36:22,540 --> 01:36:24,300
I'll eventually get it.

2320
01:36:24,340 --> 01:36:25,080
Nine dollars?

2321
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:28,080
Talk to me when you add two more zeros at the end.

2322
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:33,940
I want the right side Doki back.

2323
01:36:34,300 --> 01:36:41,580
On the right side Doki at least actually let the customers buy the cards.

2324
01:36:42,020 --> 01:36:44,660
Doki you're not even selling cards.

2325
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:46,100
It doesn't matter.

2326
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:48,660
Add two more zeros to it.

2327
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:53,020
Have you made the money back?

2328
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:55,140
I don't know what's going on in my store right now.

2329
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:55,820
I'm opening packs.

2330
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:56,720
.

2331
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:00,060
.

2332
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:02,100
Doki don't do it.

2333
01:37:02,340 --> 01:37:04,440
What even is going on in my store?

2334
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:06,340
I'm too busy opening card packs.

2335
01:37:06,680 --> 01:37:08,020
I still have cards.

2336
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:08,660
It's fine.

2337
01:37:08,780 --> 01:37:09,800
I still have cards.

2338
01:37:10,540 --> 01:37:11,100
.

2339
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:13,580
Let's see.

2340
01:37:13,940 --> 01:37:14,500
.

2341
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,740
Oh wait, I have to do Q.

2342
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:18,800
Okay.

2343
01:37:18,940 --> 01:37:20,480
I'm going to go back to the beginning.

2344
01:37:21,260 --> 01:37:21,820
.

2345
01:37:26,030 --> 01:37:27,110
Twenty one.

2346
01:37:27,410 --> 01:37:28,130
There we go.

2347
01:37:29,550 --> 01:37:30,550
I have cards everywhere?

2348
01:37:30,750 --> 01:37:31,410
That's good, I do.

2349
01:37:32,870 --> 01:37:33,270
Okay.

2350
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:35,650
Oh shit, exactly?

2351
01:37:36,470 --> 01:37:38,150
Wait, what the fuck did he buy?

2352
01:37:39,530 --> 01:37:40,470
Okay, that's fine.

2353
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:43,250
Okay, let's see.

2354
01:37:43,310 --> 01:37:44,590
Are they supposed to leave?

2355
01:37:44,670 --> 01:37:45,770
No, it's still night time.

2356
01:37:46,430 --> 01:37:47,230
Oh yeah!

2357
01:37:47,770 --> 01:37:48,630
I have enough!

2358
01:37:49,790 --> 01:37:50,790
For more boxes.

2359
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:52,930
Wait, can I have the rare one yet?

2360
01:37:53,410 --> 01:37:54,210
Level 12.

2361
01:37:54,370 --> 01:37:55,090
No, it's fine.

2362
01:37:55,190 --> 01:37:55,910
I'll just buy these.

2363
01:37:56,790 --> 01:37:58,450
I'm fine with just buying these.

2364
01:37:58,450 --> 01:37:59,790
Oh my god, I can buy two.

2365
01:38:00,290 --> 01:38:02,390
I can buy... I can just...

2366
01:38:02,790 --> 01:38:04,050
I just haven't...

2367
01:38:04,510 --> 01:38:06,150
No, we'll do one for now.

2368
01:38:06,350 --> 01:38:07,130
We'll do one for now.

2369
01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:07,450
Okay.

2370
01:38:07,830 --> 01:38:08,430
That's good.

2371
01:38:08,930 --> 01:38:09,530
That's good.

2372
01:38:09,610 --> 01:38:10,490
Nobody touch this.

2373
01:38:10,550 --> 01:38:11,270
These are mine.

2374
01:38:11,610 --> 01:38:13,330
Nobody touch these.

2375
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:14,370
Nobody.

2376
01:38:14,890 --> 01:38:16,170
Nobody touch these.

2377
01:38:17,010 --> 01:38:18,010
Guys, it's okay.

2378
01:38:18,030 --> 01:38:18,230
Look.

2379
01:38:18,470 --> 01:38:19,630
I have six days.

2380
01:38:19,890 --> 01:38:21,030
It's due in six days.

2381
01:38:21,150 --> 01:38:21,570
It's fine.

2382
01:38:21,650 --> 01:38:22,290
What are you gonna do?

2383
01:38:22,350 --> 01:38:22,990
Shut me down?

2384
01:38:23,410 --> 01:38:25,830
Nobody touch... No, I saw you.

2385
01:38:25,830 --> 01:38:26,530
I saw you.

2386
01:38:26,570 --> 01:38:28,910
You were looking at these boxes of my cards.

2387
01:38:29,010 --> 01:38:30,110
I fucking see you.

2388
01:38:30,190 --> 01:38:31,770
This is my card box.

2389
01:38:32,010 --> 01:38:32,890
This is mine.

2390
01:38:33,130 --> 01:38:34,550
Don't you dare touch it.

2391
01:38:34,630 --> 01:38:35,130
Don't you?

2392
01:38:41,230 --> 01:38:44,030
This is my... These are my cards.

2393
01:38:44,330 --> 01:38:45,930
I'm watching all of you.

2394
01:38:46,010 --> 01:38:47,630
I'm fucking watching you guys.

2395
01:38:53,410 --> 01:38:55,230
You think I don't know?

2396
01:38:55,410 --> 01:38:56,230
You think... No!

2397
01:38:56,690 --> 01:38:57,210

Oh, no.

He's here for my fucking cards.

2402
01:39:02,310 --> 01:39:03,070
I can feel it.

2403
01:39:03,290 --> 01:39:04,430
I can feel it.

2404
01:39:06,870 --> 01:39:07,310
No.

2405
01:39:08,030 --> 01:39:08,470
No.

2406
01:39:09,450 --> 01:39:11,190
No, he's here for my cards.

2407
01:39:13,350 --> 01:39:14,070
Where is he?

2408
01:39:15,430 --> 01:39:16,070
Get away.

2409
01:39:16,330 --> 01:39:17,810
Get away from my cards.

2410
01:39:17,890 --> 01:39:19,490
Get away from my cards.

2411
01:39:19,750 --> 01:39:20,930
Get away from my cards.

2412
01:39:24,090 --> 01:39:24,530
Okay.

2413
01:39:26,630 --> 01:39:27,770
Let's put that in the corner.

2414
01:39:32,430 --> 01:39:35,310
I'm calling for a certain store manager.

2415
01:39:36,390 --> 01:39:37,090
All right.

2416
01:39:37,130 --> 01:39:37,430
Nice.

2417
01:39:37,530 --> 01:39:37,910
All right.

2418
01:39:38,110 --> 01:39:42,030
I need a bomb of the peasant booster packs.

2419
01:39:42,850 --> 01:39:43,330
Okay.

2420
01:39:43,530 --> 01:39:44,410
Oh, shit.

2421
01:39:44,510 --> 01:39:44,750
Whoops.

2422
01:39:45,550 --> 01:39:46,030
Whoops.

2423
01:39:47,090 --> 01:39:48,610
That's not what I wanted to do.

2424
01:39:49,030 --> 01:39:49,890
Oh, I know.

2425
01:39:50,870 --> 01:39:51,590
I know.

2426
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:56,260
Now they'll never steal.

2427
01:39:57,880 --> 01:39:58,980
No, I can't.

2428
01:39:59,000 --> 01:39:59,760
No, I can't.

2429
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:05,700
I was going to put it behind the front of this so they'll never be able to...

2430
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:07,880
So I can always keep my eye on it.

2431
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:11,700
All right.

2432
01:40:11,740 --> 01:40:12,360
What was that?

2433
01:40:12,380 --> 01:40:12,560
Oh, yeah.

2434
01:40:12,580 --> 01:40:13,800
I need regular packs.

2435
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:17,660
The regular packs for the commoners.

2436
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:19,420
All right.

2437
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:22,880
These guys, I don't care as much for.

2438
01:40:24,260 --> 01:40:26,200
I know it is me.

2439
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:29,480
My cards don't touch.

2440
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,300
Guys, I don't need to pay for my lighting bills yet.

2441
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:33,780
I have six more days.

2442
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:36,660
All right.

2443
01:40:37,340 --> 01:40:37,740
Leave.

2444
01:40:41,020 --> 01:40:41,420
Leave.

2445
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:42,680
I need to open my cards.

2446
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:43,720
Leave right now.

2447
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:46,980
Omni, thank you for the super chat.

2448
01:40:47,060 --> 01:40:47,420
Thank you.

2449
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:48,100
Thank you.

2450
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:49,480
Hey, just got here.

2451
01:40:49,620 --> 01:40:51,080
The game seems fun, but are you okay?

2452
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:53,040
You seem a little on edge.

2453
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:54,620
Thank you for the super chat.

2454
01:40:54,700 --> 01:40:55,580
Thank you.

2455
01:40:55,820 --> 01:40:57,100
I don't know what you're talking about.

2456
01:40:57,240 --> 01:40:59,600
I'm just enjoying my day being a card.

2457
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:00,260
I'm a shop owner.

2458
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:02,400
It's fine.

2459
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:06,140
Doki, please open this door.

2460
01:41:06,340 --> 01:41:07,100
No, it's okay.

2461
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:08,280
It's okay.

2462
01:41:12,860 --> 01:41:13,680
Cards first.

2463
01:41:20,780 --> 01:41:21,760
Cards first.

2464
01:41:25,340 --> 01:41:25,860
Exactly.

2465
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:28,420
I'm having the time of my life.

2466
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:29,620
Okay.

2467
01:41:29,620 --> 01:41:29,740
Okay.

2468
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:30,540
Come on.

2469
01:41:30,580 --> 01:41:31,620
Give me that.

2470
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:34,440
97.

2471
01:41:35,260 --> 01:41:36,460
So close.

2472
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:37,860
So close.

2473
01:41:38,380 --> 01:41:39,840
It's not the same.

2474
01:41:40,140 --> 01:41:41,520
It's not the same.

2475
01:41:46,620 --> 01:41:48,900
Not even a hundred dollars.

2476
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:52,580
It might as well be fucking dirt on the ground.

2477
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:03,600
I might as well just rip that card.

2478
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:10,020
What do you mean?

2479
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:14,320
It's not a hundred.

2480
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:15,780
It's not.

2481
01:42:15,820 --> 01:42:17,120
It might as well be five.

2482
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:19,080
It might as well be five dollars.

2483
01:42:20,940 --> 01:42:21,500
Yeah.

2484
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:21,640
Okay.

2485
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:23,520
See.

2486
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:24,560
See.

2487
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:25,660
It's not what I mean.

2488
01:42:26,360 --> 01:42:29,440
What Tetra Vaan does to a person.

2489
01:42:31,220 --> 01:42:31,520
Okay.

2490
01:42:32,260 --> 01:42:32,560
14.

2491
01:42:34,620 --> 01:42:35,680
A hundred.

2492
01:42:35,980 --> 01:42:37,880
It might as well be a hundred.

2493
01:42:37,980 --> 01:42:38,120
Oh wait.

2494
01:42:38,180 --> 01:42:38,720
No, I shouldn't.

2495
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:40,380
That should be Market Price 10%.

2496
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:41,140
There we go.

2497
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:44,760
May I interest you in Candler's Anonymous?

2498
01:42:46,220 --> 01:42:47,740
I don't have a problem!

2499
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:49,320
She said calmly.

2500
01:42:49,660 --> 01:42:50,260
Okay.

2501
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:51,740
That's fine.

2502
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:55,220
I told you these boxes were worth it.

2503
01:42:55,780 --> 01:42:57,020
I told you.

2504
01:43:00,380 --> 01:43:02,000
Might as well be one cent.

2505
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:03,880
It might as well be a fucking freebie.

2506
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:08,700
I can stop whenever I want, chat.

2507
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:11,920
I can stop whenever I fucking want.

2508
01:43:16,580 --> 01:43:18,660
Wait, I can afford more boxes!

2509
01:43:21,820 --> 01:43:22,260
Guys!

2510
01:43:22,820 --> 01:43:24,860
I can afford more boxes guys!

2511
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:27,260
Oh my god.

2512
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:28,080
Oh my god.

2513
01:43:28,220 --> 01:43:29,400
I just made enough.

2514
01:43:30,020 --> 01:43:32,640
I just made enough to buy another eight pack.

2515
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:33,840
Oh my god!

2516
01:43:34,220 --> 01:43:35,480
Get that phone in!

2517
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:37,380
I can afford another eight pack.

2518
01:43:37,460 --> 01:43:38,260
Let's fucking go!

2519
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:40,560
Okay.

2520
01:43:40,820 --> 01:43:41,460
Get away!

2521
01:43:41,580 --> 01:43:42,100
Get away, dude.

2522
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:42,660
This is mine.

2523
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:43,220
Get away.

2524
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:43,800
This is mine.

2525
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:44,760
Don't you dare.

2526
01:43:44,900 --> 01:43:46,520
Don't you dare come close to it.

2527
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:48,100
This is my corner of boxes.

2528
01:43:48,340 --> 01:43:51,600
These are Don't you fucking dare.

2529
01:43:51,620 --> 01:44:00,800
I have five more days to pay rent!

2530
01:44:01,060 --> 01:44:01,720
It's fine!

2531
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:03,700
It's fine!

2532
01:44:05,320 --> 01:44:07,500
Four more days to pay rent!

2533
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:10,240
I have plenty of time.

2534
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:12,000
Look, see?

2535
01:44:14,040 --> 01:44:15,940
Look, five days.

2536
01:44:16,140 --> 01:44:20,040
As long as I pay bills by the end of the day, it'll be okay.

2537
01:44:20,380 --> 01:44:21,560
It'll be okay.

2538
01:44:22,260 --> 01:44:25,960
Do you save up money you can open a box of rare packs?

2539
01:44:26,340 --> 01:44:28,100
Yeah, but I need to be level 12!

2540
01:44:28,340 --> 01:44:29,700
It doesn't matter!

2541
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:31,880
All I can do is... I need to be level nine!

2542
01:44:32,740 --> 01:44:43,200
Look, for the people, because I feel very generous right now, look, I will give one.

2543
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:44,960
There you go.

2544
01:44:45,740 --> 01:44:46,320
See?

2545
01:44:46,780 --> 01:44:48,620
I am so generous.

2546
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:57,960
I am willing to sell one of my boxes that I bought with my money.

2547
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,820
What if the hundred is in that one?

2548
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:01,720
You're so right!

2549
01:45:02,220 --> 01:45:03,860
No, no, you're so right.

2550
01:45:04,060 --> 01:45:05,100
You're so fucking right.

2551
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:06,960
I should... oh my god, how could I?

2552
01:45:07,180 --> 01:45:08,880
Oh my god, why would I?

2553
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:11,960
Oh my god, I can't believe I almost went crazy there.

2554
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:13,700
Thank you, thank you, man.

2555
01:45:13,940 --> 01:45:22,120
Thank you for telling me, making me, breaking me up, with that crazy spell I had, because I was so close.

2556
01:45:28,100 --> 01:45:35,200
I can't believe I almost went crazy there, for a second.

2557
01:45:35,340 --> 01:45:38,680
Thank you for giving me rational thought right there.

2558
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:39,820
You're so right.

2559
01:45:40,060 --> 01:45:42,980
This could be the winning box chat.

2560
01:45:43,220 --> 01:45:44,960
This could actually be...

2561
01:45:45,470 --> 01:45:46,820
I... I'm...

2562
01:45:46,820 --> 01:45:47,580
I'm taking it straight now.

2563
01:45:52,700 --> 01:45:53,300
Alright.

2564
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:58,200
Nine dollars.

2565
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:00,500
Use your nine.

2566
01:46:01,980 --> 01:46:04,200
Okay, and then one dollar.

2567
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:06,820
Wait, I can't buy more.

2568
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:07,800
Guys.

2569
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:10,220
Oh my god.

2570
01:46:10,460 --> 01:46:12,200
I can buy another box.

2571
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:13,820
I just made enough.

2572
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:16,000
I just made enough.

2573
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:17,140
For my corner.

2574
01:46:21,100 --> 01:46:23,840
Oh my god, I literally just made enough.

2575
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:28,800
Alright.

2576
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:30,480
Another box.

2577
01:46:32,620 --> 01:46:34,520
Gotta make sure nobody takes this.

2578
01:46:36,240 --> 01:46:36,760
Alright.

2579
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:37,840
Come on.

2580
01:46:39,860 --> 01:46:42,320
Guys, I have five more days to pay my bills.

2581
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:46,220
As long as I pay my bills, at the end of the day, it will work.

2582
01:46:48,620 --> 01:46:49,680
Fucking trash.

2583
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:55,320
They run the store, so you can level up.

2584
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:57,460
Sorry, Donkey, but this has to stop.

2585
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:00,120
I can stop whenever I want.

2586
01:47:00,620 --> 01:47:01,220
Gladstone.

2587
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:02,840
Thank you for the super chat.

2588
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:03,240
Thank you.

2589
01:47:03,740 --> 01:47:07,140
I can stop whenever I want.

2590
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,900
I don't have a problem.

2591
01:47:10,300 --> 01:47:11,760
I'm just trying to...

2592
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:12,720
Oh, fucking trash.

2593
01:47:13,820 --> 01:47:14,680
It might as well be...

2594
01:47:14,680 --> 01:47:16,820
It might as well be garbage.

2595
01:47:22,860 --> 01:47:23,940
Come on.

2596
01:47:23,940 --> 01:47:25,340
Give me that hundred dollars.

2597
01:47:25,540 --> 01:47:27,640
I need it to hit a hundred dollars.

2598
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:29,380
Okay.

2599
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:30,280
Rare packs.

2600
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:31,400
Oh, she bought cards.

2601
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:35,420
Oh, 16?

2602
01:47:35,660 --> 01:47:37,460
Oh shit, that gave you too much money.

2603
01:47:37,980 --> 01:47:39,200
Uh, 16.

2604
01:47:40,380 --> 01:47:40,920
Okay.

2605
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:41,880
She bought cards.

2606
01:47:42,420 --> 01:47:43,500
Uh, which card did you buy?

2607
01:47:43,740 --> 01:47:44,620
Oh, you bought this one.

2608
01:47:46,300 --> 01:47:48,940
Alright, that is market price 62.

2609
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:50,600
Alright, there we go.

2610
01:47:50,940 --> 01:47:51,660
That's fine.

2611
01:47:52,620 --> 01:47:53,880
Want me to restock anything?

2612
01:47:54,180 --> 01:47:55,000
No, that's okay.

2613
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:56,620
I can keep going.

2614
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:04,640
Come on.

2615
01:48:06,360 --> 01:48:08,160
Eventually, I'll hit that hundred dollars.

2616
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:10,020
If I spend 300...

2617
01:48:10,020 --> 01:48:15,300
500 dollars in boxes, eventually that one box will be a hundred banger.

2618
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:17,800
That's how probability works, guys.

2619
01:48:18,080 --> 01:48:18,680
That's...

2620
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:20,660
That's how it works.

2621
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:27,140
500 dollars will eventually get me that hundred dollar profit.

2622
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:30,080
It's right there.

2623
01:48:30,180 --> 01:48:31,420
I can feel it.

2624
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:34,880
I can feel it.

2625
01:48:39,140 --> 01:48:40,040
Let's go!

2626
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:42,080
I knew it!

2627
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:44,140
I knew it!

2628
01:48:44,260 --> 01:48:44,680
Yes!

2629
01:48:45,340 --> 01:48:48,240
I fucking knew it!

2630
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:49,940
You all doubted me!

2631
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:52,740
You all fucking...

2632
01:48:52,740 --> 01:48:54,760
You all doubted me!

2633
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,120
None of you were believers!

2634
01:48:57,500 --> 01:48:58,420
Never quit!

2635
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:05,500
Oh my god!

2636
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:07,180
Never quit!

2637
01:49:13,820 --> 01:49:16,320
I fucking knew it!

2638
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:19,160
I fucking knew it!

2639
01:49:19,660 --> 01:49:20,900
I fucking knew it!

2640
01:49:20,900 --> 01:49:22,560
It was the last pack, too!

2641
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:23,220
It was the last pack, too!

2642
01:49:23,220 --> 01:49:24,100
Oh my god!

2643
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:27,520
Get this fucking card out of here!

2644
01:49:28,580 --> 01:49:31,160
Get this card out of here!

2645
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:32,520
I need my... Where is it?

2646
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:35,580
I need to put that fucking price...

2647
01:49:35,580 --> 01:49:37,080
Where is it?

2648
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:40,900
Where the fuck is my 400 dollar card?

2649
01:49:41,220 --> 01:49:42,880
Where the fuck is it?

2650
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:46,160
Where is my 400 dollar card?

2651
01:49:47,340 --> 01:49:50,140
Where the fuck is my 400...

2652
01:49:50,140 --> 01:49:50,920
Where the fuck is my 400...

2653
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:51,160
Where the fuck is my 400...

2654
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:53,500
Where the fuck is my 400...

2655
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:54,620
Where is...

2656
01:49:54,620 --> 01:49:56,020
Oh there it is!

2657
01:49:56,260 --> 01:49:57,340
Look at that!

2658
01:49:57,720 --> 01:50:00,820
Four hundred and five dollars!

2659
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:04,160
Now time to sell this fucking...

2660
01:50:08,300 --> 01:50:12,880
Now time to sell this fucking...

2661
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:14,440
Five boxes right there!

2662
01:50:16,340 --> 01:50:18,860
Guys, you don't understand!

2663
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:20,880
That's five boxes!

2664
01:50:20,900 --> 01:50:24,560
That's five eight packs right there!

2665
01:50:25,380 --> 01:50:30,300
That's gonna get me five eight packs right there!

2666
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:38,520
I'm gonna have so much money right there!

2667
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:41,860
Pay here!

2668
01:50:42,020 --> 01:50:42,640
Oh god!

2669
01:50:42,820 --> 01:50:43,460
Oh god!

2670
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:43,880
No!

2671
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:44,820
I don't want the card!

2672
01:50:44,940 --> 01:50:45,200
No!

2673
01:50:46,100 --> 01:50:46,580
Okay.

2674
01:50:48,680 --> 01:50:49,740
That's right, get clean!

2675
01:50:50,060 --> 01:50:50,780
Get clean!

2676
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:53,080
Okay, I'm gonna resell this.

2677
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:54,320
People will buy it.

2678
01:50:54,420 --> 01:50:55,140
They don't know.

2679
01:50:56,740 --> 01:50:57,720
They don't know.

2680
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:02,240
They don't know.

2681
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:03,420
Alright.

2682
01:51:03,640 --> 01:51:04,880
We can do this again.

2683
01:51:05,860 --> 01:51:07,120
Oh my god!

2684
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:08,500
I knew if you don't...

2685
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:09,700
I knew it!

2686
01:51:09,780 --> 01:51:11,760
None of you believed me!

2687
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:14,540
None of you fucking believed me!

2688
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:16,540
I told you!

2689
01:51:16,740 --> 01:51:18,940
If I hoard all the boxes!

2690
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:24,060
If I hoard all the boxes, I'll eventually get the good cards!

2691
01:51:24,540 --> 01:51:31,080
If I keep hoarding it...

2692
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:34,400
I knew the boxes had the good shit!

2693
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:35,660
I fucking knew it!

2694
01:51:36,720 --> 01:51:39,000
I'm gonna sell it for 500!

2695
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:40,960
You think I'll actually pay for 500?

2696
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:41,860
You're right!

2697
01:51:41,940 --> 01:51:45,400
If I sell it for 500, I can get 5 boxes of cards!

2698
01:51:45,620 --> 01:51:46,460
You're so right!

2699
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:47,640
You're...

2700
01:51:50,980 --> 01:51:52,200
You're so right!

2701
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:53,080
Chat!

2702
01:51:53,160 --> 01:51:53,800
Oh my god!

2703
01:51:53,820 --> 01:51:55,520
How could I be so delusional?

2704
01:51:55,980 --> 01:51:58,180
Selling for 445!

2705
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:04,860
He's just... He's not even here for cards.

2706
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:06,400
He's just here for deodorant.

2707
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:08,160
Oh my god!

2708
01:52:08,200 --> 01:52:08,540
Wait!

2709
01:52:08,700 --> 01:52:09,620
I can buy...

2710
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:11,060
Wait!

2711
01:52:11,060 --> 01:52:13,580
I can buy... I can buy two more boxes right now!

2712
01:52:13,820 --> 01:52:17,680
I can literally... I can literally buy two boxes right now!

2713
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:18,680
You're so...

2714
01:52:19,540 --> 01:52:20,180
Oh wait!

2715
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:20,460
You're right!

2716
01:52:20,780 --> 01:52:22,040
$499.99!

2717
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:23,200
They'll think it's a bargain!

2718
01:52:23,900 --> 01:52:24,600
Oh my god!

2719
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:31,840
Since I put it at $500, and then I put it down at $499.99, then that means they'll be like, oh my god!

2720
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:33,080
It's like 10% off!

2721
01:52:33,300 --> 01:52:35,540
They'll think it's 10% off at that point.

2722
01:52:35,740 --> 01:52:36,700
Wait for $1.99.

2723
01:52:36,720 --> 01:52:37,380
Who fucking cares?

2724
01:52:37,500 --> 01:52:38,960
That's not $400.

2725
01:52:41,480 --> 01:52:42,500
It doesn't matter.

2726
01:52:43,420 --> 01:52:43,900
Look!

2727
01:52:43,980 --> 01:52:47,100
The bill man's not gonna... The IRS...

2728
01:52:47,100 --> 01:52:50,840
The bank is not gonna repossess my store until like...

2729
01:52:50,840 --> 01:52:55,000
If I... If I pay at the last day, they're not gonna repossess my store, guys.

2730
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:55,960
They're not...

2731
01:52:57,980 --> 01:53:02,780
As long as the store gets paid and as long as the bills... Look, see?

2732
01:53:02,940 --> 01:53:04,220
I have five more days.

2733
01:53:04,460 --> 01:53:06,020
I have five more days of this.

2734
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:07,440
I can keep going.

2735
01:53:07,660 --> 01:53:09,280
I don't have a problem.

2736
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:11,940
Oh my god, I almost forgot the most important thing.

2737
01:53:12,440 --> 01:53:13,900
I almost forgot.

2738
01:53:14,540 --> 01:53:16,860
I can't believe I could be so foolish.

2739
01:53:17,340 --> 01:53:19,060
I'm gonna buy two boxes now.

2740
01:53:20,060 --> 01:53:21,220
Oh my god.

2741
01:53:21,480 --> 01:53:22,940
I was so foolish.

2742
01:53:23,400 --> 01:53:25,760
I was so foolish into thinking.

2743
01:53:26,260 --> 01:53:28,540
Oh my god, I can literally...

2744
01:53:28,540 --> 01:53:31,240
I can literally pay for this now.

2745
01:53:31,860 --> 01:53:32,820
This is fine.

2746
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:34,520
Look, I just... Look.

2747
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:36,260
I just need to pay.

2748
01:53:36,600 --> 01:53:38,200
Like, it's only 150.

2749
01:53:38,580 --> 01:53:39,800
I can do that later.

2750
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,880
I can pay 150 later.

2751
01:53:42,440 --> 01:53:42,680
I...

2752
01:53:48,160 --> 01:53:50,080
I'm investing, guys.

2753
01:53:50,220 --> 01:53:50,980
You don't understand.

2754
01:53:51,120 --> 01:53:52,100
This is an investment.

2755
01:53:58,300 --> 01:53:58,900
Exactly.

2756
01:53:58,980 --> 01:54:03,620
Any card that's less than 250 dollars is a waste of my time.

2757
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:05,800
And my money.

2758
01:54:06,260 --> 01:54:09,800
And it is an insult to my customers.

2759
01:54:10,780 --> 01:54:11,980
As in me.

2760
01:54:12,120 --> 01:54:13,260
I am the customer.

2761
01:54:13,580 --> 01:54:14,100
I...

2762
01:54:14,100 --> 01:54:22,060
I am the customer.

2763
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:23,960
And it is an insult to me.

2764
01:54:27,660 --> 01:54:29,240
Yes, they are.

2765
01:54:29,560 --> 01:54:32,060
Yes, they are buying a single card.

2766
01:54:32,340 --> 01:54:33,320
Yes, they are.

2767
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:35,120
You don't understand.

2768
01:54:35,820 --> 01:54:36,340
Maybe...

2769
01:54:36,340 --> 01:54:37,720
Okay, but what if... Okay, wait.

2770
01:54:37,900 --> 01:54:38,320
Alright.

2771
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:41,900
I'll do 445.99.

2772
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:43,740
That'll be such a steal.

2773
01:54:43,980 --> 01:54:47,380
That'll be... Look at these single pack losers.

2774
01:54:48,440 --> 01:54:48,960
Yeah.

2775
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:50,440
Buying single packs.

2776
01:54:50,640 --> 01:54:52,420
They don't know the ultimate hack.

2777
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:53,560
Buy the boxes.

2778
01:54:53,780 --> 01:54:55,320
That's where all the money is.

2779
01:54:55,560 --> 01:54:56,000
That's...

2780
01:54:58,040 --> 01:54:59,500
They don't need lights.

2781
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:03,100
They'll play in whatever environment I tell them to play.

2782
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:03,520
Leave.

2783
01:55:03,660 --> 01:55:04,440
Leave the store.

2784
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:05,860
Nobody's gonna play with you.

2785
01:55:05,900 --> 01:55:07,900
And I need to close the store in like...

2786
01:55:07,900 --> 01:55:10,120
in like 10 minutes.

2787
01:55:10,900 --> 01:55:11,860
Nobody's gonna be playing.

2788
01:55:12,040 --> 01:55:12,540
Leave.

2789
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:16,260
Leave.

2790
01:55:17,020 --> 01:55:19,500
I need the light to open my... Oh my god.

2791
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:20,360
140.42.

2792
01:55:20,600 --> 01:55:21,600
You know what that means.

2793
01:55:22,720 --> 01:55:24,260
It's another set of boxes.

2794
01:55:24,580 --> 01:55:25,340
Right here.

2795
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:27,060
Right here.

2796
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:28,820
Oh my god.

2797
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:29,360
More cards.

2798
01:55:31,100 --> 01:55:31,860
Right here.

2799
01:55:31,900 --> 01:55:32,680
My little...

2800
01:55:32,680 --> 01:55:33,340
Oh.

2801
01:55:33,340 --> 01:55:33,760
Holy...

2802
01:55:34,520 --> 01:55:34,780
Shit.

2803
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:36,680
That's... She's feeding my addiction.

2804
01:55:37,060 --> 01:55:37,660
She... No.

2805
01:55:37,740 --> 01:55:38,480
It's not addiction.

2806
01:55:38,620 --> 01:55:39,200
It's a lifestyle.

2807
01:55:39,300 --> 01:55:42,000
She's feeding into my perfectly normal hobby.

2808
01:55:43,340 --> 01:55:43,940
Guys.

2809
01:55:48,040 --> 01:55:48,960
She knows.

2810
01:55:49,940 --> 01:55:50,540
She...

2811
01:55:50,540 --> 01:55:51,160
She cares.

2812
01:55:51,460 --> 01:55:53,420
She truly cares about me.

2813
01:55:54,300 --> 01:55:54,900
Okay.

2814
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:56,280
Alright.

2815
01:55:56,540 --> 01:55:57,680
Nobody get close to it.

2816
01:55:57,740 --> 01:55:58,480
This is my corner.

2817
01:55:58,880 --> 01:55:59,200
Nope.

2818
01:55:59,220 --> 01:56:00,300
Don't you fucking dare.

2819
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:01,880
Don't you fucking dare.

2820
01:56:02,160 --> 01:56:03,660
Get close to my box.

2821
01:56:04,520 --> 01:56:05,560
I'm gonna put it right here for now.

2822
01:56:05,700 --> 01:56:08,940
I'm gonna put it right here so I can open it and then open.

2823
01:56:09,780 --> 01:56:11,060
Nobody touch my box.

2824
01:56:11,420 --> 01:56:12,660
Nobody touch it.

2825
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:13,680
Alright.

2826
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:15,680
There we go.

2827
01:56:16,780 --> 01:56:17,820
We gotta keep going.

2828
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:22,260
We're gonna get that ultimate rare card.

2829
01:56:22,380 --> 01:56:23,120
This is it.

2830
01:56:24,740 --> 01:56:25,400
This is it.

2831
01:56:26,300 --> 01:56:27,280
It can't be...

2832
01:56:28,220 --> 01:56:30,340
It has to be more than $200.

2833
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:30,600
Shit.

2834
01:56:30,600 --> 01:56:31,460
That's nothing to me.

2835
01:56:31,680 --> 01:56:33,540
That's nothing to me.

2836
01:56:36,360 --> 01:56:37,580
That's nothing.

2837
01:56:37,620 --> 01:56:38,200
That's nothing.

2838
01:56:38,200 --> 01:56:38,280
$74?

2839
01:56:38,980 --> 01:56:42,180
Might be like fucking regular paper then.

2840
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:43,820
Get out.

2841
01:56:44,060 --> 01:56:45,340
No litter.

2842
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:47,600
Buy real card bags.

2843
01:56:52,280 --> 01:56:53,480
Never stop.

2844
01:56:53,660 --> 01:56:56,080
If you stop gambling right now, you're gonna...

2845
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:59,680
You're gonna miss out on hitting it big.

2846
01:57:01,300 --> 01:57:02,100
Okay.

2847
01:57:02,100 --> 01:57:02,720
$8.

2848
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:03,440
I still have...

2849
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:09,060
I'm like... I'm like so close to being able to afford to pay... to buy more packs.

2850
01:57:09,340 --> 01:57:10,480
To buy more boxes.

2851
01:57:10,940 --> 01:57:12,840
Might as well be toilet paper.

2852
01:57:13,020 --> 01:57:13,580
Exactly.

2853
01:57:14,100 --> 01:57:17,000
You give me... That's just extra toilet paper.

2854
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:21,140
I don't need to buy toilet paper when I have garbage cards like these.

2855
01:57:21,660 --> 01:57:23,100
Fucking $11?

2856
01:57:26,580 --> 01:57:29,280
99% gamblers quit before they hit it big.

2857
01:57:29,400 --> 01:57:29,860
Exactly.

2858
01:57:30,060 --> 01:57:31,320
You know what's up.

2859
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:32,780
You know what's up.

2860
01:57:39,700 --> 01:57:40,280
Okay.

2861
01:57:40,340 --> 01:57:40,900
$14.

2862
01:57:41,200 --> 01:57:47,160
Since the Tetramon addiction is real, I might as well ask a thousand Pokemon pack opening.

2863
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:47,860
Alright.

2864
01:57:48,280 --> 01:57:50,660
When the fuck is Pokemon?

2865
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:54,720
I am only loyal to my one and only Tetramon.

2866
01:57:56,800 --> 01:58:00,500
Pokemon wishes they can be as good as Tetramon.

2867
01:58:01,260 --> 01:58:01,840
Alright.

2868
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:02,980
Let's put those cards in here.

2869
01:58:03,540 --> 01:58:04,120
Whoops.

2870
01:58:06,260 --> 01:58:06,840
What?

2871
01:58:09,060 --> 01:58:09,260
Okay.

2872
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:10,800
How do I... Oh, sort my album.

2873
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:12,000
Do I have any destiny cards?

2874
01:58:12,180 --> 01:58:12,380
No.

2875
01:58:12,500 --> 01:58:13,440
I only have Tetramon.

2876
01:58:15,300 --> 01:58:15,820
Alright.

2877
01:58:15,820 --> 01:58:16,340
Uh...

2878
01:58:16,340 --> 01:58:17,280
Market price.

2879
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:18,600
There we go.

2880
01:58:18,820 --> 01:58:20,280
Oh, I have another one that's sold.

2881
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:24,140
Market price 10%.

2882
01:58:24,140 --> 01:58:25,440
There we go.

2883
01:58:27,140 --> 01:58:27,660
Uh...

2884
01:58:29,260 --> 01:58:29,780
$14.

2885
01:58:31,820 --> 01:58:32,780
Oh my god.

2886
01:58:32,840 --> 01:58:36,100
This is like taking time away from what I actually care about.

2887
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:38,040
Hahahaha.

2888
01:58:40,920 --> 01:58:42,300
Fucking... I need a higher...

2889
01:58:42,300 --> 01:58:44,800
I need to be level 10 so I can just full time commit to this.

2890
01:58:45,220 --> 01:58:45,700
Like...

2891
01:58:45,700 --> 01:58:47,100
No, they're fine.

2892
01:58:47,240 --> 01:58:48,200
The shells are fine.

2893
01:58:48,460 --> 01:58:50,040
It has everything they need.

2894
01:58:53,900 --> 01:58:55,700
I have stuff on the rack.

2895
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:57,300
Doesn't matter.

2896
01:58:57,480 --> 01:58:58,820
I have the stuff on the rack.

2897
01:58:58,940 --> 01:58:59,740
That's all they need.

2898
01:59:00,980 --> 01:59:01,460
Hahahaha.

2899
01:59:03,800 --> 01:59:04,280
Hahahaha.

2900
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:06,760
Alright.

2901
01:59:07,540 --> 01:59:08,340
Come on.

2902
01:59:08,820 --> 01:59:12,900
There has to be another $200 card somewhere in here.

2903
01:59:13,420 --> 01:59:15,640
There has to be... Oh my god!

2904
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:16,880
I just made enough!

2905
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:18,360
Who cares about that?

2906
01:59:18,380 --> 01:59:19,180
It's not even $100.

2907
01:59:19,860 --> 01:59:21,260
Who cares about that?

2908
01:59:22,460 --> 01:59:23,400
Come on.

2909
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:25,440
We'll hit it big.

2910
01:59:25,680 --> 01:59:26,580
Oh, that's good.

2911
01:59:26,740 --> 01:59:27,300
That's good.

2912
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:29,020
They continue to feed my addiction.

2913
01:59:29,400 --> 01:59:30,120
That's good.

2914
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:32,460
Where's my box?

2915
01:59:32,680 --> 01:59:33,560
There it is.

2916
01:59:33,900 --> 01:59:34,420
Hahahaha.

2917
01:59:34,980 --> 01:59:35,900
There it is.

2918
01:59:36,620 --> 01:59:37,140
I mean, not my addiction.

2919
01:59:37,140 --> 01:59:37,140
Hahahaha.

2920
01:59:38,120 --> 01:59:38,880
There it is.

2921
01:59:39,080 --> 01:59:39,460
There it is.

2922
01:59:41,160 --> 01:59:42,420
I mean, not my addiction.

2923
01:59:42,600 --> 01:59:43,900
My perfectly normal hobby.

2924
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:47,300
That I don't have a problem with.

2925
01:59:50,100 --> 01:59:50,620
Uh...

2926
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:53,960
106.47.

2927
01:59:54,140 --> 01:59:54,840
Alright, here we go.

2928
01:59:56,400 --> 01:59:56,920
Okay.

2929
01:59:57,580 --> 01:59:58,440
That here.

2930
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:00,340
Market price.

2931
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:00,940
There we go.

2932
02:00:01,780 --> 02:00:02,540
It's fine.

2933
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:07,000
I'm...

2934
02:00:08,180 --> 02:00:13,520
I was wondering how people fall into addiction.

2935
02:00:13,880 --> 02:00:16,880
But now, thanks to Doki, I now understand.

2936
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:21,360
Come on.

2937
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:22,040
Come on.

2938
02:00:22,040 --> 02:00:23,940
There has to be another one.

2939
02:00:24,060 --> 02:00:25,920
There has to be another one.

2940
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:30,340
There has to be $40.

2941
02:00:30,340 --> 02:00:30,560
There has to be $40.

2942
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:32,020
Get out of my fucking eyes!

2943
02:00:33,060 --> 02:00:36,120
I might as well I might as well feed this car to my fucking dog.

2944
02:00:36,900 --> 02:00:41,840
I might as well fucking put it on the sidewalk and let the cars run over it.

2945
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:46,620
One for the shelf, one for you.

2946
02:00:46,900 --> 02:00:49,140
One for the shelf?!

2947
02:00:49,140 --> 02:00:50,880
That's way too many ones.

2948
02:00:52,840 --> 02:00:54,900
That's way too many ones.

2949
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:55,860
What do you mean?

2950
02:00:56,340 --> 02:00:56,900
Okay.

2951
02:01:01,720 --> 02:01:02,300
Here we go.

2952
02:01:03,320 --> 02:01:05,460
Wait, can I buy other stuff now?

2953
02:01:07,200 --> 02:01:08,160
What is it?

2954
02:01:08,280 --> 02:01:10,020
Oh, I can buy card sleeves.

2955
02:01:11,820 --> 02:01:12,520
Okay, fine.

2956
02:01:13,300 --> 02:01:15,280
I'll buy... Oh wait, what's this?

2957
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:15,860
Dice.

2958
02:01:16,240 --> 02:01:17,580
Oh, there's other stuff?

2959
02:01:18,940 --> 02:01:20,940
I guess I'll let you guys have some dice.

2960
02:01:23,260 --> 02:01:24,260
Oh, $200?

2961
02:01:25,880 --> 02:01:27,600
That's way too many dice.

2962
02:01:29,980 --> 02:01:31,380
Oh, there's figures!

2963
02:01:32,300 --> 02:01:34,160
Oh, wait, that's cute!

2964
02:01:36,340 --> 02:01:37,740
Wait, that's pretty cute.

2965
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:40,700
What other stuff?

2966
02:01:41,740 --> 02:01:43,940
Wait, I can't afford my stuff anymore.

2967
02:01:44,200 --> 02:01:46,260
Okay, we still have booster packs here.

2968
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:48,200
And then...

2969
02:01:50,280 --> 02:01:51,580
Okay, trash.

2970
02:01:52,340 --> 02:01:53,360
Trash area.

2971
02:01:53,740 --> 02:01:56,440
Now to do what I'm truly passionate about.

2972
02:01:58,680 --> 02:02:00,340
Yeah, that's what I'm saying!

2973
02:02:00,340 --> 02:02:00,740
Yay!

2974
02:02:01,020 --> 02:02:02,600
$200 for dice?

2975
02:02:02,700 --> 02:02:05,240
I better make some actual money off of those.

2976
02:02:10,680 --> 02:02:12,220
That's fine, we don't need those.

2977
02:02:14,580 --> 02:02:15,580
Okay, nope.

2978
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:17,520
Come on, come on.

2979
02:02:17,940 --> 02:02:20,940
I hit that $400 pack earlier.

2980
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:23,200
They must have another one.

2981
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:25,620
They must have another one.

2982
02:02:25,660 --> 02:02:27,480
There were so many ghost cards.

2983
02:02:27,480 --> 02:02:30,840
The ghost cards must be worth millions of dollars!

2984
02:02:32,820 --> 02:02:34,940
Save for the upgraded- Oh my god!

2985
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:36,480
Oh my god!

2986
02:02:36,520 --> 02:02:38,320
You need deodorant, mister!

2987
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:40,500
Sir, get over back here!

2988
02:02:40,620 --> 02:02:41,580
Get back over here!

2989
02:02:42,250 --> 02:02:43,400
Get back over here.

2990
02:02:44,040 --> 02:02:45,000
Get clean.

2991
02:02:45,240 --> 02:02:46,720
Get back over here.

2992
02:02:47,380 --> 02:02:49,200
Get back over here.

2993
02:02:49,500 --> 02:02:52,640
I will use this entire can until you're okay!

2994
02:02:53,160 --> 02:02:53,760
I-

2995
02:02:59,740 --> 02:03:04,880
It's never too late for deodorant.

2996
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:06,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

2997
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:07,700
It's never too late.

2998
02:03:08,660 --> 02:03:09,140
Okay.

2999
02:03:09,720 --> 02:03:10,440
Let's see.

3000
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:11,360
$1.

3001
02:03:13,220 --> 02:03:15,580
Oh my god, you bought so many rare cards.

3002
02:03:15,820 --> 02:03:17,900
This loser doesn't know it's all in the boxes.

3003
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:22,480
$27.

3004
02:03:23,940 --> 02:03:26,760
Okay, I can put another card in here.

3005
02:03:28,900 --> 02:03:29,520
Nice, alright.

3006
02:03:29,880 --> 02:03:30,500
Is there any other?

3007
02:03:30,620 --> 02:03:31,540
Oh, that one just sold.

3008
02:03:31,880 --> 02:03:33,140
That means I can put another one.

3009
02:03:35,140 --> 02:03:35,540
Alright.

3010
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:37,400
It's time.

3011
02:03:38,220 --> 02:03:39,580
It's time for more cards.

3012
02:03:39,960 --> 02:03:40,680
Wait, do I have?

3013
02:03:40,840 --> 02:03:41,460
Okay, yeah.

3014
02:03:41,560 --> 02:03:44,260
I just need $10 more so I can buy dice for you guys.

3015
02:03:44,460 --> 02:03:45,280
But that's it.

3016
02:03:45,820 --> 02:03:46,920
That's all I'm gonna do.

3017
02:03:47,900 --> 02:03:51,420
Maybe I should just make this store a figure store instead of a card game store.

3018
02:03:51,540 --> 02:03:53,300
So then I can keep all the cards to myself.

3019
02:03:54,060 --> 02:03:54,980
Maybe I should...

3020
02:03:54,980 --> 02:03:57,260
Maybe I should make this a dice store.

3021
02:03:57,460 --> 02:04:01,300
So I can use it to afford my trading card.

3022
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:12,260
Oh no, give me a sec.

3023
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:13,460
Where do I put this?

3024
02:04:14,620 --> 02:04:16,660
There has to be...

3025
02:04:17,740 --> 02:04:18,760
Put these in here.

3026
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:19,720
Okay.

3027
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:22,540
I need to look at it.

3028
02:04:23,200 --> 02:04:24,280
Where is that $400?

3029
02:04:24,360 --> 02:04:26,020
Oh my god!

3030
02:04:27,040 --> 02:04:29,280
Look at this card!

3031
02:04:32,280 --> 02:04:33,000
$400!

3032
02:04:37,060 --> 02:04:38,700
Oh my god.

3033
02:04:38,780 --> 02:04:40,560
I'm gonna sell it right now.

3034
02:04:41,820 --> 02:04:44,000
They bought the other $400.

3035
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,640
This lady bought the other $400.

3036
02:04:51,710 --> 02:04:53,590
She bought the other $400.

3037
02:04:54,410 --> 02:04:59,310
Lady, are you sure I can't tempt you with this card too?

3038
02:04:59,510 --> 02:05:00,210
Lady, are you sure I can't tempt you with this card too?

3039
02:05:00,210 --> 02:05:00,590
Oh!

3040
02:05:05,290 --> 02:05:07,150
Look at that.

3041
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:09,090
She bought...

3042
02:05:09,090 --> 02:05:10,990
Wait, I need to add .99.

3043
02:05:11,310 --> 02:05:13,250
Oh my god!

3044
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:15,710
Imagine all the...

3045
02:05:17,180 --> 02:05:19,300
I can buy so many.

3046
02:05:19,980 --> 02:05:20,720
I can...

3047
02:05:20,720 --> 02:05:21,700
Oh my god, oh my god.

3048
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:22,540
Wait, wait.

3049
02:05:22,780 --> 02:05:23,860
Where's my phone?

3050
02:05:24,160 --> 02:05:27,060
Okay, we're gonna buy...

3051
02:05:27,060 --> 02:05:30,560
First, we're gonna buy the plushy license first.

3052
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:32,320
And then...

3053
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:35,380
And then we'll buy...

3054
02:05:35,380 --> 02:05:35,900
Oh, okay.

3055
02:05:35,960 --> 02:05:36,980
We got the plushy license.

3056
02:05:37,420 --> 02:05:39,420
Wait, can I afford the plushies?

3057
02:05:39,800 --> 02:05:40,280
Okay.

3058
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:41,440
Oh, I can!

3059
02:05:41,580 --> 02:05:43,120
I think I just made enough.

3060
02:05:43,820 --> 02:05:44,300
No!

3061
02:05:44,620 --> 02:05:46,120
I literally need $0.76.

3062
02:05:46,720 --> 02:05:47,240
Thank you.

3063
02:05:47,240 --> 02:05:48,160
That is what I needed.

3064
02:05:48,500 --> 02:05:49,680
That is what I...

3065
02:05:52,380 --> 02:05:55,760
Guys, I still have enough time!

3066
02:05:58,590 --> 02:05:59,170
Guys, I still have enough time!

3067
02:05:59,190 --> 02:05:59,350
Guys, look!

3068
02:05:59,850 --> 02:06:01,890
Look at my phone, guys.

3069
02:06:01,930 --> 02:06:02,910
Look at it right now.

3070
02:06:03,290 --> 02:06:04,410
Four days.

3071
02:06:04,690 --> 02:06:05,970
I still have four days, guys.

3072
02:06:06,110 --> 02:06:07,270
I still have four days.

3073
02:06:07,390 --> 02:06:08,050
It's five.

3074
02:06:08,250 --> 02:06:09,910
I still have four days.

3075
02:06:09,950 --> 02:06:11,630
This is much more important, chat.

3076
02:06:11,870 --> 02:06:13,930
This is much more important.

3077
02:06:14,250 --> 02:06:15,150
We'll buy...

3078
02:06:15,150 --> 02:06:16,390
Add this to the cart.

3079
02:06:16,690 --> 02:06:17,490
And then...

3080
02:06:17,490 --> 02:06:20,870
We can finally sell other stuff now.

3081
02:06:21,510 --> 02:06:23,110
We can finally...

3082
02:06:23,110 --> 02:06:26,890
We can finally sell other things.

3083
02:06:27,410 --> 02:06:27,950
We can finally sell other things.

3084
02:06:27,950 --> 02:06:28,790
Okay, there you go.

3085
02:06:29,190 --> 02:06:30,690
And then we have card sleeves, too.

3086
02:06:30,750 --> 02:06:32,130
And we'll put it at the bottom rack.

3087
02:06:34,110 --> 02:06:36,910
We can finally afford to sell other things.

3088
02:06:37,810 --> 02:06:38,370
We can finally afford to sell other things.

3089
02:06:38,370 --> 02:06:38,910
It's fine.

3090
02:06:38,970 --> 02:06:39,690
We have...

3091
02:06:41,150 --> 02:06:41,670
Okay.

3092
02:06:42,690 --> 02:06:43,390
There we go.

3093
02:06:43,430 --> 02:06:44,590
Into the corner it goes.

3094
02:06:44,930 --> 02:06:46,410
Oh, he also bought cards.

3095
02:06:48,310 --> 02:06:49,170
Yeah, that's fine.

3096
02:06:49,430 --> 02:06:50,010
Let's see.

3097
02:06:50,730 --> 02:06:51,810
Okay, prices.

3098
02:06:52,070 --> 02:06:52,950
Market price.

3099
02:06:53,410 --> 02:06:53,930
10%.

3100
02:06:53,930 --> 02:06:54,550
There we go.

3101
02:06:54,730 --> 02:06:56,350
And then, market price.

3102
02:06:56,810 --> 02:06:57,330
10%.

3103
02:06:57,330 --> 02:06:59,030
Wait, market price.

3104
02:06:59,070 --> 02:06:59,170
10%.

3105
02:06:59,970 --> 02:07:00,770
3 dollars.

3106
02:07:01,290 --> 02:07:02,010
There we go.

3107
02:07:02,510 --> 02:07:02,990
See?

3108
02:07:03,370 --> 02:07:04,950
We're making money.

3109
02:07:08,190 --> 02:07:09,110
This is fine.

3110
02:07:09,470 --> 02:07:10,630
I told you, guys.

3111
02:07:10,750 --> 02:07:11,850
I told you.

3112
02:07:12,410 --> 02:07:13,850
No, no, no, no, guys.

3113
02:07:14,030 --> 02:07:14,470
No, no.

3114
02:07:14,530 --> 02:07:16,550
It's 200 dollars, guys.

3115
02:07:16,690 --> 02:07:18,750
Rent is only 200 dollars.

3116
02:07:19,570 --> 02:07:21,250
It's literally 200 dollars.

3117
02:07:22,070 --> 02:07:22,270
It's literally 200 dollars.

3118
02:07:22,270 --> 02:07:23,330
I can afford it.

3119
02:07:23,630 --> 02:07:24,630
It'll be fine.

3120
02:07:24,870 --> 02:07:25,350
Oh, see?

3121
02:07:25,510 --> 02:07:26,150
Look at that.

3122
02:07:26,470 --> 02:07:28,330
64 dollars already.

3123
02:07:29,250 --> 02:07:30,750
Look at that.

3124
02:07:31,130 --> 02:07:32,590
And you know what that means.

3125
02:07:37,160 --> 02:07:38,620
Oh, I can save up.

3126
02:07:38,740 --> 02:07:40,280
I can buy the rare boxes.

3127
02:07:40,640 --> 02:07:42,140
These don't matter anymore.

3128
02:07:42,440 --> 02:07:44,960
These won't matter when I have the rare boxes.

3129
02:07:45,400 --> 02:07:45,840
Wait.

3130
02:07:46,740 --> 02:07:50,120
600 and 500 dollars is a four pack.

3131
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:57,300
So now all I need to do is just save up 500 dollars so I can buy the rare boxes.

3132
02:07:57,660 --> 02:08:00,040
And then I can sell the basic boxes.

3133
02:08:00,120 --> 02:08:02,340
Because these don't fucking matter anymore.

3134
02:08:12,890 --> 02:08:19,770
Guys, and then I can sell the basic boxes because the rare boxes are even better.

3135
02:08:23,750 --> 02:08:25,070
Oh my god.

3136
02:08:25,470 --> 02:08:31,070
And then I can get cards that might be worth 600 dollars, chat.

3137
02:08:31,410 --> 02:08:34,470
Imagine I can get the 600 dollar pack.

3138
02:08:38,990 --> 02:08:39,870
Just imagine.

3139
02:08:40,350 --> 02:08:41,810
Oh my god.

3140
02:08:42,010 --> 02:08:42,810
Guys, it's okay.

3141
02:08:42,850 --> 02:08:43,670
I have four more days.

3142
02:08:43,830 --> 02:08:45,810
I have four more days to pay for rent.

3143
02:08:48,050 --> 02:08:48,710
It's okay.

3144
02:08:48,770 --> 02:08:49,830
I have four more days.

3145
02:08:50,130 --> 02:08:53,210
I can pay for four more days left.

3146
02:08:55,410 --> 02:08:56,030
It's okay.

3147
02:08:58,250 --> 02:08:59,770
I'll just be a plushy store.

3148
02:09:03,510 --> 02:09:07,470
I'll just be a plushy store to fund my TCG hobby.

3149
02:09:12,570 --> 02:09:13,310
That's it.

3150
02:09:14,890 --> 02:09:16,190
Okay, I'm kicking you out.

3151
02:09:16,330 --> 02:09:16,890
Okay, nice.

3152
02:09:17,210 --> 02:09:19,030
How do I change the name of my store?

3153
02:09:19,310 --> 02:09:20,050
I want...

3154
02:09:22,870 --> 02:09:25,830
No, I only pull cards in the day.

3155
02:09:26,030 --> 02:09:27,250
I only...

3156
02:09:28,270 --> 02:09:29,570
Guys, you don't understand.

3157
02:09:29,790 --> 02:09:31,910
I can only pull cards during the day.

3158
02:09:32,850 --> 02:09:33,370
Alright,

3159
02:09:40,670 --> 02:09:41,070
come on.

3160
02:09:41,530 --> 02:09:43,950
You just came in here to look at my sleeve.

3161
02:09:44,470 --> 02:09:45,510
I can't.

3162
02:09:45,510 --> 02:09:47,190
I need to pull cards.

3163
02:09:47,590 --> 02:09:48,390
I need to...

3164
02:09:48,390 --> 02:09:50,470
I need to pull cards.

3165
02:09:50,610 --> 02:09:52,910
How do I change the name of my store, chat?

3166
02:09:55,190 --> 02:09:55,750
How do I change the name of my store, chat?

3167
02:09:55,750 --> 02:09:57,550
Guys, how do I change the name of my store?

3168
02:09:59,490 --> 02:10:00,610
I'm rebranding.

3169
02:10:00,810 --> 02:10:02,270
I'm rebranding.

3170
02:10:04,830 --> 02:10:05,390
Escape?

3171
02:10:06,790 --> 02:10:07,810
Is this settings?

3172
02:10:08,670 --> 02:10:08,950
No.

3173
02:10:09,090 --> 02:10:10,050
How do I...

3174
02:10:10,050 --> 02:10:13,830
I need to change... I need to change the name of my store.

3175
02:10:17,600 --> 02:10:19,260
You need to pay...

3176
02:10:20,440 --> 02:10:22,480
I need to rebrand.

3177
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:25,880
Guys, I need to rebrand my store.

3178
02:10:31,900 --> 02:10:33,420
How do I...

3179
02:10:34,460 --> 02:10:35,780
Okay, store upgrade.

3180
02:10:35,960 --> 02:10:37,260
I don't need to upgrade my store.

3181
02:10:37,700 --> 02:10:40,200
My store is perfect as it is.

3182
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:45,520
You can't rebrand...

3183
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:51,280
How am I supposed to rebrand my store if I can't change the name?

3184
02:10:51,280 --> 02:10:55,620
How would they know I'm not a plushy store anymore?

3185
02:10:56,120 --> 02:10:56,680
I'm...

3186
02:10:58,040 --> 02:10:59,980
I'm not a card store anymore.

3187
02:11:00,020 --> 02:11:01,360
I'm here to sell plushies.

3188
02:11:04,100 --> 02:11:05,580
That's where the money is.

3189
02:11:08,480 --> 02:11:09,360
Oh, whoops.

3190
02:11:09,380 --> 02:11:09,780
Not that.

3191
02:11:10,160 --> 02:11:10,720
85.

3192
02:11:12,600 --> 02:11:13,160
91.

3193
02:11:13,500 --> 02:11:14,060
Okay.

3194
02:11:14,180 --> 02:11:14,800
Oh, shit.

3195
02:11:15,780 --> 02:11:16,760
Get out of here.

3196
02:11:17,140 --> 02:11:18,020
Be clean.

3197
02:11:18,600 --> 02:11:19,380
That's right.

3198
02:11:19,380 --> 02:11:21,540
And then I'll make sure to resell it again.

3199
02:11:23,480 --> 02:11:24,420
Alright, let's see.

3200
02:11:24,660 --> 02:11:25,080
32.

3201
02:11:26,200 --> 02:11:29,320
.09 Alright, what do you have?

3202
02:11:29,540 --> 02:11:30,560
Oh, see, look at that!

3203
02:11:30,780 --> 02:11:33,220
The plushies are making so much money!

3204
02:11:36,100 --> 02:11:37,180
Look at that!

3205
02:11:39,780 --> 02:11:41,660
Okay, we gotta put this card down.

3206
02:11:45,890 --> 02:11:46,610
What do I need?

3207
02:11:46,710 --> 02:11:47,950
Okay, I need more basic packs.

3208
02:11:48,130 --> 02:11:50,610
Okay, I need to buy this.

3209
02:11:52,050 --> 02:11:52,530
And...

3210
02:11:53,210 --> 02:11:53,690
this.

3211
02:11:57,080 --> 02:11:58,000
I fucked up.

3212
02:11:58,180 --> 02:11:58,740
It's fine.

3213
02:12:00,040 --> 02:12:01,000
And then...

3214
02:12:01,680 --> 02:12:03,160
we'll make it back with plushies.

3215
02:12:03,380 --> 02:12:04,040
It's okay.

3216
02:12:04,100 --> 02:12:06,940
We'll make it back with... what is he just T-man pose?

3217
02:12:07,540 --> 02:12:08,220
It's okay.

3218
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:09,160
I still have this.

3219
02:12:09,660 --> 02:12:10,940
I still have this.

3220
02:12:11,940 --> 02:12:12,620
It's okay.

3221
02:12:15,260 --> 02:12:15,980
It's fine.

3222
02:12:16,340 --> 02:12:17,580
I still have this.

3223
02:12:18,100 --> 02:12:19,680
I can't believe I started working.

3224
02:12:20,240 --> 02:12:20,720
.

3225
02:12:20,720 --> 02:12:20,820
.

3226
02:12:20,820 --> 02:12:21,140
.

3227
02:12:21,140 --> 02:12:21,920
.

3228
02:12:21,920 --> 02:12:22,340
.

3229
02:12:22,340 --> 02:12:23,540
.

3230
02:12:23,560 --> 02:12:26,020
I can't believe I started working.

3231
02:12:26,220 --> 02:12:27,340
I'm not here to work.

3232
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:30,540
I'm here for my passion.

3233
02:12:31,880 --> 02:12:33,960
This is where my true passion is.

3234
02:12:36,440 --> 02:12:37,320
Come on.

3235
02:12:37,540 --> 02:12:38,840
Come on, I didn't...

3236
02:12:39,300 --> 02:12:40,660
I didn't open for a while.

3237
02:12:40,740 --> 02:12:41,240
Come on.

3238
02:12:41,780 --> 02:12:42,740
Where is it?

3239
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:44,640
It should have stockpiled.

3240
02:12:46,880 --> 02:12:48,720
They should have stockpiled!

3241
02:12:49,500 --> 02:12:50,180
You won.

3242
02:12:51,640 --> 02:12:52,120
Okay.

3243
02:12:52,120 --> 02:12:53,160
$6, that's fine.

3244
02:12:53,860 --> 02:12:55,140
Alright, we're gonna...

3245
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:57,000
put that in here.

3246
02:12:58,220 --> 02:12:59,080
There we go.

3247
02:12:59,760 --> 02:13:01,020
Where is... Okay.

3248
02:13:01,160 --> 02:13:03,020
Are the card sleeves too expensive?

3249
02:13:03,420 --> 02:13:04,780
Why is it too expensive?

3250
02:13:06,060 --> 02:13:06,660
Okay.

3251
02:13:06,780 --> 02:13:08,420
2.50.

3252
02:13:08,560 --> 02:13:09,700
That's the lowest I'll go.

3253
02:13:09,960 --> 02:13:11,780
You gotta protect your cards somewhere.

3254
02:13:12,180 --> 02:13:13,500
Like, don't think I don't know.

3255
02:13:15,300 --> 02:13:17,700
You gotta protect those cards.

3256
02:13:19,200 --> 02:13:19,800
Okay.

3257
02:13:19,800 --> 02:13:19,880
Okay.

3258
02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:23,620
Fuck, you might as well...

3259
02:13:23,620 --> 02:13:25,300
I'm gonna rip that card in half right now.

3260
02:13:25,500 --> 02:13:26,500
You guys don't believe me.

3261
02:13:26,560 --> 02:13:26,980
Watch this.

3262
02:13:31,200 --> 02:13:33,560
That's where the $100 card went.

3263
02:13:37,840 --> 02:13:38,280
Wow...

3264
02:13:43,240 --> 02:13:46,900
Anything under $500 is nothing, Timmy.

3265
02:13:47,140 --> 02:13:47,900
It's not...

3266
02:13:48,640 --> 02:13:49,080
Oh...

3267
02:13:50,500 --> 02:13:53,800
Dedication to the... Doki, no!

3268
02:13:54,320 --> 02:13:55,240
No!

3269
02:13:57,140 --> 02:14:00,200
The immersion is so real.

3270
02:14:00,760 --> 02:14:03,800
Not the blue eyes white dragon, no!

3271
02:14:05,300 --> 02:14:11,340
She's... at least Kaiba was passionate about every card!

3272
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:21,560
64.18 Look at that, my plushies are fucking going crazy right now.

3273
02:14:24,180 --> 02:14:27,960
I knew the plushies were the right investment in the end.

3274
02:14:28,180 --> 02:14:29,600
I fucking knew it.

3275
02:14:31,180 --> 02:14:31,780
Okay.

3276
02:14:32,040 --> 02:14:34,100
No, Kaiba would never rip the cards.

3277
02:14:34,300 --> 02:14:34,900
I would.

3278
02:14:37,180 --> 02:14:38,560
Kaiba was a pussy.

3279
02:14:39,820 --> 02:14:42,740
Kaiba would never rip up every card.

3280
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:48,840
He did rip cards, but he didn't go all the way.

3281
02:14:49,140 --> 02:14:49,720
He...

3282
02:14:50,580 --> 02:14:53,440
He didn't go all the way.

3283
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:03,220
He could have committed, but no, he had to start having feelings.

3284
02:15:05,040 --> 02:15:09,460
He started caring about his fucking little brother.

3285
02:15:09,460 --> 02:15:10,000
He started a lie to him.

3286
02:15:13,740 --> 02:15:14,240
Alright, this is the last one.

3287
02:15:15,540 --> 02:15:16,120
There's another one.

3288
02:15:16,140 --> 02:15:16,320
And then there is a card here.

3289
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:16,360
And then I have four.

3290
02:15:16,360 --> 02:15:18,780
Okay, so...

3291
02:15:19,460 --> 02:15:19,960
Five.

3292
02:15:24,200 --> 02:15:24,780
Okay so...

3293
02:15:24,780 --> 02:15:25,580
I'm pretty sure I won that.

3294
02:15:26,800 --> 02:15:27,300
Okay.

3295
02:15:27,620 --> 02:15:31,220
I'm pretty sure I won that.

3296
02:15:31,220 --> 02:15:31,340
Okay, so...

3297
02:15:33,400 --> 02:15:36,720
I don't even care who's card it belongs to.

3298
02:15:36,760 --> 02:15:40,780
Even if it belongs to me, if you're a weak card, I'm gonna keep ripping.

3299
02:15:41,120 --> 02:15:43,100
I'm gonna keep ripping those cards.

3300
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:47,280
That's fucking weak.

3301
02:15:47,400 --> 02:15:49,020
Can't even rip your own cards.

3302
02:15:51,480 --> 02:15:52,100
Alright.

3303
02:15:53,580 --> 02:15:56,340
She's gotten mad with power.

3304
02:16:02,100 --> 02:16:02,800
It's fine.

3305
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:03,320
Okay.

3306
02:16:03,960 --> 02:16:05,580
We must hit another 500.

3307
02:16:07,080 --> 02:16:08,660
That's so trash.

3308
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:10,300
That's so fucking trash.

3309
02:16:10,640 --> 02:16:13,100
Why did you waste- Fuck off.

3310
02:16:13,420 --> 02:16:15,220
Only $383?

3311
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:16,420
Are you serious?

3312
02:16:17,260 --> 02:16:19,480
Only 300- You know what I'm gonna do with that card?

3313
02:16:19,820 --> 02:16:22,480
You know what I'm gonna do with that $383?

3314
02:16:25,360 --> 02:16:27,940
Oh, you know what I'm gonna do, chat?

3315
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:29,500
Give me a sec.

3316
02:16:29,560 --> 02:16:31,080
Let me open the other pack.

3317
02:16:31,080 --> 02:16:34,320
Let me open my other packs first.

3318
02:16:34,600 --> 02:16:36,580
Before I show you what I'll do.

3319
02:16:39,740 --> 02:16:41,500
Wait, let me- Give me a sec.

3320
02:16:41,580 --> 02:16:42,300
I actually have customers.

3321
02:16:42,660 --> 02:16:46,740
Give me- I have to do this dumb shit.

3322
02:16:48,180 --> 02:16:51,180
I have to fucking do my job, apparently.

3323
02:16:55,100 --> 02:16:55,660
Okay.

3324
02:16:55,660 --> 02:16:56,460
There we go.

3325
02:16:58,700 --> 02:16:59,780
Uh, okay.

3326
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:00,500
Okay.

3327
02:17:01,080 --> 02:17:01,220
That's enough.

3328
02:17:01,300 --> 02:17:01,520
Okay.

3329
02:17:01,640 --> 02:17:02,540
This is what I'm gonna do.

3330
02:17:19,400 --> 02:17:23,840
I can't even- I can't even put it in the trash.

3331
02:17:24,280 --> 02:17:24,760
No!

3332
02:17:28,740 --> 02:17:32,340
If I could, I would have actually thrown that card away.

3333
02:17:33,400 --> 02:17:37,820
That's like- That's red money dookie!

3334
02:17:38,080 --> 02:17:38,760
Stop!

3335
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:42,560
This game is a coward.

3336
02:17:42,980 --> 02:17:44,820
This game is weak.

3337
02:17:44,980 --> 02:17:48,360
It won't let me throw away fucking garbage.

3338
02:17:50,520 --> 02:17:54,600
I should be legally allowed to throw away fucking garbage cards.

3339
02:17:56,940 --> 02:18:00,300
She has become more spoiled than that now.

3340
02:18:00,300 --> 02:18:02,740
Someone has to stop her.

3341
02:18:02,920 --> 02:18:06,680
Thank you for getting to rehab now.

3342
02:18:07,300 --> 02:18:10,780
Thank you for the super chat, MrBrokenPond.

3343
02:18:10,880 --> 02:18:12,040
Thank you, thank you.

3344
02:18:12,780 --> 02:18:14,540
Let's see, $18.

3345
02:18:15,720 --> 02:18:18,500
Can't be allowed to put it in my fucking store.

3346
02:18:20,220 --> 02:18:21,580
Fucking disgusting!

3347
02:18:24,480 --> 02:18:30,020
Can't be allowed to put this disgusting card in my fucking store.

3348
02:18:32,540 --> 02:18:32,940
$421?

3349
02:18:35,260 --> 02:18:35,660
Alright,

3350
02:18:40,180 --> 02:18:40,740
let's see.

3351
02:18:40,840 --> 02:18:41,680
One, two, three.

3352
02:18:42,240 --> 02:18:43,460
Point one, two.

3353
02:18:44,920 --> 02:18:46,000
Alright, oh shit.

3354
02:18:46,060 --> 02:18:48,440
Oh my god, I don't have- Okay.

3355
02:18:48,860 --> 02:18:50,160
It's okay, I can afford it now.

3356
02:18:52,160 --> 02:18:52,960
Where is it?

3357
02:18:53,520 --> 02:18:54,920
Oh, I'll put this here for now.

3358
02:18:55,820 --> 02:18:56,980
Oh, it's okay, he left.

3359
02:18:58,320 --> 02:18:59,600
It's okay, he left.

3360
02:19:00,320 --> 02:19:01,720
I'll put this here too.

3361
02:19:05,300 --> 02:19:06,900
And then- Oh, okay.

3362
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:10,000
I'll just put this here because this has remaining stock.

3363
02:19:10,560 --> 02:19:12,200
And then I'll put this here.

3364
02:19:12,680 --> 02:19:13,820
Uh-oh, stinky.

3365
02:19:14,280 --> 02:19:17,920
Sell it for a dollar out of spite.

3366
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:23,580
Damn.

3367
02:19:23,940 --> 02:19:25,400
And you called me mad.

3368
02:19:25,960 --> 02:19:27,860
You called me mad with power.

3369
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:31,620
Okay, box has no items in it.

3370
02:19:31,620 --> 02:19:31,840
Okay.

3371
02:19:33,120 --> 02:19:34,000
Holy shit.

3372
02:19:35,260 --> 02:19:38,900
I need to make sure I have enough plushies for my plushy store.

3373
02:19:40,460 --> 02:19:41,860
Wait, can I afford this now?

3374
02:19:42,100 --> 02:19:42,920
No, I can't.

3375
02:19:42,940 --> 02:19:43,880
I need to buy the license.

3376
02:19:44,620 --> 02:19:45,540
What other stuff?

3377
02:19:45,660 --> 02:19:47,160
Oh, I can buy dice now, right?

3378
02:19:48,180 --> 02:19:49,060
It's $218.

3379
02:19:49,100 --> 02:19:50,100
Oh yeah, I can.

3380
02:19:51,320 --> 02:19:51,760
Alright.

3381
02:19:51,860 --> 02:19:53,420
Maybe I'll make more prof money.

3382
02:19:53,560 --> 02:19:54,020
Oh, wait.

3383
02:19:57,960 --> 02:19:59,220
Come on, get clean.

3384
02:19:59,460 --> 02:20:00,080
Get clean.

3385
02:20:00,080 --> 02:20:03,660
If you're gonna be playing cards, you gotta make sure you're clean like the rest of us.

3386
02:20:06,080 --> 02:20:06,800
That's space.

3387
02:20:08,360 --> 02:20:08,960
Okay, wait.

3388
02:20:09,020 --> 02:20:09,760
I'll put this here.

3389
02:20:10,320 --> 02:20:11,500
I'll put this here.

3390
02:20:12,100 --> 02:20:14,500
And now I have space for my dice store.

3391
02:20:16,400 --> 02:20:18,520
Because this is now a dice store, guys.

3392
02:20:20,720 --> 02:20:21,200
Okay.

3393
02:20:23,040 --> 02:20:23,740
There we go.

3394
02:20:25,240 --> 02:20:25,780
We're fine.

3395
02:20:27,560 --> 02:20:29,280
Okay, give me my money.

3396
02:20:30,680 --> 02:20:32,680
And then back to card opening.

3397
02:20:33,200 --> 02:20:36,640
Oh my god, we're almost level 10 and then everything can be automated.

3398
02:20:36,700 --> 02:20:40,020
And I can truly invest in what I actually love.

3399
02:20:44,140 --> 02:20:44,780
It's alright.

3400
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:49,800
The child doesn't need to be paid until six days.

3401
02:20:50,440 --> 02:20:52,620
I'll just pay the child in store credit.

3402
02:20:52,780 --> 02:20:53,340
It's fine.

3403
02:20:53,680 --> 02:20:58,520
And as long as the child doesn't go near my fucking corner, Sash, he'll be okay.

3404
02:21:00,080 --> 02:21:00,980
Okay, I just need like...

3405
02:21:00,980 --> 02:21:03,860
I just need $500 so I can buy the rare boxes.

3406
02:21:04,320 --> 02:21:08,480
And then like when I buy the rare boxes, I can sell the basic bitch boxes.

3407
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:12,460
And then I'm gonna make thousands of dollars off the rare boxes.

3408
02:21:13,500 --> 02:21:15,080
That's where the money comes in, guys.

3409
02:21:15,100 --> 02:21:15,740
You don't understand.

3410
02:21:16,080 --> 02:21:17,920
That's where the big ticket items are.

3411
02:21:19,780 --> 02:21:21,080
That's the big ticket items.

3412
02:21:21,380 --> 02:21:22,040
Right there.

3413
02:21:26,140 --> 02:21:26,980
It's okay, guys.

3414
02:21:27,020 --> 02:21:27,620
Do not worry.

3415
02:21:28,920 --> 02:21:29,760
Do not worry.

3416
02:21:29,840 --> 02:21:30,400
We're gonna...

3417
02:21:30,880 --> 02:21:32,120
We're gonna make it all back.

3418
02:21:33,080 --> 02:21:33,860
Right here.

3419
02:21:36,220 --> 02:21:38,300
We're gonna make it all back, chat.

3420
02:21:39,780 --> 02:21:40,780
The last day.

3421
02:21:41,060 --> 02:21:42,760
The last day is where it matters.

3422
02:21:42,860 --> 02:21:44,220
We still have three days, guys.

3423
02:21:44,540 --> 02:21:45,760
We have three days.

3424
02:21:45,820 --> 02:21:46,660
We can do this.

3425
02:21:47,940 --> 02:21:48,820
We have...

3426
02:21:49,780 --> 02:21:51,140
We have three days.

3427
02:21:51,200 --> 02:21:51,700
It's fine.

3428
02:21:52,760 --> 02:21:53,980
It's so fine.

3429
02:21:54,380 --> 02:21:56,140
We have three days, guys.

3430
02:21:57,480 --> 02:21:59,440
Oh, and then I can get more space here.

3431
02:22:02,720 --> 02:22:04,360
Three days is where it's at.

3432
02:22:07,820 --> 02:22:08,700
Come on, guys.

3433
02:22:09,060 --> 02:22:11,260
Oh, are you looking at my $400 card?

3434
02:22:11,560 --> 02:22:12,280
Are you like...

3435
02:22:16,180 --> 02:22:17,760
We can make it all back.

3436
02:22:17,960 --> 02:22:19,300
It's so easy.

3437
02:22:20,480 --> 02:22:21,300
Three days.

3438
02:22:21,380 --> 02:22:21,580
Yeah.

3439
02:22:21,620 --> 02:22:23,480
Three days may as well be two weeks.

3440
02:22:23,580 --> 02:22:24,380
I told you.

3441
02:22:24,600 --> 02:22:27,980
Is this game actually fun or just your average sim store game?

3442
02:22:28,460 --> 02:22:29,140
It's all right.

3443
02:22:29,500 --> 02:22:29,940
Like...

3444
02:22:29,940 --> 02:22:31,060
It's all right.

3445
02:22:31,580 --> 02:22:32,020
Okay.

3446
02:22:32,480 --> 02:22:32,640
Okay.

3447
02:22:33,220 --> 02:22:33,740
Nice.

3448
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:34,420
All right.

3449
02:22:34,420 --> 02:22:35,000
Thank you for the...

3450
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,120
Free chat.

3451
02:22:37,360 --> 02:22:37,880
Thank you.

3452
02:22:37,900 --> 02:22:38,780
Thank you.

3453
02:22:40,480 --> 02:22:42,560
I really appreciate it.

3454
02:22:42,560 --> 02:22:43,440
Thank you so much.

3455
02:22:45,340 --> 02:22:45,960
All right.

3456
02:22:46,060 --> 02:22:46,360
Yeah.

3457
02:22:46,420 --> 02:22:47,380
I can stop whenever I want.

3458
02:22:48,360 --> 02:22:49,140
I can...

3459
02:22:49,140 --> 02:22:51,440
I can stop whenever I want.

3460
02:22:51,820 --> 02:22:52,680
All right, guys.

3461
02:22:52,760 --> 02:22:53,600
9 PM.

3462
02:22:53,800 --> 02:22:54,620
It's almost there.

3463
02:22:54,820 --> 02:22:55,980
It's almost there.

3464
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:56,600
9 PM.

3465
02:22:56,640 --> 02:22:57,540
It's almost there.

3466
02:23:00,340 --> 02:23:01,160
It's all right.

3467
02:23:01,180 --> 02:23:02,020
Spends $500.

3468
02:23:02,140 --> 02:23:02,620
It's almost there.

3469
02:23:02,640 --> 02:23:04,840
Get out.

3470
02:23:04,920 --> 02:23:05,540
It's 9.

3471
02:23:06,580 --> 02:23:07,440
Get out.

3472
02:23:07,780 --> 02:23:09,060
The clock stopped.

3473
02:23:10,820 --> 02:23:13,440
It stopped exactly at 9.

3474
02:23:13,560 --> 02:23:14,180
Now leave.

3475
02:23:15,440 --> 02:23:16,300
That's right.

3476
02:23:16,680 --> 02:23:17,660
Oh, nice.

3477
02:23:18,400 --> 02:23:19,360
Oh shit!

3478
02:23:19,540 --> 02:23:20,300
She bought dice.

3479
02:23:20,500 --> 02:23:21,180
I told you.

3480
02:23:21,280 --> 02:23:22,300
The dice market.

3481
02:23:22,440 --> 02:23:23,480
We're GameStop now.

3482
02:23:25,840 --> 02:23:27,500
20.28 28.

3483
02:23:30,200 --> 02:23:33,300
We stopped at exactly closing time.

3484
02:23:36,930 --> 02:23:37,420
Let's see.

3485
02:23:37,540 --> 02:23:38,560
We have...

3486
02:23:38,560 --> 02:23:40,000
Oh yeah!

3487
02:23:40,140 --> 02:23:42,000
Eventually we'll start making profit.

3488
02:23:45,920 --> 02:23:48,160
We're almost there at profit!

3489
02:23:50,620 --> 02:23:51,320
Okay.

3490
02:23:51,480 --> 02:23:52,260
There we go.

3491
02:23:52,740 --> 02:23:54,060
Am I missing anything?

3492
02:23:55,830 --> 02:23:56,180
Okay.

3493
02:23:56,180 --> 02:23:56,740
Cards, please.

3494
02:23:57,120 --> 02:23:57,920
We have cards to use here.

3495
02:23:58,320 --> 02:23:58,760
Okay.

3496
02:23:58,800 --> 02:24:00,820
We need $500 and we're fine.

3497
02:24:01,720 --> 02:24:03,400
We just need $500.

3498
02:24:04,700 --> 02:24:05,920
And then we'll be okay.

3499
02:24:07,300 --> 02:24:07,740
Alright.

3500
02:24:08,960 --> 02:24:09,400
No.

3501
02:24:09,520 --> 02:24:10,560
Rent is not due yet.

3502
02:24:10,640 --> 02:24:11,340
We have three more.

3503
02:24:11,420 --> 02:24:12,120
We have two days.

3504
02:24:21,300 --> 02:24:22,180
So close.

3505
02:24:23,180 --> 02:24:24,060
So close.

3506
02:24:31,140 --> 02:24:33,080
So close.

3507
02:24:40,100 --> 02:24:42,000
Only $440.

3508
02:24:49,360 --> 02:24:51,080
Tokido, please.

3509
02:24:51,240 --> 02:24:52,200
Tokido, please.

3510
02:24:52,520 --> 02:24:53,920
Tokido, please.

3511
02:24:53,920 --> 02:24:55,800
Tokido, please.

3512
02:24:55,800 --> 02:24:59,260
You know what I see when I see that $440 card?

3513
02:24:59,740 --> 02:25:01,960
You know what I see, chat?

3514
02:25:02,800 --> 02:25:08,540
I'll show you what I see when I see a $440 card.

3515
02:25:09,320 --> 02:25:10,660
I'll show you.

3516
02:25:11,060 --> 02:25:12,420
That's fucking right.

3517
02:25:12,940 --> 02:25:13,780
Toki, no.

3518
02:25:13,840 --> 02:25:14,160
Please.

3519
02:25:14,680 --> 02:25:15,240
Toki.

3520
02:25:15,380 --> 02:25:16,580
Toki, what are you doing?

3521
02:25:16,700 --> 02:25:16,980
Please.

3522
02:25:17,200 --> 02:25:18,140
Toki, what are...

3523
02:25:18,140 --> 02:25:19,860
What are you doing, Toki?

3524
02:25:20,080 --> 02:25:21,480
What are you doing?

3525
02:25:22,700 --> 02:25:23,520
That's right.

3526
02:25:23,520 --> 02:25:25,700
That's what it deserves.

3527
02:25:33,700 --> 02:25:34,760
That's right.

3528
02:25:34,880 --> 02:25:35,780
Look at that.

3529
02:25:35,860 --> 02:25:41,940
It's 0.01 cent and nobody is buying it.

3530
02:25:42,140 --> 02:25:42,680
You...

3531
02:25:48,420 --> 02:25:50,080
Look at that.

3532
02:25:50,220 --> 02:25:53,500
That's how worthless this card is.

3533
02:25:55,480 --> 02:25:58,960
That's how fucking worthless it is.

3534
02:25:59,460 --> 02:26:03,240
Nobody is buying it right now.

3535
02:26:03,620 --> 02:26:05,080
Look at that.

3536
02:26:06,380 --> 02:26:07,640
This guy, look.

3537
02:26:07,880 --> 02:26:10,320
Oh, he's just here for dice.

3538
02:26:15,360 --> 02:26:19,840
He fucking didn't even look at it.

3539
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,380
He's just here for dice.

3540
02:26:24,200 --> 02:26:26,580
Look at all these people.

3541
02:26:26,980 --> 02:26:31,100
They are just skipping over that worthless card.

3542
02:26:35,380 --> 02:26:36,620
Look at that.

3543
02:26:36,760 --> 02:26:39,400
He bought that card instead.

3544
02:26:43,090 --> 02:26:45,870
I mean, what did you expect?

3545
02:26:46,410 --> 02:26:50,130
I told you that card was fucking worthless to me.

3546
02:26:50,330 --> 02:26:51,230
Look at that.

3547
02:26:51,310 --> 02:26:53,010
He bought this card.

3548
02:26:53,130 --> 02:26:54,350
That's $33.

3549
02:26:54,350 --> 02:26:59,990
Instead of a card that's supposedly worth $400.

3550
02:27:00,410 --> 02:27:07,390
I told you that's a fucking worthless card.

3551
02:27:07,630 --> 02:27:09,110
I fucking told you, chat.

3552
02:27:09,750 --> 02:27:14,210
I told you nobody loves it.

3553
02:27:14,350 --> 02:27:16,650
It's just a fucking paperweight.

3554
02:27:17,130 --> 02:27:18,790
It doesn't deserve anything.

3555
02:27:20,030 --> 02:27:21,830
Back to card opening.

3556
02:27:21,830 --> 02:27:24,770
Back to what I'm truly passionate about.

3557
02:27:31,190 --> 02:27:32,910
All right.

3558
02:27:33,620 --> 02:27:34,430
Come on.

3559
02:27:34,710 --> 02:27:36,490
$500 Roonies.

3560
02:27:38,970 --> 02:27:40,690
$500 Roonies.

3561
02:27:40,690 --> 02:27:41,950
That's what I need.

3562
02:27:42,510 --> 02:27:44,370
Not the Exodia.

3563
02:27:44,850 --> 02:27:46,970
Back to the street.

3564
02:27:48,890 --> 02:27:50,290
This is it.

3565
02:27:50,330 --> 02:27:50,870
Bye.

3566
02:27:51,830 --> 02:27:52,410
This is it.

3567
02:27:54,710 --> 02:27:55,510
Come on.

3568
02:27:55,590 --> 02:27:57,230
Where is it?

3569
02:27:58,630 --> 02:28:00,810
There has to be...

3570
02:28:00,810 --> 02:28:03,890
There has to be a $500 card.

3571
02:28:04,050 --> 02:28:05,950
It's still not sold yet?

3572
02:28:08,690 --> 02:28:09,590
How is it...

3573
02:28:09,590 --> 02:28:13,410
It's actually still not sold yet.

3574
02:28:13,510 --> 02:28:15,890
It's still just sitting there.

3575
02:28:18,470 --> 02:28:22,990
It's literally just sitting there unsold and unloved.

3576
02:28:23,310 --> 02:28:24,910
Because that's what it deserved.

3577
02:28:25,150 --> 02:28:25,910
I told you.

3578
02:28:26,030 --> 02:28:26,870
They know...

3579
02:28:26,870 --> 02:28:27,570
Yeah, exactly.

3580
02:28:27,690 --> 02:28:28,650
They know it's garbage.

3581
02:28:28,790 --> 02:28:29,710
They fucking know.

3582
02:28:30,830 --> 02:28:32,630
They think it's fake.

3583
02:28:33,490 --> 02:28:36,850
Out of all the other cards that are like reasonably priced.

3584
02:28:37,090 --> 02:28:40,770
They're like, why is there a 0.01 set?

3585
02:28:44,790 --> 02:28:45,870
She put the card in the wrong place.

3586
02:28:45,870 --> 02:28:47,770
She put the used receipt in it.

3587
02:28:48,950 --> 02:28:50,350
They're like, there's no way.

3588
02:28:50,470 --> 02:28:51,190
There's no way.

3589
02:28:51,290 --> 02:28:52,690
That card is just one cent.

3590
02:28:52,970 --> 02:28:53,850
Like, is that...

3591
02:28:53,850 --> 02:28:56,030
Is that an April Fool's prank?

3592
02:28:58,750 --> 02:29:02,550
I have never been so salty over a cake.

3593
02:29:02,950 --> 02:29:03,570
Oh my god.

3594
02:29:03,590 --> 02:29:04,490
It finally sold.

3595
02:29:05,710 --> 02:29:07,830
It is the guy that's stinky.

3596
02:29:09,310 --> 02:29:10,430
Of course.

3597
02:29:10,530 --> 02:29:11,690
Of course, Eva.

3598
02:29:13,950 --> 02:29:15,570
He's going to resell it.

3599
02:29:15,610 --> 02:29:15,850
He's going to resell it.

3600
02:29:16,730 --> 02:29:21,490
He's like, he's like, he's like this card shop owner from down the street.

3601
02:29:21,630 --> 02:29:24,490
And he knows my dark history.

3602
02:29:24,770 --> 02:29:26,770
He knows my secret.

3603
02:29:29,930 --> 02:29:32,030
He knows my secret.

3604
02:29:32,150 --> 02:29:33,990
He knows this isn't a joke anymore.

3605
02:29:35,610 --> 02:29:40,290
He's going to sell it in his store for the actual price.

3606
02:29:42,930 --> 02:29:43,770
All right.

3607
02:29:43,870 --> 02:29:44,210
Okay.

3608
02:29:44,970 --> 02:29:44,990
Okay.

3609
02:29:44,990 --> 02:29:45,290
Okay.

3610
02:29:45,290 --> 02:29:45,330
Okay.

3611
02:29:46,350 --> 02:29:48,070
Let's see, $57.

3612
02:29:49,190 --> 02:29:49,630
0.

3613
02:29:49,670 --> 02:29:50,810
Oh my god, that's a lot!

3614
02:29:50,890 --> 02:29:52,950
What are you going to do with all that dice, my dude?

3615
02:29:56,010 --> 02:29:57,130
Oh my god.

3616
02:29:57,230 --> 02:29:57,850
This is it.

3617
02:30:00,270 --> 02:30:01,570
Oh my god, thank God.

3618
02:30:01,710 --> 02:30:01,930
Okay.

3619
02:30:01,990 --> 02:30:03,010
I just need a hundred dollars.

3620
02:30:03,810 --> 02:30:04,770
Guys, this is it.

3621
02:30:05,830 --> 02:30:09,250
And then I can finally get rid of the fucking peasant boxes.

3622
02:30:09,650 --> 02:30:15,830
I can finally get rid of these peasant boxes.

3623
02:30:15,850 --> 02:30:20,510
These boxes don't give me the same thrill anymore.

3624
02:30:25,650 --> 02:30:28,970
That's right, you only open packs to sell cards.

3625
02:30:29,250 --> 02:30:29,730
Exactly!

3626
02:30:30,270 --> 02:30:32,590
It's a long-term investment chat!

3627
02:30:33,070 --> 02:30:35,090
I need to pay off my loans!

3628
02:30:36,550 --> 02:30:37,270
Guys...

3629
02:30:39,570 --> 02:30:43,270
If only we had a card to cover...

3630
02:30:44,530 --> 02:30:45,770
Guys, it's okay.

3631
02:30:45,950 --> 02:30:47,530
We're gonna get $500.

3632
02:30:47,550 --> 02:30:49,290
It's gonna save us on the last day.

3633
02:30:49,350 --> 02:30:52,890
That $500 is gonna save us on the last day.

3634
02:30:53,250 --> 02:30:56,070
We're gonna get somebody that's gonna buy the $500.

3635
02:30:56,410 --> 02:30:57,610
Guys, just believe.

3636
02:31:00,030 --> 02:31:01,130
Just believe, guys.

3637
02:31:01,970 --> 02:31:03,570
It's gonna happen.

3638
02:31:07,980 --> 02:31:08,580
$21?

3639
02:31:08,580 --> 02:31:09,460
Come on.

3640
02:31:09,520 --> 02:31:13,120
I have a $500 card right there.

3641
02:31:14,940 --> 02:31:15,500
Oh, wait.

3642
02:31:17,380 --> 02:31:18,180
Alright, 10%.

3643
02:31:18,180 --> 02:31:19,260
Okay, I sold this before.

3644
02:31:19,360 --> 02:31:20,100
I was like, wait a minute.

3645
02:31:20,260 --> 02:31:21,500
I have like three of them.

3646
02:31:22,760 --> 02:31:26,120
I have like three of that fucking card right there.

3647
02:31:26,600 --> 02:31:28,040
Wait, I think I almost...

3648
02:31:28,040 --> 02:31:28,520
Wait.

3649
02:31:29,020 --> 02:31:29,820
Okay, leave.

3650
02:31:30,460 --> 02:31:31,080
Okay, good.

3651
02:31:31,300 --> 02:31:32,800
Okay, now...

3652
02:31:32,800 --> 02:31:33,360
Whoops.

3653
02:31:35,020 --> 02:31:36,140
Good, I kicked them out.

3654
02:31:36,200 --> 02:31:37,000
That's what I wanted.

3655
02:31:37,100 --> 02:31:39,860
By kicking them out, I can finally...

3656
02:31:40,300 --> 02:31:43,000
I can finally buy what I'm truly passionate about.

3657
02:31:44,740 --> 02:31:49,120
I stopped their game mid-game.

3658
02:31:49,220 --> 02:31:50,000
Just like that.

3659
02:31:50,300 --> 02:31:51,160
Oh, my.

3660
02:31:51,260 --> 02:31:54,320
Get these peasant boxes out of here.

3661
02:31:55,140 --> 02:32:00,780
Get these peasant basic cards out of here.

3662
02:32:01,520 --> 02:32:03,720
I don't need this anymore.

3663
02:32:03,960 --> 02:32:04,900
Wait, what is this?

3664
02:32:05,460 --> 02:32:06,440
Oh, it's these.

3665
02:32:06,640 --> 02:32:06,960
Okay.

3666
02:32:09,640 --> 02:32:11,040
The box corner.

3667
02:32:12,760 --> 02:32:13,400
Okay.

3668
02:32:13,400 --> 02:32:14,440
No, this is precious.

3669
02:32:14,880 --> 02:32:16,380
And then I gotta...

3670
02:32:16,380 --> 02:32:20,080
Okay, get these basic-ass cards out of here.

3671
02:32:20,100 --> 02:32:20,740
Wait, what is this?

3672
02:32:21,520 --> 02:32:22,740
Oh, they're these cards.

3673
02:32:22,860 --> 02:32:23,120
Okay.

3674
02:32:24,160 --> 02:32:24,640
Alright.

3675
02:32:24,920 --> 02:32:25,700
Here you go.

3676
02:32:27,460 --> 02:32:28,080
Oh, wait.

3677
02:32:28,200 --> 02:32:29,320
Oh, I can't mix them.

3678
02:32:29,420 --> 02:32:31,940
Can't mix trash with my actual good shit.

3679
02:32:32,140 --> 02:32:33,920
Get this trash out of here.

3680
02:32:34,620 --> 02:32:36,640
Get this trash out of here.

3681
02:32:37,320 --> 02:32:38,780
Get it out of here.

3682
02:32:40,700 --> 02:32:41,660
Ugh, disgusting.

3683
02:32:43,400 --> 02:32:43,640
Ugh!

3684
02:32:44,120 --> 02:32:45,460
Alright, that's...

3685
02:32:45,460 --> 02:32:47,360
That's my good box right here.

3686
02:32:51,980 --> 02:32:52,860
That's all the...

3687
02:32:52,860 --> 02:32:54,520
That's where my good boxes go.

3688
02:32:56,320 --> 02:32:57,340
Okay, let's see.

3689
02:32:57,840 --> 02:32:58,360
Idiot.

3690
02:33:00,200 --> 02:33:01,000
There we go.

3691
02:33:02,020 --> 02:33:02,860
There we go.

3692
02:33:04,260 --> 02:33:05,300
Oh, shit.

3693
02:33:05,400 --> 02:33:07,220
I need to buy more of those plushies.

3694
02:33:09,700 --> 02:33:10,220
Idiot.

3695
02:33:10,420 --> 02:33:10,940
Two...

3696
02:33:10,940 --> 02:33:11,020
Oh.

3697
02:33:13,020 --> 02:33:13,460
Okay.

3698
02:33:13,800 --> 02:33:15,820
I need to buy dice and the plushies.

3699
02:33:15,900 --> 02:33:16,460
Give me a sec.

3700
02:33:17,120 --> 02:33:19,800
Sorry, I keep going outside to buy this because I have...

3701
02:33:19,800 --> 02:33:20,580
I need better reception.

3702
02:33:20,980 --> 02:33:27,740
I go outside because I need better reception, guys.

3703
02:33:29,140 --> 02:33:30,380
Alright, and then dice.

3704
02:33:33,120 --> 02:33:34,240
Oh, I need 300?

3705
02:33:34,520 --> 02:33:35,260
What the fuck?

3706
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:35,660
How much?

3707
02:33:35,720 --> 02:33:36,020
Oh, yeah.

3708
02:33:36,040 --> 02:33:38,080
The dice is like 282.

3709
02:33:38,080 --> 02:33:39,740
I forgot about that.

3710
02:33:41,340 --> 02:33:44,980
Seven dollars and 91 cent.

3711
02:33:46,840 --> 02:33:47,600
Here we go.

3712
02:33:47,720 --> 02:33:48,240
Wait, how...

3713
02:33:48,240 --> 02:33:48,640
When...

3714
02:33:50,660 --> 02:33:51,960
It's a plushy store.

3715
02:33:52,140 --> 02:33:52,400
Yeah!

3716
02:33:52,820 --> 02:33:54,440
It's a plushy store.

3717
02:33:55,500 --> 02:33:56,500
I have two days.

3718
02:33:56,580 --> 02:33:57,140
That's fine.

3719
02:33:57,340 --> 02:33:58,780
Two days is more than enough day.

3720
02:33:58,960 --> 02:34:00,100
Wait, I have dice still?

3721
02:34:00,580 --> 02:34:01,060
Wait, no.

3722
02:34:01,080 --> 02:34:01,680
This is garbage.

3723
02:34:02,760 --> 02:34:03,240
Garbage.

3724
02:34:05,060 --> 02:34:05,920
Garbage corner.

3725
02:34:06,440 --> 02:34:07,220
Wait, I do?

3726
02:34:08,700 --> 02:34:09,100
This?

3727
02:34:10,720 --> 02:34:11,760
Which one is it?

3728
02:34:12,820 --> 02:34:13,640
Oh, there it is.

3729
02:34:13,720 --> 02:34:14,520
Oh, I do have more.

3730
02:34:14,600 --> 02:34:14,840
Nice.

3731
02:34:16,180 --> 02:34:16,580
Nice.

3732
02:34:16,660 --> 02:34:16,880
Okay.

3733
02:34:17,900 --> 02:34:18,500
That's good.

3734
02:34:19,080 --> 02:34:20,380
I do have more space.

3735
02:34:20,460 --> 02:34:20,700
Okay.

3736
02:34:20,820 --> 02:34:21,720
And then we're going to pop...

3737
02:34:21,720 --> 02:34:22,920
Put another card in here.

3738
02:34:24,720 --> 02:34:25,440
Oh, shit.

3739
02:34:27,240 --> 02:34:28,040
14 dollars.

3740
02:34:29,240 --> 02:34:29,940
There we go.

3741
02:34:30,320 --> 02:34:31,740
Oh, he bought dice too!

3742
02:34:34,080 --> 02:34:34,880
Five, six...

3743
02:34:36,580 --> 02:34:37,200
Oh, shit.

3744
02:34:37,220 --> 02:34:37,900
Oh, shit.

3745
02:34:39,820 --> 02:34:40,840
Okay, nice.

3746
02:34:41,020 --> 02:34:42,320
Okay, now my true passion.

3747
02:34:43,280 --> 02:34:44,740
Now I finally have time.

3748
02:34:44,980 --> 02:34:46,760
Wait, how much is it to hire an employee?

3749
02:34:49,240 --> 02:34:49,760
No.

3750
02:34:52,220 --> 02:34:53,700
$500 processing fee?

3751
02:34:53,880 --> 02:34:57,320
I need $500 to hire Zett Cole?

3752
02:34:57,920 --> 02:34:59,440
Bro, you work in high...

3753
02:34:59,440 --> 02:35:00,360
You're in high school!

3754
02:35:03,280 --> 02:35:06,840
Why the fuck do I need $500 deposit for you?

3755
02:35:06,940 --> 02:35:07,200
Why?

3756
02:35:07,200 --> 02:35:07,960
Oh, it doesn't matter.

3757
02:35:08,040 --> 02:35:08,520
This is rare.

3758
02:35:08,960 --> 02:35:10,400
This is the true passion.

3759
02:35:11,660 --> 02:35:12,520
Right here.

3760
02:35:13,060 --> 02:35:13,660
Finally.

3761
02:35:15,020 --> 02:35:17,900
Finally, I can buy something I truly...

3762
02:35:17,900 --> 02:35:19,340
Cole is awful.

3763
02:35:20,340 --> 02:35:24,300
I can't believe Cole would like, scam me like this!

3764
02:35:25,920 --> 02:35:27,660
For one day!

3765
02:35:27,780 --> 02:35:30,220
I need to pay Cole $500!

3766
02:35:32,560 --> 02:35:33,160
Nothing.

3767
02:35:33,380 --> 02:35:34,740
That's nothing to me.

3768
02:35:37,980 --> 02:35:40,740
It should be $500 of store credit!

3769
02:35:41,420 --> 02:35:42,740
That's what it should be!

3770
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:50,740
Alright, 98 cents.

3771
02:35:54,760 --> 02:35:55,240
Okay.

3772
02:35:59,140 --> 02:36:00,180
What do I...

3773
02:36:00,180 --> 02:36:02,100
Wait, I need to buy...

3774
02:36:02,820 --> 02:36:05,180
I need $392, so...

3775
02:36:05,180 --> 02:36:05,460
Oh wait, no.

3776
02:36:05,520 --> 02:36:06,560
I have enough plush.

3777
02:36:06,640 --> 02:36:08,000
I have enough, so I can just...

3778
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:08,540
I can just...

3779
02:36:08,560 --> 02:36:09,340
I don't need dice, actually.

3780
02:36:09,420 --> 02:36:10,260
I just need plushies.

3781
02:36:10,360 --> 02:36:11,380
From my plushy store.

3782
02:36:13,340 --> 02:36:15,720
Guys, somebody will buy, like, the last...

3783
02:36:15,720 --> 02:36:16,600
Guys, trust me.

3784
02:36:16,960 --> 02:36:18,860
This is... This will work, guys.

3785
02:36:19,180 --> 02:36:19,980
Trust me.

3786
02:36:22,140 --> 02:36:22,640
See?

3787
02:36:22,800 --> 02:36:23,920
They're buying my rare packs.

3788
02:36:26,420 --> 02:36:27,420
Guys, tomorrow...

3789
02:36:27,420 --> 02:36:29,420
Tomorrow's where I'm gonna make it big, guys.

3790
02:36:29,440 --> 02:36:30,240
Tomorrow, I'll...

3791
02:36:30,240 --> 02:36:31,600
I'll be able to pay my bills.

3792
02:36:34,560 --> 02:36:38,100
Tomorrow, all these cards!

3793
02:36:38,100 --> 02:36:39,840
Will be sold, chat.

3794
02:36:40,080 --> 02:36:40,840
Tomorrow.

3795
02:36:41,140 --> 02:36:42,760
It's gonna be tomorrow.

3796
02:36:42,820 --> 02:36:44,020
Where things...

3797
02:36:44,020 --> 02:36:45,420
Where the magic happens.

3798
02:36:45,820 --> 02:36:46,480
Guys...

3799
02:36:49,080 --> 02:36:51,540
Tomorrow is where the magic happens!

3800
02:36:51,720 --> 02:36:52,740
You don't under...

3801
02:36:52,740 --> 02:36:53,680
Just trust...

3802
02:36:53,680 --> 02:36:54,880
Trust the process!

3803
02:36:56,880 --> 02:36:58,820
Trust the process, chat.

3804
02:37:01,040 --> 02:37:04,200
I'll make, like, $500 tomorrow.

3805
02:37:04,200 --> 02:37:04,700
Tomorrow!

3806
02:37:09,850 --> 02:37:11,630
Tomorrow, we'll discover...

3807
02:37:11,630 --> 02:37:13,810
Tomorrow is where we're gonna hit it big!

3808
02:37:19,150 --> 02:37:19,830
Let's see.

3809
02:37:19,990 --> 02:37:22,110
33.02.

3810
02:37:23,670 --> 02:37:24,610
Okay, guys.

3811
02:37:24,790 --> 02:37:25,170
Guys.

3812
02:37:25,530 --> 02:37:26,050
Leave.

3813
02:37:26,250 --> 02:37:27,310
I need to start tomorrow.

3814
02:37:28,030 --> 02:37:29,210
I need to...

3815
02:37:31,330 --> 02:37:32,990
I need to start tomorrow.

3816
02:37:33,070 --> 02:37:33,970
I need you to leave.

3817
02:37:34,610 --> 02:37:35,210
I need you to leave.

3818
02:37:36,090 --> 02:37:36,990
I need you to leave.

3819
02:37:36,990 --> 02:37:37,910
You guys still bought those packs.

3820
02:37:39,310 --> 02:37:41,870
You might say they're expensive, but you didn't quit.

3821
02:37:42,450 --> 02:37:43,890
You didn't fucking quit.

3822
02:37:46,050 --> 02:37:46,570
Alright.

3823
02:37:49,070 --> 02:37:49,890
This is it.

3824
02:37:50,530 --> 02:37:52,230
This is where the magic happens.

3825
02:37:52,250 --> 02:37:53,510
Right here, chat.

3826
02:37:53,690 --> 02:37:57,130
This is exactly when my luck turns around.

3827
02:37:57,690 --> 02:37:58,630
Right here.

3828
02:38:00,070 --> 02:38:01,050
For these cards.

3829
02:38:03,570 --> 02:38:05,030
No, I'm not talking about the store.

3830
02:38:05,090 --> 02:38:06,030
I'm talking about my card luck.

3831
02:38:06,210 --> 02:38:06,970
This is where the luck turns around right here.

3832
02:38:06,970 --> 02:38:08,510
This is where my luck will turn around.

3833
02:38:08,830 --> 02:38:09,870
For my cards.

3834
02:38:20,090 --> 02:38:21,290
Here it is.

3835
02:38:25,210 --> 02:38:26,390
We're gonna grab it.

3836
02:38:26,410 --> 02:38:27,050
We're gonna get that.

3837
02:38:27,130 --> 02:38:28,470
We're gonna get that full art.

3838
02:38:28,710 --> 02:38:29,190
Exactly!

3839
02:38:30,450 --> 02:38:31,790
Exactly, Mr. ReapN.

3840
02:38:32,150 --> 02:38:34,130
This is where we get the full art.

3841
02:38:34,350 --> 02:38:37,110
The full art that's worth a thousand dollars.

3842
02:38:37,190 --> 02:38:38,050
This is it.

3843
02:38:38,630 --> 02:38:39,470
Today's the day.

3844
02:38:40,610 --> 02:38:41,610
Today's the day.

3845
02:38:43,430 --> 02:38:45,550
We're gonna get that thousand dollar card.

3846
02:38:46,510 --> 02:38:47,830
And just to be sure.

3847
02:38:47,970 --> 02:38:48,910
Just to be sure.

3848
02:38:48,930 --> 02:38:49,830
I'm gonna buy another box.

3849
02:38:50,010 --> 02:38:50,650
Just to be sure.

3850
02:38:50,910 --> 02:38:53,190
Just to be sure I actually hit that.

3851
02:38:54,270 --> 02:38:55,370
I just gotta be sure.

3852
02:38:55,530 --> 02:38:55,890
Don't worry.

3853
02:38:55,970 --> 02:38:56,790
I'm gonna make... Don't worry.

3854
02:38:56,850 --> 02:38:57,690
I'll have enough for bills.

3855
02:38:57,890 --> 02:38:58,770
Today's the last day.

3856
02:38:58,850 --> 02:38:59,370
It'll be fine.

3857
02:38:59,930 --> 02:39:00,730
It's my corner.

3858
02:39:02,430 --> 02:39:05,810
My plushies... My plushie business is going great, if you're wondering.

3859
02:39:08,630 --> 02:39:09,530
Oh, that's not it.

3860
02:39:13,100 --> 02:39:16,080
My plushie store is doing absolutely wonderful.

3861
02:39:20,290 --> 02:39:23,470
Please, you haven't eaten and showered in days!

3862
02:39:24,650 --> 02:39:25,810
You don't understand.

3863
02:39:25,990 --> 02:39:27,430
You don't understand my passion.

3864
02:39:30,730 --> 02:39:35,510
If you cared about me, you wouldn't want me to get that full art!

3865
02:39:35,970 --> 02:39:38,550
If you actually cared about me!

3866
02:39:46,950 --> 02:39:49,690
The plushie store is doing fine.

3867
02:39:49,890 --> 02:39:52,370
The cards are, however...

3868
02:39:53,250 --> 02:39:54,170
This is it.

3869
02:39:54,230 --> 02:39:54,770
This is it.

3870
02:39:55,130 --> 02:39:56,890
This is where my luck changes.

3871
02:39:56,910 --> 02:39:57,490
Right here.

3872
02:39:58,550 --> 02:40:00,950
I will miss the for-profit.

3873
02:40:01,970 --> 02:40:07,630
I'll miss when she cared about us making money.

3874
02:40:07,730 --> 02:40:08,970
Not the cards.

3875
02:40:09,550 --> 02:40:10,150
Not...

3876
02:40:13,930 --> 02:40:14,790
Come on.

3877
02:40:15,930 --> 02:40:18,850
There has to be... has to be one of them.

3878
02:40:19,930 --> 02:40:20,910
Come on.

3879
02:40:20,930 --> 02:40:21,990
Where is it?

3880
02:40:22,450 --> 02:40:23,490
Where is it?

3881
02:40:25,090 --> 02:40:25,810
It's okay.

3882
02:40:26,450 --> 02:40:27,750
We can make it back.

3883
02:40:28,590 --> 02:40:30,510
We can make it back so easily.

3884
02:40:33,390 --> 02:40:35,790
Fourteen... Fourteen point twenty-one.

3885
02:40:36,470 --> 02:40:38,850
I have to do like this.

3886
02:40:40,570 --> 02:40:41,090
Three...

3887
02:40:42,010 --> 02:40:43,950
One, two, three, four, five, six.

3888
02:40:44,250 --> 02:40:45,930
Oh, I could have just... I could have...

3889
02:40:49,670 --> 02:40:51,090
Three, two... Oh, wait.

3890
02:40:53,570 --> 02:40:54,050
Okay.

3891
02:40:54,730 --> 02:40:55,770
Oh my god!

3892
02:40:56,010 --> 02:40:56,710
That's enough!

3893
02:40:56,930 --> 02:40:57,610
That's enough!

3894
02:40:58,130 --> 02:41:00,290
To buy another box of cards.

3895
02:41:01,630 --> 02:41:03,630
To buy two boxes of cards.

3896
02:41:03,910 --> 02:41:05,090
That's just enough.

3897
02:41:06,310 --> 02:41:06,790
That's...

3898
02:41:11,330 --> 02:41:13,370
Guys, it's only 11 a.m.

3899
02:41:13,370 --> 02:41:14,510
I have plenty of time.

3900
02:41:15,310 --> 02:41:17,670
Guys, I have so much time.

3901
02:41:17,730 --> 02:41:19,250
You don't understand.

3902
02:41:21,530 --> 02:41:23,750
I have so much time.

3903
02:41:23,850 --> 02:41:24,450
It's okay.

3904
02:41:28,130 --> 02:41:29,550
There's so much time.

3905
02:41:30,170 --> 02:41:32,210
Get that art out of here.

3906
02:41:32,390 --> 02:41:35,950
If it's not holographic full art, it's nothing to me.

3907
02:41:35,950 --> 02:41:37,570
It's fucking nothing.

3908
02:41:39,690 --> 02:41:41,910
It might as well be two weeks.

3909
02:41:42,090 --> 02:41:42,670
Exactly.

3910
02:41:45,350 --> 02:41:46,170
Come on.

3911
02:41:48,850 --> 02:41:49,750
It's okay.

3912
02:41:50,530 --> 02:41:51,370
It's okay.

3913
02:41:51,450 --> 02:41:54,390
That thousand dollar card, we're gonna hit it right here.

3914
02:41:55,830 --> 02:41:59,150
Just don't listen to those non-believers.

3915
02:41:59,230 --> 02:41:59,810
Exactly.

3916
02:42:02,470 --> 02:42:03,930
You don't believe.

3917
02:42:03,930 --> 02:42:04,350
You don't believe.

3918
02:42:05,010 --> 02:42:05,790
Get out.

3919
02:42:05,930 --> 02:42:06,750
Get clean.

3920
02:42:07,590 --> 02:42:08,270
That's right.

3921
02:42:09,190 --> 02:42:11,850
Even when I'm opening boxes, I have my friends.

3922
02:42:13,230 --> 02:42:18,750
Even when opening boxes, I still know what's up.

3923
02:42:18,910 --> 02:42:20,590
I still get ready to spray.

3924
02:42:21,910 --> 02:42:22,430
Okay.

3925
02:42:22,450 --> 02:42:22,730
Nice.

3926
02:42:22,850 --> 02:42:23,050
Okay.

3927
02:42:24,930 --> 02:42:29,030
10, 13, 50, 60, 91.

3928
02:42:29,850 --> 02:42:30,490
There you go.

3929
02:42:30,790 --> 02:42:31,310
Okay.

3930
02:42:31,330 --> 02:42:32,250
How many cards sold?

3931
02:42:32,250 --> 02:42:32,870
Okay.

3932
02:42:32,990 --> 02:42:33,750
We'll put that here.

3933
02:42:34,750 --> 02:42:35,810
Put that here.

3934
02:42:36,950 --> 02:42:38,210
Then we'll put that here.

3935
02:42:40,410 --> 02:42:40,910
Okay.

3936
02:42:40,910 --> 02:42:41,410
Nice.

3937
02:42:41,930 --> 02:42:44,230
And then we'll sell this one.

3938
02:42:44,850 --> 02:42:46,290
And then we'll sell this one.

3939
02:42:47,850 --> 02:42:48,510
All right.

3940
02:42:48,570 --> 02:42:49,110
Oh, shit.

3941
02:42:49,150 --> 02:42:50,210
She bought three boxes.

3942
02:42:52,590 --> 02:42:53,410
Oh, my God.

3943
02:42:53,470 --> 02:42:54,090
That's enough.

3944
02:42:55,190 --> 02:42:56,230
That's just enough.

3945
02:42:59,050 --> 02:42:59,970
To buy more.

3946
02:43:00,290 --> 02:43:01,270
That's just enough.

3947
02:43:01,350 --> 02:43:01,510
Wait.

3948
02:43:01,510 --> 02:43:02,790
That's just enough.

3949
02:43:03,730 --> 02:43:04,690
That's just enough.

3950
02:43:05,850 --> 02:43:07,230
That's literally just enough.

3951
02:43:08,990 --> 02:43:09,670
Oh, wait.

3952
02:43:09,710 --> 02:43:10,770
No, I need $100 left.

3953
02:43:10,950 --> 02:43:11,150
Okay.

3954
02:43:15,270 --> 02:43:16,970
It's a higher call.

3955
02:43:21,250 --> 02:43:22,190
No, it's okay.

3956
02:43:22,670 --> 02:43:23,970
I can buy one more.

3957
02:43:24,150 --> 02:43:25,110
Just one more.

3958
02:43:25,150 --> 02:43:25,990
Guys, this box.

3959
02:43:26,450 --> 02:43:27,470
Guys, this box.

3960
02:43:27,850 --> 02:43:28,690
This is it.

3961
02:43:28,690 --> 02:43:29,550
This is the box.

3962
02:43:30,170 --> 02:43:33,230
This is the box where I'm going to get that $1,000 card.

3963
02:43:33,310 --> 02:43:33,870
This is it.

3964
02:43:33,930 --> 02:43:35,770
Guys, this is that box.

3965
02:43:37,650 --> 02:43:39,110
Just one more.

3966
02:43:43,090 --> 02:43:45,730
Guys, I have seven more hours.

3967
02:43:45,770 --> 02:43:46,690
It's fine.

3968
02:43:48,590 --> 02:43:50,670
Seven more hours, chat.

3969
02:43:52,250 --> 02:43:53,470
Seven more hours.

3970
02:43:53,530 --> 02:43:55,910
I can keep buying cards for seven more hours.

3971
02:43:55,910 --> 02:43:57,130
Trust it.

3972
02:43:57,210 --> 02:43:58,270
Trust the process.

3973
02:44:00,490 --> 02:44:02,270
Just seven more hours.

3974
02:44:07,450 --> 02:44:08,310
That's a lot.

3975
02:44:08,370 --> 02:44:08,830
Exactly.

3976
02:44:08,830 --> 02:44:11,150
That's so many hours, chat.

3977
02:44:11,450 --> 02:44:14,330
That's so many hours to open packs.

3978
02:44:16,070 --> 02:44:17,010
Right here.

3979
02:44:19,030 --> 02:44:20,070
Trust it.

3980
02:44:20,110 --> 02:44:20,450
Trust it.

3981
02:44:20,470 --> 02:44:21,310
I'm going to get $1,000.

3982
02:44:21,610 --> 02:44:25,730
And then we don't have to worry about bills for the rest of our lives.

3983
02:44:25,730 --> 02:44:26,010
And then we don't have to worry about bills for the rest of our lives.

3984
02:44:31,240 --> 02:44:33,020
Not even $500.

3985
02:44:33,540 --> 02:44:35,640
Get that card away from me.

3986
02:44:35,800 --> 02:44:38,760
Get that card away from me.

3987
02:44:40,460 --> 02:44:42,540
Not even $500.

3988
02:44:43,120 --> 02:44:44,700
I'm a $500 gal.

3989
02:44:45,060 --> 02:44:47,900
I'm in the red money.

3990
02:44:48,100 --> 02:44:49,440
Might as well be trash.

3991
02:44:53,020 --> 02:44:57,760
Guys, don't make me go on eBay and buy a $500 Pokemon card and then rip it in half.

3992
02:44:57,800 --> 02:44:57,840
Guys, don't make me go on eBay and buy a $500 Pokemon card and then rip it in half.

3993
02:45:00,420 --> 02:45:07,340
No, buy a $447 equivalent Pokemon card and then I'll rip it.

3994
02:45:11,240 --> 02:45:12,220
Doki, no.

3995
02:45:12,980 --> 02:45:13,860
Doki, no.

3996
02:45:13,980 --> 02:45:15,760
This is a simulation, Doki.

3997
02:45:16,600 --> 02:45:18,780
Don't confuse it with the real life.

3998
02:45:20,860 --> 02:45:24,300
Doki, you're in a video game.

3999
02:45:24,400 --> 02:45:26,580
Don't confuse it with real life.

4000
02:45:26,800 --> 02:45:27,600
Doki.

4001
02:45:33,760 --> 02:45:35,840
Oh, that's enough.

4002
02:45:36,300 --> 02:45:37,460
That's enough.

4003
02:45:43,070 --> 02:45:45,590
Just enough to hire Cole.

4004
02:45:45,750 --> 02:45:46,110
Let's go.

4005
02:45:46,490 --> 02:45:50,770
Hire Cole and buy another box.

4006
02:45:52,170 --> 02:45:54,190
Buy another box.

4007
02:45:54,450 --> 02:45:54,870
Let's go.

4008
02:45:56,430 --> 02:45:57,390
Oh my god.

4009
02:45:57,410 --> 02:45:59,210
Now that Cole works here.

4010
02:46:00,030 --> 02:46:00,810
Where's Cole?

4011
02:46:02,990 --> 02:46:04,090
Where is he?

4012
02:46:05,990 --> 02:46:07,670
Where the fuck is Cole?

4013
02:46:07,850 --> 02:46:10,090
Where is this teenager I hired?

4014
02:46:15,640 --> 02:46:16,660
Is that him?

4015
02:46:22,660 --> 02:46:23,220
Customers!

4016
02:46:28,140 --> 02:46:30,620
Doki, he literally just got out of school.

4017
02:46:30,620 --> 02:46:33,340
Get over there right now, Cole!

4018
02:46:33,660 --> 02:46:34,020
Fucking

4019
02:46:37,310 --> 02:46:37,850
cards!

4020
02:46:38,610 --> 02:46:41,350
Why are you fucking exclamation pointing me right now?

4021
02:46:44,030 --> 02:46:45,750
I'm here to open cards!

4022
02:46:46,590 --> 02:46:48,030
Get it together, Cole!

4023
02:46:48,830 --> 02:46:50,150
Get your...

4024
02:46:50,990 --> 02:46:51,670
Cole,

4025
02:46:56,470 --> 02:46:58,390
get your fucking ass in my store.

4026
02:46:58,590 --> 02:47:01,210
I mean, I'm too busy opening cards.

4027
02:47:03,090 --> 02:47:04,490
Accept his quest.

4028
02:47:06,390 --> 02:47:09,870
His little fucking side quest right here.

4029
02:47:11,290 --> 02:47:13,630
I didn't train this child?

4030
02:47:14,550 --> 02:47:15,490
Cole, please.

4031
02:47:15,530 --> 02:47:17,570
We have three more hours left in my store.

4032
02:47:17,830 --> 02:47:20,010
Cole, I need you to do your work.

4033
02:47:20,250 --> 02:47:21,650
Okay, man counters.

4034
02:47:21,990 --> 02:47:23,850
No, don't you dare touch my stock.

4035
02:47:24,510 --> 02:47:26,630
Don't you fucking dare touch this stock.

4036
02:47:27,270 --> 02:47:29,390
Okay, I need to put another card down.

4037
02:47:30,890 --> 02:47:31,810
All right.

4038
02:47:31,910 --> 02:47:33,110
I told you.

4039
02:47:34,310 --> 02:47:36,350
I told you, guys.

4040
02:47:36,530 --> 02:47:38,110
I fucking told you.

4041
02:47:38,250 --> 02:47:40,050
Now all I can...

4042
02:47:40,050 --> 02:47:42,710
Now all I can do is do what I...

4043
02:47:43,110 --> 02:47:44,690
Now this is the entire stream.

4044
02:47:50,090 --> 02:47:53,390
Now the real stream starts, chat.

4045
02:47:53,710 --> 02:47:55,990
This is the real stream.

4046
02:47:56,250 --> 02:47:58,470
This is the real stream.

4047
02:48:00,750 --> 02:48:03,490
This is the real stream.

4048
02:48:05,330 --> 02:48:07,110
We made it.

4049
02:48:07,250 --> 02:48:11,190
Also, I realize like three hours has passed now.

4050
02:48:11,370 --> 02:48:13,330
But like I hope the volume...

4051
02:48:13,330 --> 02:48:14,130
The game...

4052
02:48:14,130 --> 02:48:17,190
I hope the game volume wasn't too loud.

4053
02:48:17,750 --> 02:48:18,490
I know...

4054
02:48:18,490 --> 02:48:20,510
I know I shouldn't have asked earlier.

4055
02:48:21,070 --> 02:48:22,830
But I was very committed.

4056
02:48:23,530 --> 02:48:24,570
Oh, shit.

4057
02:48:24,770 --> 02:48:25,350
Sorry.

4058
02:48:26,610 --> 02:48:29,890
Guys, my phone was ringing and I'm too busy.

4059
02:48:30,170 --> 02:48:30,890
I...

4060
02:48:30,890 --> 02:48:33,730
The BGM was kind of loud.

4061
02:48:33,850 --> 02:48:34,850
You told me now.

4062
02:48:35,510 --> 02:48:36,810
Oh, no.

4063
02:48:42,870 --> 02:48:44,270
Oh, no.

4064
02:48:44,430 --> 02:48:46,110
For three hours.

4065
02:48:46,650 --> 02:48:48,850
For three hours.

4066
02:48:50,690 --> 02:48:52,410
Oh, my God.

4067
02:48:54,030 --> 02:48:55,430
Oh, my God.

4068
02:48:56,290 --> 02:48:56,990
Oh, my God.

4069
02:48:56,990 --> 02:48:57,750
Oh, it was loud.

4070
02:48:58,010 --> 02:48:59,350
Oh, my God.

4071
02:48:59,630 --> 02:49:00,630
I can't...

4072
02:49:00,630 --> 02:49:02,910
Sorry, I have a voicemail playing right now.

4073
02:49:03,170 --> 02:49:04,370
I did not...

4074
02:49:04,370 --> 02:49:05,790
I'm not taking the phone call.

4075
02:49:11,770 --> 02:49:12,250
Sorry,

4076
02:49:16,890 --> 02:49:19,090
there's a voicemail that's going on right now.

4077
02:49:19,190 --> 02:49:21,470
But I didn't take the call because this is much more important.

4078
02:49:21,470 --> 02:49:22,030
Guys!

4079
02:49:23,070 --> 02:49:24,230
I knew it.

4080
02:49:25,070 --> 02:49:26,470
You don't stop.

4081
02:49:27,270 --> 02:49:28,690
You don't stop.

4082
02:49:29,170 --> 02:49:30,550
You don't stop.

4083
02:49:30,690 --> 02:49:33,170
Guys, how long is this fucking voicemail?

4084
02:49:33,430 --> 02:49:34,310
It's still...

4085
02:49:34,310 --> 02:49:36,570
This guy is still voicemailing.

4086
02:49:37,230 --> 02:49:38,250
Is it done yet?

4087
02:49:38,750 --> 02:49:39,890
Oh, it's done.

4088
02:49:40,170 --> 02:49:40,810
Okay.

4089
02:49:41,070 --> 02:49:42,330
Okay, now I'm back.

4090
02:49:43,210 --> 02:49:44,290
I told you.

4091
02:49:44,510 --> 02:49:46,090
I told you.

4092
02:49:46,330 --> 02:49:47,890
I told you.

4093
02:49:47,970 --> 02:49:49,810
I fucking told...

4094
02:49:49,810 --> 02:49:53,270
$700 right here.

4095
02:49:53,390 --> 02:49:56,050
And we still have one more spray left.

4096
02:49:56,950 --> 02:49:58,630
I told you.

4097
02:49:59,830 --> 02:50:02,230
I fucking told you.

4098
02:50:02,270 --> 02:50:03,070
None of you.

4099
02:50:03,410 --> 02:50:06,070
None of you believed in me.

4100
02:50:06,890 --> 02:50:09,250
None of you.

4101
02:50:09,370 --> 02:50:10,730
I still have...

4102
02:50:10,730 --> 02:50:13,770
I still have time to do one more card opening.

4103
02:50:15,270 --> 02:50:16,590
I still have time.

4104
02:50:16,850 --> 02:50:18,230
Guys, I still have time.

4105
02:50:18,230 --> 02:50:21,190
I still have time to do one more card opening before I pay rent.

4106
02:50:21,370 --> 02:50:21,770
Guys.

4107
02:50:21,970 --> 02:50:22,690
No, no, no.

4108
02:50:22,710 --> 02:50:23,350
I still have time.

4109
02:50:23,470 --> 02:50:24,030
Guys, no, no, no.

4110
02:50:24,050 --> 02:50:24,870
I still have time.

4111
02:50:25,070 --> 02:50:25,870
I still...

4112
02:50:25,870 --> 02:50:28,970
I didn't change my sound setting, but I still have time.

4113
02:50:29,290 --> 02:50:29,690
I...

4114
02:50:30,790 --> 02:50:35,310
I know I should be changing my sound, but like I still have time.

4115
02:50:36,170 --> 02:50:36,570
It's...

4116
02:50:36,570 --> 02:50:37,810
I still have time.

4117
02:50:43,010 --> 02:50:43,630
It's okay.

4118
02:50:44,190 --> 02:50:44,750
It's okay.

4119
02:50:44,810 --> 02:50:45,530
10 more seconds.

4120
02:50:45,530 --> 02:50:46,850
10 seconds.

4121
02:50:46,850 --> 02:50:47,150
10 seconds.

4122
02:50:47,270 --> 02:50:47,690
It's okay.

4123
02:50:49,430 --> 02:50:51,130
I told you.

4124
02:50:52,890 --> 02:50:53,610
Bam.

4125
02:50:54,330 --> 02:50:56,070
Not even close.

4126
02:51:03,570 --> 02:51:07,570
Not even fucking close.

4127
02:51:08,310 --> 02:51:09,270
You know what?

4128
02:51:09,390 --> 02:51:10,590
That's beating the game.

4129
02:51:17,570 --> 02:51:19,870
You didn't believe in me, chat.

4130
02:51:21,370 --> 02:51:25,310
I told you to trust the process.

4131
02:51:25,690 --> 02:51:27,110
And look at that.

4132
02:51:28,270 --> 02:51:29,630
Look at that.

4133
02:51:33,410 --> 02:51:38,610
Look at that, my sexy x-rare foil.

4134
02:51:39,150 --> 02:51:40,870
You didn't believe.

4135
02:51:42,750 --> 02:51:45,530
Wouldn't it be funny if you can actually throw the cards?

4136
02:51:45,530 --> 02:51:45,950
I'll...

4137
02:51:47,010 --> 02:51:48,110
I'll throw that.

4138
02:51:51,210 --> 02:51:51,990
All right.

4139
02:51:53,290 --> 02:51:54,010
All right.

4140
02:51:55,330 --> 02:51:55,850
Now...

4141
02:51:55,850 --> 02:52:00,130
Now that I opened a $700 card, I think I can retire.

4142
02:52:00,470 --> 02:52:01,450
I think...

4143
02:52:02,690 --> 02:52:03,630
I'm ready.

4144
02:52:03,990 --> 02:52:05,650
Now I'm ready to retire.

4145
02:52:06,930 --> 02:52:07,830
I'm ready to...

4146
02:52:07,830 --> 02:52:10,330
I already peaked, so I'm ready to call it there.

4147
02:52:11,610 --> 02:52:13,630
Don't keep going to the list.

4148
02:52:13,650 --> 02:52:14,630
I can't go.

4149
02:52:16,250 --> 02:52:18,710
I was never almost homeless.

4150
02:52:18,830 --> 02:52:20,730
I trusted the process.

4151
02:52:21,270 --> 02:52:22,570
I knew what's up.

4152
02:52:23,910 --> 02:52:27,990
I knew that I was going to make it big.

4153
02:52:28,190 --> 02:52:29,050
I knew it.

4154
02:52:29,130 --> 02:52:29,990
I trusted.

4155
02:52:30,610 --> 02:52:33,290
But you didn't get that $1,000.

4156
02:52:33,730 --> 02:52:34,430
All right.

4157
02:52:34,530 --> 02:52:35,390
You know what?

4158
02:52:35,550 --> 02:52:36,410
All right, bet.

4159
02:52:36,650 --> 02:52:37,110
Bet.

4160
02:52:37,170 --> 02:52:38,150
Okay, give me a sec.

4161
02:52:38,210 --> 02:52:39,110
I'm opening the game again.

4162
02:52:39,190 --> 02:52:39,430
Bet.

4163
02:52:39,530 --> 02:52:40,050
All right.

4164
02:52:40,110 --> 02:52:41,030
Give me a sec.

4165
02:52:41,090 --> 02:52:42,070
I'm opening the game again.

4166
02:52:42,190 --> 02:52:43,870
I'm opening that game again.

4167
02:52:43,870 --> 02:52:44,810
You think we won't?

4168
02:52:44,810 --> 02:52:46,290
You want to fucking bet we won't?

4169
02:52:46,290 --> 02:52:47,070
Don't worry, guys.

4170
02:52:47,610 --> 02:52:48,330
Don't worry.

4171
02:52:48,450 --> 02:52:50,090
I will open the rest of those packs.

4172
02:52:54,150 --> 02:52:54,870
I'm back.

4173
02:52:55,790 --> 02:52:58,090
I'm back to not rigged 100%.

4174
02:52:58,090 --> 02:53:02,370
This corner, this box corner of stuff I have right here.

4175
02:53:02,970 --> 02:53:05,110
You want to bet we won't get this?

4176
02:53:06,710 --> 02:53:08,110
All right, here we go.

4177
02:53:10,490 --> 02:53:11,670
All right, wait.

4178
02:53:11,670 --> 02:53:14,410
Do we actually need to turn down the sound?

4179
02:53:14,590 --> 02:53:17,470
I actually don't know if people were trolling.

4180
02:53:17,610 --> 02:53:18,210
All right.

4181
02:53:21,910 --> 02:53:22,750
This is it.

4182
02:53:23,370 --> 02:53:26,090
We're going to open that $1,000 card right here.

4183
02:53:26,150 --> 02:53:26,850
It's in here.

4184
02:53:27,290 --> 02:53:28,310
It's in here.

4185
02:53:32,710 --> 02:53:34,710
We're going to turn this car around.

4186
02:53:35,050 --> 02:53:37,430
We're going to get that $1,000 card.

4187
02:53:37,810 --> 02:53:38,630
We're going to...

4188
02:53:41,550 --> 02:53:42,450
Right here.

4189
02:53:43,270 --> 02:53:44,390
This is where...

4190
02:53:44,390 --> 02:53:45,730
Don't talk to me.

4191
02:53:45,850 --> 02:53:47,730
We're here for the $1,000 card.

4192
02:53:49,890 --> 02:53:50,770
This is it.

4193
02:53:52,090 --> 02:53:53,330
This has to be it.

4194
02:53:53,790 --> 02:53:55,490
We have so many boxes.

4195
02:53:55,610 --> 02:53:56,550
We actually...

4196
02:53:57,910 --> 02:54:00,490
We're not even going to open the store.

4197
02:54:02,610 --> 02:54:05,770
All these people are like, when will the store open?

4198
02:54:05,910 --> 02:54:08,330
I'm just out here opening the card.

4199
02:54:09,210 --> 02:54:10,790
The Canva stream.

4200
02:54:11,330 --> 02:54:13,990
I don't even need to purchase new boxes, chat.

4201
02:54:15,690 --> 02:54:20,250
I don't even need to purchase new boxes because I know...

4202
02:54:20,250 --> 02:54:25,210
I know that in that box is where it is.

4203
02:54:25,490 --> 02:54:28,030
In that box is that...

4204
02:54:28,030 --> 02:54:32,990
In all those boxes that I have right now, it will be $1,000.

4205
02:54:34,630 --> 02:54:35,970
I can feel it.

4206
02:54:36,410 --> 02:54:37,770
I can feel it.

4207
02:54:38,870 --> 02:54:40,430
I can fucking feel it.

4208
02:54:40,490 --> 02:54:41,430
It's got to be in here.

4209
02:54:42,290 --> 02:54:44,230
It's got to be in here.

4210
02:54:44,430 --> 02:54:45,810
I have like five.

4211
02:54:45,950 --> 02:54:47,170
I have like 20 of these.

4212
02:54:48,150 --> 02:54:52,570
I think I have like at least 30 booster packs in the corner.

4213
02:54:56,150 --> 02:54:57,470
I'm pretty sure.

4214
02:54:57,870 --> 02:55:00,190
I'm pretty sure I have 30.

4215
02:55:00,250 --> 02:55:03,970
I have 30 booster packs in that fucking corner there.

4216
02:55:05,690 --> 02:55:07,170
It's going to be in it.

4217
02:55:08,070 --> 02:55:09,930
There's a 15K card.

4218
02:55:10,110 --> 02:55:12,870
What's the most expensive card you can pull, chat?

4219
02:55:13,770 --> 02:55:15,250
God, I don't care about that.

4220
02:55:15,570 --> 02:55:19,790
Don't give me a fucking sound effect for something that weak.

4221
02:55:21,950 --> 02:55:22,810
All right, this is it.

4222
02:55:23,050 --> 02:55:26,650
Open all the cards in the store.

4223
02:55:30,130 --> 02:55:32,770
My minimum wage worker is just here waiting.

4224
02:55:32,970 --> 02:55:35,270
He's just like, please, please.

4225
02:55:37,170 --> 02:55:38,590
Please, manager, please.

4226
02:55:39,790 --> 02:55:42,690
The time has stopped because...

4227
02:55:42,690 --> 02:55:45,510
Oh, the first one off the bat.

4228
02:55:45,750 --> 02:55:47,710
Too bad it's only $20 though.

4229
02:55:48,290 --> 02:55:49,550
Let him work.

4230
02:55:50,070 --> 02:55:52,630
He's like, please, please, manager.

4231
02:55:53,510 --> 02:55:55,450
Please, time stopped.

4232
02:55:56,170 --> 02:56:00,770
I thought I've been standing there for two hours, but it's still 8 a.m.

4233
02:56:03,510 --> 02:56:04,870
All right.

4234
02:56:05,620 --> 02:56:08,370
There has to be a thousand.

4235
02:56:08,510 --> 02:56:10,110
We must get a thousand dollars.

4236
02:56:11,800 --> 02:56:13,090
Thousand dollars or bust.

4237
02:56:14,750 --> 02:56:17,150
Thousand dollars or bust right here.

4238
02:56:18,930 --> 02:56:19,890
Where's my others?

4239
02:56:20,370 --> 02:56:21,270
Where is it?

4240
02:56:21,780 --> 02:56:22,710
Okay, I knew there's more.

4241
02:56:22,910 --> 02:56:24,230
I knew there's more.

4242
02:56:24,610 --> 02:56:27,150
No, we're not opening the store.

4243
02:56:27,290 --> 02:56:29,110
We don't need that money right now.

4244
02:56:29,270 --> 02:56:30,890
We don't need it.

4245
02:56:31,070 --> 02:56:33,410
We need that thousand dollar card.

4246
02:56:36,090 --> 02:56:39,550
Yeah, time's not moving, so he's not getting paid exactly.

4247
02:56:40,970 --> 02:56:41,930
Come on.

4248
02:56:42,210 --> 02:56:43,370
Where is it?

4249
02:56:44,170 --> 02:56:45,150
Where is it?

4250
02:56:47,810 --> 02:56:48,990
I don't have a problem.

4251
02:56:49,690 --> 02:56:50,990
I don't have a problem.

4252
02:56:51,050 --> 02:56:52,290
It has to be in this pack.

4253
02:56:52,430 --> 02:56:53,810
It has to be in it.

4254
02:56:57,690 --> 02:57:01,770
As long as I don't open the store, time has stopped.

4255
02:57:01,770 --> 02:57:04,210
I control the store.

4256
02:57:04,370 --> 02:57:05,890
I control the world's time.

4257
02:57:06,610 --> 02:57:10,070
The world revolves around this Tetramon store.

4258
02:57:15,490 --> 02:57:16,250
$8?

4259
02:57:16,250 --> 02:57:17,730
God, that's like...

4260
02:57:17,730 --> 02:57:19,450
That's like money for ants.

4261
02:57:19,810 --> 02:57:21,710
Even ants don't want that card.

4262
02:57:22,850 --> 02:57:26,230
What am I going to do with an $8 worth of cards?

4263
02:57:27,710 --> 02:57:29,010
0.18.

4264
02:57:30,130 --> 02:57:31,170
Come on.

4265
02:57:31,890 --> 02:57:32,830
Come on.

4266
02:57:32,830 --> 02:57:34,090
That thousand dollars.

4267
02:57:35,250 --> 02:57:38,070
I don't think she's going to the bank today.

4268
02:57:38,230 --> 02:57:41,430
I still have three more hours of closing time.

4269
02:57:41,570 --> 02:57:42,410
There's plenty of time.

4270
02:57:42,710 --> 02:57:44,090
There's still three more hours.

4271
02:57:44,230 --> 02:57:45,930
There's still three more hours of...

4272
02:57:45,930 --> 02:57:47,550
There's still three more hours, chat.

4273
02:57:47,710 --> 02:57:50,630
I still have three more hours left before the bank closed.

4274
02:57:50,690 --> 02:57:51,650
That's plenty of time.

4275
02:57:51,810 --> 02:57:53,570
That's so much time.

4276
02:57:53,850 --> 02:57:54,370
That's...

4277
02:57:58,690 --> 02:58:01,010
There's so much time.

4278
02:58:01,130 --> 02:58:01,630
We're fine.

4279
02:58:05,550 --> 02:58:07,890
I have three more hours.

4280
02:58:07,930 --> 02:58:08,410
We're fine.

4281
02:58:08,990 --> 02:58:12,310
And if I have two more hours, that's still plenty of time.

4282
02:58:12,470 --> 02:58:14,170
Two more hours of bank time.

4283
02:58:14,430 --> 02:58:16,350
That's so much time.

4284
02:58:20,090 --> 02:58:20,650
Okay.

4285
02:58:20,650 --> 02:58:20,830
Okay.

4286
02:58:23,050 --> 02:58:23,890
Come on.

4287
02:58:23,990 --> 02:58:24,690
Come on.

4288
02:58:24,690 --> 02:58:25,670
There has to be...

4289
02:58:25,670 --> 02:58:26,990
Wait, is that the last one?

4290
02:58:27,190 --> 02:58:27,690
It's okay.

4291
02:58:27,750 --> 02:58:29,270
I still have like two more boxes.

4292
02:58:29,370 --> 02:58:30,290
I still have like...

4293
02:58:30,290 --> 02:58:33,010
I still have four more boxes.

4294
02:58:33,290 --> 02:58:35,590
How much did I buy?

4295
02:58:39,910 --> 02:58:41,130
Oh my God.

4296
02:58:43,070 --> 02:58:44,090
Three hours is a lot.

4297
02:58:44,090 --> 02:58:44,650
It's like a week.

4298
02:58:44,790 --> 02:58:46,070
It's still a week.

4299
02:58:46,610 --> 02:58:50,050
Three hours is like a week worth of time, guys.

4300
02:58:50,830 --> 02:58:52,190
That's like a week's worth.

4301
02:58:55,530 --> 02:58:56,510
This is it.

4302
02:58:57,050 --> 02:58:58,930
I bet you it's going to be the last box.

4303
02:58:59,070 --> 02:59:00,690
It's going to be the last box.

4304
02:59:00,910 --> 02:59:01,750
It has to be.

4305
02:59:02,270 --> 02:59:05,170
I should have bought four boxes.

4306
02:59:05,430 --> 02:59:07,470
No, because I don't need to because I know.

4307
02:59:07,510 --> 02:59:08,790
I know the winning pack.

4308
02:59:08,970 --> 02:59:11,290
The winning card is all is in there.

4309
02:59:11,730 --> 02:59:12,530
It's in there.

4310
02:59:14,490 --> 02:59:15,610
You get the one...

4311
02:59:15,610 --> 02:59:17,650
You can't get the 1K card in this box.

4312
02:59:18,110 --> 02:59:19,950
Wait, does the 1K card exist?

4313
02:59:19,950 --> 02:59:23,530
Does it exist in the rare packs?

4314
02:59:24,050 --> 02:59:25,650
Does it exist in the rare packs?

4315
02:59:26,550 --> 02:59:27,790
Or is it just like...

4316
02:59:27,790 --> 02:59:30,050
Is it like a really low chance to appear?

4317
02:59:35,460 --> 02:59:36,300
I need to know.

4318
02:59:36,500 --> 02:59:37,420
It only...

4319
02:59:37,420 --> 02:59:38,360
It should...

4320
02:59:38,360 --> 02:59:39,880
It exists in the rare packs?

4321
02:59:40,180 --> 02:59:41,120
It exists in this pack?

4322
02:59:43,520 --> 02:59:44,920
It's in the purple, no?

4323
02:59:46,040 --> 02:59:46,520
Wait.

4324
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:48,820
It does...

4325
02:59:48,820 --> 02:59:49,260
Oh, it does?

4326
02:59:49,520 --> 02:59:50,780
Okay, we just keep going.

4327
02:59:50,900 --> 02:59:51,540
I knew it.

4328
02:59:51,540 --> 02:59:52,920
We don't stop.

4329
02:59:52,980 --> 02:59:53,740
We just keep going.

4330
02:59:54,160 --> 02:59:55,640
We just have to keep going.

4331
02:59:55,980 --> 02:59:56,700
We just...

4332
02:59:56,700 --> 02:59:58,160
I knew it.

4333
02:59:58,240 --> 02:59:59,400
I fucking knew it.

4334
03:00:00,680 --> 03:00:01,920
We can just keep going.

4335
03:00:02,120 --> 03:00:03,260
I always believe.

4336
03:00:04,900 --> 03:00:06,200
As long as you don't stop.

4337
03:00:06,880 --> 03:00:07,840
As long as...

4338
03:00:08,740 --> 03:00:10,440
As long as we don't stop, guys.

4339
03:00:11,300 --> 03:00:13,040
Never let the doubters get you.

4340
03:00:16,740 --> 03:00:18,760
Never let the doubters win.

4341
03:00:19,480 --> 03:00:20,760
It has to be in here.

4342
03:00:21,520 --> 03:00:22,620
It has to be.

4343
03:00:23,020 --> 03:00:24,780
There's so many cards.

4344
03:00:24,900 --> 03:00:26,480
It has to be in one of them.

4345
03:00:26,760 --> 03:00:27,840
Never quit.

4346
03:00:27,940 --> 03:00:29,520
Never surrender, chat.

4347
03:00:30,900 --> 03:00:32,380
She's behind us.

4348
03:00:36,540 --> 03:00:39,620
If you don't stop, it will happen.

4349
03:00:40,440 --> 03:00:41,760
You never quit.

4350
03:00:41,880 --> 03:00:43,700
The probability rises higher.

4351
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:45,140
The more you...

4352
03:00:45,140 --> 03:00:49,780
The more you unpack the cards, the higher the probability rate.

4353
03:00:49,780 --> 03:00:49,860
Wait.

4354
03:00:49,860 --> 03:00:50,960
Think about that, chat.

4355
03:00:51,200 --> 03:00:52,880
Have you ever thought about that?

4356
03:00:58,620 --> 03:00:59,660
Come on.

4357
03:01:01,980 --> 03:01:04,120
The probability goes higher.

4358
03:01:04,220 --> 03:01:06,860
The more packs you buy, your luck raises higher.

4359
03:01:07,240 --> 03:01:09,020
Because eventually you hit it big.

4360
03:01:10,300 --> 03:01:11,820
That's why you don't quit.

4361
03:01:12,260 --> 03:01:13,060
That's why.

4362
03:01:13,220 --> 03:01:14,900
That's not how statistics work.

4363
03:01:15,060 --> 03:01:15,400
Oh, yeah.

4364
03:01:15,440 --> 03:01:16,500
Where's your math degree?

4365
03:01:16,500 --> 03:01:17,260
Wait.

4366
03:01:19,040 --> 03:01:20,160
I only...

4367
03:01:20,160 --> 03:01:24,640
I only listen to somebody who has a master's degree in statistics.

4368
03:01:27,520 --> 03:01:28,260
It's fine.

4369
03:01:28,320 --> 03:01:29,220
We still have another box.

4370
03:01:31,540 --> 03:01:33,040
We still have another one.

4371
03:01:33,300 --> 03:01:35,840
Don't go into the Capricorn.

4372
03:01:37,780 --> 03:01:38,640
Where's yours?

4373
03:01:38,820 --> 03:01:39,380
Exactly.

4374
03:01:39,640 --> 03:01:40,460
None of us.

4375
03:01:40,660 --> 03:01:41,500
Yeah, exactly.

4376
03:01:41,680 --> 03:01:45,640
So what you say doesn't matter because you don't have the math degree.

4377
03:01:45,640 --> 03:01:48,560
What I say matters because this is my stream.

4378
03:01:53,200 --> 03:01:55,360
Why would I lie to my chat?

4379
03:01:55,700 --> 03:01:58,920
I have a reputation... reputation to uphold.

4380
03:02:03,510 --> 03:02:04,030
Exactly.

4381
03:02:04,230 --> 03:02:07,210
The 0.0001% ain't gonna hit itself.

4382
03:02:08,770 --> 03:02:10,530
Guys, it'll be so worth it.

4383
03:02:10,630 --> 03:02:11,590
It's gonna be...

4384
03:02:11,590 --> 03:02:14,370
It's gonna be so worth it when we hit the jackpot.

4385
03:02:14,650 --> 03:02:16,630
It's gonna be so worth it, guys.

4386
03:02:16,630 --> 03:02:18,430
This is a box of nothing.

4387
03:02:19,290 --> 03:02:21,450
Why is there a box of nothing?

4388
03:02:22,290 --> 03:02:22,990
Oh my god.

4389
03:02:23,010 --> 03:02:24,130
We have two boxes left.

4390
03:02:24,570 --> 03:02:25,910
We have two boxes left.

4391
03:02:25,970 --> 03:02:26,530
This is it.

4392
03:02:26,910 --> 03:02:27,670
This is it.

4393
03:02:27,730 --> 03:02:28,850
It has to be in this one.

4394
03:02:30,650 --> 03:02:32,330
It has to be in this one.

4395
03:02:33,870 --> 03:02:35,250
The last two boxes.

4396
03:02:35,310 --> 03:02:36,410
It has to be.

4397
03:02:36,530 --> 03:02:37,690
This is the streamer moment.

4398
03:02:38,270 --> 03:02:39,990
This is the streamer moment, chat.

4399
03:02:41,830 --> 03:02:42,550
Right here.

4400
03:02:44,270 --> 03:02:45,850
It's a 0% chance.

4401
03:02:45,850 --> 03:02:46,710
Yes, exactly.

4402
03:02:46,930 --> 03:02:49,330
It's a 0% chance if you don't try.

4403
03:02:49,570 --> 03:02:53,210
And by trying, I already raised it to at least 50%.

4404
03:02:54,870 --> 03:02:55,530
That's idiot.

4405
03:02:57,190 --> 03:02:57,970
Come on.

4406
03:02:58,130 --> 03:02:58,870
Come on.

4407
03:02:58,910 --> 03:03:00,090
Give me that 1K.

4408
03:03:00,290 --> 03:03:01,990
That 1K card.

4409
03:03:03,210 --> 03:03:04,110
Come on.

4410
03:03:04,110 --> 03:03:05,090
I know you're alive.

4411
03:03:05,610 --> 03:03:07,450
This is the last box, guys.

4412
03:03:08,210 --> 03:03:09,070
This is it.

4413
03:03:09,130 --> 03:03:10,730
The last box right here.

4414
03:03:11,590 --> 03:03:13,810
I didn't answer my phone for this.

4415
03:03:17,190 --> 03:03:22,950
I don't know what phone call I just got 30 minutes ago.

4416
03:03:23,230 --> 03:03:26,090
But I need a thousand dollars.

4417
03:03:30,370 --> 03:03:31,350
Alright, this is it.

4418
03:03:31,370 --> 03:03:31,690
Come on.

4419
03:03:33,210 --> 03:03:34,130
Maybe it'll be here.

4420
03:03:34,650 --> 03:03:35,590
Maybe it'll be here.

4421
03:03:35,910 --> 03:03:37,710
I don't know how many packs I have left.

4422
03:03:37,950 --> 03:03:39,190
But maybe it'll be this one.

4423
03:03:40,610 --> 03:03:41,970
Maybe it's the next pack.

4424
03:03:42,070 --> 03:03:43,250
It has to be the next pack.

4425
03:03:46,090 --> 03:03:47,350
Wait, maybe it's in...

4426
03:03:47,350 --> 03:03:48,250
Maybe it's in these.

4427
03:03:48,530 --> 03:03:49,550
Maybe it's in these.

4428
03:03:50,190 --> 03:03:51,510
It has to be in these.

4429
03:03:51,810 --> 03:03:52,210
Right?

4430
03:03:52,710 --> 03:03:53,110
Maybe...

4431
03:03:53,110 --> 03:03:54,610
Maybe it's in this one.

4432
03:03:55,090 --> 03:03:55,750
No, guys.

4433
03:03:55,830 --> 03:03:57,110
It's totally in this.

4434
03:03:57,610 --> 03:03:58,610
It's in these, guys.

4435
03:03:58,690 --> 03:03:59,810
No, this is my own pack.

4436
03:03:59,890 --> 03:04:01,150
I made my own pack, guys.

4437
03:04:01,250 --> 03:04:02,670
I made my own box.

4438
03:04:06,190 --> 03:04:08,030
Guys, I made my own box.

4439
03:04:08,130 --> 03:04:09,950
I made my own box.

4440
03:04:10,070 --> 03:04:11,710
It has to be in one of these.

4441
03:04:11,710 --> 03:04:13,070
It has to be.

4442
03:04:13,270 --> 03:04:14,630
I swear, guys.

4443
03:04:17,570 --> 03:04:18,350
Toki, stop.

4444
03:04:18,870 --> 03:04:19,350
Stop.

4445
03:04:19,430 --> 03:04:22,510
These are the customers' booster packs, Toki.

4446
03:04:23,250 --> 03:04:28,490
Toki, that's the customers' booster packs, Toki.

4447
03:04:28,690 --> 03:04:31,230
What happened to not using them?

4448
03:04:32,270 --> 03:04:33,070
But whatever.

4449
03:04:33,230 --> 03:04:34,790
Guys, I think it's in them booster packs.

4450
03:04:34,950 --> 03:04:36,930
I think it's actually in the booster packs, guys.

4451
03:04:37,030 --> 03:04:37,430
I think...

4452
03:04:37,430 --> 03:04:38,710
Guys, I made my own pack.

4453
03:04:38,770 --> 03:04:39,650
I made my own box.

4454
03:04:39,650 --> 03:04:41,530
Guys, I made my own box, guys.

4455
03:04:41,690 --> 03:04:43,290
I made my own box.

4456
03:04:44,990 --> 03:04:47,930
Guys, I don't think this is about the money anymore.

4457
03:04:48,230 --> 03:04:49,970
Guys, thank you for the super chat.

4458
03:04:50,130 --> 03:04:50,490
Thank you.

4459
03:04:50,510 --> 03:04:50,910
Thank you.

4460
03:04:51,050 --> 03:04:51,630
Don't worry.

4461
03:04:53,130 --> 03:04:53,910
It's in here.

4462
03:04:54,010 --> 03:04:56,610
Never get high on your own supply.

4463
03:05:01,510 --> 03:05:02,610
No, it's here.

4464
03:05:02,750 --> 03:05:03,570
It has to be.

4465
03:05:03,970 --> 03:05:05,610
It has to be here.

4466
03:05:07,670 --> 03:05:08,590
Oh, my God.

4467
03:05:08,590 --> 03:05:10,530
But the customers, I knew it.

4468
03:05:10,610 --> 03:05:11,690
They were trying to get my...

4469
03:05:11,690 --> 03:05:12,810
They were trying to scam me.

4470
03:05:12,890 --> 03:05:14,070
I fucking knew it.

4471
03:05:14,090 --> 03:05:17,230
I knew those customers were trying to scam me.

4472
03:05:17,330 --> 03:05:18,330
I knew it.

4473
03:05:18,470 --> 03:05:20,730
I knew they were all supposed to be in here.

4474
03:05:22,790 --> 03:05:24,130
It has to be here.

4475
03:05:25,730 --> 03:05:26,210
Whoa.

4476
03:05:30,290 --> 03:05:31,170
What is that?

4477
03:06:57,400 --> 03:06:59,280
Guys, it's a divine intervention.

4478
03:06:59,480 --> 03:07:01,400
Alright, guys, I gotta call it down.

4479
03:07:01,400 --> 03:07:04,160
Thank you, everybody, for watching.

4480
03:07:04,520 --> 03:07:05,640
I'll give you a...

4481
03:07:05,640 --> 03:07:06,700
I think it's...

4482
03:07:06,700 --> 03:07:08,560
I think that's what I was getting called.

4483
03:07:08,760 --> 03:07:10,580
I think it's like a false alarm.

4484
03:07:11,040 --> 03:07:13,060
Yeah, it's a fire alarm test.

4485
03:07:17,900 --> 03:07:19,480
I can't believe...

4486
03:07:19,480 --> 03:07:20,380
Okay, but last card.

4487
03:07:20,640 --> 03:07:21,420
Let's back.

4488
03:07:21,580 --> 03:07:23,220
Okay, I'm gonna head off now.

4489
03:07:23,600 --> 03:07:26,040
As always, everybody stay hydrated.

4490
03:07:26,360 --> 03:07:27,240
Pause your check.

4491
03:07:27,380 --> 03:07:28,480
Get up and move around.

4492
03:07:28,480 --> 03:07:28,980
Get down.

4493
03:07:29,400 --> 03:07:30,780
Hear that blood flowing?

4494
03:07:30,780 --> 03:07:33,080
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

4495
03:07:33,540 --> 03:07:34,720
Bye, guys.

4496
03:07:35,020 --> 03:07:35,400
Bye.
