00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,130
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,890
I am, I am a mess right now.

3
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,370
But when am I not a mess?

4
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,650
That's a good question.

5
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:08,390
I literally, I literally just installed Fortnite, like, my installation of Fortnite just stopped, like, finished like 10 minutes ago.

6
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:13,590
Because I forgot I didn't, I didn't install Fortnite on this PC yet.

7
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:20,050
Anyway, um, we have our Fortnite bodyguard, Doryu.

8
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,430
Um, he plays Fortnite a lot.

9
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:33,870
By the way, I need you guys to know, um, I had, I had, like, three other Fortnite pros that were supposed to play with me.

10
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:39,810
But then they, like, I don't know, I think they found out I wasn't a Fortnite player and they tried to...

11
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,610
So I'm glad Doryu didn't drop out.

12
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,380
I didn't, I didn't drop out.

13
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,620
Let me tell you a story.

14
00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:02,880
So they asked me, the staff, Twitch staff asked me, um, asked me if, like, if I was willing to join the Fortnite Twitch Rivals.

15
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,920
And I was like, how sweaty is it?

16
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,600
And then they were like, oh, it's pretty sweaty.

17
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,680
And I was like, um...

18
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:20,140
And I was like, uh, um, can you give me a Fortnite pro?

19
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,120
I can, I can do it, but, like, I think I need a Fortnite pro.

20
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,060
And they're like, don't worry, we got you.

21
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,360
Um, so then, so then three, I, we had three different people that we asked.

22
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,920
And, like, yeah.

23
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:44,100
Because I was like, hey, um, I don't know about this.

24
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,020
Seems like this, I thought, you know, there'd be, like, people like me, you know?

25
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,560
I thought there'd be, like, people like me.

26
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,680
And then I looked at the roster.

27
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,200
And then, because, like, some, one of them suggested, the staff suggested me to recruit this player.

28
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,180
And I looked up this person's Twitter.

29
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,080
And they were, like, a, a fucking Fortnite professional.

30
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,000
And then they're, and they're recruiting for their Fortnite Twitch Rivals.

31
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,580
They were, like, looking for a pro Fortnite pro player.

32
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,240
For a Twitch Rivals.

33
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,480
And I'm like, but he's already pro.

34
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,840
What, what do you mean?

35
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,920
Why, why is he looking for a Fortnite pro if he's already pro?

36
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,660
What, what do you mean?

37
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,360
I thought it'd be, like, you know, non-pro with pro.

38
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:33,660
And then I was like, hey, are there any other teams, like, like me?

39
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,140
And they're like, no, don't worry.

40
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,560
There's an Overwatch team as well.

41
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,480
There's, like, two Overwatch players together.

42
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,220
Um, and a team together.

43
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,180
Um, so they're just like you.

44
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,000
And I'm like, okay.

45
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,340
But I looked at it and it's J3 and Apply.

46
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,160
Apply is an, you know, has been an Overwatch cup.

47
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,780
J3 has been top 500 for, like, since Overwatch began.

48
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,100
So I was just like, oh.

49
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,060
I was just like, oh.

50
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,800
And then we, and then finally we got it.

51
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,340
And we got an Overwatch pro.

52
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,380
Uh, not Overwatch pro.

53
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:11,980
We got Fortnite.

54
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,060
We got, we got a Fortnite pro.

55
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,840
Um, we got a Fortnite pro.

56
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,900
And literally, we met up.

57
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,140
We were like, hey, I'm not a, I'm a, I'm not a Fortnite player.

58
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:24,760
Is that okay?

59
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,700
And then the guy was like, oh, don't worry.

60
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,140
It's okay.

61
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,120
Uh, don't worry.

62
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:28,720
We got this.

63
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,740
I was like, oh, thank God.

64
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,100
Okay.

65
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:37,180
Um, and then, like, literally, like, 15 minutes later, I got a message from the staff.

66
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,780
It was like, we need to find a new player.

67
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,920
And I was like, what happened?

68
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:49,060
And then, and then the, and then the, the guy that was supposed to be my duo messaged me and was like, I'm sorry.

69
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,040
We had, I had a family emergency.

70
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,460
I have to drop out.

71
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,420
I was like, we met for 15 minutes.

72
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,420
I was like, what?

73
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,760
Finally, we met for 15 minutes and then you got a family emergency?

74
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,320
I just, what is my luck?

75
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,520
What is my luck?

76
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:22,580
Um, and that was like an hour before, an hour before Twitch Rivals, um, an hour before Twitch Rivals start.

77
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:28,800
So luckily we managed to get, we managed to get Doryu, who plays a lot of Fortnite.

78
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,520
Um, and I was like, that's my new bodyguard.

79
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,640
I have a new bodyguard.

80
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,840
I finally have.

81
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,060
I have another.

82
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,740
I have a new bodyguard.

83
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,540
It took us a while, but we got another Fortnite bodyguard.

84
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,460
Um, so I hope I'll live long enough in this tournament.

85
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:56,380
I, I can't believe I, I, the, the 15 minute part was the most absurd.

86
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,100
Literally, we were in a group chat with me and the Twitch staff and the other pro.

87
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,840
I was like, hey, I don't play Fortnite.

88
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,920
And then we were discussing drops too.

89
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,900
They're like, oh yeah.

90
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,480
What, what place do you want to land?

91
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,780
And I was like, oh, I don't know.

92
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,000
You can pick it.

93
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,420
Pretend.

94
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:15,920
I know like I'm captain by name, but like you can, you can decide everything.

95
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,620
And then 15 minutes later, family emergency.

96
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:33,610
Um, so my, my Fortnite bodyguard is an actual wolf.

97
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,010
Um, we can't lose this.

98
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,450
We literally have an actual werewolf.

99
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,530
So like, we can't lose this.

100
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,610
It's like that ZZZ game, right?

101
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,210
Where people were thirsting over that wolf boy.

102
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,950
Like, like I have a wolf boy too.

103
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,530
So like, we'll be fine.

104
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,750
It's just like that wolf boy.

105
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,830
I have zero context of like what, what that guy is.

106
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:55,930
But like...

107
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:06,150
But like, if that, if ZZZ can survive with a wolf boy.

108
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,430
Maybe I can survive with all of them.

109
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,490
I'm also a wolf boy.

110
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:15,870
All right.

111
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,210
Okay.

112
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,730
I'm going to, I don't know where we're starting.

113
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,550
I'm going to unmute.

114
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,750
Hey.

115
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,210
Who are you?

116
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,890
Are we supposed to?

117
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,150
Do we have the code for the game yet?

118
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,030
Or like...

119
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,090
No, not yet.

120
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,270
I'm like watching it right now.

121
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,910
Everyone is...

122
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,670
I think still like getting situated.

123
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,870
Oh, that's great.

124
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,290
Okay.

125
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,070
Yeah.

126
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,690
That's good.

127
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,430
I'm watching the general chat right now.

128
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,130
Okay.

129
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:40,530
That's good.

130
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,090
Anyway.

131
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,210
Did you read the rules?

132
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,250
Because there's a lot of rules.

133
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:48,370
And I read one paragraph and I was like, I already tuned it out.

134
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,130
So I assume...

135
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:49,710
Yeah, your brain was just like...

136
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,810
I already tuned...

137
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,150
No, it's so long.

138
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,770
Like, why is the rule so long?

139
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:57,650
I don't...

140
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,050
Let me be your guide wolf.

141
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:03,170
I will be the slightly lesser smooth brain.

142
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:03,570
All right.

143
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:03,970
Yeah.

144
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,230
Yeah.

145
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,370
Like, it's so long.

146
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:06,650
Okay.

147
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:07,810
That's for day two.

148
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:08,410
Okay.

149
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,090
Oh, nevermind.

150
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,130
Yeah.

151
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,230
No, day two is crazy.

152
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:10,970
But day one is not too bad.

153
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:11,630
We're not going to make it.

154
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,230
So that's fine.

155
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,130
I was literally telling Cha.

156
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,170
I'm like, I'm in it for the vibes.

157
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,090
I am probably going to die so fucking fast.

158
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,290
It is going to be tragic.

159
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,890
My Cha was like, you have great confidence.

160
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,070
I'm like, no.

161
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:31,410
Okay.

162
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,370
Doryo, you don't understand.

163
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:32,930
Like, I told them the story of like how we ended up getting you.

164
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:33,190
Like, I didn't...

165
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:36,230
I told them the story of like how we ended up getting you.

166
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,390
But basically, I had...

167
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,890
I had three different Fortnite pros that dropped out.

168
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,230
Are you serious?

169
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,250
No fucking way.

170
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,210
And then the last Fortnite pro...

171
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,130
The last...

172
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,990
Like, they were all Twitch assigned too.

173
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,350
They were trying to like assign me a pro player.

174
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,770
Because I was like, please, I need a Fortnite pro.

175
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:59,470
Like, if you want me at this tournament, I'm not going to survive.

176
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:00,970
Like...

177
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,230
No, okay.

178
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,530
I feel your pain.

179
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,430
I'm not going to survive.

180
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,230
Oh my god.

181
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,370
I'm like, I'm not going to survive.

182
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,210
And then...

183
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,090
And then like...

184
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:12,870
And then so like...

185
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,050
I told them like the last Fortnite pro.

186
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,450
Like, I literally...

187
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,470
We got in a group chat.

188
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,150
It was like an hour before the tournament.

189
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:20,790
Before Twitch Rivals.

190
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,470
And we were like in a group chat.

191
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,110
Like, we got them at like 12 or something.

192
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,010
12 p.m.

193
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:26,850
And then...

194
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:27,090
Yeah, yeah.

195
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:27,830
And then like...

196
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,670
And then we were like talking.

197
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,890
I was like, hey, I don't play Fortnite.

198
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,430
Is that okay?

199
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,830
And then he was like, yeah, that's fine.

200
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,310
It's cool.

201
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,370
And then...

202
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,110
And then we were like, yeah, where do you want to drop?

203
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:36,850
It's like, I don't care.

204
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,330
I don't...

205
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,290
I don't know what I'm doing.

206
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:38,370
I don't know what I'm doing.

207
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,730
Like, this is all on you, man.

208
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:44,370
And then 15 minutes later, he messaged me.

209
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,830
I was like, sorry, family emergency.

210
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:46,710
I can't do it.

211
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:47,770
What?

212
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,100
Wait.

213
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:52,900
No.

214
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:54,920
What?

215
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,260
I was like, what?

216
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,700
Did their family emergency not be a family emergency?

217
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,240
Like, literally right before the not family emergency event?

218
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,180
I was like, am I?

219
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,460
Did they just found out?

220
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,120
Like, wait.

221
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,620
No.

222
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,400
She's bad.

223
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:07,880
Bad.

224
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,960
All right, guys.

225
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,060
We are back.

226
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,440
Oh my god.

227
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,760
It was like a phone in a family emergency.

228
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:14,540
No.

229
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:16,540
Okay.

230
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,940
Did they even know that you used to play Apex?

231
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,420
Like, I said, I was like, oh, I'm gonna Apex Overwatch player.

232
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,060
And then...

233
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:29,800
But I honestly think it was it could be what could be a family emergency, but like the timing that was fucking crazy.

234
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,260
Yeah.

235
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:37,400
50 minutes after it, like I don't know, like realization struck for him and he's like, wait a minute.

236
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,380
Dead.

237
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,460
I was fucking dead ass.

238
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,460
I was fucking brushing my teeth.

239
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,580
Checking my phone.

240
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,320
And you messaged me.

241
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,580
And I had fucking bed head and everything.

242
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:48,500
Oh my god.

243
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,460
I was like, please.

244
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,520
I need somebody that knows how to play Fortnite.

245
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,680
You give me too much credit.

246
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,760
I know how to die very fast in this game.

247
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,000
What do you mean?

248
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,500
There's clips of you.

249
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,880
No, are you done?

250
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,920
You're supposed to be my bodyguard.

251
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,940
You were like the last hope.

252
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:12,310
I went through all of them.

253
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,750
I don't remember this episode of Fortnite.

254
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,750
What is it called?

255
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:20,410
Is it literally like Dory, the last protector?

256
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,390
In reality, he's actually a big inting... You're supposed to be my bodyguard.

257
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,510
You're literally a weapon.

258
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,540
I'll eat the bullets.

259
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,600
No, you're not supposed to eat the bullets.

260
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,940
You're supposed to kill them.

261
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,980
We're doomed.

262
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:40,860
We're doomed.

263
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,760
Oh no, it's okay.

264
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,280
We're not going to make it to day two.

265
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,800
It's okay.

266
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,360
What if we make it to day two?

267
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,140
What if we're lured off the board?

268
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,260
Then God actually hates us.

269
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:57,280
And God said, let there be VTubers and furry VTubers.

270
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,160
Oh my god.

271
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,940
You have sinned.

272
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,060
Oh my god.

273
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,420
I fucking... we're fucked.

274
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:02,800
Okay.

275
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,880
Jokey, we ready.

276
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,080
We fucking ready.

277
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,320
Oh my god.

278
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,420
All right.

279
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,740
Okay, they have the code.

280
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,560
We're supposed to...

281
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:10,720
Oh yeah.

282
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,740
We're supposed to be in a party together.

283
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:12,960
Yeah, here.

284
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,760
Let me invite you.

285
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,220
Let me invite you.

286
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:14,840
All right.

287
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,380
Okay.

288
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,540
Also, are you Peter Griffin?

289
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,220
No, I'm John Cena now, so they can't see me.

290
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,660
I do have Peter Griffin, though.

291
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,100
Should I be Peter?

292
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,020
Wait, I could be Peter.

293
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,100
I could be whatever Chat wants me to be.

294
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:32,820
Wait, wait, wait.

295
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,900
What is Chat going to make you?

296
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,820
Because then I can be something to match you.

297
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,200
Well, I have Meeseeks, too.

298
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,720
No, you have Meeseeks.

299
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,580
Yeah, I have Meeseeks.

300
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,540
We could be Rick and Meeseeks.

301
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,080
Do you have Rick?

302
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,760
I don't have...

303
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,280
Yeah, I have Rick.

304
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:43,860
Wait, you have Rick?

305
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,720
Oh my god.

306
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,280
Yeah, I'm being Rick.

307
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,240
Wait, wait, wait.

308
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:47,840
That's great.

309
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,620
Okay, wait.

310
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,200
How do I...

311
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,220
Wait, wait.

312
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,280
How do I go back to...

313
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,440
Wait, am I not?

314
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:52,820
Oh, wait.

315
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,340
Am I not?

316
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:53,880
Join party.

317
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,300
Okay.

318
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,480
Oh my god.

319
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,260
You have Morty.

320
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,060
I have Morty.

321
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,440
Oh my god.

322
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,160
Same character.

323
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:02,940
Same character.

324
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,580
Okay, okay.

325
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,740
Morty and Meeseeks.

326
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,080
Okay, they'll know who to kill first.

327
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:06,920
That's great.

328
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:07,520
They'll know...

329
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,420
They'll know who to get for easy points.

330
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,340
That's how we're gonna send the message.

331
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,120
I think I need to...

332
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,620
Okay, let me enter the code real quick.

333
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,200
Yeah, yeah.

334
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,240
You do the code entering.

335
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,240
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

336
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,740
Okay, I got you.

337
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,200
I got you.

338
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,760
So guys, how's Doryu?

339
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,040
Is Doryu's volume okay?

340
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,500
Yeah, same for you guys, chat.

341
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,440
Can you guys hear Doki fine?

342
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,240
Yeah, yeah.

343
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,660
Can you hear Doryu okay?

344
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,680
And can you hear me okay?

345
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,940
As long as I'm loud in Doryu, that's all that matters.

346
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,280
But also, you can't be like...

347
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,460
You can't...

348
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:38,960
You can't...

349
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,760
Can't hear him.

350
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,400
Yeah, yeah.

351
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,880
My brain is still booting up.

352
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:41,980
My brain is still booting up.

353
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:46,980
I literally got home like 30 minutes ago to install Fortnite.

354
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:48,420
Deadass.

355
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,480
Oh my god.

356
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,860
Doryu, we're so ready.

357
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,500
We are so fucking ready.

358
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,180
We're so ready.

359
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,220
We're so ready.

360
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,760
Okay, hit ready.

361
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,280
A tad though.

362
00:14:59,300 --> 00:14:59,780
I think I got it good.

363
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,260
Okay, let me...

364
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:00,400
We're good.

365
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,160
I'm gonna boost you up a little bit.

366
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,640
And then...

367
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,340
All right.

368
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,320
Okay, I boosted you up.

369
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,080
All right.

370
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,400
Chat, I got Morty on his back.

371
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,840
Or I got Rick on his back, okay?

372
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,200
We got Pickle.

373
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,380
Pickle.

374
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:10,680
Pickle Rick.

375
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,520
Oh, you got Pickle Rick?

376
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,000
Yeah, I got Pickle Rick on his back.

377
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,440
Wait, I think I have Pickle Rick too.

378
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,400
Wait, do you really?

379
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:14,520
Yo, let's go.

380
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,220
Wait, actually, I don't know.

381
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,560
I buy a lot of stuff.

382
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,500
I have the snake...

383
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,420
The pickaxe for the snake.

384
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,540
Oh, you got the snake pickaxe too?

385
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,600
Yo, I'm gonna put that.

386
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:22,740
I got Pickle Rick.

387
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:22,800
Let's go.

388
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,020
Yo.

389
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:24,800
Let's go.

390
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,660
I'm fucking doing it.

391
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,360
I'm doing it.

392
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,400
Guys, you have to be like at a certain IQ to understand this.

393
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:32,860
Let's see.

394
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,280
Wait, wait, wait.

395
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,220
What's it called?

396
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:34,880
It's called the snake?

397
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:35,560
Yeah.

398
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,480
Okay, there it is.

399
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:36,920
There it is.

400
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,440
I got it.

401
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,020
I got it.

402
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,420
All right.

403
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,620
We're still fucking back.

404
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,900
Funniest shit ever, guys.

405
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,740
Oh, we are fucking in this.

406
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,780
They ain't even ready.

407
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:46,780
Yeah, yeah.

408
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,320
They know we're a great team and we're, like, matching.

409
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,520
We got the drip.

410
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,200
Exactly.

411
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,220
We got the drip.

412
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,340
Am I supposed to ready up?

413
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:55,660
Oops.

414
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,380
Yeah, yeah.

415
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:56,940
Go ahead and ready up.

416
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,080
Yeah.

417
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:57,420
All right.

418
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,060
We're fine.

419
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,680
By the way, I was watching.

420
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:05,280
I was checking your stream out because we went live earlier and you were doing game training.

421
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:05,600
Yeah, yeah.

422
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,240
I just want you to know.

423
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:06,900
I was doing the stream.

424
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,360
I was definitely not doing any of that.

425
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,520
Yo, but were you doing food training?

426
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,060
Because I'm about to get hungry.

427
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,300
I was definitely not warming up.

428
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:24,560
The last time I shot the pew-pew was at four in the morning two days ago.

429
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:29,480
Because I was ringing for an apex scrim.

430
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:30,840
Yo.

431
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,340
Wait, you were doing apex scrims?

432
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:33,760
No, no.

433
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,460
It was for, like, somebody's, like...

434
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,760
It was for a Japanese tournament.

435
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,680
So, like, I was ringing for somebody.

436
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,340
Oh, my gosh.

437
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,800
Wait, who are you going to be playing?

438
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,260
Man, can you believe we haven't played apex since, like, three years ago?

439
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,620
I think that's, like, three or four years ago.

440
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,540
Three or four years ago?

441
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,200
When we did that apex rank grind.

442
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,520
Yeah, we ancient.

443
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,280
We ancient.

444
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,420
Yeah, we're fucking old.

445
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,700
Yeah, you used to still be...

446
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,120
You weren't a werewolf yet.

447
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,140
You used to be full fleshy.

448
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,960
I used to be a gross human flesh tuber.

449
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,280
Yeah, and then you got bit by a wolf.

450
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,760
Yeah, you guys won't get bit by a wolf.

451
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,680
And now you got that dog in you.

452
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,320
I mean, you didn't get bit by a wolf.

453
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,300
You was that 0-0...

454
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,680
You were that ZZZ wolf before ZZZ came out.

455
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,300
Oh, husbando.

456
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:12,900
Oh, man.

457
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,140
Wait, you're, like, 30-something, right?

458
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,500
Yeah, I'm, like...

459
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,300
I'm ancient AFM.

460
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:18,660
Oh, my God.

461
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,480
You're old, old.

462
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,240
Yeah, I'm, like, literally old, old.

463
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:21,940
Oh, my God.

464
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,780
I'm, like, crusty, crusty.

465
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,020
I invented the crusty crab.

466
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:26,600
That's all I'm saying.

467
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,400
Holy shit.

468
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,220
Oh, my God.

469
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,780
Yo, how did you ever...

470
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,900
How did you befriend a crusty-ass, crusty crab like me?

471
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,280
April.

472
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:36,640
I was, like, in Apex.

473
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,340
I don't remember.

474
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,000
We, like...

475
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,560
I think, like, it was, like, a friend of a friend in Apex.

476
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,400
I think it was Apex.

477
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,200
And then we just, like, played in ranked.

478
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:43,780
Because we need...

479
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,960
Oh, I think it was, like, a rank.

480
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,200
Because, like, we needed a plus one or something.

481
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:47,380
Yeah, it was ranked.

482
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,280
Yeah, we needed a plus one.

483
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:54,260
I don't know if it was you who needed a plus one or I needed a plus one, but we were granting rank or something for Apex.

484
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,300
Wait, was that, like, LFG back then?

485
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,000
Was it LFG?

486
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,760
Like, in Apex Discord?

487
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,720
I don't remember.

488
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,780
I actually don't.

489
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,560
I feel like it might have been.

490
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,540
I feel like it might...

491
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:06,900
It could have been.

492
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,940
I think it was through a friend.

493
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,500
Because, like, I remember one of us needed, like, a plus one for ranked.

494
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:11,780
Yeah.

495
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,800
And then, like, we needed...

496
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,200
We were trying to get Pred or something.

497
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,140
And, like, we were just LFG-ed or...

498
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,960
Like, we just, like...

499
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,320
Like, we, like...

500
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:20,960
Oh, I know some...

501
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,860
Like, a mutual friend was, like, we know somebody.

502
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,740
And it was, like...

503
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:23,920
Yeah.

504
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:24,640
You or me.

505
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:26,980
God, like...

506
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,380
Wait, was it you that tweeted that clip from Apex days?

507
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,040
Yeah, yeah.

508
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,240
When we were, like, fucking WK?

509
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,720
When we were, like, meeting you and saying...

510
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,120
And we, like, fucking killed, like, some fucking pro-Pred team.

511
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:36,280
Yeah.

512
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,660
And they were, like, what...

513
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,460
Because I didn't...

514
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,040
I stopped grinding rank at that time.

515
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:40,520
So, I was plat.

516
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,380
Yeah, yeah.

517
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,660
And then he was, like, who the fuck is this plat player?

518
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:44,860
Doki Bird.

519
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,780
Who the fuck is she?

520
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,260
Or they don't even say, is he?

521
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,720
Who the fuck is he?

522
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,180
We were being so gremlin.

523
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,000
We were so gremlin to that.

524
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,240
Yeah, because they were, like, he's plat.

525
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,380
What the fuck?

526
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,600
Yeah, look at...

527
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,400
Look at this plat Doki.

528
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,780
Doki Bird looking ass.

529
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:58,800
Yeah, yeah.

530
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,760
Because we shit on them.

531
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,880
They were literally, like, top 10 Pred or whatever.

532
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,240
Damn.

533
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,140
Oh, my God.

534
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,560
I've not been playing Apex at all.

535
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,280
I'm still watching Apex.

536
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:06,680
I'm still watching that game now.

537
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:06,880
Oh, sorry.

538
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,660
Same here.

539
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,380
Doki, we in this.

540
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,280
We in this.

541
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,440
Wait.

542
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:12,980
Where are you?

543
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:13,980
I don't know.

544
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:14,740
I'm still connecting.

545
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,440
I'm still connecting.

546
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,380
Oh, my God.

547
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:16,760
It's us.

548
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,060
Look.

549
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,580
It's us.

550
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,800
We are in Pickle Rick.

551
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,100
Pickle Rick.

552
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,240
Wait.

553
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,200
What emotes you got?

554
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:21,860
What emotes you got?

555
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,060
Wait.

556
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:22,340
I don't remember.

557
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,040
What button is it?

558
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,820
What button is it?

559
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,140
I think I'd be on mine.

560
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:25,660
Oh, shit.

561
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,240
We're, like, going.

562
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,620
Where's your drop spot?

563
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,000
We're going here.

564
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,120
We're going here.

565
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,340
So, land on the blue mark.

566
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:36,400
No.

567
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:36,560
Okay.

568
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,920
I'm going to go here.

569
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,780
And I'm going to get all the loot from that.

570
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,520
And I'll run over to you.

571
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,400
Oh, so I land on the red, right?

572
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,160
Yeah.

573
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:42,700
You land on the red.

574
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:42,840
Yeah.

575
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:42,920
Yeah.

576
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,100
Okay.

577
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,280
Okay.

578
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:43,500
Okay.

579
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,200
Guys, is Dory's volume better now?

580
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,160
Or does he need to be lifted up more?

581
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,380
Yay.

582
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,200
Let's go.

583
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:53,600
Let's go.

584
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,500
All right.

585
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,060
I have no idea what the equipments are.

586
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:58,540
So...

587
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,720
Oh, there's the plunger gun.

588
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,400
Literally run everything and anything you want to run.

589
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:03,860
Okay.

590
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,200
Cool.

591
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,260
And then you do everything else.

592
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:08,620
Basically.

593
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,280
Basically.

594
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,520
I'll just exist.

595
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,000
Yeah.

596
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:11,220
Yeah.

597
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:11,640
I'll exist.

598
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:12,520
Yeah.

599
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:12,680
Yeah.

600
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,740
As long as I'm alive, then, like, we've already accomplished a lot.

601
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,880
You have...

602
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,080
You know, like, about shields and stuff, though.

603
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:20,220
Yeah?

604
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:20,620
Yeah.

605
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:20,840
Yeah.

606
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,000
Yeah.

607
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,160
Yeah.

608
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,320
Yeah.

609
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:21,560
Okay.

610
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,080
Okay.

611
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:22,320
Cool.

612
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:22,460
Yeah.

613
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:22,740
I know.

614
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,560
I know about shields.

615
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,420
I have cosmetics.

616
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,900
So, at least I know that.

617
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,520
That's awesome.

618
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:26,920
Yay!

619
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:28,760
Wow!

620
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,160
What did I do?

621
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,720
Oh, there's a little trampoline.

622
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:32,960
All right.

623
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,460
I got all my loot over here.

624
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,960
So, I'm gonna, like, run through here.

625
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,100
Wait.

626
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,220
I got a fucking trampoline thing.

627
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,520
Oh, those are really, really good.

628
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,020
I think I've seen where you used it.

629
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,500
The thing...

630
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:42,680
Oh, yeah.

631
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,580
If you double jump, it, like, auto-deploys it, which is really annoying.

632
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,940
Because I was like, what the fuck?

633
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,220
How did that happen?

634
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,400
Wait.

635
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,100
How do I...

636
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,060
I was watching the house.

637
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,040
I'm gonna try to find us, like...

638
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,880
So, you know, in build mode, everyone turns into...

639
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,260
Like, a freaking tower or whatever.

640
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:57,560
Yeah.

641
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:57,820
Yeah.

642
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:57,920
Yeah.

643
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,720
By the way, I have...

644
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,260
I dropped a plen...

645
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:01,840
A grappler.

646
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,440
We want it.

647
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,440
Oh, you don't want that?

648
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,740
I don't think I can use it.

649
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:10,340
I don't think it's smart for me to use it.

650
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,740
Do you want to use shockwaves?

651
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,680
Do you know how to use shockwaves?

652
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,540
What's shockwaves?

653
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,080
It's the purple thing that basically, like, launches you into the air.

654
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:19,480
Oh, yeah.

655
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:19,780
No.

656
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,240
It's, like, the pathfinder grapple in this game.

657
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,820
Any movement stuff, do not rely on me for this game.

658
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:25,880
Okay.

659
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,100
I...

660
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,640
Look, my job is to exist.

661
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:28,780
Wait, you want the plunder gun?

662
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,880
Yeah, I'll take the plunder gun.

663
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,700
Oh, my God.

664
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:30,980
Okay.

665
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,120
No.

666
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,360
Take it.

667
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:31,580
Take it.

668
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:31,700
Take it.

669
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:31,860
Take it.

670
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,380
What do I drop?

671
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,260
What do I drop, though?

672
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,080
Oh, wait.

673
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,680
What guns are you using?

674
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,760
I have...

675
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,080
Okay.

676
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,080
Okay.

677
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:38,700
I'll drop...

678
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,380
I have one gun.

679
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,180
Do you want a shotgun?

680
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:43,540
No.

681
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,840
I'll take this gun.

682
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,740
This gun is tracking.

683
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,540
I can track.

684
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,400
Yo.

685
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:47,860
Okay.

686
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,080
Okay.

687
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:48,260
Okay.

688
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,020
I don't know what any of those words are.

689
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,500
The RNG in the bullets is very very bad.

690
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,360
Oh, okay.

691
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:05,900
Okay.

692
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,980
Oh, bloom bloom as in FPS...

693
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:08,900
Okay.

694
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,480
I thought it was, like, a Fortnite word.

695
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,400
I thought you are using a Fortnite word on me.

696
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,040
I...

697
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,640
It must be like, no.

698
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,000
No.

699
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,680
Orlando Bloom is atrocious, because he is going to be in the co lab very soon.

700
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,060
Okay.

701
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:18,960
Okay.

702
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,160
So, Zone is closing.

703
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:21,980
And...

704
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,200
Wait.

705
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:22,580
What the hell.

706
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,760
We're right next to it.

707
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,780
We're next to the zone.

708
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,640
Oh, hey, there it is!

709
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,300
Oh, there's a chest here!

710
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:26,940
Yeah!

711
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,580
Oh, okay, so... do you see these little bunkers right here on the ground?

712
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:31,720
Yeah, yeah.

713
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,980
Oh, I know the port-a-bunkers!

714
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:33,340
Yeah, yeah.

715
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,060
Yeah, yeah.

716
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:34,780
Grab those.

717
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,260
It's okay.

718
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,020
We're right next to the zone.

719
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,780
I'm gonna slash this thing.

720
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,100
Okay.

721
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:40,780
Yeah.

722
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,840
Alright, let's go to the right?

723
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,540
Alright, sure.

724
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,120
Let's go through here.

725
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:48,780
Whee!

726
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,200
Come here, Meeseeks!

727
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,760
Oh my god!

728
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:51,500
Wait!

729
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,560
Somebody's dead!

730
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,180
We're not last!

731
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,660
No, we're not last!

732
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,300
We're vibing!

733
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,680
We're fucking vibing right now.

734
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,400
Oh, we're not last!

735
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:57,860
Thank you!

736
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,780
We're actually vibing.

737
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,940
Let's fucking go!

738
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,760
We're doing so much already!

739
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,580
Yo, all we gotta do is exist, okay?

740
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,580
That's all we have to do.

741
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,040
That's how we already got points for not being last!

742
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:09,820
Let's go!

743
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,900
Yeah, we're fucking chillin' right now.

744
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,240
We were...

745
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,420
We should, like, change our sins every game, just so they don't farm us.

746
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,320
I'm down!

747
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,260
Oh, there's a team here.

748
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:16,800
There's a team here.

749
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,100
There's a team here.

750
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,740
I'm gonna back real quick.

751
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,700
Let's get around.

752
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,180
Let's try to beat them.

753
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:20,620
Let's be evasive.

754
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,260
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

755
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,000
Let's go, like, over here.

756
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

757
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,700
It was a condom skin.

758
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,100
You know the grey superhero ones?

759
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,160
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

760
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,140
Hold on.

761
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,400
They're gonna be to the right.

762
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,760
Oh, yeah, they see us.

763
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,040
They see us.

764
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:31,360
They see us.

765
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,020
Oh, they do.

766
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:32,340
They do.

767
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,180
Oh, they're doing... they're jumping up.

768
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,320
Alright, let's keep... let's go over here.

769
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,460
Yeah, no, I feel like... I feel like they're... they have matching skins, too.

770
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,620
So they could be really, really good matching skins, or really, really bad matching skins like us.

771
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,120
They might be just as scared as us.

772
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:46,860
That's true.

773
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,780
Oh my god, I can...

774
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,860
If we watch it back, they're gonna be probably mirroring us over here.

775
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,980
There's also... oh, there's team over here.

776
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:52,400
Alright.

777
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,400
Let's go under the bridge.

778
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:53,960
Let's go under the bridge.

779
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,240
Okay.

780
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,060
Let's go here.

781
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,880
Alright, I'm heading down with you.

782
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,160
I'm looking for you.

783
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,440
I'm looking for you.

784
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,360
Oh, we're chilling here.

785
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:02,740
We're chilling.

786
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,080
We're chilling.

787
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,920
Alright, nice, nice, nice.

788
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,760
Okay, I'm gonna... just kinda crouch here.

789
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,940
We can just... we can vibe.

790
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,680
We can vibrate here.

791
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,300
Ooh, I hear them shooting.

792
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,720
They're shooting already.

793
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,560
Not last.

794
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,300
Yeah, we're... we're chilling.

795
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,560
Look at me, level one and... level 100 and 46?

796
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,780
You said you didn't play!

797
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,500
I don't play this game.

798
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:19,960
What do you mean?

799
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,520
Level 100 and 46?

800
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,800
I'm really level one!

801
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,020
Yeah, that's scrub levels, right?

802
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:25,740
That's scrub.

803
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,980
What am I?

804
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,360
What am I?

805
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,640
You're Mr. Meeseeks.

806
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,240
You got a little...

807
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,660
I'm level one!

808
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,360
What am I then?

809
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,040
You're... I don't know.

810
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:36,540
You're level...

811
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,320
Okay, can they hear that?

812
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,840
Oh, they definitely can't hear me.

813
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,100
What the fuck?

814
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,460
Now they know we're down here.

815
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,180
No, we're chilling.

816
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,920
I think I'd be, like, super close to it.

817
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,600
So, like, no, that...

818
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,100
We're here.

819
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,760
Oh, they apparently said I don't have the visual feedback.

820
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:51,680
Oh...

821
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,700
Oh, you don't have...

822
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,700
Okay, hold on.

823
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,540
I got an idea.

824
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:54,900
I got an idea.

825
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,640
Hit escape... Oh, no, actually, don't do it.

826
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,080
There's people above us.

827
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I was gonna say.

828
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,280
I didn't... I don't know.

829
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,420
You're gonna be right here?

830
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,120
And then I turn that off.

831
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,560
Okay, I'll watch for us.

832
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,100
I'm watching for us.

833
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:06,920
Okay.

834
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,580
Oh, this thing got cracked above us?

835
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,760
We might be able to get them if they, like...

836
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,220
Drop down?

837
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:14,860
38?

838
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,120
Wait, what?

839
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:16,460
What?

840
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:16,760
What?

841
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,880
They are right above us.

842
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,500
We're gonna put pressure on them if they try to, like...

843
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,140
Don't look down.

844
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:23,820
Don't look down.

845
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,240
Don't look down.

846
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,900
Oh, we're gonna have to move, so... Oh, fuck, I have a crown!

847
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:30,640
I'm so dumb!

848
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,860
Wait, you have a crown?

849
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:32,780
What's that?

850
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,700
Yeah, I do not want this crown.

851
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,620
Oh, that means I won the last game.

852
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,220
Oh, wait, they didn't turn that off!

853
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,080
That's so unfair!

854
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,500
Wait, wait, wait, oh, Doki Doki, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here.

855
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,900
Look at this, look at this, look at this.

856
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:43,120
Yeah.

857
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,160
We can shoot these guys in the back.

858
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,120
3, 2, 1, the one on the left.

859
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:46,740
Yeah.

860
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,680
Oh, no, never mind, okay.

861
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,260
Okay, okay.

862
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,020
Okay, well, we're gonna go to the left then.

863
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:51,500
Goodbye!

864
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:53,720
Goodbye!

865
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,400
Oh, yep, I'm gonna do this.

866
00:25:59,400 --> 00:25:59,600
Oh, okay.

867
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,480
I'm gonna do this again, and I'm gonna splash us.

868
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,360
Nice.

869
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,760
Oh my god, that was quick reaction.

870
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,680
You want my portal bunker?

871
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,800
Uh, carry... you sure you don't want to carry it?

872
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,940
No, I'm pretty sure.

873
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:13,880
Okay.

874
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,760
Okay, so...

875
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,900
Follow me here, follow me, follow me.

876
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,660
We're gonna crouch, we're gonna go to the side.

877
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,380
Am I crouching?

878
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:25,680
No.

879
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,260
Yeah, there you go, there you go.

880
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:35,500
Okay, get ready, and we're gonna run in 3, 2, 1, let's start going.

881
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,180
Okay.

882
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,140
We're gonna see his team in a sec.

883
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:38,960
Oh, they're right in front.

884
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,080
I'm gonna get on here.

885
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,200
We're gonna shoot on the left.

886
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,420
Uh, okay.

887
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,980
Doki, we're gonna have to go over here.

888
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,460
Okay.

889
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,500
So, stand right on me, stand right on me.

890
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:50,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

891
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,080
Oh, we're gonna get shot in the back.

892
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,360
What the fuck are they doing here?

893
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,280
What the fuck are they doing here?

894
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,240
Come on, I got us, I got us, I got us.

895
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:55,560
Okay.

896
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,800
Uh, okay, so...

897
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,220
Yeah?

898
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,060
Do you know how to shockwave yourself?

899
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,260
We'll find out.

900
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,720
Take that thing and use it like a Pathfinder.

901
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,060
Grab it.

902
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:08,440
Okay.

903
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,500
All right, time to fight.

904
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,060
Wait, do it at your feet?

905
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:10,600
Like this?

906
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,660
Oh, shit!

907
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,640
Oh, did I knock you?

908
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:13,620
No!

909
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:14,900
No!

910
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,120
No!

911
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:15,740
No!

912
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,080
No, I'm not done until you knock me.

913
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:16,520
Ohh...

914
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,740
I have 16!

915
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,120
Oh yeah.

916
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,420
I think you shocked me into the other team!

917
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,520
No!

918
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,040
Its nations a condom skin!

919
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,260
Every...

920
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,380
slave!

921
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,320
That was all part of the plan.

922
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,380
It was going to be an evasive shockwave and then we're going to go...

923
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,200
That was part of the plan.

924
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,620
What was the plan?

925
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,460
What was the plan?

926
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,940
Oh, they have the apex thing now.

927
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,200
They have that thing.

928
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,700
Wait, you had the grapple.

929
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,320
Oh, I had the plunger grapple.

930
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,340
I could have used that.

931
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,640
They're using my...

932
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,240
They're using my plunger...

933
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:09,980
Oh, that's where you died.

934
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,400
Yeah, that's where I died at.

935
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:11,640
Yeah, yeah.

936
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,100
See these skins?

937
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,340
These are what we call the condom skins.

938
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,040
Oh, cool.

939
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,600
Wait, so you do play Fortnite.

940
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,680
You know all the lingo.

941
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,940
You know the lingo.

942
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,440
Yeah, Chad, do you guys know about the condom skins?

943
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:27,180
Wait, okay, so how do I turn on the audio feedback?

944
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:31,300
So, under settings, go to...

945
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:32,980
Oh, let's see.

946
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,840
Is it the very last one?

947
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,220
No, no, no.

948
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,260
I think it's under...

949
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,540
Oh, where is it?

950
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,600
I gotta find it again.

951
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,120
Is it visual sound effects?

952
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,860
Yeah, yeah, it's that one.

953
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,420
Just turn that on.

954
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,120
Alright, alright, we're good.

955
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,220
We're good to go.

956
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,140
Guys.

957
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,200
Yo, we weren't dead last.

958
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,600
Yeah, we're not last.

959
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,940
How many teams are in it?

960
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,600
I think it's 40 teams, I think.

961
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,000
Whoa, we did it all the way?

962
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,740
It's 20 teams.

963
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,580
You should have lied and said 40 so I felt happier.

964
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,180
Let me look at the team numbers.

965
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,160
Yeah, out of 20 teams?

966
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,080
We were...

967
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,620
I think...

968
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:16,780
12?

969
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,900
No, we were 16.

970
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:20,880
We played 16.

971
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:21,900
Oh, you're right.

972
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,840
Yeah, we were 16.

973
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,880
I'm like, there's numbers on the top.

974
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,520
There's literally a number right there at the top.

975
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,280
There's literally a number at the top.

976
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,060
I was like, where did you get the 12 from?

977
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:36,200
I'm like over here looking at Discord like, oh, let me put on my nerd glasses real quick.

978
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,100
I got them.

979
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:38,540
Alright.

980
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,660
Let me... okay.

981
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,720
My audio guy said turn you down just a little bit and then boost up the audio.

982
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,640
So give me a sec.

983
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,300
I'm gonna turn you down just a little bit.

984
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,560
And then... alright, guys.

985
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,120
Does the game sound a lot better, chat?

986
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,080
Is it... does the game sound a lot better?

987
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,480
How does Doki sound to you guys too?

988
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,280
Is Doki pretty okay?

989
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,440
Thank you so much, Bob.

990
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,200
Thank you.

991
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,080
Alright.

992
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,420
I just have to make sure.

993
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,120
Alright, guys.

994
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,500
That was our warm up game.

995
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,460
Yeah, that was a warm up.

996
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,160
That was literally the warm up game.

997
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,800
That was a warm up, chat.

998
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,860
I had literally no idea what I'm doing.

999
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,980
I still don't, but like now...

1000
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:19,860
At least...

1001
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,560
At least, like, I know a little bit more.

1002
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,540
That's all that matters.

1003
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,260
What the fuck?

1004
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,340
They said no build.

1005
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,480
Who the fuck put all these portal bunkers?

1006
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,580
Yo, fucking... This is what I tell chat all the time.

1007
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,180
I'm like...

1008
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,820
How is it no build if there's bunkers?

1009
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,260
Thank you.

1010
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,660
That's counterintuitive to no building!

1011
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,340
Because you're still building a bunker!

1012
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,000
I literally complain about this all the time.

1013
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,460
I'm like... I love zero build.

1014
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:48,800
Wait.

1015
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,140
I love...

1016
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:50,660
Oh my god!

1017
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,880
That's how you do... Oh my god!

1018
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,860
That's how you do the jump.

1019
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,820
Oh, it doesn't matter.

1020
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,080
She's still dead.

1021
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:55,460
Yeah, you like...

1022
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:58,060
You throw a... You basically throw... It's like a grenade.

1023
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,820
You like throw it at your feet, and then it'll launch you wherever direction that your character is standing on.

1024
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,260
Oh!

1025
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:03,900
I see.

1026
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,780
But the nice thing about this mode is that...

1027
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,060
It responded... Did you ever play Three Strikes?

1028
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1029
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,500
It's like Three Strikes.

1030
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,120
It's like Three Strikes in Fortnite.

1031
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:14,740
Yeah.

1032
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,800
So, as long as one person's still alive, we're chillin'.

1033
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,180
These guys are such nerds.

1034
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,640
They're doing like same skin.

1035
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:21,820
They're not...

1036
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,380
I know, right?

1037
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,980
You can do like matching themes.

1038
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,400
That's like... You know how like...

1039
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,780
Um... Like...

1040
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,600
Like beta... Betas use same skin.

1041
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,060
Alpha and Sigma males use matching themes.

1042
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:36,460
Yeah, I don't see any like... There's no chat right now.

1043
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,020
Everyone's just a condom.

1044
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,760
Same skin is boring.

1045
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,480
It's all about the theme.

1046
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,660
It's the theming of the skin.

1047
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,240
Wait, do you have Dragon Ball skins?

1048
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1049
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,680
I have... Yo!

1050
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,320
I have all the good ones.

1051
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,660
Which one do you want?

1052
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,120
Do you have all the good... all of them as well?

1053
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,340
I think I do, yeah.

1054
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,900
I'm pretty sure I have all the... Well, all the first wave?

1055
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,500
Because I think they did a second wave of like...

1056
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,260
I have like... I have Frieza and Cell and Vegeta.

1057
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,180
What?

1058
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,220
You have Frieza and Cell?

1059
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:03,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1060
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:03,920
I have Frieza and Cell.

1061
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,820
I have Goku, too, I think.

1062
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,160
Oh, I'm so jelly.

1063
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,380
Okay, I don't have Frieza, but I do have Goku and like Vegeta and stuff.

1064
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:09,840
Oh, okay.

1065
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,060
Wait, we could do Goku and Vegeta.

1066
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,620
I got Team Big Forehead.

1067
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,520
Oh, my God.

1068
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,680
Okay, do we want to do the...

1069
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,760
Or we do villains.

1070
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:20,040
Do we want to do Villain Hero or just the heroes?

1071
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,460
Uh, I'm down.

1072
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,460
I'm down for villains.

1073
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,080
Villain Hero?

1074
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,260
Okay, I can do Frieza and you can be Goku.

1075
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:27,500
Alright.

1076
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,680
The teamwork of the century.

1077
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,340
The collab of the century.

1078
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,600
Frieza and Goku working together in Fortnite to beat the Fortnite players.

1079
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,040
Kakarot, I must beat Fortnite players.

1080
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,980
I can't believe it.

1081
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,140
The team up.

1082
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,940
They teamed up together so they can beat Fortnite.

1083
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,700
I never foresaw this happening.

1084
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,620
If you ever asked me in the past.

1085
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:51,760
I can't believe it.

1086
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,060
The ending we all wanted.

1087
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,260
It's the dream duo.

1088
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,060
The tournament of power loss episode.

1089
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,280
Let's go!

1090
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:04,820
Let's go!

1091
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:13,700
I am so happy that out of all the teams that are playing in this tourney no one is ready for team Kakarot and Vegeta.

1092
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:14,480
Yeah, yeah.

1093
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,040
No, we're Frieza.

1094
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:16,900
Frieza, I mean.

1095
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:17,580
Yeah, Frieza.

1096
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,200
How could you?

1097
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:18,920
Fake fan.

1098
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:19,720
No!

1099
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:20,560
No!

1100
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,820
No, not like this!

1101
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,120
You're a fake fan!

1102
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:27,480
You try to pretend you're a real fan by using Kakarot!

1103
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,900
But you're a fake fan!

1104
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,700
You mistaken Frieza with Vegeta!

1105
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,620
Yeah, I'm more of a Naruto fan.

1106
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,760
I can't believe it!

1107
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,860
I have not watched Dragon Ball since I think uh...

1108
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,320
Z?

1109
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,480
What was after Z?

1110
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,640
They did GT on Cartoon Network.

1111
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,920
GT, which is not Which is not canon.

1112
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,460
Yeah, which is not canon and doesn't exist in Dragon Ball eyes.

1113
00:33:54,760 --> 00:34:00,800
I know one person that has stood by GT being amazing and otherwise everyone has sinned against it.

1114
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,900
Wait, you think GT is amazing?

1115
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,200
Me?

1116
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,800
No, no, I do not think so.

1117
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,260
Oh, okay, okay, I was going to say, then we know you're an actual fake fan.

1118
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,760
I haven't even watched it!

1119
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:22,900
I remember when, when you know, in Dragon Ball, they Dragon Balled and then they like, did the Z thing and then, you know, when Naruto What the fuck is the Z thing?

1120
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:27,160
What is the Z thing in your world?

1121
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:27,700
Like what?

1122
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,000
Holy shit, this guy's a Fortnite player.

1123
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,240
Oh, you want to know what Z means?

1124
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,120
You want to know how I got the fucking Z?

1125
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:34,560
Yeah.

1126
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,720
It's literally because someone took Doryu on Twitch.

1127
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,420
Oh, so then you're like Doryu Z.

1128
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:45,040
Yeah, so like, everyone, everyone who's like, yo, what's the cool lore to your name?

1129
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,040
I'm like, I couldn't take my original name.

1130
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,460
You're just Z.

1131
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,560
That's my lore.

1132
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,960
Big Dragon Ball fan over here.

1133
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,380
I was like, um, his name is Naruto.

1134
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,940
Goku is his dad.

1135
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:20,480
You know when Bulma, like, did the Bulma thing and then... Yeah, you know when Bulma and Sakura, like, worked together to rescue Boruto, and um, and then after that, that like, Bleached Man came over and... Yeah.

1136
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,520
I can't believe, I can't I can't believe... Sasuke Kurosake.

1137
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:33,100
Yeah, yeah, and then like, Sasuke came over with Luffy, the something, uh, to help and find the One Piece.

1138
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,240
That's it, right?

1139
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:41,840
You know, I was hurting my brain by trying to formulate all these thoughts, but like, we're hurting our brain collectively as a team right now.

1140
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,900
Wait, Bleach Man's name isn't Bleach?

1141
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,400
He has an actual name?

1142
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,840
Yeah, you know, his name is Man Bleach, or John Bleach.

1143
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,000
Oh, it's John Bleach Man, right?

1144
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,120
John Bleach Man, yeah.

1145
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,960
Yeah, when he carries that big-ass gun.

1146
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:57,980
You know?

1147
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1148
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,700
And he's out there... from that one Final Fantasy game.

1149
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,520
And he's out there to find the Dragon Balls.

1150
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:08,840
Yeah, and then, uh, he throws the Dragon Balls and then it summons Ifrit, right?

1151
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,240
Yeah, yeah, he summons Vegeta.

1152
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,780
Oh, yeah, I remember that.

1153
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,180
Yeah, yeah.

1154
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,260
Oh, that was such a good episode.

1155
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,080
That's like the big-ass monkey.

1156
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,560
Vegeta, the monkey.

1157
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,420
Oh, you mean...

1158
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:22,540
Tarzan?

1159
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,020
Tarzan?

1160
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,920
Wait, they made Japanese Tarzan?

1161
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,900
You know, they probably did.

1162
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:28,780
They probably did.

1163
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,340
There's just a fanfic of, like, anime Tarzan.

1164
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,100
And then they saved the world!

1165
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,320
I guarantee you someone is searching it right now on, like, DeviantArt.

1166
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,800
If DeviantArt even still is alive.

1167
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,980
This is how I lost all my fans.

1168
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,800
By butchering five different big fandoms in anime.

1169
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:52,240
Five of the biggest anime fandoms ever.

1170
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,880
But we didn't slander Evangelion yet, though.

1171
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,260
Which I actually just watched.

1172
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,600
I literally just watched it for the first time.

1173
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,200
Yeah, we just watched it.

1174
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,020
Did you realize, like, the company went bankrupt recently?

1175
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,140
Wait, what?

1176
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:04,980
No!

1177
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,420
Yeah, for, like, for, like, money laundering or something.

1178
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,960
Oh, wait, are you talking about Studio Trigger or the studio behind it?

1179
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,280
The studio, the original studio behind it.

1180
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,820
They, like, Jesus Christ, what the fuck am I watching?

1181
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,420
Why is there a fucking easter egg head?

1182
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,360
There's an easter egg head.

1183
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1184
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:31,160
He just died years ago, but they officially died recently.

1185
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:36,580
Like, as in, like, I think, like, there was a news article saying they just, like, recently got, like, a sentence or whatever.

1186
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:37,620
What?

1187
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,900
Like, the directors for the behind, the CEO behind.

1188
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,840
Oh my god, the condom men won!

1189
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,580
Yo, what?

1190
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,240
The condom men?

1191
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,940
There's several condom men?

1192
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:46,960
Yo.

1193
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,580
There's several condom men.

1194
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,560
So fucking sweaty.

1195
00:37:53,080 --> 00:38:00,980
I feel like when the condom skins get put on, you know that, like, clown image of the guy in the mirror, like, putting the makeup on?

1196
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,100
It's like the condom skins, like, it's time to go to work.

1197
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:04,300
Why do you think they're so cool?

1198
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:08,980
Other games don't think you're cool with the condom men skin.

1199
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,840
They think you're fucking nerds.

1200
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,460
You're basically the bald wraith of Apex.

1201
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,300
That's not a compliment.

1202
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,620
I have always called him the bald wraith of Apex.

1203
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,080
I fucking love you.

1204
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,520
Yeah, you can be exactly.

1205
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,960
Someone's like, you can literally be Goku.

1206
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,660
Why would you be a condom?

1207
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,440
Exactly!

1208
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,180
That's what I'm saying.

1209
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,860
How do we back out?

1210
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,760
Return to lobby?

1211
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,500
Yeah, I think we back out.

1212
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,220
Yeah, return to lobby.

1213
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,340
Alright, I'm gonna be...

1214
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,620
You can literally be... You can be Eddie!

1215
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,320
You can be the fucking people in Lethal Company!

1216
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,420
They literally added Lethal Company!

1217
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,540
And for that, you decided to be a condom?

1218
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,120
No, I wanna be a condom.

1219
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,700
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1220
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,460
Anyway, I'm gonna be Frieza.

1221
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:58,760
Alright.

1222
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,700
So, and I'm being Vegeta, right?

1223
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,640
Yeah, yeah.

1224
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,140
No, no.

1225
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:02,840
Goku, Goku.

1226
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:03,840
Oh, I'm gonna be Goku.

1227
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:04,120
Okay.

1228
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,260
Alright, let's see what's in the shop.

1229
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,620
What the fuck is this?

1230
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,740
The signature style?

1231
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:09,540
What the...

1232
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,520
Do you see that?

1233
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,060
The mad mochi outfit?

1234
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:18,320
Oh, is it the big, like, the thing that looks like they're from Super Mario?

1235
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,080
What?

1236
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,540
Mad mochi?

1237
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, like the build-up.

1238
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,880
A tall, like, mochi ball man.

1239
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,300
Yeah!

1240
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,760
Like, what the fuck is wrong with you?

1241
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,500
You can literally be a mad mochi person.

1242
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,020
Oh my god, I thought you were Lando Bloom!

1243
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,720
Yeah, Lando Bloom is literally in here!

1244
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:41,880
Guys, by the way, if you wanna support a creator, you can use Doki Bird right here.

Yeah, they have Lady Gaga and they have Ariana Grande.

1253
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,640
Oh my god, I was so behind!

1254
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,640
I was so...

1255
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:08,380
The only thing I remember from it was the Lethal Company men.

1256
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,280
Doki, the night is young.

1257
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,460
We can literally play so many combos.

1258
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,260
Oh my god!

1259
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,380
There's like... Oh, they added more Marvel characters.

1260
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,620
Yeah, we could literally be Thanos and, like, Black Widow.

1261
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,520
Or we could be...

1262
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,180
Oh my god!

1263
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:27,360
Lady Gaga with... I can't believe Pius the Caribbean is in here!

1264
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:28,420
Right?

1265
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,780
What the fuck?

1266
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:35,240
They're doing a big update on Friday, where they're gonna add, uh, a bunch of, like, Pirates of the Caribbean stuff.

1267
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:35,760
Oh!

And they're adding in this, like, pirate ship movement item, where, like, you basically What?!

00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,760
Yeah, I think you, like, summon a ghost pirate ship.

1270
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,280
You're gonna summon a ghost pirate ship?

1271
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,220
What the fuck?

1272
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,580
Yeah, yeah.

1273
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,340
Isn't that broken?

1274
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,560
Does that seem...

1275
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,420
Does that seem... Oh, that's why Fortnite Competitive is dead.

1276
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,300
Now...

1277
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,380
Don't say a lot of them in the back.

1278
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,060
Now I understand.

1279
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:08,340
Cause how the fuck do you balance a giant pirate ship?

1280
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,240
Like, how the fuck?

1281
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:11,580
Alright.

1282
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,340
Okay, I got... I think I got all the right stuff equipped right now.

1283
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,020
Okay.

1284
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,120
Oh, okay.

1285
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,140
Let me see what I can equip, too.

1286
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,720
I got Frieza.

1287
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:23,360
Alright.

1288
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,140
What are you doing in the back?

1289
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:25,740
For the back?

1290
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,140
Oh, for the back?

1291
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:27,600
Yeah, yeah.

1292
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,220
Oh, are you just gonna do...

1293
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,220
I have the oxygen tank.

1294
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,520
Oh, you have the oxygen tank?

1295
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:30,920
Okay.

1296
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:31,860
Do you have a crewmate?

1297
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,120
Like, the little amogus?

1298
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,220
No, I didn't buy it!

1299
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:41,900
Yeah, they... I think they have that for, like, when they start selling the game on Epic, I think.

1300
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,080
No!

1301
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,880
I don't have it!

1302
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,180
I have... let's see.

1303
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,560
I have... I'll put it on Baby Bender.

1304
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,420
Yo, you're gonna put Baby Bender?

1305
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,140
Oh, I have Baby Bender!

1306
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:51,900
I have that, too!

1307
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:59,520
I'm gonna put Baby Bender, and then my pickaxe is still gonna be... I'm gonna keep my pickaxe the same, cause I don't think we're gonna be using that much often.

1308
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:00,500
Yeah.

1309
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,780
Should I put on, uh, Yoda?

1310
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,000
I can put Yoda on my back.

1311
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,580
Oh, is he a Baby Yoda?

1312
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,160
Oh my god, Baby Bender!

1313
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:06,200
Yeah, oh, no, no.

1314
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,260
It's Grownass.

1315
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:07,940
Grownass.

1316
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:08,080
Oh, sorry.

1317
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,220
Grownass.

1318
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:10,220
Oh, man.

1319
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:10,700
Grownass Yoda.

1320
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,540
Oh, wait, what the fuck?

1321
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:16,380
Wait, how do I... how do I turn yourself back so I can see it?

1322
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:17,500
Is there a way?

1323
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:17,720
Oh, hold on.

1324
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,380
Wait, I can do an emote.

1325
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,220
Let me do an emote real quick.

1326
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,720
Okay, okay, I wanna see Baby Yoda.

1327
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,080
Or, like, Grownass Yoda.

1328
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,040
Wait, what was the emote that turns you around?

1329
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,160
Here we go.

1330
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,340
I think he'll jump on the back.

1331
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,080
What the...

1332
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,760
No, okay, never mind.

1333
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,060
He does not jump on the back.

1334
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,300
Wait, what about...

1335
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,380
Uh... this one?

1336
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,280
I can barely...

1337
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,060
I, like, sort of see it.

1338
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,740
I gotta find one where I just turn around.

1339
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,180
Where's the turn around one, chat?

1340
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,020
Oh, oh, oh.

1341
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:46,940
Oh, oh, oh.

1342
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,040
Oh, oh, oh.

1343
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,780
Oh, wait, did we get the next code?

1344
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,880
Oh, okay, we did.

1345
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,260
We got the next code?

1346
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,640
We did, we did, we got the next code.

1347
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:53,880
Okay.

1348
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,160
Uh...

1349
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,820
Let me enter the...

1350
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,220
We'll never see big Grownass Yoda.

1351
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,340
Okay, let me... Okay, I got it.

1352
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,260
Okay, go ahead and ready up.

1353
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:08,620
Alright.

1354
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,200
What else do I have?

1355
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,020
I have...

1356
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,960
I have the Macarena.

1357
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,640
What do you have?

1358
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,180
Wait, I have a two!

1359
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,160
No, you got a one!

1360
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:21,980
Let's fucking go!

1361
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,480
Let's fucking go!

1362
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,080
Bring back the Sarah!

1363
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:28,700
Oh my god!

1364
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:32,380
The moment I saw that in the store, I needed to have it.

1365
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,040
Have you actually watched that video again recently?

1366
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:40,540
Yeah, yo, no, did you watch the video where, like, they all got together and, like, recreated it?

1367
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,600
Yeah, they got together and recreated it!

1368
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,400
And you can see that it's not the same because they went corporate.

1369
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:50,480
Some of them became businessmen and women and you can see that the...

1370
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:53,160
You can see it's not as good as before.

1371
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,380
Life hit them hard.

1372
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,020
Corporate hit them hard.

1373
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,400
Wait, let me see if I can find it.

1374
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:01,300
Oh my god, wait, okay.

1375
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,900
What was it called?

1376
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,220
Was it a golf dance?

1377
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,080
Uh, it's called, uh, Infectious.

1378
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,380
Oh, it's the CyberGoth dance party!

1379
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,920
Okay, CyberGoth.

1380
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,060
They just weren't... Oh, it's called the video, right?

1381
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,380
CyberGoth dance reunion.

1382
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,340
And you can tell it's not the same.

1383
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:28,260
My boyfriend and I were talking about it the other day and we were like, dang, you know, everyone used to make fun of them back then and then the comment section changed to everyone vibing with them.

1384
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,500
Everybody was just like, god, I wish...

1385
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,020
I wish I could feel the joy they felt back then.

1386
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:33,800
Right?

1387
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,780
This is their soul.

1388
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:41,000
They didn't know when the moment they went became adults.

1389
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,100
Their soul was gone.

1390
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,780
Hey, would you type in CyberGoth party?

1391
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,200
CyberGoth dance.

1392
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,320
Uh...

1393
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:49,980
Reunion?

1394
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,080
I don't know.

1395
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:51,740
I don't remember.

1396
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:54,440
I saw like a video of it, but I don't know.

1397
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,540
I don't know where I found it.

1398
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,080
What was CyberGoth?

1399
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,480
CyberGoth dance reunion.

1400
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,580
I like how there's like a video of it that pops up called Gothrave at a funeral.

1401
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,840
Oh, there it is!

1402
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:09,640
There it is!

1403
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,200
I found it!

1404
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:10,740
I found it!

1405
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,280
I'm gonna link it.

1406
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:11,720
Oh, you found it?

1407
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:13,200
Yo, yo, send it, send it, send it.

1408
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,900
I'm gonna link it in my chat first and then I'll send it over.

1409
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,040
Alright, bet.

1410
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,440
Alright, I need to make sure I can send it.

1411
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,480
Guys, it's not the same.

1412
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:22,020
You can tell.

1413
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,120
You can tell.

1414
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,980
One of them is literally wearing a suit.

1415
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:25,960
You can tell.

1416
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:31,000
It's not... It's not the same.

1417
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,140
What is this, like a 10 year reunion?

1418
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,160
Oh my god, it's like 12 years later.

1419
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:39,820
That's crazy.

1420
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:44,060
This guy, one of them just came back from work and he's like, alright, don't worry.

1421
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,420
I'll be here.

1422
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:52,730
There's some very interesting results.

1423
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:55,650
I love seeing all these different things I'm like going through right now.

1424
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:59,270
That was 10 years ago.

1425
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:00,690
12 years ago!

1426
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:04,190
You can see it's not the same.

1427
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:06,490
It was before they got real jobs!

1428
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:08,610
Before they became adults!

1429
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:10,930
I never foresaw this ending.

1430
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:13,770
That guy in the fishnet shirt though, holy shit.

1431
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:15,870
I'm pulling up your stream.

1432
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:17,090
I gotta see it on your side.

1433
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:18,330
No, I'm not even looking.

1434
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:20,490
I'm not looking on stream.

1435
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:21,090
I'm just looking.

1436
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:24,250
This is on my other tab.

1437
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:25,910
They changed that.

1438
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:29,790
Reality hit them hard.

1439
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:32,910
And they became businessmen.

1440
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:36,550
They had to earn money.

1441
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:39,450
They had to make money.

1442
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,670
And pay taxes.

1443
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:43,490
Wait, this is them?

1444
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:44,730
Yeah, that's them.

1445
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:48,030
It's the reunion.

1446
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:54,360
They were sore for days after that.

1447
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,860
Yo, this is what's gonna give us power for the next game.

1448
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:58,840
Exactly, right here.

1449
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:03,860
We're gonna bring back Cyber Goth.

1450
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:05,380
What?

1451
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:07,140
We're bringing it back.

1452
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:09,260
Look at her.

1453
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:09,880
What?

1454
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:16,240
Oh my god, the main one at the front is the guy who was at the front of the other video.

1455
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,980
I think they were placed in the same spot, right?

1456
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:18,440
Yeah.

1457
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:21,240
That's so crazy.

1458
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,480
We're bringing it back.

1459
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:27,800
We gotta sync it up.

1460
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:32,440
A buddy in my chat said they're basically Fortnite skins.

1461
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,520
They're basically Fortnite skins.

1462
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:36,980
Wait, we gotta sync the dance.

1463
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:38,380
You guys ready to emote together?

1464
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,860
Yo, yo, we sync it?

1465
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,400
Okay, wait.

1466
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:42,800
Wait.

1467
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,280
3, 2, 1, go.

1468
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,660
3, 2, 1, go.

1469
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:48,920
No!

1470
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,120
I just defeated it!

1471
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:52,720
We got this, we got this.

1472
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:58,660
3, 2, 1, go.

1473
00:47:59,000 --> 00:47:59,860
3, 2, 1, go.

1474
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,900
No, we're so close!

1475
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,160
We're so close!

1476
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:10,520
Okay, 3, 2, 1, go.

1477
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,160
Yes!

1478
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:15,240
Let's fucking go!

1479
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:17,980
Oh my god!

1480
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,480
We looked so good!

1481
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:21,980
We even synced on my end.

1482
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,080
We even synced on my end.

1483
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,260
As long as it synced on someone's side, that's all that matters.

1484
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:28,900
It's like two in the frame.

1485
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,960
It's actually like perfect.

1486
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:36,000
We're gonna bring back Cyber God with Dragon Ball Z!

1487
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,100
Yeah, this is the revival here.

1488
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,220
The revival is coming.

1489
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:40,400
It's happening.

1490
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,900
I think it's great that we used Dragon Ball Z skins for Cyber God.

1491
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,620
I also just love that you're running like Baby Bender on your back.

1492
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:53,420
You have adult Yoda and I have Baby Bender.

1493
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,180
Wait, what other ones do you have?

1494
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,600
Let me see if I have like...

1495
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,000
I wish you had like Baby Yoda.

1496
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,260
Oh my god, why does he look like that?

1497
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:01,960
Is this like...

1498
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:04,480
Yoda looks so fucking off.

1499
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:05,600
I know, right?

1500
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:08,420
He looks like a Korean old man.

1501
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:10,300
He's literally Star Wars.

1502
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,220
He's literally an old man.

1503
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:13,840
He's just an old man on my back.

1504
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,340
It's like Goku...

1505
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:18,660
You're Luke Skywalker, but Goku.

1506
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,900
Are you playing with pretty graphics on your game?

1507
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:22,900
I'm playing on medium.

1508
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,000
Oh, you're playing... I'm so jealous.

1509
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,820
I play on like ugly sweaty graphics.

1510
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:28,440
So everything doesn't look as nice.

1511
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,600
Let me do it again.

1512
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,580
I know my play so I can play medium.

1513
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:36,920
There's no point in putting it on low.

1514
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,020
I know there's...

1515
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:41,200
I know there's no point in putting it on low.

1516
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:43,940
I'm literally gonna get shit on no matter what.

1517
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,620
Your new model looks so good.

1518
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,220
My new skin suit.

1519
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:50,880
Look at how your new skin suit looks.

1520
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:52,500
That's so good.

1521
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,180
Oh, we're starting.

1522
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:53,720
We're starting.

1523
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:55,460
Are we going in?

1524
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:58,200
Hey guys, is the volume a lot better now, chat?

1525
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:02,860
By the way, my usual sound guy, he's at Evo right now.

1526
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:03,760
So...

1527
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,460
What game is he playing at Evo?

1528
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:05,980
I don't know.

1529
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:11,980
That's why he's like, oh sorry, I can't do sound check.

1530
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,300
Look at my Yoda.

1531
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,440
Oh my god.

1532
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,520
Get rid of that crown.

1533
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Yeah, I got rid of it.

1534
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:21,440
I got rid of it.

1535
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,880
Okay, you remember our Josh Plot, yeah?

1536
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:26,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1537
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,160
We're pretty far from it.

1538
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,820
We got some time.

1539
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:30,600
We're chillin'.

1540
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:32,840
We're chillin'.

1541
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:33,820
Look at this battle bus.

1542
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:34,760
We're literally vibing.

1543
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,920
Okay, don't worry.

1544
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,700
I'm gonna adjust the sound now, guys.

1545
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:39,780
Sound effects.

1546
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:40,660
Music.

1547
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:42,500
Sound effects.

1548
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,580
That should be better now.

1549
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:46,500
Alright, drop now.

1550
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:47,820
Just in time.

1551
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:49,640
Yay!

1552
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:51,980
Maybe you'll land a little short, too.

1553
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:53,900
We have all this side, so we should be okay.

1554
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:57,260
I'm gonna land right here, but you should pop your parachute now.

1555
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1556
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,340
My parachute is the dragon.

1557
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,580
Oh, you're using the dragon?

1558
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:03,980
I'm using fucking Nike kicks.

1559
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:04,540
What?

1560
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:07,400
Why?

1561
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,580
I see the fucking shoes.

1562
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:15,880
I am playing on 60 frames.

1563
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:17,100
Why am I on 60 frames?

1564
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,260
Oh, it doesn't matter.

1565
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:20,940
Oh my god, Yoda is laughing.

1566
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,900
It is weirding me out right now.

1567
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:24,360
Alright, let's see.

1568
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:26,980
Alright, let's see.

1569
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,180
I'm grabbing the guns.

1570
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,840
Oh my god, it's so weird seeing, like, all these footstep icons.

1571
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,400
Yoda is really, really creeping me out.

1572
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,220
Yoda's creeping you out just looking at him, staring at you.

1573
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:40,600
No, he makes sounds.

1574
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:42,660
He goes like Wait, does he actually?

1575
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:43,200
Yeah.

1576
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:44,220
That's looking weird.

1577
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,740
Yoda, that's fucking cringe.

1578
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,860
Yoda, you got something cringey.

1579
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,240
Yeah, don't be cringe, Yoda.

1580
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,180
We're trying to play a tournament right now.

1581
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,520
I'm thinking of our croissant.

1582
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:57,760
Yeah, wait, there's a little crash thingy.

1583
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,060
There's a plunger gun here.

1584
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:02,780
Oh, that gun is so nasty.

1585
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,380
No, you should use it.

1586
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:06,820
No, it's hitscan.

1587
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,300
It's so good.

1588
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:07,900
That's a plunger gun.

1589
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:11,140
Oh, the gun that you pinged?

1590
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:11,800
Oh, that one.

1591
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,180
Okay.

1592
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,400
The one next to it?

1593
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,160
The one next to it is nasty, though.

1594
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:15,660
It's so good.

1595
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:17,380
Oh, there's a gun next to it?

1596
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:17,900
Yeah.

1597
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:20,680
That gun is so good.

1598
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:21,680
Wait, I'll give it to you.

1599
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:22,480
No, you should use it.

1600
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,520
You know how to use this.

1601
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:24,760
There's that?

1602
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:26,600
Yeah, you use it.

1603
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:27,940
I'll get the grab there.

1604
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,660
No, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

1605
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:30,680
I don't know.

1606
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,160
I mean, I kinda know what I'm doing.

1607
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:33,900
You don't even know what this gun is.

1608
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,460
I was like, what the fuck is this gun?

1609
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,160
Alright, here, I'm gonna splash this in.

1610
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:40,620
Actually, no, you pop that big pot.

1611
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:42,140
Pop the big pot.

1612
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:44,060
And then I'm gonna finish doing this.

1613
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:45,640
What is this gun?

1614
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:46,360
I'm drinking.

1615
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:47,940
I'm sipping my thing.

1616
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:48,520
Oh, we're in zone.

1617
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:49,200
That's good.

1618
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,040
Oh my god, we're hella in zone, too.

1619
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:51,680
We're chillin'.

1620
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,900
How was I locked in 60?

1621
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:55,500
What the fuck?

1622
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,520
I didn't even realize.

1623
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:58,260
Were you locked in 60 FPS?

1624
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:59,660
Yeah, I was locked in 60.

1625
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,340
I swear I, like, changed it.

1626
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:04,580
I wonder if the settings actually reset for you.

1627
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:06,780
I wasn't sure if it would, like, do it or not.

1628
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,460
No, it, like, half reset.

1629
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:14,560
So, like, I had to fix some of the stuff, but, like, I remember changing it past 60.

1630
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:15,640
Oh my god.

1631
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:17,200
We're so much more fluid now.

1632
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,900
Okay, you see this shield bubble?

1633
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:20,480
Yeah.

1634
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:21,120
That is pink?

1635
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,420
Okay, like, did you ever play Halo back then?

1636
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:24,380
Oh, actually, no.

1637
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:25,720
Better yet, this is like a fucking Gibby bubble.

1638
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,700
You literally throw it at your feet and it basically protects you.

1639
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:29,340
Okay, that's good.

1640
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:30,560
I think it's like 10 seconds.

1641
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:31,260
There's another one there.

1642
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,220
What gun is this?

1643
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:33,800
Is that a rifle?

1644
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,100
Yeah, they're all hitscan, too.

1645
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:36,820
Okay, that's good.

1646
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,540
I have all jumping stuff.

1647
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:41,780
Wait, we have to move again.

1648
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:43,320
Oh, we have to go past Dusty.

1649
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,000
Okay, so we can go over here.

1650
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:45,860
We're gonna go towards the condo.

1651
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:46,960
Whoa, we gotta do this.

1652
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:47,180
Nice.

1653
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:48,840
Yeah, we gotta do it for good luck.

1654
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,140
Where is it?

1655
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:50,560
Where's my...

1656
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,560
We're doing it for good luck, guys.

1657
00:53:58,580 --> 00:53:59,280
We need this.

1658
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,920
We are also not the last team again, by the way.

1659
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:04,480
Okay, nice.

1660
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,000
We're not last.

1661
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:06,580
We are not dead last.

1662
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,820
Alright, let's go...

1663
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:12,480
Yeah, I guess go down here.

1664
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:13,440
I don't even have a shotgun.

1665
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:14,100
This is terrible.

1666
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,200
Oh, no.

1667
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:16,420
It's okay.

1668
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,120
We're not last.

1669
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:18,100
We're not last.

1670
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:20,040
We're not last.

1671
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:21,020
Just be thankful.

1672
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:24,400
Let's see.

1673
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:25,160
Is there...

1674
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:25,900
Oh, we got movement.

1675
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:26,420
Okay, sweet.

1676
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,440
So, I have these jumpy pads that are... Yeah.

1677
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,360
I have jump pads, too.

1678
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:31,440
Oh, yeah, those, too.

1679
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,680
Oh, in front of us?

1680
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,080
I'm gonna back up real quick.

1681
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:34,500
Whoa.

1682
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:35,440
I'm gonna do this.

1683
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,240
Pause on this.

1684
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:36,620
Oh, God.

1685
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:37,840
Wait, I got knocked already?

1686
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:38,780
Oh, actually, I'm gonna bleed out.

1687
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,060
Run away from me.

1688
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:40,300
Run away.

1689
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:40,900
Use the jumpy pad.

1690
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:42,000
What the fuck?

1691
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:43,820
No!

1692
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:44,600
No!

1693
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:46,120
No!

1694
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,200
I'm saving it!

1695
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:48,280
The condom skins!

1696
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:49,900
No!

1697
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:51,020
No!

1698
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:53,380
I got shot before I could even see them.

1699
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:58,660
Like, I was literally out of LOS, and I literally died because of ping around the corner.

1700
00:54:58,820 --> 00:54:58,900
Oh, no!

1701
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:03,980
It's because they land next to us, so their condom men are always gonna be there.

1702
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:08,140
Okay, now that I know they're gonna do that, I'm gonna literally play hyper-aggressive.

1703
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,920
Like, I am confident I can definitely kill one of them.

1704
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:11,260
I believe.

1705
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:11,940
I believe.

1706
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:12,480
I believe in you.

1707
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,340
Alright, don't worry.

1708
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,360
Now we can talk strategy.

1709
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:21,280
So, the strat is gonna be that we literally kill these guys.

1710
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,080
That is the strat.

1711
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:23,660
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1712
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,920
Yeah, we gotta swap.

1713
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:30,020
We didn't get a chance to use more of Dragon Ball Z, so we gotta keep going.

1714
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:32,620
We gotta swap Dragon Ball Z characters.

1715
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:35,180
Goku and Frieza just were not it.

1716
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,400
They were not it.

1717
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,760
They were raving a little too hard, but not hard enough.

1718
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,720
Yeah, yeah, we gotta do different Dragon Ball Z characters.

1719
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,800
I have Cell and you have Vegeta, right?

1720
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,640
Yeah, I have Vegeta.

1721
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,440
We'll go Vegeta and Cell.

1722
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,300
They're better than Goku and Frieza.

1723
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:05,620
So, seeing how this team is playing though, I think usually what ends up happening, it's kinda like how Apex is, where once you get a feel for the team that lands next to your POI, they'll basically play off of that.

1724
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,820
And this team knows that we're being very evasive.

1725
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:15,200
So, what we'll do is that we'll be ready for whatever angles they're gonna hold, and we'll just play counter-aggressive on them.

1726
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:28,560
And if the zone ends up pulling where we have to run past them again, we can do a thing where we go towards the Loot Lake house on the island, and then we can rotate from there.

1727
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:35,640
They're probably gonna either look for us from where we usually rotate, or they're just gonna not even mind us and deal with the team to the right.

1728
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,440
And I think that'll be the plan.

1729
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:39,360
I think that'll be the plan.

1730
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,220
I have no idea what you said, but I agree.

1731
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:47,660
I'll just follow you.

1732
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:50,040
Just nod your head and say yes.

1733
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,720
And then we'll be like, yeah, yeah, yeah, we're good, we're good.

1734
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:53,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1735
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:59,900
From everything I heard from what you said, I just need to follow you.

1736
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:01,020
Okay, I got that.

1737
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:01,760
I understand.

1738
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:10,360
I think what I should've probably did, though, too, is just been like, oh, just give me bubble me if I go down.

1739
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,420
Oh, that's true.

1740
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:13,300
That's on me.

1741
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:14,880
I didn't even say any of that.

1742
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:18,000
No, I'm pretty sure they would've killed us because they were there so fast.

1743
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:21,860
They also had shockwaves ready for the moment they got a knock.

1744
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,860
We just got unlucky on our way.

1745
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:26,400
Sweats, condom men.

1746
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,040
What are these guys doing?

1747
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,840
It could be anything else, and you chose condom men.

1748
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,500
Look at this team on top of the hill.

1749
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:43,000
They're probably some very colorful Fortnite skins, and these guys are like, yeah, we're gonna eat a condom.

1750
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:49,580
Fortnite made billions of dollars off of skin cells, and you decide to be condoms?

1751
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:54,040
Condoms are, I guess, the new thing.

1752
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,520
They're not even a good skin.

1753
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,620
They look so ugly.

1754
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:02,500
Say it louder for the people in the back.

1755
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:04,900
Say it louder for the people in the back.

1756
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,960
Is it because it's hard to see them?

1757
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:07,860
I don't understand.

1758
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:08,920
What's the appeal?

1759
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:10,880
It's pretty much that.

1760
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:14,660
If you're playing on ultra-pretty graphics, it's harder to see them.

1761
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:19,300
Also, it's a very minimal slim hitbox skin.

1762
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:22,580
Wait, it affects the hitbox?

1763
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,380
I think it's like four different hitbox sizes in the game.

1764
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,080
Wait, this is sweaty wraith skin.

1765
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:33,640
The reason why people play the bald wraith is because of the smaller hitbox.

1766
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,040
Yup, yup.

1767
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:36,520
It's very much that.

1768
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,900
This is a fucking scam!

1769
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:39,300
It's pay to win!

1770
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:41,680
Oh, these guys are gonna fight?

1771
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,260
What the fuck is this tree?

1772
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:44,420
Wait, you can grow a tree?

1773
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:47,660
What?

1774
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:49,260
Wait, what?

1775
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,280
Why are they growing a tree?

1776
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,320
Condoms vs condoms!

1777
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:52,640
What?

1778
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,300
Who the fuck?

1779
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:56,720
You can grow trees?

1780
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,420
Is this Mr. Beast?

1781
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,200
Yo, what?

1782
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:01,860
Mr. Beast growing trees?

1783
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:03,580
Yeah, is this Mr. Beast growing the trees?

1784
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,120
They have the Mr. Beast skin, right?

1785
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:05,440
Yeah!

1786
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:09,600
Wait, did you see what happened to them?

1787
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:10,640
You saw how they got jumped?

1788
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:13,220
It's like what we almost did to them last game.

1789
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,960
Oh, they're probably gonna die here!

1790
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:16,660
They might die here.

1791
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:17,080
Oh, no.

1792
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,220
Wait, they're resetting?

1793
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,600
Okay, so, you know how you respawn?

1794
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,260
As long as one person's alive?

1795
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:23,900
Yeah.

1796
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:27,820
No, what I did was you can choose to bleed out very fast.

1797
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:30,100
So that way it respawns you faster.

1798
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:30,680
Oh!

1799
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:38,340
So if you feel like it's just gonna be like a sucky situation, you can just like say, alright, I'm out, bye, and then just respawn.

1800
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:41,180
But like, I have to live long enough.

1801
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:42,360
Yeah, yeah.

1802
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:42,920
What the fuck?

1803
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:43,860
How do you keep growing trees?

1804
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,760
Why are they still planting?

1805
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,720
Because they're Mr. Beast and it's a condom.

1806
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:54,360
What was that Mr. Beast growing trees thing that he did?

1807
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:59,280
Yeah, that was like, I planted a bajillion trees in like some country or whatever.

1808
00:59:59,560 --> 00:59:59,820
Yeah, yeah.

1809
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:00,660
What was it called again?

1810
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:02,840
They're Team Trees!

1811
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,300
They're fucking Team Trees!

1812
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:05,620
Yo, Team Trees?

1813
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,320
Oh my god, I'm gonna burn some plastic to counteract this.

1814
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:16,540
If you can plant trees in Fortnite, you should be able to burn plastic.

1815
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,160
Oh my god.

1816
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:19,340
Yo, yo.

1817
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:21,860
Keep burning plastic out of here.

1818
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:25,540
It should be like the nerf to the tree thing.

1819
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:28,700
In game, guys.

1820
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:29,880
It's all in game.

1821
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:33,800
Aaron's like, why would you do that, Dopey?

1822
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:39,240
Like, if these guys are gonna plant trees, we just wanna burn the plastic in the game.

1823
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:39,380
Yeah!

1824
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:43,700
Burn the plastic to counteract all the trees that they're planting!

1825
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:46,140
It's crazy.

1826
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:51,420
For anyone wondering, hitboxing is a myth?

1827
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:52,600
Oh no, that's true.

1828
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:52,960
That's true.

1829
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:57,040
Cause like, I think there's like three or four body types in Fortnite.

1830
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,640
I don't think it actually changes the hitbox.

1831
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:03,140
Oh yeah, cause Peter Griffin has a different Peter Griffin's definitely not the same hitbox as this.

1832
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:05,580
Yeah, he's like There's no way.

1833
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:06,300
Gigantic.

1834
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:07,740
Wait, do you have the chicken?

1835
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,740
I do have the chicken, I have the chicken.

1836
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:09,960
You have the chicken?

1837
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:10,640
I have Peter!

1838
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:11,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1839
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,400
Yo, we could do the chicken and Peter.

1840
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:13,960
Oh my god, we could do the chicken and the chicken!

1841
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:17,180
Okay, we gotta do it on like game four or something like that.

1842
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,580
Unless we wanna do it next game.

1843
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:19,080
No, no, no.

1844
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:24,800
We'll do Peter and the chicken next game, and then game four, we'll bring back Dragon Ball.

1845
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:25,940
Alright, I'm down.

1846
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:26,400
I'm down.

1847
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:30,060
Someone's like, they're playing wide hitbox, they want to lose.

1848
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:32,520
Oh, what do you mean that?

1849
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:33,700
That's like the Giga Chat move.

1850
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:35,920
Everyone's gonna respect that.

1851
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,200
They're gonna be like, oh, I do not wanna mess with the chicken and Peter Griffin.

1852
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,100
They see our skins and they're just like, oh, they definitely don't know what they're doing.

1853
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:47,340
We can definitely farm them.

1854
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:52,560
Oh my god, I love how like, where nearly everyone is with their jumps.

1855
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:55,080
Holy shit, these guys are sweat.

1856
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:59,240
No wonder my three Fortnite pro players fucking dodged me.

1857
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:03,520
Wait, they're all condom skins!

1858
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:04,580
Jesus!

1859
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:06,180
It's 500!

1860
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:08,320
Oh my god!

1861
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:10,780
They're all condom skins.

1862
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:22,640
I love how like, Fortnite compared to Apex is like the strat still 1v1 fight is running in circles to get a right hand peek on someone.

1863
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:23,640
That's literally Fortnite.

1864
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:24,520
Yeah.

1865
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,320
Oh, I got it.

1866
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:32,360
Are we the only one that's not running the skin?

1867
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:38,300
Everyone's running some like, condom skin and we're just like very, very colorful chickens.

1868
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:40,520
They definitely know where to find us.

1869
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:41,360
That's for sure.

1870
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:45,260
These look like NPCs fighting.

1871
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:45,900
They do.

1872
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:48,100
They naturally do.

1873
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,780
They look like NPCs.

1874
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,920
They say, I don't wanna be the main character.

1875
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,460
I'm just gonna be I'm gonna be an NPC.

1876
01:02:58,760 --> 01:02:59,900
Oh my god.

1877
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:01,700
Oh, reboots are disabled now.

1878
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:02,640
Another condom?

1879
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:06,380
Yeah, we're playing an attorney so everyone I think wants to be a condom.

1880
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:09,000
Yeah, everybody wants to be the condom players.

1881
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:11,700
What the fuck?

1882
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,220
There she is, one of them.

1883
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:16,320
Please show me somebody that's not a condom.

1884
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,920
Yeah, I'm gonna actually cycle through all the players.

1885
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:20,180
Oh, I got someone who's not a condom.

1886
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:20,860
Wait, who, who?

1887
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:23,200
Who is this?

1888
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:24,260
Oh my god, this guy!

1889
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:24,960
Jade?

1890
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:28,760
Wait, they're all they're all like, they have same skin.

1891
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,000
Ew, there's another green condom.

1892
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:32,400
Why are they all growing trees?

1893
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:36,200
Oh, these are the like OG sweat skins.

1894
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:37,680
Oh wait, there's more.

1895
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,320
Wait, can I cycle through the next one?

1896
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:44,960
Is this like a fucking skill?

1897
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:47,040
Why do some of them have trees growing?

1898
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:47,680
Or are they hiding in a tree?

1899
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:48,880
Oh, these ones have like cat ears.

1900
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:51,820
Let's see.

1901
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:53,540
Oh hey!

1902
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:54,820
This is green condom.

1903
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:00,110
This one has green condom.

1904
01:04:01,810 --> 01:04:03,630
Whoa, these chicks are from the witcher.

1905
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:04,190
I think.

1906
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:12,370
Okay, so there's like witcher skins, and then there's some like cat ear skins that I can't find.

1907
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:13,810
Oh my god, they're all the same skin!

1908
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:16,710
Fucking beta male shit!

1909
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:21,690
Why could you do fiend?

1910
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:22,910
Be more fun!

1911
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:27,590
Oh, a condom's dead!

1912
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:29,290
Okay, same skin?

1913
01:04:29,530 --> 01:04:32,430
That's so like, that's so like 2002.

1914
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:38,270
Whatever happened to not being a condom?

1915
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:40,730
I remember back in the good old days when no one wanted to be a condom.

1916
01:04:40,870 --> 01:04:41,270
This is lazy.

1917
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:42,610
Lazy, lazy teamwork.

1918
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:43,250
They're growing trees again.

1919
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:47,370
I'm gonna literally use that call out now because of you.

1920
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:49,250
You're like, I'm growing trees?

1921
01:04:49,410 --> 01:04:50,070
I'm growing trees?

1922
01:04:50,330 --> 01:04:50,770
I'm growing trees.

1923
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:53,070
Where's the individuality?

1924
01:04:53,750 --> 01:05:00,990
This is what like, the other players that bailed on you missed out on, is like new call out that no one else is gonna know.

1925
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:01,770
Exactly.

1926
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:04,050
You're just inventing new slang.

1927
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:10,230
I swear, it's not fair, like why can't I burn plastic in Fortnite if I can grow trees?

1928
01:05:11,090 --> 01:05:13,470
Like, we should, it should be perfectly balanced.

1929
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:18,210
Wait, what?

1930
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:20,130
Oh, okay, it's the witcher skins again.

1931
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:21,070
Oh, nice.

1932
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:21,850
Okay.

1933
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:23,490
I respect this team.

1934
01:05:23,570 --> 01:05:23,950
Who is this?

1935
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:24,690
Oh, they're all anonymous.

1936
01:05:27,810 --> 01:05:28,810
What the fuck?

1937
01:05:29,610 --> 01:05:31,130
I think these are witcher skins.

1938
01:05:31,310 --> 01:05:32,590
Are these guys from witcher?

1939
01:05:32,590 --> 01:05:33,910
All of them are same skin!

1940
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:37,650
None of them are like they're all actually same skin!

1941
01:05:38,070 --> 01:05:38,950
Holy shit!

1942
01:05:39,090 --> 01:05:41,790
Everybody that's alive is wearing the same thing.

1943
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:44,450
So boring.

1944
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:47,970
This is why Fortnite is competitive instead.

1945
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:53,790
I've been asked so many times, like, why don't I play competitive in this game?

1946
01:05:53,870 --> 01:05:57,230
I'm like, I like playing this game in a very, very dumb manner.

1947
01:05:57,390 --> 01:06:01,550
I like it for all the the giant toonie chicken skins.

1948
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:02,250
Yeah!

1949
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:03,630
And I like WP.

1950
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:08,870
You play Fortnite competitive, all you see are these dumb, dumb condom skins in different colors.

1951
01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:16,470
Then there's also, like, this is zero build, but everyone still builds ramps.

1952
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:20,730
Cause there's fucking they should, they should be able to remove items like Smash Brothers.

1953
01:06:21,230 --> 01:06:24,630
That's what I've always said, I'm just like, yo, remove that shit.

1954
01:06:24,870 --> 01:06:29,770
Like, you know how, like, in competitive Apex, they remove like, all the, uh, what is it called?

1955
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:30,310
The...

1956
01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:31,870
the heat shields?

1957
01:06:32,270 --> 01:06:32,690
Yeah!

1958
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:33,670
The heat shields are removed?

1959
01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:34,170
Yeah.

1960
01:06:34,170 --> 01:06:36,050
But Portabunga should be removed!

1961
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:44,190
I'm pretty sure they are modifiable, but, like, I think they just leave them because they want it to be, like, how it is in the regular mode?

1962
01:06:44,370 --> 01:06:44,910
I don't even know.

1963
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:45,030
Yeah!

1964
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:51,210
They couldn't... Fortnite could can have even more... Fortnite competitive can have more sponsors.

1965
01:06:51,530 --> 01:06:54,870
And they force all of them to wear, like, funny skins.

1966
01:06:56,690 --> 01:06:59,050
No, I would do that tournament in a heartbeat.

1967
01:06:59,490 --> 01:07:02,470
They're like, no, no sweat skins, no matching skins.

1968
01:07:02,590 --> 01:07:03,690
You have to be all different.

1969
01:07:03,950 --> 01:07:05,090
Yeah, everybody...

1970
01:07:05,090 --> 01:07:07,510
You know how, like, you gotta claim your drop spot?

1971
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:08,910
You gotta claim your skin.

1972
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:09,530
Yeah, yeah.

1973
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:14,430
Each person has to have a different skin, so you gotta claim whichever skin you're wearing, so...

1974
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:18,450
Yo... Yo, I'm... Okay, I think you're cooking right now.

1975
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:19,710
People wanna watch Fortnite rake more.

1976
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:21,930
I think you're actually cooking.

1977
01:07:21,930 --> 01:07:22,970
You're cooking something, Doki.

1978
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:26,570
Is this the next tournament that's gonna happen?

1979
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:29,110
Like, I would actually do a tournament like that.

1980
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:30,210
That would be so fucking fun.

1981
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:39,950
That's like, literally free advertisement with, like, for the other pieces... Like, imagine, like, the person wearing the weekend skin won, like, a million dollar Fortnite bucks.

1982
01:07:40,370 --> 01:07:43,850
Like, and then, like, you know, the weekend get, like, free advertisement.

1983
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:45,430
And then, like...

1984
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:48,330
And then people will be like, well, I want to wear the weekend skin!

1985
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:50,050
And then people will...

1986
01:07:50,050 --> 01:07:53,390
And then all the little kitties are gonna buy the weekend skin even more!

1987
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:56,990
Yo... Okay, okay, no, no, no.

1988
01:07:57,070 --> 01:07:57,630
On the real?

1989
01:07:57,790 --> 01:08:03,550
Okay, I'm, like, I'm even thinking, what if you do that and, like, you force everyone to not use any of these items, right?

1990
01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:05,210
Like, it's all, like, just movement items.

1991
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:08,870
All, like, things that just add more chaos to the mix.

1992
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:11,970
That would be so stupid fun.

1993
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:12,290
Yeah!

1994
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:12,290
Exactly!

1995
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:13,290
That would be so fun.

1996
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:16,470
Just, you know, just remove all items in general.

1997
01:08:16,570 --> 01:08:16,970
Just...

1998
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:26,050
The thing is, the reason why they need this is because Fortnite is such an open map in general.

1999
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:27,670
They don't have enough cover.

2000
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:29,190
Unlike Apex or...

2001
01:08:29,190 --> 01:08:34,510
Unlike Apex and other FPS games, maps are designed to have cover.

2002
01:08:34,690 --> 01:08:38,510
Fortnite is designed to not have cover because they expect you to make your cover.

2003
01:08:38,970 --> 01:08:41,430
Yeah, so 0-bill players just go through it.

2004
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:43,110
They need to have the bunker, yeah.

2005
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:45,650
They need the bunkers.

2006
01:08:46,610 --> 01:08:48,310
Look at this nerd, he downed himself.

2007
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:50,970
Oh!

2008
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:52,910
Condom dead!

2009
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:54,650
A non-condom team won!

2010
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:57,750
Yeah, but they have the same skin, don't they?

2011
01:08:57,990 --> 01:08:59,450
Are they wearing the same skin together?

2012
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:01,190
I think they are, yeah.

2013
01:09:01,550 --> 01:09:01,930
No!

2014
01:09:05,470 --> 01:09:06,110
It's okay.

2015
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:10,790
As long as there's no condom winners, we all win.

2016
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:15,570
They go against the meta!

2017
01:09:15,950 --> 01:09:17,130
They go against the meta!

2018
01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:18,310
That's all that matters.

2019
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:19,950
Okay, I put Peter Griffin on.

2020
01:09:20,050 --> 01:09:21,510
Alright, I'm putting the chicken on.

2021
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:22,830
It's time to be a chicken.

2022
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:25,350
Let's see what dance...

2023
01:09:25,350 --> 01:09:28,110
Is there any cool dances on the store?

2024
01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:30,070
Oh, let me change...

2025
01:09:30,070 --> 01:09:30,930
It's time to shop.

2026
01:09:31,230 --> 01:09:32,010
My emotes.

2027
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:32,970
Wait, do you have Batman later?

2028
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:35,270
Uhhh...

2029
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:36,130
Do you have Batman?

2030
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:38,790
The skin?

2031
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:40,130
Or like the emotes?

2032
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:41,770
No, I don't have Batman.

2033
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:43,710
No, because I have the Batman who laughs.

2034
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:46,270
Oh, that's getting sick.

2035
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:47,990
Wait, I have Mr. Beast!

2036
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:52,960
Oh, I bought Mr. Beast!

2037
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,220
Oh my god!

2038
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,220
I forgot it was in the store!

2039
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,080
I was like, I gotta have Mr. Beast.

2040
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:01,340
Oh my god.

2041
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:06,060
Wait, if we find the trees, I wanna be Mr. Beast and plant the trees.

2042
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:10,600
I don't care if we die, I just wanna plant some trees.

2043
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:14,600
Okay, one of these rounds, we have to do Mr. Beast and someone else.

2044
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:15,120
Who would I be?

2045
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:16,000
Who would you be?

2046
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:18,940
Chat, who would match with Mr. Beast?

2047
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:20,800
Who would match with Mr. Beast, guys?

2048
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:23,080
Let's see, let's see.

2049
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:24,120
Go, Peter, go!

2050
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:27,400
I'm like watching him dance right now.

2051
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:29,660
Neo?

2052
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:32,720
Is there another YouTuber?

2053
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,600
Is there another YouTuber skin that you have?

2054
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:36,740
Let me see, let me see.

2055
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:39,260
There is...

2056
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:41,100
Oh, I guess I could be like Caby Lane.

2057
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,420
The guy who does the shrug?

2058
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:47,540
You know, he's really big on TikTok.

2059
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:49,100
He does the shrugging all the time.

2060
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:49,960
Wait, wait, wait, okay.

2061
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:50,880
Oh my god, Peter!

2062
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,480
Oh my, I'm looking at like the different emotes.

2063
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:55,180
Like the emotes that I could get.

2064
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:55,940
What the fuck?

2065
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,920
Oh my god, wait, I need to buy this.

2066
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:01,180
Give me a sec, I'm gonna hide my screen.

2067
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:02,000
Yeah, yeah, you're good, you're good, you're good.

2068
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,200
Guys, I need to buy this, guys.

2069
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:03,840
I need...

2070
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,340
I have to buy this.

2071
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:09,220
Okay, I'm gonna equip.

2072
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:09,800
Nice!

2073
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:11,940
Okay.

2074
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:13,560
What's this?

2075
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:17,280
Oh my god, he's fucking shredding it!

2076
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:18,420
Oh my god!

2077
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:19,340
I have so many!

2078
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:20,080
I have so many anime skins.

2079
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,920
Okay, wait, wait, show me the other YouTuber.

2080
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:23,320
The other YouTuber?

2081
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:27,160
Dang, he's partially on YouTube.

2082
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:28,980
He's like more TikTok, but...

2083
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:29,720
This guy.

2084
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:34,080
Oh, wasn't he banned on YouTube?

2085
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:35,080
Yeah.

2086
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:35,960
Wait, did he get banned on YouTube?

2087
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:38,460
I don't remember, I remember he got banned somewhere.

2088
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:39,020
Or was it Twitter?

2089
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,640
Oh, I know, I know!

2090
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:42,500
Wait, how the fuck did he get a...

2091
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:46,640
How did he get a Fortnite skin?

2092
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:49,080
I don't know, I'm just a wolf.

2093
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:50,140
Bro, somebody...

2094
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:52,520
Bro, somebody must really...

2095
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:55,600
Somebody at Fortnite must really, really like this guy!

2096
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:58,960
Just don't expect him to get a Fortnite skin.

2097
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:03,040
Wait, what other guys do they have?

2098
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,040
Let's see, do I have another YouTuber?

2099
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,680
Oh, I'm going through all these.

2100
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:09,200
Um...

2101
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:09,840
Alright, wait.

2102
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:10,660
I don't know if I have another...

2103
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:13,860
I mean, I might have like a gamer YouTuber, but...

2104
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:14,680
I don't have like...

2105
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:15,820
I'm like Mr. Beast.

2106
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:17,280
Look who I got.

2107
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,360
Wait, who you got, who you got?

2108
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:19,900
Look who I bought.

2109
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:22,280
Look at him go!

2110
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:23,760
Yo, I have the emote!

2111
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:27,520
Oh, do you get the new code?

2112
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:28,840
Oh, we just got a new code, hold on.

2113
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:29,000
Okay.

2114
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,780
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam!

2115
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,120
Did you guys hear that chat?

2116
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:37,380
Fortnite killer!

2117
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:41,180
Oh yeah, I should...

2118
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:42,040
No one is ready.

2119
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:44,580
I should change some of my emotes too.

2120
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:45,860
Uh...

2121
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:47,600
Emotes, okay, what do I...

2122
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:48,660
I want to keep the Macarena.

2123
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:53,040
Oh, Christmas tree skin for Mr. Beast.

2124
01:12:54,940 --> 01:12:56,220
Oh, that's true!

2125
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:56,820
You should be a tree!

2126
01:12:57,180 --> 01:12:57,880
You should be a tree!

2127
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:58,660
Yeah, I can be a tree.

2128
01:12:58,680 --> 01:12:59,560
I have a Christmas tree.

2129
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:01,640
Okay, I need...

2130
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:02,640
Where's the...

2131
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:06,380
What's that emote called again?

2132
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:08,200
Which one?

2133
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:09,600
The one you were just doing.

2134
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:12,920
Oh, Master Puppets, okay.

2135
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,740
Yeah, it should be at the top.

2136
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:16,060
Wait, where's the...

2137
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,000
Where's the fucking... Oh, there it is.

2138
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,080
Okay, I got it, I got it.

2139
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:21,520
I gotta make sure this is in there.

2140
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:23,680
You have it?

2141
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:24,340
Okay, let's go.

2142
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:32,040
Look at the guitar!

2143
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:34,320
It's like out of his skin.

2144
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:38,060
His body is so fucking massive.

2145
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,360
It's so fucking big.

2146
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:41,840
Oh my god.

2147
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,380
I'm winning in spirit.

2148
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:52,120
Look at his, like, giant toonie eyes.

2149
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:53,580
What the fuck?

2150
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:55,260
How many emotes do you have?

2151
01:13:55,660 --> 01:13:56,960
I have way too many.

2152
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:58,560
You don't even wanna know all that I have.

2153
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:01,860
Oh wait, that's the witcher!

2154
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:03,040
Which one?

2155
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:03,300
This one?

2156
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:04,260
No, the bathtub.

2157
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:05,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2158
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:05,820
Is that the witcher?

2159
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:06,520
Oh, is that from the witcher?

2160
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:08,920
Did he take a bath?

2161
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,660
Yeah, he takes a bath in that thing.

2162
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:11,060
Yeah.

2163
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:13,380
I had no idea.

2164
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:14,720
Oh my god, I feel so concerned.

2165
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:15,800
I thought that was the witcher.

2166
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:18,860
This is... I have a little truck.

2167
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:19,820
Yay, beep beep.

2168
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:21,280
Beep beep.

2169
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,240
Oh my god, it clipped in the chair!

2170
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:26,880
I think you're gonna die first.

2171
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:30,540
But I will never die.

2172
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,480
Look at how tiny the hitbox is.

2173
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:35,180
Holy shit, you have so... wait, how do you, like, scroll through more?

2174
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:36,600
Oh, there's more pages!

2175
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,160
Yeah, I got the classic.

2176
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:39,120
I have way too many pages.

2177
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:40,700
Oh my god, I got the classic.

2178
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:43,020
Oh, wait, I have the new run too.

2179
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:45,640
Guilty as sweet.

2180
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:46,520
Okay, not that.

2181
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,940
What is that?

2182
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:51,380
That's an attack on Titan emote.

2183
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:52,660
It's the AoT one.

2184
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:56,960
Wait, what's the other one?

2185
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:59,220
What's that?

2186
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:01,500
It looks so terrifying, it's a silly bird.

2187
01:15:01,820 --> 01:15:02,680
Oh my god.

2188
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:05,080
Oh my god.

2189
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,120
These all look so crazy.

2190
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:07,060
Can you have Futurama?

2191
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:09,220
What the fuck is that?

2192
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:11,200
What is that?

2193
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:14,520
I think it's, uh, DC?

2194
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:15,760
It's a DC collab.

2195
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:18,620
Oh, it's from one of the DC comics.

2196
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:19,680
Yeah, yeah.

2197
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:21,000
Okay.

2198
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:22,580
I have Dead Space.

2199
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:23,720
What the fuck?

2200
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:25,360
What is up?

2201
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:28,120
And the classic Fortnite.

2202
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:29,920
Yo, the classic one, we gotta do the classic.

2203
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:31,780
Wait, where do I have that one?

2204
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:36,900
Oh, hey, Gumi!

2205
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:39,060
Yeah, I just love Fortnite emotes.

2206
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:40,460
Oh, wait, I have this.

2207
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:41,440
Wait, no, I have this.

2208
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:43,040
Wait, where the fuck did I get this?

2209
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:44,400
Oh, Black Adam, that's what it is.

2210
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:47,180
Is that Kung Fu Panda?

2211
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,020
Is that Kung Fu Panda?

2212
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:51,560
Oh my god, I get to look at Kung Fu Panda.

2213
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:52,940
I think it's supposed to be, um...

2214
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:55,900
There's like a Master Sifu skin or something.

2215
01:15:57,860 --> 01:15:58,280
Nuh-uh.

2216
01:15:58,860 --> 01:15:59,020
Nuh-uh.

2217
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:02,920
They have so many things in this game.

2218
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,560
That's why I'm like, I can't get this game serious.

2219
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:09,260
Wait, did we get it?

2220
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:10,340
Did we get it?

2221
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:11,460
Did we get missed?

2222
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:12,600
Did we get missed?

2223
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:14,740
Uh...

2224
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:17,480
Wait...

2225
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:18,920
Oh, no, no, we're good, we're good, we're good.

2226
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:27,300
I couldn't help it.

2227
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:28,860
I couldn't help it.

2228
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:30,040
Cool emotes!

2229
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:31,220
Look at these!

2230
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:32,680
Oh, we just made it!

2231
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:34,240
We just made it!

2232
01:16:34,420 --> 01:16:36,120
We just made it!

2233
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:39,660
They're like, we're missing one duo.

2234
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:41,680
We're missing one duo.

2235
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,080
Who could it be?

2236
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:44,660
Who could it be?

2237
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:45,860
Not me!

2238
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:48,420
Emo with you, emo with you.

2239
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:50,780
Yeah!

2240
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:55,920
Yeah, join us!

2241
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,200
Why is this going?

2242
01:16:58,860 --> 01:16:59,380
No!

2243
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:05,210
It's not even Christmas, lady!

2244
01:17:07,650 --> 01:17:10,070
Okay, tell me when to drop.

2245
01:17:10,390 --> 01:17:12,010
Alright, alright, uh...

2246
01:17:12,010 --> 01:17:12,790
We're...

2247
01:17:13,970 --> 01:17:15,250
good about...

2248
01:17:15,990 --> 01:17:16,630
now.

2249
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:21,510
Alright, guys, I increased the game volume more.

2250
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:24,910
I hope the volume's better now.

2251
01:17:28,450 --> 01:17:30,250
We're so locked in, guys.

2252
01:17:30,370 --> 01:17:31,070
We're locked in.

2253
01:17:32,050 --> 01:17:33,850
No one even knows how locked in we are.

2254
01:17:33,910 --> 01:17:35,550
Yeah, we're so locked in.

2255
01:17:37,330 --> 01:17:37,810
Yay!

2256
01:17:38,810 --> 01:17:43,730
This is the skin that will make us be like, we haven't been last yet, guys!

2257
01:17:43,870 --> 01:17:45,130
We're so locked in!

2258
01:17:45,670 --> 01:17:47,830
There's another team that is losing before us.

2259
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:50,050
Yeah, exactly, and it's not us.

2260
01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:54,370
Oh, I got a shotgun?

2261
01:17:54,590 --> 01:17:55,410
Alright, we good?

2262
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:55,870
We good?

2263
01:17:57,450 --> 01:17:57,930
Nice.

2264
01:17:57,930 --> 01:17:59,870
I'm drinking some...

2265
01:17:59,870 --> 01:18:00,490
I'm about to be done?

2266
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:01,510
Looting me?

2267
01:18:01,690 --> 01:18:02,630
Drinking some stuff.

2268
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:06,230
Oh, the chest has space now!

2269
01:18:06,570 --> 01:18:07,110
That's cool.

2270
01:18:07,170 --> 01:18:08,330
There's a llama over here!

2271
01:18:08,490 --> 01:18:09,970
Oh, it's so risky for me to go for that.

2272
01:18:10,110 --> 01:18:10,870
Okay, I'm gonna go to you.

2273
01:18:11,310 --> 01:18:12,710
Oh, I got the same thing.

2274
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:14,810
Wait, J3?

2275
01:18:14,970 --> 01:18:16,270
We're doing better than J3?

2276
01:18:16,370 --> 01:18:18,690
That's right, that's what you get for having two Overwatch players.

2277
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:21,210
Oh, is that an Overwatch player?

2278
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:22,870
Yeah, they're both Overwatch players.

2279
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:24,230
Oh, I did not know that.

2280
01:18:24,230 --> 01:18:25,550
That team is literally an Overwatch team.

2281
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:26,810
That's what you get.

2282
01:18:26,930 --> 01:18:28,130
Do we get counted as Apex players?

2283
01:18:28,410 --> 01:18:29,010
I don't know.

2284
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:31,430
I don't know what they count me as.

2285
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:34,150
They count me as the person from YouTube that they're bringing over.

2286
01:18:37,030 --> 01:18:38,430
I'm just the trusty sidekick.

2287
01:18:39,210 --> 01:18:40,410
The V2 werewolf.

2288
01:18:41,030 --> 01:18:41,530
The chicken.

2289
01:18:41,790 --> 01:18:43,330
You're the Fortnite bodyguard.

2290
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:45,690
To make sure I don't die first.

2291
01:18:47,210 --> 01:18:51,370
You gotta make sure you're not last, that's it.

2292
01:18:52,150 --> 01:18:53,790
I'm the exchange student, yeah.

2293
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:55,090
I'm the exchange student.

2294
01:18:55,650 --> 01:18:56,390
What is this?

2295
01:18:56,510 --> 01:18:57,090
What gun is this?

2296
01:18:57,810 --> 01:19:00,210
Oh, it's an infantry rifle.

2297
01:19:00,590 --> 01:19:01,170
Which is...

2298
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:03,490
actually really, really good.

2299
01:19:03,590 --> 01:19:04,510
I have one, too.

2300
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:07,310
And then you can splash us one more time.

2301
01:19:08,130 --> 01:19:08,530
Yay!

2302
01:19:09,330 --> 01:19:10,490
We're good, we're good.

2303
01:19:11,690 --> 01:19:15,330
Now that we're kind of on zone, we can watch out for this team.

2304
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:17,990
Or we can just keep rotating north.

2305
01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:18,730
We can go over here.

2306
01:19:20,010 --> 01:19:20,690
It's your pick.

2307
01:19:21,010 --> 01:19:22,230
I know what I'm doing.

2308
01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:23,450
Let's rotate right now.

2309
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:26,250
Okay.

2310
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:27,490
I'm gonna go down on the...

2311
01:19:29,450 --> 01:19:32,210
It's kind of a scary rotate because we kind of have to go out in the open.

2312
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:32,870
Yeah.

2313
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:35,190
It is pretty scary.

2314
01:19:35,550 --> 01:19:37,170
Do you have any protection at all?

2315
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:38,210
Before we get pushed?

2316
01:19:38,530 --> 01:19:40,690
I have the shockwave grenade.

2317
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:42,090
Oh, you have the shockwave.

2318
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:43,030
You saw how it works, right?

2319
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:45,310
Okay, I'm gonna give you my shockwave grenades.

2320
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:46,550
No, you don't want them?

2321
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:50,930
I don't think I can do the things they were doing.

2322
01:19:52,930 --> 01:19:55,290
Okay, we can literally chill inside here.

2323
01:19:55,610 --> 01:19:58,410
Or we can keep on moving towards...

2324
01:19:58,410 --> 01:19:59,230
Or we can keep on moving towards...

2325
01:19:59,230 --> 01:20:00,250
Wait, can we...

2326
01:20:00,650 --> 01:20:01,210
Let's see.

2327
01:20:02,990 --> 01:20:03,750
Oh my god.

2328
01:20:03,810 --> 01:20:05,050
We can't go into the bathroom?

2329
01:20:07,570 --> 01:20:09,550
We can't hide in the bathroom?

2330
01:20:10,270 --> 01:20:10,470
We can't hide in the bathroom?

2331
01:20:10,650 --> 01:20:13,570
What we could do is we could chill here and wait.

2332
01:20:13,670 --> 01:20:13,790
What we could do is we could chill here and wait.

2333
01:20:13,870 --> 01:20:15,270
So we're gonna have to keep on rotating.

2334
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:16,210
We can keep going this way.

2335
01:20:16,610 --> 01:20:17,730
So I'm gonna go outside.

2336
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:18,950
Keep on following me.

2337
01:20:18,950 --> 01:20:19,650
I'm following.

2338
01:20:20,350 --> 01:20:20,710
Okay.

2339
01:20:23,190 --> 01:20:24,590
Did anyone die yet, guys?

2340
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:26,170
Nobody's dead yet?

2341
01:20:26,470 --> 01:20:27,250
One team has died.

2342
01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:27,730
One team died.

2343
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:30,270
We're not dead last time.

2344
01:20:30,890 --> 01:20:31,410
That's great.

2345
01:20:31,590 --> 01:20:32,670
That's what I like to hear.

2346
01:20:33,130 --> 01:20:33,430
Oh my god.

2347
01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:35,290
The Overwatch player is dying.

2348
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:36,210
Yeah!

2349
01:20:37,210 --> 01:20:37,750
Oh my god.

2350
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:38,050
That's great.

2351
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:39,050
It's great to know.

2352
01:20:39,290 --> 01:20:40,630
We can hide here in the bush.

2353
01:20:41,390 --> 01:20:42,110
Oh my god.

2354
01:20:42,130 --> 01:20:43,150
We can be Bushmen too.

2355
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:45,870
Wait, they probably know.

2356
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:46,950
I'm gonna move to the left.

2357
01:20:48,570 --> 01:20:48,930
Oh my god.

2358
01:20:48,930 --> 01:20:48,930
We can be Bushmen too.

2359
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:50,530
Can I get an angle?

2360
01:20:50,650 --> 01:20:51,210
Yeah, they're on rooftop.

2361
01:20:51,530 --> 01:20:52,050
They know.

2362
01:20:55,610 --> 01:20:56,950
They are at...

2363
01:20:57,290 --> 01:20:57,610
Looping?

2364
01:20:57,950 --> 01:20:58,270
Okay.

2365
01:20:58,390 --> 01:20:59,310
Are they looking at us?

2366
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:02,050
They know that we're here.

2367
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:02,430
They're rotating.

2368
01:21:02,990 --> 01:21:03,310
Okay.

2369
01:21:04,550 --> 01:21:05,110
Oh my god.

2370
01:21:05,150 --> 01:21:05,830
I can see the...

2371
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:07,290
Almost cracked one.

2372
01:21:07,730 --> 01:21:08,190
Oh my god.

2373
01:21:08,210 --> 01:21:09,030
They're planting trees again!

2374
01:21:09,670 --> 01:21:10,250
Let's go left.

2375
01:21:10,330 --> 01:21:10,630
Let's go left.

2376
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:11,750
How do I keep getting the trees?

2377
01:21:13,610 --> 01:21:15,210
I'm gonna get you on the side.

2378
01:21:15,350 --> 01:21:15,850
I'm good though.

2379
01:21:16,050 --> 01:21:16,790
Oh, I'm not.

2380
01:21:16,930 --> 01:21:18,010
I'm gonna do this.

2381
01:21:18,010 --> 01:21:18,370
I'm doing this.

2382
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:20,510
I'm not good.

2383
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:21,350
We're good.

2384
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:21,570
We're good.

2385
01:21:21,570 --> 01:21:21,790
We're good.

2386
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:21,950
We're good.

2387
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:22,710
We can go inside here.

2388
01:21:22,990 --> 01:21:23,550
Oh, nice.

2389
01:21:23,630 --> 01:21:23,750
Nice.

2390
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:23,950
Nice.

2391
01:21:23,950 --> 01:21:24,710
Yeah, just watch yourself.

2392
01:21:25,730 --> 01:21:26,490
And then...

2393
01:21:26,490 --> 01:21:27,170
Let's see.

2394
01:21:27,210 --> 01:21:29,250
Let me actually get an angle to try and shoot them.

2395
01:21:30,370 --> 01:21:31,470
They're still on the rooftop.

2396
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:32,130
Okay.

2397
01:21:32,570 --> 01:21:34,710
We can keep moving to the next house over.

2398
01:21:35,370 --> 01:21:36,970
So, let's go outside here.

2399
01:21:37,230 --> 01:21:38,450
And I'm gonna start rotating.

2400
01:21:41,410 --> 01:21:43,730
We are safe for now.

2401
01:21:43,870 --> 01:21:43,970
Oh my god.

2402
01:21:43,970 --> 01:21:44,250
Inside.

2403
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:45,150
These minis here are huge.

2404
01:21:46,230 --> 01:21:47,570
I feel safer inside.

2405
01:21:49,330 --> 01:21:50,210
I feel safer inside.

2406
01:21:50,230 --> 01:21:52,490
I think we can move over to the next house.

2407
01:21:53,270 --> 01:21:53,830
I think we can move over to the next house.

2408
01:21:54,370 --> 01:21:55,650
I'm going to...

2409
01:21:57,370 --> 01:21:58,570
Should I break the wall?

2410
01:21:58,890 --> 01:22:00,750
Okay, we're gonna go out the back door like we did the last house.

2411
01:22:01,150 --> 01:22:01,550
Okay.

2412
01:22:01,770 --> 01:22:02,530
Let's go now.

2413
01:22:02,590 --> 01:22:03,710
Thank you, Fortnite bodyguard.

2414
01:22:04,650 --> 01:22:07,150
You're welcome, other Fortnite bodyguard.

2415
01:22:08,230 --> 01:22:08,250
You're welcome, other Fortnite bodyguard.

2416
01:22:09,130 --> 01:22:10,030
Alright, we're chillin'.

2417
01:22:10,030 --> 01:22:10,610
We're chillin' here.

2418
01:22:10,630 --> 01:22:10,930
We're good.

2419
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:13,310
Protect me, Fortnite bodyguard.

2420
01:22:13,850 --> 01:22:16,650
Alright, we get to just hang out here until the next...

2421
01:22:16,650 --> 01:22:17,430
Oh, they're in the bush.

2422
01:22:17,990 --> 01:22:19,050
Oh, they're bush people.

2423
01:22:19,610 --> 01:22:22,890
How can you be a bush person if you're not Mr. Beast?

2424
01:22:23,350 --> 01:22:23,830
How can you be a bush person if you're not Mr. Beast?

2425
01:22:23,830 --> 01:22:24,470
I know, right?

2426
01:22:24,530 --> 01:22:25,410
These guys are.

2427
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:26,570
How could you?

2428
01:22:27,570 --> 01:22:28,450
Oh, wait.

2429
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:28,870
Okay.

2430
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:30,510
I don't know if there's anyone below us.

2431
01:22:30,910 --> 01:22:31,550
Oh, wait.

2432
01:22:31,550 --> 01:22:31,550
Okay.

2433
01:22:31,550 --> 01:22:31,550
I don't know if there's anyone below us.

2434
01:22:31,550 --> 01:22:31,890
There's footsteps.

2435
01:22:32,130 --> 01:22:32,990
I'm gonna actually just move around.

2436
01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:33,770
I'm gonna make noise.

2437
01:22:35,150 --> 01:22:36,550
They're on the other house.

2438
01:22:36,730 --> 01:22:37,370
Get away!

2439
01:22:37,490 --> 01:22:38,290
This is our house!

2440
01:22:38,290 --> 01:22:40,790
They could shoot you in the back.

2441
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:41,210
Okay.

2442
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:42,870
But they're...

2443
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:46,370
I hear you.

2444
01:22:46,510 --> 01:22:47,270
Yeah, I hear them.

2445
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:48,630
I think they might want to fight.

2446
01:22:49,190 --> 01:22:50,150
Yeah, I hear them.

2447
01:22:50,150 --> 01:22:51,170
See them on the rooftop.

2448
01:22:51,590 --> 01:22:52,190
I'm below.

2449
01:22:54,230 --> 01:22:56,290
They should get shot on the top.

2450
01:22:58,590 --> 01:22:59,530
What are you doing?

2451
01:22:59,550 --> 01:23:00,930
I have my shotgun too!

2452
01:23:02,330 --> 01:23:05,210
Okay, so you know how the shockwaves work, kind of.

2453
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:05,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2454
01:23:06,730 --> 01:23:10,690
If they can't push you guys, don't feel bad to shockwave yourself.

2455
01:23:11,430 --> 01:23:11,830
Carelessly.

2456
01:23:12,330 --> 01:23:12,730
Okay.

2457
01:23:13,430 --> 01:23:15,950
If you shockwave me into the storm, that's okay.

2458
01:23:16,010 --> 01:23:17,850
Because I can shockwave myself another direction.

2459
01:23:18,130 --> 01:23:18,350
Okay.

2460
01:23:18,670 --> 01:23:21,890
So, just play selfishly if they end up trying to push us.

2461
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:23,990
They're waiting for an opportunity to jump us.

2462
01:23:24,150 --> 01:23:26,130
So, I'm just watching around.

2463
01:23:26,650 --> 01:23:27,570
Yeah, that's right.

2464
01:23:27,610 --> 01:23:28,590
I have my bodyguard here.

2465
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:30,630
It's a fucking dog.

2466
01:23:31,150 --> 01:23:31,890
I could break their rooftop?

2467
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:32,390
Okay.

2468
01:23:32,970 --> 01:23:33,670
Oh, wait.

2469
01:23:33,710 --> 01:23:34,150
They got shot at.

2470
01:23:34,730 --> 01:23:35,250
Are they?

2471
01:23:35,690 --> 01:23:36,190
Wait, no.

2472
01:23:36,210 --> 01:23:36,510
They fell.

2473
01:23:36,570 --> 01:23:36,790
They fell.

2474
01:23:36,870 --> 01:23:37,350
Wait, are they...

2475
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:38,670
They might be rotating.

2476
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:43,900
I think they're rotating.

2477
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:44,520
Yeah, they're rotating.

2478
01:23:44,660 --> 01:23:44,800
We're good.

2479
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:46,540
Okay, so...

2480
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:48,680
We're gonna have to rotate...

2481
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:50,080
Let me see what's available.

2482
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:51,860
I think... Is that in?

2483
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:56,700
Alright, so we're gonna go out the back again.

2484
01:23:57,160 --> 01:24:00,340
And we're gonna... Okay, I want you to slide run onto...

2485
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:02,820
Oh, team on our side.

2486
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:03,300
On the right side.

2487
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:03,540
I see them.

2488
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:03,820
I see them.

2489
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:05,460
Almost cracked them.

2490
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,720
Almost cracked the other two.

2491
01:24:09,020 --> 01:24:11,480
We're gonna shockwave to the other house over here.

2492
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:12,000
Okay.

2493
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:13,120
So, just...

2494
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:13,920
Get away from me.

2495
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:14,340
Get away from me.

2496
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:14,720
Get away from me.

2497
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:15,940
And then I'm gonna shockwave.

2498
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:16,960
I'm going now.

2499
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:19,260
And then I'm going to...

2500
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:19,900
Launch pad.

2501
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:21,060
And go this way.

2502
01:24:22,460 --> 01:24:23,140
I'm looking for you.

2503
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:23,520
I'm looking for you.

2504
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:24,960
You're good!

2505
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:26,160
You're good, Toki.

2506
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:26,840
I'm looking for you.

2507
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:27,240
I'm looking for you.

2508
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:27,680
I'm over here.

2509
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:28,480
I'm over here.

2510
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:30,000
You're good.

2511
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:31,160
Yo, you're good!

2512
01:24:31,340 --> 01:24:31,720
I did it!

2513
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:33,380
Yo, we're good!

2514
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:33,740
We're so good!

2515
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:34,300
Okay, we're in next zone.

2516
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:34,840
We're in next zone.

2517
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:36,600
We're chillin'.

2518
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:37,180
We're chillin'.

2519
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:37,220
Oh my god!

2520
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:42,070
We're doing it!

2521
01:24:42,630 --> 01:24:43,770
We're doing that movement!

2522
01:24:44,730 --> 01:24:46,410
There's a Gibby bubble right here as well.

2523
01:24:46,590 --> 01:24:47,110
Okay, yeah, yeah.

2524
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:47,690
I can take it.

2525
01:24:48,090 --> 01:24:49,430
Oh, we're also in next zone, too.

2526
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:50,070
We're in next zone, too.

2527
01:24:50,110 --> 01:24:50,470
We're chillin'.

2528
01:24:50,470 --> 01:24:50,870
Oh, thank god.

2529
01:24:50,910 --> 01:24:51,650
Oh, thank god.

2530
01:24:51,710 --> 01:24:53,270
I'm gonna be hiding in the bunker.

2531
01:24:55,610 --> 01:24:56,690
The fallout's coming.

2532
01:24:56,810 --> 01:24:57,870
I'm gonna hide in the bunker.

2533
01:24:58,290 --> 01:25:01,950
I think we forced that team to rotate onto another team.

2534
01:25:02,110 --> 01:25:02,850
So, we're good.

2535
01:25:02,950 --> 01:25:03,590
We're good for now.

2536
01:25:04,030 --> 01:25:05,250
Okay, I'll stay here.

2537
01:25:05,730 --> 01:25:07,910
I think... I'm gonna get onto...

2538
01:25:09,430 --> 01:25:13,470
Someone kill the Overwatch squad already, so at least I can be better than the Overwatch people.

2539
01:25:16,190 --> 01:25:17,370
That's all I want.

2540
01:25:18,170 --> 01:25:18,670
That's all I want.

2541
01:25:19,790 --> 01:25:23,450
I cracked one in Storm, but they're eating a lot of damage over here, so...

2542
01:25:23,450 --> 01:25:25,570
I'm gonna keep pressure on them.

2543
01:25:25,730 --> 01:25:27,210
I think I'm actually okay up here.

2544
01:25:27,710 --> 01:25:28,410
I'm worried.

2545
01:25:29,010 --> 01:25:30,190
We have this whole house.

2546
01:25:32,790 --> 01:25:34,530
I'm so scared of peeking, though.

2547
01:25:35,150 --> 01:25:35,530
I'm so scared of peeking, though.

2548
01:25:35,530 --> 01:25:36,390
Yeah, no, you can chill inside.

2549
01:25:36,530 --> 01:25:38,850
Okay, I'm looking into... I'm looking here.

2550
01:25:39,590 --> 01:25:40,590
Are you still in zone?

2551
01:25:41,030 --> 01:25:41,910
Yeah, we're still in zone.

2552
01:25:42,110 --> 01:25:43,070
There's gonna be one over here.

2553
01:25:43,770 --> 01:25:43,970
They're shooting.

2554
01:25:44,170 --> 01:25:45,170
Are they still in zone?

2555
01:25:45,690 --> 01:25:47,270
Yeah, they're still, like, out of the...

2556
01:25:47,270 --> 01:25:48,210
in the blue right now.

2557
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:53,030
I think they rotated to the water side.

2558
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:55,250
Are you getting shot at?

2559
01:25:55,410 --> 01:25:56,230
No, do you hear that?

2560
01:25:56,810 --> 01:25:57,850
That was an RPG.

2561
01:25:59,030 --> 01:25:59,510
Oh, what?

2562
01:25:59,610 --> 01:26:00,630
They're shooting RPGs at us.

2563
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:03,850
It was like...

2564
01:26:04,730 --> 01:26:06,210
I was like, what the fuck was that?

2565
01:26:07,230 --> 01:26:08,650
Okay, I think this guy went over here?

2566
01:26:11,150 --> 01:26:12,970
Oh, thank God the Overwatch duo is dead.

2567
01:26:13,350 --> 01:26:14,550
We're vibing right now.

2568
01:26:15,230 --> 01:26:16,730
We're not vibing as much anymore.

2569
01:26:16,790 --> 01:26:17,170
We are not.

2570
01:26:17,190 --> 01:26:17,910
That is so far.

2571
01:26:18,150 --> 01:26:21,250
We have the beast that we can play on.

2572
01:26:22,150 --> 01:26:23,150
What the fuck?

2573
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:24,030
Let's see.

2574
01:26:24,230 --> 01:26:25,870
What can we actually play here?

2575
01:26:26,090 --> 01:26:28,750
I'm gonna kinda look out for a spot that we can get to.

2576
01:26:31,030 --> 01:26:31,770
Is that in?

2577
01:26:31,970 --> 01:26:33,070
Oh, that is very in.

2578
01:26:33,150 --> 01:26:35,910
Okay, we can get to that rock there, I think.

2579
01:26:37,170 --> 01:26:38,630
We can get to that rock there, I think.

2580
01:26:38,630 --> 01:26:41,910
I have another shock if you want one.

2581
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:42,890
I have another shock if you want one.

2582
01:26:42,890 --> 01:26:43,310
How many do you have?

2583
01:26:43,370 --> 01:26:44,730
Oh, you do?

2584
01:26:45,790 --> 01:26:47,730
No, keep it for yourself because I have launch pads.

2585
01:26:50,050 --> 01:26:52,210
We're gonna go with the zone very very last second.

2586
01:26:52,810 --> 01:26:53,470
We're gonna go with the zone very very last second.

2587
01:26:53,470 --> 01:26:54,590
You know how the crash pads work?

2588
01:26:54,810 --> 01:26:55,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2589
01:26:55,630 --> 01:26:56,830
Okay, just slide crouch onto it.

2590
01:26:56,870 --> 01:26:57,730
I'm gonna burn some right now.

2591
01:26:57,930 --> 01:26:59,930
Okay, we're gonna try to get to my blue thing.

2592
01:26:59,970 --> 01:27:00,370
Let me go now.

2593
01:27:01,410 --> 01:27:02,190
We're gonna go here.

2594
01:27:03,330 --> 01:27:04,750
I'm gonna chill here for a sec.

2595
01:27:05,730 --> 01:27:06,630
Oh, what's in here?

2596
01:27:06,730 --> 01:27:07,030
What's in here?

2597
01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:08,990
Did I get shot?

2598
01:27:09,270 --> 01:27:09,870
Okay, no.

2599
01:27:10,330 --> 01:27:11,270
No, we're good, we're good, we're good.

2600
01:27:12,630 --> 01:27:14,010
We're gonna do a slow rotate.

2601
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:14,630
Okay.

2602
01:27:15,270 --> 01:27:16,710
We're gonna be little babies.

2603
01:27:16,910 --> 01:27:18,710
Is that team on the port-a-pot?

2604
01:27:19,010 --> 01:27:20,170
Port-a-bunker right there?

2605
01:27:20,470 --> 01:27:20,830
Oh!

2606
01:27:21,590 --> 01:27:23,070
No, no, no!

2607
01:27:24,050 --> 01:27:24,990
You're good, you're good, you're good.

2608
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:27,690
I don't feel good.

2609
01:27:27,970 --> 01:27:29,210
I might be dead.

2610
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:30,810
I don't feel good.

2611
01:27:30,890 --> 01:27:31,970
They're like in the ocean.

2612
01:27:32,050 --> 01:27:33,010
I was so confused.

2613
01:27:33,110 --> 01:27:33,970
They're over there, they're over there.

2614
01:27:34,690 --> 01:27:35,790
Wait, can I reboot?

2615
01:27:35,790 --> 01:27:36,970
Oh, I might be dead.

2616
01:27:37,730 --> 01:27:38,950
No, don't die!

2617
01:27:39,010 --> 01:27:39,310
I can reboot!

2618
01:27:39,790 --> 01:27:40,270
No!

2619
01:27:42,110 --> 01:27:44,050
I might have been able to res you.

2620
01:27:44,390 --> 01:27:45,090
Oh, you're still alive?

2621
01:27:45,790 --> 01:27:47,050
No, I died, I died, I died.

2622
01:27:47,290 --> 01:27:47,570
No!

2623
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:50,870
No!

2624
01:27:51,610 --> 01:27:53,270
I was so confused.

2625
01:27:53,330 --> 01:27:54,410
I was like, what was that?

2626
01:27:54,450 --> 01:27:55,270
What's shooting me?

2627
01:27:55,750 --> 01:27:56,750
We're like in the...

2628
01:27:56,750 --> 01:27:58,630
He's hiding in the fucking bush!

2629
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:04,550
What expects them to be in the water?

2630
01:28:04,770 --> 01:28:05,250
What expects them to be in the water?

2631
01:28:05,790 --> 01:28:07,890
Yup, Fortnite moment, Fortnite moment.

2632
01:28:08,730 --> 01:28:09,170
No!

2633
01:28:09,410 --> 01:28:11,090
It's okay, we did better.

2634
01:28:11,290 --> 01:28:12,250
Yeah, we did better.

2635
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:13,710
We did not die in dead last.

2636
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:14,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2637
01:28:14,710 --> 01:28:16,470
We were 15?

2638
01:28:16,830 --> 01:28:19,010
Yeah, and we didn't die to the condom people.

2639
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:22,970
I died to the condom on height, but you didn't die to the...

2640
01:28:22,970 --> 01:28:24,690
I died to the water people.

2641
01:28:25,030 --> 01:28:27,050
At least one of us is better, I guess.

2642
01:28:29,290 --> 01:28:30,910
No, I died to a condom.

2643
01:28:30,910 --> 01:28:32,970
You died to a condom person.

2644
01:28:35,630 --> 01:28:37,130
I can't believe it.

2645
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:38,690
I can't believe it.

2646
01:28:38,890 --> 01:28:40,950
What the fuck, what the fuck is going on here?

2647
01:28:40,950 --> 01:28:42,530
We actually did really, really good there, though.

2648
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:44,170
Like, look, we got our synergy down.

2649
01:28:44,250 --> 01:28:47,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're getting better and better, getting better placements.

2650
01:28:47,490 --> 01:28:47,830
Yeah.

2651
01:28:48,170 --> 01:28:55,230
Yeah, from, we got 15th, 16th, and like, we don't talk about the other one, but 15th and 16th.

2652
01:28:55,510 --> 01:28:56,450
That's pretty good.

2653
01:28:56,810 --> 01:28:57,790
That's really good.

2654
01:28:57,930 --> 01:28:58,970
That's really, really good.

2655
01:28:59,090 --> 01:28:59,850
I'm proud of us.

2656
01:29:01,330 --> 01:29:04,230
Against all these other Fortnite people, and our gamers, that's pretty.

2657
01:29:04,550 --> 01:29:06,290
And no matter what, we win money.

2658
01:29:06,410 --> 01:29:09,210
So like, no matter how well we...

2659
01:29:09,210 --> 01:29:12,850
No matter how well we do, everybody wins money.

2660
01:29:13,730 --> 01:29:14,770
Holy shit.

2661
01:29:15,930 --> 01:29:17,170
Oh my god.

2662
01:29:17,350 --> 01:29:19,210
How many bunkers is this one?

2663
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:21,690
Is the entire loot just bunkers?

2664
01:29:22,810 --> 01:29:26,630
Okay, so like, I've been playing Reloaded with a bunch of friends lately.

2665
01:29:26,890 --> 01:29:27,090
Yeah.

2666
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:30,690
And my biggest complaint is literally the fact that bunkers exist.

2667
01:29:31,030 --> 01:29:33,390
Because it turns into this, but in like, casual too.

2668
01:29:33,590 --> 01:29:36,610
But like, it feels like they have like 20 houses.

2669
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:38,030
I know, right?

2670
01:29:38,710 --> 01:29:39,010
Yeah.

2671
01:29:39,630 --> 01:29:43,630
When you play quads, it's literally like fortresses that you're going against.

2672
01:29:44,710 --> 01:29:46,770
Like, how many houses can you carry?

2673
01:29:47,530 --> 01:29:50,330
Um, it's uh, four per stack.

2674
01:29:50,730 --> 01:29:52,370
You can carry four houses?

2675
01:29:52,750 --> 01:29:53,890
Yeah, you can carry four of them.

2676
01:29:53,890 --> 01:29:55,650
And this guy must have like eight or some shit.

2677
01:29:56,250 --> 01:29:58,130
There's no fucking way.

2678
01:29:58,730 --> 01:30:03,030
I literally I literally saw him build like four different houses.

2679
01:30:03,170 --> 01:30:04,690
And he still had houses.

2680
01:30:04,730 --> 01:30:06,330
He still has bunkers!

2681
01:30:07,610 --> 01:30:10,170
He still has another bunker?

2682
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:16,190
This guy doesn't realize that he's gonna break his bush.

2683
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:18,350
He broke his bush!

2684
01:30:18,690 --> 01:30:18,850
No!

2685
01:30:19,190 --> 01:30:21,750
How does he still have a house?

2686
01:30:25,150 --> 01:30:29,210
No, your reactions are filling me with life, because that is... What?

2687
01:30:29,550 --> 01:30:33,610
All of my reactions when I first started playing Fortnite, and it still is the same.

2688
01:30:33,790 --> 01:30:37,470
What the fuck is like the real estate market in Fortnite?

2689
01:30:38,090 --> 01:30:38,890
How many...

2690
01:30:38,890 --> 01:30:40,370
They're gonna burst a bubble?

2691
01:30:40,750 --> 01:30:42,330
How many houses does he have?

2692
01:30:43,270 --> 01:30:44,690
Wait, wait, which guy are you watching?

2693
01:30:44,830 --> 01:30:47,530
I'm watching this like, JF guy.

2694
01:30:47,670 --> 01:30:48,070
I don't know.

2695
01:30:48,250 --> 01:30:50,090
He's either JF or the Anonymous.

2696
01:30:51,490 --> 01:30:56,650
Oh, I'm expecting Anonymous 264, because this guy has like fucking Anonymous mode on.

2697
01:30:57,790 --> 01:31:01,470
But his team is like JF or something on Twitch.

2698
01:31:01,690 --> 01:31:01,970
Oh, JF!

2699
01:31:01,990 --> 01:31:03,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2700
01:31:03,070 --> 01:31:05,570
Yeah, his teammate has like 200,000 houses.

2701
01:31:05,590 --> 01:31:06,590
Every time...

2702
01:31:06,590 --> 01:31:08,970
Every fucking time he gets like...

2703
01:31:08,970 --> 01:31:12,430
He wants to like advance or run away, he has a fucking house.

2704
01:31:12,730 --> 01:31:13,490
Oh, here we go.

2705
01:31:13,490 --> 01:31:14,570
Yeah, I'm watching JF right now.

2706
01:31:14,590 --> 01:31:17,050
You see all those houses around you?

2707
01:31:17,110 --> 01:31:18,710
He built all those houses.

2708
01:31:19,070 --> 01:31:20,090
He built this.

2709
01:31:20,150 --> 01:31:21,290
Maybe he's MrBeast.

2710
01:31:21,650 --> 01:31:22,850
Might actually be him.

2711
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:23,690
Oh my god.

2712
01:31:23,890 --> 01:31:26,050
He's the MrBeast that builds houses!

2713
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:29,230
Last game was the MrBeast that could plant trees.

2714
01:31:29,410 --> 01:31:30,970
This one fucking builds houses.

2715
01:31:34,410 --> 01:31:34,850
Oh?

2716
01:31:35,050 --> 01:31:35,730
Oh my god.

2717
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:36,870
That's the RPG I heard.

2718
01:31:37,030 --> 01:31:38,370
Yeah, that was the RPG I heard.

2719
01:31:38,990 --> 01:31:40,370
Oh, it's the Christmas chicks.

2720
01:31:40,590 --> 01:31:41,630
Or the Christmas hats.

2721
01:31:42,790 --> 01:31:43,570
Oh my god.

2722
01:31:43,670 --> 01:31:44,810
Bro, does he have another house?

2723
01:31:44,910 --> 01:31:45,490
I swear to god.

2724
01:31:45,570 --> 01:31:51,990
If he throws another fucking house down, I swear... Okay, this is why us FPSers cannot main Fortnite.

2725
01:31:52,630 --> 01:31:53,470
I swear to god.

2726
01:31:53,470 --> 01:31:56,010
The meta is literally you turn into a house.

2727
01:31:56,090 --> 01:31:56,750
That's the meta.

2728
01:31:57,110 --> 01:31:59,410
I swear to fucking god.

2729
01:31:59,710 --> 01:32:02,610
I swear it's so easy to plant houses too.

2730
01:32:02,890 --> 01:32:04,350
Oh my god, please someone kill him!

2731
01:32:04,490 --> 01:32:05,090
Oh, thank god.

2732
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:07,090
He was ruining the economy.

2733
01:32:07,590 --> 01:32:08,070
Yes.

2734
01:32:08,890 --> 01:32:10,610
Oh my god, they're fully dead.

2735
01:32:10,710 --> 01:32:11,190
Thank god.

2736
01:32:11,650 --> 01:32:11,670
They died.

2737
01:32:11,890 --> 01:32:12,230
They died.

2738
01:32:12,250 --> 01:32:15,170
His teammate had a house that he was about to throw.

2739
01:32:15,350 --> 01:32:16,230
I saw him.

2740
01:32:16,270 --> 01:32:18,150
I saw him hold the fucking portal bunker.

2741
01:32:19,070 --> 01:32:20,030
I saw him.

2742
01:32:20,590 --> 01:32:22,250
He was like, I'm ready for it.

2743
01:32:22,290 --> 01:32:23,110
I'm going to grow a house again.

2744
01:32:23,470 --> 01:32:25,050
He had a bunker in his fucking head.

2745
01:32:25,270 --> 01:32:26,870
I'm not watching condom men.

2746
01:32:27,030 --> 01:32:29,650
I'm going to watch somebody else.

2747
01:32:29,930 --> 01:32:30,590
Wait, wait.

2748
01:32:30,590 --> 01:32:32,590
There's Christmas people in the house right now.

2749
01:32:32,610 --> 01:32:32,690
Yeah, yeah.

2750
01:32:32,710 --> 01:32:34,010
I'm watching the Christmas people.

2751
01:32:34,170 --> 01:32:34,970
Jesus Christ.

2752
01:32:34,990 --> 01:32:36,470
They're getting their house destroyed.

2753
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:40,290
Oh my god.

2754
01:32:41,230 --> 01:32:41,930
It's okay.

2755
01:32:42,030 --> 01:32:42,470
They're fine.

2756
01:32:42,630 --> 01:32:44,910
They also built their own house.

2757
01:32:45,210 --> 01:32:46,290
Oh my god.

2758
01:32:46,330 --> 01:32:47,510
They built two houses.

2759
01:32:48,110 --> 01:32:48,610
Aww.

2760
01:32:49,050 --> 01:32:51,050
They built a duplex.

2761
01:32:52,390 --> 01:32:53,310
Yo, that's cute.

2762
01:32:53,470 --> 01:32:54,550
Oh my god.

2763
01:32:54,990 --> 01:32:57,250
The housing market is going crazy.

2764
01:32:57,610 --> 01:32:58,590
That's four houses.

2765
01:32:58,710 --> 01:33:00,150
That's four fucking portal bunkers.

2766
01:33:00,330 --> 01:33:01,650
He has a big one right there.

2767
01:33:01,750 --> 01:33:02,410
That's five.

2768
01:33:02,770 --> 01:33:03,890
Does he have another one?

2769
01:33:03,950 --> 01:33:05,710
No one can complain about not having a house anymore.

2770
01:33:05,910 --> 01:33:06,270
That's six.

2771
01:33:06,290 --> 01:33:06,910
Oh, there's seven.

2772
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:08,510
Oh, and he goes down.

2773
01:33:08,530 --> 01:33:08,950
That's seven.

2774
01:33:09,070 --> 01:33:09,630
Don't worry.

2775
01:33:09,710 --> 01:33:10,710
Throw another one down.

2776
01:33:11,070 --> 01:33:11,490
Eight.

2777
01:33:13,390 --> 01:33:13,910
Nine.

2778
01:33:14,570 --> 01:33:19,950
This one team threw nine houses in 30 seconds.

2779
01:33:20,010 --> 01:33:20,890
I swear.

2780
01:33:21,090 --> 01:33:23,450
And he had another one.

2781
01:33:23,470 --> 01:33:24,290
I want a little ride.

2782
01:33:24,710 --> 01:33:26,570
Yo, you are my inner monologue.

2783
01:33:26,710 --> 01:33:28,590
I fucking love you so much.

2784
01:33:28,650 --> 01:33:31,490
He had ten houses in his hand.

2785
01:33:32,010 --> 01:33:36,530
He was gonna build ten houses in 30 seconds.

2786
01:33:36,670 --> 01:33:39,750
He built it for one.

2787
01:33:41,150 --> 01:33:46,050
In 30 seconds.

2788
01:33:46,470 --> 01:33:47,730
Oh my god.

2789
01:33:47,730 --> 01:33:49,470
Oh, you can hold four.

2790
01:33:49,710 --> 01:33:53,630
This man's entire inventory was literally just portal bunkers.

2791
01:33:53,770 --> 01:33:55,030
He had nothing else.

2792
01:33:55,350 --> 01:33:56,630
Oh my god.

2793
01:33:57,670 --> 01:33:59,230
Alright, these are the new comms.

2794
01:33:59,230 --> 01:34:01,070
I'm literally using Doki comms from now on.

2795
01:34:01,130 --> 01:34:04,250
I am not using any more of the comms that I've acquired throughout my time playing.

2796
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:06,370
Did this guy even have guns?

2797
01:34:06,910 --> 01:34:09,330
I'm just gonna call it growing a house.

2798
01:34:09,630 --> 01:34:10,710
There's no way.

2799
01:34:10,810 --> 01:34:17,770
I think that guy I was watching had literally one gun and that's and the other four spots were portal bunkers.

2800
01:34:18,170 --> 01:34:19,890
Oh, the condom gibby bubbled.

2801
01:34:20,790 --> 01:34:22,670
He's doing a temporary house.

2802
01:34:23,050 --> 01:34:24,850
One stick of gun.

2803
01:34:26,630 --> 01:34:28,710
Okay, we built this city.

2804
01:34:28,790 --> 01:34:29,710
Oh, they're making boobs.

2805
01:34:30,370 --> 01:34:31,690
Have you ever seen...

2806
01:34:34,110 --> 01:34:35,630
They made boobs.

2807
01:34:35,790 --> 01:34:37,030
They saw it.

2808
01:34:37,110 --> 01:34:38,030
Look what they're doing again.

2809
01:34:39,410 --> 01:34:40,770
Oh, they're making houses again.

2810
01:34:40,930 --> 01:34:41,330
Yeah, yeah.

2811
01:34:41,590 --> 01:34:43,110
It's boobs and houses now.

2812
01:34:43,190 --> 01:34:43,750
That's the meta.

2813
01:34:46,650 --> 01:34:48,590
Oh, he blew the condom away.

2814
01:34:48,730 --> 01:34:49,350
Oh, shit.

2815
01:34:49,630 --> 01:34:51,110
That was actually a really good play.

2816
01:34:51,110 --> 01:34:51,410
He recycled them.

2817
01:34:51,530 --> 01:34:51,930
Yeah.

2818
01:34:52,290 --> 01:34:52,770
Yeah.

2819
01:34:53,770 --> 01:34:54,450
Oh, wait.

2820
01:34:54,570 --> 01:34:54,810
Wait.

2821
01:34:55,090 --> 01:34:56,530
Oh, he's gonna go house on me.

2822
01:34:56,630 --> 01:34:57,010
Oh, no.

2823
01:34:57,110 --> 01:34:57,610
He blew out.

2824
01:34:57,790 --> 01:34:58,830
Oh, that's so smart.

2825
01:34:59,050 --> 01:34:59,490
Oh, shit.

2826
01:35:00,550 --> 01:35:02,090
How many fucking... What?

2827
01:35:02,570 --> 01:35:03,650
Oh, his teammate's dead.

2828
01:35:04,370 --> 01:35:06,010
His teammate got too cocky.

2829
01:35:06,710 --> 01:35:07,430
Oh, my God.

2830
01:35:07,450 --> 01:35:08,550
You guys don't have to try this hard.

2831
01:35:08,610 --> 01:35:09,650
You're gonna be in day two anyway.

2832
01:35:10,570 --> 01:35:12,310
Oh, the condoms are dead.

2833
01:35:12,970 --> 01:35:14,190
No, it's a 1v1.

2834
01:35:14,230 --> 01:35:14,710
It's a 1v1.

2835
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:15,110
He's dead.

2836
01:35:15,650 --> 01:35:16,050
Oh.

2837
01:35:16,130 --> 01:35:16,830
It's a 1v1.

2838
01:35:16,850 --> 01:35:17,990
Another condom.

2839
01:35:18,070 --> 01:35:18,330
Yeah.

2840
01:35:20,970 --> 01:35:22,190
Three games... Wait, what?

2841
01:35:22,270 --> 01:35:22,710
There's more?

2842
01:35:23,010 --> 01:35:24,590
Oh, I thought there was another team.

2843
01:35:25,290 --> 01:35:29,170
Chad's like, uh, do we need to show Doki the portal fortress?

2844
01:35:29,910 --> 01:35:33,070
Wait, when did... Oh, the Christmas... There's another Christmas team.

2845
01:35:33,790 --> 01:35:34,330
Wait, what?

2846
01:35:34,570 --> 01:35:35,050
Oh, my God.

2847
01:35:35,070 --> 01:35:35,490
There is more.

2848
01:35:35,490 --> 01:35:35,530
There was another team.

2849
01:35:36,350 --> 01:35:36,830
Oh, yeah.

2850
01:35:36,870 --> 01:35:36,970
Look.

2851
01:35:37,130 --> 01:35:38,890
There's, like, a white one and a red one.

2852
01:35:39,050 --> 01:35:39,550
Yeah, it's 1v2.

2853
01:35:39,550 --> 01:35:39,670
Oh, no.

2854
01:35:39,710 --> 01:35:40,210
Blue one, I mean.

2855
01:35:40,270 --> 01:35:41,250
It's 1v2 now.

2856
01:35:42,150 --> 01:35:44,130
Where the fuck did these guys third party?

2857
01:35:44,310 --> 01:35:45,990
I was like, where did these guys come from?

2858
01:35:46,910 --> 01:35:47,270
Oh?

2859
01:35:47,650 --> 01:35:48,230
Wait, what?

2860
01:35:48,330 --> 01:35:49,050
Where's the other team?

2861
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:50,490
Are they just healing?

2862
01:35:51,530 --> 01:35:52,890
Is he just healing in the storm?

2863
01:35:54,590 --> 01:35:55,210
Oh, my God.

2864
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:59,770
I like how it's still like a build mode heal off.

2865
01:35:59,830 --> 01:36:00,110
Oh, no.

2866
01:36:00,170 --> 01:36:02,070
He's yeah, he couldn't heal from that.

2867
01:36:02,430 --> 01:36:03,430
He's dead dead.

2868
01:36:04,430 --> 01:36:05,090
They won.

2869
01:36:05,310 --> 01:36:05,990
Oh, thank God.

2870
01:36:06,150 --> 01:36:07,510
I'm glad it's not.

2871
01:36:08,270 --> 01:36:12,090
Doki, the people's winner or the people's choice won.

2872
01:36:12,390 --> 01:36:13,810
We didn't have condoms win.

2873
01:36:14,150 --> 01:36:14,890
Oh, my God.

2874
01:36:14,910 --> 01:36:15,370
Thank God.

2875
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:18,530
Two of the four games were not from the condoms.

2876
01:36:18,630 --> 01:36:19,410
That's all that matters.

2877
01:36:19,630 --> 01:36:21,270
The games were not completely cursed.

2878
01:36:21,370 --> 01:36:22,090
They were not cursed.

2879
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:23,450
Yeah, yeah.

2880
01:36:23,450 --> 01:36:24,570
They were slightly, slightly cursed.

2881
01:36:24,590 --> 01:36:25,450
Yeah, yeah.

2882
01:36:25,610 --> 01:36:27,750
Wait, this is two out of three.

2883
01:36:28,010 --> 01:36:28,530
That's great.

2884
01:36:28,610 --> 01:36:32,310
That means, like, they tried so hard to be sweaty, but only one condom team won.

2885
01:36:32,950 --> 01:36:33,750
That's all I wanted.

2886
01:36:34,050 --> 01:36:36,070
Game number four?

2887
01:36:36,450 --> 01:36:36,910
Game four.

2888
01:36:37,010 --> 01:36:37,510
Yeah, yeah.

2889
01:36:37,630 --> 01:36:39,570
Are we going to do Mr. Beast or Dragon Ball Z?

2890
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:42,910
Um, I'm down for Dragon Ball again.

2891
01:36:43,130 --> 01:36:44,510
Or do you want to do... No, let's switch it off.

2892
01:36:44,510 --> 01:36:45,430
Let's do Mr. Beast and...

2893
01:36:46,750 --> 01:36:48,190
Who did I say was going to be Capulet?

2894
01:36:48,310 --> 01:36:50,190
We're going to be Tree because we're going to play Tree.

2895
01:36:50,470 --> 01:36:50,490
Oh, yeah, Tree.

2896
01:36:50,510 --> 01:36:51,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2897
01:36:51,690 --> 01:36:52,270
Okay.

2898
01:36:52,570 --> 01:36:53,630
All right, let's see.

2899
01:36:54,090 --> 01:36:56,070
And I'll have Mom's spaghetti on my backpack.

2900
01:36:57,850 --> 01:36:59,850
Wait, no, I should have, like, golf.

2901
01:37:00,510 --> 01:37:01,470
Because he's Mr. Beast.

2902
01:37:01,690 --> 01:37:02,730
I bet he loves golfing.

2903
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:07,720
Oh, my God, but he could be the people's champion.

2904
01:37:08,220 --> 01:37:09,440
I'm going to be the Tree!

2905
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:12,820
Wait, what is the Tree's name?

2906
01:37:13,180 --> 01:37:13,540
Christmas?

2907
01:37:14,220 --> 01:37:14,580
No?

2908
01:37:16,420 --> 01:37:16,780
Uh...

2909
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:19,120
I know I have them here.

2910
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:20,720
I could also be a big, giant corn.

2911
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:27,240
Oh, I could have... Wait, I'm going to put... I'm going to put a piece of delivery in my backpack.

2912
01:37:27,700 --> 01:37:28,640
Oh, I love that one.

2913
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:29,680
Maybe Mr. Beast delivering pizza.

2914
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:32,800
I have an Amogus.

2915
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
But I could also put a...

2916
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,460
Actually, what would Mr. Beast put on the Christmas tree?

2917
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:40,940
What would he put on the Christmas tree?

2918
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:41,940
Do you have money?

2919
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:43,700
Uh...

2920
01:37:44,340 --> 01:37:45,660
I might have money.

2921
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:47,640
I think I have a money bag.

2922
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:52,800
If you have money, we could put money in the back.

2923
01:37:53,060 --> 01:37:54,220
It would make sense!

2924
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:57,060
We could use pom poms, too.

2925
01:37:57,580 --> 01:37:58,040
That's right.

2926
01:37:58,180 --> 01:37:58,840
Okay, a briefcase.

2927
01:37:58,920 --> 01:37:59,860
I think I have a briefcase.

2928
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:02,200
A briefcase full of money.

2929
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:02,640
Let's go.

2930
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:04,880
We could be planting some trees.

2931
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:05,500
Let's go.

2932
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:11,000
Uh... I think that one might be okay.

2933
01:38:13,020 --> 01:38:15,440
Oh, is there one with money that's pouring out of it, chat?

2934
01:38:22,360 --> 01:38:23,200
Okay, that one's fine.

2935
01:38:23,380 --> 01:38:23,620
Okay.

2936
01:38:23,660 --> 01:38:24,240
We're using that.

2937
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:24,720
We're using that.

2938
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:26,540
And then...

2939
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:28,540
Oh, what are you using for your pickaxe?

2940
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:29,560
Oh, my pickaxe?

2941
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:30,520
I'm using pom poms.

2942
01:38:31,140 --> 01:38:32,340
Oh, I have the pom poms, too!

2943
01:38:32,540 --> 01:38:32,580
Oh!

2944
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:33,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

2945
01:38:33,460 --> 01:38:34,380
Let's go find pom poms!

2946
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:35,800
Alright, pom poms.

2947
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:38,000
Mr. Beast is going to cheer us on.

2948
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:38,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2949
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:40,560
We're going to plant some trees, guys.

2950
01:38:41,260 --> 01:38:43,480
Today, we're going to be planting 100,000 trees.

2951
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:51,140
Alright, what glider do I use?

2952
01:38:51,380 --> 01:38:52,880
I guess I'll just use...

2953
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:53,080
Oh, no.

2954
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:53,860
I have a money bag one.

2955
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:54,120
I forgot.

2956
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:56,640
It's actually money, like, flowing in the sky.

2957
01:38:57,060 --> 01:38:57,720
Oh, my God!

2958
01:38:57,720 --> 01:38:58,240
That's so good!

2959
01:38:58,340 --> 01:38:58,500
Wait!

2960
01:38:58,560 --> 01:38:59,060
That's perfect!

2961
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:00,700
Yeah, do you have that one, too?

2962
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:01,700
No, I don't.

2963
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:03,120
But that's perfect.

2964
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:06,100
Uh, I'll do...

2965
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:06,980
the bananas?

2966
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:07,700
Wait, I have bling!

2967
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:09,020
Wait, is that bling?

2968
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:11,660
No, are these rockets?

2969
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:12,180
What is it?

2970
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:13,120
Skyscratch.

2971
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:14,780
What is that?

2972
01:39:15,020 --> 01:39:15,380
Skyscratch.

2973
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:17,080
What the fuck is that?

2974
01:39:18,020 --> 01:39:19,940
Okay, I'll still use... Ooh, diamond!

2975
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:22,120
Wait, when did you start playing the game?

2976
01:39:22,220 --> 01:39:24,260
I feel like we have a lot of the same Battle Pass stuff.

2977
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:25,240
I have no idea.

2978
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:26,760
I, like, play it on and off.

2979
01:39:26,980 --> 01:39:27,420
Like...

2980
01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:29,660
That was me this season.

2981
01:39:29,700 --> 01:39:32,340
When the season first started, I was like, oh, okay.

2982
01:39:32,460 --> 01:39:34,320
I'm definitely online in this car game.

2983
01:39:34,460 --> 01:39:36,640
40 streamers in the same Fortnite game.

2984
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:40,600
Too real!

2985
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:41,940
Too real!

2986
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:46,500
Wait, maybe if they have, like, do they have any money-related trails?

2987
01:39:48,220 --> 01:39:49,280
I have a staircase.

2988
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:50,980
Ooh, go, Mr. Peace!

2989
01:39:50,980 --> 01:39:51,820
I can make it in the sky.

2990
01:39:51,820 --> 01:39:52,140
Mr. Peace, go!

2991
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:56,060
Go support the trees, Mr. Peace!

2992
01:39:56,540 --> 01:39:57,860
And cure the blind!

2993
01:39:58,040 --> 01:39:58,900
You got this!

2994
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:00,600
I'm gonna buy this, actually.

2995
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:01,720
Like, oh, yeah, I'll do that.

2996
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:02,300
I'll do that.

2997
01:40:03,340 --> 01:40:05,480
The money bag item is called, uh, Goldilocks.

2998
01:40:06,100 --> 01:40:06,540
Goldilocks.

2999
01:40:08,100 --> 01:40:08,540
Goldilocks.

3000
01:40:09,780 --> 01:40:11,100
No, I don't have it.

3001
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:13,340
I bought a really good emote.

3002
01:40:18,180 --> 01:40:18,620
Awesome.

3003
01:40:18,620 --> 01:40:18,860
Awesome.

3004
01:40:20,420 --> 01:40:30,480
Guys, if you guys wanna support me so I can buy more more cosmetics in the future, use DokiBird and support a creator.

3005
01:40:31,220 --> 01:40:32,280
And then you keep that.

3006
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:33,820
Use code DokiBird.

3007
01:40:33,860 --> 01:40:37,000
Use code DokiBird so we can buy more pretty cosmetics.

3008
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:40,880
Alright, this is, I bought a new dance emote.

3009
01:40:40,940 --> 01:40:41,220
You wanna see?

3010
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:42,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, do it, do it, do it.

3011
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:43,280
Okay, okay, okay.

3012
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:45,500
Let's see, where is it?

3013
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:47,580
Oh my god, where did I buy it?

3014
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:48,480
I don't wanna- Did you just get it?

3015
01:40:48,620 --> 01:40:49,180
In the shop right now?

3016
01:40:49,300 --> 01:40:50,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I just got it.

3017
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:52,140
I wanna see if I can find it from, like, regular scrolling.

3018
01:40:54,180 --> 01:40:55,020
Is it glitter?

3019
01:40:55,180 --> 01:40:55,360
No!

3020
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:57,380
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, I bought glitter.

3021
01:40:57,940 --> 01:40:59,020
Oh, I love that one!

3022
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:00,220
Wait, did you just buy it?

3023
01:41:00,680 --> 01:41:02,460
No, I have that one in, uh, my inventory right now.

3024
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:02,940
Okay, wait, wait.

3025
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:04,140
I just gotta find it.

3026
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:05,220
Yeah, I need to find glitter.

3027
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:07,980
Wait, it's called glitter.

3028
01:41:07,980 --> 01:41:08,860
Alright, there it is.

3029
01:41:09,740 --> 01:41:10,600
Oh, Mr. Peace.

3030
01:41:10,780 --> 01:41:11,100
Okay.

3031
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:13,560
Where is it?

3032
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:18,500
Where's my main, main inventory for emotes?

3033
01:41:18,620 --> 01:41:19,100
Oh, there it is.

3034
01:41:20,350 --> 01:41:21,660
Go, Mr. Peace, go!

3035
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:23,520
Plant those trees!

3036
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:28,880
Show the world that you can be the next president of America!

3037
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:31,000
You see this tree here?

3038
01:41:31,100 --> 01:41:31,920
I planted that!

3039
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:33,380
I gave him life!

3040
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:33,800
You see that?

3041
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:35,020
I planted that tree!

3042
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:36,460
I'm Mr. Peace!

3043
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:41,900
Save the world!

3044
01:41:47,140 --> 01:41:49,100
Every day we get closer and closer.

3045
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:53,500
And also, lock a hundred people into a supermarket battle royale style!

3046
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:55,360
That's what they want!

3047
01:41:58,780 --> 01:42:00,520
We cured the blind!

3048
01:42:03,860 --> 01:42:05,960
I planted houses in Fortnite!

3049
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:06,900
Yeah!

3050
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:11,760
Oh, we got the new code.

3051
01:42:11,780 --> 01:42:12,160
Report?

3052
01:42:12,340 --> 01:42:13,040
Don't worry!

3053
01:42:13,240 --> 01:42:15,020
Let me throw money at you!

3054
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:20,940
But first, you gotta do this grueling ten hour obstacle course if you wanna want that money, though!

3055
01:42:21,580 --> 01:42:23,440
And then I'm gonna give you V-Bucks!

3056
01:42:23,700 --> 01:42:29,420
And then you're gonna buy things in the video game using code Mr. Peace, and then I'm gonna cure you!

3057
01:42:29,700 --> 01:42:30,080
Oh yeah!

3058
01:42:34,460 --> 01:42:35,080
Alright, cool.

3059
01:42:35,100 --> 01:42:35,740
I'll get ready up.

3060
01:42:35,780 --> 01:42:37,840
Alright, I'll get ready up for real this time.

3061
01:42:40,140 --> 01:42:41,900
Wait, I'm gonna run the bathroom real quick.

3062
01:42:42,020 --> 01:42:44,000
I will BRB, cause I've been needing to pee.

3063
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:44,560
Alright.

3064
01:42:45,060 --> 01:42:47,360
Maybe, like, after you pee, you'll get better, too.

3065
01:42:47,940 --> 01:42:49,560
I feel like that's gonna happen.

3066
01:42:49,740 --> 01:42:52,420
I'm gonna, like, exhaust all of my all my bad skills.

3067
01:42:52,580 --> 01:42:53,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3068
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:55,260
The moment you pee, you'll become a better player.

3069
01:42:55,980 --> 01:42:56,700
It's happening.

3070
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:57,600
Alright, BRB!

3071
01:42:58,360 --> 01:42:58,980
BRB chat!

3072
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:00,300
Alright, see you later!

3073
01:43:01,220 --> 01:43:02,720
Guys, you guys think we're gonna do better?

3074
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:06,780
Guys, every game we're getting a little bit better, you know?

3075
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:09,500
As long as we're better than the Overwatch people, that's all that matters.

3076
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:10,040
to me.

3077
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:11,080
As long...

3078
01:43:14,180 --> 01:43:16,380
We're better than the Overwatch team.

3079
01:43:16,540 --> 01:43:17,440
That's all that matters.

3080
01:43:19,820 --> 01:43:22,480
And also, yeah, we can only go up from here.

3081
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:27,200
And I bet you, we are the team that's having the most fun!

3082
01:43:30,900 --> 01:43:37,120
I bet you, nobody else is having just as much fun as we are, because that's all we have.

3083
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:37,860
That's...

3084
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:43,180
Like, we know our place in this tournament!

3085
01:43:43,620 --> 01:43:46,340
As long as we're having fun!

3086
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:48,600
That's all that matters.

3087
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:53,880
True.

3088
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:58,360
If we don't have fun, what else can we do?

3089
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:01,600
What else do we have?

3090
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:03,680
We have six matches.

3091
01:44:03,700 --> 01:44:04,260
This is four.

3092
01:44:04,420 --> 01:44:05,540
So we have three more games.

3093
01:44:06,260 --> 01:44:06,700
Uh...

3094
01:44:06,700 --> 01:44:07,680
Where's the aimbot?

3095
01:44:07,740 --> 01:44:12,840
Guys, you know damn well that I'm not pulling up the aimbot iPhone.

3096
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:18,380
I think I shot my gun like one time.

3097
01:44:21,660 --> 01:44:24,580
We've only shot our gun one time.

3098
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:26,140
I know my place.

3099
01:44:26,380 --> 01:44:28,140
I know my place.

3100
01:44:29,580 --> 01:44:35,360
I'm just here to spend money on Fortnite and do silly dances.

3101
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:37,920
That's what you need.

3102
01:44:38,860 --> 01:44:39,900
I'm here to dance!

3103
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:40,440
Yes!

3104
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:41,340
I landed one!

3105
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:43,380
The one shot I landed?

3106
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:45,660
The one shot...

3107
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:48,300
The one shot I landed?

3108
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:50,220
Um... It hit.

3109
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:51,740
That's all that mattered.

3110
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:54,100
That's right.

3111
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:56,640
Flex it, Mr. Beast.

3112
01:44:57,320 --> 01:44:58,100
Flex it!

3113
01:44:59,080 --> 01:45:02,020
Yeah, why shoot gun when everybody builds a fucking house?

3114
01:45:02,260 --> 01:45:04,900
We're out here trying to find houses to live in.

3115
01:45:05,060 --> 01:45:06,640
Everybody else is just building houses.

3116
01:45:06,640 --> 01:45:08,760
How do they find all those portabunkers?

3117
01:45:08,780 --> 01:45:10,480
That's what I'm confused about.

3118
01:45:10,780 --> 01:45:16,620
How does one drop spot have two hundred fucking portabunkers?

3119
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:17,960
I don't understand.

3120
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:22,840
When will I have my Fortnite skin?

3121
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:24,280
Guys.

3122
01:45:24,720 --> 01:45:35,380
Guys, would you like want me to have... would you guys would you guys like spend at least a hundred thousand dollars on Fortnite if I have my skin on there?

3123
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:41,600
Maybe...

3124
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:42,380
Maybe...

3125
01:45:42,380 --> 01:45:43,560
Maybe that's how what it takes.

3126
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:45,120
No.

3127
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:47,680
Guys, this is exactly why I don't have a Fortnite skin.

3128
01:45:47,820 --> 01:45:48,580
I need commitment.

3129
01:45:52,060 --> 01:45:54,200
I need commitment here.

3130
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:57,340
I mean maybe.

3131
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:01,020
Guys, I need some commitment here.

3132
01:46:01,140 --> 01:46:02,800
I need to have a Fortnite skin.

3133
01:46:03,740 --> 01:46:06,380
Dude, I don't even give... Do they even... Okay.

3134
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:09,040
How many like Fortnite players have they given skins to?

3135
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:09,780
Okay.

3136
01:46:09,820 --> 01:46:13,080
Fortnite skins of Fortnite player.

3137
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:13,920
Other than Ninja.

3138
01:46:14,940 --> 01:46:16,000
Other than Ninja.

3139
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:20,280
Is there like actual like Fortnite skins for actual like Fortnite... Okay.

3140
01:46:20,300 --> 01:46:22,820
Not like I'm saying like Ninja isn't a Fortnite player.

3141
01:46:23,100 --> 01:46:24,020
Quite a lot?

3142
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:24,640
Wait.

3143
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:25,140
Really?

3144
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:27,040
Wait.

3145
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:28,000
Really?

3146
01:46:30,180 --> 01:46:30,740
Okay.

3147
01:46:30,860 --> 01:46:31,300
I'm looking.

3148
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:32,320
Okay.

3149
01:46:32,380 --> 01:46:32,860
They have Ninja.

3150
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:36,640
They have Travis Scott.

3151
01:46:36,860 --> 01:46:37,180
They have Travis Scott.

3152
01:46:37,180 --> 01:46:38,000
I forgot about that.

3153
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:39,620
All the time?

3154
01:46:39,860 --> 01:46:40,700
Oh, you're right!

3155
01:46:40,780 --> 01:46:42,120
I see Loserfruit there!

3156
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:43,680
Wait, you're right!

3157
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:47,640
Guys, I need you guys to spend a hundred thousand...

3158
01:46:52,120 --> 01:46:55,320
I'm gonna shoot Fortnite an email and be like...

3159
01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:56,540
I mean if like...

3160
01:46:56,540 --> 01:46:57,240
What's his name?

3161
01:46:57,380 --> 01:46:57,740
The...

3162
01:46:59,360 --> 01:46:59,920
Lame?

3163
01:47:00,380 --> 01:47:00,940
Lame?

3164
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:02,400
What's his name?

3165
01:47:02,860 --> 01:47:04,080
Like a guy that shrugs!

3166
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:06,400
If he gets a Fortnite skin!

3167
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:09,540
Oh, cause he has 81 million followers on Instagram.

3168
01:47:09,880 --> 01:47:11,500
That makes a lot more sense now.

3169
01:47:15,640 --> 01:47:18,680
Guys, that guy, this guy, who you're like...

3170
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:20,720
He has 81 million followers.

3171
01:47:21,380 --> 01:47:24,040
He has a video with Will Smith?

3172
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:30,600
Cause I don't have...

3173
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:30,960
Okay, I'm back!

3174
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:32,700
Welcome back, Dory!

3175
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:34,520
Wait, wait, what are we talking about?

3176
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:35,080
I heard Will Smith.

3177
01:47:35,720 --> 01:47:38,460
Let's talk about that YouTube skin you have.

3178
01:47:38,740 --> 01:47:39,780
The... what's his name?

3179
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:41,020
Oh, Cappy Lame?

3180
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:42,300
Yeah, Cappy Lame.

3181
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:43,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3182
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,540
I was like, if he can have a Fortnite skin, I should have one.

3183
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:49,120
But then I looked him up and he has 81 million followers on Instagram.

3184
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:49,800
Oh my, what?

3185
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:52,420
And I was like, oh, okay, that...

3186
01:47:53,900 --> 01:47:55,780
I was just like, oh!

3187
01:47:56,840 --> 01:47:58,420
That's why he has a... That is insane!

3188
01:47:58,500 --> 01:47:59,040
That's why!

3189
01:47:59,040 --> 01:47:59,400
That's why!

3190
01:48:00,180 --> 01:48:03,300
I had no idea he had that much, like...

3191
01:48:03,300 --> 01:48:04,740
I didn't either!

3192
01:48:04,900 --> 01:48:05,380
That's crazy!

3193
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:06,700
That's so cool!

3194
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:08,440
People in my chat was like, who is that guy?

3195
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:09,500
I was like, this guy did a...

3196
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:12,580
This guy did a fucking video with Will Smith!

3197
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:13,840
Like...

3198
01:48:15,180 --> 01:48:16,300
Where's my Will?

3199
01:48:16,460 --> 01:48:18,380
And they're like, where's your Will Smith collab?

3200
01:48:18,740 --> 01:48:19,620
I don't fucking know!

3201
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:22,100
Yeah, wait, when are you collabing with Will Smith?

3202
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,900
Will Smith answered my DMs!

3203
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:25,880
Hahahaha!

3204
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:26,300
Hahahaha!

3205
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:33,700
That's gonna be such a wild collab if you ever play with him or Caby Lane.

3206
01:48:33,980 --> 01:48:35,660
You even think Caby Lane plays Fortnite?

3207
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:36,780
Does he play Fortnite?

3208
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:38,280
Wait, is that why he got Fortnite skin?

3209
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:41,660
I don't know, I feel like... Do you think Eminem plays Fortnite?

3210
01:48:41,940 --> 01:48:43,820
Cause Eminem also has a skin too in the game.

3211
01:48:43,820 --> 01:48:47,860
Well, Eminem doesn't play Fortnite, he's just like there for, like, his music.

3212
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:50,580
I mean, like, does he think Lady Gaga plays Fortnite?

3213
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:52,740
I think Lady Gaga did play Fortnite.

3214
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:55,320
Wait, Lady Gaga played Fortnite?

3215
01:48:56,720 --> 01:48:57,500
I think?

3216
01:48:57,640 --> 01:48:59,800
Wait, no, she has to have.

3217
01:48:59,940 --> 01:49:00,640
There's no way!

3218
01:49:00,940 --> 01:49:03,360
She has, like, three skins in the game.

3219
01:49:03,560 --> 01:49:04,480
She has three skins?

3220
01:49:04,980 --> 01:49:06,760
Lady Gaga has three!

3221
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:10,780
Why does Lady Gaga need three skins in Fortnite?

3222
01:49:11,780 --> 01:49:15,860
Lady Gaga has, like, I think two variants, and then...

3223
01:49:15,860 --> 01:49:18,860
I think she might have, like, one that you can chain?

3224
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:19,840
Like a different variant?

3225
01:49:19,980 --> 01:49:20,840
There's no way.

3226
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:24,660
Wait, she fucking tweeted out about Fortnite!

3227
01:49:24,860 --> 01:49:30,420
Wait, two years ago, today, Lady Gaga kicked- oh wait, no, that's just somebody's, like, Lady Gaga Fortnite account.

3228
01:49:30,620 --> 01:49:32,400
I was like, oh my god, did Lady Gaga tweet about Fortnite?

3229
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:32,900
But no.

3230
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:35,200
She also has 170 million TikTok followers?

3231
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:36,960
Oh, for Cavity?

3232
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:37,380
Oh, what?

3233
01:49:37,380 --> 01:49:38,020
Yeah, I know about that.

3234
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:40,500
Bro, Brandon Urie plays Fortnite?

3235
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:42,100
He used to be a Twitch streamer.

3236
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:43,280
Dang!

3237
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:45,140
Like, I used- Oh, I made sure to hydrate.

3238
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:47,160
Wait, did we- did I already up?

3239
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:47,820
I did, okay.

3240
01:49:48,140 --> 01:49:49,000
Hey, we good, we good.

3241
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:50,240
Okay, Fortnite skin.

3242
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:53,500
Does Brandon Urie have- Brandon Urie doesn't even have Fortnite skin!

3243
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:57,240
If anybody deserves a Fortnite skin, it's Brandon Urie.

3244
01:49:58,860 --> 01:50:00,040
Wait, who's Brandon Urie?

3245
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:06,560
Brandon Urie, he did the- he did, like, the uh, uh, he's Panic at the Disco.

3246
01:50:07,260 --> 01:50:08,160
Oh, wait, what?

3247
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:08,740
Yeah!

3248
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:09,280
Oh shit!

3249
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:11,220
Yeah, he streams Fortnite!

3250
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:13,080
I've seen him stream Fortnite!

3251
01:50:14,300 --> 01:50:14,800
Dang.

3252
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:15,860
I don't know if he still streams it.

3253
01:50:15,860 --> 01:50:21,000
See, there's, like, some singers who actually have, like, time in the game.

3254
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:21,740
Yeah!

3255
01:50:21,740 --> 01:50:23,480
I know that, um, oh, who was it?

3256
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:26,680
There's, like, another singer recently who was, like, doing a lot of clips.

3257
01:50:27,660 --> 01:50:31,080
Because she streamed, uh, after Lady Gaga's skin came out.

3258
01:50:31,340 --> 01:50:31,580
Oh!

3259
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:34,120
That's interesting.

3260
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:34,940
Wait, where do we at?

3261
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:36,060
Let's get it, Donkey!

3262
01:50:36,540 --> 01:50:37,680
Let's fucking go!

3263
01:50:38,840 --> 01:50:40,880
We're gonna survive extra long again.

3264
01:50:41,240 --> 01:50:42,300
Okay, that's good.

3265
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:44,180
Wait, did you rotate it really fucking good last game?

3266
01:50:44,180 --> 01:50:47,080
Yeah, we did really good rotate- when will we get middle of the zone?

3267
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:47,760
This is not good.

3268
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:48,420
Have we dropped now?

3269
01:50:49,020 --> 01:50:49,880
I know, right?

3270
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:53,000
Wait, I don't think it is possible for us to get middle of the zone because we're at the side.

3271
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:54,480
Where will we get, like- Oh, I can pull!

3272
01:50:54,640 --> 01:50:55,680
I can pull over here for sure.

3273
01:50:55,940 --> 01:50:57,740
Oh, yeah, where's our pull?

3274
01:50:58,020 --> 01:51:00,040
I wanna live in this house right here.

3275
01:51:00,940 --> 01:51:02,420
Are you being nice and cozy in there?

3276
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:02,800
Yeah.

3277
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:05,400
There's so many gliders?

3278
01:51:05,700 --> 01:51:06,080
Oh, that's you.

3279
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:07,180
I wanna plant a tree.

3280
01:51:07,420 --> 01:51:08,740
We haven't got a single tree.

3281
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:16,040
Oh, I will call the trees and we're gonna- I mean, like, I'm a walking tree, but planting one just hits death, you know?

3282
01:51:17,460 --> 01:51:17,780
Alright.

3283
01:51:18,180 --> 01:51:19,620
Yeah, tree planting a tree.

3284
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:20,440
That's all we wanted.

3285
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:24,380
Oh, I got the shocking thing.

3286
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:27,940
Let's see.

3287
01:51:28,060 --> 01:51:28,940
Ooh, Pista.

3288
01:51:28,940 --> 01:51:29,620
Please don't shoot me.

3289
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:32,060
Why would they shoot you?

3290
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:34,040
They would never shoot a tree, right?

3291
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:34,700
Yeah.

3292
01:51:35,160 --> 01:51:36,480
Wait, I found a tree!

3293
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:37,920
Found one!

3294
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:38,540
Let's go!

3295
01:51:38,660 --> 01:51:39,080
I got the tree!

3296
01:51:39,780 --> 01:51:40,460
Tree meta!

3297
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:40,920
It's over.

3298
01:51:41,080 --> 01:51:42,080
It's fucking over.

3299
01:51:43,780 --> 01:51:45,000
I can't believe it.

3300
01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:47,120
It's as MrBeast as I found the tree.

3301
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:51,160
That's like- It's like, I found two trees!

3302
01:51:51,820 --> 01:51:54,020
Oh my- It's so fucking over.

3303
01:51:55,020 --> 01:51:56,800
I literally found two trees.

3304
01:51:57,180 --> 01:51:59,220
Your personal walking tree is running up to you right now.

3305
01:51:59,240 --> 01:52:00,160
Oh my god.

3306
01:52:01,140 --> 01:52:02,320
The MrBeast buff.

3307
01:52:02,420 --> 01:52:10,000
I had zero trees going in for the last three games, and then on the fourth game, when I decided to be MrBeast, I find the tree.

3308
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:11,560
It was meant to be.

3309
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:14,220
It's like, MrBeast was meant to be a tree.

3310
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:14,860
It was!

3311
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:17,140
Is this- Oh no, it's a shield bubble.

3312
01:52:17,380 --> 01:52:19,140
Okay, I'm gonna get rid of this then.

3313
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:22,200
See, I have the plunger.

3314
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:23,180
Oh, you have the plunger!

3315
01:52:23,240 --> 01:52:24,080
And I also have the pistol.

3316
01:52:24,680 --> 01:52:25,700
Oh, you got the pistol too?

3317
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:26,860
Oh, huge.

3318
01:52:27,060 --> 01:52:27,900
Oh, open that chest.

3319
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:28,580
It's a blue- Oh!

3320
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:29,700
That's what you need.

3321
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:30,520
It's a pump.

3322
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:32,540
Oh my god, it's a bunker!

3323
01:52:32,860 --> 01:52:33,660
You should have it.

3324
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:34,080
Do you have one?

3325
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:35,500
You don't want the shotgun?

3326
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:36,860
Uh, no.

3327
01:52:36,940 --> 01:52:37,320
No, no, no, no.

3328
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:38,600
I would not be using that.

3329
01:52:38,780 --> 01:52:38,920
What?

3330
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:39,760
What?

3331
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:41,220
Oh, okay.

3332
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:41,560
Alright.

3333
01:52:41,700 --> 01:52:42,800
And then you wanna grow houses?

3334
01:52:43,100 --> 01:52:44,280
You saw the houses work, right?

3335
01:52:44,340 --> 01:52:44,660
Yeah.

3336
01:52:45,160 --> 01:52:45,960
Should I grow houses?

3337
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:46,220
You wanna grow houses?

3338
01:52:46,380 --> 01:52:46,640
Okay.

3339
01:52:46,640 --> 01:52:48,000
You wanna grow trees.

3340
01:52:48,040 --> 01:52:48,520
What do you feel like?

3341
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:49,000
I have shield.

3342
01:52:49,180 --> 01:52:50,780
Okay, shield or...

3343
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:52,720
I'll grow...

3344
01:52:53,720 --> 01:52:54,540
I'll give you the shield.

3345
01:52:54,700 --> 01:52:55,580
I'll grow a house.

3346
01:52:55,720 --> 01:52:58,020
I build a house and I plant trees.

3347
01:52:58,380 --> 01:53:01,180
The houses belong in MrBeast's inventory.

3348
01:53:01,620 --> 01:53:01,680
It's immersive.

3349
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:02,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3350
01:53:02,220 --> 01:53:02,800
It's immersive.

3351
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:05,440
Well, there's more trees here.

3352
01:53:05,460 --> 01:53:05,940
There's more trees here.

3353
01:53:06,580 --> 01:53:08,720
Oh my god, there's all the trees!

3354
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:11,260
Yeah, we got so many trees here.

3355
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:12,320
Oh my god, you know what?

3356
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:13,600
I don't need shockwave grenade.

3357
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:15,460
I'll have- Wait, maybe I do.

3358
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:17,980
Maybe I'm getting a bit too overconfident here.

3359
01:53:18,380 --> 01:53:19,220
No, no, no, no.

3360
01:53:19,340 --> 01:53:20,280
Let the confidence out.

3361
01:53:20,620 --> 01:53:22,420
This is our time to shine.

3362
01:53:22,780 --> 01:53:23,240
You know what?

3363
01:53:23,320 --> 01:53:23,960
I don't need guns.

3364
01:53:24,160 --> 01:53:24,760
I don't need guns.

3365
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:26,700
Wait, we gotta heal you.

3366
01:53:26,700 --> 01:53:27,220
I'm so dumb.

3367
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:28,440
I did not realize I popped a big.

3368
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:30,160
Wait, you don't have any shields.

3369
01:53:30,460 --> 01:53:30,800
It's okay.

3370
01:53:30,940 --> 01:53:32,120
I don't need...

3371
01:53:32,120 --> 01:53:34,400
I don't need a gun.

3372
01:53:34,760 --> 01:53:35,560
I need one gun.

3373
01:53:35,940 --> 01:53:37,160
Are there minis here?

3374
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:40,700
Oh my god.

3375
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:41,640
There's no heals here.

3376
01:53:41,700 --> 01:53:42,920
There's no heals at all.

3377
01:53:44,140 --> 01:53:46,440
I swear I dropped a mini somewhere.

3378
01:53:47,080 --> 01:53:47,720
I don't need heals.

3379
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:48,720
I don't need heals.

3380
01:53:48,720 --> 01:53:51,100
All I need is a tree.

3381
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:52,820
Let's go this way.

3382
01:53:52,900 --> 01:53:56,080
Because I feel like that condom team is gonna do the same thing.

3383
01:53:56,160 --> 01:53:57,100
Try to hold us out.

3384
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,080
Oh, I see a chest up there.

3385
01:54:00,300 --> 01:54:01,360
Hang over there.

3386
01:54:03,140 --> 01:54:03,780
We're good.

3387
01:54:04,940 --> 01:54:06,460
I'm holding the trees.

3388
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:07,360
Just in case.

3389
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:15,760
As somebody that has no armor, I feel like I need to hold these trees out.

3390
01:54:16,580 --> 01:54:19,700
Yeah, if the moment you get shot, just throw the tree down on your feet.

3391
01:54:19,700 --> 01:54:20,320
Yeah, exactly.

3392
01:54:20,640 --> 01:54:21,120
This is why.

3393
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:24,080
Oh, here.

3394
01:54:24,140 --> 01:54:24,960
I got minis.

3395
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:25,620
I'm gonna toss them to you.

3396
01:54:26,140 --> 01:54:27,900
Wait, you can throw items?

3397
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:29,980
Yeah, you can heal over there.

3398
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:31,500
And I'm gonna toss that one.

3399
01:54:31,940 --> 01:54:33,040
Oh my god.

3400
01:54:34,540 --> 01:54:35,700
What the fuck?

3401
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:37,040
Right?

3402
01:54:37,580 --> 01:54:38,800
What the fuck?

3403
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:41,320
You can throw.

3404
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:44,160
Oh, I throw.

3405
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:45,260
I'm a tree.

3406
01:54:46,300 --> 01:54:48,400
Okay, yeah, I know that, but...

3407
01:54:49,900 --> 01:54:50,820
Where do we go?

3408
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:53,460
Alright, we're gonna go this way.

3409
01:54:54,360 --> 01:54:56,340
We're gonna go on top of the hill.

3410
01:54:56,780 --> 01:54:59,640
Ooh, I've never been to the top of this area before.

3411
01:54:59,860 --> 01:54:59,960
Right?

3412
01:55:00,140 --> 01:55:02,180
Because the condoms keep cutting us off.

3413
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:03,260
They know.

3414
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:04,420
They know we're right by...

3415
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:05,440
I'm looking.

3416
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:05,900
I'm looking.

3417
01:55:06,180 --> 01:55:07,060
Tree, tree, tree.

3418
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:07,900
You're good.

3419
01:55:08,260 --> 01:55:08,960
You're good.

3420
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:09,900
Look.

3421
01:55:09,940 --> 01:55:10,980
Oh, we're fucking chillin'.

3422
01:55:10,980 --> 01:55:12,420
We're fucking chillin'.

3423
01:55:12,420 --> 01:55:12,640
Alright.

3424
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:13,600
Drink.

3425
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:14,820
I'm watching.

3426
01:55:15,220 --> 01:55:15,920
I'm drinking.

3427
01:55:17,260 --> 01:55:19,760
This team's gonna force us to eat storm, I think?

3428
01:55:21,060 --> 01:55:22,220
It's okay, we have a tree.

3429
01:55:22,380 --> 01:55:23,700
Doggy, that was such a good reaction.

3430
01:55:23,860 --> 01:55:25,020
Keep doing that if we ever get shot at.

3431
01:55:25,020 --> 01:55:25,020
Oh my god.

3432
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:25,740
Don't worry, I got you.

3433
01:55:26,180 --> 01:55:27,380
I have the tree out.

3434
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:27,800
That was good.

3435
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:29,240
I still have the tree out.

3436
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:31,400
I was watching for the team.

3437
01:55:32,220 --> 01:55:32,760
Okay, oh.

3438
01:55:32,900 --> 01:55:33,580
I see them.

3439
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:35,040
Chillin' there.

3440
01:55:35,120 --> 01:55:35,360
Chillin' there.

3441
01:55:36,120 --> 01:55:37,280
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

3442
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:37,480
We're good.

3443
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:37,900
We're good.

3444
01:55:37,900 --> 01:55:40,040
I don't think I have the meds for this.

3445
01:55:41,460 --> 01:55:42,100
Oh, they're fighting?

3446
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:42,980
Wait, are they fighting someone?

3447
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:45,680
Okay.

3448
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:46,740
Follow my lead.

3449
01:55:46,900 --> 01:55:47,520
Stick to me.

3450
01:55:47,580 --> 01:55:48,500
We're gonna go to the left, okay?

3451
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:48,780
Okay.

3452
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:49,040
Ready?

3453
01:55:49,100 --> 01:55:49,740
And let's go now.

3454
01:55:51,160 --> 01:55:53,140
Don't worry, I have another tree if I have to.

3455
01:55:55,980 --> 01:55:59,640
Uh, we can technically eat storm still, but...

3456
01:55:59,980 --> 01:56:01,060
Yeah, let's go this way.

3457
01:56:01,120 --> 01:56:01,480
Let's go this way.

3458
01:56:01,620 --> 01:56:03,580
I'm gonna toss a little crash pad and we're gonna go to the side.

3459
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:06,020
I'm gonna toss another one.

3460
01:56:06,280 --> 01:56:07,080
We're gonna go over here.

3461
01:56:07,900 --> 01:56:08,320
Oh, no.

3462
01:56:08,740 --> 01:56:10,300
And then there's a med kit here.

3463
01:56:10,540 --> 01:56:11,360
Oh, I need that.

3464
01:56:11,380 --> 01:56:12,880
I need that med kit so badly.

3465
01:56:13,140 --> 01:56:14,160
Take the med kit.

3466
01:56:14,420 --> 01:56:15,940
I need that so badly.

3467
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:17,880
Oh, there's also a big pot here, too.

3468
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:19,120
Oh, there's another med kit here.

3469
01:56:19,180 --> 01:56:19,480
We're good.

3470
01:56:21,900 --> 01:56:22,440
I'm okay.

3471
01:56:23,020 --> 01:56:24,020
We are Groot, chat.

3472
01:56:24,060 --> 01:56:24,920
We are literally Groot.

3473
01:56:25,820 --> 01:56:26,400
Oh, no.

3474
01:56:27,340 --> 01:56:28,260
I'll ditch it.

3475
01:56:28,500 --> 01:56:29,780
I'll ditch it for meds.

3476
01:56:31,420 --> 01:56:33,340
I think we're still chillin'.

3477
01:56:33,340 --> 01:56:34,120
We're chillin'.

3478
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:36,660
Alright, and then we can start running up the hill here.

3479
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:36,940
Alright, and then we can start running up the hill here.

3480
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:38,480
Don't worry, my tree...

3481
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:41,200
Oh, I hear gunshots to my left.

3482
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:42,220
Oh, team up here.

3483
01:56:43,400 --> 01:56:44,580
I'm gonna bubble you.

3484
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:45,900
Oh, they poured a bunker.

3485
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:47,700
I'm gonna cut to the left.

3486
01:56:49,260 --> 01:56:51,300
And we're gonna use the bunk or this.

3487
01:56:52,700 --> 01:56:53,380
What the...

3488
01:56:53,380 --> 01:56:53,800
Tree!

3489
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:55,420
No!

3490
01:56:58,240 --> 01:56:58,980
It bugged me.

3491
01:56:59,060 --> 01:56:59,580
Play your life.

3492
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:00,660
Tree!

3493
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:01,620
Tree!

3494
01:57:02,220 --> 01:57:02,560
Tree!

3495
01:57:05,120 --> 01:57:05,960
Nice try.

3496
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:06,940
Nice try.

3497
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:09,480
Nice try.

3498
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:10,300
I can't believe it.

3499
01:57:12,420 --> 01:57:13,220
It's okay.

3500
01:57:13,340 --> 01:57:14,680
I planted enough trees.

3501
01:57:16,220 --> 01:57:19,100
Honestly, I'm really, really proud of how you're playing that.

3502
01:57:19,120 --> 01:57:20,040
You're actually doing really good.

3503
01:57:20,540 --> 01:57:22,760
Unfortunately, I died to a bug, Doki.

3504
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:23,720
Wait, what happened?

3505
01:57:24,340 --> 01:57:27,720
My characters, like, didn't teleport or didn't jump on the pad.

3506
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,580
It, like, glitched me into the ground.

3507
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:32,080
And then I had to run back on it.

3508
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:32,300
And then...

3509
01:57:33,780 --> 01:57:34,180
Yeah...

3510
01:57:34,180 --> 01:57:36,280
I was like, well, GG's me.

3511
01:57:36,620 --> 01:57:39,040
How did they count in the tree strat?

3512
01:57:40,460 --> 01:57:42,100
I should've used my shock grenades.

3513
01:57:42,340 --> 01:57:44,040
I should've used my shock grenades.

3514
01:57:45,020 --> 01:57:47,080
Honestly, I think what we're gonna do...

3515
01:57:47,080 --> 01:57:48,100
We're gonna do what this team's doing.

3516
01:57:48,180 --> 01:57:49,500
You see how they're just living in storm right now?

3517
01:57:49,580 --> 01:57:49,980
Yeah, yeah.

3518
01:57:50,300 --> 01:57:54,820
We can live so long if we just prioritize, like, med kits and stuff.

3519
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:55,580
Wait, really?

3520
01:57:55,580 --> 01:57:56,400
I think we're gonna do that.

3521
01:57:56,440 --> 01:57:58,200
Yeah, like, look how long they get to live out here.

3522
01:57:58,360 --> 01:57:58,500
Oh!

3523
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:00,200
Yeah.

3524
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:02,100
We're gonna definitely do that next game.

3525
01:58:02,260 --> 01:58:02,980
It's okay, guys.

3526
01:58:02,980 --> 01:58:05,980
We saved the environment by planting trees.

3527
01:58:06,500 --> 01:58:09,780
We planted, like, at least five trees.

3528
01:58:12,540 --> 01:58:14,300
Bro, they hate trees.

3529
01:58:14,580 --> 01:58:16,460
These guys hate the environment!

3530
01:58:17,240 --> 01:58:17,840
Cancel them!

3531
01:58:18,360 --> 01:58:21,320
They don't want MrBeast to save the world or Fortnite.

3532
01:58:21,320 --> 01:58:21,960
Exactly!

3533
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:26,200
They could've let everyone just plant trees.

3534
01:58:26,720 --> 01:58:27,400
Exactly!

3535
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:29,780
They also don't even want anyone to have houses.

3536
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:30,400
They're buying?

3537
01:58:31,260 --> 01:58:31,980
Wait, what?

3538
01:58:32,220 --> 01:58:33,800
They did not have shields.

3539
01:58:33,880 --> 01:58:34,600
That's crazy.

3540
01:58:36,100 --> 01:58:37,220
They can shop?

3541
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:39,800
Yeah, if you have enough gold.

3542
01:58:40,020 --> 01:58:42,280
I think they've been, like, getting a lot of gold from the chests.

3543
01:58:42,660 --> 01:58:44,580
They can basically just keep on healing.

3544
01:58:44,900 --> 01:58:45,560
What the fuck?

3545
01:58:47,240 --> 01:58:48,620
These guys are just healing!

3546
01:58:51,500 --> 01:58:53,320
I thought buying wasn't allowed.

3547
01:58:56,520 --> 01:58:57,540
No, buying's allowed.

3548
01:58:58,500 --> 01:58:59,300
You can get the gold each game.

3549
01:59:00,120 --> 01:59:02,000
So you have to literally start from zero.

3550
01:59:02,580 --> 01:59:04,160
Oh, I thought, like, I saw in the...

3551
01:59:04,160 --> 01:59:05,120
Maybe that's for day two.

3552
01:59:05,940 --> 01:59:07,320
Oh, that might be, um...

3553
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:08,580
Yeah, tomorrow or whatever.

3554
01:59:12,910 --> 01:59:14,310
Yeah, I think that was day two.

3555
01:59:15,050 --> 01:59:17,890
I'll send Fortnite an email and tell them to make me a Fortnite skin.

3556
01:59:19,510 --> 01:59:24,010
Yeah, you gotta be your own skin and then they're gonna throw a little Chris's hat on you.

3557
01:59:24,770 --> 01:59:27,470
It's like, make me a Fortnite skin.

3558
01:59:27,790 --> 01:59:29,990
I would be a Fortnite streamer if you give me

3559
01:59:33,290 --> 01:59:34,090
a day two.

3560
01:59:34,090 --> 01:59:35,730
They kind of have my skin in the game.

3561
01:59:35,790 --> 01:59:36,690
There's a werewolf in here.

3562
01:59:39,270 --> 01:59:41,710
I usually like running the werewolf team.

3563
01:59:41,970 --> 01:59:45,390
And there is a day two, but we're not making it to day two.

3564
01:59:46,550 --> 01:59:47,130
Wait, isn't...

3565
01:59:47,130 --> 01:59:48,510
What if we actually do make it to day two?

3566
01:59:48,590 --> 01:59:50,390
Isn't day two, like, you gotta make it?

3567
01:59:51,650 --> 01:59:52,050
Um...

3568
01:59:52,050 --> 01:59:54,930
Do we have to play day two?

3569
01:59:57,090 --> 01:59:57,550
Um...

3570
01:59:57,550 --> 01:59:58,650
I thought day...

3571
01:59:59,350 --> 02:00:01,190
Oh, wait, no, I think we are playing day two.

3572
02:00:01,390 --> 02:00:02,270
I'm pretty sure.

3573
02:00:02,830 --> 02:00:03,790
Are we playing day two?

3574
02:00:04,670 --> 02:00:05,550
I thought...

3575
02:00:06,030 --> 02:00:09,270
I thought day two was like, we gotta make it.

3576
02:00:09,790 --> 02:00:10,050
I...

3577
02:00:11,330 --> 02:00:13,470
No, I think we're actually playing day two.

3578
02:00:13,850 --> 02:00:16,310
Wait, what the fuck?

3579
02:00:16,390 --> 02:00:16,810
But it's just the same game.

3580
02:00:16,810 --> 02:00:18,050
A whole number of first place finishes.

3581
02:00:20,870 --> 02:00:22,490
A whole number of elims.

3582
02:00:24,770 --> 02:00:26,210
Wait, why is there a day two?

3583
02:00:27,190 --> 02:00:28,930
Uh, it's gonna be on normal mode.

3584
02:00:29,130 --> 02:00:30,670
So it won't even be on OG.

3585
02:00:31,030 --> 02:00:32,330
It's just gonna be like all the...

3586
02:00:33,310 --> 02:00:34,470
All the, like, new stuff.

3587
02:00:36,750 --> 02:00:37,110
Huh?

3588
02:00:37,490 --> 02:00:38,610
Wait, I think...

3589
02:00:38,610 --> 02:00:40,130
Yeah, let's see, placement points are assigned.

3590
02:00:42,590 --> 02:00:43,930
Yeah, I think we played day two.

3591
02:00:44,250 --> 02:00:44,870
We played day two?

3592
02:00:44,890 --> 02:00:46,490
I don't see anything saying that we have to qualify.

3593
02:00:46,650 --> 02:00:47,770
Yeah, we literally just played day two.

3594
02:00:48,070 --> 02:00:49,530
But, like, what's the point?

3595
02:00:52,490 --> 02:00:53,610
Suffer more, Joki!

3596
02:00:53,950 --> 02:00:54,430
But...

3597
02:00:55,550 --> 02:00:56,930
It's just the same game!

3598
02:00:57,170 --> 02:00:59,470
Wait, what's the difference between day one and day two?

3599
02:01:00,290 --> 02:01:01,090
Wait, what, the build?

3600
02:01:01,870 --> 02:01:05,490
On day two, it's gonna be the current build of the game.

3601
02:01:05,650 --> 02:01:08,250
Cause this is like a special mode that came out.

3602
02:01:08,310 --> 02:01:10,030
Oh, this is three strikes.

3603
02:01:10,710 --> 02:01:11,990
Yeah, it's like three strikes, Mesa.

3604
02:01:11,990 --> 02:01:12,830
This is three strikes.

3605
02:01:13,110 --> 02:01:14,890
And then the other ones can be like regular.

3606
02:01:15,350 --> 02:01:17,270
Wait, so does the regular...

3607
02:01:17,270 --> 02:01:19,270
Does the regular also have bunkers?

3608
02:01:20,150 --> 02:01:21,810
Um, regular has...

3609
02:01:22,490 --> 02:01:23,270
It does have bunkers, but...

3610
02:01:23,270 --> 02:01:23,930
What's the difference?

3611
02:01:24,730 --> 02:01:27,230
There is way more...

3612
02:01:27,230 --> 02:01:32,170
There's like different weapons and different like movement items and all that stuff.

3613
02:01:32,370 --> 02:01:35,790
So, it's like a way, way different like style of the game.

3614
02:01:36,070 --> 02:01:37,130
I see.

3615
02:01:39,410 --> 02:01:39,930
Oh!

3616
02:01:40,930 --> 02:01:42,530
It's just no reboots.

3617
02:01:42,790 --> 02:01:44,150
Yeah, no reboots.

3618
02:01:44,390 --> 02:01:46,470
Alright guys, we're gonna plant more trees tomorrow.

3619
02:01:50,370 --> 02:01:52,550
Guys, I read the rules wrong.

3620
02:01:52,750 --> 02:01:53,650
I thought it was...

3621
02:01:53,650 --> 02:01:56,050
I thought like day one is like qualifiers.

3622
02:01:56,690 --> 02:02:01,010
And then day two is like if you don't qualify, you don't have to play it.

3623
02:02:01,110 --> 02:02:02,590
So, I was like, I'm not gonna qualify.

3624
02:02:04,110 --> 02:02:05,670
What I don't see is like...

3625
02:02:05,670 --> 02:02:08,030
I don't know like what place gets paid what.

3626
02:02:09,470 --> 02:02:09,870
Oh no.

3627
02:02:09,870 --> 02:02:13,290
Cause like whenever I played in Twitch Rivals, it's usually everyone gets like paid.

3628
02:02:13,470 --> 02:02:14,550
Yeah, no, everybody gets paid.

3629
02:02:14,670 --> 02:02:14,890
Yeah.

3630
02:02:15,390 --> 02:02:16,170
Oh, that's cool.

3631
02:02:16,470 --> 02:02:16,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3632
02:02:17,070 --> 02:02:17,830
So, we just have to exist.

3633
02:02:18,130 --> 02:02:18,930
Yeah, exactly.

3634
02:02:19,050 --> 02:02:20,390
We just have to exist.

3635
02:02:20,470 --> 02:02:21,030
There's...

3636
02:02:21,730 --> 02:02:26,050
We get like literally $125 by just existing.

3637
02:02:26,450 --> 02:02:28,150
It's 125 McChickens.

3638
02:02:28,150 --> 02:02:29,570
Yeah, that's actually pretty good.

3639
02:02:30,810 --> 02:02:32,570
$125 just by existing?

3640
02:02:33,250 --> 02:02:34,190
And we're ha...

3641
02:02:34,190 --> 02:02:35,110
We're making memories.

3642
02:02:35,270 --> 02:02:36,510
We're having a good time.

3643
02:02:36,930 --> 02:02:39,410
We're literally watching houses get built.

3644
02:02:39,510 --> 02:02:41,150
We're watching trees get planted.

3645
02:02:41,450 --> 02:02:41,910
Exactly.

3646
02:02:41,910 --> 02:02:43,070
We're planting the trees.

3647
02:02:43,750 --> 02:02:46,110
And we're also doing it together.

3648
02:02:46,470 --> 02:02:50,670
Now I understand why the three Fortnite pros were like, I can't do two days with her.

3649
02:02:54,930 --> 02:02:56,350
Cause like, I get...

3650
02:02:56,350 --> 02:02:59,250
I like feel like one day then they're fine with that.

3651
02:02:59,430 --> 02:03:02,770
But like two days might be like a bit too much with me.

3652
02:03:04,430 --> 02:03:04,950
Never.

3653
02:03:04,950 --> 02:03:10,790
They just don't know how insanely cracked you are the moment that you get your time to shine.

3654
02:03:11,250 --> 02:03:11,870
Yeah, exactly.

3655
02:03:11,870 --> 02:03:12,990
This is just the beginning arc.

3656
02:03:13,010 --> 02:03:14,830
We didn't have time to shine yet.

3657
02:03:14,930 --> 02:03:15,970
We didn't have...

3658
02:03:16,470 --> 02:03:17,530
We didn't have our moment.

3659
02:03:20,270 --> 02:03:22,610
We didn't have a proper gun fight.

3660
02:03:24,030 --> 02:03:26,890
Basically get to just watch everyone else.

3661
02:03:26,890 --> 02:03:27,450
Yeah, we always got flanked.

3662
02:03:27,990 --> 02:03:30,570
And we're gonna thrive off of everyone else's energy.

3663
02:03:30,870 --> 02:03:31,190
Yeah, yeah.

3664
02:03:31,230 --> 02:03:33,030
Like we're gathering stats.

3665
02:03:33,150 --> 02:03:36,130
Like I'm literally learning how to play the game right now by watching others.

3666
02:03:38,270 --> 02:03:39,510
Oh, thank god.

3667
02:03:39,670 --> 02:03:40,270
Get rid...

3668
02:03:40,270 --> 02:03:41,610
Oh, what the fuck?

3669
02:03:43,410 --> 02:03:44,410
Holy shit!

3670
02:03:44,470 --> 02:03:45,550
Who is this guy?

3671
02:03:47,590 --> 02:03:49,710
I love that they're using the mammoth pistol.

3672
02:03:49,850 --> 02:03:51,650
That's that like revolver that they're using.

3673
02:03:51,750 --> 02:03:52,630
Oh my god!

3674
02:03:53,150 --> 02:03:55,370
That pistol's actually so good.

3675
02:03:55,610 --> 02:03:55,970
That guy's crazy!

3676
02:03:57,110 --> 02:03:58,010
Oh, never mind.

3677
02:03:58,110 --> 02:03:58,290
TG.

3678
02:03:58,710 --> 02:04:00,630
Get fucking comedy occurs.

3679
02:04:04,110 --> 02:04:05,290
That's fucking right.

3680
02:04:05,850 --> 02:04:07,290
Oh, it's my condoms!

3681
02:04:07,870 --> 02:04:09,350
The reboot's disabled.

3682
02:04:09,710 --> 02:04:10,930
Oh, it's the condoms again!

3683
02:04:13,570 --> 02:04:14,530
I feel like the storm doesn't hurt as much.

3684
02:04:14,530 --> 02:04:15,610
Why are they spamming bunkers?

3685
02:04:15,690 --> 02:04:16,290
Because that...

3686
02:04:16,470 --> 02:04:18,210
This is build mode.

3687
02:04:18,270 --> 02:04:19,270
I mean zero build mode.

3688
02:04:21,030 --> 02:04:21,810
Sorry, I had something in my throat.

3689
02:04:21,810 --> 02:04:22,770
He's gonna die in zone.

3690
02:04:24,570 --> 02:04:25,570
Where's he gonna live?

3691
02:04:26,650 --> 02:04:28,030
Oh, by building a house.

3692
02:04:28,070 --> 02:04:29,030
That sounds right.

3693
02:04:32,090 --> 02:04:33,210
Oh, condom down!

3694
02:04:33,350 --> 02:04:33,790
Condom down!

3695
02:04:34,130 --> 02:04:34,410
Woah!

3696
02:04:34,630 --> 02:04:36,370
He's just throwing their game!

3697
02:04:37,650 --> 02:04:38,330
Condom dead!

3698
02:04:39,310 --> 02:04:40,530
By the other condoms.

3699
02:04:40,550 --> 02:04:42,190
What the fuck was that flick?

3700
02:04:42,530 --> 02:04:44,590
He actually hit it too!

3701
02:04:44,590 --> 02:04:45,530
Yay!

3702
02:04:46,110 --> 02:04:47,450
Oh, this guy's actually one HP.

3703
02:04:48,310 --> 02:04:49,210
Oh my god.

3704
02:04:51,890 --> 02:04:53,550
Wait, why is he dropping a weapon?

3705
02:04:53,850 --> 02:04:54,770
He has enough slots.

3706
02:04:58,910 --> 02:05:01,150
Wait, why did he drop his weapon?

3707
02:05:01,190 --> 02:05:02,510
I don't understand Fortnite players.

3708
02:05:04,250 --> 02:05:06,270
He has enough item slots for this.

3709
02:05:06,910 --> 02:05:07,390
Oh?

3710
02:05:07,490 --> 02:05:09,830
Oh, they get to splash some HP?

3711
02:05:10,210 --> 02:05:10,650
He's dead.

3712
02:05:10,850 --> 02:05:11,450
There's no... yeah.

3713
02:05:12,410 --> 02:05:14,670
Oh, that's a skin I haven't seen before!

3714
02:05:15,250 --> 02:05:15,810
Wait, which one?

3715
02:05:15,930 --> 02:05:17,130
Oh, I I'm going to another team.

3716
02:05:17,250 --> 02:05:17,870
Oh my god.

3717
02:05:18,170 --> 02:05:20,130
They actually have not matching skins.

3718
02:05:20,750 --> 02:05:21,770
I like this team.

3719
02:05:22,230 --> 02:05:23,130
Wait, this is a team.

3720
02:05:23,230 --> 02:05:23,870
Oh, it's this guy!

3721
02:05:23,930 --> 02:05:24,490
They swapped skins!

3722
02:05:26,130 --> 02:05:26,750
Wait, which one?

3723
02:05:26,790 --> 02:05:28,210
Oh, is it the guys with the pink skirt?

3724
02:05:28,470 --> 02:05:29,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3725
02:05:29,150 --> 02:05:30,890
They actually have skins that don't match.

3726
02:05:31,230 --> 02:05:31,570
Yo!

3727
02:05:31,970 --> 02:05:33,910
He actually had color in their skin.

3728
02:05:35,150 --> 02:05:35,910
That's crazy.

3729
02:05:37,090 --> 02:05:38,470
Seeing, like, actual color.

3730
02:05:40,630 --> 02:05:41,030
Oh?

3731
02:05:41,190 --> 02:05:42,030
The guy's gonna heal?

3732
02:05:44,130 --> 02:05:46,450
There's still, like, there's still so many teams.

3733
02:05:46,470 --> 02:05:47,010
What the fuck?

3734
02:05:47,550 --> 02:05:47,950
Oh?

3735
02:05:50,350 --> 02:05:57,870
I love watching this with you because, like, even though I know what's going on, it's why I don't play this game competitively.

3736
02:05:57,870 --> 02:06:00,130
Because the tick rate is horrible in this game.

3737
02:06:00,270 --> 02:06:00,770
Oh, is it?

3738
02:06:01,050 --> 02:06:04,350
And then, yeah, in, like, in zero build, it's literally, like, diet build mode.

3739
02:06:04,650 --> 02:06:07,730
And for me, I'm just like, yo, I'm not trying to play diet build mode.

3740
02:06:07,830 --> 02:06:10,170
Like, I chose zero build for WQ.

3741
02:06:12,510 --> 02:06:13,210
You really?

3742
02:06:13,370 --> 02:06:14,430
I wish you can just edit.

3743
02:06:14,670 --> 02:06:17,290
Like, the organizers just don't tell anybody.

3744
02:06:17,610 --> 02:06:21,250
They just edit the bunker to, like, one percent spawn rate.

3745
02:06:21,490 --> 02:06:22,730
I wish you could just do that.

3746
02:06:23,750 --> 02:06:25,430
Oh, that'd be so sick.

3747
02:06:25,610 --> 02:06:25,790
For one game!

3748
02:06:25,790 --> 02:06:29,250
For one game, they edit the spawn rate to one percent.

3749
02:06:29,310 --> 02:06:30,690
And I just wanna know what they're gonna do.

3750
02:06:30,870 --> 02:06:33,830
I wanna know what the players would do.

3751
02:06:35,970 --> 02:06:36,870
What do we do?

3752
02:06:36,930 --> 02:06:37,270
What do we do?

3753
02:06:37,310 --> 02:06:37,750
I can't build.

3754
02:06:37,870 --> 02:06:38,370
I can't build!

3755
02:06:38,510 --> 02:06:38,870
I can't believe it.

3756
02:06:38,870 --> 02:06:41,070
The place I landed had no bunkers.

3757
02:06:41,070 --> 02:06:42,190
Like, what is my luck?

3758
02:06:42,190 --> 02:06:47,250
And then everybody just doesn't know that it's not that they have terrible luck, it's that it just wasn't spawning.

3759
02:06:47,670 --> 02:06:48,070
Right?

3760
02:06:48,210 --> 02:06:50,990
It's like, my RNG is horrible, actually.

3761
02:06:53,450 --> 02:06:54,570
I'm rooting for this team.

3762
02:06:54,690 --> 02:06:55,630
The colourful team.

3763
02:06:55,830 --> 02:06:56,690
Yeah, the colourful team.

3764
02:06:56,730 --> 02:06:59,010
As long as they beat the condom team, that's all that matters.

3765
02:07:00,330 --> 02:07:01,610
That's all that matters to me.

3766
02:07:02,030 --> 02:07:03,150
Oh, they shotgun waving now?

3767
02:07:03,730 --> 02:07:04,130
Oh!

3768
02:07:05,270 --> 02:07:09,390
Oh my god, the reaction time for... and then they built a... they rebuilt the house.

3769
02:07:09,710 --> 02:07:10,110
Right?

3770
02:07:10,110 --> 02:07:12,850
They actually rebuilt the house.

3771
02:07:13,090 --> 02:07:13,910
Holy shit.

3772
02:07:14,850 --> 02:07:16,310
What the fuck?

3773
02:07:16,810 --> 02:07:17,830
Did they, like, shotgun wave?

3774
02:07:17,830 --> 02:07:21,230
The crazy thing is that this is only slightly sweatier than normal reload lobbies.

3775
02:07:21,470 --> 02:07:26,150
I wouldn't say slightly, like, it's definitely sweatier, but, like, reload lobbies are pretty sweaty.

3776
02:07:26,630 --> 02:07:29,110
They're, like, diet rank mode.

3777
02:07:32,710 --> 02:07:33,650
Oh my god.

3778
02:07:33,930 --> 02:07:35,270
Are they gonna shotgun him out?

3779
02:07:35,510 --> 02:07:36,650
Is that a shotgun wave?

3780
02:07:38,470 --> 02:07:38,990
Wait.

3781
02:07:39,650 --> 02:07:41,390
How come we can't do that together?

3782
02:07:41,670 --> 02:07:42,070
Oh, they're gonna...

3783
02:07:42,150 --> 02:07:43,050
They're gonna build a house.

3784
02:07:43,170 --> 02:07:43,770
They're gonna build a house.

3785
02:07:43,970 --> 02:07:44,390
Oh my god.

3786
02:07:44,410 --> 02:07:44,810
They did it.

3787
02:07:44,830 --> 02:07:45,470
They built the house.

3788
02:07:47,090 --> 02:07:48,210
Let's go, colorful team!

3789
02:07:51,250 --> 02:07:52,510
Oh, and they're destroying...

3790
02:07:52,510 --> 02:07:53,150
Oh, no.

3791
02:07:53,230 --> 02:07:53,530
They fucked up.

3792
02:07:53,530 --> 02:07:53,910
They missed that one.

3793
02:07:54,090 --> 02:07:54,350
Oh, yeah.

3794
02:07:54,510 --> 02:07:56,350
How do you hit it so that it destroys it?

3795
02:07:57,410 --> 02:08:01,910
You have to basically throw it at an angle where it's gonna connect with the player next to it.

3796
02:08:02,190 --> 02:08:02,930
And then it launches them out.

3797
02:08:02,930 --> 02:08:03,990
Oh, so it has to connect to the player.

3798
02:08:04,030 --> 02:08:05,830
Oh, so the launch breaks the house.

3799
02:08:06,150 --> 02:08:07,270
It has to be, like, an LOS.

3800
02:08:07,270 --> 02:08:07,570
Yeah.

3801
02:08:07,870 --> 02:08:08,190
Oh!

3802
02:08:09,030 --> 02:08:09,750
That makes sense.

3803
02:08:09,810 --> 02:08:10,010
Wait.

3804
02:08:10,170 --> 02:08:11,290
Somebody's living behind them.

3805
02:08:11,650 --> 02:08:12,050
There's people.

3806
02:08:12,050 --> 02:08:12,130
There's people.

3807
02:08:12,130 --> 02:08:12,510
Oh, the squatters.

3808
02:08:13,570 --> 02:08:15,130
Oh, the squatters are gone.

3809
02:08:15,670 --> 02:08:17,270
Let's go, colorful team!

3810
02:08:17,770 --> 02:08:18,250
Yeah!

3811
02:08:18,350 --> 02:08:19,010
Colorful team!

3812
02:08:19,990 --> 02:08:20,750
Oh, shit.

3813
02:08:20,910 --> 02:08:22,170
Who the fuck shot him?

3814
02:08:22,690 --> 02:08:23,130
Yeah, right?

3815
02:08:23,410 --> 02:08:23,830
Yeah.

3816
02:08:23,930 --> 02:08:25,350
Who the fuck shot him?

3817
02:08:25,350 --> 02:08:25,770
Oh, shush.

3818
02:08:26,190 --> 02:08:26,670
Shush.

3819
02:08:26,710 --> 02:08:27,210
Get out of here.

3820
02:08:27,370 --> 02:08:29,670
Dude's shooting our pink...

3821
02:08:29,670 --> 02:08:30,110
Oh, no.

3822
02:08:30,130 --> 02:08:30,470
Don't worry.

3823
02:08:30,570 --> 02:08:30,930
They have...

3824
02:08:30,930 --> 02:08:32,790
He's holding a port-a-potty.

3825
02:08:33,030 --> 02:08:34,250
He's holding it.

3826
02:08:35,130 --> 02:08:36,250
Port-a-potty.

3827
02:08:36,250 --> 02:08:38,070
He's holding the port-a-potty.

3828
02:08:38,250 --> 02:08:40,710
I'm gonna start calling it a port-a-potty and a house now.

3829
02:08:41,390 --> 02:08:42,110
We'll back up.

3830
02:08:43,030 --> 02:08:43,830
Holy shit.

3831
02:08:43,890 --> 02:08:44,990
What the fuck?

3832
02:08:45,870 --> 02:08:46,270
No.

3833
02:08:46,770 --> 02:08:47,170
No.

3834
02:08:47,350 --> 02:08:48,690
Is it condom versus condom?

3835
02:08:48,750 --> 02:08:49,830
There's one solo alive.

3836
02:08:50,190 --> 02:08:50,270
Wait.

3837
02:08:50,350 --> 02:08:50,810
Who's the solo?

3838
02:08:50,990 --> 02:08:51,730
Oh, the solo.

3839
02:08:51,810 --> 02:08:54,290
There's one solo non-condom team alive.

3840
02:08:54,730 --> 02:08:55,270
Let's see.

3841
02:08:55,370 --> 02:08:55,650
Wait.

3842
02:08:55,770 --> 02:08:56,550
Oh, is it non-condom?

3843
02:08:56,750 --> 02:08:57,030
Yeah.

3844
02:08:57,070 --> 02:08:57,190
Yeah.

3845
02:08:57,210 --> 02:08:57,410
Yeah.

3846
02:08:57,410 --> 02:08:57,530
Yeah.

3847
02:08:57,530 --> 02:08:58,070
We literally...

3848
02:08:58,070 --> 02:08:59,150
He literally has one...

3849
02:08:59,710 --> 02:09:00,110
Wait.

3850
02:09:00,350 --> 02:09:00,750
No.

3851
02:09:00,790 --> 02:09:01,530
It's actually a full team.

3852
02:09:01,530 --> 02:09:02,210
It's actually a full team.

3853
02:09:02,810 --> 02:09:03,210
Yeah!

3854
02:09:03,390 --> 02:09:04,290
They did it!

3855
02:09:04,490 --> 02:09:05,950
The non-condoms won.

3856
02:09:06,550 --> 02:09:07,150
Let's go.

3857
02:09:07,210 --> 02:09:07,610
They had zone.

3858
02:09:07,770 --> 02:09:08,570
They had zone.

3859
02:09:08,570 --> 02:09:12,070
And they just built, like, several fucking bunkers to make their own building.

3860
02:09:12,630 --> 02:09:13,030
Dang.

3861
02:09:13,270 --> 02:09:13,830
What is that?

3862
02:09:13,890 --> 02:09:15,110
Three games out of five?

3863
02:09:15,350 --> 02:09:16,970
That, like, they're all non-condoms?

3864
02:09:17,250 --> 02:09:17,510
Yeah.

3865
02:09:17,510 --> 02:09:18,330
They're all non...

3866
02:09:18,330 --> 02:09:19,930
They're all non-condoms.

3867
02:09:20,230 --> 02:09:24,210
I mean, they still have small ass hitbox because they're playing, like, the girl skins.

3868
02:09:24,590 --> 02:09:24,990
But...

3869
02:09:24,990 --> 02:09:25,290
Yeah.

3870
02:09:25,390 --> 02:09:26,290
Maybe we should...

3871
02:09:26,290 --> 02:09:27,610
Our next team should be the girls.

3872
02:09:28,210 --> 02:09:28,610
Yeah.

3873
02:09:28,690 --> 02:09:29,830
What skin do you want to run?

3874
02:09:29,950 --> 02:09:30,090
Okay.

3875
02:09:30,090 --> 02:09:30,210
Wait.

3876
02:09:30,590 --> 02:09:31,910
What girl skins do we have?

3877
02:09:31,990 --> 02:09:32,830
I don't think I have any.

3878
02:09:33,450 --> 02:09:33,850
Wait.

3879
02:09:35,030 --> 02:09:35,430
Really?

3880
02:09:35,430 --> 02:09:36,310
I don't think so.

3881
02:09:36,470 --> 02:09:36,910
I think I...

3882
02:09:36,910 --> 02:09:38,150
All my skins are guys.

3883
02:09:38,330 --> 02:09:38,930
Because they're...

3884
02:09:38,930 --> 02:09:39,090
Wait.

3885
02:09:39,090 --> 02:09:40,790
Do you have any, like, furry character skins?

3886
02:09:41,250 --> 02:09:41,810
Let's see.

3887
02:09:42,590 --> 02:09:43,250
Because there...

3888
02:09:43,250 --> 02:09:44,450
There's some girl skins in that, too.

3889
02:09:44,670 --> 02:09:44,710
Wait.

3890
02:09:44,710 --> 02:09:45,970
I have Eevee.

3891
02:09:45,990 --> 02:09:46,970
Oh, I have her.

3892
02:09:47,230 --> 02:09:47,670
Adria.

3893
02:09:48,490 --> 02:09:49,050
And then...

3894
02:09:49,050 --> 02:09:49,530
Wait.

3895
02:09:49,530 --> 02:09:49,850
Put it on.

3896
02:09:49,910 --> 02:09:50,570
I don't fucking know.

3897
02:09:50,710 --> 02:09:52,290
Like, I don't know what this is from.

3898
02:09:52,610 --> 02:09:53,770
I don't know.

3899
02:09:53,770 --> 02:09:54,190
Oh!

3900
02:09:54,510 --> 02:09:56,150
I don't know what it is.

3901
02:09:56,250 --> 02:09:58,470
I have the 2D at 2.0.

3902
02:09:58,470 --> 02:09:58,690
She's...

3903
02:09:58,690 --> 02:10:01,250
She's from the very first season of Zero Build, I think.

3904
02:10:01,490 --> 02:10:01,550
Oh!

3905
02:10:03,270 --> 02:10:04,050
It's like when I...

3906
02:10:04,050 --> 02:10:04,690
I have Oscar.

3907
02:10:05,430 --> 02:10:09,210
I literally did not play Fortnite until Zero Build came out.

3908
02:10:09,510 --> 02:10:11,150
And then, like, I played it for a little bit.

3909
02:10:11,530 --> 02:10:13,710
And I was like, alright, there's tanks in this game.

3910
02:10:13,830 --> 02:10:14,230
I'm good.

3911
02:10:14,270 --> 02:10:15,170
I went back to Apex.

3912
02:10:18,490 --> 02:10:18,850
Oh!

3913
02:10:19,010 --> 02:10:19,610
You have Oscar.

3914
02:10:19,770 --> 02:10:20,650
I have Oscar.

3915
02:10:21,650 --> 02:10:22,010
Wait.

3916
02:10:22,790 --> 02:10:26,770
If you're gonna be Oscar, should I be the shark?

3917
02:10:27,290 --> 02:10:28,130
Should I be this guy?

3918
02:10:28,230 --> 02:10:28,370
Wait.

3919
02:10:31,750 --> 02:10:33,130
This is ZZZ.

3920
02:10:34,550 --> 02:10:38,650
Or should I also be a different variant of Oscar?

3921
02:10:40,050 --> 02:10:40,910
This is...

3922
02:10:40,910 --> 02:10:41,850
This is Doking.

3923
02:10:44,170 --> 02:10:45,850
I could be, um...

3924
02:10:45,850 --> 02:10:47,230
Oh, where's the other one?

3925
02:10:47,370 --> 02:10:47,750
Show me the tiger.

3926
02:10:49,170 --> 02:10:50,250
Oh, my God!

3927
02:10:58,550 --> 02:11:00,070
Is this a squad?

3928
02:11:00,230 --> 02:11:00,730
Is this it?

3929
02:11:00,890 --> 02:11:01,690
Oh, my God.

3930
02:11:01,690 --> 02:11:02,730
What the fuck?

3931
02:11:03,830 --> 02:11:06,410
Why are fucking hitboxes so big?

3932
02:11:06,730 --> 02:11:07,290
Oh, my God.

3933
02:11:08,270 --> 02:11:09,450
Bro, I don't know.

3934
02:11:09,510 --> 02:11:11,210
I don't know if I'm a hitbox, though.

3935
02:11:11,730 --> 02:11:13,630
I'm wearing a butter hitbox.

3936
02:11:13,630 --> 02:11:14,250
Alright, what...

3937
02:11:14,250 --> 02:11:15,150
Wanna be, um...

3938
02:11:15,150 --> 02:11:16,210
You wanna be the, um...

3939
02:11:16,210 --> 02:11:17,990
Hey, I have tomato, boy!

3940
02:11:18,070 --> 02:11:18,730
I have a classic!

3941
02:11:19,490 --> 02:11:20,350
Oh, be food!

3942
02:11:20,610 --> 02:11:21,070
Be food!

3943
02:11:21,210 --> 02:11:21,910
I have tomato, hey!

3944
02:11:22,230 --> 02:11:22,630
I can...

3945
02:11:22,630 --> 02:11:23,810
I can be a food skin, too.

3946
02:11:24,050 --> 02:11:24,570
Oh, my God!

3947
02:11:25,670 --> 02:11:26,430
Here, let me...

3948
02:11:26,430 --> 02:11:26,950
Let me swap.

3949
02:11:27,110 --> 02:11:27,670
Let me swap mine.

3950
02:11:30,090 --> 02:11:30,950
Oh, my God.

3951
02:11:30,970 --> 02:11:31,230
Okay.

3952
02:11:31,390 --> 02:11:32,050
I wanna...

3953
02:11:32,930 --> 02:11:33,990
I'm gonna be food.

3954
02:11:34,470 --> 02:11:35,870
Doking, you already be food.

3955
02:11:36,190 --> 02:11:37,070
I'm gonna be food.

3956
02:11:37,270 --> 02:11:37,750
What I...

3957
02:11:38,710 --> 02:11:39,450
Yes!

3958
02:11:39,850 --> 02:11:40,410
Wait!

3959
02:11:40,530 --> 02:11:41,450
That's so good!

3960
02:11:44,510 --> 02:11:46,410
Oh, my God!

3961
02:11:46,570 --> 02:11:47,850
This is so good!

3962
02:11:49,890 --> 02:11:51,510
Tomato and corn.

3963
02:11:56,850 --> 02:11:58,710
The perfect duo.

3964
02:12:00,570 --> 02:12:01,730
Where's my gritty?

3965
02:12:01,910 --> 02:12:02,250
Yeah.

3966
02:12:02,890 --> 02:12:03,770
Let's go.

3967
02:12:04,690 --> 02:12:06,530
Team tomato and corn.

3968
02:12:06,730 --> 02:12:07,250
Oh, my God.

3969
02:12:12,170 --> 02:12:13,430
Eat your veggies!

3970
02:12:14,290 --> 02:12:15,390
Eat your vegetables!

3971
02:12:15,630 --> 02:12:17,550
Eat your vegetables, guys!

3972
02:12:18,010 --> 02:12:19,730
Now I wish I had more Fortnite skins.

3973
02:12:20,270 --> 02:12:21,910
I could also be um...

3974
02:12:21,910 --> 02:12:26,510
Now that I have two days of Fortnite, I wish I had more Fortnite skins.

3975
02:12:27,050 --> 02:12:29,630
I'm about to literally just gift you some random ass cursed skins.

3976
02:12:29,890 --> 02:12:31,410
Now that we have each other added.

3977
02:12:32,650 --> 02:12:33,530
Oh my god!

3978
02:12:33,530 --> 02:12:37,310
Oh my god, I remember there's like this funky ass emote with these guys.

3979
02:12:37,550 --> 02:12:37,930
Isn't there?

3980
02:12:38,570 --> 02:12:39,210
You have it?

3981
02:12:39,370 --> 02:12:39,930
Oh, with this guy?

3982
02:12:40,010 --> 02:12:41,790
Oh yeah, you're talking about the one from the Battle Pass, right?

3983
02:12:41,870 --> 02:12:42,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3984
02:12:43,010 --> 02:12:44,490
I saw it on Twitter.

3985
02:12:45,150 --> 02:12:46,190
Oh, where is it?

3986
02:12:46,230 --> 02:12:46,870
You have it?

3987
02:12:46,890 --> 02:12:47,670
I can't remember what it's called.

3988
02:12:47,730 --> 02:12:48,350
I do have it unlocked.

3989
02:12:48,450 --> 02:12:48,690
Yeah.

3990
02:12:50,170 --> 02:12:51,010
Is it this one?

3991
02:12:51,730 --> 02:12:52,390
Yeah, here it is.

3992
02:12:52,450 --> 02:12:53,370
We're eating protein veggies.

3993
02:12:54,670 --> 02:12:55,790
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

3994
02:12:56,410 --> 02:12:57,050
It's this one.

3995
02:13:07,330 --> 02:13:08,310
Yeah, I saw it!

3996
02:13:08,530 --> 02:13:11,370
I saw the fucking emote.

3997
02:13:11,410 --> 02:13:11,690
I was like, what?

3998
02:13:11,710 --> 02:13:12,230
What the fuck?

3999
02:13:13,850 --> 02:13:16,610
Oh, did they have the code out yet?

4000
02:13:17,250 --> 02:13:18,970
Yeah, they just posted it.

4001
02:13:19,030 --> 02:13:19,270
Nice.

4002
02:13:19,270 --> 02:13:20,030
Okay, I was gonna say.

4003
02:13:20,110 --> 02:13:22,290
I was like, it'll be funny when you missed it again.

4004
02:13:22,990 --> 02:13:23,730
All right, we good.

4005
02:13:23,930 --> 02:13:24,110
We good.

4006
02:13:24,410 --> 02:13:25,230
All right, go ahead and ready up.

4007
02:13:25,890 --> 02:13:26,210
Nice.

4008
02:13:27,350 --> 02:13:28,410
Wait, what are you using for your...

4009
02:13:28,410 --> 02:13:28,790
Oh my god, two veggies.

4010
02:13:30,050 --> 02:13:31,430
What are you using for your pickaxe?

4011
02:13:31,510 --> 02:13:33,270
I'm using the poultry pummelers.

4012
02:13:34,070 --> 02:13:35,190
Oh, the poultry pummelers.

4013
02:13:35,290 --> 02:13:36,410
I'm gonna beat them up with meat.

4014
02:13:36,990 --> 02:13:38,390
Oh, is that the ones in the shop right now?

4015
02:13:39,890 --> 02:13:41,250
I don't think so.

4016
02:13:41,250 --> 02:13:42,050
I don't see in the shop.

4017
02:13:42,190 --> 02:13:42,690
I just had...

4018
02:13:42,690 --> 02:13:44,610
I bought it before for the Peter Griffin skin.

4019
02:13:44,970 --> 02:13:45,670
I have...

4020
02:13:45,670 --> 02:13:46,830
I have drumsticks.

4021
02:13:47,370 --> 02:13:47,990
Oh, yeah.

4022
02:13:47,990 --> 02:13:48,370
Yeah.

4023
02:13:48,370 --> 02:13:48,730
Yeah.

4024
02:13:48,730 --> 02:13:48,970
Yeah.

4025
02:13:48,970 --> 02:13:49,130
Yeah.

4026
02:13:50,130 --> 02:13:50,750
That's perfect.

4027
02:13:51,410 --> 02:13:52,770
Okay, I'm doing that one then.

4028
02:13:52,870 --> 02:13:53,550
And then...

4029
02:13:53,550 --> 02:13:55,090
Oh, what's my glider gonna be?

4030
02:13:58,580 --> 02:13:59,500
Wait, do you have the Peter...

4031
02:13:59,500 --> 02:14:00,040
Oh, wait.

4032
02:14:00,100 --> 02:14:00,900
I have the ice cream sandwiches.

4033
02:14:01,220 --> 02:14:02,060
The ice cream sandwiches?

4034
02:14:02,420 --> 02:14:02,580
Oh.

4035
02:14:02,820 --> 02:14:03,140
Yeah.

4036
02:14:03,140 --> 02:14:03,380
Okay.

4037
02:14:03,440 --> 02:14:05,720
My gliders are like...

4038
02:14:05,720 --> 02:14:07,120
I don't have a lot of gliders.

4039
02:14:07,380 --> 02:14:08,520
Not a lot of cool ones.

4040
02:14:09,100 --> 02:14:10,860
I have like a lot of Battle Pass ones.

4041
02:14:11,120 --> 02:14:11,620
I only...

4042
02:14:11,620 --> 02:14:13,420
Like my only cool one is...

4043
02:14:13,420 --> 02:14:15,200
Is literally like Shenron.

4044
02:14:16,360 --> 02:14:17,860
That's literally the only cool one I have.

4045
02:14:17,860 --> 02:14:18,180
Wait, really?

4046
02:14:18,600 --> 02:14:19,740
No, that one is cool though.

4047
02:14:19,880 --> 02:14:20,100
I have a car.

4048
02:14:20,100 --> 02:14:20,500
I like that one.

4049
02:14:20,680 --> 02:14:21,320
I have a car.

4050
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:22,360
I'm gonna fucking...

4051
02:14:22,360 --> 02:14:23,200
Wait, you have a car?

4052
02:14:23,220 --> 02:14:23,660
You have Regalia?

4053
02:14:23,920 --> 02:14:25,400
No, I have like Victory Vaunter.

4054
02:14:25,640 --> 02:14:26,420
I think that was from the...

4055
02:14:26,420 --> 02:14:27,640
I also have the Woolly Mammoth.

4056
02:14:27,680 --> 02:14:29,000
The monster truck.

4057
02:14:30,020 --> 02:14:31,160
Oh, do I have that one?

4058
02:14:31,360 --> 02:14:32,200
The Woolly Mammoth?

4059
02:14:32,200 --> 02:14:32,720
I also have...

4060
02:14:33,060 --> 02:14:33,760
Oh, I have...

4061
02:14:35,760 --> 02:14:37,020
Do you have the inflatable horse?

4062
02:14:37,580 --> 02:14:38,600
The inflatable horse?

4063
02:14:38,680 --> 02:14:38,960
No.

4064
02:14:39,300 --> 02:14:39,620
What?

4065
02:14:39,740 --> 02:14:40,780
Yeah, I think it was like a Witcher.

4066
02:14:41,100 --> 02:14:41,600
It was like a witcher.

4067
02:14:41,600 --> 02:14:42,140
It was like a witcher unlock.

4068
02:14:42,440 --> 02:14:43,420
What the fuck?

4069
02:14:43,460 --> 02:14:44,760
The inflatable horse?

4070
02:14:44,940 --> 02:14:45,320
Yeah, I know.

4071
02:14:45,340 --> 02:14:46,400
I definitely do not have that.

4072
02:14:48,820 --> 02:14:49,300
Yeah.

4073
02:14:49,580 --> 02:14:50,260
Eat your veggies.

4074
02:14:50,260 --> 02:14:52,960
Everyone else is sweating and you two are having fun and vibing.

4075
02:14:53,060 --> 02:14:53,320
Yeah.

4076
02:14:53,620 --> 02:14:55,260
Eat your veggies, everybody.

4077
02:14:55,800 --> 02:14:59,400
Listen, Doki and I assembled literally an hour before the tournament.

4078
02:14:59,400 --> 02:15:00,420
Yeah, we were not ready.

4079
02:15:00,860 --> 02:15:01,780
We are vibing.

4080
02:15:02,240 --> 02:15:02,740
We accept our fate.

4081
02:15:02,740 --> 02:15:06,260
Doki was like the only Fortnite player that was like free.

4082
02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:10,260
I would say we're doing pretty damn good.

4083
02:15:10,300 --> 02:15:11,260
We're doing pretty good.

4084
02:15:11,260 --> 02:15:13,140
We're better than the Overwatch duo.

4085
02:15:13,280 --> 02:15:14,300
That's all that matters.

4086
02:15:14,500 --> 02:15:14,900
Let's go.

4087
02:15:15,560 --> 02:15:16,880
It's like, wait, where's the Mercy res?

4088
02:15:17,860 --> 02:15:19,260
Wait, there's a Mercy res?

4089
02:15:19,840 --> 02:15:21,540
No, that's what the Overwatch players are saying.

4090
02:15:21,560 --> 02:15:22,560
They're like, where's our Mercy res?

4091
02:15:23,380 --> 02:15:24,960
Where's our fucking Reinhardt shield?

4092
02:15:27,220 --> 02:15:28,720
Oh, that's so cute.

4093
02:15:29,800 --> 02:15:33,140
What's the other one that's similar to that?

4094
02:15:33,380 --> 02:15:35,400
Merry Christmas.

4095
02:15:36,460 --> 02:15:37,740
Merry Christmas, everybody.

4096
02:15:39,700 --> 02:15:40,180
Yay.

4097
02:15:40,760 --> 02:15:43,860
I got a P. I mean, are you using the bathroom?

4098
02:15:44,300 --> 02:15:44,740
Yeah.

4099
02:15:44,780 --> 02:15:45,660
How do P's pee?

4100
02:15:46,300 --> 02:15:46,740
Literally.

4101
02:15:47,600 --> 02:15:48,520
Do they even piss?

4102
02:15:48,600 --> 02:15:48,800
Oh my god.

4103
02:15:49,020 --> 02:15:49,460
Zoro.

4104
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:55,320
Yeah.

4105
02:15:55,700 --> 02:15:57,780
I wish I spent more money on Fortnite.

4106
02:15:58,820 --> 02:16:00,960
You're gonna probably get random gifts from me now.

4107
02:16:01,100 --> 02:16:02,820
I like how I have like zero crowns.

4108
02:16:03,540 --> 02:16:05,840
Look at my zero crowns, everybody.

4109
02:16:07,740 --> 02:16:09,240
Yo, zero crowns?

4110
02:16:09,940 --> 02:16:10,900
Yeah, do you have the one too?

4111
02:16:11,200 --> 02:16:11,860
Wait, no.

4112
02:16:12,220 --> 02:16:13,120
Wait, no.

4113
02:16:13,120 --> 02:16:13,720
I didn't.

4114
02:16:13,720 --> 02:16:14,220
I didn't buy it.

4115
02:16:14,220 --> 02:16:15,280
My bird is the worst.

4116
02:16:16,520 --> 02:16:16,880
No.

4117
02:16:17,060 --> 02:16:17,260
No.

4118
02:16:20,400 --> 02:16:20,920
It's okay.

4119
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:21,500
In spirit.

4120
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:23,300
You have bird is the worst.

4121
02:16:23,360 --> 02:16:23,660
Yeah.

4122
02:16:23,780 --> 02:16:26,660
You do bird is the worst for me.

4123
02:16:26,760 --> 02:16:26,940
No.

4124
02:16:27,620 --> 02:16:27,980
No.

4125
02:16:28,140 --> 02:16:28,500
No.

4126
02:16:28,700 --> 02:16:28,720
No.

4127
02:16:28,720 --> 02:16:28,880
No.

4128
02:16:29,860 --> 02:16:31,560
Oh, I love this one.

4129
02:16:32,340 --> 02:16:33,040
What is that?

4130
02:16:33,920 --> 02:16:35,920
He like makes it pretty hard, I think.

4131
02:16:36,680 --> 02:16:37,120
Oh, no.

4132
02:16:37,140 --> 02:16:37,740
He just sparkles.

4133
02:16:37,960 --> 02:16:38,320
Nevermind.

4134
02:16:38,420 --> 02:16:38,900
Oh, there we go.

4135
02:16:38,960 --> 02:16:39,540
He does make the hearts.

4136
02:16:39,720 --> 02:16:40,080
Oh.

4137
02:16:43,020 --> 02:16:43,940
Oh, this is fine.

4138
02:16:44,280 --> 02:16:44,640
Oh.

4139
02:16:45,040 --> 02:16:45,400
Oh.

4140
02:16:45,500 --> 02:16:45,760
Oh.

4141
02:16:45,780 --> 02:16:46,180
Wait.

4142
02:16:46,240 --> 02:16:47,400
That's such a good emote.

4143
02:16:47,620 --> 02:16:47,960
Oh, man.

4144
02:16:48,020 --> 02:16:48,400
I wish I...

4145
02:16:48,400 --> 02:16:49,360
It's so big too.

4146
02:16:49,460 --> 02:16:50,380
Oh, I wish I bought this.

4147
02:16:50,440 --> 02:16:51,620
Like, when you use it in game, it's ridiculous.

4148
02:16:51,800 --> 02:16:52,400
I wish I...

4149
02:16:52,840 --> 02:16:55,620
I wish I bought the Lethal Company dance one.

4150
02:16:55,660 --> 02:16:57,240
Did you buy the Lethal Company dance one?

4151
02:16:58,080 --> 02:16:58,700
Uh, yeah.

4152
02:16:58,740 --> 02:16:59,260
Do you have that one too?

4153
02:16:59,400 --> 02:17:00,420
No, I didn't.

4154
02:17:00,420 --> 02:17:01,460
I wasn't on Fortnite.

4155
02:17:02,380 --> 02:17:02,820
All right.

4156
02:17:02,840 --> 02:17:05,840
You're gonna get gifted the next time it's in the shop.

4157
02:17:05,980 --> 02:17:06,220
Wait, wait.

4158
02:17:06,220 --> 02:17:06,940
What does it look like?

4159
02:17:08,440 --> 02:17:09,120
Um, it's...

4160
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:10,280
Oh, do I have it equipped yet?

4161
02:17:10,980 --> 02:17:11,480
I got...

4162
02:17:11,480 --> 02:17:11,880
Oh, here it is.

4163
02:17:12,840 --> 02:17:13,180
Oh.

4164
02:17:13,380 --> 02:17:13,720
Oh.

4165
02:17:14,860 --> 02:17:15,200
Oh.

4166
02:17:15,420 --> 02:17:15,760
Oh.

4167
02:17:16,620 --> 02:17:17,580
It's so good.

4168
02:17:22,300 --> 02:17:23,380
I love it.

4169
02:17:23,760 --> 02:17:24,880
It's so funny.

4170
02:17:26,860 --> 02:17:29,480
It's so good on, like, all the skins too.

4171
02:17:29,560 --> 02:17:29,800
Yeah.

4172
02:17:29,800 --> 02:17:30,180
Like, every...

4173
02:17:30,180 --> 02:17:31,520
I don't think it looks bad on anyone.

4174
02:17:31,840 --> 02:17:32,960
It's gonna meet the quota.

4175
02:17:32,960 --> 02:17:34,880
We're gonna meet the quota, guys.

4176
02:17:35,780 --> 02:17:36,800
We're meeting the quota.

4177
02:17:36,840 --> 02:17:37,820
We're not gonna be in dead last.

4178
02:17:38,400 --> 02:17:38,800
Yeah.

4179
02:17:41,360 --> 02:17:42,100
What kind of...

4180
02:17:42,100 --> 02:17:42,860
I think it's Macarena.

4181
02:17:43,420 --> 02:17:43,960
What is it?

4182
02:17:43,960 --> 02:17:44,540
Just Dance?

4183
02:17:45,360 --> 02:17:45,760
Yeah.

4184
02:17:45,780 --> 02:17:46,600
I think it's just Dance.

4185
02:17:48,300 --> 02:17:49,380
Oh, my God.

4186
02:17:49,800 --> 02:17:52,440
Why don't we just get to Vibe here and just do all these emotes?

4187
02:17:52,600 --> 02:17:52,740
Yeah.

4188
02:17:52,760 --> 02:17:54,380
Everybody else is, like, fucking...

4189
02:17:55,560 --> 02:17:56,600
Like, strategizing now.

4190
02:17:56,860 --> 02:17:57,900
I know my place.

4191
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:01,640
Oh, there's Chewbacca.

4192
02:18:02,940 --> 02:18:03,880
Wait, you have Chewbacca?

4193
02:18:04,140 --> 02:18:05,460
No, I can buy Chewbacca.

4194
02:18:06,660 --> 02:18:07,580
Wait, what do you have?

4195
02:18:07,580 --> 02:18:08,280
Do you have Han...

4196
02:18:08,280 --> 02:18:09,720
Do you have, like, Han Solo?

4197
02:18:10,720 --> 02:18:16,780
I think out of all the Fortnite skin collabs I have, I don't think I have any ones from Star Wars.

4198
02:18:17,080 --> 02:18:17,780
You don't have...

4199
02:18:17,780 --> 02:18:18,980
Oh, you don't have some...

4200
02:18:18,980 --> 02:18:19,280
Let me see.

4201
02:18:19,560 --> 02:18:19,960
Yeah.

4202
02:18:20,020 --> 02:18:22,220
Guys, it's Lego, but it includes Chewbacca.

4203
02:18:22,520 --> 02:18:23,260
Oh, no, I do.

4204
02:18:23,340 --> 02:18:24,540
I have, like, Darth Vader and stuff.

4205
02:18:24,860 --> 02:18:25,340
And then I have, like...

4206
02:18:25,340 --> 02:18:25,560
No!

4207
02:18:25,600 --> 02:18:27,040
You don't have Han Solo.

4208
02:18:27,860 --> 02:18:29,760
I have a Clone Trooper.

4209
02:18:30,780 --> 02:18:32,760
I have Ahsoka.

4210
02:18:33,400 --> 02:18:34,820
And then I have...

4211
02:18:35,320 --> 02:18:37,660
No, we can't match because you don't have Han Solo.

4212
02:18:38,240 --> 02:18:38,680
Is that it?

4213
02:18:38,680 --> 02:18:38,700
No!

4214
02:18:38,860 --> 02:18:39,860
Oh, do you have Princess Leia?

4215
02:18:40,040 --> 02:18:40,140
No.

4216
02:18:40,360 --> 02:18:41,300
No, I don't.

4217
02:18:41,300 --> 02:18:41,760
I don't...

4218
02:18:41,760 --> 02:18:43,780
Because you can buy Chewbacca right now.

4219
02:18:44,400 --> 02:18:45,140
Oh, wait.

4220
02:18:45,180 --> 02:18:45,420
What?

4221
02:18:45,540 --> 02:18:45,740
What?

4222
02:18:45,760 --> 02:18:47,020
Oh, they added Chewbacca?

4223
02:18:47,020 --> 02:18:48,240
Yeah, they added Chewbacca.

4224
02:18:48,400 --> 02:18:50,060
You have to buy the Lego Pass, though.

4225
02:18:50,740 --> 02:18:51,760
Oh, that's where it's at.

4226
02:18:51,880 --> 02:18:52,040
Okay.

4227
02:18:52,140 --> 02:18:52,720
It's in the Lego Pass.

4228
02:18:52,740 --> 02:18:52,800
Yeah.

4229
02:18:52,800 --> 02:18:54,740
But you can, like, get it Chewbacca regularly.

4230
02:18:56,700 --> 02:18:58,740
Oh, I forgot to put on a back bling.

4231
02:18:58,820 --> 02:18:59,220
I'm sad.

4232
02:18:59,680 --> 02:19:00,240
It's okay.

4233
02:19:00,380 --> 02:19:00,740
I'm naked.

4234
02:19:00,740 --> 02:19:01,360
I'm naked on my back.

4235
02:19:01,420 --> 02:19:03,940
Look at all these condom people.

4236
02:19:04,380 --> 02:19:08,000
Is there any non-condom players in the lobby right now?

4237
02:19:08,920 --> 02:19:09,500
All right.

4238
02:19:09,500 --> 02:19:09,660
Cool.

4239
02:19:09,720 --> 02:19:10,280
We got our spot.

4240
02:19:11,340 --> 02:19:11,840
Oh, we're landing.

4241
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:13,040
We can actually drop right away.

4242
02:19:13,780 --> 02:19:14,180
Okay.

4243
02:19:15,760 --> 02:19:16,120
Let's go.

4244
02:19:17,040 --> 02:19:17,780
All right, Chad.

4245
02:19:17,820 --> 02:19:18,780
Game number six.

4246
02:19:18,800 --> 02:19:19,900
Let's fucking go.

4247
02:19:20,120 --> 02:19:20,280
Wait.

4248
02:19:20,300 --> 02:19:20,980
Is it game number six?

4249
02:19:21,060 --> 02:19:21,720
I thought it was game five.

4250
02:19:21,720 --> 02:19:22,120
I think so.

4251
02:19:22,120 --> 02:19:22,640
Is it game five?

4252
02:19:22,740 --> 02:19:23,160
Is it game five?

4253
02:19:23,180 --> 02:19:23,660
No, it's five.

4254
02:19:24,580 --> 02:19:24,980
Okay.

4255
02:19:24,980 --> 02:19:25,740
Game number five.

4256
02:19:25,740 --> 02:19:26,240
Let's go.

4257
02:19:26,300 --> 02:19:26,320
Let's go.

4258
02:19:27,800 --> 02:19:29,400
Summon the fucking dragon.

4259
02:19:30,700 --> 02:19:31,100
Wee.

4260
02:19:35,340 --> 02:19:36,520
Slowly drifting down.

4261
02:19:40,190 --> 02:19:40,870
All right.

4262
02:19:40,870 --> 02:19:41,210
Oh, nice.

4263
02:19:41,270 --> 02:19:42,350
I got crash pads.

4264
02:19:42,750 --> 02:19:44,050
Oh, that's good.

4265
02:19:46,010 --> 02:19:46,510
All right.

4266
02:19:46,510 --> 02:19:47,130
What's in here?

4267
02:19:47,310 --> 02:19:47,590
Oh.

4268
02:19:47,610 --> 02:19:48,410
A shotgun.

4269
02:19:49,290 --> 02:19:50,570
I got a shotgun.

4270
02:19:53,990 --> 02:19:54,650
Let's see.

4271
02:19:54,850 --> 02:19:55,650
They're all guns.

4272
02:19:55,690 --> 02:19:58,190
The moment I stop being Mr. Beast, there's no more trees.

4273
02:19:59,150 --> 02:20:00,030
It says a lot.

4274
02:20:00,030 --> 02:20:00,430
What the hell?

4275
02:20:00,590 --> 02:20:01,070
Trees?

4276
02:20:01,070 --> 02:20:02,150
It's actually crazy.

4277
02:20:02,490 --> 02:20:04,050
The trees just stop spawning.

4278
02:20:04,670 --> 02:20:05,910
I actually have zero trees.

4279
02:20:05,910 --> 02:20:06,730
Because we are the trees.

4280
02:20:07,470 --> 02:20:09,830
Well, we are the plant, I mean, or the food.

4281
02:20:10,190 --> 02:20:11,150
We're the vegetables.

4282
02:20:12,150 --> 02:20:12,630
Oh, my God.

4283
02:20:12,630 --> 02:20:14,070
It actually stops spawning.

4284
02:20:14,790 --> 02:20:15,790
The game knows.

4285
02:20:17,470 --> 02:20:18,450
Oh, hey, a sniper.

4286
02:20:18,730 --> 02:20:19,150
Oh, hey, a sniper.

4287
02:20:22,490 --> 02:20:23,550
I'm outside your building.

4288
02:20:24,190 --> 02:20:24,550
Okay.

4289
02:20:24,730 --> 02:20:25,630
I'm trying to see what I'm...

4290
02:20:25,630 --> 02:20:26,230
Oh, there's one more.

4291
02:20:26,770 --> 02:20:27,850
Oh, there's a tree here.

4292
02:20:28,410 --> 02:20:29,010
Oh, my God.

4293
02:20:29,070 --> 02:20:29,570
One tree.

4294
02:20:30,070 --> 02:20:30,430
Yeah.

4295
02:20:30,490 --> 02:20:30,930
One tree.

4296
02:20:31,010 --> 02:20:31,650
We got one tree.

4297
02:20:32,470 --> 02:20:33,350
That's all we needed.

4298
02:20:35,210 --> 02:20:37,290
Oh, I got more Gibby bubbles.

4299
02:20:37,950 --> 02:20:38,310
Nice.

4300
02:20:38,310 --> 02:20:38,930
We need that.

4301
02:20:40,730 --> 02:20:41,850
I'm going to drink my shield.

4302
02:20:43,030 --> 02:20:43,490
All right.

4303
02:20:43,510 --> 02:20:46,190
I'm going to see if there's any shields over here.

4304
02:20:46,330 --> 02:20:47,430
Oh, we're also in zone two.

4305
02:20:47,530 --> 02:20:47,750
We're...

4306
02:20:47,750 --> 02:20:48,210
Yay.

4307
02:20:48,210 --> 02:20:48,750
I'm doing good.

4308
02:20:48,810 --> 02:20:49,130
All right.

4309
02:20:49,150 --> 02:20:49,270
Yay.

4310
02:20:50,230 --> 02:20:50,590
Okay.

4311
02:20:50,670 --> 02:20:52,970
I feel like I might not be able to snipe here.

4312
02:20:53,670 --> 02:20:54,790
Everybody's always close range.

4313
02:20:55,810 --> 02:20:56,170
Yeah.

4314
02:20:56,650 --> 02:21:01,750
I've been thinking about what I'm going to run, and I think I'm going to swap up my weapon.

4315
02:21:01,810 --> 02:21:02,950
I have the crash pad.

4316
02:21:03,770 --> 02:21:04,210
Oh, you do?

4317
02:21:04,310 --> 02:21:04,670
Oh, same.

4318
02:21:04,770 --> 02:21:04,930
Same.

4319
02:21:05,050 --> 02:21:05,090
I have six.

4320
02:21:06,110 --> 02:21:06,470
Okay.

4321
02:21:06,510 --> 02:21:07,930
I'm just grabbing stuff over here.

4322
02:21:07,950 --> 02:21:08,470
I'm coming back.

4323
02:21:09,330 --> 02:21:11,110
We just don't have the porta potty.

4324
02:21:13,470 --> 02:21:14,690
We're just missing the...

4325
02:21:14,690 --> 02:21:15,990
How are we going to build a house?

4326
02:21:16,470 --> 02:21:17,990
I have four Gibby bubbles.

4327
02:21:17,990 --> 02:21:22,410
I have six launch pads and two shock waves.

4328
02:21:23,010 --> 02:21:23,770
You know what?

4329
02:21:23,910 --> 02:21:24,250
Oh, sweet.

4330
02:21:24,350 --> 02:21:24,630
Okay.

4331
02:21:24,750 --> 02:21:24,890
Okay.

4332
02:21:24,990 --> 02:21:25,770
Day, look at...

4333
02:21:25,770 --> 02:21:26,950
You're a shock wave master now.

4334
02:21:27,110 --> 02:21:27,630
And trees.

4335
02:21:28,590 --> 02:21:29,230
And trees?

4336
02:21:29,410 --> 02:21:29,610
Okay.

4337
02:21:29,670 --> 02:21:30,070
Yeah.

4338
02:21:31,090 --> 02:21:33,470
Oh, I got houses.

4339
02:21:34,810 --> 02:21:35,830
We got a house?

4340
02:21:36,010 --> 02:21:37,250
We can afford it.

4341
02:21:37,890 --> 02:21:38,370
All right.

4342
02:21:38,390 --> 02:21:39,050
I'm going back to you.

4343
02:21:39,290 --> 02:21:40,110
Oh, my God.

4344
02:21:41,210 --> 02:21:41,630
Guys.

4345
02:21:42,990 --> 02:21:44,390
We are going to make it.

4346
02:21:45,050 --> 02:21:45,870
We have a house.

4347
02:21:45,870 --> 02:21:47,690
I think we have to just chill here for a little bit.

4348
02:21:47,710 --> 02:21:47,970
Yeah.

4349
02:21:47,970 --> 02:21:49,290
Oh, you know what we can also do too?

4350
02:21:49,430 --> 02:21:50,250
Were there med kits here?

4351
02:21:51,130 --> 02:21:53,330
There were like bandages, but not a med kit.

4352
02:21:53,630 --> 02:21:55,370
We might be able to lift Storm again.

4353
02:21:55,490 --> 02:21:56,430
We can do that strat.

4354
02:21:56,550 --> 02:21:57,790
Remember how that team was living forever?

4355
02:21:58,210 --> 02:21:58,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4356
02:21:58,430 --> 02:21:59,790
I'm going to try that.

4357
02:21:59,950 --> 02:22:00,430
I'm going to try that.

4358
02:22:00,510 --> 02:22:01,250
Did you grab the bandages?

4359
02:22:01,470 --> 02:22:01,970
Because there was...

4360
02:22:03,510 --> 02:22:03,870
No.

4361
02:22:04,010 --> 02:22:04,810
Let me check up here.

4362
02:22:05,150 --> 02:22:06,290
I know I dropped some.

4363
02:22:07,390 --> 02:22:11,510
We also have a lot of space to work with, and we can go all the way over there too.

4364
02:22:12,350 --> 02:22:12,710
But...

4365
02:22:13,690 --> 02:22:14,810
Oh, what do I drop?

4366
02:22:14,810 --> 02:22:15,370
There's a butt?

4367
02:22:15,950 --> 02:22:16,970
Do you want to...

4368
02:22:16,970 --> 02:22:17,530
I don't know.

4369
02:22:17,590 --> 02:22:17,950
I don't know.

4370
02:22:19,010 --> 02:22:19,450
Butts?

4371
02:22:19,450 --> 02:22:19,650
Ayo?

4372
02:22:21,850 --> 02:22:24,490
Do you want to build houses or do you want to make Gibby bubbles?

4373
02:22:25,830 --> 02:22:27,770
I feel like the house is stronger.

4374
02:22:28,050 --> 02:22:35,170
When I saw like 200,000 houses and like two Gibby bubbles, I feel like people were running houses more.

4375
02:22:35,510 --> 02:22:38,490
I'm going to drop the houses and I'm going to try to find some heals.

4376
02:22:39,770 --> 02:22:41,270
Because we also have to move too.

4377
02:22:41,490 --> 02:22:42,850
But we can also move with Storm.

4378
02:22:42,970 --> 02:22:47,010
We're going to like eat Storm because it's pretty fun.

4379
02:22:47,010 --> 02:22:47,530
Wait.

4380
02:22:47,690 --> 02:22:49,190
You're not going to pick up the bunker?

4381
02:22:49,730 --> 02:22:50,010
Or...

4382
02:22:50,010 --> 02:22:50,290
Oh, yeah.

4383
02:22:50,750 --> 02:22:51,570
I can pick it up for now.

4384
02:22:51,670 --> 02:22:51,790
Yeah.

4385
02:22:51,850 --> 02:22:56,430
Because like I'm going to try to find us med kits and heals, but we're going to go slow with Storm.

4386
02:22:56,510 --> 02:22:57,270
We're going to go at like 10 seconds.

4387
02:22:57,630 --> 02:22:57,650
Okay.

4388
02:23:01,920 --> 02:23:06,460
I don't think that team's going to come over from where we've died before.

4389
02:23:07,860 --> 02:23:10,460
Knowing them, I think they're going to rotate like all the way in the south.

4390
02:23:10,560 --> 02:23:11,820
So I think...

4391
02:23:13,540 --> 02:23:13,820
Yeah.

4392
02:23:13,820 --> 02:23:14,980
We're going to try to go back to looping.

4393
02:23:15,280 --> 02:23:15,560
Okay.

4394
02:23:15,720 --> 02:23:16,060
All right.

4395
02:23:16,060 --> 02:23:16,460
Let's start going.

4396
02:23:16,900 --> 02:23:17,220
All right.

4397
02:23:17,220 --> 02:23:17,900
Let's go.

4398
02:23:18,320 --> 02:23:19,080
Team veggies.

4399
02:23:19,480 --> 02:23:22,620
See, I see a team on the island, but we're going to go with Storm.

4400
02:23:23,580 --> 02:23:24,360
Team veggies.

4401
02:23:25,720 --> 02:23:26,160
Okay.

4402
02:23:26,540 --> 02:23:27,840
Let's see.

4403
02:23:28,180 --> 02:23:28,960
Oh, there's team on right.

4404
02:23:29,080 --> 02:23:29,500
Let's crouch.

4405
02:23:29,640 --> 02:23:29,820
Crouch.

4406
02:23:31,280 --> 02:23:32,140
We're going to chill here.

4407
02:23:33,560 --> 02:23:34,740
Please leave us alone.

4408
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:36,480
We're just poor little veggies.

4409
02:23:38,160 --> 02:23:39,900
We're trying to save the environment.

4410
02:23:41,080 --> 02:23:44,100
I also have a lot of jump pads, so that way we can keep rotating.

4411
02:23:44,520 --> 02:23:45,040
Not last.

4412
02:23:46,020 --> 02:23:46,460
Yay.

4413
02:23:46,760 --> 02:23:47,200
All right.

4414
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:50,580
And this is going to be harder.

4415
02:23:50,580 --> 02:23:50,600
Let's go all the way out here.

4416
02:23:50,600 --> 02:23:50,880
You know that man.

4417
02:23:52,240 --> 02:23:52,560
Um.

4418
02:23:54,720 --> 02:23:55,440
How much gold?

4419
02:23:55,480 --> 02:23:56,420
I only got nine gold.

4420
02:23:57,820 --> 02:23:58,980
I have nine as well.

4421
02:24:00,060 --> 02:24:00,380
Okay.

4422
02:24:00,440 --> 02:24:01,140
We're going to hear...

4423
02:24:01,140 --> 02:24:01,780
Let's go in this bush here.

4424
02:24:01,840 --> 02:24:02,340
Come up here.

4425
02:24:02,400 --> 02:24:02,700
Okay.

4426
02:24:03,620 --> 02:24:05,520
We're going to look around.

4427
02:24:05,640 --> 02:24:05,860
Oh yeah.

4428
02:24:05,900 --> 02:24:07,000
There's definitely still team on the island.

4429
02:24:07,120 --> 02:24:07,540
So this is good.

4430
02:24:07,620 --> 02:24:07,980
This is good.

4431
02:24:08,500 --> 02:24:09,800
I don't have any meds.

4432
02:24:10,920 --> 02:24:12,780
We're going to find meds to the left.

4433
02:24:12,840 --> 02:24:14,400
We're going to go all the way over here.

4434
02:24:14,620 --> 02:24:15,440
What if we don't?

4435
02:24:16,060 --> 02:24:18,140
If we don't, uh, GG.

4436
02:24:19,060 --> 02:24:22,260
Cause like, your plan relies very heavily on the meds part.

4437
02:24:23,560 --> 02:24:25,140
This guy is also healing.

4438
02:24:25,320 --> 02:24:26,300
Oh no, what are they doing?

4439
02:24:26,480 --> 02:24:27,200
I think we're good.

4440
02:24:27,360 --> 02:24:28,060
Okay, let's go left.

4441
02:24:30,920 --> 02:24:32,900
I'm a little concerned, because woo!

4442
02:24:33,560 --> 02:24:34,240
I fell down.

4443
02:24:34,240 --> 02:24:36,760
I'm pretty sure I did find meds here earlier.

4444
02:24:36,780 --> 02:24:37,120
I fell down.

4445
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:37,820
I'm pretty sure.

4446
02:24:37,900 --> 02:24:38,280
Oh, you fell?

4447
02:24:38,700 --> 02:24:39,660
Oh, here, I got a crossbow.

4448
02:24:39,800 --> 02:24:40,240
Here you go.

4449
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:42,980
I think that should work?

4450
02:24:42,980 --> 02:24:43,320
Does it work?

4451
02:24:43,340 --> 02:24:43,700
No.

4452
02:24:45,700 --> 02:24:46,060
Goodbye.

4453
02:24:47,020 --> 02:24:48,480
Oh, here, I'll toss you a mickey.

4454
02:24:48,500 --> 02:24:48,980
I'm gonna toss you a mickey.

4455
02:24:49,080 --> 02:24:49,260
Goodbye.

4456
02:24:50,700 --> 02:24:51,060
Yay!

4457
02:24:52,820 --> 02:24:56,780
Wait, do you have enough heals, though?

4458
02:24:57,260 --> 02:24:58,760
No, I can find something, though.

4459
02:24:58,800 --> 02:24:59,340
I'll find something.

4460
02:24:59,540 --> 02:25:04,140
Cause there is, uh, a bunch of chests up here.

4461
02:25:05,480 --> 02:25:06,800
Oh, I got splashes.

4462
02:25:06,800 --> 02:25:07,220
Yeah, we're good.

4463
02:25:07,340 --> 02:25:07,700
Nice!

4464
02:25:07,780 --> 02:25:08,580
I'm gonna light a campfire.

4465
02:25:12,110 --> 02:25:13,810
And then I got more splashes.

4466
02:25:13,870 --> 02:25:14,910
Oh, there's more bandages!

4467
02:25:15,250 --> 02:25:17,670
Alright, so I'm gonna splashes once this thing goes out.

4468
02:25:17,770 --> 02:25:18,030
Alright.

4469
02:25:18,690 --> 02:25:20,950
Cause if I splashes now, it goes away.

4470
02:25:21,290 --> 02:25:22,090
Oh no.

4471
02:25:22,750 --> 02:25:24,350
We can live here forever.

4472
02:25:25,250 --> 02:25:27,070
This is our new home now.

4473
02:25:27,750 --> 02:25:30,650
We're drinking some, uh, some grape juice.

4474
02:25:36,950 --> 02:25:38,070
There's nobody here.

4475
02:25:38,230 --> 02:25:39,210
I can even... Oh!

4476
02:25:39,210 --> 02:25:42,010
Oh, what the fuck?

4477
02:25:42,470 --> 02:25:43,210
I cracked him!

4478
02:25:43,330 --> 02:25:44,070
I knocked him!

4479
02:25:44,730 --> 02:25:45,310
I knocked him!

4480
02:25:45,410 --> 02:25:45,650
I knocked him!

4481
02:25:45,710 --> 02:25:45,890
I knocked him!

4482
02:25:46,010 --> 02:25:46,010
I knocked him!

4483
02:25:46,650 --> 02:25:47,630
Okay, I'm gonna push.

4484
02:25:47,630 --> 02:25:48,150
I'm gonna push that.

4485
02:25:48,270 --> 02:25:48,950
He died.

4486
02:25:49,030 --> 02:25:49,270
He died.

4487
02:25:49,310 --> 02:25:49,430
He died.

4488
02:25:49,450 --> 02:25:50,030
Okay, let's go left.

4489
02:25:50,090 --> 02:25:50,410
Let's go left.

4490
02:25:50,450 --> 02:25:50,790
Let's go left.

4491
02:25:55,270 --> 02:25:55,990
Oh, shit!

4492
02:25:56,750 --> 02:25:57,350
Oh, god!

4493
02:25:57,910 --> 02:25:59,430
I'm freaking freaked out!

4494
02:26:00,010 --> 02:26:03,390
I was like, where did he come from?

4495
02:26:03,390 --> 02:26:04,850
Where the fuck?

4496
02:26:06,130 --> 02:26:08,530
That was actually so fucking terrifying.

4497
02:26:08,730 --> 02:26:11,530
I was literally, I was literally trying to jam out!

4498
02:26:12,010 --> 02:26:12,930
I was literally, I was literally trying to jam out!

4499
02:26:15,150 --> 02:26:16,050
Holy shit.

4500
02:26:16,610 --> 02:26:17,850
Oh my god.

4501
02:26:18,050 --> 02:26:19,370
Oh my god.

4502
02:26:19,370 --> 02:26:19,850
Oh my god, Yogi.

4503
02:26:19,930 --> 02:26:21,250
That was fucking terrifying.

4504
02:26:21,290 --> 02:26:22,330
That was so funny.

4505
02:26:22,590 --> 02:26:22,910
Holy shit.

4506
02:26:23,610 --> 02:26:26,870
At that moment, I was like, there's nobody here.

4507
02:26:26,890 --> 02:26:30,530
I can finally emote and I see a guy next to me.

4508
02:26:30,530 --> 02:26:33,770
I'm chilling in Iva and this dude's running up like, yo, word?

4509
02:26:36,470 --> 02:26:37,950
I think we're good here.

4510
02:26:38,110 --> 02:26:38,850
I think we're good here.

4511
02:26:38,990 --> 02:26:39,350
I think.

4512
02:26:39,530 --> 02:26:40,950
There's a bunch of here I want us to get to.

4513
02:26:41,750 --> 02:26:43,150
Okay, I'm trying to head there.

4514
02:26:43,310 --> 02:26:44,130
I don't know if I can...

4515
02:26:44,130 --> 02:26:45,270
Oh, I fucking have a crown.

4516
02:26:45,370 --> 02:26:45,950
I'm so dumb.

4517
02:26:46,250 --> 02:26:47,270
Oh my god, again?

4518
02:26:47,970 --> 02:26:49,790
It keeps on respawning it on us.

4519
02:26:50,030 --> 02:26:51,550
Yeah, you have to, what's the word?

4520
02:26:51,610 --> 02:26:52,730
You have to, like, drop it, right?

4521
02:26:53,390 --> 02:26:56,770
Yeah, if I drop it though, people are gonna see it on the map, so I'm just gonna chill here.

4522
02:26:57,570 --> 02:26:58,370
Okay, I'm good.

4523
02:26:58,410 --> 02:26:58,790
I'm good here.

4524
02:26:58,890 --> 02:26:59,250
This is where he is?

4525
02:26:59,750 --> 02:27:00,070
What?

4526
02:27:00,210 --> 02:27:00,510
Um...

4527
02:27:00,530 --> 02:27:02,750
I'm gonna look around for him.

4528
02:27:03,630 --> 02:27:04,650
I'm in the bush.

4529
02:27:05,090 --> 02:27:07,650
I feel like there's gonna be a team on top of the tower here.

4530
02:27:07,850 --> 02:27:09,270
Not if I'm in the bush.

4531
02:27:09,810 --> 02:27:10,290
Hmm.

4532
02:27:14,360 --> 02:27:15,320
I'm terrified!

4533
02:27:15,620 --> 02:27:16,980
I don't know if there's heals here.

4534
02:27:17,180 --> 02:27:18,180
I'm so scared.

4535
02:27:19,040 --> 02:27:21,900
Dude, this buck MPS died like four times!

4536
02:27:22,020 --> 02:27:22,520
It won!

4537
02:27:22,760 --> 02:27:26,020
I didn't see him die like four times in this game!

4538
02:27:26,560 --> 02:27:29,220
Okay, Goki, I'm gonna try... we have to move forward.

4539
02:27:29,340 --> 02:27:29,800
Okay.

4540
02:27:29,800 --> 02:27:31,460
So, we can try to get over here?

4541
02:27:31,680 --> 02:27:32,160
Okay.

4542
02:27:32,180 --> 02:27:34,560
Or we can get to here and build a house together.

4543
02:27:34,940 --> 02:27:36,400
Okay, I believe in the house.

4544
02:27:36,500 --> 02:27:37,460
I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go.

4545
02:27:37,560 --> 02:27:40,640
I'm gonna actually burn a bubble on this, because I need to see if there's heals on here.

4546
02:27:44,840 --> 02:27:45,220
Heals?

4547
02:27:46,540 --> 02:27:47,440
There's no heals.

4548
02:27:47,600 --> 02:27:48,640
No, oh no.

4549
02:27:50,100 --> 02:27:51,420
Okay, I'm going to your bush.

4550
02:27:52,140 --> 02:27:53,600
Actually, we go here.

4551
02:27:54,680 --> 02:27:55,780
Trying to ping what's in.

4552
02:27:57,280 --> 02:27:58,580
Someone is getting closer.

4553
02:27:59,220 --> 02:28:01,600
Is someone- I see the blueberry juice coming in.

4554
02:28:01,660 --> 02:28:03,000
Let's go this bush, let's go this bush.

4555
02:28:06,140 --> 02:28:07,600
Oh no, oh no.

4556
02:28:07,760 --> 02:28:09,940
Oh, there you go.

4557
02:28:10,600 --> 02:28:11,260
We're good.

4558
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:12,600
I'm looking.

4559
02:28:12,740 --> 02:28:13,620
Wait, where did they shoot you from?

4560
02:28:13,780 --> 02:28:14,340
Over here?

4561
02:28:16,620 --> 02:28:17,340
I'm gonna go behind.

4562
02:28:18,540 --> 02:28:19,120
I'm okay.

4563
02:28:19,600 --> 02:28:20,740
Oh, are they in the bush?

4564
02:28:20,820 --> 02:28:22,060
I think they might be in the bush over here.

4565
02:28:23,060 --> 02:28:23,840
Where is here?

4566
02:28:24,660 --> 02:28:26,540
Uh, let's see if I can ping it.

4567
02:28:27,440 --> 02:28:28,340
Right there, I think?

4568
02:28:28,700 --> 02:28:30,700
Oh my god, oh my god.

4569
02:28:30,740 --> 02:28:31,420
Yeah, they are, they are, they are.

4570
02:28:34,820 --> 02:28:35,540
Where are they?

4571
02:28:35,680 --> 02:28:37,820
I'm gonna, they're, they're like hiding in there.

4572
02:28:37,960 --> 02:28:39,280
In that bush in front of us?

4573
02:28:39,300 --> 02:28:40,540
Yeah, they're literally in that bush.

4574
02:28:41,160 --> 02:28:42,140
What the fuck is wrong with them?

4575
02:28:42,140 --> 02:28:42,840
I, I wrapped all the way around.

4576
02:28:44,900 --> 02:28:46,320
Wait, where did you go?

4577
02:28:46,940 --> 02:28:48,260
I'm uh, behind you, I'm behind you.

4578
02:28:48,660 --> 02:28:49,460
Oh, there you are.

4579
02:28:50,900 --> 02:28:53,380
Okay, we can keep- Oh, actually, Goki, I have an idea.

4580
02:28:53,540 --> 02:28:54,300
Here, run back to me.

4581
02:28:54,620 --> 02:28:54,980
Yeah?

4582
02:28:55,100 --> 02:28:57,280
And we're gonna cut all the way to this on that.

4583
02:28:57,700 --> 02:28:59,460
Okay, I'm gonna toss a little jump pad.

4584
02:28:59,600 --> 02:29:00,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4585
02:29:00,220 --> 02:29:01,360
Get ready and let's go.

4586
02:29:02,120 --> 02:29:04,240
Oh, I'm being fucking- You missed it, you missed it!

4587
02:29:04,240 --> 02:29:05,580
No, it's bugging me!

4588
02:29:05,740 --> 02:29:06,520
It's bugging me!

4589
02:29:06,640 --> 02:29:08,020
Okay, just keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going.

4590
02:29:08,560 --> 02:29:09,220
There we go.

4591
02:29:09,340 --> 02:29:10,180
Oh my god.

4592
02:29:10,940 --> 02:29:11,620
This game.

4593
02:29:12,580 --> 02:29:13,220
This game.

4594
02:29:14,660 --> 02:29:17,040
I'm going- Oh my god, it's bugging again!

4595
02:29:17,160 --> 02:29:18,160
I hate it here, dude!

4596
02:29:20,260 --> 02:29:20,800
I'm okay.

4597
02:29:20,940 --> 02:29:21,840
I feel safe.

4598
02:29:22,040 --> 02:29:23,060
Oh, I see them, I see them.

4599
02:29:23,180 --> 02:29:23,500
I'm okay.

4600
02:29:23,600 --> 02:29:24,080
Okay, I'm coming over.

4601
02:29:24,180 --> 02:29:24,540
I'm okay.

4602
02:29:24,760 --> 02:29:25,980
I found bandages.

4603
02:29:25,980 --> 02:29:26,200
I'm here.

4604
02:29:26,380 --> 02:29:27,840
I found bandages.

4605
02:29:27,960 --> 02:29:29,320
I'm gonna toss this down.

4606
02:29:31,260 --> 02:29:32,240
It's okay, I'm here.

4607
02:29:34,240 --> 02:29:36,380
I launchpad like two times to get here.

4608
02:29:37,620 --> 02:29:38,980
All right, we're covered on both sides.

4609
02:29:39,080 --> 02:29:39,600
We're good, we're good.

4610
02:29:39,680 --> 02:29:39,840
Okay.

4611
02:29:41,140 --> 02:29:42,340
I feel safer.

4612
02:29:44,880 --> 02:29:47,700
I'm just watching the other team behind us.

4613
02:29:49,100 --> 02:29:49,900
Holy shit.

4614
02:29:51,020 --> 02:29:53,060
Where is this RPG coming from?

4615
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:54,920
Wait, is that an RPG?

4616
02:29:55,440 --> 02:29:55,840
Yeah.

4617
02:29:56,520 --> 02:29:57,700
Oh, I think I know where.

4618
02:29:57,860 --> 02:29:58,700
It's uh, I'll ping it.

4619
02:29:58,840 --> 02:29:59,780
I think it's right there.

4620
02:30:01,360 --> 02:30:02,920
I hear like- Vroom vroom.

4621
02:30:03,360 --> 02:30:03,880
Vroom vroom.

4622
02:30:04,080 --> 02:30:04,220
Vroom vroom.

4623
02:30:04,660 --> 02:30:07,980
Doki, if we get pushed, I'm gonna immediately just shield bubble.

4624
02:30:08,120 --> 02:30:09,460
I'm gonna give you bubble.

4625
02:30:09,960 --> 02:30:10,420
Okay, okay.

4626
02:30:10,780 --> 02:30:13,280
I'm like, should I like come to you or be in this house?

4627
02:30:13,460 --> 02:30:14,500
No, no, you're good on that side.

4628
02:30:14,560 --> 02:30:14,980
You're good on that side.

4629
02:30:17,040 --> 02:30:17,500
All right.

4630
02:30:17,620 --> 02:30:18,800
Oh, oh, that's you.

4631
02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:19,640
Okay, I was like, who's that?

4632
02:30:19,840 --> 02:30:22,780
Yeah, I see a team that's fighting over here.

4633
02:30:23,720 --> 02:30:25,820
Wait, there's like a shield potion right in front of me.

4634
02:30:26,240 --> 02:30:26,800
Oh, there is?

4635
02:30:26,940 --> 02:30:27,400
Oh, that's good.

4636
02:30:27,700 --> 02:30:28,880
Okay, yeah, you can pop that then.

4637
02:30:28,920 --> 02:30:29,820
Okay, I'm gonna...

4638
02:30:33,180 --> 02:30:33,500
Yay!

4639
02:30:35,240 --> 02:30:36,620
I should probably not peek that.

4640
02:30:39,300 --> 02:30:42,160
They're fighting to our side?

4641
02:30:44,020 --> 02:30:45,160
I don't have an angle.

4642
02:30:46,860 --> 02:30:49,880
You can feel free to shoot whoever just so that way we have presence.

4643
02:30:50,180 --> 02:30:50,320
What's that sound?

4644
02:30:52,020 --> 02:30:53,820
Oh, that's uh, people responding, I think.

4645
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:55,980
Oh, oh, the respawn's ending.

4646
02:30:56,120 --> 02:30:57,340
Okay, I was like, what the fuck?

4647
02:30:57,360 --> 02:30:58,600
Oh, we're like, we're good here.

4648
02:30:58,740 --> 02:30:59,560
We're literally chilling.

4649
02:30:59,700 --> 02:31:01,440
Yeah, I feel, I feel a little safer now.

4650
02:31:01,620 --> 02:31:02,140
We're chilling.

4651
02:31:02,780 --> 02:31:04,020
Oh, there's people in front of us.

4652
02:31:04,940 --> 02:31:06,060
Oops, I shot my house.

4653
02:31:09,640 --> 02:31:10,560
Oh, I hit that.

4654
02:31:11,380 --> 02:31:13,080
I randomly griefed this guy.

4655
02:31:14,120 --> 02:31:15,120
77 on someone?

4656
02:31:15,720 --> 02:31:17,860
Don't you love just griefing people in VR?

4657
02:31:20,700 --> 02:31:22,060
Is it safe for me to go up here?

4658
02:31:22,100 --> 02:31:22,460
I'm terrified.

4659
02:31:22,580 --> 02:31:23,300
I could get shot from there.

4660
02:31:23,440 --> 02:31:24,660
Yeah, I know.

4661
02:31:24,800 --> 02:31:25,580
It's so terrifying.

4662
02:31:26,980 --> 02:31:28,220
Um, can I peek this?

4663
02:31:30,320 --> 02:31:31,760
Oh, I can't even peek on the right.

4664
02:31:33,220 --> 02:31:34,000
There's so many people.

4665
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:34,660
There's so many gunshots.

4666
02:31:38,040 --> 02:31:40,300
Come on, come out of the house, please.

4667
02:31:40,400 --> 02:31:44,020
If this bunker is safe, I'm going to...

4668
02:31:44,020 --> 02:31:44,960
Oh yeah, there were people here.

4669
02:31:46,720 --> 02:31:48,140
There's people gonna be right here on the left.

4670
02:31:48,340 --> 02:31:48,700
Okay.

4671
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:51,580
I don't have an angle on that.

4672
02:31:52,040 --> 02:31:52,780
Yeah, you're good.

4673
02:31:52,840 --> 02:31:53,040
You're good.

4674
02:31:53,200 --> 02:31:56,680
Yeah, the only thing is she was in front of me and a little bit to the left.

4675
02:31:57,400 --> 02:32:01,660
If you get shot at, I can throw the bubble down where it can connect on your side of the building.

4676
02:32:01,980 --> 02:32:02,340
Yeah.

4677
02:32:02,960 --> 02:32:03,560
But, uh...

4678
02:32:03,560 --> 02:32:03,980
I think I'm fine for now.

4679
02:32:03,980 --> 02:32:05,280
Like, I still have this house.

4680
02:32:05,660 --> 02:32:06,060
Yeah.

4681
02:32:06,960 --> 02:32:08,400
Yeah, we made this house.

4682
02:32:08,420 --> 02:32:08,640
Yeah.

4683
02:32:08,720 --> 02:32:09,340
It's our house.

4684
02:32:09,860 --> 02:32:11,120
Oh, they're coming out of the house.

4685
02:32:11,280 --> 02:32:11,920
Oh wait, never mind.

4686
02:32:12,320 --> 02:32:14,120
Okay, so we are gonna have to move.

4687
02:32:15,420 --> 02:32:16,220
Um, but...

4688
02:32:16,220 --> 02:32:16,680
Okay.

4689
02:32:17,080 --> 02:32:17,620
I think...

4690
02:32:17,620 --> 02:32:19,120
I have one house I can build.

4691
02:32:21,100 --> 02:32:21,620
All right.

4692
02:32:21,680 --> 02:32:24,040
We can try to get over here, I think?

4693
02:32:24,040 --> 02:32:26,160
I feel confident with that one house.

4694
02:32:28,400 --> 02:32:30,440
Actually, Joki, come to this side of the house.

4695
02:32:30,740 --> 02:32:33,280
Because I think what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make a...

4696
02:32:33,980 --> 02:32:34,380
Launch pad?

4697
02:32:34,660 --> 02:32:34,880
Oh!

4698
02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:35,920
Oh!

4699
02:32:36,160 --> 02:32:36,260
Oh!

4700
02:32:37,040 --> 02:32:37,840
Wait, how do I...

4701
02:32:37,840 --> 02:32:39,620
Wait, you go inside the door!

4702
02:32:39,900 --> 02:32:42,280
No, I'm gonna die from this door here!

4703
02:32:42,680 --> 02:32:43,620
There's a door here!

4704
02:32:43,880 --> 02:32:44,500
What the fuck?

4705
02:32:44,640 --> 02:32:45,940
What the fuck, Dorian?

4706
02:32:45,940 --> 02:32:49,020
You didn't tell me to fucking open the door!

4707
02:32:49,740 --> 02:32:50,460
I can't!

4708
02:32:50,560 --> 02:32:52,340
Okay, we're gonna have to go, we're gonna have to go, we're gonna have to go!

4709
02:32:52,740 --> 02:32:53,700
No, we're gonna go!

4710
02:32:54,040 --> 02:32:56,180
I'm gonna die now, Dorian!

4711
02:32:56,300 --> 02:32:57,420
No, you're gonna live, you're gonna live!

4712
02:32:57,680 --> 02:32:58,060
I'm gonna die!

4713
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:00,000
Oh, you're good, you're good!

4714
02:33:01,260 --> 02:33:02,520
I got you, I got you, I got you.

4715
02:33:02,800 --> 02:33:03,160
Ah!

4716
02:33:03,300 --> 02:33:03,560
Ah!

4717
02:33:04,080 --> 02:33:06,260
I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you.

4718
02:33:06,360 --> 02:33:08,780
How did you tell me that the door...

4719
02:33:09,620 --> 02:33:11,460
Alright, so this might be a GG, so I'm dead.

4720
02:33:15,340 --> 02:33:16,580
You just said, go!

4721
02:33:16,820 --> 02:33:18,060
I was like, okay!

4722
02:33:18,280 --> 02:33:19,380
I didn't realize you can't climb!

4723
02:33:19,380 --> 02:33:19,400
No!

4724
02:33:19,400 --> 02:33:21,540
There was a door on the other side!

4725
02:33:22,100 --> 02:33:24,300
I can't tell, there was a door!

4726
02:33:27,530 --> 02:33:29,230
I got so confused!

4727
02:33:29,930 --> 02:33:32,210
I don't know if you can climb.

4728
02:33:33,110 --> 02:33:36,480
I don't know if you can climb.

4729
02:33:36,480 --> 02:33:36,640
I don't know if you can climb.

4730
02:33:57,480 --> 02:34:05,480
My favorite part about that whole scenario is that you could have literally walked inside

4731
02:34:18,520 --> 02:34:26,700
Oh my god, I'm fucking crying right now.

4732
02:34:26,800 --> 02:34:27,880
That was so funny.

4733
02:34:28,240 --> 02:34:30,660
I can't see the door!

4734
02:34:36,490 --> 02:34:37,930
Oh my god.

4735
02:34:38,110 --> 02:34:41,250
I can't realize, I get so scared.

4736
02:34:47,210 --> 02:34:48,610
Oh my god.

4737
02:34:48,970 --> 02:34:50,710
Guys, we gotta kill, guys.

4738
02:34:51,490 --> 02:34:52,990
That's all that matters.

4739
02:34:54,770 --> 02:34:57,150
We got one kill, we ended on 50.

4740
02:34:57,230 --> 02:34:57,530
You know what?

4741
02:34:57,570 --> 02:34:59,290
No, no, Doggy, we have consistency, okay?

4742
02:34:59,290 --> 02:34:59,990
Yeah, we have consistency.

4743
02:34:59,990 --> 02:35:01,150
You know what these things don't have?

4744
02:35:01,170 --> 02:35:02,250
They don't have consistency.

4745
02:35:02,950 --> 02:35:03,510
Exactly.

4746
02:35:03,770 --> 02:35:05,130
We're never last.

4747
02:35:05,130 --> 02:35:07,730
They're not ending on the same number as we are.

4748
02:35:07,890 --> 02:35:09,110
Every single round.

4749
02:35:10,690 --> 02:35:12,890
We're 15th place Andes.

4750
02:35:14,270 --> 02:35:16,450
Oh my god.

4751
02:35:17,010 --> 02:35:19,310
Oh my god, the houses are real.

4752
02:35:19,330 --> 02:35:22,890
I swear, we died to the Christmas team so many times.

4753
02:35:23,590 --> 02:35:26,350
Yeah, they wanna wish us Merry Christmas in July.

4754
02:35:26,770 --> 02:35:27,610
Why are they always next to us?

4755
02:35:29,890 --> 02:35:31,130
I swear, it's like they know.

4756
02:35:31,190 --> 02:35:31,670
They're like...

4757
02:35:31,670 --> 02:35:35,270
Look, these guys are the different people who keep on becoming other skins.

4758
02:35:35,410 --> 02:35:37,090
Yeah, they know.

4759
02:35:38,130 --> 02:35:39,510
They fucking know.

4760
02:35:40,770 --> 02:35:42,930
That was the fucking best one of them, Joe.

4761
02:35:42,970 --> 02:35:43,390
They know that's us.

4762
02:35:47,540 --> 02:35:48,720
Holy shit.

4763
02:35:48,780 --> 02:35:51,920
I'm literally crying, but like, my cheeks hurt from laughing.

4764
02:35:52,120 --> 02:35:53,600
That was so fucking funny.

4765
02:35:53,840 --> 02:35:56,220
I wonder what it looked like on their stream.

4766
02:35:57,580 --> 02:36:00,940
They tried to climb the house and get knocked off.

4767
02:36:00,940 --> 02:36:02,460
Wait, are they alive still?

4768
02:36:02,620 --> 02:36:03,740
Are the Christmas people alive?

4769
02:36:03,860 --> 02:36:04,600
Yeah, they're still alive.

4770
02:36:05,180 --> 02:36:06,180
Wait, who was it?

4771
02:36:06,320 --> 02:36:06,980
Oh, wait, wait, here, here.

4772
02:36:06,980 --> 02:36:07,280
I don't know.

4773
02:36:07,300 --> 02:36:07,820
They're anonymous.

4774
02:36:07,840 --> 02:36:08,260
They're anonymous.

4775
02:36:08,520 --> 02:36:09,320
Yeah, we don't know.

4776
02:36:09,680 --> 02:36:12,060
Oh my god.

4777
02:36:12,120 --> 02:36:14,280
I wanna watch their POVs so bad.

4778
02:36:14,360 --> 02:36:16,940
They're gonna be like, why is this guy running outside?

4779
02:36:17,860 --> 02:36:20,000
I didn't know there was a door.

4780
02:36:22,180 --> 02:36:24,940
Wait, what the fuck?

4781
02:36:24,980 --> 02:36:26,260
He threw a trophy at us.

4782
02:36:26,260 --> 02:36:26,340
What the fuck?

4783
02:36:26,560 --> 02:36:27,080
What the fuck?

4784
02:36:27,720 --> 02:36:29,640
Oh my god, they died in one...

4785
02:36:29,640 --> 02:36:30,320
What?

4786
02:36:30,320 --> 02:36:32,420
They fucking closed my eyes and they're dead.

4787
02:36:33,200 --> 02:36:37,020
That is some OG ass thing I've never ever seen.

4788
02:36:37,060 --> 02:36:38,300
What the... what is that?

4789
02:36:38,820 --> 02:36:40,120
What are they holding?

4790
02:36:42,300 --> 02:36:43,280
What is that?

4791
02:36:43,680 --> 02:36:46,460
Like, they're holding a giant, like, a giant trophy.

4792
02:36:46,780 --> 02:36:47,160
What the fuck?

4793
02:36:47,160 --> 02:36:48,100
And then they, like, throw it?

4794
02:36:49,080 --> 02:36:50,700
I've never seen this before.

4795
02:36:50,880 --> 02:36:52,320
That's how, like, not OG I am.

4796
02:36:52,440 --> 02:36:52,960
Like, what are they doing?

4797
02:36:52,960 --> 02:36:56,020
What are they doing with the trophy?

4798
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:58,260
I think they have one-shots.

4799
02:37:00,320 --> 02:37:03,180
Oh, it does 200 damage in one hit.

4800
02:37:03,600 --> 02:37:04,760
What the fuck?

4801
02:37:04,760 --> 02:37:05,720
How did you get the trophy?

4802
02:37:07,020 --> 02:37:08,660
BuckFPS is still alive?

4803
02:37:09,360 --> 02:37:14,600
This man has died, like, this is the fifth time I see him die on the kill feed.

4804
02:37:14,860 --> 02:37:16,600
How is he still alive?

4805
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,260
I wanna watch this guy get a kill with this.

4806
02:37:21,600 --> 02:37:29,760
Are they just, like, is BuckFPS just landing on somebody and just his other duo is just, like, waiting until, like, he respawns?

4807
02:37:29,760 --> 02:37:31,160
Like, what's the strat?

4808
02:37:31,380 --> 02:37:33,020
Like, he keeps coming back.

4809
02:37:33,360 --> 02:37:34,340
Oh, is this guy gonna live?

4810
02:37:34,600 --> 02:37:37,340
I wanna see him throw the freaking fish at someone even though it's a condom skin.

4811
02:37:37,340 --> 02:37:38,420
Wait, that's so risky.

4812
02:37:38,760 --> 02:37:40,240
Like, yeah, he's so dead.

4813
02:37:40,280 --> 02:37:40,940
Just throw it now.

4814
02:37:41,140 --> 02:37:41,220
Oh, he's dead.

4815
02:37:41,400 --> 02:37:41,800
He's dead.

4816
02:37:41,820 --> 02:37:43,000
No, you guys threw it!

4817
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:43,660
How the hell, man?

4818
02:37:43,860 --> 02:37:44,260
No!

4819
02:37:44,660 --> 02:37:45,120
Throw it!

4820
02:37:45,120 --> 02:37:45,680
He could've thrown it!

4821
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:47,780
You're dead already.

4822
02:37:47,980 --> 02:37:48,840
Just throw it.

4823
02:37:49,240 --> 02:37:49,240
He knew he was gonna die anyway.

4824
02:37:49,240 --> 02:37:49,600
Yeah!

4825
02:37:53,520 --> 02:37:54,600
Oh my god, thank god.

4826
02:37:54,600 --> 02:37:54,780
No condoms.

4827
02:37:54,980 --> 02:37:55,980
Thank god.

4828
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:56,300
Let's go!

4829
02:37:56,600 --> 02:37:57,760
No condoms!

4830
02:37:57,760 --> 02:38:00,540
One condom team has won throughout this tournament.

4831
02:38:02,060 --> 02:38:03,080
Chat, you hear that?

4832
02:38:03,640 --> 02:38:05,160
Condom skins don't help you.

4833
02:38:05,340 --> 02:38:06,460
Yeah, they don't help you.

4834
02:38:06,780 --> 02:38:08,100
And you don't have fun.

4835
02:38:08,240 --> 02:38:10,080
You will never have fun if you have it on.

4836
02:38:14,040 --> 02:38:15,600
That's my favorite comment in chat.

4837
02:38:15,940 --> 02:38:18,380
It ain't much, but it's honest work for a one kill.

4838
02:38:18,380 --> 02:38:18,400
Oh shit, sorry.

4839
02:38:18,420 --> 02:38:19,680
Out of context, by the way.

4840
02:38:22,500 --> 02:38:24,600
I did not mean it like that.

4841
02:38:25,420 --> 02:38:26,680
I'm freezing.

4842
02:38:27,760 --> 02:38:29,080
Oh no!

4843
02:38:39,260 --> 02:38:41,160
STDs is a problem.

4844
02:38:49,220 --> 02:38:54,940
Oh, I'm fucking dying.

4845
02:38:55,280 --> 02:38:55,940
I'm dying.

4846
02:38:56,140 --> 02:39:03,480
Oh my god.

4847
02:39:05,280 --> 02:39:06,900
I'm making it worse.

4848
02:39:07,340 --> 02:39:08,220
I literally cannot.

4849
02:39:08,520 --> 02:39:09,480
I cannot right now.

4850
02:39:10,720 --> 02:39:13,440
Toki, I didn't know I was gonna literally die of laughter.

4851
02:39:13,540 --> 02:39:14,180
Oh my god.

4852
02:39:14,420 --> 02:39:15,580
This entire tournament.

4853
02:39:15,960 --> 02:39:16,880
This tournament.

4854
02:39:19,840 --> 02:39:20,280
Tournament.

4855
02:39:21,160 --> 02:39:22,680
Wait, what's our thing this next one?

4856
02:39:22,820 --> 02:39:23,440
What are we gonna be?

4857
02:39:23,480 --> 02:39:24,200
Oh yeah, last one.

4858
02:39:24,960 --> 02:39:26,040
Yeah, it's our last one.

4859
02:39:27,060 --> 02:39:28,380
And then we have day two tomorrow.

4860
02:39:28,760 --> 02:39:29,880
Okay, then we have day two.

4861
02:39:30,120 --> 02:39:30,560
Okay.

4862
02:39:30,860 --> 02:39:32,580
Then we have day two.

4863
02:39:34,380 --> 02:39:35,440
I could play like...

4864
02:39:35,440 --> 02:39:36,440
Wait, do you have any Futurama?

4865
02:39:37,240 --> 02:39:37,780
Oh, I do.

4866
02:39:37,840 --> 02:39:38,540
I do have Futurama.

4867
02:39:38,540 --> 02:39:39,260
I have Bendy.

4868
02:39:39,820 --> 02:39:40,900
Okay, I have Leela.

4869
02:39:41,360 --> 02:39:42,180
Okay, yeah, yeah.

4870
02:39:42,320 --> 02:39:43,280
Oh, you don't have Fry?

4871
02:39:43,640 --> 02:39:43,960
No!

4872
02:39:44,700 --> 02:39:45,140
I do.

4873
02:39:45,180 --> 02:39:45,800
No, I do have Fry.

4874
02:39:45,880 --> 02:39:46,220
I have Fry.

4875
02:39:46,340 --> 02:39:46,960
Oh, Fry and Bendy!

4876
02:39:47,060 --> 02:39:47,360
Let's go!

4877
02:39:47,680 --> 02:39:48,300
Okay, okay, okay.

4878
02:39:48,300 --> 02:39:49,000
I'm down, I'm down, I'm down.

4879
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:49,760
Fry and Bendy.

4880
02:39:50,580 --> 02:39:50,900
Okay.

4881
02:39:51,040 --> 02:39:52,680
If Fry and Bendy, I'm gonna get a golf club.

4882
02:39:53,700 --> 02:39:56,540
Yeah, we gonna be pay to lose looking at.

4883
02:39:57,620 --> 02:40:00,180
Have you ever seen how big these freaking skins are?

4884
02:40:00,880 --> 02:40:01,200
Yeah.

4885
02:40:01,200 --> 02:40:03,320
They are so ridiculous.

4886
02:40:04,380 --> 02:40:04,960
Let's go!

4887
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:07,160
Oh, my God.

4888
02:40:07,440 --> 02:40:08,400
Let's fucking go.

4889
02:40:08,880 --> 02:40:09,600
Are we winning?

4890
02:40:09,780 --> 02:40:10,680
Oh, we are totally winning.

4891
02:40:10,920 --> 02:40:11,880
We're winning in life.

4892
02:40:11,960 --> 02:40:12,820
That's all that matters.

4893
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,420
We are consistent on our placement.

4894
02:40:15,520 --> 02:40:17,220
We got one kill last game.

4895
02:40:17,680 --> 02:40:18,900
Pay to lose.

4896
02:40:22,460 --> 02:40:23,240
What are you?

4897
02:40:23,340 --> 02:40:24,300
I'm gonna use the stop sign.

4898
02:40:24,580 --> 02:40:26,280
I'm running out of skins for tomorrow.

4899
02:40:27,400 --> 02:40:29,640
Do Fortnite skins change hitbox size as well?

4900
02:40:29,800 --> 02:40:31,180
No, I believe they're all the same.

4901
02:40:32,400 --> 02:40:35,540
There might be like three different like variants, I think.

4902
02:40:35,600 --> 02:40:37,580
There's like the very chonky big skins.

4903
02:40:37,980 --> 02:40:38,520
Yeah.

4904
02:40:38,760 --> 02:40:40,700
There's like the normal male skin.

4905
02:40:40,780 --> 02:40:41,080
That's why you see all of them use those.

4906
02:40:41,440 --> 02:40:45,840
Use that same fucking skin over and over again.

4907
02:40:46,540 --> 02:40:47,580
Giant Chicken or Riot?

4908
02:40:47,740 --> 02:40:48,640
We were already Giant Chicken.

4909
02:40:48,900 --> 02:40:49,760
Yeah, we did Giant Chicken.

4910
02:40:49,860 --> 02:40:50,920
Somebody wasn't watching.

4911
02:40:51,440 --> 02:40:51,980
Yeah.

4912
02:40:52,320 --> 02:40:52,740
Yeah.

4913
02:40:53,240 --> 02:40:53,940
It's there.

4914
02:40:54,140 --> 02:40:54,960
Look in the Vaude.

4915
02:40:55,680 --> 02:40:56,540
I love you.

4916
02:40:57,340 --> 02:40:58,320
I don't.

4917
02:40:59,100 --> 02:40:59,940
Fuck you.

4918
02:41:02,740 --> 02:41:04,820
Potato's gonna go like cry, cries in corner.

4919
02:41:04,960 --> 02:41:05,440
Yeah, cry.

4920
02:41:11,160 --> 02:41:13,260
I'm gonna use a giant inflatable horse.

4921
02:41:14,060 --> 02:41:15,520
This is the win team right here.

4922
02:41:23,900 --> 02:41:24,900
This is it.

4923
02:41:25,180 --> 02:41:25,940
I believe.

4924
02:41:26,100 --> 02:41:26,380
This is it.

4925
02:41:26,380 --> 02:41:26,780
Last game, guys.

4926
02:41:27,880 --> 02:41:30,780
This is last game and then we'll be free until tomorrow.

4927
02:41:31,320 --> 02:41:32,300
Oh my god.

4928
02:41:32,300 --> 02:41:33,320
Are you ready for tomorrow?

4929
02:41:33,520 --> 02:41:33,980
Are you ready?

4930
02:41:34,040 --> 02:41:34,280
No.

4931
02:41:34,280 --> 02:41:35,560
Today was just a warm up day.

4932
02:41:37,800 --> 02:41:39,680
Today's just a warm up.

4933
02:41:40,320 --> 02:41:42,140
Wait, you haven't played this season, have you?

4934
02:41:42,220 --> 02:41:43,580
No, of course not.

4935
02:41:45,560 --> 02:41:47,620
Dude, this... you're in for a treat.

4936
02:41:47,740 --> 02:41:49,140
There's so much, I guess.

4937
02:41:49,360 --> 02:41:49,940
Holy shit.

4938
02:41:49,980 --> 02:41:51,160
In the current season.

4939
02:41:51,280 --> 02:41:55,520
Alright, after this game, we gotta play one like chill lobby.

4940
02:41:56,080 --> 02:41:57,560
I'm down to do a chill lobby.

4941
02:41:57,600 --> 02:41:57,700
I'm down.

4942
02:41:57,700 --> 02:41:59,260
I wanna know what it feels like to actually shoot my gun.

4943
02:41:59,420 --> 02:41:59,940
I don't...

4944
02:42:04,620 --> 02:42:05,460
Where have you shot?

4945
02:42:05,480 --> 02:42:06,780
No, you shot your gun once, right?

4946
02:42:06,980 --> 02:42:12,140
Yeah, I shot my gun once last game, but still I wonder what it feels like to like shoot more than one time.

4947
02:42:12,360 --> 02:42:14,400
Like, you know, get a kill, you know?

4948
02:42:14,440 --> 02:42:16,520
I wanna know what it's like to be top five.

4949
02:42:16,880 --> 02:42:17,760
I wanna know.

4950
02:42:18,460 --> 02:42:21,000
Oh, we are gonna get so many top five.

4951
02:42:21,060 --> 02:42:22,020
We're gonna get a top one.

4952
02:42:23,040 --> 02:42:24,340
Oh, they haven't posted the code yet.

4953
02:42:24,340 --> 02:42:24,780
Oh, they haven't?

4954
02:42:24,820 --> 02:42:25,300
Thank god.

4955
02:42:25,420 --> 02:42:25,620
Alright.

4956
02:42:25,660 --> 02:42:27,020
Oh, they're typing it like right now.

4957
02:42:27,480 --> 02:42:29,120
Oh, I can ready in advance.

4958
02:42:29,540 --> 02:42:30,040
That's good.

4959
02:42:30,100 --> 02:42:30,500
Thank god.

4960
02:42:31,660 --> 02:42:32,220
Oh, yeah?

4961
02:42:32,380 --> 02:42:32,880
Oh, shit.

4962
02:42:32,880 --> 02:42:33,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4963
02:42:33,580 --> 02:42:34,420
Okay, okay.

4964
02:42:35,500 --> 02:42:36,920
They have... Oh, wow, you're right.

4965
02:42:36,980 --> 02:42:38,300
They did add Lady Gaga back in.

4966
02:42:38,400 --> 02:42:38,740
Yeah.

4967
02:42:38,740 --> 02:42:39,440
I didn't even notice that.

4968
02:42:41,040 --> 02:42:41,440
Oh?

4969
02:42:41,800 --> 02:42:42,540
Wait, they stopped typing.

4970
02:42:45,460 --> 02:42:47,760
Doki, are you gonna be a Fortnite streamer now after this tournament?

4971
02:42:48,040 --> 02:42:50,340
If I get a Fortnite skin, I'll be a Fortnite streamer.

4972
02:42:50,360 --> 02:42:51,060
You hear that, Fortnite?

4973
02:42:51,500 --> 02:42:52,180
Yeah, Fortnite.

4974
02:42:52,660 --> 02:42:53,060
You hear that?

4975
02:42:53,060 --> 02:42:53,660
You hear that?

4976
02:42:55,240 --> 02:42:56,280
Doki's skin or Riot?

4977
02:42:57,840 --> 02:42:58,240
Yeah.

4978
02:42:58,760 --> 02:42:59,580
If you don't...

4979
02:42:59,580 --> 02:43:05,660
Imagine, imagine the money you'll make having a VTuber skin.

4980
02:43:06,300 --> 02:43:07,980
They have no VTuber skins yet.

4981
02:43:08,040 --> 02:43:09,360
Yeah, imagine.

4982
02:43:11,300 --> 02:43:11,620
Imagine.

4983
02:43:12,340 --> 02:43:18,980
I am all in all for VTuber skin and some furry skin, even though they already have a lot.

4984
02:43:20,400 --> 02:43:21,100
The fuck?

4985
02:43:21,700 --> 02:43:22,980
Don't listen to him.

4986
02:43:23,100 --> 02:43:26,140
I just want... I just want my skin.

4987
02:43:28,120 --> 02:43:29,200
Doki or Riot.

4988
02:43:29,580 --> 02:43:30,020
Yeah.

4989
02:43:31,040 --> 02:43:32,900
I just want my skin.

4990
02:43:35,300 --> 02:43:39,220
I can't believe that guy had a... a golden flopper or whatever it's called.

4991
02:43:39,240 --> 02:43:40,560
It's like apparently really rare.

4992
02:43:41,220 --> 02:43:43,600
Yeah, that's what like... that's what peeps were saying.

4993
02:43:43,920 --> 02:43:44,500
Yeah, yeah.

4994
02:43:44,560 --> 02:43:46,640
I heard everybody's like, oh, yeah, that's so rare to get.

4995
02:43:46,800 --> 02:43:49,500
And then like he threw that trophy and the guy just died.

4996
02:43:50,140 --> 02:43:52,180
Like, it was like blunt head trauma.

4997
02:43:52,640 --> 02:43:54,780
We got to like watch one person die to it.

4998
02:43:54,920 --> 02:43:55,280
Yeah.

4999
02:43:55,300 --> 02:43:55,960
That's all that matters.

5000
02:43:55,980 --> 02:43:56,120
Yeah.

5001
02:43:56,120 --> 02:43:56,980
It's fucking crazy.

5002
02:43:57,060 --> 02:43:57,880
We witnessed a murder.

5003
02:43:58,260 --> 02:44:02,800
Like, we witnessed a lot of murders, but like that murder was like extra gruesome.

5004
02:44:03,480 --> 02:44:05,260
Are they streaming the tournament right now?

5005
02:44:05,360 --> 02:44:05,640
Like...

5006
02:44:05,640 --> 02:44:07,300
Well, I mean, it's a Twitch Rivals, so...

5007
02:44:07,300 --> 02:44:07,540
Oh, yeah.

5008
02:44:07,580 --> 02:44:07,880
Oh, yeah.

5009
02:44:07,940 --> 02:44:08,360
Twitch Rivals.

5010
02:44:08,380 --> 02:44:08,780
Yeah.

5011
02:44:08,940 --> 02:44:10,400
Did you forget we're in the Twi...

5012
02:44:10,400 --> 02:44:11,400
Like, what are we playing?

5013
02:44:11,600 --> 02:44:13,880
I saw that it was like State Farm.

5014
02:44:14,140 --> 02:44:15,020
Like, you can think...

5015
02:44:15,020 --> 02:44:16,760
I wonder if State Farm is streaming.

5016
02:44:18,480 --> 02:44:19,400
Oh, we got the code.

5017
02:44:19,460 --> 02:44:19,620
Okay.

5018
02:44:19,680 --> 02:44:20,080
We got the code.

5019
02:44:20,560 --> 02:44:20,960
Nice.

5020
02:44:22,700 --> 02:44:26,100
Guys, I want a Doki Fortnite skin.

5021
02:44:29,080 --> 02:44:32,240
I have children watching me, even though they're not supposed to.

5022
02:44:34,840 --> 02:44:36,440
I found out.

5023
02:44:37,520 --> 02:44:39,120
There was a child...

5024
02:44:39,120 --> 02:44:42,560
There were children at my panel during a convention, so I know they exist.

5025
02:44:42,900 --> 02:44:44,400
And Fortnite was having...

5026
02:44:44,400 --> 02:44:44,740
Oh, was that one that Rikikonzi did?

5027
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:45,400
Yeah.

5028
02:44:45,480 --> 02:44:49,780
One of my conventions I did, I was like, I hope there's no children here because I'm going to swear.

5029
02:44:50,120 --> 02:44:55,480
And then it was like Q&A time, and then they gave a microphone to a child that was like 11 years old.

5030
02:44:56,100 --> 02:44:56,320
Oh!

5031
02:44:56,600 --> 02:44:58,100
Because I was like, how old are you?

5032
02:44:58,120 --> 02:44:58,700
And he's like, 11.

5033
02:44:58,960 --> 02:44:59,780
And I'm like, fuck.

5034
02:45:00,200 --> 02:45:05,880
And he just like shriveled into a like very, very shriveled up reason.

5035
02:45:07,620 --> 02:45:11,160
I was like, oh no, children should not be watching me.

5036
02:45:12,200 --> 02:45:15,480
I wonder if Twitch Rivals has shown us like surviving.

5037
02:45:18,140 --> 02:45:21,060
If they want content, they got to like be in our call.

5038
02:45:22,840 --> 02:45:26,080
I wonder if they're going to jump into a listen-in on us, and they're going to hear this.

5039
02:45:26,100 --> 02:45:28,100
I was being like, oh, there's condoms over there?

5040
02:45:28,200 --> 02:45:28,940
There's condoms over there?

5041
02:45:29,260 --> 02:45:31,340
And we're the Cocomelon of VTubing.

5042
02:45:31,520 --> 02:45:31,820
Yeah.

5043
02:45:31,900 --> 02:45:32,460
That's me.

5044
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:33,420
Guys.

5045
02:45:33,600 --> 02:45:33,900
Wait.

5046
02:45:33,960 --> 02:45:35,000
What skin are we going to be?

5047
02:45:35,100 --> 02:45:35,640
What do we are?

5048
02:45:35,800 --> 02:45:36,480
What do you mean?

5049
02:45:36,560 --> 02:45:37,180
We literally...

5050
02:45:37,180 --> 02:45:38,460
Are you okay, Doryu?

5051
02:45:38,520 --> 02:45:38,840
Are you?

5052
02:45:38,840 --> 02:45:39,780
No, I'm not okay.

5053
02:45:41,440 --> 02:45:43,800
We're literally the characters.

5054
02:45:44,280 --> 02:45:45,180
Everything's on blur.

5055
02:45:46,340 --> 02:45:46,760
How?

5056
02:45:46,760 --> 02:45:47,000
How?

5057
02:45:47,380 --> 02:45:48,260
I don't know what's happening.

5058
02:45:49,440 --> 02:45:50,640
I'm Doki Mellon.

5059
02:45:50,920 --> 02:45:51,820
I don't know what's happening.

5060
02:45:52,320 --> 02:45:53,220
Guys, we gotta...

5061
02:45:53,220 --> 02:45:53,660
Wait.

5062
02:45:53,720 --> 02:45:54,600
We gotta let...

5063
02:45:54,600 --> 02:45:56,080
We gotta let Fortnite go.

5064
02:45:56,080 --> 02:46:01,340
And Fortnite know that we do have children in our audience, because Fortnite loves knowing that there's kids watching us.

5065
02:46:01,680 --> 02:46:02,600
Because that's...

5066
02:46:02,600 --> 02:46:03,760
People who spend money.

5067
02:46:03,900 --> 02:46:05,320
As apparently...

5068
02:46:05,320 --> 02:46:06,140
Wait.

5069
02:46:06,140 --> 02:46:08,000
They watched us when we were Morty Under The Bridge?

5070
02:46:08,300 --> 02:46:08,900
Oh my God!

5071
02:46:09,280 --> 02:46:10,960
When we were what under the bridge.

5072
02:46:11,360 --> 02:46:12,820
Remember we were Morty and...

5073
02:46:12,820 --> 02:46:13,820
Oh, we were...

5074
02:46:13,820 --> 02:46:13,980
and Mr. Misty.

5075
02:46:13,980 --> 02:46:14,200
Yeah.

5076
02:46:14,280 --> 02:46:16,080
Misty and Morty.

5077
02:46:16,080 --> 02:46:16,460
Yeah.

5078
02:46:16,460 --> 02:46:17,400
They're watching us.

5079
02:46:21,520 --> 02:46:22,000
Nice.

5080
02:46:22,960 --> 02:46:25,380
All I'm saying is that, guys...

5081
02:46:25,380 --> 02:46:26,060
Oh, they're showing the same thing.

5082
02:46:26,400 --> 02:46:27,400
Oh, they're starting this.

5083
02:46:27,480 --> 02:46:27,840
Oh, no.

5084
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:29,580
No, we don't want to watch that, Doryu.

5085
02:46:29,620 --> 02:46:30,440
You don't want to watch that.

5086
02:46:30,620 --> 02:46:31,500
No, we're going to be in 15th.

5087
02:46:31,560 --> 02:46:32,460
I'm calling right now.

5088
02:46:32,600 --> 02:46:33,140
We're going to be in 15th.

5089
02:46:33,520 --> 02:46:37,220
I saw somebody mention that we were last at one point, so you don't want to watch it.

5090
02:46:38,300 --> 02:46:38,940
They're capping.

5091
02:46:39,120 --> 02:46:39,660
They're capping.

5092
02:46:39,720 --> 02:46:41,720
They obviously were not in last, you know.

5093
02:46:41,980 --> 02:46:42,300
Obviously.

5094
02:46:42,900 --> 02:46:44,380
We've been playing out of our minds.

5095
02:46:45,040 --> 02:46:45,580
Doryu, no.

5096
02:46:45,920 --> 02:46:47,400
It's going to break your heart, Doryu.

5097
02:46:48,580 --> 02:46:50,460
It's going to break your heart when you see it.

5098
02:46:55,640 --> 02:47:00,300
Yo, we're only two points behind the other teams that are behind us.

5099
02:47:00,460 --> 02:47:01,520
Or in front of us, I mean.

5100
02:47:02,080 --> 02:47:05,580
Like, there's three teams that have eight points, and we have six points.

5101
02:47:06,140 --> 02:47:07,520
Wait, we have six points?

5102
02:47:07,680 --> 02:47:08,800
We have six points.

5103
02:47:08,860 --> 02:47:10,080
How did they get eight points?

5104
02:47:10,160 --> 02:47:14,820
I literally see J3 die first, like, 200 times.

5105
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,320
That's because we're consistent on not dying.

5106
02:47:21,700 --> 02:47:22,840
What the fuck?

5107
02:47:26,200 --> 02:47:29,520
Oh, they get kills, because we're just doing placement, but they have kills.

5108
02:47:29,640 --> 02:47:30,360
Oh, that makes sense.

5109
02:47:30,980 --> 02:47:32,060
That shouldn't make sense.

5110
02:47:32,220 --> 02:47:32,580
It's not fair.

5111
02:47:33,040 --> 02:47:39,040
There's the people around us are like the sweats that make it to top five every time.

5112
02:47:39,360 --> 02:47:40,120
Is it really?

5113
02:47:40,360 --> 02:47:44,260
Yeah, we have the condom people and the Christmas hats people right next to us.

5114
02:47:44,560 --> 02:47:45,440
Oh, you're right.

5115
02:47:45,480 --> 02:47:46,460
It is the Christmas hat people.

5116
02:47:46,760 --> 02:47:48,520
It's the Christmas hats and the condoms.

5117
02:47:48,580 --> 02:47:49,280
It's not fair.

5118
02:47:51,280 --> 02:47:55,420
I wonder, since it's the last game, if we're going to get, like, ego sent on.

5119
02:47:55,900 --> 02:47:56,380
Maybe.

5120
02:47:56,480 --> 02:47:57,340
For the points?

5121
02:47:57,720 --> 02:47:59,200
Yeah, they're probably going to be like, hmm.

5122
02:48:00,020 --> 02:48:02,080
We killed one of them last time, though.

5123
02:48:03,340 --> 02:48:04,080
That's true.

5124
02:48:05,180 --> 02:48:06,480
Oh, I have Macarena.

5125
02:48:07,260 --> 02:48:10,080
All it took was you to be like, wait, there's someone here!

5126
02:48:11,480 --> 02:48:14,400
You're going to be literally locked onto them and just destroyed them.

5127
02:48:17,400 --> 02:48:19,380
Wait, let's sync up the Macarena.

5128
02:48:19,840 --> 02:48:20,320
Okay.

5129
02:48:20,320 --> 02:48:21,200
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

5130
02:48:21,200 --> 02:48:21,540
Ready?

5131
02:48:21,640 --> 02:48:22,720
Oh, you're go, you're go, you're go.

5132
02:48:22,760 --> 02:48:23,580
You should do the count, you should do the count.

5133
02:48:24,960 --> 02:48:27,820
Three, two, one, go.

5134
02:48:30,040 --> 02:48:30,440
Yay!

5135
02:48:31,240 --> 02:48:33,240
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

5136
02:48:33,240 --> 02:48:35,320
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

5137
02:48:35,560 --> 02:48:37,300
And Macarena!

5138
02:48:37,400 --> 02:48:39,360
I was like, a second off, a second off.

5139
02:48:39,380 --> 02:48:42,400
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

5140
02:48:42,560 --> 02:48:45,160
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

5141
02:48:45,160 --> 02:48:47,000
And Macarena, hi?

5142
02:48:47,480 --> 02:48:48,500
Ha-ha-ha!

5143
02:48:49,280 --> 02:48:49,320
Ha-ha-ha!

5144
02:48:49,360 --> 02:48:49,800
Ha-ha-ha!

5145
02:48:49,800 --> 02:48:49,980
Ha-ha-ha!

5146
02:48:49,980 --> 02:48:50,020
Ha-ha-ha!

5147
02:48:50,020 --> 02:48:50,300
..óc bench, to please have lunchout.

5148
02:48:51,640 --> 02:48:53,860
Yeah, no one can do it like we can.

5149
02:48:54,060 --> 02:48:56,100
Yeah, at least we're having fun.

5150
02:48:57,380 --> 02:48:59,020
Yeah, what are those guys doing?

5151
02:48:59,080 --> 02:49:00,440
Not having fun?

5152
02:49:00,520 --> 02:49:01,160
Exactly!

5153
02:49:02,520 --> 02:49:05,340
They're too busy strategizing.

5154
02:49:05,660 --> 02:49:07,560
We're peak Fortnite gamers.

5155
02:49:08,020 --> 02:49:11,460
Fortnite's not about sweating, it's about skins and dancing!

5156
02:49:12,140 --> 02:49:12,660
Yeah.

5157
02:49:12,760 --> 02:49:15,160
That's how they got 5 million followers!

5158
02:49:15,880 --> 02:49:19,440
And RP servers where you emote with Chun-Li and...

5159
02:49:19,440 --> 02:49:21,900
The richest Fortnite streamer!

5160
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:27,200
All they do is dance and buy skins.

5161
02:49:27,720 --> 02:49:30,420
We embody the real Fortnite gamers.

5162
02:49:31,620 --> 02:49:33,780
We are playing for the people.

5163
02:49:34,020 --> 02:49:35,440
Yeah, we're the people!

5164
02:49:35,480 --> 02:49:36,000
We're the Fortnite's people.

5165
02:49:36,680 --> 02:49:39,900
You think the children are building 500 houses?

5166
02:49:40,360 --> 02:49:40,660
No!

5167
02:49:41,440 --> 02:49:41,980
No!

5168
02:49:42,040 --> 02:49:44,320
They're out there being fucking Bender!

5169
02:49:44,660 --> 02:49:46,940
They're literally Bender and emoting.

5170
02:49:46,980 --> 02:49:47,400
Yeah.

5171
02:49:47,640 --> 02:49:49,420
And being every Jujutsu Kaisen.

5172
02:49:49,440 --> 02:49:50,240
Jujutsu Kaisen skin variant.

5173
02:49:50,500 --> 02:49:50,820
Exactly.

5174
02:49:51,880 --> 02:49:54,300
While playing Fortnite Festival.

5175
02:49:56,880 --> 02:49:59,060
Use my creator code, DokiBird.

5176
02:49:59,140 --> 02:49:59,920
Oh, I have that too!

5177
02:50:00,440 --> 02:50:01,080
Oh, you have that one?

5178
02:50:01,360 --> 02:50:01,540
Yeah, yeah.

5179
02:50:01,540 --> 02:50:02,800
Wait, do you have the My Hero Academia skins?

5180
02:50:03,040 --> 02:50:03,660
No, I didn't.

5181
02:50:03,660 --> 02:50:04,440
I just bought this.

5182
02:50:05,800 --> 02:50:06,760
I just...

5183
02:50:06,760 --> 02:50:08,660
I wanted this with John Cena.

5184
02:50:08,880 --> 02:50:09,320
That's...

5185
02:50:09,940 --> 02:50:11,100
Oh, my God.

5186
02:50:11,180 --> 02:50:12,420
I did not think of that combo.

5187
02:50:12,580 --> 02:50:13,160
That's actually terrifying.

5188
02:50:14,300 --> 02:50:16,880
I bought this emote just for John Cena.

5189
02:50:18,460 --> 02:50:19,420
I bought this emote just for John Cena.

5190
02:50:19,420 --> 02:50:20,180
For the people.

5191
02:50:20,560 --> 02:50:21,960
For the symbols.

5192
02:50:22,360 --> 02:50:24,240
What is happening to my eyes?

5193
02:50:24,240 --> 02:50:24,720
We're gonna plant trees.

5194
02:50:26,320 --> 02:50:29,220
We're gonna plant trees and burn plastic.

5195
02:50:29,820 --> 02:50:30,060
Yeah!

5196
02:50:30,440 --> 02:50:32,280
Because it's all about the balance.

5197
02:50:33,780 --> 02:50:35,400
What the fuck is that?

5198
02:50:36,860 --> 02:50:38,140
What the fuck?

5199
02:50:38,800 --> 02:50:41,900
I love how everyone has that same reaction with his emo.

5200
02:50:42,040 --> 02:50:44,040
I had the same reaction when I first saw him.

5201
02:50:44,040 --> 02:50:46,340
Like, what the fuck is he riding on?

5202
02:50:46,580 --> 02:50:48,900
Yeah, what the fuck is that?

5203
02:50:49,600 --> 02:50:50,120
Like.

5204
02:50:51,600 --> 02:50:52,860
Oh, yes!

5205
02:50:53,440 --> 02:50:55,120
Ballerina dancer meadow, right?

5206
02:50:55,180 --> 02:50:55,740
Rock and roll?

5207
02:50:55,840 --> 02:50:57,320
This is how you dance on the metal, right?

5208
02:51:00,280 --> 02:51:00,800
Dabababababa!

5209
02:51:02,800 --> 02:51:03,320
Dababababa!

5210
02:51:05,980 --> 02:51:07,420
What the fuck?

5211
02:51:13,400 --> 02:51:14,100
By zero...

5212
02:51:14,100 --> 02:51:15,760
This is the world that we grew up in.

5213
02:51:16,080 --> 02:51:16,340
Zero.

5214
02:51:17,980 --> 02:51:18,500
Yey!

5215
02:51:19,220 --> 02:51:21,620
Does this reset every bad, like... season?

5216
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:23,740
I know I've won for it!

5217
02:51:23,740 --> 02:51:25,160
Fortnite games, like...

5218
02:51:25,160 --> 02:51:26,820
Oh yeah, it resets every season.

5219
02:51:27,160 --> 02:51:30,080
Okay, I was like, why did I have zero crowns?

5220
02:51:33,600 --> 02:51:35,120
It doesn't even cover my hair.

5221
02:51:35,640 --> 02:51:36,600
Wait, it doesn't.

5222
02:51:36,600 --> 02:51:37,200
Yeah, the umbrella.

5223
02:51:38,420 --> 02:51:39,480
That's got a big ass head.

5224
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:42,780
Go Doki, give us nothing.

5225
02:51:47,800 --> 02:51:48,600
Chai Peppers.

5226
02:51:49,100 --> 02:51:50,200
Wait, what is this one?

5227
02:51:50,820 --> 02:51:52,040
I don't remember having that.

5228
02:51:52,120 --> 02:51:53,240
It would be nice if I had a crown.

5229
02:51:55,220 --> 02:51:56,780
Obviously, Chai, we're gonna kill the whole lobby.

5230
02:51:57,060 --> 02:51:58,640
Yeah, yeah, now this is different.

5231
02:51:58,760 --> 02:51:59,240
This is different.

5232
02:52:01,100 --> 02:52:03,120
Oh my god, there's condoms all around us.

5233
02:52:03,300 --> 02:52:03,960
Oh my god, wait.

5234
02:52:04,120 --> 02:52:05,600
This guy, I've never seen these guys before.

5235
02:52:05,680 --> 02:52:07,320
They must die before they could do anything.

5236
02:52:08,500 --> 02:52:09,320
Oh, I see you.

5237
02:52:09,820 --> 02:52:10,940
Oh, did you drop your crown?

5238
02:52:11,480 --> 02:52:12,240
I did, I did.

5239
02:52:12,380 --> 02:52:12,600
Nice.

5240
02:52:13,680 --> 02:52:15,080
Nobody wants to join our band.

5241
02:52:15,200 --> 02:52:15,920
They know we're losers.

5242
02:52:18,280 --> 02:52:21,000
We were cool before they even knew what the word cool was.

5243
02:52:24,220 --> 02:52:25,900
All right, let's get...

5244
02:52:26,540 --> 02:52:27,800
This is the one.

5245
02:52:27,840 --> 02:52:29,120
All right, let me know when to land.

5246
02:52:29,820 --> 02:52:31,260
Okay, I'll... let me ping it.

5247
02:52:32,300 --> 02:52:34,540
And then drop... now.

5248
02:52:34,760 --> 02:52:35,380
All right.

5249
02:52:35,520 --> 02:52:36,760
Yeah, oh my god.

5250
02:52:36,800 --> 02:52:38,340
You got the floaty.

5251
02:52:38,400 --> 02:52:39,700
The floaty floaty.

5252
02:52:39,700 --> 02:52:40,820
Yeah, I got the little floaty floaties.

5253
02:52:43,800 --> 02:52:45,940
Yay, Bender has summoned Shenron.

5254
02:52:47,380 --> 02:52:48,600
All right, here we go again.

5255
02:52:49,160 --> 02:52:49,960
I'm gonna laugh.

5256
02:52:50,060 --> 02:52:51,880
These guys are gonna probably shockwave on me one day.

5257
02:52:52,700 --> 02:52:53,720
Like right now.

5258
02:52:55,240 --> 02:52:56,600
Oh, I got a shockwave.

5259
02:52:57,220 --> 02:52:58,160
Oh, I got trees.

5260
02:52:58,180 --> 02:52:58,960
Oh, I got shockwaves.

5261
02:52:59,200 --> 02:53:00,020
Oh, I got trees.

5262
02:53:01,200 --> 02:53:01,620
Let's go.

5263
02:53:02,360 --> 02:53:03,060
Tree time.

5264
02:53:05,360 --> 02:53:07,060
Oh, I got more shockwaves.

5265
02:53:08,740 --> 02:53:10,200
I'm getting faster at looting.

5266
02:53:10,320 --> 02:53:11,720
You can see each game I'm improving.

5267
02:53:12,480 --> 02:53:12,880
Dang.

5268
02:53:13,140 --> 02:53:14,440
See, they don't even know.

5269
02:53:14,540 --> 02:53:15,000
Again, oh.

5270
02:53:15,180 --> 02:53:15,500
Yeah.

5271
02:53:15,800 --> 02:53:16,680
They're trying to push me.

5272
02:53:16,900 --> 02:53:17,740
Wait, are they actually?

5273
02:53:18,020 --> 02:53:19,040
Yeah, they're actually pushing me.

5274
02:53:19,360 --> 02:53:20,540
Wait, that's not good.

5275
02:53:21,220 --> 02:53:21,920
Wait, guys.

5276
02:53:21,980 --> 02:53:23,220
I am gonna do this.

5277
02:53:23,440 --> 02:53:24,460
Guys, let's play the game.

5278
02:53:24,560 --> 02:53:25,140
Guys, please.

5279
02:53:25,180 --> 02:53:26,040
Let's play the game.

5280
02:53:27,040 --> 02:53:27,480
Shockwaving?

5281
02:53:28,500 --> 02:53:31,380
These guys, I knew they were gonna be so horny for me.

5282
02:53:31,900 --> 02:53:32,500
Right here?

5283
02:53:35,080 --> 02:53:35,520
Oh.

5284
02:53:35,660 --> 02:53:36,240
Where are they?

5285
02:53:36,280 --> 02:53:37,500
They're on my bunk.

5286
02:53:38,880 --> 02:53:39,980
Wait, where are you?

5287
02:53:40,440 --> 02:53:41,900
I'm on your rooftop right now.

5288
02:53:42,860 --> 02:53:43,740
I'm gonna loot.

5289
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:45,180
They're not gonna kill me, right?

5290
02:53:45,700 --> 02:53:46,540
Yeah, no, no, no.

5291
02:53:46,540 --> 02:53:47,600
They're gonna kill Fry.

5292
02:53:48,940 --> 02:53:49,380
Yeah.

5293
02:53:50,080 --> 02:53:50,520
I'm gonna loot.

5294
02:53:52,340 --> 02:53:52,740
I'm gonna loot.

5295
02:53:52,740 --> 02:53:54,660
They burned your three jump pads, so...

5296
02:53:55,400 --> 02:53:56,460
I'm just gonna kill them.

5297
02:53:56,600 --> 02:53:58,400
I have a- those, like, Splash juices.

5298
02:53:59,120 --> 02:53:59,700
Okay, yeah.

5299
02:53:59,740 --> 02:54:01,880
Once you just loot everything, I'm gonna chill on the rooftop.

5300
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:03,060
I'll tell you if they push your anything with that.

5301
02:54:03,440 --> 02:54:03,700
Okay.

5302
02:54:09,490 --> 02:54:10,050
I'm ready.

5303
02:54:10,290 --> 02:54:11,090
Stop pushing?

5304
02:54:13,310 --> 02:54:14,790
Are you still chilling on the roof?

5305
02:54:15,150 --> 02:54:16,550
Yeah, I'm still chilling up here.

5306
02:54:16,570 --> 02:54:17,350
I'm just watching for them.

5307
02:54:17,750 --> 02:54:20,610
I must smash Splashes.

5308
02:54:22,610 --> 02:54:23,510
Ow, yeah.

5309
02:54:23,970 --> 02:54:24,370
Splash.

5310
02:54:24,470 --> 02:54:24,750
Yeah.

5311
02:54:34,650 --> 02:54:36,330
There's a shield potion here.

5312
02:54:36,530 --> 02:54:37,250
Oh, there is?

5313
02:54:37,250 --> 02:54:37,710
You'll keep grab that?

5314
02:54:37,870 --> 02:54:39,070
I'm gonna chill up here.

5315
02:54:39,110 --> 02:54:40,090
I'm gonna keep watching for them.

5316
02:54:41,130 --> 02:54:42,530
I'm pretty sure they just like ran.

5317
02:54:43,430 --> 02:54:44,550
But we're gonna like...

5318
02:54:44,550 --> 02:54:48,450
We can eat some storm and we can literally wrap all the way around here.

5319
02:54:49,310 --> 02:54:52,170
Or we can swim all the way around over here.

5320
02:54:52,170 --> 02:54:52,930
Okay.

5321
02:54:54,650 --> 02:54:55,870
We're living this.

5322
02:54:55,970 --> 02:54:56,530
We're living.

5323
02:54:56,750 --> 02:54:57,610
Yeah, we're survivors.

5324
02:55:00,250 --> 02:55:01,430
The president peaked again.

5325
02:55:01,790 --> 02:55:03,790
Oh, I see a condom scene down there.

5326
02:55:04,790 --> 02:55:06,830
Wait, where's the shield at?

5327
02:55:07,130 --> 02:55:08,650
Oh, I can drop it.

5328
02:55:09,050 --> 02:55:09,650
Okay, okay.

5329
02:55:09,810 --> 02:55:10,910
Here, it's on me.

5330
02:55:11,430 --> 02:55:12,050
Thank you.

5331
02:55:15,050 --> 02:55:18,050
Honestly, we can probably just go...

5332
02:55:19,190 --> 02:55:20,590
We can go in the water now.

5333
02:55:20,630 --> 02:55:21,190
Here, follow me.

5334
02:55:21,350 --> 02:55:21,750
Alright.

5335
02:55:21,750 --> 02:55:23,210
We're gonna eat storm.

5336
02:55:23,430 --> 02:55:23,790
We're gonna...

5337
02:55:24,630 --> 02:55:27,490
I have bandages, so I'm fine with that.

5338
02:55:27,790 --> 02:55:28,390
You got bandages?

5339
02:55:28,470 --> 02:55:28,870
Sweet.

5340
02:55:29,550 --> 02:55:30,030
Okay.

5341
02:55:33,550 --> 02:55:34,370
I'm gonna laugh.

5342
02:55:34,530 --> 02:55:35,670
This guy's gonna be in the bush right here.

5343
02:55:35,710 --> 02:55:36,450
I'm calling it right now.

5344
02:55:36,690 --> 02:55:37,850
No, please don't.

5345
02:55:38,290 --> 02:55:39,090
Please don't.

5346
02:55:40,690 --> 02:55:41,170
Please.

5347
02:55:42,570 --> 02:55:43,490
Please, I'm scared.

5348
02:55:43,910 --> 02:55:44,970
I'm just a robot.

5349
02:55:48,090 --> 02:55:50,070
I'm just a little robot.

5350
02:55:50,150 --> 02:55:50,430
I'm just a little robot.

5351
02:55:51,750 --> 02:55:52,790
At least you got bandages.

5352
02:55:52,790 --> 02:55:58,270
The only thing you gotta make sure of is don't heal until we're away from the scene.

5353
02:55:58,430 --> 02:55:58,570
Okay.

5354
02:55:58,570 --> 02:55:59,910
Cause it'll show an indicator when we're healing.

5355
02:56:00,070 --> 02:56:00,610
Oh, wait, really?

5356
02:56:01,090 --> 02:56:01,510
Yeah.

5357
02:56:01,510 --> 02:56:02,070
Oh, like the sound?

5358
02:56:02,890 --> 02:56:04,710
Yeah, it's all for the sound thing, yeah.

5359
02:56:04,950 --> 02:56:07,270
Oh, so that's why everybody has it on.

5360
02:56:07,630 --> 02:56:08,210
Yeah, yeah.

5361
02:56:08,470 --> 02:56:11,170
It'll show that and then you can just see all the footsteps and stuff.

5362
02:56:11,210 --> 02:56:11,970
It's really, really good.

5363
02:56:12,250 --> 02:56:12,470
Oh.

5364
02:56:14,470 --> 02:56:15,450
We're still good?

5365
02:56:15,930 --> 02:56:16,910
Bucky buck FPS.

5366
02:56:17,570 --> 02:56:19,070
Guys, kill this duo!

5367
02:56:21,150 --> 02:56:22,590
What is he doing?

5368
02:56:23,650 --> 02:56:24,830
Oh, I got bandages.

5369
02:56:24,910 --> 02:56:25,190
We're good.

5370
02:56:25,210 --> 02:56:25,890
Okay, we can heal here.

5371
02:56:26,010 --> 02:56:26,410
We can heal here.

5372
02:56:29,150 --> 02:56:30,830
There's some pads here if you need movement.

5373
02:56:31,870 --> 02:56:33,030
Oh, yeah, I'll take that.

5374
02:56:35,430 --> 02:56:36,070
We're living.

5375
02:56:36,890 --> 02:56:37,730
I feel alive.

5376
02:56:38,130 --> 02:56:40,550
I feel so alive with my 40 HP.

5377
02:56:41,230 --> 02:56:42,490
Oh my god, I see a team out here.

5378
02:56:42,630 --> 02:56:43,090
Okay, chill inside.

5379
02:56:43,250 --> 02:56:43,550
Chill inside.

5380
02:56:43,870 --> 02:56:44,310
We're good.

5381
02:56:44,390 --> 02:56:44,670
We're good.

5382
02:56:44,770 --> 02:56:45,290
What did they hear?

5383
02:56:45,310 --> 02:56:46,170
Heard me bandage.

5384
02:56:46,190 --> 02:56:47,270
They're all the way across?

5385
02:56:47,610 --> 02:56:48,390
No, I don't think they saw.

5386
02:56:48,450 --> 02:56:48,910
I don't think they saw.

5387
02:56:49,770 --> 02:56:50,470
I see one.

5388
02:56:50,650 --> 02:56:51,590
Wait, they definitely see us.

5389
02:56:53,610 --> 02:56:54,610
Almost cracked this guy.

5390
02:56:56,410 --> 02:56:57,850
I'm just gonna slide to the side.

5391
02:56:58,830 --> 02:56:59,150
They're bunkering.

5392
02:56:59,150 --> 02:56:59,490
I see them.

5393
02:56:59,730 --> 02:57:00,450
They're in the bunkering, yeah.

5394
02:57:03,710 --> 02:57:04,150
It's fine.

5395
02:57:04,170 --> 02:57:06,510
I just wanna apply pressure just so that way they keep on, like, moving.

5396
02:57:07,110 --> 02:57:07,930
Oh, we got a med kit.

5397
02:57:09,270 --> 02:57:10,130
Okay, I'm bandaging.

5398
02:57:10,750 --> 02:57:11,070
Okay.

5399
02:57:11,730 --> 02:57:12,590
I'm gonna chill on the roof.

5400
02:57:13,730 --> 02:57:14,430
What are you doing?

5401
02:57:14,470 --> 02:57:14,790
Leave!

5402
02:57:15,610 --> 02:57:17,290
We have not enough meds for you!

5403
02:57:20,130 --> 02:57:21,330
Keep on looting the house.

5404
02:57:21,370 --> 02:57:22,350
Yeah, come over here to this house.

5405
02:57:22,470 --> 02:57:25,010
And then we can see maybe there's seals over here.

5406
02:57:29,890 --> 02:57:31,710
Oh, they just bunked again.

5407
02:57:32,450 --> 02:57:33,890
Stop wasting your resources!

5408
02:57:34,990 --> 02:57:35,790
So real.

5409
02:57:35,990 --> 02:57:36,790
They're right there?

5410
02:57:40,530 --> 02:57:41,990
You're gonna get nothing from us.

5411
02:57:44,530 --> 02:57:45,750
Oh, they threw a med kit.

5412
02:57:45,970 --> 02:57:47,130
Okay, well I'm gonna have to heal.

5413
02:57:47,130 --> 02:57:49,290
I have more bandages so you need some.

5414
02:57:49,550 --> 02:57:51,230
Okay, just keep on holding onto those.

5415
02:57:51,410 --> 02:57:53,190
You can play that angle.

5416
02:57:54,630 --> 02:57:56,270
Okay, I guess not.

5417
02:57:56,490 --> 02:57:57,770
They might push.

5418
02:57:58,070 --> 02:57:58,670
I'm watching.

5419
02:57:59,630 --> 02:58:00,470
You can heal.

5420
02:58:00,770 --> 02:58:01,370
I'm watching.

5421
02:58:01,490 --> 02:58:02,130
Yeah, it's fine.

5422
02:58:03,390 --> 02:58:06,050
I just popped the med kit.

5423
02:58:06,250 --> 02:58:06,730
I'm good.

5424
02:58:07,030 --> 02:58:08,650
I'm good too, I think.

5425
02:58:10,350 --> 02:58:11,330
I'm gonna get on the rooftop.

5426
02:58:12,090 --> 02:58:13,490
I'm gonna non-stop heal.

5427
02:58:14,250 --> 02:58:15,530
There's another launch pad.

5428
02:58:15,590 --> 02:58:16,130
I'm gonna grab those.

5429
02:58:16,730 --> 02:58:17,090
Yeah.

5430
02:58:18,110 --> 02:58:20,230
We can shockwave away.

5431
02:58:20,470 --> 02:58:21,330
Wait, they have the crown?

5432
02:58:21,490 --> 02:58:21,990
What the frick?

5433
02:58:24,210 --> 02:58:24,570
Timing?

5434
02:58:24,570 --> 02:58:27,350
Okay, I'm gonna shockwave to the right.

5435
02:58:27,410 --> 02:58:27,870
I'm gonna go right.

5436
02:58:28,810 --> 02:58:29,170
Okay.

5437
02:58:29,550 --> 02:58:32,190
I'm gonna try to get ahead of them so they don't wrap around us.

5438
02:58:32,570 --> 02:58:33,310
Should I come over?

5439
02:58:34,050 --> 02:58:34,950
Yeah, come on over.

5440
02:58:35,050 --> 02:58:35,250
Come on over.

5441
02:58:36,110 --> 02:58:36,470
Wee!

5442
02:58:36,550 --> 02:58:37,230
Oh, I fucked up.

5443
02:58:37,610 --> 02:58:37,990
Woo!

5444
02:58:42,510 --> 02:58:44,170
So, I'm just trying to find some heals.

5445
02:58:44,310 --> 02:58:46,730
We can actually go through here?

5446
02:58:47,510 --> 02:58:48,370
Those bandages.

5447
02:58:48,630 --> 02:58:48,950
Okay.

5448
02:58:50,110 --> 02:58:51,190
Oh yeah, there's bandages.

5449
02:58:51,190 --> 02:58:51,610
There's bandages.

5450
02:58:54,650 --> 02:58:55,730
Oh, do you need shockwaves?

5451
02:58:56,270 --> 02:58:56,770
I'm good.

5452
02:58:56,850 --> 02:58:56,970
I'm good.

5453
02:58:57,050 --> 02:58:57,810
There's a heal here.

5454
02:58:58,110 --> 02:58:59,270
The little campfire.

5455
02:58:59,370 --> 02:59:00,210
Do you have a gold for it?

5456
02:59:00,890 --> 02:59:01,770
No, I have zero.

5457
02:59:01,850 --> 02:59:02,810
I didn't realize you need money.

5458
02:59:03,110 --> 02:59:03,770
Okay, you're good.

5459
02:59:04,050 --> 02:59:05,010
Oh, I have a med kit.

5460
02:59:05,010 --> 02:59:06,050
Okay, yeah, just go ahead and heal on that.

5461
02:59:06,770 --> 02:59:12,630
And then we're gonna have to like run into storm on the... or run from storm on this next one.

5462
02:59:15,150 --> 02:59:16,010
Oh, there's a chest here.

5463
02:59:17,390 --> 02:59:18,350
Oh, I found bandages?

5464
02:59:18,630 --> 02:59:18,910
Sweet.

5465
02:59:19,630 --> 02:59:20,790
Oh, I found splashies.

5466
02:59:21,530 --> 02:59:22,510
Oh, huge, huge, huge.

5467
02:59:22,630 --> 02:59:23,690
Okay, you can just use them on yourself.

5468
02:59:24,510 --> 02:59:24,790
Okay.

5469
02:59:24,790 --> 02:59:26,570
And then I'm gonna have bandages for us.

5470
02:59:29,410 --> 02:59:30,290
Oh, I have gold too.

5471
02:59:31,010 --> 02:59:31,970
Oh, we got med kits here.

5472
02:59:32,070 --> 02:59:32,570
There's med kits.

5473
02:59:32,570 --> 02:59:33,530
Oh, I need those.

5474
02:59:34,030 --> 02:59:35,170
Okay, I'm gonna toss it your way.

5475
02:59:35,850 --> 02:59:37,950
And then come out from the cave over here.

5476
02:59:38,530 --> 02:59:38,930
What are you tossing?

5477
02:59:38,930 --> 02:59:40,190
Just come towards me on this side.

5478
02:59:40,390 --> 02:59:40,630
Okay.

5479
02:59:44,780 --> 02:59:47,540
Then I'm just gonna toss it here at the edge.

5480
02:59:48,840 --> 02:59:52,660
And then before you use your splashes... I already used it.

5481
02:59:53,080 --> 02:59:53,640
Oh, you did?

5482
02:59:53,720 --> 02:59:53,880
Okay.

5483
02:59:54,020 --> 02:59:55,000
I'm gonna use those first.

5484
02:59:58,500 --> 02:59:59,280
Where's the med kit?

5485
03:00:00,080 --> 03:00:02,020
It's to the... it's right below.

5486
03:00:02,440 --> 03:00:03,000
Right here.

5487
03:00:03,200 --> 03:00:04,120
Oh, okay.

5488
03:00:06,880 --> 03:00:07,460
Wait, where?

5489
03:00:08,340 --> 03:00:08,920
Oh, it's right here.

5490
03:00:08,980 --> 03:00:09,440
I got another one.

5491
03:00:09,860 --> 03:00:10,800
Oh, it's right there.

5492
03:00:10,860 --> 03:00:11,600
Okay, I got a splat time.

5493
03:00:11,720 --> 03:00:12,040
I got it.

5494
03:00:12,060 --> 03:00:12,400
I can get it.

5495
03:00:12,580 --> 03:00:12,660
No, no, no.

5496
03:00:12,660 --> 03:00:13,400
I'll toss you another one.

5497
03:00:15,360 --> 03:00:16,040
Come and go.

5498
03:00:16,120 --> 03:00:17,960
We got 30 seconds or we're gonna have to start going.

5499
03:00:19,260 --> 03:00:20,780
I think I see a team over here.

5500
03:00:25,140 --> 03:00:25,740
Okay, med kit.

5501
03:00:25,820 --> 03:00:26,640
Med kit-ing up now.

5502
03:00:27,180 --> 03:00:28,240
Okay, I'm gonna med kit too.

5503
03:00:32,910 --> 03:00:34,750
Oh, I see a team literally on the edge.

5504
03:00:34,750 --> 03:00:36,550
No, leave us alone.

5505
03:00:38,270 --> 03:00:39,070
Where's this next zone?

5506
03:00:39,130 --> 03:00:40,830
Oh my god, this zone pull sucks.

5507
03:00:45,680 --> 03:00:52,300
It's not until we eat, I think, 500 storm damage that it starts doing storm sickness.

5508
03:00:52,500 --> 03:00:53,380
So we should be okay.

5509
03:00:53,720 --> 03:00:54,520
Storm sickness?

5510
03:00:55,080 --> 03:00:58,120
Yeah, that's where you start taking increased damage rapidly.

5511
03:00:58,400 --> 03:00:58,900
What the fuck?

5512
03:00:59,000 --> 03:00:59,400
Okay.

5513
03:01:03,500 --> 03:01:08,440
Okay, there's gonna be a team on the other side of that mountain, but we should be okay down here for now.

5514
03:01:11,580 --> 03:01:12,680
I'm all running over.

5515
03:01:12,840 --> 03:01:13,600
I'm scared though.

5516
03:01:13,600 --> 03:01:14,540
Okay, we're gonna go left?

5517
03:01:15,440 --> 03:01:16,400
Oh, there's...

5518
03:01:16,400 --> 03:01:17,980
Is nine gold enough?

5519
03:01:18,720 --> 03:01:20,980
No, it's I think 50.

5520
03:01:21,320 --> 03:01:22,100
God damn it.

5521
03:01:25,660 --> 03:01:27,380
Wow, no one is dying this game.

5522
03:01:27,700 --> 03:01:29,180
Please don't tell me that was to me.

5523
03:01:29,700 --> 03:01:31,600
Okay, I'm gonna shockwave over here, Doki.

5524
03:01:31,880 --> 03:01:33,340
Okay, I need to heal a little bit.

5525
03:01:33,340 --> 03:01:34,680
Okay, I might be able to just run in.

5526
03:01:35,280 --> 03:01:36,180
I had to heal.

5527
03:01:36,680 --> 03:01:37,300
Yeah, you're good.

5528
03:01:37,380 --> 03:01:37,520
You're good.

5529
03:01:37,560 --> 03:01:37,720
You're good.

5530
03:01:41,540 --> 03:01:43,520
Why is everybody playing careful?

5531
03:01:43,880 --> 03:01:44,440
Oh, there's nobody!

5532
03:01:45,420 --> 03:01:45,880
Oh no!

5533
03:01:46,140 --> 03:01:46,960
Are they shooting you?

5534
03:01:47,360 --> 03:01:48,720
Jump yourself or launch yourself.

5535
03:01:48,880 --> 03:01:49,060
I'm looking.

5536
03:01:49,380 --> 03:01:50,260
No, no, no, no.

5537
03:01:50,280 --> 03:01:51,900
Oh my god, there's a team here.

5538
03:01:52,140 --> 03:01:53,320
Oh, respawn, respawn, respawn.

5539
03:01:53,720 --> 03:01:54,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, live!

5540
03:01:54,660 --> 03:01:55,020
Live!

5541
03:01:55,760 --> 03:01:57,020
I'm living, I'm living, I'm living.

5542
03:01:57,360 --> 03:01:58,020
Just live!

5543
03:01:59,040 --> 03:01:59,700
I'm living.

5544
03:02:00,080 --> 03:02:01,180
You're gonna be good.

5545
03:02:01,500 --> 03:02:01,740
Just live!

5546
03:02:01,740 --> 03:02:02,180
Just live!

5547
03:02:02,180 --> 03:02:06,540
In five, four, three, two, one!

5548
03:02:07,440 --> 03:02:08,140
We're good!

5549
03:02:08,380 --> 03:02:09,800
Wait, I should've just died in the room.

5550
03:02:09,920 --> 03:02:10,820
Oh wait, no, I have nothing.

5551
03:02:11,040 --> 03:02:12,300
I didn't realize you lose everything.

5552
03:02:12,580 --> 03:02:13,200
You can land on the house.

5553
03:02:13,240 --> 03:02:13,860
Land on the house right there.

5554
03:02:13,880 --> 03:02:14,380
The one I pinged.

5555
03:02:14,720 --> 03:02:15,120
Okay.

5556
03:02:17,320 --> 03:02:20,080
Please be nobody, I'm just Bender.

5557
03:02:22,660 --> 03:02:24,460
Alright, I'll let you know if there's people in here.

5558
03:02:24,880 --> 03:02:25,280
Alright.

5559
03:02:27,080 --> 03:02:28,620
There's nobody here for now.

5560
03:02:29,620 --> 03:02:31,380
Where is this team at?

5561
03:02:31,500 --> 03:02:33,200
They're like, in storm?

5562
03:02:36,780 --> 03:02:39,360
Jesus, I'm hearing all of these fucking noises.

5563
03:02:40,180 --> 03:02:40,760
I'm going in.

5564
03:02:40,900 --> 03:02:41,260
Oh, it's ending in a minute.

5565
03:02:42,380 --> 03:02:43,640
I'm here with you, I'm here with you.

5566
03:02:43,800 --> 03:02:45,140
Oh, we inside this.

5567
03:02:46,080 --> 03:02:47,340
Alright, I wish I could give you heals.

5568
03:02:47,440 --> 03:02:48,700
I'm gonna give you the jump pads for now.

5569
03:02:48,920 --> 03:02:49,080
Okay.

5570
03:02:50,180 --> 03:02:51,740
Don't worry, I have 500 guns.

5571
03:02:52,760 --> 03:02:53,920
Ayo, you got 500 guns?

5572
03:02:54,020 --> 03:02:54,420
Oh, you need ammo?

5573
03:02:54,680 --> 03:02:55,440
No, I'm good.

5574
03:02:55,600 --> 03:02:56,240
I have ammo.

5575
03:02:57,580 --> 03:03:00,480
Okay, next zone is...

5576
03:03:01,340 --> 03:03:04,460
Do they have 200 RPGs?

5577
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:06,140
Oh, team coming over?

5578
03:03:07,440 --> 03:03:08,140
I think?

5579
03:03:09,160 --> 03:03:09,640
Where?

5580
03:03:09,640 --> 03:03:10,500
From which direction?

5581
03:03:11,240 --> 03:03:12,480
I hear people here?

5582
03:03:13,280 --> 03:03:14,420
Wait, this seems on top.

5583
03:03:15,320 --> 03:03:16,280
Mount 90!

5584
03:03:17,220 --> 03:03:18,660
I don't have SMGs.

5585
03:03:19,360 --> 03:03:20,220
And a rifle.

5586
03:03:20,780 --> 03:03:24,040
I'm trying to like, see what I can like, what we can play.

5587
03:03:25,680 --> 03:03:26,220
I'm trying to like, see what I can like, what we can play.

5588
03:03:26,220 --> 03:03:26,760
We can go this house.

5589
03:03:26,920 --> 03:03:27,140
Okay.

5590
03:03:27,540 --> 03:03:29,080
We're gonna try to get to the blue house, okay?

5591
03:03:30,020 --> 03:03:31,060
Okay, how do we get there?

5592
03:03:31,960 --> 03:03:34,560
Let's burn a shockwave or your jump pad to get over, okay?

5593
03:03:34,720 --> 03:03:35,000
Okay.

5594
03:03:35,440 --> 03:03:36,260
Get to the blue ping.

5595
03:03:36,300 --> 03:03:37,280
I'm gonna ping, or I'm gonna go now.

5596
03:03:38,140 --> 03:03:40,360
I think there's actually a team in here, but I'm going in.

5597
03:03:41,420 --> 03:03:42,480
Oh, I see a team outside.

5598
03:03:42,720 --> 03:03:44,180
Okay, I'm safe, I'm safe inside, I'm safe inside.

5599
03:03:44,580 --> 03:03:45,560
I got medkits too.

5600
03:03:45,760 --> 03:03:47,180
Oh, he saw me, they saw me.

5601
03:03:47,940 --> 03:03:48,800
You're good, you're good, you're good.

5602
03:03:49,340 --> 03:03:50,340
It's the Lara Crofts.

5603
03:03:50,580 --> 03:03:51,720
They saw us, they saw us.

5604
03:03:53,340 --> 03:03:54,960
I think they're gonna try to push us, 100%.

5605
03:03:55,340 --> 03:03:56,360
I'm just waiting for the bubble to go down.

5606
03:03:56,360 --> 03:03:58,060
It's gonna go down in 3, 2...

5607
03:03:58,060 --> 03:03:59,660
Oh, no, nevermind, they tossed another one.

5608
03:04:01,980 --> 03:04:03,580
It's gonna go down in...

5609
03:04:07,200 --> 03:04:07,980
3, 2, 1.

5610
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:08,460
I don't see them.

5611
03:04:08,940 --> 03:04:09,860
Can they burn another one?

5612
03:04:10,400 --> 03:04:11,380
They burned another?

5613
03:04:12,060 --> 03:04:13,760
Yeah, they're just trying to prolong the...

5614
03:04:13,760 --> 03:04:15,900
You know how B and B are, they're just trying to live.

5615
03:04:16,060 --> 03:04:16,240
Yeah.

5616
03:04:17,460 --> 03:04:19,360
I see them, they're running to our left, they're running to our left.

5617
03:04:19,580 --> 03:04:20,460
Okay, this is good, this is good.

5618
03:04:20,500 --> 03:04:21,580
We're chillin' inside, we're chillin' inside.

5619
03:04:21,980 --> 03:04:23,680
I see them, I see them, they're to our left right now.

5620
03:04:24,160 --> 03:04:24,440
Okay.

5621
03:04:24,980 --> 03:04:25,920
They might try to get to here.

5622
03:04:26,240 --> 03:04:27,000
On the roof, I think they went to the roof.

5623
03:04:27,080 --> 03:04:27,300
Yeah, yeah.

5624
03:04:27,680 --> 03:04:27,940
Okay.

5625
03:04:31,060 --> 03:04:33,380
They should theoretically get shot at by...

5626
03:04:33,380 --> 03:04:34,260
Oh, they're underneath, they're underneath.

5627
03:04:34,420 --> 03:04:35,200
They're gonna try to climb on this.

5628
03:04:35,960 --> 03:04:36,940
I think we're getting shockwave down?

5629
03:04:39,480 --> 03:04:39,740
What's this?

5630
03:04:39,900 --> 03:04:41,160
Oh, they're climbing, they're climbing right here.

5631
03:04:41,200 --> 03:04:41,800
They're right here, right here.

5632
03:04:44,260 --> 03:04:45,340
Okay, watch, watch the staircase.

5633
03:04:46,020 --> 03:04:47,580
Okay, I'm gonna go underneath, go underneath, go underneath, go underneath.

5634
03:04:47,820 --> 03:04:48,260
Come, come, come.

5635
03:04:51,720 --> 03:04:52,240
What the...

5636
03:04:52,240 --> 03:04:53,040
Oh, I'm trying to move.

5637
03:04:53,180 --> 03:04:53,960
Oh, sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5638
03:04:53,960 --> 03:04:54,820
Okay, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.

5639
03:04:54,960 --> 03:04:55,840
They're getting shot, we're getting shot.

5640
03:04:55,880 --> 03:04:56,340
They're getting shot at.

5641
03:04:58,100 --> 03:04:58,560
Oh, God.

5642
03:04:59,660 --> 03:05:00,380
Knocked one, knocked one.

5643
03:05:00,620 --> 03:05:00,720
Nice.

5644
03:05:00,720 --> 03:05:01,340
I'm thirsting for you.

5645
03:05:01,600 --> 03:05:02,220
I'm thirsting.

5646
03:05:02,300 --> 03:05:03,120
I got the thirst.

5647
03:05:03,160 --> 03:05:03,800
It's okay, I got the thirst.

5648
03:05:03,800 --> 03:05:04,320
I'm jumping, I'm jumping.

5649
03:05:04,660 --> 03:05:04,980
Please.

5650
03:05:05,040 --> 03:05:05,380
I'm good.

5651
03:05:05,580 --> 03:05:06,880
I got the first for you.

5652
03:05:07,460 --> 03:05:07,780
Yeah.

5653
03:05:08,100 --> 03:05:09,200
I got the first.

5654
03:05:09,780 --> 03:05:10,160
Let's go.

5655
03:05:10,720 --> 03:05:11,320
Just live.

5656
03:05:11,740 --> 03:05:12,440
We have a boy.

5657
03:05:12,440 --> 03:05:12,760
I'm moving.

5658
03:05:14,680 --> 03:05:15,320
Just live.

5659
03:05:16,260 --> 03:05:16,580
Oh.

5660
03:05:17,040 --> 03:05:17,360
Oh.

5661
03:05:17,820 --> 03:05:18,140
Shit.

5662
03:05:18,420 --> 03:05:19,020
This isn't good.

5663
03:05:19,120 --> 03:05:20,060
Oh, that's another team.

5664
03:05:20,080 --> 03:05:20,540
That's a full team.

5665
03:05:20,580 --> 03:05:21,040
That's a full team.

5666
03:05:21,120 --> 03:05:22,320
Live in the bush if you can.

5667
03:05:22,320 --> 03:05:24,040
Live in somebody's house.

5668
03:05:24,100 --> 03:05:24,320
Oh, good.

5669
03:05:24,640 --> 03:05:25,400
That's a hustle.

5670
03:05:26,100 --> 03:05:26,520
Yeah.

5671
03:05:26,580 --> 03:05:27,000
Oh, there's a point.

5672
03:05:27,080 --> 03:05:27,660
There's a point.

5673
03:05:27,980 --> 03:05:28,800
You get a point.

5674
03:05:28,820 --> 03:05:29,080
No.

5675
03:05:29,500 --> 03:05:29,920
No.

5676
03:05:30,700 --> 03:05:31,980
You would get a point.

5677
03:05:32,260 --> 03:05:32,700
You would.

5678
03:05:32,720 --> 03:05:33,580
We got a point.

5679
03:05:33,740 --> 03:05:34,960
I was trying to get the other one.

5680
03:05:35,240 --> 03:05:35,660
Yeah.

5681
03:05:36,260 --> 03:05:36,940
Oh, my God.

5682
03:05:38,880 --> 03:05:39,660
Oh, my God.

5683
03:05:39,660 --> 03:05:40,540
We got a point.

5684
03:05:42,920 --> 03:05:44,280
That's not advantageous.

5685
03:05:44,520 --> 03:05:45,240
Yo, Doki.

5686
03:05:45,320 --> 03:05:46,320
We placed 13th.

5687
03:05:46,320 --> 03:05:47,060
We got 13th.

5688
03:05:47,060 --> 03:05:47,640
We did better.

5689
03:05:48,480 --> 03:05:48,900
Proved.

5690
03:05:49,620 --> 03:05:51,380
Wait, you killed the guy that's in first?

5691
03:05:51,460 --> 03:05:52,000
That's a victory?

5692
03:05:52,320 --> 03:05:52,740
Wait, what?

5693
03:05:53,040 --> 03:05:53,520
Wait, what?

5694
03:05:53,980 --> 03:05:54,420
What?

5695
03:05:54,540 --> 03:05:54,840
Oh, no.

5696
03:05:54,880 --> 03:05:56,000
You're saying that's a victory in general.

5697
03:05:56,100 --> 03:05:56,280
Okay.

5698
03:05:56,340 --> 03:05:56,660
Oh, no.

5699
03:05:56,760 --> 03:05:58,900
We killed somebody.

5700
03:05:59,000 --> 03:05:59,700
That's a victory.

5701
03:05:59,980 --> 03:06:00,220
Yeah.

5702
03:06:00,440 --> 03:06:02,220
We got randomly rocketed.

5703
03:06:02,280 --> 03:06:03,480
It wasn't even the same team.

5704
03:06:03,640 --> 03:06:03,920
Wait.

5705
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:04,440
Really?

5706
03:06:04,520 --> 03:06:04,740
No.

5707
03:06:04,960 --> 03:06:05,560
We could've got two parts.

5708
03:06:05,560 --> 03:06:07,120
I didn't notice our second kill.

5709
03:06:07,280 --> 03:06:07,620
Yeah.

5710
03:06:07,700 --> 03:06:08,140
Yeah.

5711
03:06:08,160 --> 03:06:08,840
Because I was like, no.

5712
03:06:08,920 --> 03:06:10,460
There's the three of you.

5713
03:06:14,860 --> 03:06:15,300
Bro.

5714
03:06:15,880 --> 03:06:17,760
They should remove rocket launchers.

5715
03:06:17,860 --> 03:06:20,320
Remove bunkers and rocket launchers.

5716
03:06:20,920 --> 03:06:21,940
That's all I want.

5717
03:06:24,800 --> 03:06:26,580
Random RPG moment.

5718
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:29,940
Is there a special rule for killing the first place player?

5719
03:06:30,360 --> 03:06:31,160
Let me see.

5720
03:06:31,400 --> 03:06:32,400
I don't think so.

5721
03:06:33,500 --> 03:06:34,980
Because he still lives.

5722
03:06:37,480 --> 03:06:39,300
He's the one that got Doki and Storm?

5723
03:06:39,420 --> 03:06:40,300
Epic revenge moment?

5724
03:06:40,560 --> 03:06:40,900
Yes.

5725
03:06:41,340 --> 03:06:41,880
Let's go.

5726
03:06:41,960 --> 03:06:41,980
Nice.

5727
03:06:42,020 --> 03:06:42,680
Fuck them.

5728
03:06:43,240 --> 03:06:43,660
Yeah.

5729
03:06:43,660 --> 03:06:44,320
Fuck them.

5730
03:06:45,160 --> 03:06:46,220
Eat a wiener.

5731
03:06:46,240 --> 03:06:46,580
In game.

5732
03:06:46,920 --> 03:06:48,060
Or IRL.

5733
03:06:48,080 --> 03:06:48,680
That's your thing.

5734
03:06:48,820 --> 03:06:50,700
I love how you like broke into that guy's house just to kill him.

5735
03:06:50,740 --> 03:06:51,320
That's fucked up.

5736
03:06:51,360 --> 03:06:51,920
I love how you like broke into that guy's house just to kill him.

5737
03:06:51,920 --> 03:06:52,820
That's so fucked up.

5738
03:06:53,380 --> 03:06:55,240
His father was like, leave me alone bro.

5739
03:06:55,400 --> 03:06:56,020
I'm just here.

5740
03:06:59,140 --> 03:07:00,240
Let me see the rules.

5741
03:07:00,400 --> 03:07:00,660
Let's see.

5742
03:07:00,980 --> 03:07:01,440
Format.

5743
03:07:07,480 --> 03:07:10,140
See total number of players in the event.

5744
03:07:10,560 --> 03:07:11,020
Blink.

5745
03:07:11,020 --> 03:07:11,440
Oh my god.

5746
03:07:11,860 --> 03:07:13,760
There's only one condom team.

5747
03:07:14,420 --> 03:07:15,020
Thank fucking god.

5748
03:07:15,020 --> 03:07:15,040
Wait.

5749
03:07:15,060 --> 03:07:16,040
Only one condom team?

5750
03:07:16,120 --> 03:07:16,140
Yeah.

5751
03:07:16,140 --> 03:07:16,260
Yeah.

5752
03:07:16,260 --> 03:07:17,080
There's only one.

5753
03:07:17,700 --> 03:07:18,160
They learned.

5754
03:07:18,220 --> 03:07:18,280
No.

5755
03:07:18,280 --> 03:07:18,640
JK.

5756
03:07:18,640 --> 03:07:20,520
There's two.

5757
03:07:21,440 --> 03:07:21,900
I'm sorry.

5758
03:07:21,900 --> 03:07:22,500
One.

5759
03:07:22,980 --> 03:07:23,860
The other guy's a solo.

5760
03:07:25,500 --> 03:07:25,900
Wait.

5761
03:07:25,940 --> 03:07:26,080
No.

5762
03:07:26,100 --> 03:07:26,320
What?

5763
03:07:26,520 --> 03:07:27,580
How is this...

5764
03:07:28,960 --> 03:07:29,920
What the fuck?

5765
03:07:31,100 --> 03:07:31,500
Hey.

5766
03:07:31,560 --> 03:07:32,260
They have high ground.

5767
03:07:32,360 --> 03:07:33,620
How did they always have zone?

5768
03:07:33,780 --> 03:07:34,600
This is not fair.

5769
03:07:35,920 --> 03:07:36,800
These guys are...

5770
03:07:36,800 --> 03:07:37,620
They're on a sub.

5771
03:07:37,680 --> 03:07:37,960
Oh, wait.

5772
03:07:38,000 --> 03:07:38,400
What the hell?

5773
03:07:38,560 --> 03:07:39,340
Oh, that's a...

5774
03:07:39,340 --> 03:07:39,900
The POI.

5775
03:07:39,900 --> 03:07:41,760
I was so confused by that giant metal structure.

5776
03:07:45,180 --> 03:07:45,580
Wait.

5777
03:07:45,620 --> 03:07:46,380
Is that POI?

5778
03:07:46,960 --> 03:07:47,580
Or like no.

5779
03:07:47,620 --> 03:07:49,500
It's like an iconic thing, I think.

5780
03:07:49,620 --> 03:07:50,060
What's it called?

5781
03:07:50,160 --> 03:07:50,180
Yeah.

5782
03:07:50,180 --> 03:07:50,360
Yeah.

5783
03:07:50,380 --> 03:07:51,080
Cause there's a llama.

5784
03:07:51,080 --> 03:07:51,400
It's a llama!

5785
03:07:52,240 --> 03:07:53,480
Oh, that's what it is!

5786
03:07:53,560 --> 03:07:54,040
It's a llama.

5787
03:07:57,000 --> 03:07:59,500
Yeah, it's a llama, so it has to be part of the structure.

5788
03:08:00,660 --> 03:08:03,300
To kill the number one player that makes you number one?

5789
03:08:03,340 --> 03:08:05,280
Yeah, that should be the case.

5790
03:08:05,440 --> 03:08:05,700
It's true.

5791
03:08:06,060 --> 03:08:08,300
Oh shit, they knew he was in the bush!

5792
03:08:08,720 --> 03:08:09,660
That's so smart.

5793
03:08:11,480 --> 03:08:14,420
Once you play the game long enough, you eventually just never trust bushes.

5794
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:17,500
You're like, I hate bushes.

5795
03:08:18,640 --> 03:08:19,080
Oh!

5796
03:08:19,560 --> 03:08:21,180
Oh, that's the number one player, I think.

5797
03:08:21,620 --> 03:08:22,380
Oh, he's dead!

5798
03:08:22,760 --> 03:08:23,820
The one that just died.

5799
03:08:24,060 --> 03:08:25,620
Oh, yeah, fuck that guy.

5800
03:08:25,920 --> 03:08:27,060
I'm watching the...

5801
03:08:27,060 --> 03:08:29,400
I should not give the condom people views.

5802
03:08:29,820 --> 03:08:30,980
I'm watching the...

5803
03:08:31,500 --> 03:08:32,300
I'm watching the plunger.

5804
03:08:33,580 --> 03:08:34,900
I'm watching the plunger people.

5805
03:08:35,480 --> 03:08:37,900
I'm watching a grandma team right now.

5806
03:08:38,240 --> 03:08:39,600
Oh my god, they're growing trees.

5807
03:08:39,920 --> 03:08:40,940
They're planting a tree.

5808
03:08:46,540 --> 03:08:47,200
What's going on here?

5809
03:08:47,440 --> 03:08:50,760
Thank you for the real updates that I care about.

5810
03:08:50,780 --> 03:08:51,600
Hey, yo!

5811
03:08:54,680 --> 03:08:55,640
What's in the item shop?

5812
03:08:55,720 --> 03:08:56,580
Are there any cool emotes?

5813
03:08:58,480 --> 03:09:00,240
This thing I actually care about.

5814
03:09:06,380 --> 03:09:06,780
Oh?

5815
03:09:08,600 --> 03:09:10,460
I'm watching our red-headed team.

5816
03:09:10,460 --> 03:09:11,880
I'm watching the plunger team.

5817
03:09:12,120 --> 03:09:13,180
They have the plunger gun.

5818
03:09:13,980 --> 03:09:16,040
They're the ones that has a push.

5819
03:09:16,980 --> 03:09:18,140
Oh, the guys with the push!

5820
03:09:18,240 --> 03:09:20,400
I think these guys have won a bunch.

5821
03:09:20,780 --> 03:09:22,520
They won like two games back to back, I think.

5822
03:09:22,600 --> 03:09:22,860
Did they?

5823
03:09:23,060 --> 03:09:23,760
I can't tell.

5824
03:09:23,820 --> 03:09:24,420
They're all the same.

5825
03:09:25,900 --> 03:09:28,300
They're all the fucking same to me.

5826
03:09:28,440 --> 03:09:29,880
They're all in novice mode.

5827
03:09:30,820 --> 03:09:31,260
They're all in novice mode.

5828
03:09:31,260 --> 03:09:32,900
Get out of the novice mode, you fucking pussies!

5829
03:09:33,680 --> 03:09:34,540
Get out of the novice mode, you fucking pussies!

5830
03:09:34,540 --> 03:09:35,940
Who's stream-stiping you?

5831
03:09:36,340 --> 03:09:36,780
Who?

5832
03:09:37,880 --> 03:09:40,300
I'm telling you, you're literally the...

5833
03:09:40,300 --> 03:09:42,080
You're the voice of the people now.

5834
03:09:45,520 --> 03:09:47,200
Oh, they're getting pushed by a condom.

5835
03:09:47,420 --> 03:09:48,280
I'm 5 HP.

5836
03:09:50,100 --> 03:09:51,820
Oh, they're getting pushed by the condoms!

5837
03:09:53,020 --> 03:09:53,460
No!

5838
03:09:53,460 --> 03:09:53,980
Not the condom, kids!

5839
03:09:53,980 --> 03:09:55,020
I'm watching the grandma team again.

5840
03:09:57,140 --> 03:09:58,520
Oh, the grandmas are dying.

5841
03:09:58,920 --> 03:10:00,360
Oh god, not the grannies.

5842
03:10:01,180 --> 03:10:02,740
No, let the grannies live!

5843
03:10:03,040 --> 03:10:03,880
Oh, granny's dead!

5844
03:10:04,520 --> 03:10:05,840
Oh, the granny team's dead.

5845
03:10:06,000 --> 03:10:06,880
To a condom again.

5846
03:10:07,420 --> 03:10:10,280
Oh shit, it's like red-heads versus condoms.

5847
03:10:11,500 --> 03:10:12,580
And just one guy.

5848
03:10:12,760 --> 03:10:13,540
Just one solo.

5849
03:10:13,900 --> 03:10:15,980
That, out of context, sounds so good.

5850
03:10:20,060 --> 03:10:21,640
Oh my god.

5851
03:10:23,120 --> 03:10:23,740
Oh my god.

5852
03:10:26,140 --> 03:10:27,340
Oh, big brain!

5853
03:10:27,560 --> 03:10:28,800
Oh, but they're dead!

5854
03:10:29,940 --> 03:10:33,040
My god, this guy's level 445?

5855
03:10:33,580 --> 03:10:34,920
My god, this guy's level 445?

5856
03:10:35,100 --> 03:10:36,800
That's a Fortnite player right there.

5857
03:10:36,920 --> 03:10:37,000
That's a Fortnite player right there.

5858
03:10:37,000 --> 03:10:38,220
What is this guy, level 167?

5859
03:10:38,540 --> 03:10:41,160
I'm watching Thies right now.

5860
03:10:41,400 --> 03:10:43,080
Isn't he an OG Fortnite player?

5861
03:10:43,940 --> 03:10:44,700
Oh, who is?

5862
03:10:45,000 --> 03:10:45,580
Thies.

5863
03:10:48,080 --> 03:10:48,640
Oh, Thies?

5864
03:10:50,140 --> 03:10:50,660
Everyone's a noob.

5865
03:10:50,720 --> 03:10:51,560
I can't even spectate them.

5866
03:10:52,060 --> 03:10:52,420
No!

5867
03:10:55,600 --> 03:10:56,140
It's okay.

5868
03:10:56,440 --> 03:10:57,680
Get out of my screen.

5869
03:10:58,880 --> 03:11:01,540
I'm not even gonna watch your dance.

5870
03:11:03,580 --> 03:11:04,560
Oh, he said Thies.

5871
03:11:04,600 --> 03:11:05,200
I'm so dumb.

5872
03:11:05,220 --> 03:11:06,020
I thought he said Feast.

5873
03:11:07,000 --> 03:11:08,960
No, no, T-H-I-E-F-S.

5874
03:11:09,300 --> 03:11:10,980
Yeah, Thies is actually really good.

5875
03:11:11,380 --> 03:11:13,580
He's like one of the players I knew when I saw the list.

5876
03:11:13,580 --> 03:11:15,920
We want your feedback on a scale from 1 to 10.

5877
03:11:15,920 --> 03:11:17,420
How would you rate 1?

5878
03:11:18,080 --> 03:11:20,440
I strongly disliked it because the condoms won.

5879
03:11:20,920 --> 03:11:21,800
Negative 69.

5880
03:11:23,740 --> 03:11:25,540
Alright, let's play one game.

5881
03:11:26,160 --> 03:11:28,260
Oh my god, we get to play a normal game!

5882
03:11:28,600 --> 03:11:29,160
Let's go!

5883
03:11:30,540 --> 03:11:31,720
I want to be Mr. Beast.

5884
03:11:32,000 --> 03:11:32,920
No, I want to be John Cena.

5885
03:11:33,420 --> 03:11:34,340
You want to be John Cena?

5886
03:11:35,020 --> 03:11:36,200
Who do I play as?

5887
03:11:37,420 --> 03:11:39,440
Play your dream as content.

5888
03:11:39,860 --> 03:11:42,420
Let me play as...

5889
03:11:44,000 --> 03:11:46,560
I can be a big cat man.

5890
03:11:47,040 --> 03:11:48,020
Alright, let's see.

5891
03:11:48,100 --> 03:11:49,740
John Cena with the pom poms.

5892
03:11:49,840 --> 03:11:50,180
Yeah!

5893
03:11:51,780 --> 03:11:52,600
John Cena.

5894
03:11:53,880 --> 03:11:55,580
Thanks for the reminder again.

5895
03:11:55,640 --> 03:11:55,880
I forgot.

5896
03:11:56,400 --> 03:11:56,920
Oh!

5897
03:11:57,400 --> 03:11:58,500
Oh my god!

5898
03:11:58,880 --> 03:12:03,140
They added so many emotes.

5899
03:12:03,180 --> 03:12:03,680
Oh my god.

5900
03:12:03,700 --> 03:12:05,300
They added emotes that matter to me.

5901
03:12:07,780 --> 03:12:08,380
What's this?

5902
03:12:09,980 --> 03:12:10,460
Oh!

5903
03:12:11,540 --> 03:12:12,800
They let him go!

5904
03:12:13,240 --> 03:12:14,280
They let Cena go!

5905
03:12:15,440 --> 03:12:16,640
Oh my god!

5906
03:12:17,360 --> 03:12:18,340
Oh my god!

5907
03:12:19,720 --> 03:12:20,200
Okay.

5908
03:12:20,800 --> 03:12:21,880
Alright, wake up.

5909
03:12:21,920 --> 03:12:22,280
What's this?

5910
03:12:24,180 --> 03:12:25,980
Alright, I know which one I want.

5911
03:12:26,100 --> 03:12:26,780
I know exactly.

5912
03:12:27,280 --> 03:12:28,120
Pirates of the Caribbean.

5913
03:12:28,540 --> 03:12:30,140
Okay, they did not refresh these.

5914
03:12:30,820 --> 03:12:32,120
Oh, what the fuck?

5915
03:12:32,160 --> 03:12:32,980
Is that a monkey?

5916
03:12:34,660 --> 03:12:35,280
Hey, yo!

5917
03:12:35,300 --> 03:12:35,900
Wait, what?

5918
03:12:36,060 --> 03:12:37,320
Oh, I didn't see the rest of the shop.

5919
03:12:37,580 --> 03:12:39,120
There's like a monkey.

5920
03:12:43,360 --> 03:12:44,080
Is that it?

5921
03:12:44,320 --> 03:12:45,620
Oh, the stock monkey.

5922
03:12:45,780 --> 03:12:46,020
Yeah!

5923
03:12:47,400 --> 03:12:48,260
There's a monkey.

5924
03:12:49,860 --> 03:12:50,700
So ugly.

5925
03:12:52,800 --> 03:12:54,980
Okay, I know exactly what I want to buy.

5926
03:12:59,820 --> 03:13:00,920
Oh my god.

5927
03:13:02,220 --> 03:13:02,800
Pew pew.

5928
03:13:02,920 --> 03:13:05,160
Okay, so we are playing tomorrow for sure, I guess.

5929
03:13:05,280 --> 03:13:05,700
Regardless.

5930
03:13:06,280 --> 03:13:06,700
Yeah.

5931
03:13:07,940 --> 03:13:09,060
Dang, look at us.

5932
03:13:09,280 --> 03:13:10,480
We made it through to day 2.

5933
03:13:10,620 --> 03:13:11,200
I'm proud of us.

5934
03:13:11,220 --> 03:13:11,860
Oh my god, we did it.

5935
03:13:11,940 --> 03:13:12,840
We fucking did it.

5936
03:13:12,980 --> 03:13:14,100
We did it, day 2.

5937
03:13:14,260 --> 03:13:14,360
We made it through.

5938
03:13:14,360 --> 03:13:15,520
We made it through the day.

5939
03:13:15,860 --> 03:13:17,980
Alright, I got new emotes.

5940
03:13:18,600 --> 03:13:19,200
Let's see.

5941
03:13:20,520 --> 03:13:21,860
Let's see, where is...

5942
03:13:21,860 --> 03:13:23,460
I want to see what the standings were for the end.

5943
03:13:25,160 --> 03:13:27,400
Did that one point matter to us?

5944
03:13:27,540 --> 03:13:27,900
Did it?

5945
03:13:28,900 --> 03:13:34,980
Well, like, I wonder if we actually got another, like, more points than the other teams that were ahead of us.

5946
03:13:35,120 --> 03:13:35,340
Yeah.

5947
03:13:35,400 --> 03:13:37,000
They were only ahead of us by like two points.

5948
03:13:37,240 --> 03:13:38,180
You're a duck.

5949
03:13:42,500 --> 03:13:43,780
Oh my god.

5950
03:13:46,580 --> 03:13:48,240
Oh, you want to see the... this is what I bought.

5951
03:13:49,560 --> 03:13:50,520
Oh, you have that one.

5952
03:13:50,900 --> 03:13:51,920
They had mine, they had mine.

5953
03:13:53,940 --> 03:13:55,120
It's called Gunsinger, right?

5954
03:13:55,260 --> 03:13:55,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5955
03:13:56,780 --> 03:13:57,360
Pew, pew.

5956
03:14:01,020 --> 03:14:02,020
And I have this too.

5957
03:14:03,480 --> 03:14:04,600
Oh, look at him go.

5958
03:14:06,640 --> 03:14:07,720
Let him go.

5959
03:14:07,800 --> 03:14:07,980
Let him go.

5960
03:14:07,980 --> 03:14:08,880
Go, Sina, go.

5961
03:14:10,980 --> 03:14:12,060
Show those moves.

5962
03:14:12,960 --> 03:14:14,240
Oh, don't see what's going on.

5963
03:14:14,500 --> 03:14:14,980
Look at him.

5964
03:14:15,100 --> 03:14:15,720
Let him go.

5965
03:14:16,320 --> 03:14:17,640
Go, Sina, go.

5966
03:14:18,540 --> 03:14:19,200
Oh yeah, there.

5967
03:14:19,400 --> 03:14:20,580
I forgot to ready up.

5968
03:14:21,680 --> 03:14:23,100
Oh, I forgot about that.

5969
03:14:23,260 --> 03:14:25,820
I forgot about the actual part of the game.

5970
03:14:27,820 --> 03:14:30,400
No, we're playing the game right now.

5971
03:14:30,560 --> 03:14:32,820
Oh my god, now we can actually play the game.

5972
03:14:32,880 --> 03:14:33,260
Wait, okay.

5973
03:14:34,600 --> 03:14:36,920
Oh my god, what would it look like on...

5974
03:14:36,920 --> 03:14:38,200
Okay, I'm proud of us.

5975
03:14:38,260 --> 03:14:39,920
We got 13th on our last game.

5976
03:14:40,140 --> 03:14:40,780
Yeah, we improved.

5977
03:14:41,000 --> 03:14:42,300
We're consistently improving.

5978
03:14:42,740 --> 03:14:44,000
That's all that matters.

5979
03:14:44,440 --> 03:14:51,720
One of my really, really goated Fortnite buddies was like, I know 90% of that lobby list and you guys did really good.

5980
03:14:54,260 --> 03:14:55,600
That's all that matters.

5981
03:14:56,580 --> 03:14:57,800
I told you.

5982
03:14:58,680 --> 03:14:59,720
My bodyguard.

5983
03:15:00,340 --> 03:15:01,260
Oh yeah.

5984
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:05,520
I told you I'd block all the bullets with my big body.

5985
03:15:06,100 --> 03:15:07,260
We did it.

5986
03:15:08,380 --> 03:15:10,740
I'm not fluffy for any other reason.

5987
03:15:11,300 --> 03:15:12,740
We got our bodyguard.

5988
03:15:13,620 --> 03:15:14,060
Mixi!

5989
03:15:14,980 --> 03:15:15,860
Hello, Mixi.

5990
03:15:16,920 --> 03:15:19,120
We're continuing on the trend of condom skins.

5991
03:15:21,840 --> 03:15:22,280
Alright.

5992
03:15:22,780 --> 03:15:23,220
Nice.

5993
03:15:23,420 --> 03:15:24,860
Oh my god, I get to actually play the game.

5994
03:15:25,000 --> 03:15:26,760
I get to actually play the game.

5995
03:15:26,860 --> 03:15:31,980
Holy shit, I swear to god, if I see a fucking bunker person, I'm going straight up to them and shotgunning them in the face.

5996
03:15:32,140 --> 03:15:32,740
Yeah!

5997
03:15:33,180 --> 03:15:34,280
Let's fucking go!

5998
03:15:34,520 --> 03:15:35,360
Let's go!

5999
03:15:35,460 --> 03:15:37,000
I played against Fortnite pros today.

6000
03:15:37,080 --> 03:15:38,320
You don't matter to me.

6001
03:15:38,400 --> 03:15:39,280
You are nothing.

6002
03:15:39,440 --> 03:15:41,020
You're beneath us.

6003
03:15:43,200 --> 03:15:45,360
Oh my god, you have pom-poms!

6004
03:15:45,600 --> 03:15:45,780
Oh my god, you have pom-poms!

6005
03:15:45,780 --> 03:15:46,180
I do.

6006
03:15:46,660 --> 03:15:48,240
You're all beneath me.

6007
03:15:48,540 --> 03:15:50,900
I fucking played against Fortnite pros.

6008
03:15:51,980 --> 03:15:54,180
Who carried ten buildings.

6009
03:15:56,640 --> 03:15:58,740
Who carried ten buildings.

6010
03:15:58,740 --> 03:15:59,080
Bottom.

6011
03:15:59,440 --> 03:16:00,120
Bottom.

6012
03:16:00,920 --> 03:16:04,540
Who is this loser with thirty- Fifty-eight crowns?

6013
03:16:04,540 --> 03:16:05,420
Get out of here!

6014
03:16:05,660 --> 03:16:09,040
Get the fuck out of here!

6015
03:16:09,200 --> 03:16:10,920
Fifty-eight crowns, you loser!

6016
03:16:14,040 --> 03:16:15,120
We're in DC!

6017
03:16:16,380 --> 03:16:17,580
That's fucking right.

6018
03:16:17,740 --> 03:16:18,320
My crown.

6019
03:16:18,820 --> 03:16:19,420
Damn.

6020
03:16:20,580 --> 03:16:21,260
Damn.

6021
03:16:22,520 --> 03:16:23,720
They were like, nah.

6022
03:16:24,560 --> 03:16:24,900
Nah.

6023
03:16:26,360 --> 03:16:27,900
Alright, I'm ready.

6024
03:16:28,740 --> 03:16:29,440
Alright, where do you want to go?

6025
03:16:29,560 --> 03:16:30,480
Where do you feel like going?

6026
03:16:30,740 --> 03:16:31,900
Please tell me where you want to go.

6027
03:16:31,960 --> 03:16:32,680
What looks cool to you?

6028
03:16:33,480 --> 03:16:34,220
I don't know.

6029
03:16:34,800 --> 03:16:36,560
Uh, yeah, railways.

6030
03:16:36,560 --> 03:16:37,380
Let's fucking do it.

6031
03:16:37,680 --> 03:16:39,880
Oh my god, it's going to be so spicy.

6032
03:16:39,880 --> 03:16:41,340
You see that icon on the map?

6033
03:16:41,440 --> 03:16:41,700
The skull?

6034
03:16:43,140 --> 03:16:44,740
That's like the best medallion in the game.

6035
03:16:45,100 --> 03:16:46,760
And it randomly spawned over here.

6036
03:16:46,820 --> 03:16:48,220
So we're going to have a hell of people here.

6037
03:16:48,400 --> 03:16:48,940
Holy shit.

6038
03:16:49,820 --> 03:16:51,040
We can kill them, right?

6039
03:16:51,900 --> 03:16:53,880
Oh my god.

6040
03:16:54,420 --> 03:16:55,860
Oh my god.

6041
03:16:56,040 --> 03:16:58,220
Why are my frames dropping like crazy?

6042
03:16:59,800 --> 03:17:00,920
Holy shit!

6043
03:17:02,260 --> 03:17:03,380
Holy shit!

6044
03:17:03,380 --> 03:17:04,420
What the fuck?

6045
03:17:04,540 --> 03:17:06,580
I destroyed the first spot!

6046
03:17:09,640 --> 03:17:11,780
It's not even coming to us!

6047
03:17:12,400 --> 03:17:13,640
It's not even coming to us!

6048
03:17:14,500 --> 03:17:15,680
I killed one!

6049
03:17:16,380 --> 03:17:17,640
Come on, I'm with you.

6050
03:17:19,620 --> 03:17:20,340
I'm scared.

6051
03:17:20,840 --> 03:17:20,940
Yeah!

6052
03:17:21,080 --> 03:17:21,920
Freaking die!

6053
03:17:22,660 --> 03:17:23,540
I killed one.

6054
03:17:23,560 --> 03:17:24,180
We're good, we're good.

6055
03:17:24,460 --> 03:17:25,240
Wait, is there loot on you?

6056
03:17:25,240 --> 03:17:26,040
Is there loot on you?

6057
03:17:26,360 --> 03:17:27,360
Uh, there should be, yeah.

6058
03:17:28,960 --> 03:17:30,460
Okay, I'm just going to head to you.

6059
03:17:30,940 --> 03:17:31,580
Knock knock!

6060
03:17:32,620 --> 03:17:33,880
John Cena, he's here.

6061
03:17:34,440 --> 03:17:35,160
John Cena!

6062
03:17:35,700 --> 03:17:37,540
And his name is...

6063
03:17:39,700 --> 03:17:40,700
I got ammo.

6064
03:17:44,350 --> 03:17:45,510
Oh, they ran, okay.

6065
03:17:46,150 --> 03:17:47,570
And I have...

6066
03:17:47,570 --> 03:17:49,030
What the fuck is this?

6067
03:17:49,730 --> 03:17:51,450
I have Nitro Splash?

6068
03:17:51,630 --> 03:17:52,170
Is there a gun?

6069
03:17:52,170 --> 03:17:53,210
Oh yeah, I have a Mini-Tree.

6070
03:17:53,430 --> 03:17:54,850
And then here's the ammo.

6071
03:17:55,430 --> 03:17:56,070
Nice, okay.

6072
03:17:57,430 --> 03:18:01,010
And then once you're done popping those, stand next to me and I'm going to hit these canisters here.

6073
03:18:01,190 --> 03:18:02,530
Okay, I'm just going to grab this gun.

6074
03:18:02,970 --> 03:18:03,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6075
03:18:04,610 --> 03:18:05,550
And this too.

6076
03:18:06,010 --> 03:18:06,610
Alright, I'm good.

6077
03:18:06,970 --> 03:18:08,550
Where the fuck is this gun that you got me?

6078
03:18:08,750 --> 03:18:09,830
Flint, knock, pistol.

6079
03:18:10,110 --> 03:18:10,370
Okay.

6080
03:18:10,950 --> 03:18:12,750
Okay, so let's hit these.

6081
03:18:14,330 --> 03:18:15,790
And then I'm going to do this.

6082
03:18:15,850 --> 03:18:16,710
And you can run forever.

6083
03:18:16,950 --> 03:18:17,550
There you go.

6084
03:18:17,630 --> 03:18:18,170
Oh shit!

6085
03:18:18,950 --> 03:18:19,390
Oh!

6086
03:18:21,470 --> 03:18:21,910
JazzDV!

6087
03:18:22,110 --> 03:18:23,190
Get shit on!

6088
03:18:24,310 --> 03:18:25,810
Yeah, this team's dead!

6089
03:18:26,030 --> 03:18:27,550
Oh my god, what the fuck is happening?

6090
03:18:27,950 --> 03:18:28,470
Get fucking...

6091
03:18:29,670 --> 03:18:30,350
Where are you?

6092
03:18:30,350 --> 03:18:31,550
Where the fuck are you?

6093
03:18:31,730 --> 03:18:33,030
Where the fuck are you?

6094
03:18:33,990 --> 03:18:34,990
Where are you peas?

6095
03:18:35,890 --> 03:18:37,190
Where is the peas?

6096
03:18:37,310 --> 03:18:37,750
Where is he?

6097
03:18:40,590 --> 03:18:41,230
Oh god.

6098
03:18:41,510 --> 03:18:42,090
Guys, what?

6099
03:18:42,570 --> 03:18:44,090
Oh, I'm pushing him.

6100
03:18:44,910 --> 03:18:46,090
I'm coming over, I'm coming over.

6101
03:18:46,190 --> 03:18:46,830
Oh, I'm pushing that ass.

6102
03:18:48,170 --> 03:18:48,910
I'm going in, I'm going in.

6103
03:18:51,350 --> 03:18:52,330
I got lost.

6104
03:18:52,530 --> 03:18:53,550
There's too many doors.

6105
03:18:54,330 --> 03:18:55,850
How do I get out of this house?

6106
03:18:56,090 --> 03:18:57,190
Life has too many doors.

6107
03:18:57,610 --> 03:18:58,910
How do I get out?

6108
03:19:00,090 --> 03:19:01,030
Fuck away, chest!

6109
03:19:01,890 --> 03:19:02,570
We're alive!

6110
03:19:02,790 --> 03:19:03,270
We're good!

6111
03:19:03,570 --> 03:19:04,270
We're good, we're good.

6112
03:19:04,350 --> 03:19:04,970
Everything's fine.

6113
03:19:05,570 --> 03:19:07,770
I don't know what guns I'm holding, but everything's fine.

6114
03:19:07,770 --> 03:19:09,790
You're not like... You're like owning right now.

6115
03:19:09,810 --> 03:19:11,610
We just fucking own some of yours.

6116
03:19:12,330 --> 03:19:13,530
Yeah, that's right.

6117
03:19:13,990 --> 03:19:15,390
Get fucking shit on.

6118
03:19:16,410 --> 03:19:17,890
I need this.

6119
03:19:18,430 --> 03:19:19,230
Can I eat my apple?

6120
03:19:20,050 --> 03:19:21,650
Ooh, I'm gonna break in.

6121
03:19:21,750 --> 03:19:22,610
I'm gonna steal some gold.

6122
03:19:23,770 --> 03:19:25,310
Ooh, I'm gonna steal a cabbage.

6123
03:19:25,750 --> 03:19:26,330
Can we eat some cock?

6124
03:19:27,330 --> 03:19:30,290
Do you need any, like, ammo for your flint knock?

6125
03:19:30,470 --> 03:19:30,950
No, I'm good.

6126
03:19:31,950 --> 03:19:32,690
Yeah, I'm dropping that.

6127
03:19:32,770 --> 03:19:34,230
How many bullets do I have?

6128
03:19:34,430 --> 03:19:35,510
Is this one bullet, one shot?

6129
03:19:36,010 --> 03:19:38,610
Yeah, it's like a one shot, but it acts kind of like a shotgun.

6130
03:19:38,810 --> 03:19:40,730
And it also, like, launches you into the air.

6131
03:19:41,010 --> 03:19:41,790
Oh, yeah, yeah.

6132
03:19:41,870 --> 03:19:42,710
That's what I felt.

6133
03:19:42,790 --> 03:19:43,830
I was like, what the fuck?

6134
03:19:44,290 --> 03:19:46,190
Oh, is that what was happening when you were fighting him?

6135
03:19:46,290 --> 03:19:46,450
Yeah, yeah.

6136
03:19:46,490 --> 03:19:47,250
I was, like, fighting him.

6137
03:19:47,250 --> 03:19:47,690
Oh, you got people?

6138
03:19:51,190 --> 03:19:52,290
That's fucking right.

6139
03:19:52,370 --> 03:19:52,770
This guy's one?

6140
03:19:52,870 --> 03:19:53,230
Knocked one?

6141
03:19:53,430 --> 03:19:53,710
Nice.

6142
03:19:53,810 --> 03:19:54,410
Get over here.

6143
03:19:55,970 --> 03:19:57,030
That's fucking right.

6144
03:19:57,510 --> 03:19:58,090
Get out.

6145
03:20:01,550 --> 03:20:02,150
Where is he?

6146
03:20:02,770 --> 03:20:03,850
I cracked this guy?

6147
03:20:05,250 --> 03:20:05,930
No, I missed!

6148
03:20:07,810 --> 03:20:09,510
Yeah, that's why I was like, no.

6149
03:20:10,370 --> 03:20:11,650
I'm gonna try shockwave.

6150
03:20:11,710 --> 03:20:12,090
I'm gonna try shockwave.

6151
03:20:12,350 --> 03:20:13,870
There we go.

6152
03:20:13,990 --> 03:20:14,290
That's good.

6153
03:20:16,450 --> 03:20:18,210
Oh my god, I'm actually one HP.

6154
03:20:18,890 --> 03:20:19,650
Holy shit.

6155
03:20:19,830 --> 03:20:20,330
I have cabbages.

6156
03:20:21,950 --> 03:20:23,030
You want cabbages?

6157
03:20:23,390 --> 03:20:23,770
Yeah, yeah.

6158
03:20:23,810 --> 03:20:24,690
Don't bring cabbages.

6159
03:20:24,690 --> 03:20:25,070
Okay.

6160
03:20:27,150 --> 03:20:28,430
Thank you, Dawn Cena.

6161
03:20:28,550 --> 03:20:29,130
You're my favorite.

6162
03:20:29,270 --> 03:20:29,690
Don't worry.

6163
03:20:29,830 --> 03:20:30,770
I'm here to feed you.

6164
03:20:31,250 --> 03:20:32,550
Don't worry, little duck.

6165
03:20:32,550 --> 03:20:34,610
I'm gonna feed you some cabbages at the lake.

6166
03:20:35,010 --> 03:20:37,330
Don't worry, little duck.

6167
03:20:37,330 --> 03:20:37,330
I'm gonna feed you some cabbages at the lake.

6168
03:20:37,330 --> 03:20:38,270
Alright, let's go to the left.

6169
03:20:38,790 --> 03:20:39,910
Alright, I'm fucking going.

6170
03:20:40,010 --> 03:20:40,190
I'm going.

6171
03:20:41,550 --> 03:20:43,470
I'm feeding some ducks at the pond.

6172
03:20:43,830 --> 03:20:45,050
We are fucking owning.

6173
03:20:45,370 --> 03:20:46,830
Way better than these guys could own.

6174
03:20:47,570 --> 03:20:48,410
Yeah, that's right.

6175
03:20:50,290 --> 03:20:50,690
Alright.

6176
03:20:50,790 --> 03:20:51,510
Let's keep going left.

6177
03:20:51,910 --> 03:20:56,050
This is a shotgun run and gun harbinger SMG.

6178
03:20:56,110 --> 03:20:56,610
Is that good?

6179
03:20:57,370 --> 03:20:58,350
Uh, the harbinger?

6180
03:20:58,510 --> 03:20:59,770
Yeah, what color is it?

6181
03:20:59,930 --> 03:21:00,170
Green.

6182
03:21:01,130 --> 03:21:02,030
Yeah, it's not too bad.

6183
03:21:02,190 --> 03:21:04,350
That one's actually got like crazy buffs.

6184
03:21:04,550 --> 03:21:06,210
I think like a few patches ago.

6185
03:21:08,950 --> 03:21:11,290
Oh my god, I'm listening to twitch rivals in the background.

6186
03:21:11,730 --> 03:21:12,870
I have the nitro splash.

6187
03:21:13,930 --> 03:21:14,910
Oh yeah, nitro splash.

6188
03:21:14,990 --> 03:21:15,550
Is that the?

6189
03:21:16,830 --> 03:21:18,450
That's the one that you splashed on me, right?

6190
03:21:18,990 --> 03:21:23,010
Yeah, that gives you like infinite sprinting.

6191
03:21:23,030 --> 03:21:23,850
Oh, okay.

6192
03:21:24,390 --> 03:21:25,410
Here, I'll give it to you.

6193
03:21:25,610 --> 03:21:26,690
I don't want that.

6194
03:21:26,910 --> 03:21:28,070
No, no, you should use it.

6195
03:21:29,030 --> 03:21:30,370
I don't know what I'm doing.

6196
03:21:30,770 --> 03:21:33,450
All you gotta do is use it and then you start going really fast.

6197
03:21:34,130 --> 03:21:35,530
Here, I can split it with you.

6198
03:21:35,650 --> 03:21:37,050
There you go.

6199
03:21:38,130 --> 03:21:39,650
Alright, sweet.

6200
03:21:39,950 --> 03:21:41,810
Alright, I'm gonna pop it and we can start sprinting.

6201
03:21:42,130 --> 03:21:42,530
Alright.

6202
03:21:43,990 --> 03:21:44,990
Let's fucking go!

6203
03:21:46,830 --> 03:21:48,370
I could destroy the fucking bush!

6204
03:21:48,690 --> 03:21:50,430
Yeah, you can literally just run through stuff.

6205
03:21:50,630 --> 03:21:51,470
You like break through everything.

6206
03:21:52,610 --> 03:21:53,490
Oh shit!

6207
03:21:54,690 --> 03:21:55,310
Yeah, right?

6208
03:21:55,570 --> 03:21:56,630
John Cena's here!

6209
03:22:02,070 --> 03:22:02,950
Holy shit.

6210
03:22:03,590 --> 03:22:04,410
That's crazy.

6211
03:22:04,850 --> 03:22:06,130
Oh no, I don't have it anymore.

6212
03:22:07,170 --> 03:22:09,110
I think it was a 10 second shot.

6213
03:22:09,290 --> 03:22:10,310
I think that's like 10 seconds.

6214
03:22:10,310 --> 03:22:10,970
Wait, somebody's here.

6215
03:22:11,130 --> 03:22:11,750
I hear footsteps.

6216
03:22:12,270 --> 03:22:13,250
Oh yeah, that might be them.

6217
03:22:13,950 --> 03:22:14,750
Holy shit!

6218
03:22:15,210 --> 03:22:16,110
Run to me, run to me.

6219
03:22:16,590 --> 03:22:17,650
I ran too far.

6220
03:22:19,250 --> 03:22:20,090
You cracked one?

6221
03:22:20,290 --> 03:22:20,570
Nice.

6222
03:22:20,810 --> 03:22:21,330
You guys won?

6223
03:22:24,070 --> 03:22:24,990
I cracked the other guy?

6224
03:22:25,070 --> 03:22:25,370
Knocked him?

6225
03:22:25,590 --> 03:22:25,730
18?

6226
03:22:25,850 --> 03:22:27,190
Where is he?

6227
03:22:27,330 --> 03:22:27,690
They're dead!

6228
03:22:27,870 --> 03:22:28,830
There's another vehicle here.

6229
03:22:29,510 --> 03:22:29,910
Nice.

6230
03:22:31,030 --> 03:22:32,450
Alright, give me your shit.

6231
03:22:32,710 --> 03:22:33,250
Give me your shit.

6232
03:22:35,550 --> 03:22:37,310
Give me your fucking shit.

6233
03:22:37,450 --> 03:22:38,610
Oh, you have...

6234
03:22:38,610 --> 03:22:39,110
What is this?

6235
03:22:39,110 --> 03:22:40,730
Oh my god.

6236
03:22:40,770 --> 03:22:42,030
What did you throw at me?

6237
03:22:43,690 --> 03:22:45,230
I'm gonna swap my flint gun.

6238
03:22:45,450 --> 03:22:46,190
I don't want it anymore.

6239
03:22:46,430 --> 03:22:47,530
I'm done playing with you.

6240
03:22:49,110 --> 03:22:50,750
I don't want to play with you anymore.

6241
03:22:53,330 --> 03:22:54,630
I got a sniper now.

6242
03:22:55,010 --> 03:22:57,470
I cannot wait to find the movement item of the season.

6243
03:22:57,650 --> 03:22:59,690
Because you're gonna be like, What the fuck, League of Legends?

6244
03:23:00,970 --> 03:23:02,370
Have you ever played League before?

6245
03:23:02,650 --> 03:23:03,050
No.

6246
03:23:03,930 --> 03:23:04,630
Oh, you haven't?

6247
03:23:04,710 --> 03:23:07,050
No, I still have a life.

6248
03:23:12,990 --> 03:23:13,710
Tell him.

6249
03:23:13,810 --> 03:23:14,650
Tell him.

6250
03:23:14,690 --> 03:23:14,990
Tell him.

6251
03:23:17,530 --> 03:23:18,390
We're gonna get in here.

6252
03:23:18,510 --> 03:23:20,330
We're gonna go for a little drive.

6253
03:23:21,990 --> 03:23:22,350
Okay.

6254
03:23:22,350 --> 03:23:23,130
I'm heading over.

6255
03:23:23,670 --> 03:23:24,710
Yo, you're gonna drive your own car?

6256
03:23:25,030 --> 03:23:25,570
Wait, wait.

6257
03:23:25,890 --> 03:23:27,250
Oh, you're right outside.

6258
03:23:27,670 --> 03:23:28,690
Where did he go?

6259
03:23:31,030 --> 03:23:31,390
Nice.

6260
03:23:32,850 --> 03:23:34,170
What the fuck happened here?

6261
03:23:34,270 --> 03:23:35,070
Look, it's all broken.

6262
03:23:35,250 --> 03:23:35,810
Wait, you're right.

6263
03:23:35,950 --> 03:23:36,550
What the fuck?

6264
03:23:39,110 --> 03:23:39,650
I just feel fighting.

6265
03:23:39,790 --> 03:23:40,530
And they have the medallion.

6266
03:23:42,790 --> 03:23:44,190
Okay, we don't have any movement.

6267
03:23:44,510 --> 03:23:46,350
Other than our infinite nitros.

6268
03:23:46,830 --> 03:23:48,130
That's enough movement for us.

6269
03:23:48,230 --> 03:23:48,950
Yeah, we're gonna kill you.

6270
03:23:50,650 --> 03:23:52,030
We ain't no pussies.

6271
03:23:52,210 --> 03:23:54,030
Yeah, we don't have anonymous mode on.

6272
03:23:54,110 --> 03:23:55,190
That's when you know we're gamers.

6273
03:23:55,830 --> 03:23:57,010
Okay, I'm gonna get out of here.

6274
03:23:57,670 --> 03:23:58,550
Get out of the car.

6275
03:24:01,330 --> 03:24:02,470
We're gonna chase this dude.

6276
03:24:02,470 --> 03:24:03,590
Sorry for calling you pussies.

6277
03:24:03,810 --> 03:24:04,490
They're right here.

6278
03:24:05,050 --> 03:24:07,190
Yeah, we're gonna kill these dudes.

6279
03:24:09,150 --> 03:24:10,490
He's fucking running.

6280
03:24:11,330 --> 03:24:12,530
Stop running, bitch!

6281
03:24:12,790 --> 03:24:13,450
Stop running!

6282
03:24:18,440 --> 03:24:19,400
Oh my god.

6283
03:24:22,100 --> 03:24:22,620
Oh shit.

6284
03:24:22,620 --> 03:24:23,060
I'm gonna reload.

6285
03:24:23,500 --> 03:24:24,140
We're good.

6286
03:24:25,420 --> 03:24:27,760
I don't have an angle on them.

6287
03:24:28,680 --> 03:24:30,160
These guys are just kinda...

6288
03:24:30,160 --> 03:24:32,260
They're just being really annoying out there.

6289
03:24:32,580 --> 03:24:34,800
There's people behind us, I think.

6290
03:24:34,840 --> 03:24:35,600
There's people behind us?

6291
03:24:37,100 --> 03:24:38,040
Yeah, they're gloving away.

6292
03:24:38,160 --> 03:24:40,680
I might be fucked then.

6293
03:24:40,880 --> 03:24:41,900
No, we good.

6294
03:24:42,540 --> 03:24:43,240
I'm looking back.

6295
03:24:43,480 --> 03:24:44,940
I'm gonna run back the way that we came.

6296
03:24:45,620 --> 03:24:46,080
Okay.

6297
03:24:47,080 --> 03:24:48,940
Because I might...

6298
03:24:49,420 --> 03:24:49,940
I'm looking.

6299
03:24:50,080 --> 03:24:50,560
Help me.

6300
03:24:51,780 --> 03:24:53,300
Oh, he's so low.

6301
03:24:53,560 --> 03:24:54,140
I knocked him.

6302
03:24:56,000 --> 03:24:56,700
Where's his buddy?

6303
03:24:57,760 --> 03:24:58,820
Oh, I'm gonna come to you.

6304
03:24:59,140 --> 03:25:00,580
John Cena's gonna live!

6305
03:25:02,560 --> 03:25:04,180
John Cena did not live.

6306
03:25:05,120 --> 03:25:05,860
Pick up!

6307
03:25:05,860 --> 03:25:06,540
Pick me up!

6308
03:25:08,800 --> 03:25:10,640
I have bandages on me.

6309
03:25:13,260 --> 03:25:13,740
I have bandages on me.

6310
03:25:13,740 --> 03:25:13,980
Oh no.

6311
03:25:14,260 --> 03:25:15,200
John Cena, please.

6312
03:25:15,580 --> 03:25:16,440
We're gonna lose.

6313
03:25:16,540 --> 03:25:17,900
I need to be the people's champion.

6314
03:25:19,100 --> 03:25:19,900
Okay, we're good.

6315
03:25:19,960 --> 03:25:20,120
We're good.

6316
03:25:20,220 --> 03:25:21,240
You can heal.

6317
03:25:21,320 --> 03:25:21,560
You can heal.

6318
03:25:21,740 --> 03:25:23,600
I have bandages.

6319
03:25:23,640 --> 03:25:24,180
I have bandages.

6320
03:25:24,420 --> 03:25:25,060
Okay, okay.

6321
03:25:25,440 --> 03:25:28,080
I'm gonna toss you.

6322
03:25:28,620 --> 03:25:29,860
Yeah, I'm gonna catch it.

6323
03:25:29,880 --> 03:25:30,400
It's like baseball.

6324
03:25:31,520 --> 03:25:32,220
Where is it?

6325
03:25:33,140 --> 03:25:34,360
I tossed it...

6326
03:25:34,360 --> 03:25:35,640
Oh my god, it's so far.

6327
03:25:37,100 --> 03:25:38,940
I'm gonna toss you a big shield.

6328
03:25:39,180 --> 03:25:40,140
Okay, got it.

6329
03:25:40,260 --> 03:25:41,080
After you're done.

6330
03:25:43,820 --> 03:25:45,040
Oh my god, we're alive.

6331
03:25:45,140 --> 03:25:46,060
We're still alive.

6332
03:25:46,340 --> 03:25:46,980
We're still healthy.

6333
03:25:47,080 --> 03:25:47,780
Oh, they're shooting.

6334
03:25:47,880 --> 03:25:48,160
They're shooting.

6335
03:25:48,440 --> 03:25:49,540
They're still shooting.

6336
03:25:49,600 --> 03:25:49,800
Damn.

6337
03:25:49,940 --> 03:25:52,020
We can full top off over here.

6338
03:25:52,300 --> 03:25:53,800
Let's go back over to the train station.

6339
03:25:54,780 --> 03:25:56,520
And then we're gonna top off.

6340
03:25:56,740 --> 03:25:57,100
Let's go!

6341
03:25:57,860 --> 03:25:58,740
Let's fucking go!

6342
03:25:59,940 --> 03:26:02,380
John Cena wants to eat everything.

6343
03:26:02,540 --> 03:26:03,140
I think.

6344
03:26:03,140 --> 03:26:04,840
This is legal, by the way.

6345
03:26:04,960 --> 03:26:05,580
This is legal.

6346
03:26:05,740 --> 03:26:06,920
I'm drinking legal stuff.

6347
03:26:08,640 --> 03:26:10,200
Oh shit, we're out of bigs here.

6348
03:26:10,340 --> 03:26:11,520
I have heals.

6349
03:26:11,600 --> 03:26:12,320
I have gold.

6350
03:26:12,800 --> 03:26:13,320
Oh, you do?

6351
03:26:13,520 --> 03:26:13,840
Yeah.

6352
03:26:14,340 --> 03:26:15,540
Okay, pop another one then.

6353
03:26:15,680 --> 03:26:16,920
Oh, it's out of stock.

6354
03:26:17,260 --> 03:26:18,740
Oh, I thought you meant like...

6355
03:26:18,740 --> 03:26:21,040
I thought you meant like... that's...

6356
03:26:21,040 --> 03:26:22,500
Yeah, I was gonna like...

6357
03:26:23,080 --> 03:26:24,320
See, you call them shield bads too.

6358
03:26:24,480 --> 03:26:25,760
I fucking call them shield bads.

6359
03:26:26,640 --> 03:26:27,440
Oh, wait.

6360
03:26:27,600 --> 03:26:28,280
They're coming over.

6361
03:26:30,540 --> 03:26:31,520
What the fuck?

6362
03:26:31,800 --> 03:26:32,640
Are they driving you?

6363
03:26:32,760 --> 03:26:33,020
Yeah.

6364
03:26:33,140 --> 03:26:35,320
They have a machine gun on top.

6365
03:26:36,040 --> 03:26:37,760
Oh, they're gonna keep running, I think.

6366
03:26:39,520 --> 03:26:40,980
What the fuck is wrong with you?

6367
03:26:41,180 --> 03:26:41,960
Oh, they're gone.

6368
03:26:42,040 --> 03:26:42,800
They're gone.

6369
03:26:42,860 --> 03:26:43,260
They're gone.

6370
03:26:44,180 --> 03:26:47,020
I thought it was a drive-by.

6371
03:26:48,120 --> 03:26:49,960
Alright, well, I guess we can keep looting here.

6372
03:26:50,140 --> 03:26:50,600
I guess we can keep looting here.

6373
03:26:50,600 --> 03:26:51,800
I can't believe we don't have any movement.

6374
03:26:52,480 --> 03:26:54,540
There's actually so many movement items in this game.

6375
03:26:54,780 --> 03:26:55,580
Yeah, like what kind?

6376
03:26:56,300 --> 03:26:57,680
They have these gloves.

6377
03:26:58,140 --> 03:26:59,120
Oh, the Magneto?

6378
03:27:00,100 --> 03:27:01,260
They have the Magneto gloves.

6379
03:27:03,540 --> 03:27:04,020
Oh!

6380
03:27:06,300 --> 03:27:07,380
Oh, they came back.

6381
03:27:07,700 --> 03:27:08,960
They're leaving!

6382
03:27:09,360 --> 03:27:09,840
No!

6383
03:27:12,500 --> 03:27:13,600
Where are they shooting at?

6384
03:27:13,640 --> 03:27:15,320
The wacky inflatable guys over here.

6385
03:27:17,060 --> 03:27:17,540
The wacky inflatable guys over here.

6386
03:27:17,540 --> 03:27:18,120
Alright, well...

6387
03:27:19,100 --> 03:27:20,400
Let's try to find...

6388
03:27:20,400 --> 03:27:22,140
I wanna like top off on heals.

6389
03:27:22,300 --> 03:27:22,920
I can't find any.

6390
03:27:23,080 --> 03:27:24,460
Yeah, I can't find any either.

6391
03:27:25,460 --> 03:27:26,540
Is there any down here?

6392
03:27:26,640 --> 03:27:27,260
I only found like bullets.

6393
03:27:28,240 --> 03:27:29,360
Wait, what gun is that?

6394
03:27:30,220 --> 03:27:30,700
Laser rifle.

6395
03:27:30,700 --> 03:27:32,200
Oh my god, this place is so dry.

6396
03:27:33,320 --> 03:27:34,980
I got distracted into every match?

6397
03:27:35,580 --> 03:27:35,920
Woah.

6398
03:27:36,440 --> 03:27:37,540
Oh, that thing's hitscan.

6399
03:27:39,400 --> 03:27:40,680
That's what I like to hear.

6400
03:27:44,280 --> 03:27:45,120
Where do we go?

6401
03:27:46,420 --> 03:27:47,160
Let's go...

6402
03:27:47,640 --> 03:27:48,560
Let's go this way.

6403
03:27:48,980 --> 03:27:49,780
Oh, I can't ping.

6404
03:27:50,220 --> 03:27:52,940
Alright, well, the ping system sucks, but I'm trying to ping over here.

6405
03:27:53,560 --> 03:27:54,560
I'm just gonna follow.

6406
03:27:54,740 --> 03:27:55,360
I follow.

6407
03:27:55,360 --> 03:27:57,260
Let's go John Cena.

6408
03:27:57,460 --> 03:27:58,560
John Cena.

6409
03:27:58,660 --> 03:27:59,400
Don't worry.

6410
03:27:59,640 --> 03:28:01,140
John Cena never dies!

6411
03:28:02,160 --> 03:28:03,240
Kaleigh, Brenna, Nitro.

6412
03:28:03,260 --> 03:28:03,740
Do you have Nitros?

6413
03:28:03,900 --> 03:28:04,180
Yeah.

6414
03:28:04,420 --> 03:28:05,240
Okay, cool.

6415
03:28:05,720 --> 03:28:07,920
Oh my god, we can run on water!

6416
03:28:07,980 --> 03:28:08,520
We're Jesus!

6417
03:28:10,340 --> 03:28:11,540
Oh my god!

6418
03:28:15,600 --> 03:28:17,560
Just like Jesus, my hero.

6419
03:28:22,040 --> 03:28:24,620
I fucking knew he was Jesus.

6420
03:28:26,980 --> 03:28:29,140
The almighty, powerful dug-on to Simgun.

6421
03:28:30,080 --> 03:28:31,120
Oh wait, more Nitros?

6422
03:28:31,360 --> 03:28:32,780
Uh, there's Nitros in here if you need.

6423
03:28:33,220 --> 03:28:33,540
Nice.

6424
03:28:33,560 --> 03:28:34,700
Okay, what is this?

6425
03:28:35,840 --> 03:28:36,520
There's a repair?

6426
03:28:36,780 --> 03:28:37,540
Oh, that's for the car.

6427
03:28:38,240 --> 03:28:38,560
Yeah.

6428
03:28:39,520 --> 03:28:41,000
Uh, we can actually drive...

6429
03:28:41,000 --> 03:28:42,120
Oh, here, I got an idea.

6430
03:28:42,320 --> 03:28:43,380
We're gonna try to get some movement.

6431
03:28:43,660 --> 03:28:45,520
Grab those Nitros.

6432
03:28:46,400 --> 03:28:46,880
Which one?

6433
03:28:48,920 --> 03:28:50,580
Oh, I don't know why he keeps picking up the shotgun.

6434
03:28:51,060 --> 03:28:51,760
Yeah, I got it.

6435
03:28:52,340 --> 03:28:53,500
Okay, I'm trying to un-ping that.

6436
03:28:53,660 --> 03:28:54,140
Okay, there we go.

6437
03:28:54,220 --> 03:28:54,860
We're in the cart.

6438
03:28:55,420 --> 03:28:55,860
Yeah.

6439
03:28:55,880 --> 03:28:58,100
And then let's go... let's go over here.

6440
03:28:59,680 --> 03:29:01,580
There might be some movement over here.

6441
03:29:03,740 --> 03:29:05,300
There's also stuff we can heal on.

6442
03:29:05,400 --> 03:29:05,860
Like these.

6443
03:29:06,020 --> 03:29:06,240
Okay.

6444
03:29:07,380 --> 03:29:08,240
Wait, does that heal you?

6445
03:29:08,300 --> 03:29:08,880
Oh, the cactus!

6446
03:29:09,020 --> 03:29:09,520
Yeah, it heals you!

6447
03:29:09,840 --> 03:29:10,760
Oh, wait, that's so cool!

6448
03:29:11,340 --> 03:29:14,600
Yeah, so like that, the cactus, they regen in the desert area.

6449
03:29:14,800 --> 03:29:15,020
Yeah.

6450
03:29:15,420 --> 03:29:19,600
And then, uh, desert area I think has a higher chance of, like, spawning the gloves.

6451
03:29:19,880 --> 03:29:20,320
Oh!

6452
03:29:20,860 --> 03:29:22,420
So I'm gonna check over here.

6453
03:29:23,160 --> 03:29:24,360
And see if there's anything.

6454
03:29:24,980 --> 03:29:25,340
Yeah.

6455
03:29:25,460 --> 03:29:26,580
Yeah, yeah, 16 seconds.

6456
03:29:28,740 --> 03:29:31,760
We're also pretty close to zone 2, so we don't have to, like, run for 5 ever.

6457
03:29:32,920 --> 03:29:34,300
Ooh, and a Nitro drone!

6458
03:29:34,880 --> 03:29:35,240
Okay.

6459
03:29:35,240 --> 03:29:37,280
Alright, let's get out of the cart here, and then we can just, like, run around here.

6460
03:29:37,800 --> 03:29:38,320
Let's see.

6461
03:29:39,340 --> 03:29:40,080
Oh my god.

6462
03:29:40,180 --> 03:29:41,060
This place is sick.

6463
03:29:41,720 --> 03:29:42,080
Right?

6464
03:29:42,540 --> 03:29:42,900
What the fuck?

6465
03:29:42,900 --> 03:29:44,300
These were one of the medallions falling down too.

6466
03:29:45,500 --> 03:29:46,940
This place is fucking sick!

6467
03:29:48,700 --> 03:29:49,060
Whoa!

6468
03:29:49,700 --> 03:29:51,120
What the fuck?

6469
03:29:52,220 --> 03:29:52,960
What's that?

6470
03:29:53,520 --> 03:29:54,660
Does that hurt you?

6471
03:29:55,700 --> 03:29:56,760
Uh, the flames?

6472
03:29:56,760 --> 03:29:57,640
No, they launch you up.

6473
03:29:58,200 --> 03:29:59,060
Oh, the flames?

6474
03:29:59,200 --> 03:30:01,020
No, I'm talking about the fucking spinning.

6475
03:30:01,960 --> 03:30:03,860
Oh, the blades or whatever?

6476
03:30:04,060 --> 03:30:04,460
Oh my god!

6477
03:30:04,520 --> 03:30:05,520
I got a house!

6478
03:30:06,020 --> 03:30:06,980
You got a house?

6479
03:30:07,100 --> 03:30:07,900
I got a house.

6480
03:30:08,320 --> 03:30:09,060
It's happening.

6481
03:30:09,060 --> 03:30:11,160
It's over for the fucking over.

6482
03:30:14,680 --> 03:30:16,720
Okay, there's, like, no movement anywhere.

6483
03:30:16,860 --> 03:30:17,580
We have real estate.

6484
03:30:19,620 --> 03:30:21,480
Alright, well, at least we ran through there.

6485
03:30:21,920 --> 03:30:22,220
Oh.

6486
03:30:24,780 --> 03:30:26,300
This is what we're gonna be playing on tomorrow.

6487
03:30:26,860 --> 03:30:27,760
Okay, oh, this map?

6488
03:30:28,000 --> 03:30:29,320
So people are just gonna...

6489
03:30:29,320 --> 03:30:30,920
Wait, did you claim a spot for tomorrow?

6490
03:30:32,420 --> 03:30:33,060
Uh, no.

6491
03:30:33,540 --> 03:30:35,040
Wait, can we actually claim those right now?

6492
03:30:35,280 --> 03:30:35,760
I don't remember.

6493
03:30:36,460 --> 03:30:37,480
We gotta look at the rules.

6494
03:30:38,040 --> 03:30:40,140
Yeah, I'll look at the rules and then I'll see if I can claim something.

6495
03:30:40,480 --> 03:30:40,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6496
03:30:42,260 --> 03:30:43,540
Am I basically a VTuber?

6497
03:30:43,660 --> 03:30:44,720
No, I'm a werewolf IRL.

6498
03:30:45,120 --> 03:30:45,860
He's a werewolf.

6499
03:30:45,900 --> 03:30:52,620
He used to be, when I met Doryu, he used to be a fleshy, and he got bit by a wolf in between, so I don't know.

6500
03:30:53,000 --> 03:30:55,080
I was like, yo, being a fleshy is cringe.

6501
03:30:55,180 --> 03:30:57,820
He got bit by a wolf, so now he's a werewolf.

6502
03:30:59,240 --> 03:31:04,060
I know a wolf that also knows a wolf, and then they also know another wolf.

6503
03:31:04,560 --> 03:31:05,740
Wait, are they all werewolves?

6504
03:31:05,780 --> 03:31:08,180
These things also are gonna give us the nitro, too.

6505
03:31:08,420 --> 03:31:08,840
Oh, shit.

6506
03:31:09,720 --> 03:31:10,780
Nice, we're super fast.

6507
03:31:11,300 --> 03:31:13,320
And then, uh, do you want the shockwaves?

6508
03:31:13,360 --> 03:31:14,300
Do you wanna keep practicing with those?

6509
03:31:14,960 --> 03:31:15,800
No, I'm good.

6510
03:31:16,300 --> 03:31:16,680
Okay.

6511
03:31:17,460 --> 03:31:18,800
I've already mastered it.

6512
03:31:21,040 --> 03:31:22,460
I didn't need any more.

6513
03:31:23,780 --> 03:31:24,920
There's a tourney coming up?

6514
03:31:25,160 --> 03:31:26,860
Uh, so we're doing day two of the tourney.

6515
03:31:26,940 --> 03:31:30,140
Today was, uh, day one, and then tomorrow's day two.

6516
03:31:30,600 --> 03:31:32,260
But we were doing on, uh, reload.

6517
03:31:32,580 --> 03:31:32,960
Yeah.

6518
03:31:33,080 --> 03:31:34,060
I thought...

6519
03:31:34,460 --> 03:31:36,740
I thought day two was when you qualify.

6520
03:31:38,400 --> 03:31:40,160
We did qualify, we were just zoning.

6521
03:31:40,420 --> 03:31:41,060
Oh, it's true, true.

6522
03:31:41,140 --> 03:31:42,560
Guys, we qualified for day two.

6523
03:31:42,600 --> 03:31:43,920
That's how good we are, guys.

6524
03:31:44,560 --> 03:31:45,640
Oh, you wanna get the bomb?

6525
03:31:45,640 --> 03:31:47,620
Only 24 teams can qualify to day two.

6526
03:31:47,900 --> 03:31:48,840
And we made it.

6527
03:31:49,480 --> 03:31:50,020
Wait, what?

6528
03:31:50,300 --> 03:31:52,360
Hey, so you don't take fall damage with this either.

6529
03:31:52,580 --> 03:31:52,900
Yeah.

6530
03:31:52,940 --> 03:31:53,960
So you just jump from here.

6531
03:31:54,560 --> 03:31:56,140
And there's Baja Blast down here.

6532
03:31:56,400 --> 03:31:57,600
Oh, there's Baja Blast?

6533
03:31:57,660 --> 03:31:58,240
What does it do?

6534
03:31:58,520 --> 03:31:59,340
Yeah, like walk into it.

6535
03:31:59,480 --> 03:32:00,440
And then look what you do.

6536
03:32:01,220 --> 03:32:02,500
What the fuck?

6537
03:32:02,520 --> 03:32:03,660
You literally become Tracer.

6538
03:32:03,880 --> 03:32:05,180
Wait, how did you do that?

6539
03:32:05,660 --> 03:32:06,800
Uh, it's a double jump.

6540
03:32:07,540 --> 03:32:07,940
Whoa!

6541
03:32:09,420 --> 03:32:13,020
And every time you touch the Baja Blast, you just get, uh, you get the dashes.

6542
03:32:14,200 --> 03:32:15,480
Wait, how long does it last?

6543
03:32:15,900 --> 03:32:16,840
Uh, it lasts forever.

6544
03:32:16,980 --> 03:32:18,780
It'll stay on you as long as you have the charges.

6545
03:32:19,440 --> 03:32:20,940
So, you only get three charges.

6546
03:32:21,360 --> 03:32:21,520
Oh!

6547
03:32:22,680 --> 03:32:23,960
Okay, Baja Blast time.

6548
03:32:25,400 --> 03:32:26,940
Dude, Fortnite changed so much.

6549
03:32:27,100 --> 03:32:28,000
I know, right?

6550
03:32:29,740 --> 03:32:31,580
Wait, there's someone here?

6551
03:32:36,340 --> 03:32:36,700
Where?

6552
03:32:36,820 --> 03:32:37,160
Knocked one?

6553
03:32:37,380 --> 03:32:38,620
I knocked a Wolfman!

6554
03:32:39,020 --> 03:32:39,760
Where is he?

6555
03:32:39,800 --> 03:32:40,120
Where is he?

6556
03:32:40,460 --> 03:32:41,120
I killed him.

6557
03:32:41,180 --> 03:32:41,480
I killed him.

6558
03:32:41,600 --> 03:32:41,840
No!

6559
03:32:41,960 --> 03:32:42,800
I don't know where Sivir is, though.

6560
03:32:42,800 --> 03:32:43,640
Where's his teammate?

6561
03:32:45,560 --> 03:32:46,860
You think you can get away?

6562
03:32:47,440 --> 03:32:49,560
I fucking have Baja Blast.

6563
03:32:53,760 --> 03:32:54,820
Yeah, tell him!

6564
03:32:56,020 --> 03:32:56,880
Fuck him up!

6565
03:32:57,080 --> 03:32:57,740
Yeah, that's right.

6566
03:32:57,860 --> 03:32:58,960
Oh my god, he has Nuka-Cola?

6567
03:32:59,420 --> 03:33:01,460
What the fuck has the Nuka-Cola done?

6568
03:33:02,140 --> 03:33:08,100
Uh, so that does, um, it heals 75 shields, and then I think it heals, like, 50 HP.

6569
03:33:08,200 --> 03:33:08,900
I think?

6570
03:33:09,140 --> 03:33:10,080
What the fuck?

6571
03:33:10,360 --> 03:33:11,800
What is Father doing here?

6572
03:33:12,860 --> 03:33:13,360
Yeah.

6573
03:33:15,360 --> 03:33:16,480
They have Fallen?

6574
03:33:16,660 --> 03:33:18,380
When will they have Doki Bird?

6575
03:33:19,720 --> 03:33:20,460
They're throwing.

6576
03:33:20,560 --> 03:33:21,780
They gotta, they gotta add Doki.

6577
03:33:23,620 --> 03:33:24,700
So, what's that?

6578
03:33:24,860 --> 03:33:28,480
We need to teleport you over here, Mixxy.

6579
03:33:28,720 --> 03:33:29,980
We're gonna teleport you to NA.

6580
03:33:30,540 --> 03:33:31,740
Where, where is...

6581
03:33:31,740 --> 03:33:32,960
I hear gunshots.

6582
03:33:33,880 --> 03:33:35,520
Uh, gunshots are on top of the hill?

6583
03:33:35,680 --> 03:33:37,840
They're over... here.

6584
03:33:38,160 --> 03:33:38,700
Let's go.

6585
03:33:39,320 --> 03:33:40,500
Alright, let's fucking get it.

6586
03:33:40,500 --> 03:33:40,680
Let's go.

6587
03:33:40,760 --> 03:33:41,380
I don't like them.

6588
03:33:41,680 --> 03:33:42,400
I don't like them.

6589
03:33:42,800 --> 03:33:43,900
I don't like them either.

6590
03:33:44,260 --> 03:33:45,440
I don't even see what they look like, but I definitely do.

6591
03:33:45,440 --> 03:33:46,280
Yeah, I don't like them.

6592
03:33:46,740 --> 03:33:47,940
I'm gonna kill them right now.

6593
03:33:50,420 --> 03:33:51,680
They're in my lobby.

6594
03:33:51,800 --> 03:33:52,800
I already hate them.

6595
03:33:55,340 --> 03:33:56,520
I'm gonna nitro here.

6596
03:33:57,140 --> 03:33:57,580
Where?

6597
03:33:58,180 --> 03:33:59,400
Can we run up here?

6598
03:33:59,780 --> 03:34:00,160
Yeah.

6599
03:34:00,200 --> 03:34:01,260
Oh, what the hell?

6600
03:34:01,280 --> 03:34:02,700
My character is teleporting.

6601
03:34:03,040 --> 03:34:03,920
Whoa, whoa.

6602
03:34:04,760 --> 03:34:05,880
Alright, I'm gonna nitro this again.

6603
03:34:07,160 --> 03:34:07,940
And then...

6604
03:34:07,940 --> 03:34:08,980
I don't think we can.

6605
03:34:08,980 --> 03:34:09,540
I'm gonna shop it.

6606
03:34:10,180 --> 03:34:10,620
No!

6607
03:34:11,480 --> 03:34:11,980
No!

6608
03:34:12,760 --> 03:34:14,000
Oh, did I shockwave you off?

6609
03:34:15,060 --> 03:34:18,000
Did I shockwave you away?

6610
03:34:18,140 --> 03:34:18,300
No!

6611
03:34:18,540 --> 03:34:20,780
They ran the baby away.

6612
03:34:21,680 --> 03:34:22,120
Oh my.

6613
03:34:24,260 --> 03:34:25,040
I'm coming down.

6614
03:34:25,140 --> 03:34:25,460
I'm coming down.

6615
03:34:25,540 --> 03:34:25,780
I'm coming down.

6616
03:34:25,780 --> 03:34:26,560
These guys are...

6617
03:34:26,560 --> 03:34:29,060
No, they are hand-holding like crazy.

6618
03:34:32,460 --> 03:34:33,860
Moments before disaster.

6619
03:34:35,980 --> 03:34:38,440
These guys have all the movement.

6620
03:34:38,560 --> 03:34:40,060
And I'm just a little dude.

6621
03:34:40,620 --> 03:34:41,780
I'm just like, they have...

6622
03:34:42,740 --> 03:34:43,940
They're hand-holding.

6623
03:34:43,940 --> 03:34:46,660
I looked at them and I died so fast.

6624
03:34:47,600 --> 03:34:48,480
Holy shit.

6625
03:34:48,740 --> 03:34:50,020
I am going to...

6626
03:34:50,420 --> 03:34:52,640
Yeah, I can grab your card.

6627
03:34:52,720 --> 03:34:53,160
I can grab your card.

6628
03:34:54,360 --> 03:34:55,460
What is this teleport?

6629
03:34:55,480 --> 03:34:56,920
I keep lying teleporting.

6630
03:34:59,180 --> 03:35:01,860
I died so fast.

6631
03:35:02,320 --> 03:35:07,500
Yeah, I literally was up here, about to fight one of them, and then they literally both handheld on me.

6632
03:35:07,560 --> 03:35:09,020
I was like, what is happening right now?

6633
03:35:11,660 --> 03:35:12,300
It's okay.

6634
03:35:12,440 --> 03:35:13,740
I have 200 seconds.

6635
03:35:15,100 --> 03:35:16,040
I got you.

6636
03:35:16,240 --> 03:35:17,280
You got me.

6637
03:35:17,340 --> 03:35:18,400
I have Nitro too.

6638
03:35:18,520 --> 03:35:19,180
I have Nitro.

6639
03:35:19,540 --> 03:35:20,880
Get my Discord Nitro.

6640
03:35:21,300 --> 03:35:22,720
I got your Discord Nitro.

6641
03:35:22,800 --> 03:35:23,740
We're going to live this.

6642
03:35:24,060 --> 03:35:24,500
Oh my god.

6643
03:35:26,520 --> 03:35:27,480
Oh, are they fighting?

6644
03:35:28,060 --> 03:35:28,560
Yeah.

6645
03:35:29,080 --> 03:35:30,040
It's so safe.

6646
03:35:30,860 --> 03:35:31,920
It's so safe.

6647
03:35:32,200 --> 03:35:36,000
This is the slowest... This is the slowest res ever, but we're so safe.

6648
03:35:38,180 --> 03:35:38,660
No!

6649
03:35:39,820 --> 03:35:40,640
Okay, guys.

6650
03:35:40,860 --> 03:35:41,820
I'm proud of y'all.

6651
03:35:41,980 --> 03:35:42,940
Oh my god.

6652
03:35:43,000 --> 03:35:43,480
I'm proud of y'all.

6653
03:35:43,480 --> 03:35:45,200
You're fucking nerds.

6654
03:35:47,060 --> 03:35:48,020
Holy shit.

6655
03:35:48,060 --> 03:35:48,900
That movement though.

6656
03:35:49,920 --> 03:35:50,640
Oh, wait.

6657
03:35:50,660 --> 03:35:51,080
They're fighting now.

6658
03:35:51,280 --> 03:35:52,820
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

6659
03:35:53,720 --> 03:35:55,420
No, they're camping the res.

6660
03:35:56,800 --> 03:35:58,000
That's fucking right.

6661
03:35:58,120 --> 03:35:58,600
Die.

6662
03:36:01,440 --> 03:36:01,920
Where?

6663
03:36:02,020 --> 03:36:02,760
Is this guy above?

6664
03:36:06,060 --> 03:36:06,940
Oh, I see them.

6665
03:36:06,980 --> 03:36:07,740
Oh, they thirsted him.

6666
03:36:08,280 --> 03:36:09,980
Wait, is that medallion good?

6667
03:36:10,560 --> 03:36:12,600
Uh, it gives me unlimited ammo.

6668
03:36:13,680 --> 03:36:14,460
But, uh...

6669
03:36:15,140 --> 03:36:17,480
I don't think it's going to be what will save him.

6670
03:36:18,200 --> 03:36:19,320
Oh, the glass!

6671
03:36:19,600 --> 03:36:20,120
Is that good?

6672
03:36:20,480 --> 03:36:21,260
Yeah, it's good.

6673
03:36:21,360 --> 03:36:21,520
It's good.

6674
03:36:21,540 --> 03:36:21,640
It's good.

6675
03:36:21,760 --> 03:36:22,680
Holy shit.

6676
03:36:22,720 --> 03:36:24,100
What is this movement?

6677
03:36:25,500 --> 03:36:26,820
What the fuck?

6678
03:36:27,380 --> 03:36:30,920
You literally traveled across the map in one second.

6679
03:36:31,220 --> 03:36:31,660
Right?

6680
03:36:31,800 --> 03:36:33,860
I told you the movement in the other freaking...

6681
03:36:33,860 --> 03:36:36,360
The other mode is so cursed.

6682
03:36:37,280 --> 03:36:37,980
Oh, no.

6683
03:36:38,080 --> 03:36:38,440
This...

6684
03:36:38,440 --> 03:36:39,760
This is going to be tomorrow.

6685
03:36:41,460 --> 03:36:42,940
Oh, we are...

6686
03:36:42,940 --> 03:36:45,660
This is going to be tomorrow.

6687
03:36:46,080 --> 03:36:47,060
Oh, I get it.

6688
03:36:47,060 --> 03:36:47,520
I get it.

6689
03:36:47,520 --> 03:36:48,040
I'm proud of you.

6690
03:36:48,440 --> 03:36:49,540
I'm proud of you, dude.

6691
03:36:49,640 --> 03:36:49,900
Oh, no.

6692
03:36:52,100 --> 03:36:52,540
Wait.

6693
03:36:52,760 --> 03:36:54,520
Is the hands going to exist tomorrow?

6694
03:36:55,320 --> 03:36:55,840
Uh, yeah.

6695
03:36:55,880 --> 03:36:56,500
I think so.

6696
03:36:56,660 --> 03:36:57,580
Oh, no.

6697
03:37:00,780 --> 03:37:01,660
Oh, no.

6698
03:37:02,760 --> 03:37:03,060
Oh, no.

6699
03:37:04,620 --> 03:37:06,120
Oh, my God.

6700
03:37:06,220 --> 03:37:08,900
It took the whole game to find gloves.

6701
03:37:09,320 --> 03:37:10,860
Holy shit.

6702
03:37:11,380 --> 03:37:12,700
Oh, my God.

6703
03:37:12,920 --> 03:37:14,140
Oh, my God.

6704
03:37:14,240 --> 03:37:17,660
We got to... We got to deal with that tomorrow?

6705
03:37:19,220 --> 03:37:19,700
Yup.

6706
03:37:19,700 --> 03:37:20,180
Yup.

6707
03:37:23,420 --> 03:37:24,380
Oh, wait.

6708
03:37:24,440 --> 03:37:26,640
They said hands are not in rank nor are cars.

6709
03:37:26,980 --> 03:37:27,600
Oh, thank God.

6710
03:37:27,620 --> 03:37:28,060
Oh, okay.

6711
03:37:28,140 --> 03:37:28,860
So they're not going to have that.

6712
03:37:28,860 --> 03:37:29,540
Oh, thank God.

6713
03:37:29,640 --> 03:37:29,880
Okay.

6714
03:37:30,020 --> 03:37:30,420
That's...

6715
03:37:30,420 --> 03:37:30,860
Thank God.

6716
03:37:30,940 --> 03:37:31,240
Okay.

6717
03:37:33,240 --> 03:37:33,760
Oh.

6718
03:37:34,660 --> 03:37:37,380
I really... I don't think I would like to play.

6719
03:37:37,620 --> 03:37:39,240
I don't think I'll have fun.

6720
03:37:40,580 --> 03:37:41,620
With the pros?

6721
03:37:42,180 --> 03:37:43,660
The pros with the hands?

6722
03:37:43,820 --> 03:37:44,680
I don't know.

6723
03:37:45,280 --> 03:37:47,000
Oh, don't... You got hands.

6724
03:37:47,160 --> 03:37:48,020
That's what they don't have.

6725
03:37:48,180 --> 03:37:49,180
They don't have hands.

6726
03:37:49,560 --> 03:37:50,600
Oh, Jesus Christ.

6727
03:37:50,640 --> 03:37:51,660
Thank fucking God.

6728
03:37:51,900 --> 03:37:52,420
GG's.

6729
03:37:52,420 --> 03:37:52,840
I had fun.

6730
03:37:53,220 --> 03:37:54,240
GG's, Dokie.

6731
03:37:54,480 --> 03:37:56,100
What a great day one.

6732
03:37:56,240 --> 03:37:58,400
Thanks for dropping by, like...

6733
03:37:58,400 --> 03:37:58,880
Yeah.

6734
03:37:58,880 --> 03:38:00,800
Like an hour before the tournament.

6735
03:38:01,120 --> 03:38:02,580
I really appreciate it.

6736
03:38:02,580 --> 03:38:03,100
That's a blast.

6737
03:38:03,200 --> 03:38:11,480
Like, I was actually joking with my boyfriend about how, like, I have this luck with Fortnite where I will always get pulled into something very last second.

6738
03:38:11,700 --> 03:38:12,900
And I'm like, you know what?

6739
03:38:13,280 --> 03:38:14,000
Fuck it.

6740
03:38:14,060 --> 03:38:14,380
We fall.

6741
03:38:14,600 --> 03:38:16,260
I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna go all in.

6742
03:38:16,360 --> 03:38:16,960
Fuck it.

6743
03:38:17,140 --> 03:38:17,840
Fuck it.

6744
03:38:18,060 --> 03:38:19,580
Oh, thank God.

6745
03:38:19,760 --> 03:38:20,160
Yeah.

6746
03:38:20,500 --> 03:38:21,340
Thank God.

6747
03:38:21,740 --> 03:38:22,220
GG's.

6748
03:38:23,160 --> 03:38:24,120
GG's, Dokie.

6749
03:38:24,560 --> 03:38:25,820
Yeah, I'll see you day two.

6750
03:38:25,920 --> 03:38:27,060
I miss your face.

6751
03:38:28,460 --> 03:38:29,880
It's been a long time.

6752
03:38:32,080 --> 03:38:32,800
It's really...

6753
03:38:32,800 --> 03:38:34,580
Yeah, let me know if you want to, like, play a bit, too.

6754
03:38:34,640 --> 03:38:36,180
Like, before the tournament or whatever.

6755
03:38:36,320 --> 03:38:36,340
Yeah, yeah.

6756
03:38:36,340 --> 03:38:36,760
I think I do.

6757
03:38:36,820 --> 03:38:38,120
I think I definitely need to warm up.

6758
03:38:39,620 --> 03:38:40,200
I will.

6759
03:38:40,280 --> 03:38:41,620
I'll figure out how to drop spawn stuff, too.

6760
03:38:41,820 --> 03:38:42,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6761
03:38:43,060 --> 03:38:43,420
Alright.

6762
03:38:43,580 --> 03:38:44,420
I'll see you later.

6763
03:38:45,400 --> 03:38:45,760
Alright.

6764
03:38:45,920 --> 03:38:46,800
Bye, Dokie.

6765
03:38:46,960 --> 03:38:47,320
Bye.

6766
03:38:47,320 --> 03:38:47,600
Bye.

6767
03:38:47,600 --> 03:38:48,380
I adore you.

6768
03:38:48,760 --> 03:38:49,120
Bye.

6769
03:38:49,360 --> 03:38:50,480
Bye, everyone in Dokie's chat.

6770
03:38:50,780 --> 03:38:51,940
Bye, everybody in Dory's chat.

6771
03:38:53,960 --> 03:38:55,000
Oh, my God.

6772
03:38:55,520 --> 03:38:56,420
That was so fun.

6773
03:38:56,540 --> 03:38:57,460
I had a fun time.

6774
03:38:57,460 --> 03:38:58,800
Um, being...

6775
03:38:58,800 --> 03:39:02,260
Like, just playing with Doryu and just, like, being dragged around.

6776
03:39:04,340 --> 03:39:08,040
I realized, wow, Fortnite changed so much.

6777
03:39:09,900 --> 03:39:12,880
Um, thank you, everybody, for watching.

6778
03:39:13,020 --> 03:39:17,900
I guess tomorrow, also, we're going to be playing Fortnite tomorrow for day two.

6779
03:39:18,600 --> 03:39:22,500
Um, so, uh, there's going to be more of the tournament with Doryu.

6780
03:39:22,800 --> 03:39:26,640
Uh, so if you guys want to check it out, it's going to be same time, 2 p.m.

6781
03:39:26,640 --> 03:39:27,040
PST.

6782
03:39:27,460 --> 03:39:28,620
Uh, on Twitch.

6783
03:39:29,060 --> 03:39:30,820
Um, it always happens.

6784
03:39:30,940 --> 03:39:37,540
Every time, like, I'm resting, uh, there's a Twitch Rivals tournament that I get invited to, which I think it's... it's happened a lot.

6785
03:39:37,780 --> 03:39:39,100
I realize...

6786
03:39:39,100 --> 03:39:42,720
I realize it has happened frequently, quite a lot.

6787
03:39:42,760 --> 03:39:43,720
Like, it's a pattern.

6788
03:39:46,100 --> 03:39:47,960
But... but it's been really fun.

6789
03:39:48,240 --> 03:39:49,460
I've been having a great time.

6790
03:39:49,680 --> 03:39:51,200
Um, just wanted to...

6791
03:39:51,200 --> 03:39:54,740
Um, I haven't talked to Doryu in a long, long time, I think.

6792
03:39:54,800 --> 03:39:55,100
Yeah.

6793
03:39:55,200 --> 03:39:57,080
Like I said, I knew him back in Apex.

6794
03:39:57,460 --> 03:40:01,380
Um, he was, uh, still, like, a fleshy.

6795
03:40:01,580 --> 03:40:03,260
Uh, now he's a werewolf.

6796
03:40:04,080 --> 03:40:06,040
Now I have a werewolf bodyguard.

6797
03:40:07,880 --> 03:40:16,100
Um, but I'm glad that... I'm glad that, like, we had somebody to play... play Fort... like, do this Twitch Rivals with.

6798
03:40:16,240 --> 03:40:26,820
Cause like I said, we went through, like, three different Fortnite pros, and then I'm so happy that Doryu was able to, like, uh, sub in at super fucking last minute for us.

6799
03:40:27,480 --> 03:40:31,740
Um, and, uh, like, and with Twitch staff helping us too.

6800
03:40:32,020 --> 03:40:33,140
Uh, but yeah!

6801
03:40:33,560 --> 03:40:35,840
I really appreciate everybody for coming in!

6802
03:40:36,020 --> 03:40:37,640
If you guys don't know me, my name is DokiBird.

6803
03:40:37,800 --> 03:40:43,500
Um, I usually stream on YouTubes, but today I am on Twitch for the tournament, usually for Twitch Rivals.

6804
03:40:43,680 --> 03:40:48,540
I am, uh, on Twitch for Twitch Rivals, so please check me on YouTube.

6805
03:40:48,880 --> 03:40:52,620
Um, you guys wanna know whenever I stream on... on Twitch, please follow me on Twitter.

6806
03:40:52,820 --> 03:40:54,940
Uh, we have a lot of promo stuff.

6807
03:40:55,060 --> 03:40:55,280
We have...

6808
03:40:55,280 --> 03:40:56,900
you guys know my gamer subcode?

6809
03:40:57,180 --> 03:41:01,100
Uh, check... you wanna support me via other means?

6810
03:41:01,220 --> 03:41:03,360
I have so many other ways to support me from...

6811
03:41:03,360 --> 03:41:13,600
with, like, uh, gamer subs, the Hyatt merch, the merch store, um, and thank you everybody for all the subs, the gift of subs, uh, the biddies, and the follows.

6812
03:41:13,760 --> 03:41:15,580
I really, really, really do appreciate it.

6813
03:41:15,660 --> 03:41:19,900
As always, everybody stay hydrated, pause, check it out, and move around to get that blood flowing.

6814
03:41:20,060 --> 03:41:23,260
And if you step for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it!

6815
03:41:23,360 --> 03:41:24,340
I'll see you guys next time, everybody!

6816
03:41:25,280 --> 03:41:25,620
Bye, guys!

6817
03:41:26,960 --> 03:41:27,560
Bye!
