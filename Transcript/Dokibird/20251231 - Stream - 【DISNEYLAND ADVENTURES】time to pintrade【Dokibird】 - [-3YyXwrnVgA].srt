1
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,500
Yo, bro, are you ready to go to the happiest place on earth,
guys?

2
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,680
I heard that shit is fucking fire, bro.

3
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,580
Hello, everyone.

4
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,000
Hello, hello.

5
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,560
I don't know if I'm too big on screen.

6
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,440
You guys think I'm too big, or is it just okay?

7
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,920
I don't want to, like, I don't know.

8
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,860
I don't know.

9
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,140
I haven't, like, used, like, you know, used this skin suit
yet for gameplay.

10
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,460
So I don't know, like, what is the perfect size?

11
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,160
to be on the screen.

12
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:21,900
It's perfect.

13
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,700
I'm always worried if it's like too big or not because like,
you know, oh yeah, watch this.

14
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,700
So if I ever have to go pee,

15
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,960
it just works.

16
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,260
I'm not, guys, I'm not peeing in my sleep, guys.

17
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,520
It's just, you guys, it's just, my soul is peeing right now.

18
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:53,760
just so you guys know, just so you guys, there's no trauma
associated where I have to, Wet the bed or some shit.

19
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,120
Yeah, my soul is peeing you.

20
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,360
Whenever I have to use the bathroom, I can just do this.

21
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,080
There you go.

22
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:08,860
Yeah, I don't know.

23
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,180
Is this right size or should I be smaller?

24
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,760
I always worry that like, because like, I feel like it does
take up a lot of the screen.

25
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,100
So I'm like, am I too big?

26
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,440
Am I?

27
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,540
Maybe I'll make it a little bit smaller.

28
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:21,320
Maybe.

29
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,440
Immersion.

30
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,200
Fuck your immersion right now.

31
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,880
Trying to figure it out.

32
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,580
Yeah, alright, here we go.

33
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,160
There we go.

34
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,480
This is more important right now because I always get like
really...

35
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,600
I always get like really anal about this type of shit.

36
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,190
Because I want you guys to have like a...

37
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,640
I want you guys to be able to see what the fuck is going on
too, you know?

38
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,100
Can all women astral project while peeing or is just the
case?

39
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,200

bathroom and we bring like a couple of ladies with us.

00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:17,960
they're they are un they're not dain yeah they're just
they're unhealthy which in a way is like you just slowly

165
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:26,700
like i guess like you're slowly destroying your body the
more hot showers you take or some shit yeah it's not gonna

166
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:37,840
stop me i read this information and i i will continue to
take hot showers um it strips the natural oil when you take

167
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:45,280
hot showers i'll just oil myself one day someone will invent
and it will invent something where after you take your hot

168
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:50,440
shower you spray like the you spray oil on yourself and then
bam it's the same

169
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:01,180
um but yeah also i read another article i've been reading
some very interesting articles where apparently the bigger

170
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:08,140
your butt than more there's like a sign that you might have
autism or adhd if you have a big booty

171
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,340
Genetic sacrifices you have to make to get that booty, you
know?

172
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

173
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,880
That's crazy.

174
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,840
I know, right?

175
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,020
Like, so if you have a big booty, maybe you should get
tested.

176
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,320
Just to be safe, you know?

177
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,900
Just to be safe.

178
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:36,660
Out with actual correlation or just a relation.

179
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,600
Okay, here, I'll show you.

180
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,820
It's from the New York Post.

181
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:50,300
from some red it's not from like uh it's not like tmz or
some it's from the new york post it's not like a buzzfeed

182
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:59,740
article like literally an actual journalist an actual so you
guys got a big booty maybe get tested just in case not

183
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:09,780
autistic but at what cost yeah you're like i have a flat no
that's why i have a dude we're like no that's why i I have a

184
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,920
flat ass.

185
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:11,500
No.

186
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:21,640
Look, I know you're like, look, there's, there's a, we don't
have a big benchmark when it comes to journalism, but at

187
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,080
least it's not TMZ.

188
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,920
Your backside might reveal a thing or two about your brain.

189
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:41,240
That's, a promitosh is related to having autism or age
that's, actually fucking crazy

190
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:55,580
all right um anyway let's go to disneyland i think this is a
great i think okay so originally i wasn't gonna schedule the

191
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:01,080
disneyland the disneyland stream today i was gonna do it
tomorrow but other than i was like but it'll be really funny

192
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:08,960
like in the morning we're going to a park made for children
and then at night we play nikki i thought i thought that'd

193
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:18,620
be fucking funny so that's why I played Disney yeah
Disneyland today it's like um child friendly in the morning

194
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:28,820
freaky at night you know the whiplash yeah we're here for

195
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:36,420
Disneyland a fucking long ass time though um you saw that no
I have no idea what you guys what you're talking about yeah

196
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:41,780
I saw the fucking I only saw like the article tweet.

197
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,180
I had it bookmarked for a while because I really wanted to
give you guys like, oh my God, guys.

198
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,880
Fun fact.

199
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,920
Gabbitt, think of a super chat.

200
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,220
Thank you.

201
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:52,960
Thank you.

202
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,160
All right.

203
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,080
Let's go.

204
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,220
Oh, I saw Lady Loki.

205
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,120
I'm glad that it's not on Hella because it really looked
like a Hella skin at first.

206
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:08,860
And I'm glad they actually, apparently they made a statement
being like, this is like sort of like an almost one-time

207
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,280
thing.

208
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:17,520
because lady loki is loki so it's technically loki um and
because people were like oh my god that means we can get

209
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:25,200
like sam wilson or something as captain america or uh or we
can get like i don't know i don't know the other marvels

210
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:34,780
like you know the all other or like i guess like miles
morale at spider-man and stuff like that and uh people were

211
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:40,460
like no like i think the devs were like someone said that
the devs were like no it's sort of like a one-time thing

212
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:48,160
because lady loki is loki it's just loki being silly you
know like loki loves transforming into like different types

213
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:58,320
of things so uh uh yeah so like it's not like not like
they're gonna do it again or some but it's cool that they

214
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:12,400
made lady loki um because she's hot as she's hot as this
fuck bro yeah more goon skins people who are complaining

215
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:18,600

Man, hot man and woman, too.

221
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:55,140
They don't discriminate on who gets the...

222
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,920
Okay, wait, let me...

223
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,700
I don't know if Sound Guy is alive.

224
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,020
So let me know if this is okay.

225
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,420
Bottom, bottom.

226
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:10,460
You guys don't see it yet because I haven't shown the video.

227
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,300
Here we go.

228
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:12,580

00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,640
Can you wish me a happy birthday, please?

231
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,440
Of course, Delta.

232
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,040
Oh my gosh, why is this so small?

233
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,060
I mean, sorry, not you.

234
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,680
I'm talking about the game screen.

235
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,020
Happy birthday, Delta.

236
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,460
Happy birthday to you.

237
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,620
Happy birthday to you.

238
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,040
Happy birthday, dear Delta.

239
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,060

241
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,600
I hope you have a good birthday, Delta.

242
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,520
I'm glad that the birthday merch arrived in time.

243
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,160
Let's go to Disneyland!

244
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,980
Disney in so long!

245
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:58,160
It's also apparently the price of going to Disney is getting
higher and higher.

246
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:04,760
I said it before, but it's cheaper to go to Japan and go to
Tokyo Disneyland than it is to fucking go to California

247
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,680
Disneyland or some shit or anywhere.

248
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:14,480
Any of the Disneylands in America like way too expensive now
or like especially the quality of the food you get and ah i

249
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:22,080
think disneyland food is such a scam unless you're like
american disneyland food if you're in asia for disneyland

250
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:28,640
food it's so good uh chid thank you for the super chat thank

Slefner Loki's mechanically Thank you for the super chat

252
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:45,920
Thank you I actually knew that I read a lot of Norse
mythologies growing up So I actually knew that Loki was a

253
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:55,980
Was a I'll say this like With Not negatively Not derogatory
But Loki was a fucking slut

254
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:05,480
Non derogatory by the way He was a freaky freaky whore

255
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:17,700
He fucked everything just like Zeus But like actually No I
wouldn't say fuck it He gets He was like I will He was like

It was the world's first twink

258
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,720
Girl Girl Oh, wait, you're right.

259
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,560
Alright, Union, okay.

260
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,780
I don't know if it's too loud or not.

261
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,580
Oh, yeah, sorry.

262
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,660
Welcome to Disneyland, kids.

263
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,800
Welcome to Disneyland.

264
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,640
Wait, we gotta have...

265
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,560
Wait, no, HD.

266
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,120
We gotta have the most HD experience.

267
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,660
Alright, can it come down a little bit?

268
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,860
I don't see all the pores on this Mickey Mouse.

269
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:02,800
Okay.

270
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,640
Wait, speech.

271
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,000
Oh, yeah, by the way, this looks weird.

272
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,280
It'll be like, why does it look like you're on the Wii Wii?

273
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,760
The game was originally made for the Connect.

274
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,140
For the parent.

275
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:18,400
I guess, like, for parents who couldn't afford to take their
kids to Disneyland every fucking week, and they've been

276
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:18,940
begging to go.

277
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,320
So they just bought the Connect for their child.

278
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,600
Be like, you want to go to Disneyland?

279
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,880
You go to play this game.

280
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,100
It's just like this.

281
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,660
It's just like going to Disneyland.

282
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,500
I need subtitles, so I understand what the fuck Mickey is
saying.

283
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,360
All right, there we go.

284
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,370
Well, Disneyland is expensive, okay?

285
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:46,170
I understand the parents not wanting to buy, like, the
monthly pass.

286
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:51,510
I feel like monthly passes are for, like, or year passes are
for, like, adults, not for the children.

287
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,490
Yeah, there's literally Disneyland at home.

288
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,150
Okay, I need the sensitivity to be lower, please.

289
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,930
Yeah, it's literally, and they don't have to line up.

290
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:13,850
stand in the sun for like seven hours straight and line up

Language, you're in Disneyland.

296
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,170
The mouse has ears everywhere.

297
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,090
The mouse is already listening in.

298
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,530
They've been listening in for years now.

299
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:55,930
Gathering my data.

300
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:57,810

Donald, I 100% believe Donald over Mickey.

458
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:49,800
I think him as a character, he's, because like, Mickey is
now so sanitized because he's, like, the mascot, the face of

459
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,180
Disney, that there are two scared of giving him a
personality now.

460
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,160

When I become mayor, free park entry for everyone.

465
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,580
After a small 4.99, major convenience meet.

466

467
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,100

00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,200
Don't vote for Mickey Mouse for mayor, guys.

470
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,360
He's lying.

471
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,960
He's lying to you all.

472
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,800

So I will high-five Donald until his hands bleed.

478
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,580
The mouse only wants your money exactly.

479
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,040
All Donald wants is recognition.

480
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,460
He should have been the face of Disney.

481
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:41,600
Him!

482
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,180

00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,700
Oh hey, there's...

496
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,440
How do I... Hello.

497
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,100
Hello.

498
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,460
How do I activate this?

499
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,620
I want to get my fortune told.

500
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,100
Hello, everyone.

501
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,160
Is that John Disneyland?

502
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,660
Is that him?

503
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:26,780
Oh my god.

504
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:31,000
It's Walt Disney's soul possessing the Kinect game.

505
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,300
Oh my god.

506
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:35,840
Oh my god.

507
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:42,540
Do you think they'll take me to the basement where they
froze, cryogenically froze Walt Disney?

508
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,180
Hello.

509
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,720

00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:51,660
Yippee!

511
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,900
This autograph book's not for me.

512
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,020
Is there Goofy?

513
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,860
He outsourced.

514
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,940
Goofy outsourced to him and he outsourced to me.

515
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:05,520
And I get paid like 10-5%.

516
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,560
He takes 50.

517
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,500
I take 5.

518
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,480

00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,860

He truly, Mickey truly is the king of capitalism.

00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,000

I'm sorry.

541
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,860
Goofy, they're looking for new members in phase.

542
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:57,780
Don't want you.

543
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,780
It's not phase down, though.

544
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:04,880
They're gone.

545
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,040
Yay!

546
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,620

Can I have your autograph?

554
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,520
Remember how to spell my name.

555
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,340
Oh no, Goofy's illiterate.

556
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,580
It's okay, buddy.

00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:29,900
It's okay.

558
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,880
You still were able to smash Goofy.

559
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:39,760
Yeah!

560
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:40,940

00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:49,700
Goofy, no.

565
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,400
Good boy, pal.

Yeah, maybe he's just he's acting goofy Uh to get the ladies

568
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:31,680
After watching the latest defunct line came to conclusion
how Stitch was the first to do a B2 meeting Grief.

569
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,240
Stitch kind of your senpai now.

570
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:33,500
Thank you.

571
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,420
It was super chat, girl.

Thank you.

573
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:35,240
Thank you.

574
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,500
Stitch wasn't the first one.

575
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:43,760
I think it was, it was definitely not Stitch who did the,
like, I know what you guys are talking about.

576
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:48,340
Like, you know, like they have someone behind the screen and
then he talks to you in person.

577
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:54,540
He's not the first one in the Disneyland, for Stitch.

578
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,020
I'm trying to remember which one.

579
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,960
The turtle, yeah, was it Crash?

580
00:41:59,680 --> 00:41:59,940
Yeah.

581
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,740
Crash, it was Crash first, then Stitch.

582
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,120
A Crush.

583
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,900
For you.

584
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,560
It's your own mud for the camera.

585
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,220
If you like, you can practice taking a picture of me.

586
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,380
Was Crush after Stitch?

587
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,360
And you can take my picture.

588
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,120
Okay.

589
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,780
to talk to you.

590
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,500
Whoa, fold my feet.

591
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,420
It's magic.

592
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,280
Whoa, I have a camera.

00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:38,780
Okay, I will say, like, press R and use...

Oh, okay.

595
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,020
What?

596
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,580

597
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,220
Focus.

598
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,180
Focus M.

599
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,680
This is what he reminds me of.

600
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,360
Oh, my God.

601
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:50,780
Wait.

602
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,900
Smartphones were around?

603
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:57,400
Oh, my God.

604
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:57,780
Yay!

605
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:06,580
The youngsters were 2002 and finding memos 2003.

606
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,920
But what about the park rides?

607
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:08,760
I don't know.

608
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,020
And we're talking about the park rides of the...

609
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,640
Where the interactive park rides.

610
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,100

Wait.

00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:20,000
Oh, wait.

614
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,240
He just sounds like...

615
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,860
He does sound like Sonic, too.

616
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:23,440
You're right.

617
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,000
I wonder if that's the voice actor of Sonic.

618
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:27,260
Oh my god.

619
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,200
Wait, it's glowing.

It won't work yet.

632
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,220
You gotta go get the right album first.

00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:21,680
What?

634
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:22,740

Oh my god.

638

Welcome to Disneyland.

639
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,180
They're like, you can't take that on your phone.

640
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,680
You don't have the right album.

641
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,760
I'm like, it's my phone.

642

00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,880
That's how they get you.

648
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:52,040
I know, guys, I'm so immersed right now.

649
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:58,980
I'm not allowed to take photos unless I have the correct
album, even though I own my phone.

650
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:10,220
If you do, if you break the Disney rules, they're going to

Oh, my God.

661
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,800
It's like, it's, it's almost like Connect Game was not built
for mouse and keyboard.

662
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,120
I, I don't know.

Okay.

667
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,160
Wait, I can move with my mouse and, oh my god, it was like,
press W-O-S-D.

668
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,520
And I was like, okay, you can control it with your mouse.

669
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,720
You can, okay, that's fine.

670
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:33,140
I figured it out.

671
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,780
You apparently can control it with your fucking mouse.

672
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,160
need to use your fucking WASD.

673
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,000
As a child, it's supposed to control.

674
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,680
Okay, nice, secret.

675
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:50,000
Yes, the mouse works.

676
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:51,880
You don't need to use WASD.

677
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:53,360
Press space.

678
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:54,700
Oh, new file works.

679
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:56,920
Is it more expensive?

680
00:46:59,000 --> 00:46:59,760
Alright, nice.

681
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:00,800
Yay!

682
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,080
I did this.

683
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,100
A child did this.

684
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,680
You didn't tell this is dated because now Disney just used
drones.

685
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,200
Disney has stopped using.

686
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,380
They stopped using fireworks.

687
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:23,080
They just used drones now.

688
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:28,340
I would assume it's just cheaper than fireworks.

689
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,080
Because you can just reuse drones.

690
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,740
You literally just charge the drones.

691
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:39,160
Yeah, they use people, a lot of amusement parks just use
drones for like, for, uh, firework shows.

692
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:45,320
They do fireworks, but they also do like drone shows more.

693
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:51,300
I assume, yeah, I assume it's like cheaper to clean up too.

694
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:53,240
Yeah.

695
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:08,670
Yeah, I used to live next to an, uh, when I lived in China,
I used to live next to an amusement park in, in, uh, I don't

696
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:16,630
even know my telling, talking about, okay, so, I, it's
called like Happy Valley and like my grandparents, because I

697
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:24,610
live with my grandparents, and they live next to a Chinese
amusement park called Happy Valley, and every night at 9 p

698
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:29,070
.m., they would release the fireworks every fucking night.

699
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:34,170
And we were literally next tour to Happy Valley every night.

700
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:37,350
9 p.m.

701
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:38,170
out here.

702
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:40,610
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

703
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:51,930
I don't mind talking about, like, because, like, I moved out
of there looking years ago.

704
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:57,150
And, like, they sold the house, so, like, it's not, like,
I'm going back.

705
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:00,710
It's 9 p.m.

706
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:05,670
What an amazing show.

707
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:07,270
I'm sure...

708
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:09,490
Hey, I get my free fireworks show every day.

709
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:21,210
yeah it's cool after like you know it's cool for the first
week guys not even the first it's cool for the first day but

710
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:33,810
when it happens every day at 9 p.m sharp it suddenly gets a
little less cool and then i lived there for like two to

711
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:42,770
three years every day 9 p.m for two to three years i can't
even go to if i'm super tired doesn't matter people be like

712
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:56,990
boom boom boom it's just it's just my alarm clock a
backwards alarm clock yeah reverse alarm clock that's why

713
00:49:56,990 --> 00:50:03,470
that's why amusement parks in america are so unless you live
in the disney hotelers i know there's like there's

714
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:09,790
apparently a gated community in one of the disneyland parks
i know some people are like wow dokey you know so much about

715
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:15,430
this disneyland It's because I used to watch like TPN videos
and shit because it's so interesting where they do like

716
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:21,050
animatronic failures And I would watch like other things

759
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:14,250
I was such a, I was such a little shit as a, as a kid, I
told you guys the story, but when I was in, like, Hong Kong

760
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:23,150
Disneyland, there was Pluto, and they had, like, a buffet, a
nice, fancy buffet, Pluto came to visit me, and it was my

761
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:25,510
birthday, And then my friend was with me too.

762
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:28,210
I invited my friend to Hong Kong Disneyland and then we're
like Pluto.

763
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:29,650
Why aren't you talking Pluto, huh?

764
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:30,370
Why aren't you talking?

765
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:37,610
My friend started like I'm so sorry to the cast member there
that had to put up with us little shits Oh, we're like come

766
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:38,610
on Pluto talk.

767
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:40,190
Why aren't you talking Pluto?

768
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:49,770
I'm sorry, I'm sorry I'm sorry the cast that had to feel of
us.

769
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:51,750
But we were we were children, okay?

770
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:57,710
Yeah, but we wanted him to bark.

771
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:59,890
We're like, Pluto, bark for us, Pluto.

772
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:06,390
And then my friend was, like, touching the inside of his
mouth and was like, come on, Pluto, why aren't you barking?

773
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:07,770
Why can't you speak?

774
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:12,250
And then another cast member, another, I think it was like,
Goofy came over to save him.

775
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:16,510
And just, like, just, like, try to save him and stuff.

776
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:18,830
And then we started bullying Goofy instead.

777
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:23,030
Pluto behind the mask.

778
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:27,760
All right.

Because I'm a fucking child!

00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:53,150

811
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:43,020
It's Disneyland!

812
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:47,960
Other than Paris Disneyland though, apparently Paris
Disneyland is not looking so good right now.

813
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,320
Hello!

814
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:51,020
Snow White!

815
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:57,780
Can you sign my book?

My name is Snow White.

00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,100
I'm very pleased to meet you.

818
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:05,620
I once went, when I was a kid, I dressed up at Snow White
for Halloween.

819
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:10,560
Yay, patty cake, patty cake.

820
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:12,140
My baker's dead.

821
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:13,680
Make me a banana.

822
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:18,000
I don't remember any of the children rhymes when you do
patty cake.

823
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,620
Let's dash, no way.

824
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:23,440
Yeah.

825
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:26,660
I think, like, people are always on strike in France.

826
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:27,920
Oh, nuts.

827
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:29,460
We don't have the right autograph.

828
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,080
No!

829
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:37,960
Oh, can you just sign in my blitz?

830
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:39,240
Don't have Mickey World.

831
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:40,340
No, I swear.

832
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:43,620
I won't tell Mickey, please.

833
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,320
All right, at least I'll get a hug.

834
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:51,660
Next, see, they give us a super chat.

835
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:54,180
Really, can I get another hug then?

836
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:57,000
Yeah, Mickey sees off.

837
00:57:58,980 --> 00:57:59,400
Yeah.

838
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,580
Oh, my God, she did a little curtsy.

839
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:10,160
I think I went to Disneyland Paris, and I think my

I missed the Bitcoins there.

875
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:39,710
This isn't London.

876
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:41,950
It's Disney's London, guys.

877
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:45,090
It's Walt's Walt's Vision of London.

878
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:53,130
Yeah!

879
01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:57,590
I can't believe people would leave all these coins.

880
01:01:57,610 --> 01:01:59,710
down here in London.

881
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:03,070
Alright.

882
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:05,510
Use boost to get for it.

883
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:07,110
Can I slam myself on the pull?

884
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:07,950
Oh!

885
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:10,830
I feel like rest in peace.

886
01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:13,270
The child just didn't make it.

887
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:15,490
It's the Puggy Peter Padrat.

888
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:20,830
There you go.

889
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:23,350

890
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,240

891
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,140
Oh my god.

892
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:35,280

893
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,280
Guys, remember the...

894
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,620

Nevermind.

896
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:46,000
I forgot what I was gonna say.

897
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,060
We'll never know.

898
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:52,760
You remember what, Toki!

899
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,060
Remember what?

900
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:57,740
Yeah.

901
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:00,060
We'll never know.

902
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:08,550
I'm gonna grab all these coins

903
01:03:17,770 --> 01:03:24,170
Oh my god, it's the classic Also, by the way, we might not
play the Empress games Because apparently everyone was

904
01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:30,990
telling me that I might get Might get YouTube, like the
YouTube guys might not like it So we're swapping games for

905
01:03:30,990 --> 01:03:36,230
the Empress game on Saturday Don't do it, Toki, no.

906
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:42,590
Like the Walter White gift in the car in the window is like,
Toki, no, no, don't do it.

907
01:03:43,450 --> 01:03:45,690
You might get striped by YouTube.

908
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:46,970
Toki, no.

909
01:03:49,610 --> 01:03:51,070
So we're going to change it.

910
01:03:53,150 --> 01:03:55,690
Yay, I know this place from Kingdom Hearts.

911

We made it.

913
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:07,630
What took you so long?

914
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:10,050
I was grabbing all the loose chains.

915
01:04:10,450 --> 01:04:12,590
I know just where to find Captain Hook.

916
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:17,200
We're off to Neverland.

917
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:19,560
Second star to the right and straight on to the mark.

918
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,400
Star Fox, if it was good.

919
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,660

01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:24,120
Thank you.

921
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:24,900
Thank you.

922
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,980
Remember to me, I am not a Disney show.

923
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:31,780
Mr. Walt did not pay me to say that.

924
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:34,100
All right, nice.

925
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:35,420
All right, I leave now.

926
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:39,900
Oh, it's called your...

927
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:42,100
Was it your royal empress or something?

928
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:56,180
I'll get out That's crazy that there's still like a loading
time It's fine Oh wait I wanted to take a picture of Where

929
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:57,320
the fuck am I supposed to?

930
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:03,820
Okay I need to look at my map I need to look at my park map
Wait adventure journal What's this?

931
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:14,520
Oh Help Mickey complete a photo album Find Donald's Okay I
need oh it's the Matterhorn Oh that's the Yeti thing Okay

932
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,820
that's it Show on map.

933
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:17,540
Where is it?

934
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:18,640
Where's the Matterhorn?

935
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:20,300
Wait, where am I?

936
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,000
Okay, that's Pixie Hollow.

937
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:23,960
Wait, no!

938
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:24,860
Wait, where am I going?

939
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:26,460
Okay, no, I don't need to go to Pixie.

940
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:27,720
Oh my god, there's so many games.

941
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:32,140
Wait, wait, this is literally, like, giving this to a child
is cheaper than Disneyland.

942
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:33,560
Wait, this is so much better.

943
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:35,820
Yeah.

944
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:38,800
So, fun fact.

945
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:44,980
Apparently they fucked up the Matterhorn when they added the
Yeti.

946
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:54,780
Like whenever the Yeti move, the Matterhorn was slowly,
slowly and slowly breaking down.

947
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,780
Like the actual structure was like weakening every time the
Yeti was being used.

948
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:02,500
That is actually crazy.

949
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:09,360
So like if that's why like they had to stop the animatronic
because every time he moves, he's literally destroying the

950
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:11,280
fucking ride.

951
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:14,180
He fixed it now apparently.

952
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:18,920
Yeah, they fucked up the build on it.

953
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:23,220
So, like, it was actually, like, destroying the support
structure.

954
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:28,440
Is it that's the one in...

955
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,760
Aren't they all Matterhorns?

956
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:30,760
Or is it a different...

957
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:34,460
Or is it, like, a different name for it?

958
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:37,560
Because I know, like, I know they all...

959
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:38,760
He had the Yeti.

960
01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:47,830
Where's Galaxy?

961
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:50,710
I don't think Galaxy Edge is...

962
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:51,750
It's in...

963
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:53,510
It was there in 2000.

964
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:54,890
What was this game?

965
01:06:55,070 --> 01:06:56,130
When did this game come out?

966
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:57,790
The Connect is old as fuck.

967
01:06:57,910 --> 01:06:58,450
I don't even know.

968
01:06:59,550 --> 01:07:00,870
I don't need to go to the Matterhorn.

969
01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:02,450
Where the fuck is it?

970
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:03,670
Oh my god.

971
01:07:03,870 --> 01:07:05,050
Look at all that fucking...

972
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:05,790
Oh my god.

973
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:06,190
Wait.

974
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:07,110
Aurora's here.

975
01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:07,950
And Cinderella.

976
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:09,130
Cinderella.

977
01:07:09,630 --> 01:07:10,350
Oh my gosh.

978
01:07:10,350 --> 01:07:10,750
Cinderella.

979
01:07:11,150 --> 01:07:12,070
Was Cinderella 3?

980
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:14,310
With the song.

981
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:17,910
Yeah.

982
01:07:18,090 --> 01:07:19,110
It's a similar ride.

983
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:20,390
Oh there's the Matterhorn.

984
01:07:21,390 --> 01:07:22,210
There it is.

985
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:25,030
Do they accept?

986
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:27,550
Oh, there's Pixie Hollow.

987
01:07:28,850 --> 01:07:30,770
Okay, no, I have to go find Donald's hat.

988
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:34,650
Cinderella 3 was so good.

989
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:37,030
I love the song that the little mice sang.

990
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:39,870
I forgot how it goes, but it was one of my favorite songs.

991
01:07:40,410 --> 01:07:41,130
It's so dumb.

992
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:45,290
Let's see.

993
01:07:45,310 --> 01:07:46,030
Oh, hey!

994
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:47,130
There's the beast!

995
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:48,670
Kill the beast!

996
01:07:49,390 --> 01:07:50,090
Kill the beast!

997
01:07:50,270 --> 01:07:50,810

1007
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:21,920
We'll just, like, turn it off.

1008
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:25,380
You might have destroyed the support structure of the...

1009

01:09:12,110 --> 01:09:13,770
I can't believe the beast is fresh.

1016
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:15,430
They're all French.

1017
01:09:17,490 --> 01:09:19,590
I need to use the bathroom here back.

1018
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,320
It's rumored to pee before you go on a ride.

1019
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:30,120
That is so true.

1020
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:32,720
Because you're going to be in that line for like three
hours.

1021
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,140
Sigil, Nexi, thank you for the super chat.

1022
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:37,420
Thank you.

1023
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:38,120
Thank you.

1024
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:39,020
Thank you.

1025
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:43,140
Ryu, Mike, AK, Papa, Smurf, Mennie, Alan, thank you.

1026
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:43,640
Super chat.

1027
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:43,840
Thank you.

1028
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:44,520
Thank you.

1029
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:45,940
All right.

1030
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,420
Let's go do that Bob sled.

1031
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:50,200
Let's get Donald's lean left or right.

1032
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,080
What happens when I bump into it?

1033
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,160
I mean, it's a kid's game.

1034
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:55,060
It should be fine, right?

1035
01:10:58,830 --> 01:10:59,230
Yay!

1036
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:02,630
This does not look very safe for children, Mickey!

1037
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:03,330
Yay!

1038
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:04,930
Mr. Mouse.

1039
01:11:06,230 --> 01:11:06,990
What the fuck is it?

1040
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:11,250
So Richo, Wilhams, Wilhams, scream.

1041
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:14,070
Sorry about that.

1042
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:16,310
Say, are you ready to hit the slope?

1043
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:16,930
Yeah!

1044
01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:18,610
Yeah, Kofi!

1045
01:11:20,570 --> 01:11:22,210
Hold on tight now.

1046
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:24,870
This wind will blow your ears back.

1047
01:11:25,810 --> 01:11:26,190
Yeah!

1048
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:31,010
We'll have...

1049
01:11:31,010 --> 01:11:31,730
What happens?

1050
01:11:32,210 --> 01:11:32,810
Oh my god!

1051
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:33,170
Oh my god!

1052
01:11:33,350 --> 01:11:33,910
I'm okay.

1053
01:11:35,570 --> 01:11:37,850
I got wait, will it be Sonic where okay.

1054
01:11:37,990 --> 01:11:38,730
I lose points.

1055
01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:39,090
Okay.

1056
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:44,490
Yeah Why I don't think this ride has safety inspections.

1057
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:49,170
Yes, I don't think this ride is made for children All right.

1058
01:11:51,230 --> 01:11:54,570
Yeah, it's okay, but that's okay.

1059
01:11:54,710 --> 01:12:05,110
My parents signed a form before I got on this ride And so
And I think it was a I think it was a good forum, right?

1060
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:07,250
Did you see nothing to it?

1061
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:14,360
Don't worry, they agreed to the terms of service on Disney
Plus, so I was allowed to ride on this ride.

1062
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:16,480
Oh no, they're easier to get me.

1063
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:18,060
Oh no, not the Yeti.

1064
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:20,040
Not the abominable snow, man.

1065
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:23,520
I'm sure Donald's had us up here on this mountain somewhere.

1066
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:26,820
What the fuck are trying to kill me?

1067
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:30,020
Oh my god!

1068
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:43,360
Guys, maybe we should have built a ride in their home guys
maybe maybe we shouldn't have built a ride there oh no the

1069
01:12:43,360 --> 01:13:00,520
ride's gonna collapse wait where yeah I could jump this
entire time yeah oh fuck you oh my god it's alright kids

1070

1071
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,860
Oh, bye Goofy.

1072
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,000
Don't worry, it's Disney Magic.

1073
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:17,320
It's like, what happened to the other kids that took this
ride, I wonder.

1074
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:21,500
All right, nice.

1075
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:23,720
All the coins I need for...

1076
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:28,900
All the coins I need for my photo album, too.

1077
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:31,660
It's all staged.

1078
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,680
It's all scripted.

1079
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:36,020
Goddamn mouse.

1080
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:40,260
It's like those singers that like lip sync to during
concerts.

1081
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,340
Like, I know what you are.

1082
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:45,640
Oh my god, goodbye, goofy.

1083
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:47,660
Oh, wait, what?

1084
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:48,660
Oh, that scared me.

1085
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:52,000
I thought I was like, I did not run into the fucking gap.

1086
01:13:57,310 --> 01:13:57,670
Eh.

1087
01:13:58,930 --> 01:14:00,170
I did it.

1088
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:04,790
I guess when you're playing on the connect, you're like
actually leaning left and right.

1089
01:14:05,210 --> 01:14:06,490
Where you're like, wow.

1090
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:07,970
Wow.

1091
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:08,890
Don't worry.

1092
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:09,750
I'm being immersive.

1093
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:11,790
When I go right, I leave right.

1094
01:14:12,450 --> 01:14:12,450
Whoa

1095
01:14:15,670 --> 01:14:24,130
Yeah I'm drifting Sure is quiet here.

1096
01:14:24,650 --> 01:14:26,310

1097
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,230
No Oh

1098
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,820

Oh, can I take a picture of this?

1105
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:22,620
Oh, I can say hi to it.

1106
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:26,120
Take a picture of this plant.

1107
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,380
It's a beautiful plant.

1108
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:33,120
Oh, yeah.

1109
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:36,400
And apparently, Disney parks are supposed to smell like
cotton candy.

1110
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:40,540
They literally have these little scent things scattered
around the Disney park.

1111
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:44,740
And then, where the fuck is Donald?

1112
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:50,620
To make sure, like, things smell like cotton, like cotton
candy and flowers.

1113
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:56,780
It's a small world.

1114
01:15:57,820 --> 01:15:59,460
We have to go to smallهاbutton.

1115
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:03,080
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1116
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:06,560
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1117
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:09,600
It's a small world after all.

1118
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:19,100
It's a small world after all It's a small world I'm always
afraid of it's a small world Because I feel like there's so

1119
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:22,020
many animatronics there And I feel like if they come to life
I would actually die

1120
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:28,980
Do we have to go?

1121
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:34,980
It's literally I feel like it's a small world It's literally
the ride where there's no wait time Like no one wants to go

1122
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:40,500
to it's like Parents who go Parents who take their kids to
it's a small world When they want to fucking sit down

1123
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:47,340
Because there's never a line for this fucking ride I don't
think you're coming.

1124
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:47,780
Oh, yeah!

1125
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:49,040
What is this?

1126
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,000
It's alive!

1127
01:16:53,560 --> 01:17:07,540
This is not as a small world.

1128
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,000
What the fuck is this?

1129
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:14,220
What the fuck?

1130
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:15,780
This is just hard labor.

1131
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:19,880
Oh, hey, it's...

1132
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:21,220
Oh, it's the Wild West!

1133
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:30,980
And here we are in the desi plains and rocky valleys of the
American Old West.

1134
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:33,320
Let's see what dance step they have to teach you.

1135
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,700
Whoa, why don't you teach me, little kid?

1136
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:39,520
Oh!

1137
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:45,570
It's a small world.

1138
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:49,630
After all, it's a small world.

1139
01:17:49,910 --> 01:17:54,470
After all, it's a small, small world.

1140
01:17:54,790 --> 01:17:57,090
Oh my God, it's literally a rhythm game.

1141
01:17:57,090 --> 01:18:09,150
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no Nah, nah,

no, no, no, no, no

1147
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:47,980
It's a small world, after all, money!

1148
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,360
The traditional gritty.

1149
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:58,260
Put your hands up!

1150
01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:00,140
Put your hands up for small world!

1151
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:14,170
Raise the roof!

1152
01:19:14,610 --> 01:19:15,910
Raise the roof, girl!

1153
01:19:18,570 --> 01:19:21,450
Yeah, it's a small world always freaks me out, even as an
adult.

1154
01:19:22,230 --> 01:19:24,850
Because, like, I always feel like I could get murdered
there.

1155
01:19:27,270 --> 01:19:30,090
Like, the animatronics and it's a small world, they just...

1156
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:31,270
There's just something ain't right.

1157
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:32,950
Like, it just...

1158
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:35,610
It just feels like there's something weird going on, you
know?

1159
01:19:36,030 --> 01:19:37,130
I don't know how to explain it.

1160
01:19:39,970 --> 01:19:41,150
What the fuck?

1161
01:19:41,890 --> 01:19:42,650
Oh, where am I?

1162
01:19:42,730 --> 01:19:43,950
This is the entirety of Europe?

1163
01:19:44,350 --> 01:19:44,970
In India?

1164
01:19:45,430 --> 01:19:46,310
Wait, no, Russia.

1165
01:19:46,510 --> 01:19:47,670
That's the Russia place.

1166
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:50,390
I thought that was the Taj Mahal at first.

1167
01:19:51,010 --> 01:19:53,350
The dancers will teach you some new dance moves.

1168
01:19:53,910 --> 01:19:54,850
Just follow along.

1169
01:19:56,170 --> 01:19:57,550
Oh, we're in Europe now.

1170
01:20:01,290 --> 01:20:02,810
Yeah, we're in Europe land.

1171
01:20:05,590 --> 01:20:06,230
I don't know.

1172
01:20:06,270 --> 01:20:07,890
There's just something about the animatronic.

1173
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:21,430
that just feel there's just something feels off ah yes the

Thank you.

1261
01:27:56,710 --> 01:27:57,450

1271
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:32,750
So it's like a thousand, a thousand Mickey Mouse coins Is
like one cent.

1272
01:28:34,170 --> 01:28:34,970
One American dollar.

1273
01:28:35,190 --> 01:28:36,130
One American cent.

01:33:43,850 --> 01:33:45,190
He's like sigh-eyeing me.

1358
01:33:45,930 --> 01:33:46,750

Yeah, there's something weird about Minnie's model.

1369
01:34:06,950 --> 01:34:07,870
I think, I don't know.

1370
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:10,570
Maybe it's the head.

1371
01:34:10,870 --> 01:34:11,690
There's something off.

1372
01:34:11,790 --> 01:34:13,370

1373
01:34:14,610 --> 01:34:15,550

I thought that was fucking crazy.

1490
01:41:15,350 --> 01:41:25,190
Apparently there was, like, a very important, like, ride, a
moment in the Bayou Adventure and then they like didn't have

01:41:25,190 --> 01:41:25,570
it on.

1492
01:41:25,670 --> 01:41:30,130
It was like a literal TV screen too and they couldn't get to
work for half a year.

1493
01:41:33,450 --> 01:41:40,950
Yeah, it was it replaced Splash Mountain but even then like
it's already, the fact that it's already breaking down after

1494
01:41:42,270 --> 01:41:44,290
after like a year is crazy.

01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:55,780
Don't forget to obtain your Space Ranger uniform, Cadet.

1522
01:44:56,620 --> 01:44:57,940
Until next time.

1523
01:44:58,180 --> 01:45:00,240
The Zerg plans to invade the system.

1524
01:45:00,540 --> 01:45:01,200
Okay, so...

1525
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:06,020
So, hypothetically, if Disney made a...

1526
01:45:06,760 --> 01:45:08,220
How do I...

1527
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:09,480
Yeah?

1528
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:12,300
Take the shot.

1529
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:13,400
Take the shot.

1530
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:16,340
Take the shot.

1531
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:18,600
Doki, take the shot.

1532
01:45:22,620 --> 01:45:25,060
Where the fuck am I supposed to shoot anyway?

1533
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,880
Where do I shoot this?

1534
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:29,700
I am Buzz Lightyear.

1535
01:45:30,340 --> 01:45:31,640
I call him in peace.

1536
01:45:31,980 --> 01:45:34,380
You get a one from Cinderella.

1537
01:45:35,340 --> 01:45:35,880
How do I?

1538
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:38,540
How do I shoot my gun?

1539
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:42,460
The shot that could end the war.

1540
01:45:46,360 --> 01:45:47,480
Do it, Doki.

1541
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:57,480
Take the shot save the world the shot that will save the
world I can't even take a shot anywhere I don't it's like

1542
01:45:57,480 --> 01:46:07,440
you could only use it in certain places where can I use it
the shot heard around the world I assume it's in here but oh

1543
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:19,270
we're not allowed in here the blast area yet no he said he
said oh here do I shoot it he said I could take the shot in

1544
01:46:19,270 --> 01:46:20,310
like certain areas.

1545
01:46:20,550 --> 01:46:21,710
I won't say a thing.

1546
01:46:21,990 --> 01:46:23,890
But like, what area would that be?

1547
01:46:27,030 --> 01:46:28,510
There was a hidden Mickey?

1548
01:46:30,890 --> 01:46:32,850
Oh, there's a Platte Auto Blaster, though.

1549
01:46:33,690 --> 01:46:34,330
And beyond!

1550
01:46:35,070 --> 01:46:35,750
Okay, so

1551
01:46:40,590 --> 01:46:41,150
um...

1552
01:46:41,150 --> 01:46:50,150
So basically, hypothetically, if Disney remade Buzz
Lightyear into a 3D film, um, basically they said that

1553
01:46:50,150 --> 01:46:59,230
emperor zerg is literally buzz light year from the future
because every time he travels into space like he's sent on a

1554
01:46:59,230 --> 01:47:07,150
mission and every time he travels in space like uh 20 plus
years pass or some shit so by time he comes back like his

1555
01:47:07,150 --> 01:47:13,630
best friend is dead and then he keeps traveling in the
future more and more and more to the point where like

1556
01:47:17,810 --> 01:47:27,490
to join the army yeah they enlisted me let's go and then
they found the plot twist was that Emperor Zerg was actually

1557
01:47:27,490 --> 01:47:34,930
Buzz Lightyear from the heroic rescue it's dangerous but we
have an advantage and that's why people are like what the

1558
01:47:35,810 --> 01:47:45,750
fuck we'll go in fast duck under Zerg's radar and rescue the
enemy okay I'm not gonna read your comment I was like yeah

1559
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:58,930
that's funny you may have lost the no it's it's literally
him oh my god oh my god i'm literally i'm literally a ranger

1560
01:47:58,930 --> 01:48:13,970
they enlisted a child for war well in the in the old version
it's his it's his dad like the classic story but but in the

1561
01:48:13,970 --> 01:48:20,430
3d film in the 3d adaptation it's Oh, I have to reload.

1562
01:48:20,870 --> 01:48:20,910
Reload!

1563
01:48:22,770 --> 01:48:24,650
In the 3D film, it's him.

1564
01:48:26,190 --> 01:48:27,890
You know, Buzz, it'd be cool if you helped out.

1565
01:48:28,250 --> 01:48:28,890
That's alright.

1566
01:48:31,430 --> 01:48:32,410
There you go, I did it.

1567
01:48:34,290 --> 01:48:37,850
Yeah, the original is a Star Wars reference because it was
made...

1568
01:48:37,850 --> 01:48:38,390
It was...

1569
01:48:38,390 --> 01:48:40,750
Buzz, like, you know, it was like a parody of Star Wars, in
a way.

1570
01:48:41,990 --> 01:48:42,630
Like, the...

1571
01:48:42,630 --> 01:48:45,210
Not, like, full parody, but it was, like, you know...

1572
01:48:45,210 --> 01:48:46,090
They're saying, like...

1573
01:48:48,570 --> 01:48:54,990
Uh, you know how like in the original toy story it was like
Woody was like his favorite toy and the Star Wars came out

1574
01:48:54,990 --> 01:48:56,190
So they're like, what's next year?

1575
01:48:57,290 --> 01:48:58,830
Yeah, we have a lot of sci-fi stuff.

1576
01:48:59,090 --> 01:49:01,630
Yeah, including Star Wars Oh,

1577
01:49:07,590 --> 01:49:08,890
I'm targeting the arm.

1578
01:49:09,290 --> 01:49:20,650
Don't worry You're now an amputee All right Oh shit, I'm
okay.

1579
01:49:26,290 --> 01:49:28,830
We're doing it.

1580
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:33,520
Make a kid do it.

1581
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:36,800
Make a kid do a man's job.

1582
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,140
Let's go.

1583
01:49:42,700 --> 01:49:43,760
Well.

1584
01:49:46,970 --> 01:49:48,030

01:49:49,370 --> 01:49:49,930
Well.

1586
01:49:51,550 --> 01:49:56,150
I'm having trouble apparently controlling my my blasters mr.

1587
01:49:56,430 --> 01:49:56,930
Buzz Lightyear.

1588
01:49:57,090 --> 01:50:05,370
It's okay that that I'm literally like killing the animal

01:51:00,210 --> 01:51:02,370
Only slightly painful.

1595
01:51:02,990 --> 01:51:03,910
Come on.

1596
01:51:07,450 --> 01:51:09,250

All right, back to the pie.

With democracy.

1599
01:51:15,070 --> 01:51:15,690
Why?

1600
01:51:16,010 --> 01:51:17,250
What did I do, guys?

1601
01:51:17,770 --> 01:51:19,950
I don't know what you guys are talking about.

1602
01:51:20,270 --> 01:51:22,410
Mark, thank you for the super chat.

1603
01:51:22,810 --> 01:51:23,610
Thank you.

1604
01:51:23,730 --> 01:51:27,490
Kids would love this compliment butchering of everyone's
child.

1605
01:51:29,430 --> 01:51:31,110
Thank you for the super chat.

1606

01:51:31,730 --> 01:51:31,910
Thank you.

1608
01:51:31,950 --> 01:51:32,650
What did I do?

1609
01:51:33,090 --> 01:51:34,910
Yes, I'm innocent.

1610
01:51:35,390 --> 01:51:36,850
I was just using my blaster

1611
01:51:40,150 --> 01:51:42,210
All right, I want to change the sense.

1612
01:51:42,530 --> 01:51:47,490
I don't keep changing it, but for some reason the sense is
like sometimes it's like super fast And then suddenly it's

1613
01:51:47,490 --> 01:51:48,350
like so slow

1614
01:51:53,470 --> 01:51:55,170
Okay, I think that should be better.

1615
01:51:56,030 --> 01:51:57,890
I want to use my gun

1616
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:09,980
It should be a place for me to shoot it.

1617
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:12,280
He said it works for certain areas.

1618
01:52:13,020 --> 01:52:14,840
What area is it?

1619
01:52:20,220 --> 01:52:21,140
To aim like.

1620
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:22,120
Oh, okay.

1621
01:52:22,940 --> 01:52:23,160

Save the planet.

1623
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:28,940
I am aiming.

1624
01:52:35,980 --> 01:52:37,240
Oh my god.

1625
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:38,980
It just says aim.

1626
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:40,220
How do I shoot?

1627
01:52:40,220 --> 01:52:45,260
I just want to use my gun.

1628
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:52,040
Oh, where is she?

1629
01:52:55,220 --> 01:52:55,720
Oh, wait.

1630
01:52:56,660 --> 01:52:57,640
Wait, they have...

1631
01:52:57,640 --> 01:52:58,640
I can, like...

1632
01:52:59,460 --> 01:53:00,860
I saw the Buzz Lightyear uniform.

1633
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:01,380
I could buy.

1634
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:01,900
Yeah.

1635
01:53:02,120 --> 01:53:02,440
Oh, my God.

1636
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:03,140
I could be a fish suit.

1637
01:53:03,220 --> 01:53:03,360
Wait.

1638
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:04,620
Oh.

1639
01:53:08,220 --> 01:53:09,920
You're a Dessa, Princess Aurora.

1640
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:11,440
Oh, I could be a princess.

1641
01:53:13,780 --> 01:53:15,140
Okay, but I could be a fish, though.

1642
01:53:18,660 --> 01:53:20,300
I'll complete our fish.

1643
01:53:20,820 --> 01:53:23,080
Oh my god, it's from the Finding Mimo ride.

1644
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:24,400
Okay, what does this do?

1645
01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:27,340
I'm a fish.

1646
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:30,260
Oh, I wish I could be our fish princess.

1647
01:53:31,500 --> 01:53:32,700
I could be Cinderella.

1648
01:53:37,110 --> 01:53:38,870
Oh, I should buy the autograph books.

1649
01:53:38,990 --> 01:53:40,110
I need to keep buying them.

1650
01:53:40,190 --> 01:53:42,350
I have enough money for it.

1651
01:53:43,090 --> 01:53:44,110
Look at me go.

01:54:02,870 --> 01:54:06,010
Alright, we got all the autograph books.

1659
01:54:06,110 --> 01:54:08,270
We can now legally get their autographs.

1660
01:54:09,650 --> 01:54:11,510
Oh my god, are you kidding me?

1661
01:54:11,730 --> 01:54:16,030
You have to go to the shop of each world so you can get
their photo.

1662
01:54:16,110 --> 01:54:16,850
How is there?

1663

01:54:26,890 --> 01:54:28,070

01:55:38,770 --> 01:55:51,030
The witty shirt is scary Oh my guys which one Do I wear my
buzzlight gear hat Or my fish costume Which one is better I

1685
01:55:51,030 --> 01:55:56,370
like how the fish isn't even like, because it's based off of
the Finding Nemo, right?

1686
01:55:56,950 --> 01:55:59,250
But it's not even like any of the characters.

1687
01:55:59,410 --> 01:56:01,370
It's literally just a random ass fish.

1688
01:56:03,570 --> 01:56:05,210
The fish is insane.

1689
01:56:05,550 --> 01:56:07,850
It's like they're like, here's the Finding Nemo ride.

1690
01:56:08,250 --> 01:56:10,770
It's like based off of the Finding Nemo ride.

1691
01:56:10,930 --> 01:56:13,450
I'm like, it's just, it's not even any of the characters.

1692
01:56:13,670 --> 01:56:15,230
It's just a fucking random fish.

1693
01:56:22,390 --> 01:56:24,370
Well, dude, if Walt Disney hit it better.

Stitch starving!

1719
01:57:57,570 --> 01:58:01,170
The origin of the boo-boo- Honestly, you're not drugged.

1720
01:58:02,230 --> 01:58:07,930
Just keep your eyes peeled, and I'll give a shout if I- He
looked like madness level.

1721
01:58:08,470 --> 01:58:09,030
Very high.

1722
01:58:09,390 --> 01:58:09,690
Yay!

1723
01:58:15,940 --> 01:58:18,240
It's funny because, uh, what's it called?

1724
01:58:18,660 --> 01:58:18,760
The...

1725
01:58:18,760 --> 01:58:19,580
Look, there's one.

1726
01:58:19,900 --> 01:58:20,920
Told you we'd find them.

1727
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:21,720
Oh, there's a food.

1728
01:58:21,820 --> 01:58:22,660
There's food already here.

1729
01:58:22,740 --> 01:58:23,300
Let's go.

1730
01:58:24,780 --> 01:58:25,140
Yay!

1731
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:26,360
Is that it?

1732
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:28,440
Oh, you need five burgers?

1733
01:58:28,820 --> 01:58:29,460
There it is.

1734
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:31,540
Space Mountain!

1735
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:33,720
What was that?

1736
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:39,420
What was that story that always tells, like, Stitch plushies
and figurines and stuff?

1737
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:40,980
I can't remember.

1738
01:58:42,980 --> 01:58:47,360
Literally, they made merch that's like Labubu adjacent.

1739
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:52,340
He is literally the original Labubu.

1740
01:58:56,020 --> 01:58:58,340
Where are the burgers?

1741
01:58:58,640 --> 01:58:59,800
I'm gonna go to Space Mountain.

1742
01:59:00,020 --> 01:59:06,080
What was that store?

1743
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:08,880
I can't remember.

1744
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:18,500
sells a lot of like uh no that sells a lot of like um
plushies and merchant figures of stitch as well as like

1745
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:28,780
zutopia and like other like sanrio stuff too what was it try
to remember they sell like a lot of like like it's very

1746
01:59:28,780 --> 01:59:39,660
similar it's like it's like it's like almost like popmart
but like it's like a the cat um the enemy brand of pop If

1747
01:59:39,660 --> 01:59:46,960
you go to Maniso, you can actually find, like, the
boo-boo-like stitch toys or stitch figures.

1748
01:59:48,820 --> 01:59:49,600
I'm not joking.

1749
01:59:49,780 --> 01:59:51,240
I'll show you guys one right now.

1750
01:59:51,580 --> 01:59:57,380
But after I do mission control, they're like the enemy brand
of Pop Mart.

1751
01:59:58,860 --> 01:59:59,940
They're like their rivals.

1752
02:00:00,700 --> 02:00:02,480
It's like McDonald's and Burger King.

1753
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:07,340
Before, like, McDonald's won.

1754
02:00:08,120 --> 02:00:09,500
It's like Coke versus Pepsi.

1755
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:18,560
wait why is this tron i'm in space mountain this is like
tron the tron bike rides in shanghai disneyland

1756
02:00:24,940 --> 02:00:35,660
welcome to your tour i will be your god this is not real
space mountain because there's no scary alien trying to kill

1757
02:00:35,660 --> 02:00:41,600
me I haven't seen one of those in here.

1758
02:00:45,090 --> 02:00:45,570
Hello?

1759
02:00:46,170 --> 02:00:49,050
Like, I was like, is he done?

1760
02:00:49,570 --> 02:00:50,450
Like, what is he trying to do?

1761
02:00:50,450 --> 02:00:52,250
Do a little fucking dance for me?

1762
02:00:54,150 --> 02:00:55,570
Oh shit, car crash.

1763
02:00:57,490 --> 02:00:58,790
Oh my god.

1764
02:01:01,550 --> 02:01:05,010
I don't think it was a good idea that I'm driving against
traffic.

1765
02:01:05,330 --> 02:01:07,710
It might not be the smartest thing I've done today.

1766
02:01:10,250 --> 02:01:17,590
Use the ship's laser to charge the game by shooting its
energy paths once charged yeah the game will greatly

1767
02:01:17,590 --> 02:01:27,310
increase the speed of objects that pass through it junk
coordinates receive do you know there's a jimmy fallon ride

1768
02:01:27,310 --> 02:01:35,390
on universal studios i know you're like how do you make a
ride out of that i know i watch a video of it and it's

1769
02:01:35,390 --> 02:01:45,150
barely a ride it's crazy they actually have a fucking Jimmy
Fallon ride.

1770
02:01:46,950 --> 02:01:48,230
But why?

1771
02:01:49,150 --> 02:01:52,330
Look, Carpool Karaoke was very popular, okay?

1772
02:01:52,810 --> 02:01:55,150
It was very, very popular.

1773
02:01:59,130 --> 02:02:03,050
Black holes are the most destructive forces in the universe.

1774
02:02:03,150 --> 02:02:06,030
It's literally like a ride taking you around New York City.

1775
02:02:06,390 --> 02:02:07,770
Like, that's the ride.

1776
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:13,680
But like, they have Jimmy Fallon's face plastic.

1777
02:02:13,700 --> 02:02:16,000
around around it

1778
02:02:19,480 --> 02:02:30,960
yeah this is not i don't really feel the space mountain of
this where is the fucking crazy alien ghost that's trying to

1779
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:32,100
kill me where is that

1780
02:02:35,140 --> 02:02:47,640
oh thank god okay nice this game surprisingly has a lot of
content i feel like i barely did anything thing in this

1781
02:02:47,640 --> 02:02:48,040
game.

1782
02:02:50,060 --> 02:02:55,120
Judging by the current velocity, with the continued use
of... Like, I barely met, like, everywhere.

1783
02:02:55,280 --> 02:02:58,660
Like, I feel like I've only met, like, 10% of the characters
in this game.

1784
02:03:01,860 --> 02:03:03,140
Alright, here we go.

1785
02:03:03,480 --> 02:03:03,960
Good job.

1786
02:03:05,480 --> 02:03:08,260
A bit more traffic than I would expect in hyperspace.

1787
02:03:08,860 --> 02:03:09,760
Impact report.

1788
02:03:10,300 --> 02:03:11,140
Minimal damage.

1789
02:03:11,880 --> 02:03:18,800
I saw someone said that you think Jimmy Fallon's kind of
bland, but, like, he just approved He's the perfect late

1790
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:20,540
night host because he's bland.

1791
02:03:21,900 --> 02:03:26,440
He doesn't offend nor does he like give you anything, which
is perfect.

1792
02:03:27,060 --> 02:03:29,180
Because you're here for the guests, not like...

1793
02:03:29,180 --> 02:03:33,820
So then that's like great for like the guests he's
interviewing because you're there for them, not for him.

1794
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:39,100
Because he's a host.

1795
02:03:39,380 --> 02:03:40,580
He's not the star.

1796
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:43,440
That's why he's so famous.

1797
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:46,480
That's why he has his own universal ride.

1798
02:03:47,180 --> 02:03:59,260
open space and we hit traffic yeah Conan was perfect though
yeah and then he got fired because he was the thing is

1799
02:03:59,260 --> 02:04:07,540
Fallon has no opinions that's why he's perfect Conan had too
many opinions and then he got fired

1800
02:04:12,020 --> 02:04:18,380
that's the issue for network executives they don't like that
they're like you have your own opinions

1801
02:04:23,020 --> 02:04:24,680
We need a yes, man.

1802
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:25,960
And that's what Fallon is.

1803
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:28,680
Good job.

1804
02:04:32,270 --> 02:04:33,150
Exiting hyperspace.

1805
02:04:34,210 --> 02:04:36,650
The comment field I'm detecting is massive.

1806
02:04:37,350 --> 02:04:37,730
Be alert.

1807
02:04:42,190 --> 02:04:44,170
Yeah, I know, like, Jayla, I know wanted to come back.

1808
02:04:44,290 --> 02:04:46,250
But still, he still, like, lost the show.

1809
02:04:48,770 --> 02:04:51,910
Like, even then, the network execs didn't really, like, give
him anything.

1810
02:04:52,430 --> 02:05:05,250
that he didn't really he didn't really treat him well after
the fact that he got like he lost his job he literally like

1811
02:05:05,250 --> 02:05:08,750
he literally like went into full depression mode right after

1812
02:05:14,720 --> 02:05:25,880
judging by your current velocity with a continued use yeah
and people forgot he after he got let go like he literally

1813
02:05:26,100 --> 02:05:34,340
locked himself in his home and didn't make a public
appearance for months like i was like is he okay like and

1814
02:05:34,340 --> 02:05:40,400
then when he finally made his public appearance you knew he
went like he was going through shit like it was like he was

1815
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:43,120
like you had like a long ass beard and everything

1816
02:05:46,900 --> 02:05:53,440
like i remember reading like seeing the articles about that
Yeah, he was going through it.

1817
02:05:53,540 --> 02:05:55,120
Because it was literally his dream job.

1818
02:05:55,460 --> 02:05:57,100
And then he lost his dream job.

1819
02:06:01,360 --> 02:06:02,600
Yeah, he became a neat...

1820
02:06:02,600 --> 02:06:03,520
No, he actually did.

1821
02:06:04,980 --> 02:06:06,600
He actually became a neat.

1822
02:06:08,100 --> 02:06:08,860
For like a wow.

1823
02:06:09,080 --> 02:06:10,980
Because like, like, uh, replacing...

1824
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:11,760
Like taking that...

1825
02:06:11,760 --> 02:06:12,020
What was it?

1826
02:06:12,120 --> 02:06:12,820
The late night show?

1827
02:06:14,500 --> 02:06:16,680
Tonight's late night show was like his dream.

1828
02:06:17,220 --> 02:06:18,140
His dream job.

1829
02:06:23,220 --> 02:06:23,720
Oh my god.

1830
02:06:23,780 --> 02:06:25,960
We're literally going through a space battle right now.

1831
02:06:33,300 --> 02:06:33,900
Yeah.

1832
02:06:46,180 --> 02:06:47,900
We did it.

1833
02:06:49,880 --> 02:06:51,460
We did Space Mountain.

1834
02:06:52,100 --> 02:06:54,780
There's something else I want to talk about before I did
Space Mountain, but I forgot.

1835
02:06:56,400 --> 02:06:58,380
I forgot what I wanted to talk about.

1836
02:06:58,740 --> 02:07:00,840
I got, I was thinking about like.

His entire siblings are dead, okay?

1997
02:18:31,100 --> 02:18:32,220
We gotta treat him well.

1998
02:18:37,480 --> 02:18:42,120
He literally lived because the shark saw his egg and was
like, I shouldn't eat that one.

1999
02:18:42,620 --> 02:18:44,260
There's something wrong with it.

2000
02:18:46,960 --> 02:18:51,180
The shark was like, there is no good nutritional value
eating this one.

2001
02:18:54,940 --> 02:18:55,500
Yay!

2002
02:19:03,390 --> 02:19:05,230

02:19:06,150 --> 02:19:10,610
I don't even remember what kind of animal, like what kind of
fish ate him.

2004
02:19:11,330 --> 02:19:13,870
It was a big ass fish though, like in his family.

2005
02:19:21,710 --> 02:19:23,830

As like a crutch.

2009
02:19:30,070 --> 02:19:31,970

we don't need it to be full screen um actually it was a
barracuda oh yeah i was gonna say ever when fighting me well

2016
02:20:33,950 --> 02:20:38,890
first came up um it was a big problem because everyone was
buying clownfishes.

2017
02:20:39,250 --> 02:20:43,250
And then it led to like clownfish being endangered because
of it.

2018
02:20:46,450 --> 02:20:46,470
Okay.

2019
02:20:46,550 --> 02:20:47,610
Oh, I met everyone.

2020
02:20:48,690 --> 02:20:48,930
Oh, wait.

2021
02:20:49,010 --> 02:20:49,410
I didn't want to go.

2022
02:20:49,410 --> 02:20:49,750
Damn it.

2023
02:20:49,790 --> 02:20:50,810
I didn't want to go to the entrance.

2024
02:20:52,930 --> 02:20:53,950
Oh, there we go.

2025
02:20:56,070 --> 02:20:56,430
Yeah.

2026
02:20:57,110 --> 02:20:59,930
But like clownfish are technically exotic fish.

2027
02:21:00,170 --> 02:21:02,450
So people didn't know how to take care of them very well.

2028
02:21:03,970 --> 02:21:04,170
Oh, wait.

2029
02:21:04,170 --> 02:21:04,890
We didn't go to front.

2030
02:21:04,990 --> 02:21:06,530
Wait, there's Critter County.

2031
02:21:06,710 --> 02:21:06,790

2038
02:21:20,550 --> 02:21:21,850
Oh, are these from the palace?

2039
02:21:21,930 --> 02:21:23,390

02:21:24,890 --> 02:21:26,210

2042
02:21:26,210 --> 02:21:27,670
Palace of the Caribbean, right?

Who's in Adventureland?

2046
02:21:35,650 --> 02:21:36,450
There's Aladdin.

2047
02:21:38,470 --> 02:21:40,050

2054
02:22:02,840 --> 02:22:03,380
Poor Woody.

2055
02:22:05,440 --> 02:22:07,720
Doesn't even get Jesse at all.

2056
02:22:07,880 --> 02:22:08,640

And strange and frightening sounds echo through the halls.

2062
02:22:56,860 --> 02:22:58,380
Whenever candle lights flicker.

2063
02:22:59,140 --> 02:23:05,400
Where the air is deathly still, that is the time when ghosts
are present.

2064
02:23:06,200 --> 02:23:10,400
Practicing their terror with ghoulish delight.

2065
02:23:24,230 --> 02:23:25,330
Go, go, go, go, go!

2066
02:23:26,410 --> 02:23:26,890

2067
02:23:30,630 --> 02:23:32,070

2068
02:23:33,330 --> 02:23:34,390
The ghost!

2069
02:23:42,660 --> 02:23:43,180
The ghost!

2070
02:23:43,180 --> 02:23:43,820
Not the ghost!

2071
02:23:44,340 --> 02:23:46,520
My grim incantation.

2072
02:23:47,840 --> 02:23:51,480
How dare you enter with no invitation.

2073
02:23:52,580 --> 02:23:54,360
The haunted mansion from Eddie Murphy.

2074
02:23:54,720 --> 02:23:57,660
So you thought you could stop in- Was the movie that bad?

2075
02:23:57,820 --> 02:23:59,160
I don't remember it being that bad.

2076
02:23:59,900 --> 02:24:00,720
Here you have trespassed.

2077
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:03,540

There's no turning back now.

2083
02:24:45,360 --> 02:24:54,000
Our tour begins here in this gallery where you see paintings
of some of our guests as they appeared in their corruptible

2084
02:24:54,000 --> 02:25:01,380
I watched a video of some guy like stayed overnight at the
haunted mansion where everything was like turned off and

2085
02:25:01,380 --> 02:25:01,700
stuff.

2086
02:25:02,040 --> 02:25:03,120
It was so freaky.

2087
02:25:03,620 --> 02:25:04,500
It looked so scary.

2088
02:25:04,800 --> 02:25:15,780
because like everything was like turned off and like um even
like the waiting like the the line queue actually looks

Hole in the wall.

I'm playing hole in the wall.

2096
02:26:05,780 --> 02:26:06,560
For a thousand.

2097
02:26:07,400 --> 02:26:08,560
Any volunteers?

2098
02:26:09,780 --> 02:26:12,920
You could try to mirror the face of the clock.

2099
02:26:14,160 --> 02:26:16,960
Time flies when you're having fun.

2100
02:26:18,260 --> 02:26:18,820
Yay.

2101
02:26:21,020 --> 02:26:25,040
Oh, I did not see him.

2102
02:26:25,280 --> 02:26:27,040
I did not see that guy.

2103
02:26:27,260 --> 02:26:27,880
What the fuck?

2104
02:26:28,520 --> 02:26:29,920
The fucking statue.

2105
02:26:29,940 --> 02:26:33,380
You almost look as though you've seen a ghost.

2106
02:26:33,620 --> 02:26:35,060
Look at the good ghost.

2107
02:26:38,140 --> 02:26:38,820
Shit.

2108
02:26:39,480 --> 02:26:40,040
I'm okay.

2109
02:26:40,420 --> 02:26:40,960
I'm okay.

2110
02:26:42,820 --> 02:26:45,280
Just a little concussion wouldn't hurt anyone.

2111
02:26:45,700 --> 02:26:47,040
Look at the NFL players.

2112
02:26:47,540 --> 02:26:48,460
They're okay, right?

2113
02:26:50,940 --> 02:26:52,560
They seem okay.

2114
02:26:53,200 --> 02:26:53,760
Oh my god.

2115
02:26:54,260 --> 02:26:56,840
Do you dare to take what is not yours?

2116
02:26:57,560 --> 02:26:58,160
Hmm?

2117
02:27:00,640 --> 02:27:01,440
Yay!

2118
02:27:12,540 --> 02:27:16,460
All our ghosts have been dying to meet you.

2119
02:27:17,400 --> 02:27:19,600
This one can hardly contain himself.

2120
02:27:21,640 --> 02:27:23,400
You waved at me.

2121
02:27:26,780 --> 02:27:28,460
Alright, I'll grab this.

2122
02:27:33,140 --> 02:27:35,500
Are you having trouble getting food?

2123
02:27:36,220 --> 02:27:36,640
No, I'm okay.

2124
02:27:37,080 --> 02:27:40,640
Traversing this endless portal could take you forever.

2125
02:27:42,280 --> 02:27:44,460
Oh, wait, I thought he was like a nice portal.

2126
02:27:44,860 --> 02:27:46,180
You might find your way.

2127
02:27:47,200 --> 02:27:49,280
Yeah, I found my way eventually.

2128
02:27:51,940 --> 02:27:52,820
I did it.

2129
02:27:54,640 --> 02:27:56,700
Okay, it was a glowing blue portal.

2130
02:27:56,940 --> 02:28:02,580
I assume what portal taught me is that when it glows blue, I
should go through it.

2131
02:28:02,740 --> 02:28:06,540
How the fuck was I supposed to know that it was an evil
portal?

2132
02:28:08,480 --> 02:28:08,840
Huh?

2133
02:28:12,560 --> 02:28:14,420
How was I supposed to know that?

2134
02:28:21,490 --> 02:28:26,850
Oh my god, that's a huge last line for the haunted mansion.

2135
02:28:32,570 --> 02:28:33,650
Wait, where is this?

2136

They had to renovate the Tarzan ride because, like, they

02:30:25,640 --> 02:30:27,400
That's why, like, we don't have it no more.

Just want to say I'm glad I found someone who's into the
Leon Stitch Show.

02:30:33,500 --> 02:30:34,400
It was so cool when I was a kid.

I love all the little cousins.

2155

Oh my god, I know, I know Cinderella.

2159
02:30:44,140 --> 02:30:47,700

And also I have all the sequel movies.

2161

Okay, I want to do the pilots of Caribbean Red.

2167
02:31:06,360 --> 02:31:09,020
The first Lilo and Stitch movie was The Cousins.

2168
02:31:09,500 --> 02:31:10,640
Oh yeah, Lilo and Stitch too.

2169

2170
02:31:20,600 --> 02:31:27,520
to watch the Japanese anime but I didn't fuck with it
because there wasn't there was no Lilo I know like the other

2171
02:31:27,520 --> 02:31:36,660
character was supposed to be like Lilo but Japanese but like
I can't you can't watch Lilo and Stitch without Lilo yeah

2172
02:31:36,660 --> 02:31:41,400

Yeah, and then I hated that, I hated that, like, they were
like, oh, it's because Lilo abandoned, like, they did a

2176
02:31:55,420 --> 02:32:01,380
cop-out for the anime, but they're like, the reason why
Lilo's not here is because Lilo abandoned Stitch for

2177
02:32:01,380 --> 02:32:01,940
college.

2178
02:32:02,320 --> 02:32:04,840
I'm like, why can't she bring Stitch to college?

2179
02:32:05,280 --> 02:32:08,560

2181
02:32:16,480 --> 02:32:19,140
Yeah, like why did Lino abandon him?

2182
02:32:19,260 --> 02:32:21,240
I didn't understand that plot point.

2183
02:32:22,540 --> 02:32:27,260
I know, like this Ohana, bro, oh that's what happened in the
live action movie, too.

2184
02:32:27,680 --> 02:32:28,440
That's what happened.

2185
02:32:28,540 --> 02:32:35,800
Like, Nami in the live, live action, that was the problem in
the live action movie, because um, um, oh my god, it's

2186
02:32:35,800 --> 02:32:36,900
Fortune Red.

2187
02:32:36,960 --> 02:32:45,800
Okay, the problem was that um in the live action nami was
like i need a i will not bet i will not i need abandon you

2188
02:32:45,800 --> 02:32:56,040
for college the whole issue like the whole thing was that uh
i cannot like child protective services were trying to take

2189
02:32:56,040 --> 02:33:02,480
lilo away or some shit because like you know um they're like
oh you're not fit to take care of lilo and she's like no i

2190
02:33:02,480 --> 02:33:08,220
am and then in the end she like gave up lilo to like her
neighbor it was like i gotta go to college now

2191
02:33:11,290 --> 02:33:13,010
Like, I gotta go to college.

2192
02:33:14,870 --> 02:33:16,590
Like, go live with your neighbor.

2193
02:33:18,070 --> 02:33:19,450
And I'm like, what the fuck?

2194
02:33:19,810 --> 02:33:21,250
What does O'Hanna mean?

2195
02:33:23,790 --> 02:33:24,890
No, I don't want to...

2196
02:33:24,890 --> 02:33:26,890
I want to find the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.

2197
02:33:26,990 --> 02:33:28,450
I'm trying to find that right now.

2198
02:33:30,170 --> 02:33:32,130
Yeah, that was fucking crazy.

2199
02:33:32,730 --> 02:33:34,630
The way they handled that.

2200
02:33:37,510 --> 02:33:39,390
Oh, yeah, they got rid of Gantu, too.

2201
02:33:39,870 --> 02:33:49,330
I guess like CGI expensive like that's why like you know how
like in the original they had like Pliquly and um um oh my

2202
02:33:49,330 --> 02:33:57,790
god fuck who was the other guy Jumba Pliquly and Jumba sorry
I forgot I can't believe I almost forgot Jumba but you know

2203
02:33:57,790 --> 02:34:10,150
Pliquly was the star but they made Pliquia and Jumba put on
like human like uh human illusions or whatever Instead of

2204
02:34:10,150 --> 02:34:16,250
having them, like, put on, like, cost, like, put on, like, a
red, like, a t-shirt and pants and be like, I'm a human.

2205
02:34:16,910 --> 02:34:18,170
Because they didn't want to do CGI.

2206
02:34:18,730 --> 02:34:20,110
The CGI was too expensive.

2207
02:34:27,040 --> 02:34:29,860
Where the fuck is the Pirates of the Caribbean, right?

2208
02:34:30,760 --> 02:34:32,680
I don't want to visit the Pirates.

2209
02:34:33,400 --> 02:34:33,800
That's it.

2211
02:34:38,020 --> 02:34:39,200
Wait, where's the fast travel?

2212
02:34:41,060 --> 02:34:43,160

Yeah, that's where it came from.

2249
02:37:58,930 --> 02:38:01,350
That's where Pirates of the Caribbean and the movie came
from.

2250
02:38:02,170 --> 02:38:04,490
They just took, like, inspiration to it.

2251
02:38:05,930 --> 02:38:07,550
Mickey Mouse rules.

2252
02:38:09,310 --> 02:38:10,130

Yeah, there's a Russian cult that worships Gadget.

2349
02:43:40,640 --> 02:43:42,920
I mean, like, look at her.

2350
02:43:43,140 --> 02:43:46,160
Who wouldn't want to start a cult over her?

2351
02:43:46,460 --> 02:43:50,160
Like, yeah, who could blame them?

2352
02:43:50,300 --> 02:43:51,400
No, it is real.

2353
02:43:51,700 --> 02:43:52,200
It is real.

2354
02:43:52,300 --> 02:43:52,780
Let me look.

2355
02:43:52,920 --> 02:43:54,440
Let me pull it up.

2356
02:43:56,700 --> 02:43:58,780
Russian cult gadget.

2357
02:44:00,640 --> 02:44:07,320
There is a Russian cult religion that worships gadget hack
wrench from Chippendale Rescue Ring.

2358
02:44:07,820 --> 02:44:07,920
Yeah.

2359
02:44:09,700 --> 02:44:11,260
Yeah, I'll show you as a picture.

2360
02:44:12,060 --> 02:44:12,940
That's actually crazy.

2361
02:44:13,140 --> 02:44:15,960
This picture does not look real, but apparently it is.

2362
02:44:20,920 --> 02:44:21,260
Yeah.

2363
02:44:23,120 --> 02:44:24,060
Why the fuck?

2364
02:44:28,060 --> 02:44:31,440
I mean, who can really blame them?

2365
02:44:31,660 --> 02:44:32,680
Yeah, let me read a quote.

2366
02:44:33,860 --> 02:44:38,660
She is the divine being, the most untouched and perfect
sibling of the great God on earth.

2367
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:39,720
Why I love her?

2368
02:44:39,860 --> 02:44:40,960
It's a super question.

2369
02:44:41,140 --> 02:44:43,660
How I can't love the goddess.

2370
02:44:43,960 --> 02:44:50,900
She is strict, cute, optimistic, and her level of technical
knowledge is unachievable for a mortal being.

2371
02:44:51,240 --> 02:44:53,280
Those are just a few of the testimonies.

2372
02:44:59,580 --> 02:45:01,100
Wait, let's look at these guys.

2373
02:45:01,500 --> 02:45:03,580
Wait, look at this photo.

2374
02:45:04,100 --> 02:45:05,000
They're just...

2375
02:45:06,120 --> 02:45:06,780
Forget it.

2376
02:45:09,420 --> 02:45:15,560
I like how they're just like Wait, what the fuck?

2377
02:45:17,780 --> 02:45:26,040
They have like a fucking Step dinner with our Lord and
Savior Gadget Where should I Sign up?

2378
02:45:26,180 --> 02:45:34,360
You gotta be in Russia Yeah, it's a Russian exclusive,
unfortunately Wait, there's this And then, wait, this one,

2379
02:45:34,400 --> 02:45:42,240
this picture is pretty Funny Look at this one Look at this
one Would I not save this one?

2380
02:45:47,180 --> 02:45:47,760
Did it save?

2381
02:45:48,280 --> 02:45:49,500
Why is it not saving?

2382
02:45:50,700 --> 02:45:54,260
This is such an important picture that I must show you guys.

2383
02:45:57,040 --> 02:45:58,340
Oh my god, it's crazy.

2384
02:45:59,140 --> 02:46:02,460
Chrome refuses to save this very important picture.

2385
02:46:06,420 --> 02:46:08,640
Okay, I have to...

2386
02:46:12,120 --> 02:46:20,380
Oh my god, it keeps denying me the save for the save this
insecure download block.

2387
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,240
Oh, I think this one is funny.

2388
02:46:28,400 --> 02:46:29,320
Wait, let me save this.

2389
02:46:32,320 --> 02:46:33,160
Here you go.

2390
02:46:35,560 --> 02:46:41,920
If I get a virus for downloading some random Russian cults
website, then It was worth it.

2391
02:46:42,560 --> 02:46:43,480
It was absolute.

2392
02:46:43,620 --> 02:46:47,160
I will say it was absolutely worth it.

2393
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,240
This is how I like to get my Russian malware.

2394
02:46:57,200 --> 02:46:58,560
I think this one was good too.

2395
02:46:59,260 --> 02:47:01,000
And I should stop saving the images themselves.

2396
02:47:01,180 --> 02:47:02,220
I'm just going to crop it.

2397
02:47:02,340 --> 02:47:05,860
I mean, it's too late.

2398
02:47:05,900 --> 02:47:08,040
I already saved it onto my PC.

2399
02:47:08,920 --> 02:47:09,460
It's too late.

2400
02:47:09,460 --> 02:47:10,800
I got the Russian malware.

2401
02:47:12,560 --> 02:47:23,820
here this one this one is crazy the gadget try this looks
like a great oh wait this one this is like the last meal

2402
02:47:23,820 --> 02:47:30,640
this is like the last meal in on in the bible but with
gadget instead

2403
02:47:39,860 --> 02:47:46,980
this is that's jesus and they're having the last last supper
yet the last supper

2404
02:47:56,820 --> 02:48:06,740
I'm talking about the Russian cult that celebrates that
worships Gadget from Chippendale the Gadget's last supper

2405
02:48:11,900 --> 02:48:19,120
where can we join someone's like we got we sold them

2406
02:48:22,240 --> 02:48:23,460
Look at the guy.

2407
02:48:23,640 --> 02:48:24,360
This is silly.

2408
02:48:25,160 --> 02:48:26,920
The future of our great nation.

2409
02:48:27,260 --> 02:48:27,980
It is bleak.

2410
02:48:28,720 --> 02:48:29,720
Education is declining.

2411
02:48:30,320 --> 02:48:33,600
Young people are turning into crazy freaks.

2412
02:48:36,540 --> 02:48:40,340
It seems the citizens are not happy.

2413
02:48:40,740 --> 02:48:42,400
We gave away the motherland.

2414
02:48:42,720 --> 02:48:45,080
We sold ourselves to the west.

2415
02:48:46,860 --> 02:48:49,280
Oh my god, the fucking comments are wild.

2416
02:48:54,900 --> 02:48:58,360
and then someone below the rescue rangers was pretty cool

2417
02:49:06,060 --> 02:49:15,660
oh apparently gadget is like extremely popular in russia
like to russian men is actually it's not even like a joke

2418
02:49:15,660 --> 02:49:22,120
people some this like this russian commenter was like random
russia here i legitimately thought that gadget was very

2419
02:49:22,120 --> 02:49:30,120
popular it was a cultural icon around the world because she
is very popular uh towards russian men among russian men

2420
02:49:41,400 --> 02:49:45,600
but why russian specifically because they have taste

2421
02:49:51,360 --> 02:50:03,880
i like how the one of them was like i can't believe them
they sold themselves to the west Gadget is Russia's ocean.

2422
02:50:05,360 --> 02:50:07,020
Oh, it's the picture still on the screen.

2423
02:50:07,440 --> 02:50:10,140
This is a very important, let me, this is very important.

2424
02:50:10,340 --> 02:50:11,480
Let me put it here.

2425
02:50:17,360 --> 02:50:18,520
I'll put it in the court.

2426
02:50:18,620 --> 02:50:20,460
I want one more autograph before we call it here.

2427
02:50:20,880 --> 02:50:24,820
Oh, I barely fucking, I realized like, I barely made any
progress in this game.

2428
02:50:26,500 --> 02:50:28,060
This game has so much shit in it.

2429
02:50:28,180 --> 02:50:28,600
That's crazy.

2430
02:50:28,880 --> 02:50:31,460
not realize three hours have almost passed.

2431
02:50:31,680 --> 02:50:34,500
I've been like, I felt like I was Ashley and Disneyland.

2432
02:50:37,860 --> 02:50:37,980
Belle!

2433
02:50:39,420 --> 02:50:40,520

02:50:51,340 --> 02:50:52,660
I found Belle first.

2441
02:50:54,960 --> 02:50:55,560
Enchante.

2442
02:50:57,540 --> 02:51:07,560
Wait, yeah, the live action is played by emma watson it's

bell was all about singing but they literally like emma

2444
02:51:14,560 --> 02:51:23,160
watson does not sing which is such a crazy casting choice if
you ever if you listen to like the songs she sang for the

2445
02:51:23,160 --> 02:51:33,220
movie it was like super fucking autotune it's so bad Yeah,

02:51:33,220 --> 02:51:43,340
book I hope you'll think of me Yeah And I'll get a hug Yeah,
they auto-tuned her really really hard Which is crazy to say

2447
02:51:43,340 --> 02:51:49,680
because there's like mixing You can get mixers where like it
doesn't sound Really auto-tuned Like even if she can't hit

2448
02:51:49,680 --> 02:52:00,980
the exact notes But like I don't know Like I guess Disney
cheaped out Like the movie so who cares because like like

2449
02:52:00,980 --> 02:52:07,480
there's mixing there's like like disney can like fucking
hire the most expensive mixers to make it so that doesn't

2450
02:52:07,480 --> 02:52:12,820
sound like it's auto-tuned but yet like i don't know they

Why it's a little girl?

I am her majesty, the queen.

2455
02:52:33,040 --> 02:52:36,320
And they're just like, why pay for an expensive mixer?

2456
02:52:36,740 --> 02:52:38,340
You'll still buy the tickets anyway.

2457
02:52:38,500 --> 02:52:39,280
It's Emma Watson.

2458
02:52:45,610 --> 02:52:45,950
Alright.

2459
02:52:46,230 --> 02:52:47,590
She will be my last autograph.

2460
02:52:47,810 --> 02:52:49,710
We'll never get the gift from Cinderella.

2461
02:52:50,850 --> 02:52:51,030
Oh.

2462
02:52:54,370 --> 02:52:56,450
AKZ, thank you for the five gifted ships.

2463
02:52:56,550 --> 02:52:57,610
They get the ender right.

2464
02:52:57,770 --> 02:52:58,650
Yeah, they were.

2465
02:52:58,750 --> 02:53:00,570
I'm pretty sure they made a lot of money still.

2466
02:53:01,970 --> 02:53:05,250
People are like, why do they still make live action?

2467
02:53:05,430 --> 02:53:07,210
Because they still make money.

2468
02:53:08,690 --> 02:53:10,830
Oh my god, it's upside down.

2469
02:53:11,190 --> 02:53:12,710
It's because there's Wonderland.

2470
02:53:13,070 --> 02:53:14,990
And it's much better than it was.

2471
02:53:15,070 --> 02:53:16,510
They make money.

2472
02:53:16,770 --> 02:53:18,830
Even though we think they don't, they do.

2473
02:53:19,930 --> 02:53:24,090
I'm always surprised how much money they make from live
action films.

2474
02:53:27,570 --> 02:53:29,430
We think they don't, but they do.

2475
02:53:30,550 --> 02:53:32,110
There's a world that exists out there.

2476
02:53:32,130 --> 02:53:43,710
side of Twitter that was so that was still believe of that
are still like suckling on Disney's live action teet.

2477
02:53:47,770 --> 02:53:49,310
I know it's always the teacups.

2478
02:53:52,610 --> 02:53:54,510
Teacups are always fun.

2479
02:53:56,390 --> 02:53:57,490
Wait, I want to go to the bat.

2480
02:53:57,590 --> 02:53:59,630
Okay, wait, I gotta get the mad hatters autograph.

2481
02:54:11,980 --> 02:54:13,600

2482
02:54:13,700 --> 02:54:14,660
I'm a real boy.

2483
02:54:15,100 --> 02:54:16,400
I like waving.

2484
02:54:16,660 --> 02:54:17,920
Oh, your nose is growing.

2485
02:54:18,340 --> 02:54:20,280
You not like waving?

2486
02:54:22,060 --> 02:54:22,600
Freak.

2487
02:54:23,160 --> 02:54:23,940

2490
02:54:29,560 --> 02:54:30,920

2495
02:54:40,760 --> 02:54:41,720

02:54:41,820 --> 02:54:43,040

2497
02:54:43,800 --> 02:54:44,740

Happy birthday to you, to me!

2502
02:55:06,070 --> 02:55:08,290
Alright, can you sign my thingy?

2503
02:55:09,570 --> 02:55:09,910
Yay!

2504
02:55:12,110 --> 02:55:20,550
Back then, on DeviantArt, everybody would, like, be she-fied
Mad Hatter and make him, like, a handsome boy.

2505
02:55:21,330 --> 02:55:22,270
A handsome man.

2506
02:55:24,590 --> 02:55:29,290
And then you all remembers the good old days on the
internet.

2507
02:55:32,670 --> 02:55:36,390
He made him a hot man in fan art.

2508
02:55:40,380 --> 02:55:42,340
He was the original one.

2509
02:55:42,460 --> 02:55:43,460
He was the original one.

2510
02:55:44,260 --> 02:55:45,140
He was!

2511
02:55:45,300 --> 02:55:55,040
I wish I was joking because like, um, for the, especially at
Disneyland, um, especially for Disneyland, uh, they would

2512
02:55:55,040 --> 02:55:57,960
have like, like, a really tall man.

2513
02:55:58,800 --> 02:56:01,600
Cost, not cost, but, um, as the cast member.

2514
02:56:02,100 --> 02:56:03,340

But before then, it was like young guys.

2524

2525

Where's my...

2526
02:56:53,480 --> 02:56:55,560

02:56:57,520 --> 02:57:01,060
And people would freak out at Disneyland when they see Mad
Hatter.

2528
02:57:05,120 --> 02:57:07,140
And then there was...

2529
02:57:07,140 --> 02:57:07,500
Wait.

2530
02:57:08,120 --> 02:57:11,420
He got like so much fan art too on Tumblr and DeviantArt.

2531
02:57:11,960 --> 02:57:12,720
Mad Hatter.

2532
02:57:27,140 --> 02:57:34,540

2535
02:57:42,360 --> 02:57:44,080
Disney Princesses fan art.

2536
02:57:46,240 --> 02:57:47,440
Oh my god, where was it?

2537
02:57:48,740 --> 02:57:50,200
Okay, I'm sorry, Mad Hatter.

2538
02:57:50,440 --> 02:57:51,000
Let me move.

2539
02:57:51,480 --> 02:57:52,580
Let me move here.

2540
02:57:55,740 --> 02:57:58,040
Because it's from this artist, and she would draw it.

2541
02:57:58,160 --> 02:57:58,580
This one.

2542
02:57:59,240 --> 02:58:01,220
Some people might remember this fan art.

2543
02:58:01,360 --> 02:58:03,580
Because she was like...

2544
02:58:03,580 --> 02:58:05,120
She was like the ringleader.

2545
02:58:06,400 --> 02:58:07,700
And the Mad Hatter.

2546
02:58:07,720 --> 02:58:08,920
fan of this artwork.

2547
02:58:09,120 --> 02:58:09,940
Does anyone remember this?

2548
02:58:10,580 --> 02:58:12,940
This was a classic artwork on DeviantArt.

2549
02:58:13,160 --> 02:58:15,900
Like everyone like it was so famous.

2550
02:58:16,020 --> 02:58:17,180
Like the Simpson one too.

2551
02:58:17,200 --> 02:58:19,360
Like the Simpsons anime artwork.

2552
02:58:21,160 --> 02:58:26,820
So this artist was like the ring leader for like the Mad
Hatter obsession.

2553
02:58:29,900 --> 02:58:35,280
And she would like she would like literally draw Mad Hatter
like almost every fucking day.

2554
02:58:40,160 --> 02:58:49,820
and wait let me i don't remember her her uh the artist like
who the artist was but like she was so famous because she

2555
02:58:49,820 --> 02:58:59,700
would always just draw mad hatter and mad hatter you said i
could find her art and all right

2556
02:59:05,660 --> 02:59:14,880
and she was very mad she was really mad about the Johnny
Depp version of Mad Hatter because she was like duh my oh

2557
02:59:14,880 --> 02:59:24,320
shit why did they make them like ugly now and she was so mad
and I remember she like posted like rants about it on her

2558
02:59:24,320 --> 02:59:30,700
even our journal about how fucking obsessed she was upset
she was that they made the Mad Hatter ugly

2559
02:59:37,740 --> 02:59:42,740
But he was like, he was basically the OG Wensler Before the
Wensler came out

2560
02:59:47,240 --> 02:59:54,220
But yeah, God You know what, fine, we will find Cinderella
But um Where does Cinderella?

2561
02:59:54,420 --> 02:59:56,400
Cinderella should be close to her castle, right?

2562
02:59:56,740 --> 03:00:02,920
I know I kept saying last one But you know what, I'll get
last one for real Because everyone keeps yelling at me to

2563
03:00:02,920 --> 03:00:06,820

Cinderella's castle right but that's no way and then there's

03:00:43,990 --> 03:00:44,690

Is it not?

2572
03:00:54,510 --> 03:00:56,650
Or is it Sleeping Beauty's castle?

2573
03:00:59,110 --> 03:01:00,550
Oh no.

2574
03:01:00,670 --> 03:01:02,210
I have a surprise for you.

2575
03:01:02,910 --> 03:01:05,430
It's a magic wand from my fairy god.

2576
03:01:05,670 --> 03:01:06,390

03:01:47,110 --> 03:01:47,130
Yay.

2582
03:01:49,470 --> 03:01:51,650
I thought I was beautiful.

2583
03:01:53,510 --> 03:01:54,710
My parents allowed me.

2584
03:01:56,510 --> 03:01:56,830
Yay!

2585
03:02:00,390 --> 03:02:02,170
You'd like me to sign this?

2586
03:02:02,870 --> 03:02:03,850
Oh, yes, please.

2587
03:02:04,230 --> 03:02:05,930
I had to go after my book, please.

2588
03:02:06,230 --> 03:02:07,770
And then I was going to sell it on YouTube.

2589
03:02:07,790 --> 03:02:12,250
bay make sure it's a blue pen so i can transfer it

2590
03:02:15,270 --> 03:02:22,850
that's crazy i'm never signing autographs with a blue pen
anymore after i found that out it's blue yeah blue markers

2591
03:02:22,850 --> 03:02:33,310
apparently like apparently if people uh if you get given a
blue marker um it's mostly because like they want to like

2592
03:02:33,310 --> 03:02:38,850
make replicas of your autograph yeah I think it's the color.

2593
03:02:38,910 --> 03:02:40,470
It's either color blue or red.

2594
03:02:42,010 --> 03:02:43,170
So, like, people are like...

2595
03:02:43,170 --> 03:02:44,770
So, like, celebrities are like...

2596
03:02:44,770 --> 03:02:49,450
That's why celebrities refuse to sign autographs with, like,
colored markers.

2597
03:02:51,410 --> 03:02:52,430
Because you can literally...

2598
03:02:52,430 --> 03:02:55,230
You can, like, forge signatures with blue markers.

2599
03:02:56,190 --> 03:02:58,270
It's because you can transfer it or some shit.

2600
03:02:59,550 --> 03:03:00,250
Oh, shit.

2601
03:03:00,550 --> 03:03:00,830
I get...

2602
03:03:01,590 --> 03:03:04,610
I would never autograph something with a blue marker.

2603
03:03:06,010 --> 03:03:07,770
Yeah, it's easier to come.

2604
03:03:07,790 --> 03:03:09,130
Happy.

2605
03:03:18,150 --> 03:03:21,910
What does the magic wand do?

2606
03:03:23,630 --> 03:03:26,250
Can I do that?

2607
03:03:26,370 --> 03:03:28,670
Something sparkly that catches your eye.

2608
03:03:29,110 --> 03:03:29,850

2609
03:03:32,920 --> 03:03:35,760
