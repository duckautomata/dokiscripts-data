1
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,420
No, you don't have to deafen.

2
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,420
You can all join in.

3
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:10,740
What are you doing now?

4
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,580
I know you're doing it now.

5
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,340
Yeah, hey, we're live.

6
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,460
We're live.

7
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,740
We're live.

8
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,640
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

9
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,800
What do you mean, wait?

10
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,840
What do you mean, wait?

11
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,400
I don't know what you just said.

12
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,180
Alright, guys.

13
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,700
Welcome to the Toki Verde X Oversight Custom.

14
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,200
We're doing it live.

15
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,260
One million dollars.

16
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,980
No, it's not going to be a million dollars.

17
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:36,540
It's ten million.

18
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,260
Yes, funded by Nice Wig.

19
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,720
What the fuck?

20
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,920
You get the hundred thieves money.

21
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,840
What do you mean?

22
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,200
I don't know.

23
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,440
You were CEO for the day, Wig.

24
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,140
Yeah, one day.

25
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,420
Yeah, the one day you just made my bank account.

26
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,420
One day you made like nine million.

27
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,000
Yeah.

28
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,960
On that day, like one team, one tournament winnings and you took all of it.

29
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,020
I wish.

30
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,120
That's some real shit.

31
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,360
I would have done that by far.

32
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,540
Out of your mind.

33
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,240
Hell yeah.

34
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,760
Wig, are you excited?

35
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,500
Are you excited to get you and Greek to cast this?

36
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,280
Yeah, I'm pumped, dude.

37
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,240
Okay, Wig didn't fully read the rules.

38
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,640
You love making up lies.

39
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,120
There's nothing stronger.

40
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,720
There's nothing stronger than a Doki Verde lie.

41
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,100
I just missed every single rule.

42
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,460
Yeah, you missed every single rule.

43
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,480
We were like, Oh, do you know who the princess is?

44
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,280
And then he said, Oh, is it Doki?

45
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,740
But lies, if he read the rules, he would know that every pro player was supposed to be the princess.

46
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:40,840
Wait, wait, wait.

47
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,100
It says here, princess.

48
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,760
It doesn't say on game five.

49
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,840
It just says princess can use any ability.

50
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,460
Oh, you're reading a TLDR because you can't read.

51
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,760
That's what Temple made the TLDR exactly because they don't read the full rules.

52
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,120
Oh, I didn't read.

53
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,900
Yeah, I didn't read the full rules.

54
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,940
Okay, I didn't even know there was another one.

55
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,160
If you have a professional player on your team, they will be the princess.

56
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,540
For other teams, you decide who the princess will be.

57
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,380
Oh, so Doki should just be the princess.

58
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,040
Are you trying to say Jen's not a pro?

59
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,340
I'm saying you're literally the goat.

60
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,380
That's what I'm trying to say.

61
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,800
You're Hermothy.

62
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,780
Okay, I have a confession.

63
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,880
Even though I organized this custom, I haven't played Apex in like three weeks.

64
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,320
Yeah, you're killing it.

65
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,740
Did you send me that link for that VTuber thing?

66
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,960
Yeah, I did it in a multi-dex thing.

67
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,980
Oh, yeah.

68
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,780
Are these a lot of VTubers?

69
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,140
I've been playing Apex for three weeks.

70
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,780
Oh yeah, when was the last time you played Altair?

71
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,980
Oh, the rules don't apply to me.

72
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,840
This is really hard.

73
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,040
Wait, are all the people in the tab people playing this person?

74
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,200
No, no, it's like randomized.

75
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,380
You have to select your own VTuber.

76
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,800
You have to put it on yourself.

77
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,220
Okay, I don't know how to do that now.

78
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,460
You said you could do it!

79
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,180
I'm watching someone play Mario Kart.

80
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,300
You literally said you could do it!

81
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,180
I told you it wasn't me.

82
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,220
It was hard, it was difficult.

83
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,660
Jokey, you're going to be on YouTube or both?

84
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,520
I'm on YouTube.

85
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,720
Okay, I'm on yours.

86
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,140
That's good.

87
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,500
Okay, you see yourself.

88
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,980
You see yourself bouncing around.

89
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,180
Wait, I do?

90
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,360
Oh, that's me!

91
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,500
Yeah, that's me, dude.

92
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,100
Let's go.

93
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:26,620
That was dope.

94
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,760
Let me pull up to the stream.

95
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,240
There's so many VTubers in this thing.

96
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:39,460
I'm not complaining, I'm just saying it's hard to find out who's going to be live on YouTube.

97
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,660
Oh, Kewpie's playing!

98
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,300
Alright, Kewpie's going in the mix, obviously.

99
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:42,960
What the fuck?

100
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,340
Kewpie's a goat.

101
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,480
She wants to win so she can talk to you.

102
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,060
Are you excited?

103
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,460
She's the goat, dude.

104
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,280
I love Kewpie.

105
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,240
She's literally hilarious.

106
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,900
She's been working on her English, apparently.

107
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,920
She's getting way better.

108
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,780
She's going to try so hard just to be able to talk to you if she wins.

109
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,480
That's my dog, dude.

110
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,720
I hope she wins.

111
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,400
She also is cracked, so there's a really good chance she does take a W.

112
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,300
Alright, I'll make sure to message.

113
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,580
What about Tappy?

114
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,860
Tappy's really good.

115
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,780
One Tappy's gross.

116
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,560
Oh wait, there's actually some... I didn't realize.

117
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,460
I didn't realize!

118
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,880
No, I'm saying the VTubers can actually play-play.

119
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,300
Yeah.

120
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,760
He didn't even look at the list of the other people.

121
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,940
That's crazy.

122
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:26,660
Wow.

123
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,680
Is Nocturnal not considered a VTuber?

124
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,280
Dude, he looked at the NA people chat.

125
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,820
If he has his fucking cam on, no.

126
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,780
He just wanted to use his little handsome face in that clip.

127
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,060
Yeah, he's a fleshy.

128
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,480
Fleshy?

129
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,600
Yeah, that's you.

130
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,460
You're fleshy.

131
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,720
Wait, so how do I type people's names in, though?

132
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,260
I see the plus thing, but I can't type names.

133
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,580
Okay, so you go to URL and you paste the URL.

134
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,840
Oh my god, this is going to be so long to do.

135
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,440
So the opening ceremony is us teaching Wig how to use multidex right now.

136
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,400
Welcome to the tournament, guys.

137
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,920
I appreciate y'all for being here, man.

138
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:02,880
We're locked in.

139
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,080
Greek's supposed to be here.

140
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,420
I think he forgot, to be honest.

141
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,020
All good, though.

142
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,800
But he joined the server!

143
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:13,360
He joined the server, like, two hours ago, so I assume he knows.

144
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,400
Yeah, you're right.

145
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,900
I don't know where he's at, to be honest.

146
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,540
Wait, aren't you guys roommates anymore?

147
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,560
Oh, you guys still?

148
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,240
Yeah, you can literally just go up to him.

149
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,720
Yeah, I probably should, huh?

150
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,180
How about Discord pick, like, move in?

151
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:28,920
Yeah.

152
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,260
You guys are bouncing, so people will know he's talking.

153
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,560
I'm bouncing.

154
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,620
I'm jiggling.

155
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,320
Holy.

156
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,460
Did you make this website, Toki?

157
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,180
Don't say that.

158
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,000
Toki, you made that website?

159
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,280
It's not great.

160
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,060
It's good, it's just, like, it's not made for idiots, that's, like, the problem.

161
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,820
This is made for smart people, and I just don't really have them in me.

162
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,280
So you're trying to say, like, VTuber fans are smarter than the average fleshy?

163
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,580
Can we be honest?

164
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:53,940
Probably.

165
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:54,820
Whoa!

166
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,200
Not people like that.

167
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,700
A lot of people watch you, so.

168
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,020
Whoa, it's okay.

169
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,920
You're figuring it out now.

170
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,020
You can use this for later.

171
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,080
You can use this for next VTuber tournaments, now that you've figured it out.

172
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:14,800
Yeah, actually, it kind of helped me out here, but none of it's working, so this is great and all, but I'm really high-pressing.

173
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,620
Enter, and nothing's happening.

174
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,760
I remember I just said, NA Apex fans are very slow.

175
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,280
Wow.

176
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:25,900
No, it's sort of, um, I'll say, like, not NA fans, I'll say, like, NA players are very slow, and I'm an NA player.

177
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:26,800
I...

178
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,900
I sort of agree as an NA player.

179
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,300
I'm malding right now.

180
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,960
You're malding because of the...

181
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,000
Can you do something?

182
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,200
Can you try this?

183
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:38,800
You're smarter.

184
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,340
Not now, Greek!

185
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,100
One second!

186
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:44,640
What?

187
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,880
Oh shit, wait.

188
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,080
I'm getting messages that Designful is still not here.

189
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,520
Where the fuck is Designful?

190
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,500
Where is Design?

191
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,000
And saw the colorful buttons, and then I got confused.

192
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,220
You want me to tell Timmy to call him?

193
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,500
Yeah, get Designful.

194
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,660
Designful's not here.

195
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,080
They're like, where is he?

196
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,400
Timmy and Designful are both supposed to be playing?

197
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:05,860
Yeah.

198
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,680
Timmy's on, right?

199
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,680
Well, I don't know.

200
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,060
I don't see him in the voice channel.

201
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,900
Yeah, you can call him.

202
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,360
Okay, I'm gonna wake him up.

203
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,800
How is this link not valid?

204
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,040
How is the link...

205
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,160
Alright, but welcome to...

206
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,900
Welcome to the custom, everybody!

207
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:25,780
Welcome!

208
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,500
Customs, people are not showing up, cuz.

209
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,300
Don't understand what's happening right now.

210
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,580
Okay, let's see.

211
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,020
Alright, let me explain the rules real quick.

212
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,740
Let me swap.

213
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,140
Alright, guys, so...

214
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,560
Let's be a little bit formal here.

215
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,800
Let's actually have an opening ceremony, cuz we have like 15 minutes left till the game starts.

216
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,080
Nice, we're just letting you know.

217
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,960
Alright, let me go live then.

218
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,480
We have 15 minutes till the games are supposed to start.

219
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,820
Okay, so, yeah.

220
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,960
You start this off.

221
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:55,940
Alright, so...

222
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,360
I got the slides up, so you guys don't see it.

223
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,760
But, like, the slides are up now.

224
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,740
So, I'll do like a brief recap of all the slides.

225
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,860
So, what are you doing?

226
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,320
This is a VTuber slash pro tournament.

227
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,900
Not tournament, it's a custom.

228
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,040
So, every game somebody can be a winner.

229
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,180
And we have three prizes going out.

230
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,420
So, we have the $5000 first place prize with medals.

231
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:23,280
I actually have, like, a preview of the medals.

232
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,880
It's a work in progress right now.

233
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,780
But, like, it's either gonna be in gold or in color.

234
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,360
So, we're still deciding.

235
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:30,560
Gold?

236
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:31,440
Okay!

237
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,840
So, this is what the medals are gonna look like.

238
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:43,740
Maybe it's either gonna be in gold or, like, in full color, which I forgot to save the image, but you'll sort of be able to figure out.

239
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,460
Oh, wait, no, I do have the image.

240
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,020
It's right here.

241
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,900
This is what the medals might potentially look like.

242
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,680
And there's a huge shout out to GamerSups for funding, for making this for us.

243
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,040
And also, we're gonna have...

244
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,940
Everybody's gonna be sent a pin to be like, thank you for participating.

245
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,580
So, everybody's gonna receive this.

246
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,740
And... And you think game is right?

247
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,060
Yeah, or this one here.

248
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,120
We have 10 minutes before...

249
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,440
To be fair, we have... It starts at 6.15.

250
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,200
I'm going, you're locked in.

251
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,880
I'm so locked in.

252
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,180
I'm so... Anyway, we have...

253
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:26,280
Wait, why don't you help explain, too, since you clearly read the rules.

254
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,700
What part were you at right there?

255
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,700
I'm at the rules part.

256
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,440
What are these schemes gonna be like?

257
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,320
Okay, guys.

258
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,700
So, we got six games today.

259
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,820
So, we need to lock the fuck in and go over all the rules here.

260
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,880
Or I will start banning people in Dunkey's chat.

261
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,940
I do have that in mind.

262
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,280
You're not even married in my...

263
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,260
Okay, so I'm gonna get... I'm gonna get that and then we'll... Then I'm gonna start banning people.

264
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,780
Let's lock in six games here today.

265
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,860
One game... Game one, not one game.

266
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,840
Game one will be the normal game I'm rolling.

267
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,120
I'm gonna read the TLDR here because we gotta go fast, of course.

268
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,280
I read the whole rules, but we gotta make sure we lock in.

269
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:56,760
We have like 20 minutes.

270
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,640
Master and Fred can only carry one gun at a time for a game.

271
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,060
It's gonna be a normal game here on World's Edge, but only one gun.

272
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,840
Wait, how many Master Preds do you guys...

273
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,880
Doki, are you considered a Master?

274
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,220
No, shut up.

275
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,980
No, I am.

276
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,760
I'm considered a Master.

277
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,660
Regis, are you Master Pred?

278
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,680
No, he's not.

279
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,220
He's Diamond.

280
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:13,760
He's not.

281
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,560
He can use any gun.

282
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,660
Isn't Regis nice at games?

283
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,120
Boo.

284
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,800
You don't know that.

285
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,180
You don't know.

286
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,240
This is the first time you've met him.

287
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,700
You don't know that.

288
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,260
Game number two.

289
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,040
Whoa, whoa.

290
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,540
Game two is gonna be melee only on Storm Point.

291
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,740
No damaging abilities or grenades there.

292
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,140
So that's gonna be very interesting.

293
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,940
Someone's gonna get beat off in that game for sure.

294
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,420
Guaranteed.

295
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,860
Game three is gonna be charged.

296
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,420
Send to Lombo and Kraber only on E-District.

297
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,000
That's gonna be an absolute shitshow.

298
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:36,920
Can't wait to watch that one.

299
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,820
Master and Fred can only carry one of those guns at a time and cannot melee.

300
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,040
So...

301
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,640
Yeah, but Altair can melee.

302
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,700
So we can...

303
00:12:47,700 --> 00:13:00,020
So I was talking about how it would be funny for teams without a master or pro player they're just gonna be in a corner waiting for a guy to roll up and they're just gonna fucking stop brawling at him in the fucking corner.

304
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,560
That's gonna be like 30 teams alive.

305
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,840
Round six, no one's gonna be dead.

306
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,060
Also, you can use all abilities but no grenades.

307
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:12,540
Interesting.

308
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,260
And then no vantage rampart and cannot fight until ring one is closed.

309
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,840
So if you fight before ring one is closed, I will personally remove you from the lobby.

310
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,060
Yeah, he's gonna do that.

311
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,000
He has that power.

312
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,340
Yes.

313
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,140
I don't have that.

314
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:23,800
I don't think I should.

315
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,000
I don't have the power but I...

316
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,400
You call them out on stream, right?

317
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,880
Yeah, sure.

318
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,180
Why not?

319
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:31,600
I'll do it.

320
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,000
Use it like the server chat and be like get the fuck out.

321
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,940
So game four is gonna be a hide and seek on Broken Moon and no one can damage each other.

322
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,160
Now, I didn't read the real rules for that one.

323
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:42,980
How does that work?

324
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,480
So, it's gonna be...

325
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,740
Our team is the seekers.

326
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:55,720
I was thinking Altera and I we're gonna compete against Jen to see who can kill the most hiders and we'll figure out the prize later.

327
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,620
So like...

328
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,040
Just punch them.

329
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,640
You get the punch, we get the shield.

330
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,220
So we're gonna be the seekers.

331
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,840
So we're gonna be eliminating the hiders together.

332
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,580
Beautiful.

333
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,300
Everyone will land in one corner of the map.

334
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,740
We love eliminating the opposition.

335
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,400
PoppaJenBirds in the chat.

336
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,840
PoppaJen, I fucking love you, man.

337
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:16,420
Love you.

338
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,520
Your dad taught me how to curse, by the way.

339
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,360
Wait, what?

340
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:19,800
Like what?

341
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,280
And I told him how to curse.

342
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,640
No, he just gets mad at me for cursing and then he cursed at me for cursing too much.

343
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:30,560
And then game five is gonna be protect the princess on E-District.

344
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,120
You only carry one gun at a time.

345
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,840
Princess can use ability slash melee only, no grenades or guns.

346
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,400
No vantage rampart, damn.

347
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,480
And when princess gets finished, the team must surrender.

348
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,480
That sounds crazy.

349
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:51,640
When the princess is finished, which a lot of people in this tournament will not have an idea what that means, they gotta surrender.

350
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,500
Everyone has to give up.

351
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,820
The whole team just gotta drop their guns, stop shooting, and just die.

352
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,000
If they get downed and rez, is that okay?

353
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,280
Well, yeah, if they get downed and you can rez them, it's like full knock, so they're full kill.

354
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,920
Then you're GG's, you're out.

355
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,340
I think we have a comp for that.

356
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:07,920
I have an idea.

357
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:08,880
Slay the princess.

358
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,820
Slay the princess!

359
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:15,480
But, Gem, do we tell our strat on stream live?

360
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,940
No, no, no.

361
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:23,220
All we're saying is that Tempo came into our chat and told us the game changing strat.

362
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,920
Not rigged, by the way.

363
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,320
It's not rigged.

364
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,540
What do you mean?

365
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,660
It's a strat.

366
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,200
I'll look away.

367
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,100
Yeah, yeah, look away, look away.

368
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,100
Of course, now and ever.

369
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,360
Game 6 is gonna be the normal OG on King's Canyon.

370
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,520
Master Pred can only carry one gun at a time.

371
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:49,440
So you guys putting Master Pred players at a handicap, which is fair, because we do have a friendly mix of Integrity going on here.

372
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,640
We got some Hoes, we got some Gem Burtons, we got some Dokis.

373
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,380
We got some Opias.

374
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

375
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,500
We got people that's never played Apex before, so, you know.

376
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,160
Yeah, we actually do.

377
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,580
Yesterday, they were like, this is my first time playing Apex.

378
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,040
That's so crazy.

379
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,440
That is insane.

380
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,800
They're gonna have either a great time.

381
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,880
Actually, no, but you guys did a really good job evening it out.

382
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,300
Yeah, we have some games that are not part of shooting, you know, so like hide and seek.

383
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,660
Yeah, so like hide and seek and melee.

384
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,540
Imagine Newcastle.

385
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,320
Yeah, you can't use Newcastle.

386
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,260
Yeah, so it's damaging.

387
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:35,900
But you can use the Q, because I thought it would be really funny if everybody throws their Q at one person and they all bloody die.

388
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,200
Do you guys know the Q does damage?

389
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,260
I literally found that out like two weeks ago.

390
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,420
That the Q does damage.

391
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,360
You didn't know that?

392
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,240
No, I didn't.

393
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,500
Like who the fuck gets hit by a mobile shield?

394
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:49,880
Real shit.

395
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,560
I didn't know that either.

396
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,700
I was just trying to play along.

397
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:59,240
That's why I was like, you can use the Q, because I think it's fucking hilarious if you die to a mobile shield.

398
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,140
It does 20 damage.

399
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,800
I feel like if you die to a mobile shield, you probably should just uninstall.

400
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,160
Greek, any thoughts here, Greek, on what we're watching today?

401
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,420
I think it's going to be pure chaos.

402
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,380
Are you excited?

403
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,140
Oh, absolutely.

404
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,600
Yeah, which game are you most excited for, buddy?

405
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,800
I think protect the princess.

406
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,760
You see how the pros be like pack meals for everybody?

407
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,100
It's going to be chaos to watch.

408
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:32,120
I think it's because the team who loses their princess has to just insta do nothing and just stand there.

409
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,280
That's exactly what it is.

410
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,860
Just let them fucking run at the team.

411
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,700
Just give up and just stand still.

412
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,200
Just eat it.

413
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,180
Just take it.

414
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,040
Just execution style.

415
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,980
It's like, it's over.

416
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,820
You failed your mission.

417
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,220
That's so funny.

418
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,920
I mean, no, I think you guys did a good job too, like kind of just wrapping the games to be fair for everybody.

419
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,320
I'm actually really excited.

420
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,000
I think it's a good idea.

421
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,600
It's really cool that you're working with Tempo because Tempo is the goat.

422
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,340
The goat of Apex.

423
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,760
Somebody gotta hire him.

424
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,700
Guys, not only is he single, but he doesn't have a job right now.

425
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,020
So you guys should hire him.

426
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,800
You guys should definitely not take the fact he's single into his resume.

427
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,500
If you're down to work with HR very frequently, then you might be down for that.

428
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,540
That's crazy work.

429
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,140
It's insane work.

430
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,120
Oh, yes.

431
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:36,700
Also, you forgot to mention in the rules, in game one, if there's a team that are way too overpowered and killed the majority of the teams, as a lobby, we get to decide how to nerf them for match six.

432
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,340
So it would be like a public execution under...

433
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:42,820
There you go.

434
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,140
Well, I mean, that's what I'm saying.

435
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,300
I feel like you did a really good job evening this out, and lobbies should be fair.

436
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,340
Yeah.

437
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,640
So that makes them not want to get nerfed.

438
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,200
What kind of handicap would you want to give teams that might be too strong?

439
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,000
Because of me?

440
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:58,520
Yeah.

441
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,440
My god, put them to your feet or some crazy shit?

442
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:02,760
Why?

443
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,860
Yeah, I mean, you can make whatever you want, right?

444
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,720
Maybe opposite influence.

445
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,800
Go get a controller if you're an MNK player.

446
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,820
Go get an MNK if you're a control player.

447
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,240
That'd be good.

448
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,440
Oh my god, that'd be funny.

449
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,820
They should all have a controller or an MNK.

450
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,080
They can use MNK.

451
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,940
You should have one.

452
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,840
What about we do a poll and let chat pick what characters they have to play?

453
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,200
Yeah, but then that's not really a nerf for some people.

454
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,880
They can, like, adapt to it.

455
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,840
I'd like to pick what gun they can use.

456
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:33,520
Oh.

457
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,100
So just singling one gun?

458
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,780
Yeah, like one P20.

459
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:43,820
It's OG P20 and it's on King's Canyon where the loop pool is other shit.

460
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,840
So it's like, you don't know if they'll be able to find that specific gun.

461
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,980
What about look inversion?

462
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,480
Like where they look left and it goes right?

463
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,300
Oh, hey!

464
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,540
That would be fun.

465
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,020
Those guys would get shit on.

466
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,600
Oh my god, that would be so fun.

467
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,740
One of the control players, South Pole, legacy.

468
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,700
That's what I'm saying.

469
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,200
Oh, man.

470
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,840
I'm trying to choose who to watch.

471
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,680
I gotta watch RPR for this, for one of the tabs, for sure.

472
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,140
And why don't you just put up YouTube?

473
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,800
Did you give up on the multi-view?

474
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,980
No, so I have to wait for people to be live in order for that to work.

475
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,940
This is like a horrible start for me.

476
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,340
Is Timmy's design awake?

477
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,400
I don't know.

478
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,640
These are the teams, guys.

479
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:26,820
That's us.

480
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,560
And our princess.

481
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,660
Oh my god, yeah, our princess is right here.

482
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,760
Oh, Amma's here too.

483
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,680
Oh shit, we got bangers in here today.

484
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,460
I'm locked in.

485
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,320
Alright, let's see.

486
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,420
Is everybody here?

487
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,240
Is everybody...

488
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,980
Wait, is Designful or Timmy on yet?

489
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,080
No.

490
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,000
Okay, that's a little...

491
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,840
I called Timmy and he didn't answer.

492
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,740
I called Timmy and he didn't answer.

493
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,000
You're the one that's like...

494
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,040
Wait, are you still in Australia?

495
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,460
Yeah, I'm still in Aussie.

496
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,300
Yeah, you're in Australia and you're here.

497
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:00,920
I'm still in Aussie.

498
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,620
It's bloody 1pm right now.

499
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,640
Bloody.

500
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,620
Oh no.

501
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,000
What do you call a stovetop?

502
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,820
What do you call a stovetop?

503
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,920
Yeah, what do you call a stovetop?

504
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,140
Okay.

505
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,040
People in the UK call it the hob.

506
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:17,960
A what?

507
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,340
I've never heard that in my life.

508
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,520
That's a made up word.

509
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,680
H-O-B.

510
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,260
Oh, I've heard that before.

511
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,980
That's why they're on an island.

512
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,900
Well, Australia's on an island too, but like...

513
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,820
Get that terminology out of here.

514
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,680
Weren't you guys deported criminals?

515
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,720
Woah, woah, woah.

516
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,840
What do you mean woah, woah, woah?

517
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,700
They're losers of the emu wars.

518
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:46,800
That's history.

519
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,560
Oh, that's true.

520
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,820
They did lose to the emu wars.

521
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,600
That's a little embarrassing for deported criminals.

522
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,280
Imagine the emus.

523
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,580
I felt like the criminal thing was just like...

524
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,220
Loitering or like...

525
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:58,840
Look, listen.

526
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,060
Back then, we had muskets, alright?

527
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,320
We didn't have AK-47s.

528
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:03,700
And they had feathers.

529
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,460
They don't even have bullets.

530
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,660
Like, what do you mean?

531
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,480
They're emus.

532
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,800
When you ever watch a fucking emu, bro, they're terrifying.

533
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,940
The fuckers are literally so scary.

534
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,360
They'll just peg you until you die.

535
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,080
Peg you?

536
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:18,780
Wow.

537
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:21,620
Woah.

538
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,320
I just got crazy.

539
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,800
Woah, that's crazy.

540
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:25,960
That's crazy.

541
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,480
I would not fuck with emus, bro.

542
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,180
Those things are scary.

543
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,540
Aussies go wild.

544
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,360
Aussies do go wild.

545
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,080
Dude, I have to wait for these people to go live.

546
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,180
I'm balding.

547
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,940
Just add everyone and be like, go live now.

548
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,420
I'm about to start going crazy in this chat.

549
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,280
Players, I don't even understand what I'm saying.

550
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,300
No, Dash is here.

551
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,060
Our JP translator is here.

552
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,560
Dash!

553
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,880
What's up, buddy?

554
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,760
I just woke up.

555
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,800
Here's some of the prizes, too, guys.

556
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,780
I'm showing it on stream.

557
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,540
Here's some of the prizes that Tempo took photos of.

558
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,200
We also have a Funko Pop, too.

559
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,360
Nice.

560
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,800
Yo, Carl, wake up!

561
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,720
What's he saying?

562
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:11,940
What?

563
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,820
Is he waking up?

564
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,220
I don't think so.

565
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,380
Why is it...

566
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,780
Why is it silent?

567
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,520
Okay, quick question.

568
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,060
Yeah?

569
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,480
Design and Timmy are both not replying.

570
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,540
Well, Jen's literally on call with him right now.

571
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,340
With Timmy.

572
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,220
Oh, he picked up?

573
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,900
Um, I don't know.

574
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,300
He's literally on call with him.

575
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,420
He's not responding, apparently.

576
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,620
Yeah, so those two aren't here.

577
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,460
And then I don't see Sykkuno in...

578
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,740
No, Sykkuno is red.

579
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,720
He said he's...

580
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:46,900
What?

581
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,500
Did he just woke up?

582
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,860
Yeah, he woke up.

583
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,220
How is he not...

584
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,420
It's 6pm.

585
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,180
Yeah, I don't know what their schedule is.

586
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:00,760
It's crazy.

587
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,740
I woke up nice and early for this tourney, bro.

588
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,040
Yeah!

589
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,740
Okay, but you're not NA.

590
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,840
It's 11 o'clock for us.

591
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,820
No, Japanese is late.

592
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,760
Oh, that's true.

593
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,620
But the matches are supposed to start at 6.15pm.

594
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,500
So they have time.

595
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,380
Yeah, we have time.

596
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:23,640
It's the gamer way.

597
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,880
Wake up, don't brush your teeth, no deodorant, just hop on stream and you're good to go.

598
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,780
Yeah, I mean, you're going to be inside anyway, so it's fine.

599
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:30,680
Totally.

600
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,920
It's totally not, yeah.

601
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,220
Did you brush your teeth?

602
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,580
Whoa, two times a day?

603
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:37,640
Okay.

604
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,820
And a tongue scraper.

605
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,680
A tongue scraper?

606
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,060
Yeah, I can't wait to do the tongue scraper.

607
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:46,400
Timmy is awake, and now we just need design and then we're good?

608
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,960
Yeah, we just need design.

609
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,880
What's this prize thing you're showing?

610
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,420
Oh, there's physical prizes.

611
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,820
So like, second place.

612
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Second place, you get physical prizes donated by Tempo.

613
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,260
Apparently, so a lot of the stuff you can't buy anymore.

614
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:01,920
Yeah.

615
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,680
So it's like, limited edition.

616
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,260
I just bought a bunch of stuff.

617
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,420
And I figured I'd get it.

618
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:08,800
Oh, look at this shirt.

619
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,900
That's so cute, though.

620
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,880
Yeah, they're so cute.

621
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,660
Look at the little bloodhound.

622
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,920
That was when we were in Japan for Asia Festival.

623
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,180
Oh, you got this at the museum?

624
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,940
Yeah, I bought like 30 plushies.

625
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,000
Whoa, that thing's badass.

626
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,100
I love that thing.

627
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,680
I'm gonna give them out.

628
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,000
I have the golden one.

629
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,180
That one is a piggy bank.

630
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,280
Yeah, it's so cute.

631
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,800
I don't have this one.

632
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,320
It's a green ass.

633
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,260
Is this like, overall prizes?

634
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,040
Like, these are second place prizes.

635
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,560
So if you get second place, you get the physical prizes.

636
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,800
But you only get to win it once.

637
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,080
So like, other teams can have a chance to win it.

638
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:51,840
And then, third place, we have 45,000 apex coin packs.

639
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,480
Is that you as a doll?

640
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,320
Is that me?

641
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,120
God, I wish.

642
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,140
I wish I was cute as this.

643
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:56,940
Look at that shit.

644
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,000
That's so cute.

645
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,580
The bloodhound one?

646
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,380
That was Wraith.

647
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,120
Oh, there's like, yeah, there's a Wraith one, too, here.

648
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,760
Okay, that's pretty cool.

649
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:05,660
Yeah.

650
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,200
Oh, look, Timmy apologized.

651
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,020
Look at that.

652
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,120
Now we gotta make Designful apologize, too.

653
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:11,640
Where?

654
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,000
He just says, my bad.

655
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:17,880
I'll join the lobby.

656
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:18,420
Hold up, I'm coming.

657
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,240
Oh shit, I should join the lobby, too.

658
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,860
Wait, what's our comp for the first match?

659
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,960
Uh, I think everyone's gonna be sweating.

660
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,980
I ain't gonna lie, so...

661
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,200
What is the first match?

662
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,960
Give me Newcastle and Kat.

663
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:32,760
All right.

664
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,400
All right, what's the code?

665
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,160
Don't say the code out loud, everybody.

666
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,780
What's our team name?

667
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,380
Achievement Hunter?

668
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:44,960
IRS.

669
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,380
Yeah, we're the IRS.

670
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,000
Who's Achievement Hunter, bro?

671
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,320
I didn't think we were Achievement Hunter.

672
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,460
All right.

673
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,060
Where the fuck?

674
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,460
Oh, wait, yeah, Achievement Hunter's number.

675
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,900
Okay, I didn't look at my drop spot.

676
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,900
I know I made it.

677
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,040
I already forgot what my drop spot was.

678
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,060
Who's on team Gooner Gang?

679
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,000
Gooner Gang?

680
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,140
Um, IPN.

681
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:08,700
Respect.

682
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,180
Let me look at our landmark.

683
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,660
We are at...

684
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,060
Oh, we're at Skyhook.

685
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,860
Not the Trials side, the other side.

686
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,280
East side, motherfucker?

687
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,540
East side, yeah.

688
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,920
Skyhook East.

689
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,420
You guys excited?

690
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,540
The first match is just a normal match, though.

691
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,160
What do we do if no Timmy?

692
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,320
I mean, no Design.

693
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,140
I don't know.

694
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,380
That's a good question.

695
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,800
You gotta play, bro.

696
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,740
Jump in, bro.

697
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,400
Design might not wake up.

698
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,460
Okay, who do we know that's free right now?

699
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,400
Let's get Hal.

700
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,060
He's fucking solo ranking anyway.

701
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,180
He's getting off in like 20 minutes to go for dinner.

702
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:56,960
Oh my god.

703
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,540
I mean, that's enough for one game.

704
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,920
Is he on Gooner Gang?

705
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,020
No, he's on The Fools.

706
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,240
Gooner Gang is already...

707
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,840
Greek, this is your chance to win 3 grand.

708
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,220
Yeah, this is your chance.

709
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,740
You just gotta be there for one game.

710
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,900
Design might be awake by then.

711
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:15,980
Design wakes up by then.

712
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,900
I would be a literal detriment to a team.

713
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,840
I haven't played the game in two and a half weeks.

714
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,640
Hey, that's me too.

715
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,860
They don't want me on their team, bro.

716
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:26,860
Don't worry.

717
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,620
You'll have a great time.

718
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,020
Okay, who else?

719
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,720
Is there any pro player that's alive right now that's alone?

720
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,160
Let's see.

721
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,320
Who's alone right now?

722
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,440
Wait, wait.

723
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,960
Who is teaming with Design?

724
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,220
Who is teaming with Design?

725
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:48,360
Hold on.

726
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,720
Are they Japanese?

727
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:50,980
No, no.

728
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,080
English.

729
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,460
Okay, okay.

730
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,700
Tenjin and...

731
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,000
Tenjin and RiruSki.

732
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,920
Is there anyone alone?

733
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,760
I'm looking at it.

734
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,660
No, everybody that's online that's already in our tournament and our custom.

735
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,200
Let's see.

736
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,820
We gotta drag one person in.

737
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,280
Tao is solo queuing right now.

738
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,820
Yeah, but he's leaving in like...

739
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,720
He's leaving in 20 minutes and we don't think he's gonna...

740
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,080
I mean, unless he could...

741
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,780
Unless he wants to play for 20 minutes.

742
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,820
But you can maybe ask Stunny.

743
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:26,920
I feel like he would play.

744
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,480
Stunny always takes opportunities to play the game.

745
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,020
He's great.

746
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,400
Is he already online?

747
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,600
I think he's just playing ranked.

748
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,940
He's on stream, just watching YouTube videos.

749
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,120
Oh yeah, get him in!

750
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,200
Yeah, yeah.

751
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,160
Greek, you message him.

752
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,360
He'll respond to you faster.

753
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,400
Alright, I'll ask him.

754
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,420
That's not even possible.

755
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,140
Greek's nervous to show out in front of everybody.

756
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:48,920
He just wants to make it fair.

757
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,500
He's just walking, stunting on them.

758
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,420
Greek's nice with it.

759
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,840
Wait, someone pinged...

760
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:55,920
Oh.

761
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,800
Wait, what did they ping?

762
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,320
Uh...

763
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,820
Oh, they were asking how to join the custom lobby.

764
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,480
Oh, you post a code.

765
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,820
Yeah, Mac...

766
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,400
MacAlberLily posted a...

767
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,200
Oh, how to do it?

768
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,880
Oh, how do we get there?

769
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,460
To the private match, huh?

770
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,200
Yeah, yeah.

771
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,860
I think it's one of the people that haven't played Apex before.

772
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,780
That's why we had to do the nerfs.

773
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:21,420
Oh, wait.

774
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,400
Yo, Stunny's ranking with an amigo and QT.

775
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,800
Oh no, they got in!

776
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,880
They just got in the game!

777
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,340
StunnyCity's down.

778
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,540
No, but they just got in!

779
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,300
Tell him to throw, tell him to throw.

780
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,900
He's got 8 minutes to win a rank.

781
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,560
True, true.

782
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,540
Yeah, it's true, true.

783
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,360
That's why I'm messaging you, so you can get him all the stuff.

784
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,340
Yeah, but will he be able to, like, win in 8 minutes?

785
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:51,740
Yeah.

786
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,940
Either win in 8 minutes or lose in 8 minutes.

787
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:00,060
We won a Pred game in 2 minutes.

788
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,720
Wait, really?

789
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:02,600
How?

790
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,160
You're the only three left.

791
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,780
It went by so fast.

792
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,100
We literally just beat him, the pie's loaded in, and we just won.

793
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,780
Something was wrong with the game that day.

794
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:19,600
Someone quickly, if you're in his lobby, if you're in Stunny's lobby, just stream snipe.

795
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,280
Someone stream snipe Stunny right now.

796
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,460
Just eliminate from the lobby, so he can get into our lobby.

797
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,600
For TOS purposes, that's a joke.

798
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,540
Yeah, that's a joke, guys.

799
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:40,780
We would never include stream sniping.

800
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,200
That is illegal in the TOS.

801
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,100
It's like a little party here.

802
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:57,860
Wait, you know, someone was making that where, I can't remember if it was a game, if it was COD or something, they were gonna start banning people who were doing that?

803
00:31:59,320 --> 00:31:59,680
What?

804
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,600
Stream sniping?

805
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,820
Ban them as much as they were banning cheaters and stuff?

806
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,060
Yeah.

807
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:10,220
I can't remember what game it was, but one of the popular games was posted on Twitter that they said they were gonna start doing that as well.

808
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,900
I won't be surprised if it's Valorant.

809
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,540
Riot's really anal about stuff like that.

810
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,840
Actually, yeah, I think it was Val.

811
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:20,840
Yeah, I was gonna say, I feel like Valorant is one of the games that would be super anal about stream sniping.

812
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:27,340
I would have so much fun just watching streams and being like, oh, this person's stream sniping, and then ban them and give them a message saying, oh, it looks like you can't queue anymore.

813
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,240
LOL.

814
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:34,800
That's why Riot games people are so toxic.

815
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,940
Tempo is tired of bullshit too.

816
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:41,720
Do you guys know he has a blacklist?

817
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,320
Wait, is that public knowledge?

818
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,080
Wait, Tempo has a blacklist?

819
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:46,760
Who?

820
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,440
I love that.

821
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,700
This is the IRS explain.

822
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:51,920
That's amazing.

823
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,380
You deserve that.

824
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,200
Enlighten me, please.

825
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,680
I don't even know who the fuck's on it.

826
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,600
I support it regardless.

827
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:02,460
There's a list of teams that sign up and show up.

828
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:07,320
There's a list of players that are continuously late.

829
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,620
That includes pros and content creators.

830
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,480
There's a list of people that are flaky.

831
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,460
Wait, you have multiple lists?

832
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,460
I thought it was one list.

833
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,600
Oh, no, no.

834
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,100
Is that individual one shit?

835
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:30,640
They're individual lists so that if I don't want to deal with certain problems then I just delete all of the players all of those players from the invite list.

836
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,040
Good for you.

837
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,440
Actually good for you.

838
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,460
Good explanation right there.

839
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,480
Yeah, you deserve that though.

840
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,020
Yeah.

841
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,300
I've seen that discord, man.

842
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:41,980
You deserve that.

843
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,920
You deal with a lot, brother.

844
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:45,820
You deal with a lot.

845
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,740
That's why you'd be a good teacher.

846
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,120
I mean, he was a teacher.

847
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,820
What's easier, teaching children or handling Apex players?

848
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,440
Children.

849
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,060
Because at least I could scare them.

850
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,540
The blacklist is not scary enough?

851
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,280
Apparently not.

852
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,000
They don't give a fuck about it.

853
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,720
How would you scare these children?

854
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,320
What was the tactic for that?

855
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:14,660
Psychologically.

856
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,960
How old were these children?

857
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,360
Yeah, I was going to say, you were allowed to do that?

858
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:20,940
Junior high, high school?

859
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,220
They already have trauma.

860
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:38,080
You just make them if they start lying to you and shit and acting up then you just give them a psychological treatment where they feel like the most crappiest that they've ever felt Oh my god!

861
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:42,660
and then you keep putting them more and more into that hole and then you're like, that's right, you should have listened to me.

862
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,600
Regrestia is playing.

863
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:52,340
I can't lie to you I had a teacher I fucking hated in high school that did that to me You're definitely sticking with something that's in children's minds, bro.

864
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:58,840
No, I was a fucking terrible student after that anyway dropped out of community college and fucking did nothing.

865
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:10,600
And then my boss yelled at me because kids went home crying and then they told their parents and then my parents told my boss and I was like, well, that is unfortunate.

866
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,600
That is unfortunate.

867
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,840
That is unfortunate that your kid is stupid.

868
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,420
Oh my god!

869
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:38,720
In my defense I don't think you're gonna be hired as a teacher again It didn't matter if the kid was stupid or smart, the only thing that mattered is if they were willing to learn Yeah So even if they weren't the smartest if they really tried to learn then I would,

870
00:35:38,920 --> 00:36:01,180
I love helping those kids But then it's like the ones that come with an attitude and are actually stupid but they think they're the smartest thing in the world I just gotta, and then they have no manners and I just gotta put them in their place Yeah Yeah I was with you on the list part I got a question Yeah?

871
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,960
Where are me and Wig gonna be when these games start?

872
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,040
Is there like a separate channel for us?

873
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:23,320
Yeah, they can look above you We're not gonna hear it, I get it We have, Wig apparently we have perms though to join any of the channels and just listen to any comms we want Oh, can I influence RPR to be tilted or is that not a thing?

874
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:53,960
Yeah, you can whisper sweet whispers into his ear It's like the most intense fight and then like join a channel and like fuck it up for them That's exactly right I'll just start screaming on top of my lungs You can throw my mic and just Wig, if you wanna troll Japanese people then get me in I'll bring you I'll bring you I'll bring you You translate it for me,

875
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:10,680
that's all we need That's it, easy Hop into those channels and start making gun sounds and go pew pew pew Oh my god, Sunny Hurry up, he's dead, but he's like Wait, oh my god, he's gonna get timed out Sunny's gonna get timed out and then he can leave Wait,

876
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:11,220
what?

877
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,940
What is going on?

878
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:18,500
You can't, even if you get timed out because they can craft you, you can't leave What?

879
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:29,060

But you don't get that penalty So you know when it was only the support characters that could craft?

881
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:56,120
If you didn't have a support character on your team, you could leave Oh, yeah they have a support character But now anyone can craft You can never leave So you're stuck there In solo queue, I'm stuck in hell Oh my god Yo, 59 plus people waiting for the Sunny's rank Sunny,

887
00:38:51,940 --> 00:39:11,760
I actually don't know if he left Oh no He might definitely get the bug where he doesn't get in the game Yeah, because he has an abandoned penalty Oh, I see I think more than likely that might happen In game, then in customs it still kicks you out Alright Oh Alright,

Oh, you know what I found out, Jen?

900
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,400
I found out that You know what Tempo told me?

901
00:40:51,640 --> 00:41:10,440
When he asked you to join the custom You said no No, I never said that I'm going back in DMs And then I told Tempo Tell Jen Bird and he'll be on my team And then you instantly said yes After

902
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,560
Why is he exposing me like that?

903
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:25,300
Dude You gotta set things straight, first of all Yeah, set things straight Right at the beginning Are you with us or are you not?

904
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:40,240
Can't believe you said no at first Okay, listen, listen I have a reason why I don't Japanese tournaments, they usually take forever To start So I didn't want to play But with Doki, it's different, you know?

905
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,180
What do you mean?

906
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:58,240
We're taking forever still It feels like it didn't start instantly We're like 3 minutes late Because we're yapping all the time We're just talking I just passed by even faster That's right Also, is it the bug?

907
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,700
Is that why we're not starting?

908
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,120
Is it the stunny bug?

909
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:09,600
Why game No start Stunny dude Stunny no

910
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:28,840
Oh my god Stunny Oh no It's been stuck in starting servers Still Oh my god Is it the bug?

911
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,420
Wait, Jen, is this the bug that he was talking about?

912
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:35,380
Yeah, it's the bug, it takes forever It takes like 50 minutes Wait, what?

913
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:50,680
No I'm joking 5 minutes maybe So we blame, this is Stunny's fault I'm gonna say it Yeah, Stunny's lagging the server Maybe we should remove him and get him back in I don't know, maybe that'll fix it

914
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,100
Takes 5 minutes to load

915
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:21,920
Okay, that's fine It'll be fine, guys High priority server, by the way Because it's so high priority It takes a bit to load Yo, we need to do this customs real quick They're like, okay They're kicking everybody out Right now from the public servers So we get all the bandwidth Is that it?

916
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,720
What's the hertz of these servers?

917
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,360
Like 12?

918
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:52,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah So if you're playing rank right now You're gonna lose your RP Because we're kicking you out of your server That's right We're gonna prioritize The pro players Like always Oh, man It's gonna be fun though Wait, wait, wait Since we can use one gun,

919
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,140
you know What are you thinking?

920
00:43:54,280 --> 00:44:04,920
Because I'm thinking Like we should be using the T-Take Because that's like a little shotgun up close And at long range, it can blast someone Okay, but like Are we gonna find enough energy ammo?

921
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:16,780
Yeah, we only need like 120 for the whole game 120, that's true Oh, that's true, that's true Yeah, we can just keep shooting it Okay, but like But like, what if I miss?

922
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:36,200
You won't miss, Doki No, you won't miss You won't miss We can't have that kind of attitude on our team, Doki But I haven't used it You will never miss You're a master spread player You've never ever missed a day in your life Oh yeah, you're not gonna miss today You're not gonna miss today's custom Yes,

923
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:49,000
today it's your customs You're gonna show up Wait, Jen's chat, count the amount of shots he missed And then report it back to me at the end It said okay They left him

924
00:44:52,920 --> 00:45:02,360
They will report to you They're writing it down Now for real though, you can use whatever gun you want Alright, you're gonna use the triple take?

925
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:15,380
Alright, maybe I'll use the triple take too We'll try first match with triple take And see how it goes I don't know, Nemesis is good too, but like I don't know, in a bubble fight I mean, it's like a short shotgun, right?

926
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:32,320
Yeah, well, the Nemesis, no Oh wait, you're saying Nemesis Yeah, that's true Yeah, in a bubble fight will be a bit scary That's what we have Altair for Altair can do the bubble fight for us I'm a sword, just tell me what to do and I'll do it, okay?

927
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,360
I don't know too much about the game Alright, you're gonna have to You don't know this game, Regis?

928
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:47,260
I don't know a little bit of it, but I'm not the best He's like, he's diamond So like, I don't know what that is for you That's solid, that's solid That's like, what's that for pros?

929
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,200
Like, what do you see diamonds as?

930
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:55,380
Diamonds as Like, the best players in the world At least I see that Really?

931
00:45:55,860 --> 00:46:19,000
Because when I run into them, diamond players in ranked, they're like the best They're the best players I swear to god They have aimbot, bro We're sticking to my chat like, hey, I'm reporting my friend Yuris for bringing in the three Red team Regis, I'm sorry They all have one gun,

932
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:40,220
though Regis, if they do too well Regis, we will nerf them, we promise you that Regis, I'm coming for your ass Like the good old times in Apex South, brother We're the three red team Okay, maybe we shouldn't have a target there We're the three bronze team We're the three,

933
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,840
yeah, we're just bronze players Please don't hurt us We're three diamond players, right?

934
00:46:43,980 --> 00:47:00,240

I don't have information!

939
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:22,600
We should be screaming at Stunny, though The guy that subbed in last minute The guy that decided to join in at the last second

940
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:29,540
He's gonna leave again

941
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:37,440
Don't worry I fix it by Blaming another person

964
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:57,340
I haven't shot a triple take in a long time It definitely shows

965
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:28,840
I might have missed I might have missed On the ground right here There's a bubble in front of us Stabilize underneath Maybe I'll be better without a scope on It really shows I think you should take the scope It's a 1x Do you need a 2x?

966
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,940
Do you need a 2x?

967
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,620
I just picked the first scope What do you mean?

968
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:51,200
I blame Chen for giving me the triple take idea If I had the vault, I would have been beaming If I had the vault, it would have been okay I can't with you You like that?

969
00:53:51,260 --> 00:54:10,760
I thought you zoomed into their souls Like an egg timer or something No, I had the 1x I picked the first scope I could find It's fine, we're so safe with our white armor I think we're in zone, on guard Many teams around us The zone predictor Are you the zone guy?

970
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:15,600
To be honest, I guessed, but thank you Wait, wait!

971
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:16,980
Akaz's team is down!

Look, they all have one gun They all have one gun It's technically managed We have white armor We have one guy with two guns But we have Altair who has two guns That's practically a pred player Are they still above us?

978
00:54:52,000 --> 00:55:02,680
Wait I can hear Jen has blue armor It'll be fine Can I have multiple castle walls up?

981
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:48,960
There's a spitfire I could use a spitfire You're right A spitfire could pop off a flatline I could just run I'll give you my energy Honestly, for you probably don't care Probably the spitfire or the flatline Really?

982
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,440
Do we have enough ammo though?

983
00:55:50,440 --> 00:56:10,660
That's the thing There's a bunch in this I don't think there's enough ammo There's more here, 50 right there Oh, okay, yeah, maybe I'll do the flatline There's all three There's not enough attachments for it though I'll try the light mag here I'll do the carbine then I'll do the light mag Oh,

990
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:14,260
Somewhere northeast We have wide armor Yeah, yeah Are you sure that's a good idea?

991
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:22,980
I believe in you I believe What's the worst that could happen?

992
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:41,220
Just hang around here The worst thing is princess goes down Yeah, yeah Don't worry, he'll be fine Long live the princess He'll be so healthy He'll be so healthy Wouldn't it be funny if a team just drops on us right here?

1225
01:36:08,940 --> 01:36:11,980
You're the interviewer Wait, what?

1226
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:20,180
You're lucky I'm a professional You're the caster Oh, okay What was the mindset going in game 1?

1227
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:24,520
You got a teammate like Ditto who obviously can perform at a high level What was your thought process there?

1228
01:36:24,580 --> 01:36:31,860
Just take it as a normal game You got better players on your team Not having to deal with RPR, making bad calls What was the thought process?

1229
01:36:35,160 --> 01:37:08,260
I like those I like that I was thinking the landmark we got was landslide And since The tournament is more so based on placement When you get first Not more so the kills So we're thinking If we play Rampart, Loba, Newcastle We can easily find a spot And then Do something with it And then we just got lucky with the zone The zone was literally right beside our POI So I'm like Okay,

1230
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:19,240
we have Rampart and we have Newcastle We can easily protect that hill And yeah, we just got lucky We just protected the hill And we got the win pretty much Are you guys excited for your nerf?

1231
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:28,800
Yeah We're all aware you're getting nerfed Okay Yeah, I mean What's the nerf?

1232
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:32,500

1233
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:35,860
Oh man I mean, what could we do?

1234
01:37:35,940 --> 01:37:39,080
That's like the actual question Is there limits to this?

1235

01:37:47,860 --> 01:37:48,780
Can you do a vote in your chat?

1237
01:37:48,860 --> 01:37:50,080
Are polls existing on YouTube?

You're gonna decide on a nerf Oh my god, we should put one of them on controller Oh god What about no comps for one game?

1244
01:38:33,740 --> 01:38:35,520
No comps?

1245
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:40,260
Match 6 though, they only have one nerf And it's gonna be on match 6 You didn't read the rules!

1246
01:38:40,980 --> 01:38:44,980
I did, I did, I did Sorry, I forgot No comps?

1247
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:49,260
They have to be triple deafened for it?

1248
01:38:50,900 --> 01:39:16,480
Triple deafened I feel bad It's fair They're good at the lobby These guys are so good Yeah, but we should add one more just in case We should handicap them one more time Wait, let's let Greek decide Greek, you're the other caster, what kind of nerf would you like to see?

1249
01:39:17,420 --> 01:39:20,680
Uh, how about They have to play on 70 FOV

1250
01:39:23,980 --> 01:39:37,740
I like that one better than no audio That's good That's good, actually We should translate that Yeah, let me know what they think Yeah, game 6

1251
01:39:52,060 --> 01:39:53,420
Did it?

1252
01:39:58,380 --> 01:40:01,660
What was the nerf?

1253
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:03,800
70 FOV

1254
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:24,660
Is this selective or are you going to choose it?

1255
01:40:25,300 --> 01:40:26,460
For what?

1256
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:42,300
Wait, no, it's Greek's choice He was the one that suggested it Oh, okay, then it's going to be 70 FOV only The whole team is a 70 FOV We can talk Yeah, we can talk, right?

1257
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:49,720
Yeah, let them talk to 70 FOV He got to talk to 70 FOV

1258
01:40:56,460 --> 01:40:57,000
He got to put in

1259
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:05,880
That's fair enough Yeah, see, isn't that fun?

1260
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:20,160
Have a good time, guys Remember, it was Greek's idea I see, I see But you guys won, though!

1261
01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:21,400
Congratulations

1262
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:39,640
Congratulations Alright, congratulations Go back to your channel, we're going to talk to the other team Bye, love you guys Bye, thank you One more interview Does every winner get nerfed?

1263
01:41:40,020 --> 01:42:05,420
No, no, it was just the first match They had like 9 kills Yeah, they had 9 kills and it was like a normal match True Yeah, yeah, yeah 70 FOV gives you motion sickness a little bit If you play 70 FOV to see how big your monitor is You'll actually get a little sick You'll get a little sick after like 10 minutes I feel like you're playing virtually You're so close to the screen to see 100%,

1264
01:42:05,420 --> 01:42:09,440
you get a little dizzy and everything, brother Hey, congratulations on winning!

1265
01:42:13,580 --> 01:42:17,960
Arigatou gozaimasu Arigatou gozaimasu Arigatou gozaimasu How did you do it?

1266
01:42:18,980 --> 01:42:29,480
I actually don't know because we were all like 250 ping and teleporting So what happened was like Everybody had cars, right?

1267
01:42:29,940 --> 01:42:31,180
But you weren't a car person?

1268
01:42:31,820 --> 01:42:43,480
We didn't have a car No, we didn't have a car We were like watching everyone like Using their car and actually we were getting hit a lot So we were like How are we going to do this?

1269
01:42:43,480 --> 01:43:21,900
Actually Because I was hit by a car And I got hit out of the ring So I started using the medkit early And I think that's why I survived until the end That's the only thing It's like luck, I guess Oh my god, a non-car person won That's crazy We didn't have a car Actually we were super jealous because everybody was like driving around And we really wanted one as well So we kept standing around getting hit by the car That shit looked fun It didn't feel like a melee only mode It was like Mario Kart Bumper cars Yeah,

1270
01:43:22,900 --> 01:43:35,500
bumper cars That's true Alright well For game 3 You guys are going to use charge rifle, sendo, longbow And kraber only on e-district What's the game plan here?

1271
01:43:35,580 --> 01:43:37,560
What gun are you guys going to be running mainly?

1272
01:43:38,000 --> 01:44:03,200
Out of those options Okay Let me translate for them So our team I speak English but Nachan here, she speaks Japanese And the other person speaks Chinese So we're We're bilingual Yeah we're a bilingual team here So I need to translate a little bit So they're asking Which sniper rifle are we going to play?

1273
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:19,740
Shaobing Sentinel Jack said sentinel He's going to play sentinel Nachan All of us are playing sentinel That's a good choice We don't like the longbow?

1274
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:39,920
And we're going to miss everything No, we're going to hit every shot But if you guys are going to longbow, then you might win The longbow get buffed That's what I'm saying, longbow guys Yeah, longbow got buffed too Yeah I heard charge rifle Charge rifle can break doors now too No don't run charge rifle Why?

1275
01:44:41,460 --> 01:44:42,060
Are you scared?

1276
01:44:42,800 --> 01:45:16,400
No, no, no No, no, no I'm not scared It's just not a great gun It's just not a great gun That's all I'm saying No, of course not I'm not nervous at all That's why you need to have tempo on your team I'll look for you specifically Doki, don't worry I love it dude Thank you guys so much for coming in Congratulations again for the win Congratulations Thank you Okay,

1277
01:45:17,260 --> 01:45:26,240
bye bye Bye Well, I'll see you guys In sniper only Doki, question for you Yeah?

1278
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:29,020
Are you running a charge rifle in honor of tempo?

1279
01:45:29,440 --> 01:46:17,160
No, of course not We are not here to encourage him So only that squad is getting nerfed Yeah, only that squad is getting nerfed Because that's a normal match And the other matches are not Doesn't really matter There's no skill involved Well, sniper is skilled But you know The whole tournament nerfed They're the only team for the rest of the tournament Only match 6 Only match 6 Because the other games are more luck based So it's like They don't really have a chance to actually win I mean they do But everybody has a chance to win Alright I'll see you guys in match 3 then Good luck dude Bye Make sure to play along,

1280
01:46:17,640 --> 01:46:17,660
bro.

1281
01:46:19,380 --> 01:46:20,260
Alright, what's...

1282
01:46:20,260 --> 01:46:21,620
In punching...

1283
01:46:21,620 --> 01:46:22,960
In punching in walls...

1284
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:23,240
Calm down, calm down.

1285
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:24,540
Punching... nah, not really that.

1286
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:29,700
Guys, I found out the team that won the melee did not even have a car.

1287
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:36,180
Our car was... you know, Doki, you know our car was the only car in that zone?

1288
01:46:36,440 --> 01:46:37,420
Wait, really?

1289
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:39,920
Yes, our car was the one in the end zone.

1290
01:46:40,140 --> 01:46:40,880
Like, we were chilling.

1291
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:43,420
You were the only car that made it through?

1292
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:46,340
I had to get up because I was 1 HP, but you guys stayed in the car, right?

1293
01:46:46,860 --> 01:46:51,520
Yeah, I stayed... no, I stayed alive until somebody put a jump pad underneath the car.

1294
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,400
Yeah, the jump pad ruined me.

1295
01:46:52,540 --> 01:46:55,600
Yeah, they put a jump pad underneath the car and then I got fucked.

1296
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:56,620
I was underneath the car.

1297
01:46:56,620 --> 01:46:58,900
I was underneath the car and then it, like, booped me, dude.

1298
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:01,980
Cause I could have lived.

1299
01:47:02,020 --> 01:47:07,200
I could have lived if I didn't have the car, the jump pad.

1300
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:08,200
What's the comp?

1301
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:09,100
What's the comp we're playing?

1302
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:11,360
No Ramparts.

1303
01:47:11,620 --> 01:47:12,360
We cannot play Ramparts.

1304
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:15,940
He's playing Newcastle and you wanna play Lifeline?

1305
01:47:16,140 --> 01:47:17,360
Yeah, I can do Lifeline.

1306
01:47:17,980 --> 01:47:18,580
Yeah, do Lifeline.

1307
01:47:19,140 --> 01:47:19,400
Let's go.

1308
01:47:19,460 --> 01:47:21,840
Wait, Fun put the jump pad and killed me?

1309
01:47:21,900 --> 01:47:22,300
Oh, God.

1310
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:26,560
Dude, I knew someone was gonna play Octane.

1311
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:27,520
It's actually smart.

1312
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:28,980
I can't believe it.

1313
01:47:29,020 --> 01:47:31,240
He fucking used the one that put the jump pad.

1314
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:32,960
That fucker.

1315
01:47:33,380 --> 01:47:34,740
I'm gonna get a cough drop real quick.

1316
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:35,500
I'll be right back, guys.

1317
01:47:38,620 --> 01:47:39,840
Vantage is not allowed, chat.

1318
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:40,900
And Rampart is not.

1319
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:45,320
Oops.

1320
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:54,820
I'm back.

1321
01:47:56,540 --> 01:47:57,520
Why are we landing?

1322
01:47:57,760 --> 01:47:59,420
What is this POI?

1323
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:01,160
What are these POIs we're getting?

1324
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:01,960
What do you mean?

1325
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:02,820
It's so shit.

1326
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:04,460
It's randomised.

1327
01:48:04,680 --> 01:48:05,400
It's randomised.

1328
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:06,020
I hate this.

1329
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:07,420
He's griefing our team.

1330
01:48:07,620 --> 01:48:09,220
Our POIs are so bad.

1331
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:10,460
Except for Zeus.

1332
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:11,520
Zeus was actually good.

1333
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:12,720
Oh, my God.

1334
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:14,240
You cannot blame me.

1335
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:16,220
It was decided by AI.

1336
01:48:17,780 --> 01:48:18,680
Fuck the AI.

1337
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:19,140
For real.

1338
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:22,180
Okay.

1339
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:25,540
I just want a sniper.

1340
01:48:25,700 --> 01:48:28,520
I don't even care what sniper we get.

1341
01:48:29,540 --> 01:48:29,840
Oh, yeah.

1342
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:33,140
Tempo's gotta remind people not to shoot until first ring closes.

1343
01:48:34,060 --> 01:48:35,520
Yeah, I'm gonna get the console and shit.

1344
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:38,680
Yeah, we can't shoot because we all have to find a sniper.

1345
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:41,180
He wrote it.

1346
01:48:41,240 --> 01:48:42,000
I'm gonna write it for him.

1347
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:45,860
Where is the sniper?

1348
01:48:46,900 --> 01:48:47,960
I found a sniper.

1349
01:48:48,180 --> 01:48:48,540
Oh, my God.

1350
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:49,460
You can have two snipers.

1351
01:48:50,060 --> 01:48:51,360
Repeater counts as a sniper, no?

1352
01:48:51,740 --> 01:48:52,040
No.

1353
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:53,600
It has to use sniper ammo.

1354
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:55,920
It has to use sniper ammo.

1355
01:48:56,700 --> 01:48:57,140
I got sniper.

1356
01:48:57,860 --> 01:48:59,680
And then it can't be a wingman, too.

1357
01:49:03,260 --> 01:49:06,380
It's all snipers except for wingman and then Kraber.

1358
01:49:07,100 --> 01:49:08,140
Maybe you can get a Kraber.

1359
01:49:08,380 --> 01:49:08,980
We should get a Kraber.

1360
01:49:09,480 --> 01:49:10,280
I found a sniper.

1361
01:49:14,580 --> 01:49:15,700
We should be fine.

1362
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:17,640
Can you get this juicer next to us?

1363
01:49:18,220 --> 01:49:19,020
Yep, I got it.

1364
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:22,420
I haven't found a sniper yet.

1365
01:49:22,620 --> 01:49:23,400
I'm running around naked.

1366
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:25,140
Oh, that's fine.

1367
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:25,960
We still have one ring.

1368
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:29,000
We still have a ring.

1369
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:31,940
I'm gonna go for this juicer.

1370
01:49:32,280 --> 01:49:33,600
You guys can get this one over here.

1371
01:49:34,300 --> 01:49:34,760
Okay, yeah.

1372
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:36,940
Altair and I are heading over now.

1373
01:49:38,660 --> 01:49:39,760
Maybe we'll find a sniper.

1374
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:41,540
Yeah, maybe we'll find another sniper for you.

1375
01:49:41,540 --> 01:49:42,780
I haven't found one yet.

1376
01:49:44,420 --> 01:49:45,100
I'm not shooting.

1377
01:49:45,380 --> 01:49:46,360
I prefer longbow, though.

1378
01:49:46,420 --> 01:49:47,040
It's raining here.

1379
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:48,080
Uh-oh, you know what that means?

1380
01:49:48,300 --> 01:49:49,020
Internet's going to shit.

1381
01:49:49,100 --> 01:49:49,540
Oh, no.

1382
01:49:49,660 --> 01:49:50,160
It's okay.

1383
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:51,340
It can't be that bad.

1384
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:52,600
I'm gonna be going...

1385
01:49:53,740 --> 01:49:56,380
Wait, if you're teleporting, then they'll teleport, too.

1386
01:49:57,440 --> 01:49:58,600
Then they'll see you teleporting.

1387
01:49:58,700 --> 01:49:59,040
It's okay.

1388
01:49:59,100 --> 01:50:00,260
They can't do anything to us.

1389
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:01,860
Because the ring hasn't been closed yet.

1390
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:02,960
True.

1391
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:05,100
We can literally do a drive-by.

1392
01:50:08,220 --> 01:50:10,260
I'm gonna walk over because they can't do anything to me.

1393
01:50:10,260 --> 01:50:11,600
I'm coming over to you.

1394
01:50:11,740 --> 01:50:11,900
Yeah, what are you gonna do?

1395
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:12,600
Shoot me?

1396
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:17,760
I can tell Tambo to kick them out if they shoot me.

1397
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:23,120
Okay.

1398
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:27,460
I'm grabbing the harvester.

1399
01:50:27,980 --> 01:50:29,040
Oh, another wingman.

1400
01:50:29,300 --> 01:50:29,740
Oh, shit.

1401
01:50:29,820 --> 01:50:30,760
No, they can't punch.

1402
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:32,680
They can't punch until the ring 1 closes, guys.

1403
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:33,240
It's fine.

1404
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:33,880
They killed one.

1405
01:50:33,940 --> 01:50:34,460
They killed someone.

1406
01:50:34,620 --> 01:50:34,680
What?

1407
01:50:34,700 --> 01:50:35,300
Wait, what?

1408
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:37,200
Get him out.

1409
01:50:37,300 --> 01:50:37,620
Ban him.

1410
01:50:37,740 --> 01:50:38,100
Nice wig.

1411
01:50:38,120 --> 01:50:38,480
Ban him.

1412
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:39,440
Who was it?

1413
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:40,500
Who was it?

1414
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:41,640
Tell them to stop.

1415
01:50:41,660 --> 01:50:42,660
How could you do this to us?

1416
01:50:42,680 --> 01:50:43,600
We trusted you.

1417
01:50:43,740 --> 01:50:44,300
What do you mean?

1418
01:50:44,380 --> 01:50:45,000
I had everything.

1419
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:46,320
They didn't read the rules.

1420
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:47,180
Or the NA.

1421
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:48,180
Get them out.

1422
01:50:48,860 --> 01:50:49,200
The NA.

1423
01:50:49,620 --> 01:50:51,040
They gotta be fucking fish spine.

1424
01:50:52,100 --> 01:50:52,640
The NA.

1425
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:57,480
We got a rule breaker.

1426
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:00,040
A rule breaker.

1427
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:04,640
No, wig knows.

1428
01:51:04,640 --> 01:51:08,420
Do not fight until ring 1.

1429
01:51:08,760 --> 01:51:10,140
Wait, let them res.

1430
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:18,560
We got a rule breaker.

1431
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:19,420
They should let them res.

1432
01:51:19,700 --> 01:51:20,220
I don't have a sniper.

1433
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:20,880
I'm running around.

1434
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:22,260
Wait, you still don't have a sniper?

1435
01:51:22,680 --> 01:51:23,460
I don't have a sniper.

1436
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:24,040
What?

1437
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:26,060
I'm actually cursed.

1438
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:27,800
Oh, this is bad.

1439
01:51:28,620 --> 01:51:29,540
I found three wingmen.

1440
01:51:30,340 --> 01:51:32,080
I have 50 bullets here.

1441
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:33,220
Wait, wingmen count.

1442
01:51:33,340 --> 01:51:34,120
No, it doesn't.

1443
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:35,520
It's sniper.

1444
01:51:35,820 --> 01:51:38,600
It doesn't read the rules.

1445
01:51:39,460 --> 01:51:41,180
Give me the wingmen.

1446
01:51:41,700 --> 01:51:44,800
No, we are not getting banned from my own custom.

1447
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:45,360
I did not take it out of my integrity.

1448
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:48,540
Don't want to ban you because you're the host.

1449
01:51:49,540 --> 01:51:50,500
I'm the host.

1450
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:51,240
Tempo's the host.

1451
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:57,240
Do you think Tempo's gonna let me get away with it?

1452
01:51:57,300 --> 01:51:59,080
You know he doesn't let you guys get away with anything.

1453
01:52:00,500 --> 01:52:03,780
He has a fucking blacklist, Jen.

1454
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:04,880
He'll let you on the list.

1455
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:07,700
I'm gonna get on his list, Jen.

1456
01:52:08,580 --> 01:52:09,840
You'll get on his blacklist?

1457
01:52:10,580 --> 01:52:12,780
And you'll get on the blacklist too.

1458
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:16,340
A hundred thieves will be screaming for like a whole year.

1459
01:52:16,580 --> 01:52:17,140
Oh, here you go.

1460
01:52:17,700 --> 01:52:18,360
There's a charge rifle.

1461
01:52:18,680 --> 01:52:19,500
The worst sniper.

1462
01:52:19,700 --> 01:52:20,340
Another wingman.

1463
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:21,940
At least I can fight them off now.

1464
01:52:23,320 --> 01:52:24,200
Give me that ammo.

1465
01:52:24,380 --> 01:52:25,580
That's four wingmen.

1466
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:28,960
Come out, I'll tell ya.

1467
01:52:29,220 --> 01:52:29,880
Where do we go?

1468
01:52:30,420 --> 01:52:32,580
We're gonna go into zone... I think it's ending...

1469
01:52:35,100 --> 01:52:36,440
I think we should get this building.

1470
01:52:36,540 --> 01:52:39,660
If we can't, then maybe like this one of these...

1471
01:52:39,660 --> 01:52:40,940
We still don't have a sniper.

1472
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:47,500
Rule breakers should get an extra nerf.

1473
01:52:49,900 --> 01:52:53,240
If you break the rules, you get an extra nerf.

1474
01:52:54,760 --> 01:52:57,540
I'm down to cook something up for that if you're being serious.

1475
01:52:57,560 --> 01:52:58,240
Wait, really?

1476
01:52:58,280 --> 01:52:58,700
Who was it?

1477
01:52:58,720 --> 01:52:59,440
Who broke the rules?

1478
01:53:00,780 --> 01:53:02,260
Apparently it was Mel's team.

1479
01:53:02,540 --> 01:53:04,520
They said in the chat...

1480
01:53:07,300 --> 01:53:08,320
Who shot him?

1481
01:53:09,180 --> 01:53:12,440
I don't know who on Mel's team, but it was one tappy who got killed.

1482
01:53:13,420 --> 01:53:14,840
But they res'd him though, right?

1483
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:16,400
Yeah, I think they're good now.

1484
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:18,760
Mel said in the chat, we goofed.

1485
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:19,440
I'm so sorry.

1486
01:53:19,620 --> 01:53:20,920
Voice actor bloodlust.

1487
01:53:23,540 --> 01:53:27,880
If you know who exactly shot him, the one that killed Tappy...

1488
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:30,260
The one that killed Tappy should get the nerf.

1489
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:33,960
You can bring him in for an interview after and assess them a punishment.

1490
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:35,320
That's true!

1491
01:53:35,680 --> 01:53:36,860
We can do that!

1492
01:53:37,660 --> 01:53:38,400
That's cool.

1493
01:53:39,120 --> 01:53:40,580
That's execution style.

1494
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:43,000
Give him a one game punishment for shooting.

1495
01:53:44,580 --> 01:53:46,660
Just only the person who shot.

1496
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:48,940
We should do it and protect the princess.

1497
01:53:49,680 --> 01:53:52,120
Yeah, bring him in and literally interrogate him.

1498
01:53:52,180 --> 01:53:53,160
Be like, alright, so who was it?

1499
01:53:53,380 --> 01:53:54,460
Who fired the shot?

1500
01:53:55,460 --> 01:53:56,980
Who took the shot?

1501
01:53:57,880 --> 01:54:00,060
We told you to take that shot.

1502
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:02,340
Madness just took responsibility for it.

1503
01:54:02,340 --> 01:54:03,780
He said he was sorry and he did it.

1504
01:54:04,140 --> 01:54:05,860
But we're still gonna nerf him.

1505
01:54:06,340 --> 01:54:07,080
Oh yeah, perfect.

1506
01:54:08,300 --> 01:54:12,360
We're still gonna bring him down.

1507
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:14,600
It's fine.

1508
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:16,520
I'll set up your wall.

1509
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:19,020
Yeah, you and Wink decide to cook something.

1510
01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:20,040
Towards this way.

1511
01:54:24,440 --> 01:54:25,880
This one works for sure.

1512
01:54:26,900 --> 01:54:27,780
I still have a sniper.

1513
01:54:28,260 --> 01:54:30,580
I have a longbow with no scope.

1514
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:31,960
I have no sniper.

1515
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:34,480
We have no sniper out there?

1516
01:54:34,700 --> 01:54:36,400
I've been saying it like 4 times already.

1517
01:54:36,920 --> 01:54:38,180
Oh my god, we gotta loot.

1518
01:54:38,620 --> 01:54:40,540
I literally told you guys 3 times.

1519
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:41,480
4 times.

1520
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:43,940
Go into that building and loot.

1521
01:54:43,940 --> 01:54:45,760
I'm holding the line.

1522
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:47,980
Oh no, the zone closed.

1523
01:54:48,360 --> 01:54:50,900
The zone's closed.

1524
01:54:50,980 --> 01:54:51,420
Be careful.

1525
01:54:51,820 --> 01:54:54,000
Where are you gonna shoot us?

1526
01:54:54,060 --> 01:54:54,820
There's no way.

1527
01:54:55,620 --> 01:54:56,860
Fight on.

1528
01:54:58,780 --> 01:54:59,860
That is crazy.

1529
01:55:04,020 --> 01:55:06,780
You're like the guy that can carry 2 snipers.

1530
01:55:07,060 --> 01:55:10,060
This is bad.

1531
01:55:10,100 --> 01:55:10,620
I'm getting shot at.

1532
01:55:10,620 --> 01:55:11,540
Wait, where?

1533
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:13,400
West.

1534
01:55:14,620 --> 01:55:15,900
Can you guys get up?

1535
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:18,260
I'm gonna heal first.

1536
01:55:18,740 --> 01:55:19,480
I can get up.

1537
01:55:20,680 --> 01:55:21,760
They're flying on me, I think.

1538
01:55:22,220 --> 01:55:22,700
They are?

1539
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:27,800
Oh my god, they fucking beat the shit out of one of them.

1540
01:55:28,360 --> 01:55:28,720
I'm going up.

1541
01:55:33,620 --> 01:55:34,420
Jump off.

1542
01:55:35,140 --> 01:55:36,100
Come to me, puppy.

1543
01:55:36,580 --> 01:55:37,320
I got you, don't worry.

1544
01:55:37,320 --> 01:55:38,860
We got you.

1545
01:55:40,140 --> 01:55:42,700
Run at us, there's snipers.

1546
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:45,540
I'm blocking.

1547
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:47,080
I'm blocking.

1548
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:48,320
I got you.

1549
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:49,640
Come to us.

1550
01:55:51,160 --> 01:55:51,660
I'm ulting.

1551
01:55:53,540 --> 01:55:54,120
Nice, good ult.

1552
01:55:54,780 --> 01:55:55,580
Thank you.

1553
01:55:57,070 --> 01:55:58,420
We're so good.

1554
01:56:01,050 --> 01:56:01,940
Stay in here.

1555
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:03,560
Stay here.

1556
01:56:04,180 --> 01:56:05,060
Stay here.

1557
01:56:05,120 --> 01:56:06,140
They changed their ult.

1558
01:56:06,340 --> 01:56:07,840
Yeah, they do.

1559
01:56:12,380 --> 01:56:14,040
I lowkey wanna swap with you.

1560
01:56:14,260 --> 01:56:14,900
You want the charge?

1561
01:56:15,160 --> 01:56:15,620
No, that's fine.

1562
01:56:17,020 --> 01:56:19,580
Fine, fine, use the longbow.

1563
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:20,540
It's fine, I'm with charge.

1564
01:56:20,540 --> 01:56:22,680
You're a pro player.

1565
01:56:22,860 --> 01:56:24,740
I have to be good at every weapon.

1566
01:56:25,020 --> 01:56:25,820
Yes, exactly.

1567
01:56:26,700 --> 01:56:27,560
Look at them.

1568
01:56:28,760 --> 01:56:31,120
You have your fist, so that's fine.

1569
01:56:31,120 --> 01:56:33,060
I have lots of ammo, if you guys need ammo.

1570
01:56:33,060 --> 01:56:34,660
Yeah, you can be our ammo guy.

1571
01:56:35,060 --> 01:56:36,860
Yeah, I have attachments too.

1572
01:56:37,020 --> 01:56:37,760
You're a princess.

1573
01:56:38,420 --> 01:56:40,080
You're our temporary princess.

1574
01:56:42,820 --> 01:56:43,860
That's fine.

1575
01:56:48,230 --> 01:56:49,250
I'm getting pushed.

1576
01:56:50,470 --> 01:56:51,830
How are they gonna push them?

1577
01:56:51,910 --> 01:56:52,690
They're all snipers.

1578
01:56:53,530 --> 01:56:54,670
I'll push them.

1579
01:56:57,450 --> 01:57:02,730
Bro, there's one team that literally fucking punched a bunch of people down.

1580
01:57:03,070 --> 01:57:05,210
Do you guys have any batteries, by the way?

1581
01:57:05,410 --> 01:57:05,990
I have one.

1582
01:57:07,050 --> 01:57:09,150
You might as well just give it to me, you get double heal.

1583
01:57:09,750 --> 01:57:10,570
Oh, that's true.

1584
01:57:11,310 --> 01:57:12,030
Here's two.

1585
01:57:12,950 --> 01:57:14,050
Someone take that one.

1586
01:57:14,470 --> 01:57:14,710
I have two.

1587
01:57:16,910 --> 01:57:18,870
I feel like we gotta loot more.

1588
01:57:19,290 --> 01:57:21,770
We gotta loot for more stuff, I feel like.

1589
01:57:25,670 --> 01:57:27,450
Somebody wasn't looting that well.

1590
01:57:28,230 --> 01:57:29,930
I found five wingmen!

1591
01:57:34,610 --> 01:57:36,430
Somebody wasn't looting that well.

1592
01:57:36,530 --> 01:57:37,890
That's all I'm gonna say.

1593
01:57:43,730 --> 01:57:44,490
Crossing over to the building.

1594
01:57:45,930 --> 01:57:51,190
I can't believe our sniper, our guy that's well known for being a sniper does not have a sniper.

1595
01:57:56,270 --> 01:57:59,310
I think someone was like five wingmen and no maidens.

1596
01:57:59,570 --> 01:58:00,250
So sad.

1597
01:58:01,790 --> 01:58:03,090
I thought you guys were looting on guard.

1598
01:58:03,090 --> 01:58:03,830
I was!

1599
01:58:03,910 --> 01:58:04,870
I was the one that got the sniper!

1600
01:58:05,190 --> 01:58:06,250
I looted so much.

1601
01:58:06,630 --> 01:58:08,530
Maybe I can loot this for you.

1602
01:58:08,890 --> 01:58:10,050
Yeah, you go loot.

1603
01:58:10,250 --> 01:58:10,870
You'll be safe, right?

1604
01:58:11,390 --> 01:58:12,690
I'm gonna drop my sniper, hold up.

1605
01:58:13,350 --> 01:58:14,070
I'll be back.

1606
01:58:15,570 --> 01:58:17,430
There's like a... I'll take your sniper.

1607
01:58:17,670 --> 01:58:19,630
I'll take your sniper attachment, because there's a Lobo team.

1608
01:58:20,830 --> 01:58:21,270
Oh yeah, true.

1609
01:58:21,370 --> 01:58:21,930
Take him, please.

1610
01:58:23,290 --> 01:58:24,750
If they take my sniper, we're doomed.

1611
01:58:26,870 --> 01:58:28,790
We all share one sniper.

1612
01:58:28,790 --> 01:58:32,570
We all share this longbow together.

1613
01:58:32,570 --> 01:58:33,510
My team, my team, my team!

1614
01:58:33,770 --> 01:58:37,850
Yeah, each of us take one shot and then we just share it.

1615
01:58:39,090 --> 01:58:40,030
Nah, there's nothing.

1616
01:58:40,290 --> 01:58:41,170
Are you serious?

1617
01:58:41,450 --> 01:58:42,250
There's nothing?

1618
01:58:44,290 --> 01:58:44,930
That's crazy.

1619
01:58:45,090 --> 01:58:46,310
Is this the newest King's Canyon?

1620
01:58:46,510 --> 01:58:47,790
Are we back to OG King's Canyon?

1621
01:58:48,070 --> 01:58:49,490
Oh shit, I should not have peeked that.

1622
01:58:50,210 --> 01:58:52,450
I'm pretty sure this guy has a 4x8.

1623
01:58:55,350 --> 01:58:56,670
It's fine, we're just gonna walk across.

1624
01:58:57,190 --> 01:58:58,770
Alright, we can just walk now, actually.

1625
01:58:58,770 --> 01:59:00,570
The zone's closing anyway.

1626
01:59:01,970 --> 01:59:03,110
Do you have the sniper?

1627
01:59:03,410 --> 01:59:03,830
It's still there.

1628
01:59:04,030 --> 01:59:07,130
Yeah, I dropped your stock, right?

1629
01:59:09,550 --> 01:59:11,890
You definitely need it on your charge rifle.

1630
01:59:12,870 --> 01:59:14,850
Alright, put your next wall up here, Altair.

1631
01:59:15,490 --> 01:59:15,630
Okay.

1632
01:59:16,710 --> 01:59:17,870
Like, just here.

1633
01:59:18,530 --> 01:59:19,990
Yeah, there's a team right here on that building.

1634
01:59:20,110 --> 01:59:21,890
Just facing east, east side.

1635
01:59:24,730 --> 01:59:27,650
I'm gonna check under if there's any boxes.

1636
01:59:27,790 --> 01:59:28,690
Oh my god, what?

1637
01:59:29,990 --> 01:59:31,450
Alright, if I die, I die.

1638
01:59:32,070 --> 01:59:33,690
I'm just scared of the team coming behind us.

1639
01:59:33,770 --> 01:59:37,130
By the way, I had the best sniper so you guys had to come back to grab my sniper, at least.

1640
01:59:37,890 --> 01:59:38,550
I'm heading over.

1641
01:59:39,030 --> 01:59:40,090
I'm heading over here for loot.

1642
01:59:43,690 --> 01:59:44,490
There's names.

1643
01:59:45,730 --> 01:59:46,530
There's ammo.

1644
01:59:47,870 --> 01:59:49,130
There's just ammo.

1645
01:59:49,430 --> 01:59:50,030
There's nothing.

1646
01:59:50,870 --> 01:59:52,390
They fucking took everything.

1647
01:59:54,070 --> 01:59:55,630
Can you low bow up, please?

1648
01:59:55,630 --> 01:59:57,930
We should've had a low bow.

1649
01:59:58,250 --> 01:59:59,830
We should've had a low bow.

1650
02:00:01,350 --> 02:00:02,150
Is that a rifle?

1651
02:00:02,690 --> 02:00:03,630
Possibly a low bow.

1652
02:00:05,010 --> 02:00:06,370
I thought we were gonna get snipers, though.

1653
02:00:07,410 --> 02:00:09,150
Oh no, I have like...

1654
02:00:09,150 --> 02:00:10,130
I have two shield cells left.

1655
02:00:10,150 --> 02:00:18,130
I can't hit a shot with this charge rifle right now.

1656
02:00:18,810 --> 02:00:19,390
I hit a shot.

1657
02:00:21,310 --> 02:00:22,490
Oh, that guy has one HP.

1658
02:00:22,490 --> 02:00:23,610
That guy is so low.

1659
02:00:23,930 --> 02:00:25,110
I hit him, too.

1660
02:00:26,210 --> 02:00:26,970
Look at him.

1661
02:00:27,770 --> 02:00:29,470
I need to suck.

1662
02:00:30,610 --> 02:00:31,250
Is he being on us?

1663
02:00:32,790 --> 02:00:34,030
They're fighting us.

1664
02:00:34,070 --> 02:00:35,710
There's no way they're fighting us.

1665
02:00:37,050 --> 02:00:38,090
They're snipers.

1666
02:00:38,250 --> 02:00:39,990
Where are they?

1667
02:00:40,550 --> 02:00:41,470
They're above us.

1668
02:00:41,670 --> 02:00:43,250
They're right above us?

1669
02:00:43,390 --> 02:00:44,570
I cracked one.

1670
02:00:47,710 --> 02:00:48,710
I cracked another one.

1671
02:00:48,850 --> 02:00:49,410
I'm going up.

1672
02:00:49,410 --> 02:00:50,010
Cracked two.

1673
02:00:50,770 --> 02:00:52,870
I'm getting sniped by the others.

1674
02:00:52,910 --> 02:00:53,730
I have the shield.

1675
02:00:54,550 --> 02:00:55,470
Go, Jango!

1676
02:00:55,610 --> 02:00:56,750
Go, Jango!

1677
02:00:56,890 --> 02:00:57,670
I'm doing so much damage.

1678
02:01:01,010 --> 02:01:02,890
They're getting bombed.

1679
02:01:03,110 --> 02:01:04,570
Chill on the staircase.

1680
02:01:05,290 --> 02:01:05,750
I hit 98.

1681
02:01:08,130 --> 02:01:09,150
They bubbled, though.

1682
02:01:10,110 --> 02:01:10,410
I'm punching.

1683
02:01:11,250 --> 02:01:12,290
Don't you go in there.

1684
02:01:14,190 --> 02:01:15,650
They went left.

1685
02:01:15,830 --> 02:01:16,390
They're getting shot.

1686
02:01:16,390 --> 02:01:17,490
I'm nading them.

1687
02:01:17,510 --> 02:01:18,650
Look at these nades.

1688
02:01:20,870 --> 02:01:21,350
Drop your nades.

1689
02:01:22,010 --> 02:01:22,590
My bad.

1690
02:01:24,170 --> 02:01:26,010
I jumped off.

1691
02:01:26,790 --> 02:01:27,150
We're fine.

1692
02:01:27,230 --> 02:01:28,150
They're gone, guys.

1693
02:01:28,270 --> 02:01:28,730
Don't worry.

1694
02:01:31,610 --> 02:01:32,730
Nothing happened.

1695
02:01:35,750 --> 02:01:38,210
They're going to bash your knees.

1696
02:01:38,570 --> 02:01:39,850
They're going to do some madness.

1697
02:01:40,050 --> 02:01:40,490
My bad.

1698
02:01:40,810 --> 02:01:43,070
They're going to cut your knees off like madness.

1699
02:01:43,070 --> 02:01:43,430
They're going to cut your knees off like madness.

1700
02:01:44,930 --> 02:01:46,710
I can get a floor in this shit.

1701
02:01:53,990 --> 02:01:55,030
I don't have shields.

1702
02:01:56,750 --> 02:01:58,390
I have 13 souls.

1703
02:01:58,510 --> 02:01:59,730
I have zero.

1704
02:02:00,410 --> 02:02:01,090
I peaked too much.

1705
02:02:02,490 --> 02:02:03,290
We have...

1706
02:02:03,290 --> 02:02:05,630
How the fuck did you find all these shields?

1707
02:02:06,830 --> 02:02:07,450
We're going to go underneath.

1708
02:02:08,190 --> 02:02:08,730
I'm ready.

1709
02:02:09,850 --> 02:02:10,710
We can go to their spot.

1710
02:02:10,710 --> 02:02:11,570
Come follow me.

1711
02:02:12,990 --> 02:02:14,430
Can you bubble me?

1712
02:02:15,450 --> 02:02:16,010
Bubble?

1713
02:02:17,390 --> 02:02:18,790
Wait a minute.

1714
02:02:19,450 --> 02:02:19,630
Walk here.

1715
02:02:21,070 --> 02:02:22,410
You mean by bubble?

1716
02:02:22,570 --> 02:02:23,310
Here's a suck though.

1717
02:02:25,110 --> 02:02:26,490
Put the wall down this way.

1718
02:02:26,630 --> 02:02:26,810
West.

1719
02:02:28,450 --> 02:02:29,110
Put it down.

1720
02:02:30,070 --> 02:02:31,010
We're inside though.

1721
02:02:33,350 --> 02:02:34,110
That's fine.

1722
02:02:34,310 --> 02:02:35,190
You still have us.

1723
02:02:35,410 --> 02:02:36,510
Come to us.

1724
02:02:36,510 --> 02:02:36,710
Yeah.

1725
02:02:39,130 --> 02:02:40,350
They can't do anything.

1726
02:02:40,450 --> 02:02:41,110
They're going to break it.

1727
02:02:41,890 --> 02:02:43,150
They can do something.

1728
02:02:44,950 --> 02:02:46,130
We can play on here actually.

1729
02:02:46,350 --> 02:02:46,930
I'm going to go there now.

1730
02:02:48,250 --> 02:02:49,010
Come to me.

1731
02:02:50,390 --> 02:02:51,310
He's not peaking anymore.

1732
02:02:51,470 --> 02:02:52,190
You go first.

1733
02:02:54,010 --> 02:02:54,450
I'm okay.

1734
02:02:56,950 --> 02:02:58,170
I think we're going to run out.

1735
02:02:58,290 --> 02:02:59,350
We should have had a low bar.

1736
02:02:59,850 --> 02:03:01,330
We're going to run out.

1737
02:03:02,470 --> 02:03:03,170
I have ammo.

1738
02:03:03,170 --> 02:03:04,430
I'm dropping ammo.

1739
02:03:05,270 --> 02:03:05,890
We're fine.

1740
02:03:07,330 --> 02:03:08,290
We're so safe.

1741
02:03:08,350 --> 02:03:09,250
I feel so safe.

1742
02:03:09,970 --> 02:03:11,050
I'm hiding in a corner.

1743
02:03:13,150 --> 02:03:14,790
Maybe we can get to the last zone.

1744
02:03:14,870 --> 02:03:17,290
When we get to the last zone, you can start brawling at people.

1745
02:03:17,490 --> 02:03:18,550
It's my time.

1746
02:03:20,810 --> 02:03:24,810
Maybe the last zone will be people who are all snipers.

1747
02:03:25,010 --> 02:03:26,670
We can get low ground on this building.

1748
02:03:27,890 --> 02:03:28,830
There's a death box.

1749
02:03:29,690 --> 02:03:30,370
There's a death box.

1750
02:03:30,370 --> 02:03:31,070
I'm going to ult.

1751
02:03:31,270 --> 02:03:31,630
Are you ready?

1752
02:03:32,430 --> 02:03:32,950
Come.

1753
02:03:35,110 --> 02:03:36,150
Follow me.

1754
02:03:36,430 --> 02:03:37,850
There's someone going in there now.

1755
02:03:37,890 --> 02:03:38,450
No way.

1756
02:03:40,310 --> 02:03:40,810
They're fighting.

1757
02:03:42,030 --> 02:03:42,550
Come.

1758
02:03:43,290 --> 02:03:44,370
Follow me.

1759
02:03:46,430 --> 02:03:47,470
On us.

1760
02:03:49,130 --> 02:03:49,890
It's time.

1761
02:03:49,970 --> 02:03:50,510
This is it.

1762
02:03:51,490 --> 02:03:52,610
It's time to start meleeing.

1763
02:03:52,710 --> 02:03:52,970
Chill.

1764
02:03:55,150 --> 02:03:58,090
It's time to start meleeing.

1765
02:03:58,090 --> 02:03:59,210
I found one.

1766
02:03:59,390 --> 02:04:00,530
I killed one.

1767
02:04:00,910 --> 02:04:01,990
I got one.

1768
02:04:02,350 --> 02:04:04,190
I got one.

1769
02:04:05,210 --> 02:04:09,890
It's time to start meleeing.

1770
02:04:09,890 --> 02:04:10,810
You can res me.

1771
02:04:11,450 --> 02:04:11,610
No.

1772
02:04:12,870 --> 02:04:13,770
This is it.

1773
02:04:16,710 --> 02:04:17,190
Just live.

1774
02:04:17,610 --> 02:04:18,870
I'm safe.

1775
02:04:18,930 --> 02:04:20,610
I'm safe right here in the corner.

1776
02:04:21,090 --> 02:04:22,070
I'm safer.

1777
02:04:22,710 --> 02:04:23,750
You can res me.

1778
02:04:23,750 --> 02:04:24,770
You can res me.

1779
02:04:24,770 --> 02:04:26,030
I'm so safe.

1780
02:04:26,490 --> 02:04:28,830
I can't get over there.

1781
02:04:28,970 --> 02:04:29,930
Don't come back.

1782
02:04:30,530 --> 02:04:30,990
It's dangerous.

1783
02:04:31,130 --> 02:04:31,770
Don't come back.

1784
02:04:31,970 --> 02:04:33,710
Never come back.

1785
02:04:34,050 --> 02:04:34,830
Never come back.

1786
02:04:35,710 --> 02:04:36,550
I'm scared.

1787
02:04:36,970 --> 02:04:38,150
I'm punching.

1788
02:04:39,630 --> 02:04:40,230
No.

1789
02:04:40,750 --> 02:04:42,490
There's so many people here.

1790
02:04:44,450 --> 02:04:46,390
Why didn't I get a single sniper?

1791
02:04:49,090 --> 02:04:50,170
Five wingmen.

1792
02:04:50,170 --> 02:04:50,610
I'm fine.

1793
02:04:51,050 --> 02:04:53,370
If I had a better sniper, I ain't gonna lie.

1794
02:04:54,990 --> 02:04:56,350
Oh my god.

1795
02:04:56,630 --> 02:04:59,050
I'm gonna take that 85 damage to my grave.

1796
02:05:00,950 --> 02:05:02,450
That's an 85 melee.

1797
02:05:03,530 --> 02:05:05,050
That's actually crazy.

1798
02:05:05,070 --> 02:05:06,230
I fought a hard fight.

1799
02:05:06,330 --> 02:05:07,150
I went down fighting.

1800
02:05:07,350 --> 02:05:10,430
If they don't take all my guns, I'll take their lives.

1801
02:05:13,170 --> 02:05:15,030
I got two weapons right here.

1802
02:05:15,330 --> 02:05:17,950
All I'm saying is the moment you got a sniper, it was over.

1803
02:05:17,950 --> 02:05:19,590
You should've stuck with your fists.

1804
02:05:19,890 --> 02:05:20,750
You should've...

1805
02:05:22,430 --> 02:05:23,530
Oh my god.

1806
02:05:23,570 --> 02:05:24,910
We got killed by the Gooner gang.

1807
02:05:25,490 --> 02:05:25,950
It counts.

1808
02:05:27,970 --> 02:05:28,930
Five wingmen.

1809
02:05:32,350 --> 02:05:33,770
It's sniper, dude.

1810
02:05:34,550 --> 02:05:36,070
Jen, you died to the Gooner gang.

1811
02:05:36,970 --> 02:05:37,250
I did.

1812
02:05:37,250 --> 02:05:38,710
We died to the Gooner gang.

1813
02:05:40,050 --> 02:05:41,010
Altair didn't.

1814
02:05:41,010 --> 02:05:43,050
Altair didn't die to the Gooner gang, at least.

1815
02:05:45,050 --> 02:05:48,170
I died to some random pathfinder in the other building, I think.

1816
02:05:48,770 --> 02:05:49,290
What?

1817
02:05:51,910 --> 02:05:54,070
Do they know we...

1818
02:05:54,070 --> 02:05:56,850
Do they know we...

1819
02:05:56,850 --> 02:05:59,790
No, nobody caught your nade mistake.

1820
02:06:00,590 --> 02:06:01,750
Nobody caught it.

1821
02:06:02,050 --> 02:06:02,510
So you're safe.

1822
02:06:02,530 --> 02:06:02,830
Nobody's watching.

1823
02:06:03,090 --> 02:06:04,290
Yeah, nobody was watching you.

1824
02:06:04,710 --> 02:06:05,390
Nobody watched.

1825
02:06:09,170 --> 02:06:11,230
It's okay, I'll turn my aimbot on.

1826
02:06:11,610 --> 02:06:12,650
I realized I didn't have that.

1827
02:06:12,650 --> 02:06:12,970
Oh my god.

1828
02:06:14,450 --> 02:06:15,890
And nobody watched you.

1829
02:06:16,230 --> 02:06:17,650
Nah, for real though, we would've been chilling.

1830
02:06:17,830 --> 02:06:19,030
I swear to god, we would've been chilling.

1831
02:06:20,030 --> 02:06:20,570
How so?

1832
02:06:22,030 --> 02:06:23,450
We would've won this zone, I swear to god.

1833
02:06:23,770 --> 02:06:25,610
If we lived there, we'd actually win.

1834
02:06:25,830 --> 02:06:28,750
If we lived there and if Altair had two guns.

1835
02:06:29,030 --> 02:06:33,690
If Altair had two guns.

1836
02:06:33,710 --> 02:06:35,090
Just give me a sliver of hope, please.

1837
02:06:35,250 --> 02:06:40,390
There's no way we looted from stadium to Blossom Drive on Neon and we didn't get a sniper.

1838
02:06:40,390 --> 02:06:40,770
Oh man.

1839
02:06:41,550 --> 02:06:43,110
That is insane.

1840
02:06:43,470 --> 02:06:45,670
We should've had Loba.

1841
02:06:46,630 --> 02:06:47,270
Look at this.

1842
02:06:47,450 --> 02:06:49,570
Look at the Gooner gang with the Kraber.

1843
02:06:49,990 --> 02:06:52,150
The Gooner gang got the Kraber.

1844
02:06:54,830 --> 02:06:56,410
That could've been us.

1845
02:06:57,150 --> 02:06:58,790
That could've been us.

1846
02:06:59,570 --> 02:07:01,450
To be fair, there's only like two Loba teams.

1847
02:07:01,830 --> 02:07:02,250
Really?

1848
02:07:02,910 --> 02:07:04,090
How do you know?

1849
02:07:05,230 --> 02:07:06,330
Because I'm not seeing Lobalt.

1850
02:07:07,390 --> 02:07:07,750
Oh.

1851
02:07:08,270 --> 02:07:09,650
This team I'm watching is Kat.

1852
02:07:10,030 --> 02:07:12,910
I don't know, Loba's good, but I thought we'd get a sniper.

1853
02:07:13,530 --> 02:07:15,550
Yeah, you know with all the houses there.

1854
02:07:19,890 --> 02:07:22,370
I looted like five and I got one last second.

1855
02:07:22,450 --> 02:07:23,250
It was a charge rifle.

1856
02:07:23,950 --> 02:07:25,210
That is insane.

1857
02:07:27,130 --> 02:07:27,850
That's crazy.

1858
02:07:27,870 --> 02:07:29,530
I actually killed the other team that landed on us.

1859
02:07:29,590 --> 02:07:30,710
I killed them if I had the longbow.

1860
02:07:31,530 --> 02:07:34,130
And I killed this team underneath if I had the longbow.

1861
02:07:34,130 --> 02:07:35,210
Oh, I'm so sad.

1862
02:07:37,290 --> 02:07:38,250
That's insane.

1863
02:07:40,770 --> 02:07:42,470
Oh my god, I hope the Gooner gang wins.

1864
02:07:42,510 --> 02:07:43,390
We're gonna see the end zone though.

1865
02:07:45,830 --> 02:07:47,050
What is the end zone?

1866
02:07:50,370 --> 02:07:51,450
Oh my god.

1867
02:07:53,450 --> 02:07:54,950
Look at the sniper.

1868
02:07:55,610 --> 02:07:56,690
Bro, look at the sniper.

1869
02:07:58,630 --> 02:07:59,110
Eww.

1870
02:07:59,110 --> 02:07:59,590
Stinky.

1871
02:08:00,210 --> 02:08:02,150
Oh my god, the cost of life.

1872
02:08:02,150 --> 02:08:03,250
Oh my god, they just got bombed.

1873
02:08:03,310 --> 02:08:03,690
They got bombed.

1874
02:08:04,290 --> 02:08:07,090
They got fucking bombed.

1875
02:08:07,090 --> 02:08:08,090
It's a massacre.

1876
02:08:08,610 --> 02:08:10,850
The end zone is going crazy right now.

1877
02:08:12,370 --> 02:08:14,870
Oh my god, look at all these.

1878
02:08:15,250 --> 02:08:15,950
Oh my god.

1879
02:08:16,430 --> 02:08:17,630
What is going on?

1880
02:08:17,670 --> 02:08:18,630
It's all just snipers.

1881
02:08:18,710 --> 02:08:21,190
Oh my god.

1882
02:08:22,450 --> 02:08:25,050
My friend is literally just trying to live.

1883
02:08:27,210 --> 02:08:30,940
All the snipers in the...

1884
02:08:30,940 --> 02:08:32,120
The Gooner gang down.

1885
02:08:32,720 --> 02:08:33,540
Who won?

1886
02:08:34,600 --> 02:08:35,540
Valk team.

1887
02:08:35,880 --> 02:08:36,760
Who's playing Valk?

1888
02:08:36,860 --> 02:08:38,260
Who the fuck is playing Valk?

1889
02:08:47,220 --> 02:08:49,000
Valk, Gibraltar, Newcastle.

1890
02:08:49,780 --> 02:08:50,520
Goons out.

1891
02:08:53,120 --> 02:08:54,860
The Gooners got GFP.

1892
02:08:54,860 --> 02:08:55,880
Maybe the next game will be better.

1893
02:09:02,220 --> 02:09:03,440
Who was it?

1894
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:04,500
There's no way.

1895
02:09:08,440 --> 02:09:09,140
Oh Goon.

1896
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:13,640
Hibernation.

1897
02:09:14,660 --> 02:09:16,640
The hibernation team won.

1898
02:09:16,820 --> 02:09:18,260
It is...

1899
02:09:18,260 --> 02:09:23,800
Matou, Kahaku, Yumyumeriku, and Exphysic.

1900
02:09:23,800 --> 02:09:23,820
Yumyumeriku, and Exphysic.

1901
02:09:24,140 --> 02:09:24,820
Zizuzu.

1902
02:09:25,340 --> 02:09:28,480
Where did you get the extra Z in?

1903
02:09:28,660 --> 02:09:30,260
Yeah, where did you get the Z in?

1904
02:09:30,260 --> 02:09:34,980
Who the fuck?

1905
02:09:35,100 --> 02:09:35,900
Oh my god.

1906
02:09:35,980 --> 02:09:39,760
Our PR team got 16 kills.

1907
02:09:40,680 --> 02:09:41,160
Holy...

1908
02:09:41,160 --> 02:09:43,740
You guys should be nerfed.

1909
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:46,820
Give them the worst possible punishment.

1910
02:09:49,300 --> 02:09:50,420
Oh my god.

1911
02:09:51,020 --> 02:09:51,380
Alright.

1912
02:09:52,240 --> 02:09:53,700
Gotta go to the interview stage.

1913
02:09:53,800 --> 02:09:54,840
I'll see you guys soon.

1914
02:09:55,540 --> 02:09:56,460
What are we playing now?

1915
02:09:57,200 --> 02:09:58,160
Protect the Princess.

1916
02:09:58,740 --> 02:09:59,460
Oh, it's Hide and Seek.

1917
02:09:59,660 --> 02:10:00,240
Oh, it's Hide and Seek.

1918
02:10:01,200 --> 02:10:02,340
It's Hide and Seek.

1919
02:10:02,440 --> 02:10:03,200
We're gonna be seekers.

1920
02:10:03,380 --> 02:10:03,780
Alright.

1921
02:10:05,300 --> 02:10:07,160
I'll see you guys soon.

1922
02:10:08,500 --> 02:10:09,880
I'm down as well.

1923
02:10:11,060 --> 02:10:12,760
We came up with a punishment.

1924
02:10:13,060 --> 02:10:16,660
Okay, do we talk to the winners first or do we fucking bring madness in?

1925
02:10:16,840 --> 02:10:17,680
Winners first.

1926
02:10:19,180 --> 02:10:19,680
Hibernation.

1927
02:10:19,920 --> 02:10:20,940
Okay, I'll let them know.

1928
02:10:21,280 --> 02:10:22,780
Holy shit, she's actually won that.

1929
02:10:24,120 --> 02:10:25,120
Holy shit.

1930
02:10:26,560 --> 02:10:27,620
That was crazy.

1931
02:10:27,620 --> 02:10:28,240
That was crazy.

1932
02:10:28,880 --> 02:10:31,120
Sniping in such a tiny ass zone.

1933
02:10:33,360 --> 02:10:38,060
Dash, do you know from the winning team, do you know if any of them stream on Twitch?

1934
02:10:41,960 --> 02:10:42,620
Let's see.

1935
02:10:43,180 --> 02:10:45,120
Wait, does Azuzu stream on Twitch?

1936
02:10:45,500 --> 02:10:47,880
She does stream on Twitch.

1937
02:10:48,140 --> 02:10:48,400
Yeah.

1938
02:10:49,480 --> 02:10:50,320
Can you?

1939
02:10:50,560 --> 02:10:52,260
I wanna go watch the VOD of how they won that game.

1940
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:55,680
Yeah, that was crazy.

1941
02:10:55,680 --> 02:10:57,140
Because the RPS team almost won.

1942
02:10:57,260 --> 02:10:59,840
They got 16 kills.

1943
02:11:01,720 --> 02:11:04,080
You wanna hear the punishment we're gonna give Madness?

1944
02:11:04,620 --> 02:11:05,600
What is it?

1945
02:11:06,400 --> 02:11:07,840
70 FOV as well.

1946
02:11:08,380 --> 02:11:15,580
And then his shooting button on his mouse and his aiming button have to be reversed in the settings.

1947
02:11:16,840 --> 02:11:18,420
So hold or toggle, you mean?

1948
02:11:20,180 --> 02:11:22,920
No, like most people click the left button to shoot.

1949
02:11:22,920 --> 02:11:25,380
Left click would be shooting, but he's gonna be right click shoot.

1950
02:11:34,900 --> 02:11:38,120
Alright, let's get it.

1951
02:11:38,180 --> 02:11:39,120
Is hibernation in yet?

1952
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:40,240
Yeah.

1953
02:11:40,460 --> 02:11:41,780
Yeah, it can join.

1954
02:11:42,640 --> 02:11:44,060
Wait, why is Wig deafened?

1955
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:46,260
What he's fucking trying to do.

1956
02:11:46,260 --> 02:11:46,840
What?

1957
02:11:51,510 --> 02:11:53,370
Wait, what's Wig doing?

1958
02:11:54,770 --> 02:11:55,270
I don't know.

1959
02:11:55,390 --> 02:11:56,230
You think I know?

1960
02:11:56,490 --> 02:11:57,870
Wait, wait, wait.

1961
02:11:58,090 --> 02:11:59,750
They're like roommates with him.

1962
02:12:00,390 --> 02:12:02,950
He doesn't even answer my text messages.

1963
02:12:03,310 --> 02:12:05,190
Have you tried knocking the door?

1964
02:12:06,670 --> 02:12:07,990
There we go, there we go.

1965
02:12:08,310 --> 02:12:09,550
My bad, I was watching.

1966
02:12:10,690 --> 02:12:11,150
Hello.

1967
02:12:12,070 --> 02:12:12,590
Congratulations.

1968
02:12:13,810 --> 02:12:14,690
Thank you.

1969
02:12:14,910 --> 02:12:15,650
Thank you so much.

1970
02:12:16,550 --> 02:12:17,450
Arigatou gozaimasu.

1971
02:12:18,930 --> 02:12:19,670
Arigatou gozaimasu.

1972
02:12:20,210 --> 02:12:21,590
I have a question for you, Kawaku.

1973
02:12:21,650 --> 02:12:22,250
I have a question.

1974
02:12:23,250 --> 02:12:26,890
Was that finisher intentional in that last circle?

1975
02:12:27,150 --> 02:12:29,430
Or was that an alpha move?

1976
02:12:29,530 --> 02:12:30,250
Did you miss click?

1977
02:12:30,370 --> 02:12:30,630
What was the situation there?

1978
02:12:30,630 --> 02:12:31,910
Wait, you did a finisher?

1979
02:12:32,890 --> 02:12:35,610
In the middle of the endgame.

1980
02:12:35,770 --> 02:12:36,930
With 37 people alive.

1981
02:12:37,450 --> 02:12:38,330
The finisher got popped.

1982
02:12:38,330 --> 02:12:39,310
Wait, they won?

1983
02:12:41,130 --> 02:12:41,650
Yes.

1984
02:12:41,650 --> 02:12:41,710
Yes.

1985
02:12:44,370 --> 02:12:46,750
So was that the game plan or was that a miss click for you?

1986
02:12:46,970 --> 02:12:48,010
Oh yeah, for sure.

1987
02:12:48,110 --> 02:12:49,870
That's totally intentional.

1988
02:12:50,110 --> 02:12:50,390
Yeah.

1989
02:12:51,490 --> 02:12:53,190
Was that your strats or what?

1990
02:12:54,310 --> 02:13:01,330
Okay, to be honest I was trying to get onto the evac tower, but I accidentally clicked onto somebody.

1991
02:13:03,310 --> 02:13:07,790
Are you aware that your Gibraltar ultimate did 700 damage in that late game?

1992
02:13:08,610 --> 02:13:09,070
Really?

1993
02:13:09,070 --> 02:13:10,670
Yeah, 700.

1994
02:13:11,410 --> 02:13:16,010
I did hear a bunch of crack, crack, crack, but I didn't think it was 700.

1995
02:13:16,390 --> 02:13:17,010
That was a lot.

1996
02:13:17,510 --> 02:13:18,270
That's a lot of damage.

1997
02:13:18,510 --> 02:13:19,330
You guys did a great job.

1998
02:13:19,410 --> 02:13:19,810
That was fire.

1999
02:13:20,010 --> 02:13:21,190
That was such a fun ending to watch.

2000
02:13:22,270 --> 02:13:25,290
It would be so funny if I actually finished the finisher though.

2001
02:13:25,730 --> 02:13:27,510
I know, I wish you committed to be honest.

2002
02:13:28,370 --> 02:13:30,570
It was full commitment towards it.

2003
02:13:32,450 --> 02:13:33,630
That was so good.

2004
02:13:34,030 --> 02:13:35,610
What's the game plan for game 5 now?

2005
02:13:35,750 --> 02:13:36,830
We're going to protect the princess.

2006
02:13:36,830 --> 02:13:39,490
Hide and seek for game 4, my bad.

2007
02:13:39,710 --> 02:13:40,510
What's the game plan here?

2008
02:13:40,530 --> 02:13:42,530
Any character comps you guys are going to run for game 4?

2009
02:13:42,750 --> 02:13:44,390
And run away from Doki?

2010
02:13:46,250 --> 02:13:50,290
We have Shizu-san as our IGL, so I'm going to let him explain.

2011
02:13:50,850 --> 02:13:51,870
Yes, go for it.

2012
02:13:52,210 --> 02:13:54,610
Shizu-san, please explain the game plan.

2013
02:13:54,770 --> 02:13:55,930
The game plan for game 5.

2014
02:13:56,810 --> 02:13:58,350
IGL, please explain it.

2015
02:13:59,170 --> 02:14:04,510
Well, I'm going to take the middle of the map and if I just keep going, I'll be in the middle of the map.

2016
02:14:05,010 --> 02:14:05,430
Alright.

2017
02:14:07,690 --> 02:14:16,910
So, he's planning to just sit in the middle of the zone and just tank with a Newcastle Q and a Gibby Q.

2018
02:14:17,230 --> 02:14:17,550
That's it.

2019
02:14:17,570 --> 02:14:18,350
That's his plan.

2020
02:14:18,370 --> 02:14:21,390
Okay, so thanks for telling me about that.

2021
02:14:22,350 --> 02:14:22,830
Because...

2022
02:14:22,830 --> 02:14:24,810
I didn't think about that, my bad.

2023
02:14:25,370 --> 02:14:26,210
I wouldn't jump me.

2024
02:14:27,750 --> 02:14:29,170
I wouldn't jump me.

2025
02:14:29,350 --> 02:14:29,730
That's my fault.

2026
02:14:29,730 --> 02:14:29,750
That's my fault.

2027
02:14:35,330 --> 02:14:37,610
We gotta change our plan now.

2028
02:14:39,930 --> 02:14:42,190
That was actually a fake plan.

2029
02:14:42,350 --> 02:14:42,810
Fake plan.

2030
02:14:43,090 --> 02:14:45,070
I see, I see.

2031
02:14:46,090 --> 02:14:48,570
But we'll go to the middle just in case, yeah?

2032
02:14:49,010 --> 02:14:49,690
Yeah, yeah.

2033
02:14:50,990 --> 02:14:52,150
Very smart.

2034
02:14:54,130 --> 02:14:55,190
That's so good.

2035
02:14:55,430 --> 02:14:58,590
I forgot the organizer of the tournament was literally in this call.

2036
02:14:59,430 --> 02:15:00,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2037
02:15:00,910 --> 02:15:02,750
That was my question right there.

2038
02:15:03,590 --> 02:15:05,250
Listen, I'm not a professional.

2039
02:15:05,410 --> 02:15:05,950
I'm trying my best.

2040
02:15:08,450 --> 02:15:09,590
Dude, congratulations to those guys.

2041
02:15:09,650 --> 02:15:11,330
That was actually such a fun game to watch.

2042
02:15:11,430 --> 02:15:12,790
One of the best ones of the night so far for sure.

2043
02:15:15,110 --> 02:15:16,030
Yeah, no worries.

2044
02:15:16,530 --> 02:15:19,010
Good luck in game four and stay away from Doki.

2045
02:15:19,150 --> 02:15:19,610
She's scary.

2046
02:15:21,690 --> 02:15:25,930
Alright, we'll make sure one of us will be in the middle just to see if it was fake.

2047
02:15:27,350 --> 02:15:27,830
Okay.

2048
02:15:28,890 --> 02:15:30,090
Meet you in the middle.

2049
02:15:30,470 --> 02:15:32,430
See you guys in the middle, guys.

2050
02:15:34,470 --> 02:15:35,430
Bye-bye.

2051
02:15:35,790 --> 02:15:36,630
Thank you.

2052
02:15:36,850 --> 02:15:37,730
Arigato gozaimasu.

2053
02:15:37,970 --> 02:15:38,810
Arigato gozaimasu.

2054
02:15:40,430 --> 02:15:41,810
Alright, now are we bringing madness?

2055
02:15:42,290 --> 02:15:43,350
Yeah, we're bringing madness.

2056
02:15:43,550 --> 02:15:44,670
It's execution style.

2057
02:15:44,870 --> 02:15:46,690
Okay, madness is in...

2058
02:15:47,450 --> 02:15:48,930
Okay, at madness...

2059
02:15:48,930 --> 02:15:50,390
Who's gonna lay the hammer?

2060
02:15:50,750 --> 02:15:51,230
You are.

2061
02:15:51,270 --> 02:15:52,230
You have the plan, right?

2062
02:15:52,230 --> 02:15:53,210
I think you should too.

2063
02:15:53,250 --> 02:15:54,890
You've been really excited about the punishment.

2064
02:15:55,270 --> 02:15:57,990
I think this might be...

2065
02:15:57,990 --> 02:16:01,750
I mean, you've been the one really discussing about what he should be facing as a punishment.

2066
02:16:01,950 --> 02:16:02,810
So I think this should be...

2067
02:16:04,650 --> 02:16:05,050
What's...

2068
02:16:05,590 --> 02:16:07,230
Yo, what's enemy highlight?

2069
02:16:08,210 --> 02:16:08,550
What do you mean?

2070
02:16:09,310 --> 02:16:14,930
When the recon character, ADS, that highlights his show up, like the Bloodhound's gun.

2071
02:16:16,450 --> 02:16:18,230
Well, you guys can't play...

2072
02:16:18,670 --> 02:16:19,070
Yeah.

2073
02:16:19,070 --> 02:16:20,710
I won't play Vantage.

2074
02:16:21,230 --> 02:16:21,570
Yeah.

2075
02:16:22,010 --> 02:16:24,570
So you won't get that scanned, right?

2076
02:16:25,490 --> 02:16:26,930
Alright, madness is here.

2077
02:16:27,410 --> 02:16:28,070
Madness is here.

2078
02:16:29,330 --> 02:16:30,250
I'm here for my punishment.

2079
02:16:30,630 --> 02:16:31,510
Madness, how you doing?

2080
02:16:32,170 --> 02:16:32,910
I've been better.

2081
02:16:34,490 --> 02:16:36,270
Daddy's about to drop the hammer on you.

2082
02:16:36,670 --> 02:16:40,150
Dude, the ADS instinct just turned on.

2083
02:16:40,290 --> 02:16:41,530
I just went free kill, free kill.

2084
02:16:41,910 --> 02:16:42,990
I'm like telling my team.

2085
02:16:43,710 --> 02:16:43,930
Ah.

2086
02:16:48,570 --> 02:16:49,050
Unfortunately...

2087
02:16:49,050 --> 02:16:50,950
Unfortunately, actions have punishments.

2088
02:16:51,190 --> 02:16:51,730
Yes.

2089
02:16:52,190 --> 02:16:54,470
It was voted on here by the council.

2090
02:16:54,930 --> 02:16:55,430
That was just you.

2091
02:16:55,710 --> 02:16:58,590
It wasn't just me.

2092
02:16:58,770 --> 02:16:59,570
Majority agree.

2093
02:17:00,770 --> 02:17:02,870
This is for game 6, by the way.

2094
02:17:02,990 --> 02:17:03,970
Game 6 punishment.

2095
02:17:04,430 --> 02:17:21,570
For the last game, game number 6, you will be sentenced to 70 FOV and you have to switch your left click, which is your shooting button and your right click, which is your aiming button.

2096
02:17:21,670 --> 02:17:22,730
You have to reverse them.

2097
02:17:22,990 --> 02:17:27,110
So you're going to be shooting with the right button on your mouse and aiming in with the left.

2098
02:17:28,850 --> 02:17:30,170
Who cooked that up?

2099
02:17:30,730 --> 02:17:31,590
Who do you think?

2100
02:17:32,590 --> 02:17:34,870
I mean, it was a share, yeah.

2101
02:17:35,310 --> 02:17:37,150
If you want to punch us, we just have a controller.

2102
02:17:37,770 --> 02:17:38,630
Do you have a controller?

2103
02:17:39,490 --> 02:17:41,210
Wait, why did I say that?

2104
02:17:41,450 --> 02:17:42,450
Do you actually have one?

2105
02:17:43,090 --> 02:17:44,230
I have a...

2106
02:17:44,230 --> 02:17:46,290
No, you know, the first idea is fine.

2107
02:17:46,390 --> 02:17:47,150
The first idea is fine.

2108
02:17:49,790 --> 02:17:51,630
70 FOV and switch the buttons.

2109
02:17:51,850 --> 02:17:56,510
And let's just say the person who cooked that one up, their name rhymes with Loki.

2110
02:17:57,790 --> 02:17:59,450
Oh my god, Roki?

2111
02:18:01,470 --> 02:18:02,730
Oh my god, Roki?

2112
02:18:04,250 --> 02:18:05,770
Game 6, by the way.

2113
02:18:05,870 --> 02:18:06,570
Only game 6.

2114
02:18:07,290 --> 02:18:09,610
So you have two more games before we get there.

2115
02:18:10,330 --> 02:18:11,650
I gotta write down these.

2116
02:18:11,650 --> 02:18:15,070
Good luck, good luck, madness.

2117
02:18:16,210 --> 02:18:20,890
And I was like, God already made me 5'4", and now I'm getting punished even more.

2118
02:18:21,350 --> 02:18:22,270
What is happening?

2119
02:18:22,490 --> 02:18:24,190
Welcome to a Doki Bird tournament.

2120
02:18:24,890 --> 02:18:26,550
I hope you enjoy yourself.

2121
02:18:26,750 --> 02:18:29,170
It's not my fault!

2122
02:18:29,930 --> 02:18:30,490
Hello?

2123
02:18:32,370 --> 02:18:37,050
Get in the comms with Doki and she's salivating from the mouth and handing you a punishment.

2124
02:18:37,230 --> 02:18:37,950
What do you want me to do?

2125
02:18:37,950 --> 02:18:39,530
Is this true?

2126
02:18:40,090 --> 02:18:41,790
No, that's not true.

2127
02:18:41,930 --> 02:18:44,670
I was like, if you want to, it's really up to you.

2128
02:18:45,030 --> 02:18:46,570
This might be a VOD checker.

2129
02:18:48,290 --> 02:18:50,950
Alright, well, good luck, buddy.

2130
02:18:52,170 --> 02:18:54,010
So you're good, I believe in you.

2131
02:18:54,450 --> 02:18:54,990
Love you.

2132
02:18:55,350 --> 02:18:56,130
Love you too.

2133
02:18:57,670 --> 02:18:58,250
Alright, Tempo.

2134
02:19:00,290 --> 02:19:04,690
There's another setting for you that you have to turn off enemy highlights.

2135
02:19:04,690 --> 02:19:06,250
Apparently, it's not just recon.

2136
02:19:06,410 --> 02:19:08,470
If you get close enough, everyone has it.

2137
02:19:08,570 --> 02:19:09,810
Okay, yeah, I can turn it off.

2138
02:19:10,650 --> 02:19:11,590
Yeah, that's no problem.

2139
02:19:11,810 --> 02:19:12,990
Alright, I'll go back to IRS.

2140
02:19:13,330 --> 02:19:14,710
I'll see you guys later.

2141
02:19:15,430 --> 02:19:20,710
Wait, before you go, where are you guys landing?

2142
02:19:21,450 --> 02:19:22,830
How is this working?

2143
02:19:22,930 --> 02:19:23,930
You guys can land wherever?

2144
02:19:24,670 --> 02:19:28,970
No, it's still ALGS mode.

2145
02:19:29,590 --> 02:19:34,850
Yeah, so like, we all get random PIs, so whoever's next to us...

2146
02:19:35,730 --> 02:19:37,070
That's kind of...

2147
02:19:37,850 --> 02:19:38,210
Well...

2148
02:19:38,210 --> 02:19:41,110
Nobody in game has any idea where your team is landing.

2149
02:19:41,550 --> 02:19:43,310
No one knows where anyone is.

2150
02:19:43,370 --> 02:19:45,350
Yeah, we can pretend to be hiders too.

2151
02:19:45,470 --> 02:19:47,490
We can just walk up to them, see if they'll do anything.

2152
02:19:49,790 --> 02:19:52,990
Don't have your guns out and just run over to someone as if you're hiding.

2153
02:19:53,370 --> 02:19:55,690
Just pull out a gun and just load them up.

2154
02:19:55,810 --> 02:19:58,050
That's what I'm planning on doing.

2155
02:19:59,210 --> 02:20:00,190
Wait, wait, wait.

2156
02:20:00,190 --> 02:20:03,350
Yuris is asking, is crypto a role for hiders?

2157
02:20:04,630 --> 02:20:05,990
I think we said no for...

2158
02:20:05,990 --> 02:20:08,690
I feel like we should ban crypto for hiders.

2159
02:20:09,470 --> 02:20:11,870
Yeah, that's true.

2160
02:20:13,070 --> 02:20:13,750
Yeah, I don't know.

2161
02:20:13,870 --> 02:20:14,390
Should we?

2162
02:20:14,570 --> 02:20:15,490
Yeah, I feel like we should.

2163
02:20:16,190 --> 02:20:18,550
Dash, can you ban crypto for hiders?

2164
02:20:18,930 --> 02:20:20,510
I almost forgot about the invis thing.

2165
02:20:21,590 --> 02:20:23,050
I don't think you should lock crypto.

2166
02:20:24,050 --> 02:20:26,190
Alright, I'll see you guys in the next game.

2167
02:20:26,730 --> 02:20:27,330
Alright, good luck.

2168
02:20:27,330 --> 02:20:28,490
Alright, bye.

2169
02:20:30,510 --> 02:20:31,070
Alright.

2170
02:20:31,510 --> 02:20:32,610
Hey guys.

2171
02:20:33,090 --> 02:20:38,830
Alright, so let's have a little competition between Altera and I versus Jen.

2172
02:20:40,470 --> 02:20:41,430
And I feel like...

2173
02:20:41,430 --> 02:20:42,690
Where's the enemy highlight?

2174
02:20:42,830 --> 02:20:43,250
Oh, there it is.

2175
02:20:43,290 --> 02:20:43,750
I got it.

2176
02:20:44,130 --> 02:20:47,670
So, basically...

2177
02:20:47,670 --> 02:20:49,010
Wait, can we not?

2178
02:20:49,010 --> 02:20:49,890
We cannot play recon.

2179
02:20:50,090 --> 02:20:50,910
I call ballistic.

2180
02:20:51,430 --> 02:20:51,970
I call ballistic.

2181
02:20:52,610 --> 02:20:54,010
Ballistic, who the heck is that?

2182
02:20:54,870 --> 02:20:57,390
Ballistic, I have unlimited ammo so I don't wanna...

2183
02:20:58,390 --> 02:20:59,550
I got octane.

2184
02:20:59,810 --> 02:21:01,110
I dibs octane.

2185
02:21:01,610 --> 02:21:02,590
We're working together.

2186
02:21:02,750 --> 02:21:03,490
We're working together.

2187
02:21:05,070 --> 02:21:05,470
Pathfinder.

2188
02:21:05,950 --> 02:21:07,490
Oh, no, we can't play pathfinder.

2189
02:21:07,910 --> 02:21:08,650
We can't use pathfinder.

2190
02:21:09,070 --> 02:21:10,790
No, we can't.

2191
02:21:10,830 --> 02:21:11,130
Fuck.

2192
02:21:11,230 --> 02:21:12,050
Altera, what do we play?

2193
02:21:12,730 --> 02:21:14,250
Jen, okay, let's work together.

2194
02:21:14,510 --> 02:21:15,470
Jen, what should Altera...

2195
02:21:15,470 --> 02:21:16,610
No, no, no, no.

2196
02:21:19,370 --> 02:21:19,550
Jen, come on!

2197
02:21:21,470 --> 02:21:22,390
He's a baby!

2198
02:21:22,390 --> 02:21:22,990
He's a baby!

2199
02:21:23,570 --> 02:21:25,250
He's a fucking baby!

2200
02:21:25,970 --> 02:21:26,430
Jen, listen.

2201
02:21:27,770 --> 02:21:29,970
She turns her back on everyone, okay?

2202
02:21:30,110 --> 02:21:31,690
You and me, we can make out a deal.

2203
02:21:31,890 --> 02:21:33,550
Yeah, I'm down for that, Altera.

2204
02:21:33,990 --> 02:21:34,330
I'm down.

2205
02:21:35,890 --> 02:21:37,550
Oversight said crypto is okay.

2206
02:21:37,830 --> 02:21:38,290
Okay, I'm good.

2207
02:21:38,690 --> 02:21:39,850
Crypto not okay.

2208
02:21:42,230 --> 02:21:43,410
I overrule him.

2209
02:21:46,770 --> 02:21:47,630
Didn't he recon?

2210
02:21:48,570 --> 02:21:49,870
No, but he's saying hi.

2211
02:21:49,870 --> 02:21:49,890
Hi, there.

2212
02:21:57,470 --> 02:21:58,930
Altera, what are you going to do?

2213
02:21:59,350 --> 02:22:01,810
Wait, Altera, if you're second pick...

2214
02:22:01,810 --> 02:22:03,930
Wait, so we are banning crypto?

2215
02:22:04,030 --> 02:22:05,590
Yeah, we're banning crypto because he can go invisible.

2216
02:22:06,150 --> 02:22:08,710
And that would be a little fucked up for us.

2217
02:22:09,650 --> 02:22:13,510
Altera, if you get picked first, you should take octane from Jen.

2218
02:22:13,690 --> 02:22:14,070
No!

2219
02:22:14,070 --> 02:22:15,470
No, you should not do that!

2220
02:22:15,550 --> 02:22:16,570
Don't do that!

2221
02:22:17,950 --> 02:22:19,670
Alright, there's a big fight over here.

2222
02:22:21,690 --> 02:22:23,630
How much can either of you offer?

2223
02:22:24,650 --> 02:22:27,490
Altera, we're working together against Jen!

2224
02:22:28,030 --> 02:22:32,030
We're literally working together!

2225
02:22:34,950 --> 02:22:35,990
I need more than that.

2226
02:22:36,210 --> 02:22:40,050
Altera, if we win, we'll get something special.

2227
02:22:40,530 --> 02:22:42,290
I don't know what it is yet, but we'll get something.

2228
02:22:45,050 --> 02:22:45,850
That's crazy.

2229
02:22:46,030 --> 02:22:47,510
They're teaming up on me, guys.

2230
02:22:47,910 --> 02:22:50,070
If we win, I'll give you $500.

2231
02:22:52,550 --> 02:22:54,050
If it's a charity, and that's a deal.

2232
02:22:54,290 --> 02:22:55,730
Okay, yeah, 100%.

2233
02:22:55,730 --> 02:22:57,690
Jen, if you win, you get nothing.

2234
02:23:00,690 --> 02:23:09,810
You get the pleasure of winning against two VTubers.

2235
02:23:12,230 --> 02:23:12,950
That's insane.

2236
02:23:13,090 --> 02:23:14,010
Because I'm a pro player?

2237
02:23:14,170 --> 02:23:14,750
Nah, dude.

2238
02:23:16,210 --> 02:23:18,310
Don't you guys just love being competitive?

2239
02:23:18,750 --> 02:23:19,510
I'll tell you a secret, okay?

2240
02:23:19,670 --> 02:23:19,850
Listen.

2241
02:23:20,030 --> 02:23:23,370
I don't think I ever made it to plat, okay?

2242
02:23:24,330 --> 02:23:25,370
I thought you made it to...

2243
02:23:25,370 --> 02:23:26,410
You said you got to diamond!

2244
02:23:27,770 --> 02:23:29,250
You told us you're a diamond player!

2245
02:23:29,550 --> 02:23:29,810
It was plat.

2246
02:23:30,650 --> 02:23:31,630
You're a plat player?

2247
02:23:32,390 --> 02:23:33,950
I've never touched diamond in this game.

2248
02:23:36,350 --> 02:23:37,350
Wait, that's perfect.

2249
02:23:38,510 --> 02:23:39,210
Wait, what?

2250
02:23:39,370 --> 02:23:40,370
What do you mean, perfect?

2251
02:23:41,710 --> 02:23:43,110
What's that supposed to mean?

2252
02:23:43,310 --> 02:23:46,090
That's perfect, because then he has the perfect rank points.

2253
02:23:46,750 --> 02:23:47,870
Please give me first pick.

2254
02:23:49,590 --> 02:23:51,350
My god, please don't give him first pick.

2255
02:23:51,650 --> 02:23:52,590
Please don't give him.

2256
02:23:52,910 --> 02:23:53,350
No!

2257
02:23:55,310 --> 02:23:56,190
First pick!

2258
02:23:57,730 --> 02:23:59,010
Wait, where are you going to pick?

2259
02:23:59,290 --> 02:24:00,170
Where are you going to pick?

2260
02:24:00,250 --> 02:24:01,290
You have no more choices.

2261
02:24:02,930 --> 02:24:04,590
Oh, you TP'd to people.

2262
02:24:05,550 --> 02:24:07,150
TP to them, snare them.

2263
02:24:09,030 --> 02:24:10,550
And I get unlimited ammo.

2264
02:24:13,810 --> 02:24:15,650
Tempo told you guys to turn off enemy highlights, right?

2265
02:24:15,690 --> 02:24:16,690
Yeah, we got it off.

2266
02:24:18,350 --> 02:24:19,890
Can I just double check if I have that off?

2267
02:24:20,070 --> 02:24:20,430
Yeah, I do.

2268
02:24:21,510 --> 02:24:23,010
You guys ought to remind me to put it back on, though.

2269
02:24:23,030 --> 02:24:24,170
Imagine playing Scrim without it.

2270
02:24:24,530 --> 02:24:26,690
What if we don't?

2271
02:24:27,890 --> 02:24:30,150
He's going to Scrim without it.

2272
02:24:32,290 --> 02:24:33,790
Good luck, have fun, guys.

2273
02:24:34,070 --> 02:24:34,370
Yay!

2274
02:24:36,250 --> 02:24:37,370
It's kind of not that bad.

2275
02:24:37,930 --> 02:24:39,370
Wait, hiders can't shoot you, right?

2276
02:24:39,550 --> 02:24:40,070
No, they can't.

2277
02:24:40,070 --> 02:24:40,590
They can't do anything.

2278
02:24:40,690 --> 02:24:41,430
They just gotta hide.

2279
02:24:42,370 --> 02:24:42,610
Okay.

2280
02:24:44,270 --> 02:24:45,070
Fuck off, Doki.

2281
02:24:45,070 --> 02:24:45,690
These are my bins.

2282
02:24:45,870 --> 02:24:46,950
No, I'm fucking going there.

2283
02:24:47,050 --> 02:24:48,010
These are my bins.

2284
02:24:48,190 --> 02:24:49,030
No, no, no.

2285
02:24:49,190 --> 02:24:51,950
I get inside.

2286
02:24:53,350 --> 02:24:54,070
That's fine.

2287
02:24:55,190 --> 02:24:56,490
We have one gun.

2288
02:24:57,830 --> 02:24:58,550
It's self.

2289
02:25:00,670 --> 02:25:01,790
Keep doing it, Doki.

2290
02:25:02,610 --> 02:25:03,090
Keep doing it, Doki.

2291
02:25:03,090 --> 02:25:03,570
Sabotage.

2292
02:25:03,810 --> 02:25:06,730
I feel like we don't need to do one gun here, right?

2293
02:25:06,950 --> 02:25:08,130
I feel like...

2294
02:25:08,130 --> 02:25:10,110
as a hider...

2295
02:25:10,110 --> 02:25:11,150
I don't know.

2296
02:25:13,090 --> 02:25:14,550
Actually, maybe I'll do...

2297
02:25:16,570 --> 02:25:17,470
Okay, okay.

2298
02:25:17,570 --> 02:25:19,750
Jen and I will have one gun, but...

2299
02:25:19,750 --> 02:25:22,150
I have Altair on my team who can have two guns.

2300
02:25:22,570 --> 02:25:23,050
Woohoo!

2301
02:25:23,790 --> 02:25:24,270
Woo!

2302
02:25:29,870 --> 02:25:31,090
Wait, what?

2303
02:25:31,750 --> 02:25:31,990
What?

2304
02:25:33,270 --> 02:25:35,410
We found someone in the bag!

2305
02:25:36,070 --> 02:25:36,910
That's one in the bag!

2306
02:25:37,030 --> 02:25:38,470
I'm coming over.

2307
02:25:38,770 --> 02:25:41,850
Jen, you're fucking already killing people?

2308
02:25:43,270 --> 02:25:44,950
We haven't found anybody yet.

2309
02:25:45,110 --> 02:25:46,230
That's so fucked, Jen.

2310
02:25:46,830 --> 02:25:49,230
Let them play, Jen!

2311
02:25:49,990 --> 02:25:51,710
Come on, you're a pro.

2312
02:25:51,710 --> 02:25:52,610
Come on!

2313
02:25:52,770 --> 02:25:54,610
Would a pro really do this to us?

2314
02:25:54,710 --> 02:25:55,370
Just for fun.

2315
02:25:58,390 --> 02:25:59,630
Oh my god!

2316
02:25:59,730 --> 02:26:00,990
They're calling you out!

2317
02:26:01,610 --> 02:26:03,550
You wouldn't hate charity, right?

2318
02:26:03,770 --> 02:26:04,410
Yeah, yeah.

2319
02:26:04,550 --> 02:26:07,710
If you win, you basically are saying fuck charity.

2320
02:26:10,290 --> 02:26:11,210
How about...

2321
02:26:11,210 --> 02:26:12,970
I leave the last guy alive, you know?

2322
02:26:15,390 --> 02:26:15,850
Wow!

2323
02:26:16,630 --> 02:26:17,950
What an honor!

2324
02:26:17,950 --> 02:26:19,950
The last guy!

2325
02:26:21,130 --> 02:26:21,570
Wow!

2326
02:26:22,010 --> 02:26:22,990
You shouldn't have.

2327
02:26:23,550 --> 02:26:26,130
Okay, Altair, I'm running on the other side of the map.

2328
02:26:26,210 --> 02:26:26,990
I'm running on the other side.

2329
02:26:27,310 --> 02:26:29,270
I'll see you on the other side.

2330
02:26:29,850 --> 02:26:30,490
I'm gonna go here.

2331
02:26:31,470 --> 02:26:32,550
I can't believe it.

2332
02:26:33,830 --> 02:26:34,930
I need a car.

2333
02:26:35,530 --> 02:26:37,550
Oh my god, you don't get cars here.

2334
02:26:37,750 --> 02:26:40,370
There's no cars in fucking...

2335
02:26:40,370 --> 02:26:41,430
Why aren't you admiring this?

2336
02:26:41,450 --> 02:26:42,850
There's no cars in Broken Moon!

2337
02:26:43,290 --> 02:26:43,870
Give me a car!

2338
02:26:43,870 --> 02:26:44,050
Give me a car!

2339
02:26:45,430 --> 02:26:46,670
Oh my god.

2340
02:26:47,090 --> 02:26:48,690
Where the fuck could they be hiding?

2341
02:26:50,490 --> 02:26:52,530
Jen is already hunting people down.

2342
02:26:52,710 --> 02:26:53,570
He's already hunting.

2343
02:26:53,670 --> 02:26:54,190
I'm already.

2344
02:26:55,250 --> 02:26:56,690
I think there's someone up here.

2345
02:26:56,690 --> 02:26:57,410
I smell them.

2346
02:26:57,530 --> 02:26:58,710
They smell like dog shit up here.

2347
02:26:59,150 --> 02:27:01,750
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running!

2348
02:27:02,050 --> 02:27:02,950
I'm zip gliding!

2349
02:27:03,770 --> 02:27:05,110
Altair, we have zero kills!

2350
02:27:05,210 --> 02:27:05,990
Why were you trying?

2351
02:27:06,930 --> 02:27:08,070
There's gotta be someone here.

2352
02:27:08,330 --> 02:27:09,470
I see someone.

2353
02:27:09,470 --> 02:27:09,870
Come on.

2354
02:27:10,290 --> 02:27:12,130
I see someone shoot them.

2355
02:27:14,640 --> 02:27:15,620
What are you doing?

2356
02:27:16,680 --> 02:27:18,540
Wait, Altair, you're doing it.

2357
02:27:19,300 --> 02:27:20,920
They're running away, they're running away.

2358
02:27:21,180 --> 02:27:22,160
They're running away?

2359
02:27:22,280 --> 02:27:22,900
That's illegal.

2360
02:27:23,420 --> 02:27:24,420
It's not though.

2361
02:27:24,600 --> 02:27:26,760
It's not, they can't run.

2362
02:27:28,900 --> 02:27:30,120
Oh my god.

2363
02:27:34,540 --> 02:27:35,160
Aha!

2364
02:27:35,920 --> 02:27:36,840
They're running!

2365
02:27:36,840 --> 02:27:37,340
Aha!

2366
02:27:42,600 --> 02:27:43,480
Come here, bitch.

2367
02:27:44,300 --> 02:27:45,260
Come here, bitch.

2368
02:27:46,420 --> 02:27:47,420
Come here, bitch.

2369
02:27:47,620 --> 02:27:48,140
Come here, bitch.

2370
02:27:53,540 --> 02:27:55,460
I'm chasing this motherfucker down.

2371
02:27:56,360 --> 02:27:57,460
Oh my god, that poor guy.

2372
02:27:57,800 --> 02:27:58,540
Somebody kill him.

2373
02:27:58,780 --> 02:28:01,860
Somebody accidentally punch him.

2374
02:28:01,940 --> 02:28:02,800
It would be such a shame.

2375
02:28:03,400 --> 02:28:04,500
It would be such a shame.

2376
02:28:05,960 --> 02:28:06,860
Leave him for dead.

2377
02:28:08,620 --> 02:28:11,440
It would be such a shame if somebody just punches him.

2378
02:28:12,380 --> 02:28:14,780
Oh my god, it would be so funny though.

2379
02:28:15,120 --> 02:28:16,320
Aha, bitch!

2380
02:28:17,320 --> 02:28:18,520
How am I supposed to find anybody?

2381
02:28:19,020 --> 02:28:20,500
They're such good hiders.

2382
02:28:22,140 --> 02:28:23,760
That's a Mirage decoy, there's no way.

2383
02:28:23,940 --> 02:28:26,540
That is crazy.

2384
02:28:26,960 --> 02:28:29,340
Got one kill, it's still one kill.

2385
02:28:31,040 --> 02:28:31,600
Hello.

2386
02:28:32,680 --> 02:28:34,220
Who is this?

2387
02:28:34,220 --> 02:28:36,040
Where's this purple shield at?

2388
02:28:36,560 --> 02:28:37,600
I smell them.

2389
02:28:38,120 --> 02:28:40,640
Whistler duration in the world is tripled?

2390
02:28:41,620 --> 02:28:42,920
Oh my god, what do I get, chat?

2391
02:28:43,100 --> 02:28:44,220
Slingshot or...

2392
02:28:45,360 --> 02:28:47,060
Oh my god, where are they hiding?

2393
02:28:47,220 --> 02:28:48,360
I see them!

2394
02:28:48,760 --> 02:28:49,560
Wait, is that...

2395
02:28:50,260 --> 02:28:52,060
Is that part of the...

2396
02:28:53,800 --> 02:28:55,400
Wait, is that part of the world?

2397
02:28:56,120 --> 02:28:57,000
Ah, decoys.

2398
02:28:58,260 --> 02:28:59,300
There's so much...

2399
02:28:59,300 --> 02:29:01,580
I wish we landed on separate sides of the map.

2400
02:29:01,580 --> 02:29:03,200
Because everyone's gonna go away from us.

2401
02:29:03,320 --> 02:29:04,780
Yeah, but they don't know where...

2402
02:29:04,780 --> 02:29:05,720
Yeah, they do.

2403
02:29:06,960 --> 02:29:08,400
Where we came from, yeah.

2404
02:29:09,440 --> 02:29:09,820
Oh no.

2405
02:29:10,840 --> 02:29:12,500
So everyone knows we're coming from Breaking Wolf.

2406
02:29:12,960 --> 02:29:15,220
Yeah, but if we keep running, they won't know.

2407
02:29:16,040 --> 02:29:16,340
True.

2408
02:29:16,480 --> 02:29:17,800
I'm literally on the other side now.

2409
02:29:18,680 --> 02:29:20,020
I'm trying to find this Pathfinder, dude.

2410
02:29:20,720 --> 02:29:23,040
There's a fucking Mirage clone here?

2411
02:29:24,540 --> 02:29:24,960
Oh my god, dude.

2412
02:29:24,960 --> 02:29:26,520
I'm just gonna go the other side, I know where everyone is.

2413
02:29:26,720 --> 02:29:27,980
I definitely know where everyone is.

2414
02:29:27,980 --> 02:29:28,880
Okay, I'm following you.

2415
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:30,240
No, don't follow me.

2416
02:29:31,600 --> 02:29:32,580
I'm following you.

2417
02:29:33,100 --> 02:29:34,100
These are all my kills.

2418
02:29:35,820 --> 02:29:37,140
Oh my god, I haven't found a single...

2419
02:29:37,140 --> 02:29:38,760
These guys are such good hiders!

2420
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:43,320
What if we shot Jem?

2421
02:29:44,760 --> 02:29:45,920
Why don't we like...

2422
02:29:45,920 --> 02:29:47,600
Why don't we push him off the cliff?

2423
02:29:49,860 --> 02:29:51,300
Let's do it, let's kidnap him with a car.

2424
02:29:51,980 --> 02:29:53,320
Wait, there's no cars!

2425
02:29:53,480 --> 02:29:56,500
There's no cars, we can't push him out.

2426
02:29:57,320 --> 02:29:59,540
We'll do what we did to Axel.

2427
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:04,160
Where he got stuck and couldn't...

2428
02:30:04,160 --> 02:30:04,980
I'll play Pathfinder.

2429
02:30:05,780 --> 02:30:07,640
Oh, I see someone flying.

2430
02:30:07,920 --> 02:30:09,660
There has to be somebody on this side, right?

2431
02:30:09,800 --> 02:30:10,960
I see someone flying too!

2432
02:30:12,080 --> 02:30:12,980
I'm getting involved!

2433
02:30:13,220 --> 02:30:14,320
I saw him first!

2434
02:30:16,080 --> 02:30:17,120
Altair, you can TP!

2435
02:30:19,540 --> 02:30:21,940
I'm gonna TP for another 10 seconds.

2436
02:30:22,460 --> 02:30:22,700
No.

2437
02:30:23,460 --> 02:30:23,940
No!

2438
02:30:27,320 --> 02:30:29,340
Why is there no one hiding in this corner?

2439
02:30:32,720 --> 02:30:33,520
Who's next?

2440
02:30:33,720 --> 02:30:35,900
Oh my god, they know you're an Octane too.

2441
02:30:36,040 --> 02:30:36,680
They know.

2442
02:30:37,300 --> 02:30:38,160
Wait, Zan can kill me.

2443
02:30:38,220 --> 02:30:38,980
Hold up, one sec.

2444
02:30:39,500 --> 02:30:39,840
Let me heal.

2445
02:30:41,140 --> 02:30:41,940
Don't let him heal!

2446
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:44,320
Melee him into zone!

2447
02:30:45,360 --> 02:30:48,200
Altair, go over there and melee him into zone.

2448
02:30:48,200 --> 02:30:48,240
Oh my god.

2449
02:30:52,060 --> 02:30:53,020
Wait, he's on.

2450
02:30:53,780 --> 02:30:54,580
No, you don't.

2451
02:30:54,680 --> 02:30:54,900
No, you don't.

2452
02:30:54,960 --> 02:30:57,740
What are you talking about?

2453
02:30:59,120 --> 02:30:59,920
Oh my god.

2454
02:31:00,260 --> 02:31:01,640
Altair, you even saw somebody!

2455
02:31:01,820 --> 02:31:03,580
I haven't seen a single person!

2456
02:31:05,380 --> 02:31:05,960
What?!

2457
02:31:12,180 --> 02:31:14,880
I haven't seen a single man!

2458
02:31:15,420 --> 02:31:16,300
Or woman!

2459
02:31:18,720 --> 02:31:19,500
There you go.

2460
02:31:21,960 --> 02:31:22,880
I'm scared.

2461
02:31:24,400 --> 02:31:25,420
Oh my god.

2462
02:31:27,340 --> 02:31:30,260
Doki, there's someone coming over towards your far.

2463
02:31:30,380 --> 02:31:30,660
Do you mind?

2464
02:31:30,840 --> 02:31:32,300
No, I am way too far.

2465
02:31:34,540 --> 02:31:34,800
Wait.

2466
02:31:36,720 --> 02:31:37,580
Wait a minute.

2467
02:31:39,820 --> 02:31:41,280
I'm gonna follow this guy.

2468
02:31:41,340 --> 02:31:42,200
I'm gonna see if I can trick him.

2469
02:31:44,040 --> 02:31:44,500
Doki!

2470
02:31:44,660 --> 02:31:44,960
Run!

2471
02:31:44,960 --> 02:31:45,980
I can't find any link!

2472
02:31:46,320 --> 02:31:48,560
This is the first time I found a guy!

2473
02:31:49,020 --> 02:31:50,140
I got leaked!

2474
02:31:50,200 --> 02:31:51,280
I killed another one!

2475
02:31:51,680 --> 02:31:53,220
I'm finishing him!

2476
02:31:53,680 --> 02:31:54,900
Stay shank him!

2477
02:31:55,600 --> 02:31:58,900
This is the first time I found a person!

2478
02:31:59,880 --> 02:32:03,160
I can't believe they leaked my location!

2479
02:32:04,600 --> 02:32:05,680
So fucked!

2480
02:32:06,080 --> 02:32:09,220
I literally couldn't find anybody and he leaked it.

2481
02:32:09,560 --> 02:32:12,780
Just when I saw one guy running towards me.

2482
02:32:14,960 --> 02:32:15,960
That's so fucked.

2483
02:32:16,100 --> 02:32:17,500
That's actually so fucked.

2484
02:32:18,020 --> 02:32:20,200
He doxed me, I can't believe it.

2485
02:32:20,820 --> 02:32:22,960
I can't believe I got doxed.

2486
02:32:26,080 --> 02:32:27,780
In this ring, come in faster.

2487
02:32:29,220 --> 02:32:30,680
I have four kills, what about you guys?

2488
02:32:30,940 --> 02:32:32,500
Shut the fuck up!

2489
02:32:34,300 --> 02:32:35,940
Shut the fuck up.

2490
02:32:37,640 --> 02:32:40,580
I got doxed, what do you want me to do?

2491
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:42,100
I got doxed too!

2492
02:32:42,100 --> 02:32:42,160
I got doxed too!

2493
02:32:43,640 --> 02:32:45,080
The one guy!

2494
02:32:45,300 --> 02:32:46,100
I got one!

2495
02:32:48,480 --> 02:32:50,100
I'm gonna steal that kill.

2496
02:32:56,460 --> 02:32:59,180
So Jen, that partnership...

2497
02:32:59,180 --> 02:32:59,980
Wait, wait, wait.

2498
02:33:00,900 --> 02:33:03,420
You can't just ditch me like this.

2499
02:33:04,020 --> 02:33:05,540
I go in the path of the winners.

2500
02:33:06,280 --> 02:33:07,540
Oh, I'll tear, I'll tear.

2501
02:33:07,800 --> 02:33:09,400
So you hate charity too.

2502
02:33:10,300 --> 02:33:12,860
So what you're saying is...

2503
02:33:12,860 --> 02:33:14,120
I love charity.

2504
02:33:14,320 --> 02:33:16,240
I love charity.

2505
02:33:16,400 --> 02:33:18,860
Oh my god, you guys fucking suck.

2506
02:33:19,920 --> 02:33:22,220
I can't find a single...

2507
02:33:22,220 --> 02:33:25,120
I'm literally looking at someone.

2508
02:33:25,340 --> 02:33:26,800
Someone just rezzed.

2509
02:33:27,020 --> 02:33:27,620
I'm farming.

2510
02:33:29,560 --> 02:33:30,660
That doesn't count.

2511
02:33:30,740 --> 02:33:32,020
That doesn't add to your count.

2512
02:33:32,500 --> 02:33:33,300
It does, it does.

2513
02:33:33,400 --> 02:33:35,060
No it doesn't if you killed him already.

2514
02:33:35,120 --> 02:33:36,060
The guy that I just killed!

2515
02:33:36,540 --> 02:33:38,860
I got one, I got one, I got one.

2516
02:33:38,860 --> 02:33:39,000
What do you mean?

2517
02:33:39,860 --> 02:33:41,360
What do you mean you got one?

2518
02:33:44,660 --> 02:33:46,440
Are we still on the same team?

2519
02:33:46,720 --> 02:33:48,960
Yes, yes, yes.

2520
02:33:49,160 --> 02:33:49,960
That's good, that's good.

2521
02:33:49,980 --> 02:33:50,800
I'm happy now.

2522
02:33:50,980 --> 02:33:51,480
For now.

2523
02:33:55,120 --> 02:33:56,220
Oh my god.

2524
02:33:56,280 --> 02:33:57,200
This is bullshit.

2525
02:33:57,660 --> 02:34:00,300
This is actually bullshit.

2526
02:34:00,580 --> 02:34:02,280
I can't find anybody.

2527
02:34:02,800 --> 02:34:03,640
You don't have a kill yet?

2528
02:34:04,980 --> 02:34:06,360
What's going on?

2529
02:34:06,360 --> 02:34:07,200
There's no one here!

2530
02:34:07,440 --> 02:34:09,580
That is crazy right now.

2531
02:34:09,580 --> 02:34:13,380
I saw one guy and then I got doxxed and then he disappeared.

2532
02:34:13,820 --> 02:34:15,480
And then he fucking disappeared.

2533
02:34:16,140 --> 02:34:18,560
He literally doxxed me at the worst timing.

2534
02:34:19,260 --> 02:34:21,620
The worst time to ever doxx somebody.

2535
02:34:23,400 --> 02:34:25,280
We gotta kill people man.

2536
02:34:25,640 --> 02:34:26,180
Where?

2537
02:34:26,420 --> 02:34:26,820
Where?

2538
02:34:26,820 --> 02:34:28,180
We haven't killed one squad yet.

2539
02:34:29,400 --> 02:34:30,040
Where?

2540
02:34:30,600 --> 02:34:32,140
Where do I do this?

2541
02:34:34,200 --> 02:34:35,500
I need shotgun ammo.

2542
02:34:35,580 --> 02:34:36,200
I'm gonna run out.

2543
02:34:36,500 --> 02:34:39,120
For real.

2544
02:34:39,460 --> 02:34:40,920
Oh my god.

2545
02:34:40,960 --> 02:34:41,540
Shotgun ammo.

2546
02:34:44,900 --> 02:34:46,160
That's a Mirage clone.

2547
02:34:46,860 --> 02:34:47,880
There's someone ratting in here.

2548
02:34:48,040 --> 02:34:48,560
I smell him.

2549
02:34:49,680 --> 02:34:50,960
The door's closed.

2550
02:34:54,960 --> 02:34:56,300
You killed one!

2551
02:34:56,480 --> 02:34:57,600
You got your first kill!

2552
02:34:58,120 --> 02:34:58,880
Let's go!

2553
02:34:58,880 --> 02:35:00,500
I did it!

2554
02:35:00,700 --> 02:35:02,920
You did it!

2555
02:35:06,700 --> 02:35:08,380
I don't have heals.

2556
02:35:08,440 --> 02:35:08,900
I don't need heals.

2557
02:35:08,960 --> 02:35:09,440
I just need ammo.

2558
02:35:09,700 --> 02:35:10,800
This is just the beginning.

2559
02:35:16,400 --> 02:35:17,520
We did it!

2560
02:35:17,840 --> 02:35:20,520
We got our one kill.

2561
02:35:21,500 --> 02:35:22,600
I got my one kill.

2562
02:35:22,960 --> 02:35:23,980
Okay, we have two guys.

2563
02:35:23,980 --> 02:35:26,060
How long must I tolerate amateurs?

2564
02:35:26,460 --> 02:35:28,040
It's an update.

2565
02:35:28,260 --> 02:35:31,080
You're getting all the leaks right now.

2566
02:35:32,140 --> 02:35:34,200
The IRS is coming.

2567
02:35:37,040 --> 02:35:38,720
I pumped him.

2568
02:35:38,720 --> 02:35:39,480
Is this RPR?

2569
02:35:39,860 --> 02:35:41,000
I pumped him bad.

2570
02:35:45,500 --> 02:35:46,840
Oh my god.

2571
02:35:47,900 --> 02:35:49,280
Oh, there's no more resists.

2572
02:35:49,600 --> 02:35:51,320
We can't res people anymore.

2573
02:35:51,320 --> 02:35:53,020
They're dead dead.

2574
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:58,160
Red shield.

2575
02:36:01,010 --> 02:36:01,660
Ain't no way.

2576
02:36:02,920 --> 02:36:04,060
Oh my god.

2577
02:36:04,740 --> 02:36:06,240
Wait, Jen, are you using two guns?

2578
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:07,200
Yeah.

2579
02:36:08,120 --> 02:36:09,620
Someone sees one gun!

2580
02:36:10,460 --> 02:36:11,720
Who said that?

2581
02:36:13,280 --> 02:36:14,440
Automatic disqualification.

2582
02:36:14,700 --> 02:36:15,080
We win!

2583
02:36:18,180 --> 02:36:20,900
This guy has a grapple cooldown of like 10 seconds.

2584
02:36:20,900 --> 02:36:23,160
Bro, every match you cheat!

2585
02:36:30,180 --> 02:36:32,900
Do I smell an on-the-fly punishment?

2586
02:36:34,720 --> 02:36:36,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2587
02:36:36,700 --> 02:36:38,620
What is it?

2588
02:36:38,940 --> 02:36:40,560
Do I have to play Southpaw or what?

2589
02:36:42,500 --> 02:36:44,360
Yeah, yeah, on-the-fly punishment.

2590
02:36:44,500 --> 02:36:45,120
What is it?

2591
02:36:46,020 --> 02:36:47,240
Alright, 70 FOV.

2592
02:36:50,900 --> 02:36:51,580
Max brightness.

2593
02:36:52,480 --> 02:36:53,100
What?

2594
02:36:54,420 --> 02:36:55,660
Max brightness?

2595
02:36:56,740 --> 02:36:58,740
Bro, what the fuck is this?

2596
02:37:03,720 --> 02:37:06,980
I'm a magnifying glass right now.

2597
02:37:07,100 --> 02:37:07,540
Right here.

2598
02:37:08,500 --> 02:37:09,980
I can definitely see them.

2599
02:37:11,600 --> 02:37:13,780
I'm playing a whole different game right now.

2600
02:37:14,160 --> 02:37:14,780
My eyes!

2601
02:37:14,960 --> 02:37:15,720
Oh my god.

2602
02:37:21,040 --> 02:37:21,720
Wait, where are they at?

2603
02:37:22,940 --> 02:37:24,500
Oh my god, I'm going to zoom into their soul.

2604
02:37:24,920 --> 02:37:27,620
You're going to zoom into their soul?

2605
02:37:27,800 --> 02:37:29,200
Is that even...

2606
02:37:29,200 --> 02:37:29,920
Boom!

2607
02:37:31,720 --> 02:37:31,880
Boom!

2608
02:37:37,520 --> 02:37:39,460
How do I not see a single person?

2609
02:37:42,260 --> 02:37:42,680
Hello?

2610
02:37:47,960 --> 02:37:48,380
Yeah!

2611
02:37:50,700 --> 02:37:50,880
Thank you!

2612
02:37:51,900 --> 02:37:52,780
Oh no!

2613
02:37:54,260 --> 02:37:55,140
I'm sorry!

2614
02:37:57,040 --> 02:37:57,580
I'm sorry!

2615
02:37:57,700 --> 02:37:59,980
This is the FOV I used to play on console, bro.

2616
02:38:00,100 --> 02:38:00,920
What is this shit?

2617
02:38:01,240 --> 02:38:02,280
I'm so sorry!

2618
02:38:03,220 --> 02:38:04,400
2004, bro.

2619
02:38:05,480 --> 02:38:07,460
I'm sorry, I didn't know that

2620
02:38:10,940 --> 02:38:11,800
was...

2621
02:38:11,800 --> 02:38:12,700
I found so many of them.

2622
02:38:13,160 --> 02:38:14,300
Wait, I'm at four kills.

2623
02:38:15,100 --> 02:38:16,480
Where are you at?

2624
02:38:16,860 --> 02:38:18,760
I found a lot of them, though.

2625
02:38:18,760 --> 02:38:20,540
My sense feels so weird.

2626
02:38:21,200 --> 02:38:22,940
If I knew, I would have let her live!

2627
02:38:23,580 --> 02:38:25,240
I would have let her live!

2628
02:38:25,340 --> 02:38:25,720
I'm sorry!

2629
02:38:25,720 --> 02:38:27,520
I'm getting nauseous, I ain't going to lie.

2630
02:38:30,560 --> 02:38:32,480
Kreek, you got to help him!

2631
02:38:32,540 --> 02:38:33,860
He's getting nauseous!

2632
02:38:34,600 --> 02:38:36,080
I'm getting a bit sick, lad.

2633
02:38:36,840 --> 02:38:37,260
It's fine.

2634
02:38:38,100 --> 02:38:38,980
80 FOV.

2635
02:38:40,060 --> 02:38:40,720
That's you?

2636
02:38:41,120 --> 02:38:42,840
What's up, dude?

2637
02:38:42,940 --> 02:38:43,240
How you doing?

2638
02:38:44,960 --> 02:38:45,680
Oh my god.

2639
02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:46,660
I'm five, I'm five.

2640
02:38:46,720 --> 02:38:47,820
How many do you have?

2641
02:38:49,920 --> 02:38:52,040
It's on my 30th right now.

2642
02:38:52,120 --> 02:38:52,400
What about you?

2643
02:38:52,480 --> 02:38:53,340
There's no way.

2644
02:38:53,580 --> 02:38:54,440
There's no way.

2645
02:39:02,640 --> 02:39:03,620
Oh my god.

2646
02:39:03,700 --> 02:39:06,600
There has to be somebody out there.

2647
02:39:06,860 --> 02:39:07,780
No way I missed that.

2648
02:39:11,380 --> 02:39:12,940
Well, we'll see if you get the kill.

2649
02:39:20,390 --> 02:39:21,290
You're shooting me right now?

2650
02:39:21,290 --> 02:39:21,890
That's crazy.

2651
02:39:26,070 --> 02:39:27,650
What am I playing?

2652
02:39:28,370 --> 02:39:30,750
Dude, I'm going back to PlayStation 1, man.

2653
02:39:30,850 --> 02:39:32,010
Fucking shit, dude.

2654
02:39:34,030 --> 02:39:34,750
Help me!

2655
02:39:35,310 --> 02:39:36,010
Help me!

2656
02:39:36,690 --> 02:39:37,530
That's my kill!

2657
02:39:37,650 --> 02:39:38,050
That's mine!

2658
02:39:38,070 --> 02:39:40,970
No way!

2659
02:39:43,010 --> 02:39:44,490
No fucking way!

2660
02:39:44,490 --> 02:39:45,010
No fucking way!

2661
02:39:45,010 --> 02:39:50,790
There's no fucking way.

2662
02:39:50,930 --> 02:39:52,370
Why are we all here together?

2663
02:39:52,550 --> 02:39:53,170
Get out!

2664
02:39:53,750 --> 02:39:55,210
Get out of here!

2665
02:39:58,630 --> 02:39:59,470
Steal the kill!

2666
02:39:59,610 --> 02:40:01,330
What are you doing?

2667
02:40:01,790 --> 02:40:03,650
I can't climb, for fuck's sake.

2668
02:40:07,390 --> 02:40:08,530
Badass Loba down.

2669
02:40:08,710 --> 02:40:09,250
I'm finishing him.

2670
02:40:15,940 --> 02:40:16,680
No way.

2671
02:40:16,680 --> 02:40:18,560
There's no way he does that.

2672
02:40:23,340 --> 02:40:24,620
Wait, I forgot.

2673
02:40:24,840 --> 02:40:25,560
I'm allowed to use nades.

2674
02:40:25,640 --> 02:40:27,700
I know it's my custom, but I forgot my own rules.

2675
02:40:28,140 --> 02:40:30,020
I actually don't know if you're allowed to use nades.

2676
02:40:30,300 --> 02:40:31,520
I don't remember.

2677
02:40:31,980 --> 02:40:34,820
I don't remember also.

2678
02:40:40,840 --> 02:40:42,500
We have to look up.

2679
02:40:42,500 --> 02:40:43,380
Look up!

2680
02:40:43,480 --> 02:40:44,720
There's people up top!

2681
02:40:44,920 --> 02:40:45,660
What's up, cuz?

2682
02:40:47,360 --> 02:40:48,280
A lot of people over here.

2683
02:40:48,360 --> 02:40:48,920
There's people!

2684
02:40:49,180 --> 02:40:49,700
Look up!

2685
02:41:05,940 --> 02:41:06,480
Nice!

2686
02:41:07,800 --> 02:41:08,340
No!

2687
02:41:13,260 --> 02:41:15,820
There's no way this guy got rezzed.

2688
02:41:15,940 --> 02:41:17,060
This is Timmy!

2689
02:41:17,460 --> 02:41:18,420
I'm chasing Timmy down.

2690
02:41:18,640 --> 02:41:19,780
I see Timmy!

2691
02:41:23,920 --> 02:41:24,880
It's my teammate!

2692
02:41:24,880 --> 02:41:25,540
It's my teammate!

2693
02:41:25,720 --> 02:41:26,380
I'm finishing him!

2694
02:41:27,520 --> 02:41:28,620
You know it's him!

2695
02:41:28,960 --> 02:41:29,920
I know it's him.

2696
02:41:33,600 --> 02:41:34,660
Oh my god.

2697
02:41:36,960 --> 02:41:38,100
I'm running out of ammo.

2698
02:41:39,740 --> 02:41:40,540
Come near me!

2699
02:41:40,600 --> 02:41:41,620
I have ult.

2700
02:41:43,740 --> 02:41:45,240
There's a lot of them here.

2701
02:41:49,380 --> 02:41:50,240
It's time.

2702
02:41:52,820 --> 02:41:53,740
Oh my god.

2703
02:41:53,740 --> 02:41:54,280
I'm gonna die to zone!

2704
02:41:57,220 --> 02:41:58,960
They're all so low!

2705
02:42:00,260 --> 02:42:01,340
I can't climb!

2706
02:42:02,160 --> 02:42:02,780
Oh no!

2707
02:42:11,120 --> 02:42:12,960
Oh my god.

2708
02:42:13,960 --> 02:42:16,040
I'm gonna take this out.

2709
02:42:16,660 --> 02:42:19,720
They're all parkouring!

2710
02:42:20,260 --> 02:42:20,860
Guys!

2711
02:42:21,840 --> 02:42:23,000
They're all parkouring!

2712
02:42:23,620 --> 02:42:25,380
What do we do when they start parkouring?

2713
02:42:28,050 --> 02:42:28,850
Oh my god!

2714
02:42:28,890 --> 02:42:30,230
There's ults too?

2715
02:42:31,770 --> 02:42:32,350
Oh no.

2716
02:42:37,300 --> 02:42:39,020
What the fuck is this?

2717
02:42:42,180 --> 02:42:43,460
This is...

2718
02:42:43,460 --> 02:42:44,880
What am I looking at?

2719
02:42:46,420 --> 02:42:46,720
What?

2720
02:42:47,400 --> 02:42:50,900
What am I looking at?

2721
02:42:51,480 --> 02:42:53,140
You're like one of the rats.

2722
02:42:53,140 --> 02:42:55,060
There's ants in there!

2723
02:42:55,160 --> 02:42:56,840
There are literally ants in there!

2724
02:42:57,040 --> 02:42:57,960
I can't!

2725
02:42:58,880 --> 02:43:00,160
I can't!

2726
02:43:00,360 --> 02:43:01,620
I'm fucking dying!

2727
02:43:03,200 --> 02:43:04,320
I'm fucking dying!

2728
02:43:04,660 --> 02:43:05,520
I can't!

2729
02:43:05,600 --> 02:43:08,880
I need to save my ammo!

2730
02:43:09,160 --> 02:43:11,220
It's a fucking beehive!

2731
02:43:11,240 --> 02:43:12,260
There's a beehive here!

2732
02:43:12,980 --> 02:43:14,160
It's crazy!

2733
02:43:15,020 --> 02:43:16,760
It's an actual beehive.

2734
02:43:17,040 --> 02:43:18,280
Oh my god.

2735
02:43:18,340 --> 02:43:18,800
I can't.

2736
02:43:23,080 --> 02:43:24,180
They're just hiding!

2737
02:43:24,640 --> 02:43:26,160
How the fuck do I get up there?

2738
02:43:30,110 --> 02:43:31,620
I lifted the beehive!

2739
02:43:32,040 --> 02:43:33,260
Oh my god.

2740
02:43:33,640 --> 02:43:35,680
How do I get up there?

2741
02:43:41,150 --> 02:43:42,450
Are you serious?

2742
02:43:44,110 --> 02:43:45,590
Wait, I think they don't know.

2743
02:43:46,650 --> 02:43:47,650
They don't know I'm partying.

2744
02:43:48,150 --> 02:43:49,250
It's disabled!

2745
02:43:49,990 --> 02:43:50,390
What?

2746
02:43:52,070 --> 02:43:53,610
I'm disabled right now.

2747
02:44:00,360 --> 02:44:03,920
Wait, what's going on over there?

2748
02:44:06,550 --> 02:44:07,850
I'm so confused.

2749
02:44:08,190 --> 02:44:08,690
Wait, no!

2750
02:44:09,810 --> 02:44:10,930
Didn't got him.

2751
02:44:11,850 --> 02:44:12,530
Oh my god.

2752
02:44:12,650 --> 02:44:13,950
They're all rezzing.

2753
02:44:17,170 --> 02:44:19,150
Oh my god.

2754
02:44:19,630 --> 02:44:20,690
There's too many.

2755
02:44:26,020 --> 02:44:26,580
Bro!

2756
02:44:26,880 --> 02:44:27,560
They're at the balloon!

2757
02:44:30,480 --> 02:44:32,600
This Valkyrie is hurting my wrists.

2758
02:44:32,600 --> 02:44:35,460
What the fuck?

2759
02:44:35,700 --> 02:44:35,980
I can't!

2760
02:44:36,560 --> 02:44:38,920
My boobie can't handle this no longer!

2761
02:44:40,020 --> 02:44:41,180
I can't do it!

2762
02:44:42,180 --> 02:44:43,400
Okay, we got another one.

2763
02:44:46,200 --> 02:44:47,040
There we go.

2764
02:44:47,340 --> 02:44:48,220
I got one.

2765
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:49,600
I got another.

2766
02:44:56,940 --> 02:44:58,060
This guy is insane.

2767
02:45:00,320 --> 02:45:01,900
I can't get this guy!

2768
02:45:03,660 --> 02:45:04,440
Fuck me!

2769
02:45:05,500 --> 02:45:06,520
Oh my god.

2770
02:45:06,520 --> 02:45:08,060
Dude, I got a kill!

2771
02:45:11,220 --> 02:45:13,400
This is not fair!

2772
02:45:15,560 --> 02:45:16,720
Oh my god.

2773
02:45:16,800 --> 02:45:17,760
One team was left.

2774
02:45:18,160 --> 02:45:19,320
We did it!

2775
02:45:21,190 --> 02:45:23,150
I don't know.

2776
02:45:23,690 --> 02:45:24,750
There's so many.

2777
02:45:25,030 --> 02:45:26,870
I didn't even check how many kills I got.

2778
02:45:27,090 --> 02:45:28,330
Guys, how many kills I got?

2779
02:45:29,310 --> 02:45:31,230
Holy fuck, I don't know how many kills I had.

2780
02:45:31,690 --> 02:45:33,350
I couldn't tell!

2781
02:45:33,710 --> 02:45:34,970
I couldn't tell!

2782
02:45:34,970 --> 02:45:35,810
We were...

2783
02:45:35,810 --> 02:45:38,610
We had non-stop unlimited ammo.

2784
02:45:38,770 --> 02:45:40,610
Because we kept killing people.

2785
02:45:41,050 --> 02:45:43,210
But we never needed ammo.

2786
02:45:46,990 --> 02:45:48,270
I think I had like 50.

2787
02:45:48,710 --> 02:45:50,050
Oh my god.

2788
02:45:51,390 --> 02:45:52,350
Oh, that's going on YouTube?

2789
02:45:52,830 --> 02:45:53,510
Holy...

2790
02:45:53,510 --> 02:45:55,630
They're like little roaches.

2791
02:45:56,110 --> 02:45:58,370
When they scat, they see us.

2792
02:46:00,230 --> 02:46:00,850
73?

2793
02:46:03,510 --> 02:46:05,230
Oh my god.

2794
02:46:05,570 --> 02:46:07,150
I don't know how many kills I got.

2795
02:46:12,550 --> 02:46:13,590
We got...

2796
02:46:13,590 --> 02:46:14,470
Gooner Gang.

2797
02:46:14,730 --> 02:46:16,470
Gooner Gang got second place.

2798
02:46:16,670 --> 02:46:17,610
Oh, go for them.

2799
02:46:18,990 --> 02:46:21,810
Yeah, this is Tappi's team.

2800
02:46:22,250 --> 02:46:22,570
I think.

2801
02:46:23,410 --> 02:46:24,190
Is it Tappi's team?

2802
02:46:28,610 --> 02:46:30,510
What has Greek done to me?

2803
02:46:30,510 --> 02:46:31,490
Oh my god.

2804
02:46:32,490 --> 02:46:33,650
My wrist hurts.

2805
02:46:33,670 --> 02:46:35,250
Put enemy highlight back on too.

2806
02:46:35,730 --> 02:46:37,850
Oh yeah, we should put our enemy highlight back on.

2807
02:46:41,090 --> 02:46:41,730
Okay.

2808
02:46:43,490 --> 02:46:44,330
Holy shit.

2809
02:46:44,450 --> 02:46:45,710
That was crazy.

2810
02:46:46,190 --> 02:46:49,750
Oh my god.

2811
02:46:51,370 --> 02:46:52,570
Oh my god.

2812
02:46:53,110 --> 02:46:54,090
I can't believe it.

2813
02:46:54,150 --> 02:46:55,110
I can't believe...

2814
02:46:55,850 --> 02:46:58,350
I had 43 kills apparently.

2815
02:46:58,350 --> 02:46:59,510
What do I get?

2816
02:47:01,230 --> 02:47:01,830
Do I get the hoodie?

2817
02:47:02,090 --> 02:47:02,590
Do I get the hoodie?

2818
02:47:05,390 --> 02:47:05,750
Wait.

2819
02:47:05,950 --> 02:47:07,170
We don't know if you won.

2820
02:47:08,630 --> 02:47:10,570
I had 43.

2821
02:47:10,970 --> 02:47:13,430
Oh, I got 44.

2822
02:47:15,010 --> 02:47:16,550
You have to watch my vote of it.

2823
02:47:16,830 --> 02:47:17,790
I went around this corner.

2824
02:47:17,930 --> 02:47:19,050
It was on the edge of zone.

2825
02:47:19,590 --> 02:47:21,750
Guess how many people were there in that corner.

2826
02:47:22,750 --> 02:47:23,970
There was 15 of them.

2827
02:47:24,010 --> 02:47:24,570
I shot one.

2828
02:47:24,630 --> 02:47:25,290
I killed one guy.

2829
02:47:25,290 --> 02:47:26,710
All of them were scattered like bees.

2830
02:47:29,350 --> 02:47:31,270
It was so funny.

2831
02:47:31,670 --> 02:47:33,190
Oh my god.

2832
02:47:34,250 --> 02:47:36,150
I'm gonna go apologize to Bao.

2833
02:47:36,270 --> 02:47:37,430
I killed her.

2834
02:47:37,990 --> 02:47:38,670
I'm gonna apologize.

2835
02:47:39,450 --> 02:47:41,470
I'm sorry Bao.

2836
02:47:42,130 --> 02:47:44,330
I'm sorry for killing your team.

2837
02:47:44,710 --> 02:47:45,170
I'm sorry.

2838
02:47:45,570 --> 02:47:47,670
I didn't realize who was...

2839
02:47:49,630 --> 02:47:51,630
I didn't know.

2840
02:47:51,630 --> 02:47:58,130
If I knew it was you, If I knew it was you, I wouldn't have done it.

2841
02:47:58,190 --> 02:47:59,650
I wouldn't have done it.

2842
02:47:59,930 --> 02:48:02,070
You thought I was a good person too.

2843
02:48:02,310 --> 02:48:03,870
I trusted you.

2844
02:48:04,250 --> 02:48:05,130
I trusted you.

2845
02:48:05,470 --> 02:48:07,590
I thought that was just like a guitar in your bed.

2846
02:48:07,830 --> 02:48:08,910
Yeah, just to hide it.

2847
02:48:10,510 --> 02:48:11,390
Oh, sweet.

2848
02:48:11,530 --> 02:48:14,790
This nice old man just came up to me and wants to play the banjo.

2849
02:48:17,910 --> 02:48:18,350
Sorry.

2850
02:48:18,350 --> 02:48:20,190
I would have let you live.

2851
02:48:20,270 --> 02:48:21,990
I swear to god.

2852
02:48:22,850 --> 02:48:23,890
Me limping.

2853
02:48:23,970 --> 02:48:28,330
Me limping to the finish line with the corpses of my dead friends on my back.

2854
02:48:29,110 --> 02:48:30,150
I'm sorry.

2855
02:48:30,850 --> 02:48:31,710
Personnel kid.

2856
02:48:32,530 --> 02:48:34,410
It was a bit funny though.

2857
02:48:34,550 --> 02:48:35,570
It was a little funny though.

2858
02:48:35,670 --> 02:48:38,250
You caught me with my pants down too.

2859
02:48:38,430 --> 02:48:39,450
I was like, oh god.

2860
02:48:39,450 --> 02:48:41,750
I was like, don't worry.

2861
02:48:44,750 --> 02:48:48,290
If it makes you feel better, I did it to four other people.

2862
02:48:48,510 --> 02:48:49,410
It wasn't just you.

2863
02:48:49,930 --> 02:48:51,010
Oh, thank you.

2864
02:48:51,110 --> 02:48:53,250
It wasn't a special thing for you.

2865
02:48:53,530 --> 02:48:56,010
So I'm not even special?

2866
02:48:56,310 --> 02:48:59,050
No, I mean you are special.

2867
02:48:59,610 --> 02:49:01,390
You're the only one I felt guilty.

2868
02:49:01,690 --> 02:49:02,590
I felt guilt for.

2869
02:49:03,610 --> 02:49:05,810
I didn't feel sorry for the others.

2870
02:49:06,110 --> 02:49:08,390
I felt sorry for killing you.

2871
02:49:09,310 --> 02:49:11,250
I guess I forgive you.

2872
02:49:11,690 --> 02:49:14,530
I gotta do the interview now.

2873
02:49:14,530 --> 02:49:16,010
I'm a team genius.

2874
02:49:17,150 --> 02:49:18,590
Okay, get out of here.

2875
02:49:18,830 --> 02:49:19,810
Dookie bird.

2876
02:49:21,190 --> 02:49:22,550
Wait, where did Wig go?

2877
02:49:24,370 --> 02:49:25,250
I don't know.

2878
02:49:25,790 --> 02:49:26,250
What?

2879
02:49:26,430 --> 02:49:27,770
What do you mean you don't know?

2880
02:49:29,110 --> 02:49:30,410
He just left.

2881
02:49:30,790 --> 02:49:31,590
Wait, what?

2882
02:49:31,690 --> 02:49:32,430
Where did he go?

2883
02:49:33,330 --> 02:49:35,450
He's probably in a Discord channel with one of the teams.

2884
02:49:35,690 --> 02:49:36,210
No, he's not.

2885
02:49:36,290 --> 02:49:37,190
I'm literally looking.

2886
02:49:40,130 --> 02:49:41,590
Where did he go?

2887
02:49:44,550 --> 02:49:45,610
Where did he...

2888
02:49:45,610 --> 02:49:46,850
Where did he go?

2889
02:49:47,070 --> 02:49:47,810
He's just gone.

2890
02:49:48,070 --> 02:49:48,090
Get away!

2891
02:49:49,730 --> 02:49:51,430
You wanna Discord jackass?

2892
02:49:54,710 --> 02:49:55,830
Call them!

2893
02:49:56,410 --> 02:49:59,710
The Onika team in there.

2894
02:50:00,470 --> 02:50:01,810
Yeah, where the fuck did Wig go?

2895
02:50:03,270 --> 02:50:05,130
Oh, he's playing in the game mode?

2896
02:50:05,450 --> 02:50:07,830
We could be in this call while he explains it.

2897
02:50:15,290 --> 02:50:19,630
How is it like watching it?

2898
02:50:20,810 --> 02:50:21,970
How is it like watching it?

2899
02:50:21,970 --> 02:50:22,630
It's so entertaining.

2900
02:50:24,030 --> 02:50:25,450
Did you see what I did?

2901
02:50:25,870 --> 02:50:28,210
Did you guys see what I did to a couple of hiders?

2902
02:50:29,030 --> 02:50:29,530
No, I didn't.

2903
02:50:29,590 --> 02:50:29,950
What did you do?

2904
02:50:29,990 --> 02:50:32,850
I did the whole pretend to be a hider and watched them walk to me.

2905
02:50:32,890 --> 02:50:34,370
Oh, you got people with it?

2906
02:50:36,130 --> 02:50:37,710
You're a super villain.

2907
02:50:38,450 --> 02:50:39,830
You're a piece of shit.

2908
02:50:40,770 --> 02:50:42,010
You're evil, bro.

2909
02:50:43,010 --> 02:50:43,770
Holy shit.

2910
02:50:43,850 --> 02:50:45,070
I got several people.

2911
02:50:45,150 --> 02:50:47,590
They walked up to me and I just took my gun out.

2912
02:50:47,870 --> 02:50:49,310
Oh my god.

2913
02:50:50,850 --> 02:50:55,070
It's almost worth more than Jen Burton just having all those kills, to be honest.

2914
02:50:55,310 --> 02:50:55,870
We did it!

2915
02:50:58,090 --> 02:50:58,610
Congratulations!

2916
02:51:00,530 --> 02:51:00,610
Congratulations!

2917
02:51:01,810 --> 02:51:02,330
Congratulations!

2918
02:51:03,710 --> 02:51:05,770
The whole Japanese squad right here.

2919
02:51:05,890 --> 02:51:07,270
The Japanese...

2920
02:51:07,930 --> 02:51:09,270
The only Japanese team.

2921
02:51:10,030 --> 02:51:10,750
Oh, really?

2922
02:51:12,230 --> 02:51:13,110
I think so.

2923
02:51:13,110 --> 02:51:14,310
Japanese!

2924
02:51:15,190 --> 02:51:15,870
Japanese!

2925
02:51:16,690 --> 02:51:16,950
Yay!

2926
02:51:20,630 --> 02:51:25,170
Dash, can you ask how oneTappy is gonna feel being the princess next game?

2927
02:51:25,990 --> 02:51:27,150
Okay, okay.

2928
02:51:43,110 --> 02:51:43,350
He's a princess.

2929
02:51:47,450 --> 02:51:50,310
He's a princess, so it's natural for him to be a princess.

2930
02:51:50,870 --> 02:51:51,690
I see.

2931
02:51:52,650 --> 02:51:53,410
I see.

2932
02:51:53,770 --> 02:52:01,970
So, oneTappy, he's like a princess in general, so he doesn't see any difference.

2933
02:52:05,110 --> 02:52:07,070
He's the one princess himself.

2934
02:52:09,470 --> 02:52:10,270
There's no...

2935
02:52:12,030 --> 02:52:13,590
I have a question for you, Dash.

2936
02:52:14,510 --> 02:52:15,390
You're good, you're good.

2937
02:52:15,610 --> 02:52:16,190
No, no, go first.

2938
02:52:16,570 --> 02:52:24,750
I wanted to know who was the last player alive on the team and what their strategy was at the very end.

2939
02:52:38,150 --> 02:52:39,870
How did you survive?

2940
02:52:40,570 --> 02:52:43,910
I hid in the shadows so no one could see me.

2941
02:52:44,570 --> 02:52:45,850
You hid in the shadows?

2942
02:52:45,870 --> 02:52:48,510
Yes, I hid in the shadows and hid behind the knockers.

2943
02:52:48,870 --> 02:52:50,550
I see, I see.

2944
02:52:51,170 --> 02:52:53,670
So, Aoharu was the last one.

2945
02:52:54,070 --> 02:52:57,210
And she was like hiding behind someone's knockers.

2946
02:52:57,870 --> 02:52:58,970
Oh, that's smart.

2947
02:52:59,690 --> 02:53:00,650
Very smart.

2948
02:53:03,690 --> 02:53:04,670
Very smart.

2949
02:53:04,850 --> 02:53:07,870
Dash, how does Aoharu feel about protecting Wontabi?

2950
02:53:08,010 --> 02:53:11,070
Do they feel like they could really win the next game?

2951
02:53:11,350 --> 02:53:12,470
Are they confident in their abilities?

2952
02:53:13,210 --> 02:53:14,030
Does he feel safe?

2953
02:53:17,230 --> 02:53:17,770
Yes!

2954
02:53:18,030 --> 02:53:18,490
Yes!

2955
02:53:23,570 --> 02:53:24,930
They're very confident.

2956
02:53:25,370 --> 02:53:26,150
Let's go!

2957
02:53:27,390 --> 02:53:28,310
Fuck yeah.

2958
02:53:30,630 --> 02:53:33,650
Alright, tell them I said good luck and I wish them nothing but the best.

2959
02:53:33,650 --> 02:53:34,410
Wait, wait, wait.

2960
02:53:36,030 --> 02:53:36,830
Go for it, go for it.

2961
02:53:36,910 --> 02:53:37,230
Lock in.

2962
02:53:37,650 --> 02:53:47,430
Tell him that Madness was the one that killed him and then tell him what Madness' punishment is for game 6 so he knows we got vengeance for him.

2963
02:53:47,730 --> 02:53:50,650
I already told him that he's going to get punishment.

2964
02:53:51,430 --> 02:53:52,430
How does he feel though?

2965
02:53:53,030 --> 02:53:55,150
Yeah, how does he feel?

2966
02:53:55,350 --> 02:53:56,210
How does he feel about it?

2967
02:53:57,590 --> 02:53:58,710
Madness got punished.

2968
02:53:59,910 --> 02:54:00,650
How do you feel?

2969
02:54:03,590 --> 02:54:04,490
He's great.

2970
02:54:06,430 --> 02:54:07,910
He wants more.

2971
02:54:08,730 --> 02:54:10,270
He wants more?

2972
02:54:11,870 --> 02:54:12,770
What do you want him?

2973
02:54:12,970 --> 02:54:14,690
We have to ask him what he wants.

2974
02:54:30,650 --> 02:54:31,310
The first one to go is W.

2975
02:54:33,730 --> 02:54:40,490
So he wants that Madness if he taps the W, he goes to the behind.

2976
02:54:41,070 --> 02:54:43,310
And if he taps the S, he goes to the front.

2977
02:54:44,830 --> 02:54:45,350
Inverted control.

2978
02:54:46,590 --> 02:54:47,370
Do it.

2979
02:54:48,830 --> 02:54:49,970
We should do it.

2980
02:54:50,490 --> 02:54:52,310
Alright, well how about we change the...

2981
02:54:52,310 --> 02:54:55,150
Okay, so he wants to add it on with the inverted aim?

2982
02:54:56,210 --> 02:54:56,430
Yeah.

2983
02:54:56,430 --> 02:54:59,470
Ah, that's a doki call.

2984
02:54:59,850 --> 02:55:00,770
Yeah, we should do it.

2985
02:55:00,810 --> 02:55:01,550
I'm down.

2986
02:55:02,630 --> 02:55:03,190
I'm so down.

2987
02:55:05,570 --> 02:55:06,070
No, no, no.

2988
02:55:06,110 --> 02:55:06,850
Tom, we're with him.

2989
02:55:06,950 --> 02:55:07,590
Tom, we agree.

2990
02:55:10,630 --> 02:55:12,310
I'll deliver the bad news to Madness.

2991
02:55:12,750 --> 02:55:13,430
I'll deliver the bad news to Madness.

2992
02:55:13,610 --> 02:55:16,490
Instead of C, the mouse will be inverted.

2993
02:55:18,050 --> 02:55:18,910
That's totally fine.

2994
02:55:19,770 --> 02:55:20,610
That's not bad.

2995
02:55:23,290 --> 02:55:24,430
Alright, let's do it.

2996
02:55:26,430 --> 02:55:27,930
That's too bad.

2997
02:55:29,710 --> 02:55:29,870
Alright.

2998
02:55:30,750 --> 02:55:32,330
How about we say good luck in game 6?

2999
02:55:32,590 --> 02:55:32,930
Or game 5?

3000
02:55:33,810 --> 02:55:35,550
Alright, good luck next time.

3001
02:55:35,870 --> 02:55:36,270
Okay.

3002
02:55:37,090 --> 02:55:37,850
Bye-bye.

3003
02:55:39,890 --> 02:55:40,690
Bye-bye.

3004
02:55:42,390 --> 02:55:43,970
I'm gonna go tell Madness right now.

3005
02:55:44,910 --> 02:55:46,370
Alright, good luck guys.

3006
02:55:47,650 --> 02:55:50,870
So he has to do the inverted on top of everything we just did?

3007
02:55:50,890 --> 02:55:51,070
Yeah.

3008
02:55:53,050 --> 02:55:55,090
He might as well just turn the screen off.

3009
02:55:55,090 --> 02:55:56,010
Perfect.

3010
02:56:00,330 --> 02:56:03,530
Alright, I'll see you guys in the next game.

3011
02:56:03,570 --> 02:56:04,470
Oh my god.

3012
02:56:06,750 --> 02:56:09,150
Are you ready for Princess?

3013
02:56:09,530 --> 02:56:09,730
What should I play?

3014
02:56:10,570 --> 02:56:12,910
You're just here to carry your stuff.

3015
02:56:14,450 --> 02:56:16,790
Should I play Crypto?

3016
02:56:17,650 --> 02:56:18,690
Crypto so you can hide.

3017
02:56:18,810 --> 02:56:19,610
You can be invisible.

3018
02:56:20,510 --> 02:56:21,790
I can help you guys.

3019
02:56:21,790 --> 02:56:24,470
But the moment you show your head, they're gonna shoot you.

3020
02:56:24,610 --> 02:56:25,310
Because you don't have a gun.

3021
02:56:28,930 --> 02:56:33,150
Okay, are you really confident that you will be okay?

3022
02:56:35,290 --> 02:56:37,270
I'm literally a pack mule for you guys.

3023
02:56:40,130 --> 02:56:44,590
Yeah, but then what if he dies?

3024
02:56:44,990 --> 02:56:45,990
One of us could be Loba.

3025
02:56:46,970 --> 02:56:47,830
I can Q out.

3026
02:56:48,110 --> 02:56:48,650
That's true.

3027
02:56:48,650 --> 02:56:50,870
But I feel like being invisible...

3028
02:56:51,370 --> 02:56:52,210
Let's feed you guys grenades.

3029
02:56:52,310 --> 02:56:53,550
And you guys can throw grenades at him.

3030
02:56:53,830 --> 02:56:54,810
That's true.

3031
02:56:55,730 --> 02:56:56,770
We could.

3032
02:56:57,710 --> 02:57:00,490
The Crypto, I can only EMP and that's literally it.

3033
02:57:00,990 --> 02:57:02,310
And give you wallhacks.

3034
02:57:02,530 --> 02:57:03,510
Yeah, but that's good.

3035
02:57:03,890 --> 02:57:05,550
So then we can get the wallhacks.

3036
02:57:05,730 --> 02:57:07,850
But then you're safer being invisible.

3037
02:57:08,370 --> 02:57:08,890
That's the thing.

3038
02:57:09,190 --> 02:57:11,670
The only issue is that what if they shoot your drone?

3039
02:57:12,070 --> 02:57:13,550
What if they shoot your drone?

3040
02:57:13,870 --> 02:57:15,150
I'm basically useless.

3041
02:57:15,650 --> 02:57:16,410
Okay, okay.

3042
02:57:17,050 --> 02:57:17,990
Fuse or Loba?

3043
02:57:18,150 --> 02:57:21,210
Wait, did we just play Lifeline in Newcastle?

3044
02:57:22,370 --> 02:57:23,250
Play Newcastle again?

3045
02:57:23,630 --> 02:57:24,250
Do we do that?

3046
02:57:25,110 --> 02:57:27,730
If we're going to be inside most of the time then...

3047
02:57:27,730 --> 02:57:29,170
Yeah, we just gotta find a house.

3048
02:57:29,350 --> 02:57:30,710
And give you a little house.

3049
02:57:30,950 --> 02:57:33,170
Is this one like Zone 1, no one fires?

3050
02:57:33,490 --> 02:57:34,950
No, we can fire.

3051
02:57:35,090 --> 02:57:37,230
But it's very dangerous if the princess dies.

3052
02:57:38,710 --> 02:57:40,030
We need to get into Zone.

3053
02:57:40,210 --> 02:57:42,330
But the thing is we don't have any ring console character.

3054
02:57:42,330 --> 02:57:43,230
Yeah.

3055
02:57:44,050 --> 02:57:46,530
I mean you can predict the zone, I believe in you, Jen.

3056
02:57:47,070 --> 02:57:47,750
Okay, I believe.

3057
02:57:48,130 --> 02:57:50,030
Harvest's team is only a duo.

3058
02:57:50,470 --> 02:57:51,950
Oh wait, no, they're...

3059
02:57:51,950 --> 02:57:54,670
He came back, he's just getting back on now.

3060
02:57:54,870 --> 02:57:55,690
That's why we're just waiting for that.

3061
02:57:56,310 --> 02:57:58,310
Are we able to buff them game 6 somehow?

3062
02:57:58,450 --> 02:57:59,290
Is that a...

3063
02:57:59,290 --> 02:58:00,770
How do we buff them?

3064
02:58:01,150 --> 02:58:02,810
We should buff them and Bao's team.

3065
02:58:02,910 --> 02:58:04,190
But how do we buff them?

3066
02:58:05,750 --> 02:58:08,510
How do we buff somebody in a normal Apex game?

3067
02:58:09,130 --> 02:58:10,850
We need Destroyer in here.

3068
02:58:10,850 --> 02:58:14,670
Okay, Destroyer come in, just give them walls.

3069
02:58:15,530 --> 02:58:16,650
Just give them aim assist.

3070
02:58:18,270 --> 02:58:21,050
Well, my chat's saying no princess, but do you think that's too strong?

3071
02:58:21,150 --> 02:58:21,930
It probably is too strong, right?

3072
02:58:22,470 --> 02:58:23,490
No princess at all?

3073
02:58:23,650 --> 02:58:24,250
No princess?

3074
02:58:25,110 --> 02:58:26,810
We'll just be like princesses can use guns.

3075
02:58:26,950 --> 02:58:29,070
We'll say like these teams...

3076
02:58:29,070 --> 02:58:30,330
Yeah, we can be like...

3077
02:58:30,330 --> 02:58:32,150
Okay, so I think it should be like...

3078
02:58:32,770 --> 02:58:35,790
Chibidoki's team, Bao's team, and...

3079
02:58:35,790 --> 02:58:36,890
Gerard's team.

3080
02:58:37,010 --> 02:58:37,670
I'll say that.

3081
02:58:37,670 --> 02:58:39,670
Okay, I'll do that.

3082
02:58:39,670 --> 02:58:41,750
I'll go inform Gerard's team.

3083
02:58:42,410 --> 02:58:47,290
Armus, Bao, and Chibi...

3084
02:58:47,290 --> 02:58:49,090
Is there any other team that needs help?

3085
02:58:49,610 --> 02:58:50,650
Or is it just those...

3086
02:58:50,650 --> 02:58:51,730
Okay, and FaZe Connect.

3087
02:58:52,290 --> 02:58:57,570
FaZe Connect, you princesses can hold guns.

3088
02:58:58,470 --> 02:59:04,510
And Master plus Master slash Prince can hold two guns.

3089
02:59:04,510 --> 02:59:06,770
We have Grand Q.

3090
02:59:08,370 --> 02:59:08,830
Power.

3091
02:59:10,310 --> 02:59:12,010
They have insane power.

3092
02:59:20,240 --> 02:59:21,920
Isn't that insane?

3093
02:59:22,520 --> 02:59:24,940
Okay, they need the buff though.

3094
02:59:25,080 --> 02:59:26,120
They need it.

3095
02:59:27,880 --> 02:59:28,700
No, they'll be fine.

3096
02:59:29,200 --> 02:59:29,940
FaZe can get ring console.

3097
02:59:30,300 --> 02:59:31,400
FaZe can get ring console.

3098
02:59:32,040 --> 02:59:35,500
The thing is, three of those teams...

3099
02:59:35,500 --> 02:59:37,800
Only two of those teams don't have a Master Pred.

3100
02:59:39,380 --> 02:59:40,100
Yes.

3101
02:59:42,840 --> 02:59:45,780
You can use...

3102
02:59:45,780 --> 02:59:47,220
Your team gets...

3103
02:59:47,220 --> 02:59:49,920
Your team gets granted a little buff.

3104
02:59:52,040 --> 02:59:54,260
Courtesy of the casters.

3105
02:59:57,260 --> 02:59:59,040
I think we'll go FaZe, no cap.

3106
02:59:59,640 --> 03:00:01,820
Casters granted you a power.

3107
03:00:05,500 --> 03:00:06,760
It's the casters' decision.

3108
03:00:10,760 --> 03:00:11,980
Poor Madness.

3109
03:00:12,980 --> 03:00:15,120
He shouldn't have fucking killed that one Tappy.

3110
03:00:19,120 --> 03:00:20,560
70 FOVs.

3111
03:00:21,700 --> 03:00:23,280
Invert W and S key.

3112
03:00:23,360 --> 03:00:24,640
Invert mouse direction.

3113
03:00:24,840 --> 03:00:25,980
And then the rest in Japanese.

3114
03:00:26,080 --> 03:00:29,240
Bro, casters have no chill.

3115
03:00:29,240 --> 03:00:29,840
They have no chill.

3116
03:00:30,100 --> 03:00:38,800
He can still shoot his gun.

3117
03:00:39,840 --> 03:00:40,640
It's possible.

3118
03:00:40,900 --> 03:00:41,740
I believe.

3119
03:00:42,200 --> 03:00:43,560
Do you see the clip I sent you?

3120
03:00:43,700 --> 03:00:45,960
Show your chat.

3121
03:00:46,420 --> 03:00:47,360
What is this?

3122
03:00:47,440 --> 03:00:48,880
Scattered like roaches.

3123
03:00:52,480 --> 03:00:54,180
What is this?

3124
03:00:56,040 --> 03:00:58,040
What the fuck?

3125
03:00:58,920 --> 03:00:59,820
Holy shit.

3126
03:00:59,840 --> 03:01:00,440
That's what I'm saying.

3127
03:01:00,480 --> 03:01:01,460
There's one guy.

3128
03:01:05,420 --> 03:01:06,640
Disturbing the nest.

3129
03:01:08,200 --> 03:01:09,160
Not one guy.

3130
03:01:09,400 --> 03:01:11,180
Like 20 people showed up.

3131
03:01:11,200 --> 03:01:12,520
20 people came to help her.

3132
03:01:12,520 --> 03:01:13,900
What the fuck?

3133
03:01:16,060 --> 03:01:18,940
I didn't think to see so many.

3134
03:01:20,680 --> 03:01:22,640
Oh my god.

3135
03:01:23,520 --> 03:01:24,640
That's fucking crazy.

3136
03:01:26,440 --> 03:01:27,740
Oh my god.

3137
03:01:28,780 --> 03:01:29,960
Okay, we can have...

3138
03:01:29,960 --> 03:01:33,380
Let me see if Greek or Whig are willing to play with them.

3139
03:01:34,800 --> 03:01:36,760
Are you guys willing to sub in for Artemis?

3140
03:01:37,460 --> 03:01:37,960
For a game?

3141
03:01:38,100 --> 03:01:39,600
I think Tempo should be their princess.

3142
03:01:39,940 --> 03:01:41,760
No, they have no princess.

3143
03:01:41,980 --> 03:01:43,920
The princess can hold the gun.

3144
03:01:45,060 --> 03:01:46,420
Alright, Tempo, get in there.

3145
03:01:46,760 --> 03:01:47,160
Join them.

3146
03:01:48,040 --> 03:01:48,560
Yeah, you're shooting.

3147
03:01:48,560 --> 03:01:49,360
You get to shoot.

3148
03:01:50,580 --> 03:01:51,780
Minus Tempo.

3149
03:01:52,100 --> 03:01:54,060
Who will be joining Artemis?

3150
03:01:54,100 --> 03:01:54,920
Oh my god.

3151
03:01:54,920 --> 03:01:57,960
If I turn my head, I have map hacks.

3152
03:02:01,060 --> 03:02:04,540
What the fuck?

3153
03:02:06,100 --> 03:02:06,340
Alright.

3154
03:02:06,800 --> 03:02:08,020
Tempo's joining them.

3155
03:02:09,680 --> 03:02:11,040
Tempo's joining their team.

3156
03:02:11,620 --> 03:02:12,780
In returns.

3157
03:02:16,260 --> 03:02:17,160
Alright, I believe.

3158
03:02:17,160 --> 03:02:19,300
I believe in this team.

3159
03:02:19,800 --> 03:02:20,960
They have...

3160
03:02:20,960 --> 03:02:23,160
They literally have the host advantage.

3161
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:25,160
They can't fuck it up.

3162
03:02:26,620 --> 03:02:27,880
There's no way.

3163
03:02:30,280 --> 03:02:30,900
Alright.

3164
03:02:31,980 --> 03:02:34,180
They literally have host advantage.

3165
03:02:35,580 --> 03:02:37,820
They get to look at endzone.

3166
03:02:38,920 --> 03:02:41,480
They can put the fucking princess at the endzone.

3167
03:02:47,090 --> 03:02:48,390
Oh my god.

3168
03:02:48,390 --> 03:02:49,710
You have to watch this, Doki.

3169
03:02:50,070 --> 03:02:51,090
You have to watch this.

3170
03:02:52,530 --> 03:02:54,390
This is from Gerard's POV.

3171
03:02:55,150 --> 03:02:56,310
What did you do to him?

3172
03:02:57,410 --> 03:02:58,850
No, no, it's so funny.

3173
03:03:02,990 --> 03:03:04,010
I'm gonna play Fuse, by the way.

3174
03:03:14,910 --> 03:03:16,650
Oh my god.

3175
03:03:23,710 --> 03:03:26,510
Oh my god.

3176
03:03:26,570 --> 03:03:27,570
Oh my god, that's so good.

3177
03:03:29,030 --> 03:03:31,310
Oh my god.

3178
03:03:31,310 --> 03:03:31,490
That's so good.

3179
03:03:32,590 --> 03:03:33,850
Okay, we're starting a server.

3180
03:03:33,990 --> 03:03:37,150
Oh no, is it because Tempo joined in that the server takes fucking forever?

3181
03:03:38,330 --> 03:03:38,770
Yeah.

3182
03:03:38,870 --> 03:03:39,890
Is that a thing, too?

3183
03:03:40,130 --> 03:03:41,470
Fuck Tempo, man.

3184
03:03:41,470 --> 03:03:42,790
Wait, is that true?

3185
03:03:42,910 --> 03:03:43,470
Kick him.

3186
03:03:43,630 --> 03:03:47,950
Remove his co- If there's a new person in the server, it takes a long time?

3187
03:03:48,990 --> 03:03:50,270
Remove the co-host from him.

3188
03:03:51,170 --> 03:03:52,630
This is the co-host.

3189
03:03:53,110 --> 03:03:55,810
This is the co-host's fault.

3190
03:04:00,540 --> 03:04:01,240
Oh my god.

3191
03:04:01,240 --> 03:04:01,620
I'm gonna be right back.

3192
03:04:01,680 --> 03:04:02,900
I'm gonna get a cough drop.

3193
03:04:04,340 --> 03:04:04,600
Okay.

3194
03:04:17,580 --> 03:04:19,300
Can we ban this Gooner guy?

3195
03:04:19,460 --> 03:04:19,800
Interesting.

3196
03:04:26,590 --> 03:04:28,150
Taking so long!

3197
03:04:31,450 --> 03:04:33,250
What are we waiting for?

3198
03:04:35,170 --> 03:04:37,110
Oh my gosh, my...

3199
03:04:37,110 --> 03:04:40,130
My, like, mouse is, like, fucking up.

3200
03:04:40,570 --> 03:04:41,130
Oh no.

3201
03:04:41,130 --> 03:04:43,510
Oh no, this is so bad.

3202
03:04:43,750 --> 03:04:45,270
Doki doki doki doki, hear me out.

3203
03:04:45,270 --> 03:04:45,610
This is so bad.

3204
03:04:45,930 --> 03:04:46,870
My mouse is fucking up.

3205
03:04:47,570 --> 03:04:48,150
What is it?

3206
03:04:48,610 --> 03:04:49,750
Use controller, you'll be fine.

3207
03:04:49,910 --> 03:04:50,550
You'll never disconnect.

3208
03:04:51,910 --> 03:04:52,870
Use DDR pad.

3209
03:04:54,410 --> 03:04:56,030
Doki, it's time to switch to controller.

3210
03:04:56,210 --> 03:04:57,370
Come on, come to the backside.

3211
03:04:58,890 --> 03:04:59,910
You're better than this.

3212
03:05:00,270 --> 03:05:01,350
I have integrity!

3213
03:05:02,470 --> 03:05:06,290
How about if I give you my free Battle Beaver controller with GenBurden, you know?

3214
03:05:06,590 --> 03:05:06,890
What?

3215
03:05:07,970 --> 03:05:08,570
Signed on it.

3216
03:05:09,110 --> 03:05:10,750
Do you use the controller or not?

3217
03:05:10,970 --> 03:05:11,570
Oh yeah, no, no.

3218
03:05:11,830 --> 03:05:14,370
Yeah, you can send it to me and maybe you'll see it on eBay.

3219
03:05:16,570 --> 03:05:17,650
Make sure you sign it too.

3220
03:05:17,750 --> 03:05:19,030
Oh yeah, can you sign it for me?

3221
03:05:19,450 --> 03:05:22,410
Oh my god, can I have your autograph on that controller as well?

3222
03:05:23,290 --> 03:05:25,110
I would love to have your autograph.

3223
03:05:28,350 --> 03:05:29,770
How much are you selling it for though?

3224
03:05:30,170 --> 03:05:31,210
Can I get a commission?

3225
03:05:32,970 --> 03:05:34,150
I'm not gonna sell it.

3226
03:05:34,230 --> 03:05:35,330
What are you talking about?

3227
03:05:35,330 --> 03:05:38,230
I'm not gonna sell it.

3228
03:05:39,910 --> 03:05:41,750
I don't know what you're saying.

3229
03:05:42,550 --> 03:05:46,090
I would never do something that fucked up.

3230
03:05:48,930 --> 03:05:52,390
Alright, wait, what are we playing?

3231
03:05:52,490 --> 03:05:53,170
I don't even know.

3232
03:05:53,410 --> 03:05:54,250
I'm playing Fuse-y.

3233
03:05:54,670 --> 03:05:55,370
You're playing Fuse-y?

3234
03:05:56,910 --> 03:05:58,150
What about me?

3235
03:05:58,850 --> 03:05:59,490
Lifeline, right?

3236
03:06:00,150 --> 03:06:00,570
Lifeline?

3237
03:06:00,690 --> 03:06:00,890
Okay.

3238
03:06:02,170 --> 03:06:06,130
I think I was thinking Fuse because like, I don't know, Lobo's gonna be eh.

3239
03:06:06,710 --> 03:06:08,290
And then we're gonna run out of loot again.

3240
03:06:09,490 --> 03:06:10,570
We gotta find a house.

3241
03:06:11,530 --> 03:06:13,390
Yeah, yeah, we gotta go into a house and chill.

3242
03:06:13,550 --> 03:06:14,070
You smell me?

3243
03:06:15,350 --> 03:06:17,350
Where would be the priority for my walls?

3244
03:06:18,410 --> 03:06:18,770
Priority?

3245
03:06:19,690 --> 03:06:21,950
It would be like a corner, like hugging the wall.

3246
03:06:22,570 --> 03:06:23,650
If that makes sense.

3247
03:06:23,930 --> 03:06:26,230
Or blocking off a doorway or something.

3248
03:06:26,570 --> 03:06:27,030
I'll let you know.

3249
03:06:27,650 --> 03:06:28,690
Where are we?

3250
03:06:28,770 --> 03:06:29,630
Where are we landing now?

3251
03:06:35,190 --> 03:06:36,070
It's good.

3252
03:06:36,430 --> 03:06:38,410
It should be fine.

3253
03:06:39,390 --> 03:06:39,650
Yeah.

3254
03:06:40,210 --> 03:06:41,610
I'm a princess, guys.

3255
03:06:42,430 --> 03:06:43,410
Princess, no.

3256
03:06:44,710 --> 03:06:48,150
Princess, don't remember not to carry any anything.

3257
03:06:48,750 --> 03:06:49,810
Any guns, princess.

3258
03:06:51,350 --> 03:06:54,770
You've literally broken every single rule in each map.

3259
03:06:54,770 --> 03:06:56,770
I've never broken a rule in my life.

3260
03:06:56,990 --> 03:07:00,550
You held two guns in hide and seek.

3261
03:07:00,850 --> 03:07:02,170
I saw it.

3262
03:07:02,370 --> 03:07:04,190
Hide and seek or the other one?

3263
03:07:05,510 --> 03:07:07,350
You broke a rule in every game.

3264
03:07:07,450 --> 03:07:08,210
What are you talking about?

3265
03:07:08,590 --> 03:07:10,630
You shot a gun in melee.

3266
03:07:11,610 --> 03:07:12,810
Did you not do that?

3267
03:07:12,890 --> 03:07:13,990
You shot a gun in melee.

3268
03:07:14,490 --> 03:07:16,650
Yeah, but that's to break the gender right to talk.

3269
03:07:16,670 --> 03:07:18,230
Yeah, but you still shot your gun.

3270
03:07:18,390 --> 03:07:19,230
You still did it.

3271
03:07:19,370 --> 03:07:20,070
Did you not?

3272
03:07:20,790 --> 03:07:22,750
I did, but I didn't shoot it at people.

3273
03:07:22,750 --> 03:07:24,110
That wasn't in the rules.

3274
03:07:24,490 --> 03:07:26,830
Yeah, but you weren't supposed to carry a gun, though.

3275
03:07:26,930 --> 03:07:27,510
Right, Altair?

3276
03:07:28,090 --> 03:07:29,070
You read the rules.

3277
03:07:29,350 --> 03:07:30,350
We trusted you.

3278
03:07:30,670 --> 03:07:32,110
Oh, yeah, I know, right?

3279
03:07:32,170 --> 03:07:33,030
We trusted you.

3280
03:07:34,210 --> 03:07:35,490
You threw a grenade.

3281
03:07:35,650 --> 03:07:38,030
You threw a grenade in sniper only.

3282
03:07:38,510 --> 03:07:39,770
They could have died to that grenade.

3283
03:07:40,190 --> 03:07:40,470
Yeah.

3284
03:07:42,490 --> 03:07:44,690
I'm just saying some rules are meant to be broken.

3285
03:07:45,010 --> 03:07:46,030
That's all I'm gonna say.

3286
03:07:46,370 --> 03:07:47,470
That's all I'm gonna say.

3287
03:07:48,490 --> 03:07:50,090
Not in these customs.

3288
03:07:50,090 --> 03:07:51,790
Especially Doki's rules.

3289
03:07:51,910 --> 03:07:53,050
They're supposed to be broken.

3290
03:07:53,790 --> 03:07:56,530
I'm trying to balance it as best I could.

3291
03:07:59,510 --> 03:08:04,070
I'm trying to make this as balanced as I can right now.

3292
03:08:06,410 --> 03:08:06,930
Okay.

3293
03:08:08,150 --> 03:08:09,070
Oh, my gosh.

3294
03:08:09,230 --> 03:08:10,790
What are you writing, Altair?

3295
03:08:11,690 --> 03:08:13,650
I'm writing all the grenades for you guys, by the way.

3296
03:08:13,990 --> 03:08:14,430
Wait, what?

3297
03:08:15,910 --> 03:08:17,070
Wait, what did you say, Jen?

3298
03:08:17,970 --> 03:08:19,830
I have all the grenades for you guys.

3299
03:08:20,230 --> 03:08:21,530
You're not throwing it at them.

3300
03:08:21,590 --> 03:08:22,650
Okay, I have light ammo.

3301
03:08:23,190 --> 03:08:25,070
Hold light ammo for me.

3302
03:08:25,690 --> 03:08:26,010
What?

3303
03:08:26,190 --> 03:08:26,950
Okay, fine.

3304
03:08:26,970 --> 03:08:28,250
You're literally the princess.

3305
03:08:28,430 --> 03:08:29,210
You have to.

3306
03:08:29,470 --> 03:08:30,610
Say pretty please.

3307
03:08:30,830 --> 03:08:32,670
No, you might as well just die.

3308
03:08:33,030 --> 03:08:34,450
You might as well just die.

3309
03:08:35,110 --> 03:08:36,750
I'm holding you the light ammo, then.

3310
03:08:37,010 --> 03:08:37,430
Fuck you.

3311
03:08:39,310 --> 03:08:40,550
Altair, you say it.

3312
03:08:40,970 --> 03:08:41,830
Pretty please.

3313
03:08:42,610 --> 03:08:44,090
Okay, I got you, Altair.

3314
03:08:44,510 --> 03:08:45,230
Good boy.

3315
03:08:50,690 --> 03:08:51,750
You enabled him.

3316
03:08:52,030 --> 03:08:52,750
You enabled him.

3317
03:08:52,810 --> 03:08:53,670
I told you not to.

3318
03:08:53,730 --> 03:08:57,030
I told you not to enable him.

3319
03:08:58,370 --> 03:08:59,550
Where do we go, Jen?

3320
03:09:01,030 --> 03:09:01,590
Princess Jen?

3321
03:09:01,590 --> 03:09:03,530
Let's go here, and then we get the Rincon Sal.

3322
03:09:04,030 --> 03:09:05,630
Princess Jen, where do we go?

3323
03:09:06,490 --> 03:09:07,850
Do I have to talk like a princess, too?

3324
03:09:08,050 --> 03:09:09,430
Yeah, how would you talk like a princess?

3325
03:09:10,710 --> 03:09:12,030
Yeah, posh.

3326
03:09:12,030 --> 03:09:13,610
Give us posh, Jen.

3327
03:09:14,390 --> 03:09:16,030
Fuck, isn't that like...

3328
03:09:16,730 --> 03:09:18,150
Oh, they don't say that word.

3329
03:09:20,170 --> 03:09:22,690
Is that what you see, posh people?

3330
03:09:23,170 --> 03:09:24,070
Asking for fucking tea?

3331
03:09:24,070 --> 03:09:27,750
They drink their tea with their pinkies lifted.

3332
03:09:28,150 --> 03:09:28,690
Don't you know that?

3333
03:09:29,710 --> 03:09:31,830
Ask us to go to afternoon tea or something.

3334
03:09:32,310 --> 03:09:32,950
Go for it.

3335
03:09:33,870 --> 03:09:35,630
You guys want some afternoon tea?

3336
03:09:35,630 --> 03:09:40,570
You're pretty good.

3337
03:09:41,510 --> 03:09:43,470
You have such a good accent.

3338
03:09:43,850 --> 03:09:44,990
Thank you.

3339
03:09:45,190 --> 03:09:45,770
Appreciate that.

3340
03:09:48,750 --> 03:09:49,910
Oh, Princess Jen.

3341
03:09:50,170 --> 03:09:52,130
What is the life of Princess Jen?

3342
03:09:52,310 --> 03:09:54,770
What do you have to do today as a princess?

3343
03:09:56,690 --> 03:09:57,210
Carry.

3344
03:09:58,050 --> 03:09:59,650
Carry guys' fat asses.

3345
03:10:00,770 --> 03:10:03,190
Carry the weight of the country on your shoulders, right?

3346
03:10:03,470 --> 03:10:04,750
Princess, no, you can't.

3347
03:10:04,910 --> 03:10:05,610
Don't use that word.

3348
03:10:05,610 --> 03:10:07,250
Use all your strength, Princess.

3349
03:10:07,390 --> 03:10:08,430
You gotta rest.

3350
03:10:09,890 --> 03:10:10,490
No resting.

3351
03:10:10,710 --> 03:10:11,410
We gotta win this.

3352
03:10:11,850 --> 03:10:14,490
You can't hurt your dainty little hands.

3353
03:10:15,110 --> 03:10:16,270
Hello, guys.

3354
03:10:16,410 --> 03:10:17,370
Come on, where are you?

3355
03:10:17,410 --> 03:10:18,270
Where's my bodyguards?

3356
03:10:19,030 --> 03:10:21,010
Princess is gonna die so fast.

3357
03:10:21,750 --> 03:10:23,150
Princess, don't run away.

3358
03:10:23,470 --> 03:10:24,650
How are you supposed to...

3359
03:10:24,650 --> 03:10:26,570
I need backup support right now.

3360
03:10:26,770 --> 03:10:28,610
Why do you keep running away from us?

3361
03:10:28,730 --> 03:10:29,910
Do you hate this life so much?

3362
03:10:30,330 --> 03:10:31,310
Princess, please.

3363
03:10:33,210 --> 03:10:34,330
We're just trying to help.

3364
03:10:34,470 --> 03:10:35,150
Oh my god.

3365
03:10:37,970 --> 03:10:38,450
Help.

3366
03:10:39,330 --> 03:10:40,870
You have a duty to uphold.

3367
03:10:41,330 --> 03:10:42,910
Altair, I got purple knocked out for you.

3368
03:10:42,930 --> 03:10:43,890
I'll put a Q right here.

3369
03:10:45,170 --> 03:10:46,030
Come to me.

3370
03:10:47,930 --> 03:10:50,610
I just realized we're letting Rollerplayer IGL.

3371
03:10:52,330 --> 03:10:53,530
Wait, what does that mean?

3372
03:10:53,850 --> 03:10:55,190
Can you Q this, Altair?

3373
03:10:55,610 --> 03:10:55,970
Okay, here.

3374
03:10:56,370 --> 03:10:57,770
Take this.

3375
03:10:58,410 --> 03:10:59,870
This is good for you, I think.

3376
03:11:00,590 --> 03:11:01,290
It's not Q-ing.

3377
03:11:01,390 --> 03:11:01,730
It's not Q-ing.

3378
03:11:01,850 --> 03:11:03,230
It's not Q-ing.

3379
03:11:05,150 --> 03:11:05,750
It's not Q-ing.

3380
03:11:05,750 --> 03:11:09,030
Come, come, come.

3381
03:11:09,350 --> 03:11:10,630
It wasn't Q-ing.

3382
03:11:12,190 --> 03:11:13,810
I have to check my things.

3383
03:11:14,050 --> 03:11:14,530
Wait, what happened?

3384
03:11:14,810 --> 03:11:15,730
What did you guys miss?

3385
03:11:16,730 --> 03:11:18,270
Altair, take my purple knockdown.

3386
03:11:19,130 --> 03:11:21,090
Oh, I don't have it binded to Q.

3387
03:11:21,270 --> 03:11:22,950
You don't have Q bind!

3388
03:11:22,950 --> 03:11:26,910
What am I playing with?

3389
03:11:28,690 --> 03:11:30,390
That's your body, guys.

3390
03:11:30,430 --> 03:11:31,650
There's a team up there.

3391
03:11:32,010 --> 03:11:34,150
What about PR?

3392
03:11:34,470 --> 03:11:35,910
We're fine, right?

3393
03:11:37,970 --> 03:11:39,230
Climb up, guys.

3394
03:11:39,490 --> 03:11:40,330
I'm climbing up.

3395
03:11:40,550 --> 03:11:41,530
I can't climb up here.

3396
03:11:43,830 --> 03:11:44,870
We're so...

3397
03:11:44,870 --> 03:11:45,790
I'm backing up.

3398
03:11:47,590 --> 03:11:48,570
Don't worry, Princess.

3399
03:11:48,730 --> 03:11:49,850
I got a drone following you.

3400
03:11:49,850 --> 03:11:50,830
They're chasing us for some reason.

3401
03:11:50,930 --> 03:11:52,950
I think it's the three-man team.

3402
03:11:53,750 --> 03:11:54,610
Don't worry.

3403
03:11:55,590 --> 03:11:56,570
Heal up, Altair.

3404
03:11:57,250 --> 03:11:58,130
I got Altair.

3405
03:11:59,430 --> 03:12:00,550
Good shit.

3406
03:12:00,990 --> 03:12:02,210
Why are they chasing us, dude?

3407
03:12:02,390 --> 03:12:02,730
They're not.

3408
03:12:07,430 --> 03:12:08,790
Just run, Jen.

3409
03:12:09,190 --> 03:12:10,950
We're body blocking you.

3410
03:12:11,650 --> 03:12:12,530
Run, Princess.

3411
03:12:13,010 --> 03:12:15,410
Your life is so important to us.

3412
03:12:15,970 --> 03:12:16,850
There's a team right here.

3413
03:12:16,850 --> 03:12:17,590
That matters.

3414
03:12:17,690 --> 03:12:20,410
I saw an ability there.

3415
03:12:20,850 --> 03:12:22,130
Go back.

3416
03:12:22,850 --> 03:12:24,270
Oh my god.

3417
03:12:25,290 --> 03:12:26,110
They all want us.

3418
03:12:26,190 --> 03:12:26,690
I'm getting down.

3419
03:12:26,990 --> 03:12:27,950
Get down, Princess.

3420
03:12:28,210 --> 03:12:29,570
We're body blocking for you.

3421
03:12:34,810 --> 03:12:37,570
I think we're good.

3422
03:12:37,730 --> 03:12:38,730
We can come get this juicer.

3423
03:12:39,070 --> 03:12:39,550
There's a guy.

3424
03:12:39,770 --> 03:12:40,330
What?

3425
03:12:40,930 --> 03:12:41,390
What?

3426
03:12:44,050 --> 03:12:44,930
I can kill him.

3427
03:12:45,030 --> 03:12:45,610
I'm gonna ult him.

3428
03:12:46,890 --> 03:12:47,910
No, he moved.

3429
03:12:48,410 --> 03:12:49,870
The princess moved.

3430
03:12:51,490 --> 03:12:52,510
I'm going left.

3431
03:12:52,670 --> 03:12:53,070
Fuck it.

3432
03:12:54,770 --> 03:12:55,370
That's fine.

3433
03:12:55,530 --> 03:12:57,210
We chased the princess away.

3434
03:12:57,730 --> 03:12:59,010
There's a princess in the corner.

3435
03:13:00,010 --> 03:13:01,130
Get down, Miss Princess.

3436
03:13:03,490 --> 03:13:04,330
I got you.

3437
03:13:04,450 --> 03:13:05,130
There's a...

3438
03:13:05,130 --> 03:13:06,250
Wait, there's no one over there.

3439
03:13:06,250 --> 03:13:06,830
Okay.

3440
03:13:08,410 --> 03:13:10,050
Why is everyone on us right now?

3441
03:13:10,050 --> 03:13:11,730
Our princess is so ahead.

3442
03:13:11,950 --> 03:13:12,530
I don't know.

3443
03:13:14,810 --> 03:13:16,410
I got my high heels on.

3444
03:13:16,430 --> 03:13:16,850
I'm running.

3445
03:13:17,630 --> 03:13:19,690
I'm running with my high heels.

3446
03:13:20,130 --> 03:13:21,710
We don't have your youthful energy.

3447
03:13:22,150 --> 03:13:27,110
You're gonna run into a three-man and then we just have to fucking stand and die.

3448
03:13:27,370 --> 03:13:27,850
Okay, Doki.

3449
03:13:28,010 --> 03:13:29,490
Lead on, Doki.

3450
03:13:29,770 --> 03:13:29,770
Go.

3451
03:13:30,170 --> 03:13:31,210
I'm going in.

3452
03:13:31,510 --> 03:13:32,190
I'll take the shot.

3453
03:13:32,290 --> 03:13:32,930
I got your back.

3454
03:13:32,930 --> 03:13:33,690
I take my shot.

3455
03:13:33,810 --> 03:13:34,710
You get his back.

3456
03:13:34,770 --> 03:13:35,590
I'll get his front.

3457
03:13:37,070 --> 03:13:39,650
They would not know that the princess is in the middle.

3458
03:13:40,030 --> 03:13:42,270
Actually, being in the front makes the most sense.

3459
03:13:42,410 --> 03:13:45,490
They'll be like, why the fuck is the princess in the front?

3460
03:13:46,330 --> 03:13:47,690
They'll be like scared.

3461
03:13:49,290 --> 03:13:50,710
I am the real princess.

3462
03:13:53,350 --> 03:13:54,590
Star Wars type stuff.

3463
03:13:55,270 --> 03:13:58,230
They'll assume the princess is in Newcastle or the Lifeline.

3464
03:13:58,390 --> 03:14:00,730
They won't think it's you.

3465
03:14:01,270 --> 03:14:03,450
I think the princess needs a new castle, huh?

3466
03:14:04,330 --> 03:14:07,110
Yeah, the princess is in Newcastle.

3467
03:14:07,830 --> 03:14:09,010
Oh, sorry, Mario.

3468
03:14:09,130 --> 03:14:11,030
Your princess is in Newcastle.

3469
03:14:11,050 --> 03:14:11,750
Oh my god.

3470
03:14:12,130 --> 03:14:12,870
Princess Peach.

3471
03:14:13,290 --> 03:14:14,770
Princess Peach, slow down.

3472
03:14:15,210 --> 03:14:15,870
Princess Peach, come back.

3473
03:14:15,970 --> 03:14:16,850
You're burning too fast.

3474
03:14:17,330 --> 03:14:17,690
Please.

3475
03:14:17,990 --> 03:14:21,050
Your dainty legs shouldn't be using it like that.

3476
03:14:22,130 --> 03:14:23,270
Help me, guys.

3477
03:14:25,050 --> 03:14:26,450
Someone should've come during the fight.

3478
03:14:27,750 --> 03:14:28,550
We're close.

3479
03:14:28,790 --> 03:14:29,550
I see someone.

3480
03:14:29,950 --> 03:14:31,590
You can shoot them.

3481
03:14:31,990 --> 03:14:36,710
Oh, he's so low.

3482
03:14:36,870 --> 03:14:37,310
He's so low.

3483
03:14:38,190 --> 03:14:39,430
He fucking shielded.

3484
03:14:40,330 --> 03:14:41,310
He was so low, though.

3485
03:14:42,290 --> 03:14:42,690
I'm left.

3486
03:14:43,310 --> 03:14:44,490
Oh my god, they're 10 damage, guys.

3487
03:14:45,370 --> 03:14:46,510
Oh my god, you did it, princess.

3488
03:14:46,910 --> 03:14:48,490
I think you used up too much energy.

3489
03:14:48,690 --> 03:14:49,450
You should take a break.

3490
03:14:51,210 --> 03:14:52,370
That's too much energy.

3491
03:14:53,690 --> 03:14:54,890
You gotta take a little...

3492
03:14:54,890 --> 03:14:55,910
You gotta rest up.

3493
03:14:56,530 --> 03:14:59,190
Where do we make it our home?

3494
03:15:01,410 --> 03:15:02,710
Where should our home be?

3495
03:15:03,290 --> 03:15:03,970
The home?

3496
03:15:04,110 --> 03:15:05,110
We're gonna go there right now.

3497
03:15:05,230 --> 03:15:05,930
I need my castle.

3498
03:15:06,410 --> 03:15:07,830
Yeah, we gotta get a castle for you.

3499
03:15:07,890 --> 03:15:09,170
A castle worthy for you.

3500
03:15:09,410 --> 03:15:10,130
Anything for you, princess.

3501
03:15:11,770 --> 03:15:13,530
I'm hitting the scan, guys.

3502
03:15:14,010 --> 03:15:15,030
Don't worry, I'm body blocking.

3503
03:15:16,070 --> 03:15:16,850
Thank you, thank you.

3504
03:15:17,490 --> 03:15:18,110
Don't worry.

3505
03:15:18,730 --> 03:15:19,390
It's on us!

3506
03:15:19,790 --> 03:15:22,050
Okay, okay.

3507
03:15:25,310 --> 03:15:26,650
Princess, we found your castle.

3508
03:15:27,250 --> 03:15:28,250
Yes, this is my castle.

3509
03:15:28,370 --> 03:15:29,810
Look how gorgeous it is.

3510
03:15:29,930 --> 03:15:32,050
Look at all these openings.

3511
03:15:32,410 --> 03:15:33,790
Have you seen my nail polish today?

3512
03:15:34,030 --> 03:15:36,370
Oh my god, what did you paint it as?

3513
03:15:36,470 --> 03:15:37,590
You wore gloves over it.

3514
03:15:39,330 --> 03:15:40,770
I'm slaying right now.

3515
03:15:40,890 --> 03:15:42,610
That's not a very royal color of you.

3516
03:15:42,710 --> 03:15:44,490
You guys like my new high heels?

3517
03:15:44,970 --> 03:15:45,970
Oh my god, I do.

3518
03:15:46,090 --> 03:15:47,570
They're 12 fucking inches.

3519
03:15:48,870 --> 03:15:51,230
Shit, you're compensating for something, princess.

3520
03:15:51,450 --> 03:15:51,950
Definitely need that.

3521
03:15:54,190 --> 03:15:56,170
Are you trying to say...

3522
03:15:56,690 --> 03:15:57,750
My height, dude.

3523
03:15:57,810 --> 03:15:58,230
You know what I mean?

3524
03:15:59,590 --> 03:16:01,850
I'm 4'10 on a good day with good lighting.

3525
03:16:03,010 --> 03:16:05,930
Wait, there's fighting next to us.

3526
03:16:05,990 --> 03:16:07,110
Shall I place our wall somewhere?

3527
03:16:07,690 --> 03:16:09,450
You should put your wall...

3528
03:16:09,450 --> 03:16:11,470
Honestly, right here.

3529
03:16:13,150 --> 03:16:13,890
Just put a wall down.

3530
03:16:14,030 --> 03:16:15,290
I feel a little like...

3531
03:16:15,770 --> 03:16:17,270
It's very open, princess.

3532
03:16:17,570 --> 03:16:19,350
Are you sure this is a good place to be?

3533
03:16:21,550 --> 03:16:23,890
Princess, there's a lot of open space.

3534
03:16:25,450 --> 03:16:26,410
I'm a little scared.

3535
03:16:26,550 --> 03:16:27,730
There's a team right here.

3536
03:16:28,690 --> 03:16:31,030
What is open?

3537
03:16:31,910 --> 03:16:33,310
What do you suggest?

3538
03:16:33,550 --> 03:16:34,170
I don't know.

3539
03:16:35,190 --> 03:16:38,090
I feel like zoning is going to end on us.

3540
03:16:38,450 --> 03:16:39,230
Okay, princess.

3541
03:16:39,410 --> 03:16:40,590
There's a team right here.

3542
03:16:42,050 --> 03:16:43,230
I can bomb them.

3543
03:16:43,310 --> 03:16:44,330
I'm going to open the door.

3544
03:16:44,870 --> 03:16:47,230
No, I'm still healing.

3545
03:16:48,210 --> 03:16:49,090
Princess, princess.

3546
03:16:49,270 --> 03:16:51,030
You're heading straight at them, princess.

3547
03:16:51,210 --> 03:16:51,750
Don't fight.

3548
03:16:51,910 --> 03:16:52,210
Come back.

3549
03:16:54,530 --> 03:16:55,670
Close the door.

3550
03:16:56,550 --> 03:16:57,990
I closed the door on you.

3551
03:16:58,150 --> 03:16:58,370
I'm sorry.

3552
03:16:59,710 --> 03:17:00,370
I admit it.

3553
03:17:00,570 --> 03:17:01,190
I'm sorry.

3554
03:17:01,690 --> 03:17:02,670
They're fighting us.

3555
03:17:02,890 --> 03:17:04,230
Come back to the wall.

3556
03:17:04,750 --> 03:17:05,410
Oh my god.

3557
03:17:05,490 --> 03:17:05,710
Okay.

3558
03:17:06,290 --> 03:17:07,590
This went really bad.

3559
03:17:08,130 --> 03:17:12,570
Come to me if you can.

3560
03:17:13,190 --> 03:17:14,230
Oh my god.

3561
03:17:14,230 --> 03:17:15,870
That just went really bad somehow.

3562
03:17:16,990 --> 03:17:18,550
I told you, princess.

3563
03:17:19,150 --> 03:17:20,130
I told you that was funny.

3564
03:17:20,130 --> 03:17:21,250
How did that happen?

3565
03:17:21,750 --> 03:17:22,650
Communicate to me.

3566
03:17:23,350 --> 03:17:25,170
That's what I said.

3567
03:17:26,930 --> 03:17:28,550
I thought I was the only one out there.

3568
03:17:29,170 --> 03:17:30,230
I closed the door behind me.

3569
03:17:30,250 --> 03:17:31,690
And you were out there too.

3570
03:17:35,670 --> 03:17:36,630
I'm sorry.

3571
03:17:39,110 --> 03:17:40,330
How do you fumble that?

3572
03:17:40,710 --> 03:17:40,910
Oh no.

3573
03:17:42,990 --> 03:17:44,770
Why are you out there with me?

3574
03:17:44,870 --> 03:17:45,990
Why are you guys opening the door?

3575
03:17:46,050 --> 03:17:47,030
Just close it.

3576
03:17:47,270 --> 03:17:48,330
What do you mean?

3577
03:17:50,390 --> 03:17:51,390
It's okay.

3578
03:17:51,550 --> 03:17:52,810
All good.

3579
03:17:54,190 --> 03:17:55,010
I can craft a banner.

3580
03:17:55,330 --> 03:17:56,070
Where's the craft?

3581
03:17:57,950 --> 03:17:59,050
There's no res.

3582
03:17:59,330 --> 03:18:01,710
I can get the banner thing.

3583
03:18:02,250 --> 03:18:03,590
Yeah, but how do you res?

3584
03:18:05,070 --> 03:18:06,210
How would you res?

3585
03:18:06,450 --> 03:18:07,470
You have no gun.

3586
03:18:09,250 --> 03:18:10,690
The body guy died.

3587
03:18:11,770 --> 03:18:12,650
Oh my god.

3588
03:18:12,650 --> 03:18:14,090
There's a team right in front of you.

3589
03:18:14,670 --> 03:18:16,550
You know Doki, I think we did our job.

3590
03:18:16,550 --> 03:18:18,810
Yeah, we died to protect our princess.

3591
03:18:23,030 --> 03:18:23,830
Oh jeez.

3592
03:18:23,990 --> 03:18:25,090
Oh jeez.

3593
03:18:26,890 --> 03:18:27,550
Oh man.

3594
03:18:29,790 --> 03:18:30,730
I didn't get mobi.

3595
03:18:31,730 --> 03:18:32,650
Oh, that's under support.

3596
03:18:33,870 --> 03:18:34,770
I don't fucking know.

3597
03:18:35,110 --> 03:18:37,750
There's a res beacon right next to you, but is it worth it?

3598
03:18:38,470 --> 03:18:40,230
Princess, the nation needs you.

3599
03:18:40,490 --> 03:18:41,530
Now more than ever.

3600
03:18:41,790 --> 03:18:43,150
The nation needs you, princess.

3601
03:18:44,010 --> 03:18:45,070
You must be strong.

3602
03:18:45,570 --> 03:18:46,470
I got you guys, don't worry.

3603
03:18:48,510 --> 03:18:50,310
Princess, it's all up to you.

3604
03:18:51,470 --> 03:18:52,830
You gotta repopulate.

3605
03:18:52,870 --> 03:18:53,710
I don't think there's anyone in this building.

3606
03:18:54,790 --> 03:18:56,530
You gotta repopulate the country.

3607
03:18:58,070 --> 03:18:58,710
Oh, there's people there.

3608
03:18:59,190 --> 03:18:59,950
They won't see you.

3609
03:19:00,270 --> 03:19:00,750
They won't know.

3610
03:19:00,930 --> 03:19:02,210
If you crouch next to it, they won't know.

3611
03:19:05,820 --> 03:19:06,460
Gen, you coward.

3612
03:19:06,600 --> 03:19:07,200
They won't know.

3613
03:19:08,300 --> 03:19:09,560
Just fucking crouch next to it.

3614
03:19:09,560 --> 03:19:10,820
What do you think this is?

3615
03:19:12,000 --> 03:19:12,640
Princess Gen.

3616
03:19:13,460 --> 03:19:14,340
Princess Gen.

3617
03:19:15,060 --> 03:19:17,400
The population of your country is only one.

3618
03:19:17,520 --> 03:19:18,700
You gotta figure out a way.

3619
03:19:20,400 --> 03:19:21,300
One sec, one sec.

3620
03:19:23,140 --> 03:19:24,280
You need a fucking shot.

3621
03:19:25,600 --> 03:19:26,480
There's no...

3622
03:19:27,060 --> 03:19:27,780
I can't crouch.

3623
03:19:27,860 --> 03:19:28,200
Wait, what?

3624
03:19:28,460 --> 03:19:29,620
What do you mean?

3625
03:19:29,840 --> 03:19:30,460
You're a pro player.

3626
03:19:30,460 --> 03:19:32,900
I know, but I'm saying maybe I can get mobi though.

3627
03:19:33,280 --> 03:19:34,900
Yeah man, princess, revive us.

3628
03:19:34,900 --> 03:19:35,860
I'm sticking, I'm sticking, I'm sticking.

3629
03:19:36,320 --> 03:19:39,000
Stick it, princess, repopulate the country.

3630
03:19:40,840 --> 03:19:42,500
The kingdom must live on.

3631
03:19:43,000 --> 03:19:45,120
Come this way, come this way if you can.

3632
03:19:45,400 --> 03:19:46,200
I'm trying to survive.

3633
03:19:46,840 --> 03:19:47,460
No, princess, no.

3634
03:19:49,980 --> 03:19:50,800
I'm alive.

3635
03:19:51,060 --> 03:19:52,160
Princess, I'm watching you.

3636
03:19:53,980 --> 03:19:54,980
Princess, no.

3637
03:19:55,860 --> 03:19:57,200
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive.

3638
03:19:58,800 --> 03:19:59,780
We're here, we're here.

3639
03:20:03,480 --> 03:20:04,700
Oh my god, I'm alive.

3640
03:20:05,000 --> 03:20:05,940
Help, come to me.

3641
03:20:06,520 --> 03:20:07,240
I'm trying.

3642
03:20:08,620 --> 03:20:09,520
We have to go up this corner.

3643
03:20:10,840 --> 03:20:11,720
I can't, I can't.

3644
03:20:11,860 --> 03:20:12,660
I'm helping, I'm covering.

3645
03:20:12,820 --> 03:20:14,460
I'm going to sacrifice myself for you, princess.

3646
03:20:15,220 --> 03:20:16,180
Don't, don't, don't.

3647
03:20:16,280 --> 03:20:16,900
I need you alive.

3648
03:20:17,240 --> 03:20:18,340
I'm sacrificing myself for you.

3649
03:20:20,240 --> 03:20:20,920
I'm covered.

3650
03:20:21,960 --> 03:20:23,260
Wait, I think we can go up to a restaurant.

3651
03:20:23,360 --> 03:20:25,380
No, do not come to me, princess.

3652
03:20:26,500 --> 03:20:26,900
Come to me.

3653
03:20:28,340 --> 03:20:30,020
Altair, come to me.

3654
03:20:30,120 --> 03:20:30,880
Oh god.

3655
03:20:31,100 --> 03:20:32,100
They're fighting underneath us.

3656
03:20:32,300 --> 03:20:33,820
I killed one.

3657
03:20:34,180 --> 03:20:35,100
Wait, how?

3658
03:20:35,440 --> 03:20:36,560
Back up, back up, back up.

3659
03:20:38,020 --> 03:20:40,220
Back to the restaurant, back to the fucking restaurant.

3660
03:20:40,560 --> 03:20:42,200
I'm hiding, I'm hiding on me.

3661
03:20:42,620 --> 03:20:43,560
Guys, I lived.

3662
03:20:44,260 --> 03:20:46,220
Doki, I need you here, god damn it.

3663
03:20:46,240 --> 03:20:47,100
I'm fucking coming over.

3664
03:20:48,800 --> 03:20:50,060
Get over here.

3665
03:20:50,820 --> 03:20:52,000
I gave you backup.

3666
03:20:52,740 --> 03:20:54,040
Altair, come to me.

3667
03:20:54,040 --> 03:20:55,860
All of us sit in this corner, now.

3668
03:20:57,380 --> 03:20:58,460
I'm dropping you grenades.

3669
03:20:58,600 --> 03:20:59,540
Grab all my grenades.

3670
03:20:59,940 --> 03:21:00,540
And my heals.

3671
03:21:00,700 --> 03:21:01,800
I'm grabbing all my heals.

3672
03:21:03,000 --> 03:21:04,380
We sit in this corner.

3673
03:21:04,540 --> 03:21:07,240
When you get wall, Altair, you're all towards north.

3674
03:21:07,720 --> 03:21:08,640
Yes, princess.

3675
03:21:10,160 --> 03:21:12,260
I've never seen anyone die like that before.

3676
03:21:12,360 --> 03:21:12,960
Let's go, baby.

3677
03:21:14,040 --> 03:21:15,000
Yes, princess.

3678
03:21:17,560 --> 03:21:19,000
We understand, princess.

3679
03:21:19,920 --> 03:21:20,220
Good.

3680
03:21:20,220 --> 03:21:20,640
Good.

3681
03:21:22,300 --> 03:21:23,360
Oh my god.

3682
03:21:23,720 --> 03:21:25,160
They won't know we're here.

3683
03:21:25,380 --> 03:21:25,880
They don't know.

3684
03:21:26,840 --> 03:21:29,680
If they shoot us, Altair, just put a Q down.

3685
03:21:30,360 --> 03:21:31,660
And we just sit behind it.

3686
03:21:31,960 --> 03:21:32,480
Okay, princess.

3687
03:21:34,220 --> 03:21:35,460
They're right below us.

3688
03:21:35,520 --> 03:21:36,240
I hear them, princess.

3689
03:21:38,060 --> 03:21:38,900
10 seconds.

3690
03:21:39,440 --> 03:21:40,240
10 seconds, beautiful.

3691
03:21:41,660 --> 03:21:42,420
Beautiful, beautiful.

3692
03:21:43,980 --> 03:21:46,140
This is a military princess right here.

3693
03:21:46,920 --> 03:21:49,780
Just when you get it, facing this way, right here on me.

3694
03:21:51,460 --> 03:21:52,800
I'm Q-ing the bastards.

3695
03:21:53,080 --> 03:21:55,500
Put it down, put it down.

3696
03:21:55,600 --> 03:21:57,080
Nice, beautiful, beautiful.

3697
03:21:57,580 --> 03:21:59,040
You're such a handsome man.

3698
03:21:59,980 --> 03:22:01,780
Oh my god, I might marry you.

3699
03:22:02,060 --> 03:22:02,560
Don't kill me.

3700
03:22:02,560 --> 03:22:03,120
What the fuck?

3701
03:22:16,460 --> 03:22:18,580
Don't get hit too much.

3702
03:22:18,660 --> 03:22:19,620
You can sit behind the middle.

3703
03:22:21,520 --> 03:22:22,960
You're scaring me, Doki.

3704
03:22:27,000 --> 03:22:28,500
We're gonna win this bloody game.

3705
03:22:28,640 --> 03:22:30,160
Don't take too much damage, don't die.

3706
03:22:30,160 --> 03:22:31,380
That's it.

3707
03:22:31,540 --> 03:22:32,440
Wait, I can nade them.

3708
03:22:33,600 --> 03:22:34,080
No, no, no.

3709
03:22:35,440 --> 03:22:36,460
Don't throw it.

3710
03:22:37,520 --> 03:22:38,440
It's gone.

3711
03:22:39,680 --> 03:22:41,560
I saved my grenade for you.

3712
03:22:43,640 --> 03:22:44,760
I have four more.

3713
03:22:44,900 --> 03:22:46,340
I have four more.

3714
03:22:46,520 --> 03:22:47,200
I have four more.

3715
03:22:48,720 --> 03:22:50,600
Right above us, careful.

3716
03:22:51,540 --> 03:22:53,600
Don't worry, I have so many nades.

3717
03:22:53,760 --> 03:22:54,520
It's okay.

3718
03:22:56,200 --> 03:22:57,160
Careful, northeast.

3719
03:22:59,060 --> 03:23:00,200
Right on the balcony.

3720
03:23:00,900 --> 03:23:02,760
We're okay, we're okay.

3721
03:23:06,020 --> 03:23:08,740
Oh my god, what is...

3722
03:23:08,740 --> 03:23:09,160
Wait.

3723
03:23:10,760 --> 03:23:11,600
Look good on me, good on me.

3724
03:23:12,460 --> 03:23:13,080
I'm okay.

3725
03:23:15,360 --> 03:23:16,000
Holy...

3726
03:23:16,000 --> 03:23:16,940
We just have to rat, Loki.

3727
03:23:17,600 --> 03:23:18,820
It's fine, everything is fine.

3728
03:23:18,820 --> 03:23:19,560
I have three cells, two batteries.

3729
03:23:20,180 --> 03:23:23,060
I have three cells, yeah.

3730
03:23:24,160 --> 03:23:25,440
Four syringes.

3731
03:23:25,940 --> 03:23:27,700
We have suck, it's fine.

3732
03:23:28,080 --> 03:23:28,380
Same.

3733
03:23:30,000 --> 03:23:31,640
Oh my god, I hear a rampart.

3734
03:23:31,720 --> 03:23:34,200
I don't feel so good, I hear a fucking rampart, Gen.

3735
03:23:34,660 --> 03:23:35,140
I hear...

3736
03:23:35,140 --> 03:23:36,740
Right below us, right below us.

3737
03:23:37,120 --> 03:23:37,860
Shoot this guy, shoot this guy.

3738
03:23:38,720 --> 03:23:40,120
He's one, he's one, he's one.

3739
03:23:41,020 --> 03:23:42,600
Okay, I meant to punch.

3740
03:23:42,800 --> 03:23:43,540
Can I punch?

3741
03:23:44,200 --> 03:23:45,940
You can, you can, you can.

3742
03:23:47,380 --> 03:23:49,320
You can, oh my god, he was one.

3743
03:23:49,420 --> 03:23:50,640
Replace your wall, replace your wall.

3744
03:23:51,360 --> 03:23:52,220
When you have it, I'll tell you.

3745
03:23:52,220 --> 03:23:52,680
When do you have it?

3746
03:23:54,580 --> 03:23:55,640
When do you have it?

3747
03:23:56,340 --> 03:23:57,020
I have it now.

3748
03:23:57,800 --> 03:23:59,460
Replace it, put it down, put it down again.

3749
03:24:00,420 --> 03:24:01,320
Nice, beautiful, beautiful.

3750
03:24:01,660 --> 03:24:01,760
Oh god.

3751
03:24:04,200 --> 03:24:05,060
I'm safe here.

3752
03:24:05,720 --> 03:24:07,360
I'm safe here, I have one shield cell left.

3753
03:24:10,340 --> 03:24:11,280
Oh my god.

3754
03:24:13,960 --> 03:24:15,900
I'm gonna fuse out this team when they have to come in.

3755
03:24:18,360 --> 03:24:19,280
They're breaking our wall.

3756
03:24:19,700 --> 03:24:21,240
That's fine, I can put Lifeline on.

3757
03:24:21,420 --> 03:24:22,800
We can sit in this corner, this corner is good.

3758
03:24:23,560 --> 03:24:23,980
How does it go?

3759
03:24:24,080 --> 03:24:24,360
What?

3760
03:24:26,020 --> 03:24:26,340
Umm...

3761
03:24:26,340 --> 03:24:27,220
Q, Q, Q, Q.

3762
03:24:27,340 --> 03:24:31,020
You have Q?

3763
03:24:31,160 --> 03:24:31,400
Nice.

3764
03:24:31,900 --> 03:24:32,680
Nice, that saves us.

3765
03:24:33,240 --> 03:24:35,040
They're pushing out the shields.

3766
03:24:35,120 --> 03:24:35,960
Oh, oh, oh.

3767
03:24:36,240 --> 03:24:38,380
Oh my god, kill this guy, kill this guy.

3768
03:24:39,760 --> 03:24:41,140
He's one, he's one, he's one.

3769
03:24:41,880 --> 03:24:42,860
I'm ulting, I'm ulting.

3770
03:24:43,200 --> 03:24:45,060
It's my fire, my fire, my fire.

3771
03:24:45,960 --> 03:24:47,060
Fucking hellfire right there.

3772
03:24:47,060 --> 03:24:48,780
I have no shields, I have no shields.

3773
03:24:48,800 --> 03:24:49,200
Stabilize.

3774
03:24:50,160 --> 03:24:52,460
I have one bat, I'm dropping you my bat.

3775
03:24:52,580 --> 03:24:53,720
You better pop the fuck off.

3776
03:24:53,760 --> 03:24:56,340
What is this?

3777
03:24:57,120 --> 03:24:57,520
Oh my god.

3778
03:24:58,540 --> 03:24:59,340
Uh oh.

3779
03:24:59,980 --> 03:25:01,240
We're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

3780
03:25:01,560 --> 03:25:02,800
Are we though?

3781
03:25:02,920 --> 03:25:03,880
My ult's gonna run out.

3782
03:25:04,280 --> 03:25:04,880
When's your ult?

3783
03:25:06,440 --> 03:25:07,960
My ult's gone, my ult's gone.

3784
03:25:08,040 --> 03:25:09,460
Use it to protect us there.

3785
03:25:09,860 --> 03:25:11,340
We can sit in this corner too, okay?

3786
03:25:13,080 --> 03:25:14,520
You guys are dying to the Q.

3787
03:25:15,120 --> 03:25:15,840
Yeah, I know.

3788
03:25:16,220 --> 03:25:17,640
Can't really do anything about it.

3789
03:25:17,760 --> 03:25:19,860
Come to me, come to me, come to us, come to us, come to us.

3790
03:25:20,160 --> 03:25:20,980
He's pushing, what the fuck?

3791
03:25:21,620 --> 03:25:23,180
Kill the princess, kill the princess.

3792
03:25:24,440 --> 03:25:26,580
Kill the princess, it's the Magi, it's the Magi.

3793
03:25:26,740 --> 03:25:28,160
I got one of them, but that's not the princess.

3794
03:25:28,420 --> 03:25:29,700
The Magi, the Magi, the Magi, the Magi.

3795
03:25:30,540 --> 03:25:32,300
Boost inside, boost inside.

3796
03:25:35,080 --> 03:25:36,060
About to finish you off.

3797
03:25:38,040 --> 03:25:38,360
No!

3798
03:25:40,120 --> 03:25:40,620
I'm okay.

3799
03:25:41,620 --> 03:25:42,640
I'm trying, I'm trying.

3800
03:25:42,640 --> 03:25:45,520
Run, Jen, run!

3801
03:25:45,860 --> 03:25:46,820
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

3802
03:25:46,860 --> 03:25:47,800
We failed you!

3803
03:25:48,020 --> 03:25:50,980
We sacrificed ourselves for you!

3804
03:25:51,920 --> 03:25:52,400
Survive!

3805
03:25:52,580 --> 03:25:53,220
For the kingdom!

3806
03:25:53,620 --> 03:25:55,080
I'm good, I'm good, don't worry.

3807
03:25:55,740 --> 03:25:57,120
For the kingdom, Jen!

3808
03:25:58,400 --> 03:25:59,840
For the kingdom of rats!

3809
03:26:01,140 --> 03:26:03,060
Man, maybe you should have kept the bat there.

3810
03:26:04,100 --> 03:26:05,180
Maybe I should have.

3811
03:26:05,360 --> 03:26:07,760
Yeah, maybe you should have given the bat to me.

3812
03:26:08,240 --> 03:26:10,700
You fought so valiantly, princess!

3813
03:26:10,700 --> 03:26:11,940
Oh my god.

3814
03:26:11,940 --> 03:26:13,280
Wait, does that protect you?

3815
03:26:13,840 --> 03:26:16,340
Bro, whoever's playing that bat, no way.

3816
03:26:16,740 --> 03:26:17,300
No way.

3817
03:26:19,140 --> 03:26:20,240
There's no way.

3818
03:26:20,940 --> 03:26:21,720
No way!

3819
03:26:22,000 --> 03:26:22,280
No!

3820
03:26:24,340 --> 03:26:25,460
So close!

3821
03:26:29,400 --> 03:26:30,660
Oh my god.

3822
03:26:30,680 --> 03:26:31,820
There's no way!

3823
03:26:32,120 --> 03:26:32,980
I died to that!

3824
03:26:33,900 --> 03:26:35,080
I died to ring, but I got hit.

3825
03:26:35,260 --> 03:26:37,020
No, you got hit by the TV.

3826
03:26:37,020 --> 03:26:39,320
I got hit by defensive, that's crazy.

3827
03:26:40,580 --> 03:26:41,960
Oh my god, it's TimmyC.

3828
03:26:42,100 --> 03:26:42,920
I think Timmy...

3829
03:26:42,920 --> 03:26:44,220
Oh my god, I won!

3830
03:26:44,740 --> 03:26:45,120
No!

3831
03:26:47,720 --> 03:26:48,140
Oh.

3832
03:26:49,620 --> 03:26:50,920
Oh my god, it's Timmy!

3833
03:26:51,060 --> 03:26:52,400
Your team killed...

3834
03:26:53,100 --> 03:26:54,780
Oh my god.

3835
03:26:54,800 --> 03:26:55,540
That actually kills?

3836
03:26:55,620 --> 03:26:55,900
What?

3837
03:26:56,320 --> 03:26:57,280
Oh my god.

3838
03:26:58,940 --> 03:27:00,240
Dude, that's the princess.

3839
03:27:00,440 --> 03:27:02,380
The princess is trying to live right now.

3840
03:27:02,640 --> 03:27:03,940
Look at the bat, Maggie!

3841
03:27:04,880 --> 03:27:07,160
I think SakuraC won!

3842
03:27:07,160 --> 03:27:09,400
Wait, Timmy?

3843
03:27:09,680 --> 03:27:09,940
Yeah!

3844
03:27:10,660 --> 03:27:12,060
Oh my god, the boys.

3845
03:27:12,820 --> 03:27:14,780
Bro, the princess lived!

3846
03:27:14,940 --> 03:27:17,000
The princess lived from zone!

3847
03:27:18,120 --> 03:27:19,380
That is crazy.

3848
03:27:20,360 --> 03:27:21,620
Holy shit!

3849
03:27:23,520 --> 03:27:25,940
I saw the princess live!

3850
03:27:28,220 --> 03:27:29,820
I think this was Timmy.

3851
03:27:30,540 --> 03:27:34,220
I think Timmy was the one that was harassing us with her drill.

3852
03:27:35,300 --> 03:27:36,580
With the drill the whole time...

3853
03:27:36,580 --> 03:27:37,320
I didn't do it.

3854
03:27:37,360 --> 03:27:38,400
Oh my god.

3855
03:27:38,680 --> 03:27:40,620
So my wall doesn't stop that drill.

3856
03:27:41,020 --> 03:27:42,520
No, you have to use your Q.

3857
03:27:42,700 --> 03:27:43,540
You have to use your Q.

3858
03:27:43,640 --> 03:27:45,140
Yes, I could have T1!

3859
03:27:46,340 --> 03:27:47,600
I got burned through it.

3860
03:27:48,160 --> 03:27:49,600
Oh my god.

3861
03:27:51,180 --> 03:27:52,060
That's crazy.

3862
03:27:54,000 --> 03:27:56,080
Dude, that team is pushing us like insane.

3863
03:27:58,580 --> 03:28:00,320
That was insane.

3864
03:28:00,680 --> 03:28:01,000
Alright.

3865
03:28:01,580 --> 03:28:03,000
Get back to the caster.

3866
03:28:03,140 --> 03:28:04,820
I'll see you guys in the next game.

3867
03:28:07,060 --> 03:28:08,420
Oh my god.

3868
03:28:08,460 --> 03:28:09,240
That was Saikouno.

3869
03:28:09,320 --> 03:28:10,500
That was Timmy's team.

3870
03:28:10,760 --> 03:28:12,320
Timmy's team takes the W, bro.

3871
03:28:12,440 --> 03:28:15,220
The princess lived from zone alone!

3872
03:28:16,260 --> 03:28:17,000
I don't get it.

3873
03:28:18,380 --> 03:28:21,400
He wins the most unorthodox games every time.

3874
03:28:22,000 --> 03:28:22,460
It's unreal.

3875
03:28:24,180 --> 03:28:26,100
He's always good at weird shit.

3876
03:28:27,340 --> 03:28:28,300
By the way, Doki.

3877
03:28:28,460 --> 03:28:30,820
Manish is getting only one nerf now.

3878
03:28:30,940 --> 03:28:31,580
Oh, only one?

3879
03:28:31,760 --> 03:28:32,860
No, no, no.

3880
03:28:33,340 --> 03:28:34,760
He's getting two nerfs.

3881
03:28:35,360 --> 03:28:39,000
He got to pick one out of the three to remove.

3882
03:28:39,400 --> 03:28:39,900
Oh, okay.

3883
03:28:40,160 --> 03:28:40,880
What does he mean?

3884
03:28:41,840 --> 03:28:42,940
He's only getting one now.

3885
03:28:44,740 --> 03:28:45,280
Wait, what?

3886
03:28:45,940 --> 03:28:46,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3887
03:28:47,880 --> 03:28:48,740
Don't ask why.

3888
03:28:49,780 --> 03:28:50,900
It's totally not my fault.

3889
03:28:51,000 --> 03:28:52,080
I'm going to go pee real quick.

3890
03:28:52,580 --> 03:28:54,700
We're going to leave the interview to pee?

3891
03:28:55,000 --> 03:28:56,380
I'm going to go pee real quick.

3892
03:29:00,320 --> 03:29:01,440
How's it going, man?

3893
03:29:02,600 --> 03:29:04,040
I saw your princess.

3894
03:29:04,560 --> 03:29:06,540
Your princess clutched it up.

3895
03:29:07,240 --> 03:29:07,800
Yeah, wait.

3896
03:29:08,040 --> 03:29:10,380
Okay, but I did so much right before that.

3897
03:29:10,440 --> 03:29:11,160
Did you see that part?

3898
03:29:11,340 --> 03:29:13,160
The one where you couldn't climb the wall?

3899
03:29:13,980 --> 03:29:15,160
Oh, you did see that part?

3900
03:29:16,220 --> 03:29:17,880
It was bugged, I swear.

3901
03:29:18,680 --> 03:29:21,440
There's no way I wasn't able to climb the wall.

3902
03:29:21,440 --> 03:29:23,340
It just doesn't make sense.

3903
03:29:23,520 --> 03:29:25,020
Yeah, we were like...

3904
03:29:25,020 --> 03:29:27,300
My entire team was spectating that.

3905
03:29:27,880 --> 03:29:29,590
My entire team spectated.

3906
03:29:30,600 --> 03:29:31,920
I was trying really hard to climb.

3907
03:29:32,200 --> 03:29:33,680
I was holding spacebar.

3908
03:29:33,800 --> 03:29:34,440
I was holding W.

3909
03:29:34,580 --> 03:29:35,680
I was doing everything right.

3910
03:29:35,880 --> 03:29:37,920
And it just didn't climb.

3911
03:29:38,200 --> 03:29:39,700
But it kind of worked out, you know?

3912
03:29:39,820 --> 03:29:40,840
It kind of...

3913
03:29:40,840 --> 03:29:41,800
We won.

3914
03:29:42,260 --> 03:29:43,680
Where's the rest of your team?

3915
03:29:44,300 --> 03:29:45,080
I don't know.

3916
03:29:45,160 --> 03:29:45,840
They were shy.

3917
03:29:46,180 --> 03:29:49,180
Your team doesn't want to get interviewed by Wig and Greek.

3918
03:29:49,180 --> 03:29:50,300
Can we forcibly drag them in?

3919
03:29:50,540 --> 03:29:51,780
Yeah, you can.

3920
03:29:52,800 --> 03:29:54,420
Yeah, forcibly drag them in here.

3921
03:29:54,640 --> 03:29:55,300
Sure, sure.

3922
03:29:55,560 --> 03:29:56,540
Is it your call?

3923
03:29:57,140 --> 03:29:57,800
Is it your call?

3924
03:29:57,920 --> 03:29:59,860
You want us to force them into...

3925
03:29:59,860 --> 03:30:04,220
You're going to have the guy who literally couldn't climb a wall and didn't see anything in the final match.

3926
03:30:05,780 --> 03:30:07,900
They were just like, Alright guys, climb up.

3927
03:30:07,960 --> 03:30:08,580
We're going to go.

3928
03:30:08,740 --> 03:30:10,540
And then I just... I was there.

3929
03:30:10,780 --> 03:30:11,620
I was trying really hard.

3930
03:30:11,680 --> 03:30:12,560
The guns were heavy.

3931
03:30:13,360 --> 03:30:14,940
Yeah, I force dragged them.

3932
03:30:15,060 --> 03:30:16,520
As per your order, Sykudo.

3933
03:30:16,520 --> 03:30:18,460
Hey, welcome to the interview, guys.

3934
03:30:18,520 --> 03:30:19,560
They wanted to hear everything.

3935
03:30:20,500 --> 03:30:20,840
Congratulations.

3936
03:30:21,880 --> 03:30:24,580
I got to say, unfortunately, our team cheated, actually.

3937
03:30:26,100 --> 03:30:26,900
How so?

3938
03:30:27,040 --> 03:30:28,040
Because I was the actual princess.

3939
03:30:28,400 --> 03:30:29,780
I didn't use my gun at all.

3940
03:30:30,360 --> 03:30:32,460
Thank god Timmy carried somehow.

3941
03:30:33,920 --> 03:30:35,940
I didn't use my gun at all in that ending.

3942
03:30:36,100 --> 03:30:37,140
I was just there.

3943
03:30:37,540 --> 03:30:38,560
I was just glad to be there.

3944
03:30:39,280 --> 03:30:40,340
Sykudo was the princess?

3945
03:30:41,140 --> 03:30:42,180
Yeah, I kind of was.

3946
03:30:43,280 --> 03:30:44,360
No, I didn't actually cheat.

3947
03:30:44,360 --> 03:30:45,380
That was a joke, obviously.

3948
03:30:46,020 --> 03:30:49,040
It was a joke because I died and didn't shoot.

3949
03:30:49,480 --> 03:30:50,860
It was a valid strategy, to be honest.

3950
03:30:50,960 --> 03:30:53,740
They couldn't tell who it was because people didn't shoot.

3951
03:30:54,200 --> 03:30:55,460
I say she 5-0.

3952
03:30:56,580 --> 03:30:57,880
Yeah, that was crazy.

3953
03:30:58,040 --> 03:30:59,260
I literally saw...

3954
03:30:59,260 --> 03:31:04,160
Somehow everybody died around Timmy without him doing anything.

3955
03:31:04,940 --> 03:31:05,860
He's got the aura.

3956
03:31:06,360 --> 03:31:06,640
He's Timmy.

3957
03:31:06,720 --> 03:31:07,680
He's him, you know?

3958
03:31:09,780 --> 03:31:11,920
Which was pretty insane to see.

3959
03:31:11,920 --> 03:31:12,340
Yeah.

3960
03:31:13,780 --> 03:31:14,680
Sorry, I'm back.

3961
03:31:14,840 --> 03:31:15,420
I apologize.

3962
03:31:15,800 --> 03:31:16,140
I was peeing.

3963
03:31:18,000 --> 03:31:18,800
Hi guys.

3964
03:31:19,680 --> 03:31:20,660
How'd that win feel?

3965
03:31:21,660 --> 03:31:22,840
It was so good.

3966
03:31:22,940 --> 03:31:24,480
I had no idea how we won.

3967
03:31:25,000 --> 03:31:27,180
I have no idea how you won either.

3968
03:31:27,300 --> 03:31:31,800
Bro, Timmy, you were the king at winning the most unorthodox games, I swear to god.

3969
03:31:32,060 --> 03:31:34,340
I should be dead to rights.

3970
03:31:34,780 --> 03:31:35,440
That's what I'm saying.

3971
03:31:35,860 --> 03:31:37,860
There are just so many games where you just win that.

3972
03:31:37,980 --> 03:31:39,280
It's just like a clutch gene you have.

3973
03:31:39,280 --> 03:31:40,500
It makes no sense to me.

3974
03:31:40,900 --> 03:31:41,760
It's actually phenomenal.

3975
03:31:42,000 --> 03:31:43,820
I think it's luck.

3976
03:31:44,900 --> 03:31:45,760
We'll take it, dude.

3977
03:31:46,040 --> 03:31:48,180
Also, Sykuno, I have Elim in my living room.

3978
03:31:48,220 --> 03:31:49,360
Is there anything you want me to say to him right now?

3979
03:31:49,660 --> 03:31:52,020
Oh my god, I thought you were going to bring up the climbing the wall thing again.

3980
03:31:53,200 --> 03:31:53,840
Yeah, um...

3981
03:31:57,380 --> 03:31:58,020
I mean...

3982
03:31:59,040 --> 03:31:59,820
Wait, I don't know.

3983
03:31:59,980 --> 03:32:00,840
I'm on the spot.

3984
03:32:01,080 --> 03:32:01,980
I just...

3985
03:32:02,420 --> 03:32:04,660
Ask him why he never hung out with me while he's in LA.

3986
03:32:06,220 --> 03:32:06,540
Wow.

3987
03:32:08,400 --> 03:32:10,520
He's listening on the living room TV right now.

3988
03:32:10,600 --> 03:32:11,360
He's going to hear that.

3989
03:32:11,620 --> 03:32:13,600
Honestly, Elim is pretty fake.

3990
03:32:14,260 --> 03:32:14,680
Wow.

3991
03:32:16,740 --> 03:32:17,100
Just kidding.

3992
03:32:18,320 --> 03:32:19,240
That's crazy.

3993
03:32:19,480 --> 03:32:21,840
That is crazy work, bro.

3994
03:32:22,740 --> 03:32:23,220
Dang.

3995
03:32:24,020 --> 03:32:25,600
Alright, Elim, I hope you heard that, bro.

3996
03:32:25,980 --> 03:32:26,460
He probably did.

3997
03:32:26,920 --> 03:32:27,560
We'll see how that goes.

3998
03:32:28,240 --> 03:32:28,520
Maybe.

3999
03:32:29,040 --> 03:32:30,500
We'll tell him anyway.

4000
03:32:30,780 --> 03:32:36,760
Elim called me baby and then five minutes later he walked up to another person and called them baby too.

4001
03:32:37,000 --> 03:32:37,640
I don't know how that feels.

4002
03:32:38,220 --> 03:32:38,560
Damn.

4003
03:32:40,540 --> 03:32:42,180
You know what he missed out on?

4004
03:32:42,180 --> 03:32:44,580
He just won that whole thing with no weapons.

4005
03:32:45,340 --> 03:32:45,700
That's crazy.

4006
03:32:46,760 --> 03:32:48,660
Yeah, he missed out on a Game 5 winner.

4007
03:32:49,560 --> 03:32:52,880
Alright, what's the game plan for Game 6 for y'all, man?

4008
03:32:53,000 --> 03:32:54,480
We got OG Kings Canyon.

4009
03:32:55,060 --> 03:32:56,720
Timmy, do you have any game plan for your squad?

4010
03:32:57,200 --> 03:32:59,940
I mean, it's Game 6 and you know we're known for that, so...

4011
03:33:00,780 --> 03:33:01,900
Who's picking up a wingman?

4012
03:33:01,900 --> 03:33:04,340
My game plan is that there is no game plan.

4013
03:33:08,400 --> 03:33:10,700
Apparently some teams are asking for buffs.

4014
03:33:10,960 --> 03:33:13,680
The lower tier teams.

4015
03:33:13,820 --> 03:33:15,300
What buffs do you guys want to give them?

4016
03:33:16,320 --> 03:33:20,200
No, you guys just won.

4017
03:33:24,080 --> 03:33:28,540
How do I not qualify as a low tier?

4018
03:33:28,660 --> 03:33:30,160
I couldn't climb a wall.

4019
03:33:30,160 --> 03:33:31,560
Yeah, but you have Timmy.

4020
03:33:31,600 --> 03:33:33,740
He barely balanced you out.

4021
03:33:36,260 --> 03:33:37,400
He's that bad?

4022
03:33:37,740 --> 03:33:39,160
No, I'm not saying that.

4023
03:33:42,760 --> 03:33:46,100
Timmy is like...

4024
03:33:46,100 --> 03:33:46,800
Timmy is...

4025
03:33:47,980 --> 03:33:49,600
That is crazy.

4026
03:33:51,480 --> 03:33:56,700
Alright, well, I wish you guys nothing but luck in Game 6.

4027
03:33:57,160 --> 03:33:58,360
Timmy, do your thing, man.

4028
03:33:58,360 --> 03:34:00,400
Timmy, before you go, I have a question for Timmy.

4029
03:34:00,440 --> 03:34:00,640
Hold on.

4030
03:34:01,580 --> 03:34:03,160
Thoughts on Design still being asleep?

4031
03:34:04,120 --> 03:34:05,740
Honestly, I can't blame him.

4032
03:34:05,940 --> 03:34:07,560
Because the one day...

4033
03:34:07,560 --> 03:34:09,380
I was on my team and one day I took a nap.

4034
03:34:09,480 --> 03:34:12,180
I actually went into a coma and I wasn't sure if I was going to wake up.

4035
03:34:12,460 --> 03:34:13,900
And Jen Spam called me.

4036
03:34:14,140 --> 03:34:15,440
That's a good teammate to get me up.

4037
03:34:15,820 --> 03:34:17,780
Wow, that's great.

4038
03:34:17,840 --> 03:34:19,860
He just didn't return the favor and do that back to you.

4039
03:34:19,880 --> 03:34:21,640
No, I called him too.

4040
03:34:21,720 --> 03:34:25,320
But it went to this random voicemail that I've never heard in my entire life.

4041
03:34:26,340 --> 03:34:27,220
I think...

4042
03:34:27,220 --> 03:34:29,100
Yeah, he honestly might not be sleeping.

4043
03:34:29,220 --> 03:34:29,980
He could be somewhere else.

4044
03:34:30,040 --> 03:34:30,720
I'm not too sure.

4045
03:34:32,360 --> 03:34:33,240
That's crazy.

4046
03:34:34,360 --> 03:34:34,980
Let's hope he's sleeping.

4047
03:34:35,440 --> 03:34:36,720
Yeah, we're going to hope he's sleeping.

4048
03:34:38,180 --> 03:34:38,620
100%.

4049
03:34:39,120 --> 03:34:39,900
Alright, well, GG's y'all.

4050
03:34:40,020 --> 03:34:40,420
Good luck, man.

4051
03:34:41,280 --> 03:34:41,980
Thanks, thanks.

4052
03:34:42,360 --> 03:34:46,940
I'll see you guys in like 20 minutes after we win again.

4053
03:34:49,460 --> 03:34:49,900
Damn!

4054
03:34:51,580 --> 03:34:52,020
Damn!

4055
03:34:54,200 --> 03:34:54,920
Okay, okay.

4056
03:34:55,760 --> 03:35:01,540
If I ever get a kill, I might not.

4057
03:35:02,080 --> 03:35:02,480
No, you will.

4058
03:35:02,580 --> 03:35:02,980
I believe you.

4059
03:35:03,040 --> 03:35:04,320
Now that you've said that, you're going to do it.

4060
03:35:04,640 --> 03:35:05,560
Just got to avoid the walls.

4061
03:35:06,180 --> 03:35:06,700
Avoid the walls.

4062
03:35:07,840 --> 03:35:09,160
No climbing, no climbing.

4063
03:35:10,480 --> 03:35:11,300
Alright, GG's y'all.

4064
03:35:11,400 --> 03:35:11,600
Good luck.

4065
03:35:12,480 --> 03:35:13,320
See you guys.

4066
03:35:14,200 --> 03:35:14,480
Yeah?

4067
03:35:16,640 --> 03:35:18,100
Wait, Gerard's team is only one?

4068
03:35:18,420 --> 03:35:19,000
What happened?

4069
03:35:19,000 --> 03:35:19,980
Oh, we had two people.

4070
03:35:20,160 --> 03:35:21,000
Two people DC'd.

4071
03:35:24,180 --> 03:35:25,660
What the fuck?

4072
03:35:27,120 --> 03:35:28,140
No, he's back.

4073
03:35:28,260 --> 03:35:28,720
He's back.

4074
03:35:29,020 --> 03:35:29,780
Rue's back.

4075
03:35:30,640 --> 03:35:31,380
So it's just Bullet.

4076
03:35:35,520 --> 03:35:36,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4077
03:35:37,000 --> 03:35:37,180
Yeah.

4078
03:35:38,160 --> 03:35:41,000
So, maybe we should...

4079
03:35:44,960 --> 03:35:47,000
No, we could get...

4080
03:35:47,000 --> 03:35:49,800
You ready to join Tempo, Dash?

4081
03:35:50,180 --> 03:35:50,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4082
03:35:50,760 --> 03:35:52,220
Is the third not coming back?

4083
03:35:52,900 --> 03:35:54,600
Yeah, his PC is like...

4084
03:35:54,600 --> 03:35:55,360
dead.

4085
03:35:55,980 --> 03:35:57,420
Oh my god.

4086
03:35:58,220 --> 03:35:58,880
Wow, right.

4087
03:36:00,400 --> 03:36:02,620
Tempo, you really did that to his PC, bro.

4088
03:36:02,800 --> 03:36:05,000
Yeah, Tempo, your presence literally...

4089
03:36:05,860 --> 03:36:06,960
cried his CPU.

4090
03:36:08,220 --> 03:36:09,480
Wait, what happened to Timmy?

4091
03:36:09,540 --> 03:36:10,560
Their luck is crazy.

4092
03:36:11,580 --> 03:36:12,460
No, Timmy, what do you mean?

4093
03:36:12,880 --> 03:36:13,640
Timmy's around.

4094
03:36:14,740 --> 03:36:17,240
Oh, I think he's just rejoining, I'm pretty sure.

4095
03:36:17,400 --> 03:36:18,420
Yeah, I think so.

4096
03:36:18,460 --> 03:36:19,160
Hey, Timmy's back.

4097
03:36:19,660 --> 03:36:21,780
Yeah, he's still there.

4098
03:36:22,640 --> 03:36:24,160
Yeah, Dash, you should join them.

4099
03:36:25,020 --> 03:36:25,780
Uh, okay.

4100
03:36:25,960 --> 03:36:27,220
Wait, let me just...

4101
03:36:27,220 --> 03:36:30,140
He said, I can do it alone.

4102
03:36:35,160 --> 03:36:36,160
I'd win.

4103
03:36:37,180 --> 03:36:37,940
Oh, so...

4104
03:36:37,940 --> 03:36:39,500
What kind of buffs do we...

4105
03:36:39,500 --> 03:36:43,620
They want the other teams...

4106
03:36:43,620 --> 03:36:45,740
One pro would like to have...

4107
03:36:45,740 --> 03:36:48,200
One pro slash master would have to have two guns.

4108
03:36:48,680 --> 03:36:49,540
Should we give them that?

4109
03:36:50,880 --> 03:36:51,420
Wait, what?

4110
03:36:51,540 --> 03:36:51,960
I'm confused.

4111
03:36:52,020 --> 03:36:52,580
I mean, are we trying to...

4112
03:36:52,580 --> 03:36:54,360
Lulu's asking for another gun.

4113
03:36:55,520 --> 03:36:57,340
I don't mind that.

4114
03:36:57,680 --> 03:37:01,320
I feel like you have to name all the teams that you're going to allow that for.

4115
03:37:01,600 --> 03:37:03,720
I mean, it's Lulu's team, so that's...

4116
03:37:03,720 --> 03:37:04,980
FaZe Connect's team.

4117
03:37:05,600 --> 03:37:05,820
Okay.

4118
03:37:06,360 --> 03:37:07,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4119
03:37:08,380 --> 03:37:11,860
We'll do, like, same teams from last...

4120
03:37:11,860 --> 03:37:12,960
We'll do...

4121
03:37:12,960 --> 03:37:15,480
So, like, Dash and you, Tempo, you both get to have...

4122
03:37:15,480 --> 03:37:18,620
Well, yeah, you both get to have two guns.

4123
03:37:18,960 --> 03:37:19,680
Oh, really?

4124
03:37:19,900 --> 03:37:20,160
Yeah.

4125
03:37:20,300 --> 03:37:20,980
Let's go!

4126
03:37:21,420 --> 03:37:22,620
I was going to ask.

4127
03:37:26,160 --> 03:37:27,080
Tempo, obviously.

4128
03:37:27,280 --> 03:37:28,140
What the fuck?

4129
03:37:29,580 --> 03:37:31,520
The all-new Tempo can run two guns.

4130
03:37:32,460 --> 03:37:37,200
I think you should write a written apology to Gerard that he has to have Tempo.

4131
03:37:40,980 --> 03:37:41,860
Every time!

4132
03:37:41,860 --> 03:37:44,400
I mean, he always has fun for what it seems like.

4133
03:37:44,520 --> 03:37:47,560
He's just smiling this whole time and laughing, so...

4134
03:37:48,760 --> 03:37:50,480
He don't give a fuck what place he gets.

4135
03:37:50,540 --> 03:37:51,280
He's over the vibes.

4136
03:37:52,760 --> 03:37:53,740
He's having a great time.

4137
03:37:55,020 --> 03:37:55,500
Let's see.

4138
03:37:55,640 --> 03:37:57,060
Should we let...

4139
03:37:57,060 --> 03:38:00,100
Should we buff any other teams, or should it be...

4140
03:38:00,100 --> 03:38:02,860
Armus, Fowl, ChibiDoki, and FaZe?

4141
03:38:03,540 --> 03:38:04,620
I think that's fair, right?

4142
03:38:04,640 --> 03:38:06,380
Because everyone else really, like, plays Apex pretty consistently.

4143
03:38:06,880 --> 03:38:09,140
Maybe Armus' squad you could buff.

4144
03:38:09,600 --> 03:38:10,700
I don't know how the Monster Lover's doing.

4145
03:38:12,860 --> 03:38:13,760
Armus' squad?

4146
03:38:14,160 --> 03:38:14,640
I don't even know.

4147
03:38:14,900 --> 03:38:15,800
Have they been doing well?

4148
03:38:17,920 --> 03:38:18,320
Armus...

4149
03:38:19,440 --> 03:38:19,840
Fools...

4150
03:38:21,080 --> 03:38:24,360
ChibiDoki seems like, what if we don't have Masters pros?

4151
03:38:24,820 --> 03:38:26,420
What kind of buffs can we give them?

4152
03:38:26,960 --> 03:38:27,540
I don't know.

4153
03:38:27,640 --> 03:38:29,080
There's no buff you can give.

4154
03:38:29,140 --> 03:38:30,180
You only give nerfs to people.

4155
03:38:30,540 --> 03:38:32,000
I don't know how else we can do it.

4156
03:38:32,400 --> 03:38:34,360
Armus, Fowl, FaZe, and Melee.

4157
03:38:35,400 --> 03:38:36,300
What if we...

4158
03:38:36,300 --> 03:38:38,980
If you're a Pred, we can make the...

4159
03:38:38,980 --> 03:38:40,000
The bottom 5 teams.

4160
03:38:40,920 --> 03:38:42,680
Wait, who are the current bottom 5?

4161
03:38:43,080 --> 03:38:47,220
Overall, the bottom 5 are Melee, FaZe, Fowl, Armus, and Fools.

4162
03:38:47,700 --> 03:38:49,240
Oh, but we already nerfed Madness.

4163
03:38:50,320 --> 03:38:52,360
Yeah, well maybe just give him a buff then with 2 weapons.

4164
03:38:53,240 --> 03:38:56,500
Okay, Madness can have Madness' team can have 2 guns.

4165
03:38:56,680 --> 03:38:57,100
How about that?

4166
03:39:00,240 --> 03:39:01,600
Madness can have 2 guns.

4167
03:39:01,820 --> 03:39:04,980
How about Care Package weapon for only lower teams?

4168
03:39:05,100 --> 03:39:05,500
That'd be good.

4169
03:39:05,500 --> 03:39:06,720
Oh, that's true.

4170
03:39:06,780 --> 03:39:09,940
If only those teams can get Care Package weapon.

4171
03:39:10,400 --> 03:39:10,900
Okay, great.

4172
03:39:11,360 --> 03:39:13,720
Madness can have 2 guns, but his other nerf still applies.

4173
03:39:14,840 --> 03:39:15,880
Okay, there we go.

4174
03:39:16,080 --> 03:39:16,380
Let's deal.

4175
03:39:17,020 --> 03:39:19,520
And then, what were the top ranking teams sent?

4176
03:39:19,540 --> 03:39:20,760
But we can nerf them a bit more.

4177
03:39:25,800 --> 03:39:30,280
Fowl, Yakiniku, Godgamer, and Hibernation.

4178
03:39:31,300 --> 03:39:34,080
Godgamer, and Hibernation.

4179
03:39:34,820 --> 03:39:35,840
You're pro.

4180
03:39:35,840 --> 03:39:37,660
You're also in there.

4181
03:39:37,840 --> 03:39:38,820
I'm in there?

4182
03:39:39,120 --> 03:39:39,760
But what did we do?

4183
03:39:39,920 --> 03:39:40,960
We didn't win any prizes!

4184
03:39:44,320 --> 03:39:44,880
Okay.

4185
03:39:45,080 --> 03:39:48,140
Your stats are a little inflated because of the...

4186
03:39:48,720 --> 03:39:50,440
Do we nerf our partner?

4187
03:39:50,780 --> 03:39:52,220
Okay, you're a pro player.

4188
03:39:53,120 --> 03:39:56,040
Okay, maybe we assign a specific gun to their pro player.

4189
03:39:57,600 --> 03:39:57,780
Okay.

4190
03:39:59,760 --> 03:40:04,020
This is all Season 0 guns.

4191
03:40:04,020 --> 03:40:04,700
Oh.

4192
03:40:05,520 --> 03:40:07,660
How about no wingman for pros?

4193
03:40:07,960 --> 03:40:09,140
No wingman.

4194
03:40:09,720 --> 03:40:10,360
Okay.

4195
03:40:12,920 --> 03:40:15,640
No wingman for pros.

4196
03:40:16,060 --> 03:40:17,140
Yes, yes, yes.

4197
03:40:18,820 --> 03:40:19,460
Everyone.

4198
03:40:24,040 --> 03:40:24,680
Yeah.

4199
03:40:25,040 --> 03:40:28,160
These pros are going to go crazy with the wingman.

4200
03:40:29,540 --> 03:40:32,760
You give a pro a wingman in this scenario, they're going to 3 tap everybody.

4201
03:40:32,760 --> 03:40:36,320
Unless your face connects.

4202
03:40:37,500 --> 03:40:39,480
Luzu can't have a wingman.

4203
03:40:39,880 --> 03:40:40,900
Yeah, fair, fair, fair.

4204
03:40:41,560 --> 03:40:42,060
There you go.

4205
03:40:44,460 --> 03:40:49,880
Okay, we should go to the channel, but is there a charge rifle in Season 0?

4206
03:40:50,040 --> 03:40:50,280
Or no?

4207
03:40:50,700 --> 03:40:50,940
No.

4208
03:40:52,220 --> 03:40:53,440
Oh, that's cool.

4209
03:40:56,280 --> 03:40:58,740
Alright, so what teams are this?

4210
03:40:59,780 --> 03:41:00,740
Oh, they got the buff?

4211
03:41:00,860 --> 03:41:01,940
There's no buff, I guess, really.

4212
03:41:02,000 --> 03:41:02,820
It's just nerfs for the pros.

4213
03:41:03,480 --> 03:41:05,080
Yeah, yeah, that should be good, right?

4214
03:41:05,380 --> 03:41:06,760
Is there anything else we can adjust?

4215
03:41:07,480 --> 03:41:08,940
No, you can't really buff teams more than that.

4216
03:41:09,340 --> 03:41:11,020
Alright, that's all we can adjust.

4217
03:41:11,200 --> 03:41:13,480
All the pro players are just going to be like, fuck.

4218
03:41:15,860 --> 03:41:17,620
He's fucking washed up.

4219
03:41:19,980 --> 03:41:20,700
Okay, yes.

4220
03:41:21,760 --> 03:41:22,480
Yes, yes.

4221
03:41:22,480 --> 03:41:24,200
They can have a second gun.

4222
03:41:24,920 --> 03:41:26,420
Yeah, their team is...

4223
03:41:27,480 --> 03:41:30,420
Wait, Kuro's playing at 300 ping?

4224
03:41:31,820 --> 03:41:32,860
That's crazy.

4225
03:41:33,200 --> 03:41:33,800
Alright, ggs.

4226
03:41:33,960 --> 03:41:34,380
Good luck.

4227
03:41:35,340 --> 03:41:35,660
Alright.

4228
03:41:37,800 --> 03:41:38,320
Alright.

4229
03:41:38,600 --> 03:41:38,980
Hello, you're back?

4230
03:41:39,000 --> 03:41:39,760
Hello, I'm back.

4231
03:41:39,900 --> 03:41:41,480
We were deciding nerfs and buffs.

4232
03:41:43,320 --> 03:41:44,360
We're deciding...

4233
03:41:44,360 --> 03:41:45,360
Wait, can we play Caustic?

4234
03:41:45,540 --> 03:41:46,260
We can play Caustic, right?

4235
03:41:46,320 --> 03:41:47,280
We can play Caustic, yes.

4236
03:41:47,680 --> 03:41:47,920
Okay.

4237
03:41:48,480 --> 03:41:49,640
Things on Caustic.

4238
03:41:50,160 --> 03:41:50,900
Mr. Altair.

4239
03:41:51,520 --> 03:41:53,100
You're on Powerpoint or Wraith?

4240
03:41:53,620 --> 03:41:54,560
Doki, which one do you love?

4241
03:41:55,560 --> 03:41:56,520
I can...

4242
03:41:56,520 --> 03:41:57,680
Wait, what was the comp?

4243
03:41:58,720 --> 03:41:59,820
It's OG Classic, right?

4244
03:42:00,180 --> 03:42:01,420
OG Classic, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4245
03:42:01,540 --> 03:42:02,800
Caustic, Path or Wraith?

4246
03:42:03,240 --> 03:42:04,160
Classic, Path or Wraith.

4247
03:42:04,520 --> 03:42:05,240
I call Wraith.

4248
03:42:06,260 --> 03:42:06,980
I'll play Path.

4249
03:42:07,760 --> 03:42:08,900
Alright, good luck, Altair.

4250
03:42:09,060 --> 03:42:09,780
I call Caustic.

4251
03:42:10,780 --> 03:42:11,320
You're on the Caustic.

4252
03:42:12,780 --> 03:42:17,520
Apparently, in this OG as well, Altair, the Caustic battle doesn't break.

4253
03:42:18,060 --> 03:42:19,260
It doesn't break at all.

4254
03:42:20,580 --> 03:42:22,040
Yeah, so that's why it's OP.

4255
03:42:23,280 --> 03:42:25,460
Can we run two guns that we have?

4256
03:42:25,780 --> 03:42:26,880
Or should I play Caustic?

4257
03:42:26,960 --> 03:42:27,720
I don't understand.

4258
03:42:27,960 --> 03:42:32,780
We're on Oregon's server, so how is the server like 300 ping?

4259
03:42:33,320 --> 03:42:33,780
That's crazy.

4260
03:42:33,980 --> 03:42:35,420
I've been playing 300 ping on every game.

4261
03:42:35,580 --> 03:42:38,540
Yeah, I know, but how is the... Is it Oregon?

4262
03:42:38,840 --> 03:42:40,540
Yeah, Tempo said it's Oregon.

4263
03:42:41,380 --> 03:42:43,520
It must be routing me back to New York or something.

4264
03:42:43,800 --> 03:42:45,260
Yeah, it's re-routing it.

4265
03:42:47,540 --> 03:42:48,600
It's just crazy.

4266
03:42:48,820 --> 03:42:54,040
There's no at minus Tempo fix the ping issue.

4267
03:43:00,920 --> 03:43:02,980
Fix the ping issue.

4268
03:43:07,980 --> 03:43:11,800
That sucks though, I didn't realize.

4269
03:43:15,500 --> 03:43:16,380
No.

4270
03:43:17,160 --> 03:43:19,160
No wingman.

4271
03:43:20,140 --> 03:43:21,220
No wingman.

4272
03:43:21,260 --> 03:43:21,500
What?

4273
03:43:21,620 --> 03:43:22,520
No wingman for pros.

4274
03:43:22,640 --> 03:43:24,320
Were you not looking at the server?

4275
03:43:25,480 --> 03:43:26,560
I can't use wingman?

4276
03:43:26,820 --> 03:43:27,620
No, you can't.

4277
03:43:27,920 --> 03:43:29,560
I hate you so much.

4278
03:43:29,560 --> 03:43:30,400
What do you mean?

4279
03:43:31,300 --> 03:43:32,560
I didn't decide this.

4280
03:43:34,600 --> 03:43:36,060
Greek decided this.

4281
03:43:36,740 --> 03:43:38,720
You're such a donkey, man.

4282
03:43:39,120 --> 03:43:42,220
Greek was the one that said no wingman for pros.

4283
03:43:44,840 --> 03:43:46,360
It's not my fault.

4284
03:43:49,160 --> 03:43:51,000
Ken's always trying to figure out how to cheat.

4285
03:43:52,080 --> 03:43:53,620
I'm trying to cheat, bro.

4286
03:43:57,940 --> 03:43:59,240
We're going to Slum Lakes.

4287
03:44:01,260 --> 03:44:02,200
Anand was OP.

4288
03:44:05,880 --> 03:44:07,460
Oh my god, this is OG.

4289
03:44:08,000 --> 03:44:09,040
This feels so OG.

4290
03:44:12,740 --> 03:44:14,040
Alright, what was our drop?

4291
03:44:14,060 --> 03:44:15,100
We have scan 2, W.

4292
03:44:15,300 --> 03:44:17,020
Wait, do you remember where our landmark is?

4293
03:44:17,900 --> 03:44:18,720
Slum Lakes, right?

4294
03:44:19,080 --> 03:44:20,940
We're IRS, we're slumming it up.

4295
03:44:20,940 --> 03:44:21,780
Remember the last drop?

4296
03:44:22,060 --> 03:44:22,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4297
03:44:23,940 --> 03:44:25,580
The game had scan everywhere.

4298
03:44:25,880 --> 03:44:26,960
That's crazy.

4299
03:44:28,720 --> 03:44:29,740
Our last game.

4300
03:44:35,790 --> 03:44:36,910
Hey, princess.

4301
03:44:37,890 --> 03:44:39,170
Yeah, did you enjoy being a princess?

4302
03:44:39,470 --> 03:44:39,550
I'm not a princess anymore.

4303
03:44:42,150 --> 03:44:44,370
You lived though, princess.

4304
03:44:45,930 --> 03:44:48,550
I lived, but my guards have died.

4305
03:44:48,550 --> 03:44:51,870
We did our job protecting you.

4306
03:44:52,370 --> 03:44:53,710
You were the last one standing, right?

4307
03:44:53,990 --> 03:44:55,630
Yeah, princess, you did your job.

4308
03:44:55,650 --> 03:44:56,530
That's all that matters.

4309
03:44:56,730 --> 03:44:58,190
I did my job, I did my job.

4310
03:44:58,930 --> 03:45:00,250
You lived for us.

4311
03:45:00,430 --> 03:45:02,570
Ignore that your bodyguard threw up.

4312
03:45:03,410 --> 03:45:04,330
Yeah, just one of them.

4313
03:45:04,530 --> 03:45:05,690
I did my best.

4314
03:45:07,650 --> 03:45:08,810
Throwing me under the rug.

4315
03:45:09,270 --> 03:45:09,830
It's okay.

4316
03:45:10,290 --> 03:45:11,070
I get it.

4317
03:45:12,150 --> 03:45:13,110
One gun, right?

4318
03:45:13,430 --> 03:45:14,390
One gun, yeah.

4319
03:45:14,390 --> 03:45:14,410
Yeah.

4320
03:45:15,850 --> 03:45:16,790
No, no.

4321
03:45:17,690 --> 03:45:19,090
We don't start with shield.

4322
03:45:20,610 --> 03:45:22,090
Yep, welcome to OG.

4323
03:45:22,090 --> 03:45:23,570
The backpack space was very limited.

4324
03:45:23,710 --> 03:45:25,690
Welcome to OG King's Canyon.

4325
03:45:26,870 --> 03:45:28,490
Oh my god, slumming it up.

4326
03:45:28,630 --> 03:45:29,350
Here's the...

4327
03:45:29,350 --> 03:45:30,950
Got my wingman.

4328
03:45:32,810 --> 03:45:33,590
This is it.

4329
03:45:34,050 --> 03:45:35,530
Oh, artillery pool.

4330
03:45:35,730 --> 03:45:37,510
This is very, very good for us.

4331
03:45:37,770 --> 03:45:38,230
Wait, why?

4332
03:45:38,410 --> 03:45:39,070
You smell me?

4333
03:45:39,490 --> 03:45:40,050
Because we have a zone.

4334
03:45:40,050 --> 03:45:41,210
Oh, we have a zone.

4335
03:45:43,110 --> 03:45:44,650
Whoa, did you not shower, Jen?

4336
03:45:45,930 --> 03:45:46,810
I haven't showered yet.

4337
03:45:46,890 --> 03:45:47,610
I need to.

4338
03:45:48,950 --> 03:45:49,750
Probably stinky.

4339
03:45:51,210 --> 03:45:52,270
Nothing wrong with being stinky.

4340
03:45:52,390 --> 03:45:55,310
If you're a gamer, if you're a true gamer, you gotta stink.

4341
03:45:55,830 --> 03:45:56,210
You know what I mean?

4342
03:45:56,450 --> 03:45:56,710
No.

4343
03:45:57,930 --> 03:45:58,730
Come on.

4344
03:45:58,790 --> 03:45:59,790
Ain't no way you're saying this.

4345
03:45:59,810 --> 03:46:00,530
You're a gamer too.

4346
03:46:01,050 --> 03:46:02,090
Altair's a gamer too.

4347
03:46:02,770 --> 03:46:03,910
Yeah, I'm not stinky.

4348
03:46:04,450 --> 03:46:05,750
There's nothing wrong with being stinky.

4349
03:46:05,750 --> 03:46:06,210
It's kind of awkward.

4350
03:46:06,850 --> 03:46:08,570
No, there's a lot of reasons.

4351
03:46:12,090 --> 03:46:15,370
Even if you're stinky, we won't judge you that much.

4352
03:46:15,990 --> 03:46:16,890
We'll be here for you.

4353
03:46:17,130 --> 03:46:18,330
We'll be here for you.

4354
03:46:18,950 --> 03:46:21,230
Outside, I'm not stinky.

4355
03:46:21,770 --> 03:46:23,790
But inside, you don't want to smell me.

4356
03:46:23,830 --> 03:46:25,050
My mom runs away from me, bro.

4357
03:46:25,410 --> 03:46:27,030
No, you're still stinky.

4358
03:46:27,190 --> 03:46:30,170
You just let the outside wind blow your stink away.

4359
03:46:32,090 --> 03:46:33,090
Spread it to the world.

4360
03:46:33,090 --> 03:46:34,990
Yeah, you spread it to the world.

4361
03:46:36,110 --> 03:46:37,250
I'm sorry for saying that.

4362
03:46:37,330 --> 03:46:38,610
Oh my god, there's an R9!

4363
03:46:38,730 --> 03:46:40,090
Wait, wait, wait.

4364
03:46:40,530 --> 03:46:41,850
R9's the best for us.

4365
03:46:43,310 --> 03:46:44,470
I'm not using a wingman.

4366
03:46:44,790 --> 03:46:45,910
No recoil.

4367
03:46:46,810 --> 03:46:47,990
Okay, I'm gonna use R9.

4368
03:46:48,990 --> 03:46:50,910
Altair, do you have a wingman on you?

4369
03:46:50,930 --> 03:46:51,550
Yeah, I'll be your donkeys.

4370
03:46:51,890 --> 03:46:53,670
Okay, I'm gonna give you my wingman.

4371
03:46:53,750 --> 03:46:55,210
Wingman is an incredibly strong OG.

4372
03:46:55,750 --> 03:46:56,630
It's like a mini-sniper.

4373
03:46:56,770 --> 03:46:57,890
Just think about it like that.

4374
03:46:59,430 --> 03:47:00,310
I only remember that.

4375
03:47:00,310 --> 03:47:01,850
Yeah, it's like a mini-sniper.

4376
03:47:02,170 --> 03:47:04,170
Okay, I'm gonna give you my wingman.

4377
03:47:04,290 --> 03:47:06,570
Cause like, you need it.

4378
03:47:07,650 --> 03:47:08,470
Right here you go.

4379
03:47:08,770 --> 03:47:09,590
What does that mean?

4380
03:47:10,130 --> 03:47:12,830
As in like, you can actually snipe.

4381
03:47:13,110 --> 03:47:14,050
What does that mean?

4382
03:47:14,470 --> 03:47:15,770
Oh, there's a 3x.

4383
03:47:15,950 --> 03:47:17,470
I'm gonna get a 3x too.

4384
03:47:19,090 --> 03:47:20,370
Um, I need light ammo.

4385
03:47:20,430 --> 03:47:21,070
If you guys find any.

4386
03:47:22,050 --> 03:47:22,350
Okay.

4387
03:47:23,430 --> 03:47:24,510
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

4388
03:47:25,010 --> 03:47:25,910
I'll make a zipline for you guys.

4389
03:47:25,950 --> 03:47:26,070
Come.

4390
03:47:26,810 --> 03:47:27,650
I can zipline for you, Altair.

4391
03:47:28,350 --> 03:47:29,410
We need blue armor.

4392
03:47:29,490 --> 03:47:30,090
Do you see any?

4393
03:47:31,010 --> 03:47:32,170
Sorry, thank you princess.

4394
03:47:32,810 --> 03:47:34,030
Oh my gosh.

4395
03:47:35,050 --> 03:47:35,450
Oh,

4396
03:47:40,470 --> 03:47:41,570
I hear shooting already.

4397
03:47:42,370 --> 03:47:43,330
There's a team below me.

4398
03:47:45,590 --> 03:47:46,930
I need attachments for this.

4399
03:47:49,030 --> 03:47:49,890
Oh, people were here.

4400
03:47:49,910 --> 03:47:51,190
Wait, unless you guys looted this.

4401
03:47:51,510 --> 03:47:52,610
I looted like a little bit.

4402
03:47:52,670 --> 03:47:55,250
I don't have a lot of ammo.

4403
03:47:55,410 --> 03:47:57,550
So I need to find some more stuff to loot.

4404
03:47:57,550 --> 03:47:59,490
I need a backpack.

4405
03:48:00,110 --> 03:48:02,290
You don't even have anything on you.

4406
03:48:02,670 --> 03:48:03,630
You have a gun on you.

4407
03:48:04,950 --> 03:48:05,790
Where's your gun?

4408
03:48:07,050 --> 03:48:07,590
It's on me.

4409
03:48:08,250 --> 03:48:09,810
It's not showing up on my...

4410
03:48:09,810 --> 03:48:11,090
Oh yeah, it's not showing up.

4411
03:48:12,650 --> 03:48:13,070
That's weird.

4412
03:48:14,090 --> 03:48:14,970
Oh yeah, I need it.

4413
03:48:17,710 --> 03:48:18,530
Yeah, I need that.

4414
03:48:22,430 --> 03:48:23,290
Light ammo here.

4415
03:48:23,890 --> 03:48:26,250
Oh my gosh, I forgot how much inventory space I can get.

4416
03:48:26,250 --> 03:48:28,670
Oh my gosh, there's a gold loot tick.

4417
03:48:30,130 --> 03:48:31,990
And wow, that's so dog shit.

4418
03:48:32,430 --> 03:48:33,030
What was that?

4419
03:48:33,670 --> 03:48:34,470
I'll take that.

4420
03:48:37,170 --> 03:48:39,690
Oh, I found like only two shield cells.

4421
03:48:45,070 --> 03:48:46,030
Oh, nice.

4422
03:48:46,170 --> 03:48:46,630
I need that.

4423
03:48:48,530 --> 03:48:50,030
More light ammo, that's good.

4424
03:48:50,710 --> 03:48:51,810
Set up in this building.

4425
03:48:52,170 --> 03:48:54,070
All the traps on doors and shit.

4426
03:48:54,570 --> 03:48:55,950
I'm going to go crazy.

4427
03:48:56,610 --> 03:48:57,670
Alright, here I go.

4428
03:48:57,870 --> 03:48:58,330
I'll tear it.

4429
03:48:58,430 --> 03:49:01,770
I'm not touching any doors anymore.

4430
03:49:02,010 --> 03:49:03,150
I'll tear, I'll tear.

4431
03:49:03,450 --> 03:49:04,430
What are you trying to do?

4432
03:49:04,450 --> 03:49:05,570
I've sworn off doors.

4433
03:49:06,450 --> 03:49:08,390
Oh my god.

4434
03:49:09,630 --> 03:49:11,610
I need a barrel stabilizer and I'm good.

4435
03:49:11,670 --> 03:49:15,310
Oh, I need a barrel stabilizer and a stock now though.

4436
03:49:15,910 --> 03:49:16,850
Anything in here?

4437
03:49:17,450 --> 03:49:18,570
There's a penis kit.

4438
03:49:19,690 --> 03:49:20,650
There is.

4439
03:49:22,270 --> 03:49:23,070
More light ammo.

4440
03:49:23,470 --> 03:49:25,030
But Mosin had free shots back then?

4441
03:49:25,110 --> 03:49:25,730
Oh my god.

4442
03:49:26,870 --> 03:49:28,510
That was a shitty gun back then.

4443
03:49:29,430 --> 03:49:30,350
Found a blue armor.

4444
03:49:31,250 --> 03:49:33,170
Okay, I'm going to bring an armor swap here.

4445
03:49:33,810 --> 03:49:36,810
Wait, this place is looted so I'm a little scared.

4446
03:49:36,990 --> 03:49:37,650
Wait, we have blue?

4447
03:49:37,790 --> 03:49:38,450
Yo, we're kitted.

4448
03:49:40,130 --> 03:49:40,790
Oh my god.

4449
03:49:41,810 --> 03:49:42,230
Okay.

4450
03:49:43,230 --> 03:49:45,470
There's people here in front of me.

4451
03:49:48,170 --> 03:49:48,970
Oh, oh.

4452
03:49:49,150 --> 03:49:49,970
This guy can aim.

4453
03:49:50,830 --> 03:49:52,010
Ten cells, one battery.

4454
03:49:53,110 --> 03:49:53,910
Four cells.

4455
03:49:54,250 --> 03:49:56,630
How are you finding all these cells?

4456
03:49:56,650 --> 03:49:57,250
I have three bats.

4457
03:49:57,530 --> 03:50:00,090
I don't even have a bat.

4458
03:50:00,970 --> 03:50:01,390
Here you go.

4459
03:50:02,010 --> 03:50:02,890
I'm going to loot this building.

4460
03:50:02,990 --> 03:50:03,330
I'll be back.

4461
03:50:04,150 --> 03:50:04,470
Okay.

4462
03:50:06,530 --> 03:50:07,930
I want to loot a little bit too.

4463
03:50:08,210 --> 03:50:09,090
I want to loot this area.

4464
03:50:09,830 --> 03:50:11,550
There's a full team on the other side.

4465
03:50:11,550 --> 03:50:12,730
I'm bringing the digi.

4466
03:50:12,730 --> 03:50:13,890
Oh yeah, that's good.

4467
03:50:15,290 --> 03:50:16,510
I'm just going to use the 3x.

4468
03:50:16,610 --> 03:50:17,090
Fuck this.

4469
03:50:17,390 --> 03:50:18,790
I dropped the 1x.

4470
03:50:20,810 --> 03:50:22,310
Yeah, dropping the digi for it.

4471
03:50:22,670 --> 03:50:23,510
I'll take it.

4472
03:50:24,430 --> 03:50:25,370
For the Bangalore team.

4473
03:50:25,510 --> 03:50:27,290
I saw a Bangalore team in Champions Squad, right?

4474
03:50:27,930 --> 03:50:28,230
Yeah.

4475
03:50:28,410 --> 03:50:29,250
I'm going to cook their shit.

4476
03:50:32,370 --> 03:50:33,350
Are you in the barrel stabilizer?

4477
03:50:33,690 --> 03:50:34,210
Yeah, I do.

4478
03:50:34,630 --> 03:50:36,050
Okay, I'll get it.

4479
03:50:37,650 --> 03:50:40,230
Wouldn't it be funny if Akim walks through this gate right now?

4480
03:50:40,810 --> 03:50:42,010
That would be so silly.

4481
03:50:43,770 --> 03:50:44,790
That would be so silly.

4482
03:50:45,210 --> 03:50:47,410
How many traps can I have at once?

4483
03:50:47,750 --> 03:50:48,390
Is it a three?

4484
03:50:48,550 --> 03:50:49,230
I think six.

4485
03:50:49,370 --> 03:50:50,110
Oh, it's six?

4486
03:50:50,230 --> 03:50:50,490
Okay.

4487
03:50:50,890 --> 03:50:53,110
There's a team over here against that wall.

4488
03:50:54,250 --> 03:50:55,050
Yeah, four.

4489
03:50:56,750 --> 03:50:57,930
I can put six down, I'm pretty sure.

4490
03:50:58,290 --> 03:50:58,470
Okay.

4491
03:51:05,870 --> 03:51:06,030
Oh.

4492
03:51:07,450 --> 03:51:09,110
I got shot from...

4493
03:51:09,110 --> 03:51:10,050
Where did I get shot from?

4494
03:51:10,050 --> 03:51:10,590
Here?

4495
03:51:14,230 --> 03:51:14,870
Oh.

4496
03:51:19,260 --> 03:51:20,460
Katnito down.

4497
03:51:22,600 --> 03:51:25,440
I forgot how little backpack space you get in OG.

4498
03:51:26,420 --> 03:51:27,460
Bro, I know.

4499
03:51:27,660 --> 03:51:30,680
Bring back bloody barrel stabilizer.

4500
03:51:30,760 --> 03:51:32,000
My Arnon has no recoil.

4501
03:51:32,480 --> 03:51:33,800
This is crazy activity.

4502
03:51:39,760 --> 03:51:42,100
I shouldn't waste my light ammo, but it's funny.

4503
03:51:42,500 --> 03:51:43,300
I have 300.

4504
03:51:44,240 --> 03:51:47,320
Okay, I have 157, so I can borrow from you.

4505
03:51:47,960 --> 03:51:48,840
There you go, 40.

4506
03:51:49,060 --> 03:51:50,020
So you're just going to keep spamming?

4507
03:51:50,080 --> 03:51:50,420
Go ahead.

4508
03:51:50,900 --> 03:51:51,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4509
03:51:51,300 --> 03:51:52,280
I'm going to keep spamming.

4510
03:51:54,560 --> 03:51:56,020
It's okay, you're a big boy.

4511
03:51:56,120 --> 03:51:56,820
You'll be fine.

4512
03:51:57,640 --> 03:51:58,000
Woohoo!

4513
03:52:01,910 --> 03:52:02,270
Hahaha!

4514
03:52:03,310 --> 03:52:04,510
3 XMR died.

4515
03:52:04,670 --> 03:52:05,650
It's so stupid.

4516
03:52:06,870 --> 03:52:08,130
Oh, they have a Wattson?

4517
03:52:08,190 --> 03:52:09,210
Yeah, it's not worth it now.

4518
03:52:09,370 --> 03:52:10,230
I want to use a wingman.

4519
03:52:10,590 --> 03:52:10,610
What?

4520
03:52:11,270 --> 03:52:11,790
Huh?

4521
03:52:12,310 --> 03:52:13,670
So pros aren't allowed to use wingman?

4522
03:52:13,670 --> 03:52:14,690
Yeah, pros aren't allowed.

4523
03:52:14,730 --> 03:52:15,610
Oh my god.

4524
03:52:15,870 --> 03:52:18,530
Because then they'll just farm the lobby with wingman.

4525
03:52:19,010 --> 03:52:19,510
True.

4526
03:52:20,510 --> 03:52:21,770
That is very true.

4527
03:52:23,030 --> 03:52:24,490
They'll just kill everybody.

4528
03:52:28,670 --> 03:52:29,750
Now we wait.

4529
03:52:30,310 --> 03:52:31,710
Now we are waiting.

4530
03:52:32,350 --> 03:52:33,230
Oh, there's Wattson.

4531
03:52:33,270 --> 03:52:33,790
Oh, it is.

4532
03:52:33,810 --> 03:52:35,210
It's OG, OG rank.

4533
03:52:35,750 --> 03:52:37,310
Wait, why the fuck aren't we playing Wattson?

4534
03:52:38,610 --> 03:52:39,170
Because...

4535
03:52:39,170 --> 03:52:39,770
Save our heals.

4536
03:52:40,190 --> 03:52:40,530
Easy.

4537
03:52:41,330 --> 03:52:42,290
Caustic is way better.

4538
03:52:42,470 --> 03:52:43,730
Caustic is so good.

4539
03:52:43,890 --> 03:52:46,850
I thought OG was like Wattson, Wraith, Path.

4540
03:52:48,050 --> 03:52:49,870
But Caustic farmed as well.

4541
03:52:50,270 --> 03:52:52,410
Get affected by my ultimate?

4542
03:52:53,970 --> 03:52:54,410
Yeah, didn't we?

4543
03:52:54,630 --> 03:52:57,450
Isn't the OG part where we get affected by it?

4544
03:52:58,670 --> 03:52:58,930
Do we?

4545
03:53:00,010 --> 03:53:01,690
You might get slowed.

4546
03:53:02,430 --> 03:53:05,050
The part about it is the barrels don't break.

4547
03:53:05,990 --> 03:53:06,890
That's like OP.

4548
03:53:07,610 --> 03:53:08,510
Oh, I see.

4549
03:53:08,850 --> 03:53:17,050
If we make it to endzone, I'll save a couple for endgame.

4550
03:53:17,990 --> 03:53:19,710
What do you think I'm trying to do here, Doki?

4551
03:53:19,930 --> 03:53:23,090
You think I'm not trying right here?

4552
03:53:24,750 --> 03:53:26,570
That's crazy comms by you.

4553
03:53:26,990 --> 03:53:28,050
Don't trust your teammate.

4554
03:53:28,550 --> 03:53:29,330
No, I trust him.

4555
03:53:29,510 --> 03:53:30,470
I trust my teammate.

4556
03:53:31,670 --> 03:53:32,410
No, no, no.

4557
03:53:32,410 --> 03:53:33,750
Someone clip it, please.

4558
03:53:33,870 --> 03:53:35,130
I'm going to save it to my gallery.

4559
03:53:35,770 --> 03:53:39,150
I do have a vendetta against controller players.

4560
03:53:39,290 --> 03:53:40,990
I was never secretive about that.

4561
03:53:41,250 --> 03:53:45,750
Every time I boot up Apex, I'll be like those damn controller players in my lobby.

4562
03:53:46,150 --> 03:53:46,870
That's Doki, right?

4563
03:53:47,210 --> 03:53:49,710
Why did you want me on your team then?

4564
03:53:52,790 --> 03:53:59,810
Every time I see a roller player, I look them in the eye and I was like, I can't believe you're here.

4565
03:54:02,410 --> 03:54:03,610
Look at me in the eye.

4566
03:54:03,870 --> 03:54:05,070
Yeah, I'm looking.

4567
03:54:06,450 --> 03:54:08,530
Can't believe you're here in my lobby.

4568
03:54:15,570 --> 03:54:16,150
That's right.

4569
03:54:16,270 --> 03:54:16,910
I said it.

4570
03:54:17,370 --> 03:54:19,010
Also, are you going to send me your sign controller?

4571
03:54:21,170 --> 03:54:22,790
Might as well get rid of it now.

4572
03:54:23,110 --> 03:54:23,630
Yeah, yeah.

4573
03:54:23,970 --> 03:54:25,450
Send me your sign controller.

4574
03:54:31,540 --> 03:54:33,740
Oh my gosh, the barrels are like green.

4575
03:54:34,280 --> 03:54:35,300
They're like green.

4576
03:54:40,300 --> 03:54:41,500
Yeah, shoot them.

4577
03:54:42,140 --> 03:54:42,880
One shot, killed one!

4578
03:54:43,060 --> 03:54:45,040
Okay, we're coming over, we're coming over.

4579
03:54:45,240 --> 03:54:48,660
I got the first one, good.

4580
03:54:49,440 --> 03:54:50,700
Make a portal for me.

4581
03:54:51,820 --> 03:54:52,320
Oh, sure.

4582
03:54:54,120 --> 03:54:55,580
This is a good portal.

4583
03:54:55,900 --> 03:54:58,080
We're good, we're good.

4584
03:54:58,960 --> 03:55:00,020
This guy has one gun.

4585
03:55:02,900 --> 03:55:03,860
Oh, wingman.

4586
03:55:04,020 --> 03:55:04,640
Bit scary.

4587
03:55:04,800 --> 03:55:05,940
Okay, loot this shit and go back.

4588
03:55:06,320 --> 03:55:06,860
Yeah, white armor.

4589
03:55:08,260 --> 03:55:08,940
Okay, I'm going back.

4590
03:55:10,400 --> 03:55:11,120
You can loot it.

4591
03:55:15,830 --> 03:55:16,290
Okay.

4592
03:55:16,790 --> 03:55:18,210
Doki, I found your portal.

4593
03:55:19,510 --> 03:55:21,290
I found your portal!

4594
03:55:22,150 --> 03:55:23,110
Jesus Christ!

4595
03:55:23,870 --> 03:55:24,650
What is that?

4596
03:55:25,350 --> 03:55:28,530
I wasn't going to say anything, but Jesus Christ, what is that?

4597
03:55:28,650 --> 03:55:30,610
I did say it was a great portal.

4598
03:55:30,610 --> 03:55:31,010
What is that?

4599
03:55:32,750 --> 03:55:34,870
I said it was a great portal.

4600
03:55:35,130 --> 03:55:36,030
I told you.

4601
03:55:36,570 --> 03:55:40,170
I thought it was an amazing portal.

4602
03:55:46,030 --> 03:55:47,710
It's good bait, you know?

4603
03:55:47,910 --> 03:55:49,630
If they chase after you.

4604
03:55:51,370 --> 03:55:52,070
See, look.

4605
03:55:52,150 --> 03:55:53,270
I can land in it.

4606
03:55:54,390 --> 03:55:55,230
Look, I'm here.

4607
03:55:56,610 --> 03:55:57,270
Are you still here?

4608
03:55:57,890 --> 03:55:58,650
Oh, there you are.

4609
03:55:59,430 --> 03:56:00,550
They are still here.

4610
03:56:02,090 --> 03:56:03,550
I'm just going to drop a PK inside.

4611
03:56:03,810 --> 03:56:04,070
I'll be back.

4612
03:56:05,290 --> 03:56:06,490
If I need it later.

4613
03:56:07,290 --> 03:56:09,370
They killed a team in front of me.

4614
03:56:14,800 --> 03:56:16,400
You're getting involved a little bit, Doki.

4615
03:56:16,840 --> 03:56:17,080
Yeah.

4616
03:56:17,860 --> 03:56:20,260
No, no, you stay there.

4617
03:56:20,460 --> 03:56:21,860
Just hold the building.

4618
03:56:22,520 --> 03:56:22,680
Yep.

4619
03:56:24,600 --> 03:56:27,000
They're like right here because the team died there.

4620
03:56:27,220 --> 03:56:28,460
I have 140 life, Doki.

4621
03:56:28,460 --> 03:56:29,080
What about you?

4622
03:56:29,220 --> 03:56:30,400
I have 152.

4623
03:56:30,960 --> 03:56:32,060
We're kind of low.

4624
03:56:32,720 --> 03:56:33,760
We'll be fine.

4625
03:56:33,980 --> 03:56:34,700
Are you scared?

4626
03:56:36,120 --> 03:56:36,640
I'm shaking.

4627
03:56:38,000 --> 03:56:40,300
Ever since he became a princess, you've changed.

4628
03:56:41,080 --> 03:56:42,660
I have one kill.

4629
03:56:43,140 --> 03:56:45,400
Ever since he became a princess.

4630
03:56:45,600 --> 03:56:46,440
Just one?

4631
03:56:46,520 --> 03:56:48,960
What happened to JenBurden10kills?

4632
03:56:49,180 --> 03:56:50,220
That's it, I'm running it down.

4633
03:56:50,440 --> 03:56:51,540
I'm going.

4634
03:56:52,240 --> 03:56:53,460
Let's go.

4635
03:56:53,460 --> 03:56:54,620
Altair can craft us.

4636
03:56:56,020 --> 03:56:56,460
Go.

4637
03:56:57,660 --> 03:56:59,280
Come on, Jen, go.

4638
03:57:00,940 --> 03:57:01,540
I'm so conflicted.

4639
03:57:02,420 --> 03:57:03,560
Stay there, Altair.

4640
03:57:03,800 --> 03:57:05,340
I don't trust Jen to be alive.

4641
03:57:09,500 --> 03:57:10,780
One way or another.

4642
03:57:12,160 --> 03:57:12,840
I think they just went up.

4643
03:57:13,900 --> 03:57:15,440
You can't do anything about it.

4644
03:57:18,100 --> 03:57:19,640
Someone's rezzing right next to us.

4645
03:57:20,000 --> 03:57:20,980
It's fine, you'll be fine.

4646
03:57:20,980 --> 03:57:22,540
Just pretend you're three people.

4647
03:57:23,820 --> 03:57:25,000
Pretend you're three people.

4648
03:57:25,760 --> 03:57:26,360
Come back.

4649
03:57:26,800 --> 03:57:28,440
I'm coming back.

4650
03:57:29,620 --> 03:57:30,620
Oh my god.

4651
03:57:30,800 --> 03:57:31,980
I'm coming back.

4652
03:57:33,360 --> 03:57:33,860
I'm down.

4653
03:57:34,300 --> 03:57:37,360
If they fight in this tunnel again, we come.

4654
03:57:37,600 --> 03:57:38,600
And we try to kill them together.

4655
03:57:39,360 --> 03:57:40,680
And then, Altair, you stay there.

4656
03:57:41,260 --> 03:57:42,180
Wait, how are you getting shot?

4657
03:57:42,420 --> 03:57:43,560
I think they're fighting now.

4658
03:57:45,060 --> 03:57:45,960
Let's go back.

4659
03:57:47,280 --> 03:57:48,320
We'll be fine, let's go.

4660
03:57:50,460 --> 03:57:52,060
They have a Bangalore, so we'll be fine.

4661
03:57:53,100 --> 03:57:54,340
Wait, they're fighting in front of me.

4662
03:57:54,480 --> 03:57:58,440
I have to push up.

4663
03:57:59,480 --> 03:58:00,580
They're getting pinched.

4664
03:58:00,720 --> 03:58:01,380
I'm nading this corner.

4665
03:58:03,040 --> 03:58:03,480
Grenades.

4666
03:58:04,640 --> 03:58:05,580
I'm going against orders.

4667
03:58:05,820 --> 03:58:06,200
I killed one.

4668
03:58:07,760 --> 03:58:08,520
I'm pushing up.

4669
03:58:08,860 --> 03:58:11,160
I'm pushing up.

4670
03:58:11,940 --> 03:58:12,460
I'm with you.

4671
03:58:13,220 --> 03:58:14,740
We should push this.

4672
03:58:14,940 --> 03:58:15,360
I'm zipping.

4673
03:58:15,360 --> 03:58:15,480
They're rezzing.

4674
03:58:15,720 --> 03:58:18,940
Oh, they have Wattson.

4675
03:58:20,580 --> 03:58:21,380
One knocked.

4676
03:58:21,460 --> 03:58:21,820
They're rezzing.

4677
03:58:23,800 --> 03:58:24,300
I'm pushing up.

4678
03:58:28,300 --> 03:58:28,880
Pushing up.

4679
03:58:29,120 --> 03:58:30,280
There's one on me, in this corner.

4680
03:58:30,760 --> 03:58:31,440
What the fuck?

4681
03:58:33,100 --> 03:58:33,740
I don't have ammo.

4682
03:58:34,360 --> 03:58:35,880
I need light ammo.

4683
03:58:36,480 --> 03:58:38,500
There's no light, they're not running light.

4684
03:58:38,840 --> 03:58:39,680
No one's running light.

4685
03:58:39,940 --> 03:58:41,660
Oh my god, no one's running light.

4686
03:58:41,660 --> 03:58:42,660
What the fuck is this?

4687
03:58:43,080 --> 03:58:45,340
Oh no, there's light here.

4688
03:58:46,780 --> 03:58:47,160
How much?

4689
03:58:47,900 --> 03:58:48,340
170.

4690
03:58:50,140 --> 03:58:51,400
Go back to the building.

4691
03:58:52,020 --> 03:58:53,180
Alright, that's fine.

4692
03:58:53,260 --> 03:58:54,780
This is our land.

4693
03:58:55,680 --> 03:58:57,440
They did not expect the...

4694
03:58:57,440 --> 03:58:58,000
the...

4695
03:58:58,800 --> 03:58:59,680
the pincher.

4696
03:59:02,500 --> 03:59:04,240
They're still fighting though.

4697
03:59:04,500 --> 03:59:05,260
I got purple now.

4698
03:59:05,420 --> 03:59:06,380
Wait, did they take our land?

4699
03:59:06,980 --> 03:59:07,780
No, we're fine.

4700
03:59:07,780 --> 03:59:09,560
They took our land!

4701
03:59:09,620 --> 03:59:10,640
It's fine, just stay in the tunnel.

4702
03:59:11,160 --> 03:59:12,860
If they took our land, we're good.

4703
03:59:13,060 --> 03:59:15,440
We're heading over.

4704
03:59:15,940 --> 03:59:16,660
We hold this side.

4705
03:59:18,740 --> 03:59:19,950
Oh my god, our land.

4706
03:59:24,370 --> 03:59:25,790
How much did you pay for it?

4707
03:59:26,370 --> 03:59:27,950
I inherited it.

4708
03:59:28,050 --> 03:59:29,190
They stole it from us.

4709
03:59:30,110 --> 03:59:30,530
Inherited?

4710
03:59:31,790 --> 03:59:32,210
Classy!

4711
03:59:35,630 --> 03:59:37,830
I inherited it, I didn't have to pay anything.

4712
03:59:40,270 --> 03:59:41,330
Someone res'd on the right.

4713
03:59:43,010 --> 03:59:43,810
I'm heading over.

4714
03:59:45,250 --> 03:59:46,370
Let's see where the zone's pulling.

4715
03:59:47,190 --> 03:59:48,230
We're at god spot.

4716
03:59:49,150 --> 03:59:50,930
We're going to this little house right here.

4717
03:59:51,190 --> 03:59:51,610
What do you think?

4718
03:59:51,690 --> 03:59:52,010
I'm down.

4719
03:59:54,230 --> 03:59:56,110
You get skull piercer, Altair?

4720
03:59:56,450 --> 03:59:57,910
Okay, good.

4721
03:59:58,050 --> 03:59:58,790
That's the best part.

4722
04:00:02,780 --> 04:00:03,220
That's great.

4723
04:00:03,340 --> 04:00:05,220
I didn't have to pay any taxes or anything.

4724
04:00:06,240 --> 04:00:07,580
I got a gold barrel stabilizer.

4725
04:00:08,000 --> 04:00:09,200
And I have a 3x too.

4726
04:00:09,200 --> 04:00:11,100
Same, gold easel.

4727
04:00:12,120 --> 04:00:15,420
I believe they took our land like that.

4728
04:00:15,580 --> 04:00:16,840
As if they owned it.

4729
04:00:19,000 --> 04:00:19,920
Are you sure they're there?

4730
04:00:20,220 --> 04:00:21,840
They were there, but I don't know if they're still there.

4731
04:00:23,020 --> 04:00:24,280
I don't see any of my barrels.

4732
04:00:25,740 --> 04:00:26,740
I'm zipping up, I don't hear them.

4733
04:00:27,360 --> 04:00:28,140
Oh, they might move.

4734
04:00:29,400 --> 04:00:29,920
Yeah, they moved.

4735
04:00:35,060 --> 04:00:36,760
I set up the traps again, Altair.

4736
04:00:36,760 --> 04:00:37,920
I'm looking at the tunnel.

4737
04:00:38,520 --> 04:00:39,440
We're in end zone.

4738
04:00:39,580 --> 04:00:40,540
I'm looking at the tunnel.

4739
04:00:40,940 --> 04:00:42,240
Then why did they move?

4740
04:00:42,860 --> 04:00:44,620
Why didn't they move and we're in end zone?

4741
04:00:45,260 --> 04:00:49,140
Oh, they're moving too.

4742
04:00:50,160 --> 04:00:51,860
They're moving as well.

4743
04:00:58,070 --> 04:00:59,110
Hit one 41.

4744
04:01:01,450 --> 04:01:02,950
I hit one for 10.

4745
04:01:03,410 --> 04:01:04,430
That's so cool.

4746
04:01:05,650 --> 04:01:06,690
One's hit for 90.

4747
04:01:06,690 --> 04:01:08,530
Hit one for 656.

4748
04:01:09,170 --> 04:01:09,210
Gold.

4749
04:01:09,930 --> 04:01:11,130
Well, that's a self-res.

4750
04:01:12,470 --> 04:01:14,250
Does anybody have a spare battery?

4751
04:01:15,070 --> 04:01:15,930
I got three, here you go.

4752
04:01:16,290 --> 04:01:17,830
Yeah, I had two, but I can't.

4753
04:01:23,360 --> 04:01:24,980
This is a little quiet.

4754
04:01:25,720 --> 04:01:26,340
I know.

4755
04:01:27,100 --> 04:01:30,240
Nobody wants to do anything.

4756
04:01:30,900 --> 04:01:32,140
Oh, I cracked him.

4757
04:01:34,020 --> 04:01:34,960
It's fine.

4758
04:01:35,320 --> 04:01:36,580
I have enough shields.

4759
04:01:41,920 --> 04:01:42,980
Oh, my nose.

4760
04:01:43,480 --> 04:01:45,100
Listen, let's move here.

4761
04:01:46,100 --> 04:01:47,280
Recharging my shields.

4762
04:01:49,720 --> 04:01:51,760
That portal was crazy funny though.

4763
04:01:53,120 --> 04:01:54,160
It's bait.

4764
04:01:55,040 --> 04:01:58,580
It makes them want to take it and they'll die if they take it.

4765
04:01:59,060 --> 04:02:01,280
It's like the biggest IQ play I've ever done.

4766
04:02:03,460 --> 04:02:05,420
There's a guy like right here.

4767
04:02:06,700 --> 04:02:08,840
Altair, why is your voice so ASMR bro?

4768
04:02:08,840 --> 04:02:10,940
Because he's just born like that.

4769
04:02:10,940 --> 04:02:12,160
It sounded like a podcaster.

4770
04:02:12,580 --> 04:02:13,340
For real.

4771
04:02:14,520 --> 04:02:15,600
He was born like that.

4772
04:02:15,620 --> 04:02:16,920
Welcome to the IRS podcast.

4773
04:02:18,600 --> 04:02:20,200
The IRS podcast.

4774
04:02:20,760 --> 04:02:22,080
Have you filed your taxes today?

4775
04:02:24,180 --> 04:02:25,860
Yeah, Jen, have you?

4776
04:02:26,440 --> 04:02:26,760
No.

4777
04:02:27,360 --> 04:02:28,020
I'm done.

4778
04:02:29,420 --> 04:02:30,800
I'm in somebody's site.

4779
04:02:31,880 --> 04:02:32,620
Wherever they are.

4780
04:02:33,640 --> 04:02:34,680
Someone's looking at me.

4781
04:02:35,320 --> 04:02:36,680
Who could blame them?

4782
04:02:43,020 --> 04:02:44,640
Sorry, I was fucking around.

4783
04:02:46,540 --> 04:02:48,240
I won't do that again.

4784
04:02:53,160 --> 04:03:00,120
Wait, there could be a Kraber.

4785
04:03:00,560 --> 04:03:01,800
Doki, you need to portal for this.

4786
04:03:01,800 --> 04:03:02,320
You smell me?

4787
04:03:02,860 --> 04:03:03,440
Yeah, yeah, sure.

4788
04:03:05,000 --> 04:03:06,360
You trust my portals now?

4789
04:03:07,120 --> 04:03:08,140
No, I do not.

4790
04:03:08,240 --> 04:03:08,600
Let's see.

4791
04:03:08,760 --> 04:03:09,280
I'm judging.

4792
04:03:09,980 --> 04:03:10,860
Watch this.

4793
04:03:12,400 --> 04:03:13,460
Yeah, you see that?

4794
04:03:14,240 --> 04:03:14,740
Yeah, okay.

4795
04:03:15,020 --> 04:03:17,320
That's a good one.

4796
04:03:17,980 --> 04:03:18,460
Watch this.

4797
04:03:18,460 --> 04:03:18,560
Watch this.

4798
04:03:19,020 --> 04:03:29,380
It hasn't come down yet.

4799
04:03:29,740 --> 04:03:31,680
Yeah, yeah, it works.

4800
04:03:31,760 --> 04:03:33,240
It's coming down now.

4801
04:03:35,100 --> 04:03:36,960
It's like the one that...

4802
04:03:38,340 --> 04:03:42,220
Oh, it's an L-Star!

4803
04:03:42,960 --> 04:03:43,720
Portal back!

4804
04:03:43,920 --> 04:03:44,380
Portal back!

4805
04:03:48,680 --> 04:03:50,140
Okay, I dropped an R9.

4806
04:03:51,660 --> 04:03:52,600
It has everything.

4807
04:03:52,820 --> 04:03:53,500
Here, take it, take it.

4808
04:03:54,760 --> 04:03:56,280
I have everything here.

4809
04:03:58,640 --> 04:03:59,280
From the tunnel?

4810
04:04:00,340 --> 04:04:02,180
I think it's the old one.

4811
04:04:03,960 --> 04:04:04,440
Oh, shit.

4812
04:04:05,160 --> 04:04:06,320
Don't die, don't die, don't die.

4813
04:04:06,760 --> 04:04:07,420
They might zip over.

4814
04:04:08,320 --> 04:04:09,480
They might try to zip over.

4815
04:04:09,600 --> 04:04:10,660
We can go to this building actually.

4816
04:04:11,140 --> 04:04:11,800
Anyone in this?

4817
04:04:13,500 --> 04:04:14,640
I think there's a team there, is there?

4818
04:04:15,900 --> 04:04:16,420
What is that?

4819
04:04:16,420 --> 04:04:17,180
I don't know.

4820
04:04:17,280 --> 04:04:18,060
I'm checking.

4821
04:04:18,420 --> 04:04:21,760
Yeah, there is.

4822
04:04:21,880 --> 04:04:22,680
Oh my god, he's on the door.

4823
04:04:23,700 --> 04:04:24,500
Jesus Christ.

4824
04:04:24,740 --> 04:04:26,080
He's literally on the door.

4825
04:04:26,120 --> 04:04:26,800
Okay, just hold the top.

4826
04:04:29,160 --> 04:04:30,440
They had a door.

4827
04:04:31,980 --> 04:04:33,400
Hey, we're breaking that door.

4828
04:04:34,360 --> 04:04:35,960
They had a door.

4829
04:04:37,280 --> 04:04:39,040
Okay, there's a team underneath us, alright?

4830
04:04:40,360 --> 04:04:44,580
Okay, I cannot fight for too long though.

4831
04:04:45,140 --> 04:04:46,780
I have to poke with it.

4832
04:04:46,860 --> 04:04:47,980
They're trying to find us.

4833
04:04:48,040 --> 04:04:50,420
They're nading us from the far staircase.

4834
04:04:50,800 --> 04:04:51,780
Oh, okay.

4835
04:04:53,360 --> 04:04:54,400
Altair, do you have a trap?

4836
04:04:54,540 --> 04:04:56,000
You can put a trap in this corner.

4837
04:04:57,400 --> 04:04:57,720
Yep.

4838
04:04:58,680 --> 04:04:59,060
I'm looking.

4839
04:05:00,820 --> 04:05:01,560
I'm looking here.

4840
04:05:04,460 --> 04:05:05,420
I hear them.

4841
04:05:06,060 --> 04:05:07,100
I'm going to go on the other side.

4842
04:05:08,740 --> 04:05:09,380
I'm going to try to kill one.

4843
04:05:12,160 --> 04:05:12,840
Almost cracked?

4844
04:05:13,340 --> 04:05:14,360
I'm being aimed at.

4845
04:05:15,060 --> 04:05:15,920
Oh, no, no, no.

4846
04:05:15,920 --> 04:05:16,160
Come back.

4847
04:05:16,200 --> 04:05:17,240
I see them.

4848
04:05:17,260 --> 04:05:19,140
They're right in the corner.

4849
04:05:19,380 --> 04:05:21,180
Yeah, they looked at me through the stairs.

4850
04:05:21,640 --> 04:05:22,660
They're super safe.

4851
04:05:25,200 --> 04:05:26,040
They're smart.

4852
04:05:29,800 --> 04:05:30,960
Not that smart.

4853
04:05:33,800 --> 04:05:35,140
Okay, I can't shoot anymore.

4854
04:05:35,280 --> 04:05:38,020
I have a hundred and something bullets.

4855
04:05:39,940 --> 04:05:41,020
Wait, their blood is unaltered.

4856
04:05:41,320 --> 04:05:41,880
They might push us.

4857
04:05:42,400 --> 04:05:42,840
Really?

4858
04:05:43,660 --> 04:05:44,180
No.

4859
04:05:46,360 --> 04:05:47,220
They're fighting in this building.

4860
04:05:50,060 --> 04:05:53,720
Do you have a digi?

4861
04:05:54,120 --> 04:05:54,840
I can.

4862
04:05:54,920 --> 04:05:55,280
I can portal.

4863
04:05:55,840 --> 04:05:58,440
Is it behind us?

4864
04:05:58,800 --> 04:06:00,360
No, digi behind.

4865
04:06:00,840 --> 04:06:01,640
I got it.

4866
04:06:02,420 --> 04:06:02,940
Careful.

4867
04:06:03,980 --> 04:06:05,000
Oh, shit!

4868
04:06:06,780 --> 04:06:07,300
It's two.

4869
04:06:07,520 --> 04:06:08,100
It's two.

4870
04:06:09,240 --> 04:06:10,140
It's two people.

4871
04:06:11,900 --> 04:06:12,620
Five squads.

4872
04:06:12,800 --> 04:06:13,340
We can win this.

4873
04:06:13,500 --> 04:06:14,000
I'm God.

4874
04:06:16,160 --> 04:06:17,240
I'm going to the other side.

4875
04:06:22,870 --> 04:06:23,650
Lots of teams are here.

4876
04:06:23,990 --> 04:06:33,330
Is there a team in here?

4877
04:06:33,410 --> 04:06:34,170
There's no team in here.

4878
04:06:34,670 --> 04:06:35,450
There's a team below us.

4879
04:06:35,550 --> 04:06:36,570
Oh, really?

4880
04:06:36,690 --> 04:06:37,390
I don't see them.

4881
04:06:38,130 --> 04:06:38,490
Wait.

4882
04:06:38,830 --> 04:06:39,850
It sounded like I heard someone.

4883
04:06:39,990 --> 04:06:40,610
Maybe it was you guys.

4884
04:06:40,730 --> 04:06:41,650
Your fat ass footsteps.

4885
04:06:42,730 --> 04:06:43,450
I'm Wraith.

4886
04:06:44,370 --> 04:06:45,510
Okay, my bad.

4887
04:06:46,130 --> 04:06:48,350
I have the smallest hitboxes here.

4888
04:06:48,350 --> 04:06:49,850
Set up some traps underneath here.

4889
04:06:51,570 --> 04:06:52,690
There's a red portal underneath.

4890
04:06:54,430 --> 04:06:55,170
They're making a portal.

4891
04:06:55,790 --> 04:06:55,950
Okay.

4892
04:06:56,910 --> 04:06:57,930
I'm going to look at the other side.

4893
04:06:59,450 --> 04:07:00,430
I can't poke for too long.

4894
04:07:00,930 --> 04:07:01,330
I cracked one.

4895
04:07:01,770 --> 04:07:02,390
Yeah, he's right here.

4896
04:07:03,570 --> 04:07:04,950
They all took it.

4897
04:07:05,990 --> 04:07:06,610
Cracked one.

4898
04:07:10,730 --> 04:07:11,250
Careful.

4899
04:07:11,730 --> 04:07:14,550
One took a back.

4900
04:07:15,870 --> 04:07:16,970
Yeah, they're right here.

4901
04:07:17,190 --> 04:07:18,470
I can't poke anymore.

4902
04:07:18,670 --> 04:07:20,590
I have limited ammo.

4903
04:07:24,440 --> 04:07:25,220
You can swap guns.

4904
04:07:25,780 --> 04:07:28,660
I want to keep my L-Star.

4905
04:07:29,720 --> 04:07:31,140
Yeah, the L-Star is really strong.

4906
04:07:32,040 --> 04:07:33,320
It's actually good in OG.

4907
04:07:33,320 --> 04:07:33,520
OG?

4908
04:07:33,520 --> 04:07:34,220
I don't remember.

4909
04:07:34,340 --> 04:07:35,620
Yeah, OG L-Star is crazy.

4910
04:07:36,720 --> 04:07:38,220
It's basically like an R-9, but stronger.

4911
04:07:42,630 --> 04:07:44,550
Oh, 20 flesh.

4912
04:07:44,830 --> 04:07:45,190
It's fine.

4913
04:07:45,930 --> 04:07:48,150
I'm going to make sure we don't get flanked.

4914
04:07:48,230 --> 04:07:49,650
Watch out for the team over here.

4915
04:07:51,410 --> 04:07:51,810
Yeah,

4916
04:07:55,540 --> 04:07:56,560
they're just literally right here.

4917
04:08:01,480 --> 04:08:03,820
I don't think they're going to push.

4918
04:08:03,920 --> 04:08:04,940
They're just chilling down there.

4919
04:08:06,800 --> 04:08:08,160
I can't really poke though.

4920
04:08:08,760 --> 04:08:10,300
They have 190 bullets.

4921
04:08:10,920 --> 04:08:11,680
What's your gun?

4922
04:08:11,960 --> 04:08:12,780
I have 120.

4923
04:08:13,300 --> 04:08:14,060
You can shoot these guys.

4924
04:08:14,980 --> 04:08:16,500
This is your job.

4925
04:08:16,880 --> 04:08:18,880
I'm going to make sure this team doesn't flank us.

4926
04:08:20,820 --> 04:08:21,820
Yo, chill man.

4927
04:08:30,900 --> 04:08:33,420
Oh, he saw the hole.

4928
04:08:34,940 --> 04:08:36,280
He saw the hole.

4929
04:08:36,500 --> 04:08:38,200
He knew it was a goal right there.

4930
04:08:38,900 --> 04:08:40,100
Guys, look at this.

4931
04:08:41,260 --> 04:08:41,660
Yeah?

4932
04:08:41,800 --> 04:08:43,260
I'm looking at it.

4933
04:08:43,580 --> 04:08:44,320
In the open.

4934
04:08:48,000 --> 04:08:48,980
Last two teams.

4935
04:08:50,560 --> 04:08:51,960
There's a team below us and a team far side.

4936
04:08:52,260 --> 04:08:54,000
Yeah, so there's a team right here below us.

4937
04:08:54,000 --> 04:08:55,560
Later on, we zip up to this high ground.

4938
04:08:55,720 --> 04:08:56,720
I made a zip here.

4939
04:08:58,180 --> 04:09:02,000
You have to save Caustico out there for a team or end zone.

4940
04:09:02,860 --> 04:09:03,260
Basically.

4941
04:09:04,680 --> 04:09:06,260
This team has to leave.

4942
04:09:06,400 --> 04:09:07,400
This team might shoot us.

4943
04:09:08,420 --> 04:09:09,660
Yeah, they have to leave as well.

4944
04:09:10,160 --> 04:09:11,200
They don't have Pathfinder.

4945
04:09:11,300 --> 04:09:13,020
They have Gibby, Wattson and Wraith.

4946
04:09:13,140 --> 04:09:13,940
So they don't even have height.

4947
04:09:14,740 --> 04:09:15,720
So we can definitely take the height.

4948
04:09:22,620 --> 04:09:24,320
I love OG Apex.

4949
04:09:24,780 --> 04:09:25,680
This is where I thrive.

4950
04:09:26,660 --> 04:09:28,280
I got Pred on this season.

4951
04:09:33,840 --> 04:09:36,320
If they don't have Wattson, I have several names.

4952
04:09:36,320 --> 04:09:37,800
I have two names.

4953
04:09:38,680 --> 04:09:40,120
We just have to survive on top.

4954
04:09:40,760 --> 04:09:41,920
That's basically it.

4955
04:09:42,400 --> 04:09:44,440
Probably play this side.

4956
04:09:44,680 --> 04:09:44,980
On my ping.

4957
04:09:45,540 --> 04:09:47,520
It looks like the most spacious.

4958
04:09:48,300 --> 04:09:50,340
The only issue is that they do have a Wattson.

4959
04:09:50,620 --> 04:09:55,860
We just have to play near their Wattson so we can use their ult.

4960
04:10:00,100 --> 04:10:01,460
Oh, Altair.

4961
04:10:01,820 --> 04:10:02,700
Don't do that.

4962
04:10:03,720 --> 04:10:05,940
I was just putting some gas traps.

4963
04:10:05,940 --> 04:10:06,320
Hey!

4964
04:10:08,240 --> 04:10:09,460
I will hit you off.

4965
04:10:09,540 --> 04:10:10,440
You are a new princess.

4966
04:10:12,380 --> 04:10:13,040
Wait, someone's on height?

4967
04:10:13,520 --> 04:10:16,200
No, they shot from below.

4968
04:10:18,820 --> 04:10:20,620
Make sure they don't try to flank us here.

4969
04:10:21,700 --> 04:10:22,800
I'll tell you when to zip.

4970
04:10:23,180 --> 04:10:28,080
Okay, zip now.

4971
04:10:28,440 --> 04:10:28,760
Come to me.

4972
04:10:30,400 --> 04:10:31,520
Shoot them at the bubble.

4973
04:10:32,400 --> 04:10:33,440
Come this side.

4974
04:10:33,440 --> 04:10:34,040
On me.

4975
04:10:35,520 --> 04:10:37,660
And when this bubble runs out, we shoot them.

4976
04:10:39,080 --> 04:10:41,020
I'm syringing real fast.

4977
04:10:41,920 --> 04:10:42,860
It's going to run soon.

4978
04:10:47,160 --> 04:10:48,060
Don't drop down.

4979
04:10:49,580 --> 04:10:50,920
Shoot this guy.

4980
04:10:52,860 --> 04:10:54,740
I'm going to tank this by batting.

4981
04:10:56,040 --> 04:10:56,720
Batting us.

4982
04:10:59,740 --> 04:11:00,620
I got a heal.

4983
04:11:01,140 --> 04:11:01,960
I have no heal.

4984
04:11:01,980 --> 04:11:02,680
I need bats.

4985
04:11:02,880 --> 04:11:05,640
The last two teams are going to fight.

4986
04:11:07,020 --> 04:11:08,580
I'm just tanking this.

4987
04:11:09,480 --> 04:11:10,900
That's the best fermite in the world.

4988
04:11:11,120 --> 04:11:11,740
Oh my god.

4989
04:11:12,500 --> 04:11:13,300
Do you guys have cells or anything?

4990
04:11:13,440 --> 04:11:13,820
I need heals.

4991
04:11:14,480 --> 04:11:14,860
I have nothing.

4992
04:11:16,000 --> 04:11:18,220
I have shield cells.

4993
04:11:21,280 --> 04:11:22,180
That's my last one.

4994
04:11:23,460 --> 04:11:24,420
Any bats, Altair?

4995
04:11:25,020 --> 04:11:25,220
Nope.

4996
04:11:25,900 --> 04:11:26,840
I only have medkits.

4997
04:11:26,840 --> 04:11:28,180
They have caustic ult.

4998
04:11:30,220 --> 04:11:31,160
Shoot down from here.

4999
04:11:31,240 --> 04:11:32,340
This is one guy.

5000
04:11:32,540 --> 04:11:33,080
Shoot down from here.

5001
04:11:34,900 --> 04:11:36,180
I don't have shields anymore.

5002
04:11:36,540 --> 04:11:37,040
I hit him.

5003
04:11:37,720 --> 04:11:38,300
He's armor stopping.

5004
04:11:40,920 --> 04:11:41,460
Altair, just wait.

5005
04:11:42,440 --> 04:11:43,060
What's in there?

5006
04:11:43,120 --> 04:11:43,620
Another team.

5007
04:11:44,280 --> 04:11:45,300
Ult this way.

5008
04:11:46,300 --> 04:11:46,700
Ult.

5009
04:11:48,240 --> 04:11:48,640
Afterwards.

5010
04:11:50,800 --> 04:11:51,320
I didn't use it.

5011
04:11:51,700 --> 04:11:52,540
I need light.

5012
04:11:52,540 --> 04:11:53,520
I don't.

5013
04:11:53,680 --> 04:11:54,540
I just have my...

5014
04:11:55,700 --> 04:11:56,860
We just have to put another gen down.

5015
04:11:56,960 --> 04:11:57,880
We can caustic ult these guys.

5016
04:11:59,140 --> 04:12:00,460
We have to focus this team on the left.

5017
04:12:00,740 --> 04:12:03,100
At best, I can play...

5018
04:12:03,100 --> 04:12:04,200
Oh my god.

5019
04:12:05,660 --> 04:12:06,640
Oh my god.

5020
04:12:06,740 --> 04:12:07,180
It's fine.

5021
04:12:07,320 --> 04:12:07,860
I'll just...

5022
04:12:08,480 --> 04:12:09,340
We're still in zone.

5023
04:12:10,680 --> 04:12:11,080
Sorry.

5024
04:12:13,620 --> 04:12:14,000
It's okay.

5025
04:12:14,380 --> 04:12:17,520
I can play Q and I'll play behind this rat.

5026
04:12:18,040 --> 04:12:19,120
I think I can do that.

5027
04:12:20,200 --> 04:12:21,420
I'm going to play behind this rat.

5028
04:12:23,340 --> 04:12:25,120
I'm going to zip bounce in end zone.

5029
04:12:25,400 --> 04:12:25,640
Okay.

5030
04:12:26,300 --> 04:12:27,460
The solo is going to grief them.

5031
04:12:27,960 --> 04:12:29,700
And you guys just go crazy on the left team.

5032
04:12:29,820 --> 04:12:29,940
Okay?

5033
04:12:30,340 --> 04:12:31,280
We have to drop.

5034
04:12:43,350 --> 04:12:43,910
They're still in.

5035
04:12:44,730 --> 04:12:46,210
I'm burning them.

5036
04:12:46,490 --> 04:12:47,650
Shoot the other team.

5037
04:12:49,330 --> 04:12:49,770
Crack.

5038
04:12:50,470 --> 04:12:50,890
I got one.

5039
04:12:52,170 --> 04:12:52,730
Last guy.

5040
04:12:54,630 --> 04:12:55,270
It's the wraith.

5041
04:12:57,390 --> 04:12:58,750
I got the armor swap.

5042
04:12:59,590 --> 04:13:00,750
Wait, where are they?

5043
04:13:01,670 --> 04:13:02,170
Behind.

5044
04:13:03,050 --> 04:13:03,310
Shield.

5045
04:13:04,090 --> 04:13:05,850
Let's go.

5046
04:13:06,610 --> 04:13:08,550
Oh my god.

5047
04:13:08,750 --> 04:13:09,390
I'm not going to lie.

5048
04:13:09,590 --> 04:13:11,210
Let's go.

5049
04:13:11,630 --> 04:13:14,990
It hit the corner.

5050
04:13:15,150 --> 04:13:16,050
It hit the corner.

5051
04:13:16,270 --> 04:13:16,950
I'm sorry.

5052
04:13:17,990 --> 04:13:19,590
It scares me, bro.

5053
04:13:20,250 --> 04:13:21,730
It goes...

5054
04:13:21,730 --> 04:13:23,470
It's so fast.

5055
04:13:24,630 --> 04:13:27,190
Oh my god.

5056
04:13:27,190 --> 04:13:28,610
It was so fast.

5057
04:13:29,090 --> 04:13:31,250
At least we get to stay on top.

5058
04:13:31,390 --> 04:13:32,630
That's crazy.

5059
04:13:33,150 --> 04:13:34,490
Oh my god.

5060
04:13:34,550 --> 04:13:35,490
I get to keep.

5061
04:13:36,330 --> 04:13:38,170
Oh my god.

5062
04:13:39,110 --> 04:13:40,430
This is the season where...

5063
04:13:40,430 --> 04:13:42,370
The IRS never fails.

5064
04:13:42,890 --> 04:13:45,370
This is the season where I got top 500.

5065
04:13:45,530 --> 04:13:45,890
Let's go.

5066
04:13:46,630 --> 04:13:47,770
This is the IRS.

5067
04:13:48,070 --> 04:13:49,350
We'll always get you at the end.

5068
04:13:49,890 --> 04:13:51,010
The IRS will always get you.

5069
04:13:51,510 --> 04:13:53,350
We'll always get you.

5070
04:13:54,030 --> 04:13:54,390
Alright.

5071
04:13:54,390 --> 04:13:56,050
Let's get interviewed, guys.

5072
04:13:56,110 --> 04:13:57,070
Let's all go in.

5073
04:14:00,290 --> 04:14:01,210
Hey, guys.

5074
04:14:02,310 --> 04:14:03,150
Is this rigged?

5075
04:14:03,310 --> 04:14:05,390
What do you mean?

5076
04:14:06,790 --> 04:14:07,570
It's rigged.

5077
04:14:07,590 --> 04:14:09,150
This is my season.

5078
04:14:10,030 --> 04:14:11,990
A fairy tale ending for a princess.

5079
04:14:12,570 --> 04:14:14,770
I know Doki told Tempa to put the zone right there.

5080
04:14:15,230 --> 04:14:16,410
I heard about it.

5081
04:14:16,410 --> 04:14:18,490
I was like, this is where the zone is going to end, guys.

5082
04:14:19,050 --> 04:14:20,230
We got to stay here.

5083
04:14:20,530 --> 04:14:22,030
We got to stay here.

5084
04:14:22,030 --> 04:14:23,510
Dude, that was so fun.

5085
04:14:23,570 --> 04:14:25,250
The end game was perfect for y'all, man.

5086
04:14:25,450 --> 04:14:26,350
Actually perfect.

5087
04:14:27,610 --> 04:14:29,290
Regis just scared me with that costume.

5088
04:14:29,610 --> 04:14:37,530
I tried to be as precise as possible for my teammates.

5089
04:14:37,730 --> 04:14:39,410
Because I wanted to win that badly.

5090
04:14:39,890 --> 04:14:40,870
And yet my hubris.

5091
04:14:41,090 --> 04:14:43,370
My hubris and my bravado.

5092
04:14:44,310 --> 04:14:44,730
I'm sorry.

5093
04:14:44,850 --> 04:14:45,170
I'm sorry.

5094
04:14:45,290 --> 04:14:45,610
I threw.

5095
04:14:47,510 --> 04:14:49,350
You did great, Altair.

5096
04:14:49,350 --> 04:14:51,390
Your canisters were great.

5097
04:14:51,810 --> 04:14:53,270
You did fantastic, brother.

5098
04:14:54,170 --> 04:14:55,410
Dude, I was like, oh my god.

5099
04:14:55,450 --> 04:14:57,310
Save this after the bubble runs out.

5100
04:14:58,130 --> 04:14:59,530
I'm like, wait, what?

5101
04:15:02,070 --> 04:15:03,590
You literally looked across.

5102
04:15:03,670 --> 04:15:05,150
You're like, no, there's no way.

5103
04:15:05,310 --> 04:15:05,790
That's what you said.

5104
04:15:05,870 --> 04:15:06,590
You're like, there's no way.

5105
04:15:09,850 --> 04:15:12,690
The important thing is, nobody saw, right?

5106
04:15:13,110 --> 04:15:13,930
I didn't see that.

5107
04:15:14,230 --> 04:15:15,670
Don't worry.

5108
04:15:15,670 --> 04:15:17,050
I've never seen that.

5109
04:15:17,630 --> 04:15:19,110
No one's watching my shit.

5110
04:15:19,190 --> 04:15:19,690
You're good, bro.

5111
04:15:19,690 --> 04:15:20,430
No, no.

5112
04:15:20,450 --> 04:15:21,070
Of course not.

5113
04:15:21,350 --> 04:15:22,190
We should do more of this.

5114
04:15:22,290 --> 04:15:22,590
No cap.

5115
04:15:23,450 --> 04:15:24,590
Yeah, that's fun.

5116
04:15:25,090 --> 04:15:27,810
Definitely we learned a lot about balancing wise, too.

5117
04:15:27,950 --> 04:15:29,170
Regarding other teams.

5118
04:15:29,570 --> 04:15:31,770
Definitely learned a lot from my very first custom.

5119
04:15:31,790 --> 04:15:33,370
Did you guys enjoy my first custom?

5120
04:15:34,450 --> 04:15:34,810
Yes.

5121
04:15:36,090 --> 04:15:37,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5122
04:15:37,830 --> 04:15:39,210
What do you mean, yeah, yeah, yeah?

5123
04:15:40,090 --> 04:15:41,930
I didn't know if you were asking me or your chat.

5124
04:15:42,450 --> 04:15:43,990
No, I'm asking you guys.

5125
04:15:43,990 --> 04:15:45,030
Yes, the cast is.

5126
04:15:45,170 --> 04:15:46,470
Have fun casting this.

5127
04:15:46,770 --> 04:15:47,350
Oh, absolutely.

5128
04:15:47,730 --> 04:15:48,270
What the fuck?

5129
04:15:48,310 --> 04:15:49,590
Yeah, I'd watch a thousand more of these.

5130
04:15:49,630 --> 04:15:50,030
Are you kidding me?

5131
04:15:51,330 --> 04:15:53,050
Which one was the most fun game mode, though?

5132
04:15:53,330 --> 04:15:54,670
Or map, in your guys' opinion?

5133
04:15:55,090 --> 04:15:56,390
What about for you guys, playing wise?

5134
04:15:56,410 --> 04:15:56,790
What do you think?

5135
04:15:57,330 --> 04:15:59,370
I think hide and seek was the best one.

5136
04:15:59,790 --> 04:16:00,310
Yeah, that's fair.

5137
04:16:00,970 --> 04:16:03,990
I think watching wise...

5138
04:16:04,910 --> 04:16:05,450
I don't know.

5139
04:16:05,450 --> 04:16:05,990
Mine was protect the princess.

5140
04:16:08,470 --> 04:16:10,250
Protect the princess was really good in the punching.

5141
04:16:10,430 --> 04:16:11,170
Yeah, I'm with dash.

5142
04:16:11,170 --> 04:16:12,830
I think the punching one was really good, for sure.

5143
04:16:13,330 --> 04:16:15,230
But this one was unique, in my opinion.

5144
04:16:15,710 --> 04:16:16,310
Yeah, it was.

5145
04:16:17,290 --> 04:16:22,690
Yeah, I also thought that people were not really gonna stick with the actual game plan, and they lowkey did.

5146
04:16:22,770 --> 04:16:25,210
I thought people were gonna 100% just not stick to the rules.

5147
04:16:25,770 --> 04:16:26,350
And everyone did.

5148
04:16:26,510 --> 04:16:26,910
It was really fun.

5149
04:16:27,410 --> 04:16:27,630
Good time.

5150
04:16:29,810 --> 04:16:30,610
Thank you.

5151
04:16:30,730 --> 04:16:36,010
There's definitely a lot of stuff I could improve on for it, but I do hope a lot of people have fun.

5152
04:16:36,310 --> 04:16:37,290
That's all I want.

5153
04:16:37,690 --> 04:16:42,450
Also, Wig, would you like to talk to your number one biggest fan that's in this custom right now?

5154
04:16:49,630 --> 04:16:53,150
I asked him to come in.

5155
04:16:53,230 --> 04:16:56,490
Also, Tempo, do you tell them that it's over?

5156
04:17:05,070 --> 04:17:07,330
Who took the W in the whole thing?

5157
04:17:07,330 --> 04:17:08,410
Was that counted for, or no?

5158
04:17:08,530 --> 04:17:10,990
No, it was more so individual games.

5159
04:17:11,150 --> 04:17:11,470
Gotcha.

5160
04:17:11,910 --> 04:17:13,570
I was curious if those were two things.

5161
04:17:14,630 --> 04:17:15,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5162
04:17:16,190 --> 04:17:16,630
Hi!

5163
04:17:17,230 --> 04:17:17,430
Hi!

5164
04:17:20,710 --> 04:17:21,670
GG, guys!

5165
04:17:23,050 --> 04:17:23,490
GG!

5166
04:17:24,030 --> 04:17:24,350
GG!

5167
04:17:26,530 --> 04:17:27,810
RPR, how we feeling, bud?

5168
04:17:29,450 --> 04:17:30,750
Good, I had fun, man.

5169
04:17:31,390 --> 04:17:31,670
Yeah?

5170
04:17:31,830 --> 04:17:32,350
Had a good time?

5171
04:17:32,890 --> 04:17:36,270
Yeah, we got a bunch of kills all the time.

5172
04:17:36,790 --> 04:17:38,930
Dude, every game, y'all were low-key killing.

5173
04:17:39,010 --> 04:17:42,050
I couldn't believe you guys survived that last reset in the last game.

5174
04:17:42,150 --> 04:17:42,930
That was crazy work.

5175
04:17:44,050 --> 04:17:44,450
Yeah!

5176
04:17:45,570 --> 04:17:46,610
Dude, Tuna snapped.

5177
04:17:46,750 --> 04:17:47,750
That was fucking crazy.

5178
04:17:59,190 --> 04:18:00,970
Thank you, thank you!

5179
04:18:02,010 --> 04:18:04,070
Are you breakfast?

5180
04:18:04,070 --> 04:18:06,290
Stop it, stop it.

5181
04:18:06,910 --> 04:18:07,890
I'm lunch, okay?

5182
04:18:08,750 --> 04:18:10,390
No, no, no, no, no.

5183
04:18:13,930 --> 04:18:14,770
Lunch is crazy.

5184
04:18:15,810 --> 04:18:18,210
She's going to eat lunch.

5185
04:18:18,670 --> 04:18:19,450
Eat lunch.

5186
04:18:19,790 --> 04:18:21,050
She's gonna eat lunch.

5187
04:18:23,570 --> 04:18:24,830
What's for lunch?

5188
04:18:25,010 --> 04:18:25,550
What's for lunch?

5189
04:18:27,270 --> 04:18:28,030
Lunch...

5190
04:18:28,030 --> 04:18:29,470
Onigiri.

5191
04:18:29,470 --> 04:18:30,350
Oh!

5192
04:18:32,310 --> 04:18:32,790
Fuck!

5193
04:18:33,290 --> 04:18:35,170
I want that shit so bad.

5194
04:18:35,410 --> 04:18:37,830
I mean, you're gonna be in Japan soon.

5195
04:18:38,070 --> 04:18:39,650
Oh my god, wait.

5196
04:18:40,950 --> 04:18:41,790
You're coming, right?

5197
04:18:41,850 --> 04:18:42,550
Rig, of course.

5198
04:18:42,890 --> 04:18:44,190
He's fucking casting!

5199
04:18:47,350 --> 04:18:49,570
It's my first time meeting you, I think, right?

5200
04:18:50,190 --> 04:18:51,450
Oh my god, wait.

5201
04:18:51,510 --> 04:18:52,830
This is gonna be our first time meeting.

5202
04:18:53,210 --> 04:18:54,590
Yeah, it is.

5203
04:18:55,010 --> 04:18:56,690
That is crazy.

5204
04:18:56,690 --> 04:18:57,730
That is crazy.

5205
04:18:57,730 --> 04:18:58,910
You gonna hang out with me?

5206
04:18:59,030 --> 04:19:00,110
Yeah, of course.

5207
04:19:01,730 --> 04:19:02,890
RPR, you gonna hang out with me?

5208
04:19:03,890 --> 04:19:05,990
I'm gonna kiss you in your big mouth.

5209
04:19:08,830 --> 04:19:10,050
What about me, dad?

5210
04:19:10,770 --> 04:19:11,930
What the fuck?

5211
04:19:13,110 --> 04:19:14,050
What the fuck?

5212
04:19:14,730 --> 04:19:17,190
That's the team chemistry we see in BLGS, huh?

5213
04:19:17,210 --> 04:19:17,710
That's crazy.

5214
04:19:19,670 --> 04:19:20,510
Wait, what?

5215
04:19:20,710 --> 04:19:21,310
Excuse me?

5216
04:19:22,490 --> 04:19:23,770
That's the chemistry we see.

5217
04:19:23,770 --> 04:19:25,610
That's what his tournament is called.

5218
04:19:25,710 --> 04:19:28,390
His tournament is called BLGS Boy Love Global Series.

5219
04:19:28,950 --> 04:19:31,870
Yeah, we support that shit, obviously.

5220
04:19:31,990 --> 04:19:32,190
Hello?

5221
04:19:34,610 --> 04:19:35,950
That's the whole point of it.

5222
04:19:36,270 --> 04:19:38,150
Express your love with your boys.

5223
04:19:41,890 --> 04:19:44,110
I saw you at the Apex Asia Festival.

5224
04:19:44,330 --> 04:19:45,730
Wait, did you not go to that?

5225
04:19:46,010 --> 04:19:47,570
Nah, I couldn't.

5226
04:19:47,710 --> 04:19:49,370
No visa, man.

5227
04:19:49,970 --> 04:19:52,410
Are Quna and QP potentially going to that?

5228
04:19:52,410 --> 04:19:53,030
For now.

5229
04:19:56,140 --> 04:19:57,330
I don't think they can.

5230
04:20:03,590 --> 04:20:05,770
It's gonna happen.

5231
04:20:06,750 --> 04:20:09,750
Are QP and Tsuna going to the Sapporo tournament?

5232
04:20:11,430 --> 04:20:12,170
Maybe.

5233
04:20:12,910 --> 04:20:14,410
I want to go.

5234
04:20:14,750 --> 04:20:15,710
He wants to.

5235
04:20:15,770 --> 04:20:16,230
I do.

5236
04:20:16,450 --> 04:20:16,990
Watch party.

5237
04:20:16,990 --> 04:20:17,490
He wants to.

5238
04:20:17,750 --> 04:20:19,710
Watch party, okay.

5239
04:20:20,250 --> 04:20:21,130
We'll watch.

5240
04:20:21,770 --> 04:20:22,270
We'll watch.

5241
04:20:23,890 --> 04:20:24,370
Yeah.

5242
04:20:25,670 --> 04:20:26,390
I am.

5243
04:20:31,870 --> 04:20:33,270
QP, do you have fun?

5244
04:20:33,610 --> 04:20:39,430
Potentially, when the Nice Wave streams, like B-stream or anything, Shima wants to collab or anything with it?

5245
04:20:39,570 --> 04:20:39,810
Yeah.

5246
04:20:40,370 --> 04:20:41,030
That would be cool.

5247
04:20:41,750 --> 04:20:42,590
Yeah, online.

5248
04:20:43,370 --> 04:20:43,930
Collab?

5249
04:20:44,210 --> 04:20:44,770
Collab?

5250
04:20:45,590 --> 04:20:46,210
B-stream?

5251
04:20:47,130 --> 04:20:48,970
Yeah, B-stream collab with QP.

5252
04:20:49,050 --> 04:20:49,390
I'm down.

5253
04:20:50,730 --> 04:20:51,350
What the fuck?

5254
04:20:51,450 --> 04:20:53,010
I asked you for a B-stream collab.

5255
04:20:53,070 --> 04:20:54,550
You never gave it to me.

5256
04:20:54,790 --> 04:20:55,350
Oh, shit.

5257
04:20:55,650 --> 04:20:57,970
Oh, shit.

5258
04:20:58,350 --> 04:21:00,510
You are not Kaminari QP.

5259
04:21:00,950 --> 04:21:02,050
Oh, shit.

5260
04:21:02,590 --> 04:21:04,450
QP is not mean to me, bro.

5261
04:21:07,570 --> 04:21:13,170
Has QP ever mentioned how washed I am every 20 seconds in a ranked session?

5262
04:21:16,470 --> 04:21:20,310
Has QP ever called me out in front of 100,000 people?

5263
04:21:21,050 --> 04:21:21,930
Oh, my God.

5264
04:21:24,690 --> 04:21:26,410
I'm foaming a lot today, bro.

5265
04:21:26,510 --> 04:21:27,510
I'm getting drenched out here.

5266
04:21:29,870 --> 04:21:32,230
I've dug myself in so many holes tonight.

5267
04:21:32,310 --> 04:21:33,090
It's unbelievable, dude.

5268
04:21:33,410 --> 04:21:35,290
I got yelled at by the Catalyst voice actor.

5269
04:21:35,630 --> 04:21:37,730
I'm getting robbed out here.

5270
04:21:37,730 --> 04:21:39,450
Are you talking to me?

5271
04:21:39,750 --> 04:21:41,910
No, I don't shit talk to you ever, man.

5272
04:21:43,770 --> 04:21:47,450
RPR, I shit talk to you to make myself feel better.

5273
04:21:47,750 --> 04:21:49,330
You know what I'm saying?

5274
04:21:49,450 --> 04:21:51,290
You put me down so you can put yourself up?

5275
04:21:51,550 --> 04:21:52,270
Yeah, man.

5276
04:21:52,330 --> 04:21:53,130
It's because I love you.

5277
04:21:53,190 --> 04:21:53,690
You get it.

5278
04:21:53,850 --> 04:21:54,630
Yeah, you get it, bro.

5279
04:21:54,910 --> 04:21:56,490
Oh, man.

5280
04:21:59,630 --> 04:22:02,490
Do you have anything to say to your biggest fan?

5281
04:22:03,390 --> 04:22:04,450
No, QP, I love you, dude.

5282
04:22:04,550 --> 04:22:05,350
Keep doing what you're doing.

5283
04:22:05,350 --> 04:22:06,430
Yeah, I love you, too.

5284
04:22:06,650 --> 04:22:07,250
I love you, dude.

5285
04:22:07,310 --> 04:22:08,490
You're so fucking awesome, man.

5286
04:22:08,490 --> 04:22:09,210
You guys are awesome.

5287
04:22:11,690 --> 04:22:17,490
I want to give a huge shout out to every VTuber that we've met so far.

5288
04:22:17,890 --> 04:22:19,450
Specifically me, that I've interacted with.

5289
04:22:19,690 --> 04:22:21,110
Whether you're from Japan, like NA.

5290
04:22:21,290 --> 04:22:22,330
They're all so fucking cool.

5291
04:22:23,210 --> 04:22:25,170
VTubers are such rad people.

5292
04:22:25,290 --> 04:22:26,950
They're such accepting people as well.

5293
04:22:27,370 --> 04:22:29,090
I just wish more people had that mental.

5294
04:22:29,250 --> 04:22:34,250
Let people be themselves and just have a good time and pursue their dreams no matter what.

5295
04:22:34,330 --> 04:22:35,950
I absolutely love it, dude.

5296
04:22:36,050 --> 04:22:41,110
If I didn't show my face anywhere already, I'd probably be a VTuber right now.

5297
04:22:41,410 --> 04:22:44,110
What VTuber would you be, Wig?

5298
04:22:44,730 --> 04:22:49,430
I'd probably make myself a really jacked dude with some big boobies.

5299
04:22:52,330 --> 04:22:57,730
Wait, do you want to translate what Wig said to the girls?

5300
04:22:59,070 --> 04:23:01,470
I'd probably put a tail on it.

5301
04:23:03,010 --> 04:23:05,170
Wig, Dash, tell them what his VTuber model looks like.

5302
04:23:05,190 --> 04:23:07,110
I'd probably be a VTuber and...

5303
04:23:07,110 --> 04:23:08,130
What was it?

5304
04:23:08,430 --> 04:23:09,930
What kind of a big boobie?

5305
04:23:11,130 --> 04:23:12,010
Big boobie!

5306
04:23:14,510 --> 04:23:15,390
Big boobie!

5307
04:23:15,510 --> 04:23:15,810
I know!

5308
04:23:15,870 --> 04:23:16,750
Big boobie!

5309
04:23:19,170 --> 04:23:20,850
At least they're on board with it.

5310
04:23:21,350 --> 04:23:22,430
At least they're into it.

5311
04:23:22,430 --> 04:23:24,310
What's gonna attract hella people, Naswig?

5312
04:23:24,670 --> 04:23:25,470
I mean, listen.

5313
04:23:26,110 --> 04:23:27,570
Get some cat ears on there.

5314
04:23:27,650 --> 04:23:28,210
That's the vibe.

5315
04:23:28,290 --> 04:23:29,350
That's just the vibe I'd be rocking.

5316
04:23:30,030 --> 04:23:30,470
100%.

5317
04:23:30,470 --> 04:23:31,390
Greek, would you?

5318
04:23:32,730 --> 04:23:34,390
He's like, I'm done.

5319
04:23:34,870 --> 04:23:36,950
I'm back.

5320
04:23:37,610 --> 04:23:40,310
Greek, what would your VTuber model look like, Greek?

5321
04:23:41,750 --> 04:23:43,410
I'd probably make it like a Greek god.

5322
04:23:44,970 --> 04:23:46,930
You know what my model's gonna be?

5323
04:23:48,050 --> 04:23:48,950
Minecraft Steve.

5324
04:23:51,130 --> 04:23:52,290
Minecraft Steve!

5325
04:23:53,970 --> 04:23:55,570
I'm built like you.

5326
04:23:55,570 --> 04:23:56,770
Gigachat you, bro.

5327
04:23:58,110 --> 04:23:59,470
Anime Minecraft Steve.

5328
04:24:00,510 --> 04:24:01,390
That's crazy.

5329
04:24:02,270 --> 04:24:03,310
Dude, that was so fun.

5330
04:24:03,390 --> 04:24:04,690
Doki, thank you so much.

5331
04:24:05,050 --> 04:24:06,150
Thank you so much.

5332
04:24:07,130 --> 04:24:07,530
Thank you.

5333
04:24:09,330 --> 04:24:10,410
Thank you, everybody.

5334
04:24:12,150 --> 04:24:12,710
Thank y'all.

5335
04:24:12,810 --> 04:24:13,610
Love you guys so much.

5336
04:24:13,850 --> 04:24:14,290
GG's.

5337
04:24:15,090 --> 04:24:15,810
GG's, everyone.

5338
04:24:16,550 --> 04:24:16,990
GG's.

5339
04:24:17,390 --> 04:24:19,990
The next Yakiniku is on me, bro.

5340
04:24:19,990 --> 04:24:21,270
Alright, deal, bro.

5341
04:24:24,070 --> 04:24:24,670
Yakiniku!

5342
04:24:25,350 --> 04:24:25,950
Yakiniku!

5343
04:24:26,750 --> 04:24:27,210
Yakiniku!

5344
04:24:27,710 --> 04:24:28,730
That's her, baby.

5345
04:24:29,370 --> 04:24:30,730
Deal, deal, deal.

5346
04:24:31,710 --> 04:24:32,590
I love y'all, man.

5347
04:24:32,690 --> 04:24:33,130
GG's.

5348
04:24:33,130 --> 04:24:33,930
GG's, everyone.

5349
04:24:34,190 --> 04:24:34,590
GG's.

5350
04:24:34,590 --> 04:24:35,590
Thank you all for coming.

5351
04:24:35,730 --> 04:24:37,210
I really appreciate it, guys.

5352
04:24:37,330 --> 04:24:38,090
Thank you.

5353
04:24:38,430 --> 04:24:39,530
Thank you, everybody.

5354
04:24:40,990 --> 04:24:41,590
Bye.

5355
04:24:41,830 --> 04:24:44,310
Bye-bye.

5356
04:24:44,790 --> 04:24:46,330
Bye-bye.

5357
04:24:48,930 --> 04:24:50,690
Yeah, IRS gets you in the end.

5358
04:24:50,870 --> 04:24:51,530
Can't avoid it.

5359
04:24:52,010 --> 04:24:52,950
IRS always gets you.

5360
04:24:55,950 --> 04:24:57,370
They always get you.

5361
04:24:57,510 --> 04:24:58,370
Alright, GG's, guys.

5362
04:24:58,470 --> 04:25:01,250
Thank you again for helping out everybody.

5363
04:25:01,350 --> 04:25:01,730
Yeah, of course.

5364
04:25:02,070 --> 04:25:02,710
Thanks for having us.

5365
04:25:02,890 --> 04:25:03,310
We appreciate it.

5366
04:25:03,310 --> 04:25:03,710
Thank you.

5367
04:25:03,730 --> 04:25:04,870
I really appreciate it.

5368
04:25:05,030 --> 04:25:05,510
Thank you.

5369
04:25:05,690 --> 04:25:06,990
I'm gonna talk to you in my chat.

5370
04:25:07,390 --> 04:25:08,350
I'll see you, guys.

5371
04:25:08,670 --> 04:25:10,370
Thanks, Altair, for being on my team.

5372
04:25:10,750 --> 04:25:14,490
And thanks, Temple, for holding the fort down while I played the game.

5373
04:25:14,490 --> 04:25:15,750
Okay, we're back.

5374
04:25:16,230 --> 04:25:17,570
Congratulations on an amazing event.

5375
04:25:18,050 --> 04:25:18,610
Thank you.

5376
04:25:19,310 --> 04:25:20,330
Heads up.

5377
04:25:22,010 --> 04:25:25,370
So everyone that got second was a different team.

5378
04:25:26,230 --> 04:25:27,410
So we're all good there.

5379
04:25:29,430 --> 04:25:32,890
Every team that won money was also a different team.

5380
04:25:33,390 --> 04:25:33,410
Okay.

5381
04:25:34,490 --> 04:25:35,270
We're good there.

5382
04:25:35,450 --> 04:25:38,770
And then we have coins for the third place teams.

5383
04:25:39,230 --> 04:25:39,390
Yeah.

5384
04:25:40,270 --> 04:25:49,170
And then I've got everyone else down for So anyone who didn't win anything will also get coins.

5385
04:25:49,510 --> 04:25:51,770
So that is all good to go.

5386
04:25:51,830 --> 04:25:54,690
I'll start sending All right.

5387
04:25:54,950 --> 04:25:55,430
Cool.

5388
04:25:55,770 --> 04:25:57,630
Yeah, no problem.

5389
04:25:58,110 --> 04:26:01,250
Yeah, just talk to me after the stream and then we'll discuss about everything else.

5390
04:26:01,730 --> 04:26:02,190
All right.

5391
04:26:02,730 --> 04:26:03,330
Oh, hey, Jen.

5392
04:26:04,650 --> 04:26:05,990
Hey, welcome back.

5393
04:26:06,530 --> 04:26:08,410
We were just about to call it here.

5394
04:26:09,430 --> 04:26:11,470
Thank you for joining my team, Jen.

5395
04:26:12,330 --> 04:26:12,810
Thank you.

5396
04:26:12,810 --> 04:26:13,630
Thank you for the invite.

5397
04:26:13,850 --> 04:26:15,030
You're the one that made me play.

5398
04:26:15,230 --> 04:26:15,750
Yeah, I know.

5399
04:26:15,830 --> 04:26:17,350
You were not going to join unless it was on my team.

5400
04:26:17,410 --> 04:26:17,770
I know.

5401
04:26:19,010 --> 04:26:20,570
Okay, were you going to get someone else though?

5402
04:26:20,630 --> 04:26:22,290
Or you heard this and then got me?

5403
04:26:22,370 --> 04:26:22,650
Okay.

5404
04:26:22,970 --> 04:26:23,870
Or did you actually want me on your team?

5405
04:26:23,870 --> 04:26:25,010
No, you were definitely planning.

5406
04:26:26,030 --> 04:26:28,390
No, no, no.

5407
04:26:28,550 --> 04:26:29,430
You're dodging the question.

5408
04:26:30,070 --> 04:26:31,730
Did you actually want me on your team or not?

5409
04:26:31,930 --> 04:26:32,610
No, of course.

5410
04:26:33,350 --> 04:26:34,490
I requested you.

5411
04:26:35,310 --> 04:26:35,630
Okay.

5412
04:26:36,650 --> 04:26:37,810
That's why I told Tempo.

5413
04:26:38,410 --> 04:26:40,370
Because when you said no, I told Tempo.

5414
04:26:40,910 --> 04:26:42,370
Because I was like, Tempo, I want Jen.

5415
04:26:42,490 --> 04:26:43,710
And then you were like...

5416
04:26:43,710 --> 04:26:45,170
You want me to say what he said?

5417
04:26:45,250 --> 04:26:45,750
I'll call you.

5418
04:26:46,050 --> 04:26:47,750
I'll say the entire chat log.

5419
04:26:48,150 --> 04:26:50,090
You said, I'm still in Australia.

5420
04:26:50,410 --> 04:26:52,670
I can't play West Coast Ping.

5421
04:26:53,130 --> 04:26:56,150
And I was like, doesn't he play Rank in West Coast?

5422
04:26:56,570 --> 04:26:59,110
And Tempo was like, yeah, that's a cop-out answer.

5423
04:26:59,450 --> 04:27:02,010
So I was like, tell Jen that's going to be on my team.

5424
04:27:02,190 --> 04:27:04,330
And then you instantly said yes after that.

5425
04:27:05,510 --> 04:27:06,710
I'm a bad responder.

5426
04:27:06,710 --> 04:27:09,550
When I saw that, I instantly responded.

5427
04:27:11,670 --> 04:27:12,790
Yeah, exactly.

5428
04:27:13,390 --> 04:27:14,750
That's fucking right.

5429
04:27:15,830 --> 04:27:17,690
Because last time was hella fun.

5430
04:27:17,970 --> 04:27:22,370
Yeah, the one melee match that we had.

5431
04:27:22,510 --> 04:27:24,230
You mean the one game we had?

5432
04:27:25,310 --> 04:27:26,870
Was it only one game?

5433
04:27:27,010 --> 04:27:28,330
Yeah, we had one game.

5434
04:27:29,170 --> 04:27:31,210
No, it was Random Royale.

5435
04:27:31,290 --> 04:27:32,650
And it was one game.

5436
04:27:33,310 --> 04:27:34,450
It was hella fun though.

5437
04:27:34,450 --> 04:27:35,630
It was with the girl too.

5438
04:27:35,710 --> 04:27:36,870
I forgot her name.

5439
04:27:36,950 --> 04:27:38,430
I forgot her name too.

5440
04:27:38,690 --> 04:27:41,910
But thanks for the invite.

5441
04:27:42,490 --> 04:27:43,870
I'm going to take a shower now.

5442
04:27:43,950 --> 04:27:44,950
Because I stink!

5443
04:27:45,350 --> 04:27:47,610
And we've got to dub the weapons with the prize.

5444
04:27:48,650 --> 04:27:50,550
Tempo is going to DM us about it.

5445
04:27:51,390 --> 04:27:51,650
Okay.

5446
04:27:52,750 --> 04:27:53,190
GG's.

5447
04:27:53,270 --> 04:27:54,370
Have a good day.

5448
04:27:56,730 --> 04:27:57,410
GG's Dash.

5449
04:27:57,470 --> 04:27:59,010
Thanks for translating for everybody.

5450
04:27:59,130 --> 04:28:00,190
I really appreciate it.

5451
04:28:00,190 --> 04:28:01,490
Thank you man.

5452
04:28:02,330 --> 04:28:03,090
GG's.

5453
04:28:03,930 --> 04:28:05,290
Alright guys.

5454
04:28:05,870 --> 04:28:08,550
That was a crazy event.

5455
04:28:09,250 --> 04:28:11,450
I had a lot to learn.

5456
04:28:12,010 --> 04:28:18,290
I definitely had a lot to learn for it because I did feel really bad for the teams that weren't super stacked.

5457
04:28:18,730 --> 04:28:22,950
I tried my best to steer for buffs and nerfs.

5458
04:28:23,470 --> 04:28:29,150
I do hope that even the teams that weren't super stacked still had a okay time.

5459
04:28:29,710 --> 04:28:31,830
I definitely had a lot to learn regarding it.

5460
04:28:32,270 --> 04:28:33,970
Definitely would improve so much.

5461
04:28:34,070 --> 04:28:35,790
I'm going to personally apologize to some of the teams.

5462
04:28:36,910 --> 04:28:44,350
I know that it might have been really tough especially on teams that might not be incredibly stacked versus others.

5463
04:28:46,070 --> 04:28:50,990
But I do hope that overall everybody had a lot of fun.

5464
04:28:51,510 --> 04:28:54,110
Everybody enjoyed it.

5465
04:28:54,310 --> 04:28:57,330
It was really unfortunate that the ping was really high.

5466
04:29:01,550 --> 04:29:06,770
Tempo said he tried to put it in Oregon.

5467
04:29:07,170 --> 04:29:09,430
I was confused why it was at 300 ping.

5468
04:29:10,490 --> 04:29:15,910
I really hoped that we could figure out that issue.

5469
04:29:16,490 --> 04:29:21,910
I did want it to be APAC and NA together because of ALGS and everything.

5470
04:29:23,310 --> 04:29:32,570
I did hope that as a first event we had a lot to learn and I hope that a lot of people still had a lot of fun watching for the first event and playing.

5471
04:29:34,030 --> 04:29:35,730
Thank you everybody for watching.

5472
04:29:36,150 --> 04:29:40,730
I'm going to have another post-event stream to explain more about the whole thing process.

5473
04:29:41,190 --> 04:29:42,330
I'm just glad it was over.

5474
04:29:42,450 --> 04:29:44,330
I had a great time playing with Altair and Jen.

5475
04:29:45,550 --> 04:29:53,910
I had a lot of fun time interacting with the casters, interacting with different people, VTubers and everything.

5476
04:29:56,230 --> 04:29:59,470
Definitely was a great experience.

5477
04:29:59,690 --> 04:30:04,970
I cried a lot organizing this because it was done by me, Tempo and Dash.

5478
04:30:06,070 --> 04:30:10,010
Us three, we worked incredibly hard putting all this together.

5479
04:30:10,370 --> 04:30:13,950
A huge shout out to EA for sponsoring the prize pool.

5480
04:30:14,510 --> 04:30:21,570
Last Minute and Gamersups for donating medals and enamel pins for all the participants.

5481
04:30:22,110 --> 04:30:26,530
If you want to support me, please order from the Gamersup collection because it does help us a lot.

5482
04:30:26,890 --> 04:30:28,630
It helps my relationship with Gamersups.

5483
04:30:29,590 --> 04:30:32,730
Hire Tempo for those who are part of an org.

5484
04:30:33,190 --> 04:30:34,150
Hire this man.

5485
04:30:34,390 --> 04:30:36,110
He has done so much.

5486
04:30:36,710 --> 04:30:40,210
He has coordinated the server while I was playing the video game.

5487
04:30:44,290 --> 04:30:49,230
If anybody who's part of an org is looking for a manager, he is that guy.

5488
04:30:49,450 --> 04:30:50,850
He's single too, I guess.

5489
04:30:50,990 --> 04:30:52,530
Ladies and men, he's single.

5490
04:30:58,070 --> 04:30:59,550
Definitely a lot to learn.

5491
04:31:00,890 --> 04:31:05,370
I just hope overall it was a fun event to watch overall.

5492
04:31:05,890 --> 04:31:10,110
I'm happy that I was able to let QP interact with Wig.

5493
04:31:10,170 --> 04:31:20,530
I noticed that QP was a huge fan of Wig so I asked if she really wanted to talk to him because I know that team really wanted to win to be able to talk to Wig.

5494
04:31:20,690 --> 04:31:28,430
I figured I'll use my interview to give QP's team a chance to interact with him.

5495
04:31:30,890 --> 04:31:32,010
I'm sorry.

5496
04:31:32,270 --> 04:31:33,730
I'm sorry daddy's hunky.

5497
04:31:34,030 --> 04:31:34,630
I'm sorry.

5498
04:31:35,210 --> 04:31:35,870
Don't worry.

5499
04:31:35,990 --> 04:31:37,230
I'll get you food soon.

5500
04:31:38,530 --> 04:31:39,830
I'll get you food soon.

5501
04:31:40,190 --> 04:31:46,650
Anyway guys, I will have a post after event chatting stream in an hour.

5502
04:31:48,110 --> 04:31:49,410
Thank you everybody.

5503
04:31:49,950 --> 04:31:51,130
Actually I'll make it now.

5504
04:31:51,250 --> 04:31:52,170
I'll make the waiting room now.

5505
04:31:52,590 --> 04:31:53,650
Is there a thumbnail I could use?

5506
04:31:56,990 --> 04:31:58,230
To talk more about.

5507
04:31:58,490 --> 04:31:59,970
I need you guys to know I cried a lot.

5508
04:32:00,170 --> 04:32:03,470
Every day I cried trying to do this custom.

5509
04:32:06,370 --> 04:32:20,670
I was not joking when I said for this custom I was mostly crying trying to get all of this figured out every day.

5510
04:32:21,350 --> 04:32:28,170
I always had some fire to fix and it was crazy.

5511
04:32:30,750 --> 04:32:34,530
There was a lot of last minute changes and everything.

5512
04:32:35,370 --> 04:32:41,350
I just really do hope people in the end still had a decent time.

5513
04:32:42,150 --> 04:32:45,670
I'll talk more about it at the post event.

5514
04:32:46,570 --> 04:32:48,430
What do I name this?

5515
04:32:48,550 --> 04:32:50,530
Let me make the waiting room guys.

5516
04:32:52,370 --> 04:32:53,270
Thank you guys.

5517
04:32:53,390 --> 04:32:55,110
I really appreciate it.

5518
04:32:55,490 --> 04:32:57,130
I'm going to make the waiting room real quick.

5519
04:32:57,710 --> 04:32:58,550
I don't even remember.

5520
04:32:59,290 --> 04:33:00,050
Dad, I'm sorry.

5521
04:33:00,170 --> 04:33:00,670
I'm sorry.

5522
04:33:00,850 --> 04:33:03,750
I just need to make a waiting room so I can read myself.

5523
04:33:04,130 --> 04:33:05,630
I can read myself.

5524
04:33:08,330 --> 04:33:11,410
Apex custom afterparty.

5525
04:33:11,610 --> 04:33:12,510
Guys, I need a thumbnail.

5526
04:33:12,630 --> 04:33:13,430
What do I use?

5527
04:33:14,190 --> 04:33:16,010
What do I use for my thumbnail?

5528
04:33:16,310 --> 04:33:17,570
I don't have a thumbnail.

5529
04:33:17,970 --> 04:33:19,450
This is...

5530
04:33:19,990 --> 04:33:21,150
I'll just use this.

5531
04:33:21,630 --> 04:33:23,130
I'll use the credit slide.

5532
04:33:23,830 --> 04:33:24,810
Also, a huge shout out.

5533
04:33:24,870 --> 04:33:27,370
I don't know if you guys noticed, but I had a new overlay.

5534
04:33:28,690 --> 04:33:29,130
And...

5535
04:33:30,950 --> 04:33:31,810
Oh my gosh.

5536
04:33:32,170 --> 04:33:33,150
I need to get the name.

5537
04:33:33,150 --> 04:33:38,870
And I want to say Artemis was the one that made the old and the new Apex overlay.

5538
04:33:39,130 --> 04:33:43,190
I forgot to credit her when she made the first overlay.

5539
04:33:43,490 --> 04:33:47,690
So Artemis did the new and old Apex overlay.

5540
04:33:48,150 --> 04:33:49,150
So huge shout out to her.

5541
04:33:49,230 --> 04:33:51,610
I think when I got the old overlay, I had to go through a lot of other stuff.

5542
04:33:53,410 --> 04:33:54,470
So I'm sorry.

5543
04:33:54,710 --> 04:33:55,850
But I did it.

5544
04:33:56,830 --> 04:33:57,750
I'm so sorry.

5545
04:33:57,790 --> 04:33:58,530
I really love it.

5546
04:33:58,590 --> 04:34:00,170
I love the Apex overlay.

5547
04:34:00,430 --> 04:34:00,890
You did.

5548
04:34:00,890 --> 04:34:01,790
It's okay.

5549
04:34:01,870 --> 04:34:02,690
It's over.

5550
04:34:02,930 --> 04:34:03,150
Okay.

5551
04:34:04,810 --> 04:34:11,710
Doki Bird Apex Oversight Custom Lots to improve on.

5552
04:34:16,670 --> 04:34:17,570
It's over.

5553
04:34:18,110 --> 04:34:19,270
What do I call it?

5554
04:34:19,470 --> 04:34:21,170
What do I title it, guys?

5555
04:34:21,290 --> 04:34:23,990
What should I title it, chat?

5556
04:34:24,050 --> 04:34:25,290
I don't know what to title it.

5557
04:34:26,470 --> 04:34:29,030
What should my title be for the after party?

5558
04:34:31,950 --> 04:34:33,630
I cried a lot.

5559
04:34:35,050 --> 04:34:35,590
Yes!

5560
04:34:37,390 --> 04:34:38,350
Organizing it.

5561
04:34:38,670 --> 04:34:39,410
There we go.

5562
04:34:40,350 --> 04:34:41,010
There we go.

5563
04:34:41,130 --> 04:34:42,090
That's gonna be the title.

5564
04:34:42,230 --> 04:34:43,970
I cried a lot organizing it.

5565
04:34:44,070 --> 04:34:44,430
It's fine.

5566
04:34:44,550 --> 04:34:45,130
I'm free.

5567
04:34:45,790 --> 04:34:47,190
I'm free now.

5568
04:34:50,390 --> 04:34:52,070
That's my title.

5569
04:34:52,610 --> 04:34:52,830
Alright.

5570
04:34:53,410 --> 04:34:56,410
I'll put it at 1115 and I'll rate it into it.

5571
04:34:56,410 --> 04:34:57,450
But thank you guys.

5572
04:34:57,530 --> 04:35:01,730
I'll talk more about it but thank you to all the people who joined.

5573
04:35:02,210 --> 04:35:03,730
Thank you for my teammates.

5574
04:35:03,950 --> 04:35:04,810
Thank you for the casters.

5575
04:35:05,230 --> 04:35:14,810
The fact that Wig and Greek were willing to do it for free because usually casters are paid and I asked if they want to be paid and they're like, no, no we will do it for free and I really appreciate it.

5576
04:35:15,250 --> 04:35:24,770
Wig had almost backed out halfway through because he had an important hangout session today and I said, it's your choice.

5577
04:35:24,930 --> 04:35:26,170
I don't want to force you to do it.

5578
04:35:26,230 --> 04:35:27,770
He's like, no, you're my homie.

5579
04:35:29,310 --> 04:35:34,030
I'm gonna stick it all the way to the end and I really appreciate it for Greek and Wig for saying that.

5580
04:35:34,690 --> 04:35:44,730
Like I said, thank you to everybody that was part of it and I hope that I can improve it more in the future because I have a lot to learn.

5581
04:35:44,950 --> 04:35:47,330
Definitely a lot to learn regarding this.

5582
04:35:48,830 --> 04:35:49,990
I really appreciate it.

5583
04:35:50,050 --> 04:35:54,610
Anyway guys, I'm gonna rate into that and then we'll have more of a longer talk.

5584
04:35:54,890 --> 04:35:55,970
Thank you everybody for watching.

5585
04:35:56,050 --> 04:36:02,110
As always, everyone stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing and if you stay up for me, head to bed cause you deserve it.

5586
04:36:02,230 --> 04:36:03,350
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

5587
04:36:03,670 --> 04:36:04,250
Bye guys!
