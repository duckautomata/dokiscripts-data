60
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,230
There is Immortal Firebird.

61
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:20,590

62
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,390

65
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:32,260
oh shit that is cool Oh my, okay, Mecha Knight is pretty cool.

66
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,720
If only I play Moon Knight.

67
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,280
It's random bullshit time!

68
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,060
Oh my god, he's going ape mode.

69
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,020
He's charging up.

70
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,300
Go, go, Mighty!

71
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,400
Wait, he's that big?

72
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,200
Okay, I might be a little too OP, guys.

73
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:01,740
Like, in the patch notes, it'll be like, Um, we've made Moon Knight 80 feet tall and that's it.

74
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,860
Like go go 90 of it.

75
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,280
Wait, that's so cool.

76
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,140
I know he was an actual mecha.

77
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,200
Holy shit.

78
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,940
If he's 80, Moon Knight is now 100 feet tall.

79
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,280
We've made his hitbox, but it's still the same hitbox.

80
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,220
You just gotta figure out which one's the head.

81
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,000
He changed size, but like the hitbox is still like his old hitbox.

82
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,820
He just gotta figure out which one is ahead.

83
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,840
Oh yeah, this spray is pretty hard.

84
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,600
Goes really hard.

85
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,520
I like, I love, I love this.

86
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,720
This one's my favorite.

87
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,980
And then, oh, if only they had like, I don't know, rocket underneath his foot.

88
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,580
That would have been like the best part.

89
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:25,940
stand on you can squish someone at the end if only then it would have been perfect all right finally all right it's time it's time to check out angela so i saw a little bit of the videos of angela's gameplay and like basically she flies it's like a flying tank so you don't know i mean to be fair like she's huge so you'll know exactly where she is but it's also a little scary because That requires us to look up.

90
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,920
And we know gamers don't look up.

91
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,300
She's also four out of five.

92
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:36,540
I didn't know who Angela was before the reveal.

93
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,940
Because, like, you know, I'm a Marvel normie.

94
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,200
I'm a Marvel normie.

95
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,640
So, like, mostly the things I know about Marvel is, like, the cinematic universe.

96
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,560
So I didn't know that she was actually...

97
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,360
She's actually one of, like, Thor and Loki's sisters.

98
00:13:53,520 --> 00:14:21,720
um just like hella so i didn't know that because um so that was really interesting so she's like she's like part of the family part of the asgardian family um so here are her skins oh what's this skull 20 oh wait that skin is okay that skin is sick that's like it's like cyberpunk ish Oh,

99
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,520
first appears.

100
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,800
Oh, they made this.

101
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,700
This first appears in Marvel Rivals.

102
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,760
So, like, Marvel Rivals specifically designed the skin.

103
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,280
Because I was like, oh, what comic is this from?

104
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,500
But they designed it.

105
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,740
Oh, but it's...

106
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,180
I'm sorry.

107
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,540
But it's perfect in every way, except it hides her abs.

108
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,460
Yeah, no abs, 0 out of 10.

109
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,360
It's almost perfect.

110
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,800
I need my ab window.

111
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,460
It needed an ab window.

112
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,560
So true.

113
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,860
It should have been transparent.

114
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,820
There should be an option where you can toggle an ab window.

115
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,200
And it's like toggle on and off.

116
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:03,980
So you can show.

117
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,400
Just as you're about to kill someone.

118
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,600
You toggle the window on.

119
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,920
So at least it gets a little something before they die.

120
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,780
The real.

121
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,540
Oh yeah.

122
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,740
What's the MVP like?

123
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,300
Imagine the customization.

124
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,420
Oh, they added a new...

125
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,900
They added a ton of new customization.

126
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,780
Like, you can design, like, your track colors now, too.

127
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,420
Yeah, this MVP skin...

128
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,020
MVP one is pretty sick.

129
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,700
All right, what about the emotes?

130
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,200
Ooh.

131
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,620
For heaven!

132
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,140
All right.

133
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,700
I know some of you guys wanted to look at the...

134
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,060
Oh!

135
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,120
Okay, the Lord!

136
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,940
The Lord is really sick.

137
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,800
I like that.

138
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,480
I actually, I really like the Lord icon for this.

139
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,060
For those who want to see it better.

140
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,780
That's actually pretty sick.

141
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,420
Compared to the default, this is actually a really good Lord icon.

142
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:03,860
Yeah.

143
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,960
I like that.

144
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:06,620
All right.

145
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,500
Wait, what's this?

146
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,400
Oh, that's just Asgardian language.

147
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,540
I was like, what's that on the bottom?

148
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,320
That's your name.

149
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:11,820
All right.

150
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:12,900
It's time.

151
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,000
Lunge forward with your spear dealing damage.

152
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,520
Oh my God.

153
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,120
Look, she's flat.

154
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,460
Wait, do I have like...

155
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,200
Oh, she flies all the time.

00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,540
Assassin's Charge.

158
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,560
Yeah, she can fight the Flyers.

159
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,960
She's literally the tank for Vanguard's.

160
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,880
Like the tank against Flyers.

161
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:07,790
Oh, that's interesting.

162
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,430
Oh my god, okay, now I know why she's four stars.

163
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,530
Look at all these abilities.

164
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,110
Oh my god.

165
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,210
Okay, that's a lot.

166
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,490
Okay, I'm glad I'm not a Vanguard main.

167
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,930
I'm glad that is a lot.

168
00:17:22,350 --> 00:18:05,670
in the shield gaining attack charge when absorbing damage okay transforms anchors into a shield okay so that's her shield so she can pull out a shield make the sky switching back to okay and then she then do like a slam dunk wait what's the difference between this one dive downwards switch to oh wait is it two different attacks wait i don't understand oh within the zone gain enhanced speed and attacks grants bonus help to self-end your oh she can heal her allies oh with this weapon okay i get it and then this is her fly look at her go wee wee all right what's her passive

169
00:18:09,180 --> 00:19:07,360
apparently people are saying that thor is gonna be really broken this season or the new season oh yeah what about the new team ups i didn't really read much about the new team magic right or yeah magic what does magic do oh it's chained together okay uh chains two enemies and slows them the further they are apart the greater okay so basically basically that you guys have to stick close together yeah which sucks because everyone when you're against magic the key is you're supposed to not be together when you're against magic because then her her her sword can just like slash you through that's gonna be really rough oh this one i heard i saw this one it's basically when you're low hp you get your own like little bubble to be safe all right let's go practice range tab

170
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:28,580
practice range all right the new tank looks very difficult to play, only because like, I feel like just lying around is always hard to move when you're in the air, in general.

171
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,840
And then like, she has a lot of moves.

172
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,060
Okay, that right click is her shield.

173
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:45,940
I'm like a crow that's like here to terrorize like, get out of here!

174
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,560
This is my territory!

175
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,720
Just stabbing down.

176
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,440
Just burp things, you know?

177
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,200
Alright.

178
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,660
I mean, I hope she gets a crow costume.

179
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,620
I mean, it would fit.

180
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,360
Okay, that's a shield.

181
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,800
And then...

182
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,960
Oh, I heard you can do, like, a...

183
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,520
Environmental kill with this.

184
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,920
I saw, like, in the trailer.

185
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,700
If I can hit it.

186
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,820
Okay, this one's a...

187
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,560
This is a little hard to control.

188
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,600
This is a little hard.

189
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,760
Okay, that's a cooldown.

190
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:29,240
Depending on how far you want to take him, it's a cooldown.

191
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,280
But it feels...

192
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,280
It feels a little difficult.

193
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,500
I got trapped in first, you're right.

194
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,760
And then go with it.

195
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,100
Oh, wait, I can't fly.

196
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,240
Oh, I can't fly when I trap them?

197
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:43,760
Wait, is that...

198
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,400
Wait, how do I...

199
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,100
Oh, oh, wings.

200
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,400
Oh, okay, I get it.

201
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,160
I get it.

202
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,320
There is a cooldown.

203
00:20:50,300 --> 00:22:10,500
there is a cooldown when I try it yeah I become melee when I do that oh I see it and then oh there you go and I can fly after I land down and I go fuck you can tell I'm not a Vanguard player it's very it's it's a lot it's actually it's so much information it's a lot of info this one this is a tank where you gotta have a big ass brain up there okay and then it drags okay so can they like get out of that i wonder wait can they get out of that team up where's the alt queue angela can leap the spirit damaging surrounding enemies and creating divine judgment upon impact buys oh it binds them so they can't okay i see gotta fly why would you never want to fly to me it's so it's already so hard to hit a flying target to be fair all right oh they can't leave look at them that's right you're in my world now Oh,

204
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,080
wait.

205
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,100
Oh, that's scary.

206
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,380
I can't leave yet.

207
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,540
Oh, you guys want a nicer view?

208
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,740
Give me a sec.

209
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,760
Alright, where is she?

210
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,720
Where's Angela?

211
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:29,660
Oh, wait.

212
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,740
And then...

213
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,520
Give me a sec.

214
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,360
Knowing is literally half the battle.

215
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,880
Is that...

216
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,080
There you go.

217
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,740
There you go.

218
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:45,620
Now I can go.

219
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,080
Don't say I don't give nothing to you guys.

220
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:55,720
This is the perks of me having early access, guys.

221
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,700
You're like, okay, now I can leave the stream.

222
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,040
I got one.

223
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,320
I don't want it.

224
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,700
Death by Snooshnu.

225
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,180
Now we are talking.

226
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:11,400
See?

227
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,460
Don't say I don't give you nothing.

228
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,680
She is so... She is so much.

229
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,640
Like, my brain is like... Like... Not running at, like, any...

230
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,220
My brain is on dial-up right now.

231
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,340
Trying to understand her playstyle.

232
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,560
It's just so much in general.

233
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,100
I think the shift is gonna be really fun, though.

234
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,460
For sure.

235
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,340
pull down.

236
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,260
That's how I want to go.

237
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,520
Put me in, Coach Astaria.

238
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,260
Thank you for the thousand goodies.

239
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:47,780
Thank you.

240
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,420
Thank you.

241
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:55,820
I feel like you have to like, what's the word, be able to juggle between lying and being on the ground.

242
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:02,520
Like knowing when your team needs you on the ground and knowing when you have to be in the air and stuff.

243
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,560
I feel like she'll have like a lot.

244
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:09,500
She certainly has a lot of movement abilities in general because of how she can just switch utils.

245
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:15,400
Especially if she wants to be anti-air or, I guess, grounded.

246
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,700
Does her axe track?

247
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,200
Okay, I mean, I can try.

248
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,420
Alright, let's see.

249
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,640
I don't think so.

250
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,360
But her range is pretty good.

251
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,360
Wait, what?

252
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,720
Wait, okay.

253
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,580
Okay, it's here.

254
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,260
I can hit people from here.

255
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,620
Basically.

256
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,420
Yeah, this is her- this is the range of her act- Rep.

257
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,600
She's abusing the hitbox!

258
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,980
That's how far the range is.

259
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:56,060
Um, um, for, uh, for a melee.

260
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,540
I mean, I could try the air attack too.

261
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,140
Let's see.

262
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,040
Extendo arm.

263
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,320
Okay, how far?

264
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,300
I mean, it's a very long axe, guys.

265
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,280
I must heal soon.

266
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:11,640
Oh, wait.

267
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,280
That's...

268
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:13,660
Whoops.

269
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,220
I forgot.

270
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,720
My descend key is...

271
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,020
Wait.

272
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:17,700
Do I have...

273
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,900
Can she descend?

274
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,620
Give me a sec.

275
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,560
I gotta know.

276
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,480
Can she descend?

277
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,120
No, I just had it.

278
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:26,660
I'm buying it.

279
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,080
There you go.

280
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,040
There we go.

281
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:29,460
Okay.

282
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,860
I was gonna be like...

283
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,800
I was like...

284
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,000
That would be fucking weird if she can't fly down.

285
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,400
That's the range.

286
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,340
How far is that?

287
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,140
I'm pretty...

288
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,440
I'm pretty high up above him.

289
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,380
I'm literally about to, like, stomp him on it.

290
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,880
I'm not even close to stomping him on his head.

291
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,360
But my axe is pretty long.

292
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,480
Okay, it's up here.

293
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,020
This is how high I can.

294
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,820
That's pretty high up.

295
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,480
I could just...

296
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,820
It would be like, she's right above me, isn't she?

297
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,380
And I'm like, poke!

298
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,720
It's a long-ass spear.

299
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:03,500
Poke!

300
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,540
Oh my god, I'm so high.

301
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:06,440
Look at me.

302
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,940
I'm just pecking at their head.

303
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,060
I'll be like, it's feeding time, children.

304
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,140
It's aura farming, hey.

305
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:23,860
Alright.

306
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,520
Let's see.

307
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,480
I mean, I think there's not really a lot of new team-ups.

308
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,480
It's just really this.

309
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:32,340
Alright.

310
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,360
Oh, I just got hit them.

311
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,440
Okay.

312
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,000
How far?

313
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:38,560
Okay, wait.

314
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,880
Practice settings.

315
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,640
Okay, yeah.

316
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,100
It doesn't have to be directly at them.

317
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,660
Like, here.

318
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,140
That's the closest I can get.

319
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,980
Yeah, they can still separate when they're dead.

320
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,020
I guess you can say that, you know?

321
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,500
I guess you can say that when they're dead.

322
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,580
You can separate.

323
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,360
Yeah?

324
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,200
It's so death do us part.

325
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,280
I mean, the hitbox is like here.

326
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,700
It's like here.

327
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,520
Oh, you can kill.

328
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,400
It does a lot of damage, too, for it.

329
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,560
I heard they buffed her as well, but I don't play magic.

330
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,560
I cannot understand melee characters.

331
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,080
And that's why I'm not a Vanguard player.

332
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,900
I can't understand at all, like, how to play melee.

333
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,140
I don't know.

334
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,560
It's just something about it.

335
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:33,840
Why?

336
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,260
I just, like, I don't like punching.

337
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,420
I just rather just shoot my gun.

338
00:27:36,440 --> 00:28:08,200
like and then it's basically this one is just what is this just passive you don't you can't set it off yourself I'm not shoot me shoot me oh show one that's all all right yeah I can do that I mean is loot all right let me yeah all right what would be a good here is it oh there you are I'm pulling them It's like they're just dead.

339
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:35,620
You can't survive a hydrogen bomb That's basically it I mean I feel like They get pulled I wonder like if you can like actually walk away a little I assume you can't I assume it's like an emma alt where where uh Where like uh You can't even like not look at them.

340
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,920
It's literally in the vicinity in any.

341
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,700
Because at least an ML just don't look, you know?

342
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,460
Just close your eyes for the ML.

343
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,700
Then you won't get mind controlled by her.

344
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,900
Just close your eyes.

345
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,920
But here you can't even close your eyes.

346
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,780
If you're like within the range, you get dragged in.

347
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,640
Yeah, she doesn't she doesn't, she can't mind control you if you just close your eyes.

348
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,940
What's my damage?

349
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,760
9,000.

350
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,040
But it's because I insta kill everybody.

351
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,000
There you go.

352
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,480
I mean, I can instantly kill her.

353
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,300
Yeah, see, I'm slowly coloring it.

354
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,940
So it's basically like no one can live.

355
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,400
No, it's not 999.

356
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,860
It's 9,999.

357
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:27,020
And for those who weren't here earlier, it's basically the old damage was 800.

358
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,640
And then they're like, that's not good enough.

359
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,140
We want her to erase people from existence.

360
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,640
So now it's 9,000.

361
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,600
Scarlet Witch.

362
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,780
Because they're like, it's not accurate enough.

363
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,680
She has to actually destroy everything.

364
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,640
Yeah, because like apparently Groot used to live through her old.

365
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,180
Oh, so they're like, we don't like that.

366
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,120
Fuck trees.

367
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,400
The good old Tyajun bomb.

368
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,120
Strat.

369
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,160
And then, that's why they created Mecha Knight!

370
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:14,560
HP is actually, um, Mecha Knight's HP is actually 10,000, so he would be the only one that can live through her all.

371
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,700
Alright, I think that's, is that all, like, the biggest changes that they did?

372
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,320
I know they did, like, what was it?

373
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:27,200
Oh, they buff Moon Knight, so she has he can do, oh, wait, as the overnight travelers.

374
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,680
So the thing they buff Moon Knight is that this, she has two of this now.

375
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,380
So for those who don't know, her is right.

376
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,220
So he can do two of this, and apparently is really strong.

377
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,340
Yeah, no survivors.

378
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,880
I didn't even kill Squishies now with this.

379
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,480
I'm pretty sure.

380
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,640
Alright, let's...

381
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,740
Oh yeah, Squish...

382
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,100
1 HP Squishies, yeah.

383
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:52,980
Oh yeah!

384
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,480
Jeff Alt got chain.

385
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,600
Yeah, so you can...

386
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,460
So if you have two...

387
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,940
Oh, I didn't buy the skin yet.

388
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:01,980
I'll do it later.

389
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,400
Yeah, so you can...

390
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,480
But it's like an 8 second cooldown.

391
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,580
So you have to wait.

392
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:38,720
wait that's a lot yeah i mean one blade was already alive um what else was it it changed oh jeff oh yeah the main arm is up is more of a heal now so let me grab that so basically this pool of all this pool heals now yeah so when i all i create a healing pool They didn't even change him.

393
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:43,360
They just made it so that every time I ult, I create a healing pool.

394
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,120
And so he can actually heal people while...

395
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,080
So it could be a defensive ult now.

396
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,620
Which is nice.

397
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,500
Also, they finally nerfed New Luna.

398
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:57,240
They finally made her, like, a little weaker.

399
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,320
Like, 1%.

400
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,620
Oh, my.

401
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,760
Wait, she has, like, a tail?

402
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:05,720
Oh, God.

403
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,600
That's so distracting.

404
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,100
I'm sorry.

405
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,580
That's...

406
00:32:07,600 --> 00:33:32,780
I don't know if I can play with this it's a little distracting the tale it's a little distracting for me um but they made it so that her alt her alt is oh is this new oh it's a new song oh I'm not used to that it is a new song so it's a lot oh my god it's a lot shorter feel like I can like go have a bathroom break while in the middle of a Luna all now I remember when you can like get a bathroom break go out to buy some groceries come back and all is still going so then you just you decide to walk your dog then your Loki copies you and then you're like you know what maybe I should pay do my taxes while I wait for the second Luna all get some coffee and feels a lot shorter um oh she can finally rest her voice now and then you and then after the low-key cop is you and done and then you have your luna alt again and those two seconds actually feels a lot shorter because i feel like the old alt i can like i can like go have a bathroom break make coffee and walk my dog and come back and the

407
00:33:32,780 --> 00:34:04,900
fight is still going on but now now i can only all right and now I just only have a bathroom break try Loki I don't think they change anything um with Loki Loki is consistently being nerfed no you don't understand Loki you guys should be lucky Loki didn't come in as beta Loki um um because during open during closed beta Loki was so

408
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:39,040
killed Loki during closed beta was so broken it was so bad um they basically nerfed his his damage you can get his ult so fast and basically like kill the entire lobby it was crazy like I was I was basically playing Loki the entire time is how strong he gets yeah so he doesn't do as much damage this is three loci's by the way look how little damage I do with three loci clones all right Okay,

409
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:50,940
actually no, it's not the fact that I do that much healing with three low-key clones All right All right, low-key clones you go over here You go here now.

410
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,920
I want to see how much healing I do with one.

411
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,160
Oh, that is that is scary

412
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,860
He does he does not a lot of heals guys.

413
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,740
He is by himself

414
00:35:10,160 --> 00:36:10,980
yeah he does not do a lot now he does not do a lot by himself like usually the best part is just his clones but it's not a lot of heals because i'd usually never try to heal by myself so you can like abuse the low-key heals but even then it's not that much heals now which is nice because i i okay which is not nice because i just got low-key lord i actually spent so much time to get loki lord i finally i finally got loki lord and they took up they took loki to the alleyway and i never saw him again i'm so sad i love oh yeah they buff ultron too it's all it's all there's like uh it's up there's a lot of damage now apparently from what i've heard they buff ultron's I can't tell because I don't get to play Ultron that much.

415
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:17,460
So I don't know how much exactly his alt does compared to his old one.

416
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,800
I'm so looking forward to the Mantis swimsuit skin.

417
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,120
Because they're releasing a second batch of...

418
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:31,020
They're releasing a second batch of Rival's summer outfits.

419
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,920
And the Mantis swimsuit skin is so cute.

420
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,480
Invisible Woman's skin, uh, no skin suit.

421
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,740
Invisible Woman's Summer's skin is so cute.

422
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,380
I love it.

423
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:49,660
I didn't earn my favorites so far in terms of, like, the next, uh, next skins coming up.

424
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,800
Oh yeah, and then the thing gets a second summer.

425
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,420
Like, no, I was just reading the trailer.

426
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,680
I'm not reading, plah, watching the trailer.

427
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,160
And I was just looking at the new skins that's coming up.

428
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,020
Because I signed, like, cause, like, you know.

429
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:14,340
Um, I've been always being like, oh, I don't really like some of this, like, there's been like a lack of good support skins.

430
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,400
I feel like the ones coming in for the next batch look really, really good.

431
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:20,860
Yeah, that's right.

432
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,600
I never read.

433
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,560
I just watch.

434
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,980
Oh, yeah, any buff invisible woman.

435
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,620
Her alt is better now.

436
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,200
Uh, she apparently...

437
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,080
Apparently her alt does...

438
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,540
It slows people down more.

439
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,040
I mean, we could try it out on these guys.

440
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,380
Holy shit.

441
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:41,980
Okay, wait.

442
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:42,980
Wait.

443
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,600
How slow are they?

444
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,060
I need to know.

445
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,460
Okay.

446
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,260
I can't...

447
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,760
They feel a lot slower.

448
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,140
Alright, let's try.

449
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,660
Let's try for these guys.

450
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,400
Oh!

451
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:04,940
Oh!

452
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,540
They feel a bit... Yeah, they feel a lot slower in general.

453
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:14,720
So apparently, they slowed down people inside the ult.

454
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:21,080
And they increased the healing, I believe, right?

455
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:28,180
I don't remember exactly the patch notes, but I think that was what they did.

456
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,660
And then you'll notice it when you're in a fight more.

457
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,160
I like this chain, the Jeff one.

458
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,660
But you have to remember where you are.

459
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,060
You can't flank alt now.

460
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,360
Oh, I can...

461
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,680
I didn't know that was the feature.

462
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,060
I usually never look at that.

463
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:47,620
Whoa.

464
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,900
Wait, I can do a top-down view?

465
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,060
Okay, I'd never pay attention to Jeff.

466
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,060
Yummy, yummy.

467
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,820
I clearly don't pay attention.

468
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,440
Yeah, the Jeff all heals.

469
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,260
Wait, oh my god, it heals so much.

470
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:02,860
Wait, you're right.

471
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,560
Wait, this heals so much.

472
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,380
I just noticed that.

473
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,140
Yummy, yummy.

474
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:11,980
Alright.

475
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:12,800
What else?

476
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,400
I think...

477
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,040
Is there any other changes that they did?

478
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,600
I know they nerfed Scylok.

479
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,980
Thank fucking God.

480
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,020
I'm so tired of Scylok.

481
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:21,720
Finally.

482
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,880
Finally, as a support player, I can finally fight back.

483
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,340
I say coping.

484
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,720
I say copingly.

485
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,400
I don't know what exactly they buffed.

486
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:33,880
But...

487
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,440
What exactly they nerfed.

488
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,040
But...

489
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:36,740
They nerfed something.

490
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,540
A true warrior is not defined by strength.

491
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,280
I can finally live an extra second, I say, as a coping support main.

492
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,520
A coping lunar support main.

493
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,760
That's even worse.

494
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,860
All the other support mains are like, you already have everything.

495
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,880
It's like, I want more.

496
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,500
Okay, so what is it?

497
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:00,920
This?

498
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,220
Oh, how far is it?

499
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:11,260
Wait, can I be like here and do it?

500
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,360
Oh, wait, that's so cool.

501
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,800
Okay, I have to hit someone.

502
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,560
Yeah, it's like, it's a dive.

503
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,980
So I have to hit someone to be able to do it.

504
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:33,100
Oh my god, imagine like a diving Thor is actually pretty scary.

505
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,740
Okay, if I can hit that.

506
00:40:36,760 --> 00:41:03,920
all right wait let's see if i can hit him oh it's a projectile though so that's like the worst part i'll get it eventually well it was only okay i think like an actual sword may will be able to hit that it's not me there you go oh wait there's a range oh there's a range oh thank god okay Okay,

507
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,460
thank God.

508
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:24,460
I was gonna say if I was Imagine if a Thor threw his spear From like spawn Like in the Thank God Imagine a Thor through his spear From spawn and just Threw straight down And it hits somebody And then you're like where the fuck did this guy come from Okay,

509
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:36,100
at least there's a range At least Yeah, a lion floor is already Pretty scary Okay All right, let's see.

510
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:37,620
Even that.

511
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,540
Oh, you can actually whiff the slam.

512
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,460
I wonder if, like, if they move.

513
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,140
Eee!

514
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:49,420
All right, wait, actually, how...

515
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:52,520
If they're moving, do I land on where they're going?

516
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:53,740
Or...

517
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,560
I don't know.

518
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,000
I can't tell yet.

519
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,860
I can't...

520
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,420
Oh, can someone walk in too?

521
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:36,180
it oh we can try the cooldown is crazy though it's like 22 seconds oh oh okay i can i can leap anywhere i don't have to hit it okay i actually oh i can use this to fast travel oh okay it was literally just range i can try fast travel with this i just gotta get closer there we go yeah it's an area it's not a character i think if it hits a character it travels with them.

522
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,000
I'm pretty sure.

523
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,080
I think that's what it means.

524
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,860
If you hit a character, it just travels with them.

525
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,400
If I hit it.

526
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,700
Guys, the only issue is that I have to hit it.

527
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,340
That's the only issue.

528
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,820
Look, I never said I was a projectile player.

529
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:52,760
There we go.

530
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,140
Yeah, it travels with him.

531
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:55,720
Yeah, see?

532
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,660
So if you hit it, it just... Yeah, you hit it.

533
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:04,000
If you hit it, you can travel with the spear.

534
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:38,860
range and it's pretty interesting these little changes every every half season you get a little something like a little surprise all right i think that's everything right or any other changes you don't have to run away from your past yeah it's good for if you're chasing someone if you hit it so so like if you hit them you can chase the squishies is there anything oh what the fuck where did you get that scar i can you tell me that story

535
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:49,040
hey girl you tell me the story how you got that scar at the local bar if you want

536
00:43:54,980 --> 00:44:06,680

537
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:09,140
Oh my god, we're perfect for each other.

538
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,640
Penny, spider drones, is that a new buff?

539
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,260
Oh my god, can Penny players finally play?

540
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:23,880
Oh wait, it's time, okay, I gotta, we gotta go, it's team time.

541
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:26,580

So it's going to be, I'm going to try my best.

544
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:53,070
That's, that's a little awkward.

545
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:54,690
It's, it's actually none of them.

546
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:56,670
I've never talked to any of them before.

547
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:58,330
So, whoa.

548
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:00,050

553
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:28,810
I'm muted, by the way.

00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:34,070
You know, actually, I think it was like six, seven days ago.

It's what map, what map do we go, bro?

557
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:36,310
Oh, whoa.

558
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,130
Wait, is the new map not in the game?

559
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:39,190
I don't think it is.

560
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:39,930
I don't see it.

561
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:44,650
Oh, yeah, the new map is like next, next month, apparently.

562
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:45,590
Okay, bye.

563
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:46,350
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:46,990
Sorry, next week.

565
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:47,510
Next month.

566
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:48,370
Hello, Doki.

567
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:49,010
Hello.

568
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:49,690
Hello, Doki.

569
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:50,450
Hello, hello.

570
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:51,350
Hello.

571
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:53,610
I think we just play any.

572
00:46:54,330 --> 00:47:25,170
listen all I know is that they they don't have a Venom Andrew on their team I'm going to have so much fun oh yeah no we will have a we should play Midtown who is the other guy yeah do you want to do Midtown or something yeah yeah yeah Midtown is so good Midtown bro you there Doki do you play Jeff uh I can try normally I don't play I don't play him either but I want to I want to test out his healing oh yeah get off the thing yes Jeff ulti now is nutter butters.

573
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:25,870
It looks cool.

574
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:28,590
So I actually, it's so funny.

575
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:32,650
I just saw this tech about like the 100 meter just starting to get by the way.

576
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:39,970
What people were doing, like, they were like old in their spawn with Jeff and then fly into the end of like the audio won't cue.

577
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:42,810
But now there's no reason to do that if the healing isn't going to drop.

578
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:48,350
So you want to Thor and all Angela first one and then you can swap it?

579
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:49,290
Yes, sir.

580
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:53,610
I'm going to try to kidnap X and just pull the pack.

581
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:54,610
out of him.

582
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:55,250
Hey, Yaman.

583
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:56,210
What the heck out of that guy?

584
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:57,170
The heck out of him, dude.

585
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:04,650
I'm so glad you were practicing your Thor thing, because now, like, this is a massive combo right here.

586
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:06,050
Yeah, you're Wombo-Tomba together.

587
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:06,950
You guys got to plan it.

588
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:15,150
I'm so happy we're playing Midtown, because the last preview, we made everybody play Midtown six times in a row, and XPC was in there.

589
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:16,570
I actually like this map.

590
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:21,330
Oh, yeah, I like this map here, actually.

Yeah, but like, do you have wings?

593
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:56,070
I don't think so.

594
00:48:57,830 --> 00:48:58,490
Ninja screen.

595
00:48:58,950 --> 00:48:59,550
I already got it.

596
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:00,250
Got it.

00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:01,070
Got it.

599
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:01,070
Already.

600
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:02,230
Come on, I'm a professional, bro.

601
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:04,410
I feel like I'm going to push the card.

602
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:05,750
They're coming up top, probably.

603
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:06,390
This character, bro.

604
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:11,010
Oh, yeah.

605
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:12,570
I got the floor here.

606
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:12,950
Oh, my God.

607
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:17,210
I'm just flying away.

608
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:18,770
We're going to back up for now.

609
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:19,670
My last is we got point.

610
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:26,910
I pulled the floor.

611
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:29,590
Oh, there's a scooter man.

612
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:34,030
Oh, I got you.

613
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:34,850
I'm in there.

614
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:35,790
I'm gone.

615
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:38,570
Big heals coming in, Craig.

616
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:39,450
Big heals, brother.

617
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:41,490
Yeah, you'll never die.

618
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:44,670
I'm going to try to keep that back.

619
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:45,910
Moon Knight's onk is yellow.

620
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:46,690
Look at Thor.

621
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:47,810
I think it's the mecha.

622
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:48,550
Oh, yeah.

623
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:49,970
I'm bringing it back here.

624
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:52,990
Oh, I need help.

625
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:53,490

Big heals.

629
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:56,190
Protect our heal.

630
00:49:57,590 --> 00:49:57,930
Nice.

631
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:58,470
Nice.

632
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:00,170
Wait, yo.

633
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:01,330
These yellow hunts are sick.

634
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:02,670
Can you guys get in my E really quick?

635
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:03,090

Oh, is this gold?

638
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:07,510
Oh, that's yep.

639
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:08,570
No.

640
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:09,890
Do you run faster in it too?

641
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:10,510
No.

642
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:13,090
It's just like aesthetic.

643
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:15,550
They're behind us.

644
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:17,710
Oh, I can't even pull that.

645
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:20,870
Oh, I need help.

646
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:21,270
I need help.

647
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:22,190
There's a Thor on us.

648
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:22,630
Oh, I'm low too.

649
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:25,170
Oh, I'm getting harassed.

00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:12,890
Oh, Scarlet low, Sky low.

Sky?

690
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:19,990
I went too deep.

691
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:20,870
I tried to bully X.

692
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:21,650
I went too deep.

693
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:22,650
I tried to bully X.

694
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:24,010
Oh, my God, that was sick.

695
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:25,730
At least he didn't kill you.

696
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:30,790
That is so dope, bro.

697
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:32,490

698
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:35,190
Oh, I don't see you.

699
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:35,530
I got you.

700
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:37,850
I feel like I can get back there in the past, too.

701
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:38,970
Wait, I'm going in with all of you.

702
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:40,330
Can I get some bubbles?

703
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:42,170
Yeah, bubbles going in.

704
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:43,330
Oh, God, I got kidnapped.

00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:50,050
Oh, oh.

712
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:56,650

713
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:57,550

Oh, nice heals.

00:52:59,070 --> 00:52:59,730
I'm getting healed.

716
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:00,370

717
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:01,810
I don't know where to take them!

718
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:02,330
Oh!

719
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:03,890
Go back, go back, go back!

720
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:05,270
Just take them to the room!

721
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:05,890
Look at the house!

722
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:06,350
Look at the house!

723
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:07,010
We'll beat them up in the house!

724
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:10,310
There you go!

00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:12,810
Nice!

727
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:14,730
Wait, Jeff main in the making.

728
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:16,390
Yeah, I think Jeff is better.

729
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:19,030
Oh, there's a wolf behind you guys.

730
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:19,590
Wolf behind you guys.

731
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:20,090
He's in this house.

732
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:22,410
Get him, Timmy.

733
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:23,690
Yeah, I am.

734
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:26,010
Down to three.

735
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:27,550
Down to three.

736
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:28,950
What if I could stop TP?

737
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:30,690
Dude, that was actually so sick, Craig.

738
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:31,270
Yeah, absolutely.

739
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:32,310
That was crazy.

740
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:34,610
Hang on for just feeling fantastic.

741
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:37,710
Oh, wow.

742
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:38,990
I don't think I'm going to grab him.

743
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:39,670
Sue brings me down.

744
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:43,430
I'm going to try to kidnap Xs all.

745
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:43,810

746
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:47,190
Oh, I got changed.

Oh, I hear him again, bro.

751
00:53:54,410 --> 00:53:54,810
Magic.

752
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:57,350
Magic behind us low.

753
00:53:58,710 --> 00:53:59,110

00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:06,410
Magic for sure.

757
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:08,430
Oh, he is not dead.

758
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:09,490
No, no, it's a Jeff.

759
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:11,770
Oh, oh, okay.

Why is Moxie on Spider-Man, bro?

00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:19,290
We didn't push that, can we?

827
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:20,950
Spider-Man weak still.

828
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:21,530
I need heal.

829
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:21,930
I need us.

830
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:22,190
Thank you.

831
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:22,490
I got you.

832
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:23,010
Got you.

833
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:23,270
Got you.

834
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:23,690
Okay.

835
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:26,810
Spider-Man, I'm going Spider-Man against him.

836
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:29,670
One blade.

837
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:32,290
Wait, Susan Viz.

838
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:33,630
Where'd she just go?

839
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:35,630
Listen for her footsteps.

840
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:36,730
Yep, quiet.

841
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:38,750
Oh, there's a Spider-Man here.

842
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:39,930
I smell her?

843
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:43,070
Mark Spider-Man right here?

844
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:45,510
I'm cooked, I'm cooked.

845
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:48,230
Bro, how are you supposed to hit a Spider-Man that knows what they're doing?

846
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:48,790
Like, actually.

847
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:50,190
Oh, I gotta get out.

848
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:52,990
He's trying to kill me.

849
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:56,970
Oh, I got you.

850
00:58:57,590 --> 00:58:58,470
I'm using my luck.

851
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:00,050
Love y'all.

852
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:00,870
I got one.

853
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:01,490
I got one.

854
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:02,090
I got one.

855
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:02,550
All right.

856
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:03,330
You two, you two.

857
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:04,990
No, I'm gone too here.

858
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:05,870
I'm on the point.

859
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:06,590
But I might die.

860
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:07,910
You want to combo it?

861
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:09,550
Hell yeah, bro.

862
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:10,270
You guys have no healers.

863
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:10,670
You just wait.

864
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:11,470
All right.

865
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:12,610
Oh, we are.

866
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:17,190
They use Invisal for that.

867
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:19,770
Yep.

868
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:20,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

869
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:23,890
I think they have like every other alt impossible though.

870
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:26,130
I'm ready to dive.

871
00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:28,330
You got, you got to get in there and get ready.

872
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:29,210
All right.

873
00:59:29,230 --> 00:59:30,510
I'm ready last.

874
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:31,530
I'm gonna try to do it.

875
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:33,250
I'm on Spider-Man.

876
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:34,330
For the cinema.

877
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:36,570
Come with the healers.

878
00:59:37,330 --> 00:59:38,250
Oh shit!

879
00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:39,790
Oh they did to us.

880
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:42,330
Oh my god that's a lot of damage.

881
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:43,910
Oh my goodness.

882
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,490
That is a lot of damage.

883
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:48,390
I think we're dead.

884
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:48,870
I'm also.

885
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:51,290
Nah it's gotta be doable.

886
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:53,650
I don't think this is...

887
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:55,370
It's winnable.

888
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:55,710
It's winnable.

889
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:56,670
It's just two.

890
00:59:57,070 --> 00:59:57,450

You can take people off the map in this last.

916
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:06,770
This would be sick.

917
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:07,810

Oh.

925
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:20,270

Oh, strange half.

930
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:26,370
Strange low.

931
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:26,770
Strange low.

932
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:28,130
I'm just beating him up.

933
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:28,990
Nice.

Oh, you got him, Greg.

937
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:35,970
Yeah, yeah.

938
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:36,590
Don't get pulled.

939
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:39,090
Last, let's try and do the combo with this choke, yeah?

940
01:02:39,610 --> 01:02:39,970
Yes, sir.

941
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:40,350
Yes, sir.

942
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:42,850
Oh, I'm short of breath on that one.

943
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:45,710
Last, did you use your C into it or did you just alt into it?

944
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:49,190
I see it into it and then I drop my E and then I ulti.

945
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:54,130
All right.

946
01:02:54,310 --> 01:02:56,550
I'm gonna throw mine in there with you guys.

947
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:57,810
Oh, Tim!

948
01:02:58,250 --> 01:02:58,490
Oh, Tim!

949
01:02:58,490 --> 01:02:58,610
Oh, you left!

950
01:02:59,230 --> 01:02:59,970
Nice play to me.

951
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:02,390
Oh, you just killed everyone.

952
01:03:02,590 --> 01:03:02,770
Never mind.

953
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:05,010
Oh my god, you all live.

954
01:03:05,810 --> 01:03:08,270
You tried to take me off the bat, dude.

955
01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:09,950
Bro, that was so good.

956
01:03:10,430 --> 01:03:10,830
Oh god.

957
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:11,850
I got you?

958
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:13,130
Oh, never mind.

959
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:13,610
I lied.

960
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:14,850
I'm booty.

961
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:15,290
I'm gone.

962
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:19,290
I'm gone.

963
01:03:19,450 --> 01:03:19,670
Goodbye.

964
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:22,770
I was in the wrong form, dude.

965
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:27,390
This map is going to be so troll.

966
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:28,830
I ulted as well.

967
01:03:29,230 --> 01:03:29,730
I got three.

968
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:31,070
I got three.

969
01:03:31,810 --> 01:03:32,850
I'm saving.

970
01:03:33,330 --> 01:03:33,790
Oh my God.

971
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:35,690
I got three.

972
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:36,410
I got three.

973
01:03:37,570 --> 01:03:37,970
Goodbye.

974
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:39,390
Big fish.

975
01:03:39,730 --> 01:03:40,230
Oh, goodbye, Jay.

976
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:40,870
You can jump.

977
01:03:41,830 --> 01:03:44,470
It's my turn to take people off the gift.

978
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:46,590
That was so good.

979
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:48,930
I didn't, I was like worried.

980
01:03:49,070 --> 01:03:50,290
I don't know, I don't know how good is healing.

981
01:03:50,390 --> 01:03:52,210
So I double ulted as well, even in the pool.

982
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:55,910
I think it's like, I think you definitely won't survive.

983
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:58,910
Like really, you can over, you can over commit very easily.

984
01:03:59,230 --> 01:03:59,850
Sure can.

985
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:01,050
You just get so excited.

986
01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:04,250
And fall.

987
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:09,450
Bubbles to escape.

988
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:14,830
Guys, he wants to win.

989
01:04:16,530 --> 01:04:17,690
No, my dog!

990
01:04:18,530 --> 01:04:19,790
My dog wants food!

991
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:23,390
Oh my god, I'm so slow!

992
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:24,450
I got a rod of the ult.

993
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:31,230
Oh, come on.

994
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:33,730
He wants food.

995
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:35,390
I can't talk!

996
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:38,130
I can't capture him!

997
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:38,610
I froze her!

998
01:04:38,930 --> 01:04:38,930
I'm out!

999
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:40,170
I can't feed him!

1000
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:41,190
We're fighting!

1001
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:42,370
You can hear him!

1002
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:44,670
He came!

1003
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:46,110
Oh, we get closer!

1004
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:48,210
Please!

1005
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:50,670
I'm going in.

1006
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:51,350
I'm going to capture him.

1007
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:51,730
Please!

1008
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:52,750
I'm fucking...

1009
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:53,270
Oh my god.

1010
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:53,790
Hold on.

1011
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:54,510
I thought something happened.

1012
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:57,310
I'm at work!

1013
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:00,150
I got Wolf 2.

1014
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:05,550
Oh my.

1015
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:08,530
Oh my, I see all this.

1016
01:05:09,450 --> 01:05:09,610
Yeah.

1017
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:10,650
One shot super nice.

1018
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:14,450
Invisible one shot on point somewhere.

1019
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:17,610
Oh my God, he came closer.

1020
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:18,630
No!

1021
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:21,750
No, the aim is coming on point one.

1022
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:22,970
I got to get him fast.

1023
01:05:25,510 --> 01:05:26,510
Wow, was that really necessary?

1024
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:27,630
Sure was.

1025
01:05:28,010 --> 01:05:28,690
Oh, yeah.

1026
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:31,790
Nah, he's looking good, looking good.

1027
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:34,250
I gotta showcase that Angela.

1028
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:34,890
Oh my God.

1029
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:37,590
Dude, that must have been so fun for her, bro.

1030
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:39,010
Oh my God.

1031
01:05:39,530 --> 01:05:41,470
Bro, he got me in three.

1032
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:43,950
That map is going to turn in two hours early.

1033
01:05:44,150 --> 01:05:45,530
Because he knows that map works.

1034
01:05:46,090 --> 01:05:48,070
Spider-Man's pulling people off the map.

1035
01:05:48,390 --> 01:05:49,730
Fuckies, Wolverines.

1036
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:52,410
He got his food two hours early.

1037
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:54,910
This fucking dog is...

1038
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:55,310

You're not taking damage.

1046
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:36,750
Hit me with it.

1047
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:37,350
All right, go ahead, Rip.

01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:40,250

1050
01:07:42,510 --> 01:07:44,890
Yo, Jay, Jay, you can take them off the map.

1051
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:46,970
Bro, fly from behind right here.

1052
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:48,230
Let's move up.

1053
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:49,010
Oh, that's true.

1054
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:49,990
Yeah, we gotta move up.

1055
01:07:50,310 --> 01:07:50,410
Yeah, we gotta move up.

1056
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:52,310
Right here, stick them and throw them off the map.

1057
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:53,170
Left click at the end.

1058
01:07:53,290 --> 01:07:54,190
Oh my god, this is gonna be insane.

1059
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:56,410
Bro, this is clipping here if you can pull this off.

1060
01:07:56,790 --> 01:07:58,590
If I miss, I'm gonna feel bad.

1061
01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:00,830
I got you.

1062
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:01,350
I got you.

1063
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:01,790
I got you.

1064
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:02,710
Hit me with it.

1065
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:03,030
They don't know.

1066
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:03,930
They don't know.

1067
01:08:03,930 --> 01:08:04,170
Oh, God.

1068
01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:05,270
You move that way.

1069
01:08:06,130 --> 01:08:07,670
Oh, shit.

1070
01:08:09,350 --> 01:08:10,150
We can't.

1071
01:08:10,310 --> 01:08:10,670
Oh, my God.

1072
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:11,230
You can't go straight.

1073
01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:13,510
Oh, I got fooled by the water.

1074
01:08:13,930 --> 01:08:15,290
Oh, good grease wall.

1075
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:15,870
The coast.

1076
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:18,370
You're the only tank, by the way, Jay.

1077
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:19,170
Goodbye, everybody.

1078
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:20,890
I got group.

1079
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:25,490
I'm the...

1080
01:08:25,490 --> 01:08:26,370
Where's Moxie?

1081
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:27,010
Moxie above a sign of it.

1082
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:28,530
Oh, he was shooting me.

1083
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:29,170
Oh, I'm getting shot.

1084
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:29,970
from behind.

1085
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:31,410
Wait, he's one?

1086
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:32,070
He's one, one, one.

1087
01:08:32,410 --> 01:08:32,410
Nice.

1088
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:36,430
I'm clapping.

1089
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:39,110
I can pull someone in a second.

1090
01:08:40,590 --> 01:08:43,230
I think I get healed in my shift form now, which is insane.

1091
01:08:43,530 --> 01:08:44,890
Dude, switch is insane.

1092
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:45,570
Wanda's insane.

1093
01:08:46,230 --> 01:08:46,890
Oh, I got the new character.

1094
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:49,150
Oh, you're well now?

1095
01:08:49,610 --> 01:08:50,030
You're trapped.

1096
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:50,310
You're trapped.

1097
01:08:50,370 --> 01:08:50,610
You're well.

1098
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:51,170
You're all you want.

1099
01:08:51,370 --> 01:08:52,050
Oh, you're okay.

1100
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:53,610
You're so healthy.

1101
01:08:54,110 --> 01:08:56,230
You're so healthy.

1102
01:08:57,910 --> 01:09:00,170
I'm not having fun I immediately shifted him.

1103
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:00,710
Oh, Gru what?

1104
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:01,490
Oh, never mind.

1105
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:02,290
He's getting healed.

1106
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:03,190
Why I'm pulling?

1107
01:09:03,690 --> 01:09:05,050
Oh, no, I missed my push.

1108
01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:05,950
Missed my push.

1109
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:06,390
That's fine.

1110
01:09:06,490 --> 01:09:07,130
We can wait a bit here.

1111
01:09:07,930 --> 01:09:08,730
Throwing another shift.

1112
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:10,550
Oh, nice.

1113
01:09:11,490 --> 01:09:12,530
Pulling in one second.

1114
01:09:13,170 --> 01:09:13,710
I'm a bit low.

1115
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:15,250
I'm pulling Gru.

1116
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:16,650
All right, Walt.

1117
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:17,270
Easy.

1118
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:17,290
Easy.

1119
01:09:17,310 --> 01:09:17,570
What?

1120
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:20,510
Oh, you almost got him.

1121
01:09:20,510 --> 01:09:21,430
He had more HP.

1122
01:09:23,850 --> 01:09:25,490
Oh, he's just, how did you bomb it?

1123
01:09:25,510 --> 01:09:26,210
How did you bomb it?

1124
01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:27,870
I didn't hit it.

1125
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:28,810
Damn it.

1126
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:30,090
I froze.

1127
01:09:30,610 --> 01:09:31,570
I got the Hulk out in.

1128
01:09:31,970 --> 01:09:32,830
Wait, I'll ult first.

1129
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:34,090
Are you all first?

1130
01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:34,910
I'm okay.

1131
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:35,950
Okay, never mind.

1132
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:36,730
I got a second.

1133
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:37,530
I'm pulling XECN.

1134
01:09:38,310 --> 01:09:39,530
Yeah, pulling him in even further.

1135
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:40,070
Nice.

1136
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:41,450
Oh my god, 4X, dude.

1141
01:09:46,870 --> 01:09:48,370
I'm gonna ult towards the end of this.

1142
01:09:48,430 --> 01:09:48,750
That's a good ult.

1143
01:09:48,850 --> 01:09:49,570
That's a really good jump.

1144
01:09:49,690 --> 01:09:50,330
Okay, I'm in the...

1145
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:51,010

Okay, okay.

He's done.

1215
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:48,280
Moxie trying to pull off my right click.

1216
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:48,860
Come on now.

1217
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,180
Oh, do you need help over there?

1218
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:52,840

Okay.

01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:54,600
I have my own here for you almost.

1221
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,620
You got the sim.

1222
01:13:58,760 --> 01:13:59,260
One kill.

1223
01:13:59,660 --> 01:13:59,800
Oh!

1224
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:01,440
You did it!

1225
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:02,240
Bang!

1226
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:06,540
And then, wait, Ninja, how do you die?

1227
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:07,520
I got pulled.

1228
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:09,700
Oh, there are more on top?

1229
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:11,980
Oh, no, like in front of us?

1230
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:13,340
On all of us, dude.

1231
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,020
That was actually sick.

1232
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:16,360
Yeah, I'm about to ult.

1233
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:16,920
Can I get heals?

1234
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:18,720
Wait, Ninja, you want to combo?

1235
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:20,220
I would love to.

1236
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:21,100
What do we combo in, brother?

1237
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:23,080
I'm stuck in that.

1238
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,440
I'm stuck in that.

1239
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:26,180
I saw it's all of them in the...

1240
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:27,540
Oh, they support ult you.

1241
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:28,160
That's not you.

1242
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:29,240
Are you still ulting?

1243
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:30,680
Wait, she's so slow.

1244
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:32,200
Nice.

1245
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:33,940
Come on now.

1246
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:35,160
Yeah, you out damaged Luno.

1247
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:37,020
Oh, we love it.

1248
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:39,660
Mox is trying to kill me again, dude.

1249
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,520
You already got me once, dude.

1250
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:44,900
The PTSD.

1251
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:47,200
Holy, dude.

1252
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:50,260
If you stay in a turret form, you can never get pulled.

1253
01:14:50,540 --> 01:14:51,700
I'm never going to get off this.

1254
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:53,220
I need all your shields.

1255
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:55,820
I just got two tab by Super Bro.

1256
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:56,780
Oh, my God.

1257
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,180
Only 60 seconds left.

1258
01:14:59,220 --> 01:14:59,820
That's my Wanda.

1259
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:02,880
I got one of the healers.

1260
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:04,040
He embarrass me.

1261
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:04,380
He does.

1262
01:15:05,180 --> 01:15:05,980
See, he can't pull you.

1263
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:06,680
Oh, now he can.

1264
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:08,240
Angela is it?

1265
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:09,640
I got you.

1266
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:11,140
Don't worry.

1267
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:12,180
We actually love that.

1268
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,220
I'm going for him.

1269
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:13,760
I'm going for him.

1270
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:14,120
Don't worry.

1271
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:15,100
I knocked him down.

1272
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:16,500
The right click's actually so good.

1273
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:16,940
He's one shot.

1274
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,020
Bro, he's so fast.

1275
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:18,420
Yes.

1276
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:21,100
He makes fast people look not fast.

1277
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:22,460
Doesn't grab up?

1278
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:27,660
There's a group up.

1279
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:27,960
There's a group on the right.

1280
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:28,580
There's groups on the right.

1281
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:30,240
He might try to solo this.

1282
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:31,540
Yeah.

1283
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:33,980
He's not having a good time.

1284
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:34,760
Wait, did you see him?

1285
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:35,900
He's over here somewhere.

1286
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:37,280
Oh, he's...

1287
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:38,660
He's like, dude, I need some ammo, dude.

1288
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:39,400
I need some ammo.

1289
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:40,200
We're gonna mama combo.

1290
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:40,960
I'm on the blink.

1291
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:43,520
I'm stuck.

1292
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:44,180
Stop.

1293
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:45,360
What the fuck?

1294
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:47,120
Hey, you're toxic, bro.

1295
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:49,820
Hey, guys, here comes, here comes, here comes.

1296
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:50,200
I want my combo.

1297
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:51,960
Wait, what?

1298
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:52,780
I do what?

1299
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:53,580
I'm on the way.

1300
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:54,380
I'm on the way.

1301
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:54,680
Here we go.

1302
01:15:57,380 --> 01:15:58,200
Dude, I'm getting caught.

1303
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:58,520
Oh, no.

1304
01:15:58,600 --> 01:15:59,800
The wall blocks it, man.

1305
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:02,520
Oh.

1306
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:02,880
Oh.

1307
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:03,360
Oh, nice.

1308
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:06,200
How do we learn?

1309
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:07,180
We're a resin dude.

1310
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:09,700
Just get out of here, Jay.

1311
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:10,980
Yeah, get out of here.

1312
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:12,360
Oh, Shay got pulled.

1313
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:14,520
What is Tyler's cross, sir?

1314
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:15,420
Oh, my God.

1315
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:16,540
It's actually amazing.

1316
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:17,340
You can see my body.

1317
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:18,580
I don't think so much damage is crazy.

1318
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:19,560
I got you moving speed.

1319
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:20,440
Go, go, go, go, go.

1320
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:21,100
Oh, my God, Dad.

1321
01:16:24,510 --> 01:16:25,470
You're so fast.

1322
01:16:25,770 --> 01:16:26,910
I've still got songs to see.

1323
01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:29,190
Good tea.

1324
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:31,270
Good tea.

1325
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:32,110

He's aura farming.

1331
01:18:07,610 --> 01:18:08,150
He's aura farming right now.

1332
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:09,070
Let him aura farm.

1333
01:18:09,870 --> 01:18:10,570
Hold on.

1334
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:10,950
Hold on.

1335
01:18:11,150 --> 01:18:11,550
It's on.

1336
01:18:11,590 --> 01:18:11,850
It's on PC.

1337
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:13,390
Someone to like the edge.

1338
01:18:13,530 --> 01:18:13,990
What is it?

1339
01:18:14,170 --> 01:18:14,770
How do you do it?

1340
01:18:15,050 --> 01:18:17,670
You have to bind it in your key key binds.

1341
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:21,150
It says settings, key binds and then down to movement.

1342
01:18:21,370 --> 01:18:22,010
It's slow walk.

1343
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:23,730
It's working to the strength.

1344
01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:25,210
Super distraction is working.

1345
01:18:25,630 --> 01:18:26,550
What the heck happened?

1346
01:18:26,810 --> 01:18:28,770
You guys gotta do better in the front line, dude.

1347
01:18:29,110 --> 01:18:29,790
You guys gotta do better.

1348
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:30,410
Oh, there.

1349
01:18:32,090 --> 01:18:32,310
Aren't you?

1350
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:34,270
Are you guys aura farming right now?

1351
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:35,410
Yeah, we're all aura farming.

1352
01:18:35,630 --> 01:18:37,110
Wait, they're farming you.

1353
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:39,090
You're also farming you.

1354
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:42,650
Okay, dude.

1355
01:18:42,770 --> 01:18:43,010
All right.

1356
01:18:44,070 --> 01:18:44,510
Okay, dude.

1357
01:18:44,810 --> 01:18:46,090
Now we finally...

1358
01:18:48,030 --> 01:18:49,130
All bets are off.

1359
01:18:49,210 --> 01:18:49,770

1362

I got bubbles on the middle of the point.

01:20:35,450 --> 01:20:36,750
Oh, I think I might die.

1370
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:37,750
I'm all over the bubbles.

1371
01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:39,390
I'm dancing on the bubbles right now.

1372
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:43,570
That's so much damage.

1373
01:20:43,930 --> 01:20:44,990
Nice, nice, nice.

1374
01:20:47,070 --> 01:20:47,990
Are you guys winning?

01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:50,070
Yeah, we're winning, son.

01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:51,490
Nice.

1377

No way they portal, right?

1379
01:20:54,770 --> 01:20:55,750
Moxie's portaling for him.

1380
01:20:56,170 --> 01:20:57,510
Wait, wait, I got freeze ready.

1381
01:20:58,550 --> 01:21:00,270
Wait, I'll dash through the portal and try to push him off.

1382
01:21:00,470 --> 01:21:01,490
He's a slow poke.

1383
01:21:01,490 --> 01:21:02,150
Oh, he missed.

1384
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:03,270
I still got to freeze.

1385
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:06,410
I'm getting Muxia.

1386
01:21:06,450 --> 01:21:07,390
I'm getting Muxia out.

1387
01:21:07,430 --> 01:21:07,750
Nice.

1388
01:21:08,410 --> 01:21:08,950
Wait, wait, wait.

1389
01:21:09,050 --> 01:21:09,590
Go through the portal.

1390
01:21:09,810 --> 01:21:10,130
Wait, there's one.

1391
01:21:10,390 --> 01:21:10,790
Go in there.

1392
01:21:10,850 --> 01:21:11,310
Go in there.

1393
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:11,470
Go in there.

1394
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:13,470
I'm frozen right now.

1395
01:21:15,710 --> 01:21:16,810
I believe in yes.

1396
01:21:16,990 --> 01:21:17,710
I'll push the cart.

1397
01:21:18,050 --> 01:21:18,870
I think she got, she got me.

1398
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:19,230
I'm targeting.

1399
01:21:19,810 --> 01:21:20,410
Oh, my God.

1400
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:21,790
Wow, that is toxic, bro.

1401
01:21:22,530 --> 01:21:22,890
Oh, dude.

1402
01:21:23,110 --> 01:21:23,630
Sikuno's here.

1403
01:21:24,670 --> 01:21:27,510
I think they didn't realize they could go to, like, the other lobby.

1404
01:21:27,910 --> 01:21:28,810
Can they go to the other lobby?

1405
01:21:28,990 --> 01:21:29,550
Can they go to the swap swans?

1406
01:21:30,930 --> 01:21:31,690
Oh, no.

1407
01:21:32,710 --> 01:21:33,090
Oh, no.

1408
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:34,090
Oh, that's toxic, bro.

1409
01:21:34,630 --> 01:21:35,250
It's a penny angle.

1410
01:21:37,190 --> 01:21:39,550
I think he's all got a buff, right, or something.

1411
01:21:41,370 --> 01:21:42,650
She like had her kits slightly.

1412
01:21:43,030 --> 01:21:43,390
I thought Penny did.

1413
01:21:43,730 --> 01:21:45,070
Yeah, no, Penny did get them.

1414
01:21:45,570 --> 01:21:46,950
She spawned more mines now.

1415
01:21:47,450 --> 01:21:51,110
It is insane that you can heal Wanda in her shift now.

1416
01:21:51,470 --> 01:21:52,170
Wait, Groot's low.

1417
01:21:52,570 --> 01:21:52,850
Oh, he lives.

1418
01:21:52,930 --> 01:21:53,390
Yeah, I know.

1419
01:21:53,470 --> 01:21:54,130
I got him so weak.

1420
01:21:56,770 --> 01:21:57,290
Oh, wait.

1421
01:21:57,650 --> 01:21:58,490
Angela on us.

1422
01:21:59,470 --> 01:21:59,670
Bye.

1423
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:01,090
Let me help.

1424
01:22:03,290 --> 01:22:04,090
I'm walking.

1425
01:22:04,630 --> 01:22:05,110
I'm walking.

1426
01:22:06,710 --> 01:22:07,890
Oh, I know it's death.

1427
01:22:09,730 --> 01:22:11,210
Oh, wait.

1428
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:12,830
Oh, wait.

1429
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:14,950
Catch the dog.

1430
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:16,650
I still got songs to sing.

1431
01:22:16,970 --> 01:22:17,930
You will never know.

1432
01:22:18,130 --> 01:22:19,130
And we're going to have the combo here.

1433
01:22:19,290 --> 01:22:19,890
So hit me.

1434
01:22:20,210 --> 01:22:20,730
Be safe.

1435
01:22:21,130 --> 01:22:21,410
Don't worry.

1436
01:22:21,450 --> 01:22:22,090
We're coming back.

1437
01:22:22,290 --> 01:22:22,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1438
01:22:22,710 --> 01:22:23,230
Live, live last.

1439
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:23,570
No.

1440
01:22:25,070 --> 01:22:25,890
If you can peek me.

1441
01:22:26,010 --> 01:22:27,530
I can hit them close to an edge so you can like play the corner.

1442
01:22:27,850 --> 01:22:28,430
Yeah, I'm going to, yeah.

1443
01:22:28,730 --> 01:22:29,310
That's the hardest part.

1444
01:22:29,330 --> 01:22:29,930
I ignored there.

1445
01:22:30,710 --> 01:22:31,990
Let me know when you do it, Jett.

1446
01:22:32,210 --> 01:22:32,990
Okay, I'm looking.

1447
01:22:33,070 --> 01:22:34,090
I'm looking in main right now.

1448
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:36,010
It's a big one.

1449
01:22:36,170 --> 01:22:36,530
This?

1450
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:41,170
There's a jet behind us.

1451
01:22:41,390 --> 01:22:41,770
Oh, not Jeff.

1452
01:22:42,010 --> 01:22:42,230
Oh, dude.

1453
01:22:43,610 --> 01:22:44,550
Oh, my God.

1454
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:45,530
She froze me.

1455
01:22:46,830 --> 01:22:47,990
I can't see back.

1456
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:48,390
Don't hate it.

1457
01:22:48,410 --> 01:22:48,790
Don't hate it.

1458
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:49,150
Don't hate it.

1459
01:22:49,230 --> 01:22:49,490
I'm coming.

1460
01:22:52,070 --> 01:22:54,630
Four, three, two, one.

1461
01:22:55,810 --> 01:22:56,510
Oh, I missed this.

1462
01:22:56,610 --> 01:22:57,150
I missed this.

1463
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:57,810
Oh, nice.

1464
01:22:57,930 --> 01:22:58,290
Nice.

1465
01:22:58,870 --> 01:22:59,190
I live.

1466
01:23:00,610 --> 01:23:01,530
Get him off the map.

1467
01:23:01,570 --> 01:23:02,110
Get him off the map.

1468
01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:05,730
I hate so many people.

1469
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:06,290
I didn't know how to.

1470
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:07,250
I keep you up.

1471
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:07,970
No, I quit.

1472
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:08,470
Keep you up.

1473
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:13,040
Oh no.

1474
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:13,760
Oh, they're dying.

1475
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:17,180
He's got the wrong people.

1476
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:17,580
He's one.

1477
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:17,960
He's one.

1478
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:18,700
That grid's one.

1479
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:24,940
I'm stuck.

1480
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:25,500
I'm stuck.

1481
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:25,660
I'm stuck.

1482
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:26,100
I'm stuck.

1483
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:26,780
Oh my goodness.

1484
01:23:27,020 --> 01:23:27,900
I got grimsters.

1485
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:31,260
She tethered me and I couldn't fly.

1486
01:23:32,580 --> 01:23:33,340
Damn it.

1487
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:34,020
Are you okay?

1488
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:35,880
She tethered me.

1489
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:37,500
me and I couldn't fly.

1490
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:46,120
Oh, I'm just chunking you off the map when you res.

1491
01:23:46,460 --> 01:23:47,540
I saw that.

1492
01:23:47,540 --> 01:23:49,880
I saw you like beating him up in the corner.

1493
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:51,840
Why not point playing?

1494
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:52,400
I'm point selling.

1495
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:53,740
Is that Andrew on point?

1496
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:56,080
Yes.

1497
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:57,180
Oh, look.

1498
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:58,100
No.

1499
01:23:58,720 --> 01:23:59,260
Oh, I got you guys.

1500
01:23:59,360 --> 01:23:59,840
I got you guys.

1501
01:24:00,180 --> 01:24:00,620
I got bubbles.

1502
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:01,240
I got bubbles.

1503
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:04,040
I got them.

1504
01:24:04,460 --> 01:24:04,980
I have to.

1505
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:05,780
Oh, they still got it again.

1506
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:07,400
They see nine, two, nine, two, nine, bro.

1507
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,480
They see nine again.

1508
01:24:11,740 --> 01:24:11,920
Nice.

1509
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:15,440
That's what I'm talking about.

1510
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:16,720
Give up Vellanda, Tim.

1511
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:18,080
Guys, I have thrived.

1512
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:20,860
This is like my first full game on this character.

1513
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:21,840
I'm learning, all right?

1514
01:24:21,940 --> 01:24:22,840
Hey, bro, hang up the.

1515
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:24,060
Hang it up, dude.

1516
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:25,500
Yeah, I mean, Ninja's top frag.

1517
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:26,580
Come on, bro.

1518
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:28,940
Okay, shouldn't you be top frag with your high fob?

1519
01:24:29,420 --> 01:24:29,700
All right.

1520
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:31,380
Moon Knight is not my main character.

1521
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:32,900
He's on Moon Knight.

1522
01:24:33,980 --> 01:24:34,480
Okay, okay.

1523
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:37,600
I'm blanking, I'm blanking, I'm blanking.

1524
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:38,660
They don't know.

1525
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:41,000
Jay, oh my god.

1526
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:42,120
Oh my god.

1527
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:43,440
Oh my god.

1528
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:44,040
You just hold back.

1529
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:44,560
You're hilarious.

1530
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:45,900
Dude, super is nice.

1531
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:46,980
That's crazy.

1532
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:48,640
I'm ready to put on a show.

1533
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:50,940
I have an Angela on me.

1534
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:52,120
He's on the cart.

1535
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:55,260
I'm just farming my old and that old Jay, by the way.

1536
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:55,840
That was insane.

1537
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:56,300
Oh, you're good.

1538
01:24:57,060 --> 01:24:57,600
Good stuff.

1539
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:03,580
Okay, they might have a...

1540
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:04,140
Oh, never mind.

1541
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:04,980
Oh, he's dead.

1542
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:05,680
Oh, he's dead.

1543
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:07,660
You make one shot!

1544
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:08,480
I frozen?

1545
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:09,160
Wait.

1546
01:25:09,820 --> 01:25:12,680
Adam Orlac is like the greatest solo player of all time.

1547
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:14,280
We have like six ultimates, by the way.

1548
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:14,860
This is insane.

1549
01:25:16,540 --> 01:25:16,900
Wait.

1550
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:19,040
We'll do you, you, you default first, you go ahead.

1551
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:24,060
Bro, if you could, Jeffel, grab all of them and then just like, I'll throw my ult.

1552
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:25,340
Yeah, they're all fighting in there anyway.

1553
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:26,360
Oh, I fell down.

1554
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:26,660
I fell down.

1555
01:25:26,780 --> 01:25:27,440
You fell!

1556
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:32,080
Oh, you didn't stop that.

1557
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:32,380
What?

1558
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:32,940
That's...

1559
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:33,240
Wow.

1560
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:34,560
Wait, that's good.

1561
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:34,860
That's good.

1562
01:25:34,940 --> 01:25:35,200
That's good.

1563
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:38,480
I am ready to put on a show.

1564
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:40,980
I got it.

1565
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:43,180
They're all back up though.

1566
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:44,400
Strange as all.

1567
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:45,100
Strange as all.

1568
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:45,700
Lusable.

1569
01:25:46,420 --> 01:25:46,820
Lusable.

1570
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:47,400
Lusable.

1571
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:49,160
Lusable game.

1572
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:49,900
C9able.

1573
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:50,580
C9able.

1574
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:51,620
I'm on it.

1575
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:52,080
I'm not leaving.

1576
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:52,380
I'm on.

1577
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:55,680
I got you guys in the bubbles.

1578
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:56,720
We break it.

1579
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:57,080
Break it.

1580
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:57,280
Break it.

1581
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:57,560
Yeah, break it.

1582
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:57,980
Break it.

1583
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:01,060
I think that's strange as all, I'm pretty sure.

1584
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:01,600
Don't worry.

1585
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:02,980
I took him off.

1586
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:04,400
I knocked him off.

1587
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:05,220
He's flying his way.

1588
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:08,060
Oh my god.

1589
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:10,660
Wait, this is 100% loosable.

1590
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:11,500
I did something crazy.

1591
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:12,280
Right.

1592
01:26:12,580 --> 01:26:13,960
I didn't mean fall off the map.

1593
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:15,840
I'm going to my wall.

1594
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:15,980
I'm going to my wall.

1595
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:16,520
I'm going to my wall here.

1596
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:18,960
I'm dead.

1597
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:19,460
I'm dead.

1598
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:21,660
I'm trying to not see nine.

1599
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:23,220
I got him off.

1600
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:23,940
I killed one.

1601
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:25,860
Who fell off the map?

1602
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:27,680
Craigie fell off the map.

1603
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:30,360
Craigie, no strange swap.

1604
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:31,400
Black is alive.

1605
01:26:32,860 --> 01:26:34,140
Craigie didn't want to swap for strange.

1606
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:35,760
No TP.

1607
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:37,200
We walked over!

1608
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:38,640
Oh my god!

1609
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:39,160
89.

1610
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:40,500
Oh my god.

1611
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:43,480
We need to be more specific when we say you do something crazy.

1612
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:47,060
You fell off what happened in Swap Street.

1613
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:50,360
Oh my god.

1614
01:26:52,260 --> 01:27:04,940
By the way, this Moon Knight skin, when you hit an E, like an onk and it hits someone, it makes this like iconic like teardrop like awesome notification.

1615
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:05,560
It's sick.

Oh my gosh, okay.

1619
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:44,580
They were so organized, they didn't ban anyone.

1620
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:45,600
Oh, yeah.

1621
01:28:47,860 --> 01:28:48,900
Oh, man, wow.

1622
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:51,200
I mean, the gamble is the fun of it.

1623
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:53,300
That was hilarious.

1624
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:54,100
60%.

1625
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:54,840
Hey, give me to Vegas.

1626
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:57,320
I like those odds.

1627
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:01,920
Imagine if we did ban Angela.

1628
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:03,900
I never get invited again.

1629
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:04,900
I respect the group ban, dude.

1630
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:31,840
definitely it's definitely a sign oh no no don't even too much drama what can i say bro target man so this is a new house last night competitive angela i'm in this is just a new mode right yeah where you can like no character limit kind of a thing yeah yeah

1631
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:42,360
It wasn't when I banned Dr. Strange when I banned Root and then I got pulled off of the game.

1632
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:48,090
Like, she's very robust.

1633
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:50,520
I never learned my lesson, apparently.

1634
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:54,120
I just never learned.

1635
01:29:55,420 --> 01:29:55,840
Wait.

1636
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:57,120
Let me show you guys the flying.

1637
01:29:57,240 --> 01:29:58,000
Come back, come back, come back.

1638
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:02,520
What happens if it's like all strange and we put 12 strange portals on the map?

1639
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:03,580
All right, crack.

1640
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:05,180
You want to get the alt at the same time.

1641
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:06,260
I'm ready.

1642
01:30:09,740 --> 01:30:11,040
I'm taking them all off the map.

1643
01:30:13,140 --> 01:30:14,480
I'm taking them off the map.

1644
01:30:15,260 --> 01:30:16,240
I'm going to try with you, brother.

1645
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:17,800
Yeah, we're all trying.

1646
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:19,180
Are we all doing it?

1647
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:20,860
We all have to take one, guys.

1648
01:30:21,820 --> 01:30:23,300
What if they're also...

1649
01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:23,980
What if they're...

1650
01:30:23,980 --> 01:30:24,760
What did he come up with?

1651
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:26,860
I don't know how this is going to work.

1652
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:27,780
Just hit shift and go.

1653
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:28,620
One each.

1654
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:29,080
One each.

1655
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:30,260
I got two.

1656
01:30:30,340 --> 01:30:30,800
I got two.

1657
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:31,860
Oh, it is.

1658
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:32,960
That didn't work.

1659
01:30:33,580 --> 01:30:35,960
Oh, you can bump into each other.

1660
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:36,680
I got one.

1661
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:37,580
I got Tsai Kudo.

1662
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:41,120
Oh my god.

1663
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:43,040
They're playing the spawn room.

1664
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:43,760
Retrieve!

1665
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:44,480
Retrieve!

1666
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:45,160
Retrieve!

1667
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:47,200
Retrieve!

1668
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:48,380
Wait, never give up.

1669
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:49,580
Never give up.

1670
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:51,640
Nick A30 talked about it, bro.

1671
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:54,000
I'm on Moxie.

1672
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:55,320
I'm on Moxie.

1673
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:56,900
He's gotta die here.

1674
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:57,560
He's gotta die here.

1675
01:30:57,660 --> 01:30:59,020
Where is he?

1676
01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:01,780
Try!

1677
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:03,320
I'm abandoning.

1678
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:05,220
I don't know where they are.

1679
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:07,140
I never played it.

1680
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:07,420
I'm dead.

1681
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:11,140
I can't tell where anything is.

1682
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:12,580
They went back to sky.

1683
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:14,300
I'm on the card.

1684
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:14,760
I'm on the card.

1685
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,500
I'm gonna go die.

1686
01:31:16,820 --> 01:31:17,480
Going on the card, guys.

1687
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:20,480
Oh wait, Sam.

1688
01:31:23,420 --> 01:31:25,920
This is so hard to control.

1689
01:31:26,060 --> 01:31:27,300
No, you guys don't understand.

1690
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,700
This is actually so hard to control.

1691
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:31,560
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1692
01:31:33,580 --> 01:31:34,660
Okay, okay, I'm coming now.

1693
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,880
They have been seen and they will not escape.

1694
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:39,200
Oh hey, they're all on me right now.

1695
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:40,800
I fly away.

1696
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:42,520
I'm here.

1697
01:31:42,620 --> 01:31:42,800
I'm here.

1698
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:44,220
Oh my god!

1699
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:46,660
I knocked someone down.

1700
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:48,160
They're all on me!

1701
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:51,600
I'm okay.

1702
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:52,920
1HB!

1703
01:31:53,540 --> 01:31:54,520
No, no, no, no, no!

1704
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:56,480
I'm not gonna spawn!

1705
01:31:57,060 --> 01:31:57,780
Who, I got you!

1706
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:00,200
Foxy tried to creep me out of the air, bro.

1707
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:00,820
Get him!

1708
01:32:01,060 --> 01:32:01,740
I got you!

1709
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:02,060
What?

1710
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:03,040
Let's 2B1M!

1711
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:05,100
No!

1712
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:06,960
He came to the alleyway!

1713
01:32:07,060 --> 01:32:07,380
What?

1714
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:08,720
What's going on?

1715
01:32:08,820 --> 01:32:10,140
I'm playing Mad Kid, playing Mad Kid.

1716
01:32:11,060 --> 01:32:11,540
Yep, you're good.

1717
01:32:13,220 --> 01:32:13,860
I'm swinging.

1718
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:15,540
Wait, what?

1719
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:18,320
I mean, it's so chaotic.

1720
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:20,180
It's so hard!

1721
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:21,980
Find me!

1722
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:22,600
No, no, wait, wait!

1723
01:32:22,740 --> 01:32:23,220

01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:23,720
I got my old!

1725
01:32:23,820 --> 01:32:24,160
I got my old!

1726
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:28,800
Wait, who has all?

1727
01:32:28,860 --> 01:32:29,260
Who has all?

1728
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:29,720
Oh!

1729
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:31,640
Oh, I got no!

1730
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:33,660
Wait, we should just chain her all up.

1731
01:32:33,660 --> 01:32:36,100
I want to just like make them come back here.

1732
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:37,680
Oh my god, I'm being taken.

1733
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:39,460
I'm ulting right now.

1734
01:32:39,740 --> 01:32:40,340
I got two.

1735
01:32:40,940 --> 01:32:41,660
I'm here with you.

1736
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:43,440
Oh, we're, they all ulted.

1737
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:45,860
This is just a chain.

1738
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:47,440
This is just all the stairs.

1739
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:48,340
More and more.

1740
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:49,660
Oh, more and more and more.

1741
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:51,660
Oh, my god.

1742
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:52,660
We're losing.

1743
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:54,620
I'm losing.

1744
01:32:55,180 --> 01:32:55,820
I threw like three.

1745
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:56,660
We have like three ults now.

1746
01:32:57,300 --> 01:32:58,120
We threw like all.

1747
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:00,320
We threw six ults actually.

1748
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:00,760
Don't hit tab.

1749
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:01,360
Don't hit tab.

1750
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:01,840
You have zero elips.

1751
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:03,120
You want to know what you're doing, bro?

1752
01:33:03,340 --> 01:33:03,560
All right.

1753
01:33:03,660 --> 01:33:05,800
I am being targeted, all right?

1754
01:33:06,140 --> 01:33:08,220
Someone has a donut and it's not in real life.

1755
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:09,080
You know what, dude?

1756
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:10,240
Watch this game change at all.

1757
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:13,440
Who gave us Owen?

1758
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:14,220
Oh, he got it.

1759
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:14,960
He got it killed.

1760
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:16,160
He did it.

1761
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:17,800
Look at this game changing, old.

1762
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:19,060
Oh, my God.

1763
01:33:19,540 --> 01:33:20,400
Game changing.

1764
01:33:21,340 --> 01:33:22,480
You like that.

1765
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:26,700
You gave him motivation.

1766
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:29,020
And get your health kids.

1767
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:29,640
Get your health kids.

1768
01:33:29,780 --> 01:33:30,040
Let's get it.

1769
01:33:30,780 --> 01:33:31,280
Let me get you.

1770
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:32,220
You gave him motivation.

1771
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:32,480
Wait a minute.

1772
01:33:32,660 --> 01:33:33,480
Do you guys see this glitch?

1773
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:34,300
Do you see me?

1774
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:35,180
Wait a minute.

1775
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:36,260
What is going on here?

1776
01:33:36,260 --> 01:33:36,840
AJ, AJ.

1777
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:37,860
What are you going to get into, bro?

1778
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:39,720
Wait a minute.

1779
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:42,700
We're on T-Day.

1780
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:46,240
Oh.

1781
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:48,120
Oh my god.

1782
01:33:48,340 --> 01:33:48,800
He ulted.

1783
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:49,840
Yo, okay.

1784
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:54,420
Worst case scenario, if they try to win this game, we just call six strangers and then support, crash the game.

1785
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:55,480
Oh, that's true.

1786
01:33:55,780 --> 01:33:56,800
You can't go into melee.

1787
01:33:57,160 --> 01:33:58,340
I can't go into melee form.

1788
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:03,640
You know, I tried my best.

1789
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:33,840

01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:36,880
Their spawn's close to the edge.

1792
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:38,320
Oh, that's true!

1793
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:40,460
Stand beside the spawn.

1794
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:46,540
I hope.

1795
01:34:48,580 --> 01:34:49,060
Oh, my God.

1796
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:50,540
I hope that I didn't get it.

1797
01:34:50,540 --> 01:34:51,060
I didn't hit anyone.

1798
01:34:51,100 --> 01:34:52,980
Yeah, I was going to say, wait, where did it go?

1799

Oh, I have him.

Moxie, I don't think so.

1817
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:55,000
Yeah, no, Moxie tries to pull a quick one.

01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:56,780
No, wait, what did Moxie do?

1819
01:35:57,900 --> 01:35:59,240
He tried to...

01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:01,460
He tried to 1v2 being craggy with the ult.

1821
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:03,800
Yeah, no, he's out of his mind.

1822
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:05,240
Craggy, I really needed that.

1823
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:05,680
That's him!

1824
01:36:06,580 --> 01:36:08,040
He stole his outfit!

1825
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:11,000
Oh, shit!

1826
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:12,180

The cart's moving.

1848
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:43,260
Cart's moving again.

1849
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:43,900
Cart's moving.

01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:17,680
Yeah, I see it.

1893
01:38:19,220 --> 01:38:21,660
I have a lot of people tethered in here.

1894
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:22,620
I think I'm dead.

1895
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:23,540
I got him.

1896
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:24,300
Yeah, no, I'm in here.

1897
01:38:24,580 --> 01:38:25,480
Wait, did we just lose him?

1898
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:26,240
Wait, did we just lose him?

1899
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:27,160
Wait, did we?

1900
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:28,060
Yes, I got him.

1901
01:38:28,180 --> 01:38:28,740
I got him.

1902
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:29,640
I made him waste his old.

1903
01:38:30,940 --> 01:38:31,060
Nice.

1904
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:32,100
Nice.

1905
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:34,080
He threw it on the ground.

1906
01:38:34,300 --> 01:38:36,540
I flew in the air and even wasted it.

1907
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:37,220
No.

1908
01:38:37,780 --> 01:38:38,180
Moxie.

1909
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:40,720
You pulled his pants down.

1910
01:38:42,140 --> 01:38:42,700
That's a dog.

1911
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:45,040
So we are the better.

1912
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:46,560
Angela team.

1913
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:47,840
One of the better Angelo's, yeah.

1914
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:51,180
We're the real gamers.

1915
01:38:51,700 --> 01:38:52,540
What are you doing after this?

1916
01:39:03,080 --> 01:39:07,040
Now, uh, whips, now what does it say on the dock roll?

1917
01:39:09,580 --> 01:39:12,500
We had, I think it's like, we can pick whatever character we want.

1918
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:13,820
Was it?

1919
01:39:15,380 --> 01:39:43,120
Oh, Vanguard both teams play as vanguards all tanks so basically we all have to do vanguards and one person has to Angela at least hmm all right who wants to be Angela it's got to be someone and who would that someone be don't know about that okay don't twist my arm guys all right

1920
01:39:46,660 --> 01:39:51,540
What if we go one Angela and five pennies, bro?

1921
01:39:53,060 --> 01:39:55,280
Oh my god, we should, yes!

1922
01:39:56,100 --> 01:40:00,740
We should put like, okay, we should be attack and we should be defense and just put it all on the front door.

1923
01:40:02,420 --> 01:40:08,620
It's a random start, so I, like, they have a certain mode, so I can't pick, like, the map or what side we're on.

1924
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:10,060
Oh, I hope we get it.

1925
01:40:10,180 --> 01:40:11,000
I hope we get defense.

1926
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:15,480
We're offense.

1927
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:46,300
we're offense oh we just restart the map and be like oops sorry from what if we what if we're what if we're five the things oh it's quabrin why we're all five captain americas and just run oh my god that would be standing spider-man that would be sick wait captain america sounds like a great idea yeah it does five captain america Dude,

1928
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:49,840
if we did Thor's, if we did all Thor's, we'd all have the team up.

1929
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:51,160
That's true.

1930
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:52,380
I'm down.

1931
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:54,380
Everyone teleporting across the map.

1932
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:57,180
Yeah, the Thor is technically Captain America now.

1933
01:40:57,980 --> 01:40:58,280
True.

1934
01:40:58,920 --> 01:40:59,860
True and yes.

1935
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:01,040
We got to bend this guy's out.

1936
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:03,120
We got to bend Super's out of Warlock just like out of respect.

1937
01:41:03,980 --> 01:41:04,600
Yeah, I agree.

1938
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:05,360
It's got to go out.

1939
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:06,720
I'm down with that.

1940
01:41:06,980 --> 01:41:09,160
We do a 16% Angela right here.

1941
01:41:09,580 --> 01:41:10,400
Jay, you can do it.

1942
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:12,620
Jay, no you want.

1943
01:41:12,660 --> 01:41:13,440
Don't do it.

1944
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:14,160
Don't do it.

1945
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:15,080
Jay, don't do it.

1946
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:25,720
what why was if i banned angela yeah you heard the only 16 percent angela way to conform bro because i would have felt bad why was it if it actually win

1947
01:41:29,040 --> 01:42:03,020
bro tim all i can think about is that one guy on tick tock who baited us into like ravening us into his door pick just like eating right now that thor is just getting all these buffs you know what i mean bro thore mains are on top right now bro you know what's funny i i will say out of all of the tanks no joke like no one i don't really you don't like see magneto one tricks or like they usually have someone else in their bag right but thor never gets banned ever so like i really feel like for vanguard there's really only like captain america or thor one tricks maybe We're defense.

1948
01:42:03,300 --> 01:42:03,560
I'm going.

1949
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:04,780
Wait, wait, wait.

Penny, penny, penny, five pennies.

1952
01:42:07,100 --> 01:42:08,300
It's penny time.

01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:12,740
Wait, we gotta put like a trail of these on the case.

1954

A giant chain.

1968
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:36,120
We need one back here.

1969
01:42:36,220 --> 01:42:37,600
We need one backside of the site.

1970
01:42:39,220 --> 01:42:40,680
Yo, we are not losing.

1971
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:41,880
There's no odds with it.

1972
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:45,060
Last, last, try and pull them into our trap, bro, with the spear.

1973
01:42:45,660 --> 01:42:46,740
Oh, they're walking.

1974
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:47,940
They're all walking, dude.

1975
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:49,640
Wait, wait, we got hide.

1976
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:50,240
We can't show them.

1977
01:42:50,340 --> 01:42:52,700
We can't show them we're five pennies.

1978
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:53,780
We can't.

1979
01:42:54,140 --> 01:42:55,200
Why didn't you show?

1980
01:42:55,660 --> 01:42:56,200
We can't.

1981
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:00,720
Oh, dude, that was actually like a really hard gamma shield.

1982
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:02,620
Dude, they're all caps in America.

1983
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:03,840
They're going to walk into my mines.

1984
01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:04,980
Oh, yeah.

1991
01:43:07,780 --> 01:43:08,060
You see that?

1992
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:08,980
They'll never know.

1993
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:11,920
He's going to hit X.

1994
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:13,040
He's going to hit X.

1995
01:43:21,820 --> 01:43:23,060

I got news for them, bro.

1997
01:43:28,980 --> 01:43:29,860

Yeah.

1999
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:31,900
No, they're not.

2000
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:34,080
This is an impenetrable defense here.

2001
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:35,040
Oh my God.

2002
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:36,660
There is no beating this team.

They're not getting out into here.

2016
01:43:58,520 --> 01:43:58,940
Look at...

2017
01:43:58,940 --> 01:43:59,980
Dude, they all connect.

Oh, they're putting him back

2025
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:23,620

01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:35,320
Oh, no.

2062
01:46:35,320 --> 01:46:36,980
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2063
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:37,780
Waiting, wait.

2064
01:46:37,780 --> 01:46:39,360
No no, no, I'm TPing M Chad's map.

2065
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:39,840
I'm TPing Moshi off the map.

2066
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:41,800
Oh, you are not.

2067
01:46:42,660 --> 01:46:43,440
Oh, here, here.

2068
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:44,320
I'll do another portal.

2069
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:45,140
I'll do another portal.

2070
01:46:45,220 --> 01:46:46,620
Oh, we're in your chair.

2071
01:46:46,940 --> 01:46:47,720
That chair's a cooldown.

2072
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:49,160
Get back to the point.

2073
01:46:49,540 --> 01:46:50,480
I'm still alive.

2074
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:50,880
Somehow.

2075
01:46:52,360 --> 01:46:53,120
Get back to the point.

2076
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:56,140
Doki with an elimination and the stall of his entry.

2077
01:46:56,840 --> 01:46:57,080
Please.

2078
01:46:57,200 --> 01:46:58,440
I stalled for so long.

2079
01:46:58,640 --> 01:46:58,700
Oh.

Oh, my God.

2088
01:47:41,530 --> 01:47:43,310
Look at all the spiders.

2089
01:47:44,130 --> 01:47:45,310
Oh, my goodness.

2090
01:47:48,770 --> 01:47:51,850
Marvel, I think we should let everyone play Penny on one team.

2091
01:47:52,310 --> 01:47:52,790
Thoughts?

2092
01:47:52,870 --> 01:47:53,490
Oh, my God.

2093
01:47:53,690 --> 01:47:54,470
That's too funny, bro.

2094
01:47:54,730 --> 01:47:56,770
Oh, we should have no limit.

2095
01:47:56,850 --> 01:47:59,050
We should bring no limits into rank.

2096
01:48:00,510 --> 01:48:02,310
Was that my idea?

2097
01:48:02,310 --> 01:48:03,010
Was that my idea?

2098
01:48:03,150 --> 01:48:03,810
I think it was Tim.

That was fun.

2104
01:49:13,570 --> 01:49:15,650
I think that was actually...

2105
01:49:15,650 --> 01:49:17,710
I'm glad I was not on attack.

2106
01:49:17,890 --> 01:49:20,130
I'm so happy because I feel like they would have done the same thing.

2107
01:49:21,550 --> 01:49:24,730
I feel like I'm so happy.

2108
01:49:24,930 --> 01:49:26,450
We did not have to play against that.

2109
01:49:26,890 --> 01:49:27,830
I would have been so angry.

2110
01:49:27,830 --> 01:49:31,470
So does Moxie and like Super live in the server or...

2111

Looks like it.

2112
01:49:33,370 --> 01:49:34,190
Nine MS.

2113
01:49:34,350 --> 01:49:35,870
They did not have to fight.

2114
01:49:36,130 --> 01:49:37,150
As long as...

2115
01:49:37,470 --> 01:49:39,710

2116
01:49:40,250 --> 01:49:41,470

01:49:42,350 --> 01:49:42,710
What are the odds about?

2118
01:49:43,010 --> 01:49:43,790
What are the odds?

2119
01:49:45,330 --> 01:49:46,630
Oh, it's Central Park.

2120
01:49:46,930 --> 01:49:48,290
Oh, it's Central Park, my favorite.

2121
01:49:49,530 --> 01:49:50,650
Wait, this is...

2122
01:49:50,650 --> 01:49:50,950
Oh, yeah.

2123
01:49:52,530 --> 01:49:54,430
Yeah, it's a different map, Tyler.

2124
01:49:56,250 --> 01:49:58,250
No, I'm pretty sure this is the same exact one.

2125
01:49:58,870 --> 01:49:59,890
It is the same exact one.

2126
01:50:00,270 --> 01:50:02,190
Yeah, so Tyler's right.

2127
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:03,250
So do I back out?

2128
01:50:03,370 --> 01:50:06,270
Say that one more time and I gotta unzip real quick.

2129
01:50:06,430 --> 01:50:06,890
All right, go.

2130
01:50:07,410 --> 01:50:08,890
God, wait, what?

2131
01:50:09,570 --> 01:50:10,150
Tyler's right.

2132
01:50:10,410 --> 01:50:10,930
Oh, my God.

2133
01:50:10,990 --> 01:50:11,890
No one ever says that.

2134
01:50:12,630 --> 01:50:12,750
Nope.

2135
01:50:13,690 --> 01:50:14,510
So do I need to be kidding.

2136
01:50:14,830 --> 01:50:15,350
You know what's funny?

2137
01:50:15,650 --> 01:50:17,610
No one's ever, I don't think anyone's ever said that to me, bro.

2138
01:50:17,750 --> 01:50:19,850
Like, I think you just like unlocked like some trauma.

2144
01:50:33,470 --> 01:50:33,890
That's fair.

2145
01:50:35,630 --> 01:50:36,450
That's so fair.

2146
01:50:36,850 --> 01:50:37,390

01:51:40,430 --> 01:51:42,550

They'll never know.

2154
01:51:49,930 --> 01:51:51,450
Just put them all over the point.

2155
01:51:51,610 --> 01:51:52,750
Put them all over the point.

2156
01:51:53,130 --> 01:51:55,150

Yeah, yeah.

Make a line.

2188
01:55:57,800 --> 01:55:58,200
There's a bubble.

2189
01:55:58,600 --> 01:55:59,200
Oh no.

2190
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:00,260
No, that was.

2191
01:56:00,540 --> 01:56:01,980
Oh, that killed all our gems.

2192
01:56:02,380 --> 01:56:02,880
What happened?

2193
01:56:04,660 --> 01:56:05,300
That's tragic.

2194
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:05,580
Right.

2195
01:56:05,660 --> 01:56:06,480
They got a big fatty.

2196
01:56:06,660 --> 01:56:07,040
Oh no.

2197
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:08,060
No, no.

2198
01:56:08,620 --> 01:56:09,600
Are we doing it?

2199
01:56:09,660 --> 01:56:10,240
Hulk no more?

2200
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:12,940
No, no, no, no.

2201

We got this.

2202
01:56:13,620 --> 01:56:13,980
We got this.

2203
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:16,520
Oh, but the edge of the map is close.

2204
01:56:16,640 --> 01:56:18,220
So if we get old, just take them off.

2205
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:22,580
Last, this is your time to shine.

2206
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:23,760
Absolutely rinsed.

2207
01:56:27,710 --> 01:56:27,970
Nice.

2208
01:56:28,110 --> 01:56:29,270

Check X out.

2210
01:56:31,930 --> 01:56:32,370

2211
01:56:33,390 --> 01:56:33,710
Wait, wait.

2212
01:56:33,830 --> 01:56:34,090
Oh, no!

2213
01:56:34,530 --> 01:56:35,670
Wait, how did that not get me?

2214
01:56:36,730 --> 01:56:39,070
I'm trying to save whoever's in there, but I can't.

2215
01:56:39,710 --> 01:56:40,330
Oh, no!

2216
01:56:40,590 --> 01:56:41,310
He's getting coffee!

2217
01:56:42,650 --> 01:56:43,450
Oh, my God!

2218
01:56:44,110 --> 01:56:44,630
Oh, my God!

2221
01:56:49,570 --> 01:56:50,030
Oh!

2222
01:56:51,570 --> 01:56:52,450
Oh, no.

2223
01:56:57,860 --> 01:56:59,660
There's so many bubbles on the floor.

2224
01:56:59,700 --> 01:57:00,120
I'm stolen.

2225
01:57:00,280 --> 01:57:00,700
I'm stolen.

2226
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:01,240
I need more.

2227
01:57:01,240 --> 01:57:01,800
He's doing it.

2228
01:57:02,300 --> 01:57:03,560
I'm just going in circles.

2229
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:04,680
I'm just going in circles.

2230
01:57:05,940 --> 01:57:06,840
Wait, they hit the checkpoint.

2231
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:07,400
What the heck?

2232
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:08,220
Oh, no.

2233
01:57:08,380 --> 01:57:08,720
Wait.

2234
01:57:09,020 --> 01:57:10,460
Do you not stall when you're under?

2235
01:57:11,200 --> 01:57:12,020
No, no, no, no.

2236
01:57:12,100 --> 01:57:12,700
That'd be so toxic.

2237
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:14,160
Oh, man.

2238
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:17,480
Five just men.

2239
01:57:17,780 --> 01:57:20,260
X just peaked up and got half health instantly.

2240
01:57:22,820 --> 01:57:23,260
Okay.

2241
01:57:23,340 --> 01:57:24,100
Remember, the map.

2242
01:57:24,100 --> 01:57:26,100
We can take him off the map still here.

2243
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:31,660
Oh, it should have been five Jeffs and one Emma.

2244
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:34,800
My baby!

2245
01:57:36,340 --> 01:57:37,480
Moxie flanking weak?

2246
01:57:39,660 --> 01:57:40,920
We should push up with that.

2247
01:57:44,810 --> 01:57:45,930
Or Moxie's actually bad with it.

2248
01:57:46,330 --> 01:57:47,930
I got two flanking, two flanking, two flanking, one.

2249
01:57:47,930 --> 01:57:49,590
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

2250
01:57:51,970 --> 01:57:52,630
He's what?

2251
01:57:52,710 --> 01:57:54,850
Oh no, he just got absolutely blasted.

2252
01:57:55,330 --> 01:57:57,390
Alright guys, we just gotta defend this for four minutes.

2253
01:57:57,410 --> 01:57:58,750
Oh, my God.

2254
01:58:03,410 --> 01:58:04,210
He's one.

2255
01:58:07,810 --> 01:58:08,710

2256
01:58:09,330 --> 01:58:10,150
Okay, yeah, I got two off.

2272
01:58:39,290 --> 01:58:39,830
This is not fair.

2273
01:58:40,250 --> 01:58:41,270
