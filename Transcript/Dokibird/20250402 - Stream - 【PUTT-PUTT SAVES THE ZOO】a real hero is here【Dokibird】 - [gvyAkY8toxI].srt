00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,500
Hello.

2
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,280
Sorry, I'm like dead inside right now.

3
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,060
Look guys, I'm still here.

4
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,520
Oh my god.

5
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,400
Guys, for those who missed out on the rival stream.

6
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,960
Guys, oh my god.

7
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,320
There's like a party behind the farm, guys.

8
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,840
I don't know why you guys were all so worried about me.

9
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,400
See, I'm still here.

10
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,820
I can't believe it.

11
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,920
There was a party behind the farm.

12
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:26,060
And then, today, they said they're gonna take me to the pasture upstate.

13
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,820
Wow, I wonder what that is too.

14
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,580
Maybe it's another party.

15
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,600
After this stream, they're gonna take me up to the pasture upstate.

16
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,320
I hope it's another party.

17
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,660
They said if I do really, really well.

18
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,300
Or what if I don't do well?

19
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,280
I don't remember.

20
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:09,360
But all I remember is that I get to go to another party.

21
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,500
I'm a little dead inside right now.

22
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,140
I know this.

23
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,480
I also got an email.

24
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,640
I got an email from my accountant.

25
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,720
And then I read the email today.

26
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,680
And then I was like, today is Doe Kitty Day again.

27
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,340
Today is Doe Kitty Day.

28
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,560
Doe Kitty Day.

29
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:55,440
She was trying to explain to me the difference between filing tax returns and corporate income tax.

30
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,440
And I still, I don't understand.

31
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,920
I have to pay more?

32
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:13,320
I thought I have to pay more?

33
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,400
There's more stuff I have to pay?

34
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:25,920
Outside?

35
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,880
Outside?

36
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,300
I don't understand.

37
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,920
I thought corporate taxes was...

38
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,060
I thought that was what the company taxes were.

39
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,420
What do you mean there's more?

40
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,340
I already paid so much, guys.

41
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,060
I don't understand.

42
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,840
I already paid so much.

43
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,280
It's okay.

44
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:12,260
That's why today, today I'm Doe Kitty again.

45
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:17,100
I'm Doe Kitty round two.

46
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,500
Anyway, I went to bed really late.

47
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,360
As you can tell how dead inside I am right now.

48
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,000
I still can't believe I have to pay more.

49
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,470
I thought I was like...

50
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,970
I'm sorry, I'm still thinking about it because I'm like, I paid so much.

51
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:49,330
I paid so much that I have to pay even more.

52
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,730
I was like, wait, there's more.

53
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,490
Thank you for the super chat.

54
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,630
Thank you, thank you.

55
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:06,290
We need to get more ports of Humongous Games on every console.

56
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,470
We should be making our kids play this.

57
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,330
Thank you for the super chat.

58
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,190
Thank you, thank you.

59
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,510
I wish we could get remasters of all...

60
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:26,030
Okay, I was trying to figure out how to play PC games that are really old, that don't have ports at all.

61
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:35,410
And I was looking up guides and I was like, trying to...

62
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:42,030
Okay, before I chose Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo, my first pick was actually...

63
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:48,270
My first pick was actually Blue's Clues Treasure Hunt.

64
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:59,030
Because I actually grew up with that game and I would play it on repeat a lot when I was a little baby.

65
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,430
And I loved the Blue's Clues games back then.

66
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:06,850
And I was trying to figure out how to play that on my PC.

67
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:22,190
And then I installed a bunch of stuff and none of it worked because I realized I had to set up a virtual machine.

68
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:32,850
So that it runs a Windows XP, like a version of Windows that's XP, which is like 2000s.

69
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,690
Like actual little 2000s.

70
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:42,850
And I was looking up the tutorials and the guides and I was just like...

71
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:52,810
I can barely function as a human being, let alone set up whatever this thing is.

72
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,250
I was like...

73
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,290
I was like, I'm trying to pay my taxes right now and I'm not doing okay.

74
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:08,990
I don't think I can set up a virtual machine.

75
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,930
I can't even set up a dual PC.

76
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:24,230
I can't even set up a second PC that is like the current setup right now.

77
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:31,250
Let alone a virtual machine that I have to boot up on my own PC.

78
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,170
And it has to run Windows XP.

79
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:44,690
I watched like two tutorials and I was like, this is not it.

80
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,930
This is not it.

81
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:57,130
I guess we're never gonna play Blue's Clues Treasure Hunt or VirtualBox.

82
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,370
It's the same thing.

83
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,330
I watched the tutorial and I just...

84
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:07,170
The moment I typed virtual, I was like, did I even look up VirtualBox?

85
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:13,350
And then the moment I looked up VirtualBox, I had my Google history.

86
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,500
It was like, yeah, VirtualBox, Windows XP.

87
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:26,590
My PC was like, yeah, I remember you trying to figure this out.

88
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,910
I still have that history.

89
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,010
We still have your history.

90
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,370
You tried to figure it out.

91
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:54,810
No, I don't have my second PC, but I have to like, whenever I do get it, I have to figure out how to set that up by myself.

92
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,450
No, it was on my Google search bar.

93
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:09,290
Like, you know, before you go to Google, it like tells you like, what are the things you recently typed out that sort of matched it?

94
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,790
And that was one of them.

95
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,630
It was literally like virtual.

96
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:18,710
I typed virtual and then my Google filled it in with VirtualBox, Windows XP.

97
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,210
So guys, I tried, guys.

98
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:30,750
Pastokie has tried to understand.

99
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,030
Pastokie did not understand.

100
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:48,690
I even did, what the fuck, I even tried to deal, not only did I try VirtualBox, I actually downloaded DOS, BOS, DOSBOS or whatever.

101
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,690
And then I was just, I was like typing code and stuff.

102
00:10:52,790 --> 00:11:01,590
I was like, C drive, mount, program files.

103
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,850
I was like, what the fuck am I doing with my life?

104
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,750
I just wanted to play Blue's Clues.

105
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:17,260
I just wanted to play Blue's Clues, but I couldn't because they're like, you have to.

106
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:23,380
I have to apparently, I have to apparently still have Windows XP.

107
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,380
It doesn't work.

108
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:31,360
I typed, I typed program names and then command names.

109
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,660
I don't fucking know.

110
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,560
I typed command prompts and everything.

111
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,280
And then they're like, you still need to, you still need Windows XP.

112
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,540
You still, you still need it.

113
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,260
I was like, what's, what's the point?

114
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,960
Oh my God.

115
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,220
Oh, it's all right.

116
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,680
We were not.

117
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,600
And then, so I was just like, Puppa saves the zoo day.

118
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:14,120
I spent like an hour and a half figuring it out.

119
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,160
And I was like, all right, Puppa saves the day.

120
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,560
Puppa saves the zoo.

121
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,980
At least you're ported on Steam.

122
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,020
I'm so stupid.

123
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,440
Yep.

124
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,840
And I'm super excited to try.

125
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,340
I'm so dead and I'm still waking up.

126
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,280
I went to bed at like six in the morning, I believe.

127
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,260
Because I had to do some, I had to do some work stuff.

128
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:58,980
After the, after the, you can tell what I'm trying to think really hard with my one brain cell right now.

129
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:09,670
I'm like, my brain is like processing at the moment.

130
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:28,050
That's why I, I'm extra dead inside because whenever I have to sleep past four in the morning and then wake up at 1230 PM PST, I'm not, I'm never a person.

131
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:32,230
I don't, I don't function as a human.

132
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:37,610
I don't function as a human being, a legal human being.

133
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:46,610
I think like legally, I, I am not categorized as alive.

134
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:55,710
For, for like an hour or two and then, and then I'll be a person after that.

135
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:04,910
But anyway, today we're playing Pup Pup Saves the Zoo.

136
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:11,510
Arguably, it is actually known as one of the most famous, humongous games.

137
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,450
I don't know why.

138
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:23,870
It feels like everybody knows, like, if we talk about like humongous games back then, it feels like everybody has played Pup Pup Saves the Zoo or it's like their favorite.

139
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:32,990
It's like the favorite, their favorite game out of all, of all the games from the series.

140
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,490
No, it's crazy.

141
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:40,410
I see like so many talk about Pup Pup Saves the Zoo all the time.

142
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:47,390
And it's like, I don't know, maybe it's like the meme, like it's like the meme back then, or maybe it's like the most accessible humongous games.

143
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,050
I had Pup Pup Saves the Zoo too.

144
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,390
I think I had to Pup Pup Time Travel as well.

145
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:59,630
I had, I think I had, I have at least like one out of each of the characters.

146
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,430
So I have Spy Fox and the Hairspray one.

147
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,390
That was the one I played from Spy Fox.

148
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:09,110
Then I had, I had a lot of the Freddy Fish ones and Pajama Sam as well.

149
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:16,510
Pup Pup, I think I've only had the Zoo and the Time Travel one and the Circus and the Circus.

150
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,770
Unless the Circus was the Zoo.

151
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,150
No, the Circus was not the Zoo.

152
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:22,930
I had the Circus, Zoo and Time Travel.

153
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:34,130
They're honestly one of my favorite games growing up because my parents would go to Costco and just buy me humongous games.

154
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,210
Every time they see one, they'll just get me one of them.

155
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:45,650
And it's like, honestly, like I would play it on nonstop on repeat on my PC all the time as a little bird because I was not allowed on the Internet.

156
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:52,110
You know, as a little bird, as a little child, like, well, it's crazy.

157
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:58,050
Back in the day, because we didn't know like what the fuck the Internet was like that.

158
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,270
Like we didn't know like the dangers of the Internet.

159
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:05,030
But like, but like as Asian parents, you know, everything is dangerous.

160
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:09,090
So I was allowed to be connected to the Internet back then as a little kid.

161
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:20,450
Now, nowadays, nowadays, if a parent is busy and they don't want to deal with a child, they're like, here's an iPad.

162
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,390
Go fucking wild.

163
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,450
Look up whatever the fuck you want.

164
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:33,210
I think my parents gave me a PC that was not connected to the Internet.

165
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:39,990
So I did not know how that felt like until I was like eight years old, I think.

166
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:54,270
I think it was like, I think the first time I ever got to experience what the Internet was like, was like, but I get to watch my parents do like, like Chinese MMO games like on their own PCs.

167
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:58,570
Because back then, my parents, oh, I think I told you guys about this, this lore drop.

168
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:03,670
But back then, my parents were, are and were, were and are gamers.

169
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:09,570
And when I was growing up, they would play this like Chinese MMO game.

170
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:13,750
I don't know, like, and it's like Chinese MMO game every night.

171
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:18,630
And then, and then, no, both of them played it and stuff.

172
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,650
And then, but now, like, and their, their setup was at the basement.

173
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:26,790
I had my like, like, OK, not my PlayStation, my dad's PlayStation.

174
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:36,370
But sometimes I would go downstairs to play like on the PlayStation while my parents would be like gaming on their Chinese MMO downstairs in the basement.

175
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,330
And then I would watch them play their Chinese MMO.

176
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:49,730
And like, and while I was just like sit there because I was like, really, you know, as a kid, I was just like, wow, you're talking with like random people on the Internet.

177
00:17:49,730 --> 00:18:04,170
And then, and then at one point, I think when I was eight years old, I was finally allowed to use the Internet because, like, because I, I really wanted to check out, what is it called?

178
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:10,050
Obviously, my mom supervised me, but I wanted to check out Neopets.

179
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:15,850
And then, like, and then so, like, my mom was like, all right, you can use the Internet.

180
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:20,030
Because, like, this seems like a very safe place to be on.

181
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,590
Little do they know.

182
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,650
Neopets was the, this is a progression.

183
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,830
It introduced me to the, to the other side.

184
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:34,190
It made me who I am today.

185
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,630
It's from Neopets.

186
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,590
OK, it's not because as a child, I didn't fucking find out about the progression.

187
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,270
OK, the next progression, it was Neopets.

188
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,830
Then I found out about DeviantArt.

189
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:48,490
And through DeviantArt, I found out about Tumblr.

190
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,290
And then through Tumblr, I got onto Twitter.

191
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:56,250
And then through Twitter, um, I found out about VTubing.

192
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,390
And through VTubing, oh wait no, about gaming.

193
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,930
Through Twitter, I found out about gaming.

194
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:05,750
And then through gaming, I found out about VTubing.

195
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,070
And through VTubing, I am here now.

196
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:18,370
And that's where it all connects.

197
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,430
The degeneracy pipeline.

198
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,890
It was all because of Neopets.

199
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:31,850
I would have been a shelter child if it wasn't for Neopets.

200
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:32,790
But anyway...

201
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:42,850
But anyway, it's actually quite interesting how back then, like, kids weren't, like, just freely allowed on the internet.

202
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:50,010
And now, I bet you, there's some fucking 10-year-old actually watching my stream right now.

203
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:55,770
And, child, if you are watching my stream right now, you're not fucking allowed here.

204
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,610
Like, get the fuck off your iPad.

205
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:06,990
How did you bypass the YouTube Kids app?

206
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,730
Like, where are your parents?

207
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:15,970
I am not responsible for whatever the fuck's gonna happen to you when you grow up.

208
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,230
Like, legally, I am not responsible for that.

209
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:25,990
Because you clicked yes on the TOS that you are 13 years or older, and you're 10 watching my stream right now?

210
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:31,350
You've already broken the TOS, and you can't legally do anything to me if I fuck up your life.

211
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,030
If I...

212
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:45,250
If I traumatize you in any way or ruin your life in any way via my streams because you're too young to watch this fucking stream, then legally, you can't sue me.

213
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:52,270
Because you said yes on the TOS, and I know you didn't fucking read the TOS, because I don't.

214
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,890
And I'm an adult.

215
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:05,790
Dr. Cranberry, are you telling 95% of your audience to leave her stream?

216
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,450
Okay, but if you're mentally 10, you're okay.

217
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,290
You're safe here.

218
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,430
That's why I'm here.

219
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,850
Thank you for the super chat.

220
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,290
Thank you, thank you.

221
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,110
Solid Snake, thank you for the super chat.

222
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:24,870
Thank you, thank you.

223
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:28,670
On one side, thank you Neopets for Dogekitty.

224
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,970
On the other hand, Neopets, screw the Dr. Dogepatch.

225
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,690
Thank you for the super chat.

226
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:34,610
Thank you, thank you.

227
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,990
I am at the legal definition of being an adult, okay?

228
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,070
I'm there.

229
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:48,730
As long as I fit one of the requirements of what it is to be an adult, and mine is age.

230
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:55,610
I fit one out of, like, the five requirements.

231
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,370
I fit the age one.

232
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,630
Okay, guys?

233
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:04,190
So, legally and technically, by definition of adulthood, I am an adult.

234
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,570
Trying to figure out how to pay taxes.

235
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,010
Okay, anyway, guys.

236
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:13,710
Oh, other than that, I guess I'll mention about the Nintendo Switch 2 news.

237
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,730
I didn't watch the Nintendo Direct.

238
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:16,730
I opened Twitter.

239
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,550
Everybody's complaining about it.

240
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:22,410
But you're all just gonna fucking buy the console anyway.

241
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:29,110
So, like, feels like any other Nintendo Direct.

242
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:36,290
It just feels like the same thing.

243
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,590
Like, oh, did they announce Silksong?

244
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,990
Oh my- wait, actually?

245
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,950
No, there's no way.

246
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,990
They actually announced it?

247
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:52,450
Silksong reconfirms window- window announces Switch 2 version.

248
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,550
Did they actually confirm, like, a launch date?

249
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:59,370
Or were they, like, it's still- Oh, for 2025?

250
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:01,490
What?

251
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,610
At June 5th?

252
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,430
Oh my god.

253
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:12,670
And before, they were like, sorry, this was supposed to be an April Fool's joke, but they released it a day late.

254
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,570
I'm sorry.

255
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:22,930
Gambit, thank you for the super chat.

256
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,090
Thank you, thank you.

257
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,510
This is Wii U too.

258
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,410
Only 8 seconds.

259
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,090
Jesus Christ.

260
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:35,050
Alright, so people are saying it could be, like, June or December.

261
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:36,170
There's no way.

262
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:46,650
I feel like if they released 8 seconds of- of a fucking trailer of a game, I don't think it's gonna be any time soon.

263
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,690
It has to be, like, holiday season.

264
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:56,610
So, um, I won't be surprised if it's the holiday season for Silksong.

265
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:59,250
Just cause, like, that's usually how the case is.

266
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,930
Or just- just don't expect anything.

267
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:07,570
And, uh, just- never- never have hope.

268
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,750
Then you'll never be disappointed, chat.

269
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,390
Oh my god, that's interesting.

270
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:15,770
I mean, that's good news.

271
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:25,250
I heard, like, a lot of- I don't know, I didn't really read much about the, um, about the bad stuff from the Switch announcement.

272
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:32,050
But it's funny that the announcement was based off of the Nintendo Switch 2.

273
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:39,430
And then my entire chat was like, okay, but what about the 8 seconds of Silksong that we just got?

274
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:43,590
And I'm like, wasn't the announcement mostly about the Nintendo Switch 2?

275
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:44,470
Like-

276
00:24:48,070 --> 00:25:03,070
For me, if, like, if everybody's focusing on the 8 second trailer, uh, that means the news was not, uh, was not- was not the best.

277
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:07,270
It was 2 seconds, get it right.

278
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:10,550
Who cares about Switch 2?

279
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:18,050
Wait, $80 a game?

280
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,910
Holy fuck.

281
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:24,990
Oh my god, they're just like, hey, you wanna see me milk our fans even more?

282
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:33,770
Oh my god, that's- that's actually crazy.

283
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:36,390
$80 per game?

284
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:43,910
I didn't- I don't know what- what kind of exclusive games are they gonna get on that Switch to manage to, like, pull that off?

285
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:53,630
I can't wait to pay 80- I can't wait to play Marvel Rivals on the Switch, guys, on the Switch 2.

286
00:25:55,090 --> 00:26:05,090
That's actually- that's actually- it's like- that's like- oh my god, I'm like, just thinking, like, that's actually really crazy.

287
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:08,830
80- I don't think I've, like, spent $80 on a video.

288
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,710
Oh my god, and that's American.

289
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:17,270
Oh my god, that's a hundred- wait, how much 80 USD to Canadian?

290
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:20,670
That's a hundred and fourteen Canadian dollars.

291
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:27,990
I am not- guys, I'm not spending a hundred plus dollars on a fucking Switch game.

292
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:30,650
Guys, I do not care.

293
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:35,490
Like, I- I do not care that much.

294
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:44,950
Like- it'd be a hundred and twenty dollars with taxes, too.

295
00:26:45,010 --> 00:27:00,610
Oh my god, who the fuck- anyway, anyway, oh yeah, so, speaking of Nintendo stuff, I don't know if you guys heard about it.

296
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:04,930
I saw Kony streaming it and I got really curious, but apparently- what's his name?

297
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:05,670
Alpharad?

298
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:12,990
Yesterday, released a three-year project of a Pokemon Mario game.

299
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:24,870
So that- it's basically a- it's basically a passion project and, like, a parody of Pokemon, but all the characters are replaced with Mario characters.

300
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:35,490
I was watching Kony playing it and it seemed really, really fun, and I was, like, wondering how he got- like, how he got the download links for it, because I couldn't find the download links.

301
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:46,590
And apparently- because, like, Kony's really good friends with Alpharad, he actually got the download for the game as, like, a- you know, you're my friend, you get to play the game early.

302
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:49,950
Because I was, like, wait, how come, like, what about, like, for public release?

303
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:56,330
And then Kony was, like, oh yeah, um, Alpharad's not gonna release it until Twitch beats the game.

304
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:59,030
And I was, like, oh my god.

305
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:07,850
Alright, so, because I wanted to stream it because it looked really interesting, I thought it was a really interesting, um, uh, parody- uh, parody mod.

306
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:16,270
And so they- so- so basically, until Twitch beats, uh- oh my god, they've been playing for 22 hours now.

307
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:22,110
Um, until Twitch beats the game, nobody's gonna be able to access it for now.

308
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:38,990
So, like, uh, Kony was saying, like, um, yeah, at the pace Twitch is playing right now, like- At the pace they're doing, it might take, like, one to two weeks of just playing the game.

309
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,650
Wait, what is this?

310
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:53,810
That stream was- yeah, I was, like, yeah, so I'll link it, but literally it's Twitch plays Pokemon, but right now it's Twitch playing Super Mario Mon right now.

311
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:59,790
And, yeah, apparently they're predicting- Alpharad's predicting one to two weeks.

312
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:10,450
But, like, I'm watching this right now, and- and it feels like they've been- it looks like they've been stuck here for a while now.

313
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:19,680
Yeah, um, um, anyway, but it looks really interesting.

314
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:27,740
I was actually very interested in this game, and I haven't played a Pokemon game outside- I mean, I don't count Arceus- what was it?

315
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,160
Uh, what was that game?

316
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:34,740
The one that- was it Pokemon, um... Arceus?

317
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,100
Legend?

318
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:35,940
Like, Pokemon Legends?

319
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:42,560
I don't count Pokemon Legends into the series, because it's so different from the actual, uh, Pokemon genre.

320
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:53,020
But I had, like, the main- mainline series, uh, but I haven't played the mainline serie- the mainline series in, um, in- oh my gosh.

321
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:58,780
Since Pokemon X and Y, because that's where the Paris Tower is, and I didn't even finish Pokemon X and Y.

322
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:03,040
I- I didn't even finish that game.

323
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:11,520
Um, so that's why I was like- I don't know, I felt like this game seems really fun and interesting, and, um, it's something I wanted to try out.

324
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:25,000
Um, just cause- like, the reason why I don't like playing- I don't like the mainline Pokemon games is that it's incredibly, uh, what's the word?

325
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:29,860
It's, uh, repetitive.

326
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:37,120
And, I mean, this is gonna be really repetitive, but like, it felt- it felt like they've been recycling the same thing.

327
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,980
Formulaic, yes, formulaic.

328
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,100
It was so incredibly formulaic that, like, I just got bored.

329
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:59,120
Uh, haha, I just got incredibly bored with the game because it was just incredibly formulaic, and they kept making the games easier and easier and easier that I just wasn't- I just- it felt like a chore trying to beat the game.

330
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:06,460
Like, haha, so, so that's why, like, I stopped at X and Y.

331
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:20,940
Um, but the Mario Mon game actually looks really interesting cause apparently they have, like, various different mechanics drawn from actual Mario games, um, that's being put into the Mario Mon ones.

332
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,500
And they're like, you know, mix up some stuff within the formula.

333
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:32,980
And, you know, I was curious about, like, what kind of Mario Mon that you can use versus Pokemon.

334
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,580
Um, I'm also, like, not a fan of more recent Pokemon designs.

335
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:47,860
So, like, I don't feel, like, much, like, love towards the Pokemon game, like, the newer Pokemon or, like, more attachment to newer Pokemons.

336
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:54,540
So, that's why I also sort of, like, just got really tired and bored of the newer games as well.

337
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:59,480
Um, anyways, let's actually, let's actually play Pup Pup Saves the Zoo.

338
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,640
Look, I had to have, like, a conversation with you guys.

339
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:11,460
Because, I don't know if you know this, but Pup Pup Saves the Zoo is a child, is a game for children.

340
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:20,980
And I believe if I didn't talk to you guys for 30 plus minutes, I would have finished this game in 30 minutes.

341
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:33,340
If I don't beat this game within 30 minutes, I should be outside, I think I should be kicked out of the definition of an adult at that point.

342
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:49,100
Like, I think I revoke my adult card if it does go, if we get to that point in life.

343
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,460
Alright, Pup Pup Saves the Zoo.

344
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,100
Alright, let's see.

345
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,260
Whoa, humongous.

346
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,360
Also, I hope Sound Guy is here.

347
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:00,780
Oh no.

348
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,540
Oh no.

349
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,300
Yeah!

350
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,260
Pup Pup Saves the Zoo.

351
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,520
Pup Pup Saves the Zoo.

352
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,680
Pup Pup Saves the Zoo.

353
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,260
Pup Pup Saves the Zoo.

354
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:17,860
Yeah!

355
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,020
Pup Pup Saves the Zoo.

356
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,800
Oh my gosh.

357
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,160
Pup Pup Saves the Zoo.

358
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,260
Pup Pup Saves the Zoo.

359
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,400
Pup Pup Saves the Zoo.

360
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,460
Pup-Put saves the zoo?

361
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:57,160
Did they ever explain why, like, Pup-Put's dog changed breeds?

362
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,740
Like, did the old dog die?

363
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,860
Did they ever explain it?

364
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:12,320
For those who don't know, Pup-Put's dog was not this guy before.

365
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,440
It was, like, a yellow dog.

366
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,360
And then, out of nowhere, his dog changed.

367
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,260
Did they ever explain?

368
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:33,420
Did they ever explain why his dog is a different color?

369
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,560
I don't think they did.

370
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,380
Now the kids are confused.

371
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,460
Alright, let me fix the layout real quick.

372
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,280
Alright.

373
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:54,380
Yeah, when they changed the dog, I was just like, what happened to the yellow dog?

374
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,300
And I got really confused as a child.

375
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:06,840
And now as an adult, I'm like, oh my god, did that dog, like, pass away?

376
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,320
Did Pup-Put outlive them?

377
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:14,940
Hello.

378
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,660
No, I was just here.

379
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,880
Don't worry, Mr. Baldini.

380
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,040
Alright, wait, I forgot to check something real quick.

381
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:29,520
Woah.

382
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:33,620
Okay, I gotta make sure I didn't blow my nose before we begin.

383
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,300
Midway.

384
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,000
That's right.

385
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,100
Warren, thank you for the super chat.

386
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,160
Thank you, thank you.

387
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,180
DougDoug played this, and it took him an hour.

388
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,200
How the fuck does this game take an hour?

389
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,900
Oh, look, there's Freddy Fish.

390
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,080
For those who don't know what Humancy games are, it's basically a point-and-click adventure.

391
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:05,260
And there's, like, puzzles and stuff, so every time you click, they do a little animation and stuff.

392
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,020
Like, look at this.

393
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,240
Oh my god.

394
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:13,920
So, like, instead of, you know, YouTube kids that, like, give you slop and everything.

395
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,920
And, like...

396
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,920
Overwhelm you with as much...

397
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,280
As much stuff as possible on the screen.

398
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,140
We have this.

399
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,500
We had this.

400
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,160
This was all our YouTube kids.

401
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,020
Right here.

402
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,980
This was our Elsa Spider-Man videos.

403
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,740
This was our brain rot.

404
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,220
Alright, let's go.

405
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,180
Yeah, fun for my ADHD brain.

406
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,020
The billboard for the Cartown Zoo.

407
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,760
Oh, that's where I'm going!

408
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,680
I wish the animals were, like...

409
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,600
The animals were...

410
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,880
Oh my gosh, I killed an apple.

411
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,140
And I'll do it again.

412
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,200
I wish, like, the...

413
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,980
The zoo animals were actually, like, cars.

414
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,320
No, they were, like...

415
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,720
Other forms of transportation, not just cars.

416
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,260
Papa had to pop up...

417
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:14,680
No!

418
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,100
Guys, no!

419
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,020
Thank you for the superchat.

420
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,060
Thank you, thank you.

421
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,620
Oh my God, look at that tree.

422
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,080
It's got a precious bark.

423
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:35,510
Oh wait, I remember this one!

424
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:36,430
They start singing!

425
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:37,830
Yay!

426
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,730
Sing for me, animals!

427
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:42,710
Sing!

428
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:48,190
This was my favorite song as a kid.

429
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:19,310
Do the zoo!

430
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:19,890
Zoo!

431
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:21,830
Yeah, roo!

432
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:22,450
Roo!

433
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:22,950
Roo!

434
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,730
Do the zoo!

435
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:31,410
Zoo!

436
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:31,850
Zoo!

437
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:33,790
Roo!

438
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:34,430
Roo!

439
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:35,010
Roo!

440
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,810
Oh my God, Freddy!

441
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,610
Get back to your own game!

442
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,430
Roo, roo, roo.

443
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:04,470
Zoo.

444
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:05,790
Yay!

445
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:13,970
Oh my God, I remember listening to this song so many times as a child.

446
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:16,570
I don't know, it was just such a nice song!

447
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:17,730
Oh, someone...

448
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:17,910
Oh!

449
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,690
Thank you for the superchat.

450
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:20,710
Thank you, thank you.

451
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:23,910
You know, my favorite of these games were the Magic School Bus ones.

452
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,110
Oh my God, I was...

453
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:31,750
Okay, after I failed to get the Blue's Clues treasure hunt game to run, I tried to get...

454
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:35,430
I also owned the Magic School Bus games as well.

455
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,890
Like the Rainforest, the...

456
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:39,930
Rainforest, Dinosaurs...

457
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,230
What was the other one?

458
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:47,850
I had like Rainforest, Dinosaurs, and Space, and then one more Animal one.

459
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:52,090
And I tried to see if I could get those to work, but I also needed...

460
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:55,530
I was like, oh, maybe like someone ported it themselves, you know?

461
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:56,690
I don't know, I'm fucking...

462
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:57,530
I don't know, I'm stupid.

463
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:00,150
I don't know how that works, but...

464
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:04,030
I was like, maybe someone made it so that's compatible for like, you know...

465
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:07,890
For like, the 2025 Windows 11.

466
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:13,010
But sadly, I still had to run a virtual machine, which I have no idea how to do.

467
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:29,730
Don't worry, I got the one bag of food for all the animals in the zoo.

468
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:39,530
Don't worry, this one bag of food is gonna feed the entire country.

469
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,570
I believe it.

470
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:04,350
Oh my god, they got poached?

471
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:09,730
How did the baby animals get out?

472
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:11,370
This is not a very good zoo.

473
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,470
Jackaroo, you're on!

474
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:18,170
Of course, we can't open the zoo until they're all rescued.

475
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:20,370
So, I'm counting on you, Putt-Putt.

476
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:21,190
How did they lose...

477
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:26,570
The thing is, now that I think about it, how did they lose animals on the day it was about to open?

478
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:30,850
Baby Jumbo the elephant, Messiah the giraffe...

479
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:31,590
I'm just like...

480
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:38,610
Kinga the lion cub, Zanzibar the hippopotamus, Sammy Seal, and Little Skeeter the snake.

481
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:44,570
Yeah, he seems remarkably calm for the fact that he literally lost, like, six zoo animals.

482
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:56,030
Yeah, if they lost animals on the fucking day before the zoo opens, I'm not very confident in the zoo.

483
00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:00,510
Like, who's gonna say that they're not gonna break out again?

484
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:03,250
Like, what's stopping them from breaking out?

485
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,970
Yes, can I have some free food, please?

486
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,370
I'm a child.

487
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,590
It's my birthday.

488
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,430
Can I also have this?

489
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:20,130
Because living in Putt-Putt land means that money's not real.

490
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:22,970
And everything is just... you just get it for free.

491
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:24,190
Oh, nice!

492
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,450
I get to keep the fries.

493
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:26,590
Or the Cheez-Its.

494
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:30,550
I wanna live in Putt-Putt world.

495
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:34,730
Everything was on the house.

496
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:36,790
Everything's for free.

497
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:40,230
And I don't think cars have to pay taxes, too.

498
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:47,650
Alright, I need my free stuff over here.

499
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,070
See?

500
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:51,650
Free camera!

501
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:56,250
There's no prices on it, so it has to be free.

502
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:01,290
The gas tax.

503
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:07,350
Free cameras?

504
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:09,350
I want a free camera.

505
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:10,830
I love free stuff.

506
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:14,350
Yay!

507
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:18,990
Oh, so everything's free on opening day?

508
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:21,370
Wait, how do they make...

509
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:26,970
How do they make any money here?

510
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:28,750
Oh my God.

511
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:32,870
Financially, I think... I think the zoo might have to...

512
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:37,710
I think they spent too much money on the singing... the singing bushes.

513
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:40,510
And financially, they're absolutely ruined.

514
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:48,310
Alright, who do we save first?

515
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:51,830
2, 4, 6.

516
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:52,270
Alright.

517
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:54,570
I'll go to... you know what?

518
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,150
I'll go to... oh no, I remember the hockey game.

519
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:58,630
I'll go into Jungle Land.

520
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:01,230
Hello.

521
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:01,530
Hello.

522
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:05,810
Alright, monkey see, monkey do.

523
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:08,290
It's not gonna eat me, right?

524
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:12,270
There's no... wait, how do I...

525
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:18,530
Just use your mouth.

526
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:22,050
Just use your mouth, puppa.

527
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:32,110
The wheels are hands.

528
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:36,130
The wheels are hands?

529
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:42,120
I would...

530
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:46,510
I thought they was gonna use the teeth.

531
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:48,690
Never know when they might come in handy.

532
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:52,950
The wheels are hands?

533
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:59,490
It reminds me...

534
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:02,530
It reminds me of like...

535
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:04,970
Oh, are you doing porridge, Sam?

536
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:10,710
Yeah.

537
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:11,910
Yeah.

538
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:14,790
Woah.

539
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:16,890
That's so deep, man.

540
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:19,830
That's so fucking deep.

541
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:23,490
Anyway, so...

542
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:28,150
Cars trying to hold things reminded me of the whole Cars debate.

543
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:36,670
Where like, animators working on the Cars movie, the Pixar Cars movie, were trying to figure out how would Lightning McQueen hold a map.

544
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:37,530
And...

545
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:44,170
And then they were like, wait, why would Lightning McQueen need to use a map anyway?

546
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:50,430
They had so many ideas on how he would hold a map, like with his tongue.

547
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:54,250
They were drawing concept art of him.

548
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:56,690
Okay, you're the one that ran away.

549
00:45:57,490 --> 00:45:58,410
Shut the fuck up.

550
00:45:58,470 --> 00:45:58,590
Okay.

551
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:05,670
And how a car would physically hold a map.

552
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:10,470
So they're like, okay, but like, what if he uses his tongue to grip it?

553
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:11,550
Or...

554
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:14,550
Oh, now you miss your map.

555
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:18,070
You should have thought about that before you ran away, clearly.

556
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:22,470
I don't remember what the other alternatives were, but...

557
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:24,150
Wait, let me see if I can look it up.

558
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:25,670
Okay, wait, Cars...

559
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:29,370
Cars movie holding map.

560
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:31,950
All I remember was the tongue.

561
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:34,810
Was that a map?

562
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:35,790
Wait, okay.

563
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:39,930
Cars movie, Lightning McQueen...

564
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:42,570
Concept.

565
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,570
Oh my god, I don't remember.

566
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:49,510
Was it actually holding a map or what was it?

567
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:51,090
I'm trying to remember.

568
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:56,130
Like, they were having a huge debate on how to use hands.

569
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:58,830
And like, they gave so many alternatives.

570
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:02,050
Alright, let me just pull this.

571
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:03,410
Oh, I got rid of the rock.

572
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:06,250
That rock is in the way.

573
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,940
Oh, it was a map, yeah.

574
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,160
I remember watching the YouTube video, it was crazy.

575
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,520
Little Skeeter, where are you?

576
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,160
Where did you leave your child?

577
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:26,240
Little Skeeter, where are you?

578
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:31,500
Hello, you must be Mrs. Boa.

579
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,560
I'm Putt-Putt, and I'm looking for the baby animal.

580
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:39,260
Oh, little Putt-Putt, have you found my little Skeeter?

581
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:43,200
I miss him so much, it makes me weep.

582
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,780
I haven't found him yet, but I'll keep my eyes open.

583
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,160
Don't worry, I'll find your little baby.

584
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,920
You are a good little car.

585
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,020
Even though you're a bad mom.

586
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:54,920
I can tell.

587
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,660
Thanks, Mrs. Boa.

588
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,360
Now we can find out all about Boa Constrictors.

589
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,040
Oh, nice.

590
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,240
Boa Constrictors live in Central America and South America.

591
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:08,900
Oh, wow, okay.

592
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,500
Was that my fun fact?

593
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,720
Boas prefer to live in the dampness of the rainforest.

594
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,480
Okay, you know, that's a lot.

595
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,120
I was just like, they live in South America.

596
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:22,700
Oh, okay.

597
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:24,660
That's it?

598
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,760
I'm so educated right now.

599
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:32,080
I feel all the education in my brain processing.

600
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,500
Okay, I can't do the jungle dock yet.

601
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:41,160
Aw man, I need one log?

602
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,800
Oh wait, actually, there's so much wood around me.

603
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:50,580
Where am I gonna find that one piece of log that's the perfect size for it?

604
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,440
Okay, I can't get to here.

605
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,020
I need to go this way.

606
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,200
Alright.

607
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,100
Alright, let's go to the grasslands.

608
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:09,060
Oh look, there it is!

609
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,160
There's my one log!

610
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:11,940
Convenient- Okay, goodbye.

611
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,200
That was just conveniently there.

612
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:16,560
The one log I needed.

613
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:19,100
No, it's not hockey time.

614
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,600
I'm saving hockey time last.

615
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,080
I'm worried it would take me a while to play hockey.

616
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:28,740
It's like the spiral hockey game.

617
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:33,630
Alright.

618
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:40,130
Yay!

619
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:44,770
Alright.

620
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:54,030
Let's go!

621
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:58,790
Oh my god, I can use my own equipment as like...

622
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:09,030
Hot diggity!

623
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:24,190
This was back then when kids were allowed to do stuff outside without parental supervision.

624
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:26,390
And I turned out just fine.

625
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:34,190
I just realized like...

626
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:41,570
This is how the cars are like supposed to transport themselves around this part of the zoo.

627
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:43,990
There's this tiny fucking raft.

628
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:46,870
Like where did the budget go for this zoo?

629
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:50,450
Did we spend it all on the fucking singing- the singing bushes?

630
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:55,130
This tiny raft per boat.

631
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:57,370
We only have one raft here.

632
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:02,950
Did you just say there's only one in Africa?

633
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:12,250
Woah!

634
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:14,650
Oh yeah, hippos can kill a person.

635
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:16,750
Like, I mean like look at the hippo.

636
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:21,590
But hippos are incredibly- Apparently hippos kill more people than sharks.

637
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:24,390
Also, how's the sound so far?

638
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:25,830
I didn't hear sound guys say anything.

639
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:33,430
Alright, let's go to the rapids.

640
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:35,670
Alright,

641
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:39,610
I wanna go this way.

642
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:44,290
Wow, it's safe for all ages.

643
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:47,150
Oh

644
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:57,810
my god, remember to take your child here today so you can almost potentially drown.

645
00:51:58,110 --> 00:51:58,630
Hello!

646
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:04,210
How the fuck did she get up there?

647
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:22,370
Welcome to my- Oh my god Kenya, what happened to your butt?

648
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:26,650
Just jump.

649
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,770
Just jump, it's water.

650
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:29,870
It's just water.

651
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:36,790
She's so tiny, she's so- She was able to jump here, how could she not just jump there?

652
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:41,870
She got semi-deleted.

653
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:44,570
Jump down!

654
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:45,550
Do it!

655
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:48,110
You were able to jump here!

656
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:49,030
You're a cat!

657
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:51,210
You can land on your feet!

658
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:58,550
Hippos kill 500 people each year?!

659
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:01,270
God, thank you for the super chat.

660
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:02,130
Thank you, thank you.

661
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:08,170
Gigantic prey animals tend to be way more aggressive than predators because every fight is life or death in their heads.

662
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:10,330
But predators just want- No, that's so true.

663
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:23,350
I like- I've seen videos of lions that are just sitting there waiting until an animal dies because they're just like- They're like, he'll die eventually.

664
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:28,030
They're just like, no, you know what?

665
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:31,150
Why chase the food when he'll just die?

666
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:37,250
Oh yeah, this should be where the giraffe is.

667
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:41,620
It's okay.

668
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,820
Let's go to- Oh, there it is!

669
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,220
Alright.

670
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:47,220
Come over here.

671
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,520
I'll push the rock with you.

672
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:05,460
Don't worry, I'm a child too.

673
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:09,680
And two children.

674
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,640
One child plus one child equals the strength of two childs.

675
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:18,980
Surely that's strong enough, right?

676
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:30,750
Teamwork, let's go!

677
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:32,490
The strength of two children!

678
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:35,770
How come the rock is so tiny now?

679
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:41,230
This is a job specifically for two children.

680
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:44,490
I know, she was just missing the strength of another child.

681
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:46,950
Yippee!

682
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:56,250
Yeah, I was like, why did the rock- Look!

683
00:54:57,550 --> 00:55:00,090
The rock was being pushed by two children!

684
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:08,590
I do not think it was that big of a- I don't think that rock was that strong in the end.

685
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:11,290
Oh hey, there he is.

686
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:12,450
What is he doing?

687
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:15,450
Is he building fences when the animals are just free-roaming?

688
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:19,790
Oh look, there's the alligators!

689
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:21,190
Or the crocodiles!

690
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:35,050
Why build fences when- This is not- All I'm saying is that this fence is definitely not protecting me when this is- Like, they just stopped halfway.

691
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:37,350
They're like, no worries.

692
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:43,730
This spot- There's no way a car is just gonna drive off here.

693
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:46,250
I have a plan in the way.

694
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:53,570
It's just- It's just a form- It's just aesthetic at this point.

695
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:55,510
Is there anything I can click here?

696
00:55:57,470 --> 00:55:59,270
Oh, look at all the bats!

697
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:03,670
Hello Kenya!

698
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:07,770
Grab my hand!

699
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:09,250
Jump!

700
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:10,750
Jump!

701
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:22,090
What if I just leave her- I wish I could just leave her there.

702
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:26,830
And just be like, never- Never leave mommy!

703
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:29,150
That's what you get!

704
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:31,670
Where does the rapids go?

705
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:32,570
The other side?

706
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:36,630
Alright, let's go.

707
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:37,490
Goodbye.

708
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:40,150
Don't worry, your child's gonna be okay.

709
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:43,550
Go this way.

710
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:46,850
Yippee!

711
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:51,210
Safe for all ages!

712
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:55,810
Oh my god, it's so exciting when your boat is about to leave.

713
00:56:57,950 --> 00:56:59,530
That's the most fun part!

714
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:02,130
Where does this go?

715
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:04,650
Oh, does this like, restart it?

716
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:06,070
Oh yeah, let's do it again.

717
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:06,670
Yippee!

718
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:10,210
They built that there as in like...

719
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:13,010
They expect you to go again.

720
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:16,290
Alright.

721
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:17,830
Come on, you got this papa!

722
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:23,650
Okay, we go this way.

723
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:25,090
Does it lead me anywhere?

724
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:26,610
Oh no, it was the same ride.

725
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:27,590
Woo, again!

726
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:27,970
Again!

727
00:57:34,430 --> 00:57:36,730
Alright, let's try to save the other babies.

728
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:40,270
Alright, one down, five to go.

729
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:41,430
Let's go.

730
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:44,510
Let's help all these neglectful parents.

731
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:47,310
Welcome to the tomato farm!

732
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:48,170
Welcome, welcome!

733
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:52,230
Alright.

734
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:54,430
Yippee!

735
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,180
Oh, thank you for the super chat!

736
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,040
Thank you, thank you!

737
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,900
Papatsi is the most...

738
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:04,960
Thank you for the super chat!

739
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:05,860
Thank you, thank you!

740
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:12,040
By the way, hippos, as said by my oshi, are heavily ATVs that run afate on anything that even has a...

741
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:12,700
Wait, really?

742
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:16,440
So like, you can just exist and they're just like...

743
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:16,800
You know what?

744
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:17,420
Fuck you!

745
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:21,740
Fuck you!

746
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:25,420
Oh, I forgot to...

747
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,660
I was like, where's your daughter?

748
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:29,640
I saved her.

749
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:32,640
And then I remembered I never lowered the gate.

750
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,920
Yeah, you can go over there.

751
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,500
Don't worry about his life.

752
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:53,580
I found her!

753
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:55,040
Anyway, goodbye!

754
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:04,360
Okay.

755
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:08,960
I mean, I hope so.

756
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,280
Hey, I found...

757
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,340
Oh, my poor baby cubby.

758
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,700
They do not look sad at all.

759
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,140
They have three other kids.

760
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,240
Like, it's fine.

761
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:22,620
I don't even need to try.

762
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:28,680
They're scared of that mouse?

763
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:32,060
Okay, let me...

764
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:34,480
They look... They're just... It's like...

765
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,040
My sister is missing.

766
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:38,720
Anyway...

767
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:41,180
Nap time!

768
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:50,730
Life just doesn't seem the same.

769
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:52,370
Not without Kenya.

770
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:54,290
Are you Liu and Leona Lion?

771
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:56,030
Why, yes, we are.

772
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:57,870
I found Kenya.

773
00:59:58,690 --> 00:59:59,690
Where is she?

774
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:00,870
Is she alright?

775
01:00:01,650 --> 01:00:02,530
She's okay.

776
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:05,190
She's stuck on a ledge by the waterfall.

777
01:00:05,610 --> 01:00:06,670
But don't worry.

778
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:10,310
I'll find something that will help her get down safely.

779
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:13,650
Thank you, but... Thank you.

780
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:14,510
Don't worry.

781
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:18,510
She's like, you know, six feet above water.

782
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:20,390
But she's gonna be okay.

783
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:25,610
It's Baby Jumbo.

784
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:27,130
Save me!

785
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,230
Save me!

786
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:31,070
I'm under attack by a giant mouse!

787
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:32,950
A giant mouse?

788
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:37,730
Yeah, he jumped out and scared me.

789
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:39,470
Can you save me?

790
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:40,430
Please!

791
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:42,650
I'll try.

792
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:44,590
Just...

793
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:46,870
Walk around it.

794
01:00:48,590 --> 01:00:50,070
That's his home!

795
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:52,690
He lives there!

796
01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:00,950
Oh my God, this huge mouse.

797
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:03,130
Bro, we're just disturbing his home.

798
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:04,110
He literally lives there.

799
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:05,670
Anyway, I'm pretty sure you want some...

800
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:06,950
You want some chips?

801
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,110
Chips?

802
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:14,750
So big!

803
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:19,530
Oh my God, I basically feed him for the entire year.

804
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:20,830
Okay, never mind.

805
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:37,590
Yeah, go back to your family.

806
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:39,350
Mama?

807
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:39,590
Mama?

808
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:42,230
I have a mom?

809
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:46,490
Oh shit, wrong way.

810
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:48,950
He's just like, mom?

811
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:54,850
Alright, I fed him for the next three hours.

812
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:55,390
You're right.

813
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:57,110
I did my job.

814
01:01:57,870 --> 01:01:59,710
Oh, I can change car colors!

815
01:02:00,010 --> 01:02:00,970
Okay, let me get the shovel.

816
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:03,790
I'm pretty sure I need that for the snow lands.

817
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:06,130
Hello, little bird.

818
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:09,970
Mmm.

819
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:11,990
Mmm.

820
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:13,090
Okay.

821
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:17,550
Why do I look like a green?

822
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:20,110
I'm not... I don't know.

823
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:22,110
I think yellow is gonna be like, so bright.

824
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:28,360
Yay!

825
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:30,060
I'm green now!

826
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:34,540
This is...

827
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:38,320
Oh wait, I could be... I could paint him yellow and remind me of my old dog.

828
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:40,600
A puppet's old dog.

829
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:41,180
Yeah.

830
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,720
Whoa, Pupput.

831
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:47,460
Giving myself those eyes right now.

832
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:48,420
Whoa.

833
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:49,740
Yeah.

834
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,020
That's right, Pupput.

835
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,960
You know you're hot.

836
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:57,180
For a car.

837
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:01,120
Whoa.

838
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,680
Alright, nice.

839
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:07,120
I get to be a yellow car.

840
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,180
Ooh, yeah, shake that.

841
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:10,540
Whoa!

842
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,740
Yeah, Pupput, you sure do.

843
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:14,280
You wanna do that?

844
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:17,560
Whoa.

845
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:19,300
Yeah.

846
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:22,800
Hot ziggity.

847
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:33,660
Let's go.

848
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,800
Alright, let's find the other kids.

849
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:42,960
What are they doing over there?

850
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:47,880
Look at them go.

851
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,240
Look at them do their flippity-floppies.

852
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:53,120
Oh, okay, bye.

853
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,340
Wait, why'd they go?

854
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:55,560
Why'd you run away?

855
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:57,860
Wait, come back!

856
01:03:57,940 --> 01:03:59,720
Is it cuz I'm a yellow car?

857
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:05,060
I was gonna say, is it cuz I'm yellow?

858
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,460
But then I was like, no, Doki.

859
01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:06,560
Doki.

860
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,340
Doki, no.

861
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:15,960
They all left!

862
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:19,800
I painted myself yellow and they all left!

863
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:22,320
Yeah.

864
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:24,560
I wanna play a game.

865
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:25,800
I wanna go!

866
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,280
I'm an adult!

867
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:37,600
I go hard.

868
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:43,040
Don't worry, I got this.

869
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,340
Round 22?

870
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,600
Okay, flamingos.

871
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:50,460
Okay, eight.

872
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:52,900
Wait, that's a lot.

873
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,120
One.

874
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:55,600
Oh, I just clicked!

875
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:57,640
Oh, it's like a speed round.

876
01:04:58,940 --> 01:04:59,300
Okay.

877
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:00,960
Ooh.

878
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:06,960
Oh my god, that's like the classic humongous sound effect.

879
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:09,160
Yay!

880
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:12,120
I found my first flamingo!

881
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:20,160
Yeah, this is how real gamers aim train with Putt-Putt-Save-The-Zoo.

882
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:30,960
Okay, we need two more flamingos.

883
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:34,240
You see how I go back to the center?

884
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:35,920
That's how you aim train.

885
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:40,570
Alright, we got it.

886
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:41,610
We just need one more peacock.

887
01:05:41,790 --> 01:05:42,270
Yay!

888
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:46,790
Yeah, I just clicked on things.

889
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:49,630
Whoa.

890
01:05:54,370 --> 01:05:55,210
Oh.

891
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:01,390
Okay.

892
01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:03,850
Yeah, I'm very sure.

893
01:06:04,890 --> 01:06:06,770
I'm very sure.

894
01:06:08,770 --> 01:06:09,610
Hello.

895
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:16,710
Look, I found your child.

896
01:06:16,990 --> 01:06:18,150
That'll be like $50.

897
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:21,390
You think I'm doing this for free?

898
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:27,470
Yeah, that mouse had a gun.

899
01:06:27,770 --> 01:06:28,250
You're welcome.

900
01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:35,690
It was a very big scary mouse and he was holding a Glock and everything and I literally just saved your child from the mouse.

901
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:40,100
Hello.

902
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:57,590
Wait, who closed the dam?

903
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,190
That's an inside job.

904
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:08,230
Wait.

905
01:07:09,710 --> 01:07:13,370
Someone actually... Someone had to close the dam.

906
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:15,670
It doesn't magically close itself.

907
01:07:16,770 --> 01:07:18,790
Wait, just walk over... Just jump.

908
01:07:19,550 --> 01:07:20,070
Just jump.

909
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:24,690
This is like... This has to be like... Less than one feet.

910
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:26,450
Just... Just jump.

911
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:35,830
It's literally right there.

912
01:07:35,930 --> 01:07:36,390
Oh my god.

913
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:37,550
Guys, what shape was it?

914
01:07:38,550 --> 01:07:39,110
The...

915
01:07:39,110 --> 01:07:40,670
Is it...

916
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:41,690
Oh my god.

917
01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:43,890
It's time to learn about shapes, guys.

918
01:07:44,970 --> 01:07:47,230
The square... The triangle hole.

919
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:51,430
The triangle goes in the square hole.

920
01:07:55,830 --> 01:08:00,310
TikTok taught me that the triangle can go in the square hole.

921
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:02,230
I don't...

922
01:08:08,670 --> 01:08:09,550
But...

923
01:08:11,030 --> 01:08:11,910
But...

924
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:13,950
That's what TikTok told me.

925
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:20,550
Oh, Sammy needs to go...

926
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:22,630
Back to the Ice Land.

927
01:08:25,730 --> 01:08:27,330
Not upstream, right?

928
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:30,950
Oh, yeah.

929
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:32,590
Oh, she has to go that way.

930
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:34,350
Okay, I thought she has to go backwards.

931
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:35,890
I said just jump.

932
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:40,250
It's so far.

933
01:08:42,130 --> 01:08:43,090
Okay, four more.

934
01:08:45,190 --> 01:08:47,250
Alright, we go this way.

935
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:52,970
And then... Okay, now we have to go to the Ice Lands.

936
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:57,610
Wait, can I take pictures of people now?

937
01:08:58,230 --> 01:09:02,590
Wait, actually, can I take pictures of them when they have their kids and they're not sad anymore?

938
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:07,790
Alright, cheese.

939
01:09:08,190 --> 01:09:10,110
Oh, I forgot you can take pictures!

940
01:09:12,990 --> 01:09:14,930
I found your child.

941
01:09:15,170 --> 01:09:15,750
You're welcome.

942
01:09:16,510 --> 01:09:16,530
Aww.

943
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:19,090
Alright, I'm gonna take pictures of the moms crying too.

944
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:26,650
So they can remember the moment they were a bad parent.

945
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:34,930
It's a snapshot moment.

946
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:41,410
This is the moment... Oh, you're smiling because your daughter's missing?

947
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:44,370
Wow, you are a bad mom.

948
01:09:45,210 --> 01:09:47,470
Wait, I'm gonna take pictures of the crying snake!

949
01:09:48,310 --> 01:09:50,310
Alright, where's the snake?

950
01:09:55,110 --> 01:10:00,570
Oh, the snake doesn't know where her daughter is.

951
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:04,570
Hey, can you smile real quick?

952
01:10:06,910 --> 01:10:09,310
It's a snapshot moment.

953
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,120
It's a snapshot moment.

954
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:21,780
Okay, that's...

955
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:29,460
Okay, but like...

956
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:30,660
She's happy!

957
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:35,140
So cute, what?

958
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:37,420
She's happy!

959
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:37,680
She's happy!

960
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:44,300
Oh, shit.

961
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:50,680
I don't know, why didn't you look for... Why didn't you...

962
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:53,220
Is this psychopathic?

963
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:56,280
Girl says thank you for the superchat.

964
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:57,400
Thank you.

965
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,460
All I'm saying is that...

966
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:05,400
She was the one that did not supervise her child properly.

967
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:11,420
I'm gonna take a picture of the...

968
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:16,140
I mean, he's not crying, so it's like not the same.

969
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:23,320
Oh, shit!

970
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:31,100
And then the giraffe is like...

971
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:31,480
Yeah!

972
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:35,840
I want to take a picture of the lion.

973
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:39,660
Alright, say cheese, Kenya!

974
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,820
It's a snapshot moment.

975
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:45,900
The side eye.

976
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:51,180
Hey, say cheese before you do a flip!

977
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:56,580
So cute, what do you mean?

978
01:11:57,340 --> 01:11:59,720
They're the ones that lost their kids!

979
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:08,850
It's not my fault!

980
01:12:09,430 --> 01:12:10,850
They lost their children.

981
01:12:10,990 --> 01:12:12,310
Oh, wait, can I take a picture of this?

982
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:13,310
Oh, I can!

983
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:15,550
Oh,

984
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:21,090
see, everybody's having a good time.

985
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:26,310
Yeah, we need these pictures to send to the CPS.

986
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:29,770
Hurt people, hurt people.

987
01:12:30,310 --> 01:12:32,210
Papa Smurf, thank you for the superchat.

988
01:12:32,270 --> 01:12:32,990
Thank you, thank you.

989
01:12:33,070 --> 01:12:36,090
See, at least some of these animals are having a good time.

990
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:39,490
Monkey.

991
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:43,090
What's in here?

992
01:12:43,390 --> 01:12:44,470
Oh, there's a rope!

993
01:12:49,890 --> 01:12:51,970
Oh, it's so cold.

994
01:12:55,470 --> 01:12:57,250
Get back inside the trunk, dog!

995
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:59,050
It's ice!

996
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:03,170
Oh, he's fine.

997
01:13:05,970 --> 01:13:07,290
Yeah, I'm just boring.

998
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:08,510
Finders keepers.

999
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:12,170
Oh, I got you.

1000
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:16,610
Uh-oh.

1001
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:18,710
Oh, no!

1002
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:22,930
Luckily, I borrowed a shovel.

1003
01:13:27,890 --> 01:13:30,350
Now, how are we gonna get through?

1004
01:13:31,850 --> 01:13:32,930
Don't worry!

1005
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:35,110
From the shovel, I also borrowed!

1006
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:41,070
Yeah, this dude is definitely not safe, guys.

1007
01:13:41,670 --> 01:13:44,090
And they're gonna use a tunnel made by a child.

1008
01:13:45,310 --> 01:13:45,950
Great!

1009
01:13:45,950 --> 01:13:48,550
Now I can keep on driving.

1010
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:50,210
Don't worry!

1011
01:13:50,490 --> 01:13:55,430
Surely the other visitors will not die from an avalanche.

1012
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:57,170
It's very safe.

1013
01:13:58,690 --> 01:13:59,550
Hello there!

1014
01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:06,810
Hey, Skeeter!

1015
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:08,670
Wait, how did you get here?

1016
01:14:10,510 --> 01:14:12,810
How the fuck did he get here?

1017
01:14:15,210 --> 01:14:17,630
Yeah, that snake is dead-dead.

1018
01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:18,930
Don't worry.

1019
01:14:18,930 --> 01:14:21,480
Don't worry.

1020
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:24,610
Anyway.

1021
01:14:25,770 --> 01:14:28,010
Say cheese moments before your death!

1022
01:14:30,530 --> 01:14:31,870
Smile!

1023
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:33,290
You're freezing to death!

1024
01:14:39,740 --> 01:14:40,410
Yay!

1025
01:14:43,170 --> 01:14:43,890
Goodbye.

1026
01:14:43,890 --> 01:14:45,930
Oh my god.

1027
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:47,550
Oh, that sucks, buddy.

1028
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:48,850
Oh, it's hockey time!

1029
01:14:49,170 --> 01:14:50,770
Alright, watch this.

1030
01:14:54,470 --> 01:14:57,090
It's like, it's like pawing.

1031
01:14:57,210 --> 01:14:58,310
Wait, is this pawing?

1032
01:14:59,470 --> 01:15:00,230
Look at that.

1033
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:02,430
I hated this game.

1034
01:15:03,890 --> 01:15:05,990
Wait, you can do that?

1035
01:15:06,110 --> 01:15:07,030
Oh my god, I can hit it!

1036
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:08,750
No!

1037
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:11,950
It's okay.

1038
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:13,310
We got this.

1039
01:15:15,130 --> 01:15:18,790
I don't remember how much you have to score to, like, leave the game.

1040
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:21,850
Oh my god, I'm so bad at this.

1041
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:22,690
Please.

1042
01:15:25,970 --> 01:15:26,570
Yay!

1043
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:30,970
I did it!

1044
01:15:31,650 --> 01:15:32,250
Alright.

1045
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:33,950
Don't worry, I got this.

1046
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:36,250
See, I can pawing.

1047
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:37,730
Yeah!

1048
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:38,030
Oh.

1049
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:40,410
Alright.

1050
01:15:42,150 --> 01:15:43,330
Come on, come on!

1051
01:15:45,650 --> 01:15:46,610
Come on!

1052
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:48,090
Pawing it!

1053
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:51,810
Stop blocking!

1054
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:52,930
That's fucking right.

1055
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:58,890
I could've won and done you, but I didn't, because I didn't see the arrow.

1056
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:00,310
Hey!

1057
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:00,810
Hey!

1058
01:16:03,110 --> 01:16:03,930
Let's go!

1059
01:16:04,170 --> 01:16:04,610
Take a picture!

1060
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:05,130
Snap!

1061
01:16:08,490 --> 01:16:10,990
Bro is missing wide open looks.

1062
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:13,390
He ain't making it to the league.

1063
01:16:13,650 --> 01:16:15,350
He got beat by a child.

1064
01:16:15,570 --> 01:16:16,890
It's long gone for him.

1065
01:16:16,930 --> 01:16:18,070
It's long over for him.

1066
01:16:18,790 --> 01:16:19,370
Hey guys!

1067
01:16:22,190 --> 01:16:23,310
Say cheese!

1068
01:16:23,310 --> 01:16:24,250
Say cheese!

1069
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:27,630
Nice.

1070
01:16:27,870 --> 01:16:30,390
I love my little collection of...

1071
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:33,570
My little collection of children in distress.

1072
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:34,430
Alright.

1073
01:16:38,050 --> 01:16:39,930
Say cheese, little penguins!

1074
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:45,790
Oh, look!

1075
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:46,990
The penguins are happy!

1076
01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:48,730
Alright.

1077
01:16:55,970 --> 01:16:57,110
Alright, penguins!

1078
01:16:57,210 --> 01:16:58,170
Help us out!

1079
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:03,290
Put the pointy... pointy ice over there.

1080
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:03,670
Yay!

1081
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:05,690
You go, penguin!

1082
01:17:06,770 --> 01:17:08,410
That pushed... I like how it's like...

1083
01:17:08,410 --> 01:17:10,810
If I start moving the ice...

1084
01:17:10,810 --> 01:17:13,490
And takes credit for the penguin...

1085
01:17:13,490 --> 01:17:15,450
But the penguins could've done this...

1086
01:17:15,450 --> 01:17:18,130
The penguins could've done this themselves all this time.

1087
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:19,770
They just wanted an audience.

1088
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:27,070
They're just here like...

1089
01:17:27,070 --> 01:17:28,790
Okay, I'm not doing it without a crowd.

1090
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:32,530
Alright.

1091
01:17:32,990 --> 01:17:33,950
Last ice!

1092
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:38,970
Coyote, chill!

1093
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:40,090
Thank you for the super chat!

1094
01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:41,090
Thank you, thank you!

1095
01:17:45,090 --> 01:17:48,990
Just walk on... Wait, is this hippo, like, scared of water?

1096
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:53,110
Whee!

1097
01:17:56,090 --> 01:17:57,650
No strike for you!

1098
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:00,450
Yeah, just that specific penguin.

1099
01:18:11,390 --> 01:18:11,850
Goodbye!

1100
01:18:12,650 --> 01:18:14,230
Oh my god, it's Shred.

1101
01:18:15,130 --> 01:18:16,030
Okay, three more.

1102
01:18:16,050 --> 01:18:17,310
We know where two of them are.

1103
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:19,190
And one of them is freezing to death right now.

1104
01:18:20,090 --> 01:18:21,170
Hello, I found you.

1105
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:23,670
Hello,

1106
01:18:27,090 --> 01:18:28,150
parents I didn't meet.

1107
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:31,090
Amanda, thank you for the super chat!

1108
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:31,910
Thank you, thank you!

1109
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:36,610
Oh, Putt-Putt, we're so grateful you saved our Sammy.

1110
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:39,830
Yes, we missed her so.

1111
01:18:40,370 --> 01:18:41,270
Thank you.

1112
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:42,630
You're welcome.

1113
01:18:43,790 --> 01:18:48,770
We need a sub-quote to add parents arguing in the background.

1114
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:52,430
Are you okay?

1115
01:18:56,030 --> 01:18:58,550
I play these games filled with joy.

1116
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:03,570
Thank you for the super chat!

1117
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:04,790
Thank you, thank you!

1118
01:19:06,770 --> 01:19:10,850
Oh, not even the... Okay, I should take a picture of Ashley happy.

1119
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:13,950
Yay!

1120
01:19:17,290 --> 01:19:18,370
How about these otters?

1121
01:19:18,950 --> 01:19:20,790
Oh, you took pictures of all of them!

1122
01:19:24,290 --> 01:19:25,630
Oh, they're so cool.

1123
01:19:25,990 --> 01:19:27,370
I like how...

1124
01:19:28,690 --> 01:19:30,830
The other one...

1125
01:19:31,490 --> 01:19:33,730
The other one...

1126
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:34,870
Sorry.

1127
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:42,730
They took a picture together, but the seals are like... The seals are like just me and my wife, please.

1128
01:19:43,290 --> 01:19:44,110
Oh wait, there's a ball.

1129
01:19:44,190 --> 01:19:45,030
I should take that.

1130
01:19:46,770 --> 01:19:47,050
Okay.

1131
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:50,690
Let me...

1132
01:19:51,850 --> 01:19:52,830
Oh sorry, seals.

1133
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:54,150
Seals.

1134
01:19:55,970 --> 01:19:58,670
Can I have some of the... Oh, is she gonna do tricks for us?

1135
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:04,180
Oh my God, look at him go.

1136
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:07,400
We can afford to give these seals slides?

1137
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:12,200
But like, we can't afford an actual boat for the rapid rides?

1138
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:17,320
Like, why do they get to have slides?

1139
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:23,520
Alright, here you go.

1140
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:28,500
Also, how the fuck did this snake get over here?

1141
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:33,940
Gotta warm up, little guy!

1142
01:20:37,930 --> 01:20:39,390
A pet saves a zoo.

1143
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:41,470
A pet saves a zoo.

1144
01:20:41,710 --> 01:20:42,130
That's me!

1145
01:20:58,530 --> 01:21:00,050
Yeah, I'm like thinking like...

1146
01:21:02,310 --> 01:21:04,050
I'm just thinking like...

1147
01:21:06,310 --> 01:21:06,870
That...

1148
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:08,550
The polar bears get hockey.

1149
01:21:09,570 --> 01:21:09,930
The...

1150
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:12,850
The zoo guests don't even get a real bridge.

1151
01:21:15,290 --> 01:21:17,350
We don't even get a real bridge.

1152
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:18,670
This was made by me!

1153
01:21:19,610 --> 01:21:21,670
This was... I made this!

1154
01:21:24,110 --> 01:21:25,430
Alright, let's see.

1155
01:21:25,550 --> 01:21:27,010
I got...

1156
01:21:27,010 --> 01:21:31,170
Oh, I need to save... I need to save the giraffe and the lion.

1157
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:35,850
The giraffe I left stranded on the bridge.

1158
01:21:37,390 --> 01:21:38,590
I almost forgot.

1159
01:21:39,210 --> 01:21:40,790
Don't worry, I got you!

1160
01:21:41,810 --> 01:21:44,930
But before I pull the bridge down, say cheese!

1161
01:21:46,790 --> 01:21:47,890
Say cheese!

1162
01:21:51,830 --> 01:21:52,550
Yay!

1163
01:21:54,090 --> 01:21:56,250
Alright, now lower the bridge.

1164
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:06,760
Of course!

1165
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:13,440
Your mom didn't cry for you, by the way.

1166
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:19,190
Bye!

1167
01:22:22,690 --> 01:22:24,930
Alright, oh that's where Kenya is.

1168
01:22:25,450 --> 01:22:26,890
Alright, time to get Kenya!

1169
01:22:26,890 --> 01:22:28,850
Don't say that!

1170
01:22:29,370 --> 01:22:29,730
It's okay.

1171
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:31,830
Those were my inside thoughts.

1172
01:22:32,570 --> 01:22:33,750
That I said out loud.

1173
01:22:34,810 --> 01:22:35,450
Alright, Kenya.

1174
01:22:35,790 --> 01:22:37,210
Let me take a picture down there.

1175
01:22:39,050 --> 01:22:42,050
I wish I could take a picture down like from above.

1176
01:22:42,410 --> 01:22:43,450
A different angle.

1177
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:51,640
Go Kenya, go!

1178
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:52,900
Oh, that was scary.

1179
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:55,860
My Lion King OC.

1180
01:22:58,740 --> 01:22:59,580
Shh.

1181
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:03,700
I did it!

1182
01:23:04,820 --> 01:23:05,560
Yay!

1183
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:15,560
I did it!

1184
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:20,080
Outback, I did it!

1185
01:23:26,530 --> 01:23:29,570
I did it!

1186
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:33,850
It's almost like...

1187
01:23:33,850 --> 01:23:35,530
The adults could have done it themselves.

1188
01:23:46,610 --> 01:23:47,610
That's me!

1189
01:23:54,610 --> 01:23:55,710
Not money?

1190
01:23:56,110 --> 01:23:57,390
For doing your job?

1191
01:23:59,130 --> 01:24:00,270
Oh, great!

1192
01:24:00,950 --> 01:24:01,990
A one dollar medal.

1193
01:24:02,570 --> 01:24:04,250
That guy from Dollar Tree.

1194
01:24:11,790 --> 01:24:12,490
Yay!

1195
01:24:19,470 --> 01:24:21,630
Look at all these other tiny cars.

1196
01:24:23,570 --> 01:24:25,110
Yeah, chat lady!

1197
01:24:25,110 --> 01:24:25,650
Yay!

1198
01:24:26,010 --> 01:24:27,030
Hot ziggity!

1199
01:24:31,830 --> 01:24:33,570
It's been more than half an hour.

1200
01:24:33,730 --> 01:24:34,350
You said so.

1201
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:35,770
Doki's adult pronouns revoked.

1202
01:24:35,890 --> 01:24:36,650
Oh no!

1203
01:24:37,330 --> 01:24:39,410
I can't be an adult anymore!

1204
01:24:40,170 --> 01:24:43,190
How would I pay my adult taxes?

1205
01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:44,330
Oh no!

1206
01:24:45,710 --> 01:24:46,910
Oh no!

1207
01:24:49,810 --> 01:24:51,510
These are all the photos I took.

1208
01:24:53,270 --> 01:24:54,630
Oh, there's the mouse.

1209
01:24:54,810 --> 01:24:56,310
Oh, there's my medal that I'm showing!

1210
01:24:56,650 --> 01:24:57,970
Oh, what a shame!

1211
01:25:01,210 --> 01:25:02,850
Okay guys, before...

1212
01:25:02,850 --> 01:25:04,170
I still want to...

1213
01:25:04,170 --> 01:25:06,550
I realized I forgot to do one thing in this game.

1214
01:25:07,070 --> 01:25:09,650
I want to take pictures of all the moms crying.

1215
01:25:14,450 --> 01:25:15,910
There's nothing wrong with me, guys.

1216
01:25:16,210 --> 01:25:17,750
There's nothing wrong with me, I swear to God.

1217
01:25:21,530 --> 01:25:23,530
Oh, it's the voice actor!

1218
01:25:24,130 --> 01:25:25,150
What are you doing now?

1219
01:25:25,510 --> 01:25:27,070
Oh my God, there's...

I feel really good to have an after game chat with you guys.

1286
01:32:50,230 --> 01:32:52,290
Since it has been a while since we've done this.

1287
01:32:52,390 --> 01:32:53,670
And also doing super chat reading.

1288
01:32:53,850 --> 01:32:55,510
Oh my god, it's been so long!

1289
01:32:55,830 --> 01:32:57,070
It actually has!

1290
01:32:58,110 --> 01:33:01,050
But, I think I've recovered long enough.

1291
01:33:01,670 --> 01:33:03,770
And my health feels a lot better now.

1292
01:33:04,270 --> 01:33:07,130
Compared to, like, what it was, like, the last half year.

1293
01:33:07,410 --> 01:33:09,430
So I'm really happy to just hang out with you guys.

1294
01:33:09,590 --> 01:33:10,450
Post stream.

1295
01:33:10,650 --> 01:33:11,290
Post game.

1296
01:33:11,810 --> 01:33:12,450
But yeah!

1297
01:33:12,970 --> 01:33:15,290
I want to do, like, I do want to, at one point...

1298
01:33:16,870 --> 01:33:20,030
I want to do a marathon of, like, some humongous games.

1299
01:33:20,630 --> 01:33:23,750
Of, like, a bunch of humongous games at once, too.

1300
01:33:23,810 --> 01:33:25,070
I think that would be really fun to do.

1301
01:33:25,110 --> 01:33:26,890
And just play, like, a whole collection of them.

1302
01:33:27,850 --> 01:33:30,250
A whole collection of them for you guys.

1303
01:33:31,370 --> 01:33:36,370
Also, I saw someone say earlier that there might be, like, an easier way to...

1304
01:33:36,370 --> 01:33:38,970
I saw someone in super chat saying there might be an easier way to run.

1305
01:33:39,790 --> 01:33:40,350
Um...

1306
01:33:40,350 --> 01:33:45,210
To run some of these old PC games.

1307
01:33:45,350 --> 01:33:51,250
Because I really do want to play Blue's Clues, Treasure Hunt, and the Magic School Bus games with you guys on stream.

1308
01:33:51,510 --> 01:33:52,390
Um, it's crazy.

1309
01:33:52,430 --> 01:33:53,670
I was looking up how to play.

1310
01:33:54,810 --> 01:33:58,830
And, like, the only channel that was, like...

1311
01:33:59,450 --> 01:34:00,550
There's a channel.

1312
01:34:00,910 --> 01:34:07,990
I found a channel that, like, posts Let's Plays videos of all these, like, childhood games on PC.

1313
01:34:07,990 --> 01:34:13,110
And it's, like, a Christian... It was, like, a Christian family friendly channel.

1314
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:20,030
And, like, she has, like, an entire, like, catalogue of all these, like, children games I played growing up.

1315
01:34:20,290 --> 01:34:23,410
Like, she was, like, she did, like, playthroughs of, like, the...

1316
01:34:23,410 --> 01:34:24,170
What was it?

1317
01:34:24,190 --> 01:34:25,470
It was, like, the math games.

1318
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:27,230
And then I was watching...

1319
01:34:27,230 --> 01:34:29,350
I was, like... Because I was, like, going through nostalgia.

1320
01:34:29,770 --> 01:34:31,910
I was watching, like, um...

1321
01:34:31,910 --> 01:34:33,830
One of the math games.

1322
01:34:34,070 --> 01:34:35,590
I was, like, what is that?

1323
01:34:35,970 --> 01:34:36,890
It looked so hard.

1324
01:34:36,890 --> 01:34:38,870
I was thinking about, like...

1325
01:34:38,870 --> 01:34:40,950
I was, like, oh, maybe I can get that game to work.

1326
01:34:41,050 --> 01:34:42,010
I'll try that in the future.

1327
01:34:42,210 --> 01:34:45,870
And then I watched a playthrough of, like, 5th grade level math game.

1328
01:34:45,990 --> 01:34:46,810
I don't remember what it's called.

1329
01:34:46,950 --> 01:34:49,190
Like, that series where, um...

1330
01:34:49,190 --> 01:34:50,110
God, I'm trying to say.

1331
01:34:50,210 --> 01:34:50,850
What was it?

1332
01:34:51,230 --> 01:34:55,650
5th grade level math game.

1333
01:34:57,350 --> 01:34:57,750
Uh...

1334
01:34:57,750 --> 01:34:59,210
CD-ROM.

1335
01:35:01,230 --> 01:35:02,030
Oh, Jumpstart!

1336
01:35:02,250 --> 01:35:03,710
Yes, Jumpstart games!

1337
01:35:03,710 --> 01:35:04,910
Oh, my God.

1338
01:35:05,090 --> 01:35:07,990
I saw a playthrough of those, like...

1339
01:35:07,990 --> 01:35:08,790
Like the...

1340
01:35:08,790 --> 01:35:09,790
Or was it ClueFinders?

1341
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:10,730
It was ClueFinders.

1342
01:35:10,810 --> 01:35:11,630
Sorry, it wasn't Jumpstart.

1343
01:35:11,950 --> 01:35:13,430
It was ClueFinders.

1344
01:35:13,790 --> 01:35:14,950
And, um...

1345
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:20,090
I saw the 5th grade adventure ClueFinders.

1346
01:35:20,370 --> 01:35:22,710
And I was, like, watching the playthrough of it.

1347
01:35:22,790 --> 01:35:24,050
And I was, like...

1348
01:35:24,050 --> 01:35:26,230
I can't expose myself like this.

1349
01:35:26,590 --> 01:35:27,610
On stream.

1350
01:35:28,990 --> 01:35:29,990
I was, like...

1351
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:36,450
I will not willingly expose myself with 5th grade adventure.

1352
01:35:36,850 --> 01:35:39,990
We've already played Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader.

1353
01:35:40,470 --> 01:35:40,930
There...

1354
01:35:42,850 --> 01:35:44,130
I saw...

1355
01:35:44,130 --> 01:35:45,470
I was watching the Let's Play.

1356
01:35:45,550 --> 01:35:47,930
And those questions were, like...

1357
01:35:47,930 --> 01:35:49,170
I was, like, there's no way.

1358
01:35:49,350 --> 01:35:50,950
I was, like...

1359
01:35:50,950 --> 01:35:52,710
I was, like...

1360
01:35:52,710 --> 01:35:53,570
What the fuck?

1361
01:35:53,650 --> 01:35:55,890
What am I watching right now?

1362
01:35:56,910 --> 01:35:59,170
There were so many numbers.

1363
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:00,130
Oh...

1364
01:36:05,050 --> 01:36:06,970
But, yeah.

1365
01:36:07,050 --> 01:36:07,270
Anyway.

1366
01:36:07,410 --> 01:36:09,330
Let me pull up my Super Chats.

1367
01:36:09,990 --> 01:36:10,450

1368
01:36:11,170 --> 01:36:12,850

1369
01:36:12,850 --> 01:36:13,370

1370
01:36:13,370 --> 01:36:14,690
I'm gonna tell you guys right now.

1371
01:36:15,010 --> 01:36:17,850
There will not be a rival stream tonight.

1372
01:36:18,270 --> 01:36:21,030
I am gonna chill tonight, guys.

1373
01:36:21,290 --> 01:36:23,070
There is no rival stream.

1374
01:36:23,570 --> 01:36:25,690
So, you don't have to camp out.

1375
01:36:25,850 --> 01:36:29,030
You don't have to camp out in the trenches on Twitch.

1376
01:36:29,030 --> 01:36:29,570
Guys.

1377
01:36:30,110 --> 01:36:31,030
Oh, my gosh.

1378
01:36:31,130 --> 01:36:33,030

1379
01:36:33,310 --> 01:36:33,850
Like, did a Super...

1380

1381
01:36:34,490 --> 01:36:36,450
It's been so long since I did a Super Chat reading.

1382
01:36:37,570 --> 01:36:38,570

1391
01:36:46,290 --> 01:36:47,890
I should do, like, Super Chat reading.

1392
01:36:51,910 --> 01:36:52,870
Here's the texting.

1393
01:36:53,910 --> 01:36:54,630
Insert text.

1394
01:36:56,590 --> 01:36:57,270
Uh...

1395
01:36:57,270 --> 01:36:58,950
Do I have, like...

1396
01:36:58,950 --> 01:36:59,570
Oh, I don't.

1397
01:36:59,670 --> 01:36:59,870
Okay.

1398
01:37:00,470 --> 01:37:01,590
Great news.

1399
01:37:02,370 --> 01:37:04,410
Donation reading time.

1400
01:37:05,490 --> 01:37:05,830
Alright.

1401
01:37:06,150 --> 01:37:07,330
Oh, it's been so long.

1402
01:37:08,130 --> 01:37:09,590
I almost forgot what it's like.

1403
01:37:11,170 --> 01:37:11,610
Okay.

1404
01:37:13,150 --> 01:37:14,190
There we go.

1405
01:37:14,550 --> 01:37:15,630
Put it...

1406
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:17,430
Put it here.

1407
01:37:17,530 --> 01:37:18,390
Donation reading.

1408
01:37:19,850 --> 01:37:20,450
Put it here.

1409
01:37:20,930 --> 01:37:21,910
Put it here.

1410
01:37:22,210 --> 01:37:23,130
Put it here.

1411
01:37:23,590 --> 01:37:24,310
Put it here.

1412
01:37:25,150 --> 01:37:26,690
I'll put it underneath the chat.

1413
01:37:26,790 --> 01:37:27,450
No, that's smart.

1414
01:37:27,810 --> 01:37:28,110
Here.

1415
01:37:32,330 --> 01:37:32,810
Alright.

1416
01:37:33,150 --> 01:37:33,950
I'll do it here.

1417
01:37:34,130 --> 01:37:34,310
Yeah.

1418
01:37:34,750 --> 01:37:35,030
Alright.

1419
01:37:36,030 --> 01:37:36,930
Hi, Doki.

1420
01:37:37,230 --> 01:37:38,670
Also, Michael, thank you for the Super Chat.

1421
01:37:38,770 --> 01:37:38,990
Thank you.

1422
01:37:39,250 --> 01:37:39,710
Thank you.

1423
01:37:43,430 --> 01:37:44,230
Hi, Doki.

1424
01:37:44,370 --> 01:37:46,550
As a Cantonese, I must ask...

1425
01:37:46,550 --> 01:37:49,130
What's your favorite Chinese barbecue dish?

1426
01:37:49,510 --> 01:37:51,810
Duck, chicken, pork, or something else?

1427
01:37:54,970 --> 01:37:57,070
I think my favorite has to be...

1428
01:37:57,070 --> 01:37:58,690
Duck with the sweet sauce.

1429
01:37:58,830 --> 01:37:59,810
I don't know what it's called.

1430
01:38:00,210 --> 01:38:00,990
Or char siu.

1431
01:38:01,310 --> 01:38:03,890
It's either char siu or the duck with the sweet sauce.

1432
01:38:05,170 --> 01:38:06,810
But yeah, thank you for the Super Chat.

1433
01:38:06,910 --> 01:38:07,810
Thank you, thank you.

1434
01:38:08,730 --> 01:38:10,330
Anton, thank you for the Super Chat.

1435
01:38:10,430 --> 01:38:11,370
Thank you, thank you.

1436
01:38:12,810 --> 01:38:14,770
Pain is weakness leaving the body.

1437
01:38:14,910 --> 01:38:15,790
Thank you for the Super Chat.

1438
01:38:15,870 --> 01:38:16,510
Thank you, thank you.

1439
01:38:17,210 --> 01:38:18,390
MrBrokenBot, thank you for the Super Chat.

1440
01:38:18,510 --> 01:38:19,370
Thank you, thank you.

1441
01:38:19,770 --> 01:38:22,010
More money, more problems.

1442
01:38:22,630 --> 01:38:23,490
Thank you for the Super Chat.

1443
01:38:23,490 --> 01:38:24,250
Thank you, thank you.

1444
01:38:24,290 --> 01:38:25,170
What's duck like?

1445
01:38:27,270 --> 01:38:32,070
The meat is a lot harder to chew for duck.

1446
01:38:33,690 --> 01:38:36,230
But it's really juicy.

1447
01:38:38,370 --> 01:38:42,210
If you guys ever had Peking Duck, which is very, very expensive.

1448
01:38:42,710 --> 01:38:46,050
It's one of the most expensive things you can order.

1449
01:38:47,070 --> 01:38:48,550
Chinese dish you can order.

1450
01:38:48,550 --> 01:38:49,750
And it has like...

1451
01:38:50,610 --> 01:38:54,710
The way they prepare it also takes a long time too.

1452
01:38:55,230 --> 01:38:57,690
But it's very, very juicy and tender.

1453
01:38:58,110 --> 01:39:00,350
Yeah, there's a lot of oil to it.

1454
01:39:00,550 --> 01:39:01,430
I've always wondered...

1455
01:39:03,790 --> 01:39:04,830
Because like...

1456
01:39:04,830 --> 01:39:06,550
There's a lot of like...

1457
01:39:06,550 --> 01:39:08,510
Wait, okay, is yu ga pigeons?

1458
01:39:09,070 --> 01:39:09,750
Wait, yu...

1459
01:39:11,530 --> 01:39:12,050
Pigeon...

1460
01:39:12,050 --> 01:39:12,550
Meat...

1461
01:39:13,090 --> 01:39:13,850
What's yu ga?

1462
01:39:14,110 --> 01:39:14,870
Is it squab?

1463
01:39:15,030 --> 01:39:15,650
Okay, yeah.

1464
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:16,550
Alright, so...

1465
01:39:17,350 --> 01:39:18,190
It's also...

1466
01:39:18,550 --> 01:39:21,070
Whenever I see pigeons, I'm like...

1467
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:27,910
Pigeon...

1468
01:39:27,910 --> 01:39:29,370
But like, there's so many pigeons.

1469
01:39:29,490 --> 01:39:30,210
Because like...

1470
01:39:30,210 --> 01:39:34,550
It's funny because you don't see a lot of pigeons in Asia a lot.

1471
01:39:34,890 --> 01:39:38,470
Because pigeons are like a delicacy in Asia.

1472
01:39:39,190 --> 01:39:42,210
They're actually really, really, really good.

1473
01:39:42,710 --> 01:39:43,870
And then so like...

1474
01:39:43,870 --> 01:39:45,470
I remember like...

1475
01:39:45,470 --> 01:39:48,450
Just seeing all these pigeons alive.

1476
01:39:48,450 --> 01:39:51,710
Roaming around in NA.

1477
01:39:52,210 --> 01:39:53,310
And I'm like...

1478
01:39:53,310 --> 01:39:54,090
What a waste.

1479
01:39:54,510 --> 01:39:56,630
What a...

1480
01:39:58,970 --> 01:40:00,490
I'm like...

1481
01:40:00,490 --> 01:40:02,810
What a waste of good pigeons.

1482
01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:06,430
It's true.

1483
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:09,470
They're really, really good.

1484
01:40:09,830 --> 01:40:10,870
I swear to God.

1485
01:40:10,930 --> 01:40:12,250
If you ever have a chance...

1486
01:40:12,630 --> 01:40:14,110
You need to order like...

1487
01:40:14,670 --> 01:40:15,290
Pigeon meat.

1488
01:40:18,810 --> 01:40:21,330
Yeah, they're like everywhere in NA.

1489
01:40:21,610 --> 01:40:24,350
But if you see these pigeons fly in Asia...

1490
01:40:24,350 --> 01:40:26,210
You know they're gonna be caught and roasted.

1491
01:40:29,310 --> 01:40:31,570
No, it's true.

1492
01:40:31,990 --> 01:40:33,030
It's so...

1493
01:40:33,030 --> 01:40:34,810
You do not see wild pigeons.

1494
01:40:35,010 --> 01:40:37,650
You don't see wild pigeons in Asia.

1495
01:40:38,030 --> 01:40:39,310
Because it's too...

1496
01:40:39,310 --> 01:40:40,870
It's too much of a waste.

1497
01:40:41,310 --> 01:40:41,830
To eat...

1498
01:40:41,830 --> 01:40:43,510
To not eat them.

1499
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:45,270
Yeah, but thank you for the...

1500
01:40:45,270 --> 01:40:46,950
Thank you.

1501
01:40:46,950 --> 01:40:48,750
I believe you.

1502
01:40:52,410 --> 01:40:53,610
They're like...

1503
01:40:53,610 --> 01:40:54,210
They're like...

1504
01:40:54,210 --> 01:40:56,470
Pigeons are mostly kept in...

1505
01:40:56,470 --> 01:40:57,230
Yeah, I'm like...

1506
01:40:57,230 --> 01:40:58,070
Oh, free food.

1507
01:40:58,210 --> 01:40:58,770
Free pigeon.

1508
01:41:01,830 --> 01:41:04,110
But like, we actually...

1509
01:41:04,110 --> 01:41:06,430
I just remember when like...

1510
01:41:06,430 --> 01:41:07,470
I used to live in Asia.

1511
01:41:07,650 --> 01:41:08,610
And I was like...

1512
01:41:09,550 --> 01:41:11,670
No pigeons around here.

1513
01:41:13,830 --> 01:41:14,710
I'm just like...

1514
01:41:16,170 --> 01:41:18,530
Because like, you know, from NA to Asia...

1515
01:41:18,530 --> 01:41:19,930
You know, there's wild pigeons everywhere.

1516
01:41:20,170 --> 01:41:22,410
On the streets just roaming around getting food.

1517
01:41:22,610 --> 01:41:24,350
But then when you're in Asia, you're just like...

1518
01:41:24,350 --> 01:41:25,750
Wow, there's like crows.

1519
01:41:25,990 --> 01:41:27,630
But where did all the pigeons go?

1520
01:41:33,250 --> 01:41:35,270
They're very expensive too, guys.

1521
01:41:35,330 --> 01:41:35,930
That's the thing.

1522
01:41:36,890 --> 01:41:37,770
They're extremely...

1523
01:41:37,770 --> 01:41:39,150
Not extremely, but they're one of the...

1524
01:41:39,150 --> 01:41:40,450
They're very expensive too.

1525
01:41:40,450 --> 01:41:44,290
So like, to see all those wild and free pigeons in NA...

1526
01:41:44,290 --> 01:41:45,690
And I'm just like...

1527
01:41:50,130 --> 01:41:52,490
We gotta eat or use it for a race.

1528
01:41:52,850 --> 01:41:54,630
Thank you for the super chat.

1529
01:41:54,730 --> 01:41:55,310
Thank you, thank you.

1530
01:41:55,330 --> 01:41:55,870
Yeah, they are.

1531
01:41:55,950 --> 01:41:57,450
They're very expensive in...

1532
01:41:58,870 --> 01:42:00,490
I wouldn't say very, very expensive.

1533
01:42:00,630 --> 01:42:02,450
But they are like an expensive cuisine...

1534
01:42:03,850 --> 01:42:04,650
In Asia.

1535
01:42:05,030 --> 01:42:06,330
And they're really, really good.

1536
01:42:06,410 --> 01:42:08,210
If you ever have a chance to, you should try it out.

1537
01:42:11,550 --> 01:42:12,350
Let's see...

1538
01:42:12,350 --> 01:42:14,550
Not the wild ones out in the street.

1539
01:42:14,630 --> 01:42:16,450
But like an actual prepared...

1540
01:42:19,550 --> 01:42:20,350
Actually prepared...

1541
01:42:23,370 --> 01:42:25,550
I got your DeviantArt right here.

1542
01:42:25,690 --> 01:42:26,190
Pants grab.

1543
01:42:26,310 --> 01:42:27,010
Thank you for the super chat.

1544
01:42:27,090 --> 01:42:27,910
Thank you, thank you.

1545
01:42:28,150 --> 01:42:28,670
No name.

1546
01:42:28,730 --> 01:42:29,690
When was the BLR?

1547
01:42:29,770 --> 01:42:30,610
Thank you for the super chat.

1548
01:42:30,710 --> 01:42:31,330
Thank you, thank you.

1549
01:42:31,390 --> 01:42:32,690
When I discovered Tumblr.

1550
01:42:33,270 --> 01:42:35,310
That's when I went downhill.

1551
01:42:35,710 --> 01:42:37,590
So like, the cycle was like...

1552
01:42:37,590 --> 01:42:39,190
Okay, here's the actual full cycle.

1553
01:42:39,190 --> 01:42:40,250
From what I remember.

1554
01:42:40,590 --> 01:42:41,650
Okay, Neopets.

1555
01:42:41,990 --> 01:42:43,310
My cycle on the internet.

1556
01:42:43,990 --> 01:42:44,350
Neopets.

1557
01:42:47,170 --> 01:42:48,610
Then DeviantArt.

1558
01:42:49,250 --> 01:42:52,990
And then from DeviantArt, I found out about Tumblr.

1559
01:42:53,530 --> 01:42:57,710
And then from Tumblr, I found out about Archive of Our Own.

1560
01:42:58,210 --> 01:42:58,630
Oh wait, sorry.

1561
01:43:00,970 --> 01:43:01,690
DeviantArt.

1562
01:43:02,750 --> 01:43:04,150
Fanfiction.net.

1563
01:43:06,290 --> 01:43:07,010
Tumblr.

1564
01:43:08,090 --> 01:43:09,670
Archive of Our Own.

1565
01:43:12,380 --> 01:43:13,220
Twitter.

1566
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:19,580
Twitter.

1567
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:22,940
And then, we're here.

1568
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:23,960
This is where we are.

1569
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:27,460
We're here now.

1570
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:34,200
The full journey.

1571
01:43:35,220 --> 01:43:37,420
I was not a super hula.

1572
01:43:37,420 --> 01:43:39,600
Because I didn't watch Doctor Who.

1573
01:43:39,780 --> 01:43:40,640
So I was saved.

1574
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:41,660
A little bit.

1575
01:43:41,980 --> 01:43:48,420
I was, unfortunately, a fan of Sherlock.

1576
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:51,380
And Supernatural.

1577
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:53,320
Before things went down.

1578
01:43:53,380 --> 01:43:56,780
Before like, Castiel came back for the seventh time.

1579
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:06,100
And also, unfortunately, a Sherlock fan.

1580
01:44:06,100 --> 01:44:10,740
Before I thought that like, maybe the Mind Palace thing is a little stupid.

1581
01:44:12,660 --> 01:44:14,980
You know when he does like...

1582
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:17,140
Like the Mind Palace thing, he's like...

1583
01:44:18,740 --> 01:44:20,500
And then I'm like, oh my god, that's so cool.

1584
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:24,180
And then like, you know, a couple years later, I was like...

1585
01:44:24,180 --> 01:44:26,580
Maybe that wasn't as cool as I thought it was.

1586
01:44:29,300 --> 01:44:31,200
Season 1 and 2 were good.

1587
01:44:31,300 --> 01:44:32,420
I like season...

1588
01:44:32,420 --> 01:44:34,500
When they killed off Moriarty.

1589
01:44:36,100 --> 01:44:39,060
That's when the show got worse, I think.

1590
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:39,940
I think...

1591
01:44:39,940 --> 01:44:43,280
Because I know like, you know, they're supposed to kill off Moriarty.

1592
01:44:43,660 --> 01:44:44,100
But like...

1593
01:44:46,300 --> 01:44:47,340
Okay, so...

1594
01:44:47,340 --> 01:44:51,380
The reason why I was like, oh, when they killed off Moriarty, the show got worse.

1595
01:44:51,660 --> 01:44:52,120
Is because...

1596
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:55,100
The reasoning they explained...

1597
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,660
Because, you know, Sherlock fakes his death so many times.

1598
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:02,660
And like, he fakes his death in the original book by...

1599
01:45:04,060 --> 01:45:06,720
Spoiler alert, from a book that was written in the 1800s.

1600
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:11,920
Sherlock...

1601
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:13,900
Fakes his death.

1602
01:45:15,300 --> 01:45:16,920
And like, he comes back.

1603
01:45:17,180 --> 01:45:19,020
But like, in the original books...

1604
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:22,320
The author actually wanted him to be dead.

1605
01:45:22,620 --> 01:45:24,640
So he like, tried to kill him off.

1606
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:26,460
Because he was done with Sherlock.

1607
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:28,460
He was like, I want to write other things.

1608
01:45:28,460 --> 01:45:29,640
And then...

1609
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:32,400
And then like, his fans back then...

1610
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:33,520
Like, you know, just like today...

1611
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:36,140
Fandom culture is always the same.

1612
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:37,740
Send him death threats.

1613
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:38,540
And...

1614
01:45:41,740 --> 01:45:43,180
You know, the usual.

1615
01:45:47,060 --> 01:45:47,660
Just...

1616
01:45:47,660 --> 01:45:49,960
You know, just the usual fan behavior.

1617
01:45:51,620 --> 01:45:53,480
Like they normally do.

1618
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:54,920
They...

1619
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:55,760
Send him...

1620
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:56,940
Send Arthur...

1621
01:45:56,940 --> 01:45:57,420
What's his name?

1622
01:45:57,420 --> 01:45:58,560
Arthur Cullen...

1623
01:45:58,560 --> 01:45:59,020
Doyle?

1624
01:45:59,220 --> 01:46:00,560
Send him death threats.

1625
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:02,080
It was like, bring back Sherlock.

1626
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:04,600
He can't just be dead.

1627
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:07,460
Ah, yes.

1628
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:08,320
The tradition.

1629
01:46:11,140 --> 01:46:13,440
Some things are as true as time.

1630
01:46:14,380 --> 01:46:15,500
Nothing ever...

1631
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:16,720
Nothing ever changes.

1632
01:46:21,460 --> 01:46:22,020
Anyway...

1633
01:46:22,020 --> 01:46:22,600
So...

1634
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:23,500
So, and then...

1635
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:24,600
Because, you know...

1636
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:26,460
The author was like, you know, tired of...

1637
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:28,280
Fearing for his life.

1638
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:30,120
Which is normal to feel like.

1639
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:31,480
Especially in the 1800s.

1640
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:32,720
Because, you know...

1641
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:34,540
Murder was so easy to get away with.

1642
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:35,720
Back then...

1643
01:46:37,240 --> 01:46:38,140
You know...

1644
01:46:38,140 --> 01:46:40,820
Back then, murder was very easy to get away with.

1645
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:42,100
So, you know...

1646
01:46:42,100 --> 01:46:42,480
The author...

1647
01:46:43,020 --> 01:46:43,980
Fearing for his life.

1648
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:45,460
Was like...

1649
01:46:47,980 --> 01:46:48,900
Teehee, JK.

1650
01:46:49,700 --> 01:46:51,240
Sherlock's actually alive.

1651
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:52,620
He faked his death, guys.

1652
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:00,020
So, yeah.

1653
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:00,820
So, he's like...

1654
01:47:00,820 --> 01:47:02,360
He actually faked his death.

1655
01:47:02,440 --> 01:47:03,820
He's not dead, guys.

1656
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:06,640
The greatest detective...

1657
01:47:06,640 --> 01:47:07,900
Died that easily.

1658
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:12,960
Just kidding.

1659
01:47:13,480 --> 01:47:13,820
So, yes.

1660
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:14,660
Anyway, so, you know...

1661
01:47:14,660 --> 01:47:17,860
There's so many adaptations...

1662
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:20,040
Of where...

1663
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:21,960
You know, Sherlock has to fake his death.

1664
01:47:22,380 --> 01:47:23,400
And so...

1665
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:24,540
When the...

1666
01:47:24,540 --> 01:47:26,440
Modern day adaption...

1667
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:27,600
Adaptation...

1668
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:30,940
Adaptation...

1669
01:47:30,940 --> 01:47:31,440
Of Sherlock...

1670
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:33,260
With like, you know...

1671
01:47:33,260 --> 01:47:35,680
Bendy Legs Cabbage Patch.

1672
01:47:36,040 --> 01:47:37,880
And his duo, Martin Freeman.

1673
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:43,860
Their...

1674
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:46,140
Solution...

1675
01:47:46,140 --> 01:47:47,580
To faking his death...

1676
01:47:47,580 --> 01:47:48,620
And how it was done.

1677
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:49,860
And the thing is...

1678
01:47:49,860 --> 01:47:52,440
In season 2...

1679
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:53,520
There were...

1680
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:55,500
Before season 3 came out...

1681
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:56,510
There were so many...

1682
01:47:57,320 --> 01:47:57,690
Fan theories...

1683
01:47:58,540 --> 01:47:59,880
Of how...

1684
01:48:01,020 --> 01:48:01,720
Bumblebee...

1685
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:02,940
Chroma...

1686
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:04,200
Chroma...

1687
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:07,920
Bumblebee come...

1688
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:08,520
Dungeon.

1689
01:48:17,330 --> 01:48:17,880
Oh, yeah.

1690
01:48:18,020 --> 01:48:19,600
There is a...

1691
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:20,760
Bendy...

1692
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:21,140
Oh, my God.

1693
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:22,480
What is his actual name anymore?

1694
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:25,980
Oh, Cumberbatch.

1695
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:26,380
Okay.

1696
01:48:28,760 --> 01:48:29,320
Okay.

1697
01:48:29,500 --> 01:48:31,180
Bendy Cumberbatch...

1698
01:48:31,180 --> 01:48:32,280
Name Generator.

1699
01:48:32,540 --> 01:48:33,880
Does it still exist?

1700
01:48:34,180 --> 01:48:35,340
This was my...

1701
01:48:35,340 --> 01:48:36,240
Oh, my God.

1702
01:48:36,280 --> 01:48:37,140
It still exists.

1703
01:48:37,780 --> 01:48:38,660
This was my...

1704
01:48:38,660 --> 01:48:40,160
This was back in the Tumblr era.

1705
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:41,740
They actually still have it.

1706
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:42,800
Don't you know?

1707
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:45,320
He's a respected actor.

1708
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:46,180
Okay.

1709
01:48:46,380 --> 01:48:48,180
So, if there was a generator...

1710
01:48:48,180 --> 01:48:49,500
And then you could get like...

1711
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:51,500
Syphilis Candlestick...

1712
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:52,460
Or Bandicoot...

1713
01:48:52,460 --> 01:48:53,500
Carrotstick...

1714
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:54,800
There's also...

1715
01:48:56,460 --> 01:48:57,860
Buckminster Cogglesworth...

1716
01:48:58,700 --> 01:48:59,400
Blubber...

1717
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:01,700
Bubcalculus...

1718
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:04,000
It still exists.

1719
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:06,280
I can't believe it still exists.

1720
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:09,020
Oh, anyway.

1721
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:10,000
Anyway.

1722
01:49:10,540 --> 01:49:11,240
So...

1723
01:49:11,240 --> 01:49:12,160
They're like...

1724
01:49:12,160 --> 01:49:13,620
There were so many theories...

1725
01:49:13,620 --> 01:49:14,440
On like...

1726
01:49:14,440 --> 01:49:15,700
How did Sherlock...

1727
01:49:15,700 --> 01:49:16,200
You know...

1728
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:16,980
Fake his death...

1729
01:49:16,980 --> 01:49:17,900
In the modern era.

1730
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:19,180
And...

1731
01:49:19,180 --> 01:49:20,900
And there were a lot of like...

1732
01:49:20,900 --> 01:49:22,440
Very creative theories.

1733
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:24,040
And then...

1734
01:49:24,040 --> 01:49:25,640
What actually happens...

1735
01:49:26,120 --> 01:49:27,320
In this show...

1736
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:28,420
Is that...

1737
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:30,180
John...

1738
01:49:30,180 --> 01:49:31,400
Watson...

1739
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:32,200
Just gets...

1740
01:49:32,200 --> 01:49:32,640
Drugged.

1741
01:49:33,340 --> 01:49:36,300
They like...

1742
01:49:36,300 --> 01:49:37,780
Give him some like...

1743
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:38,680
Hallucigen.

1744
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:40,300
So like...

1745
01:49:40,300 --> 01:49:41,100
The whole thing is that...

1746
01:49:41,100 --> 01:49:42,720
Sherlock always jumps off somewhere.

1747
01:49:43,180 --> 01:49:44,180
So like...

1748
01:49:44,180 --> 01:49:44,960
I don't care.

1749
01:49:45,140 --> 01:49:45,440
It's...

1750
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:46,780
Season 3 was fucking terrible.

1751
01:49:46,860 --> 01:49:47,600
I'm gonna spoil it.

1752
01:49:50,460 --> 01:49:52,880
I didn't even watch season 3.

1753
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:53,680
I...

1754
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:55,340
I heard how bad it was.

1755
01:49:55,460 --> 01:49:56,880
That I didn't even watch season 3.

1756
01:49:57,020 --> 01:49:57,920
Because I was like...

1757
01:49:57,920 --> 01:49:59,160
That's so fucking dumb.

1758
01:49:59,900 --> 01:50:00,500
So...

1759
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:01,260
So...

1760
01:50:01,260 --> 01:50:02,760
John Watson...

1761
01:50:02,760 --> 01:50:04,840
Watches Sherlock jump off a building.

1762
01:50:05,420 --> 01:50:06,560
And he's like...

1763
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:07,600
Oh my god!

1764
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:08,760
But like...

1765
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:10,160
What actually happens...

1766
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:11,380
Is that...

1767
01:50:12,620 --> 01:50:13,220
Somebody...

1768
01:50:13,220 --> 01:50:13,960
Like...

1769
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:15,540
He bumps into someone...

1770
01:50:15,540 --> 01:50:16,380
And they just...

1771
01:50:16,380 --> 01:50:17,340
Drugged him up...

1772
01:50:17,340 --> 01:50:17,580
And gave him some like...

1773
01:50:17,580 --> 01:50:18,220
And gave him like...

1774
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:18,780
Hallucigens.

1775
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:19,680
So it's...

1776
01:50:19,680 --> 01:50:20,680
He thinks...

1777
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:22,400
He saw Sherlock...

1778
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:23,700
Jumps off a building.

1779
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:25,580
And then he...

1780
01:50:26,380 --> 01:50:27,400
And then Sherlock...

1781
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:28,080
And it was like...

1782
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:29,420
A stunt double or whatever.

1783
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:30,600
And like...

1784
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:31,740
Sherlock just walks away.

1785
01:50:32,340 --> 01:50:32,660
Like...

1786
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:38,860
It's just like...

1787
01:50:38,860 --> 01:50:39,080
Alright.

1788
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:43,220
And I was like...

1789
01:50:43,220 --> 01:50:43,500
What?

1790
01:50:48,640 --> 01:50:49,900
I think...

1791
01:50:50,580 --> 01:50:52,260
I think that was it, right?

1792
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,020
Wait, I remember that.

1793
01:50:55,420 --> 01:50:56,400
I think...

1794
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:57,880
It's been a while.

1795
01:50:58,160 --> 01:50:58,780
Is that...

1796
01:50:58,780 --> 01:51:00,480
Was that exactly how it went?

1797
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:02,600
Because I watched that scene...

1798
01:51:03,180 --> 01:51:03,700
Someone...

1799
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:05,680
Like they posted that scene...

1800
01:51:05,680 --> 01:51:06,800
There and then...

1801
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:07,060
Yeah.

1802
01:51:07,700 --> 01:51:09,500
Like someone was like...

1803
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:09,920
Yeah.

1804
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:11,620
It was just one...

1805
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:13,300
One short answer.

1806
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:14,940
Just a little...

1807
01:51:14,940 --> 01:51:15,380
Yeah.

1808
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:23,640
So...

1809
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:24,240
Um...

1810
01:51:24,240 --> 01:51:25,140
Yeah, so...

1811
01:51:25,140 --> 01:51:27,580
That was basically how they explained...

1812
01:51:27,580 --> 01:51:28,600
How Sherlock...

1813
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:29,640
Faked his death.

1814
01:51:29,720 --> 01:51:30,280
And I was like...

1815
01:51:30,280 --> 01:51:31,580
That's so fucking...

1816
01:51:31,580 --> 01:51:32,660
I was just like...

1817
01:51:32,660 --> 01:51:34,420
That's so dumb.

1818
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:36,700
That's so fucking dumb.

1819
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:38,920
But to be fair...

1820
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:41,000
The writers for that show...

1821
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,100
Don't know how to write past season 2.

1822
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:43,960
Like...

1823
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:44,400
Because...

1824
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:45,360
For those who don't know...

1825
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:47,560
The writers of the Sherlock show...

1826
01:51:49,580 --> 01:51:50,240
Um...

1827
01:51:50,240 --> 01:51:51,740
It is...

1828
01:51:51,740 --> 01:51:52,260
Uh...

1829
01:51:52,260 --> 01:51:53,880
Written by...

1830
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:54,820
Uh...

1831
01:51:54,820 --> 01:51:55,860
Mark Gatiss...

1832
01:51:55,860 --> 01:51:56,960
And Steven...

1833
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:57,360
Uh...

1834
01:51:57,360 --> 01:51:57,760
What's his name?

1835
01:51:57,820 --> 01:51:59,040
Steven Moffat?

1836
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:00,600
Moffat or something?

1837
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:01,820
And...

1838
01:52:01,820 --> 01:52:02,440
Uh...

1839
01:52:02,440 --> 01:52:04,800
They don't know how to write past...

1840
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:06,020
Uh...

1841
01:52:06,020 --> 01:52:08,460
They don't know how to write past a certain season...

1842
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:10,140
And it definitely shows.

1843
01:52:11,340 --> 01:52:12,000
Yeah.

1844
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:14,340
Everything...

1845
01:52:14,340 --> 01:52:17,100
Like it just all fell apart after season 2.

1846
01:52:17,560 --> 01:52:18,800
After Moriarty was gone.

1847
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:20,400
I mean, he was like the best part.

1848
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:22,880
Honestly, Moriarty was honestly the best.

1849
01:52:23,120 --> 01:52:23,460
Moriarty...

1850
01:52:23,460 --> 01:52:24,000
Like...

1851
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,820
The chemistry between Moriarty and like...

1852
01:52:26,820 --> 01:52:27,300
Uh...

1853
01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:28,300
Uh...

1854
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:29,480
Um...

1855
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:29,740
Alright.

1856
01:52:30,260 --> 01:52:31,240
Generator time.

1857
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:31,860
And it...

1858
01:52:34,760 --> 01:52:36,900
Between Moriarty and...

1859
01:52:36,900 --> 01:52:38,700
Billard Ball Cankersore...

1860
01:52:38,700 --> 01:52:39,500
Was like...

1861
01:52:39,500 --> 01:52:40,480
Really, really good.

1862
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:40,980
And like...

1863
01:52:40,980 --> 01:52:42,180
Because, you know, the...

1864
01:52:42,180 --> 01:52:44,640
The rivalry between them was really interesting.

1865
01:52:44,860 --> 01:52:45,200
And like...

1866
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:47,440
It's understandable that they had to kill him off because...

1867
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:48,960
It does happen in the actual book.

1868
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:50,520
But...

1869
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:52,040
The way they...

1870
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:54,760
They faked Sherlock's death was just too much.

1871
01:52:54,860 --> 01:52:56,060
Like, it was actually...

1872
01:52:56,060 --> 01:52:57,940
It was so fucking dumb.

1873
01:52:58,240 --> 01:52:59,780
Like, let's just drug up...

1874
01:52:59,780 --> 01:53:01,540
Let's just drug up...

1875
01:53:01,540 --> 01:53:02,740
John Watson.

1876
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:05,260
And then be like...

1877
01:53:05,260 --> 01:53:06,080
He's okay.

1878
01:53:06,440 --> 01:53:07,340
He's dead.

1879
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:12,220
That's how he...

1880
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,720
John, he's dead.

1881
01:53:15,640 --> 01:53:19,140
Let me put you on hallucinogens real quick.

1882
01:53:19,300 --> 01:53:20,580
But he's fucking dead.

1883
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:27,880
Alright, where was I?

1884
01:53:30,180 --> 01:53:31,760
Hanta, thank you for the super chat.

1885
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:33,020
Thank you, thank you.

1886
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:35,660
My pipelines of YouTubers was different.

1887
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:39,040
It was N64, PC, Yu-Gi-Oh, everyone around me dying.

1888
01:53:39,260 --> 01:53:41,820
YouTubers, thank you for the super chat.

1889
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:42,880
Thank you, thank you.

1890
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:44,520
Medi, thank you for the super chat.

1891
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:45,280
Thank you, thank you.

1892
01:53:46,740 --> 01:53:47,420
Surprisingly,

1893
01:53:51,340 --> 01:53:51,860
no.

1894
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:54,160
My...

1895
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:59,280
My origin story was...

1896
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:02,280
I told you guys before, but...

1897
01:54:02,280 --> 01:54:03,260
My...

1898
01:54:03,880 --> 01:54:04,880
Origin story...

1899
01:54:08,940 --> 01:54:09,620
Was...

1900
01:54:10,640 --> 01:54:11,500
L and Light.

1901
01:54:17,500 --> 01:54:21,380
I think that is, like, the origin story for a lot of fujo.

1902
01:54:23,380 --> 01:54:27,340
You see, L and Light were, like, my first...

1903
01:54:30,020 --> 01:54:30,980
They were...

1904
01:54:30,980 --> 01:54:32,220
Sorry, not L and Light.

1905
01:54:32,540 --> 01:54:34,220
They weren't my first, but, like...

1906
01:54:34,700 --> 01:54:36,380
They weren't my first fixation.

1907
01:54:36,380 --> 01:54:41,340
But Death Note was the very first anime that I've actually watched.

1908
01:54:42,280 --> 01:54:45,560
And that I was incredibly obsessed with.

1909
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:48,980
Like, I was one of those fans.

1910
01:54:49,100 --> 01:54:50,860
I was incredibly obsessed with Death Note.

1911
01:54:51,220 --> 01:54:52,620
And I had, like, every single...

1912
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:56,320
I had, like, all the collectibles and stuff.

1913
01:54:56,460 --> 01:55:02,280
And also, like, I kept up to date with, like, everything the author has done after Death Note.

1914
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:04,000
Except for the ones about angels.

1915
01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:04,900
Like, I'm sorry.

1916
01:55:07,820 --> 01:55:14,260
If you respect your fans, you would understand that no fan can read through that one.

1917
01:55:23,020 --> 01:55:28,260
If you respect your fans, like, you don't want your fan to go through that.

1918
01:55:28,260 --> 01:55:29,180
Like...

1919
01:55:31,480 --> 01:55:32,520
Okay, so...

1920
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:35,980
I didn't fully read Planet Men, but I did read the finale.

1921
01:55:37,780 --> 01:55:38,300
And...

1922
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:43,320
How they... Okay, so, the whole thing is about all these angels trying to, like...

1923
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:47,060
Trying to, like, kill each other.

1924
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,260
What was it?

1925
01:55:50,360 --> 01:55:52,100
Oh my gosh, I don't even remember.

1926
01:55:53,100 --> 01:55:55,840
It ends really... It's a really stupid end.

1927
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:58,980
Basically, the whole world just dies.

1928
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:01,100
Like, it just disappears because the...

1929
01:56:02,120 --> 01:56:03,020
What was it?

1930
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:03,840
Okay, one day...

1931
01:56:05,380 --> 01:56:06,020
Pondering...

1932
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:08,520
I don't even remember.

1933
01:56:08,780 --> 01:56:09,260
Oh yeah!

1934
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:12,060
There was a contest to become God.

1935
01:56:12,320 --> 01:56:15,160
So all the angels were killing each other...

1936
01:56:15,620 --> 01:56:18,180
To basically be the next God.

1937
01:56:20,280 --> 01:56:21,560
Anyway, so...

1938
01:56:21,560 --> 01:56:23,920
It ended with the God...

1939
01:56:26,740 --> 01:56:30,100
The God that won the contest...

1940
01:56:30,100 --> 01:56:32,280
Decided that... To end the world.

1941
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:34,360
End the entire universe and existence.

1942
01:56:34,980 --> 01:56:38,140
Because he was like, humans don't deserve this.

1943
01:56:38,380 --> 01:56:40,980
Like, and then he's like... And then he kills himself.

1944
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:45,580
And by killing himself, he ends the entire existence of the world.

1945
01:56:45,660 --> 01:56:46,180
Like, universe.

1946
01:56:46,700 --> 01:56:48,620
And that's how it ends.

1947
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:50,840
So I was just like, wait...

1948
01:56:52,060 --> 01:56:53,040
That's stupid.

1949
01:56:56,520 --> 01:56:56,980
That's...

1950
01:56:56,980 --> 01:56:58,780
Like, it was so pretentious.

1951
01:56:58,880 --> 01:56:59,840
Okay, so...

1952
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:00,860
You know how like...

1953
01:57:00,860 --> 01:57:03,040
Death Note, you can say Death Note was like...

1954
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:04,720
Incredibly pretentious.

1955
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:07,120
You can see... Not incredibly pretentious, but...

1956
01:57:07,120 --> 01:57:11,260
You can see it in some of the writing in Death Note that does get a little pretentious.

1957
01:57:11,440 --> 01:57:14,080
But it never like, breaks that mold...

1958
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:17,880
Of like, you know, maybe it's trying to be too smart for its own good.

1959
01:57:18,180 --> 01:57:20,840
But Platinum End was actually like...

1960
01:57:21,980 --> 01:57:25,140
They tried to introduce so many of these like, really...

1961
01:57:26,360 --> 01:57:30,160
Elaborate concepts and like, philosophy and everything.

1962
01:57:30,580 --> 01:57:31,840
But it was so...

1963
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:34,600
Yeah, like, Death Note is like, pretentious fun.

1964
01:57:35,120 --> 01:57:37,740
This one is like, they try to make you feel stupid.

1965
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:39,040
But...

1966
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:40,500
It doesn't make sense.

1967
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:41,840
Like, what they're trying to explain...

1968
01:57:42,660 --> 01:57:44,900
Just doesn't make any sense.

1969
01:57:44,980 --> 01:57:46,760
They're like, making shit up as they go along.

1970
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:47,840
So...

1971
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:49,860
It was like...

1972
01:57:53,140 --> 01:57:53,620
So...

1973
01:57:53,620 --> 01:57:57,380
Like, they're trying to like, question the meaning of life and all that shit.

1974
01:57:57,640 --> 01:58:00,520
And like, what it means to exist and everything.

1975
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:02,620
And then I'm like...

1976
01:58:04,260 --> 01:58:06,260
It wasn't that much...

1977
01:58:06,260 --> 01:58:09,280
They tried to make the writing smart.

1978
01:58:09,860 --> 01:58:11,120
But like...

1979
01:58:11,120 --> 01:58:13,380
They were just confusing the readers.

1980
01:58:13,640 --> 01:58:14,400
And it was too...

1981
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:15,640
Like, it's not that deep.

1982
01:58:16,860 --> 01:58:17,380
Like...

1983
01:58:20,100 --> 01:58:20,620
It's...

1984
01:58:23,080 --> 01:58:23,960
Yeah, so...

1985
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:26,000
Yeah,

1986
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:30,620
that's basically...

1987
01:58:30,620 --> 01:58:31,380
That's how it ends.

1988
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:32,140
And then...

1989
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:34,020
It just feels like...

1990
01:58:34,020 --> 01:58:35,120
What was the point of reading this?

1991
01:58:35,420 --> 01:58:36,100
Which I didn't.

1992
01:58:36,220 --> 01:58:36,820
Which I didn't.

1993
01:58:36,900 --> 01:58:39,080
I read like, the first couple of chapters.

1994
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:40,160
And then I was like...

1995
01:58:40,160 --> 01:58:41,700
And then I heard it ended.

1996
01:58:42,120 --> 01:58:43,640
So then, I read the ending.

1997
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:44,280
And I was like...

1998
01:58:44,280 --> 01:58:44,840
Oh, okay.

1999
01:58:45,100 --> 01:58:46,220
That's how it ends?

2000
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:46,920
Like...

2001
01:58:46,920 --> 01:58:49,920
Like, everybody else was super happy.

2002
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:51,780
Like, it's so weird, too.

2003
01:58:51,900 --> 01:58:53,920
Because in the chapter at the end...

2004
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:56,300
No, the thing is...

2005
01:58:56,300 --> 01:58:57,060
The author writes...

2006
01:58:57,620 --> 01:58:59,520
Like, Bakuman was so good.

2007
01:58:59,580 --> 01:59:00,640
I really like Bakuman.

2008
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:04,280
And I really like their newest comedy manga.

2009
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:07,460
Where they tackle comedy and stuff.

2010
01:59:07,580 --> 01:59:10,280
And how the straight man and the funny man...

2011
01:59:10,280 --> 01:59:11,220
Like, they did that.

2012
01:59:11,740 --> 01:59:14,800
And those two were really good and very educational, too.

2013
01:59:15,260 --> 01:59:15,780
And...

2014
01:59:15,780 --> 01:59:16,580
Oh my god.

2015
01:59:16,640 --> 01:59:17,980
Planetman was just...

2016
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:19,880
I just...

2017
01:59:19,880 --> 01:59:21,040
I don't know, like...

2018
01:59:23,940 --> 01:59:25,140
Yeah, like...

2019
01:59:25,140 --> 01:59:26,360
Like, it was so weird.

2020
01:59:27,400 --> 01:59:28,000
Because...

2021
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:28,980
In the last chapter...

2022
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:30,920
Everybody...

2023
01:59:30,920 --> 01:59:33,160
All the other characters were happy.

2024
01:59:33,420 --> 01:59:34,820
And they were living life.

2025
01:59:35,100 --> 01:59:36,460
And, like, enjoying life.

2026
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:39,940
And then the fucking god was like...

2027
01:59:39,940 --> 01:59:41,380
No, life sucks.

2028
01:59:41,980 --> 01:59:42,340
War.

2029
01:59:42,900 --> 01:59:43,360
War.

2030
01:59:43,580 --> 01:59:45,260
Depressed people are depressed.

2031
01:59:45,880 --> 01:59:46,280
Batman.

2032
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:48,940
Famine.

2033
01:59:49,660 --> 01:59:50,200
Poverty.

2034
01:59:50,900 --> 01:59:52,780
Society doesn't deserve this.

2035
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:54,700
And then he just ends himself.

2036
01:59:54,980 --> 01:59:56,160
But then, like...

2037
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:58,920
They put that on you on the last part.

2038
01:59:59,380 --> 02:00:01,840
While, like, in the beginning of the last chapter...

2039
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:04,180
The beginning of the last chapter, everyone was just happy.

2040
02:00:04,360 --> 02:00:05,740
Like, everyone was like...

2041
02:00:05,740 --> 02:00:06,420
Yippee!

2042
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:08,500
I have a family now.

2043
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:10,860
After this whole, like...

2044
02:00:10,860 --> 02:00:13,080
Battle to the death with all these angels.

2045
02:00:14,280 --> 02:00:16,780
I have a family now.

2046
02:00:18,220 --> 02:00:18,740
I...

2047
02:00:18,740 --> 02:00:20,660
Look at all my friends.

2048
02:00:20,860 --> 02:00:22,780
Oh my god, remember this character?

2049
02:00:23,160 --> 02:00:25,100
She's having a great time.

2050
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:27,280
Knowing how to live her life.

2051
02:00:27,500 --> 02:00:28,900
And then they were like...

2052
02:00:28,900 --> 02:00:30,680
And then they cut to the emo kid.

2053
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:31,560
He's like, no!

2054
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:33,180
Life is terrible.

2055
02:00:33,560 --> 02:00:37,700
Look at all these children dying from starvation and famine.

2056
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:39,240
And I'm like, what?

2057
02:00:44,160 --> 02:00:45,600
I'm just like...

2058
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:47,360
Like...

2059
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:51,560
It was such a huge whiplash.

2060
02:00:51,700 --> 02:00:52,800
I was just like...

2061
02:00:55,440 --> 02:00:56,480
But yeah, no.

2062
02:00:56,680 --> 02:00:57,780
Don't read Planet of Men.

2063
02:00:58,120 --> 02:00:59,740
I highly...

2064
02:00:59,740 --> 02:01:02,940
Just read anything else by any of the other authors.

2065
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:07,000
Like, just read anything else.

2066
02:01:08,780 --> 02:01:10,900
There's so many other things you can read.

2067
02:01:10,900 --> 02:01:12,760
Like the Shouha Shoten.

2068
02:01:13,380 --> 02:01:17,280
Shouha Shoten was not written by the Death Note writer.

2069
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:20,200
It was written by someone else.

2070
02:01:20,300 --> 02:01:22,200
But it was drawn by the Death Note illustrator.

2071
02:01:22,680 --> 02:01:27,420
So, I do recommend Shouha Shoten and Bakuman if you like Death Note.

2072
02:01:28,200 --> 02:01:30,420
I don't know what else did they do.

2073
02:01:32,220 --> 02:01:33,920
I think that's like...

2074
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:35,700
He's only written like...

2075
02:01:35,700 --> 02:01:37,660
What's Skip Yamada-kun?

2076
02:01:37,780 --> 02:01:38,780
I don't know that one.

2077
02:01:39,140 --> 02:01:40,320
Oh, this one's a one-shot.

2078
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:45,460
So, I highly recommend those two.

2079
02:01:45,500 --> 02:01:48,460
I can't wait for them to do another spin-off of Death Note.

2080
02:01:49,680 --> 02:01:53,540
They always update us with one-shots and be like...

2081
02:01:53,540 --> 02:01:55,380
So, what's going on in the Death Note universe?

2082
02:01:55,620 --> 02:01:57,000
Every couple of years.

2083
02:01:57,320 --> 02:01:58,840
So, I hope they do another one.

2084
02:02:00,860 --> 02:02:05,100
Okay, what's crazy was that...

2085
02:02:05,100 --> 02:02:08,100
Yeah, so...

2086
02:02:09,260 --> 02:02:11,360
I'm not here to be political, but like...

2087
02:02:12,420 --> 02:02:16,540
I'm just saying that in one of the one-shots...

2088
02:02:16,540 --> 02:02:20,180
They actually gave the Death Note to Donald Trump.

2089
02:02:28,570 --> 02:02:30,190
I was just like...

2090
02:02:32,090 --> 02:02:33,570
Why is he here?

2091
02:02:35,050 --> 02:02:36,710
Why is he...

2092
02:02:37,730 --> 02:02:39,010
Why is he here?

2093
02:02:39,110 --> 02:02:40,650
I'm not making this up.

2094
02:02:40,650 --> 02:02:41,670
You can literally...

2095
02:02:41,670 --> 02:02:43,510
I remember reading that...

2096
02:02:43,510 --> 02:02:45,250
The moment it dropped.

2097
02:02:45,530 --> 02:02:48,650
I remember reading it on day one.

2098
02:02:49,810 --> 02:02:56,380
I was like...

2099
02:02:56,380 --> 02:03:05,160
I was not expecting that.

2100
02:03:09,170 --> 02:03:11,260
Imagine being me.

2101
02:03:11,260 --> 02:03:12,380
Little me.

2102
02:03:12,680 --> 02:03:14,260
Being really excited...

2103
02:03:15,020 --> 02:03:17,760
About reading the newest one-shot.

2104
02:03:18,340 --> 02:03:20,660
I was just like...

2105
02:03:20,660 --> 02:03:20,960
What?

2106
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:22,700
Why is he here?

2107
02:03:27,940 --> 02:03:29,840
Why is he here?

2108
02:03:39,330 --> 02:03:41,570
But yes, anyway...

2109
02:03:46,230 --> 02:03:47,770
Coyote, thank you for the super chat.

2110
02:03:47,850 --> 02:03:48,810
Thank you, thank you.

2111
02:03:49,050 --> 02:03:51,410
Neopets created another furry yet again.

2112
02:03:51,750 --> 02:03:52,710
Thank you for the super chat.

2113
02:03:52,810 --> 02:03:53,210
Thank you, thank you.

2114
02:03:53,230 --> 02:03:55,280
Yeah, they could've just drawn any American president.

2115
02:04:02,050 --> 02:04:03,410
Oh my god.

2116
02:04:10,250 --> 02:04:12,210
Papa Smurf, thank you for the super chat.

2117
02:04:12,390 --> 02:04:13,490
Thank you, thank you.

2118
02:04:14,350 --> 02:04:17,190
My mom's credit card funds your super chat, so...

2119
02:04:17,190 --> 02:04:18,050
Thank you for the super chat.

2120
02:04:18,130 --> 02:04:19,090
Thank you, thank you.

2121
02:04:19,170 --> 02:04:20,190
Dr. Cranberry.

2122
02:04:20,610 --> 02:04:22,310
Yes, but you're not 10, Papa Smurf.

2123
02:04:22,330 --> 02:04:22,790
You're okay.

2124
02:04:26,350 --> 02:04:27,110
Dr. Cranberry.

2125
02:04:28,170 --> 02:04:29,070
Thank you for the super chat.

2126
02:04:29,150 --> 02:04:29,790
Thank you, thank you.

2127
02:04:29,830 --> 02:04:30,750
Doki telling you you're 95.

2128
02:04:31,030 --> 02:04:32,300
Oh yeah, I remember reading this.

2129
02:04:36,170 --> 02:04:38,570
I'm trying to remember which one I read and which one I haven't.

2130
02:04:38,590 --> 02:04:40,290
This is like my problem these days.

2131
02:04:41,470 --> 02:04:43,070
Sometimes I just don't remember.

2132
02:04:46,330 --> 02:04:46,890
Next scene.

2133
02:04:47,030 --> 02:04:47,770
Thank you for the super chat.

2134
02:04:47,850 --> 02:04:48,530
Thank you, thank you.

2135
02:04:48,710 --> 02:04:51,130
Back in my day, children just lied about their age...

2136
02:04:51,130 --> 02:04:53,310
Instead of complaining about being minors everywhere.

2137
02:04:53,470 --> 02:04:55,010
Thank you for the super chat.

2138
02:04:55,150 --> 02:04:56,150
Thank you, thank you.

2139
02:04:56,330 --> 02:04:56,730
Okay.

2140
02:04:57,830 --> 02:04:59,510
This might be like...

2141
02:05:00,130 --> 02:05:02,130
This might be like...

2142
02:05:02,130 --> 02:05:03,290
Oh, what's the word called?

2143
02:05:03,390 --> 02:05:04,970
Where like...

2144
02:05:04,970 --> 02:05:07,190
Your thought might not be like agreed by...

2145
02:05:08,310 --> 02:05:09,410
By the majority.

2146
02:05:10,350 --> 02:05:11,650
Oh, what's that word called?

2147
02:05:11,790 --> 02:05:12,350
My hot take.

2148
02:05:12,410 --> 02:05:13,850
Yeah, this might be my hot take.

2149
02:05:13,850 --> 02:05:14,930
But like...

2150
02:05:15,630 --> 02:05:19,850
When minors complain about how like...

2151
02:05:21,930 --> 02:05:25,610
An 18 plus space does not cater to them.

2152
02:05:26,010 --> 02:05:27,470
And they complain about it.

2153
02:05:28,050 --> 02:05:29,350
And I'm just like...

2154
02:05:29,350 --> 02:05:29,590
Why?

2155
02:05:29,830 --> 02:05:31,190
Why are you here?

2156
02:05:34,790 --> 02:05:36,150
And like...

2157
02:05:36,150 --> 02:05:39,210
How a lot of minors nowadays...

2158
02:05:39,210 --> 02:05:40,190
Are like...

2159
02:05:40,190 --> 02:05:44,890
Everything has to be catered towards people who are underage.

2160
02:05:44,890 --> 02:05:46,030
And I'm like...

2161
02:05:46,790 --> 02:05:47,130
No.

2162
02:05:47,630 --> 02:05:49,930
That's what adult spaces are for.

2163
02:05:51,630 --> 02:05:52,350
Like...

2164
02:05:53,090 --> 02:05:53,810
Like...

2165
02:05:53,810 --> 02:05:57,410
A lot of them are now incredibly entitled.

2166
02:05:58,010 --> 02:05:58,890
So like...

2167
02:06:00,710 --> 02:06:02,290
What am I...

2168
02:06:02,290 --> 02:06:02,610
Okay.

2169
02:06:03,230 --> 02:06:05,230
This might get a little like controversial.

2170
02:06:05,930 --> 02:06:07,190
But like...

2171
02:06:07,190 --> 02:06:09,570
So there's like Friday Night Funkin'.

2172
02:06:09,570 --> 02:06:13,430
I saw like the quote drama behind it.

2173
02:06:14,470 --> 02:06:15,410
So...

2174
02:06:15,410 --> 02:06:19,470
Friday Night Funkin' just released their newest update.

2175
02:06:19,850 --> 02:06:21,050
Their newest Pico update.

2176
02:06:22,030 --> 02:06:22,500
And...

2177
02:06:22,970 --> 02:06:25,830
For those who don't know what Pico is...

2178
02:06:25,830 --> 02:06:26,430
Pico...

2179
02:06:27,030 --> 02:06:29,430
Back then, during Newgrounds era...

2180
02:06:32,110 --> 02:06:32,580
During...

2181
02:06:33,050 --> 02:06:34,720
Newgrounds era...

2182
02:06:35,090 --> 02:06:36,430
Was based off...

2183
02:06:37,610 --> 02:06:38,690
School shooting.

2184
02:06:40,170 --> 02:06:40,640
So...

2185
02:06:41,110 --> 02:06:42,210
But like...

2186
02:06:42,210 --> 02:06:44,570
Back then, in Newgrounds era...

2187
02:06:44,810 --> 02:06:45,570
It was like...

2188
02:06:45,750 --> 02:06:47,730
It was all about being edgy.

2189
02:06:47,990 --> 02:06:50,210
So that's who Pico is.

2190
02:06:50,570 --> 02:06:51,090
Like...

2191
02:06:51,090 --> 02:06:51,870
Like...

2192
02:06:51,870 --> 02:06:55,450
We all know where Pico's origin story is.

2193
02:06:55,650 --> 02:06:58,210
And Friday Night Funkin' is not...

2194
02:06:58,750 --> 02:06:59,510
Like...

2195
02:06:59,510 --> 02:07:01,310
Does not like hide that.

2196
02:07:03,190 --> 02:07:04,030
Like...

2197
02:07:05,070 --> 02:07:05,490
And...

2198
02:07:10,510 --> 02:07:12,190
But Newgrounds...

2199
02:07:12,190 --> 02:07:13,090
Was like...

2200
02:07:13,090 --> 02:07:14,690
Super edgy.

2201
02:07:14,870 --> 02:07:15,450
So no.

2202
02:07:15,810 --> 02:07:18,190
They got mad because...

2203
02:07:19,630 --> 02:07:22,890
Yeah, they talked about...

2204
02:07:22,890 --> 02:07:23,790
Cause like...

2205
02:07:23,790 --> 02:07:25,950
You know, they were talking about the Pico origin.

2206
02:07:26,070 --> 02:07:27,190
So a lot of like...

2207
02:07:28,590 --> 02:07:31,530
Minors got really mad...

2208
02:07:31,530 --> 02:07:32,410
About...

2209
02:07:32,410 --> 02:07:33,290
Like some...

2210
02:07:33,290 --> 02:07:35,350
The stuff in the newest Pico update.

2211
02:07:35,890 --> 02:07:36,530
But...

2212
02:07:36,530 --> 02:07:39,090
Some of the more edgier things...

2213
02:07:39,090 --> 02:07:40,690
They were saying...

2214
02:07:40,690 --> 02:07:41,690
Was apparently...

2215
02:07:42,630 --> 02:07:44,770
In a censored version.

2216
02:07:44,910 --> 02:07:47,530
Like in the non-censored version of the game.

2217
02:07:47,710 --> 02:07:49,750
So you don't see that...

2218
02:07:50,250 --> 02:07:51,870
If you turn...

2219
02:07:51,870 --> 02:07:53,690
If you don't see the stuff they say...

2220
02:07:54,310 --> 02:07:56,830
If you turn on the censors.

2221
02:07:58,430 --> 02:07:58,910
Like...

2222
02:08:00,310 --> 02:08:01,630
Cause I was like...

2223
02:08:01,630 --> 02:08:02,610
Oh yeah, that's like...

2224
02:08:02,610 --> 02:08:04,110
These dialogues are pretty edgy.

2225
02:08:04,170 --> 02:08:05,550
I was like reading it...

2226
02:08:05,550 --> 02:08:07,610
And like listening to the dialogue...

2227
02:08:07,610 --> 02:08:08,690
And I was like...

2228
02:08:08,690 --> 02:08:09,890
Oh yeah, some of these dialogues...

2229
02:08:10,390 --> 02:08:11,730
Are incredibly edgy.

2230
02:08:12,010 --> 02:08:12,810
But like...

2231
02:08:12,810 --> 02:08:14,070
If you know the characters...

2232
02:08:14,070 --> 02:08:15,330
It was based off of...

2233
02:08:15,330 --> 02:08:15,910
In Newgrounds.

2234
02:08:15,930 --> 02:08:16,830
Cause I grew up in Newgrounds.

2235
02:08:16,850 --> 02:08:18,450
Oh, I forgot to add Newgrounds by the way.

2236
02:08:18,990 --> 02:08:19,430
Um...

2237
02:08:19,970 --> 02:08:20,410
Deviantart...

2238
02:08:21,370 --> 02:08:21,810
Newgrounds...

2239
02:08:22,470 --> 02:08:22,910
Tumblr...

2240
02:08:22,910 --> 02:08:23,370
I forgot.

2241
02:08:23,590 --> 02:08:23,950
There was...

2242
02:08:23,950 --> 02:08:25,890
I was also in Newgrounds.

2243
02:08:25,910 --> 02:08:26,590
So I was like...

2244
02:08:26,590 --> 02:08:27,870
I watched a lot of like...

2245
02:08:27,870 --> 02:08:29,950
The Newgrounds animations and stuff like that.

2246
02:08:30,190 --> 02:08:30,630
So...

2247
02:08:30,630 --> 02:08:31,050
Um...

2248
02:08:31,050 --> 02:08:32,970
I was also like an edgy kid too.

2249
02:08:33,490 --> 02:08:33,930
Um...

2250
02:08:34,410 --> 02:08:34,850
So...

2251
02:08:36,070 --> 02:08:36,950
So like...

2252
02:08:36,950 --> 02:08:37,710
Uh...

2253
02:08:37,710 --> 02:08:38,850
So like...

2254
02:08:39,410 --> 02:08:41,710
They were complaining about some of the dialogue...

2255
02:08:42,270 --> 02:08:45,110
That was in the uncensored version.

2256
02:08:46,170 --> 02:08:46,810
Uh...

2257
02:08:46,810 --> 02:08:47,610
Hahaha.

2258
02:08:48,110 --> 02:08:51,250
In the uncensored version of the Pico update.

2259
02:08:51,610 --> 02:08:52,930
And then I was like...

2260
02:08:53,450 --> 02:08:54,090
Oh yeah, I know.

2261
02:08:54,130 --> 02:08:55,810
I can get why people are like...

2262
02:08:55,810 --> 02:08:56,170
Woah.

2263
02:08:56,550 --> 02:08:57,910
But then...

2264
02:08:57,910 --> 02:08:58,410
In New...

2265
02:08:58,410 --> 02:08:59,770
Back then in Newgrounds...

2266
02:08:59,770 --> 02:09:01,050
That was the thing.

2267
02:09:01,590 --> 02:09:01,910
Like...

2268
02:09:02,390 --> 02:09:03,390
Like the...

2269
02:09:03,390 --> 02:09:04,470
They were trying to...

2270
02:09:04,470 --> 02:09:06,450
Those were the characters back then.

2271
02:09:06,850 --> 02:09:07,490
And...

2272
02:09:08,370 --> 02:09:08,870
Like...

2273
02:09:08,870 --> 02:09:09,650
Tankman...

2274
02:09:09,650 --> 02:09:10,150
What...

2275
02:09:10,150 --> 02:09:11,130
Said all that shit.

2276
02:09:11,290 --> 02:09:11,650
Like...

2277
02:09:11,650 --> 02:09:12,210
Back in the...

2278
02:09:12,210 --> 02:09:12,990
I watched the tank...

2279
02:09:12,990 --> 02:09:14,710
I remember watching the Tankman animations.

2280
02:09:15,330 --> 02:09:16,190
And I was like...

2281
02:09:16,190 --> 02:09:18,450
That's literally what he says in the animations.

2282
02:09:18,630 --> 02:09:18,930
Like...

2283
02:09:18,930 --> 02:09:19,330
You can't...

2284
02:09:19,330 --> 02:09:19,930
They can't...

2285
02:09:19,930 --> 02:09:20,490
They didn't want to...

2286
02:09:20,490 --> 02:09:21,590
They can't just rewrite them.

2287
02:09:22,030 --> 02:09:22,530
Like...

2288
02:09:22,530 --> 02:09:22,790
Hahaha.

2289
02:09:24,070 --> 02:09:26,010
It is a product of it's time.

2290
02:09:26,330 --> 02:09:27,930
But you have to remember...

2291
02:09:27,930 --> 02:09:30,590
Tankman said all of that shit back then.

2292
02:09:30,950 --> 02:09:31,450
Hahaha.

2293
02:09:34,890 --> 02:09:35,890
He said...

2294
02:09:35,890 --> 02:09:37,870
A lot of fucked up shit...

2295
02:09:37,870 --> 02:09:38,950
In those animations.

2296
02:09:40,210 --> 02:09:40,710
Hahaha.

2297
02:09:42,470 --> 02:09:44,630
And they did put it...

2298
02:09:44,630 --> 02:09:46,990
In the uncensored version.

2299
02:09:48,670 --> 02:09:49,270
Hahaha.

2300
02:09:51,750 --> 02:09:52,350
Um...

2301
02:09:52,350 --> 02:09:53,790
It was a different time.

2302
02:09:53,930 --> 02:09:54,510
But like...

2303
02:09:54,510 --> 02:09:57,230
I saw like a lot of minors...

2304
02:09:57,230 --> 02:09:58,770
Were not happy about it.

2305
02:09:58,950 --> 02:10:00,310
And I was just like...

2306
02:10:00,310 --> 02:10:02,410
Isn't Friday Night Funkin'...

2307
02:10:03,130 --> 02:10:03,730
Like...

2308
02:10:03,730 --> 02:10:04,910
You know...

2309
02:10:04,910 --> 02:10:06,930
The title is basically like...

2310
02:10:06,930 --> 02:10:07,690
Friday Night Fucking.

2311
02:10:16,750 --> 02:10:17,470
Like...

2312
02:10:17,470 --> 02:10:18,530
That's...

2313
02:10:18,530 --> 02:10:19,070
Yeah.

2314
02:10:19,290 --> 02:10:20,250
It's just like...

2315
02:10:20,250 --> 02:10:21,290
I think...

2316
02:10:21,850 --> 02:10:22,210
Originally...

2317
02:10:22,210 --> 02:10:23,390
It was not for kids.

2318
02:10:23,690 --> 02:10:26,150
I'm pretty sure the creators originally created it...

2319
02:10:26,150 --> 02:10:27,710
Not geared towards children.

2320
02:10:28,130 --> 02:10:28,910
It just...

2321
02:10:29,610 --> 02:10:30,050
Um...

2322
02:10:30,050 --> 02:10:30,890
It just led...

2323
02:10:30,890 --> 02:10:31,810
Led to it.

2324
02:10:32,230 --> 02:10:32,730
Hahaha.

2325
02:10:32,810 --> 02:10:33,650
That's like...

2326
02:10:33,650 --> 02:10:34,610
Yeah.

2327
02:10:35,510 --> 02:10:37,570
The kid's all about...

2328
02:10:37,570 --> 02:10:38,430
Being subtle.

2329
02:10:38,990 --> 02:10:39,230
Hahaha.

2330
02:10:41,430 --> 02:10:42,190
Uh... Yeah.

2331
02:10:42,270 --> 02:10:43,210
And you literally...

2332
02:10:43,210 --> 02:10:43,870
Literally...

2333
02:10:43,870 --> 02:10:45,110
The death scene is...

2334
02:10:45,110 --> 02:10:46,030
Getting blue balled.

2335
02:10:46,350 --> 02:10:47,870
You literally get blue balled.

2336
02:10:47,930 --> 02:10:48,950
I don't know how...

2337
02:10:48,950 --> 02:10:50,250
They couldn't comprehend that.

2338
02:10:57,310 --> 02:10:57,910
Apparently...

2339
02:10:57,910 --> 02:10:59,390
If you do a hundred...

2340
02:10:59,390 --> 02:11:01,290
They added a new thing...

2341
02:11:01,290 --> 02:11:02,550
Where if you get...

2342
02:11:02,550 --> 02:11:03,850
A hundred percent...

2343
02:11:04,550 --> 02:11:05,030
Um...

2344
02:11:05,030 --> 02:11:06,870
At a level...

2345
02:11:06,870 --> 02:11:07,550
Um...

2346
02:11:08,390 --> 02:11:10,870
He throws girlfriend into the bed...

2347
02:11:10,870 --> 02:11:12,170
And they start getting freaky.

2348
02:11:12,810 --> 02:11:12,890
Hahaha.

2349
02:11:13,370 --> 02:11:14,150
They start...

2350
02:11:14,150 --> 02:11:16,030
They start Sims woohooing.

2351
02:11:16,350 --> 02:11:17,090
Um...

2352
02:11:17,090 --> 02:11:19,450
If you get a hundred percent...

2353
02:11:19,450 --> 02:11:20,970
It literally plays...

2354
02:11:20,970 --> 02:11:23,230
The Sims woohoo animation.

2355
02:11:23,750 --> 02:11:24,290
Hahaha.

2356
02:11:26,050 --> 02:11:26,490
Hahaha.

2357
02:11:29,750 --> 02:11:30,590
Um...

2358
02:11:30,590 --> 02:11:31,550
So yeah.

2359
02:11:31,550 --> 02:11:32,290
No, that's...

2360
02:11:32,290 --> 02:11:33,090
That's why I'm like...

2361
02:11:33,090 --> 02:11:34,430
Kids like...

2362
02:11:34,430 --> 02:11:35,250
Like, I don't know.

2363
02:11:35,310 --> 02:11:36,430
I just feel like...

2364
02:11:36,430 --> 02:11:38,630
You don't need to understand the space you're in.

2365
02:11:38,690 --> 02:11:39,450
Cause like...

2366
02:11:39,450 --> 02:11:40,930
When things are made for adults...

2367
02:11:41,270 --> 02:11:42,590
They cannot be...

2368
02:11:42,590 --> 02:11:43,510
You know...

2369
02:11:43,510 --> 02:11:45,630
Like, you have to...

2370
02:11:45,630 --> 02:11:47,350
Be aware...

2371
02:11:47,350 --> 02:11:48,490
That like...

2372
02:11:48,490 --> 02:11:49,450
Uh...

2373
02:11:49,450 --> 02:11:52,110
The space was originally not made for you.

2374
02:11:52,650 --> 02:11:53,550
And like...

2375
02:11:53,550 --> 02:11:53,890
They...

2376
02:11:53,890 --> 02:11:56,390
They can't fully cater to you.

2377
02:11:57,230 --> 02:11:59,650
And complaining won't solve anything.

2378
02:11:59,650 --> 02:12:00,190
Hahaha.

2379
02:12:02,850 --> 02:12:03,290
Uh...

2380
02:12:03,290 --> 02:12:03,850
Let's see.

2381
02:12:08,850 --> 02:12:09,290
Uh...

2382
02:12:09,990 --> 02:12:11,250
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

2383
02:12:11,330 --> 02:12:12,110
Thank you, thank you.

2384
02:12:12,170 --> 02:12:15,370
You're legally obligated to play Hollow Knight before Silksong releases.

2385
02:12:15,510 --> 02:12:16,610
Yeah, I actually really want...

2386
02:12:16,610 --> 02:12:16,950
Um...

2387
02:12:16,950 --> 02:12:17,530
If...

2388
02:12:17,530 --> 02:12:19,890
When I find out when Silksong releases...

2389
02:12:19,890 --> 02:12:21,550
I'll schedule a Hollow Knight playthrough.

2390
02:12:21,790 --> 02:12:23,790
Cause I do want to try to check out Silksong too.

2391
02:12:24,130 --> 02:12:24,570
But...

2392
02:12:24,570 --> 02:12:25,270
Um...

2393
02:12:25,270 --> 02:12:25,950
I want to...

2394
02:12:25,950 --> 02:12:28,730
Like I said, I want to be able to complete Hollow Knight before I do.

2395
02:12:28,730 --> 02:12:29,450
Uh...

2396
02:12:29,450 --> 02:12:30,770
I want to do Silksong on launch day.

2397
02:12:31,250 --> 02:12:31,690
Um...

2398
02:12:31,690 --> 02:12:32,690
Like the hun...

2399
02:12:32,690 --> 02:12:35,130
Thousands of other streamers are gonna do that too.

2400
02:12:35,550 --> 02:12:35,830
Uh...

2401
02:12:35,830 --> 02:12:37,590
MrBrokenBlood, thank you for the super chat.

2402
02:12:37,650 --> 02:12:38,410
Thank you, thank you.

2403
02:12:38,510 --> 02:12:40,470
Moo, call me a cow and milk away.

2404
02:12:40,610 --> 02:12:42,730
Anything for Silksong.

2405
02:12:43,490 --> 02:12:44,810
Thank you for the super chat.

2406
02:12:44,910 --> 02:12:45,670
Thank you, thank you.

2407
02:12:46,350 --> 02:12:46,790
Um...

2408
02:12:46,790 --> 02:12:47,270
Play...

2409
02:12:47,270 --> 02:12:48,250
Finish the story mode.

2410
02:12:48,610 --> 02:12:51,050
There's no way I can do 100% on Hollow Knight.

2411
02:12:51,130 --> 02:12:52,770
I heard it's like a really...

2412
02:12:52,770 --> 02:12:54,250
Really long game.

2413
02:12:54,390 --> 02:12:54,830
But...

2414
02:12:54,830 --> 02:12:55,510
Um...

2415
02:12:55,510 --> 02:12:56,430
Just do the...

2416
02:12:56,430 --> 02:12:57,910
Finishing the story mode and stuff.

2417
02:12:59,750 --> 02:13:00,190
Um...

2418
02:13:00,190 --> 02:13:00,570
Oh yeah!

2419
02:13:01,410 --> 02:13:02,730
I know it's a little bit too...

2420
02:13:03,470 --> 02:13:04,830
I know it's early to say, but...

2421
02:13:05,610 --> 02:13:06,050
Uh...

2422
02:13:06,050 --> 02:13:07,070
Next week...

2423
02:13:07,070 --> 02:13:07,910
Um...

2424
02:13:07,910 --> 02:13:08,990
I think you guys might have noticed.

2425
02:13:09,130 --> 02:13:12,910
I'm like slowly getting through some of the charity goals and stuff from last year.

2426
02:13:13,290 --> 02:13:13,690
Um...

2427
02:13:13,690 --> 02:13:15,390
Now that my schedule is a lot more free.

2428
02:13:15,630 --> 02:13:17,710
And I'm less stressed out about everything else.

2429
02:13:17,770 --> 02:13:19,230
I'm still stressed out about taxes now.

2430
02:13:19,630 --> 02:13:20,070
But...

2431
02:13:20,070 --> 02:13:21,570
Cause now I realize I have to pay...

2432
02:13:21,570 --> 02:13:23,390
Actually pay more than what I just paid.

2433
02:13:23,710 --> 02:13:23,970
Uh...

2434
02:13:23,970 --> 02:13:26,250
There are more taxes that I haven't paid yet.

2435
02:13:26,510 --> 02:13:27,250
Cause I thought I did.

2436
02:13:27,250 --> 02:13:28,010
And I was like...

2437
02:13:28,010 --> 02:13:28,070
Yeah!

2438
02:13:28,150 --> 02:13:28,750
I finished it!

2439
02:13:28,990 --> 02:13:30,170
And I finished it, but like...

2440
02:13:30,170 --> 02:13:31,150
I don't have to worry about paying more.

2441
02:13:31,250 --> 02:13:32,370
But apparently I still have to pay more.

2442
02:13:32,450 --> 02:13:32,990
So I'm a little bit...

2443
02:13:32,990 --> 02:13:34,050
I'm like incredibly stressed out.

2444
02:13:34,290 --> 02:13:34,510
Anyway!

2445
02:13:34,770 --> 02:13:35,850
Next week...

2446
02:13:35,850 --> 02:13:36,330
Um...

2447
02:13:36,330 --> 02:13:38,190
I will be doing Visage next week.

2448
02:13:38,230 --> 02:13:39,870
And I'll be drinking for Visage next week.

2449
02:13:40,510 --> 02:13:40,910
And...

2450
02:13:40,910 --> 02:13:45,010
I dragged Mint along to be in call with me while playing it.

2451
02:13:45,590 --> 02:13:45,990
So...

2452
02:13:45,990 --> 02:13:47,730
I believe that...

2453
02:13:47,730 --> 02:13:49,810
Would be on Friday next week?

2454
02:13:49,830 --> 02:13:51,210
I don't remember what time I...

2455
02:13:51,210 --> 02:13:52,530
I was the one that set it up.

2456
02:13:52,530 --> 02:13:52,730
So...

2457
02:13:54,770 --> 02:13:55,250
Oh!

2458
02:13:55,390 --> 02:13:56,210
It'll be on Friday.

2459
02:13:56,230 --> 02:13:57,010
It'll be on Friday.

2460
02:13:57,150 --> 02:13:57,670
Next week.

2461
02:13:57,830 --> 02:13:58,270
Next week.

2462
02:13:58,370 --> 02:13:58,710
Next week.

2463
02:13:58,990 --> 02:13:59,410
So yeah!

2464
02:13:59,650 --> 02:14:00,490
Also like...

2465
02:14:00,490 --> 02:14:01,450
Starting soon...

2466
02:14:01,450 --> 02:14:02,370
I think you guys might notice...

2467
02:14:02,370 --> 02:14:03,090
I haven't been like...

2468
02:14:03,090 --> 02:14:03,470
Connect...

2469
02:14:03,470 --> 02:14:04,770
Networking very often.

2470
02:14:05,930 --> 02:14:06,410
Um...

2471
02:14:06,410 --> 02:14:07,350
I'm doing a lot of like...

2472
02:14:07,350 --> 02:14:08,010
Fleshy...

2473
02:14:08,010 --> 02:14:08,370
Uh...

2474
02:14:08,370 --> 02:14:09,590
Fleshy collabs.

2475
02:14:09,830 --> 02:14:11,110
It's because like...

2476
02:14:12,050 --> 02:14:12,530
Um...

2477
02:14:12,530 --> 02:14:14,210
With VTubers...

2478
02:14:14,210 --> 02:14:14,870
Um...

2479
02:14:14,870 --> 02:14:16,430
99% of the time...

2480
02:14:16,430 --> 02:14:19,270
I have to set up collabs for the VTuber collabs.

2481
02:14:19,630 --> 02:14:21,130
And I've been so busy.

2482
02:14:21,130 --> 02:14:22,230
And like...

2483
02:14:22,230 --> 02:14:24,070
I've been so busy...

2484
02:14:24,070 --> 02:14:24,290
And like...

2485
02:14:25,290 --> 02:14:25,690
Um...

2486
02:14:25,690 --> 02:14:26,390
You know...

2487
02:14:26,390 --> 02:14:28,310
Although I play some other things personally...

2488
02:14:28,310 --> 02:14:29,050
That...

2489
02:14:29,050 --> 02:14:31,130
I haven't really had time to set up these collabs.

2490
02:14:31,290 --> 02:14:32,210
I think the...

2491
02:14:32,210 --> 02:14:33,350
Bao and Stuffy collabs...

2492
02:14:33,350 --> 02:14:34,030
Been a collabs...

2493
02:14:34,030 --> 02:14:34,770
Like other than like...

2494
02:14:34,770 --> 02:14:35,850
I guess Sloppy Sisters too.

2495
02:14:36,650 --> 02:14:37,050
Um...

2496
02:14:37,050 --> 02:14:37,250
Um...

2497
02:14:37,250 --> 02:14:39,070
I set up the Sloppy Sisters collabs as well.

2498
02:14:39,170 --> 02:14:40,450
Like every time I have...

2499
02:14:40,450 --> 02:14:41,210
Um...

2500
02:14:41,210 --> 02:14:41,830
Like you know...

2501
02:14:41,830 --> 02:14:43,070
All the games I've suggested...

2502
02:14:43,070 --> 02:14:44,230
For Sloppy Sisters collabs.

2503
02:14:44,350 --> 02:14:44,530
Uh...

2504
02:14:44,530 --> 02:14:45,230
I set them up.

2505
02:14:45,770 --> 02:14:46,570
And um...

2506
02:14:46,570 --> 02:14:47,630
So like...

2507
02:14:47,630 --> 02:14:48,010
Uh...

2508
02:14:48,010 --> 02:14:50,210
99% of the collabs I set up with other VTubers...

2509
02:14:50,210 --> 02:14:51,250
I'm the one that...

2510
02:14:51,250 --> 02:14:51,630
Like...

2511
02:14:51,630 --> 02:14:53,210
99% of the collabs I do with VTubers...

2512
02:14:53,910 --> 02:14:54,470
I normally...

2513
02:14:54,470 --> 02:14:55,250
I'm the one...

2514
02:14:55,250 --> 02:14:56,050
That do the invites...

2515
02:14:56,050 --> 02:14:57,030
And set them up and stuff.

2516
02:14:58,070 --> 02:14:58,430
Um...

2517
02:14:58,430 --> 02:14:58,950
But like...

2518
02:14:58,950 --> 02:15:00,650
A lot of the fleshy ones that I join...

2519
02:15:00,650 --> 02:15:01,870
I get invited to them.

2520
02:15:02,750 --> 02:15:03,110
And...

2521
02:15:03,110 --> 02:15:03,630
So like...

2522
02:15:03,630 --> 02:15:03,870
You know...

2523
02:15:03,870 --> 02:15:05,250
I don't have to organize anything.

2524
02:15:05,750 --> 02:15:06,850
I don't have to...

2525
02:15:06,850 --> 02:15:07,150
You know...

2526
02:15:07,150 --> 02:15:07,930
Hit people up.

2527
02:15:08,290 --> 02:15:10,050
They're the ones that invite me...

2528
02:15:10,050 --> 02:15:11,810
To join them in their collabs.

2529
02:15:11,990 --> 02:15:13,490
So that's why I've been doing a lot of those.

2530
02:15:13,630 --> 02:15:14,970
Because they just send me an invite...

2531
02:15:14,970 --> 02:15:15,370
And I'm like...

2532
02:15:15,370 --> 02:15:16,010
Yeah, okay, yeah.

2533
02:15:16,030 --> 02:15:16,470
No problem.

2534
02:15:16,550 --> 02:15:17,150
I can join it.

2535
02:15:17,390 --> 02:15:17,710
Like...

2536
02:15:17,710 --> 02:15:18,390
Stuff like that.

2537
02:15:19,290 --> 02:15:19,650
Um...

2538
02:15:21,610 --> 02:15:22,690
But like...

2539
02:15:22,690 --> 02:15:23,190
VTuber ones...

2540
02:15:23,190 --> 02:15:23,710
Normally...

2541
02:15:23,710 --> 02:15:24,990
I have to organize them myself.

2542
02:15:25,610 --> 02:15:26,170
Uh...

2543
02:15:26,170 --> 02:15:27,150
And invite people.

2544
02:15:27,990 --> 02:15:28,550
Um...

2545
02:15:28,550 --> 02:15:29,230
So...

2546
02:15:29,230 --> 02:15:29,570
Uh...

2547
02:15:29,570 --> 02:15:30,410
That's why I never...

2548
02:15:30,410 --> 02:15:31,510
I haven't had the time to do...

2549
02:15:31,510 --> 02:15:31,790
That...

2550
02:15:32,630 --> 02:15:33,350
For a while.

2551
02:15:34,050 --> 02:15:34,610
Uh...

2552
02:15:34,610 --> 02:15:34,890
So...

2553
02:15:35,710 --> 02:15:36,270
Uh...

2554
02:15:36,270 --> 02:15:36,650
Starting...

2555
02:15:37,370 --> 02:15:37,670
Like...

2556
02:15:37,670 --> 02:15:38,430
Now I'm...

2557
02:15:38,430 --> 02:15:39,390
Going back into it.

2558
02:15:39,550 --> 02:15:40,110
And...

2559
02:15:40,110 --> 02:15:40,610
Soon...

2560
02:15:40,610 --> 02:15:41,150
I want to...

2561
02:15:41,150 --> 02:15:42,050
Not soon...

2562
02:15:42,050 --> 02:15:43,190
But like...

2563
02:15:43,190 --> 02:15:43,770
Um...

2564
02:15:43,770 --> 02:15:45,110
I do want to get into like...

2565
02:15:45,110 --> 02:15:46,670
Meeting new people again.

2566
02:15:47,210 --> 02:15:47,490
Um...

2567
02:15:47,490 --> 02:15:48,690
Like I said, I've been incredibly busy.

2568
02:15:49,170 --> 02:15:49,690
So...

2569
02:15:49,690 --> 02:15:51,130
It's really hard to...

2570
02:15:51,130 --> 02:15:52,290
You know, reach out to people...

2571
02:15:52,290 --> 02:15:53,810
When I'm so busy all the time.

2572
02:15:54,210 --> 02:15:55,570
Trying to fucking fix my life.

2573
02:15:58,950 --> 02:16:00,010
But I'm gonna...

2574
02:16:00,010 --> 02:16:01,650
I'll try to reach out to new people.

2575
02:16:02,630 --> 02:16:02,990
Um...

2576
02:16:02,990 --> 02:16:04,410
Not soon, soon...

2577
02:16:04,410 --> 02:16:06,430
But like...

2578
02:16:06,430 --> 02:16:08,170
Maybe in like a couple...

2579
02:16:08,170 --> 02:16:09,550
Maybe in like two to three weeks.

2580
02:16:10,430 --> 02:16:10,950
Um...

2581
02:16:10,950 --> 02:16:11,890
But yeah.

2582
02:16:12,470 --> 02:16:12,990
Uh...

2583
02:16:12,990 --> 02:16:14,270
For like collabs again.

2584
02:16:14,670 --> 02:16:15,010
Um...

2585
02:16:15,010 --> 02:16:15,850
Also...

2586
02:16:15,850 --> 02:16:16,590
Um...

2587
02:16:16,590 --> 02:16:17,470
Um...

2588
02:16:17,470 --> 02:16:19,470
I realized that...

2589
02:16:20,310 --> 02:16:21,850
It's drawing near...

2590
02:16:21,850 --> 02:16:22,750
To...

2591
02:16:22,750 --> 02:16:23,470
The...

2592
02:16:23,470 --> 02:16:25,150
Anniversary of WrestleTuber.

2593
02:16:26,170 --> 02:16:26,750
And...

2594
02:16:26,750 --> 02:16:28,530
I have not planned anything for that yet.

2595
02:16:28,590 --> 02:16:31,430
Because I've been busy trying to...

2596
02:16:31,430 --> 02:16:32,130
Uh...

2597
02:16:32,130 --> 02:16:32,790
Fix stuff.

2598
02:16:32,950 --> 02:16:34,010
And with other work stuff.

2599
02:16:34,330 --> 02:16:35,430
So most likely...

2600
02:16:35,430 --> 02:16:37,310
WrestleTuber might be delayed...

2601
02:16:37,310 --> 02:16:38,490
Until I...

2602
02:16:38,490 --> 02:16:39,170
Figure it out.

2603
02:16:40,130 --> 02:16:40,710
Until...

2604
02:16:40,710 --> 02:16:41,230
Not figure out.

2605
02:16:41,490 --> 02:16:42,690
Until I...

2606
02:16:43,290 --> 02:16:43,870
Um...

2607
02:16:43,870 --> 02:16:44,970
Get less busy...

2608
02:16:44,970 --> 02:16:46,030
On the...

2609
02:16:46,030 --> 02:16:46,750
Business end.

2610
02:16:46,850 --> 02:16:47,450
And behind the scenes.

2611
02:16:48,370 --> 02:16:48,850
Um...

2612
02:16:48,850 --> 02:16:49,570
I just realized.

2613
02:16:49,650 --> 02:16:50,670
I realized that...

2614
02:16:50,670 --> 02:16:51,070
Like...

2615
02:16:51,070 --> 02:16:51,610
This week.

2616
02:16:51,650 --> 02:16:51,970
I was like...

2617
02:16:51,970 --> 02:16:52,450
Oh shit.

2618
02:16:52,690 --> 02:16:54,550
And I had zero plans for it.

2619
02:16:54,650 --> 02:16:56,130
I've done zero planning for it.

2620
02:16:56,430 --> 02:16:57,590
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2621
02:16:57,730 --> 02:16:58,690
So I think...

2622
02:16:58,690 --> 02:17:00,010
I think it was this month.

2623
02:17:00,090 --> 02:17:01,390
It's supposed to be this month.

2624
02:17:01,710 --> 02:17:01,950
Right?

2625
02:17:02,050 --> 02:17:03,510
It was either supposed to be this month...

2626
02:17:03,510 --> 02:17:04,130
Or next month.

2627
02:17:04,190 --> 02:17:05,410
I forgot already.

2628
02:17:05,850 --> 02:17:06,070
Um...

2629
02:17:06,070 --> 02:17:07,210
I'm not very good with dates.

2630
02:17:07,670 --> 02:17:08,150
But...

2631
02:17:08,150 --> 02:17:08,750
Whatever date.

2632
02:17:08,830 --> 02:17:10,130
If it was supposed to be this month...

2633
02:17:10,130 --> 02:17:10,910
Or next month.

2634
02:17:11,010 --> 02:17:12,170
It definitely...

2635
02:17:12,170 --> 02:17:13,350
Is gonna be delayed.

2636
02:17:13,570 --> 02:17:15,430
Because I've done zero planning for it.

2637
02:17:15,530 --> 02:17:17,050
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2638
02:17:18,830 --> 02:17:19,710
It was on...

2639
02:17:19,710 --> 02:17:20,490
It was in May?

2640
02:17:22,790 --> 02:17:23,330
It was in May?

2641
02:17:23,450 --> 02:17:23,570
Yeah.

2642
02:17:23,690 --> 02:17:24,870
Most likely, it will be...

2643
02:17:24,870 --> 02:17:25,810
It will not...

2644
02:17:25,810 --> 02:17:26,890
It will be delayed.

2645
02:17:26,970 --> 02:17:27,530
Most likely.

2646
02:17:28,090 --> 02:17:28,410
Um...

2647
02:17:28,410 --> 02:17:29,810
I just wanted to let you guys know.

2648
02:17:29,950 --> 02:17:31,250
That if everybody was like...

2649
02:17:31,250 --> 02:17:32,870
Oh, I can't wait for rest of October.

2650
02:17:33,190 --> 02:17:34,110
It's happening soon.

2651
02:17:34,870 --> 02:17:36,170
I just want to say that now.

2652
02:17:36,450 --> 02:17:37,930
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2653
02:17:43,670 --> 02:17:44,030
Um...

2654
02:17:44,030 --> 02:17:44,210
Uh...

2655
02:17:44,730 --> 02:17:45,890
Skelem, thank you for the super chat.

2656
02:17:45,990 --> 02:17:46,190
Thank you.

2657
02:17:46,450 --> 02:17:46,630
Thank you.

2658
02:17:46,690 --> 02:17:48,090
Here's 1 eighth of a Switch game.

2659
02:17:48,090 --> 02:17:50,290
Don't want to see Nintendo have to milk you too badly.

2660
02:17:50,450 --> 02:17:51,750
Thank you for the super chat.

2661
02:17:51,850 --> 02:17:52,330
Thank you.

2662
02:17:52,390 --> 02:17:53,190
Thank you.

2663
02:17:54,750 --> 02:17:55,190
Um...

2664
02:17:55,190 --> 02:17:56,290
Gabbit, thank you for the super chat.

2665
02:17:56,370 --> 02:17:56,550
Thank you.

2666
02:17:56,590 --> 02:17:56,910
Thank you.

2667
02:17:56,950 --> 02:17:59,070
With $90, you can buy all three plushies.

2668
02:17:59,130 --> 02:17:59,650
Oh my God!

2669
02:17:59,670 --> 02:18:00,570
You're so right!

2670
02:18:00,790 --> 02:18:01,230
Guys!

2671
02:18:02,610 --> 02:18:04,010
Did you guys know?

2672
02:18:04,150 --> 02:18:08,410
That there's two days left of the YouTube plushie?

2673
02:18:08,730 --> 02:18:10,450
Oh my God!

2674
02:18:11,090 --> 02:18:11,530
Yes!

2675
02:18:11,650 --> 02:18:12,090
Everybody!

2676
02:18:13,190 --> 02:18:15,130
There's two days left!

2677
02:18:15,190 --> 02:18:16,410
I know it says 72 hours.

2678
02:18:16,410 --> 02:18:21,650
But I can't be bothered to download a new image that shows the countdown right now.

2679
02:18:21,750 --> 02:18:22,700
But yes!

2680
02:18:23,710 --> 02:18:24,440
There's still...

2681
02:18:25,290 --> 02:18:26,770
Less than...

2682
02:18:27,410 --> 02:18:28,370
48 hours!

2683
02:18:29,270 --> 02:18:36,670

2684
02:18:37,130 --> 02:18:37,350

The moment the sale is over, these are gone forever!

2686
02:18:42,830 --> 02:18:44,850
So get them before it's gone forever!

2687
02:18:46,290 --> 02:18:46,610
Yippee!

2688
02:18:48,410 --> 02:18:49,130
You know what?

2689
02:18:49,150 --> 02:18:50,150
I'll just put this here for now.

2690
02:18:51,490 --> 02:18:52,090
But yeah!

2691
02:18:52,390 --> 02:18:53,610

02:18:56,050 --> 02:18:56,690
Let's see...

2694
02:18:56,690 --> 02:18:57,870
Where else was I on?

2695
02:18:57,870 --> 02:19:00,210
I'll do like three more super chats and then I'm gonna call it here.

2696
02:19:01,870 --> 02:19:02,390
I'm done!

2697
02:19:02,470 --> 02:19:03,130
Thank you for the super chat!

2698
02:19:03,190 --> 02:19:03,410
Thank you!

2699
02:19:03,490 --> 02:19:03,870
Thank you!

2700
02:19:03,990 --> 02:19:06,170
Mods, put a speedrun timer on the screen!

2701
02:19:06,310 --> 02:19:07,230
Thank you for the super chat!

2702
02:19:07,290 --> 02:19:07,550
Thank you!

2703
02:19:07,610 --> 02:19:08,070
Thank you!

2704
02:19:08,550 --> 02:19:09,010
Next scene!

2705
02:19:09,070 --> 02:19:09,810
Thank you for the super chat!

2706
02:19:09,890 --> 02:19:10,130
Thank you!

2707
02:19:10,170 --> 02:19:10,710
Thank you!

2708
02:19:15,610 --> 02:19:16,650
Thank you for the super chat!

2709
02:19:16,830 --> 02:19:16,950
Thank you!

2710
02:19:16,990 --> 02:19:17,410
Thank you!

2711
02:19:17,450 --> 02:19:23,430
I played this game when I was like six or seven and thought it was too easy for reference to how for kids this game is.

2712
02:19:23,570 --> 02:19:24,290
Thank you for the super chat!

2713
02:19:24,370 --> 02:19:24,570
Thank you!

2714
02:19:24,630 --> 02:19:25,010
Thank you!

2715
02:19:25,230 --> 02:19:27,530
I don't remember...

2716
02:19:28,330 --> 02:19:29,350
If I saw it...

2717
02:19:29,350 --> 02:19:30,270
I think like...

2718
02:19:30,270 --> 02:19:32,830
I just really enjoyed like...

2719
02:19:32,830 --> 02:19:33,830
You know how like...

2720
02:19:33,830 --> 02:19:34,750
You know as a child?

2721
02:19:34,990 --> 02:19:37,330
And that's how like people get you with YouTube Kids?

2722
02:19:38,390 --> 02:19:41,730
That's how the Spider-Man Elsa people got away with it for so long?

2723
02:19:41,730 --> 02:19:44,890
Like children don't really care?

2724
02:19:46,090 --> 02:19:47,210
But like...

2725
02:19:47,210 --> 02:19:49,790
Like okay, they care, but like also...

2726
02:19:49,790 --> 02:19:53,170
It's very easy to like...

2727
02:19:54,250 --> 02:19:57,030
It's very easy to like...

2728
02:19:57,410 --> 02:19:59,470
Just grab a child's attention.

2729
02:19:59,870 --> 02:20:01,750
And then it's just like...

2730
02:20:06,230 --> 02:20:07,830
It's like...

2731
02:20:07,830 --> 02:20:11,350
They just put flashy things on the screen and then...

2732
02:20:11,350 --> 02:20:12,570
They're satisfied.

2733
02:20:12,710 --> 02:20:14,430
And that was me as a child.

2734
02:20:14,550 --> 02:20:20,230
I like replayed these Humongous games so many times because I was just like...

2735
02:20:27,030 --> 02:20:33,670
And then I would click that so many times because I was just so easily amused.

2736
02:20:33,770 --> 02:20:34,350
I was like...

2737
02:20:44,930 --> 02:20:45,830
And the thing is...

2738
02:20:46,310 --> 02:20:48,230
I replayed it so many times.

2739
02:20:48,410 --> 02:20:49,690
I know how the story ends.

2740
02:20:49,770 --> 02:20:50,890
I know how the story goes.

2741
02:20:51,110 --> 02:20:52,210
I know how the story ends.

2742
02:20:52,370 --> 02:20:53,990
I know how the puzzles are like.

2743
02:20:54,450 --> 02:20:56,230
But I still played it like...

2744
02:20:56,230 --> 02:20:59,470
Replayed it so much because I just enjoyed it.

2745
02:20:59,510 --> 02:21:00,170
I just enjoyed it.

2746
02:21:00,210 --> 02:21:01,470
Like I was just brain rotted again.

2747
02:21:03,410 --> 02:21:05,210
I was the...

2748
02:21:05,210 --> 02:21:06,710
Prototype iPad kid.

2749
02:21:06,790 --> 02:21:07,610
I was like...

2750
02:21:07,610 --> 02:21:08,870
Let's go again!

2751
02:21:09,730 --> 02:21:10,170
Yippee!

2752
02:21:12,530 --> 02:21:13,570
I just...

2753
02:21:13,570 --> 02:21:14,190
I just...

2754
02:21:14,190 --> 02:21:17,150
I was very easily amused as a child.

2755
02:21:19,490 --> 02:21:21,070
Like the fact that I played the...

2756
02:21:21,070 --> 02:21:23,990
I remember playing the Blue's Clue's Treasure Hunt so many times.

2757
02:21:24,110 --> 02:21:25,370
But like...

2758
02:21:25,370 --> 02:21:26,550
It's the same story.

2759
02:21:26,670 --> 02:21:27,650
It's the same story.

2760
02:21:27,770 --> 02:21:28,710
It's the same ending.

2761
02:21:29,450 --> 02:21:31,030
It's the same puzzles.

2762
02:21:31,330 --> 02:21:32,070
But I was like...

2763
02:21:32,070 --> 02:21:33,010
Blue's got two.

2764
02:21:33,290 --> 02:21:34,110
We got two!

2765
02:21:35,070 --> 02:21:35,970
And then he's like...

2766
02:21:35,970 --> 02:21:37,550
Let's go to the faking chair.

2767
02:21:39,630 --> 02:21:40,150
It was...

2768
02:21:40,150 --> 02:21:40,830
It was just...

2769
02:21:40,830 --> 02:21:41,010
Yeah.

2770
02:21:41,230 --> 02:21:42,750
I was farming my dopamine.

2771
02:21:43,090 --> 02:21:43,930
Because I did...

2772
02:21:43,930 --> 02:21:45,010
As a child, you know.

2773
02:21:45,130 --> 02:21:47,330
I haven't discovered competitive gaming yet.

2774
02:21:47,570 --> 02:21:49,170
And this is how I farm my dopamine.

2775
02:21:49,910 --> 02:21:50,530
Oh yeah.

2776
02:21:50,730 --> 02:21:52,110
Speaking of competitive gaming.

2777
02:21:53,110 --> 02:21:54,930
God, I wish I recorded a game.

2778
02:21:56,330 --> 02:21:56,810
But...

2779
02:21:56,810 --> 02:21:59,270
For those who didn't watch my Marvel Rivals stream.

2780
02:21:59,630 --> 02:22:00,570
I found out...

2781
02:22:00,570 --> 02:22:02,150
So I three stacked with...

2782
02:22:02,830 --> 02:22:03,910
I met a new person.

2783
02:22:04,950 --> 02:22:05,670
And like...

2784
02:22:05,670 --> 02:22:06,950
I've heard about this guy before.

2785
02:22:07,490 --> 02:22:08,490
Like in the...

2786
02:22:09,650 --> 02:22:10,130
Like...

2787
02:22:10,130 --> 02:22:10,350
Ranked scene.

2788
02:22:10,430 --> 02:22:11,730
Not competitive in the ranked scene.

2789
02:22:11,810 --> 02:22:12,570
Because he's like everywhere.

2790
02:22:13,170 --> 02:22:13,990
And like...

2791
02:22:13,990 --> 02:22:15,250
There was this guy named Sakura.

2792
02:22:15,750 --> 02:22:17,090
Who joined Pizza and I.

2793
02:22:17,630 --> 02:22:18,850
Pizza and I...

2794
02:22:18,850 --> 02:22:19,790
Into a three stack.

2795
02:22:19,930 --> 02:22:21,070
Because I thought it was so funny.

2796
02:22:21,310 --> 02:22:23,090
Watching those two argue with each other.

2797
02:22:23,190 --> 02:22:24,110
And they were both...

2798
02:22:24,110 --> 02:22:25,430
Consented to like...

2799
02:22:25,430 --> 02:22:27,290
Being put together in a three stack.

2800
02:22:27,410 --> 02:22:28,930
To continue arguing for us.

2801
02:22:29,290 --> 02:22:30,130
For our...

2802
02:22:30,130 --> 02:22:31,450
Fucking entertainment, I guess.

2803
02:22:31,530 --> 02:22:31,970
Like...

2804
02:22:31,970 --> 02:22:33,390
We live in a society.

2805
02:22:34,970 --> 02:22:37,030
And I found out...

2806
02:22:37,030 --> 02:22:38,130
That Sakura...

2807
02:22:38,130 --> 02:22:39,750
What is...

2808
02:22:39,750 --> 02:22:40,470
Is...

2809
02:22:40,470 --> 02:22:42,970
A professional rage baiter.

2810
02:22:43,330 --> 02:22:43,910
So...

2811
02:22:43,910 --> 02:22:45,170
I played...

2812
02:22:45,170 --> 02:22:46,130
Three games...

2813
02:22:46,670 --> 02:22:47,350
Off stream.

2814
02:22:47,590 --> 02:22:48,240
Because like...

2815
02:22:49,210 --> 02:22:50,380
Sakura was like...

2816
02:22:51,350 --> 02:22:53,150
I saw what his ELO was.

2817
02:22:53,270 --> 02:22:54,410
I literally straight up told him.

2818
02:22:54,750 --> 02:22:56,630
I wanna see if I can take you to Celestial.

2819
02:22:57,570 --> 02:22:58,150
And...

2820
02:22:58,150 --> 02:22:59,870
I wasn't throwing.

2821
02:23:00,310 --> 02:23:01,590
I just knew...

2822
02:23:01,590 --> 02:23:02,130
That like...

2823
02:23:03,030 --> 02:23:05,310
The games were not gonna be ideal.

2824
02:23:10,210 --> 02:23:11,090
So...

2825
02:23:11,090 --> 02:23:11,530
Um...

2826
02:23:11,770 --> 02:23:12,210
So...

2827
02:23:12,770 --> 02:23:13,350
My...

2828
02:23:13,350 --> 02:23:14,150
Final...

2829
02:23:14,150 --> 02:23:16,230
Literally every game...

2830
02:23:16,230 --> 02:23:17,130
Was just...

2831
02:23:18,110 --> 02:23:18,990
Him...

2832
02:23:18,990 --> 02:23:19,850
And...

2833
02:23:19,850 --> 02:23:21,610
Three other people...

2834
02:23:21,610 --> 02:23:23,990
Just yelling and screaming at each other.

2835
02:23:24,530 --> 02:23:25,810
Throughout the game.

2836
02:23:30,350 --> 02:23:31,230
And...

2837
02:23:31,230 --> 02:23:32,790
I wish I recorded...

2838
02:23:33,530 --> 02:23:34,830
The last game.

2839
02:23:35,190 --> 02:23:36,990
Because the last game...

2840
02:23:36,990 --> 02:23:37,970
Like...

2841
02:23:37,970 --> 02:23:39,050
They were like...

2842
02:23:42,190 --> 02:23:44,290
They were like...

2843
02:23:44,290 --> 02:23:44,570
Avoid me.

2844
02:23:44,690 --> 02:23:45,590
No, avoid me.

2845
02:23:45,730 --> 02:23:46,130
I...

2846
02:23:47,090 --> 02:23:49,530
I don't wanna waste my voice line on you.

2847
02:23:49,890 --> 02:23:50,730
And then...

2848
02:23:50,730 --> 02:23:51,530
Sakura was like...

2849
02:23:51,530 --> 02:23:52,610
No, you avoid...

2850
02:23:52,610 --> 02:23:52,950
I...

2851
02:23:52,950 --> 02:23:53,610
You avoid me.

2852
02:23:53,710 --> 02:23:54,990
And I'm gonna fucking farm your ass.

2853
02:23:55,070 --> 02:23:55,790
I'm better than you.

2854
02:23:56,050 --> 02:23:56,390
I...

2855
02:23:58,670 --> 02:24:00,030
I know everybody.

2856
02:24:01,390 --> 02:24:02,270
Pro players...

2857
02:24:02,270 --> 02:24:03,390
Think I'm the GOAT.

2858
02:24:04,370 --> 02:24:05,250
Think I'm...

2859
02:24:05,250 --> 02:24:06,810
That's why they play with me.

2860
02:24:06,890 --> 02:24:08,190
And I'm just like...

2861
02:24:10,050 --> 02:24:10,460
Meanwhile...

2862
02:24:10,870 --> 02:24:12,030
Me and the other support...

2863
02:24:12,030 --> 02:24:12,850
The two people...

2864
02:24:12,850 --> 02:24:14,610
That aren't saying anything...

2865
02:24:14,610 --> 02:24:15,220
Are getting...

2866
02:24:15,710 --> 02:24:16,540
Hard died...

2867
02:24:16,950 --> 02:24:17,490
By...

2868
02:24:17,490 --> 02:24:18,570
Spider-Man...

2869
02:24:18,570 --> 02:24:19,670
Venom...

2870
02:24:22,510 --> 02:24:23,330
Panther...

2871
02:24:24,450 --> 02:24:25,990
All three of...

2872
02:24:25,990 --> 02:24:26,630
Two of...

2873
02:24:26,630 --> 02:24:27,990
Me and my other support...

2874
02:24:27,990 --> 02:24:28,970
Are getting...

2875
02:24:28,970 --> 02:24:29,870
Hard died...

2876
02:24:29,870 --> 02:24:30,830
By Spider-Man...

2877
02:24:30,830 --> 02:24:31,250
Venom...

2878
02:24:31,250 --> 02:24:32,090
And Panther...

2879
02:24:32,090 --> 02:24:34,190
And nobody was helping us.

2880
02:24:38,370 --> 02:24:38,850
Well...

2881
02:24:40,470 --> 02:24:40,950
Well...

2882
02:24:40,950 --> 02:24:42,730
Four of my teammates...

2883
02:24:42,730 --> 02:24:43,270
Were just...

2884
02:24:43,270 --> 02:24:44,270
Non-stop...

2885
02:24:44,270 --> 02:24:45,390
Yelling at each other...

2886
02:24:45,390 --> 02:24:46,790
The entire time.

2887
02:24:47,210 --> 02:24:47,650
And...

2888
02:24:49,790 --> 02:24:51,290
And they were like...

2889
02:24:51,290 --> 02:24:51,830
They were like...

2890
02:24:51,830 --> 02:24:52,470
What the...

2891
02:24:52,470 --> 02:24:53,490
I don't remember the fucking play...

2892
02:24:53,490 --> 02:24:54,930
It was like...

2893
02:24:54,930 --> 02:24:55,670
Oh my god...

2894
02:24:55,670 --> 02:24:56,130
I remember...

2895
02:24:56,130 --> 02:24:58,690
I remember...

2896
02:24:59,250 --> 02:24:59,730
Okay...

2897
02:24:59,730 --> 02:25:01,250
So, one of the quotes I remembered...

2898
02:25:01,250 --> 02:25:01,990
Was like...

2899
02:25:02,710 --> 02:25:04,170
You're the only one on your team...

2900
02:25:04,810 --> 02:25:07,310
None of us are on our mains right now...

2901
02:25:10,650 --> 02:25:11,610
And then...

2902
02:25:14,370 --> 02:25:14,850
Sakura...

2903
02:25:14,850 --> 02:25:15,830
Was like...

2904
02:25:15,830 --> 02:25:17,010
You don't know that...

2905
02:25:17,010 --> 02:25:18,030
I could be on my main...

2906
02:25:18,030 --> 02:25:19,290
On my alt account right now...

2907
02:25:19,790 --> 02:25:20,110
And then...

2908
02:25:20,110 --> 02:25:21,170
One of the other guys...

2909
02:25:21,170 --> 02:25:21,830
Was like...

2910
02:25:21,830 --> 02:25:23,090
You're level 61!

2911
02:25:26,190 --> 02:25:27,150
You have...

2912
02:25:27,150 --> 02:25:29,050
OW in your name...

2913
02:25:29,050 --> 02:25:31,050
Nobody who has an alt account...

2914
02:25:31,050 --> 02:25:32,110
Would name them...

2915
02:25:32,110 --> 02:25:33,570
With an OW...

2916
02:25:34,170 --> 02:25:35,170
I mean...

2917
02:25:38,650 --> 02:25:40,130
And then...

2918
02:25:40,130 --> 02:25:43,480
It was very hard to concentrate...

2919
02:25:43,830 --> 02:25:46,170
It was incredibly hard to concentrate...

2920
02:25:47,410 --> 02:25:48,150
Guys...

2921
02:25:48,930 --> 02:25:49,970
And then...

2922
02:25:49,970 --> 02:25:51,590
And then the Bucky player...

2923
02:25:51,590 --> 02:25:52,170
Was like...

2924
02:25:52,750 --> 02:25:54,450
I'm not even taking this seriously...

2925
02:25:54,450 --> 02:25:56,630
And I'm carrying your fucking fat ass...

2926
02:25:56,630 --> 02:25:57,610
Right now...

2927
02:25:57,610 --> 02:26:02,170
And I'm still doing everything...

2928
02:26:02,170 --> 02:26:04,290
What the fuck are you doing?

2929
02:26:06,590 --> 02:26:08,550
I'm on a fucking alt account...

2930
02:26:08,550 --> 02:26:10,610
And I'm still doing better than you...

2931
02:26:13,910 --> 02:26:15,350
It was...

2932
02:26:15,350 --> 02:26:16,590
It was...

2933
02:26:16,590 --> 02:26:17,350
It was...

2934
02:26:17,350 --> 02:26:18,170
Oh my god...

2935
02:26:19,010 --> 02:26:19,230
Like...

2936
02:26:19,230 --> 02:26:20,690
I legitimately couldn't think...

2937
02:26:20,690 --> 02:26:21,230
At all...

2938
02:26:21,230 --> 02:26:21,430
Like...

2939
02:26:21,430 --> 02:26:23,170
It was just non-stop screaming...

2940
02:26:23,970 --> 02:26:25,790
I wish I recorded it...

2941
02:26:25,790 --> 02:26:26,430
It was so...

2942
02:26:27,230 --> 02:26:28,170
It was actually...

2943
02:26:28,790 --> 02:26:30,410
A wild ride...

2944
02:26:36,710 --> 02:26:37,670
Yeah...

2945
02:26:37,670 --> 02:26:39,190
So...

2946
02:26:39,190 --> 02:26:40,390
Oh my god...

2947
02:26:40,390 --> 02:26:40,870
But...

2948
02:26:40,870 --> 02:26:43,210
What I realized is that...

2949
02:26:43,210 --> 02:26:45,510
I realized then...

2950
02:26:45,510 --> 02:26:47,870
That like...

2951
02:26:50,750 --> 02:26:51,710
Like...

2952
02:26:51,710 --> 02:26:54,830
The existence of professional rage baiters...

2953
02:26:54,830 --> 02:26:55,970
Like their entire...

2954
02:26:55,970 --> 02:26:58,510
Existence in that game...

2955
02:26:58,510 --> 02:26:59,770
Was to just...

2956
02:26:59,770 --> 02:27:01,830
Make people angry...

2957
02:27:01,830 --> 02:27:02,150
Like...

2958
02:27:02,150 --> 02:27:03,530
He would say...

2959
02:27:03,950 --> 02:27:05,250
Just random shit...

2960
02:27:05,910 --> 02:27:07,470
That he knows...

2961
02:27:07,470 --> 02:27:10,390
Would piss someone off...

2962
02:27:11,150 --> 02:27:13,010
On our own team...

2963
02:27:13,010 --> 02:27:18,430
On my own fucking team...

2964
02:27:19,610 --> 02:27:20,030
Like...

2965
02:27:20,030 --> 02:27:21,950
We were not winning any...

2966
02:27:21,950 --> 02:27:22,510
We were...

2967
02:27:22,830 --> 02:27:24,370
I knew it was like...

2968
02:27:24,370 --> 02:27:25,230
Actual...

2969
02:27:25,230 --> 02:27:26,470
GGs...

2970
02:27:26,470 --> 02:27:28,270
On character select...

2971
02:27:33,890 --> 02:27:36,050
Oh my god...

2972
02:27:36,050 --> 02:27:36,450
Um...

2973
02:27:37,230 --> 02:27:37,870
But yeah...

2974
02:27:37,870 --> 02:27:38,570
Next time...

2975
02:27:38,570 --> 02:27:39,290
If like...

2976
02:27:39,290 --> 02:27:40,950
That ever happens again...

2977
02:27:40,950 --> 02:27:43,650
I'll give you guys a recording of...

2978
02:27:43,650 --> 02:27:44,450
Of it...

2979
02:27:44,450 --> 02:27:45,390
It was actually...

2980
02:27:45,390 --> 02:27:45,610
It...

2981
02:27:45,610 --> 02:27:45,930
No...

2982
02:27:45,930 --> 02:27:46,410
I...

2983
02:27:46,410 --> 02:27:47,550
I know like...

2984
02:27:47,550 --> 02:27:48,410
Me saying it...

2985
02:27:48,410 --> 02:27:49,530
Does not...

2986
02:27:49,530 --> 02:27:51,170
Does not reflect...

2987
02:27:51,170 --> 02:27:52,550
How fucking...

2988
02:27:52,550 --> 02:27:54,590
Crazy that game was...

2989
02:27:54,590 --> 02:27:54,990
Like...

2990
02:27:55,870 --> 02:27:56,270
I...

2991
02:27:56,670 --> 02:27:59,270
There was literally like...

2992
02:27:59,270 --> 02:28:00,590
No moment...

2993
02:28:00,590 --> 02:28:02,130
Where they didn't stop yelling...

2994
02:28:02,130 --> 02:28:03,030
Each other...

2995
02:28:03,030 --> 02:28:04,110
You know what I mean?

2996
02:28:04,490 --> 02:28:05,170
There was...

2997
02:28:05,170 --> 02:28:07,290
There was...

2998
02:28:07,290 --> 02:28:07,970
There was...

2999
02:28:07,970 --> 02:28:09,450
It was just...

3000
02:28:09,450 --> 02:28:09,810
Just...

3001
02:28:09,810 --> 02:28:11,390
I could not think...

3002
02:28:11,390 --> 02:28:12,070
Next time...

3003
02:28:12,070 --> 02:28:13,550
I will give you guys a recording...

3004
02:28:13,550 --> 02:28:15,390
It was absolutely crazy...

3005
02:28:15,390 --> 02:28:15,990
Like...

3006
02:28:15,990 --> 02:28:17,430
I was not...

3007
02:28:17,730 --> 02:28:18,890
I was just...

3008
02:28:18,890 --> 02:28:20,430
Watching the show...

3009
02:28:20,430 --> 02:28:21,190
As it unfolds...

3010
02:28:22,230 --> 02:28:23,450
The funniest part...

3011
02:28:23,450 --> 02:28:25,010
Is that we could have won...

3012
02:28:25,010 --> 02:28:25,670
If like...

3013
02:28:25,670 --> 02:28:27,630
The team was not screaming...

3014
02:28:27,630 --> 02:28:28,390
At each other...

3015
02:28:33,950 --> 02:28:34,430
But...

3016
02:28:34,430 --> 02:28:35,070
I'll give you guys...

3017
02:28:35,070 --> 02:28:37,050
I'll get a recording next time...

3018
02:28:37,050 --> 02:28:39,590
If I ever do it again...

3019
02:28:45,990 --> 02:28:46,890
Let's see...

3020
02:28:46,890 --> 02:28:48,310
I'll do one more super chat guys...

3021
02:28:50,430 --> 02:28:50,910
Alright...

3022
02:28:59,290 --> 02:28:59,770
HongGeorge!

3023
02:28:59,850 --> 02:29:00,650
Thank you for this...

3024
02:29:00,650 --> 02:29:01,470
Oh wait, actually no...

3025
02:29:01,470 --> 02:29:02,590
Sorry HongGeorge...

3026
02:29:02,590 --> 02:29:03,710
Sorry HongGeorge...

3027
02:29:05,250 --> 02:29:06,670
Actually, I'll do two...

3028
02:29:06,670 --> 02:29:08,650
I'll feel bad if I take away your right...

3029
02:29:10,790 --> 02:29:11,870
You know, it's like...

3030
02:29:11,870 --> 02:29:12,670
You win the gacha...

3031
02:29:13,230 --> 02:29:14,670
And then you get a gold pull...

3032
02:29:14,670 --> 02:29:15,570
And then the...

3033
02:29:15,570 --> 02:29:16,290
And then...

3034
02:29:16,290 --> 02:29:17,870
Like the server maintenance...

3035
02:29:17,870 --> 02:29:18,930
Hits you guys...

3036
02:29:18,930 --> 02:29:19,970
In the middle of it...

3037
02:29:19,970 --> 02:29:20,750
And then it's like...

3038
02:29:21,210 --> 02:29:21,650
Sorry...

3039
02:29:21,650 --> 02:29:23,410
We weren't able to keep your data...

3040
02:29:23,410 --> 02:29:26,650
From the server...

3041
02:29:26,650 --> 02:29:29,250
We weren't able to take your data...

3042
02:29:29,250 --> 02:29:30,830
We weren't able to save the data...

3043
02:29:30,830 --> 02:29:31,530
To the server...

3044
02:29:31,530 --> 02:29:33,250
In the middle of the server maintenance...

3045
02:29:34,630 --> 02:29:35,030
Anyway...

3046
02:29:35,030 --> 02:29:36,330
HongGeorge, thank you for the super chat...

3047
02:29:36,330 --> 02:29:36,630
Thank you...

3048
02:29:37,390 --> 02:29:38,410
It got rolled back...

3049
02:29:45,970 --> 02:29:47,530
Thank you for the super chat...

3050
02:29:47,530 --> 02:29:47,790
Thank you...

3051
02:29:47,790 --> 02:29:49,330
God, I wish...

3052
02:29:49,330 --> 02:29:49,950
I wish...

3053
02:29:49,950 --> 02:29:52,350
I have to write my physical letter...

3054
02:29:52,930 --> 02:29:53,330
Today...

3055
02:29:53,330 --> 02:29:54,510
To fucking send...

3056
02:29:54,510 --> 02:29:54,930
To the...

3057
02:29:54,930 --> 02:29:56,310
My tax center...

3058
02:29:56,310 --> 02:29:57,030
And then wait...

3059
02:29:57,030 --> 02:29:58,050
15 days!

3060
02:29:59,250 --> 02:29:59,350
Yay!

3061
02:30:01,150 --> 02:30:01,750
Yay!

3062
02:30:05,570 --> 02:30:06,470
Let's see...

3063
02:30:06,770 --> 02:30:07,610
Where was it?

3064
02:30:08,530 --> 02:30:10,010
Thank you for the super chat...

3065
02:30:10,010 --> 02:30:11,050
Thank you...

3066
02:30:11,050 --> 02:30:12,070
Hi Doki...

3067
02:30:12,070 --> 02:30:14,010
My birthday was on April 1st...

3068
02:30:14,010 --> 02:30:15,430
But my super chat didn't get through...

3069
02:30:15,830 --> 02:30:16,870
I can still get a happy birthday?

3070
02:30:16,930 --> 02:30:17,490
