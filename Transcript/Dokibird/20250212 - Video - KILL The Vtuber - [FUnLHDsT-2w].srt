1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,260
Hello, hello everyone!

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:04,880
Actual rare edited pre-recorded Doki here.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,980
So, today is a very special day.

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,840
That's why I'm pre-recorded.

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:17,600
Because I got sponsored by Legacy Steel and Sorcery to check out their game and its early access.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,620
Huge shout-out and thank you to the dev team for reaching out.

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,240
It would mean a lot, Dragoons, if you could check out the link in the description below.

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,740
Alright, take it away pre-recorded Doki and your bad reaction with no chat to enable you.

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,740
I don't know how this is gonna go, not gonna lie.

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,820
Oh man, I don't know how it's gonna be like.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,680
Well, first time for everything.

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,360
Alright, pre-recorded Doki, it's your turn.

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,220
I mean, I'm pre-recorded too, but...

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,520
Alright, so I was asked to check out the trailer before I play the game.

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,580
And I'm gonna be frank with you guys, I have no idea what this game is about yet.

16
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:55,100
Because like, you know, the best part is to figure this out as we go along.

17
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:55,820
So I...

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,360
Good job, Doki, you're sponsored!

19
00:00:59,320 --> 00:00:59,760
Anyway...

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,640
I mean, I'm like going in blind for things.

21
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,920
Anyway, let's see what this trailer is about, guys.

22
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,960
It's a little weird not having chat to like tell me I'm an idiot.

23
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,300
But it's okay, that's what my inner demons are for.

24
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,300
Oh, it's like an RPG element to it.

25
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,900
Legacy, Steel and...

26
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,040
That's what we're gonna play!

27
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,900
There has to be like different classes and stuff.

28
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,560
Oh, I hope the volume is not too loud.

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,080
Thank you, Notorious Studios!

30
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,180
Check out the game in the description!

31
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,420
Oh, shit.

32
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,480
There's like orcs.

33
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,360
If I'm swearing this, thank God my editor is bleeping me out.

34
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,260
Looks like a game where I'm gonna die a lot.

35
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,660
Oh, is this like PvP?

36
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,920
There's PvP in there.

37
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,020
Goodbye!

38
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,760
Wait, I can sleep them?

39
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,640
Oh my God, I can steal your shit!

40
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,860
Harvest resources.

41
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:48,900
Okay.

42
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,140
Why don't I just choose an auction house and I could bypass the crafting part.

43
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,000
I must again ask for some donations.

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,180
Escape with this.

45
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,220
Oh, it's an extraction!

46
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,720
It's a medieval extraction shooter!

47
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,840
Oh, this has to be it, right?

48
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,880
Oh, that's interesting.

49
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,100
I've never seen an extraction shooter but with like bows and swords.

50
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,240
Wait, no, I have.

51
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,880
I guess like this is more like open world-ish because the other one was like in a dungeon.

52
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,840
So this one is more like an open world.

53
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,880
Okay, that's interesting.

54
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,500
I guess we check out the game now.

55
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,280
I'm putting this really close by the way.

56
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,040
This is like it's two hours before the playtest ends.

57
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,640
I'm cutting it real close right now.

58
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,880
Oh, it's an hour and a half till the playtest ends.

59
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,040
Oh, I wanna be the hunter.

60
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,900
The fact that she could stun?

61
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,100
Wait,

62
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,440
actually, I don't know now.

63
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,460
Which one's the stun?

64
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,300
Oh, but then I could be invisible.

65
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,360
I feel like I'm gonna try bow first because it's like a gun but like medieval.

66
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,700
Not jokey.

67
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,120
They'll never know.

68
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,080
They'll never know it's not me.

69
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,840
Play tutorial?

70
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,860
Yes, please.

71
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,740
I think I definitely need the tutorial.

72
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,520
Oh, I have the seed bomb.

73
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,040
This is my seed bomb.

74
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,420
What's three?

75
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,940
What am I doing?

76
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,000
Oh, shoot.

77
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,900
Okay, I don't see any cooldowns.

78
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,820
Yeah, I assume it's because like I'm not in the game yet.

79
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,540
So that's why I don't have any cooldowns.

80
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,500
What do I have?

81
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,500
Iron chest?

82
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,300
Uh, better.

83
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,440
Wait, I want this.

84
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,840
Yeah, I got better bow now.

85
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:33,300
Hello?

86
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,980
Any NPCs for me to kill because I'm in tutorial right now?

87
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,440
I guess I just have to at the top.

88
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,220
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

89
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,720
Okay, left is dodge.

90
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,540
Oh my gosh, that's a headshot.

91
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,980
What the fuck?

92
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,220
Okay, I'm gonna shoot your leg.

93
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,020
Oh, I should let them...

94
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:50,980
Okay, now I understand.

95
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,240
Okay, I'm just stupid.

96
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:52,900
Alright, shoot.

97
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,560
Attack me.

98
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:53,860
Come on.

99
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:54,640
Haha!

100
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,680
So predictable.

101
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,820
Oh my god, why are you so tanky though?

102
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,300
I wonder how do I...

103
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,020
I guess I'll just have to drag it for now.

104
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,160
There must be a quick way.

105
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,960
I don't have chat to backstab me.

106
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,740
So this is a very rare opportunity.

107
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,300
I have to actually figure this out myself.

108
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,020
Because I have no chat to backstab me.

109
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:16,660
No!

110
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,300
Pre-recorded doki.

111
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,600
Why must you suffer?

112
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,240
Oh my god.

113
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,200
And I get bombed?

114
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,300
Oh, if chat was here, they would have stopped me from getting bombed.

115
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,900
Can I take it?

116
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,620
Oh, there we go.

117
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,300
Am I just stupid?

118
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,480
No, okay, now I can have...

119
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,580
Oh, okay, it just bugged out.

120
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,180
Now I can't.

121
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,040
Oh my gosh, thank god chat can't be like, yeah, you are.

122
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,640
Oh, you can't say that.

123
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,340
Oh, shit!

124
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,540
Oh my god, what were you gonna do?

125
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,760
I'll never know.

126
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,360
Thank god there's no limited ammo.

127
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,480
I was gonna freak out if there was.

128
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,320
I should actually use my other abilities.

129
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,400
I'm not learning.

130
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,060
Do I actually ever learn?

131
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,540
Hehe.

132
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,440
Open.

133
00:04:59,420 --> 00:04:59,820
Rotate.

134
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:05,340
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

135
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,260
Alright, got my Tetris in.

136
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,900
It's okay, I was seeing it so badly.

137
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,560
Whoa!

138
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,200
Damn goblins!

139
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,620
That's right, I used an ability and I missed.

140
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,620
Oh my god.

141
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,820
Wait, why is he going in the trap?

142
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:19,920
No!

143
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,700
Oh, no.

144
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,620
Okay, that's right, I have aim at least.

145
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,220
Hahaha!

146
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,240
Despite everything, at least I have A.

147
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,120
How do I... I want to put this in my... in my belt.

148
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,560
I could, right?

149
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,680
I figure I have to put stuff in my belt, though.

150
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,780
Oh, I have a skill tree.

151
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,880
Oh, not Doki, not Doki.

152
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,840
Yep, in the house of not Doki.

153
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,260
This is not Doki.

154
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,600
I'll figure this out.

155
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,460
But does she?

156
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,800
We'll find out later.

157
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,180
Future prerecorded Doki is gonna figure out if she figures this out.

158
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,760
Oh, and then I can get extracted.

159
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,240
She'll figure this out, right, guys?

160
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,460
Guys, I swear I'll figure this out.

161
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,180
Wait, what are the items I got?

162
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,920
Wait, do I not get to keep my items in Tutorial?

163
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:04,920
No!

164
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:16,730
That's so... I never got to keep... I never got to keep it in Tutorial!

165
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,850
I'm doing mixed.

166
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,170
I don't want to do this by myself.

167
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,150
I don't want to... All right, let's actually do a real game.

168
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,550
Oh, so there's, like, fireplace.

169
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,390
I get to cook in the fireplace.

170
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,210
Oh, so I can get XP when I'm not playing.

171
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,390
Oh, that's interesting.

172
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,230
Oh my god, there's a critter habitat!

173
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,690
I can tap pets!

174
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,450
That was the best game already.

175
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,650
I get to tap pets.

176
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,830
Oh, I get to make, like, weaponsmith, treasurer.

177
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,890
Oh, the artwork's so... Are these, like, 3D?

178
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:45,930
I can't tell.

179
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,130
I love the graphics for it, though.

180
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,210
I love the goblin.

181
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,530
He looks like he is a bad person.

182
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:55,150
I can't say that!

183
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,750
That's prejudice against goblins!

184
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,070
What have they done for us?

185
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,030
What have they done?

186
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,010
Oh my god, that was fast.

187
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,590
Oh, wow, I did not expect that to be really fast.

188
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,150
Oh, man, I hope I have teammates.

189
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,670
That's all I care about.

190
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,430
Wait, is this... Wait, I don't have teammates.

191
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,510
Did I forget to click fill?

192
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,590
No, I don't have teammates.

193
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,610
This is not good for me.

194
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,710
Oh, I forgot.

195
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,710
I must have forgot to press fill, because I know that could be me.

196
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,610
I will not be... What?!

197
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,990
Okay, that was bullshit.

198
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,290
That was actually bullshit.

199
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,530
That should have dodged.

200
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,710
That's actually so messed up.

201
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:28,990
Wait, what?

202
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,170
Why did I accidentally use my fire?

203
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:32,390
Oh, no.

204
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:35,010
Everything's already not going for Ridoki.

205
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,430
Oh, I'm so scared.

206
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,190
I'm actually scared, because I... I'm by myself.

207
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:45,090
Wait, I feel like there's no... There doesn't seem to be, like, anything wrong.

208
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,310
There's no cooldown, so, like, look at my little dance.

209
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,570
Boom.

210
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,350
Get out of there.

211
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,770
This is my high ground.

212
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:53,590
What's your loot?

213
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:54,490
Oh, it's over here.

214
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,750
I'm pretty sure there's an easier way to put all of these together.

215
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,250
I'm, like, 100% sure, but, like...

216
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:00,530
Wait.

217
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,370
Okay.

218
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:02,790
Alright.

219
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,610
Oh, my God!

220
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,410
Okay, this is not good.

221
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,290
This is not good.

222
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,450
There's way too many people.

223
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,490
There is way... There is way...

224
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,950
Oh, this is not good.

225
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:12,930
This is not good.

226
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,810
I am going through a lot right now.

227
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:15,790
I am going through a lot.

228
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,670
I am going through a lot.

229
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,590
I am going through a lot.

230
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:21,290
I did not expect 200 skellies right here.

231
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,910
Like, I can't even dance.

232
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,230
Oh, my God!

233
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:24,550
No!

234
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:25,550
Oh, no.

235
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,250
Oh, no.

236
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,090
Oh, no.

237
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,870
Oh, no.

238
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:28,810
Oh, no.

239
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:29,990
Oh, no.

240
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,390
Why is there so many of them?

241
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,170
There's a dog!

242
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:34,250
No!

243
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,170
Where am I?

244
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:45,890
No!

245
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,420
Okay, okay.

246
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,720
This should be better now.

247
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:59,320
This should be a lot better now that I'm gonna get a team and they're gonna treat me right.

248
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,640
Wait, we don't fight.

249
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,260
I'll just do... I could just do solo.

250
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,920
Yeah, I don't want... I don't know if matchmaking is gonna be fast or anything.

251
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,520
We're gonna win this one.

252
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,140
I believe.

253
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,800
Can't go wrong this time.

254
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,700
I can't believe.

255
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,420
I got, like...

256
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,120
Everything was out to kill me.

257
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,100
I don't know.

258
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,100
Are you guys good people?

259
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,340
No, they were not good people.

260
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,320
That was...

261
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,080
Oh, okay.

262
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,340
Well, now I know that the...

263
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:22,940
Okay.

264
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,900
Okay, it's not so bad now.

265
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,560
It's not.

266
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,540
Oh, I forgot to bring heals.

267
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,000
Okay, it's pretty bad.

268
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,680
And I went straight in with...

269
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,300
No, okay.

270
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,140
It's pretty... Guys, it's pretty bad.

271
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,700
You know what?

272
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,520
My mission?

273
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,880
Get to the extraction point.

274
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,180
One golden mine.

275
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,140
It's not that far.

276
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,420
It's 600 meters away.

277
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,460
Alright, thank God I picked Hunter because it's like a gun and, like, I have aim.

278
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,940
Don't mind the fact that I just missed three shots there.

279
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:46,400
Come on.

280
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,740
Look how tiny his head is.

281
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,240
That's right.

282
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,240
Stand on it.

283
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,940
Oh my God, I'm gaming.

284
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,760
I actually game that so hard.

285
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,540
Where are you going?

286
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,340
It would be a shame if you get trapped.

287
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:12,860
Alright, now that I know that traps don't do anything to skeletons, I should have known because he's, like, literally a skeleton.

288
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,340
And what's gonna happen?

289
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,500
He just breaks off a piece of his bone.

290
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,520
Alright, here I go.

291
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,740
I'm beelining it.

292
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,700
Wait, is that person?

293
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,460
Oh my God, real person?

294
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,200
Oh my God, real person!

295
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,590
Oh, why are you lagging?!

296
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,020
Hunter!

297
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,480
What the fuck?!

298
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,880
Oh my God!

299
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:39,780
Bro!

300
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,700
Bro!

301
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,400
What?!

302
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,260
Oh my God!

303
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,260
Who are you?!

304
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:50,120
Never mind, maybe Hunter's not it.

305
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,200
What the?!

306
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,920
Okay, now I know Hunter is the warrior who was meta.

307
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,240
Wait, are they friends?

308
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,100
There's no way!

309
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,430
I swear to God, if he doesn't start punching each other...

310
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,360
Oh no, they're fighting each other.

311
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,580
Okay, thank God.

312
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,580
I was gonna be like, are you serious?

313
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,460
There's no way.

314
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,980
You better kill each other.

315
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,100
There's no freaking way.

316
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,220
Okay, this man literally just walked up to me and beat the shit out of me.

317
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,020
Well, now that I know what's meta.

318
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,300
Oh my God, look at them go!

319
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,080
That's right, you deserve to die.

320
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,900
Okay, I'm leaving.

321
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,920
Alright, alright, alright.

322
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,040
We're just gonna head straight to an extraction.

323
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:49,660
I'm not grabbing any loot, we're just going straight to extraction and then I win.

324
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,900
I call that a moral victory if I could get out of this town.

325
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,320
I'm a thousand kilometers?!

326
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,900
How am I from here to Hawaii?!

327
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,120
Editor, speed this up or speed up until I die.

328
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,320
I'm just running.

329
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,900
Do I still have fall damage or is it okay?

330
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,000
Maybe there is, but I'm just running really fast right now.

331
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,040
I learned, okay?

332
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,840
I learned that, you know, I was so confident.

333
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,740
I was so happy as a hunter.

334
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,520
I was like, oh man, hunter's fun.

335
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,140
It's like I have a gun.

336
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:33,800
And then I realized, back in the medieval times, being hunter doesn't mean...

337
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,740
Oh my God, I felt like a nerd.

338
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,720
At that point, being put in a locker.

339
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,600
Oh my God, and I'm getting chased right now.

340
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,920
He's gonna get tired, right?

341
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,700
All of these people are gonna get tired, right?

342
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,700
Right, guys?

343
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:50,660
Right?!

344
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,520
Oh my God, just aggro everything at this point.

345
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,180
I swear to God, if I... Oh, there's guys.

346
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,560
By the way, there's fall damage.

347
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,240
Editor, make sure to include the fact that I broke my ankle.

348
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,160
Oh my God, I made it!

349
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,820
I made it!

350
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,020
Oh my God!

351
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,320
Oh my God!

352
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,780
Oh my God!

353
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,740
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

354
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,420
I'm on HP!

355
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,940
I'm on HP!

356
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,350
I made it!

357
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,210
I made it!

358
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,890
Oh my God!

359
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,630
Oh my God, they're all warriors!

360
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,710
What was I doing?!

361
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,550
They're all warriors!

362
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,550
I was so foolish!

363
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,610
We did it!

364
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,310
We did it!

365
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:36,990
We won!

366
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,210
We won, everyone!

367
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,270
That's all I've got.

368
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:45,190
Getting out is a victory in my book.

369
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,150
Oh my God.

370
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:52,030
