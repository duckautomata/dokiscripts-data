00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,860
Hello, everybody.

2
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,040
It's time.

3
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,740
We're going straight in.

4
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,240
Whoa.

5
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:54,180
Okay.

6
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,460
What's this?

7
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,280
Half-Life 3?

8
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,420
On the PlayStation?

9
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,980
Exclusive by... Exclusive to the PlayStation?

10
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,620
What is this?

11
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,400
We're going straight in.

12
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,560
Straight into it.

13
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,660
Every time the sun dies, time stretches and tears.

14
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,340
See, the play does not wait for nobody.

15
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,780
There's no host here.

16
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,040
There's no what's his name.

17
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:18,340
name.

18
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,520
The Gamer Award host.

19
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,500
It's a stop bus.

20
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:28,810
Skyrim?

21
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,090
Skyrim on the PlayStation 6?

22
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,610
Scan for Sultari signals.

23
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:34,870
Signal corrupted.

24
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:35,750
Oh, yeah.

25
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,150
Jeff.

26
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:36,590
Yeah.

27
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,650
No, Jeff, to stop us.

28
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,770
To give us a five-hour intro before the trailer.

29
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,910
Confirmed.

30
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,250
You better stay out of my way.

31
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,090
Hey, everyone.

32
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:47,970
How's it going?

33
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,110
I'm Gregory Loudon.

34
00:02:49,370 --> 00:03:18,710
I was like, oh, my God, that Jeff how smart today we are thrilled to show off this first look of gameplay for saros running on ps5 saros builds on returnals award-winning action oh it's returnal and haunting story returnal was fun i actually like returnal of carcoso it's basically for those who never it was exclusive on um uh playstation but then you know like all excuses uh it comes on a pc like one year later

35
00:03:22,090 --> 00:04:20,030
um and it's actually really fun because it's basically like a shooter toho yeah i think i feel like if it was originally on the pc the game would have been a lot more popular like all exclusive games oh it's the volume two down okay i'll turn it down actually why am i turning down from here i'll turn it down oh yes you can now hit back hard using by holding the adaptive trigger on yeah it's a shooter roguelike toho it's very fun i really i remember really wanting to play it when it first came up but like getting uh getting like the rights to play the perms to play it was so hard so it never happened mark it on the map so i just played it off stream where you can learn more about lost

36
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:57,150
like getting perms back then for any PlayStation game requires like applying like one to two months in advance and it was for each session and like I and then like sometimes still sometimes we'll never even get the perms and I just gave up it was like an application too and so I was at that fuck this yeah and

37
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:25,870
like we couldn't monetize those streams too so i was just like applied months and events and i can't monetize like i'm like that's a lot of streams that i can't monetize that's this is second chance where you can be revived on first step to get straight back into the action but like that doesn't matter it doesn't matter we have fair use laws

38
00:05:38,530 --> 00:06:25,040
I'm a bit okay not gonna lie this being the first trailer isn't like making me very excited about you know usually it's like first trailer they they put like the second most hype game and then it's like second most hype game as first trailer then most hype game play we're looking forward to revealing more on our mysterious so i'm a little worried just a little bit just a little bit next year is when you'll be able to play saros on ps5 and enhance the ps5 thanks for watching we can't wait to share more from all of the team working on saros

39
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,870
oh my god you think you'll announce silk saw the playstation

40
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,830
It's a fun game.

41
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:57,270
I just I wish it was more popular It's sad that because it was a PlayStation exclusive And not on the PS5 It didn't get the popularity it deserved Because it is a very, it's a solid game

42
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:12,570
So I was like, so I was like This game does look good, not gonna lie Also, uh, sound guy I turned down the, I turned the volume a little bit Let me know if I should turn down the volume more

43
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,120
Uh, Luca, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

44
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:19,820
Thank you, thank you.

45
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,700
Fanny, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

46
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,080
Thank you, thank you.

47
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,120
Also, I will say Mega Bonds is a fucking dangerous game.

48
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,480
It's...

49
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,920
Did you know Mega Bonds was developed by one guy?

50
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,020
It's so dangerous.

51
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,180
I...

52
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:37,480
I...

53
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,640
I usually don't play solo games off stream.

54
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,540
But, like, it got me.

55
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,540
I went to bed at six in the morning because I was I spent like three hours on it.

56
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,220
I was about to head to bed.

57
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,540
I was like, you know, I'm going to do one more run.

58
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,780
And then three hours passed.

59
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,740
It was not one run.

60
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,960
It was not one run.

61
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,160
We'll do what we always do.

62
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,000
Throw more assets at the problem.

63
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,520
We have plenty more.

64
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,140
Bring it down a little bit more.

65
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,080
All right, sound guy, brought it down a little bit more.

66
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,040
Also, like, it's the final boss.

67
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,860
They're planning on nerfing the final boss.

68
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,980
This is actually the most bullshit thing I've ever...

69
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,780
What the fuck is going on?

70
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,640
Is this...

71
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,880
Does it just go Elysium?

72
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,460
Long range missiles get results.

73
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,020
I heard this game is...

74
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,000
Really good.

75
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,280
Um...

76
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,560
But like...

77
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,420
I think the funny thing is like...

78
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,260
People who have no idea what this Elysium is...

79
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,540
They'll start playing it.

80
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,140
Oh, it's not.

81
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,020
The Zero...

82
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,880
Zero...

83
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,360
Pair...

84
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,140
Pairdus?

85
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,680
Pairdus?

86
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,220
Oh, it is not the Scoliseum.

87
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:59,680
The people who don't really know what the Scoliseum is, they start playing it, and then, and then, like, they'll say some really crazy shit, and then they never, they don't continue it.

88
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,520
Because they don't...

89
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:08,860
Yeah, because apparently it's, like, extremely political, because they don't know exactly what it is.

90
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,600
So, like, when they get to that part, they just stop playing.

91
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,240
Uh, thanks.

92
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,120
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

93
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,440
Thank you.

94
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,220
Thank you.

95
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,400
Oh, it's Flight Simulator.

96
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,720
We have very good track record when it comes to fly.

97
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,240
Oh, shit.

98
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:44,620
Wait.

99
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,820
I can fucking fly with the zebras?

100
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,200
Wait, I wonder what happens if I, like, crash.

101
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,270
Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024.

102
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,510
Wait.

103
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:02,490
There's no...

104
00:10:02,510 --> 00:11:02,380
no way that's yeah i was gonna say there's no way a microsoft game is exclusive to the playstation i'll be like holy did they just buy xbox like did they find did they win did they finally won the war i was gonna be like oh my god they won the console wars imagine like microsoft flight simulators exclusive to the playstation three two execute the world as it's commonly known has crumbled alliance oh battlefield hey guys um i have a ea code i still forgot to tweet about how did i have an ea creator code guys it's toky bird if you want to pre-order battlefield and use my code.

105
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,020
I still forgot about it.

106
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,040
It just takes a little shake of perspective.

107
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:13,380
Oh,

108
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,000
the sound guy brought it down a little bit.

109
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,820
I know if I should adjust the volume again.

110
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,820
Where's the defib?

111
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,100

Oh, October.

114
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,820
Wait, that's so soon.

115
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,960
Now, let's celebrate so many good games coming out.

116
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,520
Within, like, the next couple of months is actually crazy.

117
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:21,440
I heard the reviews came in for Hades, too, and it's, like, nine and, or, like, tens to nines.

118
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,980
This PS5 remaster is a collaboration between Idos Montreal and Aspire.

119
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,540
The studio behind remastered classics like Tomb Raider and Soul Rebirth.

120
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,640
It sucks because I still need to finish silk sawing.

121
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,420
I really want to I really want to try Hades too.

122
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,320
But I have to finish Silk Song first.

123
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,640
I told myself, like, I'm doing one series a week.

124
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,460
Two series is just too much.

125
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,220
There's just so many good games.

126
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,920
There's so many good games coming up.

127
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,340
No two playthroughs unfold the same.

128
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,340
Deus Ex Remastered arrives on PS5 early next year.

129
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,780
I'll just wait for the PC version.

130
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,220
It's almost Halloween.

131
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,040
Wait for the PC.

132
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,420
I'm sorry.

133
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,780
But yeah.

134
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,740
I don't think the remastered is worth playing on the console.

135
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,200
Halloween the game?

136
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,080
Halloween the game?

137
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:30,140
The team at Ilphonic invites players to an asymmetrical horror sandbox where you can play as a civilian survivor.

138
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:30,800
Oh, it's Dead by Daylight.

139
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,580
But like...

140
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,640
But like...

141
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,320
But Halloween.

142
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,540
Or to hunt them down as Michael Myers.

143
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,700
He possesses unique abilities.

144
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,060
It's literally, it's dead by daylight formula.

145
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:44,780
I'm pretty sure.

146
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,640
It's like the chainsaw massacre.

147
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:48,960
It's Friday at 13.

148
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,040
Yeah, it's Friday at 13.

149
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,520
That's like these games are really fun.

150
00:13:53,800 --> 00:14:01,540
But like, people like just don't have enough friends to make it to keep it alive.

151
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,660
Oh my god, it's literally Friday at 13.

152
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,840
It's actually Friday the 13th.

153
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,120
Protect his victims when Halloween the game launches on September 8th, 2027.

154
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,720
It's the same animation.

155
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,560
Wait, it's actually just...

156
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,640
It's just a reskin of Friday the 13th.

157
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,820
Friday the 13th.

158
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,600
First, their hit action RPG, last epoch.

159
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,060
But we're in the suburbia instead of the camp.

160
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,400
This celebrated dungeon crawler.

161
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,400
Yeah, they're gonna lose their rights in one year.

162
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,200
Yeah, I think they reskinned it.

163
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,540
It actually has the same animation.

164
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,020
I better be able to...

165
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,720
I better be able to...

166
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,100
The Katy Perry dance.

167
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,190
California girls.

168
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:57,050
I better not be able to do...

169
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,690
They better reskin that too.

170
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:07,010
The last epoch's first major expansion, Orobus, will arrive at the same time as the upcoming PS5 release.

171
00:15:07,050 --> 00:16:34,540
I love the Also, I love Whenever, okay, I think it was Kony And he was like Dead by Daylight is just tag And like, everything clicked for me I was like, that's why I don't like Dead by Day It's just It's just tag It's just spooky tag And play an original story You can experience only in the game Capture a creature go fishing apparently there's like okay I don't understand like isn't the objective as the killer to kill all the survivors because apparently being killer right now is miserable because you have to do like this little like inside like there's little like rule thing with the survivors where you have to let them survive a little like long enough then you can kill them because the survivors will get yeah they're fucking made up rules and then um january 28th yeah no they were yeah apparently then the game devs were like okay if you kill the survivors too early we're gonna give you a warning i'm like what isn't that the point of the game like for them to not survive and then

172
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:42,880
like you know there was like backlash about it but then get mad if you like don't let them live a little longer.

173
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,260
Oh my God, Mega Man!

174
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,720
Proto Man!

175
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,820
Oh my God, Sonic Racing has everything.

176
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,700
Familiar sights and sounds will take players back to some of Mega Man's most memorable adventures.

177
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,820
Cause like survivors will actually like rage quit or like slur at you if you like kill them too early.

178
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:10,640
And I'm like, but the game is all, if you are a killer, You're supposed to kill!

179
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,760
I don't understand!

180
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,540
What's the point of being?

181
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,920
What's the fun of it?

182
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:15,900
You can't kill.

183
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,600
Like...

184
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,910
I don't understand.

185
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,320
Including a release date for Neo 3.

186
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,900
If kill...

187
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,720
If killer...

188
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,680
Why no kill?

189
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,940
Who will be Shogun?

190
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,840
Kure Matsu.

191
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,440
Why?

192
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,320
What's this?

193
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,720
You never understand what it means!

194
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,420
Is this Onimusha?

195
00:17:38,900 --> 00:18:11,120
I am Himiko on my honor as a samurai warrior Neo 3 There's so many samurai type games I feel like I could name like 5 That that's come That's a sequel that's coming out There's so many samurai sequels coming out Like this year and next year So it's hard to figure out which samurai game it is To rule One must prove their might.

196
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,060
Guys, thank you for the tier one song.

197
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,220
Thank you, thank you.

198
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,340
Oh, Japanese silk song.

199
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,360
There's actually so many.

200
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:26,220
Like Neo, Neo, Samurai Warriors, Onimushu.

201
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:32,820
And what was the ghost of Yotai?

202
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:33,640
Yotai?

203
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,860
And they're all like sequels coming out.

204
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,460
Neo.

205
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,100
I always wanted to play Neo.

206
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,200
That's also a very long series too.

207
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,300
There's so many series.

208
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,120
Dynasty Warriors!

209
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:00,720
Yay!

210
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,020
This was worth it.

211
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,440
This was worth it.

212
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,820
This state of play was worth it.

213
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,620
Oh my god!

214
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,840
Is this a remaster of the best Dynasty Warriors game?

215
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,100
Oh my god!

216
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,200
That's classic Talion!

217
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,380
Oh my god, this is a remaster!

218
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:18,920
Oh!

219
00:19:20,780 --> 00:20:00,580
have okay it was worth it the state of it's state of play this is actually the one of the better best versions my my manager please say oh my god it's just like please play this no no okay dynasty warriors 3 is not that long okay it's not a very long game it's actually very short compared to like the other dynasty warriors games from existence unless i decide to play each character

220
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:13,300
because each character has its own story so unless i decide to do each character for its own story our current world

221
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,280
What's Code Vain?

222
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,760
The tampering with history is strictly forbidden.

223
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,540
Is it...

224
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,720
Oh, it's anime, Dark Souls.

225
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,940
Oh, yeah, I remember.

226
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,420
We remember they...

227
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,020
I...

228
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,940
It's the same thing I asked last time.

229
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,580
I remember now.

230
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,560
I asked this before last time, too.

231
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:02,390
Today you'll pay your dues!

232
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,120
Boom, boom, boom!

233
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,300
Boom, boom, boom!

234
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,480
Boom, boom!

235
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,940
The music is pretty hype.

236
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,280
Code Fane.

237
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,530
I wonder if there's going to be any...

238
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,590
Uh, any like...

239
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:37,490
Back in June, we debuted Final Fantasy XI's exclusive first looks.

240
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,550
Right here on State of Play.

241
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,250
The Dynasty Warriors one was pretty hyped though.

242
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,670
That one actually made me so happy.

243
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,990
I think like 3 and 4 were the best.

244
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:48,450
Was it 3?

245
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,710
3 was one of the best ones.

246
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:55,950
There was one where I really liked where each character has its own story.

247
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:56,130
Okay.

248
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:13,110
We'll be fucked up if I just like watch something else.

249
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,750
I was like, oh, Final Fantasy Tactics?

250
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,710
Alright, let's watch something.

251
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,590
Don't you dare.

252
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:33,970
Let's do a quick run on MegaBug while they talk about file fantasy tactics.

253
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,910
I see your words for what they are.

254
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,990
Skip ad!

255
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:51,450
Come on, thank you for your one sub, thank you!

256
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:53,450
Yay!

257
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:04,310
You see, it has to work tactics and then my brain turns off.

258
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,110
What the fuck?

259
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:14,250
What the fuck is this?

260
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:21,170
Uncle Def and Shin Hida Yuki.

261
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:25,670
Let it die?

262
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,530
What's let it die?

263
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,250
What's let it die?

264
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:44,930
This game is a extraction shooter.

265
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:59,830
It's an extraction shooter.

266
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,890
Yeah, it's extraction melee.

267
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:08,770
I just, I just, I can't.

268
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,210
I, I don't know.

269
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:15,030
Extraction, anything related to extraction is just...

270
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:23,910
I think it's just the losing your material stuff that messes with me.

271
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:28,370
Because I'm like, if I never play, I never lose my stuff.

272
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:29,870
Nope.

273
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:36,030
If I never play, I'll never lose it.

274
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,710
Just don't die.

275
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,070
It's the easiest way to never die.

276
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,190
I mean, it looks really fun.

277
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,510
Let it die, Inferno.

278
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:52,650
It looks fun.

279
00:24:53,370 --> 00:25:00,690
It's just hard because Tarkov just has such a grip on the extraction shooter genre.

280
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:05,030
that's, like, been able to compete against it.

281
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:16,450
They have just a, like, they just have it in their fucking hand and they're like, I'm never letting you go.

282
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,240
Like, you can never leave me.

283
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,260
Oh, it looks pretty.

284
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,960
I feel like, okay, it looks really pretty, but also, like, it's so hard to see.

285
00:25:49,140 --> 00:26:01,440
I think, like, judge, looking at this, it looks incredibly hard to see because there's just so many lines.

286
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,360
Yeah, I think it's very unique, but I can't see anything, too.

287
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:19,980
You know what?

288
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,260
It's like, yeah, visual clutter.

289
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,160
Yeah, I was going to say it.

290
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,240
It's just so cluttered.

291
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:30,920
And, like, I guess, like, because he's red, he's red, so then that's like a way to defend differentiate from the rest of the background.

292
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,180
But even then, that's so much visual.

293
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:37,440
.

294
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,480
.

295
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,820
.

296
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,160
.

297
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,680
.

298
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,940
.

299
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,060
.

300
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,180
.

301
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:45,300
.

302
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,920
.

303
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,180
.

304
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,140
I think so.

305
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,080
It looks like a platform in Metrovania.

306
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:02,820
The endless.

307
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,320
I mean, it says endless.

308
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,080
All right, pa-pa-pa-pa.

309
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,440
Citizens of Pi-well.

310
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,480
Today, three more minutes of trailers.

311
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:19,000
... by our own hand.

312
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,120
...

313
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:24,280
We fight those who wield power to prey on the weak.

314
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,200
Beasts who think themselves men.

315
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,280
That is what it means to be a Greymane.

316
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,280
What's Crimson Desert?

317
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,940
The time has come to do what we believe to be right.

318
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,020
Yeah, they said it's only 30 minutes, right?

319
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,320
Seek out your Greymane comrades.

320
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,600
Wait, is that John Snow?

321
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,960
It looks like him.

322
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,060
And let your heart speak without fear.

323
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,640
Single player Black Desert.

324
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,480
I know Black Desert was really, is really, is a really popular memo.

325
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,140
We fight for the future of all.

326
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,640
Surround the horde of our final battle.

327
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,950
It looks really good.

328
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:09,970
Oh shit.

329
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:17,450
Your fight is not for revenge, nor glory, nor pride.

330
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,530
Oh my god, there's mechas!

331
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:26,350
Just a random mecha floating in medieval, like medieval times.

332
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:35,080
Why the fuck would I get a mecha if I have a fucking dragon?

333
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,660
Dragon's just freaking bloat.

334
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,320
Like, it can fly faster than whatever the fuck that was.

335
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,040
The ye old mecha.

336
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,040
A dragon can just melt the mecha.

337
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,700
In desktop.

338
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,360
Pulse elevate.

339
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,920

It's almost like in town, I was like, wait, I thought it was a PS5.

343
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,380

345
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:34,800

Bloodboard?

Oh.

376
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:24,720
This is not their most iconic.

377
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,260
I was like, what?

378
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,980

Stop bloodboard chart.

382
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:53,060
Most iconic immediately card slot.

383
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,640
There's no way they're ending this on cars.

384
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,420
There's no way.

385
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,180
100 million units sold?

386
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,400
People really fucking love cars, man.

387
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,220
Oh, thank God.

388
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:42,280
I was going to say, I swear to God, if they end on cars, I swear to God.

389
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,380
Oh, they just end on a controller.

390
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,240
I mean, that's...

391
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,820
I don't know if that's equally as disappointing

392
00:33:54,860 --> 00:34:14,100
more yeah they end on a controller actually no i take it back i wish they ended on cars i wish they ended on cars oh thank god thank fucking god that might have been worse what longer than i can remember

393
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:36,640
I'd like to say I'm not a violent man Okay, how short is he, though?

394
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,320
Is he, if he's short, then like they know what they're doing

395
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:59,040
He's supposed to be like, what, 5 foot 4 or some shit He better be like 5 foot 2 He better be tiny He better be the shortest one in this game I'm sorry, Sony

396
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:09,960
you short king the original short king that's always waiting just

397
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:23,680
not for me oh my god it looks so good i mean it's by insomniac so like it better be good i want to play the spider-man game so badly

398
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:34,510
if he's over five foot two not my oh my god no hero mystique

399
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:57,320
oh my god it looks so good thank god they actually ended it with a real game thank fucking god i was gonna be like i i swear to god this this state of play ends with a goddamn god a word controller i

400
00:36:01,610 --> 00:37:02,430
the question that comes up to us at zombie games is are you going to make a wolverine game that is as violent as visceral as the character in the comics I think it I mean spider-man was a a PlayStation exclusive effort so I won't be surprised working with Wolverine is interesting because people have been talking about this game for so long because they're like is it actually gonna come out narrator he has gaps in his memory so Wolverine doesn't really remember a lot of his life and that's got to be an experience it has to be because like the spider-man one was all of rage and fury but that was exclusive time and he could be very very kind and tender i feel like this entire state of play it was just to hype this they were like we finally finished the trailer they're like all right we got okay stand play tomorrow i feel like that was basically like all right we need to find things to pass the we need to find some stuff to pass the state of play to announce wolverine i feel like that's

401
00:37:02,430 --> 00:38:05,550
basically it like because like everything else was like what the and then wolverine with something samiak ourselves we all agreed he's the one we don't need to see anybody else hey i'm leon mcintyre and i play james logan howlett in marvel's wolverine that that's not bad that one sort of works oh my god he sounds sort of like who he is oh what's his name try and find the essence of who wolverine is he sort of sounds like it yeah he sounds like you yeah people take from him people betray him he still fights for people who can't fight themselves you yeah he sounds like you jackman life one of the biggest responsibilities i've ever had and one of the coolest things i've ever got to do the entire game is built around staying true to the wolverine experience and then how do we want to put our insomniac stamp on that how do we want to put our own spin and creativity but still give something new and fresh that fans are going to be excited about it's the full package it is a level of detail

402
00:38:05,550 --> 00:39:07,850
that we've never been able to do before jesus it's so gory you can see pours you can see blood in between the little lines of his teeth i love the attention to detail it's exciting that we're going to be able to bring that kind of fidelity to players it's so boring invited goes to many places but like that's basically wolverine he's literally like slashing you with his fucking does sliding down that rooftop and you can see that looks so good and low town it's always nice teasing the depth and the amount of characters that we'll be seeing there and there are some hints to other characters that fans of wolverine will recognize for sure like i swear to god if there's no way they don't include saber too blood he's literally like his rival pretty phenomenal there's a part in the trailer where logan jumps down and then he does the claws up through the face that one i thought maybe was going to be taking it too far but i am so glad that we have it it looks fantastic wolverine's combat making

403
00:39:07,850 --> 00:40:04,810
that special making that feel like him making it feel different to anything else you've played that's a tough job what's so cool for me is there was this one section would you say they're marvel rival so incredibly satisfying i was like this is gonna be amazing we're pretty excited about the artwork that we're using on the cover it's dynamic it's rough edged you notice it doesn't look like our past games it has a sense of urgency and forward movement and rage and fury and that's wolverine yeah i i'm like i don't think peter parker could do any of that i ever worked with make you feel part of their team that's not something you always get we've been in a creative collaboration with insomniac games and playstation for over a decade now we've made some of the greatest superhero games of all time and that was always the goal we made some greatest superhero games all time Spider-Man.

404
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:08,030
I mean, one game.

405
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:11,470
All Spider-Man.

406
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:17,970
On behalf of everyone at Insomniac Games and the Wolverine team especially, we want to thank you for taking time to watch our trip.

407
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,110
And Spider-Man 2.

408
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:22,210
Spring of 2026.

409
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:25,350
One game three times.

410
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,950
And they are right.

411
00:40:41,550 --> 00:41:02,850
the fact that it's like a year i swear i i feel like they like finished the trailer and then literally sony was just like say to play tomorrow i don't care what you padded with we have to announce a state of play like this is our end our end trailer

412
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:14,110
Like, all the other games, other than Dynasty Warriors 3, was like, why are we watching this?

413
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:27,060
Because, like, a lot of these games have already been announced before.

414
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:36,820
Like, we know, like, I feel like 70% of these games that's being shown have been shown already in previous state of plays.

415
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,620
So I was just like, wait, what?

416
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,280
Again?

417
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,460
That was fun.

418
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,640
That was like, okay.

419
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,540
Like the last trailer actually like fucking saved the entire state.

420
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:56,400
That last trailer and Dynasty Warriors 3 saved the entire state of play.

421
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:03,520
Because I remember everyone was like talking about like, oh, do you think the Wolverine project is still going to be a thing?

422
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:07,260
Because like there was like no news about it for so long.

423
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:12,600
There's been no news about the Wolverine game.

424
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:44,560
in a very long time so people were like wait are they like still gonna be doing it or is it not cancelled and then bam there it is finally it's no longer rumors we're finally we're finally getting wolverine uh yeah like people fly was cancelled too so they're like nope it's not cancelled just gotta wait a year here it is um but yeah no i think i'm really looking for forward to the new Wolverine game.

425
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:48,140
I have always wanted to play the Spider-Man game for a while now.

426
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:54,160
I just, you know, like I said, there's just so many games to play and I'm always like, okay, I'll play this and I'll play that and I'll play this.

427
00:42:54,380 --> 00:43:02,400
So I'm bouncing around between a lot of game series, but definitely would love to do Spider-Man before Wolverine comes out.

428
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:08,460
Oh yeah, the Wonder Woman game too that I think like officially got canceled.

429
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:25,200
I remember reading, I'm not sure if that's also, uh, rumors, but I heard, uh, I heard the Wonder Woman game got officially canceled, so, um, not 100% sure, but I read about it, uh, which is very unfortunate.

430
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:33,840
Uh, I feel like DC doesn't have, I mean, yeah, DC doesn't have any good games other than, What was it?

431
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:40,780
What was the fighting game that they did?

432
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,900
I forgot what it was called, but other than that.

433
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,880
And Batman, Arkham Knight, yeah.

434
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,700
Other than Arkham, yeah.

435
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:47,540
Injustice.

436
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,320
It's Injustice and Arkham that they really have.

437
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:54,400
Now all they have is like that phone game trip.

438
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:02,880
Like that weird ass DC phone game that keeps fucking playing those like fake YouTube.

439
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:29,180
I don't know I don't even know what game it is It's like a civilization simulator thing And that was like the only DC game Yeah the ad game Yeah that's like the only DC game That's currently out recently right now And like all the other I remember they made this Arkham Knights Is that what it's called?

440
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:34,200
There was one with the Robins and stuff That they try to do But I also failed.

441
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:41,840
I feel like it's because they always all try to do like this weird-ass like open world, like open world game.

442
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,640
But like it's not really that open.

443
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:44,820
Oh, Gotham Knights.

444
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,400
Yeah, I heard that Gotham Knights was pretty bad.

445
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:53,080
And there was also Suicide Squad where they like killed off all the Justice League.

446
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:55,240
And then everyone got really mad.

447
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:59,740
And then and then they're like, Tiki, JK, they weren't actually dead dead.

448
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,740
Those were their clones.

449
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:02,780
But people were like.

450
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,420
Hmm.

451
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,040
You're like, hmm.

452
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:11,820
Yeah.

453
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,180
Okay, buddy.

454
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,600
Sure it was.

455
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,160
Except, yeah, everyone's actually still alive.

456
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:23,940
We just killed off the clothes.

457
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,840
I'm like, wait, what about Wonder Woman?

458
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:26,780
Didn't she die?

459
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,080
So she died for nothing?

460
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:32,680
Like, I'm just thinking, wait, so Wonder Woman died for nothing?

461
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:50,540
Like, people were like, okay, they had to have Done, they, like, Literally, like, done a Patch, live, live patch Fix of it, because I think originally They were meant to They were meant to be Dead, dead, but then the backlash Was so bad that they were like,

462
00:45:50,600 --> 00:46:33,060
okay, we gotta Fix this, alright, JK, they're all Clones, every one of them, but Not Wonder Woman, we don't care about that, every one Of them were clones, and then, like, Cause, like, they made, like, instead of, like, an actual cutscene of it they like drew like it was just still images of the story they're like they just drew the pictures they just illustrated it i'm like wait okay so if this was planned why the fuck does it not have an animated cutscene like why is it just like screenshots i yeah it was like a slideshow i was like wait then why didn't you have an actual animated cutscene if Like,

463
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:34,300
it was planned.

464
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,360
Yeah, it was like slideshow and text.

465
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,040
And then they don't address the fact that Wonder Woman died.

466
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,640
They're like, everyone was clowns.

467
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:53,140
The Justice League had no female member.

468
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,080
I was just like, what?

469
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:00,680
There's never been a female member in the Justice League.

470
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,480
Everyone else was...

471
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:07,640
It's all just been Batman, Superman, Green Lantern, Flash.

472
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:08,760
That's it.

473
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:09,580
An Aquaman.

474
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:10,680
That's it.

475
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:18,060
There was no woman, wonder who?

476
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,980
There was no wonder woman.

477
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,400
Wonder who?

478
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,020
Yeah, that's crazy.

479
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,040
I was like, what the fuck?

480
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,720
But yeah, I was surprised.

481
00:47:32,740 --> 00:48:28,540
of that game because like i think um i think the worst part about it honestly with suicide squad is how they handled batman because like um it was like the batman voice actors like not his last role but like one of his last roles and everyone was so excited because you know it was supposed to be like um a sequel to the arkham series and then they're like what the they're like they didn't oh my god they did it too dirty yeah i didn't that so i it wasn't his last role as batman it wasn't kevin conroy's last role as batman it was like like his second or third last role um yeah i think his second last role as batman and people got real i i look you got like i feel like like they in hindsight they should have like i don't know delay the game a little bit and fix that

482
00:48:31,720 --> 00:49:40,100
like i was just like thinking like oh my god they should put that in development health it's very i i think it's a little yeah it was definitely a little insulting um yeah it's such a terrible standoff to um a beloved like voice actors and like the character the batman character um anyway guys uh that was a fun watch along i hope you guys enjoyed i do have another stream and i have to prep for it because it is a sponsor stream um but uh uh you can uh if you guys like to watch more of me you're new here my name is joki bay i usually stream on youtube and actually have another stream in two hours uh on youtube for nikki so please check me out over there um if you like my content um you want to know whenever i stream on twitch please follow me on twitter because i usually tweet out whenever i stream on twitch um you want to support me via other means please feel free to check out uh all my merch stuff so merchandise helps a lot my doki merch my collab with gina draws ends today so you
