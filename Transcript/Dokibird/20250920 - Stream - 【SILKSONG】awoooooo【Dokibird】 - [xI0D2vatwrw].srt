1
00:01:47,110 --> 00:02:43,630
Oh good Friday I was debating if I should grab coffee or not but let's just do it raw fuck it let's oh we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna do no caffeine and we're doing it live live I'm so tired oh my god I'm so tired um we're raw dogging this no kaffy do you know that's what the gen z people use that term now that's crazy uh they actually they that's actually what they use that term now they're like they're like we're gonna raw dog this flight by not watching any entertainment whatsoever yeah no i'm for real you know where i learned that from sunny in philadelphia and i was like no that can't be real.

2
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,230
Sunny Philadelphia is always, it's satire.

3
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,170
You're just satiring, right?

4
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,650
And I looked it up.

5
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:56,390
I looked it up and the Gen Zers, like, claimed the word.

6
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,970
They've reclaimed raw dogging.

7
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:15,770
It's now a different definition to them, Apparently I gotta stay hip with the kids guys.

8
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:18,720
I gotta I gotta stay hip with the kids

9
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,710
They've claimed it back

10
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:49,450
But yeah, there's the new definition for it is basically it but it's basically when you go through something without any other For like you have to sit through stuff with no like with like just nothing I just, yes, got pushed through it.

11
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:53,810
They got pushed through it with nothing, nothing else to help them.

12
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:54,950
But that's the new.

13
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,510
So they digged it.

14
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,190
It's all raw.

15
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,510
All right, let's boot up.

16
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,510
Silk song.

17
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,730
Oh, today, I'm sorry for starting late today.

18
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:09,470
I don't know why.

19
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,730
I never said alarms up.

20
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,950
I've never said alarms up.

21
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:41,870
I'm sorry, I'm just I'm just eepey I'm playing eepey for 1230 streams because usually I just wake up I just somehow wake up and it's and it's like an hour before streaming and like I'm like that's okay also yes dad did not wake me up because I'm using this new strategy where I just closed the door

22
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,790
It's so innovative, but it's working.

23
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,170
I don't hear him.

24
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,990
I don't hear him.

25
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,110
It's fucking muffled.

26
00:04:53,510 --> 00:05:00,670
I don't let him in the bed anymore, but all I do is, I know this is a, you guys could try this out too for your dogs or cats.

27
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:01,790
You guys should really try it out.

28
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,070
It's actually crazy.

29
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,490
You just close the door.

30
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,170
And then you could sleep more.

31
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,150
Oh my God.

32
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,830
Does that blow your mind?

33
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:19,810
What a fucking crazy concept, revolutionary for our time.

34
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,450
But yes, I didn't wake up.

35
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:29,190
I didn't wake up from my dad alarm just because I did that because the sparks are like really muffled.

36
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,110
So I sleep through it.

37
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:39,490
But I was like, you know when you're sleeping and you just keep dreaming and dreaming and dreaming, like that's basically what today's sleep was for me.

38
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:45,050
And like it was just such a heavy dream that you just don't wake up from it until like, you know, I don't know.

39
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,090
my brain was like, wait a minute, don't you have a stream?

40
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,890
And then like, okay, wake up, wake up.

41
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,150
And then I wake, I was like, holy shit, 1220, uh-uh.

42
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,070
I literally woke up at 1220.

43
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,190
That was how, that was pretty, that was how bad it was.

44
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:06,230
Um, so, um, I didn't, I, I felt like, like, I don't know how much I slept.

45
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,590
I don't remember what time I went to bed, which is pretty bad if you don't remember what time.

46
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,330
Maybe it was pretty.

47
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,510
I know it wasn't after four.

48
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:18,410
I know it was Because when I went to bed, I was like, at least it's not at 4 a.m.

49
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,330
Like, that's what I was thinking.

50
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,370
So I know that.

51
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,030
I just don't remember what time I went to bed.

52
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,350
But anyway, let's boot up.

53
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:27,970
Gog.

54
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,050
Yay, Gog.

55
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,850
Where the fuck is my...

56
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:34,570
Oh, my gosh.

57
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:40,170
I will say God's UI is pretty ugly.

58
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:40,990
I will...

59
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,870
Sorry.

60
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,130
I'm not a fan.

00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:20,150
let's just put it on silk sock.

63
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,770
By the way, I did farm.

64
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:27,450
I farmed groceries off stream because we're not going to.

65
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,530
I'm not going to make you guys sit through.

66
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:40,450
Oh, wait, why is my sit through another 30 minutes of me farming the fucking goddamn money in the super Catholicistic world.

67
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,350
We are not doing that.

68
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:53,150
I did farm I did beat up some some paladins for this so we now have two thousand dollars

69
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:04,610
We weren't getting any handouts, so I had to beat up some paladins We're not gonna talk to the racist grandpa.

70
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:17,010
All right, let's go buy some stuff That's right the duchess got bank All right, let's grab the mask We need that.

71
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,390
I know it's not much, but I swear to God, I cannot keep farming.

72
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,710
I was going crazy.

73
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:26,990
All right.

74
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,050
I don't believe any of these are...

75
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,570
Okay, we'll grab the simple key, because I feel like you guys are going to yell at me to buy that.

76
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,370
So we'll buy the simple key.

77
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:37,690
Guys, okay.

78
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,590
All right, I'll talk to you one time, Grandpa.

79
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,130
I heard you did some saving for a dear merchant.

80
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:45,630
there.

81
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,670
I've seen her about.

82
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:52,030
Sneaking and scrounging, even before he was ringing that bell.

83
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,850
She's a useful sort.

84
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,490
But don't let her age be fooling.

85
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,350
She's still the sharpest mind for a deal.

86
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:06,410
Won't be long till there's nary a rosary about this shrine, letting it found its way into her pockets.

87
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,010
Okay, that's all you wanted to...

88
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,970
Was that really that important?

Break the cogwheel above the door?

106
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,040
What, this?

107
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,980
That's right.

108
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,500
Oh, maybe I'm gonna open it and then I break it.

109
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,640
That's right, this is a free economy!

110
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,260
Freedom for all!

111
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:51,380
Let anyone spend, oh wait, maybe I'll, maybe I've killed them all.

112
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,340
Who knows?

113
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,880
Now, yeah, I think I might have killed them all.

114
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:04,120
It's like, I break open, it's a zombie apocalypse, and I literally break open the door for the zombies to come in.

115
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:04,700
Oh well.

116
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,730
Now we'll never know.

117
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:14,350
You can save, oh well, nothing I can do.

118
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,350
Lack of security and hazard.

119
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,810
Oh, if only I could do something.

120
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,150
I wonder who did that.

121
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,720
I mean, now.

122
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,180
Now he can't lock it up for the rich.

123
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,580
Anyone is welcome now.

124
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,520
Should not have been greedy exactly.

125
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,400
Wait, where?

126
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,400
Is it here?

127
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,980
No, it's down here.

128
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,500
What's done is done.

129
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,180
No regrets.

130
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,880
Shouldn't have charged me money.

131
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,120
And that door would have been what still worked.

132
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:00,580
Alright.

133
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:02,820
Alright.

Where do we go now?

136
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,620
Wait, we should get rid of that.

137
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,280
Alright.

138
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,020
Where do we go now?

139
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,880
I think I spent all my money on everything.

140
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,500

Warm yourself by my lantern while I call.

158
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,820
Barloom is a land of harsh extremes.

159
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:13,040
Perhaps that is in part why the pilgrims have a culture of testing themselves against it so fervently.

160
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:20,000
Perhaps when I first encountered them, I had little respect for the weak rag-bungled bugs.

161
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,420
Too cowardly to even carry a weapon, because they're religious!

162
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:33,680
But Don Daku sometimes rejudged too quickly, and they're all about them until there's no more peace or love.

163
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,540
There is a self-strength to them.

164
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,440
Though it's difficult for me to truly understand it.

165
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,480
Alright, we need to grab the mountain map.

166
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,840
I mean, we don't really need any of these.

167
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,500
Alright, here we go.

168
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,320
Alright, no pants time.

169
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,420
Whoops.

170
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,660
Okay, I need to warm up.

171
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,380
I messed up.

172
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,660
Need to use...

173
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,420
Oh my god, wait.

174
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,800
What happens if I break it?

175
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,600
Oh, who would have thought?

176
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,340
Guys, if you break it, it breaks.

177
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,460
What a unique concept.

178
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,220
How is I supposed to know?

179
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,860
That would happen.

180
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,040
No way.

181
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,280
Oh, shit.

182
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,540
Okay.

183
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,100
How is I supposed to know?

184
00:18:33,120 --> 00:19:00,420
to know guys how there was no warning whatsoever oh this is bad this is so bad I think that was supposed to warm me up oh my god I think I think that flower was supposed to warm me up.

185
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:06,760
Okay.

186
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,300
Oh, I have to go higher.

187
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:14,420
Oh, wait.

188
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,560
Do I have a bench?

189
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,880
Where's the bench?

190
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:17,700
Oh, my God.

191
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,600
There was a bench.

192
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,180
Oh, my God.

193
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,480
I didn't realize that was a chair.

194
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,740
It's just a rock.

195
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,400
If any rock could just be a bench.

196
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,620
Why can't I just make my own bench?

197
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:31,900
I'll go this way.

198
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,320
Oh, what the fuck?

199
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,180
I thought she was like, nice.

200
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,860
Then why don't I just bring my own blanket?

201
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,500
Please, can I buy your blanket?

202
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,160
I can make any rock into a chair, apparently.

203
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,620
Because you're not Shakira.

204
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,540
Oh my god, I'm confused.

205
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,740
I hate this.

206
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,920
I hate this area already.

207
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,880
Okay, what's over here?

208
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,840
Oh my god, I can't even, like, wait and see.

209
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,360
Oh, wait, there's another chair.

210
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:19,680
Oh, wait.

211
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,480
It's not a chair.

212
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,820
It has a chair-shaped!

213
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:30,960
Sister spider, if seeking commune with a creature atop this mountain, take the climb above us to test a challenge beyond even our setting.

214
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:37,900
Upon that summit gained, and creature held, no one shall chose what gift to grant, what death as likely as insight.

215
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,740
Is that it?

216
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,320
Oh my god, that is literally just so.

217
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,980
I wish I could just break this item.

218
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,960
JR, thank you for the super chat.

219
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:48,960
Thank you, thank you.

220
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,180
Is it too late to say happy birthday?

221
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,620
My birthday is exactly 12 months ago.

222
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,800
Anyway, thank you for the infectious laughter and awesome opportunities like Donkey Jam.

223
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,560
26 isn't old, right?

224
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,360
Wait, you're like halfway through the grave right now.

225
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,120
But don't worry, it's not that...

226
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:37,440
joking guys but happy but late at 12 months a birthday i'm sorry but you don't get a birthday song you that's your little bit just a little oh man if you were one day earlier but for 11 months and 30 days then then you then you would have made it oh it was just unfortunate wait can i do that area?

227
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,950
I don't think I can, right?

228
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:58,530
I feel like I'm gonna die.

229
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:02,810
Oh god, there it is.

230
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:03,390
Okay.

231
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:06,630
Alright.

232
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,310
I sent JK!

233
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,050
It's just...

234
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,820
Oh my god.

235
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,360
This is so cruel.

236
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:29,950
okay

237
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:43,020
oh my god where are the lights oh there's the lights okay there's the lights alright where am I and also where am I

238
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:52,530
alright this way oh nice we actually needed that oh my god we needed that so much

239
00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:01,770
I don't am I I can't make that, right?

240
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:06,150
That's not, I can't make that, right?

241
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:09,170
Oh my god, the moment I set one foot out.

242
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,210
The moment I set one foot out.

243
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:16,690
What's that, what's that disease that you get?

244
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,890
If you're out too long, they have to cut your leg.

245
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,230
Frostbite.

246
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,610
One foot out and I get frostbite.

247
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,210
Cut my leg.

248
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:30,730
You gotta cut my toes now.

249
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:36,690
One small move in its frostbite type.

250
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,210
I think...

251
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,990
Am I going the wrong way?

252
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:43,970
Oh, no.

253
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,000
Oh, it's to my right.

254
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:56,140
There was something to my right, but I didn't really know what it was.

255
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:02,760
Oh, wait.

256
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,260
Is that...

257
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:04,960
No, no.

258
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:05,340
Oh.

259
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:12,200
I was like, are you, are you like a little laser pointer?

260
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,240
And then he fucking destroys my entire light source?

261
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,380
I was like, oh yeah, no, not a good guy.

262
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,860
I was like, look, there's a laser pointer.

263
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,680
It's here to lead me, right?

264
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,320
Oh shit, I, guys, I don't know.

265
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,520
I, I, I'm dead.

266
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,380
No!

267
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,480
Oh, no!

268
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,980
It's so far!

269
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,300
I swam so... Why did I swim farther?

270
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:47,900
Wait.

271
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:48,940
Okay.

272
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:50,580
Um...

273
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,140
Okay, that's a little awkward.

274
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,980
I might have to... I might have to eat the thing.

275
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,020
Why did you go?

276
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,960
I don't know.

277
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,160
I don't know.

278
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,280
I don't know why I kept swimming further.

279
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,060
We gotta eat this.

280
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,440
All right, we gotta eat this.

281
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,480
That's a little awkward, guys.

282
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,340
I don't know what came over me.

283
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,640
I was just like, what if I just keep swimming?

284
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,400
What if...

285
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:32,300
My head was just like, he, he.

286
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,900
Oh my god, I've messed that up.

287
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,180
Maybe the solution is to be further away from...

288
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,940
land what

289
00:25:47,380 --> 00:26:17,720
a unique concept don't you think okay there you go just keep swimming yeah you know when they you know I was just listening to you know when they're like just keep swimming I thought I could just keep swimming did they lie to me am I not supposed to keep swimming oh yeah I'll keep going.

290
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,220
That's not how that works.

291
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,560
And what's the point?

292
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,020
If I can't just keep swimming!

293
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,120
Yeah, there's like this.

294
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,700
Oh, that's just like a little...

295
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,460
Oh, whoop.

296
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,900
A little detour that I decided to take.

297
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,000
There you go.

298
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:45,020
How was I supposed to know you were supposed to stop swimming?

299
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,400
Okay.

300
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,190
Nobody warned me that.

301
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,790
Nero, thank you for the super chat.

302
00:26:59,050 --> 00:26:59,690
Thank you.

303
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:02,390
Welcome to Path of Pain, too.

304
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,510
Wee.

305
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,230
Oh, shit!

306
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:23,150
What?

307
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:30,550
Well, at least it gave me a path.

308
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:32,510
I guess.

309
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,230
I guess.

310
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:37,190
I was like, what's that rock doing there?

311
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,820
Alright, nice.

312
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,520
We made it.

313
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,060
How do I...

314
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,740
How do I get that bench, though?

315
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,240
Uh...

316
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,480
How do I get that bench?

317
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,280
Oh, well.

318
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,520
Got money.

319
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,780
What's over here?

320
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,580
Wait, which way do I go?

321
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,400
Wait, down and then right.

322
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:08,840
Oh.

323
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,360
Oh!

324
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,700
Nice.

325
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:15,820
Yeah!

326
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,740
Okay, 60.

327
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,060
That means it's a forever chair.

328
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,180
Oh my god.

329
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,060
Yay, my forever chair.

330
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,360
Wait, what's to my left?

331
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,760
Is there anything here?

332
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:35,680
Okay.

333
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,800
Wait, how do I get that?

334
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,540
Wait, what?

335
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,760
What is over there?

336
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,400
Oh, I need double jump.

337
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,420
Can't believe it.

338
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:53,920
Paywalled!

339
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,240
I can't believe they would paywall that mask.

340
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:00,500
Alright.

341
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,560
Okay.

342
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,920
Now we all figured that this is worse than Path of Pain.

343
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:07,960
Honestly.

344
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,980
I will say this is 100% worse.

345
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,520
Because now I can get frostbite.

346
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,640
I think the fear of frostbite is a lot worse.

347
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,940
Than whatever the fuck Fafapain was.

348
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,280
I did not do.

349
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,160
I was there in spirit.

350
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,780
I was there in spirit.

351
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:42,900
Oh my god.

352
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,820
mess that up.

353
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,340
Wait, there's a lever?

354
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,520
Where the fuck is the lever?

355
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,200
Oh my God, there was a lever below me.

356
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,200
I was like, it was right below me.

357
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,720
I almost forgot about it.

358
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,900
I came down here for the lever and I forgot about it.

359
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,080
I was just like, ooh, bench.

360
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,260
Yeah.

361
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,400
I just felt so happy about seeing the bench.

362
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:16,260
I forgot there was another reason why I came down here.

363
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,300
Alright.

364
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,560
Parkour time.

365
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,120
Wait, I gotta warm up.

366
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,700
I don't want them to cut my toes.

367
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,860
Too fair, I have one singular toes.

368
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,420
I feel like it's like I've cut off my entire...

369
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,260
What if I... What if I don't have legs?

370
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,040
What if it's just a long-ass toe?

371
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,640
Oh my god, are you serious?

372
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,860
I fucked it up again.

373
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,100
I don't want to imagine that.

374
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:58,310
Okay.

375
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:01,650
No!

376
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:03,870
Wee!

377
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:07,810
Alright, I sit down.

378
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:11,890
Oh!

379
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,010
That's frustrating.

380
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,290
Holy shit, that's so frustrating.

381
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:24,030
be, like, super precise.

382
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,560
No!

383
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,080
Shit!

384
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,000
Oh, secret to the right is a bench?

385
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,280
Oh, my God.

386
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,280
Are you fucking kidding me?

387
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,800
There was a bench over there all along.

388
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,860
It's that one area.

389
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,000
It's literally that one area.

390
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,420
Oh, no.

391
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,500
It was just some one guy.

392
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,140
Who was it?

393
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,000
Who was it?

394
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:11,540
Oh, there's a secret right to the bench.

395
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,480
Are you serious?

396
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,180
It's because I accidentally press A.

397
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:27,640
When I press A, I accidentally press this when I'm trying to...

398
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,400
I feel like I...

399
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,720
It feels like I have double jump right now.

400
00:32:35,620 --> 00:33:01,200

401
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:12,780

402
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:17,780
I need to, like, not hold A, though, whenever I get off the bug.

403
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,300
I don't know what's wrong with me.

404
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,320
I don't know what's wrong with me.

405
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,440
Why?

406
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,880
Why can't I do it anymore?

407
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,020
I'm in my own head.

408
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,680
I'm in my own head.

409
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,660
I'm actually in my own head now.

410
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:44,440
Okay.

411
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,500
Focus up.

412
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,960
It's not that stiff.

413
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:48,940
Oh my god.

414
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,040
It's...

415
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,820
I'm overthinking now.

416
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,760
I'm actually overthinking.

417
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,600
Okay, lock the fuck in.

418
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:10,430
Okay.

419
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:14,070
There you go.

420
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:18,500
Yeah.

421
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,400

422
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,600

Okay, that's fine.

00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:25,170
I'll just use you as a pogo.

492
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,130
Like a mob.

493
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,230
I can't help it!

494
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:29,050

495
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:30,910
Tracted to the flame.

496
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:40,370

Oh, we did it.

502
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,220
We got dumped.

503
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,520
That has to be double jump.

504
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:58,380
All right.

505
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:02,140
All right.

506
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,520
I did it.

507
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:18,720
Okay.

508
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:19,480
Hello?

515
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,820
Fable feathered down.

516
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,280

Now it's my turn to grab the mask.

580
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,260
Let's sit down a little.

581
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,360
All right, now...

582
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,300
Now we do this.

583
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,040
How do we do this?

584
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:43,570
Oh, is it up here?

585
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:46,710
Oh, I can just wall right there.

586
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:50,870
Well, I was wondering, why the fuck was the bug there?

587
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:53,130
Yay!

588
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:54,090
More HP.

589
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:56,630
No, I wasn't blind.

590
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:59,970
I was like, why did they place this random bug floating there?

591
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:01,690
Am I supposed to parkour?

592
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:04,130
Like...

593
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:07,590
Yeah, now I can take four hits.

594
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:10,970
I know it looks like a lot of HP, but it's just four hits.

595
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:14,590
Wait, can this still hurt me?

596
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:15,350
Oh, shit.

597
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:16,550
Water's still bad.

598
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:19,310
Who would have thought?

599
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:22,690
Water apparently was still bad.

600
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,540
I didn't tank this.

601
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:33,280
It will just work.

602
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,320
Oh, my God.

603
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,480
Guys, I have a feeling I might not be able to tank this much.

604
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,080
Maybe I gotta stop tanking it.

605
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,640
Oh my god.

606
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,640
Why is it just that much?

607
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:52,100
Oh!

608
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:57,140
I thought the light would...

609
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:58,680
Oh my god, where am I?

610
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:00,740
Okay, it's not that far.

611
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:01,140
Okay.

612
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,740
I don't know.

613
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,580
I thought the light would just stop.

614
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:10,380
I didn't realize it's the world's, like, strong.

615
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,580
flashlight, guys.

616
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,540
I was very unaware.

617
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:18,480
It was the world's strongest flashlight.

618
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,840
There we go.

619
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:30,640
Alright, there we go.

620
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,500
I can take four hits.

621
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:40,620
Okay, I gotta kill this, actually.

622
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:42,540
I don't trust myself anymore.

623
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,520
I... Wait, what?

624
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,900
It's, like, baked me!

625
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:54,560
Truly the world's...

626
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,640
Okay, where do I go now?

627
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:57,300
I guess I'll just go down.

628
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:03,800
That hurt.

629
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:11,890

Show me where the parry skill is.

636
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:31,650
I've been doing so much parrying.

637
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:37,000
I'll prove it.

638
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:40,780

00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:13,450
I'm there.

697
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:14,630
Oh, wait.

698
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:15,750
No, it's above me.

699
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:17,290
Where's the elevators?

700
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:17,770
Okay.

701
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:19,010
I gotta go here.

702
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:23,830
I gotta approach from the left.

703
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:25,490
Uh, I guess I gotta go turn.

704
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:26,270
Oh, wait, no.

705
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:27,730
Unpack seat above.

706
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:29,690
You could have set the donut!

707
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:32,970
That's not on me.

708
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:36,910
Why didn't you say donut?

709
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:43,490
I don't think you listen to the chat.

710
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:44,550
Thank you.

711
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:50,650
I forgot to swap my charms, but I would live with my mistake.

712
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:53,510
Oh, there's a chair right here, anyway.

00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:56,770
Never mind.

714
00:56:56,890 --> 00:56:58,130

715
00:56:58,870 --> 00:56:58,950

752
01:00:44,070 --> 01:00:44,550
Okay.

753
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:47,270
Then from here, I got a parkour.

754
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:51,810
Oh my god, I tried...

755
01:00:51,810 --> 01:00:52,670
I was trying to...

756
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:55,270
I was trying to use it as, like, a platform to parkour.

757
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,080
Okay, there's this.

758
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:09,080
Are you serious?

759
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,260
There was a gear here?

760
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,580
Oh, get out!

761
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:13,520
I'm Angy.

762
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:23,400
Yeah, I might have to change.

763
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:24,840
I think I might change.

764
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:33,090
I might have to change my crest.

765
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:40,070
Is what a coward would say!

766
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:40,930
Oh, shit!

767
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:44,090
Oh, shit!

768
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:45,350
We did it.

769
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:56,450
Oh my god, oh my god, I'm back here.

770
01:01:56,490 --> 01:01:57,530
I'm back here.

771
01:01:59,110 --> 01:02:00,530
Oh, this is bad.

772
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:07,720
Okay.

773
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,460
Oh my god, oh my god, no!

774
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,240
It's okay, we got a shortcut.

775
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,020
We got a shortcut, it's okay.

776
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,940
I need to remember it.

777
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,500
Like, I double jump.

778
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:41,420
Oh my god, this is so annoying.

779
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:42,960
It's actually so annoying.

780
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:45,840
Goodness.

781
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:53,960
Oh!

782
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:00,910
Ah!

783
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:03,810
I don't know how I made it.

784
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:06,850
I seriously...

785
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:07,530
Ah!

786
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:12,430
There you go.

787
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:13,590
We did it.

788
01:03:13,810 --> 01:03:14,730
We did it.

789
01:03:15,610 --> 01:03:16,550
That's all that matters.

790
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:20,730
Let's try to press LB.

791
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:22,190
That's all that matters.

792
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:22,910
That's all.

793
01:03:23,770 --> 01:03:25,530
Let's try to press LB.

794
01:03:28,450 --> 01:03:29,050
Yay!

795
01:03:30,770 --> 01:03:32,590
We made it.

796
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,700
A little singing man in the basement.

797
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:39,980
There's a man that lives in my basement.

798
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:43,580
get rid of the problem.

799
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:54,220
It's a boss fight, isn't it?

800
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,080
It was a boss fight, isn't it?

801
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:01,460
Oh my...

802
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:04,820
Oh my god, please.

803
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:06,620
I was not...

804
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:09,140
I was not ready for a boss fight!

805
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:15,180
Okay.

806
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:16,440
Okay, we're a little bit...

807
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:17,780
a little bit fucked right now.

808
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:23,800
I was not ready.

809
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:25,300
I was not ready.

810
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,500
I was just like, hey, everyone.

811
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:34,500
I was, I was, oh my god, you unlocked that area.

812
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:37,100
I run right into the area.

813
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:38,780
I was, I just gave up.

814
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:39,560
Right.

815
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:45,560
The moment, I, I double jump.

816
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:47,900
I have double jumped.

817
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,200
jumped yet again.

818
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:56,840
Okay, let's grab the other shortcut too, while we're at it.

819
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:00,820
What?

820
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:07,370
How is this?

821
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:10,030
Excuse me, I climbed that!

822
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:18,120
Okay.

823
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:29,470
There we go.

824
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:30,790
What is over here?

825
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:33,270
Alright, we grab the other shortcut.

826
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:37,990
What's this area?

827
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:42,630
Wait, I actually don't know what...

828
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:43,290
What is this area?

829
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:51,100
What is this area?

830
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,160
I don't know what this area is.

831
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:00,220
Oh, it's the upper half.

832
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:01,860
Oh, I see it.

833
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:04,160
So I don't have to be here, technically.

834
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:05,860
Oh!

835
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:07,000
Whoops.

836
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:10,620
Time to slowly float down to my death.

837
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:11,120
Whoa!

838
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:14,960
Alright.

839
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:16,480
We're gonna...

840
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,540
Oh my god.

841
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:20,960
I don't know how to get out of here safely.

842
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:24,340
I actually don't know.

843
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:25,820
I don't know.

844
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:29,900
Oh my god.

845
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:31,620
I don't know how to get there safely, guys.

846
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:32,600
I...

847
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:33,920
I got a bench.

848
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:35,540
I'm gonna bench real quick.

849
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:38,140
I'm gonna use a bench.

850
01:06:44,950 --> 01:06:45,510
Okay.

851
01:06:47,390 --> 01:06:48,920
Now to safely up.

852
01:06:50,130 --> 01:06:51,070
Load down.

853
01:06:52,310 --> 01:06:53,630
Very safe.

854
01:06:53,950 --> 01:06:54,970
Very safe!

855
01:06:57,150 --> 01:06:59,650
I'm trying my best.

856
01:07:02,110 --> 01:07:06,490
It's easier to go up than it is to go down.

857
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:08,950
Oh wait, no, I did it.

858
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:09,870
It was easier.

859
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:19,900
Here we go.

860
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:22,440

I was using this.

866
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:14,250
That's right.

867
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:15,510

881
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:50,820
Dear!

882
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:56,710
Oh my god, he comboed me.

883
01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:02,570
Okay, I actually want to do that just for the silk.

884
01:09:04,090 --> 01:09:04,450
Fuen!

885
01:09:05,730 --> 01:09:06,670
There you go.

886
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:09,830
Watch this.

887
01:09:11,470 --> 01:09:11,730
Chee!

888
01:09:12,110 --> 01:09:12,430
Chee!

889
01:09:13,470 --> 01:09:14,630
Chee him!

890
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:17,370
Chee something!

891
01:09:21,650 --> 01:09:27,790
There we go, that no more singing in the court of Dokilan, chainsaw.

892
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:32,290
That's fuck you, right?

893
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:33,650
Give me my oil.

894
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:36,950
I crave the oil.

895
01:09:39,190 --> 01:09:43,730
It's like, go chainsaw, use chainsaw attack.

896
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:47,730
I have banned singing.

897
01:09:48,690 --> 01:09:50,330
In the land of Doki Land.

898
01:09:50,730 --> 01:09:51,050
Oh, wait.

899
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:53,450
That seems like a bad guy.

900
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:55,970
Chainsaw time.

901
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:56,970
Oh, my God.

902
01:09:57,210 --> 01:09:58,730
He jumps over my...

903
01:09:58,730 --> 01:09:59,110
That's right.

904
01:09:59,370 --> 01:10:01,570
He jumps over my chainsaw.

905
01:10:02,610 --> 01:10:03,670
That's fucked.

906
01:10:06,330 --> 01:10:08,350
He can just do that.

907
01:10:11,610 --> 01:10:14,470
It was super effective.

908
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:17,950
He can just jump over it.

909
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:28,480
Oh my god.

910
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:29,500
Who would have thought?

911
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:31,400
Air.

912
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:34,140
Air type is strong against chainsaw type.

913
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:36,760
Yeah, I need that.

914
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:41,280
Who would have thought, guys?

915
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:46,200
Flying type is so strong.

916
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:49,760
Secret.

917
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:51,480
Oh, nice.

918
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:52,880
Ahoy.

919
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:54,620
Yeah,

920
01:10:59,480 --> 01:10:59,480
shortcut.

921
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:06,360
What's the point?

922
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,320
Maybe he's just guarding the secret, I guess.

923
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:11,320
Ignore.

924
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:14,280
I...

925
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:17,820
I didn't think he would...

926
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:23,380
I wasn't expecting him to just, you know, fly down.

927
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:27,680
To the left, okay.

928
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:29,800
To the left, to the left.

929
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:33,960
Is this way?

930
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:35,380
I want the oil.

931
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:38,680
I'll go- I'm going- I'm gunning straight for the oil first.

932
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:42,160
Oil more important.

933
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:46,280
Oh, it's you.

934
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:48,420
I don't know.

935
01:11:52,530 --> 01:11:54,750
I'll just kill him just for the sake of it.

936
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:55,810
I need money anyway.

937
01:11:57,510 --> 01:11:57,710
Hey.

938
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:00,770
I thank God he can't jump.

939
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:26,820
is puzzle no don't say that don't say that there's no puzzles here okay there you go all right it's not like he's gonna come down or anything do i have to keep going left or is he around here

940
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:32,680
is this the puzzle

941
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:44,870
oh my god this is the puzzle This is... This is not positive.

942
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:47,810
Okay.

943
01:12:49,010 --> 01:12:51,030
I can figure this out.

944
01:12:56,050 --> 01:12:58,690
Oh my god, this is my own personal hell, I guess.

945
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:05,260
That's fine.

946
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:11,000
Can I bring this one down?

947
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:20,110
Okay, what can I... What can I push?

948
01:13:23,110 --> 01:13:25,170
Oh my god, there was this area.

949
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:36,280
Up I go.

950
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:40,280
That's not it?

951
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:49,020
Okay.

952
01:13:56,150 --> 01:13:57,210
What else do I do?

953
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:01,690
Oh, there we go.

954
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:08,660
Okay, now what?

955
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:10,840
Now...

956
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:17,760
Where am I?

957
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:18,480
Oh, there it is.

958
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:18,980
Yay!

959
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:21,500
Just keep smacking.

960
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:23,860
That's my... That's the plan.

961
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:26,920
You keep smacking something.

962
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:28,240
It'll eventually work.

963
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:30,820
Easy.

964
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,240
Just hit everything.

965
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,400
Alright, now I got the order.

966
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:39,660
Gotta go straight down.

967
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:42,340
Yeah, I'll just go straight down.

968
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:42,960
Fuck it.

969
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,360
I'll get my nail upgrade.

970
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:54,880
Wee, wee!

971
01:14:57,140 --> 01:14:58,420
That's the jokie way.

972
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:01,400
You smack it enough, and then you'll get the thing.

973
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:04,280
Alright, now I marked my map.

974
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,040
No, this is my second upgrade.

975
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:12,160
Where is Bellheart?

976
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:12,760
Oh, there it is.

977
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:14,160
There's so many things on my map.

978
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:19,840
Ventus, thank you, the super chat, thank you.

979
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:21,380
I think we're making good progress.

980
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:22,500
I didn't even do it alright.

981
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:25,620
We haven't had an actual boss fight yet, but...

982
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:28,820
But we went through parkour hell again.

983
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:31,860
Yeah.

984
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:35,880
I just gotta, like, get used to double jump.

985
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:39,240
I've been floating for so long that...

986
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:41,020
I'm not used to it.

987
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:44,840
Hello, I have oil.

988
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:50,080
Pinmaster, I've acquired oil with which my needle may see further sharpening.

989
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:53,600
Bonva, what wonder.

990
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:56,940
What wish to steal a gift so fine.

991
01:15:57,660 --> 01:16:01,440
Few are the pinmasters of our age that ever worked with such substance.

992
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:04,260
All right, here's your oil.

993
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:06,240
Toronto, we shall work.

994
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:08,040
Now as never.

995
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:11,820
What joy you grant this humble artisan, traveler.

996
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:13,560
Let us seek that shine.

997
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:15,720
They'll last within these lands.

998
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:19,020
I got the oil.

999
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:25,000
And now, this pinmaster must work.

1000
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,160
Let the sharpening begin.

1001
01:16:32,690 --> 01:16:34,810
And more champagne to the Nile.

1002
01:16:45,650 --> 01:16:46,190
Stop.

1003
01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:49,650
Galil, stop.

1004
01:16:52,930 --> 01:16:54,290
Done it is.

1005
01:16:54,550 --> 01:17:01,330
Marvel of Farlum, see a glim, your long, fine blade.

1006
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:08,690
Harvest, to the pins of our land, all once held such shine, so much we have lost.

1007
01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:14,530
This is fine service, Pin Master, as been long ago since I've seen my needle such.

1008
01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:18,690
I had not remembered the finest finesse of its forging.

1009
01:17:19,310 --> 01:17:23,870
Well, ye ho, it is certain, yours is blade of finer make than most.

1010
01:17:24,550 --> 01:17:27,070
a few that could bear even more sharpening.

1011
01:17:27,830 --> 01:17:28,510
Oh my god.

1012
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:31,310
I can, like, slice a tomato with my needle.

1013
01:17:33,130 --> 01:17:37,590
If you ever ponder your long road more oil is acquired, seek my surface with haste.

1014
01:17:37,990 --> 01:17:41,790
Who knows what form we can find deeper within your weapon's sharpened steel.

1015
01:17:42,550 --> 01:17:43,610
Alright, what's the plan?

1016
01:17:44,710 --> 01:17:46,230
Oh, I can go for the next oil?

1017
01:17:47,050 --> 01:17:47,490
Alright.

1018
01:17:48,210 --> 01:17:54,530
Let's make this blade so sharp I can slice air and create a mini-bombing.

1019
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:55,730
Sonic Boom.

1020
01:18:04,010 --> 01:18:04,190
Oh, wait.

1021
01:18:04,290 --> 01:18:05,450
Actually, we could get Perry now.

1022
01:18:05,530 --> 01:18:06,110
You know, fuck it.

1023
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:07,070
I'm going to prove you guys.

1024
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:09,070
I will.

1025
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:13,970
Just like Simba, I shall go to the elephant graveyard.

1026
01:18:14,950 --> 01:18:15,570
Don't worry.

1027
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:17,390
My daddy will save me.

1028
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:18,510
Right, guys?

1029
01:18:23,790 --> 01:18:25,590
We can do it.

1030
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:28,690
Just like Simba.

1031
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:29,930
Mufasa will come.

1032
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:31,530
and save me, guys, right?

1033
01:18:32,090 --> 01:18:32,430
Right?

1034
01:18:32,510 --> 01:18:35,230
I'm not going in there alone, right, guys?

1035
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:39,090
This is a spend money person.

1036
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:41,010
Why do I need to spend money?

1037
01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:43,070
What are you guys trying to tell me?

1038
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:51,170
I don't understand.

1039
01:18:51,610 --> 01:18:52,370
Wait, what's this?

1040
01:18:52,910 --> 01:18:53,310
Oh, hey.

1041
01:18:57,330 --> 01:18:58,850
There's another merchant?

1042
01:19:00,170 --> 01:19:01,970
Long live, the king.

1043
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:05,590
Where's this guy?

1044
01:19:07,370 --> 01:19:09,290
I didn't realize we have another merchant.

1045
01:19:14,310 --> 01:19:15,130
What the fuck?

1046
01:19:15,790 --> 01:19:17,170
Oh, oh, guy, okay, I thought...

1047
01:19:17,170 --> 01:19:19,230
I thought that was a real crow.

1048
01:19:19,610 --> 01:19:20,690
It's working, guys.

1049
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:22,910
The scarecrow is working.

1050
01:19:23,930 --> 01:19:24,930
That freaked me out.

1051
01:19:25,050 --> 01:19:26,970
I was like, holy shit, what was he eating?

1052
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:31,170
Guys, that's when you know it's working.

1053
01:19:31,650 --> 01:19:33,110
I legitimately thought it was real.

1054
01:19:38,970 --> 01:19:39,830
Are you serious?

1055
01:19:40,030 --> 01:19:42,690
How the fuck did... How did he get over there?

1056
01:19:48,130 --> 01:19:49,550
I got scared.

1057
01:19:51,150 --> 01:19:53,430
He was, like, all the way to the right side.

1058
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,200
Like, it was all the way over there.

1059
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:09,760
Oh, no, we lost the trail.

1060
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:10,700
Oh, wait, here it is.

1061
01:20:16,810 --> 01:20:18,250
Okay, this guy better be flying.

1062
01:20:18,330 --> 01:20:20,110
Because I don't know how the fuck he's doing this.

1063
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:25,640
Oh my god, he's sick.

1064
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:26,920
He took me to Sinner's Road.

1065
01:20:29,260 --> 01:20:31,260
He actually took me to Sinner's Road.

1066
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:32,900
That fucking madman.

1067
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:38,200
I wasn't even trying to get to Sinner's Road by doing this.

1068
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:43,700
Oh my god, where is he going?

1069
01:20:48,530 --> 01:20:51,850
Ha ha roads eventually lead to Sinner Road.

1070
01:20:58,790 --> 01:21:00,470
Oh my god, how the fuck?

1071
01:21:01,010 --> 01:21:02,830
At least I don't want to be jailed for my crimes.

1072
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:07,880
Are you serious?

1073
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:09,200
Oh my god, fucked up.

1074
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,940
Actually, I'm gonna do this again.

1075
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:17,860
I had to do this area again.

1076
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:20,500
Ah, no!

1077
01:21:20,740 --> 01:21:21,400
No, my silk!

1078
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,360
Oh my god, my silk!

1079
01:21:32,990 --> 01:21:34,210
Where did he go?

1080
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:36,090
How did he...

1081
01:21:36,650 --> 01:21:38,550
Oh my god, the trail is cold.

1082
01:21:39,830 --> 01:21:40,150
Oh no.

1083
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:46,560
Oh my god.

1084
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:47,780
Oh my god.

1085
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:49,620
I got it.

1086
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:50,220
Hello.

1087
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:54,920
Safely save this, Pell.

1088
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,800
But who is this rare care for the shell of another?

1089
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,060
Name yourself, good bug.

1090
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,360
I am Hornet, Pell.

1091
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:04,140
Your brother wished for your return.

1092
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:07,400
He's not even flying!

1093
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:09,500
How did he do all these moves?

1094
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:11,020
How did you get here?

1095
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:14,700
Where he waits now, I'm sure you'll be eager to see you alive.

1096
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:17,680
Young tip, how he worries always.

1097
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:19,480
Blessed I am for the care.

1098
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:23,000
Him and you, Miss Hornet, a lucky bug is me.

1099
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:27,440
All right, fly.

1100
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,500
Show me that you can fly.

1101
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:33,240
It's fast for pill, heart pill.

1102
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:34,660
Bell heart, pill.

1103
01:22:34,780 --> 01:23:19,500

1106
01:24:12,890 --> 01:24:14,950
Here we will remain for shells to survive.

1107
01:24:16,290 --> 01:24:18,870
But we instead did plan together clever.

1108
01:24:19,290 --> 01:24:22,530
Yes, yes, those pilgrims, them that pass, maybe they will help.

1109
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:24,150
For small reward as we have.

1110
01:24:24,410 --> 01:24:25,410
Even you, Miss saving.

1111
01:24:25,610 --> 01:24:26,990
Yes, yes, saving is done.

1112
01:24:27,150 --> 01:24:28,310
Our wishes now, we ask.

1113
01:24:28,650 --> 01:24:30,050
Now it's time for Miss Couriers.

1114
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:34,450
Couriers, I require a raster of meat for an old bug in the citadel.

1115
01:24:34,890 --> 01:24:35,810
Can you prepare for me?

1116
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:37,310
A bug up up?

1117
01:24:37,670 --> 01:24:39,310
Nays know our finest foods.

1118
01:24:39,610 --> 01:24:41,890
If they appreciate, we can prepare it.

1119
01:24:41,890 --> 01:24:42,790
Morse prompt.

1120
01:24:43,090 --> 01:24:45,450
Miss Corrie has only to ask.

1121
01:24:47,590 --> 01:24:48,450
Oh my god, goodbye.

1122
01:24:49,670 --> 01:24:49,710
Goodbye.

1123
01:24:50,150 --> 01:24:51,010
I know what this is.

1124
01:24:52,050 --> 01:24:52,270
Goodbye.

1125
01:24:52,410 --> 01:24:54,270
I shall never speak to you again.

1126
01:24:59,870 --> 01:25:01,490
You have never existed.

1127
01:25:01,950 --> 01:25:02,910
I can't believe it.

1128
01:25:03,030 --> 01:25:07,630
I saved this life and all I get as a reward is a fucking fetch quest.

1129
01:25:09,910 --> 01:25:11,370
No, it's not even a fetch quest.

1130
01:25:11,670 --> 01:25:13,010
It's an escort mission.

1131
01:25:13,390 --> 01:25:14,870
That's so fucked up.

1132
01:25:15,170 --> 01:25:18,930
I saved your life and you give me an escort mission?

1133
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,780
I have to be your new Ubaite?

1134
01:25:38,130 --> 01:25:39,030
That's evil.

1135
01:25:39,330 --> 01:25:40,310
That's so evil.

1136
01:25:41,990 --> 01:25:43,670
Wait, did I go to... No, it's this way.

1137
01:25:45,270 --> 01:25:47,570
I'll turn on the elevator for now.

1138
01:25:50,230 --> 01:25:59,650
someone but why does that have to be me why am I that someone I bet he doesn't even tip

1139
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:20,480
okay I need to remember how to do this without the courier to help me I feel like I went like the long way yeah I could have just done that I had to follow this fucking trail and when I could have just done that

1140
01:26:26,530 --> 01:26:27,170
I fucked up.

1141
01:26:27,410 --> 01:26:28,330
I fucked up.

1142
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:29,210
I fucked up.

1143
01:26:30,710 --> 01:26:31,530
It's okay.

1144
01:26:31,870 --> 01:26:33,490
I have the hot ground.

1145
01:26:33,850 --> 01:26:34,950
These dogs don't know.

1146
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:37,490
Alright.

1147
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:38,930
Do we save him?

1148
01:26:39,990 --> 01:26:42,450
Do we save the prince of Zimbabwe?

1149
01:26:46,370 --> 01:26:48,710
Do we save this man?

1150
01:26:52,350 --> 01:27:04,950
Guys, he said he promises me like 500 grand if i save him i might as well all right this cost me 500

1151
01:27:13,730 --> 01:27:34,750
i heard he's the prince of zimbabwe so i'm freed despite no request of mine for aid hey i received an email that said that you would give me 500 grand if i pay 500 for this key for this amazon gift card

1152
01:27:38,330 --> 01:27:58,970
and i do not ask gratitude the key merely fits the lock if you choose stay in here and wait till your shell hardens the crust he needs just a small donation to be freed no i shall depart shortly with my way clear my wish again propels me though i've tried to avoid it Then,

1153
01:27:59,410 --> 01:28:00,770
safe journey to our bug.

1154
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:02,130
I'll not pry further.

1155
01:28:02,770 --> 01:28:04,050
Clearly you have your own burden.

1156
01:28:04,710 --> 01:28:05,170
Is that it?

1157
01:28:06,890 --> 01:28:07,930
Is that it?

1158
01:28:08,110 --> 01:28:08,810
Where's my money?

1159
01:28:09,290 --> 01:28:10,030
Where's my money?

1160
01:28:10,410 --> 01:28:11,130
That's right!

1161
01:28:11,590 --> 01:28:12,350
Where is it?

1162
01:28:12,670 --> 01:28:14,390
Oh, you see what I'm doing to this jail cell?

1163
01:28:14,530 --> 01:28:15,990
That's gonna be you next.

1164
01:28:17,170 --> 01:28:19,250
I'm gonna find you and I'll kill you.

1165
01:28:21,290 --> 01:28:22,970
I can't believe it.

1166
01:28:23,210 --> 01:28:25,450
The prince of Zimbabwe scanned me.

1167
01:28:25,850 --> 01:28:26,890
I'm so sad.

1168
01:28:29,950 --> 01:28:31,270
I got scammed.

1169
01:28:37,070 --> 01:28:38,710
All right, this way.

1170
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:46,180
All right, how do we fix this stupid fucking bench?

1171
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:47,100
Oh,

1172
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:51,260
hey, money.

1173
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:54,260
All right, we'll fix this later.

1174
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,880
First off, we gotta get that money.

1175
01:28:57,940 --> 01:29:00,220
Oh my god, it's the parkour of hell, isn't it?

1176
01:29:01,220 --> 01:29:13,320
this isn't it it's oh my god it was this all along to fix it i had to do that that's so messed up

1177
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:34,020
oh my oh my i didn't see a spike sorry i did not see the spike oh my god that still hits me i should be legally allowed to cut that i i don't know why I see, oh my god, I'm fucking dead

1178
01:29:47,520 --> 01:30:08,380
Tops, I was like, it's over, I can try, I'll hit my head I can't, I can't, I can't help it, I'm too tall, I keep forgetting that there's spikes above me I kept doing it again and again, I was like, surely the fifth time will be different, right?

1179
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:17,760
I was like, I think after the fifth time, my head would have got rid of most of the spikes.

1180
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:21,460
Like a mop to the flame.

1181
01:30:26,820 --> 01:30:29,180
It doesn't really matter if I work these guys.

1182
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:30,260
Yeah, I was going to sit.

1183
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:36,480
Eventually, my head would have got rid of all the spikes.

1184
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:41,760
I don't understand.

1185
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:53,160
all right here you go

1186
01:30:57,220 --> 01:31:00,220
oh my god I fucked up there

1187
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:23,840
I hate this air oh my god I'm doing it again I did it again I keep doing it again you don't understand it calls to me I'm a maybe my dad was one fourth mom

1188
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:30,720
Oh, no.

1189
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:32,040
No.

1190
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:33,520
No.

1191
01:31:39,180 --> 01:31:39,700
Okay.

1192
01:31:44,380 --> 01:31:46,380
Alright, we did it.

1193
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:51,120
We figured it out.

1194
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:55,320
There we go.

1195
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:02,100
I like how the shortcut back I still have to go through this.

1196
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:02,900
Thank God I have to.

1197
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:03,840
double jump.

1198
01:32:05,060 --> 01:32:06,520
Thank fucking guy.

1199
01:32:09,260 --> 01:32:10,300
Alright.

1200
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:12,640
Where's the parry?

1201
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:15,800
Alright.

1202
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:17,580
Where is it?

1203
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:19,720
Tell me.

1204
01:32:32,860 --> 01:32:34,920
Now go top left here.

1205
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:38,240
Or here?

1206
01:32:39,540 --> 01:32:40,400
One?

1207
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:42,180
Or two?

1208
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:50,080
Shame of YouTubers are just like some punk-ass celebrities.

1209
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:56,520
Sorry, I don't know if that's what Perry is, but like, one or...

1210
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:03,680
Is that where the Perry is?

1211
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:09,980
Wait, left side.

1212
01:33:10,140 --> 01:33:10,880
That's actually easier.

1213
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:12,440
Left or right?

1214
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:13,500
Okay, left.

1215
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:16,680
Guys, is this left?

1216
01:33:17,420 --> 01:33:19,620
Is this one left?

1217
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:24,840
They're saying that, like, I don't interact.

1218
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,480
I feel like I interact so much with my chat.

1219
01:33:30,660 --> 01:33:33,100
But it's mostly me being like, where do I go?

1220
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:39,440
Let's see.

1221
01:33:40,980 --> 01:33:41,820
That's crazy.

1222
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:43,840
I am the wrong example for that, sir.

1223
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:53,360
I interact, but I don't listen.

1224
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:55,600
Okay, that's true.

1225
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,100
No, it's not that I don't listen.

1226
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:00,540
It's that I get one guy.

1227
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:03,380
That's different.

1228
01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:05,100
I still listen.

1229
01:34:05,420 --> 01:34:07,560
I just don't listen to the right person.

1230
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:14,260
The shame of VTuber-Doki.

1231
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:18,780
I do listen.

1232
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:20,900
Do I listen to the right person?

1233
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:22,640
Hmm, I...

1234
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:24,260
That's a different question.

1235
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:26,880
Oh my god.

1236
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:27,980
Let me out of here!

1237
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:28,720
Let me...

1238
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:30,100
Let me out of here.

1239
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:37,960
My father was right.

1240
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:40,340
Why did I go to the elephant graveyard?

1241
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:42,780
Why did I...

1242
01:34:42,780 --> 01:34:43,980
No!

1243
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:45,340
That's...

1244
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:46,720
That's on me.

1245
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:49,100
That's actually on me.

1246
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:53,580
Oh, wait.

1247
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:54,280
There's you.

1248
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:57,840
I was like trying to find the fucking secret door.

1249
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:03,740
Oh, no.

1250
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:06,120
Oh, no.

1251
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:09,680
Why did you take me here?

1252
01:35:12,460 --> 01:35:14,860
This is the kissing ghost.

1253
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:17,440
I've seen them.

1254
01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:22,500
Please, don't suck out my soul.

1255
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:31,300
Toki turned back I did not consent no kisses

1256
01:35:34,510 --> 01:35:37,910
Oh my god, where the fuck is that map for this area?

1257
01:35:38,950 --> 01:35:39,270
Oh

1258
01:35:44,090 --> 01:35:55,790
no, there she is please no kisses I'll give you a handshake, but please No kiss

1259
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:03,580
Oh no, oh no No, she wants the kiss.

1260
01:36:05,620 --> 01:36:06,160
Okay, it's fine.

1261
01:36:07,420 --> 01:36:08,620
There's no map for this area.

1262
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,280
How will I ever know where to go?

1263
01:36:10,820 --> 01:36:11,780
Oh, my God, goodbye.

1264
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:16,300
They just want to kiss.

1265
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:18,600
Please, I'm not going to kiss your baby.

1266
01:36:28,790 --> 01:36:29,230
Alright.

1267
01:36:32,490 --> 01:36:34,690
God, I can't fix my silk problem.

1268
01:36:35,570 --> 01:36:36,250
So bad.

1269
01:36:37,590 --> 01:36:39,210
I am like...

1270
01:36:39,910 --> 01:36:42,290
I'm, like, on my deathbed right now.

1271
01:36:44,210 --> 01:36:46,010
It's not the kissing ghost.

1272
01:36:46,550 --> 01:36:47,450
Woman's scary.

1273
01:36:50,350 --> 01:36:51,090
Where am I?

1274
01:36:51,290 --> 01:36:52,670
Oh, I'm still looking at my map.

1275
01:36:55,750 --> 01:36:56,550
Wait, now I'm here.

1276
01:36:57,370 --> 01:36:58,130
Did I go back?

1277
01:36:58,190 --> 01:36:59,190
I went backwards.

1278
01:36:59,850 --> 01:37:01,730
I went backwards.

1279
01:37:02,110 --> 01:37:02,530
I...

1280
01:37:05,010 --> 01:37:05,610
I...

1281
01:37:05,610 --> 01:37:09,890
I felt like I made so much crazy, crazy...

1282
01:37:09,910 --> 01:37:20,640
progress I don't understand welcome back

1283
01:37:24,970 --> 01:37:29,690
they not make progress with

1284
01:37:33,460 --> 01:37:35,880
the butterflies telling me where to go

1285
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:57,490
I'm dying right now oh my god please I'm playing a song of my people

1286
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:02,780
Where'd it go?

1287
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:05,080
Upright, okay.

1288
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:10,140
Wait, where did they go?

1289
01:38:10,540 --> 01:38:11,380
Where did it?

1290
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,760
Oh my god, not the ghost.

1291
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:16,280
Oh, there they are.

1292
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:19,700
I shall play you the song of my people.

1293
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:25,680
Where did they

1294
01:38:29,060 --> 01:38:29,440
go?

1295
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:31,640
Oh, this way.

1296
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:35,400
Where's the next butterfly?

1297
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:36,220
Oh!

1298
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:38,100
Okay, that's good!

1299
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:38,620

01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:39,820
That's good!

1301
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:43,220
They got me away from her.

1302
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:53,860
Okay.

1303
01:38:56,900 --> 01:38:57,500

1304
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:06,480

1305
01:39:08,660 --> 01:39:09,260

Why do I just die here?

1308
01:39:49,080 --> 01:39:49,880
Or die closer.

1309
01:39:57,250 --> 01:39:57,790
Yeah.

1310
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:01,930
Get me out of here.

I'll go back and down and sit.

01:40:05,010 --> 01:40:06,010
I'm tired.

1313
01:40:10,330 --> 01:40:12,110
Imagine if I touched that.

1314
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:18,740
I mean, I'm already infected.

1315
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:19,320
It's fine.

1316
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:20,600
There we go.

1317
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:23,880
The bug they're allergic to chair.

1318
01:40:29,130 --> 01:40:29,570
Alright.

1319
01:40:29,950 --> 01:40:30,990
We do this again.

1320
01:40:34,590 --> 01:40:35,190
Oh my god, please.

1321
01:40:35,870 --> 01:40:36,610
Please, sir!

1322
01:40:40,790 --> 01:40:42,250
Oh my god, I can't.

1323
01:40:42,910 --> 01:40:44,570
Because of you, I have to go back to the chair.

1324
01:40:44,750 --> 01:40:45,250
I hope you're happy.

1325
01:40:45,510 --> 01:40:46,790
I hope you're happy now.

1326
01:40:53,290 --> 01:40:55,490
I think I am taking the hard way up.

1327
01:40:55,530 --> 01:40:57,630
I don't remember how to get up there.

1328
01:41:00,710 --> 01:41:01,910
How do I get up there?

1329
01:41:09,070 --> 01:41:10,710
It must be an easier way, right?

1330
01:41:12,170 --> 01:41:13,210
Hold left.

1331
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:16,930
Oh, here?

1332
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:19,930
Oh, I didn't even see that.

1333
01:41:20,330 --> 01:41:21,730
I didn't realize I existed.

1334
01:41:23,470 --> 01:41:23,810
All right.

1335
01:41:25,630 --> 01:41:26,130

1338
01:41:37,230 --> 01:41:41,750
Oh my god, I almost stepped in it.

1339
01:41:42,810 --> 01:41:43,750
Stepped in the goo.

1340
01:41:46,490 --> 01:41:47,550
Okay, we got this.

1341
01:41:50,070 --> 01:41:51,530
Come on, butterflies.

1342
01:41:54,610 --> 01:41:56,110

1343
01:42:05,050 --> 01:42:06,890

Too many women.

It was just so many women.

1354
01:42:55,260 --> 01:42:56,380

1355
01:42:57,420 --> 01:42:58,000

How is that supposed to know?

1390

01:47:07,450 --> 01:47:10,260
You know absolutely what you're trying to do.

1416
01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:14,180
That's so messed up.

1417
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:15,900

01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:06,820
Dude, there is such a thing as just too many women.

1423
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:09,980
Look, God gave me two hands.

1424
01:48:11,100 --> 01:48:13,080
There's not enough hands to go around.

1425
01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:16,640
The hair of ghost ladies.

1426
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:22,820
I'm sorry, if only I had four hands, guys.

1427
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:23,620
If only.

1428
01:48:25,220 --> 01:48:29,640
But sadly, sadly, I'm very limited.

1429
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:36,080
Too many waifus can sometimes not be good for your life, fool.

1430
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:40,420
I'm so sad.

1431
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:43,240
I'm so sad.

1432
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:47,290

1433
01:48:49,460 --> 01:48:50,980

1435
01:48:52,720 --> 01:48:53,680
Get away.

1436
01:48:55,220 --> 01:48:55,800
No!

1437
01:48:57,960 --> 01:49:00,040
I have to lead her so far.

1438
01:49:03,670 --> 01:49:05,910
Oh my gosh, she's still following me, isn't she?

1439
01:49:10,040 --> 01:49:11,380
Oh my god.

1440
01:49:16,340 --> 01:49:17,540
I can't.

1441
01:49:17,780 --> 01:49:19,260
I can't hit a lady.

1442
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:23,260
Oh my god.

1443
01:49:23,700 --> 01:49:24,300
I can't.

1444
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:31,240
Okay, there you go.

1445
01:49:35,320 --> 01:49:36,580
Oh my god.

1446
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:40,060
Okay.

1447
01:49:41,740 --> 01:49:42,780
Where did it go?

1448
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:44,560
I swear to God.

1449
01:49:46,220 --> 01:49:46,900
Was it up here?

1450
01:49:46,980 --> 01:49:48,360
I swear to God if it was not.

1451
01:49:48,500 --> 01:49:49,020
Okay, thank God.

1452
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:49,580
I was going to say.

1453
01:49:51,260 --> 01:49:52,220
Of course.

1454
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:54,420
Please don't go up.

1455
01:49:54,820 --> 01:49:55,360
They went up.

1456
01:49:59,100 --> 01:50:00,800
I said one.

1457
01:50:01,020 --> 01:50:03,300
I requested one little thing.

1458
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:06,320
Oh, oh, oh my god.

1459
01:50:06,540 --> 01:50:09,600
Oh, I said, don't go up.

1460
01:50:15,790 --> 01:50:18,710
I said, do not go up.

1461
01:50:26,250 --> 01:50:27,930
Okay, I can heal at least.

1462
01:50:31,110 --> 01:50:32,770
I'm not going that way.

1463
01:50:35,250 --> 01:50:38,410
Oh, my, I swear to God, this better be the right way.

1464
01:50:38,950 --> 01:50:39,730
Oh, thank God.

1465
01:50:49,030 --> 01:50:51,010
They're just watching me.

1466
01:50:51,110 --> 01:50:52,510
They know what they're doing.

1467
01:50:53,490 --> 01:50:53,790
That's the...

1468
01:50:53,790 --> 01:50:54,290
That's right.

1469
01:50:54,470 --> 01:50:54,710
Oh, wait.

1470
01:50:54,810 --> 01:50:55,750
I should have not freed him.

1471
01:50:56,030 --> 01:50:58,210
I should have been, like, stay caged forever.

1472
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:06,860
If I enter here and I get sent back to the maze, I swear to God.

1473
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:09,760
I made it.

1474
01:51:09,860 --> 01:51:11,040
No more ghost women.

1475
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:14,920
Thank God.

1476
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:18,060
I am free from the ghost women.

1477
01:51:21,120 --> 01:51:21,740
Oh, there's a bench.

1478
01:51:22,020 --> 01:51:22,780
Oh, guys.

1479
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:25,980
I was like, there's a bench?

1480
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:31,100
Okay, this must be where the bench is.

1481
01:51:31,660 --> 01:51:32,680
Oh, thank God there is.

1482
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:34,900
There actually is.

1483
01:51:37,940 --> 01:51:39,500
Um, Yoki, not every ghost woman.

1484
01:51:46,030 --> 01:51:46,630
Oh!

1485
01:51:48,850 --> 01:51:50,770
Most brutal showers.

1486
01:51:56,830 --> 01:52:00,010
I think this was not the right- I think I should have went down.

1487
01:52:06,450 --> 01:52:07,370
Upward, down.

1488
01:52:08,250 --> 01:52:08,470
Oh?

1489
01:52:09,550 --> 01:52:10,390

01:52:11,110 --> 01:52:11,870

01:52:14,490 --> 01:52:15,690

Can I not be an appreciator of music?

1530
01:55:05,510 --> 01:55:06,590
Apparently not!

1531
01:55:10,250 --> 01:55:12,650

When?

1544
01:56:20,220 --> 01:56:22,940
Oh my god, I don't have any more tools.

1545
01:56:24,060 --> 01:56:25,880
I actually have to fight back.

1546
01:56:30,020 --> 01:56:34,000
I can't believe it, forcing me to fight back.

1547
01:56:37,620 --> 01:56:38,140
Oh shit!

1548
01:56:38,420 --> 01:56:39,280
Oh shit!

1549
01:56:40,040 --> 01:56:41,320
She's so fast!

1550
01:56:47,180 --> 01:56:49,500
Holy fuck, she's fast as fuck.

1551
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:51,540
There we go.

1552
01:56:51,860 --> 01:56:52,220
Twain!

1553
01:56:59,530 --> 01:57:02,870
Like, hitboxes when I land on you, that's not fair!

1554
01:57:04,450 --> 01:57:05,670
You're so skinny!

1555
01:57:07,350 --> 01:57:09,250
That should do zero damage!

1556
01:57:16,680 --> 01:57:17,610
Jesus, what?!

1557
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:19,640
That's illegal!

1558
01:57:21,720 --> 01:57:22,020
When?

1559
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:29,420
I could tell, like, her voice actress must be his, like, Japanese voice actress.

1560
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:31,340
Because, like, I don't know.

1561
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:34,260
I know, she's like, I feel like she's saying Japanese to me.

1562
01:57:44,270 --> 01:57:45,990
Alright, there was nothing I could do.

1563
01:57:46,250 --> 01:57:46,630
That was...

1564
01:57:46,630 --> 01:57:47,070
No!

1565
01:57:47,750 --> 01:57:48,630
I'm so good!

1566
01:57:51,050 --> 01:57:52,450
I got hit.

1567
01:57:56,210 --> 01:57:57,210
Oh my...

1568
01:57:57,210 --> 01:57:59,870
How much HP does she have?

1569
01:58:01,730 --> 01:58:03,010
Holy fuck.

1570
01:58:03,390 --> 01:58:06,490
I swear I was doing so much damage.

1571
01:58:14,140 --> 01:58:17,000
I felt like I did so much damage there.

1572
01:58:17,100 --> 01:58:21,180
I'm so surprised that, like, she still had more.

1573
01:58:21,880 --> 01:58:23,520
She still had more.

1574
01:58:30,540 --> 01:58:32,060
Oh, what?

1575
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:41,160
Get carried with my chainsaw.

1576
01:58:42,420 --> 01:58:43,320
That's right.

1577
01:58:45,880 --> 01:58:48,100
Oh my god, she's actually it.

1578
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:50,240
She's actually it.

1579
01:58:51,420 --> 01:58:52,620
I'm playing you.

1580
01:58:53,620 --> 01:58:54,720
Who would have thought?

1581
01:58:57,540 --> 01:59:00,180

all right also that range is actually so bullshit though like what the fuck was that

1591
02:00:53,420 --> 02:00:55,620
That was actually bullshit.

1592
02:01:02,100 --> 02:01:03,580
That's fucking right.

1593
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:06,640
That's...

1594
02:01:06,640 --> 02:01:07,080
Oh, shit.

1595
02:01:07,200 --> 02:01:08,520
I did not mean to do that, but that's fine.

1596
02:01:10,940 --> 02:01:11,360
That's fine.

1597
02:01:20,390 --> 02:01:21,350
I didn't count.

1598
02:01:21,490 --> 02:01:21,770
Ha-ha.

1599
02:01:22,710 --> 02:01:23,330
Oh, unlucky.

1600
02:01:23,470 --> 02:01:24,190
That counted, though.

1601
02:01:25,510 --> 02:01:25,890
It's fine.

1602
02:01:26,470 --> 02:01:27,530
I had quick here.

1603
02:01:30,870 --> 02:01:31,970
That's right!

1604
02:01:33,610 --> 02:01:35,590
I had quick here!

1605
02:01:37,210 --> 02:01:37,690
Chaser!

1606
02:01:38,690 --> 02:01:39,490
Okay, Chaser!

1607
02:01:39,790 --> 02:01:40,710

1608
02:01:43,410 --> 02:01:43,730
Chaser!

1609
02:01:44,830 --> 02:01:45,850

1611
02:01:50,610 --> 02:01:51,110
Oh my god!

1612
02:01:52,290 --> 02:01:56,170
Oh thank goodness I did it.

1613
02:01:57,230 --> 02:01:57,470
Okay.

1614
02:01:58,090 --> 02:01:59,810
Oh thank goodness I did.

1615
02:01:59,810 --> 02:02:00,530
I hate this.

1616
02:02:00,930 --> 02:02:02,090

1617
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:05,480
this.

1618
02:02:05,500 --> 02:02:08,160
I need to keep hitting her, though.

1619
02:02:11,620 --> 02:02:11,860
Okay.

1620
02:02:13,580 --> 02:02:13,780

1621
02:02:20,790 --> 02:02:21,010
Oh!

1622
02:02:21,590 --> 02:02:24,730
I thought she'd jump away!

1623
02:02:25,790 --> 02:02:26,090
All right.

1624
02:02:26,230 --> 02:02:26,690
That's it.

1625
02:02:26,710 --> 02:02:28,030
I'm locking in for real.

1626
02:02:28,930 --> 02:02:32,650
I know I said that like three other times, but for real this time.

1627
02:02:35,710 --> 02:02:37,250
I'm focusing up.

1628
02:02:38,370 --> 02:02:40,390
She pissed off the wrong bug.

1629
02:02:44,910 --> 02:02:46,310
For real for real

1630
02:02:49,750 --> 02:03:11,790

Oh, my God.

1634
02:03:31,160 --> 02:03:32,280
Arrange for that sometimes.

1635
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:33,280
When?

1636
02:03:42,420 --> 02:03:43,140
That's fine.

1637
02:03:46,900 --> 02:03:47,620
Alright.

1638
02:03:48,260 --> 02:03:48,600
Alright.

1639
02:03:49,780 --> 02:03:50,880
Why are you parrying?

1640
02:03:52,380 --> 02:03:53,760
Ha ha ha ha.

1641
02:03:54,220 --> 02:04:05,520

1643
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:37,220
Unfortunately, I've lost all chainsaw.

1644
02:04:43,580 --> 02:04:45,500
Her parry shit is so annoying.

1645
02:04:48,100 --> 02:04:48,840
Oh, no, she mad.

1646
02:04:49,100 --> 02:04:49,340
No!

1647
02:04:49,980 --> 02:04:50,840
She's so mad.

1648
02:04:59,930 --> 02:05:01,250
There we go.

1649
02:05:03,930 --> 02:05:06,850
Have you thought about not being mad?

1650
02:05:07,750 --> 02:05:09,150
I know, it's crazy.

1651
02:05:11,690 --> 02:05:14,090
Oh my god, oh my god, she jumped too.

1652
02:05:25,580 --> 02:05:26,580
That's fine.

1653
02:05:31,420 --> 02:05:31,920
Alright.

1654
02:05:33,080 --> 02:05:33,760
Oh, I was scared.

1655
02:05:33,900 --> 02:05:35,580
I thought she was gonna parry.

1656
02:05:43,070 --> 02:05:44,290
That's fucking right!

1657
02:05:50,010 --> 02:05:50,510
Stop!

1658
02:05:51,070 --> 02:05:51,430
No!

1659
02:05:56,580 --> 02:05:58,540
All I asked was you to stop.

1660
02:06:02,530 --> 02:06:04,190
I don't ask for much.

1661
02:06:08,780 --> 02:06:09,580
Okay.

1662
02:06:11,640 --> 02:06:12,660
Oh, thank god.

1663
02:06:13,080 --> 02:06:14,180
Get out of here!

1664
02:06:15,740 --> 02:06:16,040
RB.

1665
02:06:17,120 --> 02:06:18,560
That's fucking right.

1666
02:06:26,460 --> 02:06:27,620
Parry this.

1667
02:06:29,880 --> 02:06:31,680
I finally did it.

1668
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:37,280
Bind silk around the needle and instantly strike back.

1669
02:06:37,500 --> 02:06:38,120
Silk skills?

1670
02:06:38,740 --> 02:06:39,840
Okay, how do I do this?

1671
02:06:43,410 --> 02:06:44,210
Alright.

1672
02:06:45,210 --> 02:06:47,990
Wait, I have to parry myself?

1673
02:06:49,110 --> 02:06:52,130
I thought if I just press this and it's just...

1674
02:06:52,130 --> 02:06:55,050
Wait, I have to parry...

1675
02:06:55,050 --> 02:06:58,990
Do you mean I have to parry?

1676
02:06:59,390 --> 02:07:02,110
Press a different button?

1677
02:07:03,690 --> 02:07:04,170
Oh!

1678
02:07:05,490 --> 02:07:08,070
I was like, wow, they opened the hole for me.

1679
02:07:08,990 --> 02:07:09,310
Nice.

1680
02:07:13,590 --> 02:07:14,930
I have to leave it.

1681
02:07:15,010 --> 02:07:16,370
I thought if I just pressed this.

1682
02:07:17,190 --> 02:07:29,850
and then it'll give me the it'll give me the thing i didn't realize i have to press a different button so how did i do it i just wait

Am I a gamer?

Okay, never mind.

1692
02:09:14,780 --> 02:09:15,240
Never mind.

1693
02:09:15,480 --> 02:09:15,920
This is good.

1694
02:09:16,080 --> 02:09:17,120
This is a good weapon.

1695
02:09:17,280 --> 02:09:17,760
Never mind.

1696
02:09:17,880 --> 02:09:18,820
I take it all back.

1697
02:09:19,940 --> 02:09:23,480
Yeah, I thought it had to time it correctly or some shit.

1698
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:25,120
But it's actually pretty good.

1699
02:09:26,900 --> 02:09:28,160
Okay, now where do we go?

1700
02:09:28,380 --> 02:09:29,480
Okay, we got all of that.

1701
02:09:30,600 --> 02:09:31,700
Get another nail upgrade?

1702
02:09:31,880 --> 02:09:33,340
Do you think it's worth it?

1703
02:09:38,980 --> 02:09:40,720
Pass the memory locket?

1704
02:09:41,580 --> 02:09:41,940
No.

1705
02:09:44,680 --> 02:09:46,080
No, don't say that.

1706
02:09:46,480 --> 02:09:48,540
I don't want to go back.

1707
02:09:49,380 --> 02:09:51,440
Don't take me back to...

1708
02:09:51,440 --> 02:09:52,060
No!

1709
02:09:57,340 --> 02:10:00,200
No, don't take me back.

1710
02:10:04,240 --> 02:10:06,040
Don't do this to me.

1711
02:10:08,020 --> 02:10:09,640
Don't do this.

1712
02:10:10,840 --> 02:10:12,680
Just climb up and go left.

1713
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:15,360
For what?

1714
02:10:19,580 --> 02:10:21,900
Don't take me back to Cinder's Road.

1715
02:10:23,580 --> 02:10:24,860
It's just above me?

1716
02:10:25,640 --> 02:10:25,800
What?

1717
02:10:25,980 --> 02:10:26,260
Oh.

1718
02:10:35,570 --> 02:10:36,210
Here.

1719
02:10:36,410 --> 02:10:36,890
Oh, here.

1720
02:10:37,070 --> 02:10:37,390
Okay.

1721
02:10:38,350 --> 02:10:39,310
Oh, there it is.

1722
02:10:41,050 --> 02:10:42,270
Oh, thank God.

1723
02:10:43,030 --> 02:10:43,910
Oh, thank God.

1724
02:10:45,770 --> 02:10:47,050
Don't take me back there.

1725
02:10:47,690 --> 02:10:49,810
Don't take me back to the elephant graveyard.

1726
02:10:52,450 --> 02:10:53,090
I was lied to.

1727
02:10:53,210 --> 02:10:55,670
Mufasa did not come over and save me.

1728
02:10:57,590 --> 02:10:59,670
Wait, we need to unlock our crest.

1729
02:11:01,270 --> 02:11:02,510
Uh, we'll just do the one request.

1730
02:11:03,550 --> 02:11:03,870
Okay.

1731
02:11:07,830 --> 02:11:08,390
Alright.

1732
02:11:09,590 --> 02:11:12,270
I need to go pee.

1733
02:11:12,330 --> 02:11:12,910
I'll be on my back.

1734
02:11:13,630 --> 02:11:14,910
You need to watch Hornets sit down.

1735
02:14:14,790 --> 02:14:15,830
I'm back.

1736
02:14:16,790 --> 02:14:18,990

02:14:19,290 --> 02:14:20,450

1767
02:16:50,440 --> 02:16:53,000
What is the easiest one?

1768
02:16:53,260 --> 02:16:53,580
All right.

1769
02:16:53,980 --> 02:16:55,000
Which one's the easiest?

1770
02:16:57,180 --> 02:16:59,360
In the bargaining phase.

1771
02:17:02,080 --> 02:17:02,960
All right.

1772
02:17:05,220 --> 02:17:06,340
Mossberry stew.

1773
02:17:06,780 --> 02:17:07,100
All right.

1774
02:17:07,340 --> 02:17:08,800
That has to be in the moss home.

1775
02:17:15,470 --> 02:17:17,010
Oh, talk to that moss lady.

1776
02:17:17,470 --> 02:17:18,590
Where does she live again?

1777
02:17:18,670 --> 02:17:19,650
It's been so long.

1778
02:17:21,890 --> 02:17:23,290
know where she lives

1779
02:17:26,680 --> 02:17:35,980
top bench oh here that's where she lived okay uh aida aida

1780
02:17:40,760 --> 02:18:00,040
the pickle muck maggot is from a boss in cinder road the boss sucks okay we'll leave that for last well we'll leave that for last then oh hi oh whoops

1781
02:18:10,450 --> 02:18:11,710
Oh, yeah.

1782
02:18:12,250 --> 02:18:13,950
Oh, I should have went to the bone area.

1783
02:18:19,390 --> 02:18:19,830
Alright.

1784
02:18:21,430 --> 02:18:22,330
It'll be worth it.

1785
02:18:22,390 --> 02:18:24,110
This is my long-term investment.

1786
02:18:25,250 --> 02:18:28,450
It'll make the entire run so much easier, I think.

1787
02:18:29,490 --> 02:18:30,970
I'm not doing plus two.

1788
02:18:31,030 --> 02:18:31,710
Not again.

1789
02:18:32,630 --> 02:18:36,510
I'm making sure I'm not beating this game with plus two nail damage.

1790
02:18:36,850 --> 02:18:37,730
Never again.

1791
02:18:38,210 --> 02:18:38,690
Never.

1792
02:18:39,170 --> 02:18:40,970
Never again!

1793
02:18:49,910 --> 02:18:50,410
Oh yeah.

1794
02:18:55,700 --> 02:18:56,500
It's this way.

1795
02:19:01,600 --> 02:19:03,860
I've learned from my lesson.

1796
02:19:04,940 --> 02:19:06,540
Oh my god, they're so easy to kill now.

1797
02:19:06,960 --> 02:19:07,300
Good.

1798
02:19:11,800 --> 02:19:13,640
I will get that out of the way.

1799
02:19:14,980 --> 02:19:16,800
Hello, I required a suit.

1800
02:19:18,420 --> 02:19:20,660
A gourmand of the Citadel.

1801
02:19:20,900 --> 02:19:22,100
Would you pass them to me?

1802
02:19:22,600 --> 02:19:24,620
A bud who comes through my berry brew.

1803
02:19:24,960 --> 02:19:26,760
Strong, they need to taste so sharp.

1804
02:19:27,060 --> 02:19:29,060
Here is the flavor so ripe.

1805
02:19:29,340 --> 02:19:31,600
Searing, flavor, pleasure, and pain.

1806
02:19:31,920 --> 02:19:35,060
They too may see the visions if they taste is strong.

1807
02:19:35,360 --> 02:19:36,500
The visions could they see?

1808
02:19:36,940 --> 02:19:38,400
Grab the stew for your bug.

1809
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:39,900
To share the vision.

1810
02:19:40,220 --> 02:19:41,440
Yes, we shall pass it.

1811
02:19:41,500 --> 02:19:42,160
Yay, all right.

1812
02:19:42,320 --> 02:19:43,620
Next ingredient.

1813
02:19:44,380 --> 02:19:44,980
Which one?

1814
02:19:52,940 --> 02:19:54,060
What do we do next?

1815
02:19:57,080 --> 02:20:06,400

1819
02:21:11,080 --> 02:21:12,080
Uh, Greenmoor.

02:21:17,440 --> 02:21:18,180
Like, hold it.

1821
02:21:18,200 --> 02:21:19,380
That's half a bread.

1822
02:21:20,540 --> 02:21:23,460
You're a bar, not a Michelin star restaurant.

1823
02:21:26,020 --> 02:21:27,140
It's like...

1824
02:21:27,140 --> 02:21:28,780
Actually, crazy.

1825
02:21:29,820 --> 02:21:32,020
I feel like I'm getting robbed right now.

1826
02:21:34,440 --> 02:21:38,840

02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:09,260

1829
02:22:09,260 --> 02:22:10,600
No, no touchy.

1830
02:22:11,020 --> 02:22:12,000
No touchy.

1831
02:22:13,680 --> 02:22:15,060
Back off!

1832
02:22:17,020 --> 02:22:18,640
That's right.

1833
02:22:21,020 --> 02:22:23,580
The forbidden taste.

1834
02:22:24,400 --> 02:22:26,340
No understands, ma.

1835
02:22:26,920 --> 02:22:35,620
The sap of such a fierce petted juices will be the vine, but it's not right to do such...

1836
02:22:35,620 --> 02:22:36,000
Yes!

1837

1839
02:23:11,330 --> 02:23:13,670
I will.

1840
02:23:14,350 --> 02:23:17,050
Knowing your creature's form and habits is an advantage.

1841
02:23:17,590 --> 02:23:19,330
That can decide the outcome of a battle.

1842
02:23:19,830 --> 02:23:21,810
Recording these details is worth the effort.

1843
02:23:22,570 --> 02:23:23,210
Oh, yes.

1844
02:23:23,450 --> 02:23:24,850
It is very much worth it.

1845
02:23:25,090 --> 02:23:27,430
Me hopes you will share your new learnings with her often.

1846
02:23:27,930 --> 02:23:30,050
And take a gift to help with your hunting, Miss Growing Up.

1847
02:23:30,290 --> 02:23:34,370
Me will add a pocket to your tool punch with a bring of many tools on your hand.

1848
02:23:34,570 --> 02:23:36,110
Alright, my thing expanded.

02:23:38,930 --> 02:24:09,690

1850
02:24:10,190 --> 02:24:12,450
Bontana and Batastacquired Nectar significant age.

1851
02:24:12,810 --> 02:24:14,170
Will you chain any such drink?

1852
02:24:14,850 --> 02:24:16,690
After the fodder stuff, eh?

1853
02:24:17,170 --> 02:24:17,470
Sure.

1854
02:24:17,730 --> 02:24:20,550
I might have a few vessels left, but I can't be selling them cheap.

1855
02:24:21,030 --> 02:24:23,850
The shells in my cellar the last left in Farlum.

1856
02:24:24,310 --> 02:24:27,950
Once they're gone, no bug ever tastes such sweetness again.

1857
02:24:28,370 --> 02:24:29,430
Alright, vintage nectar.

1858
02:24:30,990 --> 02:24:31,890
There you go.

1859
02:24:32,230 --> 02:24:32,490
Hi.

1860
02:24:32,730 --> 02:24:33,610
A fair trade.

1861
02:24:33,910 --> 02:24:35,930
The age stuffed down the bottom of the cellar.

1862
02:24:36,290 --> 02:24:39,110
I'll trust you to collect only the vessel you own.

1863
02:24:39,550 --> 02:24:40,710
I'll be grabbing it myself.

1864
02:24:41,090 --> 02:24:44,110
It's become a hard... I have to get it myself?

1865
02:24:46,330 --> 02:24:47,290
Are you...

1866
02:24:47,830 --> 02:24:56,850
Okay, I assume with the $480 fee that I don't have to also grab for it too, but I... Oh my God, this is a boss fight.

1867
02:24:57,230 --> 02:24:58,530
This is a fucking boss fight.

1868
02:24:58,630 --> 02:24:59,190
Give me a sec.

1869
02:25:02,970 --> 02:25:04,770
I bet it's a giant rat.

1870
02:25:05,130 --> 02:25:06,930
It's a giant rat, isn't it?

1871
02:25:07,190 --> 02:25:32,690
It's a fucking i i can tell i can feel it in my bones i can he i can feel it i this gives me oh it's a giant rat isn't it isn't it guys why are there so many rats down here why are is there so many rats down there oh my god there it is

1872
02:25:37,590 --> 02:25:38,650
Sad, Brad.

1873
02:25:41,410 --> 02:25:42,390
Oh my god, it's just ants.

1874
02:25:42,530 --> 02:25:43,090
Okay, that's fine.

1875
02:25:43,290 --> 02:25:43,910
It's just...

1876
02:25:43,910 --> 02:25:44,650
Can I just leave?

1877
02:25:46,630 --> 02:25:48,310
What if I just leave?

1878
02:25:55,160 --> 02:25:56,820
You locked the door.

1879
02:25:57,200 --> 02:25:58,760
You locked the door.

1880
02:25:59,260 --> 02:25:59,760
You...

1881
02:25:59,760 --> 02:26:01,020
He locked the door.

1882
02:26:03,480 --> 02:26:05,980
He locked the door.

1883
02:26:05,980 --> 02:26:07,960
He actually locked the door.

1884
02:26:08,560 --> 02:26:10,160
That's so fucked up.

1885
02:26:12,460 --> 02:26:13,900
actually locked.

1886
02:26:16,880 --> 02:26:18,900
What is wrong with you?

1887
02:26:27,140 --> 02:26:28,460
Oh my god.

1888
02:26:28,740 --> 02:26:29,820
What is wrong with them?

1889
02:26:32,180 --> 02:26:33,820
Why would you lock the door?

1890
02:26:39,270 --> 02:26:42,870
The bartender is not a good person.

1891
02:26:44,050 --> 02:26:46,810
Yeah, yeah, I'm starting to believe that.

1892
02:26:48,770 --> 02:26:50,610
Just in a pre-pest case.

1893
02:26:51,770 --> 02:26:54,070
I have to pay $480.

1894
02:26:54,930 --> 02:26:57,790
I was also free test control, too.

1895
02:27:04,710 --> 02:27:06,090
Like this.

1896
02:27:08,010 --> 02:27:09,050
There we go.

1897
02:27:11,270 --> 02:27:11,830
There we go.

1898
02:27:12,070 --> 02:27:12,670
They're all dead.

1899
02:27:13,890 --> 02:27:13,910
Oh.

1900
02:27:14,690 --> 02:27:15,670
Guess not.

1901
02:27:18,770 --> 02:27:19,790
Oh, shit.

1902
02:27:24,730 --> 02:27:26,590
I forgot about this guy.

1903
02:27:29,150 --> 02:27:31,790
Guys, this might be a bad idea to...

1904
02:27:32,310 --> 02:27:33,450
The bee hit up.

1905
02:27:33,850 --> 02:27:37,850
Guys, I might have messed up by being in the corner of that.

1906
02:27:40,370 --> 02:27:41,310
Surely he won't jump down, right?

1907
02:27:41,690 --> 02:27:42,230
No, he's not.

1908
02:27:42,690 --> 02:27:43,070
Thank God.

1909
02:27:43,230 --> 02:27:43,350
Okay.

1910
02:27:44,510 --> 02:27:45,890
I was a little worried.

1911
02:27:56,460 --> 02:27:56,960
Fuck this.

1912
02:27:57,060 --> 02:27:58,160
I cannot be bothered.

1913
02:27:59,160 --> 02:28:01,120
I cannot be...

1914
02:28:02,980 --> 02:28:04,300
Wait, he crawled back down.

1915
02:28:04,340 --> 02:28:04,660
Okay, watch.

1916
02:28:04,880 --> 02:28:06,880
Oh, I got it.

1917
02:28:06,880 --> 02:28:07,480
I got it.

1918
02:28:07,880 --> 02:28:08,890
I got it.

1919
02:28:15,840 --> 02:28:18,300
Okay, I remember how to kill this guy.

1920
02:28:21,860 --> 02:28:22,430
There we go.

1921
02:28:26,630 --> 02:28:27,320
It's fine.

1922
02:28:27,840 --> 02:28:28,500
Boomerang!

1923
02:28:29,500 --> 02:28:30,240
Boomerang!

1924
02:28:31,530 --> 02:28:32,500
There we go.

1925
02:28:36,980 --> 02:28:37,660
There we go.

1926
02:28:38,080 --> 02:28:38,750
We did it.

1927
02:28:39,480 --> 02:28:40,360
God damn it.

1928
02:28:41,460 --> 02:28:42,420
Open up.

1929
02:28:42,440 --> 02:28:43,600
the door, Barkeep.

1930
02:28:43,980 --> 02:28:45,220
Open up the door.

1931
02:28:45,560 --> 02:28:47,500
I just want to talk to you.

1932
02:28:47,860 --> 02:28:52,120
I just want to calmly talk to you.

1933
02:28:57,380 --> 02:28:58,780
Alright, here's the next day.

1934
02:29:02,310 --> 02:29:03,850
I got the wish.

1935
02:29:05,310 --> 02:29:09,030
I just want to very calmly talk to you, Mr. Barkeep.

1936
02:29:10,430 --> 02:29:12,330
Open the damn door.

1937
02:29:16,310 --> 02:29:17,250
So what was that?

1938
02:29:17,690 --> 02:29:18,730
What was that?

1939
02:29:19,530 --> 02:29:22,490
Oh, you heard a little commotion.

1940
02:29:23,190 --> 02:29:24,290
Yeah, very little.

1941
02:29:24,970 --> 02:29:27,830
I trust everything went smoothly.

1942
02:29:28,630 --> 02:29:30,150
Sir, your seller seems to have an app.

1943
02:29:30,410 --> 02:29:31,930
Oh, yeah, just a little app problem.

1944
02:29:32,410 --> 02:29:33,230
I assume you sent me that.

1945
02:29:33,430 --> 02:29:35,250
It merely slipped your mind to mention.

1946
02:29:35,430 --> 02:29:36,450
Oh, yes.

1947
02:29:36,630 --> 02:29:39,930
Well, with your weapon and talent and what, I'm sure it didn't pose a problem.

1948
02:29:40,290 --> 02:29:41,850
And why, I see you collecting your prize.

1949
02:29:42,130 --> 02:29:42,890
So we both came up.

1950
02:29:43,030 --> 02:29:44,350
I paid for this.

1951
02:29:45,850 --> 02:29:48,590
Trading required means that I get something in return.

1952
02:29:48,750 --> 02:29:51,130
I paid for this.

1953
02:29:52,150 --> 02:29:52,890
Enjoy your next game, Miss.

1954
02:29:52,990 --> 02:29:54,670
No simple pilgrim, whatever tastes and draws.

1955
02:29:54,870 --> 02:29:56,010
I don't even get to drink it.

1956
02:29:56,310 --> 02:29:56,930
I don't even...

1957
02:29:56,930 --> 02:29:58,430
Oh my gosh, I could just kill you.

1958
02:29:58,650 --> 02:29:59,570
I don't even care.

1959
02:30:00,730 --> 02:30:01,550
Oh, and then he...

1960
02:30:01,550 --> 02:30:02,790
I have $10 left.

1961
02:30:02,910 --> 02:30:05,110
He's like, how about you drink a little more nectar?

1962
02:30:08,570 --> 02:30:10,470
Where is the memory locket?

1963
02:30:10,970 --> 02:30:11,990
Where is it?

1964
02:30:15,710 --> 02:30:16,590
Top left?

1965
02:30:17,750 --> 02:30:18,830
Oh, there it is.

1966
02:30:20,250 --> 02:30:21,530
There it is.

1967
02:30:22,070 --> 02:30:23,690
I needed this anyway.

1968
02:30:26,970 --> 02:30:27,630
Alright.

1969
02:30:28,310 --> 02:30:29,310
We gotta unlock another.

1970
02:30:29,910 --> 02:30:30,150
Whoops.

1971
02:30:31,990 --> 02:30:33,670
I'll just keep unlocking the one-ner-one.

1972
02:30:34,270 --> 02:30:34,750
Just in order.

1973
02:30:34,830 --> 02:30:35,830
This is like emergency.

1974
02:30:39,860 --> 02:30:40,240
Alright.

1975
02:30:42,340 --> 02:30:42,620
Wait.

1976
02:30:42,780 --> 02:30:44,420
Have I unlocked enough to...

1977
02:30:44,420 --> 02:30:46,920
Guys, have I unlocked enough memory locket?

1978
02:30:47,880 --> 02:30:48,540
Uh...

1979
02:30:49,360 --> 02:30:50,020
To...

1980
02:30:50,020 --> 02:30:51,600
To do the upgrade thing?

1981
02:30:53,460 --> 02:30:55,020
I don't even know if I'm 9.

1982
02:30:55,300 --> 02:30:55,940
I don't know.

1983
02:30:58,400 --> 02:30:59,180
Don't know.

1984
02:31:00,120 --> 02:31:00,960
Okay, I have this.

1985
02:31:01,960 --> 02:31:02,820
I have this.

1986
02:31:04,560 --> 02:31:04,920
Oh, wait.

1987
02:31:04,980 --> 02:31:05,760
I can't lock one more.

1988
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:06,740
Wait, I have... Whoa.

1989
02:31:06,980 --> 02:31:07,660
I didn't even realize.

1990
02:31:10,360 --> 02:31:11,220
Wait, alright.

1991
02:31:11,940 --> 02:31:13,500
Reaper 1 here.

1992
02:31:15,120 --> 02:31:16,380
We'll do it.

1993
02:31:16,440 --> 02:31:18,560
We'll do the Reaper 1.

1994
02:31:24,740 --> 02:31:26,020
Oh, I need quest.

1995
02:31:26,040 --> 02:31:27,220
Let's not lock it.

1996
02:31:29,480 --> 02:31:30,780
I don't know if I have.

1997
02:31:31,540 --> 02:31:32,440
One, two, three.

1998
02:31:32,540 --> 02:31:33,520
Wait, where's the last one?

1999
02:31:33,600 --> 02:31:34,060
Oh, whatever.

2000
02:31:34,140 --> 02:31:35,140
We don't have to worry about that.

2001
02:31:35,300 --> 02:31:36,400
I'm focusing on the nail.

2002
02:31:36,660 --> 02:31:37,420
One at a time.

2003
02:31:37,800 --> 02:31:38,520
Nail first.

2004
02:31:38,960 --> 02:31:39,820
Nail first.

2005
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:46,500
All right.

2006
02:31:47,160 --> 02:31:48,420
Where's the next one?

2007
02:31:57,290 --> 02:31:59,770
It's a combination of total slots, I believe.

2008
02:32:01,070 --> 02:32:01,830
Total slots.

2009
02:32:01,990 --> 02:32:02,350
All right.

2010
02:32:06,860 --> 02:32:09,300
I can replenish weapons without bench.

2011
02:32:09,520 --> 02:32:10,300
So technically...

2012
02:32:10,320 --> 02:32:10,940
Unlimit.

2013
02:32:11,060 --> 02:32:11,840
No, we don't need that.

2014
02:32:12,920 --> 02:32:13,560
No, no, no, no.

2015
02:32:14,440 --> 02:32:14,940
No, no, no.

2016
02:32:15,340 --> 02:32:17,380
Next one, that's not Sinner's Road.

2017
02:32:20,720 --> 02:32:22,180
Which one's the easiest?

2018
02:32:26,760 --> 02:32:30,020
Which one is the easiest?

2019
02:32:33,420 --> 02:32:34,300
Blasted steps.

2020
02:32:34,500 --> 02:32:39,680
Okay, but is blasted steps easier than Sinner's?

2021
02:32:40,320 --> 02:32:41,860
Sinner is the easiest.

2022
02:32:42,340 --> 02:32:42,340
Alright.

2023
02:32:43,060 --> 02:32:44,120
I guess I...

2024
02:32:44,120 --> 02:32:45,620
I guess I die then.

2025
02:32:46,640 --> 02:32:49,720
I thought I would never return to the elephant graveyard.

2026
02:32:50,560 --> 02:32:51,760
But I was wrong.

2027
02:32:57,760 --> 02:33:00,500
I thought I never had to come back here.

2028
02:33:02,800 --> 02:33:04,200
One last ride.

2029
02:33:04,600 --> 02:33:05,560
You son of a bitch.

2030
02:33:05,680 --> 02:33:06,400
I'm in.

2031
02:33:10,370 --> 02:33:12,130
One last ride.

2032
02:33:13,130 --> 02:33:15,070
I gotta go back to my prison break arc.

2033
02:33:16,230 --> 02:33:22,010
Like prison break when they left prison after prison break to break to break out again.

2034
02:33:22,310 --> 02:33:35,310
This is me I thought I was I was so surprised that like, you know after they broke out of prison they the show still continued I was like what more can you do you're out of jail

2035
02:33:38,650 --> 02:33:42,850
All right Where do we go?

2036
02:33:46,230 --> 02:34:05,440
but where do we go first down okay yeah we're going back in but okay we'll get the bench but here right all right just gotta know

2037
02:34:09,790 --> 02:34:24,230
no no no not again no I accidentally read my map instead I saw I just started reading my map.

2038
02:34:27,400 --> 02:34:28,600
Go down.

2039
02:34:36,540 --> 02:34:37,400
That's fine.

2040
02:34:38,920 --> 02:34:40,400
Oh god, that is not fine!

2041
02:34:40,840 --> 02:34:42,120
That is not fine!

2042
02:34:54,190 --> 02:34:56,190
Wait, how come I...

02:34:56,190 --> 02:34:57,690

02:35:09,090 --> 02:35:10,030

What?

2054
02:36:04,310 --> 02:36:05,750
Oh, it's my invulnerability.

2055
02:36:06,210 --> 02:36:07,630
There you go.

2056
02:36:09,630 --> 02:36:10,250
Actually...

2057
02:36:11,270 --> 02:36:14,370
Oh my god, I didn't mean to do that.

2058
02:36:18,430 --> 02:36:19,050
Oh

2059
02:36:22,140 --> 02:36:24,220
my god, she's using her booty!

2060
02:36:24,760 --> 02:36:27,260
That's a big, beautiful bug they warned me about!

2061
02:36:27,840 --> 02:36:28,800
Mono, mono!

2062
02:36:30,960 --> 02:36:32,260
Holy shit!

2063
02:36:32,540 --> 02:36:34,600
She slapped me with her ass!

2064
02:36:35,320 --> 02:36:37,240
She's throwing it back!

2065
02:36:39,220 --> 02:36:41,100
Okay, I was not expecting...

2066
02:36:41,100 --> 02:36:41,780
I was...

2067
02:36:41,780 --> 02:36:43,180
To be fair...

2068
02:36:43,180 --> 02:36:47,200
I was not expecting her to smack me with her fucking ass.

2069
02:36:48,020 --> 02:36:51,200
I don't think anybody expected that.

2070
02:36:52,500 --> 02:36:56,000
I don't think no one expected that to happen.

2071
02:37:02,770 --> 02:37:04,810
I was not ready.

2072
02:37:04,830 --> 02:37:06,490
for a sickness.

2073
02:37:11,810 --> 02:37:13,970
Gong, gong!

2074
02:37:14,470 --> 02:37:16,110
Send me the BBB!

2075
02:37:17,470 --> 02:37:19,290
I paid extra.

2076
02:37:20,570 --> 02:37:24,170
You know what?

2077
02:37:24,730 --> 02:37:26,290
Yeah, I just went...

2078
02:37:30,920 --> 02:37:31,860
There we go.

2079
02:37:31,980 --> 02:37:33,460
I paid extra for this.

2080
02:37:33,900 --> 02:37:35,100
Big, beautiful bug.

2081
02:37:35,740 --> 02:37:37,420
Can I bury her ass?

2082
02:37:38,040 --> 02:37:39,500
Wait, let's find out.

2083
02:37:41,100 --> 02:37:42,400
Oh wait, okay, let's find out.

2084
02:37:43,860 --> 02:37:45,760
Okay, that wasn't her ass, but like...

2085
02:37:47,660 --> 02:37:50,460
Oh my god, stupid maggots.

2086
02:37:51,840 --> 02:37:52,360
That's it!

2087
02:37:52,640 --> 02:37:53,100
That's it!

2088
02:37:54,300 --> 02:37:56,980
I don't think this is a winnable round.

2089
02:37:58,920 --> 02:37:59,760
No, this is definitely...

2090
02:38:00,420 --> 02:38:01,980
This is definitely not winnable.

2091
02:38:04,780 --> 02:38:05,340
Alright.

2092
02:38:06,620 --> 02:38:07,620
Can I...

2093
02:38:08,760 --> 02:38:10,740
Wait, I can parry your ass?

2094
02:38:10,880 --> 02:38:11,460
Alright, let's try.

2095
02:38:11,460 --> 02:38:12,520
I want to try that.

2096
02:38:15,760 --> 02:38:17,180
I'm going to do it.

2097
02:38:19,540 --> 02:38:21,940
I'm going to parry that BBB.

2098
02:38:28,990 --> 02:38:29,410
Oh, that's good.

2099
02:38:29,450 --> 02:38:30,430
I should need these shards.

2100
02:38:35,730 --> 02:38:37,570
I can parry everything.

2101
02:38:39,070 --> 02:38:40,690
Gun, gun, gun.

2102
02:38:41,290 --> 02:38:42,070
That's right.

2103
02:38:42,490 --> 02:38:44,730
I want more of that big booty.

2104
02:38:48,890 --> 02:38:50,390
Oops, I did not mean...

2105
02:38:50,390 --> 02:38:50,990
Are you serious?

2106
02:38:51,150 --> 02:38:52,310
I didn't mean to throw that stuff.

2107
02:38:53,250 --> 02:38:55,110
That was actually an accident.

2108
02:38:59,870 --> 02:39:00,650
Alright, I'm ready.

2109
02:39:01,530 --> 02:39:02,410
Send in the booty!

2110
02:39:05,910 --> 02:39:08,010
Oh, I guess I wasn't ready.

2111
02:39:11,730 --> 02:39:12,170
JK.

2112
02:39:15,290 --> 02:39:16,630
Not ready in the end.

2113
02:39:17,010 --> 02:39:18,170
Oh my god.

2114
02:39:21,690 --> 02:39:23,170
Oh, these guys are so...

2115
02:39:23,170 --> 02:39:24,770
Can you, like, reflect that?

2116
02:39:27,550 --> 02:39:30,070
Like, if I hit it, is it reflectable?

2117
02:39:33,890 --> 02:39:34,410
Barely.

2118
02:39:40,310 --> 02:39:40,830
What?

2119
02:39:41,470 --> 02:39:42,770
About rid of it.

2120
02:39:47,030 --> 02:39:47,890
Jesus, they're so...

2121
02:39:47,910 --> 02:39:48,650
So annoying.

2122
02:39:56,310 --> 02:39:58,310
Okay, I understand the pattern.

2123
02:40:03,150 --> 02:40:08,050
Okay, I did understand the pattern.

2124
02:40:08,730 --> 02:40:10,210
I liked it.

2125
02:40:12,930 --> 02:40:15,850
Okay, I think...

2126
02:40:15,850 --> 02:40:18,430
I'm thinking that I should keep...

2127
02:40:18,430 --> 02:40:23,030
Okay, I feel like since I'm going to change crest, I think I'll need it.

2128
02:40:23,210 --> 02:40:25,210
I think I'll need it for the...

2129
02:40:26,570 --> 02:40:27,210
Actually...

2130
02:40:27,210 --> 02:40:29,210
I'm thinking...

2131
02:40:31,090 --> 02:40:33,550
I'm thinking I should keep with the hunter.

2132
02:40:35,270 --> 02:40:37,350
Or keep with the parry.

2133
02:40:38,230 --> 02:40:38,990
I'm gonna do Adidas.

2134
02:40:39,970 --> 02:40:41,270
I think Adidas would be better.

2135
02:40:44,150 --> 02:40:44,690
Adidas!

2136
02:40:47,610 --> 02:40:49,250
Hunter crest is good here.

2137
02:40:49,850 --> 02:40:50,410
Is it?

2138
02:40:53,210 --> 02:40:54,470
Okay, I'll do it.

2139
02:40:54,490 --> 02:40:55,930
I'll keep the Adidas.

2140
02:40:57,890 --> 02:40:59,010
I think Adidas would work better.

2141
02:41:06,570 --> 02:41:08,190
I didn't need that silk.

2142
02:41:08,570 --> 02:41:09,350
I did it anyway.

2143
02:41:13,680 --> 02:41:14,280
Guys, I'm sorry.

2144
02:41:14,700 --> 02:41:18,340
I know you all want me to parry that booty, but it's too much.

2145
02:41:18,680 --> 02:41:20,460
Her booty is simply too thick.

2146
02:41:23,500 --> 02:41:25,020
It was just not meant to be.

2147
02:41:29,430 --> 02:41:31,290
The booty was just so thick, guys.

2148
02:41:31,470 --> 02:41:32,230
It was crazy.

2149
02:41:34,350 --> 02:41:35,230
There we go.

2150
02:41:44,900 --> 02:41:45,340
Okay.

2151
02:41:45,980 --> 02:41:46,420
Okay.

2152
02:41:49,100 --> 02:41:50,720
I got a little tooth.

2153
02:41:52,560 --> 02:41:52,980
Oh, my God.

2154
02:41:53,140 --> 02:41:53,640
I can't help it.

2155
02:41:53,860 --> 02:41:55,080
Guys, I can't help it.

2156
02:41:55,260 --> 02:41:56,800
It's just...

2157
02:41:58,960 --> 02:42:00,600
I can't help it, guys.

2158
02:42:00,640 --> 02:42:01,460
You don't understand.

2159
02:42:02,360 --> 02:42:02,800
Okay.

2160
02:42:06,040 --> 02:42:07,060
It's so...

2161
02:42:07,060 --> 02:42:08,180
I can't help it.

2162
02:42:08,380 --> 02:42:09,740
It's always the booty.

2163
02:42:12,080 --> 02:42:14,240
Too much junk in that truck.

2164
02:42:15,020 --> 02:42:18,500
Try pairing it with a strong open hand.

2165
02:42:20,940 --> 02:42:22,640
I can't help it.

2166
02:42:23,160 --> 02:42:24,000
It's just...

2167
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,720
Like, she's asking me to smack it.

2168
02:42:26,800 --> 02:42:28,700
And I want to smack it with my face.

2169
02:42:31,700 --> 02:42:33,300
You understand, right?

2170
02:42:33,320 --> 02:42:35,700
You all understand.

2171
02:42:40,940 --> 02:42:43,580
It's so understandable, right?

2172
02:42:44,580 --> 02:42:45,720
I understand.

2173
02:42:53,480 --> 02:42:55,580
Perfectly understandable.

2174
02:43:02,340 --> 02:43:04,040
Like, look.

2175
02:43:07,020 --> 02:43:08,960
Can you really blame me?

2176
02:43:08,960 --> 02:43:10,280
Oh, thank you.

2177
02:43:11,740 --> 02:43:14,180
Can you really blame me?

2178
02:43:19,240 --> 02:43:21,720
Oh my god, I'm so unlucky.

2179
02:43:24,220 --> 02:43:27,460
I didn't think, like, I didn't realize it can bounce off.

2180
02:43:32,460 --> 02:43:33,920
I'm gonna get the maggots off.

2181
02:43:34,880 --> 02:43:35,820
Okay, that one.

2182
02:43:37,440 --> 02:43:39,640
Oh my god, I can't help it.

2183
02:43:41,040 --> 02:43:42,380
I can't help it.

2184
02:43:42,700 --> 02:43:43,300
She's...

2185
02:43:43,300 --> 02:43:44,380
She's just...

2186
02:43:44,380 --> 02:43:45,480
It's so inviting.

2187
02:43:46,700 --> 02:43:47,580
Oh, wait, there's more?

2188
02:43:48,600 --> 02:43:48,900
What?

2189
02:43:51,340 --> 02:43:52,380
What's going on?

2190
02:43:53,920 --> 02:43:54,100
What?

2191
02:43:57,620 --> 02:43:58,220
What's...

2192
02:43:58,220 --> 02:43:58,720
Hello?

2193
02:44:00,700 --> 02:44:01,300
Hello?

2194
02:44:03,080 --> 02:44:04,320
Where's she go?

2195
02:44:05,060 --> 02:44:05,360
What?

2196
02:44:06,320 --> 02:44:06,980
She...

2197
02:44:08,040 --> 02:44:10,980
You live here forever now.

2198
02:44:11,520 --> 02:44:13,820
I got soft luck.

2199
02:44:14,240 --> 02:44:15,360
Are you serious?

2200
02:44:15,760 --> 02:44:20,040
She's like, you have been jailed for your crimes.

2201
02:44:21,160 --> 02:44:22,760
I didn't know.

2202
02:44:23,080 --> 02:44:24,480
She did it first.

2203
02:44:24,960 --> 02:44:25,620
She...

2204
02:44:28,480 --> 02:44:32,040
She was the one that came at me with her booty.

2205
02:44:32,520 --> 02:44:33,640
It's not my fault.

2206
02:44:33,780 --> 02:44:35,220
I was the one that didn't consent.

2207
02:44:35,460 --> 02:44:35,720
Sir.

2208
02:44:36,120 --> 02:44:37,480
I was the one that did.

2209
02:44:37,480 --> 02:44:39,100
I swear I didn't consent.

2210
02:44:39,400 --> 02:44:40,180
It wasn't her.

2211
02:44:40,300 --> 02:44:41,140
It was me

2212
02:44:45,260 --> 02:44:48,300
You have been jailed for your sins

2213
02:44:51,860 --> 02:45:01,900
Tell that I'm the victim I'm the victim she put her booty to my face Her booty was on my I did not cuz I swear to God.

2214
02:45:02,020 --> 02:45:02,800
I did not consent.

2215
02:45:03,180 --> 02:45:13,940
Yes, I might have got smashed softer, but that didn't mean I didn't, because that's what they all say.

2216
02:45:14,360 --> 02:45:15,780
Please, let me out!

2217
02:45:16,300 --> 02:45:17,140
Let me out!

2218
02:45:21,220 --> 02:45:23,780
I have the ass bird, freaking.

2219
02:45:24,060 --> 02:45:26,340
Please, please, let me talk to HR.

2220
02:45:26,520 --> 02:45:27,380
Don't understand.

2221
02:45:27,980 --> 02:45:29,560
HR will understand.

2222
02:45:31,320 --> 02:45:34,420
I can't believe I have to quit to mend you.

2223
02:45:34,820 --> 02:45:38,040
I can't Leave it.

2224
02:45:41,460 --> 02:45:42,820
Oh my god.

2225
02:45:49,990 --> 02:45:52,350
I can't believe I do this.

2226
02:45:53,070 --> 02:45:53,550
Again.

2227
02:45:53,930 --> 02:45:55,910
I don't even get silk for it.

2228
02:45:56,810 --> 02:45:59,190
I have to farm my silk right now.

2229
02:46:02,660 --> 02:46:04,520
Oh, I'll farm some silk real quick.

2230
02:46:07,780 --> 02:46:08,780
There we go.

2231
02:46:12,040 --> 02:46:13,440
I got scanned.

2232
02:46:14,260 --> 02:46:15,860
I can't believe it.

2233
02:46:18,080 --> 02:46:21,520
Yes, I may or may not have been smacked in the...

2234
02:46:21,520 --> 02:46:22,660
I didn't stop...

2235
02:46:22,660 --> 02:46:26,840
I didn't stop her from smacking her booty in my face several times.

2236
02:46:27,240 --> 02:46:30,720
But that does not mean I consented to it.

2237
02:46:31,200 --> 02:46:32,120
Yes, I know.

2238
02:46:32,260 --> 02:46:34,280
Like, yep, it was more than once.

2239
02:46:34,840 --> 02:46:36,780
But I was gonna stop her.

2240
02:46:36,980 --> 02:46:38,440
I was going to.

2241
02:46:43,020 --> 02:46:44,180
You just...

2242
02:46:44,260 --> 02:46:46,440
I was about to stop her, okay?

2243
02:46:47,900 --> 02:46:49,100
You don't have your stat.

2244
02:47:01,620 --> 02:47:02,260
Nice.

2245
02:47:04,260 --> 02:47:04,580
Oh.

2246
02:47:05,520 --> 02:47:06,600
Gotta make sure.

2247
02:47:11,340 --> 02:47:11,980
Okay.

2248
02:47:12,780 --> 02:47:16,060
I don't want to, like, stay too close to the corner.

2249
02:47:19,260 --> 02:47:20,220
Oh, shit!

2250
02:47:20,520 --> 02:47:21,020
Nice.

2251
02:47:21,700 --> 02:47:21,840
Twent.

2252
02:47:24,680 --> 02:47:26,680
I got to have one more, you know?

2253
02:47:29,300 --> 02:47:30,680
You don't understand.

2254
02:47:31,420 --> 02:47:32,200
I was relapsing.

2255
02:47:32,280 --> 02:47:33,240
It's been so long.

2256
02:47:33,580 --> 02:47:33,620
Okay.

2257
02:47:34,360 --> 02:47:34,880
Now what?

2258
02:47:35,700 --> 02:47:37,020
What the fuck?

2259
02:47:38,060 --> 02:47:39,860
Okay, I've not seen that move before.

2260
02:47:43,540 --> 02:47:46,840
Was that what's supposed to happen if she didn't stop, Locke?

2261
02:47:49,180 --> 02:47:49,780
Okay.

2262
02:47:52,540 --> 02:47:54,940
I assume that's okay.

2263
02:47:55,320 --> 02:47:57,980
Yeah, she just never came back out.

2264
02:47:59,400 --> 02:48:00,590
Oh, my God, you're serious.

2265
02:48:06,400 --> 02:48:07,100

02:48:15,660 --> 02:48:16,620
I forgot she comes back out.

02:48:18,420 --> 02:48:20,500

2302
02:51:05,370 --> 02:51:06,410
All right.

2303
02:51:08,590 --> 02:51:10,850
Oh, okay, we got over this way.

2304
02:51:16,710 --> 02:51:18,170
What item in Sinner's Road?

2305
02:51:22,330 --> 02:51:24,110
There's an item in Sinner's Road?

2306
02:51:29,850 --> 02:51:33,250
Okay, we need to go to the plastic steps.

2307
02:51:35,410 --> 02:51:36,690
There you go.

2308
02:51:38,890 --> 02:51:40,210
We don't need it.

2309
02:51:42,030 --> 02:51:43,210
It's fine.

2310
02:51:48,080 --> 02:51:49,360
Okay, we're all down.

2311
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:52,080
It's on the chair first, just in case.

2312
02:51:56,780 --> 02:51:57,420
We...

2313
02:51:57,420 --> 02:51:57,600
Oh.

2314
02:51:58,100 --> 02:51:59,360
I should stop weeding.

2315
02:52:00,580 --> 02:52:01,120
It's like...

2316
02:52:01,120 --> 02:52:01,900
Oh my god, okay.

2317
02:52:02,060 --> 02:52:03,000
It's like...

2318
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:03,960
Down here.

2319
02:52:04,060 --> 02:52:08,980
Oh my god, you're like, yeah, yeah, it is.

2320
02:52:09,380 --> 02:52:11,040
Yeah, you want to get down in my mouth?

2321
02:52:12,820 --> 02:52:15,680
It's just like, holy shit, the fuck was that?

2322
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,400
God, I forgot you, geometry fuck.

2323
02:52:24,080 --> 02:52:24,920
I hate you.

2324
02:52:27,220 --> 02:52:28,980
Get down, get down from here.

2325
02:52:33,390 --> 02:52:35,690
Oh my god, you're still here.

2326
02:52:37,310 --> 02:52:39,360
I will kill you.

2327
02:52:44,170 --> 02:52:46,150
Oh my god, that's not ideal.

2328
02:52:49,930 --> 02:52:51,610
That might not have been ideal.

2329
02:52:52,430 --> 02:52:55,070
Oh yeah, that was not ideal.

2330
02:52:58,030 --> 02:52:58,630
Oh, yep.

2331
02:53:00,130 --> 02:53:02,710
Yep, I'm not happy.

2332
02:53:07,830 --> 02:53:08,690
Okay.

2333
02:53:08,710 --> 02:53:08,950
it.

2334
02:53:10,670 --> 02:53:10,970
All right.

2335
02:53:11,610 --> 02:53:11,610
Two.

2336
02:53:13,410 --> 02:53:13,830
Two.

2337
02:53:14,090 --> 02:53:14,890
Oh, oh, oh.

2338
02:53:15,130 --> 02:53:16,050
Simple geometry.

2339
02:53:16,530 --> 02:53:18,550
Oh, that makes me so happy.

2340
02:53:20,970 --> 02:53:20,970
Oh.

2341
02:53:22,970 --> 02:53:23,190
Oh.

2342
02:53:23,830 --> 02:53:24,430
What's that?

2343
02:53:24,630 --> 02:53:26,910
He's spitting on me too.

2344
02:53:29,590 --> 02:53:30,930
It's like, ha, whoa.

2345
02:53:32,430 --> 02:53:33,010
That's crazy.

2346
02:53:33,110 --> 02:53:35,650
She did that crypto scam and never came back.

2347
02:53:37,430 --> 02:53:39,650
She actually rug pulled successfully.

2348
02:53:45,860 --> 02:53:46,860
She went, oh!

2349
02:53:47,500 --> 02:53:49,100
Oh my god, thank god I quit mine.

2350
02:53:50,360 --> 02:53:55,700
I don't know if this actually will work, but oh my god, I actually landed on that.

2351
02:54:03,530 --> 02:54:03,850
Okay.

2352
02:54:04,530 --> 02:54:05,130
That's fine.

2353
02:54:07,270 --> 02:54:09,270
Oh, there's too many things on my screen.

2354
02:54:10,790 --> 02:54:12,090
I hate it.

2355
02:54:14,370 --> 02:54:17,490
There's way too many things on my screen right now.

2356
02:54:25,420 --> 02:54:27,180
I don't feel fine, but it's fine.

2357
02:54:32,170 --> 02:54:34,450
I know I can dodge that.

2358
02:54:39,920 --> 02:54:40,220
Nice.

2359
02:54:40,500 --> 02:54:41,080
One down.

2360
02:54:41,840 --> 02:54:42,340
That's right.

2361
02:54:42,500 --> 02:54:43,360
I killed your lover.

2362
02:54:43,560 --> 02:54:44,840
I hope you die alone now.

2363
02:54:46,340 --> 02:54:47,120
That's right.

2364
02:54:47,720 --> 02:54:48,060
What?

2365
02:54:49,320 --> 02:54:50,160
That's right.

2366
02:54:50,400 --> 02:54:51,800
The love of your life is dead.

2367
02:54:51,820 --> 02:54:58,180
I hope you live a long life and die alone knowing I killed your love of your life.

2368
02:54:59,140 --> 02:55:01,080
Oh, that's it?

2369
02:55:02,020 --> 02:55:05,820
So long as you can prove the triangle is indeed a triangle, geometry is a...

2370
02:55:05,820 --> 02:55:07,840
Okay, thank you for the super chat eating.

2371
02:55:08,040 --> 02:55:09,020
Thank you, thank you.

2372
02:55:10,020 --> 02:55:11,460
That's fucking right.

2373
02:55:15,080 --> 02:55:16,940
I found the Apotenuse.

2374
02:55:18,380 --> 02:55:18,700
Alright.

2375
02:55:21,820 --> 02:55:24,060
I still have to keep going?

2376
02:55:26,920 --> 02:55:29,940
There's no way he's gonna swore revenge on me, right?

2377
02:55:33,300 --> 02:55:40,060
Nah, surely he ain't gonna swore revenge for me killing the love of his life.

2378
02:55:41,600 --> 02:55:42,460
No way.

2379
02:55:46,140 --> 02:55:47,580
I can't see.

2380
02:55:47,580 --> 02:56:06,440
they could never oh hey nice a chair hello are you alive so rude to raise a pen stress from their deep meditation you carry on with that kind of rash behavior and you're likely to be struck quick through

2382
02:56:19,480 --> 02:56:20,540
Hi, a pinstress.

2383
02:56:20,940 --> 02:56:22,480
Your kneel there might fit you fair.

2384
02:56:23,480 --> 02:56:28,060
Strange as it is and all, but it's a pin that the glorious weapon of Farloon.

2385
02:56:28,760 --> 02:56:31,200
Given I'm not awake, maybe you fancy a little training.

2386
02:56:32,640 --> 02:56:34,220
Care to test the power of pinstress?

2387
02:56:34,740 --> 02:56:37,660
Might be even this old master could show you a thing or two.

2388
02:56:38,320 --> 02:56:38,540
Sure.

2389
02:56:38,900 --> 02:56:40,040
For free?

2390
02:56:40,780 --> 02:56:44,060
Oh my god, you're not gonna monetize this, like all the other fucking bugs?

2391
02:56:45,140 --> 02:56:46,280
Well, choice, you know, bug.

2392
02:56:46,540 --> 02:56:48,060
Let's get our shells are shaken.

2393
02:56:49,080 --> 02:56:49,600
Thank God.

2394
02:56:51,340 --> 02:56:52,700
Thank fucking God.

2395
02:56:53,900 --> 02:56:56,140
Someone that's willing to teach me for free.

2396
02:56:57,740 --> 02:57:00,440
I didn't know how good I had it in Hollow Knight.

2397
02:57:03,460 --> 02:57:05,620
The first free thing in ages.

2398
02:57:08,040 --> 02:57:08,920
How grand.

2399
02:57:09,280 --> 02:57:11,140
To face an opponent with a bit of energy.

2400
02:57:11,680 --> 02:57:13,160
Your skill won clear enough.

2401
02:57:13,560 --> 02:57:15,960
I hope my training has granted some insight.

2402
02:57:18,320 --> 02:57:21,100
Yeah, I don't know if I'll ever use this.

2403
02:57:22,620 --> 02:57:24,500
All right, where do we go now?

2404
02:57:25,880 --> 02:57:27,140
I assume it's this thing.

2405
02:57:34,270 --> 02:57:35,170
Oh, left.

2406
02:57:35,730 --> 02:57:36,070
Whoops.

2407
02:57:44,820 --> 02:57:46,340
Yes, it was in that thing.

2408
02:57:51,300 --> 02:57:52,500
Okay, I...

2409
02:57:52,500 --> 02:57:54,040
Not here.

2410
02:58:01,370 --> 02:58:02,210
This way.

2411
02:58:03,150 --> 02:58:09,910
I'll just hang here a little bit Because I'm scared Just hang in there

2412
02:58:19,980 --> 02:58:21,660
Okay now I go this way

2413
02:58:28,590 --> 02:58:33,830
Alright That must be it This must be where I have to go

2414
02:58:37,250 --> 02:58:47,990
And I saw this guy And I was like, fuck, I...

2415
02:58:47,990 --> 02:58:52,010
Oh, I hate you.

2416
02:58:53,930 --> 02:58:54,990
Get out of here.

2417
02:58:58,920 --> 02:58:59,560
Oh, my God.

2418
02:58:59,720 --> 02:58:59,940
Of course.

2419
02:59:00,200 --> 02:59:01,300
Of course there's a rock.

2420
02:59:03,080 --> 02:59:03,500
Oh, my God.

2421
02:59:03,640 --> 02:59:05,260
I have to do this parkour thing all over again, too.

2422
02:59:05,540 --> 02:59:05,820
Later.

2423
02:59:05,940 --> 02:59:06,860
I can feel it.

2424
02:59:09,640 --> 02:59:11,460
Was I supposed to destroy that?

2425
02:59:13,060 --> 02:59:13,500
Oh.

2426
02:59:13,940 --> 02:59:15,900
Crow sways, clear water flows.

2427
02:59:15,980 --> 02:59:17,560
Upon our river, free of time.

2428
02:59:17,580 --> 02:59:19,760
I was like, fuck reading!

2429
02:59:25,120 --> 02:59:26,040
Oh.

2430
02:59:33,480 --> 02:59:35,300
Oh my god.

2431
02:59:36,240 --> 02:59:40,000
Okay, I'm just gonna farm this for silk, actually.

2432
02:59:44,900 --> 02:59:45,780
Oh!

2433
02:59:48,580 --> 02:59:49,500
Oops.

2434
02:59:54,390 --> 02:59:56,730
Look, I did not expect that platform.

2435
02:59:58,290 --> 02:59:59,630
Oh, I am really...

2436
02:59:59,650 --> 03:00:01,670
hanging by the thread right now.

2437
03:00:06,720 --> 03:00:07,640
Oh, thank God.

2438
03:00:08,920 --> 03:00:09,720
Oh, my!

2439
03:00:12,770 --> 03:00:13,790
Oh, fuck you.

2440
03:00:14,150 --> 03:00:15,090
Actually, fuck you.

2441
03:00:24,230 --> 03:00:26,070
Oh, my God.

2442
03:00:27,070 --> 03:00:27,810
Oh, my God.

2443
03:00:28,230 --> 03:00:28,750
You know what?

2444
03:00:30,150 --> 03:00:30,750
I...

2445
03:00:30,750 --> 03:00:31,610
No!

2446
03:00:41,420 --> 03:00:42,980
I hate this place.

2447
03:00:43,260 --> 03:00:44,640
I hate this place.

2448
03:00:45,960 --> 03:00:47,600
I'm just gonna hang in there.

2449
03:00:52,450 --> 03:00:54,050
He's gonna hang in there.

2450
03:01:02,340 --> 03:01:03,360
I didn't think.

2451
03:01:03,940 --> 03:01:04,760
I didn't.

2452
03:01:04,760 --> 03:01:06,540
I forgot about this fucker.

2453
03:01:08,120 --> 03:01:10,000
I was like, whoa, cool speedrun.

2454
03:01:10,140 --> 03:01:10,780
Take that shit.

2455
03:01:10,960 --> 03:01:11,480
And I forgot.

2456
03:01:11,780 --> 03:01:12,780
I left him alive.

2457
03:01:13,140 --> 03:01:13,720
I forgot.

2458
03:01:14,020 --> 03:01:15,680
I left that fucker alive.

2459
03:01:21,780 --> 03:01:23,140
Yeah, I'm just gonna...

2460
03:01:24,280 --> 03:01:26,660
I'm just gonna kill him before he fucks me up again.

2461
03:01:27,540 --> 03:01:28,280
Oh my god.

2462
03:01:28,360 --> 03:01:29,080

2465
03:02:10,740 --> 03:02:11,480
Okay, I don't...

2466
03:02:12,240 --> 03:02:12,720
Actually...

2467
03:02:12,720 --> 03:02:14,280
No, I don't need to farm it.

2468
03:02:15,020 --> 03:02:16,340
I need to do this again.

2469
03:02:21,950 --> 03:02:22,430
Okay.

2470
03:02:23,730 --> 03:02:24,350
There we go.

2471
03:02:25,230 --> 03:02:26,850
I didn't need to grab my silk.

2472
03:02:43,310 --> 03:02:43,530
Okay.

2473
03:02:44,090 --> 03:02:44,570
How?

2474
03:02:45,530 --> 03:02:46,010
What's...

2475
03:02:48,650 --> 03:02:50,850
I forgot that was also a timed area.

2476
03:02:50,970 --> 03:02:52,270
I forgot that was also timed.

2477
03:02:52,350 --> 03:02:53,230
I'm so stupid.

2478
03:02:59,860 --> 03:03:06,120
I thought it was the other platform I thought it was this area

2479
03:03:14,780 --> 03:03:22,090
Speedrun It was planned It was simply planned

2480
03:03:27,470 --> 03:03:36,870
I thought that was a safe zone I was like I'm ready But it was still worms It was still worms.

2481
03:03:37,430 --> 03:03:38,350
Who would have thought?

2482
03:03:39,210 --> 03:03:41,510
It's always just worms.

2483
03:03:49,770 --> 03:03:49,990
Oh, wait.

2484
03:03:50,610 --> 03:03:51,230
Is she here?

2485
03:03:51,850 --> 03:03:55,570
Oh, hello, hello.

2486
03:03:56,410 --> 03:03:57,470
Oh, hello.

2487
03:03:58,710 --> 03:03:59,750
They're greeting, Shakira.

2488
03:04:00,270 --> 03:04:06,990
In these drifts consumed by Krustin's sand, those cabins have returned to nature by seeing evidence of bold structures buried throughout.

2489
03:04:08,430 --> 03:04:48,290
The shows of their bolder right builders rest in a tower above a grand tribe they seem and strong fighters i'm sure alas they exist now only as hard and husk lamb a child wielding needle we live too late to match their claws i'm broke i'm they didn't carry any cash on them okay that's fine i don't need cash i'm i'm okay i didn't realize that I did not realize that these fuckers live in a cashless society.

2490
03:04:52,510 --> 03:04:53,350
Who would have thought?

2491
03:05:02,410 --> 03:05:03,050
They live.

2492
03:05:03,970 --> 03:05:04,690
Oh, wait, I was...

2493
03:05:04,690 --> 03:05:05,210
Oh, my God.

2494
03:05:05,290 --> 03:05:05,510
You're right.

2495
03:05:05,590 --> 03:05:06,070
I have a rosary.

2496
03:05:06,890 --> 03:05:07,850
I'm coming back down.

2497
03:05:09,010 --> 03:05:10,290
I'm coming back down.

2498
03:05:18,110 --> 03:05:18,570
Okay.

2499
03:05:19,830 --> 03:05:20,470
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

2500
03:05:21,490 --> 03:05:24,050
I forgot the most important part using the rosary.

2501
03:05:24,510 --> 03:05:25,670
Don't worry, I got the money.

2502
03:05:26,010 --> 03:05:26,650
Oh, give me a sec.

2503
03:05:26,770 --> 03:05:27,130
I got it.

2504
03:05:31,870 --> 03:05:33,790
All right, now I got it.

2505
03:05:37,510 --> 03:05:38,270
Oh, there's a bench?

2506
03:05:38,410 --> 03:05:38,670
Where?

2507
03:05:45,710 --> 03:05:46,110
What?

2508
03:05:47,890 --> 03:05:48,890
What's this area?

2509
03:05:52,170 --> 03:05:52,570
Yeah?

2510
03:05:59,820 --> 03:06:00,940
All the way down?

2511
03:06:09,680 --> 03:06:11,180
Oh, to the right.

2512
03:06:11,500 --> 03:06:13,700
Oh, I thought you meant the shortcut.

2513
03:06:14,820 --> 03:06:15,580
This way.

2514
03:06:27,140 --> 03:06:29,360
Oh, do not go right.

2515
03:06:31,100 --> 03:06:32,780
Alright, now I'm here.

2516
03:06:35,920 --> 03:06:37,360
Have I used that bench already?

2517
03:06:38,740 --> 03:06:40,220
Wait, guys, have I already...

2518
03:06:41,920 --> 03:06:44,240
I've already done that bench, right?

2519
03:06:44,460 --> 03:06:45,260
I don't remember.

2520
03:06:45,900 --> 03:06:46,180
Have I?

2521
03:06:50,500 --> 03:06:52,100
I already sat there.

2522
03:06:55,740 --> 03:06:57,260
Oh, at the pinst...

2523
03:06:57,260 --> 03:06:58,500
Oh, wait, I rested at her.

2524
03:06:58,700 --> 03:06:59,800
I forgot about her already.

2525
03:07:00,240 --> 03:07:00,920
She was...

2526
03:07:00,920 --> 03:07:03,220
She was not that important in my life, apparently.

2527
03:07:03,580 --> 03:07:04,940
Because I already forgot she existed.

2528
03:07:08,240 --> 03:07:09,420
What's over here again?

2529
03:07:10,360 --> 03:07:12,360
Wait, what the fuck is in my pocket?

2530
03:07:12,920 --> 03:07:13,660
Oh, what's up?

2531
03:07:13,960 --> 03:07:15,340
Pickled whatever shit.

2532
03:07:16,820 --> 03:07:17,680
What's over here?

2533
03:07:22,510 --> 03:07:22,990
Hello?

2534
03:07:23,090 --> 03:07:24,250
Oh my god, it's you.

2535
03:07:24,990 --> 03:07:25,690
Oh, hey then.

2536
03:07:26,070 --> 03:07:30,250
Fancy, fancy bug, like you keep being cringe Those cozy little nook where?

2537
03:07:30,810 --> 03:07:32,830
Here we got some nice stuff, did you?

2538
03:07:33,270 --> 03:07:37,990
Oh, oh, oh, all kinds of tasty goodies Find their way here, that's for sure.

2539
03:07:39,350 --> 03:07:41,830
I care very, very little How you procure your goods, thief.

2540
03:07:42,010 --> 03:07:42,930
Do you have something worth trading?

2541
03:07:43,150 --> 03:07:44,230
I'm in part with my rosary.

2542
03:07:44,510 --> 03:07:46,430
Well, we never say no to a fair trade.

2543
03:07:47,290 --> 03:07:48,650
Now take a look at what we got.

2544
03:07:49,690 --> 03:07:51,110
All right, this does not seem fair.

2545
03:07:51,530 --> 03:07:53,830
This absolutely does not seem fair.

2546
03:07:57,030 --> 03:07:59,150
Oh, this is for better farming.

2547
03:07:59,350 --> 03:08:00,510
Might think of, like, give the chip.

2548
03:08:00,590 --> 03:08:00,870
Thank you.

2549
03:08:01,170 --> 03:08:01,550
Thank you.

2550
03:08:06,730 --> 03:08:08,210
Alright, there's the Nino stuff.

2551
03:08:10,010 --> 03:08:11,570
Oh, alright.

2552
03:08:14,130 --> 03:08:15,090
Can you even get this?

2553
03:08:15,230 --> 03:08:16,330
You stole these.

2554
03:08:16,450 --> 03:08:17,950
I wish I stole them first.

2555
03:08:20,110 --> 03:08:21,010
It's not fair.

2556
03:08:21,590 --> 03:08:24,110
It should have been me to steal it first.

2557
03:08:33,280 --> 03:08:33,800
Alright.

2558
03:08:34,940 --> 03:08:36,160
I should steal it.

2559
03:08:36,200 --> 03:08:37,040
Back, you're right.

2560
03:08:38,040 --> 03:08:39,940
I should steal it back from him.

2561
03:08:41,060 --> 03:08:42,340
Alright, now I gotta figure out it.

2562
03:08:43,000 --> 03:08:44,800
I gotta go all the way back.

2563
03:08:52,370 --> 03:08:53,070
A bako.

2564
03:08:53,510 --> 03:08:54,590
I mean, it's not that bad.

2565
03:08:54,750 --> 03:08:55,830
Yeah, it feels like a shortcut.

2566
03:08:56,190 --> 03:08:56,590
Thank God.

2567
03:08:58,210 --> 03:08:59,630
It's like a shortcut or something.

2568
03:09:04,750 --> 03:09:06,250
Is that crazy?

2569
03:09:07,650 --> 03:09:08,950
That felt like a shortcut.

2570
03:09:11,890 --> 03:09:13,430
Okay, these guys are not annoying.

2571
03:09:20,050 --> 03:09:23,390
Yeah, it's definitely easier than running from the Pinterest place.

2572
03:09:25,330 --> 03:09:26,250
Wait, what?

2573
03:09:28,670 --> 03:09:30,250
Where do I go from here?

2574
03:09:32,590 --> 03:09:33,490
Push left wall.

2575
03:09:33,630 --> 03:09:34,610
This one?

2576
03:09:43,440 --> 03:09:44,960
Spikes down left.

2577
03:09:46,620 --> 03:09:48,100
Oh, this one!

2578
03:09:49,680 --> 03:09:50,100
Okay.

2579
03:09:52,960 --> 03:09:53,880
Hello, I'm here.

2580
03:09:57,980 --> 03:10:00,880
I am here to ruin your home.

2581
03:10:04,900 --> 03:10:05,300
That's right.

2582
03:10:05,500 --> 03:10:06,840
Fight amongst yourself.

2583
03:10:07,280 --> 03:10:07,280
Fight.

2584
03:10:08,360 --> 03:10:09,220
God, I hate you.

2585
03:10:12,400 --> 03:10:15,520
I hope my nail upgrade kills you a little faster.

2586
03:10:17,920 --> 03:10:18,460
Oh, my!

2587
03:10:19,020 --> 03:10:19,940
Fuck you!

2588
03:10:23,650 --> 03:10:24,590
Bottom right.

2589
03:10:29,320 --> 03:10:30,880
Oh, my God.

2590
03:10:32,060 --> 03:10:44,920
that's fine that's fine I I just wanted to touch it I guess

2591
03:10:52,330 --> 03:11:13,390
but I'm like actually it's so risky what I'm doing the spikes they call for me oh Oh!

2592
03:11:19,090 --> 03:11:20,450
Oh my god, please give me enough.

2593
03:11:21,970 --> 03:11:22,710
Thank God.

2594
03:11:26,230 --> 03:11:27,870
Surely nothing will go wrong, right?

2595
03:11:37,610 --> 03:11:39,210
It's the- it's the double!

2596
03:11:39,270 --> 03:11:40,210
I swear to God!

2597
03:11:40,870 --> 03:11:43,030
I swear to God, it's the double jump!

2598
03:11:43,310 --> 03:11:43,810
I swear!

2599
03:11:44,410 --> 03:11:49,790
I- Badoki, you're not- No, it's- it's the double jump.

2600
03:11:55,550 --> 03:12:06,310
I swear It's the double jump It's the only way I can explain it

2601
03:12:13,040 --> 03:12:15,200
Sure, dokey

2602
03:12:24,050 --> 03:12:35,490
No, I'm scared I got scared I got scared of the spikes They were right above me

2603
03:12:45,160 --> 03:12:46,120
It's okay.

2604
03:12:46,500 --> 03:12:47,280
That's fine.

2605
03:12:48,380 --> 03:12:49,440
I have learned.

2606
03:12:55,030 --> 03:12:55,410
Alright.

2607
03:12:55,890 --> 03:12:56,330
Abaco.

2608
03:13:00,250 --> 03:13:02,310
I missed these guys.

2609
03:13:02,490 --> 03:13:04,830
Why can't it be these guys as my enemies?

2610
03:13:12,340 --> 03:13:13,060
Okay.

2611
03:13:16,650 --> 03:13:17,810
Oh my god.

2612
03:13:18,210 --> 03:13:18,990
His body.

2613
03:13:19,850 --> 03:13:21,830
His body just smacked me.

2614
03:13:22,910 --> 03:13:24,250
That should be illegal.

2615
03:13:25,350 --> 03:13:26,070
Ref!

2616
03:13:30,870 --> 03:13:31,990
Oh my god, there it is.

2617
03:13:35,200 --> 03:13:36,660
Okay, I gotta get released.

2618
03:13:37,080 --> 03:13:38,140
I don't wanna hit my head.

2619
03:13:38,480 --> 03:13:40,160
I- I can't- no!

2620
03:13:48,300 --> 03:13:50,000
I can't open!

2621
03:13:54,020 --> 03:13:55,700
You don't understand!

2622
03:14:01,300 --> 03:14:01,780
No!

2623
03:14:04,920 --> 03:14:07,000
It calls for me!

2624
03:14:16,540 --> 03:14:17,940
Those spikes!

2625
03:14:22,570 --> 03:14:24,030
It keeps calling!

2626
03:14:27,050 --> 03:14:29,130
I don't even know where I'm supposed to be at.

2627
03:14:35,430 --> 03:14:35,950
Yeah.

2628
03:14:39,600 --> 03:14:40,380
Yeah.

2629
03:14:41,320 --> 03:14:44,000
I'll get these out so I don't hit my head.

2630
03:14:44,700 --> 03:14:45,500
I have to.

2631
03:14:47,140 --> 03:14:48,560
Safety first.

2632
03:14:59,830 --> 03:15:00,110
Whoa.

2633
03:15:03,940 --> 03:15:05,520
Okay, nice.

2634
03:15:07,140 --> 03:15:08,760
Safety first.

2635
03:15:09,620 --> 03:15:16,610
There you go.

2636
03:15:20,880 --> 03:15:21,940
What a little...

2637
03:15:21,940 --> 03:15:22,940
Nice surprise.

2638
03:15:25,220 --> 03:15:26,460
Wait, how do I leave?

2639
03:15:27,400 --> 03:15:29,300
How do I leave?

2640
03:15:33,140 --> 03:15:33,960
Okay.

2641
03:15:40,510 --> 03:15:42,190
Now go back.

2642
03:15:44,510 --> 03:15:46,490
Wait, but what's over here then?

2643
03:15:47,810 --> 03:15:49,170
Oh, absolute death.

2644
03:15:50,430 --> 03:15:51,510
That's cool.

2645
03:15:56,320 --> 03:15:57,020
Oh, nothing.

2646
03:16:05,590 --> 03:16:08,070
I love it when you get absolutely nothing.

2647
03:16:11,230 --> 03:16:11,950
Yay!

2648
03:16:18,070 --> 03:16:18,790
Tihi.

2649
03:16:23,360 --> 03:16:24,740
Oh my god, not you.

2650
03:16:26,480 --> 03:16:27,220
Watch you again.

2651
03:16:27,900 --> 03:16:28,630
Get me out of here.

2652
03:16:36,290 --> 03:16:37,430
Okay, uh, bench.

2653
03:16:39,350 --> 03:16:40,730
Oh, I missed something?

2654
03:16:42,670 --> 03:16:43,570
What did I miss?

2655
03:16:46,010 --> 03:16:47,870
No, I don't believe you.

2656
03:16:48,390 --> 03:16:49,950
I don't believe you.

2657
03:16:50,250 --> 03:16:50,990
There.

2658
03:16:55,070 --> 03:16:55,810
Okay.

2659
03:16:57,090 --> 03:16:58,630
Let's slowly float down.

2660
03:17:12,530 --> 03:17:14,370

Goodbye.

2669
03:18:49,320 --> 03:18:52,780
Apparently you would have gambled with me.

2670
03:18:53,140 --> 03:18:53,900
We did it.

2671
03:18:54,020 --> 03:18:55,840
We beat our gambling addiction.

2672
03:18:56,080 --> 03:18:57,420
We did it, guys.

2673
03:18:58,440 --> 03:19:01,200
He gambled his last gambler.

We're freed.

2679
03:19:19,090 --> 03:19:21,950
I never got addicted to gambling, guys.

2680
03:19:22,410 --> 03:19:23,210
We did it.

2681
03:19:23,410 --> 03:19:25,830
We don't have to go to rehab.

2682
03:19:26,370 --> 03:19:28,310
Just wait until the guy dies.

2683
03:19:28,810 --> 03:19:29,310
Just wait.

2684
03:19:29,490 --> 03:19:31,110
Wait until your dealer dies.

2685
03:19:31,250 --> 03:19:32,590

New water bottle is just next to me.

2691
03:20:26,210 --> 03:20:27,210
I just have to get out of my room.

2692
03:20:30,710 --> 03:20:31,190
Alright.

2693
03:20:31,510 --> 03:20:32,210
Where do we go?

2694
03:20:33,090 --> 03:20:34,150
We're in Belhite.

2695
03:20:37,910 --> 03:20:39,470
No, I need my compass.

2696
03:20:40,790 --> 03:20:41,650
You guys don't understand.

2697
03:20:41,830 --> 03:20:42,810
I'm so...

2698
03:20:42,810 --> 03:20:43,910
You don't understand.

2699
03:20:44,070 --> 03:20:44,930
I need the compass.

2700
03:20:47,490 --> 03:20:49,130
The courier is rashing.

2701
03:20:49,990 --> 03:20:50,510
This guy?

2702
03:20:52,170 --> 03:20:52,650
Hey.

2703
03:20:52,910 --> 03:20:53,230
Hey.

2704
03:20:53,590 --> 03:20:54,290
No talking.

2705
03:20:58,350 --> 03:20:58,790
Yeah.

2706
03:21:02,470 --> 03:21:03,990
As it is yours, Miss Courier.

2707
03:21:04,630 --> 03:21:07,210
Meats prepare fresh as fresh in our special way.

2708
03:21:07,710 --> 03:21:12,110
Miss Courier must know our rash is delicious, strong, fatty food, but it's not long and less.

2709
03:21:12,690 --> 03:21:15,190
If not story quick, it is flavor-feeding faster and foul.

2710
03:21:17,230 --> 03:21:20,010
If the rash is likely to spoil, I shall make fastest in the dough.

2711
03:21:20,370 --> 03:21:23,190
I'm most desired to see your efforts or your scant supplies wasted.

2712
03:21:24,310 --> 03:21:26,190
Behold, before the poor art, you must know.

2713
03:21:26,550 --> 03:21:28,610
All the lawyers are in need of great, great care.

2714
03:21:30,670 --> 03:21:32,970
No bumps, no shake, no taking, funny traffic sport.

2715
03:21:33,210 --> 03:21:35,790
A lace claw wing must be used.

2716
03:21:38,410 --> 03:21:39,450
Oh, it's...

2717
03:21:43,290 --> 03:21:44,490
Oh, my God.

2718
03:21:45,190 --> 03:21:46,290

2719
03:21:46,550 --> 03:21:47,650

03:21:50,290 --> 03:21:51,690
Oh, it is time?

2721
03:21:52,090 --> 03:21:52,950
Alright, that's it.

2722
03:21:53,710 --> 03:21:55,290
I'm using the fast travel.

2723
03:21:58,610 --> 03:22:26,650

03:22:27,910 --> 03:22:30,230
Let me figure this out.

2726
03:22:42,180 --> 03:22:45,920
Blasted steps and then oh my god.

2727
03:22:48,520 --> 03:22:49,680
Wait, where am I?

2728
03:22:49,900 --> 03:22:51,860
First off, where am I?

2729
03:22:53,920 --> 03:22:56,120
Do I need to be faster though?

2730
03:22:56,740 --> 03:22:59,420
Like, does that actually would that actually help me?

2731
03:23:00,380 --> 03:23:01,860
Okay, we need the compass.

2732
03:23:02,160 --> 03:23:03,300
We don't need that then.

2733
03:23:11,010 --> 03:23:11,730
Okay.

2734
03:23:11,750 --> 03:23:12,810
Doki is time.

2735
03:23:13,030 --> 03:23:13,490
Give me a sec.

2736
03:23:13,610 --> 03:23:15,110
I need to figure this out.

2737
03:23:26,670 --> 03:23:28,550
Guys, I need to look at that map.

2738
03:23:34,300 --> 03:23:36,240
How do I get over there?

2739
03:23:36,600 --> 03:23:39,580
Okay, left, up.

2740
03:23:44,050 --> 03:23:45,770
Left, up.

2741
03:23:57,590 --> 03:23:58,150
And

2742
03:24:03,170 --> 03:24:03,730
then...

2743
03:24:03,950 --> 03:24:05,530
one of them is not real.

2744
03:24:07,010 --> 03:24:07,690
Oh, there he is.

2745
03:24:13,080 --> 03:24:15,060
Guys, I don't think I'm going to make it.

2746
03:24:20,100 --> 03:24:22,900
Guys, I don't think I'm going to make it.

2747
03:24:23,780 --> 03:24:26,320
I already have zero hopes in us.

2748
03:24:29,100 --> 03:24:31,220
Yeah, we're not making it.

2749
03:24:42,170 --> 03:24:43,030
Wait, what?

03:35:48,520 --> 03:35:50,990
He was born in the right time.

2837
03:35:51,650 --> 03:35:58,290
You know how people would be like, man, I was born in the wrong era.

2838
03:36:02,840 --> 03:36:03,900
He is so lucky.

2839
03:36:04,480 --> 03:36:07,660
He was 100% born in the right time at the right place.

2840
03:36:08,960 --> 03:36:11,160
Don't say that about him.

2841
03:36:11,500 --> 03:36:12,400
We all know.

2842
03:36:15,940 --> 03:36:20,760
He's a genetic mess, and we all know I love him.

2843
03:36:21,540 --> 03:36:23,800
I love him even though he's a genetic freak.

2844
03:36:31,080 --> 03:36:31,680
This is my entertainment.

2845
03:36:31,900 --> 03:36:33,000
This lady dancing.

2846
03:36:35,920 --> 03:36:38,560
He's a genetic freak, but he's my genetic freak.

2847
03:37:03,080 --> 03:37:19,600

I didn't eat yet.

2849
03:37:51,920 --> 03:37:54,400
Look at his fat belly.

2850
03:37:55,020 --> 03:37:56,360
He's gonna starve.

2851
03:37:59,560 --> 03:38:01,740
He even got a tree.

2852
03:38:12,160 --> 03:38:13,440
I wish I could kill that, bud.

2853
03:38:15,280 --> 03:38:19,680
I don't know.

2854
03:38:25,780 --> 03:38:30,680

2858
03:39:46,500 --> 03:39:47,020
It's alright.

2859
03:39:47,460 --> 03:39:48,840
I'll just break it.

2860
03:39:55,310 --> 03:39:56,270
Don't worry.

2861
03:39:58,810 --> 03:39:58,830
Boom!

2862
03:40:01,210 --> 03:40:02,830
It's time to break the meat.

2863
03:40:07,430 --> 03:40:08,910
But I can just bump into the walls.

2864
03:40:09,090 --> 03:40:09,830
Oh, I didn't know that.

2865
03:40:09,890 --> 03:40:12,810
Okay, now that I know that, bumping into walls also breaks it.

2866
03:40:12,850 --> 03:40:13,890
I gotta be careful then.

2867
03:40:19,010 --> 03:40:26,050
I didn't realize you can actually bump into the walls.

2868
03:40:27,090 --> 03:40:28,070
God, I'd rather just...

2869
03:40:28,070 --> 03:40:30,270
I'd rather really just fight a boss.

2870
03:40:30,610 --> 03:40:31,250
Like, I...

2871
03:40:31,770 --> 03:40:37,650
Oh, wait.

2872
03:40:39,130 --> 03:40:41,150
I should equip the fast thing, right?

2873
03:40:46,080 --> 03:40:47,000
There we go.

2874
03:40:48,200 --> 03:40:48,880
Oh.

2875
03:40:49,800 --> 03:40:50,800
Why am I poisoned?

2876
03:40:55,540 --> 03:40:57,420
Wait, I'm poisoned now, too?

2877
03:40:57,940 --> 03:40:58,680
Am I fast?

2878
03:41:05,970 --> 03:41:08,350
Oh, babe, thank you for the...

2879
03:41:08,350 --> 03:41:10,310
If I get the ships, thank you, thank you.

2880
03:41:10,710 --> 03:41:11,910
Wait, do I still have it?

2881
03:41:12,230 --> 03:41:14,090
Am I still fast with it?

2882
03:41:18,610 --> 03:41:20,170
Or is it just poison?

2883
03:41:21,370 --> 03:41:22,470
Oh, I'm still fast with it.

2884
03:41:22,590 --> 03:41:23,150
Oh, that's good.

2885
03:41:23,250 --> 03:41:23,590
Okay.

2886
03:41:23,810 --> 03:41:25,050
I need to figure out how to do this.

2887
03:41:25,610 --> 03:41:27,510
Okay, I do that, and then I go away.

2888
03:41:27,530 --> 03:41:28,290
up.

2889
03:41:29,070 --> 03:41:30,530
Then you get across that up.

2890
03:41:32,630 --> 03:41:34,270
And then up.

2891
03:41:34,830 --> 03:41:34,830
Okay.

2892
03:41:39,150 --> 03:41:39,410
Oh.

2893
03:41:40,570 --> 03:41:45,890
I don't think this is the run, but I'm just trying to I'm trying to figure this up.

2894
03:41:53,150 --> 03:41:54,770
I personally don't think this is the run.

2895
03:41:57,690 --> 03:41:59,490
Because I don't know.

2896
03:41:59,850 --> 03:42:01,070
I don't know.

2897
03:42:01,410 --> 03:42:02,990
I don't know.

2898
03:42:07,630 --> 03:42:08,710
I'm passing.

2899
03:42:08,970 --> 03:42:12,230
Yeah, I'm figuring out the speed where I'm passing right now.

2900
03:42:20,430 --> 03:42:20,790
Yeah.

2901
03:42:22,230 --> 03:42:25,230
Alright, now we're at Sinner's Road.

2902
03:42:34,880 --> 03:42:35,520
Oh, my God.

2903
03:42:36,000 --> 03:42:37,720
Oh, the dogs are awake now.

2904
03:42:37,920 --> 03:42:38,560
That's okay.

2905
03:42:39,780 --> 03:42:40,460
Pathfinding.

2906
03:42:41,360 --> 03:42:41,680
Okay.

2907
03:42:42,060 --> 03:42:42,500
Up.

2908
03:42:43,540 --> 03:42:44,360
Up left.

2909
03:42:44,500 --> 03:42:44,740
Okay.

2910
03:42:49,220 --> 03:42:49,900
Oh.

2911
03:42:50,760 --> 03:42:51,520
Aha!

2912
03:42:53,000 --> 03:42:53,960
Almost got me.

2913
03:42:54,500 --> 03:42:55,720
Almost got me there!

2914
03:42:58,240 --> 03:42:59,940
Okay, we gotta reset this.

2915
03:43:01,020 --> 03:43:03,900
I got scared.

2916
03:43:11,240 --> 03:43:11,620
Okay.

2917
03:43:14,420 --> 03:43:15,140
Oh!

2918
03:43:16,840 --> 03:43:18,420
Oh my god, that's close.

2919
03:43:22,500 --> 03:43:23,260
Alright.

2920
03:43:24,300 --> 03:43:25,900
path in here.

2921
03:43:34,550 --> 03:43:34,790
Okay.

2922
03:43:37,490 --> 03:43:38,970
I'm hesitating so much.

2923
03:43:39,110 --> 03:43:39,830
I'm so scared.

2924
03:43:39,950 --> 03:43:42,570
You guys have- I'm actually- I'm so scared.

2925
03:43:43,690 --> 03:43:45,930
I'm so fucking scared.

2926
03:43:56,190 --> 03:43:56,950
Okay.

2927
03:43:59,490 --> 03:43:59,990
No!

2928
03:44:01,110 --> 03:44:02,610
Oh, I fucked up.

2929
03:44:04,490 --> 03:44:05,950
I fucked up.

2930
03:44:12,890 --> 03:44:14,010
I'll go left.

2931
03:44:18,460 --> 03:44:19,700
Oh, yeah, I should have just went left.

2932
03:44:19,980 --> 03:44:20,640
I don't know.

2933
03:44:21,060 --> 03:44:21,620
I don't know.

2934
03:44:22,440 --> 03:44:24,240
I got a little cheeky.

2935
03:44:24,320 --> 03:44:25,880
I got very cheeky.

2936
03:44:33,880 --> 03:44:37,280
Okay, I don't remember how to get out of here, though.

2937
03:44:47,390 --> 03:44:48,870
What do I do after here?

2938
03:44:51,150 --> 03:44:52,150
Was it...

2939
03:44:53,430 --> 03:44:54,550
Where am I?

2940
03:45:05,650 --> 03:45:07,070
Holy shit, okay.

2941
03:45:10,130 --> 03:45:11,330
The elevator.

2942
03:45:11,770 --> 03:45:12,230
Was it left?

2943
03:45:12,870 --> 03:45:12,870
Okay.

2944
03:45:14,090 --> 03:45:14,370
Okay.

2945
03:45:16,170 --> 03:45:17,150
There we go.

2946
03:45:17,410 --> 03:45:18,490
That was close.

2947
03:45:18,630 --> 03:45:20,030
That was very close.

2948
03:45:29,190 --> 03:45:30,790
No, I fought that last judge.

2949
03:45:30,950 --> 03:45:33,470
I have to do the nail up.

2950
03:45:33,610 --> 03:45:33,810
Oh!

2951
03:45:34,330 --> 03:45:34,970
What are you doing?

2952
03:45:45,910 --> 03:45:46,510
Okay.

2953
03:45:46,530 --> 03:45:51,030
What the

2954
03:45:55,760 --> 03:45:55,760
hell?

2955
03:45:55,820 --> 03:45:56,580
No!

2956
03:45:59,920 --> 03:46:01,080
Guys, it's over.

2957
03:46:06,650 --> 03:46:07,210
It's...

2958
03:46:07,210 --> 03:46:08,590
It's over.

2959
03:46:09,350 --> 03:46:10,910
It's so over.

2960
03:46:11,590 --> 03:46:13,110
It's so over.

2961
03:46:13,390 --> 03:46:17,650
How do I...

2962
03:46:19,170 --> 03:46:19,750
Up.

2963
03:46:20,910 --> 03:46:21,150
Up.

2964
03:46:22,210 --> 03:46:22,530
Right.

2965
03:46:24,710 --> 03:46:26,250
It's so over.

2966
03:46:26,750 --> 03:46:27,850
It's so over.

2967
03:46:28,630 --> 03:46:28,670
Up.

2968
03:46:35,370 --> 03:46:35,730
Up.

2969
03:46:36,390 --> 03:46:36,390
Up.

2970
03:46:37,590 --> 03:46:37,830
Right.

2971
03:46:43,310 --> 03:46:44,030
Left.

2972
03:46:44,770 --> 03:46:44,770
Here.

2973
03:46:46,050 --> 03:46:46,810
Oh, is this?

2974
03:46:47,350 --> 03:46:48,330
Oh, it's here.

2975
03:46:48,850 --> 03:46:49,330
Oh, my God.

2976
03:46:49,470 --> 03:46:49,910
I keep thinking.

2977
03:46:50,090 --> 03:46:51,030
I was thinking about that.

2978
03:46:51,110 --> 03:46:51,230
Okay.

2979
03:46:51,670 --> 03:46:52,030
Up.

2980
03:46:52,790 --> 03:46:53,250
Left.

2981
03:46:56,770 --> 03:46:57,370
Here.

2982
03:46:57,690 --> 03:46:57,690
Okay.

2983
03:46:59,590 --> 03:47:00,250
Left.

2984
03:47:01,350 --> 03:47:01,810
Up.

2985
03:47:11,250 --> 03:47:12,230
Oh, fuck.

2986
03:47:12,910 --> 03:47:13,690
Okay.

2987
03:47:18,270 --> 03:47:18,590
No.

2988
03:47:31,290 --> 03:47:34,010
Now it's over.

2989
03:47:41,390 --> 03:47:43,670
I hit the wall.

2990
03:47:44,210 --> 03:47:47,670
I accidentally hit the wall because I was trying to...

2991
03:47:47,670 --> 03:47:50,330
I was trying to figure out the path being.

2992
03:47:51,290 --> 03:47:52,730
I was trying to...

2993
03:47:53,070 --> 03:47:56,410
I was trying to figure out the path!

2994
03:48:05,750 --> 03:48:08,830
Oh my god.

2995
03:48:11,450 --> 03:48:11,890
Okay.

2996
03:48:28,830 --> 03:48:29,970
I got this.

2997
03:48:31,910 --> 03:48:33,730
I got this.

2998
03:48:37,650 --> 03:48:38,910
I'm locking in.

2999
03:48:45,280 --> 03:48:46,980
I figured it out.

3000
03:48:48,120 --> 03:48:52,280
Well, I know the path thing to get to everywhere, but the citadel path.

3001
03:48:52,420 --> 03:48:53,920
But, like, that's good enough, right?

3002
03:48:54,900 --> 03:48:56,380
I went the wrong way already.

3003
03:48:59,180 --> 03:48:59,200
Alright.

3004
03:49:13,080 --> 03:49:14,660
Okay, up we go.

3005
03:49:15,140 --> 03:49:15,920
Oh, oh, nice.

3006
03:49:20,880 --> 03:49:21,860
Okay, elevator.

3007
03:49:26,560 --> 03:49:27,300
That's fine.

3008
03:49:29,060 --> 03:49:30,940
That scarecrow actually scared me.

3009
03:49:31,080 --> 03:49:31,980
Like, it's working.

3010
03:49:37,600 --> 03:49:40,020
I thought it was a real scarecrow.

3011
03:49:41,240 --> 03:49:42,500
I thought it was a real crow.

3012
03:49:44,600 --> 03:49:45,800
Every time.

3013
03:49:55,500 --> 03:49:56,920
What woke you up?

3014
03:49:59,220 --> 03:50:02,080
Okay, I gotta be gentle with this path.

3015
03:50:04,800 --> 03:50:05,400
Oh.

3016
03:50:06,940 --> 03:50:08,340
Now reset it.

3017
03:50:08,460 --> 03:50:09,520
I gotta reset it.

3018
03:50:15,160 --> 03:50:16,320
Oh my god.

3019
03:50:16,360 --> 03:50:17,180
Oh my god.

3020
03:50:17,800 --> 03:50:18,480
Leave me alone.

3021
03:50:18,760 --> 03:50:19,040
Please.

3022
03:50:20,400 --> 03:50:22,260
What have I done to you guys?

3023
03:50:23,460 --> 03:50:23,820
Okay.

3024
03:50:25,240 --> 03:50:26,520
So far.

3025
03:50:27,580 --> 03:50:28,560
So good.

3026
03:50:37,190 --> 03:50:38,670
Alright, two more hits.

3027
03:50:38,810 --> 03:50:39,550
Two more hits.

3028
03:50:43,440 --> 03:50:45,440
I jinxed myself with that.

3029
03:50:46,380 --> 03:50:47,580
That's on me.

3030
03:50:57,460 --> 03:50:59,490
That's also on me.

3031
03:51:05,040 --> 03:51:06,760
It's still possible.

3032
03:51:11,750 --> 03:51:13,770
Guys, it's so salvageable.

3033
03:51:19,930 --> 03:51:22,230
We can still fix this.

3034
03:51:28,070 --> 03:51:29,410
I figured it out.

3035
03:51:36,240 --> 03:51:38,340
I'm not risking that jump.

3036
03:51:46,610 --> 03:51:48,270
I just gotta have...

3037
03:51:48,970 --> 03:51:50,790
Imagine if the elevator hits me there.

3038
03:51:55,670 --> 03:51:55,730
Alright.

3039
03:51:57,230 --> 03:51:58,250
It's salvageable.

3040
03:51:59,510 --> 03:52:00,650
It's good practice.

3041
03:52:03,250 --> 03:52:04,610
It's for that plus three.

3042
03:52:04,830 --> 03:52:05,470
Oh my god.

3043
03:52:08,090 --> 03:52:09,970
Can't go too fast, guys.

3044
03:52:12,310 --> 03:52:13,950
Never go too fast

3045
03:52:21,720 --> 03:52:37,040
Okay There we go Oh my god Guys I don't know I don't know now I don't think we're gonna make it Oh my god I'm gonna sit down with my head again Okay What was the pathway again?

3046
03:52:37,280 --> 03:52:38,340
Okay left here Okay

3047
03:52:41,720 --> 03:52:42,700
Is it here?

3048
03:52:43,760 --> 03:52:45,600
No No

3049
03:52:53,210 --> 03:52:55,910
No That's...

3050
03:52:55,910 --> 03:52:57,290
It's too late.

3051
03:53:02,180 --> 03:53:03,760
This is hell.

3052
03:53:04,160 --> 03:53:04,820
This is actual hell.

3053
03:53:07,480 --> 03:53:10,000
How is I supposed to know he was above me?

3054
03:53:15,110 --> 03:53:16,710
Where was his blinker?

3055
03:53:17,650 --> 03:53:19,130
His blinker wasn't on.

3056
03:53:19,930 --> 03:53:20,810
Where's the cops?

3057
03:53:22,770 --> 03:53:23,710
Here we go again.

3058
03:53:24,530 --> 03:53:26,790
I figured out the path things for real now.

3059
03:53:36,700 --> 03:53:37,660
All right.

3060
03:53:38,000 --> 03:53:39,400
All right.

3061
03:53:39,440 --> 03:53:40,160
I almost went.

3062
03:53:40,300 --> 03:53:44,160
I almost took the quick, fast, fast.

3063
03:53:46,100 --> 03:53:46,380
All right.

3064
03:53:46,780 --> 03:53:47,640
Full concentration.

3065
03:53:48,220 --> 03:53:48,720
No yapp.

3066
03:53:49,860 --> 03:53:50,340
Oh my god.

3067
03:53:50,480 --> 03:53:50,720
I almost.

3068
03:53:51,040 --> 03:53:51,860
Oh my god.

3069
03:53:51,880 --> 03:53:52,320
Thank god.

3070
03:53:52,420 --> 03:53:53,400
They got, they did a little jump.

3071
03:53:53,520 --> 03:53:54,900
I actually almost hit my head again.

3072
03:54:03,540 --> 03:54:04,340
Full focus.

3073
03:54:18,220 --> 03:54:19,280
Oh my god.

3074
03:54:19,280 --> 03:54:20,280
Oh my god!

3075
03:54:20,580 --> 03:54:21,900
Oh my god!

3076
03:54:22,500 --> 03:54:23,220
I almost hit my head!

3077
03:54:23,840 --> 03:54:25,100
We're right there!

3078
03:54:26,440 --> 03:54:27,560
That was scary.

3079
03:54:33,660 --> 03:54:36,220
Alright, here we go.

3080
03:54:45,550 --> 03:54:45,790
Yeah.

3081
03:54:52,240 --> 03:54:52,600

3086
03:55:11,090 --> 03:55:11,690
Okay.

3087
03:55:12,210 --> 03:55:12,870
Jump here.

3088
03:55:17,170 --> 03:55:19,130
Okay, reset him.

3089
03:55:20,110 --> 03:55:20,810
He's reset.

3090
03:55:26,570 --> 03:55:27,470
No, no!

3091
03:55:29,030 --> 03:55:29,950
Oh, God.

3092
03:55:30,870 --> 03:55:32,130
I might have to reset these guys.

3093
03:55:33,170 --> 03:55:34,310
I messed it up.

3094
03:55:45,420 --> 03:55:45,940
That guy.

3095
03:55:48,040 --> 03:55:48,400
Alright.

3096
03:55:49,180 --> 03:55:49,660

03:55:50,160 --> 03:55:51,300
We got the reset in.

3098
03:55:58,410 --> 03:55:59,010
Okay.

3099
03:55:59,290 --> 03:56:01,010
All right.

03:56:23,450 --> 03:56:23,990
All right.

3105
03:56:24,970 --> 03:56:26,010

03:56:39,150 --> 03:56:40,130
I'm locking in.

3110
03:56:45,990 --> 03:56:50,010

This is already bad.

3122
03:58:33,490 --> 03:58:34,470
Oh this is so bad.

3123
03:58:35,370 --> 03:58:36,610

3124
03:58:36,830 --> 03:58:38,550
I don't know about Pathic.

3125
03:58:38,710 --> 03:58:39,310
This was so bad.

3126
03:58:42,890 --> 03:58:43,870
Where do I go?

3127
03:58:46,430 --> 03:58:46,910
Wait.

3128
03:58:49,390 --> 03:58:50,690

3129
03:59:00,270 --> 03:59:01,630
Wait, how do I do this?

3130
03:59:01,850 --> 03:59:02,990

3131
03:59:16,650 --> 03:59:17,250
Oh my god.

3132
03:59:19,510 --> 03:59:19,930
Oh my god.

3133
03:59:20,450 --> 03:59:20,670
No.

3134
03:59:22,350 --> 03:59:23,210
It's over.

3135
03:59:23,970 --> 03:59:25,250
It's so over.

3136
03:59:30,160 --> 03:59:31,760
It's already so over.

3137
03:59:33,700 --> 03:59:36,300
Oh my god, there was an inside.

3138
03:59:36,920 --> 03:59:38,460

04:00:19,210 --> 04:00:21,630
My head is against the wall.

04:00:23,190 --> 04:00:24,910
I can't.

3143
04:00:28,210 --> 04:00:28,710
I can't.

3144
04:00:28,950 --> 04:00:30,890
This is the one time I use this.

3145
04:00:32,150 --> 04:00:32,590
I...

3146
04:00:33,030 --> 04:00:35,610
I hit my head against the wall.

3147
04:00:36,410 --> 04:00:38,310
You gotta collide.

3148
04:00:43,730 --> 04:00:46,310
I can't believe it.

3149
04:00:48,050 --> 04:00:50,570
I can't believe it.

3150
04:00:53,230 --> 04:00:57,310
It was the fucking door.

3151
04:00:58,290 --> 04:00:59,990
I was the door.

3152
04:01:00,950 --> 04:01:02,550
I was like, it's possible.

3153
04:01:03,090 --> 04:01:04,490
Yes, it's possible.

3154
04:01:08,430 --> 04:01:09,130
I can't...

3155
04:01:09,130 --> 04:01:11,470
I'll be dead for you sake.

3156
04:01:37,370 --> 04:01:38,450
The door.

3157
04:01:39,170 --> 04:01:41,970
It's the fucking...

3158
04:01:41,970 --> 04:01:43,310
It's the door.

3159
04:01:44,070 --> 04:01:46,170
It was the door.

3160
04:01:48,230 --> 04:01:55,810
Oh my god I was doing so well, dude.

3161
04:01:56,870 --> 04:02:04,990
That's the worst part I had zero hits until until I got to the Citadel because I got confused

3162
04:02:08,620 --> 04:02:17,960
It would have been so clutch I was like guys I'm doing it I'm doing and then I got doored

3163
04:02:24,430 --> 04:02:28,410
I felt so confident too.

3164
04:02:32,710 --> 04:02:34,850
The goddamn door!

3165
04:02:36,390 --> 04:02:37,630
Oh my god.

3166
04:02:38,690 --> 04:02:40,430
Door stuck.

3167
04:02:41,710 --> 04:02:45,470
I felt like, I felt so cool.

3168
04:02:53,540 --> 04:02:56,260
It's not up, not when you go in.

3169
04:02:58,820 --> 04:03:00,300
It's up, not right?

3170
04:03:00,380 --> 04:03:01,700
When you go into that room?

3171
04:03:01,840 --> 04:03:02,340
What do you mean?

3172
04:03:08,090 --> 04:03:08,650
Oops.

3173
04:03:09,790 --> 04:03:10,230
Oh my gosh.

3174
04:03:10,510 --> 04:03:12,470
I've already messed up this.

3175
04:03:16,130 --> 04:03:17,550
I don't know what that means.

3176
04:03:19,630 --> 04:03:21,270
It's right then up.

3177
04:03:22,170 --> 04:03:23,050
Oh, what does that mean?

3178
04:03:25,050 --> 04:03:26,110
Speak English!

3179
04:03:31,950 --> 04:03:35,050
Don't keep, we are speaking English, though.

3180
04:03:36,270 --> 04:03:37,190
Speak English!

3181
04:03:42,510 --> 04:03:44,130
Okay, all right

3182
04:03:50,820 --> 04:03:55,640
Okay Now we're here

3183
04:04:04,230 --> 04:04:06,810
All right, double jump this

3184
04:04:11,840 --> 04:04:14,640
All right Now we're back here

3185
04:04:18,730 --> 04:04:22,530
Oh, now we're back here hitting

3186
04:04:44,340 --> 04:04:48,520
the edge of the fucking hip-hop It's okay, we're fine.

3187
04:04:48,860 --> 04:04:49,260
We're fine.

3188
04:04:49,580 --> 04:04:50,320
I don't know.

3189
04:04:50,500 --> 04:04:50,820
I don't know.

3190
04:04:50,880 --> 04:04:51,740
I found the edge.

3191
04:04:52,300 --> 04:04:54,020
I found the hitbox edge.

3192
04:05:05,450 --> 04:05:06,450
I just... this?

3193
04:05:06,670 --> 04:05:06,910
No.

3194
04:05:07,190 --> 04:05:07,830
That's just nothing.

3195
04:05:09,330 --> 04:05:10,090
Uh, confused.

3196
04:05:19,370 --> 04:05:19,650
Okay.

3197
04:05:20,190 --> 04:05:20,710
Here we go.

3198
04:05:21,290 --> 04:05:22,670
I actually thread that needle.

3199
04:05:28,750 --> 04:05:30,010
And then it ain't tricking me.

3200
04:05:30,010 --> 04:05:32,090
I know there's a step over there.

3201
04:05:33,750 --> 04:05:34,110
What?

3202
04:05:38,890 --> 04:05:39,730
My god.

3203
04:05:39,750 --> 04:05:42,750

A dish to match my master's finest desires.

3304
04:15:59,600 --> 04:16:00,660
The pale truffle is yours.

3305

Take care of leave.

3306
04:16:01,960 --> 04:16:05,620
My master needs time to reflect, and I must ponder on flavors on you.

3307

This is a victory lap.

3326
04:17:31,010 --> 04:17:32,630
We don't need a save and quit.

3327
04:17:32,730 --> 04:17:35,590
I'm doing my victory lap right now.

3328
04:17:39,070 --> 04:17:40,990

3348
04:19:12,890 --> 04:19:14,710
I didn't know.

Okay, let me just put Umarang.

3367
04:20:05,350 --> 04:20:09,010
Um Oh my god, who cannot farm?

3368
04:20:10,010 --> 04:20:12,990

3369
04:20:15,690 --> 04:20:18,470
Oh my god, I'm gonna beat this guy up.

3370
04:20:19,410 --> 04:20:20,850
He was like, hello.

Oh my god, it's just 12.

3374
04:20:35,630 --> 04:20:36,350
It's not worth it.

3375
04:20:36,450 --> 04:20:36,930
It's 12.

3376
04:20:38,050 --> 04:20:39,570

3379
04:20:49,700 --> 04:20:51,740
As well as where I farm the money.

3380
04:20:53,140 --> 04:20:55,000
No, I can do...

3381
04:20:55,000 --> 04:20:56,700
No, this is...

3382
04:20:56,700 --> 04:20:57,860
This is faster.

3383
04:21:01,420 --> 04:21:02,080
This is faster.

3384
04:21:05,960 --> 04:21:07,020
I go here.

3385
04:21:07,900 --> 04:21:09,080
And I go...

3386
04:21:09,080 --> 04:21:09,620
I need this!

3387
04:21:10,480 --> 04:21:11,960
And then I got my money.

3388
04:21:12,240 --> 04:21:12,460
See?

3389
04:21:13,160 --> 04:21:14,760
It's so much faster.

3390
04:21:18,670 --> 04:21:20,150
Everything for plus three.

3391
04:21:23,590 --> 04:21:24,750
There's the stuff I...

3392
04:21:24,770 --> 04:21:25,290
I do.

3393
04:21:26,290 --> 04:21:27,310
We're plus three.

3394
04:21:28,090 --> 04:21:29,410
Oh my god, I don't have Adidas anymore.

3395
04:21:30,410 --> 04:21:32,670
My entire plan relied on Adidas.

3396
04:21:38,430 --> 04:21:39,450
It's fine.

3397
04:21:40,450 --> 04:21:41,350
It's so faster.

3398
04:21:46,660 --> 04:21:48,040
I do this.

3399
04:21:50,560 --> 04:21:51,220
Adidas!

3400
04:21:53,800 --> 04:21:54,960
Alright, nice.

3401
04:21:55,960 --> 04:21:57,820
How much is 430 or 450?

3402
04:21:58,480 --> 04:21:59,320
How much was it?

3403
04:22:05,490 --> 04:22:06,110
450?

3404
04:22:06,410 --> 04:22:07,020
All right, one more.

3405
04:22:08,510 --> 04:22:09,130
Adidas!

3406
04:22:10,270 --> 04:22:11,270
There you go.

3407
04:22:12,890 --> 04:22:14,090
All right, that should be enough.

3408
04:22:15,010 --> 04:22:16,470
Now I'm broke, broke.

3409
04:22:22,360 --> 04:22:22,840
Bellheart.

3410
04:22:23,320 --> 04:22:24,200
I hate that Bellheart.

3411
04:22:25,660 --> 04:22:27,180
I hate Bellheart so much.

3412
04:22:29,540 --> 04:22:31,060
It's like going to LA.

3413
04:22:33,140 --> 04:22:34,840
Fucking expensive as fuck.

3414
04:22:41,310 --> 04:22:42,190
All right.

3415
04:22:44,750 --> 04:22:46,030
I'm a constant state of broke.

3416
04:22:47,510 --> 04:22:49,030
Trapping my needle.

3417
04:22:49,950 --> 04:22:51,290
You do what you hoard.

3418
04:22:52,050 --> 04:22:53,990
You capitalist pig.

3419
04:22:55,110 --> 04:22:55,630
Do it.

3420
04:22:59,550 --> 04:22:59,830
Whoa.

3421
04:23:00,610 --> 04:23:02,930
He's like looping up my sword.

3422
04:23:05,290 --> 04:23:07,250
But this is a new cutscene.

3423
04:23:13,700 --> 04:23:13,960
Nice.

3424
04:23:14,460 --> 04:23:15,720
Well, he's done.

3425
04:23:16,300 --> 04:23:17,100
What miracle did it work?

3426
04:23:17,120 --> 04:24:18,700
again upon steel so fine few pins left and formerly contained such she you must tell me traveler whatever did you come upon such splendid weapon the blade was a gift gifted by a noble tribe of my homeland they forged the strongest so seal those are seen beyond their hive the tribe has now long passed with them the secret to their craft oh they're gone swear peace then will be guessed but what grand luck for this humble pin master that worked with such a a weapon all right oh is that the same cutscene i must have accidentally skipped the cutscene three times i think i actually skipped the cutscene three fucking times all right now we can progress the story let's actually do we do this i assume all of these are like boss fights so which one would be the closest i knew any of them i'll do this one This is the closest.

3427
04:24:25,670 --> 04:24:27,550
Oh, yeah, I'll do the one at the bottom.

3428
04:24:28,390 --> 04:24:29,730
This seems like the closest.

3429
04:24:32,490 --> 04:24:33,410
I'll go here.

3430
04:24:34,190 --> 04:24:35,690
Cogswork is the easiest one.

3431
04:24:35,870 --> 04:24:36,710
Which one's Cogswork?

3432
04:24:37,330 --> 04:24:38,230
Do they have names?

3433
04:24:39,090 --> 04:24:39,910
Oh, they do.

3434
04:24:52,470 --> 04:24:55,970
Guys, I'll fight Beastfly next stream.

3435
04:24:56,250 --> 04:24:57,490
Okay, I promise you.

3436
04:24:57,610 --> 04:25:00,050
Next stream, I'll fight Beastfly.

3437
04:25:02,410 --> 04:25:03,370
Architect's memory?

3438
04:25:04,050 --> 04:25:04,050
Okay.

3439
04:25:09,080 --> 04:25:09,960
Architect's memory.

3440
04:25:10,780 --> 04:25:12,700
Which one was the symbol for it?

3441
04:25:13,840 --> 04:25:14,600
It's this one.

3442
04:25:14,720 --> 04:25:15,200
Oh, okay.

3443
04:25:15,280 --> 04:25:16,720
So I should do that one then.

3444
04:25:17,820 --> 04:25:18,780
This is the easiest?

3445
04:25:25,050 --> 04:25:26,070
Is this the easiest?

3446
04:25:29,520 --> 04:25:30,720
Alright, I'll do that.

3447
04:25:33,260 --> 04:25:33,740
Alright.

3448
04:25:43,070 --> 04:25:45,270
I want to do a boss fight, though.

3449
04:25:45,890 --> 04:25:46,750
Is it not a boss fight?

3450
04:25:46,770 --> 04:25:47,030
fight?

3451
04:26:03,170 --> 04:26:04,590
Oh, none of them are?

3452
04:26:06,110 --> 04:26:09,630
Oh, oh, this one?

3453
04:26:09,990 --> 04:26:11,630
This is the boss fight?

3454
04:26:11,750 --> 04:26:13,250
Okay, we'll go to the right one then.

3455
04:26:21,910 --> 04:26:23,610
I'll do the boss fight then.

3456
04:26:28,620 --> 04:26:29,220
Wee!

3457
04:26:30,680 --> 04:26:32,000
There is a shortcut.

3458
04:26:34,320 --> 04:26:36,420
No, I will not talk to you.

3459
04:26:45,860 --> 04:27:12,480

3460
04:27:16,600 --> 04:27:19,380
I hate these guys so much.

3461
04:27:22,540 --> 04:27:23,460
Oh, but they're so...

3462
04:27:23,460 --> 04:27:24,780
They died out faster, though.

3463
04:27:24,880 --> 04:27:26,140
Thank fucking God.

3464
04:27:31,330 --> 04:27:33,130
Actually, let's see what's over here.

3465
04:27:35,030 --> 04:27:36,490
I haven't explored here yet.

3466
04:27:38,010 --> 04:27:39,170
Oh, absolutely nothing.

3467
04:27:39,770 --> 04:27:40,290
That's cool.

3468
04:27:50,530 --> 04:27:51,210
Whoops, sorry.

3469
04:27:51,450 --> 04:27:52,250
Am I interrupting something?

3470
04:27:52,490 --> 04:27:52,830
It's okay.

3471
04:28:01,630 --> 04:28:03,410
Come on, guys.

3472
04:28:03,750 --> 04:28:04,170
Come back.

3473
04:28:08,870 --> 04:28:10,070
Come on.

3474
04:28:10,710 --> 04:28:11,610
Back here.

3475
04:28:13,750 --> 04:28:15,210
There we go.

3476
04:28:17,210 --> 04:28:17,910
That's right.

3477
04:28:18,230 --> 04:28:19,530
What you gotta do now?

3478
04:28:19,810 --> 04:28:20,770
He's dead.

3479
04:28:22,830 --> 04:28:23,530
That's right.

3480
04:28:24,930 --> 04:28:25,910
You're gonna hit me.

3481
04:28:26,170 --> 04:28:27,230
I mean, that works too.

3482
04:28:28,150 --> 04:28:29,130
What the fuck were they guard?

3483
04:28:29,210 --> 04:28:30,290
Oh, shortcut.

3484
04:28:31,730 --> 04:28:32,530
I see.

3485
04:28:32,710 --> 04:28:34,450
I was like, what are they guarding down there?

3486
04:28:35,430 --> 04:28:36,690
There's like nothing here.

3487
04:28:43,530 --> 04:28:44,950
What's this guy?

3488
04:28:46,010 --> 04:28:46,930
Oh my god.

3489
04:28:47,130 --> 04:28:47,710
Fuck you.

3490
04:28:50,430 --> 04:28:51,790
What are you here then?

3491
04:28:54,270 --> 04:28:55,890
What does this do?

3492
04:29:00,900 --> 04:29:01,780
What?

3493
04:29:03,280 --> 04:29:04,460
What is this for?

3494
04:29:08,680 --> 04:29:09,400
Huh?

3495
04:29:13,610 --> 04:29:14,210
Oh!

3496
04:29:17,410 --> 04:29:20,410
That's right, you can't hide money from me.

3497
04:29:22,090 --> 04:29:24,630
Wait, I'm still confused.

3498
04:29:28,750 --> 04:29:30,110
Haha, that's right.

3499
04:29:35,900 --> 04:29:37,320
Can't hide the money.

3500
04:29:37,340 --> 04:29:38,340
money from me.

3501
04:29:42,350 --> 04:29:43,170
Go up.

3502
04:29:43,870 --> 04:29:44,890
What did I do?

3503
04:29:48,670 --> 04:29:50,150
Secret top right.

3504
04:29:51,650 --> 04:29:52,250
Here?

3505
04:30:01,040 --> 04:30:03,020
That's what it was for.

3506
04:30:03,600 --> 04:30:06,040
I was like wondering what that thing was.

3507
04:30:06,860 --> 04:30:07,540
What did I do?

3508
04:30:15,020 --> 04:30:15,480
Wee!

3509
04:30:17,060 --> 04:30:18,180
Just hang out.

3510
04:30:24,880 --> 04:30:26,160
That's my bad.

3511
04:30:26,500 --> 04:30:27,560
That's actually my bad.

3512
04:30:27,920 --> 04:30:28,880
Oh my god.

3513
04:30:37,930 --> 04:30:38,870
What is over here?

3514
04:30:39,270 --> 04:30:40,370
Where am I?

3515
04:30:46,690 --> 04:30:47,650
Where am I?

3516
04:30:48,830 --> 04:30:50,290
Down I'll go.

3517
04:30:54,370 --> 04:30:55,090
Wee.

3518
04:30:55,470 --> 04:30:56,190
Wee.

3519
04:30:57,850 --> 04:30:58,050
Oh!

3520
04:30:59,150 --> 04:30:59,870
Wee.

3521
04:31:02,570 --> 04:31:04,110
Where did I go?

3522
04:31:04,390 --> 04:31:05,710
miss it!

3523
04:31:08,610 --> 04:31:10,350
Oh my god!

3524
04:31:10,590 --> 04:31:11,150
Where am I?

3525
04:31:11,370 --> 04:31:11,530
Where?

3526
04:31:21,310 --> 04:31:23,030
What is this hell?

3527
04:31:24,250 --> 04:31:25,510
Oh no.

3528
04:31:25,950 --> 04:31:29,150
This is poison swamps, isn't it?

3529
04:31:31,510 --> 04:31:34,810
This is poison swamps, isn't it?

3530
04:31:34,930 --> 04:31:37,210
Oh my god.

3531
04:31:40,410 --> 04:31:43,170
Oh my god.

3532
04:31:46,910 --> 04:31:49,090
I'm actually at Poison Swamps.

3533
04:31:49,270 --> 04:31:54,290
I'm actually there I'm actually there

3534
04:32:05,530 --> 04:32:08,230
Where did I go?

3535
04:32:09,010 --> 04:32:09,990
Where am I?

3536
04:32:11,370 --> 04:32:22,870
I don't even know how to get back So either I don't I don't have one.

3537
04:32:24,980 --> 04:32:26,980
I ate them all.

3538
04:32:27,740 --> 04:32:30,180
They were just so good.

3539
04:32:31,920 --> 04:32:34,880
I ate all of my silk.

3540
04:32:37,740 --> 04:32:40,780
Alright, let's figure out how to get there again.

3541
04:32:43,910 --> 04:32:45,770
I don't remember.

3542
04:32:50,410 --> 04:32:55,850
I think it was like this way and then this way.

3543
04:32:55,870 --> 04:32:56,350
it?

3544
04:32:57,550 --> 04:32:58,170
No, it wasn't.

3545
04:32:58,250 --> 04:32:59,650
I've never even been here before.

3546
04:33:03,010 --> 04:33:06,590
No, I need a... I missed something though, didn't I?

3547
04:33:07,270 --> 04:33:08,510
What did I miss?

3548
04:33:18,860 --> 04:33:20,280
Didn't I miss something?

3549
04:33:23,260 --> 04:33:26,540
Yeah, I want to see if I can get back to where the fuck I missed.

3550
04:33:32,540 --> 04:33:34,080
Okay, so how do we do this?

3551
04:33:34,720 --> 04:33:35,140
Guys.

3552
04:33:36,200 --> 04:33:36,640
Okay.

3553
04:33:49,460 --> 04:33:51,840
Hug the left wall.

3554
04:33:59,810 --> 04:34:01,050
Wow, look at all these gears.

3555
04:34:01,230 --> 04:34:02,510
I didn't turn on.

3556
04:34:04,450 --> 04:34:04,790
Wait.

3557
04:34:17,360 --> 04:34:18,320
Alright.

3558
04:34:22,950 --> 04:34:24,010
Here we go.

3559

What can I lose when I have nothing?

3644
04:43:12,540 --> 04:43:14,720
Truly is such a sad moment.

3645
04:43:16,740 --> 04:43:17,100
Exactly.

3646
04:43:17,580 --> 04:43:18,820
Nothing of value was lost.

3647
04:43:28,150 --> 04:43:29,730
I missed a shortcut.

3648
04:43:30,170 --> 04:43:30,710
That's fine.

3649
04:43:30,870 --> 04:43:32,070
We don't need shortcuts.

3650
04:43:33,610 --> 04:43:36,390
Life is not about shortcuts, guys.

3651
04:43:42,050 --> 04:43:46,570

3675
04:45:35,100 --> 04:45:36,760

3676
04:45:37,740 --> 04:45:39,540

3677
04:45:39,820 --> 04:45:40,460
Guys.

3678
04:45:42,760 --> 04:45:43,020
Nice.

3679
04:45:43,200 --> 04:45:45,060

3680
04:45:46,660 --> 04:45:47,460
There we go.

3681
04:45:54,090 --> 04:45:54,810
There I go.

3682
04:45:56,210 --> 04:45:57,830
How do we open that pathway?

3683
04:45:58,930 --> 04:46:00,290
Wait, I should have to do this.

3684
04:46:10,370 --> 04:46:14,310
Oh, great lad who's flamed, doth falter, who's quiet, conducted, all doth fall.

3685
04:46:15,590 --> 04:46:16,550
Observe, take heart.

3686
04:46:18,190 --> 04:46:19,330
That spark's still burning.

3687
04:46:19,830 --> 04:46:22,010
You'll be on butterfly of crimson grace.

3688
04:46:22,250 --> 04:46:37,610
A bell shall peel and voices raised When brave Trobio steps at last Upon the sage Alright Please tell me there's a bench Please tell me there's a bench Somewhere

3689
04:46:41,070 --> 04:46:50,100

Alright, let me check my items real quick.

3693
04:47:22,710 --> 04:47:24,630
See if I have everything I want to equip.

3694
04:47:28,560 --> 04:47:28,940
Alright.

3695
04:47:31,940 --> 04:47:33,280
That's fine.

3696
04:47:34,740 --> 04:47:37,560
This run back is not that bad.

3697
04:47:37,880 --> 04:47:38,580
Oh my god.

3698
04:47:38,720 --> 04:47:39,280
Okay, fine.

3699
04:47:39,540 --> 04:47:41,380
I won't use you as a platform.

3700
04:47:44,140 --> 04:47:44,660
Alright.

3701
04:47:45,240 --> 04:47:46,100
Oh, I could have...

3702
04:47:46,100 --> 04:47:46,800
Oh, you're right.

3703
04:47:46,920 --> 04:47:48,000
I could have equipped the dice.

3704
04:47:49,720 --> 04:47:50,920
Yeah, I'm going to...

3705
04:47:50,920 --> 04:47:51,280
Okay.

3706
04:47:52,880 --> 04:47:54,400
I'm going to equip the dice.

3707
04:47:55,480 --> 04:47:57,020
Let me farm these guys for silk, too.

3708
04:48:05,950 --> 04:48:06,470
Alright.

3709
04:48:07,710 --> 04:48:08,170
There we go.

3710
04:48:08,450 --> 04:48:09,810
I need a silk anyway.

3711
04:48:11,010 --> 04:48:13,130
I'm going to equip my dice.

3712
04:48:16,150 --> 04:48:19,210
Because I don't need this anymore.

3713
04:48:21,530 --> 04:48:22,210
What else do I want to do?

3714
04:48:22,230 --> 04:48:22,570
Oh, yeah.

3715
04:48:25,150 --> 04:48:26,810
I'll use the parry.

3716
04:48:28,670 --> 04:48:29,790
Parry might be good.

3717
04:48:34,830 --> 04:48:35,170
Alright.

3718
04:48:35,510 --> 04:48:38,090
I have silky now.

3719
04:48:38,170 --> 04:48:39,430
So it can't be that bad.

3720
04:48:41,450 --> 04:48:41,870
Alright.

3721
04:48:42,190 --> 04:48:42,890

3738
04:49:55,990 --> 04:49:56,590

I...

3740
04:49:59,590 --> 04:50:01,070
Might hate this boss.

3741
04:50:04,370 --> 04:50:05,270
I think...

3742
04:50:05,570 --> 04:50:07,670
I think I hate this boss, guys.

3743
04:50:10,110 --> 04:50:10,710
I...

3744
04:50:14,520 --> 04:50:15,900
Remember when I tell you?

3745
04:50:16,000 --> 04:50:18,160
My biggest weakness is random bullshit?

3746
04:50:18,620 --> 04:50:19,100
Yeah!

3747
04:50:19,780 --> 04:50:27,810
Oh my god, did they?

3748
04:50:29,710 --> 04:50:30,630
I hate this.

3749
04:50:31,150 --> 04:50:32,460
I actually hate this.

3750
04:50:43,730 --> 04:50:45,530
Jesus Christ, look at it.

3751
04:50:47,170 --> 04:50:47,910
Trubio!

3752
04:50:49,450 --> 04:50:49,770
Trubio!

3753
04:50:49,770 --> 04:50:50,610
Ha ha!

3754
04:50:52,930 --> 04:50:54,570
Oh my god.

3755
04:50:57,050 --> 04:50:57,990
Trubio!

3756
04:50:58,110 --> 04:51:03,910
Oh my god, he actually destroys my chainsaw.

3757
04:51:04,370 --> 04:51:05,430
What a fucking freak.

3758
04:51:11,970 --> 04:51:13,310
Oh my god, of course, that hits me.

3759
04:51:15,910 --> 04:51:16,230
Trovio!

3760
04:51:18,950 --> 04:51:20,050
Stupid Trovio.

3761
04:51:21,970 --> 04:51:27,610
Oh my god, he keeps breaking my chainsaw.

3762
04:51:36,040 --> 04:51:37,260
Oh my god.

3763
04:51:38,000 --> 04:51:39,800
Chainsaw does not do well against Trovio.

3764
04:51:41,820 --> 04:51:43,180
Ooh, what I thought.

3765
04:51:44,060 --> 04:51:45,060
Are you serious?

3766
04:51:45,360 --> 04:51:46,320
Stupid Trobio.

3767
04:51:46,600 --> 04:51:47,980
Stupid Trobio!

3768
04:51:54,580 --> 04:51:58,960
Oh my god, I actually got scared.

3769
04:52:03,830 --> 04:52:03,990
Huh?

3770
04:52:08,630 --> 04:52:10,270
Oh my god, stupid random bullshit.

3771
04:52:11,750 --> 04:52:17,150
Oh my god.

3772
04:52:17,350 --> 04:52:17,630
Okay.

3773
04:52:19,490 --> 04:52:20,690
Chainsaw does nothing.

3774
04:52:20,710 --> 04:52:22,230
against Trobio.

3775
04:52:24,250 --> 04:52:27,070
Trobio does not see weapons.

3776
04:52:34,310 --> 04:52:34,570
Yeah.

3777
04:52:35,010 --> 04:52:37,930
I want to grab some fucking scraps real quick.

3778
04:52:40,010 --> 04:52:41,010
I don't have shards.

3779
04:52:41,770 --> 04:52:44,210
I might have to fight this boss with no tools.

3780
04:52:45,450 --> 04:52:46,630
Except for my...

3781
04:52:46,630 --> 04:52:48,070
My flea flea juice.

3782
04:52:52,090 --> 04:52:52,730
Whoops.

3783
04:52:53,330 --> 04:52:54,590
Oh hey, didn't do anything.

3784
04:52:56,590 --> 04:52:58,290
All right, that was an accident.

3785
04:53:05,420 --> 04:53:05,880
Oh, wait.

3786
04:53:06,160 --> 04:53:07,440
I think I should use the Perry.

3787
04:53:07,840 --> 04:53:11,060
Ah, does Perry work against his twirls, guys?

3788
04:53:18,270 --> 04:53:21,070
Does Perry work against the...

3789
04:53:22,310 --> 04:53:22,950
Yeah?

3790
04:53:23,290 --> 04:53:23,530
Okay.

3791
04:53:25,390 --> 04:53:25,910
All right, Perry.

3792
04:53:26,330 --> 04:53:27,950
I hate you, Trubio.

3793
04:53:28,890 --> 04:53:31,390
Trubio, I fucking hate you so much.

3794
04:53:33,210 --> 04:53:34,670
I hate you.

3795
04:53:35,030 --> 04:53:36,050
Oh, my.

3796
04:53:36,070 --> 04:53:37,030
I've got Trubio!

3797
04:53:39,230 --> 04:53:39,230
Stop!

3798
04:53:51,200 --> 04:53:52,360
I hate him.

3799
04:53:52,580 --> 04:53:54,060
I hate him.

3800
04:54:00,720 --> 04:54:01,060
Okay.

3801
04:54:02,600 --> 04:54:03,880
I'm not using anything.

3802
04:54:09,930 --> 04:54:10,570
Okay, nice.

3803
04:54:14,270 --> 04:54:16,770
Oh, I can hate hit the bombs.

3804
04:54:16,990 --> 04:54:18,210
Okay, that's good to know.

3805
04:54:19,850 --> 04:54:20,490
Alright.

3806
04:54:21,350 --> 04:54:22,750
I'm locking in then.

3807
04:54:29,110 --> 04:54:31,530
No wonder they cancelled your show.

3808
04:54:32,010 --> 04:54:32,470
Trobeo.

3809
04:54:33,090 --> 04:54:35,540
No wonder they locked you up and cancelled it.

3810
04:54:44,040 --> 04:54:45,640
I thought it hit.

3811
04:54:46,820 --> 04:54:47,820
I thought it hit.

3812
04:54:48,880 --> 04:54:49,360
Oh, Mac.

3813
04:54:49,560 --> 04:54:50,240
I hate you.

3814
04:54:50,660 --> 04:54:54,400
I actually hate you so much.

3815
04:54:56,800 --> 04:54:57,460
Trobeo.

3816
04:55:14,590 --> 04:55:15,250
Trobeo.

3817
04:55:15,250 --> 04:55:15,530
Trobeo.

3818
04:55:16,470 --> 04:55:16,990
I don't

3819
04:55:20,850 --> 04:55:21,270
know.

3820
04:55:21,410 --> 04:55:21,990
That's fine.

3821
04:55:29,520 --> 04:55:30,020
There you go.

3822
04:55:30,480 --> 04:55:32,040
Oh my god, fucking course.

3823
04:55:32,460 --> 04:55:33,780
A fucking course, you whore.

3824
04:55:38,740 --> 04:55:40,340
Stupid tornado ass.

3825
04:55:42,940 --> 04:55:43,500
Troobio!

3826
04:55:49,640 --> 04:55:50,520
Alright, night.

3827
04:55:50,700 --> 04:55:53,080
I will say that was a nice dodge.

3828
04:55:54,280 --> 04:55:54,900
Stupid Troobio.

3829
04:56:04,280 --> 04:56:04,780
There you go.

3830
04:56:11,290 --> 04:56:12,110
Are you serious?

3831
04:56:13,210 --> 04:56:14,490
Oh my god, that was an accident.

3832
04:56:15,630 --> 04:56:15,970
fast.

3833
04:56:16,250 --> 04:56:17,130
I was so fast.

3834
04:56:17,610 --> 04:56:19,810
I Oh my god, I was not used to speed.

3835
04:56:20,370 --> 04:56:22,350
Okay, I'm not using the lead juice, guys.

3836
04:56:23,010 --> 04:56:23,910
I was too fast.

3837
04:56:24,650 --> 04:56:26,090
The speed actually fucked me up.

3838
04:56:27,890 --> 04:56:30,510
The speed actually fucked me up there.

3839
04:56:38,540 --> 04:56:39,060
Okay.

3840
04:56:43,170 --> 04:56:44,310
Oh my god.

3841
04:56:47,290 --> 04:56:47,950
Okay, nice.

3842
04:56:52,250 --> 04:56:54,510

04:57:00,130 --> 04:57:00,570
Oh!

3845
04:57:00,570 --> 04:57:01,390
What's the flint?

3846
04:57:01,610 --> 04:57:03,110
I don't even know what the flint is.

3847
04:57:03,590 --> 04:57:04,030
Alright.

3848
04:57:04,930 --> 04:57:05,290

Oh my god, I got stomped so high.

3851
04:57:13,490 --> 04:57:14,630

Oh, I don't have it.

3853
04:57:15,690 --> 04:57:17,090

04:57:32,650 --> 04:57:32,970
Okay.

Yeah, I need the compass, guys.

3860
04:57:36,430 --> 04:57:37,090
You don't understand.

Stupid Trubio.

3925
05:04:11,330 --> 05:04:13,570
Such a dedicated actor.

3926
05:04:17,050 --> 05:04:18,610
So dramatic.

3927
05:04:19,870 --> 05:04:21,230
Wait, what does it look like?

3928
05:04:23,230 --> 05:04:23,610
Oh!

3929
05:04:24,290 --> 05:04:27,130
He's so dramatic, silly Trubio.

3930
05:04:30,170 --> 05:04:31,690
Oh, that's a shortcut.

3931
05:04:33,190 --> 05:04:35,590
He's so committed.

3932
05:04:36,290 --> 05:04:38,790
Where does

3933
05:04:44,190 --> 05:04:44,750
this go?

3934
05:04:54,110 --> 05:04:55,490
I'm so scared.

3935
05:04:56,510 --> 05:04:59,170
Like, I keep going down, I'm like scared.

3936
05:05:00,490 --> 05:05:01,470
Oh, I broke that.

3937
05:05:06,530 --> 05:05:07,330
What now?

3938
05:05:09,410 --> 05:05:10,130
Wait, what?

3939
05:05:14,090 --> 05:05:16,570
Guys, what about this?

3940
05:05:17,950 --> 05:05:18,710
Guys.

3941
05:05:22,220 --> 05:05:26,520
So that was optional, wasn't it?

3942
05:05:28,520 --> 05:05:31,160
Did you make me do an optional boss fight?

3943
05:05:44,640 --> 05:05:45,480
That...

3944
05:05:45,480 --> 05:05:45,960
Guys.

3945
05:05:50,520 --> 05:05:52,200
I said...

3946
05:05:52,200 --> 05:05:53,060
I don't...

3947
05:05:53,060 --> 05:05:55,320
Well, I don't think he's optional.

3948
05:05:55,740 --> 05:05:56,140
Guys.

3949
05:05:56,940 --> 05:05:58,640
The troveo is...

3950
05:05:58,640 --> 05:05:59,780
No, you don't understand.

3951
05:06:00,160 --> 05:06:01,160
He is...

3952
05:06:01,180 --> 05:06:02,020
optional.

3953
05:06:03,000 --> 05:06:04,740
Yeah, he is a mandatory.

3954
05:06:08,200 --> 05:06:09,100
I... Oh.

3955
05:06:12,040 --> 05:06:12,880
Troobio!

3956
05:06:13,840 --> 05:06:15,800
Takedo, thank you for the super chat.

3957
05:06:16,020 --> 05:06:16,900
Thank you.

3958
05:06:17,400 --> 05:06:18,920
Oh, my God.

3959
05:06:21,580 --> 05:06:24,180
He's not optional to me, Toki!

3960
05:06:28,400 --> 05:06:34,940
He is a mandatory How do I go under the elevator?

3961
05:06:35,800 --> 05:06:36,900
He's not a option.

3962
05:06:37,520 --> 05:06:38,880
My Artuki!

3963
05:06:39,820 --> 05:06:40,400
Tropio!

3964
05:06:44,040 --> 05:06:46,660
I didn't go under that elevator?

3965
05:06:46,900 --> 05:06:48,980
How the fuck do I go under that elevator?

3966
05:06:55,080 --> 05:06:56,580
Oh, send it down.

3967
05:06:56,860 --> 05:06:56,960
Ops.

3968
05:06:57,620 --> 05:06:57,920
Ow.

3969
05:07:08,050 --> 05:07:10,190
It is mandatory in our heart.

3970
05:07:10,490 --> 05:07:11,150
The real thing.

3971
05:07:11,350 --> 05:07:12,390
Even the super chat thing.

3972
05:07:12,550 --> 05:07:13,430
Thank you.

3973
05:07:16,790 --> 05:07:17,730
Then send it up.

3974
05:07:17,810 --> 05:07:18,890
How do I send it up?

3975
05:07:19,010 --> 05:07:20,470
Oh, I just climb it up.

3976
05:07:27,370 --> 05:07:27,430
Oh!

3977
05:07:28,590 --> 05:07:29,450
Go up.

3978
05:07:29,890 --> 05:07:31,550
I didn't see the lever, guys.

3979
05:07:36,590 --> 05:07:37,170
There we go.

3980
05:07:42,220 --> 05:07:43,520
My eyes, they don't see.

3981
05:07:44,620 --> 05:07:46,200
I don't see levers.

3982
05:07:56,190 --> 05:07:57,490
There she has bugs.

3983
05:08:10,190 --> 05:08:10,910
Alright.

3984
05:08:12,870 --> 05:08:13,010
Trobio.

3985
05:08:13,150 --> 05:08:16,190
Trobio would have seen the loud- well, Trobio's dead!

3986
05:08:16,570 --> 05:08:19,370
His- his acting career, that is.

3987
05:08:24,570 --> 05:08:26,610
His acting career is dead.

3988
05:08:26,710 --> 05:08:27,910
He might as well be dead.

3989
05:08:29,870 --> 05:08:31,710
You take that back, Tokey.

3990
05:08:33,010 --> 05:08:33,730
Oh.

3991
05:08:34,490 --> 05:08:34,970

Oh.

3995
05:08:37,830 --> 05:08:43,690
Yeah, critics say his acting may or may not be mediocre.

3996
05:08:47,970 --> 05:08:50,430
You put respect to his name.

3997
05:08:50,930 --> 05:08:52,010
It's Trubio!

3998
05:08:56,430 --> 05:08:57,670
All right, there's this stuff.

3999
05:08:58,950 --> 05:08:59,450
Nice view.

4001
05:09:02,010 --> 05:09:04,250
I'll first need to find a working device to play it.

4002
05:09:04,370 --> 05:09:06,310

Apparently I was not faster.

Oh, I thought I could kill him too.

4016
05:10:41,960 --> 05:10:43,060
I thought a lot of things.

4045
05:11:48,360 --> 05:11:50,120

05:11:51,240 --> 05:11:54,100

05:11:54,240 --> 05:11:54,860

05:11:55,160 --> 05:11:55,320
