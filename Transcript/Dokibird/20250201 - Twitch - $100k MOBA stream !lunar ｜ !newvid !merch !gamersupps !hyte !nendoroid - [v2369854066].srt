1
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:23,590
I don't know how you guys might be like, what the fuck?

2
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,830
It's okay, I used our one.

3
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,110
One down, one down, one to go.

4
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,550
It already started.

5
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,490
I mean, what's going on here?

6
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:42,110
Okay, so like, we're told we can only have two F-bombs.

7
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:42,750
F -bombs.

8
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,910
And the whole stream.

9
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,150
For all of us.

10
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,490
I don't think it was just that, you know.

11
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,450
It was just natural.

12
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,110
I couldn't help it.

13
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,710
It's been a week since I streamed.

14
00:21:58,770 --> 00:21:59,890
I couldn't help it.

15
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,030
I need to get it out.

16
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:07,850
So it's not like two out of each of us.

17
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:10,510
It's two in the entire stream from all of us here.

18
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,190
And you're like, what do you mean by all of us?

19
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,050
It's just you and me.

20
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:17,930
No, we actually have a mysterious third person here with us today.

21
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:18,410
What?

22
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:19,070
That's me.

23
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,090
Hi, I'm a mysterious person.

24
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,870
I'm Fulham, for those of you who don't know me.

25
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:27,970
I also don't have a VTuber model because I'm not a VTuber.

26
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,230
I'm the Minecraft guy.

27
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,290
This is hopefully going to help explain things.

28
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,010
CaptainSparklez?

29
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,070
He's not CaptainSparklez.

30
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:37,750
I wish, I wish.

31
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:43,970
Oh my god, it's the CaptainSparklez, but British.

32
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:45,930
British CaptainSparklez.

33
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,250
Oh my god.

34
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:51,630
Do you want to do an introduction, Fulham?

35
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:56,390
I mean, dude, I think you guys introduced me well enough.

36
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,390
I can be a British CaptainSparklez if you need me.

37
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:06,950
I think, as far as I know, my aim is to help you guys know what's going on in the game.

38
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:09,890
Yes, so he is our Minecraft analysis.

39
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,270
Analysis expert.

40
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,530
Analysis expert.

41
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:18,610
Because we are here, Min and I are here, to cast a Minecraft tournament.

42
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,070
I guess you couldn't tell.

43
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:25,450
Yeah, I mean, you see CaptainSparklez.

44
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,490
It's not just any kind of Minecraft tournament.

45
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:27,990
No, no, no.

46
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,090
It is a MOBA Minecraft tournament.

47
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,930
Which Min and I have zero knowledge.

48
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,110
We were like, wait.

49
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,030
Today, we were like, wait, this is a MOBA?

50
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:43,710
And Min was like, wait, I thought you knew about MOBAs.

51
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:44,230
And I was like, no, I don't.

52
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:48,670
I didn't say it.

53
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:49,490
I didn't say it.

54
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,510
We still have our one.

55
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:50,870
It's okay.

56
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:51,690
We still got one left.

57
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,950
I didn't say it.

58
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,030
I don't freaking play League.

59
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,910
It's great, because none of us play League.

60
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,770
And none of us play any MOBAs.

61
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:07,210
So we are all going to have to learn as we go.

62
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,550
I played Minecraft, though.

63
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:14,090
Actually, Doki and I, we recently speedrun beating the game.

64
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:14,810
Oh, yeah, beat.

65
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:15,290
On hardcore.

66
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,950
Yeah, we totally beat it.

67
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:21,550
See, this is what I like to hear.

68
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:22,950
That's my whole thing.

69
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,030
That's what I do every day.

70
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,230
I do the whole speedrunning thing.

71
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,250
We did it under 24 hours, too.

72
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:31,230
Dude, that is faster than some people I know.

73
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:31,690
Congratulations.

74
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:35,690
What's your PB?

75
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:36,450
Okay.

76
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,410
10 minutes, 40 seconds.

77
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:42,070
10 minutes, 24 hours.

78
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,330
That's the same thing, man.

79
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:44,510
Yeah, exactly.

80
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,710
We were in hardcore.

81
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:54,090
I think that accounts for minus 50 hours.

82
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:54,710
Exactly.

83
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,350
So I think you guys beat me to be fair.

84
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:59,930
I feel like we are the professionals at this point.

85
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,550
Yeah, I think so.

86
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,090
Yeah.

87
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,810
Yeah, so we're here to cast...

88
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,070
It was actually crazy.

89
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:11,010
They asked me to cast a Minecraft tournament.

90
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:14,410
And they were wondering, Hey, do you know anyone you could bring over?

91
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,850
I was like, I think Mint is a good co-caster.

92
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:21,270
And then Mint actually researched more about this than I did.

93
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,430
I didn't research.

94
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:26,090
They literally sent us documents that you chose not to research.

95
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,730
I got food poisoning yesterday.

96
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,950
I have my excuse.

97
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:31,530
I have my excuse.

98
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:31,930
Oh my god!

99
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:32,950
Food poisoning!

100
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,210
Okay, I think everyone knows I'm in Japan.

101
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:36,670
Everyone knows now.

102
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:40,730
Anyway, the times I've been commuting is very obvious.

103
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:45,830
How do I get food poisoning in Japan?

104
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,150
Like, I don't know.

105
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,250
It's the MOBA part.

106
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,370
MOBA part.

107
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,550
Oh my gosh, look at this map.

108
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:56,330
It's kind of crazy.

109
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,350
This map is pretty cool.

110
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,650
I was told that the maps have names.

111
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:01,850
I'm going to be real with you.

112
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:04,630
I don't remember what they are, so I'm going to find out right now.

113
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:11,690
That is a really imaginative name for a city full of blocks, I think.

114
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,570
I wish I was shitting you, but that's like the real name.

115
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:20,070
Okay,

116
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:23,670
we're back.

117
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,310
Oh, maybe we're not back, actually.

118
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,070
I think I saw a video from their game.

119
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,630
Oh, there's the golden rabbit.

120
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,910
Oh, it's called Block City!

121
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,990
Round 1 is in Block City.

122
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,530
That's what I said!

123
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,010
Oh, I thought you were lying.

124
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:46,090
We're back to CaptainSparklez.

125
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,230
What's the lore?

126
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,830
You said you read the lore?

127
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:52,730
Well, hold on.

128
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:57,390
I believe the first match is TeamSparklez versus TeamHannah.

129
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:02,110
I know all of the people in this event.

130
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,530
Because I'm in the Minecraft scene.

131
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:04,530
I'm in the space.

132
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:08,090
I know the teams, which is kind of cool.

133
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:14,690
Some people know that I'm actually not at my home PC right now.

134
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:19,050
I'm in the house of someone who's playing on CaptainSparklez's team.

135
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,030
CPK.

136
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:23,870
I think he's in TeamSparklez right now.

137
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:26,070
Well, I'll pay you $50 to sabotage.

138
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:27,950
Do you want me to go unplug his internet?

139
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,050
That'd be really good.

140
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:32,070
Go unplug his monitor right now.

141
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,710
Put like some peanut butter on it.

142
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:39,910
Unleash like a rat.

143
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,530
To go and do the dirty work for you.

144
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:48,890
There is one really long cable running through the room that I think is the internet cable.

145
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:51,930
I mean, there's some scissors over there.

146
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,330
They won't know.

147
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,090
There's not like there's evidence right here.

148
00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:01,730
Oh wait, I'm also connected to that internet though, so I would just vanish at the same time.

149
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,530
That would be for a worthy cause.

150
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,050
Imagine the content.

151
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,850
Imagine the drama in the content.

152
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:16,930
People might not know about this Minecraft tournament, but now if you unplug this guy's internet, everybody will know.

153
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:17,630
True.

154
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:18,930
True.

155
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:21,810
But drama creates content.

156
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,490
I learned about that last week.

157
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:25,850
Oh yeah.

158
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,530
Let's save that for another time.

159
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,830
I'm going to read some things from the document.

160
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:39,930
So I'm going to read the objective of the game.

161
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,610
That's helpful to know, I think.

162
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,410
I think the objective is going to be super important.

163
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:45,430
Oh, there's Hannah!

164
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,530
Oh my gosh, they're bowing.

165
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,330
They're bowing to each other.

166
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:48,890
So polite.

167
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:49,770
Good game.

168
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:55,950
Okay, the objective is to eliminate the enemy's dragon.

169
00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:00,450
So basically, each group, each team has their own little ender dragon.

170
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,010
It's actually kind of cute.

171
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:05,490
And it's surrounded by end crystals.

172
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:11,510
So, you know, it's kind of like the ender dragon fight where you have to destroy the crystals before the dragon can be killed.

173
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:14,050
And they also have withers?

174
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:14,970
I don't know what that's about.

175
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:17,230
Oh, so the dragon is like the end point.

176
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:18,690
Like League.

177
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:21,390
The dragon is like the giant crystal in League.

178
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,450
I don't play League, but I've seen it.

179
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:25,930
With your own two eyes?

180
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,590
Yeah, with my own two eyes.

181
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:30,950
I've seen like one or two League games in my life.

182
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,050
Oh, it's the Nexus!

183
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:38,090
Oh my god, one of the moderators are like yelling at me and being like It's the Nexus!

184
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:38,210
It's the Nexus!

185
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:39,790
Yeah!

186
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,930
It's called the Nexus, Doki.

187
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,610
You goddamn nerd.

188
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,210
I'm sorry.

189
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,070
I'm sorry.

190
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,770
Mint didn't know what it was either.

191
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,450
I didn't claim to know.

192
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:56,210
You did.

193
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:59,470
I've seen a League game or two in my day.

194
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,430
Like one or two.

195
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,130
How am I supposed to know the names?

196
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:04,230
I don't know why though.

197
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:04,310
Okay.

198
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:09,050
That's why we are the professional casters for this tournament.

199
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:15,350
Alright, go on with the rules.

200
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,810
There's five rounds.

201
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:22,310
Each round will take place in a different map which is kind of cool.

202
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:37,050
There's like there's different players so each player is gonna start at their house base and then they're gonna pick a character.

203
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,710
Oh, so that's where they're choosing the character.

204
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:45,650
Wait, oh yeah, you were telling me apparently each of these there's like characters with actual lore written about them.

205
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,290
Yeah, it's kind of intricate.

206
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:50,310
Like we have Sir Block.

207
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,450
I need to hear about the granny again, please.

208
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:54,470
Because there's this granny.

209
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:58,450
I want to know someone that's playing as the granny in this game.

210
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,680
We have Granny Gooddrop, age 77.

211
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:07,390
She is recognizably an alien-like slimy yet wholesome grandma character.

212
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:13,830
She plays for the kinship but some people play for the thrill.

213
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:16,690
I was like, hag love.

214
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,210
Hag love, I do.

215
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:26,390
That's the VTuber hive mind going on there.

216
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,750
Finally some good content.

217
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:44,330
But they have like ultimate abilities, so basically there's mobs in the game as well that they can kill to get money and then they can buy like armor or upgrades.

218
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:50,790
Yeah, so it's just basically like farming creep and league and deadlock.

219
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,150
You know so much.

220
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:53,730
You know so much about this.

221
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:56,110
I played deadlock!

222
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:59,930
Okay, I played deadlock which is sort of like league but like shooter.

223
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:03,450
I mean I feel like this game is more like deadlock than league.

224
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:09,350
Actually this is actually a lot more like deadlock than league.

225
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,950
Wow, I never took you as a league player Doki Bird.

226
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,350
No, I didn't like deadlock.

227
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,530
Oh, so you liked league.

228
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,810
She said she didn't like deadlock everybody, she liked league.

229
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,610
No, no, no.

230
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,010
That's what I'm hearing.

231
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:31,630
I've never watched arcane because I'm scared it's going to make me like league.

232
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:39,190
That's the same reason I've not watched it either because I do not want to like league yet.

233
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:43,350
Doki, oh my god you have to watch arcane, it's so good.

234
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,610
And I was like no.

235
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,750
That's a legitimate thing I'd say.

236
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:53,750
I'm afraid that I'll actually like league if I watch arcane and I refuse to give league my time.

237
00:32:54,630 --> 00:33:01,570
All I know is that it takes a really long time to play, like you sit there for 12 hours and then you gain like 3 elo.

238
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:10,970
It's like 40 minutes to 1 hour per game and then if you're losing, the team will hold you hostage.

239
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:21,870
Because you can't quit, you can surrender, but you have to have the whole team wanting to surrender and there's always going to be one asshole that's not going to let you surrender.

240
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:30,450
Like my whole thing is doing things quickly, like I want to speedrun so 10 minutes, great, cool, yeah, awesome.

241
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,570
Like giving me an hour long game?

242
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:34,670
Dude, I can't handle that.

243
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:36,970
Luckily I don't think these games are an hour.

244
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:40,810
That's why this is better because I'm pretty sure we're not going to be held hostage for an hour.

245
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,130
And it's Minecraft!

246
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:45,170
I think they're like 20-30 minutes at most.

247
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:49,090
Wait, how long have you been speedrunning for?

248
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:52,910
This has been my thing for like 4 years, roughly.

249
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,350
Are you on any records?

250
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:00,970
I used to have top 10 worldwide, which was pretty good.

251
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:06,810
I've slowly kind of realized that I don't have the time to put into...

252
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:12,650
Dude, some of these people spend all day doing it and I do not have that capacity in me anymore.

253
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,090
What do you do then?

254
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:17,350
If you're a speedrunner, what do you do if you're not speedrunning?

255
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:19,750
Well, like stream.

256
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:22,570
Some of these people do it offline and stuff, man.

257
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:23,210
Oh!

258
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,730
It's like me when I play rank.

259
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:34,130
I get it, I get it.

260
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,410
I get that, yeah.

261
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,310
You actually have a life outside of streaming, that's crazy.

262
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:44,810
Hey, I don't want to say that I'm at a friend's house right now doing this commentary, but hey, we were at a birthday party.

263
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:47,310
Oh, it was a birthday party?

264
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,630
Shit, sorry.

265
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,250
It's okay, it's okay.

266
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:57,210
It's okay.

267
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,450
We made it 30 minutes.

268
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,770
That's a good amount.

269
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:06,370
I had 30 minutes of it being live.

270
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,670
It's been a week, guys.

271
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,530
I haven't streamed in a week.

272
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:13,430
I have this all built up.

273
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:22,210
Anyway, I was going to say, your friend just got out of a birthday party and now he's here playing Minecraft Tournament?

274
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:24,130
Damn, what a griney.

275
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:27,350
We've gone from a birthday party to do this.

276
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:36,470
I'm commentating in his living room, he's in his studio playing right now, and then as soon as we're done, we're going back out.

277
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:39,650
We're going straight back out to the bar that our friends are at.

278
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:43,190
You're going to another party afterwards?

279
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,130
So the birthday party isn't even over?

280
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:49,050
Wait, you should free game here.

281
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,650
Free game here.

282
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:54,350
You should free game, grab some alcohol and free game right now.

283
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,790
Hey, that's us.

284
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,210
I can't believe it.

285
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:06,770
The party's not even over and your friend is here Dude, both of us have our priorities, right?

286
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:14,710
We have to go and see our friends, we have to say happy birthday man, but I'm going to be so honest with you, in two hours time, I'm leaving and we're going to go play Minecraft.

287
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,450
And then we'll come back, it's okay.

288
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:23,410
Oh my gosh, wait, did you throw a Minecraft themed birthday party?

289
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:23,770
Oh yeah.

290
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,050
Oh dude, I wish.

291
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:27,930
That's literally on branding.

292
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:30,230
It would have been so good.

293
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,650
Minecrafters, you don't even throw a Minecraft party?

294
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:33,410
Like, what's the point?

295
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:38,610
Maybe we'll find the most Minecraft-y thing in his house and just take it.

296
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,010
There's got to be a creeper here somewhere.

297
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:42,130
You could literally just go to Walmart and buy something.

298
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,230
Is there a Walmart in...

299
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:46,590
There is!

300
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:51,770
It's under a different name, yeah, but I mean, it is nearly...

301
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:53,090
It's like 9.30pm.

302
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:55,490
I think we're going to be...

303
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:57,510
I think most of the stores are closed.

304
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:00,470
I'm pretty sure Minecraft stuff is everywhere though.

305
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:03,350
You could literally go to a convenience store and find Minecraft, right?

306
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,170
There's bound to be a Minecraft t-shirt somewhere.

307
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:09,050
Yeah, I'm just going to say, there has to be Minecraft somewhere.

308
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:09,130
And you know what?

309
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:17,270
If your friend wins, the prize money at first place is $25,000 for the whole team.

310
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,070
25k?

311
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:21,910
I think drinks would be on them, probably.

312
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,890
Drinks is 100%.

313
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,410
Oh, we're watching him right now.

314
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:28,370
This is the friend that I'm next to.

315
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,070
Should I run?

316
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,050
Should I run into his room?

317
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:31,430
Go, go, go!

318
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:34,150
Go, go, go!

319
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,430
Show up at his camp, right now!

320
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:41,650
Guys, we have to see if he's lying to us or not.

321
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:44,710
He could be like, I know this guy, and he actually doesn't know.

322
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,230
There he is!

323
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,250
There he is!

324
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,130
Oh my god!

325
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:53,930
Face reveal!

326
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,850
So my chat was like, dox yourself now.

327
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,270
Is this conflict of interest?

328
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:02,650
I did it, I did it.

329
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:04,610
Yeah, we did.

330
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,250
We saw you, we saw you.

331
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,550
Yeah, chat was like, oh my god, face reveal.

332
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,070
Is that a real British Captain Sparkles?

333
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,470
That's me, that's me.

334
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:21,950
My chat was like, is that Captain Sparkles?

335
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:28,890
Why is this guy throwing like, Captain Sparkles is like throwing, he's like, what is he doing?

336
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:29,930
He's got like a little tail.

337
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,910
Oh my god, subscribe for two months.

338
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:33,790
Thanks for the subscription.

339
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:39,550
I think we're gonna be starting the game soon-ish.

340
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:43,270
How many teams are competing, Mint?

341
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,810
That's a great question.

342
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:49,990
Okay, I'll take the answer if you need it.

343
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:53,430
We've got eight teams.

344
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:58,890
We've got eight teams, and we split them off into two groups of four.

345
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:01,790
So those four will play against each other.

346
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,550
There's five on each team though.

347
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:06,890
Five players on each team.

348
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:13,310
We have four groups, sorry, two groups of four teams.

349
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:15,110
And they play against each other once.

350
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,870
And we kind of get like a seeding based on that.

351
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:23,910
So the top teams in the group will go on to like a bracket, and the bottom teams will go on to like a loser's bracket sort of thing.

352
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:28,450
And then we'll find out who comes first, second, third, fourth.

353
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:34,530
What we'll be doing is following the top teams the whole way through pretty much as far as I know.

354
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:40,530
The back-end staff are working hard to bring us the most interesting games as far as I know.

355
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:44,650
I'm sure they're not gonna show us like sixth place versus eighth place, you know what I mean?

356
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:45,830
They're gonna show us first and second.

357
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:48,630
Yeah, we're all the funners.

358
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:54,350
Every team places they get a prize money, so that's nice.

359
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,810
Yeah, it's nice.

360
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:59,350
Like even your last place you get money in the end.

361
00:39:59,790 --> 00:39:59,790
Yeah.

362
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:02,490
And then Minted already got paid, so we're fine.

363
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,490
Hey, we all know why you're here.

364
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:07,950
It's okay.

365
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:11,530
I'm here for the games.

366
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:12,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

367
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,390
We're here also for the games too.

368
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:16,090
Oh, yeah.

369
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:17,990
I'm here to watch the thrill.

370
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:22,830
Actually, I'm curious how MOBA Minecraft is like.

371
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,690
Yeah, me too, honestly.

372
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:29,250
I wanna see how they actually run the whole thing.

373
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,130
I'm glad I don't have to play.

374
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:37,150
It's actually crazy how much you can customize Minecraft in general for random games and stuff.

375
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:37,490
Yeah.

376
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:41,870
Have you ever played anything other than vanilla, Mint?

377
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:42,890
Yeah, I have.

378
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:46,650
Like separate game modes and stuff?

379
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:48,050
Like special game modes?

380
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:52,610
Oh, I played Sonic the Hedgehog.

381
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:53,470
Yeah!

382
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,830
The official Sonic?

383
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:58,470
Yeah, I played the official Sonic.

384
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:04,870
I was like thinking about like Bed Wars or stuff like that.

385
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:05,730
But you're like...

386
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:06,810
What was it called?

387
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:09,310
The Minecraft Civilization?

388
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,350
Oh my gosh, wait!

389
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:14,170
Willem, would you jump for the beef?

390
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:15,690
Oh my god, dude.

391
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:19,990
I would 100% jump for the beef and I would 100% miss and fall.

392
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:21,570
You're a professional!

393
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:24,410
I'm professionally bad.

394
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:25,630
Like...

395
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,950
On stream?

396
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:28,490
It's okay.

397
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:31,790
If I bully myself it means my chat can't bully me.

398
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,050
So, you know.

399
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:35,650
That's not true.

400
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:36,610
No, they definitely can.

401
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,650
That encourages them.

402
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:42,010
Do you hear that chat?

403
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,170
Everybody listen up.

404
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:45,530
If I bully myself, you can't bully me.

405
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:50,670
They're like Oh my god, finally we can let it loose.

406
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,790
They already do.

407
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:53,970
They know who they are.

408
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:54,530
It's fine.

409
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,910
Oh my god, look at the customs!

410
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,440
Rabbit boy!

411
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,420
Did you see her?

412
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,520
She was like the green slimy granny!

413
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,940
I see her!

414
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,100
She's green!

415
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:16,340
Who the heck is the slimy bunny boy?

416
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,800
Hold on, I have the characters pulled up.

417
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:20,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

418
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,020
Um...

419
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,540
Slime hag.

420
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:39,120
Guys, the reason why I'm not looking at it is because I only have one monitor, which is my laptop, so I can't tab.

421
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,540
I can't tab in and out.

422
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,140
Okay, you found it?

423
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,680
Yeah, rabbit person.

424
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,020
Well known for his movement and speed.

425
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:52,000
Okay, the name is Banjax.

426
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,480
I don't know who Banjax is.

427
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,300
Rabbit person would be crazy though, you're right.

428
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,560
So they have like ultimate abilities and stuff like throughout the game and obviously it kind of depends on the person you choose.

429
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:12,140
And the rabbit has rabbit's foot which means they get like quicker like they get speed, which is cool.

430
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:12,700
Oh!

431
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,860
And then their ultimate is bunny hop which lets them like jump really high.

432
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:19,440
The lore?

433
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,040
Okay.

434
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,400
Extremely impulsive and high energy.

435
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:33,020
Banjax is well known for tauntingly leaping around his allies before eagerly leaping into the battlefield, often before his allies are ready.

436
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:33,640
Thanks.

437
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,560
Thank you for that lore.

438
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,940
But what's his age?

439
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,380
27?

440
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:39,360
He's 27?

441
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:48,060
Yeah, like how come like Slime hag gets her age and like profession and everything and then rabbit person is like, he likes to jump.

442
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,440
I'm just a rabbit though, I like jumping.

443
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,280
I'm just a rabbit.

444
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,320
I mean there's Daedra.

445
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:57,360
Daedra is 18 or 1862 years old.

446
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,400
Okay, yeah and what else about him?

447
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,080
I like how someone's like is he single though?

448
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:05,780
Calm down you guys.

449
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,620
That should be in the lore.

450
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,820
Actually, there should be like a relationship taken, it's complicated.

451
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:12,100
It's complicated.

452
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

453
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:18,080
Two of these people are children of like one another.

454
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,660
One of them is the child of one, right?

455
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

456
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,160
Wait, really?

457
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:22,840
Which one?

458
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,780
Angel and Axel.

459
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,060
So Angel is the child of Axel.

460
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:28,500
Are they both angels?

461
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,520
So one of them is a DPS and one of them is a healer.

462
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:34,600
And like the healer is the kid of the DPS.

463
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:35,140
Oh no.

464
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,560
Angel is a minotaur.

465
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:38,820
Oh.

466
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:42,080
Wait, is Angel the child or the...

467
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,180
They're both minotaurs, yeah look.

468
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,000
Less intimidating minotaurs.

469
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:51,020
The less intimidating one is the child, according to the synopsis.

470
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,180
The less intimidating one.

471
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,720
Which one is it?

472
00:44:55,620 --> 00:45:00,980
Okay, but Adria is a cowgirl demon, so I think that is relative.

473
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,920
I think we might be starting.

474
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:05,680
Are we starting?

475
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:06,340
Oh my gosh.

476
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,340
Oh, I see it.

477
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:11,480
One is a white cow, the other one is a brown cow.

478
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,840
Brown cow.

479
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:14,480
Yeah, see look at the left.

480
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,520
No one is playing a slimehag.

481
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,980
Wait, no one is playing slimehag.

482
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:20,700
Is she bad?

483
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,680
There is already a meta.

484
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,220
In MCL.

485
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,040
There is already a meta.

486
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,800
There is already a meta?

487
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,860
This game just started!

488
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,480
They've done this before.

489
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,480
Apparently they've added new characters and so that's the new tournament.

490
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:41,560
Oh, so this is like, I thought it was like they were playing this for the very first time.

491
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,740
But I guess they've trained for it and everything.

492
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:48,800
I think that there's like new maps and new characters but this is a recurring thing, yeah.

493
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:50,420
Look, they're going around, they're killing the mobs, getting their money.

494
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:53,040
Guys, you can play MOBA League right now.

495
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,320
Kill that bat, kill that bat.

496
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,000
Oh, nevermind.

497
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:56,720
Not enough money.

498
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,640
MOBA craft.

499
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,160
I was going to say league is already MOBA.

500
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,660
MOBA craft is good, I like that.

501
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:03,640
MOBA craft is great, yeah.

502
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,280
Wait, that's the nexus!

503
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,480
The dragon.

504
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:07,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

505
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:18,340
So we're seeing these guys click very quickly and that is because we're using a combat system that's well known to be in an older version of Minecraft.

506
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,320
So you guys have played Minecraft recently, right?

507
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:30,120
If you swing at a mob or whatever, you have to like wait between your swings to like charge them back up.

508
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:30,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

509
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:38,080
Back when Minecraft was a little bit in its earlier days, you can just click as much as you want and that's what we're using in this version.

510
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:43,160
So you can see CBK is just spam clicking away and gets the kill there.

511
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,240
Who died?

512
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:48,080
There is a respawn timer.

513
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,460
There is a respawn timer.

514
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,700
But it does, the more they die the higher it gets.

515
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:58,580
So at first it's 10 seconds and then when they respawn it'll be 15 seconds, whatever.

516
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,580
Wait, is CaptainSparklez's team winning then with that first kill?

517
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,680
That first kill might be helpful.

518
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:09,500
I actually don't know how like, how beneficial a kill is really early on because look at the bottom of CaptainSparklez's screen.

519
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,420
We've got like coins and mana, I think?

520
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,060
I think that's mana?

521
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:14,900
I'm not sure.

522
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,040
But then they end up spending these things on these upgrades.

523
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:18,700
Yeah.

524
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,640
Oh my god, there's a piggy bank!

525
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,060
Get your money CaptainSparklez!

526
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,380
Get your money!

527
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:27,360
Come on, go get rich!

528
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,480
Look at him go!

529
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,840
Look at him go, look at him farm the creep.

530
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,260
The best pirate but every MOBA.

531
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,760
I wonder if there's like any secrets and stuff that you can find.

532
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:41,560
Yeah, I wonder I hope so.

533
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,340
Big mobs for big money.

534
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:48,320
You can get inside a building or something and like hit some crazy clip into a wall.

535
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,260
That's what I'd be looking for right now.

536
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:56,480
So right now we're out exploring the map instead of actually doing the objective.

537
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,440
That's crazy.

538
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,640
What are you doing?

539
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:01,760
Oh, they're fighting!

540
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:03,920
Bro, he was just dodging.

541
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:05,560
Oh no, it's one against two.

542
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,340
He was not gonna win that.

543
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:08,920
He got cornered.

544
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,120
That's one to one.

545
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,360
Looks like one kill each, right?

546
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,000
Oh, but there is another death on the other team.

547
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,060
Maybe we missed the death there.

548
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,180
I think it might be...

549
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:20,500
I mean, it's very early on in the game.

550
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,520
I don't wanna make any predictions here.

551
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:25,920
Oh, I was gonna be like, oh, there's still three minutes left of the game.

552
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:26,980
I was like, that's a short game.

553
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,100
I realized I was counting up.

554
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:31,520
Yeah, I was gonna be like, there's three minutes left?

555
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:32,200
That's crazy.

556
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:38,500
Are all these games going on simultaneously or is it like...

557
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,100
Yeah, exactly.

558
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:45,940
So we have like four games running at the same time and right now we're gonna watch one.

559
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:53,860
I think it's definitely in my opinion, probably two of the best teams out of the group facing off against each other.

560
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:54,740
Wait, really?

561
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:57,220
Which team has Feinberg?

562
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,040
How do we know Feinberg?

563
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:01,340
Hello?

564
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,280
Because I saw you was in the game.

565
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,040
How do you guys know Feinberg?

566
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:18,660
Well, I know Feinberg because I had him on my team before and everybody was like, Feinberg has one of the top, the most records for any Minecraft tournament.

567
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:24,900
He's a good friend of mine and I love that everyone knows him.

568
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,460
He is a really, really lovely guy.

569
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:27,400
Is he that good of a friend?

570
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:28,240
Would he lend you $100?

571
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:30,120
Yeah, would he lend you $100?

572
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:39,560
If you were dangling from the cliff and then like he had to he was in the middle of completing a number one Minecraft record, would he let you die or save you?

573
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:46,340
If he completes the record, he'll be like number one in the world or he saves you.

574
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:52,620
Okay, I'm gonna say I think he might save me because he's already number one.

575
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:53,980
Just saying.

576
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:56,900
But there's definitely a might.

577
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,360
There's definitely like a 50-50 there.

578
00:49:58,460 --> 00:49:59,140
I have to get lucky.

579
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:03,060
It's not even like 80 or 90.

580
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,400
Oh no, no, no.

581
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,400
Definitely 50-50.

582
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:10,060
It really depends because if everything's going right and that's the one he's not looking away.

583
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:13,780
He's not looking away.

584
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,160
Even with you like screaming at him.

585
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:17,480
100%.

586
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,240
He's totally locked in if that's the case.

587
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,620
Oh, they backed off for now.

588
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,420
How long do these games usually last for?

589
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,540
Now that is a question I won't be able to tell you.

590
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:34,360
I think it's probably around 20 minutes, maybe 25 minutes.

591
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,000
You know, that's like half of a league game.

592
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:38,400
That's already better than leagues.

593
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,120
He probably gets a kill there.

594
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,480
So it does say...

595
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,400
Oh, but then dies in the retake.

596
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:47,780
Yeah, I mean like he was already low.

597
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:49,480
Oh, the Minecraft music.

598
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,400
Oh, the Minecraft music popped in.

599
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,220
That scared me.

600
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,020
We're so chill.

601
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,500
It becomes so much more relaxed.

602
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:57,600
Even though we see all these people fighting.

603
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,220
They're all like dying to each other.

604
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,200
But look at this Minecraft music.

605
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:05,300
It's almost like piano jump scare.

606
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,840
Now, something that's really interesting.

607
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:14,960
I think like CaptainSparklez right now isn't spending his cash, right?

608
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,220
He's got 350 bucks just sitting there.

609
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:21,420
And I think you can spend those on upgrades for like the team.

610
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,580
Is this like a...

611
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:26,720
Oh, is this like the mid boss?

612
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,300
It might well be.

613
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,260
It looks like it's towards the middle of the map.

614
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,560
I guess this is going to give one team a huge advantage.

615
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,660
It looks like Red is taking it out.

616
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:35,300
It's right smack dab in the middle.

617
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:38,460
I wonder if the mid boss regens.

618
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:43,760
Cause I know in Deadlock, the mid boss regens if you don't hit it again.

619
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,140
Oh dude, look at the...

620
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:47,340
It's got a different texture in the game.

621
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:49,320
Oh no!

622
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:53,740
Yeah, wait, why does that team have a different texture for their side?

623
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:56,560
It shows up as a slime, but it shows up as a pot of gold for the other people.

624
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:59,840
Yeah, I was going to be like, that's weird.

625
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:00,680
It's a mimic.

626
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:04,860
I guess it's just like the different themes, it looks different.

627
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:06,080
Maybe so.

628
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,360
I mean, oh my god, they're so close.

629
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,920
Wait, the Nexus is so close.

630
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,540
The Ender Dragon is so close to them.

631
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:12,100
Yeah.

632
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:14,280
I didn't realize it was that close.

633
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:15,760
Look out below!

634
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,580
It's right in the middle.

635
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,740
Look out below!

636
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:21,840
Oh!

637
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:22,820
Baby!

638
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:25,980
Oh wow!

639
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:28,120
And it's dead!

640
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:36,260
It looks like team Red was able to kill that, so I think that CaptainSparklez team was able to get whatever bonus you get.

641
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:39,000
I assume that's some coins or some mana.

642
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,780
It should be money because it's pot of gold.

643
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:42,740
Look out below!

644
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,240
I was like, what the heck was that?

645
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,660
What's going on here when they go into the wall?

646
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,800
I think they were just healing.

647
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,120
They might be trying to hide and heal there.

648
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,060
It looks like maybe that's a sudden death timer right underneath.

649
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:00,200
That's counting down here.

650
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,280
Sudden death?

651
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,540
Oh my god.

652
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:05,760
Dates are high!

653
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:09,520
The 20 minutes was probably a pretty good guess.

654
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,400
I think it's around about 20 minutes estimated.

655
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:17,540
So I guess if they don't win the game within 20 minutes, it's like you just have one life left.

656
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,780
It does say that the matches have a 40 minute timer.

657
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:27,620
Well, we are a tiny bit behind schedule, so maybe there's like a...

658
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:29,460
Maybe they're just like, nope, nevermind.

659
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,040
Someone's like...

660
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,980
It could be the slime respawn timer.

661
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:38,940
Someone said that.

662
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:39,860
Oh, possibly.

663
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,240
But it looks like a little skull.

664
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:44,220
That's true.

665
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:45,560
I mean, it does look...

666
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:46,800
Oh, we'll see in 9 minutes.

667
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:47,840
Looks more ominous.

668
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:50,880
We'll see in 9 minutes what it really is.

669
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:52,800
Someone go straight to the dragon.

670
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:53,880
No one's protecting it.

671
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:57,200
What if they just flank and just go straight there?

672
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,480
I'm sure these guys are screaming at each other in coal.

673
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:05,680
Going like, we need to go left!

674
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,520
We need to go right!

675
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:07,380
We need to do this!

676
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:12,480
Each dragon does have the withers protecting it too though.

677
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:13,420
That's true.

678
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:15,700
One person I think would be kind of...

679
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:16,600
We'll die.

680
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,040
That guy's so low.

681
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,500
His HP is so low right now.

682
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,000
Heal!

683
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:22,460
Heal!

684
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,040
Heal!

685
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,020
Oh, you can recall and go straight home.

686
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,200
That's smart.

687
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,460
So you can go back and...

688
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:32,600
Yeah, so you can go back and buy items and heal and stuff.

689
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:33,180
Interesting.

690
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,880
And you can always protect yourself as well and just get out of situations.

691
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:39,900
I hope we get to watch someone play slime hag.

692
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:43,740
I just want to see slime hag.

693
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,220
Justice for slime hag.

694
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:46,580
Justice for slime hag.

695
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:47,700
Make her a meta!

696
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,140
Make her a meta again!

697
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:51,460
Again?

698
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:52,840
As if she were before.

699
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,920
Looks like Shatter is close to the red base here and he's getting a few kills.

700
00:54:59,020 --> 00:54:59,880
He's got two kills here.

701
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:00,780
Nice.

702
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,620
That was a good advancement.

703
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,920
I think that's like the first damage we've seen on any of the withers on the outside.

704
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,700
Wait, they shot the wither?

705
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:13,760
She was so far.

706
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:19,560
I think it might have literally been one hit, so I don't think it matters that much, but...

707
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,600
It's more than the other team have done so far.

708
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:24,400
The one hit wonder.

709
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:28,940
As long as the other team never touches the wither, they win.

710
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,340
It's just that easy.

711
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:32,620
Yeah, pretty much.

712
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:39,900
Oh my god, it's a giant team fight right now.

713
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:41,420
What the heck was that?

714
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:43,020
Was that an ultimate line again?

715
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,120
It looks like an ultimate.

716
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,700
Oh my gosh, look at the iron golem.

717
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,280
Oh my god, look at them all advance.

718
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,520
There's four of the red team.

719
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,520
Four of the red team are pushing in right now.

720
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,220
Oh my god, they're going in.

721
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,500
The withers are fighting back.

722
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:02,840
So much of ASMR jumpscares.

723
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:03,920
I know.

724
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:10,210
I want to play right now.

725
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,660
Wait, maybe that's the mom.

726
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,620
Wasn't there like a mom character here?

727
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:21,320
Or a child?

728
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,640
That was blue's team, right?

729
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:24,500
That went in.

730
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,100
Red went in, but blue just defended their base.

731
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,260
You can see at the top, they've got health bars.

732
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,840
And the wither for blue is already at half health.

733
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:39,760
So if red go back in, that could be a big exploit for red team.

734
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:43,300
But the blue team did get a little bit of damage on the red wither as well.

735
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:46,180
And blue don't have to respawn now.

736
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,540
Because it looks like red are on the defense.

737
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:51,800
Thank god for our Minecraft analysis, guys.

738
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:52,240
I know.

739
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:58,260
I would have definitely not registered on any of that.

740
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,360
I like the just pit a fire that you can spawn in there.

741
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:06,780
Good shot.

742
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,580
That was such a good shot.

743
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:10,100
That was, yeah.

744
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:12,240
What a shot from that guy.

745
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,780
Whoever that guy was.

746
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:26,080
Oh my god, wait.

747
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,780
They're doing big damage on that wither.

748
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:29,080
Yeah, that one wither.

749
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,080
That one is low now.

750
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:35,240
Oh yeah, they have to retreat because all of them are coming back now.

751
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,600
This Minecraft music makes it so much more dramatic.

752
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:40,620
Yeah.

753
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:44,060
What even are those blocks?

754
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,360
Those red blocks.

755
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:50,860
Those are spawned so they're spawning little mobs that they can attack for money and stuff.

756
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,520
I'm learning, see?

757
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:54,900
I'm learning as we go.

758
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,920
I think if we were in this, I think we'd be winning.

759
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:58,460
Just saying.

760
00:57:58,840 --> 00:57:59,680
I think so too.

761
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:00,240
100%.

762
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,160
I think so too.

763
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:07,720
As long as they give us plus 500% HP and plus 100% damage.

764
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:09,140
I would definitely win this.

765
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,820
I need the wither skull effect.

766
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:16,960
If I tap them once, they lose all their hearts.

767
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,560
Just make us giant ender dragons too and we can fly.

768
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,240
The caster buff right there.

769
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:26,620
Give me a car.

770
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:30,480
Give me a car and run people over.

771
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,780
That should be the final match.

772
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:39,280
The final team has to defeat the casters to win my game.

773
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:43,860
Whoa, the voice said red tower under attack.

774
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,560
Oh my god, the red tower's HP is gone.

775
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,460
The first one's down.

776
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,700
We can't see it.

777
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:51,940
Please show us the base.

778
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,800
Oh okay, red was able to defend it.

779
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,460
But the wither was the worst.

780
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:02,460
The wither's down, so they're down to the crystal now.

781
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:05,100
They still have two more withers.

782
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,140
Everybody has three.

783
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:11,340
Do you have to kill all of the withers before you can go to the crystal?

784
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,140
I believe so.

785
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:16,100
I guess the crystals are closest to the wither.

786
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,560
If you're trying to get for the other crystal.

787
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:22,120
I assume each wither is guiding their own crystal.

788
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,600
Oh my god, there's one guy.

789
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,700
He's like, let me solo her.

790
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,080
Oh my god, he's almost got the wither.

791
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:33,760
He's got it, right?

792
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:34,660
He's got it.

793
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:38,480
Where's his team?

794
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:39,260
Where's the team?

795
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:41,660
They just let him solo it.

796
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,560
His team are all dead, it looks like.

797
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:49,760
Red really pushed up on the blue crystals, but he was just left on his own.

798
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:51,860
He was able to solo out a whole wither.

799
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:53,460
Shasta's done really well.

800
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:59,820
Shasta's well known to be a really strong PvPer, so...

801
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:02,240
But, he's able to be taken down by two.

802
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,040
That helps.

803
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:05,740
No matter how good you are, 1v2.

804
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,460
1v1 him, that's not fair.

805
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,560
Where is the integrity here?

806
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:14,720
He had performance anxiety.

807
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,720
He knew he was on the screen.

808
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,140
They're like, they got one guy.

809
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:19,020
Yeah, they did.

810
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,400
They got one guy.

811
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:25,820
All of team blue have their ults, pretty much.

812
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:26,880
They might win, then.

813
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,560
They might have all fully charged, pretty much.

814
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:30,780
Yeah, and they...

815
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:32,740
Oh, they're trying to go back in.

816
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:39,040
I think if they did like a charged attack...

817
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:39,420
Oh!

818
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,060
Oh!

819
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:44,040
Oh my god!

820
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:45,840
Who gets the kill?

821
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,460
I think it's one more wither.

822
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:51,800
It's just one more wither, and just push it.

823
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:53,940
Just sneak in, like that other guy.

824
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:58,160
I feel like I'm gonna have to heavy defend now, though.

825
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:01,320
Because they're so behind of everything.

826
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,180
Dude, he's pushing again.

827
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:07,160
Shatter's the only one at the base, and he's able to get more damage, look!

828
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:08,720
He's the only one here.

829
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:10,640
Okay, now he's being defended.

830
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,060
These guys gotta watch out.

831
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:16,300
He's got like one third, not one third, but he's got a little bit of it.

832
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,740
Oh my god, they let him live?

833
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:19,800
He just runs away?

834
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,640
Are you just gonna let him run away?

835
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:30,020
I like how people are like, why is Mint blue in color instead of mint?

836
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:32,560
This is her, when she plays Minecraft, she turns blue.

837
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,120
This is me locked in.

838
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:34,920
Yeah.

839
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:39,840
Yeah, what, it's like, what flavor of mint are you right now?

840
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:42,380
I'm, uh...

841
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:44,140
Winter, no.

842
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:46,500
Winter Breeze!

843
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:53,540
Spearmint?

844
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:54,600
No, that's too green.

845
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:57,040
Blueberry.

846
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,020
Wait, they already got the crystal!

847
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,360
Look at all of the blue teams!

848
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:05,860
Look at blue team's health as well!

849
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,400
Wait, no, I think that's final death.

850
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,780
I think that's like the final...

851
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:14,500
When it gets like close to the end time...

852
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:17,020
Maybe, maybe they're all taking more and more damage.

853
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:17,520
Maybe.

854
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,020
Yeah, they lowered the health.

855
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,800
I'm gonna go shop real quick.

856
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:22,640
Yeah, right?

857
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,760
In the middle of a fight?

858
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:26,360
Quick intermission.

859
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:30,280
Wait, that's...

860
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,720
Oh my god, wait, they're gonna blue...

861
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:35,140
Red team's gonna win because of the the timer.

862
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,580
This is alive though.

863
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:49,580
Yeah, but like because of, because like uh, the timer going down all the crystals and wither took damage, so like red has like an advantage there.

864
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:52,060
Oh, the pot of gold is back again.

865
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,600
Yeah, if you don't get it done in time.

866
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:58,120
Yeah.

867
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:03,360
Blue team worked so hard lowering red like, actually no, not blue team.

868
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:05,440
That one guy worked so hard.

869
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:06,660
That's true, that's true.

870
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,420
There's a monkey in the tree!

871
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:11,360
Get him out of the tree!

872
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:13,520
Red tower is under attack.

873
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:14,220
No!

874
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:15,940
Not the monkey!

875
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:17,880
What's he doing?

876
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,480
Where's his family?

877
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:21,580
Help him.

878
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:24,480
Red tower is gone.

879
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,500
There's only two crystals left for red.

880
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:29,180
And they're really low, I think.

881
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:32,240
Red crystal dead.

882
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,020
There's only one left.

883
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:34,740
And the dragon!

884
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:41,200
Blue are gonna take the win here, and we're not gonna be able to see it, but it's just one guy.

885
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,280
One guy!

886
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:43,440
It's just one guy!

887
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:47,000
It's just one guy!

888
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:48,580
They defended it just!

889
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:51,600
Just one guy!

890
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,390
There's only one guy!

891
01:03:56,270 --> 01:03:58,810
Their main tower is on like 30% health.

892
01:03:59,010 --> 01:03:59,550
This is...

893
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:03,270
Red team needs something crazy here for this to be able to have a comeback.

894
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:05,170
They literally just have to send one guy over it.

895
01:04:09,790 --> 01:04:13,690
Blue member is down too, so it's like...

896
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:14,430
Oh, that's true!

897
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:16,990
There it is!

898
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:20,810
One guy!

899
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:24,170
Anna's team takes the win!

900
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:28,030
Being honest, it pretty much was a one man mission there for Shata.

901
01:04:28,210 --> 01:04:30,790
He was able to take out so many towers and crystals.

902
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:35,230
He actually took down the dragon himself too.

903
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:36,290
MVP.

904
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:38,610
MVP, one guy.

905
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:39,890
One guy.

906
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:44,230
Crazy.

907
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:54,530
The fact that almost like three people from Kat and Sparkle's team had to defend themselves against that guy.

908
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:55,750
That's crazy to see.

909
01:04:57,330 --> 01:05:02,850
I know that he's a super strong player, but I'm surprised he was able to do that much.

910
01:05:04,490 --> 01:05:06,050
Red's no slouch team here.

911
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:08,290
I'm not expecting them to get completely whooped.

912
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:10,230
What's up, Red?

913
01:05:10,310 --> 01:05:12,030
The middle pot of gold, right?

914
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:16,550
Yeah, Red team won the pot of gold and everything.

915
01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:18,670
Wait, who was the one guy?

916
01:05:18,810 --> 01:05:19,350
Was it Shata?

917
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:21,710
Was it Rabbit Boy?

918
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:24,630
It's Rabbit Boy!

919
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:26,570
He was so fast.

920
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:27,450
Maybe it is.

921
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:30,270
Look, he's able to jump around really quick.

922
01:05:32,070 --> 01:05:35,170
Whoa, look down below!

923
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:41,630
Oh my god, there he is.

924
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:42,710
There's their team.

925
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:44,110
There they go.

926
01:05:45,390 --> 01:05:50,350
I honestly thought Red could make a really good comeback, especially when they got all of that damage from the timing.

927
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:53,690
At one point, it was really any person's game, but...

928
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:55,430
They started with the damage, too.

929
01:05:55,530 --> 01:05:56,550
They started really well.

930
01:05:56,570 --> 01:06:01,490
Yeah, they got the first one, but literally Shata was able to take out like a whole crystal on his own.

931
01:06:01,610 --> 01:06:03,270
It's like, I don't know how.

932
01:06:03,290 --> 01:06:05,530
No, he took down like two withers and a crystal.

933
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:07,510
And I think the dragon, too.

934
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:09,130
For real, right?

935
01:06:09,230 --> 01:06:10,630
It was just one person on the dragon.

936
01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:15,350
Yeah, I was like, took down the majority of the dragon.

937
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:16,850
And they let him live.

938
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:17,870
I was so surprised.

939
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:20,110
I was like, he just ran away.

940
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:21,390
I was like, whoa, okay.

941
01:06:23,690 --> 01:06:25,310
These replays are really sick, actually.

942
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:28,810
I'm so glad that we're able to see these back really quickly.

943
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:30,070
I know that's difficult.

944
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:30,890
Oh, there he is.

945
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:31,810
They killed him.

946
01:06:32,270 --> 01:06:33,070
There he is, bang.

947
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:34,590
He gets to take it out.

948
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:37,130
He literally killed him before his final breath.

949
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:38,010
Did you see that?

950
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:40,630
He killed the dragon before he died.

951
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:42,610
Oh my god.

952
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:44,590
What a hero.

953
01:06:44,930 --> 01:06:45,470
What a hero.

954
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:49,970
That was crazy.

955
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:51,590
That was a crazy first game to watch.

956
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:54,250
Oh, they changed a little.

957
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:57,870
Oh, I think we still have one match going.

958
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:04,010
Which is team 5up and team btmc.

959
01:07:04,610 --> 01:07:06,210
So we're just waiting on their match.

960
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:09,250
We're waiting on the final teams before we can watch the next.

961
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:11,830
Next game is like Waste of Horses.

962
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:12,570
Is that what it's called?

963
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:14,970
Dude, I'm not trying to pronounce that.

964
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:17,290
You guys try it.

965
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:21,870
How is there an H and an R next to each other?

966
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:23,430
How does that even sound?

967
01:07:25,990 --> 01:07:29,270
Like Hoth from Star Wars with an R.

968
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:31,430
Oh, like Hoth from Star Wars.

969
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:34,370
Like Hoth from Star Wars Harf.

970
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:35,370
Harf.

971
01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:41,550
How about we just call it Waste?

972
01:07:42,290 --> 01:07:43,730
That's a better idea, right?

973
01:07:44,210 --> 01:07:44,650
The Waste.

974
01:07:45,030 --> 01:07:46,070
The Waste.

975
01:07:50,390 --> 01:07:52,750
So we got team Hannah winning.

976
01:07:52,910 --> 01:07:53,710
Well, we saw that one.

977
01:07:53,790 --> 01:07:59,310
We had team Smajor win round 1 and team Smallant win...

978
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:01,170
Oh, Smallant!

979
01:08:01,470 --> 01:08:02,430
I didn't watch him too!

980
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:04,430
I was gonna say, you guys might know Smallant.

981
01:08:04,850 --> 01:08:09,830
Smallant's the team with Feinberg, so you guys got there.

982
01:08:10,830 --> 01:08:11,690
Yeah, I do!

983
01:08:11,950 --> 01:08:13,390
Actually, all the time.

984
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:18,650
Well, we know which team Mint's gonna cheer for.

985
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:19,070
Right?

986
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:21,910
Hey, it's the one with Feinberg on as well.

987
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:23,410
So that's the one you're cheering for too.

988
01:08:23,410 --> 01:08:25,210
Oh, it's the Feinberg team!

989
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:33,070
Next round, we have team Snifferish vs.

990
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:35,730
team Hannah team Sparkles vs.

991
01:08:35,930 --> 01:08:38,750
team Smajor team Smallant vs.

992
01:08:39,010 --> 01:08:42,070
team BTMC and team FiveUp vs.

993
01:08:42,210 --> 01:08:43,690
team Shubble.

994
01:08:44,130 --> 01:08:45,810
Can we request which team we wanna watch?

995
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:47,290
Let's just watch team Smallant.

996
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:48,510
Yeah, can we please?

997
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:50,270
Can we watch Smallant?

998
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:55,730
Look, I think they're gonna make it to the final, so I think we will definitely see him at least once.

999
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:58,670
Yeah, it's gonna be such a good game.

1000
01:08:58,830 --> 01:08:59,970
I have like...

1001
01:08:59,970 --> 01:09:02,350
When I spectate someone though, they end up losing.

1002
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:03,350
So I don't know.

1003
01:09:03,730 --> 01:09:05,770
Then we definitely should spectate Smallant.

1004
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:06,330
You're a jinx?

1005
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:08,790
Yeah, I'm a bit of a jinx.

1006
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:11,470
Alright, let's do it.

1007
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:13,670
I'm doing the...

1008
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:15,870
I'm doing my job of doing the analysis thing.

1009
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:16,370
Right?

1010
01:09:17,050 --> 01:09:23,510
So all of the other teams that played each other, the team that got more kills usually took out the dragon and won the game.

1011
01:09:23,810 --> 01:09:29,990
But in the game that we watched, the red team got more kills but then lost to the blue team.

1012
01:09:30,490 --> 01:09:31,770
So it was like... I don't know.

1013
01:09:31,830 --> 01:09:38,450
Maybe it was like a strategy difference that maybe team red were just trying to kill too much and then wasn't focusing on the towers.

1014
01:09:41,530 --> 01:09:42,590
True, yeah, you're right.

1015
01:09:43,370 --> 01:09:46,850
So maybe they more strategically used them to their advantage.

1016
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:51,370
I think team red just might have got more kills but they just don't look for flankers.

1017
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:57,430
Because literally they got that one guy sneaked in like three or four different times.

1018
01:09:57,610 --> 01:10:03,870
And you would think that after the second time they learned from it but then he just kept doing it.

1019
01:10:05,950 --> 01:10:07,890
Dude, they gotta have one guy on defense.

1020
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:10,330
You need one person to stay back.

1021
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:11,910
No, no, just maybe two.

1022
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:13,450
Maybe two, right?

1023
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:18,450
I think they had one guy on defense and then he dies to the other guy.

1024
01:10:18,530 --> 01:10:21,010
Right, they lose the 1v1 and then it's like uh-oh.

1025
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:24,870
Yeah, they lost the 1v1 and then they're like, whoops, okay, well that's my bad.

1026
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:28,890
Yeah, it just kept happening.

1027
01:10:29,170 --> 01:10:29,910
Several times.

1028
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:31,710
I think that's the reason why they lost.

1029
01:10:32,150 --> 01:10:33,650
Match four, how's their winner?

1030
01:10:33,910 --> 01:10:36,070
It was... the winner was team five up.

1031
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:41,390
How many matches are there in total again?

1032
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:47,290
There's four matches going on at a time and there's five rounds.

1033
01:10:47,970 --> 01:10:51,070
So guys, there's still three more... wait, does that include the finals?

1034
01:10:52,690 --> 01:10:54,030
So yeah, there's four more to go, right?

1035
01:10:54,070 --> 01:10:55,570
We gotta watch four more, I think.

1036
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:59,530
Yeah, but does that include the finals or is it the rounds for qualifying?

1037
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:06,650
We got three group stage matches and then two, like a semi-final and a final.

1038
01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:10,170
So there's two more group stages and then two semis and then finals.

1039
01:11:11,070 --> 01:11:13,070
Just for the people in chat...

1040
01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:14,030
I totally knew that.

1041
01:11:15,110 --> 01:11:16,690
You were testing me.

1042
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:20,730
I just want to ask these questions for chat.

1043
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:23,430
I'm pretty sure they were curious about it too.

1044
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:29,350
I just think Fulham is more articulate with how you can say the answers.

1045
01:11:30,350 --> 01:11:31,090
It's like a test.

1046
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:31,670
We're testing him.

1047
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:35,930
I'm here to be chat's representative.

1048
01:11:36,210 --> 01:11:37,990
I'm role-playing as chat, you know.

1049
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:41,290
I'm asking the questions that they want to ask.

1050
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:42,450
You're welcome, chat.

1051
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:43,910
Do you have any questions?

1052
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:46,690
I'll ask them for you guys.

1053
01:11:46,690 --> 01:11:48,170
They're asking, why is Mint blue?

1054
01:11:49,230 --> 01:11:51,670
I told you, she's Winter Breeze Mint.

1055
01:11:54,070 --> 01:11:55,650
I'm Arctic Mint.

1056
01:11:57,030 --> 01:11:58,590
It's like Arctic Foxes.

1057
01:11:58,870 --> 01:12:01,450
During the winter, they change color.

1058
01:12:02,570 --> 01:12:05,870
They change color to white, but instead you change to blue.

1059
01:12:06,550 --> 01:12:07,990
I'm just a little...

1060
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:10,530
I'm a little shrunk today.

1061
01:12:16,190 --> 01:12:20,110
We're just waiting for the next game right now.

1062
01:12:20,590 --> 01:12:25,590
After that, we're going to be gaming again.

1063
01:12:25,630 --> 01:12:29,330
We're going to watch Small Ants.

1064
01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:31,450
Who's Small Ant playing against?

1065
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:32,770
BTMC, right?

1066
01:12:32,770 --> 01:12:34,670
Yes, BTMC.

1067
01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:37,870
There they are!

1068
01:12:38,330 --> 01:12:38,970
That's your favorite!

1069
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:41,370
That's my Oshie!

1070
01:12:42,290 --> 01:12:44,270
That's your Minecraft Oshie!

1071
01:12:44,350 --> 01:12:45,770
That's my Minecraft Oshie!

1072
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:51,150
Dude,

1073
01:12:57,730 --> 01:13:00,970
I have too much insight about most of the people on this team.

1074
01:13:00,970 --> 01:13:07,110
I am like very good friends with four fifths of these people.

1075
01:13:07,570 --> 01:13:09,610
Moony is the only person I don't know.

1076
01:13:10,210 --> 01:13:13,350
I think Moony's a VTuber as well.

1077
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:16,730
I'm not in the scene hugely.

1078
01:13:17,170 --> 01:13:20,350
I have played Minecraft once with Moony though, and she was very cool.

1079
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:24,550
So, we have Feinberg, who's like the guy, right?

1080
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:27,970
The one guy that's really quick and really fast and cool.

1081
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:28,890
He has the most records.

1082
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:41,290
But, if I tell you that Silva, the guy with the dog as the profile picture, when I tell you he's better than Feinberg is...

1083
01:13:41,290 --> 01:13:43,630
Is that a hot take?

1084
01:13:43,930 --> 01:13:44,970
Is that a hot take?

1085
01:13:45,210 --> 01:13:47,190
Is that a hot take right now?

1086
01:13:47,290 --> 01:13:49,410
Maybe I'm getting cancelled on Twitter right now.

1087
01:13:49,910 --> 01:13:51,610
Will people blame you for saying that?

1088
01:13:53,150 --> 01:13:53,710
Drama!

1089
01:13:54,010 --> 01:13:57,930
I'm gonna get called out like, I prefer this friend to this friend.

1090
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:05,580
I think Silva's a bit of a hidden gem.

1091
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:06,240
You know what I mean?

1092
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:10,400
I think Silva's a little bit of a... He's underground right now.

1093
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,960
He's an up-and-comer.

1094
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:14,040
Exactly.

1095
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:17,240
Look at this map.

1096
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:21,620
He's just starting to get more and more records, right?

1097
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:22,660
Oh dude, yeah.

1098
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:25,940
He's quicker than Feinberg is.

1099
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:30,020
I'm telling you that as a factor right now.

1100
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:36,120
The opinions stated here do not reflect all of the co-cast.

1101
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:37,060
True, true.

1102
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:42,600
Minecraft fans, chill.

1103
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,980
We don't know much about the community.

1104
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:45,640
Just blame me.

1105
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:46,100
It's okay.

1106
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:46,680
It's okay.

1107
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:47,940
You can keep blaming me.

1108
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:54,360
So it looks like there's some spawns down inside the crevice.

1109
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:55,280
This is so cool.

1110
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:58,180
It's like a two-tiered map.

1111
01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:01,140
You've got the top level which has the three lanes.

1112
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:05,980
I mean, it's more open.

1113
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:10,820
You're gonna struggle to get one man like the other team did.

1114
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:15,040
There's no secret path through a building or whatever like before.

1115
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:18,780
Jump!

1116
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:21,020
Jump!

1117
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:22,900
Do they take damage if they fall?

1118
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:23,540
No!

1119
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:24,980
Oh my god, they're fine.

1120
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:28,840
See, there is a bottom pathway.

1121
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,160
They can get one guy.

1122
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:33,100
There's literally one guy at the bottom right now.

1123
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:33,380
There is.

1124
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:36,280
There's one red team that's just like running from the bottom.

1125
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:42,560
Oh, that must be the pot of gold.

1126
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:43,660
That giant face thing.

1127
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:44,740
No, it's gum gum.

1128
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:45,980
Why is it called gum gum?

1129
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:47,680
What does that mean?

1130
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:49,560
Oh my god, it's gum gum.

1131
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:50,900
It's gum gum, obviously.

1132
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:52,180
Oh, my fault.

1133
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:52,800
My fault.

1134
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:53,320
Of course.

1135
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:54,560
Sorry, sorry.

1136
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:55,320
I should know.

1137
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:56,420
It's gum gum?

1138
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:57,620
Sorry, sorry.

1139
01:15:58,020 --> 01:15:59,020
I completely forgot.

1140
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:03,020
Duh, of course.

1141
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,200
It's gum gum.

1142
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:08,740
First name gum, second name gum.

1143
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:15,560
We were told by staff that it's gum gum pistol but I don't think that explains anything.

1144
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:18,240
Is it really?

1145
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:20,920
That's One Piece, isn't that?

1146
01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:23,980
Oh, I'm thinking One Piece.

1147
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:35,730
Yeah, I was gonna say man, oh my god, how Otaku and you don't know anything about One Piece.

1148
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:38,570
I know the One Piece.

1149
01:16:41,670 --> 01:16:43,090
I can't believe it.

1150
01:16:43,150 --> 01:16:46,570
You're more of an anime fan than me and you didn't know about gum gum pistol?

1151
01:16:47,410 --> 01:16:50,430
No, well, um, take my card.

1152
01:16:50,510 --> 01:16:50,970
Here you go.

1153
01:16:51,110 --> 01:16:52,490
Here's my Otaku card.

1154
01:16:52,830 --> 01:16:53,970
It's yours now.

1155
01:16:55,570 --> 01:16:56,730
You can have it.

1156
01:16:56,850 --> 01:16:57,450
I don't care.

1157
01:16:57,610 --> 01:16:57,850
Whatever.

1158
01:16:58,830 --> 01:17:00,630
She doesn't care about you guys, chat.

1159
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:03,250
How is that even real?

1160
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:05,950
She hates you.

1161
01:17:06,070 --> 01:17:07,270
She doesn't care about the Otakus.

1162
01:17:07,270 --> 01:17:09,470
One Piece is just not moe enough for me.

1163
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:11,690
She doesn't care about anime anymore.

1164
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:14,810
I used to be an Otaku.

1165
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:20,310
Blue Mint is so mean.

1166
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:27,450
The more blue she becomes, the more normie she is.

1167
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:28,830
That's a scary thought.

1168
01:17:31,410 --> 01:17:33,450
Aw, the little axolotls are so cute.

1169
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:38,570
Oh my god, wait, they gotta kill it for creep!

1170
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:39,510
That's a creep!

1171
01:17:40,050 --> 01:17:42,810
How many people have fallen into the...

1172
01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:43,410
The hole?

1173
01:17:44,510 --> 01:17:46,770
Dude, I don't know how they get back up.

1174
01:17:46,770 --> 01:17:48,630
Like, where's the...

1175
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:50,670
Where's the path back to the top?

1176
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:52,610
There's a staircase on each side.

1177
01:17:53,050 --> 01:17:53,850
Oh, okay, okay.

1178
01:17:53,910 --> 01:17:55,570
So there is a way to get out from the bottom.

1179
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:58,370
Okay, I've just said, SilverRuns, that you are better.

1180
01:17:58,490 --> 01:17:59,530
So you better not die here.

1181
01:17:59,790 --> 01:18:00,950
Oh, and he died.

1182
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:03,650
I'm telling ya.

1183
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:05,690
The spectator first.

1184
01:18:05,690 --> 01:18:08,010
I think I'm just a big hater.

1185
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:09,330
That's all it is.

1186
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:10,910
Wait, which team is...

1187
01:18:10,910 --> 01:18:14,030
Is he also on SmallAnt's team?

1188
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:16,730
Yeah, yeah, he's on the SmallAnt Feinberg team.

1189
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:20,270
Well, let's see who's gonna make more contributions.

1190
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:21,670
Feinberg or Silver.

1191
01:18:22,050 --> 01:18:22,310
True.

1192
01:18:22,530 --> 01:18:23,930
We're gonna find out who's the MVP.

1193
01:18:24,990 --> 01:18:26,690
Who's gonna be the MVP here?

1194
01:18:29,630 --> 01:18:32,190
Dude, the Hoglins have cool little mohawks.

1195
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:33,630
Rainbow mohawks.

1196
01:18:34,150 --> 01:18:34,890
That's so cool.

1197
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:36,650
I don't see...

1198
01:18:36,650 --> 01:18:39,790
Next time, you'll notice it now.

1199
01:18:40,010 --> 01:18:40,890
Look, the pig in the background.

1200
01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:41,090
Look!

1201
01:18:42,910 --> 01:18:44,550
Oh my god, he does.

1202
01:18:44,770 --> 01:18:46,390
He has a little rainbow mohawk.

1203
01:18:47,710 --> 01:18:48,730
That's cute.

1204
01:18:49,930 --> 01:18:50,470
Oh, wow.

1205
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:52,650
Are they going for GumGum?

1206
01:18:53,570 --> 01:18:54,810
No, GumGum!

1207
01:18:55,890 --> 01:18:56,310
Oh, wait.

1208
01:18:56,530 --> 01:18:58,610
No, they're avoiding GumGum.

1209
01:18:58,830 --> 01:19:00,490
They don't need GumGum.

1210
01:19:00,790 --> 01:19:03,050
I thought they were gonna go solo the...

1211
01:19:03,050 --> 01:19:05,250
Oh, BlueTower under attack.

1212
01:19:06,030 --> 01:19:07,010
Reda pushing.

1213
01:19:07,050 --> 01:19:08,470
Reda pushing and killing Blue's tower.

1214
01:19:08,470 --> 01:19:10,170
Yeah, where the heck is Blue Tower?

1215
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:14,630
Yeah, I kinda can't tell which tower is which.

1216
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:16,910
Yeah, I don't know which color is which.

1217
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:18,250
There's Feinberg.

1218
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:20,970
Got a kill and is just farming this spawner over here.

1219
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:22,270
Getting as much coins as he can.

1220
01:19:22,710 --> 01:19:24,710
Oh, getting as much upgrades.

1221
01:19:26,230 --> 01:19:29,010
I'm sure these guys have already analyzed which upgrade is best.

1222
01:19:29,210 --> 01:19:31,090
It's actually best to upgrade this to level 2.

1223
01:19:31,130 --> 01:19:32,750
But don't upgrade it to level 3.

1224
01:19:32,770 --> 01:19:33,490
Did they grind this before the tournament?

1225
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:35,730
Well, they've got the documents.

1226
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:39,610
And if I know anything about the red team here...

1227
01:19:39,610 --> 01:19:41,770
These guys probably had a meeting like an hour ago.

1228
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:43,790
Going like, okay, this is the strategy.

1229
01:19:43,930 --> 01:19:44,510
We gotta do this.

1230
01:19:44,590 --> 01:19:45,210
We gotta do this.

1231
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:47,530
This game is already out, right?

1232
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:50,270
So they could've practiced beforehand, right?

1233
01:19:51,030 --> 01:19:51,350
True.

1234
01:19:51,510 --> 01:19:52,910
I don't know how they practice though.

1235
01:19:53,070 --> 01:19:54,930
I don't think these servers are public.

1236
01:19:55,150 --> 01:19:56,370
I don't think you can just play.

1237
01:19:56,970 --> 01:19:58,270
You can't just play it?

1238
01:19:58,390 --> 01:19:59,410
I don't know.

1239
01:19:59,490 --> 01:19:59,670
Maybe.

1240
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:01,450
I don't think so.

1241
01:20:02,370 --> 01:20:04,610
I think these guys have played in this event before.

1242
01:20:04,770 --> 01:20:06,030
But I'm not sure if it's...

1243
01:20:06,030 --> 01:20:08,130
I don't know if you can just play anytime.

1244
01:20:08,690 --> 01:20:09,550
Oh, so like...

1245
01:20:09,550 --> 01:20:11,530
These servers...

1246
01:20:11,530 --> 01:20:13,230
It's only for tournament only.

1247
01:20:13,230 --> 01:20:14,070
I think so.

1248
01:20:15,530 --> 01:20:17,130
I don't want to get this wrong.

1249
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:19,370
I'm the pro and I don't know for certain.

1250
01:20:19,670 --> 01:20:21,770
You're here to be our Minecraft analysis.

1251
01:20:22,010 --> 01:20:24,250
Is our Minecraft analysis guy gonna lie to us?

1252
01:20:24,470 --> 01:20:25,510
Am I actually trolling?

1253
01:20:25,790 --> 01:20:26,270
Oh my god.

1254
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:30,810
Red tower under attack.

1255
01:20:31,370 --> 01:20:32,070
Thank you.

1256
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:33,110
Thank you, voice line.

1257
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:34,650
Red tower under attack.

1258
01:20:36,050 --> 01:20:36,690
Oh my god.

1259
01:20:36,810 --> 01:20:37,730
Thank god they told us.

1260
01:20:37,810 --> 01:20:38,850
I would have never known.

1261
01:20:40,190 --> 01:20:43,250
I actually wouldn't because we're just watching people fight.

1262
01:20:43,690 --> 01:20:45,450
Wait, red tower is taking so much damage.

1263
01:20:45,910 --> 01:20:46,190
Oh my god.

1264
01:20:46,450 --> 01:20:46,690
We already had yellow.

1265
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:50,850
Looks like team blue are actually putting in the work here.

1266
01:20:51,370 --> 01:20:53,330
Maybe it's just because team red trusts each other.

1267
01:20:53,410 --> 01:20:54,890
They go, yep, you're gonna go back to base.

1268
01:20:54,890 --> 01:20:55,590
You're gonna defend.

1269
01:20:55,810 --> 01:20:57,270
And look, they're not taking damage anymore.

1270
01:20:57,450 --> 01:20:58,150
And not anymore, yeah.

1271
01:20:58,910 --> 01:21:01,590
Maybe they're relying on the timer.

1272
01:21:01,810 --> 01:21:06,030
Remember when the timer went lower and then all the towers got hit?

1273
01:21:06,490 --> 01:21:06,690
True.

1274
01:21:06,690 --> 01:21:07,850
There's no timer anymore.

1275
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:10,590
It starts at 10 minutes.

1276
01:21:11,210 --> 01:21:12,090
Oh, okay, okay.

1277
01:21:12,210 --> 01:21:14,030
I wonder if they're waiting for that.

1278
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:17,210
Because I feel like it's not that worth it.

1279
01:21:17,490 --> 01:21:19,270
All the towers are just gonna take damage.

1280
01:21:19,670 --> 01:21:21,090
Gum gum got hit!

1281
01:21:22,610 --> 01:21:24,070
Gum gum, no!

1282
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:26,950
Nobody is paying attention to gum gum.

1283
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:27,810
It's kinda sad.

1284
01:21:30,370 --> 01:21:31,490
Maybe he just...

1285
01:21:31,490 --> 01:21:32,470
There he is!

1286
01:21:33,810 --> 01:21:35,750
Yeah, slap him!

1287
01:21:36,050 --> 01:21:37,190
Slap gum gum!

1288
01:21:40,130 --> 01:21:40,870
That's right.

1289
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:43,130
He's been a naughty gum gum.

1290
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:43,790
2v1.

1291
01:21:44,930 --> 01:21:46,490
I feel like Flamberg is not winning that one.

1292
01:21:47,950 --> 01:21:50,550
Maybe blue can take out the entirety of gum gum here.

1293
01:21:51,270 --> 01:21:52,110
They might be able to do it.

1294
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:55,190
Hold on, someone's going for defending.

1295
01:21:55,890 --> 01:21:57,130
Oh, he ulted.

1296
01:21:57,370 --> 01:21:58,110
That has to be an ult.

1297
01:21:58,750 --> 01:21:59,050
Yeah.

1298
01:22:00,230 --> 01:22:02,410
Oh, he's chasing gum gum.

1299
01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:04,650
Oh, here's the backup.

1300
01:22:04,990 --> 01:22:05,890
Cavalry's arrived.

1301
01:22:06,170 --> 01:22:07,170
The backup is here.

1302
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:10,690
Oh, he almost died for that too.

1303
01:22:11,290 --> 01:22:14,150
Wait, the red team has so many people dead already.

1304
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:17,590
They had like two people dead earlier.

1305
01:22:18,770 --> 01:22:20,070
Oh, 2v3 now.

1306
01:22:21,010 --> 01:22:26,350
I feel like the plan is just let the other team get gum gum low and then come in for the steal.

1307
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:28,850
Dude, I think these guys just won a 2v3.

1308
01:22:29,190 --> 01:22:34,690
I think the blue team just completely walked into their trap and like gave them 1v1s for no reason.

1309
01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:35,690
Wait, what happened?

1310
01:22:35,710 --> 01:22:36,370
How did he die?

1311
01:22:38,630 --> 01:22:40,410
Does gum gum deal back?

1312
01:22:40,910 --> 01:22:41,450
Oh my god.

1313
01:22:42,610 --> 01:22:43,790
Gum gum hits back, bro.

1314
01:22:45,510 --> 01:22:47,250
Yeah, I was like, how did he die?

1315
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:48,030
How did he die?

1316
01:22:54,460 --> 01:22:55,800
Let's go, gum gum.

1317
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,460
Defend yourself, gum gum.

1318
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:02,560
Oh, we have the red team rushing.

1319
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:03,480
They're pushing.

1320
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:04,880
Oh, nevermind, blue team too.

1321
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:06,780
Look out below!

1322
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:08,680
Oh, look out below!

1323
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:11,360
0-3 marked.

1324
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:13,120
There you go.

1325
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:15,140
It looks like red got it.

1326
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:17,140
Red team got it.

1327
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:18,860
They used two ults for it.

1328
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:19,460
You see that?

1329
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:21,040
They have like 3% ult now.

1330
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:21,560
Oh yeah.

1331
01:23:32,940 --> 01:23:36,880
That's gotta be like an iron golem with a cool skin or something, right?

1332
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,480
Like, I think that's the case.

1333
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:41,100
I think it's just gonna be like a teammate that can run in.

1334
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:43,460
But you're right, I think the ult was used there.

1335
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,740
Is it good to use it on the middle boss?

1336
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:46,120
Maybe.

1337
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:47,440
I don't know.

1338
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,520
I mean, more money.

1339
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:50,600
They also got kills from it too.

1340
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:51,300
That's what I'm thinking.

1341
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:56,580
So I feel like it's good just because the blue team was just there for it.

1342
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:57,540
Oh, see, look.

1343
01:23:57,640 --> 01:24:01,600
The timer started for the the half HP.

1344
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:02,860
It starts at like...

1345
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:04,940
I think it starts at like 9 or 8 minutes.

1346
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:06,160
Not 10.

1347
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:11,160
The only issue is that now blue team has a lot of ults for this fight.

1348
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:17,440
Oh, they still died.

1349
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:26,040
I feel like there was more damage on the towers at this point last time.

1350
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:27,540
Last match that we had.

1351
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:28,780
Really?

1352
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:30,900
Maybe I'm wrong.

1353
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:33,060
Maybe the analysis guys...

1354
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:36,460
They got like the withers already, didn't they?

1355
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:37,560
At least one of the withers.

1356
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:38,320
That's what I thought.

1357
01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:40,060
I thought they had a wither down by now.

1358
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:43,440
So maybe these guys are playing more defensive than the other team that we watched.

1359
01:24:44,260 --> 01:24:46,120
Or maybe this map just is a bit too...

1360
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:47,040
Yeah.

1361
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:48,640
This map is a little bizarre.

1362
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:50,600
It looks huge.

1363
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:53,400
There's people at the bottom now versus the top.

1364
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:57,860
It feels like there's so many places to defend versus the others.

1365
01:24:58,100 --> 01:24:58,560
Right.

1366
01:24:59,080 --> 01:24:59,720
The other one.

1367
01:25:00,980 --> 01:25:03,920
Oh my god, how am I going to communicate all that?

1368
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:06,120
Red's attacking blue.

1369
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:08,240
Oh, but look, they teleported back.

1370
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:10,240
Oh, he leaves.

1371
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:12,000
Oh, unless...

1372
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:12,340
2v1.

1373
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:15,420
Oh, he won the 2v1.

1374
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:16,420
Wait, did he?

1375
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:16,740
No.

1376
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:19,400
Oh, he teleported back, yeah.

1377
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:22,020
One of them died from it.

1378
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:22,860
From that fight.

1379
01:25:23,220 --> 01:25:24,340
Their rabbit boy died.

1380
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:25,700
That's a good trade still.

1381
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:28,960
Look, they're jumping down trying to avoid the fight but still getting chased.

1382
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:31,900
Yeah, there's no fall damage.

1383
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:34,580
There's no fall damage for it.

1384
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:37,100
Oh, there's his teammates His teammates are right there though.

1385
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:41,500
Oh, the creeps saved them.

1386
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:44,540
What a hero.

1387
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:46,100
Oh, nevermind.

1388
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:47,400
He's going in.

1389
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:49,860
Curry you.

1390
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:54,480
3v1.

1391
01:25:59,910 --> 01:25:59,930
Oh.

1392
01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:02,250
Oh my god.

1393
01:26:02,470 --> 01:26:05,210
Oh my god, there's a blue sheep.

1394
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:10,810
Red is so focused on this 2v1 that they're not focused on their towers.

1395
01:26:10,930 --> 01:26:11,410
They're getting damaged.

1396
01:26:12,610 --> 01:26:15,250
Oh my god, they're hiding down there.

1397
01:26:16,090 --> 01:26:18,170
Whose tower is getting hit right now?

1398
01:26:19,170 --> 01:26:20,670
I don't think anyone's tower is getting hit.

1399
01:26:20,670 --> 01:26:21,290
I think they're okay.

1400
01:26:21,410 --> 01:26:22,250
There's a big fight.

1401
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:25,070
Blue is pretty good about defending their tower.

1402
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:26,230
Yeah, yeah.

1403
01:26:27,010 --> 01:26:28,250
DTMC is going crazy.

1404
01:26:28,490 --> 01:26:31,070
And look, they're dealing some damage on the towers.

1405
01:26:31,950 --> 01:26:32,790
That wither is nearly dead.

1406
01:26:32,970 --> 01:26:33,830
That wither is dead.

1407
01:26:34,590 --> 01:26:35,690
Oh my god.

1408
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:37,230
Red wither gone.

1409
01:26:37,390 --> 01:26:38,630
One red wither is gone.

1410
01:26:38,910 --> 01:26:40,390
One red wither gone.

1411
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:43,510
I think you might be a jinx, man.

1412
01:26:43,550 --> 01:26:44,590
I told you.

1413
01:26:45,010 --> 01:26:47,170
I told you.

1414
01:26:47,290 --> 01:26:48,270
I told you.

1415
01:26:48,790 --> 01:26:51,250
I think you might be a jinx, man.

1416
01:26:51,310 --> 01:26:52,890
That's crazy because like...

1417
01:26:52,890 --> 01:26:55,250
Smallhead's team is so stacked, not gonna lie.

1418
01:26:56,850 --> 01:26:57,370
Like...

1419
01:26:58,050 --> 01:26:59,610
Their team is like...

1420
01:26:59,610 --> 01:27:00,970
Really, really stacked.

1421
01:27:01,670 --> 01:27:03,750
I wonder if it's the map or what.

1422
01:27:04,310 --> 01:27:07,430
Maybe they're just focusing their priorities in the wrong places.

1423
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:08,090
Dude, wow.

1424
01:27:08,150 --> 01:27:11,250
I think there's like four blue guys running down this mid lane right now.

1425
01:27:11,290 --> 01:27:11,350
Dude, wow.

1426
01:27:11,350 --> 01:27:11,370
I think there's like four blue guys running down this mid lane right now.

1427
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:12,190
Look, 4v1.

1428
01:27:12,970 --> 01:27:13,650
There we go, look.

1429
01:27:14,450 --> 01:27:16,430
Blue are launching a big attack here.

1430
01:27:16,990 --> 01:27:17,990
And they've got ults.

1431
01:27:18,110 --> 01:27:19,170
Look at their ults as well.

1432
01:27:19,530 --> 01:27:20,470
Okay, there's...

1433
01:27:20,470 --> 01:27:21,570
There's three.

1434
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:23,550
There's the ult coming out.

1435
01:27:23,670 --> 01:27:25,370
The army is here.

1436
01:27:26,890 --> 01:27:28,810
I'm on fire today, baby.

1437
01:27:30,410 --> 01:27:32,190
I'm on fire today, baby.

1438
01:27:34,370 --> 01:27:35,090
Oh, man.

1439
01:27:37,170 --> 01:27:38,510
Wow, they got a crystal down.

1440
01:27:38,590 --> 01:27:39,250
They got a crystal.

1441
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:41,610
Oh, it's not all the way down.

1442
01:27:41,710 --> 01:27:42,330
It's not all the way down.

1443
01:27:43,170 --> 01:27:45,270
But they used all their ults for that, though.

1444
01:27:46,630 --> 01:27:48,010
They used all their ults for that.

1445
01:27:48,150 --> 01:27:49,050
Oh, they're heading back.

1446
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:51,270
Oh my god, here's the counterattack.

1447
01:27:51,830 --> 01:27:52,550
They're pushing.

1448
01:27:54,570 --> 01:27:55,750
They need to, man.

1449
01:27:55,830 --> 01:27:56,950
They really need to.

1450
01:27:57,150 --> 01:28:00,330
This is the perfect time, especially if, you know, they killed a lot of the enemies.

1451
01:28:00,330 --> 01:28:01,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1452
01:28:01,270 --> 01:28:02,830
Minecraft analysis guy.

1453
01:28:03,910 --> 01:28:05,090
Is it like...

1454
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:07,790
Is the blue team less stacked than red team?

1455
01:28:08,370 --> 01:28:09,890
If I had to say, yeah, definitely.

1456
01:28:10,490 --> 01:28:12,090
I know that...

1457
01:28:12,090 --> 01:28:13,590
I'm not trying to be nasty, right?

1458
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:16,070
I like the blue team as well.

1459
01:28:16,630 --> 01:28:19,970
But blue team definitely feel like they have one big carry.

1460
01:28:20,430 --> 01:28:23,870
And that's going to be Fire Breath Man, which is the bunny boy.

1461
01:28:24,870 --> 01:28:26,130
A bunny boy.

1462
01:28:26,490 --> 01:28:27,250
A rabbit boy.

1463
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:30,450
Yeah, rabbit boy is probably the best player on the blue team right now.

1464
01:28:30,550 --> 01:28:31,210
Fire Breath Man.

1465
01:28:31,750 --> 01:28:35,990
But I think that there's probably like two or three really good red teamers.

1466
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:37,570
So, I don't know, but...

1467
01:28:38,070 --> 01:28:39,850
Does red team have a bunny boy?

1468
01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:42,930
I think they... do they?

1469
01:28:43,190 --> 01:28:43,570
I don't know.

1470
01:28:43,770 --> 01:28:44,310
Yeah, they do.

1471
01:28:44,590 --> 01:28:45,070
Oh, there we go.

1472
01:28:45,210 --> 01:28:47,510
I was like, what?

1473
01:28:47,770 --> 01:28:48,430
There he is.

1474
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:49,470
I thought I saw it earlier.

1475
01:28:50,230 --> 01:28:50,990
But I'm going to be honest.

1476
01:28:51,070 --> 01:28:52,590
It looks like blue team are doing better.

1477
01:28:52,690 --> 01:28:53,630
They've got a crystal down.

1478
01:28:53,710 --> 01:28:54,730
They've got a tower down.

1479
01:28:54,730 --> 01:28:55,570
Yeah.

1480
01:28:55,970 --> 01:28:57,610
No, blue team is 100% doing better.

1481
01:28:58,530 --> 01:28:59,010
They...

1482
01:28:59,950 --> 01:29:05,070
I feel like red team has not been focusing on attacking the base at all.

1483
01:29:05,530 --> 01:29:07,170
Maybe there's some secret.

1484
01:29:07,310 --> 01:29:08,670
Maybe red's just gearing up.

1485
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:11,610
Maybe they've got all of the attack that they need right now.

1486
01:29:11,710 --> 01:29:13,430
I mean, red do have three ults.

1487
01:29:14,010 --> 01:29:15,470
We'll see in like four minutes.

1488
01:29:16,410 --> 01:29:17,370
Look down below.

1489
01:29:17,910 --> 01:29:21,440
Look down below.

1490
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:23,120
Oh, red are finally attacking.

1491
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:23,660
Here we go.

1492
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:26,440
Oh, they're getting two withers maybe.

1493
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:26,880
Oh.

1494
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:29,720
Okay, one down.

1495
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:30,280
Nice.

1496
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:31,140
One down.

1497
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:32,780
They might be able to grab another crystal.

1498
01:29:35,060 --> 01:29:36,160
Oh, they might be able to get two.

1499
01:29:36,420 --> 01:29:37,360
Oh my god.

1500
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:38,200
Trust the plan.

1501
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:39,520
Trust the plan.

1502
01:29:40,420 --> 01:29:41,240
They wanted us to think that...

1503
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:43,700
Look at this attack.

1504
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:45,820
Red with a gun.

1505
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:48,340
Finebug's trying to take out two here.

1506
01:29:48,540 --> 01:29:49,300
Takes out one.

1507
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:51,360
They might get another wither.

1508
01:29:51,740 --> 01:29:52,840
They might get another crystal here.

1509
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:54,020
Oh, wait.

1510
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:54,940
That's so close.

1511
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:55,620
Oh my god.

1512
01:29:55,660 --> 01:29:56,780
We should have trusted the plan.

1513
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:58,000
We should have trusted the plan.

1514
01:29:58,020 --> 01:29:59,860
There's a second crystal.

1515
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:02,460
I'm assuming... Oh my god.

1516
01:30:02,540 --> 01:30:03,060
Just one more.

1517
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:03,600
Oh my god.

1518
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:04,420
Just one more wither.

1519
01:30:04,540 --> 01:30:05,460
They're all dead though.

1520
01:30:05,820 --> 01:30:08,420
What a crazy counter-attack by red, man.

1521
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:09,460
That was so cool.

1522
01:30:11,660 --> 01:30:12,840
Yeah, but they still have like two...

1523
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:16,220
They're going to do a counter-attack and they only have two people alive.

1524
01:30:17,060 --> 01:30:17,580
Oh, no.

1525
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:18,300
They're going to get hurt.

1526
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:21,340
I think the respawns are going to be okay, I think.

1527
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:25,340
And rad still has her ultimate ability as well.

1528
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:27,080
Well, meow and smallant still have another...

1529
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:27,720
Oh, no.

1530
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:28,100
Just kidding.

1531
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:28,980
Meow has another.

1532
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:30,100
Oh, just kidding.

1533
01:30:30,460 --> 01:30:31,980
No, rad has her ult.

1534
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:32,980
Or their ult.

1535
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:33,600
Yeah, yeah.

1536
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:35,060
No, I just meant the respawn.

1537
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:36,280
Oh, respawn.

1538
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:36,540
Yeah.

1539
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:37,220
They're all back.

1540
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:37,740
Yeah.

1541
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:42,360
So, it looks like both teams kind of have one ult left now.

1542
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:44,100
Oh my god.

1543
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:44,820
He's hulking up.

1544
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:46,160
The tower's gone.

1545
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:49,320
Just the one crystal left.

1546
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:50,480
With his last swing.

1547
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:51,460
Oh my god.

1548
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:54,840
Feinberg dies there, but it's...

1549
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,560
Wait, two people already...

1550
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:58,600
Wait, three people already dead.

1551
01:30:58,880 --> 01:30:59,860
Blue team is still up.

1552
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:02,260
Oh, smallant's hiding.

1553
01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:03,080
Oh, no.

1554
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:03,740
He gets found.

1555
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:04,640
Oh, no.

1556
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:08,480
But look, he's leading the entire team downstairs.

1557
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:10,800
Maybe this is a good counter-attack chance.

1558
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:14,580
I mean, their respawns are back now.

1559
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:17,380
All the respawns are back, but...

1560
01:31:17,380 --> 01:31:20,320
Just dragging this one player away is so smart.

1561
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:21,520
Wait, there's only one crystal left.

1562
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:23,280
For blue team.

1563
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:28,440
He's coming.

1564
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:31,140
He's on the hunt.

1565
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,080
He's distracted by the hunt.

1566
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:39,980
He saw the distraction and he was like, oh my...

1567
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:42,780
Mob break, you know?

1568
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:44,820
Just a little ADHD there.

1569
01:31:47,740 --> 01:31:48,880
This one is huge.

1570
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:50,920
He's cool as a cucumber.

1571
01:31:51,140 --> 01:31:52,680
His heart rate is only 85.

1572
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:55,140
He knows what he's doing.

1573
01:31:55,540 --> 01:31:58,120
He just went for a little detour.

1574
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:03,400
The red team is pushing.

1575
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:08,260
I don't think they're going to take the 1v3 here.

1576
01:32:08,380 --> 01:32:10,040
No, red team dies.

1577
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:12,840
I think that might be Feinberg in the back there.

1578
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:15,120
Feinberg is there, killing the crystal.

1579
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:18,900
The crystal is down!

1580
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:23,240
Feinberg dies, but it's down to the dragon.

1581
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:26,320
They had the dragon.

1582
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,060
I mean, you've got to be favoriting the red team here.

1583
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:33,120
I think red team are probably the...

1584
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:36,400
The favorites right now, yeah.

1585
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:40,460
The content team, that's brilliant.

1586
01:32:40,460 --> 01:32:41,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1587
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,120
But I mean, blue are pushing.

1588
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:47,740
Look, they're trying to flank outside of this mid lane.

1589
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,440
Oh, they got a kill though.

1590
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:51,060
They got one guy over there.

1591
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:52,480
He was like...

1592
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:55,940
Oh my gosh, that's so much damage.

1593
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,480
Red tower is almost dead.

1594
01:32:58,680 --> 01:32:59,560
Almost done, yeah.

1595
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:02,960
Yeah, but they still didn't get the two other crystals.

1596
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:05,520
But they're half down.

1597
01:33:05,660 --> 01:33:08,020
Yeah, it's because of the timer thing.

1598
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:09,160
Remember when they...

1599
01:33:10,020 --> 01:33:12,080
They did the timer thing where...

1600
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:13,420
Oh, GumGum's back!

1601
01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:23,120
I'm coming, I'm back!

1602
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:25,020
I'm coming for you!

1603
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:27,580
GumGum!

1604
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:35,440
Who just went in there?

1605
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:39,280
Oh, red team are dealing damage to the dragon finally.

1606
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:40,420
Oh, they're ulting.

1607
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:42,780
Oh, they're dying though.

1608
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:43,680
Oh, wow.

1609
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:45,380
Yeah, this is gonna be it, surely.

1610
01:33:46,660 --> 01:33:48,540
I'm on fire today, baby!

1611
01:33:49,220 --> 01:33:50,160
If they could ult!

1612
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:53,460
Blue used an ult and got them dead.

1613
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:55,900
They're so close.

1614
01:33:55,980 --> 01:33:57,640
They have to do a counter-attack right now.

1615
01:33:58,560 --> 01:33:59,180
But there's only two of them.

1616
01:33:59,180 --> 01:34:01,300
Even just one guy sneaking in would be...

1617
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:02,720
Yeah, one guy is enough.

1618
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:04,180
We saw that last game, right?

1619
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:05,860
GumGum, shoo!

1620
01:34:05,860 --> 01:34:08,860
Just need to get five or six hits on that dragon and it's gonna be over.

1621
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:10,120
GumGum's just sitting there.

1622
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:11,640
No, don't kill GumGum!

1623
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:14,900
I want GumGum to just slap them and then they fall.

1624
01:34:17,180 --> 01:34:18,560
Just one little shot.

1625
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:20,880
Dude, red almost have their ults back as well.

1626
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:22,500
Look, 83, 81.

1627
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:25,020
Yeah, they just need one good ult.

1628
01:34:26,380 --> 01:34:28,300
If they, like, defend...

1629
01:34:28,300 --> 01:34:30,660
If red can defend this, they can just counter-attack and win.

1630
01:34:30,660 --> 01:34:31,360
Yeah, for real.

1631
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:33,180
And it's a 4v3 in red's favor.

1632
01:34:34,780 --> 01:34:36,480
I think, like, red is...

1633
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:38,560
I can't tell, but does red have more money?

1634
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,680
I think they do because they got GumGum in the middle, right?

1635
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:43,380
They got the first GumGum, that is.

1636
01:34:43,620 --> 01:34:43,840
Yeah.

1637
01:34:43,980 --> 01:34:45,340
Oh, they won the fight.

1638
01:34:45,780 --> 01:34:47,740
They killed almost everybody in blue.

1639
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,000
But I think two of blue survived.

1640
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:51,580
Yeah, two blue survived.

1641
01:34:51,780 --> 01:34:53,940
Oh, there's one more defender, though.

1642
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:56,180
Yeah, yeah, there's one more.

1643
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:57,500
There goes one!

1644
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:58,440
They're onto the crystal.

1645
01:34:59,000 --> 01:34:59,940
Okay, one blue down.

1646
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:02,280
There's the second blue gone.

1647
01:35:02,380 --> 01:35:04,560
They need some sort of counter-attack now, though.

1648
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:05,920
Oh, he hid!

1649
01:35:05,940 --> 01:35:09,040
Smallman tried to hide, but not gonna get the death.

1650
01:35:09,860 --> 01:35:11,920
He tried to hide to get the...

1651
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:12,840
That's smart.

1652
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,180
That's such a smart, like, tactic.

1653
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,500
When they're rushing to the other base.

1654
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:19,420
Yeah, hiding over there.

1655
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:22,820
Yeah, hiding over there just for the sneak attack.

1656
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:24,040
GumGum!

1657
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:25,760
Oh, are they gonna kill GumGum?

1658
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:26,440
I'm surprised.

1659
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:28,900
They're wasting time!

1660
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:29,980
They're wasting time!

1661
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:33,460
You just need to do this much damage to the dragon.

1662
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:35,540
Oh, maybe.

1663
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:37,440
What if there's one guy on the outside?

1664
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:40,120
Maybe they're using him as a distraction.

1665
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:41,500
Where did he fly to?

1666
01:35:41,540 --> 01:35:42,240
Did you see that?

1667
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:44,280
Watch out below!

1668
01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:48,620
It kind of worked, as well.

1669
01:35:48,700 --> 01:35:49,340
Look at this!

1670
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:52,980
Finebug falls off, and now it's a 4v2!

1671
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:55,860
This is huge, actually.

1672
01:35:55,980 --> 01:35:56,920
This is actually insane.

1673
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:58,140
Blue could do this!

1674
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:00,980
Blue can come back here.

1675
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:02,080
It's a 4v0!

1676
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:05,200
Finebug's alive, but what's he gonna do?

1677
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:06,980
It's one defender against four!

1678
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:11,040
Power down, they're killing the crystal.

1679
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:13,180
Finebug has his ult.

1680
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:15,400
Can Finebug's ult actually work?

1681
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:19,720
Oh my god, SmallAnt!

1682
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:22,020
He's on his own!

1683
01:36:22,060 --> 01:36:23,220
Can SmallAnt win?

1684
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:24,360
He's dealing damage!

1685
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:26,360
SmallAnt one-mans it!

1686
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:33,980
SmallAnt snuck around, just like he did!

1687
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:36,700
The one guy!

1688
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:39,840
You muted yourself, you were so excited.

1689
01:36:41,300 --> 01:36:43,980
What an absolutely beautiful kill, there.

1690
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:47,000
That was so close!

1691
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
That was actually so crazy.

1692
01:36:50,860 --> 01:36:57,300
That was really smart to let them take out the tower, so they wouldn't notice that someone was killing the dragon.

1693
01:36:57,860 --> 01:37:02,060
They thought they were waiting for respawn, but he was just on the other side of the map.

1694
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:05,980
They basically baited him.

1695
01:37:07,220 --> 01:37:10,920
They baited the entire team to get closer to the dragon, so they could sneak in.

1696
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:11,940
That's insane.

1697
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:15,300
So he dropped down, he dropped down purposely just to do a flank.

1698
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:15,820
That was smart.

1699
01:37:16,460 --> 01:37:18,360
Yeah, that was incredibly smart.

1700
01:37:19,020 --> 01:37:19,660
Wow.

1701
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,520
That was a close game.

1702
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:23,460
That was a really close game.

1703
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:25,560
See, you're not a jinx!

1704
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:26,620
I know!

1705
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:28,500
The comeback!

1706
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:33,120
I never doubted them for a second!

1707
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:34,520
But maybe one second.

1708
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:36,660
Yeah, just for a little bit.

1709
01:37:36,740 --> 01:37:38,360
Just one percent of that.

1710
01:37:38,660 --> 01:37:40,300
It was risky though.

1711
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:48,120
Especially if all four of them were hitting the other dragon, they could have been getting more damage.

1712
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:49,540
They could have out-timed, yeah.

1713
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:51,560
I didn't know what ult that is.

1714
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:56,880
A giant cat in the middle just running around.

1715
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:57,860
A green cat.

1716
01:37:58,900 --> 01:38:00,760
Just like, I'm ulting out.

1717
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:07,380
It's so big compared to everybody too.

1718
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:08,560
I know!

1719
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:09,100
I know!

1720
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:10,380
That's funny.

1721
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:15,980
The spam damage is kind of crazy.

1722
01:38:16,220 --> 01:38:18,680
I don't think I played Minecraft when that was...

1723
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:19,500
I don't know actually.

1724
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:21,140
I never did think of competitive.

1725
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:22,200
I haven't either.

1726
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:26,100
I used to spam damage and then my chat would yell at me.

1727
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:27,680
Stop spamming!

1728
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:31,120
You're not getting the optimal strong hits!

1729
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:31,960
Yeah.

1730
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:34,380
Now we can give an excuse.

1731
01:38:34,820 --> 01:38:37,280
It's because we were watching this MOBA tournament.

1732
01:38:37,580 --> 01:38:39,540
So we thought it was the thing.

1733
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:40,620
We thought, yeah.

1734
01:38:41,540 --> 01:38:43,600
We were watching professionals.

1735
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:46,700
If they did it, I would do it.

1736
01:38:47,180 --> 01:38:48,720
Yeah, that's what we learned.

1737
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:52,880
Wow.

1738
01:38:53,140 --> 01:38:56,820
Okay, so we actually do have all the teams for round two.

1739
01:38:56,820 --> 01:39:01,660
For that, we have team Hannah winning round two.

1740
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:03,960
Again, that's their second win.

1741
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:04,960
Who did they win against?

1742
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:07,080
Team Snifferfish.

1743
01:39:08,180 --> 01:39:13,380
Team Sparkles won against Team S Major.

1744
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:17,780
Team SmallAnt won against Team BTSC.

1745
01:39:17,780 --> 01:39:19,280
No, no bias or anything.

1746
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:20,800
Sorry, no bias, no bias.

1747
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:23,180
No caster bias, of course.

1748
01:39:23,380 --> 01:39:24,240
No, of course not.

1749
01:39:25,220 --> 01:39:28,240
Team FiveUp wins against Team Shubble.

1750
01:39:30,740 --> 01:39:33,220
Team Shubble and Team BTSC.

1751
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:35,600
They both have two losses.

1752
01:39:36,980 --> 01:39:39,880
So next game would be the final group stage.

1753
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:42,520
And after that would be semis and then finals.

1754
01:39:42,980 --> 01:39:44,320
So we'll see how it goes from there.

1755
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:48,560
Has the matchup for the next group stage been up yet or no?

1756
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:51,500
No, not...

1757
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:52,180
Oh wait, yes it is.

1758
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:53,160
Sorry, I'm a liar.

1759
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:56,400
So round three, we're in Sweet Peaks, baby!

1760
01:39:57,120 --> 01:39:57,620
Wow!

1761
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:01,620
Sweet Peaks, we have...

1762
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:04,960
Team Snifferfish versus Team Sparkles.

1763
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:08,180
Team Hana versus Team S Major.

1764
01:40:08,900 --> 01:40:11,260
Team SmallAnt versus Team FiveUp.

1765
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:15,320
And Team BTSC versus Team Shubble.

1766
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:17,280
I don't know who to watch.

1767
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:21,740
Has anyone watched Team Hana, Team Sparkles, and Team SmallAnt?

1768
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:22,560
Yeah.

1769
01:40:23,240 --> 01:40:26,460
I don't really know the other teams as well.

1770
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:27,240
I don't either.

1771
01:40:27,380 --> 01:40:29,200
We'll wait for Fulham to come back.

1772
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:29,940
Yeah, Fulham.

1773
01:40:30,700 --> 01:40:33,680
Our professional Minecraft analysis guy.

1774
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:35,680
How do you...

1775
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:36,860
I wonder if he has a degree.

1776
01:40:37,820 --> 01:40:38,400
In Minecraft?

1777
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:41,380
In what?

1778
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:44,420
In Minecraft, yeah.

1779
01:40:44,420 --> 01:40:45,140
Yeah.

1780
01:40:48,150 --> 01:40:49,900
Oh, they're saying...

1781
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:51,920
SmallAnt versus FiveUp.

1782
01:40:52,060 --> 01:40:53,880
We don't get a choice.

1783
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:56,000
We don't...

1784
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Oh no, the spectator!

1785
01:40:58,140 --> 01:40:59,940
Oh no, the spectator curse!

1786
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:03,760
I'm eating my popcorn.

1787
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,760
Oh yeah, your popcorn.

1788
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,580
Wait, did you tell Chad that you brought popcorn to eat for the tournament?

1789
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:11,060
Yeah, no I didn't.

1790
01:41:11,060 --> 01:41:12,520
The guys that have popcorn.

1791
01:41:12,820 --> 01:41:15,320
Yeah, she has popcorn for this...

1792
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:17,440
For this exciting tournament.

1793
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:19,000
Oh yeah, wait.

1794
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:20,840
Our British Captain Sparkles is back.

1795
01:41:21,180 --> 01:41:22,740
Oh, British Captain Sparkles, welcome back.

1796
01:41:22,820 --> 01:41:25,140
I think our Chad's gonna forget what his actual name is.

1797
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:25,960
With the stuff we're saying.

1798
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:30,980
We just keep calling him like, Minecraft Analysis Guy and British Captain Sparkles.

1799
01:41:31,100 --> 01:41:32,500
I say Fulham.

1800
01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:33,340
Fulham.

1801
01:41:33,340 --> 01:41:34,800
He has a name.

1802
01:41:37,140 --> 01:41:38,100
Big Ham.

1803
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:38,180
Big Ham.

1804
01:41:45,660 --> 01:41:46,620
Large Pig.

1805
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:53,680
British Commentator Man.

1806
01:41:55,640 --> 01:41:56,940
Oh, there he is.

1807
01:41:56,980 --> 01:41:57,680
Oh, there's a shop.

1808
01:41:57,980 --> 01:42:03,560
I love that one time when their dragons were getting attacked and then they just went to the shopkeeper.

1809
01:42:07,420 --> 01:42:11,840
When your dragons get attacked, it's not time to shop right now.

1810
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:14,840
It's not shopping time.

1811
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:17,300
I think we're at Sweet Peaks now.

1812
01:42:17,420 --> 01:42:18,980
That's the map that we're at.

1813
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:20,180
Oh, it's like...

1814
01:42:20,180 --> 01:42:21,460
It's actually sweet.

1815
01:42:21,780 --> 01:42:23,160
It's like candy everywhere.

1816
01:42:23,820 --> 01:42:24,320
Candyland.

1817
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:26,520
Thank you guys for holding down the fort.

1818
01:42:26,700 --> 01:42:28,360
I kinda needed to go pee, I'm gonna be honest.

1819
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:30,260
We got you.

1820
01:42:30,660 --> 01:42:31,980
What degree do you have?

1821
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:32,700
In Minecraft.

1822
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:34,100
How did you know that I have a degree?

1823
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:36,340
Yeah, what kind of degree do you have?

1824
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:37,340
Yeah, what's your credential?

1825
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:40,600
My Minecraft credentials.

1826
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:42,880
To be a professional Minecrafter.

1827
01:42:42,980 --> 01:42:43,460
Your degree.

1828
01:42:44,820 --> 01:42:46,920
So, in reality...

1829
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:49,920
In real life, I have an engineering degree.

1830
01:42:50,420 --> 01:42:52,520
But, in Minecraft, I think that...

1831
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:53,940
That's how you calculate stuff.

1832
01:42:54,300 --> 01:42:57,040
Yeah, that's like a redstone degree or something maybe.

1833
01:42:57,200 --> 01:42:58,000
Something like that.

1834
01:42:58,080 --> 01:42:58,540
You know what I mean?

1835
01:42:58,540 --> 01:43:00,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1836
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:02,420
I'm trying to translate it to Minecraft.

1837
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:10,220
What did you want it to be before Minecraft ruined your life?

1838
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:11,440
Oh, no.

1839
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:13,180
You can say that.

1840
01:43:13,340 --> 01:43:15,000
You are 100% allowed to say that.

1841
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:17,780
I could've done anything, bro.

1842
01:43:17,940 --> 01:43:20,220
I have a whole ass degree and then I went...

1843
01:43:20,220 --> 01:43:22,180
Yeah, but Minecraft's really fun.

1844
01:43:22,380 --> 01:43:24,280
I could just do that all the time instead.

1845
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:25,660
That's true.

1846
01:43:25,660 --> 01:43:28,620
It's way more fun than having to do numbers and like...

1847
01:43:28,620 --> 01:43:30,160
Stupid stuff like that, dude.

1848
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:36,700
Oh, we're being told to explain some things for this match, I think.

1849
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:38,660
So, actually...

1850
01:43:38,660 --> 01:43:39,880
We mentioned before how...

1851
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:43,740
This is not like the first time they've done this tournament.

1852
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:46,840
And they have actually two new characters.

1853
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:50,160
And they want us to talk about...

1854
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:52,960
One of the characters is Harmony.

1855
01:43:54,260 --> 01:43:56,960
Harmony is being played by 5UPS.

1856
01:43:58,560 --> 01:43:59,220
And...

1857
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:02,400
She is a scout.

1858
01:44:03,060 --> 01:44:04,800
And she's 29 years old.

1859
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:06,000
She's probably single.

1860
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:07,250
And she probably likes...

1861
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:09,400
What are her likes and dislikes?

1862
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:10,380
What are her hobbies?

1863
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:13,120
She probably likes long walks on the beach.

1864
01:44:13,420 --> 01:44:16,020
I need the whole dating profile, please.

1865
01:44:16,260 --> 01:44:17,440
This is really important.

1866
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:21,920
Wait, she has a cat.

1867
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:23,540
She fights with her cat.

1868
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:25,580
Which way are we swiping?

1869
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:28,020
Oh my god, is Rattle playing?

1870
01:44:28,220 --> 01:44:29,800
Oh my god, yeah, Rattle is playing as Harmony.

1871
01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:30,480
This makes sense.

1872
01:44:30,920 --> 01:44:34,260
Yeah, you can see the cat on the head, the green cat.

1873
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:36,120
Oh my god, that's awesome.

1874
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:37,560
It's so cute!

1875
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:39,500
Is that the ult then?

1876
01:44:39,820 --> 01:44:42,180
Does the cat become huge?

1877
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:43,840
Wait, is that the cat?

1878
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:45,840
Oh my god, Roscoe!

1879
01:44:46,820 --> 01:44:47,340
Roscoe!

1880
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:48,700
That is so cute.

1881
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:50,280
Oh my god, that's so cute.

1882
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:51,760
So the cat hulks out then.

1883
01:44:52,660 --> 01:44:53,280
I see.

1884
01:44:54,420 --> 01:45:02,360
So Harmony and Roscoe are the newest character addition for this tournament.

1885
01:45:02,820 --> 01:45:04,960
Wait, who is the other character?

1886
01:45:06,660 --> 01:45:10,760
I don't think SirBlock is new per se.

1887
01:45:11,220 --> 01:45:12,220
At least I didn't say.

1888
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:16,300
But SmallAnt is playing as SirBlock.

1889
01:45:16,300 --> 01:45:20,380
That guy is a dapper man with a suit and tie.

1890
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:22,000
And he's got a green aura.

1891
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:26,220
Wait, SmallAnt's playing him, right?

1892
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:27,860
Yeah, you can see it.

1893
01:45:27,940 --> 01:45:29,600
Yeah, I see the green aura.

1894
01:45:30,220 --> 01:45:31,540
He's so dapper.

1895
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:37,240
I'll pay a Minecraft player $100 if they play Granny Hag.

1896
01:45:37,700 --> 01:45:39,800
Dude, we need Granny Hag.

1897
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:41,560
Where is Granny Hag?

1898
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:43,600
We need Slam Hag!

1899
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:46,680
Literally, she must be not meta, right?

1900
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:49,360
Wait, the devs might be watching right now.

1901
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:51,180
Give her 2x speed.

1902
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:53,980
Buffer right now.

1903
01:45:54,980 --> 01:45:56,040
Just don't tell anybody.

1904
01:45:56,360 --> 01:45:57,900
Only the real ones will know.

1905
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:01,880
Just for one game, buffer right now.

1906
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:04,240
They're fighting little candy zombies.

1907
01:46:04,540 --> 01:46:05,380
This is so cute.

1908
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:06,580
Oh wait, really?

1909
01:46:06,780 --> 01:46:07,760
Oh my god, they are.

1910
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:10,160
I like how the mobs are themed towards the maps too.

1911
01:46:10,740 --> 01:46:11,820
Got Feinberg coming in.

1912
01:46:11,820 --> 01:46:13,340
Wait, Reinho.

1913
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:15,620
Isn't she a VTuber?

1914
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:17,700
Reinho is a VTuber.

1915
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:20,220
Her name literally has VT at the end.

1916
01:46:20,220 --> 01:46:21,740
Oh yeah, VT is kind of a good hint.

1917
01:46:22,180 --> 01:46:23,120
Oh, you're right!

1918
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:28,680
I didn't see it.

1919
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:32,860
It stands for Virtual Tub or something.

1920
01:46:35,220 --> 01:46:37,040
I wasn't looking at the sides.

1921
01:46:37,120 --> 01:46:39,540
I was looking at her name above and I didn't see it.

1922
01:46:39,540 --> 01:46:42,000
No, for a minute it stands for Very Tubular.

1923
01:46:42,300 --> 01:46:43,500
Very Tubular.

1924
01:46:46,620 --> 01:46:48,480
That's what the VT stands for.

1925
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:48,700
Very Tubular.

1926
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:54,620
If you see somebody's name at the end that's VT, they're very cool.

1927
01:46:54,620 --> 01:46:55,600
Very Tubular.

1928
01:46:57,120 --> 01:46:58,380
Feinberg coming in.

1929
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:05,380
I like how they're alerted when someone is close to base because the withers just start going crazy.

1930
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:09,180
There's not really so many ways to sneak in.

1931
01:47:09,700 --> 01:47:11,520
There's a lot of hiding spots though.

1932
01:47:11,980 --> 01:47:12,660
Oh my god!

1933
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:14,420
Wait, Feinberg lost the 1v1.

1934
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:16,640
I think that's Feinberg right?

1935
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:18,440
Feinberg won the 1v1.

1936
01:47:19,720 --> 01:47:20,880
He's a little sneaky.

1937
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:22,820
You're right, there are a lot of hiding spots.

1938
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:25,320
Yeah, there's so many hiding spots here.

1939
01:47:25,900 --> 01:47:27,400
Smolot runs straight past!

1940
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:28,700
He has no idea!

1941
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:29,600
Oh my god!

1942
01:47:29,620 --> 01:47:30,520
He's gonna get ambushed!

1943
01:47:30,640 --> 01:47:31,800
Oh my god!

1944
01:47:32,420 --> 01:47:33,380
That's crazy!

1945
01:47:33,420 --> 01:47:34,600
Wow, he even died!

1946
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:36,000
That's crazy.

1947
01:47:36,260 --> 01:47:37,740
Did he live?

1948
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:40,620
Oh wait, he died.

1949
01:47:41,460 --> 01:47:43,660
But Silva's there to clean up the pieces.

1950
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:45,420
Wait, no, he lived.

1951
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,820
The red team won the fight.

1952
01:47:49,480 --> 01:47:52,740
Yeah, Silva came in from the side and was able to clean it up.

1953
01:47:53,860 --> 01:47:55,220
Nobody died during that.

1954
01:47:56,060 --> 01:47:56,940
On the other side.

1955
01:47:56,940 --> 01:48:01,540
This map is much bigger but also has a little canyon in the middle too.

1956
01:48:01,940 --> 01:48:02,720
Oh my god, it's a cake!

1957
01:48:03,380 --> 01:48:04,040
Oh wow!

1958
01:48:04,060 --> 01:48:04,640
Devil's food cake.

1959
01:48:06,020 --> 01:48:07,000
That is so cool.

1960
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:10,260
Wait, I just realized why we saw slime earlier.

1961
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:12,200
Because their textures were broken.

1962
01:48:14,240 --> 01:48:17,220
That's why we saw slime for pot of gold.

1963
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:22,100
We accidentally saw behind the Wizard of Oz's curtain.

1964
01:48:22,180 --> 01:48:23,120
We got walls.

1965
01:48:23,120 --> 01:48:24,280
Sorry everybody.

1966
01:48:24,720 --> 01:48:25,740
Your immersion.

1967
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:27,740
My immersion!

1968
01:48:27,940 --> 01:48:30,580
I was wondering why the slime was called pot of gold.

1969
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:33,180
Small ant running away.

1970
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:35,480
There he goes.

1971
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:36,120
Run!

1972
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:38,040
He's chasing you.

1973
01:48:38,180 --> 01:48:39,200
He's gonna get ya!

1974
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:41,800
This map is crazy.

1975
01:48:42,460 --> 01:48:44,600
This is why Bunny Boy is so overpowered here.

1976
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:47,340
Because if you're getting chased like this, you can just catch up.

1977
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:49,880
There's no way they can outrun you.

1978
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:52,680
I think Bunny Boy is really good for flanking too.

1979
01:48:52,680 --> 01:48:54,640
To get the main tower.

1980
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:57,180
He seems like...

1981
01:48:57,180 --> 01:48:59,920
It looks like every team has a similar sort of comp as well.

1982
01:49:00,140 --> 01:49:02,220
A lot of them have...

1983
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:02,880
One Harmony.

1984
01:49:03,580 --> 01:49:04,440
And one Surblock.

1985
01:49:04,700 --> 01:49:06,620
And then you've got the Bunny Guy.

1986
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:09,100
And the two Minotaurs.

1987
01:49:09,260 --> 01:49:09,740
I think.

1988
01:49:10,720 --> 01:49:12,720
I feel like...

1989
01:49:13,780 --> 01:49:15,500
Feinberg's team has to be the meta team.

1990
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:17,060
Because I've seen that comp the most.

1991
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:17,960
Yeah, for real.

1992
01:49:18,020 --> 01:49:19,700
It's very similar between the two.

1993
01:49:19,700 --> 01:49:22,520
It's just that Small Ant is using the Surblock.

1994
01:49:22,940 --> 01:49:23,780
And then on the other team...

1995
01:49:24,580 --> 01:49:26,380
Redoonz is using a different character.

1996
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:27,340
That I don't know if we've seen.

1997
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:28,580
That's not the Granny, right?

1998
01:49:28,980 --> 01:49:31,340
No, Granny is actually Slimey.

1999
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:34,240
Yeah, who's that character?

2000
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:35,840
That might be Axel.

2001
01:49:37,580 --> 01:49:38,280
Is that Axel?

2002
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:41,000
I think Axel is what Feinberg is.

2003
01:49:41,180 --> 01:49:41,780
Yeah, I was gonna say.

2004
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:43,620
I thought Axel was the Minotaur.

2005
01:49:44,140 --> 01:49:45,800
Let's see, I'm looking through the characters.

2006
01:49:46,220 --> 01:49:46,640
Oh wait!

2007
01:49:46,640 --> 01:49:48,540
No, I don't know.

2008
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:52,380
She has brown short hair.

2009
01:50:02,160 --> 01:50:03,460
I'm not sure.

2010
01:50:03,540 --> 01:50:07,020
We should ask our Minecraft analyst guy.

2011
01:50:07,220 --> 01:50:07,780
He should know.

2012
01:50:08,160 --> 01:50:10,280
I'm trying to find out.

2013
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:11,380
He should know.

2014
01:50:11,620 --> 01:50:15,320
Ask the professional Minecraft analysis guy who didn't fake his credentials.

2015
01:50:15,320 --> 01:50:17,640
He should know.

2016
01:50:17,640 --> 01:50:19,320
He has an actual degree in Redstone.

2017
01:50:20,820 --> 01:50:23,020
I have a degree from Gluck University.

2018
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:24,360
So he should know.

2019
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:27,200
So who is that character that they're playing?

2020
01:50:27,900 --> 01:50:28,760
I mean...

2021
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:29,740
Erm...

2022
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:31,400
Erm...

2023
01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:32,440
Erm...

2024
01:50:34,380 --> 01:50:34,980
Erm...

2025
01:50:34,980 --> 01:50:37,760
I think we should just make something up and then we'll agree.

2026
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:38,560
I feel like, yeah.

2027
01:50:39,700 --> 01:50:40,900
Is that...

2028
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:43,260
Okay, it might be Tulibar.

2029
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:45,700
Which is a cyborg.

2030
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:46,180
Is that a...

2031
01:50:46,180 --> 01:50:48,120
Is that a robotic glasses?

2032
01:50:48,740 --> 01:50:50,780
Wait, are you making stuff up or is that actually...

2033
01:50:50,780 --> 01:50:52,440
No, this is a guy.

2034
01:50:53,060 --> 01:50:56,400
No, it says robotic glasses covering eyes.

2035
01:50:56,720 --> 01:50:57,480
But it says eyes.

2036
01:50:57,900 --> 01:50:58,360
Is that a robotic...

2037
01:50:58,360 --> 01:50:59,060
Yeah, right?

2038
01:50:59,120 --> 01:51:00,440
There's only one eye covered there.

2039
01:51:00,740 --> 01:51:03,000
I feel like there's a couple of characters we haven't seen.

2040
01:51:03,220 --> 01:51:05,540
Like the great mage.

2041
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:06,640
I don't think we've seen him.

2042
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:09,860
Ooh, someone used an alt there.

2043
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:10,820
I didn't hear what that was.

2044
01:51:10,820 --> 01:51:11,700
An alt.

2045
01:51:13,020 --> 01:51:14,040
How the hell?

2046
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:15,280
Did you hear that?

2047
01:51:15,380 --> 01:51:16,320
He's like pew pew.

2048
01:51:21,260 --> 01:51:22,100
That's Rattles.

2049
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:22,820
That's my goat.

2050
01:51:23,180 --> 01:51:23,980
Let's go, Rad.

2051
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:28,100
It kind of makes sense as well.

2052
01:51:28,160 --> 01:51:30,800
Because her Vtuber model is a cat girl.

2053
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:33,180
And she's using the class which has the cat.

2054
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:34,340
Oh, the...

2055
01:51:34,340 --> 01:51:35,600
The cat girl is like a...

2056
01:51:35,600 --> 01:51:37,120
Yeah, right?

2057
01:51:37,120 --> 01:51:38,800
Well, that's so perfect though.

2058
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:39,520
I love that alt.

2059
01:51:39,700 --> 01:51:40,940
It's so funny.

2060
01:51:41,100 --> 01:51:41,540
I know.

2061
01:51:42,140 --> 01:51:43,440
Hulking out cats.

2062
01:51:44,820 --> 01:51:45,680
Hulking out.

2063
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:48,100
He's like, cootie smash.

2064
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:53,260
We need a reskin of it.

2065
01:51:53,380 --> 01:51:54,220
For you, Doki.

2066
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:55,600
And it's Garfield instead.

2067
01:51:56,720 --> 01:51:58,100
Oh my god, that's so great.

2068
01:51:58,260 --> 01:52:00,500
Garfield, Garfield smash.

2069
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:03,180
My money's gone.

2070
01:52:04,680 --> 01:52:05,480
Lasagna.

2071
01:52:06,040 --> 01:52:10,300
I don't know why he's becoming more like Arnold Schwarzenegger.

2072
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:15,680
Mondays in my brain.

2073
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:18,240
Lasagna.

2074
01:52:22,740 --> 01:52:26,440
It sounds like Garfield hates Mondays.

2075
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:31,360
The only kind of damage we have so far is...

2076
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:33,620
The red team has a tiny bit of damage.

2077
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:38,820
It seems like the first ten minutes are pretty...

2078
01:52:38,820 --> 01:52:39,560
It's just farming creeps.

2079
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:40,540
Pretty much, yeah.

2080
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:42,400
Yeah, I mean, that's what MOBAs are.

2081
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:43,640
It's just...

2082
01:52:43,640 --> 01:52:46,040
Oh, red are attacking right now though.

2083
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:48,540
Oh, there you go.

2084
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:49,820
Going in.

2085
01:52:50,300 --> 01:52:52,920
This is what I personally...

2086
01:52:53,940 --> 01:52:55,540
It's just the first ten minutes.

2087
01:52:55,660 --> 01:52:56,900
It's just farming creeps.

2088
01:52:57,460 --> 01:52:58,960
It feels like that for sure.

2089
01:52:58,960 --> 01:53:00,700
Yeah, I like it.

2090
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:03,720
But when you get to the action part, it's really fun.

2091
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:04,840
Oh, there he is!

2092
01:53:04,940 --> 01:53:05,300
There he goes!

2093
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:08,540
Oh my god, he's cute!

2094
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:15,380
Oh my god, he's so fast!

2095
01:53:18,700 --> 01:53:19,200
No!

2096
01:53:21,180 --> 01:53:21,680
Garfield!

2097
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:24,100
Garfield.

2098
01:53:24,500 --> 01:53:25,680
Ripped to a legend.

2099
01:53:25,680 --> 01:53:26,980
What's so great?

2100
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:29,940
What's so funny about Harmony is that each of the character profiles...

2101
01:53:29,940 --> 01:53:31,640
has like why they're playing the games.

2102
01:53:32,220 --> 01:53:33,860
And she plays for her cat.

2103
01:53:34,420 --> 01:53:35,760
She plays for...

2104
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:38,140
I feel like the cat just wants...

2105
01:53:38,140 --> 01:53:40,680
I think the cat is the one that wants to be in this game.

2106
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:41,520
For real, right?

2107
01:53:41,620 --> 01:53:41,880
Yeah.

2108
01:53:44,080 --> 01:53:45,040
So, Rascal...

2109
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:47,600
battles furiously to defend Harmony...

2110
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:50,520
always staying within a 16 block range of the player...

2111
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:52,400
until his HP energy runs out.

2112
01:53:52,500 --> 01:53:55,160
If Harmony dies whilst Rascal is mid ult...

2113
01:53:55,160 --> 01:53:57,000
he enters rage mode.

2114
01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:01,240
He goes rage mode when she's dead.

2115
01:54:01,620 --> 01:54:03,460
Yeah, but he has to be like in...

2116
01:54:03,460 --> 01:54:05,100
he has to be like...

2117
01:54:05,100 --> 01:54:06,600
kind of already mid ult.

2118
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:07,840
Already mid ult.

2119
01:54:09,700 --> 01:54:10,320
I love that.

2120
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:11,920
I love that.

2121
01:54:13,420 --> 01:54:14,660
Red are attacking again.

2122
01:54:14,780 --> 01:54:15,640
They put a tower down.

2123
01:54:16,140 --> 01:54:18,380
That was so fast!

2124
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:19,920
They're being a little more aggressive this time.

2125
01:54:20,380 --> 01:54:22,620
I think Red team might be better.

2126
01:54:22,620 --> 01:54:23,920
What is this?

2127
01:54:24,380 --> 01:54:24,980
Scrungle.

2128
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:28,560
Already 10 minutes in and they already got a tower?

2129
01:54:28,720 --> 01:54:29,360
That's crazy.

2130
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:32,660
I like this tiny view we got going on.

2131
01:54:33,060 --> 01:54:33,880
What was that?

2132
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:37,360
Oh yeah, the tiny POV there.

2133
01:54:38,300 --> 01:54:41,940
Is there any worth going into the crevice?

2134
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:43,060
I don't know.

2135
01:54:43,240 --> 01:54:45,480
It doesn't seem...

2136
01:54:45,480 --> 01:54:46,440
That's what I'm thinking.

2137
01:54:46,740 --> 01:54:49,560
Is the crater the second map that we had?

2138
01:54:49,560 --> 01:54:51,300
Nah, it doesn't seem to be the case.

2139
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:53,640
I think it looks like...

2140
01:54:53,640 --> 01:54:54,640
You should just do a jump and see.

2141
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,380
It's like Willy Wonka down there.

2142
01:54:56,440 --> 01:54:58,440
You die in the chocolate...

2143
01:54:58,440 --> 01:54:59,320
sauce.

2144
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:03,780
This is the chocolate factory.

2145
01:55:04,220 --> 01:55:04,480
Yeah.

2146
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:09,900
I mean Blue have done some damage on the Red withers.

2147
01:55:10,100 --> 01:55:12,400
But not very much.

2148
01:55:12,500 --> 01:55:13,100
I'm gonna be honest.

2149
01:55:13,220 --> 01:55:15,840
I feel like Red are kind of overpowered here.

2150
01:55:16,060 --> 01:55:17,900
Feinberg takes out two.

2151
01:55:17,900 --> 01:55:19,340
Oh my god, yeah.

2152
01:55:19,480 --> 01:55:21,820
They just killed so many people.

2153
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:27,560
But to be fair, the Blue team lost three there.

2154
01:55:28,460 --> 01:55:30,500
So they're like even pretty much.

2155
01:55:30,940 --> 01:55:31,780
You know what I want to see?

2156
01:55:32,020 --> 01:55:34,540
I want to see Willy Wonka do a battle royale with children.

2157
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:38,760
Is that not just the regular plot of the movie?

2158
01:55:42,060 --> 01:55:43,780
But they don't...

2159
01:55:43,780 --> 01:55:45,260
They don't die.

2160
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:48,760
Well, hey, you don't know where they go, right?

2161
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:51,440
One of them turns into a blueberry.

2162
01:55:52,540 --> 01:55:53,980
Yeah, but she's still alive.

2163
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,580
She has to live her life in the factory like as a blueberry.

2164
01:55:56,860 --> 01:55:59,040
What kind of life is that?

2165
01:56:00,180 --> 01:56:02,380
It's basically death sentence.

2166
01:56:05,200 --> 01:56:09,040
I don't even know what I can say actually.

2167
01:56:10,900 --> 01:56:13,660
We've used our two slip-ups already.

2168
01:56:13,660 --> 01:56:16,880
You can say it on the Minecraft podcast where I'm sponsy.

2169
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:21,100
Oh my god, Red are pushing.

2170
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:22,300
And they have their ults.

2171
01:56:22,900 --> 01:56:23,800
There's four.

2172
01:56:26,580 --> 01:56:28,400
Fineberg's just written this crystal out.

2173
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:33,960
Crystal down.

2174
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:43,300
I'm surprised they haven't used their ults yet.

2175
01:56:43,380 --> 01:56:44,640
Yeah, they haven't used any of their ults.

2176
01:56:45,620 --> 01:56:47,120
Silver has it as well.

2177
01:56:47,980 --> 01:56:50,380
Oh my god.

2178
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:51,660
That's crazy.

2179
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:54,880
Red team did lose a tower.

2180
01:56:57,220 --> 01:56:58,480
Yeah, I think...

2181
01:57:00,140 --> 01:57:01,800
Someone's attacking Red as well.

2182
01:57:01,900 --> 01:57:02,100
Yeah.

2183
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:04,460
Someone on Blue team is attacking them right now.

2184
01:57:04,460 --> 01:57:05,340
Or they were.

2185
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:11,800
Dude, Silver's going crazy on these kills right now, but finally they got enough respawns.

2186
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,360
Oh my god, they only have one crystal left.

2187
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:14,200
Yeah, Fineberg got a crystal down.

2188
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:17,280
He can't take the 1v3.

2189
01:57:17,740 --> 01:57:19,260
He cannot take that 1v3.

2190
01:57:20,500 --> 01:57:24,060
They're doing a counter-attack, but they just need one person to sneak in.

2191
01:57:24,220 --> 01:57:24,740
That's it.

2192
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:29,380
What is Axel's...

2193
01:57:32,460 --> 01:57:32,860
Fineberg's...

2194
01:57:33,260 --> 01:57:34,660
They have three ults.

2195
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:35,880
Red team has three ults.

2196
01:57:36,060 --> 01:57:37,480
Dude, I'm surprised they didn't use them.

2197
01:57:37,480 --> 01:57:38,940
I know that Smallland used his.

2198
01:57:39,160 --> 01:57:41,280
I think they want to use it for the dragons.

2199
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:48,000
What's crazy, each character even has their own passive, so that's probably why the meta is like, you know, this kind of build.

2200
01:57:49,940 --> 01:57:51,480
The ults for...

2201
01:57:52,820 --> 01:57:54,040
Axel, the Minotaur guy.

2202
01:57:54,040 --> 01:57:55,000
Click on below!

2203
01:57:57,200 --> 01:57:58,440
Oh, two of them used it.

2204
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:03,040
Oh, it like locks people in.

2205
01:58:03,220 --> 01:58:05,420
Yeah, it stuns them, I think.

2206
01:58:05,420 --> 01:58:07,160
I've been waiting to do this.

2207
01:58:07,220 --> 01:58:08,200
It makes them faster.

2208
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:10,280
Fineberg used his ult.

2209
01:58:11,100 --> 01:58:14,160
It makes them land attacks more quickly.

2210
01:58:14,980 --> 01:58:16,240
Oh, yeah, they died.

2211
01:58:17,980 --> 01:58:20,000
Rascal is goating up right now.

2212
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:21,340
No, Rascal!

2213
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:25,100
Someone from the blue team just fell.

2214
01:58:25,580 --> 01:58:26,620
Oh my god, the dragons!

2215
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:27,920
The crystals are down!

2216
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:28,980
It's just the dragon!

2217
01:58:29,380 --> 01:58:30,260
It's just the dragon!

2218
01:58:31,640 --> 01:58:33,120
It's another one guy!

2219
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:35,100
He's chasing him!

2220
01:58:37,140 --> 01:58:38,820
Are we going to see a flank from blue team?

2221
01:58:39,140 --> 01:58:40,720
Or are red team going to take this down?

2222
01:58:41,140 --> 01:58:49,640
Oh wait, they just need to use the Rascal ult and then like just run to the dragon and get into rage mode.

2223
01:58:49,820 --> 01:58:55,380
And Rad's at 95% on the Rascal ult right now, so definitely could do, maybe in a few seconds.

2224
01:58:56,200 --> 01:58:57,240
But she might die here.

2225
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:57,780
She's dead.

2226
01:58:58,720 --> 01:59:00,180
We've got to see her respawn first.

2227
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:01,120
Oh, but here it goes!

2228
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:01,880
Here it goes!

2229
01:59:02,700 --> 01:59:03,880
And there it is.

2230
01:59:03,940 --> 01:59:04,340
Wow.

2231
01:59:04,720 --> 01:59:05,900
Wow, that was fast.

2232
01:59:06,200 --> 01:59:10,840
That was a super quick game, yeah.

2233
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:11,660
15 minutes.

2234
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:18,180
I think SmallAnt's team is like really overpowered compared to the other team.

2235
01:59:20,380 --> 01:59:21,500
That's crazy.

2236
01:59:21,820 --> 01:59:27,240
That might actually be our first win of the entire round out of all the teams that are going against each other.

2237
01:59:27,240 --> 01:59:30,420
I think it was.

2238
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:33,800
I think it was the fastest match out of the like 4 matches we have going on.

2239
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:34,100
I think so, yeah.

2240
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:37,100
That was so fast.

2241
01:59:37,260 --> 01:59:37,800
That was fast.

2242
01:59:39,100 --> 01:59:43,000
They like took like 3 towers down within like 10 minutes and everything.

2243
01:59:50,240 --> 01:59:52,840
The highlights, our little recap reel.

2244
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:56,360
Watching him go...

2245
01:59:56,360 --> 01:59:57,780
Hulk mode.

2246
01:59:57,780 --> 01:59:58,060
Hulk mode.

2247
02:00:00,580 --> 02:00:04,360
I love that the cat turns into a huge...

2248
02:00:04,360 --> 02:00:10,120
a huge like rage cat that just tries to defeat everything.

2249
02:00:10,360 --> 02:00:10,900
I love that.

2250
02:00:11,240 --> 02:00:13,100
The rage cat has to defeat Hulk.

2251
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:17,420
He's like times 3 bigger than everybody else too.

2252
02:00:17,780 --> 02:00:19,820
He can see him from so far.

2253
02:00:20,420 --> 02:00:22,320
He's just like, I'm angry.

2254
02:00:22,320 --> 02:00:22,400
I'm angry.

2255
02:00:26,090 --> 02:00:27,060
Goodbye smiling.

2256
02:00:30,460 --> 02:00:32,680
And the win.

2257
02:00:33,200 --> 02:00:33,860
Yeah baby.

2258
02:00:35,980 --> 02:00:37,340
Here it is.

2259
02:00:37,460 --> 02:00:37,900
Victory!

2260
02:00:42,100 --> 02:00:44,820
That was some intense games.

2261
02:00:45,080 --> 02:00:45,740
We do have another.

2262
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:52,800
Team BTMC actually won against Team Shubble.

2263
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:55,200
Shubble?

2264
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:55,800
Shubble?

2265
02:00:56,800 --> 02:00:57,400
Shubble?

2266
02:00:57,680 --> 02:00:58,140
Shubble?

2267
02:00:59,540 --> 02:01:00,620
Where do you see that?

2268
02:01:01,020 --> 02:01:02,080
Oh, I see it.

2269
02:01:07,120 --> 02:01:08,740
Guys, I am professional.

2270
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:11,140
Yeah.

2271
02:01:12,040 --> 02:01:13,280
Yeah, professional.

2272
02:01:14,460 --> 02:01:15,380
Wait, that means...

2273
02:01:15,380 --> 02:01:16,900
Wait, their game must be really fast too.

2274
02:01:17,720 --> 02:01:19,100
Dude, that was fast.

2275
02:01:19,340 --> 02:01:20,080
That was pretty fast.

2276
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:22,160
Did they finish theirs before us?

2277
02:01:22,660 --> 02:01:23,540
No, no, we finished.

2278
02:01:23,580 --> 02:01:24,480
It was pretty close.

2279
02:01:24,780 --> 02:01:26,040
It was really close though, yeah.

2280
02:01:27,020 --> 02:01:31,440
Oh, so I heard that Fulham has something to say to us.

2281
02:01:31,640 --> 02:01:32,200
Oh, cool.

2282
02:01:32,500 --> 02:01:41,540
I think I'm meant to say a big, huge thank you to H&R Block for making awesome things happen in gaming.

2283
02:01:42,620 --> 02:01:51,020
You guys should make sure to go check out Luna the client and check out the free HRB cosmetics because with HRB Block, it is better with Block.

2284
02:01:51,140 --> 02:01:51,980
That's all I have to say.

2285
02:01:52,340 --> 02:01:55,540
Now, I'm so grateful that you guys were dancing and jumping around during that.

2286
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:58,020
That was super, super helpful.

2287
02:02:00,660 --> 02:02:03,200
Yes, thank you for...

2288
02:02:03,200 --> 02:02:04,440
I was like, skipper, skipper.

2289
02:02:05,940 --> 02:02:08,100
Hey, shout out to those guys, but we're done now.

2290
02:02:08,160 --> 02:02:08,540
It's okay.

2291
02:02:08,620 --> 02:02:09,540
Hey, we're back.

2292
02:02:09,600 --> 02:02:09,920
We're back.

2293
02:02:09,960 --> 02:02:10,380
We're back.

2294
02:02:10,540 --> 02:02:10,720
We're back.

2295
02:02:10,720 --> 02:02:11,720
I'm ready to talk about the MOBA.

2296
02:02:12,060 --> 02:02:12,060
We're back.

2297
02:02:12,060 --> 02:02:12,920
We're back, guys.

2298
02:02:12,920 --> 02:02:13,480
We're back.

2299
02:02:13,540 --> 02:02:14,900
No skipper, skipper.

2300
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:20,400
Yeah, we wouldn't be able to have the tournament without it, guys.

2301
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:20,980
Without it.

2302
02:02:21,260 --> 02:02:22,360
Guys, go check them out.

2303
02:02:22,460 --> 02:02:25,100
Do exclamation point Lunar in either of our chats.

2304
02:02:25,400 --> 02:02:25,400
Yeah.

2305
02:02:26,080 --> 02:02:28,500
More details about our wonderful sponsor.

2306
02:02:29,660 --> 02:02:33,600
Yeah, you can go to the link and get the little cosmetic.

2307
02:02:34,340 --> 02:02:35,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2308
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:35,920
Oh, yeah.

2309
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:41,800
Min was telling me how she was setting up her bot for the first time for the stream and was not having a good time.

2310
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:46,920
I started streaming and immediately started banning everybody else.

2311
02:02:49,160 --> 02:02:51,060
Why was I banning?

2312
02:02:51,180 --> 02:02:52,740
What did you do?

2313
02:02:52,820 --> 02:02:55,220
Because it was just like people are spamming emotes.

2314
02:02:55,420 --> 02:02:59,860
It was like, if you post more than three emotes, I'm gonna ban you.

2315
02:03:00,160 --> 02:03:02,020
It was like ten people at once.

2316
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:03,360
It was crazy.

2317
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:03,420
It was crazy.

2318
02:03:09,060 --> 02:03:12,400
Nightbot is only here for the Lunar skin.

2319
02:03:13,240 --> 02:03:13,780
Cosmetic.

2320
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:14,860
Lunar cosmetic.

2321
02:03:16,280 --> 02:03:17,220
That's funny.

2322
02:03:18,040 --> 02:03:20,080
They're like, how dare you spam.

2323
02:03:20,480 --> 02:03:21,400
It's okay, guys.

2324
02:03:21,720 --> 02:03:22,720
You can... Oh, wait, no.

2325
02:03:23,440 --> 02:03:23,960
Oh, wait.

2326
02:03:24,100 --> 02:03:29,360
You can do it on my... You can't do it on my YouTube, but you can spam emotes on my Twitch channel.

2327
02:03:31,780 --> 02:03:33,280
Dude, bots can be like that.

2328
02:03:33,320 --> 02:03:34,880
Especially when you first set them up.

2329
02:03:34,980 --> 02:03:36,180
It's like, uh-oh, nope.

2330
02:03:36,520 --> 02:03:37,580
Something's going wrong here.

2331
02:03:37,780 --> 02:03:41,480
Someone's being rude and too many exclamation marks.

2332
02:03:41,620 --> 02:03:41,980
Like, come on.

2333
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:43,020
Relax, man.

2334
02:03:43,240 --> 02:03:43,920
It's okay.

2335
02:03:44,420 --> 02:03:45,280
It's so sensitive.

2336
02:03:46,340 --> 02:03:48,120
Hey, it's okay to be sensitive sometimes.

2337
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:49,900
It has to for those who don't have mods.

2338
02:03:50,120 --> 02:03:50,360
Right.

2339
02:03:51,400 --> 02:03:52,900
Self-moderate and stuff.

2340
02:03:54,120 --> 02:04:00,020
So it has to be super sensitive because one wrong move makes it goodbye channel.

2341
02:04:00,420 --> 02:04:01,840
Yeah, I know.

2342
02:04:03,020 --> 02:04:06,280
Well, we are in the final two rounds.

2343
02:04:06,500 --> 02:04:09,020
It's semifinals next, guys.

2344
02:04:09,640 --> 02:04:11,160
Oh my gosh, we're already at the...

2345
02:04:11,740 --> 02:04:13,180
We're already at the semis.

2346
02:04:14,120 --> 02:04:14,980
I know, we're zooming.

2347
02:04:16,460 --> 02:04:18,100
Yeah, who's in the semifinals?

2348
02:04:18,400 --> 02:04:20,000
Like, who are the matchups for the semifinals?

2349
02:04:20,020 --> 02:04:29,000
I guess, I mean, we're still waiting on some of the outcomes of the games, but I think that given the fact that we saw Team Small Ant win two games, that's big.

2350
02:04:29,240 --> 02:04:35,860
And I've literally just heard my friend scream from next door, so I think they might have just won.

2351
02:04:36,860 --> 02:04:39,120
So Sparkle's won against Sniffer, then.

2352
02:04:39,200 --> 02:04:40,080
I believe so.

2353
02:04:40,300 --> 02:04:42,420
I can see it in the game's log.

2354
02:04:44,620 --> 02:04:47,000
Actually, well, yeah, so we have...

2355
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:52,300
I think Hannah has won... Well, we just need to know if Hannah wins her game.

2356
02:04:52,580 --> 02:04:54,600
Yeah, because that would be three wins for Hannah.

2357
02:04:55,200 --> 02:05:00,000
Yeah, because if Hannah would have won all her games, I believe Small Ant won all his games, too, right?

2358
02:05:00,300 --> 02:05:01,440
Yeah, so it might be...

2359
02:05:02,220 --> 02:05:14,920
I mean, this is not gospel, this is not confirmed, but I'm going to assume that it sounds like it might be Team Sparkle's versus Small Ant, and then I think it might be Team Hannah versus Five Up?

2360
02:05:15,220 --> 02:05:16,960
I'm not sure on that second matchup.

2361
02:05:17,140 --> 02:05:19,060
It's, you know, I'm not 100%...

2362
02:05:19,060 --> 02:05:23,000
I think it's Sparkle's, Hannah and Small Ant are definitely in the semis.

2363
02:05:23,980 --> 02:05:24,980
Wait, how many...

2364
02:05:24,980 --> 02:05:25,880
Is it like...

2365
02:05:25,880 --> 02:05:29,000
Do all groups qualify for semifinals?

2366
02:05:30,080 --> 02:05:30,380
Yeah, so...

2367
02:05:30,380 --> 02:05:34,640
I think this is where it splits off into two different brackets where...

2368
02:05:34,640 --> 02:05:36,100
Yeah, so that's why I was like, what is it?

2369
02:05:36,180 --> 02:05:38,040
Loser bracket or winner's bracket?

2370
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:38,400
Yeah, exactly.

2371
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:44,640
I think they call it a consolation bracket, because I think loser sounds rude, right?

2372
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:47,080
You're so mean, don't be mean.

2373
02:05:47,420 --> 02:05:48,320
Everyone's a winner.

2374
02:05:48,320 --> 02:05:50,820
I'm sorry, I'm not here to pamper people.

2375
02:05:51,200 --> 02:05:51,840
No, you're fine.

2376
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:53,540
I call it a loser bracket.

2377
02:05:54,060 --> 02:05:56,760
We all have to accept it as I grow up.

2378
02:05:57,320 --> 02:05:58,560
King of the loser.

2379
02:06:02,740 --> 02:06:05,280
Hey, we're sensitive Minecraft players.

2380
02:06:05,540 --> 02:06:07,780
We can't be called losers, okay?

2381
02:06:08,020 --> 02:06:08,940
Hey, be nice.

2382
02:06:10,060 --> 02:06:11,260
We're runners-up.

2383
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:13,380
We're consolation brackets, you know what I mean?

2384
02:06:13,780 --> 02:06:16,520
Don't say the L word here, Tokyo.

2385
02:06:16,520 --> 02:06:18,340
I'm sorry, I've lost.

2386
02:06:18,640 --> 02:06:21,020
I've been a loser before in tournaments.

2387
02:06:21,320 --> 02:06:22,840
I just thought it'd be the same.

2388
02:06:24,240 --> 02:06:26,020
Hey, it's okay to be a loser.

2389
02:06:27,660 --> 02:06:28,140
It's...

2390
02:06:29,460 --> 02:06:32,060
Wait, so are the semis going at the same...

2391
02:06:32,060 --> 02:06:34,460
The consolation bracket and...

2392
02:06:34,460 --> 02:06:36,740
Yeah, they're both happening at the same time, right?

2393
02:06:36,820 --> 02:06:38,060
They're going at the same time, okay.

2394
02:06:38,360 --> 02:06:43,540
I think we're going to be focusing on whoever is in the winner's bracket though, you know what I mean?

2395
02:06:43,560 --> 02:06:45,920
I feel like that's maybe more important.

2396
02:06:46,840 --> 02:06:52,040
But this pretty much determines whether these teams are going to be finishing in the top four or the bottom four.

2397
02:06:52,400 --> 02:07:00,320
Because that's now all done from the group stages, but from now on, it all depends on whether they're going to win these bracket match-ups.

2398
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:09,400
So, once we go through these semi-finals, the last match will be... We'll watch the finals, but there's also going to be a third-place match, I think, running at the same time.

2399
02:07:09,800 --> 02:07:12,560
I'm going to check what the behind-the-scenes are saying.

2400
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:18,680
But, yeah, I think that seems to be usually what the run of play is.

2401
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:25,240
And I think we're just waiting on that final game to see who's playing who in this finale.

2402
02:07:25,600 --> 02:07:28,740
Oh, I think we just got it in.

2403
02:07:29,260 --> 02:07:30,200
There it is.

2404
02:07:30,340 --> 02:07:32,200
Team Hanna gets their third win!

2405
02:07:32,820 --> 02:07:33,300
There it is.

2406
02:07:33,560 --> 02:07:39,240
So, it is Smallant, Hanna, and Sparklez.

2407
02:07:39,780 --> 02:07:40,660
I think so.

2408
02:07:40,660 --> 02:07:46,820
And then, I'm not sure who that fourth team is, but I think... Because I know there's some tie-breakers and things like that.

2409
02:07:46,940 --> 02:07:51,860
I'm not... Now, as much as I'm the quote-unquote pro, I don't know everything about it.

2410
02:07:51,920 --> 02:07:53,280
I need to do some research.

2411
02:07:53,700 --> 02:07:54,720
Someone's gonna...

2412
02:07:54,720 --> 02:07:57,820
Someone will tell me in my ear in a little minute and say, hey, these are the match-ups.

2413
02:07:57,960 --> 02:07:59,500
So, we'll find that out very soon.

2414
02:07:59,580 --> 02:07:59,900
Okay.

2415
02:08:00,320 --> 02:08:01,200
Soon, soon.

2416
02:08:02,380 --> 02:08:06,040
I think they're also trying to... They're asking me to do something, too.

2417
02:08:06,160 --> 02:08:07,720
And I'm like, how do I do that?

2418
02:08:07,720 --> 02:08:10,420
Oh, she's buffering.

2419
02:08:10,520 --> 02:08:11,660
Everybody, please hold.

2420
02:08:12,520 --> 02:08:13,360
Guys, please hold.

2421
02:08:13,560 --> 02:08:16,080
I'm trying to figure out this thing that they're trying to tell me to do.

2422
02:08:16,240 --> 02:08:18,080
And I'm like, but how?

2423
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:23,060
I don't know when I did that.

2424
02:08:23,220 --> 02:08:23,640
That's when...

2425
02:08:23,640 --> 02:08:24,720
My before times.

2426
02:08:28,140 --> 02:08:28,960
Buffer, buffer.

2427
02:08:29,860 --> 02:08:31,120
My before four times.

2428
02:08:31,120 --> 02:08:31,700
Buffer, buffer.

2429
02:08:33,020 --> 02:08:34,460
Oh my god.

2430
02:08:35,220 --> 02:08:36,120
Guys, please hold.

2431
02:08:36,500 --> 02:08:39,200
I'm buffering right now because I'm trying to figure this out.

2432
02:08:39,880 --> 02:08:41,820
I think they're helping you.

2433
02:08:42,500 --> 02:08:43,240
Oh my god.

2434
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:43,660
Okay.

2435
02:08:45,340 --> 02:08:46,400
I might be wrong.

2436
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:49,140
I've tried to give you a suggestion but it might not even be correct, dude.

2437
02:08:50,700 --> 02:08:51,220
Okay.

2438
02:08:51,560 --> 02:08:51,940
Alright.

2439
02:08:52,720 --> 02:08:55,780
Is this our fourth map?

2440
02:08:55,940 --> 02:08:57,860
Is this Goldmire Gulch?

2441
02:08:59,420 --> 02:08:59,940
Goldmire...

2442
02:08:59,940 --> 02:09:00,300
Oh!

2443
02:09:01,380 --> 02:09:02,420
Goldmire Gulch.

2444
02:09:03,560 --> 02:09:05,800
It looks like the first city we were at.

2445
02:09:06,640 --> 02:09:07,440
Just sunset.

2446
02:09:07,940 --> 02:09:08,400
Is it?

2447
02:09:08,720 --> 02:09:09,820
Oh, it does, sort of.

2448
02:09:09,860 --> 02:09:10,120
Yeah.

2449
02:09:12,280 --> 02:09:13,680
I think we're just chilling.

2450
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:17,900
I think 5UP is going to find out whether they've made it to the top bracket or the bottom bracket.

2451
02:09:17,900 --> 02:09:19,020
Oh, maybe that's the lobby.

2452
02:09:19,660 --> 02:09:19,820
I'm not sure.

2453
02:09:19,820 --> 02:09:20,560
Maybe that's the lobby.

2454
02:09:20,560 --> 02:09:21,200
Maybe this is the lobby.

2455
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:23,760
Hi, 5UP.

2456
02:09:25,300 --> 02:09:26,180
You go do your thing.

2457
02:09:27,080 --> 02:09:27,980
I believe in you.

2458
02:09:28,860 --> 02:09:29,420
They're exploring.

2459
02:09:29,560 --> 02:09:31,280
They're giving us a little tour of the city.

2460
02:09:31,560 --> 02:09:31,980
Yeah.

2461
02:09:32,240 --> 02:09:34,360
They're giving us a little tour while I figure this out.

2462
02:09:34,620 --> 02:09:34,880
Yeah.

2463
02:09:36,700 --> 02:09:40,980
Oh my gosh, it's so cute.

2464
02:09:50,740 --> 02:09:55,160
Alright, you go carry the casting real quick while I figure out settings.

2465
02:09:55,460 --> 02:09:55,600
Me?

2466
02:09:56,080 --> 02:09:56,300
Okay.

2467
02:09:58,140 --> 02:10:01,140
Okay, Fulham, I'm gonna question you.

2468
02:10:01,680 --> 02:10:03,420
Oh god, am I gonna get interviewed live?

2469
02:10:03,540 --> 02:10:04,120
This is scary.

2470
02:10:04,240 --> 02:10:05,180
I haven't prepared my answers.

2471
02:10:05,560 --> 02:10:05,740
Help.

2472
02:10:09,660 --> 02:10:12,180
What's your favorite Minecraft mob?

2473
02:10:14,200 --> 02:10:15,860
That's a really good question.

2474
02:10:16,520 --> 02:10:17,320
Don't lie.

2475
02:10:18,340 --> 02:10:20,380
No, I have to think about it, you know what I mean?

2476
02:10:22,380 --> 02:10:23,320
Okay, right.

2477
02:10:23,820 --> 02:10:26,980
I like... Oh dude, they all kind of suck.

2478
02:10:27,080 --> 02:10:28,200
Like, I don't like any of them.

2479
02:10:29,220 --> 02:10:29,240
Whoa!

2480
02:10:30,420 --> 02:10:31,760
Live on stream?

2481
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:32,800
Dude, what?

2482
02:10:32,940 --> 02:10:34,520
Like, I can't say skeleton.

2483
02:10:34,820 --> 02:10:36,000
Skeletons are so annoying.

2484
02:10:36,620 --> 02:10:38,740
Do you think Enderman is sexy?

2485
02:10:39,900 --> 02:10:41,360
Oh, okay, which mob would you date?

2486
02:10:41,360 --> 02:10:42,720
Am I allowed to speak about this?

2487
02:10:43,200 --> 02:10:43,880
On stream?

2488
02:10:44,160 --> 02:10:46,860
Yeah, which PG-13, which mob would you date?

2489
02:10:47,080 --> 02:10:48,320
Oh, definitely Wither Skeleton.

2490
02:10:49,040 --> 02:10:50,160
Wither Skeleton?

2491
02:10:50,820 --> 02:10:52,060
Why the Wither?

2492
02:10:52,680 --> 02:10:53,700
They're crazy tall.

2493
02:10:53,940 --> 02:10:54,120
Hello?

2494
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:55,280
Hello?

2495
02:10:55,860 --> 02:10:58,360
Like, three blocks tall?

2496
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:01,220
Three blocks tall?

2497
02:11:01,700 --> 02:11:02,100
Skinny?

2498
02:11:02,460 --> 02:11:03,840
Like, damn, okay.

2499
02:11:04,060 --> 02:11:05,700
Okay, I didn't know you were built like that.

2500
02:11:06,360 --> 02:11:09,820
But, then where does the Enderman fall into this case?

2501
02:11:09,960 --> 02:11:12,340
I mean, that guy is tall, dark, and handsome.

2502
02:11:13,080 --> 02:11:15,260
Yeah, but they can teleport, and that freaks me out.

2503
02:11:15,500 --> 02:11:18,020
I think that's like a little bit, uh...

2504
02:11:18,620 --> 02:11:19,240
You know what I mean?

2505
02:11:19,380 --> 02:11:22,360
Like, look, at least the Wither Skeleton is there.

2506
02:11:22,820 --> 02:11:28,000
They've got a similar build, but, um, you know, one of them can teleport, and one of them can't.

2507
02:11:28,080 --> 02:11:28,520
You know what I mean?

2508
02:11:28,840 --> 02:11:30,660
And you can't look at Enderman in the eyes.

2509
02:11:30,860 --> 02:11:33,300
That's something that you learn on day one.

2510
02:11:33,300 --> 02:11:34,000
So you're afraid of commitment?

2511
02:11:38,400 --> 02:11:39,460
Oh, you're right.

2512
02:11:39,560 --> 02:11:40,800
Sorry, I just registered that.

2513
02:11:43,740 --> 02:11:45,020
It's just that they can't.

2514
02:11:45,600 --> 02:11:48,000
Okay, what is, um...

2515
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:52,660
Okay, so what is your first thing you do when you are speedrunning on Minecraft?

2516
02:11:54,120 --> 02:11:54,920
Punch a tree.

2517
02:11:55,620 --> 02:11:57,240
Oh, that makes so much sense.

2518
02:11:57,340 --> 02:11:59,160
It's just like a real Minecraft playthrough.

2519
02:11:59,360 --> 02:12:00,220
It's like your Let's Play.

2520
02:12:00,420 --> 02:12:01,820
It's like, yep, you gotta punch a tree.

2521
02:12:02,560 --> 02:12:03,360
It's pretty universal.

2522
02:12:03,600 --> 02:12:03,920
I love that.

2523
02:12:04,280 --> 02:12:04,620
Oh, wow.

2524
02:12:04,920 --> 02:12:06,260
Wait, man, what's your type, then?

2525
02:12:06,660 --> 02:12:07,320
What's your Minecraft type?

2526
02:12:07,320 --> 02:12:08,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2527
02:12:08,280 --> 02:12:09,520
Spin the question, huh?

2528
02:12:09,700 --> 02:12:10,680
I think it's obvious.

2529
02:12:10,860 --> 02:12:11,160
Enderman.

2530
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,580
Okay, but what makes the Enderman your type?

2531
02:12:16,200 --> 02:12:20,640
I kinda like that he teleports, because it's like, I never know what's gonna happen.

2532
02:12:20,940 --> 02:12:22,680
It's gonna come up behind me, you know?

2533
02:12:25,460 --> 02:12:26,500
Damn, Freaky!

2534
02:12:36,710 --> 02:12:38,190
What about you, Doki?

2535
02:12:38,430 --> 02:12:38,730
Come on.

2536
02:12:39,410 --> 02:12:39,750
Me?

2537
02:12:39,930 --> 02:12:42,090
I don't play Minecraft enough to... Oh, come on.

2538
02:12:42,130 --> 02:12:42,610
Shut up.

2539
02:12:42,950 --> 02:12:44,110
Shut up.

2540
02:12:44,110 --> 02:12:45,530
Trying to dodge the question.

2541
02:12:47,010 --> 02:12:49,190
We're all airing our dirty laundry here.

2542
02:12:49,270 --> 02:12:49,610
Come on.

2543
02:12:52,790 --> 02:12:53,930
Wait, wait, wait.

2544
02:12:54,270 --> 02:12:55,630
What are the mods again?

2545
02:12:55,830 --> 02:13:01,370
They're gonna kick me out of Minecraft University because of this stream, so you better at least answer the question, you know what I mean?

2546
02:13:01,450 --> 02:13:01,990
Because of this stream?

2547
02:13:02,070 --> 02:13:04,390
Just because they're like, whoa, with their skeleton.

2548
02:13:04,570 --> 02:13:05,190
Yeah, right?

2549
02:13:07,070 --> 02:13:11,610
Then what's the right answer then, that would get you approved in Minecraft University?

2550
02:13:12,270 --> 02:13:15,190
Dude, you have to be like, no one.

2551
02:13:15,270 --> 02:13:17,230
Oh, I love the Minecraft too much.

2552
02:13:17,370 --> 02:13:17,750
Like, no.

2553
02:13:18,210 --> 02:13:19,910
What a boring answer, you know what I mean?

2554
02:13:19,910 --> 02:13:21,250
Dirt block.

2555
02:13:21,750 --> 02:13:27,690
Oh, you're just too pure to date anybody in Minecraft mods.

2556
02:13:29,170 --> 02:13:32,050
Okay, I feel like for you, it would be an iron golem.

2557
02:13:32,730 --> 02:13:34,110
Why the iron golem?

2558
02:13:34,350 --> 02:13:36,190
It's the closest to a robot.

2559
02:13:37,630 --> 02:13:39,690
It's the closest to a transformer.

2560
02:13:40,730 --> 02:13:42,010
That's crazy.

2561
02:13:43,550 --> 02:13:44,570
Okay, look.

2562
02:13:45,610 --> 02:13:54,050
I just think certain transformers are made, designed to be pretty wild.

2563
02:13:54,370 --> 02:13:55,390
I'm trying to be PG.

2564
02:13:56,030 --> 02:13:58,650
Hey, I think iron golems are tall.

2565
02:13:59,290 --> 02:14:01,350
They deal a lot of damage if you're into that.

2566
02:14:01,550 --> 02:14:02,390
I don't know.

2567
02:14:03,410 --> 02:14:06,370
They can carry me.

2568
02:14:07,750 --> 02:14:10,210
And if you're nice to them, they give you flowers.

2569
02:14:11,230 --> 02:14:11,770
That's real.

2570
02:14:11,930 --> 02:14:12,850
That's in the game.

2571
02:14:14,090 --> 02:14:16,450
Wait, why didn't you pick iron golems?

2572
02:14:16,470 --> 02:14:16,930
You know what?

2573
02:14:17,010 --> 02:14:18,030
I didn't even think about that.

2574
02:14:18,070 --> 02:14:21,170
They give you a flower.

2575
02:14:27,070 --> 02:14:28,810
Oh my god, they can protect me.

2576
02:14:29,130 --> 02:14:30,330
Oh my god, you're so...

2577
02:14:30,330 --> 02:14:33,450
They protect you, they give you flowers.

2578
02:14:33,630 --> 02:14:34,370
This is a good answer.

2579
02:14:34,970 --> 02:14:35,690
I don't understand.

2580
02:14:36,130 --> 02:14:38,990
You chose endermen, but they're like the deadbeats of Minecraft.

2581
02:14:39,250 --> 02:14:39,490
What?

2582
02:14:39,570 --> 02:14:40,770
No, they pick up.

2583
02:14:40,910 --> 02:14:42,850
They are literally picking up stuff.

2584
02:14:42,850 --> 02:14:43,970
Oh my god, granny!

2585
02:14:44,250 --> 02:14:44,990
Pick granny!

2586
02:14:46,030 --> 02:14:46,410
True!

2587
02:14:48,650 --> 02:14:52,030
The moment you splash a little water, they're not coming back.

2588
02:14:52,150 --> 02:14:52,850
Oh, we got an ad.

2589
02:14:55,270 --> 02:14:56,270
I'm kind of hungry.

2590
02:14:56,690 --> 02:14:57,990
I'm kind of hungry right now, hello?

2591
02:14:58,850 --> 02:14:59,670
Anyone else hungry?

2592
02:15:02,130 --> 02:15:05,830
We're gonna be watching Kanna vs Firepup.

2593
02:15:06,250 --> 02:15:07,550
Oh my god, this is the gold mod.

2594
02:15:08,390 --> 02:15:08,870
Wow!

2595
02:15:08,870 --> 02:15:09,270
Wow!

2596
02:15:10,630 --> 02:15:11,490
I was so locked in.

2597
02:15:11,590 --> 02:15:13,390
I think I got the people right.

2598
02:15:13,490 --> 02:15:14,730
I think I got the matchups right.

2599
02:15:14,930 --> 02:15:16,170
I'm the Minecraft pro.

2600
02:15:16,490 --> 02:15:17,130
That's me.

2601
02:15:18,190 --> 02:15:19,010
Yeah, you're chilling.

2602
02:15:21,670 --> 02:15:24,870
Team Kanna vs Team Firepup.

2603
02:15:27,230 --> 02:15:28,690
That's what we'll be spectating.

2604
02:15:29,050 --> 02:15:32,590
And then the other team is Team SmallAnt vs Team Sparkles.

2605
02:15:34,970 --> 02:15:35,450
Wow!

2606
02:15:35,450 --> 02:15:36,050
Wow!

2607
02:15:36,590 --> 02:15:39,630
Wait, do they take damage from the fire and stuff?

2608
02:15:39,810 --> 02:15:41,190
Yeah, I wonder if the lava hurts them.

2609
02:15:41,190 --> 02:15:41,970
Probably, right?

2610
02:15:42,130 --> 02:15:43,570
You probably don't want to jump into the lava.

2611
02:15:43,750 --> 02:15:47,310
But I bet there's something inside the mouths.

2612
02:15:47,390 --> 02:15:48,790
You see how there's a bit of pockle?

2613
02:15:49,230 --> 02:15:50,710
You have to jump for the beef, I think.

2614
02:15:50,770 --> 02:15:53,890
I think there's gonna be the mobs that spawn in the middle that might give you lots of coins.

2615
02:15:54,410 --> 02:15:57,430
You gotta travel over that lava and not get hit off.

2616
02:15:59,250 --> 02:16:01,890
Wait, I like how someone in my chat was like, is this the UK?

2617
02:16:02,790 --> 02:16:04,390
Hey, be nice, okay?

2618
02:16:04,850 --> 02:16:06,430
We don't have hot weather over here.

2619
02:16:06,510 --> 02:16:07,210
It would be raining.

2620
02:16:07,390 --> 02:16:08,870
If it was raining, yeah, that's the UK.

2621
02:16:08,890 --> 02:16:10,490
Yeah, it'd be a lot more grey.

2622
02:16:12,130 --> 02:16:12,890
That's true.

2623
02:16:13,590 --> 02:16:17,610
What's that new biome that turns the whole sky grey?

2624
02:16:18,850 --> 02:16:19,790
That's the UK?

2625
02:16:22,110 --> 02:16:25,230
Wait, did you see the newest updates in Minecraft?

2626
02:16:25,870 --> 02:16:29,490
Dude, maybe someone should've been going for the creaking, bro.

2627
02:16:29,490 --> 02:16:31,110
They hide their hearts somewhere.

2628
02:16:31,270 --> 02:16:32,590
Actually, that's kind of not good to date.

2629
02:16:37,810 --> 02:16:38,690
The creaking.

2630
02:16:38,690 --> 02:16:40,390
Oh my god, this looks so gloomy.

2631
02:16:40,750 --> 02:16:44,630
We were just at the sweet map, and now we're in the underworld.

2632
02:16:44,790 --> 02:16:45,170
I know.

2633
02:16:46,690 --> 02:16:48,290
It was really cute.

2634
02:16:48,630 --> 02:16:52,390
It's because we committed sin by talking about which Minecraft mob it is.

2635
02:16:53,750 --> 02:16:54,910
They're like, remember what you said.

2636
02:16:54,930 --> 02:16:57,270
What the heck is an Omnigast?

2637
02:16:58,090 --> 02:16:58,530
Omnigast?

2638
02:16:58,750 --> 02:17:00,270
It's got four faces, dude.

2639
02:17:02,990 --> 02:17:04,770
It's got a face on all of the sides.

2640
02:17:05,130 --> 02:17:06,970
Oh, that's gross.

2641
02:17:07,210 --> 02:17:08,170
I don't like that one.

2642
02:17:09,630 --> 02:17:11,990
Wait, can you ride the strider into the middle?

2643
02:17:13,030 --> 02:17:13,510
I wish.

2644
02:17:13,590 --> 02:17:14,770
That would be awesome if you could.

2645
02:17:16,330 --> 02:17:16,990
That'd be cute.

2646
02:17:17,410 --> 02:17:18,610
Oh my god, they already killed somebody.

2647
02:17:20,410 --> 02:17:22,030
We already have aggression.

2648
02:17:22,510 --> 02:17:24,150
We were like, I miss gum gum.

2649
02:17:24,150 --> 02:17:27,550
Dude, oh, I miss gum gum too.

2650
02:17:27,830 --> 02:17:29,230
We all miss gum gum.

2651
02:17:29,490 --> 02:17:31,250
Gum gum is better than this Omnigast.

2652
02:17:31,790 --> 02:17:32,830
Omnigast is washed.

2653
02:17:33,910 --> 02:17:36,150
Little rascals just chilling over there.

2654
02:17:36,510 --> 02:17:37,430
Jump into the lava!

2655
02:17:37,770 --> 02:17:38,330
Do it!

2656
02:17:38,390 --> 02:17:38,950
For science!

2657
02:17:39,850 --> 02:17:40,910
It'll be so funny.

2658
02:17:41,150 --> 02:17:42,590
Do it while the caster is watching.

2659
02:17:43,210 --> 02:17:46,010
We gotta find someone that jumps into the lava.

2660
02:17:46,110 --> 02:17:46,990
I'm sure that'll happen.

2661
02:17:47,190 --> 02:17:48,650
I'm sure that someone's gonna fall in.

2662
02:17:48,670 --> 02:17:49,410
Place your bets.

2663
02:17:49,410 --> 02:17:50,270
That's curious.

2664
02:17:51,970 --> 02:17:54,850
That's curious and be like, I wonder if I'll survive.

2665
02:17:55,310 --> 02:17:55,770
Yeah.

2666
02:17:57,610 --> 02:17:58,070
Hmm.

2667
02:17:59,050 --> 02:17:59,750
The farming.

2668
02:18:01,590 --> 02:18:04,390
This is what kind of seems to happen at the start of every game, right?

2669
02:18:04,430 --> 02:18:05,650
They're just killing the mobs.

2670
02:18:05,790 --> 02:18:08,090
They're not worrying about kills or towers.

2671
02:18:08,830 --> 02:18:10,470
Oh, it's a zombie horse.

2672
02:18:11,070 --> 02:18:15,490
I love how a lot of the mobs are striders wearing a hat.

2673
02:18:15,630 --> 02:18:16,270
It's so cute.

2674
02:18:16,270 --> 02:18:17,470
Dude, he's got a top hat on, hello?

2675
02:18:17,770 --> 02:18:19,230
Yeah, he's got his little hat on.

2676
02:18:20,130 --> 02:18:23,590
I like how they all have these little custom costumes too.

2677
02:18:26,910 --> 02:18:28,150
Oh my god, no!

2678
02:18:28,310 --> 02:18:30,590
Leave those poor sh- Wait, is that bunny boy?

2679
02:18:32,430 --> 02:18:34,330
Wait, is that the bunny boy skin?

2680
02:18:34,730 --> 02:18:36,270
He looks like the Easter rabbit.

2681
02:18:36,670 --> 02:18:40,690
We actually have a bit of variation in between the two teams this time.

2682
02:18:42,170 --> 02:18:43,130
Oh, you're right.

2683
02:18:43,210 --> 02:18:44,050
Yeah, I see it.

2684
02:18:44,710 --> 02:18:46,050
Hangi's got the fire guy.

2685
02:18:46,270 --> 02:18:51,270
Hannah's team has like, yeah, Hannah's team has fire guy and, oh, bunny boy.

2686
02:18:51,390 --> 02:18:52,170
They still have bunny boy.

2687
02:18:52,590 --> 02:18:54,050
It's like fire guy versus...

2688
02:18:55,370 --> 02:18:56,070
What's the fire guy's name?

2689
02:18:56,070 --> 02:18:57,570
Have we figured out what that guy is yet?

2690
02:18:57,850 --> 02:18:58,350
Dude, no.

2691
02:19:00,950 --> 02:19:01,770
We still haven't figured it out.

2692
02:19:01,770 --> 02:19:02,870
You could have given me an hour.

2693
02:19:03,050 --> 02:19:04,770
I read through this document I'm like, I have no idea.

2694
02:19:05,030 --> 02:19:05,730
It's one of these.

2695
02:19:05,770 --> 02:19:07,850
Maybe the mods, maybe the admins know.

2696
02:19:08,150 --> 02:19:09,970
Admins, if you're watching, what is that?

2697
02:19:13,310 --> 02:19:14,030
What is...

2698
02:19:14,570 --> 02:19:14,970
Yeah.

2699
02:19:15,350 --> 02:19:16,830
We know you're watching.

2700
02:19:18,530 --> 02:19:23,170
Yo, do one of you two want to try and tell me what Hangi's name is?

2701
02:19:23,350 --> 02:19:25,290
It's the Pyro Elemental.

2702
02:19:25,370 --> 02:19:26,530
You guys can say the name though.

2703
02:19:26,650 --> 02:19:27,590
Oh, I'll find it.

2704
02:19:27,670 --> 02:19:27,850
Hold on.

2705
02:19:28,330 --> 02:19:29,070
Pyro Elemental.

2706
02:19:29,390 --> 02:19:30,070
Hold on, I'll search.

2707
02:19:31,910 --> 02:19:33,930
I've got it on my screen, but I'm going to let you read it.

2708
02:19:35,970 --> 02:19:41,010
Ignis Ullabagin St. Germain Kedrick Von Constantine.

2709
02:19:41,010 --> 02:19:41,790
That's the one.

2710
02:19:41,790 --> 02:19:45,030
I would have said that too, but I was a bit, you know...

2711
02:19:45,770 --> 02:19:47,510
I had something in my throat.

2712
02:19:47,950 --> 02:19:48,750
Oh, okay.

2713
02:19:50,250 --> 02:19:51,870
Why is my table floating?

2714
02:19:52,010 --> 02:19:52,870
What did you just say?

2715
02:19:53,230 --> 02:19:57,970
The admin said that, but still won't tell us what the fork is.

2716
02:19:58,290 --> 02:19:59,930
Tell me what the guy is playing.

2717
02:20:01,070 --> 02:20:03,870
I'm just going to screenshot it and say, who is this?

2718
02:20:04,370 --> 02:20:05,310
Who is this?

2719
02:20:06,890 --> 02:20:11,930
They responded to Min saying a name, but we still don't know who this guy is.

2720
02:20:13,690 --> 02:20:17,750
We need to know the one with the scouter, the dragonball scouter.

2721
02:20:19,450 --> 02:20:20,750
Oh, it is Chulibot!

2722
02:20:21,030 --> 02:20:21,790
I got it right!

2723
02:20:22,350 --> 02:20:26,430
It's fine, I'm back as the Minecraft pro.

2724
02:20:26,690 --> 02:20:27,470
I'm the goat like that.

2725
02:20:27,870 --> 02:20:28,230
I got it right.

2726
02:20:28,730 --> 02:20:30,550
Get off your high horse now.

2727
02:20:30,970 --> 02:20:32,410
We need to knock you down, okay?

2728
02:20:33,630 --> 02:20:34,590
Okay, sorry.

2729
02:20:34,850 --> 02:20:35,830
It wasn't you.

2730
02:20:39,270 --> 02:20:42,110
Are you sure you even went to Minecraft University?

2731
02:20:42,690 --> 02:20:43,830
Where's your degree?

2732
02:20:48,290 --> 02:20:50,630
Give me the lore on fire guy.

2733
02:20:51,690 --> 02:20:53,270
His hair is fire.

2734
02:20:53,530 --> 02:20:54,690
His hands are fire.

2735
02:20:55,150 --> 02:20:56,970
He's on fire.

2736
02:20:57,290 --> 02:20:58,610
Wait, is that really the lore?

2737
02:20:59,550 --> 02:21:01,570
That's actually the character synopsis.

2738
02:21:01,950 --> 02:21:02,190
What?

2739
02:21:03,030 --> 02:21:03,590
Really?

2740
02:21:07,930 --> 02:21:09,790
There's no age or anything.

2741
02:21:09,950 --> 02:21:11,290
He's just on fire.

2742
02:21:11,390 --> 02:21:13,190
He's 28 years old.

2743
02:21:13,850 --> 02:21:16,090
He's old.

2744
02:21:17,770 --> 02:21:22,950
He's playing for the thrill of the game.

2745
02:21:23,510 --> 02:21:25,190
For the thrill.

2746
02:21:25,850 --> 02:21:26,370
Wait.

2747
02:21:27,530 --> 02:21:28,270
They've got a brother.

2748
02:21:29,150 --> 02:21:32,130
In the game, the lore says that they've got a brother.

2749
02:21:32,310 --> 02:21:32,710
Am I crazy?

2750
02:21:33,190 --> 02:21:33,950
Who's the brother?

2751
02:21:35,110 --> 02:21:36,610
Okay, it makes sense.

2752
02:21:36,910 --> 02:21:45,390
Actually, their brother is Froska Olwench St. Ward Bonstrap von Constantine, which kind of makes sense.

2753
02:21:46,210 --> 02:21:48,990
So there's a fire guy and an ice guy.

2754
02:21:49,670 --> 02:21:50,990
Oh, there's opposites!

2755
02:21:51,730 --> 02:21:52,590
Oh my god!

2756
02:21:52,870 --> 02:22:00,390
It's just like that one song, that one movie where there was a fire guy and the ice guy in that Christmas movie.

2757
02:22:00,590 --> 02:22:01,930
Oh, I know what you're talking about.

2758
02:22:01,950 --> 02:22:03,510
Yeah, the Rudolph one.

2759
02:22:04,350 --> 02:22:05,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2760
02:22:05,950 --> 02:22:08,170
Like Snowmizer and Firemizer.

2761
02:22:08,530 --> 02:22:09,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2762
02:22:11,590 --> 02:22:13,670
They could've literally...

2763
02:22:13,670 --> 02:22:21,030
Oh my gosh, now I'm kind of sad that Team 2 didn't give us the brotherly showdown.

2764
02:22:21,870 --> 02:22:22,790
Right, yeah.

2765
02:22:23,290 --> 02:22:25,590
Did you see the picture they sent?

2766
02:22:33,350 --> 02:22:36,010
Alright, they're going for the ghast.

2767
02:22:36,790 --> 02:22:39,170
Oh, they almost got the ghast.

2768
02:22:39,190 --> 02:22:40,110
Who's the blue team again?

2769
02:22:41,270 --> 02:22:42,870
Blue team is Team 5 up.

2770
02:22:43,030 --> 02:22:44,330
Oh, 5 of us right here.

2771
02:22:44,590 --> 02:22:50,110
No one's damaged any crystals or any towers yet, but blue are probably getting the ghast.

2772
02:22:50,550 --> 02:22:54,010
Yeah, I assume it's also a lot harder too.

2773
02:22:54,330 --> 02:22:55,350
Oh, he's trying to steal.

2774
02:22:55,730 --> 02:22:56,690
Did he get the steal?

2775
02:22:57,210 --> 02:22:57,710
Did he get it?

2776
02:22:57,890 --> 02:22:59,250
I have no idea.

2777
02:23:00,270 --> 02:23:01,770
Loki, I hope he did.

2778
02:23:02,050 --> 02:23:06,930
I saw over him, but I'm not sure if that was...

2779
02:23:06,930 --> 02:23:07,850
I don't know.

2780
02:23:08,030 --> 02:23:09,230
I don't know if he stole it.

2781
02:23:12,170 --> 02:23:13,290
I can't tell.

2782
02:23:14,050 --> 02:23:16,870
It's very hard to tell from here if they stole it or not.

2783
02:23:17,970 --> 02:23:23,670
I mean, that's... I like how he just ran up there and just slapped it and nobody cared.

2784
02:23:23,670 --> 02:23:24,490
No one cared.

2785
02:23:24,670 --> 02:23:28,290
They just let him slap the ghast.

2786
02:23:28,510 --> 02:23:29,310
I was like, okay.

2787
02:23:29,310 --> 02:23:34,310
Could have been a good time to sneak over to the blue team.

2788
02:23:34,430 --> 02:23:35,970
I like how people are like, they got one guy to get.

2789
02:23:37,510 --> 02:23:39,870
It's the same one guy from game one.

2790
02:23:40,050 --> 02:23:40,970
It's the one guy strat.

2791
02:23:41,310 --> 02:23:42,150
The one guy strat.

2792
02:23:43,070 --> 02:23:44,710
It's your buddy or your friend.

2793
02:23:45,230 --> 02:23:45,890
Your other friend.

2794
02:23:46,790 --> 02:23:47,610
You have too many friends.

2795
02:23:48,070 --> 02:23:48,870
I've got a few of them.

2796
02:23:48,870 --> 02:23:49,510
Don't worry.

2797
02:23:49,950 --> 02:23:51,050
I've got a custom one.

2798
02:23:52,090 --> 02:23:57,770
Okay, I'm gonna say three people right now that are in this game that I don't like anymore.

2799
02:23:57,970 --> 02:24:00,130
Okay, number one is... I'm joking.

2800
02:24:00,330 --> 02:24:01,170
I can't do it.

2801
02:24:01,330 --> 02:24:02,830
Oh, you coward.

2802
02:24:05,070 --> 02:24:06,190
I'll say it.

2803
02:24:06,210 --> 02:24:07,590
I don't like Doki Bird.

2804
02:24:08,270 --> 02:24:09,010
Oh, yeah.

2805
02:24:09,170 --> 02:24:10,350
I hate you too.

2806
02:24:11,810 --> 02:24:12,750
Oh my god, we've got drama.

2807
02:24:13,010 --> 02:24:14,270
It was all fake.

2808
02:24:14,390 --> 02:24:17,250
We manufactured it for stream because we know people love that shit.

2809
02:24:17,410 --> 02:24:19,310
I'm typing the twit longer right now.

2810
02:24:19,450 --> 02:24:19,910
Oh my god.

2811
02:24:21,490 --> 02:24:23,010
Yeah, you were here in the middle.

2812
02:24:23,250 --> 02:24:24,330
You witnessed it all.

2813
02:24:24,330 --> 02:24:26,330
Oh my god.

2814
02:24:27,730 --> 02:24:30,190
We're gonna manufacture drama right now.

2815
02:24:30,330 --> 02:24:30,990
For the thrill.

2816
02:24:31,190 --> 02:24:31,990
For the excitement.

2817
02:24:32,790 --> 02:24:34,890
Just like that fire guy.

2818
02:24:35,990 --> 02:24:37,110
Cut the camera.

2819
02:24:37,570 --> 02:24:38,330
We're going home.

2820
02:24:38,970 --> 02:24:41,030
We need a dramatic walk off set.

2821
02:24:41,130 --> 02:24:41,950
In fact, I'll do that.

2822
02:24:42,250 --> 02:24:43,130
I'll walk off set.

2823
02:24:44,370 --> 02:24:45,150
And I just leave.

2824
02:24:53,030 --> 02:24:54,150
That's so good.

2825
02:24:54,490 --> 02:24:54,590
That's so good.

2826
02:24:54,590 --> 02:24:57,110
I can't keep casting if she's gonna be in this call.

2827
02:25:01,190 --> 02:25:02,430
This is true.

2828
02:25:02,590 --> 02:25:03,690
This is the entertainment, everybody.

2829
02:25:04,330 --> 02:25:05,050
Yeah, this is the entertainment.

2830
02:25:09,090 --> 02:25:09,970
Oh my god.

2831
02:25:10,470 --> 02:25:12,330
He's wearing a cowboy hat.

2832
02:25:12,330 --> 02:25:13,770
What is he yee-hawing about?

2833
02:25:14,710 --> 02:25:16,530
Why is he yee-hawing in hell?

2834
02:25:19,050 --> 02:25:21,750
That's basically the place to yee-haw.

2835
02:25:22,430 --> 02:25:24,630
The little scarabs are cute too.

2836
02:25:26,970 --> 02:25:30,830
It looked like, just at a glance, it looked like blue team all had an ult.

2837
02:25:30,950 --> 02:25:34,050
Maybe they've been saving it up to try and do one big push.

2838
02:25:34,230 --> 02:25:36,330
I think all five of them have an ult.

2839
02:25:36,470 --> 02:25:37,190
We can't see it now.

2840
02:25:37,290 --> 02:25:37,590
Here we go.

2841
02:25:38,170 --> 02:25:40,330
All five of blue team have their ults ready.

2842
02:25:40,330 --> 02:25:41,050
Are they pushing?

2843
02:25:41,810 --> 02:25:44,130
To be fair, three of the red team do as well.

2844
02:25:44,550 --> 02:25:46,110
Yeah, blue team are pushing right now.

2845
02:25:46,370 --> 02:25:48,550
Red tower under attack.

2846
02:25:49,110 --> 02:25:50,330
Red tower under attack.

2847
02:25:50,650 --> 02:25:51,550
Red tower under attack.

2848
02:25:51,930 --> 02:25:53,030
They're all ulting.

2849
02:25:54,210 --> 02:25:56,250
One of them died already.

2850
02:25:56,930 --> 02:25:58,270
Need to get Pangi down.

2851
02:25:58,370 --> 02:25:58,710
There we go.

2852
02:25:58,790 --> 02:25:59,330
Pangi's dead.

2853
02:25:59,990 --> 02:26:01,090
Oh, but it's a 3v4.

2854
02:26:01,370 --> 02:26:03,070
They had enough time to respawn.

2855
02:26:03,510 --> 02:26:04,930
It's not gonna do that much.

2856
02:26:05,690 --> 02:26:07,050
Yeah, because it's their first death.

2857
02:26:07,050 --> 02:26:11,270
Yeah, I was gonna say, if this were late game, it would be huge.

2858
02:26:11,290 --> 02:26:11,770
It's not great.

2859
02:26:14,410 --> 02:26:21,010
I mean, yeah, it was an okay push, but they've all used their ults now, and they didn't do that much.

2860
02:26:21,350 --> 02:26:25,790
Red have three ults themselves and could do a really cool counterattack right now.

2861
02:26:29,750 --> 02:26:31,870
They seem to be heading over.

2862
02:26:32,090 --> 02:26:32,090
Oh!

2863
02:26:33,930 --> 02:26:38,350
Little flank there, but it's that one red guy that's kinda still protected.

2864
02:26:38,470 --> 02:26:39,190
I don't know.

2865
02:26:39,530 --> 02:26:44,610
I don't know how many different paths there are into the dragon.

2866
02:26:44,810 --> 02:26:46,450
There has to be three lanes, right?

2867
02:26:46,630 --> 02:26:47,470
I think so.

2868
02:26:47,650 --> 02:26:47,990
In the jungle.

2869
02:26:48,230 --> 02:26:48,510
Technically.

2870
02:26:50,970 --> 02:26:52,970
I mean, that's usually how MOBAs go.

2871
02:26:53,030 --> 02:26:56,550
They usually have three lanes, and then there's the jungle where they can flank and stuff.

2872
02:26:59,110 --> 02:27:03,130
I mean, red team... Oh my god, one tower is almost gone, too, for red team.

2873
02:27:05,130 --> 02:27:09,750
Yeah, they were still able to do, you know, a chip of damage.

2874
02:27:10,230 --> 02:27:11,390
I can't tell.

2875
02:27:11,970 --> 02:27:19,510
Honestly, I feel like, with the games going on right now, blue team is having an advantage over red team.

2876
02:27:19,730 --> 02:27:24,970
We saw small hands team destroy blue team, so like...

2877
02:27:24,970 --> 02:27:27,230
I feel like small hands team has to...

2878
02:27:27,230 --> 02:27:28,890
Oh my god, see, he's just hiding there.

2879
02:27:28,890 --> 02:27:29,570
He's healing.

2880
02:27:32,270 --> 02:27:33,250
Oh, and he popped out.

2881
02:27:34,070 --> 02:27:35,430
Oh my god, he's so fast!

2882
02:27:35,430 --> 02:27:36,230
Is that his ult?

2883
02:27:37,430 --> 02:27:38,430
We're at ult.

2884
02:27:39,410 --> 02:27:40,610
Oh, he's dead.

2885
02:27:41,350 --> 02:27:41,970
He's dead.

2886
02:27:42,750 --> 02:27:47,070
He's like, I can solo him, and then he dies instantly.

2887
02:27:50,970 --> 02:27:52,410
Oh, that's a tower down.

2888
02:27:53,430 --> 02:27:54,770
He killed one of the towers.

2889
02:27:54,790 --> 02:27:55,930
When did he get that tower?

2890
02:27:56,730 --> 02:27:59,090
For a non-league player, Doki knows a lot.

2891
02:27:59,170 --> 02:28:00,890
I played deadlock, guys.

2892
02:28:00,890 --> 02:28:01,690
I played it.

2893
02:28:01,970 --> 02:28:06,710
She's a league player in denial, truly.

2894
02:28:06,930 --> 02:28:09,710
I played deadlock, it's practically league.

2895
02:28:12,210 --> 02:28:15,350
Practically league is saying league in the same sentence.

2896
02:28:15,650 --> 02:28:15,990
No, it's not.

2897
02:28:16,650 --> 02:28:17,590
It is, actually.

2898
02:28:18,290 --> 02:28:20,350
No, it's not.

2899
02:28:20,850 --> 02:28:22,810
League is like, more miserable.

2900
02:28:26,470 --> 02:28:29,690
I don't know anything about MOBAs, I'm here for the fun.

2901
02:28:30,510 --> 02:28:32,150
She's here for the thrill of it.

2902
02:28:32,210 --> 02:28:33,270
I'm here for the thrill of it.

2903
02:28:33,330 --> 02:28:33,910
Call me.

2904
02:28:34,250 --> 02:28:35,710
I'm here for the cat, bro, I'm gonna be honest.

2905
02:28:35,930 --> 02:28:37,770
I'm only playing for my cat, you know what I mean?

2906
02:28:39,130 --> 02:28:40,150
I'm here for gum gum.

2907
02:28:41,050 --> 02:28:42,350
I miss gum gum.

2908
02:28:42,570 --> 02:28:43,590
Bring gum gum back.

2909
02:28:44,490 --> 02:28:46,290
Gum gum, final boss, gum gum.

2910
02:28:48,570 --> 02:28:52,130
Just put, just change all the textures to gum gum at this point.

2911
02:28:53,530 --> 02:28:56,330
Instead of wither skeleton that's guarded by a gum gum.

2912
02:28:58,990 --> 02:29:01,270
Gum gum that shoots out little fireballs.

2913
02:29:03,090 --> 02:29:05,690
I think he's doing a lot of damage to be fair.

2914
02:29:10,970 --> 02:29:12,170
Couldn't one man it, though.

2915
02:29:12,490 --> 02:29:15,050
Even though you got pretty close, the health is low.

2916
02:29:15,450 --> 02:29:15,810
Yeah.

2917
02:29:16,310 --> 02:29:17,330
I mean, yeah.

2918
02:29:17,830 --> 02:29:23,770
I mean, they're doing the one guy strat again where like, everybody else acts as a distraction, but I don't know if for this team if it works.

2919
02:29:23,910 --> 02:29:29,330
I love how the bun rabbit boy's costume is just a guy with rabbit ears.

2920
02:29:29,330 --> 02:29:29,910
I know.

2921
02:29:30,350 --> 02:29:32,570
It's like he's cosplaying right now.

2922
02:29:36,410 --> 02:29:37,950
Oh my god, look at this.

2923
02:29:38,130 --> 02:29:41,570
I was going to say, like, look at those dodges.

2924
02:29:42,710 --> 02:29:43,410
And then he died.

2925
02:29:45,050 --> 02:29:46,910
Here we go, the one guy strat.

2926
02:29:48,050 --> 02:29:49,370
Or in this situation, one gal.

2927
02:29:49,550 --> 02:29:50,630
Hannah's right here.

2928
02:29:51,490 --> 02:29:52,510
One gal strat.

2929
02:29:54,210 --> 02:29:57,970
Decides to dodge that tower and go for the one that has lower health to try and get it killed.

2930
02:29:58,330 --> 02:29:59,070
That's smart.

2931
02:29:59,370 --> 02:30:10,090
I don't know if it's smart against this team to do that because it feels so... I feel like the other team is more like working together to grab the towers.

2932
02:30:11,850 --> 02:30:17,070
I mean, I think we'll find out, but bear in mind, last match we watched was pretty much done at this point.

2933
02:30:17,170 --> 02:30:18,470
We got it done in 15 minutes.

2934
02:30:18,630 --> 02:30:21,390
Like, we've only got one tower down.

2935
02:30:21,550 --> 02:30:24,910
And last time they had all the towers, all the crystals, and the dragon.

2936
02:30:25,370 --> 02:30:27,590
I think this match is definitely a lot slower.

2937
02:30:27,930 --> 02:30:29,810
They're a little more evenly matched.

2938
02:30:29,810 --> 02:30:31,750
Maybe it's because of the match in the teams, right?

2939
02:30:32,490 --> 02:30:39,030
Same with, like, I feel like Oh, wait, SmallAnt already won their game.

2940
02:30:39,090 --> 02:30:40,130
No way!

2941
02:30:41,630 --> 02:30:43,550
I'm on fire today, baby!

2942
02:30:44,010 --> 02:30:49,130
I'm not sure my chat's lying to me, but someone was like, someone wrote SmallAnt won.

2943
02:30:49,230 --> 02:30:51,070
No, I see it on the... I see it, too.

2944
02:30:51,310 --> 02:30:51,610
Oh, wait.

2945
02:30:51,790 --> 02:30:52,670
No, I don't see it.

2946
02:30:52,690 --> 02:30:53,070
Just kidding.

2947
02:30:53,630 --> 02:30:54,550
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2948
02:30:54,570 --> 02:30:55,010
I do see it.

2949
02:30:55,710 --> 02:30:58,330
Oh, my God, that's crazy.

2950
02:30:58,530 --> 02:30:59,570
That's so fast.

2951
02:31:00,110 --> 02:31:15,030
I think judging by, because, like, whoever wins this matchup, I think they're, like, because, like, we saw like, Hannah won against CaptainSparklez, and then SmallAnt demolished a 5ups team.

2952
02:31:15,170 --> 02:31:17,770
So, like, I think we can tell who's gonna win it.

2953
02:31:17,770 --> 02:31:20,010
Just from that.

2954
02:31:21,070 --> 02:31:25,290
Unless, like, whoever is facing SmallAnt's gonna have, like, the most miracle run ever.

2955
02:31:25,370 --> 02:31:30,050
It could, you know, it could be, like, a map goes against, you know, someone's play or something.

2956
02:31:30,090 --> 02:31:31,110
Or, like, underdog.

2957
02:31:31,190 --> 02:31:31,530
Yeah.

2958
02:31:32,470 --> 02:31:33,350
The underdog.

2959
02:31:34,190 --> 02:31:35,230
We don't wanna jinx anybody.

2960
02:31:35,790 --> 02:31:39,610
Maybe, like, someone on SmallAnt's team crashes.

2961
02:31:40,470 --> 02:31:43,930
We just had another team come in.

2962
02:31:45,310 --> 02:31:48,270
Snipperish lost to btmc.

2963
02:31:49,710 --> 02:31:51,230
You see that little buffoo?

2964
02:31:51,650 --> 02:31:55,310
That's one of those lower bracket team matchups right there.

2965
02:31:55,710 --> 02:32:00,090
And that still matters because, obviously, the prizes are gonna change between 8th and 1st.

2966
02:32:00,410 --> 02:32:05,150
So, even if you're in that lower bracket, you're still gonna try and get to that top 5.

2967
02:32:05,210 --> 02:32:09,090
If you can get 5th, that's still a big, hey, everyone's gonna go home happy, I think.

2968
02:32:09,610 --> 02:32:09,810
Yeah, exactly.

2969
02:32:16,290 --> 02:32:17,750
BlueCrystal under attack.

2970
02:32:18,890 --> 02:32:22,090
Oh my gosh, she's taking him on an adventure right now.

2971
02:32:22,090 --> 02:32:22,650
It's going down.

2972
02:32:22,730 --> 02:32:23,210
Oh my gosh.

2973
02:32:23,370 --> 02:32:24,230
Is it getting soloed?

2974
02:32:24,650 --> 02:32:25,230
Oh my god.

2975
02:32:25,830 --> 02:32:26,950
And there it is.

2976
02:32:27,170 --> 02:32:28,010
Oh, it's down.

2977
02:32:29,210 --> 02:32:31,410
And then the next tower, the next tower.

2978
02:32:32,610 --> 02:32:33,750
1 HP on that tower.

2979
02:32:33,890 --> 02:32:35,590
I think they just died at the 1 HP.

2980
02:32:35,890 --> 02:32:38,210
Oh, that was close.

2981
02:32:41,310 --> 02:32:41,750
That's...

2982
02:32:42,750 --> 02:32:44,450
I mean, there's 9 seconds left.

2983
02:32:44,490 --> 02:32:47,290
After that, the whole tower takes damage, I believe, right?

2984
02:32:48,590 --> 02:32:50,810
Oh yeah, they're about to... let's see.

2985
02:32:51,810 --> 02:32:52,370
Huh?

2986
02:32:53,130 --> 02:32:53,810
Wait, what?

2987
02:32:58,050 --> 02:33:01,810
That counter is a little mysterious for us.

2988
02:33:02,250 --> 02:33:03,450
Yeah, it's a little mysterious.

2989
02:33:03,870 --> 02:33:05,190
I still don't understand that.

2990
02:33:05,310 --> 02:33:07,970
And another tower down on the red team!

2991
02:33:08,390 --> 02:33:08,430
Yeah!

2992
02:33:09,130 --> 02:33:10,770
And they're going after the crystal.

2993
02:33:10,990 --> 02:33:11,470
Oh my gosh.

2994
02:33:13,670 --> 02:33:17,050
I guess that is... that has to be the mid-boss then.

2995
02:33:18,570 --> 02:33:21,230
Remember that one time when all the towers got hit?

2996
02:33:21,990 --> 02:33:23,390
I wonder what that was.

2997
02:33:24,630 --> 02:33:26,050
Yeah, the mid-boss is back.

2998
02:33:26,250 --> 02:33:28,030
I guess that was a mid-boss time.

2999
02:33:28,130 --> 02:33:28,930
I wonder what that was.

3000
02:33:28,970 --> 02:33:33,030
Remember when a timer was going down and all the towers got hit at once?

3001
02:33:33,150 --> 02:33:33,710
Oh, there it is.

3002
02:33:33,730 --> 02:33:34,130
Never mind.

3003
02:33:34,170 --> 02:33:34,590
It happened.

3004
02:33:35,030 --> 02:33:35,430
Oh, yeah.

3005
02:33:35,510 --> 02:33:36,070
There it is.

3006
02:33:36,210 --> 02:33:36,670
It just... okay.

3007
02:33:36,950 --> 02:33:37,410
There it is.

3008
02:33:37,650 --> 02:33:39,510
There was a little delay, but there it is.

3009
02:33:39,650 --> 02:33:41,670
Oh my gosh, that really...

3010
02:33:41,670 --> 02:33:43,810
makes it look like everybody is kind of...

3011
02:33:49,960 --> 02:33:51,080
There it is.

3012
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:58,240
I guess because they killed the boss the moment... the right time when the towers lost HP, too.

3013
02:33:58,380 --> 02:34:00,100
So it was just timing-wise.

3014
02:34:01,080 --> 02:34:01,640
Oh my God.

3015
02:34:01,840 --> 02:34:02,080
Solo.

3016
02:34:02,460 --> 02:34:03,120
Let's go.

3017
02:34:03,900 --> 02:34:04,440
Let's go.

3018
02:34:05,880 --> 02:34:07,000
I will solo her.

3019
02:34:07,720 --> 02:34:09,100
That's the last tower.

3020
02:34:09,400 --> 02:34:11,480
That's the last wither down for team 2.

3021
02:34:12,420 --> 02:34:13,100
Oh my God.

3022
02:34:13,100 --> 02:34:15,440
The ult to the crystal is so smart.

3023
02:34:17,480 --> 02:34:21,520
Yeah, I think it really looks like red are going to take this down here.

3024
02:34:25,580 --> 02:34:29,520
They ulted to kill that last player, but, I mean, it's all down to the dragon.

3025
02:34:30,320 --> 02:34:31,000
Yeah, I'm not sure.

3026
02:34:31,460 --> 02:34:33,820
There's still three crystals and a whole tower.

3027
02:34:34,960 --> 02:34:37,420
That's pretty rough for the blue team.

3028
02:34:37,820 --> 02:34:41,660
The crystals are almost down, though, so, like, it's not going to be that rough.

3029
02:34:41,740 --> 02:34:43,240
They just need to make sure they grab.

3030
02:34:43,560 --> 02:34:45,020
Because, like, two people need to respawn.

3031
02:34:45,220 --> 02:34:48,900
So the moment they kill one of them... Oh, Pengi has, like... Oh, never mind.

3032
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:49,700
Pengi's back.

3033
02:34:50,040 --> 02:34:50,260
Yeah.

3034
02:34:51,720 --> 02:34:54,900
I was going to say, Pengi has, like, a long respawn, but he's back now.

3035
02:34:55,080 --> 02:34:56,080
Yeah, I think... Oh.

3036
02:34:56,400 --> 02:34:58,500
Maybe there's an item that you can purchase, too.

3037
02:34:58,800 --> 02:35:00,300
Because I feel like... Respawn faster?

3038
02:35:00,600 --> 02:35:00,740
Yeah.

3039
02:35:01,500 --> 02:35:04,780
Yeah, because you saw I said 58 seconds, and then they're back.

3040
02:35:04,880 --> 02:35:05,040
Yeah.

3041
02:35:05,240 --> 02:35:14,920
It's happened to me before, so I'm wondering if maybe there's an item or something that allows them to respawn more, like, faster to come in.

3042
02:35:17,500 --> 02:35:23,780
I think it may... Maybe it's just, like, the... Yeah, the timer looks like it counts down to zero and then keeps going a little bit further.

3043
02:35:24,440 --> 02:35:24,460
Oh!

3044
02:35:24,620 --> 02:35:24,960
Yeah.

3045
02:35:25,040 --> 02:35:25,680
That's why.

3046
02:35:25,960 --> 02:35:28,420
Yeah, because I was, like, wondering why it went zero and it was, like, 59.

3047
02:35:28,680 --> 02:35:29,260
Yeah, yeah.

3048
02:35:29,780 --> 02:35:31,560
And I was, like, whoa, that's long.

3049
02:35:32,240 --> 02:35:32,240
Oh!

3050
02:35:32,600 --> 02:35:33,540
Is that an ult there?

3051
02:35:33,960 --> 02:35:34,840
Is that our fire there?

3052
02:35:35,260 --> 02:35:36,460
They almost...

3053
02:35:36,460 --> 02:35:37,540
They gotta sneak it in.

3054
02:35:38,080 --> 02:35:40,320
I mean, all of them are guarding it really well now.

3055
02:35:40,440 --> 02:35:41,560
The defense is really good.

3056
02:35:41,660 --> 02:35:43,080
But they need to offense, too.

3057
02:35:43,200 --> 02:35:44,460
Like, they can't just...

3058
02:35:46,820 --> 02:35:49,660
They're like, I'm gonna guard this dragon for 19 minutes.

3059
02:35:54,620 --> 02:35:56,020
Oh, they're on the crystals!

3060
02:35:57,420 --> 02:35:58,580
Oh, they got one of them!

3061
02:35:58,640 --> 02:35:59,540
They got one, yeah.

3062
02:36:00,980 --> 02:36:02,460
Yeah, blue dragon's under attack.

3063
02:36:02,500 --> 02:36:02,960
Oh, they're getting the dragon, though!

3064
02:36:02,960 --> 02:36:04,140
There it is, surely!

3065
02:36:04,760 --> 02:36:05,520
Oh, no way!

3066
02:36:08,440 --> 02:36:10,140
Red still have to push.

3067
02:36:10,240 --> 02:36:12,560
They've still got, like, 10% left of that dragon health.

3068
02:36:12,800 --> 02:36:14,020
I can't see blue coming, guys.

3069
02:36:14,040 --> 02:36:15,880
The thing is, they have three people that are down.

3070
02:36:16,140 --> 02:36:19,520
And the blue team knows that three people are down, so they're rushing it now.

3071
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:22,620
Oh, Kaboodle!

3072
02:36:23,200 --> 02:36:23,560
Oh, no!

3073
02:36:23,760 --> 02:36:24,560
Kaboodle got spotted!

3074
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:25,620
They saw him.

3075
02:36:25,960 --> 02:36:27,200
They saw him, though.

3076
02:36:28,840 --> 02:36:30,340
I think they're...

3077
02:36:30,980 --> 02:36:33,660
I don't think they're going after him, though.

3078
02:36:34,980 --> 02:36:36,540
He's like, psych!

3079
02:36:37,440 --> 02:36:38,600
Oh my god!

3080
02:36:39,140 --> 02:36:42,400
If Kab goes back now, she might be able to get this next crystal.

3081
02:36:42,880 --> 02:36:44,760
Or get the last damage, but...

3082
02:36:44,760 --> 02:36:46,440
No, blue are fully defending.

3083
02:36:46,700 --> 02:36:47,200
Blue are high defending.

3084
02:36:48,040 --> 02:36:49,720
There was somebody at the red team.

3085
02:36:49,740 --> 02:36:51,780
Yeah, three are on the red side.

3086
02:36:52,260 --> 02:36:52,720
Three of them.

3087
02:36:53,760 --> 02:36:55,880
Because, like, two people died already on blue.

3088
02:36:55,960 --> 02:36:56,880
Garfield's going to work.

3089
02:36:57,680 --> 02:36:58,480
Go, Garfield!

3090
02:37:01,120 --> 02:37:02,300
Yeah, they defended it.

3091
02:37:03,120 --> 02:37:04,500
Hannah's defending really well.

3092
02:37:04,880 --> 02:37:06,280
Oh, here it is!

3093
02:37:07,120 --> 02:37:08,580
One man, again!

3094
02:37:09,340 --> 02:37:10,360
The sneak attack!

3095
02:37:11,240 --> 02:37:12,380
Same thing as last time.

3096
02:37:12,520 --> 02:37:17,120
Shatter goes through, gets that final few hits on the dragon, just flanks and wins.

3097
02:37:17,120 --> 02:37:18,720
I mean, it was just a few hits left.

3098
02:37:18,720 --> 02:37:19,260
It really was.

3099
02:37:19,300 --> 02:37:22,020
It was worth the risk.

3100
02:37:22,360 --> 02:37:24,100
So that means we have our finalists, right?

3101
02:37:24,100 --> 02:37:26,440
We have Team Hannah versus Team Smallant.

3102
02:37:26,820 --> 02:37:32,220
And in that third place matchup, it's going to be Team Sparkles versus Team Five Up.

3103
02:37:32,980 --> 02:37:35,920
It's a pretty interesting matchup in both senses.

3104
02:37:36,220 --> 02:37:39,720
I mean, I assume we're going to be watching the grand finals here.

3105
02:37:39,840 --> 02:37:40,780
Hannah and Smallant.

3106
02:37:41,960 --> 02:37:44,500
I feel like it's going to be a really fast game.

3107
02:37:44,800 --> 02:37:45,260
Me too.

3108
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:47,100
I just don't know who it's going to go to.

3109
02:37:49,020 --> 02:37:50,300
You don't have to be...

3110
02:37:50,640 --> 02:37:51,660
You don't have to pretend.

3111
02:37:51,660 --> 02:37:52,160
Okay.

3112
02:37:52,180 --> 02:37:52,620
Okay.

3113
02:37:52,640 --> 02:37:53,080
Okay.

3114
02:37:53,080 --> 02:37:53,840
Maybe that's true.

3115
02:37:55,480 --> 02:37:55,920
Fine.

3116
02:37:56,060 --> 02:37:58,440
If I don't have to pretend, I know who it's going to.

3117
02:37:58,960 --> 02:38:01,340
I was going to say, this is your Minecraft analysis.

3118
02:38:01,620 --> 02:38:02,820
You don't have to pretend here.

3119
02:38:03,260 --> 02:38:05,180
And I definitely know who it is.

3120
02:38:05,360 --> 02:38:06,960
We're giving everyone a fair shot.

3121
02:38:07,260 --> 02:38:08,500
It's all for the drama.

3122
02:38:08,900 --> 02:38:09,560
It all matters.

3123
02:38:09,720 --> 02:38:10,200
You know what I mean?

3124
02:38:10,620 --> 02:38:11,860
Anyone can win.

3125
02:38:12,040 --> 02:38:13,260
No one's a loser here.

3126
02:38:13,480 --> 02:38:14,900
It's just a consolation bracket.

3127
02:38:15,260 --> 02:38:17,280
Okay, but you're an analysis, right?

3128
02:38:17,340 --> 02:38:21,180
So you're here to talk about who you think is going to win.

3129
02:38:21,420 --> 02:38:23,180
You know, as a Minecraft analysis.

3130
02:38:23,240 --> 02:38:23,500
As an analysis.

3131
02:38:24,340 --> 02:38:26,700
I already told you...

3132
02:38:26,700 --> 02:38:29,700
Who do you think is going to win this tournament?

3133
02:38:30,500 --> 02:38:32,740
I already told you who I thought my underdog was.

3134
02:38:32,940 --> 02:38:34,980
And that man right there is SilverRuns.

3135
02:38:35,120 --> 02:38:38,600
I just cannot see anyone able to face up against him.

3136
02:38:38,680 --> 02:38:41,620
I think that he's, like I say, a little bit under the radar.

3137
02:38:42,320 --> 02:38:43,500
Maybe hidden gem.

3138
02:38:44,120 --> 02:38:45,420
Sleeper agent, if you will.

3139
02:38:45,420 --> 02:38:46,780
A sleeper agent.

3140
02:38:47,160 --> 02:38:48,520
A sleeper is...

3141
02:38:49,300 --> 02:38:51,200
Really, really strong player.

3142
02:38:51,460 --> 02:38:53,420
But maybe under the radar a little bit.

3143
02:38:53,440 --> 02:38:55,480
Are you saying that he's carrying the entire team?

3144
02:38:55,960 --> 02:38:57,560
Oh, 100%.

3145
02:38:57,560 --> 02:38:57,780
Hello?

3146
02:38:58,120 --> 02:38:59,540
Like, Feinberg's mid.

3147
02:38:59,880 --> 02:39:01,180
But Silver's the GOAT.

3148
02:39:01,260 --> 02:39:01,660
You know what I mean?

3149
02:39:03,620 --> 02:39:04,400
Clip it!

3150
02:39:04,700 --> 02:39:05,300
Clip it!

3151
02:39:05,900 --> 02:39:09,120
Clip it and post it in the Minecraft community.

3152
02:39:09,240 --> 02:39:09,660
No!

3153
02:39:10,100 --> 02:39:11,660
No, I'm gonna get cancelled!

3154
02:39:12,220 --> 02:39:13,520
No, no, no!

3155
02:39:14,480 --> 02:39:15,300
Clip it!

3156
02:39:16,200 --> 02:39:18,700
Fulham says Feinberg is mid.

3157
02:39:18,820 --> 02:39:19,700
But we don't believe that.

3158
02:39:19,800 --> 02:39:21,700
Mid and I do not share the same opinion.

3159
02:39:21,920 --> 02:39:22,460
By the way.

3160
02:39:22,760 --> 02:39:24,980
We don't share the same opinion.

3161
02:39:24,980 --> 02:39:27,560
Do you guys think that team Feinberg and team SmallAnt are gonna win though?

3162
02:39:27,800 --> 02:39:32,640
Like, I think that's who the caster's booth is supporting in this final matchup.

3163
02:39:32,880 --> 02:39:35,880
I think there is some biases.

3164
02:39:36,160 --> 02:39:37,240
Not from me, of course.

3165
02:39:37,360 --> 02:39:38,340
But for a team.

3166
02:39:39,380 --> 02:39:41,780
There's never been biases anywhere.

3167
02:39:42,560 --> 02:39:46,200
I don't have any additional stakes that I've bet with anyone.

3168
02:39:48,140 --> 02:39:55,540
Not when we were talking about teams and your ears and eyes didn't perk up the moment you heard one of the teams that you get to spectate.

3169
02:39:55,540 --> 02:39:58,120
I'm just saying that I...

3170
02:39:58,120 --> 02:40:01,180
You know...

3171
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,500
It's just, there's exciting people everywhere.

3172
02:40:05,840 --> 02:40:07,280
That's all I'm gonna say.

3173
02:40:07,880 --> 02:40:10,700
Yeah, and which one are you most excited about, Mint?

3174
02:40:10,820 --> 02:40:11,780
Which one was it?

3175
02:40:11,800 --> 02:40:12,160
GumGum.

3176
02:40:12,720 --> 02:40:15,280
Yo, team GumGum.

3177
02:40:15,400 --> 02:40:16,620
I think GumGum's gonna win.

3178
02:40:16,780 --> 02:40:18,320
He was there, not gonna lie.

3179
02:40:18,440 --> 02:40:19,700
He was there!

3180
02:40:24,820 --> 02:40:34,080
The thing that's so interesting, like the game we just watched again, the team that won only got 30 kills and the team that lost got 60.

3181
02:40:34,700 --> 02:40:35,160
60!

3182
02:40:35,160 --> 02:40:35,620
60!

3183
02:40:36,520 --> 02:40:38,780
It's such a weird...

3184
02:40:38,780 --> 02:40:40,880
I think it's because of Hana's strat.

3185
02:40:41,440 --> 02:40:44,420
They literally just send one person over and that's it.

3186
02:40:44,580 --> 02:40:45,900
And it works, right?

3187
02:40:45,960 --> 02:40:47,560
Yeah, it works every time.

3188
02:40:47,760 --> 02:40:54,600
Because they lose their players during defense when they're defending the towers, but then like they only send people over to kill.

3189
02:40:54,960 --> 02:40:57,240
They just send one person over every time.

3190
02:40:57,580 --> 02:40:59,260
And it works for them.

3191
02:40:59,440 --> 02:41:02,700
And I think the rest of the team just focuses on farming creep too.

3192
02:41:03,960 --> 02:41:05,220
Which helps a lot.

3193
02:41:07,700 --> 02:41:08,220
Yeah.

3194
02:41:10,280 --> 02:41:11,260
Great analysis.

3195
02:41:11,780 --> 02:41:14,560
I believe we're watching the finals next, right?

3196
02:41:14,840 --> 02:41:19,680
I believe so and all of the teams are done, so I guess they're just setting that up.

3197
02:41:20,140 --> 02:41:21,580
Who won what?

3198
02:41:21,820 --> 02:41:22,900
Can you read it out for me?

3199
02:41:23,220 --> 02:41:25,160
We have...

3200
02:41:27,340 --> 02:41:31,960
Team Hana as our winner versus Team Paiva.

3201
02:41:33,320 --> 02:41:34,680
We have...

3202
02:41:34,680 --> 02:41:38,900
Team Smallant as our winner versus Team Sparkles.

3203
02:41:40,820 --> 02:41:42,900
And then for the...

3204
02:41:42,900 --> 02:41:44,240
What are we calling them?

3205
02:41:44,340 --> 02:41:45,140
The small league?

3206
02:41:46,140 --> 02:41:46,980
Yeah, the little league.

3207
02:41:47,120 --> 02:41:47,540
I like that.

3208
02:41:48,640 --> 02:41:50,980
We have...

3209
02:41:50,980 --> 02:41:52,800
For the small league...

3210
02:41:55,020 --> 02:41:56,380
Team S...

3211
02:41:56,380 --> 02:41:57,700
I feel like...

3212
02:41:59,300 --> 02:42:01,180
Little itty-bitty league.

3213
02:42:03,900 --> 02:42:05,180
We have...

3214
02:42:06,760 --> 02:42:13,740
Those who are babies, Team S Major as our winner versus Team Shubble.

3215
02:42:14,060 --> 02:42:18,880
And then Team TMC as our winner versus Team Snipperish.

3216
02:42:21,080 --> 02:42:23,960
Which I was like, um, it's average size.

3217
02:42:28,520 --> 02:42:32,480
I actually think it's quite a big league, if I'm being honest with you.

3218
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,780
I think it's above average league.

3219
02:42:35,880 --> 02:42:40,400
We're talking so much shit and we wouldn't be able to last like two seconds if we were...

3220
02:42:40,400 --> 02:42:46,360
I think in this matchup we can absolutely destroy it.

3221
02:42:48,840 --> 02:42:52,080
Unless the admins give us like creative motor or something.

3222
02:42:52,100 --> 02:42:53,820
But hey, we're the casters.

3223
02:42:54,080 --> 02:42:55,680
We're just here to let you know.

3224
02:42:56,260 --> 02:42:58,120
Casters are the best players.

3225
02:42:58,280 --> 02:42:59,320
Look at other esports.

3226
02:42:59,960 --> 02:43:01,060
Oh, I shouldn't say that.

3227
02:43:01,440 --> 02:43:01,840
Oh.

3228
02:43:03,120 --> 02:43:03,800
Oh, fine.

3229
02:43:03,880 --> 02:43:04,020
What?

3230
02:43:04,060 --> 02:43:05,420
You're calling me not the best player?

3231
02:43:05,500 --> 02:43:06,080
Okay, that's fine.

3232
02:43:06,360 --> 02:43:08,360
You guys can be rude and nasty to the pro.

3233
02:43:09,080 --> 02:43:09,680
It's fine.

3234
02:43:09,780 --> 02:43:10,480
No, you guys are right.

3235
02:43:11,520 --> 02:43:12,640
What do you mean?

3236
02:43:12,740 --> 02:43:14,220
Yeah, you're literally casting.

3237
02:43:15,760 --> 02:43:18,020
When are you gonna get into the match?

3238
02:43:18,320 --> 02:43:18,380
Huh?

3239
02:43:18,720 --> 02:43:20,780
Get in the match, huh?

3240
02:43:21,240 --> 02:43:22,900
Hey, ask the admins, bro.

3241
02:43:23,960 --> 02:43:25,540
It's because I'm washed, I think.

3242
02:43:28,040 --> 02:43:28,920
This guy...

3243
02:43:28,920 --> 02:43:30,640
No, we're not letting him in.

3244
02:43:31,020 --> 02:43:32,000
He's too good.

3245
02:43:32,100 --> 02:43:33,520
He wouldn't let the teams be balanced.

3246
02:43:33,960 --> 02:43:36,400
That's why you're a Minecraft professional analyst.

3247
02:43:36,820 --> 02:43:38,340
He's all speed, no skill.

3248
02:43:38,680 --> 02:43:40,400
You just know way too much.

3249
02:43:40,620 --> 02:43:42,640
That it just wouldn't be fair if you were part of the games.

3250
02:43:43,460 --> 02:43:44,340
Right, like...

3251
02:43:44,900 --> 02:43:46,320
Stop gassing him up.

3252
02:43:48,800 --> 02:43:50,580
Sorry, you can take him down a peg.

3253
02:43:50,580 --> 02:43:52,780
You're allowed to, don't worry.

3254
02:43:52,980 --> 02:43:54,420
We're doing good cop, bad cop.

3255
02:43:54,460 --> 02:43:55,800
It's your turn to be bad cop.

3256
02:43:57,620 --> 02:43:58,080
British!

3257
02:43:59,540 --> 02:44:00,000
No!

3258
02:44:01,020 --> 02:44:01,480
No!

3259
02:44:02,140 --> 02:44:02,600
No!

3260
02:44:05,720 --> 02:44:06,440
It's okay.

3261
02:44:06,640 --> 02:44:08,580
I will always have the British curse.

3262
02:44:08,840 --> 02:44:11,520
That's something I have to deal with for the rest of my life.

3263
02:44:12,040 --> 02:44:13,960
You can always leave.

3264
02:44:16,360 --> 02:44:19,040
No matter where I go, the British curse will follow.

3265
02:44:19,040 --> 02:44:19,600
That's...

3266
02:44:19,600 --> 02:44:23,240
You can pretend to be Australian.

3267
02:44:24,540 --> 02:44:24,920
Cute.

3268
02:44:26,360 --> 02:44:27,680
Then you'd be Australian.

3269
02:44:28,480 --> 02:44:28,980
Oh my god.

3270
02:44:30,680 --> 02:44:32,600
I'm excited for this map.

3271
02:44:32,780 --> 02:44:35,400
We are at Meow Meow Manor, everybody.

3272
02:44:39,200 --> 02:44:42,220
Oh my god.

3273
02:44:42,660 --> 02:44:43,820
What a big boy.

3274
02:44:45,700 --> 02:44:46,140
What a big boy.

3275
02:44:46,140 --> 02:44:47,860
I think that this...

3276
02:44:47,860 --> 02:44:49,240
What a big, big boy.

3277
02:44:51,300 --> 02:44:52,260
Oh my god, more cats.

3278
02:44:54,500 --> 02:44:56,000
Where is the...

3279
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:57,860
Oh, I guess the dragon is down there.

3280
02:44:58,040 --> 02:44:58,180
Okay.

3281
02:44:58,840 --> 02:45:00,920
They're just watching over the cats.

3282
02:45:01,440 --> 02:45:03,900
Oh, I wonder if you can drop...

3283
02:45:03,900 --> 02:45:05,520
I don't think you can drop down, right?

3284
02:45:05,900 --> 02:45:06,500
There's no way.

3285
02:45:07,820 --> 02:45:09,700
Oh, there's definitely little pods down here.

3286
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:10,340
Look at this.

3287
02:45:10,340 --> 02:45:11,500
There's loads of hiding spots.

3288
02:45:11,500 --> 02:45:12,600
Oh, apparently this is a new map.

3289
02:45:14,120 --> 02:45:16,780
So we're getting a first look at it.

3290
02:45:16,920 --> 02:45:17,300
Wow.

3291
02:45:17,400 --> 02:45:20,820
We're getting a first exclusive look right here on this channel.

3292
02:45:21,580 --> 02:45:23,100
I think that the...

3293
02:45:25,480 --> 02:45:27,220
I think that the admins...

3294
02:45:27,220 --> 02:45:29,580
The admins must be cat people, right?

3295
02:45:29,640 --> 02:45:32,460
Because the new map, that's cat manor.

3296
02:45:32,680 --> 02:45:33,740
Meow Meow Manor, right?

3297
02:45:34,420 --> 02:45:34,980
And...

3298
02:45:34,980 --> 02:45:38,380
The new hero or the new character...

3299
02:45:39,520 --> 02:45:39,960
Harmony.

3300
02:45:40,860 --> 02:45:41,480
Harmony, right?

3301
02:45:41,680 --> 02:45:42,920
And Harmony has a cat.

3302
02:45:43,340 --> 02:45:46,120
Rascal is kind of the MVP.

3303
02:45:46,860 --> 02:45:48,580
Yeah, no, Rascal is the MVP for real.

3304
02:45:48,600 --> 02:45:49,820
Harmony is just a plus one.

3305
02:45:50,280 --> 02:45:51,560
Rascal is where we're at.

3306
02:45:52,020 --> 02:45:52,900
Rascal is the OG.

3307
02:45:53,480 --> 02:45:56,260
Oh my gosh, I love the way they did the drapes and everything.

3308
02:45:56,520 --> 02:45:57,280
That's so...

3309
02:45:57,280 --> 02:45:57,920
It looks so good.

3310
02:45:58,120 --> 02:46:00,040
Are you writing it down for your next build?

3311
02:46:00,100 --> 02:46:02,680
Yeah, I'm getting inspo right now.

3312
02:46:05,620 --> 02:46:06,500
This is beautiful.

3313
02:46:06,500 --> 02:46:07,880
This is a really good map.

3314
02:46:07,980 --> 02:46:10,780
Thank you to everyone who did the behind the scenes stuff.

3315
02:46:10,880 --> 02:46:14,220
I know there's a billion, grillion people that have worked on everything.

3316
02:46:14,640 --> 02:46:15,800
I assume so.

3317
02:46:16,020 --> 02:46:19,600
It looks so intricate and so detailed in general.

3318
02:46:20,540 --> 02:46:20,960
For real.

3319
02:46:21,320 --> 02:46:22,800
Oh my god, there's a secret tunnel.

3320
02:46:23,120 --> 02:46:24,140
Secret tunnel.

3321
02:46:25,500 --> 02:46:26,720
This is huge.

3322
02:46:27,200 --> 02:46:30,300
There's so many of these little hiding spots in different places.

3323
02:46:30,760 --> 02:46:32,360
And it's a 5v5, dude.

3324
02:46:32,480 --> 02:46:34,300
I feel like the one man strut works.

3325
02:46:34,300 --> 02:46:36,540
This is a big map for 5v5.

3326
02:46:39,120 --> 02:46:40,420
They're like tiny.

3327
02:46:40,880 --> 02:46:41,280
Look how tiny they are.

3328
02:46:41,360 --> 02:46:43,000
They're like little mice.

3329
02:46:44,300 --> 02:46:47,220
They're like little mice just running around.

3330
02:46:48,860 --> 02:46:51,280
I think that's why the one man strut has been working so well.

3331
02:46:51,380 --> 02:46:53,580
It's such a big map and such a small team.

3332
02:46:53,700 --> 02:46:55,340
You can't defend it from all angles.

3333
02:46:55,780 --> 02:46:59,200
And Shatter, we've seen, killed that dragon twice now.

3334
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:01,020
In two different matches.

3335
02:47:01,140 --> 02:47:02,200
In that one man strut.

3336
02:47:02,800 --> 02:47:04,280
I wonder if he's going to be able to get it again.

3337
02:47:04,280 --> 02:47:05,180
I wonder if he can get away with this.

3338
02:47:05,260 --> 02:47:08,100
Because SmallAnt's team is a lot stronger.

3339
02:47:09,120 --> 02:47:09,420
And coordinated.

3340
02:47:10,100 --> 02:47:12,300
I think it's the biggest matchup we're going to see.

3341
02:47:12,380 --> 02:47:13,400
I think it's the most intense.

3342
02:47:13,780 --> 02:47:16,100
SmallAnt's team is very good at PvP too.

3343
02:47:16,300 --> 02:47:20,000
So I don't know if he's going to get away with it like the other teams.

3344
02:47:20,820 --> 02:47:21,560
But it is pretty.

3345
02:47:22,300 --> 02:47:23,320
It's a huge map.

3346
02:47:23,420 --> 02:47:25,200
Oh my gosh, there's so more.

3347
02:47:27,920 --> 02:47:28,320
God.

3348
02:47:28,960 --> 02:47:30,700
There's more to this map?

3349
02:47:30,700 --> 02:47:32,140
Oh my god.

3350
02:47:34,720 --> 02:47:36,600
Alright, but who is the mid boss though?

3351
02:47:37,640 --> 02:47:38,400
So true.

3352
02:47:39,380 --> 02:47:40,500
Don't let it be a cat.

3353
02:47:40,620 --> 02:47:41,780
It can't be a cat, right?

3354
02:47:42,080 --> 02:47:42,900
Maybe a mouse.

3355
02:47:43,380 --> 02:47:44,880
Maybe a giant mouse.

3356
02:47:46,180 --> 02:47:46,920
I like that.

3357
02:47:47,320 --> 02:47:48,420
Tom and Jerry style.

3358
02:47:50,300 --> 02:47:52,020
Look at the chandelier.

3359
02:47:52,180 --> 02:47:52,580
Wow.

3360
02:47:53,700 --> 02:47:54,880
This place is crazy.

3361
02:47:56,800 --> 02:47:59,160
You don't even look up really when you're playing.

3362
02:47:59,160 --> 02:48:00,020
But it's so beautiful.

3363
02:48:00,180 --> 02:48:02,220
The details and stuff.

3364
02:48:02,760 --> 02:48:03,940
We went all out with this one.

3365
02:48:05,520 --> 02:48:06,740
This is a really cool matchup.

3366
02:48:06,860 --> 02:48:09,960
If I had to describe these...

3367
02:48:09,960 --> 02:48:11,360
Minecraft analysis mode on.

3368
02:48:11,700 --> 02:48:12,280
Analyzer go.

3369
02:48:14,040 --> 02:48:16,500
Team SmallAnt is mostly speedrunners.

3370
02:48:16,880 --> 02:48:18,420
And that's why I think I know them so well.

3371
02:48:18,700 --> 02:48:20,620
I'm really good friends with most of the guys on that team.

3372
02:48:20,720 --> 02:48:22,780
That's why they're speeding through a lot of the games too.

3373
02:48:22,820 --> 02:48:24,460
And they've been winning super fast.

3374
02:48:24,660 --> 02:48:25,960
It kind of fits their brand.

3375
02:48:26,620 --> 02:48:29,720
But on the other team, it's team Lifesteal.

3376
02:48:30,040 --> 02:48:32,340
Now, most of these guys are on a server together.

3377
02:48:32,720 --> 02:48:34,660
Which is all about PvP.

3378
02:48:34,820 --> 02:48:35,560
They love...

3379
02:48:35,560 --> 02:48:39,700
The whole thing is killing each other and trying to steal each other's life.

3380
02:48:40,380 --> 02:48:41,840
That's why it's called Lifesteal.

3381
02:48:42,760 --> 02:48:49,960
So, if I had to be honest, I think that Hannah's team is going to be stronger in the combat side of things.

3382
02:48:50,560 --> 02:48:56,080
But it's weird because in some of the games that we've been watching, Hannah's team has had less kills.

3383
02:48:56,080 --> 02:48:58,440
So maybe they're trying to focus on strategy.

3384
02:48:58,620 --> 02:49:04,460
But I know that the speedrunner guys, they know the ins and outs of this game.

3385
02:49:04,540 --> 02:49:05,700
I'm sure they've checked the meta.

3386
02:49:06,180 --> 02:49:07,840
They know exactly what's the best.

3387
02:49:08,020 --> 02:49:10,280
I'm pretty sure they researched the hell out of this one.

3388
02:49:10,440 --> 02:49:10,900
Exactly.

3389
02:49:13,800 --> 02:49:19,420
I mean, I think that it's pretty telling that these guys are in the final.

3390
02:49:19,600 --> 02:49:24,160
I know that individually, amongst the teams, they're really good friends as well.

3391
02:49:24,160 --> 02:49:27,300
All five of the teams, they have good synergy.

3392
02:49:27,440 --> 02:49:28,480
They have good communications.

3393
02:49:28,700 --> 02:49:32,200
They're able to give advice and listen and talk really easily.

3394
02:49:32,780 --> 02:49:34,500
And maybe that wasn't true for some of the other teams.

3395
02:49:34,560 --> 02:49:36,120
And that's why we see these two in the final.

3396
02:49:37,100 --> 02:49:38,880
Dude, I'm just excited, okay?

3397
02:49:39,340 --> 02:49:40,640
I love these teams.

3398
02:49:40,920 --> 02:49:41,440
I'm so hyped.

3399
02:49:42,040 --> 02:49:46,080
They've been playing together in all these Minecraft tournaments for a long time now.

3400
02:49:46,180 --> 02:49:48,520
So the chemistry must be really tight right now.

3401
02:49:49,740 --> 02:49:51,320
Yeah, this isn't their first rodeo.

3402
02:49:51,320 --> 02:49:52,780
They've played these games before.

3403
02:49:54,420 --> 02:49:58,260
Team Hanna just needs to be more bloodthirsty.

3404
02:50:01,540 --> 02:50:05,520
I think that Team Hanna are better at the combat stuff.

3405
02:50:05,740 --> 02:50:06,820
So maybe they do need to use it to their advantage.

3406
02:50:06,820 --> 02:50:09,420
If the game goes too long, Hanna might win via time.

3407
02:50:10,680 --> 02:50:11,560
True, possibly.

3408
02:50:11,780 --> 02:50:15,900
Because Hanna's team is better when the games draw on longer.

3409
02:50:16,120 --> 02:50:17,960
Because they're really good at defense, what I've noticed.

3410
02:50:18,820 --> 02:50:22,980
Just because they literally depend on one person for offense.

3411
02:50:24,140 --> 02:50:24,200
True.

3412
02:50:24,880 --> 02:50:27,780
And the SmallAnt's team are much more attacking.

3413
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:29,320
They go way faster.

3414
02:50:29,800 --> 02:50:31,480
Yeah, they really do.

3415
02:50:31,960 --> 02:50:36,160
It depends on if the game draws on too long or not.

3416
02:50:36,540 --> 02:50:42,840
Because the thing is though, Hanna and Sparkle's team was a very close match.

3417
02:50:43,540 --> 02:50:44,580
It was, right?

3418
02:50:45,160 --> 02:50:48,500
But SmallAnt demolished Sparkle's team.

3419
02:50:48,640 --> 02:50:51,480
It sounds like they got through that match a lot faster, right?

3420
02:50:52,500 --> 02:50:56,240
Apparently they got the first tower within 5 minutes, which is crazy.

3421
02:50:56,500 --> 02:50:57,320
Yeah, that's insane.

3422
02:50:57,620 --> 02:51:02,640
I really want to know how important that middle boss is for these winners.

3423
02:51:02,980 --> 02:51:10,160
I know that the matches that we've watched, sometimes that GumGum or the equivalent of which...

3424
02:51:10,160 --> 02:51:12,300
GumGum or...

3425
02:51:12,300 --> 02:51:13,120
ForeverGumGum!

3426
02:51:13,120 --> 02:51:14,340
I'm not even calling it mid-boss.

3427
02:51:14,520 --> 02:51:15,420
It's GumGum.

3428
02:51:17,520 --> 02:51:20,880
I don't know how important that GumGum is, right?

3429
02:51:21,180 --> 02:51:22,720
Maybe it's... Is it crucial?

3430
02:51:23,060 --> 02:51:24,320
Or is it just kind of a distraction?

3431
02:51:25,240 --> 02:51:26,600
It's the money, right?

3432
02:51:26,900 --> 02:51:27,660
It's more money.

3433
02:51:28,460 --> 02:51:32,140
That means they get more upgrades for it faster.

3434
02:51:32,840 --> 02:51:38,640
But then, will it work for them to their advantage with having a head start with the money situation?

3435
02:51:38,800 --> 02:51:41,020
Because you can't just farm creep to match it.

3436
02:51:41,600 --> 02:51:42,080
Yeah.

3437
02:51:42,320 --> 02:51:47,660
Maybe they don't even attack the mid-boss and they're just going for these zombies and these little mobs around the outside.

3438
02:51:48,060 --> 02:51:48,700
Is it equivalent?

3439
02:51:48,940 --> 02:51:49,760
Is it better?

3440
02:51:50,140 --> 02:51:54,160
I'm sure that these top two teams have their strategies locked down.

3441
02:51:54,340 --> 02:51:57,400
They've already played, what, four games already?

3442
02:51:57,800 --> 02:52:00,560
They better have their strategies locked down by then.

3443
02:52:00,720 --> 02:52:04,080
I think both of these teams have played four games and they've won all four.

3444
02:52:04,580 --> 02:52:07,500
Both of them are undefeated going into this final match.

3445
02:52:07,500 --> 02:52:17,680
For the middle, for the gum-gum boss, the winner gets 300 coins on killing that guy.

3446
02:52:18,400 --> 02:52:19,180
That is pretty good.

3447
02:52:19,560 --> 02:52:24,140
We haven't seen really anyone getting, I feel, any armor upgrades?

3448
02:52:24,200 --> 02:52:25,160
At least they're not visual.

3449
02:52:26,120 --> 02:52:27,880
I think it's like, I don't think it's a visual thing.

3450
02:52:28,060 --> 02:52:28,540
I'm pretty sure.

3451
02:52:28,740 --> 02:52:32,400
I think it's like as long as you go.

3452
02:52:32,400 --> 02:52:35,040
Otherwise it's a beautiful load of cosmetics.

3453
02:52:35,040 --> 02:52:35,800
True.

3454
02:52:37,460 --> 02:52:38,460
So, you know.

3455
02:52:38,760 --> 02:52:41,140
All those coins can really impact all the upgrades.

3456
02:52:41,140 --> 02:52:43,720
300 coins is a lot of coins in general.

3457
02:52:44,120 --> 02:52:47,160
Have you seen teams one without it though?

3458
02:52:47,540 --> 02:52:51,060
You can go from a diamond sword to a netherite sword with 450 coins.

3459
02:52:51,380 --> 02:52:52,040
So, you know, it's like.

3460
02:52:52,060 --> 02:52:52,900
Oh, that's a lot.

3461
02:52:53,220 --> 02:52:54,080
That's like, yeah.

3462
02:52:54,540 --> 02:52:56,440
So, you know that's pretty big.

3463
02:52:56,500 --> 02:52:56,600
Wait, is that the big boss?

3464
02:52:56,740 --> 02:52:57,460
The oracle?

3465
02:52:57,860 --> 02:52:58,840
Nah, that's not fun.

3466
02:52:59,300 --> 02:53:00,720
Wait, I didn't see him.

3467
02:53:01,120 --> 02:53:01,840
Yeah, it's just him.

3468
02:53:01,840 --> 02:53:03,020
Come on.

3469
02:53:04,580 --> 02:53:05,640
Devs, you heard that?

3470
02:53:05,780 --> 02:53:06,200
Change it.

3471
02:53:07,120 --> 02:53:08,080
Right now.

3472
02:53:08,740 --> 02:53:09,780
It's meow meow mana.

3473
02:53:09,980 --> 02:53:10,140
Hello?

3474
02:53:10,580 --> 02:53:12,220
Like, the enemy should be a mouse.

3475
02:53:13,100 --> 02:53:16,340
Look at the little mice that are fighting the little mom mice.

3476
02:53:16,960 --> 02:53:17,940
Oh, they're all mice.

3477
02:53:18,040 --> 02:53:18,460
Okay, cool.

3478
02:53:19,800 --> 02:53:21,080
Oh my god.

3479
02:53:21,180 --> 02:53:26,120
Oh, they got and fine bird gets one back.

3480
02:53:26,260 --> 02:53:29,380
It's one killer piece for these guys so far.

3481
02:53:29,720 --> 02:53:31,580
Dude, that's 100 coins for the witch?

3482
02:53:31,740 --> 02:53:32,880
That's a really good strategy.

3483
02:53:32,960 --> 02:53:35,000
It looks like these guys might know.

3484
02:53:35,720 --> 02:53:37,900
You just kill three witches and it'll be over.

3485
02:53:39,380 --> 02:53:39,820
Oh.

3486
02:53:40,400 --> 02:53:41,980
Fine bird getting 3v1'd.

3487
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:43,220
He cannot handle that.

3488
02:53:45,040 --> 02:53:45,520
Pyromaniac.

3489
02:53:46,200 --> 02:53:49,460
Blue team is just traveling in a group and stuff.

3490
02:53:49,680 --> 02:53:50,420
Trying to catch them.

3491
02:53:50,760 --> 02:53:56,360
I think they know that red team is mostly like all solos trying to farm as much as they can individually.

3492
02:53:56,740 --> 02:53:58,940
So, they're trying to catch them off guard.

3493
02:53:59,720 --> 02:54:01,280
Especially with the map so big.

3494
02:54:01,880 --> 02:54:02,480
It doesn't know!

3495
02:54:04,040 --> 02:54:06,480
How important does that even matter?

3496
02:54:07,580 --> 02:54:13,520
I think silver is just going for coins there so a death isn't really that important I feel.

3497
02:54:13,780 --> 02:54:14,440
Maybe I'm wrong.

3498
02:54:14,440 --> 02:54:15,780
Maybe this is gonna be huge.

3499
02:54:16,100 --> 02:54:17,300
True, of course.

3500
02:54:17,500 --> 02:54:24,280
I feel like it's not worth it because maybe the first death or two but after that they gotta be really careful because the timer keeps increasing.

3501
02:54:24,280 --> 02:54:24,980
Exactly.

3502
02:54:26,560 --> 02:54:27,600
Oh my god, there they go.

3503
02:54:27,680 --> 02:54:29,300
They're going for the oracle.

3504
02:54:30,800 --> 02:54:33,060
It's like a giant square.

3505
02:54:33,460 --> 02:54:35,120
Oh, that is quite cool to be fair.

3506
02:54:35,640 --> 02:54:37,280
It's just a giant square.

3507
02:54:38,760 --> 02:54:42,020
No, it looks like that one thing.

3508
02:54:42,440 --> 02:54:43,300
The beam thing.

3509
02:54:43,360 --> 02:54:44,240
Yeah, the beam thing.

3510
02:54:46,020 --> 02:54:47,560
What is the beam thing?

3511
02:54:47,640 --> 02:54:48,860
It's a beacon, right?

3512
02:54:50,760 --> 02:54:52,340
That's why we have you here.

3513
02:54:52,340 --> 02:54:53,600
That's what I'm here for.

3514
02:54:53,800 --> 02:54:57,740
The technical term, the scientific term of this creature.

3515
02:54:59,300 --> 02:55:00,580
Of this Minecraft item.

3516
02:55:02,340 --> 02:55:04,860
We already see Hana's team being very aggressive.

3517
02:55:05,800 --> 02:55:08,820
This has been the most aggressive I've ever seen Hana's team.

3518
02:55:09,180 --> 02:55:10,800
I think that's what they need to do.

3519
02:55:10,940 --> 02:55:15,800
I think that's the right strategy for them because they are stronger when it comes to combat.

3520
02:55:16,240 --> 02:55:20,340
You can see Shratta is probably gonna take out...

3521
02:55:20,340 --> 02:55:20,660
Rattles?

3522
02:55:20,660 --> 02:55:22,080
I think that's Rattles.

3523
02:55:22,260 --> 02:55:24,880
Oh, Rattles got the 2v1.

3524
02:55:25,420 --> 02:55:26,060
Come on, Rad.

3525
02:55:26,540 --> 02:55:29,020
And he barely lost any HP for that too.

3526
02:55:29,460 --> 02:55:30,600
That's my goat right there.

3527
02:55:32,320 --> 02:55:35,600
Can we refrain from biases on the table?

3528
02:55:37,180 --> 02:55:38,120
Okay, okay.

3529
02:55:38,120 --> 02:55:38,780
Sorry, my fault.

3530
02:55:38,880 --> 02:55:40,000
I shouldn't be biased.

3531
02:55:40,380 --> 02:55:41,560
You should head... Oh wait, no.

3532
02:55:41,780 --> 02:55:43,300
He's not CaptainSparklez.

3533
02:55:43,400 --> 02:55:47,680
I was gonna say you should head over there and interrupt them again but that's not CaptainSparklez.

3534
02:55:47,680 --> 02:55:48,880
He's in the 3rd place playoff.

3535
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:50,600
I gotta keep a track on that.

3536
02:55:52,020 --> 02:55:55,620
If he wins the 3rd place playoff, I'm running in there and jumping on him.

3537
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:56,020
Do it!

3538
02:55:59,700 --> 02:56:01,720
It depends on how long that match goes on for.

3539
02:56:01,780 --> 02:56:10,220
Maybe we'll be able to see it if TeamSquallant is able to speedrun their way out of this but it looks like the blue team are getting a lot of kills.

3540
02:56:10,660 --> 02:56:12,200
But to be fair, they're always 2v1ing.

3541
02:56:12,320 --> 02:56:17,700
I don't see... They lose the 1v1 but they win majority of the 2v1s.

3542
02:56:17,700 --> 02:56:18,480
Yeah, that's true.

3543
02:56:18,520 --> 02:56:25,760
Rattles was able to take one of those 2v1s but most of them, you're right, they're going in the direction of Hanna's team.

3544
02:56:25,780 --> 02:56:26,700
They're all grouping up and stuff.

3545
02:56:27,020 --> 02:56:33,420
Hanna's team is just grouping up for kills while SmallAnt's team is all so separated and split up.

3546
02:56:33,420 --> 02:56:34,280
Two reds though.

3547
02:56:34,320 --> 02:56:36,060
Two reds pushing in on Kaboodle here.

3548
02:56:36,540 --> 02:56:38,420
I don't know if she's gonna be able to hold them off here.

3549
02:56:38,720 --> 02:56:39,740
She gets silver!

3550
02:56:41,400 --> 02:56:42,920
And Cam gets both!

3551
02:56:43,740 --> 02:56:46,100
Damn, these 1v2s are crazy!

3552
02:56:48,320 --> 02:56:49,420
I don't know.

3553
02:56:49,680 --> 02:56:52,860
SmallAnt's team, they're gonna keep accumulating deaths.

3554
02:56:53,160 --> 02:56:54,760
You know, it's gonna be rough for them.

3555
02:56:54,760 --> 02:56:56,340
Maybe they're getting a lot of coins right now.

3556
02:56:56,420 --> 02:56:56,880
We don't know.

3557
02:56:57,180 --> 02:56:59,600
We can't tell about the currency and the mana and stuff.

3558
02:57:01,040 --> 02:57:03,160
So maybe they're just farming creep like you say.

3559
02:57:03,400 --> 02:57:06,800
Yeah, but like getting kills also gives you gold, I assume.

3560
02:57:07,100 --> 02:57:08,800
True, you're probably right.

3561
02:57:09,360 --> 02:57:10,020
I'm pretty sure.

3562
02:57:10,300 --> 02:57:12,700
Majority of MOBAs is like that, so...

3563
02:57:12,700 --> 02:57:16,820
I'm pretty sure getting kills is also very important as well.

3564
02:57:17,220 --> 02:57:20,140
And if you get kills on late game, you get more gold.

3565
02:57:21,140 --> 02:57:22,600
Feinberg, she's behind you!

3566
02:57:22,800 --> 02:57:23,660
Hannah's behind you!

3567
02:57:24,240 --> 02:57:24,720
Oh!

3568
02:57:26,560 --> 02:57:30,400
Dude, I've got a live feed to Feinberg's ear.

3569
02:57:30,540 --> 02:57:31,200
What the heck?

3570
02:57:31,280 --> 02:57:31,940
How did he know?

3571
02:57:33,420 --> 02:57:34,980
Oh my god, he got the kill.

3572
02:57:35,200 --> 02:57:38,380
I wonder if you can't hear the footsteps very well.

3573
02:57:38,380 --> 02:57:41,760
Or like, they have an ability to mute the footsteps.

3574
02:57:41,760 --> 02:57:44,120
I know that these speedrunners have definitely got...

3575
02:57:44,120 --> 02:57:46,620
You know when you first start the game?

3576
02:57:46,940 --> 02:57:49,940
He comes up and says like, turn this on for narrator.

3577
02:57:50,200 --> 02:57:52,000
So it like speaks out what it is you're doing.

3578
02:57:52,320 --> 02:57:55,440
There's another accessibility setting that gives you subtitles.

3579
02:57:55,920 --> 02:57:57,140
Oh yeah, that went on.

3580
02:57:57,540 --> 02:58:01,700
So you can see the footsteps and maybe that was what he used there.

3581
02:58:01,800 --> 02:58:04,540
In that corner you're able to see, oh, footsteps behind you.

3582
02:58:04,700 --> 02:58:06,320
Oh, that means there's a person there.

3583
02:58:06,320 --> 02:58:08,600
Maybe he's able to use that.

3584
02:58:09,160 --> 02:58:11,340
Does everyone not play with the subtitles on?

3585
02:58:11,460 --> 02:58:12,900
I play with it on.

3586
02:58:13,060 --> 02:58:15,080
I think that's smart to do.

3587
02:58:15,240 --> 02:58:16,460
I definitely play with them on.

3588
02:58:16,720 --> 02:58:20,320
I don't know, but these guys probably just started with a new...

3589
02:58:20,960 --> 02:58:21,020
Ooh!

3590
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:23,040
Feinberg takes a death.

3591
02:58:23,840 --> 02:58:25,780
I think that's Feinberg's ult, right?

3592
02:58:27,100 --> 02:58:28,920
I think that might have been Pangy's.

3593
02:58:29,560 --> 02:58:31,300
Pangy's the fire guy.

3594
02:58:32,080 --> 02:58:33,320
No, no, he didn't ult.

3595
02:58:33,780 --> 02:58:35,520
Wait, what?

3596
02:58:35,680 --> 02:58:36,440
That was Feinberg?

3597
02:58:36,520 --> 02:58:38,720
That was an item or ability.

3598
02:58:38,740 --> 02:58:40,020
Maybe it was one of the lower tier ones.

3599
02:58:40,100 --> 02:58:41,120
Yeah, the abilities, right?

3600
02:58:42,340 --> 02:58:44,900
That's another kill for Hanna's team.

3601
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:47,000
They've just been killing non-stop.

3602
02:58:47,260 --> 02:58:48,120
I know, it's kind of...

3603
02:58:48,120 --> 02:58:51,420
I haven't seen any kills from small...

3604
02:58:51,420 --> 02:58:55,340
Oh, I mean, there's one right now, but I feel like the majority of the kills were on Hanna's team.

3605
02:58:55,480 --> 02:58:55,880
Yeah.

3606
02:58:57,720 --> 02:58:59,060
They're not letting them farm.

3607
02:58:59,260 --> 02:59:00,620
They're not letting them...

3608
02:59:00,620 --> 02:59:03,920
They're also increasing their time to come back.

3609
02:59:04,220 --> 02:59:05,160
This is smart.

3610
02:59:06,340 --> 02:59:11,520
It's elongating the game as well, which we've seen Hanna's team's doing so much better in those longer games.

3611
02:59:11,640 --> 02:59:15,380
They're able to farm a lot more, get more coins, get more advantage.

3612
02:59:16,660 --> 02:59:20,620
I think if these teams are evenly matched, I'd always back blue team.

3613
02:59:20,800 --> 02:59:23,500
I'd back Hanna's team in just a raw 1v1.

3614
02:59:23,880 --> 02:59:26,540
I think their combat skills are much better.

3615
02:59:27,280 --> 02:59:27,880
Yeah, they did it.

3616
02:59:27,880 --> 02:59:29,760
Judging... Looking at this, yeah.

3617
02:59:30,100 --> 02:59:31,740
I honestly thought like...

3618
02:59:31,740 --> 02:59:41,640
I thought that Feinberg's team was gonna just roll over them, but they're making a very evenly matched right now.

3619
02:59:42,020 --> 02:59:47,620
And we've seen in previous matches that SmallAnt's team goes in very quickly, and they don't have a chance to here.

3620
02:59:47,740 --> 02:59:49,200
It's no damage.

3621
02:59:49,400 --> 02:59:50,460
No damage at all.

3622
02:59:51,680 --> 02:59:53,700
7 minutes in, 0 damage.

3623
02:59:54,900 --> 02:59:56,580
But now, they haven't yet.

3624
02:59:57,560 --> 02:59:58,440
Which is interesting.

3625
02:59:58,640 --> 03:00:01,060
Maybe the Oracle is gonna swing it in red team's favor.

3626
03:00:01,220 --> 03:00:09,940
If they're able to get a few kills here, and then maybe take out that mid boss, maybe they'll be able to come back and start farming some better gear.

3627
03:00:11,200 --> 03:00:16,740
I think that if that's not gonna be the case, if blue take out this mid boss...

3628
03:00:16,740 --> 03:00:18,300
Blue is getting the Oracle right now.

3629
03:00:20,560 --> 03:00:21,520
Look out below!

3630
03:00:21,520 --> 03:00:22,260
Look out below!

3631
03:00:22,900 --> 03:00:24,220
Look out below!

3632
03:00:25,100 --> 03:00:27,540
Red team were able to kind of avoid that stun though.

3633
03:00:28,380 --> 03:00:29,060
Oh, dude!

3634
03:00:29,240 --> 03:00:31,500
Look at how quickly they're taking out the damage though!

3635
03:00:32,880 --> 03:00:33,840
Hannah's destroying!

3636
03:00:34,360 --> 03:00:35,560
I think that's her ultimate.

3637
03:00:35,560 --> 03:00:36,460
Oh, but Hannah dies!

3638
03:00:36,800 --> 03:00:41,460
If red team can crit it out right now, and there's no one to defend it!

3639
03:00:41,640 --> 03:00:42,680
Oh, run back!

3640
03:00:43,320 --> 03:00:44,980
Come on, Silver!

3641
03:00:45,960 --> 03:00:47,360
And Silver takes it out!

3642
03:00:47,780 --> 03:00:49,440
That's my underdog right there.

3643
03:00:49,440 --> 03:00:50,960
That's my hidden gem.

3644
03:00:52,020 --> 03:00:53,180
It's all that matter.

3645
03:00:53,300 --> 03:00:54,140
All of the coins.

3646
03:00:54,440 --> 03:00:56,360
That was a good example of the ult though.

3647
03:00:56,840 --> 03:00:59,280
Yeah, it looked like he was using a macro there.

3648
03:00:59,740 --> 03:01:00,520
I know!

3649
03:01:01,140 --> 03:01:03,200
It looked like that cookie clicker macro.

3650
03:01:06,080 --> 03:01:07,660
Now I think it's pretty even.

3651
03:01:08,180 --> 03:01:08,800
Red have got...

3652
03:01:08,800 --> 03:01:10,500
Red can get so many upgrades now.

3653
03:01:10,700 --> 03:01:11,440
What are you trying to say?

3654
03:01:16,870 --> 03:01:18,290
What are you trying to confess?

3655
03:01:18,470 --> 03:01:18,750
I don't know.

3656
03:01:28,370 --> 03:01:32,950
Red got the upgrades, but nothing is happening so far.

3657
03:01:34,150 --> 03:01:38,010
I don't know how important those upgrades are, but Red gets another kill there as well.

3658
03:01:38,370 --> 03:01:41,270
My chat said it's a whole entire upgrade for a team.

3659
03:01:41,810 --> 03:01:44,050
It actually does a lot.

3660
03:01:46,250 --> 03:01:48,710
300 coins could definitely get you...

3661
03:01:48,710 --> 03:01:51,730
Yeah, 300 coins would get you from sharpness 1 to sharpness 2.

3662
03:01:52,230 --> 03:01:55,190
That's more important than a single upgrade individually.

3663
03:01:56,050 --> 03:02:00,670
Because a sharpness 2 iron sword is better than a sharpness 1 diamond sword.

3664
03:02:01,070 --> 03:02:02,650
That's massive actually.

3665
03:02:02,930 --> 03:02:04,830
I like how his teammate just ignored him.

3666
03:02:08,370 --> 03:02:11,170
He turned around way too late.

3667
03:02:13,050 --> 03:02:15,050
Finally we are seeing some tower damage.

3668
03:02:15,230 --> 03:02:17,130
And Blue's tower is getting damaged here.

3669
03:02:17,670 --> 03:02:19,370
So Red are taking attack here.

3670
03:02:20,030 --> 03:02:20,730
Just a little bit.

3671
03:02:20,850 --> 03:02:22,890
Just a chip, but you know, it's something.

3672
03:02:23,530 --> 03:02:24,490
10 minutes in.

3673
03:02:27,230 --> 03:02:29,890
Hey, anything is helpful at this point.

3674
03:02:29,950 --> 03:02:30,650
I know, yeah.

3675
03:02:30,870 --> 03:02:32,970
In 2 minutes, all the towers are going to get damaged.

3676
03:02:33,390 --> 03:02:39,570
Yeah, I was going to say at this point, it's going to be anyone's game, honestly.

3677
03:02:41,310 --> 03:02:42,950
Yeah, it's weight is really close.

3678
03:02:43,350 --> 03:02:48,170
It definitely gets much more exciting when all the towers get damaged.

3679
03:02:49,470 --> 03:02:50,550
It's just not a lot.

3680
03:02:50,550 --> 03:02:53,210
But just really quick to destroy a tower at that point.

3681
03:02:54,050 --> 03:02:55,370
It gets super duper close.

3682
03:02:56,690 --> 03:02:59,130
I mean, these teams are pretty much neck and neck right now.

3683
03:02:59,210 --> 03:03:01,470
They've not lost a game for the whole time.

3684
03:03:01,630 --> 03:03:02,390
I love that.

3685
03:03:02,430 --> 03:03:06,350
I love that we're seeing the best of the best play against each other.

3686
03:03:06,870 --> 03:03:07,150
Yeah.

3687
03:03:10,090 --> 03:03:13,470
And right now, I honestly thought maybe one team would have already won.

3688
03:03:13,710 --> 03:03:16,550
Or one team would have been at least significantly ahead.

3689
03:03:16,670 --> 03:03:19,210
But there's no real, there's no huge advantage.

3690
03:03:19,210 --> 03:03:23,570
And sure, red have a little bit of damage, but that can be done in two seconds by blue team.

3691
03:03:23,730 --> 03:03:25,610
I think they could easily make this comeback.

3692
03:03:25,910 --> 03:03:30,590
I'm so interested to see Hannah's team's player kill count.

3693
03:03:31,490 --> 03:03:32,070
Oh my god.

3694
03:03:32,490 --> 03:03:34,370
Hannah's team's just been killing everybody.

3695
03:03:34,630 --> 03:03:39,010
I'm curious how many kills their entire team has had so far.

3696
03:03:40,790 --> 03:03:44,750
I barely see red team getting the kills at the moment.

3697
03:03:44,850 --> 03:03:46,190
But they're still really close.

3698
03:03:46,190 --> 03:03:56,030
I think it's just because even if they're killing a lot, if blue team's killing a lot of them, someone in red team is farming a lot of gold for everybody.

3699
03:04:00,230 --> 03:04:03,450
Because I feel like with the amount of people...

3700
03:04:03,450 --> 03:04:04,910
Oh my god, there they go.

3701
03:04:06,130 --> 03:04:06,870
Oh, nice.

3702
03:04:08,330 --> 03:04:11,110
We got a little bit of the wither.

3703
03:04:11,190 --> 03:04:13,470
A fraction of the heart, I think.

3704
03:04:13,470 --> 03:04:13,990
True.

3705
03:04:17,090 --> 03:04:24,850
Because I feel like with the amount of people that blue team's been killing, they should be overrunning them, but yet they seem similar.

3706
03:04:26,090 --> 03:04:29,030
Similar skill-wise and gold-wise.

3707
03:04:31,190 --> 03:04:32,510
The hide strat.

3708
03:04:34,590 --> 03:04:35,230
What?

3709
03:04:35,450 --> 03:04:35,910
The boat?

3710
03:04:36,350 --> 03:04:37,890
Where did that come from?

3711
03:04:39,230 --> 03:04:40,590
Wait, there's a boat?

3712
03:04:40,590 --> 03:04:41,230
Yeah!

3713
03:04:42,090 --> 03:04:43,050
Who was that?

3714
03:04:43,230 --> 03:04:43,510
Feinberg?

3715
03:04:43,610 --> 03:04:44,830
He just pulled out a boat.

3716
03:04:46,210 --> 03:04:48,710
He's gonna run people over with a boat.

3717
03:04:49,070 --> 03:04:50,710
What does a boat even do?

3718
03:04:52,610 --> 03:04:54,090
Oh, there's another fight?

3719
03:04:55,430 --> 03:04:56,790
Oh, they lost the fight.

3720
03:04:58,570 --> 03:05:00,710
Ooh, small land's getting taken out here.

3721
03:05:00,770 --> 03:05:01,290
2v1.

3722
03:05:01,650 --> 03:05:06,050
I think if they take small land out, they can go for the towers at that point.

3723
03:05:07,110 --> 03:05:09,430
Wow, yeah, both teams have some damage here.

3724
03:05:09,530 --> 03:05:12,750
The biggest disadvantage is also this map is huge.

3725
03:05:12,890 --> 03:05:13,970
It's so big.

3726
03:05:14,330 --> 03:05:18,430
I feel like by the time they get to the tower, people would have already respawned too.

3727
03:05:26,850 --> 03:05:27,810
Oh no!

3728
03:05:32,110 --> 03:05:33,150
I think that was Feinberg.

3729
03:05:34,430 --> 03:05:35,590
I mean, it's a 1v2.

3730
03:05:35,650 --> 03:05:36,590
Oh, it's a 1v3.

3731
03:05:36,590 --> 03:05:38,270
Oh, he's like, I'm gonna get you.

3732
03:05:39,090 --> 03:05:40,230
I think someone pulled off.

3733
03:05:40,390 --> 03:05:41,450
I think they pulled out.

3734
03:05:41,890 --> 03:05:45,550
Yeah, because look, you can see another person heading in for it.

3735
03:05:46,010 --> 03:05:47,090
Feinberg's trying to distract.

3736
03:05:47,690 --> 03:05:48,890
ADHD kicking in.

3737
03:05:50,010 --> 03:05:53,030
No, I think it's good to go after the witches though, because they're big money.

3738
03:05:54,030 --> 03:05:55,370
It's just funny to see.

3739
03:05:55,590 --> 03:05:57,890
I know, it's like, I'm fighting, I'm fighting.

3740
03:05:58,110 --> 03:05:58,830
Oh, a witch.

3741
03:05:59,350 --> 03:06:00,310
Oh, a witch.

3742
03:06:01,470 --> 03:06:02,290
Oh, silver.

3743
03:06:02,290 --> 03:06:04,290
Hannah is strong.

3744
03:06:04,990 --> 03:06:05,590
She's scary.

3745
03:06:08,330 --> 03:06:09,070
A witch.

3746
03:06:09,930 --> 03:06:10,650
A witch.

3747
03:06:11,210 --> 03:06:13,450
The witches seem like they're pretty overpowered.

3748
03:06:13,590 --> 03:06:15,090
You get 100 coins if you kill one.

3749
03:06:15,230 --> 03:06:16,250
I know, that's what I'm saying.

3750
03:06:16,950 --> 03:06:18,430
Three witches equals an oracle.

3751
03:06:19,490 --> 03:06:19,810
Yeah.

3752
03:06:21,170 --> 03:06:22,890
It's worth going after them.

3753
03:06:23,370 --> 03:06:25,070
Yeah, that's why he's like, a witch.

3754
03:06:28,250 --> 03:06:29,950
I wonder how much gold you...

3755
03:06:29,950 --> 03:06:31,790
I guess it depends on how late game it is.

3756
03:06:31,890 --> 03:06:35,890
I was wondering how much gold you get for, like, player kills.

3757
03:06:40,110 --> 03:06:41,730
No, we don't really... Do we see that?

3758
03:06:41,830 --> 03:06:43,070
Does that pop up when they...

3759
03:06:43,070 --> 03:06:43,850
I don't know.

3760
03:06:44,670 --> 03:06:49,670
I don't know if you... You do get gold, right, for killing players?

3761
03:06:49,990 --> 03:06:52,270
Because usually MOBAs, you get gold for killing players.

3762
03:06:53,430 --> 03:06:56,310
Yeah, I think we get gold and aura per kill.

3763
03:06:56,570 --> 03:06:57,790
Yeah, yeah, because it depends on...

3764
03:06:57,790 --> 03:07:01,490
The more late game it is, the more gold you get because it's more upgraded and stuff.

3765
03:07:01,990 --> 03:07:03,890
These guys are hoarding their ults.

3766
03:07:03,990 --> 03:07:08,990
Look, four ults for team red and the blue team so close as well.

3767
03:07:09,150 --> 03:07:10,970
Oh my god, he just 1v2'd.

3768
03:07:11,270 --> 03:07:13,590
Oh, apparently it's plus 25 gold for players.

3769
03:07:13,650 --> 03:07:15,870
Oh, so there's no point in killing players.

3770
03:07:17,710 --> 03:07:19,210
I mean, there is a point, but like...

3771
03:07:19,790 --> 03:07:23,310
There is a point, but like, you get more gold from...

3772
03:07:23,310 --> 03:07:24,470
Shot has one manning.

3773
03:07:24,810 --> 03:07:27,210
We've seen it before and he's gonna do it again.

3774
03:07:29,650 --> 03:07:30,610
Get's taken out.

3775
03:07:30,770 --> 03:07:31,230
Rattles.

3776
03:07:31,930 --> 03:07:34,010
With the cap on her head, able to take him out.

3777
03:07:34,430 --> 03:07:35,390
Oh, they're getting one too.

3778
03:07:35,770 --> 03:07:36,190
Nice.

3779
03:07:37,030 --> 03:07:38,870
Okay, we got some action going on.

3780
03:07:38,990 --> 03:07:42,510
All three towers have just a bit of damage taken.

3781
03:07:43,870 --> 03:07:45,950
Red team's tower is almost down though.

3782
03:07:46,930 --> 03:07:47,770
It's like 25%.

3783
03:07:50,430 --> 03:07:52,010
I feel like there's more dam...

3784
03:07:52,010 --> 03:07:52,810
Oh my god.

3785
03:07:54,210 --> 03:07:55,150
Who was it?

3786
03:07:55,850 --> 03:07:56,610
What's his name?

3787
03:07:56,710 --> 03:07:58,130
The guy that did the other tower.

3788
03:07:59,870 --> 03:07:59,990
What?

3789
03:08:00,170 --> 03:08:00,430
Shatter?

3790
03:08:00,650 --> 03:08:01,650
Shatter was one manning.

3791
03:08:02,470 --> 03:08:05,150
Shatter's damage is insane compared to the others.

3792
03:08:07,150 --> 03:08:10,810
He almost got that tower to half HP while like...

3793
03:08:10,810 --> 03:08:11,650
Just by himself.

3794
03:08:12,050 --> 03:08:13,130
Yeah, just by himself.

3795
03:08:14,330 --> 03:08:16,970
Versus the red team trying to do the same thing.

3796
03:08:17,350 --> 03:08:21,590
I think it was Finebird that tried to take the tower and he only got a little bit of the percentage off.

3797
03:08:26,100 --> 03:08:27,800
This is a really long game.

3798
03:08:27,920 --> 03:08:32,260
And like we said at the start, the longer games are going to be favouring team blue.

3799
03:08:32,420 --> 03:08:33,580
But look at team red here.

3800
03:08:33,580 --> 03:08:35,900
They're doing big damage on two towers now.

3801
03:08:36,140 --> 03:08:36,620
Oh my god.

3802
03:08:36,840 --> 03:08:37,860
One on each tower.

3803
03:08:38,660 --> 03:08:39,840
Oh, they're all respawning.

3804
03:08:41,840 --> 03:08:43,320
That's one tower down.

3805
03:08:43,700 --> 03:08:44,780
Two towers down.

3806
03:08:45,940 --> 03:08:47,560
And there's all the respawns coming in.

3807
03:08:47,700 --> 03:08:48,900
Four respawns.

3808
03:08:49,220 --> 03:08:51,040
No one's getting silver.

3809
03:08:52,400 --> 03:08:54,060
They all have ults.

3810
03:08:54,120 --> 03:08:56,220
Wow, but that's a lot of damage.

3811
03:08:56,220 --> 03:08:57,280
That was huge.

3812
03:08:57,960 --> 03:08:59,620
Wait, when did they kill three?

3813
03:09:00,040 --> 03:09:01,740
They almost got a crystal too.

3814
03:09:02,200 --> 03:09:04,340
Wait, the one guy!

3815
03:09:06,540 --> 03:09:09,540
I think one guy's about to take down their one tower.

3816
03:09:15,660 --> 03:09:19,980
But they almost got two crystals out of that though from the red team.

3817
03:09:20,620 --> 03:09:22,200
When did they kill three?

3818
03:09:22,200 --> 03:09:23,440
I didn't even notice that.

3819
03:09:23,560 --> 03:09:24,440
Three of them were down.

3820
03:09:26,620 --> 03:09:28,460
That was a huge push.

3821
03:09:28,580 --> 03:09:30,560
Yeah, that was a huge push from the red team.

3822
03:09:31,080 --> 03:09:31,760
I didn't even notice.

3823
03:09:31,880 --> 03:09:32,280
Oh, witch!

3824
03:09:36,620 --> 03:09:38,100
I didn't even notice that.

3825
03:09:39,380 --> 03:09:41,340
I'm going to kill you.

3826
03:09:43,400 --> 03:09:45,580
Shatter is truly a...

3827
03:09:45,940 --> 03:09:47,280
He is a menace.

3828
03:09:48,400 --> 03:09:50,000
He's like, get over here.

3829
03:09:50,000 --> 03:09:51,860
I'm going to have rabbit stew.

3830
03:09:58,100 --> 03:10:01,980
I'm hearing a lot of shouts from my current next door neighbor.

3831
03:10:02,380 --> 03:10:03,220
I think it's positive.

3832
03:10:03,720 --> 03:10:04,180
He's cheering.

3833
03:10:04,380 --> 03:10:05,360
I don't think he's won yet.

3834
03:10:05,500 --> 03:10:07,840
Look at all the towers took damage.

3835
03:10:07,960 --> 03:10:08,920
They're half damage now.

3836
03:10:09,140 --> 03:10:09,300
Oh my gosh.

3837
03:10:10,980 --> 03:10:13,280
That kind of evens it back up, right?

3838
03:10:13,720 --> 03:10:14,420
Yeah, it does.

3839
03:10:15,860 --> 03:10:16,740
Pretty much.

3840
03:10:16,740 --> 03:10:16,820
Oh my gosh.

3841
03:10:17,700 --> 03:10:19,700
It felt like blue was...

3842
03:10:19,700 --> 03:10:21,100
Sorry, red was heavily in the lead.

3843
03:10:21,180 --> 03:10:23,480
And now the lead is being cut by quite a lot.

3844
03:10:23,740 --> 03:10:24,260
Yeah.

3845
03:10:26,840 --> 03:10:29,060
That's where the RNG kicks in.

3846
03:10:32,210 --> 03:10:33,670
No, it's all skill.

3847
03:10:36,770 --> 03:10:39,370
I thought that witch was someone coming for backup.

3848
03:10:39,730 --> 03:10:39,990
Nope.

3849
03:10:41,230 --> 03:10:42,090
A witch.

3850
03:10:43,050 --> 03:10:45,530
No time to go after the witch right now.

3851
03:10:45,530 --> 03:10:47,470
Look, turn around.

3852
03:10:47,630 --> 03:10:48,350
Oh, wow.

3853
03:10:48,850 --> 03:10:49,850
Oh my gosh.

3854
03:10:49,890 --> 03:10:50,790
I don't think he gets 1v3.

3855
03:10:50,790 --> 03:10:53,090
He's 1v3'd.

3856
03:10:53,110 --> 03:10:54,350
He's 1v3'd.

3857
03:10:55,870 --> 03:10:56,530
Oh my gosh.

3858
03:10:58,250 --> 03:10:58,930
Oh my gosh.

3859
03:11:01,430 --> 03:11:02,570
He got the crystal.

3860
03:11:02,770 --> 03:11:04,130
Even though he died, he got the crystal.

3861
03:11:04,670 --> 03:11:06,030
And there's a big...

3862
03:11:06,030 --> 03:11:06,990
That's the tower down.

3863
03:11:09,210 --> 03:11:10,450
There's still two more crystals.

3864
03:11:10,650 --> 03:11:12,010
Red gets the 1v1.

3865
03:11:12,710 --> 03:11:14,010
He might get this crystal.

3866
03:11:14,310 --> 03:11:15,910
Oh, it was so close.

3867
03:11:16,030 --> 03:11:16,790
So, so close.

3868
03:11:16,970 --> 03:11:18,330
She got it down to 1 HP.

3869
03:11:21,070 --> 03:11:22,970
Yeah, small land is not going to do a lot of damage here.

3870
03:11:23,010 --> 03:11:24,290
But it is drawing out a lot of players.

3871
03:11:24,590 --> 03:11:25,970
Can he get one hit off maybe?

3872
03:11:26,290 --> 03:11:26,970
One hit on a crystal.

3873
03:11:27,170 --> 03:11:27,690
Two hits.

3874
03:11:29,430 --> 03:11:30,190
That's helpful.

3875
03:11:32,270 --> 03:11:34,770
The crystals are literally one hit away from...

3876
03:11:34,770 --> 03:11:35,070
Oh my god.

3877
03:11:35,210 --> 03:11:37,790
The spawn time is a lot longer now.

3878
03:11:37,930 --> 03:11:38,930
It's like 20 seconds.

3879
03:11:39,410 --> 03:11:40,970
But to be fair, the map is so big.

3880
03:11:41,050 --> 03:11:42,470
By the time they get there...

3881
03:11:42,910 --> 03:11:44,270
They're basically respawning.

3882
03:11:45,630 --> 03:11:46,690
Look out below!

3883
03:11:47,990 --> 03:11:49,010
Look out below!

3884
03:11:50,750 --> 03:11:52,430
Oh, the oracle is back alive.

3885
03:11:52,690 --> 03:11:54,210
I guess someone could take out that mid-boss.

3886
03:11:54,430 --> 03:11:55,830
But it's kind of useless at this point.

3887
03:11:57,070 --> 03:11:59,190
It's definitely not worth it for team red.

3888
03:11:59,330 --> 03:12:02,830
Who only have to kill one tiny little crystal.

3889
03:12:03,310 --> 03:12:04,570
And Feinberg uses his ult.

3890
03:12:04,810 --> 03:12:06,450
And a lot of damage comes out.

3891
03:12:06,450 --> 03:12:07,930
Crystals down!

3892
03:12:10,250 --> 03:12:10,870
This is going to be it.

3893
03:12:11,130 --> 03:12:13,350
Feinberg is trying to defend the respawns.

3894
03:12:14,150 --> 03:12:16,230
Defending the respawns as best as he can.

3895
03:12:17,830 --> 03:12:18,530
10 HP!

3896
03:12:19,290 --> 03:12:19,950
It's over!

3897
03:12:22,490 --> 03:12:23,910
And it's over.

3898
03:12:25,250 --> 03:12:27,470
Team small ant takes the victory.

3899
03:12:36,590 --> 03:12:37,710
That's crazy.

3900
03:12:37,890 --> 03:12:38,870
Oh my god.

3901
03:12:39,610 --> 03:12:41,130
That was a crazy game.

3902
03:12:42,150 --> 03:12:43,390
It was so close too.

3903
03:12:43,530 --> 03:12:46,470
It's crazy to see.

3904
03:12:46,570 --> 03:12:47,770
Because Hanna's team...

3905
03:12:47,770 --> 03:12:50,170
I felt like Hanna's team did so well in kills.

3906
03:12:50,370 --> 03:12:51,290
But I'm pretty sure...

3907
03:12:51,290 --> 03:12:54,670
I'm pretty sure red team...

3908
03:12:54,970 --> 03:12:57,830
Was legit just farming creeps.

3909
03:12:57,890 --> 03:12:59,610
They didn't care about player kills.

3910
03:13:00,590 --> 03:13:02,230
That was crazy.

3911
03:13:02,790 --> 03:13:03,910
Which is so interesting.

3912
03:13:03,910 --> 03:13:07,510
Because it feels like that's exactly what Hanna's team did for the rest of the game.

3913
03:13:07,810 --> 03:13:09,670
They had less kills in a lot of these games.

3914
03:13:09,950 --> 03:13:11,990
But in this one...

3915
03:13:11,990 --> 03:13:13,410
Hanna's team got so many kills.

3916
03:13:13,570 --> 03:13:14,510
But it didn't really help.

3917
03:13:14,810 --> 03:13:16,170
This was such an important moment.

3918
03:13:16,490 --> 03:13:19,210
Where they were able to take out the oracle in the middle.

3919
03:13:21,110 --> 03:13:22,030
This round...

3920
03:13:22,030 --> 03:13:23,890
Team small ant has 54 kills.

3921
03:13:24,030 --> 03:13:25,430
And team Hanna had 35.

3922
03:13:25,910 --> 03:13:26,250
What?

3923
03:13:27,610 --> 03:13:29,010
Small ant got more kills?

3924
03:13:29,230 --> 03:13:29,990
I guess so.

3925
03:13:30,770 --> 03:13:32,750
I guess we just didn't see it.

3926
03:13:32,870 --> 03:13:36,270
Maybe the view we had was...

3927
03:13:36,270 --> 03:13:36,830
I don't know.

3928
03:13:37,050 --> 03:13:39,250
Maybe it was the spectator.

3929
03:13:41,870 --> 03:13:43,670
We just didn't see some of the side kills.

3930
03:13:45,370 --> 03:13:47,750
It felt like Hanna was killing everybody.

3931
03:13:48,110 --> 03:13:49,210
It felt like that, right?

3932
03:13:49,410 --> 03:13:51,310
Maybe it was more so beginning too.

3933
03:13:51,510 --> 03:13:53,350
They might have been getting kills at end game.

3934
03:13:53,490 --> 03:13:55,350
Because you know how they were 1v3ing.

3935
03:13:55,990 --> 03:13:57,750
We saw those 1v3 kills.

3936
03:13:57,750 --> 03:14:00,030
I think late game they definitely got more kills.

3937
03:14:00,150 --> 03:14:00,830
But we didn't see them.

3938
03:14:01,050 --> 03:14:03,170
But beginning it was all like...

3939
03:14:03,170 --> 03:14:06,270
We just saw Hanna's team killing everybody in the beginning.

3940
03:14:07,670 --> 03:14:08,190
Oh my god.

3941
03:14:09,510 --> 03:14:11,610
You can't call the game so early.

3942
03:14:11,770 --> 03:14:12,650
It's anybody's game.

3943
03:14:12,730 --> 03:14:15,550
Yeah, but I was right in my prediction.

3944
03:14:19,030 --> 03:14:20,090
That's my oshi!

3945
03:14:22,750 --> 03:14:24,730
I'll show you some biases right now.

3946
03:14:24,730 --> 03:14:25,370
No!

3947
03:14:27,390 --> 03:14:30,530
I guess we have almost everybody.

3948
03:14:31,330 --> 03:14:35,250
Team sparkles did win against team 5up.

3949
03:14:35,250 --> 03:14:37,570
Okay, you definitely didn't hear me celebrating that.

3950
03:14:38,010 --> 03:14:38,990
I don't want to hear it.

3951
03:14:41,650 --> 03:14:44,050
He got there in the end.

3952
03:14:45,370 --> 03:14:46,070
Wow.

3953
03:14:47,510 --> 03:14:50,270
Even the overall kills and everything.

3954
03:14:50,510 --> 03:14:51,130
Oh my god.

3955
03:14:51,130 --> 03:14:55,230
Smallhead with 264 overall kills.

3956
03:14:55,270 --> 03:14:55,550
Wow.

3957
03:14:55,550 --> 03:14:57,230
That's the highest out of everyone too.

3958
03:14:57,470 --> 03:15:00,890
Most overall wins and highest overall kills.

3959
03:15:01,150 --> 03:15:02,110
That's a lot.

3960
03:15:02,830 --> 03:15:04,110
And they just swept.

3961
03:15:04,890 --> 03:15:09,290
The second team was 231 kills.

3962
03:15:10,990 --> 03:15:12,390
Team btmc.

3963
03:15:13,770 --> 03:15:15,130
Yeah, but still 264.

3964
03:15:16,270 --> 03:15:16,890
264?

3965
03:15:18,730 --> 03:15:21,150
That is a lot of kills.

3966
03:15:21,550 --> 03:15:22,730
What is that?

3967
03:15:22,770 --> 03:15:23,470
Over 4 games?

3968
03:15:24,650 --> 03:15:25,910
5 games is that?

3969
03:15:25,990 --> 03:15:28,710
5 different games and that's 264 kills?

3970
03:15:29,090 --> 03:15:29,390
Yeah.

3971
03:15:29,730 --> 03:15:33,230
Within 5 games?

3972
03:15:33,330 --> 03:15:35,390
That's so much for 5 games in general.

3973
03:15:36,370 --> 03:15:38,850
Which is very crazy to see.

3974
03:15:40,990 --> 03:15:43,270
We're still winning on one more team.

3975
03:15:43,270 --> 03:15:44,670
Or one more match.

3976
03:15:46,150 --> 03:15:47,650
One final match.

3977
03:15:47,870 --> 03:15:48,030
Yeah.

3978
03:15:48,970 --> 03:15:50,530
Who's the last final match?

3979
03:15:51,110 --> 03:15:52,950
It's Team Snifferish vs.

3980
03:15:53,110 --> 03:15:54,350
Team Shubble.

3981
03:15:57,470 --> 03:15:58,970
Oh beautiful, look at this.

3982
03:15:59,030 --> 03:16:00,470
We get to see the rematches.

3983
03:16:01,030 --> 03:16:01,530
Gum Gum!

3984
03:16:02,210 --> 03:16:03,370
We love you Gum Gum!

3985
03:16:06,690 --> 03:16:09,250
If Gum Gum had a concert, I would be there.

3986
03:16:09,450 --> 03:16:09,730
Yeah.

3987
03:16:12,250 --> 03:16:12,810
Gum Gum!

3988
03:16:12,810 --> 03:16:13,650
Bring back Gum Gum!

3989
03:16:13,750 --> 03:16:15,990
Replace all of my boss with Gum Gum.

3990
03:16:16,490 --> 03:16:17,030
Honestly.

3991
03:16:17,470 --> 03:16:19,550
Give the people what they want.

3992
03:16:19,870 --> 03:16:26,550
In the next MCL, you aren't going to have any Minecraft Pro analysis because I'm going to be there.

3993
03:16:26,870 --> 03:16:28,750
I'm going to just be protecting Gum Gum the whole time.

3994
03:16:29,130 --> 03:16:30,230
I'm not even going to be trying.

3995
03:16:30,670 --> 03:16:32,690
I'm going to be surrounding Gum Gum.

3996
03:16:33,370 --> 03:16:33,930
Promotion!

3997
03:16:36,350 --> 03:16:37,750
Gum Gum bodyguard.

3998
03:16:37,750 --> 03:16:42,750
You have to get through the VTuber casting to get in the tournament.

3999
03:16:44,430 --> 03:16:45,550
This was your test.

4000
03:16:46,170 --> 03:16:47,370
Small ass victory.

4001
03:16:48,650 --> 03:16:49,470
And once again...

4002
03:16:49,470 --> 03:16:52,750
It's just because they can't have two Captain Sparkles in the tournament.

4003
03:16:53,310 --> 03:16:53,630
True.

4004
03:16:56,090 --> 03:16:59,030
Only one Captain Sparkles per tournament.

4005
03:17:01,070 --> 03:17:02,970
No British allowed.

4006
03:17:03,150 --> 03:17:07,330
We should have a whole Sparkles team.

4007
03:17:07,530 --> 03:17:08,610
Captain Sparkles.

4008
03:17:09,050 --> 03:17:10,330
Major Sparkles.

4009
03:17:11,590 --> 03:17:15,770
I like how you said Major Sparkles before British Sparkles.

4010
03:17:15,810 --> 03:17:16,910
British Sparkles.

4011
03:17:17,110 --> 03:17:18,750
Admiral Sparkles.

4012
03:17:20,650 --> 03:17:21,850
Private Sparkles.

4013
03:17:22,370 --> 03:17:23,030
Yeah, exactly.

4014
03:17:24,330 --> 03:17:25,610
That's the Gum Gum guard.

4015
03:17:26,090 --> 03:17:27,850
The Gum Gum guard.

4016
03:17:28,270 --> 03:17:29,930
The Sparkle guard.

4017
03:17:30,150 --> 03:17:30,930
The Sparkle guard.

4018
03:17:32,970 --> 03:17:35,150
Which was your favorite map, Doki?

4019
03:17:36,230 --> 03:17:37,450
Oh, that's hard.

4020
03:17:37,610 --> 03:17:39,210
I think I like Gum Gum.

4021
03:17:43,050 --> 03:17:46,890
That map was unique because it was like really, you know...

4022
03:17:46,890 --> 03:17:48,810
There's high ground and low ground.

4023
03:17:49,310 --> 03:17:49,730
Yeah, exactly.

4024
03:17:50,170 --> 03:17:51,530
And I think it wasn't that...

4025
03:17:51,530 --> 03:17:54,470
I mean, it was big with the low ground stuff, but I feel like...

4026
03:17:54,470 --> 03:17:56,850
I think the last map was huge.

4027
03:17:56,870 --> 03:17:57,250
Huge!

4028
03:17:57,250 --> 03:17:59,930
There's so much going on.

4029
03:18:00,790 --> 03:18:00,910
Huge.

4030
03:18:01,450 --> 03:18:03,270
I feel bad for the spectators.

4031
03:18:04,230 --> 03:18:07,190
Computers, the render distance is maxed out.

4032
03:18:08,630 --> 03:18:11,090
There's so many things to look at, too.

4033
03:18:12,030 --> 03:18:14,810
There's so many things happening at the same time, so it's hard to capture.

4034
03:18:15,070 --> 03:18:16,970
Because there were tunnels, too, for the last map.

4035
03:18:17,070 --> 03:18:19,390
It felt like there were so many things going on.

4036
03:18:19,890 --> 03:18:20,050
Yeah.

4037
03:18:20,270 --> 03:18:25,350
Maybe that's where we missed some of the kills, because obviously Team Small Land ended up getting more kills than Team Hana.

4038
03:18:25,350 --> 03:18:27,510
It could have been also late game.

4039
03:18:28,170 --> 03:18:31,390
Yeah, I 100% believe it was a lot of late game kills, too.

4040
03:18:32,090 --> 03:18:34,990
I guess that creep really helped Team Small Land.

4041
03:18:35,050 --> 03:18:37,570
Getting that mid boss was able to get them a load of upgrades.

4042
03:18:42,110 --> 03:18:43,530
And there it is.

4043
03:18:43,770 --> 03:18:44,890
That was the victory.

4044
03:18:45,830 --> 03:18:45,850
Wow.

4045
03:18:47,390 --> 03:18:48,590
There it is!

4046
03:18:48,650 --> 03:18:51,110
That was a clean kill, too, at the end.

4047
03:18:51,670 --> 03:18:56,030
Yeah, that was pretty exciting to be our first co-casting at Minecraft Tournament.

4048
03:18:56,790 --> 03:18:58,170
Sorry, trio casting.

4049
03:19:00,290 --> 03:19:00,650
Oh, yeah.

4050
03:19:00,830 --> 03:19:01,010
Trio.

4051
03:19:01,210 --> 03:19:03,910
Thank you, analysis expert.

4052
03:19:04,230 --> 03:19:04,930
Hey, that's me.

4053
03:19:04,930 --> 03:19:05,650
Thank you.

4054
03:19:07,370 --> 03:19:08,490
Thanks for having me.

4055
03:19:08,890 --> 03:19:09,310
Yeah.

4056
03:19:09,630 --> 03:19:15,530
Thanks for giving us the analysis and telling us what was going on, too, in a more professional manner.

4057
03:19:15,950 --> 03:19:16,310
I know.

4058
03:19:16,850 --> 03:19:22,450
I'm just trying to help you guys out and make sure that everyone understands what's going on whenever I can.

4059
03:19:22,530 --> 03:19:23,650
Thank you guys for having me.

4060
03:19:24,870 --> 03:19:26,070
I'm jealous, man.

4061
03:19:26,110 --> 03:19:27,370
You guys got these little VTubers.

4062
03:19:27,490 --> 03:19:27,790
Look at you.

4063
03:19:27,830 --> 03:19:28,590
You're dancing around.

4064
03:19:28,730 --> 03:19:31,370
You can technically dance around.

4065
03:19:31,630 --> 03:19:31,870
Yeah.

4066
03:19:32,930 --> 03:19:34,010
I have been.

4067
03:19:34,230 --> 03:19:34,790
I've been.

4068
03:19:38,310 --> 03:19:39,750
Dude, I've been sitting here.

4069
03:19:39,850 --> 03:19:44,930
I've had my webcam on the whole time just so that I could pretend I was on the screen.

4070
03:19:45,090 --> 03:19:45,630
For who?

4071
03:19:46,970 --> 03:19:48,070
Literally for me.

4072
03:19:48,070 --> 03:19:48,930
I wanted to...

4073
03:19:51,710 --> 03:19:52,670
Flash!

4074
03:19:53,770 --> 03:19:55,650
That's so funny.

4075
03:19:57,790 --> 03:19:59,410
Oh my god.

4076
03:19:59,570 --> 03:20:03,290
I felt like Five Nights at Freddy's jumpscare.

4077
03:20:03,790 --> 03:20:05,210
British jumpscare.

4078
03:20:08,270 --> 03:20:09,250
Oh my god.

4079
03:20:10,390 --> 03:20:11,350
Flashbang.

4080
03:20:13,790 --> 03:20:14,770
Oh my god.

4081
03:20:14,770 --> 03:20:15,970
That's like flashbang.

4082
03:20:16,470 --> 03:20:16,990
Flashbang.

4083
03:20:17,170 --> 03:20:18,690
Oh my god.

4084
03:20:21,030 --> 03:20:25,540
I wasn't expecting that.

4085
03:20:26,060 --> 03:20:27,340
That was amazing.

4086
03:20:29,660 --> 03:20:31,140
What a jumpscare.

4087
03:20:31,260 --> 03:20:35,800
I almost got a little afraid that we're going to go 3D for a while.

4088
03:20:37,440 --> 03:20:39,300
No, relax, relax, relax.

4089
03:20:39,480 --> 03:20:39,880
It's okay.

4090
03:20:41,000 --> 03:20:45,140
I'm not ready to be in 2D form for a little longer.

4091
03:20:47,680 --> 03:20:48,740
That was fun.

4092
03:20:48,860 --> 03:20:53,300
I had a great time co-casting or trio-casting with all of you guys.

4093
03:20:53,520 --> 03:20:55,180
Thank you again for inviting us.

4094
03:20:55,700 --> 03:20:57,060
Thank you for having us.

4095
03:20:57,940 --> 03:21:00,060
Congrats to Team Small Land!

4096
03:21:04,160 --> 03:21:09,200
Yeah, and Fulham, if we ever have any speedrun...

4097
03:21:09,200 --> 03:21:12,580
If we ever do another speedrun hardcore we'll come to you.

4098
03:21:12,740 --> 03:21:14,420
I will be there no matter what.

4099
03:21:14,420 --> 03:21:15,980
I promise you.

4100
03:21:15,980 --> 03:21:16,940
I will be there.

4101
03:21:18,120 --> 03:21:18,940
Don't watch.

4102
03:21:19,020 --> 03:21:20,380
I'm going to ban you from my channel.

4103
03:21:20,380 --> 03:21:21,200
Okay, that's fine.

4104
03:21:21,960 --> 03:21:23,500
I'm not allowed to watch anymore.

4105
03:21:23,740 --> 03:21:26,120
We will beat Minecraft a second time.

4106
03:21:26,920 --> 03:21:28,560
I believe in you guys.

4107
03:21:29,280 --> 03:21:30,760
Just don't watch us.

4108
03:21:31,300 --> 03:21:31,780
Okay, fine.

4109
03:21:31,880 --> 03:21:35,420
I'll close my eyes, but I'll listen and I'll go.

4110
03:21:35,720 --> 03:21:37,140
You need to do this next.

4111
03:21:37,160 --> 03:21:38,040
Don't even listen.

4112
03:21:39,060 --> 03:21:39,540
Fine.

4113
03:21:44,420 --> 03:21:45,220
Everything will be okay.

4114
03:21:46,220 --> 03:21:49,560
We just don't want you to steal our strats, you know?

4115
03:21:50,340 --> 03:21:53,860
We have some of our own secret strats and everything.

4116
03:21:54,360 --> 03:21:56,780
We don't want that exposed to the world.

4117
03:21:57,000 --> 03:21:58,220
I think you guys are a bit too good.

4118
03:21:58,320 --> 03:22:00,580
If I tried to copy your strats, I think you'd win.

4119
03:22:01,140 --> 03:22:02,680
Here, I'll get you in on a secret.

4120
03:22:03,120 --> 03:22:04,140
If you don't...

4121
03:22:04,140 --> 03:22:07,400
One of them is to just kill yourself if you don't feel the vibe.

4122
03:22:08,160 --> 03:22:08,880
That's true.

4123
03:22:10,080 --> 03:22:11,520
You know what the crazy thing is?

4124
03:22:11,520 --> 03:22:13,420
That's actually a real strat as well.

4125
03:22:13,480 --> 03:22:15,200
And I'll tell you about that another time.

4126
03:22:15,240 --> 03:22:17,320
Oh my god!

4127
03:22:18,740 --> 03:22:19,620
I believe...

4128
03:22:19,620 --> 03:22:21,740
Do you have anything else you'd like to say?

4129
03:22:22,360 --> 03:22:24,580
No, I just want to say a massive thank you to you two.

4130
03:22:24,880 --> 03:22:26,680
It's been an amazing vibe.

4131
03:22:27,500 --> 03:22:31,820
I've been over the moon being able to jump around, talk around with you guys.

4132
03:22:32,120 --> 03:22:36,820
You guys have brought the absolute most hype that we've ever seen to a Minecraft event, I think.

4133
03:22:37,120 --> 03:22:40,680
We need to have more casters that are like you guys.

4134
03:22:40,840 --> 03:22:43,440
Just excited and...

4135
03:22:43,440 --> 03:22:44,880
No, it's been awesome!

4136
03:22:45,840 --> 03:22:46,960
I love that.

4137
03:22:47,040 --> 03:22:49,620
I love that because it's been so exciting.

4138
03:22:49,840 --> 03:22:53,040
If there was three of me it wouldn't work, right?

4139
03:22:53,180 --> 03:22:57,820
I'd just be yapping about statistics and...

4140
03:22:57,820 --> 03:22:58,020
Right?

4141
03:23:00,020 --> 03:23:02,280
You needed to balance me out and I loved it.

4142
03:23:02,360 --> 03:23:03,500
It was a great balance.

4143
03:23:03,660 --> 03:23:04,940
So thank you guys for having me on.

4144
03:23:04,980 --> 03:23:06,100
I've absolutely loved it.

4145
03:23:06,100 --> 03:23:06,860
Yeah!

4146
03:23:07,420 --> 03:23:08,680
Thanks for all the analysis.

4147
03:23:09,560 --> 03:23:11,180
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

4148
03:23:12,100 --> 03:23:15,300
But also, I think, Clem, you were supposed to say something too.

4149
03:23:15,820 --> 03:23:17,140
Oh, am I supposed to say something?

4150
03:23:17,880 --> 03:23:19,460
One more shout-out.

4151
03:23:20,260 --> 03:23:21,760
Dude, yeah, okay, sorry.

4152
03:23:21,800 --> 03:23:23,220
It was my segue for you.

4153
03:23:24,160 --> 03:23:27,980
Dude, you can try your best but more importantly, shout-out to you two.

4154
03:23:28,260 --> 03:23:33,680
But also, thank you very much to H&R BLOG for making amazing things happen in gaming.

4155
03:23:33,680 --> 03:23:34,300
Woo!

4156
03:23:34,960 --> 03:23:39,680
Make sure to go to LunarClan and check out the free HRB cosmetics.

4157
03:23:40,200 --> 03:23:43,460
And remember, with H&R BLOG, it's better with BLOG.

4158
03:23:43,580 --> 03:23:44,480
Thank you guys.

4159
03:23:46,020 --> 03:23:52,160
Remember to use exclamation point Lunar in both men and I's chat to see more details about it.

4160
03:23:52,220 --> 03:23:52,700
Yeah!

4161
03:23:53,460 --> 03:23:54,580
Thank you guys!

4162
03:23:54,600 --> 03:23:55,740
That is so real.
