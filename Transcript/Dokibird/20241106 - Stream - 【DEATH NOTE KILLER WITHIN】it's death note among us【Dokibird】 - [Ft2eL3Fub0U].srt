1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:02,580
I'm live.

3
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:03,440
Whoa, no intro.

4
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,500
I'm going in raw.

5
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,260
Let's go.

6
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,160
I don't think this kid didn't hear that.

7
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,920
They heard it in other people's chat, but not mine.

8
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,290
Wait, where's my... where's the code I posted?

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,190
Oh my god.

10
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:30,050
I'm actually... I am a Death Note fanatic.

11
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,430
I love Death Note so much.

12
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:31,870
I...

13
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:32,990
I bought everything.

14
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:33,810
I bought the novels.

15
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,390
I watched the live action movies.

16
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,030
The bad ones and the good ones.

17
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,910
I watched L Change the World.

18
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,210
That shit was terrible, but I still watched it.

19
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:46,350
I watched where he fucking solves a disease that's like COVID, but like it was pre-COVID when that movie came out.

20
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,050
And it was like, he like saves the world by curing COVID.

21
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,190
It was crazy.

22
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,530
And it was pre... it was literally pre-COVID when that movie came out.

23
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,250
It was crazy.

24
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,950
And then I bought the Beyond Birthday stuff.

25
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,430
I bought like the art.

26
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,950
I was... I was a freak.

27
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,890
I was a fucking freak.

28
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,290
It was like my first... it was literally my first anime.

29
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,410
Like I... I did not care about anime until I found out about Death Note.

30
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,550
Who the fuck is Laddy 2?

31
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:19,130
Oh no.

32
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,110
Uh-oh.

33
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,050
Wait, did somebody show the code?

34
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,650
Did somebody show the code?

35
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,850
Who's... oh, okay.

36
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:29,250
We leave.

37
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:29,650
We leave.

38
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,130
We leave.

39
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,310
How do I leave?

40
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,610
How do I leave?

41
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:43,670
Oh.

42
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,550
Oh.

43
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,510
Okay.

44
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:49,990
Okay.

45
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:50,870
I'll... I'll leave.

46
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,710
Okay.

47
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,410
I... I quit.

48
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,770
Oh, it's Steam Maintenance.

49
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,410
No!

50
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:38,070
No, the thing is, guys.

51
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:38,810
It was...

52
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:47,710
The thing is, like, I'm unable... I'm unable to make it a private lobby because the code doesn't work in a private lobby.

53
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:48,710
I...

54
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,150
I was like, no, it's a pub.

55
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,110
Like, I was like, no, it's a fucking public lobby.

56
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,010
And I'm like, oh!

57
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,670
I get to actually invite... I can't even close the lobby.

58
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,730
That was the worst part.

59
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,090
I'm remaking the lobby now.

60
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,450
Oh, my God.

61
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:23,630
Oh, my God.

62
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:24,750
I literally... I quit!

63
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,310
I quit!

64
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:42,940
I have... Okay, I'm gonna make it private in the... I have to up... I need... I need... Guys, I need people to accept my friend request because a private lobby, you can't join via code.

65
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,160
You need to join via...

66
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,940
Oh, my God.

67
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,740
Oh, my God.

68
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,800
Anyway, this is Death Note Among Us.

69
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,500
Yeah, I'm waiting for Steam to come back up.

70
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:11,240
Why do I always accidentally make a collabs on Tuesday?

71
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,180
What's wrong with me?

72
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,220
It's like...

73
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,900
Okay, so... So, for those who don't know, this is basically like...

74
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,540
This is, like I said, it's Among Us.

75
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,180
It's basically Among Us, Death Note.

76
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:45,440
I'm just explaining the rules to my chat while we wait for it to come back.

77
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,340
I'm pretty sure... I'm pretty sure it was stream snipers.

78
00:04:49,400 --> 00:05:03,400
I'm pretty sure... I'm pretty sure it was stream snipers that joined because Mint and I... Mint, Amelie, Grim and I, we were in that public lobby for so long.

79
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,100
And then suddenly, we all went live.

80
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,860
And then we all went live and then people were joining.

81
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,780
Randoms were joining our lobby.

82
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:20,200
So, I'm pretty sure it was a stream snipers that came in.

83
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,640
Like, I won't not be surprised.

84
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:28,400
Like, we were literally by ourselves in that lobby for so long.

85
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,440
We were there for so long just talking.

86
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,700
And then suddenly, like, seven people joined at once or somebody leaked the code.

87
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,980
It was that or somebody leaked the code.

88
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,820
So, I was like, what the fuck?

89
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,840
Like, how did all you guys get in?

90
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,900
Like, so fast.

91
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,420
Um, okay.

92
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,080
Connection failed.

93
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,540
Usually, it shouldn't be that bad.

94
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,180
I need to use the bathroom.

95
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,400
I was prepping for this collab.

96
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,740
I'll be right back real quick, guys.

97
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,230
Back.

98
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,410
I'm back.

99
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:55,530
Basically, okay.

100
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,930
So, this game is basically like, like I said, it's among us.

101
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:05,790
But instead of one imposter, there's five imposters.

102
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,950
But all the imposters are pretending that they are an investigator.

103
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:23,270
So, what's going on is that there's one Kira, one Elle, four Kira followers, and four investigators.

104
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:27,830
So, the investigators and Elle have to work together to figure out who is Kira.

105
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:32,870
And the game ends whether they all complete the... It's Kira versus Elle.

106
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,470
And they all have to complete tasks.

107
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:42,010
And it's either which team completes the most tasks or Elle dies or Kira dies.

108
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,370
So, it's one or the other.

109
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,890
So, or not Elle.

110
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,570
Elle dies or Kira gets arrested.

111
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:53,030
And when you get arrested, you're chained to a person.

112
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,990
So, it's like the famous handcuff stuff.

113
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:04,650
And you can, as Kira, you can actually give your notebooks to other followers.

114
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:12,650
So, if you think you're too sus, you can give your notebook to another Kira follower.

115
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,870
And then they become Kira.

116
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,470
So, there's a lot of mind games to it.

117
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:29,130
And then, like, you know, if Kira doesn't have... And then, like, when you arrest, when you call somebody out as sus... Okay, let me hide this.

118
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:34,350
When you call somebody else as sus, you have to give... They're going to hold items.

119
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:38,570
But you can accidentally give the items to a Kira follower.

120
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:52,090
So, if a Kira... If you think a Kira follower is investigated, like they tricked you and they're called out too much, that might be Kira, won't get in trouble.

121
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,750
So, like, they'll still continue the game.

122
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,170
Because, like, a Kira follower grabs... Got all the items and stuff.

123
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,650
So, it's, like, very...

124
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,430
It's very interesting.

125
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:04,850
Okay, let's see.

126
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,830
I'm creating the room right now.

127
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,430
Okay, not to actually...

128
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,190
Alright, now!

129
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,790
Now it's private.

130
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,590
I did it!

131
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:19,290
Now it's private.

132
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:20,450
Okay, now I need to...

133
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,910
Alright, now I gotta add people.

134
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,530
I'm adding people right now.

135
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:31,210
Okay, we got... And then, I need to make sure...

136
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,190
Wait, not everybody is on.

137
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,350
I need everybody to get on.

138
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,770
Oh my god.

139
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,490
Okay, here we go.

140
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,450
Get on Discord.

141
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,450
I mean, get on Steam.

142
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:57,230
I mean, get online so I can...

143
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:00,650
Alright.

144
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:07,290
Okay, I'm waiting for... I'm waiting for people to get on Steam so I can...

145
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,810
People are slowly logging in.

146
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,190
Oh, have mercy.

147
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,350
Okay, have mercy.

148
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,110
I don't see it yet.

149
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:24,850
Somebody is... Why is Bao playing web fishing?

150
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:25,950
What?

151
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,870
Why is Bao playing web fishing?

152
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:45,390
I noticed Bao is not on the right game right now.

153
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:51,990
Okay, the people... I still have no friends.

154
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,070
I still have no friends.

155
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:00,950
Okay, I'm inviting people, but why no people join me?

156
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:05,910
Cute.

157
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,950
Please show up online so I can invite you.

158
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,990
I'm sending invites now.

159
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,110
I'm sending invites.

160
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,750
Why is nobody getting on?

161
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,710
Why am I alone?

162
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:22,650
I'm sending so many invites.

163
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,050
Oh wait, there's Minh.

164
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,070
Okay, and then there's Bao.

165
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:29,650
There's Vienna.

166
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:37,050
Oh, you might have to restart.

167
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,970
Damn, I have to restart Steam because I got in automatically.

168
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,710
Maybe restart Steam.

169
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,510
Maybe restart Steam.

170
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,970
It's not the game.

171
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,690
It's Steam.

172
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,810
I'm by myself.

173
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:00,650
I'm alone in this world.

174
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:01,510
I'm alone.

175
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,970
Lonely.

176
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,070
Mr. Lonely.

177
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,370
I have nobody.

178
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,010
I'm ready to call my own.

179
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,410
Okay, all right, I need a re-invite.

180
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,310
Okay, it's re-invite invitation time.

181
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,350
The hardest part, getting 10 people in the lobby.

182
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,510
I think that's actually the hardest part.

183
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,070
Getting 10 people into this lobby.

184
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:37,910
Oh my god.

185
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,650
Okay, invite.

186
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:41,830
Invite.

187
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,710
Uh, invite.

188
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,910
Um, I'm losing.

189
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,830
Um, there's too many people.

190
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,230
Invite.

191
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,230
Uh, did I invite this person?

192
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,030
I think I did.

193
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:04,250
Okay, and then I'm just waiting for people to just send some more invites again.

194
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:09,070
Okay, all right, this should work.

195
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,630
I didn't get one.

196
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,690
Oh my god, do I have to get online?

197
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,290
God fucking...

198
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:18,910
No, I can't be invisible.

199
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,410
I have to pretend to be online again.

200
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,910
I have to.

201
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,890
Okay, give me a sec.

202
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,630
All right, preferences.

203
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,710
Privacy settings.

204
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,990
No, I have to pretend I'm... I exist on the... I pretend I exist.

205
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,230
All right, friends menu.

206
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:37,890
Queue.

207
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,290
I have to pretend I exist on Steam again.

208
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:44,070
God fucking damn it.

209
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,590
Okay, this should work now.

210
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,630
This should work.

211
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,130
Okay.

212
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:56,910
Uh, oh my god, I hope I don't accidentally invite the wrong people.

213
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,890
Okay, did it work now?

214
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,140
No!

215
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:10,720
Okay, do I need to... I need to restart Steam!

216
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,440
Okay, I restart Steam.

217
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,680
Okay, oh my god, okay, I restart Steam.

218
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,180
Okay, oh my god, guys, Steam.

219
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,000
This is just...

220
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,060
This is a Steam issue, I would like to say.

221
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,540
It is not, um, it's not, um... Wait, maybe... Okay, wait.

222
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,560
It is a Steam issue, chat.

223
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,820
It is nothing else.

224
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,900
It is merely a Steam issue.

225
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,500
It is not a Doki issue.

226
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,420
All right, back at it again.

227
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,220
Back to Death Note Killer Within.

228
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,140
It's just unlucky that we had the...

229
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,460
That we have maintenance that messed everything up.

230
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,280
And I choose, like, I always accidentally choose the time, too.

231
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,040
I keep forgetting.

232
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,560
I keep forgetting Tuesday is, like, a fucking actual day.

233
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,160
Like, it's just... Oh, I keep forgetting that Tuesday exists.

234
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,900
Tuesday at 3 p.m.

235
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,540
every time.

236
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,600
Because I'm like, oh, I should get a time for that work for, like, our EU person.

237
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,540
Like, we should, we should have that.

238
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,940
And then I'm like, oh my god.

239
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,640
Oh my god.

240
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,920
But every time.

241
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,100
Every time.

242
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,340
Wait, does it work now?

243
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,860
Does it work now?

244
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,060
And invites are still weird.

245
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,580
Because maybe someone else should make lobby.

246
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,360
Maybe I shouldn't make lobby.

247
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,880
Steam won't start.

248
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,580
We're all having problems.

249
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,620
Oh!

250
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,520
Oh, it's not.

251
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,380
It's not me.

252
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,280
I knew it.

253
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,980
I knew it's not me.

254
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,840
It's not me.

255
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,960
I knew I wasn't the issue.

256
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,780
Wait, you're different now.

257
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,720
We did it!

258
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,640
Okay, okay, okay.

259
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,140
I'm gonna start inviting more people.

260
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,480
All right.

261
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,420
Oh my god, it's working.

262
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,300
It's working.

263
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,080
It wasn't me.

264
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,260
I knew it.

265
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,380
I knew I wasn't the problem.

266
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,080
I fucking knew it, guys.

267
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,420
Never think you're the problem.

268
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:37,220
Never.

269
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,160
Never think you're the problem.

270
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,400
Okay, let's see.

271
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,400
Who else?

272
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,380
All right, I don't think I...

273
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,240
It's V.

274
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:56,880
Yeah, yeah.

275
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,640
If you want to... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

276
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:06,920
Oh, oh, you go to settings and then you go to... it's at this audio.

277
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,660
I'm gonna turn that off, too.

278
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:15,760
Hello?

279
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,500
I have proximity chat.

280
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:17,940
Yeah, yeah.

281
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,880
Hey, we got you.

282
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:19,900
Hello!

283
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,120
Okay, I'm turning up.

284
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,220
Oh my god!

285
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:25,820
Pay to win!

286
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,420
Let's go!

287
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,100
Okay, like, can you guys invite people or only... only I can... is it only I can invite people or can you guys invite people, too?

288
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,260
Uh, let me see.

289
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,160
Because it's in the... Is there a way to make it push to talk instead of... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

290
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,860
You go to settings and you click sound.

291
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,620
I'm on... I'm not on push to talk right now because we're setting up.

292
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,420
Okay, I'll up the game a little bit.

293
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,720
Uh, oh my gosh.

294
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,460
Oh, there you go!

295
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,040
We got Limu!

296
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,860
Oh my god, we got L!

297
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,740
Okay, Limu is definitely an L.

298
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,120
Fucking nerd.

299
00:17:59,380 --> 00:17:59,820
Okay, we good.

300
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,420
Oh, yeah.

301
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,020
Yeah.

302
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,000
Hey, I'm L.

303
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,320
Oh, you're not.

304
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,060
You're like... I joined the fucking game and I get called a fucking nerd.

305
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,920
Okay, okay, I'm gonna show guys.

306
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,480
This is...

307
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,600
This is a dollar store L right here.

308
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,880
Guess who's like... This is like bootleg L, right?

309
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,380
I'm literally L!

310
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,260
It's on my shirt!

311
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,320
It's literally on my t-shirt!

312
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,180
You're not okay, L.

313
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,580
What happened?

314
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,720
You look like... You look like you took like a soccer ball to the face, like...

315
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,080
No, I look like I got stung by like some bees.

316
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,360
Oh, yeah, you got like those like dogs.

317
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,400
Those dogs that got stung by like bees and stuff.

318
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,200
Yeah, yeah.

319
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,060
That looks like you.

320
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,680
Okay, let me see who else I have.

321
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:50,000
Oh, we got... It's kind of like if L started aging and then got into denial and just got way too much Botox over it.

322
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,820
Alright, let me check my settings.

323
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,080
You got like... Oh my god, you went to the wrong plastic surgeon, that's for sure.

324
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,080
Yeah.

325
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,140
Okay, I'm gonna boost up.

326
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,760
Let's see.

327
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,340
Question, would this game not let anybody else have like... It wouldn't let me use the name Monarch.

328
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,500
I don't know.

329
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,220
I was like, you're not allowed to use that name, and I went, huh?

330
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,860
That's weird.

331
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:16,720
Weird.

332
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,480
Yeah, it's weird.

333
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,780
Yeah, I have like, uh...

334
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,500
I don't know.

335
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,340
Maybe... I don't know if like... I think these names... Maybe somebody else already named themselves Monarch.

336
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,480
I think these names are like...

337
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,520
Claimed.

338
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,000
You can claim names here.

339
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,380
Oh, I think... I think so too.

340
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

341
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
So there's actual usernames here.

342
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,720
Honestly, some of these avatars look like dolls in like a Chucky movie or something.

343
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,840
No, they're like the...

344
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,440
They're like puppets from N.

345
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,040
He uses these puppets.

346
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,500
They're really ugly, but like...

347
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,260
I see.

348
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:46,980
Ugly.

349
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,340
But he's an orphan, so like, it's excused.

350
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,620
Wait, who made these?

351
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,200
N, Nier.

352
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,560
The two kids.

353
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the L successor.

354
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,460
The little guy.

355
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,220
The blonde one, right?

356
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,280
No, that's Mellow.

357
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:00,880
Oh.

358
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,500
That's Mellow.

359
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,520
It's like the ones that people care less about when they jump the shark.

360
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,200
Wait, so he's the white haired one?

361
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,540
Yeah, he's the white haired one.

362
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,960
Oh my god, you gotta get your Weeb card revoked.

363
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,880
I really um actually do an anime lore.

364
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,820
That's so sad.

365
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,480
Look, I just got stung by 10,000 bees, okay?

366
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,160
I'm crazy.

367
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,040
You let me um actually do.

368
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,280
You just got out of the ER.

369
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,840
Yeah, I'm, I'm going through it, okay?

370
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,440
Did the doctors give you that little like party thing?

371
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,320
Are they like, oh you did such a good job.

372
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,380
Here's a little toy.

373
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,600
They look like someone's...

374
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,220
They look like someone's Gaia online avatar.

375
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,560
Oh my god, you do actually.

376
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,300
I don't think I have Giga on, on Steam.

377
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,100
I think I added her, but I don't think she accepted it yet.

378
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,620
I might have her.

379
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,180
Let me go left.

380
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,880
Let's see...

381
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,600
I added her, but she's offline.

382
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,480
Woah!

383
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,260
Yo, yo, change your mic.

384
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:02,860
What's up?

385
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:11,380
What was that?

386
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,220
Was that a bow?

387
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:12,860
What is that?

388
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,240
Can you get a fucking uh...

389
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,880
Oh no.

390
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,380
Is it better now?

391
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but you gotta up your volume more.

392
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,540
Turn it back.

393
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,720
I could feel it in my teeth.

394
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,580
It's very nostalgic.

395
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:39,060
Yeah, it's like going to one of those old static TVs and opening your mouth right next to it.

396
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,320
Someone's connecting to dial up right now.

397
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,560
Oh wait, I think that's... wait, is it Juniper?

398
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,540
Is Juniper dialed up?

399
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:48,720
Huh?

400
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,860
Okay, up my mic volume.

401
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,380
Whoa.

402
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,500
Wait, I'll mute.

403
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:53,940
I'll mute.

404
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:54,980
No, okay, you're good.

405
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,280
You're good.

406
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:55,940
You're okay, Juniper.

407
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,440
You're okay.

408
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,620
You're not static.

409
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,420
Everyone talk one at a time so we can like single out the person.

410
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,320
Snuffy said she wants an invite.

411
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:06,880
She needs an invite.

412
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,080
Oh, okay.

413
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:07,860
I'll get her in.

414
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,540
She has to be online.

415
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,460
How's my volume?

416
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,340
How's my volume?

417
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,560
Oh my god.

418
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,300
We didn't discord nitro boost this.

419
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:20,940
We didn't.

420
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,180
Oh, there's Snuffy.

421
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:23,780
Is it yours?

422
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,340
Hi, hi.

423
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,300
Hello.

424
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:25,720
Hi.

425
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,320
Oh, Snuffy, you look great.

426
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:29,820
Okay.

427
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,560
Oh my god, you guys look fantastic.

428
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,480
Okay, who didn't do a tutorial?

429
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,020
Who didn't?

430
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,420
I didn't do the tutorial.

431
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,380
Okay.

432
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,460
I'll give you guys a quick rundown.

433
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,780
Okay, so it's 5v5.

434
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,080
So like there's only one L and one Kira.

435
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:57,120
So you either win by completing tasks as L or Kira or you kill L or you capture Kira.

436
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:02,360
And as Kira, Kira and Kira followers, you can talk to each other with a transmitter.

437
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,160
So like we can like secretly talk to each other.

438
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:10,240
So we're all investigators trying to find out who is Kira and who is Kira followers.

439
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:19,460
And if you're Kira, if you think you're getting sussed out, you can give your notebooks to other Kira followers so they become Kira.

440
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:35,180
And then when you're calling people out as the suspect during the meeting room phase, the L has to give the items to like another investigator, but that investigator could be a Kira follower.

441
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:43,900
So if you give the suspect items to a Kira follower accidentally, then the suspect is not arrested.

442
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,420
It's like, yeah, so it's like, yeah.

443
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,320
And then Kira followers and Kiras can steal your IDs by standing next to them.

444
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:00,880
And I can steal your ID and then we write down your name and you die.

445
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,540
So if I suddenly stand next to somebody and you're like, what the fuck are you standing next to me for?

446
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,780
They might be trying to steal your ID.

447
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,320
And then, yeah, so this one better do.

448
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,080
I am trying to explain the rules!

449
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,200
How did you guys get all these customized things?

450
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,060
Have you all wailed already?

451
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,880
You press T and then be like, please wait a moment.

452
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,540
Oh my god, keikaku dori.

453
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,540
I'm Kira.

454
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:43,940
When the Kira people go near you or anyone goes near you, it'll warn you saying your ID was stolen, but it doesn't mean they did steal it.

455
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,160
You're just supposed to put in your journal that that person was close enough to you to potentially steal it.

456
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:55,100
Yeah, so they don't actually steal it, but it's like, I think it would have been really funny if you hadn't clarified that and then people start screaming at each other.

457
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:04,780
So you gotta be like, I'll be the god of this new world.

458
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:10,200
Wait, how do you have the subtitles?

459
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:16,000
Oh, you go to T, and then you can be like, justice planned.

460
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:27,020
The first menu is like relatively useful stuff, and then it's like player callouts, and then it's like, I will be the god of this world.

461
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:32,460
Wait,

462
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,540
are we missing someone?

463
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,360
Yeah, we're missing Giga.

464
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,580
Giga's offline.

465
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,720
Have we heard from her?

466
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,560
Oh, okay, we have heard from Giga.

467
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:47,220
She said she was going to pee, so maybe she like fell in.

468
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,500
I don't think she's okay in the bathroom.

469
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,000
Is there like a Giga update?

470
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,980
Is she like, has she been gone on her stream for too long?

471
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,780
I'm becoming a player.

472
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:08,170
I like how you can just tell people to leave.

473
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,050
Like, actually, please leave.

474
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,070
Please leave me.

475
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:14,330
Please become a player.

476
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:19,110
Oh my god, that's worse than asking if you're AFK, just like...

477
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,750
So funny.

478
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,250
Oh my god.

479
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,450
I'm gonna adjust my volume just a little bit.

480
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:30,970
Let's see.

481
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:35,150
I'm going to refill my water while we wait for Giga.

482
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:39,010
Oh, she's still AFK.

483
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:41,410
Apparently, people are saying that she's still AFK on Steam.

484
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:44,090
I don't think she's okay in the bathroom right now.

485
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,870
I don't think she's okay.

486
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,530
There's a battle going on in there.

487
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,330
She made me run out of toilet paper.

488
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,870
No, no, somebody help her.

489
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,490
She has nobody.

490
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,530
She's crying at the door.

491
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,250
She's calling up for help.

492
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,670
She's calling up for help.

493
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:04,730
We're just here.

494
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:06,490
She's in contact.

495
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,970
We're just here shitposting.

496
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:16,810
Oh my god, that's a real battle.

497
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,830
You can't beat the game.

498
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:20,550
God.

499
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:23,630
God.

500
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:24,530
Just God.

501
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,210
Really one word.

502
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:29,710
God.

503
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:36,630
I need you guys to make sure that all of your audios is good, because I'm cooking something.

504
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,170
Okay, okay.

505
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:44,350
I don't know how it'll go, but I think it's great.

506
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,830
All right, are we all ready?

507
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,050
Giga's here.

508
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,530
Giga, can you say something so we can hear you?

509
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,390
Can you hear me?

510
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:57,930
Yeah, yeah, we can hear you.

511
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,450
Giga, were you okay in the bathroom?

512
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,490
Oh yeah, I sat in there for three years.

513
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,530
All right, you guys all ready?

514
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,470
I'm starting the game now.

515
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:09,850
Okay.

516
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:14,870
We can still talk in the loading screen.

517
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,870
Yeah, we can say what role we want.

518
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,010
I'm not gonna be Kira.

519
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:23,550
Right.

520
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,030
I'm not Kira.

521
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,250
I'm not Kira.

522
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:31,970
I'm not Kira.

523
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,250
Who could it be?

524
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,630
How could you be randomized?

525
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:40,650
That's interesting.

526
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,670
Oh my God, who's gonna be Kira?

527
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,430
I like how nobody wants to be the investigator.

528
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,260
Wait, why is there only two of us?

529
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,320
Oh, that's Kira.

530
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,240
Okay, that's Kira.

531
00:28:59,560 --> 00:28:59,840
Okay.

532
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,980
Okay, VN.

533
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,760
No, no, no, we don't know who the other followers are.

534
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,080
Okay, Kira, give us the last items.

535
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,600
Oh, I shouldn't be proximity.

536
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,760
Sorry, I'll just push the time.

537
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:21,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

538
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,540
Hello?

539
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:23,700
Hello?

540
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,160
Is this Kira?

541
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,240
Oh my God, Kira, I'm your biggest fan.

542
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,220
Okay, I need to turn down proximity, or I'm gonna get caught.

543
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,440
Wait, that don't wanna be Kira!

544
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:43,700
Okay,

545
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,540
okay, okay.

546
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,860
Now, now, now.

547
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,420
No, stop!

548
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:53,740
Stop!

549
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,200
They can see!

550
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:54,620
They can see!

551
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,600
You keep pressing it too much!

552
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,140
They can see!

553
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,240
Oh, wait, they can.

554
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,840
Wait, wait.

555
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,620
I need to go get some IDs or something, or I don't know.

556
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,980
Okay, I need to boost up.

557
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,360
Oh, you can boost people up yourself!

558
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,400
That's so cool!

559
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:16,200
Okay, let me get chat and chat mic.

560
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,780
Okay, there we go.

561
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:23,080
I guess I'm... Low key, I can't see anybody.

562
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:23,800
What the hell?

563
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,940
Okay, okay, you got...

564
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,100
I don't know!

565
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,560
Oh, wait, I know what to do.

566
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:35,780
Okay, you gotta... Okay, we gotta...

567
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,980
What's happening?

568
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:40,960
What happened?

569
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:41,920
Oh, what just happened?

570
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,480
Okay.

571
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,780
Okay, what happened today?

572
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,020
Oh my God, what just happened?

573
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,000
Okay, what happened?

574
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,300
Oh, investigator!

575
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,660
Good job!

576
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,380
Good job, guys!

577
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,500
Okay, so one criminal is dead.

578
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,320
Yeah, criminal.

579
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,540
We're even.

580
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,000
Oh my God, we're even, yeah.

581
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,200
It's one on one.

582
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,300
Where is everybody?

583
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,280
Speak up if you're... How do I know if my ID was taken?

584
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:26,180
My ID was taken.

585
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,760
Wait, is it supposed to be in my inventory?

586
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,580
I think Mint.

587
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,060
Mint?

588
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:44,160
Because as soon as I passed you, I got a notification that someone yoinked my ID.

589
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,660
No, that's just... That's just the automatic thing, I think.

590
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,440
It says...

591
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,220
So that, she could have easily stood next to her and yoinked it.

592
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,540
Okay, because Lime said that, I'm gonna vote for her too.

593
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,640
I have to follow her.

594
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,780
I think I'm gonna vote for her.

595
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,680
I knew I would say that, and so they made an arbitrary rule.

596
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,220
I have a question.

597
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,940
How the fuck am I supposed to investigate other players?

598
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,440
Because I failed my investigation.

599
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,780
Can you, like, retract your, like...

600
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:16,180
What happens if you shamelessly point fingers, like...

601
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,520
Well, they get arrested, so like, they basically...

602
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,320
Oh, they get tied to you, so we should...

603
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,900
If we want to, like, suss somebody out, they get, like, handcuffed to the person that got sussed out.

604
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,420
I don't want that.

605
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,460
You don't want to be handcuffed?

606
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,020
I have a question.

607
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,780
Wait, I have a question.

608
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,300
Yeah?

609
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,720
Who is Kira?

610
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,300
Just...

611
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,700
I don't know, Kira.

612
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,880
Who is it?

613
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:48,380
I wanna say, I think Mint and Amelie are both suspicious.

614
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,180
I'm suspicious?

615
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,220
I'm just an investigator.

616
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,620
Nobody won't be suspicious yet.

617
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,920
Nobody has any fucking clue what we're doing.

618
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,640
Doki, why did you vote for me?

619
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:05,800
Because I saw Bao voted for you, and Bao seems to know what she's doing.

620
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,380
I'm not Kira.

621
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,840
That's what Kira would say.

622
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,440
But you can skip both?

623
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,080
I'm not looking for that outfit, not gonna lie.

624
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:14,700
Look at that.

625
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,520
Look at that wig.

626
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,620
Yeah, I mean, look at it.

627
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,120
You're hating on me because I'm styling?

628
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,080
That's so messed up.

629
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,000
Mint is, like, impersonating Elle.

630
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,680
She's doing trick shots on us.

631
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,020
Yeah.

632
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,400
Alright, Kira, who are you gonna vote for?

633
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,200
Wait, lots of people are voting for me.

634
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,120
This is kind of crazy.

635
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,520
Kira, who are you voting for?

636
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,480
No, you just get handcuffed.

637
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:31,920
Nobody.

638
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,260
And every day we don't vote is another death on our hands.

639
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,140
Shut me in jail.

640
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,400
I can't take it anymore.

641
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,340
No one was arrested.

642
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,780
Why are we in class?

643
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,080
Vienna, Vienna, Vienna, Vienna.

644
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,820
Get over here, Vienna, Vienna, Vienna.

645
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,380
Good luck.

646
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,040
Alright, thank God.

647
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,800
I don't want to be Kira anymore.

648
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,880
There's too much pressure.

649
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,120
Hello?

650
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:10,640
Hello?

651
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,760
Where are you going, Grimmy?

652
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,120
Where are you going?

653
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,860
Well, where are you going, huh?

654
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,000
Yeah, what are you investigating, huh?

655
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,020
Alright, alright.

656
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,720
You can't even tell me what you're investigating.

657
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,720
Where's, where's, uh, I need to find...

658
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:38,940
What

659
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:52,570
is happening?

660
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,110
How'd you die?

661
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,050
You died!

662
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,010
Oh!

663
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:01,310
That was fast.

664
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:02,470
Pawn falls.

665
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:03,970
How did that happen?

666
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:05,970
Yay!

667
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,090
Oh my gosh!

668
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,930
We were supposed to protect Elle!

669
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,270
How did you know?

670
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:14,650
It's over, dude.

671
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:16,030
It's over.

672
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,910
Vienna, how did you do it?

673
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:20,630
How did they know?

674
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,970
They're too good, they're too good.

675
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,310
Vienna, how did you know, Vienna?

676
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,790
Vienna is not, is muted.

677
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:33,110
She's so good, she won't even say it.

678
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:33,430
A silent killer.

679
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:35,250
She won't even tell us.

680
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:37,490
She's like, I won't, I don't reveal secrets.

681
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,510
Vienna did the tutorial.

682
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:55,130
I just hear, I hear like some...

683
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:56,130
Oh.

684
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:58,490
Wait!

685
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,810
Oh my god, we get to get cosmetics!

686
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:01,870
Audio source.

687
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:02,870
Okay.

688
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,690
Oh my god.

689
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,790
I got Elle's laptop.

690
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,330
She's trying to communicate.

691
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:12,670
There's a mosquito in the lobby.

692
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:30,490
I have his laptop right here.

693
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:33,830
If you want to talk to Elle, come here.

694
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:37,170
I am Elle, stop impersonating me.

695
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,950
It's like so confusing that there's like...

696
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,050
Laimu is just Elle, so I'm like, wait, is Laimu Elle?

697
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,250
Press B, Vienna!

698
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,190
Press B!

699
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:50,370
I was like, oh no, not me.

700
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,470
Oh, no, it's not me.

701
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:53,830
Hold it?

702
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,470
Yeah, hold it and talk.

703
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:56,070
Oh, that works.

704
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,750
Vienna, what happened?

705
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,690
She was talking earlier to me.

706
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:05,750
She was talking earlier.

707
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,750
Oh, no!

708
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:08,710
It's Morse code.

709
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:09,750
It's Morse code.

710
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,630
I just want to know how she did it.

711
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:16,030
How did she do it?

712
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,470
I want to know her secrets.

713
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:21,650
She's so good.

714
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:26,590
I was actually playing the tutorials and stuff before we started, and it's like one of the only people that did that.

715
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,170
Oh my god.

716
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,450
I played the tutorials.

717
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,310
Oh, no!

718
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,990
Oh, she's going so hard.

719
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,810
I sabotaged her so she couldn't explain anything.

720
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,110
Kira's got her.

721
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:46,150
That's a real death note.

722
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,110
Oh my god.

723
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:57,310
If you go to customize, and go to cut-ins, and you see last words, I got one that was like, I'll post your name on the internet.

724
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:58,650
I'm gonna die.

725
00:37:59,350 --> 00:37:59,870
Why?

726
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,710
If you die...

727
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,910
I think if you get arrested, that's what you say.

728
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,170
Oh my god.

729
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,070
I love that.

730
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:09,050
The last words.

731
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:13,370
I'm gonna post your name on the internet.

732
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:14,910
Oh my god.

733
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:18,030
I would...

734
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:20,310
Wanna go for a drink after this?

735
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:22,130
Why am I rising up the...

736
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:26,510
There's one in last words that's like, kill me.

737
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:27,950
Just kill me.

738
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,250
Just kill me.

739
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:34,170
There's one for Elle that says, am I a freak?

740
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:36,830
Warning.

741
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,000
I am not.

742
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,600
Oh my god.

743
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,260
Oh my gosh, these nameplates are so...

744
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,160
Are your guys' like, sounds in English or Japanese?

745
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,200
Does it...

746
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,320
Mine is in Japanese.

747
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,380
I think there's only Japanese.

748
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,420
Only, I think.

749
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,140
Oh yeah, we found out that this game is not available in Japan.

750
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:00,600
Yeah.

751
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,060
Is it in Japanese?

752
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,320
Yeah.

753
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:10,300
I asked Henya if she wanted to join, and she was like, the game's not available for me.

754
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,240
Not available in Japan.

755
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,340
You know how many games I've tried to play with her, and she's like, I can't play it because I'm in Japan.

756
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,220
That's so sad.

757
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,260
Why is it Reason exclusive when it's literally Death Note?

758
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,340
In Japanese, too.

759
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,540
The dumbest in Japanese audio.

760
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,400
I guess they don't want to play Among Us.

761
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,160
Yeah, yeah.

762
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,020
Only it's Nostalgia Bay for us.

763
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,000
Oh yeah.

764
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,500
Okay, Vienna's restarting the game.

765
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,240
I like how she tried to tell us a couple of times, and it was just...

766
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,240
I was like, I think I'm starting to understand.

767
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:08,020
Yeah, can't Kira like, coordinate between all of you guys and like, talk to you in secret?

768
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,680
Yeah, that's what we were doing.

769
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,180
It worked earlier.

770
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,260
We were like, talking to each other.

771
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,440
We were handing the notebooks to each other.

772
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,140
We were just like...

773
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,300
I am Kira from the great beyond.

774
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,740
Can we actually talk over like, a loudspeaker?

775
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,800
Like, everyone hears you?

776
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,800
No, only the good team or the bad team hears you.

777
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,520
So Kira can only talk to the killer people.

778
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,260
Kira can only talk to the aligned people.

779
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,900
And Elle can talk to the investigators.

780
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,660
I was Elle, and I knew how to look through the camera.

781
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,180
So I was able to like, see those.

782
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,740
But I don't know how to talk to everyone.

783
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,000
I'm looking out for Kira followers.

784
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:43,820
Actually, no.

785
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,760
I think two was enough.

786
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,720
I mean, we literally got Elle the first time.

787
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,340
Can you hear me now?

788
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,680
Yeah, we can hear you!

789
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,420
Tell us your secrets!

790
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,160
How did you know?

791
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:59,080
I stole Giga's ID, and then wrote her name in the book, and she was Elle.

792
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,140
So we won.

793
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,040
Masterful Giga.

794
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,660
The one person you stole.

795
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,000
People are just going to spend the entire time sprinting away from you.

796
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,300
Alright, alright.

797
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,340
I find it funny that anybody who...

798
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,620
gets so much close to me, I'm just like, you're fucking dead.

799
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:20,220
You have to be Kira.

800
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:26,220
I was like, it's chill if I write her name down, right?

801
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,080
So it was just a lucky guess?

802
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,700
Yeah, it was just a lucky guess.

803
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:38,960
So like, there's tasks where investigators have to be next to a person, so an investigator could be next to a person just investigating them.

804
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,640
So it throws you off.

805
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:41,720
Are you guys ready?

806
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,420
Let's do it again.

807
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,100
Alright, here we go.

808
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,500
Alright,

809
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,160
I picked... I'm not Kira this time.

810
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,000
I wanna be a hot girl.

811
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,580
You wanna be Misa?

812
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,220
Yeah.

813
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,060
I wanna be a goth girl.

814
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,660
Being Kira is stressful.

815
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,480
I think 2v8 is fine.

816
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,960
Yeah, she kept like, passing it.

817
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:15,840
Passing it.

818
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,080
Alright, I'm an investigator.

819
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:20,840
Wait, who's L?

820
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,160
Who's L then?

821
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,260
Oh no.

822
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,590
Hot investigator.

823
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:35,730
Oh, hey.

824
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:37,370
Hi.

825
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:41,710
Yeah, I'm a hot investigator too.

826
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:43,170
I doubt that.

827
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:44,370
Oh yeah, I'm gonna write your name.

828
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:47,470
I'm gonna put your name on the internet.

829
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:48,570
I'm coming over, I'm coming over.

830
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:50,070
Coming over.

831
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:52,450
Wait, what's happening?

832
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:54,250
Death note test.

833
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:57,550
Oh, we got fixed it.

834
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:02,290
Oh, resolve the incident to prevent the new world.

835
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:02,910
I'm resolving.

836
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,530
Somebody else help me resolve.

837
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:11,430
Oh, I'm still resolving.

838
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:12,390
A body was found.

839
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:14,070
A body was found at the meeting room.

840
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:15,730
We know L!

841
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:16,610
We know!

842
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:19,750
Sure.

843
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:22,150
I'm still...

844
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:22,790
Please!

845
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:24,750
It's just me!

846
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:28,710
I'm still trying to resolve!

847
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:32,930
By 10?

848
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:34,330
There's no way.

849
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:35,170
Do I make it?

850
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:37,270
There's no way!

851
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:38,970
Oh, 3, 2...

852
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:39,470
Oh, I got it!

853
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:40,430
I just got it in time.

854
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:41,150
Oh, thank god.

855
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:43,190
I literally just got it in time.

856
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:43,750
I did it.

857
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:44,250
I'm a hero.

858
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:45,930
Oh, Snuffy, what are you doing over here?

859
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:48,610
I was following the little alert thing.

860
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:48,970
Yeah?

861
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:50,310
Oh, whoa, whoa.

862
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:51,350
Yeah, I just did it.

863
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:53,590
I had to do it by myself.

864
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:54,830
Oh, hello.

865
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:55,750
Investigate.

866
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:59,550
No one's been by today before you got here.

867
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:01,010
Okay, no one's been here.

868
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:02,270
So we're fine.

869
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:04,230
Oh...

870
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:06,530
A little...

871
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:08,410
Hmm...

872
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:09,530
Let's see...

873
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:11,390
Okay, we got the testimonies here.

874
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:13,550
Wait, they already have one!

875
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:16,170
Whoa, whoa!

876
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:16,950
Why is there so many people?

877
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:17,590
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

878
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:18,550
Why are you getting close to me?

879
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:22,010
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

880
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:22,870
Why are you getting close?

881
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:24,170
Six feet, six feet!

882
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:29,770
People keep giving me lost items.

883
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:31,530
I don't know what it means.

884
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:33,410
Okay, I need a monitor.

885
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:36,190
Alright, where's LimeMoon?

886
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:37,370
I need a monitor here.

887
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:38,950
Like a good investigator.

888
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:42,390
Oh...

889
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:43,670
Oh!

890
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:49,310
It's Snuffy!

891
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:49,730
It's Snuffy!

892
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:50,130
It's Snuffy!

893
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:51,450
I saw her open the notebook!

894
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:53,070
I saw her open the notebook!

895
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:54,110
I saw her open the notebook!

896
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:54,650
It's Snuffy!

897
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:55,750
It's Snuffy!

898
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:56,270
It's Snuffy!

899
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:57,350
We got a trial meeting!

900
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:03,570
It's Snuffy!

901
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:05,070
Snuffy, what were you doing?

902
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:07,490
I was reading my notebook.

903
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:11,710
Is it possibly a black notebook?

904
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:15,070
It was my investigation notebook.

905
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:17,230
Why would you walk so close to me?

906
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:19,660
Oh...

907
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:21,290
SodaScar...

908
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:22,710
SodaScar...

909
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:23,390
I have a problem.

910
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:26,450
Hmm...

911
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:30,350
I...

912
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:32,010
Didn't know how to.

913
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:37,830
That's a very lucky...

914
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:39,450
That's a very likely story.

915
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:44,350
Yeah, but there's...

916
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:46,710
There's a Kira follower too.

917
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:48,430
My ID was stolen!

918
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:49,550
Oh my god!

919
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:52,370
Okay, so, I...

920
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:56,390
I think it's Snuffy.

921
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:59,790
Because I saw her bring up the notebook...

922
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,990
In the corner as if she was hiding something.

923
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:03,870
And I think that notebook...

924
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:05,590
I think that notebook was black.

925
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:07,510
No-no.

926
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:09,050
I saw it was a black notebook.

927
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:13,310
Aymo, did you steal my notebook?

928
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:22,610
Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you, Kira?

929
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:24,270
Yeah,

930
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:40,750
I was resolving the last body by myself because Mint walked away.

931
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:44,950
She walked away.

932
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,610
There's still a follower out there!

933
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:56,130
We gotta get all of them, and I remember before she was like, I wanna be just like Misa.

934
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:58,690
My ID was stolen.

935
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:03,370
My social security is on the line right now.

936
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:09,350
I think there's more to worry about than your social security if it got stolen.

937
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:16,270
Vote for Limu because you had a little magnifying glass after you walked by me.

938
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:17,670
You were looking at my ID.

939
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:22,030
I lost nothing!

940
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:23,730
You lost your ID!

941
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:24,630
What do you mean?

942
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:26,870
Oh, I lost my ID.

943
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:27,430
That's right.

944
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:28,690
Is it in your bag now?

945
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:31,890
Cause I gave you an item and I got experience for doing it.

946
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:33,190
Oh, I have... Oh, wait.

947
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:34,550
No, I have no items.

948
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:36,170
Oh...

949
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:40,150
I also had a prompt to deliver Minto a lost item.

950
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:42,570
Wait, maybe she just keeps losing her ID.

951
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:44,470
Everybody has my ID, apparently.

952
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:44,990
Whoa!

953
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:51,330
It's like... It's like you want to get killed.

954
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:53,270
Yeah, I voted for Snuffy.

955
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:56,870
Yeah, Snuffy.

956
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:58,130
Defend yourself.

957
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:06,470
Yeah?

958
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:06,510
Yeah?

959
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:13,430
You know, I didn't... Oh, wait.

960
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:15,470
Who was gonna confiscate the item?

961
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:16,290
Me.

962
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:16,790
What items?

963
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:17,750
I'm good.

964
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:19,110
No, don't give it to Doki.

965
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:19,750
What do you mean?

966
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:20,990
I'm the one that called her out.

967
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:23,190
What the... Who's that?

968
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:24,710
Who is this?

969
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:31,370
Oh, is it Snuffy?

970
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:33,370
One...

971
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:33,870
Oh my god.

972
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:37,090
Why are they zooming in on the face?

973
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:38,290
Oh, they're publishing the name.

974
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:39,190
I knew it!

975
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:40,270
I knew!

976
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:43,680
Oh my god!

977
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:44,260
Oh my god!

978
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,940
Those live reactions.

979
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,420
That's right.

980
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:51,940
Snuffy was killed.

981
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:55,200
Oh, yeah.

982
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,200
Woo!

983
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,380
We won!

984
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:59,140
We did it!

985
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:01,160
Okay, I'm gonna increase the...

986
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:01,980
I got a match.

987
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:02,520
I got a...

988
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:03,720
And I don't know what to do!

989
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:06,820
Okay, I'll...

990
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,880
I'll add more Akira followers.

991
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:12,160
Really?

992
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:13,040
Okay, you can do that?

993
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:13,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

994
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:14,720
I can increase it.

995
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:16,440
Okay, glasses.

996
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,680
Oh my god, his last word.

997
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:18,020
Okay.

998
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:18,920
My apologies, Snuffy.

999
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,200
I wasn't good enough.

1000
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:20,900
That's okay!

1001
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,560
It was the first time trying to figure it out.

1002
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,060
Yeah, I like how...

1003
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:26,220
I didn't know it would just be so obvious.

1004
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,540
I tried to hide in the corner.

1005
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,080
And, like, away from the camera.

1006
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:32,220
It just, like, it's so obvious if you're looking at it.

1007
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,540
Yeah, I was just like, what are you doing in the corner?

1008
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,820
You have to do, like, the same, like, button thing.

1009
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:42,000
I think I would just have to click on something, but you have to do, like, a button.

1010
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,020
Okay, let's see.

1011
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:47,220
Like, if you want to go kill somebody, make sure you're, like, ready to do, like, a...

1012
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,860
Like, a quick button press.

1013
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,100
Like, the W-W-B thing.

1014
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:50,680
Okay, okay.

1015
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:52,040
Q-T-E that shit.

1016
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,740
I feel like the map isn't big enough.

1017
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,840
Like, we're always bumping into each other.

1018
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:59,220
I think there is different... I don't know if there's a different map now.

1019
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,640
I'm checking the settings right now.

1020
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:04,440
The first part with the body thing, what even was that?

1021
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,220
Oh, you...

1022
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,060
I don't know.

1023
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:12,980
It was, like, a bunch of crimes, but the amount of time we had to resolve the crimes was fucking minuscule.

1024
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,560
So, it was, like, impossible to...

1025
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:16,900
Can they do that?

1026
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,420
Oh, I can make it so every player has black notebooks.

1027
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:22,760
Oh, that's good.

1028
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:23,780
Yeah, I'm gonna add that.

1029
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,220
All players have black notebooks.

1030
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:26,380
So, like, people will be like...

1031
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:28,140
Oh, we totally know how to play this game.

1032
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,440
So, that was really easy to learn.

1033
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:31,640
Serious, let's see.

1034
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,080
We're still figuring it out.

1035
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:35,460
I'm sure if we get a round or two, we'll get the hang of it.

1036
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1037
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,580
Okay, let's see.

1038
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:40,440
We're 1-1 right now for bad and good guys.

1039
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,420
I'm gonna turn down the meeting hours.

1040
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:43,920
So, less discussion.

1041
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,120
Yeah.

1042
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:45,500
Okay.

1043
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:50,480
Does the notebooks look different than the death note?

1044
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,020
Well, yeah, they do.

1045
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,360
Not anymore.

1046
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:53,940
Not anymore.

1047
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:55,280
I made it so they're all black.

1048
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:56,880
Yeah, they're all gonna be...

1049
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,140
Yeah, yeah.

1050
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,620
So, we take our notebooks out.

1051
00:50:58,660 --> 00:50:59,480
It's gonna be, like, black.

1052
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,480
So, we don't know if it's an actual death note or not.

1053
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:02,340
Okay, okay.

1054
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:04,120
I'm gonna check if there's other settings.

1055
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:08,940
Is there a way to increase the time for the sabotage?

1056
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,380
Whatever happened?

1057
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,400
The sabotage?

1058
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,460
Oh, like, when...

1059
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:13,040
A round increase would be good.

1060
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,180
A round increase time would be nice.

1061
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,280
Okay, increasing the round.

1062
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:18,320
Uh...

1063
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:18,960
Day, night?

1064
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:20,060
I think that's it.

1065
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,120
I'll do 90 seconds.

1066
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:23,140
Okay, let's try it.

1067
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:25,320
90 seconds, and then...

1068
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,720
I'm checking if there's anything else.

1069
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:28,560
Uh...

1070
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,760
I think we could do that for now, and then we'll adjust the settings later.

1071
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:33,580
Okay.

1072
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:34,980
Alright.

1073
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,760
Alright, starting now.

1074
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:40,000
Woohoo!

1075
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:40,800
Let's go!

1076
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:41,600
Woohoo!

1077
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,540
Oh, I could...

1078
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:44,320
Oh, I think...

1079
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,220
Oh, I can turn off role selection next game.

1080
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:47,900
Oh, wait.

1081
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:52,540
I don't think it matters though, because every time I've pressed Kira follower, nothing happens.

1082
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:53,340
No!

1083
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:55,440
Oh, wait!

1084
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,500
Is this what you want, but it won't always give it to you, I guess?

1085
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1086
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,980
Oh, I never press confirm!

1087
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:02,540
Oh my God.

1088
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:09,870
Okay.

1089
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:10,970
A rescue...

1090
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:11,510
Alright.

1091
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:13,650
This time, it's so easy.

1092
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:21,680
Oh.

1093
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,300
Hello, Snuffy.

1094
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:27,820
Hello.

1095
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:28,800
Why are you running away?

1096
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:29,160
Whoa.

1097
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:30,360
Whoa.

1098
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:32,080
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1099
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,900
Why did you just walk closer to me, huh?

1100
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:35,740
No, no, no.

1101
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:36,320
I was...

1102
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,260
I just wanted to say hi.

1103
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:41,080
Okay, I gotta question some NPCs.

1104
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:44,460
Oh, are you guys questioning NPCs?

1105
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:46,800
Oh.

1106
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,260
Oh, hello.

1107
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,200
Oh, are you interrogating them?

1108
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,680
Okay, I'm gonna interrogate them too.

1109
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,160
No one stopped by.

1110
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:57,960
Okay.

1111
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:59,120
Where's the other...

1112
00:52:59,120 --> 00:52:59,960
Where's the other guy?

1113
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:03,120
Yeah, she's a little sussy there.

1114
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:04,020
She was.

1115
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:06,840
W-S.

1116
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:07,940
Nice.

1117
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,660
No one's been here.

1118
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,640
Uh, hint?

1119
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,940
Okay, I have...

1120
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:17,580
There's nothing not good intel.

1121
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:18,220
Whoa!

1122
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,200
Whoa!

1123
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,540
What are you trying to do, Amelie?

1124
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:22,880
Huh?

1125
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,960
What are you trying to...

1126
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:25,900
What's your task?

1127
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,000
What's your task?

1128
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:28,140
What's your task?

1129
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:29,340
I'm a little investigator.

1130
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:30,800
This is my weapon of choice.

1131
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,140
This is my weapon of choice.

1132
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:36,360
Every...

1133
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,100
How did you get that?

1134
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,460
I leveled up.

1135
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,140
I've got an anime by my side.

1136
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:43,680
I pay to win.

1137
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:48,060
I completed my task, but no one's dead yet.

1138
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:52,020
Oh?

1139
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:54,820
Can contact...

1140
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:56,780
To publicly reveal their role?

1141
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,480
Stuffy, reveal yourself!

1142
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:03,300
Oh, Limus!

1143
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,640
Limus...

1144
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,520
Limus investigator, she's safe.

1145
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,620
She's safe.

1146
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:14,860
Oh no.

1147
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:15,840
Nothing?

1148
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,300
I have surveyed.

1149
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,420
Okay, let's see.

1150
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,920
I still have my ID card.

1151
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:28,520
My task list.

1152
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,660
Okay, I need to question some NPCs.

1153
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:32,980
Hey guys.

1154
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:36,080
Limus is safe, so we don't have to worry about her.

1155
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:37,640
Oh, hey.

1156
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,520
I'm just interrogating.

1157
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,220
Nothing suspicious.

1158
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:46,840
Who did she see?

1159
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,460
Before you two people came by.

1160
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:54,060
No, no, no.

1161
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,240
It might be still him, but that means it's still with me.

1162
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:02,100
It has Sans Undertale on it.

1163
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,180
What?

1164
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,700
Where's the last investigation?

1165
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,860
Where's the last witness?

1166
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:10,920
Here?

1167
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:11,760
Oh, there you are.

1168
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,000
Who else talked to you?

1169
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:16,260
Three people?

1170
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:17,820
Oh my god, you whore.

1171
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:18,580
Okay.

1172
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,300
Whoa, all of you guys.

1173
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:26,040
Hey guys.

1174
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,780
What did you guys do for your task?

1175
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:29,300
Huh?

1176
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,080
I wanted to just see something.

1177
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,780
Put your names on the internet.

1178
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:37,140
Oh no!

1179
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:40,920
No!

1180
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:45,800
What the hell?

1181
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,380
What happened?

1182
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,180
Oh my god.

1183
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,000
No!

1184
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:50,880
Lime!

1185
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,280
Not Lime, bro.

1186
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:56,480
Oh my god.

1187
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:57,180
Oh my god.

1188
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,020
What did we do?

1189
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:01,200
Okay, who specified that she had such a horrible death?

1190
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:06,020
Yeah, literally could've picked heart attack.

1191
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:09,360
She's gonna post her names on the internet.

1192
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:11,560
Oh my god.

1193
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:16,760
I was accusing Lime for standing too close to me and then the next second a car hit her.

1194
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:21,280
We literally saw that she's an investigator.

1195
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,060
Yeah, we saw that.

1196
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,100
Yeah.

1197
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:28,200
Maybe you were in the notebook.

1198
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,680
I can't believe she got e-cigar.

1199
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:31,580
Speak up.

1200
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,220
A dying message.

1201
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,940
My ID was stolen.

1202
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:38,060
My ID was stolen too!

1203
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:40,320
That'll do it, bro.

1204
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:41,860
Wait a minute.

1205
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:47,560
My thing says, Emily seems to have been in close contact with many people so they might be L.

1206
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:03,500
Wait, wait, who stood next to me?

1207
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:07,040
Somebody stood next to me and I was like, that'd be funny if they took my ID.

1208
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:07,860
And they did!

1209
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:08,560
Who was it?

1210
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:10,500
Uh-oh.

1211
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,240
That's your fault.

1212
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:13,300
You need to pay attention.

1213
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:14,040
Wait, I think...

1214
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,960
Because I don't have an ID either.

1215
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,860
Wait, I think it was Vienna.

1216
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:24,040
I saw someone write in a notebook right before that happened on the left side of the map.

1217
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:25,060
I was watching Doopie.

1218
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:26,300
My notebook out.

1219
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,360
Doopie always has...

1220
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,440
It's like a heart attack because everybody pulls out the death.

1221
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,740
That's really scary.

1222
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:32,660
That's very specific.

1223
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,020
I think Juniper would do something that specific.

1224
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:38,720
I wouldn't do something... I never do specific things.

1225
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:41,940
Oh, who do we vote for?

1226
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:42,680
Okay, buddy.

1227
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:43,360
I don't know.

1228
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:44,620
I'm skipping.

1229
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:45,880
I'm skipping.

1230
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:46,880
I'm skipping.

1231
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,800
My God, somebody actually died and now we're not, like, accusing somebody right now.

1232
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,380
Look at me, I have this camera.

1233
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,080
I literally accused somebody.

1234
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:55,540
No one was arrested.

1235
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:01,340
Snuffy, was it you?

1236
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:02,200
Did you take my ID?

1237
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:03,560
Was it you?

1238
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:05,440
Was it you, Snuffy?

1239
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,380
You already took my ID.

1240
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,680
I can stand next to you now.

1241
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:10,620
You wanna kill me, right, Snuffy?

1242
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:12,160
You wanna do it?

1243
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:13,160
You wanna do it?

1244
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:13,660
Why are you running away?

1245
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:17,000
I don't have an ID.

1246
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:18,080
Why are you running away?

1247
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,280
Snuffy, I'm calling for you.

1248
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:29,790
Okay, we have surveillance cameras.

1249
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:32,430
Oh God, we gotta help Elle.

1250
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:33,990
We gotta help our guy.

1251
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:40,690
Okay, I'm gonna head over here first.

1252
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:41,490
I'm gonna talk to him.

1253
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:44,150
Okay, nice.

1254
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:45,430
Supposedly...

1255
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:46,790
Wait, supposedly someone handed... What?

1256
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:53,110
Supposedly, I saw someone handing off an ID during the day at the street near the park convenience store?

1257
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:54,530
Wait a minute.

1258
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:01,850
Somebody was... Oh, that's where Lime died.

1259
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:03,330
Right here.

1260
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:06,650
Yeah.

1261
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:11,090
Oh?

1262
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:12,790
What's that?

1263
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:14,790
Death note test.

1264
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:16,570
Oh, oh, oh!

1265
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:18,130
We gotta do it!

1266
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:19,470
We gotta go, we gotta go, we gotta go!

1267
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:26,330
We have to... Just go, just go, just go!

1268
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:27,910
There's a dead body.

1269
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:32,010
Okay, if there's two of us resolving, it'll be faster.

1270
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:34,450
It's okay, I don't have an ID, so I trust you.

1271
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:38,010
Wait, your ID was stolen too?

1272
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:40,130
Yeah, everything's stolen.

1273
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:43,050
I had Lime's notebook and it wouldn't let me open it.

1274
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:45,590
So I can't even tell you what was inside.

1275
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:46,870
Wait, no, you have to give it to L!

1276
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:51,450
Wait, wait, Snuffy, Snuffy, why weren't you saying anything when you did all that?

1277
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:52,450
Snuffy, you're so quiet.

1278
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:54,730
Snuffy?

1279
00:59:54,930 --> 00:59:55,570
Snuffy, what's going on?

1280
00:59:55,710 --> 00:59:56,370
Yeah, what's going on?

1281
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:58,230
What are the vibes right now?

1282
00:59:58,310 --> 00:59:59,290
Snuffy, are you muted?

1283
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:00,270
You're not pressing V.

1284
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:04,270
Oh, Snuffy is a little too quiet.

1285
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:04,930
Snuffy?

1286
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:06,990
Oh God, she's trying to get rid of us.

1287
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:07,610
Oh, Snuffy?

1288
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:08,930
I'm taking notes right now.

1289
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:09,730
I'm taking your notes.

1290
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:11,650
I'm gonna take notes over your notes.

1291
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:14,790
I think she wrote our names, Val!

1292
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:22,890
I think it's... I think it's Snuffy.

1293
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:23,630
I think it's Snuffy.

1294
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:25,430
You're so sus right now, Snuffy.

1295
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:26,530
You're not saying anything.

1296
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:31,690
Yeah, give item back.

1297
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:33,210
Who do I give this item to?

1298
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:33,750
Thank you.

1299
01:00:35,610 --> 01:00:36,130
Oh.

1300
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:38,450
God, lost item.

1301
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:39,730
Whose items is this?

1302
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,370
Grimmy, Grimmy, here's an item!

1303
01:00:45,490 --> 01:00:47,190
I'm here to get... You lose something!

1304
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:50,270
Okay, nice.

1305
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:52,230
I already have my ID stolen, so you don't have to worry.

1306
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:55,310
Okay.

1307
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:57,070
We go this way.

1308
01:00:57,970 --> 01:01:00,130
How can you steal my ID twice?

1309
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:07,710
Supposedly, someone's talking during the day at a street near the classroom cafe.

1310
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:10,910
Where's the...

1311
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:16,810
Why are you guys just... Are you guys on transmitter talking to each other right now, right here?

1312
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:22,430
Are you guys... Are you guys on... Are you guys out here on the corner?

1313
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:24,190
Yeah.

1314
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:26,410
Yeah.

1315
01:01:29,330 --> 01:01:31,350
My ID is already stolen.

1316
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:32,450
I have no fear.

1317
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:34,250
I know I'm gonna die anyway.

1318
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:37,610
What?

1319
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:38,610
How?

1320
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:45,270
Who is that?

1321
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:50,070
Oh yeah, someone's a mosquito again.

1322
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:57,430
Oh my...

1323
01:01:57,430 --> 01:02:07,290
I fucking knew it!

1324
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:08,370
I knew it, Snuffy!

1325
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:14,570
I said Snuffy!

1326
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:16,210
I called her out!

1327
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:19,930
Snuffy couldn't hear you guys for what it was worth.

1328
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:21,710
Like, she said she couldn't hear you.

1329
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:22,530
Oh, really?

1330
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:25,530
I was really scared that that was like a feature if I was Kida.

1331
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:30,650
Cause like, I could only hear when Vienna talked to me over the communications, but everybody else was dead silent.

1332
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:31,530
I couldn't hear anybody.

1333
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:32,890
Oh, that's weird.

1334
01:02:33,970 --> 01:02:35,650
I don't think that's supposed to happen.

1335
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:36,830
Yeah, I don't think that was...

1336
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:39,790
Cause I could talk to people.

1337
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:45,150
I kept trying to go around being like, I can't hear anybody.

1338
01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:46,890
I'm sorry, but I just...

1339
01:02:48,350 --> 01:02:51,850
Yeah, I was like trying to call you out and you wouldn't respond.

1340
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:55,070
Alright,

1341
01:02:59,270 --> 01:02:59,590
let's see.

1342
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:01,630
Should we turn down the day-night cycle?

1343
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:02,730
I can hear you fine.

1344
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:03,550
Is that okay?

1345
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:06,670
Did we turn down the day-night?

1346
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:08,990
Yeah, I think it was alright.

1347
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:12,870
Let's see what other stuff I can adjust.

1348
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:14,870
I know we can like do a...

1349
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:21,370
You don't have to choose what you want to be.

1350
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:25,730
Where is it though?

1351
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:27,630
What's the setting chat in?

1352
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:29,770
Like investigator and it was just like you.

1353
01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:34,550
No, I picked follower and it made me Kira and I was like, what?

1354
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:35,510
I didn't even pick this.

1355
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:38,070
Okay.

1356
01:03:38,890 --> 01:03:40,830
No problem, I've done it before.

1357
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:42,530
Where's the randomizer?

1358
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:44,390
Wait, who?

1359
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:45,290
Who's?

1360
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:45,950
Who's?

1361
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:48,670
Oh, yeah.

1362
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:51,530
Should I...

1363
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:52,110
Oh, wait.

1364
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:54,790
Kira got her.

1365
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:55,710
Kira.

1366
01:03:58,310 --> 01:04:00,150
I have to apologize to her.

1367
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:01,110
She has to come back.

1368
01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:04,110
Where the fuck is...

1369
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:05,710
Did you hear my epic music though?

1370
01:04:06,070 --> 01:04:06,730
Yeah, it was good.

1371
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:07,490
It was good.

1372
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:13,290
Alright, I've got the randomizer on so it'll randomly give you roles.

1373
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:14,450
Okay.

1374
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:17,050
Let's see.

1375
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:22,290
Nobody point fingers at me because, you know, the laws of probability would say that I wouldn't be Kira again.

1376
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:24,870
We'll vote Snuffy out first.

1377
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:33,290
Now he'll be a liable partner, you know, so you'll be like, dang, Snuffy could be Elle, which means she's gigabrain and super cool and...

1378
01:04:34,930 --> 01:04:41,970
I realized I accidentally outed myself because I said something only the Shinigami can tell you about Amelie and nobody noticed.

1379
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:44,490
Literally, it's our third game.

1380
01:04:44,570 --> 01:04:45,400
I don't think we could...

1381
01:04:46,570 --> 01:04:48,710
Yeah, I'm pretty sure nobody fucking knows.

1382
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:49,250
It's okay.

1383
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:53,170
We're all learning live as we go along.

1384
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:58,270
So be careful if you're the bad guy.

1385
01:05:01,070 --> 01:05:03,410
If that was okay, I hope Kira didn't...

1386
01:05:03,410 --> 01:05:06,670
I can't... Okay, wait, Snuffy, so you killed Lime like that?

1387
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:10,490
Yeah, that's so fu... Lime, how does that feel?

1388
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:14,590
I swiped my ID because I had to investigate her, which meant that I was like cuddling up real close.

1389
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:16,250
Yeah, I think it's definitely...

1390
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:18,250
I just miss Lime's...

1391
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:23,790
I definitely think it's really hard with... It's like... I don't know how to describe it.

1392
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:31,810
It's really hard with the notebooks or without them because then everybody's pulling out the death note and I could probably just kill somebody in front of everybody and nobody could ever like question that.

1393
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:32,770
Oh, true.

1394
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:37,010
So you want me to turn...

1395
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:40,670
I feel like Kira's...

1396
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:43,830
I think you should probably run away or have to hide to do the death noting thing.

1397
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:48,950
Alright, I'm gonna... Okay, I turned the notebooks back to...

1398
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:51,990
Like Kira... Only Kira is black notebook then, yeah.

1399
01:05:52,550 --> 01:05:55,890
So right now it's kind of like... Kira can just get lucky.

1400
01:05:56,170 --> 01:05:56,690
Yeah, yeah.

1401
01:05:57,570 --> 01:06:03,650
He just looks at everybody putting out the notebook and he's like, I'm gonna write people's names right now in front of everybody.

1402
01:06:04,430 --> 01:06:08,010
I'm just running around being like, I can't hear anything and...

1403
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:11,570
Oh, apparently...

1404
01:06:11,570 --> 01:06:12,990
That might not be...

1405
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:18,330
Apparently, Bao might not be back, guys.

1406
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:19,010
So I guess we'll...

1407
01:06:19,790 --> 01:06:21,170
We'll start it off then.

1408
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:23,170
Alright, here we go.

1409
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:30,590
Oh, I'm an investigator.

1410
01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:31,810
You're a random fuck.

1411
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:35,550
I just want to give other people a chance to play.

1412
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:37,970
I don't want to be Kira or Elle.

1413
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:42,760
Yeah, Bao, there's something...

1414
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:44,580
Uh...

1415
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:46,760
Your internet died, so...

1416
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:51,020
Hello, I'm proximity voice.

1417
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:52,840
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1418
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:55,220
What if I take your ID card right now?

1419
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:59,920
I'm gonna impersonate you right here.

1420
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,460
Identity theft is not a joke.

1421
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:06,760
Alright, let's see...

1422
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:10,180
Question, NPC... Oh, that's one of them.

1423
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,280
They say like stuff like...

1424
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:14,420
Oh, uh...

1425
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:16,740
Somebody did this at this time.

1426
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,260
And like, how am I supposed to know?

1427
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:20,140
How am I supposed to know that?

1428
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:21,340
Like, who did that?

1429
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,960
Like, I don't have the brains to figure that out.

1430
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:26,940
Hey, where's Grimmy?

1431
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:28,540
Oh, whoa, whoa.

1432
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,560
Grimmy, I'm gonna need to stand next to you.

1433
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:32,320
I need to monitor you.

1434
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:33,000
It's monitoring.

1435
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:33,980
Alright.

1436
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:39,140
Grimmy and Snuff... You two were close to me.

1437
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:40,520
What do you want?

1438
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:40,840
What do you want?

1439
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:41,120
What do you want?

1440
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:42,180
Not long enough, though.

1441
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:43,580
I mean, if you really think about it...

1442
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:44,760
Yeah, I'm gonna investigate you, too.

1443
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:47,060
I'm gonna...

1444
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:49,760
Lime, wouldn't it be funny if you were Kira?

1445
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:54,540
You're the only person I stood next to, so my ID is gone.

1446
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:56,040
Yeah.

1447
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:57,420
Yeah, wouldn't that be funny?

1448
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,020
Why are you guys kissing?

1449
01:07:58,280 --> 01:07:59,460
I have my eye on you and Grimmy.

1450
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:00,860
I'm just saying...

1451
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:02,880
She's trying to mind game me.

1452
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,200
I'm saying that like...

1453
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:09,140
This is the only person I stood next to, so like, if something happens, if my ID is gone, I'm just saying...

1454
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:10,620
Okay, okay, okay.

1455
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:13,780
Okay, get away.

1456
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:14,540
Get away.

1457
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,420
Don't be sussy right now.

1458
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,560
I'm writing it down.

1459
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:20,140
I'm writing it down.

1460
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:21,580
I'm writing it down.

1461
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:24,200
I wrote your name down.

1462
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:30,120
I received a lost item.

1463
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:31,440
Oh, thank you.

1464
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:36,160
Okay, who talked to you, sir?

1465
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:39,500
Two people came to him.

1466
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:40,060
Okay.

1467
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:46,240
I like how useless the fucking testimony is.

1468
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:46,820
Yeah, I know.

1469
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:48,420
They're like, four people.

1470
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:51,700
Yes, it's like, what am I supposed to do with that information?

1471
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:52,920
They like, walked up to him.

1472
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:53,880
What am I supposed to do?

1473
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:56,660
I think it's like, L.

1474
01:08:56,820 --> 01:08:58,000
I think you have to tell L.

1475
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:02,080
Like, they'll be like, oh, I saw somebody at this location, and you have to tell L to like, check the camera.

1476
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:02,960
Yeah, but who's L?

1477
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:03,620
Are you L?

1478
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,260
You have... No, you have to...

1479
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:11,240
Oh, okay, I need to go here.

1480
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:12,140
Who am I monitoring?

1481
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,100
Okay, who am I monitoring?

1482
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:18,820
Amelie.

1483
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,140
Okay, where's Amelie?

1484
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:22,580
Oh, make room for me.

1485
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:24,000
Why are you in the corner down there?

1486
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:24,960
Huh?

1487
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,380
Why are you in the corner down there, huh?

1488
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:29,220
Are you trying to write in the notebook in the corner?

1489
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:30,940
Is that what you're trying to do?

1490
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:32,480
That feels weird.

1491
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:35,900
Damn, it feels a little sussy for you to be in that corner by yourself.

1492
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:37,000
Oh!

1493
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:39,920
Oh, death note test?

1494
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:40,940
What's that?

1495
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:43,100
Resolve incidents?

1496
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:44,180
Oh...

1497
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:48,700
Okay, okay, okay, I'm resolving right here.

1498
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:51,440
Oh, Doopie, I don't like how you're so close to me.

1499
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:54,660
Where's the...

1500
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:55,640
It's over here.

1501
01:09:59,250 --> 01:09:59,990
Hello, Vienna.

1502
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,670
Let's resolve stuff together.

1503
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:05,330
Wait a minute.

1504
01:10:08,230 --> 01:10:09,270
Wait a minute.

1505
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:11,750
Wait a minute.

1506
01:10:11,930 --> 01:10:14,990
There was another person next to me and they're not next to me anymore.

1507
01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:21,790
There were people next to... Oh!

1508
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:23,590
They get the last one.

1509
01:10:23,690 --> 01:10:24,830
We didn't do the last one.

1510
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:25,510
Oh, did it!

1511
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:26,690
It's solved!

1512
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:27,370
Oh my gosh.

1513
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:28,290
Oh my god, that was close.

1514
01:10:29,070 --> 01:10:29,750
That was close.

1515
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:33,390
Any up... Amelie and Grimmie's voice.

1516
01:10:33,490 --> 01:10:34,210
Okay, give me a sec.

1517
01:10:34,590 --> 01:10:35,690
I'm standing in this corner.

1518
01:10:35,830 --> 01:10:36,850
I think I still have my ID.

1519
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:38,890
There's no way.

1520
01:10:40,730 --> 01:10:42,330
What are you doing next to me?

1521
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:42,890
What are you...

1522
01:10:42,890 --> 01:10:45,130
I'm trying to up my volume.

1523
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:46,130
What are you doing?

1524
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:47,610
Me?

1525
01:10:47,950 --> 01:10:48,750
Yeah, what are you doing?

1526
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:50,350
I wasn't next to you.

1527
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:51,490
I was in a storage closet.

1528
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:56,770
Oh, did Kira do anything?

1529
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:02,770
We killed one criminal.

1530
01:11:05,210 --> 01:11:06,150
Isn't that good?

1531
01:11:06,150 --> 01:11:07,650
Yeah, it's good for Kira.

1532
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:11,510
No, we're trying to stop them from killing criminals.

1533
01:11:11,890 --> 01:11:13,130
That's the whole point.

1534
01:11:19,790 --> 01:11:22,510
Oh my gosh, my ID was stolen.

1535
01:11:23,550 --> 01:11:24,310
Oh my god.

1536
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:25,550
There goes my ID.

1537
01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:26,650
My ID.

1538
01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:29,830
My ID.

1539
01:11:29,970 --> 01:11:31,090
Who was it?

1540
01:11:32,010 --> 01:11:33,930
Identity fraud is not a joke.

1541
01:11:33,930 --> 01:11:37,010
It didn't get stolen, so I actually think Mintz might be Chill.

1542
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:38,570
I am Chill.

1543
01:11:38,830 --> 01:11:40,710
I had contact with a lot of people today.

1544
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:42,350
I had contact with...

1545
01:11:42,350 --> 01:11:47,030
I think, like, Grimmy, Doki, Snuffy, Amelie, and Mintz.

1546
01:11:47,090 --> 01:11:49,070
So, god fucking knows who it was.

1547
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:53,410
I had contact with the only person who didn't seem like they were near anybody.

1548
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:54,270
No, you weren't.

1549
01:11:54,290 --> 01:11:55,730
Doki's the only person I was next to.

1550
01:11:55,990 --> 01:11:56,170
No, you weren't.

1551
01:11:56,190 --> 01:11:57,310
I was literally with...

1552
01:11:57,310 --> 01:11:58,150
Doki weren't.

1553
01:11:58,230 --> 01:11:59,410
I ran away from you.

1554
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:01,770
No, I was right next to...

1555
01:12:01,770 --> 01:12:03,870
You're the only person I actually went next to.

1556
01:12:03,890 --> 01:12:04,670
No fucking...

1557
01:12:04,670 --> 01:12:07,430
Look, okay, I was next to Lime and Vienna.

1558
01:12:07,670 --> 01:12:08,990
Alright, my ID is safe.

1559
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:12,330
Okay, no one was...

1560
01:12:12,330 --> 01:12:12,470
That sounds like a scam.

1561
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:13,990
Okay.

1562
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:17,650
Alright, round two.

1563
01:12:19,650 --> 01:12:22,390
You tell me you're a hero follower, right?

1564
01:12:23,230 --> 01:12:23,710
Nope.

1565
01:12:25,450 --> 01:12:26,510
Oh, who, who?

1566
01:12:26,650 --> 01:12:26,850
Me?

1567
01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:31,070
Check that out, see that?

1568
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:32,930
No one's been here before me.

1569
01:12:33,010 --> 01:12:35,530
Oh, surveillance.

1570
01:12:37,550 --> 01:12:38,830
Don't worry, don't worry.

1571
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:40,050
L, I got you!

1572
01:12:41,610 --> 01:12:43,770
Maybe not, I don't know where it is.

1573
01:12:44,830 --> 01:12:46,790
Oh, how do I get into this room?

1574
01:12:48,810 --> 01:12:50,170
Okay, got it.

1575
01:12:51,770 --> 01:12:52,970
We're doing it.

1576
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:55,170
We're gonna save the world.

1577
01:12:55,870 --> 01:12:56,890
I need to monitor you.

1578
01:12:56,890 --> 01:12:59,070
If my ID is taken...

1579
01:12:59,070 --> 01:13:01,330
Juniper, if my ID is taken, I know why.

1580
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:02,490
Wait.

1581
01:13:07,690 --> 01:13:08,290
Alright.

1582
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:10,530
What does he have to say?

1583
01:13:12,230 --> 01:13:13,190
Before you...

1584
01:13:13,190 --> 01:13:14,510
Okay, that's so...

1585
01:13:14,510 --> 01:13:17,350
Are they gonna give us helpful things?

1586
01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:19,070
Testimonies?

1587
01:13:19,070 --> 01:13:19,950
Woah!

1588
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:24,170
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

1589
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:26,090
Okay.

1590
01:13:26,390 --> 01:13:27,950
You're not Kira, are you?

1591
01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:28,730
What the fuck?

1592
01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:29,830
No, I'm not.

1593
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:31,090
Hence.

1594
01:13:32,710 --> 01:13:35,770
Okay, trying to see if anybody has their notebook out.

1595
01:13:37,010 --> 01:13:40,770
See, I was also next to Juniper, so...

1596
01:13:40,770 --> 01:13:43,490
So, if my ID is gone, I know.

1597
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:44,730
What?

1598
01:13:44,990 --> 01:13:45,230
What?

1599
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:48,790
Your ID was stolen anyway, so it doesn't matter if I'm here.

1600
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:49,930
It doesn't matter.

1601
01:13:50,230 --> 01:13:50,730
I'm gonna...

1602
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:51,210
Oh!

1603
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:52,850
Oh my God!

1604
01:13:53,370 --> 01:13:55,370
I gotta investigate this guy.

1605
01:13:58,010 --> 01:13:59,310
Wow, two people?

1606
01:13:59,410 --> 01:13:59,670
Really?

1607
01:13:59,770 --> 01:14:00,970
Who is that two people?

1608
01:14:01,610 --> 01:14:02,630
Okay, Amelie.

1609
01:14:04,210 --> 01:14:05,230
Where is she?

1610
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:06,350
Amelie!

1611
01:14:07,070 --> 01:14:07,670
Amelie!

1612
01:14:08,570 --> 01:14:10,730
Amelie, I need to touch you for a sec.

1613
01:14:11,730 --> 01:14:13,190
Amelie, get back here!

1614
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:16,170
Wait, what?

1615
01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:20,390
How am I missing?

1616
01:14:20,550 --> 01:14:21,550
Okay, there you go.

1617
01:14:21,810 --> 01:14:24,290
Once the world accepts the way, Kira thinks someone...

1618
01:14:24,290 --> 01:14:26,030
These are not even investigations!

1619
01:14:27,290 --> 01:14:29,290
Oh my God, where the fuck is...

1620
01:14:29,290 --> 01:14:30,770
Where is Amelie?

1621
01:14:32,590 --> 01:14:33,010
Amelie!

1622
01:14:34,790 --> 01:14:36,730
I need to touch Amelie!

1623
01:14:38,970 --> 01:14:40,290
Amelie, I need to touch you!

1624
01:14:41,550 --> 01:14:41,770
Okay.

1625
01:14:42,450 --> 01:14:43,050
Alright, nice.

1626
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:44,030
I investigated you.

1627
01:14:44,190 --> 01:14:45,770
If I lose my ID, I swear to God.

1628
01:14:46,210 --> 01:14:47,690
My ID is gone after I touched you.

1629
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:48,430
I swear to God.

1630
01:14:50,710 --> 01:14:51,070
Okay.

1631
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:52,690
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

1632
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:53,450
Yeah, yeah, okay.

1633
01:14:54,210 --> 01:14:55,530
You're gonna steal my ID right now?

1634
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:57,150
Are you gonna identity theft me?

1635
01:14:57,650 --> 01:15:00,250
Are you gonna touch me and then take my identity?

1636
01:15:00,650 --> 01:15:02,090
It's not a joke, you know that, right?

1637
01:15:06,830 --> 01:15:08,670
I think there's something wrong with Kira.

1638
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:10,310
He's not been doing anything.

1639
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:14,670
What's he nervous about?

1640
01:15:14,770 --> 01:15:15,590
Just write something.

1641
01:15:15,810 --> 01:15:16,430
Do it, Amelie!

1642
01:15:16,530 --> 01:15:17,730
Write in your book right now!

1643
01:15:17,790 --> 01:15:18,230
In front of me.

1644
01:15:18,230 --> 01:15:19,090
I won't say anything.

1645
01:15:19,970 --> 01:15:20,590
Wait, what?

1646
01:15:20,910 --> 01:15:22,010
Yenna won't say anything too.

1647
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:27,590
You're already a fine shinigami?

1648
01:15:28,810 --> 01:15:30,010
Wait, what?

1649
01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:35,750
What happened?

1650
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:37,650
Oh my God.

1651
01:15:39,890 --> 01:15:41,070
She just walked away.

1652
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:42,330
She went to heaven!

1653
01:15:48,230 --> 01:15:50,230
Oh my God.

1654
01:15:52,450 --> 01:15:52,670
Okay.

1655
01:15:54,010 --> 01:15:54,970
That's not heaven.

1656
01:15:57,910 --> 01:15:59,830
That's what I call heaven.

1657
01:16:00,410 --> 01:16:02,930
That was absolutely not heaven.

1658
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:07,890
That's my bad.

1659
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:10,370
That's the bonus cutscene.

1660
01:16:10,550 --> 01:16:12,170
That reveal left us hanging.

1661
01:16:12,190 --> 01:16:12,770
Oh my God.

1662
01:16:13,890 --> 01:16:14,950
Oh my God.

1663
01:16:17,010 --> 01:16:19,530
I like how they didn't even kill the criminals.

1664
01:16:19,790 --> 01:16:21,110
They killed us instead.

1665
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:25,650
Okay.

1666
01:16:26,150 --> 01:16:27,670
Do you get a new ID every round?

1667
01:16:27,910 --> 01:16:30,190
Or once your video ID is gone, you're just in danger of getting murdered?

1668
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:31,510
I think it's just gone, gone.

1669
01:16:32,210 --> 01:16:32,650
Yeah, I think.

1670
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:34,410
That's a good question.

1671
01:16:35,870 --> 01:16:36,950
If you only have one?

1672
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:40,350
Anyway...

1673
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:41,570
Did anybody get theirs re-stolen?

1674
01:16:42,150 --> 01:16:42,670
Oh my God.

1675
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:44,330
No, I didn't want to press the button!

1676
01:16:44,330 --> 01:16:48,270
I think you can get your IDs back if we vote somebody out that might have your ID.

1677
01:16:48,410 --> 01:16:49,190
We can get it back.

1678
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:51,270
Yeah, yeah.

1679
01:16:51,430 --> 01:16:53,250
We should need to call somebody out.

1680
01:16:53,410 --> 01:16:54,910
Wait, I have a dying message.

1681
01:16:54,990 --> 01:16:55,710
Where do I find it?

1682
01:16:55,950 --> 01:16:57,690
Oh, maybe in your investigation notepad?

1683
01:16:59,110 --> 01:16:59,450
Oh.

1684
01:16:59,870 --> 01:17:01,650
You need to call somebody out, Doki.

1685
01:17:02,030 --> 01:17:04,590
That sounds like a thing Kira would want us to do.

1686
01:17:05,570 --> 01:17:09,130
I found Groomy's investigation notepad, but it doesn't tell me anything.

1687
01:17:09,430 --> 01:17:11,090
Oh, I guess she wasn't doing her job.

1688
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:15,630
It takes longer to do the voting if we do actually find stuff like that, because it's about to end and we haven't even...

1689
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:16,630
Okay, yeah, we gotta get...

1690
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:19,450
It didn't even give me a dying message.

1691
01:17:19,450 --> 01:17:20,090
Okay, I'm voting, I'm voting!

1692
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:23,430
It was random, it was not targeted, I swear.

1693
01:17:24,450 --> 01:17:27,590
It was not targeted, I just clicked the closest thing.

1694
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:29,810
Hopefully, we're gaming.

1695
01:17:30,490 --> 01:17:30,790
Okay.

1696
01:17:32,650 --> 01:17:33,090
Okay.

1697
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:35,470
I'm a little worried here.

1698
01:17:36,370 --> 01:17:37,310
I'm a little worried.

1699
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:41,090
Okay, who do I... Okay, question Vienna.

1700
01:17:42,530 --> 01:17:43,650
An NPC.

1701
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:44,790
Vienna!

1702
01:17:45,090 --> 01:17:46,110
Vienna, get back here!

1703
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:47,390
Vienna!

1704
01:17:48,970 --> 01:17:51,050
Don't run away from me, I swear to God!

1705
01:17:51,310 --> 01:17:52,150
It's not weird!

1706
01:17:53,850 --> 01:17:54,110
Oh.

1707
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:56,350
Okay, her notebook.

1708
01:17:56,470 --> 01:17:57,350
Who does she see?

1709
01:17:58,650 --> 01:17:59,210
LDKoi?

1710
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:12,120
Oh, no one opens a notebook?

1711
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:18,110
What does that mean?

1712
01:18:19,390 --> 01:18:20,230
Vienna, I need to investigate.

1713
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:21,210
I need to investigate you.

1714
01:18:21,310 --> 01:18:22,210
I need to investigate...

1715
01:18:22,210 --> 01:18:23,690
I need to investigate you first.

1716
01:18:26,710 --> 01:18:27,230
Okay.

1717
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:32,890
I have... I have Mint's notebook, but...

1718
01:18:33,450 --> 01:18:34,630
How do I find out?

1719
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:35,850
Oh, there it is.

1720
01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:36,910
Okay.

1721
01:18:37,570 --> 01:18:38,830
She was sus of me.

1722
01:18:38,910 --> 01:18:40,810
She was only sus of me?!

1723
01:18:43,990 --> 01:18:49,490
I found her body, and the only thing she had in her fucking notebook was that she sus of me.

1724
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:50,310
That's it.

1725
01:18:50,590 --> 01:18:52,730
Okay, Mint, we're never gonna...

1726
01:18:53,630 --> 01:18:56,090
We're never gonna fucking get him.

1727
01:18:57,850 --> 01:18:59,770
God really is on my side.

1728
01:18:59,890 --> 01:19:00,450
Wait, what's this?

1729
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:00,990
Oh!

1730
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:03,530
Oh, that was close.

1731
01:19:04,210 --> 01:19:05,370
I almost got isekai'd.

1732
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:10,890
Okay.

1733
01:19:11,970 --> 01:19:12,370
Okay.

1734
01:19:16,170 --> 01:19:17,770
Oh, hey guys, a lot of...

1735
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:21,270
I'm gonna make sure that...

1736
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:22,350
I'm making sure...

1737
01:19:22,350 --> 01:19:23,870
Oh, Juniper, what are you trying to do?

1738
01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:25,010
Are you trying to steal IDs, Juniper?

1739
01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:26,390
Are you trying to...

1740
01:19:27,550 --> 01:19:30,210
I'm trying to make sure, you know, people don't...

1741
01:19:30,210 --> 01:19:32,230
You know, I'm making sure I'm guiding...

1742
01:19:32,230 --> 01:19:32,570
Wait!

1743
01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:38,070
Wait, how did he just...

1744
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:39,210
How did he just die?!

1745
01:19:39,210 --> 01:19:39,630
Guys!

1746
01:19:39,630 --> 01:19:41,770
Lime just died in front of...

1747
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:43,090
I didn't even see!

1748
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:44,310
Guys!

1749
01:19:49,010 --> 01:19:50,870
I just died in front of...

1750
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:52,870
Dominate and Lime just died in front of...

1751
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:53,230
Guys!

1752
01:19:55,070 --> 01:19:56,250
Snuffy, where were you, Snuffy?

1753
01:19:56,370 --> 01:19:57,370
Snuffy, where were you?

1754
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:00,070
Snuffy, where were you?

1755
01:20:00,910 --> 01:20:02,270
I just disappeared.

1756
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:03,330
Snuffy, where were you?

1757
01:20:03,390 --> 01:20:03,990
Two people died.

1758
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:04,450
Where were you?

1759
01:20:04,530 --> 01:20:05,670
Nobody was right...

1760
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:06,710
Two people died.

1761
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:07,230
Where were you?

1762
01:20:08,030 --> 01:20:09,250
Where were you at, huh?

1763
01:20:10,870 --> 01:20:11,990
Stop approaching me!

1764
01:20:12,010 --> 01:20:12,550
Oh, shit!

1765
01:20:12,710 --> 01:20:13,970
Snuffy, why did you take the...

1766
01:20:13,970 --> 01:20:14,490
Notebook!

1767
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:15,850
I accidentally threw the notebook out!

1768
01:20:16,290 --> 01:20:17,870
Snuffy, read the notebook, Snuffy.

1769
01:20:17,990 --> 01:20:18,490
Read the notebook.

1770
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:22,050
I think you're...

1771
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:22,710
It's an attack!

1772
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:23,350
Oh, okay.

1773
01:20:23,510 --> 01:20:24,250
I think...

1774
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:25,570
Oh, no.

1775
01:20:26,470 --> 01:20:27,430
Oh, no.

1776
01:20:27,530 --> 01:20:28,730
I think it's Snuffy.

1777
01:20:29,150 --> 01:20:30,730
I think it's Snuffy.

1778
01:20:30,850 --> 01:20:31,770
There's no way.

1779
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:33,250
There's no way.

1780
01:20:33,470 --> 01:20:35,130
There's so little people left.

1781
01:20:38,850 --> 01:20:40,370
Guys, where's L?

1782
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:41,770
Where's L?

1783
01:20:42,110 --> 01:20:43,910
I think it's Snuffy and Juniper.

1784
01:20:47,710 --> 01:20:49,670
Yeah, I think it's Snuffy or...

1785
01:20:50,910 --> 01:20:51,510
Wait.

1786
01:20:55,210 --> 01:20:56,870
I think it's...

1787
01:20:56,870 --> 01:20:58,690
I think it's Snuffy or Juniper.

1788
01:20:59,410 --> 01:21:01,930
Okay, let me write this down in my trusty notebook.

1789
01:21:02,130 --> 01:21:02,750
I can't believe it.

1790
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:04,930
They just died in front of me and nobody cared.

1791
01:21:07,850 --> 01:21:08,890
They just...

1792
01:21:08,890 --> 01:21:11,230
L assigned a joint investigation?

1793
01:21:13,610 --> 01:21:15,830
Okay, I think it has to be...

1794
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:18,310
Okay.

1795
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:20,310
It has to be these two.

1796
01:21:20,910 --> 01:21:21,450
How do we...

1797
01:21:21,450 --> 01:21:22,530
How do we set up a meeting?

1798
01:21:23,270 --> 01:21:23,630
L!

1799
01:21:24,050 --> 01:21:26,710
Whoever you are, set up a meeting, L!

1800
01:21:27,690 --> 01:21:29,490
I know who it is!

1801
01:21:29,490 --> 01:21:29,670
It's...

1802
01:21:31,950 --> 01:21:33,130
It's not me!

1803
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:36,010
What are you guys doing?

1804
01:21:36,190 --> 01:21:37,110
What are you guys just...

1805
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:38,250
Are you guys talking to each other?

1806
01:21:38,970 --> 01:21:40,830
We're just, you know...

1807
01:21:41,390 --> 01:21:42,230
Hanging out.

1808
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:44,990
Oh, I can finally hear voices.

1809
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:47,430
I'll post your names on the internet.

1810
01:21:47,730 --> 01:21:48,370
Oh no!

1811
01:21:52,990 --> 01:21:54,250
That's how Lime died!

1812
01:21:58,250 --> 01:21:58,930
Wait!

1813
01:22:01,570 --> 01:22:02,790
Oh no!

1814
01:22:03,570 --> 01:22:03,890
No.

1815
01:22:04,730 --> 01:22:05,530
They're gonna dox.

1816
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,180
I have no idea what's going on.

1817
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:15,540
Yeah, that's what Akira would say.

1818
01:22:16,660 --> 01:22:19,100
That's what Akira would say right there.

1819
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:20,820
It looks suspicious, but it's not!

1820
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:22,660
The game's fucked up!

1821
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:27,880
I think...

1822
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:29,500
I think it's Snuffy.

1823
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,460
I think it's Snuffy also.

1824
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:31,920
Lime!

1825
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:32,600
I'm sorry, Snuffy.

1826
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,400
Lime and...

1827
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:37,480
I have no idea what's even going on, so I can't even say, like...

1828
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:39,100
Guys, I'm doing my investigation!

1829
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,040
Oh my god, all the criminals are dead!

1830
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,420
We've been helping with the tasks, but I'm sorry I can't, like...

1831
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:50,180
Oh!

1832
01:22:50,860 --> 01:22:52,620
Okay, that's not good.

1833
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,120
It's not good.

1834
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:55,840
We got...

1835
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:56,760
Come on, investigators!

1836
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:58,740
We're just almost there!

1837
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:03,900
Snuffy was alone.

1838
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:05,120
Oh, my ID was stolen?

1839
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:06,340
I know who was next to me.

1840
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:10,780
I know, like...

1841
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:13,300
Vienna and Jupi were next to me a lot.

1842
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:19,520
No, but then I...

1843
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:21,900
I stood next to a lot of people after that.

1844
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:23,440
And then I stood next to...

1845
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:25,860
Vienna, and I stood next to a lot...

1846
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:26,680
I'm gonna vote Snuffy.

1847
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:32,180
How am I making calculated moves?

1848
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:36,500
Wait, maybe it's...

1849
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:38,580
Maybe it's Juniper, because, like...

1850
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:39,900
She's...

1851
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:42,020
Did Doki help with the investigations?

1852
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:42,880
The two that we did?

1853
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:43,700
Yeah, I did.

1854
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:46,420
I did, and then I saw Lime...

1855
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:47,280
Because I don't know.

1856
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:48,360
I saw, and then I was...

1857
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:50,460
I was gonna do one, and I saw Lime, and...

1858
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:53,320
Amelie just fucking...

1859
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:53,920
Collapsed.

1860
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:55,440
Guys, we need...

1861
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:55,980
Oh, my God.

1862
01:23:55,980 --> 01:23:56,880
Guys, I'm...

1863
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:57,900
It's over.

1864
01:23:58,940 --> 01:23:59,540
It's...

1865
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:00,720
It's over.

1866
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:01,540
It's...

1867
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:02,180
We need...

1868
01:24:02,180 --> 01:24:03,560
We literally...

1869
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:05,600
We literally...

1870
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:05,940
No!

1871
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:12,100
Doki!

1872
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:13,740
You deserve that.

1873
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:14,460
No...

1874
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:16,180
You honestly deserve that.

1875
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:17,820
Oh, my God.

1876
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:18,320
No!

1877
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:21,880
My heart is...

1878
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:22,740
Can you call...

1879
01:24:22,740 --> 01:24:24,900
Can you call meetings in this, I wonder?

1880
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:26,180
I think L can.

1881
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:28,900
Oh, my God.

1882
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:30,200
Oh, my God.

1883
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:31,340
Oh, L can...

1884
01:24:31,340 --> 01:24:31,560
Oh, my God.

1885
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:32,200
Who killed you?

1886
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:33,180
Who killed you guys?

1887
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:35,580
What are you talking about?

1888
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:36,420
It's Snuffy.

1889
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:37,400
I knew...

1890
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:37,860
I told...

1891
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:38,520
I fucking...

1892
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:39,060
I knew it.

1893
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:39,960
I fucking...

1894
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:41,280
I was like, it has to be Snuffy.

1895
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:42,400
It has to be Snuffy.

1896
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,000
The camera's right there.

1897
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:45,200
Oh, my God.

1898
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:47,100
Wait, who is...

1899
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:49,140
Juniper is L, and there's a...

1900
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:51,700
Snuffy is like killing people right in front of the camera.

1901
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:54,160
Nobody believed me.

1902
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:55,280
I fucking knew it.

1903
01:24:57,820 --> 01:24:59,840
I'm gonna fucking pee in anger.

1904
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:00,620
I'll be right back.

1905
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:04,680
Oh, wait.

1906
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:07,740
They just revealed Vienna's role, so now everybody will know that it's Snuffy.

1907
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:12,520
I don't think they know that those people are dead, though.

1908
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:13,260
Yeah.

1909
01:25:14,140 --> 01:25:16,240
They don't see it until the end of the round.

1910
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:17,120
Oh, true.

1911
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:21,600
I think...

1912
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:22,200
Oh, no.

1913
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:23,580
This is so bad.

1914
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:27,460
They're not gonna make it.

1915
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:27,480
Oh, okay.

1916
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:28,440
I think Bao is back.

1917
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:28,800
Yippee!

1918
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:30,900
Oh, my gosh.

1919
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:32,020
Stay away.

1920
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:32,980
Stay away.

1921
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:35,340
All she needs is your ID.

1922
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:40,320
I actually wonder if, balance-wise, it's better to have shorter rounds...

1923
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:43,680
Because it feels like it's way too easy to steal everybody's fucking IDs at this point.

1924
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:45,440
Yeah, yeah.

1925
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:49,900
It's stressing me out.

1926
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:52,340
I wish I could move around as a ghost.

1927
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:53,420
I know.

1928
01:25:53,540 --> 01:25:55,880
You can watch the people, but you can't move.

1929
01:25:56,620 --> 01:25:58,480
You have to, like, pick one to spectate.

1930
01:25:58,860 --> 01:26:01,400
You open your little investigator list and click on somebody.

1931
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:03,580
It's literally, like...

1932
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:06,000
Wait, it's like...

1933
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,640
They have to just figure out...

1934
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:08,860
Is it just one...

1935
01:26:09,820 --> 01:26:14,060
One Kira, and then it's Vienna and Juniper against Snuffy?

1936
01:26:14,660 --> 01:26:17,060
Yeah, there's no Kira helper, for some reason.

1937
01:26:17,580 --> 01:26:18,960
Oh, I guess it's, like, random.

1938
01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:24,220
Are you serious?

1939
01:26:24,660 --> 01:26:26,100
Are you fucking...

1940
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:26,740
Oh my god!

1941
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:28,380
Can you get hit by the car?

1942
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:29,680
What just happened?

1943
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:33,080
Can you imagine after all that, Kira gets hit by a fucking car?

1944
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:38,060
I fucking knew it was you.

1945
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:38,640
Oh my god.

1946
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:39,260
There she is!

1947
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:39,840
Oh my god.

1948
01:26:40,180 --> 01:26:41,880
Oh no, she's making her move!

1949
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:42,880
Oh my god.

1950
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:44,340
She's investigating.

1951
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:45,660
What?

1952
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:46,640
Juniper just gave Snuffy...

1953
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:47,380
She's stealing IDs.

1954
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:48,580
She's stealing IDs.

1955
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:50,260
So bad.

1956
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
It's not me.

1957
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:55,120
It's not me.

1958
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:56,420
It's not me.

1959
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:57,940
It's not me.

1960
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:03,820
Wait, so the further the days go, do, like, more events happen?

1961
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:04,500
That's kind of fun.

1962
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,900
Yeah, they start saying different things, like the witnesses.

1963
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:10,340
Yeah.

1964
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:16,700
Please, please just...

1965
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:18,320
L, call a meeting, L!

1966
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:19,060
Just call a meeting!

1967
01:27:19,060 --> 01:27:20,360
I don't call a meeting!

1968
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:22,720
You know that there's only three of you left!

1969
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:24,220
Who's L?

1970
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:26,040
Juniper.

1971
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:27,180
Juniper.

1972
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,320
We're just letting Snuffy do whatever she wants!

1973
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:32,140
She caught me!

1974
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:34,800
She knew I was out there and she took my life!

1975
01:27:36,580 --> 01:27:38,460
Do you have trouble getting back in?

1976
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:39,740
Like, the invites aren't working?

1977
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:41,260
Yeah, I can invite her.

1978
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:43,460
I think we have to be in the lobby again.

1979
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:44,200
Yeah.

1980
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:44,720
Yeah.

1981
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:45,380
Oh, maybe.

1982
01:27:45,580 --> 01:27:45,960
Yeah, okay.

1983
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:47,460
I fucking knew it.

1984
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,660
I knew she wasn't... I knew she wasn't real.

1985
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,980
How does she keep getting L, though?

1986
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:54,200
Alright, Kira, I mean...

1987
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:55,020
I think... I don't know.

1988
01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:56,500
I think there's just something about it.

1989
01:27:58,320 --> 01:27:59,540
Stupid L costume.

1990
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:03,520
There's something about it.

1991
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:03,820
I like it, though.

1992
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:06,480
I'll post your names on the Internet!

1993
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:07,120
It's on the Internet!

1994
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:09,640
Oh my God, it's you!

1995
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:11,920
Damn, look at him.

1996
01:28:12,380 --> 01:28:13,220
That's me.

1997
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,340
With your sword!

1998
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:17,340
No!

1999
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:19,840
Juniper, I swear to God.

2000
01:28:20,220 --> 01:28:20,760
That was Doki!

2001
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:21,720
Oh my God!

2002
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:22,460
Oh my God!

2003
01:28:23,140 --> 01:28:24,360
We still have a dad!

2004
01:28:24,620 --> 01:28:27,560
One of us is L, one of us is Kira, and one of us is, like, John Adam.

2005
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:28,220
It's Snoopy!

2006
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:29,820
I swear it's Snoopy!

2007
01:28:30,260 --> 01:28:35,420
You guys saw that Vienna is... Vienna is an investigator and it's Snoopy!

2008
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:37,420
It's like...

2009
01:28:37,420 --> 01:28:41,980
I signed you two to work together because all three of us were in a room together!

2010
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:45,000
And I was like, this is how I can prove to them that I'm safe!

2011
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:46,400
It's Snoopy!

2012
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:51,460
We did it!

2013
01:28:52,380 --> 01:28:53,400
We did it!

2014
01:28:53,660 --> 01:29:00,500
If you just couldn't pick them, then if you tried to assign an investigation to somebody like that, it would just be like, sorry, that guy's evil, you can't pick them.

2015
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:02,840
He's yapping.

2016
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:04,540
Oh my God.

2017
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:08,500
Snoopy, you are talking so good right now, but I...

2018
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:09,180
It is you.

2019
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:10,200
It is you.

2020
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:12,180
I can't say anything because I can't hear anybody.

2021
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:15,000
You are talking so fucking good!

2022
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:18,400
He's using the I can't hear anybody excuse.

2023
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,620
I can't hear anyone.

2024
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:29,920
Oh my God, here it is.

2025
01:29:30,220 --> 01:29:30,900
Here it is.

2026
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:32,960
Sweet justice, sweet justice.

2027
01:29:33,380 --> 01:29:35,620
I wish we could hear you during the round.

2028
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:37,440
You can't hear me either?

2029
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:39,140
I can't hear anybody and you can't hear me?

2030
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:40,760
You were, like, running at me.

2031
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:43,760
I was trying to tell Junie I had to investigate her.

2032
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:08,100
How did she win that?

2033
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:09,440
Oh my God.

2034
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:12,840
I'm a genius, that's how.

2035
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:15,840
Why did you kill us?

2036
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:16,860
I'm so confused.

2037
01:30:19,340 --> 01:30:24,620
I can't, there's a maximum number of people you can kill every day, so I just tried to write everybody's names down.

2038
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:27,380
You can't kill any people until the next day.

2039
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:33,040
So it was basically, like, me blindly picking because I had nobody to give me, like, IDs or tell me anything.

2040
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:34,760
That's so sad.

2041
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,260
Let's be random then.

2042
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:38,700
Okay.

2043
01:30:42,420 --> 01:30:44,440
That's weird that you couldn't hear anybody.

2044
01:30:48,260 --> 01:30:50,040
Yeah, yeah, I just sent an invite to her.

2045
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:50,940
I just sent it.

2046
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:53,800
That's so weird that you couldn't hear anybody because we could hear you.

2047
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:56,560
Oh!

2048
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:58,480
Okay, I'll restart.

2049
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:00,340
Restart, restart.

2050
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:04,460
How do I restart the lobby?

2051
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:06,800
How do I get out of here?

2052
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:08,900
Oh, there it is.

2053
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:09,180
Yeah.

2054
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:12,500
Alright, create room.

2055
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:14,500
Let's see.

2056
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:15,380
Role selection off.

2057
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:17,040
Voice chat on.

2058
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:17,900
Create room.

2059
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:21,500
Okay, now I need to add people in.

2060
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:28,200
I hope that Guess Game gets more updates and, like, more stuff is added to it.

2061
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:34,240
Because, like, I can only put on one person as an ally, but it said you can do five.

2062
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:36,820
So I was like, how do you get five people as an ally?

2063
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:38,280
Hello!

2064
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:42,800
I'm trying to figure out how to get five people in, like, as a cure ally.

2065
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:44,380
Because it only said one for me.

2066
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:47,460
It's like one or zero and I'm like, what?

2067
01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:51,240
Okay, Juniper.

2068
01:31:52,580 --> 01:31:54,180
I don't know if I got everybody.

2069
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:01,720
Who was that?

2070
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:03,060
Who was that?

2071
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:04,660
Oh, my bad.

2072
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:05,300
My bad.

2073
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:06,660
What?

2074
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:10,180
Did it happen again?

2075
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:13,000
Yeah, you're on the webcam again.

2076
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:19,340
No, ten players is the max, guys.

2077
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:20,460
That's the thing.

2078
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:21,420
Ten players is max.

2079
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:23,040
You're better.

2080
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:23,440
That's good.

2081
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:24,560
Two, four, six.

2082
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:27,340
Yeah, we can hear you.

2083
01:32:28,060 --> 01:32:30,360
Okay, I'm genuinely wondering...

2084
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:33,800
If you get cured and you can't hear people, it seems almost like it's intentional.

2085
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:37,340
Because I can start hearing people almost immediately as voting starts, but I don't know why.

2086
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:38,280
Oh, maybe.

2087
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,500
No, no, no, no, because I was cured.

2088
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:45,140
That would be stupid, because, like, then it's really obvious.

2089
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:47,260
You just woke up to someone and you're like, hey, can you hear me?

2090
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:48,600
And if you can respond, it's them.

2091
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:51,340
Yeah, like, who's playing completely dumb here?

2092
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:58,300
Snoopy, I think it might have picked your VR headset as a device or something.

2093
01:32:58,420 --> 01:32:59,660
You sound like you're in an empty room now.

2094
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:01,160
Maybe it changed.

2095
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:02,260
Maybe it changed, though.

2096
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:05,880
I don't know why it says, like, maximum is one.

2097
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:09,160
Because the literally trailer was like, you can get up to five followers.

2098
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:10,100
I'm like, what?

2099
01:33:10,820 --> 01:33:12,960
You can apparently only have one follower for Kira.

2100
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:14,720
Is that a one or a zero?

2101
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:17,040
Let's see.

2102
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:22,860
It's like 5v5.

2103
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:26,020
It's like a... Okay, let's see.

2104
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:27,720
Oh, I get the voting time.

2105
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:29,260
I'm doing meeting time longer, too.

2106
01:33:29,260 --> 01:33:31,520
I know you would tell me if I sounded like shit.

2107
01:33:31,580 --> 01:33:33,120
What if I make us super fast?

2108
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:39,340
I'm gonna make us super fast.

2109
01:33:47,140 --> 01:33:48,780
Yeah, because I put random.

2110
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:52,260
I put random and it, like, makes it so that...

2111
01:33:59,260 --> 01:34:03,420
You sat in front of a camera writing, like, four names in your fucking notebook.

2112
01:34:03,580 --> 01:34:03,580
I know!

2113
01:34:03,580 --> 01:34:04,420
I didn't know what I was doing.

2114
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:07,780
I was like, this game must be like, you know, I don't have a follower.

2115
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:09,400
So I was like, kind of like...

2116
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:11,940
You're just like, time to write everybody in.

2117
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:15,820
I know, I just started writing down names like, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

2118
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:18,580
Who am I missing, guys?

2119
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:19,300
Who am I missing?

2120
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:21,960
Who's missing?

2121
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:23,000
Who's missing?

2122
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:23,140
Who's missing?

2123
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:30,740
Oh guys, it would be very awkward on the person that...

2124
01:34:30,740 --> 01:34:32,160
No, no, Trinaferce here.

2125
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:33,120
Oh, Amelie!

2126
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:33,640
Amelie!

2127
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:34,240
Amelie!

2128
01:34:34,340 --> 01:34:35,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2129
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:36,240
She has like, the weird name.

2130
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:37,680
Have Mercy.

2131
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:41,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2132
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:45,100
No, I just forgot she changed your name to the Have Mercy one.

2133
01:34:46,460 --> 01:34:48,020
Okay, oh yeah, I'll add more tasks, too.

2134
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:49,280
Okay, how do I...

2135
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:49,600
Alright.

2136
01:34:50,220 --> 01:34:50,740
For which one?

2137
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,140
For Elle and Kira, right?

2138
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:54,700
I think...

2139
01:34:54,700 --> 01:34:56,720
Yeah, just more things to do, I think.

2140
01:34:56,860 --> 01:34:57,820
Yeah, I'll add more.

2141
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:58,820
I don't know if we wanna...

2142
01:34:58,820 --> 01:35:07,420
I don't know if it's worth reducing the amount of time in a day because it feels like most of the IDs can get stolen in one round, but I don't know.

2143
01:35:07,540 --> 01:35:11,180
Alright, I'll make it less than... I'll do 60 seconds instead of 90.

2144
01:35:12,220 --> 01:35:12,500
Okay.

2145
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:13,500
Yeah, and then we'll see.

2146
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:14,620
I made us super fast.

2147
01:35:14,740 --> 01:35:15,520
Oh, actually, no, I shouldn't.

2148
01:35:15,620 --> 01:35:17,580
Maybe I'll make us not super fast.

2149
01:35:20,020 --> 01:35:21,580
More time to talk, for sure.

2150
01:35:22,540 --> 01:35:23,140
Let's see.

2151
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:24,180
Day, night, task.

2152
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:25,080
I put 4 tasks.

2153
01:35:25,180 --> 01:35:26,860
I'll do 4 tasks.

2154
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:29,320
And then...

2155
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:32,000
I think that's good, right?

2156
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:32,840
4 tasks.

2157
01:35:33,020 --> 01:35:33,660
Or should we have more?

2158
01:35:33,780 --> 01:35:34,600
2 was the default.

2159
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:36,740
4 should be fine.

2160
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:38,740
Alright, let's see what that's gonna be.

2161
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:40,140
Alright.

2162
01:35:42,660 --> 01:35:43,860
Alright, start game.

2163
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:54,320
Oh my gosh.

2164
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:55,160
Wait, I'm Kira.

2165
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:56,880
Oh my gosh, this is it.

2166
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:00,020
This is it.

2167
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:01,140
This is what we've been training for.

2168
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:05,120
This is exactly what we've been training for, guys.

2169
01:36:11,190 --> 01:36:12,030
Hey, guys.

2170
01:36:13,150 --> 01:36:13,630
Hey.

2171
01:36:20,590 --> 01:36:21,550
Where are you?

2172
01:36:22,130 --> 01:36:22,950
Are you okay?

2173
01:36:31,900 --> 01:36:32,380
Okay.

2174
01:36:35,660 --> 01:36:36,880
We'll never know.

2175
01:36:36,940 --> 01:36:37,360
Oh, wait.

2176
01:36:39,980 --> 01:36:42,040
I forgot I was proximity.

2177
01:36:45,180 --> 01:36:46,620
I forgot.

2178
01:36:47,260 --> 01:36:47,980
I forgot.

2179
01:36:48,860 --> 01:36:49,060
Wait.

2180
01:36:50,420 --> 01:36:51,540
Yeah, yeah.

2181
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:52,280
I can hear you.

2182
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:53,720
I can hear you.

2183
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:57,820
Vindicating evidence?

2184
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:58,680
What does that do?

2185
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:04,900
Judge collaborators and prevent role reviews?

2186
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:05,760
Oh.

2187
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:12,960
Whoops, I said out the thing.

2188
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,860
I said out the stuff.

2189
01:37:15,180 --> 01:37:21,520
I didn't realize that was my task.

2190
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:35,240
I didn't know.

2191
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:37,780
I didn't know, guys.

2192
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:39,240
Wait.

2193
01:37:42,340 --> 01:37:42,780
Wait.

2194
01:37:45,940 --> 01:37:47,200
Wait, who's on me?

2195
01:37:47,260 --> 01:37:48,760
There's four people around me.

2196
01:37:48,780 --> 01:37:50,120
Who's around me right now?

2197
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:55,480
Wait, what?

2198
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:56,700
We're finding Kira, yeah.

2199
01:37:58,140 --> 01:37:58,740
Wait, what?

2200
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:00,240
Wait, what?

2201
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:01,200
Wait, I'm confused.

2202
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:02,260
I'm confused.

2203
01:38:03,380 --> 01:38:07,940
Guys, I didn't know.

2204
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:10,060
I didn't know.

2205
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:11,800
Guys.

2206
01:38:29,860 --> 01:38:30,700
Oh.

2207
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:34,000
Oh, I'm trying to...

2208
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,460
I'm trying so hard to not fuck it up.

2209
01:38:37,780 --> 01:38:40,400
I'll assign a joint investigation.

2210
01:38:48,770 --> 01:38:49,470
Nice.

2211
01:38:52,690 --> 01:38:53,690
Oh my gosh.

2212
01:38:55,070 --> 01:38:56,690
Wait, what's going on?

2213
01:39:04,420 --> 01:39:05,480
Oh no.

2214
01:39:05,660 --> 01:39:08,360
Why is he so... How did someone get murdered already?

2215
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:11,300
Oh my God!

2216
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:14,440
Oh my God, she shot him!

2217
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:21,480
Holy shit!

2218
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:23,280
Guys!

2219
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:25,100
Guys, gotta be careful.

2220
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:26,720
You gotta put a safety on.

2221
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:31,020
Holy shit.

2222
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:33,920
That's so GG.

2223
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:39,700
But they were working with Minto.

2224
01:39:40,020 --> 01:39:41,100
It was the Nerf gun.

2225
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:43,160
I... I don't know what happened.

2226
01:39:44,540 --> 01:39:49,300
There was like 10 seconds left when we had this collaboration...

2227
01:39:49,300 --> 01:39:50,520
And I couldn't do anything.

2228
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:56,540
Okay, so is it not Snuffy then?

2229
01:39:56,620 --> 01:39:57,860
Oh wait, Snuffy's dead.

2230
01:39:58,860 --> 01:40:00,320
What do you mean?

2231
01:40:00,920 --> 01:40:02,740
She literally got death noted.

2232
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,260
We're like, so is it?

2233
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:05,100
Is it not?

2234
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:08,920
She can't be...

2235
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:10,240
Is it... Could it be Snuffy?

2236
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:12,760
Mine was stolen.

2237
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:15,600
But we were all investigating that body.

2238
01:40:16,940 --> 01:40:17,820
Yeah, yeah.

2239
01:40:21,580 --> 01:40:22,020
Yeah.

2240
01:40:26,940 --> 01:40:28,820
Wait, why do we know it's not you guys?

2241
01:40:34,540 --> 01:40:36,420
Yeah, because my idea was stolen.

2242
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:38,200
My idea was stolen when I was investigating.

2243
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:39,980
And I was by myself first.

2244
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:41,640
And then four people surrounded me.

2245
01:40:43,460 --> 01:40:46,220
So it was... I don't... I couldn't even see who the four was...

2246
01:40:46,220 --> 01:40:48,040
Because I was investigating that body first.

2247
01:40:48,780 --> 01:40:51,840
I know that I was in close contact with Grimmy a couple of times.

2248
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:57,520
The people that I've been near are Bao and Grimmy, I think.

2249
01:40:58,320 --> 01:40:58,760
And also...

2250
01:40:59,380 --> 01:41:01,000
Wait, whose ID got stolen again?

2251
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:03,640
My ID got stolen, because I was in that...

2252
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:06,100
That body thing on the top left.

2253
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:09,880
Okay, I was with Grimmy back during that.

2254
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,260
And someone else.

2255
01:41:12,260 --> 01:41:14,580
So maybe Bao pretended to want...

2256
01:41:14,580 --> 01:41:14,860
Juniper.

2257
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:16,000
...property.

2258
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:18,160
But I did give you stuff back, though.

2259
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:20,320
And I was giving a lost package back.

2260
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:22,860
It's not my ID, though.

2261
01:41:22,940 --> 01:41:24,400
I've still lost that, so...

2262
01:41:25,700 --> 01:41:26,880
I swear I gave it.

2263
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:28,520
Yeah, why did you give back her ID?

2264
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:33,460
I don't think it's actually lost packages or not IDs.

2265
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:36,680
It said... It said deliver package.

2266
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:40,680
And I was trying to go around to deliver the one package back.

2267
01:41:41,490 --> 01:41:43,920
And I had the ID to give back, too.

2268
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:46,380
Toki, why are you investigator investigating?

2269
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:51,680
I'm just investigating.

2270
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:56,240
You can change your name tag.

2271
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:58,720
You can change your name tag in the customization.

2272
01:42:06,370 --> 01:42:09,910
Bao, where are you?

2273
01:42:11,490 --> 01:42:13,110
Bao, where are you?

2274
01:42:14,530 --> 01:42:15,050
Yes?

2275
01:42:16,030 --> 01:42:16,330
Follow me.

2276
01:42:16,430 --> 01:42:17,970
I need to give you the notebook.

2277
01:42:18,530 --> 01:42:19,050
Okay.

2278
01:42:22,170 --> 01:42:24,510
Why are you... Why are you following us, huh?

2279
01:42:24,810 --> 01:42:26,070
Why are you following us?

2280
01:42:29,390 --> 01:42:32,210
What is she... What is she talking about?

2281
01:42:32,590 --> 01:42:33,530
I don't know.

2282
01:42:33,730 --> 01:42:34,590
She's being weird.

2283
01:42:35,090 --> 01:42:36,190
She's being weird.

2284
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:39,330
She thinks we're... She's in on it with us.

2285
01:42:39,610 --> 01:42:41,750
Yeah, she thinks she's... She thinks she's...

2286
01:42:41,750 --> 01:42:44,370
Wait, we don't... We shouldn't... We shouldn't be here.

2287
01:42:44,490 --> 01:42:45,590
There's a surveillance camera.

2288
01:42:47,650 --> 01:42:50,130
I didn't give you... I didn't give you the book.

2289
01:42:50,250 --> 01:42:52,590
I can't be... I can't be... I'm in too deep.

2290
01:42:52,610 --> 01:42:53,590
I'm in too deep.

2291
01:42:54,170 --> 01:42:55,250
I'm in too deep.

2292
01:42:55,330 --> 01:42:56,470
We gotta find an area.

2293
01:42:57,050 --> 01:42:57,850
I'm in too deep.

2294
01:42:59,290 --> 01:42:59,710
Wait,

2295
01:43:04,410 --> 01:43:05,370
what do I do as a joint?

2296
01:43:15,610 --> 01:43:17,350
Okay, you're Kira now.

2297
01:43:21,750 --> 01:43:24,690
Wait, what do I do as a invest... As a joint investigation?

2298
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:34,400
Where's Amelie?

2299
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:38,080
Where's Amelie?

2300
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:40,960
We need to work together!

2301
01:43:43,180 --> 01:43:44,340
Amelie, let's work together!

2302
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:44,660
I'm here!

2303
01:43:44,780 --> 01:43:45,020
I'm here!

2304
01:43:45,020 --> 01:43:45,260
I'm here!

2305
01:43:45,340 --> 01:43:45,460
I'm here!

2306
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:45,580
I'm here!

2307
01:43:45,580 --> 01:43:46,340
I'm doing it!

2308
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:47,560
I'm doing it!

2309
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,240
Oh my god!

2310
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:03,260
Amelie died while I was trying to work together with her!

2311
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:07,560
Amelie died while I was trying to work together with her!

2312
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:12,240
No!

2313
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:25,500
She's in a better place now.

2314
01:44:28,340 --> 01:44:29,560
I know, yeah.

2315
01:44:30,860 --> 01:44:32,300
Kira looks so good.

2316
01:44:32,700 --> 01:44:37,800
Oh my god, I was doing a joint thing with Amelie and she just collapsed next to me.

2317
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:43,200
I was like, Amelie, what's going on?

2318
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:45,280
She stopped talking and then she just passed out.

2319
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:51,840
Oh my gosh.

2320
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:55,640
Come on, do your tasks, everybody.

2321
01:44:55,740 --> 01:44:56,240
There we go.

2322
01:44:56,680 --> 01:44:58,460
I mean, we're doing our tasks right now.

2323
01:44:58,460 --> 01:45:01,280
It's really hard to win by doing tasks.

2324
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:10,620
So that means three died, right?

2325
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:12,580
Because the last one was like, zero.

2326
01:45:20,990 --> 01:45:27,230
Well, I was with Amelie doing a joint investigation and then she collapsed.

2327
01:45:27,630 --> 01:45:28,370
Right next to you, huh?

2328
01:45:28,630 --> 01:45:30,890
Yeah, but it's not me.

2329
01:45:30,890 --> 01:45:33,370
I think there's a follower this round, too.

2330
01:45:33,550 --> 01:45:40,630
Because one of the little people that I investigated said that they saw someone passing off the notebook.

2331
01:45:41,930 --> 01:45:43,290
Like the little NPC.

2332
01:45:44,050 --> 01:45:45,810
Oh, wait, which side was it?

2333
01:45:46,270 --> 01:45:47,530
Do you remember?

2334
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:49,370
Because we can open the map with M.

2335
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:51,810
Was it in the beginning or the middle?

2336
01:45:52,310 --> 01:45:54,030
It was when it was daytime.

2337
01:45:55,190 --> 01:45:59,330
It was the one by the... It said in the classroom that they passed it off.

2338
01:46:00,890 --> 01:46:04,330
I think it's... I think it's maybe Bao or Juniper.

2339
01:46:04,830 --> 01:46:05,370
It is.

2340
01:46:06,410 --> 01:46:10,170
I mean, I can't really say anything to defend myself, but it's not me.

2341
01:46:10,430 --> 01:46:11,030
Puts hands up.

2342
01:46:11,810 --> 01:46:12,930
Puts hands up?

2343
01:46:13,450 --> 01:46:14,690
Puts hands up.

2344
01:46:14,690 --> 01:46:16,430
Wait, why do you think it's Bao or Juniper?

2345
01:46:17,410 --> 01:46:19,770
I get like really submissive.

2346
01:46:19,950 --> 01:46:22,470
I like lay on the ground, I roll over, I show my belly.

2347
01:46:23,370 --> 01:46:25,030
Okay, well, I'm gonna be on the floor.

2348
01:46:25,090 --> 01:46:27,590
That sounds like what a follower would say.

2349
01:46:28,490 --> 01:46:35,670
I think that's... I can't think of anything that involves me having to lie.

2350
01:46:35,890 --> 01:46:38,230
I pick investigator literally every time.

2351
01:46:38,770 --> 01:46:39,570
Let's go.

2352
01:46:41,370 --> 01:46:46,310
I got a dying message from Snuffy, but I don't really understand it.

2353
01:46:46,790 --> 01:46:49,090
So I think that was a confession, right?

2354
01:46:49,350 --> 01:46:50,890
Bao, like...

2355
01:46:51,690 --> 01:46:53,310
How is that a confession?

2356
01:46:53,310 --> 01:46:53,390
Confession!

2357
01:46:55,630 --> 01:47:00,250
You can read people's notebooks by... If you go into like the thing, it'll show you which ones they have marked off.

2358
01:47:00,350 --> 01:47:01,690
Oh god, there's 10 seconds, never mind.

2359
01:47:04,570 --> 01:47:05,170
It's Juniper!

2360
01:47:05,430 --> 01:47:05,830
It's Juniper!

2361
01:47:06,570 --> 01:47:07,210
It's Juniper!

2362
01:47:08,150 --> 01:47:08,770
It's Juniper!

2363
01:47:08,910 --> 01:47:09,070
It's Juniper!

2364
01:47:10,150 --> 01:47:10,930
I'm so sorry.

2365
01:47:11,350 --> 01:47:12,250
Wait, it's not Juniper.

2366
01:47:12,390 --> 01:47:13,690
Wait, it's not...

2367
01:47:13,690 --> 01:47:14,730
Yo, I'm chill.

2368
01:47:14,830 --> 01:47:15,450
Let me do it.

2369
01:47:18,710 --> 01:47:20,170
What does that mean?

2370
01:47:20,890 --> 01:47:21,630
Oh my gosh.

2371
01:47:22,350 --> 01:47:24,350
You're going downtown, Charlie Brown.

2372
01:47:25,070 --> 01:47:27,710
Yeah, you're going into Slammer.

2373
01:47:29,190 --> 01:47:32,730
Self-proclaimed standard investigator.

2374
01:47:41,020 --> 01:47:43,200
I can explain.

2375
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:46,940
Bao, you killed too many people.

2376
01:47:47,060 --> 01:47:47,900
The moment I gave...

2377
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:56,640
The moment I gave her the notebook, she killed everybody.

2378
01:47:58,700 --> 01:48:00,560
She never stopped.

2379
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:07,720
You're supposed to stagger the kills!

2380
01:48:14,300 --> 01:48:16,780
She went fucking wild.

2381
01:48:17,020 --> 01:48:17,760
She was like...

2382
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:26,000
I could've sworn that was the point of a book called The Death Note.

2383
01:48:28,780 --> 01:48:29,480
Oh my god.

2384
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:31,960
I could be my favorite character.

2385
01:48:32,660 --> 01:48:33,240
Me too.

2386
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:34,320
Oh, is it time?

2387
01:48:35,940 --> 01:48:38,260
Oh my god, we're all this ugliness.

2388
01:48:42,240 --> 01:48:43,180
New... Okay, wait.

2389
01:48:43,380 --> 01:48:44,100
New world.

2390
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:45,700
What the hell is this version of Kira?

2391
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:48,660
Why is there this version and this...

2392
01:48:50,500 --> 01:48:51,940
No, I'm Kira.

2393
01:48:52,140 --> 01:48:52,480
You're an investigator.

2394
01:48:52,940 --> 01:48:54,920
You're gonna be investigator, investigator.

2395
01:48:57,020 --> 01:49:00,620
I legitimately thought it was like only Kira's can like be...

2396
01:49:00,620 --> 01:49:01,920
I was like, wait a minute.

2397
01:49:02,060 --> 01:49:03,220
But I was like, oh no, I changed it.

2398
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:05,920
There's so many more new characters now.

2399
01:49:06,020 --> 01:49:06,620
It's so exciting.

2400
01:49:08,060 --> 01:49:08,600
Oh yeah.

2401
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:10,360
I don't remember this guy.

2402
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:11,720
Misa is so cute.

2403
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:12,300
That's Mellow.

2404
01:49:13,220 --> 01:49:13,900
That's Mellow.

2405
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:25,000
That's how they... That's how they get you.

2406
01:49:25,900 --> 01:49:27,440
That's how they get you right there.

2407
01:49:35,120 --> 01:49:36,840
Oh my god.

2408
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:40,820
Oh my god.

2409
01:49:43,940 --> 01:49:45,120
I don't look sus.

2410
01:49:45,320 --> 01:49:46,060
Are you guys ready?

2411
01:49:52,340 --> 01:49:52,740
Yeah,

2412
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:59,180
I read it out loud and I was like, oh my god.

2413
01:49:59,780 --> 01:50:01,440
And that's why I killed it off.

2414
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:06,400
I was like, nobody noticed except for Snuffy.

2415
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:07,340
So I was like, you're out.

2416
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:08,180
You're out of the game.

2417
01:50:14,660 --> 01:50:18,680
I was like, and that's why I made Snuffy shoot herself.

2418
01:50:23,740 --> 01:50:25,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2419
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:26,720
They become Kira.

2420
01:50:28,140 --> 01:50:28,300
Yes.

2421
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:32,580
So when I gave my notebook to Bao, she went fucking crazy.

2422
01:50:32,780 --> 01:50:33,920
She was like, it's time.

2423
01:50:43,900 --> 01:50:48,960
The collaboration things that happen with L aren't always the safe people.

2424
01:50:49,240 --> 01:50:49,700
No, no, no.

2425
01:50:49,740 --> 01:50:51,120
You don't know who's safe basically.

2426
01:50:52,100 --> 01:50:52,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2427
01:50:53,080 --> 01:50:56,800
Or putting two people together and seeing what happens maybe.

2428
01:50:56,920 --> 01:50:57,180
Okay.

2429
01:50:57,800 --> 01:50:58,300
Yeah, yeah.

2430
01:50:58,340 --> 01:51:01,960
You see like if they get together and the other person died.

2431
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:03,460
Alright, are you guys ready?

2432
01:51:04,420 --> 01:51:04,820
Yeah!

2433
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:07,200
Oh no!

2434
01:51:07,380 --> 01:51:08,420
Every single time!

2435
01:51:15,680 --> 01:51:18,400
I like how we're learning more and more about this game.

2436
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:19,360
The longer we play.

2437
01:51:23,560 --> 01:51:25,060
She's like, delete, delete, delete.

2438
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:27,300
I'm gonna write your name and your name.

2439
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:29,560
I'm not writing names by the way.

2440
01:51:29,620 --> 01:51:30,000
I'm not Kira.

2441
01:51:30,620 --> 01:51:33,660
I was just explaining something to my chat.

2442
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:34,960
I had proximity points.

2443
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:36,080
I'm not suspicious.

2444
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:38,120
I swear.

2445
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:39,080
I swear.

2446
01:51:39,180 --> 01:51:39,920
You wanna get near me?

2447
01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:41,080
You wanna get near me, Kira?

2448
01:51:42,220 --> 01:51:42,780
You know what?

2449
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:43,660
Yeah?

2450
01:51:44,740 --> 01:51:46,860
It'd be funny if I died right there.

2451
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:48,260
That'd be so funny.

2452
01:51:48,260 --> 01:51:49,500
Let me open my...

2453
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:52,520
Let me open my investigation thing right now.

2454
01:51:56,940 --> 01:51:57,420
Yeah?

2455
01:51:57,960 --> 01:51:58,760
Open your notebook right now.

2456
01:51:58,800 --> 01:51:59,260
Who's gonna...

2457
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:03,420
I won't even have time to... I won't even have time to tell people.

2458
01:52:03,660 --> 01:52:04,240
Open your notebook.

2459
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:08,180
Oh, okay.

2460
01:52:08,500 --> 01:52:09,260
Vindicating evidence.

2461
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:13,260
Okay, we gotta...

2462
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:14,660
It's this way.

2463
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:15,640
We gotta get out of here.

2464
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:17,280
Oh!

2465
01:52:17,660 --> 01:52:18,140
Oh!

2466
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:18,780
Okay.

2467
01:52:20,060 --> 01:52:21,160
Oh, so Grimmy's safe.

2468
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:25,800
So she's safe.

2469
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:28,280
Wait.

2470
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:32,420
Avoid contact with others and keep the paper safe.

2471
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:32,780
Okay.

2472
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:34,860
Don't get near me, guys.

2473
01:52:36,860 --> 01:52:39,500
I need to get... Oh my god, there's so many NPCs.

2474
01:52:39,700 --> 01:52:41,980
I need to talk to...

2475
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:45,820
Someone was talking on the receiver in the hotel.

2476
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:46,440
Okay.

2477
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:48,900
Wait, people were talking.

2478
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:51,460
A lot of people were talking.

2479
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:54,920
Oh my god, Grimmy got doxxed.

2480
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:56,660
Oh shit, okay.

2481
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:01,700
Wait, where is it?

2482
01:53:01,740 --> 01:53:02,440
Where's the dead body?

2483
01:53:04,020 --> 01:53:05,040
Is it over here?

2484
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:07,720
It's over here.

2485
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:09,400
Oh wait, but I need to talk to him first.

2486
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:10,680
This is more important.

2487
01:53:12,240 --> 01:53:13,200
Oh wait.

2488
01:53:13,480 --> 01:53:13,760
Wait.

2489
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:15,560
Okay.

2490
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:19,060
Oh, you're safe.

2491
01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:19,960
Okay, I got you.

2492
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:22,720
I got you, don't worry.

2493
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:24,240
I know you're safe.

2494
01:53:24,460 --> 01:53:26,160
If your ID is stolen, it's not me.

2495
01:53:26,160 --> 01:53:27,260
Thank you.

2496
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:29,540
Last round, my entire chat was going, don't suspect Oki.

2497
01:53:29,660 --> 01:53:31,860
She seems really chill in this round.

2498
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:34,440
I was awesome.

2499
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:41,300
Yeah, I mean, technically, I wasn't Kira.

2500
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:44,160
Technically, I wasn't.

2501
01:53:46,640 --> 01:53:49,960
Oh my god, how many people am I supposed to talk to?

2502
01:53:50,260 --> 01:53:54,460
Holy shit, why is there so... Why are there so many suspicious people?

2503
01:53:55,560 --> 01:53:56,740
Oh, Juniper!

2504
01:53:58,400 --> 01:53:59,700
What's on her notebook?

2505
01:54:03,740 --> 01:54:04,340
Nobody!

2506
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:07,340
Juniper, you gotta be taking notes.

2507
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:08,820
What kind of detective are you?

2508
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:10,220
Juniper died here, by the way.

2509
01:54:12,420 --> 01:54:14,140
May I judge you, please?

2510
01:54:17,700 --> 01:54:18,240
Okay.

2511
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:19,460
No!

2512
01:54:26,300 --> 01:54:26,540
Oh my god!

2513
01:54:26,840 --> 01:54:28,800
Oh my god!

2514
01:54:29,860 --> 01:54:30,320
Jesus!

2515
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:33,720
Holy shit!

2516
01:54:34,640 --> 01:54:35,640
Eyes wide open.

2517
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:37,840
No, she knew too much!

2518
01:54:40,420 --> 01:54:42,040
She looked up!

2519
01:54:42,660 --> 01:54:43,660
Who found her notebook?

2520
01:54:43,860 --> 01:54:46,360
I have her notebook, but she had nothing in it.

2521
01:54:46,440 --> 01:54:47,660
She was not doing her homework.

2522
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:51,120
And literally, I was like, I looked in it, and like, nothing.

2523
01:54:52,100 --> 01:54:53,880
I'll be honest, I don't ever do my homework.

2524
01:54:54,040 --> 01:54:54,960
Are you supposed to... Wait.

2525
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:56,080
You're supposed to put...

2526
01:54:56,940 --> 01:55:00,360
You're supposed to put notes on who you think is like, most suspicious.

2527
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:02,920
Yeah, yeah, so you click on them.

2528
01:55:03,620 --> 01:55:05,220
There's like, oh, this is the last person.

2529
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:20,640
I still have my ID.

2530
01:55:20,640 --> 01:55:20,720
ID.

2531
01:55:26,780 --> 01:55:29,060
Why do we think F is Kira?

2532
01:55:32,240 --> 01:55:34,780
Yeah, yeah, they can help.

2533
01:55:50,780 --> 01:55:55,700
On the bottom portion of the map, someone was seen at night...

2534
01:55:55,700 --> 01:55:58,660
Holding a notebook and opening it.

2535
01:56:00,740 --> 01:56:01,400
I...

2536
01:56:05,740 --> 01:56:09,080
Wait, is it longer?

2537
01:56:09,580 --> 01:56:11,060
I think so!

2538
01:56:11,300 --> 01:56:11,700
Wait, yeah.

2539
01:56:14,760 --> 01:56:17,460
Yeah, I think I actually made it longer now.

2540
01:56:18,540 --> 01:56:19,240
I think...

2541
01:56:21,540 --> 01:56:22,300
Uh-huh.

2542
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:25,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2543
01:56:25,860 --> 01:56:27,860
Also, so Vienna, why do you think it's Snuffy?

2544
01:56:31,320 --> 01:56:32,320
And now she's dead.

2545
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:40,640
She said it was Snuffy, because...

2546
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:42,400
Alright, you know what?

2547
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:42,980
Let's do it.

2548
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:43,760
Let's take a shot.

2549
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,180
Guys, let's take a shot.

2550
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:47,790
If we're wrong...

2551
01:56:48,710 --> 01:56:50,510
Yeah, that seems like a confession right there.

2552
01:56:50,590 --> 01:56:51,150
Let's do it.

2553
01:57:09,350 --> 01:57:09,710
Again?!

2554
01:57:19,170 --> 01:57:20,850
She literally...

2555
01:57:20,850 --> 01:57:28,550
Are you...

2556
01:57:28,550 --> 01:57:30,670
Do you have any IDs on you?

2557
01:57:31,690 --> 01:57:32,110
Oh!

2558
01:57:32,930 --> 01:57:34,810
Okay, so she wasn't Kira.

2559
01:57:36,670 --> 01:57:38,830
So she wasn't...

2560
01:57:45,120 --> 01:57:47,260
Let's see... I had to deliver something.

2561
01:57:47,900 --> 01:57:48,660
What did I deliver?

2562
01:57:48,780 --> 01:57:48,940
Oh.

2563
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:50,840
I have an item for you!

2564
01:57:51,900 --> 01:57:52,860
Wait, not that!

2565
01:57:53,480 --> 01:57:55,880
I gave you Juniper's notebook, Mint.

2566
01:57:58,940 --> 01:57:59,800
Mint, get over here!

2567
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:01,520
I have something for... Mint, get over here!

2568
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:03,020
I literally have a task for you!

2569
01:58:03,680 --> 01:58:04,680
Wait, actually, I don't.

2570
01:58:05,060 --> 01:58:05,300
JK.

2571
01:58:06,280 --> 01:58:07,820
I had to find the lost item.

2572
01:58:09,580 --> 01:58:12,720
It is weird that she's not talking back to me.

2573
01:58:13,220 --> 01:58:15,100
And that's pretty sus.

2574
01:58:17,680 --> 01:58:18,320
Hmm.

2575
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:21,800
Okay.

2576
01:58:27,610 --> 01:58:29,030
It's pretty weird.

2577
01:58:31,910 --> 01:58:33,310
Alright, there it is.

2578
01:58:33,470 --> 01:58:33,690
Okay.

2579
01:58:34,990 --> 01:58:39,990
Mint was next to me, so if my ID is gone, then...

2580
01:58:39,990 --> 01:58:41,370
Then we all know why.

2581
01:58:42,170 --> 01:58:43,730
Yeah, why Mint no talk?

2582
01:58:43,950 --> 01:58:44,290
Hmm?

2583
01:58:44,630 --> 01:58:46,130
Why she no talk to me?

2584
01:58:49,170 --> 01:58:51,350
Someone wrote during the day...

2585
01:58:51,350 --> 01:58:52,470
Oh, somebody's dead!

2586
01:58:56,800 --> 01:59:00,260
Someone wrote during the day near the cafe class.

2587
01:59:00,420 --> 01:59:01,060
Where's cafe?

2588
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:03,700
So, it was here.

2589
01:59:04,640 --> 01:59:05,980
That they wrote the notebook.

2590
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:07,860
Hmm.

2591
01:59:12,240 --> 01:59:12,900
Yeah?

2592
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:14,400
What are you doing?

2593
01:59:16,980 --> 01:59:18,140
What are you doing over there?

2594
01:59:18,140 --> 01:59:18,920
You're not saying anything.

2595
01:59:20,860 --> 01:59:21,420
Okay.

2596
01:59:23,980 --> 01:59:24,680
You're not talking.

2597
01:59:25,020 --> 01:59:26,400
Why aren't you talking, Mint?

2598
01:59:27,620 --> 01:59:29,240
Why are you just staring at me?

2599
01:59:29,420 --> 01:59:29,600
Huh?

2600
01:59:30,440 --> 01:59:31,120
Fucking freak.

2601
01:59:33,680 --> 01:59:37,120
I swear, if I die, if I die right here, I swear to God.

2602
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:42,000
Oh?

2603
01:59:42,820 --> 01:59:43,860
Who is it?

2604
01:59:50,930 --> 01:59:52,870
This is so funny.

2605
01:59:53,370 --> 01:59:54,590
This is so funny.

2606
01:59:55,210 --> 02:00:00,410
I love to speak death and like just harassing the person I'm talking to.

2607
02:00:03,530 --> 02:00:03,970
Oh!

2608
02:00:04,310 --> 02:00:05,090
Oh my God!

2609
02:00:05,810 --> 02:00:07,530
Live and bow!

2610
02:00:08,610 --> 02:00:11,910
Okay, I'm just wondering this time for sure, you guys can hear me now, right?

2611
02:00:12,110 --> 02:00:12,410
Yeah.

2612
02:00:12,670 --> 02:00:13,110
Yeah.

2613
02:00:13,330 --> 02:00:18,610
So, new update on this, I can't hear anybody, but I can actually hear all the people who are dead.

2614
02:00:19,010 --> 02:00:20,010
So, but they can't hear me.

2615
02:00:20,590 --> 02:00:22,050
Wait, Doki, were you talking to me?

2616
02:00:22,050 --> 02:00:24,670
Yeah, yeah, I think the mic bugged out too.

2617
02:00:24,670 --> 02:00:26,010
Yes, I can hear you!

2618
02:00:26,490 --> 02:00:33,110
I found Limu's dead body and her notebook had Mint only circled.

2619
02:00:34,990 --> 02:00:37,210
I can perform a seance with the dead.

2620
02:00:37,350 --> 02:00:38,350
Guys, just listen to me.

2621
02:00:42,570 --> 02:00:44,610
What do the dead say, Snuffy?

2622
02:00:44,770 --> 02:00:45,770
What are they telling you?

2623
02:00:46,390 --> 02:00:47,330
Guys, who killed you?

2624
02:00:47,610 --> 02:00:48,210
Let me know.

2625
02:00:50,010 --> 02:00:52,430
Let them speak through you, Snuffy.

2626
02:00:52,430 --> 02:00:53,650
That's so funny.

2627
02:00:53,670 --> 02:00:55,590
Is that why you weren't saying anything when I was talking to you?

2628
02:00:55,610 --> 02:00:57,270
Yeah, I kept trying to be like Amelie.

2629
02:00:58,110 --> 02:00:59,790
You couldn't say, I couldn't hear you.

2630
02:01:00,050 --> 02:01:02,210
I thought you were just being funny and flipping the deck.

2631
02:01:02,750 --> 02:01:05,510
What is Fow, Limu and Juniper saying?

2632
02:01:05,670 --> 02:01:07,110
What were Juniper's final words?

2633
02:01:07,370 --> 02:01:10,210
He asked her why she was like, it's Snuffy in the end.

2634
02:01:12,230 --> 02:01:14,550
I like how Snuffy is legend, legend.

2635
02:01:14,690 --> 02:01:15,670
FBI, FBI.

2636
02:01:17,950 --> 02:01:19,610
Open up, FBI, FBI.

2637
02:01:20,810 --> 02:01:21,470
That's me.

2638
02:01:23,070 --> 02:01:28,150
Sorry, Mint, but in the beginning, I was next to you and my ID card was stolen.

2639
02:01:28,310 --> 02:01:32,010
And then now, Limehunter name circled, so it makes me think it's you.

2640
02:01:32,430 --> 02:01:34,390
I was investigating you.

2641
02:01:34,610 --> 02:01:35,910
Oh, you know what?

2642
02:01:35,930 --> 02:01:37,810
It was just to investigate you.

2643
02:01:38,730 --> 02:01:39,570
That's suspicious.

2644
02:01:40,910 --> 02:01:41,910
Here's the thing.

2645
02:01:41,990 --> 02:01:44,970
When I talked to an NPC like last round, who was like, oh, yeah.

2646
02:01:45,330 --> 02:01:48,430
Well, in this area, someone was seen at night opening a book.

2647
02:01:48,430 --> 02:01:54,270
It had just turned to nighttime like 20 seconds before and only Mint was in that area.

2648
02:01:54,270 --> 02:01:55,190
I'd like to read a good book.

2649
02:01:55,870 --> 02:01:57,010
But it could have been you too.

2650
02:01:57,310 --> 02:01:58,490
What do you mean by that?

2651
02:01:59,130 --> 02:02:01,930
I wouldn't have talked to that guy if it was me.

2652
02:02:03,270 --> 02:02:04,210
He's gonna die tomorrow.

2653
02:02:04,210 --> 02:02:04,970
You could be making that up.

2654
02:02:05,090 --> 02:02:05,450
I know.

2655
02:02:05,570 --> 02:02:06,130
I talked to him.

2656
02:02:06,470 --> 02:02:07,790
Oh, look at her.

2657
02:02:07,910 --> 02:02:09,390
She's stumbling.

2658
02:02:09,510 --> 02:02:11,510
She's panicking just like Kira would.

2659
02:02:21,670 --> 02:02:24,010
I actually can't tell who's dead and who's alive.

2660
02:02:24,050 --> 02:02:26,890
So if I'm responding to people you can't even hear, I'm so sorry.

2661
02:02:35,550 --> 02:02:37,610
What do they have to say about Mint?

2662
02:02:37,610 --> 02:02:39,530
I don't know why I'm just farting.

2663
02:02:39,530 --> 02:02:40,150
I'm innocent!

2664
02:02:40,490 --> 02:02:41,230
Why am I innocent?

2665
02:02:41,450 --> 02:02:43,290
You literally said long live Kira!

2666
02:02:44,530 --> 02:02:46,330
I mean, I'm a follower.

2667
02:02:49,830 --> 02:02:52,330
I should have given the notebook to you, Snuffy.

2668
02:02:52,630 --> 02:02:52,930
You got dead.

2669
02:02:59,530 --> 02:03:00,730
I'm inexperienced.

2670
02:03:01,150 --> 02:03:02,290
Don't blame me.

2671
02:03:02,290 --> 02:03:08,330
Can't believe the person whose name... Whose shirt is literally saying Kira was Kira.

2672
02:03:16,430 --> 02:03:19,770
Oh my God, you're making Death Note 2 on Netflix?

2673
02:03:20,670 --> 02:03:20,970
Yeah.

2674
02:03:22,610 --> 02:03:24,030
My guy locked up forever.

2675
02:03:24,750 --> 02:03:25,890
You're looking a little goofy.

2676
02:03:32,290 --> 02:03:34,290
It's always the one you least suspect.

2677
02:03:50,270 --> 02:03:52,310
Her final message.

2678
02:03:53,470 --> 02:03:53,850
Mint.

2679
02:03:54,730 --> 02:03:57,850
I wonder what a circle around Mint's name could mean.

2680
02:03:58,410 --> 02:04:00,110
I'm sorry, Mint.

2681
02:04:00,110 --> 02:04:02,590
Vaibhav was actually playing the game.

2682
02:04:04,190 --> 02:04:05,690
Circle people's names?

2683
02:04:05,930 --> 02:04:07,410
Yeah, that's what the notebook is for.

2684
02:04:07,530 --> 02:04:09,010
You can like circle...

2685
02:04:09,010 --> 02:04:13,290
To be fair, I've been Kira like 99% of the time.

2686
02:04:13,970 --> 02:04:14,510
Wait a minute.

2687
02:04:15,270 --> 02:04:16,510
Oh, well, this is awkward.

2688
02:04:17,370 --> 02:04:19,610
Oh my God, we have so many chefs here!

2689
02:04:19,970 --> 02:04:21,310
Too many chefs.

2690
02:04:22,190 --> 02:04:25,190
Too many chefs.

2691
02:04:25,890 --> 02:04:27,830
Too many cooks.

2692
02:04:27,830 --> 02:04:31,850
We're all getting the same stuff at the same time, so everyone ends up wearing the same shit.

2693
02:04:32,450 --> 02:04:33,310
That's not true.

2694
02:04:33,370 --> 02:04:34,750
I picked a bow instead.

2695
02:04:35,050 --> 02:04:35,470
That's right.

2696
02:04:35,870 --> 02:04:37,470
I'm trying to make myself look atrocious.

2697
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:40,310
I wanted to look cute.

2698
02:04:40,730 --> 02:04:41,210
I'm adorable.

2699
02:04:41,890 --> 02:04:43,370
I wanted to look cute.

2700
02:04:44,250 --> 02:04:47,050
I like how Snuffy is the only one that took the shower cap.

2701
02:04:48,430 --> 02:04:48,910
She's...

2702
02:04:48,910 --> 02:04:50,290
Nobody else.

2703
02:04:51,490 --> 02:04:51,970
Oh!

2704
02:04:52,650 --> 02:04:54,850
So I have to use it.

2705
02:04:55,790 --> 02:04:56,390
Alright, alright, you guys ready?

2706
02:04:56,470 --> 02:04:58,050
Wait, what do you want to change in the rules?

2707
02:04:58,350 --> 02:05:01,310
You know on like Gaia Online when people were fangirling over L?

2708
02:05:01,410 --> 02:05:02,570
This is how they drew him.

2709
02:05:02,830 --> 02:05:05,250
Just with a cute little bow and pretty glasses.

2710
02:05:05,390 --> 02:05:06,750
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah!

2711
02:05:06,930 --> 02:05:08,510
You don't even have the roundness I do!

2712
02:05:08,610 --> 02:05:09,010
So cute!

2713
02:05:10,530 --> 02:05:11,770
Baby girl L!

2714
02:05:12,310 --> 02:05:14,450
Baby girl L!

2715
02:05:15,030 --> 02:05:17,110
Welcoming a brand new girl.

2716
02:05:19,250 --> 02:05:20,210
Let's see...

2717
02:05:20,210 --> 02:05:23,270
A mellow or a matte fan?

2718
02:05:24,410 --> 02:05:26,810
Alright, I'm upping the multiplier.

2719
02:05:30,710 --> 02:05:31,490
Which one?

2720
02:05:31,690 --> 02:05:32,970
What was your favorite fella?

2721
02:05:35,230 --> 02:05:35,930
Mosquito.

2722
02:05:39,090 --> 02:05:39,690
Mosquito?

2723
02:05:42,170 --> 02:05:44,230
Oh no.

2724
02:05:45,930 --> 02:05:46,930
Oh no.

2725
02:05:47,170 --> 02:05:50,190
Alright, I made it so that tasks go by faster now.

2726
02:05:50,670 --> 02:05:51,850
So it puts more percentage.

2727
02:05:52,430 --> 02:05:53,950
Alright, let's see if it does work though.

2728
02:05:55,070 --> 02:05:56,130
It definitely won't for me.

2729
02:05:56,190 --> 02:05:56,810
Good luck everybody.

2730
02:06:02,630 --> 02:06:03,670
Oh no.

2731
02:06:04,750 --> 02:06:05,670
I gotta make sure...

2732
02:06:07,030 --> 02:06:08,450
Approximity chat's not on.

2733
02:06:12,790 --> 02:06:14,450
I gotta make sure guys.

2734
02:06:18,920 --> 02:06:19,480
Hey!

2735
02:06:20,920 --> 02:06:21,480
Cappy.

2736
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:23,120
Oh, you like it?

2737
02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:24,360
You think it's pretty?

2738
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:25,700
Yeah?

2739
02:06:28,820 --> 02:06:29,380
Yeah!

2740
02:06:30,080 --> 02:06:31,180
It's Louis Vuitton!

2741
02:06:32,040 --> 02:06:32,560
I'm looking.

2742
02:06:33,380 --> 02:06:34,620
Oh, you're investigating!

2743
02:06:43,850 --> 02:06:46,490
Gotta make sure guys I'm not using my voice chat.

2744
02:06:46,630 --> 02:06:47,470
I gotta make sure.

2745
02:06:48,630 --> 02:06:49,730
I gotta make sure.

2746
02:06:51,070 --> 02:06:51,870
Kira.

2747
02:06:52,190 --> 02:06:53,470
Are you there Kira?

2748
02:07:01,270 --> 02:07:01,550
Oh.

2749
02:07:05,430 --> 02:07:06,810
What you doing?

2750
02:07:07,030 --> 02:07:07,270
Huh?

2751
02:07:07,670 --> 02:07:08,910
What you doing?

2752
02:07:09,970 --> 02:07:11,050
Are you...

2753
02:07:11,490 --> 02:07:12,790
Singing a little song?

2754
02:07:12,970 --> 02:07:13,270
Whoa!

2755
02:07:19,830 --> 02:07:21,810
There's a camera in that area.

2756
02:07:32,440 --> 02:07:33,040
Oh.

2757
02:07:33,720 --> 02:07:35,100
Time to resolve.

2758
02:07:38,830 --> 02:07:39,430
Okay.

2759
02:07:43,610 --> 02:07:44,730
I'm resolving.

2760
02:07:45,430 --> 02:07:46,870
I'm doing my job.

2761
02:07:47,630 --> 02:07:48,650
I'm a good person.

2762
02:07:50,230 --> 02:07:51,170
You have...

2763
02:07:51,710 --> 02:07:53,610
Do you have any IDs on you?

2764
02:07:56,990 --> 02:07:59,130
Guys, I don't think Amelie knows about the...

2765
02:07:59,130 --> 02:08:00,950
I don't think Amelie knows about the...

2766
02:08:01,670 --> 02:08:02,570
Transmitter guys.

2767
02:08:02,690 --> 02:08:04,770
I don't think she knows about the transmitter.

2768
02:08:07,990 --> 02:08:09,010
I'm trying to...

2769
02:08:09,010 --> 02:08:11,390
I'm trying to tell her about the transmitter.

2770
02:08:13,530 --> 02:08:14,050
No!

2771
02:08:18,030 --> 02:08:18,550
No!

2772
02:08:26,590 --> 02:08:29,150
Amelie, Amelie, Amelie, Amelie, Amelie, Amelie.

2773
02:08:29,230 --> 02:08:31,070
Follow me, follow me, follow me Amelie.

2774
02:08:40,610 --> 02:08:41,630
Bye Amelie.

2775
02:08:46,610 --> 02:08:47,410
Kill them.

2776
02:08:47,630 --> 02:08:48,850
You know you want to.

2777
02:08:49,630 --> 02:08:50,430
Kill them.

2778
02:08:51,930 --> 02:08:52,790
Yeah, me too.

2779
02:08:57,410 --> 02:08:59,710
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2780
02:08:59,770 --> 02:09:00,590
What are you trying to do?

2781
02:09:00,990 --> 02:09:01,270
What are you...

2782
02:09:01,270 --> 02:09:01,650
Oh!

2783
02:09:01,990 --> 02:09:03,230
What are you trying to do?

2784
02:09:04,210 --> 02:09:05,490
Snuffy, are you trying to steal my ID?

2785
02:09:06,290 --> 02:09:07,990
Are you trying to steal my ID, Snuffy?

2786
02:09:08,190 --> 02:09:09,350
Oh wait, I forgot you can't...

2787
02:09:09,350 --> 02:09:10,610
You can't talk right now.

2788
02:09:15,660 --> 02:09:16,060
No!

2789
02:09:16,820 --> 02:09:17,880
Don't post my name!

2790
02:09:19,540 --> 02:09:20,020
No!

2791
02:09:23,230 --> 02:09:24,950
Because she's so powerful.

2792
02:09:25,550 --> 02:09:26,730
Oh my god.

2793
02:09:27,070 --> 02:09:28,790
Dude, this happens to her every game.

2794
02:09:28,870 --> 02:09:32,250
If she's not the first to like be a killer, she's the first to die.

2795
02:09:34,290 --> 02:09:35,650
I like how...

2796
02:09:35,650 --> 02:09:38,630
I like how like she's always ran over by a truck too.

2797
02:09:38,710 --> 02:09:39,590
It's always a truck.

2798
02:09:39,810 --> 02:09:41,530
That's the third time she's been hit by a truck.

2799
02:09:42,050 --> 02:09:42,870
There's like...

2800
02:09:42,870 --> 02:09:44,210
There's like other choices.

2801
02:09:44,450 --> 02:09:48,690
There was gun, chandelier, all that shit, but they picked the truck.

2802
02:09:50,810 --> 02:09:51,310
That's just the signature.

2803
02:09:52,750 --> 02:09:53,970
That's just the signature.

2804
02:09:54,910 --> 02:09:58,850
Limu, what did she say?

2805
02:10:00,600 --> 02:10:01,610
What is she saying?

2806
02:10:02,210 --> 02:10:03,130
What is Limu saying?

2807
02:10:07,850 --> 02:10:10,330
You're impressing Goosetalker!

2808
02:10:13,350 --> 02:10:15,590
Because like I was Kira before.

2809
02:10:15,590 --> 02:10:18,350
Yeah, but you literally made me shoot myself.

2810
02:10:18,470 --> 02:10:19,230
I literally made...

2811
02:10:19,230 --> 02:10:22,230
I literally made Selfie like shoot herself with a Nerf gun.

2812
02:10:22,430 --> 02:10:24,810
You mentioned all the choices that you could pick.

2813
02:10:25,930 --> 02:10:26,710
Yeah, because I was looking.

2814
02:10:26,810 --> 02:10:28,910
I was like thinking like, what do I make them do?

2815
02:10:30,750 --> 02:10:36,430
Doki got really close to me and then did nothing about it and just turned around and like didn't go anywhere and she just wanted to get really close to me.

2816
02:10:36,550 --> 02:10:37,190
That was kind of...

2817
02:10:37,190 --> 02:10:37,770
What do you mean?

2818
02:10:37,790 --> 02:10:40,530
I was doing the fucking investigating body thing.

2819
02:10:41,190 --> 02:10:43,670
I got my ID stolen though from that pile.

2820
02:10:46,430 --> 02:10:47,810
Wait, who said that?

2821
02:10:51,790 --> 02:10:52,270
What?

2822
02:10:57,570 --> 02:10:58,030
No, no.

2823
02:10:58,130 --> 02:10:59,630
I killed two people.

2824
02:10:59,890 --> 02:11:04,910
No, I killed Snuffy and someone else and then I gave the book to somebody else.

2825
02:11:05,830 --> 02:11:06,890
Alright, call me as Kira.

2826
02:11:07,070 --> 02:11:09,770
You're gonna be so surprised when it's not me.

2827
02:11:10,250 --> 02:11:11,350
Yeah, waste that.

2828
02:11:11,530 --> 02:11:12,230
Do it.

2829
02:11:12,290 --> 02:11:13,230
Vote for me right now.

2830
02:11:13,330 --> 02:11:13,690
Do it.

2831
02:11:14,190 --> 02:11:14,930
Do it.

2832
02:11:15,590 --> 02:11:18,010
Get me arrested right now.

2833
02:11:21,130 --> 02:11:22,030
Do it.

2834
02:11:22,330 --> 02:11:22,890
Arrest me.

2835
02:11:25,570 --> 02:11:26,910
Arrest... Yeah, do it.

2836
02:11:27,430 --> 02:11:28,130
Arrest me.

2837
02:11:28,270 --> 02:11:28,750
Come on.

2838
02:11:28,830 --> 02:11:30,270
I wanna be handcuffed to somebody.

2839
02:11:30,370 --> 02:11:30,950
Do it.

2840
02:11:31,650 --> 02:11:33,650
I wanna be handcuffed.

2841
02:11:34,790 --> 02:11:35,030
Yeah.

2842
02:11:36,810 --> 02:11:37,730
Do it.

2843
02:11:37,990 --> 02:11:39,170
What if it's my kink?

2844
02:11:45,590 --> 02:11:47,610
What if it's what I'm into?

2845
02:11:47,970 --> 02:11:48,470
Do it.

2846
02:11:51,270 --> 02:11:53,550
Put me in handcuffs.

2847
02:11:54,370 --> 02:11:54,950
Come on.

2848
02:11:55,450 --> 02:11:57,030
Someone handcuff me to somebody.

2849
02:12:02,530 --> 02:12:07,150
If I lost my ID too, I was investigating that one body by myself.

2850
02:12:16,910 --> 02:12:21,030
I think someone applied a little funny thing when you vote someone else.

2851
02:12:21,130 --> 02:12:21,650
That's right.

2852
02:12:21,690 --> 02:12:22,530
Who am I attached to?

2853
02:12:22,570 --> 02:12:23,370
Am I attached to Snuffy?

2854
02:12:24,430 --> 02:12:25,330
Yeah, that's right.

2855
02:12:25,550 --> 02:12:26,870
What if I'm into that Snuffy?

2856
02:12:27,150 --> 02:12:27,730
That's right.

2857
02:12:27,910 --> 02:12:28,170
Yeah.

2858
02:12:28,790 --> 02:12:29,610
Okay, wait.

2859
02:12:30,050 --> 02:12:34,450
Wait a minute.

2860
02:12:36,430 --> 02:12:38,190
Okay, now you can start barking for me.

2861
02:12:38,210 --> 02:12:39,170
Oh, look at that!

2862
02:12:39,550 --> 02:12:40,010
Nothing!

2863
02:12:40,990 --> 02:12:42,210
Look at that!

2864
02:12:43,130 --> 02:12:45,490
That's right, and now I get to be attached to you.

2865
02:12:54,910 --> 02:12:55,630
No.

2866
02:12:58,030 --> 02:12:59,410
I'm gone.

2867
02:13:04,230 --> 02:13:07,510
If I were Kira, you'd be dead!

2868
02:13:16,250 --> 02:13:17,890
That's fucking right.

2869
02:13:18,970 --> 02:13:22,110
If I was Kira, you'd be dead by now.

2870
02:13:22,230 --> 02:13:23,210
That's fucking right.

2871
02:13:28,200 --> 02:13:30,740
I will be the god of the new world!

2872
02:13:40,010 --> 02:13:41,130
Joke's on you guys.

2873
02:13:41,170 --> 02:13:41,890
I like this.

2874
02:13:44,710 --> 02:13:46,330
I'm just standing here.

2875
02:13:47,190 --> 02:13:48,050
I got a lost item.

2876
02:13:50,950 --> 02:13:51,810
I did it.

2877
02:13:51,890 --> 02:13:52,750
I did my task.

2878
02:13:55,070 --> 02:13:56,150
Wait, it's what?

2879
02:13:57,810 --> 02:13:58,770
What happened?

2880
02:13:59,090 --> 02:14:00,570
Five people resolving?

2881
02:14:00,870 --> 02:14:01,150
Okay.

2882
02:14:01,750 --> 02:14:03,110
Well, that's a lot of resolvers.

2883
02:14:03,750 --> 02:14:04,790
A lot of resolvers.

2884
02:14:04,950 --> 02:14:06,350
Oh gosh, all of us are in here.

2885
02:14:06,590 --> 02:14:08,850
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on?

2886
02:14:09,050 --> 02:14:10,210
A lot of people.

2887
02:14:13,170 --> 02:14:15,210
Wait, how do you know it's Amelie?

2888
02:14:15,290 --> 02:14:15,830
Wait, what?

2889
02:14:15,830 --> 02:14:17,830
Because all she did was...

2890
02:14:19,490 --> 02:14:24,010
Limu was only in contact with Bao and Amelie.

2891
02:14:24,410 --> 02:14:28,330
And Amelie is so sus.

2892
02:14:33,370 --> 02:14:34,410
What?

2893
02:14:35,830 --> 02:14:37,010
I'm not hopeless.

2894
02:14:45,290 --> 02:14:46,450
I'll keep watch.

2895
02:14:46,590 --> 02:14:48,150
I have something to give you.

2896
02:14:49,230 --> 02:14:49,710
Snuffy.

2897
02:14:52,010 --> 02:14:53,690
I have something to give you.

2898
02:14:54,270 --> 02:14:55,150
Yeah, that's right.

2899
02:14:57,630 --> 02:14:58,110
That's right.

2900
02:14:58,210 --> 02:14:59,050
Amelie, I can't do anything.

2901
02:14:59,410 --> 02:15:00,510
I can't do anything.

2902
02:15:00,610 --> 02:15:01,070
You die.

2903
02:15:01,170 --> 02:15:01,630
It's on you.

2904
02:15:01,710 --> 02:15:02,430
I can't do it.

2905
02:15:02,430 --> 02:15:03,010
I can't.

2906
02:15:09,330 --> 02:15:12,230
Who is L?

2907
02:15:14,210 --> 02:15:15,750
I don't know.

2908
02:15:21,590 --> 02:15:22,530
Goodbye.

2909
02:15:23,410 --> 02:15:24,630
Goodbye.

2910
02:15:27,510 --> 02:15:31,770
Sorry, Grimmie, I tried to spread your nostrils.

2911
02:15:32,410 --> 02:15:33,510
His nostrils.

2912
02:15:33,510 --> 02:15:37,010
So easy.

2913
02:15:37,370 --> 02:15:39,010
Let's go.

2914
02:15:40,530 --> 02:15:41,650
That's right.

2915
02:15:41,910 --> 02:15:43,630
Okay, but I was right about Doki.

2916
02:15:43,750 --> 02:15:44,810
I was right about Doki.

2917
02:15:44,850 --> 02:15:45,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2918
02:15:45,790 --> 02:15:47,990
I gave away my IDs before.

2919
02:15:49,590 --> 02:15:51,350
She passed off the book.

2920
02:15:52,130 --> 02:15:53,430
No, I didn't.

2921
02:15:53,550 --> 02:15:55,630
Amelie was actually the cure-all.

2922
02:15:56,270 --> 02:15:58,390
I was just giving her all the IDs.

2923
02:15:58,810 --> 02:16:03,150
But I had no IDs, so I could live.

2924
02:16:04,090 --> 02:16:07,450
This is actually more fun when you kind of get the idea of the game.

2925
02:16:07,470 --> 02:16:08,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2926
02:16:09,130 --> 02:16:10,450
Can we play another one?

2927
02:16:10,510 --> 02:16:11,070
I'm gonna try.

2928
02:16:13,070 --> 02:16:14,550
I tried doing that before.

2929
02:16:14,670 --> 02:16:15,730
It didn't work, so I don't know.

2930
02:16:16,390 --> 02:16:18,610
Was it the sound settings thing?

2931
02:16:19,690 --> 02:16:21,330
No, because I can still hear everybody.

2932
02:16:21,430 --> 02:16:22,550
Right now, I can hear everybody.

2933
02:16:22,710 --> 02:16:24,450
It's literally only when the game plays.

2934
02:16:24,750 --> 02:16:25,650
That's so weird.

2935
02:16:27,250 --> 02:16:30,950
And I can hear Limes, but she can't hear me and she's also dead and I'm not.

2936
02:16:31,590 --> 02:16:32,510
It's so weird.

2937
02:16:32,510 --> 02:16:34,390
It's like day one bug, maybe.

2938
02:16:35,630 --> 02:16:38,430
Alright, let's see.

2939
02:16:39,130 --> 02:16:42,290
Oh my God, there's just as planned for customization.

2940
02:16:42,490 --> 02:16:44,610
As long as Snuffy can still hear me, I'm gonna like...

2941
02:16:44,610 --> 02:16:46,690
Annoy the shit out of her every time I die, I guess.

2942
02:16:47,230 --> 02:16:48,390
She's like the seance.

2943
02:16:49,170 --> 02:16:50,510
We're ready to...

2944
02:16:51,550 --> 02:16:52,430
We're like...

2945
02:16:52,430 --> 02:16:54,310
Lime, what is Lime saying?

2946
02:16:54,630 --> 02:16:56,530
Snuffy, tell us her final words.

2947
02:16:56,670 --> 02:16:57,410
What is it?

2948
02:17:01,770 --> 02:17:02,610
Are we all here?

2949
02:17:02,650 --> 02:17:03,490
Wait, we're missing one person.

2950
02:17:04,990 --> 02:17:06,310
Did Snuffy leave?

2951
02:17:06,530 --> 02:17:08,490
Oh yeah, Snuffy's trying to fix it.

2952
02:17:10,430 --> 02:17:11,670
Snuffy's trying to fix it.

2953
02:17:11,970 --> 02:17:13,490
We're slowly understanding the game now.

2954
02:17:13,750 --> 02:17:16,290
I hope they have different maps in the future.

2955
02:17:17,170 --> 02:17:21,830
Yeah, and like different tasks to do rather than just talk to people.

2956
02:17:22,530 --> 02:17:22,710
Yeah, yeah.

2957
02:17:23,270 --> 02:17:27,610
To be fair, this game came out so fucking fast.

2958
02:17:27,770 --> 02:17:28,990
So I feel like they're like...

2959
02:17:28,990 --> 02:17:29,770
Got dropping now.

2960
02:17:29,770 --> 02:17:32,510
For what reason?

2961
02:17:32,690 --> 02:17:35,550
It needs a little bit of like cleaning up, but...

2962
02:17:35,550 --> 02:17:36,550
I like the ideas of it.

2963
02:17:37,010 --> 02:17:37,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2964
02:17:37,830 --> 02:17:39,110
It's another alternative.

2965
02:17:41,130 --> 02:17:43,210
Little among us, definite alternative.

2966
02:17:44,090 --> 02:17:45,950
It makes you think and like...

2967
02:17:45,950 --> 02:17:49,110
Suspect people in different ways because of the textbooks and stuff.

2968
02:17:49,690 --> 02:17:50,770
Yeah, then you gotta like...

2969
02:17:51,470 --> 02:17:52,690
Look everywhere, you're like...

2970
02:17:52,690 --> 02:17:53,750
Why are you so close to me?

2971
02:17:54,390 --> 02:17:54,630
Huh?

2972
02:17:55,370 --> 02:17:56,950
Why are you so close to me?

2973
02:17:56,970 --> 02:17:58,230
Every little thing makes you...

2974
02:17:58,230 --> 02:17:58,830
Yeah, yeah.

2975
02:17:59,290 --> 02:18:00,690
I also like the music.

2976
02:18:00,790 --> 02:18:01,690
I think the music is good.

2977
02:18:01,810 --> 02:18:03,330
Yeah, she was like...

2978
02:18:03,330 --> 02:18:04,310
It's like...

2979
02:18:05,730 --> 02:18:08,290
Supposed to practice COVID protocols here.

2980
02:18:08,450 --> 02:18:09,550
Why are you guys all so close?

2981
02:18:12,270 --> 02:18:13,470
Guys, guys.

2982
02:18:13,630 --> 02:18:16,050
Only one person here is wearing a mask, right?

2983
02:18:16,130 --> 02:18:17,790
Two people are wearing masks.

2984
02:18:17,930 --> 02:18:18,850
What's wrong with you guys?

2985
02:18:19,030 --> 02:18:21,530
I'm spreading my germs in all directions.

2986
02:18:21,850 --> 02:18:23,050
I'm literally...

2987
02:18:23,050 --> 02:18:25,630
Yeah, I'm literally sneezing right now.

2988
02:18:25,710 --> 02:18:26,990
I wonder who gave it.

2989
02:18:28,910 --> 02:18:30,770
Alright, Snuffy, can you hear us?

2990
02:18:31,710 --> 02:18:32,170
Yes.

2991
02:18:32,490 --> 02:18:32,870
Okay.

2992
02:18:33,710 --> 02:18:35,370
Alright, I'm starting the game.

2993
02:18:36,030 --> 02:18:37,350
We'll have to see in the game.

2994
02:18:38,290 --> 02:18:40,430
If someone's next to Snuffy, confirm.

2995
02:18:41,150 --> 02:18:42,690
Okay, hoping for you.

2996
02:18:46,950 --> 02:18:47,550
Investigating.

2997
02:18:49,890 --> 02:18:53,010
Can't wait to write some names on the notebook.

2998
02:18:54,150 --> 02:18:54,930
Wait, what do you mean?

2999
02:18:54,930 --> 02:18:59,290
Oh my God, I can't wait to write some names.

3000
02:19:00,230 --> 02:19:02,850
I'm so excited to write names on that notebook.

3001
02:19:04,090 --> 02:19:04,610
Whoa!

3002
02:19:05,270 --> 02:19:05,570
Hey.

3003
02:19:07,710 --> 02:19:08,110
Hey.

3004
02:19:08,870 --> 02:19:10,290
Look, we can work together.

3005
02:19:10,930 --> 02:19:12,010
Bow, we can work together.

3006
02:19:12,210 --> 02:19:13,950
Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow.

3007
02:19:13,970 --> 02:19:14,890
We can...

3008
02:19:14,890 --> 02:19:16,850
Bow, bow, we can work together.

3009
02:19:17,530 --> 02:19:19,250
Bow, we can...

3010
02:19:26,630 --> 02:19:27,190
Hahaha.

3011
02:19:31,490 --> 02:19:32,670
Just as planned.

3012
02:19:36,810 --> 02:19:37,370
Alright.

3013
02:19:38,750 --> 02:19:40,670
Someone may have stolen my ID.

3014
02:19:40,910 --> 02:19:41,930
Who stole my ID?

3015
02:19:43,990 --> 02:19:45,950
Silly me, nobody can steal my ID.

3016
02:19:47,710 --> 02:19:49,070
Okay, we gotta get...

3017
02:19:49,870 --> 02:19:50,890
Whoa, whoa.

3018
02:19:51,550 --> 02:19:51,890
Hello.

3019
02:19:53,110 --> 02:19:53,670
Whoa.

3020
02:19:54,090 --> 02:19:55,510
Why are you guys all so close to me?

3021
02:19:55,630 --> 02:19:56,470
Whoa, hey Snuffy.

3022
02:19:57,850 --> 02:19:59,310
You hear me, Snuffy?

3023
02:20:03,070 --> 02:20:05,410
Okay, I completed all my tasks.

3024
02:20:07,030 --> 02:20:07,090
Oh?

3025
02:20:11,670 --> 02:20:12,350
Monitor.

3026
02:20:16,290 --> 02:20:19,930
Let's see, I need a...

3027
02:20:20,510 --> 02:20:21,530
Death note test.

3028
02:20:22,830 --> 02:20:25,030
Oh, okay, back down I go.

3029
02:20:25,030 --> 02:20:25,910
Whoa.

3030
02:20:33,690 --> 02:20:35,210
Don't worry, I got you guys.

3031
02:20:35,270 --> 02:20:36,830
I'm guarding, I'm guarding all of you.

3032
02:20:37,710 --> 02:20:39,630
Making sure everybody is okay.

3033
02:20:45,910 --> 02:20:48,010
Mika, why aren't you doing it?

3034
02:20:48,230 --> 02:20:49,470
Why are you close to them?

3035
02:20:50,730 --> 02:20:52,990
Why are you guarding them so close up?

3036
02:20:53,770 --> 02:20:56,530
That's a weird way to guard bodies, that's all I'm saying.

3037
02:20:57,290 --> 02:20:59,710
Alright guys, I don't think we can...

3038
02:21:02,130 --> 02:21:04,430
No, we were all at the bottom, right?

3039
02:21:04,970 --> 02:21:08,710
We were being a little bit too frisky.

3040
02:21:11,410 --> 02:21:13,450
We were way too close to each other.

3041
02:21:15,550 --> 02:21:19,250
Talking to a transmitter during the night?

3042
02:21:19,970 --> 02:21:22,430
It literally just turned into night.

3043
02:21:22,430 --> 02:21:27,210
Huh, that's... yeah, Giga is mega sus.

3044
02:21:30,210 --> 02:21:31,310
During the day?

3045
02:21:31,730 --> 02:21:32,610
Wait, that doesn't...

3046
02:21:32,610 --> 02:21:32,830
What?

3047
02:21:32,910 --> 02:21:35,650
Everybody, I spam that transmitter all the time.

3048
02:21:39,210 --> 02:21:41,090
Oh, who do I have to do this to?

3049
02:21:41,570 --> 02:21:42,170
Oh, monitor.

3050
02:21:42,950 --> 02:21:43,350
Juniper!

3051
02:21:46,210 --> 02:21:46,550
Oh?

3052
02:21:51,090 --> 02:21:54,270
Make a contact with collaborator to publicly reveal?

3053
02:21:54,270 --> 02:21:55,890
How do we publicly reveal?

3054
02:22:00,600 --> 02:22:02,440
Oh, okay, Amelie is safe.

3055
02:22:02,520 --> 02:22:03,300
Amelie is safe.

3056
02:22:03,740 --> 02:22:05,700
Was suspicious, but she's actually clear now.

3057
02:22:06,060 --> 02:22:07,280
I'm actually clean!

3058
02:22:08,180 --> 02:22:08,660
What?

3059
02:22:09,120 --> 02:22:11,360
Someone in my chat literally just said, Amelie sus.

3060
02:22:15,100 --> 02:22:17,300
Well, Amelie just gets a pass now.

3061
02:22:17,480 --> 02:22:18,760
It just says she was an investigator.

3062
02:22:19,400 --> 02:22:20,300
I trust that.

3063
02:22:22,200 --> 02:22:23,500
She's not sus?

3064
02:22:24,820 --> 02:22:25,920
You're dumb!

3065
02:22:27,080 --> 02:22:27,740
Nothing happened.

3066
02:22:29,220 --> 02:22:30,220
Nobody's dead.

3067
02:22:32,540 --> 02:22:36,040
Yeah, that's weird that nobody did anything.

3068
02:22:38,860 --> 02:22:40,820
Who hasn't got Kira yet?

3069
02:22:49,920 --> 02:22:50,560
Whoa!

3070
02:22:51,060 --> 02:22:52,100
And who do you...

3071
02:22:52,100 --> 02:22:53,580
Oh, my ID was stolen, but...

3072
02:22:57,760 --> 02:23:00,300
I think it's Bao.

3073
02:23:02,040 --> 02:23:04,300
My ID was stolen, mine was.

3074
02:23:13,700 --> 02:23:16,660
And what is your last investigation?

3075
02:23:30,960 --> 02:23:31,780
Hmm...

3076
02:23:31,780 --> 02:23:35,080
Yeah, and I was next to Bao and...

3077
02:23:38,380 --> 02:23:44,600
You were whacking off?

3078
02:23:46,220 --> 02:23:49,280
You were next to the body whacking off?

3079
02:23:57,080 --> 02:24:00,080
And how would you know that, investigator?

3080
02:24:01,140 --> 02:24:02,960
How would you know that?

3081
02:24:06,080 --> 02:24:09,320
Only a Kira follower could watch.

3082
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:18,860
Limo?

3083
02:24:19,040 --> 02:24:20,160
She is awfully quiet.

3084
02:24:29,860 --> 02:24:32,040
Limo is alive, it has to be her.

3085
02:24:36,780 --> 02:24:38,200
You're right, Limo.

3086
02:24:39,220 --> 02:24:41,240
It's a little suspicious that you're still alive.

3087
02:24:44,560 --> 02:24:46,080
A little weird, a little wacky.

3088
02:24:47,900 --> 02:24:48,120
I think...

3089
02:24:48,600 --> 02:24:49,260
Are you...

3090
02:24:49,260 --> 02:24:50,600
Tell me, are you...

3091
02:24:50,600 --> 02:24:52,080
I have no idea anyway, are you...

3092
02:24:53,080 --> 02:24:54,160
Are you a Kira follower?

3093
02:24:54,360 --> 02:24:54,880
Are you a follower?

3094
02:24:55,880 --> 02:24:57,020
Are you a follower?

3095
02:24:57,160 --> 02:24:57,520
Are you Kira?

3096
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:00,660
Are you Kira?

3097
02:25:01,740 --> 02:25:04,560
There's nobody here, there's nobody here but you and me.

3098
02:25:07,400 --> 02:25:10,020
Just bring out your... I promise, bring out your notebook.

3099
02:25:10,180 --> 02:25:12,100
I won't tell, I promise, I won't tell.

3100
02:25:12,280 --> 02:25:12,880
Kira to Kira.

3101
02:25:13,480 --> 02:25:14,560
Kira to Kira!

3102
02:25:14,840 --> 02:25:17,780
Bring your notebook out right now!

3103
02:25:23,260 --> 02:25:25,400
God is really on my side.

3104
02:25:25,400 --> 02:25:27,060
Oh shit, oh...

3105
02:25:27,060 --> 02:25:28,440
Oh fuck, I'm okay!

3106
02:25:29,340 --> 02:25:31,240
I'm okay, I lived!

3107
02:25:35,220 --> 02:25:36,380
We got...

3108
02:25:36,380 --> 02:25:39,940
We got hit by a car, but we're okay, we're okay.

3109
02:25:41,620 --> 02:25:42,900
Yeah, we were shoved in.

3110
02:25:42,900 --> 02:25:45,140
It happened to me in the tutorial, yeah.

3111
02:25:48,630 --> 02:25:51,160
Okay, three people resolving, where is everybody else?

3112
02:25:52,480 --> 02:25:55,660
Oh, that means one of us is not resolving the other thing.

3113
02:25:55,660 --> 02:25:56,180
I was resolving.

3114
02:25:56,680 --> 02:25:58,380
Oh, someone is not...

3115
02:25:58,380 --> 02:25:59,800
We're resolving, we're resolving.

3116
02:26:01,100 --> 02:26:03,420
No, it just pushes you.

3117
02:26:04,340 --> 02:26:07,620
It prevents the new god from... like the new world order.

3118
02:26:09,080 --> 02:26:11,240
Who just said I'm Kira?

3119
02:26:11,240 --> 02:26:12,660
Who was that?

3120
02:26:14,120 --> 02:26:16,540
Somebody in the file said I'm Kira.

3121
02:26:16,860 --> 02:26:18,180
Oh shit, I'm alive!

3122
02:26:19,420 --> 02:26:20,120
I'm alive!

3123
02:26:21,340 --> 02:26:23,260
No, I wasn't, what the fuck?

3124
02:26:23,320 --> 02:26:24,160
I was investigating.

3125
02:26:25,820 --> 02:26:27,880
No, no, no, I would never.

3126
02:26:28,360 --> 02:26:29,880
I mean, I'm literally wearing a shirt.

3127
02:26:30,120 --> 02:26:31,320
Yeah, typical Kira.

3128
02:26:32,100 --> 02:26:34,300
Typical Kira, thinking it's me.

3129
02:26:37,560 --> 02:26:38,820
Oh, who could be Kira?

3130
02:26:39,020 --> 02:26:39,440
Wait.

3131
02:26:41,240 --> 02:26:42,480
Wait, what?

3132
02:26:48,660 --> 02:26:49,620
Wait.

3133
02:26:53,100 --> 02:26:54,720
Wait, what was that?

3134
02:26:56,340 --> 02:26:56,960
Juniper?

3135
02:27:06,070 --> 02:27:07,030
Juniper?

3136
02:27:09,030 --> 02:27:10,950
I think...

3137
02:27:12,310 --> 02:27:14,130
That's weird.

3138
02:27:15,830 --> 02:27:17,710
Okay, where the fuck are the other cameras?

3139
02:27:22,090 --> 02:27:23,810
What was that?

3140
02:27:24,210 --> 02:27:24,490
Oh.

3141
02:27:31,560 --> 02:27:32,620
Okay, nice.

3142
02:27:32,740 --> 02:27:34,900
Someone wrote something during...

3143
02:27:34,900 --> 02:27:35,620
Oh, no!

3144
02:27:36,540 --> 02:27:37,060
No!

3145
02:27:38,320 --> 02:27:39,080
No!

3146
02:27:42,420 --> 02:27:43,980
No, it wasn't Juniper!

3147
02:27:49,690 --> 02:27:51,010
Who was it?

3148
02:27:51,050 --> 02:27:51,390
No!

3149
02:27:51,390 --> 02:27:51,590
No!

3150
02:27:55,210 --> 02:27:56,110
No!

3151
02:28:01,730 --> 02:28:02,670
Who was it?

3152
02:28:03,950 --> 02:28:06,490
How do you... be angrily again?

3153
02:28:11,450 --> 02:28:14,470
I didn't find Amelie's final words.

3154
02:28:24,910 --> 02:28:25,390
What?

3155
02:28:27,130 --> 02:28:27,610
What?

3156
02:28:27,730 --> 02:28:29,010
I can't complete my investigation.

3157
02:28:29,570 --> 02:28:30,070
I don't even know.

3158
02:28:30,910 --> 02:28:31,550
What do you mean?

3159
02:28:31,630 --> 02:28:32,550
I wasn't close enough.

3160
02:28:32,790 --> 02:28:33,050
I did my...

3161
02:28:33,930 --> 02:28:34,710
Oh, wait.

3162
02:28:35,350 --> 02:28:37,490
Oh, wait.

3163
02:28:37,490 --> 02:28:37,930
Who was it?

3164
02:28:40,620 --> 02:28:41,680
It was Belle.

3165
02:28:43,280 --> 02:28:44,420
Wait, who was it?

3166
02:28:44,880 --> 02:28:45,900
Was it Belle?

3167
02:28:46,200 --> 02:28:47,960
Her internet might have gone out again.

3168
02:28:48,240 --> 02:28:49,040
It might have, yeah.

3169
02:28:50,040 --> 02:28:52,600
That was a really good game so far though.

3170
02:28:52,600 --> 02:28:54,500
I was eating that shit up.

3171
02:28:54,940 --> 02:28:57,020
That was drama.

3172
02:28:57,620 --> 02:28:59,440
That was like drama, oh my god.

3173
02:28:59,680 --> 02:29:01,420
So, who was the killer?

3174
02:29:01,420 --> 02:29:02,060
Yeah, who was it?

3175
02:29:02,360 --> 02:29:03,960
It was me and Limu.

3176
02:29:04,400 --> 02:29:05,480
Oh, Giga.

3177
02:29:06,240 --> 02:29:06,620
Giga!

3178
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:11,960
What happened?

3179
02:29:14,180 --> 02:29:14,540
What happened?

3180
02:29:17,500 --> 02:29:22,100
I went to tell Doki that I thought it was Giga and she got hit by the car in front of me.

3181
02:29:22,100 --> 02:29:22,620
No!

3182
02:29:28,520 --> 02:29:34,720
I feel so bad.

3183
02:29:37,380 --> 02:29:42,560
Oh, if they found DC, I wouldn't use the bathroom.

3184
02:29:44,820 --> 02:29:45,980
What happened?

3185
02:29:46,120 --> 02:29:47,000
Wait, who was Akira?

3186
02:29:47,300 --> 02:29:47,860
Who was Akira?

3187
02:29:48,520 --> 02:29:50,020
It was me and Limu.

3188
02:29:50,960 --> 02:29:51,600
Oh...

3189
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:55,360
Okay, I didn't know you, but...

3190
02:29:55,360 --> 02:29:59,080
I knew it was Limu because she was alive.

3191
02:29:59,500 --> 02:30:00,200
She was alive.

3192
02:30:01,160 --> 02:30:04,080
She was like, do you think everybody is being a little too accusatory?

3193
02:30:06,520 --> 02:30:07,160
Like,

3194
02:30:11,460 --> 02:30:12,760
yeah, I trust you.

3195
02:30:14,280 --> 02:30:15,520
First mistake.

3196
02:30:16,300 --> 02:30:17,560
First mistake.

3197
02:30:17,560 --> 02:30:17,720
First mistake.

3198
02:30:20,080 --> 02:30:23,180
If Limu lives past first round, we know.

3199
02:30:27,080 --> 02:30:28,200
Alright, starting.

3200
02:30:29,280 --> 02:30:29,940
Let's go.

3201
02:30:34,360 --> 02:30:36,660
Oh my god, when can I be L?

3202
02:30:40,520 --> 02:30:42,240
When can I be L?

3203
02:30:42,300 --> 02:30:43,620
I wanna be L.

3204
02:30:44,500 --> 02:30:47,080
I wanna be a cool... Oh my god.

3205
02:30:47,440 --> 02:30:48,360
I wanna be L.

3206
02:30:51,740 --> 02:30:52,220
I trust you.

3207
02:30:52,900 --> 02:30:54,040
I trust you.

3208
02:30:54,760 --> 02:30:58,980
If something happens, I know where... Oh, you can't cancel the take ID, by the way.

3209
02:31:02,800 --> 02:31:04,180
No, that's not true.

3210
02:31:04,920 --> 02:31:05,520
That's not true.

3211
02:31:05,620 --> 02:31:06,020
Woah!

3212
02:31:06,140 --> 02:31:07,440
Okay, I don't trust you.

3213
02:31:07,600 --> 02:31:10,340
I don't want... I don't trust you, too.

3214
02:31:12,440 --> 02:31:14,020
Oh, woah, woah, woah.

3215
02:31:14,100 --> 02:31:14,920
My ID is gone.

3216
02:31:14,980 --> 02:31:15,720
I know what happened.

3217
02:31:18,660 --> 02:31:20,800
I don't trust all of you.

3218
02:31:20,800 --> 02:31:22,560
I have one person to trust.

3219
02:31:22,700 --> 02:31:22,960
Okay.

3220
02:31:24,220 --> 02:31:25,300
Woah, woah, woah.

3221
02:31:30,480 --> 02:31:32,540
Why did Bao get near me?

3222
02:31:38,620 --> 02:31:40,720
Alright guys, if I die, we know why.

3223
02:31:41,180 --> 02:31:44,420
If I die, we know what happened.

3224
02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:45,360
No, don't get near me!

3225
02:31:45,400 --> 02:31:45,880
Don't get near me!

3226
02:31:45,880 --> 02:31:46,640
I'm protecting documents!

3227
02:31:50,840 --> 02:31:51,980
Don't get near me!

3228
02:31:52,120 --> 02:31:53,260
I need to protect these papers!

3229
02:31:56,420 --> 02:32:00,320
Okay, I have three people that I'm a little suspicious now.

3230
02:32:00,840 --> 02:32:04,660
I feel like... Okay, if my ID is gone, then it's...

3231
02:32:04,660 --> 02:32:07,160
It has to be... Oh, okay.

3232
02:32:07,520 --> 02:32:10,120
Everybody uses a transmitter, so...

3233
02:32:10,120 --> 02:32:11,920
It has to be these three.

3234
02:32:12,380 --> 02:32:13,240
My ID is gone.

3235
02:32:16,040 --> 02:32:16,760
Communicating evidence?

3236
02:32:17,240 --> 02:32:19,400
Oh my god, I need them to know I'm okay.

3237
02:32:22,120 --> 02:32:23,280
I need them to know!

3238
02:32:23,360 --> 02:32:24,000
I need them to know!

3239
02:32:24,060 --> 02:32:24,760
No, no, no!

3240
02:32:25,560 --> 02:32:26,240
It's me!

3241
02:32:26,400 --> 02:32:26,640
Me!

3242
02:32:26,820 --> 02:32:27,000
No!

3243
02:32:28,380 --> 02:32:29,780
I wanted to be innocent!

3244
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:33,680
Okay, Juniper is innocent.

3245
02:32:40,820 --> 02:32:42,540
Juniper, all I'm saying is that it can't be me.

3246
02:32:42,540 --> 02:32:44,200
Juniper, it can't be me.

3247
02:32:45,700 --> 02:32:46,960
It can't be me.

3248
02:32:47,900 --> 02:32:49,140
Yeah, what are the odds?

3249
02:32:49,280 --> 02:32:50,020
It can't be me.

3250
02:32:50,180 --> 02:32:52,880
But I am a little suspicious of other people, though.

3251
02:32:54,820 --> 02:32:57,260
Let's hold hands, because it's not me.

3252
02:33:07,160 --> 02:33:11,100
Just put all of them suspicious, and then you just start marking people who you think it's not.

3253
02:33:13,360 --> 02:33:15,920
Oh my god, we did so much.

3254
02:33:17,400 --> 02:33:19,080
Did Kira do anything?

3255
02:33:20,720 --> 02:33:23,200
Oh, Kira was a little confused.

3256
02:33:27,540 --> 02:33:28,780
It's okay.

3257
02:33:36,300 --> 02:33:38,040
It's not me!

3258
02:33:39,780 --> 02:33:43,960
Yeah, if I was Kira, I would've killed people.

3259
02:33:51,820 --> 02:33:55,200
Yeah, but you could've recited an innocent person's line.

3260
02:33:55,420 --> 02:33:55,780
Yeah.

3261
02:33:57,580 --> 02:33:58,160
Yeah.

3262
02:33:58,160 --> 02:33:58,740
Yeah.

3263
02:34:05,340 --> 02:34:08,540
I was with you in the beginning of one of the rounds, and you didn't say it.

3264
02:34:08,700 --> 02:34:10,980
You didn't say it when I was with you last time.

3265
02:34:14,060 --> 02:34:14,640
Like what?

3266
02:34:14,760 --> 02:34:15,480
I would never.

3267
02:34:15,700 --> 02:34:16,700
I would never.

3268
02:34:21,640 --> 02:34:24,300
Yeah, in my journal, in my investigation notepad.

3269
02:34:24,640 --> 02:34:27,000
I have an investigation notepad like all of you guys.

3270
02:34:28,160 --> 02:34:31,180
This is a lot of accusations for literally nothing happening.

3271
02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:32,020
I'm just going to say that.

3272
02:34:32,180 --> 02:34:32,660
Yeah, I'm going to skip.

3273
02:34:35,900 --> 02:34:36,260
Oh!

3274
02:34:36,260 --> 02:34:37,060
Yeah, I just...

3275
02:34:37,060 --> 02:34:38,480
Oh!

3276
02:34:51,940 --> 02:34:52,780
Yeah,

3277
02:34:58,240 --> 02:34:59,140
I was... yeah.

3278
02:35:03,340 --> 02:35:04,920
Juniper's ID...

3279
02:35:06,260 --> 02:35:08,980
I can't go off of IDs because I'm usually touching like 8 people.

3280
02:35:09,120 --> 02:35:14,080
Whoever is checked on your investigation pad as like an exclamation point is somebody you were that close to.

3281
02:35:14,220 --> 02:35:16,000
And it's usually like 5 out of 8 people.

3282
02:35:16,560 --> 02:35:17,180
Right, right.

3283
02:35:21,520 --> 02:35:23,960
I still have my ID and I was next to Juniper.

3284
02:35:24,180 --> 02:35:26,280
And Juniper still has her ID, so we're fine.

3285
02:35:27,880 --> 02:35:29,360
Yeah, we were next to each other.

3286
02:35:30,220 --> 02:35:30,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3287
02:35:32,400 --> 02:35:32,720
See?

3288
02:35:32,980 --> 02:35:34,060
I didn't take your ID.

3289
02:35:34,280 --> 02:35:35,220
I told you.

3290
02:35:38,400 --> 02:35:39,840
Oh yeah, you like it?

3291
02:35:41,700 --> 02:35:42,720
Yeah, I like it.

3292
02:35:42,820 --> 02:35:44,580
I can keep being sick for you.

3293
02:35:47,680 --> 02:35:48,120
Woah!

3294
02:35:49,800 --> 02:35:51,380
Woah, get away, get away!

3295
02:35:53,200 --> 02:35:55,380
Oh, you guys are awfully close to each other.

3296
02:35:58,320 --> 02:35:59,440
Oh, I'm heading over.

3297
02:35:59,520 --> 02:36:02,520
I'm heading over to the furthest one.

3298
02:36:06,420 --> 02:36:07,980
Don't worry, I got you.

3299
02:36:12,140 --> 02:36:13,820
I'm literally resolving right now.

3300
02:36:13,880 --> 02:36:14,920
I literally just got here.

3301
02:36:16,340 --> 02:36:17,620
No, it's just me.

3302
02:36:18,640 --> 02:36:22,700
No, there's only two people resolving, so Giga, why aren't you resolving?

3303
02:36:23,840 --> 02:36:25,020
Press it, Giga!

3304
02:36:25,240 --> 02:36:25,800
Press it!

3305
02:36:27,380 --> 02:36:28,180
No, you weren't.

3306
02:36:28,360 --> 02:36:29,040
No, you weren't.

3307
02:36:29,340 --> 02:36:30,420
I didn't see it.

3308
02:36:31,060 --> 02:36:33,480
Alright, now I know if my ID is gone, now I know.

3309
02:36:34,340 --> 02:36:35,860
I'm taking notes right now.

3310
02:36:36,600 --> 02:36:40,060
Yeah, I think it might be Giga right there.

3311
02:36:40,660 --> 02:36:42,680
Wait, someone who's in the classroom.

3312
02:36:45,140 --> 02:36:45,980
Wait.

3313
02:36:48,120 --> 02:36:48,960
The restroom?

3314
02:36:51,440 --> 02:36:52,820
Where's the restroom?

3315
02:36:57,310 --> 02:37:00,050
I'm trying my best, Elle!

3316
02:37:01,830 --> 02:37:02,890
Where's the restroom?

3317
02:37:06,410 --> 02:37:08,650
I don't know where the bathroom is!

3318
02:37:11,150 --> 02:37:12,310
Where's the bathroom?

3319
02:37:16,090 --> 02:37:16,930
Top left?

3320
02:37:17,010 --> 02:37:17,410
Top left?

3321
02:37:17,490 --> 02:37:17,710
Okay.

3322
02:37:18,250 --> 02:37:18,790
Don't worry.

3323
02:37:24,290 --> 02:37:25,850
Why didn't you...

3324
02:37:25,850 --> 02:37:26,130
Bow.

3325
02:37:27,930 --> 02:37:29,230
Why didn't you... Bow.

3326
02:37:29,990 --> 02:37:30,510
Bow.

3327
02:37:31,070 --> 02:37:31,070
Bow.

3328
02:37:31,190 --> 02:37:31,410
Bow.

3329
02:37:31,430 --> 02:37:32,210
Why didn't you...

3330
02:37:32,750 --> 02:37:32,930
Bow.

3331
02:37:33,010 --> 02:37:34,130
Why didn't you... Bow.

3332
02:37:34,130 --> 02:37:34,130
Bow.

3333
02:37:34,150 --> 02:37:34,190
Bow.

3334
02:37:37,770 --> 02:37:38,370
Okay.

3335
02:37:39,330 --> 02:37:39,930
Alright.

3336
02:37:40,770 --> 02:37:41,110
Alright.

3337
02:37:42,210 --> 02:37:45,270
The last person she was with was you, Bow.

3338
02:37:53,550 --> 02:37:55,290
Yeah, but you could be a follower.

3339
02:37:59,310 --> 02:38:01,390
You were going through some stuff.

3340
02:38:01,550 --> 02:38:02,410
You were like...

3341
02:38:02,410 --> 02:38:02,750
Oh!

3342
02:38:04,170 --> 02:38:05,790
How is she here?

3343
02:38:06,870 --> 02:38:08,930
Put your notebook out right now.

3344
02:38:09,070 --> 02:38:10,770
You can put your notebook out right now.

3345
02:38:11,250 --> 02:38:12,930
Put your notebook out right now.

3346
02:38:15,550 --> 02:38:16,650
It's over, dude.

3347
02:38:17,230 --> 02:38:18,090
It's so over.

3348
02:38:20,410 --> 02:38:21,490
Oh my God.

3349
02:38:21,550 --> 02:38:22,030
A heart?

3350
02:38:22,550 --> 02:38:22,790
Oh!

3351
02:38:22,990 --> 02:38:23,370
Goodbye.

3352
02:38:24,930 --> 02:38:26,590
Another heart attack.

3353
02:38:29,550 --> 02:38:31,110
Oh, Juniper died too.

3354
02:38:32,570 --> 02:38:34,270
She was just... She was just innocent!

3355
02:38:36,810 --> 02:38:39,570
You should protect the people who get labeled as such.

3356
02:38:39,670 --> 02:38:40,750
They're obviously gonna be targeted.

3357
02:38:41,870 --> 02:38:42,750
Guys, I think...

3358
02:38:42,750 --> 02:38:45,930
I think Bow could either be a follower... I think it's Bow.

3359
02:38:46,370 --> 02:38:48,670
I... I... I think it's...

3360
02:38:48,670 --> 02:38:50,150
Oh yeah, why am I dead?

3361
02:38:50,370 --> 02:38:51,970
Why were you just... You were like...

3362
02:38:52,530 --> 02:38:53,730
Hmm, look at these...

3363
02:38:55,650 --> 02:38:58,690
Bow was looking through this person's documents?

3364
02:39:05,790 --> 02:39:07,810
Because you could be the follower.

3365
02:39:09,590 --> 02:39:11,490
You could be a follower.

3366
02:39:11,710 --> 02:39:12,930
You could be a sheep.

3367
02:39:14,510 --> 02:39:18,950
Her last message was that also my ID has been stolen, but...

3368
02:39:18,950 --> 02:39:21,610
I wrote down who was close to me.

3369
02:39:23,150 --> 02:39:23,670
And...

3370
02:39:23,670 --> 02:39:26,710
Bow, Mint, and Giga were close to me.

3371
02:39:26,710 --> 02:39:31,690
Hey, hey, my ID got stolen and the only one I went close enough to this round was Giga.

3372
02:39:31,850 --> 02:39:33,170
Because I gave her a thing.

3373
02:39:33,830 --> 02:39:34,130
Oh!

3374
02:39:34,790 --> 02:39:34,930
She gave me a present.

3375
02:39:35,190 --> 02:39:35,950
She gave me a gift.

3376
02:39:36,670 --> 02:39:37,950
Alright, Giga, defend yourself.

3377
02:39:38,310 --> 02:39:41,370
I gave you a gift, but my ID got stolen and nobody else has been close enough to me.

3378
02:39:41,370 --> 02:39:41,730
Yeah.

3379
02:39:42,370 --> 02:39:45,110
Bow, why don't you defend your Kira, Bow?

3380
02:39:45,470 --> 02:39:47,190
Bow, do you think it's Giga, Bow?

3381
02:39:48,350 --> 02:39:50,290
I think Snuffy's the follower, baby.

3382
02:39:50,510 --> 02:39:50,910
Sorry, Snuffy.

3383
02:39:50,910 --> 02:39:53,950
I think the only person I trust is Snuffy.

3384
02:39:58,370 --> 02:40:00,930
I know Amelie's dying message was Bow.

3385
02:40:01,170 --> 02:40:03,610
Giga might not actually be...

3386
02:40:03,610 --> 02:40:09,950
Yeah, Giga might not actually be Kira because I also saw a witness say that an ID got, like, handed off.

3387
02:40:10,550 --> 02:40:13,890
But I think Giga's involved either way.

3388
02:40:13,970 --> 02:40:15,930
But also, Giga didn't help us with the body.

3389
02:40:17,070 --> 02:40:17,690
That's true.

3390
02:40:18,090 --> 02:40:18,850
Oh my God.

3391
02:40:19,870 --> 02:40:20,670
That's true.

3392
02:40:21,350 --> 02:40:24,870
And Giga was honest while we were doing the body together.

3393
02:40:25,670 --> 02:40:30,890
I didn't click on it, because every time we stack up, like, everyone's ID gets stolen, so I've been stepping back.

3394
02:40:31,450 --> 02:40:32,990
Yeah, I've been using, like, one or two to do it.

3395
02:40:33,770 --> 02:40:35,390
Yeah, but my ID's gone.

3396
02:40:35,510 --> 02:40:37,790
That was the only time I was super close to people.

3397
02:40:38,590 --> 02:40:39,410
That's pretty suspect.

3398
02:40:40,290 --> 02:40:42,590
Yeah, that's the only time I'm really scared of physical touch.

3399
02:40:42,590 --> 02:40:42,770
Bye.

3400
02:40:50,870 --> 02:40:53,110
I mean, I think it's enough votes already.

3401
02:40:53,290 --> 02:40:56,410
I don't think you need to overcook.

3402
02:40:56,570 --> 02:40:58,870
With two people dead, we should vote anyway.

3403
02:40:59,250 --> 02:40:59,550
Yeah.

3404
02:40:59,850 --> 02:41:00,110
True.

3405
02:41:00,370 --> 02:41:00,610
True.

3406
02:41:02,510 --> 02:41:05,850
What does it mean to, like, does it matter who we pick to confiscate items?

3407
02:41:06,110 --> 02:41:07,730
Yes, it does, because if you pick...

3408
02:41:07,730 --> 02:41:08,830
They can get them back.

3409
02:41:09,290 --> 02:41:12,030
Yeah, if you pick a Kira follower, they can get it back, basically.

3410
02:41:12,590 --> 02:41:14,130
Wait, then why did you pick Bao?

3411
02:41:17,470 --> 02:41:19,390
What if Bao is a follower?

3412
02:41:20,650 --> 02:41:21,190
I'm not!

3413
02:41:26,650 --> 02:41:29,550
I just dropped... Who is the follower?

3414
02:41:30,270 --> 02:41:31,190
Very interesting.

3415
02:41:35,590 --> 02:41:36,890
We did it.

3416
02:41:37,350 --> 02:41:39,090
I actually wasn't Kira originally.

3417
02:41:39,230 --> 02:41:42,470
I was the follower, and then, like, right before the round ended...

3418
02:41:42,470 --> 02:41:45,570
I was so scared of it.

3419
02:41:46,110 --> 02:41:49,570
I literally killed somebody right before Limeu saw me, and so I thought...

3420
02:41:49,570 --> 02:41:56,650
Like, Doki saw me so easily one time, so I thought Limeu would've just instantly seen me and been like, Oh, shit, I just saw her kill somebody, so I was like, uh, you can take this.

3421
02:41:57,990 --> 02:41:59,810
You are so suspicious.

3422
02:42:00,310 --> 02:42:00,630
That's so funny!

3423
02:42:03,770 --> 02:42:05,310
That's no good.

3424
02:42:07,630 --> 02:42:10,110
I can't believe it wasn't you, Bao.

3425
02:42:10,250 --> 02:42:11,070
I'm so sorry.

3426
02:42:11,070 --> 02:42:15,310
I can't believe it wasn't her.

3427
02:42:19,370 --> 02:42:20,250
Wait,

3428
02:42:24,810 --> 02:42:25,610
Bao, you were L?

3429
02:42:27,670 --> 02:42:29,530
You were L?

3430
02:42:31,310 --> 02:42:34,170
Oh my God, wait.

3431
02:42:36,130 --> 02:42:38,150
That's LG, LG.

3432
02:42:39,930 --> 02:42:41,390
That was fun!

3433
02:42:45,370 --> 02:42:46,770
Thank you, everybody!

3434
02:42:47,570 --> 02:42:48,530
Thank you all for coming!

3435
02:42:48,750 --> 02:42:51,070
You guys had fun playing Death Note!

3436
02:42:53,530 --> 02:42:54,570
GG's, everybody!

3437
02:42:54,730 --> 02:42:54,950
GG!

3438
02:42:57,290 --> 02:42:58,130
Bye-bye!

3439
02:43:01,910 --> 02:43:04,230
I like that this game has in-voice chat.

3440
02:43:04,470 --> 02:43:05,610
It helps a lot.

3441
02:43:08,150 --> 02:43:10,870
I want to do things where I can just make the game all about me.

3442
02:43:11,750 --> 02:43:13,230
No, sorry, I'm not gonna do that again.

3443
02:43:15,270 --> 02:43:16,510
You were so good.

3444
02:43:16,750 --> 02:43:18,430
You were a natural detective.

3445
02:43:18,990 --> 02:43:20,030
Oh, thank you!

3446
02:43:20,490 --> 02:43:21,970
I want to get L sometime.

3447
02:43:22,110 --> 02:43:22,870
That was really fun.

3448
02:43:23,250 --> 02:43:23,430
Me too!

3449
02:43:23,550 --> 02:43:25,110
Yeah, I want to get L, too.

3450
02:43:25,250 --> 02:43:26,630
I want to know what that was like.

3451
02:43:27,010 --> 02:43:27,490
Yeah, yeah.

3452
02:43:27,670 --> 02:43:28,670
Okay, thank you, guys.

3453
02:43:28,770 --> 02:43:29,510
Yeah, GG's!

3454
02:43:29,810 --> 02:43:30,210
GG's!

3455
02:43:30,310 --> 02:43:31,750
Bye-bye, Snuffy!

3456
02:43:32,310 --> 02:43:33,050
Bye, Mint!

3457
02:43:33,970 --> 02:43:35,490
I'm destroying the room now.

3458
02:43:38,150 --> 02:43:38,810
Oh, yeah!

3459
02:43:39,330 --> 02:43:40,350
That was really fun.

3460
02:43:40,530 --> 02:43:43,890
I'm glad we tried out this game on launch day.

3461
02:43:44,090 --> 02:43:47,070
Obviously, there's a lot of stuff that they can improve on.

3462
02:43:47,390 --> 02:43:49,950
Like, because it just got launched.

3463
02:43:50,330 --> 02:43:54,410
So, obviously, there's so many small things they could do to make it...

3464
02:43:55,090 --> 02:43:58,270
to make it a bit more interesting and stuff.

3465
02:43:58,410 --> 02:44:02,850
But I do enjoy the premise for a game that launched out of nowhere.

3466
02:44:03,230 --> 02:44:04,630
With no warning.

3467
02:44:06,190 --> 02:44:11,510
I think, like, the more you play it, the more you can, like, you know, trick people.

3468
02:44:11,810 --> 02:44:14,850
And the more intricate you can be with the whole setting.

3469
02:44:16,010 --> 02:44:18,930
But there's definitely a lot of potential for, like, Death Note SD.

3470
02:44:19,070 --> 02:44:20,930
I love, like, I love the cosmetics.

3471
02:44:21,950 --> 02:44:27,190
I love the cosmetics and, like, the different stuff you can do with, like, the names and stuff.

3472
02:44:27,270 --> 02:44:28,770
And the in-game...

3473
02:44:28,770 --> 02:44:31,230
I think the in-game voice chat was really nice.

3474
02:44:31,370 --> 02:44:32,630
I think they just need to fix the...

3475
02:44:33,190 --> 02:44:36,130
They definitely needed to fix the in-game VC a bit more.

3476
02:44:36,370 --> 02:44:37,470
Because it was a little finicky.

3477
02:44:37,790 --> 02:44:39,110
But I had a great time!

3478
02:44:39,330 --> 02:44:40,290
We had a great time.

3479
02:44:40,870 --> 02:44:42,970
I hope that you guys enjoyed watching.

3480
02:44:43,210 --> 02:44:44,950
It was very hard organizing this collab.

3481
02:44:45,470 --> 02:44:48,130
Because it was, like, you know, the game came out, like...

3482
02:44:48,130 --> 02:44:52,550
The news for this game came out super last minute.

3483
02:44:53,270 --> 02:44:55,310
And, like, I was like, oh my god, wait.

3484
02:44:56,930 --> 02:44:59,010
Time to fucking grab people!

3485
02:44:59,010 --> 02:45:03,330
I messaged so many different people to see if they were, like, free and stuff.

3486
02:45:03,410 --> 02:45:10,610
So it was, like, just scrambling around trying to grab people to play the game on launch.

3487
02:45:10,730 --> 02:45:10,910
Yeah.

3488
02:45:12,470 --> 02:45:13,710
And I had a great time.

3489
02:45:13,830 --> 02:45:14,370
It was great.

3490
02:45:14,670 --> 02:45:15,130
Hey, guys.

3491
02:45:15,250 --> 02:45:16,590
I am going to call it here.

3492
02:45:16,670 --> 02:45:17,470
I've been coughing a lot.

3493
02:45:17,530 --> 02:45:18,930
So I'm going to rest my voice now.

3494
02:45:19,190 --> 02:45:22,150
I had a very long day with dance classes, Apex, then collab.

3495
02:45:22,430 --> 02:45:23,790
So I'm going to rest up here.

3496
02:45:24,130 --> 02:45:25,390
Thank you, everybody, for coming.

3497
02:45:25,670 --> 02:45:26,790
I really do appreciate it.

3498
02:45:26,810 --> 02:45:28,070
I hope you guys had a fun time watching.

3499
02:45:28,070 --> 02:45:29,970
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

3500
02:45:30,190 --> 02:45:30,670
Posture check.

3501
02:45:30,770 --> 02:45:32,490
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3502
02:45:32,790 --> 02:45:34,750
And if you didn't stay up for me, head to bed.

3503
02:45:34,910 --> 02:45:36,090
Because you deserve it.

3504
02:45:36,170 --> 02:45:37,730
I'm going to buy some cough drops after this.

3505
02:45:37,970 --> 02:45:38,470
Hey, guys.

3506
02:45:38,850 --> 02:45:39,610
Bye, everybody.

3507
02:45:40,110 --> 02:45:40,510
Bye!
