1
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,460
Hello, everybody!

2
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,480
Hello, hello!

3
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,180
I was, the past two days, working.

4
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:15,820
Yes, although it says rest day or until the next heist, I'm still working.

5
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,980
There's no stopping with the work.

6
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,080
Oh my god, there's so much behind the scenes stuff to do.

7
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:34,060
Oh yeah, because I'm the boss now, I can talk about this stuff without having to worry about like, can I talk about this?

8
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,080
I'm the boss!

9
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,820
I say I can talk about this!

10
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,620
So like, one of the things that I was very stressed out about, by the way...

11
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,960
Oh my god, opening a store and running a store.

12
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,080
Running a store is so hard.

13
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,060
Oh my gosh.

14
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,900
Because there's a lot of things that can happen.

15
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,700
Because we're all starting out, my team is just starting out.

16
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,760
I'm just starting out running a John-ass store.

17
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,580
Like, you know, the best I have done was Etsy and Artist Alley.

18
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,400
So like, you said rest day!

19
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,900
Well, I didn't say who's gonna be resting.

20
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:17,780
What?

21
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,120
I'm not lying that you're the one that's resting, not me!

22
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:28,440
The thing about being a streamer is that technically there's no actual rest days when you're a streamer.

23
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,080
Because you're always working.

24
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:40,060
Like, you give yourself the rest day because your whole job is to stream and to like keep up your platform, your social platform and all that fucking shit.

25
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:45,460
If I was... that's why I'm playing Supermarket Simulator so I can be like, I can be a real person.

26
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,520
You know.

27
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:57,680
It's not like I'm working at a supermarket where I just... where I just check in, do my hours and then check out and not have to worry about the supermarket anymore.

28
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:07,870
Instead, as a streamer, we always have to worry about everything.

29
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,270
Stream ends!

30
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,290
You think we stop working?

31
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,110
Well, like for some people, maybe.

32
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,670
But for me, I'm still working.

33
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:23,310
Because I have to like, make sure that I, you know, make sure that I still have an income coming in.

34
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,630
Yeah, I might make rest day for Amber.

35
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:30,570
You don't know that.

36
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,350
Anyway.

37
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,670
Um.

38
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,390
Thank you, thank you for the super chat.

39
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,150
Thank you, thank you.

40
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,630
Also, welcome to the tomato farm.

41
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,150
Welcome, welcome.

42
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,310
Okay, anyway.

43
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,030
Where was I?

44
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:39,910
Okay, yes.

45
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:40,730
Anyway.

46
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,470
Running a store is incredibly difficult.

47
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,490
It is such a huge learning process.

48
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:56,830
Especially opening up the store to more and more, uh, to more and more like people from different countries.

49
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,390
So, one of the biggest issue, like mistake I found out yesterday.

50
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:10,930
Um, I was like looking through like, uh, cause like finally I had time to look through like the orders and the, um, the payments and stuff like that.

51
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:11,950
And the analytics.

52
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,730
So, I was looking at the store analytics yesterday.

53
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:15,990
And then I noticed.

54
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,830
I was like, this only applied to the Lunar New Year merch, by the way.

55
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,770
So, like do not worry about like, oh my gosh, Tokyo, what about your other merch?

56
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,830
Are you okay with the other merch?

57
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,990
So, this only applied to the Lunar...

58
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,070
Yeah, this is the pain of being self-employed.

59
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,710
The Lunar New Year merch.

60
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:30,770
So, I was looking.

61
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:31,790
And I was like, oh, okay.

62
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,870
Someone ordered the Lunar New Year Recall X stand.

63
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,330
So, then I was like, alright.

64
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:36,730
Okay.

65
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:37,470
And then I looked at it.

66
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,210
And I realized, wait a minute.

67
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,050
Why is the stand $3 shipping?

68
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,490
I was like, that's for stickers.

69
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:45,970
And then I was like, oh, okay.

70
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:53,910
I realized almost everybody that ordered individual Lunar New Year stands were paying $3 for shipping.

71
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,970
So, I was like freaking out.

72
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,610
Because I was like, okay.

73
00:06:58,570 --> 00:06:59,850
Shipping is not $3.

74
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,190
I might be trying to make shipping cheaper.

75
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,510
But it's definitely not $3.

76
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,010
So, then I was like, oh my gosh.

77
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,610
What the fuck happened?

78
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,190
So, there was like a mistake.

79
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,950
And somehow only the Lunar New Year acrylic stand was there.

80
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,090
And the stand got affected by this.

81
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,470
Thankfully, it's changed now.

82
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,150
It's changed.

83
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,050
It was changed yesterday night when we caught it.

84
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:30,210
But like, I'm taking the loss because obviously like we're all still starting out.

85
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,710
And everything.

86
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,490
And so, like I don't want to refund that.

87
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,450
Because it was like, the mistake was on our side.

88
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,570
And not on the customer's side.

89
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,830
So, like I was like, okay.

90
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,170
It wasn't that bad.

91
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:48,390
It was only like 50 people bought the stand.

92
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,290
So, I was like, I can tank 50 people.

93
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,730
Like, I can't even.

94
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:58,370
I was just like, it wasn't really a loss.

95
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,910
Like, there's still profits going on.

96
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,310
It's just people who individually ordered the stand.

97
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,050
Like, it's just that.

98
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,090
And I was like, it's alright.

99
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,530
It's like, it's just, it's fine.

100
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,690
Like, there's still a profit for it.

101
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,790
It's just...

102
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:13,410
Um...

103
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,370
You know, regarding that.

104
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,170
It's just like, they're still paying for that.

105
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,590
So, I was like, it's fine.

106
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,750
It's fine.

107
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,370
I'll just...

108
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,830
I can tank the cost for them.

109
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,270
Okay.

110
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:33,490
It's just the longer I do this, the more experience we're gonna get.

111
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,790
So, it's okay.

112
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,170
I'm happy to take the mistakes now.

113
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,730
Then later on.

114
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,130
Because I'll be like, okay.

115
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,470
If it was like...

116
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,690
Oh my god.

117
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,150
I'm so thankful for the 50 gift ships.

118
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,250
Thank you.

119
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:46,870
Thank you.

120
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,830
Masters, thank you for the 50 gift ships.

121
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:49,570
Thank you.

122
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,230
Thank you.

123
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,010
I really appreciate it.

124
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:59,210
But I was like, I'd rather we make these mistakes now than later down on the line when it will be a...

125
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:03,710
Like, if it was a thousand people, then we would have an issue.

126
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:04,890
But like, no.

127
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:09,930
Like, I'd rather just take it now than later on down the line.

128
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,090
So, we've learned.

129
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,670
Our team has learned.

130
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,810
We've learned as we go along.

131
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,650
Building more and more experience points.

132
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:19,510
So, yeah.

133
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,930
So, I was going through that.

134
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:22,750
But it's okay.

135
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,990
Like, we're not losing money.

136
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,810
In the end, even though that happened, we're not losing money.

137
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:29,330
So...

138
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:38,590
It's just that, like, regarding that, it's just not like as much profit versus the other...

139
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,590
If this shipping was like the right cost.

140
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,390
Like...

141
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,570
Like, it's just a couple of dollars.

142
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:46,750
Like, the shipping.

143
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:51,230
Because like, normally, the shipping would be like seven to eight dollars instead of three.

144
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,910
So, like, I was like, okay, that's fine.

145
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:56,370
That's fine.

146
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,950
Like, I'm willing to take that.

147
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,870
And it wasn't that big of an amount.

148
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:01,490
So...

149
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:03,350
Um...

150
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,750
Robin, thank you for the super chat.

151
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:05,090
Thank you.

152
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,650
Thank you.

153
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:05,850
Yeah.

154
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,570
I was like, it wasn't a thousand.

155
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,070
I'm okay.

156
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,110
It didn't even hit a hundred.

157
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,830
It only...

158
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:10,670
It was two digits.

159
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,210
It's fine.

160
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,450
So, I was doing...

161
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,490
I was handling...

162
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,610
I was handling...

163
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,270
Because I was like thinking, this is a learning experience for the team and I.

164
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,710
Handling a store is like one of the hardest.

165
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,410
I think like everything...

166
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:30,030
The store is definitely the hardest thing to deal...

167
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,590
To deal with.

168
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:34,430
Because like, obviously, there's like so many factors.

169
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,330
And then like also like the currency...

170
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:37,650
The...

171
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:38,490
Uh...

172
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:39,350
The...

173
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,230
Currency...

174
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,890
Like converting and everything.

175
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,430
Um...

176
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,790
And it's just...

177
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,450
Oh, my God, it is...

178
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,350
It's a lot.

179
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,550
It's a lot.

180
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:51,450
Yeah.

181
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,070
So, I hope that like...

182
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:55,890

185
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:01,470
Oh, my God.

186
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,390
And also like, I have a like...

187
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:07,310
I have a meeting with my accountant and then also like a meeting with my Canadian friends.

188
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:20,270
I'm a Canadian business lawyer for like regarding like drafting up contracts and stuff like we we are we're working on an NDA contract for like people we hire and everything.

189
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:24,830
And I was like, oh my god, I just I just want to stream funny games.

190
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:34,620
I just want to stream silly games like Supermarket Simulator.

191
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,500
Just want to be a funny anime girl.

192
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,820
Oh my god.

193
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,040
Yeah.

194
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:52,820
I was like, I need like my Mr. Matt and my mom was like, you need to have.

195
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:57,360
They're like, did you let this did you or any of the artists you hired in this side?

196
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,600
And he is I was like, No, I'm an indie like, no, Doki!

197
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:08,800
You need to have For your safety, we need to have these contracts ready.

198
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,880
I'm like, I'm trying guys.

199
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,700
I'm trying.

200
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,540
We need to protect yourselves.

201
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,420
I know.

202
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,720
I know.

203
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,710
I'm doing my best.

204
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,410
So yeah, anyway.

205
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:39,890
Anyway.

206
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:44,430
I was like dealing with a lot of the work stuff for that.

207
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:48,810
So, being my own boss is a lot.

208
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,610
It's definitely a lot of stuff going on.

209
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,970
There's been a lot of meetings I had to attend.

210
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,810
A lot of meetings I had to attend.

211
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:57,870
A lot of meetings I had to attend.

212
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:00,850
A lot of contracts I had to sign.

213
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,350
A lot of contracts I had to sign.

214
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,650
I was like, oh my god.

215
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:11,190
But I can also delegate my work too.

216
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,770
So I'm not doing everything myself.

217
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,030
I delegate it to other people.

218
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,910
So I'll be like, you do that.

219
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,330
And you do that.

220
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:23,710
So at best, I don't even have to attend that many meetings.

221
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:24,190
So at best, I don't even have to attend that many meetings.

222
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:29,710
Because my team is like, my team attends a lot of my meetings too.

223
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,490
And then they just like, tell me what's going on.

224
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,590
And I'm like, that's great.

225
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:37,030
I'm just like, thank fucking god.

226
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,550
Thank god.

227
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:39,590
Oh yeah!

228
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,390
Another little bit of announcement.

229
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,950
I got invited to do a...

230
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:47,550
a...

231
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,710
a...

232
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,650
I don't know when this is going to be.

233
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,330
It's not this week by the way.

234
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:55,190
But I got invited to do a JP Apex tournament.

235
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,430
I don't know when it...

236
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,570
I don't remember when it's going to be.

237
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,370
It's not this week.

238
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:01,550
That's not the special Apex stream by the way.

239
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:04,270
That's not the Apex special stream.

240
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,650
It's a different one.

241
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:11,250
So I'll be participating in a Japanese Apex tournament.

242
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,750
In the nearby future.

243
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,410
I don't remember what the date it is.

244
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,470
I should write stuff down.

245
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,250
I really should.

246
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,110
I should write stuff down more.

247
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,290
I'm going to be in the cloud with Amelie on Saturday.

248
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,530
I saw people were like, who is it going to be Doki?

249
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:30,450
Who are you going to play with?

250
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:31,110
The two other people.

251
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,790
I don't even know because we haven't asked anybody.

252
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,050
I was just like...

253
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,990
I put that down.

254
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,230
People think that I know.

255
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,290
It's like a surprise.

256
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:45,290
But like I put it down because we haven't asked who the two people are.

257
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,210
We haven't even asked people yet.

258
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,710
Because I was just like, I just want to put my schedule up.

259
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:53,110
I just want to put my schedule up.

260
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,450
So I was just like...

261
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,170
I was just like...

262
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:59,030
I just love how everyone was like, Oh my god, I wonder if it's these guys.

263
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,130
I was like, I don't know.

264
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:00,770
Me too.

265
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,930
I don't even know who they are going to be too.

266
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:03,950
Whoa!

267
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,570
It's a surprise for everyone.

268
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:11,910
Including me.

269
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,290
Alright, let's actually play Supermarket Simulator.

270
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:15,910
Let's go.

271
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,110
I was like reading the like what's upcoming.

272
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,650
And I love how cleaning is there.

273
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,030
And I was like, oh thank god I'm playing.

274
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:25,070
Thank god they haven't pushed out the cleaning update yet.

275
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,150
I really, really don't want to clean.

276
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,670
I really, really don't want to clean.

277
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,150
So I was like, oh thank god.

278
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:32,370
So I was like, oh thank god.

279
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:35,070
That's like one thing I'm glad it's not in there.

280
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:35,950
So, oh my god.

281
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,090
Shoplifters!

282
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,830
Security guards.

283
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:39,470
CCTV.

284
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:40,710
Oh my god.

285
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,210
This is going to be like too real.

286
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,770
Why work at your local supermarket?

287
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:48,530
Why work at your local supermarket?

288
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,010
Why work at your local supermarket?

289
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,350
Why you can play Supermarket Simulator?

290
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,690
Why you can play Supermarket Simulator?

291
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:53,930
You can play around.

292
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:54,970
Veggie and fruits.

293
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:57,670
Buying a house.

294
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:58,570
I don't need a house.

295
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,910
I can live in the supermarket.

296
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,550
The supermarket has everything I need.

297
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,990
Just like that MrBeast video.

298
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:08,590
Where like that couple lived in the supermarket for a fucking month or some shit.

299
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:09,150
Cas!

300
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,010
Thank you for the superchat.

301
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:10,770
Thank you, thank you.

302
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,990
Are you planning to create a code for Fortnite in the future?

303
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,910
My V-Bucks yearn to be spent.

304
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,190
Um, yes in the future.

305
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,570
There's like some stuff going on around that.

306
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,430
Because I'm trying to transfer.

307
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,670
Figure out a way to get my V-Bucks to be spent.

308
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:24,890
And I'm trying to transfer.

309
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,210
My skins to...

310
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:35,970
I'm just trying to figure out if there is any way.

311
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:45,090
To do that Because I spent around like almost 600 plus dollars on Fortnite skins.

312
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:48,610
Because I have a problem regarding Fortnite skins.

313
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:50,410
But.

314
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:58,910
I would say that whatever creative code you're using, it still works.

315
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:07,550
The money for that code still goes to me.

316
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,650
I'll just say that.

317
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,870
That's all I can say.

318
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,150
That's all I can say.

319
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:19,150
So until then, you can keep using whatever code you have.

320
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:19,770
I'm kidding.

321
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,570
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

322
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:24,950
Thank you.

323
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:25,490
Thank you.

324
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:27,410
Gotta get the Hey Peter skin.

325
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,430
Thank you for the super chat.

326
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:28,990
Thank you.

327
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:29,550
Thank you.

328
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,190
So like that's all I can say about that.

329
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:38,950
The reason why we don't have a new code yet is because I'm trying to get my fucking Fortnite skins back.

330
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:43,990
So the moment I can get my skins back, there will be a new code.

331
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:48,570
Because I don't give a fuck about anything else on that account.

332
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,730
I just want my fort...

333
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:55,630
I need you guys to know, like when I did have a job that day... time.

334
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:03,710
I bought more Fortnite skins as retail therapy and I had a John Cena skin on there.

335
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:08,330
And I swear to God, I need those skins back!

336
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:12,330
I spent so much money...

337
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,450
I need all those skins...

338
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:19,430
I spent so much money.

339
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,390
I bought so many.

340
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,510
I bought a lot.

341
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:31,930
I have a John Cena skin on there now.

342
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,930
I have the... what was it?

343
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:38,730
The perfect cell skin because I thought I would be funny with the basketball.

344
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,230
I need them.

345
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,290
I need them back.

346
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,850
Mr. Man is working on it.

347
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,970
Mr. Man said it's possible to get my skins back.

348
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,390
That's all I want.

349
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,090
Last order.

350
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,190
Thank you for the 10.

351
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:56,870
Give this shit.

352
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:57,350
Thank you.

353
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:57,990
Thank you.

354
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,070
Oh no, chat.

355
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,010
Thank you for the super chat.

356
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,310
Thank you.

357
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:00,610
Thank you.

358
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,330
John Cena skin is so OP.

359
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,970
Nobody can see you.

360
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,890
Let's play the actual supermarket.

361
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:08,950
Alright.

362
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,550
Welcome to the supermarket simulator.

363
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:15,030
You'll start with a small store and grow to an awesome supermarket.

364
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,590
I'm gonna be whole... what is it?

365
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,070
Whole Greens?

366
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:21,770
What is that super expensive like suburban mom supermarket?

367
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,030
I wanna be that.

368
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,390
I want...

369
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,850
Everything is like times three expensive.

370
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,130
Whole Foods!

371
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,450
I wanna be Whole Foods!

372
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,710
We're gonna be the better Whole Foods.

373
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:35,410
Start by purchasing goods to sell and place them onto shelves.

374
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,050
Don't forget to set prices to avoid a profit.

375
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,250
With profit to avoid bank... I can do that.

376
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,110
Oh my god.

377
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,390
That's... alright.

378
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:43,550
Let's turn now.

379
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,410
Let's do... oh, it's only hot.

380
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:45,750
Where's my...

381
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:48,130
This is my ultra ultra setting for this game.

382
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,650
Order using the computer.

383
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:51,690
Alright.

384
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:53,390
Okay.

385
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,010
Market.

386
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,730
We're gonna have cereal...

387
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,230
How much money do I have?

388
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,450
How much money?

389
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,470
Okay, we have $50.

390
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,350
Not a lot to start a supermarket.

391
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,490
Okay, we're not gonna have cereal.

392
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,150
Cereal is not... not a lot.

393
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,250
Not a lot of people that are awake in the...

394
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,170
No, actually!

395
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,770
We start with cereal.

396
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:15,750
Because the people who are awake this early... that need cereal.

397
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,910
Have money.

398
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:18,830
Actually, no.

399
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:19,270
They're students.

400
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:19,930
Never mind.

401
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,230
Fucking... No, moms!

402
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,170
Moms will buy!

403
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,810
Moms will need cereal for their children.

404
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,250
And we all know...

405
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,150
If the moms have kids...

406
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,810
Okay, usually...

407
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,950
Then they can afford good ass cereal.

408
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:33,510
Alright.

409
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,070
Okay, we're gonna have cereal.

410
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,910
Alright, and then... Everybody loves pasta.

411
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,610
Who doesn't love pasta?

412
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,210
Alright, cereal and pasta.

413
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,190
This is gonna be our store.

414
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,750
We're just... We're just gonna have cereal.

415
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,530
Cereal and pasta.

416
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:47,330
That's fine.

417
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,490
Moms need to cook too!

418
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,090
They need to cook!

419
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,210
Okay?

420
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,670
They need cereal and pasta.

421
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,790
Alright, how do I show?

422
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:58,970
Okay.

423
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,150
Alright, nice.

424
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,730
Here's my pasta.

425
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:03,530
There's my...

426
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,230
Is that cereal pasta?

427
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,890
There's my pasta.

428
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,370
And then...

429
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,810
Nexy, thank you for the super chat!

430
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:10,850
Thank you, thank you.

431
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,150
Can I get my... No!

432
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:13,590
Why?

433
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,190
Okay.

434
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,730
I'm not very good at this.

435
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,290
I'm not very good at shelving.

436
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,770
Okay, give me a sec.

437
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,270
I'm new here.

438
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,470
This is my store and I'm new here.

439
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,910
Nexy, thank you for the super chat.

440
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,150
Thank you, thank you.

441
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,650
Okay, set the price.

442
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:29,650
Okay.

443
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,750
Market price is...

444
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,810
0.2 Okay, 2.

445
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,470
Wait, market price is 312?

446
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,210
Then it should be 4.

447
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,150
Right?

448
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:41,050
4...

449
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,330
No, no.

450
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,430
It should be 5 dollars.

451
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:44,350
5.99.

452
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,390
5.99.

453
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:45,730
No.

454
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,430
Nothing... Nothing ever goes wrong with 5.99.

455
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,850
Okay, market price is...

456
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,710
That's some expensive cereal!

457
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,430
Is cereal that expensive?

458
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,570
I haven't had cereal in years, guys.

459
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,430
Ever since I stopped going to school.

460
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:00,870
Thank you for the...

461
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,950
Thank you for the...

462
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:03,250
Thank you for the super chat.

463
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:03,850
Thank you, thank you.

464
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,330
I hope she made lots of spaghetti.

465
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:09,950
There's no way... There is no way cereal is that expensive now.

466
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,950
Is inflation fucked up that hard?

467
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:13,830
Are we...

468
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,630
Are we in the bad type of inflation now?

469
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,310
All inflation is bad, by the way.

470
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,050
Dude, what?

471
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:25,150
8.99 is like common?

472
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,290
For cereal?

473
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,370
Are you see...

474
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,350
Are you guys...

475
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:30,510
899?

476
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:33,290
Bro!

477
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,650
It doesn't even come with toys anymore!

478
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:38,010
They don't even come with toys!

479
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,730
Cereal is over 10 dollars!

480
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,590
We're at a live!

481
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:42,590
Bro!

482
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:43,590
You know what?

483
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:43,810
Maybe we should go to the supermarket.

484
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,210
Maybe capitalism is a bad idea.

485
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,150
Hello, sir.

486
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:52,150
Will you buy my 8.99 cereal?

487
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:53,770
Oh my god!

488
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,010
Pass is too expensive!

489
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,670
You bought the cereal!

490
00:22:59,190 --> 00:22:59,970
Alright.

491
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,510
Giving zero dollars.

492
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,770
There's nothing to give.

493
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:09,850
How do I...

494
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,020
Approve...

495
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:13,050
Insufficient...

496
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,070
Oh, wait.

497
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:15,630
91.

498
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,890
You gave me 100 dollars for your fucking cereal?

499
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,090
Okay.

500
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,070
60...

501
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,930
70... 80...

502
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:23,750
91.

503
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:26,530
There we go.

504
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:27,830
I can't believe it.

505
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,710
This man gave 100 dollars.

506
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:31,830
Dude, what the do?

507
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:32,890
Okay.

508
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,810
I can't believe this is too expensive.

509
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,210
I can't believe it.

510
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,430
It says market price is 3 dollars.

511
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,810
Like 3.12...

512
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,350
This should have been fine.

513
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:47,690
Okay.

514
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:48,830
Boop.

515
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,270
Oh, credit card.

516
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,090
Oh, thank god.

517
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,310
8.99.

518
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:54,350
Yay!

519
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,990
How is the pass is too expensive?

520
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,250
I don't understand!

521
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:04,330
Okay.

522
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:05,770
Okay, fine.

523
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:06,850
I'll lower it.

524
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,090
I'm gonna lower it to 59 cents.

525
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:09,670
Alright?

526
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:10,450
There.

527
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:15,890
And this is the guy who thought the cereal was 100 bucks.

528
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,030
Many thank you for the server chat.

529
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:18,390
Thank you.

530
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,010
Thank you.

531
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,010
I don't understand!

532
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,090
How could it be that expensive?

533
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,470
I need money!

534
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,350
This is fucked up.

535
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,710
This is so fucked up.

536
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:30,450
Alright.

537
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:31,310
Customization.

538
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:32,170
Storage.

539
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,130
Wait, I want to rename my store.

540
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,810
I want me to rename it to Better Whole Foods.

541
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,150
I can't believe it.

542
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:39,890
Oh, I can have...

543
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,450
I can take a loan.

544
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,910
It is so too expensive!

545
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:45,750
Fine!

546
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:48,550
Five...

547
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:48,770
Okay.

548
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,130
Four...

549
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,230
dollars.

550
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,110
Is that fine?

551
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:54,930
Fine!

552
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:56,790
Four dollars.

553
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:00,170
No, that's way too cheap, man.

554
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,210
Four...

555
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:02,950
Food.

556
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,450
4.50.

557
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,770
Take it or leave it.

558
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,530
Oh, she took it!

559
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,110
Ha ha ha ha ha!

560
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,930
She did take it!

561
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:13,670
Nice!

562
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:14,790
Okay.

563
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:15,730
Thirty...

564
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:17,770
Six...

565
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:18,970
Uh...

566
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,650
Five... one...

567
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,130
Fifty... one...

568
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:25,430
Quick maths.

569
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,430
Ha ha ha ha!

570
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,650
We're doing it!

571
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,410
We found the perfect center!

572
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:31,930
We found it!

573
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,190
Can't take it with the super chat.

574
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:34,570
Thank you.

575
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:35,090
Thank you.

576
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:35,810
What?

577
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,530
You don't want pasta and cereal!

578
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,910
What do you mean you don't want pasta and cereal?

579
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:43,410
It's the perfect combination for your day!

580
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,510
It's literally breakfast, lunch, and dinner!

581
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,910
I give you breakfast, lunch, and dinner!

582
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:49,670
Ha ha ha ha!

583
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,450
Ha ha ha ha!

584
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,850
This is a math simulator.

585
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:58,010
I gave her more than her change?

586
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:58,970
No!

587
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:02,230
The pasta is still too expensive!

588
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,430
This is good pasta!

589
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,070
This is...

590
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,070
What do you mean?

591
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,730
Amy, thank you for the super chat.

592
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,150
Thank you.

593
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:11,690
Thank you.

594
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,930
Weirdo, thank you for the five gifted chips.

595
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:14,370
Thank you.

596
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:14,950
Thank you.

597
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,370
It's like the good type of pasta!

598
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:18,450
Yeah!

599
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:22,430
This man can afford quality life for his children.

600
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:23,610
Alright.

601
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:24,750
Nice.

602
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:25,170
Okay.

603
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:26,310
Two...

604
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:28,670
One...

605
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,650
Here you go.

606
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:30,750
Ha ha ha!

607
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,270
Makes it three nigh- Oh, that's true!

608
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,890
Three ninety-nine.

609
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,010
I'm gonna steal that man's nosey car economics.

610
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,590
Three ninety-nine.

611
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,530
Ha ha ha ha!

612
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,730
There you go.

613
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,270
We're good.

614
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:50,510
There you go.

615
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:51,710
Yay!

616
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:54,710
Seven...

617
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:56,710
Seven...

618
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:57,790
There you go.

619
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,330
We're doing it!

620
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:00,390
The three ninety-nine is...

621
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,710
We're doing it!

622
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,750
We're running a successful store!

623
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,550
Oh my god!

624
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,790
It's really expensive!

625
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,970
You don't deserve the cereal, ma'am!

626
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,470
Come back when you have the money!

627
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,110
For this...

628
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,770
Sick-ass choc- Choccy...

629
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,050
Pick... Bear cereal.

630
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,270
Strong chocolate.

631
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:21,710
Okay.

632
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,370
Maybe this is a bit too much chocolate.

633
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,230
Ha ha ha ha!

634
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:26,950
This is...

635
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,690
Better whole foods!

636
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:33,450
Come back when you can afford to take care of your children with gourmet cereal.

637
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,390
How is that still too expensive?

638
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,830
Okay, what about...

639
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,250
Ninety-eight.

640
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,810
Ninety-eight.

641
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:43,790
We gotta like oversell to make money!

642
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,230
Five...

643
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,010
Six... One...

644
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:47,890
There you go.

645
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,690
Easy.

646
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,990
Ha ha ha ha!

647
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,430
Come...

648
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,970
How is that still too expensive?

649
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:57,570
How is that still too expensive?

650
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:58,490
I don't understand.

651
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:00,150
I don't extend.

652
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:01,850
Alright.

653
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:05,290
My store is not... My store is like...

654
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,910
Good for everybody.

655
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,430
Create more change.

656
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,670
Ha ha ha ha!

657
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:12,910
Alright.

658
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,590
Okay, how about ninety-seven?

659
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,090
Maybe ninety-seven.

660
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:17,490
Ninety-five.

661
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,730
We're gonna find a sweet spot.

662
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:22,370
We're gonna find a sweet spot.

663
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:23,370
Alright.

664
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:24,870
One cent.

665
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,990
There you go.

666
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,350
Oh wait.

667
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,890
You can take your money back but right...

668
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:29,050
Okay.

669
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:30,270
That's one dollar.

670
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,250
No.

671
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:32,770
Okay.

672
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:34,330
I was gonna be like...

673
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,950
You gave them one dollar.

674
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,590
Ha ha ha ha!

675
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,710
Guys, I'm learning.

676
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,850
I'm learning to be the best cashier.

677
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,510
Why is it still too expensive?

678
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,770
First it was pasta, now it's cereal!

679
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:49,050
Okay.

680
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,290
Fifty.

681
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,950
It has to be good.

682
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,030
It has to be the sweet spot.

683
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:56,570
Alright.

684
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,470
Let's see.

685
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,370
How much was it?

686
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,070
Three ninety-nine.

687
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:00,770
There you go.

688
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:02,690
Ma'am!

689
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:05,330
Are you looking for some cereal for your children?

690
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:06,330
Ah!

691
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,570
That's right.

692
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,010
You know the good life.

693
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:09,810
Your chi...

694
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:14,230
This cereal and pasta will make your children so fucking smart.

695
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,490
Trust me.

696
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,670
This is like certified dokey.

697
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:19,550
Dokey.

698
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:20,410
Ha ha ha ha!

699
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:21,910
Ah yes!

700
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:22,730
Rich lady!

701
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:27,370
Are you here to make sure your children are eating well?

702
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,090
Are you here to make sure your children are eating well?

703
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:29,070
You don't love your kids.

704
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,230
Ha ha ha ha!

705
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:34,430
Maybe...

706
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:34,970
Alright.

707
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,190
We need more pasta.

708
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:37,450
There you go.

709
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:38,650
Yay!

710
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:41,050
Alright.

711
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:44,150
At least my pasta is selling now.

712
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:45,490
Yay!

713
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:46,990
Ha ha ha!

714
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,230
Are they still too expensive?

715
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:51,930
Do I have lights?

716
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,510
No, we don't need electricity.

717
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:54,510
I don't want to wait.

718
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:54,750
Wait.

719
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:54,990
Okay.

720
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,150
I need to look at the electricity bill.

721
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,970
Do we have to pay electricity bill?

722
00:29:59,030 --> 00:29:59,410
No.

723
00:29:59,470 --> 00:29:59,710
Okay.

724
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:00,150
Not yet.

725
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:01,670
I was gonna say...

726
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,530
We can have electricity for now.

727
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,510
I need to know.

728
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:08,190
I need to know how much electricity is.

729
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:08,570
Alright.

730
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:08,890
Fine!

731
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,690
Three... Okay.

732
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:10,930
Wait.

733
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:11,130
No.

734
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,370
It was a cereal, right?

735
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,710
Why is cereal so expensive for you?

736
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:15,790
This is market price!

737
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,950
This is actually market price cereal.

738
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:20,010
Okay.

739
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:20,970
Fine.

740
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,510

00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:25,270
We're having a cereal sale.

743
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,010
Serious...

744
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,870
Oh, food's in dark mode.

They see a good bargain.

749
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,710
They know that's a good bargain.

750
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,350

751
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,230

00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,570
Oh, and you can... Oh, okay.

754
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,450
I thought they gave me exact change.

755
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:45,270
There you go.

Slap a 50% discount sign.

00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,420
But... But still sell it at price price!

775
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,300
Profit 10 out of 10!

776
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,240
Also milk and sauce for the cereal and pasta.

777
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,520
Oh my god!

778
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,360
You guys are so fucking smart!

779
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,800
It's like you guys own...

780
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,320
You guys have owned like...

781
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,040
Ha ha ha!

782
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,420
Cereal stores.

783
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,000
Before.

784
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,400
Also give me a sec.

785
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,240
Let me pull up my cereal.

786
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,140
So I can look at Super Chat easier.

787
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,540
Ha ha ha!

788
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:37,640
Okay.

789
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:41,040
So I don't have to scroll up for Super Chats real fast.

790
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:41,440
Alright.

791
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:41,960
Here we go.

792
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,360
We gotta end the day.

793
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,460
Alright.

794
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:45,920
Products found.

795
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:46,880
Expenses 17.

796
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,400
Oh yeah!

797
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,220
I don't need you 17 people!

798
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,280
I have 8 customers!

799
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,640
That can afford my bougie cereal!

800
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,340
They care about their kids!

801
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,080
They care about the well-being of their children!

802
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:03,880
Income.

803
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,360
I have a $56 profit!

804
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:07,240
Yay!

805
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,040
Thank you for the Super Chat!

806
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,520
Thank you!

807
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,260
Oh man!

808
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,440
If I stepped in this shop with this selection, I will feel bad not buying anything!

809
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,260
Exactly!

810
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,380
Ha ha ha!

811
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,040
No receipt date?

812
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:23,960
Nooooo!

813
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,620
Or they'll be paid automatically?

814
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:27,880
Exactly!

815
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,760
The more electrical devices...

816
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,400
What if I don't turn the lights on?

817
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,260
I'll just never turn on the lights!

818
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,300
That's fucked up!

819
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,180
That's so fucked up!

820
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,520
I'll just never turn on the lights!

821
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,480
So I'll never have to pay bills!

822
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,900
Ha ha ha!

823
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,960
If there's no electricity!

824
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,560
Ha ha ha!

825
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:49,580
Okay.

826
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,780
We need bread.

827
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,240
Now people would want bread with their food.

828
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,220
Bread...

829
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,100
and oil to cook pasta.

830
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,140
There we go.

831
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,660
We're going... doing it.

832
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,020
Alright.

833
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,300
Alright.

834
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,000
Let's see.

835
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,440
Wait.

836
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:07,820
Okay.

837
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,240
Here we go.

838
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:08,600
Oil.

839
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:10,580
Alright.

840
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,280
Now we have oil for the pasta!

841
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,380
We love pasta with just oil!

842
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,060
And then...

843
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:16,940
Bread!

844
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,020
Oh shit.

845
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:18,700
Um...

846
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,540
Bread!

847
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,480
Alright.

848
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,660
This is good shelving right there.

849
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,220
You know what?

850
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,200
No, no, no, no, no.

851
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,500
This is... This is optimal shelving.

852
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,340
Alright.

853
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:28,900
Let's see.

854
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,260
What's the market price for bread?

855
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,580
$3.96.

856
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:33,900
$5.

857
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,120
This is like...

858
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:40,620
bread made by one baker in a small village in Italy.

859
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,860
That's when you know it's good bread.

860
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:43,360
Oh!

861
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:43,980
$5.99!

862
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,900
So it looks cheaper.

863
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,020
$5.99.

864
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,460
Ha ha ha!

865
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,720
Oil!

866
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,740
Alright.

867
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,240
$4.50 is the market price.

868
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,060
$6.99.

869
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,420
There we go.

870
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,460
There we go.

871
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:58,740
That's good.

872
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,360
That's good bread.

873
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,300
This bread!

874
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,880
This bread, chat, was made by an 80 year old grandma in Italy.

875
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,320
That's when you know it's good bread.

876
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,640
Ha ha ha!

877
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:21,260
This oil is peanut oil from the forest of Madagascar.

878
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,760
That's when you know it's good peanut oil.

879
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,860
And we're open for business.

880
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:30,320
If you don't buy any of my products, you don't love your children enough.

881
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,440
Thank you for the super chat.

882
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:33,860
Thank you.

883
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,460
Thank you.

884
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,720
Conserving energy like this is five nights at Doki's.

885
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,760
Thank you for the super chat.

886
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,320
Thank you.

887
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,020
Thank you.

888
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,340
It is imported!

889
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,360
How dare you call me a scammer!

890
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:53,620
This is imported peanut oil from Madagascar!

891
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,340
Ha ha ha!

892
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,580
That's a supermarket slogan.

893
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,680
I can get bought.

894
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:04,120
It's like I'll take ten dollars worth of bread, please.

895
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,620
Thank you for the super chat.

896
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,200
Thank you.

897
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:07,880
Thank you.

898
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,200
Ha ha ha!

899
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:10,980
Sir!

900
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,740
How dare you not love your children!

901
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,360
Ha ha ha!

902
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,100
You only give them pasta without the oil?

903
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,560
What is wrong with you?

904
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,880
Ha ha ha!

905
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,740
I can't...

906
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,940
This by the way, the grandma's name is Bron, by the way.

907
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,660
Ha ha ha!

908
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,800
I can't believe it!

909
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,940
Why would grandma... What the fuck?

910
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,600
Bro, carry some fucking change.

911
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,060
What's wrong with you?

912
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,620
Alright, here you go.

913
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:41,860
Alright.

914
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,460
Who carries cash anymore?

915
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,160
Okay, fine.

916
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:49,740
Grandma Ron will not be happy about this.

917
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,560
Ha ha ha!

918
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,460
Ha ha ha!

919
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:53,520
Ha ha ha!

920
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:54,940
Grandma...

921
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,300
You don't really say is Madagascar a movie?

922
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,860
It's based off a play!

923
00:35:59,220 --> 00:35:59,960
Ha ha ha!

924
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,600
Madagascar is an actual place.

925
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,660
It's an actual country.

926
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:05,660
Okay.

927
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,020
Thirteen point five.

928
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,140
Alright.

929
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:09,860
There you go.

930
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,820
This woman loves their children enough.

931
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,220
Alright.

932

We need to order more... We need to order more cereal.

937
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,520
Our cereal is actually going off the shelves right now.

938
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,320
Alright.

939
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,240
Boop boop.

940
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:25,880
Okay.

941
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:26,740
Oh.

942
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,220
Nice.

943
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:27,920
No change.

944
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:29,740
Card.

945
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:30,440
Alright.

946
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:31,980
Eight dollars.

947
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,120
Nice.

948
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:36,460
Okay, we gotta restock our cereal.

949
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,080
Boop boop.

950
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:39,720
Boop boop.

954
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,400
One cereal, please.

00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,360
Thank you.

957
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,140
Thank you.

958
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,640
Ivy, thank you for the super chat.

959
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,040
Thank you.

960
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:49,500
Thank you.

961
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,840
Doki's Whole Foods model.

962
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,940
If you don't buy my products, you don't love your children.

963
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:54,660
Exactly!

964
00:36:55,340 --> 00:37:02,020
This is like... These products, these imported bread and oil, it will make your kids so fucking smart.

965
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:05,140
Okay, four... fifty.

966
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,580
There's a fifty cents now?

967
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,960
When the fuck was there a fifty cents?

968
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,240
Has there always been a fifty... Wait, what did he say was too expensive?

969
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,920
What did he say?

970
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:22,400
When you don't have kids, then you're not thinking about your future.

971
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,400
Don't you...

972
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:24,920
I...

973
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,260
You need to have kids so you can buy my products.

974
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,720
Have children so they can buy my products!

975
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,320
And also subscribe to me on the YouTube.

976
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,660
That is important.

977
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,760
Okay, one cereal.

978
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,500
Thank you for buying my stuff.

979
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,380
Bread is bread.

980
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,080
Here's ten more dollars to take it back.

981
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,500
Oil is too expensive?

982
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,020
Okay.

983
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,480
Okay, fine.

984
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,820
We'll do six dollars.

985
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,300
Are you happy now?

986
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,860
Are you happy now, Janice?

987
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,480
Are you fucking happy now?

988
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,460
I have to pay rent!

989
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,600
Okay?

990
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,600
Doki's Whole Food needs to survive.

991
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:07,560
Are you happy about ruining small business?

992
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,960
You're the reason why small businesses don't prosper.

993
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,180
Okay.

994
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,400
Let's see.

995
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,860
19.99 Oh my god!

996
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,020
You love your children!

997
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,100
Sir, I'm so happy for you.

998
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,220
Guys!

999
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,760
This is...

1000
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,220
Guys, guys.

1001
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,880
Support local businesses.

1002
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:43,720
Please.

1003
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,080
Support local businesses.

1004
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,000
Guys, I'm almost done with my objective.

1005
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,020
Please buy my stuff.

1006
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:50,500
Buy my products.

1007
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,520
This is so fucked.

1008
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,140
Imagine like a store manager.

1009
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,300
Just be like, please buy my products.

1010
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,360
Please.

1011
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:57,800
Please.

1012
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,280
You look like a lady who needs cereal.

1013
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,680
Do you need some cereal, ma'am?

1014
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,080
Oh my god!

1015
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:07,900
She bought two bread!

1016
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,400
And it's oil!

1017
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,540
Oh my god!

1018
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,700
She's gonna make a grilled cheese!

1019
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,020
Alright, nice.

1020
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,640
Okay, money.

1021
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,240
Oh, and she pays an exact change.

1022
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:18,980
I love her.

1023
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,820
I love what every business wants.

1024
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,600
Wings, thank you for the super chat.

1025
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:23,960
Thank you.

1026
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:24,560
Thank you.

1027
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,760
Treating kids like a Costco membership.

1028
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,040
Thank you for the super chat.

1029
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:30,540
Thank you.

1030
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,100
Thank you.

1031
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,420
One, two, three.

1032
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,320
Ta-da!

1033
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,540
I'm making so much money now!

1034
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,620
Look at me!

1035
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,560
I have a hundred and sixty-four dollars!

1036
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,980
She love her kids.

1037
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,480
Alright, nice.

1038
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:44,980
Eight dollars.

1039
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,080
Oh my god, I'm getting better at math.

1040
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,860
Oil is too expensive.

1041
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,880
You are never meant to be in my store.

1042
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,120
Oh, but you bought two cereals, so that's okay.

1043
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,220
That's more money.

1044
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,200
Nevermind.

1045
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,300
Welcome back, sir.

1046
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,140
I hope you enjoy your stay.

1047
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,900
Purchase product license?

1048
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:02,620
For what?

1049
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,620
What do I need product license for?

1050
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,680
I have everything I've ever wanted.

1051
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,260
Cereal, bread, and pasta.

1052
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,400
And oil.

1053
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,640
Extreme, thank you for the super chat.

1054
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,020
Thank you.

1055
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:19,420
Thank you.

1056
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:19,860
I'm sorry.

1057
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:24,000
I was trying to get the pickles, but I accidentally locked it over the pickle display in aisle six.

1058
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,860
But I'm covered in pickle juice, and the entire store smells like pickles.

1059
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,780
I hope this covers the cost.

1060
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,600
Thank you for the super chat.

1061
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:30,940
Thank you.

1062
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,400
Thank you.

1063
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,100
You can't afford my pasta!

1064
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,440
Go back and buy macaroni and cheese!

1065
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,960
Which I love macaroni and cheese, by the way.

1066
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,580
No hate on macaroni and cheese.

1067
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,360
But this is bougie pasta.

1068
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:47,240
Alright, we're not turning on the lights because I need to save save electricity.

1069
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,860
Uh, I need...

1070
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,500
Guys!

1071
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,820
We need to save electricity!

1072
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,800
We don't need lights!

1073
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,080
We don't need lights, guys!

1074
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,260
Guys, this is important.

1075
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,240
We are a small local business.

1076
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,200
What do you think?

1077
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,780
You think we're actual Whole Foods?

1078
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,440
We're not!

1079
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,140
We're better Whole Foods, but we're not the better yet.

1080
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,180
Okay.

1081
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,580
Wait, I'm so poor.

1082
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,600
I can't afford any product license.

1083
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,540
My favorite grilled cheese without the cheese.

1084
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,480
It's okay.

1085
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:29,520
I can defend my store in the dark.

1086
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,600
Alright, nice.

1087
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,740
What do you... Okay, cash.

1088
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,860
One dollar.

1089
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,240
Ooh, I like you, sir.

1090
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:36,720
Nice.

1091
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,040
Alright.

1092
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,020
Card.

1093
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,320
Um... Six dollars.

1094
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,120
We're Half Foods!

1095
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,100
We're Half Foods!

1096
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,740
We're not at the Whole Foods section yet, guys.

1097
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,300
We're merely in the Half Foods section.

1098
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,440
One day, we'll be like Whole Foods.

1099
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,400
A hundred dollar profit!

1100
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,140
Nice!

1101
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:57,260
Alright.

1102
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,060
Nice.

1103
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,600
Do I have to pay any bills yet?

1104
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,040
Bank.

1105
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,000
Okay, no.

1106
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,400
We're not getting a loan.

1107
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,320
Management.

1108
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,160
Bills.

1109
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,440
But see!

1110
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,480
Look at that!

1111
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,720
Look at that, chat!

1112
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,540
I didn't turn on the lights I didn't turn on the lights and only 52 cents!

1113
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,220
That is how you spend money.

1114
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,640
That is exactly how you save money.

1115
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,900
Why use lights?

1116
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,620
My phone can produce lights.

1117
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,940
Guys, my phone produces light.

1118
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:39,420
So, why the fuck would I need any electricity?

1119
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,800
If I can't see anything, I take out my phone.

1120
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,580
Sounds like my dad.

1121
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,780
It is called being a small business trying to survive in the harsh world.

1122
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,680
Okay, do I need...

1123
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,540
I don't have the level yet.

1124
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:54,860
Alright.

1125
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,020
Oh, we need to restock.

1126
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,740
We need to restock on our imported peanut oil.

1127
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:00,700
Alright.

1128
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,240
Where is product?

1129
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:02,860
Oops.

1130
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:03,700
Okay.

1131
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,320
Oil.

1132
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:07,540
Alright.

1133
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,560
We just need oil.

1134
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,360
That's fine.

1135
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,540
Yes, Mr. Krabs.

1136
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,120
Thank you.

1137
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,360
Thank you.

1138
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,340
Thank you.

1139
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:16,680
Thank you.

1140
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:16,680
Yeah!

1141
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,660
But Mr. Krabs is a fucking millionaire!

1142
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:20,820
Look!

1143
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,380
I will be...

1144
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:25,080
Mr. Krabs is a role model!

1145
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,380
He is a cutthroat business crab!

1146
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,560
He knows what it's like...

1147
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,900
He has a whale daughter to fucking care for.

1148
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,280
Do you know how much whales eat?

1149
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,640
Okay, let's see.

1150
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,560
Sixteen dollars.

1151
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,660
Whales eat a lot of food!

1152
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:47,580
And then he has to pay for college tuition!

1153
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:53,380
I like money!

1154
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,580
He likes money!

1155
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,160
We all like money here.

1156
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:02,120
God, thank you for the super chat.

1157
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:02,760
Thank you.

1158
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:03,500
Thank you.

1159
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:04,480
Oh my god.

1160
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,080
We need cereal.

1161
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,060
We need cereal.

1162
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,560
We need a picture for the cereal demand.

1163
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,260
Don't worry!

1164
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,740
I will make sure that the demand is met.

1165
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:14,920
Oh my god.

1166
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,600
No, ma'am!

1167
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,360
Do not buy anything!

1168
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:17,820
The cereal is coming!

1169
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,040
Okay.

1170
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,360
There we go.

1171
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:24,220
Nice.

1172
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:24,740
Alright.

1173
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,340
Wait, she didn't buy anything.

1174
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:27,480
What?

1175
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,540
You don't love your children?

1176
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:29,840
You don't love your kids?

1177
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:31,380
What's your husband gonna think?

1178
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,800
Oh my god.

1179
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:34,360
Thank you for the super chat.

1180
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:34,840
Thank you.

1181
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,420
Thank you.

1182
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:37,680
Thank you for the super chat.

1183
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,180
Thank you.

1184
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:38,760
Thank you.

1185
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,480
Don't keep your ass remember her first dollar.

1186
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:42,900
Thank you for the super chat.

1187
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:43,340
Thank you.

1188
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:43,920
Thank you.

1189
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:44,560
Alright.

1190
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,340
Let's see.

1191
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:46,100
Six.

1192
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,040
Alright.

1193
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,440
I can't believe it.

1194
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,820
You're willing to buy expensive bread but not expensive cereal.

1195
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:54,980
Oh my god.

1196
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:57,600
This bread is more expensive than the fucking cereal.

1197
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,580
Like, what the fuck is...

1198
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,320
Actually, never mind.

1199
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,780
Five dollar profit.

1200
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:02,260
Oh yeah.

1201
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:07,600
Super.

00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:08,700
Thank you.

1204
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:16,580
Thank you for the super chat as well Okay, there's no chance in hell Pearl is smart enough for a scholarship.

1205
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:22,730
That's right.

1206
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:24,150
I said it.

1207
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:25,690
I said it.

1208
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:28,170
There's no way Pearl can have a...

1209
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:29,450
Can get a scholarship.

1210
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:30,870
That's fucking right.

1211
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:36,970
She has to be able to afford her college.

1212
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:39,870
Don't do it like that!

1213
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:40,550
What?

1214
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:42,230
How is she gonna get to college?

1215
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:44,990
The cheerleading?

1216
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:48,030
Oh yeah, as if like... yeah, yeah.

1217
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:51,270
There's like how many people in Bikini Bottom?

1218
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:54,450
How many people in Bikini Bottom?

1219
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:58,870
I don't think they're giving out scholarships for a fucking cheerleading.

1220
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:04,270
Yeah, thank you for the super chat.

1221
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:05,130
Thank you, thank you.

1223
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:08,510
That is a good customer.

1224
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:17,910
Hello, would you like to give a tip for a small business woman?

1225
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:19,730
For your local businesses?

1226
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:21,130
I don't have a tip jar.

1227
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:22,350
I should have a tip jar.

1228
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:27,090
Whole Foods might not have a tip jar, but Half Foods does.

1229
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:29,230
Oh, $212!

1230
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:30,650

1231
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:32,110
Oh, I'm level 3!

1232
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:34,130
I can buy a product.

1233
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:34,810
Okay, what can I sell?

1234
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:35,770
Bottled water!

1235
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:36,930
Guys, guys.

1236
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:39,690
Evian water is coming in hot now.

1237
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:40,570
Guys.

1238
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:42,610
Oh my god, this is it!

1239
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,270
We're in the big leagues now!

1240
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:46,250
We have bottled water!

1241
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:49,330
We're moving up!

1242
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:51,390
We're not just gonna be Half Foods!

1243
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:54,090
Okay, how much is bottled water?

1244
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:57,310
Okay, bottled water is $15.

1245
00:46:57,590 --> 00:46:58,690
I can afford bottled water!

1246
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:01,770
Oh my god, we're actually in the big leagues.

1247
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:03,870
Oh my god, we have water!

1248
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:06,190
Boop.

1249
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:06,650
Wait.

1250
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:08,110
This product... wait, what?

1251
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:10,850
I need to be put on a fridge?

1252
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:13,070
God damn it.

1253
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:14,030
Okay, guys.

1254
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:15,330
We're not in the big leagues yet.

1255
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:16,470
I can't afford a fridge.

1256
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:18,330
That's like electricity!

1257
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:20,370
Who wants cold water?

1258
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,430
Put it in the fridge yourself!

1259
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:28,370
Who the fuck wants cold water?

1260
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:33,310
I don't understand.

1261
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:35,590
Okay, we need more bread.

1262
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:41,010
We need to sell... Room temperature water is just fine!

1263
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:49,530
Room temperature water is good enough.

1264
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:51,110
Oh shit, incorrect payment.

1265
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:52,410
Who cares?

1266
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:55,050
Okay, 5.5.

1267
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:55,950
Nice.

1268
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:57,810
Okay, boop.

1269
00:47:57,850 --> 00:47:58,430
Card?

1270
00:47:58,570 --> 00:47:58,890
Nice.

1271
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:01,050
Card is nice, because I don't have to worry about...

1272
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:01,590
Uh...

1273
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:04,930
Alright, I don't have to worry about math.

1274
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:06,510
I can just put numbers down.

1275
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:07,590
Okay, cereal, bread.

1276
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:09,650
I don't... I can't afford a fridge!

1277
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:11,790
What do you mean?

1278
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:14,070
Fridge?

1279
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:16,250
It's $200?!

1280
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:18,350
Oh my god!

1281
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:20,010
I'm not made of money!

1282
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:22,190
Okay.

1283
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:25,590
Thirty... two... fifty.

1284
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:26,330
Cereal.

1285
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:29,570
A name started taking the super chat.

1286
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:30,210
Thank you, thank you.

1287
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:33,930
Remind that Mr. Krabs make Spongebob pay to work at the Krusty Krab.

1288
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:34,990
Oh my god!

1289
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:36,950
Guys, who wants to work at...

1290
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:44,490
For one Akasupa, you can have the privilege to work in my store for a day.

1291
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,570
It's like an internship, guys.

1292
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:53,810
Think about like the amazing reference I can work... I can write for you.

1293
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:00,550
Guys, just think about it.

1294
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:03,710
Think about the amazing reference you're gonna get.

1295
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:05,310
If you work at Half Foods.

1296
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:07,690
What a deal!

1297
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:10,650
Also, it's like one Aka a day, though, by the way.

1298
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:13,210
It's one Aka a day.

1299
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:15,770
Just so you guys know.

1300
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:16,850
Um...

1301
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:18,770
Zalphius, thank you for the super chat.

1302
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:19,490
Thank you, thank you.

1303
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:26,390
Who wants Evian water when you can buy locally sourced Evian tap water bottle by the local kids for free?

1304
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:28,050
Only $100.

1305
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:30,050
Thank you for the super chat.

1306
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:31,370
Thank you, thank you, Zalphius.

1307
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:33,210
Now somebody is thanking.

1308
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:34,070
What do you think about my business?

1309
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:37,070
That's a good business owner right there.

1310
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:38,870
3.99.

1311
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:40,290
Here we go.

1312
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:43,590
This is the night time experience.

1313
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:46,170
The only store that's in the dark.

1314
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:48,630
We have to save on electricity.

1315
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:52,250
We are not made of money.

1316
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:58,590
The only reason we're in the dark is because it's your fault, customers.

1317
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,710
You don't pay...

1318
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:13,070
I'm here for my shift.

1319
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:15,150
Oh, thank God.

1320
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:18,350
Alright, so anyway, I'll just be like the supervisor now.

1321
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:21,930
What?

1322
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:27,430
Minus 84 profit?

1323
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:30,370
Oh my God.

1324
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:32,210
Thank God for my free interns.

1325
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:38,610
I need the references for my resume.

1326
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:40,210
Oh, thank God.

1327
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:42,970
Thank God for my free interns.

1328
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:46,870
Oh, I don't have enough for anything.

1329
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:48,330
Okay, we need more oil.

1330
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:49,790
Alright, oil.

1331
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:51,470
There we go.

1332
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:52,250
Purchase.

1333
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:55,250
Uh, Lori Tanda, thank you for the Akasuba.

1334
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:56,270
Thank you, thank you.

1335
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:58,170
So when is my first day?

1336
00:50:58,210 --> 00:51:00,230
Right now, stock these shows for me.

1337
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:07,990
I wish this has like, if only this has like Twitch plays, Supermarket Simulator, so I can like actually hire my...

1338
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:09,810
Viewers.

1339
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:17,750
You know like those, like the call of the lamb where you can get viewer participation?

1340
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:21,530
Man, if only I could get viewer participation.

1341
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:25,490
The multiplayer store already.

1342
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:27,990
And I could just sit here and order items.

1343
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:33,690
Oh shit, what are the biz?

1344
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:35,590
Do I have to pay any biz?

1345
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:37,310
Biz.

1346
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:38,150
Rent?

1347
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:39,990
I paid for rent!

1348
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:41,770
$20 a day?

1349
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:43,310
That's like a scam!

1350
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:47,030
I'm just a small business!

1351
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:50,930
The $20 is like one peanut oil.

1352
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:51,950
Oh my God.

1353
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:53,310
Hahaha.

1354
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:56,370
Boom, thank you for the Akasuba!

1355
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:57,630
Thank you, thank you.

1356
00:51:57,650 --> 00:51:59,270
Do we get cool name tags?

1357
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:04,250
Guys, with enough Akas, we can afford one cashier.

1358
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:07,470
Guys, you see, daily wage is...

1359
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:10,150
You guys pay me $80.

1360
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:17,010
Guys, with enough Akas, we can finally afford a cashier!

1361
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:18,730
Oh, okay.

1362
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:19,330
Nice.

1363
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:20,370
Alright.

1364
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:21,830
Oh, we need pasta.

1365
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:23,070
Pasta!

1366
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:24,190
Where's pasta?

1367
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:26,530
Alright, pasta.

1368
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:29,490
Guys, I need $200, guys.

1369
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:30,630
Please.

1370
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:31,970
$14.

1371
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:33,950
Four.

1372
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:34,790
Oh, whoops.

1373
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:35,990
Nice.

1374
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:37,830
I can leave 50 checkouts!

1375
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:39,630
Oh my gosh, I'm doing it.

1376
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:42,290
I'm being the wagey I've always wanted to be.

1377
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:43,870
Where's my pasta?

1378
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:44,690
Okay, pasta.

1379
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:45,890
Alright.

1380
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:48,550
We don't care about your fucking opinion.

1381
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:49,190
Annie.

1382
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:53,810
You spent less on that fucking...

1383
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:56,230
You spent less on...

1384
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:58,610
Okay, you clearly need sunscreen.

1385
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:01,250
You spent less at the hair salon.

1386
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:05,150
Maybe you can afford Granny Ron's bread.

1387
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:08,970
Now your family's gonna be breadless.

1388
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:11,690
You can clearly afford fucking bread.

1389
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:17,770
If you only have $100 bills, you can totally afford bread.

1390
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:18,390
Okay?

1391
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:22,350
You're just a cheapskate.

1392
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:25,750
I hope your kids hate you.

1393
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:26,850
Alright, card.

1394
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:27,390
Nice.

1395
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:29,550
She gave you $100.

1396
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:32,050
Alright, nice.

1397
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:34,530
$160.

1398
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:36,070
Guys, I need $100!

1399
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:39,450
Anybody wanna shop and have food?

1400
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:40,350
Whoa!

1401
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:43,890
Look.

1402
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:46,550
Chat, you don't understand.

1403
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:47,970
Chat, you don't understand.

1404
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:49,810
This supermarket game is very scary.

1405
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:54,610
This supermarket game is very intense, guys.

1406
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:55,650
You don't understand.

1407
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:56,730
Okay?

1408
00:53:56,770 --> 00:54:00,430
You'll never understand the life of a supermarket boner.

1409
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:03,670
Okay, calm down.

1410
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:05,070
I can't calm down!

1411
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:08,730
She criticized my pasta and bread!

1412
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:13,790
That grandma in Italy needs that money!

1413
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:15,790
Okay.

1414
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:16,230
I'm counting.

1415
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:17,630
Intensifies.

1416
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:19,310
Guys!

1417
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:21,650
Think about Granny Ron!

1418
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:25,370
Won't anybody think about Granny Ron from Italy?

1419
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:28,850
She cares about Granny Ron!

1420
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:32,010
She cares so much about her Granny Ron.

1421
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:34,450
She gave me $250.

1422
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:35,410
Nice.

1423
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:35,850
Okay.

1424
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:36,730
Alright.

1425
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:38,530
Five, six, seven, eight, nine.

1426
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:39,250
There you go.

1427
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:41,350
Thank you for shopping at Half Foods.

1428
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:44,350
Ron's sliced bread is too expensive.

1429
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:45,450
What did you buy?

1430
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:47,170
You buy two cereals and zero bread?

1431
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:49,430
It's like almost the same.

1432
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:52,650
It's almost the same.

1433
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:55,850
Put in some checkout count and you won't even have to pay.

1434
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:56,890
Oh my God!

1435
00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:58,510
Frank, you're so smart.

1436
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:00,530
We can let techno...

1437
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:03,790
AI can finally steal everybody's work.

1438
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:05,730
Oh my God!

1439
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:07,850
Oh my God!

1440
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:10,930
Finally, the AI uprising we needed.

1441
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,110
They started out small.

1442
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:15,470
First the checkout cashiers.

1443
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:17,470
Then the world.

1444
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:20,690
The Walmart approach.

1445
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:22,810
It's actually scary though.

1446
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:30,370
Now there's some McDonald's that are only run by self checkout.

1447
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:32,070
Everything is just automated.

1448
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:34,950
I remember reading an article about that.

1449
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:38,570
That there's McDonald's restaurants that are just fully automated.

1450
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:41,330
Even taking orders and everything.

1451
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:46,130
Yeah, like making food and taking orders and giving orders and stuff.

1452
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:47,530
I don't know.

1453
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:49,070
I think it has to be in America.

1454
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:51,830
Only somebody in America would do something like that.

1455
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:57,410
Oh, my cereal!

1456
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:01,650
Everybody loves cereal.

1457
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:02,910
Okay.

1458
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:04,290
Alright.

1459
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:05,530
Grab that cereal.

1460
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:12,970
Someone's like, we have those in New York City.

1461
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:13,970
They suck.

1462
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:16,790
Money.

1463
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:18,430
50 cents.

1464
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:19,150
There you go.

1465
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:20,670
You love bread.

1466
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:22,990
Thank you for supporting your local granny.

1467
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:25,550
$31.

1468
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:26,610
Nice.

1469
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,820
I can't wait for the AI takeover.

1470
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:33,820
It gives me more time.

1471
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:36,860
Cam.

1472
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,700
You have all the time.

1473
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:41,800
But where the money to you?

1474
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:42,820
To you.

1475
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,300
Cam, you forgot.

1476
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:46,860
The money.

1477
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:51,960
If all the robots take over all the jobs, how do we make money?

1478
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:52,740
Yeah.

1479
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:57,040
Who would give you the money to keep working?

1480
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:58,720
That's not keep working.

1481
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,220
To do whatever you want.

1482
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:01,940
Alright.

1483
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:02,420
Nice.

1484
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:03,600
Where's the tomatoes?

1485
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,220
Tomatoes cost a fridge.

1486
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,820
Does it look like I have the money for fridge?

1487
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:09,220
Okay.

1488
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,320
We need more.

1489
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:11,000
Okay.

1490
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:11,700
Nice.

1491
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:13,240
I can finally afford.

1492
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:14,520
I can afford a fridge.

1493
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:15,860
Oh my god.

1494
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:18,600
I can afford a fridge.

1495
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:19,080
Okay.

1496
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,120
Fridge time.

1497
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,120
Fridge A.

1498
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,360
Alright.

1499
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:25,120
$200.

1500
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:25,720
Yeah.

1501
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,040
Okay.

1502
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:28,320
Where's my fridge?

1503
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,360
Oh my god.

1504
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:32,700
Sir, please wait a little bit.

1505
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,020
I'm putting a fridge.

1506
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:35,860
Okay.

1507
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:37,400
Nice.

1508
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:38,420
Exact bills.

1509
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:39,180
I love that.

1510
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:41,680
One bill.

1511
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:42,120
$200.

1512
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:43,460
Nice.

1513
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:43,900
Okay.

1514
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:46,600
We can finally put our expensive avian water.

1515
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:49,540
Yay!

1516
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,080
Alright.

1517
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:53,980
What do you want?

1518
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:59,280
Would you like to buy our expensive avian water real fast before you do?

1519
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:01,020
No?

1520
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:01,900
It's alright.

1521
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:03,800
It's alright.

1522
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:04,360
Alright.

1523
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:05,620
Where's my water?

1524
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:06,120
Okay.

1525
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:07,440
How much for water?

1526
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:08,340
Two.

1527
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:09,340
Five dollars.

1528
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,680
This is like $200.

1529
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:14,420
This is not Amazon 99 cents.

1530
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:15,380
Shit.

1531
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:16,200
Oh no.

1532
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:16,800
No.

1533
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,440
Not zero dollars.

1534
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:23,600
Oh, there's more people coming in.

1535
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:24,920
Oh, nice.

1536
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:27,120
Uh...

1537
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,000
Uh...

1538
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:30,940
27.

1539
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:31,680
Sorry.

1540
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:32,920
I couldn't see that you used your card.

1541
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:34,200
Did you buy water?

1542
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,580
Was water too expensive?

1543
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:37,600
Oh, you don't want basic necessities?

1544
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:38,420
Sir?

1545
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:40,280
That's Fiji water right there.

1546
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,680
That's not regular water.

1547
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,920
This is from a fucking island.

1548
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,780
I think five dollars is perfect.

1549
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,420
What a deal.

1550
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:57,940
Nuki, stop.

1551
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:00,740
Sir, it's good water, sir.

1552
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:06,880
Thank you for the super chat.

1553
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:07,340
Thank you.

1554
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:07,900
Thank you.

1555
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:11,300
Nuki, I need you to do a Costco livestream ASAP.

1556
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:11,680
I'm sorry.

1557
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:15,820
I need a stream of you walking around Costco and picking out your favorite Gurtland products.

1558
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:17,740
Costco sponsor.

1559
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:22,860
Super chat.

1560
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:23,400
Thank you.

1561
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:23,980
Thank you.

1562
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:25,960
Guys, it's because I bought a fridge.

1563
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:26,480
Okay.

1564
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,240
I had to...

1565
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,220
I need a...

1566
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:29,960
Okay, you know what?

1567
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,500
I'm going to make my entire fridge just... just water.

1568
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:37,360
This is...

1569
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:37,780
Okay, no.

1570
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:38,740
Water and milk.

1571
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:39,460
Wait.

1572
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:40,380
Okay.

1573
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:41,600
What do you guys...

1574
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:41,680
I'm going to make my entire fridge just...

1575
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:41,680
just water.

1576
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:41,840
Okay.

1577
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:42,640
Cheese!

1578
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:43,980
Cheese for the pasta!

1579
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:45,380
This is it.

1580
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:48,160
Now we're thinking supermarket owner.

1581
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:49,700
Cheese for the pasta.

1582
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,240
Wait, we're running out of stuff.

1583
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:51,760
Wait.

1584
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:52,300
Okay.

1585
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,280
Uh...

1586
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,240
We need pasta.

1587
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:57,900
Uh...

1588
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:00,100
Okay, let's just stock up everything for now.

1589
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:00,940
We have the money.

1590
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:01,700
All right.

1591
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:05,720
If we have everything we need to stock up, we don't have to worry about anything.

1592
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:06,620
All right.

1593
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:09,520
Okay, we're going to put this away.

1594
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:11,280
Oh my gosh.

1595
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:11,660
Our store is...

1596
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,960
Our store is becoming so big now!

1597
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:20,320
We're getting closer to closer to like, uh, three fourths of food.

1598
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:22,040
Okay.

1599
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:23,280
What's after half foods?

1600
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:25,880
Two quarters food?

1601
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:29,660
What's after half foods, guys?

1602
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,020
I'll put cheese.

1603
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,600
It needs to be in the fridge.

1604
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:34,560
God damn it.

1605
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:35,600
We don't want cold cheese.

1606
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:37,900
Food temperature.

1607
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,620
Room temperature cheese is okay.

1608
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:41,660
Guys.

1609
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:41,960
Guys.

1610
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,600
Sometimes you have to settle.

1611
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:44,840
Guys.

1612
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,260
Sometimes you can settle for...

1613
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:48,800
Oh, I'm too poor for eggs.

1614
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:50,840
I'm too poor for eggs.

1615
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,640
Okay, I can't afford milk though.

1616
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:53,660
All right.

1617
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,220
We're gonna fully stock up.

1618
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,560
It'll get mulled?

1619
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:01,120
That's the point of cheese!

1620
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:03,980
Good cheese has mold!

1621
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,100
This is why this is called...

1622
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:10,020
This is half foods.

1623
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:11,080
You guys don't understand.

1624
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:11,660
Okay.

1625
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:14,640
Good cheese has mold.

1626
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:16,920
Doki, no.

1627
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:23,640
You just don't understand good marketing.

1628
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:28,980
Doki, please.

1629
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,200
All right.

1630
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:31,580
Nice.

1631
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:32,100
We're open.

1632
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:33,860
I forgot to buy oil.

1633
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:35,140
I can't afford oil.

1634
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:36,220
No!

1635
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:39,220
Thank you for the super chat.

1636
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:39,540
Thank you.

1637
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:40,000
Thank you.

1638
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:41,220
I don't have...

1639
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:41,640
I don't have any oil.

1640
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:42,940
I don't have enough money for tomatoes!

1641
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:44,200
Look!

1642
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,060
I can only do...

1643
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:46,880
There's cake.

1644
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:48,160
There's chicken.

1645
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,320
Where the fuck is the fruit section?

1646
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:52,680
There's cleaner chips.

1647
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:53,400
There's beer.

1648
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,100
Oh my god.

1649
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,720
Guys, we need 3,500.

1650
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:56,660
Guys!

1651
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,780
Why can't the bank give me a loan for beer?

1652
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:04,440
There's books, but there's no fruit?

1653
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,020
What is my store?

1654
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:08,020
All right.

1655
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,120
Nice.

1656
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:10,560
Okay.

1657
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,200
$16.

1658
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:11,620
$16.

1659
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:13,500
All right.

1660
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:14,580
Money.

1661
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:14,960
Oh.

1662
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:15,620
Okay.

1663
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:16,180
Eight.

1664
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:18,260
We're getting better at this.

1665
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:19,400
We're getting...

1666
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:19,720
Oh god.

1667
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:20,020
Okay.

1668
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,060
I can afford oil now.

1669
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:22,400
Uh...

1670
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:22,940
Oil.

1671
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:25,540
Nice.

1672
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:25,760
Okay.

1673
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:27,180
This is good.

1674
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:28,420
This is good.

1675
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:30,340
Oh no!

1676
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,020
Wrong...

1677
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:31,960
Wrong shelf.

1678
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:32,260
Wait.

1679
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:33,020
What shelf was it?

1680
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:33,560
Is it this one?

1681
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:37,140
Okay.

1682
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,420
I need a better shelving system.

1683
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:40,260
Why me?

1684
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:41,620
I need a better shelving system.

1685
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:44,680
Guys, I need a better shelving system.

1686
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,260
I already forgot where it was.

1687
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:47,380
Guys!

1688
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:49,400
Guys, does anyone want to shop?

1689
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:50,060
Oh my god.

1690
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:50,680
You have money.

1691
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:51,620
You're wearing a tuxedo.

1692
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:53,900
You want mine?

1693
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:54,700
The peanut oil?

1694
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:56,440
Look.

1695
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:56,680
Hey.

1696
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:57,460
This is new here.

1697
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:58,840
Cheese is too expensive!

1698
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:02,260
Water is too expensive!

1699
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:03,500
God.

1700
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:04,080
Okay.

1701
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:05,840
4.99.

1702
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:07,100
There we go.

1703
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,040
They don't know.

1704
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:10,820
They're not cultured enough.

1705
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:11,620
Okay.

1706
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:12,380
We're putting 99.

1707
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:12,980
There we go.

1708
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,780
Why is my water so expensive?

1709
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,100
It's from an island!

1710
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,620
It's literally from an island!

1711
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,380
Where are my, like...

1712
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:26,520
Where are my, like, Jack Blacks and Tom Hanks?

1713
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:27,960
Where are they?

1714
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:29,500
They can afford my water.

1715
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:30,520
They care.

1716
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:34,880
Alright.

1717
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:38,660
4.50.

1718
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:39,060
Fine!

1719
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:41,620
I'll go 4.50, but that's the lowest I'll pay.

1720
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,360
That's the lowest I'll go.

1721
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,280
$4.50.

1722
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:47,940
I'll take the $2 profit.

1723
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,740
Round Duck, thank you for the super chat.

1724
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:52,160
Thank you.

1725
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:52,620
Thank you.

1726
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:53,740
I will never change the oil.

1727
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,600
My peanut oil from Madagascar.

1728
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,800
It has too deep and bitter of a flavor.

1729
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:00,720
Thank you for the super chat.

1730
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:01,140
Thank you.

1731
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:01,720
Thank you.

1732
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:02,960
$4.49.

1733
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:03,600
You're right.

1734
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:04,780
$4.49.

1735
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:06,900
When they see the 9, they know it's a steal.

1736
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:08,700
$4.49.

1737
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:09,620
Oh my god.

1738
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:11,260
You guys are good business people.

1739
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,720
Good business goons.

1740
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,200
Milk is too expensive?

1741
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:18,320
Oh my god.

1742
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:21,220
Why is everything too expensive for all of you?

1743
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:24,760
If you guys think everything is too expensive, you would not have gone to Half Foods.

1744
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:26,740
Whole Foods is like right next door.

1745
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,020
You know what you were expecting in Half Foods.

1746
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:39,600
It might not have been a good business choice to be right next to Whole Foods.

1747
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:40,460
But...

1748
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:45,100
But it was the cheapest place to rent.

1749
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,540
$3.48.

1750
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:51,800
God damn it.

1751
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:52,140
Fine.

1752
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:53,020
Fine.

1753
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:56,280
I'll go down to $4.2.

1754
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,140
I'm willing to haggle.

1755
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,340
It's $4.2 now.

1756
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:03,860
Welcome to Quarter Foods.

1757
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:07,500
Guys.

1758
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:09,380
Guys, you'll regret this.

1759
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:11,700
I'll remember all your faces.

1760
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:16,260
You'll regret not buying from my store when I become big.

1761
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:21,060
See?

1762
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,580
She likes the cheese.

1763
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:23,720
Okay.

1764
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:24,860
$95.

1765
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:25,740
Jesus Christ.

1766
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:26,720
She likes the cheese too.

1767
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,660
If you love cheese so much, why didn't you buy more?

1768
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:30,600
Please.

1769
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:32,180
Support your local businesses.

1770
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:35,660
Fine.

1771
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,260
$0.10.

1772
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:39,540
The lowest I'll go.

1773
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:40,500
Haha.

1774
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,180
It doesn't even have mud.

1775
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:48,680
Because they won't let me put it in room temperature.

1776
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,160
I can't believe it.

1777
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:51,700
Wait.

1778
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:52,540
Do I have to pay my bills?

1779
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:54,220
I might have forgotten about my bills.

1780
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:55,760
Bills.

1781
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:56,600
Oh shit.

1782
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:57,660
Oh, 0.49.

1783
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:58,120
Nice.

1784
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:58,380
Okay.

1785
01:05:58,420 --> 01:05:58,740
$20.

1786
01:05:59,020 --> 01:05:59,520
Alright.

1787
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:00,220
That's fine.

1788
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:00,820
Nice.

1789
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:02,460
Do you like my water?

1790
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,440
Is bottled water good enough?

1791
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:06,220
Is it good enough?

1792
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:07,460
Oh, it's good enough.

1793
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:07,680
Enough.

1794
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:08,960
Come on.

1795
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:10,580
Come on.

1796
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:14,420
Couldn't find... What do you mean you want coffee?

1797
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:16,020
Ma'am!

1798
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:18,560
We don't have a lot of things in the store.

1799
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:22,680
Okay, four.

1800
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:23,900
Nice.

1801
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:24,960
Alright, what do you want?

1802
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,680
Ooh, cereal and pasta?

1803
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:28,820
You're gonna have a fun night, sir.

1804
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:30,460
It's gonna be so fun.

1805
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:32,140
Okay.

1806
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:33,320
Alright.

1807
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:35,200
Let's see.

1808
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,020
Fine.

1809
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:40,240
I am willing to go $5.99 on the oil.

1810
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:44,800
My distributors are not gonna be happy about this.

1811
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:47,760
But I'm willing to go for this bargain.

1812
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:48,580
Alright.

1813
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:49,600
We're having a sale!

1814
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:51,080
Guys!

1815
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,540
An oil sale!

1816
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:54,480
Grab your oils!

1817
01:06:57,530 --> 01:06:58,820
Never before seen!

1818
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:03,140
Such a deal.

1819
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,180
Never before seen!

1820
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,740
Never before seen oil sale before!

1821
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:09,900
Grab it before it's gone!

1822
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:15,980
Someone say oil?

1823
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:17,880
Nice.

1824
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:19,620
I'm glad this person...

1825
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:20,820
Oh, look at that.

1826
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:21,900
He heard about the sale.

1827
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:24,620
He heard about the oil sale.

1828
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:25,640
Good for you.

1829
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,880
Why is my water always too expensive?

1830
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:32,380
I don't understand.

1831
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,940
This is like, perfect.

1832
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:36,140
It's like, specifically priced water.

1833
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:37,560
Okay.

1834
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:38,900
$4.10.

1835
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,780
That's the lowest I'll go, with cheese.

1836
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,720
For my imported from France cheese.

1837
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:48,800
Alright, hello ma'am.

1838
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:50,900
Sliced bread.

1839
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:52,760
You don't deserve raw and sliced bread.

1840
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:54,180
You don't deserve.

1841
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:57,600
You can't- You don't deserve to be at my store and never come back!

1842
01:07:58,880 --> 01:07:59,340
Hello.

1843
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:01,400
Oh my god, he heard about the oil sale.

1844
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:04,160
So where did you hear about the oil sale?

1845
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:11,300
So, from your family, friends, website sponsors, Facebook...

1846
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,080
We don't need lighting!

1847
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:17,700
We don't need it!

1848
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:18,820
We're here to save money!

1849
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:22,420
We need to save money to make money!

1850
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:32,020
This is like an exclusive experience that you can only get at Half Foods.

1851
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:38,560
Whole Foods is wasting... Imagine all the electricity Whole Foods is wasting right now by turning on their lights.

1852
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:39,820
Oh my god!

1853
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:40,680
Guys!

1854
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:48,180
I told you!

1855
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:49,580
Tell your friends!

1856
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:51,260
Tell your friends!

1857
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:54,040
Our oil is one cent cheaper!

1858
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:55,160
Tell your friends!

1859
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:03,180
One cent is all it took.

1860
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,460
It truly is.

1861
01:09:06,940 --> 01:09:07,500
Oh, whoops.

1862
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:10,660
Ninety... Oh!

1863
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:12,260
There.

1864
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:12,780
Nice.

1865
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:13,340
We did it.

1866
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:15,100
I almost said...

1867
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:18,840
Hey!

1868
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:20,740
If it works, it works, guys!

1869
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:21,620
Look at that!

1870
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:23,680
And now look at that profit!

1871
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:26,360
A hundred and fourteen!

1872
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:29,780
I don't want to lose it.

1873
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:31,800
Oh, eggs are now...

1874
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,000
worse now.

1875
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:33,420
That's okay.

1876
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:34,520
We don't need eggs anyway.

1877
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:35,880
We need more oil.

1878
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:36,920
These are the eggs.

1879
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:38,940
This is the oil... This is the oil boom, guys.

1880
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:40,600
The oil boom.

1881
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:41,260
It's rising.

1882
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:44,420
Oh, back in you go.

1883
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:45,600
Twenty-two.

1884
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:46,280
We don't care!

1885
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:47,280
Those twenty-two people!

1886
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:48,460
They don't matter.

1887
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:55,540
We're here to build a customer base that can afford my products.

1888
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:00,140
Okay.

1889
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:00,940
Let's see.

1890
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:02,600
We're gonna grab...

1891
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:03,620
We're gonna grab some flour.

1892
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:05,120
Um...

1893
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:07,260
For the... I guess like the cereal.

1894
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,340
We love putting flour on the cereal.

1895
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:10,340
Alright.

1896
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:11,400
Let's put them up here.

1897
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:13,160
Alright.

1898
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:14,440
This should be good.

1899
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:16,820
And then we're gonna put that away.

1900
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:17,880
Alright.

1901
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:19,320
How much should the flour be?

1902
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:20,400
Okay.

1903
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:21,560
Five dollars.

1904
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:23,140
Is that good profit?

1905
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:24,700
That's a good profit.

1906
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:25,040
Okay.

1907
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:25,940
Four ninety-nine.

1908
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:28,020
Four point ninety-nine.

1909
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:28,980
There you go.

1910
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:30,440
There you go.

1911
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:31,700
So now you know it's a good...

1912
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:32,160
No, no!

1913
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:33,200
I'm gonna put five dollars!

1914
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:35,040
And then I'm gonna lower it to...

1915
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:37,620
And then I'm gonna lower it to four ninety-nine.

1916
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:39,820
So then they'll think it's a sale.

1917
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:47,840
They'll be like, damn that flour is too expensive.

1918
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:49,000
And I'll be like...

1919
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,520
I'll be like, oh my god!

1920
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:51,580
Good thing for you!

1921
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:53,720
We have a sale going on now.

1922
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:57,760
We have a sale going on.

1923
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:00,880
Now every flour is four ninety...

1924
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,860
Hey, if it worked for oil, it can work for flour.

1925
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:06,260
It's not mutually exclusive.

1926
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:10,880
Come.

1927
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:12,000
Come to my store.

1928
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:14,480
Uh, YT, thank you for the super chat.

1929
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:14,840
Thank you.

1930
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:15,160
Thank you.

1931
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:16,000
I'm an oil man.

1932
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:18,160
Don't keep playing with you.

1933
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:19,240
Thank you for the super chat.

1934
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:21,580
Ma'am, have you heard about our oil sale?

1935
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:23,040
Ma'am?

1936
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:25,900
Are you gonna buy the... We have zero purchases on the water.

1937
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:28,700
Ma'am, it's literally three ninety-nine!

1938
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:30,980
Don't you need all milk?

1939
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:33,100
Can I suggest you, um...

1940
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:37,080
People who buy the milk also bought the cereal.

1941
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,460
Would you like to have this in the cart?

1942
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:41,160
Ha ha ha ha!

1943
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:45,060
Ha ha ha ha!

1944
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:47,220
Um...

1945
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:49,540
So I was thinking for the super chat.

1946
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:50,040
Thank you.

1947
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:53,020
Welcome to the tomato... tomato farm.

1948
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:53,660
Welcome.

1949
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:54,280
Welcome.

1950
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:55,920
Forty...

1951
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,080
Four... Okay, no.

1952
01:11:58,220 --> 01:12:00,700
One, two, three, four, fifty...

1953
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:03,280
Amazon recommendation.

1954
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:06,000
Amazon and Uber Eats recommendation.

1955
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:08,540
Four point one.

1956
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:09,460
There we go.

1957
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,580
Gotta pay the bills later.

1958
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:13,760
Ma'am!

1959
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:15,360
Where you at?

1960
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:16,220
The cereal?

1961
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:18,120
Ma'am, you know what's cheaper?

1962
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:18,740
Milk.

1963
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:19,940
Would you like the milk?

1964
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:21,680
Oh, the cheese?

1965
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,220
Oh, you're a cheese girl.

1966
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,100
I see.

1967
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,800
What the fuck were you gonna do with cereal and cheese?

1968
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:27,800
I'll never know.

1969
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:29,040
Okay.

1970
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:30,200
Oh, and you play exact.

1971
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:32,400
You clearly only had budget for cheese.

1972
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:34,500
Uh, we need more cheese.

1973
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:36,200
It's working, guys.

1974
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:41,240
One day somebody will buy my water.

1975
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:43,640
Oh my god!

1976
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:44,360
It's working!

1977
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,180
It's the cheese boom!

1978
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:50,280
Yes, guys, you gotta... Quick, quick, guys!

1979
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:51,200
It's the cheese boom!

1980
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:55,700
Oil is yesterday's news.

1981
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:57,820
Today is all about the cheese.

1982
01:12:58,980 --> 01:12:59,820
Two dollar.

1983
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:02,720
Hello, sir.

1984
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:03,880
Milk?

1985
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:04,720
Okay.

1986
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:06,980
Okay, I need to...

1987
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:10,140
Guys, I've been holding onto this water for two days now.

1988
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,800
I don't understand why people do not want...

1989
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,700
Okay, what about 3.59?

1990
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:16,580
There we go.

1991
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:18,060
Someone's... Please!

1992
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:19,300
It's a basic necessity!

1993
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:21,760
Please purchase your water!

1994
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:23,940
Sir, are you gonna buy water?

1995
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:25,420
Please, why?

1996
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:25,960
Please!

1997
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,840
I know it's the cheese boom, sir!

1998
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,540
Why is water so too expensive?

1999
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:33,640
Fine!

2000
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:34,460
Three dollars!

2001
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,140
That's my final price.

2002
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:39,800
I can't believe it.

2003
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:42,540
Why has no one won my water?

2004
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:46,060
Water is... is like...

2005
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:48,200
Like, you don't need milk.

2006
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:55,040
Guys, you don't need cheese!

2007
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:56,620
You know?

2008
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:02,180
You don't need cheese!

2009
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:03,140
You don't need cheese!

2010
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:03,620
You don't need cheese!

2011
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:05,540
It's because of...

2012
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:06,680
No, not the sunny.

2013
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:07,120
No.

2014
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:09,420
Not the sunny cheese.

2015
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:10,700
Not the sunny water.

2016
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:12,720
One cent.

2017
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:13,400
Here you go.

2018
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:14,080
Water?

2019
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:14,940
Would you like...

2020
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:15,960
Oh my god!

2021
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,300
Wait, did he buy cheese?

2022
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:18,180
He bought cheese.

2023
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:19,400
Never mind.

2024
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:21,400
He did not... Guys, he did not buy water.

2025
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:24,360
He did not buy water.

2026
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:27,820
Okay, 20.9.

2027
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:28,200
One.

2028
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:29,180
Yay!

2029
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:31,480
We got 26 dollars!

2030
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:33,040
Wait, what am I gonna save for now?

2031
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:34,120
Okay.

2032
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:35,840
We can clearly buy...

2033
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:38,500
Um...

2034
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:39,860
Okay, I'm gonna...

2035
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:43,580
How much is... Okay, checkout counter, spotlight...

2036
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:45,820
Okay, I wanna be able to afford a cashier.

2037
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:47,940
Give me a sec!

2038
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,420
Oh my god!

2039
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:50,960
Can't you be patient?

2040
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:55,460
I'm trying to see if I can afford a...

2041
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:56,980
a worker.

2042
01:14:58,240 --> 01:14:58,720
Okay.

2043
01:14:58,720 --> 01:14:59,200
Okay.

2044
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:00,940
Biz 490.

2045
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,740
I need to be level 10?

2046
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:04,940
I'm just level 5!

2047
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:07,380
Okay, we need...

2048
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:08,500
Level 10?

2049
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:10,860
Okay, we can afford this.

2050
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:16,840
Warren, thank you for the super chat.

2051
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:17,160
Thank you.

2052
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:19,520
To be fair...

2053
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:22,800
You are a cheese skate for that price of water?

2054
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,980
This is reasonably priced water!

2055
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:26,680
Guys!

2056
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,060
I say as I...

2057
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:31,500
uncap my Fiji water right now...

2058
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:42,980
Thank you!

2059
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:48,040
Thank you!

2060
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:48,460
Oh!

2061
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:50,000
All I had to do...

2062
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,660
was drink Fiji water in front of my water fridge!

2063
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:56,620
That's all I had to do!

2064
01:15:58,740 --> 01:15:59,820
That's all I had to do!

2065
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:01,160
I figured it out!

2066
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:03,840
I figured it out!

2067
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:05,200
There you go.

2068
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:06,740
I figured it out.

2069
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:07,280
Guys!

2070
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:08,640
84.

2071
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:09,580
Okay.

2072
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:11,480
1, 2, 3, 4.

2073
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:13,160
1, 2.

2074
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:13,640
There you go.

2075
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:14,920
Okay, we need more.

2076
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:16,100
We need flour!

2077
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,200
Please give me a sec, ma'am!

2078
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:20,580
We need...

2079
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:21,120
flour!

2080
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:23,320
Pasta!

2081
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:24,960
Okay.

2082
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:27,320
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

2083
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:29,100
Okay, $21.

2084
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:31,100
Please!

2085
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,540
I need to...

2086
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:33,600
restock my store!

2087
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:35,080
Pasta!

2088
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:36,740
Pasta's good!

2089
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:38,000
I'm going off the shelves right now!

2090
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:41,520
We're making so much money off of pasta!

2091
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,040
And then flour.

2092
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:44,740
Alright.

2093
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:47,140
Nice, alright.

2094
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:48,540
Nice, alright.

2095
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:50,820
I'll never lower my prices.

2096
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:52,560
You can't make me.

2097
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:54,080
Except for water.

2098
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,500
I'll do that for wine!

2099
01:16:57,340 --> 01:17:00,780
Guys, my water has been in the store a little bit too long now.

2100
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:02,680
Okay, where's the card?

2101
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:03,740
Okay, grab the card.

2102
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:04,940
Hahaha!

2103
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:11,920
Guys, I will figure out how... I will have night vision soon.

2104
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:15,100
Eventually, I'll unlock night vision.

2105
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:18,340
No!

2106
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:20,980
I need to save money!

2107
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:22,240
Hahaha!

2108
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:27,860
I will never turn on the lights.

2109
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:32,620
My customers clearly are fine with it.

2110
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:33,600
They're fine.

2111
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:35,760
It's like immersive.

2112
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:41,020
Also, using your card for a purchase for $4 is dumb.

2113
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:44,740
Because there's hidden fees and stuff.

2114
01:17:46,610 --> 01:17:46,980
Hahaha!

2115
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:57,360
I don't like using my cards for stuff that's less than $10 because of the fees you can get from that.

2116
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:00,140
Nice!

2117
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:01,580
$182!

2118
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:04,040
$182!

2119
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:06,120
That's right.

2120
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:09,800
I know you guys were yelling at me to lower my prices.

2121
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:12,940
But look at the money I made from that.

2122
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:13,580
Oh, cheese.

2123
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:16,240
Cheese is flying off the shelves right now.

2124
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:19,340
Cheese, pasta, okay, we have enough.

2125
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:21,000
Alright, here you go.

2126
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:23,780
Uhhh... nice.

2127
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:27,320
Alright, cheese.

2128
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:29,200
Cheese!

2129
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:31,740
We don't need... oh wait.

2130
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:33,040
We can... uh...

2131
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:34,560
I can't throw.

2132
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,360
I'm gonna put the cheese here.

2133
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:37,480
We have enough oil.

2134
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:38,320
We need cereal.

2135
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:41,100
We need... we started off with cereal.

2136
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:44,340
Our cereal is our biggest money maker.

2137
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:45,560
Cereal and oil.

2138
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:46,820
Alright.

2139
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:48,240
Let's see.

2140
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:49,340
I think we're ready.

2141
01:18:49,780 --> 01:18:50,540
We're ready.

2142
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:52,580
No, I'm gonna order more pasta.

2143
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:54,580
Pasta's been doing well too.

2144
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:56,160
Pasta time.

2145
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:57,500
Oh my gosh.

2146
01:18:57,620 --> 01:18:59,120
I'm gonna make my first $1000.

2147
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:01,120
This is it, guys.

2148
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:02,720
Where were you when...

2149
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,520
Yuki made her first $1000.

2150
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:05,480
We're...

2151
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:10,360
Double...

2152
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:10,820
Thank you.

2153
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:16,040
Geez, the people that come in after sundown be struggling to see those shows.

2154
01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:16,780
That's good!

2155
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:19,440
That means they don't know what they're paying for.

2156
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:20,680
It's like a little game.

2157
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:23,800
It's like a little game, guys.

2158
01:19:23,940 --> 01:19:25,200
They don't know what they're paying for.

2159
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:26,620
So it's like more fun.

2160
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,660
It's... guys, it's more fun.

2161
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:31,700
It's like a...

2162
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:40,140
And like maybe they'll accidentally, you know, they'll accidentally pay... buy more than they actually wanted, you know?

2163
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:44,880
Alright, milk time.

2164
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,100
Okay, $7.98.

2165
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:47,960
There you go.

2166
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:50,040
How much should I...

2167
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:54,060
Okay, market is... okay, then that is $12.

2168
01:19:55,220 --> 01:19:55,780
Nice.

2169
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:56,260
Alright.

2170
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:57,760
Hello, ma'am.

2171
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,920

$85.

01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:07,120
There you go.

2176
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:08,120
That's fine.

2177
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,120
It's too expensive?

2178
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:11,840
It's literally at $5...

2179
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:12,260
Okay, wait.

2180
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:13,980

At least my milk and cheese is doing good.

2229
01:22:15,190 --> 01:22:16,450
At least my milk and cheese is doing good.

2230
01:22:16,450 --> 01:22:17,510
82 cents.

2231
01:22:18,070 --> 01:22:18,590
82 cents.

2232
01:22:18,970 --> 01:22:20,510
82 cents.

2233
01:22:22,090 --> 01:22:23,290
There you go.

2234
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:24,830
I eventually got there.

2235
01:22:25,270 --> 01:22:26,210
Oh, thank god.

2236
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:27,730
At least my water is doing great.

2237
01:22:29,170 --> 01:22:30,170
My water and cheese.

2238
01:22:30,170 --> 01:22:31,190
My water and cheese.

2239
01:22:32,870 --> 01:22:33,950
80 cents.

2240
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:37,260
Yeah.

2241
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:38,160
Yay!

2242
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:40,640
Oh, oil!

2243
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:43,040
The oil boom.

2244
01:22:45,170 --> 01:22:45,780
It's working.

2245
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:47,960
Okay.

2246
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:52,560
Alright, putting that away.

2247
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,100
Oh my god!

2248
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:57,080
I knew it!

2249
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:00,600
Sir, you look like a person that knows your coffee!

2250
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:01,880
Hahaha!

2251
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:02,180
Hahaha!

2252
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:06,980
You look like a man that loves coffee!

2253
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:08,320
My man!

2254
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:11,960
That's my man right there.

2255
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:14,120
Nice.

2256
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:15,600
Okay, we gotta get rid of that.

2257
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:17,180
And then...

2258
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:18,180
Cheese.

2259
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:20,720
Alright, putting that away.

2260
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:24,860
Sir, are you here for your cereal and water?

2261
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:25,980
Sir!

2262
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:28,900
You're one of those people.

2263
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:29,540
Hahaha!

2264
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,620
Cereal and water people.

2265
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:34,360
Oh no!

2266
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,720
He's one of them.

2267
01:23:37,940 --> 01:23:38,720
Okay.

2268
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:39,700
Let's see.

2269
01:23:41,410 --> 01:23:42,580
11.98.

2270
01:23:43,370 --> 01:23:43,760
Yay!

2271
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:45,180
Oh my god!

2272
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:46,880
We're actually running out of water for once!

2273
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:48,980
Cheese time.

2274
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:51,240
Alright, 4.1.

2275
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:53,280
Bread.

2276
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,020
89.

2277
01:23:58,020 --> 01:23:59,120
There you go.

2278
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:00,420
Okay, bread time.

2279
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:01,860
Wait, do we need more?

2280
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:02,520
What do we need more?

2281
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:04,040
Water, cheese.

2282
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:05,920
We always need water and cheese.

2283
01:24:06,260 --> 01:24:07,280
Water, cheese.

2284
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,640
Water, cheese.

2285
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:11,400
We'll order water and cheese first.

2286
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:13,080
And then...

2287
01:24:13,620 --> 01:24:14,780
Okay, cheese time.

2288
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:18,120
And then we'll put...

2289
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:20,220
Yeah, now I can put my cheese on the floor.

2290
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:21,160
That's okay!

2291
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:22,240
But, oh!

2292
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:26,000
Oh, I can't sell my cheese on the shelf?

2293
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:27,760
That's so dumb.

2294
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:32,200
No, I can be like...

2295
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:33,860
I can like not change my prices.

2296
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,800
And just be like 50% off.

2297
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:36,660
Guys!

2298
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:38,840
Everything is 50% off!

2299
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:41,000
From the original prices!

2300
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:42,880
Guys!

2301
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:43,340
Guys!

2302
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:47,720
I think I saw that in Apex.

2303
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:48,700
Where they did like...

2304
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:50,320
They did like a huge sale.

2305
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:51,960
And then they crossed the numbers out.

2306
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:53,060
And it was the same price.

2307
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:57,920
I could do that.

2308
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:01,540
This sale is gonna end...

2309
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:04,280
In 5 minutes and 30 seconds...

2310
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:05,980
If you don't act quick, guys!

2311
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:11,070
There you go.

2312
01:25:11,890 --> 01:25:13,010
Alright, water and milk.

2313
01:25:13,430 --> 01:25:14,610
Are you paying my cash?

2314
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:15,910
There you go.

2315
01:25:16,990 --> 01:25:18,230
Cheese is too expensive?

2316
01:25:18,570 --> 01:25:20,190
Everybody else liked my cheese.

2317
01:25:21,410 --> 01:25:23,950
You're the only person that didn't like the cheese.

2318
01:25:25,270 --> 01:25:27,130
Don't keep paying your bills.

2319
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:29,810
I don't need to pay my bills.

2320
01:25:30,610 --> 01:25:32,030
I need to pay my bills.

2321
01:25:39,230 --> 01:25:39,930
I need to pay my bills.

2322
01:25:39,930 --> 01:25:41,550
Thank you for the super chat.

2323
01:25:41,630 --> 01:25:41,890
Thank you.

2324
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:44,850
It would be even better if you don't show the price at all.

2325
01:25:44,910 --> 01:25:45,990
And randomize it as checkout.

2326
01:25:46,270 --> 01:25:48,630
Got your food to be an instant.

2327
01:25:52,070 --> 01:25:53,030
Oh my god.

2328
01:25:53,510 --> 01:25:53,910
Alright.

2329
01:25:55,310 --> 01:25:56,030
Where's the money?

2330
01:25:56,190 --> 01:25:57,330
Oh, there's your card.

2331
01:25:57,330 --> 01:25:57,510
Okay.

2332
01:25:57,770 --> 01:25:58,330
Sorry.

2333
01:25:58,650 --> 01:26:01,010
Sorry, my night vision hasn't kicked in yet.

2334
01:26:01,170 --> 01:26:01,550
Sorry.

2335
01:26:03,450 --> 01:26:04,010
Alright.

2336
01:26:04,890 --> 01:26:05,450
38...

2337
01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:08,750
8.50.

2338
01:26:08,810 --> 01:26:09,290
There you go.

2339
01:26:10,130 --> 01:26:11,050
One oil?

2340
01:26:11,150 --> 01:26:12,450
That's fine by me.

2341
01:26:12,590 --> 01:26:13,930
5.99.

2342
01:26:14,930 --> 01:26:15,490
Nice.

2343
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:16,490
Look at that.

2344
01:26:16,890 --> 01:26:18,010
We're doing so good.

2345
01:26:18,530 --> 01:26:19,250
Look at that.

2346
01:26:20,190 --> 01:26:21,750
The Genshin market.

2347
01:26:23,190 --> 01:26:24,830
Thank you for the super chat.

2348
01:26:24,830 --> 01:26:25,130
Thank you.

2349
01:26:25,130 --> 01:26:25,550
Thank you.

2350
01:26:25,550 --> 01:26:27,170
You have a cute laugh.

2351
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:27,950
Thank you.

2352
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:29,210
Thank you.

2353
01:26:29,210 --> 01:26:30,590
I'm glad you've been enjoying it.

2354
01:26:32,590 --> 01:26:33,430
$118 profit.

2355
01:26:34,090 --> 01:26:34,930
Look at that.

2356
01:26:35,170 --> 01:26:37,230
We're almost at $500.

2357
01:26:37,870 --> 01:26:39,010
Milk is up!

2358
01:26:39,810 --> 01:26:41,370
Milk and eggs are up!

2359
01:26:41,670 --> 01:26:42,210
Wait.

2360
01:26:42,910 --> 01:26:44,610
How do I do this?

2361
01:26:44,930 --> 01:26:46,050
Milk and...

2362
01:26:46,050 --> 01:26:46,270
Okay.

2363
01:26:46,430 --> 01:26:47,230
Unit price.

2364
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:48,310
Milk.

2365
01:26:48,410 --> 01:26:48,670
Okay.

2366
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:50,770
I can be more expensive with milk now.

2367
01:26:50,770 --> 01:26:51,430
Okay.

2368
01:26:51,570 --> 01:26:53,050
It went up by how much?

2369
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:54,250
How much did it go up by?

2370
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:55,670
1.20.

2371
01:26:55,930 --> 01:26:58,690
So that means I can technically sell.

2372
01:26:58,850 --> 01:27:00,230
Sell it for...

2373
01:27:00,770 --> 01:27:02,030
$4.99.

2374
01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:04,830
I sell for $4.99 now.

2375
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:05,650
Okay.

2376
01:27:05,690 --> 01:27:05,890
Good.

2377
01:27:06,010 --> 01:27:08,530
Now we need cereal and bread.

2378
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:09,090
Okay.

2379
01:27:09,710 --> 01:27:10,270
Cereal...

2380
01:27:10,270 --> 01:27:11,470
and bread.

2381
01:27:11,730 --> 01:27:13,670
Our OG money makers.

2382
01:27:14,110 --> 01:27:15,310
Oh my god.

2383
01:27:15,770 --> 01:27:17,370
Milk stocks are going up guys.

2384
01:27:17,910 --> 01:27:19,310
Where were you guys?

2385
01:27:20,770 --> 01:27:21,750
We're going to the moon!

2386
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:24,310
We're going to the moon!

2387
01:27:28,050 --> 01:27:29,630
I can't believe it.

2388
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:31,810
I can't believe the milk stock.

2389
01:27:32,110 --> 01:27:32,930
It's rising.

2390
01:27:33,950 --> 01:27:34,430
Okay.

2391
01:27:34,450 --> 01:27:35,450
Where's my cheese?

2392
01:27:35,770 --> 01:27:36,210
Okay.

2393
01:27:36,250 --> 01:27:37,770
Only one person bought my cheese.

2394
01:27:38,350 --> 01:27:38,830
Alright.

2395
01:27:38,910 --> 01:27:39,410
We're opening!

2396
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:40,470
Ding ding ding!

2397
01:27:41,390 --> 01:27:42,150
Open time!

2398
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:44,970
I'm saving up for a cashier right now.

2399
01:27:45,410 --> 01:27:45,890
Okay.

2400
01:27:45,930 --> 01:27:46,330
Let's see.

2401
01:27:46,450 --> 01:27:47,070
We can...

2402
01:27:47,070 --> 01:27:47,750
We can buy tea.

2403
01:27:48,670 --> 01:27:49,370
That's fine.

2404
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:51,550
Alright.

2405
01:27:51,710 --> 01:27:52,390
That's like...

2406
01:27:52,390 --> 01:27:53,690
Can we show down here, right?

2407
01:27:53,850 --> 01:27:54,070
Yeah.

2408
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:55,210
Tea next to the coffee.

2409
01:27:55,610 --> 01:27:56,630
That should make sense.

2410
01:27:57,850 --> 01:27:58,290
Nice.

2411
01:27:58,370 --> 01:27:58,670
Alright.

2412
01:27:59,690 --> 01:28:00,130
Tea...

2413
01:28:00,810 --> 01:28:01,650
And then...

2414
01:28:01,650 --> 01:28:03,550
We're going to make it $6.

2415
01:28:04,270 --> 01:28:05,150
$6.32.

2416
01:28:06,170 --> 01:28:06,610
$7.

2417
01:28:08,170 --> 01:28:08,610
$8.

2418
01:28:09,370 --> 01:28:09,810
$8.

2419
01:28:09,870 --> 01:28:10,370
Where's $8?

2420
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:10,830
$8.

2421
01:28:11,690 --> 01:28:12,430
There you go.

2422
01:28:12,450 --> 01:28:13,290
$4.99 profit.

2423
01:28:13,430 --> 01:28:13,770
There you go.

2424
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:14,790
That should be good profit.

2425
01:28:15,330 --> 01:28:16,010
We're open!

2426
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:18,770
I am here to...

2427
01:28:18,770 --> 01:28:18,970
Wait.

2428
01:28:19,050 --> 01:28:20,350
Can I like explore the place?

2429
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:22,850
Oh, I can.

2430
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:23,830
But I shouldn't.

2431
01:28:25,790 --> 01:28:26,230
No!

2432
01:28:26,550 --> 01:28:26,990
Please!

2433
01:28:27,090 --> 01:28:27,550
I'm sorry!

2434
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:29,670
I shouldn't explore.

2435
01:28:29,770 --> 01:28:30,970
We don't have a cashier.

2436
01:28:33,390 --> 01:28:33,830
Nice.

2437
01:28:34,410 --> 01:28:35,030
Thank you.

2438
01:28:37,350 --> 01:28:38,230
$5.99.

2439
01:28:38,490 --> 01:28:40,990
Thank you, sir, for supporting your local business.

2440
01:28:41,630 --> 01:28:42,230
Thank you.

2441
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:42,790
More balls!

2442
01:28:42,910 --> 01:28:44,290
Thank you for the 20 gift-a-shifts!

2443
01:28:44,430 --> 01:28:44,670
Thank you!

2444
01:28:45,810 --> 01:28:46,830
Ma'am, are you here?

2445
01:28:46,990 --> 01:28:47,970
Oh my god!

2446
01:28:47,970 --> 01:28:50,690
You have a big family, ma'am!

2447
01:28:51,130 --> 01:28:51,690
Oh!

2448
01:28:52,750 --> 01:28:53,650
Thank you.

2449
01:28:54,150 --> 01:28:54,890
Thank you.

2450
01:28:55,030 --> 01:28:55,750
The store...

2451
01:28:55,750 --> 01:28:58,030
The store is happy for your service.

2452
01:28:58,570 --> 01:28:59,590
Oh my god!

2453
01:28:59,890 --> 01:29:00,670
Pasta night?

2454
01:29:00,850 --> 01:29:02,510
Is it pasta night tonight for you?

2455
01:29:03,170 --> 01:29:03,730
Okay.

2456
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:04,350
Let's see.

2457
01:29:04,770 --> 01:29:05,330
$4.

2458
01:29:07,150 --> 01:29:07,710
$3.

2459
01:29:08,330 --> 01:29:08,970
Ma'am.

2460
01:29:09,930 --> 01:29:10,590
Let's see.

2461
01:29:10,690 --> 01:29:11,030
Milk!

2462
01:29:11,230 --> 01:29:11,450
Oh!

2463
01:29:11,530 --> 01:29:12,810
You heard about the milk boom!

2464
01:29:13,530 --> 01:29:14,290
Don't worry.

2465
01:29:14,370 --> 01:29:18,470
Our cows are all raised at a nice, humane farm.

2466
01:29:20,170 --> 01:29:20,730
We...

2467
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:24,130
We make sure... We make sure they're fed premium grass!

2468
01:29:24,830 --> 01:29:27,810
That's why... That's why the milk boom is going up!

2469
01:29:28,750 --> 01:29:29,410
Let's see.

2470
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:30,210
Oil... Oh!

2471
01:29:30,230 --> 01:29:31,070
We're running out of coffee.

2472
01:29:31,350 --> 01:29:33,410
We're running out of coffee for the businessmen.

2473
01:29:34,210 --> 01:29:34,770
Okay.

2474
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:35,330
Coffee.

2475
01:29:36,130 --> 01:29:38,990
This is some expensive fucking coffee, but it's okay.

2476
01:29:40,990 --> 01:29:41,990
Our cows!

2477
01:29:42,670 --> 01:29:44,510
Our cows live the good life!

2478
01:29:44,710 --> 01:29:45,530
Okay, guys?

2479
01:29:46,630 --> 01:29:47,370
We have good cows!

2480
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:50,330
Oh, ma'am!

2481
01:29:50,330 --> 01:29:51,730
Thank you for taking that water.

2482
01:29:51,850 --> 01:29:52,910
Now I can stock this.

2483
01:29:54,610 --> 01:29:55,010
Alright.

2484
01:29:55,010 --> 01:29:56,430
Just one bottle of water?

2485
01:29:56,490 --> 01:29:57,150
No problem.

2486
01:29:57,970 --> 01:29:58,370
$47?

2487
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:00,650
What the fuck are you doing with your life?

2488
01:30:01,070 --> 01:30:01,470
Alright.

2489
01:30:01,650 --> 01:30:02,630
$20... $25...

2490
01:30:03,950 --> 01:30:04,650
There you go.

2491
01:30:04,710 --> 01:30:06,530
At least I don't have to... Oh my god!

2492
01:30:06,550 --> 01:30:07,770
That's a lot of caffeine there!

2493
01:30:08,170 --> 01:30:08,990
Sir, are you okay?

2494
01:30:09,550 --> 01:30:10,470
Is your life okay?

2495
01:30:10,790 --> 01:30:12,110
Are you going through some crunch work?

2496
01:30:13,470 --> 01:30:14,250
It's too... Oh!

2497
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:16,130
You can afford the coffee, but not the tea?

2498
01:30:16,630 --> 01:30:17,790
I see how it is.

2499
01:30:18,990 --> 01:30:20,310
Cooking is a hobby.

2500
01:30:20,730 --> 01:30:21,310
Okay?

2501
01:30:21,470 --> 01:30:22,050
Baking.

2502
01:30:22,090 --> 01:30:22,550
Sorry, not cooking.

2503
01:30:22,650 --> 01:30:24,950
Baking is a nice hobby.

2504
01:30:25,330 --> 01:30:27,910
You can't afford baking.

2505
01:30:29,190 --> 01:30:31,470
Because you have no joy in your life.

2506
01:30:31,810 --> 01:30:36,170
If you love having joy, you would invest in baking.

2507
01:30:37,750 --> 01:30:40,310
Also, thank you for shopping at Half Foods.

2508
01:30:44,650 --> 01:30:45,750
Please come again.

2509
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:49,870
Please.

2510
01:30:50,290 --> 01:30:51,390
Please come again.

2511
01:30:53,290 --> 01:30:53,850
Alright.

2512
01:30:53,910 --> 01:30:54,370
Here you go.

2513
01:30:54,810 --> 01:30:56,190
What was that?

2514
01:30:56,510 --> 01:30:57,850
Sorry, I meant baking.

2515
01:30:58,090 --> 01:30:59,730
Cooking is a good skill.

2516
01:30:59,950 --> 01:31:00,310
Dad!

2517
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:09,730
The clerk that would avoid at all costs.

2518
01:31:10,310 --> 01:31:11,290
You can't avoid me!

2519
01:31:11,530 --> 01:31:12,430
I'm the manager!

2520
01:31:14,910 --> 01:31:15,950
It's too bad!

2521
01:31:16,150 --> 01:31:17,270
I run this store.

2522
01:31:18,110 --> 01:31:19,530
You know what you're getting.

2523
01:31:20,810 --> 01:31:22,430
The milk is too expensive?

2524
01:31:23,310 --> 01:31:26,030
Have you not heard about the milk boom?

2525
01:31:26,330 --> 01:31:28,670
Have you not heard about the milk boom?

2526
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:30,450
I'm joking.

2527
01:31:33,690 --> 01:31:34,650
Alright, nice.

2528
01:31:36,150 --> 01:31:38,550
How are you going to make pasta without the milk?

2529
01:31:38,550 --> 01:31:40,610
What about the cream sauce?

2530
01:31:41,630 --> 01:31:42,150
Oil.

2531
01:31:42,370 --> 01:31:42,850
Oil.

2532
01:31:43,090 --> 01:31:44,010
My biggest.

2533
01:31:44,370 --> 01:31:46,090
Oil, you'll never fail me.

2534
01:31:46,130 --> 01:31:47,670
You'll never disappoint me, oil.

2535
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:51,090
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

2536
01:31:51,090 --> 01:31:52,150
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

2537
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:57,730
Don't regret the day when Half Foods become two-thirds goods.

2538
01:32:03,550 --> 01:32:04,810
Don't regret it.

2539
01:32:05,330 --> 01:32:07,530
Don't regret pissing me off!

2540
01:32:10,410 --> 01:32:12,030
Alright, Sir, thank you.

2541
01:32:12,030 --> 01:32:13,930
Thank you for shopping at Half Foods.

2542
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:22,370
27.50 27.50 Oh, ma'am, would you like a little discount?

2543
01:32:22,670 --> 01:32:24,350
We're having a sale right now.

2544
01:32:25,130 --> 01:32:26,410
0% off.

2545
01:32:26,710 --> 01:32:27,490
Don't worry.

2546
01:32:28,290 --> 01:32:29,990
Oh, would you all join the membership?

2547
01:32:30,390 --> 01:32:32,070
I forgot about the membership!

2548
01:32:32,650 --> 01:32:33,550
Ma'am!

2549
01:32:34,750 --> 01:32:36,070
To collect points!

2550
01:32:36,890 --> 01:32:38,970
Every purchase you get, one point!

2551
01:32:39,310 --> 01:32:41,070
It doesn't matter how much you buy!

2552
01:32:44,450 --> 01:32:48,210
If you raise enough points, you get a shopping bag!

2553
01:32:50,210 --> 01:32:52,010
What about donations?

2554
01:32:52,430 --> 01:32:53,550
The doki points!

2555
01:32:54,050 --> 01:32:55,090
Wait, what was on top?

2556
01:32:55,130 --> 01:32:55,530
Was it flour?

2557
01:32:55,870 --> 01:32:57,690
Oh my god, we finally ran out of flour.

2558
01:32:58,270 --> 01:33:01,710
It took so long because my flour is a little bit overpriced.

2559
01:33:01,790 --> 01:33:03,110
But just a little bit.

2560
01:33:03,150 --> 01:33:03,750
It's worth it.

2561
01:33:03,770 --> 01:33:05,270
If you love to cook, it's worth it.

2562
01:33:07,270 --> 01:33:08,870
You love to bake, I mean.

2563
01:33:09,270 --> 01:33:10,430
Alright, nice.

2564
01:33:11,690 --> 01:33:13,290
100.00 Exactly!

2565
01:33:14,170 --> 01:33:19,630
If you get 100 points, you get 0.01 discount.

2566
01:33:21,490 --> 01:33:22,450
Let's see.

2567
01:33:24,290 --> 01:33:24,930
92.

2568
01:33:25,050 --> 01:33:25,530
Alright.

2569
01:33:25,810 --> 01:33:26,450
Coffee!

2570
01:33:28,530 --> 01:33:30,570
This woman needs it.

2571
01:33:31,150 --> 01:33:32,410
It's too expensive.

2572
01:33:33,010 --> 01:33:33,390
What?

2573
01:33:33,430 --> 01:33:33,990
You're gonna have oil?

2574
01:33:34,190 --> 01:33:35,250
You're gonna hurt yourself!

2575
01:33:35,270 --> 01:33:38,630
The food is gonna stick to your pan if you don't buy my oil!

2576
01:33:39,450 --> 01:33:39,930
Alright.

2577
01:33:40,370 --> 01:33:43,810
16.18 Thank you.

2578
01:33:43,970 --> 01:33:50,630
Ma'am, would you like to kindly donate $5 to the charity for dogs?

2579
01:33:52,290 --> 01:33:53,250
Would you, ma'am?

2580
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:54,790
Also, would you like to join our membership?

2581
01:33:56,750 --> 01:34:00,810
Each point, each purchase equals one point.

2582
01:34:01,170 --> 01:34:05,550
And when you collect a thousand points, you can have a 0.1 discount!

2583
01:34:07,130 --> 01:34:10,550
I don't think she wants to join my membership, guys.

2584
01:34:10,970 --> 01:34:11,710
I don't...

2585
01:34:14,130 --> 01:34:14,990
Don't forget!

2586
01:34:16,090 --> 01:34:18,030
Sir, would you like to like...

2587
01:34:18,890 --> 01:34:22,610
Would you like to give some money in the tip jar, sir?

2588
01:34:26,090 --> 01:34:28,650
Our shopkeepers are paid by tips only.

2589
01:34:29,730 --> 01:34:31,110
I'm the only employee.

2590
01:34:36,370 --> 01:34:37,190
Are you...

2591
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:40,430
TG, thank you for the super chat.

2592
01:34:40,510 --> 01:34:40,850
Thank you.

2593
01:34:41,970 --> 01:34:47,890
Are you willing to round your spend to $10 to help your local tomato farm?

2594
01:34:48,130 --> 01:34:49,590
Sir, would you like to do that?

2595
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:51,550
Would you like to round your purchase up?

2596
01:34:53,390 --> 01:34:56,230
Would you like to round your purchase up to $20?

2597
01:34:56,810 --> 01:34:58,470
To help your local doki?

2598
01:34:59,350 --> 01:35:01,350
It's only $5 more.

2599
01:35:03,850 --> 01:35:05,010
Didn't think of the super chat.

2600
01:35:05,270 --> 01:35:05,750
TG, thank you.

2601
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:09,090
I'm surprised none of the boxes outside gets stolen.

2602
01:35:09,270 --> 01:35:10,830
Cause I will know where they live.

2603
01:35:13,550 --> 01:35:18,810
They know I'm crazy cause I open right next to the Whole Foods down the lane.

2604
01:35:20,570 --> 01:35:27,350
They don't want to piss off the manager that opened a competing store that's more expensive than Whole Foods.

2605
01:35:28,970 --> 01:35:30,010
Alright, nice.

2606
01:35:30,310 --> 01:35:31,010
Okay, card.

2607
01:35:31,110 --> 01:35:33,990
22.47 Did I run out of cheese?

2608
01:35:34,290 --> 01:35:36,070
I can't tell cause it's dark.

2609
01:35:37,610 --> 01:35:39,310
But it saves money.

2610
01:35:41,410 --> 01:35:42,870
No, at the close?

2611
01:35:43,390 --> 01:35:44,570
Wait, is there anybody here?

2612
01:35:44,710 --> 01:35:45,230
I can't tell.

2613
01:35:45,310 --> 01:35:46,230
There's nobody here, right?

2614
01:35:46,510 --> 01:35:47,790
Yeah, there's nobody here.

2615
01:35:50,370 --> 01:35:50,890
Sorry.

2616
01:35:51,130 --> 01:35:54,870
I'm like a blind moron.

2617
01:35:55,130 --> 01:35:58,210
I have to touch everything to know if anybody's here.

2618
01:35:58,490 --> 01:36:01,450
Okay, we need cheese and milk.

2619
01:36:02,810 --> 01:36:04,530
Oh, there's a cheese boom!

2620
01:36:06,310 --> 01:36:07,750
Oh my god.

2621
01:36:08,250 --> 01:36:10,450
The cheese boom market is here.

2622
01:36:10,790 --> 01:36:13,490
This is everything I've been waiting for.

2623
01:36:13,670 --> 01:36:15,950
I knew it was gonna show up!

2624
01:36:16,990 --> 01:36:18,230
The cheese boom!

2625
01:36:18,370 --> 01:36:19,970
We've been preparing for this, guys!

2626
01:36:22,510 --> 01:36:24,990
We've been preparing for this right moment!

2627
01:36:26,290 --> 01:36:28,170
Just put the milk here for now.

2628
01:36:28,390 --> 01:36:31,390
And then make sure this box of milk doesn't spoil.

2629
01:36:32,090 --> 01:36:33,210
The cheese boom!

2630
01:36:36,530 --> 01:36:37,590
What is the boom?

2631
01:36:37,650 --> 01:36:38,830
Did I buy more cheese?

2632
01:36:39,610 --> 01:36:42,210
I bought- I accidentally bought more cheese, but it's okay!

2633
01:36:42,730 --> 01:36:44,210
We're prepared for the boom!

2634
01:36:45,610 --> 01:36:46,090
Okay.

2635
01:36:46,090 --> 01:36:47,430
What- how much is cheese?

2636
01:36:47,710 --> 01:36:49,150
2.15?

2637
01:36:50,030 --> 01:36:51,030
What was it before?

2638
01:36:52,470 --> 01:36:53,770
Wait, what was it before?

2639
01:36:54,930 --> 01:36:56,690
How much did it go up by?

2640
01:36:57,890 --> 01:36:58,370
Guys!

2641
01:36:58,870 --> 01:37:00,650
How much did the cheese go up by?

2642
01:37:01,650 --> 01:37:08,350
Hahahaha Hahahaha I don't- I don't remember!

2643
01:37:11,770 --> 01:37:12,570
Guys!

2644
01:37:13,070 --> 01:37:17,790
Hahahaha The market price was- oh!

2645
01:37:18,210 --> 01:37:19,330
4 point- Okay.

2646
01:37:19,490 --> 01:37:23,630
Then it'd be- It should be 5 then.

2647
01:37:23,850 --> 01:37:24,490
Okay.

2648
01:37:24,990 --> 01:37:25,390
5.

2649
01:37:25,790 --> 01:37:26,250
Right?

2650
01:37:26,370 --> 01:37:26,570
No!

2651
01:37:26,730 --> 01:37:27,250
6.

2652
01:37:28,990 --> 01:37:29,390
Yeah.

2653
01:37:29,530 --> 01:37:30,850
That sounds right.

2654
01:37:31,550 --> 01:37:36,430
Hahahaha That sounds right.

2655
01:37:36,550 --> 01:37:36,970
$6.00.

2656
01:37:37,210 --> 01:37:37,630
Cheese.

2657
01:37:38,410 --> 01:37:38,810
Cranberry!

2658
01:37:38,950 --> 01:37:39,770
Thank you for the super chat!

2659
01:37:39,870 --> 01:37:40,090
Thank you!

2660
01:37:40,130 --> 01:37:40,590
Thank you!

2661
01:37:40,590 --> 01:37:44,410
To be honest, working for Target, they still made us work in the dark when power was out.

2662
01:37:44,490 --> 01:37:47,330
And the heat in the heat when our AC went out with no water.

2663
01:37:47,550 --> 01:37:48,750
Doki is a great boss.

2664
01:37:48,850 --> 01:37:50,050
Oh my god!

2665
01:37:50,270 --> 01:37:52,190
Thank god for reminding me!

2666
01:37:52,230 --> 01:37:53,990
It's time to turn off the heat as well!

2667
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:57,670
You don't need heat at night!

2668
01:37:58,190 --> 01:37:58,590
Guys!

2669
01:37:58,650 --> 01:37:59,950
Just open the door!

2670
01:38:01,010 --> 01:38:04,030
Hahahaha The- the wind!

2671
01:38:04,690 --> 01:38:06,450
The- we don't need heat!

2672
01:38:07,210 --> 01:38:08,310
Because we can close the door!

2673
01:38:08,590 --> 01:38:11,490
If it's very humid, we can open the door at night!

2674
01:38:11,950 --> 01:38:13,910
Hahahaha Or!

2675
01:38:14,270 --> 01:38:15,150
Wait, no no no!

2676
01:38:15,190 --> 01:38:21,030
Okay, if it's hot, if it's too hot, we open the door so it's cooler with the wind coming in.

2677
01:38:21,170 --> 01:38:22,230
If it's winter!

2678
01:38:22,750 --> 01:38:32,370
If it's winter, we close the door and like just make sure we don't open the door so the heat will stay in.

2679
01:38:32,930 --> 01:38:37,110
And then we- if it's like too hot, we don't need AC.

2680
01:38:37,210 --> 01:38:38,490
We just keep the door open.

2681
01:38:39,090 --> 01:38:41,010
And then like, um...

2682
01:38:41,010 --> 01:38:43,310
at night time, we just keep the door open still.

2683
01:38:43,930 --> 01:38:49,690
Hahahaha Hahahaha Hahahaha This is it.

2684
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:51,090
This is- this is genius.

2685
01:38:51,670 --> 01:38:52,930
Okay, we gotta...

2686
01:38:53,830 --> 01:38:55,410
We gotta buy sugar.

2687
01:38:55,630 --> 01:38:56,410
We don't have sugar yet.

2688
01:38:56,750 --> 01:38:57,810
Alright, sugar time.

2689
01:39:00,650 --> 01:39:01,710
Just bundle up!

2690
01:39:01,770 --> 01:39:02,910
We'll give you guys jackets!

2691
01:39:03,070 --> 01:39:04,870
Just come into work with more clothes on!

2692
01:39:04,870 --> 01:39:07,050
If you're too- too cold.

2693
01:39:08,110 --> 01:39:08,830
Guys!

2694
01:39:09,250 --> 01:39:11,270
We are a business!

2695
01:39:11,630 --> 01:39:14,270
We wanna grow the business, guys.

2696
01:39:14,570 --> 01:39:16,290
We're here to grow the business.

2697
01:39:17,070 --> 01:39:18,130
Okay, six.

2698
01:39:19,930 --> 01:39:20,650
Yeah.

2699
01:39:21,010 --> 01:39:23,070
We're here to grow our business!

2700
01:39:23,530 --> 01:39:25,570
We need to make sacrifices!

2701
01:39:26,670 --> 01:39:34,050
Hahahaha Hahahaha Guys, it's all about sacrifice.

2702
01:39:35,130 --> 01:39:37,310
Do you not love half foods?

2703
01:39:37,990 --> 01:39:40,010
Do you want Target to win?

2704
01:39:40,890 --> 01:39:46,230
Hahahaha Hahahaha Alex, thank you for the super chat.

Thank you.

2707
01:39:47,310 --> 01:39:48,890
One cheese, please.

2708
01:39:49,330 --> 01:39:51,430
Guys, I can't believe it.

2709
01:39:51,550 --> 01:39:54,190
You are willing to let Target win.

2710
01:39:55,410 --> 01:40:02,090
Hahahaha Hahahaha Hahahaha Oh my god.

2711
01:40:03,710 --> 01:40:05,390
Guys, you don't want that...

2712
01:40:06,550 --> 01:40:10,310
I also don't even know if there's been like... if you guys can even hear the sound.

2713
01:40:12,210 --> 01:40:15,550
Have you guys been able to hear the sound this entire time?

2714
01:40:15,950 --> 01:40:18,490
The sound of me restocking?

2715
01:40:20,170 --> 01:40:20,670
Okay...

2716
01:40:21,490 --> 01:40:21,990
No?

2717
01:40:22,250 --> 01:40:24,390
You don't hear the So I've been playing?

2718
01:40:24,530 --> 01:40:26,430
Yes, it has sound!

2719
01:40:27,270 --> 01:40:27,770
Okay!

2720
01:40:29,230 --> 01:40:29,970
Oh, shit.

2721
01:40:30,050 --> 01:40:32,250
I almost charged this lady $138.

2722
01:40:32,910 --> 01:40:33,810
Yes, guys.

2723
01:40:33,910 --> 01:40:34,770
This has sound!

2724
01:40:34,870 --> 01:40:38,290
Okay, let me turn up the sound real quick.

2725
01:40:44,110 --> 01:40:47,050
Okay guys, let's have like supermarket music in.

2726
01:40:47,210 --> 01:40:49,510
To be more... you know what, you're right.

2727
01:40:49,590 --> 01:40:51,170
We need supermarket music.

2728
01:40:51,310 --> 01:40:54,370
We need to be more immersed in our supermarket.

2729
01:40:56,190 --> 01:40:57,310
Supermarket music.

2730
01:40:57,990 --> 01:40:58,790
There we go.

2731
01:41:00,170 --> 01:41:02,550
More sounds of the department store.

2732
01:41:03,170 --> 01:41:04,270
Alright, what is this?

2733
01:41:06,650 --> 01:41:07,530
Oh, there we go.

2734
01:41:07,610 --> 01:41:08,210
Yeah, it's fine.

2735
01:41:08,370 --> 01:41:10,290
I can get fucking copyright claimed again.

2736
01:41:13,550 --> 01:41:18,490
There we go.

2737
01:41:18,670 --> 01:41:21,410
I got copyright claimed for playing Eva Maria.

2738
01:41:28,670 --> 01:41:29,430
That's fine.

2739
01:41:30,750 --> 01:41:31,510
Here we go.

2740
01:41:32,690 --> 01:41:34,970
Does it sound like we're in the supermarket now?

2741
01:41:36,210 --> 01:41:36,770
Actually, no.

2742
01:41:36,830 --> 01:41:37,350
Maybe not.

2743
01:41:37,430 --> 01:41:38,950
Maybe that's not a good idea.

2744
01:41:41,890 --> 01:41:43,130
Okay, okay.

2745
01:41:43,690 --> 01:41:46,210
Supermarket copyright free.

2746
01:41:47,790 --> 01:41:49,790
The church got me, by the way.

2747
01:41:50,030 --> 01:41:52,730
Yes, the church actually got me.

2748
01:41:54,390 --> 01:41:58,170
They had Jesus actually copyright claim me.

2749
01:41:58,430 --> 01:41:59,210
Oh, there we go.

2750
01:42:01,530 --> 01:42:02,230
There we go.

2751
01:42:02,330 --> 01:42:03,170

2752
01:42:04,590 --> 01:42:05,710
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

2753
01:42:06,710 --> 01:42:08,350
Listen on repeat.

2754
01:42:08,530 --> 01:42:10,510
People are gonna go crazy, but it's fine.

2755
01:42:10,690 --> 01:42:12,130
We're gonna listen to this on repeat.

2756
01:42:16,990 --> 01:42:20,690
We're gonna listen to this on repeat, chat.

2757

01:42:23,410 --> 01:42:23,930
Alright.

2759
01:42:25,090 --> 01:42:25,870
Here we go.

2760
01:42:28,470 --> 01:42:29,270
There we go.

2761
01:42:30,430 --> 01:42:31,250
Is this good?

2762
01:42:32,150 --> 01:42:32,670
Okay.

2763
01:42:32,990 --> 01:42:33,510
Okay.

2764
01:42:34,370 --> 01:42:34,470
Okay.

2765
01:42:38,810 --> 01:42:39,650
There we go.

2766
01:42:39,850 --> 01:42:40,510
There we go.

2767
01:42:40,510 --> 01:42:40,830
Hello.

2768
01:42:40,830 --> 01:42:40,970
Welcome.

2769
01:42:41,330 --> 01:42:42,710
Welcome to half foods.

2770
01:42:43,650 --> 01:42:45,690
It feels like we're actually at the supermarket.

2771
01:42:47,510 --> 01:42:50,690
Guys, are you not excited?

2772
01:42:50,950 --> 01:42:52,090
We get to listen to this.

2773
01:42:55,150 --> 01:42:55,670
Yeah!

2774
01:42:56,250 --> 01:42:57,350
That's the stuff.

2775
01:42:58,330 --> 01:43:00,930
That's the supermarket we've been waiting for.

2776
01:43:02,090 --> 01:43:04,450
No, I'm so immersed right now.

2777
01:43:04,450 --> 01:43:06,310
Wait, did I not price the milk?

2778
01:43:06,950 --> 01:43:07,870
No, that's fine.

2779
01:43:08,050 --> 01:43:09,530
The milk prices is fine.

2780
01:43:09,770 --> 01:43:10,910
Okay, maybe not.

2781
01:43:11,090 --> 01:43:12,050
Okay, maybe...

2782
01:43:12,050 --> 01:43:13,390
4.50.

2783
01:43:13,510 --> 01:43:14,530
That's the lowest I'll go.

2784
01:43:16,430 --> 01:43:17,970
Now we're cooking here.

2785
01:43:18,390 --> 01:43:20,150
Now we're actually...

2786
01:43:20,150 --> 01:43:21,570
What do you mean it's too expensive?

2787
01:43:21,750 --> 01:43:22,570
It's the cheese!

2788
01:43:22,730 --> 01:43:23,210
Boom!

2789
01:43:24,510 --> 01:43:25,870
Okay, 5.50.

2790
01:43:25,890 --> 01:43:26,790
That's the lowest I'll...

2791
01:43:27,450 --> 01:43:28,150
I'll go.

2792
01:43:30,190 --> 01:43:30,670
Welcome.

2793
01:43:30,670 --> 01:43:33,990
I hope you enjoy your experiences here.

2794
01:43:34,290 --> 01:43:35,770
Okay, we need to sell...

2795
01:43:35,770 --> 01:43:36,670
We need to sell...

2796
01:43:38,530 --> 01:43:41,330
This man has my entire flower stock now.

2797
01:43:42,290 --> 01:43:44,530
This man has my entire flower stock now.

2798
01:43:44,530 --> 01:43:46,930
I need to fucking stock this up.

2799
01:43:53,990 --> 01:43:56,150
This is the best supermarket!

2800
01:43:56,430 --> 01:43:58,210
Your children cannot get lost here!

2801
01:43:58,710 --> 01:43:59,770
Do not worry!

2802
01:44:00,910 --> 01:44:01,570
Oh, no!

2803
01:44:01,570 --> 01:44:03,030
Granberry, thank you for the super chat!

2804
01:44:03,090 --> 01:44:04,090
Thank you, thank you!

2805
01:44:04,870 --> 01:44:07,170
I can't handle the no heat AC!

2806
01:44:07,370 --> 01:44:08,710
I can handle the darkness!

2807
01:44:08,850 --> 01:44:11,590
But this music is gonna make me go on strike!

2808
01:44:11,890 --> 01:44:13,530
I can't take it!

2809
01:44:13,690 --> 01:44:14,930
Thank you for the super chat!

2810
01:44:15,030 --> 01:44:15,930
Thank you, thank you!

2811
01:44:16,150 --> 01:44:17,170
Oh, we need coffee.

2812
01:44:18,170 --> 01:44:20,850
Now we're gonna listen to this for an hour straight.

2813
01:44:25,370 --> 01:44:27,330
No, this is reasonably priced milk!

2814
01:44:27,330 --> 01:44:29,110
You can't make me lower my milk cost!

2815
01:44:37,090 --> 01:44:37,930
Alright,

2816
01:44:42,070 --> 01:44:42,730
our goal...

2817
01:44:42,730 --> 01:44:44,090
Our goal, guys...

2818
01:44:44,090 --> 01:44:45,810
is to get level 10!

2819
01:44:46,110 --> 01:44:47,430
And hire...

2820
01:44:47,430 --> 01:44:49,090
a minimum wage worker!

2821
01:44:49,910 --> 01:44:51,310
To work here forever!

2822
01:44:51,830 --> 01:44:55,050
And listen to this every single day!

2823
01:45:03,570 --> 01:45:05,310
That is my goal.

2824
01:45:05,510 --> 01:45:08,410
I need to hire a minimum wage worker.

2825
01:45:08,790 --> 01:45:11,730
To stand here for the rest of their life!

2826
01:45:12,410 --> 01:45:14,610
And listen to this two minute repeat.

2827
01:45:15,010 --> 01:45:18,130
The worst part is that it's like two minutes repeat too.

2828
01:45:18,210 --> 01:45:20,150
That's the worst part of it all.

2829
01:45:20,470 --> 01:45:21,470
It's not like...

2830
01:45:21,470 --> 01:45:22,870
There's no variety.

2831
01:45:23,130 --> 01:45:24,510
It's literally two minutes long.

2832
01:45:24,710 --> 01:45:26,150
And it's just going on repeat.

2833
01:45:26,590 --> 01:45:27,310
I hate this.

2834
01:45:27,330 --> 01:45:28,150
I'm so dead.

2835
01:45:28,350 --> 01:45:29,750
Welcome to hell.

2836
01:45:31,110 --> 01:45:34,870
Okay, 14.49.

2837
01:45:35,230 --> 01:45:35,950
Nice.

2838
01:45:37,150 --> 01:45:38,710
Guys, what happened?

2839
01:45:38,910 --> 01:45:40,430
Why do you not wanna...

2840
01:45:40,430 --> 01:45:41,410
find cheese?

2841
01:45:42,350 --> 01:45:43,850
It's the cheese boom!

2842
01:45:44,550 --> 01:45:46,450
The cheese boom!

2843
01:45:50,590 --> 01:45:52,410
Thank you for the super chat.

2844
01:45:52,490 --> 01:45:52,770
Thank you.

2845
01:45:52,830 --> 01:45:53,290
Thank you.

2846
01:45:53,490 --> 01:45:56,410
Kaz, a trip to hell was never this cheap.

2847
01:45:56,410 --> 01:45:57,450
Only at...

2848
01:45:57,450 --> 01:45:58,010
Hello?

2849
01:45:58,050 --> 01:45:59,070
It is Half Foods.

2850
01:45:59,090 --> 01:46:00,190
Not Doki Marts.

2851
01:46:00,190 --> 01:46:01,470
Doki Marts is down the street.

2852
01:46:01,730 --> 01:46:03,330
It's my second business venture.

2853
01:46:06,930 --> 01:46:07,570
Hello?

2854
01:46:08,010 --> 01:46:08,510
Sir?

2855
01:46:08,750 --> 01:46:10,010
What about the cheese?

2856
01:46:11,130 --> 01:46:11,450
Sir?

2857
01:46:12,750 --> 01:46:14,430
What about the cheese?

2858
01:46:15,450 --> 01:46:16,090
This?

2859
01:46:16,230 --> 01:46:18,450
The cheese market is going up!

2860
01:46:18,550 --> 01:46:20,590
There is a cheese shortage right now in France!

2861
01:46:20,990 --> 01:46:23,970
They're going on their 500th strike!

2862
01:46:24,310 --> 01:46:25,150
It's their anniversary!

2863
01:46:25,810 --> 01:46:26,790
We're striking!

2864
01:46:27,770 --> 01:46:28,410
Okay.

2865
01:46:28,730 --> 01:46:29,370
Nice.

2866
01:46:29,430 --> 01:46:29,930
Powdered sugar.

2867
01:46:30,650 --> 01:46:31,150
Okay.

2868
01:46:31,150 --> 01:46:31,690
41.

2869
01:46:32,110 --> 01:46:32,430
50.

2870
01:46:34,090 --> 01:46:34,730
8.

2871
01:46:35,210 --> 01:46:35,850
50.

2872
01:46:35,990 --> 01:46:36,410
2.

2873
01:46:36,610 --> 01:46:37,010
Area.

2874
01:46:38,190 --> 01:46:38,830
Wait.

2875
01:46:38,890 --> 01:46:39,670
Is it profit?

2876
01:46:41,430 --> 01:46:42,070
Guys!

2877
01:46:42,410 --> 01:46:43,050
Cheese!

2878
01:46:45,870 --> 01:46:47,150
Oh my god.

2879
01:46:47,230 --> 01:46:48,670
Why does no one want the cheese?

2880
01:46:48,850 --> 01:46:50,210
Is the music not...

2881
01:46:50,210 --> 01:46:50,950
It's the music.

2882
01:46:51,050 --> 01:46:53,290
The music is not inciting cheese purchases.

2883
01:46:53,670 --> 01:46:54,770
Guys, we need...

2884
01:46:54,770 --> 01:46:55,130
We need...

2885
01:46:57,610 --> 01:47:01,610
The music is not giving me cheese vibes!

2886
01:47:02,190 --> 01:47:03,910
We need better music!

2887
01:47:04,490 --> 01:47:06,410
We need more cheese music!

2888
01:47:08,730 --> 01:47:09,870
What do I do?

2889
01:47:09,950 --> 01:47:11,570
Cheese copyright free.

2890
01:47:12,090 --> 01:47:12,850
Right?

2891
01:47:14,810 --> 01:47:15,570
Free...

2892
01:47:16,510 --> 01:47:17,270
Music.

2893
01:47:17,470 --> 01:47:18,030
Okay.

2894
01:47:18,090 --> 01:47:20,690
Cheese copyright free music.

2895
01:47:20,830 --> 01:47:21,410
What do I get?

2896
01:47:21,850 --> 01:47:23,430
Does it sound like cheese?

2897
01:47:25,550 --> 01:47:26,610
I can't tell.

2898
01:47:28,150 --> 01:47:30,090
This is 2 minutes long so I don't know.

2899
01:47:36,650 --> 01:47:37,130
Supermarket.

2900
01:47:37,450 --> 01:47:39,170
Royalty free stock supermarket.

2901
01:47:39,490 --> 01:47:40,530
Why is it so...

2902
01:47:40,530 --> 01:47:41,490
Oh hey.

2903
01:47:42,030 --> 01:47:43,130
Supermarket stock videos.

2904
01:47:43,570 --> 01:47:44,990
Is there music on that?

2905
01:47:45,070 --> 01:47:45,830
There is!

2906
01:47:48,070 --> 01:47:50,410
There's supermarket stock videos!

2907
01:47:50,990 --> 01:47:51,830
More songs.

2908
01:47:51,970 --> 01:47:52,590
More songs.

2909
01:47:52,810 --> 01:47:53,030
Okay.

2910
01:47:53,430 --> 01:47:54,370
It's not copyright free.

2911
01:47:54,470 --> 01:47:54,970
Reupload.

2912
01:47:54,990 --> 01:47:56,090
Sounds for the supermarket.

2913
01:47:56,410 --> 01:47:57,110
Oh my god!

2914
01:47:57,130 --> 01:47:58,250
Sounds for the supermarket!

2915
01:48:00,050 --> 01:48:00,730
Okay.

2916
01:48:00,990 --> 01:48:03,930
If you're looking for a classic then look no further.

2917
01:48:04,270 --> 01:48:10,890
This music contains inaudible subliminal recordings that were intended to increase buyer purchases!

2918
01:48:11,510 --> 01:48:12,190
Oh!

2919
01:48:12,270 --> 01:48:15,570
Oh my god!

2920
01:48:15,710 --> 01:48:17,470
The description is perfect!

2921
01:48:18,510 --> 01:48:19,190
Guys!

2922
01:48:21,190 --> 01:48:21,870
Guys!

2923
01:48:22,010 --> 01:48:25,390
It says here that it...

2924
01:48:25,390 --> 01:48:25,550
It says here that it...

2925
01:48:25,550 --> 01:48:34,210
This music contains inaudible subliminal recordings that were intended to increase buyer purchasing at grocery stores.

2926
01:48:34,470 --> 01:48:43,930
Customers were influenced to purchase more products as a result of the brain wave patterns hidden in the musical notes and the sound composition.

2927
01:48:44,050 --> 01:48:44,930
This is it.

2928
01:48:45,390 --> 01:48:47,630
This will get me all the cheese purchases.

2929
01:48:52,290 --> 01:48:54,250
I found it!

2930
01:48:54,870 --> 01:48:55,970
I found it!

2931
01:48:55,970 --> 01:48:56,730
Here you go!

2932
01:48:57,390 --> 01:48:59,070
Will you buy my cheese now?

2933
01:49:04,350 --> 01:49:05,770
We're so imersive!

2934
01:49:08,650 --> 01:49:09,170
Guys!

2935
01:49:09,390 --> 01:49:10,310
Oh my god!

2936
01:49:10,350 --> 01:49:11,810
It makes you wanna buy the cheese!

2937
01:49:16,370 --> 01:49:17,410
Super chat!

2938
01:49:17,510 --> 01:49:18,330
Super chat!

2939
01:49:18,410 --> 01:49:18,730
Now!

2940
01:49:26,770 --> 01:49:28,290
Okay, 2851.

2941
01:49:28,950 --> 01:49:29,370
Alright,

2942
01:49:32,910 --> 01:49:34,710
36.98.

2943
01:49:35,230 --> 01:49:37,510
Oh my god, look at all these customers!

2944
01:49:38,650 --> 01:49:39,770
It's working!

2945
01:49:40,270 --> 01:49:41,870
It just works!

2946
01:49:45,070 --> 01:49:48,050
Why suddenly I feel the urge to buy cheese.

2947
01:49:48,390 --> 01:49:50,250
Mr. Toon, thank you for the super chat.

2948
01:49:50,390 --> 01:49:51,450
Thank you, thank you.

2949
01:49:52,810 --> 01:49:54,470
Guys, it should work!

2950
01:49:56,850 --> 01:49:58,110
It should work!

2951
01:49:58,190 --> 01:49:59,370
There's two more hours!

2952
01:50:01,790 --> 01:50:04,990
The music, it's compelling me!

2953
01:50:05,310 --> 01:50:07,070
Thank you for the super chat, Ivan.

2954
01:50:07,170 --> 01:50:08,130
Thank you, thank you.

2955
01:50:08,150 --> 01:50:08,990
You can't resist.

2956
01:50:10,390 --> 01:50:11,710
You can't resist!

2957
01:50:11,870 --> 01:50:12,510
The music!

2958
01:50:13,290 --> 01:50:14,290
Come on, come on.

2959
01:50:14,370 --> 01:50:15,510
Sir, sir, you know you want.

2960
01:50:15,670 --> 01:50:17,870
Sir, sir, sir, the cheese is right there.

2961
01:50:17,930 --> 01:50:18,430
No, sir!

2962
01:50:18,970 --> 01:50:20,390
Sir, we have an hour left!

2963
01:50:20,650 --> 01:50:21,550
There's still hope!

2964
01:50:22,050 --> 01:50:22,810
Someone please!

2965
01:50:28,190 --> 01:50:32,130
For some reason I'm compelled to send this super chat.

2966
01:50:32,470 --> 01:50:34,390
It's just thank you for the super chat.

2967
01:50:34,490 --> 01:50:35,510
Thank you, thank you.

2968
01:50:35,610 --> 01:50:36,570
It just works!

2969
01:50:37,050 --> 01:50:38,470
It just works, guys!

2970
01:50:40,170 --> 01:50:40,650
Guys!

2971
01:50:40,650 --> 01:50:41,630
Cheese, please!

2972
01:50:41,870 --> 01:50:42,650
Please, we have five seconds.

2973
01:50:42,670 --> 01:50:43,210
Please, come in.

2974
01:50:43,310 --> 01:50:44,230
Come in for the cheese.

2975
01:50:44,490 --> 01:50:45,590
Please, come in.

2976
01:50:47,150 --> 01:50:48,510
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

2977
01:50:48,630 --> 01:50:49,770
No, that's not the cheese!

2978
01:50:49,930 --> 01:50:50,870
Come on, head to the cheese.

2979
01:50:51,230 --> 01:50:52,030
Head to the cheese.

2980
01:50:52,310 --> 01:50:52,710
Yes!

2981
01:50:52,990 --> 01:50:53,390
Yes!

2982
01:50:53,770 --> 01:50:54,850
Ba-da-dum!

2983
01:50:55,070 --> 01:50:56,310
Ba-ba-ba- No!

2984
01:51:01,210 --> 01:51:02,870
Thank you for the super chat.

2985
01:51:02,970 --> 01:51:03,910
Thank you, thank you.

2986
01:51:04,990 --> 01:51:07,270
It works on everything but the cheese!

2987
01:51:07,810 --> 01:51:08,210
No!

2988
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:16,840
But it says...

2989
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:19,980
Ba-dum, ba-bum...

2990
01:51:19,980 --> 01:51:22,780
Ba-da-dum...

2991
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:25,700
Okay, this is a good song.

2992
01:51:25,900 --> 01:51:26,980
They're not gonna lie.

2993
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:30,560
Now I know why people buy more.

2994
01:51:31,260 --> 01:51:32,900
Ba-da-dum...

2995
01:51:32,900 --> 01:51:34,120
Wait, is that cheese?

2996
01:51:34,660 --> 01:51:35,840
Oh, it worked!

2997
01:51:43,570 --> 01:51:45,090
We did it!

2998
01:51:45,830 --> 01:51:47,730
It just works!

2999
01:51:48,490 --> 01:51:50,850
It just works, guys!

3000
01:51:54,510 --> 01:51:55,550
Oh my...

3001
01:51:55,550 --> 01:51:57,650
Here, take that one cent for free!

3002
01:51:58,230 --> 01:51:59,470
Oh my god!

3003
01:51:59,510 --> 01:52:00,710
You deserve it, sir!

3004
01:52:01,230 --> 01:52:02,710
That one cent!

3005
01:52:03,750 --> 01:52:05,670
Our first $1000!

3006
01:52:07,030 --> 01:52:08,790
Mika, thank you for the Akasupa!

3007
01:52:09,090 --> 01:52:09,290
Mika, thank you for the Akasupa!

3008
01:52:09,290 --> 01:52:09,930
Thank you, thank you!

3009
01:52:10,010 --> 01:52:11,170
I don't know what happened.

3010
01:52:11,390 --> 01:52:12,430
But it happened.

3011
01:52:13,270 --> 01:52:14,610
Ba-da-dum!

3012
01:52:15,870 --> 01:52:16,350
Weird.

3013
01:52:16,430 --> 01:52:18,450
How did I get here, MrFroken?

3014
01:52:18,710 --> 01:52:19,770
Thank you for the superchat.

3015
01:52:19,870 --> 01:52:20,690
Thank you, thank you.

3016
01:52:20,770 --> 01:52:21,630
It just works.

3017
01:52:21,850 --> 01:52:22,990
And look at that!

3018
01:52:23,530 --> 01:52:24,450
My water!

3019
01:52:24,690 --> 01:52:25,430
It's gone!

3020
01:52:27,290 --> 01:52:28,250
Alright, and...

3021
01:52:29,550 --> 01:52:32,270
Wait, did all the cheese stuff fell down, too?

3022
01:52:32,370 --> 01:52:32,930
No, wait.

3023
01:52:32,990 --> 01:52:33,630
No, it's the same.

3024
01:52:34,070 --> 01:52:35,090
Ba-da-dum...

3025
01:52:35,090 --> 01:52:36,530
Ba-da-dum...

3026
01:52:37,090 --> 01:52:40,110
Suddenly I think I want to buy cereal.

3027
01:52:40,390 --> 01:52:41,790
Thank you for the superchat.

3028
01:52:41,830 --> 01:52:42,690
Thank you, thank you!

3029
01:52:42,690 --> 01:52:42,790
Thank you!

3030
01:52:42,790 --> 01:52:44,270
Jen, thank you for the super sticker!

3031
01:52:44,410 --> 01:52:44,910
Thank you!

3032
01:52:45,250 --> 01:52:46,150
Wait, what's over here?

3033
01:52:46,570 --> 01:52:47,470
Oh, my bread!

3034
01:52:47,670 --> 01:52:48,570
Okay, we need bread.

3035
01:52:50,590 --> 01:52:51,630
Guys, we did it!

3036
01:52:51,670 --> 01:52:52,750
We made our first thousand!

3037
01:52:53,130 --> 01:52:53,990
We made it!

3038
01:52:54,650 --> 01:52:55,510
We were here!

3039
01:52:56,410 --> 01:53:00,150
Oh my god, look at all these items were almost sold out.

3040
01:53:00,630 --> 01:53:01,550
Look at that!

3041
01:53:02,690 --> 01:53:04,670
It works, the subliminal messaging!

3042
01:53:07,530 --> 01:53:08,490
I knew...

3043
01:53:09,530 --> 01:53:11,650
I knew there was science to it!

3044
01:53:22,310 --> 01:53:23,690
I'm the best employee!

3045
01:53:25,330 --> 01:53:27,850
Burrito, thank you for the magenta soup!

3046
01:53:27,910 --> 01:53:28,530
Thank you!

3047
01:53:29,030 --> 01:53:33,110
I thought Doki was a gamer, but she's all about the cheese.

3048
01:53:33,230 --> 01:53:35,610
I have always been all about the cheese!

3049
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:38,170
I've been cheesing every video game I touch.

3050
01:53:40,670 --> 01:53:41,550
Look at that!

3051
01:53:41,550 --> 01:53:45,830
I think that subliminal music has worked better for the water than the cheese.

3052
01:53:45,910 --> 01:53:46,570
Not gonna lie.

3053
01:53:47,450 --> 01:53:49,150
Please, we're three levels away!

3054
01:53:49,470 --> 01:53:51,190
We're three levels away!

3055
01:53:51,370 --> 01:53:53,310
Please, buy my stuff!

3056
01:53:54,690 --> 01:53:56,010
Buy my merch!

3057
01:53:58,230 --> 01:53:58,910
Please!

3058
01:54:02,690 --> 01:54:03,850
Buy my merch!

3059
01:54:04,450 --> 01:54:05,610
Alright, we need...

3060
01:54:07,130 --> 01:54:09,390
We need to pay our bills though.

3061
01:54:10,410 --> 01:54:10,750
Bill...

3062
01:54:11,090 --> 01:54:11,530
Bill...

3063
01:54:11,550 --> 01:54:11,750
Bill.

3064
01:54:12,190 --> 01:54:12,690
Alright.

3065
01:54:13,350 --> 01:54:15,290
I think I can afford...

3066
01:54:15,290 --> 01:54:16,110
You know what?

3067
01:54:16,370 --> 01:54:17,970
I think I can afford another fridge.

3068
01:54:18,450 --> 01:54:18,830
You know what?

3069
01:54:18,830 --> 01:54:19,010
No!

3070
01:54:19,050 --> 01:54:20,630
I think I can afford...

3071
01:54:21,390 --> 01:54:23,230
I think I can afford another license.

3072
01:54:23,450 --> 01:54:24,210
What do I need?

3073
01:54:24,690 --> 01:54:25,370
Level 6.

3074
01:54:25,650 --> 01:54:31,210
Peanut butter, flour, olive oil, pasta, rice, and salt!

3075
01:54:31,450 --> 01:54:32,590
I have the money.

3076
01:54:32,850 --> 01:54:33,650
It's time.

3077
01:54:34,410 --> 01:54:35,170
It's time.

3078
01:54:36,050 --> 01:54:36,550
Alright.

3079
01:54:42,010 --> 01:54:43,950
Ba dum ba da dum!

3080
01:54:44,670 --> 01:54:45,230
Guys!

3081
01:54:45,890 --> 01:54:46,770
One water?

3082
01:54:46,950 --> 01:54:48,110
Good choice, good choice.

3083
01:54:48,550 --> 01:54:50,090
$3 water with your card.

3084
01:54:50,170 --> 01:54:51,390
That's good, that's good, that's good.

3085
01:54:51,990 --> 01:54:52,550
Alright.

3086
01:54:53,810 --> 01:54:54,370
35...

3087
01:54:55,530 --> 01:54:56,470
1 cent.

3088
01:54:57,170 --> 01:54:57,730
Alright.

3089
01:54:57,810 --> 01:54:58,970
We gotta stock it up.

3090
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:01,850
Please, we're so close to...

3091
01:55:02,470 --> 01:55:03,290
Peanut butter.

3092
01:55:03,610 --> 01:55:05,110
Okay, we put peanut butter here.

3093
01:55:06,150 --> 01:55:09,090
And then, we gotta make sure nobody buys peanut butter...

3094
01:55:09,550 --> 01:55:09,830
Now.

3095
01:55:10,130 --> 01:55:11,330
Okay, $7.

3096
01:55:12,070 --> 01:55:12,630
There you go.

3097
01:55:13,770 --> 01:55:14,470
Want milk?

3098
01:55:14,790 --> 01:55:15,770
No problem, sir.

3099
01:55:16,150 --> 01:55:18,190
Oh, thank you for the exact change!

3100
01:55:19,050 --> 01:55:19,990
Alright, salt.

3101
01:55:20,850 --> 01:55:22,390
Put the salt right here.

3102
01:55:23,390 --> 01:55:25,910
Oh my god, we're expanding so hard right now.

3103
01:55:26,210 --> 01:55:27,010
Look at that.

3104
01:55:27,090 --> 01:55:28,590
And also some rice!

3105
01:55:29,190 --> 01:55:30,330
Some rice with your spaghetti!

3106
01:55:32,710 --> 01:55:33,390
That's right!

3107
01:55:34,090 --> 01:55:35,290
So guys, give me a sec.

3108
01:55:36,010 --> 01:55:37,710
Please don't buy my stuff yet!

3109
01:55:38,390 --> 01:55:38,950
$4.

3110
01:55:40,230 --> 01:55:40,790
Uhhh...

3111
01:55:42,010 --> 01:55:42,610
$9.

3112
01:55:42,710 --> 01:55:43,590
There you go.

3113
01:55:43,790 --> 01:55:45,290
Guys, this is very expensive rice.

3114
01:55:45,330 --> 01:55:45,690
It's imported.

3115
01:55:45,970 --> 01:55:47,090
All my stuff here is imported.

3116
01:55:47,650 --> 01:55:48,250
Uhh...

3117
01:55:50,070 --> 01:55:51,270
From America.

3118
01:55:54,550 --> 01:55:57,030
I never said where it's imported!

3119
01:55:57,650 --> 01:55:59,530
Did I say Madagascar?

3120
01:55:59,630 --> 01:56:00,570
Peanut oil?

3121
01:56:01,110 --> 01:56:03,070
I meant Madagascar City.

3122
01:56:08,670 --> 01:56:11,450
I meant Madagascar City, guys.

3123
01:56:11,490 --> 01:56:11,530
I meant Madagascar City, guys.

3124
01:56:13,630 --> 01:56:16,410
And did I say like Little... Did I say Italy?

3125
01:56:17,290 --> 01:56:19,550
I meant Little Italy in New York City.

3126
01:56:23,630 --> 01:56:25,030
It is imported!

3127
01:56:25,390 --> 01:56:27,650
Just not where you think it's imported.

3128
01:56:28,850 --> 01:56:29,530
Guys!

3129
01:56:29,790 --> 01:56:33,110
You don't want to support the grandmas in Little Italy?

3130
01:56:33,910 --> 01:56:35,250
I agree.

3131
01:56:37,230 --> 01:56:38,590
I agree.

3132
01:56:38,590 --> 01:56:39,850
Yeah, I meant the Madagascar.

3133
01:56:40,810 --> 01:56:42,610
Madagascar movie themed oil.

3134
01:56:42,890 --> 01:56:44,230
You know like how like...

3135
01:56:45,130 --> 01:56:48,510
Like companies like to sell vegetables to kids.

3136
01:56:48,690 --> 01:56:51,210
They just put like cartoon characters on there.

3137
01:56:51,390 --> 01:56:52,230
To like...

3138
01:56:52,850 --> 01:56:54,450
To like try to convince...

3139
01:56:54,450 --> 01:56:56,710
Like there's nothing different between the vegetables.

3140
01:56:57,050 --> 01:56:58,870
It's literally just like...

3141
01:56:58,870 --> 01:57:00,750
Like they just slap Shrek there to be...

3142
01:57:00,750 --> 01:57:01,750
Make you eat more veggies.

3143
01:57:03,010 --> 01:57:04,310
Because they're like, oh my god!

3144
01:57:04,350 --> 01:57:04,510
Look!

3145
01:57:04,610 --> 01:57:05,230
This carrot!

3146
01:57:05,370 --> 01:57:07,630
These carrots have Shrek's face on it!

3147
01:57:07,690 --> 01:57:08,830
Eat your veggie, kids!

3148
01:57:08,830 --> 01:57:10,070
So it's basically like that.

3149
01:57:10,130 --> 01:57:12,070
I slapped the Madagascar movie.

3150
01:57:13,570 --> 01:57:14,950
It's just marketing.

3151
01:57:18,050 --> 01:57:18,570
Nice.

3152
01:57:18,570 --> 01:57:19,110
There you go.

3153
01:57:19,530 --> 01:57:20,050
Okay.

3154
01:57:20,110 --> 01:57:20,770
I think it's time.

3155
01:57:20,910 --> 01:57:21,850
I think it's time to change...

3156
01:57:21,850 --> 01:57:22,690
Swap up the music.

3157
01:57:23,130 --> 01:57:24,530
Even I'm going crazy.

3158
01:57:28,490 --> 01:57:29,390
I think...

3159
01:57:29,390 --> 01:57:31,890
I'm lowkey going crazy with this song.

3160
01:57:31,990 --> 01:57:32,770
So I...

3161
01:57:33,570 --> 01:57:36,350
For the sake of everybody's sanity.

3162
01:57:36,870 --> 01:57:38,690
I'm going to swap.

3163
01:57:38,830 --> 01:57:39,470
The music.

3164
01:57:43,290 --> 01:57:43,950
Okay.

3165
01:57:45,830 --> 01:57:48,570
I was about to spend money too.

3166
01:57:48,710 --> 01:57:50,770
I was almost about to spend money.

3167
01:57:54,710 --> 01:57:58,210
The background music is melting my brain.

3168
01:57:58,450 --> 01:57:59,130
Do not worry.

3169
01:57:59,470 --> 01:58:01,570
Do not worry.

3170
01:58:02,170 --> 01:58:02,810
Why...

3171
01:58:02,810 --> 01:58:04,110
I saved this all.

3172
01:58:04,350 --> 01:58:05,010
I was like...

3173
01:58:05,010 --> 01:58:05,470
Oh no.

3174
01:58:05,590 --> 01:58:08,050
I'm about to do retail therapy.

3175
01:58:11,850 --> 01:58:16,550
I had to stop myself as well for all of us.

3176
01:58:16,610 --> 01:58:19,270
For all of us, it was for the greater good.

3177
01:58:19,370 --> 01:58:21,950
Let me find better music real fast.

3178
01:58:24,830 --> 01:58:26,450
Honestly, I didn't really hear...

3179
01:58:26,450 --> 01:58:28,990
I genuinely work in a grocery store.

3180
01:58:29,290 --> 01:58:33,270
I feel... yeah, I think workers who had to work...

3181
01:58:33,270 --> 01:58:36,890
Like the supermarket workers that had to listen to the...

3182
01:58:36,890 --> 01:58:39,070
I'm pretty sure they don't change up the songs, right?

3183
01:58:39,190 --> 01:58:42,830
At the supermarket or at any targets or whatever.

3184
01:58:43,010 --> 01:58:44,330
They don't really change up the song.

3185
01:58:44,590 --> 01:58:49,510
So every day you're just listening to the same song over and over and over again.

3186
01:58:49,590 --> 01:58:50,610
Every single day.

3187
01:58:50,730 --> 01:58:52,530
I would fucking go crazy.

3188
01:58:53,070 --> 01:58:54,350
Oh my god.

3189
01:58:54,610 --> 01:58:57,290
I think I would go crazy too.

3190
01:58:58,490 --> 01:58:59,050
Okay.

3191
01:58:59,270 --> 01:59:01,350
I mean, not that they don't.

3192
01:59:01,430 --> 01:59:04,070
Yeah, they do not.

3193
01:59:05,470 --> 01:59:06,770
I'm here for an excuse.

3194
01:59:06,890 --> 01:59:08,870
Creepism not bringing you back to hell.

3195
01:59:09,070 --> 01:59:09,570
Yeah.

3196
01:59:10,070 --> 01:59:10,730
Don't worry.

3197
01:59:11,110 --> 01:59:11,810
Don't worry.

3198
01:59:11,950 --> 01:59:15,430
I'm here to help you escape from the torture of Weiji Keiji.

3199
01:59:16,090 --> 01:59:17,110
Alright, let's see.

3200
01:59:18,550 --> 01:59:19,890
I need to find...

3201
01:59:19,890 --> 01:59:24,670
There was this channel that I really like for copyright-free music.

3202
01:59:24,790 --> 01:59:26,930
But I need to find it again.

3203
01:59:27,210 --> 01:59:30,130
I need to find it again, guys.

3204
01:59:30,230 --> 01:59:31,470
Just give me a sec.

3205
01:59:32,650 --> 01:59:33,650
God damn it.

3206
01:59:33,670 --> 01:59:34,290
Where is it?

3207
01:59:35,290 --> 01:59:36,690
It's one of my favorite... like...

3208
01:59:36,890 --> 01:59:43,010
background BGMs place because it was copyright-free and it was really nice.

3209
01:59:43,090 --> 01:59:45,130
It was like a Korean channel too.

3210
01:59:45,370 --> 01:59:47,850
I just need to find the channel again because it's been a while.

3211
01:59:48,150 --> 01:59:49,250
Where is it?

3212
01:59:49,270 --> 01:59:49,530
No!

3213
01:59:50,990 --> 01:59:52,250
Where is it?

3214
01:59:52,450 --> 01:59:54,130
We can't go crazy!

3215
01:59:56,050 --> 01:59:57,570
No, it's not Doba Syndrome.

3216
01:59:57,910 --> 01:59:59,950
It's like a Korean...

3217
02:00:02,270 --> 02:00:04,270
It's a Korean one and it's really nice.

3218
02:00:04,450 --> 02:00:06,030
Oh wait, did they change the...

3219
02:00:06,490 --> 02:00:07,570
Wait, is it this one?

3220
02:00:07,970 --> 02:00:09,130
Where is the free music?

3221
02:00:09,210 --> 02:00:09,970
No, it's not this one.

3222
02:00:10,550 --> 02:00:11,650
What was it?

3223
02:00:11,850 --> 02:00:13,290
I'm trying to remember the...

3224
02:00:14,190 --> 02:00:14,630
The...

3225
02:00:14,630 --> 02:00:17,250
Yeah, there was like this really good...

3226
02:00:18,130 --> 02:00:21,570
Really good Korean channel for copyright BGM music.

3227
02:00:23,510 --> 02:00:23,950
Uhhhh...

3228
02:00:25,270 --> 02:00:26,810
I'm trying to like remember...

3229
02:00:27,970 --> 02:00:29,150
What it was called.

3230
02:00:32,770 --> 02:00:34,030
Oh, is it this one?

3231
02:00:34,270 --> 02:00:35,150
I'm gonna try this one.

3232
02:00:37,490 --> 02:00:38,050
Uhhhh...

3233
02:00:38,050 --> 02:00:38,850
Is it this channel?

3234
02:00:39,230 --> 02:00:40,510
No, it wasn't this channel.

3235
02:00:40,750 --> 02:00:41,710
It was not this one.

3236
02:00:41,750 --> 02:00:43,550
It was like a blue...

3237
02:00:43,550 --> 02:00:45,110
It was a blue...

3238
02:00:46,610 --> 02:00:47,170
Icon.

3239
02:00:49,770 --> 02:00:51,350
It was a blue icon.

3240
02:00:51,710 --> 02:00:52,650
Not this one.

3241
02:00:59,640 --> 02:01:02,160
It was so cute too!

3242
02:01:02,700 --> 02:01:06,200
They had such cute music.

3243
02:01:06,200 --> 02:01:07,540
Oh, I found it!

3244
02:01:07,640 --> 02:01:08,200
I found it.

3245
02:01:08,580 --> 02:01:09,680
I found it, guys.

3246
02:01:10,060 --> 02:01:11,540
It's one of my favorite BGM...

3247
02:01:11,540 --> 02:01:11,980
It's called...

3248
02:01:11,980 --> 02:01:12,920
This is the one I use.

3249
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:17,560
This is the BGM place I use usually.

3250
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:19,480
Their stuff is like super cute.

3251
02:01:20,080 --> 02:01:21,100
And they have a lot.

3252
02:01:22,140 --> 02:01:23,320
I love using this.

3253
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:27,480
There you go.

3254
02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:29,320
Now we can be less insane.

3255
02:01:29,860 --> 02:01:30,780
Alright, here you go.

3256
02:01:31,060 --> 02:01:31,180
Hahaha!

3257
02:01:32,900 --> 02:01:33,680
Ba dum.

3258
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:35,720
Ba dum ba dum ba dum.

3259
02:01:36,200 --> 02:01:36,680
Ba dum.

3260
02:01:36,940 --> 02:01:37,680
Ba dum.

3261
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:41,720
Now I can be stuck in a cage for a little bit longer.

3262
02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:49,380
Sanity restoring.

3263
02:01:49,500 --> 02:01:52,380
I can work in a cage a little longer.

3264
02:01:56,360 --> 02:01:57,520
Is that great?

3265
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:01,440
Alright, thank you for the super chat.

3266
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:01,780
Thank you.

3267
02:02:01,800 --> 02:02:02,260
Thank you.

3268
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:05,480
You still work in electronic style and the song playlist was bad.

3269
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:08,360
But during Christmas, it was literally torture.

3270
02:02:08,780 --> 02:02:10,820
Oh yeah, all the Mariah Carey's.

3271
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,920
The thing is, there's not a lot of Christmas music too.

3272
02:02:14,360 --> 02:02:19,720
Especially for one that you have to do it for hours and hours straight.

3273
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:24,540
There's not enough music to keep up for Christmas season.

3274
02:02:25,140 --> 02:02:26,020
There's like what?

3275
02:02:26,080 --> 02:02:27,640
Two hours max of songs.

3276
02:02:29,200 --> 02:02:33,740
All I want for Christmas is you.

3277
02:02:35,480 --> 02:02:35,580
Hahaha!

3278
02:02:35,900 --> 02:02:35,940
Hahaha!

3279
02:02:37,980 --> 02:02:39,080
Alright, let's see.

3280
02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:41,400
Uh, wait.

3281
02:02:41,940 --> 02:02:42,840
Oh, I'm giving.

3282
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:43,260
Wait.

3283
02:02:43,380 --> 02:02:43,980
Whoops, sorry.

3284
02:02:44,100 --> 02:02:44,860
This is not that.

3285
02:02:45,020 --> 02:02:48,180
I don't know why I tried to give you like $16 there.

3286
02:02:49,560 --> 02:02:50,620
Give me a sec.

3287
02:02:50,680 --> 02:02:51,580
Please be patient.

3288
02:02:51,660 --> 02:02:52,220
I'm stupid.

3289
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:54,720
Uh, there you go.

3290
02:02:54,740 --> 02:02:57,480
That was the longest 47 cents ever.

3291
02:02:58,140 --> 02:02:58,600
Coffee!

3292
02:02:59,820 --> 02:03:00,740
Extra coffee?

3293
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:01,860
No, I have extra tea.

3294
02:03:02,380 --> 02:03:02,840
Alright.

3295
02:03:03,560 --> 02:03:04,980
At least I'm almost...

3296
02:03:04,980 --> 02:03:05,460
I'm almost done.

3297
02:03:05,460 --> 02:03:06,060
Level 8.

3298
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:07,880
Please.

3299
02:03:10,740 --> 02:03:12,540
Please buy from my store.

3300
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:15,340
I need more shoppers.

3301
02:03:16,200 --> 02:03:17,040
Sir, no!

3302
02:03:17,860 --> 02:03:18,460
Please!

3303
02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:20,080
I need to be level 10!

3304
02:03:21,400 --> 02:03:22,000
Hahaha!

3305
02:03:24,680 --> 02:03:25,280
Please!

3306
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:31,500
Don't you want me to hire a teenager and pay the minimum wage, sir?

3307
02:03:32,260 --> 02:03:34,960
And give them real life working experience?

3308
02:03:34,960 --> 02:03:35,740
Sir!

3309
02:03:38,500 --> 02:03:41,120
Think of the minimum wage teenager!

3310
02:03:42,580 --> 02:03:43,380
Alright.

3311
02:03:43,500 --> 02:03:44,240
Cereal.

3312
02:03:44,480 --> 02:03:45,240
Nope.

3313
02:03:45,480 --> 02:03:46,240
Hahaha!

3314
02:03:47,480 --> 02:03:51,180
They need this job to buy their graphics card!

3315
02:03:53,200 --> 02:03:54,000
Alright.

3316
02:03:54,120 --> 02:03:54,740
Nice.

3317
02:03:54,880 --> 02:03:55,380
Let's see.

3318
02:03:55,720 --> 02:03:58,800
30 at 2.51.

3319
02:03:59,260 --> 02:03:59,500
Whoops.

3320
02:03:59,820 --> 02:04:00,620
Nice.

3321
02:04:01,060 --> 02:04:01,860
Cereal!

3322
02:04:02,580 --> 02:04:02,820
Hahaha!

3323
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:04,080
Hahaha!

3324
02:04:04,140 --> 02:04:04,940
Cereal!

3325
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:17,680
Please let me employ this minimum wage teenager for their first work experience!

3326
02:04:18,280 --> 02:04:19,940
Think of the teenager!

3327
02:04:21,820 --> 02:04:22,220
Okay.

3328
02:04:22,540 --> 02:04:23,320
Two...

3329
02:04:25,020 --> 02:04:25,800
Forty...

3330
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:27,220
One cents.

3331
02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:28,000
There you go.

3332
02:04:29,300 --> 02:04:30,080
Alright.

3333
02:04:30,200 --> 02:04:31,040
Where's your money?

3334
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:32,220
Four dollars.

3335
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:33,740
Bam.

3336
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:34,400
Okay.

3337
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:34,480
I'm gonna go buy some coffee.

3338
02:04:34,540 --> 02:04:35,920
Oh no.

3339
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,380
No one wants to work here.

3340
02:04:38,600 --> 02:04:39,420
Where are the lights?

3341
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:40,540
You don't need lights!

3342
02:04:41,140 --> 02:04:42,440
Use your eyes!

3343
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:44,100
You have eyes!

3344
02:04:44,240 --> 02:04:46,180
We have built-in night vision!

3345
02:04:46,860 --> 02:04:47,500
Wait.

3346
02:04:47,580 --> 02:04:49,600
I've messed up my fucking playlist already.

3347
02:04:49,820 --> 02:04:50,200
Hahaha!

3348
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:56,980
You don't need it!

3349
02:04:59,180 --> 02:05:01,340
We have built-in night vision!

3350
02:05:03,480 --> 02:05:04,340
Do it!

3351
02:05:04,340 --> 02:05:04,520
Yes!

3352
02:05:04,540 --> 02:05:05,140
We do!

3353
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:09,160
The longer we work in the dark, the better evolved we are.

3354
02:05:09,660 --> 02:05:10,180
Alright.

3355
02:05:10,780 --> 02:05:16,960
Thank you, ma'am, for thinking about the teenagers and letting me hire one for minimum wage.

3356
02:05:18,360 --> 02:05:18,880
Hahaha!

3357
02:05:20,060 --> 02:05:20,860
Oh yeah!

3358
02:05:20,920 --> 02:05:23,280
It's better to hide prices in darkness too!

3359
02:05:23,720 --> 02:05:24,940
That's the best part!

3360
02:05:29,290 --> 02:05:30,470
That's the best part!

3361
02:05:31,290 --> 02:05:34,230
If they can't see the price, they don't know it's overpriced.

3362
02:05:34,870 --> 02:05:35,390
Hahaha!

3363
02:05:35,690 --> 02:05:36,210
Hahaha!

3364
02:05:36,210 --> 02:05:40,470
We are a store that cares about our customers' vision.

3365
02:05:40,670 --> 02:05:47,610
If you guys don't know, some people are living with sensitive eyes.

3366
02:05:48,090 --> 02:05:50,210
We are here for those people.

3367
02:05:50,690 --> 02:05:52,950
It's all about the au naturel.

3368
02:05:53,290 --> 02:05:53,930
Hahaha!

3369
02:05:55,630 --> 02:05:56,270
Hahaha!

3370
02:05:57,890 --> 02:05:58,530
Hahaha!

3371
02:05:58,710 --> 02:05:58,770
Hahaha!

3372
02:05:58,910 --> 02:05:59,370
Hahaha!

3373
02:05:59,370 --> 02:05:59,610
Hahaha!

3374
02:05:59,610 --> 02:05:59,650
Hahaha!

3375
02:05:59,650 --> 02:06:02,130
We are the au naturel store.

3376
02:06:03,730 --> 02:06:04,290
Nice.

3377
02:06:04,450 --> 02:06:04,690
Alright.

3378
02:06:05,190 --> 02:06:06,070
Oh no.

3379
02:06:06,150 --> 02:06:06,370
No!

3380
02:06:06,610 --> 02:06:07,570
The oil!

3381
02:06:08,610 --> 02:06:10,370
Not the oil cell!

3382
02:06:11,490 --> 02:06:12,050
Okay.

3383
02:06:12,110 --> 02:06:14,070
We will make it for the others' profit.

3384
02:06:17,970 --> 02:06:18,530
No!

3385
02:06:21,610 --> 02:06:22,170
Oh

3386
02:06:26,810 --> 02:06:27,350
wait!

3387
02:06:27,410 --> 02:06:28,030
That's not the oil.

3388
02:06:28,270 --> 02:06:30,230
That's not the oil I work with.

3389
02:06:30,470 --> 02:06:30,950
Oh no.

3390
02:06:31,010 --> 02:06:31,410
It is.

3391
02:06:31,630 --> 02:06:32,050
Hahaha!

3392
02:06:32,510 --> 02:06:33,130
It is.

3393
02:06:33,870 --> 02:06:34,430
Oh!

3394
02:06:35,370 --> 02:06:35,930
Oh!

3395
02:06:38,540 --> 02:06:38,580
Oh!

3396
02:06:38,580 --> 02:06:38,920
Oh!

3397
02:06:41,860 --> 02:06:44,020
My brain working for minimum wage.

3398
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:46,960
Hahahahaha!

3399
02:06:51,300 --> 02:06:52,600
I love it here.

3400
02:06:53,420 --> 02:06:53,820
Joki!

3401
02:06:54,120 --> 02:06:54,520
Please!

3402
02:06:57,460 --> 02:06:59,200
Please, thank you for the 아까 수파.

3403
02:06:59,300 --> 02:06:59,560
Thank you.

3404
02:06:59,620 --> 02:07:00,100
Thank you.

3405
02:07:00,200 --> 02:07:02,840
It's my birthday day so I want to give you something back.

3406
02:07:03,180 --> 02:07:05,240
Thank you for making us smile, Joki.

3407
02:07:05,260 --> 02:07:05,800
Thank you.

3408
02:07:05,800 --> 02:07:07,520
I'm glad you have been enjoying your time.

3409
02:07:07,600 --> 02:07:08,920
Happy birthday to you.

3410
02:07:10,640 --> 02:07:13,340
It's hard to sing with this song in the background.

3411
02:07:13,740 --> 02:07:16,720
Happy birthday dear, Rodrigo.

3412
02:07:16,720 --> 02:07:18,000
Happy birthday to you.

3413
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:23,580
Alright,

3414
02:07:29,940 --> 02:07:31,280
is there anything else we need?

3415
02:07:31,580 --> 02:07:33,980
I feel like we have... okay, rice.

3416
02:07:34,080 --> 02:07:34,900
Oh, olive oil.

3417
02:07:35,060 --> 02:07:36,120
Okay, we'll grab olive oil.

3418
02:07:36,120 --> 02:07:38,700
We'll grab another cup of flour.

3419
02:07:39,400 --> 02:07:40,740
And then, what else?

3420
02:07:40,880 --> 02:07:41,600
What else do we need?

3421
02:07:42,020 --> 02:07:43,320
Okay, do we have shells for it?

3422
02:07:43,380 --> 02:07:44,260
Okay, we have two, three.

3423
02:07:44,320 --> 02:07:45,240
We have two, three.

3424
02:07:45,340 --> 02:07:45,620
Okay.

3425
02:07:45,680 --> 02:07:46,740
And then pasta, spaghetti.

3426
02:07:47,600 --> 02:07:49,860
We're so close to level A.

3427
02:07:50,420 --> 02:07:52,120
We're so close to level A.

3428
02:07:52,360 --> 02:07:53,180
Okay, spaghetti.

3429
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:55,220
Spaghetti.

3430
02:07:55,220 --> 02:07:56,640
Somebody would need the spaghetti!

3431
02:07:57,920 --> 02:07:58,820
Give me a sec.

3432
02:07:59,660 --> 02:08:01,720
I need to put down supreme flour.

3433
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:04,200
Uhh, spaghetti.

3434
02:08:04,300 --> 02:08:05,440
Okay, market price.

3435
02:08:05,660 --> 02:08:06,100
Okay.

3436
02:08:06,120 --> 02:08:07,620
I'm gonna do 7.50.

3437
02:08:08,460 --> 02:08:09,540
And then...

3438
02:08:10,620 --> 02:08:13,380
No, no, do not buy the average cost!

3439
02:08:13,660 --> 02:08:14,360
I need profit!

3440
02:08:15,100 --> 02:08:16,180
7.7.

3441
02:08:16,440 --> 02:08:17,180
There we go.

3442
02:08:17,940 --> 02:08:18,800
Butter, butter.

3443
02:08:19,320 --> 02:08:21,580
Nice, thank you for... We have new flour!

3444
02:08:21,740 --> 02:08:22,680
Would you like new flour?

3445
02:08:24,760 --> 02:08:25,300
Alright.

3446
02:08:26,100 --> 02:08:28,220
37.05.

3447
02:08:29,380 --> 02:08:32,160
Do you really care about that five cents, sir?

3448
02:08:33,020 --> 02:08:34,040
God damn it.

3449
02:08:34,140 --> 02:08:35,240
You and your fucking...

3450
02:08:36,460 --> 02:08:38,560
$100 bill for one fucking flour.

3451
02:08:41,120 --> 02:08:41,560
Milk!

3452
02:08:41,820 --> 02:08:42,400
We need milk!

3453
02:08:43,880 --> 02:08:44,320
Milk.

3454
02:08:45,480 --> 02:08:45,920
Nice.

3455
02:08:46,100 --> 02:08:46,320
Okay.

3456
02:08:47,240 --> 02:08:47,680
Milk.

3457
02:08:47,780 --> 02:08:48,280
Oh shit!

3458
02:08:48,380 --> 02:08:49,060
Wait, I bought...

3459
02:08:49,060 --> 02:08:50,080
Oh, I forgot about the oil!

3460
02:08:50,360 --> 02:08:51,480
I forgot about the oil!

3461
02:08:51,580 --> 02:08:51,840
Please!

3462
02:08:51,980 --> 02:08:52,660
No, my milk!

3463
02:08:52,900 --> 02:08:54,640
Can my milk get run over by a car?

3464
02:08:56,620 --> 02:08:58,460
I'm asking for scientific purposes.

3465
02:08:59,620 --> 02:09:00,060
Alright.

3466
02:09:00,180 --> 02:09:00,620
Nice.

3467
02:09:00,760 --> 02:09:00,940
Alright.

3468
02:09:01,700 --> 02:09:02,640
Boop, boop, boop, boop.

3469
02:09:03,580 --> 02:09:04,020
Okay.

3470
02:09:04,960 --> 02:09:05,920
90 cents.

3471
02:09:08,140 --> 02:09:09,300
Guys, we're almost there.

3472
02:09:09,660 --> 02:09:10,960
We're almost at level eight.

3473
02:09:12,080 --> 02:09:12,820
Plus five.

3474
02:09:13,380 --> 02:09:15,180
Guys, we're gonna hit the big eight!

3475
02:09:15,820 --> 02:09:16,860
The big eight!

3476
02:09:19,220 --> 02:09:20,060
Two dollars.

3477
02:09:20,500 --> 02:09:22,380
Oh my god, I'm so fast at this now.

3478
02:09:22,560 --> 02:09:24,140
Can I upgrade my store now?

3479
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:25,680
Management Grove.

3480
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,060
Oh my god, section two!

3481
02:09:28,260 --> 02:09:30,180
We don't need to expand though, I feel like.

3482
02:09:30,260 --> 02:09:31,360
I think like we're cozy.

3483
02:09:32,100 --> 02:09:32,580
Honestly.

3484
02:09:32,660 --> 02:09:33,720
Like, we're cozy.

3485
02:09:33,720 --> 02:09:34,240
We're cozy here.

3486
02:09:35,420 --> 02:09:38,500
What does expanding do for us anyway?

3487
02:09:39,120 --> 02:09:42,140
Like, it's not like more people are gonna show up.

3488
02:09:42,340 --> 02:09:42,820
Like...

3489
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:45,960
If you think about it.

3490
02:09:46,260 --> 02:09:48,380
Like, I don't think more people are...

3491
02:09:48,380 --> 02:09:50,820
is just gonna show up to my store.

3492
02:09:51,100 --> 02:09:52,640
Oh shit, I'm running out of coffee now.

3493
02:09:53,080 --> 02:09:53,640
Okay.

3494
02:09:53,840 --> 02:09:54,640
Give me a sec.

3495
02:09:55,280 --> 02:09:55,840
Okay.

3496
02:09:55,900 --> 02:09:56,920
I need to buy coffee.

3497
02:09:57,860 --> 02:09:58,740
Where's coffee?

3498
02:10:00,060 --> 02:10:00,620
Uhhh...

3499
02:10:00,620 --> 02:10:01,620
Dark roast.

3500
02:10:01,700 --> 02:10:01,980
Okay.

3501
02:10:02,080 --> 02:10:02,500
There we go.

3502
02:10:03,980 --> 02:10:05,080
Stop, stop sir!

3503
02:10:05,560 --> 02:10:06,080
Stop!

3504
02:10:07,140 --> 02:10:07,900
Coffee's coming!

3505
02:10:09,480 --> 02:10:10,000
Ahhh!

3506
02:10:10,260 --> 02:10:11,100
There's too many boxes!

3507
02:10:14,420 --> 02:10:15,440
Alright, let's see.

3508
02:10:15,580 --> 02:10:18,340
Thirty one point fifty three.

3509
02:10:18,620 --> 02:10:19,640
Guys, don't worry.

3510
02:10:19,700 --> 02:10:22,020
When the teenager is here, I'll start throwing the boxes away.

3511
02:10:22,500 --> 02:10:24,240
I just don't have time right now.

3512
02:10:25,120 --> 02:10:26,800
We're just gonna stockpile some...

3513
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:28,120
It's called the environment.

3514
02:10:28,660 --> 02:10:30,440
We're gonna reuse, resell.

3515
02:10:30,960 --> 02:10:32,280
We're gonna sell the boxes.

3516
02:10:32,280 --> 02:10:35,780
People will wanna use the boxes to carry their stuff home, you know?

3517
02:10:38,020 --> 02:10:43,000
Don't you know, like at Costco, there's like a ton of boxes that you can just like pick up?

3518
02:10:43,420 --> 02:10:44,460
That's what it is!

3519
02:10:48,920 --> 02:10:50,440
You know what I'm talking about?

3520
02:10:54,760 --> 02:10:56,720
It's called saving the environment.

3521
02:10:56,880 --> 02:10:57,960
You guys wouldn't understand.

3522
02:10:58,160 --> 02:11:00,340
You guys don't love the environment as much as me.

3523
02:11:01,400 --> 02:11:02,100
Oh my god.

3524
02:11:02,100 --> 02:11:02,460
Look at that.

3525
02:11:02,840 --> 02:11:04,000
We're almost level nine.

3526
02:11:04,260 --> 02:11:05,000
Wait, do you want a card?

3527
02:11:05,480 --> 02:11:06,220
Okay, card.

3528
02:11:07,100 --> 02:11:07,540
Please.

3529
02:11:07,600 --> 02:11:08,980
All I wanna do is just hire...

3530
02:11:08,980 --> 02:11:09,380
Why is...

3531
02:11:09,380 --> 02:11:12,340
Why do you have to be level ten to hire the minimum wage worker?

3532
02:11:12,600 --> 02:11:13,100
I don't understand.

3533
02:11:13,600 --> 02:11:15,320
Like, I'm literally giving him free money.

3534
02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:19,700
I'm a good boss too.

3535
02:11:20,200 --> 02:11:21,280
I'm a good boss.

3536
02:11:22,040 --> 02:11:23,440
Let me hire him.

3537
02:11:28,200 --> 02:11:29,300
Oh, the olive oil!

3538
02:11:29,300 --> 02:11:30,560
Oh no!

3539
02:11:30,680 --> 02:11:32,040
Stop buying the olive oil!

3540
02:11:32,080 --> 02:11:33,000
I'm not making profit!

3541
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:37,960
Stop!

3542
02:11:38,580 --> 02:11:39,100
Stop!

3543
02:11:42,980 --> 02:11:44,800
I forgot the olive oil!

3544
02:11:52,730 --> 02:11:53,250
Okay.

3545
02:11:53,810 --> 02:11:55,210
Alright, the last level.

3546
02:11:55,970 --> 02:11:58,850
For the last level, we're gonna have a big sale.

3547
02:12:00,030 --> 02:12:01,690
But for now, we need to make money.

3548
02:12:04,030 --> 02:12:05,830
Stop buying yellow.

3549
02:12:06,210 --> 02:12:06,890
No!

3550
02:12:07,050 --> 02:12:08,410
I lost all the oil!

3551
02:12:10,170 --> 02:12:14,630
Too many people took advantage of the poor businesswoman!

3552
02:12:15,430 --> 02:12:16,490
Okay, oil.

3553
02:12:16,710 --> 02:12:18,470
I need to restock it apparently.

3554
02:12:18,990 --> 02:12:21,290
I lost weed.

3555
02:12:21,670 --> 02:12:23,710
Just go out of business.

3556
02:12:24,450 --> 02:12:29,290
Don't anybody think of the fucking poor businesswoman.

3557
02:12:29,290 --> 02:12:31,950
Oh my god, my water!

3558
02:12:32,010 --> 02:12:32,970
I need water too!

3559
02:12:33,550 --> 02:12:34,150
Okay.

3560
02:12:36,070 --> 02:12:37,930
Please just wait at the cashier.

3561
02:12:37,970 --> 02:12:38,730
I'm getting water.

3562
02:12:39,950 --> 02:12:42,170
It's called tax loss arms.

3563
02:12:43,790 --> 02:12:44,890
Give me a sec!

3564
02:12:45,350 --> 02:12:46,810
There's so many boxes!

3565
02:12:48,450 --> 02:12:49,450
Okay, 14.

3566
02:12:50,630 --> 02:12:51,230
Alright.

3567
02:12:52,870 --> 02:12:53,470
Cash.

3568
02:12:53,590 --> 02:12:54,190
One dollar.

3569
02:12:54,290 --> 02:12:54,530
Nice.

3570
02:12:54,590 --> 02:12:54,890
Okay.

3571
02:12:55,030 --> 02:12:55,870
There we go.

3572
02:12:56,470 --> 02:12:59,030
We're just gonna keep stocking boxes here.

3573
02:13:00,650 --> 02:13:03,350
No, nobody's buying my cheese anymore.

3574
02:13:04,090 --> 02:13:06,430
The cheese market crashed.

3575
02:13:10,490 --> 02:13:15,470
Oh, I can't believe we lived long enough to see the cheese market crashing.

3576
02:13:17,950 --> 02:13:19,730
Oh wait, I didn't see you there.

3577
02:13:23,770 --> 02:13:26,110
Guys, it's not too dark here, okay?

3578
02:13:26,170 --> 02:13:27,550
I just had my eyes closed.

3579
02:13:28,450 --> 02:13:29,270
It's so cold.

3580
02:13:30,670 --> 02:13:31,610
It's okay.

3581
02:13:32,210 --> 02:13:32,730
It's okay.

3582
02:13:33,130 --> 02:13:35,010
No, I can totally see!

3583
02:13:35,350 --> 02:13:36,750
My eyes were just closed.

3584
02:13:37,450 --> 02:13:38,910
Lord, thank you for the super chat.

3585
02:13:39,030 --> 02:13:39,730
Thank you, thank you.

3586
02:13:39,750 --> 02:13:42,550
Gotta manifest your destiny and get more oil.

3587
02:13:42,730 --> 02:13:44,230
Thank you for the super chat.

3588
02:13:44,330 --> 02:13:45,170
Thank you, thank you.

3589
02:13:45,990 --> 02:13:46,510
Alright.

3590
02:13:47,770 --> 02:13:49,070
I can't believe it.

3591
02:13:49,130 --> 02:13:50,370
The cheese bubble burst.

3592
02:13:50,630 --> 02:13:52,010
I can't believe it.

3593
02:13:52,330 --> 02:13:54,690
How will France sustain themselves now?

3594
02:13:54,870 --> 02:13:56,550
What else are they gonna export?

3595
02:13:59,290 --> 02:14:01,130
France, the city in America, of course.

3596
02:14:03,150 --> 02:14:06,710
I'm talking about the city of France in America.

3597
02:14:08,350 --> 02:14:09,130
Where's your hand?

3598
02:14:09,310 --> 02:14:10,010
There it is.

3599
02:14:11,510 --> 02:14:12,150
Oh, it's not.

3600
02:14:12,350 --> 02:14:13,450
Do you have anything you want to sell?

3601
02:14:13,590 --> 02:14:13,870
Okay.

3602
02:14:14,590 --> 02:14:15,350
Card, okay.

3603
02:14:16,270 --> 02:14:17,810
Nice, we're almost halfway there.

3604
02:14:19,030 --> 02:14:19,910
Little France.

3605
02:14:22,330 --> 02:14:23,210
Paris, Texas.

3606
02:14:23,430 --> 02:14:23,870
Exactly!

3607
02:14:25,370 --> 02:14:26,250
Somebody understands!

3608
02:14:27,690 --> 02:14:28,970
How much?

3609
02:14:30,210 --> 02:14:31,370
$372 profit!

3610
02:14:31,670 --> 02:14:33,890
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

3611
02:14:34,990 --> 02:14:38,970
Even with the oil situation, we did it.

3612
02:14:39,170 --> 02:14:39,710
Ah, shit.

3613
02:14:39,770 --> 02:14:40,050
Okay.

3614
02:14:41,150 --> 02:14:41,790
Um...

3615
02:14:41,790 --> 02:14:43,050
I...

3616
02:14:43,050 --> 02:14:44,310
What were the...

3617
02:14:46,070 --> 02:14:48,450
Okay, um...

3618
02:14:49,210 --> 02:14:49,730
Okay, guys.

3619
02:14:49,870 --> 02:14:51,630
What do I need to restock?

3620
02:14:51,930 --> 02:14:53,210
Okay, peanut butter.

3621
02:14:54,890 --> 02:14:56,090
Peanut butter.

3622
02:14:57,210 --> 02:14:57,770
Coffee.

3623
02:14:59,610 --> 02:15:00,170
Um...

3624
02:15:00,170 --> 02:15:01,150
Rice!

3625
02:15:01,430 --> 02:15:02,370
Rice went up!

3626
02:15:02,510 --> 02:15:03,430
Oh my God!

3627
02:15:04,490 --> 02:15:06,590
Who cares about fucking...

3628
02:15:06,590 --> 02:15:06,950
Oh, pasta.

3629
02:15:07,130 --> 02:15:07,550
I need pasta.

3630
02:15:08,550 --> 02:15:09,110
Pasta.

3631
02:15:11,910 --> 02:15:12,890
What else?

3632
02:15:12,990 --> 02:15:14,530
No, not the salt market!

3633
02:15:15,350 --> 02:15:15,910
No!

3634
02:15:16,430 --> 02:15:17,770
But how much?

3635
02:15:18,930 --> 02:15:20,550
Not the salt market!

3636
02:15:21,050 --> 02:15:22,190
It's fine, we'll keep it there.

3637
02:15:24,130 --> 02:15:26,070
I don't remember what I said.

3638
02:15:26,070 --> 02:15:27,590
What else do I have to stock up?

3639
02:15:27,850 --> 02:15:28,390
Okay.

3640
02:15:28,570 --> 02:15:29,110
Spaghetti.

3641
02:15:29,490 --> 02:15:30,330
Oh, the oil.

3642
02:15:30,570 --> 02:15:31,310
I need to remember the oil.

3643
02:15:32,270 --> 02:15:33,010
It's fine.

3644
02:15:33,510 --> 02:15:34,910
And then...

3645
02:15:35,870 --> 02:15:36,410
Rice.

3646
02:15:37,250 --> 02:15:38,930
Okay, rice is up now.

3647
02:15:40,690 --> 02:15:41,850
We don't... It's okay.

3648
02:15:42,150 --> 02:15:42,690
Uh...

3649
02:15:42,690 --> 02:15:44,490
This is stuff I still have.

3650
02:15:45,350 --> 02:15:45,890
Uh...

3651
02:15:45,890 --> 02:15:46,330
You know what?

3652
02:15:46,410 --> 02:15:47,250
We'll keep this.

3653
02:15:47,530 --> 02:15:48,930
And then... coffee.

3654
02:15:50,770 --> 02:15:51,310
Okay.

3655
02:15:52,690 --> 02:15:53,230
Restock.

3656
02:15:53,230 --> 02:15:55,870
Restock spot and the non-restock.

3657
02:15:56,010 --> 02:15:57,270
Uh... peanut butter.

3658
02:15:58,050 --> 02:15:59,510
And then we need...

3659
02:16:00,110 --> 02:16:00,930
We need pasta.

3660
02:16:01,270 --> 02:16:02,290
We need pasta!

3661
02:16:03,030 --> 02:16:03,350
Oil.

3662
02:16:04,190 --> 02:16:05,110
Okay, uh...

3663
02:16:05,110 --> 02:16:05,870
Pasta.

3664
02:16:06,910 --> 02:16:07,690
Where's pasta?

3665
02:16:08,550 --> 02:16:09,190
Pasta.

3666
02:16:09,750 --> 02:16:10,690
Where's pasta?

3667
02:16:10,850 --> 02:16:11,990
Where's my fucking pasta?

3668
02:16:12,390 --> 02:16:13,030
Alright, pasta.

3669
02:16:13,970 --> 02:16:15,230
And normal oil.

3670
02:16:16,330 --> 02:16:16,970
Alright.

3671
02:16:20,630 --> 02:16:21,830
I'm gonna go like this?

3672
02:16:21,970 --> 02:16:23,750
I don't have my minimum wage worker!

3673
02:16:23,750 --> 02:16:25,210
What am I supposed to do?

3674
02:16:26,890 --> 02:16:28,550
You think I'm throwing this at myself?

3675
02:16:29,190 --> 02:16:30,690
That's what the teenagers are for.

3676
02:16:31,510 --> 02:16:32,650
Oh, I already have...

3677
02:16:32,650 --> 02:16:33,910
Fuck you, you're in pot pasta!

3678
02:16:41,480 --> 02:16:41,920
Okay.

3679
02:16:43,760 --> 02:16:44,820
Alright, we're fine.

3680
02:16:45,840 --> 02:16:46,920
It's okay, here you go.

3681
02:16:48,920 --> 02:16:50,000
It's okay, we're fine.

3682
02:16:50,020 --> 02:16:50,300
We're fine.

3683
02:16:50,620 --> 02:16:52,040
Is there anything else we're missing?

3684
02:16:52,940 --> 02:16:54,080
What else are we missing?

3685
02:16:54,460 --> 02:16:56,420
My back stock is insane.

3686
02:16:56,420 --> 02:16:57,600
Flour!

3687
02:16:57,960 --> 02:16:58,560
Okay.

3688
02:16:58,920 --> 02:16:59,520
Flour.

3689
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:01,800
Alright.

3690
02:17:04,100 --> 02:17:04,700
Flour.

3691
02:17:05,340 --> 02:17:05,940
Bam.

3692
02:17:06,340 --> 02:17:07,400
Is there anything else?

3693
02:17:08,600 --> 02:17:09,200
Please.

3694
02:17:10,280 --> 02:17:11,640
It can go higher.

3695
02:17:16,320 --> 02:17:18,180
It can go higher.

3696
02:17:18,760 --> 02:17:19,360
Sugar?

3697
02:17:19,820 --> 02:17:20,700
Where's the sugar?

3698
02:17:20,840 --> 02:17:21,260
Oh yeah, sugar.

3699
02:17:22,500 --> 02:17:23,780
Okay, we have sugar.

3700
02:17:24,380 --> 02:17:25,160
Where's sugar?

3701
02:17:25,280 --> 02:17:25,660
Okay, here.

3702
02:17:26,420 --> 02:17:26,740
Anything else?

3703
02:17:26,880 --> 02:17:28,020
We don't have enough...

3704
02:17:28,020 --> 02:17:28,720
Okay, we can...

3705
02:17:28,720 --> 02:17:31,260
We'll put room temperature sugar until...

3706
02:17:31,260 --> 02:17:32,140
Oh, I have an idea!

3707
02:17:32,540 --> 02:17:32,980
Alright.

3708
02:17:33,860 --> 02:17:34,300
Okay.

3709
02:17:36,680 --> 02:17:37,840
Okay, I have an idea.

3710
02:17:38,060 --> 02:17:39,500
Do I have a milk box?

3711
02:17:44,340 --> 02:17:46,820
Do I have a milk box anywhere?

3712
02:17:51,280 --> 02:17:54,600
We'll put the eggs in there when we have enough room.

3713
02:17:54,600 --> 02:17:56,600
I'm not buying another fridge!

3714
02:17:56,720 --> 02:17:57,720
That's too much money!

3715
02:17:58,380 --> 02:17:59,460
Oh wait, that's used.

3716
02:17:59,660 --> 02:18:00,820
Okay, this can go higher.

3717
02:18:00,920 --> 02:18:01,300
There we go.

3718
02:18:01,540 --> 02:18:02,200
There we go.

3719
02:18:02,220 --> 02:18:02,600
We're ready.

3720
02:18:02,680 --> 02:18:03,620
We're ready for business.

3721
02:18:03,880 --> 02:18:05,040
We've restocked, I think.

3722
02:18:05,540 --> 02:18:06,900
Okay, I'm gonna double check.

3723
02:18:07,520 --> 02:18:09,620
Oil, water, peanut butter, flour...

3724
02:18:09,620 --> 02:18:11,040
Yeah, we stocked everything.

3725
02:18:11,360 --> 02:18:12,100
There you go.

3726
02:18:15,800 --> 02:18:16,280
Guys!

3727
02:18:17,180 --> 02:18:18,540
Stop judging me!

3728
02:18:20,240 --> 02:18:21,120
I'm just...

3729
02:18:21,120 --> 02:18:23,900
I'm just a single parent.

3730
02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:24,260
I'm just a single parent.

3731
02:18:24,260 --> 02:18:24,400
I'm just a single parent.

3732
02:18:24,400 --> 02:18:24,440
I'm just a single parent.

3733
02:18:24,440 --> 02:18:26,120
The doki amber does!

3734
02:18:26,520 --> 02:18:29,600
She try to make things work and have foods!

3735
02:18:30,200 --> 02:18:30,880
Like...

3736
02:18:35,260 --> 02:18:39,660
People don't care about what it looks like on the inside!

3737
02:18:40,120 --> 02:18:41,400
It's all about the...

3738
02:18:41,400 --> 02:18:42,220
...the food!

3739
02:18:42,780 --> 02:18:44,720
It's all about the food!

3740
02:18:50,260 --> 02:18:52,140
It's all about the food!

3741
02:18:55,260 --> 02:18:57,320
I have quality food!

3742
02:18:59,080 --> 02:18:59,640
Flower.

3743
02:19:00,480 --> 02:19:02,280
Boop boop boop boop boop boop boop.

3744
02:19:03,140 --> 02:19:03,700
Okay.

3745
02:19:03,700 --> 02:19:04,540
I almost...

3746
02:19:05,760 --> 02:19:06,540
Oh god.

3747
02:19:06,800 --> 02:19:08,220
I can't... this can be higher.

3748
02:19:08,660 --> 02:19:09,220
No!

3749
02:19:10,140 --> 02:19:11,320
This can be higher.

3750
02:19:11,400 --> 02:19:11,920
There you go.

3751
02:19:13,840 --> 02:19:14,400
Guys.

3752
02:19:14,680 --> 02:19:15,580
Go to you guys.

3753
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:16,400
Nice.

3754
02:19:16,560 --> 02:19:16,860
Okay.

3755
02:19:17,100 --> 02:19:18,520
Boop boop boop boop boop boop.

3756
02:19:20,700 --> 02:19:21,260
43.

3757
02:19:21,260 --> 02:19:22,380
We're almost...

3758
02:19:22,380 --> 02:19:23,960
The moment we hit level 9.

3759
02:19:24,400 --> 02:19:26,740
We're gonna go on a big sale guys.

3760
02:19:28,700 --> 02:19:30,300
We're gonna go on a big sale.

3761
02:19:30,380 --> 02:19:31,940
Speed run to level 10.

3762
02:19:33,680 --> 02:19:36,560
25.50 Alright.

3763
02:19:36,680 --> 02:19:37,120
Here we go.

3764
02:19:37,160 --> 02:19:37,700
This is good.

3765
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:38,160
This is good.

3766
02:19:38,240 --> 02:19:39,420
We need someone to buy more.

3767
02:19:40,860 --> 02:19:43,480
On this episode on hoarders.

3768
02:19:43,520 --> 02:19:45,660
We are toking with boxes.

3769
02:19:45,940 --> 02:19:47,660
This is not a choice.

3770
02:19:48,260 --> 02:19:50,680
This is not a choice.

3771
02:19:50,900 --> 02:19:51,420
Cruising.

3772
02:19:51,420 --> 02:19:52,360
Thank you for the support.

3773
02:19:52,380 --> 02:19:52,840
Super chat.

3774
02:19:52,920 --> 02:19:53,400
Thank you.

3775
02:19:53,460 --> 02:19:54,060
Thank you.

3776
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:55,620
It's not a choice.

3777
02:19:55,780 --> 02:19:56,880
It's a problem.

3778
02:19:58,260 --> 02:20:00,660
And I'm willing to admit it.

3779
02:20:05,820 --> 02:20:06,360
Okay.

3780
02:20:07,100 --> 02:20:07,640
Alright.

3781
02:20:07,800 --> 02:20:08,140
Let's see.

3782
02:20:08,340 --> 02:20:08,880
19.

3783
02:20:09,260 --> 02:20:09,800
Nice.

3784
02:20:09,860 --> 02:20:10,380
Plus 5.

3785
02:20:11,360 --> 02:20:11,900
Please.

3786
02:20:11,900 --> 02:20:14,420
We need you to get rid of the cheese and the milk.

3787
02:20:14,840 --> 02:20:15,920
So I can...

3788
02:20:15,920 --> 02:20:17,060
put the eggs.

3789
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:19,580
The eggs are at room temperature lady.

3790
02:20:19,740 --> 02:20:20,280
Please.

3791
02:20:22,380 --> 02:20:24,040
My eggs are at room temperature.

3792
02:20:24,060 --> 02:20:25,020
Someone please.

3793
02:20:25,600 --> 02:20:27,200
Take the... think of the eggs.

3794
02:20:28,560 --> 02:20:29,780
You never know.

3795
02:20:29,900 --> 02:20:30,220
Exactly.

3796
02:20:30,400 --> 02:20:31,720
You never know when you need a box.

3797
02:20:31,880 --> 02:20:32,380
Exactly.

3798
02:20:32,600 --> 02:20:33,600
Now we're thinking.

3799
02:20:34,260 --> 02:20:37,820
This is what happens when your streamer isn't forklift certified.

3800
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:41,760
Look.

3801
02:20:42,100 --> 02:20:43,680
I'm almost close to 1000.

3802
02:20:44,040 --> 02:20:44,440
OMG.

3803
02:20:44,580 --> 02:20:46,260
Look at all the stuff she's buying.

3804
02:20:46,740 --> 02:20:48,840
And she paid an exact...

3805
02:20:48,840 --> 02:20:50,940
That's the customer I like.

3806
02:20:52,380 --> 02:20:52,760
Oh my god!

3807
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:54,060
It's happening!

3808
02:20:57,460 --> 02:20:58,100
Guys!

3809
02:20:58,400 --> 02:20:59,660
We have eggs!

3810
02:21:00,420 --> 02:21:01,060
Finally!

3811
02:21:02,900 --> 02:21:03,460
There we go.

3812
02:21:05,720 --> 02:21:08,100
Oh my god, we finally have eggs.

3813
02:21:08,320 --> 02:21:09,140
It's happening.

3814
02:21:10,060 --> 02:21:11,140
It's fucking happening!

3815
02:21:12,120 --> 02:21:15,620
Oh my god, imagine a charger like $150.

3816
02:21:16,180 --> 02:21:17,420
Okay, we need water.

3817
02:21:19,920 --> 02:21:31,300
Oh my god, did you guys see that tweet of this manager in Japan that accidentally ordered 999 onigiris?

3818
02:21:33,860 --> 02:21:37,900
And he's like, please, it expires in one day.

3819
02:21:37,980 --> 02:21:40,460
We need people to buy onigiris.

3820
02:21:40,960 --> 02:21:42,780
That's gonna be me.

3821
02:21:44,200 --> 02:21:45,600
That's gonna be me.

3822
02:21:45,780 --> 02:21:47,320
I'm gonna accidentally use my...

3823
02:21:47,320 --> 02:21:50,940
entire savings and order like 999 eggs.

3824
02:21:51,700 --> 02:21:52,480
Oh shit.

3825
02:21:55,800 --> 02:21:57,260
Give me a sec, lady.

3826
02:21:57,320 --> 02:21:58,380
I'm trying to calculate.

3827
02:21:59,120 --> 02:21:59,960
Oh, thank you.

3828
02:21:59,980 --> 02:22:01,060
Thank you for buying...

3829
02:22:01,580 --> 02:22:02,400
buying our stuff.

3830
02:22:04,840 --> 02:22:06,140
Yeah, they actually did!

3831
02:22:06,300 --> 02:22:07,440
Because it went viral!

3832
02:22:07,600 --> 02:22:10,640
Because people were like, why the fuck do you have so much eggs?

3833
02:22:10,880 --> 02:22:12,300
Not eggs, only giri!

3834
02:22:13,260 --> 02:22:14,620
Like, people around...

3835
02:22:14,620 --> 02:22:17,300
Like, people in the area just went and helped this poor...

3836
02:22:17,320 --> 02:22:21,900
poor man who accidentally ordered 999 onigiris.

3837
02:22:23,340 --> 02:22:25,500
Alright, I'm gonna accidentally like...

3838
02:22:25,930 --> 02:22:28,020
buy more stock of things I never needed.

3839
02:22:29,620 --> 02:22:30,880
Oh wait, 7.

3840
02:22:31,120 --> 02:22:31,940
I see 7.

3841
02:22:32,140 --> 02:22:33,520
Okay, do I have bread?

3842
02:22:34,140 --> 02:22:35,520
There must... do I have...

3843
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:36,200
I have cheese.

3844
02:22:36,500 --> 02:22:37,620
Wait, I have cheese.

3845
02:22:37,760 --> 02:22:38,780
I know I have cheese.

3846
02:22:40,080 --> 02:22:40,940
There we go.

3847
02:22:41,060 --> 02:22:42,120
And then flour.

3848
02:22:42,880 --> 02:22:44,340
Okay, now I already have flour.

3849
02:22:44,880 --> 02:22:45,420
Okay.

3850
02:22:45,800 --> 02:22:46,340
Oil!

3851
02:22:47,320 --> 02:22:47,620
Nice.

3852
02:22:49,060 --> 02:22:49,540
Um...

3853
02:22:49,940 --> 02:22:50,900
Oh, I can rotate it!

3854
02:22:51,080 --> 02:22:52,100
Oh my god!

3855
02:22:52,160 --> 02:22:53,520
Oh, it changes everything.

3856
02:22:57,760 --> 02:22:59,300
This changes everything.

3857
02:22:59,380 --> 02:23:00,460
I can rotate...

3858
02:23:00,460 --> 02:23:00,560
No!

3859
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:02,520
Wait, there's stuff in this box.

3860
02:23:03,440 --> 02:23:04,980
Wait, there was stuff in this box.

3861
02:23:07,220 --> 02:23:07,940
There we go.

3862
02:23:08,880 --> 02:23:09,600
Okay, nice.

3863
02:23:09,900 --> 02:23:11,040
I had enough time.

3864
02:23:12,840 --> 02:23:13,800
19.5.

3865
02:23:14,300 --> 02:23:14,780
Okay.

3866
02:23:16,240 --> 02:23:16,720
Water.

3867
02:23:18,200 --> 02:23:18,700
Okay.

3868
02:23:18,840 --> 02:23:19,240
Okay.

3869
02:23:19,240 --> 02:23:19,720
Spaghet.

3870
02:23:21,820 --> 02:23:22,320
Spaghet.

3871
02:23:22,520 --> 02:23:22,640
Spaghet.

3872
02:23:22,640 --> 02:23:24,320
Do I have... do I need to put more flour?

3873
02:23:24,480 --> 02:23:24,660
No.

3874
02:23:24,840 --> 02:23:25,720
Flour is good.

3875
02:23:26,020 --> 02:23:26,800
What about salt?

3876
02:23:27,240 --> 02:23:28,780
Why does no one want the salt?

3877
02:23:28,900 --> 02:23:30,120
You need to season your food!

3878
02:23:31,160 --> 02:23:32,940
Please think about your seasoning!

3879
02:23:34,300 --> 02:23:34,800
30.

3880
02:23:35,620 --> 02:23:36,800
What in the...

3881
02:23:38,400 --> 02:23:39,100
Oh, nice.

3882
02:23:39,180 --> 02:23:39,960
Exact change.

3883
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:40,480
Okay.

3884
02:23:40,920 --> 02:23:42,800
Peanut butter and bread.

3885
02:23:43,060 --> 02:23:43,980
Do I have peanut butter?

3886
02:23:44,740 --> 02:23:46,000
Do I... do you need coffee?

3887
02:23:46,220 --> 02:23:46,520
Okay.

3888
02:23:46,660 --> 02:23:47,080
Coffee.

3889
02:23:47,980 --> 02:23:48,380
Okay.

3890
02:23:49,820 --> 02:23:50,220
Nice.

3891
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:51,440
Nice.

3892
02:23:51,680 --> 02:23:51,820
Oh.

3893
02:23:52,200 --> 02:23:52,720
Don't worry.

3894
02:23:53,120 --> 02:23:53,940
Don't worry, sir.

3895
02:23:56,620 --> 02:23:57,420
37.4.

3896
02:23:57,860 --> 02:23:58,260
Nice.

3897
02:23:58,380 --> 02:23:58,620
All right.

3898
02:23:58,640 --> 02:23:59,220
We need...

3899
02:23:59,220 --> 02:24:01,440
We need peanut butter and bread.

3900
02:24:02,280 --> 02:24:06,000
I'm a little concerned that my bread has been on that shelf for like four days now.

3901
02:24:06,100 --> 02:24:06,640
But it's okay.

3902
02:24:06,820 --> 02:24:07,220
It's okay.

3903
02:24:07,800 --> 02:24:09,620
People love it when it's a little stale.

3904
02:24:09,800 --> 02:24:12,160
If it's too soft, then it's for pussies.

3905
02:24:14,280 --> 02:24:15,000
Where's the door?

3906
02:24:15,780 --> 02:24:16,180
Where's the door?

3907
02:24:16,660 --> 02:24:17,060
Where's the door?

3908
02:24:18,520 --> 02:24:21,620
Everybody likes it when the bread is a little hard.

3909
02:24:22,620 --> 02:24:23,180
Guys.

3910
02:24:28,900 --> 02:24:29,460
Okay.

3911
02:24:29,860 --> 02:24:30,840
I think...

3912
02:24:30,840 --> 02:24:31,640
I think...

3913
02:24:31,640 --> 02:24:33,800
Where's the cashier entrance area?

3914
02:24:34,120 --> 02:24:34,540
There.

3915
02:24:34,980 --> 02:24:35,560
All right.

3916
02:24:38,080 --> 02:24:38,640
23.

3917
02:24:39,200 --> 02:24:39,760
Nice.

3918
02:24:42,120 --> 02:24:42,680
Okay.

3919
02:24:42,780 --> 02:24:43,300
Here we go.

3920
02:24:43,680 --> 02:24:44,720
1, 2, 3.

3921
02:24:45,260 --> 02:24:45,820
50.

3922
02:24:45,820 --> 02:24:46,360
60.

3923
02:24:47,420 --> 02:24:47,900
70.

3924
02:24:48,020 --> 02:24:48,200
80.

3925
02:24:48,300 --> 02:24:48,880
There you go.

3926
02:24:50,120 --> 02:24:51,000
What did you buy?

3927
02:24:51,180 --> 02:24:51,940
I can't tell.

3928
02:24:52,220 --> 02:24:53,120
What was that?

3929
02:24:54,600 --> 02:24:56,260
I see your items.

3930
02:24:57,020 --> 02:24:57,500
7.

3931
02:24:58,040 --> 02:24:58,520
25.

3932
02:24:59,420 --> 02:24:59,900
40.

3933
02:25:01,500 --> 02:25:01,980
45.

3934
02:25:02,040 --> 02:25:02,560
There you go.

3935
02:25:04,480 --> 02:25:05,280
Where's your card?

3936
02:25:05,460 --> 02:25:05,640
Okay.

3937
02:25:05,700 --> 02:25:06,000
There you go.

3938
02:25:06,020 --> 02:25:06,440
92.

3939
02:25:06,700 --> 02:25:07,680
Holy shit.

3940
02:25:08,680 --> 02:25:09,160
2.

3941
02:25:11,240 --> 02:25:11,720
There.

3942
02:25:11,840 --> 02:25:12,260
Nice.

3943
02:25:12,960 --> 02:25:13,440
Oh.

3944
02:25:13,460 --> 02:25:15,500
We got a big spender here.

3945
02:25:15,600 --> 02:25:15,800
Oh.

3946
02:25:15,820 --> 02:25:15,920
He's a personапroiftingsperson.

3947
02:25:16,300 --> 02:25:17,660
Providing for his family.

3948
02:25:18,960 --> 02:25:20,000
30.65.

3949
02:25:20,480 --> 02:25:21,000
Oh.

3950
02:25:21,040 --> 02:25:21,620
My god.

3951
02:25:22,160 --> 02:25:23,340
We're almost at level 9!

3952
02:25:25,340 --> 02:25:26,140
This is it.

3953
02:25:26,660 --> 02:25:27,180
Wait.

3954
02:25:27,320 --> 02:25:27,840
Lady.

3955
02:25:28,540 --> 02:25:29,860
Shop is done.

3956
02:25:30,760 --> 02:25:31,280
Oh.

3957
02:25:31,280 --> 02:25:32,040
You're just gonna come here.

3958
02:25:32,200 --> 02:25:33,000
The store is closed.

3959
02:25:33,140 --> 02:25:34,540
You're just gonna come here and fucking...

3960
02:25:35,320 --> 02:25:35,840
Fucking...

3961
02:25:35,840 --> 02:25:39,000
Talk about how fucking expensive my store is.

3962
02:25:39,300 --> 02:25:40,500
It's fucked up, man.

3963
02:25:40,760 --> 02:25:41,180
Wait.

3964
02:25:41,240 --> 02:25:42,140
I can keep making sales.

3965
02:25:43,120 --> 02:25:44,720
There's more people coming in.

3966
02:25:44,880 --> 02:25:45,140
I don't have enough money.

3967
02:25:45,420 --> 02:25:45,560
Why are people coming in?

3968
02:25:45,560 --> 02:25:45,800
Don't tell me.

3969
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,200
Oh my god, he bought all the oil!

3970
02:25:53,740 --> 02:25:56,180
The oil is still ready.

3971
02:25:57,200 --> 02:25:59,260
Alright, now we can end the day.

3972
02:26:02,140 --> 02:26:03,100
How much money?

3973
02:26:03,600 --> 02:26:05,280
Products found expensive, $31.

3974
02:26:05,580 --> 02:26:07,120
Well, we don't care about you.

3975
02:26:11,060 --> 02:26:12,640
No, my cheese!

3976
02:26:12,640 --> 02:26:13,360
Cheese!

3977
02:26:13,940 --> 02:26:15,820
Okay, my spaghetti is okay.

3978
02:26:16,640 --> 02:26:17,380
What is this?

3979
02:26:17,420 --> 02:26:17,740
Is this bread?

3980
02:26:18,160 --> 02:26:18,640
Okay.

3981
02:26:20,500 --> 02:26:20,980
Oh!

3982
02:26:22,160 --> 02:26:22,840
It's okay.

3983
02:26:23,920 --> 02:26:27,620
It's okay, we're gonna stack this nice and tall.

3984
02:26:30,140 --> 02:26:31,000
There we go.

3985
02:26:32,080 --> 02:26:34,120
We're gonna make sure...

3986
02:26:34,120 --> 02:26:34,540
No!

3987
02:26:36,280 --> 02:26:37,600
What is the physics?

3988
02:26:38,800 --> 02:26:39,280
Okay.

3989
02:26:39,540 --> 02:26:40,260
You know what?

3990
02:26:40,320 --> 02:26:40,720
That's fine.

3991
02:26:40,820 --> 02:26:41,140
Okay.

3992
02:26:42,640 --> 02:26:42,940
That's fine.

3993
02:26:43,040 --> 02:26:43,420
It's fine!

3994
02:26:43,540 --> 02:26:44,980
People can still walk around it!

3995
02:26:47,840 --> 02:26:48,940
Uh... Do I need flour?

3996
02:26:49,240 --> 02:26:49,560
I do.

3997
02:26:51,940 --> 02:26:52,540
There we go.

3998
02:26:52,700 --> 02:26:53,080
It's okay!

3999
02:26:53,240 --> 02:26:55,200
As long as people can walk around it, it's fine.

4000
02:26:58,280 --> 02:27:00,160
Uh... Do I need pasta?

4001
02:27:02,220 --> 02:27:03,700
No... Wait, is this not pasta?

4002
02:27:03,800 --> 02:27:04,400
What is this?

4003
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:06,540
What am I carrying?

4004
02:27:07,060 --> 02:27:07,820
Is this flour?

4005
02:27:08,240 --> 02:27:09,200
Did I run out of flour?

4006
02:27:09,660 --> 02:27:10,360
Oh, I did.

4007
02:27:11,380 --> 02:27:12,620
Oh my god, people love flour.

4008
02:27:12,640 --> 02:27:13,160
Okay.

4009
02:27:13,920 --> 02:27:16,440
Alright, we're gonna have our biggest sale.

4010
02:27:18,480 --> 02:27:20,300
The moment I can put this away.

4011
02:27:25,660 --> 02:27:29,740
Okay, we need to have a... People still need to be able to access the oil.

4012
02:27:30,960 --> 02:27:33,000
This is the second part of the gameplay.

4013
02:27:33,900 --> 02:27:36,840
I'm really paying you to do... Fine!

4014
02:27:38,500 --> 02:27:39,040
Fine!

4015
02:27:40,040 --> 02:27:41,020
There you go.

4016
02:27:41,160 --> 02:27:42,620
That's how much that's worth.

4017
02:27:44,120 --> 02:27:46,240
Thank you for the super chat.

4018
02:27:46,400 --> 02:27:47,440
Thank you, thank you.

4019
02:27:49,600 --> 02:27:53,500
That's the market value for me to throw away my box.

4020
02:27:53,720 --> 02:27:55,400
It's like the recycling fee, you know?

4021
02:27:55,440 --> 02:27:58,340
Like when you recycle a box, you get paid like...

4022
02:27:58,340 --> 02:28:03,220
Um... An amount for recycling... For bringing your recyclables over.

4023
02:28:08,990 --> 02:28:13,410
Yeah, like when you recycle bottles and fucking cardboard boxes.

4024
02:28:13,410 --> 02:28:16,530
Oh yeah, like in Germany, there's like these like machines.

4025
02:28:16,710 --> 02:28:20,570
I was like watching YouTube short and there's like this machine that like lets you...

4026
02:28:20,570 --> 02:28:24,250
That like basically you have to put... If you don't recycle it, you have to give the money.

4027
02:28:24,590 --> 02:28:27,890
You have to like... There's like a fee to pay if you don't recycle.

4028
02:28:28,370 --> 02:28:30,630
But then if you recycle, they give you money.

4029
02:28:31,070 --> 02:28:32,110
Please, the box...

4030
02:28:32,110 --> 02:28:33,730
It looks like my living room.

4031
02:28:33,970 --> 02:28:35,810
Oh yeah, another fee!

4032
02:28:36,110 --> 02:28:36,770
There you go.

4033
02:28:36,770 --> 02:28:37,650
Here's one box.

4034
02:28:37,870 --> 02:28:39,590
Thank you for the super chat.

4035
02:28:39,630 --> 02:28:40,810
Thank you, thank you.

4036
02:28:41,210 --> 02:28:41,650
Okay.

4037
02:28:42,030 --> 02:28:42,950
That is...

4038
02:28:42,950 --> 02:28:43,430
What was that?

4039
02:28:48,210 --> 02:28:49,650
Wait, what is this?

4040
02:28:49,790 --> 02:28:53,330
I don't... I don't remember what I have in my shop.

4041
02:28:53,630 --> 02:28:54,730
It's so long.

4042
02:28:54,950 --> 02:28:55,390
Oh, cereal!

4043
02:28:55,530 --> 02:28:56,270
It was the cereal!

4044
02:28:57,590 --> 02:28:58,190
Cereal...

4045
02:28:58,830 --> 02:28:59,950
We need more oil.

4046
02:29:01,690 --> 02:29:02,670
What do I need?

4047
02:29:02,870 --> 02:29:03,930
I don't remember.

4048
02:29:03,990 --> 02:29:05,390
There's too many items.

4049
02:29:05,490 --> 02:29:06,770
I'm getting confused.

4050
02:29:08,690 --> 02:29:09,290
Cereal...

4051
02:29:09,690 --> 02:29:10,550
Okay, we got cereal.

4052
02:29:11,270 --> 02:29:12,390
Do we have sugar?

4053
02:29:12,590 --> 02:29:13,310
We have sugar.

4054
02:29:14,290 --> 02:29:15,690
I'm getting too confused.

4055
02:29:15,770 --> 02:29:17,790
There's too many items in my fucking...

4056
02:29:20,310 --> 02:29:20,830
Okay.

4057
02:29:21,330 --> 02:29:23,890
I feel like there was something at the bottom there.

4058
02:29:24,010 --> 02:29:25,130
What the fuck was there?

4059
02:29:26,550 --> 02:29:28,170
I have boxes.

4060
02:29:30,990 --> 02:29:31,510
Okay.

4061
02:29:32,110 --> 02:29:33,010
There you go.

4062
02:29:34,070 --> 02:29:36,270
Please throw another one out.

4063
02:29:38,230 --> 02:29:39,930
Here for the super chat.

4064
02:29:39,930 --> 02:29:40,950
Thank you.

4065
02:29:41,030 --> 02:29:41,530
Thank you.

4066
02:29:42,050 --> 02:29:42,490
Okay.

Thank you.

4073
02:29:51,770 --> 02:29:52,210
Okay.

4074
02:29:52,350 --> 02:29:52,610
Fine!

4075
02:29:52,770 --> 02:29:53,950
You get two boxes!

4076
02:29:54,810 --> 02:29:56,290
You get two boxes.

4077
02:29:56,470 --> 02:29:56,910
Alright.

4078
02:29:57,690 --> 02:29:58,130
Alright.

4079
02:29:58,270 --> 02:29:59,370
What else in my...

4080
02:29:59,930 --> 02:30:00,830
Flower was at the...

4081
02:30:00,830 --> 02:30:01,730
But I already have a flower.

4082
02:30:02,050 --> 02:30:03,030
Do I have two flowers?

4083
02:30:03,130 --> 02:30:03,790
I have two flowers.

4084
02:30:04,810 --> 02:30:06,250
I think that was it, right?

4085
02:30:07,830 --> 02:30:09,330
I think that's everything.

4086
02:30:09,330 --> 02:30:11,430
That should be everything.

4087
02:30:11,730 --> 02:30:12,670
I'm pretty sure.

4088
02:30:13,190 --> 02:30:13,650
Wait.

4089
02:30:13,730 --> 02:30:14,570
I need to put more cheese.

4090
02:30:14,690 --> 02:30:15,390
I'm running out of cheese.

4091
02:30:16,490 --> 02:30:16,950
Wait.

4092
02:30:16,990 --> 02:30:17,370
Is it cheese?

4093
02:30:17,710 --> 02:30:18,310
Is that cheese?

4094
02:30:18,810 --> 02:30:19,270
Oh!

4095
02:30:19,270 --> 02:30:20,030
My eggs!

4096
02:30:21,410 --> 02:30:22,450
I forgot... Oh, wait.

4097
02:30:22,470 --> 02:30:22,570
No.

4098
02:30:22,590 --> 02:30:23,290
I already have eggs.

4099
02:30:23,390 --> 02:30:23,610
Okay.

4100
02:30:23,650 --> 02:30:23,970
Cheese.

4101
02:30:24,050 --> 02:30:24,650
I need cheese.

4102
02:30:25,190 --> 02:30:25,650
Alright.

4103
02:30:26,510 --> 02:30:26,970
Cheese.

4104
02:30:28,550 --> 02:30:29,350
There you go.

4105
02:30:29,810 --> 02:30:30,270
Okay.

4106
02:30:30,310 --> 02:30:31,030
We're gonna...

4107
02:30:33,230 --> 02:30:35,530
We're gonna do something wild here.

4108
02:30:35,950 --> 02:30:36,770
Alright, guys.

4109
02:30:37,110 --> 02:30:39,310
We're gonna go to our biggest cell yet.

4110
02:30:39,310 --> 02:30:39,630
Okay.

4111
02:30:40,190 --> 02:30:40,830
295.

4112
02:30:41,290 --> 02:30:41,930
Okay.

4113
02:30:42,050 --> 02:30:42,570
3.

4114
02:30:43,910 --> 02:30:44,550
Alright.

4115
02:30:44,610 --> 02:30:47,710
We're gonna make it so that we only make one dollar profit.

4116
02:30:48,010 --> 02:30:50,370
So we can speedrun to level 10.

4117
02:30:50,610 --> 02:30:51,150
I'm...

4118
02:30:55,490 --> 02:30:56,570
We're gonna...

4119
02:30:56,570 --> 02:30:58,790
We're gonna speedrun.

4120
02:30:59,230 --> 02:31:02,150
We're gonna speedrun this shit now.

4121
02:31:05,090 --> 02:31:05,730
Okay.

4122
02:31:05,930 --> 02:31:06,810
Let's see.

4123
02:31:08,050 --> 02:31:08,690
5.

4124
02:31:08,690 --> 02:31:09,090
5.

4125
02:31:09,890 --> 02:31:10,490
5.

4126
02:31:10,950 --> 02:31:12,030
There we go.

4127
02:31:13,530 --> 02:31:14,130
Please.

4128
02:31:14,810 --> 02:31:16,270
Buy my stuff!

4129
02:31:16,450 --> 02:31:18,650
It's so cheap now!

4130
02:31:20,990 --> 02:31:22,770
It's such a steal!

4131
02:31:25,190 --> 02:31:26,890
Buy my... Oh my god!

4132
02:31:26,990 --> 02:31:28,110
I was $10!

4133
02:31:28,170 --> 02:31:29,290
Oh my god.

4134
02:31:29,330 --> 02:31:30,590
My shit was so expensive.

4135
02:31:30,810 --> 02:31:31,330
Holy fuck.

4136
02:31:31,630 --> 02:31:34,050
No wonder people didn't wanna fucking shop here.

4137
02:31:36,510 --> 02:31:37,770
Biggest cell yet!

4138
02:31:39,770 --> 02:31:40,330
Buy!

4139
02:31:40,430 --> 02:31:40,790
Buy!

4140
02:31:40,910 --> 02:31:41,150
Buy!

4141
02:31:42,430 --> 02:31:42,990
4.

4142
02:31:44,030 --> 02:31:44,590
Okay.

4143
02:31:46,130 --> 02:31:46,690
6.

4144
02:31:49,330 --> 02:31:49,890
Please!

4145
02:31:49,930 --> 02:31:52,950
I'm begging you to rob me at this point!

4146
02:31:57,830 --> 02:31:58,390
Please!

4147
02:32:00,350 --> 02:32:02,090
This is highway robbery!

4148
02:32:02,710 --> 02:32:03,430
Oh, I need more flour.

4149
02:32:04,690 --> 02:32:06,190
Wait, do I have flour in here?

4150
02:32:06,450 --> 02:32:07,550
There's so many things.

4151
02:32:11,850 --> 02:32:15,210
I'm literally paying you guys to fucking rob me!

4152
02:32:16,330 --> 02:32:17,730
I bought the wrong flour.

4153
02:32:20,390 --> 02:32:22,550
Sorry, the flour was red.

4154
02:32:22,870 --> 02:32:24,450
There's too many flours!

4155
02:32:31,970 --> 02:32:32,570
Okay.

4156
02:32:33,610 --> 02:32:34,490
Here we go.

4157
02:32:35,710 --> 02:32:37,230
We're gonna put this here.

4158
02:32:37,350 --> 02:32:37,530
Okay.

4159
02:32:37,530 --> 02:32:39,850
We have our own stock now.

4160
02:32:40,950 --> 02:32:42,950
I'm gonna forget what I do have.

4161
02:32:43,110 --> 02:32:44,030
I'm pretty sure.

4162
02:32:44,910 --> 02:32:45,410
Come!

4163
02:32:46,650 --> 02:32:48,470
Carl, thank you for the super chat.

4164
02:32:48,570 --> 02:32:48,910
Thank you.

4165
02:32:48,910 --> 02:32:49,390
Thank you.

4166
02:32:49,490 --> 02:32:51,430
I'm robbing your store.

4167
02:32:51,830 --> 02:32:52,330
Please!

4168
02:32:54,390 --> 02:32:55,830
Put me out of business!

4169
02:33:00,510 --> 02:33:02,770
I'm letting you put me out of business!

4170
02:33:02,950 --> 02:33:04,370
Just get me out of here!

4171
02:33:05,270 --> 02:33:06,270
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

4172
02:33:06,350 --> 02:33:09,790
I'm not making you put me out of business that easily.

4173
02:33:10,790 --> 02:33:11,650
Seven dollars.

4174
02:33:12,410 --> 02:33:12,890
Alright.

4175
02:33:13,070 --> 02:33:15,890
I need to get that sugar in here.

4176
02:33:17,590 --> 02:33:18,070
Nice.

4177
02:33:19,130 --> 02:33:19,490
Okay.

4178
02:33:19,970 --> 02:33:21,290
Honestly, I don't know.

4179
02:33:21,830 --> 02:33:23,150
There's too many items here.

4180
02:33:23,290 --> 02:33:24,870
Why did I order so much peanut butter?

4181
02:33:25,850 --> 02:33:27,630
Why do I have so much peanut butter?

4182
02:33:29,930 --> 02:33:30,410
Alright.

4183
02:33:31,050 --> 02:33:31,530
Eighteen.

4184
02:33:33,650 --> 02:33:34,170
Nice.

4185
02:33:34,190 --> 02:33:35,830
Wait, did I exit paying or less?

4186
02:33:36,110 --> 02:33:36,510
No!

4187
02:33:40,890 --> 02:33:41,970
Guys, please!

4188
02:33:42,010 --> 02:33:43,890
I didn't mean to actually steal from me!

4189
02:33:46,450 --> 02:33:49,570
Guys, please!

4190
02:33:51,890 --> 02:33:54,230
Please come back and give me back the money!

4191
02:33:55,610 --> 02:33:56,130
Please!

4192
02:33:56,130 --> 02:33:58,170
I'm just a local business person.

4193
02:33:59,510 --> 02:34:00,030
Umm...

4194
02:34:00,030 --> 02:34:00,530
Okay.

4195
02:34:00,530 --> 02:34:00,990
I'm just gonna go ahead and go.

4196
02:34:01,530 --> 02:34:01,810
Flour.

4197
02:34:01,910 --> 02:34:02,870
I think it's this.

4198
02:34:05,070 --> 02:34:06,830
Okay, and then oil.

4199
02:34:07,830 --> 02:34:08,610
Oh no.

4200
02:34:09,370 --> 02:34:09,890
Water.

4201
02:34:11,330 --> 02:34:11,850
Okay.

4202
02:34:13,010 --> 02:34:13,530
Spaghet.

4203
02:34:15,710 --> 02:34:17,830
Please, I'm getting overwhelmed right now.

4204
02:34:22,950 --> 02:34:24,810
Thank you for the acasupa!

4205
02:34:24,990 --> 02:34:25,310
Thank you!

4206
02:34:26,990 --> 02:34:28,670
Acasupa for your taste in dog breeds.

4207
02:34:28,670 --> 02:34:30,570
Please give them to Pep for the random interest.

4208
02:34:30,690 --> 02:34:31,370
Thank you!

4209
02:34:31,370 --> 02:34:32,390
Thank you for the acasupa!

4210
02:34:32,510 --> 02:34:34,050
How do you say it's too expensive?

4211
02:34:34,630 --> 02:34:35,590
You're literally...

4212
02:34:35,590 --> 02:34:36,410
There's prop...

4213
02:34:36,410 --> 02:34:38,410
I'm literally asking you to steal from me.

4214
02:34:42,370 --> 02:34:45,510
This is almost the same price as Whole Foods!

4215
02:34:45,770 --> 02:34:47,070
Oh my god.

4216
02:34:47,130 --> 02:34:48,450
What do I need to restock?

4217
02:34:50,470 --> 02:34:50,970
350.

4218
02:34:54,230 --> 02:34:54,730
Okay.

4219
02:34:55,610 --> 02:34:56,110
$20.

4220
02:34:58,670 --> 02:35:00,350
Oh, that is a lot of stuff you're buying.

4221
02:35:01,470 --> 02:35:01,910
Water.

4222
02:35:03,610 --> 02:35:04,050
Okay.

4223
02:35:04,990 --> 02:35:05,850
Water is done.

4224
02:35:07,090 --> 02:35:07,530
Cheese.

4225
02:35:08,430 --> 02:35:09,430
Cheese is done.

4226
02:35:10,450 --> 02:35:11,110
This flower.

4227
02:35:11,390 --> 02:35:12,490
Oh, no one wants this flower.

4228
02:35:12,590 --> 02:35:13,410
No one likes that flower.

4229
02:35:13,590 --> 02:35:13,770
Okay.

4230
02:35:14,230 --> 02:35:14,670
Coffee!

4231
02:35:14,990 --> 02:35:15,730
Okay, we need coffee.

4232
02:35:17,330 --> 02:35:18,130
What do we need?

4233
02:35:20,910 --> 02:35:21,350
Coffee!

4234
02:35:22,430 --> 02:35:22,870
Tea!

4235
02:35:25,050 --> 02:35:25,490
Tea.

4236
02:35:26,810 --> 02:35:28,050
Please sir, wait a minute!

4237
02:35:28,110 --> 02:35:28,630
I'm getting...

4238
02:35:29,110 --> 02:35:29,570
Overwhelmed!

4239
02:35:29,890 --> 02:35:30,350
Tea!

4240
02:35:30,450 --> 02:35:30,830
Sugar!

4241
02:35:32,150 --> 02:35:32,610
Ah!

4242
02:35:34,450 --> 02:35:35,410
Yeah, that's it!

4243
02:35:36,590 --> 02:35:37,630
Oh my god, that's...

4244
02:35:39,050 --> 02:35:39,510
Okay.

4245
02:35:42,530 --> 02:35:42,990
Checkout.

4246
02:35:45,510 --> 02:35:46,370
Oh my god.

4247
02:35:46,950 --> 02:35:47,410
Please.

4248
02:35:48,310 --> 02:35:49,270
Okay, I need...

4249
02:35:49,270 --> 02:35:50,390
I need to stock up.

4250
02:35:50,850 --> 02:35:51,670
Where's the sugar?

4251
02:35:54,370 --> 02:35:55,430
Okay, get in here.

4252
02:35:56,010 --> 02:35:57,050
Fox, get in here!

4253
02:35:58,670 --> 02:35:59,270
Pasta!

4254
02:36:01,890 --> 02:36:02,870
Sir, please!

4255
02:36:03,710 --> 02:36:04,650
I'm sorry!

4256
02:36:07,950 --> 02:36:09,230
13.6.

4257
02:36:09,550 --> 02:36:10,790
Alright, one customer.

4258
02:36:11,010 --> 02:36:12,310
One restock.

4259
02:36:12,410 --> 02:36:13,010
Tea.

4260
02:36:16,210 --> 02:36:17,990
Nice, we're restocking everything.

4261
02:36:19,530 --> 02:36:20,790
And then...

4262
02:36:21,870 --> 02:36:22,510
Coffee!

4263
02:36:23,450 --> 02:36:24,610
Guys, do you guys want to look more?

4264
02:36:24,730 --> 02:36:26,390
Look at the beautiful things we have!

4265
02:36:26,870 --> 02:36:27,530
Do you want...

4266
02:36:27,530 --> 02:36:28,990
Do I look more to a shop more?

4267
02:36:29,370 --> 02:36:31,330
We got a recent restock!

4268
02:36:33,290 --> 02:36:35,090
Oh no, this is too big of a sale.

4269
02:36:35,270 --> 02:36:36,510
I was not...

4270
02:36:37,130 --> 02:36:39,270
I was not made for all this sale.

4271
02:36:42,210 --> 02:36:42,730
Okay.

4272
02:36:42,730 --> 02:36:43,250
Eggs.

4273
02:36:43,490 --> 02:36:43,910
Oh!

4274
02:36:44,630 --> 02:36:45,830
What am I missing?

4275
02:36:50,210 --> 02:36:51,850
Um... Where's my eggs?

4276
02:36:52,210 --> 02:36:54,210
We had sugar all this long?

4277
02:36:55,090 --> 02:36:55,490
Okay.

4278
02:36:56,190 --> 02:36:58,390
All this long I already had sugar.

4279
02:36:58,790 --> 02:36:59,050
Okay.

4280
02:37:00,650 --> 02:37:01,050
Flour!

4281
02:37:02,110 --> 02:37:03,330
We need the other flour!

4282
02:37:03,390 --> 02:37:04,450
We need the rich man flour!

4283
02:37:06,030 --> 02:37:07,270
Wait no, that's pasta.

4284
02:37:08,510 --> 02:37:09,170
There you go.

4285
02:37:10,610 --> 02:37:11,010
Okay.

4286
02:37:11,550 --> 02:37:12,750
Where's the rich man flour?

4287
02:37:13,850 --> 02:37:14,250
Water.

4288
02:37:14,330 --> 02:37:15,830
Oh, there's too much of a line!

4289
02:37:20,210 --> 02:37:21,230
Oh my god.

4290
02:37:22,010 --> 02:37:23,710
This is not going so well, guys.

4291
02:37:25,430 --> 02:37:26,910
Okay, one dollar.

4292
02:37:27,150 --> 02:37:27,830
Nice.

4293
02:37:28,230 --> 02:37:29,270

Card.

4295
02:37:30,430 --> 02:37:31,350
19.

4296
02:37:32,670 --> 02:37:35,690
I liked it better when my store wasn't accessible.

4297
02:37:37,490 --> 02:37:45,790
When my store was harder to afford.

4298
02:37:46,890 --> 02:37:47,930
Okay.

4299
02:37:48,230 --> 02:37:49,310

4304
02:37:55,610 --> 02:37:57,410

4306
02:38:00,550 --> 02:38:00,990
Ah!

4307
02:38:01,110 --> 02:38:01,650

4308
02:38:01,990 --> 02:38:02,430
Flour!

4309
02:38:02,610 --> 02:38:04,130
Oh, let's just put in two flours.

4310
02:38:04,190 --> 02:38:05,410
I don't need all that flour.

4311
02:38:06,030 --> 02:38:07,090
Yeah, more sugar!

4312
02:38:08,190 --> 02:38:09,050
More sugar!

4313
02:38:09,210 --> 02:38:10,430
We don't need all that.

4314
02:38:13,730 --> 02:38:14,170
Ah!

4315
02:38:16,790 --> 02:38:17,390

4316
02:38:17,550 --> 02:38:18,150
Is this salt?

4317
02:38:18,850 --> 02:38:19,610
What is this?

4318
02:38:19,970 --> 02:38:20,930
What am I holding?

4319
02:38:21,170 --> 02:38:22,070
Is this peanut butter?

4320
02:38:22,190 --> 02:38:23,250
Okay, peanut butter is here now.

4321
02:38:24,210 --> 02:38:24,390

We're halfway to level 10!

4326
02:38:39,210 --> 02:38:41,230
We're so close to level 10!

4327
02:38:41,850 --> 02:38:46,450
18.05 Is that cash?

4328
02:38:46,810 --> 02:38:47,570
Okay, 73.

4329
02:38:47,950 --> 02:38:49,990
Oh, that's not... No, that's not right.

4330
02:38:51,910 --> 02:38:52,230
Okay.

4331
02:38:54,290 --> 02:38:55,230
Uh... $2.

4332
02:38:56,410 --> 02:38:57,930
Anyone want more stuff?

4333
02:38:58,490 --> 02:38:59,630
Where's the restock?

4334
02:38:59,790 --> 02:39:00,590
I don't know.

4335
02:39:00,650 --> 02:39:01,270
You go here.

4336
02:39:02,350 --> 02:39:03,770
Do I have more items?

4337
02:39:03,910 --> 02:39:04,390

One peanut butter!

4340
02:39:09,410 --> 02:39:11,750
Do I have anything else in the corner?

4341
02:39:11,990 --> 02:39:12,910
I don't think so.

4342
02:39:13,130 --> 02:39:13,830
We're good.

4343
02:39:14,330 --> 02:39:15,050
We're good.

4344
02:39:15,470 --> 02:39:15,950

Is that everybody?

4354
02:39:40,490 --> 02:39:41,870
Oh my god, is that it?

4355
02:39:42,050 --> 02:39:42,830
Am I free?

4356
02:39:44,470 --> 02:39:47,030
No, I put so many boxes.

4357
02:39:47,390 --> 02:39:49,050
Thank you, Super Chat.

4358
02:39:49,490 --> 02:39:50,450

02:39:56,710 --> 02:39:57,010
Alright.

4362
02:39:57,010 --> 02:39:59,410
This is fine.

4363
02:39:59,650 --> 02:40:00,790
This is...

4364
02:40:00,790 --> 02:40:02,070
This is fine.

4365
02:40:02,790 --> 02:40:06,070
This is absolutely fine.

4366
02:40:06,830 --> 02:40:07,510
Okay.

4367
02:40:08,410 --> 02:40:09,090

Red pasta.

4375
02:40:20,670 --> 02:40:21,350

4378
02:40:24,410 --> 02:40:25,070
Oh my god!

4379
02:40:25,070 --> 02:40:27,090
There's nothing left in my fridge!

4380
02:40:28,130 --> 02:40:29,010
Bottled water.

4381
02:40:29,010 --> 02:40:29,390

4384
02:40:32,330 --> 02:40:34,110
I'm adding two of each.

4385
02:40:34,330 --> 02:40:35,850

Alright.

4437
02:41:44,180 --> 02:41:45,330
Milk at the bottom.

4438
02:41:46,430 --> 02:41:47,990
Alright, and then...

4439
02:41:47,990 --> 02:41:48,910
And then...

Okay, we're gonna put like unopened ones here.

Okay, flour.

4449
02:42:07,510 --> 02:42:09,150
Alright, flour goes here.

4450
02:42:09,530 --> 02:42:11,030
That's an empty box, right?

4451
02:42:11,150 --> 02:42:11,790
Yeah, it is.

4452
02:42:11,790 --> 02:42:12,190
It's empty.

4453
02:42:13,430 --> 02:42:14,310
Okay, milk.

4454
02:42:14,650 --> 02:42:18,030

So I know it's unopened.

4457
02:42:19,570 --> 02:42:20,930
We have a system.

4458
02:42:20,930 --> 02:42:24,190
Guys, we have a system now.

4459
02:42:25,010 --> 02:42:25,650
Guys...

4460
02:42:27,990 --> 02:42:29,550
This is our system.

4461
02:42:29,650 --> 02:42:30,730
It's gonna work.

4462
02:42:31,450 --> 02:42:32,590
Okay, cereal.

4463
02:42:33,570 --> 02:42:36,610
Like, customers don't care about what it looks like.

4464
02:42:36,730 --> 02:42:37,030
Okay?

4465
02:42:37,850 --> 02:42:39,190
Customers do not care.

4466
02:42:42,990 --> 02:42:46,470
As long as they can get their daily necessities.

4467
02:42:47,430 --> 02:42:49,130
That's all that matters.

4468
02:42:50,270 --> 02:42:50,910
That's all that matters.

4469
02:42:51,970 --> 02:42:52,970
Okay, flour.

4470
02:42:53,370 --> 02:42:55,170
Okay, we have unopened flour.

4471
02:42:56,030 --> 02:42:56,770
Okay, salt.

4472
02:42:58,030 --> 02:42:58,470
Cereal.

4473
02:42:59,750 --> 02:43:00,190
Alright.

4474
02:43:01,490 --> 02:43:02,110
It's fine.

4475
02:43:02,330 --> 02:43:02,870
Where am I?

4476
02:43:02,990 --> 02:43:04,790
Oh my god, I teleported right in there.

4477
02:43:06,030 --> 02:43:06,470
Alright.

4478
02:43:09,810 --> 02:43:10,250
Rice.

4479
02:43:12,210 --> 02:43:12,910
Restock central.

4480
02:43:14,770 --> 02:43:15,730
Uh, oil.

4481
02:43:16,770 --> 02:43:17,370
Oh wait.

4482
02:43:17,510 --> 02:43:18,810
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4483
02:43:18,930 --> 02:43:20,230
No, this had to be unopened.

4484
02:43:21,070 --> 02:43:21,670
Um...

4485
02:43:21,670 --> 02:43:22,870
This other oil.

4486
02:43:23,050 --> 02:43:24,650
Okay, the other oil we don't need yet.

4487
02:43:25,310 --> 02:43:25,910
Coffee.

4488
02:43:26,050 --> 02:43:26,350
Okay.

4489
02:43:28,090 --> 02:43:29,870
We don't need a storage room!

4490
02:43:30,730 --> 02:43:33,210
We do not need the extra space!

4491
02:43:33,490 --> 02:43:36,250
We have all the necessary space we need!

4492
02:43:38,250 --> 02:43:39,150
It's fine!

4493
02:43:40,830 --> 02:43:41,750
It's fine!

4494
02:43:43,690 --> 02:43:45,050
Okay, peanut butter.

4495
02:43:45,350 --> 02:43:46,610
Peanut butter goes here.

4496
02:43:47,570 --> 02:43:48,170
Hahahaha!

4497
02:43:49,510 --> 02:43:50,110
Hahahaha!

4498
02:43:52,730 --> 02:43:54,730
This is all the space we need!

4499
02:43:55,070 --> 02:43:55,850
It works!

4500
02:43:55,970 --> 02:43:56,910
It just works!

4501
02:43:57,410 --> 02:43:58,750
It just works!

4502
02:43:59,850 --> 02:44:02,350
Okay, and then we'll put the cereal here.

4503
02:44:02,850 --> 02:44:05,510
And then the cheese goes here.

4504
02:44:05,990 --> 02:44:06,470
And then the cheese goes here.

4505
02:44:06,470 --> 02:44:07,670
Thank you for the cereal, chat.

Everything just works!

4509
02:44:13,630 --> 02:44:14,650
Who the fuck?

4510
02:44:14,710 --> 02:44:15,910
Okay, here we go.

4511
02:44:17,310 --> 02:44:17,790
Alright.

4512
02:44:18,090 --> 02:44:19,250
And then... You know what?

Oh, Doki, please!

We need money!

4525
02:44:39,210 --> 02:44:39,950
We need to make money!

4526
02:44:40,070 --> 02:44:41,770

Alright.

4535
02:45:01,110 --> 02:45:04,610
I love my having my eggs in the sun for like five minutes.

4536
02:45:05,350 --> 02:45:06,850
That sounds ideal.

4537
02:45:07,190 --> 02:45:11,150
Please release me from the dirtiest boxes!

4538
02:45:11,910 --> 02:45:12,590

It's... It's like Costco, guys!

4548
02:45:29,910 --> 02:45:32,310
It almost feels just like Costco.

4549
02:45:37,690 --> 02:45:38,070
Okay.

It is!

4596
02:47:17,330 --> 02:47:18,390
Where's my peanut butter?

4597
02:47:19,110 --> 02:47:21,050
I know I had a lot of peanut butter!

4598
02:47:22,710 --> 02:47:23,990
Where's my peanut butter?

02:47:27,250 --> 02:47:27,810
That's flour.

02:47:28,430 --> 02:47:30,230
Where did all my peanut butter go?

4602
02:47:32,430 --> 02:47:32,990
Okay...

4603
02:47:33,630 --> 02:47:34,750
Where did it all go?

4604
02:47:35,430 --> 02:47:36,950
I'm gonna put this away, though.

4605
02:47:38,550 --> 02:47:39,110
Ugh...

4606
02:47:39,770 --> 02:47:40,330
Okay...

Ugh...

4609
02:47:43,770 --> 02:47:45,170
And the milk.

4610
02:47:46,690 --> 02:47:48,550
Y'all can put all that milk away.

4611
02:47:49,230 --> 02:47:49,910
It's okay.

4612
02:47:50,390 --> 02:47:51,990
It's okay, everything is fine.

02:47:52,830 --> 02:47:54,090
Everything is fine.

02:47:54,170 --> 02:47:55,510
I know I bought more!

4615
02:47:58,350 --> 02:48:00,390
It's okay, we're almost at level 10!

4616
02:48:02,690 --> 02:48:04,730
We're almost at level 10, guys!

4617
02:48:06,810 --> 02:48:07,330
Cereal.

4618
02:48:07,930 --> 02:48:10,050
Someone just bought one cereal, that's okay.

4619
02:48:10,490 --> 02:48:11,370
You do you.

4620
02:48:11,370 --> 02:48:12,470
Rice.

4621
02:48:13,130 --> 02:48:14,430
Oh my God.

That's okay, we're almost at level 10!

4627
02:48:34,010 --> 02:48:35,130
We're almost there!

4628
02:48:38,350 --> 02:48:39,590
Okay, 6.

02:48:41,850 --> 02:48:43,030
We did it!

4631
02:48:43,070 --> 02:48:45,570
We can hire our middle-waged teenager!

4632
02:48:46,170 --> 02:48:47,790
Oh my god, I need to pay my bills too.

4633
02:48:48,070 --> 02:48:49,110
Okay, where are you?

4634
02:48:49,130 --> 02:48:49,510
Hiring.

4635
02:48:50,190 --> 02:48:51,570
We did it!

4636
02:48:51,830 --> 02:48:52,850
Do your job!

4637
02:48:52,910 --> 02:48:54,270
I just need a stock!

4638
02:48:54,910 --> 02:48:55,990
Stock, stock, stock!

4639
02:48:59,850 --> 02:49:01,810
Oh my god, it's finally here!

4640
02:49:03,310 --> 02:49:04,830
It's finally here!

4641
02:49:10,850 --> 02:49:15,530
Everything we worked for... is here!

4642
02:49:18,130 --> 02:49:19,250
Oh my god!

4643
02:49:19,910 --> 02:49:21,370
We did it!

4644
02:49:22,170 --> 02:49:23,610
This worked for me.

4645
02:49:24,090 --> 02:49:24,750
Yes.

4646
02:49:25,230 --> 02:49:26,470
Keep working.

4647
02:49:27,730 --> 02:49:30,530
I... what do I need a stock for?

4648
02:49:31,150 --> 02:49:33,390
Just put more bread, I don't care at this point.

4649
02:49:36,410 --> 02:49:37,910
Do I need eggs?

4650
02:49:38,090 --> 02:49:38,570
Eggs?

4651
02:49:38,590 --> 02:49:39,270
I think I need eggs.

4652
02:49:40,230 --> 02:49:41,050
Don't worry.

4653
02:49:42,410 --> 02:49:43,290
Everything's fine.

4654
02:49:44,110 --> 02:49:44,670
Milk.

4655
02:49:44,730 --> 02:49:46,010
I think we need more milk, right?

4656
02:49:46,690 --> 02:49:48,190
Yeah, we need more milk.

4657
02:49:51,970 --> 02:49:55,070
Now I can do what I've always wanted to do.

4658
02:49:55,490 --> 02:49:57,370
Start stacking this better.

4659
02:50:01,030 --> 02:50:07,070
Now I have more time for what I'm actually passionate about.

4660
02:50:11,400 --> 02:50:12,680
Okay, okay.

4661
02:50:12,960 --> 02:50:16,600
Okay, TM, because I don't want to get sued after 081 box.

4662
02:50:16,940 --> 02:50:17,800
You know what?

4663
02:50:17,980 --> 02:50:22,140
In celebration, we can turn on the lights now.

4664
02:50:23,180 --> 02:50:24,300
Rejoice, everybody!

4665
02:50:24,980 --> 02:50:26,960
Today is a celebration!

4666
02:50:32,240 --> 02:50:36,060
In celebration, we can turn on the lights!

4667
02:50:40,480 --> 02:50:42,040
Go, Jerry!

4668
02:50:42,320 --> 02:50:42,660
Go!

4669
02:50:43,980 --> 02:50:45,720
Wait, is that Elon Musk?

4670
02:50:48,600 --> 02:50:55,900
Before he invented... before he was a rich kid, Pia King was my cashier.

4671
02:50:56,620 --> 02:50:57,900
This is it!

4672
02:50:57,900 --> 02:50:58,620
Announcement!

4673
02:51:00,460 --> 02:51:01,220
Announcement.

4674
02:51:01,300 --> 02:51:07,100
We have decided... the company has decided to get rid of all natural light.

4675
02:51:07,100 --> 02:51:12,060
And decided to cater to the... to the light people.

4676
02:51:16,600 --> 02:51:21,540
We have decided to cater to the people that have been demanding for lights.

4677
02:51:21,800 --> 02:51:26,360
So I apologize to all the light sensitive folks out there.

4678
02:51:26,900 --> 02:51:28,240
It was just more money.

4679
02:51:28,440 --> 02:51:32,080
Like we just... there was just more people that are not light sensitive.

4680
02:51:32,280 --> 02:51:34,520
So we just cater for more money.

4681
02:51:34,580 --> 02:51:35,280
We sold out.

4682
02:51:35,640 --> 02:51:36,880
All in all...

4683
02:51:37,100 --> 02:51:40,100
Ever since I got my minimum wage teenager...

4684
02:51:40,100 --> 02:51:41,340
We sold out.

4685
02:51:48,080 --> 02:51:51,660
Mr. Broken Bond, thank you, thank you for the super chat.

4686
02:51:53,620 --> 02:51:58,320
I need to make some artwork of Doki trying to juggle the box with that check.

4687
02:51:58,840 --> 02:51:59,740
It's fine!

4688
02:52:00,940 --> 02:52:02,220
I did it!

4689
02:52:03,500 --> 02:52:05,100
We did it, guys!

4690
02:52:07,100 --> 02:52:08,000
I ran out of turnip oil.

4691
02:52:08,200 --> 02:52:08,620
Oh no.

4692
02:52:09,280 --> 02:52:11,820
Now I can put more boxes away.

4693
02:52:12,920 --> 02:52:14,260
We did it, everybody!

4694
02:52:15,100 --> 02:52:18,080
Oh my god, we finally did it!

4695
02:52:20,740 --> 02:52:22,680
I had a dream...

4696
02:52:23,280 --> 02:52:27,120
To open the best Whole Foods out there.

4697
02:52:27,500 --> 02:52:29,280
And I think I did it.

4698
02:52:29,480 --> 02:52:31,000
I think I made it.

4699
02:52:31,420 --> 02:52:33,200
I think I made it.

4700
02:52:33,200 --> 02:52:36,560
I think I made it.

4701
02:52:36,560 --> 02:52:38,440
Good job, I think it was the super chat thing.

4702
02:52:38,460 --> 02:52:39,200
Thank you!

4703
02:52:43,340 --> 02:52:46,720
You know I think that is a good time.

4704
02:52:47,740 --> 02:52:52,660
I think this is a good way to call it for this game.

4705
02:52:55,740 --> 02:52:59,480
I think we made a lot of progress, you know?

4706
02:52:59,540 --> 02:53:00,260
In general.

4707
02:53:00,640 --> 02:53:03,860
I honestly think we did really good today.

4708
02:53:09,360 --> 02:53:10,360
Okay.

4709
02:53:10,360 --> 02:53:11,160
GG's everybody!

4710
02:53:12,800 --> 02:53:13,800
GG's!

4711
02:53:13,800 --> 02:53:14,920
Not gonna lie!

4712
02:53:15,520 --> 02:53:18,200
Honestly, I think my best...

4713
02:53:18,200 --> 02:53:21,860
The best store I've ever opened.

4714
02:53:22,080 --> 02:53:29,020
Oh my god.

4715
02:53:30,380 --> 02:53:30,780
Oh!

4716
02:53:32,380 --> 02:53:35,260
I had to leave like three times in anxiety!

4717
02:53:35,940 --> 02:53:37,000
What do you mean?

4718
02:53:37,740 --> 02:53:38,780
It was perfect!

4719
02:53:39,920 --> 02:53:41,920
I think I knew how to run a store.

4720
02:53:42,180 --> 02:53:45,700
I think I knew how to run a perfect grocery market.

4721
02:53:49,240 --> 02:53:50,380
Devlin, thank you for the super chat.

4722
02:53:50,460 --> 02:53:51,060
Thank you, thank you.

4723
02:53:51,100 --> 02:53:51,840
I just posted.

4724
02:53:51,920 --> 02:53:54,660
Your box situation is still not as bad as mine.

4725
02:53:55,040 --> 02:53:56,600
Devlin, thank you for the super chat.

4726
02:53:56,720 --> 02:53:57,160
Thank you, thank you.

4727
02:53:57,160 --> 02:53:57,800
What do you mean?

4728
02:53:59,020 --> 02:53:59,800
What do you mean by that?

4729
02:53:59,960 --> 02:54:02,340
What the fuck did you do to your store?

4730
02:54:02,760 --> 02:54:03,960
Holy fuck!

4731
02:54:04,240 --> 02:54:06,200
I thought you meant in-game!

4732
02:54:07,260 --> 02:54:07,980
Bro!

4733
02:54:09,860 --> 02:54:14,140
Look, I have in-game problems.

4734
02:54:14,320 --> 02:54:16,540
This is IRL problems.

4735
02:54:17,740 --> 02:54:19,100
Oh my god!

4736
02:54:19,880 --> 02:54:20,600
Bro!

4737
02:54:20,820 --> 02:54:22,260
Are you okay?

4738
02:54:22,900 --> 02:54:24,660
Are you okay, man?

4739
02:54:24,760 --> 02:54:29,000
For those who know what the fuck he sent, this is...

4740
02:54:29,020 --> 02:54:30,320
Oh shit, wait.

4741
02:54:30,460 --> 02:54:32,760
This is what he sent me.

4742
02:54:33,700 --> 02:54:34,220
Like...

4743
02:54:37,880 --> 02:54:40,800
I thought you meant in-game!

4744
02:54:41,600 --> 02:54:43,520
I thought you meant in-game.

4745
02:54:44,820 --> 02:54:46,700
Oh my god, this is too real!

4746
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:47,740
Too real!

4747
02:54:48,880 --> 02:54:50,320
Oh my god!

4748
02:54:51,560 --> 02:54:52,560
Oh my god!

4749
02:54:52,960 --> 02:54:54,520
DM, thank you for the super chat.

4750
02:54:54,640 --> 02:54:54,900
Thank you.

4751
02:54:55,360 --> 02:54:56,920
You made a hill of boxes.

4752
02:54:56,940 --> 02:54:57,720
This is what you made.

4753
02:54:57,800 --> 02:54:58,900
Thank you for the super chat.

4754
02:54:59,020 --> 02:54:59,460
Thank you.

4755
02:54:59,480 --> 02:55:00,200
Thank you.

4756
02:55:00,980 --> 02:55:01,800
Uh, man!

4757
02:55:02,460 --> 02:55:04,580
Corporate corruption has fines for real though.

4758
02:55:04,620 --> 02:55:05,480
Nice work, boss.

4759
02:55:05,580 --> 02:55:06,460
Thank you for the super chat.

4760
02:55:06,540 --> 02:55:06,820
Thank you.

4761
02:55:06,820 --> 02:55:07,340
Thank you.

4762
02:55:08,220 --> 02:55:08,700
Um...

4763
02:55:10,480 --> 02:55:11,840
But yeah, that was fun!

4764
02:55:12,160 --> 02:55:13,080
That was really fun.

4765
02:55:13,620 --> 02:55:19,080
Not gonna lie, I feel like this is a game you can easily just autopilot to and just like...

4766
02:55:19,080 --> 02:55:20,780
Like, and just like...

4767
02:55:20,780 --> 02:55:21,760
Uh, like...

4768
02:55:21,760 --> 02:55:26,320
Seven hours can easily pass through just playing this game.

4769
02:55:26,320 --> 02:55:27,020
Cause it...

4770
02:55:27,740 --> 02:55:36,820
It's such an autopilot game that I feel like you can easily just have seven hours disappear so fast if you just play it non-stop.

4771
02:55:37,160 --> 02:55:38,220
Yeah, it's just fun!

4772
02:55:38,360 --> 02:55:40,240
I had a lot of fun ta- yeah, I had...

4773
02:55:40,240 --> 02:55:42,060
Um, I had a lot of fun playing it.

4774
02:55:42,380 --> 02:55:43,780
Uh, GoldenDragon, thank you for the super chat.

4775
02:55:43,820 --> 02:55:44,100
Thank you.

4776
02:55:44,140 --> 02:55:44,540
Thank you.

4777
02:55:44,580 --> 02:55:46,480
At least you're not like Asmongold trash everywhere.

4778
02:55:46,600 --> 02:55:47,240
Thank you for the super chat.

4779
02:55:47,360 --> 02:55:47,560
Thank you.

4780
02:55:47,580 --> 02:55:47,760
Thank you.

4781
02:55:47,760 --> 02:55:49,260
I've not seen xQc's room.

4782
02:55:49,740 --> 02:55:54,480
That man had like... put like carpet next to his like exposed GPU.

4783
02:55:55,220 --> 02:55:55,540
Like...

4784
02:55:56,320 --> 02:55:57,440
I mean like...

4785
02:55:58,160 --> 02:55:59,280
You know what I mean?

4786
02:55:59,320 --> 02:56:04,260
He had like months old chicken um, like underneath his desk.

4787
02:56:04,380 --> 02:56:07,760
I was there when I watched his livestream of him trying to build his PC.

4788
02:56:08,080 --> 02:56:09,620
That shit was scary.

4789
02:56:10,060 --> 02:56:14,960
Like, he like... he like sat on a chair made of Pepsi boxes.

4790
02:56:15,440 --> 02:56:16,720
Or was it Coke boxes?

4791
02:56:16,860 --> 02:56:17,880
One or the other.

4792
02:56:18,040 --> 02:56:20,140
This man is a millionaire.

4793
02:56:20,540 --> 02:56:25,300
And he fucking sat on a chair made of Coke boxes.

4794
02:56:25,480 --> 02:56:25,960
Like...

4795
02:56:26,320 --> 02:56:26,460
What?

4796
02:56:27,020 --> 02:56:29,380
Like Coca Cola boxes?

4797
02:56:32,300 --> 02:56:33,960
Oh my god.

4798
02:56:34,220 --> 02:56:34,980
Bro.

4799
02:56:35,160 --> 02:56:37,120
That shit is insane.

4800
02:56:37,240 --> 02:56:38,860
Oh my god.

4801
02:56:42,880 --> 02:56:43,940
Oh yeah.

4802
02:56:44,100 --> 02:56:44,700
Oh yeah.

4803
02:56:45,900 --> 02:56:48,000
I take out my trash?

4804
02:56:48,560 --> 02:56:49,880
What do you mean?

4805
02:56:50,300 --> 02:56:53,380
I actually... I actually go outside my room.

4806
02:56:54,740 --> 02:56:56,820
And that's the extent for what... for a bit.

4807
02:57:00,060 --> 02:57:00,860
And that's the extent for what...

4808
02:57:00,860 --> 02:57:00,860
for a bit.

4809
02:57:00,860 --> 02:57:01,440
Alright guys.

4810
02:57:01,640 --> 02:57:01,860
Alright guys.

4811
02:57:01,860 --> 02:57:03,360
I'm gonna call it here everybody.

4812
02:57:03,680 --> 02:57:06,420
I hope you guys had a fun time hanging out with me.

4813
02:57:06,960 --> 02:57:09,040
Tomorrow is another rest day.

4814
02:57:09,320 --> 02:57:12,640
And um, I'm gonna be doing... getting a lot of work done today and tomorrow.

4815
02:57:13,060 --> 02:57:17,080
Cause I need to figure out who's gonna be joining Amelie and I for the...

4816
02:57:17,080 --> 02:57:18,240
for our collab game.

4817
02:57:18,440 --> 02:57:19,260
But yeah, thank you guys!

4818
02:57:19,420 --> 02:57:20,140
I had a great time.

4819
02:57:21,200 --> 02:57:21,560
Um...

4820
02:57:22,100 --> 02:57:23,160
Asasi, thank you for the super chat.

4821
02:57:23,220 --> 02:57:23,820
Thank you, thank you.

4822
02:57:23,860 --> 02:57:26,760
As a person who was PC Tech, remind me to never watch XQC.

4823
02:57:26,900 --> 02:57:28,240
The stories are nearing man.

4824
02:57:28,340 --> 02:57:29,480
Thank you for the super chat.
