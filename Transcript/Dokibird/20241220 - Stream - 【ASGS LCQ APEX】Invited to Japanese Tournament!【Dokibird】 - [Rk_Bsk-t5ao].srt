1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
I'm scuffed too, don't worry.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,280
Woah, I don't even see him.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,780
Yeah, I don't see you, Gerard.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:06,760
Where are you?

5
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,680
Are you in the right lobby?

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,100
I'm in the wrong lobby.

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,900
I sent you to go.

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,940
Look at Discord DMs.

9
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,380
They're gonna start this without you.

10
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,320
Oh no.

11
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,340
It's in...

12
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,700
Oh, Gerard.

13
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,560
Are you in?

14
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:26,840
Gerard?

15
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,740
I think I am.

16
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,900
I'm team number 8 right here.

17
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,760
Yeah, but do you see me in Flame?

18
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,120
Do you see me in...

19
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,300
I think you're in the wrong lobby, Gerard.

20
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,660
I think you're in the other lobby.

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,540
I don't think you're in lobby A.

22
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,480
This is the code.

23
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,220
I also sent him the code too.

24
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,560
I think he's in lobby B.

25
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,140
I don't know.

26
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,280
Doki...

27
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,720
I don't know about today, man.

28
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,960
My teammate can't get in the lobby.

29
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,460
Her teammate can't get in the lobby.

30
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,160
I also porn.

31
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,800
Did you say you just also porn your game?

32
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,580
How do you join lobby B?

33
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,540
How do you do that?

34
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,480
There's literally one code.

35
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,720
How do you get lobby B?

36
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,080
Wait.

37
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,820
Where did you get to lobby B?

38
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,800
I don't even know how you could access lobby B.

39
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,580
I only see lobby A.

40
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,060
Where are you?

41
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,960
Where are you?

42
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,620
I alt-F4.

43
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,220
Wait, I'm going to launch the game.

44
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,780
You're alt-F4?

45
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,820
They started abruptly.

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,940
I couldn't leave.

47
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,480
I couldn't leave.

48
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,520
Wait, they started?

49
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,040
How did they start?

50
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,220
I don't know.

51
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,320
We were supposed to start two minutes ago.

52
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,780
It wasn't me.

53
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,780
It wasn't me.

54
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,460
Oh my god.

55
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,100
I don't know.

56
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,020
We're so scuffed.

57
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,760
They're like, we're never inviting the English speaking team again.

58
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,160
I didn't mean it!

59
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,940
I didn't mean it!

60
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,380
Oh god.

61
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,800
This is turning out so fucking horribly.

62
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,520
This is like the sign.

63
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,940
I think we're the 20th place in doors.

64
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,800
No, 19th!

65
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,700
19th!

66
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,760
Any team that's below us should be ashamed of themselves after that.

67
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,880
Wait, Troy, are you in?

68
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,640
I'm opening the lobby.

69
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,480
There we go.

70
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,500
Are you still in the wrong lobby?

71
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,400
I don't see you.

72
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,700
Private match.

73
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,460
Private match.

74
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,120
Okay.

75
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,960
Join match.

76
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,560
Oh my god, there you are.

77
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,480
I'm going live right now.

78
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,680
I'm going live right now.

79
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,820
There you are.

80
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,480
Apologize right now in the chat.

81
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,800
Tell them you went to lobby.

82
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:12,440
I'm live now.

83
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,400
I clicked go live.

84
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,180
Okay.

85
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,180
Oh, they're starting right away.

86
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,780
They're starting right off.

87
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,600
Okay.

88
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,280
Okay, this is like three minutes late.

89
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,060
So you're going to get this in three minutes chat.

90
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,900
But Gerard...

91
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,160
Gerard actually joined lobby B.

92
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,540
Lobby A.

93
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,740
Also, like, I don't know how loud my teammates are.

94
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,720
So if they're too loud, we'll figure this out after the game.

95
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,640
Oh my god, immediately after starting the fucking tournament, I already fucked up.

96
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,160
No!

97
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,720
Gerard, where's Gerard Piquin?

98
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,020
Gerard Piquin left, Gerard Piquin left!

99
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,760
Piquin, Piquin!

100
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,640
What happened?

101
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,100
Jesus Christ, hello everybody.

102
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,320
Welcome to the stream.

103
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,440
Today I'm joined by Strafing and also DokiBurn.

104
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,040
Hello everybody.

105
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,220
God, this is such a bad start.

106
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,680
Jesus Christ.

107
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,300
We might be coming 20th place today, but at least we'll have fun.

108
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,420
If we get to winner's bracket, we don't have to play another set.

109
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,980
Just saying, I'm just saying.

110
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,560
If we get top 10, we don't have to play another six.

111
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,080
Oh, it is the official!

112
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,360
This is not my fault, this is all Doki's fault.

113
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,820
You invited me last minute!

114
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,760
You said yes, you said yes.

115
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,480
By the way, I asked Gerard, like...

116
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,260
You said yes, but I didn't think...

117
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,200
I was like, what do you mean?

118
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,540
I explained everything so perfectly clear.

119
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,440
I'm on here.

120
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,300
Guys, loot!

121
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
It's time to loot!

122
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,540
I'm joining, okay, okay.

123
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,340
I'm looting, I'm looting.

124
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,080
Mastiff is still strong, right?

125
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,120
Okay.

126
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:52,980
We're fine.

127
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,420
Okay, for those who don't know, Flame, he's our pro player and he went to ALGS championship.

128
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,680
And so, we believe in him so hard and there's no pressure at all.

129
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,920
I don't believe in myself right now.

130
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,840
We got you, we got you.

131
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,600
We got you, we got you.

132
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,640
You gotta believe.

133
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,680
If you don't believe in us, who's gonna believe in us?

134
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,300
Yeah, who is?

135
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,940
There's no one else but us!

136
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,280
I don't know.

137
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:29,380
I think the worst part is that you could have just not ulted for it.

138
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,440
It's a different team, I didn't know!

139
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,000
They started rolling, I'm spamming leave button and they wouldn't let me.

140
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,540
I panicked, okay?

141
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,520
I panicked, I didn't know what to do.

142
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,780
I must have took somebody else's spot and I felt so bad, I panicked, I'm sorry.

143
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,060
Wait, that means someone else was late.

144
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,120
Yeah!

145
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,740
Someone else was late, you took their spot and they started because of that.

146
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,360
Dude, everyone's names were like fucking Japanese.

147
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,520
Why do you think that's us?

148
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,600
I mean, I saw it!

149
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,720
I saw it!

150
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,920
IGL, where do you think zone's gonna end?

151
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,800
I don't know.

152
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,720
Wait, you're not the...

153
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,200
Okay.

154
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,760
We will have console.

155
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,800
We have the people ring, but we can't scan that yet.

156
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,840
Nah, we can't.

157
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,460
We have to pick between the UAV or the console.

158
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,360
So where should we go?

159
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,240
I think we're going to Barrow here so we can hit the console.

160
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,460
If we go into Echo, we won't have enough to get blue.

161
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,180
Alright.

162
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,000
We have to be a little bit slow.

163
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,180
Don't be in the front, Gerard.

164
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,920
I can take him.

165
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,000
Be in the middle between us.

166
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,560
Let's go over here and do the spiders.

167
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,880
We have to wait for Barrow to rotate out.

168
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,500
Yeah, yeah.

169
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,980
Alright, Gerard.

170
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,520
I need you to be in the middle.

171
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,800
Actually, no, you can be in the back.

172
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,220
It'll be fine.

173
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,080
I think I'll be the best.

174
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,080
Do you want me to do the spiders now?

175
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,780
Yeah, we can do the spiders.

176
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,620
I'll do the spiders now then.

177
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,800
Alright, yeah.

178
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,980
I understood what happened.

179
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,260
I understood what you guys said.

180
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,480
Totally fine.

181
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,460
Shoot the spiders.

182
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,060
That's all you have to do.

183
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

184
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,680
I'm doing great.

185
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,560
I'm shooting the spiders.

186
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,560
Yeah, that's good.

187
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,680
I'm so proud of you.

188
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,120
Oh my god, I think we can make it.

189
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,580
I think we can make it to the finals, bro.

190
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,120
I think we can get...

191
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,560
At least one knock.

192
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,360
That's my goal.

193
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,480
At least one knockdown.

194
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,600
Or at least a shot.

195
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,820
I never actually hit anybody.

196
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,560
Oh, no, you shouldn't.

197
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,620
Let's be realistic with our expectations here, Gerard.

198
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,920
Don't aim for something you can't...

199
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,960
Gerard, Gerard, come back.

200
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,460
Get this helmet.

201
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:46,940
Blue helmet.

202
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,820
I'll watch over him.

203
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,600
I'm going to shoot the dragon.

204
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,780
Okay, there we go.

205
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,000
Also, chat, I told...

206
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,440
I told Flam that I haven't touched Apex in two weeks, but instead I touched Marble Rivals, so my aim is still good.

207
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:04,720
Dang.

208
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,860
I'm envious of what you guys have.

209
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,400
The last time I touched this thing was during tournaments only.

210
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:12,980
Yeah.

211
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,200
I'll open it.

212
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,180
I'll get it.

213
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,300
Someone needs to sit up top and just look around.

214
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,940
Yeah, Gerard, just sit up top.

215
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,620
Okay, if you die, just scream.

216
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,400
There's like...

217
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,980
I'm always screaming.

218
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,660
That's like the only thing I can say.

219
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,720
Just scream at us if you die.

220
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,720
Sure, sure.

221
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,120
I'll try my best.

222
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:40,660
Do you want me to do Swift Shield or Heal's Hustle?

223
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,180
I don't remember which one was the right pick.

224
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,180
I think...

225
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,340
Swift Shield.

226
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,820
The one that gives you better cooldown.

227
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,640
Yeah, it increases the cooldown?

228
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,080
Okay.

229
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,040
I know there was a team here.

230
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,440
I think they rotated out already.

231
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

232
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,820
I think they rotated really fast.

233
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,760
Alright, tell Gerard what to upgrade.

234
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,620
Oh my god.

235
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,640
Car, car, car.

236
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,780
Shoot the car, shoot the car.

237
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,800
Oh, they're really far.

238
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,480
You want to come to us, Gerard?

239
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,340
That's why they don't see you.

240
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,500
I'm on my way, I'm on my way.

241
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,620
I'm so far away.

242
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,020
I cracked one, I cracked one.

243
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,620
Great job team, great job team.

244
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,540
Yeah, it's all team effort.

245
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,340
That's good, that's good.

246
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,220
I believe in you.

247
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,680
Moral support, moral support.

248
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,680
Alright, good job, Gerard.

249
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,500
You were there.

250
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,040
Yeah, I was there.

251
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,760
Moral support.

252
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,040
Without me, you guys are nothing.

253
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:37,880
Just saying.

254
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,880
Gerard, would it be fucked up if I packed your scope from you?

255
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,920
Do you have a scope to run?

256
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,160
Scope?

257
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:44,800
Uh, yes.

258
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:45,600
Do you?

259
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,620
What scope do you have on?

260
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,180
Wait, where'd it go?

261
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,460
I just threw it on the floor.

262
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,360
I know, where the fuck did it go?

263
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,860
Yeah, that's fine, that's fine.

264
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,100
Let's just go, let's just go.

265
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,180
Let's just go, guys.

266
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,720
Take it, oh my god, it's right on the floor!

267
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,320
Gerard, that's fine, that's fine.

268
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,640
I'm gonna shoot this dragon.

269
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,360
Take it, take it, take it.

270
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,760
Here, take it, take it.

271
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,300
Thank you very much, Gerard.

272
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,280
I'm gonna die anyway!

273
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,160
Where are they?!

274
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,300
Let's go over here.

275
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,540
We'll rotate into launch pad here.

276
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,860
Wait for ring three and then maybe go up here.

277
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,160
I believe in you.

278
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,620
Yeah, yeah, keep on believing.

279
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,340
We gotta be careful of the left here, yeah?

280
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:31,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

281
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,780
There might be a team coming up.

282
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,020
Uh...

283
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,660
I think we'll go back to spiders.

284
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,200
We didn't finish spiders, did we?

285
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,480
No, wait, did we not?

286
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,400
Oh, we must have missed one.

287
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,260
Yeah, we left the spider.

288
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,320
I mean, we're gonna go back anyway.

289
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,080
What does it do when we kill all the spiders?

290
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,340
We get more armor points.

291
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,020
Oh, okay.

292
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,340
There's people there, there's people, there's people!

293
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,860
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

294
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,840
There is people there.

295
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,120
Don't worry, we got this.

296
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,240
We got this.

297
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,640
These guys can aim.

298
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,540
Oh yeah, well, we can aim.

299
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,400
Look at me.

300
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,280
Look at me.

301
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,300
They're pushing up, they're pushing up.

302
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,140
I got them!

303
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,480
Just heal, just heal, just heal.

304
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,660
He's one, he's one.

305
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,880
Yeah, I distracted him.

306
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:20,740
Distracted him.

307
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,760
Give me on the rock.

308
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,900
He's one, this guy's one.

309
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,160
He's getting shot behind, he's getting shot behind.

310
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,320
He got knocked, he got knocked.

311
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,600
Gibby's still here, he's still down here.

312
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,660
I'm getting a side angle.

313
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,440
He's good, go, go, go, go!

314
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,440
I'm pushing this.

315
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,420
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.

316
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,920
I think we got backup, the other team's pushing up.

317
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,840
The other team's pushing up.

318
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,820
Make sure you're behind cover.

319
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,100
Get behind cover.

320
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,200
Just heal, just heal, droid.

321
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,260
Press Q.

322
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,640
Okay, that's fine, I can ulti you whenever.

323
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,720
I'm checking, I'm checking them.

324
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:56,940
Um...

325
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,900
There's a team right here, there's a team right here.

326
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,260
I can throw a Q.

327
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,040
Just run over here.

328
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,520
I'm trying to cover you.

329
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,580
That's fine, you're fine, you're fine.

330
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,100
Just heal, just heal, just heal, just heal.

331
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,940
I'll cover him, I'll cover him, I'll cover him.

332
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,000
That's fine, that's fine.

333
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,900
Just full heal, full heal.

334
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,200
You're doing great, you're doing great.

335
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,900
Doing great, doing great, surviving so far.

336
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,360
Where do we go?

337
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,420
Should we go back to the inn?

338
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,400
Let's just go here.

339
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,960
Just run, just run.

340
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,040
Come with us, come with us.

341
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,780
There's a team that did ring over here.

342
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,420
I saw the notification.

343
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,780
Okay, alright, alright.

344
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,920
Okay, they just rezzed.

345
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,720
I think that's the team that we killed.

346
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,660
We're gonna hit this console here and then try and make our way into zone.

347
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,460
Do you want me to get stronghold or ultimate savior?

348
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,760
The castle wall or regen?

349
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,100
The shield regen.

350
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,240
Alright, tell Jiraiya what he needs to do.

351
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,040
Oh wait, you're not purple yet, so you're fine.

352
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,600
I have no idea what you just said.

353
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,980
It's okay, just listen.

354
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,200
Just listen.

355
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,440
I'm trying, but I don't know fucking shit.

356
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,020
You're doing great, you're doing amazing.

357
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,580
You're doing so well.

358
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,180
It's fine, it's fine.

359
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,100
I believe in you.

360
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,400
Just calm down, breathe in.

361
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,640
Just fast, fast, follow me.

362
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,260
No hesitation.

363
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,400
No looting, just follow me.

364
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just follow him.

365
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, here, do you need shield?

366
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,900
Here, take a bat if you need it.

367
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,660
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

368
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,420
I'm over to mid, okay?

369
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,460
You might have to shield me here.

370
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,920
I'm not sure if it's safe.

371
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,780
I think it is.

372
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,540
Yeah, I think it should be okay.

373
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,420
Alright, I'll cover you.

374
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,320
I think you'll be fine.

375
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,160
I think you're fine.

376
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,380
We have a three minute delay.

377
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,380
What stream sniping would they do?

378
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,020
What?

379
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,160
They would, they would.

380
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,660
I don't know, we'll find something out.

381
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,580
I'm going to poke them.

382
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,160
We're just going to sit here and look behind us for now.

383
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm poking them so they won't...

384
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,240
You guys just double sit on the rock there.

385
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,140
And look over.

386
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,420
I'm checking my right side.

387
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:12,480
Okay.

388
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,700
I only have 100 ammo for light.

389
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,660
So I'm going to try and see if I can find more light.

390
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,000
Here, here.

391
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,620
Shoot it, shoot it.

392
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,480
They're not going on it.

393
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,320
Shoot it up, shoot it up.

394
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,980
Yeah, they couldn't get it.

395
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,580
Where are they, where are they?

396
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,840
I have the Lifeline 50, we can get these kills here.

397
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,180
Yeah, they're rotating.

398
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,780
Yeah, just shoot them.

399
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,920
That's a blue zipline, we can shoot that zipline.

400
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:44,780
Oh my god.

401
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,840
Okay, I need a reload.

402
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,180
Oh my god, he's so low.

403
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,880
He's so low.

404
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,760
He has Lifeline.

405
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:53,900
No.

406
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,860
I almost cracked him.

407
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,140
Gerard, careful, you're in the open.

408
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,640
It's fine.

409
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,260
They lost meds though for it.

410
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,200
We might still be able to kill this team if there's nothing over at these houses.

411
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:05,480
Yeah.

412
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,340
Come here, Gerard.

413
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,860
Just one fucking hit, I swear to god.

414
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,120
Just one hit.

415
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,800
I've done nothing.

416
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,120
I'm gonna open this bin for us.

417
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,340
Yeah, there's people over at the building, we just have to chill.

418
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,040
Oh, there's like health pack and bat.

419
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:19,860
I'm looking to my right.

420
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,340
We're gonna be playing through an evac here.

421
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,920
And we're gonna land like kind of in the middle of ring here.

422
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:25,380
Okay.

423
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,220
One of these spots, and then you just have the new castle like slammed on us.

424
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,100
Alright, yeah.

425
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,260
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

426
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,380
You'll be fine, I believe, you're so healthy.

427
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,620
Yeah, I'm healthy for now.

428
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,100
Let's do it a little bit early, maybe.

429
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,720
How much light do you have, Doki?

430
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,640
I have...

431
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,360
I have 102, but Gerard has more light ammo.

432
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,520
So I can moosh off of him.

433
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,560
I'm giving you 40 here.

434
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,080
I'm gonna throw these bats.

435
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,860
I'm gonna throw these bats.

436
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,040
So you can take them if you want it.

437
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,160
Okay, come to me, guys.

438
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,040
Yeah, I'm here.

439
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,960
I'm just carrying everything.

440
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:00,980
Yes, ma'am.

441
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,380
Yes, sir.

442
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,140
I got everything.

443
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,260
Follow us, follow us.

444
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,880
I have to throw a Q for our...

445
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,760
Just hit this right away.

446
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,120
Just follow us, just follow us.

447
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,540
Fly right and then left.

448
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,840
Just follow...

449
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,200
Land right here in this red corner here.

450
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,240
Yeah, and then I'll...

451
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,460
Other corner, other corner.

452
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,360
It's safe.

453
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:21,900
Do I need it all?

454
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,280
What?

455
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,060
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.

456
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,460
We don't need him, right?

457
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,500
It's okay, it's okay.

458
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:29,760
How?

459
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,900
Don't worry, don't worry about it.

460
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,800
They're running towards me.

461
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,060
We just have to relax.

462
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,220
Okay, just relax.

463
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,660
We need to look out for replicator drops here.

464
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:41,900
Okay.

465
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,700
Have a replicator land somewhere near us so we can try and craft it.

466
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,300
Yeah, I have rez on me too.

467
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,140
We're just chilling for now.

468
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,660
Your valuable teammate is right behind you.

469
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,260
Gerard, it's time.

470
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,200
It's time for you to learn today.

471
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,840
Don't worry, we can pick it.

472
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,000
We're not last, Gerard.

473
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,340
We're not last!

474
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,800
That's great, great progress.

475
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,200
Way better than last time.

476
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,220
Really great.

477
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:05,560
I'm looking.

478
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,020
As expected, I'm the first one to die.

479
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,040
I'm looking.

480
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,780
I don't have an angle.

481
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,840
At best, I can shoot the roof.

482
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,640
Yeah, let's just pray for them.

483
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,440
Pray for them, everybody.

484
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,080
They're doing so great.

485
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,120
Thank you for the morals.

486
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,500
Thank you, Gerard.

487
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,680
We really appreciate it.

488
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,340
Fine, fine.

489
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:26,740
I'm looking.

490
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,600
They're all doing so great without me.

491
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,620
I think I'm beginning to think that I'm the one holding them down.

492
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,540
No, no, you're like our moral support.

493
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,660
Oh yeah, you're right, you're right, you're right.

494
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

495
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,780
On this rock here, Lifeline.

496
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,380
Yeah, I see.

497
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,240
I don't see them though.

498
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,320
They're fighting up here.

499
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,440
Should I look?

500
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,780
Or do I want to stay here?

501
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,240
Stay, stay, stay.

502
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,140
Ooh.

503
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,320
I have a lot of bats though, if you need any.

504
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,120
Yeah, we're okay for now.

505
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,000
If they fight over at the left here, we have to try and wrap the third.

506
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:57,720
Okay.

507
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:58,920
I'm looking.

508
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,580
I think we have to go.

509
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,020
Come, come, come.

510
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,360
Go through the bottom.

511
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,860
I think I heard someone healing on me.

512
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,800
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

513
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:06,220
No.

514
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:08,660
Okay.

515
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,120
Stay in the corner.

516
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:12,620
I'm gonna swap this.

517
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,360
We just keep wrapping left here, I think.

518
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,260
Okay.

519
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,740
Team right here.

520
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,720
Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe.

521
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,480
Do we go back to our corner?

522
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,080
I think we just move over to this corner.

523
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:23,560
No, no, no.

524
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,300
We go over here.

525
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:25,800
Just run and climb.

526
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,500
Run, climb, run.

527
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:29,820
You okay?

528
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,420
I'm looking for you.

529
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,520
Don't drop resins here.

530
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,780
Good job, good job, good job.

531
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,260
I have ult, I have ult, I have ult.

532
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,020
Stay in that corner.

533
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:42,380
We need to walk into this close side of the zone on the left here.

534
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,080
I agree, I agree with whatever you said.

535
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,720
I'm pretty sure there's another team over at the right.

536
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,040
I'll stay here, I'll stay here just in case.

537
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,400
Wait, no, they're fighting, they're fighting.

538
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,080
Go, go, go, go.

539
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,500
On me.

540
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,480
One, dead.

541
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,400
On my right, on my right.

542
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,100
There's more teams coming.

543
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,380
Yeah, we have to chill.

544
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,320
Careful, careful.

545
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,860
It's a full team and a solo.

546
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,580
Full team and a solo.

547
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,120
We have to kill this full team.

548
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,880
I'm healing, I'm healing.

549
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,580
I'm all here.

550
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,300
I'm pushing the truck.

551
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,000
Kill the guy.

552
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,000
I get there, I get there.

553
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,680
Oh my god.

554
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,380
What the fuck?

555
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,840
What the fuck?

556
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,440
It's fine, it's fine.

557
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,460
Just play your life, play your life.

558
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,260
What the fuck?

559
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,750
I slammed and then I...

560
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,860
I got slammed back.

561
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,020
Oh god, oh man.

562
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,360
I believe in you to play your life.

563
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,140
That was a crazy slam that they did.

564
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,800
Okay, Strafing, you got this, Strafing!

565
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,580
I believe in you, Flame.

566
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:49,780
You...

567
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,120
You're so good at this game, Flame.

568
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,800
We're not last because of you, Flame.

569
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,360
Just remember.

570
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,480
Okay, okay, okay.

571
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,920
We gotta let him think.

572
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,440
These guys focus up.

573
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

574
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:02,700
Okay.

575
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,640
What the fuck was playing Mirage?

576
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:07,740
Nice.

577
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,800
Nice, nice!

578
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,200
Nice!

579
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,600
Oh my god!

580
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,540
Oh my god!

581
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,800
You're so awesome!

582
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,040
You're so great!

583
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,040
He's insane.

584
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,060
He's insane.

585
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,320
He's actually insane.

586
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,600
Nice, nice, nice!

587
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,200
I think that's the only team in front of you right now.

588
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,240
Yeah.

589
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,260
Oh my god.

590
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:44,740
Nobody knows.

591
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,440
Do they still have the highlight on?

592
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,740
This is nerve-wracking.

593
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,740
Dude, there's so many people.

594
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,420
There's so many people around you.

595
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,340
There's so many shooting at you.

596
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,180
Oh wait, no, no, no.

597
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,120
Okay, no one's shooting at you.

598
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,240
Oh my god.

599
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,900
This team under me has to die though.

600
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,900
Don't worry, they must die.

601
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,560
There's no way they're gonna let them rotate so free.

602
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,640
They're at the bottom.

603
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,200
Oh my god!

604
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:12,920
Nice, nice, nice!

605
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,140
Shit!

606
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,820
Oh my god, there's another team walking to your right.

607
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,860
Oh no.

608
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,360
They all want a piece of you.

609
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:24,500
Oh!

610
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,240
Oh, this is rad!

611
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,420
You're just staying low!

612
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,700
Great, seven squads remaining!

613
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,040
In between enemies!

614
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,060
Just inside the ring!

615
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,840
Nobody knows this!

616
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:44,780
Shh, shh.

617
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,040
He's gotta listen to the sound.

618
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,360
He's gotta listen to the footsteps behind him.

619
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,940
Oh my god.

620
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,960
I hope your skin blends in with the leaves or something.

621
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:01,840
Amen.

622
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,620
Amen, amen!

623
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,200
Oh my god, the catalyst!

624
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,340
Oh my god, top six!

625
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,520
Holy shit!

626
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,580
Top six!

627
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,260
Oh my god!

628
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,460
Oh my god!

629
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,300
Top five?!

630
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,300
Top five!

631
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,300
We're getting carried so hard!

632
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,060
I'm getting carried so hard!

633
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,120
No, Flame, don't do it!

634
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,400
Don't do it!

635
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,680
They're so distracted, they can't see you.

636
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,300
They don't know.

637
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,920
There's no way they'll know.

638
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,080
There's no way.

639
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,240
They won't push.

640
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,700
Oh my god, there's a shield right behind you.

641
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,620
Oh my god, the shield!

642
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,820
No fucking way!

643
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,980
No fucking way!

644
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,700
You get a free shield!

645
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,820
That's crazy!

646
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,320
Free shield, free shield, free shield!

647
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,000
You get a free shield!

648
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,280
Let's fucking go!

649
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,600
They're peeking!

650
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:20,540
It would be so fucked up if the shield just took that wall away.

651
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,700
He just takes that wall away after that.

652
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,780
Can she do that?

653
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,860
She can, yeah.

654
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,060
Oh my god!

655
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,800
I hope they got...

656
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,740
I hope she's down or something.

657
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,480
Or she doesn't notice, I hope.

658
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,400
She doesn't notice it's like her own wall.

659
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,560
Oh, nice, nice!

660
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:44,940
Cracked!

661
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,980
Oh my god.

662
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,320
That was insane!

663
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,740
Oh wait, I think you might...

664
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,020
I think she noticed!

665
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,260
Oh god, oh god!

666
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,200
She might know it's her wall.

667
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,160
Wait, they're getting pushed.

668
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,520
There's a Gibraltar right above them.

669
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,060
Nice, nice, nice, nice!

670
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,880
Oh no, they got the full kill though.

671
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:11,740
You're right.

672
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,060
You got both angels on your shoulders.

673
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,980
I think you can do this.

674
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,940
See guys, this is the difference between a pro player and us.

675
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,300
Us regular folk.

676
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,500
Oh, just top two.

677
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,320
You can do this.

678
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,980
Get that top two.

679
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,000
No.

680
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,860
Oh my god, oh shit!

681
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,620
We're not pushing him?

682
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:42,880
Oh no.

683
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,920
We know you exist now.

684
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,960
Oh no!

685
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,520
They knew your existence!

686
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,040
I haven't done anything.

687
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,000
Look at my awesomeness!

688
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,820
You gotta be fucking kidding me!

689
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,980
Oh my god!

690
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,100
I can't believe it!

691
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,820
I would like to give a special shout out to my boy Gerard.

692
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,740
For hyping you up!

693
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,940
It's a shout out!

694
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,820
No need, no need!

695
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,640
I don't need that fucking shout out after a terrible performance!

696
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,040
No way!

697
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,760
Oh my god!

698
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,040
Congratulations to the team that won!

699
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,180
Holy crap!

700
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,920
That wasn't my main!

701
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,080
That wasn't my main.

702
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:37,500
I could have done a better job if that was my main or something.

703
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,920
This was stage.

704
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,180
Warm up.

705
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,580
That's crazy.

706
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,440
It's not crazy!

707
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,560
It isn't!

708
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,680
I'm just warming up you see!

709
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,060
Yeah, I believe you Gerard.

710
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,600
Warm up, warm up!

711
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,580
His stress level is like at...

712
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,620
Okay, what's more stressful?

713
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,600
This or anal GS?

714
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,100
All of them!

715
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,760
Every single time that I'm here it's just fucking stressful!

716
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,480
Yeah, yeah.

717
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,460
No, flame, flame.

718
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,920
What's more stressful, flame?

719
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,920
What's more...

720
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,480
What's more stressful right now?

721
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,560
Unfortunately, in LGS at least I have teammates.

722
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,180
Oh damn!

723
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,180
Oh!

724
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,740
Oh!

725
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:26,480
Oh!

726
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,280
We got you covered though!

727
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:33,620
You wouldn't have made top 3 without our moral support.

728
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,640
Oh my god!

729
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,380
Just a little bit harder, but you know.

730
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,880
I did my job though, flame.

731
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,360
Didn't I do my job?

732
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,660
Hey, I shielded everybody in the first one!

733
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,720
Okay, I shielded everybody.

734
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,080
I healed somewhat.

735
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,380
Yeah, I was there.

736
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,900
You did great, sweetie.

737
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,060
Shut the fuck up!

738
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,100
Don't say that to me!

739
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,120
Okay, I actually need help on this one.

740
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,780
So apparently, my stream delay isn't working.

741
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,860
So how do you do that?

742
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,180
Okay, you gotta stop stream.

743
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,120
Stop stream.

744
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,900
And then...

745
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,700
Go to advanced.

746
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,640
And then put 180 seconds for your stream delay.

747
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,980
In OBS settings?

748
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

749
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:28,620
And then they have to wait 3 minutes until the go live button comes up on YouTube.

750
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,320
Okay, okay, okay.

751
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,120
Is it on stream?

752
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,960
Yeah, it's on advanced.

753
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,200
It's on advanced settings.

754
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,160
So you go to settings, and you go to advanced.

755
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:39,980
Uh-huh, okay.

756
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,960
Advanced, and which recording, stream delay...

757
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,900
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

758
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:48,320
And it's like 180 seconds.

759
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:48,840
Yeah.

760
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:50,840
Okay, 180.

761
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,040
Guys, there's no...

762
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,620
There's no way we can be last place with that now.

763
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,380
There's no way.

764
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,100
We have enough points to like...

765
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:02,280
To not be 20th place now.

766
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,080
To not be 20th place.

767
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,940
That is correct.

768
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:10,960
We did it.

769
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,900
Okay, so I'm restarting my stream.

770
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,400
Yeah, and then you have to wait.

771
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,660
You have to wait until the button goes live because it's literally doing a 3 minute stuff.

772
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,760
So as soon as 3 minutes pass, you can go live.

773
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,400
Okay, alright.

774
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:23,920
There you go.

775
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,240
Now you learn how to do stream delay.

776
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,820
I don't know when you'll ever use that again.

777
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,980
No, I will never use that again.

778
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,240
Now you know.

779
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,240
Wait, you're not trying to be an ALGS pro?

780
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,480
Yeah, you don't want to be an ALGS pro after that?

781
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,720
Aren't you inspired after Flame's performance?

782
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,860
Don't you want to get better at Apex after that?

783
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,260
No, I think I want to focus more on Marvels because that's my shit right now.

784
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,900
Wait, Flame, have you played Marvel Rivals yet?

785
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,620
No, I haven't played that much.

786
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,240
Wait, you haven't played that much?

787
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,900
No, I played like a few games.

788
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,420
Maybe 5 games or so.

789
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,580
Oh, so you haven't got addicted yet.

790
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,360
The moment you touch rank, it's over for you.

791
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,040
It's so over.

792
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,520
When I did Quickplay, I was like, this isn't that competitive.

793
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,720
I'm alright.

794
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,460
But then the moment I touch rank, it hooks you.

795
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,580
I think it's just the same, right?

796
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:25,860
It's just the addiction kicks in because you get more competitive and then you just like to see your numbers go up too.

797
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,800
Where are your mains?

798
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,260
I'm just supporting main.

799
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:35,520
I mostly do Luna, Mantis, Cloak, and Raccoon.

800
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,300
Luna!

801
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,920
Luna's my fucking favorite.

802
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,120
She fucking dances and becomes immortal for like 3 minutes or something.

803
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,720
They ban Luna now.

804
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:50,020
So when you get to Diamond, they start banning your characters because Luna's too powerful because everybody lives forever.

805
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,560
They just ban Luna now in the beginning.

806
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,680
So you can't even play Luna.

807
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,960
So there's like character banning?

808
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,500
Yeah, there's hero bans like League.

809
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,020
Oh god.

810
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:06,440
Because I was like Luna one trick and then I got to Diamond and they start banning Luna so I actually had to learn other characters.

811
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,540
I had to learn other characters in fucking Diamond.

812
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,460
I'm really envious of you.

813
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,740
You're able to play Marvels, man.

814
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,460
I'm so fucking busy with everything.

815
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,080
I can't even.

816
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,600
We finally had perm for that but I still can't play it.

817
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,380
At least he didn't watch other people and live vicariously through us.

818
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,500
Soon, soon I'll be able to play it.

819
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,000
Maybe, I hope.

820
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,780
Okay, I hope that was enough 3 minutes.

821
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,820
I hope so too.

822
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,220
Alright, we're fine.

823
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:46,940
We're totally fine.

824
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,860
We can do this again.

825
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:53,120
You know, not totally doing spiders was such good bait.

826
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:54,520
Unintentionally.

827
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,860
We didn't get a kill.

828
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,820
It was so smart.

829
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,000
But we got kills from it.

830
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,120
It was such a good unintentional bait.

831
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,280
Yeah.

832
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,380
Did great.

833
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,600
I'll loot this side then.

834
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,460
I'll loot the back.

835
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,980
One of you guys need to hit the blue bin.

836
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,180
Yeah, I can hit it.

837
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,440
Go wherever you're at.

838
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:19,660
Yoink.

839
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,740
I can hit it for us.

840
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,680
Don't worry.

841
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,980
Cause I don't think Gerard knows what the fuck the blue bin is.

842
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,840
Of course I don't.

843
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,700
It's kind of silly that you still assume I know stuff.

844
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,380
Exactly.

845
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,900
That's why I said I'd do it because I know you don't.

846
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

847
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:38,940
You do it.

848
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,400
You do it.

849
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:49,440
For those who don't know, also like Huge shout out to Gerard for you know coming clutch because he literally got in like today.

850
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,520
He's a bronze rank.

851
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,220
I think he's the lowest rank in this lobby.

852
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,100
Yes, I am.

853
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,620
Dude, I'm not even bronze.

854
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,240
I think I'm just rookie level.

855
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,360
I don't think I'm like qualified at all for this type of thing.

856
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,180
Anything to help.

857
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,840
No, I believe in you.

858
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,980
I believe as well.

859
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:12,820
I'm like support so I don't need to run batteries.

860
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,100
I can just use shield cells.

861
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,860
Yeah, but you still want to pick up batteries so you can give them to me.

862
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,180
Yeah, that's true.

863
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,780
Gerard can pick up batteries so he can give it to you.

864
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,700
Not me.

865
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,080
He's the...

866
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,660
True, true, true.

867
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,020
Doki, can you grab the cash over at the right there?

868
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,240
Yeah, I can.

869
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,580
I got a flatline here if you guys want.

870
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,480
I'm okay.

871
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,480
I'm going to run the 30-30 instead of the...

872
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,440
30-30 is still good.

873
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,680
30-30 is good.

874
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,400
I thought you were talking about the triple take.

875
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:47,980
I'm not going to lie.

876
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:52,240
If I could find a triple take but I haven't found one.

877
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,780
Triple take is actually like...

878
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,720
The best gun so far.

879
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,840
I don't think I've seen one.

880
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,960
I've only seen...

881
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,540
We want to leave now.

882
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,340
Alright, I'm handing over to you.

883
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,900
I'm going to evac us.

884
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:11,680
Okay.

885
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,640
Alright, Gerard, come here.

886
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,780
Come on, Gerard.

887
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,360
I'm coming, I'm coming.

888
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,380
How is it that I don't have anything?

889
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,140
I don't have any...

890
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:27,140
We want to just be at this house here, I think.

891
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,540
Just follow us, Gerard.

892
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,440
Just follow us.

893
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,240
Don't get triple take.

894
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,780
We have to go house.

895
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,180
Just don't get triple take.

896
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,160
Just go inside here.

897
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,520
We can shoot this guy on the zip.

898
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,980
No, I don't think I can make it in time.

899
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,720
That guy is crazy.

900
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,440
Gerard, can you...

901
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,560
Don't be in open.

902
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,520
It's not bad here.

903
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,380
Can you throw a health drone on me, Gerard?

904
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:53,920
Yeah.

905
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,060
Press Q.

906
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,920
Gerard, give him health drone.

907
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,740
Gerard, you got this.

908
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,340
I'm trying, I'm trying.

909
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,260
There we go, there we go.

910
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,420
Yeah, I can.

911
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,120
There we go, there we go.

912
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,540
There we go.

913
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:09,940
It's fine.

914
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,360
See, he's learning.

915
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,400
I'm learning, I'm learning, I'm learning.

916
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,360
Big steps, Gerard, big steps.

917
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,240
Yeah, big steps, big steps.

918
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,020
Are you seeing a sniper stalk?

919
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:22,440
Let me know.

920
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,020
Yep.

921
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,800
There's a triple take here.

922
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:28,720
Oh, nice.

923
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,480
I'll take that, actually.

924
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,420
I actually got purple heavy mags.

925
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,660
I don't know if...

926
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,620
Okay, I have a...

927
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,720
There's more energy ammo.

928
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,080
You have to be really careful from behind you.

929
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:38,980
They look down at us.

930
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:39,780
I know.

931
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,360
I have a purple heavy mag.

932
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,480
Oh, Gerard, you can stay inside.

933
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,140
Stay inside, Gerard.

934
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,400
You want to stay inside and just look around?

935
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just stay inside.

936
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,720
I'm worried for you, so...

937
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,900
Okay, alright, okay, fine.

938
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,680
I'm like setting up my stream.

939
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,800
That's why I'm a little bit quiet.

940
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,520
Okay, there we go.

941
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,240
Yeah, just stay inside.

942
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,300
Just stay inside, don't go out.

943
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,640
I'm inside, don't worry.

944
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,740
I'm a good boy.

945
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,460
I'm staying inside.

946
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,760
There we go, there we go.

947
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,360
Are you seeing more energy ammo?

948
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:13,820
Let me know.

949
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,540
I only have 72.

950
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,060
I have 64 here.

951
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,000
54, 54.

952
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:19,920
Someone need that?

953
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,880
No, I'm fine.

954
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,280
I need any of these.

955
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,840
Any attachments for a triple take?

956
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:27,900
Yeah.

957
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,500
I have lots of them.

958
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,620
Listen, Gerard.

959
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,520
Try and keep an eye out on just east here.

960
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,800
So there's like spiders.

961
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,740
Yeah, like right there.

962
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:39,540
That team.

963
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,700
Just look out for it.

964
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,480
Yeah, I'm looking.

965
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:44,820
Just look here.

966
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,680
Alright, just shoot.

967
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,480
They're flying south.

968
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,420
I think they might be going for the building next to us.

969
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:53,840
Yeah, they are.

970
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,240
I'm looking.

971
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:55,740
Okay, I'm looking.

972
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,740
I'm doing my job.

973
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,420
This team, we don't like...

974
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,920
We kind of want to make sure they don't push us.

975
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,380
Uh oh, enemy here.

976
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,300
I think I see someone here.

977
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,260
Okay, nice.

978
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:04,580
Good call.

979
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,220
Oh, wait.

980
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,740
I don't have a scope, so I can't see anything.

981
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,440
There's a 3x scope here that I can bring for you.

982
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,060
Give me a little bit.

983
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,080
Are you okay with a 3x?

984
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,760
Dry, are you fine with a 3x or no?

985
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,440
3x, uh, sure.

986
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,860
Alright, um...

987
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,500
I'm looking for you.

988
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,280
Yeah, so you can use to look.

989
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,960
They're rotating, they're rotating.

990
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,020
They're rotating now.

991
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,560
They're rotating this building.

992
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,700
Yeah, they're rotating to the bottom.

993
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,720
They might fight.

994
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,840
I don't see them going inside, but they went this way.

995
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,440
Yeah, I saw.

996
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,780
No, they're not fighting.

997
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,140
I think we're just chilling.

998
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,300
We'll just get a bunch of ammo.

999
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,060
Oh, yeah, they're inside.

1000
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,020
That's fine.

1001
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,800
They're fighting here at the north.

1002
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,780
Okay, I'm looking behind us just in case.

1003
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,360
I need a heal.

1004
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:01,920
Full heal.

1005
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,860
Let me know if you need me to help poke.

1006
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,160
Because I'm looking at the team in front.

1007
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,420
I think try and look with me here, Doki.

1008
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,800
Have Gerard look at the angle.

1009
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,000
Look behind, look behind.

1010
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:15,780
Look at this area.

1011
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:16,600
Okay.

1012
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,060
Oh wow, they're shooting over.

1013
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,640
Which angle do you want me to look at?

1014
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,300
Enemies here, enemies.

1015
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,300
Let us know if they're pushing.

1016
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,160
I don't have an angle here.

1017
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,840
They're up top here.

1018
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,360
I see them.

1019
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,620
They're getting pushed back, yeah.

1020
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,380
Yeah.

1021
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,460
I'll look back with Gerard.

1022
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,680
Alright, they're not pushing us, right?

1023
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,260
Oh, they took away our door.

1024
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,460
I think that has a Rampart.

1025
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,220
Yeah, they do.

1026
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:46,980
Oh, someone's shooting.

1027
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,900
They're pushing up a little bit.

1028
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:51,440
Oh wait, no, no.

1029
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,750
What characters do they have?

1030
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:06,550
They have Rampart, Valkyrie, and I think Gibby.

1031
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:08,010
I'm not sure.

1032
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:10,170
I'm not sure if they have Gibby, but...

1033
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:11,690
I'm gonna purposefully...

1034
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:12,730
I'm just watching the door.

1035
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,470
You need to arrest me, like, right away.

1036
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,630
You want to arrest me, like, right here in the middle.

1037
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:19,310
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1038
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:21,370
Close,

1039
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:24,810
close, close!

1040
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,290
On us, I think.

1041
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:27,890
Yeah, on us!

1042
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:30,190
Place ult, place ult!

1043
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:30,950
Just hold up top.

1044
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:32,710
Throw a castle wall down.

1045
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:33,410
I couldn't.

1046
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:34,190
They pushed me.

1047
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,530
Oh my god, why did they push us?

1048
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:41,110
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1049
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:43,610
Is that a different team?

1050
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,430
Oh my god!

1051
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,410
I did 14!

1052
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,110
I did 14!

1053
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:47,930
That's so great!

1054
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,570
Big, Jirard, big.

1055
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,130
That's an improvement.

1056
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:52,730
That is an...

1057
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,730
They died for that!

1058
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,450
I did so great!

1059
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,750
Jirard, that's an improvement, Jirard.

1060
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:04,710
We're going up!

1061
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,130
We're going up there!

1062
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:06,810
Going up!

1063
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:07,670
Eventually!

1064
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:12,810
Oh god, we got sandwiched hard!

1065
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,030
No, yeah, no.

1066
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,610
I don't know why they pushed that.

1067
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,430
That's like, such a weird push.

1068
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,210
Oh man.

1069
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:23,470
They went so fast, I couldn't put down my ult.

1070
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:26,990
The best I could do was just put my Q down.

1071
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,350
Yeah, that's rough.

1072
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:32,290
I think the team, oh my god, they've just been 1v3'd.

1073
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:33,990
Yeah, what the fuck?

1074
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,190
They just pushed us, just carred in.

1075
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,730
They just boosted into our house.

1076
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:39,570
They just all in'd it.

1077
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,710
Oh my god, they all in'd that shit.

1078
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:42,470
That's crazy.

1079
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:43,810
Damn.

1080
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,030
I think it's out of lifeline.

1081
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:49,590
I think that's...

1082
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:53,370
Yeah, you just put down the walls, and then that's...

1083
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:55,010
Yeah, I think we have walls blocking the door.

1084
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,150
I need some actual strats here.

1085
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:58,630
I need some actual strats.

1086
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:01,010
In order to improve my survivability.

1087
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:03,550
So all I have to do is stay with all of you, right?

1088
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:04,770
Yeah, yeah.

1089
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,310
So we're gonna put you on Rampart.

1090
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,530
Have you ever played Rampart before?

1091
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:09,810
Yes, I have.

1092
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:15,910
All we want you to do is just put walls down at a door, and then just survive.

1093
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:18,270
Okay, alright, good enough.

1094
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,610
At least I have some sort of experience.

1095
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:22,430
Also, how many walls does Rampart have?

1096
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:23,310
Because I don't remember.

1097
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:24,370
Three.

1098
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:31,490
She can have three just on her, but she can place down five.

1099
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:34,870
Okay, so...

1100
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:38,570
So you just make sure you can place five...

1101
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:41,770
You just tell him where to place his walls, and he should be fine.

1102
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:44,430
Okay, okay, alright.

1103
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:45,890
I believe in you.

1104
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:48,170
Yeah, okay, alright.

1105
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:51,030
You still believe in me after everything that happened?

1106
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:52,810
Look, that wasn't on you.

1107
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,550
That was just... we just got pushed.

1108
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:57,410
That was literally not on you.

1109
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:59,670
We could not do anything about that.

1110
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,050
Okay, alright, alright.

1111
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:02,010
I've been apologizing.

1112
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,590
This is the last time I'll apologize.

1113
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:04,550
Last time.

1114
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:06,710
Flame was like getting shot.

1115
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:09,190
Wait, what even was your strat there?

1116
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:10,430
Like...

1117
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:16,270
So if you get res'd, everyone gets a hundred evo points.

1118
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:28,330
So the strat usually in comp is to just get knocked with your armor off, and then have your new cast flame to res, and then you can pick up your armor, and you heal like full health, you know?

1119
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:34,150
Yeah, so we were trying to do that strat, and then we got pushed because you were already low.

1120
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,910
That's so unlucky.

1121
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,150
If only I knew.

1122
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:40,330
If only I knew that.

1123
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:41,730
My god.

1124
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:44,530
What would you have done, Gerard?

1125
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:46,250
I'm the one that has to res it.

1126
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:49,390
You just have to watch.

1127
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:53,390
What would that information be for you?

1128
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:55,270
I don't know.

1129
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:55,790
I don't know.

1130
00:41:56,630 --> 00:42:00,530
I guess you could have watched the door while we were trying to do this.

1131
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:01,250
Just watch the door.

1132
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:07,450
Yeah, if we do that again, you just watch your surroundings to make sure no team does that to us again.

1133
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,090
Okay, alright.

1134
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,330
Got it, got it, got it.

1135
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,590
That's fine, that's fine.

1136
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:20,790
I'm sort of getting like the rampart gameplay here, because the majority of the players that we've been up against are like just using her shields.

1137
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:21,670
Yeah, okay.

1138
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:24,430
Gerard, are you spectating their rampart right now?

1139
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,730
Uh, no, I'm Gibby.

1140
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,810
Okay, so you should spectate their rampart.

1141
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:30,550
Okay, learning, learning.

1142
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:32,270
Just doing my homework now.

1143
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:34,190
Five armor swaps.

1144
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,790
Okay, alright, alright.

1145
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:37,570
Just learn what she's doing.

1146
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:38,990
Analyze her.

1147
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,590
Do a VOD review right now.

1148
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:43,410
We're literally VOD reviewing right now.

1149
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:44,790
But not your VOD.

1150
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:47,030
We're VOD reviewing this random rampart.

1151
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:48,390
Oh my...

1152
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:49,170
During the tournament?

1153
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,030
I could've...

1154
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:52,270
I should've done this before the tournament.

1155
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,350
Or did a warmup or something.

1156
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:55,690
Wait, it's okay.

1157
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,670
I played one game of Marble Rivals before the tournament.

1158
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:00,950
I'm so locked in.

1159
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:11,690
Also, maybe Flame, for you, don't play Marble Rivals, because like I actually got a couple of pro players addicted to Marble Rivals.

1160
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:14,930
Is it nocturnal?

1161
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:16,230
No, it's effect.

1162
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:18,350
Oh, no.

1163
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:21,430
What have you done?

1164
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:25,310
I was like, hey, have you ever played Marble Rivals before?

1165
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:27,550
And then I made him download the game.

1166
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:35,130
And then he messaged me today and he's like, Doki, it's bad, I'm addicted.

1167
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,070
The game is good!

1168
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:42,650
It's not my fault if Elias doesn't do well.

1169
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:43,950
It's not my fault.

1170
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:47,590
I just wanted people to play Marble Rivals with me.

1171
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:49,830
Alliance is number one off.

1172
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:52,510
I appreciate you, Doki, taking out the competition.

1173
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:59,050
I might have to give you a cut of our prize pool.

1174
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:02,830
Griefing Alliance.

1175
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:07,090
Unintentionally Griefing Alliance.

1176
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:09,890
Unintentionally.

1177
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:10,930
Details, details.

1178
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:12,710
Flame, flame, flame.

1179
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:14,310
Have you ever played Marble Rivals?

1180
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,690
I've played a few games.

1181
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:19,090
But he hasn't got to rank yet, so he's not there.

1182
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:21,090
He's not there.

1183
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:22,350
Because that's what happened to Effect.

1184
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:26,270
I made him play Quick Blit and he's like, oh, it's pretty fun.

1185
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:29,690
And now he got to the rank part and now it's over for him.

1186
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:40,850
So for the sake of your career, you should not get into Marble Rivals.

1187
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:43,910
I mean, there is competitions based on marbles, right?

1188
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:45,950
I mean, there is like a tournament, so maybe.

1189
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:48,950
My teammate is literally playing in a Marble Rivals tournament.

1190
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:50,370
Oh, wait, who?

1191
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,390
Which teammate?

1192
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:55,510
He's been scrimming with a team in there.

1193
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,470
They already have a full stack.

1194
00:44:58,630 --> 00:44:59,290
Oh, Player K.

1195
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:03,250
I heard there's like a lot of tournaments going on right now for Marble Rivals.

1196
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:05,590
I mean, it's literally an Overwatch tournament, so.

1197
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,650
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.

1198
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:08,790
That's right.

1199
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:14,890
The game is made by NetEase, so you know they have a lot of money to throw into Marble Rivals, right?

1200
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:16,010
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1201
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:19,410
They have a lot of money to throw into it.

1202
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:23,050
Alright, are you watching the ramp part?

1203
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:24,610
Yeah, I am.

1204
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:26,430
I'm literally watching it right now.

1205
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:29,050
Build that wall and you just shoot.

1206
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:31,050
Just shoot through.

1207
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:35,230
If you had that wall, you could do times two of that damage.

1208
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:38,390
So instead of fourteen, you would have done twenty-eight.

1209
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:44,310
If I was just behind a wall, I would have done twenty-eight damage.

1210
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:44,670
Great.

1211
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:47,330
That's literally times two.

1212
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:49,890
Okay, I'm going to double.

1213
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:50,830
Next goal?

1214
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:52,230
I don't know how far we're going to go.

1215
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:53,690
Double that and give it to the next person.

1216
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:56,610
Literally, for real.

1217
00:45:58,170 --> 00:45:58,790
Oh, shit!

1218
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:01,590
Oh, my God!

1219
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:04,270
Oh, my God!

1220
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:05,310
He's cooking!

1221
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:09,430
Gerard, you could totally do that, too.

1222
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:12,930
Next time, next time.

1223
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:13,510
I'll definitely.

1224
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:15,190
Can you still give turrets to other people?

1225
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:16,670
Or is it locked again?

1226
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:19,170
Okay, Gerard, you put your turret on the ground.

1227
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:23,910
Okay, Gerard, when you get your ult, put your ult on the ground and then me and Flame will do that.

1228
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,430
I mean, as long as people can use it, then sure.

1229
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:31,390
Yeah, yeah, we can use it.

1230
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:32,010
Easy enough.

1231
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:34,670
I hope this team dies before they get top ten.

1232
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:35,690
It'll be so funny.

1233
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:39,850
Dude, I never usually think about team compositions mostly.

1234
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:42,830
I just, like, choose whatever, what character I want.

1235
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:45,250
Yeah, yeah, but now it's the big league.

1236
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:47,590
It's the big leagues now.

1237
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:51,870
I can't believe these are the type of things that you're, like, supposed to be prepared for, man.

1238
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:52,930
Oh, no.

1239
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:54,630
I've never been into a tournament.

1240
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:56,650
This is, like, my actual legit tournament.

1241
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:59,930
Because in the customs, we were just fucking around.

1242
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:01,910
This is a legit experience.

1243
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:03,450
You're learning so much now.

1244
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:06,010
You're learning the other side of gaming.

1245
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:08,750
Watching Flame, like, holy crap.

1246
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:09,690
Oh, yeah, I know.

1247
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:10,230
That was crazy.

1248
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:11,290
Maybe, just maybe.

1249
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:12,610
I'll give it a dabble.

1250
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:17,150
But not gonna lie, after the customs, I did kind of have a craving again for Apex.

1251
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:18,510
Just a little bit.

1252
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:21,530
Yeah, because it was just so fun.

1253
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:21,830
Yeah.

1254
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:22,770
It was just so fun.

1255
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:28,350
That's why I joined Apex through a tournament style in customs.

1256
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:34,350
I know, like, for a lot of pro players, rank has just been really boring lately.

1257
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:35,630
Oh, yeah.

1258
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:36,170
Oh, is it?

1259
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:37,290
You gonna say that again?

1260
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:39,730
Yeah, like, because it's just Yeah, what happens?

1261
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:41,970
Does it get boring after hundreds of hours?

1262
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,410
Because it's not competitive enough.

1263
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:44,970
Or there's, like, hackers.

1264
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:47,830
So there's not Oh, yeah, you're right.

1265
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:48,210
You're right.

1266
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:53,690
Because, like, if you queue into a pred lobby, you don't get mostly pros.

1267
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:56,510
You get, like, diamonds and plats.

1268
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:59,430
So, like, it's just mowing lobbies down.

1269
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:00,470
Oh.

1270
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:03,470
You don't actually it's not really competitive, competitive.

1271
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:07,130
From my perspective, I think it's way too competitive.

1272
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:10,450
Like, for me, because it's already too aggressive.

1273
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:12,430
You're a little baby.

1274
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:15,510
You're a little baby.

1275
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:16,810
You just have to keep on fighting.

1276
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:19,470
You're literally learning the game as we go.

1277
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:22,450
Guys, I think we can get top 10, guys.

1278
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:27,730
If we get another top 5, that has to give us top 10, right?

1279
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:33,710
Yeah, so then, if we get top 10, we don't have to wait, no.

1280
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:35,930
It probably won't.

1281
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:38,030
Top 10 is gonna be around like 30 points.

1282
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:41,550
And I think we got we got, like, 12 points.

1283
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:42,130
We got 12?

1284
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:45,670
So we just need another we just need another 18 points.

1285
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:46,570
Yeah, yeah.

1286
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:48,150
I believe in us.

1287
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:50,610
I believe in us.

1288
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:53,490
You're technically two people.

1289
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:56,610
So, like, we're a full team.

1290
00:48:56,910 --> 00:48:57,270
You're right.

1291
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:00,210
He's just made up of two people.

1292
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:03,090
But we're still a team of three, technically.

1293
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:11,550
If we add you, me, and Gerard, we're three people.

1294
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:18,370
You're gonna just take these insults, Gerard?

1295
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:18,990
Come on, man.

1296
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:20,350
Stand up for yourself.

1297
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:23,190
14 fucking damage, bro!

1298
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:28,410
Gerard, you did 14 more damage than you did last game.

1299
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:29,070
You know?

1300
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:30,110
Yeah!

1301
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:31,210
Stand up for yourself, bro!

1302
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:32,730
More damage than you did last game.

1303
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:33,890
Stand up for yourself, Gerard.

1304
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:35,090
Yeah, Gerard!

1305
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:36,370
Come on, Gerard!

1306
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,450
I can't do shit, man!

1307
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:39,330
Okay, okay.

1308
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:40,350
Next round.

1309
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:42,730
Okay, what should Gerard say?

1310
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:44,750
What should Gerard... like, you should coach him.

1311
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:46,150
What should he say back to me?

1312
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:49,310
He should say, Shut the fuck up, Doki.

1313
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:51,310
I'm better than you.

1314
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:54,010
Oh, so he should lie.

1315
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:56,890
He should lie.

1316
00:49:57,110 --> 00:49:58,210
I'm way better here.

1317
00:49:58,450 --> 00:49:58,930
I'm way better.

1318
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:00,550
Like, I'm hiding my true power, actually.

1319
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:01,110
Start the delusion.

1320
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:05,590
Actually, you're kind of right about that one.

1321
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:07,150
Delusion starts everything.

1322
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:09,050
Yeah, fake it till you make it, you know?

1323
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:11,690
Yeah, yeah, fake it till you make it.

1324
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:13,610
What the fuck is this?

1325
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:15,970
What the... Oh my god.

1326
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:18,550
That is a crazy push right there.

1327
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:19,710
Rampart, you can do this!

1328
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:20,470
Rampart!

1329
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:22,230
Oh, this Rampart's good, though.

1330
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:24,830
I know, just hopping in and...

1331
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:26,730
What is he doing?

1332
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:28,210
What is he doing?

1333
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:30,670
What have I just watched him do?

1334
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:32,150
Yo!

1335
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:36,330
I got the Rampart slowly clutching it.

1336
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:38,210
Oh my god!

1337
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:39,430
What?!

1338
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:42,090
What?!

1339
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:42,510
Bro!

1340
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:45,710
No fucking way!

1341
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:49,170
Bro, check his check his points!

1342
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:51,670
There's no way!

1343
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:54,050
That was crazy!

1344
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:55,450
That was...

1345
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:59,630
Dude, okay, no, they deserve that.

1346
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:02,070
I was rooting for that!

1347
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:04,650
That was a crazy play.

1348
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:06,770
Holy shit.

1349
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:09,090
Jared, that's what you're gonna do.

1350
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:11,830
That's what I was... That's what I'm gonna do!

1351
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:16,250
That's a lot of expectation onto the guy who just got here for like six hours ago.

1352
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:17,290
We literally bot reviewed it.

1353
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:18,570
You can do this.

1354
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:22,430
You can implement what we just saw and do it yourself.

1355
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:25,270
I'll try, I'll try.

1356
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:26,590
Thank you for believing, though.

1357
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:28,490
See, like what Flame said.

1358
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:29,890
It's all about the delusion.

1359
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:32,730
Okay.

1360
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:33,690
Alright.

1361
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:35,790
You gotta fake it till you make it.

1362
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:37,550
Okay, alright, alright.

1363
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:38,890
I gotta put in my ego here.

1364
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:40,750
I gotta pump myself up.

1365
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:42,050
You got this.

1366
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:43,010
I believe.

1367
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:43,750
I got this!

1368
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:44,810
I got this!

1369
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:47,730
I'm with two people who's actually way better than this!

1370
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:48,490
I got this.

1371
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:49,450
I'm reassured.

1372
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:50,310
I'm reassured.

1373
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:53,810
Okay, as long as you believe in me, both of you, I got this.

1374
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:55,290
I pumped up to the max.

1375
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:58,070
I believe in you, Gerard.

1376
00:51:58,150 --> 00:51:59,030
Yeah, keep on believing.

1377
00:51:59,310 --> 00:51:59,970
Keep on believing.

1378
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:03,070
I believe in you, too.

1379
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:04,290
I'm actually starting to see it.

1380
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:05,490
I'm actually starting to see the vision.

1381
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:06,410
You're starting to see it?

1382
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:07,470
You're starting to see the game plan?

1383
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:08,570
Yeah, I'm starting to see it.

1384
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:10,790
Do you remember what that rampart did?

1385
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:13,050
Okay, do you know how to do all of that, though?

1386
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,930
Like, do you know the buttons to do all of that?

1387
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:15,730
Yes, I do.

1388
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:17,410
E, throw the shield.

1389
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:20,710
Z is the ultimate where it's like a... the thingy.

1390
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:21,710
The machine gun.

1391
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:22,190
Yeah.

1392
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:22,750
Yeah, I know it.

1393
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:23,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1394
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:25,030
I knew you could do it.

1395
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:27,450
I knew you could do it.

1396
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:29,810
Yeah, I'm familiar with the controls, yes.

1397
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:31,050
I can do it.

1398
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:31,870
I can do it.

1399
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:39,050
It's just, uh, it's just a matter of, like, um, like a positioning because I think I suck the most at positioning.

1400
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:42,130
Like, I keep running around, like, where I'm not supposed to.

1401
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:44,550
Like, earlier in the round, I was just running in front of you.

1402
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:48,330
No, earlier... No, Gerard, you were going outside.

1403
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:50,690
No, positioning was...

1404
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:52,170
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!

1405
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:53,690
I'M RUNNING OUTSIDE!

1406
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:55,930
We were like, Gerard, we were like, stay inside, Gerard.

1407
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:57,330
And then you went out.

1408
00:52:57,470 --> 00:52:58,510
I was like...

1409
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:00,930
You can't blame me!

1410
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:02,030
What do you mean?

1411
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:06,430
We gave you one instruction that was to stay inside.

1412
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:07,830
And you went outside.

1413
00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:08,090
I'm panicking.

1414
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:09,150
I was panicking.

1415
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:09,910
I was panicking.

1416
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:10,490
Okay, panic.

1417
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:12,670
The panic, like, gets to ya.

1418
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:15,270
Uh, this is my first time.

1419
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:18,050
I appreciate... That's okay, you're learning.

1420
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:19,530
You're learning as we go along.

1421
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:23,870
Now you know, if we tell you to go inside, you stay inside.

1422
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:25,730
Stay inside, stay inside.

1423
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:28,890
Are we also gonna do the same situation for the next one?

1424
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:29,910
Stay inside?

1425
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:31,550
Well, it depends on...

1426
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:33,610
Just listen to what Flame says.

1427
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:35,110
We're in a house.

1428
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:38,130
Your job is to just put walls up.

1429
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:38,450
Great!

1430
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:40,290
Okay, keep my walls up.

1431
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:41,030
Okay, okay.

1432
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:44,710
If we're not outside, how do I position my fucking walls?

1433
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,990
Like, just randomly put them around us?

1434
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:48,650
Uh, yeah.

1435
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:55,670
I mean, you wanna think about it like, if we get pushed, um, where would we want to play, right?

1436
00:53:55,990 --> 00:54:03,450
Like, where's the angle that is most likely to be pushed, and then given that angle, you just gotta place walls around that.

1437
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:03,650
Yeah, game sense.

1438
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:05,150
You gotta lock in on that game sense.

1439
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:06,210
Yeah, exactly.

1440
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:06,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1441
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:10,250
You're basically getting game sense as we go.

1442
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:11,390
Like...

1443
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:13,310
Yeah, I'm not...

1444
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:19,350
Like, I mean, during the actual tournament, I mean, I could've at least practiced, but it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

1445
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:19,830
It's okay.

1446
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:21,670
We'll be fine.

1447
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:25,210
God gives his toughest soldiers the greatest battles.

1448
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:26,790
This is it.

1449
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:27,810
This is it.

1450
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:29,770
I got a calling from this one.

1451
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:33,510
Maybe I can actually be as great as you two.

1452
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:39,150
Unfortunately, I think the saying goes like, God's favorite soldier faces the toughest battles.

1453
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:41,050
Oh, okay, okay.

1454
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:44,850
Even I fumbled that one, but you know, you get the point.

1455
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:45,910
You get the point.

1456
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:47,610
You tried, that's all that matters.

1457
00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:48,710
I tried, yeah, yeah, see?

1458
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:50,570
Tried, I tried, I tried.

1459
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:52,170
I definitely got, um, actually.

1460
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:55,210
Um, actually.

1461
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,770
This stream is going off to a bad start.

1462
00:54:58,030 --> 00:54:58,710
What do you mean?

1463
00:54:58,770 --> 00:54:59,670
We got third!

1464
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:02,150
It went off a great start!

1465
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:05,150
That's the best start we could ever get.

1466
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:06,030
Third place?

1467
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:07,530
No, you're...

1468
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:10,610
I thought I could Don't get those in dreams.

1469
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:16,530
Okay, we're gonna get even higher after this.

1470
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:16,930
Higher.

1471
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:18,070
Yeah, that's true.

1472
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:19,230
Higher than third?

1473
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:21,150
Are you trying to say we're gonna get second?

1474
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:22,330
Yes.

1475
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:23,730
Oh my god.

1476
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:25,070
Oh my god.

1477
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:26,430
Rampart, um.

1478
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,770
Oh wait, wait, no.

1479
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:29,710
Rampart, rampart, rampart.

1480
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:30,410
Rampart, rampart, rampart.

1481
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:31,430
Right side, right side, right side.

1482
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:32,130
No!

1483
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:35,390
I forgot about, I don't have rampart!

1484
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:36,950
You don't have rampart!

1485
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:38,950
You don't have rampart!

1486
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:40,730
Wait, wait.

1487
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:42,930
I don't have rampart!

1488
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:44,750
Oh shit, that was my different account!

1489
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:45,570
Oh fuck!

1490
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:48,070
You don't have rampart?

1491
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:50,050
I forgot about that!

1492
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:51,850
Oh my god.

1493
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:54,960
Oh my god.

1494
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:59,770
Wait, do you have enough currency to buy a character?

1495
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:04,310
Do you have enough currency to buy a character?

1496
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:05,250
I'll loot the back.

1497
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:06,510
I'm looting the back.

1498
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:11,150
Now I have to unlearn everything that I just saw!

1499
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:12,230
It's fine!

1500
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:13,070
It's fine.

1501
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:15,570
Listen, listen, listen.

1502
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:17,150
We got third because of my skills.

1503
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:21,450
We got third because of this one.

1504
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:23,150
So have some more faith.

1505
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:26,470
We were on this map last game too!

1506
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:28,850
Yeah, you're right!

1507
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:31,090
Yeah, it's fine!

1508
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:31,790
It's fine!

1509
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:37,810
I like that we had all this long-ass talking and you never even had fucking...

1510
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:39,870
Out the window!

1511
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:44,270
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

1512
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:45,810
You still got me, right?

1513
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:47,250
You still believe in me, right buddy?

1514
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:48,130
He's literally choking.

1515
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:50,190
You still got me, right buddy?

1516
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:52,370
I won't lie to you, man.

1517
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:53,790
My confidence is wavering.

1518
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:55,610
My beliefs are shaking.

1519
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:58,390
I don't blame you!

1520
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:07,810
You spent 10 minutes watching the Rampart just to find out you never even had it unlocked.

1521
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:10,870
Well, I did have her in my other account.

1522
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:12,330
I just forgot about it.

1523
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:13,290
Whoops.

1524
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:15,310
Whoopsies.

1525
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:17,690
We can do this, we can do this.

1526
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:21,590
If you guys don't have faith in me, I have faith in all of you.

1527
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:22,810
That's alright.

1528
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:23,710
I believe.

1529
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:25,670
Keep on believing.

1530
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:31,710
We'll get this cash and then we're going to Yeah, I think I looted everything on my end.

1531
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:33,290
Did we loot the top here?

1532
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:33,950
I'm gonna check.

1533
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:38,130
Wait, we don't have a scanner though with this comp.

1534
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:40,070
That's the only bad thing.

1535
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:41,170
We have console.

1536
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:42,430
Oh, that's true.

1537
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:42,710
Okay.

1538
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:44,990
We just go echo.

1539
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:45,910
Yoink.

1540
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:46,510
Yoink.

1541
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:50,590
Okay, I got a bunch of heavy ammo if you guys want some.

1542
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:51,850
Cool.

1543
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:54,370
Thank you for providing us.

1544
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:56,190
I got it.

1545
00:57:56,190 --> 00:57:56,930
I got it.

1546
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:57,450
Just saying.

1547
00:57:57,650 --> 00:57:59,450
I'm just carrying everything I see.

1548
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:02,350
Is there an evac here?

1549
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:03,850
Yeah, I have an evac ready.

1550
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:08,430
Got it, got it, got it.

1551
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:10,110
Can you grab that cash?

1552
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:11,690
Oh, yeah, I can.

1553
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:12,450
I'll head over there.

1554
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:17,990
If you guys have any bags, anything, that would be helpful.

1555
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:20,150
I know there was one, but I can't.

1556
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:22,810
We gotta go now anyway, so we can't go back.

1557
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:27,550
I'm grabbing this cash.

1558
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:30,750
Yeah, just follow him and you should be fine.

1559
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:36,090
We want to be at Stormcatcher here by the time this ring closes.

1560
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:36,710
Oh, yeah.

1561
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:38,410
Oh, wait, I'm gonna try...

1562
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:39,130
Oh, from where?

1563
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:39,630
It's fine, fine.

1564
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:40,770
In front of me, in front of me.

1565
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:41,730
This way.

1566
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:43,510
Coming to us, coming to us.

1567
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:45,730
I think it's grabbing cash.

1568
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:46,290
They're grabbing cash.

1569
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:46,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1570
00:58:47,810 --> 00:58:48,650
I'm coming back.

1571
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:52,090
I don't know if they're... Look at them, look at them.

1572
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:53,230
Bubbles fading.

1573
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:54,210
Oh, they're gone, they're gone.

1574
00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:55,610
Yeah, they're fucking gone, gone.

1575
00:58:57,770 --> 00:59:00,230
I just popped my Q when we lived.

1576
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:01,090
Alright, where do we go?

1577
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:02,470
Just go Echo.

1578
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:09,110
Do you have enough currency to buy Rampart?

1579
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:09,490
Yes.

1580
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:12,250
I saw shots in front of us.

1581
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:14,290
I think they're shooting at...

1582
00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:15,650
I don't know what they're shooting at though.

1583
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:17,730
Can I buy inside the lobby room?

1584
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:18,810
The private lobby?

1585
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:19,350
Can I buy?

1586
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:21,550
We'll just be like...

1587
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:23,710
We'll just be like...

1588
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:25,630
Sorry, he's restarting.

1589
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:27,910
You just have to leave for a little bit.

1590
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:29,550
Yeah, it's literally like 30 seconds.

1591
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:30,350
We should be fine.

1592
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:38,010
We need to hit the console.

1593
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:40,410
I can...

1594
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:40,910
give you a Q.

1595
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:44,010
I'm right in front of you.

1596
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:45,750
You should get close to us.

1597
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:46,670
You're just in his.

1598
00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:49,030
There might be a team.

1599
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:50,550
It's okay, we can find one here.

1600
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:52,110
There's a res here.

1601
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:52,730
There's a bag here.

1602
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:53,330
There's a bag here.

1603
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:56,570
Blue bag here.

1604
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:01,250
I'm gonna hit the console.

1605
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:02,570
You guys just stay here and look around.

1606
01:00:02,790 --> 01:00:03,530
I can just...

1607
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:06,810
Get that blue bag here.

1608
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:08,770
I should get the...

1609
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:09,650
helmet too.

1610
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:11,530
Yoink.

1611
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:14,090
There's a blue bag here in front of me.

1612
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:16,690
Okay, thank you.

1613
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:19,150
I'm looking in front.

1614
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:20,590
Oh, okay.

1615
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:21,970
Okay.

1616
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:23,810
What's the plan?

1617
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:25,950
I think the zone pulls around here.

1618
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:29,930
We wanna go back up here.

1619
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:32,170
Come on, Droid.

1620
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:32,990
Let's go.

1621
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:34,270
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

1622
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:35,570
We can make it.

1623
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:37,350
We can, we can.

1624
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:39,310
Okay.

1625
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:42,470
We're not last.

1626
01:00:42,690 --> 01:00:43,830
Some team is gonna die soon.

1627
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:47,610
We're not gonna be last.

1628
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:48,450
We're not gonna be last.

1629
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:49,390
They're not dying fully, but like...

1630
01:00:49,390 --> 01:00:51,530
two people got knocked.

1631
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:55,070
Nice, nice, nice.

1632
01:00:55,950 --> 01:00:57,350
This is a scary cross.

1633
01:00:57,550 --> 01:00:58,650
Flame not gonna lie.

1634
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:02,530
It's okay, just believe.

1635
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:03,630
I'm believing.

1636
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:06,510
Droid, you gotta believe too.

1637
01:01:06,890 --> 01:01:07,270
Believe!

1638
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:08,370
Everybody believe!

1639
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:12,930
If we get shot, we just send Droid to run forward and bait the shots for us.

1640
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:13,390
Yeah, exactly.

1641
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:16,930
I mean, I could actually...

1642
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:19,970
I'm looking back, I'm looking behind us.

1643
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:22,910
Yeah, just let me absorb all the bullets.

1644
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:25,110
Come hit this, but...

1645
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:26,370
I'll absorb all of them for you.

1646
01:01:26,370 --> 01:01:27,110
I think we're going left.

1647
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:29,370
Follow us.

1648
01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:33,010
Okay, yep, yep, yep, following.

1649
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:38,850
I wanna go here.

1650
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:40,770
I think there might be people there though.

1651
01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:41,950
Yeah, there is.

1652
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:43,030
Okay, go back.

1653
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:44,090
Alright, back here.

1654
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:47,190
We gotta teach you how to...

1655
01:01:49,650 --> 01:01:50,870
It's fine, it's fine.

1656
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:52,050
Teach me how to what?

1657
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:53,530
Teach you how to do it.

1658
01:01:55,030 --> 01:01:56,490
Can you heal my armor, Doki?

1659
01:01:56,890 --> 01:01:59,210
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

1660
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:03,190
You're fine, you're fine.

1661
01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:04,470
Yeah, okay.

1662
01:02:04,670 --> 01:02:06,070
Just rip another evac.

1663
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:07,970
We're landing right here in the corner.

1664
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:10,010
Just evac us anywhere, Doki.

1665
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:15,530
Alright, we're going on this...

1666
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:16,870
You see my yellow ping, where it's at?

1667
01:02:17,330 --> 01:02:17,490
Yep.

1668
01:02:19,290 --> 01:02:22,150
Okay, look up when you...

1669
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:22,910
Look up, look up.

1670
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:25,390
Just look up and then you do it.

1671
01:02:25,390 --> 01:02:26,430
Keep following me, keep following me.

1672
01:02:27,170 --> 01:02:28,990
Okay, and then after you get off...

1673
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:30,690
We're landing here in this corner on the left.

1674
01:02:32,110 --> 01:02:32,430
Be careful.

1675
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:34,510
Nice, good job.

1676
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:36,410
Just get our wall down, Slime.

1677
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:37,250
Anywhere.

1678
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:39,550
Oh my god.

1679
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:40,250
What?

1680
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:43,490
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

1681
01:02:44,410 --> 01:02:45,290
No, it's not fine.

1682
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:46,030
They're coming in.

1683
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:48,450
Oh, yo, yo, yo, yo.

1684
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:50,870
Oh my god.

1685
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:53,570
Where did this come from?

1686
01:02:53,810 --> 01:02:54,570
MP, MP.

1687
01:02:55,430 --> 01:02:56,830
They just pushed us from the house.

1688
01:02:57,010 --> 01:02:58,850
No, I got hit by two nades.

1689
01:02:58,930 --> 01:02:59,730
I couldn't do anything.

1690
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:01,410
Oh no.

1691
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:03,750
Oh, look at that.

1692
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:05,630
That was such a good nade.

1693
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:06,530
Holy sh...

1694
01:03:06,530 --> 01:03:08,530
I don't even think it's like...

1695
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:10,770
I don't even think that was the...

1696
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:11,250
Wait.

1697
01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:13,530
This is the original team that pushed us?

1698
01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:15,790
Uh, it should be.

1699
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:17,590
You got zero damage?

1700
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:19,070
See, I'm not that bad.

1701
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:22,170
I got naded.

1702
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:23,890
I couldn't even fucking register.

1703
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:25,770
Zero damage is zero damage.

1704
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:26,670
You gotta do better, man.

1705
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:27,270
Oh my god.

1706
01:03:28,190 --> 01:03:31,110
Okay, I'm not teaching you anymore, Jirai.

1707
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:35,210
Wait, how did you hit him, Flame?

1708
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:36,390
Come on, come on.

1709
01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:38,510
I just sat between my rampart covers.

1710
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:39,950
You just...

1711
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:42,170
He just sat between my rampart covers.

1712
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:43,330
I was just chilling.

1713
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:47,190
I was like, I landed and I landed into two nades.

1714
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:49,210
I was like, okay, I guess I die.

1715
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:52,590
Yeah, we got squished real hard.

1716
01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:53,730
They died for their efforts.

1717
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:55,750
What's wrong with you?

1718
01:03:57,870 --> 01:04:00,090
They literally died for it.

1719
01:04:00,890 --> 01:04:02,490
Wait, what place were we?

1720
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:03,710
We were not...

1721
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:07,650
We were not 20th, if you want to know.

1722
01:04:09,310 --> 01:04:13,450
I think we were like 17th or something.

1723
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:15,610
How does the points system work here?

1724
01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:19,950
It's placement and kills.

1725
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:21,410
So we didn't get either.

1726
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:25,110
We get zero points for that game.

1727
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:28,930
But we're off of Storm Point now.

1728
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:30,590
I'm good.

1729
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:31,930
I love World's Edge.

1730
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:34,250
I know how to play positioning for that.

1731
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:37,630
World's Edge is where I got prepped.

1732
01:04:37,890 --> 01:04:41,630
I'm very well versed in World's Edge.

1733
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:45,950
I'll just say yes to everything.

1734
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:50,270
Can I leave the lobby here?

1735
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:50,910
Yeah, you can.

1736
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:52,890
You can leave the lobby.

1737
01:04:53,310 --> 01:04:55,310
But there is a lifeline on this team.

1738
01:04:55,310 --> 01:04:56,410
If you want a VOD review.

1739
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:59,030
You're playing Rampart.

1740
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:00,290
You're playing Rampart.

1741
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:01,510
You'll be fine.

1742
01:05:01,950 --> 01:05:04,070
You don't need a VOD review.

1743
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:06,490
I'll do this later.

1744
01:05:06,550 --> 01:05:09,130
I'm just going to watch their gunfight or something.

1745
01:05:09,470 --> 01:05:10,910
Just to get me a little bit inspired.

1746
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:13,430
You can play some pubs while we watch this.

1747
01:05:15,550 --> 01:05:17,890
I think you'll get more damage in there.

1748
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:19,710
Than in these lobbies.

1749
01:05:21,410 --> 01:05:23,270
At least it'll keep me motivated.

1750
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:24,430
Yeah, it'll keep you motivated.

1751
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:25,750
You'll be like, you see that chat?

1752
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:27,690
That's what I'm going to do in the lobby.

1753
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:30,750
That's what I'm going to do.

1754
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:35,730
I mean, we did the exact same thing.

1755
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:36,550
By the way, in the customs.

1756
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:39,210
We just did a bunch of damage.

1757
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:41,130
In the pubs.

1758
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,410
And after joining that, we did literally nothing.

1759
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:45,150
I thought we had a chance.

1760
01:05:45,890 --> 01:05:47,290
It gave us hopium.

1761
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:48,630
Just for a little bit.

1762
01:05:49,010 --> 01:05:50,550
Look, I believe in you.

1763
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:52,830
You survived a very long time in hide and seek.

1764
01:05:54,810 --> 01:05:55,470
Right?

1765
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:57,570
I mean, you did.

1766
01:05:58,190 --> 01:06:00,130
Just specifically that one.

1767
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:08,170
Do we have extra points for the next one?

1768
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:10,610
What do we exactly need?

1769
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:11,710
For us to survive.

1770
01:06:11,970 --> 01:06:14,350
We need around 20 points.

1771
01:06:14,490 --> 01:06:15,890
We need 20 points.

1772
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:18,630
We need another top 5.

1773
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:21,550
We have 3 games to get a top 5.

1774
01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:24,670
That's not that hard.

1775
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:25,630
Go for it.

1776
01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:27,950
That's not that hard if you think about it.

1777
01:06:27,970 --> 01:06:30,670
It's not that hard to survive out of these fucking beasts.

1778
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:32,490
Beasts that are all over me.

1779
01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:34,890
If you think about it, it's not that hard.

1780
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:40,490
What ranks are we fighting against, actually?

1781
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:43,330
All of them diamond?

1782
01:06:44,370 --> 01:06:46,930
Technically, I should have got a...

1783
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:48,890
I needed a gold or below.

1784
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:50,830
And when they say a gold or below...

1785
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:52,950
I found a bronze player.

1786
01:06:56,570 --> 01:06:57,770
Great choice!

1787
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:02,590
You only found one of the worst.

1788
01:07:02,590 --> 01:07:08,830
You have no idea how hard it was to find anybody that's gold, silver, or...

1789
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:11,530
It wasn't a privilege being found out at all.

1790
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:13,130
I asked so many people.

1791
01:07:13,290 --> 01:07:14,810
And I even did an open call.

1792
01:07:14,810 --> 01:07:17,730
And then someone in my twitter replies was like...

1793
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:18,690
You should Asteroid.

1794
01:07:18,770 --> 01:07:19,630
And I was like, you know what?

1795
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:22,070
I may as well just Asteroid.

1796
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:25,790
I thought I was special.

1797
01:07:26,490 --> 01:07:29,370
You went to everyone else first.

1798
01:07:31,730 --> 01:07:34,070
You were the last.

1799
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:36,910
They were like, what's your rank?

1800
01:07:36,990 --> 01:07:38,770
And they were like, oh, I'm plat.

1801
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:39,830
Or like, diamond.

1802
01:07:40,070 --> 01:07:42,130
And I'm like, when were you plat?

1803
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:46,870
What was that season?

1804
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:48,050
Season 12?

1805
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:49,970
Fucked up so many ranks.

1806
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:54,190
I'm getting a little bit pissed here.

1807
01:07:54,330 --> 01:07:56,970
I'm gonna prove you wrong.

1808
01:07:57,230 --> 01:07:58,370
I'm gonna go ranked.

1809
01:07:58,770 --> 01:08:00,350
And I'm gonna get to your level.

1810
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:02,710
You're gonna go ranked and not be bronze?

1811
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:05,370
Then you won't be invited to anything, John.

1812
01:08:06,570 --> 01:08:10,270
If you're too high ranked, you won't be invited to anything.

1813
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:18,130
I WILL DESTROY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE ASSHOLES IN THIS RING.

1814
01:08:18,330 --> 01:08:19,390
AFTER I GET BETTER.

1815
01:08:19,550 --> 01:08:21,190
THAT IS A PROMISE.

1816
01:08:21,370 --> 01:08:23,130
I WILL KILL ONE.

1817
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:23,930
AT LEAST ONE.

1818
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:28,010
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TOURNAMENTS I'M GONNA BE IN, BUT I WILL BE ENTERING ALL OF THEM.

1819
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:31,990
JUST ASK YOUR SENPAIS.

1820
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:34,190
AND BE LIKE, CAN I GET A TOURNAMENT INVITE?

1821
01:08:34,590 --> 01:08:35,450
CAN I GET IN?

1822
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:36,350
CAN I GET IN?

1823
01:08:36,390 --> 01:08:36,830
COME ON.

1824
01:08:37,090 --> 01:08:38,270
THIS IS FOR A VENDETTA.

1825
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:40,250
I NEED TO PROVE TO THEM.

1826
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:41,510
THAT I AM NOT.

1827
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:42,350
FUCKING.

1828
01:08:43,050 --> 01:08:43,650
BRONZE.

1829
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:44,790
BUT YOU ARE.

1830
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:48,490
NO I'M NOT.

1831
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:50,070
NO I WON'T BE.

1832
01:08:50,490 --> 01:08:51,950
I WON'T BE.

1833
01:08:52,210 --> 01:08:53,190
I WON'T BE.

1834
01:08:53,370 --> 01:08:55,870
I WILL BE SOMETHING ABOVE.

1835
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:57,970
SOMETHING GREATER.

1836
01:08:58,630 --> 01:08:59,870
I BELIEVE IN YOU.

1837
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:01,350
I BELIEVE IN YOU TOO.

1838
01:09:02,170 --> 01:09:04,690
THIS WILL BE YOUR MOTIVATION ARC RIGHT THERE.

1839
01:09:05,730 --> 01:09:09,170
BUT IT WOULD BE EVEN MORE AWESOME IF A BRONZE PLAYER ACTUALLY TOOK SOMEONE DOWN HERE.

1840
01:09:09,170 --> 01:09:10,570
IT WOULD BE.

1841
01:09:10,590 --> 01:09:12,530
IT WOULD BE VERY AWESOME.

1842
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:14,050
THE GREATEST THING EVER.

1843
01:09:14,190 --> 01:09:16,950
I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE START OF MY JOURNEY.

1844
01:09:17,470 --> 01:09:18,130
IN APEX.

1845
01:09:19,050 --> 01:09:21,710
FLAME, DO YOU THINK HE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO IT?

1846
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:23,270
YOUR HONEST OPINION.

1847
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:25,250
I MEAN YOU HAD...

1848
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:26,490
YOU STARTED LIKE ME RIGHT?

1849
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:27,770
YOU STARTED LIKE ME RIGHT?

1850
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:29,530
WE ALL STARTED FROM ZERO.

1851
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:31,210
FLAME?

1852
01:09:32,350 --> 01:09:32,850
WHAT?

1853
01:09:34,430 --> 01:09:35,650
WERE YOU BORN WITH IT?

1854
01:09:35,650 --> 01:09:36,470
THE FUCK?

1855
01:09:36,810 --> 01:09:37,970
WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS?

1856
01:09:39,710 --> 01:09:40,790
MY FIRST...

1857
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:43,030
MY FIRST TIME PLAYING APEX.

1858
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:44,190
I GOT PRED.

1859
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:46,390
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

1860
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:48,350
WHAT THE FUCK?

1861
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:49,610
WHAT A FLEX.

1862
01:09:50,590 --> 01:09:52,570
WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST FPS GAME?

1863
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:54,310
WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST FPS GAME?

1864
01:09:54,450 --> 01:09:57,250
WERE YOU LIKE A FUCKING BABY WHEN YOU WERE PLAYING FPS GAMES?

1865
01:09:57,630 --> 01:09:58,210
THE FUCK?

1866
01:09:58,350 --> 01:09:59,830
YEAH, I STARTED OFF REALLY LATE.

1867
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:00,730
I PLAYED SPLATOON.

1868
01:10:00,730 --> 01:10:02,850
IT WASN'T AN FPS GAME.

1869
01:10:03,710 --> 01:10:05,230
YOU SUCKED AT FIRST, RIGHT?

1870
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:05,950
THAT'S GONNA BE ME.

1871
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:06,890
I'M GONNA BE...

1872
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:11,910
YOU'RE LYING.

1873
01:10:12,150 --> 01:10:13,990
YOU CANNOT POSSIBLY BE GOOD.

1874
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:14,810
NO, I DID.

1875
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:17,030
I GOT SPLATOON 1-3.

1876
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:20,090
OKAY.

1877
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:23,130
SUDDENLY MY CHANCES OF ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH THIS IS LOW.

1878
01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:25,990
I THINK YOU HAVE...

1879
01:10:25,990 --> 01:10:27,530
MAYBE I DON'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES.

1880
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:29,870
THERE'S LIKE TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF PEOPLE.

1881
01:10:30,150 --> 01:10:31,910
THE ONES THAT WERE BORN WITH IT.

1882
01:10:32,190 --> 01:10:35,650
AND THE ONES THAT TRY REALLY REALLY HARD.

1883
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:40,090
I'M GONNA BE TRYING REALLY REALLY HARD.

1884
01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:41,610
YEAH, I BELIEVE IN YOU.

1885
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:45,430
YOU GOT THIS.

1886
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:46,490
AS PEOPLE WHO...

1887
01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:50,550
I'M GONNA BE A MOTIVATOR FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE STARTING OFF THIS GAME.

1888
01:10:50,610 --> 01:10:51,610
YEAH, EXACTLY.

1889
01:10:52,110 --> 01:10:53,750
THE GAME WILL EXPLODE BECAUSE OF ME.

1890
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:57,130
YOU'LL BE AN INSPIRATION TO ALL THE BRONZE PLAYERS.

1891
01:10:57,130 --> 01:10:58,570
I'M DEFINITELY SAVING APEX LEGENDS.

1892
01:10:58,650 --> 01:11:00,430
YEAH, YOU'RE GONNA SAVE APEX LEGENDS.

1893
01:11:00,570 --> 01:11:02,570
BECAUSE THE BRONZE PLAYERS...

1894
01:11:02,570 --> 01:11:04,650
I'M JUST IMAGINING THESE PLAYERS ARE ME RIGHT NOW.

1895
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:07,930
NOT GONNA LIE, I'VE BEEN DREAMING ABOUT THIS.

1896
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:11,890
LIKE, WHEN I STARTED PLAYING APEX, I'VE BEEN DREAMING OF JUST SQUAD WIPING LEFT AND RIGHT.

1897
01:11:12,150 --> 01:11:13,490
SQUAD WIPING LEFT AND RIGHT.

1898
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:14,210
YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE.

1899
01:11:15,110 --> 01:11:16,370
IT WON'T BE A DREAM.

1900
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:17,230
IT WON'T BE.

1901
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:20,310
WE HAVE TWO DAYS TO DO THIS.

1902
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:21,570
SO LIKE, I BELIEVE.

1903
01:11:23,090 --> 01:11:23,490
BELIEVE.

1904
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:25,490
BELIEVE.

1905
01:11:25,830 --> 01:11:26,810
WE ARE THE DREAM TEAM.

1906
01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:28,650
YEAH, IT CAN'T BE THAT DIFFICULT.

1907
01:11:28,670 --> 01:11:30,290
WE MAKE THINGS INTO REALITY.

1908
01:11:30,410 --> 01:11:32,550
IT'S NO LONGER A DREAM, EVERYBODY.

1909
01:11:32,910 --> 01:11:34,370
IT'S FINE, I BELIEVE.

1910
01:11:34,510 --> 01:11:37,590
YOU'RE GONNA BE LIKE MARKIPLIER IF HE PLAYED APEX.

1911
01:11:39,010 --> 01:11:39,410
LAUGHING.

1912
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:40,510
LAUGHING.

1913
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:42,670
HE DOESN'T EVEN PLAY APEX.

1914
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:43,170
EXACTLY.

1915
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:45,850
YOU'RE GONNA BE MARKIPLIER IF HE PLAYED APEX.

1916
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:46,770
YEAH, I'M GONNA BE DIFFERENT.

1917
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:48,990
I'M NO LONGER GONNA BE COMPARED TO HIM.

1918
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:49,630
I'M GONNA BE DIFFERENT.

1919
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:51,310
THIS IS MY NEW JOURNEY.

1920
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:52,250
YOU'RE NEW JOURNEY.

1921
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:54,910
I AM SOMEBODY ELSE.

1922
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:55,790
I AM ME.

1923
01:11:56,850 --> 01:11:57,330
LAUGHING.

1924
01:11:57,590 --> 01:11:58,650
STOP IT.

1925
01:11:59,150 --> 01:11:59,630
LAUGHING.

1926
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:03,690
WHATEVER, WHATEVER, WHATEVER.

1927
01:12:03,970 --> 01:12:04,630
NEXT ROUND.

1928
01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:05,110
FOR SURE.

1929
01:12:05,230 --> 01:12:06,050
NEXT ROUND.

1930
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:06,630
IT'S FINE.

1931
01:12:06,930 --> 01:12:08,970
THE NEXT GAME, WE LEARN EVERYTHING.

1932
01:12:09,070 --> 01:12:09,970
IT'S WORLD'S EDGE.

1933
01:12:10,050 --> 01:12:11,550
I'M COMFORTABLE ON WORLD'S EDGE.

1934
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:12,770
IT'LL BE SO FINE.

1935
01:12:12,890 --> 01:12:13,830
WE'RE SO HEALTHY.

1936
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:19,590
IS THAT THE ONE WHERE THE RASENGAN THING THERE'S A VORTEX IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MAP OR SOMETHING?

1937
01:12:19,730 --> 01:12:20,110
IS THAT IT?

1938
01:12:20,650 --> 01:12:20,850
NO.

1939
01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:22,610
LAUGHING.

1940
01:12:23,290 --> 01:12:24,410
I DON'T REMEMBER.

1941
01:12:24,490 --> 01:12:25,090
WAS THAT IT?

1942
01:12:25,430 --> 01:12:27,090
THE VORTEX IS...

1943
01:12:28,430 --> 01:12:28,870
OLYMPUS.

1944
01:12:30,050 --> 01:12:31,130
OH, THAT WAS OLYMPUS.

1945
01:12:31,950 --> 01:12:36,850
WORLD'S EDGE IS THE ONE WHERE THERE'S LIKE CITIES AND WILDLIFE.

1946
01:12:36,890 --> 01:12:37,370
NOT WILDLIFE.

1947
01:12:37,430 --> 01:12:38,450
CITIES AND GRASS.

1948
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:39,770
OH, YEAH.

1949
01:12:39,910 --> 01:12:40,190
OKAY.

1950
01:12:40,210 --> 01:12:40,910
NOW I REMEMBER.

1951
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:42,470
AND LAVA.

1952
01:12:44,050 --> 01:12:44,550
OH, YEAH.

1953
01:12:44,730 --> 01:12:45,030
SHIT.

1954
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:46,430
CITY, GRASS, AND LAVA.

1955
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:48,150
THAT'S WORLD'S EDGE.

1956
01:12:48,650 --> 01:12:50,050
IT'S AN OG MAP.

1957
01:12:51,730 --> 01:12:52,210
OKAY.

1958
01:12:52,290 --> 01:12:52,630
ALRIGHT.

1959
01:12:52,730 --> 01:12:56,850
ARE WE ALSO GONNA BE PARTICIPATING IN A SEASON ZERO MAP?

1960
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:57,990
NO, NO.

1961
01:12:58,070 --> 01:12:59,630
IT'S JUST THESE TWO MAPS.

1962
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:01,930
CAUSE THEY'RE THE MOST COMPETITIVE MAPS, BASICALLY.

1963
01:13:02,970 --> 01:13:03,370
ALRIGHT.

1964
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:03,890
OKAY.

1965
01:13:04,190 --> 01:13:04,710
OKAY.

1966
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:05,830
IT'LL BE FINE.

1967
01:13:06,830 --> 01:13:08,110
IT'LL BE FINE.

1968
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:10,170
ARE YOU DOING A PUB RIGHT NOW, JERROD?

1969
01:13:10,870 --> 01:13:11,390
NO.

1970
01:13:11,450 --> 01:13:13,590
I'M ACTUALLY JUST WATCHING SOMEONE HERE RIGHT NOW.

1971
01:13:14,030 --> 01:13:17,030
YOU'RE WATCHING THIS RAT.

1972
01:13:17,150 --> 01:13:18,510
JUST HIDING IN THE DIRT.

1973
01:13:20,490 --> 01:13:22,830
I MEAN, I GOTTA LEARN HOW TO FIGHT.

1974
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:25,050
BRO, HE'S DRIFTING AND HE'S TRYING NOT TO.

1975
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:27,510
HE'S TRYING TO CONTROL HIS DRIFT RIGHT NOW.

1976
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:31,910
HAVING A CALM STATE OF MIND, I THINK THAT'S WHAT MATTERS HERE.

1977
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:33,070
BECAUSE I WAS PANICKING.

1978
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:34,570
AND MY GAME WAS, LIKE, EVERYWHERE.

1979
01:13:34,970 --> 01:13:40,390
I LITERALLY WENT TO A PUB, LIKE, PROBABLY JUST RIGHT BEFORE THIS THING, I THINK.

1980
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:42,170
Or was it a practice round?

1981
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:42,550
I don't remember.

1982
01:13:42,650 --> 01:13:44,030
But, you know, I did some damage.

1983
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:45,070
A little bit.

1984
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:46,830
OH MY GOD, HE CRAFTED?

1985
01:13:47,290 --> 01:13:48,750
HOW IS HE GONNA REST?

1986
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:53,190
HOW IS HE- Oh my god, look, boobs.

1987
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:56,170
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

1988
01:13:56,670 --> 01:13:57,030
Okay.

1989
01:13:58,430 --> 01:13:59,550
He's gonna get fucked, isn't he?

1990
01:13:59,590 --> 01:14:00,290
OH SHIT!

1991
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:01,270
It'll be fine.

1992
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:05,510
There's no way somebody's just gonna walk out of that area and look at him.

1993
01:14:07,010 --> 01:14:07,830
That'll be funny.

1994
01:14:07,830 --> 01:14:08,570
Maybe, maybe not.

1995
01:14:09,450 --> 01:14:10,570
Oh, wait, six squads.

1996
01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:11,210
Oh, shit, okay.

1997
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:12,390
Alright, six squads left.

1998
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:18,910
I think it's consistently the same teams winning, so, like, we still have a chance for top ten, guys.

1999
01:14:19,110 --> 01:14:21,250
We still have a chance!

2000
01:14:24,170 --> 01:14:24,970
Keep on believing.

2001
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:26,750
And it's different people all the time.

2002
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:27,970
We still have a chance.

2003
01:14:29,290 --> 01:14:33,270
I mean, the best chance that we have is actually hot drop and kill the best players.

2004
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:34,710
We can't hot drop.

2005
01:14:34,710 --> 01:14:36,590
I don't know about that one.

2006
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:38,450
I don't think that might not be the case.

2007
01:14:38,830 --> 01:14:41,730
Yeah, I don't think that's the case because they have teammates.

2008
01:14:42,350 --> 01:14:44,130
They're the most vulnerable.

2009
01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:45,170
You're right.

2010
01:14:45,710 --> 01:14:47,650
They still have teammates.

2011
01:14:47,930 --> 01:14:49,970
Hey, we're a team!

2012
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:51,150
What do you call us?

2013
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:52,550
We're a team, right?

2014
01:14:52,850 --> 01:14:58,110
Yeah, but if you drop on one person, I don't think there's enough guns for two people.

2015
01:14:58,830 --> 01:15:00,170
Sorry, I had to correct myself.

2016
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:02,210
Whatever.

2017
01:15:02,210 --> 01:15:03,210
Whatever, it's fine.

2018
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:04,830
Oh my god, that's good.

2019
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:06,110
I didn't know there was a hole there.

2020
01:15:07,530 --> 01:15:10,410
Yeah, can you shoot through that hole or is there an invisible barrier?

2021
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:11,830
No, you can't shoot through the holes.

2022
01:15:12,830 --> 01:15:13,390
God damn.

2023
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:19,250
If you're on top of a building, you shoot under the roof because there's holes there.

2024
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:21,430
I think this world's it.

2025
01:15:21,530 --> 01:15:22,090
No, that's not.

2026
01:15:22,170 --> 01:15:22,690
That's King's Shadow.

2027
01:15:23,490 --> 01:15:24,890
You got triple take.

2028
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:26,890
And it's over.

2029
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:30,490
Stuck between a rock and a hard place.

2030
01:15:30,490 --> 01:15:32,090
Numbers fixed though.

2031
01:15:32,650 --> 01:15:33,430
You tried.

2032
01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:38,470
Oh my god, this is...

2033
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:40,230
This is what we're gonna do.

2034
01:15:41,050 --> 01:15:42,330
Did you buy Rampart?

2035
01:15:44,730 --> 01:15:46,130
Did you buy Rampart?

2036
01:15:46,450 --> 01:15:48,790
You should buy Rampart right now, this game is about to end.

2037
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:50,570
Oh shit, okay.

2038
01:15:51,090 --> 01:15:56,690
So like, you know, when they come back, they'll have to wait for us to buy Rampart.

2039
01:15:57,610 --> 01:15:58,550
Yep, yep, yep.

2040
01:15:58,550 --> 01:16:02,810
Like, one of my worst fears is they actually start immediately after this.

2041
01:16:03,290 --> 01:16:05,530
They'll be like, there's two people there.

2042
01:16:05,710 --> 01:16:06,530
Alright, that's good enough.

2043
01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:08,410
That's fine, he's barely even done any damage.

2044
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:10,030
2 out of 3 is like, almost a pass.

2045
01:16:10,590 --> 01:16:11,410
This is rude.

2046
01:16:11,930 --> 01:16:12,770
Oh my god.

2047
01:16:12,910 --> 01:16:13,490
I'm gonna leave.

2048
01:16:14,410 --> 01:16:16,250
Legend Locker or Rampart.

2049
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:18,110
Um, okay, there we go.

2050
01:16:18,170 --> 01:16:18,930
Controller, okay.

2051
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:20,170
Unlock Legend.

2052
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:24,190
Wait, if we do Rampart, do we run Pathy?

2053
01:16:24,390 --> 01:16:25,290
Or like, Gibraltar?

2054
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:27,970
Uh, I'm probably gonna go Gibraltar.

2055
01:16:28,270 --> 01:16:29,210
Oh wait, can we swap?

2056
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:31,070
I'm better at Gibraltar than Newcastle.

2057
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:32,010
Sure.

2058
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:33,510
Alright, nice.

2059
01:16:34,850 --> 01:16:37,290
Hopefully they don't change the...

2060
01:16:38,450 --> 01:16:40,710
Machine gun fucking shotgun.

2061
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:46,670
Yeah, is there the same people winning the top 3?

2062
01:16:47,490 --> 01:16:48,370
Are you kidding me?

2063
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:50,250
I recognize the names for the top 3.

2064
01:16:52,490 --> 01:16:53,610
Oh my god.

2065
01:16:53,610 --> 01:16:54,970
Look at him go.

2066
01:16:55,590 --> 01:16:56,970
Look at... oh, goodbye.

2067
01:16:58,650 --> 01:16:59,530
He did some movement.

2068
01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:01,430
Oh man, how many more people left?

2069
01:17:01,810 --> 01:17:02,750
Um, zero.

2070
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:04,510
Oh.

2071
01:17:04,970 --> 01:17:05,730
Game over.

2072
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:07,630
Hey, it's over?

2073
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:08,330
Hey!

2074
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:09,810
Did you get it?

2075
01:17:10,410 --> 01:17:11,190
Oh yeah, I got it.

2076
01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:13,150
Yeah, Rampart, make sure you're on Rampart.

2077
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:14,830
Yep, got it.

2078
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:15,570
Okay, yeah.

2079
01:17:16,950 --> 01:17:17,610
Good, alright.

2080
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:19,690
We did it, guys.

2081
01:17:19,810 --> 01:17:20,770
We did it, we did it.

2082
01:17:20,770 --> 01:17:21,510
We did it, everybody.

2083
01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:23,590
We accomplished our first goal today.

2084
01:17:24,710 --> 01:17:26,170
Just buying Rampart.

2085
01:17:28,170 --> 01:17:31,090
Every game we learn something new.

2086
01:17:34,690 --> 01:17:35,850
Okay, alright, alright.

2087
01:17:36,090 --> 01:17:37,070
Okay, I'm confident in this one.

2088
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:37,710
For real, for real.

2089
01:17:37,890 --> 01:17:39,170
Me too, I'm so confident.

2090
01:17:40,230 --> 01:17:42,910
I just realized my chat was dead this entire time.

2091
01:17:43,010 --> 01:17:43,610
Sorry, chat.

2092
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:50,210
I don't know why, but I think it's my CSS, my custom code for my chat.

2093
01:17:50,430 --> 01:17:51,590
Oh shit, you're right, mine too.

2094
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:54,650
I always have to input my code again.

2095
01:17:56,090 --> 01:17:58,830
Not input the code, but I have to refresh my...

2096
01:17:58,830 --> 01:18:00,310
I mean, it's been like that for the longest time.

2097
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:02,390
Oh, so it's just a YouTube update, right?

2098
01:18:03,030 --> 01:18:04,510
Yeah, it's always been like that.

2099
01:18:05,650 --> 01:18:09,610
Let me get this pop-out chat.

2100
01:18:10,110 --> 01:18:11,770
Are you excited about Japan?

2101
01:18:13,770 --> 01:18:15,150
Did you get your visa done?

2102
01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:17,630
Oh, you're going to Japan.

2103
01:18:17,630 --> 01:18:19,870
My visa appointment is going to be on the 24th.

2104
01:18:20,170 --> 01:18:26,050
Oh, because Tempo was telling me about how a lot of pros were really lazy with their...

2105
01:18:26,050 --> 01:18:26,230
Oh.

2106
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:34,310
Tempo was telling me how a lot of pros were really lazy with their visas, so I hope you got your visas done.

2107
01:18:36,050 --> 01:18:38,250
I think that it's like that for everyone.

2108
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:43,030
I definitely stalled it a couple of days at least.

2109
01:18:43,850 --> 01:18:45,610
Are you going there for vacation or what?

2110
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,490
No, championships is in Japan.

2111
01:18:49,730 --> 01:18:51,770
That's why we win this.

2112
01:18:51,890 --> 01:18:54,950
We get to go to Sapporo because that's where it is.

2113
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:56,110
Oh, shit.

2114
01:18:56,410 --> 01:19:00,130
Are they paying for your ticket?

2115
01:19:00,370 --> 01:19:02,690
They definitely should.

2116
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:07,570
Like the event ticket or the plane ticket?

2117
01:19:07,590 --> 01:19:09,770
I think the event, plane, and hotel.

2118
01:19:10,190 --> 01:19:10,890
I could be wrong.

2119
01:19:11,530 --> 01:19:12,370
I could be wrong.

2120
01:19:12,370 --> 01:19:14,030
Damn, now we gotta win.

2121
01:19:14,650 --> 01:19:15,810
Okay, guys.

2122
01:19:17,990 --> 01:19:20,370
Realistic expectations, Daraad, please.

2123
01:19:20,730 --> 01:19:22,110
No, no, no, no, no.

2124
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:23,250
Aim high!

2125
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:24,150
Aim high!

2126
01:19:24,770 --> 01:19:25,950
Too high, Daraad.

2127
01:19:26,130 --> 01:19:27,010
Aiming too high.

2128
01:19:27,170 --> 01:19:28,050
We gotta go!

2129
01:19:28,150 --> 01:19:28,970
We gotta go!

2130
01:19:29,970 --> 01:19:30,910
Where is this?

2131
01:19:31,330 --> 01:19:33,310
We need the optimism here.

2132
01:19:33,790 --> 01:19:35,030
You need to go there.

2133
01:19:35,190 --> 01:19:36,530
I'm doing this for you, man.

2134
01:19:36,690 --> 01:19:37,070
I'm doing this for you.

2135
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:39,550
Oh, shit, Daraad, really?

2136
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:41,670
Yeah, I'm doing this for you.

2137
01:19:41,730 --> 01:19:43,050
I'm doing this for you, buddy.

2138
01:19:43,270 --> 01:19:45,830
I'm gonna drop out as soon as we win every single tournament here.

2139
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:47,510
But, like, Flame's gonna go there automatically.

2140
01:19:47,790 --> 01:19:49,470
It's just, fucking things paid off.

2141
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:51,090
Wait, is it paid off by you already?

2142
01:19:51,170 --> 01:19:51,590
Oh, shit, really?

2143
01:19:53,210 --> 01:19:54,170
It's fine, it's fine.

2144
01:19:54,230 --> 01:19:55,450
I'm doing this for him anyway.

2145
01:19:55,630 --> 01:19:57,430
I'm gonna dedicate this win to you.

2146
01:19:57,450 --> 01:20:00,010
He's literally competing in the championship.

2147
01:20:01,590 --> 01:20:03,090
Fuck, but you know what?

2148
01:20:03,150 --> 01:20:04,310
I still, I don't care.

2149
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:05,910
I'm gonna dedicate this thing for you.

2150
01:20:05,930 --> 01:20:05,930
You know what?

2151
01:20:05,930 --> 01:20:05,930
No.

2152
01:20:06,130 --> 01:20:09,750
He can get those tickets and then ask his org to refund it.

2153
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:11,370
It's like paying his pay in advance.

2154
01:20:12,910 --> 01:20:15,010
I'm doing this regardless of anything.

2155
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:15,850
I'm doing this for you.

2156
01:20:16,070 --> 01:20:17,270
Thanks for teaching me.

2157
01:20:17,630 --> 01:20:18,750
I'll do this for you, man.

2158
01:20:18,770 --> 01:20:19,350
I'm not gonna disappoint you.

2159
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:20,010
What about me?

2160
01:20:20,230 --> 01:20:21,030
I appreciate that.

2161
01:20:21,130 --> 01:20:21,650
Fuck you.

2162
01:20:21,790 --> 01:20:23,030
You've been dissing me this entire time.

2163
01:20:23,030 --> 01:20:24,250
I ain't doing shit for you.

2164
01:20:24,430 --> 01:20:25,690
I'm doing this for Flame.

2165
01:20:26,830 --> 01:20:28,590
Yeah, fuck her, man.

2166
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:30,090
I'm doing this for you, buddy.

2167
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:33,050
Whoa, my god.

2168
01:20:33,090 --> 01:20:35,310
You taught him to fight for himself, Flame.

2169
01:20:35,310 --> 01:20:36,190
You did it.

2170
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:40,130
Yeah, that's what homies do for each other, you know?

2171
01:20:40,730 --> 01:20:41,290
Thank you.

2172
01:20:41,390 --> 01:20:42,630
Thank you for defending my pride.

2173
01:20:43,330 --> 01:20:44,190
Yeah, you got me.

2174
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:45,470
I knew you had it in you.

2175
01:20:49,530 --> 01:20:50,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2176
01:20:50,850 --> 01:20:52,310
I just needed that one push.

2177
01:20:53,610 --> 01:20:54,290
I'm good.

2178
01:20:54,650 --> 01:20:55,910
Is this your first time in Japan?

2179
01:20:57,490 --> 01:20:59,790
Flame, is this your first time going to Japan?

2180
01:21:01,970 --> 01:21:04,010
Yeah, like actually being in Japan.

2181
01:21:04,010 --> 01:21:05,290
Oh, dude.

2182
01:21:05,450 --> 01:21:06,530
I gotta warn you about the trains, though.

2183
01:21:06,830 --> 01:21:09,210
The trains are so confusing.

2184
01:21:09,910 --> 01:21:11,230
You gotta bring in a map or something.

2185
01:21:11,330 --> 01:21:12,270
Yeah, it's very confusing.

2186
01:21:12,650 --> 01:21:14,210
When I went there, I was lost.

2187
01:21:14,610 --> 01:21:17,830
And you gotta bring in a fucking internet connection or something.

2188
01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:18,530
Like a data.

2189
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:22,910
Yeah, you need to rely on Google Maps a lot.

2190
01:21:23,630 --> 01:21:26,030
I should be able to just use roaming.

2191
01:21:28,490 --> 01:21:29,510
Oh, wait, Rampart.

2192
01:21:29,830 --> 01:21:31,150
Am I still going for Rampart?

2193
01:21:31,150 --> 01:21:32,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2194
01:21:32,770 --> 01:21:35,350
He's gonna go Newcastle.

2195
01:21:36,830 --> 01:21:38,250
We got this.

2196
01:21:39,070 --> 01:21:40,210
Don't worry about it.

2197
01:21:40,370 --> 01:21:42,550
My passport was gonna expire tomorrow.

2198
01:21:43,170 --> 01:21:45,190
And I literally renewed my passport today.

2199
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:49,410
I literally went to the passport office.

2200
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:52,250
I have no appointment.

2201
01:21:52,590 --> 01:21:53,450
Renew my passport.

2202
01:21:54,710 --> 01:21:56,250
They just let you in?

2203
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:58,790
I had to wait three hours.

2204
01:21:58,790 --> 01:22:01,010
But I still got it done.

2205
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:02,390
Usually that doesn't work.

2206
01:22:02,470 --> 01:22:02,970
What the fuck?

2207
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:04,450
I didn't know you could do that.

2208
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:05,270
Yeah, you can do that.

2209
01:22:05,490 --> 01:22:07,290
I'm more of an adult than you guys.

2210
01:22:07,610 --> 01:22:09,790
We got the entire fragment.

2211
01:22:11,870 --> 01:22:13,690
I'll loot here.

2212
01:22:14,370 --> 01:22:15,390
I'm starting on left here.

2213
01:22:17,130 --> 01:22:18,430
I'll have my own building.

2214
01:22:18,590 --> 01:22:20,190
Thank you very much.

2215
01:22:22,030 --> 01:22:23,510
Your own building?

2216
01:22:23,950 --> 01:22:24,730
In this economy?

2217
01:22:24,730 --> 01:22:26,550
Get out of here.

2218
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:27,830
You guys got the good stuff.

2219
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:29,710
It's time for me to have the good stuff.

2220
01:22:29,710 --> 01:22:32,350
He gets paid really well.

2221
01:22:33,870 --> 01:22:35,290
Shut the fuck up.

2222
01:22:35,830 --> 01:22:37,090
Is that what I meant?

2223
01:22:39,170 --> 01:22:39,730
Flatline.

2224
01:22:39,850 --> 01:22:41,470
I got my weapons here.

2225
01:22:41,510 --> 01:22:43,510
Let me know.

2226
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:45,630
Triple take.

2227
01:22:45,850 --> 01:22:48,050
That's an electric...

2228
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:49,130
Energy ammo thing?

2229
01:22:50,030 --> 01:22:50,590
Yes.

2230
01:22:52,250 --> 01:22:53,450
I don't know the lingo.

2231
01:22:53,570 --> 01:22:54,370
Shut the fuck up.

2232
01:22:56,450 --> 01:22:58,430
You said that to Flame.

2233
01:22:59,650 --> 01:23:00,590
I don't know that.

2234
01:23:01,490 --> 01:23:02,830
Flame, I'm sorry.

2235
01:23:02,830 --> 01:23:03,690
I'm pretty sure he said that to you.

2236
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:06,550
I'm pretty sure he said that to both of us.

2237
01:23:08,490 --> 01:23:09,670
I think he said that to you.

2238
01:23:09,670 --> 01:23:10,910
I don't even know who I said it to.

2239
01:23:11,890 --> 01:23:13,690
He heard one voice here.

2240
01:23:15,010 --> 01:23:16,470
And then he just fought back.

2241
01:23:17,530 --> 01:23:20,030
Any insult is automatically redirected to me.

2242
01:23:20,030 --> 01:23:20,550
I'm sorry.

2243
01:23:20,710 --> 01:23:23,110
It's just an automatic defense system for me.

2244
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:24,350
I have to defend myself somewhat.

2245
01:23:27,550 --> 01:23:29,390
I thought we got all Fragment.

2246
01:23:34,330 --> 01:23:35,910
Fragment is separate from Monument.

2247
01:23:36,310 --> 01:23:37,430
Oh, that's Monument?

2248
01:23:40,030 --> 01:23:42,950
That's why Fragment is not really as good.

2249
01:23:43,090 --> 01:23:44,610
Because we have to wait for this team to leave.

2250
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:47,050
Before we can take their console.

2251
01:23:47,930 --> 01:23:49,410
Alright, we want to start...

2252
01:23:49,410 --> 01:23:49,710
Oh!

2253
01:23:51,550 --> 01:23:53,750
I did shoot them.

2254
01:23:53,990 --> 01:23:55,190
I think they're mad.

2255
01:23:56,410 --> 01:23:57,570
That was my bad.

2256
01:23:57,750 --> 01:23:59,050
I did shoot them.

2257
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:00,930
Let's start walking towards the console.

2258
01:24:01,190 --> 01:24:02,750
The team on the left is holding Con.

2259
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:04,650
We have to be careful of Epi.

2260
01:24:04,830 --> 01:24:06,450
But I think we should be okay here.

2261
01:24:06,970 --> 01:24:07,750
We need you to scan.

2262
01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:09,670
Alright, I'm heading over.

2263
01:24:11,410 --> 01:24:12,550
I need you to scan the road.

2264
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:14,750
Scan?

2265
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:17,130
Yeah, you're going to need the console.

2266
01:24:17,990 --> 01:24:18,930
Oh, where is it?

2267
01:24:19,650 --> 01:24:20,950
Just follow him.

2268
01:24:22,010 --> 01:24:22,770
We'll teach you.

2269
01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:27,010
Someone might be coming to us.

2270
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:28,570
We have to be a bit careful here.

2271
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:30,570
Give me a sec.

2272
01:24:30,650 --> 01:24:31,710
I'll pop in a bubble.

2273
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:33,690
A little bubble.

2274
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:35,630
Okay, just hold E.

2275
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:38,770
Okay, hope they don't shoot me!

2276
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:40,170
Don't worry, they cannot.

2277
01:24:41,830 --> 01:24:42,510
Thank you.

2278
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:44,270
Okay, we just go.

2279
01:24:45,470 --> 01:24:47,030
Come through this bridge here.

2280
01:24:47,210 --> 01:24:48,510
Which one do I get for Gibraltar?

2281
01:24:51,270 --> 01:24:52,570
I'll do the ult increase.

2282
01:24:52,830 --> 01:24:54,590
Because I don't need the shotgun thing.

2283
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:57,010
You should tell Jara what he should upgrade.

2284
01:24:59,550 --> 01:25:00,410
Left or right?

2285
01:25:01,590 --> 01:25:03,070
Probably just the left.

2286
01:25:03,790 --> 01:25:04,350
Left, okay.

2287
01:25:04,870 --> 01:25:05,670
Ult, okay.

2288
01:25:06,490 --> 01:25:07,850
We'll just go train the geyser here.

2289
01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:10,070
I have my bubble if we need it.

2290
01:25:10,570 --> 01:25:11,830
We have to be careful.

2291
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:13,710
Epicenter might be close.

2292
01:25:15,470 --> 01:25:18,630
They could have rotated towards ghost town here on the left.

2293
01:25:18,790 --> 01:25:19,390
I don't know where they're at.

2294
01:25:19,810 --> 01:25:21,090
Oh wow, you guys are far away.

2295
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:23,550
Were you looting, Jarad?

2296
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:26,290
I was looking for a bag.

2297
01:25:26,410 --> 01:25:27,050
Okay, I'll be back.

2298
01:25:27,470 --> 01:25:28,310
I'm here, I'm here.

2299
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:31,190
Focus, focus, focus.

2300
01:25:31,370 --> 01:25:33,910
I thought you said you got inspired to lock in.

2301
01:25:34,410 --> 01:25:36,290
Yeah, I am, and I have no ammo.

2302
01:25:37,190 --> 01:25:38,170
I can't shoot peeps.

2303
01:25:38,170 --> 01:25:39,970
We need to hit this carry out on my way.

2304
01:25:39,970 --> 01:25:41,270
Hopefully no one's holding this choke.

2305
01:25:41,690 --> 01:25:43,370
I have a 3x so you need it, Flame.

2306
01:25:46,150 --> 01:25:47,810
I can trade you a 3x.

2307
01:25:48,050 --> 01:25:48,810
Close to my left!

2308
01:25:52,270 --> 01:25:52,810
Maggy ball!

2309
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:54,530
You need bubble?

2310
01:25:56,630 --> 01:25:57,030
Yeah.

2311
01:25:57,610 --> 01:25:58,550
I'm gonna ult.

2312
01:26:00,510 --> 01:26:01,930
I'm gonna get shot by a different...

2313
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:02,950
I'm on my bubble right now.

2314
01:26:04,390 --> 01:26:05,130
This is my ult.

2315
01:26:06,050 --> 01:26:08,050
My bubble's gonna go off soon.

2316
01:26:08,230 --> 01:26:09,010
My bubble's gonna end.

2317
01:26:10,290 --> 01:26:11,530
Can you guys slide down to me?

2318
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:12,930
Yeah, I'm sliding, I'm sliding.

2319
01:26:13,070 --> 01:26:13,910
Slide, slide, slide, slide.

2320
01:26:16,510 --> 01:26:17,430
I'm getting shot from behind!

2321
01:26:18,130 --> 01:26:18,510
I'm over.

2322
01:26:20,610 --> 01:26:21,830
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

2323
01:26:22,050 --> 01:26:25,250
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.

2324
01:26:25,810 --> 01:26:27,010
I can rez you here, I can rez you here.

2325
01:26:27,890 --> 01:26:28,690
I'll put a bubble.

2326
01:26:30,470 --> 01:26:31,970
We need to get in the house.

2327
01:26:32,330 --> 01:26:33,190
Okay, I'm going in.

2328
01:26:34,050 --> 01:26:34,670
I'm up here.

2329
01:26:34,730 --> 01:26:36,930
Yeah, I got in, I got in.

2330
01:26:39,010 --> 01:26:40,290
Let me in, let me in!

2331
01:26:40,590 --> 01:26:41,470
You're fine, you're fine.

2332
01:26:42,170 --> 01:26:43,950
Set up the walls, set up the walls.

2333
01:26:44,730 --> 01:26:45,670
We might be getting pushed.

2334
01:26:46,830 --> 01:26:47,690
Yeah, we're getting pushed.

2335
01:26:47,950 --> 01:26:50,630
Put some behind us here.

2336
01:26:51,210 --> 01:26:51,670
They're coming!

2337
01:26:54,350 --> 01:26:55,890
Move back and put rampart covers down.

2338
01:26:56,030 --> 01:26:56,690
Put covers, put covers!

2339
01:26:58,450 --> 01:26:59,230
Cover, cover, cover!

2340
01:26:59,230 --> 01:27:00,930
Watch Q and just left click.

2341
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:03,210
They're behind us, they're behind us.

2342
01:27:03,410 --> 01:27:03,890
They're throwing nades.

2343
01:27:04,030 --> 01:27:04,890
We're okay, we're okay.

2344
01:27:05,310 --> 01:27:06,610
I have to use a bubble.

2345
01:27:07,290 --> 01:27:08,110
There's a frag.

2346
01:27:09,070 --> 01:27:10,510
They might push after this.

2347
01:27:11,230 --> 01:27:12,010
They're close, they're close.

2348
01:27:12,070 --> 01:27:12,490
They're trying to push.

2349
01:27:13,310 --> 01:27:13,810
Get 150.

2350
01:27:15,210 --> 01:27:17,230
I don't have any nades, so...

2351
01:27:17,770 --> 01:27:18,310
They're shooting behind!

2352
01:27:19,850 --> 01:27:21,030
I'm looking at the door.

2353
01:27:21,550 --> 01:27:21,950
They're pushing!

2354
01:27:25,470 --> 01:27:26,170
One guy outside!

2355
01:27:26,350 --> 01:27:27,150
Push, push, push!

2356
01:27:27,610 --> 01:27:28,990
Just heal, just heal!

2357
01:27:30,890 --> 01:27:31,830
Rampart here on the left.

2358
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:33,250
I cracked the Pathfinder.

2359
01:27:35,790 --> 01:27:36,830
Flash, flash, flash!

2360
01:27:37,050 --> 01:27:37,130
Nice!

2361
01:27:38,110 --> 01:27:38,670
Where's the Pathfinder?

2362
01:27:39,270 --> 01:27:41,070
He left, he left, he left.

2363
01:27:41,190 --> 01:27:42,870
Just heal, heal, heal, heal!

2364
01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:44,070
Go, go, go!

2365
01:27:44,210 --> 01:27:45,930
The other team is locked up.

2366
01:27:47,610 --> 01:27:49,010
I'm climbing up to the roof here.

2367
01:27:49,690 --> 01:27:50,970
I thirsted, I thirsted.

2368
01:27:53,170 --> 01:27:54,270
I need help.

2369
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:55,490
Just heal, just heal.

2370
01:27:56,510 --> 01:27:57,290
Oh, I died.

2371
01:27:58,310 --> 01:28:00,050
Can you come outside and rez me?

2372
01:28:00,630 --> 01:28:01,170
Just jump outside.

2373
01:28:02,090 --> 01:28:02,650
I can give bubble.

2374
01:28:04,850 --> 01:28:05,570
Thank you.

2375
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:09,190
I don't know if they're pushing though, so...

2376
01:28:09,190 --> 01:28:10,310
We can loot them here.

2377
01:28:10,710 --> 01:28:11,850
They backed up just now.

2378
01:28:11,930 --> 01:28:12,430
We should be okay.

2379
01:28:14,530 --> 01:28:16,730
I don't have bubble, so I'm going to wait until my bubble is back.

2380
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:18,410
They're still kind of outside here on the right.

2381
01:28:18,570 --> 01:28:19,910
I'm going back inside just in case.

2382
01:28:20,330 --> 01:28:21,130
60 on the Magi.

2383
01:28:21,450 --> 01:28:21,710
Gibby!

2384
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:23,270
I couldn't get in time.

2385
01:28:24,010 --> 01:28:25,350
Can you climb a roof on me?

2386
01:28:25,730 --> 01:28:25,990
Yeah.

2387
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:32,800
Oh my god, I fucked up my roof climb.

2388
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:33,820
In the open here, Magi.

2389
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:36,120
I'm getting shot from the heights though.

2390
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:37,620
There's a charge rifle on the heights though.

2391
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:39,420
We can't play the roof.

2392
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:42,440
Alright, I have bubble.

2393
01:28:42,820 --> 01:28:43,680
Is he above me?

2394
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:46,060
Gibby is above me.

2395
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:48,080
Want me to come over to you?

2396
01:28:49,180 --> 01:28:50,840
There's another team over there, so careful.

2397
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:52,460
I'm heading over to...

2398
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:53,200
Just stay there, Gerard.

2399
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:53,540
Stay there.

2400
01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:54,400
Anchor that point.

2401
01:28:56,780 --> 01:28:57,440
Magi is running.

2402
01:28:58,040 --> 01:28:58,760
They're gone.

2403
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:03,760
I'm going to loot the box in front of me then.

2404
01:29:04,460 --> 01:29:04,860
Yeah, go ahead.

2405
01:29:06,220 --> 01:29:07,140
I'm going to put bubble.

2406
01:29:08,860 --> 01:29:10,480
This guy is so good at the game.

2407
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:13,100
I have heals.

2408
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:13,940
Do you want heals for it?

2409
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:15,460
Guys, I'm surviving.

2410
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:16,660
I'm anchoring.

2411
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:18,600
I only have shield cells here.

2412
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,020
I have one shield cell left though.

2413
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:21,280
It just ran over at overlook.

2414
01:29:22,180 --> 01:29:23,380
Should I go over there?

2415
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:24,600
Just stay there for now.

2416
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:27,280
We need to go into geyser, guys.

2417
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,020
There's a triple take.

2418
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:33,920
I think I'm going to...

2419
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,820
Let's just go in the choke and go in the geyser here.

2420
01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:38,240
I'm going to run a triple take too.

2421
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:39,360
Actually, I'm going to run a nemesis.

2422
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:40,620
I trust myself on nemesis more.

2423
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:43,380
Just come over, Gerard.

2424
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:44,480
Just come over.

2425
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:45,140
Now you can head over.

2426
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:45,740
Do you need heals?

2427
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:46,400
I have heals.

2428
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:47,980
I dropped the syringe.

2429
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:50,340
I dropped another one.

2430
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:52,100
We need to get shield cells.

2431
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:53,260
I only have one shield cell.

2432
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:54,660
There's extra.

2433
01:29:56,060 --> 01:29:57,500
We should rat in this tunnel.

2434
01:29:57,740 --> 01:29:58,300
Come inside.

2435
01:29:58,780 --> 01:29:59,300
I'll close the door.

2436
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:01,620
Just come to me.

2437
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:03,380
They're going to come in from the top side here.

2438
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:04,920
We just rat in the outside.

2439
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:06,740
Outside this door.

2440
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:08,780
Don't make sound.

2441
01:30:08,860 --> 01:30:09,180
Don't slide.

2442
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:11,680
Just crouch if you can.

2443
01:30:12,580 --> 01:30:13,080
Or walk.

2444
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:15,160
Yeah, just...

2445
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,280
I have my walk unbounded.

2446
01:30:16,460 --> 01:30:18,080
So I gotta crouch.

2447
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:20,580
Where do I place my shields?

2448
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:21,740
Don't place anything.

2449
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:23,080
We just wait until they come.

2450
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:25,960
Oh shit, I hear them.

2451
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,740
We just kill the first guy that walks down here.

2452
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:30,620
Let me know when to peek.

2453
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:31,560
I'm hiding behind a rock.

2454
01:30:33,580 --> 01:30:33,760
Yeah.

2455
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:38,640
Get ready.

2456
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:42,180
Peek, peek, peek!

2457
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:46,920
I got him.

2458
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:47,740
Push, push, push!

2459
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:48,740
Push for that!

2460
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:53,680
One by one!

2461
01:30:53,820 --> 01:30:54,300
We got the other!

2462
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:56,160
Knocked out, bitch!

2463
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:57,460
Knocked out!

2464
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:01,460
Okay, Droid.

2465
01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:03,060
When you charge that up...

2466
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:03,440
Am I 28?!

2467
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:07,440
It makes a lot of sound there, Droid.

2468
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:09,060
When you charge that up...

2469
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:10,080
We can hear it.

2470
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:12,720
Oh my god!

2471
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:14,000
Oh shit, sorry!

2472
01:31:14,180 --> 01:31:16,600
They realized you were there because you charged it up.

2473
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:18,080
You charged it up!

2474
01:31:18,460 --> 01:31:20,840
That's why we're like, go, go, go!

2475
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:24,700
Whoops!

2476
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:27,260
Sorry about that.

2477
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:29,760
Okay, I guess we go now.

2478
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:32,680
I didn't know!

2479
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:36,460
Where did you kill the other guy?

2480
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:37,940
I'm so sorry, I didn't know!

2481
01:31:39,020 --> 01:31:40,240
We learn, we learn.

2482
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:41,040
Droid, Droid, Droid!

2483
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:43,940
He's fucking gone!

2484
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:45,580
Let's go, guys.

2485
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:49,240
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait.

2486
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:50,180
I'm following you, I'm following you.

2487
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:51,340
Where'd you go?

2488
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:52,780
Just come outside.

2489
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:57,100
Droid, Droid, Droid!

2490
01:31:57,540 --> 01:31:59,320
Get down, get down, go downstairs!

2491
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:01,640
Droid, Droid, Droid!

2492
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:02,240
The wrong way!

2493
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:06,320
It's okay.

2494
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:06,320
Okay,

2495
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:11,040
going, going, going.

2496
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:13,320
Man it out, man it out!

2497
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:14,940
Oh my god!

2498
01:32:16,220 --> 01:32:18,760
I think there's just one demon geyser in this house here.

2499
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:19,980
I think we want to kill them.

2500
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:21,560
Can you guys come to me?

2501
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:23,720
Don't peek, don't peek.

2502
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:24,980
We wait for Droid to get to us.

2503
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:27,080
That is still the wrong way, Droid.

2504
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:28,880
Droid, Droid, Droid, look at the map!

2505
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:31,520
Just go through here.

2506
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:33,280
Droid, Droid, Droid, follow my pings!

2507
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:35,280
Droid, Droid, Droid, follow my pings!

2508
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:37,240
Follow this ping right here.

2509
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:39,240
You can run fast, it's fine, you don't take a lot.

2510
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:40,960
Other way, other way, other way!

2511
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:42,620
Other way, other way!

2512
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:45,440
Okay, stop moving, Droid, stop moving.

2513
01:32:45,980 --> 01:32:46,340
Okay.

2514
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:47,000
Look to your left.

2515
01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:48,260
Left?

2516
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:49,220
Yeah, go there.

2517
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:51,480
Alright, got it.

2518
01:32:54,340 --> 01:32:59,200
It's like a mouse in a maze.

2519
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:00,820
My direction!

2520
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:02,240
Oh, whoopsies.

2521
01:33:07,580 --> 01:33:10,540
For a job well done, here's a medkit.

2522
01:33:10,660 --> 01:33:12,200
I did it, I moved away!

2523
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:12,680
Yay!

2524
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:14,020
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait.

2525
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:15,620
Healing myself, healing myself.

2526
01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:17,080
This is going to be a little bit rough.

2527
01:33:17,220 --> 01:33:20,980
We have to evac from my red ping here and then land inside the cart.

2528
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:21,980
Okay, that's fine.

2529
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:24,380
Just start coming to me.

2530
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:25,400
I'm coming over, yeah.

2531
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:27,520
Oh, they're set up there.

2532
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:29,800
That's why it's going to be rough.

2533
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:33,860
We have to fly over that team and not crash into anything.

2534
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:37,120
And if you crash into anything, you die, pretty much.

2535
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:39,680
That's why I already got 3kp.

2536
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:44,300
I have to heal, I have to heal, I have to heal.

2537
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:45,160
Just give me a sec.

2538
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:46,840
You should be fine, Droid, you should go.

2539
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:48,220
You don't have to play with me.

2540
01:33:48,820 --> 01:33:51,000
I got hit, so you have to play fast.

2541
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:54,060
You don't have to wait for me.

2542
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:55,100
Yeah, okay.

2543
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:56,340
Just come over, guys.

2544
01:33:58,140 --> 01:33:59,400
We just have to go here.

2545
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:00,620
You should go first without us.

2546
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:02,340
I can just fly.

2547
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:04,380
It should be okay, just come.

2548
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:07,360
1, 2, 3, go.

2549
01:34:07,980 --> 01:34:08,880
Be really careful.

2550
01:34:09,020 --> 01:34:10,920
You have to go straight here and then you have to turn left.

2551
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:12,560
Okay, it's fine.

2552
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:14,700
It's not fine.

2553
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:16,960
Just heal, just heal, just heal.

2554
01:34:18,260 --> 01:34:19,900
Just heal, you will just...

2555
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:21,000
Come inside, come inside.

2556
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:22,280
Okay, we're perfect, we're okay.

2557
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:23,080
We're chilling.

2558
01:34:23,740 --> 01:34:25,220
I have the bubble.

2559
01:34:26,340 --> 01:34:27,120
Healing myself.

2560
01:34:29,140 --> 01:34:30,280
Wait, you made it?

2561
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:34,260
I have no heals, by the way.

2562
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:35,300
Oh, fuck me.

2563
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:37,380
Come with me, we're okay.

2564
01:34:37,780 --> 01:34:39,260
Just fight right on me, I think.

2565
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:41,960
What heals do you need?

2566
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:42,880
On me is the only safe spot.

2567
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:46,720
Don't use the syringe, stop using the syringe.

2568
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:47,840
Stop using the syringe.

2569
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:49,420
Oh, okay.

2570
01:34:49,420 --> 01:34:50,640
Okay, zone is on us.

2571
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,180
We're in a really good spot now.

2572
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:53,840
We're in a really, really good spot.

2573
01:34:55,260 --> 01:34:56,960
Cancel the medkit, use the syringe.

2574
01:34:57,920 --> 01:34:58,040
Okay.

2575
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:00,320
We have to make sure no one pushes us.

2576
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:02,880
Like that game in...

2577
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:05,120
I'll look northwest.

2578
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:06,580
Yeah.

2579
01:35:08,660 --> 01:35:09,700
Gerard, you just live.

2580
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:10,660
I'll look northwest though.

2581
01:35:11,940 --> 01:35:13,280
Yeah, put a wall.

2582
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:15,200
Gerard, put a wall right here for me.

2583
01:35:15,780 --> 01:35:17,240
Right here, in front of me.

2584
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:17,720
Come here.

2585
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:23,080
Put a wall right here so I can look out the wall.

2586
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:24,000
Here?

2587
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:25,900
Yeah, that's good.

2588
01:35:25,980 --> 01:35:27,600
And then you put a wall right here.

2589
01:35:27,980 --> 01:35:29,560
Right here, where I'm peeing.

2590
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:31,000
Put a wall right there.

2591
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:31,960
That's good.

2592
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:32,680
Nice.

2593
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:33,820
That should be fine.

2594
01:35:33,940 --> 01:35:37,100
Put a wall in my corner here, Gerard, facing like this way.

2595
01:35:37,260 --> 01:35:38,640
So we can back up to the wall.

2596
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:40,640
Back up to me, Gerard.

2597
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:41,560
Back up to me.

2598
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:43,320
No, no, make it closer.

2599
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:45,600
You can press X on it.

2600
01:35:45,700 --> 01:35:47,300
And then...

2601
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:50,040
Back up to my corner and place it like right in front of you.

2602
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:50,560
Okay, okay.

2603
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:52,240
Back up to my corner, place it right in front of you.

2604
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:53,760
Make it as tight to the wall as possible.

2605
01:35:54,100 --> 01:35:55,180
Make it even closer.

2606
01:35:55,540 --> 01:35:57,780
Yeah, you're learning.

2607
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:00,680
I'm learning, I'm learning, I'm learning.

2608
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,380
Here, tight to the wall.

2609
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:04,440
Nice.

2610
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:05,620
Okay, this is good.

2611
01:36:07,820 --> 01:36:09,160
I'm gonna look right here.

2612
01:36:09,340 --> 01:36:10,280
I'm looking northwest.

2613
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:12,000
I'm gonna look out northwest the entire time.

2614
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:16,200
Okay, I'm gonna look out through this window here.

2615
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:17,060
Gerard, can you move this wall?

2616
01:36:17,260 --> 01:36:19,420
Move this wall here a little bit forward.

2617
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:23,000
Still make it on the doorway, but put it on the very front side of the doorway.

2618
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:24,320
So we can still use the doorway.

2619
01:36:24,700 --> 01:36:25,440
Wait, um...

2620
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:27,800
Put it at the absolute most front of the doorway.

2621
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:29,420
We can still move left.

2622
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:30,440
Here?

2623
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:33,080
Yeah, just...

2624
01:36:33,700 --> 01:36:34,980
That's fine still, I think.

2625
01:36:35,380 --> 01:36:37,640
Can you put one outside here on me as well?

2626
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:39,940
Yeah, make it...

2627
01:36:39,940 --> 01:36:41,840
This is the last wall, just put one outside.

2628
01:36:42,660 --> 01:36:43,500
Uh, no, no, no.

2629
01:36:43,620 --> 01:36:45,600
Make it face, like...

2630
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:47,760
Make it angled slightly towards, like...

2631
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:48,660
This one?

2632
01:36:49,140 --> 01:36:49,960
Yes, yes, yes.

2633
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:51,220
Oh my god, he's learning!

2634
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:55,720
You can replace this wall here over at the left, Gerard.

2635
01:36:55,780 --> 01:36:56,560
Can you be cracked here?

2636
01:36:56,860 --> 01:36:58,560
Yeah, I can't see him.

2637
01:36:58,920 --> 01:36:59,620
No, it's okay.

2638
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:01,180
Yeah, I can only look at...

2639
01:37:01,180 --> 01:37:02,700
Only one person can look through that.

2640
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:04,560
Even top of big mod, getting killed.

2641
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:05,300
Yeah, yeah.

2642
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:06,360
I'm just looking at here.

2643
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:08,540
There's a team still shooting from up there.

2644
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:10,320
Cause they're safe.

2645
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:13,480
Oh, we're not in zone.

2646
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:16,000
We're not in zone.

2647
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:18,060
Yeah.

2648
01:37:18,540 --> 01:37:19,320
We'll be okay.

2649
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:21,020
There's a spot right here that we can play.

2650
01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:21,620
Okay.

2651
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:23,260
We'll be okay.

2652
01:37:23,620 --> 01:37:25,800
Do you want me to give you anywhere while we rotate?

2653
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:27,720
No, we're okay for now.

2654
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:28,760
Doki, you okay?

2655
01:37:28,860 --> 01:37:29,380
You're getting shot.

2656
01:37:29,380 --> 01:37:29,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2657
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:31,760
They shot me through like the one hole.

2658
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:35,180
This is the only team we have to worry about here.

2659
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:39,080
We cannot let the team on my red ping walk up on us.

2660
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:39,080
I know.

2661
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:39,260
Yeah.

2662
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:40,760
Oh, be careful, Doki!

2663
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:44,160
We're getting shot from behind mod.

2664
01:37:44,340 --> 01:37:44,540
Yup.

2665
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:45,220
Be careful.

2666
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:46,960
We have to be careful of big mod as well.

2667
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:48,220
They can walk out into us.

2668
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:52,280
You generally don't want to use your ulti.

2669
01:37:52,860 --> 01:37:53,140
Okay.

2670
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:54,620
It's like...

2671
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:58,220
Gerard, you have to be careful with the ulti.

2672
01:37:58,220 --> 01:37:59,400
Because you...

2673
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:00,760
You're like really slow.

2674
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:03,000
So only use it for emergencies.

2675
01:38:03,420 --> 01:38:05,560
So get your gun out if you need to.

2676
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:08,260
You're ulting the team behind us?

2677
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:11,320
I think we should just set up.

2678
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:12,480
Guys.

2679
01:38:13,540 --> 01:38:14,220
Can you come to me?

2680
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:15,340
I think we should just set up here right away.

2681
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:15,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2682
01:38:15,620 --> 01:38:16,040
I'm poking.

2683
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:18,340
Going, going, going.

2684
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:20,800
I'm here.

2685
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:21,060
I'm ready.

2686
01:38:25,250 --> 01:38:26,070
Put walls now.

2687
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:26,510
Put walls.

2688
01:38:26,510 --> 01:38:27,350
They're fighting.

2689
01:38:27,490 --> 01:38:28,430
They're fighting.

2690
01:38:29,270 --> 01:38:30,210
Just look up.

2691
01:38:30,230 --> 01:38:31,850
Look up towards the truck there.

2692
01:38:34,630 --> 01:38:35,690
Someone look towards the truck.

2693
01:38:36,070 --> 01:38:36,530
I'm looking.

2694
01:38:36,590 --> 01:38:37,310
I'm looking here.

2695
01:38:39,190 --> 01:38:40,190
Give me a shot.

2696
01:38:41,210 --> 01:38:42,090
They're fighting on the truck.

2697
01:38:43,010 --> 01:38:44,610
I'm looking behind us.

2698
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:45,450
I have to look behind us.

2699
01:38:45,770 --> 01:38:47,050
It's just the truck.

2700
01:38:48,750 --> 01:38:50,370
Can we see if anything is going on on the truck?

2701
01:38:51,710 --> 01:38:52,210
I'm thirsting.

2702
01:38:53,670 --> 01:38:54,530
Oh, he's full HP.

2703
01:38:54,530 --> 01:38:55,530
He's full HP.

2704
01:38:56,050 --> 01:38:56,710
Oh, he's mine.

2705
01:38:57,930 --> 01:38:58,730
Look behind.

2706
01:38:59,710 --> 01:39:00,930
We're getting repped.

2707
01:39:02,010 --> 01:39:03,570
You can come play on me.

2708
01:39:04,170 --> 01:39:04,710
I'm here.

2709
01:39:05,750 --> 01:39:08,010
Enemy is over here.

2710
01:39:09,810 --> 01:39:10,850
There's people in this truck.

2711
01:39:11,110 --> 01:39:12,470
There's a guy playing on this box here.

2712
01:39:12,830 --> 01:39:13,390
They're fighting.

2713
01:39:13,810 --> 01:39:14,530
Get the kills.

2714
01:39:15,890 --> 01:39:16,830
I got one.

2715
01:39:18,030 --> 01:39:18,990
They're fighting on the back.

2716
01:39:19,550 --> 01:39:20,090
I'm here.

2717
01:39:22,690 --> 01:39:23,930
Killed one.

2718
01:39:26,190 --> 01:39:26,990
Gibby.

2719
01:39:28,570 --> 01:39:29,130
It's just Gibby.

2720
01:39:29,950 --> 01:39:30,190
Bubble.

2721
01:39:30,770 --> 01:39:32,650
I'm putting bubble.

2722
01:39:33,670 --> 01:39:34,170
Nice.

2723
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:37,250
We need to go back.

2724
01:39:38,230 --> 01:39:39,330
They're pushing us.

2725
01:39:39,990 --> 01:39:40,470
I hear something.

2726
01:39:41,190 --> 01:39:41,830
On our left.

2727
01:39:44,030 --> 01:39:44,910
They got me.

2728
01:39:45,870 --> 01:39:47,290
Just chill.

2729
01:39:47,290 --> 01:39:47,750
I'm chilling.

2730
01:39:49,790 --> 01:39:50,270
We're okay.

2731
01:39:51,410 --> 01:39:53,070
Wait until next bub and you're going to rez.

2732
01:39:53,150 --> 01:39:53,230
Okay.

2733
01:39:56,230 --> 01:39:56,930
One bubble.

2734
01:39:58,650 --> 01:39:59,030
I'm rezzing.

2735
01:39:59,410 --> 01:40:01,170
Cover me.

2736
01:40:01,350 --> 01:40:03,450
I have to...

2737
01:40:03,450 --> 01:40:03,930
You're okay.

2738
01:40:05,430 --> 01:40:05,950
I'm good.

2739
01:40:06,290 --> 01:40:06,870
I got the rez off.

2740
01:40:07,830 --> 01:40:08,510
Let me know if I'm dull.

2741
01:40:09,330 --> 01:40:09,690
Okay.

2742
01:40:10,170 --> 01:40:10,530
Revived.

2743
01:40:12,350 --> 01:40:13,270
We need to kill...

2744
01:40:13,270 --> 01:40:14,910
We need to make sure this team on the left dies.

2745
01:40:16,050 --> 01:40:17,250
I want to get that loot.

2746
01:40:18,450 --> 01:40:19,430
Yeah, we can.

2747
01:40:19,770 --> 01:40:20,370
I don't think I can.

2748
01:40:20,450 --> 01:40:20,670
It's fine.

2749
01:40:20,830 --> 01:40:21,590
I can ult this.

2750
01:40:23,070 --> 01:40:24,050
They're going to just bubble.

2751
01:40:29,850 --> 01:40:31,170
They're kind of fighting up top.

2752
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:32,710
I'm not really sure what's going on.

2753
01:40:32,870 --> 01:40:33,310
Just don't die.

2754
01:40:34,310 --> 01:40:36,730
We have to kill this Rampart team.

2755
01:40:39,110 --> 01:40:40,930
Blue armor Gibby.

2756
01:40:40,930 --> 01:40:41,050
Gibby.

2757
01:40:42,670 --> 01:40:43,390
Rez.

2758
01:40:43,970 --> 01:40:44,690
E.

2759
01:40:45,090 --> 01:40:47,210
Behind you.

2760
01:40:47,330 --> 01:40:48,310
We're okay.

2761
01:40:50,790 --> 01:40:51,610
We just heal here.

2762
01:40:52,190 --> 01:40:52,570
We have time.

2763
01:40:53,610 --> 01:40:54,030
Just relax.

2764
01:40:55,210 --> 01:40:55,890
I'm right behind.

2765
01:40:56,590 --> 01:40:57,790
Oh shit.

2766
01:40:58,370 --> 01:40:58,730
Oh shit.

2767
01:41:00,030 --> 01:41:00,750
100.

2768
01:41:03,390 --> 01:41:04,310
Gibby is one.

2769
01:41:05,310 --> 01:41:05,930
Be careful.

2770
01:41:06,750 --> 01:41:07,450
You're 1v1.

2771
01:41:08,910 --> 01:41:09,710
Behind you.

2772
01:41:13,060 --> 01:41:13,460
No.

2773
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:16,780
I got him.

2774
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,040
Oh my god.

2775
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:20,220
You can rez me.

2776
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:22,360
Rez me now while they're fighting.

2777
01:41:23,420 --> 01:41:24,800
I'm behind you by the way.

2778
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:25,960
Careful Doki.

2779
01:41:26,060 --> 01:41:26,960
You might walk in the zone.

2780
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:29,740
We have to try and third party this soon.

2781
01:41:30,020 --> 01:41:31,120
Just walk up to me first.

2782
01:41:31,540 --> 01:41:32,120
Fall heal.

2783
01:41:33,060 --> 01:41:33,940
Just fall heal.

2784
01:41:37,950 --> 01:41:38,770
I have nothing.

2785
01:41:38,770 --> 01:41:40,790
We're going to have to bubble up soon.

2786
01:41:41,050 --> 01:41:42,270
Take any ammo you need.

2787
01:41:43,350 --> 01:41:44,810
I don't know what your ammo is right now.

2788
01:41:45,050 --> 01:41:47,870
Oh you have energy.

2789
01:41:47,990 --> 01:41:48,890
You have to bubble up towards the left.

2790
01:41:49,670 --> 01:41:51,170
When we're about to go out.

2791
01:41:51,290 --> 01:41:52,050
Or if we get naded.

2792
01:41:52,390 --> 01:41:53,630
All left?

2793
01:41:54,750 --> 01:41:55,470
Bubble up left.

2794
01:41:56,030 --> 01:41:56,770
Oh my god.

2795
01:41:58,570 --> 01:41:59,110
Just heal.

2796
01:41:59,710 --> 01:42:00,150
You're okay.

2797
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:04,490
I think it's just one guy.

2798
01:42:04,970 --> 01:42:05,810
Yeah, it's just one guy.

2799
01:42:09,870 --> 01:42:10,830
Yes!

2800
01:42:10,850 --> 01:42:12,530
Oh my god!

2801
01:42:13,790 --> 01:42:15,030
Oh my god!

2802
01:42:15,370 --> 01:42:16,070
Oh my god!

2803
01:42:16,070 --> 01:42:17,930
Your clutch is clean!

2804
01:42:18,370 --> 01:42:20,190
Your clutch is clean!

2805
01:42:21,150 --> 01:42:22,630
Oh my god!

2806
01:42:24,190 --> 01:42:26,110
Oh my god!

2807
01:42:26,450 --> 01:42:26,470
Oh my god!

2808
01:42:26,470 --> 01:42:26,910
We're so much better!

2809
01:42:27,330 --> 01:42:28,930
We're so much better!

2810
01:42:29,770 --> 01:42:31,810
Oh my god!

2811
01:42:32,130 --> 01:42:33,510
Oh my god!

2812
01:42:33,990 --> 01:42:35,570
This is insane!

2813
01:42:35,570 --> 01:42:36,350
We did it!

2814
01:42:36,490 --> 01:42:38,150
We did it!

2815
01:42:38,150 --> 01:42:50,610
I told you!

2816
01:42:50,750 --> 01:42:53,230
I told you World's Edge is my map!

2817
01:42:53,510 --> 01:42:54,590
I told you!

2818
01:42:54,690 --> 01:42:55,630
It is!

2819
01:42:55,850 --> 01:42:57,550
It's my fucking map!

2820
01:42:58,270 --> 01:42:59,730
We have 11 kills!

2821
01:43:01,420 --> 01:43:03,270
We have 11 kills!

2822
01:43:03,270 --> 01:43:05,390
Oh my god!

2823
01:43:08,250 --> 01:43:10,590
I'll be right back.

2824
01:43:10,590 --> 01:43:11,010
No!

2825
01:43:11,810 --> 01:43:13,130
My heart was racing!

2826
01:43:14,490 --> 01:43:18,330
I was like, you walked past me when I asked you!

2827
01:43:18,610 --> 01:43:19,370
My heart was crazy!

2828
01:43:20,210 --> 01:43:20,870
I'm so sorry!

2829
01:43:20,990 --> 01:43:22,110
My hands are still shaking!

2830
01:43:23,450 --> 01:43:24,390
I was like, Trey!

2831
01:43:24,890 --> 01:43:26,270
Please receive!

2832
01:43:26,970 --> 01:43:28,490
And you walked away!

2833
01:43:29,830 --> 01:43:31,030
I didn't know!

2834
01:43:31,030 --> 01:43:31,830
I'm so sorry!

2835
01:43:31,830 --> 01:43:32,410
I know!

2836
01:43:32,490 --> 01:43:34,150
You were overloaded!

2837
01:43:34,270 --> 01:43:36,110
You were so overloaded!

2838
01:43:36,490 --> 01:43:37,370
I know!

2839
01:43:37,490 --> 01:43:38,310
I'm so sorry!

2840
01:43:38,450 --> 01:43:39,170
But we did it!

2841
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:40,230
We won regardless!

2842
01:43:40,450 --> 01:43:40,650
Congrats!

2843
01:43:40,850 --> 01:43:41,370
Thank you!

2844
01:43:42,430 --> 01:43:43,550
Oh my god!

2845
01:43:43,570 --> 01:43:45,070
That was a crazy game!

2846
01:43:45,070 --> 01:43:45,550
I know!

2847
01:43:45,910 --> 01:43:46,990
Oh my god!

2848
01:43:47,050 --> 01:43:48,750
I'm gonna remember this forever!

2849
01:43:49,430 --> 01:43:50,170
Holy crap!

2850
01:43:50,250 --> 01:43:50,910
Thank you!

2851
01:43:52,230 --> 01:43:54,110
No more boy failure!

2852
01:43:54,450 --> 01:43:55,770
No longer pregnant!

2853
01:43:56,410 --> 01:43:58,510
My hands are on T-Rex fur!

2854
01:43:58,790 --> 01:44:01,710
I survived at the last thing too!

2855
01:44:02,270 --> 01:44:03,230
You lived!

2856
01:44:03,470 --> 01:44:04,510
You did it again!

2857
01:44:04,910 --> 01:44:05,430
I lived!

2858
01:44:05,670 --> 01:44:05,870
See?

2859
01:44:05,970 --> 01:44:06,570
I told you!

2860
01:44:06,670 --> 01:44:07,270
This is the start!

2861
01:44:07,410 --> 01:44:08,030
This is the start!

2862
01:44:10,630 --> 01:44:11,950
Flav, I told you!

2863
01:44:12,270 --> 01:44:13,270
He's not here right now.

2864
01:44:13,590 --> 01:44:14,290
He's back!

2865
01:44:15,150 --> 01:44:16,130
Flav, I told you!

2866
01:44:16,190 --> 01:44:16,830
This is for you!

2867
01:44:17,230 --> 01:44:18,590
This was for you!

2868
01:44:19,430 --> 01:44:20,150
We're gonna win this!

2869
01:44:21,450 --> 01:44:21,930
Yo!

2870
01:44:25,230 --> 01:44:26,790
That was actually insane!

2871
01:44:26,790 --> 01:44:27,970
That was insane!

2872
01:44:28,150 --> 01:44:28,750
I know!

2873
01:44:29,270 --> 01:44:29,750
Insane!

2874
01:44:31,070 --> 01:44:33,110
And I got that on stream too!

2875
01:44:33,210 --> 01:44:33,830
Holy crap!

2876
01:44:33,990 --> 01:44:34,310
Thank you!

2877
01:44:37,470 --> 01:44:37,950
Dude!

2878
01:44:40,770 --> 01:44:42,550
He's just like, oh my god!

2879
01:44:42,610 --> 01:44:44,170
I'm never gonna do better than that!

2880
01:44:44,610 --> 01:44:46,830
I'm never gonna do that ever again!

2881
01:44:48,210 --> 01:44:49,010
It was crazy!

2882
01:44:49,410 --> 01:44:51,730
You didn't even get to look at your damage because we won!

2883
01:44:51,730 --> 01:44:57,690
We didn't even know what your damage was because you won!

2884
01:44:58,490 --> 01:44:58,890
Wait, what?

2885
01:44:59,310 --> 01:44:59,890
How do I...

2886
01:45:00,270 --> 01:45:01,130
You can't!

2887
01:45:01,270 --> 01:45:02,610
People will see at the top right.

2888
01:45:03,650 --> 01:45:06,950
You have to wait until the VOD's over to see!

2889
01:45:07,690 --> 01:45:08,410
Oh god!

2890
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:11,030
But hey, I think I did...

2891
01:45:11,030 --> 01:45:13,410
Last time I checked, it was like 99 or something.

2892
01:45:13,870 --> 01:45:15,090
That's improvement!

2893
01:45:15,470 --> 01:45:15,810
Yeah!

2894
01:45:16,770 --> 01:45:18,050
It's way better than 14!

2895
01:45:18,050 --> 01:45:19,550
Dude, that's huge!

2896
01:45:20,250 --> 01:45:21,010
Yeah baby!

2897
01:45:23,050 --> 01:45:24,330
Good job!

2898
01:45:25,250 --> 01:45:27,490
Oh my god, that was scary.

2899
01:45:27,670 --> 01:45:31,130
That fucking clutch there was fucking scary because I was like...

2900
01:45:31,130 --> 01:45:33,910
I had a fucking alternator.

2901
01:45:34,070 --> 01:45:35,710
I was like, I need to swap this gun.

2902
01:45:39,970 --> 01:45:45,650
The moment before the clutch when Doki's just screaming Terron, rez me!

2903
01:45:46,290 --> 01:45:47,730
Terron, rez me!

2904
01:45:48,050 --> 01:45:49,190
Rez me, Terron!

2905
01:45:49,310 --> 01:45:50,790
And he's just walking away.

2906
01:45:51,050 --> 01:45:53,770
He's just walking away with his minigun.

2907
01:45:54,290 --> 01:45:56,150
And then I was like, okay.

2908
01:45:56,710 --> 01:45:58,550
That's so funny to watch.

2909
01:45:59,170 --> 01:46:01,170
Okay, we can erase that.

2910
01:46:02,270 --> 01:46:03,210
We won.

2911
01:46:03,850 --> 01:46:04,690
Barla is the one.

2912
01:46:06,470 --> 01:46:07,730
Barla is the one, shut up!

2913
01:46:10,770 --> 01:46:12,010
Oh my god.

2914
01:46:12,010 --> 01:46:12,310
No way!

2915
01:46:13,750 --> 01:46:17,030
Listen, the future might have changed if I had revived you.

2916
01:46:17,130 --> 01:46:18,550
That's true, that's true.

2917
01:46:19,630 --> 01:46:21,190
It's like a butterfly effect.

2918
01:46:21,310 --> 01:46:23,450
If I had revived you, maybe I would have been shot.

2919
01:46:23,690 --> 01:46:24,570
And we would have been all dead.

2920
01:46:26,650 --> 01:46:27,730
Wait, wait, wait.

2921
01:46:27,850 --> 01:46:28,610
Gerard didn't get in.

2922
01:46:28,790 --> 01:46:29,970
Oh, Gerard.

2923
01:46:30,610 --> 01:46:30,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2924
01:46:31,490 --> 01:46:32,750
DM reset, okay.

2925
01:46:34,870 --> 01:46:35,530
How do I go?

2926
01:46:36,770 --> 01:46:38,430
Hero, please reset.

2927
01:46:39,770 --> 01:46:41,370
Gerard didn't get in.

2928
01:46:42,830 --> 01:46:43,670
Wait, what?

2929
01:46:44,070 --> 01:46:44,310
I'm here.

2930
01:46:44,310 --> 01:46:45,070
You didn't get in.

2931
01:46:45,350 --> 01:46:46,050
No, you're not.

2932
01:46:48,610 --> 01:46:50,670
Wait, I'm still here waiting for everybody.

2933
01:46:50,890 --> 01:46:51,850
Yeah, you didn't get in.

2934
01:46:52,250 --> 01:46:53,690
Just reset your game right now.

2935
01:46:57,230 --> 01:46:58,130
Maybe they'll reset.

2936
01:46:58,130 --> 01:46:59,410
They have to nerf us after winning.

2937
01:47:00,350 --> 01:47:04,710
Maybe they're just like, fuck you guys, now you're going to play with 1.1 players.

2938
01:47:08,390 --> 01:47:09,350
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

2939
01:47:09,350 --> 01:47:10,290
Same code?

2940
01:47:10,410 --> 01:47:10,730
Is it the same code?

2941
01:47:10,730 --> 01:47:12,110
Yeah, it'll be the same code.

2942
01:47:12,250 --> 01:47:13,190
I think they are resetting.

2943
01:47:13,550 --> 01:47:15,150
I think he just got a thumbs up.

2944
01:47:17,530 --> 01:47:18,190
Alright, alright.

2945
01:47:22,870 --> 01:47:24,490
Why is it not resetting?

2946
01:47:24,750 --> 01:47:25,870
I'm just going to loot.

2947
01:47:26,490 --> 01:47:28,490
They have to get rid of our momentum.

2948
01:47:29,230 --> 01:47:30,370
Yeah, what the hell?

2949
01:47:30,650 --> 01:47:31,730
We were on that grind.

2950
01:47:32,830 --> 01:47:35,390
You won, we're taking one person away.

2951
01:47:39,590 --> 01:47:42,250
I mean, it's understandable They took out the strongest guy.

2952
01:47:43,870 --> 01:47:46,930
My favorite was also Guys, we gotta be quiet.

2953
01:47:47,130 --> 01:47:50,550
And the truck charges this fucking machine gun.

2954
01:47:51,870 --> 01:47:57,590
It's a big mini gun going And they ran away!

2955
01:47:57,990 --> 01:47:59,230
Yeah, yeah, okay, okay.

2956
01:47:59,230 --> 01:47:59,870
That made sense.

2957
01:47:59,990 --> 01:48:00,990
But you know, we won.

2958
01:48:01,530 --> 01:48:03,070
Let's just forget about that.

2959
01:48:03,190 --> 01:48:03,470
Shall we?

2960
01:48:06,330 --> 01:48:07,270
Forget, forget.

2961
01:48:07,270 --> 01:48:08,350
Okay, there we go.

2962
01:48:08,370 --> 01:48:08,730
I'm inside.

2963
01:48:08,830 --> 01:48:09,130
I'm inside.

2964
01:48:09,230 --> 01:48:09,470
I'm inside.

2965
01:48:12,010 --> 01:48:13,310
Okay, let me drink some water.

2966
01:48:13,410 --> 01:48:15,170
Holy crap, that parched me up.

2967
01:48:17,130 --> 01:48:18,210
Oh my god.

2968
01:48:21,850 --> 01:48:22,910
Okay, here we go.

2969
01:48:23,090 --> 01:48:23,970
Oh my god.

2970
01:48:25,390 --> 01:48:25,930
No, no, no.

2971
01:48:25,950 --> 01:48:26,530
I'm not satisfied.

2972
01:48:26,710 --> 01:48:27,110
No, no, no.

2973
01:48:27,190 --> 01:48:28,050
We gotta get even higher.

2974
01:48:28,410 --> 01:48:29,390
We're gonna get you that one.

2975
01:48:29,530 --> 01:48:30,630
We're gonna get you that dub again.

2976
01:48:31,350 --> 01:48:32,270
Oh my god.

2977
01:48:32,270 --> 01:48:32,830
Oh my god.

2978
01:48:32,850 --> 01:48:33,650
Now, okay, now.

2979
01:48:34,410 --> 01:48:35,870
Oh my god, okay.

2980
01:48:36,090 --> 01:48:40,590
Someone says we really got Gerard Apex champion before GTA.

2981
01:48:43,730 --> 01:48:47,530
Is it that rare of a sight to see me win in life?

2982
01:48:47,550 --> 01:48:49,230
You guys, before GTA 6.

2983
01:48:49,390 --> 01:48:51,070
Oh my god, that's true.

2984
01:48:51,550 --> 01:48:54,690
I can't believe we got Gerard a champion before GTA 6.

2985
01:48:55,350 --> 01:49:01,250
Listen, Gerard, nobody's questioning if you will, like, if you win in life, you know, but winning in Apex.

2986
01:49:02,410 --> 01:49:02,850
That's hard.

2987
01:49:05,570 --> 01:49:07,610
Not everybody wins in Apex, Gerard.

2988
01:49:07,670 --> 01:49:09,650
This is, like, very rare.

2989
01:49:10,450 --> 01:49:11,890
Yeah, I, this is a privilege.

2990
01:49:12,370 --> 01:49:12,890
Thank you.

2991
01:49:13,410 --> 01:49:14,410
Thank you for inviting me.

2992
01:49:14,470 --> 01:49:15,710
I'd like to thank my family and everything.

2993
01:49:16,030 --> 01:49:16,170
Thank you.

2994
01:49:16,370 --> 01:49:16,890
Thank you very much.

2995
01:49:19,450 --> 01:49:19,830
Okay.

2996
01:49:21,230 --> 01:49:22,430
Okay, I'm on a roll.

2997
01:49:22,630 --> 01:49:24,390
My adrenaline is up.

2998
01:49:24,390 --> 01:49:25,730
All right, let's go.

2999
01:49:25,850 --> 01:49:28,130
Now all the teams will actually kill us for real.

3000
01:49:28,410 --> 01:49:29,810
All right, I'm looting the left side.

3001
01:49:30,530 --> 01:49:32,270
I'm looting this side.

3002
01:49:33,210 --> 01:49:34,730
Going super saiyan, huh?

3003
01:49:35,010 --> 01:49:36,730
Now he's, now he's motivated.

3004
01:49:37,450 --> 01:49:38,730
Undergoing through that right now.

3005
01:49:40,430 --> 01:49:43,850
I like how all our mistakes are actually helping us.

3006
01:49:44,210 --> 01:49:55,550
Like, the spiders gave us free kills because we forgot to finish it, and then the delayed reds let us, let us third party.

3007
01:49:55,710 --> 01:49:59,210
Because I think if you res me instantly, we would have fought again.

3008
01:50:00,010 --> 01:50:02,450
But because of that, we didn't fight after.

3009
01:50:03,150 --> 01:50:04,230
We just waited.

3010
01:50:06,610 --> 01:50:08,830
Thankfully, it was, uh, it was all coming together.

3011
01:50:09,110 --> 01:50:10,490
Yeah, everything just came together.

3012
01:50:12,350 --> 01:50:13,770
Can we do it again, though?

3013
01:50:14,510 --> 01:50:15,450
We can do that again.

3014
01:50:15,570 --> 01:50:15,790
I believe.

3015
01:50:15,990 --> 01:50:16,550
Yeah, we can do that.

3016
01:50:16,670 --> 01:50:17,790
Yeah, that's what I like to hear.

3017
01:50:17,870 --> 01:50:18,630
You can do it again.

3018
01:50:18,990 --> 01:50:19,530
We can do it again.

3019
01:50:19,550 --> 01:50:20,590
I think it'll be pretty easier.

3020
01:50:20,590 --> 01:50:21,410
Yeah, yeah.

3021
01:50:21,510 --> 01:50:24,050
Winning another game won't be that difficult, right?

3022
01:50:25,450 --> 01:50:27,290
Yeah, we've got it in our veins.

3023
01:50:27,570 --> 01:50:28,050
Yeah, yeah.

3024
01:50:28,070 --> 01:50:31,110
We literally, like, we've downloaded the, the system.

3025
01:50:31,650 --> 01:50:33,510
Yeah, the VOD is in our brains.

3026
01:50:33,810 --> 01:50:34,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3027
01:50:34,450 --> 01:50:36,130
We just gotta do that again.

3028
01:50:36,290 --> 01:50:36,890
It's in our genes.

3029
01:50:39,470 --> 01:50:40,950
I need a backpack.

3030
01:50:41,010 --> 01:50:42,070
There's another back here.

3031
01:50:42,210 --> 01:50:44,310
I don't have a backpack yet, so I don't want to pick it up.

3032
01:50:45,210 --> 01:50:45,830
Oh, nice.

3033
01:50:46,090 --> 01:50:46,390
All right.

3034
01:50:47,370 --> 01:50:50,150
Uh, we wanna hit monument scan here again.

3035
01:50:50,270 --> 01:50:50,570
Yep.

3036
01:50:54,130 --> 01:50:55,050
Checking, checking.

3037
01:50:55,210 --> 01:50:56,530
Shit, I got nothing here.

3038
01:50:58,130 --> 01:51:02,470
Just, uh, you have to look at monument first, make sure they're gone, and then we can go.

3039
01:51:02,810 --> 01:51:03,250
All right.

3040
01:51:04,170 --> 01:51:06,550
If they're still over there, then we can't go.

3041
01:51:06,870 --> 01:51:08,750
I'm, like, don't have a backpack.

3042
01:51:09,690 --> 01:51:10,130
Whoa.

3043
01:51:11,570 --> 01:51:13,330
Which is not great for me.

3044
01:51:13,350 --> 01:51:14,070
There's a blue helmet.

3045
01:51:14,210 --> 01:51:14,790
I can give you mine.

3046
01:51:14,790 --> 01:51:15,730
No, it's fine.

3047
01:51:15,850 --> 01:51:16,410
It's okay.

3048
01:51:16,470 --> 01:51:17,550
You can hold stuff for us.

3049
01:51:17,670 --> 01:51:18,810
You need it more than I do.

3050
01:51:18,890 --> 01:51:19,330
Come on, here.

3051
01:51:19,450 --> 01:51:20,110
No, it's fine.

3052
01:51:20,190 --> 01:51:23,550
I could, I don't see anyone yet on the scan, but it is looted.

3053
01:51:26,830 --> 01:51:30,390
I'm gonna go to the left house now to loot more because I'm running out.

3054
01:51:30,590 --> 01:51:31,610
I need more stuff.

3055
01:51:32,810 --> 01:51:36,230
Look, we, we won champion and we were landed in fragment.

3056
01:51:36,330 --> 01:51:36,610
I got backpacks.

3057
01:51:36,610 --> 01:51:38,190
How many points does that give us?

3058
01:51:38,270 --> 01:51:38,510
A lot.

3059
01:51:38,970 --> 01:51:39,890
I think it gave us 23.

3060
01:51:41,930 --> 01:51:43,330
Yeah, we got 23, yeah.

3061
01:51:44,130 --> 01:51:45,710
So we're, like, 30 something.

3062
01:51:45,830 --> 01:51:46,410
I think we should go now.

3063
01:51:46,690 --> 01:51:48,050
I think they might have left already.

3064
01:51:48,250 --> 01:51:48,470
Okay.

3065
01:51:48,710 --> 01:51:49,030
Let's go.

3066
01:51:49,430 --> 01:51:50,050
I'm heading over.

3067
01:51:50,830 --> 01:51:52,730
I need a scope for a carbine.

3068
01:51:52,870 --> 01:51:53,990
If you guys find any too.

3069
01:51:54,070 --> 01:51:58,310
There's a really good, there's a really good chance the zone is pulling this way.

3070
01:51:59,210 --> 01:51:59,550
Okay.

3071
01:52:01,570 --> 01:52:01,950
All right.

3072
01:52:02,610 --> 01:52:05,290
Yeah, follow us.

3073
01:52:05,810 --> 01:52:08,170
So, yeah, they're, they're already flying out towards right here.

3074
01:52:08,270 --> 01:52:11,810
This might be an overlook zone, but just, just come here, Gerard, scan, and then we can go.

3075
01:52:11,810 --> 01:52:13,130
Yeah, I'll bubble him.

3076
01:52:13,370 --> 01:52:14,730
Wait a minute, I think I've seen this thing before.

3077
01:52:15,350 --> 01:52:17,790
All right, we're doing the same thing as we've done before.

3078
01:52:18,170 --> 01:52:18,870
Déjà vu.

3079
01:52:19,050 --> 01:52:20,130
Oh, yeah, you're right.

3080
01:52:20,450 --> 01:52:21,490
We're doing the same thing.

3081
01:52:21,690 --> 01:52:25,630
It's as if, like, competitive Apex follows, like, a, like, a routine.

3082
01:52:27,190 --> 01:52:28,170
Oh, what the heck?

3083
01:52:28,170 --> 01:52:29,190
What the fuck?

3084
01:52:29,210 --> 01:52:30,630
Okay, uh, do we go down here?

3085
01:52:30,850 --> 01:52:32,050
Hit this, uh, cache?

3086
01:52:32,730 --> 01:52:33,650
Towards my yellow, I guess.

3087
01:52:33,950 --> 01:52:34,490
Let's go now.

3088
01:52:35,390 --> 01:52:35,590
Yeah.

3089
01:52:38,680 --> 01:52:39,980
Okay, we go there.

3090
01:52:39,980 --> 01:52:42,340
Where did it go?

3091
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:43,260
Overlook, then.

3092
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:45,560
I don't know.

3093
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:47,880
I guess that was just climatizer going overlook.

3094
01:52:49,380 --> 01:52:55,020
Uh, yeah, okay, we need to hit this cache and then just be in one of these, like, houses here.

3095
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:57,160
Oh, I'm queuing.

3096
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:58,240
I'll give you a bubble too.

3097
01:52:59,740 --> 01:53:00,640
There's a triple take here.

3098
01:53:00,700 --> 01:53:01,480
There's a triple take right here.

3099
01:53:01,600 --> 01:53:02,540
Oh, that guy is crazy.

3100
01:53:03,060 --> 01:53:03,920
Yeah, grab that.

3101
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:06,580
Yo, taking out the champions right at once.

3102
01:53:06,740 --> 01:53:07,160
Do you need the 3x?

3103
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:07,400
Okay.

3104
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:09,980
I don't have a bubble.

3105
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:11,520
Alright, we go, we go.

3106
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:13,380
We just, we just want to run up here.

3107
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:14,440
Yeah, just run, just run, just run.

3108
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:16,260
I have another bubble in 12 seconds, so we need it.

3109
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:18,980
Yeah, I have, uh, Newcastle slam.

3110
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:20,800
I have, uh, the ulti.

3111
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:21,640
I'm fine.

3112
01:53:21,780 --> 01:53:22,200
Just keep running.

3113
01:53:22,520 --> 01:53:24,140
Let's try and, like, move left, right.

3114
01:53:24,140 --> 01:53:24,560
I'm gonna get the cache.

3115
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:25,400
Just move left, right.

3116
01:53:25,540 --> 01:53:27,640
Yeah, we need to grab cache here and then we just rotate.

3117
01:53:28,340 --> 01:53:30,880
We can run through Harvester Choke and just...

3118
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:34,020
Wait, why don't I just get as deep in as possible?

3119
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:35,500
You go, you go to get the cache.

3120
01:53:35,560 --> 01:53:36,800
I'm gonna loot this real fast.

3121
01:53:37,540 --> 01:53:37,820
Yeah.

3122
01:53:41,710 --> 01:53:42,270
Oh, shit.

3123
01:53:42,870 --> 01:53:43,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3124
01:53:43,430 --> 01:53:44,010
I'm looting.

3125
01:53:44,190 --> 01:53:45,270
I'm, I'm, I'm healing, I'm healing.

3126
01:53:47,390 --> 01:53:47,910
Let me know.

3127
01:53:47,950 --> 01:53:49,130
They're on the tracks, on the tracks.

3128
01:53:49,230 --> 01:53:49,790
They're running away.

3129
01:53:49,810 --> 01:53:51,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, they're on the train tracks.

3130
01:53:51,110 --> 01:53:51,770
Nope, they're not running away.

3131
01:53:51,890 --> 01:53:52,150
I lied.

3132
01:53:52,890 --> 01:53:53,410
I'm looking.

3133
01:53:53,610 --> 01:53:56,110
They just, Rampart, uh, just start putting Qs down.

3134
01:53:56,330 --> 01:53:57,310
They're trying to fight us, I think.

3135
01:53:57,390 --> 01:53:57,910
Trying to fight us.

3136
01:53:58,050 --> 01:53:59,230
Okay, I'm gonna ult this.

3137
01:54:01,930 --> 01:54:02,770
They ulted us.

3138
01:54:04,330 --> 01:54:05,470
1 HP, Rampart.

3139
01:54:05,510 --> 01:54:08,810
Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, below, below, below, below, below, below, right here, right here, right here.

3140
01:54:09,990 --> 01:54:11,530
Newcastle one, Newcastle one, in your ulti.

3141
01:54:11,610 --> 01:54:12,070
He's dead, he's dead.

3142
01:54:12,210 --> 01:54:12,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm pushing up.

3143
01:54:12,830 --> 01:54:13,390
You guys win this.

3144
01:54:14,690 --> 01:54:15,330
I'm pushing up.

3145
01:54:15,490 --> 01:54:16,710
You can play aggressive, you can play aggressive.

3146
01:54:16,850 --> 01:54:17,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm pushing up, pushing up, pushing up.

3147
01:54:18,410 --> 01:54:19,290
Be behind her, Doki.

3148
01:54:19,650 --> 01:54:21,570
Uh, Druid, rezzing right here, rezzing right here, rezzing right here.

3149
01:54:21,590 --> 01:54:22,410
I know, I know, I'm pushing, I'm pushing.

3150
01:54:22,490 --> 01:54:22,970
Peek this, peek this, peek this.

3151
01:54:23,470 --> 01:54:24,830
There's a Rampart looking at you, Doki.

3152
01:54:25,390 --> 01:54:26,210
Druid, come fight.

3153
01:54:26,450 --> 01:54:27,370
I need him fight, oh!

3154
01:54:27,410 --> 01:54:28,270
Just run, just run, Druid.

3155
01:54:28,510 --> 01:54:29,710
Just run, just run, just run, just run.

3156
01:54:29,890 --> 01:54:31,010
I could, I got shot by it.

3157
01:54:31,050 --> 01:54:32,090
Just run, Druid, that's alright.

3158
01:54:32,650 --> 01:54:34,010
I don't think he can run anymore.

3159
01:54:34,110 --> 01:54:34,810
Just run, just run.

3160
01:54:34,810 --> 01:54:35,210
Oh, okay.

3161
01:54:35,830 --> 01:54:38,110
He's heavy focus, he's just in his zone.

3162
01:54:39,830 --> 01:54:40,270
God!

3163
01:54:41,690 --> 01:54:43,410
I went the left side.

3164
01:54:44,570 --> 01:54:45,850
Yeah, it's unfortunate.

3165
01:54:46,570 --> 01:54:46,950
It's okay.

3166
01:54:47,490 --> 01:54:48,670
Oh, that was so close.

3167
01:54:50,330 --> 01:54:52,330
Man, but that was alright, that was alright.

3168
01:54:52,390 --> 01:54:53,410
I think I, oh...

3169
01:54:54,610 --> 01:54:55,450
We won, though.

3170
01:54:55,950 --> 01:54:56,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3171
01:54:56,570 --> 01:54:57,170
We won a game.

3172
01:54:57,830 --> 01:54:59,990
We don't need this game, technically.

3173
01:54:59,990 --> 01:55:00,670
We don't...

3174
01:55:01,210 --> 01:55:05,130
We were top four, apparently, with that game.

3175
01:55:05,210 --> 01:55:06,330
Oh, my God.

3176
01:55:06,470 --> 01:55:09,290
Wait, we're top four with that one game?

3177
01:55:09,590 --> 01:55:10,030
Yeah!

3178
01:55:10,030 --> 01:55:10,370
Really?

3179
01:55:10,830 --> 01:55:11,230
No, it's crazy!

3180
01:55:11,610 --> 01:55:12,730
That's crazy!

3181
01:55:12,730 --> 01:55:14,710
We lost every one, but, you know...

3182
01:55:14,710 --> 01:55:15,150
Wow, we're top four.

3183
01:55:15,150 --> 01:55:16,630
Okay, the last game, we...

3184
01:55:19,050 --> 01:55:20,250
You guys did great.

3185
01:55:20,510 --> 01:55:21,290
You did awesome.

3186
01:55:21,430 --> 01:55:23,390
That's crazy that we're top four with one game.

3187
01:55:23,390 --> 01:55:23,910
You did great, Druid.

3188
01:55:24,370 --> 01:55:25,250
You did great, Druid.

3189
01:55:25,370 --> 01:55:26,190
We believed in you.

3190
01:55:26,530 --> 01:55:29,050
Yeah, a little bit, but you guys did most of the damage, so...

3191
01:55:29,690 --> 01:55:31,110
Yeah, great, great, great.

3192
01:55:31,110 --> 01:55:32,090
I'm actually curious, though.

3193
01:55:32,150 --> 01:55:34,990
What do you hear when we say, just run?

3194
01:55:36,270 --> 01:55:38,410
Um, run, but to them.

3195
01:55:41,410 --> 01:55:43,670
I was like, okay, I think I can take him.

3196
01:55:43,870 --> 01:55:45,870
My brain says, I think I can take him.

3197
01:55:46,650 --> 01:55:48,430
I was like, what's in your...

3198
01:55:49,670 --> 01:55:51,930
His brain was like, just run, just run.

3199
01:55:52,150 --> 01:55:53,930
And then you, you like, ran.

3200
01:55:54,590 --> 01:55:58,230
I was just like, okay, I don't know if he's muted or anything.

3201
01:55:58,230 --> 01:55:58,610
I don't...

3202
01:55:59,550 --> 01:56:00,610
Okay, not gonna lie.

3203
01:56:00,710 --> 01:56:02,890
Sometimes, like, I don't hear any words at all.

3204
01:56:03,050 --> 01:56:06,310
It's like, I'm just so genuinely focused.

3205
01:56:06,710 --> 01:56:10,290
And I, like, cast, like, words, like, come out the other ear.

3206
01:56:10,490 --> 01:56:11,390
I'm so sorry.

3207
01:56:11,550 --> 01:56:12,350
That's funny.

3208
01:56:14,850 --> 01:56:16,530
It's just the way Gerard T.

3209
01:56:16,750 --> 01:56:17,390
Rexford's built.

3210
01:56:17,510 --> 01:56:18,170
I'm sorry.

3211
01:56:20,450 --> 01:56:22,910
I'm built different, and I'm sorry about that.

3212
01:56:23,130 --> 01:56:23,630
We won, though.

3213
01:56:23,710 --> 01:56:24,150
We won, though.

3214
01:56:24,230 --> 01:56:24,550
It's okay.

3215
01:56:24,630 --> 01:56:25,070
Yeah, we won.

3216
01:56:25,150 --> 01:56:25,490
We won.

3217
01:56:25,570 --> 01:56:26,050
It's okay.

3218
01:56:26,270 --> 01:56:26,630
We literally...

3219
01:56:27,330 --> 01:56:28,990
I don't know if we're actually top four.

3220
01:56:29,070 --> 01:56:30,630
I saw someone in my chat said top four.

3221
01:56:30,750 --> 01:56:32,510
So they could be gaslighting.

3222
01:56:34,390 --> 01:56:35,690
We might not even be.

3223
01:56:35,950 --> 01:56:36,970
We might not be.

3224
01:56:37,090 --> 01:56:37,950
We're gonna get...

3225
01:56:37,950 --> 01:56:38,370
Next one.

3226
01:56:38,470 --> 01:56:38,850
Next one.

3227
01:56:38,950 --> 01:56:39,230
For sure.

3228
01:56:39,710 --> 01:56:41,170
We're definitely not last.

3229
01:56:41,230 --> 01:56:42,030
That's for sure.

3230
01:56:42,990 --> 01:56:43,790
Not last.

3231
01:56:43,970 --> 01:56:45,210
Okay, I'm gonna learn from that.

3232
01:56:45,290 --> 01:56:47,630
It's like, I'm not, I'm not gonna fight when you say run.

3233
01:56:48,110 --> 01:56:48,330
Okay.

3234
01:56:48,590 --> 01:56:48,930
Yeah.

3235
01:56:49,010 --> 01:56:51,770
I'm gonna apply that to my, my AI.

3236
01:56:51,990 --> 01:56:52,910
AI of a brain.

3237
01:56:53,170 --> 01:56:53,710
I'm gonna do that.

3238
01:56:53,710 --> 01:56:55,630
I think, I think...

3239
01:56:55,630 --> 01:56:56,650
Yeah, like, just run.

3240
01:56:56,770 --> 01:56:59,050
If I'm down, you fucking run.

3241
01:56:59,830 --> 01:57:01,010
Yeah, I'm running.

3242
01:57:01,310 --> 01:57:02,130
I'm definitely gonna run.

3243
01:57:02,150 --> 01:57:03,450
Do I pick up your stuff or...

3244
01:57:03,450 --> 01:57:05,570
No, no, you fucking just leave.

3245
01:57:06,210 --> 01:57:07,010
Just leave?

3246
01:57:07,090 --> 01:57:07,390
Just leave.

3247
01:57:07,390 --> 01:57:08,450
How do I revive you?

3248
01:57:08,570 --> 01:57:09,110
You can craft.

3249
01:57:09,430 --> 01:57:09,970
You craft this.

3250
01:57:10,010 --> 01:57:10,670
Okay, okay, okay.

3251
01:57:10,790 --> 01:57:11,950
It doesn't matter anymore.

3252
01:57:12,090 --> 01:57:13,150
You don't have to pick us up anymore.

3253
01:57:13,230 --> 01:57:14,270
You just gotta craft this.

3254
01:57:14,990 --> 01:57:15,450
Oh, okay.

3255
01:57:15,670 --> 01:57:15,990
All right.

3256
01:57:17,570 --> 01:57:18,610
Watch this rampart.

3257
01:57:18,710 --> 01:57:19,670
It's time to VOD review.

3258
01:57:19,950 --> 01:57:20,990
You watch this rampart.

3259
01:57:21,550 --> 01:57:22,910
Yeah, I'm watching it right now.

3260
01:57:22,910 --> 01:57:24,430
Checking the six.

3261
01:57:24,850 --> 01:57:27,130
Okay, also, Gerard, you gotta not rely...

3262
01:57:27,130 --> 01:57:28,850
You need to stop relying on your minigun.

3263
01:57:32,090 --> 01:57:32,850
I'm sorry.

3264
01:57:33,070 --> 01:57:34,630
It's just so cool to bring it out.

3265
01:57:34,990 --> 01:57:35,590
I know, I know.

3266
01:57:36,110 --> 01:57:41,070
I feel like every time we're close to anybody, you just bring out the minigun.

3267
01:57:42,810 --> 01:57:44,810
It's a quick problem solver.

3268
01:57:45,010 --> 01:57:46,210
Like, health gone.

3269
01:57:46,470 --> 01:57:46,950
That's me.

3270
01:57:47,030 --> 01:57:47,790
That's my brain.

3271
01:57:48,630 --> 01:57:49,850
Shooty, shooty, bang, bang.

3272
01:57:49,910 --> 01:57:50,590
That's my brain.

3273
01:57:52,710 --> 01:57:53,570
Okay, okay.

3274
01:57:53,590 --> 01:57:54,010
Learn it.

3275
01:57:54,090 --> 01:57:54,470
Got it.

3276
01:57:54,530 --> 01:57:55,190
Note taken.

3277
01:57:55,450 --> 01:57:55,870
All right.

3278
01:57:55,870 --> 01:57:58,730
My chat is at that part where we're yelling at you to run.

3279
01:57:59,230 --> 01:58:03,230
And everybody in my chat was just like, no, not to them.

3280
01:58:09,010 --> 01:58:10,270
Yeah, that's what my chat says.

3281
01:58:10,310 --> 01:58:11,130
They're giving chance to others.

3282
01:58:11,230 --> 01:58:12,210
Yeah, yeah, because we won.

3283
01:58:12,430 --> 01:58:13,270
Yeah, exactly.

3284
01:58:13,370 --> 01:58:15,430
Won other teams that have a chance too.

3285
01:58:15,650 --> 01:58:16,090
Exactly.

3286
01:58:16,430 --> 01:58:17,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3287
01:58:17,870 --> 01:58:20,930
It wouldn't be really fun if we actually won another one.

3288
01:58:20,930 --> 01:58:21,630
Just saying.

3289
01:58:25,350 --> 01:58:26,190
I'm okay.

3290
01:58:26,270 --> 01:58:26,610
Not gonna lie.

3291
01:58:26,610 --> 01:58:28,990
I'm still caught up on the win, though, because my heart is still racing.

3292
01:58:29,030 --> 01:58:30,710
You're still thinking about it.

3293
01:58:30,750 --> 01:58:35,210
Yeah, because you guys are having wins and dubs every single time.

3294
01:58:35,490 --> 01:58:36,950
Me, this is like a first time.

3295
01:58:37,190 --> 01:58:38,310
Like a legit thing.

3296
01:58:38,630 --> 01:58:42,730
Like, I only won five times in like throughout my entire life.

3297
01:58:43,050 --> 01:58:44,190
Just five times.

3298
01:58:44,430 --> 01:58:45,870
Wait, apparently.

3299
01:58:47,750 --> 01:58:52,350
Apparently, the team that won a 1v1 against was Estelle's team.

3300
01:58:54,410 --> 01:58:58,810
Yo, you beat your senpai!

3301
01:59:01,770 --> 01:59:04,410
You actually predicted that shit!

3302
01:59:05,050 --> 01:59:06,150
Oh my god!

3303
01:59:06,230 --> 01:59:08,050
I didn't think we'd be running into them!

3304
01:59:08,790 --> 01:59:09,690
Holy crap!

3305
01:59:10,430 --> 01:59:11,150
Oh my god, you did it.

3306
01:59:11,170 --> 01:59:11,950
I'm going to be a senpai!

3307
01:59:12,130 --> 01:59:12,470
Holy crap!

3308
01:59:12,490 --> 01:59:13,570
How do you feel, Droid?

3309
01:59:13,790 --> 01:59:14,370
How do you feel?

3310
01:59:14,370 --> 01:59:15,530
I feel so fucking pumped.

3311
01:59:15,530 --> 01:59:18,150
I sure do hope that they don't get angry at me.

3312
01:59:19,430 --> 01:59:23,070
Because there's this fucking bronze guy inside this very serious tournament.

3313
01:59:25,710 --> 01:59:26,550
I am so...

3314
01:59:26,550 --> 01:59:29,750
Aste-senpai, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

3315
01:59:30,150 --> 01:59:31,170
I didn't mean it.

3316
01:59:31,270 --> 01:59:32,290
I was just here to have fun.

3317
01:59:32,350 --> 01:59:33,950
I didn't think we'd be actually winning.

3318
01:59:34,090 --> 01:59:34,950
My god.

3319
01:59:35,950 --> 01:59:37,430
I'm just here to fill in a role.

3320
01:59:37,710 --> 01:59:38,610
You just have to believe, Droid.

3321
01:59:38,630 --> 01:59:39,230
You just have to believe.

3322
01:59:39,510 --> 01:59:40,010
You believe.

3323
01:59:40,210 --> 01:59:40,710
Yeah, believe.

3324
01:59:41,230 --> 01:59:42,890
The power in believing in yourself.

3325
01:59:43,930 --> 01:59:44,270
I get it now.

3326
01:59:44,270 --> 01:59:45,390
My chat caught up.

3327
01:59:45,490 --> 01:59:46,250
We are top 4.

3328
01:59:47,130 --> 01:59:47,550
Yeah, top 4!

3329
01:59:47,550 --> 01:59:49,150
I don't think we're top 4 after this, though.

3330
01:59:49,390 --> 01:59:50,810
We're not going to be top 4 anymore.

3331
01:59:51,070 --> 01:59:52,190
I don't think anymore.

3332
01:59:52,610 --> 01:59:54,410
But like, we were top 4.

3333
01:59:56,510 --> 01:59:58,350
Great, great, great, great.

3334
01:59:58,830 --> 02:00:00,910
What are the requirements for us to actually...

3335
02:00:01,470 --> 02:00:02,050
Top 10.

3336
02:00:02,230 --> 02:00:03,630
...win to go to top 10?

3337
02:00:03,650 --> 02:00:04,130
Wait, we need...

3338
02:00:04,130 --> 02:00:06,410
No, well, to go to Japan, we have to win-win.

3339
02:00:06,550 --> 02:00:07,430
But that's on the day 3.

3340
02:00:07,950 --> 02:00:08,910
That's on day 3.

3341
02:00:09,290 --> 02:00:11,070
But right now, we gotta get to top 10.

3342
02:00:11,890 --> 02:00:12,690
Okay, all right.

3343
02:00:13,430 --> 02:00:13,950
All right.

3344
02:00:13,950 --> 02:00:15,670
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

3345
02:00:15,730 --> 02:00:16,630
The top...

3346
02:00:16,630 --> 02:00:17,490
That's crazy.

3347
02:00:17,750 --> 02:00:21,350
We're 16 points behind first and 16 points ahead 11.

3348
02:00:21,510 --> 02:00:24,010
Oh, so it's very close.

3349
02:00:24,850 --> 02:00:27,590
Because we're only 16 points ahead of 11th place.

3350
02:00:28,690 --> 02:00:29,690
Great, great.

3351
02:00:29,890 --> 02:00:31,110
I'm feeling good about this one.

3352
02:00:31,210 --> 02:00:32,670
It could be anyone's game here.

3353
02:00:34,310 --> 02:00:38,770
All right, I think we might need to play safe for that then.

3354
02:00:39,510 --> 02:00:42,010
Because the lead is not that far off.

3355
02:00:44,310 --> 02:00:46,410
Flame, what's the strat for the last game?

3356
02:00:48,470 --> 02:00:50,110
Is it still the same map?

3357
02:00:50,310 --> 02:00:51,150
We just do the same thing?

3358
02:00:51,870 --> 02:00:52,270
Yep.

3359
02:00:52,590 --> 02:00:53,370
We just do the same thing?

3360
02:00:54,730 --> 02:00:55,490
Yeah, same map.

3361
02:00:55,590 --> 02:00:58,930
We just do the same thing and hope we don't get ran at again.

3362
02:01:00,090 --> 02:01:01,350
I mean, we almost won that fight.

3363
02:01:01,350 --> 02:01:04,530
See, the Rampart's using the thingy, the machine gun.

3364
02:01:05,670 --> 02:01:06,130
Okay, but...

3365
02:01:06,130 --> 02:01:07,950
They're using it, why can't I use it?

3366
02:01:09,490 --> 02:01:12,810
Jirai, do you think she's bronze, Jirai?

3367
02:01:16,250 --> 02:01:16,970
Everyone is!

3368
02:01:17,730 --> 02:01:21,470
I'm sorry to make mistakes, Jirai, but they're not bronze.

3369
02:01:22,310 --> 02:01:24,790
You need to know when you can use it and when you don't.

3370
02:01:25,110 --> 02:01:26,370
Like, when you can't use it, you know?

3371
02:01:26,370 --> 02:01:27,590
But I feel it, though!

3372
02:01:27,730 --> 02:01:28,750
I feel it in my bones!

3373
02:01:28,770 --> 02:01:30,510
I think they know, and I don't.

3374
02:01:30,570 --> 02:01:32,350
I'm not sure if you do, Jirai.

3375
02:01:32,510 --> 02:01:33,370
Oh yeah, I do.

3376
02:01:33,370 --> 02:01:34,230
I'm not sure if you do.

3377
02:01:34,750 --> 02:01:35,410
I know.

3378
02:01:36,210 --> 02:01:36,570
Jirai!

3379
02:01:36,590 --> 02:01:37,270
You just have to believe.

3380
02:01:37,310 --> 02:01:38,510
What happened to believing in me?

3381
02:01:38,530 --> 02:01:39,370
Jirai, you bring out your anger!

3382
02:01:39,610 --> 02:01:40,670
I'm sorry, Jirai.

3383
02:01:40,670 --> 02:01:46,390
If believing was all it took to turn someone into a pro player, I think we'd have a lot more pro players, Jirai.

3384
02:01:46,390 --> 02:01:47,070
We have to believe!

3385
02:01:47,170 --> 02:01:48,670
If we don't believe, then there's no way we can do it!

3386
02:01:48,670 --> 02:01:54,750
Yeah, but he has to give you rea- Jirai, there's delusional, and there's delusions!

3387
02:01:55,730 --> 02:01:57,110
Our delusion is actually worse than theirs!

3388
02:01:57,110 --> 02:01:58,610
There's confidence, Jirai, and then there's delusion, okay?

3389
02:01:58,610 --> 02:01:59,270
I'm just saying!

3390
02:01:59,650 --> 02:02:03,510
I think you're- We won, and despite everything, I think we can do this!

3391
02:02:03,530 --> 02:02:06,410
You're a little bit past- I think you're a little bit past confidence, Jirai.

3392
02:02:06,610 --> 02:02:07,050
Yeah!

3393
02:02:07,530 --> 02:02:10,190
I think we need to give you a little bit of a reality check.

3394
02:02:10,190 --> 02:02:16,010
The reality is- You're a pro player, and he needs to give you a reality check right now.

3395
02:02:16,190 --> 02:02:17,010
No, no, no, no.

3396
02:02:17,130 --> 02:02:19,710
The reality is, anything is possible.

3397
02:02:20,110 --> 02:02:21,790
It could be anyone's game, right?

3398
02:02:21,870 --> 02:02:22,130
Okay.

3399
02:02:22,230 --> 02:02:22,810
It could be anyone.

3400
02:02:22,930 --> 02:02:30,910
Jirai, I also think that- Jirai, okay, so like- But the thing- The difference between this Rampart- You see that she has her regular gun out?

3401
02:02:31,910 --> 02:02:33,350
Yeah, you see that?

3402
02:02:33,970 --> 02:02:35,030
Uh-huh, yeah, you're right.

3403
02:02:35,050 --> 02:02:38,510
You see- You see she has her normal gun out?

3404
02:02:38,910 --> 02:02:40,030
But I'm different, though!

3405
02:02:40,030 --> 02:02:40,750
I'm different!

3406
02:02:42,470 --> 02:02:44,410
Where's the- I'm built different, Jirai.

3407
02:02:44,730 --> 02:02:46,150
I'm built different.

3408
02:02:46,190 --> 02:02:49,370
You see how she's shooting with her triple take?

3409
02:02:51,150 --> 02:02:52,470
Listen, listen.

3410
02:02:53,710 --> 02:02:56,350
As long as we believe, anything's possible.

3411
02:03:01,420 --> 02:03:05,640
If you- If she brought out her minigun, do you think that would have been a smarter idea?

3412
02:03:08,820 --> 02:03:09,800
It's all right!

3413
02:03:09,880 --> 02:03:10,820
A gun's a gun!

3414
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:11,760
A gun's a gun!

3415
02:03:11,780 --> 02:03:13,020
Man, anything's possible.

3416
02:03:13,860 --> 02:03:15,120
But okay, fine, fine, fine.

3417
02:03:15,120 --> 02:03:16,080
That's true, anything's possible.

3418
02:03:16,200 --> 02:03:17,280
We did win first!

3419
02:03:17,400 --> 02:03:18,100
I will concede.

3420
02:03:18,700 --> 02:03:21,500
For the sake of win- Okay, I won't bring out my machine gun.

3421
02:03:21,800 --> 02:03:22,020
I will, I promise.

3422
02:03:22,020 --> 02:03:24,860
Just don't bring it out every time.

3423
02:03:25,060 --> 02:03:26,740
You gotta limit yourself.

3424
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:28,680
You gotta know the scenario.

3425
02:03:29,060 --> 02:03:33,980
When they're like, you know, when they're all up in our face, then you bring the machine gun.

3426
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:36,660
That's what I did in the last one!

3427
02:03:36,720 --> 02:03:37,040
Okay.

3428
02:03:37,900 --> 02:03:40,120
Yeah, yeah, like the 1v1 thing.

3429
02:03:40,200 --> 02:03:41,440
I was like, okay, okay.

3430
02:03:42,220 --> 02:03:43,640
There's no reload in here.

3431
02:03:43,680 --> 02:03:45,500
So, yeah, it's great.

3432
02:03:45,720 --> 02:03:47,420
See, situational awareness!

3433
02:03:48,060 --> 02:03:48,980
My brain's growing!

3434
02:03:49,180 --> 02:03:49,620
Oh, shit!

3435
02:03:49,900 --> 02:03:50,160
Headcrack!

3436
02:03:50,500 --> 02:03:51,820
Oh, that was a good shot.

3437
02:03:51,980 --> 02:03:52,980
That was a really good shot.

3438
02:03:53,160 --> 02:03:54,400
Yeah, headshot too!

3439
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:55,940
From that far off!

3440
02:03:55,960 --> 02:03:58,900
That was- That damage was basically...

3441
02:04:00,260 --> 02:04:01,420
Okay, I shouldn't- What?

3442
02:04:01,520 --> 02:04:01,780
What?

3443
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:02,140
What?

3444
02:04:02,180 --> 02:04:03,420
What are you guys saying?

3445
02:04:03,780 --> 02:04:05,920
That was 102 damage.

3446
02:04:09,080 --> 02:04:09,520
So...

3447
02:04:11,780 --> 02:04:13,660
I don't think you're gonna say something nice.

3448
02:04:13,660 --> 02:04:14,400
What she made in that one shot...

3449
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:15,440
I said I knew it!

3450
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:17,380
I knew we were gonna say that!

3451
02:04:18,160 --> 02:04:19,420
I fucking knew it!

3452
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:23,020
I fucking knew it.

3453
02:04:23,260 --> 02:04:24,380
I had a hunch.

3454
02:04:24,500 --> 02:04:25,500
Thanks for being on my team.

3455
02:04:27,320 --> 02:04:28,560
You're welcome, you're welcome.

3456
02:04:28,680 --> 02:04:29,300
Anytime, anytime.

3457
02:04:33,260 --> 02:04:34,160
No, it's an honor.

3458
02:04:34,340 --> 02:04:35,240
I drove this.

3459
02:04:35,540 --> 02:04:36,940
Yeah, we- I mean, we won!

3460
02:04:37,180 --> 02:04:37,820
We won first.

3461
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:38,640
Yeah, we won!

3462
02:04:38,780 --> 02:04:39,640
Yeah, we won!

3463
02:04:39,640 --> 02:04:43,880
Top 4 from that last game is already more than enough.

3464
02:04:44,120 --> 02:04:44,980
More than what I expected.

3465
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:45,720
Yeah, more than enough.

3466
02:04:47,120 --> 02:04:50,700
I think this will top most of my memories here in Hall of Stars.

3467
02:04:50,740 --> 02:04:54,180
But you're- In 20 years, you're just gonna think about- I think this is the most memorable one so far.

3468
02:04:54,260 --> 02:04:56,360
In 20 years, you're gonna think back to this game.

3469
02:04:56,580 --> 02:04:56,840
Yeah?

3470
02:04:58,520 --> 02:05:01,740
Remember that one time when I actually won at something in Apex?

3471
02:05:02,020 --> 02:05:03,100
Yeah, this is it.

3472
02:05:03,720 --> 02:05:06,280
You get flexed to your- Like 80 years old and I'm still thinking about it.

3473
02:05:06,300 --> 02:05:10,440
You get flexed to your armist members and be like, I won a game!

3474
02:05:11,440 --> 02:05:12,440
I won a game.

3475
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:13,920
You guys were dragging me down!

3476
02:05:14,180 --> 02:05:14,940
That's what!

3477
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:16,480
You fucking know it!

3478
02:05:16,720 --> 02:05:18,060
You guys are a bunch of failures!

3479
02:05:18,580 --> 02:05:20,120
I could do shit alone!

3480
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:23,180
Hey, you see- Oh my god!

3481
02:05:23,180 --> 02:05:23,980
Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck!

3482
02:05:24,680 --> 02:05:25,160
Ayyy!

3483
02:05:25,740 --> 02:05:26,720
She lost though.

3484
02:05:27,980 --> 02:05:29,040
That was nice!

3485
02:05:29,340 --> 02:05:32,120
Okay, but like, this rampart we're watching?

3486
02:05:32,380 --> 02:05:34,180
She didn't bring her minigun out.

3487
02:05:34,600 --> 02:05:38,820
The rampart that died brought her minigun out and she died.

3488
02:05:39,480 --> 02:05:40,660
Okay, now, okay, okay.

3489
02:05:40,700 --> 02:05:41,240
That was me.

3490
02:05:41,360 --> 02:05:43,660
That would have been me in alternate reality.

3491
02:05:47,080 --> 02:05:48,320
I'm learning, I'm learning.

3492
02:05:48,820 --> 02:05:50,700
See, see, see, this is good body review.

3493
02:05:50,840 --> 02:05:52,140
This is a really good body review.

3494
02:05:52,300 --> 02:05:53,160
You're getting better.

3495
02:05:53,220 --> 02:05:54,140
Yeah, I'm actually learning.

3496
02:05:54,260 --> 02:05:55,580
It's like watching YouTube videos.

3497
02:05:55,700 --> 02:05:56,920
Or like, uh, yeah.

3498
02:05:57,400 --> 02:05:57,920
It's like I'm watching a stream.

3499
02:05:57,920 --> 02:06:00,200
It's like people watch Apex streamers to get better.

3500
02:06:02,040 --> 02:06:02,440
Whoa!

3501
02:06:02,480 --> 02:06:04,720
Yeah, I will usually watch.

3502
02:06:04,740 --> 02:06:05,200
It's Timmy.

3503
02:06:05,300 --> 02:06:06,060
Is It's Timmy here?

3504
02:06:06,140 --> 02:06:06,600
It's Timmy.

3505
02:06:06,720 --> 02:06:08,340
Uh, oh, sorry.

3506
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:10,560
No, he's addicted to Marvel Rivals.

3507
02:06:12,500 --> 02:06:13,120
Oh, yeah.

3508
02:06:13,120 --> 02:06:13,560
Oh, whoa!

3509
02:06:13,940 --> 02:06:14,720
Oh, this team.

3510
02:06:15,180 --> 02:06:15,920
Oh, no, there's a rodent!

3511
02:06:16,160 --> 02:06:16,700
Oh, God!

3512
02:06:16,720 --> 02:06:18,620
Oh, yeah, goodbye.

3513
02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:20,800
And they got top ten though.

3514
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:21,440
Oh.

3515
02:06:21,780 --> 02:06:22,840
Top ten is pretty good.

3516
02:06:22,980 --> 02:06:23,120
Nice.

3517
02:06:23,120 --> 02:06:24,160
They got points for that.

3518
02:06:24,520 --> 02:06:25,400
Do they have another...

3519
02:06:25,400 --> 02:06:26,840
Oh, they have another rampart.

3520
02:06:26,900 --> 02:06:27,420
What the fuck?

3521
02:06:28,860 --> 02:06:29,520
It is the meta.

3522
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:31,040
No, everybody's running rampart.

3523
02:06:31,900 --> 02:06:32,880
Well, they ran Valk.

3524
02:06:33,320 --> 02:06:33,920
That's interesting.

3525
02:06:35,720 --> 02:06:37,360
I didn't know if Valk was still good.

3526
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:38,540
Oh, my God, this team.

3527
02:06:38,540 --> 02:06:39,600
Yo, they're behind a door!

3528
02:06:39,880 --> 02:06:41,340
No, this new castle is locked in.

3529
02:06:41,580 --> 02:06:47,560
Oh, my God, it's so funny.

3530
02:06:48,220 --> 02:06:49,160
Oh, my God.

3531
02:06:49,240 --> 02:06:50,420
No, that's Sakura.

3532
02:06:52,480 --> 02:06:53,340
Oh, my God.

3533
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:54,120
It's so chaotic.

3534
02:06:54,740 --> 02:06:55,460
Are they still in...

3535
02:06:55,460 --> 02:06:56,300
Yeah, there's...

3536
02:06:56,300 --> 02:06:59,300
They're barely outside, barely inside a ring.

3537
02:07:01,100 --> 02:07:01,880
Oh, my God.

3538
02:07:02,580 --> 02:07:04,860
Flame, have you ever played in these JP tournaments before?

3539
02:07:08,120 --> 02:07:09,880
Oh, I think he left.

3540
02:07:10,060 --> 02:07:11,280
I think he left us.

3541
02:07:11,380 --> 02:07:11,740
Oh, no!

3542
02:07:12,340 --> 02:07:14,840
You mean like a VTuber one?

3543
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:16,700
Yeah, yeah, these...

3544
02:07:16,700 --> 02:07:18,000
No, this is my first one.

3545
02:07:18,060 --> 02:07:18,940
Your first one?

3546
02:07:19,400 --> 02:07:20,040
What do you think?

3547
02:07:20,040 --> 02:07:23,340
This is like a Manday game or something.

3548
02:07:23,720 --> 02:07:24,360
Oh, yeah, yeah, I was there.

3549
02:07:25,140 --> 02:07:28,320
Yeah, I think there were VTubers in that one, but it's not a Japanese one, right?

3550
02:07:29,360 --> 02:07:32,240
Yeah, yeah, no, that one was more like casual.

3551
02:07:32,680 --> 02:07:34,840
Because that one was like non-Apex VTubers.

3552
02:07:34,840 --> 02:07:36,460
We're participating in it.

3553
02:07:36,460 --> 02:07:39,360
But this one is like majority are like...

3554
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:40,760
They play Apex.

3555
02:07:41,860 --> 02:07:42,920
Because it's like...

3556
02:07:42,920 --> 02:07:44,120
Except for my teammates.

3557
02:07:44,700 --> 02:07:44,900
Oh, yeah.

3558
02:07:47,940 --> 02:07:50,220
Did you have two pros on your team?

3559
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:54,920
Yeah, our third, like, didn't show up.

3560
02:07:55,260 --> 02:07:55,900
So they...

3561
02:07:57,620 --> 02:07:58,960
Yes, empty.

3562
02:07:59,460 --> 02:08:00,580
Yeah, I was like, the fuck?

3563
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:01,700
I was like, I saw that.

3564
02:08:01,820 --> 02:08:02,820
I was like, this is bullshit.

3565
02:08:02,820 --> 02:08:05,400
Your VTuber literally didn't show up.

3566
02:08:06,060 --> 02:08:07,060
Wait, really?

3567
02:08:07,260 --> 02:08:10,200
Yeah, there was a...

3568
02:08:10,200 --> 02:08:10,740
There was a...

3569
02:08:10,740 --> 02:08:16,260
Not my custom, Jared, but like there was a different custom that was like VTuber, content creator and pro player.

3570
02:08:16,460 --> 02:08:19,100
And then like their VTuber didn't show up.

3571
02:08:19,180 --> 02:08:21,480
So their team was literally just an Apex team.

3572
02:08:24,580 --> 02:08:27,560
And there was money involved, too.

3573
02:08:29,100 --> 02:08:31,520
No, listen, listen.

3574
02:08:31,520 --> 02:08:32,900
I had a...

3575
02:08:32,900 --> 02:08:35,120
I had a restriction imposed on me.

3576
02:08:35,180 --> 02:08:36,000
I could only use one gun.

3577
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,180
Yeah, you had only one gun.

3578
02:08:37,680 --> 02:08:38,480
Oh, no.

3579
02:08:39,720 --> 02:08:40,960
Forgot about that.

3580
02:08:41,880 --> 02:08:42,880
No, this is a different...

3581
02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:43,800
This one was a different...

3582
02:08:43,800 --> 02:08:45,220
It's not my custom, Jared.

3583
02:08:45,600 --> 02:08:47,380
It's a different one.

3584
02:08:47,680 --> 02:08:49,980
Because every team still had a VTuber.

3585
02:08:50,660 --> 02:08:51,220
They didn't.

3586
02:08:51,500 --> 02:08:52,200
Oh, OK, OK, OK.

3587
02:08:54,360 --> 02:08:56,060
Yeah, I was like, holy fuck.

3588
02:08:56,140 --> 02:08:57,340
I can't believe this team...

3589
02:08:57,340 --> 02:09:01,160
I remember because I was like, why does this team have empty and flame?

3590
02:09:01,160 --> 02:09:01,720
I was like...

3591
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:05,200
No, I think that was fair.

3592
02:09:05,400 --> 02:09:06,200
I think that was fair.

3593
02:09:06,460 --> 02:09:07,580
Oh, yeah, it was...

3594
02:09:07,580 --> 02:09:11,960
Bro, Apex team had like Chibidoki and Nags.

3595
02:09:12,020 --> 02:09:13,320
What the fuck do you mean?

3596
02:09:14,860 --> 02:09:17,040
Like, what the fuck do you mean?

3597
02:09:17,320 --> 02:09:19,420
They play Apex, but they're not at like...

3598
02:09:19,420 --> 02:09:20,280
OK, listen, listen.

3599
02:09:20,660 --> 02:09:22,900
Listen, you're like complaining about my team.

3600
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:24,800
But did you see Phony's team?

3601
02:09:24,980 --> 02:09:25,760
What was Phony's team?

3602
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:26,220
And Zero's team?

3603
02:09:26,820 --> 02:09:27,160
What was...

3604
02:09:27,160 --> 02:09:29,400
Oh, wait, Zero's team was actual full Apex players, too.

3605
02:09:29,460 --> 02:09:30,060
No, they're...

3606
02:09:30,060 --> 02:09:30,940
Yeah, yeah, look.

3607
02:09:30,940 --> 02:09:33,400
JPeebs is a dip, but he was doing OK.

3608
02:09:33,800 --> 02:09:35,220
And Eliyup was cooking.

3609
02:09:35,740 --> 02:09:36,620
Eliyup was so good.

3610
02:09:36,680 --> 02:09:37,740
How does that balance out?

3611
02:09:38,260 --> 02:09:39,220
She's like a Phony.

3612
02:09:39,280 --> 02:09:40,120
She was a full...

3613
02:09:40,120 --> 02:09:42,520
Yeah, yeah, she's a full Apex player.

3614
02:09:42,520 --> 02:09:45,560
Hey, Phony was playing with Stormin and like an X-Pro.

3615
02:09:45,800 --> 02:09:48,960
I forgot which one exactly, but he was playing with Stormin and an X-Pro.

3616
02:09:49,180 --> 02:09:50,820
And ours, it just is.

3617
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:51,400
Yeah.

3618
02:09:52,100 --> 02:09:59,100
OK, to be fair, that custom, like, I think 50% dropped out in less than a minute.

3619
02:10:00,980 --> 02:10:05,400
Literally, they were grabbing people on the last hour.

3620
02:10:05,940 --> 02:10:06,720
Oh, God.

3621
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:07,900
Yeah, it was Mandy's custom.

3622
02:10:09,060 --> 02:10:16,600
I know, like, they were asking so many random people if they wanted to join the custom because so many people dropped out last minute.

3623
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:20,440
Just random people just looking for more because everyone just dropped out.

3624
02:10:20,440 --> 02:10:20,620
Yeah.

3625
02:10:20,940 --> 02:10:21,260
Jesus Christ.

3626
02:10:28,170 --> 02:10:29,270
OK, so...

3627
02:10:29,270 --> 02:10:29,910
That's crazy.

3628
02:10:30,070 --> 02:10:30,230
All right.

3629
02:10:30,290 --> 02:10:31,070
What map is this?

3630
02:10:31,350 --> 02:10:31,770
What map is this?

3631
02:10:31,770 --> 02:10:32,710
It's still World's Edge.

3632
02:10:32,710 --> 02:10:36,090
We never change maps when we're still there.

3633
02:10:36,710 --> 02:10:37,730
Yeah, OK, OK, OK.

3634
02:10:37,790 --> 02:10:39,070
All right, all right, all right, all right.

3635
02:10:39,430 --> 02:10:42,370
A video just came on my feed.

3636
02:10:42,810 --> 02:10:46,610
Apparently, someone did 52 kills solo.

3637
02:10:47,530 --> 02:10:47,950
What?

3638
02:10:49,070 --> 02:10:50,010
In this?

3639
02:10:51,970 --> 02:10:53,150
In Apex, yeah.

3640
02:10:53,150 --> 02:10:54,750
OK, so there's two things.

3641
02:10:55,050 --> 02:10:56,050
He was on console.

3642
02:10:56,790 --> 02:11:00,650
He 3-stacked with a Lifeline and a Newcastle and they were dropping him armors and...

3643
02:11:03,630 --> 02:11:08,170
And I think the third most important part, I think he's literally cheating.

3644
02:11:08,530 --> 02:11:10,450
He's using like some sort of recall script.

3645
02:11:10,710 --> 02:11:12,670
It does not move at all.

3646
02:11:12,810 --> 02:11:13,270
Nice.

3647
02:11:13,270 --> 02:11:13,850
It's disgusting.

3648
02:11:14,850 --> 02:11:16,650
They could be in a bot lobby.

3649
02:11:18,470 --> 02:11:19,910
They could have glitches.

3650
02:11:20,570 --> 02:11:21,030
It's a...

3651
02:11:22,050 --> 02:11:23,210
Oh, it's a different one.

3652
02:11:23,410 --> 02:11:23,530
Lobby.

3653
02:11:23,730 --> 02:11:25,170
Oh, it's a ranked lobby.

3654
02:11:25,510 --> 02:11:26,170
It's in ranked.

3655
02:11:26,490 --> 02:11:28,030
Yeah, it's in a ranked lobby.

3656
02:11:28,410 --> 02:11:29,410
Oh, it's...

3657
02:11:29,410 --> 02:11:29,770
Oh, man.

3658
02:11:29,790 --> 02:11:31,910
It is like flat at the end of the season.

3659
02:11:31,910 --> 02:11:33,610
So it's like it is really bad.

3660
02:11:33,650 --> 02:11:35,030
But 52 kills.

3661
02:11:35,170 --> 02:11:35,890
That's crazy.

3662
02:11:35,930 --> 02:11:37,510
I didn't even know that was possible.

3663
02:11:37,670 --> 02:11:37,730
Yeah.

3664
02:11:37,750 --> 02:11:39,510
Isn't there like 60 people in the lobby?

3665
02:11:41,490 --> 02:11:42,050
Yeah.

3666
02:11:42,810 --> 02:11:43,190
Yeah.

3667
02:11:43,190 --> 02:11:48,590
I think even if he is using like recall scripts, 52s.

3668
02:11:48,950 --> 02:11:50,050
That's an insane jump.

3669
02:11:50,310 --> 02:11:53,990
Did everybody just drop fucking like near him?

3670
02:11:55,550 --> 02:11:56,930
In his surroundings?

3671
02:11:57,090 --> 02:11:57,550
No, I don't.

3672
02:11:57,750 --> 02:11:59,850
I think nobody, just nobody fought.

3673
02:11:59,850 --> 02:12:00,590
Nobody fought.

3674
02:12:00,590 --> 02:12:02,770
Nobody can ricochet to every single one of them.

3675
02:12:03,070 --> 02:12:03,970
Nobody fought.

3676
02:12:04,070 --> 02:12:05,070
Everyone just fought him.

3677
02:12:05,330 --> 02:12:05,810
Everybody...

3678
02:12:05,810 --> 02:12:06,950
I guess it's like...

3679
02:12:06,950 --> 02:12:08,370
It's like...

3680
02:12:08,370 --> 02:12:10,890
In ranked, everyone does just run away and craft, you know?

3681
02:12:10,890 --> 02:12:11,070
Yeah.

3682
02:12:11,290 --> 02:12:12,750
It reminded me of like...

3683
02:12:12,750 --> 02:12:13,750
52 kills, I think that was like...

3684
02:12:14,450 --> 02:12:21,150
It reminded me of when like Apex didn't have a custom lobby and scrims were just...

3685
02:12:21,150 --> 02:12:25,430
Were just gotta be like 3, 2, 1 and then queue up and quit.

3686
02:12:26,570 --> 02:12:27,110
That's what...

3687
02:12:27,110 --> 02:12:27,470
Oh, my god.

3688
02:12:27,470 --> 02:12:28,570
Yeah, that's how they...

3689
02:12:28,570 --> 02:12:29,830
That's how they do scrims.

3690
02:12:30,350 --> 02:12:31,530
Like they literally...

3691
02:12:31,530 --> 02:12:33,390
There was no way to have custom lobbies.

3692
02:12:33,470 --> 02:12:35,550
So everybody was like 3, 2, 1, queue.

3693
02:12:35,670 --> 02:12:36,910
Was this like season zero?

3694
02:12:37,110 --> 02:12:37,370
Yeah.

3695
02:12:38,030 --> 02:12:39,750
Do you know how I knew about that?

3696
02:12:40,190 --> 02:12:42,230
I accidentally got into a scrim.

3697
02:12:43,330 --> 02:12:43,770
No!

3698
02:12:44,730 --> 02:12:46,790
And you were just like 3, 2, 1...

3699
02:12:46,790 --> 02:12:47,810
No, it was back...

3700
02:12:47,810 --> 02:12:49,490
No, I literally was just queuing...

3701
02:12:49,490 --> 02:12:51,190
Queuing quick play with a friend.

3702
02:12:51,410 --> 02:12:53,390
And then we were so confused because we were like...

3703
02:12:53,390 --> 02:12:54,730
Why isn't anybody fighting?

3704
02:12:55,030 --> 02:12:56,130
Like we were so...

3705
02:12:56,130 --> 02:12:57,530
And then...

3706
02:12:57,530 --> 02:13:02,730
And it was back when Aceu was still in the team.

3707
02:13:03,030 --> 02:13:04,710
So that was how long it was.

3708
02:13:04,790 --> 02:13:06,150
It was when Aceu was still playing.

3709
02:13:06,810 --> 02:13:08,130
I remember what team he was on.

3710
02:13:08,770 --> 02:13:12,230
And then we were like, where is everybody?

3711
02:13:12,670 --> 02:13:15,150
So we locked ourselves in the house because we were so confused.

3712
02:13:15,530 --> 02:13:18,290
Because literally first ring close, no one was dead.

3713
02:13:18,910 --> 02:13:25,150
And then we saw the names and we're like, wait, aren't those pro players?

3714
02:13:27,790 --> 02:13:29,430
We're like, wait a minute.

3715
02:13:29,570 --> 02:13:31,050
Those are pro player names.

3716
02:13:31,270 --> 02:13:35,630
We're like, oh my god, we're in a fucking pro lobby.

3717
02:13:35,650 --> 02:13:40,870
But what are the odds though that you managed to like time it right exactly during the tournament?

3718
02:13:40,870 --> 02:13:41,570
Yeah, I know.

3719
02:13:42,030 --> 02:13:44,450
I think that was a calling for you.

3720
02:13:45,150 --> 02:13:48,950
I knew Aceu was in the lobby because we died to Aceu.

3721
02:13:49,730 --> 02:13:50,770
We were like...

3722
02:13:50,770 --> 02:13:53,030
It was back in like the original...

3723
02:13:53,030 --> 02:13:54,370
I don't remember what frag the city.

3724
02:13:54,370 --> 02:13:55,350
It was in the city.

3725
02:13:55,430 --> 02:13:57,850
And you know that door with the house with windows on it?

3726
02:13:58,030 --> 02:13:59,430
So we're just sitting in there.

3727
02:13:59,470 --> 02:14:03,910
And then we saw a team run up at us and we were just like sat looking at them outside the window.

3728
02:14:03,930 --> 02:14:05,750
And they were looking at us because...

3729
02:14:05,750 --> 02:14:07,630
And then they were like, what the fuck are they doing?

3730
02:14:10,650 --> 02:14:12,750
It's just like, what the fuck are they doing?

3731
02:14:12,750 --> 02:14:15,290
Just standing there in the house looking at us.

3732
02:14:17,550 --> 02:14:18,450
That is crazy.

3733
02:14:18,650 --> 02:14:19,630
So like...

3734
02:14:19,630 --> 02:14:20,890
Oh, Jarrod didn't get in again.

3735
02:14:20,910 --> 02:14:22,930
I don't feel lucky or unlucky with that.

3736
02:14:22,930 --> 02:14:24,930
Did you at least win?

3737
02:14:25,290 --> 02:14:26,950
You didn't get in.

3738
02:14:27,050 --> 02:14:28,470
We got to get you back in.

3739
02:14:29,050 --> 02:14:29,490
What?

3740
02:14:29,690 --> 02:14:30,670
I was just here.

3741
02:14:31,290 --> 02:14:33,990
Jarrod didn't get in again, I'm sorry.

3742
02:14:33,990 --> 02:14:34,270
I'm literally outside here.

3743
02:14:34,350 --> 02:14:34,870
The fuck?

3744
02:14:36,250 --> 02:14:38,150
Dude, look, look, look at my screen.

3745
02:14:38,330 --> 02:14:40,550
I'm literally just waiting for everyone.

3746
02:14:41,230 --> 02:14:41,670
What?

3747
02:14:43,870 --> 02:14:45,590
Oh my God, look, look.

3748
02:14:47,430 --> 02:14:49,710
I'm suddenly holding back everybody again.

3749
02:14:49,870 --> 02:14:50,990
Okay, wait, I think I'm in here.

3750
02:14:51,090 --> 02:14:51,790
I think I'm in here.

3751
02:14:52,090 --> 02:14:52,890
No, no, no.

3752
02:14:52,890 --> 02:14:54,250
We know you're not.

3753
02:14:54,250 --> 02:14:58,010
Oh, wait, wait, he got in, he got in, he got in.

3754
02:14:58,090 --> 02:14:59,990
Wait, wait, wait, I got in, I got in.

3755
02:15:00,190 --> 02:15:01,670
He just loaded in.

3756
02:15:03,110 --> 02:15:05,890
Oh, stop, stop, stop, guys, guys, don't cancel the match.

3757
02:15:05,910 --> 02:15:07,410
I think I might still restart anyways.

3758
02:15:08,090 --> 02:15:09,210
They've already said it.

3759
02:15:11,170 --> 02:15:13,110
Jarrod is in lava siphon.

3760
02:15:13,570 --> 02:15:14,310
Wait, what?

3761
02:15:15,070 --> 02:15:16,030
Yeah, I am.

3762
02:15:17,050 --> 02:15:18,570
No, no, he's in siphon.

3763
02:15:18,650 --> 02:15:19,310
Oh, what?

3764
02:15:21,210 --> 02:15:23,390
Okay, they separated me from all of you.

3765
02:15:23,430 --> 02:15:24,090
The fuck?

3766
02:15:25,510 --> 02:15:25,950
What?

3767
02:15:27,230 --> 02:15:28,650
This is insane.

3768
02:15:28,970 --> 02:15:29,950
I just got here.

3769
02:15:33,410 --> 02:15:35,030
Oh my God.

3770
02:15:38,630 --> 02:15:39,070
What?

3771
02:15:40,230 --> 02:15:40,650
What the?

3772
02:15:41,950 --> 02:15:46,150
Jarrod, did you not, did you, did you like not want to play with us that bad?

3773
02:15:46,970 --> 02:15:48,730
Bro, what are you doing over there, man?

3774
02:15:48,730 --> 02:15:50,350
I just got here.

3775
02:15:50,690 --> 02:15:51,750
What are you doing over there, bro?

3776
02:15:52,010 --> 02:15:53,010
Siphon, we need to siphon.

3777
02:15:53,410 --> 02:15:55,530
Dude, dude, I said it.

3778
02:15:57,290 --> 02:15:58,070
Oh my God.

3779
02:15:58,330 --> 02:15:59,350
You should say that in chat.

3780
02:16:00,130 --> 02:16:00,670
What the hell?

3781
02:16:01,750 --> 02:16:03,010
I didn't, I'm not rigging this.

3782
02:16:03,130 --> 02:16:04,290
I got this thing on fucking stream.

3783
02:16:04,290 --> 02:16:05,530
Okay, we don't say anything.

3784
02:16:05,710 --> 02:16:09,310
They won't know who, let's not, let's not say anything.

3785
02:16:09,630 --> 02:16:11,010
So they won't know it's our fault.

3786
02:16:11,570 --> 02:16:15,770
They won't, they won't, I'm in fucking siphon.

3787
02:16:15,770 --> 02:16:17,770
We literally got evidence of it on stream.

3788
02:16:18,310 --> 02:16:19,510
How much did you get?

3789
02:16:23,250 --> 02:16:24,170
Oh no.

3790
02:16:24,530 --> 02:16:25,930
Oh my God.

3791
02:16:31,150 --> 02:16:32,630
I don't know.

3792
02:16:33,690 --> 02:16:36,550
It always seems to happen every single tournament.

3793
02:16:36,810 --> 02:16:37,430
Okay, match starting.

3794
02:16:37,550 --> 02:16:38,530
Okay, I can see it starting.

3795
02:16:38,850 --> 02:16:39,490
There we go.

3796
02:16:39,770 --> 02:16:40,370
We're starting.

3797
02:16:40,910 --> 02:16:42,170
We don't say anything.

3798
02:16:42,370 --> 02:16:43,910
They won't know it's our fault.

3799
02:16:45,010 --> 02:16:45,450
Yeah, yeah.

3800
02:16:46,050 --> 02:16:48,510
Okay, we're just going to shut up about it.

3801
02:16:48,510 --> 02:16:49,550
No one's going to know.

3802
02:16:51,110 --> 02:16:52,830
This is between all of us.

3803
02:16:54,250 --> 02:16:55,290
Thank you again.

3804
02:16:55,790 --> 02:17:01,330
We don't know how he got to, don't know how he spawned in siphon.

3805
02:17:02,550 --> 02:17:06,110
Oh, most players respond at invalid POIs.

3806
02:17:06,910 --> 02:17:07,970
Oh no.

3807
02:17:08,190 --> 02:17:09,710
I didn't know that was a thing.

3808
02:17:11,690 --> 02:17:13,030
So see, it wasn't our fault.

3809
02:17:13,190 --> 02:17:13,690
It wasn't our fault.

3810
02:17:13,710 --> 02:17:14,750
That's crazy.

3811
02:17:16,230 --> 02:17:17,810
He just didn't want to play with us anyway.

3812
02:17:18,510 --> 02:17:21,010
He wanted to join a different team.

3813
02:17:22,130 --> 02:17:23,530
No, that was not me.

3814
02:17:23,670 --> 02:17:24,310
Okay, fine.

3815
02:17:24,430 --> 02:17:24,590
Fine.

3816
02:17:24,730 --> 02:17:24,910
Whatever.

3817
02:17:25,230 --> 02:17:26,290
Okay, you bullied him too much.

3818
02:17:26,710 --> 02:17:27,610
Wait, me?

3819
02:17:27,870 --> 02:17:29,750
You were part of the problem too.

3820
02:17:30,250 --> 02:17:30,630
No, no.

3821
02:17:30,770 --> 02:17:32,510
You gave him a reality check.

3822
02:17:32,570 --> 02:17:33,590
Stop pointing the finger at me.

3823
02:17:34,350 --> 02:17:36,090
You gave him a reality check.

3824
02:17:36,390 --> 02:17:37,670
You're the one who started this, Doki.

3825
02:17:37,750 --> 02:17:38,510
He's just enabling.

3826
02:17:38,750 --> 02:17:40,590
Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3827
02:17:41,010 --> 02:17:45,290
Turat looked up to you and you gave him a reality check.

3828
02:17:46,770 --> 02:17:48,490
I mean, that was helpful advice.

3829
02:17:48,510 --> 02:17:49,510
Yours not.

3830
02:17:50,290 --> 02:17:51,230
There's a difference.

3831
02:17:51,630 --> 02:17:54,850
Well, you were not happy when he gave you that reality check.

3832
02:17:54,870 --> 02:17:55,710
I remember that.

3833
02:17:55,710 --> 02:17:56,310
No, I was happy.

3834
02:17:56,390 --> 02:17:57,050
I was happy.

3835
02:17:57,270 --> 02:18:00,990
When you start saying shit from your mouth, I don't appreciate that at all.

3836
02:18:01,050 --> 02:18:03,550
You just hear my voice and you're like, I'm not happy.

3837
02:18:04,130 --> 02:18:06,270
My criticism comes from a good place, right?

3838
02:18:06,530 --> 02:18:07,150
Doki's just...

3839
02:18:07,150 --> 02:18:07,930
Wait, I just want you to talk to me.

3840
02:18:08,830 --> 02:18:10,910
My criticism comes from a good place, right?

3841
02:18:11,110 --> 02:18:14,350
Doki's comes from like, just a very negative, like...

3842
02:18:14,350 --> 02:18:15,250
Yeah, that's right.

3843
02:18:15,390 --> 02:18:16,630
He just wants to put you down, you know?

3844
02:18:17,210 --> 02:18:18,410
I would never do that to you.

3845
02:18:18,510 --> 02:18:19,990
No, but I do it for content.

3846
02:18:20,030 --> 02:18:20,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I believe in flame.

3847
02:18:20,930 --> 02:18:21,370
Droid, droid, droid.

3848
02:18:21,610 --> 02:18:22,730
But I do it for content.

3849
02:18:23,090 --> 02:18:24,690
Like, that comes from a good place.

3850
02:18:24,770 --> 02:18:25,970
That's just unbelievable.

3851
02:18:26,310 --> 02:18:26,790
That's unbelievable.

3852
02:18:27,150 --> 02:18:30,450
That is just an admission of guilt on the highest level.

3853
02:18:30,610 --> 02:18:31,310
See, I knew it.

3854
02:18:31,430 --> 02:18:34,110
Like, she sacrificed your well-being for a content.

3855
02:18:34,670 --> 02:18:35,330
My mental health?

3856
02:18:35,370 --> 02:18:36,650
Unreal, unreal, unreal.

3857
02:18:37,450 --> 02:18:38,570
I'd never do this to you, Droid.

3858
02:18:38,590 --> 02:18:40,910
But Droid, you're sacrificing your mental health for clips.

3859
02:18:41,610 --> 02:18:43,310
Oh yeah, you're right, you're right, you're right.

3860
02:18:43,510 --> 02:18:44,710
Clip farming, clip farming, you're right.

3861
02:18:44,710 --> 02:18:45,270
You're clip farming.

3862
02:18:46,210 --> 02:18:47,790
Yeah, that's right, that's right, that's right.

3863
02:18:48,510 --> 02:18:49,390
You got me on that one.

3864
02:18:49,450 --> 02:18:52,630
Yeah, see, there you are, as if you don't want to get a clip farm.

3865
02:18:52,810 --> 02:18:53,450
Don't fucking lie to me.

3866
02:18:53,470 --> 02:18:56,010
Be a little nicer to me, please.

3867
02:18:56,570 --> 02:18:58,690
You know you want to get clip farm.

3868
02:18:58,810 --> 02:18:59,990
Don't fucking lie to me.

3869
02:19:01,090 --> 02:19:01,590
Oh, you're right.

3870
02:19:01,650 --> 02:19:02,510
You know my grind.

3871
02:19:03,610 --> 02:19:05,870
You just, you gotta watch your back, Doki.

3872
02:19:05,870 --> 02:19:08,930
I'm gonna come out with a bit longer of my experience with Doki Bird.

3873
02:19:09,730 --> 02:19:11,770
Which was all lies, by the way.

3874
02:19:11,770 --> 02:19:13,590
Doki Bird, my experience.

3875
02:19:14,450 --> 02:19:17,750
My experience, not if I come out with it first.

3876
02:19:18,190 --> 02:19:19,350
Oh, shit.

3877
02:19:20,310 --> 02:19:21,890
Nah, that's just landing.

3878
02:19:21,950 --> 02:19:23,570
We have that on tape, blackmail.

3879
02:19:26,330 --> 02:19:27,990
Mutual assured destruction.

3880
02:19:30,870 --> 02:19:31,870
My favorite.

3881
02:19:32,610 --> 02:19:36,050
I need, like, an actual gun.

3882
02:19:36,770 --> 02:19:37,790
I have a headlock.

3883
02:19:37,790 --> 02:19:38,830
I don't have anything here.

3884
02:19:38,910 --> 02:19:39,850
Do you want a Prowler?

3885
02:19:39,970 --> 02:19:40,750
That's all I got.

3886
02:19:41,150 --> 02:19:42,610
No, no, absolutely not.

3887
02:19:43,150 --> 02:19:43,790
I have a 3x.

3888
02:19:44,070 --> 02:19:45,490
I don't see anybody there yet.

3889
02:19:45,590 --> 02:19:47,130
I want a headscan near a monument.

3890
02:19:47,750 --> 02:19:50,570
Yeah, I'm heading over there now, but I don't see anybody on it.

3891
02:19:51,830 --> 02:19:53,170
I don't know if they scanned already.

3892
02:19:56,610 --> 02:19:57,670
Should we go, or no?

3893
02:19:58,270 --> 02:19:59,110
Yeah, you can go.

3894
02:19:59,410 --> 02:20:00,230
Okay, I need to wait for...

3895
02:20:01,330 --> 02:20:02,670
I'm just following Flame.

3896
02:20:02,930 --> 02:20:03,770
Gonna go on his way.

3897
02:20:03,790 --> 02:20:04,550
No, no, no, no, no.

3898
02:20:04,610 --> 02:20:05,450
Go, go towards...

3899
02:20:05,450 --> 02:20:06,710
No, no, no, go to me, and then...

3900
02:20:06,710 --> 02:20:07,690
That's the same thing we've done.

3901
02:20:07,950 --> 02:20:08,510
I just need...

3902
02:20:08,510 --> 02:20:09,650
There's a, uh...

3903
02:20:09,650 --> 02:20:11,290
Someone needs to hit the blue bin up here.

3904
02:20:12,990 --> 02:20:13,310
Um...

3905
02:20:13,990 --> 02:20:14,490
Okay, okay, okay.

3906
02:20:14,490 --> 02:20:15,030
I can get it.

3907
02:20:15,050 --> 02:20:15,490
I can get it.

3908
02:20:15,490 --> 02:20:16,030
I can get it.

3909
02:20:16,790 --> 02:20:18,550
Uh, they redeploy, they redeploy.

3910
02:20:19,110 --> 02:20:19,830
Yeah, that's good.

3911
02:20:20,450 --> 02:20:21,950
We can just run straight at them.

3912
02:20:22,730 --> 02:20:22,990
Okay.

3913
02:20:23,710 --> 02:20:24,470
All right, let's go.

3914
02:20:25,690 --> 02:20:27,410
They're flying, and they're fighting through the choke.

3915
02:20:28,370 --> 02:20:28,530
Yeah.

3916
02:20:28,950 --> 02:20:30,030
All right, Jiraiya, come, come, come, come, come.

3917
02:20:30,090 --> 02:20:30,970
I'm gonna do a bubble for you.

3918
02:20:31,130 --> 02:20:31,750
Coming, coming, coming.

3919
02:20:40,690 --> 02:20:42,490
Uh, I'm gonna get the cache while I...

3920
02:20:42,490 --> 02:20:43,690
I'm waiting for it, Jiraiya.

3921
02:20:44,210 --> 02:20:44,470
Wait!

3922
02:20:44,770 --> 02:20:45,450
Oh, that's you, okay.

3923
02:20:45,470 --> 02:20:46,170
They're coming on us, flying on us!

3924
02:20:46,310 --> 02:20:47,070
In the open, Pathfinder!

3925
02:20:48,110 --> 02:20:48,430
Come here.

3926
02:20:49,690 --> 02:20:50,670
I think we just fight this first.

3927
02:20:51,490 --> 02:20:51,730
Okay.

3928
02:20:52,870 --> 02:20:54,350
Is there a last game, though, Flame?

3929
02:20:54,350 --> 02:20:54,690
Are you sure?

3930
02:20:55,910 --> 02:20:57,710
Uh, yeah, he's just really close.

3931
02:20:57,850 --> 02:20:58,970
I don't know where he's going, though.

3932
02:20:59,010 --> 02:20:59,530
Oh, he ran him off.

3933
02:20:59,810 --> 02:21:00,230
I'm gonna get the...

3934
02:21:00,230 --> 02:21:01,190
Oh, he's gone, he's gone.

3935
02:21:01,290 --> 02:21:02,470
He's... you can... you can scan, you can scan.

3936
02:21:02,470 --> 02:21:03,770
Okay, I'm gonna get the cache.

3937
02:21:05,590 --> 02:21:07,650
Uh, just go back, Jiraiya, and scan this.

3938
02:21:07,770 --> 02:21:09,710
Yeah, Jiraiya, go back to the... go back here, go back here.

3939
02:21:09,970 --> 02:21:10,270
Look at this.

3940
02:21:10,890 --> 02:21:12,810
I'm gonna go up top and look for you guys.

3941
02:21:12,930 --> 02:21:13,870
You guys just hit scan.

3942
02:21:14,430 --> 02:21:15,050
Jiraiya, are you here?

3943
02:21:15,770 --> 02:21:16,090
Yep, yep.

3944
02:21:16,350 --> 02:21:17,050
I'm waiting, I'm waiting.

3945
02:21:17,090 --> 02:21:18,710
I don't want to waste my cooldown here.

3946
02:21:20,830 --> 02:21:22,030
I need a scope here, guys.

3947
02:21:22,150 --> 02:21:23,430
I have a 1x on my mouse.

3948
02:21:23,910 --> 02:21:25,290
I have a colo, that's it.

3949
02:21:25,950 --> 02:21:26,190
Yeah.

3950
02:21:28,230 --> 02:21:28,550
Oh!

3951
02:21:28,550 --> 02:21:29,190
Okay, he's really close.

3952
02:21:29,370 --> 02:21:29,430
Oh, Jonas.

3953
02:21:30,170 --> 02:21:30,490
Okay.

3954
02:21:31,070 --> 02:21:31,750
Where should we go?

3955
02:21:33,570 --> 02:21:33,890
I'm...

3956
02:21:34,530 --> 02:21:37,870
If we can be in one of these chokes, that'd be really good, but I don't think we can.

3957
02:21:37,870 --> 02:21:39,430
I don't know if we can cross it at this time.

3958
02:21:39,930 --> 02:21:40,250
Anymore?

3959
02:21:40,330 --> 02:21:43,270
Yeah, just... just come over, like, to the left side of Fragment here.

3960
02:21:43,350 --> 02:21:46,210
We might have to play underneath the bridge on my ping.

3961
02:21:46,410 --> 02:21:46,670
Okay.

3962
02:21:46,790 --> 02:21:47,190
But we'll see.

3963
02:21:47,290 --> 02:21:47,970
Just come up.

3964
02:21:50,650 --> 02:21:53,470
All right, I'm gonna wait for Dryad a little bit.

3965
02:21:53,990 --> 02:21:55,550
Okay, here I am.

3966
02:21:58,900 --> 02:22:00,760
Yeah, I think it's buff taken already.

3967
02:22:01,020 --> 02:22:03,620
Just, uh, come up this way first.

3968
02:22:03,900 --> 02:22:03,940
All right.

3969
02:22:04,080 --> 02:22:08,120
We need to be really careful because I think Epicenter Overlook could be on us here.

3970
02:22:08,240 --> 02:22:09,560
All right, I'm with you.

3971
02:22:10,960 --> 02:22:11,440
I'm...

3972
02:22:13,160 --> 02:22:14,120
Following through.

3973
02:22:16,900 --> 02:22:17,380
Battery...

3974
02:22:17,920 --> 02:22:18,400
Okay.

3975
02:22:18,780 --> 02:22:19,740
Don't need that.

3976
02:22:21,780 --> 02:22:23,380
I think we just go in the geyser here.

3977
02:22:23,500 --> 02:22:24,760
I have, uh, a vault key.

3978
02:22:25,860 --> 02:22:29,060
Uh, are we safe to rotate with Overlook in?

3979
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:30,980
Uh, I think we should be okay.

3980
02:22:31,080 --> 02:22:32,200
I think Overlook's rotated out.

3981
02:22:33,560 --> 02:22:33,920
Okay.

3982
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:39,120
We want to get the Respawn Beacon here and just look around, make sure we're actually safe first.

3983
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:39,860
Uh-oh.

3984
02:22:41,300 --> 02:22:41,660
Sniper.

3985
02:22:42,700 --> 02:22:43,060
Sniper?

3986
02:22:43,360 --> 02:22:43,680
Where?

3987
02:22:44,620 --> 02:22:45,160
It's probably...

3988
02:22:45,160 --> 02:22:46,920
Oh no, I think it's just, like, uh, I heard it.

3989
02:22:46,940 --> 02:22:47,200
Okay.

3990
02:22:47,260 --> 02:22:48,100
No one's shooting at me.

3991
02:22:49,540 --> 02:22:49,860
Oh!

3992
02:22:50,600 --> 02:22:51,420
Oh, there it is!

3993
02:22:51,480 --> 02:22:51,880
I got shot in.

3994
02:22:51,900 --> 02:22:52,500
Just come sit down.

3995
02:22:52,800 --> 02:22:53,200
I can work it.

3996
02:22:53,800 --> 02:22:54,160
It's fine.

3997
02:22:55,140 --> 02:22:56,520
I'm just gonna grab this and...

3998
02:22:57,500 --> 02:22:58,460
Let me know if you find light ammo.

3999
02:22:58,520 --> 02:23:00,500
I just grabbed the... I changed my loadout entirely.

4000
02:23:02,120 --> 02:23:02,440
Yep.

4001
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:04,260
All right, so I don't have a lot of ammo.

4002
02:23:10,540 --> 02:23:12,000
Also, Jared, you don't have to wait for me.

4003
02:23:12,040 --> 02:23:12,700
Just go for it.

4004
02:23:12,720 --> 02:23:15,080
If I'm looting something, just go for it.

4005
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:16,320
Okay.

4006
02:23:16,520 --> 02:23:16,880
All right.

4007
02:23:19,520 --> 02:23:20,160
So don't...

4008
02:23:20,160 --> 02:23:21,340
You don't loot, I loot.

4009
02:23:21,540 --> 02:23:22,360
You just go for it.

4010
02:23:25,060 --> 02:23:26,500
How many batteries do you have, Jared?

4011
02:23:27,460 --> 02:23:29,060
Uh, I have one.

4012
02:23:29,920 --> 02:23:31,600
Uh, I'm gonna drop you two here.

4013
02:23:32,740 --> 02:23:33,820
Okay, thank you.

4014
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:37,920
Uh, Doki, I think you hit this...

4015
02:23:37,920 --> 02:23:38,580
Thank you!

4016
02:23:38,580 --> 02:23:39,160
Hit this cache.

4017
02:23:40,340 --> 02:23:41,380
Thank you.

4018
02:23:41,760 --> 02:23:42,180
Thank you.

4019
02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:42,740
Okay.

4020
02:23:43,340 --> 02:23:45,560
Uh, get the... get the small bubble.

4021
02:23:46,800 --> 02:23:47,700
The small bubble?

4022
02:23:48,380 --> 02:23:50,340
Reduce tackle size and cooldown, baby bubble?

4023
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:51,840
Okay.

4024
02:23:55,760 --> 02:23:56,860
Oh, on us, on us, on us!

4025
02:23:57,340 --> 02:23:58,180
All right, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

4026
02:23:58,280 --> 02:23:59,420
You're by yourself, you're by yourself, Flame.

4027
02:23:59,460 --> 02:23:59,860
You're by yourself.

4028
02:24:00,360 --> 02:24:00,940
I have to loot.

4029
02:24:01,880 --> 02:24:02,160
I'm here.

4030
02:24:02,260 --> 02:24:02,980
He was on the small door.

4031
02:24:03,080 --> 02:24:03,740
He was on the small door.

4032
02:24:04,240 --> 02:24:04,720
He's... run back.

4033
02:24:06,320 --> 02:24:07,120
Hit 30 on this.

4034
02:24:07,940 --> 02:24:08,420
Oh, shit!

4035
02:24:08,500 --> 02:24:09,140
Someone's shooting from here!

4036
02:24:09,220 --> 02:24:09,980
There's people to the left, too.

4037
02:24:11,040 --> 02:24:11,520
On the left door.

4038
02:24:11,620 --> 02:24:12,400
There's two in front of me.

4039
02:24:13,520 --> 02:24:13,760
Okay.

4040
02:24:14,780 --> 02:24:15,020
Careful.

4041
02:24:15,820 --> 02:24:16,180
I'm okay.

4042
02:24:18,080 --> 02:24:18,320
Pushing!

4043
02:24:18,400 --> 02:24:18,600
I'm pushing!

4044
02:24:18,640 --> 02:24:18,860
I'm pushing!

4045
02:24:19,360 --> 02:24:19,760
I'm covering!

4046
02:24:21,200 --> 02:24:21,860
He grappled back.

4047
02:24:21,960 --> 02:24:22,320
He grappled back.

4048
02:24:22,360 --> 02:24:22,960
They're getting shot in the back!

4049
02:24:22,960 --> 02:24:23,480
We can walk up.

4050
02:24:23,660 --> 02:24:23,860
Okay.

4051
02:24:24,260 --> 02:24:24,440
Come.

4052
02:24:25,360 --> 02:24:25,580
Careful.

4053
02:24:26,800 --> 02:24:27,080
Flush!

4054
02:24:27,320 --> 02:24:27,320
Flush!

4055
02:24:27,360 --> 02:24:27,460
Flush!

4056
02:24:27,560 --> 02:24:27,660
Flush!

4057
02:24:27,660 --> 02:24:27,860
Flush!

4058
02:24:28,060 --> 02:24:28,280
Walk up!

4059
02:24:28,380 --> 02:24:28,380
Walk up!

4060
02:24:28,620 --> 02:24:28,620
Walk up!

4061
02:24:28,720 --> 02:24:28,860
Walk up!

4062
02:24:29,720 --> 02:24:30,220
I got him!

4063
02:24:31,880 --> 02:24:32,280
I'm healing!

4064
02:24:32,380 --> 02:24:32,500
I'm healing!

4065
02:24:32,740 --> 02:24:33,280
Oh, I got slain.

4066
02:24:33,560 --> 02:24:33,960
I flushed!

4067
02:24:33,960 --> 02:24:34,400
I finished him!

4068
02:24:34,420 --> 02:24:34,820
I finished him!

4069
02:24:34,860 --> 02:24:34,860
Nice!

4070
02:24:34,860 --> 02:24:34,940
Nice!

4071
02:24:34,940 --> 02:24:35,060
Nice!

4072
02:24:35,060 --> 02:24:35,120
Nice!

4073
02:24:35,180 --> 02:24:35,880
We want to fight this!

4074
02:24:35,940 --> 02:24:36,440
We want to fight this!

4075
02:24:36,740 --> 02:24:37,020
Okay.

4076
02:24:37,760 --> 02:24:38,440
I'm pushing up.

4077
02:24:38,580 --> 02:24:39,800
You're only drive next to you.

4078
02:24:39,980 --> 02:24:40,520
I had to...

4079
02:24:41,840 --> 02:24:42,120
Um...

4080
02:24:42,120 --> 02:24:43,520
I had to get that angle to get him.

4081
02:24:44,200 --> 02:24:44,760
They went to the left.

4082
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:45,240
They went left.

4083
02:24:45,280 --> 02:24:45,520
They went left.

4084
02:24:45,700 --> 02:24:46,080
They went left.

4085
02:24:48,940 --> 02:24:50,440
They went... I think he went to this house.

4086
02:24:50,480 --> 02:24:50,640
Did he?

4087
02:24:51,960 --> 02:24:52,520
He might...

4088
02:24:52,520 --> 02:24:52,940
No, no, no!

4089
02:24:53,020 --> 02:24:53,160
On me!

4090
02:24:53,420 --> 02:24:53,600
On me!

4091
02:24:53,640 --> 02:24:53,680
On me!

4092
02:24:53,680 --> 02:24:53,820
On me!

4093
02:24:53,880 --> 02:24:53,980
On me!

4094
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:54,340
Okay, okay!

4095
02:24:54,360 --> 02:24:55,020
Go to him!

4096
02:24:55,100 --> 02:24:55,580
Go to him!

4097
02:24:55,580 --> 02:24:55,680
Go to him, Jord!

4098
02:24:59,600 --> 02:25:01,340
Are you sure we have to save the chase this far?

4099
02:25:02,020 --> 02:25:02,600
No, no, no.

4100
02:25:02,880 --> 02:25:03,620
We stop right here.

4101
02:25:03,760 --> 02:25:04,240
We stop right here.

4102
02:25:05,160 --> 02:25:05,720
I'm covering.

4103
02:25:05,860 --> 02:25:06,380
I'm trying to cover.

4104
02:25:06,480 --> 02:25:08,100
That's his teammate shooting me with the triple take.

4105
02:25:08,100 --> 02:25:08,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4106
02:25:08,120 --> 02:25:08,420
That's fine.

4107
02:25:08,480 --> 02:25:09,080
I'm gonna stay here.

4108
02:25:09,140 --> 02:25:09,460
I'm staying here.

4109
02:25:09,500 --> 02:25:09,660
I'm entering here.

4110
02:25:09,660 --> 02:25:10,400
I'm just getting the thirst here.

4111
02:25:10,500 --> 02:25:11,180
Yeah, we just go back.

4112
02:25:12,940 --> 02:25:13,420
I'm walking.

4113
02:25:13,720 --> 02:25:14,640
We just go back to red.

4114
02:25:15,880 --> 02:25:16,160
Go back.

4115
02:25:16,220 --> 02:25:16,500
Go back.

4116
02:25:16,600 --> 02:25:16,760
Okay.

4117
02:25:17,320 --> 02:25:17,520
Ow!

4118
02:25:17,540 --> 02:25:17,660
Ow!

4119
02:25:17,700 --> 02:25:17,780
Ow!

4120
02:25:18,100 --> 02:25:18,380
Fuck!

4121
02:25:18,480 --> 02:25:18,720
Fine.

4122
02:25:18,860 --> 02:25:21,200
I'm gonna go bubble this box for loot.

4123
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:22,400
Yeah.

4124
02:25:26,980 --> 02:25:28,960
Uh, there's a scout here.

4125
02:25:31,540 --> 02:25:31,940
God!

4126
02:25:32,220 --> 02:25:32,340
Ow!

4127
02:25:32,860 --> 02:25:33,060
Okay.

4128
02:25:33,500 --> 02:25:34,420
There's a scope.

4129
02:25:34,580 --> 02:25:35,640
I can drop a 3x.

4130
02:25:35,640 --> 02:25:36,240
You want it?

4131
02:25:36,480 --> 02:25:36,660
No.

4132
02:25:36,900 --> 02:25:38,240
Uh, I got the 3x.

4133
02:25:38,340 --> 02:25:38,540
Okay.

4134
02:25:39,380 --> 02:25:39,980
Oh, shit!

4135
02:25:40,100 --> 02:25:40,300
Oh, shit!

4136
02:25:40,300 --> 02:25:40,400
There's no more.

4137
02:25:40,480 --> 02:25:40,760
There's more.

4138
02:25:41,580 --> 02:25:41,980
Just...

4139
02:25:41,980 --> 02:25:42,880
Yeah, just be careful.

4140
02:25:43,620 --> 02:25:45,240
We don't want to lose this here.

4141
02:25:46,760 --> 02:25:47,880
I'm gonna bubble that again.

4142
02:25:48,020 --> 02:25:49,480
I don't... What guns do they have in there?

4143
02:25:49,520 --> 02:25:49,940
I don't remember.

4144
02:25:52,160 --> 02:25:52,560
Uh...

4145
02:25:52,560 --> 02:25:53,340
I'm gonna check, actually.

4146
02:25:53,580 --> 02:25:54,500
I don't need a bubble for this.

4147
02:25:54,900 --> 02:25:55,480
It's an EVA-8.

4148
02:25:55,540 --> 02:25:55,920
I'm fine.

4149
02:25:57,060 --> 02:25:57,780
All right, where do we go?

4150
02:25:58,640 --> 02:26:01,120
Uh, we just sit here for a while until we see zone.

4151
02:26:01,420 --> 02:26:06,360
If the zone pulls like this, uh, the other side, we might have to go into geyser.

4152
02:26:06,420 --> 02:26:06,640
Okay.

4153
02:26:06,940 --> 02:26:07,860
And just wrap the back.

4154
02:26:10,140 --> 02:26:11,800
Hit a Newcastle 100 in here.

4155
02:26:12,460 --> 02:26:13,460
I have 53 on him.

4156
02:26:13,560 --> 02:26:14,260
Oh my god!

4157
02:26:14,340 --> 02:26:15,300
He destroyed my door.

4158
02:26:15,660 --> 02:26:18,000
Maybe I should get a G7 scout.

4159
02:26:18,360 --> 02:26:20,760
No, I can't 1v1 with a G7 scout.

4160
02:26:21,200 --> 02:26:23,760
I don't know if that's worth it.

4161
02:26:25,840 --> 02:26:27,960
Is it worth it for Lasky?

4162
02:26:29,320 --> 02:26:30,760
You might run whatever you want.

4163
02:26:30,940 --> 02:26:32,860
I know, but is it worth it though?

4164
02:26:34,540 --> 02:26:34,980
Probably.

4165
02:26:36,120 --> 02:26:38,120
Eh, I'll run... I'll run Carbide.

4166
02:26:38,440 --> 02:26:39,740
I'm more familiar with it.

4167
02:26:41,240 --> 02:26:42,620
We got kills at least.

4168
02:26:44,560 --> 02:26:45,680
We have...

4169
02:26:47,300 --> 02:26:47,860
What?

4170
02:26:52,660 --> 02:26:54,520
I hit 50 on the Gibby.

4171
02:26:56,920 --> 02:26:58,480
Let me know if you guys see energy.

4172
02:26:58,880 --> 02:26:59,260
Okay.

4173
02:26:59,480 --> 02:27:01,720
I might just go loot this box, I'm not gonna lie.

4174
02:27:02,180 --> 02:27:03,500
That car box?

4175
02:27:04,480 --> 02:27:04,880
Yeah.

4176
02:27:05,500 --> 02:27:06,260
I'll look for it for a bit.

4177
02:27:06,260 --> 02:27:07,080
Like ulti back?

4178
02:27:07,500 --> 02:27:07,660
Fine.

4179
02:27:08,800 --> 02:27:10,440
I'll scout them while you do that.

4180
02:27:11,580 --> 02:27:12,780
Yeah, okay, you had energy.

4181
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:13,380
Perfect.

4182
02:27:13,940 --> 02:27:15,000
They're fighting over in Fragment?

4183
02:27:15,080 --> 02:27:15,480
Mmhmm.

4184
02:27:15,860 --> 02:27:16,720
Oh, that's perfect.

4185
02:27:16,800 --> 02:27:17,260
They got an evac.

4186
02:27:19,640 --> 02:27:20,460
I'm looking.

4187
02:27:22,320 --> 02:27:23,280
Oh, Mythic.

4188
02:27:23,580 --> 02:27:24,760
Supply bin is out.

4189
02:27:26,320 --> 02:27:28,520
I got an ultimate accelerant here if you guys want.

4190
02:27:28,840 --> 02:27:31,380
Hold on, we don't need it yet, but hold on to it for now?

4191
02:27:32,460 --> 02:27:34,360
Yeah, definitely hold on to it, it's really good.

4192
02:27:34,680 --> 02:27:34,900
Yeah.

4193
02:27:36,440 --> 02:27:38,400
Okay, get ready to move here in 30 seconds.

4194
02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:39,860
Yeah, I'm looking at...

4195
02:27:39,860 --> 02:27:40,480
Are they just fighting in Fragment?

4196
02:27:40,480 --> 02:27:41,740
I'm looking west side right now.

4197
02:27:57,090 --> 02:27:59,970
I'm looking at Geyser to see if anybody's sneaking up there.

4198
02:28:00,270 --> 02:28:01,810
I wonder if there's a team in Geyser.

4199
02:28:01,810 --> 02:28:02,710
That's what I'm afraid of.

4200
02:28:03,990 --> 02:28:06,590
Yeah, definitely probably is.

4201
02:28:08,030 --> 02:28:08,930
Get ready to move.

4202
02:28:09,270 --> 02:28:11,510
Oh, I didn't see them there.

4203
02:28:16,430 --> 02:28:18,350
Oh, oh, but we can cross their zone.

4204
02:28:18,790 --> 02:28:20,630
Yeah, we have to go through Geyser.

4205
02:28:20,630 --> 02:28:21,730
Yeah, Dry, come, come, come, come, Dry.

4206
02:28:22,150 --> 02:28:22,770
We have to go now.

4207
02:28:23,430 --> 02:28:24,950
We're wrapping behind Geyser.

4208
02:28:25,250 --> 02:28:26,170
Yeah, you have to come, come now.

4209
02:28:26,230 --> 02:28:27,770
We want to be under the bridge here.

4210
02:28:28,790 --> 02:28:29,910
There's batteries here.

4211
02:28:30,330 --> 02:28:32,230
I don't need batteries, I have four.

4212
02:28:34,090 --> 02:28:35,730
You should grab batteries, Druid.

4213
02:28:36,090 --> 02:28:36,490
What's going on?

4214
02:28:36,570 --> 02:28:36,770
Got him.

4215
02:28:36,990 --> 02:28:37,770
We don't have much time.

4216
02:28:38,050 --> 02:28:38,250
Yeah.

4217
02:28:41,810 --> 02:28:43,790
Yeah, we want to be under that bridge.

4218
02:28:44,090 --> 02:28:46,990
That's like the only safe spot pretty much.

4219
02:28:48,670 --> 02:28:49,930
I'm looking to our left just in case.

4220
02:28:53,970 --> 02:28:54,710
There's a gold...

4221
02:28:56,630 --> 02:28:57,850
There's a blue cache here.

4222
02:28:59,910 --> 02:29:00,530
Nice to go.

4223
02:29:01,070 --> 02:29:01,410
All right.

4224
02:29:01,590 --> 02:29:02,490
Keep going, keep going, keep going.

4225
02:29:03,870 --> 02:29:05,630
We do not have time here.

4226
02:29:06,490 --> 02:29:09,810
We gotta keep going, keep running.

4227
02:29:15,410 --> 02:29:17,710
Oh, you're fighting in front of us.

4228
02:29:17,770 --> 02:29:18,370
That's really good for us.

4229
02:29:18,430 --> 02:29:19,390
Just full heal, full heal right away.

4230
02:29:19,430 --> 02:29:19,790
I have the syringe.

4231
02:29:20,470 --> 02:29:20,830
Yeah.

4232
02:29:21,910 --> 02:29:23,510
Syringe, syringe the moment you get in, Dry.

4233
02:29:24,470 --> 02:29:25,110
Yep, yep, yep.

4234
02:29:25,950 --> 02:29:27,130
They're fighting right here, here.

4235
02:29:27,190 --> 02:29:27,930
Just walk up.

4236
02:29:28,290 --> 02:29:29,130
I'm walking behind you.

4237
02:29:30,070 --> 02:29:31,010
I'm a gunner just in case.

4238
02:29:33,930 --> 02:29:34,570
No, no, no.

4239
02:29:34,690 --> 02:29:36,490
Come, come, we're hitting this Geyser.

4240
02:29:38,230 --> 02:29:39,170
Should we do it still?

4241
02:29:39,170 --> 02:29:40,510
Just hit the Geyser, hit the Geyser.

4242
02:29:40,710 --> 02:29:41,830
Where do we go, where do we go, Geyser?

4243
02:29:41,930 --> 02:29:42,590
We have to wait for Gerard.

4244
02:29:43,070 --> 02:29:43,490
All right, come on.

4245
02:29:43,590 --> 02:29:43,950
Come to me.

4246
02:29:44,610 --> 02:29:45,710
Here, here, here, come here, come here.

4247
02:29:45,810 --> 02:29:46,990
Come here.

4248
02:29:47,430 --> 02:29:48,310
Okay, going, going, going.

4249
02:29:48,550 --> 02:29:49,150
Yeah, the reason...

4250
02:29:49,150 --> 02:29:49,810
Run, run, run.

4251
02:29:49,890 --> 02:29:50,330
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready.

4252
02:29:50,710 --> 02:29:50,990
Just...

4253
02:29:50,990 --> 02:29:52,450
Oh, he can watch us, he can watch us.

4254
02:29:52,950 --> 02:29:54,310
Okay, go, go, go, go, okay.

4255
02:29:56,510 --> 02:29:57,790
Land, land underneath here.

4256
02:29:57,950 --> 02:29:59,870
Just keep, keep running with it, keep running with it.

4257
02:30:00,090 --> 02:30:00,330
Yeah.

4258
02:30:00,510 --> 02:30:01,150
Yep, keep running.

4259
02:30:03,810 --> 02:30:06,770
Go straight, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going.

4260
02:30:06,990 --> 02:30:07,770
Slide if you have to.

4261
02:30:07,790 --> 02:30:08,030
Keep going.

4262
02:30:09,170 --> 02:30:10,070
In the open here, Maggie.

4263
02:30:10,850 --> 02:30:11,670
Okay, I'm looking.

4264
02:30:12,010 --> 02:30:12,970
On HP, dead, dead, dead.

4265
02:30:13,070 --> 02:30:13,330
Lifeline.

4266
02:30:14,350 --> 02:30:14,950
Florescent, florescent.

4267
02:30:14,990 --> 02:30:15,630
Nice, good, there's...

4268
02:30:15,630 --> 02:30:18,450
Wait, just sit here, just sit here and look for these kills, look for these kills.

4269
02:30:19,130 --> 02:30:20,870
I'm looking behind, I'm looking behind, just in case.

4270
02:30:20,950 --> 02:30:21,510
I'm gonna look behind.

4271
02:30:21,590 --> 02:30:22,610
Okay, go ahead, yep.

4272
02:30:22,890 --> 02:30:25,030
Just come, someone else look here, heal skills.

4273
02:30:26,850 --> 02:30:27,530
One more, one more.

4274
02:30:27,970 --> 02:30:28,490
In zone, in zone.

4275
02:30:28,750 --> 02:30:28,930
Gibby.

4276
02:30:29,250 --> 02:30:29,670
He's dead.

4277
02:30:29,910 --> 02:30:30,170
Oh, wow.

4278
02:30:30,410 --> 02:30:31,210
Oh, we didn't get that kill.

4279
02:30:31,590 --> 02:30:32,310
It's fine, it's fine.

4280
02:30:32,670 --> 02:30:33,910
I'm gonna look, I'm gonna look just in case.

4281
02:30:33,910 --> 02:30:36,430
Listen, we need to make a run for this.

4282
02:30:36,510 --> 02:30:37,530
We should go now, we should go now.

4283
02:30:37,910 --> 02:30:39,990
You have to be careful of the buff, get rid of your bubble.

4284
02:30:40,950 --> 02:30:42,470
Come to road, stay with us.

4285
02:30:43,170 --> 02:30:44,330
Hug right, hug right.

4286
02:30:45,690 --> 02:30:46,210
Just hug right.

4287
02:30:46,530 --> 02:30:48,230
We're safe on me, safe on me, just keep going.

4288
02:30:48,730 --> 02:30:49,410
Keep going, keep going.

4289
02:30:50,270 --> 02:30:50,870
Full heal, full heal.

4290
02:30:51,670 --> 02:30:52,890
Just full heal and bubble first.

4291
02:30:56,670 --> 02:30:58,650
Go as soon as you're done healing, I'll look for you guys.

4292
02:30:59,110 --> 02:31:00,470
I'm right behind you, I'm right behind you.

4293
02:31:00,530 --> 02:31:01,670
Yeah, we're okay, just keep going.

4294
02:31:01,790 --> 02:31:03,750
There's a team, but they're getting the guy.

4295
02:31:04,030 --> 02:31:04,530
I think...

4296
02:31:05,070 --> 02:31:06,450
Do you want me to come to you, or no?

4297
02:31:06,450 --> 02:31:07,450
I think the safe spot is like...

4298
02:31:08,610 --> 02:31:10,190
Yeah, I think it's on me, I think it's on me.

4299
02:31:10,370 --> 02:31:11,990
Okay, I can stay here for now.

4300
02:31:12,190 --> 02:31:14,010
And Jarrad, you go to flame, you go to flame, Jarrad.

4301
02:31:14,430 --> 02:31:16,710
I have bubble, so if anything happens, I can just bubble.

4302
02:31:17,730 --> 02:31:18,790
And we have a crafter here.

4303
02:31:19,610 --> 02:31:21,490
Yeah, I think we're okay here.

4304
02:31:23,650 --> 02:31:25,910
I'm gonna look behind, I'm looking this way, I'm looking this way.

4305
02:31:25,950 --> 02:31:28,330
If you need me to shoot something, just tell me, I'll turn around.

4306
02:31:28,450 --> 02:31:30,010
Because I have my crafting as a cover.

4307
02:31:32,090 --> 02:31:32,410
Okay.

4308
02:31:34,830 --> 02:31:37,290
We have to be really careful of teams like flying on us.

4309
02:31:37,450 --> 02:31:38,590
That's probably our biggest threat.

4310
02:31:38,850 --> 02:31:40,370
Yeah, I'm looking, I'm just looking this way.

4311
02:31:40,390 --> 02:31:42,030
We can play above us, but I don't...

4312
02:31:42,030 --> 02:31:42,770
I don't think it's safe.

4313
02:31:42,770 --> 02:31:43,850
I don't know if it'll be worth it.

4314
02:31:44,110 --> 02:31:44,590
I don't think so.

4315
02:31:44,690 --> 02:31:48,090
It'll be safe for sure, because we have rampart and new castle.

4316
02:31:49,510 --> 02:31:51,010
But I mean, I don't have wall.

4317
02:31:52,810 --> 02:31:53,650
I hear something on my left.

4318
02:31:53,890 --> 02:31:55,090
I think that's above me.

4319
02:31:55,250 --> 02:31:56,610
We could get pinched really hard.

4320
02:31:56,830 --> 02:31:57,090
Yeah.

4321
02:31:57,970 --> 02:31:58,830
No, I'm peeking.

4322
02:32:00,930 --> 02:32:02,130
Is there a team right here?

4323
02:32:02,170 --> 02:32:03,190
I think it's just better.

4324
02:32:03,510 --> 02:32:05,770
I think we should just go up top, to be honest.

4325
02:32:05,970 --> 02:32:06,890
Jarrad, you go up top.

4326
02:32:06,890 --> 02:32:07,770
I'll go last.

4327
02:32:08,610 --> 02:32:09,190
And you just set up.

4328
02:32:09,790 --> 02:32:10,250
And I'll go now.

4329
02:32:10,410 --> 02:32:12,630
We just set up right here on my corner here, Jarrad.

4330
02:32:12,730 --> 02:32:14,910
You just have to start like, putting rampart walls.

4331
02:32:15,110 --> 02:32:16,990
Like, uh, put rampart walls towards this way.

4332
02:32:17,170 --> 02:32:17,750
And then put some towards the left.

4333
02:32:17,750 --> 02:32:18,990
I'll stay in the bottom for now.

4334
02:32:19,090 --> 02:32:20,010
And I'll come up later.

4335
02:32:21,250 --> 02:32:22,010
I want to make sure there's...

4336
02:32:22,010 --> 02:32:22,450
Put another one like...

4337
02:32:22,450 --> 02:32:22,950
Wait, wait, wait.

4338
02:32:22,970 --> 02:32:23,310
I'm here.

4339
02:32:23,370 --> 02:32:23,870
Don't box us in.

4340
02:32:23,870 --> 02:32:24,290
Two seconds.

4341
02:32:24,670 --> 02:32:25,010
Two seconds.

4342
02:32:25,090 --> 02:32:25,250
Yeah.

4343
02:32:25,550 --> 02:32:26,290
Don't box us in.

4344
02:32:26,690 --> 02:32:27,690
Make sure we have...

4345
02:32:27,690 --> 02:32:28,170
No, no, no.

4346
02:32:28,470 --> 02:32:29,810
Move it a little bit more forward.

4347
02:32:30,370 --> 02:32:32,710
So we can like, walk like right here, you know?

4348
02:32:32,710 --> 02:32:33,310
They're pushing.

4349
02:32:33,470 --> 02:32:34,190
They might push.

4350
02:32:34,290 --> 02:32:34,630
They might push.

4351
02:32:34,630 --> 02:32:35,210
They're walking up.

4352
02:32:35,310 --> 02:32:35,950
They're slowly walking up.

4353
02:32:36,010 --> 02:32:36,310
They're right here.

4354
02:32:37,250 --> 02:32:37,670
Just look.

4355
02:32:37,870 --> 02:32:38,250
Okay, no, no.

4356
02:32:38,290 --> 02:32:38,710
That's fine.

4357
02:32:38,750 --> 02:32:39,010
That's fine.

4358
02:32:39,050 --> 02:32:39,430
Just come up.

4359
02:32:39,530 --> 02:32:39,910
Just come up.

4360
02:32:40,050 --> 02:32:40,170
It's okay.

4361
02:32:40,230 --> 02:32:40,770
I'm coming up now.

4362
02:32:42,850 --> 02:32:44,130
They're fighting right here.

4363
02:32:44,270 --> 02:32:45,230
We might have kills right there.

4364
02:32:45,390 --> 02:32:46,110
As soon as smoke fades.

4365
02:32:46,210 --> 02:32:46,470
Look at this.

4366
02:32:46,670 --> 02:32:46,810
Okay, okay.

4367
02:32:46,950 --> 02:32:47,250
I'm here.

4368
02:32:48,010 --> 02:32:48,850
There's enemies over here.

4369
02:32:49,050 --> 02:32:50,190
Uh, he's totally down.

4370
02:32:51,230 --> 02:32:51,710
Right here?

4371
02:32:51,830 --> 02:32:52,790
There's a guy right here.

4372
02:32:53,370 --> 02:32:53,650
Yeah.

4373
02:32:56,510 --> 02:32:56,790
He's...

4374
02:32:56,790 --> 02:32:56,990
He's...

4375
02:32:56,990 --> 02:32:57,410
Oh, they're rotating.

4376
02:32:57,490 --> 02:32:57,710
They're rotating.

4377
02:32:58,850 --> 02:32:59,670
Nah, nothing, nothing.

4378
02:33:00,510 --> 02:33:00,790
Uh, Jarrad.

4379
02:33:00,910 --> 02:33:03,350
If we're shooting like that, you have to look at the other angle.

4380
02:33:03,450 --> 02:33:03,730
Okay, Jarrad.

4381
02:33:03,730 --> 02:33:04,790
Uh, look at zone.

4382
02:33:04,910 --> 02:33:05,170
Look at zone.

4383
02:33:05,370 --> 02:33:05,570
Fuck.

4384
02:33:06,290 --> 02:33:06,550
Okay.

4385
02:33:06,710 --> 02:33:06,870
Is it over here?

4386
02:33:07,510 --> 02:33:08,390
Um, wait.

4387
02:33:08,550 --> 02:33:09,570
I'm walking forward here.

4388
02:33:09,830 --> 02:33:10,270
Okay, come over there.

4389
02:33:10,290 --> 02:33:10,550
Come over there.

4390
02:33:10,590 --> 02:33:10,770
Come over there.

4391
02:33:10,770 --> 02:33:11,130
Come over there.

4392
02:33:11,170 --> 02:33:11,670
Okay, I'm coming over here.

4393
02:33:16,490 --> 02:33:16,990
I'm okay.

4394
02:33:18,710 --> 02:33:20,170
Just chill, chill, chill, chill, chill.

4395
02:33:21,070 --> 02:33:22,910
We're gonna walk for the crane here.

4396
02:33:23,190 --> 02:33:24,650
I'm looking behind us just in case.

4397
02:33:25,190 --> 02:33:25,750
Yeah, we just...

4398
02:33:25,750 --> 02:33:26,490
We just go back again.

4399
02:33:26,570 --> 02:33:26,950
Go back again.

4400
02:33:28,970 --> 02:33:31,130
Listen, we need to hold our northeast side here.

4401
02:33:31,450 --> 02:33:34,270
And then our play is to jump towards the crane here late.

4402
02:33:34,470 --> 02:33:34,830
Okay.

4403
02:33:35,110 --> 02:33:35,650
Oh my god.

4404
02:33:35,650 --> 02:33:36,030
I'm looking back.

4405
02:33:37,070 --> 02:33:37,870
There's a guy right here.

4406
02:33:38,050 --> 02:33:38,190
There's a guy.

4407
02:33:38,550 --> 02:33:38,690
There's a team.

4408
02:33:38,770 --> 02:33:39,410
There's a team right here.

4409
02:33:40,090 --> 02:33:40,670
Okay, I'm looking in front.

4410
02:33:40,690 --> 02:33:41,150
I'm looking in front.

4411
02:33:41,310 --> 02:33:41,710
I'm looking in front.

4412
02:33:44,550 --> 02:33:45,930
They threw a rez beacon out.

4413
02:33:46,290 --> 02:33:46,650
I'm looking.

4414
02:33:46,910 --> 02:33:47,790
They're planting a rezzing.

4415
02:33:48,630 --> 02:33:49,470
Oh, they're rezzing.

4416
02:33:51,410 --> 02:33:53,930
I think we maybe just drop down here.

4417
02:33:54,150 --> 02:33:54,390
Okay.

4418
02:33:55,590 --> 02:33:56,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4419
02:33:56,070 --> 02:33:56,210
You drop down.

4420
02:33:56,210 --> 02:33:57,250
You drop, drop, drop with it.

4421
02:33:57,250 --> 02:33:57,790
You go now.

4422
02:33:57,810 --> 02:33:58,130
Come with me.

4423
02:33:58,190 --> 02:33:58,430
Come with...

4424
02:33:58,430 --> 02:33:58,650
No, no.

4425
02:33:58,650 --> 02:33:59,030
Come with us.

4426
02:33:59,050 --> 02:33:59,350
Come with us.

4427
02:33:59,430 --> 02:33:59,510
Okay.

4428
02:33:59,590 --> 02:33:59,910
Come with us.

4429
02:33:59,970 --> 02:34:00,370
Uh, zipping.

4430
02:34:01,010 --> 02:34:01,470
No, that's fine.

4431
02:34:01,710 --> 02:34:02,130
Go now.

4432
02:34:02,190 --> 02:34:02,390
Go now.

4433
02:34:02,450 --> 02:34:02,730
Come with me.

4434
02:34:02,790 --> 02:34:03,070
Come with me.

4435
02:34:03,090 --> 02:34:03,390
Come with me.

4436
02:34:03,390 --> 02:34:03,810
Come with me.

4437
02:34:05,350 --> 02:34:06,110
Just keep coming.

4438
02:34:06,270 --> 02:34:06,530
Keep coming.

4439
02:34:07,730 --> 02:34:08,270
Landing on us.

4440
02:34:08,390 --> 02:34:08,830
No, above us.

4441
02:34:08,990 --> 02:34:09,130
We're okay.

4442
02:34:09,230 --> 02:34:09,490
We're okay.

4443
02:34:09,630 --> 02:34:09,970
Just sit here.

4444
02:34:10,470 --> 02:34:11,010
Get ready to bubble.

4445
02:34:12,310 --> 02:34:13,110
They might drop on us here.

4446
02:34:13,390 --> 02:34:14,130
Send, send rampart covers.

4447
02:34:14,270 --> 02:34:14,550
Anywhere.

4448
02:34:14,650 --> 02:34:14,810
Anywhere.

4449
02:34:14,890 --> 02:34:15,050
Anywhere.

4450
02:34:15,190 --> 02:34:15,830
Just put, put walls.

4451
02:34:15,910 --> 02:34:16,630
Put walls, Gerard.

4452
02:34:16,710 --> 02:34:17,030
Put walls.

4453
02:34:17,870 --> 02:34:18,550
Just start putting walls.

4454
02:34:19,270 --> 02:34:19,390
Yeah.

4455
02:34:20,190 --> 02:34:21,650
We need to look up here, Doki.

4456
02:34:21,930 --> 02:34:22,450
I'm looking up.

4457
02:34:22,490 --> 02:34:22,870
I'm looking up.

4458
02:34:22,910 --> 02:34:23,290
I'm looking up.

4459
02:34:26,210 --> 02:34:26,490
Okay.

4460
02:34:26,910 --> 02:34:28,470
Uh, I'm, I'm walling towards the left here.

4461
02:34:28,790 --> 02:34:29,590
There's a team out in the left.

4462
02:34:29,650 --> 02:34:30,170
We have to get...

4463
02:34:30,170 --> 02:34:30,550
They have...

4464
02:34:30,550 --> 02:34:31,210
We have to kill this team.

4465
02:34:31,430 --> 02:34:32,070
Okay, okay, I'm looking.

4466
02:34:33,330 --> 02:34:35,530
Gerard, you have to just sit behind the rampart.

4467
02:34:35,610 --> 02:34:36,590
Hey, yeah, give us walls.

4468
02:34:36,670 --> 02:34:36,990
Give us walls.

4469
02:34:37,970 --> 02:34:38,390
They're right here.

4470
02:34:38,430 --> 02:34:39,090
They're right here behind us.

4471
02:34:39,230 --> 02:34:39,530
They're behind us.

4472
02:34:39,530 --> 02:34:39,890
One second, one second.

4473
02:34:40,690 --> 02:34:41,630
There's a team right in front of us.

4474
02:34:41,730 --> 02:34:42,070
I'm going to look.

4475
02:34:42,210 --> 02:34:42,690
Be careful behind us.

4476
02:34:43,750 --> 02:34:44,390
There's a team right in front.

4477
02:34:44,490 --> 02:34:45,030
I'm, I'm shooting.

4478
02:34:45,090 --> 02:34:45,630
I'm shooting this team.

4479
02:34:46,030 --> 02:34:46,410
They're in the open.

4480
02:34:47,350 --> 02:34:48,970
We just have to spread attention here.

4481
02:34:50,730 --> 02:34:51,290
I'm safe.

4482
02:34:51,390 --> 02:34:51,650
I'm safe.

4483
02:34:51,670 --> 02:34:51,970
Okay, okay.

4484
02:34:52,010 --> 02:34:52,730
I'm shooting this team.

4485
02:34:52,730 --> 02:34:53,570
I'm shooting this team in front of me.

4486
02:34:55,830 --> 02:34:58,210
There's a, there's a full team in Gibby bubble in front of me here.

4487
02:34:58,970 --> 02:34:59,810
They're going to walk at us.

4488
02:35:00,970 --> 02:35:01,650
This team has to die, Doki.

4489
02:35:01,650 --> 02:35:03,070
This team is walking.

4490
02:35:03,250 --> 02:35:03,950
I'm, I'm ulting.

4491
02:35:04,170 --> 02:35:04,610
Walking at us?

4492
02:35:05,070 --> 02:35:05,390
Yeah, yeah.

4493
02:35:05,410 --> 02:35:05,590
Fuck.

4494
02:35:08,110 --> 02:35:09,550
Just chill, chill towards us, Doki.

4495
02:35:09,790 --> 02:35:10,590
I'm, I'm bubbling.

4496
02:35:10,730 --> 02:35:10,990
I'm bubbling.

4497
02:35:11,930 --> 02:35:13,230
There's a team literally in front of me.

4498
02:35:13,390 --> 02:35:14,410
I have to, I have to ult it.

4499
02:35:14,750 --> 02:35:15,290
They bubble too.

4500
02:35:15,550 --> 02:35:16,150
I knocked one.

4501
02:35:16,250 --> 02:35:17,390
Just crouching here in front of me.

4502
02:35:17,510 --> 02:35:18,350
There's two teams on us.

4503
02:35:18,370 --> 02:35:18,730
Okay, okay, okay.

4504
02:35:19,290 --> 02:35:20,910
I think, I think we have to focus towards Doki's side.

4505
02:35:20,990 --> 02:35:21,930
Go, go, go Doki's side.

4506
02:35:21,990 --> 02:35:22,330
He's rezzing.

4507
02:35:22,530 --> 02:35:22,950
He's rezzing.

4508
02:35:23,150 --> 02:35:23,610
Just push this.

4509
02:35:24,270 --> 02:35:25,210
Push this, push this, push this.

4510
02:35:26,910 --> 02:35:27,390
Push this.

4511
02:35:30,130 --> 02:35:30,510
Get in.

4512
02:35:31,750 --> 02:35:32,230
Do you have bubble?

4513
02:35:32,650 --> 02:35:33,550
I used it, I used it.

4514
02:35:33,610 --> 02:35:34,430
Two seconds, two seconds.

4515
02:35:34,770 --> 02:35:35,110
Okay, okay.

4516
02:35:35,950 --> 02:35:36,410
Oh shit.

4517
02:35:36,530 --> 02:35:37,770
I got, I got the bubble.

4518
02:35:38,030 --> 02:35:38,390
Bubble, bubble.

4519
02:35:38,550 --> 02:35:38,930
Nice, nice.

4520
02:35:39,030 --> 02:35:39,870
There's a Kraber there, Doki.

4521
02:35:40,970 --> 02:35:41,670
I'm not gonna take it.

4522
02:35:41,690 --> 02:35:41,810
You got that, I believe.

4523
02:35:43,430 --> 02:35:44,370
All right, we're gonna go back here.

4524
02:35:44,450 --> 02:35:44,890
We're gonna go back.

4525
02:35:45,150 --> 02:35:45,730
Go back, go back.

4526
02:35:47,310 --> 02:35:48,930
Actually, uh, I'll take the Kraber.

4527
02:35:48,990 --> 02:35:49,570
I'll take the Kraber now.

4528
02:35:50,290 --> 02:35:50,450
Yeah.

4529
02:35:51,670 --> 02:35:52,710
It's four bullets though.

4530
02:35:55,250 --> 02:35:56,590
They're fighting the other side of our wall here.

4531
02:35:56,750 --> 02:35:59,170
Just, just set Rampart, uh, set, set Rampart walls on me.

4532
02:35:59,230 --> 02:36:00,050
On me, on me, on me, on me.

4533
02:36:00,050 --> 02:36:00,610
Yeah, yeah, just set.

4534
02:36:00,650 --> 02:36:01,450
No, it's the right and the left.

4535
02:36:02,130 --> 02:36:04,710
There's a team just playing on the other side here.

4536
02:36:05,290 --> 02:36:07,930
Doki, can you come bubble up on this?

4537
02:36:07,990 --> 02:36:08,530
We swing this team.

4538
02:36:08,770 --> 02:36:08,830
Ready?

4539
02:36:09,030 --> 02:36:09,250
Yeah, bubble.

4540
02:36:09,450 --> 02:36:10,750
One, two, three, go.

4541
02:36:11,750 --> 02:36:12,570
On me, on me, on me, on me.

4542
02:36:12,790 --> 02:36:13,030
Bubbling.

4543
02:36:14,870 --> 02:36:15,750
It's a solo Newcastle.

4544
02:36:16,370 --> 02:36:17,090
Get this kill, get this kill.

4545
02:36:18,350 --> 02:36:18,630
Dead.

4546
02:36:18,790 --> 02:36:19,090
Nice, nice.

4547
02:36:19,090 --> 02:36:19,550
Come back, come back.

4548
02:36:19,570 --> 02:36:20,110
Come back in the bubble.

4549
02:36:20,270 --> 02:36:21,050
Full team, full team now.

4550
02:36:21,150 --> 02:36:22,410
Go back, go back, go back, go back.

4551
02:36:22,790 --> 02:36:23,570
Go back and then heal.

4552
02:36:24,430 --> 02:36:25,390
We have to look left here.

4553
02:36:26,150 --> 02:36:26,710
They ulted again.

4554
02:36:26,710 --> 02:36:27,250
No bubble, no bubble, no bubble.

4555
02:36:27,270 --> 02:36:28,570
Come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me.

4556
02:36:28,690 --> 02:36:29,530
Crouch on me, we're okay.

4557
02:36:30,370 --> 02:36:31,330
We have to look left here.

4558
02:36:31,450 --> 02:36:32,330
Just full heal first.

4559
02:36:32,730 --> 02:36:33,590
I'm looking left, I'm looking left.

4560
02:36:33,710 --> 02:36:34,390
Okay, look with me.

4561
02:36:34,570 --> 02:36:34,750
Yeah.

4562
02:36:35,730 --> 02:36:37,570
They're behind, they're behind this box here.

4563
02:36:37,930 --> 02:36:38,730
One down, one down, I think.

4564
02:36:39,250 --> 02:36:39,990
I'm peeking this, I'm peeking this.

4565
02:36:39,990 --> 02:36:40,830
I need a bubble, I need a bubble.

4566
02:36:41,370 --> 02:36:42,630
They ulted us, they ulted us, they ulted us.

4567
02:36:42,650 --> 02:36:43,310
I killed one, I killed one.

4568
02:36:44,310 --> 02:36:45,890
Oh, I got hit, I got hit by the ult.

4569
02:36:46,090 --> 02:36:46,290
Yeah.

4570
02:36:47,130 --> 02:36:48,290
I have no shields, I have no shields.

4571
02:36:48,870 --> 02:36:49,370
I have no shields.

4572
02:36:50,170 --> 02:36:51,570
Gerard, give me shields, Gerard, give me shields.

4573
02:36:51,950 --> 02:36:52,370
Drop shields.

4574
02:36:52,470 --> 02:36:53,270
Okay, uh, here.

4575
02:36:53,470 --> 02:36:53,670
Thank you.

4576
02:36:53,770 --> 02:36:54,430
That's all I have.

4577
02:36:54,630 --> 02:36:55,290
That's fine, that's fine, that's fine.

4578
02:36:55,450 --> 02:36:56,570
I have bubble on A, I have bubble on A.

4579
02:36:56,570 --> 02:36:57,130
I'm just pushing.

4580
02:36:59,090 --> 02:36:59,910
I got him.

4581
02:36:59,970 --> 02:37:00,290
Nice.

4582
02:37:00,570 --> 02:37:01,870
Look above, look above, look above.

4583
02:37:02,110 --> 02:37:03,470
I have to heal, I have to heal.

4584
02:37:05,090 --> 02:37:06,470
People are gonna start dropping on us soon.

4585
02:37:06,690 --> 02:37:06,950
Get ready.

4586
02:37:07,050 --> 02:37:07,170
Okay.

4587
02:37:10,070 --> 02:37:11,250
We have end zone, guys.

4588
02:37:11,350 --> 02:37:12,630
Come, come set up on end zone here.

4589
02:37:13,290 --> 02:37:15,730
Gerard, put rampart covers on the outside.

4590
02:37:17,470 --> 02:37:18,330
On me, uh...

4591
02:37:19,670 --> 02:37:21,410
On me, Gerard, on me, facing this way.

4592
02:37:21,750 --> 02:37:22,230
Facing the left.

4593
02:37:22,510 --> 02:37:23,370
There's a team top crane!

4594
02:37:23,650 --> 02:37:24,590
Team top crane, we can fuck!

4595
02:37:25,350 --> 02:37:26,550
I can't see, I can't see, I got hit!

4596
02:37:26,550 --> 02:37:27,710
I can't see.

4597
02:37:28,510 --> 02:37:28,750
Okay.

4598
02:37:29,830 --> 02:37:31,790
I naded them, jumping, jumping on us, jumping on us!

4599
02:37:32,010 --> 02:37:32,510
Jumping on us!

4600
02:37:34,290 --> 02:37:34,910
Jumping on us!

4601
02:37:35,250 --> 02:37:35,930
Kill this, kill this!

4602
02:37:36,830 --> 02:37:37,470
One HP, give me!

4603
02:37:37,510 --> 02:37:38,110
Ah, god, ah!

4604
02:37:39,330 --> 02:37:40,610
Hey, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill.

4605
02:37:40,970 --> 02:37:41,410
I'm okay, I'm okay.

4606
02:37:42,750 --> 02:37:44,010
They're fighting up top, top floor.

4607
02:37:44,970 --> 02:37:46,050
I can push, I can push, I'm pushing.

4608
02:37:46,330 --> 02:37:46,590
Fuck.

4609
02:37:47,190 --> 02:37:48,070
Oh, they're fighting up here, okay.

4610
02:37:49,150 --> 02:37:50,170
There's a team on our left.

4611
02:37:50,650 --> 02:37:51,390
Above us, above us.

4612
02:37:51,690 --> 02:37:52,170
On our left.

4613
02:37:53,050 --> 02:37:53,630
I killed one.

4614
02:37:53,650 --> 02:37:55,050
I got Gerard, I got Gerard there.

4615
02:37:58,410 --> 02:37:58,950
Just chill.

4616
02:38:00,030 --> 02:38:00,750
We have to walk forward.

4617
02:38:00,770 --> 02:38:01,470
We have to walk forward, yeah.

4618
02:38:03,950 --> 02:38:04,770
Oh, I quit!

4619
02:38:05,230 --> 02:38:06,470
Oh, we got third, though.

4620
02:38:06,950 --> 02:38:07,730
MT, MT, MT.

4621
02:38:07,730 --> 02:38:08,570
I think, yeah, yeah.

4622
02:38:09,230 --> 02:38:09,550
Ah!

4623
02:38:10,310 --> 02:38:10,630
MT.

4624
02:38:10,930 --> 02:38:11,530
We got third!

4625
02:38:11,750 --> 02:38:13,330
That's a good game, though, for us.

4626
02:38:13,490 --> 02:38:14,030
Yeah, it's nice.

4627
02:38:14,030 --> 02:38:15,390
That's a really good game.

4628
02:38:15,650 --> 02:38:15,970
Yeah.

4629
02:38:16,950 --> 02:38:17,270
Ah.

4630
02:38:19,750 --> 02:38:20,110
Surviving is fast.

4631
02:38:20,110 --> 02:38:21,230
Oh, that was intense, though.

4632
02:38:21,330 --> 02:38:21,370
So true.

4633
02:38:21,570 --> 02:38:23,950
They just had high ground, we couldn't really, they just had high ground.

4634
02:38:23,970 --> 02:38:25,150
Yeah, it's really rough.

4635
02:38:25,270 --> 02:38:25,630
Yeah.

4636
02:38:25,630 --> 02:38:31,410
The team on the crane, instead of thirding the team that's, like, fighting under them, it's just, like, completely pushed us.

4637
02:38:31,750 --> 02:38:34,070
Yeah, that's fine.

4638
02:38:34,090 --> 02:38:36,050
I got, I got two kills off of that, though.

4639
02:38:36,870 --> 02:38:37,310
Nice.

4640
02:38:38,150 --> 02:38:39,030
Hundred damage.

4641
02:38:39,450 --> 02:38:39,690
Again.

4642
02:38:40,190 --> 02:38:41,430
Whoa, that's all I could do.

4643
02:38:42,490 --> 02:38:43,150
That's good!

4644
02:38:43,510 --> 02:38:44,350
That's solid!

4645
02:38:44,630 --> 02:38:45,990
Okay, I think we got top ten.

4646
02:38:46,330 --> 02:38:49,550
I think, with those places, we must have got top ten.

4647
02:38:49,910 --> 02:38:51,210
We got ten kills!

4648
02:38:51,730 --> 02:38:52,270
Oh, my gosh.

4649
02:38:52,730 --> 02:38:52,830
Yay!

4650
02:38:53,890 --> 02:38:57,490
We should be top, we could even be top five.

4651
02:38:58,110 --> 02:38:58,950
You'd be what?

4652
02:38:59,790 --> 02:39:02,130
We could be top three, but we should be top five.

4653
02:39:02,210 --> 02:39:04,150
Whoa, top five!

4654
02:39:04,490 --> 02:39:05,310
That's crazy!

4655
02:39:05,830 --> 02:39:05,910
Bro, Flame's IGLing is insane!

4656
02:39:05,910 --> 02:39:08,890
Are we actually, somebody back check that one right now!

4657
02:39:09,410 --> 02:39:09,890
Yeah.

4658
02:39:11,090 --> 02:39:14,350
Guys, you gotta check out Strafe and Flame on Twitter and YouTube and Twitch.

4659
02:39:14,910 --> 02:39:16,350

4663
02:39:20,550 --> 02:39:22,130
Follow his champion's journey.

4664
02:39:22,130 --> 02:39:25,270
Anyway, Strafe and Flame, you should totally try out Marvel Rivals rink.

4665
02:39:25,450 --> 02:39:25,930
Yeah, you should.

4666
02:39:27,210 --> 02:39:27,570
Yeah?

4667
02:39:28,030 --> 02:39:28,390
Yeah.

4668
02:39:28,790 --> 02:39:30,370
What do you have against me, huh?

4669
02:39:30,670 --> 02:39:32,230
How do you want to see me fail so bad?

4670
02:39:32,790 --> 02:39:33,310
What's going on?

4671
02:39:34,030 --> 02:39:34,750
It's fun.

4672
02:39:34,910 --> 02:39:35,730
Go ahead, try it.

4673
02:39:36,570 --> 02:39:37,690
Man, it's so fun.

4674
02:39:39,790 --> 02:39:41,450
At least you're not solo queuing.

4675
02:39:41,530 --> 02:39:43,290
You got dokie once you get used to it, you know?

4676
02:39:43,450 --> 02:39:44,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

4677
02:39:44,610 --> 02:39:45,550
You can play with me!

4678
02:39:47,210 --> 02:39:48,750
But only for your GM, though.

4679
02:39:48,770 --> 02:39:49,230
When you hit GM.

4680
02:39:49,230 --> 02:39:50,310
You can able each other!

4681
02:39:50,530 --> 02:39:51,090
That's great!

4682
02:39:53,070 --> 02:39:53,550
Okay.

4683
02:39:55,870 --> 02:39:56,690
That's fine.

4684
02:39:56,870 --> 02:39:57,690
It's okay.

4685
02:39:57,990 --> 02:40:00,070
I mean, we did so well.

4686
02:40:00,150 --> 02:40:02,150
I'm actually so proud of us.

4687
02:40:02,270 --> 02:40:05,490
But because we did so well, we might need to play another six games today.

4688
02:40:06,390 --> 02:40:07,790
Holy fuck, are you serious?

4689
02:40:08,190 --> 02:40:08,650
Yo!

4690
02:40:09,290 --> 02:40:09,770
Yo!

4691
02:40:12,650 --> 02:40:14,510
But we don't have to play tomorrow.

4692
02:40:15,550 --> 02:40:16,430
Oh, that's great.

4693
02:40:16,530 --> 02:40:16,670
Okay.

4694
02:40:16,690 --> 02:40:17,770
Yeah, we don't have to play tomorrow.

4695
02:40:17,990 --> 02:40:20,830
If we win those six games, by the way.

4696
02:40:20,830 --> 02:40:25,670
If we're top 10 in those six games, we don't have to play tomorrow.

4697
02:40:26,810 --> 02:40:27,990
All right, all right.

4698
02:40:27,990 --> 02:40:29,270
It's just like ALGS.

4699
02:40:29,550 --> 02:40:30,330
Isn't that great?

4700
02:40:31,470 --> 02:40:33,610
Wait, is tomorrow's like loser bracket, right?

4701
02:40:33,770 --> 02:40:34,870
Yeah, it's loser bracket.

4702
02:40:35,150 --> 02:40:35,630
Okay, okay, okay.

4703
02:40:35,690 --> 02:40:38,270
So as long as, you know, we win those six...

4704
02:40:38,270 --> 02:40:38,570
We do great.

4705
02:40:38,670 --> 02:40:40,070
We're not going to be playing again tomorrow.

4706
02:40:40,270 --> 02:40:41,450
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

4707
02:40:41,730 --> 02:40:42,170
Exactly.

4708
02:40:42,350 --> 02:40:44,070
So that's motivation, right, Flame?

4709
02:40:46,430 --> 02:40:47,870
Uh, I'm not gonna lie.

4710
02:40:48,380 --> 02:40:54,150
I have one review plan for like, uh, APMS GTs.

4711
02:40:54,170 --> 02:40:55,870
I have to cancel that first.

4712
02:40:55,950 --> 02:40:56,590
Give me one second.

4713
02:40:58,550 --> 02:41:00,190
Yeah, I thought we only had six games.

4714
02:41:00,190 --> 02:41:01,430
You're like, we have something more important.

4715
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,070
This is a lot more important.

4716
02:41:13,470 --> 02:41:14,390
That's fine.

4717
02:41:14,670 --> 02:41:16,650
I mean, it's a free trip to Japan, you know, just saying.

4718
02:41:16,650 --> 02:41:19,930
Yeah, it's a free trip to Japan, just saying.

4719
02:41:21,250 --> 02:41:23,430
I mean, you already got yourself booked in there, man.

4720
02:41:23,710 --> 02:41:25,170
I don't think you need this.

4721
02:41:28,550 --> 02:41:29,990
Wait, but what about us?

4722
02:41:30,030 --> 02:41:31,270
I thought we needed it.

4723
02:41:31,330 --> 02:41:33,430
I thought you were gonna do it for him.

4724
02:41:35,230 --> 02:41:35,950
Oh, yeah, you're right.

4725
02:41:36,930 --> 02:41:38,330
Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

4726
02:41:40,950 --> 02:41:42,190
My believing mechanic is like, wavering right now.

4727
02:41:42,190 --> 02:41:44,070
Yeah, I thought you wanted to do it for him.

4728
02:41:44,190 --> 02:41:44,770
What happened?

4729
02:41:44,850 --> 02:41:45,890
Yeah, I'm gonna do it for him.

4730
02:41:45,910 --> 02:41:46,330
I'm gonna.

4731
02:41:47,570 --> 02:41:48,290
Okay, cool.

4732
02:41:49,270 --> 02:41:52,210
Yeah, that's why we're gonna do great this time.

4733
02:41:52,490 --> 02:41:52,970
We're gonna do so well.

4734
02:41:53,090 --> 02:41:55,690
I mean, again, we're gonna do great again, so we don't have to play again tomorrow.

4735
02:41:57,270 --> 02:41:57,990
Exactly, exactly.

4736
02:41:58,170 --> 02:42:00,590
Yeah, we're gonna finish this thing in one fell swoop.

4737
02:42:00,630 --> 02:42:02,450
So we don't have to do anything anymore.

4738
02:42:03,290 --> 02:42:04,810
No, we still have to show up on day three.

4739
02:42:04,950 --> 02:42:09,630
If ever we do lose, if ever we do lose, like, um, what time?

4740
02:42:10,310 --> 02:42:11,230
Um, what time?

4741
02:42:11,310 --> 02:42:12,250
I think it's the same time.

4742
02:42:13,830 --> 02:42:14,330
I'm pretty sure.

4743
02:42:14,610 --> 02:42:14,790
Yeah.

4744
02:42:14,790 --> 02:42:15,670
Okay.

4745
02:42:15,750 --> 02:42:16,430
All right.

4746
02:42:16,450 --> 02:42:16,770
Okay.

4747
02:42:16,890 --> 02:42:17,870
It should be the same time.

4748
02:42:18,330 --> 02:42:22,230
We better not be there tomorrow because I have something important to do tomorrow.

4749
02:42:22,230 --> 02:42:23,250
Oh, yeah, yeah, you have.

4750
02:42:23,250 --> 02:42:23,590
Uh-oh.

4751
02:42:25,270 --> 02:42:27,470
I have a bunch of stuff that I need to do.

4752
02:42:27,490 --> 02:42:27,790
Yeah, you do.

4753
02:42:27,830 --> 02:42:29,530
So we better do great.

4754
02:42:29,810 --> 02:42:31,190
Flame, no pressure, Flame.

4755
02:42:31,450 --> 02:42:32,750
No pressure at all.

4756
02:42:33,250 --> 02:42:34,730
No pressure, no pressure.

4757
02:42:35,590 --> 02:42:39,110
If I miss tomorrow's something, it's all your fault.

4758
02:42:39,110 --> 02:42:40,270
Just saying.

4759
02:42:40,510 --> 02:42:41,650
No pressure, no pressure.

4760
02:42:42,010 --> 02:42:42,370
Whoa!

4761
02:42:43,230 --> 02:42:44,210
That's so fucked up!

4762
02:42:44,570 --> 02:42:47,430
I think I'm gonna play with a monitor turned off challenge, guys.

4763
02:42:49,190 --> 02:42:50,490
No, no, no, seriously, let's do it.

4764
02:42:50,530 --> 02:42:51,230
It's fine, it's fine, it's okay.

4765
02:42:51,230 --> 02:42:52,270
You think it's too easy?

4766
02:42:52,430 --> 02:42:52,970
No, you're right.

4767
02:42:53,050 --> 02:42:55,490
I should play with a computer turned off challenge.

4768
02:42:56,530 --> 02:42:57,250
Oh, no!

4769
02:42:59,030 --> 02:42:59,390
Bro!

4770
02:43:01,870 --> 02:43:03,590
Wait, wait, how many people are here left?

4771
02:43:03,790 --> 02:43:06,870
So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

4772
02:43:07,110 --> 02:43:08,330
Oh, wait, there's someone alone.

4773
02:43:08,830 --> 02:43:11,130
No, it's because the lobby, we're resetting.

4774
02:43:11,430 --> 02:43:12,570
We're waiting for the scores.

4775
02:43:13,410 --> 02:43:16,790
Yeah, we're waiting to know what group we're in.

4776
02:43:17,190 --> 02:43:17,770
Oh, we're fifth!

4777
02:43:18,930 --> 02:43:20,230
Yeah, we got fifth.

4778
02:43:20,230 --> 02:43:22,450
We got fifth, we're top five!

4779
02:43:23,790 --> 02:43:24,530
Let's go!

4780
02:43:26,270 --> 02:43:27,850
We won the tiebreaker?

4781
02:43:28,870 --> 02:43:30,190
We should have, we should have.

4782
02:43:30,190 --> 02:43:30,770
Yeah, we did!

4783
02:43:30,790 --> 02:43:31,690
We won with 11 kills.

4784
02:43:32,190 --> 02:43:34,990
Oh my god, we won the tiebreaker, that's crazy.

4785
02:43:37,250 --> 02:43:38,010
Whoa, insane!

4786
02:43:38,450 --> 02:43:39,810
Oh my god, we're top five.

4787
02:43:40,110 --> 02:43:40,490
Oh my god.

4788
02:43:40,490 --> 02:43:41,250
What does that mean?

4789
02:43:41,710 --> 02:43:44,110
So we're in the winner's bracket, so we gotta play six more games.

4790
02:43:44,270 --> 02:43:45,450
We won!

4791
02:43:48,090 --> 02:43:49,350
So we get to play!

4792
02:43:51,510 --> 02:43:51,690
No!

4793
02:43:52,910 --> 02:43:53,190
Yippee!

4794
02:43:55,810 --> 02:43:57,150
I don't hate this punishment.

4795
02:43:57,990 --> 02:43:59,830
Oh, it's even worse than I thought.

4796
02:43:59,970 --> 02:44:01,130
We're gonna be playing with these...

4797
02:44:01,130 --> 02:44:02,190
What do you mean?

4798
02:44:02,210 --> 02:44:03,030
These great people.

4799
02:44:03,490 --> 02:44:04,050
What do you mean?

4800
02:44:04,050 --> 02:44:10,050
So basically, we play against the other top 10, group B's top 10.

4801
02:44:10,110 --> 02:44:11,030
Oh god, that's even worse.

4802
02:44:11,190 --> 02:44:15,750
And then, so they're the... yeah, so then the lobbies are a little harder now.

4803
02:44:16,370 --> 02:44:17,910
Just a little bit harder.

4804
02:44:19,570 --> 02:44:22,210
But you're learning more in each game.

4805
02:44:23,370 --> 02:44:26,110
You're improving more in each game, so it should be easier.

4806
02:44:26,130 --> 02:44:27,550
Do you think we can secure another dub though?

4807
02:44:27,750 --> 02:44:28,310
I don't know.

4808
02:44:28,830 --> 02:44:29,950
We have to ask Flame that.

4809
02:44:30,050 --> 02:44:31,970
Flame, do you think we can secure another dub?

4810
02:44:32,150 --> 02:44:34,030
Do you think you can secure us a dub?

4811
02:44:34,050 --> 02:44:34,730
Flame.

4812
02:44:36,130 --> 02:44:39,930
Uh, I mean, people win the lottery sometimes.

4813
02:44:40,190 --> 02:44:40,410
WHAT?

4814
02:44:41,050 --> 02:44:43,070
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, YOU IDIOT?

4815
02:44:43,830 --> 02:44:44,290
YO!

4816
02:44:44,610 --> 02:44:45,910
At least it isn't zero!

4817
02:44:46,750 --> 02:44:47,210
Believe!

4818
02:44:48,450 --> 02:44:48,570
BELIEVE, FLAME!

4819
02:44:48,570 --> 02:44:50,910
The chances load a lot, man, you know.

4820
02:44:51,250 --> 02:44:53,510
It's not zero.

4821
02:44:54,530 --> 02:44:55,750
Gotta keep trying.

4822
02:44:56,070 --> 02:44:57,410
You're a real gambler like that.

4823
02:44:57,490 --> 02:44:58,650
I like that about you, man.

4824
02:44:59,210 --> 02:45:01,130
As long as it isn't zero, we're gonna keep going.

4825
02:45:01,650 --> 02:45:02,290
Is that true?

4826
02:45:02,290 --> 02:45:03,390
I mean, I don't have high hopes for us here.

4827
02:45:03,390 --> 02:45:05,890
It's gonna be so funny if we actually win this thing.

4828
02:45:07,970 --> 02:45:09,030
It would be pretty funny.

4829
02:45:09,030 --> 02:45:10,130
It would be pretty funny.

4830
02:45:10,290 --> 02:45:10,930
I had zero hopes for winning.

4831
02:45:10,930 --> 02:45:13,910
I'm not expecting us to win, but it would be really funny though.

4832
02:45:14,830 --> 02:45:18,010
It would be very, very funny.

4833
02:45:18,150 --> 02:45:26,930
Because all of us have, like, none of us are in Japan, so all of us have high ping in these lobbies, so it would be very funny.

4834
02:45:27,070 --> 02:45:31,610
The fact that we made it into the top 5 with our ping, like, I'm very, like...

4835
02:45:31,610 --> 02:45:34,790
Dude, a while ago at the first match, I was seeing you guys teleport.

4836
02:45:35,090 --> 02:45:37,870
I was like, oh my god, can I say this right now?

4837
02:45:39,410 --> 02:45:42,530
No, you should have not told me that, but that's okay.

4838
02:45:44,070 --> 02:45:44,870
That's okay.

4839
02:45:45,990 --> 02:45:54,330
Also, like, by the way, guys, there were scrims for this, but I figured, like, you know, I figured we were all busy for the scrim.

4840
02:45:57,230 --> 02:46:05,970
So, the fact that we got top 5 without, like, the scrims or anything, I'm really proud of us, honestly.

4841
02:46:06,750 --> 02:46:08,370
I'm really proud of us.

4842
02:46:08,370 --> 02:46:11,490
Yeah, I'm proud of whatever abomination we just did.

4843
02:46:11,490 --> 02:46:14,730
I can't believe we had scrims and you just decided, like, nah, I'm too good for this.

4844
02:46:14,750 --> 02:46:16,310
We didn't even have a third, Flame!

4845
02:46:16,770 --> 02:46:20,650
We didn't have a third!

4846
02:46:21,050 --> 02:46:22,850
I've been trying to find a third!

4847
02:46:24,330 --> 02:46:25,330
And you got me!

4848
02:46:25,630 --> 02:46:26,410
Yeah, we got Droid!

4849
02:46:27,870 --> 02:46:32,450
Would you really go to scrims when you had your own chat scrims to go to?

4850
02:46:34,130 --> 02:46:34,570
No.

4851
02:46:35,570 --> 02:46:37,850
Our teammate was going back from Thailand.

4852
02:46:39,230 --> 02:46:41,850
Oh, you don't have, so you can't do chat scrims?

4853
02:46:41,850 --> 02:46:42,310
You couldn't play.

4854
02:46:42,610 --> 02:46:44,330
Oh, so you would have used this as practice?

4855
02:46:44,450 --> 02:46:45,430
You could have said something!

4856
02:46:45,470 --> 02:46:46,610
Oh, you didn't even know, so...

4857
02:46:47,290 --> 02:46:48,810
Yes, that's the problem!

4858
02:46:49,490 --> 02:46:50,690
Nobody's informed me of this.

4859
02:46:50,790 --> 02:46:52,570
Nobody said, no, this scrim is good.

4860
02:46:54,330 --> 02:46:56,050
You didn't know, that's true.

4861
02:46:56,490 --> 02:47:02,390
I just made the executive decision for us that we didn't need it.

4862
02:47:02,530 --> 02:47:04,490
We were all too busy for scrims.

4863
02:47:08,270 --> 02:47:08,790
Unbelievable.

4864
02:47:09,970 --> 02:47:11,730
But we got top five!

4865
02:47:12,090 --> 02:47:13,370
Yeah, that's insane!

4866
02:47:14,330 --> 02:47:17,730
Without even informing anybody, we got top five.

4867
02:47:17,930 --> 02:47:20,050
Yeah, good job, everybody.

4868
02:47:20,230 --> 02:47:20,830
Good job.

4869
02:47:20,870 --> 02:47:21,330
Good job.

4870
02:47:21,430 --> 02:47:21,930
Good job.

4871
02:47:22,110 --> 02:47:22,950
Proud of us.

4872
02:47:23,030 --> 02:47:23,530
Proud of us.

4873
02:47:23,530 --> 02:47:28,090
I haven't touched Apex in a while, and we still got top five.

4874
02:47:35,670 --> 02:47:36,770
How long is this?

4875
02:47:36,830 --> 02:47:38,050
Because I don't want to...

4876
02:47:38,050 --> 02:47:38,910
I want to piss.

4877
02:47:39,130 --> 02:47:40,590
No, you can literally go pee right now.

4878
02:47:40,650 --> 02:47:42,510
We haven't drafted the POIs yet.

4879
02:47:42,770 --> 02:47:43,970
Okay, all right, I'll be right back.

4880
02:47:44,130 --> 02:47:47,190
We have to draft POIs for the next one.

4881
02:47:47,790 --> 02:47:48,570
Be right back.

4882
02:47:48,690 --> 02:47:49,610
Go pee.

4883
02:47:51,090 --> 02:47:52,270
All right, Flame, are you...

4884
02:47:52,270 --> 02:48:00,150
I don't know how to say this, you know, in a way that's not so rude.

4885
02:48:00,510 --> 02:48:04,130
But I think you should let me draft the POI.

4886
02:48:04,510 --> 02:48:07,590
I didn't draft it!

4887
02:48:07,710 --> 02:48:08,630
It was a sign!

4888
02:48:10,510 --> 02:48:11,550
It was a sign?

4889
02:48:11,730 --> 02:48:12,730
It was a sign!

4890
02:48:13,030 --> 02:48:16,090
No, yeah, but this time you can draft it.

4891
02:48:17,570 --> 02:48:20,190
I would have never picked Kosuke!

4892
02:48:20,190 --> 02:48:22,930
I know how dogshit Kosuke is!

4893
02:48:23,250 --> 02:48:27,110
I would have asked my friends to be like, which one are you?

4894
02:48:27,110 --> 02:48:28,970
I apologize, I was under the wrong impression.

4895
02:48:29,010 --> 02:48:31,530
I would be a little rude, but like, those jobs...

4896
02:48:32,250 --> 02:48:35,590
Wait, we still got top five with the dogshit drafts!

4897
02:48:35,690 --> 02:48:36,810
Just, I mean, come on!

4898
02:48:38,630 --> 02:48:41,450
Everything was against us, but we still did really well.

4899
02:48:42,210 --> 02:48:45,210
Imagine if we didn't have Kosuke, we would have come first, you know?

4900
02:48:45,210 --> 02:48:50,750
Yeah, but it wouldn't matter, because like, no, top ten, first in this part, it doesn't matter!

4901
02:48:51,990 --> 02:48:52,950
You don't get anything!

4902
02:48:52,950 --> 02:48:55,270
We get better drafts for winner's bracket, do we not?

4903
02:48:55,270 --> 02:48:55,790
Wait, do we?

4904
02:48:55,930 --> 02:48:56,610
I don't know.

4905
02:48:56,830 --> 02:48:57,850
I'm pretty sure that's how it works.

4906
02:48:58,130 --> 02:49:01,550
Oh, oh yeah, I mean, fifth place draft spot, that's...

4907
02:49:01,550 --> 02:49:03,390
Okay, wait, but then we have to...

4908
02:49:03,390 --> 02:49:05,790
Yeah, and then if we do better in winner's bracket, we get better drafts in finals.

4909
02:49:05,790 --> 02:49:07,910
That's true, that's true.

4910
02:49:09,050 --> 02:49:13,430
It's not like a massive advantage, but it is still a pretty good advantage.

4911
02:49:13,430 --> 02:49:14,250
Yay!

4912
02:49:16,830 --> 02:49:19,210
I'm so excited, I'm so excited.

4913
02:49:19,210 --> 02:49:22,610
He gave us coastal fragment, that is just like, not okay.

4914
02:49:23,130 --> 02:49:24,910
Yeah, to be fair.

4915
02:49:25,090 --> 02:49:27,330
I'm on, like, Cito, Cito landslide.

4916
02:49:29,350 --> 02:49:31,330
Like, that's literally my POI, man.

4917
02:49:32,010 --> 02:49:35,370
Well, you can try and get your POI, get your POI!

4918
02:49:36,930 --> 02:49:37,650
Yes, and then you can really...

4919
02:49:37,650 --> 02:49:38,690
Are they doing drafts now?

4920
02:49:39,090 --> 02:49:40,770
Because I have not been looking.

4921
02:49:40,770 --> 02:49:43,270
Oh, you can look at the, just ask in our channel.

4922
02:49:43,430 --> 02:49:45,210
To be like, how this draft works.

4923
02:49:45,910 --> 02:49:47,150
Because I don't know how they're...

4924
02:49:47,150 --> 02:49:49,990
Because I didn't think we'd make it this far, so I don't know how the drafting works.

4925
02:49:50,430 --> 02:49:50,810
Honestly.

4926
02:49:52,050 --> 02:49:53,870
I'm glad to know you had a lot of confidence.

4927
02:49:53,870 --> 02:49:56,270
You never had any hope for us actually winning.

4928
02:49:56,490 --> 02:49:59,050
I didn't, you know, I was so surprised.

4929
02:49:59,630 --> 02:50:01,130
Like, okay, you're right.

4930
02:50:01,510 --> 02:50:02,570
You be honest with me.

4931
02:50:02,650 --> 02:50:05,390
Do you really think we're going to get top 10 in the first?

4932
02:50:05,570 --> 02:50:05,850
No.

4933
02:50:08,350 --> 02:50:09,110
Exactly, exactly.

4934
02:50:09,410 --> 02:50:10,670
So I didn't...

4935
02:50:10,670 --> 02:50:12,070
I was going real hard.

4936
02:50:12,070 --> 02:50:16,330
Just maybe a little bit, but I didn't actually think it would manifest.

4937
02:50:19,070 --> 02:50:19,830
But we didn't go...

4938
02:50:19,830 --> 02:50:20,630
So what are the chances now?

4939
02:50:21,010 --> 02:50:24,150
Like, given our playthrough, do you think we can actually do this?

4940
02:50:27,810 --> 02:50:30,090
The chance is low, but not none.

4941
02:50:30,390 --> 02:50:30,990
Yeah, yeah.

4942
02:50:31,010 --> 02:50:33,930
As I've said, thank you for being consistent with me.

4943
02:50:33,990 --> 02:50:36,790
You had to think about it.

4944
02:50:37,230 --> 02:50:42,570
You thought about it for a while and be like, what do I say?

4945
02:50:44,490 --> 02:50:49,370
How do I break this unfortunate piece of news in a way where it's not...

4946
02:50:49,370 --> 02:50:49,850
Look, look, look, look.

4947
02:50:49,870 --> 02:50:54,570
You told me, you told me a while ago that we are not going to win.

4948
02:50:54,810 --> 02:50:56,510
Like, we would not do anything.

4949
02:50:56,630 --> 02:50:57,390
But look...

4950
02:50:57,390 --> 02:50:58,870
Wait, you said that to us?

4951
02:50:59,230 --> 02:51:00,190
We're top five.

4952
02:51:01,790 --> 02:51:03,830
I just realized I had no foogie on.

4953
02:51:03,870 --> 02:51:04,890
Realistically, and you said...

4954
02:51:05,910 --> 02:51:07,030
Oh, oh, you do.

4955
02:51:07,250 --> 02:51:08,630
You do have foogie.

4956
02:51:08,890 --> 02:51:09,450
No, I know.

4957
02:51:09,530 --> 02:51:12,150
I mean, I realized I didn't put it on my stream.

4958
02:51:12,150 --> 02:51:13,830
Oh, I'm sorry.

4959
02:51:14,910 --> 02:51:16,850
You must have been like, who the fuck is talking?

4960
02:51:17,170 --> 02:51:17,610
So that's what you meant.

4961
02:51:17,710 --> 02:51:20,490
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay, all right.

4962
02:51:20,510 --> 02:51:21,350
All right, what are you going to say?

4963
02:51:21,490 --> 02:51:24,050
What are you going to say, Gerard?

4964
02:51:25,710 --> 02:51:27,570
What are you going to say, Gerard, before I interrupt you?

4965
02:51:27,590 --> 02:51:28,730
I forgot what I was going to say.

4966
02:51:28,930 --> 02:51:29,630
Oh, sorry.

4967
02:51:29,990 --> 02:51:32,110
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

4968
02:51:32,270 --> 02:51:33,350
It's just my brain.

4969
02:51:34,570 --> 02:51:36,150
I know, I'm proud of us, though.

4970
02:51:36,250 --> 02:51:37,270
I'm so proud of us.

4971
02:51:37,310 --> 02:51:38,090
What number are we?

4972
02:51:38,290 --> 02:51:39,310
What team number are we?

4973
02:51:39,390 --> 02:51:40,710
I know, I know.

4974
02:51:40,710 --> 02:51:42,210
Uh, team eight.

4975
02:51:42,430 --> 02:51:45,510
Okay, team... where the fuck is team?

4976
02:51:45,570 --> 02:51:46,450
Oh, there it is.

4977
02:51:46,830 --> 02:51:47,170
All right.

4978
02:51:47,290 --> 02:51:48,610
We're team five, I think.

4979
02:51:49,530 --> 02:51:50,810
Oh, we're team five?

4980
02:51:51,610 --> 02:51:53,590
Yeah, we have to change discords, too.

4981
02:51:53,830 --> 02:51:54,850
You have to scroll down.

4982
02:51:55,130 --> 02:51:57,590
So in a giant map, like, oh, we're just going to be running...

4983
02:51:58,250 --> 02:52:00,090
finding these, um, like how many?

4984
02:52:00,230 --> 02:52:01,510
Yeah, yeah, okay, okay.

4985
02:52:02,090 --> 02:52:03,370
What is my teammate?

4986
02:52:03,630 --> 02:52:04,230
There's so many...

4987
02:52:04,870 --> 02:52:06,130
Wait, what do you mean teammates?

4988
02:52:06,890 --> 02:52:09,550
I'm like... I'm like looking through...

4989
02:52:09,550 --> 02:52:11,370
Oh my god, I'm looking through, like, the...

4990
02:52:12,330 --> 02:52:14,130
Discord overlay and streamer kit.

4991
02:52:14,430 --> 02:52:16,890
And if you look at that, there's so many teams.

4992
02:52:17,150 --> 02:52:18,670
There's, like, several teammates.

4993
02:52:18,850 --> 02:52:20,370
So I'm like, which one's my teammate?

4994
02:52:21,430 --> 02:52:21,970
Is it this one?

4995
02:52:22,130 --> 02:52:24,510
There's, like, a drop-down that says what it is.

4996
02:52:24,650 --> 02:52:27,310
Like, winners round, losers round, group B.

4997
02:52:27,910 --> 02:52:28,330
You see that?

4998
02:52:28,410 --> 02:52:29,270
Are we group stage?

4999
02:52:29,410 --> 02:52:29,930
Okay, teammate.

5000
02:52:30,730 --> 02:52:31,670
Oh, that's not it.

5001
02:52:32,370 --> 02:52:34,810
We're looking for team five for winners.

5002
02:52:35,290 --> 02:52:35,590
Okay.

5003
02:52:36,090 --> 02:52:38,350
No, we're team... we're on channel eight right now, so...

5004
02:52:39,110 --> 02:52:41,230
Yeah, but they moved us to five.

5005
02:52:41,430 --> 02:52:43,090
Oh, okay, they're moving us there.

5006
02:52:43,090 --> 02:52:48,550
Okay, I'm gonna look at all the teammates for now and I'll find five later.

5007
02:52:49,070 --> 02:52:51,430
I'm trying to find our icons in team eight.

5008
02:52:51,550 --> 02:52:53,850
Oh my god, why is there so many numbers?

5009
02:52:54,870 --> 02:52:57,110
I honestly don't know what you're looking at.

5010
02:52:57,290 --> 02:52:57,430
Like...

5011
02:52:57,430 --> 02:52:58,590
Oh, like, okay, so...

5012
02:52:58,590 --> 02:52:59,170
Is it in Discord?

5013
02:52:59,550 --> 02:53:02,810
No, I'm using the streamer kit, the stream kit Discord overlay.

5014
02:53:03,170 --> 02:53:06,990
And then, like, when you do the drop-down, it tells you, like, what the voice channels are.

5015
02:53:06,990 --> 02:53:13,510
But, like, there's so many hidden voice channels that we don't have access to, but it shows it to me on this.

5016
02:53:13,870 --> 02:53:19,510
It shows it to me.

5017
02:53:19,810 --> 02:53:20,970
So, basically...

5018
02:53:20,970 --> 02:53:22,550
Okay, I'm gonna post it in the Doki.

5019
02:53:22,770 --> 02:53:25,070
They're gonna... the staff is gonna be, like, what the...

5020
02:53:25,070 --> 02:53:25,430
Oh, wait.

5021
02:53:26,950 --> 02:53:28,490
Oh, they translated it for us.

5022
02:53:29,150 --> 02:53:30,730
We'll be holding after...

5023
02:53:30,730 --> 02:53:31,310
Oh, thank god.

5024
02:53:31,810 --> 02:53:32,170
1950.

5025
02:53:32,690 --> 02:53:33,810
Therefore, we're like, please decide.

5026
02:53:34,150 --> 02:53:35,330
Oh, okay, you got...

5027
02:53:35,330 --> 02:53:36,450
They told you how to do it.

5028
02:53:39,030 --> 02:53:40,990
Okay, so, uh...

5029
02:53:40,990 --> 02:53:42,270
You have to be at that channel.

5030
02:53:42,730 --> 02:53:45,550
My POI draft is supposed to happen right now.

5031
02:53:45,710 --> 02:53:47,670
Yeah, yeah, go to your... this channel.

5032
02:53:47,870 --> 02:53:48,630
Goodbye, Flame.

5033
02:53:50,210 --> 02:53:51,070
Which channel?

5034
02:53:51,410 --> 02:53:52,590
The... you click on it.

5035
02:53:52,770 --> 02:53:53,830
You just click on the thing.

5036
02:53:54,670 --> 02:53:54,970
Oh.

5037
02:53:55,230 --> 02:53:56,370
Oh, I need to write it.

5038
02:53:56,470 --> 02:53:57,310
Oh, representative.

5039
02:53:58,870 --> 02:54:03,690
Strafing Flame is representative for Doki Bird.

5040
02:54:05,450 --> 02:54:06,530
Oh, what's gonna happen?

5041
02:54:06,530 --> 02:54:07,510
Oh, shit, where'd it go?

5042
02:54:07,630 --> 02:54:08,470
They're getting the draft.

5043
02:54:08,630 --> 02:54:09,650
They're drafting it.

5044
02:54:11,030 --> 02:54:12,410
Oh, how does that work?

5045
02:54:12,890 --> 02:54:14,550
There is, like, two people in there.

5046
02:54:14,870 --> 02:54:16,130
There's, like, two people in there.

5047
02:54:16,210 --> 02:54:17,830
You're like, I don't want to be there by myself.

5048
02:54:22,970 --> 02:54:24,230
This is what it looks like.

5049
02:54:24,270 --> 02:54:27,170
So, I'm, like, trying to find it and I'm like, this is not my teammate.

5050
02:54:29,170 --> 02:54:31,330
Like, there's so many numbers in this area.

5051
02:54:31,550 --> 02:54:32,630
Which one's mine?

5052
02:54:34,670 --> 02:54:35,330
Oh, there is.

5053
02:54:35,410 --> 02:54:35,950
I found mine.

5054
02:54:36,770 --> 02:54:37,810
Yeah, it is.

5055
02:54:37,930 --> 02:54:40,130
I realized I never had a Fugi on here.

5056
02:54:40,170 --> 02:54:41,750
And I'm like, oops, sorry, guys.

5057
02:54:42,050 --> 02:54:43,710
I guess you're not gonna see anybody.

5058
02:54:44,570 --> 02:54:45,690
My bad.

5059
02:54:46,610 --> 02:54:47,170
Okay.

5060
02:54:48,690 --> 02:54:50,490
Okay, this should work now.

5061
02:54:50,950 --> 02:54:51,670
There we go.

5062
02:54:54,190 --> 02:54:56,510
You fucking icon, Gerard.

5063
02:54:57,350 --> 02:54:58,630
What's wrong with it?

5064
02:54:58,990 --> 02:55:00,270
It's so dumb.

5065
02:55:01,290 --> 02:55:02,030
It's cute.

5066
02:55:04,270 --> 02:55:06,030
And then Flame is just a dog.

5067
02:55:06,030 --> 02:55:08,250
I'm not judging anybody's fucking icon, bro.

5068
02:55:09,190 --> 02:55:10,570
Mine was made of love.

5069
02:55:10,910 --> 02:55:11,530
I made it.

5070
02:55:11,650 --> 02:55:13,790
Like, very first time in debut, I made it.

5071
02:55:14,170 --> 02:55:14,910
My own Fugi.

5072
02:55:17,270 --> 02:55:19,070
I appreciate myself, bro.

5073
02:55:19,950 --> 02:55:21,590
All right, I finally found it.

5074
02:55:21,650 --> 02:55:25,550
Okay, so you can check the status of each team's declaration in the dedicated spreadsheet.

5075
02:55:25,830 --> 02:55:26,830
Oh, there's a spreadsheet.

5076
02:55:27,750 --> 02:55:28,170
Yeah.

5077
02:55:28,570 --> 02:55:30,290
Okay, we are ninth pick.

5078
02:55:30,770 --> 02:55:31,770
That's not bad.

5079
02:55:32,550 --> 02:55:34,130
They first picked Klimatizer?

5080
02:55:34,270 --> 02:55:34,950
That's crazy.

5081
02:55:36,070 --> 02:55:37,690
Oh, is it bad?

5082
02:55:37,870 --> 02:55:40,310
Like, are the items usually that bad?

5083
02:55:41,410 --> 02:55:43,430
It's just not first pick POIs.

5084
02:55:43,470 --> 02:55:45,010
Yeah, it's not a first pick POI.

5085
02:55:45,290 --> 02:55:46,450
Oh, bro.

5086
02:55:48,090 --> 02:55:51,510
Go up to the, like, that's a crazy POI thing.

5087
02:55:54,310 --> 02:55:54,750
Damn.

5088
02:56:01,400 --> 02:56:04,320
I feel like if you're gonna go Klimatizer, you just go SkyWest.

5089
02:56:06,260 --> 02:56:08,020
It's just, like, so much better.

5090
02:56:09,020 --> 02:56:12,880
Let's see, when it comes to the order of nomination, we will move you to standby and then to the caster.

5091
02:56:13,020 --> 02:56:13,520
Please declare.

5092
02:56:13,620 --> 02:56:15,460
Oh, you're gonna be on the main stream.

5093
02:56:15,780 --> 02:56:18,900
You're gonna, you're gonna, like, you're just gonna be, like, this.

5094
02:56:19,020 --> 02:56:24,660
And then you're gonna be, like, there'll be, like, the one person speaking English after.

5095
02:56:27,540 --> 02:56:28,780
How does that work?

5096
02:56:29,720 --> 02:56:30,980
You just declare it.

5097
02:56:31,100 --> 02:56:33,180
I think, I think it's, like, direct trans.

5098
02:56:33,240 --> 02:56:34,480
Like, I mean, Klimatizer?

5099
02:56:35,380 --> 02:56:38,200
Yeah, all I have to say is, like, Cito Station.

5100
02:56:38,240 --> 02:56:38,720
Yeah.

5101
02:56:50,280 --> 02:56:52,860
I don't know, that kind of sounds like a racist.

5102
02:56:53,920 --> 02:56:59,000
There's, like, Japanese words that, like, are, like, phonetic to English words.

5103
02:56:59,960 --> 02:57:01,620
Checkpoint is one of them.

5104
02:57:01,900 --> 02:57:04,320
My experience at Doki Bird.

5105
02:57:08,320 --> 02:57:08,880
It's true!

5106
02:57:10,660 --> 02:57:13,000
I'm gonna see how he pronounces checkpoint.

5107
02:57:13,220 --> 02:57:18,300
It's so, it's, checkpoint is one of the Japanese words that sound like an English word.

5108
02:57:19,820 --> 02:57:21,940
Oh, you can't pull this on me.

5109
02:57:22,120 --> 02:57:22,460
You can't.

5110
02:57:24,160 --> 02:57:25,580
Uh-oh, looks like we're getting cancelled.

5111
02:57:25,900 --> 02:57:27,580
It's checkpointo!

5112
02:57:28,420 --> 02:57:29,460
It is!

5113
02:57:29,560 --> 02:57:32,180
Oh my gosh, it literally is!

5114
02:57:32,340 --> 02:57:32,860
It does!

5115
02:57:34,320 --> 02:57:35,600
And I'm gaslighting you.

5116
02:57:36,240 --> 02:57:38,260
You're the racist one!

5117
02:57:42,920 --> 02:57:43,520
Oh,

5118
02:57:51,760 --> 02:57:52,040
well.

5119
02:57:52,540 --> 02:57:54,480
I fucking knew it.

5120
02:57:54,960 --> 02:57:57,880
I was like, there's no way I'm wrong.

5121
02:57:58,040 --> 02:57:59,800
There's no way.

5122
02:58:00,040 --> 02:58:03,960
Is it, wait, is it in, like, um, English alphabet or what?

5123
02:58:04,320 --> 02:58:05,980
It's literally checkpointo.

5124
02:58:06,020 --> 02:58:08,120
And I was like, checkpoint, checkpointo.

5125
02:58:08,240 --> 02:58:12,080
And then I was like, I'm pretty sure it was actually how it's pronounced.

5126
02:58:12,900 --> 02:58:14,220
I mean, yeah, that's right.

5127
02:58:14,300 --> 02:58:15,300
That is what it is.

5128
02:58:15,320 --> 02:58:17,360
Yes, and then he called me racist.

5129
02:58:17,920 --> 02:58:20,000
I was literally reading it.

5130
02:58:22,780 --> 02:58:24,080
My God, my God.

5131
02:58:24,080 --> 02:58:26,500
We're already throwing fucking racist cards.

5132
02:58:26,780 --> 02:58:27,680
I can't believe it.

5133
02:58:27,720 --> 02:58:30,620
And I was like, no, this is not checkpointo.

5134
02:58:30,940 --> 02:58:33,120
I was like, did I just make that up?

5135
02:58:34,620 --> 02:58:36,660
I have no idea what you guys are looking at.

5136
02:58:36,740 --> 02:58:37,780
Where are you guys looking at that?

5137
02:58:37,780 --> 02:58:38,340
I'm looking at the spreadsheet.

5138
02:58:38,680 --> 02:58:39,800
Okay, here's, I'll link it to you.

5139
02:58:39,820 --> 02:58:41,700
It's in the, it's in the...

5140
02:58:41,700 --> 02:58:42,700
Is it in Japanese or is it...

5141
02:58:42,700 --> 02:58:44,460
No, it's in the, no, it's in the channel.

5142
02:58:44,560 --> 02:58:45,760
So we could see what they're picking.

5143
02:58:46,420 --> 02:58:49,900
It's in the, um, the top 20, like...

5144
02:58:49,900 --> 02:58:51,640
Holy shit, you guys are looking at these documents?

5145
02:58:52,060 --> 02:58:54,940
Yeah, we're looking at exclusive documents right now.

5146
02:58:55,600 --> 02:58:56,660
Oh, okay, okay.

5147
02:58:57,360 --> 02:58:58,660
So where the fuck did you read?

5148
02:58:58,780 --> 02:59:00,260
Uh, thermal station, uh...

5149
02:59:00,260 --> 02:59:02,540
No, I'm literally looking at checkpointo.

5150
02:59:02,540 --> 02:59:05,080
I'm literally looking at this.

5151
02:59:06,040 --> 02:59:07,380
It's the first one.

5152
02:59:07,400 --> 02:59:07,980
You're right.

5153
02:59:08,300 --> 02:59:09,320
No, yeah, you're right.

5154
02:59:09,460 --> 02:59:11,880
It is checkpointo.

5155
02:59:12,380 --> 02:59:18,580
Yes, but oh, I get called racist for reading the fucking characters.

5156
02:59:21,140 --> 02:59:21,520
I mean, uh...

5157
02:59:21,520 --> 02:59:23,340
Did you really say checkpointo?

5158
02:59:23,400 --> 02:59:25,220
I'm like, yes, because that's what it says.

5159
02:59:26,380 --> 02:59:28,920
I'm going to make the twit longer now, Gerard.

5160
02:59:29,340 --> 02:59:32,140
I'm going to make the twit longer.

5161
02:59:32,140 --> 02:59:33,780
No, don't cancel each other, no!

5162
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:35,160
We just literally...

5163
02:59:35,160 --> 02:59:38,640
There's a little first calamity where someone's going to get cancelled already.

5164
02:59:38,700 --> 02:59:41,980
We're going to make sure we don't get top 10, so you got to cancel.

5165
02:59:45,100 --> 02:59:45,900
Yeah, come...

5166
02:59:45,900 --> 02:59:46,840
No, fuck's sake.

5167
02:59:48,980 --> 02:59:52,080
My God, I think this is going to take a little longer.

5168
02:59:52,640 --> 02:59:53,760
Is it going to take a little longer?

5169
02:59:54,160 --> 02:59:58,700
Well, this is going to be another, uh, two and a half hours.

5170
02:59:59,840 --> 03:00:00,300
Two and a half hours?

5171
03:00:00,400 --> 03:00:01,160
Oh, God.

5172
03:00:01,280 --> 03:00:01,880
Yeah, I mean...

5173
03:00:01,880 --> 03:00:03,940
That's what we get for winning, Gerard.

5174
03:00:04,120 --> 03:00:04,820
That's what we get.

5175
03:00:05,720 --> 03:00:08,420
Okay, now I kind of regret a little bit, but we might win, though.

5176
03:00:08,440 --> 03:00:09,880
You regret a little bit?

5177
03:00:09,900 --> 03:00:12,020
I thought this was the best day of your life.

5178
03:00:12,060 --> 03:00:13,160
I know, it is the best.

5179
03:00:13,200 --> 03:00:14,160
It is the best day.

5180
03:00:14,180 --> 03:00:15,260
It is the best day of my life.

5181
03:00:15,400 --> 03:00:15,700
What happened?

5182
03:00:15,900 --> 03:00:19,300
But, like, I didn't expect we'd be going for long, but it's okay.

5183
03:00:19,480 --> 03:00:20,220
I didn't either.

5184
03:00:20,800 --> 03:00:22,740
That's why I was like, don't worry, it's okay.

5185
03:00:22,900 --> 03:00:25,680
I didn't expect it either, because I didn't think we were going to get top 10.

5186
03:00:25,960 --> 03:00:27,120
But now we're here.

5187
03:00:29,940 --> 03:00:30,620
But it's...

5188
03:00:30,620 --> 03:00:31,300
It's fine.

5189
03:00:31,900 --> 03:00:32,560
It's fine.

5190
03:00:32,600 --> 03:00:32,960
It's fine.

5191
03:00:33,140 --> 03:00:34,540
Like, what's your longest stream, anyway?

5192
03:00:34,800 --> 03:00:35,580
My longest stream?

5193
03:00:36,040 --> 03:00:37,400
11... almost 12 hours.

5194
03:00:37,600 --> 03:00:39,120
Oh, wait, no, past 12 hours.

5195
03:00:39,200 --> 03:00:40,180
I think, like, 14 hours.

5196
03:00:40,500 --> 03:00:40,580
Holy crap.

5197
03:00:41,540 --> 03:00:42,200
Yeah, me too.

5198
03:00:42,260 --> 03:00:43,920
I've been going for fucking 11 hours.

5199
03:00:43,960 --> 03:00:44,860
I can take this thing on.

5200
03:00:45,300 --> 03:00:45,720
I can do this.

5201
03:00:45,720 --> 03:00:46,380
You can do it.

5202
03:00:46,580 --> 03:00:48,320
Each game you're getting better, remember.

5203
03:00:48,520 --> 03:00:49,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5204
03:00:50,380 --> 03:00:51,700
Yeah, I gotta remember it.

5205
03:00:51,760 --> 03:00:54,820
Like, are we still gonna go, by the way, with the regular setup?

5206
03:00:55,400 --> 03:00:56,220
With the regular setup?

5207
03:00:56,220 --> 03:00:56,680
With these people?

5208
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:57,480
Well, yeah.

5209
03:00:59,660 --> 03:01:00,140
Yeah, yeah.

5210
03:01:00,140 --> 03:01:00,900
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

5211
03:01:00,920 --> 03:01:01,580
I thought we were gonna...

5212
03:01:01,580 --> 03:01:02,020
Yeah.

5213
03:01:02,500 --> 03:01:03,260
Better not fucking...

5214
03:01:03,260 --> 03:01:05,160
I swear to god, I better not fuck this up.

5215
03:01:05,320 --> 03:01:06,060
I better not.

5216
03:01:06,400 --> 03:01:09,180
Like, I gotta show for something, at least.

5217
03:01:09,420 --> 03:01:11,580
Like, I'm getting better and better, gotta say.

5218
03:01:11,680 --> 03:01:12,020
Getting better and better.

5219
03:01:12,040 --> 03:01:13,160
You're getting better and better.

5220
03:01:13,600 --> 03:01:14,780
I gotta also be careful.

5221
03:01:15,440 --> 03:01:18,520
Because I don't wanna be the first down again, I swear.

5222
03:01:19,180 --> 03:01:20,880
Who else would be the first down?

5223
03:01:23,240 --> 03:01:25,480
I am the only bronze player out here.

5224
03:01:25,840 --> 03:01:27,000
I don't wanna be at lea...

5225
03:01:27,460 --> 03:01:28,520
Go, go, go, go.

5226
03:01:28,980 --> 03:01:32,180
Like, hey, hey, did you know, did you know, by the way, I killed, like, one...

5227
03:01:32,180 --> 03:01:33,100
I killed, like, two people.

5228
03:01:33,680 --> 03:01:35,760
Wait, that's, like, double what you wanted.

5229
03:01:36,740 --> 03:01:37,080
Yeah!

5230
03:01:37,380 --> 03:01:40,840
You were like, I hope I get, like, one kill.

5231
03:01:40,960 --> 03:01:42,140
But you already got two.

5232
03:01:42,960 --> 03:01:44,480
Yeah, correct me if I'm wrong.

5233
03:01:44,720 --> 03:01:45,540
I'm like, you know...

5234
03:01:45,540 --> 03:01:46,080
You got...

5235
03:01:46,080 --> 03:01:47,600
Oh, nice!

5236
03:01:47,780 --> 03:01:48,520
Cito Station!

5237
03:01:49,380 --> 03:01:49,800
Let's go.

5238
03:01:49,800 --> 03:01:50,300
Is that good?

5239
03:01:50,380 --> 03:01:50,840
Is that good?

5240
03:01:51,100 --> 03:01:51,480
Yes.

5241
03:01:51,820 --> 03:01:52,480
That's his...

5242
03:01:52,480 --> 03:01:54,260
That's literally his ALGS land spot.

5243
03:01:55,480 --> 03:01:57,480
So he knows exactly how to play.

5244
03:01:58,380 --> 03:01:59,320
Now we have to win.

5245
03:01:59,840 --> 03:02:01,360
Usually, like, the top three pick.

5246
03:02:01,660 --> 03:02:02,420
I don't know.

5247
03:02:02,440 --> 03:02:03,100
Oh, my God.

5248
03:02:03,240 --> 03:02:03,440
Oh, my God.

5249
03:02:03,440 --> 03:02:05,020
I don't know what's going on with this draft.

5250
03:02:05,120 --> 03:02:07,700
Well, to be fair, you're the only ALGS player in here.

5251
03:02:08,400 --> 03:02:08,800
What, am I?

5252
03:02:09,220 --> 03:02:09,840
You have to be.

5253
03:02:10,760 --> 03:02:10,940
You're the only...

5254
03:02:10,940 --> 03:02:12,280
Like, we were so lucky.

5255
03:02:12,800 --> 03:02:14,620
That's FD on Mainy.

5256
03:02:14,700 --> 03:02:15,220
Yeah, but...

5257
03:02:15,220 --> 03:02:15,980
Oh, wait, there's FD...

5258
03:02:15,980 --> 03:02:16,580
Oh, shit.

5259
03:02:16,680 --> 03:02:17,140
I mean, those...

5260
03:02:17,140 --> 03:02:18,420
But I was gonna say Group A.

5261
03:02:18,680 --> 03:02:18,840
Nah.

5262
03:02:20,180 --> 03:02:26,840
Not gonna jinx it or anything, but the moment when Doki just said that she was, like, very professional at, like, the world's edge.

5263
03:02:27,200 --> 03:02:29,040
And now you're very good at this map.

5264
03:02:29,040 --> 03:02:30,020
So I think we're gonna win again.

5265
03:02:30,060 --> 03:02:30,640
We're gonna win again.

5266
03:02:30,640 --> 03:02:34,320
Yeah, now that we have you on Stormpoint on Cetus Station, it'll be fun.

5267
03:02:35,080 --> 03:02:36,240
Yeah, we're gonna win.

5268
03:02:36,880 --> 03:02:37,420
This is it.

5269
03:02:37,700 --> 03:02:38,540
We're not gonna jinx it.

5270
03:02:38,760 --> 03:02:39,460
This is a declaration.

5271
03:02:39,620 --> 03:02:40,540
Oh, my God, Flame.

5272
03:02:40,860 --> 03:02:43,320
That means we placed higher than FD on.

5273
03:02:44,100 --> 03:02:44,720
We did?

5274
03:02:44,940 --> 03:02:46,980
Yeah, because they got 60 to pick.

5275
03:02:47,860 --> 03:02:48,620
Oh, yeah.

5276
03:02:48,880 --> 03:02:49,520
They got 60.

5277
03:02:49,680 --> 03:02:50,320
Oh, my God.

5278
03:02:50,380 --> 03:02:51,740
I'm so proud of us, guys.

5279
03:02:51,920 --> 03:02:52,600
I'm so proud.

5280
03:02:52,620 --> 03:02:52,900
Oh, my God.

5281
03:02:52,960 --> 03:02:54,040
Are they actually that correct?

5282
03:02:54,340 --> 03:02:54,740
They are.

5283
03:02:54,840 --> 03:02:55,140
They are.

5284
03:02:55,460 --> 03:02:55,980
And they're...

5285
03:02:56,740 --> 03:02:57,280
You're right.

5286
03:02:57,360 --> 03:02:59,860
The thing is, all these players, except for us...

5287
03:03:00,700 --> 03:03:02,840
And no, not all of them, because I don't think it's not.

5288
03:03:03,100 --> 03:03:06,980
Majority of these players are in Japan, playing in Japanese servers.

5289
03:03:07,560 --> 03:03:11,140
I get 100 ping, 120 ping.

5290
03:03:11,780 --> 03:03:12,720
Oh, my God.

5291
03:03:12,820 --> 03:03:13,540
Holy crap.

5292
03:03:13,680 --> 03:03:14,860
I can't believe we did it.

5293
03:03:15,360 --> 03:03:16,080
Holy shit.

5294
03:03:17,040 --> 03:03:21,620
And then none of us are in Japan, so we all have ping diff right now.

5295
03:03:21,820 --> 03:03:24,460
We have a ping disadvantage and we still managed to reach it this far.

5296
03:03:24,620 --> 03:03:25,220
Holy shit.

5297
03:03:25,780 --> 03:03:27,120
It's pretty good for us.

5298
03:03:27,120 --> 03:03:28,580
This is actually really good.

5299
03:03:35,120 --> 03:03:36,680
I'm fucking hyped.

5300
03:03:36,880 --> 03:03:37,740
I'm fucking hyped.

5301
03:03:37,780 --> 03:03:41,040
I should be, like, fucking nervous right now, but I'm actually hyped.

5302
03:03:41,640 --> 03:03:44,560
I'm actually running through my adrenaline.

5303
03:03:45,560 --> 03:03:46,500
Like, this is a good thing.

5304
03:03:47,320 --> 03:03:49,100
We still have to wait for it.

5305
03:03:49,140 --> 03:03:51,840
We're still waiting for the draft fix.

5306
03:03:53,060 --> 03:03:54,080
It's fine.

5307
03:03:54,380 --> 03:03:54,920
It's fine.

5308
03:03:55,460 --> 03:03:55,860
Optimism.

5309
03:03:55,940 --> 03:03:57,760
I wonder how we're gonna do the Worlds...

5310
03:03:57,760 --> 03:03:58,940
Or is it going up?

5311
03:03:59,040 --> 03:03:59,440
Down?

5312
03:04:00,660 --> 03:04:01,480
Or, like, down-up?

5313
03:04:01,660 --> 03:04:02,740
Is that how the draft works?

5314
03:04:03,240 --> 03:04:04,280
For the other ones?

5315
03:04:04,740 --> 03:04:05,060
Okay.

5316
03:04:05,400 --> 03:04:07,900
Okay, so we don't get good picks for Worlds Edge.

5317
03:04:09,240 --> 03:04:13,300
Nah, we're at, like, 30th pick on Worlds Edge, but it should be okay.

5318
03:04:13,680 --> 03:04:15,320
Well, 30th pick isn't that bad.

5319
03:04:16,160 --> 03:04:17,520
So we should just not even be...

5320
03:04:17,520 --> 03:04:20,540
We should've just been, like, 8th place, just to have the middle.

5321
03:04:25,760 --> 03:04:27,060
Oh, should've been...

5322
03:04:27,060 --> 03:04:27,060
Wait, what?

5323
03:04:27,540 --> 03:04:30,980
8th place puts us at the 32nd...

5324
03:04:31,620 --> 03:04:31,920
Wait.

5325
03:04:32,640 --> 03:04:35,160
If we were in the middle, then we would have been, like...

5326
03:04:35,160 --> 03:04:37,120
We don't have to worry about the picks too much.

5327
03:04:37,640 --> 03:04:38,840
I mean, I guess we got Ceedo.

5328
03:04:39,960 --> 03:04:41,800
We get the idea of Ceedo Station.

5329
03:04:42,220 --> 03:04:43,200
I mean, what the fuck is Ceedo?

5330
03:04:43,200 --> 03:04:46,220
I mean, the higher up you go, the better.

5331
03:04:46,320 --> 03:04:46,900
Because it doesn't...

5332
03:04:46,900 --> 03:04:47,760
It doesn't go like that.

5333
03:04:47,880 --> 03:04:48,300
It's not draft.

5334
03:04:48,420 --> 03:04:48,840
It goes...

5335
03:04:52,080 --> 03:04:52,500
Um...

5336
03:04:53,240 --> 03:04:56,420
Like, the first person to pick is the 21st person to pick.

5337
03:04:56,660 --> 03:04:57,640
Oh, okay.

5338
03:04:57,780 --> 03:04:57,960
Yeah.

5339
03:04:59,040 --> 03:05:02,140
So if we get, like, 5th place, we would be 25th pick.

5340
03:05:02,380 --> 03:05:03,680
If we were at 9th place, we would be 9th pick.

5341
03:05:03,680 --> 03:05:05,680
Oh, okay, so we still get good picks then.

5342
03:05:06,200 --> 03:05:06,400
Woo!

5343
03:05:11,180 --> 03:05:11,920
All right, guys.

5344
03:05:11,960 --> 03:05:12,560
More Apex.

5345
03:05:14,860 --> 03:05:16,540
Yeah, this is taking a while.

5346
03:05:16,720 --> 03:05:18,840
Sounds like you were held at gunpoint.

5347
03:05:19,260 --> 03:05:22,280
Let me put a Marvel Rivals on this.

5348
03:05:22,320 --> 03:05:22,900
Get the Marvel Rivals.

5349
03:05:22,900 --> 03:05:23,440
Let's go, let's go.

5350
03:05:24,960 --> 03:05:26,520
Crouching your forearm like a drug addict.

5351
03:05:26,960 --> 03:05:29,180
Yeah, I guess we'll play Marvel Rivals.

5352
03:05:29,480 --> 03:05:31,680
Yes, just a quick game.

5353
03:05:31,680 --> 03:05:32,760
We can play, like, while we're waiting.

5354
03:05:33,280 --> 03:05:33,820
Oh my god.

5355
03:05:33,880 --> 03:05:34,860
Oh, wait, we could do a pub.

5356
03:05:35,160 --> 03:05:35,700
Let's do a pub.

5357
03:05:36,020 --> 03:05:37,160
Yeah, just pubs.

5358
03:05:37,200 --> 03:05:38,840
Yeah, let's do a pub.

5359
03:05:38,940 --> 03:05:39,620
We might as well.

5360
03:05:39,700 --> 03:05:40,800
Okay, I don't have you guys.

5361
03:05:41,400 --> 03:05:43,680
Wait, let me give you my...

5362
03:05:43,680 --> 03:05:44,220
What's my...

5363
03:05:44,220 --> 03:05:46,440
I'm back in the lobby so we can send you a friend request.

5364
03:05:46,580 --> 03:05:47,840
Yeah, I'm gonna...

5365
03:05:48,460 --> 03:05:50,160
Wait, are you actually...

5366
03:05:50,160 --> 03:05:50,780
Yeah, let's do a pub.

5367
03:05:50,860 --> 03:05:52,020
No, George, we need a pub.

5368
03:05:52,200 --> 03:05:54,160
We're, like, worn down.

5369
03:05:56,320 --> 03:05:59,220
We don't start our matches until 25 minutes.

5370
03:05:59,360 --> 03:06:00,840
I think we can fit in a pub.

5371
03:06:01,980 --> 03:06:04,220
All right, I'll put in the DokiBit channel.

5372
03:06:04,800 --> 03:06:07,420
That's my Steam friend number.

5373
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:12,120
All right, let's get a pub going in.

5374
03:06:12,180 --> 03:06:14,120
I'll put us on JP servers too.

5375
03:06:15,080 --> 03:06:15,780
All right, okay.

5376
03:06:17,840 --> 03:06:19,140
So, like, we get the...

5377
03:06:19,140 --> 03:06:19,580
Very nice.

5378
03:06:19,900 --> 03:06:22,320
We get the Tokyo experience.

5379
03:06:23,760 --> 03:06:26,760
JP pub servers are kind of brutal, I can't lie.

5380
03:06:26,860 --> 03:06:30,380
No, I think all pubs are pretty fucking brutal.

5381
03:06:31,020 --> 03:06:32,640
I'm pretty sure all pubs are, like...

5382
03:06:32,640 --> 03:06:35,720
People are saying that rank is more chill than pubs now.

5383
03:06:36,800 --> 03:06:38,260
Yeah, it probably is.

5384
03:06:38,740 --> 03:06:40,780
Because, like, everybody's just doing movement shit.

5385
03:06:41,080 --> 03:06:41,840
Where is...

5386
03:06:41,840 --> 03:06:43,540
Guys, where is the friend request, guys?

5387
03:06:43,800 --> 03:06:44,220
Oh, there...

5388
03:06:44,220 --> 03:06:45,860
Yeah, I'm trying to, uh...

5389
03:06:45,860 --> 03:06:46,620
Oh, you're doing...

5390
03:06:46,620 --> 03:06:47,940
Oh, you just invite me to the party.

5391
03:06:48,080 --> 03:06:48,580
Wait, no.

5392
03:06:48,700 --> 03:06:49,680
Yeah, I'm gonna invite...

5393
03:06:49,680 --> 03:06:50,400
No, I...

5394
03:06:50,400 --> 03:06:51,460
And then you leave.

5395
03:06:51,560 --> 03:06:52,520
Oh, wait, I lost you.

5396
03:06:52,940 --> 03:06:53,260
Okay.

5397
03:06:53,520 --> 03:06:54,380
Wait, oh, wait.

5398
03:06:54,900 --> 03:06:55,780
Blaine, did you...

5399
03:06:55,780 --> 03:06:56,900
Are you in Tokyo server?

5400
03:06:57,380 --> 03:06:58,040
No, no.

5401
03:06:58,180 --> 03:06:59,800
I was gonna send you a friend request.

5402
03:06:59,820 --> 03:07:00,220
Oh, you're gonna send me a...

5403
03:07:00,220 --> 03:07:01,220
Okay, that's smart.

5404
03:07:01,420 --> 03:07:01,520
Okay.

5405
03:07:01,900 --> 03:07:03,140
Yeah, I don't know how to...

5406
03:07:03,140 --> 03:07:03,520
Just...

5407
03:07:03,520 --> 03:07:04,780
Can I send you one?

5408
03:07:05,080 --> 03:07:06,140
No, I'll go to Tokyo.

5409
03:07:06,140 --> 03:07:06,840
Are you on Tokyo?

5410
03:07:07,640 --> 03:07:08,900
Oh, yeah, I'm on Tokyo right now.

5411
03:07:09,680 --> 03:07:10,320
Oh, shit.

5412
03:07:10,360 --> 03:07:12,160
So that's what you're trying to do, Gerard.

5413
03:07:12,380 --> 03:07:12,960
Whoops, sorry.

5414
03:07:13,000 --> 03:07:14,640
Yeah, I was trying to add you and then, uh...

5415
03:07:14,640 --> 03:07:15,580
And then...

5416
03:07:15,580 --> 03:07:16,720
I was like, what are you doing?

5417
03:07:17,660 --> 03:07:18,340
Okay, there we go.

5418
03:07:19,120 --> 03:07:19,700
Sent you.

5419
03:07:20,200 --> 03:07:20,700
Sent you.

5420
03:07:20,800 --> 03:07:22,300
Tokyo, very judgmental.

5421
03:07:22,340 --> 03:07:23,000
There you go.

5422
03:07:23,160 --> 03:07:23,760
There we go, there we go.

5423
03:07:23,800 --> 03:07:24,600
All right, nice.

5424
03:07:24,920 --> 03:07:25,440
We're all in here.

5425
03:07:25,440 --> 03:07:26,440
There we go, there we go.

5426
03:07:26,700 --> 03:07:26,940
Nice.

5427
03:07:27,980 --> 03:07:28,540
All right.

5428
03:07:28,660 --> 03:07:29,460
Oh, and the...

5429
03:07:29,460 --> 03:07:31,240
And pubs in Stormpoint.

5430
03:07:31,460 --> 03:07:32,120
Let's go.

5431
03:07:32,160 --> 03:07:32,600
Let's go.

5432
03:07:33,500 --> 03:07:35,000
Are we gonna get disqualified?

5433
03:07:35,240 --> 03:07:35,760
I swear to God.

5434
03:07:35,900 --> 03:07:36,640
We better not get disqualified.

5435
03:07:37,080 --> 03:07:38,100
We can leave a pub.

5436
03:07:38,220 --> 03:07:38,840
You're fine.

5437
03:07:39,380 --> 03:07:40,260
Okay, okay, okay.

5438
03:07:40,340 --> 03:07:41,200
We can leave a pub.

5439
03:07:41,200 --> 03:07:42,200
I'm afraid we might miss it.

5440
03:07:43,320 --> 03:07:44,500
Okay, great, great, great.

5441
03:07:44,680 --> 03:07:45,320
I'll be fine.

5442
03:07:45,860 --> 03:07:47,220
We can't, we just can't leave a drink.

5443
03:07:47,220 --> 03:07:48,440
Okay, fine, I can breathe here.

5444
03:07:48,780 --> 03:07:49,520
Thank God.

5445
03:07:49,560 --> 03:07:49,860
Yeah.

5446
03:07:50,520 --> 03:07:51,340
I can breathe.

5447
03:07:51,460 --> 03:07:52,260
I can just relax.

5448
03:07:52,340 --> 03:07:52,920
I can do whatever.

5449
03:07:53,080 --> 03:07:54,160
And this is good practice for me.

5450
03:07:54,400 --> 03:07:54,860
Great, great, great.

5451
03:07:54,920 --> 03:07:54,980
Exactly.

5452
03:07:55,340 --> 03:07:56,460
And you can, like, actually...

5453
03:07:57,500 --> 03:08:00,640
Shoot your gun without getting shot at by, like, a Pred player.

5454
03:08:01,460 --> 03:08:01,800
Yeah.

5455
03:08:04,320 --> 03:08:08,600
Like, you can actually shoot your gun and potentially survive.

5456
03:08:09,840 --> 03:08:10,640
Dude, uh...

5457
03:08:10,640 --> 03:08:13,080
One thing I hate about sometimes, like, um...

5458
03:08:13,080 --> 03:08:15,340
Playing Apex is, like, I get shot down immediately.

5459
03:08:15,580 --> 03:08:17,860
That kind of demotivates me, like, um...

5460
03:08:17,860 --> 03:08:22,240
Like, at the beginning, when I was starting out in Apex, like, God damn, these guys are fucking fast!

5461
03:08:22,560 --> 03:08:24,820
Like, they got guns and I'm just, like, dead already.

5462
03:08:25,320 --> 03:08:26,140
Dead on arrival.

5463
03:08:27,780 --> 03:08:28,640
I'm so sorry.

5464
03:08:28,680 --> 03:08:29,880
I'm not like all of you, okay?

5465
03:08:30,240 --> 03:08:30,960
I'm so sorry!

5466
03:08:31,260 --> 03:08:32,380
You can't empathize with me!

5467
03:08:32,580 --> 03:08:34,020
That's why SPMM was invented.

5468
03:08:34,540 --> 03:08:37,260
So now, not everyone else, like, now we suffer.

5469
03:08:37,880 --> 03:08:39,740
People like me, they suffer.

5470
03:08:39,960 --> 03:08:40,720
No, because...

5471
03:08:40,720 --> 03:08:46,020
Because the reason why you got those matches is because SPMM didn't exist.

5472
03:08:46,420 --> 03:08:47,380
So that's, like, stand...

5473
03:08:47,380 --> 03:08:48,180
What was it called?

5474
03:08:49,060 --> 03:08:50,020
What's the...

5475
03:08:50,020 --> 03:08:51,560
What's the definition for SPMM?

5476
03:08:52,100 --> 03:08:53,540
It's something something matchmaking.

5477
03:08:54,740 --> 03:08:55,220
And...

5478
03:08:55,220 --> 03:08:56,140
So, like...

5479
03:08:56,140 --> 03:08:56,980
Skill-based matchmaking.

5480
03:08:57,120 --> 03:08:57,820
Yeah, yeah.

5481
03:08:58,020 --> 03:08:59,580
I forgot the first two words.

5482
03:08:59,900 --> 03:09:03,580
Anyway, so basically, when you first started playing, they didn't have that.

5483
03:09:03,700 --> 03:09:06,100
So you're put in a queue with us.

5484
03:09:06,680 --> 03:09:08,040
Because we wanted to have fun.

5485
03:09:09,620 --> 03:09:13,120
But now, because you guys weren't having fun...

5486
03:09:13,120 --> 03:09:14,540
At least we get to have fun.

5487
03:09:14,540 --> 03:09:16,080
Yeah, at least we get to have fun.

5488
03:09:16,180 --> 03:09:18,560
But now, now we don't get to have fun.

5489
03:09:19,820 --> 03:09:22,320
And you guys get to have fun now.

5490
03:09:24,980 --> 03:09:25,920
Okay, I'm not...

5491
03:09:25,920 --> 03:09:27,540
You choose, you choose.

5492
03:09:27,600 --> 03:09:28,120
I'm not confident.

5493
03:09:28,260 --> 03:09:28,700
We can just...

5494
03:09:29,460 --> 03:09:31,760
Yeah, I think we just land where we're gonna land here.

5495
03:09:31,960 --> 03:09:35,560
Yeah, we're gonna land and then just, you know, practice looting.

5496
03:09:36,520 --> 03:09:37,620
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Gerard.

5497
03:09:38,060 --> 03:09:39,280
Well, what happened to rap part?

5498
03:09:39,800 --> 03:09:40,280
Oh, yeah.

5499
03:09:40,400 --> 03:09:41,040
What happened to rap?

5500
03:09:41,040 --> 03:09:42,760
I'm just trying to aim my shit.

5501
03:09:42,900 --> 03:09:44,920
I'm just trying to aim my shooting.

5502
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:47,540
Whoa, whoa, yeah, but rap part's just great.

5503
03:09:47,740 --> 03:09:48,820
Dude, you're already...

5504
03:09:48,820 --> 03:09:51,120
Dude, dude, I need to practice my aiming.

5505
03:09:51,560 --> 03:09:52,520
Yeah, I think we're gonna have a meeting.

5506
03:09:52,660 --> 03:09:53,380
We might need a...

5507
03:09:53,380 --> 03:09:55,660
Yeah, we might be getting dropped.

5508
03:09:55,880 --> 03:09:56,280
Let's be real.

5509
03:09:58,280 --> 03:09:59,360
Dude, dude.

5510
03:09:59,660 --> 03:10:01,960
You might have to be an LFT soon.

5511
03:10:01,960 --> 03:10:03,720
I guess you're a black guy, where'd this fucker go?

5512
03:10:04,160 --> 03:10:04,980
Wish I ran.

5513
03:10:05,360 --> 03:10:06,580
Fun's not allowed, fun's not allowed.

5514
03:10:06,720 --> 03:10:08,020
We can win now, fun's not allowed.

5515
03:10:08,020 --> 03:10:08,220
Fun's not allowed, this is a fucking...

5516
03:10:08,220 --> 03:10:10,060
This is a practice pun.

5517
03:10:10,060 --> 03:10:12,480
No wonder, no wonder I dropped this game.

5518
03:10:12,520 --> 03:10:14,120
We're scrimming right now.

5519
03:10:14,140 --> 03:10:15,260
Yeah, we're scrimming.

5520
03:10:15,540 --> 03:10:16,280
Lock it in, buddy.

5521
03:10:18,240 --> 03:10:19,500
My god, okay.

5522
03:10:19,820 --> 03:10:21,560
We have like a few minutes anyway.

5523
03:10:21,620 --> 03:10:24,080
This is a problem with scrims these days.

5524
03:10:24,220 --> 03:10:25,740
The quality of scrims are dropping.

5525
03:10:28,680 --> 03:10:30,320
People don't take it seriously.

5526
03:10:30,580 --> 03:10:31,660
These lazy pro players.

5527
03:10:31,680 --> 03:10:35,360
Yeah, these lazy pro players who don't take it seriously.

5528
03:10:36,500 --> 03:10:37,020
Unbelievable.

5529
03:10:37,840 --> 03:10:38,920
They're just in this building.

5530
03:10:39,700 --> 03:10:40,600
Walking out, fun.

5531
03:10:41,160 --> 03:10:42,220
Oh, I'm heading over here.

5532
03:10:42,980 --> 03:10:44,600
I hit the catalyst 100 under me.

5533
03:10:45,120 --> 03:10:46,940
There's a guy under us, I'm gonna drop on him.

5534
03:10:46,940 --> 03:10:47,360
Do it!

5535
03:10:48,400 --> 03:10:49,440
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

5536
03:10:50,640 --> 03:10:51,640
Where is he?

5537
03:10:52,240 --> 03:10:54,940
He's like in the secondary height, I think.

5538
03:10:55,260 --> 03:10:55,500
Okay.

5539
03:10:56,980 --> 03:10:58,300
Gibby almost cracked here in the bub.

5540
03:10:58,980 --> 03:11:00,080
I'm in the secondary height now.

5541
03:11:00,980 --> 03:11:01,600
I don't see him.

5542
03:11:02,960 --> 03:11:03,860
Gerard is pushing.

5543
03:11:04,080 --> 03:11:04,560
I'm with you, Gerard.

5544
03:11:04,560 --> 03:11:05,560
Oh, wait, wait!

5545
03:11:05,580 --> 03:11:07,200
Wow, look at him go!

5546
03:11:07,940 --> 03:11:08,160
What?

5547
03:11:08,920 --> 03:11:10,480
Oh, Gerard, you're cold!

5548
03:11:11,220 --> 03:11:12,460
Told you, told you.

5549
03:11:12,900 --> 03:11:14,200
He's in the crack!

5550
03:11:15,020 --> 03:11:16,420
He's here, we're all here to have fun!

5551
03:11:16,520 --> 03:11:17,260
Chill time, chill time.

5552
03:11:17,280 --> 03:11:18,120
He's him!

5553
03:11:18,740 --> 03:11:19,820
See, I am him!

5554
03:11:19,920 --> 03:11:20,240
I'm him!

5555
03:11:20,240 --> 03:11:20,940
Oh my god!

5556
03:11:21,300 --> 03:11:22,280
What the fuck?

5557
03:11:22,720 --> 03:11:24,140
Oh my god, I'm not him.

5558
03:11:24,360 --> 03:11:24,500
Oh, oh wow.

5559
03:11:24,780 --> 03:11:25,180
Whoa!

5560
03:11:26,340 --> 03:11:27,540
Time to save it, Doki.

5561
03:11:27,640 --> 03:11:28,180
What happened?

5562
03:11:28,280 --> 03:11:28,700
What happened?

5563
03:11:28,940 --> 03:11:30,500
I'm just not him!

5564
03:11:30,860 --> 03:11:31,300
I'm not!

5565
03:11:31,480 --> 03:11:32,280
That's a full team.

5566
03:11:32,480 --> 03:11:33,000
That's a full team.

5567
03:11:33,360 --> 03:11:34,920
Back up the Doki, back up the Doki.

5568
03:11:35,400 --> 03:11:35,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5569
03:11:35,980 --> 03:11:38,640
That guy literally, like, fucking gunned me down.

5570
03:11:38,640 --> 03:11:40,200
I was confused.

5571
03:11:41,360 --> 03:11:42,140
Yeah, he's fine.

5572
03:11:44,580 --> 03:11:45,540
No way!

5573
03:11:46,580 --> 03:11:47,060
Nice.

5574
03:11:47,400 --> 03:11:48,200
Hey, I'm back.

5575
03:11:52,120 --> 03:11:53,240
What the fuck?

5576
03:11:53,260 --> 03:11:55,680
Am I just used as- Oh, oh!

5577
03:11:56,440 --> 03:11:56,920
Oh!

5578
03:11:58,560 --> 03:11:59,360
He's him!

5579
03:12:00,160 --> 03:12:00,840
I am him!

5580
03:12:00,980 --> 03:12:01,380
Told you!

5581
03:12:01,380 --> 03:12:02,020
Look at me!

5582
03:12:02,180 --> 03:12:02,900
Look at me!

5583
03:12:03,020 --> 03:12:03,800
Look at you!

5584
03:12:03,940 --> 03:12:04,580
Look at me!

5585
03:12:04,660 --> 03:12:05,280
Look at you!

5586
03:12:05,640 --> 03:12:06,160
Look at me!

5587
03:12:06,240 --> 03:12:07,060
Look at you!

5588
03:12:07,400 --> 03:12:08,980
We're gonna die if you do that.

5589
03:12:08,980 --> 03:12:10,560
Stop holding me down!

5590
03:12:12,540 --> 03:12:16,060
I was waiting for somebody to shoot us, not gonna lie.

5591
03:12:20,140 --> 03:12:21,440
Oh my god.

5592
03:12:21,740 --> 03:12:23,420
I completely forgot we were still in draft.

5593
03:12:24,300 --> 03:12:26,500
Oh, they just dragged me over to the draft.

5594
03:12:27,140 --> 03:12:28,700
I was- I was not ready.

5595
03:12:29,060 --> 03:12:30,660
I was not ready.

5596
03:12:30,740 --> 03:12:32,260
Did you grab us a spot?

5597
03:12:32,860 --> 03:12:35,420
Yeah, yeah, it was okay, it was okay.

5598
03:12:35,440 --> 03:12:36,980
You were just like- It was okay, I'm alright, I'm alright.

5599
03:12:36,980 --> 03:12:42,180
You were watching Jirard pop the fuck off and you were like, Whoa, whoa!

5600
03:12:43,600 --> 03:12:46,260
I was gonna say- Again, subversion of expectation.

5601
03:12:46,420 --> 03:12:51,220
Yeah, I was gonna say, why do you have zero reaction to Jirard popping the fuck off?

5602
03:12:52,400 --> 03:12:55,720
I was like, damn, tough love right there.

5603
03:12:56,000 --> 03:12:57,320
He was not impressed.

5604
03:12:58,460 --> 03:13:00,520
I gotta- I gotta say though, that actually helps.

5605
03:13:00,680 --> 03:13:03,300
Tough love gives me the reality check that I need.

5606
03:13:03,660 --> 03:13:04,760
I gotta improve even harder.

5607
03:13:05,320 --> 03:13:09,100
It's just like, for Flame, he's like, you should do better.

5608
03:13:10,140 --> 03:13:11,840
I'm the unimpressed tiger parent.

5609
03:13:11,880 --> 03:13:14,440
Yeah, yeah, you're just like, no response.

5610
03:13:14,860 --> 03:13:15,620
It's just not enough.

5611
03:13:16,300 --> 03:13:18,020
Not enough to do better.

5612
03:13:18,640 --> 03:13:19,760
But thank you though, thank you.

5613
03:13:20,160 --> 03:13:21,340
Feels bad, man.

5614
03:13:22,780 --> 03:13:25,320
What did you get us for the second?

5615
03:13:25,880 --> 03:13:27,980
I got Epicenter, Voltage.

5616
03:13:28,800 --> 03:13:29,380
That's nice.

5617
03:13:29,680 --> 03:13:32,960
All the- all the POIs on Voltage were like, kind of digging.

5618
03:13:33,320 --> 03:13:34,460
It was all like- Oh yeah, all the good ones.

5619
03:13:35,480 --> 03:13:36,200
Yeah, yeah.

5620
03:13:36,200 --> 03:13:39,040
Hey, at least it's not- it's not Ragnarik.

5621
03:13:39,700 --> 03:13:44,900
Yeah, I mean, it's- it's between- it's between uh, like, Geyser or Epicenter.

5622
03:13:45,240 --> 03:13:47,940
But I think Epicenter is better because we want to like, rotate.

5623
03:13:48,260 --> 03:13:50,400
Yeah, and they're like- Where are they fighting?

5624
03:13:50,560 --> 03:13:51,300
Oh, they're fighting over there.

5625
03:13:51,340 --> 03:13:51,900
Oh, I see it.

5626
03:13:54,380 --> 03:13:55,120
Oh my god.

5627
03:13:55,240 --> 03:13:58,060
What if we oop this team on the right and then just kill them?

5628
03:13:58,100 --> 03:13:58,360
Do it.

5629
03:13:58,800 --> 03:13:59,240
Do it.

5630
03:13:59,460 --> 03:13:59,860
No balls.

5631
03:14:00,600 --> 03:14:01,760
Yeah, I'm right behind you.

5632
03:14:01,840 --> 03:14:06,020
Okay, we don't- I don't think we- no, we do- Yeah, I'm doing it.

5633
03:14:06,020 --> 03:14:06,600
You totally make it.

5634
03:14:06,780 --> 03:14:07,320
I'm doing it.

5635
03:14:07,540 --> 03:14:08,800
I don't think I can make it.

5636
03:14:08,940 --> 03:14:10,220
You're- you're a prof- oh, I make it.

5637
03:14:11,080 --> 03:14:11,800
I killed one.

5638
03:14:12,320 --> 03:14:13,080
I'm gonna die.

5639
03:14:13,500 --> 03:14:13,900
Nope.

5640
03:14:14,140 --> 03:14:14,420
Uh oh.

5641
03:14:15,080 --> 03:14:16,000
Oh, he's on the left.

5642
03:14:16,440 --> 03:14:16,980
It's all you.

5643
03:14:17,740 --> 03:14:17,980
It's fine.

5644
03:14:18,240 --> 03:14:18,920
Pushing on the right.

5645
03:14:19,300 --> 03:14:19,900
Horizon on you.

5646
03:14:21,040 --> 03:14:21,920
Oh, you win this.

5647
03:14:22,740 --> 03:14:24,420
I don't- Okay, Dorade, you have to run away, Dorade.

5648
03:14:24,860 --> 03:14:25,760
Run away, Dorade.

5649
03:14:26,460 --> 03:14:26,680
Wait.

5650
03:14:26,880 --> 03:14:27,540
Oh, wait.

5651
03:14:28,320 --> 03:14:29,360
Wait, come- come up, Dorade.

5652
03:14:29,660 --> 03:14:30,660
No, no!

5653
03:14:31,060 --> 03:14:31,660
No, there's 19!

5654
03:14:31,780 --> 03:14:32,300
There's 19!

5655
03:14:32,500 --> 03:14:33,280
There's 19!

5656
03:14:34,920 --> 03:14:36,220
The other team!

5657
03:14:36,580 --> 03:14:36,660
No!

5658
03:14:37,020 --> 03:14:38,940
We got - we got thirded!

5659
03:14:39,500 --> 03:14:39,940
No!

5660
03:14:40,160 --> 03:14:43,240
Yeah, that's- you see, we're practicing now to not get thirded.

5661
03:14:43,540 --> 03:14:43,900
Yeah, yeah.

5662
03:14:44,100 --> 03:14:48,900
Now, we won't get thirded now because we know- we- we know.

5663
03:14:49,960 --> 03:14:51,040
It's fine.

5664
03:14:51,360 --> 03:14:52,680
I'll be okay.

5665
03:14:52,840 --> 03:14:57,140
I like- oh, did they like- they automatically dragged you because you didn't show up!

5666
03:14:57,780 --> 03:14:58,900
Yes, I did.

5667
03:15:00,600 --> 03:15:02,980
They're just like this- this EN team.

5668
03:15:03,280 --> 03:15:03,420
They're just -

5669
03:15:07,500 --> 03:15:10,000
Okay, did you guys go back to the lobby?

5670
03:15:10,020 --> 03:15:10,740
I'm sorry, Dokkaebi.

5671
03:15:10,740 --> 03:15:12,740
We might be getting blacklisted from future performance.

5672
03:15:13,940 --> 03:15:14,300
What?

5673
03:15:14,620 --> 03:15:15,320
What happened?

5674
03:15:16,560 --> 03:15:19,360
And I'm dragging you all down with me.

5675
03:15:22,180 --> 03:15:23,180
Wait, where are you guys?

5676
03:15:23,240 --> 03:15:24,620
Did you guys like, uh- No, we're cute.

5677
03:15:24,660 --> 03:15:25,020
We're cute.

5678
03:15:25,200 --> 03:15:27,140
No, no, we- We're cute.

5679
03:15:27,280 --> 03:15:28,040
We're- we're all cute.

5680
03:15:28,140 --> 03:15:30,360
Oh my god, Dorade, get off that mistoki!

5681
03:15:30,880 --> 03:15:31,800
Oh my god!

5682
03:15:32,020 --> 03:15:33,080
Oh my god!

5683
03:15:33,080 --> 03:15:36,300
Wait, what'd I say, what'd I say?

5684
03:15:36,540 --> 03:15:37,460
Oh my god!

5685
03:15:38,280 --> 03:15:39,500
I got two kills, too!

5686
03:15:39,520 --> 03:15:39,860
Oh my god!

5687
03:15:40,180 --> 03:15:40,280
Oh yeah!

5688
03:15:40,760 --> 03:15:42,420
All right, all right.

5689
03:15:42,600 --> 03:15:44,280
But, Dorade, now do that on Rampart.

5690
03:15:47,140 --> 03:15:48,720
Okay, fine, fine.

5691
03:15:48,820 --> 03:15:51,920
I'm gonna- Now do that on Rampart, Dorade.

5692
03:15:51,980 --> 03:15:53,320
I have a fucking big-ass hitbox.

5693
03:15:53,320 --> 03:15:53,340
Okay, fine, okay.

5694
03:15:53,340 --> 03:15:54,900
I'm gonna queue this time for Rampart.

5695
03:15:55,460 --> 03:15:59,260
Okay, fine, fine, fine.

5696
03:15:59,640 --> 03:16:01,300
Have you guys watched season two of Arcane?

5697
03:16:01,820 --> 03:16:02,220
No.

5698
03:16:02,340 --> 03:16:03,100
Oh shit, yeah!

5699
03:16:03,620 --> 03:16:04,020
Dude!

5700
03:16:04,480 --> 03:16:05,620
Did you finish it?

5701
03:16:05,900 --> 03:16:06,240
Yeah.

5702
03:16:07,060 --> 03:16:07,860
Oh god.

5703
03:16:08,180 --> 03:16:10,280
Ah, dude, Toki hasn't watched it.

5704
03:16:10,360 --> 03:16:11,000
I don't want to spoil it.

5705
03:16:11,260 --> 03:16:12,180
No, you can spoil it.

5706
03:16:12,280 --> 03:16:15,980
No, no, no, no, spoil it because I might not- I might not watch Arcane.

5707
03:16:16,140 --> 03:16:17,380
I never even watched season one.

5708
03:16:17,560 --> 03:16:17,920
Really?

5709
03:16:18,000 --> 03:16:19,240
I don't- Dude, it's great!

5710
03:16:19,240 --> 03:16:21,160
No, because I don't want to play League.

5711
03:16:21,380 --> 03:16:23,940
I don't want to- No, you don't have to play League.

5712
03:16:24,600 --> 03:16:25,060
I don't want to play League.

5713
03:16:25,060 --> 03:16:26,160
Dude, there is no relation.

5714
03:16:26,480 --> 03:16:28,540
You don't get to learn about- No, I'm too scared.

5715
03:16:28,540 --> 03:16:29,340
Dude, I never play League.

5716
03:16:29,340 --> 03:16:30,240
I did play League.

5717
03:16:30,300 --> 03:16:30,940
I only played once.

5718
03:16:30,940 --> 03:16:34,460
That's what they all say for shows adapted from video games.

5719
03:16:34,960 --> 03:16:42,260
Because people are like, people started playing League because of Arcane, and I'm scared that's going to happen to me, and I don't want to play League.

5720
03:16:42,820 --> 03:16:46,020
I don't want to- You're afraid of what Marvel did to you?

5721
03:16:46,400 --> 03:16:47,540
Dude, it's okay.

5722
03:16:48,440 --> 03:16:49,080
I'm scared.

5723
03:16:49,260 --> 03:16:50,760
No, because it always happens.

5724
03:16:51,240 --> 03:16:52,620
The Fallout show came out.

5725
03:16:52,700 --> 03:16:53,560
I played Fallout.

5726
03:16:55,760 --> 03:16:57,160
Well, isn't that great?

5727
03:16:57,480 --> 03:16:58,280
No, it's not.

5728
03:16:58,500 --> 03:16:59,300
It's League.

5729
03:16:59,300 --> 03:17:02,880
Oh yeah, you're right, you're right, you're right.

5730
03:17:02,880 --> 03:17:04,680
You do lose a piece of yourself forever.

5731
03:17:05,020 --> 03:17:05,980
Oh shit, I forgot.

5732
03:17:06,160 --> 03:17:06,980
Oh god, Rampart.

5733
03:17:07,120 --> 03:17:07,520
Oh fuck.

5734
03:17:07,880 --> 03:17:08,000
All right.

5735
03:17:08,440 --> 03:17:08,580
Wow.

5736
03:17:09,120 --> 03:17:11,820
This kind of behavior will not be tolerated further.

5737
03:17:12,240 --> 03:17:13,540
Wait, can we- We can quit, right?

5738
03:17:13,540 --> 03:17:15,720
You have- No, no, I'm not quitting.

5739
03:17:15,840 --> 03:17:16,280
It's okay.

5740
03:17:16,300 --> 03:17:17,240
No, it's a fucking pub.

5741
03:17:17,380 --> 03:17:19,140
We're not quitting a pub.

5742
03:17:20,980 --> 03:17:22,640
So I can go with Rampart.

5743
03:17:22,920 --> 03:17:25,740
I forgot we were talking about goddamn Arcane.

5744
03:17:25,880 --> 03:17:26,820
I was like so out of it.

5745
03:17:26,820 --> 03:17:27,600
All right, spoil me about Arcane.

5746
03:17:27,680 --> 03:17:28,760
What do you want to say about Arcane?

5747
03:17:30,100 --> 03:17:35,720
The echo, like having to go back from the alternate reality, that breaks my heart, man.

5748
03:17:36,160 --> 03:17:36,440
Yeah.

5749
03:17:36,780 --> 03:17:40,500
Oh, that's probably the single worst moment in Arcane for me.

5750
03:17:40,980 --> 03:17:43,920
Dude, I've been seeing, like, theorizing- What, what?

5751
03:17:44,180 --> 03:17:56,540
When they cut to the scene where he, like, lights out the paper in the same spot where, like, Kim and Powderkiss and the other, like, alternate reality, that hit, bro.

5752
03:17:56,680 --> 03:17:57,160
Dude!

5753
03:17:57,220 --> 03:17:58,720
That hit hard, man.

5754
03:17:58,720 --> 03:17:59,980
Yeah, what could have been?

5755
03:18:00,320 --> 03:18:01,660
It's like an- Oh, no.

5756
03:18:02,800 --> 03:18:05,180
Dude, he had a crush on her this entire time.

5757
03:18:05,440 --> 03:18:07,080
Oh, it's so sad, man.

5758
03:18:07,460 --> 03:18:14,980
Yeah, now it kind of made me look back to, like, the first season while, um, while Echo was, like, choking out, like, Powder because, like, you know, they were fighting.

5759
03:18:15,340 --> 03:18:23,380
Like, dude, that must have been so painful just to see your crush, like, just, like, uh, get so demented and crazy, bro.

5760
03:18:23,460 --> 03:18:27,880
When he goes back, he has to literally stop her from offing herself, like, 15 times.

5761
03:18:27,880 --> 03:18:28,940
That's, like, insane.

5762
03:18:29,280 --> 03:18:29,760
What?!

5763
03:18:30,440 --> 03:18:35,680
Oh my- see, this is why- Yeah, because every opportunity that he gets to talk is just like, she pulls the fucking punch.

5764
03:18:35,700 --> 03:18:37,540
Yeah, it's just- Yeah, oh, okay.

5765
03:18:37,580 --> 03:18:39,380
Oh my god, that sounds crazy.

5766
03:18:40,100 --> 03:18:41,460
Yeah, god.

5767
03:18:42,160 --> 03:18:43,840
That sounds fucking crazy.

5768
03:18:44,300 --> 03:18:45,640
Anyway, are you two League players?

5769
03:18:45,780 --> 03:18:46,540
Do you guys play League?

5770
03:18:46,800 --> 03:18:48,600
Anyway, no, no.

5771
03:18:49,720 --> 03:18:50,580
Crazy, denied.

5772
03:18:50,860 --> 03:18:52,300
Are you a League player, Gerard?

5773
03:18:53,200 --> 03:18:54,100
No, no.

5774
03:18:54,320 --> 03:18:55,500
Okay, so they didn't get you.

5775
03:18:55,580 --> 03:18:57,720
I have been tempted to play League because of that.

5776
03:18:57,720 --> 03:18:59,500
See, you've been tempted.

5777
03:19:00,140 --> 03:19:02,880
Yeah, tempted, but I never gave in to my urges.

5778
03:19:03,040 --> 03:19:04,700
For now, for now.

5779
03:19:04,920 --> 03:19:05,440
Oh, for now.

5780
03:19:05,680 --> 03:19:09,660
You've never- I mean, if I had friends to play it, then yes, I would definitely.

5781
03:19:09,980 --> 03:19:13,080
Wait, does Armin stop- I played it once, just, like, the training, but that's it.

5782
03:19:13,280 --> 03:19:16,040
Does no one in Holostars EN play League?

5783
03:19:16,780 --> 03:19:20,020
I mean, they do, of course, it's just like- But they don't invite you?

5784
03:19:20,780 --> 03:19:23,560
I mean, they do, but I just didn't have the time for it.

5785
03:19:24,660 --> 03:19:26,140
Yeah, I don't know about time.

5786
03:19:26,140 --> 03:19:28,220
You just have the self-respect, you know?

5787
03:19:28,980 --> 03:19:34,320
Yeah, I think, I mean, I streamed it, and I invited some of them, and then, oh, shit, I don't want to play this thing anymore.

5788
03:19:36,520 --> 03:19:41,720
Like, it's only during, like, moments where, like, I don't want to feel like playing League today or something.

5789
03:19:43,160 --> 03:19:43,560
Stuff like that.

5790
03:19:43,560 --> 03:19:45,040
See, I'm scared of it hooking me.

5791
03:19:45,040 --> 03:19:45,520
But I am interested.

5792
03:19:46,160 --> 03:19:46,740
It's like- What?

5793
03:19:46,920 --> 03:19:51,240
I'm scared of League, like, unlocking something inside me.

5794
03:19:51,240 --> 03:19:51,780
I'm scared.

5795
03:19:52,080 --> 03:19:57,020
I have- I'm, like, very easily, like, influenced.

5796
03:19:57,680 --> 03:19:59,880
So, I'm worried.

5797
03:20:00,200 --> 03:20:01,200
You're a victim to capitalism.

5798
03:20:01,400 --> 03:20:07,020
Yeah, I'm a- No, it's like, the thing is, when I get addicted to something, it's really bad.

5799
03:20:08,520 --> 03:20:10,480
Like, when I got addicted to Marvel, right?

5800
03:20:10,540 --> 03:20:11,580
Okay, I still am.

5801
03:20:12,120 --> 03:20:13,740
I literally did nothing.

5802
03:20:14,520 --> 03:20:19,000
I got yelled at by my manager, because I- Who I paid for, by the way.

5803
03:20:19,060 --> 03:20:20,160
I paid this manager.

5804
03:20:20,160 --> 03:20:25,320
Because I literally did zero work for three days straight.

5805
03:20:25,460 --> 03:20:29,080
Because all I did was just play Marvel Rivals.

5806
03:20:29,640 --> 03:20:31,740
And then they're like, you need to do this.

5807
03:20:31,900 --> 03:20:33,100
And I'm like, okay.

5808
03:20:33,440 --> 03:20:35,800
And then I just put up Marvel Rivals.

5809
03:20:36,400 --> 03:20:37,600
Oh my god, gamers.

5810
03:20:37,720 --> 03:20:38,920
Yeah, like, I feel that.

5811
03:20:41,500 --> 03:20:44,200
I had a deadlock addiction for a little bit.

5812
03:20:46,440 --> 03:20:47,320
Deadlock, yo.

5813
03:20:47,460 --> 03:20:48,060
Deadlock's pretty fun.

5814
03:20:48,060 --> 03:20:48,460
You guys play Deadlock?

5815
03:20:48,720 --> 03:20:49,840
I play Deadlock, yeah, yeah.

5816
03:20:49,840 --> 03:20:52,040
But then Marvel Rivals came out, and then I stopped playing.

5817
03:20:52,980 --> 03:20:53,420
Same!

5818
03:20:54,120 --> 03:20:55,140
Honestly, same!

5819
03:20:55,780 --> 03:20:59,480
I stopped as soon as something funner, like, came out.

5820
03:20:59,860 --> 03:21:00,780
Whoa, fun?

5821
03:21:00,880 --> 03:21:01,500
More fun?

5822
03:21:01,960 --> 03:21:05,100
Whoa, to be fair, true, because Deadlock's a MOBA.

5823
03:21:05,480 --> 03:21:11,340
I just hate- I hate the MOBA part of the- Wait, who shot you?

5824
03:21:13,200 --> 03:21:15,600
Uh, in front of me, on the rock.

5825
03:21:15,920 --> 03:21:16,900
It's a full team.

5826
03:21:17,020 --> 03:21:18,000
What the fuck?

5827
03:21:18,040 --> 03:21:18,660
He sees me.

5828
03:21:18,720 --> 03:21:19,740
Holy shit.

5829
03:21:19,740 --> 03:21:20,960
We could teleport behind him.

5830
03:21:20,960 --> 03:21:21,600
He gets this peek?

5831
03:21:21,880 --> 03:21:23,000
I'm ulting Roran here.

5832
03:21:23,140 --> 03:21:24,760
Oh, I don't know about the peepee!

5833
03:21:24,980 --> 03:21:25,160
Oh my god, Jarod!

5834
03:21:27,040 --> 03:21:27,440
Jarod, what the fuck?

5835
03:21:27,440 --> 03:21:28,940
Octane's one, Octane's one on the rock.

5836
03:21:28,960 --> 03:21:30,440
I know, I know, I know.

5837
03:21:30,620 --> 03:21:32,680
Jarod, that was a crazy- I netted him Luckman.

5838
03:21:33,400 --> 03:21:35,040
I have to use my bubble.

5839
03:21:35,980 --> 03:21:39,300
That's a crazy thing you just did in front of me.

5840
03:21:40,820 --> 03:21:42,280
Oh, I might be getting pushed.

5841
03:21:42,980 --> 03:21:44,380
I can- I can walk back, I'll be fine.

5842
03:21:45,180 --> 03:21:46,160
I'm looking for you, I'm looking for you.

5843
03:21:46,860 --> 03:21:47,660
They're not pushing it?

5844
03:21:47,920 --> 03:21:48,540
Oh, shit.

5845
03:21:49,080 --> 03:21:50,520
I have to back out, I have to back out.

5846
03:21:50,520 --> 03:21:51,040
Oh, I killed him!

5847
03:21:51,320 --> 03:21:51,660
Oh, yo!

5848
03:21:51,940 --> 03:21:52,340
Nice headshot!

5849
03:21:52,400 --> 03:21:54,000
Holy fuck, that's insane.

5850
03:21:54,900 --> 03:21:55,400
I'm looking.

5851
03:21:55,540 --> 03:21:57,440
Bruh, bruh, bruh, bruh, bruh, bruh, bruh, bruh.

5852
03:21:57,460 --> 03:21:58,040
I have 56.

5853
03:21:58,340 --> 03:22:00,130
I don't have a scope for this triple take, so...

5854
03:22:00,900 --> 03:22:01,200
What?

5855
03:22:01,280 --> 03:22:02,200
There's a team right behind- Oh!

5856
03:22:03,060 --> 03:22:04,160
Is that- is that their third?

5857
03:22:04,220 --> 03:22:06,060
It's a different team, it's a different team, it's a different team, it's a different team, it's a different team.

5858
03:22:06,080 --> 03:22:06,860
Nice, nice, nice!

5859
03:22:07,060 --> 03:22:07,860
Oh, no, please die.

5860
03:22:07,860 --> 03:22:09,920
I usually remember when the wingman was so fucking OP.

5861
03:22:10,220 --> 03:22:10,880
Please one, no.

5862
03:22:11,360 --> 03:22:12,020
Oh, goodbye.

5863
03:22:13,360 --> 03:22:14,540
You're so fucking dead.

5864
03:22:14,580 --> 03:22:15,960
Yo, yo, yo- Oh, I have the last!

5865
03:22:18,540 --> 03:22:19,180
It's a team!

5866
03:22:20,320 --> 03:22:21,460
Oh my god, he's doing it again!

5867
03:22:21,600 --> 03:22:21,860
No!

5868
03:22:23,780 --> 03:22:24,020
No!

5869
03:22:25,140 --> 03:22:28,460
My Nessie shot him for 24 damage, though, and did his job.

5870
03:22:30,900 --> 03:22:32,620
He did his job.

5871
03:22:33,160 --> 03:22:33,840
That's all that matters.

5872
03:22:33,860 --> 03:22:35,960
Oh, that rampart is crazy, man.

5873
03:22:36,320 --> 03:22:38,680
I didn't hear the footsteps, he just showed up.

5874
03:22:39,400 --> 03:22:39,820
Oh, man.

5875
03:22:40,000 --> 03:22:41,840
Oh, this is Care Pack L-Star, yeah.

5876
03:22:42,260 --> 03:22:44,800
Oh, yeah, yeah, they have the special thing.

5877
03:22:45,180 --> 03:22:46,660
All right, we get to have one more- I died so quickly.

5878
03:22:46,660 --> 03:22:49,420
Uh, we should move to the winner's bracket.

5879
03:22:49,500 --> 03:22:50,200
Oh, yeah, that's true.

5880
03:22:50,320 --> 03:22:52,440
Yeah, but no one else is there.

5881
03:22:53,180 --> 03:22:55,380
Wait, there's like 10 teams in there.

5882
03:22:55,780 --> 03:22:56,900
I think- oh, is there?

5883
03:22:57,120 --> 03:22:58,100
Oh, okay.

5884
03:22:58,480 --> 03:22:59,560
Are we with five, right?

5885
03:22:59,880 --> 03:23:00,820
We're team five, yeah.

5886
03:23:01,220 --> 03:23:01,660
All right.

5887
03:23:03,280 --> 03:23:05,260
Hello, I'm back.

5888
03:23:05,700 --> 03:23:08,860
I need to fix my wingman if we're team five.

5889
03:23:09,260 --> 03:23:09,620
Hello, hello.

5890
03:23:10,340 --> 03:23:12,380
I gotta- oh, I don't think he knows where it is.

5891
03:23:12,440 --> 03:23:15,080
I don't think- I'm sure I was trying to figure out where the fuck it is.

5892
03:23:15,080 --> 03:23:17,520
Oh, no, this is not a good sign.

5893
03:23:18,380 --> 03:23:20,180
We've been through this before.

5894
03:23:20,740 --> 03:23:23,680
He doesn't know where team five is.

5895
03:23:24,060 --> 03:23:25,100
Oh, no.

5896
03:23:26,320 --> 03:23:26,520
Jirai.

5897
03:23:27,600 --> 03:23:29,820
Jirai, just scroll down, Jirai.

5898
03:23:31,940 --> 03:23:34,560
You know what kicked me off my deadlock addiction?

5899
03:23:34,860 --> 03:23:35,160
What?

5900
03:23:35,820 --> 03:23:38,920
I was playing in a- an Aeternus ranked lobby.

5901
03:23:39,320 --> 03:23:42,160
And there's this, like, guy that I was queuing with.

5902
03:23:42,520 --> 03:23:43,500
A friend of a friend.

5903
03:23:44,240 --> 03:23:45,740
And I was playing so bad.

5904
03:23:45,800 --> 03:23:48,300
I think I went, like, zero on six, two games in a row.

5905
03:23:48,320 --> 03:23:49,240
And then it was over.

5906
03:23:49,560 --> 03:23:53,960
And then in the second game, he told me, like, he told me- This is- this guy's Chinese.

5907
03:23:55,100 --> 03:23:56,580
Please stop queue.

5908
03:23:57,820 --> 03:24:00,120
Like, like, please stop queue.

5909
03:24:00,800 --> 03:24:01,240
Bro.

5910
03:24:01,900 --> 03:24:02,860
Oh my god.

5911
03:24:02,900 --> 03:24:04,200
That just hurt you?

5912
03:24:04,920 --> 03:24:07,100
That hurt me in my soul.

5913
03:24:07,240 --> 03:24:11,060
If he told me to uninstall the game, I would have- I would have just laughed it off.

5914
03:24:11,340 --> 03:24:13,340
But he just told me, please stop queue.

5915
03:24:14,260 --> 03:24:17,480
I've never been insulted like that in my whole life before, man.

5916
03:24:17,480 --> 03:24:17,940
What happened?

5917
03:24:18,180 --> 03:24:18,460
What happened?

5918
03:24:18,460 --> 03:24:20,740
I actually- I stopped playing the game after that.

5919
03:24:20,960 --> 03:24:21,860
Like, I straight up stopped.

5920
03:24:22,400 --> 03:24:24,040
I didn't come back from that.

5921
03:24:24,600 --> 03:24:25,160
Tea happened?

5922
03:24:25,280 --> 03:24:26,040
What the fuck happened?

5923
03:24:26,200 --> 03:24:26,460
What?

5924
03:24:27,080 --> 03:24:28,120
You'll never know, Jaron.

5925
03:24:28,220 --> 03:24:31,140
You gotta wait until the stream- You gotta wait until the stream's over.

5926
03:24:31,380 --> 03:24:31,580
I'm sorry, Jaron.

5927
03:24:31,600 --> 03:24:32,820
I'm not gonna repeat it.

5928
03:24:32,820 --> 03:24:34,200
We're right- we're here right now!

5929
03:24:34,320 --> 03:24:35,000
Say it to me!

5930
03:24:35,160 --> 03:24:35,500
I'm sorry, Jaron.

5931
03:24:35,780 --> 03:24:37,640
No, that's not- that's a story you can't repeat.

5932
03:24:38,120 --> 03:24:43,440
He was sharing his, like- He was sharing his deepest, darkest regret to me.

5933
03:24:43,440 --> 03:24:48,200
It just brings out too much painful memories to say it again, Jaron.

5934
03:24:48,660 --> 03:24:50,200
Yeah, wait until the stream's over.

5935
03:24:50,340 --> 03:24:52,860
As soon as I got here, like, I will never play Apex again.

5936
03:24:55,880 --> 03:24:56,900
Crazy to hear!

5937
03:24:57,220 --> 03:24:59,000
After we're inside the tournament, like, huh?

5938
03:24:59,240 --> 03:25:00,520
Did somebody fight in here?

5939
03:25:00,580 --> 03:25:01,220
Jaron, Jaron!

5940
03:25:01,440 --> 03:25:02,260
Pick, pick, pick!

5941
03:25:02,540 --> 03:25:03,020
Oh, yeah, yeah.

5942
03:25:03,220 --> 03:25:04,020
You're right, okay, there we go.

5943
03:25:04,160 --> 03:25:05,980
It wasn't Apex, it was Deadlock.

5944
03:25:06,480 --> 03:25:07,500
It was Deadlock.

5945
03:25:08,260 --> 03:25:11,320
Stop talking about fucking tea while I'm picking characters.

5946
03:25:11,600 --> 03:25:12,380
I can't focus.

5947
03:25:13,760 --> 03:25:15,780
I don't know if we can play this game.

5948
03:25:16,660 --> 03:25:17,060
Code is out.

5949
03:25:17,060 --> 03:25:18,160
I don't know, I wasn't listening.

5950
03:25:19,080 --> 03:25:20,460
Okay, where's the code?

5951
03:25:20,900 --> 03:25:21,880
It starts in five minutes.

5952
03:25:22,260 --> 03:25:22,960
Oh, it starts in five minutes?

5953
03:25:22,980 --> 03:25:23,580
Okay, five minutes?

5954
03:25:23,800 --> 03:25:24,580
Okay, we can leave then.

5955
03:25:24,640 --> 03:25:27,340
We kind of have to hot drop and then just- Yeah, we can just hot drop.

5956
03:25:27,560 --> 03:25:28,880
Hot drop and then die.

5957
03:25:29,760 --> 03:25:29,980
Yeah.

5958
03:25:30,200 --> 03:25:30,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5959
03:25:33,140 --> 03:25:35,460
If we're late again, they might actually blacklist us.

5960
03:25:35,600 --> 03:25:36,940
Okay, so I'm dropping down, dropping down.

5961
03:25:37,080 --> 03:25:37,980
Drop down now.

5962
03:25:38,920 --> 03:25:39,520
That's right.

5963
03:25:39,660 --> 03:25:40,840
Oh, there's a lot of teams here.

5964
03:25:40,900 --> 03:25:41,340
Let's go.

5965
03:25:41,540 --> 03:25:42,620
I'm going bottom floor.

5966
03:25:44,440 --> 03:25:47,200
I'm going- Hey, there's another person with a Pred trail too.

5967
03:25:47,420 --> 03:25:48,180
Let's go.

5968
03:25:49,000 --> 03:25:50,200
Jarrad, you fight that guy.

5969
03:25:50,360 --> 03:25:50,460
I believe in you.

5970
03:25:50,460 --> 03:25:51,580
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, okay.

5971
03:25:57,390 --> 03:25:58,930
Whoa, look at him go.

5972
03:26:01,070 --> 03:26:01,770
Okay, down.

5973
03:26:03,310 --> 03:26:05,070
Whoa, you meleeed somebody.

5974
03:26:06,110 --> 03:26:06,650
Oh my god.

5975
03:26:07,170 --> 03:26:10,470
I was doing a finisher!

5976
03:26:11,190 --> 03:26:12,570
Okay, that makes more sense.

5977
03:26:12,790 --> 03:26:13,750
Ow, ow, ow, they're shooting at me!

5978
03:26:13,770 --> 03:26:14,810
Oh, he's one, he's one, he's one.

5979
03:26:15,170 --> 03:26:15,710
Got you.

5980
03:26:16,630 --> 03:26:18,310
Okay, he was not one.

5981
03:26:18,490 --> 03:26:21,550
That was- No, okay, now the lifeline, the lifeline.

5982
03:26:21,590 --> 03:26:23,410
Oh, your lifeline, okay, I was gonna say.

5983
03:26:23,410 --> 03:26:24,170
The lifeline was not one.

5984
03:26:25,190 --> 03:26:26,610
Literally, you were like, he's one.

5985
03:26:26,690 --> 03:26:28,830
And I shot like a full HP guy.

5986
03:26:30,910 --> 03:26:31,650
I was like, okay.

5987
03:26:31,650 --> 03:26:32,790
No, just straight gaslighting.

5988
03:26:32,910 --> 03:26:33,250
Yeah.

5989
03:26:33,550 --> 03:26:34,270
Straight gaslighting.

5990
03:26:34,270 --> 03:26:35,770
All right, leave so we can join.

5991
03:26:36,570 --> 03:26:39,570
Oh, Jarrad, we did more damage than a pro player.

5992
03:26:39,730 --> 03:26:41,110
We should be proud of ourselves.

5993
03:26:41,690 --> 03:26:42,810
I gotta be proud.

5994
03:26:43,310 --> 03:26:45,350
Hey, I'm feeling pretty lucky today.

5995
03:26:45,450 --> 03:26:45,710
What the hell?

5996
03:26:45,730 --> 03:26:46,290
Hey, look, we're not.

5997
03:26:46,290 --> 03:26:48,250
We're not the last people in the lobby this time.

5998
03:26:48,450 --> 03:26:49,530
We're, we're getting better.

5999
03:26:49,810 --> 03:26:50,390
Let's go.

6000
03:26:51,650 --> 03:26:53,470
Unless, unless, Jarrad?

6001
03:26:54,250 --> 03:26:55,570
I'm joining, I'm joining, I'm joining.

6002
03:26:55,770 --> 03:26:56,010
Jarrad?

6003
03:26:56,830 --> 03:26:57,610
Jarrad, please?

6004
03:26:58,070 --> 03:26:59,210
I'm joining, wait, wait, wait.

6005
03:27:00,190 --> 03:27:00,630
Jarrad?

6006
03:27:00,830 --> 03:27:01,530
Wait, I can't go.

6007
03:27:01,830 --> 03:27:02,870
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

6008
03:27:02,870 --> 03:27:03,170
People are coming in.

6009
03:27:03,830 --> 03:27:04,830
I'm like, where's the code?

6010
03:27:04,990 --> 03:27:06,330
I've been here before.

6011
03:27:06,750 --> 03:27:07,610
Where's the code, where's the code?

6012
03:27:07,850 --> 03:27:09,390
Oh, this is K-Jammu.

6013
03:27:09,390 --> 03:27:10,850
He doesn't know where the code is.

6014
03:27:10,970 --> 03:27:12,430
It's not like- K-Jammu.

6015
03:27:12,990 --> 03:27:14,610
Here you go, I gave you the code.

6016
03:27:14,610 --> 03:27:16,610
I gave you the code, Jarrad.

6017
03:27:17,190 --> 03:27:19,010
Okay, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

6018
03:27:19,030 --> 03:27:19,570
What the fuck?

6019
03:27:19,710 --> 03:27:20,630
It's not letting me in.

6020
03:27:21,050 --> 03:27:22,510
We were flaming out.

6021
03:27:22,610 --> 03:27:23,550
We were so happy.

6022
03:27:23,830 --> 03:27:26,850
We were like, oh my god, I couldn't make it.

6023
03:27:26,950 --> 03:27:28,610
And then we're like, wait, where's Jarrad?

6024
03:27:28,930 --> 03:27:30,070
Where did he go?

6025
03:27:30,870 --> 03:27:31,670
Oh, whoops.

6026
03:27:32,090 --> 03:27:32,850
It's okay, guys.

6027
03:27:32,930 --> 03:27:34,150
We're still not last.

6028
03:27:34,350 --> 03:27:36,130
We're still not last.

6029
03:27:38,870 --> 03:27:39,670
It's fine.

6030
03:27:40,890 --> 03:27:42,030
All right, I'm gonna use the bathroom.

6031
03:27:42,170 --> 03:27:43,010
I'll be right back, guys.

6032
03:27:43,750 --> 03:27:44,310
Yeah, all right.

6033
03:27:44,310 --> 03:27:45,450
All right, okay.

6034
03:27:45,510 --> 03:27:47,910
Here's another deep, dark secret to Jarrad while I'm gone.

6035
03:27:47,970 --> 03:27:50,790
So you can feel like he feels like he'll fit in.

6036
03:27:50,790 --> 03:27:52,030
Bro, you cannot just stop me playing.

6037
03:27:52,030 --> 03:27:53,470
You can tell him a different secret.

6038
03:27:53,810 --> 03:27:56,830
You tell him a different secret so he feels the experience.

6039
03:27:59,650 --> 03:28:00,690
Uh, I don't have any...

6040
03:28:01,390 --> 03:28:02,770
You know what, you tell me.

6041
03:28:02,810 --> 03:28:04,350
You tell me what happened, bro.

6042
03:28:05,950 --> 03:28:07,410
We can build from this.

6043
03:28:07,710 --> 03:28:09,610
We can have a great chemistry from this.

6044
03:28:10,070 --> 03:28:12,030
I think I feel like we're gonna connect some more.

6045
03:28:12,030 --> 03:28:15,090
If we share each other's deep, dark secrets.

6046
03:28:18,090 --> 03:28:19,370
What do you mean?

6047
03:28:19,410 --> 03:28:19,470
No!

6048
03:28:19,950 --> 03:28:21,170
There's another one.

6049
03:28:21,550 --> 03:28:22,630
Oh, there's another one?

6050
03:28:23,170 --> 03:28:24,250
Does Toki know about this?

6051
03:28:24,710 --> 03:28:25,390
No, no.

6052
03:28:25,470 --> 03:28:25,910
Okay, okay.

6053
03:28:26,050 --> 03:28:29,190
This happened like a few months ago.

6054
03:28:29,630 --> 03:28:31,710
I was at a mall, right?

6055
03:28:32,330 --> 03:28:33,190
I was driving.

6056
03:28:33,470 --> 03:28:36,190
I was trying to get out after I bought something.

6057
03:28:37,130 --> 03:28:41,050
And in Indonesia, you need these like flashcards.

6058
03:28:41,050 --> 03:28:48,510
They're essentially like kind of debit cards specifically for parking and like all that stuff.

6059
03:28:49,270 --> 03:28:54,070
And I didn't have like enough balance in mine.

6060
03:28:54,350 --> 03:28:55,790
Oh, you have to charge it, right?

6061
03:28:56,210 --> 03:28:57,850
Yeah, like I have to fill it.

6062
03:28:58,170 --> 03:28:59,950
And I don't usually drive.

6063
03:29:00,130 --> 03:29:02,510
So I don't know how to actually fill it.

6064
03:29:02,670 --> 03:29:04,490
Like I've never really like done it before.

6065
03:29:05,230 --> 03:29:06,590
So you were there alone?

6066
03:29:06,770 --> 03:29:07,490
No one to guide you?

6067
03:29:07,510 --> 03:29:08,690
Yeah, no, it was just me.

6068
03:29:09,010 --> 03:29:10,590
But I was trying to leave, right?

6069
03:29:10,590 --> 03:29:12,190
And then I tapped my card.

6070
03:29:12,550 --> 03:29:14,090
And it's out of balance.

6071
03:29:14,290 --> 03:29:14,970
Oh, no!

6072
03:29:15,130 --> 03:29:15,530
Whoa!

6073
03:29:15,790 --> 03:29:17,570
I don't know what it was, but whoa!

6074
03:29:19,690 --> 03:29:20,650
I was out of balance.

6075
03:29:20,650 --> 03:29:21,190
Were you arrested?

6076
03:29:21,790 --> 03:29:25,110
No, but I don't know how to fill it, right?

6077
03:29:25,170 --> 03:29:26,550
And so I had to press the help button.

6078
03:29:27,090 --> 03:29:32,530
And you would think the help button just kind of like alerts the workers that, you know, someone's stuck.

6079
03:29:33,110 --> 03:29:35,150
Because I'm like holding up the line here.

6080
03:29:35,230 --> 03:29:36,490
Like there's only one exit.

6081
03:29:36,650 --> 03:29:40,410
And if I'm there and I can't move, everyone behind me is like...

6082
03:29:40,590 --> 03:29:41,190
stuck.

6083
03:29:41,450 --> 03:29:42,770
They just stuck behind me.

6084
03:29:42,770 --> 03:29:43,630
Oh, God.

6085
03:29:43,730 --> 03:29:52,470
So imagine my social anxiety when the help button just blares a fucking tornado siren just really loud as I'm pressing it.

6086
03:29:52,690 --> 03:29:53,930
I'm pressed, dude!

6087
03:29:54,930 --> 03:29:56,790
How can you get out of that?

6088
03:29:57,210 --> 03:29:59,670
Look, and then I'm pressing it.

6089
03:30:00,110 --> 03:30:02,150
And I'm like, wow, this is fucking loud.

6090
03:30:02,470 --> 03:30:03,870
And then I stopped pressing it.

6091
03:30:03,910 --> 03:30:09,950
And the people behind me just start, like, they just start blaring their horns.

6092
03:30:14,510 --> 03:30:20,410
And then eventually the guy did come, like after like two minutes of just absolute hell.

6093
03:30:20,550 --> 03:30:28,890
And then I'm like, uh, hey, how do I, how do I fill this card?

6094
03:30:29,610 --> 03:30:33,210
And let me tell you what he looked at me.

6095
03:30:33,650 --> 03:30:38,470
I looked at him and I have never felt such fucking shame.

6096
03:30:39,050 --> 03:30:46,730
Like, he, I don't, he took his card and he just tapped it on the machine and said, just go.

6097
03:30:49,110 --> 03:30:53,290
Bro, I didn't know someone was capable of delivering such shame, man.

6098
03:30:53,370 --> 03:30:59,410
Like, I might have left that place without paying the fee, but I lost my dignity that day.

6099
03:30:59,930 --> 03:31:01,390
I lost my dignity.

6100
03:31:01,770 --> 03:31:04,290
It was, it was traumatizing.

6101
03:31:05,410 --> 03:31:05,970
Dude!

6102
03:31:06,290 --> 03:31:07,270
Oh, my God.

6103
03:31:07,270 --> 03:31:07,530
Okay.

6104
03:31:07,590 --> 03:31:14,310
I think I have a similar experience because when I was in Canada, like, um, in here in South Elysium, like, uh, we, we don't have cards.

6105
03:31:14,390 --> 03:31:17,610
We don't use like debit cards type of like charge for like a transportation.

6106
03:31:18,130 --> 03:31:22,270
Like, uh, I, I held up a similar thing as you, like, I held up a line to the bus.

6107
03:31:22,470 --> 03:31:30,790
Like, I was, I was like, um, going like, uh, inside and then you have to tap this, this thing so you can charge it.

6108
03:31:30,790 --> 03:31:33,270
And like, uh, you can, you can basically go now much like yours.

6109
03:31:33,530 --> 03:31:35,590
And then like, uh, my card wasn't being read.

6110
03:31:35,590 --> 03:31:38,010
Like, oh my God.

6111
03:31:38,030 --> 03:31:38,330
Oh my God.

6112
03:31:38,350 --> 03:31:41,430
And like, and like the conductor was like, dude, hurry it up.

6113
03:31:41,470 --> 03:31:47,130
And like, I'm like, I don't even know where I put my wallet.

6114
03:31:47,330 --> 03:31:47,710
Like, oh my God.

6115
03:31:47,870 --> 03:31:48,870
The debit works, right?

6116
03:31:49,130 --> 03:31:49,450
Yes.

6117
03:31:49,590 --> 03:31:52,430
And like the dudes at the back were like scratching their heads.

6118
03:31:52,610 --> 03:31:53,690
Like, no, no, I got this.

6119
03:31:53,890 --> 03:31:54,550
I got this.

6120
03:31:56,990 --> 03:31:57,690
You know what?

6121
03:31:57,730 --> 03:31:58,570
You just, just sit down.

6122
03:31:58,650 --> 03:31:59,150
Just sit down.

6123
03:31:59,190 --> 03:31:59,730
I got this.

6124
03:32:05,590 --> 03:32:10,370
I got this, don't worry about it.

6125
03:32:10,390 --> 03:32:11,150
I know.

6126
03:32:13,750 --> 03:32:15,470
Like, I'm so like, I'm so sorry.

6127
03:32:18,310 --> 03:32:22,990
I just looked out the window thinking like, uh, nothing, nothing bad happened to me.

6128
03:32:24,370 --> 03:32:25,810
Like, just let me off.

6129
03:32:25,950 --> 03:32:26,690
Let me off, man.

6130
03:32:26,730 --> 03:32:27,490
I don't want you to run.

6131
03:32:27,550 --> 03:32:28,950
You're just like, I'm just going to walk.

6132
03:32:28,990 --> 03:32:29,630
It's fine.

6133
03:32:29,750 --> 03:32:30,610
I'll just walk.

6134
03:32:32,490 --> 03:32:34,530
I'm just thinking about just making me cringe.

6135
03:32:35,670 --> 03:32:37,330
Oh my God, good timing.

6136
03:32:37,670 --> 03:32:38,850
Our match starts.

6137
03:32:39,990 --> 03:32:42,770
Oh, we're world's edge first this time.

6138
03:32:43,710 --> 03:32:44,030
Okay.

6139
03:32:44,210 --> 03:32:44,550
All right.

6140
03:32:44,830 --> 03:32:45,170
All right.

6141
03:32:45,210 --> 03:32:45,990
It was time to lock.

6142
03:32:46,130 --> 03:32:49,430
We shared our darkest secrets and trauma.

6143
03:32:49,830 --> 03:32:50,810
Now we're so locked in.

6144
03:32:50,870 --> 03:32:52,030
We bonded as a team.

6145
03:32:52,790 --> 03:32:53,190
Yeah.

6146
03:32:53,330 --> 03:32:54,790
We're so locked in now.

6147
03:32:56,530 --> 03:32:57,890
Trauma bonding is what you call it.

6148
03:32:58,110 --> 03:32:58,870
Yeah, trauma bonding.

6149
03:32:59,130 --> 03:32:59,590
Exactly.

6150
03:33:00,190 --> 03:33:00,750
We're one.

6151
03:33:02,310 --> 03:33:03,110
Look at my trauma.

6152
03:33:03,110 --> 03:33:04,210
We understand each other's feelings now.

6153
03:33:04,210 --> 03:33:08,750
I like how my trauma was just my addiction to like Marvel Rivals.

6154
03:33:09,430 --> 03:33:11,730
We started off with that.

6155
03:33:16,190 --> 03:33:17,930
It's a good thing.

6156
03:33:18,030 --> 03:33:18,890
At least you're enjoying yourself.

6157
03:33:18,990 --> 03:33:20,630
It's just my trauma.

6158
03:33:22,590 --> 03:33:25,330
Yours is like actual public humiliation.

6159
03:33:29,010 --> 03:33:30,850
Hey, don't shame us on that.

6160
03:33:30,870 --> 03:33:33,730
That was a very vulnerable moment for us.

6161
03:33:33,730 --> 03:33:35,110
We're trauma bonding.

6162
03:33:35,630 --> 03:33:37,110
Trauma bonding.

6163
03:33:37,910 --> 03:33:39,970
I'm going to loot the bridge here.

6164
03:33:39,970 --> 03:33:41,090
I'm going to call yours trauma bonding.

6165
03:33:41,650 --> 03:33:44,270
It is trauma bonding, my guy.

6166
03:33:45,370 --> 03:33:46,850
It's so traumatic.

6167
03:33:48,050 --> 03:33:50,790
Durai, why did you land with him?

6168
03:33:53,690 --> 03:33:55,930
You're not supposed to be here.

6169
03:33:57,190 --> 03:33:59,290
Just loot into Eppy.

6170
03:33:59,770 --> 03:34:01,750
You can get the bottom of Eppy.

6171
03:34:02,650 --> 03:34:03,890
I'll go get the top.

6172
03:34:03,950 --> 03:34:06,030
Sorry, I forgot we were not playing in public.

6173
03:34:06,550 --> 03:34:10,350
I was like, what are you doing over there, Durai?

6174
03:34:10,390 --> 03:34:11,250
I don't know, man.

6175
03:34:11,470 --> 03:34:13,950
Suddenly the tournament feels so crazy and silly.

6176
03:34:15,290 --> 03:34:17,990
This is the part where it shouldn't feel that silly.

6177
03:34:18,410 --> 03:34:19,690
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

6178
03:34:19,910 --> 03:34:20,810
Okay, this time, this time.

6179
03:34:21,030 --> 03:34:22,910
Lock in, lock in, lock in, lock in.

6180
03:34:23,090 --> 03:34:24,990
This is a high-tier lobby now.

6181
03:34:25,750 --> 03:34:27,070
Stop dead, baby.

6182
03:34:28,330 --> 03:34:30,290
Maybe trauma bonding was a bad idea.

6183
03:34:30,530 --> 03:34:31,690
We became too silly.

6184
03:34:32,890 --> 03:34:34,170
Do you need a triple take?

6185
03:34:34,230 --> 03:34:35,350
I found a triple take for you.

6186
03:34:35,910 --> 03:34:37,190
Uh, I will take that.

6187
03:34:37,410 --> 03:34:37,870
All right.

6188
03:34:39,210 --> 03:34:40,010
Nice, all right.

6189
03:34:40,190 --> 03:34:41,890
I got energy ammo, if you guys want it.

6190
03:34:42,710 --> 03:34:43,750
Uh, yeah, I'll probably take all of that.

6191
03:34:43,750 --> 03:34:44,670
Oh, wait, no, no, that was a mistake.

6192
03:34:44,750 --> 03:34:45,410
I don't need too much.

6193
03:34:45,810 --> 03:34:47,150
Uh, any caches?

6194
03:34:47,410 --> 03:34:48,470
Okay, we're...

6195
03:34:48,470 --> 03:34:49,450
Closest this way, right?

6196
03:34:49,450 --> 03:34:51,810
Uh, we're gonna hit this cache here and then go into Monument.

6197
03:34:52,130 --> 03:34:52,570
All right.

6198
03:34:53,070 --> 03:34:54,010
Oh, there's a PK here.

6199
03:34:54,110 --> 03:34:54,890
We can start going now.

6200
03:34:55,250 --> 03:34:56,350
I'll take the PK, actually.

6201
03:34:56,430 --> 03:34:57,970
I'm gonna get, uh...

6202
03:34:59,070 --> 03:35:00,290
Hey, I got G7 Scout.

6203
03:35:00,350 --> 03:35:00,870
You guys want it?

6204
03:35:01,730 --> 03:35:02,130
No, I'm chilling.

6205
03:35:02,650 --> 03:35:03,450
No, I'm good.

6206
03:35:03,530 --> 03:35:05,590
I have, uh, 30-30 and PK.

6207
03:35:06,810 --> 03:35:07,030
Okay.

6208
03:35:07,350 --> 03:35:11,150
So, we better get a place where I can poke because I don't know what the fuck else to do.

6209
03:35:13,710 --> 03:35:14,630
All right, let's go.

6210
03:35:14,710 --> 03:35:15,410
Let's go up here.

6211
03:35:15,610 --> 03:35:16,230
Yeah, I'm going up.

6212
03:35:16,790 --> 03:35:17,350
We'll start leaving.

6213
03:35:19,690 --> 03:35:20,210
Come up, Druid.

6214
03:35:20,550 --> 03:35:22,630
We hit this cache and go into Monument.

6215
03:35:22,990 --> 03:35:24,870
I'm gonna... I'm looting these bins right now.

6216
03:35:25,270 --> 03:35:27,830
If you find any attachments for a...

6217
03:35:28,530 --> 03:35:32,190
If there's stuff here for a 30-30, let me know.

6218
03:35:33,190 --> 03:35:35,330
Yeah, I need a scope for my triple take as well.

6219
03:35:35,490 --> 03:35:35,990
I have a 1x.

6220
03:35:36,650 --> 03:35:37,670
I don't have any scope.

6221
03:35:38,410 --> 03:35:39,570
We can hit this zipline down here.

6222
03:35:39,730 --> 03:35:40,470
Just go straight into Monument.

6223
03:35:41,270 --> 03:35:41,570
All right.

6224
03:35:45,450 --> 03:35:46,170
I'm here.

6225
03:35:48,190 --> 03:35:48,910
Let's go.

6226
03:35:49,450 --> 03:35:50,090
Let's go.

6227
03:35:50,650 --> 03:35:55,310
I have to be a little bit careful in case Monument is still here, but it should be okay.

6228
03:35:56,050 --> 03:35:57,130
Just run left with me.

6229
03:35:57,130 --> 03:35:58,510
Yeah, I'm here with you.

6230
03:35:59,270 --> 03:36:00,730
They didn't loot this yet.

6231
03:36:02,830 --> 03:36:04,930
Yeah, I think they might have just already looted it then.

6232
03:36:05,410 --> 03:36:05,670
You guys go ahead and scan here.

6233
03:36:05,670 --> 03:36:08,470
Yeah, I mean this is top 10, so I won't be surprised.

6234
03:36:09,490 --> 03:36:12,030
Yeah, I saw people like over here.

6235
03:36:12,130 --> 03:36:14,250
There's a scope here, but not for us.

6236
03:36:15,530 --> 03:36:15,870
Okay.

6237
03:36:16,010 --> 03:36:17,030
Yeah, they're rotating to a sand site.

6238
03:36:17,110 --> 03:36:20,810
Just hit this console and we might go up this way.

6239
03:36:21,350 --> 03:36:22,230
I have a scope for you.

6240
03:36:22,330 --> 03:36:23,150
I found a 3x.

6241
03:36:23,390 --> 03:36:24,450
Oh, perfect.

6242
03:36:25,570 --> 03:36:26,610
You can just drop it wherever.

6243
03:36:27,250 --> 03:36:28,550
Yeah, I'll drop it here.

6244
03:36:28,830 --> 03:36:29,870
I'm waiting for Jared.

6245
03:36:32,330 --> 03:36:33,310
Yep, yep, yep.

6246
03:36:33,530 --> 03:36:33,670
Okay.

6247
03:36:35,610 --> 03:36:35,730
What?

6248
03:36:36,130 --> 03:36:36,530
I see you.

6249
03:36:36,930 --> 03:36:37,150
What?

6250
03:36:37,350 --> 03:36:37,790
It won't let me.

6251
03:36:37,850 --> 03:36:38,170
The ping!

6252
03:36:38,310 --> 03:36:38,890
Oh my god!

6253
03:36:39,130 --> 03:36:39,510
Ping!

6254
03:36:41,090 --> 03:36:41,490
Ping!

6255
03:36:41,750 --> 03:36:42,110
Oldie.

6256
03:36:43,030 --> 03:36:43,930
I'm holding it!

6257
03:36:43,990 --> 03:36:44,770
The ping isn't working!

6258
03:36:44,890 --> 03:36:45,810
The ping is going...

6259
03:36:45,810 --> 03:36:47,070
Oh, Jesus Christ.

6260
03:36:47,710 --> 03:36:48,330
There we go.

6261
03:36:50,130 --> 03:36:51,570
Oh my god, ping!

6262
03:36:51,810 --> 03:36:53,250
Guys, we got top five.

6263
03:36:53,370 --> 03:36:54,030
Remember that.

6264
03:36:56,750 --> 03:37:00,530
Listen, we're gonna hit this skip back and then we're rotating right here.

6265
03:37:00,770 --> 03:37:02,650
Remember we got top five.

6266
03:37:03,570 --> 03:37:06,170
Oh my god, it's literally failing me right now.

6267
03:37:07,030 --> 03:37:11,250
We want to be underneath this, like somewhere in countdown here.

6268
03:37:12,310 --> 03:37:15,090
Yeah, we just want to be like there, I think.

6269
03:37:15,430 --> 03:37:15,690
All right.

6270
03:37:15,890 --> 03:37:16,510
Okay, okay, okay.

6271
03:37:16,510 --> 03:37:17,050
All right, all right, all right.

6272
03:37:18,490 --> 03:37:19,510
Grab this cache.

6273
03:37:20,270 --> 03:37:21,110
Okay, I'll grab it.

6274
03:37:21,270 --> 03:37:21,950
Okay, it's you.

6275
03:37:22,350 --> 03:37:23,190
That's a gold Elstar.

6276
03:37:23,190 --> 03:37:24,310
An Elstar, yeah.

6277
03:37:25,330 --> 03:37:26,270
I'll take the Elstar.

6278
03:37:26,410 --> 03:37:27,270
You're not... I'll take it in.

6279
03:37:27,510 --> 03:37:31,330
I need to go up and grab this cache here and then we'll evac.

6280
03:37:31,590 --> 03:37:32,330
All right, I'm good.

6281
03:37:32,950 --> 03:37:35,390
There's someone scanning over at the hill house there.

6282
03:37:35,550 --> 03:37:35,810
All right.

6283
03:37:36,830 --> 03:37:37,690
Just climb up to me.

6284
03:37:38,150 --> 03:37:39,090
Oh, I'm heading over.

6285
03:37:39,750 --> 03:37:40,190
Not last!

6286
03:37:40,510 --> 03:37:41,010
Not last!

6287
03:37:41,630 --> 03:37:42,170
Not last!

6288
03:37:42,230 --> 03:37:43,630
Yeah, you're great, great, great!

6289
03:37:43,670 --> 03:37:44,150
Not last!

6290
03:37:44,390 --> 03:37:46,070
They scanned over at Fragus wall.

6291
03:37:47,110 --> 03:37:48,770
Okay, I'm right behind you.

6292
03:37:53,130 --> 03:37:54,390
That cache is...

6293
03:37:54,390 --> 03:37:55,670
You guys can just...

6294
03:37:55,670 --> 03:37:56,550
We want to go to the pink?

6295
03:37:56,750 --> 03:37:57,390
Wait a little bit.

6296
03:37:57,570 --> 03:37:59,270
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

6297
03:37:59,450 --> 03:38:00,270
Jump up, jump up, jump up!

6298
03:38:00,330 --> 03:38:00,530
Okay.

6299
03:38:01,050 --> 03:38:01,710
Okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna.

6300
03:38:05,450 --> 03:38:06,470
No, it's taken...

6301
03:38:08,370 --> 03:38:09,370
Is above them free?

6302
03:38:09,950 --> 03:38:11,390
Can we line up here and just bubble?

6303
03:38:11,550 --> 03:38:13,830
Okay, I don't know if Gerard can, but I can.

6304
03:38:15,150 --> 03:38:15,450
So...

6305
03:38:15,450 --> 03:38:15,850
Okay, wait.

6306
03:38:15,990 --> 03:38:17,090
Oh, shut the fuck up!

6307
03:38:17,090 --> 03:38:17,590
I can!

6308
03:38:18,150 --> 03:38:18,790
I can!

6309
03:38:19,930 --> 03:38:21,010
Okay, I made it, made it, made it.

6310
03:38:21,330 --> 03:38:22,230
Oh shit, they're shooting at me!

6311
03:38:22,410 --> 03:38:23,350
Yeah, bubble, bubble, bubble.

6312
03:38:23,350 --> 03:38:24,270
We have to drop down.

6313
03:38:24,310 --> 03:38:25,110
No, no, no.

6314
03:38:25,110 --> 03:38:25,710
Gibby, Gibby, Gibby!

6315
03:38:25,990 --> 03:38:26,310
Kill this!

6316
03:38:28,990 --> 03:38:29,730
He died, he died!

6317
03:38:29,950 --> 03:38:31,030
Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill.

6318
03:38:31,690 --> 03:38:31,990
Wait, wait!

6319
03:38:34,070 --> 03:38:34,950
Chill, chill, chill.

6320
03:38:34,970 --> 03:38:35,570
Two seconds, outside.

6321
03:38:35,870 --> 03:38:36,070
Okay.

6322
03:38:36,890 --> 03:38:37,850
That's fine, that's fine, that's fine.

6323
03:38:39,250 --> 03:38:40,750
Oh, fuck me.

6324
03:38:40,750 --> 03:38:40,930
I might be dead.

6325
03:38:40,930 --> 03:38:41,710
I might be dead here.

6326
03:38:41,930 --> 03:38:42,190
Yeah.

6327
03:38:42,810 --> 03:38:43,430
Oh my...

6328
03:38:43,430 --> 03:38:44,010
There's people downstairs.

6329
03:38:44,150 --> 03:38:46,630
Just don't jump down, don't jump down, don't jump down, don't jump down, don't jump down.

6330
03:38:47,070 --> 03:38:48,330
There's people, there's a full...

6331
03:38:48,330 --> 03:38:49,190
Oh, what?

6332
03:38:50,490 --> 03:38:50,810
What?

6333
03:38:51,470 --> 03:38:52,010
What happened?

6334
03:38:52,010 --> 03:38:53,030
It was the last.

6335
03:38:54,790 --> 03:38:56,210
And again, zero deaths.

6336
03:38:56,830 --> 03:38:58,370
Oh my god!

6337
03:38:58,810 --> 03:38:59,070
What?

6338
03:38:59,450 --> 03:39:01,090
Everybody was here!

6339
03:39:02,070 --> 03:39:02,950
Goddamn, again.

6340
03:39:02,990 --> 03:39:04,270
Why did they push?

6341
03:39:05,290 --> 03:39:07,970
Nah, nah, that's on me there.

6342
03:39:08,190 --> 03:39:10,110
We definitely shouldn't have done that.

6343
03:39:10,330 --> 03:39:16,110
I wanted to stabilize up top for two seconds, check if that spot was free, and if it wasn't, we just dropped down.

6344
03:39:16,510 --> 03:39:17,390
But then the Gibby...

6345
03:39:18,390 --> 03:39:19,610
I kidnapped the Gibby.

6346
03:39:19,710 --> 03:39:21,550
He walked out the door and I closed it behind him.

6347
03:39:22,010 --> 03:39:24,850
So we got the kill, and I was like, I think we can fight this.

6348
03:39:24,850 --> 03:39:25,630
Oh man.

6349
03:39:26,010 --> 03:39:27,670
Yeah, no, that team, that team died.

6350
03:39:28,050 --> 03:39:31,450
Dude, three teams died in that fight.

6351
03:39:31,990 --> 03:39:34,830
That one fight, we started three teams.

6352
03:39:36,070 --> 03:39:36,510
Really?

6353
03:39:36,510 --> 03:39:38,150
God, oh my god, they're so aggressive.

6354
03:39:38,170 --> 03:39:38,790
We literally started something.

6355
03:39:40,010 --> 03:39:42,670
If we go down, we're gonna take a few with us, you know?

6356
03:39:42,730 --> 03:39:45,370
We literally started something there.

6357
03:39:46,030 --> 03:39:46,910
Holy shit.

6358
03:39:47,290 --> 03:39:51,730
No, I was so surprised they still pushed in the end, the two solos.

6359
03:39:52,230 --> 03:39:53,630
Because they could have just...

6360
03:39:53,630 --> 03:39:55,350
What is going on with that team up there?

6361
03:39:57,410 --> 03:39:59,010
Oh man, I had such a good...

6362
03:39:59,010 --> 03:40:03,150
Oh man, I almost downed the two of them there, but they like closed the door back and had no nades.

6363
03:40:04,750 --> 03:40:06,090
Because I did like...

6364
03:40:06,090 --> 03:40:08,650
Yeah, they were like flesh, but then they closed the door.

6365
03:40:09,110 --> 03:40:10,710
Yeah, the Ashe was so low.

6366
03:40:10,870 --> 03:40:12,030
Yeah, I did...

6367
03:40:12,630 --> 03:40:14,010
Yeah, I did the hundred and...

6368
03:40:14,750 --> 03:40:17,170
I did 112 on the Ashe.

6369
03:40:17,970 --> 03:40:19,510
Good job, good job, good job.

6370
03:40:19,590 --> 03:40:20,130
You know what?

6371
03:40:20,230 --> 03:40:21,190
Oh, I did more than flame.

6372
03:40:21,270 --> 03:40:21,730
Let's go.

6373
03:40:22,010 --> 03:40:22,450
Let's go.

6374
03:40:25,510 --> 03:40:29,070
That 37 damage more, I'm proud of that.

6375
03:40:29,790 --> 03:40:30,870
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

6376
03:40:30,970 --> 03:40:31,770
It's not 37.

6377
03:40:32,090 --> 03:40:32,970
Proud of you, proud of you.

6378
03:40:34,070 --> 03:40:34,470
28.

6379
03:40:35,310 --> 03:40:35,970
28 more damage.

6380
03:40:35,970 --> 03:40:37,130
The 28 damage.

6381
03:40:37,250 --> 03:40:38,530
28 to 28.

6382
03:40:42,650 --> 03:40:43,530
I'll be right back.

6383
03:40:43,610 --> 03:40:44,050
Give me one second.

6384
03:40:44,170 --> 03:40:45,510
All right, all right, no problem.

6385
03:40:46,290 --> 03:40:46,890
All right.

6386
03:40:47,110 --> 03:40:47,930
You know what, Jarod?

6387
03:40:47,970 --> 03:40:48,370
That's fine.

6388
03:40:48,550 --> 03:40:48,970
It's just...

6389
03:40:48,970 --> 03:40:49,790
Remember, that's...

6390
03:40:49,790 --> 03:40:50,770
It's just game one.

6391
03:40:50,770 --> 03:40:52,230
It's just game one.

6392
03:40:53,390 --> 03:40:54,730
Yeah, yeah, I think...

6393
03:40:54,730 --> 03:40:57,630
I think it threw me off when we actually went to the pubs.

6394
03:40:57,850 --> 03:41:00,670
Like, suddenly the focus just went out the window.

6395
03:41:01,230 --> 03:41:01,970
Yeah, I suddenly...

6396
03:41:01,970 --> 03:41:03,310
Okay, okay, I gotta be careful.

6397
03:41:03,530 --> 03:41:04,230
All right, now after...

6398
03:41:04,230 --> 03:41:05,090
That's like a wake-up call.

6399
03:41:05,210 --> 03:41:06,530
Game one is like a wake-up call.

6400
03:41:06,990 --> 03:41:08,010
Do we still have a chance though?

6401
03:41:08,190 --> 03:41:08,710
Yeah, yeah.

6402
03:41:08,730 --> 03:41:09,070
Of course.

6403
03:41:09,310 --> 03:41:09,830
Yeah, of course.

6404
03:41:09,950 --> 03:41:11,090
I mean, we literally did well.

6405
03:41:11,090 --> 03:41:12,190
I thought we were gonna get kicked out after that horrible performance.

6406
03:41:12,190 --> 03:41:14,730
We only did well in three games out of the six.

6407
03:41:14,890 --> 03:41:16,310
So like, it should be...

6408
03:41:16,310 --> 03:41:17,830
And we got top five from that.

6409
03:41:18,670 --> 03:41:19,550
So it should be fine.

6410
03:41:21,850 --> 03:41:23,630
Jesus Christ, the way they shoot.

6411
03:41:24,370 --> 03:41:24,810
It's so insane.

6412
03:41:24,870 --> 03:41:25,610
They can just...

6413
03:41:25,610 --> 03:41:26,110
Oh, man.

6414
03:41:26,810 --> 03:41:28,350
They're shooting from far away.

6415
03:41:28,610 --> 03:41:29,090
That's nice.

6416
03:41:29,270 --> 03:41:29,930
And they're hitting their...

6417
03:41:31,290 --> 03:41:32,610
I can never...

6418
03:41:32,610 --> 03:41:33,730
I can never do that.

6419
03:41:33,930 --> 03:41:35,110
That's nice.

6420
03:41:35,490 --> 03:41:36,850
How do you even train your aim?

6421
03:41:36,990 --> 03:41:38,090
Like, do you just keep playing?

6422
03:41:38,310 --> 03:41:38,770
You just play...

6423
03:41:38,770 --> 03:41:40,530
Well, some people do aim trainer.

6424
03:41:40,690 --> 03:41:41,650
I just play the game.

6425
03:41:41,910 --> 03:41:44,150
I know I should do aim trainer to warm up.

6426
03:41:44,470 --> 03:41:45,210
Or like...

6427
03:41:45,210 --> 03:41:46,190
What's that...

6428
03:41:46,190 --> 03:41:48,970
What's that 1v1 R something?

6429
03:41:49,590 --> 03:41:49,890
Yeah.

6430
03:41:49,890 --> 03:41:51,570
Yeah, that program.

6431
03:41:53,470 --> 03:41:55,270
There's like 1v1 training.

6432
03:41:55,590 --> 03:41:57,050
Is it like free on Steam?

6433
03:41:57,170 --> 03:41:57,990
Because I remember like...

6434
03:41:57,990 --> 03:42:01,190
No, you have to download like the client.

6435
03:42:01,490 --> 03:42:01,710
Yeah.

6436
03:42:01,870 --> 03:42:02,530
Oh, okay.

6437
03:42:02,530 --> 03:42:04,410
Okay, so there's like Apex 1v1s.

6438
03:42:04,470 --> 03:42:05,770
But that one you had to download.

6439
03:42:05,990 --> 03:42:07,110
That's not a Steam thing.

6440
03:42:07,590 --> 03:42:09,710
But there's Kovacs and aim trainer.

6441
03:42:09,950 --> 03:42:11,290
And I think one of them is free, right?

6442
03:42:12,550 --> 03:42:13,070
Aim labs too.

6443
03:42:13,670 --> 03:42:14,410
Yeah, aim labs.

6444
03:42:14,470 --> 03:42:15,390
Aim labs is free.

6445
03:42:15,730 --> 03:42:16,210
If you want to...

6446
03:42:16,210 --> 03:42:16,650
That's like...

6447
03:42:16,650 --> 03:42:16,910
Oh, yeah, yeah.

6448
03:42:16,910 --> 03:42:17,190
That one.

6449
03:42:17,230 --> 03:42:19,050
I've been using aim labs like before.

6450
03:42:19,050 --> 03:42:19,670
Yeah, yeah.

6451
03:42:19,670 --> 03:42:21,150
But now I just don't.

6452
03:42:21,270 --> 03:42:21,730
Okay, all right.

6453
03:42:21,850 --> 03:42:23,210
But it is so good to use, right?

6454
03:42:23,490 --> 03:42:24,570
Yeah, I mean, I don't.

6455
03:42:24,650 --> 03:42:25,590
But like others do.

6456
03:42:27,050 --> 03:42:27,770
I just like...

6457
03:42:27,770 --> 03:42:28,310
Okay, all right.

6458
03:42:28,330 --> 03:42:29,190
At least it gives me a...

6459
03:42:29,190 --> 03:42:29,350
Okay.

6460
03:42:29,550 --> 03:42:31,930
I just pure grind the game until I get better aim.

6461
03:42:31,950 --> 03:42:32,770
Oh, shut the fuck up.

6462
03:42:32,850 --> 03:42:33,790
But like...

6463
03:42:33,790 --> 03:42:34,410
No, I mean, no.

6464
03:42:34,990 --> 03:42:35,950
It's a viable thing.

6465
03:42:35,990 --> 03:42:36,710
I don't.

6466
03:42:36,770 --> 03:42:37,010
I don't.

6467
03:42:37,150 --> 03:42:37,610
I'm built different.

6468
03:42:37,730 --> 03:42:38,410
I'm just a goalkeeper.

6469
03:42:38,870 --> 03:42:41,150
Until your aim adjusts to it.

6470
03:42:41,230 --> 03:42:43,050
But like other people...

6471
03:42:43,050 --> 03:42:46,870
If you want to be a consistent aimer, you just do aim labs or Kovacs.

6472
03:42:46,930 --> 03:42:48,750
Because like it helps you consistently.

6473
03:42:49,350 --> 03:42:53,170
Because like when I grind out a game, my aim only matches the game.

6474
03:42:54,530 --> 03:42:55,410
So like...

6475
03:42:55,410 --> 03:42:55,570
You're right.

6476
03:42:55,690 --> 03:42:55,930
Okay.

6477
03:42:56,270 --> 03:42:57,030
But then like...

6478
03:42:57,030 --> 03:43:01,630
But then like obviously it does translate well to other games, but not as good as it should.

6479
03:43:01,690 --> 03:43:02,470
Because I'm...

6480
03:43:02,470 --> 03:43:03,510
Mostly I'm...

6481
03:43:03,510 --> 03:43:04,590
I focus on tracking.

6482
03:43:04,990 --> 03:43:06,570
So when I do like project...

6483
03:43:06,570 --> 03:43:07,710
I can't do projectiles.

6484
03:43:07,830 --> 03:43:08,290
Because I'm...

6485
03:43:08,290 --> 03:43:10,250
I don't know the projectile speed and stuff.

6486
03:43:11,210 --> 03:43:12,870
Hearing this is like mind-boggling for me.

6487
03:43:12,930 --> 03:43:15,250
For a guy who never plays FPS as much.

6488
03:43:15,590 --> 03:43:16,090
Like a...

6489
03:43:16,090 --> 03:43:17,650
Whoa, you got to think that hard?

6490
03:43:17,890 --> 03:43:18,130
Yeah.

6491
03:43:18,190 --> 03:43:18,710
What the hell?

6492
03:43:18,710 --> 03:43:20,950
So like, you know, like sniper is projectile.

6493
03:43:21,410 --> 03:43:26,050
So you gotta know like the drop-off, the speed of your bullet and everything.

6494
03:43:26,350 --> 03:43:27,290
And you gotta like...

6495
03:43:27,290 --> 03:43:28,010
Like and then...

6496
03:43:28,010 --> 03:43:29,070
And then you have high ping.

6497
03:43:29,210 --> 03:43:30,710
You have to do lead...

6498
03:43:30,710 --> 03:43:31,250
Leading.

6499
03:43:31,490 --> 03:43:32,770
So you have to lead your shot.

6500
03:43:32,890 --> 03:43:33,230
What the fuck is leading?

6501
03:43:33,570 --> 03:43:35,190
So basically it's like you...

6502
03:43:35,190 --> 03:43:39,590
If you know you have high ping, you have to aim like little to like...

6503
03:43:39,590 --> 03:43:42,930
You have to aim further to where the target would go.

6504
03:43:43,990 --> 03:43:45,030
You shouldn't have to do...

6505
03:43:45,030 --> 03:43:46,170
Ping shouldn't really affect that.

6506
03:43:46,250 --> 03:43:48,090
It would if you have really high ping though.

6507
03:43:48,090 --> 03:43:49,190
It should, wouldn't it?

6508
03:43:49,650 --> 03:43:50,830
Because like I do that for...

6509
03:43:50,830 --> 03:43:51,610
Does it affect Apex?

6510
03:43:51,910 --> 03:43:53,010
I play sometimes...

6511
03:43:53,010 --> 03:43:54,430
Because I sometimes play in EU servers.

6512
03:43:55,010 --> 03:43:58,010
So I have to like compensate my aim for EU servers.

6513
03:43:59,010 --> 03:43:59,690
Oh goddamn.

6514
03:44:01,930 --> 03:44:05,430
Because like when I swap servers to EU, I have to lead...

6515
03:44:05,430 --> 03:44:06,030
Do leading.

6516
03:44:07,110 --> 03:44:09,690
Because I get like 250 ping for it.

6517
03:44:10,530 --> 03:44:11,050
Jesus.

6518
03:44:11,850 --> 03:44:17,470
Yeah, but like I'm used to playing various servers because in Overwatch I had to swap servers a lot just to...

6519
03:44:17,470 --> 03:44:19,510
Do VPNs like actually help at all?

6520
03:44:19,890 --> 03:44:20,370
Yeah, they do.

6521
03:44:20,690 --> 03:44:21,810
They can, yeah.

6522
03:44:21,810 --> 03:44:26,730
So if you use like a gaming VPN, it'll I guess like optimize your routing.

6523
03:44:27,670 --> 03:44:28,110
Oh.

6524
03:44:28,890 --> 03:44:29,310
Yeah.

6525
03:44:29,470 --> 03:44:32,190
I thought like gaming VPNs like barely work at all.

6526
03:44:32,230 --> 03:44:33,830
Like it'll make your game lagging.

6527
03:44:34,390 --> 03:44:36,470
You might be using a free one.

6528
03:44:37,530 --> 03:44:38,670
Oh, so that's why.

6529
03:44:38,670 --> 03:44:40,330
I never used like a VPN before.

6530
03:44:40,470 --> 03:44:42,430
You have to use like a paid gaming VPN.

6531
03:44:42,710 --> 03:44:44,430
Or I mean you can get like a trial for it.

6532
03:44:44,890 --> 03:44:45,870
I don't remember...

6533
03:44:45,870 --> 03:44:49,290
I remember there's one that everybody uses for Apex, but I don't remember the name for it.

6534
03:44:49,650 --> 03:44:50,370
It's uh...

6535
03:44:51,450 --> 03:44:51,870
Exitlag.

6536
03:44:52,110 --> 03:44:52,810
Yeah, Exitlag.

6537
03:44:52,870 --> 03:44:53,530
Oh yeah, Exitlag.

6538
03:44:53,770 --> 03:44:56,150
I've been seeing so many people like um...

6539
03:44:56,150 --> 03:44:58,290
promoting that shit on YouTube content, whatever.

6540
03:44:58,510 --> 03:44:59,690
There's another one too.

6541
03:44:59,870 --> 03:45:02,110
There's another one that's like uh...

6542
03:45:02,110 --> 03:45:05,670
I know there's one where like people say they use Exitlag, but they don't actually.

6543
03:45:07,410 --> 03:45:08,190
There's like...

6544
03:45:08,190 --> 03:45:10,830
There's like another one where like people are...

6545
03:45:11,570 --> 03:45:12,430
Registry of Lie?

6546
03:45:12,590 --> 03:45:13,030
Yeah.

6547
03:45:13,030 --> 03:45:16,050
Oh, I use all their money.

6548
03:45:16,110 --> 03:45:16,750
But I don't remember what it was.

6549
03:45:16,910 --> 03:45:18,270
Because like I tried it too.

6550
03:45:18,490 --> 03:45:19,750
Because I had to try...

6551
03:45:19,750 --> 03:45:23,910
Because I wanted to play on a specific Overwatch server, so I had to use the VPN.

6552
03:45:25,870 --> 03:45:28,810
Yeah, because there's like some games where you can't choose your server.

6553
03:45:29,170 --> 03:45:30,310
You have to like...

6554
03:45:30,310 --> 03:45:31,190
But like I mean...

6555
03:45:31,190 --> 03:45:33,170
I mean now it's just Overwatch that you have to do that.

6556
03:45:33,850 --> 03:45:35,970
Every other game you can choose your own server.

6557
03:45:36,170 --> 03:45:36,910
You still play Overwatch?

6558
03:45:37,150 --> 03:45:38,170
What's your peak on Overwatch?

6559
03:45:38,530 --> 03:45:39,850
Uh... 4600.

6560
03:45:42,150 --> 03:45:42,550
Oh...

6561
03:45:43,030 --> 03:45:43,610
In like...

6562
03:45:44,190 --> 03:45:44,390
4600 what?

6563
03:45:44,550 --> 03:45:44,830
Ping?

6564
03:45:45,530 --> 03:45:46,050
4600.

6565
03:45:46,170 --> 03:45:47,750
4600 is top 500, no?

6566
03:45:47,850 --> 03:45:48,450
Yeah, it is.

6567
03:45:48,490 --> 03:45:48,710
Yeah.

6568
03:45:48,910 --> 03:45:51,050
It was early season, so...

6569
03:45:51,050 --> 03:45:54,370
Yo, I'm just looking at this Bangalore shoot their shots.

6570
03:45:54,430 --> 03:45:56,910
They're like shooting like below and they're hitting.

6571
03:45:57,570 --> 03:45:57,990
Yeah.

6572
03:46:00,190 --> 03:46:02,370
But like it was when like everybody used to grind Overwatch.

6573
03:46:02,590 --> 03:46:05,370
So like top 500 was literally like 5,000.

6574
03:46:05,550 --> 03:46:08,090
Like rank one was like 5,000 or some shit.

6575
03:46:09,830 --> 03:46:11,470
Which is like the limit.

6576
03:46:11,470 --> 03:46:15,050
Like are you an OG Overwatch player?

6577
03:46:15,290 --> 03:46:16,970
Like the one before two or...

6578
03:46:16,970 --> 03:46:17,110
Yeah.

6579
03:46:17,290 --> 03:46:17,510
Yeah.

6580
03:46:17,550 --> 03:46:19,670
I've been playing Overwatch since season...

6581
03:46:19,670 --> 03:46:19,890
Oh, okay.

6582
03:46:19,970 --> 03:46:20,210
All right.

6583
03:46:20,710 --> 03:46:21,770
Since season two.

6584
03:46:23,370 --> 03:46:24,370
Well, I play...

6585
03:46:24,370 --> 03:46:27,450
I like I try to play Overwatch when season one, but I had not...

6586
03:46:27,450 --> 03:46:29,270
I didn't have a gaming PC back then.

6587
03:46:29,290 --> 03:46:31,430
So I was literally playing Lucio at 30 frames.

6588
03:46:31,930 --> 03:46:32,330
And then...

6589
03:46:32,330 --> 03:46:34,830
And then I got a gaming laptop.

6590
03:46:35,010 --> 03:46:36,150
Yeah, and then I get...

6591
03:46:36,150 --> 03:46:38,490
I got a gaming laptop for season two.

6592
03:46:38,710 --> 03:46:39,330
And then so I got...

6593
03:46:40,210 --> 03:46:41,230
And then I got...

6594
03:46:41,230 --> 03:46:43,250
I was playing Lucio at 60 frames.

6595
03:46:43,370 --> 03:46:43,950
Oh my God.

6596
03:46:43,990 --> 03:46:44,650
It was crazy.

6597
03:46:44,910 --> 03:46:47,590
60 frames from 30.

6598
03:46:47,830 --> 03:46:48,750
Oh my God.

6599
03:46:48,790 --> 03:46:50,130
That was fucking wild.

6600
03:46:51,710 --> 03:46:53,750
The gaming laptop is crazy.

6601
03:46:54,410 --> 03:46:57,330
Yeah, I fell into the rabbit hole as well.

6602
03:46:57,590 --> 03:46:58,590
Like just gaming laptop.

6603
03:46:58,750 --> 03:47:00,370
My God, that was the worst investment of my life.

6604
03:47:00,790 --> 03:47:01,310
Oh, yeah.

6605
03:47:01,630 --> 03:47:02,530
Yeah, so yeah.

6606
03:47:02,930 --> 03:47:05,010
And then after that, I got super addicted.

6607
03:47:05,130 --> 03:47:07,270
And then I got a real gaming PC after that.

6608
03:47:07,330 --> 03:47:09,650
Because I was just hard grinding Overwatch.

6609
03:47:10,450 --> 03:47:11,890
And now my addiction...

6610
03:47:11,890 --> 03:47:15,790
Like my addiction to Overwatch was so bad that like...

6611
03:47:17,310 --> 03:47:20,250
I was not doing stuff for sure.

6612
03:47:20,730 --> 03:47:21,890
Like I was not doing...

6613
03:47:21,890 --> 03:47:23,410
Like just like doing things I shouldn't be doing.

6614
03:47:23,410 --> 03:47:24,390
I mean, even right now.

6615
03:47:26,110 --> 03:47:28,870
I think it's safe to say you're a degenerate at heart.

6616
03:47:29,230 --> 03:47:29,910
Oh, yeah.

6617
03:47:30,090 --> 03:47:32,870
And yeah, I'm a rank degenerate.

6618
03:47:33,850 --> 03:47:35,970
Yeah, it takes one to notice one.

6619
03:47:36,150 --> 03:47:41,650
At the peak of my deadlock degeneracy, I straight up chose to sleep four hours a day.

6620
03:47:43,230 --> 03:47:46,330
Actually, actually like 17 hours of deadlock.

6621
03:47:46,390 --> 03:47:47,290
These motherfuckers.

6622
03:47:47,990 --> 03:47:49,390
When I have scrims as well.

6623
03:47:49,750 --> 03:47:50,250
Oh, yeah.

6624
03:47:50,470 --> 03:47:53,550
I literally...

6625
03:47:54,430 --> 03:48:00,190
Like when I got GM yesterday, I literally just played...

6626
03:48:00,190 --> 03:48:04,010
I played Marvel Rivals for like 10 plus hours straight.

6627
03:48:04,790 --> 03:48:06,270
And then like it was...

6628
03:48:06,270 --> 03:48:08,290
Yeah, and then it was like 8 a.m.

6629
03:48:08,350 --> 03:48:10,110
And I was like...

6630
03:48:10,110 --> 03:48:12,130
Because I was like, I'm not ending until I...

6631
03:48:12,130 --> 03:48:13,170
No, it was more than 10.

6632
03:48:13,230 --> 03:48:14,430
It was 15 hours.

6633
03:48:14,870 --> 03:48:16,030
It was 15 hours.

6634
03:48:16,170 --> 03:48:19,090
I was like, I'm not stopping until I fucking get GM.

6635
03:48:19,630 --> 03:48:21,050
And then I got to like...

6636
03:48:21,050 --> 03:48:21,890
Because I started...

6637
03:48:21,890 --> 03:48:23,730
The thing is, I started at 2 p.m.

6638
03:48:24,070 --> 03:48:26,250
And then I ended at 8 a.m.

6639
03:48:27,770 --> 03:48:29,110
What's wrong with you?

6640
03:48:29,530 --> 03:48:30,150
What the hell?

6641
03:48:30,190 --> 03:48:31,450
Because I was solo queuing.

6642
03:48:31,510 --> 03:48:32,330
I was solo queuing.

6643
03:48:32,490 --> 03:48:36,670
So I was like, I'm not stopping until I get GM.

6644
03:48:37,090 --> 03:48:39,410
And then the thing is...

6645
03:48:39,410 --> 03:48:40,790
That's some gold numbers, I can't lie.

6646
03:48:40,970 --> 03:48:46,150
And then the thing was, is that I had to go to the passport office right now.

6647
03:48:46,450 --> 03:48:47,670
Oh, yeah, that thing.

6648
03:48:47,670 --> 03:48:49,190
Did you just look dead?

6649
03:48:49,410 --> 03:48:50,710
I was like, no, I took my...

6650
03:48:50,710 --> 03:48:51,410
Bangs under your eyes like, what?

6651
03:48:52,590 --> 03:48:56,050
Okay, by the way, I didn't take a photo yet too.

6652
03:48:56,130 --> 03:48:57,730
So then I went to the passport office.

6653
03:48:57,870 --> 03:49:00,370
They had like a passport photo place.

6654
03:49:00,430 --> 03:49:02,350
And I just like, fuck it, let's take this photo.

6655
03:49:02,910 --> 03:49:06,510
And then there's an option to choose five.

6656
03:49:06,510 --> 03:49:10,970
And I was like, is this a photo I want for 10 years of my life?

6657
03:49:11,050 --> 03:49:12,330
I was like, fuck it.

6658
03:49:14,210 --> 03:49:20,050
It was like, post Marvel arrivals photo for the next 10 years.

6659
03:49:20,370 --> 03:49:21,850
Where's my fucking passport?

6660
03:49:23,310 --> 03:49:25,230
No, is that an 18 hour session?

6661
03:49:25,410 --> 03:49:27,950
I think it might have been an 18 hour session.

6662
03:49:28,170 --> 03:49:29,630
I think that's an 18 hour session.

6663
03:49:29,910 --> 03:49:31,190
I know, there was no way.

6664
03:49:31,330 --> 03:49:31,890
It was too...

6665
03:49:31,890 --> 03:49:32,590
Oh, it could be.

6666
03:49:32,790 --> 03:49:34,170
It was too fucking 8am.

6667
03:49:35,570 --> 03:49:36,970
Did you even sleep?

6668
03:49:37,330 --> 03:49:38,710
When was the last time you played Marvel?

6669
03:49:38,910 --> 03:49:40,810
I came back after...

6670
03:49:41,790 --> 03:49:43,430
Wait, it was literally today.

6671
03:49:43,570 --> 03:49:44,990
This happened all the time.

6672
03:49:45,830 --> 03:49:46,250
Wait, what?

6673
03:49:46,450 --> 03:49:47,470
Have you slept yet?

6674
03:49:47,590 --> 03:49:48,270
It happened today.

6675
03:49:49,310 --> 03:49:50,630
Wait, you haven't slept yet?

6676
03:49:50,810 --> 03:49:51,310
You're still...

6677
03:49:51,310 --> 03:49:52,430
No, I did sleep.

6678
03:49:52,550 --> 03:49:55,190
No, after I came back, I forgot much.

6679
03:49:55,390 --> 03:49:55,890
I fucking...

6680
03:49:55,890 --> 03:49:57,170
I'm concerned about this.

6681
03:49:57,970 --> 03:50:02,830
I went to bed and then I woke up.

6682
03:50:02,930 --> 03:50:04,150
I made my waiting room.

6683
03:50:04,150 --> 03:50:06,390
And then I queued up.

6684
03:50:07,330 --> 03:50:08,290
That was bad.

6685
03:50:08,650 --> 03:50:08,850
That is raw.

6686
03:50:09,530 --> 03:50:11,410
And I made my waiting room.

6687
03:50:11,530 --> 03:50:13,010
And then I was like...

6688
03:50:13,010 --> 03:50:16,430
And then I DMed Surefour if he wanted to play Marvel Rivals.

6689
03:50:16,690 --> 03:50:19,330
He was like, today I'm solo queuing.

6690
03:50:19,470 --> 03:50:19,950
And I was like, alright.

6691
03:50:20,090 --> 03:50:21,290
And then I watched his stream.

6692
03:50:21,510 --> 03:50:23,990
I was watching his stream playing Marvel Rivals.

6693
03:50:24,270 --> 03:50:25,690
While I was heading to bed.

6694
03:50:26,970 --> 03:50:27,230
Bro.

6695
03:50:29,810 --> 03:50:30,730
No way.

6696
03:50:31,890 --> 03:50:32,930
I literally...

6697
03:50:32,930 --> 03:50:34,210
I'd like to question your dreams.

6698
03:50:34,290 --> 03:50:36,910
I literally slept to Marvel Rivals.

6699
03:50:38,050 --> 03:50:38,610
Bro.

6700
03:50:39,270 --> 03:50:41,170
No, I used to do that for Apex.

6701
03:50:41,890 --> 03:50:43,250
I would...

6702
03:50:43,250 --> 03:50:45,490
When I was super addicted to Apex.

6703
03:50:45,710 --> 03:50:47,950
I would put up Apex streams to sleep to.

6704
03:50:49,150 --> 03:50:50,270
That's what...

6705
03:50:50,270 --> 03:50:51,150
Oh my god.

6706
03:50:51,450 --> 03:50:54,590
If I had your dedication, I'd have won five LANs by now.

6707
03:50:59,130 --> 03:51:02,910
I'm genuinely impressed and scared of what you're doing with your life.

6708
03:51:02,910 --> 03:51:04,830
No, I have a problem.

6709
03:51:04,830 --> 03:51:06,410
Did you sleep to Apex Legends streams?

6710
03:51:06,490 --> 03:51:09,410
No, when I get addicted to a game.

6711
03:51:09,610 --> 03:51:11,030
That's all I do.

6712
03:51:11,350 --> 03:51:13,430
I have a fucking problem.

6713
03:51:14,230 --> 03:51:15,290
Yes, you do.

6714
03:51:15,750 --> 03:51:17,510
I thought it's just like...

6715
03:51:17,510 --> 03:51:18,930
Longer gaming hours.

6716
03:51:19,010 --> 03:51:22,010
But even after gaming, you're still watching it?

6717
03:51:22,130 --> 03:51:22,350
Yeah.

6718
03:51:22,490 --> 03:51:24,630
Do you not get tired at all?

6719
03:51:24,710 --> 03:51:24,970
No.

6720
03:51:25,250 --> 03:51:27,690
I love it so much.

6721
03:51:29,610 --> 03:51:30,810
I just...

6722
03:51:31,450 --> 03:51:33,910
I love it so much.

6723
03:51:34,210 --> 03:51:35,750
It's so, so genuine.

6724
03:51:37,350 --> 03:51:39,070
I love it so much.

6725
03:51:39,510 --> 03:51:39,690
I cannot put this thing down.

6726
03:51:39,690 --> 03:51:42,630
I'm in a really abusive relationship with video games.

6727
03:51:42,870 --> 03:51:45,250
I'm in a really fucked up relationship with video games.

6728
03:51:45,250 --> 03:51:46,310
I can never understand that.

6729
03:51:46,570 --> 03:51:47,150
Oh my god.

6730
03:51:47,310 --> 03:51:49,450
If I'm tired, I just put it down.

6731
03:51:49,550 --> 03:51:51,210
I do not think about anything else.

6732
03:51:52,190 --> 03:51:53,230
Insane, crazy.

6733
03:51:53,490 --> 03:51:54,370
I don't understand it.

6734
03:51:54,650 --> 03:51:59,950
The amount of dopamine you get when you're doing good in a game like that is just ridiculous.

6735
03:51:59,950 --> 03:52:01,170
Yeah, you just can't stop.

6736
03:52:01,170 --> 03:52:03,290
You actually forget to do anything else.

6737
03:52:03,430 --> 03:52:06,130
You forget to eat, you forget to...

6738
03:52:06,130 --> 03:52:07,030
Yeah, I know.

6739
03:52:07,370 --> 03:52:11,290
And then for me, you really want to attain that goal.

6740
03:52:11,510 --> 03:52:11,610
And then for me, you really want to attain that goal.

6741
03:52:11,610 --> 03:52:14,130
So you just don't do anything else but that.

6742
03:52:14,330 --> 03:52:15,290
Non-stop.

6743
03:52:15,790 --> 03:52:16,370
That's me.

6744
03:52:16,490 --> 03:52:19,890
I literally couldn't work because all in my head was like, I need GM.

6745
03:52:20,390 --> 03:52:23,910
I was like, I have to get GM before I do anything.

6746
03:52:24,930 --> 03:52:26,490
That's inspiring as fuck.

6747
03:52:26,570 --> 03:52:27,590
That's motivational as shit.

6748
03:52:27,590 --> 03:52:29,270
Yeah, but I wasn't doing anything else.

6749
03:52:29,750 --> 03:52:34,570
I don't know if that's motivational or inspiring.

6750
03:52:35,050 --> 03:52:36,110
I have other obligations.

6751
03:52:36,710 --> 03:52:40,770
That is an addiction and a problem, okay?

6752
03:52:42,390 --> 03:52:45,910
Addiction and a problem is a problem when you don't get anything out of it.

6753
03:52:46,050 --> 03:52:47,570
You're winning because of that.

6754
03:52:47,870 --> 03:52:49,130
That is nothing, man.

6755
03:52:49,650 --> 03:52:50,950
What does that even mean?

6756
03:52:51,070 --> 03:52:51,750
You're making history.

6757
03:52:53,070 --> 03:52:54,810
Come on, you're making history.

6758
03:52:54,810 --> 03:52:55,690
Listen, listen.

6759
03:52:55,930 --> 03:52:57,630
It takes one to know one.

6760
03:52:57,810 --> 03:53:00,210
I know addiction when I see it, okay?

6761
03:53:00,590 --> 03:53:03,990
But you still keep doing it because you know, it gives you the good shit.

6762
03:53:04,110 --> 03:53:04,730
The good feeling.

6763
03:53:05,270 --> 03:53:08,090
That is peak life right there, okay?

6764
03:53:08,210 --> 03:53:09,070
You don't understand.

6765
03:53:09,590 --> 03:53:13,070
There is nothing that will bring you greater joy.

6766
03:53:13,610 --> 03:53:13,970
It's true.

6767
03:53:14,430 --> 03:53:15,890
There's nothing else.

6768
03:53:16,650 --> 03:53:23,230
I could marry and have kids and I could stare my newborn son in the eyes.

6769
03:53:23,230 --> 03:53:26,150
But it's not the same as when you're alive.

6770
03:53:27,090 --> 03:53:31,850
And I still wouldn't have as much fun as gaming for 18 hours straight.

6771
03:53:33,270 --> 03:53:34,970
You don't get it, okay?

6772
03:53:35,070 --> 03:53:36,370
You don't have this addiction.

6773
03:53:37,070 --> 03:53:39,110
Yeah, but it's fascinating to listen to.

6774
03:53:39,470 --> 03:53:40,390
Oh, whoa, it's over.

6775
03:53:40,770 --> 03:53:41,370
It's over.

6776
03:53:41,830 --> 03:53:45,710
It was very interesting listening to that.

6777
03:53:46,710 --> 03:53:51,190
You don't want to go into the hell hole that we're stuck in.

6778
03:53:53,230 --> 03:53:54,070
It's not a fun one.

6779
03:53:54,290 --> 03:53:55,750
Hearing it actually makes it look fun.

6780
03:53:56,170 --> 03:53:58,510
Because you guys are just genuinely enjoying it.

6781
03:53:58,850 --> 03:54:02,150
I literally played ranked for 15 hours.

6782
03:54:02,830 --> 03:54:04,670
No, 18 hours.

6783
03:54:06,030 --> 03:54:06,910
It's nuts.

6784
03:54:06,950 --> 03:54:08,470
But I kind of sort of get it.

6785
03:54:08,530 --> 03:54:10,170
You know the dopamine you get from that.

6786
03:54:10,230 --> 03:54:12,070
I want to have that feeling too.

6787
03:54:12,330 --> 03:54:13,270
No, no, listen.

6788
03:54:13,850 --> 03:54:15,430
You don't want this, man.

6789
03:54:15,950 --> 03:54:17,130
You don't want this, bro.

6790
03:54:17,270 --> 03:54:17,690
You see it.

6791
03:54:17,690 --> 03:54:25,050
You see, when we talk about the dopamine, that's like 10% of that.

6792
03:54:27,770 --> 03:54:31,910
90% is pure hate and frustration.

6793
03:54:34,810 --> 03:54:36,210
It's fine.

6794
03:54:36,430 --> 03:54:38,530
It's what makes the dopamine better.

6795
03:54:38,910 --> 03:54:39,750
Yeah, exactly.

6796
03:54:40,070 --> 03:54:46,050
You gotta get through the fucking pain to get that high.

6797
03:54:47,690 --> 03:54:50,550
That one hit of high right there.

6798
03:54:51,130 --> 03:54:53,130
It makes everything okay.

6799
03:54:53,550 --> 03:54:58,130
I guess it's worth it because once you get to that point, I feel like I won't stop either.

6800
03:55:01,590 --> 03:55:04,390
Just that taste of victory makes me want to keep going.

6801
03:55:04,610 --> 03:55:05,110
I get it.

6802
03:55:05,210 --> 03:55:07,270
That one victory we had there.

6803
03:55:07,570 --> 03:55:10,610
I don't want my addiction to be on Apex.

6804
03:55:10,870 --> 03:55:13,670
On something other than Apex.

6805
03:55:13,890 --> 03:55:15,770
Maybe something else but not this.

6806
03:55:15,770 --> 03:55:17,490
As long as it's not League.

6807
03:55:18,410 --> 03:55:26,510
Dude, okay, actually having the taste of victory literally a while ago, I know it's been long ago but I still feel it right now.

6808
03:55:26,570 --> 03:55:27,870
I kind of want to play some more.

6809
03:55:30,170 --> 03:55:33,590
Literally after the stream, I think I might play again.

6810
03:55:34,490 --> 03:55:35,950
It activated something.

6811
03:55:36,450 --> 03:55:48,610
But I'm not in a level of an addiction way towards yours but I genuinely want to keep improving because just seeing people just shoot the shit and win, I want that achievement in life.

6812
03:55:48,810 --> 03:55:49,870
I want that.

6813
03:55:50,030 --> 03:55:52,070
It actually genuinely looks pretty fun.

6814
03:55:52,190 --> 03:55:53,170
He has the passion.

6815
03:55:54,010 --> 03:55:55,330
Yeah, yeah.

6816
03:55:55,730 --> 03:55:58,730
We ended up doing the opposite of what we were trying to do.

6817
03:56:02,110 --> 03:56:05,850
I stream 11 hours every single time.

6818
03:56:06,030 --> 03:56:08,010
If you go to my channel, it's like fucking 11 hour streams.

6819
03:56:09,050 --> 03:56:11,550
It's like my third 11 hour stream.

6820
03:56:12,170 --> 03:56:14,670
When I got here, I was barely running.

6821
03:56:15,350 --> 03:56:16,350
It's today.

6822
03:56:16,610 --> 03:56:18,470
I thought it's literally Saturday JST.

6823
03:56:18,750 --> 03:56:21,130
I mean, it is also Saturday JST.

6824
03:56:24,450 --> 03:56:26,590
It's also Saturday JST.

6825
03:56:26,830 --> 03:56:31,210
If we don't get top 10, it's also Saturday JST.

6826
03:56:31,610 --> 03:56:32,450
No, no, we gotta win.

6827
03:56:32,990 --> 03:56:34,270
Okay, locking in.

6828
03:56:34,290 --> 03:56:35,330
I gotta lock in right now.

6829
03:56:35,730 --> 03:56:37,270
Oh my god, you're right.

6830
03:56:37,370 --> 03:56:39,850
I literally have something very important tomorrow.

6831
03:56:39,850 --> 03:56:42,390
And if we don't win, holy crap.

6832
03:56:43,610 --> 03:56:44,830
Flame, you heard him.

6833
03:56:46,230 --> 03:56:48,270
I'm gonna throw every game.

6834
03:56:52,730 --> 03:56:58,110
I think we should just start sprinting at Klamathizer without guns.

6835
03:56:59,850 --> 03:57:04,730
Flame had so much fun, he wants to do it all over again tomorrow.

6836
03:57:04,730 --> 03:57:10,510
He wants to do it all over again.

6837
03:57:11,150 --> 03:57:11,630
No!

6838
03:57:13,050 --> 03:57:13,850
Please, okay, okay.

6839
03:57:13,910 --> 03:57:14,710
I'm gonna focus right now.

6840
03:57:14,810 --> 03:57:15,950
Focus, focus, focus.

6841
03:57:17,090 --> 03:57:18,870
Like, I don't give a shit.

6842
03:57:18,990 --> 03:57:19,810
I'm gonna focus.

6843
03:57:20,310 --> 03:57:23,690
I'm gonna follow everything down to the fucking T.

6844
03:57:24,110 --> 03:57:25,150
That's what I'm gonna do today.

6845
03:57:26,370 --> 03:57:27,190
Focus, focus.

6846
03:57:27,330 --> 03:57:30,170
Alright, we believe in you.

6847
03:57:30,510 --> 03:57:33,150
Alright, I'm locked in.

6848
03:57:33,150 --> 03:57:35,930
We're sprinting at Klamathizer and giving them free kill points.

6849
03:57:39,030 --> 03:57:40,910
You said you were gonna listen, right?

6850
03:57:42,730 --> 03:57:44,670
You're really not gonna listen to your IGL?

6851
03:57:45,390 --> 03:57:47,330
You're not gonna listen to your IGL, man?

6852
03:57:51,250 --> 03:57:52,090
Okay, fine.

6853
03:57:52,230 --> 03:57:54,610
If it's for the sake of the team, I have to.

6854
03:57:54,830 --> 03:57:55,570
You gotta focus up.

6855
03:57:55,650 --> 03:57:56,110
You gotta listen.

6856
03:57:56,210 --> 03:57:58,830
When we say Rez, you gotta Rez.

6857
03:57:58,890 --> 03:58:00,130
Yes, Rez, Rez!

6858
03:58:00,690 --> 03:58:02,690
Alright, don't land next to...

6859
03:58:02,690 --> 03:58:04,350
Don't land next to the flame.

6860
03:58:05,010 --> 03:58:07,170
You have to land like here, I think.

6861
03:58:07,490 --> 03:58:10,340
You start at my yellow ping, like on the...

6862
03:58:12,310 --> 03:58:16,190
It's like underneath the construction building thing.

6863
03:58:16,850 --> 03:58:19,090
And then you just loot around the bottom and then hit console.

6864
03:58:20,030 --> 03:58:20,570
Okay, okay, okay.

6865
03:58:21,830 --> 03:58:23,350
Oh, I have 300 ping this game.

6866
03:58:23,410 --> 03:58:23,930
That's not good.

6867
03:58:24,010 --> 03:58:24,610
Oh, that's not good.

6868
03:58:25,610 --> 03:58:27,110
Oh, that is very bad.

6869
03:58:27,350 --> 03:58:29,150
I think I just have really bad routing.

6870
03:58:29,690 --> 03:58:30,170
Oh, no.

6871
03:58:31,950 --> 03:58:35,270
Maybe people will die and then things will be okay.

6872
03:58:36,810 --> 03:58:37,570
I don't know.

6873
03:58:37,630 --> 03:58:45,450
I know that's not how routing works, but like maybe maybe they'll just fix it so when more people are dead...

6874
03:58:45,450 --> 03:58:46,350
I got an R301.

6875
03:58:46,410 --> 03:58:46,890
Who needs it?

6876
03:58:47,130 --> 03:58:48,610
I got a Nemesis.

6877
03:58:48,850 --> 03:58:49,290
We're fine.

6878
03:58:51,490 --> 03:58:53,530
I have a purple bolt.

6879
03:58:56,330 --> 03:58:57,730
Yeah, I'm gonna need that.

6880
03:59:03,440 --> 03:59:04,140
Let's see.

6881
03:59:04,620 --> 03:59:05,020
Yeah.

6882
03:59:06,080 --> 03:59:07,560
This is gonna be a tough game.

6883
03:59:07,620 --> 03:59:08,120
Can I scan it?

6884
03:59:08,900 --> 03:59:10,080
Yeah, just scan it as soon as you can.

6885
03:59:12,880 --> 03:59:14,120
You got this, I believe.

6886
03:59:14,660 --> 03:59:15,740
There's a triple take here, too.

6887
03:59:16,860 --> 03:59:19,100
Oh, zone's on top of us.

6888
03:59:19,220 --> 03:59:20,220
Oh, we got hurt.

6889
03:59:20,540 --> 03:59:23,000
Yeah, I'm gonna craft and then hold.

6890
03:59:24,320 --> 03:59:25,740
We wanna go up, right?

6891
03:59:25,740 --> 03:59:27,780
Alright, I'm going up now.

6892
03:59:32,250 --> 03:59:33,290
Where do you wanna hold?

6893
03:59:33,350 --> 03:59:33,750
Right here?

6894
03:59:34,670 --> 03:59:35,310
No, no, no.

6895
03:59:35,850 --> 03:59:36,710
On the yellow.

6896
03:59:37,410 --> 03:59:37,930
Okay.

6897
03:59:38,390 --> 03:59:39,510
I'll head over then.

6898
03:59:45,060 --> 03:59:48,100
Jordan, you need to come with me so you can do walls and stuff.

6899
03:59:49,240 --> 03:59:50,980
Before the other team shows up.

6900
03:59:51,900 --> 03:59:52,560
Alright, alright.

6901
03:59:53,200 --> 04:00:00,040
I'm gonna loot those bins and then I hope everything will be fine because people rotate so fast.

6902
04:00:00,880 --> 04:00:01,180
Yeah.

6903
04:00:01,740 --> 04:00:02,840
There's a mastiff here.

6904
04:00:04,340 --> 04:00:06,000
I'm gonna keep a card just in case.

6905
04:00:08,420 --> 04:00:08,860
Actually...

6906
04:00:08,860 --> 04:00:10,080
I need a scope, I have no scope.

6907
04:00:10,320 --> 04:00:12,200
I have 3x, I can give you 3x.

6908
04:00:12,500 --> 04:00:17,320
I'm gonna get the mastiff just because I'm Gibby.

6909
04:00:18,020 --> 04:00:19,080
Here, I'll drop a 3x.

6910
04:00:20,900 --> 04:00:22,600
We need to stay on the height, guys.

6911
04:00:23,660 --> 04:00:24,360
Okay, thank you.

6912
04:00:25,300 --> 04:00:26,660
I took the 3x.

6913
04:00:26,660 --> 04:00:27,880
Okay, thank you.

6914
04:00:29,040 --> 04:00:30,840
Just give me any sight.

6915
04:00:31,260 --> 04:00:32,920
I only have 36 energy.

6916
04:00:33,240 --> 04:00:34,840
I never got a chance to loot more energy.

6917
04:00:35,300 --> 04:00:37,140
I'm giving you 40 here.

6918
04:00:37,740 --> 04:00:39,580
Just start setting up rampart covers.

6919
04:00:41,060 --> 04:00:43,760
There's a redeploy but I don't know where they ran to.

6920
04:00:44,280 --> 04:00:46,540
Tell them where to set up the walls.

6921
04:00:48,240 --> 04:00:51,760
Just put them on the periphery for presence for now.

6922
04:00:52,440 --> 04:00:54,740
You guys have to make sure you hold this northwest side.

6923
04:00:54,740 --> 04:00:57,180
I'm holding east and south.

6924
04:00:57,360 --> 04:01:00,040
Just get walls down on the northwest first.

6925
04:01:00,740 --> 04:01:03,820
Make sure no one can push us and then you can start putting walls down on me.

6926
04:01:04,620 --> 04:01:06,100
I don't know if that's a good wall but okay.

6927
04:01:08,220 --> 04:01:12,300
Make it so that people from this house can see it.

6928
04:01:15,640 --> 04:01:16,520
Scanning, scanning, scanning.

6929
04:01:16,700 --> 04:01:17,660
Aw, he bubbed.

6930
04:01:17,680 --> 04:01:19,200
Give me a shot at.

6931
04:01:21,280 --> 04:01:22,400
I'm kinda far.

6932
04:01:22,400 --> 04:01:23,360
This one.

6933
04:01:24,140 --> 04:01:25,680
That should be fine.

6934
04:01:26,000 --> 04:01:27,760
There's people underneath house here.

6935
04:01:29,260 --> 04:01:30,340
Shooting, trying to shoot me.

6936
04:01:30,820 --> 04:01:31,060
Yep.

6937
04:01:32,240 --> 04:01:33,360
They're in this house.

6938
04:01:34,460 --> 04:01:35,700
Okay, should I go to you?

6939
04:01:36,820 --> 04:01:38,240
Uh, yeah.

6940
04:01:38,280 --> 04:01:39,960
You can start putting some covers down on me.

6941
04:01:40,360 --> 04:01:40,940
Okay, okay, okay.

6942
04:01:41,280 --> 04:01:43,280
I'm in white armor so this is a bit bad.

6943
04:01:45,180 --> 04:01:45,660
Yeah.

6944
04:01:46,480 --> 04:01:48,060
Very risky setting up there, Doki.

6945
04:01:48,460 --> 04:01:49,080
Yeah, I know.

6946
04:01:49,080 --> 04:01:54,860
But I can't see properly on the other side so I feel like I'm worried that...

6947
04:01:54,860 --> 04:01:55,900
Oh, people behind us!

6948
04:01:57,040 --> 04:02:00,960
Yeah, yeah, you have to give Doki a rampart cover.

6949
04:02:01,680 --> 04:02:01,860
Okay.

6950
04:02:02,180 --> 04:02:03,480
Just sit out there.

6951
04:02:04,560 --> 04:02:05,800
I need a cover right here.

6952
04:02:08,820 --> 04:02:10,540
There's people right here crafting.

6953
04:02:15,910 --> 04:02:18,750
I don't know if I can cover the left side though.

6954
04:02:18,890 --> 04:02:19,810
I'm worried about that.

6955
04:02:21,050 --> 04:02:22,830
I'm worried I might get walked up on on the left.

6956
04:02:25,330 --> 04:02:25,730
Yeah.

6957
04:02:26,810 --> 04:02:29,110
You guys just double stay there and keep looking.

6958
04:02:30,710 --> 04:02:33,210
Careful, you're in the open, Jared, so you have to be careful.

6959
04:02:33,610 --> 04:02:35,050
Put a wall right here.

6960
04:02:36,190 --> 04:02:38,670
Yeah, put a wall next to you so you can sit up top.

6961
04:02:42,490 --> 04:02:43,490
I'll look to the right.

6962
04:02:43,630 --> 04:02:47,050
I'll look down here, you look to the left, Jared, and you look to the left.

6963
04:02:47,430 --> 04:02:51,810
So move your cover so that you're okay on your right side as well as your left.

6964
04:02:55,960 --> 04:02:56,940
So I'm on Sheila.

6965
04:02:57,280 --> 04:02:59,200
I'm using Sheila over on my red ping.

6966
04:02:59,320 --> 04:03:02,220
There's people on the high ground on Cito.

6967
04:03:04,360 --> 04:03:04,820
Yep.

6968
04:03:11,450 --> 04:03:14,890
I have like 60 energy so I'm not going to poke much.

6969
04:03:16,170 --> 04:03:17,170
What gun do you have?

6970
04:03:17,430 --> 04:03:18,750
A Nemesis, that's why.

6971
04:03:19,510 --> 04:03:23,370
Yeah, I thought I was going to find more energy but I didn't.

6972
04:03:23,370 --> 04:03:24,810
It's fine, it's fine.

6973
04:03:25,110 --> 04:03:26,590
Epicenter has really bad loot.

6974
04:03:27,110 --> 04:03:32,290
Yeah, I didn't realize how bad it was because I had a carbine on me, but I was like I can do a Nemesis.

6975
04:03:32,930 --> 04:03:35,530
Okay, I see someone running over there.

6976
04:03:36,510 --> 04:03:38,030
Shoot them so they won't come to us.

6977
04:03:39,050 --> 04:03:41,070
Yeah, just shoot them, show presence.

6978
04:03:43,630 --> 04:03:45,250
We have a really good spawn here.

6979
04:03:45,330 --> 04:03:48,730
All we have to do is just not get walked up on and die like in that Stormpoint game.

6980
04:03:50,330 --> 04:03:57,010
Yeah, so we gotta make sure I'm just looking down here and you just keep looking at where you're looking, Jerry.

6981
04:03:58,330 --> 04:03:59,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6982
04:03:59,670 --> 04:04:02,110
Does showing presence actually bait them?

6983
04:04:02,410 --> 04:04:08,150
No, it stops them from coming to us because all we want to do right now is just defend our position.

6984
04:04:08,770 --> 04:04:11,570
It makes them scared to run into us.

6985
04:04:12,430 --> 04:04:13,450
That's basically it.

6986
04:04:15,530 --> 04:04:17,130
So it's just a waiting game now.

6987
04:04:17,350 --> 04:04:20,670
You just gotta... if you see somebody just shoot them and let us know.

6988
04:04:21,390 --> 04:04:22,950
Yeah, keep an eye on your ammo though.

6989
04:04:23,030 --> 04:04:24,110
You don't wanna lose everything.

6990
04:04:24,750 --> 04:04:25,390
Just poke.

6991
04:04:28,690 --> 04:04:30,610
Do you know where your R301 is?

6992
04:04:31,670 --> 04:04:32,410
No, I don't.

6993
04:04:32,550 --> 04:04:34,750
It's all the way down here, but there's a team right here.

6994
04:04:34,990 --> 04:04:36,510
I have an R301 if you want.

6995
04:04:36,730 --> 04:04:37,770
No, that's fine.

6996
04:04:37,830 --> 04:04:38,390
Just keep yours.

6997
04:04:39,210 --> 04:04:41,290
Because I don't have much ammo for my energy gun.

6998
04:04:42,410 --> 04:04:44,110
Actually, it might be worth just making a swap.

6999
04:04:45,450 --> 04:04:47,650
I'm gonna swap my gun with you and you just pick it up.

7000
04:04:49,710 --> 04:04:51,050
Here, pick up the gun.

7001
04:04:52,250 --> 04:04:52,670
Okay, here.

7002
04:04:53,310 --> 04:04:54,290
Just drop it, yeah?

7003
04:04:54,590 --> 04:04:55,270
Take it here.

7004
04:04:55,590 --> 04:04:55,830
Ammo.

7005
04:04:56,890 --> 04:04:57,310
Okay.

7006
04:05:00,890 --> 04:05:02,650
Okay, here.

7007
04:05:02,790 --> 04:05:04,150
I dropped all of it.

7008
04:05:06,270 --> 04:05:07,170
Thank you.

7009
04:05:13,240 --> 04:05:14,740
Holy shit, you have 403?

7010
04:05:16,640 --> 04:05:17,960
He like ran this way.

7011
04:05:22,580 --> 04:05:23,060
Okay.

7012
04:05:23,060 --> 04:05:23,980
Trying to see where they're going.

7013
04:05:24,360 --> 04:05:25,620
There's a team right here.

7014
04:05:27,160 --> 04:05:28,120
I'm gonna...

7015
04:05:28,120 --> 04:05:28,860
Oh, shit.

7016
04:05:29,060 --> 04:05:29,220
Whoops.

7017
04:05:29,740 --> 04:05:31,180
I actually punched it.

7018
04:05:33,420 --> 04:05:34,860
They're fighting down here.

7019
04:05:34,880 --> 04:05:35,720
Hope it doesn't break.

7020
04:05:37,220 --> 04:05:38,080
It's fine.

7021
04:05:39,720 --> 04:05:42,100
I actually punched it because I was trying to swap my gun.

7022
04:05:43,220 --> 04:05:45,500
Uh, can you come over here for a few seconds?

7023
04:05:45,700 --> 04:05:46,640
Okay, do I?

7024
04:05:47,140 --> 04:05:47,780
Yeah, okay.

7025
04:05:48,120 --> 04:05:50,000
Oh, I'll stay, I'll stay, I'll stay.

7026
04:05:51,840 --> 04:05:54,040
Press X on this and then place another one in the same spot.

7027
04:05:55,720 --> 04:05:57,880
You have to take over Gerard's angle for a little bit.

7028
04:05:58,080 --> 04:05:59,000
Yeah, I'm taking it over now.

7029
04:06:00,520 --> 04:06:01,740
Getting shot from the bridge.

7030
04:06:01,980 --> 04:06:04,560
You can take these two out and then just replace them in the same spot.

7031
04:06:05,140 --> 04:06:05,900
Just press X on them.

7032
04:06:09,260 --> 04:06:10,740
Take this one on the left as well.

7033
04:06:11,200 --> 04:06:12,160
It got shot at.

7034
04:06:14,520 --> 04:06:16,300
Nice, thank you.

7035
04:06:16,660 --> 04:06:17,320
Perfect.

7036
04:06:21,710 --> 04:06:22,550
What the?

7037
04:06:23,370 --> 04:06:24,430
Oh my

7038
04:06:31,560 --> 04:06:33,860
god, stop.

7039
04:06:35,480 --> 04:06:37,140
Don't be like, don't be him.

7040
04:06:37,580 --> 04:06:38,340
You're not him.

7041
04:06:38,920 --> 04:06:39,840
You're missing.

7042
04:06:41,200 --> 04:06:43,780
Oh, he- Okay, he hit a headshot.

7043
04:06:44,740 --> 04:06:47,560
Alright, you go back to the angle.

7044
04:06:47,900 --> 04:06:48,700
You're not him!

7045
04:06:48,860 --> 04:06:49,540
You're missing!

7046
04:06:49,540 --> 04:06:51,060
He didn't even get a headshot!

7047
04:06:51,960 --> 04:06:53,440
You're fighting a pro player there, my goodness.

7048
04:06:53,440 --> 04:06:55,860
The moment I said that, he knows I have white armor.

7049
04:06:56,080 --> 04:06:58,620
Go back, go back to- Go back over there, Gerard.

7050
04:06:58,860 --> 04:07:01,340
No, no, Gerard!

7051
04:07:01,840 --> 04:07:03,200
Look at this angle.

7052
04:07:04,260 --> 04:07:05,120
Okay, okay, okay.

7053
04:07:06,300 --> 04:07:07,520
Shoot the top.

7054
04:07:07,660 --> 04:07:08,120
Shoot those.

7055
04:07:08,500 --> 04:07:11,180
Not shoot them, but show presence so they don't fly to us.

7056
04:07:14,820 --> 04:07:16,360
Zone might be going towards them.

7057
04:07:16,480 --> 04:07:17,220
I think so.

7058
04:07:17,640 --> 04:07:19,180
Maybe they're flying there too.

7059
04:07:19,180 --> 04:07:21,800
Yeah, I mean, no matter what, we're still in a really good spot.

7060
04:07:22,060 --> 04:07:23,780
We're just walking in our- Yeah.

7061
04:07:24,800 --> 04:07:25,920
I'm getting drilled.

7062
04:07:34,780 --> 04:07:36,200
Oh, bins reset.

7063
04:07:36,840 --> 04:07:38,020
Oh, wait, but...

7064
04:07:39,700 --> 04:07:42,340
So, we might be able to grab some bins later.

7065
04:07:48,590 --> 04:07:49,270
Are you okay?

7066
04:07:49,970 --> 04:07:50,670
I'm okay.

7067
04:07:55,990 --> 04:07:58,030
Are you still with 300 ping?

7068
04:07:59,330 --> 04:07:59,790
Yes.

7069
04:08:00,590 --> 04:08:01,830
Okay, I see someone here.

7070
04:08:01,970 --> 04:08:02,270
They're running.

7071
04:08:02,870 --> 04:08:04,250
Yeah, I'm coming over to help you.

7072
04:08:05,710 --> 04:08:08,530
Okay, they went behind the snow.

7073
04:08:09,050 --> 04:08:09,970
I can't see them anymore.

7074
04:08:10,150 --> 04:08:10,450
Okay.

7075
04:08:11,850 --> 04:08:12,710
I don't have a scope.

7076
04:08:13,470 --> 04:08:14,210
That's fine.

7077
04:08:14,410 --> 04:08:17,050
Let's just poke them so that they won't push us.

7078
04:08:17,590 --> 04:08:18,410
They have red armor.

7079
04:08:18,710 --> 04:08:20,290
Oh my god, they have red.

7080
04:08:21,450 --> 04:08:22,330
They have red.

7081
04:08:22,370 --> 04:08:25,490
If they see us with white, then we're a little fucked.

7082
04:08:25,490 --> 04:08:27,230
Oh, yeah, they're getting shot.

7083
04:08:28,510 --> 04:08:29,970
There is a...

7084
04:08:29,970 --> 04:08:32,610
The team in Epi?

7085
04:08:32,970 --> 04:08:34,690
No, the bins are reset.

7086
04:08:36,270 --> 04:08:36,850
Okay.

7087
04:08:37,230 --> 04:08:39,170
There's loot below us too.

7088
04:08:39,430 --> 04:08:40,470
We have a crafting too.

7089
04:08:42,310 --> 04:08:43,490
Which team has red armor?

7090
04:08:44,210 --> 04:08:45,790
The team to our left right here.

7091
04:08:47,610 --> 04:08:48,470
Over there.

7092
04:08:51,170 --> 04:08:51,990
In Epi?

7093
04:08:53,310 --> 04:08:54,070
There's no...

7094
04:08:57,630 --> 04:08:58,070
Actually...

7095
04:08:58,070 --> 04:08:59,790
There's no team on us here.

7096
04:09:00,530 --> 04:09:01,890
I think there's a team.

7097
04:09:02,310 --> 04:09:03,090
Team on the bins moving.

7098
04:09:04,990 --> 04:09:05,790
They're moving left.

7099
04:09:06,270 --> 04:09:06,630
On your side.

7100
04:09:09,170 --> 04:09:10,470
They're setting up in there.

7101
04:09:10,970 --> 04:09:11,150
Okay.

7102
04:09:12,690 --> 04:09:14,130
I can't do anything about it though.

7103
04:09:14,150 --> 04:09:15,130
They have to move to your side soon.

7104
04:09:15,270 --> 04:09:16,610
We can't overfocus them though.

7105
04:09:18,330 --> 04:09:20,370
Wait, does he have enough walls?

7106
04:09:20,370 --> 04:09:21,270
I don't think he does.

7107
04:09:21,450 --> 04:09:22,190
He's getting shot.

7108
04:09:22,270 --> 04:09:23,610
Wait, you have to look there though.

7109
04:09:24,670 --> 04:09:25,050
Oh, shit.

7110
04:09:25,230 --> 04:09:26,850
You come here, I'll look over there.

7111
04:09:27,330 --> 04:09:29,030
If you can reset that wall, then it'll be fine.

7112
04:09:29,110 --> 04:09:29,810
Just reset that wall.

7113
04:09:31,350 --> 04:09:33,510
And then we can swap position if we need to.

7114
04:09:33,630 --> 04:09:33,810
There.

7115
04:09:34,310 --> 04:09:34,790
Swapped it.

7116
04:09:35,470 --> 04:09:38,070
You guys need to try and get below.

7117
04:09:39,010 --> 04:09:39,410
I know.

7118
04:09:39,630 --> 04:09:40,230
I can't.

7119
04:09:40,410 --> 04:09:43,970
There might be purple armor for these guys.

7120
04:09:44,730 --> 04:09:45,450
I'm 217.

7121
04:09:47,130 --> 04:09:49,090
But no one's letting me poke them.

7122
04:09:49,210 --> 04:09:49,850
And I have no scope.

7123
04:09:50,550 --> 04:09:51,010
God.

7124
04:09:51,530 --> 04:09:53,830
Oh, they got me.

7125
04:09:54,010 --> 04:09:55,710
Oh shit, they know that I'm left.

7126
04:09:55,710 --> 04:09:56,950
We have a crafter by the way.

7127
04:09:57,710 --> 04:09:57,950
Yeah.

7128
04:10:01,370 --> 04:10:02,610
I'm crafting ammo.

7129
04:10:02,890 --> 04:10:03,130
Okay.

7130
04:10:03,350 --> 04:10:05,610
I think they're gonna charge here because they got me.

7131
04:10:06,390 --> 04:10:08,310
They threw in like a star or something.

7132
04:10:09,250 --> 04:10:09,850
Can I look for you?

7133
04:10:09,850 --> 04:10:10,030
Yeah.

7134
04:10:13,820 --> 04:10:14,600
I'm looking.

7135
04:10:15,720 --> 04:10:16,200
Okay.

7136
04:10:16,440 --> 04:10:17,180
I'm going back.

7137
04:10:18,340 --> 04:10:19,180
That's fine.

7138
04:10:20,580 --> 04:10:21,420
There's people fighting.

7139
04:10:21,660 --> 04:10:22,900
I'm 20.

7140
04:10:24,280 --> 04:10:25,280
Bad for me.

7141
04:10:25,460 --> 04:10:27,000
People fighting in FB.

7142
04:10:27,320 --> 04:10:29,500
You can start.

7143
04:10:30,000 --> 04:10:32,520
You can use all of your rampart covers on that direction now.

7144
04:10:37,700 --> 04:10:38,660
Okay, that's...

7145
04:10:38,660 --> 04:10:40,420
I don't have my rampart wall now.

7146
04:10:41,180 --> 04:10:41,580
Okay, here.

7147
04:10:49,420 --> 04:10:51,280
Oh, that's terrible.

7148
04:10:51,480 --> 04:10:52,340
That is horrible.

7149
04:10:53,360 --> 04:10:54,500
What is happening?

7150
04:10:56,320 --> 04:10:57,520
Oh, man.

7151
04:10:58,060 --> 04:11:00,100
Gotta figure out how to get over the other side.

7152
04:11:01,060 --> 04:11:02,660
Yeah, we're fucked.

7153
04:11:03,280 --> 04:11:03,840
No, we're not.

7154
04:11:04,480 --> 04:11:04,900
No, we're not.

7155
04:11:05,340 --> 04:11:06,280
No, we're not.

7156
04:11:06,700 --> 04:11:07,820
No, we're not.

7157
04:11:08,900 --> 04:11:09,520
They're climbing on us.

7158
04:11:10,680 --> 04:11:11,480
Octane, Octane.

7159
04:11:11,620 --> 04:11:12,520
I couldn't.

7160
04:11:14,560 --> 04:11:15,420
Oh, they're purple.

7161
04:11:15,420 --> 04:11:16,640
I'm ulting this.

7162
04:11:16,720 --> 04:11:18,260
They're bubbling up on us.

7163
04:11:25,040 --> 04:11:26,720
We just have to fight this.

7164
04:11:27,020 --> 04:11:27,820
Get rampart covers down.

7165
04:11:30,500 --> 04:11:31,620
Pushing, pushing, pushing.

7166
04:11:32,340 --> 04:11:32,740
I got one.

7167
04:11:33,160 --> 04:11:34,360
Oh, they're so low.

7168
04:11:34,360 --> 04:11:35,260
One down, one down.

7169
04:11:37,260 --> 04:11:38,020
Nice, last guy.

7170
04:11:38,200 --> 04:11:39,480
No, I was so close.

7171
04:11:41,300 --> 04:11:46,960
I think if we didn't have white, Oh, they died.

7172
04:11:53,840 --> 04:11:56,760
I knocked down two only.

7173
04:11:57,120 --> 04:11:59,500
Oh my god, Jeraud.

7174
04:11:59,560 --> 04:12:01,360
Look, you got 338.

7175
04:12:02,900 --> 04:12:04,040
Let's go.

7176
04:12:04,780 --> 04:12:06,280
No kills, but that's alright.

7177
04:12:06,800 --> 04:12:07,880
We got the map.

7178
04:12:09,880 --> 04:12:11,120
Oh my god.

7179
04:12:12,580 --> 04:12:14,480
The fact that we had white armor.

7180
04:12:15,460 --> 04:12:16,940
Yeah, we only had white armor.

7181
04:12:17,680 --> 04:12:20,760
Yeah, that's so unlucky that we had zone on us.

7182
04:12:21,300 --> 04:12:22,840
Yeah, oh man.

7183
04:12:23,960 --> 04:12:25,360
Oh man, I think that is it.

7184
04:12:26,060 --> 04:12:28,560
I think we're going to be playing tomorrow.

7185
04:12:28,860 --> 04:12:31,200
No, no, no, that's just game two.

7186
04:12:31,700 --> 04:12:32,960
Oh yeah, you're right, you're right.

7187
04:12:33,260 --> 04:12:35,620
We have four more games.

7188
04:12:36,240 --> 04:12:38,780
We have four more games.

7189
04:12:39,320 --> 04:12:43,100
We just got very unlucky with the fucking map.

7190
04:12:43,160 --> 04:12:44,080
RNG, RNG.

7191
04:12:44,200 --> 04:12:49,920
I had no scope and white armor so we couldn't do anything with it.

7192
04:12:51,060 --> 04:12:52,040
It's fine, it's fine.

7193
04:12:52,160 --> 04:12:53,220
We can get them next time.

7194
04:12:53,600 --> 04:12:54,860
We were just really unlucky, right?

7195
04:12:55,240 --> 04:12:57,920
We had really bad RNG on that game.

7196
04:12:58,880 --> 04:13:02,020
Yeah, it's like throughout the round we were just whites and blues.

7197
04:13:02,380 --> 04:13:04,320
Every team that pushed just died so that's fine.

7198
04:13:04,420 --> 04:13:05,680
Oh my god, they got an R9?

7199
04:13:05,860 --> 04:13:07,100
Somebody has an R9?

7200
04:13:07,220 --> 04:13:08,460
The fuck is wrong with them?

7201
04:13:09,980 --> 04:13:11,000
It's not fair.

7202
04:13:11,140 --> 04:13:11,980
Where's my R9?

7203
04:13:12,640 --> 04:13:13,540
Is it like the meta?

7204
04:13:13,700 --> 04:13:14,120
The gun?

7205
04:13:14,500 --> 04:13:15,860
No, R9 is my best gun.

7206
04:13:16,140 --> 04:13:16,940
Oh, care package gun.

7207
04:13:17,480 --> 04:13:21,720
Yeah, it's my favorite tracking gun.

7208
04:13:22,960 --> 04:13:24,720
I fucking love the R9, man.

7209
04:13:25,000 --> 04:13:28,860
I wish that R9 was just as strong as it always was.

7210
04:13:30,000 --> 04:13:30,820
If only.

7211
04:13:32,640 --> 04:13:37,260
It is like the controller gun but at the same time it's just so satisfying.

7212
04:13:38,500 --> 04:13:38,940
Peak apex.

7213
04:13:40,480 --> 04:13:43,920
It's just very satisfying to kill people with an R9.

7214
04:13:44,780 --> 04:13:45,740
It feels so good.

7215
04:13:47,680 --> 04:13:49,540
Oh my god, this guy has all the care packages.

7216
04:13:49,860 --> 04:13:51,700
I wonder what it's like to have red armor.

7217
04:13:53,980 --> 04:13:54,520
Damn.

7218
04:13:55,140 --> 04:13:56,260
I wonder what that's like.

7219
04:13:57,060 --> 04:13:58,780
Sounds so nice right now.

7220
04:14:02,880 --> 04:14:04,440
Dude, they're all red.

7221
04:14:04,960 --> 04:14:06,580
We're so broke.

7222
04:14:06,660 --> 04:14:07,980
We were so broke.

7223
04:14:10,100 --> 04:14:11,760
Literally, we couldn't do anything.

7224
04:14:12,100 --> 04:14:14,440
Man, I wish we could just craft armor back again.

7225
04:14:14,980 --> 04:14:16,560
Oh yeah, true.

7226
04:14:17,920 --> 04:14:21,460
Yeah, we had that beacon to craft the armor.

7227
04:14:22,300 --> 04:14:25,760
I don't know if I had a scope I could have farmed for my blue.

7228
04:14:26,400 --> 04:14:29,520
I literally was just single tap carbine.

7229
04:14:29,520 --> 04:14:33,920
I was like 175 from blue.

7230
04:14:34,280 --> 04:14:37,400
I definitely should have given you my triple take as soon as I got blue.

7231
04:14:37,560 --> 04:14:38,420
Oh, that's true.

7232
04:14:40,040 --> 04:14:41,260
I think I could have farmed...

7233
04:14:41,260 --> 04:14:42,320
Oh my god!

7234
04:14:43,500 --> 04:14:45,300
Are you watching the pathfinder?

7235
04:14:48,720 --> 04:14:50,240
Oh my god, someone behind!

7236
04:14:50,540 --> 04:14:53,720
Oh no, is this it?

7237
04:14:53,800 --> 04:14:54,360
Is this it?

7238
04:14:54,520 --> 04:14:54,960
Is this over?

7239
04:14:55,120 --> 04:14:56,300
They had a catalyst.

7240
04:14:56,300 --> 04:14:56,680
Oh!

7241
04:14:56,880 --> 04:14:57,320
Oh!

7242
04:15:00,180 --> 04:15:02,800
Oh, they got the shield regen.

7243
04:15:03,460 --> 04:15:04,820
Yeah, they did shield regen.

7244
04:15:05,060 --> 04:15:06,180
Oh, that's so good.

7245
04:15:07,420 --> 04:15:07,860
Nevermind.

7246
04:15:08,560 --> 04:15:09,320
Bro, this is hell.

7247
04:15:09,440 --> 04:15:11,640
Wait, this is a terrible zone, actually.

7248
04:15:12,140 --> 04:15:13,900
They played on the other side of this wall?

7249
04:15:14,280 --> 04:15:15,540
Yo, yo, yo!

7250
04:15:16,640 --> 04:15:18,620
They have a terrible zone.

7251
04:15:18,780 --> 04:15:19,640
Oh my god.

7252
04:15:20,580 --> 04:15:22,160
Who the fuck is playing Ashe?

7253
04:15:22,240 --> 04:15:23,980
Oh, fuck me.

7254
04:15:23,980 --> 04:15:24,960
Ashe, what the fuck?

7255
04:15:27,920 --> 04:15:28,520
Bro,

7256
04:15:34,780 --> 04:15:36,940
this is where everybody fucking dies.

7257
04:15:37,000 --> 04:15:37,820
There's no way.

7258
04:15:38,900 --> 04:15:41,180
Bro, this guy used his teammate as cover.

7259
04:15:41,720 --> 04:15:42,920
That's so fucked.

7260
04:15:43,200 --> 04:15:46,020
Oh god, they're all sandwiched!

7261
04:15:46,440 --> 04:15:51,100
I literally saw the Ashe just use his teammate as a fucking bullet shield.

7262
04:15:53,980 --> 04:15:56,080
Damn, I was like, damn, poor Gippy.

7263
04:15:56,420 --> 04:15:57,240
That poor man.

7264
04:16:00,840 --> 04:16:02,360
Oh my god.

7265
04:16:02,940 --> 04:16:04,600
He got fucking fed.

7266
04:16:07,360 --> 04:16:08,400
Holy shit.

7267
04:16:09,320 --> 04:16:10,640
Whoever... Oh my god.

7268
04:16:10,760 --> 04:16:13,040
I'm jealous of all the teams who had godspot.

7269
04:16:13,620 --> 04:16:14,960
I'm so jealous.

7270
04:16:16,400 --> 04:16:18,480
Like, it's just good zone prediction.

7271
04:16:20,100 --> 04:16:26,720
We didn't have, like, we didn't have another thing to read zone, so it's just about predicting zones.

7272
04:16:27,660 --> 04:16:30,220
Which is really difficult because there's a million fucking zones.

7273
04:16:30,240 --> 04:16:34,880
If anyone got the zone, the end here of Ring 2, they are like Jesus.

7274
04:16:35,340 --> 04:16:35,920
They're zero.

7275
04:16:36,140 --> 04:16:36,760
They're actually Jesus.

7276
04:16:38,020 --> 04:16:42,440
I had, like, there were a few spots I thought it could have ended, but I'm not here.

7277
04:16:42,660 --> 04:16:42,780
Yeah.

7278
04:16:43,800 --> 04:16:53,900
Because there's, like, the thing is, there's, like, basically thousands of zone combinations that can happen depending on, and, like, it's very hard to predict zones.

7279
04:16:54,820 --> 04:16:55,740
My god.

7280
04:16:55,880 --> 04:16:57,420
You studied that?

7281
04:16:57,500 --> 04:16:58,160
All of you did?

7282
04:16:58,360 --> 04:16:59,120
Well, I don't.

7283
04:16:59,460 --> 04:17:00,300
I play with somebody.

7284
04:17:01,340 --> 04:17:06,780
I thought just scanning, like, the towers would be enough to, like, um... No, you gotta predict where things are.

7285
04:17:07,480 --> 04:17:08,300
Oh, man.

7286
04:17:08,600 --> 04:17:09,060
RNG.

7287
04:17:09,360 --> 04:17:15,780
So, like, especially after, like, some teams don't have the advantage of being able to have zone scanners.

7288
04:17:16,200 --> 04:17:19,100
So, like, they have to figure it out after first scan.

7289
04:17:19,760 --> 04:17:21,420
Oh, do we not have that?

7290
04:17:21,540 --> 04:17:25,860
No, we did have first scan, but, like, we didn't have second scan, so we had to predict it.

7291
04:17:26,600 --> 04:17:28,480
So, yeah, basically have to guess where it is.

7292
04:17:28,940 --> 04:17:35,820
I mean, sometimes, even with, like, third scan, you can you still have to predict, because it can pull, like, somewhere else, though.

7293
04:17:36,040 --> 04:17:36,800
Yeah, it can flip.

7294
04:17:37,080 --> 04:17:37,300
Yeah.

7295
04:17:37,840 --> 04:17:40,120
The thing is, zones can also flip, too.

7296
04:17:40,500 --> 04:17:43,060
So, like, it's just hard.

7297
04:17:44,020 --> 04:17:51,160
It's very, like, if you can predict zones, like, as accurately as you can, then you're, like, fucking Apex Jesus.

7298
04:17:51,640 --> 04:17:57,560
Like, every team would want to have you, because you're literally game-changing.

7299
04:17:57,640 --> 04:17:59,240
You know where it's gonna fucking go.

7300
04:17:59,440 --> 04:18:01,660
Yeah, you can set up real well, too.

7301
04:18:01,820 --> 04:18:03,040
Like, okay, I get it now.

7302
04:18:03,180 --> 04:18:03,280
I get it.

7303
04:18:03,280 --> 04:18:11,760
Any team that figured out end zone basically has the biggest advantage, because they can set up everything and just wait for teams to walk in.

7304
04:18:12,980 --> 04:18:15,500
Bro, so, technically Rattstrat still works?

7305
04:18:16,420 --> 04:18:17,680
Well, not Rattstrat.

7306
04:18:17,840 --> 04:18:21,780
It's literally you show you have presence in one of the best spots possible.

7307
04:18:22,680 --> 04:18:23,380
Oh, okay, okay.

7308
04:18:23,440 --> 04:18:27,200
I thought it's, like, similar to that, where you're like, okay, I'm just gonna wait here, then.

7309
04:18:28,200 --> 04:18:28,800
Stuff like that.

7310
04:18:28,820 --> 04:18:35,580
No, it's more so, like, you have such a good location that teams coming in, you can just farm teams who are coming in.

7311
04:18:36,120 --> 04:18:37,600
Oh, shit, you're right, you're right.

7312
04:18:37,620 --> 04:18:44,680
They don't predict a zone correctly, so you just shoot the teams that are fucking running from the edge, trying to get to you.

7313
04:18:45,640 --> 04:18:47,080
And you just, it's just free shots.

7314
04:18:48,420 --> 04:18:50,100
I will never get this at all.

7315
04:18:51,020 --> 04:18:55,500
Like, you don't, you don't have to That's why I don't, I don't do, I don't learn zones.

7316
04:18:55,580 --> 04:18:58,400
I literally just play with people that know where the fuck zone is.

7317
04:18:58,740 --> 04:19:04,580
Cause I just, like, yeah, I'm just like, you know where the zone is, I'll just, I'll let you decide where to go.

7318
04:19:06,040 --> 04:19:07,060
That's why we have Flame.

7319
04:19:08,740 --> 04:19:09,900
That's why I have Flame here.

7320
04:19:09,900 --> 04:19:11,680
I'm pretty bad in zones as well, man.

7321
04:19:11,900 --> 04:19:13,700
I'm not the one that reads zones on my team.

7322
04:19:13,720 --> 04:19:16,200
Yeah, but like, you have the IG, you can try.

7323
04:19:16,840 --> 04:19:19,360
Yeah, you've played enough experience.

7324
04:19:19,740 --> 04:19:20,440
You can try.

7325
04:19:21,920 --> 04:19:23,840
Better than what I bring.

7326
04:19:27,000 --> 04:19:31,700
All I can do is just be like, Gerard, follow Gerard.

7327
04:19:33,980 --> 04:19:35,600
Go ahead, like, okay.

7328
04:19:35,960 --> 04:19:39,520
I'm just, like, blindly following because I have no idea what the strategies are.

7329
04:19:40,240 --> 04:19:42,220
And surprisingly, it's still held out.

7330
04:19:42,660 --> 04:19:43,760
We're still holding on.

7331
04:19:44,200 --> 04:19:45,080
Yeah, surprisingly,

7332
04:19:49,420 --> 04:19:50,520
we can do it.

7333
04:19:50,640 --> 04:19:57,340
It's just, you know, we just, we can have three games where we fuck up, but the next three we actually gotta do well.

7334
04:19:57,920 --> 04:20:00,380
Yeah, we have to actually land top ten.

7335
04:20:00,560 --> 04:20:01,600
Like, within top ten?

7336
04:20:02,680 --> 04:20:03,020
Nope.

7337
04:20:03,360 --> 04:20:05,000
Or like, top five is the requirement.

7338
04:20:05,540 --> 04:20:06,300
No, it's top ten.

7339
04:20:06,880 --> 04:20:07,520
Top ten.

7340
04:20:07,520 --> 04:20:08,000
Top ten, god.

7341
04:20:08,000 --> 04:20:09,200
Okay.

7342
04:20:09,760 --> 04:20:11,180
You having that bad?

7343
04:20:13,760 --> 04:20:16,120
Are we actually in the last this time?

7344
04:20:17,820 --> 04:20:19,860
Let's not think about that, Gerard.

7345
04:20:20,120 --> 04:20:20,800
Let's...

7346
04:20:22,560 --> 04:20:24,740
Gerard, let's not think about that.

7347
04:20:25,160 --> 04:20:26,640
Alright, alright, alright.

7348
04:20:26,960 --> 04:20:30,560
Let's just think about where we're at now.

7349
04:20:31,960 --> 04:20:35,220
Let's think about our next game.

7350
04:20:36,260 --> 04:20:37,380
Yeah, okay, okay.

7351
04:20:37,440 --> 04:20:38,640
Not knowing is...

7352
04:20:39,140 --> 04:20:42,440
You know, when we get a good game, let's think about it.

7353
04:20:42,540 --> 04:20:45,780
But now, let's just chill.

7354
04:20:46,100 --> 04:20:46,500
Don't look at it.

7355
04:20:46,800 --> 04:20:48,020
Just don't look at it.

7356
04:20:48,780 --> 04:20:50,260
I'm not gonna look at the chat anymore.

7357
04:20:50,400 --> 04:20:51,940
I don't wanna know.

7358
04:20:53,520 --> 04:20:55,700
Just don't look at your chat in three minutes.

7359
04:20:58,780 --> 04:21:00,460
Oh yeah, I forgot about that.

7360
04:21:01,300 --> 04:21:02,640
Don't look at your chat.

7361
04:21:03,240 --> 04:21:04,420
Yeah, okay, alright.

7362
04:21:05,280 --> 04:21:06,160
Jesus Christ.

7363
04:21:06,700 --> 04:21:08,680
Like, from who's... No, I'm not gonna ask.

7364
04:21:08,820 --> 04:21:09,660
I don't even know.

7365
04:21:09,780 --> 04:21:10,680
I don't even wanna know.

7366
04:21:11,080 --> 04:21:13,660
Like, I was about to ask, like, who killed us?

7367
04:21:14,200 --> 04:21:14,900
Who killed us?

7368
04:21:14,940 --> 04:21:15,600
I don't know.

7369
04:21:15,840 --> 04:21:17,220
Actually, I do.

7370
04:21:17,420 --> 04:21:17,960
Let me look.

7371
04:21:18,720 --> 04:21:21,440
It's team 16.

7372
04:21:22,680 --> 04:21:24,080
Is I16 or 15?

7373
04:21:24,080 --> 04:21:25,440
Because they died right after.

7374
04:21:26,540 --> 04:21:28,000
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

7375
04:21:28,320 --> 04:21:29,320
I have no idea who they are.

7376
04:21:29,460 --> 04:21:30,120
Oh wait, I know Yuka.

7377
04:21:30,120 --> 04:21:32,000
Is that Yuka's team?

7378
04:21:32,140 --> 04:21:34,220
Or I don't know who Pog is.

7379
04:21:35,000 --> 04:21:36,820
Oh shit, it's Pog!

7380
04:21:37,500 --> 04:21:37,960
Okay.

7381
04:21:38,860 --> 04:21:40,300
Is that team 15 or 16?

7382
04:21:41,940 --> 04:21:44,940
Wait, apparently someone tried Japanese actors in here.

7383
04:21:45,120 --> 04:21:45,720
Wait, really?

7384
04:21:45,880 --> 04:21:46,340
That's cool.

7385
04:21:46,580 --> 04:21:46,800
Whoa, really?

7386
04:21:47,620 --> 04:21:49,720
I have no idea who it is.

7387
04:21:55,060 --> 04:21:56,340
We got this.

7388
04:21:57,060 --> 04:22:01,740
We just gotta figure out how this lobby Oh, we just gotta figure out how this lobby is like.

7389
04:22:02,000 --> 04:22:03,520
I thought that was, like, storm port for a second.

7390
04:22:03,600 --> 04:22:04,780
But I'm like, no, it says World's Edge.

7391
04:22:05,820 --> 04:22:08,060
I like how it says World's Edge ALGS.

7392
04:22:10,100 --> 04:22:11,760
We're in ALGS, guys!

7393
04:22:12,060 --> 04:22:14,100
Oh, um...

7394
04:22:14,680 --> 04:22:18,300
Uh, wait, maybe he'll get in.

7395
04:22:19,640 --> 04:22:21,660
Wait, so Wait, was I not inside?

7396
04:22:22,440 --> 04:22:23,520
Maybe he'll get in.

7397
04:22:25,860 --> 04:22:26,240
Maybe...

7398
04:22:26,240 --> 04:22:26,980
Maybe?

7399
04:22:28,200 --> 04:22:30,220
Gerard, I don't think you're getting in, Gerard.

7400
04:22:30,560 --> 04:22:31,660
Wait, I will, I will, I will!

7401
04:22:32,040 --> 04:22:32,980
I will!

7402
04:22:35,100 --> 04:22:36,780
I think he's not in.

7403
04:22:37,100 --> 04:22:38,420
I will, I will, I will.

7404
04:22:38,540 --> 04:22:39,240
You just have to believe.

7405
04:22:39,500 --> 04:22:41,860
No, it just says two people.

7406
04:22:42,680 --> 04:22:43,780
Alright, Flame, it's your turn.

7407
04:22:44,040 --> 04:22:45,100
I did last time.

7408
04:22:46,700 --> 04:22:47,000
No.

7409
04:22:47,060 --> 04:22:47,440
No!

7410
04:22:49,440 --> 04:22:49,840
Ping!

7411
04:22:51,640 --> 04:22:53,120
Gerard, you should tell them.

7412
04:22:53,720 --> 04:22:54,580
We did it.

7413
04:22:55,100 --> 04:22:56,440
Okay, where, where, where?

7414
04:22:57,300 --> 04:22:58,260
I've already told them.

7415
04:22:58,980 --> 04:23:00,060
I've already told them.

7416
04:23:01,360 --> 04:23:02,940
Okay, where, where do I say it?

7417
04:23:03,820 --> 04:23:04,880
It's okay, it's okay.

7418
04:23:04,880 --> 04:23:05,140
It's all good.

7419
04:23:08,620 --> 04:23:09,420
In progress.

7420
04:23:09,580 --> 04:23:10,100
Okay, I'm in here.

7421
04:23:10,620 --> 04:23:10,940
Error!

7422
04:23:11,160 --> 04:23:11,740
Unable to connect.

7423
04:23:11,900 --> 04:23:12,200
Code view.

7424
04:23:13,740 --> 04:23:14,140
What?!

7425
04:23:14,140 --> 04:23:16,140
It disconnected me from the game!

7426
04:23:17,240 --> 04:23:19,220
Korean joined back because they don't know who it is.

7427
04:23:27,000 --> 04:23:28,900
I'm in here, I'm in here, I'm in here.

7428
04:23:29,040 --> 04:23:30,600
I'm in here, I'm in here.

7429
04:23:30,600 --> 04:23:33,600
So they don't know, they don't know who it, who's fault it is.

7430
04:23:33,700 --> 04:23:34,400
They don't know.

7431
04:23:36,500 --> 04:23:38,360
I hope they don't look at my POV!

7432
04:23:39,080 --> 04:23:39,440
God!

7433
04:23:40,860 --> 04:23:42,120
No, no one's gonna look at my POV.

7434
04:23:42,460 --> 04:23:43,660
Nobody knows!

7435
04:23:44,020 --> 04:23:44,780
No one knows.

7436
04:23:44,860 --> 04:23:46,360
They're like, why did they restart?

7437
04:23:46,780 --> 04:23:47,680
We'll never know.

7438
04:23:47,840 --> 04:23:48,920
I'm gonna get a cough job.

7439
04:23:49,020 --> 04:23:49,200
I'm gonna get a cough job.

7440
04:23:49,200 --> 04:23:52,180
90 % of the restarts are because of me.

7441
04:23:52,240 --> 04:23:53,680
I don't know why to think about that.

7442
04:23:54,480 --> 04:23:55,660
God, please don't.

7443
04:23:55,720 --> 04:23:58,160
Please at least have one more person who's like, disconnecting.

7444
04:23:58,600 --> 04:23:58,860
Please.

7445
04:24:00,320 --> 04:24:01,640
Oh, I think it's just me, isn't it?

7446
04:24:05,040 --> 04:24:07,800
Uh-oh, are you guys like, actually playing now?

7447
04:24:12,090 --> 04:24:13,550
Oh, what the fuck?!

7448
04:24:14,870 --> 04:24:15,230
Hey!

7449
04:24:15,230 --> 04:24:16,030
Talk to me!

7450
04:24:16,990 --> 04:24:17,050
What's going on?

7451
04:24:18,070 --> 04:24:18,430
Jesus!

7452
04:24:18,670 --> 04:24:19,130
What's going on?

7453
04:24:19,210 --> 04:24:21,650
You guys are like, giving me the sound treatment!

7454
04:24:21,650 --> 04:24:23,550
Oh, my bad, man.

7455
04:24:23,650 --> 04:24:24,850
I'm like, hey, what?

7456
04:24:25,190 --> 04:24:25,430
Hello?

7457
04:24:25,670 --> 04:24:25,910
See?

7458
04:24:26,510 --> 04:24:28,490
Suddenly the bullying happens now?

7459
04:24:28,870 --> 04:24:30,730
Oh, wait, what?

7460
04:24:30,910 --> 04:24:33,570
Oh, Flame, are you gonna...

7461
04:24:33,570 --> 04:24:34,310
What?

7462
04:24:35,570 --> 04:24:37,350
What do you mean, bullying happens now?

7463
04:24:37,370 --> 04:24:38,150
Is he doing it?

7464
04:24:39,730 --> 04:24:40,210
What?

7465
04:24:40,770 --> 04:24:42,110
For a hot second.

7466
04:24:42,470 --> 04:24:42,850
New code.

7467
04:24:42,970 --> 04:24:43,690
Oh, shit, new code.

7468
04:24:43,790 --> 04:24:44,430
Oh, new code?

7469
04:24:44,530 --> 04:24:45,370
Oh, okay.

7470
04:24:47,410 --> 04:24:47,890
Nice.

7471
04:24:48,730 --> 04:24:49,250
Nice.

7472
04:24:50,690 --> 04:24:51,670
They don't know.

7473
04:24:52,190 --> 04:24:52,990
They don't know.

7474
04:24:53,030 --> 04:24:53,790
Great, great, great.

7475
04:24:55,990 --> 04:24:59,670
Oh, is it in group A, the code?

7476
04:25:00,310 --> 04:25:02,210
No, it's gonna be in announce winners.

7477
04:25:04,790 --> 04:25:07,050
I like how all you wrote was D.C.

7478
04:25:09,690 --> 04:25:12,950
Yeah, that's how it usually goes.

7479
04:25:13,610 --> 04:25:14,270
D.C.

7480
04:25:15,010 --> 04:25:16,670
That's usually all you have to write.

7481
04:25:17,770 --> 04:25:18,990
LGS and scrims.

7482
04:25:19,150 --> 04:25:22,210
You're giving them the real scrim experience.

7483
04:25:23,130 --> 04:25:24,810
All right, code is out, Gerard.

7484
04:25:25,070 --> 04:25:26,330
Okay, all right, all right, got it.

7485
04:25:26,750 --> 04:25:27,910
It's in announce winners.

7486
04:25:28,610 --> 04:25:29,650
Yeah, I'm here.

7487
04:25:31,070 --> 04:25:31,590
Good.

7488
04:25:31,910 --> 04:25:33,070
I believe in us.

7489
04:25:33,830 --> 04:25:38,390
At least not last in terms of getting into the lobby.

7490
04:25:40,010 --> 04:25:40,850
Improvement, improvement.

7491
04:25:40,970 --> 04:25:41,710
Okay, I can feel it now.

7492
04:25:42,470 --> 04:25:43,530
I can feel it.

7493
04:25:44,210 --> 04:25:45,170
There's it, there's it.

7494
04:25:45,530 --> 04:25:46,190
Not last.

7495
04:25:46,710 --> 04:25:47,050
First.

7496
04:25:47,550 --> 04:25:54,570
We never got 20 in place, so I feel like at that point, you know, it's pretty good that we never got 20 in.

7497
04:25:55,590 --> 04:25:57,730
Yeah, at least we weren't really down first.

7498
04:25:57,830 --> 04:25:58,170
Oh, God.

7499
04:25:58,430 --> 04:25:59,190
Thank God.

7500
04:25:59,510 --> 04:26:01,130
It's the little things in life.

7501
04:26:01,890 --> 04:26:03,330
Are you guys excited to play more tomorrow?

7502
04:26:04,590 --> 04:26:05,830
Are you guys excited to play more?

7503
04:26:08,770 --> 04:26:11,890
Oh, what time is it?

7504
04:26:11,890 --> 04:26:12,890
Same time, really?

7505
04:26:14,330 --> 04:26:15,770
Let me actually double check.

7506
04:26:16,250 --> 04:26:18,690
In case, you know, the worst that could happen.

7507
04:26:18,870 --> 04:26:21,470
You know, the worst that could happen if we play tomorrow.

7508
04:26:22,270 --> 04:26:23,010
Oh, wait, no.

7509
04:26:23,230 --> 04:26:24,110
Wait, is it not?

7510
04:26:24,490 --> 04:26:25,330
Wait, I don't think it's the same.

7511
04:26:25,490 --> 04:26:27,110
No, that's the scrim block.

7512
04:26:28,790 --> 04:26:30,010
That's the scrim block.

7513
04:26:30,370 --> 04:26:31,210
Jesus Christ.

7514
04:26:31,590 --> 04:26:33,090
Look, it's all in Japanese.

7515
04:26:33,090 --> 04:26:33,970
I'm doing my best.

7516
04:26:34,070 --> 04:26:34,730
It's all in Japanese.

7517
04:26:34,950 --> 04:26:36,450
I'm looking through stuff right now.

7518
04:26:37,730 --> 04:26:38,550
You can do it.

7519
04:26:38,550 --> 04:26:43,270
I'm trying to figure out where the time is for a day for this.

7520
04:26:43,470 --> 04:26:43,710
Okay.

7521
04:26:44,250 --> 04:26:46,450
Is this day one or day two?

7522
04:26:47,410 --> 04:26:48,810
No, that's day one.

7523
04:26:50,310 --> 04:26:51,350
And then...

7524
04:26:51,350 --> 04:26:52,650
Where's day...

7525
04:26:52,650 --> 04:26:54,390
Where the fuck is...

7526
04:26:54,390 --> 04:26:56,470
Where the fuck is the schedule?

7527
04:26:57,290 --> 04:26:58,870
Okay, I can do this, guys.

7528
04:26:59,130 --> 04:27:00,890
Okay, POI, round robin.

7529
04:27:00,970 --> 04:27:02,110
That's winner's match.

7530
04:27:02,850 --> 04:27:05,150
Guys, I'm having trouble trying to find the schedule.

7531
04:27:05,830 --> 04:27:08,810
I'm having a little bit of a trouble.

7532
04:27:09,310 --> 04:27:10,310
I'll just ask them.

7533
04:27:10,910 --> 04:27:15,510
I'll be like... I'll preemptively ask them what time is day two.

7534
04:27:15,590 --> 04:27:16,890
Oh, matchmaking, matchmaking.

7535
04:27:17,130 --> 04:27:17,530
That's fine.

7536
04:27:17,590 --> 04:27:18,470
We still have to pick characters.

7537
04:27:19,410 --> 04:27:20,030
Okay, okay, alright.

7538
04:27:21,790 --> 04:27:25,030
Wow, you really wanted to hear her stop talking that much, Gerard?

7539
04:27:25,430 --> 04:27:26,850
Wow, he doesn't want to know.

7540
04:27:26,970 --> 04:27:29,130
He doesn't want to know what day two is.

7541
04:27:29,130 --> 04:27:31,490
If they tap out, like audio sometimes cut off.

7542
04:27:31,570 --> 04:27:32,130
I'm just saying.

7543
04:27:32,130 --> 04:27:35,630
Wow, you really didn't want to know what day two was.

7544
04:27:35,950 --> 04:27:37,150
No, I wanted to know!

7545
04:27:37,350 --> 04:27:40,030
I'm just letting you know.

7546
04:27:40,210 --> 04:27:40,970
I'm a great friend.

7547
04:27:41,130 --> 04:27:43,250
I let people know when things are happening.

7548
04:27:44,410 --> 04:27:47,810
You know he's a great friend when he says, I'm a great friend.

7549
04:27:49,110 --> 04:27:51,490
Why are you trying to convince me, or you?

7550
04:27:51,650 --> 04:27:52,930
I am a great friend.

7551
04:27:53,570 --> 04:27:55,990
Like to all of you, I'm a great friend.

7552
04:27:56,190 --> 04:27:59,510
I listen to your problems and I provide you with information.

7553
04:28:00,890 --> 04:28:03,150
He did listen to your problems.

7554
04:28:04,150 --> 04:28:04,230
He did.

7555
04:28:05,870 --> 04:28:07,690
Like I'm just instigating, man.

7556
04:28:09,130 --> 04:28:12,110
As long as he doesn't spawn and siphon, we're fine.

7557
04:28:13,790 --> 04:28:15,490
You're still thinking about that?

7558
04:28:15,710 --> 04:28:16,770
That was crazy.

7559
04:28:17,390 --> 04:28:18,790
I didn't choose that.

7560
04:28:18,930 --> 04:28:20,090
It just happened.

7561
04:28:21,530 --> 04:28:24,230
Yeah, I was actually I've never seen that before.

7562
04:28:24,650 --> 04:28:26,030
I didn't make it to the center.

7563
04:28:26,550 --> 04:28:28,090
That was a one time thing.

7564
04:28:28,150 --> 04:28:29,070
It will never happen again.

7565
04:28:29,070 --> 04:28:30,110
Sure.

7566
04:28:32,870 --> 04:28:34,110
It won't.

7567
04:28:34,630 --> 04:28:35,150
It won't.

7568
04:28:37,430 --> 04:28:39,390
I totally believe in you.

7569
04:28:39,970 --> 04:28:43,170
You've been saying that but you don't.

7570
04:28:43,730 --> 04:28:46,610
Hey, purple our helmet.

7571
04:28:47,850 --> 04:28:48,810
Alright.

7572
04:28:52,310 --> 04:28:59,050
I'll grab the helmet.

7573
04:29:00,730 --> 04:29:03,250
There's one more bin over here.

7574
04:29:03,370 --> 04:29:06,090
There's a nemesis here but I'm not gonna.

7575
04:29:06,570 --> 04:29:10,770
If you see a repeater let me know because I'll try to run a repeater this time.

7576
04:29:12,290 --> 04:29:13,330
Just ammo.

7577
04:29:13,470 --> 04:29:14,090
Oh wait, nevermind.

7578
04:29:14,350 --> 04:29:14,950
There's a carbine.

7579
04:29:15,190 --> 04:29:15,510
JK

7580
04:29:20,850 --> 04:29:21,890
There's a repeater.

7581
04:29:22,970 --> 04:29:24,150
Okay, I'll run a repeater.

7582
04:29:25,150 --> 04:29:28,730
We're going through a fragment into geyser here.

7583
04:29:31,310 --> 04:29:33,050
Yeah, we want that cache on the right.

7584
04:29:33,450 --> 04:29:35,270
There's a carbine here if anybody wants it.

7585
04:29:36,190 --> 04:29:36,630
I'm okay.

7586
04:29:37,510 --> 04:29:38,470
I'm running repeater.

7587
04:29:38,850 --> 04:29:44,610
We have to be careful of survey camp but we'll hit that cache and then go into frag and then go into geyser.

7588
04:29:45,310 --> 04:29:46,890
Alright, I'm ready to go whenever.

7589
04:29:47,890 --> 04:29:48,790
Yeah, we can start going.

7590
04:29:51,470 --> 04:29:54,570
Careful with the cache there's a good chance geyser's gonna be there.

7591
04:29:54,570 --> 04:29:56,590
Someone needs to hit this bin.

7592
04:29:57,650 --> 04:29:58,710
I'll go for it.

7593
04:30:00,170 --> 04:30:01,310
Gerard, come towards me.

7594
04:30:03,150 --> 04:30:05,570
We need to look for this cache.

7595
04:30:06,390 --> 04:30:08,650
There's a good chance survey is going for it as well.

7596
04:30:09,210 --> 04:30:10,430
We have to be careful.

7597
04:30:12,690 --> 04:30:13,730
Do you need a 3x?

7598
04:30:14,990 --> 04:30:15,810
I have one, I'm okay.

7599
04:30:16,030 --> 04:30:17,090
Okay, I'll grab it.

7600
04:30:21,190 --> 04:30:22,610
I'm just running straight for the cache.

7601
04:30:22,610 --> 04:30:23,790
Go run back, Gerard.

7602
04:30:24,650 --> 04:30:25,330
Where do you want me to go?

7603
04:30:26,630 --> 04:30:28,630
Up towards the hill, we're just going into geyser.

7604
04:30:28,970 --> 04:30:29,950
Into fragment first.

7605
04:30:30,770 --> 04:30:31,370
I'm here.

7606
04:30:33,810 --> 04:30:34,670
I'll wait for you.

7607
04:30:35,670 --> 04:30:36,990
Do you want me to take the zip or just walk?

7608
04:30:39,250 --> 04:30:40,850
No, we can just go.

7609
04:30:41,170 --> 04:30:43,890
Anyway, it's fine.

7610
04:30:46,470 --> 04:30:48,670
Is your team in your room right now?

7611
04:30:48,670 --> 04:30:54,010
No, that's my brother and his friend.

7612
04:30:54,630 --> 04:30:56,790
He's watching you play?

7613
04:30:59,320 --> 04:31:01,320
No, they're just vibing behind me.

7614
04:31:01,520 --> 04:31:03,160
He's just vibing.

7615
04:31:05,900 --> 04:31:08,660
Gerard is very far, so...

7616
04:31:08,660 --> 04:31:10,220
Let me know if it gets like...

7617
04:31:11,120 --> 04:31:12,720
If they get too loud.

7618
04:31:13,120 --> 04:31:13,780
Yeah, no problem.

7619
04:31:16,560 --> 04:31:18,120
It's fine, it's fine.

7620
04:31:18,120 --> 04:31:19,160
Everything's fine.

7621
04:31:21,880 --> 04:31:23,520
It's okay, we have blue armor.

7622
04:31:23,980 --> 04:31:24,920
Things are different.

7623
04:31:29,300 --> 04:31:32,920
Someone's just flown up towards this truck.

7624
04:31:33,040 --> 04:31:33,940
Just come left with me.

7625
04:31:34,360 --> 04:31:35,200
There's a blue armor here.

7626
04:31:35,260 --> 04:31:36,000
There's a blue backpack.

7627
04:31:36,460 --> 04:31:37,800
I'm hearing a lot of fighting.

7628
04:31:39,460 --> 04:31:40,220
Can you guys come to me?

7629
04:31:40,420 --> 04:31:41,560
Yeah, I'm literally right behind you.

7630
04:31:41,700 --> 04:31:43,020
They're running kind of towards us here.

7631
04:31:43,540 --> 04:31:45,660
Wait, zone might be...

7632
04:31:45,660 --> 04:31:46,560
Yeah, zone's here, I think.

7633
04:31:46,640 --> 04:31:46,940
Zone's here.

7634
04:31:48,940 --> 04:31:51,320
Oh my god, I fucked up my climb.

7635
04:31:51,720 --> 04:31:53,180
Zone's like 100% here.

7636
04:31:53,300 --> 04:31:54,320
He's just playing on me.

7637
04:31:55,160 --> 04:31:56,000
He could be dying here.

7638
04:31:58,660 --> 04:31:59,560
Start putting walls.

7639
04:31:59,860 --> 04:32:00,340
Start putting walls.

7640
04:32:00,980 --> 04:32:02,180
There's a new castle up here.

7641
04:32:02,340 --> 04:32:03,860
There's a team playing under the bridge here.

7642
04:32:04,080 --> 04:32:04,400
Hit 50.

7643
04:32:04,700 --> 04:32:05,880
I need a wall back here too.

7644
04:32:07,940 --> 04:32:08,920
They're fighting at the house.

7645
04:32:09,560 --> 04:32:10,080
Put a wall behind.

7646
04:32:10,720 --> 04:32:11,800
That's a 3v1 already.

7647
04:32:11,800 --> 04:32:12,060
Behind.

7648
04:32:14,900 --> 04:32:15,940
I'm looking here.

7649
04:32:16,300 --> 04:32:17,060
Wait, I'm getting shot at.

7650
04:32:18,740 --> 04:32:19,500
Behind, behind.

7651
04:32:19,600 --> 04:32:21,960
I need a wall behind right here.

7652
04:32:22,360 --> 04:32:22,440
Where?

7653
04:32:22,760 --> 04:32:23,440
Okay, okay, okay.

7654
04:32:24,560 --> 04:32:26,000
I'm gonna place a wall down.

7655
04:32:26,160 --> 04:32:26,540
Wait, wait, wait.

7656
04:32:26,600 --> 04:32:27,020
Take that away.

7657
04:32:27,160 --> 04:32:27,480
Take that away.

7658
04:32:28,400 --> 04:32:28,800
Okay.

7659
04:32:29,540 --> 04:32:29,880
Got it.

7660
04:32:31,800 --> 04:32:33,680
That's a pretty ugly wall, I can't lie.

7661
04:32:35,920 --> 04:32:37,220
How many respawn?

7662
04:32:39,780 --> 04:32:43,100
Get a wall down like over here when you have it.

7663
04:32:43,260 --> 04:32:44,060
Look, look, look.

7664
04:32:44,300 --> 04:32:45,200
In the open.

7665
04:32:46,180 --> 04:32:46,940
Oh, no.

7666
04:32:48,260 --> 04:32:49,420
He heard me.

7667
04:32:51,120 --> 04:32:52,060
Oh, that rampart's flush.

7668
04:32:52,700 --> 04:32:53,520
This team can die.

7669
04:32:54,300 --> 04:32:55,520
Focus rampart.

7670
04:32:57,200 --> 04:32:58,500
Which one's rampart?

7671
04:32:59,060 --> 04:32:59,260
Behind.

7672
04:33:00,000 --> 04:33:00,780
Oh, I suck.

7673
04:33:01,280 --> 04:33:02,060
Wait, wait, wait.

7674
04:33:04,360 --> 04:33:05,780
Gibby on the right here as well.

7675
04:33:06,220 --> 04:33:06,500
New castle.

7676
04:33:06,800 --> 04:33:07,100
Shoot this.

7677
04:33:07,540 --> 04:33:07,800
On the right.

7678
04:33:08,360 --> 04:33:08,600
60.

7679
04:33:08,720 --> 04:33:09,120
I know.

7680
04:33:12,840 --> 04:33:14,160
Oh my god, they're so far.

7681
04:33:18,710 --> 04:33:19,510
60 on Gibby.

7682
04:33:19,950 --> 04:33:20,670
28 on one.

7683
04:33:21,470 --> 04:33:23,370
I'm gonna look behind us just in case.

7684
04:33:23,690 --> 04:33:25,130
Can you look at the back?

7685
04:33:25,390 --> 04:33:26,230
You look back.

7686
04:33:26,370 --> 04:33:28,250
Look behind and make sure nobody walks up.

7687
04:33:28,590 --> 04:33:29,390
So we can farm this.

7688
04:33:30,530 --> 04:33:31,110
Right here.

7689
04:33:31,270 --> 04:33:31,750
New castle.

7690
04:33:32,090 --> 04:33:32,290
60.

7691
04:33:33,130 --> 04:33:33,410
100.

7692
04:33:34,770 --> 04:33:35,210
Re-walled.

7693
04:33:35,290 --> 04:33:35,910
I couldn't hit him.

7694
04:33:36,210 --> 04:33:37,290
Yeah, nothing we can do.

7695
04:33:38,110 --> 04:33:39,630
We're getting shot from...

7696
04:33:39,630 --> 04:33:41,170
Oh, that's really bad.

7697
04:33:41,310 --> 04:33:43,290
Careful, careful, careful.

7698
04:33:43,370 --> 04:33:43,910
Oh, fuck.

7699
04:33:45,650 --> 04:33:46,750
I don't think I can look.

7700
04:33:47,390 --> 04:33:51,190
If we start getting naded or we have nowhere safe, just bubble, okay?

7701
04:33:52,390 --> 04:33:56,110
We might need you to re-wall this if you can get a shot from different angles.

7702
04:33:56,130 --> 04:33:57,050
Just play on me.

7703
04:33:57,050 --> 04:33:58,890
Right on me.

7704
04:33:59,050 --> 04:33:59,530
Yeah.

7705
04:34:01,030 --> 04:34:03,370
We need you to re-wall this if you can.

7706
04:34:04,490 --> 04:34:05,450
Yeah, just...

7707
04:34:05,450 --> 04:34:07,030
Here, I'll give you a shield here.

7708
04:34:11,000 --> 04:34:12,040
They're over here.

7709
04:34:12,980 --> 04:34:14,960
Okay, I'm gonna...

7710
04:34:14,960 --> 04:34:15,900
Should I deploy another shield?

7711
04:34:15,960 --> 04:34:17,420
Yeah, it's blocked.

7712
04:34:17,880 --> 04:34:19,300
So just put another one here.

7713
04:34:27,310 --> 04:34:28,270
You're gonna crack this one?

7714
04:34:28,550 --> 04:34:29,130
You're gonna crack it?

7715
04:34:29,730 --> 04:34:30,890
You gotta re-wall this.

7716
04:34:35,270 --> 04:34:36,050
Oh, shit.

7717
04:34:36,370 --> 04:34:37,150
Oh, fuck.

7718
04:34:37,290 --> 04:34:39,110
Yeah, that's pretty rough, that one.

7719
04:34:40,670 --> 04:34:42,350
Whenever you're ready, just re-wall it.

7720
04:34:44,790 --> 04:34:45,030
Okay.

7721
04:34:48,400 --> 04:34:49,840
There's, like, nothing we can do.

7722
04:34:50,860 --> 04:34:52,000
Shit, they're breaking it.

7723
04:34:52,580 --> 04:34:53,420
Yeah, just do it on cooldown.

7724
04:34:53,980 --> 04:34:56,220
They're wasting their stuff.

7725
04:34:57,260 --> 04:34:57,900
Okay, okay, okay.

7726
04:35:00,360 --> 04:35:01,160
Okay, two seconds.

7727
04:35:02,160 --> 04:35:04,080
This one's more important.

7728
04:35:04,080 --> 04:35:05,480
Look, look, in the open, castle!

7729
04:35:06,180 --> 04:35:06,980
Running back.

7730
04:35:07,980 --> 04:35:09,660
There's people on the bridge.

7731
04:35:10,840 --> 04:35:11,040
Yeah.

7732
04:35:12,040 --> 04:35:13,520
When's your next thing?

7733
04:35:13,660 --> 04:35:14,600
Uh, ten seconds.

7734
04:35:15,800 --> 04:35:16,080
Okay.

7735
04:35:16,940 --> 04:35:18,740
Just put it down on my wall.

7736
04:35:19,320 --> 04:35:22,000
Okay, three seconds, two, one.

7737
04:35:23,100 --> 04:35:24,340
Oh, I'm getting shot in the back.

7738
04:35:25,220 --> 04:35:25,900
What's our heals?

7739
04:35:26,200 --> 04:35:26,880
I'm 1-5.

7740
04:35:27,120 --> 04:35:28,720
I'm 4.

7741
04:35:29,420 --> 04:35:31,400
I have a lot of bats, though.

7742
04:35:32,020 --> 04:35:32,880
I have three bats.

7743
04:35:34,920 --> 04:35:35,940
Can you say that again?

7744
04:35:36,320 --> 04:35:37,560
I have three bats, four shield cells.

7745
04:35:37,960 --> 04:35:38,220
Three, four.

7746
04:35:39,340 --> 04:35:40,160
What do you have?

7747
04:35:41,380 --> 04:35:42,040
Uh, druid.

7748
04:35:42,320 --> 04:35:43,160
What's your shield cells?

7749
04:35:44,480 --> 04:35:45,640
Shield cells, you want it?

7750
04:35:46,060 --> 04:35:47,520
No, just how many, how many.

7751
04:35:49,780 --> 04:35:51,380
Just one, just that.

7752
04:35:51,680 --> 04:35:52,400
That's your only heal?

7753
04:35:52,420 --> 04:35:53,280
Yeah, yeah, just keep it.

7754
04:35:54,020 --> 04:35:55,700
My heal is two, here.

7755
04:35:55,820 --> 04:35:56,740
You want a full medkit?

7756
04:35:56,840 --> 04:35:57,000
Here.

7757
04:35:57,400 --> 04:35:58,020
No, no, no.

7758
04:35:58,020 --> 04:35:59,640
Shields, what's your shields?

7759
04:36:00,380 --> 04:36:01,140
Cells and bats.

7760
04:36:02,260 --> 04:36:03,360
Uh, I don't have any more.

7761
04:36:03,620 --> 04:36:04,280
I just gave it.

7762
04:36:04,500 --> 04:36:05,800
Jesus, do you have no heals at all?

7763
04:36:06,720 --> 04:36:07,800
Uh, I have one.

7764
04:36:07,980 --> 04:36:09,700
I have two syringes.

7765
04:36:10,940 --> 04:36:11,740
Okay, okay.

7766
04:36:12,360 --> 04:36:13,320
We'll feed you one.

7767
04:36:13,680 --> 04:36:15,740
No, no, just feed it to him when he needs it.

7768
04:36:16,180 --> 04:36:16,760
Just in case.

7769
04:36:16,960 --> 04:36:17,820
Just don't peek.

7770
04:36:18,020 --> 04:36:19,680
Take it, take it, take it.

7771
04:36:20,940 --> 04:36:22,100
Just don't peek at all.

7772
04:36:22,540 --> 04:36:23,820
Just calm, calm.

7773
04:36:24,300 --> 04:36:26,440
This is a hard lobby, holy shit.

7774
04:36:28,020 --> 04:36:29,980
Keep trying, keep trying to get walls down.

7775
04:36:30,320 --> 04:36:31,800
Yeah, yeah, we need walls here.

7776
04:36:32,120 --> 04:36:33,880
I think we just ignore this west team, guys.

7777
04:36:34,520 --> 04:36:35,940
Pretty much don't try and peek them.

7778
04:36:37,940 --> 04:36:39,400
Can you get a wall down on main road?

7779
04:36:43,390 --> 04:36:44,610
Go to flame.

7780
04:36:44,830 --> 04:36:46,370
We need a wall next to him.

7781
04:36:47,610 --> 04:36:49,010
Just on this wall here.

7782
04:36:49,990 --> 04:36:50,570
Okay, okay, okay.

7783
04:36:50,750 --> 04:36:51,210
Alright, alright.

7784
04:36:51,950 --> 04:36:52,450
Like that.

7785
04:36:54,710 --> 04:36:55,110
Here.

7786
04:36:58,110 --> 04:36:58,510
Here.

7787
04:36:58,510 --> 04:36:58,670
Thank you.

7788
04:37:04,860 --> 04:37:08,720
I don't want to poke too much because I know they're going to destroy my wall if I look at them.

7789
04:37:10,620 --> 04:37:13,520
So I'm just going to wait until I get an actual good shot.

7790
04:37:14,660 --> 04:37:17,140
There's like a team right here that's looking to move.

7791
04:37:17,400 --> 04:37:17,840
Are they fighting?

7792
04:37:18,220 --> 04:37:19,380
No, they're just shooting each other.

7793
04:37:20,740 --> 04:37:21,720
They're just shooting and poking.

7794
04:37:23,080 --> 04:37:26,540
This team wants to move, but I don't know where they're going to move.

7795
04:37:26,580 --> 04:37:27,420
They don't have walls or anything.

7796
04:37:28,820 --> 04:37:30,400
They're under the bridge here.

7797
04:37:36,120 --> 04:37:37,100
Oh, right here.

7798
04:37:39,580 --> 04:37:40,800
They're over here now.

7799
04:37:42,320 --> 04:37:42,940
They're running.

7800
04:37:45,020 --> 04:37:46,740
They're like over here on the side.

7801
04:37:47,760 --> 04:37:49,380
They're peeking there.

7802
04:37:54,930 --> 04:37:55,810
Castle here on the right.

7803
04:37:56,170 --> 04:37:58,110
This guy is like walking back and forth.

7804
04:38:18,730 --> 04:38:20,690
Oh my god, everybody is so...

7805
04:38:20,690 --> 04:38:21,010
Oh.

7806
04:38:24,230 --> 04:38:28,590
If the zone pulls towards ghost out here, we want to just take this.

7807
04:38:30,430 --> 04:38:31,830
I'll just follow you whenever.

7808
04:38:32,910 --> 04:38:33,570
They're poking.

7809
04:38:34,130 --> 04:38:35,650
Nevermind, there's a team in there.

7810
04:38:38,410 --> 04:38:39,470
I don't know if it's just the Rampart.

7811
04:38:39,810 --> 04:38:43,270
Can you come to me and just use Sheila on that?

7812
04:38:44,670 --> 04:38:45,110
Sheila?

7813
04:38:46,450 --> 04:38:47,230
On that door.

7814
04:38:47,230 --> 04:38:48,390
I don't want to break the door.

7815
04:38:48,430 --> 04:38:49,110
Just break the door.

7816
04:38:50,310 --> 04:38:51,110
Just shoot it.

7817
04:38:53,070 --> 04:38:55,310
Hold it out and then shoot it with your ulti.

7818
04:38:57,590 --> 04:38:58,170
No, no, no.

7819
04:38:58,190 --> 04:38:58,510
Uncrouch.

7820
04:38:58,630 --> 04:38:59,730
Shoot this door here.

7821
04:39:06,860 --> 04:39:07,180
Nice.

7822
04:39:07,340 --> 04:39:08,020
Okay, that's it.

7823
04:39:08,340 --> 04:39:08,680
You can go.

7824
04:39:10,180 --> 04:39:11,220
You don't have to keep shooting.

7825
04:39:11,980 --> 04:39:13,220
I think it's a solo Rampart in there.

7826
04:39:14,700 --> 04:39:15,440
Should we rush it?

7827
04:39:15,500 --> 04:39:16,180
Should I give you a shield?

7828
04:39:17,200 --> 04:39:17,840
Yeah, yeah.

7829
04:39:17,880 --> 04:39:18,760
Put a cover down here.

7830
04:39:20,960 --> 04:39:23,860
Yeah, I'm like fairly confident that's a solo Rampart.

7831
04:39:25,660 --> 04:39:28,620
This zone pulled pretty bad for us.

7832
04:39:38,950 --> 04:39:42,050
633 to purple and this team has purple already.

7833
04:39:42,130 --> 04:39:43,110
These fuckers.

7834
04:39:45,290 --> 04:39:46,390
They're fighting on the other house.

7835
04:39:46,490 --> 04:39:47,810
We might want to just walk up on this.

7836
04:39:47,910 --> 04:39:49,310
I'm willing to walk up whenever.

7837
04:39:50,290 --> 04:39:50,590
Yeah, yeah.

7838
04:39:50,690 --> 04:39:51,510
Can you guys come to me?

7839
04:39:51,510 --> 04:39:51,850
Come to me.

7840
04:39:53,710 --> 04:39:54,370
We're just walking.

7841
04:39:54,610 --> 04:39:54,910
Come with me.

7842
04:39:55,730 --> 04:39:56,810
Go to this left row.

7843
04:39:58,990 --> 04:39:59,750
Okay, don't slide now.

7844
04:39:59,830 --> 04:40:00,090
Don't slide.

7845
04:40:00,230 --> 04:40:00,430
Don't slide.

7846
04:40:00,730 --> 04:40:01,110
Don't make sound.

7847
04:40:02,230 --> 04:40:02,810
We go from the right.

7848
04:40:03,250 --> 04:40:03,570
Ready?

7849
04:40:04,290 --> 04:40:05,070
1, 2, 3.

7850
04:40:05,170 --> 04:40:05,770
Walking with me.

7851
04:40:06,330 --> 04:40:06,950
You bubble in here.

7852
04:40:10,330 --> 04:40:10,650
Bubble.

7853
04:40:12,130 --> 04:40:12,930
Yeah, it's a solo Rampart.

7854
04:40:13,090 --> 04:40:13,510
I'm jumping in.

7855
04:40:14,390 --> 04:40:14,710
70.

7856
04:40:16,670 --> 04:40:17,390
Where is he?

7857
04:40:18,130 --> 04:40:19,350
Where the fuck did he go?

7858
04:40:19,350 --> 04:40:20,650
He like walked.

7859
04:40:20,850 --> 04:40:21,650
I'm gonna get the massive.

7860
04:40:22,010 --> 04:40:23,130
He has nothing too.

7861
04:40:23,230 --> 04:40:23,650
That's good.

7862
04:40:24,650 --> 04:40:27,110
I don't know if there's anyone in this house in front of us here.

7863
04:40:27,570 --> 04:40:29,750
I don't know either.

7864
04:40:30,170 --> 04:40:30,990
They're all over here.

7865
04:40:31,030 --> 04:40:31,730
I don't think there is.

7866
04:40:33,030 --> 04:40:34,170
Do you want me to come over to you?

7867
04:40:34,850 --> 04:40:35,770
Oh, you're scouting.

7868
04:40:36,350 --> 04:40:37,290
There's people in this house.

7869
04:40:38,710 --> 04:40:39,630
I'm looking behind us.

7870
04:40:39,670 --> 04:40:40,110
I'm looking behind.

7871
04:40:42,050 --> 04:40:43,470
Okay, people are fighting over here.

7872
04:40:46,350 --> 04:40:47,630
We want to move, I think.

7873
04:40:47,630 --> 04:40:50,090
Someone just rezzed.

7874
04:40:50,330 --> 04:40:50,730
Oh, fuck.

7875
04:40:50,730 --> 04:40:52,490
There's people in our old house.

7876
04:40:54,810 --> 04:40:55,430
Oh, god.

7877
04:40:55,490 --> 04:40:56,530
They're using our...

7878
04:40:57,290 --> 04:40:57,890
It's fine.

7879
04:40:57,930 --> 04:40:59,430
You can get rid of your own.

7880
04:40:59,710 --> 04:41:01,230
So they don't have cover.

7881
04:41:01,970 --> 04:41:02,870
How do I get rid of them?

7882
04:41:03,750 --> 04:41:04,750
Come to me now.

7883
04:41:05,370 --> 04:41:09,510
Let me know if you need...

7884
04:41:09,510 --> 04:41:10,870
We want to go inside this house.

7885
04:41:10,970 --> 04:41:11,650
I need a bubble.

7886
04:41:13,830 --> 04:41:14,990
We don't have bubble.

7887
04:41:15,850 --> 04:41:16,870
I'm ready to go whenever.

7888
04:41:18,910 --> 04:41:19,790
Slide right here.

7889
04:41:20,430 --> 04:41:20,890
Come with me.

7890
04:41:23,570 --> 04:41:24,110
Move right.

7891
04:41:27,330 --> 04:41:28,630
There might be a team underneath.

7892
04:41:29,230 --> 04:41:29,610
No, there isn't.

7893
04:41:30,930 --> 04:41:31,450
We're safe.

7894
04:41:31,770 --> 04:41:32,510
I have bubble and 8.

7895
04:41:34,170 --> 04:41:34,910
Stay behind me.

7896
04:41:37,630 --> 04:41:39,530
I'm looking behind.

7897
04:41:39,650 --> 04:41:40,030
Just in case.

7898
04:41:40,030 --> 04:41:40,370
Nice.

7899
04:41:40,930 --> 04:41:41,330
Nice.

7900
04:41:45,890 --> 04:41:45,990
Perfect.

7901
04:41:47,590 --> 04:41:48,370
I'm looking here.

7902
04:41:49,490 --> 04:41:50,310
I'm looking here.

7903
04:41:54,230 --> 04:41:55,150
Someone's gotta look front.

7904
04:41:55,210 --> 04:41:55,810
Who's looking at front?

7905
04:41:56,530 --> 04:41:58,890
There's an angle right here that we have to be careful of.

7906
04:41:59,210 --> 04:42:00,210
Look at my red ping.

7907
04:42:00,650 --> 04:42:02,090
Everyone, look at my red ping.

7908
04:42:02,850 --> 04:42:03,770
Careful of that angle.

7909
04:42:04,550 --> 04:42:06,230
On the other side there as well.

7910
04:42:07,130 --> 04:42:08,570
You just have to be careful of it later.

7911
04:42:13,240 --> 04:42:14,260
They're fighting here, I think.

7912
04:42:16,020 --> 04:42:19,600
I'm gonna look in front of us.

7913
04:42:20,180 --> 04:42:22,000
There's some further forward here.

7914
04:42:22,640 --> 04:42:24,200
I'm looking up here just in case for us.

7915
04:42:24,600 --> 04:42:25,840
There's a team right up here.

7916
04:42:26,920 --> 04:42:27,320
One ping.

7917
04:42:27,560 --> 04:42:29,360
Give me bubble on my red ping.

7918
04:42:30,160 --> 04:42:31,620
Do you want me to look?

7919
04:42:31,900 --> 04:42:32,540
Walking at me!

7920
04:42:34,020 --> 04:42:35,320
It's from the house above us.

7921
04:42:35,900 --> 04:42:37,740
Can you look here for us?

7922
04:42:38,000 --> 04:42:39,140
So I can look with the plane.

7923
04:42:45,860 --> 04:42:46,220
75.

7924
04:42:46,220 --> 04:42:46,580
100.

7925
04:42:46,960 --> 04:42:47,900
Oh my god, I missed every shot.

7926
04:42:51,120 --> 04:42:51,960
Can't really do anything.

7927
04:42:52,200 --> 04:42:53,540
Get more covers down here.

7928
04:42:54,260 --> 04:42:55,160
On my red!

7929
04:42:55,540 --> 04:42:55,780
Full team!

7930
04:42:57,640 --> 04:42:58,640
Can I kill one?

7931
04:43:00,760 --> 04:43:01,800
I cracked one, I cracked the other.

7932
04:43:02,500 --> 04:43:02,880
Gara left!

7933
04:43:04,380 --> 04:43:04,860
Gara left!

7934
04:43:07,300 --> 04:43:07,880
They're on the hide.

7935
04:43:08,500 --> 04:43:08,780
Put cover!

7936
04:43:08,780 --> 04:43:09,060
Put cover!

7937
04:43:13,340 --> 04:43:14,480
They're fighting on me.

7938
04:43:15,100 --> 04:43:15,740
I'm here, I'm here.

7939
04:43:16,240 --> 04:43:17,840
You stay here, Gerard.

7940
04:43:19,740 --> 04:43:20,880
They climbed up!

7941
04:43:22,220 --> 04:43:22,920
Nothing we can do.

7942
04:43:23,400 --> 04:43:24,280
Just chill, go back.

7943
04:43:24,640 --> 04:43:26,020
You just stay in your area.

7944
04:43:26,600 --> 04:43:27,720
You're anchoring this.

7945
04:43:28,520 --> 04:43:29,980
We kinda need them to die here.

7946
04:43:30,820 --> 04:43:31,500
They're rezzing.

7947
04:43:31,940 --> 04:43:33,220
Yeah, they're rezzing at the bottom.

7948
04:43:33,600 --> 04:43:34,820
The team above is fully healthy.

7949
04:43:34,820 --> 04:43:35,380
We just chill.

7950
04:43:36,820 --> 04:43:38,180
Look up in front, I'm looking in front.

7951
04:43:42,080 --> 04:43:42,860
They're fighting again.

7952
04:43:46,550 --> 04:43:48,070
I killed one, we just chill again.

7953
04:43:51,690 --> 04:43:52,590
Come to me!

7954
04:43:52,710 --> 04:43:54,290
I'm right behind you!

7955
04:43:55,270 --> 04:43:55,790
We push this!

7956
04:43:57,070 --> 04:43:57,450
Push this!

7957
04:44:00,370 --> 04:44:00,890
On me!

7958
04:44:03,550 --> 04:44:04,550
Bubble out to me!

7959
04:44:04,550 --> 04:44:04,730
Fight!

7960
04:44:06,270 --> 04:44:06,950
Bubble!

7961
04:44:07,330 --> 04:44:08,830
In the corner!

7962
04:44:09,750 --> 04:44:11,110
I'm here!

7963
04:44:13,090 --> 04:44:13,250
Dead!

7964
04:44:15,590 --> 04:44:17,050
We're getting pushed!

7965
04:44:18,090 --> 04:44:19,950
Oh god!

7966
04:44:20,710 --> 04:44:22,810
I got shot by too many things.

7967
04:44:23,830 --> 04:44:24,750
I'm using my shield.

7968
04:44:24,850 --> 04:44:25,430
I'm covering!

7969
04:44:25,690 --> 04:44:26,810
They're pushing up!

7970
04:44:32,250 --> 04:44:34,410
That was a good fight though.

7971
04:44:34,410 --> 04:44:35,310
There was just too many.

7972
04:44:36,150 --> 04:44:37,190
Nothing we can do.

7973
04:44:38,090 --> 04:44:39,650
We got top 10!

7974
04:44:39,870 --> 04:44:43,190
We got top 10 with 5 kills.

7975
04:44:44,370 --> 04:44:46,370
This team is just inting us for no reason.

7976
04:44:46,730 --> 04:44:50,710
They have height and they're just running at us.

7977
04:44:50,790 --> 04:44:51,610
Did they run down from height?

7978
04:44:52,530 --> 04:44:54,050
Oh my god.

7979
04:44:54,550 --> 04:44:55,290
That was stupid.

7980
04:44:57,170 --> 04:44:57,710
That's fine.

7981
04:44:58,690 --> 04:45:00,610
They gave up their height.

7982
04:45:01,610 --> 04:45:02,770
Oh my god.

7983
04:45:02,770 --> 04:45:04,450
That team on height was so lucky.

7984
04:45:04,630 --> 04:45:06,950
If they don't give up their height, they walk in for god spot.

7985
04:45:08,050 --> 04:45:09,350
They can win this game.

7986
04:45:09,610 --> 04:45:09,970
Oh my god.

7987
04:45:09,990 --> 04:45:13,730
This Pathfinder just took the god spot to the side.

7988
04:45:14,610 --> 04:45:17,490
The solo Pathfinder got the god spot.

7989
04:45:18,010 --> 04:45:18,550
That's crazy.

7990
04:45:18,930 --> 04:45:21,050
This was the team that pushed down on us.

7991
04:45:21,470 --> 04:45:22,670
Oh, this was the team?

7992
04:45:23,170 --> 04:45:24,690
This was the team that thirded us.

7993
04:45:24,830 --> 04:45:26,050
They would have had a really good spot.

7994
04:45:26,270 --> 04:45:26,850
They were a full team.

7995
04:45:26,850 --> 04:45:29,270
I mean, now that he's a solo, he...

7996
04:45:29,270 --> 04:45:30,610
Oh, never mind!

7997
04:45:33,070 --> 04:45:35,010
How is he alive?

7998
04:45:35,310 --> 04:45:36,370
Just shut up!

7999
04:45:38,690 --> 04:45:41,550
I was like, why did he run away?

8000
04:45:42,390 --> 04:45:43,290
That is crazy.

8001
04:45:43,570 --> 04:45:46,090
Why did the team run away?

8002
04:45:46,230 --> 04:45:46,950
That's crazy.

8003
04:45:52,650 --> 04:45:54,310
Oh my god.

8004
04:45:55,070 --> 04:45:56,110
I mean, hey.

8005
04:45:56,230 --> 04:45:57,370
That's pretty good.

8006
04:45:57,490 --> 04:45:59,150
Definitely not 20th place now.

8007
04:46:00,290 --> 04:46:00,890
Definitely.

8008
04:46:02,170 --> 04:46:02,770
Let's go.

8009
04:46:04,390 --> 04:46:05,770
That's a lot better now.

8010
04:46:05,770 --> 04:46:06,630
Let's go.

8011
04:46:08,230 --> 04:46:10,590
I think if we get like 20...

8012
04:46:10,590 --> 04:46:12,730
26 points, we should be good, right?

8013
04:46:13,690 --> 04:46:14,630
Like, overall.

8014
04:46:15,250 --> 04:46:17,010
I think 26 points would be top 10.

8015
04:46:17,390 --> 04:46:17,950
Hopefully.

8016
04:46:18,330 --> 04:46:20,570
How many points is 5 plus placement?

8017
04:46:20,790 --> 04:46:21,650
Plus 8th place?

8018
04:46:24,690 --> 04:46:25,490
That's like...

8019
04:46:25,490 --> 04:46:26,810
7 points.

8020
04:46:26,990 --> 04:46:27,570
That's 10?

8021
04:46:27,770 --> 04:46:29,790
Guys, we just need another 10 points.

8022
04:46:29,970 --> 04:46:31,370
And then we're...

8023
04:46:31,370 --> 04:46:34,630
We just need 10 more?

8024
04:46:35,130 --> 04:46:35,610
Wait, did we get 5?

8025
04:46:36,190 --> 04:46:37,590
No, we got 5 kills with 8.

8026
04:46:37,970 --> 04:46:39,970
That's 10 points?

8027
04:46:40,610 --> 04:46:41,150
7.

8028
04:46:41,510 --> 04:46:41,890
7?

8029
04:46:42,050 --> 04:46:43,030
Okay, never mind.

8030
04:46:43,130 --> 04:46:43,890
That's less impressive.

8031
04:46:45,570 --> 04:46:46,110
God.

8032
04:46:47,730 --> 04:46:48,690
That's less...

8033
04:46:49,190 --> 04:46:49,670
Whoa!

8034
04:46:49,910 --> 04:46:51,070
Okay, that was a really good nade.

8035
04:46:51,070 --> 04:46:52,210
Bro, everyone hit him with that.

8036
04:46:52,350 --> 04:46:52,650
Whoa.

8037
04:46:53,090 --> 04:46:54,750
That's a really good nade.

8038
04:46:55,030 --> 04:46:55,090
Yeah.

8039
04:46:58,630 --> 04:47:00,090
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

8040
04:47:00,530 --> 04:47:01,550
Oh my god.

8041
04:47:03,190 --> 04:47:04,390
I'm dead in the...

8042
04:47:04,390 --> 04:47:05,630
The Newcastle played it.

8043
04:47:06,770 --> 04:47:07,250
Yeah.

8044
04:47:08,590 --> 04:47:08,950
Okay.

8045
04:47:09,410 --> 04:47:11,010
They got like 2 shots off on his teammate.

8046
04:47:11,290 --> 04:47:11,550
Yeah.

8047
04:47:13,110 --> 04:47:16,130
Oh, it's a different time.

8048
04:47:16,130 --> 04:47:16,750
It's different.

8049
04:47:17,410 --> 04:47:18,550
Oh, it's later.

8050
04:47:18,750 --> 04:47:19,850
It's a bit later.

8051
04:47:20,110 --> 04:47:22,790
It's 3am PST for me.

8052
04:47:22,890 --> 04:47:24,150
So it's 7...

8053
04:47:24,150 --> 04:47:26,070
7.50pm JST.

8054
04:47:27,330 --> 04:47:28,530
So it's 8pm JST.

8055
04:47:28,630 --> 04:47:30,510
It starts at 8.30pm.

8056
04:47:30,890 --> 04:47:32,950
Oh, it starts at 8.30pm JST.

8057
04:47:33,810 --> 04:47:34,870
So it's a lot later.

8058
04:47:36,790 --> 04:47:38,530
Does that still fuck you over, Gerard?

8059
04:47:39,310 --> 04:47:40,210
No, it's fine.

8060
04:47:40,270 --> 04:47:41,230
It's okay, it's okay.

8061
04:47:41,330 --> 04:47:42,150
It's fine, it's fine.

8062
04:47:44,410 --> 04:47:45,490
It's fine, it's okay.

8063
04:47:45,950 --> 04:47:46,450
It's okay.

8064
04:47:46,450 --> 04:47:47,070
I can still keep going.

8065
04:47:48,950 --> 04:47:50,730
What happened to the passion?

8066
04:47:52,090 --> 04:47:52,750
I can't...

8067
04:47:52,750 --> 04:47:53,790
What happened?

8068
04:47:54,550 --> 04:47:55,770
The passion is here!

8069
04:47:56,630 --> 04:47:57,890
You're like, it's fine.

8070
04:48:00,250 --> 04:48:01,650
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

8071
04:48:01,790 --> 04:48:02,470
I can do this.

8072
04:48:02,530 --> 04:48:03,710
What happened, Gerard?

8073
04:48:03,750 --> 04:48:04,930
What happened to your passion?

8074
04:48:05,150 --> 04:48:05,510
It's gone.

8075
04:48:05,870 --> 04:48:07,670
Sometimes it wavers, sometimes it don't.

8076
04:48:07,670 --> 04:48:08,750
There are times like that.

8077
04:48:08,810 --> 04:48:09,910
I can still go.

8078
04:48:10,890 --> 04:48:14,770
You're just thinking about day 2 and you're just like, what did I agree to?

8079
04:48:15,470 --> 04:48:17,310
Yeah, what did I agree to?

8080
04:48:17,850 --> 04:48:19,470
I thought this was like one day.

8081
04:48:19,750 --> 04:48:21,390
I told you it's two days!

8082
04:48:21,510 --> 04:48:23,590
I said two days!

8083
04:48:24,430 --> 04:48:26,290
I thought it was on a separate day.

8084
04:48:26,330 --> 04:48:27,690
Oh well, it's fine, it's fine.

8085
04:48:28,070 --> 04:48:28,870
It's 8pm, right?

8086
04:48:29,630 --> 04:48:30,510
8pm JST.

8087
04:48:31,170 --> 04:48:31,950
8.30.

8088
04:48:32,890 --> 04:48:34,490
Okay, I can still make it.

8089
04:48:34,490 --> 04:48:36,190
I think I'll be over by that time.

8090
04:48:36,290 --> 04:48:37,850
Okay, I need to use the bathroom.

8091
04:48:37,850 --> 04:48:38,610
I'll be right back, guys.

8092
04:48:39,910 --> 04:48:40,630
Okay, alright.

8093
04:48:42,450 --> 04:48:43,010
Wow.

8094
04:48:43,670 --> 04:48:44,230
Insane.

8095
04:48:45,030 --> 04:48:48,130
Well, I didn't think we'd be making it this far.

8096
04:48:48,730 --> 04:48:51,230
And that was really insane.

8097
04:48:51,850 --> 04:48:55,970
Getting that one dub was enough to fill in.

8098
04:48:56,290 --> 04:48:57,850
To actually make me happy.

8099
04:48:58,390 --> 04:48:59,450
Thank you, thank you so much.

8100
04:49:00,890 --> 04:49:05,170
Whether we lose here or whatever, I like it.

8101
04:49:05,310 --> 04:49:06,410
I like what happened today.

8102
04:49:06,770 --> 04:49:15,190
It feels like I gained new friends and also I feel like I gained some experience.

8103
04:49:15,730 --> 04:49:18,910
And it also gave me insight on how pro players play.

8104
04:49:19,210 --> 04:49:21,170
And my god, that is insane.

8105
04:49:21,550 --> 04:49:26,290
I don't think I can match the current playstyle that they're doing right now.

8106
04:49:26,430 --> 04:49:28,950
But eventually in the future, if I actually get into it.

8107
04:49:29,330 --> 04:49:30,570
But Apex is really fun.

8108
04:49:30,570 --> 04:49:31,890
It's really, really fun.

8109
04:49:32,410 --> 04:49:35,930
I'm happy that I get to play it with both of you.

8110
04:49:36,210 --> 04:49:36,410
Really.

8111
04:49:38,710 --> 04:49:39,190
Yeah.

8112
04:49:39,730 --> 04:49:41,030
It's an opening moment.

8113
04:49:42,890 --> 04:49:45,490
Apex is definitely at its peak in tournaments.

8114
04:49:46,250 --> 04:49:47,130
Oh yeah, definitely.

8115
04:49:47,350 --> 04:49:48,930
The hype is just super insane.

8116
04:49:49,130 --> 04:49:53,190
The strats and everything dude, it's just badonkers.

8117
04:49:54,830 --> 04:50:05,790
When I was so addicted, not really addicted, but when I was really into Apex, I think a few years ago, I would just non-stop watch streamers play solo queue.

8118
04:50:06,130 --> 04:50:07,390
Do you solo queue in Apex?

8119
04:50:09,370 --> 04:50:10,330
Very rarely.

8120
04:50:10,590 --> 04:50:13,130
I mean, I'll solo pubs, but never really ranked.

8121
04:50:13,750 --> 04:50:15,090
Oh yeah, I mean for sure.

8122
04:50:15,230 --> 04:50:18,890
I think the sweatiest people are like, yeah, I don't think you'd be able to do that.

8123
04:50:19,050 --> 04:50:22,110
I mean, probably you can, but I think that's just stupid.

8124
04:50:23,390 --> 04:50:26,510
It's very taxing on the mental.

8125
04:50:26,510 --> 04:50:27,450
What is?

8126
04:50:28,510 --> 04:50:30,030
Like solo queuing.

8127
04:50:30,410 --> 04:50:31,450
Oh no, 100%.

8128
04:50:31,450 --> 04:50:33,490
No, but I still did it yesterday or today.

8129
04:50:35,350 --> 04:50:38,410
Yeah, so we're definitely going for day two.

8130
04:50:38,930 --> 04:50:39,870
Well, we don't know yet.

8131
04:50:39,990 --> 04:50:42,110
We have three more games and we do really well.

8132
04:50:42,330 --> 04:50:47,990
The thing is, the next three games is Flame's actual LGS drop spot.

8133
04:50:49,130 --> 04:50:50,130
So he's very familiar.

8134
04:50:52,350 --> 04:50:55,270
So like, we have a lot of expectations.

8135
04:51:03,830 --> 04:51:08,390
The thing is that we just need one really good game and then we get top ten.

8136
04:51:09,190 --> 04:51:11,090
It literally only takes one good game.

8137
04:51:13,210 --> 04:51:14,010
One good game.

8138
04:51:15,230 --> 04:51:15,470
Yeah.

8139
04:51:16,990 --> 04:51:17,470
Okay.

8140
04:51:19,050 --> 04:51:19,650
So.

8141
04:51:21,930 --> 04:51:22,970
Holy shit!

8142
04:51:22,970 --> 04:51:24,730
Oh my god, here's the rotation.

8143
04:51:26,050 --> 04:51:27,330
Red is hitting console.

8144
04:51:27,590 --> 04:51:28,910
So that's you, Drag.

8145
04:51:29,070 --> 04:51:31,210
Drag, you gotta know how to do this.

8146
04:51:33,690 --> 04:51:34,170
Rotation.

8147
04:51:34,530 --> 04:51:35,530
Yeah, that's how you loot.

8148
04:51:35,690 --> 04:51:40,550
Yeah, so you land at the side that doesn't have an arrow.

8149
04:51:40,930 --> 04:51:42,870
So the arrow is like where you end it.

8150
04:51:43,390 --> 04:51:44,630
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

8151
04:51:44,950 --> 04:51:51,530
So you land on the two bins, loot into the pyramid, you go right and then into the houses.

8152
04:51:52,570 --> 04:51:55,690
Usually you want to hit console as soon as you're done with the two houses.

8153
04:51:56,570 --> 04:51:59,550
And Doki, you and I have to swap between yellow.

8154
04:52:00,150 --> 04:52:02,570
Actually, no, both you and I can hit support bins.

8155
04:52:03,950 --> 04:52:05,990
You take yellow, I take blue.

8156
04:52:06,390 --> 04:52:09,090
I land on the far right, right?

8157
04:52:09,530 --> 04:52:12,290
So like, the yellow arrow is where we end, right?

8158
04:52:13,190 --> 04:52:14,670
Alright, I got it.

8159
04:52:15,910 --> 04:52:17,330
We're doing homework, guys.

8160
04:52:17,330 --> 04:52:17,810
This is...

8161
04:52:20,010 --> 04:52:22,350
This is our homework real quick.

8162
04:52:24,330 --> 04:52:25,510
I'm putting this on my other chest.

8163
04:52:25,510 --> 04:52:26,810
Wow, I should have known this beforehand.

8164
04:52:27,030 --> 04:52:29,670
I must have been stealing a bunch of your materials.

8165
04:52:29,890 --> 04:52:30,010
Whoops.

8166
04:52:30,490 --> 04:52:32,250
No, this is a new drop spot.

8167
04:52:32,410 --> 04:52:33,150
This is a new one.

8168
04:52:33,790 --> 04:52:34,250
Oh, okay.

8169
04:52:34,510 --> 04:52:36,370
We're going in now.

8170
04:52:38,190 --> 04:52:39,790
Okay, I gotta check.

8171
04:52:41,690 --> 04:52:42,630
Where are we?

8172
04:52:44,250 --> 04:52:45,510
Okay, so it's here.

8173
04:52:50,150 --> 04:52:51,350
Oh, okay, that's fine.

8174
04:52:51,650 --> 04:52:53,130
Gotta land here, okay.

8175
04:52:53,430 --> 04:52:58,210
Remember, gotta land over here.

8176
04:52:58,310 --> 04:52:59,090
Okay, alright.

8177
04:52:59,550 --> 04:53:00,430
Got it to the T.

8178
04:53:01,950 --> 04:53:05,950
You wanna make sure you hit console as soon as possible.

8179
04:53:08,430 --> 04:53:10,290
Oh my god, we're doing our homework.

8180
04:53:11,610 --> 04:53:12,790
I have a triple take, do you want it?

8181
04:53:14,170 --> 04:53:15,110
Uh, yeah, I want it.

8182
04:53:15,250 --> 04:53:15,570
Okay.

8183
04:53:15,570 --> 04:53:15,670
Okay.

8184
04:53:16,990 --> 04:53:17,770
Thank you.

8185
04:53:21,130 --> 04:53:23,390
There's also a stock here too.

8186
04:53:23,990 --> 04:53:24,510
Yup.

8187
04:53:24,910 --> 04:53:26,270
Okay, just checking, just checking.

8188
04:53:26,550 --> 04:53:28,850
Oh my god, did my homework.

8189
04:53:29,590 --> 04:53:31,930
I'm doing it, I'm doing it, I'm doing it.

8190
04:53:32,010 --> 04:53:33,070
Doing our homework.

8191
04:53:34,210 --> 04:53:35,010
Who's picking up?

8192
04:53:35,370 --> 04:53:38,230
Did you do your homework at school?

8193
04:53:38,870 --> 04:53:39,350
No.

8194
04:53:39,670 --> 04:53:40,550
I never fucking did.

8195
04:53:41,430 --> 04:53:44,330
That's why we're streamers now.

8196
04:53:46,730 --> 04:53:49,750
That's why we're streamers.

8197
04:53:55,450 --> 04:53:57,410
I did my homework.

8198
04:53:57,590 --> 04:53:59,890
I used to be a really good student.

8199
04:54:00,830 --> 04:54:02,530
Yeah, and then I discovered.

8200
04:54:03,090 --> 04:54:03,290
Honors.

8201
04:54:04,160 --> 04:54:04,990
You were honors?

8202
04:54:04,990 --> 04:54:08,530
But you didn't do your homework?

8203
04:54:08,910 --> 04:54:09,950
Well, cramming.

8204
04:54:10,250 --> 04:54:12,670
Like, I would do it during the class itself.

8205
04:54:12,670 --> 04:54:16,030
We need to hit, just hit console and then we're hitting cash and leaving.

8206
04:54:16,910 --> 04:54:17,150
Yeah.

8207
04:54:20,450 --> 04:54:21,750
I have everything I need.

8208
04:54:22,550 --> 04:54:23,370
Console time.

8209
04:54:24,890 --> 04:54:25,750
Console, console.

8210
04:54:26,950 --> 04:54:28,170
They're poking now.

8211
04:54:28,650 --> 04:54:29,150
It's on me.

8212
04:54:30,610 --> 04:54:31,670
Console, okay, okay.

8213
04:54:32,970 --> 04:54:34,250
Yeah, okay, okay.

8214
04:54:34,310 --> 04:54:37,470
Don't worry, we have like two more games for you to practice this rotation.

8215
04:54:39,910 --> 04:54:42,270
I think Cascades might be rotating to us here.

8216
04:54:42,270 --> 04:54:43,370
Yeah, I think so too.

8217
04:54:43,510 --> 04:54:44,330
I want this cash.

8218
04:54:45,990 --> 04:54:48,370
There's a redeploy right there if we need it.

8219
04:54:50,610 --> 04:54:52,150
They're sitting on the cash.

8220
04:54:52,870 --> 04:54:53,430
That's annoying.

8221
04:54:53,930 --> 04:54:55,290
The zone might be on us, I'm not sure.

8222
04:54:55,810 --> 04:54:56,230
Not again.

8223
04:55:00,550 --> 04:55:01,890
Okay, I'm on my way.

8224
04:55:02,010 --> 04:55:02,430
To you?

8225
04:55:03,190 --> 04:55:04,030
No, no, hit the console.

8226
04:55:04,650 --> 04:55:05,650
Zone, zone, zone.

8227
04:55:08,950 --> 04:55:10,290
Are they sprinting at me?

8228
04:55:11,490 --> 04:55:11,810
Okay.

8229
04:55:12,150 --> 04:55:13,790
I don't have a bubble, I had to give it to him.

8230
04:55:14,130 --> 04:55:15,310
Yeah, I'm right here.

8231
04:55:15,890 --> 04:55:16,430
Where are you?

8232
04:55:16,510 --> 04:55:17,670
I'm coming over to you.

8233
04:55:17,970 --> 04:55:18,950
I think it is on us.

8234
04:55:20,110 --> 04:55:21,250
Yeah, you guys have to.

8235
04:55:21,570 --> 04:55:22,870
They're running above me.

8236
04:55:24,030 --> 04:55:24,810
I don't have scope.

8237
04:55:26,710 --> 04:55:28,550
I got a scope here.

8238
04:55:29,630 --> 04:55:30,870
Run slow behind, run slow behind.

8239
04:55:31,010 --> 04:55:31,510
Look at the guy behind.

8240
04:55:33,410 --> 04:55:34,290
Twelve, I hit twelve.

8241
04:55:34,470 --> 04:55:35,430
I don't have scope, by the way.

8242
04:55:36,090 --> 04:55:37,810
Here, here, take it, take it.

8243
04:55:37,810 --> 04:55:38,930
He's running past the bubble.

8244
04:55:41,610 --> 04:55:43,950
Just don't be in open, don't be in open when you do that.

8245
04:55:44,190 --> 04:55:45,810
Okay, okay, here, here, take it, take it, take it.

8246
04:55:46,210 --> 04:55:48,050
Wait, uh, we just grabbed the cash here.

8247
04:55:48,270 --> 04:55:49,010
We're not behind them.

8248
04:55:49,710 --> 04:55:51,490
I want to be in barrel here.

8249
04:55:51,690 --> 04:55:53,450
Do we have an evac?

8250
04:55:53,790 --> 04:55:55,170
Doki, can you come towards me on the evac?

8251
04:55:55,590 --> 04:55:57,450
Yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming.

8252
04:56:00,260 --> 04:56:01,240
Do it like here.

8253
04:56:01,540 --> 04:56:01,840
Yeah.

8254
04:56:04,200 --> 04:56:05,060
You can evac now.

8255
04:56:07,080 --> 04:56:07,440
Alright.

8256
04:56:09,660 --> 04:56:11,380
We want to go right into spiders here.

8257
04:56:12,160 --> 04:56:12,800
I'll wait for you.

8258
04:56:13,440 --> 04:56:14,120
Yeah, go now.

8259
04:56:19,020 --> 04:56:20,400
Someone might be at that house.

8260
04:56:20,540 --> 04:56:22,240
I think we should fight for it, to be honest.

8261
04:56:23,080 --> 04:56:23,660
I have bubble.

8262
04:56:23,960 --> 04:56:25,460
Droid is not healed though, that's the thing.

8263
04:56:27,020 --> 04:56:27,680
No, it's okay.

8264
04:56:28,640 --> 04:56:30,420
I have one shield bat.

8265
04:56:31,180 --> 04:56:31,880
Do you have shield cells?

8266
04:56:31,960 --> 04:56:32,500
I can give you shield cells.

8267
04:56:32,560 --> 04:56:33,440
Do you want us to use spiders?

8268
04:56:33,480 --> 04:56:37,380
Come here, come here, come here.

8269
04:56:42,490 --> 04:56:43,450
I'm right behind you.

8270
04:56:45,030 --> 04:56:46,410
There's a cache next to us.

8271
04:56:47,510 --> 04:56:47,590
Yeah.

8272
04:56:47,970 --> 04:56:49,550
Need to clear this house first.

8273
04:56:51,930 --> 04:56:52,750
Can you bubble in?

8274
04:56:53,130 --> 04:56:53,310
Yep.

8275
04:56:54,110 --> 04:56:55,290
Someone's routing, we might die.

8276
04:56:56,010 --> 04:56:56,910
Nope, everything's fine.

8277
04:56:57,350 --> 04:56:59,030
We just hold now.

8278
04:57:00,170 --> 04:57:01,690
On the roof, on the roof here.

8279
04:57:01,850 --> 04:57:03,170
One, two, three, shooting.

8280
04:57:04,110 --> 04:57:05,210
Am I stupid?

8281
04:57:06,450 --> 04:57:07,670
How did I miss that?

8282
04:57:07,830 --> 04:57:09,250
I missed that too.

8283
04:57:09,750 --> 04:57:11,130
I'm going to grab the triple-tag.

8284
04:57:11,970 --> 04:57:14,710
Okay, we can do spiders and we can grab the cache.

8285
04:57:15,370 --> 04:57:15,990
I've dropped it.

8286
04:57:19,050 --> 04:57:20,710
You might need to bubble me here.

8287
04:57:20,830 --> 04:57:21,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

8288
04:57:21,630 --> 04:57:22,430
I'm heading out.

8289
04:57:22,710 --> 04:57:25,130
You stay here, Droid.

8290
04:57:25,690 --> 04:57:27,190
I'll let you know if I need bubble.

8291
04:57:28,210 --> 04:57:28,370
Okay.

8292
04:57:28,990 --> 04:57:29,690
Did you get it?

8293
04:57:31,170 --> 04:57:32,650
Landing here in the open, look, look, look.

8294
04:57:32,770 --> 04:57:33,870
Okay, I'm looking, turn around.

8295
04:57:35,210 --> 04:57:35,750
I don't see it.

8296
04:57:36,610 --> 04:57:37,870
They've already gone underneath.

8297
04:57:40,030 --> 04:57:41,210
Okay, I'm still inside the house.

8298
04:57:41,250 --> 04:57:42,030
Yeah, just stay there.

8299
04:57:42,350 --> 04:57:43,330
I'm going to do spiders then.

8300
04:57:44,330 --> 04:57:45,490
Uh, yeah, we can.

8301
04:57:46,570 --> 04:57:47,710
I'm just going to do spiders from here.

8302
04:57:48,650 --> 04:57:51,010
You have to make sure no one walks up on this cannon here.

8303
04:57:51,270 --> 04:57:51,590
Yeah.

8304
04:57:52,310 --> 04:57:53,450
In the open, in the open here.

8305
04:57:53,950 --> 04:57:54,970
You have to stay right there, Droid.

8306
04:57:56,910 --> 04:57:57,410
I'm looking.

8307
04:57:58,110 --> 04:57:58,930
Is he, is gone?

8308
04:57:59,730 --> 04:58:01,530
No, he's behind us.

8309
04:58:01,810 --> 04:58:03,170
Yeah, he grabbed the cache, he grabbed the cache.

8310
04:58:03,170 --> 04:58:04,070
Oh shit, okay.

8311
04:58:04,830 --> 04:58:05,990
They're running up here.

8312
04:58:07,750 --> 04:58:09,050
He's running in the open right now.

8313
04:58:09,070 --> 04:58:10,210
50, cracked him, he's 1.

8314
04:58:10,930 --> 04:58:12,150
He bubbled, he bubbled, he bubbled.

8315
04:58:13,390 --> 04:58:14,870
I don't have an angle on that.

8316
04:58:15,650 --> 04:58:16,090
Yeah, I'm good.

8317
04:58:16,790 --> 04:58:17,610
There's like 50 HP.

8318
04:58:18,270 --> 04:58:21,130
I'm going to

8319
04:58:28,740 --> 04:58:29,360
grab this helmet.

8320
04:58:31,420 --> 04:58:32,800
I need this ammo actually.

8321
04:58:33,720 --> 04:58:34,000
Yeah.

8322
04:58:35,180 --> 04:58:37,280
Do you have the rest of the ammo?

8323
04:58:37,600 --> 04:58:38,800
No, I can't.

8324
04:58:38,800 --> 04:58:39,480
Okay, I'll grab more.

8325
04:58:41,160 --> 04:58:43,160
I already kind of have everything.

8326
04:58:43,960 --> 04:58:45,560
Alright, I have everything I need too.

8327
04:58:48,480 --> 04:58:50,740
Is the team just playing on the prairie here?

8328
04:58:50,740 --> 04:58:52,100
I'm playing in the house.

8329
04:58:52,440 --> 04:58:53,920
Just to have a better angle.

8330
04:58:54,960 --> 04:58:56,400
On the right side.

8331
04:58:57,320 --> 04:58:58,640
I'm looking west.

8332
04:58:59,940 --> 04:59:00,280
Yep.

8333
04:59:00,640 --> 04:59:01,220
I'll look west.

8334
04:59:02,280 --> 04:59:03,540
Droid's looking north.

8335
04:59:03,920 --> 04:59:06,080
Get some covers outside here, Droid.

8336
04:59:06,080 --> 04:59:07,780
Droid, put cover outside.

8337
04:59:08,260 --> 04:59:09,840
Outside, in front.

8338
04:59:10,740 --> 04:59:12,900
Make sure it doesn't block the door.

8339
04:59:14,560 --> 04:59:15,200
Yeah, I mean that's fine.

8340
04:59:15,300 --> 04:59:17,460
If you can put a cover on the left here as well, that'd be pretty good.

8341
04:59:18,100 --> 04:59:19,740
Whoa, that scared the shit out of me.

8342
04:59:19,740 --> 04:59:20,420
Holy fuck.

8343
04:59:21,100 --> 04:59:22,480
I'm looking north right now.

8344
04:59:22,980 --> 04:59:24,780
No, there is a piece of cover there.

8345
04:59:24,820 --> 04:59:25,320
There's no way.

8346
04:59:26,420 --> 04:59:29,660
I don't know what, but I'm shooting through him.

8347
04:59:31,520 --> 04:59:32,560
Gang issue, maybe?

8348
04:59:32,560 --> 04:59:33,900
Inside the next room.

8349
04:59:34,320 --> 04:59:35,540
I don't know, honestly.

8350
04:59:36,840 --> 04:59:37,760
Shit, they're fighting there.

8351
04:59:38,740 --> 04:59:39,800
Wait, we're all looking at the same area.

8352
04:59:39,940 --> 04:59:40,720
I'm looking...

8353
04:59:40,720 --> 04:59:44,220
Droid, look at a different angle for us.

8354
04:59:44,560 --> 04:59:46,000
Yeah, I'm looking behind here.

8355
04:59:46,120 --> 04:59:46,800
Is this okay?

8356
04:59:47,100 --> 04:59:48,920
Yeah, that's good.

8357
04:59:49,200 --> 04:59:56,820
I don't know if we drop off for this.

8358
04:59:57,300 --> 04:59:59,480
Not drop off, but the angle.

8359
05:00:01,760 --> 05:00:02,540
Hostile spotted.

8360
05:00:05,970 --> 05:00:07,070
Can you hit that guy?

8361
05:00:07,190 --> 05:00:08,530
I can't, no.

8362
05:00:09,990 --> 05:00:12,030
There's a cover right there.

8363
05:00:12,250 --> 05:00:13,830
I swear, I swear there is.

8364
05:00:14,930 --> 05:00:15,890
We might need a canoe cover.

8365
05:00:16,090 --> 05:00:16,930
We need another cover here.

8366
05:00:16,930 --> 05:00:18,090
We need a new wall droid.

8367
05:00:18,990 --> 05:00:19,630
Okay, alright.

8368
05:00:22,170 --> 05:00:23,290
Destroy it, destroy it.

8369
05:00:24,250 --> 05:00:25,070
Yeah, you can.

8370
05:00:25,130 --> 05:00:27,570
One, two, three, four, five.

8371
05:00:27,630 --> 05:00:28,510
Okay, there's five.

8372
05:00:28,650 --> 05:00:32,470
I was wondering if we should wall the bottom just in case, but I don't know.

8373
05:00:32,570 --> 05:00:33,830
Yeah, definitely should.

8374
05:00:33,830 --> 05:00:35,070
Yeah, droid, droid, come here.

8375
05:00:35,310 --> 05:00:37,550
Take this, take this away, take this away.

8376
05:00:38,090 --> 05:00:39,790
And then wall here.

8377
05:00:40,210 --> 05:00:40,770
Down here.

8378
05:00:41,210 --> 05:00:42,870
So we know if somebody comes down.

8379
05:01:01,350 --> 05:01:01,710
Okay.

8380
05:01:02,550 --> 05:01:05,590
Let us know your cooldowns, because we need to re-wall places.

8381
05:01:07,370 --> 05:01:08,130
Yeah, it's fine, it's fine.

8382
05:01:08,190 --> 05:01:08,750
I got it, I got it.

8383
05:01:09,090 --> 05:01:09,450
Outside?

8384
05:01:11,230 --> 05:01:12,390
Wait, wait two seconds.

8385
05:01:15,130 --> 05:01:16,970
No, okay, I didn't get the door I think on.

8386
05:01:17,150 --> 05:01:18,050
Alright, you can start pulling.

8387
05:01:18,050 --> 05:01:18,450
There.

8388
05:01:20,430 --> 05:01:22,350
And then, droid, come over here.

8389
05:01:22,770 --> 05:01:24,230
Can you do it against the door or no?

8390
05:01:24,550 --> 05:01:25,510
I don't know if you can.

8391
05:01:26,010 --> 05:01:26,890
This is too thick.

8392
05:01:27,930 --> 05:01:29,050
Or like too wide.

8393
05:01:30,010 --> 05:01:31,170
Can you do it against it?

8394
05:01:31,830 --> 05:01:34,390
Like just on this, yeah, like on like here.

8395
05:01:35,210 --> 05:01:36,010
Like blue, just...

8396
05:01:36,010 --> 05:01:37,770
It's showing me red, I can't...

8397
05:01:37,770 --> 05:01:38,610
Okay, but you can.

8398
05:01:38,650 --> 05:01:40,210
I don't know if you can for this door.

8399
05:01:40,830 --> 05:01:42,130
Wait, wait, um...

8400
05:01:44,450 --> 05:01:46,070
Gotta be extra...

8401
05:01:46,070 --> 05:01:47,330
How do you...

8402
05:01:47,330 --> 05:01:48,190
You can, that's fine.

8403
05:01:48,430 --> 05:01:49,650
I was just curious if you could.

8404
05:01:52,030 --> 05:01:53,030
The team on upper barrels.

8405
05:01:53,070 --> 05:01:54,490
It's only available on that one.

8406
05:01:54,730 --> 05:01:55,630
Okay, that's fine.

8407
05:01:57,490 --> 05:01:58,390
Then we should be good.

8408
05:02:03,830 --> 05:02:05,630
Oh, can you put a cover on my right here?

8409
05:02:06,310 --> 05:02:07,510
One, two, three.

8410
05:02:07,510 --> 05:02:08,090
Yeah, we have a lot.

8411
05:02:08,250 --> 05:02:08,970
One, two, three, four.

8412
05:02:10,930 --> 05:02:11,590
You look in front of you?

8413
05:02:12,310 --> 05:02:13,430
Yeah, just on the right.

8414
05:02:14,110 --> 05:02:15,030
We still have one more door.

8415
05:02:15,390 --> 05:02:15,790
Thank you.

8416
05:02:15,790 --> 05:02:16,170
Oh!

8417
05:02:18,130 --> 05:02:18,710
On me?

8418
05:02:19,070 --> 05:02:20,150
Okay, he's...

8419
05:02:22,250 --> 05:02:23,070
Should I give you a shield?

8420
05:02:23,550 --> 05:02:24,130
Yeah, definitely.

8421
05:02:24,650 --> 05:02:25,590
Just in case they cross again.

8422
05:02:27,430 --> 05:02:28,710
Okay, you look this side.

8423
05:02:29,930 --> 05:02:30,870
I'm gonna look here.

8424
05:02:31,410 --> 05:02:32,310
I wanna see what they're gonna go through.

8425
05:02:33,530 --> 05:02:34,570
They're shooting over here.

8426
05:02:35,430 --> 05:02:36,410
Someone's fighting over here.

8427
05:02:36,770 --> 05:02:38,310
I don't see them.

8428
05:02:38,430 --> 05:02:38,910
I see bullets.

8429
05:02:39,090 --> 05:02:41,650
Okay, if you see people standing in the open, let us know and we'll shoot.

8430
05:02:42,110 --> 05:02:43,390
And we'll take spots.

8431
05:02:44,050 --> 05:02:44,890
Oh my god.

8432
05:02:45,430 --> 05:02:46,250
Okay, you IGL.

8433
05:02:46,950 --> 05:02:47,690
You're doing great.

8434
05:02:47,890 --> 05:02:48,850
Oh, thank you.

8435
05:02:49,810 --> 05:02:51,050
I don't like IGLing.

8436
05:02:51,130 --> 05:02:52,030
It's too much stress.

8437
05:02:52,730 --> 05:02:53,950
What the hell is IGL?

8438
05:02:54,290 --> 05:02:55,010
In-game leader.

8439
05:02:56,270 --> 05:02:56,630
Oh.

8440
05:02:58,310 --> 05:02:59,450
It's too much work.

8441
05:03:00,450 --> 05:03:01,790
Oh, car, car, car on the left.

8442
05:03:01,890 --> 05:03:02,610
Okay, I'm looking for you.

8443
05:03:04,070 --> 05:03:05,810
They stopped in the open right now.

8444
05:03:06,290 --> 05:03:06,630
See them?

8445
05:03:06,950 --> 05:03:07,610
They're straight up in the open.

8446
05:03:07,710 --> 05:03:08,010
They don't have a bubble.

8447
05:03:08,430 --> 05:03:08,690
Okay.

8448
05:03:10,090 --> 05:03:11,030
I don't see them yet.

8449
05:03:12,130 --> 05:03:12,930
They're like...

8450
05:03:12,930 --> 05:03:14,290
I don't have an angle on this.

8451
05:03:14,570 --> 05:03:15,510
Yeah, it's really hard.

8452
05:03:16,890 --> 05:03:18,070
Can we see from the door?

8453
05:03:18,470 --> 05:03:19,850
Yeah, can you see from this side?

8454
05:03:20,410 --> 05:03:20,890
Do they bubble?

8455
05:03:23,210 --> 05:03:24,930
I'm gonna look back on my end.

8456
05:03:26,270 --> 05:03:27,070
Bin's refreshed.

8457
05:03:27,590 --> 05:03:29,890
Oh, there's a mythic bin right there.

8458
05:03:30,410 --> 05:03:30,850
I can what?

8459
05:03:30,890 --> 05:03:31,130
Bubble?

8460
05:03:31,330 --> 05:03:32,610
Oh, that's the corner.

8461
05:03:32,730 --> 05:03:33,630
That's with them.

8462
05:03:33,970 --> 05:03:36,030
I just mean we might be able to shoot people.

8463
05:03:37,370 --> 05:03:38,910
Let me know and I'll rotate.

8464
05:03:38,910 --> 05:03:41,450
This team's getting bullied right now.

8465
05:03:45,770 --> 05:03:46,730
Someone died.

8466
05:03:46,730 --> 05:03:47,990
Can you give me another wall here?

8467
05:03:48,270 --> 05:03:49,930
Car, car, car!

8468
05:03:50,770 --> 05:03:52,170
They took the middle spot.

8469
05:03:53,670 --> 05:03:54,950
That spot is really good.

8470
05:03:55,950 --> 05:03:56,970
That's the spot I wanted.

8471
05:03:59,130 --> 05:03:59,970
Enemy, enemy!

8472
05:04:00,670 --> 05:04:01,190
Okay, I'm looking.

8473
05:04:05,230 --> 05:04:06,930
Your gun shield is crazy.

8474
05:04:08,910 --> 05:04:11,030
They're like all the way to the far right there.

8475
05:04:11,110 --> 05:04:12,030
So I can't do anything.

8476
05:04:17,090 --> 05:04:20,450
Bro, I swear this new castle is like...

8477
05:04:20,450 --> 05:04:21,410
Spinboarding.

8478
05:04:21,770 --> 05:04:23,090
I can't handle it.

8479
05:04:24,170 --> 05:04:27,810
The moment your shot looks at him, he just...

8480
05:04:28,500 --> 05:04:29,310
It just turns.

8481
05:04:30,630 --> 05:04:32,310
He just turns like...

8482
05:04:32,310 --> 05:04:33,490
Just a tiny bit.

8483
05:04:33,630 --> 05:04:35,350
Man, they're shooting something over there.

8484
05:04:36,290 --> 05:04:37,530
We'll never know.

8485
05:04:37,750 --> 05:04:38,530
But I can't see it.

8486
05:04:38,530 --> 05:04:40,790
We need a cover here.

8487
05:04:43,870 --> 05:04:44,510
Refresh.

8488
05:04:45,510 --> 05:04:46,730
Thank you.

8489
05:04:47,850 --> 05:04:49,910
Someone landed on this hotdog.

8490
05:04:50,930 --> 05:04:52,250
Team over here is...

8491
05:04:52,250 --> 05:04:53,730
Keep looking.

8492
05:04:54,290 --> 05:04:56,930
We just need to make sure nobody pushes up.

8493
05:04:59,250 --> 05:04:59,690
Oh shit.

8494
05:05:03,410 --> 05:05:04,410
Shots on cannon.

8495
05:05:04,870 --> 05:05:05,530
Okay, I'm heading over.

8496
05:05:05,530 --> 05:05:06,550
Come to me.

8497
05:05:06,630 --> 05:05:07,610
You stay.

8498
05:05:08,910 --> 05:05:12,470
Stay and make sure our spot is still there.

8499
05:05:12,590 --> 05:05:13,350
They're fighting.

8500
05:05:14,270 --> 05:05:14,990
I'm over.

8501
05:05:16,230 --> 05:05:17,030
They might have finished.

8502
05:05:18,070 --> 05:05:19,530
Is it worth it?

8503
05:05:20,030 --> 05:05:21,150
You can just go back.

8504
05:05:21,370 --> 05:05:22,310
I'll go back.

8505
05:05:22,430 --> 05:05:23,830
Just stay there and make presence.

8506
05:05:24,010 --> 05:05:24,910
Oh shit, they're red.

8507
05:05:25,790 --> 05:05:26,890
It's fine.

8508
05:05:31,210 --> 05:05:32,810
I have to run back.

8509
05:05:32,950 --> 05:05:34,330
They're walking at me.

8510
05:05:34,330 --> 05:05:34,550
Okay.

8511
05:05:35,730 --> 05:05:36,810
Dread, can you open the door?

8512
05:05:37,670 --> 05:05:39,350
Come downstairs and open the door for us.

8513
05:05:40,330 --> 05:05:41,070
Come downstairs, Dread.

8514
05:05:41,210 --> 05:05:41,690
Open the door.

8515
05:05:45,390 --> 05:05:46,270
Here, thank you.

8516
05:05:46,850 --> 05:05:47,490
Just close the door again.

8517
05:05:48,850 --> 05:05:50,190
Dread, we swap spots.

8518
05:05:50,310 --> 05:05:52,030
We're getting megadrilled from cannon now.

8519
05:05:52,170 --> 05:05:53,090
We're getting megadrilled from cannon.

8520
05:05:54,250 --> 05:05:55,010
Okay, you look there.

8521
05:05:55,150 --> 05:05:56,470
They're gonna be a pain in the ass.

8522
05:05:57,930 --> 05:05:59,630
Liam and I are just gonna check up.

8523
05:05:59,630 --> 05:06:01,130
They're fighting down here.

8524
05:06:01,130 --> 05:06:02,290
They're not.

8525
05:06:02,850 --> 05:06:05,050
I'm looking at the right side then.

8526
05:06:06,270 --> 05:06:07,410
Cannon is still our biggest threat.

8527
05:06:07,790 --> 05:06:08,370
They're right here.

8528
05:06:10,130 --> 05:06:10,650
I have 56.

8529
05:06:11,150 --> 05:06:12,090
I'm looking back.

8530
05:06:12,250 --> 05:06:13,850
I'm looking back at us.

8531
05:06:14,590 --> 05:06:16,130
I've been drilled on the outside again.

8532
05:06:16,230 --> 05:06:20,090
I'm looking here because they're getting poked heavily.

8533
05:06:20,230 --> 05:06:21,630
There's someone peeking from the zone here.

8534
05:06:21,870 --> 05:06:22,070
Castle.

8535
05:06:25,050 --> 05:06:26,310
I'm just looking at this.

8536
05:06:27,830 --> 05:06:28,510
They're getting pushed.

8537
05:06:28,510 --> 05:06:29,330
Look at zone.

8538
05:06:29,890 --> 05:06:31,290
We have to move to here.

8539
05:06:32,370 --> 05:06:33,690
Look at this.

8540
05:06:33,810 --> 05:06:34,410
I got one.

8541
05:06:35,290 --> 05:06:36,070
Look at this.

8542
05:06:36,210 --> 05:06:38,270
There's a full fight here.

8543
05:06:40,810 --> 05:06:41,590
I got kill.

8544
05:06:42,630 --> 05:06:44,590
We have to move.

8545
05:06:45,370 --> 05:06:46,070
This team is moving.

8546
05:06:46,550 --> 05:06:47,570
I'm ready to move whenever.

8547
05:06:49,610 --> 05:06:50,690
I think we should move now.

8548
05:06:51,450 --> 05:06:52,010
Come with me.

8549
05:06:53,730 --> 05:06:54,850
This is gonna be really hard.

8550
05:06:55,690 --> 05:06:56,110
Just run with me.

8551
05:06:56,110 --> 05:06:56,430
Keep running.

8552
05:06:58,670 --> 05:07:00,130
We're going under here.

8553
05:07:00,570 --> 05:07:01,870
Then we're taking bottom floor of this house.

8554
05:07:02,170 --> 05:07:03,070
Keep coming.

8555
05:07:03,590 --> 05:07:04,910
Don't look back.

8556
05:07:06,710 --> 05:07:08,290
I'll bubble when we really need it.

8557
05:07:09,230 --> 05:07:10,290
Sit behind me.

8558
05:07:10,390 --> 05:07:11,270
Sit behind me for 2 seconds.

8559
05:07:14,510 --> 05:07:15,390
Climb up.

8560
05:07:15,530 --> 05:07:16,850
1, 2, 3, climbing.

8561
05:07:18,170 --> 05:07:19,350
Bubble us on this door.

8562
05:07:22,050 --> 05:07:22,930
Come inside.

8563
05:07:25,070 --> 05:07:25,530
100.

8564
05:07:26,050 --> 05:07:26,570
I got one.

8565
05:07:26,730 --> 05:07:26,910
Fight.

8566
05:07:28,610 --> 05:07:29,530
Last guy.

8567
05:07:31,010 --> 05:07:31,650
Just heal.

8568
05:07:33,670 --> 05:07:34,590
Put walls.

8569
05:07:34,930 --> 05:07:36,330
Come to me.

8570
05:07:37,270 --> 05:07:38,230
There's a full team there.

8571
05:07:38,430 --> 05:07:38,750
Come to me.

8572
05:07:39,810 --> 05:07:40,530
We just have to chill.

8573
05:07:42,490 --> 05:07:43,990
There's a golden PK right here.

8574
05:07:44,270 --> 05:07:45,390
Can you come to us?

8575
05:07:46,250 --> 05:07:47,150
Put walls down.

8576
05:07:49,710 --> 05:07:50,770
Put wall here.

8577
05:07:50,770 --> 05:07:51,670
Put wall here.

8578
05:07:53,150 --> 05:07:54,350
I'm peeking outside.

8579
05:07:56,190 --> 05:07:57,550
I don't know what's going on.

8580
05:07:57,610 --> 05:07:59,170
There might be another team.

8581
05:08:00,250 --> 05:08:01,010
There's an R9.

8582
05:08:01,110 --> 05:08:01,750
I'm getting the R9.

8583
05:08:05,570 --> 05:08:06,450
I'm healing.

8584
05:08:06,910 --> 05:08:07,670
I have an R9.

8585
05:08:08,190 --> 05:08:09,930
I'm only close range.

8586
05:08:12,550 --> 05:08:13,410
They're rezzing.

8587
05:08:16,070 --> 05:08:17,310
They're rezzing right under me.

8588
05:08:17,630 --> 05:08:18,670
You want me to come down?

8589
05:08:18,670 --> 05:08:19,730
I have R9 on me.

8590
05:08:19,950 --> 05:08:21,430
Come look at this.

8591
05:08:23,190 --> 05:08:23,750
I killed one.

8592
05:08:25,670 --> 05:08:26,130
Gibby's one.

8593
05:08:27,170 --> 05:08:27,690
Gibby's one.

8594
05:08:28,450 --> 05:08:29,170
Come back.

8595
05:08:30,410 --> 05:08:31,530
Come back.

8596
05:08:32,410 --> 05:08:33,830
Can you climb up?

8597
05:08:33,910 --> 05:08:34,650
I can.

8598
05:08:36,010 --> 05:08:37,030
I'm safe for rezz.

8599
05:08:38,670 --> 05:08:39,790
Thank you.

8600
05:08:41,530 --> 05:08:42,750
There's a team underneath.

8601
05:08:43,110 --> 05:08:43,950
Try peeking us.

8602
05:08:44,230 --> 05:08:45,030
You have to fight.

8603
05:08:45,030 --> 05:08:46,310
Just hold.

8604
05:08:50,090 --> 05:08:51,350
It's a solo nuke castle.

8605
05:08:51,490 --> 05:08:52,170
You're okay.

8606
05:08:52,330 --> 05:08:52,970
I'm healing.

8607
05:08:53,510 --> 05:08:56,570
I'm going to rezz.

8608
05:08:56,610 --> 05:08:57,870
You cover that door.

8609
05:08:58,010 --> 05:08:59,390
Just shoot your Sheila.

8610
05:08:59,930 --> 05:09:01,130
They won't push in.

8611
05:09:01,550 --> 05:09:02,330
Just heal.

8612
05:09:02,950 --> 05:09:04,350
Take my shield.

8613
05:09:04,490 --> 05:09:06,710
Are you fine?

8614
05:09:07,910 --> 05:09:09,070
Just heal.

8615
05:09:09,770 --> 05:09:10,170
Healing.

8616
05:09:13,010 --> 05:09:14,950
We have to make a play here.

8617
05:09:15,010 --> 05:09:15,390
Do you have bubble?

8618
05:09:15,530 --> 05:09:16,070
Can you bubble up?

8619
05:09:16,890 --> 05:09:17,950
We just fight them.

8620
05:09:19,490 --> 05:09:20,290
Bubble up.

8621
05:09:21,990 --> 05:09:22,630
They're not here.

8622
05:09:23,310 --> 05:09:23,890
Castle on me.

8623
05:09:25,550 --> 05:09:26,070
He's one.

8624
05:09:26,530 --> 05:09:27,130
On my door.

8625
05:09:29,690 --> 05:09:29,990
Dead.

8626
05:09:31,370 --> 05:09:32,030
There's a team.

8627
05:09:32,870 --> 05:09:33,090
Zipping.

8628
05:09:34,230 --> 05:09:35,010
Above me.

8629
05:09:35,010 --> 05:09:35,390
On hype.

8630
05:09:43,990 --> 05:09:45,450
Come left with me.

8631
05:09:46,650 --> 05:09:47,050
Left.

8632
05:09:49,230 --> 05:09:49,750
It's fine.

8633
05:09:50,390 --> 05:09:52,350
They got me.

8634
05:09:52,570 --> 05:09:53,230
Come down.

8635
05:09:53,730 --> 05:09:54,570
I'm here.

8636
05:09:57,170 --> 05:09:58,430
You have to hit this climb.

8637
05:10:01,070 --> 05:10:02,050
I don't think I can make it.

8638
05:10:02,050 --> 05:10:04,150
Get on this rock and climb to me.

8639
05:10:04,210 --> 05:10:04,570
Don't panic.

8640
05:10:05,790 --> 05:10:06,670
Keep coming.

8641
05:10:08,330 --> 05:10:09,430
I got it.

8642
05:10:09,790 --> 05:10:10,610
Keep coming.

8643
05:10:14,650 --> 05:10:16,750
They're walking up to me.

8644
05:10:19,490 --> 05:10:20,390
He's right below me.

8645
05:10:21,110 --> 05:10:21,870
Just hold on me.

8646
05:10:22,350 --> 05:10:23,110
I need to heal.

8647
05:10:24,410 --> 05:10:26,490
We have to be careful of the walk up over here.

8648
05:10:27,010 --> 05:10:27,550
I'm here.

8649
05:10:29,110 --> 05:10:29,650
I'm here.

8650
05:10:31,250 --> 05:10:32,930
We just play behind my Q first.

8651
05:10:33,070 --> 05:10:35,510
You save your bubble.

8652
05:10:35,830 --> 05:10:36,390
I have bubble.

8653
05:10:37,210 --> 05:10:38,450
We can kill them.

8654
05:10:39,730 --> 05:10:41,590
I don't have an angle.

8655
05:10:41,890 --> 05:10:43,070
I don't either.

8656
05:10:43,330 --> 05:10:43,790
Climbing.

8657
05:10:45,990 --> 05:10:46,490
142.

8658
05:10:46,650 --> 05:10:49,050
Good shots.

8659
05:10:49,650 --> 05:10:51,370
I need to not touch my Q.

8660
05:10:51,610 --> 05:10:53,450
The spinning thing is crazy.

8661
05:10:55,950 --> 05:10:56,830
We need to make a play.

8662
05:10:56,830 --> 05:11:00,230
I can ult this side.

8663
05:11:00,390 --> 05:11:00,870
You want me to?

8664
05:11:01,250 --> 05:11:02,450
No, save it.

8665
05:11:04,750 --> 05:11:05,830
I'm looking climb up.

8666
05:11:07,650 --> 05:11:08,310
Horizon Q.

8667
05:11:10,030 --> 05:11:10,730
They're fighting.

8668
05:11:13,830 --> 05:11:14,530
Just heal.

8669
05:11:14,690 --> 05:11:16,250
I'll look for climb up.

8670
05:11:16,650 --> 05:11:18,450
The team under us doesn't take this Q.

8671
05:11:19,190 --> 05:11:20,170
I'm looking for us.

8672
05:11:22,090 --> 05:11:23,530
They're crafting over there too.

8673
05:11:24,850 --> 05:11:25,170
They're fighting.

8674
05:11:25,170 --> 05:11:25,490
They're fighting.

8675
05:11:30,270 --> 05:11:31,270
I'm going to nade.

8676
05:11:34,290 --> 05:11:36,150
I have a lot of nades.

8677
05:11:37,270 --> 05:11:39,030
We have to do something here.

8678
05:11:43,070 --> 05:11:43,930
Save your nades.

8679
05:11:44,410 --> 05:11:45,730
I think we have to bomb this team.

8680
05:11:46,530 --> 05:11:47,310
87 in the back.

8681
05:11:47,490 --> 05:11:47,490
Kill.

8682
05:11:50,310 --> 05:11:51,850
He's right here.

8683
05:11:52,770 --> 05:11:53,050
Cover.

8684
05:11:53,050 --> 05:11:53,490
Inside.

8685
05:11:53,910 --> 05:11:56,270
At the back.

8686
05:11:57,010 --> 05:11:58,130
Fight this.

8687
05:11:58,510 --> 05:11:59,110
I'm batting.

8688
05:11:59,930 --> 05:12:01,090
I'm here.

8689
05:12:03,650 --> 05:12:05,050
Don't jump in.

8690
05:12:05,130 --> 05:12:05,790
Stay outside.

8691
05:12:05,890 --> 05:12:06,990
I need a dome.

8692
05:12:10,290 --> 05:12:11,010
Pushing.

8693
05:12:12,970 --> 05:12:13,570
I broke it.

8694
05:12:13,690 --> 05:12:13,870
I'm fine.

8695
05:12:15,750 --> 05:12:16,910
We just chill here.

8696
05:12:16,950 --> 05:12:17,950
Play for these two kills on the left.

8697
05:12:18,850 --> 05:12:20,010
Right here.

8698
05:12:20,010 --> 05:12:20,090
We're okay.

8699
05:12:21,030 --> 05:12:22,890
Focus the left.

8700
05:12:24,350 --> 05:12:25,230
I'm waiting.

8701
05:12:25,890 --> 05:12:27,170
Pushing us.

8702
05:12:28,530 --> 05:12:29,730
Can't see them.

8703
05:12:31,130 --> 05:12:31,530
I'm timing.

8704
05:12:31,970 --> 05:12:32,210
Okay.

8705
05:12:33,950 --> 05:12:34,430
String this.

8706
05:12:35,350 --> 05:12:35,930
Get these kills.

8707
05:12:36,610 --> 05:12:37,050
I couldn't.

8708
05:12:37,830 --> 05:12:46,150
You guys did great.

8709
05:12:46,150 --> 05:12:47,770
You guys did great.

8710
05:12:47,850 --> 05:12:48,290
Awesome.

8711
05:12:48,410 --> 05:12:52,710
I literally looked at Sheila and got beamed.

8712
05:12:53,230 --> 05:12:54,410
It was so hard.

8713
05:12:54,550 --> 05:12:55,450
I couldn't do anything.

8714
05:12:56,350 --> 05:12:59,210
When he got rid of his wall, the box just disappeared.

8715
05:12:59,490 --> 05:13:00,330
That's weird.

8716
05:13:00,610 --> 05:13:02,030
I wanted to stop it and it was just gone.

8717
05:13:02,710 --> 05:13:03,210
Wow.

8718
05:13:04,110 --> 05:13:04,790
That's crazy.

8719
05:13:05,810 --> 05:13:06,370
Unfortunate.

8720
05:13:06,930 --> 05:13:08,830
How many points does that give us?

8721
05:13:10,510 --> 05:13:11,470
That's 9?

8722
05:13:12,410 --> 05:13:12,970
Or 10?

8723
05:13:12,970 --> 05:13:13,790
9.

8724
05:13:14,250 --> 05:13:16,450
We got 6th place, right?

8725
05:13:19,810 --> 05:13:21,070
Give me one second.

8726
05:13:22,710 --> 05:13:23,470
That's 9.

8727
05:13:23,790 --> 05:13:24,490
9 points.

8728
05:13:24,630 --> 05:13:24,870
Okay.

8729
05:13:26,690 --> 05:13:27,890
We have 16.

8730
05:13:28,350 --> 05:13:30,870
We just need another 10 points.

8731
05:13:31,050 --> 05:13:31,770
We should be good.

8732
05:13:32,890 --> 05:13:33,470
Alright.

8733
05:13:34,550 --> 05:13:35,850
Nice game, everybody.

8734
05:13:36,430 --> 05:13:37,130
Oh my god.

8735
05:13:40,090 --> 05:13:41,550
R9 was clutch for me.

8736
05:13:44,130 --> 05:13:45,890
I could actually do stuff.

8737
05:13:54,460 --> 05:13:56,800
That was an intense game.

8738
05:13:56,900 --> 05:13:58,180
We got really good.

8739
05:13:58,760 --> 05:14:01,220
I'm surprised we got the rotation.

8740
05:14:01,880 --> 05:14:04,120
We were just running in the open.

8741
05:14:06,860 --> 05:14:09,440
That rotation was so fucking scuffed.

8742
05:14:09,540 --> 05:14:13,460
I don't know how the fuck me and Flame made it through.

8743
05:14:14,720 --> 05:14:16,180
That was awesome.

8744
05:14:16,320 --> 05:14:18,420
We just ran there.

8745
05:14:21,240 --> 05:14:22,240
Oh my god.

8746
05:14:22,440 --> 05:14:22,980
We made it.

8747
05:14:23,000 --> 05:14:25,600
That rotation is actually what I live for.

8748
05:14:26,740 --> 05:14:27,660
Let's go.

8749
05:14:28,040 --> 05:14:29,240
Let's just run.

8750
05:14:29,500 --> 05:14:31,860
It's like running past the fucking battlefield.

8751
05:14:32,080 --> 05:14:35,260
We're storming Normandy again.

8752
05:14:36,900 --> 05:14:41,120
It's like World War 2 and we're fucking storming the beaches.

8753
05:14:44,200 --> 05:14:45,140
The beaches.

8754
05:14:45,520 --> 05:14:47,120
Here we come.

8755
05:14:49,000 --> 05:14:50,540
Oh my god.

8756
05:14:53,480 --> 05:14:55,160
Two more games, guys.

8757
05:14:55,460 --> 05:14:56,160
Two more games.

8758
05:14:56,180 --> 05:14:56,680
Two more.

8759
05:14:58,300 --> 05:15:00,320
How many points are we at?

8760
05:15:00,960 --> 05:15:02,920
7 plus 9, so 16.

8761
05:15:04,180 --> 05:15:04,560
Okay.

8762
05:15:04,860 --> 05:15:06,080
That was 9 points, right?

8763
05:15:06,980 --> 05:15:07,580
5.

8764
05:15:07,580 --> 05:15:09,380
We got what?

8765
05:15:09,600 --> 05:15:09,880
6 kills?

8766
05:15:10,780 --> 05:15:12,780
5 kills and 6 plays?

8767
05:15:13,840 --> 05:15:15,940
I'm checking the thing right now.

8768
05:15:19,000 --> 05:15:20,200
Give me one second.

8769
05:15:21,480 --> 05:15:23,620
Yeah, we are at 16 points.

8770
05:15:25,300 --> 05:15:25,740
Okay.

8771
05:15:27,420 --> 05:15:29,660
So we just need...

8772
05:15:30,800 --> 05:15:32,500
Top 10 is only at 24.

8773
05:15:32,900 --> 05:15:35,000
Cutoff is gonna look like 30.

8774
05:15:35,600 --> 05:15:36,100
Oh, 30?

8775
05:15:36,920 --> 05:15:37,680
Oh my god.

8776
05:15:38,220 --> 05:15:39,620
It's gonna be high 30.

8777
05:15:39,920 --> 05:15:42,000
Oh my god, that's the cutoff.

8778
05:15:42,660 --> 05:15:48,420
That means everybody is getting in and stuff.

8779
05:15:49,300 --> 05:15:49,480
Yeah.

8780
05:15:49,720 --> 05:15:52,000
I hesitated too much there.

8781
05:15:52,320 --> 05:15:56,480
I tried to use the horizon queue to get up to the roof but I should have just climbed it.

8782
05:15:56,960 --> 05:15:59,800
If I climbed it, they were popping literally a mobi rez.

8783
05:16:00,060 --> 05:16:02,720
I could have just You could have farmed it.

8784
05:16:02,800 --> 05:16:04,300
Actually just destroyed them.

8785
05:16:04,980 --> 05:16:05,760
Now you know.

8786
05:16:06,120 --> 05:16:15,560
We could have taken the mobi rez and that would have been 8 kills with a top 5 and we can do more from there.

8787
05:16:17,880 --> 05:16:19,860
I don't know why I didn't just climb.

8788
05:16:20,460 --> 05:16:22,640
I looked at the horizon queue There was so much stuff happening.

8789
05:16:22,740 --> 05:16:24,560
There were literally gunshots all around us.

8790
05:16:26,460 --> 05:16:28,240
I had the same idea.

8791
05:16:28,240 --> 05:16:29,600
I wanted to get to the roof.

8792
05:16:29,740 --> 05:16:34,100
I don't know why I thought I had to take the horizon queue.

8793
05:16:34,360 --> 05:16:35,360
You just saw it.

8794
05:16:35,420 --> 05:16:37,960
It was so tempting though.

8795
05:16:38,740 --> 05:16:40,980
You were just like I could take it right now.

8796
05:16:41,780 --> 05:16:46,220
When will I ever get that chance again to just take that horizon queue.

8797
05:16:46,900 --> 05:16:50,140
To be fair I think if I had 20 ping, I would have been completely fine.

8798
05:16:50,320 --> 05:16:52,180
I'm pretty sure that was another 300 ping game.

8799
05:16:52,520 --> 05:16:53,260
Wait, really?

8800
05:16:54,400 --> 05:16:55,280
Oh my god.

8801
05:16:55,280 --> 05:16:57,760
What the fuck is going on with your routing there?

8802
05:16:58,480 --> 05:16:59,420
That's crazy.

8803
05:17:00,680 --> 05:17:05,680
Yeah, Tokyo usually for me is sometimes like a 300 for no reason.

8804
05:17:05,980 --> 05:17:06,340
Yeah.

8805
05:17:06,640 --> 05:17:07,780
Just unrouting sometimes.

8806
05:17:09,120 --> 05:17:11,780
It's like the case for Korean players as well.

8807
05:17:11,960 --> 05:17:16,080
I have a friend in Korea and sometimes he just gets 350 ping.

8808
05:17:16,300 --> 05:17:16,860
Yeah, that's insane.

8809
05:17:17,700 --> 05:17:18,080
That's really weird.

8810
05:17:18,580 --> 05:17:19,640
That's crazy.

8811
05:17:19,940 --> 05:17:22,780
I guess they just swapped servers for this one.

8812
05:17:22,780 --> 05:17:24,060
Like the...

8813
05:17:24,060 --> 05:17:25,600
I don't think they did.

8814
05:17:26,400 --> 05:17:28,540
Yeah, I don't know.

8815
05:17:28,760 --> 05:17:32,820
Like the same server The winner's round is like this.

8816
05:17:34,800 --> 05:17:36,100
Some games it's not.

8817
05:17:36,460 --> 05:17:37,280
And some games it is.

8818
05:17:37,500 --> 05:17:42,560
If I play ranked in Tokyo, some games I have like 90 ping and some games I have 300.

8819
05:17:42,560 --> 05:17:43,720
That's interesting.

8820
05:17:44,680 --> 05:17:46,280
Wait, what's your ping?

8821
05:17:47,540 --> 05:17:49,120
How do you even check your ping?

8822
05:17:49,780 --> 05:17:50,300
Okay.

8823
05:17:54,420 --> 05:17:55,800
Okay, you go to settings.

8824
05:17:55,920 --> 05:17:56,800
You go to...

8825
05:17:57,720 --> 05:17:59,400
I don't even know how to do that.

8826
05:17:59,400 --> 05:18:00,120
You go to settings.

8827
05:18:00,140 --> 05:18:02,340
I've been experiencing like ping issues.

8828
05:18:02,560 --> 05:18:03,640
Like everyone is teleporting.

8829
05:18:03,800 --> 05:18:06,260
Go to settings.

8830
05:18:07,780 --> 05:18:09,940
And then you go to...

8831
05:18:09,940 --> 05:18:13,440
You scroll down until you see accessibility.

8832
05:18:14,400 --> 05:18:16,240
You scroll down and you see accessibility.

8833
05:18:16,740 --> 05:18:19,640
And then you look up and you see performance display.

8834
05:18:19,640 --> 05:18:21,140
You press on...

8835
05:18:23,120 --> 05:18:24,480
Performance display...

8836
05:18:25,460 --> 05:18:26,140
Colorblind...

8837
05:18:26,140 --> 05:18:26,680
Subtitle...

8838
05:18:26,680 --> 05:18:28,540
No, you go look up.

8839
05:18:28,660 --> 05:18:30,200
Not under accessibility.

8840
05:18:30,600 --> 05:18:31,300
You look up.

8841
05:18:32,280 --> 05:18:33,080
Oh, okay.

8842
05:18:33,380 --> 05:18:34,360
Performance display.

8843
05:18:34,940 --> 05:18:37,340
I thought it was in the...

8844
05:18:38,100 --> 05:18:39,840
That's why I said you look up.

8845
05:18:43,040 --> 05:18:49,320
I saw what happened in one of that map where we had to guide you like a rat.

8846
05:18:50,500 --> 05:18:51,780
That's so funny.

8847
05:18:52,120 --> 05:18:54,240
We were like, Jirard, that's right.

8848
05:18:54,680 --> 05:18:57,000
Follow the ping.

8849
05:18:58,360 --> 05:18:59,800
I was panicking.

8850
05:19:00,260 --> 05:19:01,920
It was so funny though.

8851
05:19:02,560 --> 05:19:04,760
I was trapped in this...

8852
05:19:04,760 --> 05:19:06,300
Yeah, you were trapped in the fucking cage.

8853
05:19:06,460 --> 05:19:09,980
And the fact that Flame gave you a medkit for a good job done.

8854
05:19:10,720 --> 05:19:12,640
Good job, Jirard.

8855
05:19:12,720 --> 05:19:13,460
He has a medkit.

8856
05:19:14,600 --> 05:19:17,360
I am directionally challenged in Apex.

8857
05:19:17,520 --> 05:19:19,340
I do not memorize anything here.

8858
05:19:19,660 --> 05:19:20,980
L, M, N, I.

8859
05:19:21,660 --> 05:19:26,720
I don't know how many hours you have in Apex, but I remember when I first started playing the game, it was just information overload.

8860
05:19:27,020 --> 05:19:29,540
Oh my god, I currently have...

8861
05:19:30,640 --> 05:19:32,300
Oh my god, this is my...

8862
05:19:32,300 --> 05:19:36,920
Okay, so this is not including my other account, but this is the one where I grinded Pred.

8863
05:19:37,100 --> 05:19:41,420
It has 918 hours for this account.

8864
05:19:41,420 --> 05:19:42,340
So...

8865
05:19:43,720 --> 05:19:45,480
That is very little.

8866
05:19:45,860 --> 05:19:49,840
Yeah, but I wasn't on this account for three years.

8867
05:19:50,480 --> 05:19:51,780
Oh my god.

8868
05:19:55,300 --> 05:19:57,220
So there's definitely more.

8869
05:19:57,440 --> 05:19:59,540
I don't know how many hours the other account has.

8870
05:19:59,980 --> 05:20:01,300
Jesus Christ, there's more?

8871
05:20:05,300 --> 05:20:09,440
Alright, it's time to lock in last two games.

8872
05:20:12,260 --> 05:20:13,520
Last two games.

8873
05:20:18,440 --> 05:20:23,160
If we get champion this game, we don't have to worry about the last game.

8874
05:20:24,600 --> 05:20:25,920
That's all I'm saying.

8875
05:20:27,120 --> 05:20:27,960
I'm throwing.

8876
05:20:29,340 --> 05:20:32,020
The endgames are a lot more like...

8877
05:20:32,020 --> 05:20:32,600
Crazy?

8878
05:20:34,340 --> 05:20:36,580
Everyone's just playing good spots.

8879
05:20:36,820 --> 05:20:37,100
Yeah.

8880
05:20:38,080 --> 05:20:41,260
Basically, like I said, it's like LGS, but VTubers.

8881
05:20:44,320 --> 05:20:45,400
It's literally that.

8882
05:20:47,500 --> 05:20:49,420
There's a team with 60 points.

8883
05:20:50,400 --> 05:20:51,600
I don't know.

8884
05:20:52,900 --> 05:20:55,260
Holy shit, what the fuck are they doing?

8885
05:20:55,460 --> 05:20:56,660
Do the same thing.

8886
05:20:58,220 --> 05:21:00,640
Remember to do the console right after.

8887
05:21:02,000 --> 05:21:03,560
Run with the house on my yellow ping.

8888
05:21:04,000 --> 05:21:04,920
Run for the console.

8889
05:21:05,200 --> 05:21:06,180
Underneath the big building.

8890
05:21:07,700 --> 05:21:08,220
Okay, okay.

8891
05:21:09,240 --> 05:21:10,900
You want to hit it as soon as possible.

8892
05:21:19,910 --> 05:21:20,310
Alright.

8893
05:21:24,040 --> 05:21:25,820
I have a 3x if you need it.

8894
05:21:26,280 --> 05:21:26,960
Do you need it?

8895
05:21:28,200 --> 05:21:28,960
Yeah, I do.

8896
05:21:29,160 --> 05:21:30,320
Can you hold on to it?

8897
05:21:31,120 --> 05:21:31,680
Thank you.

8898
05:21:33,960 --> 05:21:35,200
I don't have the...

8899
05:21:35,200 --> 05:21:35,560
Oh, I do.

8900
05:21:38,700 --> 05:21:39,360
Triple take.

8901
05:21:41,960 --> 05:21:43,100
Do you need that, Flame?

8902
05:21:44,100 --> 05:21:44,500
Yeah.

8903
05:21:45,980 --> 05:21:48,020
If you see another triple take, let me know.

8904
05:21:48,780 --> 05:21:49,560
Yeah, I will.

8905
05:21:49,740 --> 05:21:53,500
There's actually an extra 3x here, but it's far, so...

8906
05:21:53,500 --> 05:21:55,780
Yeah, I'll just bring it over there.

8907
05:22:01,520 --> 05:22:02,740
Do you need this?

8908
05:22:04,520 --> 05:22:06,460
No, I don't.

8909
05:22:07,160 --> 05:22:07,420
Okay.

8910
05:22:09,640 --> 05:22:10,880
No caches on us?

8911
05:22:11,300 --> 05:22:12,580
I can't see through the pings.

8912
05:22:12,720 --> 05:22:13,620
Is there no caches on us?

8913
05:22:14,720 --> 05:22:17,200
Nope, no caches near us, unfortunately.

8914
05:22:18,240 --> 05:22:19,640
Okay, I'll just leave.

8915
05:22:19,860 --> 05:22:21,820
Okay, we need to be there.

8916
05:22:22,660 --> 05:22:23,340
We need to go now.

8917
05:22:24,320 --> 05:22:25,200
I'm heading over now.

8918
05:22:25,280 --> 05:22:26,400
Start running towards the hill.

8919
05:22:26,900 --> 05:22:28,020
We're hitting cannon.

8920
05:22:31,080 --> 05:22:32,000
I'm heading over.

8921
05:22:33,320 --> 05:22:34,400
I have a...

8922
05:22:34,400 --> 05:22:37,140
We want to be in one of the nuts here.

8923
05:22:37,940 --> 05:22:39,280
Either that or on the hide.

8924
05:22:39,440 --> 05:22:42,140
I left my 2x, so...

8925
05:22:42,880 --> 05:22:44,220
You're the only one with a scope for now.

8926
05:22:45,180 --> 05:22:45,620
That's fine.

8927
05:22:45,700 --> 05:22:46,740
I have a 1x to 2x.

8928
05:22:46,840 --> 05:22:49,400
I can give you for the 3x if you have it.

8929
05:22:49,940 --> 05:22:50,540
I have a 1x.

8930
05:22:50,580 --> 05:22:51,000
You want it?

8931
05:22:51,420 --> 05:22:51,900
No, it's fine.

8932
05:22:51,920 --> 05:22:52,660
I'll take his 1x or 2x.

8933
05:22:52,880 --> 05:22:53,800
We just leave first.

8934
05:22:53,900 --> 05:22:54,620
We just have to go first.

8935
05:22:57,700 --> 05:22:57,980
Run...

8936
05:22:59,160 --> 05:22:59,440
Here.

8937
05:23:02,180 --> 05:23:05,060
We need to go right here.

8938
05:23:11,250 --> 05:23:11,570
Don't loot.

8939
05:23:11,690 --> 05:23:11,910
Don't loot.

8940
05:23:12,010 --> 05:23:12,370
Just keep running.

8941
05:23:14,310 --> 05:23:14,870
No looting.

8942
05:23:14,870 --> 05:23:16,310
We need to go super, super fast.

8943
05:23:16,890 --> 05:23:17,890
Going, going, going.

8944
05:23:20,230 --> 05:23:21,190
Can we hit this blue bin?

8945
05:23:21,850 --> 05:23:23,170
Yeah, I can hit it.

8946
05:23:23,630 --> 05:23:24,010
I'll hit it.

8947
05:23:24,490 --> 05:23:25,170
Or you hit it.

8948
05:23:25,210 --> 05:23:26,090
Your support too.

8949
05:23:28,550 --> 05:23:28,990
Just keep going.

8950
05:23:31,050 --> 05:23:32,030
No looting, no looting.

8951
05:23:32,750 --> 05:23:33,890
We have to get to this right nut.

8952
05:23:34,890 --> 05:23:35,530
Uh oh.

8953
05:23:36,850 --> 05:23:38,410
I'm going to shoot a cell behind and then I'll go.

8954
05:23:40,090 --> 05:23:41,590
I can throw a bubble to him in a minute.

8955
05:23:42,650 --> 05:23:43,230
Bubble into me.

8956
05:23:45,350 --> 05:23:46,110
It's a solo.

8957
05:23:46,250 --> 05:23:46,910
I think it's a solo.

8958
05:23:47,010 --> 05:23:47,930
I got the bubble.

8959
05:23:48,270 --> 05:23:48,670
He ran off.

8960
05:23:49,450 --> 05:23:50,330
Did he?

8961
05:23:51,310 --> 05:23:52,190
They ran.

8962
05:23:55,170 --> 05:23:56,310
There's an energy here.

8963
05:23:57,350 --> 05:23:57,650
Yeah.

8964
05:23:58,950 --> 05:24:00,390
I'm going to hit that cache outside.

8965
05:24:00,990 --> 05:24:01,630
Can you come with me?

8966
05:24:03,570 --> 05:24:04,450
Start walling.

8967
05:24:04,530 --> 05:24:05,230
Start walling again.

8968
05:24:06,390 --> 05:24:08,570
Get walls outside here on major road if you can.

8969
05:24:09,890 --> 05:24:10,330
Careful.

8970
05:24:11,350 --> 05:24:12,010
What's your bubble at?

8971
05:24:12,010 --> 05:24:13,470
I have 3 seconds.

8972
05:24:14,170 --> 05:24:15,350
I'm going now.

8973
05:24:15,690 --> 05:24:17,070
Wait until you need it.

8974
05:24:18,750 --> 05:24:19,870
I'll let you know if I need it.

8975
05:24:21,050 --> 05:24:22,290
We'll heal first, Gerard.

8976
05:24:22,410 --> 05:24:22,910
Don't risk dying.

8977
05:24:22,990 --> 05:24:23,650
If you die, we can push.

8978
05:24:27,650 --> 05:24:28,910
We can't move anymore.

8979
05:24:29,050 --> 05:24:31,490
They took this door so we don't have this door.

8980
05:24:32,890 --> 05:24:33,430
Yeah, it's fine.

8981
05:24:34,590 --> 05:24:35,050
Do you need shields?

8982
05:24:35,290 --> 05:24:36,410
Do you not have heals?

8983
05:24:37,190 --> 05:24:37,970
I'll give them to you.

8984
05:24:37,970 --> 05:24:39,110
I'll give them to you.

8985
05:24:40,730 --> 05:24:41,130
Just...

8986
05:24:42,670 --> 05:24:44,050
Don't heal, Gerard.

8987
05:24:44,190 --> 05:24:44,830
No, no, no.

8988
05:24:47,650 --> 05:24:48,690
It's okay, really.

8989
05:24:49,470 --> 05:24:50,970
Just take these bats for now.

8990
05:24:52,510 --> 05:24:54,590
I think you mostly want to use bats.

8991
05:24:54,730 --> 05:24:56,050
Yeah, you just want to use bats because you're...

8992
05:24:57,130 --> 05:25:00,390
I can give you one more shield cell but heal that pull up.

8993
05:25:01,890 --> 05:25:04,970
We want to use the cells so we let Gerard use the...

8994
05:25:04,970 --> 05:25:05,350
Okay.

8995
05:25:05,350 --> 05:25:05,570
Okay.

8996
05:25:07,570 --> 05:25:08,530
He should...

8997
05:25:08,530 --> 05:25:10,890
So I should be using bats or cells?

8998
05:25:11,050 --> 05:25:12,130
It depends.

8999
05:25:12,310 --> 05:25:14,910
It depends on how much health you have.

9000
05:25:15,770 --> 05:25:18,890
Come out to me and start getting rampart covers down.

9001
05:25:21,170 --> 05:25:22,130
Team Godrock.

9002
05:25:24,790 --> 05:25:26,070
There's a car behind us.

9003
05:25:26,090 --> 05:25:27,390
There's a car right here.

9004
05:25:27,930 --> 05:25:30,970
Wait, is that their car?

9005
05:25:31,310 --> 05:25:31,890
Yeah, it's their car.

9006
05:25:35,350 --> 05:25:36,390
You want to set up a shield over there?

9007
05:25:37,010 --> 05:25:39,470
No, just get rampart covers here on the right.

9008
05:25:41,370 --> 05:25:42,470
How many cells do we have?

9009
05:25:42,930 --> 05:25:43,630
I have six cells.

9010
05:25:44,270 --> 05:25:47,070
I have six cells, one bat.

9011
05:25:47,610 --> 05:25:48,870
Oh, here's a purple mag.

9012
05:25:48,970 --> 05:25:49,710
I have a purple mag.

9013
05:25:51,890 --> 05:25:53,830
How many cells do you have, Gerard?

9014
05:25:54,190 --> 05:25:55,230
I have one.

9015
05:25:55,910 --> 05:25:56,170
Okay.

9016
05:25:57,450 --> 05:25:58,470
I'm four, eight.

9017
05:25:58,810 --> 05:25:59,850
How many bats do you have, Gerard?

9018
05:26:01,530 --> 05:26:01,930
One.

9019
05:26:02,470 --> 05:26:03,510
Oh my God, Gerard.

9020
05:26:03,690 --> 05:26:04,610
Do you loot heals?

9021
05:26:05,470 --> 05:26:05,890
No.

9022
05:26:06,490 --> 05:26:08,250
I need to watch your bot after this.

9023
05:26:08,330 --> 05:26:08,810
I do.

9024
05:26:09,190 --> 05:26:14,250
You said we need to run.

9025
05:26:14,310 --> 05:26:14,790
I ran.

9026
05:26:14,970 --> 05:26:16,270
I got everything that I needed.

9027
05:26:18,270 --> 05:26:20,910
Gerard, I'm sorry, but I do not believe you right now.

9028
05:26:21,210 --> 05:26:21,610
What?

9029
05:26:21,950 --> 05:26:22,350
I do.

9030
05:26:22,350 --> 05:26:25,870
I've never heard anyone leave Ceto Station with that little loot, brother.

9031
05:26:26,490 --> 05:26:27,110
Literally, never.

9032
05:26:28,910 --> 05:26:30,390
On us, on us.

9033
05:26:30,390 --> 05:26:31,410
We're getting locked up.

9034
05:26:31,450 --> 05:26:32,510
Oh my God.

9035
05:26:32,570 --> 05:26:35,410
I couldn't pay attention.

9036
05:26:36,450 --> 05:26:38,030
I was laughing.

9037
05:26:39,350 --> 05:26:40,170
With me, Gerard.

9038
05:26:40,890 --> 05:26:41,470
One HP, Castle.

9039
05:26:42,170 --> 05:26:43,130
Okay, okay, okay.

9040
05:26:46,110 --> 05:26:48,410
I don't even know where we got locked from.

9041
05:26:48,950 --> 05:26:49,230
No!

9042
05:26:50,950 --> 05:26:52,330
I'm so sorry.

9043
05:26:52,910 --> 05:26:53,630
I wasn't locked in.

9044
05:26:54,230 --> 05:26:56,770
Oh my God, I wasn't locked in.

9045
05:26:56,770 --> 05:26:59,350
I laughed at this.

9046
05:26:59,350 --> 05:27:00,830
No, I'm so sorry.

9047
05:27:00,990 --> 05:27:03,010
The Gibraltar slid in.

9048
05:27:03,970 --> 05:27:05,090
That is tough.

9049
05:27:06,190 --> 05:27:08,030
Did they break our door with Rampart?

9050
05:27:08,190 --> 05:27:08,610
I don't know.

9051
05:27:08,670 --> 05:27:10,290
There was no roll for that door.

9052
05:27:10,650 --> 05:27:13,070
For that specific door when I walked up.

9053
05:27:13,190 --> 05:27:14,830
Because, like, he was...

9054
05:27:14,830 --> 05:27:16,270
Gerard was waiting for his cooldown.

9055
05:27:17,670 --> 05:27:19,350
He was waiting for his fucking...

9056
05:27:19,350 --> 05:27:20,890
Bro, why did they do that?

9057
05:27:20,990 --> 05:27:22,470
They died for it.

9058
05:27:23,830 --> 05:27:25,050
Yeah, that's tough.

9059
05:27:25,050 --> 05:27:26,910
Why did they do that?

9060
05:27:27,390 --> 05:27:29,390
We just need one really good game, guys.

9061
05:27:29,690 --> 05:27:29,990
laughing.

9062
05:27:30,670 --> 05:27:33,830
Just one more, and we have literally one more chance.

9063
05:27:33,830 --> 05:27:34,610
We just need a 20 point game, guys.

9064
05:27:34,830 --> 05:27:36,170
We just need a 20 point game.

9065
05:27:36,210 --> 05:27:37,730
We'll win with 8 kills.

9066
05:27:38,310 --> 05:27:41,270
Hey, we managed to get 11 kills on those other ones.

9067
05:27:42,650 --> 05:27:45,450
We just need one really good game.

9068
05:27:46,290 --> 05:27:46,690
laughing.

9069
05:27:47,830 --> 05:27:50,850
We let our guard down for one second.

9070
05:27:51,390 --> 05:27:52,290
That's crazy.

9071
05:27:52,290 --> 05:27:54,450
Why does that always...

9072
05:27:54,450 --> 05:27:58,250
We let our guard down for one second and that's when they appear.

9073
05:28:01,150 --> 05:28:02,270
Every time.

9074
05:28:02,710 --> 05:28:05,270
We died because of it.

9075
05:28:07,030 --> 05:28:08,130
That's crazy.

9076
05:28:08,410 --> 05:28:10,570
Alright guys, free up your schedule for tomorrow.

9077
05:28:10,930 --> 05:28:12,550
I can't wait to see you guys again.

9078
05:28:13,850 --> 05:28:14,070
laughing.

9079
05:28:14,190 --> 05:28:16,030
Oh, I have to...

9080
05:28:16,030 --> 05:28:18,690
I've had to do so much rescheduling already, man.

9081
05:28:18,990 --> 05:28:19,390
laughing.

9082
05:28:19,390 --> 05:28:19,510
Oh no.

9083
05:28:21,650 --> 05:28:23,570
Wait, I gave you the...

9084
05:28:23,570 --> 05:28:25,510
Okay, I gave you the fucking...

9085
05:28:26,150 --> 05:28:29,310
The server that had all the information.

9086
05:28:29,630 --> 05:28:30,990
And it's all in Japanese!

9087
05:28:31,770 --> 05:28:32,350
laughing.

9088
05:28:34,350 --> 05:28:38,470
Oh my god, he actually gets the res after the shit he pulled?

9089
05:28:39,530 --> 05:28:40,030
Yeah.

9090
05:28:40,930 --> 05:28:43,170
It's just crazy.

9091
05:28:44,710 --> 05:28:46,110
It's actually crazy.

9092
05:28:48,090 --> 05:28:53,590
Oh my god, they like griefed us so hard just for that to happen.

9093
05:28:53,810 --> 05:28:56,270
Oh guys, I think we actually died 20th place.

9094
05:28:56,350 --> 05:28:56,950
laughing.

9095
05:28:58,310 --> 05:28:59,510
We were last!

9096
05:29:00,570 --> 05:29:02,590
After a very long time.

9097
05:29:03,370 --> 05:29:10,690
We hit our high during like the first bracket and now we're back to the lows.

9098
05:29:11,610 --> 05:29:12,290
laughing.

9099
05:29:14,190 --> 05:29:17,090
We hit the highs and now we're at our lows.

9100
05:29:17,970 --> 05:29:21,130
We literally have just one more chance, like last chance.

9101
05:29:21,270 --> 05:29:24,050
The next game is our last game.

9102
05:29:24,130 --> 05:29:24,850
Okay, Jiraiya.

9103
05:29:25,330 --> 05:29:27,390
How good are we supposed to be?

9104
05:29:27,630 --> 05:29:35,310
Okay, Jiraiya, to be fair I think the elimination bracket is not as difficult as this because this is literally a top 10 from each bracket.

9105
05:29:36,170 --> 05:29:46,310
So like, those who lost this one will have to fight the will have to fight the teams who won the first elimination.

9106
05:29:46,730 --> 05:29:48,190
It's literally like ALGS.

9107
05:29:48,790 --> 05:29:50,050
Wait, wait, wait.

9108
05:29:50,870 --> 05:29:53,990
Are you sure we're playing at that time?

9109
05:29:54,330 --> 05:29:59,930
I think that's why it starts so late because they're doing the first elimination first.

9110
05:30:01,190 --> 05:30:07,390
So it's like actual ALGS where we fight the winners of the first elimination.

9111
05:30:08,330 --> 05:30:08,950
Yeah, yeah.

9112
05:30:09,130 --> 05:30:13,050
We already beat them before so like maybe it'll be different.

9113
05:30:13,170 --> 05:30:13,550
I don't know.

9114
05:30:14,130 --> 05:30:14,850
Okay, yeah, no.

9115
05:30:14,970 --> 05:30:16,430
It is a limited, yeah.

9116
05:30:16,810 --> 05:30:18,250
It should be fine.

9117
05:30:18,490 --> 05:30:25,770
But then we also have the people, bottom 10 from here too, so like that's where it's harder because the bottom 10 here will be in our lobby.

9118
05:30:28,410 --> 05:30:35,450
So we're at the part where they stormed our house while I was laughing.

9119
05:30:36,930 --> 05:30:38,830
They're like the killer joke.

9120
05:30:39,390 --> 05:30:39,950
Alright.

9121
05:30:42,310 --> 05:30:44,090
Jeez, what made you laugh?

9122
05:30:44,750 --> 05:30:49,390
Because when he was like I need to VOD review you I...

9123
05:30:49,390 --> 05:30:58,050
That part, okay genuinely when I heard like we need to go I immediately like shifted gears and just started running.

9124
05:30:58,290 --> 05:31:00,670
Okay, this is our loot heals.

9125
05:31:01,370 --> 05:31:03,570
We can't keep feeding you heals.

9126
05:31:03,990 --> 05:31:06,270
We need our own heals.

9127
05:31:07,250 --> 05:31:08,370
Don't look at the screen.

9128
05:31:08,370 --> 05:31:09,650
It's fine.

9129
05:31:10,110 --> 05:31:11,690
We're VOD reviewing this.

9130
05:31:12,030 --> 05:31:15,130
After this game we're gonna VOD review for 10 minutes.

9131
05:31:15,130 --> 05:31:16,110
Don't look at the screen.

9132
05:31:18,110 --> 05:31:21,110
You are under judgment right now.

9133
05:31:22,030 --> 05:31:23,670
Sure, go ahead, go look at it.

9134
05:31:23,710 --> 05:31:27,410
But when I heard it I immediately like okay I need to go.

9135
05:31:27,750 --> 05:31:31,330
It's fine that you went, but like how do you not have heals?

9136
05:31:31,910 --> 05:31:37,870
I was looking at the places of where the map was telling me and I was getting stuff.

9137
05:31:38,090 --> 05:31:41,130
Right after this game it's VOD review time.

9138
05:31:41,890 --> 05:31:45,490
VOD review and you're just pointing out like what I did wrong.

9139
05:31:45,590 --> 05:31:47,430
That's what VOD review is!

9140
05:31:47,770 --> 05:31:50,390
That is what VOD reviewing literally is.

9141
05:31:50,470 --> 05:31:50,770
Why?

9142
05:31:51,330 --> 05:31:53,930
So you're getting two!

9143
05:31:54,430 --> 05:31:55,830
Please tell me you got this.

9144
05:31:56,210 --> 05:31:57,370
Please tell me you got this.

9145
05:32:01,610 --> 05:32:04,590
It's like what do you want it to be like?

9146
05:32:04,590 --> 05:32:06,670
Come on!

9147
05:32:12,590 --> 05:32:13,690
I am so sorry.

9148
05:32:14,410 --> 05:32:15,770
Yes, okay.

9149
05:32:16,230 --> 05:32:16,970
I get it.

9150
05:32:17,170 --> 05:32:19,490
I will get me some healies.

9151
05:32:19,550 --> 05:32:21,350
Wait, you can actually rewind his stream?

9152
05:32:21,490 --> 05:32:23,930
Oh, you're actually doing his VOD review right now?

9153
05:32:23,930 --> 05:32:24,530
Yes!

9154
05:32:25,490 --> 05:32:27,230
I'm streaming it!

9155
05:32:27,830 --> 05:32:28,870
Oh my god!

9156
05:32:30,290 --> 05:32:34,070
While we're waiting for this game to end It's time to VOD review!

9157
05:32:34,710 --> 05:32:35,890
He's streaming it!

9158
05:32:37,330 --> 05:32:38,530
Look at your stream!

9159
05:32:38,530 --> 05:32:41,210
Oh god, the embarrassment is right here.

9160
05:32:41,470 --> 05:32:42,750
He's VOD reviewing.

9161
05:32:43,050 --> 05:32:43,870
He's literally checking.

9162
05:32:44,030 --> 05:32:45,930
Holy fuck!

9163
05:32:46,030 --> 05:32:49,110
You have to wait.

9164
05:32:49,330 --> 05:32:49,850
There we go.

9165
05:32:49,970 --> 05:32:50,510
I turned it off.

9166
05:32:51,110 --> 05:32:51,390
Fuck you.

9167
05:32:52,070 --> 05:32:52,910
It's over.

9168
05:32:54,090 --> 05:32:54,650
Fuck you.

9169
05:32:55,050 --> 05:32:57,750
On one bed and six cells.

9170
05:32:59,250 --> 05:33:01,190
One bed and six cells.

9171
05:33:01,190 --> 05:33:05,650
Shut the fuck up!

9172
05:33:07,350 --> 05:33:14,030
I was wondering why we get to the place and he's just like I'm 1-0 guys.

9173
05:33:14,050 --> 05:33:15,350
I'm 0-0.

9174
05:33:16,030 --> 05:33:17,850
I have no cells.

9175
05:33:18,030 --> 05:33:18,770
I have no heals.

9176
05:33:19,050 --> 05:33:20,070
You want a syringe?

9177
05:33:23,690 --> 05:33:26,310
Okay, alright.

9178
05:33:26,670 --> 05:33:30,510
I didn't think I'd be VOD reviewed God damn it!

9179
05:33:30,510 --> 05:33:32,890
I should have turned off the fucking DVR.

9180
05:33:40,410 --> 05:33:48,590
God damn it.

9181
05:33:48,670 --> 05:33:50,770
God wasn't on my side today.

9182
05:33:52,490 --> 05:33:54,110
There's no God here.

9183
05:33:55,070 --> 05:33:56,530
It's just you.

9184
05:33:56,530 --> 05:33:58,730
It's just you.

9185
05:33:59,290 --> 05:34:08,410
Everybody like I want you guys to clip just counter I want you guys to make a counter of how many cells that I've missed throughout my entire run.

9186
05:34:09,450 --> 05:34:16,710
Like oh my god I missed like probably a hundred fucking cells and I did not even bother to pick him up.

9187
05:34:17,110 --> 05:34:17,610
Jesus.

9188
05:34:18,690 --> 05:34:19,830
You're hurting him.

9189
05:34:20,230 --> 05:34:22,390
You're fucking hurting him right now.

9190
05:34:22,390 --> 05:34:24,470
Holy shit!

9191
05:34:25,370 --> 05:34:27,310
What the fuck is this guy's house?

9192
05:34:28,370 --> 05:34:31,130
It's literally just filled with this.

9193
05:34:31,310 --> 05:34:31,930
What is that?

9194
05:34:32,390 --> 05:34:34,930
This is where all your bats and shield cells went to.

9195
05:34:36,410 --> 05:34:38,570
Oh, where's all these cells?

9196
05:34:38,770 --> 05:34:40,030
Where did all these cells go?

9197
05:34:41,810 --> 05:34:44,110
I'm not watching the same team you guys are.

9198
05:34:44,230 --> 05:34:45,090
Oh, you're not?

9199
05:34:45,210 --> 05:34:47,410
Okay, open up.

9200
05:34:47,670 --> 05:34:51,830
Wait three minutes and then open up my stream.

9201
05:34:53,490 --> 05:34:59,370
Dude, like Fuse, Gibraltar and like Newcastle are like dancing on these top cells.

9202
05:35:00,370 --> 05:35:01,570
That's crazy.

9203
05:35:02,530 --> 05:35:04,450
There's no way that's end zone.

9204
05:35:04,710 --> 05:35:06,070
Where the fuck did they pick them up?

9205
05:35:06,130 --> 05:35:06,650
From mice?

9206
05:35:07,010 --> 05:35:07,130
What?

9207
05:35:07,630 --> 05:35:09,330
No, they killed this house.

9208
05:35:10,110 --> 05:35:12,710
This house had so many people die.

9209
05:35:13,030 --> 05:35:15,290
And then they rotate after.

9210
05:35:15,950 --> 05:35:16,070
Really?

9211
05:35:16,950 --> 05:35:19,270
It just piled up.

9212
05:35:19,270 --> 05:35:22,330
Oh my god, they have like an entire stockpile down there.

9213
05:35:22,490 --> 05:35:25,710
In three minutes, get ready to see what we saw.

9214
05:35:29,230 --> 05:35:32,490
Okay, I gotta private this bot.

9215
05:35:32,530 --> 05:35:39,810
I gotta trim out the parts where I actually like Every single time I like failed to pick up the loot.

9216
05:35:39,990 --> 05:35:41,650
Yeah, I'm just gonna trim it out.

9217
05:35:42,110 --> 05:35:43,690
That's like every game.

9218
05:35:46,390 --> 05:35:47,910
You don't know that!

9219
05:35:48,210 --> 05:35:49,230
You don't know that!

9220
05:35:49,250 --> 05:35:58,750
We literally asked you about your heal situation every time and then we're always so surprised.

9221
05:35:58,870 --> 05:36:00,910
We're like, how do you have so little meds?

9222
05:36:03,310 --> 05:36:05,630
Cause we always have to feed you dry.

9223
05:36:05,990 --> 05:36:07,970
I gotta bring out my first time card.

9224
05:36:08,090 --> 05:36:08,970
First time!

9225
05:36:09,330 --> 05:36:10,110
First time!

9226
05:36:10,230 --> 05:36:13,870
To be fair, we made it this far with you as your first time.

9227
05:36:14,430 --> 05:36:15,650
Don't give me that shit!

9228
05:36:15,830 --> 05:36:16,970
It was 100% my fault!

9229
05:36:17,670 --> 05:36:18,670
Shut the fuck up!

9230
05:36:18,710 --> 05:36:19,490
It was all my fault!

9231
05:36:20,030 --> 05:36:21,790
Okay, this time for real.

9232
05:36:23,070 --> 05:36:25,730
Flame, Flame, you gotta look at my bot now.

9233
05:36:25,850 --> 05:36:28,170
I think you're gonna be able to see what I saw.

9234
05:36:28,810 --> 05:36:29,970
It's like a bunch.

9235
05:36:32,350 --> 05:36:38,310
When they're at the place where there's a million shields and everything, it's actually crazy.

9236
05:36:38,790 --> 05:36:42,850
I think we're at the part where you're getting VOD reviewed.

9237
05:36:43,130 --> 05:36:45,670
Chaz, look at the part where you're getting VOD reviewed right now.

9238
05:36:53,970 --> 05:36:57,410
I can see them reacting to the VOD review.

9239
05:36:58,450 --> 05:37:01,270
I see it being private and live.

9240
05:37:05,910 --> 05:37:08,250
Is this why I can't watch your VOD?

9241
05:37:08,250 --> 05:37:09,650
Have you paused this?

9242
05:37:10,390 --> 05:37:12,470
So people won't rewind.

9243
05:37:13,670 --> 05:37:18,190
So if something happens, people won't rewind.

9244
05:37:20,390 --> 05:37:22,110
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9245
05:37:22,870 --> 05:37:24,410
I know, I know, I know.

9246
05:37:24,650 --> 05:37:25,510
It's part of my journey.

9247
05:37:30,390 --> 05:37:32,670
I'm learning now, I'm learning now.

9248
05:37:32,790 --> 05:37:34,750
We're learning from our mistakes, it doesn't matter.

9249
05:37:34,750 --> 05:37:36,470
He keeps 400 ammo.

9250
05:37:36,750 --> 05:37:37,770
That's like the thing.

9251
05:37:38,650 --> 05:37:39,890
Per gun.

9252
05:37:46,790 --> 05:37:49,810
Do you see the house?

9253
05:37:50,390 --> 05:37:51,130
I'm watching.

9254
05:37:53,330 --> 05:37:55,150
I think you needed this, Duran.

9255
05:37:55,810 --> 05:37:58,090
Yeah, I needed all of that.

9256
05:38:01,430 --> 05:38:04,310
That's basically what you should have.

9257
05:38:07,750 --> 05:38:11,830
I'm afraid of looking into your VODs and how many batteries you guys have.

9258
05:38:11,850 --> 05:38:14,810
I usually carry 4-6.

9259
05:38:16,670 --> 05:38:20,090
2-3 max is just my shield battery cells.

9260
05:38:20,090 --> 05:38:24,710
I take 4-6 bats and 8 minimum shield cells.

9261
05:38:25,590 --> 05:38:27,850
How many shield cells should I have and how many bats?

9262
05:38:28,490 --> 05:38:31,890
So I can make some economy in my inventory or something.

9263
05:38:31,890 --> 05:38:33,910
He's taking your criticism now.

9264
05:38:34,010 --> 05:38:35,390
He wants to get VOD reviewed.

9265
05:38:36,470 --> 05:38:40,630
Now you want to get VOD reviewed after you private your VOD.

9266
05:38:43,750 --> 05:38:45,030
I'm gonna turn it back on.

9267
05:38:45,250 --> 05:38:46,570
No, I'm not gonna turn it back on.

9268
05:38:48,610 --> 05:38:51,230
Listen, we only have one more chance.

9269
05:38:52,950 --> 05:38:54,750
And we gotta do good and I'm gonna learn from that.

9270
05:38:55,050 --> 05:38:58,550
So how many should he have in his inventory?

9271
05:38:59,270 --> 05:39:00,630
How many should I have?

9272
05:39:01,970 --> 05:39:03,750
Cells and batteries.

9273
05:39:04,830 --> 05:39:07,050
As much as you can carry.

9274
05:39:07,430 --> 05:39:08,550
As much as I can?

9275
05:39:08,690 --> 05:39:08,890
Okay.

9276
05:39:11,750 --> 05:39:15,590
It depends depending on what backpack you have.

9277
05:39:15,870 --> 05:39:19,090
I run 2 bats, 8 cells.

9278
05:39:20,290 --> 05:39:22,150
That's about the bare minimum.

9279
05:39:22,910 --> 05:39:24,570
4 cells is okay.

9280
05:39:25,050 --> 05:39:28,030
Anything more and it's just kind of nice.

9281
05:39:30,010 --> 05:39:33,450
You don't need 400 ammo for one gun.

9282
05:39:33,490 --> 05:39:35,550
I thought that was the requirement.

9283
05:39:35,770 --> 05:39:37,690
200 is fine for your gun.

9284
05:39:37,810 --> 05:39:39,450
200 is fine for your gun.

9285
05:39:39,670 --> 05:39:40,510
That's the requirement.

9286
05:39:41,330 --> 05:39:43,410
So you can have more space for meds.

9287
05:39:43,850 --> 05:39:49,990
Honestly, it's a little fun to have 400 ammo if you're willing to give us the ammo if we need it.

9288
05:39:50,070 --> 05:39:54,410
But other than that if you want to be the ammo carrier That was my idea!

9289
05:39:54,730 --> 05:39:56,590
I was picking up ammo for all of you.

9290
05:39:56,650 --> 05:40:00,590
But then you gotta make sure that we run the same ammo type.

9291
05:40:03,050 --> 05:40:08,030
Because it will be very useless if it's not the same ammo.

9292
05:40:08,450 --> 05:40:09,210
Oh yeah, you're right.

9293
05:40:09,790 --> 05:40:10,270
Alright.

9294
05:40:11,630 --> 05:40:13,090
VOD review was actually useful.

9295
05:40:13,270 --> 05:40:14,050
Okay, now I know.

9296
05:40:15,170 --> 05:40:17,150
That's why we're gonna win the next one.

9297
05:40:17,410 --> 05:40:18,870
Yeah, we're gonna win the next one.

9298
05:40:18,950 --> 05:40:20,190
And then we're gonna win tomorrow.

9299
05:40:20,190 --> 05:40:21,230
Or not.

9300
05:40:21,290 --> 05:40:22,170
No, no, no!

9301
05:40:22,250 --> 05:40:22,490
Tomorrow!

9302
05:40:22,710 --> 05:40:23,570
We're gonna make it.

9303
05:40:25,010 --> 05:40:26,330
Now we are!

9304
05:40:28,050 --> 05:40:28,990
We're gonna win!

9305
05:40:30,510 --> 05:40:35,750
I'm watching the last two teams fight and these guys know what they're doing.

9306
05:40:38,890 --> 05:40:42,250
These guys know what they're fucking doing.

9307
05:40:44,850 --> 05:40:46,110
Well, we do too.

9308
05:40:46,430 --> 05:40:46,870
Now we know.

9309
05:40:46,870 --> 05:40:47,570
Now I know.

9310
05:40:48,090 --> 05:40:48,690
Woah!

9311
05:40:50,490 --> 05:40:51,990
Oh my god!

9312
05:40:52,130 --> 05:40:53,990
Oh no, down!

9313
05:40:54,690 --> 05:40:58,530
I mean, it's usually a team that fights first dies.

9314
05:41:00,130 --> 05:41:00,870
Oh yeah.

9315
05:41:01,170 --> 05:41:01,490
For real.

9316
05:41:03,450 --> 05:41:04,050
Yippee!

9317
05:41:04,550 --> 05:41:05,270
Last game!

9318
05:41:08,070 --> 05:41:08,950
Last game!

9319
05:41:09,290 --> 05:41:10,750
Last game!

9320
05:41:10,950 --> 05:41:12,410
It's a make it or break it!

9321
05:41:13,650 --> 05:41:15,190
Alright, let's go guys.

9322
05:41:23,640 --> 05:41:27,400
Hey, someone's watching TV, what the fuck?

9323
05:41:28,520 --> 05:41:30,320
Get more water, I'll be right back guys.

9324
05:41:31,580 --> 05:41:31,840
I think?

9325
05:41:32,500 --> 05:41:34,240
I'll be right back, I gotta get water.

9326
05:41:35,000 --> 05:41:35,800
I gotta pee.

9327
05:41:35,980 --> 05:41:37,180
I've been holding this thing forever.

9328
05:41:37,340 --> 05:41:38,060
Okay, be right back.

9329
05:41:43,280 --> 05:41:46,860
Alright, now it's just me and both of their viewers.

9330
05:41:48,060 --> 05:41:48,620
Hello everyone.

9331
05:41:51,700 --> 05:41:52,260
That's it.

9332
05:41:52,440 --> 05:41:53,300
That's all I wanted to say.

9333
05:41:53,300 --> 05:41:53,560
Okay.

9334
05:42:24,820 --> 05:42:25,900
Alright, I'm back.

9335
05:42:26,840 --> 05:42:28,740
Are you guys pumped up for the last game?

9336
05:42:31,360 --> 05:42:31,840
Hello?

9337
05:42:32,640 --> 05:42:33,400
Hello, hello.

9338
05:42:33,820 --> 05:42:35,300
He's gonna take a piss.

9339
05:42:36,860 --> 05:42:40,500
I am not excited for this last game, I can't lie to you.

9340
05:42:40,800 --> 05:42:41,460
Wait, why?

9341
05:42:45,800 --> 05:42:48,340
This just could not have come at a worse timing.

9342
05:42:48,760 --> 05:42:59,540
Because we're asking for help from someone and like, I've had to reschedule a VOD review session that was supposed to happen like a few hours ago.

9343
05:42:59,540 --> 05:43:00,360
Oh no!

9344
05:43:02,100 --> 05:43:02,620
Right?

9345
05:43:03,020 --> 05:43:06,120
And then I told him let's do tomorrow at the same time.

9346
05:43:08,040 --> 05:43:10,340
Unfortunately, we don't make it.

9347
05:43:10,780 --> 05:43:16,020
But it's a different time, because like oh, but the same time is when we start the game.

9348
05:43:16,260 --> 05:43:21,720
Yes, the VOD review is set for 8pm SGT and we start at 6pm.

9349
05:43:21,900 --> 05:43:22,640
That's awkward.

9350
05:43:24,520 --> 05:43:26,040
That's so awkward.

9351
05:43:26,240 --> 05:43:28,460
I'm gonna have to ask him to reschedule again.

9352
05:43:28,900 --> 05:43:32,140
Sorry, I didn't realize we didn't make it too.

9353
05:43:32,620 --> 05:43:34,200
No, we didn't make it.

9354
05:43:34,280 --> 05:43:36,120
So we gotta play it next day.

9355
05:43:36,960 --> 05:43:37,820
Wait, what happened?

9356
05:43:39,360 --> 05:43:40,480
You didn't make it?

9357
05:43:40,600 --> 05:43:46,000
Wait, okay, I'll write the message to him and then you can copy and paste it.

9358
05:43:47,660 --> 05:43:48,500
Your responsibility.

9359
05:43:50,920 --> 05:43:54,620
And then you screenshot my message.

9360
05:43:55,460 --> 05:43:56,800
Okay, what's his name?

9361
05:43:57,100 --> 05:43:57,620
I'll write it.

9362
05:43:58,000 --> 05:43:59,380
I'll be like, hey...

9363
05:43:59,380 --> 05:44:01,380
His name is Balvarin.

9364
05:44:01,700 --> 05:44:02,960
Okay, okay.

9365
05:44:04,280 --> 05:44:05,260
Thank you, thank you.

9366
05:44:05,320 --> 05:44:05,860
I appreciate it.

9367
05:44:06,220 --> 05:44:07,080
Hey, Balvarin.

9368
05:44:07,240 --> 05:44:08,140
Sorry, man.

9369
05:44:10,260 --> 05:44:11,740
I fucked up, bro.

9370
05:44:17,640 --> 05:44:18,700
Oh, God.

9371
05:44:18,860 --> 05:44:20,340
You're gonna have to make room, man.

9372
05:44:20,820 --> 05:44:23,860
So we have to play an extra day.

9373
05:44:25,720 --> 05:44:27,760
And we need it more.

9374
05:44:37,350 --> 05:44:38,410
Okay, we're here.

9375
05:44:38,410 --> 05:44:38,590
There we go.

9376
05:44:41,970 --> 05:44:42,850
Hey, Balvarin.

9377
05:44:43,030 --> 05:44:43,750
Sorry, man.

9378
05:44:43,770 --> 05:44:44,710
I fucked up, bro.

9379
05:44:45,010 --> 05:44:46,210
I'm the leader for the team.

9380
05:44:46,310 --> 05:44:47,050
And we didn't make it.

9381
05:44:48,090 --> 05:44:50,010
We didn't make it to the top 10.

9382
05:44:50,310 --> 05:44:53,510
So we have to play an extra day.

9383
05:44:53,550 --> 05:44:54,350
And we need him.

9384
05:44:55,170 --> 05:44:57,510
We have to play an extra day.

9385
05:44:57,710 --> 05:44:58,370
And we need him.

9386
05:44:58,470 --> 05:44:59,490
He's our high GL.

9387
05:45:05,210 --> 05:45:06,390
There we go.

9388
05:45:10,550 --> 05:45:11,970
You can send that to him.

9389
05:45:12,050 --> 05:45:12,850
He'll understand.

9390
05:45:18,990 --> 05:45:20,730
Yeah, I'm sure he will.

9391
05:45:20,890 --> 05:45:21,830
I'm sure he will.

9392
05:45:22,690 --> 05:45:24,530
I'm hoping I don't have to send it.

9393
05:45:24,670 --> 05:45:26,430
I'm hoping we just qualify.

9394
05:45:26,910 --> 05:45:28,890
Are you waiting until we qualify?

9395
05:45:29,170 --> 05:45:31,130
Yes, I am waiting.

9396
05:45:33,410 --> 05:45:34,590
20 points, guys.

9397
05:45:34,710 --> 05:45:35,310
20 points.

9398
05:45:35,370 --> 05:45:36,610
No pressure.

9399
05:45:36,610 --> 05:45:37,450
No pressure.

9400
05:45:37,450 --> 05:45:40,150
Just 20 points.

9401
05:45:40,670 --> 05:45:42,070
Yeah, just 20 points.

9402
05:45:42,070 --> 05:45:43,050
We have to win.

9403
05:45:43,550 --> 05:45:45,830
We literally have to.

9404
05:45:46,090 --> 05:45:48,770
Guys, if we don't win, we get knocked out.

9405
05:45:50,070 --> 05:45:53,170
We get knocked out like the Falcons did.

9406
05:45:53,230 --> 05:45:54,210
And won the BLGS.

9407
05:45:57,010 --> 05:45:59,230
Why are we bringing that up?

9408
05:45:59,530 --> 05:45:59,670
What?

9409
05:46:00,090 --> 05:46:01,490
You got a problem with them?

9410
05:46:03,110 --> 05:46:04,830
Zero pissed you off or something?

9411
05:46:04,830 --> 05:46:05,850
No, I just...

9412
05:46:05,850 --> 05:46:08,410
Okay, but who hasn't been pissed off though, to be fair?

9413
05:46:12,450 --> 05:46:14,650
Hasn't he been really angry?

9414
05:46:16,250 --> 05:46:17,310
No, I just...

9415
05:46:17,310 --> 05:46:21,850
I just remember how people were like, Whoa, they didn't make it?

9416
05:46:22,590 --> 05:46:23,890
There's a backpack right here.

9417
05:46:24,990 --> 05:46:25,570
Yeah.

9418
05:46:28,230 --> 05:46:38,070
To be fair, Both Waldse and Hal are like not the greatest mechanical players and like fighting for controller is just rough.

9419
05:46:38,210 --> 05:46:43,350
To be fair, they put three IGLs in one team.

9420
05:46:43,450 --> 05:46:44,750
I don't know what they expected.

9421
05:46:46,030 --> 05:46:49,630
Yeah, I mean, Waldse is not really an IGL.

9422
05:46:50,690 --> 05:46:52,390
He was IGL in his last team.

9423
05:46:53,530 --> 05:46:54,750
Yeah, he was.

9424
05:46:55,150 --> 05:46:55,930
Do you need a triple take?

9425
05:46:58,110 --> 05:46:59,170
Or do you have one?

9426
05:46:59,970 --> 05:47:01,590
Yeah, I'll take a triple take.

9427
05:47:01,670 --> 05:47:02,770
There's one over here.

9428
05:47:05,470 --> 05:47:06,990
Remember to do the console.

9429
05:47:08,850 --> 05:47:09,650
Yep, yep, yep.

9430
05:47:09,690 --> 05:47:11,790
Just picking up stuff that I need to.

9431
05:47:11,810 --> 05:47:12,870
Remember to get meds.

9432
05:47:12,890 --> 05:47:14,030
Remember to get meds.

9433
05:47:14,110 --> 05:47:14,990
They're very important.

9434
05:47:15,770 --> 05:47:17,370
You don't want to get bot reviewed.

9435
05:47:19,850 --> 05:47:21,670
Wait, we want to instant rotate in here.

9436
05:47:21,750 --> 05:47:22,390
I have one evac.

9437
05:47:22,810 --> 05:47:24,690
Can you hit the console to run?

9438
05:47:24,690 --> 05:47:26,070
Okay, console time.

9439
05:47:28,770 --> 05:47:34,010
I would say their biggest problem, honestly, is just having two controller players and a Gibby meta.

9440
05:47:34,470 --> 05:47:37,610
Their controller players are not very good.

9441
05:47:39,670 --> 05:47:41,190
Yo, my ping is 300.

9442
05:47:46,330 --> 05:47:47,770
Come hit the evac.

9443
05:47:49,090 --> 05:47:50,090
We're just leaving right away.

9444
05:47:50,350 --> 05:47:50,890
Okay, 200.

9445
05:47:51,030 --> 05:47:51,590
I got 200.

9446
05:47:52,270 --> 05:47:54,170
We want to be in this house here.

9447
05:47:54,670 --> 05:47:54,950
Okay.

9448
05:47:55,570 --> 05:47:56,630
Drag, drag, drag.

9449
05:47:57,030 --> 05:47:58,270
Drag, drag, drag.

9450
05:47:58,330 --> 05:48:00,470
You have to go hit the evac.

9451
05:48:01,390 --> 05:48:02,170
Right now.

9452
05:48:03,270 --> 05:48:05,290
You have to hit it right now.

9453
05:48:05,570 --> 05:48:06,150
It's going to fade.

9454
05:48:07,990 --> 05:48:10,010
I think we just keep going ahead.

9455
05:48:10,210 --> 05:48:10,510
Yeah.

9456
05:48:10,970 --> 05:48:12,390
He's going to be really behind though.

9457
05:48:12,830 --> 05:48:13,330
Yeah, I know.

9458
05:48:13,790 --> 05:48:14,150
It's fine.

9459
05:48:14,670 --> 05:48:17,190
Are we taking that same house or a different house?

9460
05:48:17,450 --> 05:48:18,810
We want this house here.

9461
05:48:22,430 --> 05:48:23,230
Man, I'm...

9462
05:48:23,710 --> 05:48:26,350
Yeah, I'm pretty sure zone will pull on us.

9463
05:48:26,570 --> 05:48:26,990
Okay.

9464
05:48:27,310 --> 05:48:28,350
Like on this cannon here.

9465
05:48:30,070 --> 05:48:31,670
Oh, I hear another...

9466
05:48:32,610 --> 05:48:33,330
another evac.

9467
05:48:34,090 --> 05:48:34,630
Follow where we are.

9468
05:48:36,370 --> 05:48:37,370
Look at this.

9469
05:48:37,750 --> 05:48:38,450
You have to shoot for him.

9470
05:48:38,870 --> 05:48:39,290
Just keep running.

9471
05:48:42,490 --> 05:48:44,150
I don't think he's going to make it.

9472
05:48:44,450 --> 05:48:44,950
It's fine.

9473
05:48:45,730 --> 05:48:46,530
Just keep crawling.

9474
05:48:47,110 --> 05:48:48,210
Let's keep cracking and crawling.

9475
05:48:49,710 --> 05:48:51,150
They might bubble on us.

9476
05:48:52,110 --> 05:48:53,270
They might bubble on us.

9477
05:48:54,510 --> 05:48:55,550
Are we getting flown on?

9478
05:48:57,470 --> 05:48:58,130
No, we're okay.

9479
05:48:58,350 --> 05:48:59,670
They might bubble car on us.

9480
05:48:59,870 --> 05:49:00,470
I'm playing roof.

9481
05:49:00,790 --> 05:49:03,770
Well, just as soon as I got all the bats, I fucking died.

9482
05:49:05,490 --> 05:49:08,670
Yeah, we don't have any walls, so that's like the worst part.

9483
05:49:09,330 --> 05:49:10,690
And there's no crafter near us.

9484
05:49:11,010 --> 05:49:13,030
I have a rez.

9485
05:49:13,050 --> 05:49:14,830
We have to sit here and stare at them pretty much the whole time.

9486
05:49:14,830 --> 05:49:16,070
Yeah, I have a rez.

9487
05:49:16,330 --> 05:49:18,010
Maybe you can figure out a way to get them.

9488
05:49:18,350 --> 05:49:19,950
There's no way we can get out until they leave.

9489
05:49:20,590 --> 05:49:21,370
We just have to sit here.

9490
05:49:22,710 --> 05:49:24,250
Do you want me to look anywhere else?

9491
05:49:24,330 --> 05:49:25,350
Or do you want me to look at them?

9492
05:49:25,610 --> 05:49:26,950
No, just hard stare at them.

9493
05:49:27,230 --> 05:49:28,010
They're going to hit the car.

9494
05:49:28,150 --> 05:49:29,670
I think I can go now.

9495
05:49:30,330 --> 05:49:32,330
You keep looking at them hard.

9496
05:49:35,630 --> 05:49:36,570
They don't know, I think.

9497
05:49:39,610 --> 05:49:40,430
I have to heal, though.

9498
05:49:42,270 --> 05:49:43,330
I'm still looking for you.

9499
05:49:43,330 --> 05:49:44,490
I have a rez.

9500
05:49:44,750 --> 05:49:46,030
There's a team right here.

9501
05:49:46,270 --> 05:49:47,230
I'm poking them.

9502
05:49:50,170 --> 05:49:51,310
I can throw a bubble whenever.

9503
05:49:52,230 --> 05:49:53,690
They might do my hard push, though.

9504
05:49:54,210 --> 05:49:54,450
I'm okay.

9505
05:49:55,250 --> 05:49:55,950
Don't rez yet.

9506
05:49:57,390 --> 05:49:58,510
I can ult them.

9507
05:49:58,510 --> 05:49:59,470
We need to get to the roof.

9508
05:50:03,370 --> 05:50:04,890
I'm looking at this team over here.

9509
05:50:06,410 --> 05:50:07,550
They're just getting shot at.

9510
05:50:08,390 --> 05:50:10,490
I have my own mobi here.

9511
05:50:10,590 --> 05:50:11,730
I'm just going to put it down on the roof.

9512
05:50:12,610 --> 05:50:13,770
Oh my god.

9513
05:50:13,870 --> 05:50:15,430
They destroyed my door.

9514
05:50:15,750 --> 05:50:16,510
They destroyed my door.

9515
05:50:17,110 --> 05:50:18,830
This other team is rotating to the right.

9516
05:50:19,530 --> 05:50:20,750
I think they might zip to us.

9517
05:50:21,070 --> 05:50:22,910
I'm looking at them right now.

9518
05:50:26,150 --> 05:50:27,950
This is my last two shield cells.

9519
05:50:28,130 --> 05:50:29,970
I literally can't heal anymore.

9520
05:50:30,630 --> 05:50:31,670
I have one shield cell left.

9521
05:50:32,550 --> 05:50:33,970
Gibby's flashed here on the...

9522
05:50:33,970 --> 05:50:34,470
He's one!

9523
05:50:34,930 --> 05:50:37,030
There's another car.

9524
05:50:37,270 --> 05:50:37,910
That's them.

9525
05:50:37,910 --> 05:50:39,010
They're just grabbing cash.

9526
05:50:40,230 --> 05:50:40,990
I can't.

9527
05:50:42,150 --> 05:50:46,170
There's a team in front of me that's looking at me, too.

9528
05:50:46,270 --> 05:50:47,010
This team in front of me.

9529
05:50:48,230 --> 05:50:48,990
In seconds.

9530
05:50:49,570 --> 05:50:50,410
Scratch on Major Road.

9531
05:50:51,290 --> 05:50:53,170
Can you bubble up the left door here?

9532
05:50:53,910 --> 05:50:54,910
Can you bubble under us?

9533
05:50:57,010 --> 05:50:58,050
Bubble on the door.

9534
05:50:58,770 --> 05:50:59,830
We want to jump down.

9535
05:51:01,330 --> 05:51:01,770
I bubbled it.

9536
05:51:02,710 --> 05:51:03,970
I have no shield cells left.

9537
05:51:04,970 --> 05:51:05,530
Come, George.

9538
05:51:05,530 --> 05:51:07,490
I have to use all of them.

9539
05:51:07,490 --> 05:51:08,270
I'll give you heals.

9540
05:51:10,710 --> 05:51:11,930
Give me one second.

9541
05:51:12,230 --> 05:51:13,430
I'm dropping a bat for Gerard.

9542
05:51:14,410 --> 05:51:16,690
I dropped three cells for you.

9543
05:51:17,490 --> 05:51:18,890
I'm 1-4 now.

9544
05:51:19,070 --> 05:51:21,150
We have a really bad economy.

9545
05:51:21,630 --> 05:51:22,670
Gerard and AFK.

9546
05:51:23,350 --> 05:51:24,830
I don't think we should poke anymore.

9547
05:51:24,850 --> 05:51:26,590
You can peek off gun shield, but that's it.

9548
05:51:27,590 --> 05:51:28,930
We're running back here.

9549
05:51:29,850 --> 05:51:30,790
Gibby's peeking us.

9550
05:51:31,790 --> 05:51:32,070
Just chill.

9551
05:51:32,070 --> 05:51:33,330
Start putting walls around.

9552
05:51:34,350 --> 05:51:36,370
Put walls at the bottom first.

9553
05:51:37,230 --> 05:51:38,470
Put walls here.

9554
05:51:39,210 --> 05:51:39,970
And here.

9555
05:51:40,210 --> 05:51:41,490
So we know they push us.

9556
05:51:41,490 --> 05:51:43,670
Make sure we don't die if someone pushes us again.

9557
05:51:43,810 --> 05:51:44,470
On the stairs?

9558
05:51:44,670 --> 05:51:45,270
Here.

9559
05:51:46,430 --> 05:51:47,990
Just put against the wall.

9560
05:51:48,410 --> 05:51:49,110
And against this wall.

9561
05:51:49,830 --> 05:51:50,470
Against this door.

9562
05:51:51,470 --> 05:51:52,070
And this one here.

9563
05:51:53,190 --> 05:51:54,130
Seven seconds.

9564
05:51:55,170 --> 05:51:56,710
Use all three.

9565
05:51:57,070 --> 05:51:58,370
So they don't walk up.

9566
05:51:58,370 --> 05:51:58,550
Okay.

9567
05:51:59,710 --> 05:52:01,430
So we'll hear it when they walk up.

9568
05:52:04,390 --> 05:52:05,850
Because we don't need as much up here.

9569
05:52:05,870 --> 05:52:05,930
Okay.

9570
05:52:06,150 --> 05:52:06,910
16 more seconds.

9571
05:52:08,850 --> 05:52:09,890
Should I take these?

9572
05:52:10,090 --> 05:52:10,670
Should I take this?

9573
05:52:10,730 --> 05:52:13,690
Just put the bottoms first and then we'll worry about the top.

9574
05:52:14,650 --> 05:52:15,050
Okay.

9575
05:52:26,810 --> 05:52:27,210
Okay.

9576
05:52:27,230 --> 05:52:28,410
We have three down here.

9577
05:52:30,270 --> 05:52:31,070
Put one...

9578
05:52:31,070 --> 05:52:32,150
Refresh this one.

9579
05:52:32,630 --> 05:52:33,050
Don't peek yet.

9580
05:52:33,110 --> 05:52:33,410
Don't peek.

9581
05:52:34,430 --> 05:52:35,250
Don't try trifling.

9582
05:52:36,610 --> 05:52:38,330
And yeah, just refresh that.

9583
05:52:39,250 --> 05:52:40,050
Yeah, listen.

9584
05:52:41,490 --> 05:52:43,450
I think we can peek a little bit.

9585
05:52:43,770 --> 05:52:46,130
And play off regen with castle wall slam.

9586
05:52:46,670 --> 05:52:46,930
Okay.

9587
05:52:47,150 --> 05:52:47,470
I'm purple already.

9588
05:52:49,630 --> 05:52:50,990
You want me to come over to you then?

9589
05:52:50,990 --> 05:52:53,370
If you guys get wrecked, we'll just slam castle wall.

9590
05:52:53,370 --> 05:52:53,730
Oh, okay.

9591
05:52:53,850 --> 05:52:54,670
You'll just slam.

9592
05:52:54,770 --> 05:52:54,950
Okay.

9593
05:52:55,830 --> 05:52:57,570
I don't think this team has Gibby.

9594
05:52:58,510 --> 05:52:59,650
No, they did.

9595
05:52:59,750 --> 05:53:00,930
Because that's the...

9596
05:53:00,930 --> 05:53:01,930
They bubbled that anyway.

9597
05:53:02,050 --> 05:53:02,810
Unless it's a new skin.

9598
05:53:02,810 --> 05:53:03,830
Yeah, you're right.

9599
05:53:04,550 --> 05:53:07,450
1, 2, 3, 4...

9600
05:53:07,450 --> 05:53:08,190
We have one more.

9601
05:53:08,370 --> 05:53:09,490
Can you put it right here?

9602
05:53:11,130 --> 05:53:12,270
For the last...

9603
05:53:12,930 --> 05:53:13,990
Last door right here.

9604
05:53:14,790 --> 05:53:15,430
We should be fine.

9605
05:53:17,010 --> 05:53:18,690
You guys have to make sure you're like...

9606
05:53:18,690 --> 05:53:19,830
Properly watching like...

9607
05:53:21,190 --> 05:53:23,850
Remember how we got to this building in that one game?

9608
05:53:24,150 --> 05:53:24,370
Yeah.

9609
05:53:25,310 --> 05:53:25,950
Oh, shit.

9610
05:53:26,030 --> 05:53:27,630
We have to make sure no one does that to us.

9611
05:53:28,450 --> 05:53:29,150
Oh, shit.

9612
05:53:29,410 --> 05:53:30,510
Someone's over here.

9613
05:53:30,510 --> 05:53:31,170
Shot me.

9614
05:53:31,510 --> 05:53:32,050
Over here.

9615
05:53:32,410 --> 05:53:37,230
This is bad.

9616
05:53:37,290 --> 05:53:37,990
There's a lot of angles.

9617
05:53:38,190 --> 05:53:38,990
Don't peek anymore.

9618
05:53:39,370 --> 05:53:40,130
You don't need to...

9619
05:53:40,130 --> 05:53:40,870
Flying in on me, I think.

9620
05:53:41,150 --> 05:53:41,930
Yeah, flying in on me.

9621
05:53:42,070 --> 05:53:42,670
Directly on me.

9622
05:53:42,810 --> 05:53:44,050
Flying literally on me.

9623
05:53:44,370 --> 05:53:44,630
Peek!

9624
05:53:44,830 --> 05:53:44,830
Peek!

9625
05:53:44,950 --> 05:53:44,950
Peek!

9626
05:53:45,010 --> 05:53:45,010
Peek!

9627
05:53:45,230 --> 05:53:46,090
I'm okay.

9628
05:53:49,730 --> 05:53:50,530
I couldn't...

9629
05:53:51,070 --> 05:53:51,910
They're killable here.

9630
05:53:52,490 --> 05:53:53,810
Shoot this with the Rampart.

9631
05:53:54,870 --> 05:53:56,230
This team is looking at me.

9632
05:53:56,650 --> 05:53:56,830
Where?

9633
05:53:57,010 --> 05:53:57,230
Where?

9634
05:53:57,230 --> 05:53:57,490
Oh my god.

9635
05:53:57,590 --> 05:53:58,230
I couldn't...

9636
05:53:58,890 --> 05:53:59,910
Shoot the door.

9637
05:54:00,470 --> 05:54:01,050
Spray this.

9638
05:54:03,270 --> 05:54:04,070
Spray it, Joren.

9639
05:54:05,170 --> 05:54:05,850
Spray the door.

9640
05:54:06,610 --> 05:54:07,030
Come to me.

9641
05:54:08,610 --> 05:54:10,030
Just keep shooting into that.

9642
05:54:11,370 --> 05:54:11,570
There.

9643
05:54:11,970 --> 05:54:12,190
Open.

9644
05:54:13,310 --> 05:54:13,530
Okay.

9645
05:54:17,490 --> 05:54:18,370
Where's your...

9646
05:54:18,370 --> 05:54:19,250
I don't have...

9647
05:54:19,250 --> 05:54:20,190
Castle wall anymore.

9648
05:54:20,830 --> 05:54:22,570
Okay, take one of the doors away.

9649
05:54:22,690 --> 05:54:24,950
We need to put a shield back here.

9650
05:54:26,910 --> 05:54:28,410
Because now you have to do it again.

9651
05:54:29,070 --> 05:54:30,890
Because you have to take away one of the doors.

9652
05:54:34,450 --> 05:54:35,870
And remember to do this one too.

9653
05:54:35,970 --> 05:54:36,510
Remember this door.

9654
05:54:37,770 --> 05:54:38,170
Oh shit.

9655
05:54:41,610 --> 05:54:42,870
Let me know when you have your ult.

9656
05:54:43,150 --> 05:54:45,170
I only have one shield cell so I'll recharge off your ult.

9657
05:54:45,190 --> 05:54:47,550
I have two shield cells so I won't recharge off your ult.

9658
05:54:54,120 --> 05:54:54,760
Fifty percent.

9659
05:54:56,400 --> 05:54:57,300
Oh my god.

9660
05:54:57,360 --> 05:54:58,160
Okay, I can't peek now.

9661
05:54:58,160 --> 05:54:59,220
I'll wait.

9662
05:55:00,380 --> 05:55:02,580
I thought I could last...

9663
05:55:02,580 --> 05:55:06,200
They hit through my shield instantly.

9664
05:55:14,160 --> 05:55:18,060
I'll just fully heal my white meds.

9665
05:55:18,420 --> 05:55:19,900
Yeah, I'm 20% here.

9666
05:55:31,900 --> 05:55:33,520
Seventeen teams.

9667
05:55:42,330 --> 05:55:43,010
We're so...

9668
05:55:43,510 --> 05:55:44,230
We're so healthy.

9669
05:55:44,930 --> 05:55:46,750
Okay, I'm shield celling in.

9670
05:55:47,490 --> 05:55:48,150
No, no, no.

9671
05:55:48,190 --> 05:55:48,850
They're full on the rock.

9672
05:55:50,510 --> 05:55:51,070
Come to me.

9673
05:55:51,330 --> 05:55:51,830
Come to me.

9674
05:55:52,650 --> 05:55:53,230
He's in my corner.

9675
05:55:55,890 --> 05:55:56,310
Come here, come here.

9676
05:56:00,810 --> 05:56:01,970
They broke this one.

9677
05:56:02,090 --> 05:56:03,470
Oh, they broke this one too.

9678
05:56:11,150 --> 05:56:12,550
Our little home.

9679
05:56:12,730 --> 05:56:13,110
Andy, open here.

9680
05:56:13,290 --> 05:56:13,430
Castle.

9681
05:56:13,550 --> 05:56:14,110
Okay, I'm looking.

9682
05:56:15,030 --> 05:56:15,890
I don't see them.

9683
05:56:19,430 --> 05:56:20,610
I'm looking at the story.

9684
05:56:22,010 --> 05:56:22,730
Bin's refreshed.

9685
05:56:24,750 --> 05:56:26,450
Can you bubble up this way?

9686
05:56:27,030 --> 05:56:27,210
Yeah.

9687
05:56:29,150 --> 05:56:29,870
Oh, nevermind.

9688
05:56:30,010 --> 05:56:30,730
No, no, no, no.

9689
05:56:31,490 --> 05:56:32,110
I'm fine, I'm fine.

9690
05:56:32,790 --> 05:56:34,050
They're like hard staring at us.

9691
05:56:34,050 --> 05:56:35,210
Okay, that's fine.

9692
05:56:35,330 --> 05:56:37,150
They broke our wall here.

9693
05:56:37,530 --> 05:56:37,610
Yeah.

9694
05:56:42,220 --> 05:56:44,120
I can't even peek that.

9695
05:56:53,480 --> 05:56:54,740
They bubbled it.

9696
05:56:54,800 --> 05:56:56,040
They took the stuff in there.

9697
05:57:01,280 --> 05:57:02,440
Almost killed Rampart here.

9698
05:57:02,640 --> 05:57:02,960
Shoot this.

9699
05:57:03,040 --> 05:57:04,400
I'm looking.

9700
05:57:05,060 --> 05:57:05,640
I hit 40.

9701
05:57:06,160 --> 05:57:07,700
He's so low.

9702
05:57:08,240 --> 05:57:09,040
I hit 90.

9703
05:57:09,760 --> 05:57:10,920
I'm throwing a nade in there.

9704
05:57:12,300 --> 05:57:13,940
There's like all of us are looking at him.

9705
05:57:15,460 --> 05:57:16,140
I killed one.

9706
05:57:16,220 --> 05:57:16,460
I killed one.

9707
05:57:17,680 --> 05:57:18,820
You bubble up on this.

9708
05:57:19,120 --> 05:57:21,280
Okay, I'm following.

9709
05:57:21,540 --> 05:57:22,220
No, stay, stay, stay.

9710
05:57:22,440 --> 05:57:23,200
You stay, you stay.

9711
05:57:24,060 --> 05:57:24,400
You stay.

9712
05:57:25,420 --> 05:57:26,240
Alright, alright.

9713
05:57:27,820 --> 05:57:29,040
I threw a nade behind them.

9714
05:57:29,980 --> 05:57:30,420
Two seconds.

9715
05:57:31,600 --> 05:57:32,560
Come, come, my way.

9716
05:57:33,700 --> 05:57:34,600
I killed one inside.

9717
05:57:36,880 --> 05:57:37,620
90 on him.

9718
05:57:37,700 --> 05:57:38,240
You killed him.

9719
05:57:38,320 --> 05:57:39,360
No, he's one.

9720
05:57:39,880 --> 05:57:41,560
Come to us.

9721
05:57:41,680 --> 05:57:43,500
Come, come, come.

9722
05:57:44,120 --> 05:57:45,580
Oh my god, he was one HP.

9723
05:57:47,120 --> 05:57:48,420
He's getting pushed right now.

9724
05:57:48,440 --> 05:57:49,460
He's just killed two guys.

9725
05:57:49,740 --> 05:57:52,440
Try and stop fighting.

9726
05:57:52,600 --> 05:57:53,100
Run up.

9727
05:57:53,400 --> 05:57:55,000
Oh no, he's getting shit at.

9728
05:57:56,620 --> 05:57:57,580
Squad wipe!

9729
05:57:58,920 --> 05:58:00,020
What the fuck?

9730
05:58:00,040 --> 05:58:01,960
What happened over there?

9731
05:58:04,840 --> 05:58:05,600
What happened?

9732
05:58:07,180 --> 05:58:08,880
No, don't, don't.

9733
05:58:09,000 --> 05:58:11,040
What the fuck?

9734
05:58:11,240 --> 05:58:12,300
Wait, you cooked?

9735
05:58:12,780 --> 05:58:16,400
Oh my god, what happened?

9736
05:58:16,460 --> 05:58:16,840
Oh my god.

9737
05:58:17,400 --> 05:58:19,160
Oh my god, what happened?

9738
05:58:19,760 --> 05:58:20,840
Oh my god, what happened?

9739
05:58:21,240 --> 05:58:22,120
What happened?

9740
05:58:26,300 --> 05:58:27,400
What'd you do?

9741
05:58:27,700 --> 05:58:29,840
I don't even know what happened over there.

9742
05:58:29,840 --> 05:58:31,160
Redemption arc!

9743
05:58:31,760 --> 05:58:32,280
Redemption!

9744
05:58:35,120 --> 05:58:37,840
To be fair, like...

9745
05:58:38,400 --> 05:58:40,380
Like what happened over there?

9746
05:58:40,480 --> 05:58:41,980
Oh my god, who the fuck did I kill?

9747
05:58:42,240 --> 05:58:43,240
I don't even know.

9748
05:58:43,360 --> 05:58:44,560
I fucked up though.

9749
05:58:45,860 --> 05:58:48,180
I whiffed my master shot.

9750
05:58:48,940 --> 05:58:51,600
I whiffed one shot and then it fucked us over.

9751
05:58:55,560 --> 05:58:57,960
I whiffed the shot that would've killed them.

9752
05:58:57,960 --> 05:58:59,200
Oh my god.

9753
05:59:02,700 --> 05:59:04,340
That was crazy.

9754
05:59:05,060 --> 05:59:07,180
I guess we're gonna have to go tomorrow.

9755
05:59:07,820 --> 05:59:08,860
Guys, guys.

9756
05:59:09,120 --> 05:59:10,740
You have to send the message, man.

9757
05:59:12,620 --> 05:59:14,060
Oh wait, I'll edit it.

9758
05:59:14,420 --> 05:59:15,780
Don't worry, I'll edit it.

9759
05:59:15,940 --> 05:59:18,060
I whiffed my one massive shot.

9760
05:59:21,780 --> 05:59:23,540
I'll train after this, I promise.

9761
05:59:23,720 --> 05:59:24,260
I'll train.

9762
05:59:24,260 --> 05:59:29,520
I whiffed my one shot that would've killed that team.

9763
05:59:29,960 --> 05:59:30,940
My bad.

9764
05:59:36,620 --> 05:59:40,040
Look, we all had clutch moments in each game, guys.

9765
05:59:40,220 --> 05:59:41,920
We all had clutch moments.

9766
05:59:43,220 --> 05:59:44,660
Look, that's your character arc.

9767
05:59:44,840 --> 05:59:47,580
You grew as a player from that.

9768
05:59:50,760 --> 05:59:51,980
Isn't that insane?

9769
05:59:51,980 --> 05:59:53,720
Oh my god, they took over our house.

9770
05:59:54,740 --> 05:59:56,180
It's free real estate now.

9771
05:59:57,700 --> 05:59:59,680
Hey, at least they have zero meds from us.

9772
06:00:01,000 --> 06:00:04,240
Oh, but you killed a team with meds!

9773
06:00:04,760 --> 06:00:05,200
Nevermind.

9774
06:00:06,120 --> 06:00:08,140
You literally killed a team that had meds.

9775
06:00:11,160 --> 06:00:16,300
I think if we stayed in that house, we could've maybe...

9776
06:00:16,300 --> 06:00:18,680
We could've just took over the other...

9777
06:00:18,680 --> 06:00:20,440
Oh no, but then this team would've pushed us.

9778
06:00:20,440 --> 06:00:21,160
Nevermind.

9779
06:00:23,300 --> 06:00:24,980
Did you 1v3, Gerard?

9780
06:00:25,740 --> 06:00:26,000
Yeah.

9781
06:00:26,440 --> 06:00:26,960
Wow!

9782
06:00:28,040 --> 06:00:30,200
Yeah, they were all coupled up inside.

9783
06:00:30,360 --> 06:00:32,020
I started spraying.

9784
06:00:32,360 --> 06:00:33,340
You just started spraying?

9785
06:00:33,640 --> 06:00:35,960
Oh my god, that's crazy!

9786
06:00:38,120 --> 06:00:41,280
Thank god I didn't run after you, because they were just waiting.

9787
06:00:41,560 --> 06:00:43,700
That's why I said you have to stay there.

9788
06:00:43,940 --> 06:00:44,940
Yeah, that was a nice call.

9789
06:00:45,280 --> 06:00:46,500
I would've just fucking ran.

9790
06:00:47,300 --> 06:00:51,100
Well, I was surprised that you ran in the open right after without healing yourself.

9791
06:00:52,400 --> 06:00:53,780
I didn't know what to do!

9792
06:00:53,860 --> 06:00:54,380
I was lost!

9793
06:00:55,400 --> 06:01:01,620
You had so much adrenaline inside you, you ran right after the open!

9794
06:01:01,900 --> 06:01:02,920
That was crazy!

9795
06:01:02,940 --> 06:01:05,380
Well, I thought I should go for your stuff!

9796
06:01:06,260 --> 06:01:07,980
You could've full healed, bro!

9797
06:01:08,140 --> 06:01:09,340
You could've full healed!

9798
06:01:10,840 --> 06:01:11,760
I'm sorry.

9799
06:01:11,900 --> 06:01:13,960
No, no, no, you did great though.

9800
06:01:13,960 --> 06:01:14,780
That was insane.

9801
06:01:15,280 --> 06:01:17,720
That was insane, that 1v3.

9802
06:01:18,840 --> 06:01:19,880
Tomorrow, tomorrow.

9803
06:01:20,340 --> 06:01:21,100
I'll do better.

9804
06:01:21,540 --> 06:01:22,680
That was actually crazy.

9805
06:01:23,160 --> 06:01:25,220
I will never...

9806
06:01:25,220 --> 06:01:30,100
It would've been nicer if we had top 10 at least.

9807
06:01:31,440 --> 06:01:32,560
I'm sorry.

9808
06:01:32,800 --> 06:01:39,240
I think it was also my fault that I dropped a bunch of my batteries that I could've gotten.

9809
06:01:39,880 --> 06:01:41,400
But yeah, it was...

9810
06:01:41,400 --> 06:01:42,560
No, it's fine.

9811
06:01:43,040 --> 06:01:44,900
You just gotta be faster.

9812
06:01:46,180 --> 06:01:51,340
You got picked because you were the last one running and you were so far from us that we couldn't help you.

9813
06:01:51,440 --> 06:01:53,140
So you just gotta be faster in your rotations.

9814
06:01:54,540 --> 06:01:55,100
Okay, okay.

9815
06:01:55,200 --> 06:01:56,080
That's really it.

9816
06:01:57,520 --> 06:01:59,660
You gotta be there.

9817
06:01:59,820 --> 06:02:00,720
You had to be there.

9818
06:02:03,340 --> 06:02:09,560
I think the biggest mistake at the end there was not just all three sending that hot hug.

9819
06:02:09,560 --> 06:02:11,980
Yeah, definitely what we should've done.

9820
06:02:12,380 --> 06:02:14,180
Because two teams ended up fighting for that house.

9821
06:02:14,840 --> 06:02:16,480
Like for our house as soon as we left.

9822
06:02:16,740 --> 06:02:20,180
We would still be fine and we can take a roof.

9823
06:02:21,260 --> 06:02:22,660
This team is playing roof now.

9824
06:02:23,380 --> 06:02:25,740
We just need to not...

9825
06:02:25,740 --> 06:02:28,460
I didn't know two teams ran for the house.

9826
06:02:29,440 --> 06:02:32,540
That's why Gerard managed to get three kills.

9827
06:02:32,700 --> 06:02:33,700
They were fighting each other.

9828
06:02:35,560 --> 06:02:36,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9829
06:02:43,180 --> 06:02:43,980
That's crazy.

9830
06:02:44,600 --> 06:02:45,860
I should've thrown a nade too.

9831
06:02:45,960 --> 06:02:47,880
I could've thrown a nade in there with you.

9832
06:02:48,580 --> 06:02:50,520
I was just like, I'm just gonna go in.

9833
06:02:52,260 --> 06:02:54,800
You're going in, I don't wanna go in too.

9834
06:02:56,320 --> 06:02:58,400
If I threw a nade in there, I think that would've helped us.

9835
06:02:59,880 --> 06:03:01,540
Because I had like...

9836
06:03:01,540 --> 06:03:04,040
They ran to the other side of the wall, I think.

9837
06:03:04,520 --> 06:03:05,840
And then ran back in.

9838
06:03:06,320 --> 06:03:08,020
I don't think it would've made too much of a difference.

9839
06:03:08,020 --> 06:03:11,220
Yeah, but it would've like, cluttered...

9840
06:03:11,220 --> 06:03:15,100
Made them in a corner more.

9841
06:03:15,620 --> 06:03:18,460
We had to fight two rampart walls there.

9842
06:03:19,440 --> 06:03:20,200
Which was a struggle.

9843
06:03:21,400 --> 06:03:23,220
I was in a struggle bus there.

9844
06:03:25,840 --> 06:03:26,700
Oh my god, wait!

9845
06:03:26,960 --> 06:03:27,780
You're right, Chad!

9846
06:03:28,020 --> 06:03:29,980
From 14 damage to 3 digits?

9847
06:03:30,740 --> 06:03:33,500
I'll see you guys here for international scrims.

9848
06:03:33,820 --> 06:03:37,500
Oh yeah, you have international scrims literally in a couple of minutes.

9849
06:03:37,620 --> 06:03:38,720
Literally right now.

9850
06:03:41,440 --> 06:03:44,980
From this to international scrims, good luck!

9851
06:03:46,000 --> 06:03:47,880
Yeah, I mean you're warmed up, right?

9852
06:03:48,140 --> 06:03:49,260
Is it still Apex?

9853
06:03:49,520 --> 06:03:51,940
Yeah, that's international scrims.

9854
06:03:51,940 --> 06:03:52,460
No, he's gone.

9855
06:03:53,060 --> 06:03:53,940
He's literally gone.

9856
06:03:55,820 --> 06:03:57,160
He's really gone!

9857
06:03:57,240 --> 06:04:00,240
He had to go to international scrims right now!

9858
06:04:00,680 --> 06:04:01,220
He's gone!

9859
06:04:02,140 --> 06:04:04,720
His last playthrough was with us!

9860
06:04:06,020 --> 06:04:10,140
No, he's gonna feel more motivated and he's like, I'm sorry I ever yelled at you guys.

9861
06:04:11,780 --> 06:04:14,100
He's gonna be like, I'm sorry team.

9862
06:04:14,320 --> 06:04:15,820
You guys are the best I ever got.

9863
06:04:15,980 --> 06:04:17,640
I'm sorry I ever yelled at you guys.

9864
06:04:19,960 --> 06:04:26,020
I now know how hard it is to play with other people.

9865
06:04:28,080 --> 06:04:29,440
Yeah, it is.

9866
06:04:29,740 --> 06:04:31,740
It is very hard, I could tell.

9867
06:04:33,860 --> 06:04:35,280
I think he had fun though.

9868
06:04:35,500 --> 06:04:37,360
Of course I did, of course!

9869
06:04:38,480 --> 06:04:45,320
Jesus Christ, I don't know what you guys are gatekeeping Apex for, but I think it's a really great game.

9870
06:04:45,400 --> 06:04:47,620
I invited you!

9871
06:04:48,620 --> 06:04:52,280
You were like, don't go down to this path.

9872
06:04:52,420 --> 06:04:55,080
I'm sort of interested in this because you guys are so awesome.

9873
06:04:55,080 --> 06:04:56,600
You're interested in the tournament side?

9874
06:04:59,120 --> 06:05:00,160
I mean...

9875
06:05:00,160 --> 06:05:02,100
No, we weren't gatekeeping the tournament.

9876
06:05:02,100 --> 06:05:04,660
We're gatekeeping being addicted.

9877
06:05:05,060 --> 06:05:06,760
Yeah, that one!

9878
06:05:07,260 --> 06:05:09,600
I definitely want to keep playing.

9879
06:05:10,060 --> 06:05:11,160
This is different.

9880
06:05:11,760 --> 06:05:13,420
I literally didn't even...

9881
06:05:13,420 --> 06:05:17,560
I could play more Apex to get...

9882
06:05:17,560 --> 06:05:24,980
I honestly don't think playing more Apex for me right now would actually change the result.

9883
06:05:25,380 --> 06:05:27,620
I'm still playing the best as I could.

9884
06:05:28,920 --> 06:05:29,400
Oh...

9885
06:05:29,400 --> 06:05:41,120
I'm just like, the mistakes I make it's just awareness in terms of like I laugh and then they run to me.

9886
06:05:43,100 --> 06:05:44,200
Like, it's just that.

9887
06:05:45,880 --> 06:05:46,600
I mean, for me.

9888
06:05:47,900 --> 06:05:48,860
I think...

9889
06:05:50,060 --> 06:05:53,560
I'd really love to take interest in this one because I've had a lot of fun.

9890
06:05:54,040 --> 06:05:55,320
Yeah, it's like different.

9891
06:05:55,320 --> 06:05:57,040
It's definitely a lot different from regular.

9892
06:05:57,460 --> 06:05:59,600
Yeah, definitely not from tournaments.

9893
06:05:59,800 --> 06:06:00,760
No, no way.

9894
06:06:00,940 --> 06:06:01,740
No, I get it.

9895
06:06:02,960 --> 06:06:07,460
Yeah, but I don't know if I'm going to be playing Apex at all, like literally after this.

9896
06:06:07,600 --> 06:06:10,680
Like, Jesus, I still have to play like a Marvels.

9897
06:06:11,060 --> 06:06:13,280
Oh yeah, there's just so many stuff to do.

9898
06:06:13,860 --> 06:06:17,380
Bro, it's just Mastiff, Mastiff, Mastiff everywhere.

9899
06:06:18,600 --> 06:06:20,560
Well, three squads remaining.

9900
06:06:20,980 --> 06:06:22,020
I think this is it.

9901
06:06:22,200 --> 06:06:22,920
Well, okay.

9902
06:06:22,920 --> 06:06:23,360
That's it.

9903
06:06:23,880 --> 06:06:25,020
That's it, everybody.

9904
06:06:25,340 --> 06:06:26,560
I wonder what placement we got.

9905
06:06:26,660 --> 06:06:30,880
I know we definitely not got 20th because we got two kills.

9906
06:06:31,360 --> 06:06:32,480
We're not 20th place.

9907
06:06:33,640 --> 06:06:35,420
And technically, we did get top five.

9908
06:06:35,620 --> 06:06:36,800
We got top five.

9909
06:06:37,600 --> 06:06:38,560
You're right, you're right.

9910
06:06:38,580 --> 06:06:40,140
Just remember the top five part.

9911
06:06:43,560 --> 06:06:44,520
You did.

9912
06:06:44,600 --> 06:06:45,980
You went through a character arc.

9913
06:06:46,240 --> 06:06:47,920
I did, I know.

9914
06:06:47,920 --> 06:06:49,700
You started off with 14 damage.

9915
06:06:49,700 --> 06:06:52,000
Wait, no, you started off with zero damage.

9916
06:06:52,100 --> 06:06:53,260
You started off with zero damage.

9917
06:06:53,420 --> 06:06:57,020
And now you got 322 damage and three kills.

9918
06:06:57,520 --> 06:07:00,380
And you got in one game.

9919
06:07:01,100 --> 06:07:05,300
Dude, actually getting coached on stream was so fucking cool.

9920
06:07:05,700 --> 06:07:07,780
Both of you were like, no, you gotta put it here.

9921
06:07:08,940 --> 06:07:14,880
When you guys were coaching me putting stuff there, I'd be like, oh shit, so this is how you do shit.

9922
06:07:15,200 --> 06:07:17,280
I used to be doing the opposite of things.

9923
06:07:17,280 --> 06:07:21,620
I was just like, I'm just going to be pulling up in this and never thinking about anything.

9924
06:07:21,800 --> 06:07:25,620
The amount of ammo that I've been picking up, I didn't think about the resource management of that.

9925
06:07:25,900 --> 06:07:28,460
You have to be quicker now, though, too.

9926
06:07:28,640 --> 06:07:31,100
You have to figure out how to be quick on certain things.

9927
06:07:31,940 --> 06:07:33,120
Yeah, for real.

9928
06:07:34,220 --> 06:07:36,900
I'm not going to lie, I think I might play more after stream.

9929
06:07:39,720 --> 06:07:46,960
I'm feeling adrenaline because I feel like we could be a higher rank squad.

9930
06:07:48,640 --> 06:07:50,580
I think there's an awakening.

9931
06:07:51,360 --> 06:07:56,040
Literally in just six hours, you learned so much in six hours.

9932
06:07:56,520 --> 06:07:58,800
Wait, we've been playing for six hours and that wasn't four?

9933
06:07:59,260 --> 06:08:00,660
No, we've been playing for six hours.

9934
06:08:00,760 --> 06:08:03,780
I just want you to know, you're a bronze player.

9935
06:08:04,420 --> 06:08:07,800
You've killed Pred players.

9936
06:08:09,260 --> 06:08:12,960
As a bronze player, because you're 1v3, right?

9937
06:08:13,420 --> 06:08:15,680
Every team here has at least one Pred player.

9938
06:08:16,300 --> 06:08:19,760
So you killed a Pred player as a bronze.

9939
06:08:20,760 --> 06:08:21,240
Stop!

9940
06:08:21,620 --> 06:08:22,500
Shut the fuck up!

9941
06:08:22,500 --> 06:08:23,260
No, you did!

9942
06:08:23,800 --> 06:08:25,420
You did!

9943
06:08:25,840 --> 06:08:30,080
If they knew you were a bronze player, they would be so embarrassed right now.

9944
06:08:32,710 --> 06:08:37,350
Okay, I can't even brag about this in public now because they would be fucking killing me!

9945
06:08:37,730 --> 06:08:38,530
Oh my god!

9946
06:08:38,890 --> 06:08:40,410
I don't want to bring an animosity!

9947
06:08:40,890 --> 06:08:42,530
I didn't even know who I killed!

9948
06:08:42,810 --> 06:08:45,430
Are they even chill with bronze players being here?

9949
06:08:45,770 --> 06:08:53,410
Gerard, you literally killed your... in that game we won championship, we killed your senpai and you were bronze.

9950
06:08:58,440 --> 06:08:59,960
Senpai, oh my god!

9951
06:09:00,760 --> 06:09:01,440
Oh no!

9952
06:09:02,400 --> 06:09:05,960
Guys, do any of the holostars make it to the winner's bracket?

9953
06:09:07,060 --> 06:09:09,640
Oh wait, we'll figure that out in three minutes.

9954
06:09:09,960 --> 06:09:11,480
Yeah, we'll figure that out in three minutes.

9955
06:09:11,900 --> 06:09:12,460
Goddamn!

9956
06:09:12,460 --> 06:09:16,660
Because you could be... I don't know if Astel and... I know there's two holostars members, right?

9957
06:09:16,760 --> 06:09:17,180
In there?

9958
06:09:17,520 --> 06:09:18,020
Yeah, yeah.

9959
06:09:18,240 --> 06:09:19,680
Yeah, Fuma and Astel.

9960
06:09:21,120 --> 06:09:22,500
I don't know, did you see Fuma in here?

9961
06:09:23,180 --> 06:09:26,260
No, I was like in streamer mode.

9962
06:09:26,340 --> 06:09:27,780
Everyone was like on default names.

9963
06:09:28,420 --> 06:09:33,640
Wait, I mean, I could literally check if... we'll just check if they're streaming still.

9964
06:09:36,630 --> 06:09:37,070
No!

9965
06:09:38,090 --> 06:09:39,670
Because you could be...

9966
06:09:39,670 --> 06:09:41,770
you made it to winner's bracket.

9967
06:09:41,770 --> 06:09:44,010
Like, just think about that.

9968
06:09:44,550 --> 06:09:46,350
You literally made it to winner's bracket.

9969
06:09:48,250 --> 06:09:51,670
Probably the only holostars that made it to the winner's bracket.

9970
06:09:52,150 --> 06:09:53,330
I don't want to think about that.

9971
06:09:53,450 --> 06:09:54,150
Oh my god!

9972
06:09:56,710 --> 06:09:58,090
You made it...

9973
06:09:58,090 --> 06:09:59,650
Fuma didn't make it to winner's bracket.

9974
06:10:04,250 --> 06:10:05,690
Fuma didn't make it.

9975
06:10:06,110 --> 06:10:08,030
Wait, did Astel not make it too?

9976
06:10:09,110 --> 06:10:10,310
Wait, are you kidding me?

9977
06:10:10,310 --> 06:10:12,490
Wait, no, Astel's not streaming it.

9978
06:10:12,530 --> 06:10:13,770
Astel's not streaming it.

9979
06:10:14,790 --> 06:10:16,110
He didn't stream it.

9980
06:10:16,150 --> 06:10:20,030
I don't know if he streamed it on Twitch, but he streamed a different Apex tournament.

9981
06:10:20,110 --> 06:10:21,110
But you did it!

9982
06:10:21,410 --> 06:10:23,570
As a bronze player!

9983
06:10:24,390 --> 06:10:25,130
That's pretty impressive!

9984
06:10:25,150 --> 06:10:26,270
As a bronze player?

9985
06:10:27,490 --> 06:10:28,790
That's really impressive!

9986
06:10:29,170 --> 06:10:31,250
I think I painted a massive target on my back.

9987
06:10:33,070 --> 06:10:34,590
Like, losing to...

9988
06:10:34,590 --> 06:10:38,450
I don't know, but I have a bad feeling about this.

9989
06:10:40,310 --> 06:10:48,050
I mean, we literally got champions during group A, so...

9990
06:10:48,050 --> 06:10:52,650
I hope they realize that I was only being carried by two of you.

9991
06:10:52,990 --> 06:10:56,130
Like, Flame and you, you guys were carrying the shit out of me.

9992
06:10:56,670 --> 06:10:58,830
Like, I have no part in this.

9993
06:10:59,170 --> 06:11:01,610
If they're gonna be angry at me...

9994
06:11:02,330 --> 06:11:04,530
Fuma-senpai, listen to me!

9995
06:11:05,650 --> 06:11:07,710
She and him were carrying me!

9996
06:11:07,710 --> 06:11:09,210
I'm not the one doing the shots!

9997
06:11:09,630 --> 06:11:11,210
They're literally puppeting me!

9998
06:11:11,570 --> 06:11:12,450
I didn't do anything!

9999
06:11:12,790 --> 06:11:16,410
Like, majority of my plays here are all based on their decisions.

10000
06:11:16,730 --> 06:11:17,970
Not my fault!

10001
06:11:18,650 --> 06:11:19,550
Thank you.

10002
06:11:19,910 --> 06:11:21,370
Thank you very much.

10003
06:11:21,550 --> 06:11:22,530
But not my fault!

10004
06:11:23,990 --> 06:11:27,950
I'm just making a public statement right now before anyone attacks me.

10005
06:11:27,950 --> 06:11:27,950
Oh, we got 15!

10006
06:11:27,950 --> 06:11:28,730
That's not bad!

10007
06:11:31,310 --> 06:11:32,690
That's not bad!

10008
06:11:32,930 --> 06:11:34,630
15 in the winner's bracket!

10009
06:11:35,410 --> 06:11:38,150
Yeah, that's actually pretty decent for winners.

10010
06:11:38,690 --> 06:11:43,250
The only way for us to get top 10 was actually winning that game.

10011
06:11:44,910 --> 06:11:48,390
We actually needed to win that game to get top 10.

10012
06:11:51,610 --> 06:11:57,450
I think it was a very impossible chance because it was literally the last game.

10013
06:11:57,850 --> 06:11:59,150
So everyone had to lock in.

10014
06:11:59,310 --> 06:12:03,410
I mean, we have tomorrow.

10015
06:12:03,710 --> 06:12:04,950
We have tomorrow now.

10016
06:12:05,090 --> 06:12:07,110
Are you excited?

10017
06:12:07,570 --> 06:12:08,790
I think we're going to win a lot tomorrow.

10018
06:12:08,950 --> 06:12:09,610
Are you going to practice?

10019
06:12:10,490 --> 06:12:13,870
Yeah, I'm going to practice literally a lot.

10020
06:12:13,990 --> 06:12:15,590
Are we still going to go with the Rampart build?

10021
06:12:15,870 --> 06:12:17,510
I think Rampart works the best.

10022
06:12:17,690 --> 06:12:18,850
The walls are really good.

10023
06:12:19,290 --> 06:12:21,550
Just figure out Rampart walls.

10024
06:12:23,310 --> 06:12:24,530
Walling is not that hard.

10025
06:12:24,710 --> 06:12:27,550
It's literally just wall the doors and wall our angles.

10026
06:12:28,590 --> 06:12:29,150
Okay.

10027
06:12:29,290 --> 06:12:32,110
I'm going to be watching a bunch of streams and videos.

10028
06:12:32,490 --> 06:12:36,010
The only thing I think you need to improve on is just looting.

10029
06:12:36,490 --> 06:12:38,190
You literally need to loot faster.

10030
06:12:38,930 --> 06:12:42,390
You don't need to stand still when you drop stuff.

10031
06:12:43,070 --> 06:12:44,290
Oh yeah, you're right.

10032
06:12:44,430 --> 06:12:47,070
You can't run when you drop things.

10033
06:12:47,070 --> 06:12:49,250
Running on just general knowledge.

10034
06:12:49,510 --> 06:12:53,850
You can run and then press tab while you're running and drop stuff while you're running.

10035
06:12:54,390 --> 06:12:58,390
I still have this habit of checking death boxes and just standing still.

10036
06:12:58,650 --> 06:12:59,870
You should be strafing, right?

10037
06:12:59,970 --> 06:13:01,390
But I still can't help it.

10038
06:13:01,810 --> 06:13:04,050
I cannot focus at all.

10039
06:13:04,990 --> 06:13:06,290
I guess I have to practice.

10040
06:13:06,450 --> 06:13:08,470
God damn, I have to practice on a bunch of stuff.

10041
06:13:09,150 --> 06:13:13,430
I guess I have to cancel one stream for a tournament.

10042
06:13:13,930 --> 06:13:15,570
Yes, I'm making an army school app.

10043
06:13:15,630 --> 06:13:16,110
I'm sorry.

10044
06:13:16,250 --> 06:13:16,810
I'm gonna...

10045
06:13:16,810 --> 06:13:17,590
No!

10046
06:13:17,590 --> 06:13:18,790
Don't cancel the army!

10047
06:13:20,490 --> 06:13:21,450
I'm sorry.

10048
06:13:21,590 --> 06:13:22,450
They should understand.

10049
06:13:22,750 --> 06:13:25,310
What's a fake here is way more important.

10050
06:13:25,410 --> 06:13:26,890
No, I'm not responsible for this.

10051
06:13:27,330 --> 06:13:31,070
I'm begging him to not cancel the armist collab.

10052
06:13:32,250 --> 06:13:33,290
They understand.

10053
06:13:33,610 --> 06:13:34,090
I'm their leader.

10054
06:13:35,370 --> 06:13:37,190
Don't cancel the armist collab.

10055
06:13:37,390 --> 06:13:38,550
You can fit too.

10056
06:13:38,670 --> 06:13:40,090
Yes, you are not a part of this.

10057
06:13:40,210 --> 06:13:41,730
This is my executive decision.

10058
06:13:41,970 --> 06:13:44,010
At least make them play Apex with you.

10059
06:13:44,150 --> 06:13:46,770
Just make them play Apex with you.

10060
06:13:50,870 --> 06:13:51,830
I will...

10061
06:13:51,830 --> 06:13:55,170
No, because there's only three and I don't want to exclude one more.

10062
06:13:55,310 --> 06:13:56,930
Wait, Astel didn't make it to the winners.

10063
06:13:58,350 --> 06:13:58,830
What?

10064
06:13:59,190 --> 06:14:00,510
He didn't make it to the winners.

10065
06:14:01,110 --> 06:14:01,790
Wait, really?

10066
06:14:01,970 --> 06:14:03,590
So he's gonna be in the elimination bracket.

10067
06:14:04,490 --> 06:14:05,590
Oh, shit!

10068
06:14:06,210 --> 06:14:09,890
So you're literally the only holostars that made it to the winners bracket.

10069
06:14:10,670 --> 06:14:12,010
I was scared so hard!

10070
06:14:12,130 --> 06:14:12,890
What the fuck?

10071
06:14:13,070 --> 06:14:14,770
You actually made it!

10072
06:14:14,770 --> 06:14:16,510
I made it!

10073
06:14:16,930 --> 06:14:18,070
We made it!

10074
06:14:18,130 --> 06:14:18,650
Not me!

10075
06:14:18,730 --> 06:14:19,950
We made it!

10076
06:14:21,110 --> 06:14:22,230
But we have to do this again.

10077
06:14:23,250 --> 06:14:24,430
We have to do it again though.

10078
06:14:24,470 --> 06:14:25,370
How heavy was I?

10079
06:14:26,190 --> 06:14:27,710
On a scale of 1 to 10, how heavy was I?

10080
06:14:28,010 --> 06:14:29,210
No, you were doing your learning.

10081
06:14:29,530 --> 06:14:33,570
The first two games was rough.

10082
06:14:33,710 --> 06:14:34,330
It was very rough.

10083
06:14:35,030 --> 06:14:37,870
But then after that you started picking up.

10084
06:14:37,890 --> 06:14:40,030
We really did not have any sort of...

10085
06:14:40,030 --> 06:14:42,090
We don't know the chemistry.

10086
06:14:42,090 --> 06:14:43,950
I was feeling things out.

10087
06:14:44,090 --> 06:14:45,910
How do I play with him?

10088
06:14:46,150 --> 06:14:46,610
Is the thing.

10089
06:14:46,930 --> 06:14:48,930
I only play with casuals.

10090
06:14:49,290 --> 06:14:51,390
All you have to do is just listen.

10091
06:14:51,990 --> 06:14:54,130
You just listen to what he says.

10092
06:14:55,010 --> 06:14:56,330
You don't hesitate.

10093
06:14:56,570 --> 06:14:57,870
You just listen to your IGL.

10094
06:14:58,570 --> 06:14:59,770
Unless you know better than him.

10095
06:14:59,890 --> 06:15:01,190
But I don't know better than him.

10096
06:15:01,270 --> 06:15:02,290
So I'm not fucking gonna argue.

10097
06:15:03,810 --> 06:15:05,630
That's actually good fucking advice.

10098
06:15:06,050 --> 06:15:09,310
He literally has the most knowledge and you literally just listen to what he says.

10099
06:15:09,310 --> 06:15:11,550
Just keep going.

10100
06:15:11,730 --> 06:15:13,510
Just follow his orders.

10101
06:15:15,170 --> 06:15:21,870
You also need to listen to because when we run away you ran into it.

10102
06:15:22,310 --> 06:15:23,070
I mean...

10103
06:15:23,070 --> 06:15:24,370
I mean...

10104
06:15:24,370 --> 06:15:26,310
That was the first one, right?

10105
06:15:26,690 --> 06:15:29,350
And then after that you started listening more.

10106
06:15:29,470 --> 06:15:31,150
You started listening more, which is good.

10107
06:15:32,050 --> 06:15:33,790
Yeah, yeah, which is really nice.

10108
06:15:34,290 --> 06:15:36,870
So I'm gonna be doing exactly all of this.

10109
06:15:36,870 --> 06:15:39,530
I'm gonna accumulate everything that I've learned here.

10110
06:15:39,650 --> 06:15:41,710
And you're not cancelling the Aramis collab.

10111
06:15:42,350 --> 06:15:43,130
I will.

10112
06:15:43,610 --> 06:15:45,330
I need to sleep.

10113
06:15:45,770 --> 06:15:49,990
Yesterday I streamed for 11 hours and after 11 hours I saw your fucking DM.

10114
06:15:50,470 --> 06:15:51,310
Like, you wanna play tomorrow?

10115
06:15:51,650 --> 06:15:52,470
Like, which tomorrow?

10116
06:15:52,590 --> 06:15:53,670
Is it Saturday or Friday?

10117
06:15:54,110 --> 06:15:56,070
Technically it's my tomorrow.

10118
06:15:56,850 --> 06:15:57,910
It's been four hours.

10119
06:15:57,970 --> 06:15:58,510
What the fuck?

10120
06:15:58,790 --> 06:16:00,010
Four hours?!

10121
06:16:00,010 --> 06:16:02,450
You could have said no.

10122
06:16:04,030 --> 06:16:05,770
Because I assume...

10123
06:16:05,770 --> 06:16:07,010
Oh, so Saturday.

10124
06:16:07,410 --> 06:16:07,930
And okay.

10125
06:16:08,150 --> 06:16:10,090
I told you the hours.

10126
06:16:10,250 --> 06:16:11,650
I was like, it's in 14 hours.

10127
06:16:13,470 --> 06:16:18,110
I saw same time and my brain processed like, so 11pm.

10128
06:16:18,250 --> 06:16:19,230
I still have time.

10129
06:16:20,270 --> 06:16:21,770
It's in 14 hours.

10130
06:16:22,110 --> 06:16:24,130
That's like less than 24.

10131
06:16:24,550 --> 06:16:25,930
It's like less than 24.

10132
06:16:28,730 --> 06:16:29,930
Okay, that was my bad.

10133
06:16:29,930 --> 06:16:31,970
Okay, you should go to sleep now.

10134
06:16:32,090 --> 06:16:34,010
You should really go to sleep now.

10135
06:16:34,310 --> 06:16:35,670
Alright, I won't keep you anymore.

10136
06:16:35,850 --> 06:16:36,890
Go to sleep, man.

10137
06:16:37,030 --> 06:16:37,410
GGs.

10138
06:16:37,850 --> 06:16:38,710
Thanks for joining me.

10139
06:16:38,710 --> 06:16:39,810
Thank you for playing with me.

10140
06:16:39,910 --> 06:16:40,970
Thank you.

10141
06:16:41,370 --> 06:16:41,750
Bye.

10142
06:16:44,170 --> 06:16:44,550
Bye.

10143
06:16:49,670 --> 06:16:51,090
This is three minutes.

10144
06:16:51,570 --> 06:16:53,830
So like, I'm gonna call it here, everybody.

10145
06:16:54,330 --> 06:16:55,410
We streamed for six hours today.

10146
06:16:55,530 --> 06:16:56,710
This was supposed to be a rest week.

10147
06:16:56,710 --> 06:17:05,310
But tomorrow, we'll be back with more ASGS, which is basically ALGS for VTubers and others.

10148
06:17:10,410 --> 06:17:12,370
I had a great time.

10149
06:17:12,470 --> 06:17:15,010
It was great playing with Flame and Gerard.

10150
06:17:15,050 --> 06:17:17,390
It was my first time playing games with them.

10151
06:17:17,690 --> 06:17:19,350
Well, it was my first time actually meeting Flame.

10152
06:17:19,610 --> 06:17:21,010
I've always wanted to play with Flame.

10153
06:17:21,270 --> 06:17:27,370
Ever since I watched the ALGS and how well his team did.

10154
06:17:27,950 --> 06:17:31,850
And I know a lot of people were super impressed with his team back then.

10155
06:17:32,310 --> 06:17:34,750
And I've always wanted to play with Flame a long time ago.

10156
06:17:35,130 --> 06:17:36,450
During the before times.

10157
06:17:36,950 --> 06:17:45,210
And I was so happy that Flame was super down playing with me.

10158
06:17:45,930 --> 06:17:52,170
And you guys didn't know, Tenjin was originally supposed to be part of my team before my points got recalculated.

10159
06:17:52,930 --> 06:17:54,370
Because my team was too good.

10160
06:17:54,370 --> 06:18:00,210
So because of that my points were considered still pred level.

10161
06:18:00,930 --> 06:18:03,450
Even though I was like, I haven't been pred for 4 years.

10162
06:18:03,830 --> 06:18:10,330
I think it's also because I was bragging about how I got top 500 in Marvel Rivals.

10163
06:18:10,810 --> 06:18:11,890
So he took that too.

10164
06:18:12,230 --> 06:18:13,310
I think they saw that too.

10165
06:18:13,430 --> 06:18:16,910
And was like, oh she clearly still has the FPS skills.

10166
06:18:17,970 --> 06:18:23,450
So my points got re-evaluated and everything to be a lot higher.

10167
06:18:24,010 --> 06:18:29,610
So I couldn't get Tenjin because he got his diamond and our point threshold was gold and under.

10168
06:18:30,110 --> 06:18:33,750
I could not find literally could not find silver or gold players.

10169
06:18:34,430 --> 06:18:36,390
Silver or gold players.

10170
06:18:36,550 --> 06:18:51,570
It was either a player that's never played before or like players who are at best the lowest I could find was plat and bronze.

10171
06:18:51,810 --> 06:18:53,250
It was plat or bronze.

10172
06:18:53,690 --> 06:18:55,830
And I literally could not find anybody.

10173
06:18:56,110 --> 06:18:57,470
So that's why I didn't open call.

10174
06:18:58,010 --> 06:19:01,870
And then somebody in chat, I saw someone reply and was like, you should totally get Jirard.

10175
06:19:02,130 --> 06:19:06,010
And I was like, oh my god, what a great, I should ask Jirard.

10176
06:19:06,370 --> 06:19:13,610
Because I've asked so many people and Jirard never came up to me because I never had an actual collab with Jirard before, other than like WrestleTuber.

10177
06:19:14,230 --> 06:19:16,250
And so I was like, oh my god that's a great idea.

10178
06:19:16,330 --> 06:19:19,050
He was really funny during the Apex custom.

10179
06:19:19,310 --> 06:19:24,390
I thought that like, you know, as a tournament, that's more of like for fun and just like fucking around type deal.

10180
06:19:25,770 --> 06:19:29,150
Oh wait, not fucking around, but to like make it so it's not that serious.

10181
06:19:29,290 --> 06:19:30,870
Like, I know it's a serious tournament.

10182
06:19:31,010 --> 06:19:40,090
I mean, we totally got top five, even though like with it we weren't, we were like, we locked in during when it matters, but it was more so like you we lock in and have fun at the same time.

10183
06:19:40,490 --> 06:19:47,550
So like, my goal was to make sure it's like, you know, fun but also serious too when it needed to be.

10184
06:19:47,610 --> 06:19:53,290
Because I didn't want to be like super duper duper serious and also I couldn't fucking find a player that's silver or gold.

10185
06:19:55,210 --> 06:20:23,650
And I'm pretty sure if I had a gold player like mechanically gold player especially like, oh my god, especially when season whatever that season was that inflated everybody's SR like that inflated everybody's RP, like it was almost, it was impossible finding an actual mechanical gold player like that I know of like so he shouted to Gerard for willing to step up very last minute.

10186
06:20:23,850 --> 06:20:32,810
I was like are you even allowed to like join this tournament within, with like, you know like 14 hours notice and then he's like yeah, no, it's fine.

10187
06:20:33,130 --> 06:21:00,790
So like he shouted to Gerard for like hopping in super last minute literally like 14 hours before the stream, the tournament was about to start and just like playing with us and he shouted straight flame for being my IGL and just like holding our hands and telling us what to do I like that actually helped a lot really good IGL,

10188
06:21:00,930 --> 06:21:22,550
he's an incredible IGL which is why I literally was like cause like it was either like cause I I had to make a really tough choice of either replacing Flame or replacing Tenjin and like it was, I was like I wanted to have an IGL because I am like hopeless without an IGL and like I told Tenjin,

10189
06:21:23,070 --> 06:21:27,550
if I have another tournament invite, like I will get him in there and then I

10190
06:21:31,250 --> 06:22:06,890
so so like cause like obviously I can get tournament I can try and get another tournament invite in and so so so like I had to go with an IGL because like I don't know what to do without an IGL I'm so fucking lost and I know this is like a super serious tournament as well so like so like you know We did our best and we did really well.

10191
06:22:07,050 --> 06:22:10,350
I was very happy with how well we did.

10192
06:22:11,050 --> 06:22:17,510
I never really expected to get into winner's bracket, so I'm super happy that we did get into the winner's bracket there.

10193
06:22:21,270 --> 06:22:30,590
Gerard's literally playing with 300 ping and same with... Gerard's playing with 300 ping and same with Flame apparently sometimes.

10194
06:22:33,630 --> 06:22:38,250
So I was just like, oh my god, how did we make it this far?

10195
06:22:41,010 --> 06:22:43,810
Literally, the times we died was just unlucky.

10196
06:22:44,230 --> 06:22:45,170
Unlucky timing.

10197
06:22:45,370 --> 06:22:46,290
We literally got timed.

10198
06:22:46,610 --> 06:22:50,810
Valorant, when you get timing, we literally just got timed because of it.

10199
06:22:51,570 --> 06:23:00,110
I'm just really happy that despite so many odds against us, we were still able to do so well.

10200
06:23:00,110 --> 06:23:01,710
Anyway, thank you so much for the support.

10201
06:23:01,990 --> 06:23:04,210
That is my reflection of today.

10202
06:23:05,730 --> 06:23:09,190
I originally was actually not going to be in the Sloppy Sisters collab.

10203
06:23:09,650 --> 06:23:16,750
I didn't see the group message because I was in my semi-break, so I was not catching up on my messages or anything.

10204
06:23:17,350 --> 06:23:19,230
I saw it super last minute yesterday.

10205
06:23:19,570 --> 06:23:26,230
I thought I couldn't do it because I was like, oh man, I'm really tired.

10206
06:23:26,870 --> 06:23:33,310
I'm going to still show up for the Sloppy Sisters collab because I thought I had a convention today, too.

10207
06:23:35,230 --> 06:23:39,750
Also, Tempo, you are not a gold... I know you're masters.

10208
06:23:40,210 --> 06:23:43,570
I know you're fucking masters, Tempo.

10209
06:23:43,930 --> 06:23:47,030
Also, bro, international scrims are out.

10210
06:23:47,110 --> 06:23:50,130
Flame literally left to go to international scrims.

10211
06:23:50,190 --> 06:23:50,870
What the fuck?

10212
06:23:53,270 --> 06:23:56,910
I literally saw that message from Flame where he's like, I'm the gold player.

10213
06:23:57,090 --> 06:24:02,830
I literally saw your fucking ranking stream where you're trying to get to a masters in 24 hours.

10214
06:24:07,830 --> 06:24:09,050
Shit, where was I?

10215
06:24:09,170 --> 06:24:13,770
Oh my god, it's a three minute delay, so I'll never know where I was at in the conversation.

10216
06:24:14,490 --> 06:24:15,410
I'll never know.

10217
06:24:16,690 --> 06:24:23,190
Oh yeah, so I thought it was just too much because I thought I had a convention right after, but I think it'll be fine.

10218
06:24:23,370 --> 06:24:32,890
I thought it was a convention on the same day, but it should be fine because my convention is actually on...

10219
06:24:34,070 --> 06:24:41,410
I'm going to be at Holiday Matsuri tomorrow on the 21st, so I have a meet and greet and a panel, so that's going to be on the 21st.

10220
06:24:43,130 --> 06:24:53,970
And Friday I'll be at the Sloppy Sisters collab, and then I'm going to sleep or play Marvel Rivals, depending on how fucked up I am mentally regarding my addiction.

10221
06:24:57,550 --> 06:25:02,030
It just depends on how it's going to go later today.

10222
06:25:02,030 --> 06:25:17,470
And then after that, we go straight to... we go to sleep before the turn... oh, I mean it's at 3.

10223
06:25:18,250 --> 06:25:19,790
Day 2 is at 3.

10224
06:25:19,930 --> 06:25:23,610
Elimination round is at 3am PST, I believe.

10225
06:25:23,830 --> 06:25:24,470
Let me double check.

10226
06:25:24,570 --> 06:25:25,370
I think it is.

10227
06:25:25,450 --> 06:25:27,350
I have to look at the scheduling again.

10228
06:25:30,350 --> 06:25:38,910
Yeah, it's at 3.30am PST, so we're just going to be there at 3.30am PST for tomorrow.

10229
06:25:39,570 --> 06:25:54,990
And then after that, it's Sloppy Sisters collab, rest, 3.30am tournament, Holiday Matsuri stuff, and then we make it to the finals, and I guess more Apex.

10230
06:25:55,990 --> 06:25:58,830
Oh my god, remember when I said I was going to take a break?

10231
06:25:59,170 --> 06:26:00,690
Well then, whoa!

10232
06:26:01,930 --> 06:26:09,350
But yeah, like I said, I didn't realize that Mint asked for a collab until the day before the collab was going to start.

10233
06:26:09,830 --> 06:26:12,690
And then I was like, guys, I'm so sorry.

10234
06:26:12,730 --> 06:26:14,130
I just saw this message.

10235
06:26:14,570 --> 06:26:15,650
I don't think I can make it.

10236
06:26:15,670 --> 06:26:16,550
But I can make it now.

10237
06:26:16,590 --> 06:26:18,630
I can make it now because it's not as bad as I thought.

10238
06:26:18,630 --> 06:26:28,010
I was like, I have to do a convention right after and then back to the tournament, but now it's like tournament, collab, tournament, convention.

10239
06:26:28,570 --> 06:26:29,610
Tournament, we make it.

10240
06:26:29,670 --> 06:26:31,010
If we don't, then that's fine.

10241
06:26:31,150 --> 06:26:37,870
Anyway, as always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing, and if you're up for me, head to bed because you deserve it.

10242
06:26:38,010 --> 06:26:39,090
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

10243
06:26:39,490 --> 06:26:40,170
Bye, guys.

10244
06:26:40,530 --> 06:26:47,370
Also, yeah, before I say bye, if you guys didn't know, there is Phantom Thief concert merch is up for pre-orders.

10245
06:26:47,870 --> 06:26:55,770
And my mods can put those links there when I say this because it's going to be so weird when I post a link to the Phantom Thief pre-order merch, concert merch.

10246
06:26:56,150 --> 06:26:58,730
So even if you guys didn't go to the concert, you can still grab the merch.

10247
06:26:58,930 --> 06:27:05,030
I just thought it was weird that... I thought it was weird if I post it now and then you're going to be like, what's the fucking context?

10248
06:27:05,390 --> 06:27:08,210
And then so my mods can post a link for me when I say this.

10249
06:27:08,210 --> 06:27:09,770
Anyway, guys, bye, everybody.

10250
06:27:10,170 --> 06:27:10,670
Bye.
