It's a two hour nap.

11
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,420
You're supposed to only take like a 30 minute nap.

00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,300
Hold on, I'm cranky right now.

I'm just trying to, I don't know why.

25
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:13,000
Okay, I'm trying to make, like, Mimi's Fuggy to work, but she doesn't, like, Fuggy refuses to, like, make her appear on my screen.

26
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,140
Wait, I thought I was the one not appearing.

27
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,380
No, you're, you're on, you know, like, when you post the Fuggy link, and then, like, she doesn't, they don't show up.

28
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,400
Like, I'm not coming.

29
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:56,320

30
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:56,980
Yeah, exactly.

31
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,960
It's funnier like that.

32
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,960
Okay, guys, I'm still trying to get me on to onto my screen.

33
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,420
Do you want a PNG or something?

34
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,440
Okay, I got her in.

35
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,080
Okay, I had to, like, make a new source file.

36
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,660
I think it's more fault, Doki.

37
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,880
How is it my fault?

38
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,860
I still haven't given you guys little hats, though.

39
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,880
I have, like, four ears because your ears are so big.

40
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,400
I can't cover them without making me impossibly huge.

41
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,980
So now I have like ferret ears and cat ears sticking out from my bloodline.

42
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,260
All right.

43
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,680
That's the new meta.

44
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:28,820
That's the new meta.

45
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,040
Everyone becomes a cat girl.

46
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:30,800
Oh, yeah.

47
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:31,840
Yeah, man.

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,560
We want to explain the game we were originally going to play.

49
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,120
You know how people thought we were going to do a severance watch a party?

50
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,380
Like what?

51
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,760
That's what they thought.

52
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,260
Yeah.

53
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,560
People were like, wow, are you doing a watch party?

54
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:42,980
Yeah.

55
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,500
We're going to do a watch party severance or some shit.

56
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:47,660
Yeah, man.

57
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,860
No, it was a game.

58
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,540
It was a game where it's literally phasmophobia, but someone can play as the ghost.

59
00:04:54,980 --> 00:05:54,160
from like the dev and it seems like they were like people were like they should add this to Phasmophobia and they were like I already try to tell them to add this and they said they'll never do it we'll never do it that's like crazy I was like oh well that seems kind of silly so now we're back in the kitchen yeah and then they seemed like they had their shit together until like you know like i was gonna fucking download the game like two days before and then i was like why does this just say 2025 like what what do you mean it is 20 i know i was just you know but you know how it's supposed to give you like the date of like um of when it's gonna show up so i just got so confused i was like wait did it not tell us the release date why the fuck did we organize this collab on saturday No,

00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:54,940
there is, yeah.

61
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,440
It was a release date.

62
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,600
It disappeared.

63
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,340
He posted an update.

64
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,820
It was like something, there was like a, some bug with his build and so the scheme rejected it.

65
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:06,240
Yeah.

66
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:14,960
Like I had to look it up on, because I was like trying to find like Dev's fucking social media platform and his only social media platform was TikTok for some reason.

67
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,600
I had to link to TikTok.

68
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,580

97
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,240
She doesn't want people to know she's playing Ork Massage.

98
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,460
Sometimes I hear that Mint plays V-bridger.

99
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,280
What a freak.

100
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,680
Oh, my God.

101
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,820
Maybe that's what...

102
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,480
Why did...

103
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,420
I'm going to un...

00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,560
My profile.

00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:46,920
Friends only...

Yeah, yeah.

109
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,120
I think it's regular.

110
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,860
I think it's not Push-To-Talk and then you can activate Push-To-Talk.

111
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,740
Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying.

112
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,760
You can take Push-To-Talk if you want to.

113
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:58,460
Alright.

114
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,400
How do you then, like, what's the button for Push-To-Talk?

115
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,160
Let's go find out.

116
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,400

124
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,440

Oh, we didn't even just said you're in V Bridger.

129
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,080
We can't join.

130
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,380
Oh, no.

131
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,460
Wait, what do I do?

132
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,340
Wait, I'm looking at Browse Games, and I don't even see your lobby.

133
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,080
Usually you have to like...

134
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,060
Because I turned it in by...

135
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,040
I'll leave it.

136
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,480

Oh, my God.

142
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,940
Why would you think I don't have friends?

143
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,100
No, I didn't say...

144
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,880
I didn't think you.

145
00:10:48,540 --> 00:11:12,560
you guys can probably find me searching for games no games found searching for a game is it because you said me too uh what you can do is if you add vbridger to your private games on steam it won't show people you're playing it which oh my god you're so smart how do you do that you right

00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,740

156
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,300
All right.

157
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,820
Now no one will ever know.

158
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,280
No one will know.

159
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,720
This is where we have to like actually restart because it still says you're playing V Bridger.

160
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:46,920
But yeah, you got to restart.

161
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:47,900
Uh-oh.

162
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,400
I have to restart.

163
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,360
Let me see.

164
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,000
Maybe Lyme should be the regional manager.

165
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,720
I think Lyme is way more capable than me.

166
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,620
How much like ping do you really need to play this game?

167
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,340
It'll be fine.

168
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,260
We're fucking flipping burgers.

169
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,920
I'm going to leave the lobby.

170
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:02,500
Yeah.

171
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,600
Okay.

172
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,020
All right.

173
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,700
Now we're just out of wait for Lyme.

174
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,020
This is very lethal coded.

175
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,020
I'm going to say.

176
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:11,560
It is.

177
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,380
It says like.

178
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,180
Rent is due in three days.

179
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,660
Oh, that's very lethal.

180
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,800
You know how I found this game?

181
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,440
You know how?

182
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:23,820
I mean, I found this game because there's like less than 70 reviews or some shit.

183
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,720
Oh, look, I can join Limeo.

184
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,460
I like...

185
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,400
Oh, someone needs to invite Numi because we're not official friends.

186
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:30,980
All right.

187
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,800
Drama exposed.

188
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,340

00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,920
What happened to me?

283
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,240
Betrayed you again.

00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,620
What happened?

287
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,300
Maybe it's only once.

288
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,840
Why did you all the way up there?

289
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,040
Wait, wait, wait.

290
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,840

You go.

292
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,340
You go do it.

293
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,000
It's nothing.

294
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:25,760
Try it again.

295
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,760
Yeah, try it again.

296
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,700
Okay, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary.

297
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,200
And then I just turned around and there was like somebody in the hallway and you think killed me.

298
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:35,440
Oh.

299
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:36,920
Bloody Mary.

300
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:44,500
Wait, do you think it was, do you think it was just a regular customer that came into the hallway and just killed us?

301
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,360
Because we weren't.

302
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,460
It was my box.

303
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,220
You knew I was buying time in the back.

304
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,580
You guys hit the blowout command.

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,180

307
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,080
Bloody Mary.

308
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,330
Yeah, maybe it's what, yeah, we gotta wait for day two.

00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,550

414
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,580
We're never gonna play this game!

415
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,800
We're just like watch partying.

416
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:34,520
You know what?

417
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,280
We are watch partying severance right now.

418
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,940
We are... This is our watch party.

419
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,680
Oh, I can mute you.

420
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,540

422
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,660
What is that so sad?

423
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:47,720
Really?

424
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,220

425
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,860
Let me cook.

426
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,240
That's like the best day on the job is when you can convince everybody's at their match.

427
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:55,620
Yeah.

428
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,880
I think it's just also...

429
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,740
I think you just up the overall volume and then like turn people down individually.

430
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,800
Oh, yeah, yeah.

431
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,240
Okay, Lymu can turn on the fucking jukebox but not start the day.

432
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:10,560
Like...

433
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,720
Bloody Mary.

434
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,360
Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary.

435
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:16,900
Bloody Mary.

436
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,060
Bloody Mary.

437
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,480
We're gonna be dense.

438
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,780
We're just...

439
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,900
This is our purgatory.

440
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,960
You know, get everyone nice and relaxed for their burgers.

441
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,880
I feel like I should be like, you know, free, like, I don't know, just talking this.

442
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,420
Like, hey.

00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,040

444
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,200

445
00:24:45,000 --> 00:25:01,660

00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,260
Brought us up at all.

449
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,560
They completely forgot.

450
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:24,560
Yeah.

451
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,620
Oh, I need to start the day.

452
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,540
No people don't.

453
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,800
I told her I was doing too sorry.

454
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:30,720
We're in Bergen.

00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:31,360
Okay.

456
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:32,920
What?

457
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,880
I can't hear you anymore, Loki.

458
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,400
Wait, can you not hear me?

459
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,460
I said apply the logo.

460
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,040

461
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,180
Oh, I see the logo.

462
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,580
Wait, that's so good.

463
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,020
Yeah.

464
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,040
Wait, who is so...

465
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,880
Oh my god!

466
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,860
That's not the button!

467
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,040
Oh my god!

468
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,260
Oh thank god!

469
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,580
Just end the day!

470
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,000
Just end the day!

471
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,000
Oh my god!

472
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,740
Wait, I think if they all...

473
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,420
If they all like...

474
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,320
We're not gonna do it...

475
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,060
Kill each other.

476
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:19,440
Oh, horse qu- They all kill each other, then we can come back.

477
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,820
I'm handling a burger by placing a bottom bun on the burger.

478
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,720
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

479
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:23,640
Okay.

480
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,100
Okay, I don't think they're gonna do that.

481
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,160
We're just gonna watch them make a burger, I guess.

482
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:27,820
There we go.

483
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,380
Okay, okay, okay.

484
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,420
Let's just- Finish by adding a top bun and pressing the wrap.

485
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:34,740
Oh, there's a dog!

486
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,860
This is like- This- Oh!

487
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,560
There's the customer!

488
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,360
Oh, shit.

489
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,440
You know what's good for you?

490
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,080
Whoa!

491
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,740
He's so aggressive.

492
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,940
This is our tutorial video, Mint.

493
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,760
We're literally watching our tutorial video.

494
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:50,860
Oh, wait.

495
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,960
Oh, my God.

496
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,300
She didn't stay back.

497
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,060
He warned us he had anger issues.

498
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,740
You should let the customers have his job.

499
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,360
You should let me.

500
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:01,480
Um.

501
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,620
So stay back.

502
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,180
Hello.

503
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,780
Welcome to the purgatory.

504
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,800
Welcome to the purgatory.

505
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,560
Yeah, welcome to the purgatory.

506
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,240
Can I take your order?

507
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,180
Thank you.

508
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:13,520
Thanks.

509
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,840
That was something.

510
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,900
Ben and I were watching all three of you try to start the day.

511
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,260
Right?

512
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,280
We just didn't have an orientation.

513
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,100
But we just didn't have an orientation.

514
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,060
It's not our fault.

515
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,140
Our regional manager didn't give us an orientation.

516
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,040
Yeah.

517
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,720
Exactly.

518
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,200
That's not our fault.

519
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,420
There you go.

520
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,040
Is that guy still just walking around?

521
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,000
Yeah, he is.

522
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,580
I think he's walking around till he gets his burger.

523
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,750
Alright, it's just Lamu left.

524
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,710
Hey, Snuffy, welcome to Burgatory.

525
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,170
Yeah, welcome to Burgatory.

526
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,370
Can we take your order?

527
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:09,410
I thought you guys would come back to life when it started.

528
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:10,010
I'm sorry.

529
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,330
It's okay.

530
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:14,670
Yeah, we come back to life on the next day.

531
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:22,370
so I think Lymu should just die yeah Lymu should just die there's no way she can she's gonna shoot the customer

532
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:45,410
that's not very sloppy of her oh she slipped she slipped on her She slipped on Snuffy's blood.

533
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,110
Hey, Snuffy, okay?

534
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,350
Guys?

535
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:49,830
Hello?

536
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:56,090
It's just self-taking orders.

537
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:59,630
I haven't figured out how to make a burger, man.

538
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:04,030
Which, okay, Glimu is our tutorial.

539
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,370
Yeah, this is our tutorial video.

540
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:10,940
Alright.

541
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,140
Well, the guy she killed, though.

542
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,740
Like, what do you do about it?

543
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,160
Yeah, what do you do about him?

544
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:15,520
Do you just...

545
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,880
You gotta make him a burger.

546
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:22,420
Wait, maybe she can use the customer to make more burger meat.

547
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,100
So we'll never run out of meat.

548
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,520
Oh, yeah.

549
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,380
Yeah, yeah.

550
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,420
We got the meat from the bugs downstairs.

551
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,220
Yeah, yeah.

552
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,700
Let's see.

553
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,040
So we have a box of birds.

554
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,080
Oh, my gosh.

555
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,460
She tripped him.

556
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,300
They can figure out how to make a burger again?

557
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,960
Yeah, she's still trying to figure it out.

558
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,820
She shot a customer, but we don't talk about that.

559
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,240
She shot a customer.

560
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:59,640
all right let's see she's definitely the manager then yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what we cause like i want to talk to your manager and we said limo with a gun

561
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:24,200
wait that's not fish you fucking you they grinded our bodies we're probably dead i haven't figured out how to open the burger box yet there was a rest there was a red part we don't even have bodies, man!

562
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,720
What is this machine?

563
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,860
Get in the fucking tube.

564
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,500
Oh, it's the res, but I think...

565
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,800
It's the res machine.

566
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,800
Maybe there might be a recharge.

567
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,240
Yeah, me too.

568
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,020
We grinded your guys' body and we're going back.

569
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,340
It's like the res cost us money.

570
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,020
We need to never come back.

571
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,220
We need to never come back.

572
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,540
Oh, it costs money to revive.

573
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,100
Yeah, yeah, I saw that.

574
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:59,860
I like how Lima brought Mimi back and she's like, okay, figure out the burgers.

575
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,120
Oh, that's cute.

576
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:04,700
That's cute.

577
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,040
Oh, there's some orders.

578
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,240
Oh, there is.

579
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,120
Yeah.

580
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:12,800
I like how she basically revived Mimi just to delegate her some tasks.

581
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,520
Just like real fast food.

582
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,380
Yeah, just like real fast food.

583
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,020
It seems to be working.

584
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,500
So you know what?

585
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,980
Actually, I'm going to do that.

586
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,340
Who's frying with the meat?

587
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,060
Wait, oh, maybe they're in here.

588
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:26,600
Hold up.

589
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,460
What about in here?

590
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,860
Oh, there's the meat!

591
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:29,740
Oh!

592
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,760
Oh, of course they'd be in the fridge.

593
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,880
What is that?

594
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,240
Customers will get angry?

595
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,640
I wonder if they have like a rage mechanic.

596
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,260
Okay, so one...

597
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,600
I'm going back there to eat some things.

598
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:45,080
Surprise.

599
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:45,980
Okay, great.

600
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,260
Where's my partner?

601
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,780
How do you know when it's done?

602
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:53,980
You just oh, I think I think it changed color, right?

603
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,080
Yeah, it turned like less red

604
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:11,670
All right Patty Patty cake cut Oh, oh, that's so immersive.

605
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:14,890
I love that Yeah, yeah, it did a little beep Oh, really?

606
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:23,230
Alright, so we need someone to do the fries I think Mimi would be perfect for fries and then I can flip the burgers.

607
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,010
What order is it?

608
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,170
Shit, what number is it?

609
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,270
I want to take the order.

610
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,190
Oh, yeah, yeah.

611
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,970
Wait, who's going to be the front?

612
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:31,690
Who's going to be Squidward at the front?

613
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:32,410
No, wait.

614
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,110
What the hell is going to look?

615
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,050
But they all left.

616
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,870
It's right here, man.

617
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:43,510
What is going on with that man?

618
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:45,950
We're never coming back.

619
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:46,970
He's never in the burger machine.

620
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:49,530
It looks like he's like banging his hand on the floor.

621
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:50,910
Like, he's like, oh, darn.

622
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,430
Nimmy's gonna put him in the blender.

623
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:55,490
Wait, is she?

624
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:56,990
Oh my god, she is.

625
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,090
She's putting him in the blender.

626
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,790
We were running out of meat.

627
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,230
Wait, she's gonna revive him.

628
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:04,830
I'll just put the way into the tray.

629
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,550
No, I think she's blending him.

630
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,250
Yeah, I think he's blending him for more meat.

631
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,370
We're running out.

632
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:15,050
Alright, into the blender you go.

633
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:17,530
What did they just...

634
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:20,430
They should just throw themselves into the blender and then end the day.

635
00:33:21,990 --> 00:34:18,670
where do you get the meat from oh it comes from the right side it'll show up see there you go oh it's actually like the cheat code because we don't have to pay for more meat it doesn't we have to pay for the drugs we put them into the blender oh wait that makes so much and then put him in the grinder too yeah exactly unlimited meat oh you can't put it in the fridge unfortunately the words has gotten around that we suck and nobody's coming no our our yelp review the trimming is so pathetic

Is that cheese?

643
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:49,750
It looks like cheese.

644
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,410
I mean, if it's yellow, it's cheese.

645
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:52,730

Looks different to what I had in mind.

685
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,600
You gave it to the wrong person, Mitt.

686
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,780
You had one job.

What's going on?

888
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:15,960
I don't know what's going on.

889
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:16,140
I don't know what's going on.

890
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:16,900
I don't know what's going on.

891
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,600
Wait, someone turned off the gravity.

892
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:20,560
What is going on?

893
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:21,440
There's something out here.

894
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,180
Where's the gravity?

895
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:24,940

902
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:42,510
We all fixed the gravity.

903
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:51,130
This is a little mini-game.

904
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:53,550

908
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:02,900
Did you eat any candy, Snuffy?

909
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,520

Oh, shit.

916
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,280
I'm gonna make meat out of these rats.

917
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:19,340
We did it.

918
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:21,080
We're gonna kill the rats, yeah.

919
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:23,940
Alright, I'm gonna kill this rat.

920
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:27,880
Oh?

921
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,340
Wait, whose body is that?

922
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:33,320
Oh, shit!

923
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:34,360
Wait, it was alive?

924
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:35,940
Ow.

925
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,680
Oh no, I'm one fucking fall away from ending it all.

926
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:42,900
Wait, why is...

927
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,060
Wait, Lyme died.

928
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:46,880
Put her in the chair.

929
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,060
Oh, you're right.

930
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,800
I thought you meant the grinder.

931
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:52,320
Ah!

932
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:56,080
Okay, I'm still okay.

933
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,380
I still have one more trip.

934
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:00,760
Alright.

935
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,780
I have one more trip before it's gone.

936
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:08,450
Yes.

937
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:16,270
Yeah, I think she tripped and she was not okay.

938
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:18,970
Welcome back.

939
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:19,630
What happened?

940
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:22,330
A ghost spawned in the blackout and killed me.

941
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:24,210
A ghost bot?

942
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,860
We gotta get the rat.

943
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:31,420
I'm putting this back.

944
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:32,440

What happened to you leave a bunch of burgers around?

947
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,980

948
00:54:36,980 --> 00:55:33,320
the space rats don't make sense alien rats guys I think we gotta accept our fate I think the manager is gonna come for us now losing money if the fucking customers stop coming after about three minutes yeah I think we gotta work fast I'm pretty sure so we gotta have a healthy stream of customers I think the I think sloppy I think sloppy court's gonna send in a representative and fire us go bankrupt oh you guys are oh oh oh well burger bots incorporated thanks you for your service as per our contract you signed burger bots incorporated is eligible to initiate a self-destruct protocol installed upon the signing of before mentioned contract should one of the following incidents occur oh we're dying one at a time oh that's fucked up

949
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:42,340

00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:46,500
Oh, it's me!

951

01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:02,210
Alright.

1031
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:05,370
Wait, Snuffy, we need more patties.

1032
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:07,170
Can you go kill an ant for us?

1033
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:08,230
Or kill a customer?

1034
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:09,450
It either works.

1035
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:10,970
Kill a customer.

1036
01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:13,590
Wait, I gotta pick up these orders too.

1037
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:14,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah, pick it up.

1038
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:16,870
I'm flipping patties.

1039
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:17,610
Patties, really?

1040
01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:18,210
We're already out?

1041
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:20,110
Yeah, yeah, we're almost out.

1042
01:02:20,810 --> 01:02:22,290
There's two freezer pools worth.

1043
01:02:22,370 --> 01:02:22,670
What do you mean?

1044
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:25,510
No, I only have five patties left.

1045
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:28,570
Have you checked both freezers?

1046
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:30,710
Oh, wait, we have another freezer?

1047
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:36,150
When do we have that?

1048
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:40,270
Oh my god, we have another freezer.

1049
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:43,330
Okay.

1050
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,180
All right.

1051
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,160
I'm cooking more patties.

1052
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:52,920
Order up.

1053
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:53,740
Order up.

1054
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:54,440
What?

1055
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:58,920
Why does that music sound like a...

1056
01:02:58,920 --> 01:02:59,780
Urbanic theme?

1057
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,340
Who's doing...

1058
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:01,620
Is someone doing order number six?

1059
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:03,180
I'll get us the comic cola.

1060
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:05,460
No, no one's doing six.

1061
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:06,680
I'll do six then.

1062
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:07,480
I make cola.

1063
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:07,960
Okay.

1064
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:09,240
I'll do seven.

1065
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:10,400
Is it working?

1066
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:11,840
Oh.

1067
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:14,820
Yay!

1068
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,400
One more more more more more more more more more more more more.

We're recording anything.

1071
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:21,000
All right, I got the soda.

1072
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:22,580
This is the comic soda.

1073
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:24,760
Um...

1074
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:25,740
And then...

1075
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,540
Here's some more fries.

1076
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:32,600
And...

1077
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,160
And...

1078
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,160
And...

1079
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,040
Finding number six?

1080
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:39,760
Oh, I got more orders!

1081
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:43,000
Oh my god, wait, there's so many customers coming in!

1082
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:44,880
We're raking in the dough!

1083
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,340
Wait, I need more patties!

1084
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:48,160
Seven.

1085
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,100
I'm gonna do...

1086
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:51,420
Is someone doing order eight?

1087
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,200
No, it's doing order eight.

1088
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:54,760
I'm just flipping my burgers.

1089
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:55,760
My patties.

1090
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:00,220
You can walk.

1091
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:01,100
You can aura walk.

1092
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,020
Wait, someone get the cola.

1093
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:06,040

1094
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:07,800
Alright.

1095
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:08,740
More patties.

01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:09,740
Order up.

1097
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,100

1099
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:14,640
One pickle.

I got more patties.

1101
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:19,660
I think that's all we need.

1102
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:20,760
Oh my god, look at.

1103
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:22,620

01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:26,380
It's day one.

1106
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,620
We're gonna make so many people happy.

1107
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:31,400
Uh, no, we're not.

1108
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:36,460

01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:37,760
Everyone's so happy.

1110
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:41,160
Sloppy.

1111
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,300

Yeah, yeah, something made...

1113
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:46,340
Our social media manager made a new logo.

1114
01:04:55,470 --> 01:04:57,890
Yeah, I can't believe we would do that.

1115
01:04:58,730 --> 01:05:00,330
Look, you matter, okay?

1116
01:05:00,410 --> 01:05:03,210
Like, even though we're fast food workers, we matter.

1117
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:35,090
I know they just these people have never worked a service job I know They just don't know how to treat anybody Yeah they think just because we're in service That we are lesser than them That's so fucked up It really is man Yeah I think we have a customer I wonder how we keep running I'm gonna get a bunch of rats No no it'll be fun Who cooked all these patties here Okay look no it's fine They only show up on day three.

1118
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:37,250

01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:39,450
They'll show up on day...

1120
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:41,610
Wait, what?

1121
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:43,050
Yeah, you can dispose of them.

1122
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:43,910
Dispose of them.

1123
01:05:44,790 --> 01:05:46,370
No, wait, don't dispose of them.

1124
01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:48,190
The rats aren't even here yet.

1125
01:05:48,310 --> 01:05:48,970
We're fine.

1126
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:52,410
When the rats come.

1127
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:56,610
It's okay.

1128
01:05:56,910 --> 01:05:58,330
The customers don't know.

1129
01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:01,070
Yeah, yeah, they show up on the third day.

1130
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:02,110
The customers don't know.

1131
01:06:02,310 --> 01:06:03,110
It won't hurt them.

1132
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:58,360

No, no, I thought he was also dead.

1135
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,300
I thought you got a double kill.

1136
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:06,560
Is there any more?

1137
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,200
Yeah, there's another ant there.

1138
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:14,300
All right, I'll put the patty box in the patty fridge.

1139
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:25,360
All right, patty in the patty fridge.

1140
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:26,580
Maybe the computer.

1141
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,440
Patty in the patty fridge.

1142
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:31,120
Oh, nice.

1143
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:32,880
Oh, it just fills up one box.

1144
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:33,700
box only.

1145
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,260
I don't know if we can, like, pre-make cola.

1146
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,700
Yeah, but rats aren't gonna drink.

1147
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:43,820
They only eat.

1148
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,860
Yeah, we need more patties.

1149
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:47,840
We're running out.

1150
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,300
I'll change the track.

1151
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:54,020
Oh, it's just there's just one track.

1152
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:56,140
And it's only alien to skill.

1153
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:58,880
That's okay, I guess.

1154
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:01,940
That's all we need.

1155
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:04,400
Alien the skill.

1156
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:11,200
That's all we need in the world.

1157
01:08:18,590 --> 01:08:19,130

01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:41,640
That's basic kitchen 101.

1291
01:17:41,980 --> 01:17:42,880
There's no 22.

1292
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:43,780
What are you doing?

1293
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:47,860
I didn't realize there was a man above me.

1294
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:51,580
Okay, well, they're just like, all right, 23.

1295
01:17:52,220 --> 01:17:53,080

Okay, I get it.

1298
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:03,080
But Nimi and Stuffy can die twice.

Okay, I'm fine.

1303
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:08,460
Oh my.

1304
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:10,740
They used up everyone's...

1305
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:12,980
The dresses are shared in the company.

1306
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:15,420
The show must go on.

1307
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:17,120
You're right.

1308
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:21,680
They gotta save money.

1309
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:24,820
I didn't realize vacation days are shared.

1310
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:27,120
Like...

1311
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,460

You can't go home.

1329
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:23,650
Two patties, two lettuce for 26.

Wait, why did it laugh evilly?

01:20:26,610 --> 01:20:27,450
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1347
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:28,610
I had a really bad trip.

1348
01:20:28,830 --> 01:20:29,830
There was a monster in the vent.

1349
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:32,990
You had to, like, look for the goo drops and then shoot the vent that it was in.

1350
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:33,490
Oh.

1351
01:20:33,970 --> 01:20:34,390
I said that.

1352
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:37,770
I said, like, a million times to walk under the vents because there's half like one.

1353
01:20:38,890 --> 01:20:40,090
Might be with the other.

1354
01:20:40,790 --> 01:20:41,850
Wait, what the fuck?

1355
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:43,330
What the fuck did I eat?

1356
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:45,630
Oh, they're worried we're gonna run out.

1357
01:20:45,950 --> 01:20:46,330
Hold on.

1358
01:20:46,410 --> 01:20:48,630
Well, I'll make some more patties.

1359
01:20:48,650 --> 01:20:49,690
Because we're basically out.

1360
01:20:51,370 --> 01:20:53,090
Wait, did we stop the day already?

1361
01:20:54,030 --> 01:20:54,970
Oh, it is close.

1362
01:20:55,030 --> 01:20:56,230
Are you guys ready to start the day?

1363
01:20:57,390 --> 01:20:58,450
No, no, no, no, no.

1364
01:20:59,490 --> 01:21:03,150
Wait, I'll make more soda.

1365
01:21:03,290 --> 01:21:03,510
Oh, wait.

1366
01:21:03,710 --> 01:21:05,030
The soda machine stops, too.

1367
01:21:05,550 --> 01:21:06,710
Wait, what do we need left?

1368
01:21:08,390 --> 01:21:08,770
No, no, no.

1369
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:12,190
It stops when the day is closed, when the restaurant's closed.

1370
01:21:12,530 --> 01:21:13,190
We're going to need more.

1371
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:14,730
Are you so tired of hearing?

1372
01:21:15,530 --> 01:21:16,250
Oh, no, never mind.

1373
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:16,770
I'm good.

1374
01:21:17,370 --> 01:21:19,590
Okay, we need more pickles and lettuce.

1375
01:21:21,850 --> 01:21:23,330
Oh, we can order those online.

1376
01:21:23,890 --> 01:21:24,850

1437
01:27:22,740 --> 01:27:23,940
Where did that guy come from?

1438
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:25,840
He was right next to me.

1439
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,500
Oh, what is that?

1440
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:29,920
I'm working on nothing.

1441
01:27:30,140 --> 01:27:31,660
I just did 33.

1442
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:34,120
This is 32.

1443
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:35,400
I'm gonna get my fries.

1444
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:38,540
Someone do 29, please.

1445
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:39,680
I wasn't doing 20.

1446
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:43,040
I'll say, okay, it's one patty, one lettuce, and one tomato.

1447
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:46,040
One patty, one lettuce, one tomato.

1448
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:48,680
Oh, oh no.

1449
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:49,860
Oh no.

1450
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:51,280

1451
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:52,180
Okay, it's fine.

1452
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:53,020
Don't worry, customers.

1453
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:54,140
Just a little oopsie.

1454
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:55,480
We'll fix it soon.

1455
01:27:57,780 --> 01:27:58,640
I got the battery.

1456
01:27:59,440 --> 01:27:59,840
Woo.

1457
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:02,420
Oh, that's cute.

1458
01:28:05,690 --> 01:28:06,090
Alright.

1459
01:28:07,890 --> 01:28:08,370
I'm fine.

1460
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:08,910
Sorry.

1461
01:28:09,110 --> 01:28:10,310
Go back to your seats, please.

1462
01:28:10,470 --> 01:28:11,570
That was just, that was an event.

1463
01:28:12,510 --> 01:28:14,090
We are not getting 29.

1464
01:28:14,310 --> 01:28:15,150
Yeah, we're not getting 29.

1465
01:28:15,450 --> 01:28:17,570
34 is three patties, one pickle.

1466
01:28:18,030 --> 01:28:19,810
Is someone doing 34, shall I?

1467
01:28:20,090 --> 01:28:21,050
I think you're doing it.

1468
01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:21,910
I'm thinking patties.

1469
01:28:21,990 --> 01:28:22,490
Okay.

1470
01:28:22,790 --> 01:28:24,770
Oh, 29 is about to be over.

1471
01:28:24,910 --> 01:28:25,230
Oh, no.

1472
01:28:25,390 --> 01:28:26,370
Yeah, I don't think we made it.

1473
01:28:26,490 --> 01:28:27,310
I don't think we make it.

1474
01:28:29,710 --> 01:28:31,410
I'm currently making order 34.

1475
01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:33,830
I'm flipping patties.

1476
01:28:34,890 --> 01:28:36,370
Remember, don't walk on to the fence.

1477
01:28:36,670 --> 01:28:37,290
Double check the fence.

1478
01:28:37,510 --> 01:28:39,450
Okay, 34 is covered.

1479
01:28:39,710 --> 01:28:40,770
Yeah, 35 is covered.

1480
01:28:43,270 --> 01:28:44,670
I'm doing patties.

1481
01:28:44,830 --> 01:28:46,150
I'm working so hard.

1482
01:28:47,310 --> 01:28:47,750
Oh, no.

1483
01:28:48,070 --> 01:28:48,770
Oh, no.

1484
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:50,530
No, not the power.

1485
01:28:52,490 --> 01:28:55,270
Guys, I can't flip patties with no power!

1486
01:28:56,470 --> 01:28:58,610
We can't even work!

1487
01:28:59,830 --> 01:29:00,490
Sir, please.

1488
01:29:01,070 --> 01:29:01,870
No, don't leave!

1489
01:29:01,950 --> 01:29:02,330
Don't leave!

1490
01:29:02,470 --> 01:29:03,790
The power's coming back, please!

1491
01:29:04,270 --> 01:29:05,790
Okay, well, one guy left.

1492
01:29:06,850 --> 01:29:07,990
I'll do 36!

1493
01:29:08,330 --> 01:29:09,310
Someone do 35!

1494
01:29:10,230 --> 01:29:10,930
I got 35!

1495
01:29:11,150 --> 01:29:11,750
Okay, okay.

1496
01:29:12,110 --> 01:29:13,510
I'm on 36, I'm on 36!

1497
01:29:13,670 --> 01:29:15,270
I'm cooking as much patties as I can!

1498
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:16,150
I'll get 37!

1499
01:29:18,030 --> 01:29:18,330
Less?

1500
01:29:18,690 --> 01:29:19,290
38 then.

1501
01:29:20,350 --> 01:29:20,910
Uh...

1502
01:29:20,910 --> 01:29:21,590
37.

1503
01:29:21,910 --> 01:29:21,970
Yeah.

1504
01:29:21,990 --> 01:29:22,590
It is.

1505
01:29:22,650 --> 01:29:23,890
One burger, one cheese, two pickles.

1506
01:29:24,950 --> 01:29:27,110
I'm flipping as hard fast as I can, guys.

1507
01:29:27,330 --> 01:29:28,770
Good life.

1508
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:31,550
Which one's done?

1509
01:29:35,050 --> 01:29:35,450
Oh.

1510
01:29:36,850 --> 01:29:37,850
Oh, I'm hunting.

1511
01:29:39,710 --> 01:29:40,630
Oh, someone's air.

1512
01:29:40,730 --> 01:29:41,750
Oh, I see him.

1513
01:29:41,830 --> 01:29:42,390
He's upset.

1514
01:29:43,290 --> 01:29:44,270
Getting the gun, getting the gun.

1515
01:29:44,290 --> 01:29:45,410
He's just running around.

1516
01:29:46,110 --> 01:29:47,330
Like he owns the place.

1517
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:51,560
It's okay.

1518
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:52,280
I'm still flipping.

1519
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:57,060
Oh, the way I'm still flipping burgers.

1520
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:59,820
Oh, he's doing a little dance.

1521
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:02,820
Okay, it's fine.

1522
01:30:02,980 --> 01:30:03,700
I still flipped it.

1523
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:14,800
Hey, guys, we need a...

1524
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:18,900
We need to mop up this blood that's on next to my stove.

1525
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:21,060
Oh, my God, he just dropped the fucking...

1526
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:21,700
I got a rat.

1527
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:24,380
Oh, shit.

1528
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:26,240
I thought he was so alive.

1529
01:30:27,740 --> 01:30:28,120
Oh!

1530
01:30:28,460 --> 01:30:29,480
The other six freaked out and left.

1531
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:30,540
You gotta kill it, I think.

1532
01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:31,020
Okay.

1533
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:32,260
Okay, I have...

1534
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:33,360
The rat.

1535
01:30:34,340 --> 01:30:35,860
They're taking my patties.

1536
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:36,700
How do I...

1537
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:38,820
I dispose the rat.

1538
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:40,360
What do you mean by the worry?

1539
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:43,020
Who is that?

1540
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:44,920
Who is blue and walking around really slow?

1541
01:30:44,980 --> 01:30:45,580
That's suspicious.

1542
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:46,500
That's me.

1543
01:30:47,740 --> 01:30:48,420
Oh, okay.

1544
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:50,000
Okay, that's just me.

1545
01:30:50,140 --> 01:30:50,920
You were suspicious.

1546
01:30:51,740 --> 01:30:51,920

Oh, my two!

1874
01:56:35,290 --> 01:56:40,150

1875
01:56:43,650 --> 01:56:46,230
Wait, but is Is Nimi still alive?

1876

Wait, I don't know if Nimi...

1878
01:56:52,010 --> 01:56:53,350

1886
01:57:10,850 --> 01:57:11,710
He's still out there.

1887
01:57:11,990 --> 01:57:13,090
I don't think we can kill him.

1888

Wait, is that the imposter?

1901

What the flipping?

1902
01:58:23,010 --> 01:58:26,110
Wait, wait, we just walked past the imposter.

1903
01:58:38,620 --> 01:58:38,700
What?

1904
01:58:42,440 --> 01:58:44,780
What is the night before you do the pumpkin?

1905
01:58:44,900 --> 01:58:47,100
You need to sit here for five seconds.

1906
01:58:47,980 --> 01:58:48,680
Wait, come on.

1907
01:58:50,440 --> 01:58:52,180
Oh, wait, there's my dog.

1908
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:53,520
I will feed my dog.

1909
01:59:14,830 --> 01:59:16,350
Oh my god.

1910
01:59:17,250 --> 01:59:19,150
Wait, how did you die, Snuffy?

1911
01:59:19,990 --> 01:59:21,050
There was an imposter.

1912
01:59:22,590 --> 01:59:24,250
Oh, so it was the mimic that got you.

1913
01:59:24,690 --> 01:59:25,010
Yeah.

1914
01:59:26,090 --> 01:59:28,610
Someone is still able to move around.

1915
01:59:29,030 --> 01:59:30,690
Did we all die to the imposter?

1916
01:59:32,150 --> 01:59:32,590
Yes.

1917
01:59:32,810 --> 01:59:35,510
No, there was a fucking sniper in the bed.

1918
01:59:35,830 --> 01:59:37,130
There was a sniper?

1919
01:59:37,650 --> 01:59:38,670
There was a sniper.

1920
01:59:39,350 --> 01:59:39,770
Oh.

1921
01:59:45,770 --> 01:59:48,130
Maybe we should have just paid our rent.

1922
01:59:48,690 --> 01:59:49,790
We got too greedy.

1923
01:59:50,350 --> 01:59:52,130
We got so greedy.

1924
01:59:54,870 --> 01:59:59,150
I think we learned our lesson.

1925
01:59:59,330 --> 01:59:59,830
I think we can do.

1926
01:59:59,910 --> 02:00:01,410
I think we can make it.

1927
02:00:01,750 --> 02:00:02,670
Okay, we can make it.

1928
02:00:02,810 --> 02:00:03,390
We can make it.

1929
02:00:03,510 --> 02:00:04,210
We can make it.

1930
02:00:04,990 --> 02:00:05,450
Yeah, yeah.

1931
02:00:05,790 --> 02:00:06,010
Last game.

Last game.

1933
02:00:07,970 --> 02:00:09,490
Look, it wasn't our fault, guys.

1934
02:00:09,630 --> 02:00:11,770
There were three people trying to kill us.

1935
02:00:11,770 --> 02:00:13,890
Like what were we supposed to do?

1936
02:00:15,350 --> 02:00:15,870

I turned around and said, is that a scream important?

First day's easy.

02:01:24,220 --> 02:01:24,780
We'll be fine.

1954
02:01:24,900 --> 02:01:25,380

Coming in hot.

1972
02:01:54,980 --> 02:01:56,220
It's burning my fingers.

1973
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,320
Grabbing it with your fingers.

1974
02:01:59,740 --> 02:02:00,620
I put my face on.

1975
02:02:01,260 --> 02:02:02,060

02:02:24,200 --> 02:02:24,860
I'm so happy.

1986
02:02:25,860 --> 02:02:27,240
What if that's like a slur?

1987
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:29,580
It's an alien.

1988
02:02:31,980 --> 02:02:33,860
You don't know, do you speak their language?

1989
02:02:34,840 --> 02:02:35,800
Plop, plop, plop.

1990
02:02:35,940 --> 02:02:37,280
Plop, plop, plop.

1991
02:02:37,860 --> 02:02:39,000
Everybody, it's fries.

1993
02:02:41,680 --> 02:02:44,460
I'm getting your fries out for everybody.

1994

02:02:54,720 --> 02:02:56,700
I'll do order five.

2000

Ouch, ouch, ouch.

2003
02:03:02,760 --> 02:03:06,140
Oops, they won't know that it was on the ground.

2004
02:03:06,860 --> 02:03:08,480
Yeah, they can't see the kitchen.

2005
02:03:09,300 --> 02:03:10,280
We got more orders.

2006
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:12,160
Five is three.

2007
02:03:12,660 --> 02:03:12,660
Okay.

I think that's enough patties, right?

2013
02:03:23,980 --> 02:03:26,400
Do we need more patties or am I allowed to stop?

2014
02:03:26,760 --> 02:03:27,280
No, we're fine.

2015
02:03:27,380 --> 02:03:27,720
We're fine.

2016
02:03:27,820 --> 02:03:28,320
Don't waste more.

2017
02:03:28,540 --> 02:03:29,160
All right, all right.

2018
02:03:31,900 --> 02:03:33,980
I'm gonna wait for these three.

2019
02:03:34,220 --> 02:03:36,840
We're gonna need a restocking patty soon.

2020
02:03:38,500 --> 02:03:40,440
Maybe do some murder while we got a backlog?

2021
02:03:40,900 --> 02:03:44,240
No, I'm gonna... I'm gonna redesign my face.

2022
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:45,020

Oh, my God.

2034
02:04:31,100 --> 02:04:33,980
If you right-click, left-click, you can hold two patties.

2035
02:04:35,020 --> 02:04:38,300
If someone made me the drink for nine, oh, my God.

It's like I have two hands or some shit.

2038
02:04:41,900 --> 02:04:45,260
This changes everything in the patty-making business.

2039
02:04:49,240 --> 02:04:50,620
Big the Discovery.

2048
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:08,620
I'll order him, I'll cook more patties because we're running out again.

2049
02:05:10,520 --> 02:05:13,320
Oh my god, the dual wielding changes the fucking meta.

2050
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:16,500
Oh my god.

2051
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:19,400
I- I'm working on him.

2052
02:05:19,500 --> 02:05:19,820
I'm working on him.

2053
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:44,500
All right We need someone to kill some rats downstairs because we're like running out of patties Yeah, but I was Yeah, but we're saving it for day two Imagine how Imagine how efficient it'll be it'll just be one rat.

2054
02:05:44,660 --> 02:05:56,860
I can grab him I can grab the rat Blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip.

2055
02:05:56,860 --> 02:05:57,500
Did we do it?

2056
02:05:57,500 --> 02:05:59,760
It's worth slumping.

2057
02:06:00,540 --> 02:06:02,540
How did we get 100% last time?

2058
02:06:02,660 --> 02:06:04,080
Like, where the fuck are our customers?

2059
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:05,760
I'm like...

2060
02:06:05,760 --> 02:06:07,800
I picked somebody off, though.

2061
02:06:08,040 --> 02:06:09,420
Like, I actually made them mine.

2062
02:06:10,580 --> 02:06:12,080
Wait, well, how did you make him mad?

2063
02:06:12,420 --> 02:06:13,080
What did you do?

2064
02:06:13,420 --> 02:06:17,940
He said that's not what our...

2065
02:06:17,940 --> 02:06:19,860
Yeah, I mean...

2066
02:06:19,860 --> 02:06:21,420
They just aren't appreciative.

2067
02:06:26,590 --> 02:06:30,170
I guess we have time to redesign our faces while we wait for customers.

2068
02:06:30,830 --> 02:06:32,050
Oh yeah, we need a logo.

2069
02:06:32,250 --> 02:06:33,510
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2070
02:06:33,850 --> 02:06:34,590
Stephanie, make the logo.

2071
02:06:36,090 --> 02:06:38,570
There's so many patties.

2072
02:06:39,330 --> 02:06:40,050
It's fine.

2073
02:06:40,250 --> 02:06:42,870
They just ended the day and then did it again.

2074
02:06:42,910 --> 02:06:44,310
Oh, fresh for tomorrow?

2075
02:06:44,610 --> 02:06:45,750
Yeah, it'll be fresh for tomorrow.

2076
02:06:46,090 --> 02:06:48,070
It's made of outer rats, so like...

2077
02:06:48,910 --> 02:06:51,990
It's made out of rats, so it's fine.

2078
02:06:52,010 --> 02:06:53,050
So it's fine, yeah.

2079
02:06:53,490 --> 02:06:54,970
They have like...

2080
02:06:55,550 --> 02:06:57,730
42-hour expiry date.

2081
02:06:57,730 --> 02:06:59,270
Fucking first, Dookie.

2082
02:07:01,190 --> 02:07:03,590
He looked like the whole supply.

2083
02:07:04,910 --> 02:07:08,170
No, we still have seven patties left.

2084
02:07:08,510 --> 02:07:09,270
That's fine.

2085
02:07:09,410 --> 02:07:13,010
Dookie was yelling at everyone, being like, oh, shoot, more patties.

2086
02:07:17,300 --> 02:07:18,660
More patties.

2087
02:07:19,900 --> 02:07:21,380
Oh, it's our logo.

2088
02:07:23,060 --> 02:07:24,120
Can't be Burger Bunch.

2089
02:07:24,740 --> 02:07:25,480
We're franchising.

2090
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:28,460
I think it should be a little rat.

2091
02:07:28,740 --> 02:07:30,260
Oh, that's true.

2092
02:07:30,440 --> 02:07:36,040
Do you guys remember how long, like, food can be at, like, or meat can be at room temperature before it becomes a biohazard?

2093
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:37,020
We're in space.

2094
02:07:37,160 --> 02:07:39,420
It's always cold in space, so it should be fine.

2095
02:07:42,600 --> 02:07:45,160
It has rat preservatives on it.

2096
02:07:45,220 --> 02:07:45,940
We're fine.

2097
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:49,560
But it also attracts the actual rat.

2098
02:07:49,920 --> 02:07:52,300
That's why the rats want the patties back.

2099
02:07:52,640 --> 02:07:54,000
They're trying to bury the dead.

2100
02:07:55,460 --> 02:07:56,580
Oh, that's it.

2101
02:07:58,740 --> 02:08:08,200
You know how like, you know, they did those video science videos where like, um, they test out how fast fast food rots and the burger takes like, yeah, yeah.

2102
02:08:08,860 --> 02:08:10,460
In space, it never rots.

2103
02:08:10,820 --> 02:08:12,700
I'm ready for the next day if you guys are.

2104
02:08:12,700 --> 02:08:14,240
Because of our rat preservatives.

2105
02:08:15,080 --> 02:08:15,260
All right.

2106
02:08:15,480 --> 02:08:17,140
Wait, I need Sophie's designing our logo.

2107
02:08:17,260 --> 02:08:18,260
We should let her finish.

2108
02:08:18,480 --> 02:08:18,920
Okay.

2109
02:08:20,080 --> 02:08:20,680
Momu's done.

2110
02:08:20,740 --> 02:08:21,340
Don't worry, guys.

2111
02:08:21,420 --> 02:08:21,860
Don't worry.

2112
02:08:22,160 --> 02:08:26,900
Yeah, I want to see our, we're rebranding because we weren't doing so hot last time.

2113
02:08:27,180 --> 02:08:28,500
So we got rebranded.

2114
02:08:30,180 --> 02:08:33,460
We got to rebrand the restaurant so they don't know where the other one.

2115
02:08:37,740 --> 02:08:39,740
Oh, dance on that patty.

2116
02:08:41,440 --> 02:08:43,460
Wait, are you doing the Burger King foot lettuce?

2117
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:49,760
Number five, the Burger King foot lettuce.

2118
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:52,320
There are food inspectors in space, so it's fine.

2119
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:53,460
Oh, yeah.

2120
02:08:53,940 --> 02:08:55,180
Yeah, we're okay.

2121
02:08:55,340 --> 02:08:58,380
God, there's two whole vats of fries just fermenting as well.

2122
02:09:00,500 --> 02:09:02,440
I mean, we could just put it up here.

2123
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:09,240
Yeah, we just put it in a microwave and we'll be okay.

2124
02:09:09,960 --> 02:09:10,400
Yeah.

2125
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,600
That's what the microwave is for.

2126
02:09:13,860 --> 02:09:14,880
We got our logo.

2127
02:09:15,060 --> 02:09:15,540
Let's go.

2128
02:09:15,880 --> 02:09:16,560
What does it look like?

2129
02:09:16,600 --> 02:09:19,500
Oh, wait, that looks so good.

2130
02:09:20,460 --> 02:09:21,460
Wait, look at our logo.

2131
02:09:21,560 --> 02:09:22,720
Look at our logo, guys.

2132
02:09:23,240 --> 02:09:24,440
I think we can end the day.

2133
02:09:25,780 --> 02:09:27,140
Look at our logo.

2134
02:09:28,440 --> 02:09:29,800
Look at the logo.

2135
02:09:32,840 --> 02:09:34,400
It's a rat burger.

2136
02:09:34,420 --> 02:09:35,120
It's a sloppy burger.

2137
02:09:37,200 --> 02:09:38,300
Here they come.

2138
02:09:38,480 --> 02:09:39,560
Here they come.

2139
02:09:41,060 --> 02:09:42,920
I got order 11.

2140
02:09:43,460 --> 02:09:44,760
I got patties.

2141
02:09:46,300 --> 02:09:48,220
We don't need more patties.

2142
02:09:49,300 --> 02:09:51,860
What if they order five patties?

2143
02:09:52,520 --> 02:09:53,880
That's our entire stock.

2144
02:09:54,880 --> 02:10:00,280
Ever since I learned a dual wield, it changed the whole game.

2145
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:03,820
Change the whole system.

2146
02:10:09,700 --> 02:10:11,420
All right.

2147
02:10:11,940 --> 02:10:16,820
Wait, Fry's done.

2148
02:10:17,200 --> 02:10:17,500
Fry done.

2149
02:10:18,860 --> 02:10:20,380
We're showing 11.

2150
02:10:21,820 --> 02:10:22,980
Wait, I'll do the other soda.

2151
02:10:27,500 --> 02:10:29,460
I have the soda done.

2152
02:10:30,700 --> 02:10:31,680
Thank you.

2153
02:10:31,860 --> 02:10:32,880
Soda done.

2154
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:33,680
Two and two pick.

2155
02:10:33,740 --> 02:10:34,340
Top done.

2156
02:10:34,640 --> 02:10:35,320
Thank you.

2157
02:10:35,440 --> 02:10:36,800
Rise here too.

2158
02:10:37,320 --> 02:10:38,640
We're getting two orders.

2159
02:10:38,860 --> 02:10:39,520
Hello, hello.

2160
02:10:40,220 --> 02:10:40,940
Thank you.

2161
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:43,100
I got another cola.

2162
02:10:43,720 --> 02:10:45,200
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

2163
02:10:45,280 --> 02:10:45,680
There's a bag.

2164
02:10:45,860 --> 02:10:47,140
Oh, wait, wait.

2165
02:10:47,200 --> 02:10:48,640
Get the gun, get the gun, get the gun.

2166
02:10:49,020 --> 02:10:49,700
Mid, mid, careful.

2167
02:10:49,860 --> 02:10:50,420
He's looking at you.

2168
02:10:50,500 --> 02:10:51,760
Okay, no, he's, that's fine.

2169
02:10:52,700 --> 02:10:53,920
Um, I'll grab the soda.

2170
02:10:55,640 --> 02:10:55,800
Okay.

2171
02:10:56,020 --> 02:10:57,320
I'm getting ready.

2172
02:10:57,340 --> 02:10:58,740
Was he number one on the floor?

2173
02:10:59,680 --> 02:11:00,400
Oh, no.

2174
02:11:01,020 --> 02:11:01,380
No.

2175
02:11:01,860 --> 02:11:03,060
I got the soda, though.

2176
02:11:04,360 --> 02:11:05,660
Oh, oh, wait.

2177
02:11:05,920 --> 02:11:07,000
He's just dead.

2178
02:11:08,280 --> 02:11:08,480
All right.

2179
02:11:08,580 --> 02:11:09,980
I got the orange soda.

2180
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:12,260
Yeah, we got more customers.

2181
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:13,740
Yeah, we got more customers.

2182
02:11:14,440 --> 02:11:15,880
One patty, three lettuce.

2183
02:11:16,660 --> 02:11:17,560
I got number.

2184
02:11:17,780 --> 02:11:18,680
I got order for...

2185
02:11:18,680 --> 02:11:19,380
Oh, you got 14?

2186
02:11:20,140 --> 02:11:21,060
I got 15.

2187
02:11:22,060 --> 02:11:23,220
We're going to need...

2188
02:11:23,220 --> 02:11:24,680
We need more buns soon.

2189
02:11:29,570 --> 02:11:31,490
Someone doing 15, or should I do it?

2190
02:11:31,930 --> 02:11:32,930
Oh, I'm doing 15.

2191
02:11:33,050 --> 02:11:33,730
You can do 16.

2192
02:11:34,350 --> 02:11:35,490
I'll do 16.

2193
02:11:36,470 --> 02:11:37,030
Oh, you're doing 16?

2194
02:11:37,450 --> 02:11:37,630
Alright.

2195
02:11:38,490 --> 02:11:38,510
Alright.

2196
02:11:39,090 --> 02:11:39,610
Pickle.

2197
02:11:41,250 --> 02:11:41,770
Lettuce.

2198
02:11:41,910 --> 02:11:43,110
How many lettuce is that one?

2199
02:11:43,650 --> 02:11:43,910
Alright.

2200
02:11:44,490 --> 02:11:44,850
Alright.

2201
02:11:44,930 --> 02:11:47,590
And then make sure to draw a smiley face with ketchup.

2202
02:11:47,810 --> 02:11:48,270
Wait.

2203
02:11:48,570 --> 02:11:50,350
I messed with order 16 out.

2204
02:11:50,410 --> 02:11:53,730
I gave a pickle instead of lettuce.

2205
02:11:53,970 --> 02:11:54,890
This is mine then.

2206
02:11:54,990 --> 02:11:55,290
Yoink.

2207
02:11:56,450 --> 02:11:57,270
Wait, am I 15?

2208
02:11:57,470 --> 02:11:58,010
I'm 15.

2209
02:11:59,390 --> 02:12:01,170
Oh, where's the 15th guy?

2210
02:12:02,210 --> 02:12:03,110
Hello, sir.

2211
02:12:04,490 --> 02:12:05,850
I got your order.

2212
02:12:07,150 --> 02:12:07,670
Flip-flop.

2213
02:12:08,170 --> 02:12:08,610
Goodbye.

2214
02:12:13,660 --> 02:12:14,540
New order.

2215
02:12:14,780 --> 02:12:15,360
Order up.

2216
02:12:17,900 --> 02:12:18,600
17 going out.

2217
02:12:24,160 --> 02:12:25,600
Wait, do we need more patties?

2218
02:12:25,960 --> 02:12:27,800
Oh my god, wait, we need more patties, guys!

2219
02:12:27,940 --> 02:12:29,120
Why did you make me stop?

2220
02:12:30,640 --> 02:12:31,000
What?

2221
02:12:31,480 --> 02:12:32,060
Look at that!

2222
02:12:32,120 --> 02:12:33,400
We're running out of patties!

2223
02:12:34,580 --> 02:12:35,460
Is someone doing 18?

2224
02:12:36,200 --> 02:12:38,320
No, I meant like grilling.

2361
02:20:44,380 --> 02:20:46,660

2373
02:21:14,160 --> 02:21:17,440
Oh, 38, we developed a new meat.

2374
02:21:18,180 --> 02:21:20,420
Oh, we're not using rats anymore?

2375
02:21:20,660 --> 02:21:21,420
What happened?

2376
02:21:27,180 --> 02:21:28,560
I was gonna use one head.

2377
02:21:32,040 --> 02:21:33,000
Rat free!

2378
02:21:35,100 --> 02:21:37,920
But it gives the extra zest, though.

2379
02:21:38,900 --> 02:21:40,180
I'm doing 33.

2380
02:21:41,120 --> 02:21:45,160
If my burger doesn't have rat in it, I don't want it.

2381
02:21:47,800 --> 02:21:50,340
Wait, guys, we actually ran out of patties.

2382
02:21:53,520 --> 02:21:56,260
We haven't run out until the inside are used.

2383
02:21:57,100 --> 02:21:59,260
I used both fridges, guys.

2384
02:21:59,700 --> 02:22:01,080
I know when I'm out.

2385
02:22:01,800 --> 02:22:02,780
Doing 31.

2386
02:22:03,500 --> 02:22:04,300

2388
02:22:05,100 --> 02:22:06,340
Oh, okay.

2389
02:22:06,940 --> 02:22:09,220
Alright, I'm gonna go downstairs to see if there's more meat.

2390
02:22:11,960 --> 02:22:14,580
I'm going downstairs to check for supplies.

2391
02:22:18,460 --> 02:22:19,700
No rat, no burger.

2392
02:22:21,480 --> 02:22:22,860
Oh, we got buns, though.

2393
02:22:30,520 --> 02:22:32,880
Uh, so we ran out of patties, guys.

2394
02:22:33,020 --> 02:22:35,240

2395
02:22:35,480 --> 02:22:36,400

2437
02:24:21,980 --> 02:24:22,740
This isn't good.

2438
02:24:23,020 --> 02:24:24,420
I'm tripping on candy.

02:24:27,340 --> 02:24:29,120
What do you see?

2440
02:24:29,640 --> 02:24:32,020
What do you see when you're tripping on candy?

Oh, but she's dead too.

2448
02:24:47,740 --> 02:24:49,880
She took him down with her.

2449
02:24:50,560 --> 02:24:51,140
Wait, okay.

2450
02:24:51,500 --> 02:24:52,120

2452
02:24:56,900 --> 02:24:58,860
Oh, that's a good worker right there.

2453
02:24:59,680 --> 02:25:00,200
Don't worry.

2454
02:25:00,560 --> 02:25:02,480

2455
02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:05,360
Thank God.

2456
02:25:05,480 --> 02:25:06,480
We were running out of two.

2457
02:25:07,020 --> 02:25:08,460
We needed more supplies.

2458
02:25:10,460 --> 02:25:11,640

That's why I like the seed.

2462
02:25:23,620 --> 02:25:24,720
I wonder what she was seeing.

2463
02:25:24,980 --> 02:25:25,840
She was tripping on some.

2464
02:25:25,860 --> 02:25:27,820
I wonder what that was like.

2465
02:25:28,160 --> 02:25:28,160
They

2466
02:25:32,120 --> 02:25:34,500

2467
02:25:34,800 --> 02:25:35,440

2468
02:25:35,700 --> 02:25:36,640
They just shot Mint.

2469
02:25:37,300 --> 02:25:38,660
Wait, our customer shot her?

2470
02:25:38,760 --> 02:25:39,800
What did she do?

2471
02:25:40,420 --> 02:25:42,200
No, no, the TV keeps shooting people.

2472
02:25:42,300 --> 02:25:44,340
If you can make the orders, I'll keep an eye out for the TV.

2473
02:25:44,920 --> 02:25:45,380
Oh, okay.

2474
02:25:45,980 --> 02:25:48,820

Okay.

2478
02:25:55,080 --> 02:25:56,260
Wait, we have no buns left.

2479
02:25:56,300 --> 02:25:57,280

2480
02:25:58,240 --> 02:25:59,280

02:30:19,910 --> 02:30:21,910
Yeah, I can use it.

2575
02:30:25,510 --> 02:30:26,830
Uh-oh.

2576
02:30:30,070 --> 02:30:32,430
Another job badly done.

2577
02:30:34,630 --> 02:30:40,410
If you're expecting five star service at fucking sloppies, you're in the wrong neighborhood.

2578
02:30:41,050 --> 02:30:42,450
You're in space, ma'am.

2579
02:30:47,730 --> 02:30:47,790
Oh.

2580
02:30:48,810 --> 02:30:49,690
What?

2581
02:30:50,690 --> 02:30:52,010
What happened?

2582
02:30:53,870 --> 02:30:54,750
What happened?

2583
02:30:56,110 --> 02:30:56,490
What?

2584
02:30:57,450 --> 02:30:58,010
That's me.

2585
02:30:59,010 --> 02:30:59,790
Okay, okay, you're here.

2586
02:31:00,270 --> 02:31:00,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2587
02:31:00,990 --> 02:31:01,670
Where are you guys looking at?

2588
02:31:05,090 --> 02:31:05,970
Never rest.

2589
02:31:08,430 --> 02:31:09,170
Everything's fine, you guys.

2590
02:31:09,410 --> 02:31:09,770
Everything's fine.

2591
02:31:10,950 --> 02:31:12,250
Everything's fine as sloppy.

2592
02:31:14,710 --> 02:31:15,810
Are we good to go?

2593
02:31:16,090 --> 02:31:17,870
Do we have our lids yet?

2594
02:31:18,670 --> 02:31:19,230
Yeah, we do.

2595
02:31:19,410 --> 02:31:20,210
I've got cubs.

2596
02:31:23,870 --> 02:31:25,550
We got everything restocked.

2597
02:31:25,590 --> 02:31:26,750
I'm starting to work, Dave.

2598
02:31:27,210 --> 02:31:28,470
The day is over.

2599
02:31:29,650 --> 02:31:30,310
Wait, what?

2600
02:31:30,570 --> 02:31:32,350
I thought it was already over.

2601
02:31:32,630 --> 02:31:33,650
Yeah, I thought it was already over.

2602
02:31:34,850 --> 02:31:36,910
Alright, a day...

2603
02:31:37,550 --> 02:31:39,870
Wait, we didn't get lids.

2604
02:31:40,010 --> 02:31:40,730
We didn't get lids.

2605
02:31:40,910 --> 02:31:41,990
Oh, we didn't get lids?

2606
02:31:42,410 --> 02:31:43,150
Oh, shit.

2607
02:31:43,330 --> 02:31:45,230
Okay, well, maybe they won't order a drink.

2608
02:31:49,230 --> 02:31:50,690
Um, where's your order?

2609
02:31:51,890 --> 02:31:52,410
Um...

2610
02:31:54,750 --> 02:31:55,100
Uh...

2611
02:31:55,450 --> 02:31:56,910
Oh, you're doing so...

2612
02:31:58,390 --> 02:31:59,090
That's...

2613
02:31:59,090 --> 02:32:00,270
Not good?

2614
02:32:02,890 --> 02:32:03,240
That's...

2615
02:32:04,070 --> 02:32:06,390
Guys, what did they order?

2616
02:32:07,130 --> 02:32:09,190
This is a bad dokey!

2617
02:32:09,550 --> 02:32:10,990
This is a bad dokey!

2618
02:32:11,330 --> 02:32:11,690
What?

2619
02:32:13,570 --> 02:32:15,210
No, I'm here!

2620
02:32:15,610 --> 02:32:16,930
Okay, I need...

2621
02:32:16,930 --> 02:32:18,170
Oh, that's so dumb.

2622
02:32:18,990 --> 02:32:20,870
Wait, which one's the bad dokey?

2623
02:32:21,570 --> 02:32:22,890
Oh my god, thank god.

2624
02:32:22,910 --> 02:32:24,070
God, you made the right choice.

2625
02:32:24,310 --> 02:32:30,250
I was wondering who she was going to shoot.

2626
02:32:32,950 --> 02:32:34,850
Yeah, we're going to make food.

2627
02:32:36,650 --> 02:32:39,150
That's such an important question.

2628
02:32:40,770 --> 02:32:41,910
Guys, I think we've...

2629
02:32:43,710 --> 02:32:44,730
Wait, you can read it?

2630
02:32:44,850 --> 02:32:46,310
The first order is two burgers.

2631
02:32:46,650 --> 02:32:47,930
Wait, you can read it?

2632
02:32:48,150 --> 02:32:50,630
All right, well, I guess only Live will can make the orders.

2633
02:32:50,790 --> 02:32:52,190
None of us can read it.

2634
02:32:52,910 --> 02:32:54,310
They're completely invisible.

2635
02:32:54,550 --> 02:32:55,150
Me too.

2636
02:32:55,750 --> 02:32:56,950
I'm gonna put more pat.

2637
02:32:57,110 --> 02:32:59,350
I'm gonna fucking make more meat

2638
02:33:07,490 --> 02:33:09,530
Bye, we have bun box.

02:33:10,390 --> 02:33:11,950

I still can't see the monitor, so I don't know who's making our burgers for us.

But where did Limeo go?

Why did you shoot that guy?

2694
02:37:15,480 --> 02:37:17,800
We ran out of patties.

2695
02:37:18,560 --> 02:37:19,880
I just saw somebody get shot.

2696
02:37:20,860 --> 02:37:22,580
No, no one got shot.

A full customer is a happy customer.

Gotta make the customers happy, guys.

2703
02:38:02,720 --> 02:38:06,580

The gun's outside, though.

2716
02:39:24,360 --> 02:39:24,800

2717
02:39:24,820 --> 02:39:26,220
the customer dining hall.

2718
02:39:27,460 --> 02:39:27,700

2719
02:39:28,480 --> 02:39:30,240
There was a rat outside.

2720
02:39:30,380 --> 02:39:31,200
I had to shoot it.

2721
02:39:34,040 --> 02:39:36,200
This is so doomed, you guys.

2722
02:39:36,440 --> 02:39:37,080
This is so doomed.

2723
02:39:37,660 --> 02:39:39,600

2724
02:39:39,960 --> 02:39:40,360

2735
02:39:54,080 --> 02:39:54,800

02:41:00,710 --> 02:41:01,130
They're 35 seconds!

2751
02:41:01,450 --> 02:41:02,350
The times are gone.

2752
02:41:02,650 --> 02:41:03,090
They're still here!

2753
02:41:03,250 --> 02:41:06,530
I see them!

2754
02:41:08,190 --> 02:41:08,630
73?

2755
02:41:09,070 --> 02:41:09,710

2756
02:41:10,390 --> 02:41:15,010
Oh, I would take his...

2757
02:41:15,010 --> 02:41:15,250

78 is right here!

2759
02:41:16,590 --> 02:41:17,590
70 is right here!

2760
02:41:17,710 --> 02:41:20,490
You just keep getting quieter and quieter.

2761
02:41:23,800 --> 02:41:25,660
I see a 78 right here.

2762
02:41:25,740 --> 02:41:26,440
Oh, there's your name!

2763
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:29,440

2764
02:41:30,740 --> 02:41:34,540
Oh, goodbye everybody.

2765
02:41:34,760 --> 02:41:36,560
I hope you guys enjoyed your day at Sloppy's.

2766
02:41:37,100 --> 02:41:38,380
Please come back.

2767
02:41:38,400 --> 02:41:40,900
I hope the TV works for you this time.

2768
02:41:42,600 --> 02:41:43,520
Me too.

2769
02:41:44,080 --> 02:41:45,700
All right, we need more tomatoes.

2770
02:41:46,680 --> 02:41:48,360
Yeah, we just need more tomatoes.

2771
02:41:49,120 --> 02:41:49,980
Pickles and cheese.

2772
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:51,880
Where's the gun?

2773
02:41:52,860 --> 02:41:54,320
Tomatoes, pickles, and cheese.

2774
02:41:55,380 --> 02:41:57,640
I really need candy to take the edge off.

2775
02:41:57,820 --> 02:41:58,320
Me too.

2776
02:42:04,590 --> 02:42:05,310
My turn.

2777
02:42:07,490 --> 02:42:08,370
Was it a good candy?

2778
02:42:09,510 --> 02:42:10,230
Heck yeah.

2779
02:42:10,590 --> 02:42:13,130
How good was it, bro?

2780
02:42:14,270 --> 02:42:15,410
It was good.

2781
02:42:16,250 --> 02:42:17,050
That was pretty good.

2782
02:42:17,270 --> 02:42:19,250
Oh yeah, I had a good ass candy too.

2783
02:42:20,650 --> 02:42:21,150
I don't know.

2784
02:42:21,830 --> 02:42:23,430
How the fuck are we supposed to do this?

2785
02:42:23,530 --> 02:42:25,970
If I'm getting quieter and quieter and I'm the only one that can read it.

2786
02:42:26,030 --> 02:42:26,910
No, I can hear you.

2787
02:42:27,130 --> 02:42:28,830
She just didn't take a funny little candy.

2788
02:42:29,050 --> 02:42:30,090
Maybe you guys should take it.

2789
02:42:30,090 --> 02:42:31,910
Yeah, maybe you just gotta take your edge off that.

2790
02:42:33,210 --> 02:42:35,830
Oh, he got chill.

2791
02:42:36,890 --> 02:42:37,790
Whoa, bro.

2792
02:42:41,150 --> 02:42:44,710
Bro, get that edge off.

2793
02:42:47,590 --> 02:42:48,450
Ah, chill.

2794
02:42:50,350 --> 02:42:50,930
Was it good?

2795
02:42:51,090 --> 02:42:51,590
Hey, Kyle.

2796
02:42:52,110 --> 02:42:52,890
It was good, Kenny.

2797
02:42:53,930 --> 02:42:54,730
I might explode.

2798
02:42:55,310 --> 02:42:56,090
No, no, no.

2799
02:42:56,510 --> 02:42:57,630
Everything's very dark.

2800
02:42:57,990 --> 02:42:58,410
Oh.

2801
02:42:59,010 --> 02:43:00,590
Oh, you're tripping hard, bro.

2802
02:43:01,010 --> 02:43:03,190

2803
02:43:03,210 --> 02:43:05,070
Oh, you're tripping hard, hard.

2804
02:43:06,030 --> 02:43:07,630
She had a bad candy.

2805
02:43:08,110 --> 02:43:08,830
Oh, look, dude.

2807
02:43:10,010 --> 02:43:11,790
You had a tourist boat break in the kitchen.

2808
02:43:12,030 --> 02:43:12,590
Let's go, guys.

2809

I need my candy fix.

What'd you get?

2813
02:43:22,470 --> 02:43:23,990
It was just a normal candy.

2814
02:43:24,110 --> 02:43:24,470
That's that.

2815
02:43:24,570 --> 02:43:25,490
That's the good shit.

2816
02:43:26,230 --> 02:43:28,510
Oh, no, you're too immune to it now.

2817
02:43:28,810 --> 02:43:30,150
I took too many.

2818
02:43:31,030 --> 02:43:33,190

Because you were fine for me.

That's good.

2831
02:44:52,330 --> 02:44:54,050
Okay, let's see if you guys can see the monitor.

2832
02:44:54,210 --> 02:44:57,050
And if not, we just die because I'm not doing that shit again.

2833
02:44:57,530 --> 02:44:59,230
I can see the monitor.

2834
02:44:59,350 --> 02:44:59,770
I can see the monitor.

2835
02:45:00,870 --> 02:45:01,870
They're not even blank.

2836
02:45:01,890 --> 02:45:03,110
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2837
02:45:03,150 --> 02:45:03,650

2846
02:45:21,950 --> 02:45:24,830
Oh, okay, that's good, because then I don't want to kill the customers anymore.

2847

02:45:34,490 --> 02:45:35,390
It was crazy.

2852
02:45:37,110 --> 02:45:39,290

02:47:38,180 --> 02:47:39,520
This is burnt.

2872
02:47:39,700 --> 02:47:41,100
This will be bait for the rats.

2873
02:47:44,930 --> 02:47:46,270
Wait, I hear something.

2874
02:47:47,010 --> 02:47:48,630

Why is he mad?

2876
02:47:58,240 --> 02:48:01,160
Oh, there was an argument at the Sloppies.

2877
02:48:02,040 --> 02:48:03,340
Did you call the cops?

2878

Oh, was that the angry customer?

2882

Watch where you're leaving your stuff, bro.

2890

I think we got all of them.

2921
02:50:53,900 --> 02:50:55,540
I think we destroyed the rat economy.

2922
02:50:56,020 --> 02:50:57,200
Oh, no, there's a lot of rat.

2923
02:50:57,280 --> 02:50:57,980
Oh, there's a lot.

2924
02:50:58,200 --> 02:50:58,660
There you go.

2925
02:50:58,700 --> 02:50:59,140
That's good.

2926
02:51:01,300 --> 02:51:33,170

02:51:37,980 --> 02:51:42,400
So, um, I left the gun downstairs and it's- there's no bullets.

2928
02:51:42,860 --> 02:51:44,260
Oh, wait, why am I- oops?

2929
02:51:45,900 --> 02:51:47,640
I forgot- I'm sorry.

2930
02:51:48,080 --> 02:51:49,600
I brought an extra raw.

2931
02:51:49,980 --> 02:51:52,200
I forgot to cook the meat a little bit.

2932
02:51:55,380 --> 02:51:59,920
I forgot about the- the- the second step.

2933
02:52:00,200 --> 02:52:01,960
I skipped step two and five.

2934
02:52:03,880 --> 02:52:05,100
It's in the tunnels.

2935
02:52:07,860 --> 02:52:10,320
Wait, we had a patty box since when?

2936
02:52:15,280 --> 02:52:16,660
I got a heal later.

2937
02:52:18,860 --> 02:52:21,020
Do we have enough patty's?

2938
02:52:21,040 --> 02:52:22,480
Because I'm making more soon.

2939
02:52:29,940 --> 02:52:30,880
It's in the...

2940
02:52:32,860 --> 02:52:34,060
It's in the tunnels.

2941
02:52:34,320 --> 02:52:36,800
I just threw it downstairs and called it a day.

2942
02:52:41,130 --> 02:52:41,810
I got a heal.

2943
02:52:42,070 --> 02:52:42,310
I got a heal.

2944
02:52:42,330 --> 02:52:49,740

02:53:23,590 --> 02:53:26,550
We work until we die because we love sloppies.

2948
02:53:30,980 --> 02:53:32,340
I got more patties.

2949
02:53:34,140 --> 02:53:35,500
Oh, it came back?

2950
02:53:38,080 --> 02:53:38,500
No.

2951
02:53:44,120 --> 02:53:45,580
You mean this is wrong?

2952
02:53:45,700 --> 02:53:46,360
That's not fucking wrong.

2953
02:53:46,520 --> 02:53:46,800
I'm like.

2954
02:53:47,360 --> 02:53:49,700
Yeah, no, it bugs out like that sometimes.

2955
02:53:50,120 --> 02:53:51,140
It's a little freaky.

2956
02:53:51,660 --> 02:53:54,300
Okay, who's doing order two?

2957
02:53:54,480 --> 02:53:55,100
Is it gonna do two?

2958
02:53:56,760 --> 02:53:57,880
I'll do two.

2959
02:53:58,220 --> 02:53:59,720
I'm grilling patties.

2960
02:54:00,680 --> 02:54:03,000
Why don't we serve so many people we look at that?

2961
02:54:03,020 --> 02:54:05,340
I know, our Yelp review is so...

2962
02:54:05,340 --> 02:54:06,880
We have, like, five stars.

2963
02:54:07,260 --> 02:54:09,840
We're the best-selling fast food restaurant here.

2964
02:54:10,080 --> 02:54:10,880
We're at a lettuce!

2965
02:54:11,540 --> 02:54:12,200

Do it again, Mr. Strong.

2982
02:56:02,660 --> 02:56:04,900
Did someone just pay the rent or did we just lose $400?

2983
02:56:05,100 --> 02:56:06,140
No, I pay the rent.

2984
02:56:07,040 --> 02:56:07,220
Okay.

02:56:07,380 --> 02:56:08,400
Dude, we paid the rent.

02:56:15,420 --> 02:56:15,960
La-di-da.

2992
02:56:17,020 --> 02:56:18,840
I wish we could do amongst them.

2993
02:56:19,040 --> 02:56:21,620
I would say that the Sloppy sisters have moved on up.

2994
02:56:22,140 --> 02:56:22,540
Yay.

2995
02:56:24,740 --> 02:56:56,820

2996
02:56:58,340 --> 02:57:01,660
I would love the work in service industry again.

2997
02:57:01,680 --> 02:57:03,460
Smooth out the order screens.

2998
02:57:03,640 --> 02:57:04,800
I think it would be really good.

2999
02:57:05,380 --> 02:57:05,460
Yeah.

3000
02:57:05,980 --> 02:57:07,340
I mean, the fact...

3001
02:57:07,340 --> 02:57:07,480
Oh.

3002
02:57:07,900 --> 02:57:08,140
Oh.

3003
02:57:08,960 --> 02:57:09,440
Okay.

3004
02:57:18,140 --> 02:57:20,380
It's crazy that it's just early access, though.

3005
02:57:20,960 --> 02:57:23,540
I wonder what else they're going to do with it after.

3006
02:57:25,980 --> 02:57:27,780
I think I'll need my burger after us.

3007
02:57:28,160 --> 02:57:28,940
Oh, true.

3008
02:57:29,920 --> 02:57:31,640
The sloppy burger!

3009
02:57:34,290 --> 02:57:35,290
I wonder if...

3010
02:57:35,290 --> 02:57:37,210
Oh my god, they're hitting us with everything.

3011
02:57:37,910 --> 02:57:39,290
They're like, you ain't leaving.

3012
02:57:40,910 --> 02:57:42,630
Oh, I heard you wanted to leave.

3013
02:57:43,270 --> 02:57:45,130
No, we're gonna turn the power off.

3014
02:57:45,570 --> 02:57:47,230
I'll turn it back on.

3015
02:57:48,910 --> 02:57:49,250
Hey.

3016
02:57:49,710 --> 02:57:49,970

That's my job.

3019
02:57:54,810 --> 02:57:56,230
I'm getting that promotion.

3020
02:57:58,890 --> 02:57:59,750
Guys, I did it!

3021
02:57:59,790 --> 02:58:00,750
I turned on the power!

3022
02:58:01,470 --> 02:58:02,370
My kids fall.

3023
02:58:02,550 --> 02:58:05,630
I don't know my brain is like, I gotta keep, guys, there's so much to do.

3024
02:58:05,850 --> 02:58:06,630
I mean, you can't stop.

3025
02:58:07,070 --> 02:58:07,550
You can stop.

3026
02:58:08,590 --> 02:58:09,190
We're done.

3027
02:58:09,350 --> 02:58:09,930
Oh my god.

3028
02:58:10,270 --> 02:58:11,590
These cavities wasted.

3029
02:58:12,410 --> 02:58:13,790
They are wasted, but that's okay.

3030
02:58:13,810 --> 02:58:14,290
That's okay.

3031
02:58:14,390 --> 02:58:15,210
It's for the rats.

3032
02:58:15,370 --> 02:58:16,630
It's not a waste if we- Here, here.

3033
02:58:16,850 --> 02:58:17,070
Here, here.

3034

You have to come out.

Wait, what can't shoot you while you're in there?

3055

You're gonna cheat me!

3061
02:59:54,980 --> 02:59:55,880
You're gonna beat me!

3062
02:59:57,440 --> 02:59:58,560
Oh shit!

3063
03:00:00,680 --> 03:00:01,960
Wait, I'm alive!

3064
03:00:02,400 --> 03:00:02,680
Wait.

3065
03:00:04,260 --> 03:00:07,140
You shot my leg, you didn't shoot my head.

3066
03:00:07,300 --> 03:00:07,720
Stupid.

3067
03:00:08,200 --> 03:00:08,740
Oh dang.

3068
03:00:10,480 --> 03:00:11,020
Wait.

3069
03:00:13,300 --> 03:00:13,820
Movement.

3070
03:00:15,400 --> 03:00:15,580
Oh.

3071
03:00:15,800 --> 03:00:16,060
Wait, where are you?

3072
03:00:16,540 --> 03:00:21,140
Yeah, you can't shoot me when I'm getting mopped up.

3073
03:00:27,370 --> 03:00:28,710
That's a key, right?

3074
03:00:28,810 --> 03:00:29,750
That's two shots.

3075
03:00:34,380 --> 03:00:37,120
I just wanted to end it.

3076
03:00:37,240 --> 03:00:39,880
We couldn't leave the purgatory.

3077
03:00:41,880 --> 03:00:42,440
Why me?

3078
03:00:44,560 --> 03:00:46,940
I was trying to free us!

3079
03:00:47,520 --> 03:00:49,620
I wanted to free us!

3080
03:00:50,740 --> 03:00:51,480
Oh, okay.

3081
03:00:53,290 --> 03:00:53,790
Violet, man.

3082
03:00:55,070 --> 03:00:59,440
Where she started so...

3083
03:00:59,440 --> 03:01:01,120
You guys are here.

3084
03:01:01,260 --> 03:01:02,080
Straight up, don't kill me.

3085
03:01:02,140 --> 03:01:02,580
What do you mean?

3086
03:01:03,100 --> 03:01:05,380
She's straight up killed me.

3087
03:01:07,140 --> 03:01:08,240
Oh my gosh.

3088
03:01:08,340 --> 03:01:09,520
Oh, I'm about to die.

3089
03:01:09,660 --> 03:01:10,760
I'm about to die.

3090
03:01:11,440 --> 03:01:14,060
And then there was one.

3091
03:01:14,760 --> 03:01:16,740
The manager lives.

3092
03:01:20,630 --> 03:01:22,730
I need to get back.

3093
03:01:25,850 --> 03:01:27,030
I know you're going to unmute everybody.

3094
03:01:27,310 --> 03:01:29,090
Yeah, I'm unmuting everyone.

3095
03:01:30,590 --> 03:01:31,010
Hello?

3096
03:01:31,390 --> 03:01:33,110
Hello, yeah, I hear you.

3097
03:01:33,310 --> 03:01:34,790
I'm slowly unmuting people.

3098
03:01:35,150 --> 03:01:35,310
I'm unmuting.

3099
03:01:36,050 --> 03:01:37,070
Yeah, yeah, I'm unmuting.

3100
03:01:38,210 --> 03:01:41,130
I can't believe the manager lived in the end.

3101
03:01:41,810 --> 03:01:42,490
I can.

3102
03:01:43,030 --> 03:01:45,270
Why did you guys resist?

3103
03:01:45,390 --> 03:01:47,830
I was trying to free us from purgatory.

3104
03:01:49,630 --> 03:01:52,670
I wanted to die by a different hand, you know?

3105
03:01:53,450 --> 03:01:54,650
By whose hand?

3106
03:01:55,250 --> 03:01:55,830
Who was you?

3107
03:01:56,010 --> 03:01:58,630
Who are you to decide how I passed?

3108
03:01:58,890 --> 03:01:59,910
You still died!

3109
03:02:00,190 --> 03:02:01,150
You still...

3110
03:02:01,150 --> 03:02:03,330
I killed you, though.

3111
03:02:03,650 --> 03:02:04,570
I killed you.

3112
03:02:05,650 --> 03:02:07,250
You still left.

3113
03:02:09,390 --> 03:02:10,450
I lived.

3114
03:02:11,770 --> 03:02:12,590
GG's ever...

3115
03:02:12,590 --> 03:02:15,990
It was an honor and pleasure to watch.

3116
03:02:17,330 --> 03:02:22,030
It was a pleasure and honor to to work at Sloppy's again in space.

3117
03:02:22,810 --> 03:02:24,610
Yes, yeah, I had a wonderful time.

3118
03:02:24,710 --> 03:02:27,710
It was wonderful getting to hang with you as well for the first time, Nimmy.

3119
03:02:27,950 --> 03:02:28,690
It was awesome.

3120
03:02:28,690 --> 03:02:28,910
Yeah, thank you guys.

3121
03:02:29,330 --> 03:02:30,410
Thanks for having me.

3122
03:02:30,430 --> 03:02:31,190
Thanks for joining us.

3123
03:02:31,810 --> 03:02:31,870
Yeah.

3124
03:02:32,070 --> 03:02:33,170
Thank you for coming.

3125
03:02:34,150 --> 03:02:37,050
Maybe next time Severance will come out and then we can.

3126
03:02:39,550 --> 03:02:40,810
We'll play it.

3127
03:02:41,110 --> 03:02:41,270
Yeah.

3128
03:02:41,490 --> 03:02:45,470
Hopefully, and Minkin finally haunts us after Halloween.

3129
03:02:45,930 --> 03:02:46,670
For real.

3130
03:02:49,570 --> 03:02:50,010
Cool.

3131
03:02:50,490 --> 03:02:51,210
Thanks, guys.

3132
03:02:51,370 --> 03:02:52,730
TGs, everyone.

3133
03:02:53,030 --> 03:02:53,950
Have a great night.

3134
03:02:54,190 --> 03:02:54,630
TGs.

3135
03:02:55,050 --> 03:02:55,470
TGs.

3136
03:02:55,610 --> 03:02:55,910
TGs.

3137
03:02:56,010 --> 03:02:57,370
I take my hat to eat.

3138
03:02:57,790 --> 03:02:58,230
Go for it.

3139
03:02:58,570 --> 03:02:59,090
Sorry, Lyme.

3140
03:02:59,110 --> 03:02:59,770
Go for it.

3141
03:03:00,330 --> 03:03:00,890
What the fuck, Max?

3142
03:03:01,290 --> 03:03:02,690
You microaggressions.

3143
03:03:02,970 --> 03:03:03,450
God damn.

3144
03:03:06,470 --> 03:03:08,490
You were the manager, Lyme.

3145
03:03:08,870 --> 03:03:10,390
You deserved it.

3146
03:03:10,810 --> 03:03:11,970
Wait, you killed us all.

3147
03:03:12,190 --> 03:03:14,930
We all say, we all talk smack when you turn corn.

3148
03:03:15,150 --> 03:03:18,550
We're like, God, that Lyme, she smells so good, like a nice citrus.

3149
03:03:18,630 --> 03:03:19,030
What?

3150
03:03:21,750 --> 03:03:42,970
even her face looks like a lime move yeah yeah she's kind of she's kind of she smells kind of like a ferret i don't know oh they smell pretty bad don't they smell i think it's a good spell yeah they have aura go sleep go sleep oh yeah it's so late for you jesus everyone good night everyone

3151
03:03:49,530 --> 03:03:53,070
That was really, oh my gosh, my floating, my fucking ghost hats.

3152
03:03:56,010 --> 03:03:56,970
But that was fun.

3153
03:03:57,150 --> 03:04:01,450
I had a great time with the sloppy sisters and the side of Mimi fries.

3154
03:04:01,850 --> 03:04:03,830
That was a fun, fun time.

3155
03:04:06,690 --> 03:04:08,690
I'm glad I was able to find this.

3156
03:04:08,750 --> 03:04:16,810
We had like, by the way, like we were like throwing out games because like obviously like the original game we wanted to play did not work out for us.

3157
03:04:20,070 --> 03:05:11,190
the game did not come up because it was like they're like oh shit yeah steam like rejected the game because it has a little error so like yeah you're not getting the game today and so we like spitball a ton of games and then like i think like uh i think like we were like brainstorming games last night and like this morning and like none of the games were really vibing with us because like i said um i said this in the memory stream but the hardest part is that when it is fighting games that are more for more than four people that's like the hardest part just because like a lot of games are just four players max you know so we were just spitballing ideas i was like i have like a whole wish list of like um i have a wish list that um that i look at for uh multiplayer games And I was just,

3158
03:05:11,190 --> 03:05:20,650
like, browsing through, like, me, Mint, Snuffy, and Limeo were just looking through all the games that we have, like, saved up and bookmarked.

3159
03:05:20,910 --> 03:05:35,810
So I was like, oh, what about Keep Digging, Guilty as Sock, Bunker Invaders, and then we're like, oh, maybe we should get something spooky that's, like, the same themed as Severance, the spooky game that Mint wanted to play.

3160
03:05:35,810 --> 03:06:10,690
um and then so then like snuffy suggested yep yeah pizza delivery jackbox and then i was like oh why do there's predator hunting grounds that's sort of like the spooky ghost but instead of a ghost you can play the predator but and i was like oh wait that might not work because it's very aim reliant though if you're if you want to play the predator you gotta be able to shoot your gun I didn't say I was gonna mention on I was mentioned as planet mentioned on stream because I was like Oh,

3161
03:06:10,710 --> 03:07:19,430
I just know how I found and then and then later on I was like wait guys I found the perfect game and it was burger bots um and like it has like at that time when I found it we we found it well I found it at like 8 in the morning so that's why I need a nap time because like um you know my sleep schedule but I'm fixing it today because I said um I said I would fix and the end of the week is not yet is not yet there yet so don't worry i'm fixing um i'm getting my life i'm getting my shit together by the end of this day but anyway um i stayed up the whole night because i woke up i took a nap last yesterday and i've been taking a lot of naps and that's not good um it's um it's not been very healthy um but yeah i woke up at like two in the morning and i i stayed up all the way to like 10 a.m um because obviously like my my schedule is just nap time when i'm tired uh and then like i was like oh my god i need to take another i don't think i'll be okay if i just power through till three so um

3162
03:07:19,430 --> 03:07:28,050
so then i like went back to i took another nap time um don't worry at the end of the day i'll get my shit together um but yeah like i found the game

3163
03:07:31,450 --> 03:07:35,030
Like, how am I going to find more multiplayer games?

3164
03:07:35,190 --> 03:07:44,610
And the thing is, Zentrea, all she does, like, not all she does, but she loves playing, like, friend slop and multiplayer games.

3165
03:07:44,710 --> 03:07:50,950
Not just friend slop, but, you know, for some, I don't know how she does it, but I feel like every time I pop, I see her stream.

3166
03:07:51,310 --> 03:07:53,490
She's playing, like, the newest multiplayer game.

3167
03:07:53,770 --> 03:07:56,510
So I was just like, all right, I have Zentrea on my friend's list.

3168
03:07:56,630 --> 03:07:58,410
I'm just, I was looking at all the games she's playing.

3169
03:08:02,070 --> 03:08:08,270
Alright, somehow, I don't know how she does it, but every day she finds a new multiplayer game to play on stream.

3170
03:08:09,150 --> 03:08:18,710
And, uh, so I was just, I literally, like, went to your profile, clicked on all games, and I was like, yoink.

3171
03:08:19,490 --> 03:08:21,950
I was like, oh, Burger Vox, I've never seen this game before.

3172
03:08:22,090 --> 03:08:23,450
And I was like, oh, wait, this is perfect.

3173
03:08:23,650 --> 03:08:27,390
It's a fast food simulator in space with, like, horror themes.

3174
03:08:27,530 --> 03:08:31,370
I was like, wait, that's, that's perfect.

3175
03:08:31,590 --> 03:09:05,930
need to do any research i'll just i was like oh my god i don't have to do any research i could just mooch off of zen and enjoying the friend stuff yeah so so i was like guys i found i found the game perfect game for all of us and i was like guys hey look at that let's play this one all of this game and we're like all right let's go and then that's how that's how i discovered burger bots

3176
03:09:09,370 --> 03:09:59,850
i didn't yeah i don't do any work perfect just like a manager at a fast food restaurant um yeah i had a great time playing with everyone i hope this audio was okay um our audio team wasn't available um so uh my manager had to do the audio balancing and um he was like well the well the proximate chat's pretty shit but like i think it's okay and i was like oh i hope it's okay yeah he's like he's like proximate chat's shit but like i think it's okay and i'm like oh okay i hope it's okay then it was as good as proximate chat can get yeah yeah So,

3178
03:10:09,010 --> 03:10:10,290
That's all that matters.

3179
03:10:10,570 --> 03:10:13,750
Anyway, guys, I hope you guys had a fun time watching.

3180
03:10:14,030 --> 03:10:18,870
It's always fun playing with the sloppy sisters and also the sad and Mimi Fry's.

3181
03:10:19,290 --> 03:10:23,770
Um, I love working in the service industry.

3187
03:10:46,570 --> 03:10:49,490
Okay, I shouldn't take my nap, but God, I really wanted to...

3188
03:10:49,490 --> 03:10:53,210
Guys, I told myself, I get my shit together today.

3189
03:10:53,290 --> 03:10:56,950
Today's the last day where I get my shit together.

3190
03:10:59,470 --> 03:11:02,310

All right, guys.

As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

3201
03:11:11,810 --> 03:11:12,430
Posture check.

3202
03:11:12,710 --> 03:11:14,490
Get them around to get that blood flowing.

3203
03:11:14,650 --> 03:11:16,550
And if you step for me, head to bed, guys.

3204
03:11:16,710 --> 03:11:17,570
You deserve it.

3205
03:11:17,850 --> 03:11:21,490
I actually, I don't know what I plan next week.

3206
03:11:21,590 --> 03:11:29,450
Other than, other than, um, I think I'm going to put two Batman, like, two Batman playthroughs for next.

3207
03:11:29,470 --> 03:11:29,970
next week.

3208
03:11:30,510 --> 03:11:32,850
But other than that, I don't really have any plans.

3209
03:11:33,030 --> 03:11:35,250
I don't think I have any collabs arranged for next week.

3210
03:11:35,490 --> 03:11:35,930
We'll see.

3211
03:11:36,850 --> 03:11:42,290
Um, maybe like, I'll ask Cheeby if she wants to do Little Nightmares, like, uh, three next week if she has time.

3212
03:11:42,810 --> 03:11:47,830
Um, but other than that, there's nothing, like, planned yet, uh, for next week.

3213
03:11:48,330 --> 03:11:56,270
Um, but definitely two Batman playthroughs, because, like, um, you know, one of, there's so many controls in Batman that I think I'll need it.

3214
03:11:59,750 --> 03:12:10,550
I think I definitely think I'll need me to play throughs because I'm gonna forget the controls if I don't Um, but anyway guys, uh, I'm gonna head off now.
