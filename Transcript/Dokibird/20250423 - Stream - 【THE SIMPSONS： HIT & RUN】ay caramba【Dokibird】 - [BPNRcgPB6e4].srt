1
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,320
Hello, hello, everybody.

2
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,320
Hello.

3
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,040
Alright, guys.

4
00:01:52,260 --> 00:02:06,020
Okay, so I may sound very low energy today because if you guys don't follow me on Twitter, I had to take Dad, Doki Amber Doge, to the vet today at 9 in the morning.

5
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,140
So I'm very tired.

6
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,480
I have... don't worry, I have day-old coffee.

7
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,540
This is my life right now.

8
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,600
I have day-old coffee.

9
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,440
to get me by because I couldn't finish my coffee yesterday while I was working.

10
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,860
So here's a little... for those who don't follow me on Twitter, sorry, I'm going to start the stream a little bit down, a little bit low energy.

11
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:35,540
But I know some people would like to have an update on what's going on with Doki Amber Doge, with Dad.

12
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,480
He's not here right now.

13
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,040
He's actually at the dog sitter.

14
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:46,700
So basically what happened is that a couple of days ago, I noticed that he hasn't...

15
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,420
He hasn't been using my bed to sleep on.

16
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,780
And I got, you know, and you know, it's almost close to summer.

17
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,740
And it is getting hot right now.

18
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,220
So I thought that maybe it's because it was a little too hot.

19
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,400
And he didn't want to be under the covers or anything.

20
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,280
He didn't want to use the bed.

21
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,300
So that's why he's using his own dog bed.

22
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,720
So I didn't think much too much about it.

23
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,060
So just because like, oh, it might be summer.

24
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,560
And he's just feeling a little too hot.

25
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,520
And the thing is, so this is basically like, every wiener dog's owner.

26
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,000
But Dad hurt his back.

27
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,880
So he's feeling pain in his back right now.

28
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,320
And I didn't initially thought that was a problem.

29
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,200
Because he was walking.

30
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:41,740
And like, he... The way he was moving seemed like he didn't care what's going on.

31
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:49,160
Like, so I didn't notice that he had back issues.

32
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,380
Because he was like, you know, he was peeing.

33
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:51,980
He was pooping.

34
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,520
He was moving.

35
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,240
He was walking.

36
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,860
He was doing little, like, scurries and stuff during walks and everything.

37
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,660
So I didn't realize, um, something was wrong.

38
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:07,740
And then I think like, a day or two later, um, I was like, you know, I was eating food at my desk because I was working.

39
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,540
And then, you know, he would usually come along because he's like, super food hungry.

40
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:26,360
And, uh, and so, but then he didn't like... So for those who own wiener dogs, uh, they, they would like, uh, like to like, uh, you know, get up on their hind legs and then put their, put their front paws on your legs.

41
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,240
And be like, get closer to you.

42
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,080
And so with that... So he didn't do that.

43
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,160
So I, that's when I knew that something might be wrong.

44
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,880
Um, because I was like, oh, why isn't he doing that?

45
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,600
Like, like he tried to, but then he like stopped himself.

46
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,840
So I, like, I was like, oh, that's weird.

47
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,720
That's very, that's very weird.

48
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,360
So, um, um, but then I was just like, oh, maybe he's just tired, you know?

49
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,840
Cause he was still acting normally.

50
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,920
Um, he was still acting normally in terms of like walking wise.

51
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,580
So I didn't think it was back issues just cause like he was walking normally.

52
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,940
He was eating.

53
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,500
He was, he was eating.

54
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,720
He was like, you know, demanding food and everything.

55
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:12,240
Um, I did notice that he wouldn't walk up to my room to demand stuff anymore.

56
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,660
He would bark from his bed.

57
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,540
So like, I should have seen that as like, oh, some, he doesn't want to get up.

58
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:31,380
So he, you know, like, you know, when like people are bedridden, they would just like stay in their bed and be like, get, but be like, I demand, I demand food or like nurse, help me.

59
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,480
Like stuff like that.

60
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:40,720
But he was just in his bed, just barking and whining at me and was just like, get over here and feed me like on his bed.

61
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,480
And then I would, you know, get up from my bed and then I like feed him and stuff like that.

62
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,680
And then he would get out of his bed and then start eating that.

63
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,340
He was like, you know, like, like Squidward.

64
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:56,760
He was like using the call buttons, like Spongebob, I require, I require you to change clothes for me and stuff like that.

65
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,480
Like, like he would do that.

66
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,680
Um, and, and then like after I do the things he wanted me to do, then he'll get out of the bed.

67
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:13,500
Um, but then so like, um, so I noticed he didn't like want to like, you know, lean on my leg for like, you know, if I'm eating something and he's like, I want human food.

68
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,300
He wouldn't do that.

69
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,800
But I still at that point, I still have yet to like piece together that it was back issues.

70
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,120
I just thought he was really tired.

71
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,280
Um, and he was just like feeling tired or something.

72
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:38,880
So, um, two days ago on Sunday was when I finally figured out it was back issues because when I was doing his walks, um, we encountered another dog and then it was a big dog.

73
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,680
So I like tried to pick him up.

74
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,760
I was like, okay, I would bend down and then he would like just go into my arms and then I pick him up.

75
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,500
But then when I did that, he tried to go to my arms.

76
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,220
Um, he would like, he would usually automatically go to my arms.

77
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,560
The moment I bent, like bend down and like, like give him like, you know, the pose being like, okay.

78
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,500
Like, you know, the carry pose, like get in my arms, like get my arms out.

79
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,300
And then he tried to get my arms and he started yelping.

80
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,600
I was like, oh, okay.

81
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,840
Okay, something is wrong.

82
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,500
Like, that's what I instantly knew.

83
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,860
Like, oh my gosh.

84
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,400
Okay, something is definitely wrong.

85
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:15,820
Um, and so I was like, okay, like he couldn't get on my arms because he yelped.

86
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,880
And I was just like, oh, he doesn't like being carried.

87
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,460
But then I already picked him up.

88
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:24,660
Now I like picked him up anyway, because I was like, okay, I don't want you near this dog, this giant ass dog.

89
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,060
Anyway, and then I touched his back and then he yelped again.

90
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,160
And I was like, oh, oh, no.

91
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:32,780
Okay.

92
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,420
Okay.

93
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:33,520
Yeah.

94
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,020
Okay.

95
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,640
Now I know what's going on.

96
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,660
And so, so, um, so, uh, I, you know, I called my vet and I go to vet.

97
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,040
And obviously, like Monday was Easter Monday.

98
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,240
It was Easter.

99
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,120
Okay, it was like long.

100
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,180
Sorry, it's not Easter Monday.

101
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,440
So Sunday was Easter.

102
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,120
And then they had long weekend.

103
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,280
So Monday was like they were busy on Monday.

104
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,920
So I was like, so but they could get me in on Tuesday could get me in today.

105
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,400
So I had debated for the longest time.

106
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,040
I was just like, all right.

107
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:09,580
So I either, I either like go to an emergency or wait for the good event.

108
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,060
So if there was like anything wrong with dad, I would take him to the emergency event.

109
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:20,280
But luckily they could put me in, like if I had to wait more than like one day, I'll take him to the emergency event.

110
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,760
So I took him, but then they were like, we can fit you in for tomorrow at 9am.

111
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,760
And I was like, okay, that's great.

112
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:32,480
Um, and so, uh, so I went to the vet and you know, she was very, too.

113
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,020
When I was in the Uber ride to the vet, he was like shaking a lot.

114
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:43,860
And then if you guys didn't know if a dog like licks his lips a lot, then he's like in pain or like he's like really stressed out or like anxious.

115
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,900
So I noticed when he's like, you know, in my arms while I was in the Uber, he was like licking his lips a lot.

116
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,420
And then he was like shaking a lot and everything.

117
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,320
And I was like, okay, this is like not good because, um, you know, he usually isn't like that.

118
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,020
When he's like to the vet, he would be like really happy, excited.

119
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,640
And, but like, if he's like anything, I saw notice he was like licking his lips, licking his like mouth a lot.

120
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,640
And that's when, you know, like he's like stressed and like in pain and everything.

121
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,720
So he can't like sit... I noticed like the way he was sitting, like he couldn't sit his normally way of sitting.

122
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,580
So, and even then it was like putting pressure on his back, I believe.

123
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,060
So, but like, yeah, when he was in his own bed, he was not reacting like that.

124
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:29,520
He was like, you know, obviously he knows like what position to sleep on and like how to lie down comfortably and stuff like that.

125
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,800
So like back before I like actually took him to the vet and realized it was a back issue.

126
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,080
He acted normally, except for the fact that he didn't want to be in my bed.

127
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,040
And, um, he, he was like, he just didn't want to be picked.

128
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,500
Like the moment I realized he didn't want to be picked up was when I realized something was wrong.

129
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,700
Because normally he's like really like pay attention to me.

130
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,940
I want attention and everything.

131
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,940
So, um, I was at the vet for like three and a half hours.

132
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,120
Uh, because like, you know, there was the examination.

133
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:07,780
Um, and they gave me a choice of either going to like neurologists to like, you know, if he had to get surgery or something or anything.

134
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,220
Because if you guys didn't know, like, it's a very common problem with wiener dogs.

135
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,660
And that's why I was like, no, like that's like, no, it's like something to do.

136
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,660
It could be like something related to like his disc for his spine.

137
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,640
Because, um, but he can still walk.

138
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,300
He still feels feeling in his back legs, which is great.

139
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,460
I'm really happy about that.

140
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:33,120
Um, and, and like, it's really common amongst like smaller dogs.

141
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,060
And especially wiener dogs.

142
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:41,100
So I think what happened was that he, I do have doggy stairs for the bed.

143
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:47,600
But sometimes when he hears, like, when he hears like food, he would jump off his bed.

144
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,560
And I think like, he might have like, um, hurt his back doing one of the jumps.

145
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,100
And I, I did buy an extra pair of stairs now.

146
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,700
Um, just in case like, you know, when he does come home.

147
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,320
Um, um, I'm going to try and make sure he used, I'm going to have two stairs.

148
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,900
One at the front of the bed.

149
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,140
And one, because my other stairs was at the back of the bed.

150
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:16,660
Um, and he does, he likes to, you know, get there as fast as possible with, for the food, like human food.

151
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:25,140
Um, so I did get like, like I did, uh, uh, get like another, I bought another stair, staircase for him.

152
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,080
For the front of the bed.

153
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,840
And I'm going to make sure like, you know, he's going to learn how to, you know, not jump off the bed anymore.

154
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,360
Um, for the front bed, um, for the front side.

155
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,280
Um, but he is getting older.

156
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,200
I do agree.

157
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,640
But like, he's still young enough for... I hope that recovery will be okay.

158
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,220
So the vet says it's still early stages.

159
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,640
So, um, it's still like early stages.

160
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,940
So, well, it's not like staircase.

161
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,240
It's like those like slanted stairs, you know?

162
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,300
It's sort of like low-key, um...

163
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,280
He's like middle-aged.

164
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,460
I'll say he's like middle-aged.

165
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,540
But yeah, it's not like those, like, you know, like those actual staircases.

166
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:11,380
It's like those like slanted stairs where it's like half stairs, half ramp type deal for like smaller dogs.

167
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:17,640
And basically the vet says that it could still be early stages because I didn't take him to a neurologist.

168
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:26,640
Because they were like, well, like obviously he was like, he still walk and he still has feelings in the back of his leg and everything.

169
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:34,060
And they were saying like, if I take him to a neurologist, like at best they're just gonna tell you to do the same thing which is like pain medication.

170
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:41,420
Um, and just like rest and like no movement until, uh, until like, uh, until he's better.

171
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:51,060
So, uh, I'm just hoping that that's basically the case where it will be like, he just said like rest up for two weeks.

172
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,400
And then after two weeks, we're gonna go back to the vet and like do a checkup and stuff.

173
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,640
And, uh, and that's what like, I just hope that that's basically it.

174
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,260
Um, and that he'll recover and then at best, I'll just have to make sure he doesn't jump as much anymore.

175
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,740
Um, but it was very scary.

176
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:16,660
I, I, there was like a, he had to get blood tests taken to like make sure the medication doesn't like conflict with like whatever he has.

177
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:22,620
So like, um, so like when he was getting his blood tests done, you know, I had to wait for like 40 minutes for that.

178
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,920
And like, I, I left, like, I left dad.

179
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,760
I like Doki Amber Doge at the vet.

180
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:31,080
And then like, I went to the coffee shop nearby and I was like crying in the coffee shop.

181
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,360
I was like, oh my God.

182
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,720
Oh, I hope he'll be okay.

183
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,100
Cause like, also like, I've been having a really rough month.

184
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,880
Not gonna lie.

185
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,200
I've been like super fucking stressed out in general.

186
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,220
I've been like really stressed out.

187
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,260
And like, you know, it's been a very unlucky month so far.

188
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,260
So I was like, oh my God, I hope he's okay.

189
00:13:51,780 --> 00:14:03,540
So I was like drinking my London fog, like crying in the coffee shop while like some fucking university students were doing like practicing for a fucking, uh, uh, presentation or some shit.

190
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,740
While I was just like in the corner being like, oh my God.

191
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:15,380
I just hear this fucking group of university students is practicing for the goddamn stupid fucking presentation.

192
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:28,740
I, uh, uh, uh, um, um, um, anyway, um, but, oh my gosh.

193
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:35,800
So I also like when I, you know, I actually had to call my dog sitter to pick, um, him up with me.

194
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,540
So he's at the dog sitter right now because I didn't want to stress him out too much with the, with two back to back car rides.

195
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:46,400
Uh, um, and, uh, yeah, I know it's finals week too.

196
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,920
So she must've been like, oh man, she must be freaking out about finals week.

197
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,740
Like, um,

198
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:05,480
anyway, um, so because like during the car ride to the vet, um, to the vet, uh, he was like obviously incredibly stressed out.

199
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,600
And, um, um, I was really worried.

200
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:17,180
I didn't want to like stress him out even more, um, with like two back to back car rides and the decision to, the decision to like put him in dog sitter.

201
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:25,140
So he's going to be a dog sitter for two weeks until I take him back to the vet is because, um, just this oncoming week, I am incredibly busy.

202
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:30,260
Like the timing was just incredibly terrible for me because I have like tech rehearsals.

203
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,200
I have a convention later this week.

204
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:40,140
I have several sponsors I have to do, which means I won't be like able to monitor him 24 seven to make sure he doesn't move and everything.

205
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:50,440
And so I have a lot of things I have to do and be like, um, I have to do and like make sure I'm actually like on my PC.

206
00:15:51,080 --> 00:16:01,920
And so like, there was no way I could commit to like taking care of dad, uh, like, and making sure he doesn't like move around too much when I have like a lot of stuff I have to do on the PC itself.

207
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:11,120
And like, obviously, I don't want that worry to be there for me as well while I'm like doing like a sponsor and like, you know, performing at a convention and everything.

208
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:16,180
So like, you know, I have to check up on him and I can't really do that when I'm in the middle of a sponsor.

209
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,080
And, uh, so it's a lot of money.

210
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,920
I was also low-key freaking out about the amount of money I have to pay.

211
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:30,520
Um, because if anyone is ever a vet, a dog owner or pet owner, vet bills are incredibly expensive.

212
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:37,360
And, um, um, and also like the dog sitter is not like some random dog sitter.

213
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,480
I like fucking Craigslist.

214
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,420
Um, it's actually a really, really good dog sitter.

215
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:47,960
Like, they give me like treats and gifts and stuff during like the holidays and stuff like that.

216
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:59,680
If I have the dog sitter like look after dad, um, like during the holidays or like his birth, like during like any special time or whatever, they actually give me like a little like doggy care package.

217
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:06,880
Like, they're like, oh, here's a little doggy care package with some new toys and some treats and stuff like that.

218
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,840
Um, um, and everything.

219
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:22,460
And they have, like, every time, uh, Doki Amber Doge dad would, like, um, be there, like, visit the dog sitter, they have, like, they would buy, like, they would give him, like, a box of, like, new toys and everything.

220
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,100
And then he, like, picks out a toy during the visits and stuff.

221
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,680
And they also give him, like, you know, grooming, like, they also, like, give him baths and ear cleaning and stuff like that.

222
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,580
So, you know, I do spoil him a lot by giving him a, like, hiring a really good dog sitter.

223
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,060
For him.

224
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,120
Because I do want him to have, like, a really good time.

225
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,680
And have, like... And it's also, like, a family, too.

226
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,960
So, like, it's, like, you know... Like, a middle-aged couple.

227
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,060
With, like, you know, a kid.

228
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:58,180
And, like... And, uh... So, they are... You know, he gets, like, a more family experience living with them.

229
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:05,060
And, um... They also send me, like, updates and stuff whenever... Like, you know, they send me updates and stuff every day.

230
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:09,580
And, you know, I also trust the dad to take care of dad.

231
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,220
In terms of, like, medication-wise.

232
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:19,980
Apparently, he told, like, the dad... The husband was the one that helped pick up me... Like, not me, though.

233
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:24,500
But, like... Because I went and, um... Grief ate their, like... What was it called?

234
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,260
Stress ate at a Korean restaurant right after.

235
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,000
Uh... They picked my dog up at the vet.

236
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,020
Uh... I was just, like... In a Korean restaurant.

237
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,180
Just, like... Stress eating.

238
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,680
Uh... As they play it.

239
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,640
When I... When... When, um...

240
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,440
When, uh... The husband picked up my dog at the vet.

241
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,440
I was just, like... Just sitting by myself at the Korean restaurant.

242
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,720
I'd be, like... Oh, my God.

243
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,600
At least he'll be happy.

244
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,340
Uh...

245
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,260
Anyway.

246
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,080
Yeah.

247
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:57,920
So...

248
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:06,260
So, uh... So, basically, like, the husband... I also, like... I'm worried myself about, like...

249
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,780
Doing medication and stuff for my dog.

250
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,820
Because he also needs, like... Uh... Like, there's, like, a shot he has to do.

251
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,920
Basically, he's on three types of medication.

252
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,300
And they're all sort of, like, to mitigate... Like, help heal his back.

253
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,860
And to mitigate the pain and everything.

254
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,580
And one of them is, like, a shot.

255
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,060
And I was, like... I don't trust myself with needles or anything.

256
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,640
So, like... I'm glad that, like...

257
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,240
You know... You know, I was... You know, like, when your pet is, like...

258
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,380
Has to be medicated.

259
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,040
And then it's your dad.

260
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:36,940
Or, like...

261
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,640
Like, it's the dad who usually does the medication.

262
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,100
And stuff like that.

263
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,400
So, I live alone.

264
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,040
I don't have, like...

265
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,860
I don't have, like...

266
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,440
You know, I get scared doing all of that by myself.

267
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,940
So, that's why I also asked the dog sitter to help me take care of dad for me.

268
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,320
For the next two weeks.

269
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,700
Because I was, like...

270
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,260
Oh, my gosh.

271
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:58,740
This...

272
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,500
I'm so scared doing all of this.

273
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,860
And I don't trust myself to be able to, like, provide the best care possible for him.

274
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,960
So, that's why I...

275
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,260
You know, I was willing to pay.

276
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,060
It's gonna...

277
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:10,980
I know it's a lot.

278
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,780
Because when I was in Japan...

279
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,880
And he was...

280
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,840
He was there.

281
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,300
He was...

282
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,140
You know, when I was in Japan.

283
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:19,940
And, like...

284
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,860
He was at the dog sitter while I was in Japan.

285
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:22,960
It was a lot.

286
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:23,800
So, like...

287
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,660
I know, like...

288
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,500
The two-week visit is gonna...

289
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,180
Oh, my God.

290
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,880
I'm not thinking too much about it.

291
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:29,740
But, like...

292
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,040
I'm gonna try and work...

293
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,780
More...

294
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,180
Like...

295
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,680
Harder the next two weeks.

296
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,760
To, like...

297
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,200
You know...

298
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:35,940
Be able to...

299
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,140
Like...

300
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,320
Well, I can't afford his care.

301
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:37,760
You know...

302
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,240
But to, like...

303
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,160
Make back...

304
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,580
The amount that we...

305
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,780
Obviously spending.

306
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,340
And I really appreciate...

307
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,480
Thank you so much for the super chats, everybody.

308
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,660
I really, really appreciate it, guys.

309
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,180
Without your support.

310
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,600
And, like...

311
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,060
You know, guys being here and everything.

312
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,100
I'm able to provide, like...

313
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,860
Really good care for...

314
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,100
Doki Amber Doge.

315
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,760
And I really, really appreciate it, guys.

316
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,700
Because, like...

317
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,160
You know, I don't have to worry too much.

318
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,180
I don't have to worry about, like...

319
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:05,800
Money-wise.

320
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,120
Regarding, like...

321
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,140
The care for him.

322
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,520
And it really means a lot.

323
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:17,140
And everybody knows how expensive like taking care of pets are when like, you know, there's like a medical emergency.

324
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:27,120
And I'm hoping that we don't have to go through the surgery route because that's like something I'm like most worried about.

325
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:33,360
So I'm hoping that... They said it's early stages regarding like his back problem.

326
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:38,300
So usually if it's early stages, it's just like... And he can walk.

327
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,360
He like moves fine.

328
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,100
He was like shaking.

329
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,320
Like he's... Oh my gosh.

330
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:41,540
Okay.

331
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,440
So you know how when dogs are anxious, they like do like a little shake and stuff.

332
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,820
So he did that a lot.

333
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,380
But then I didn't realize he was like shaking because he was anxious and stuff.

334
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,780
So I didn't think it was anything wrong.

335
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,680
So he's been like moving around a lot and stuff like that.

336
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,220
So he still has movement and everything.

337
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,740
So that's great to know.

338
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,480
And I... Oh my gosh.

339
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,560
I just love wiener dogs so much.

340
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,500
But they come with so many problems.

341
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,320
But it's like... They're cute.

342
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,980
They're so cute.

343
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,420
And it's like... But they do come with a lot of problems.

344
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,100
If you are ever a dog owner.

345
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:21,180
And you are you know financially not as secure as you would like to be.

346
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,740
I highly recommend never getting a wiener dog.

347
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,900
Because they are the most expensive little fuckers.

348
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,940
I have to take care of.

349
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,220
Because they have so many issues.

350
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,740
They have... They... I was with the vet.

351
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,520
And then um... You know...

352
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,740
Um... The vet was like... Is...

353
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,760
The vet was like... Um... Is he allowed to have treats?

354
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,500
I was like... Oh yeah.

355
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,640
He's just allergic to chicken.

356
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,880
And then... The vet was like... Wow.

357
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,340
You're the perfect... You're the peak perfect wiener dog.

358
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,460
Allergies and back problems.

359
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,440
And I was just like...

360
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,780
And I was just like...

361
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,400
So... For those who don't know...

362
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:03,460
So...

363
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:03,460
For those who don't know...

364
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,100
Wiener dogs... Also have...

365
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,220
Allergy issues too.

366
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,180
So they're most...

367
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,540
Most... Likely...

368
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,580
Allergic to everything.

369
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,080
So...

370
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,740
So...

371
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,130
That's...

372
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:13,890
That's...

373
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,310
Winner... Winner...

374
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,150
Peak performance.

375
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:23,850
And...

376
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:24,750
Um... Yeah.

377
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:25,590
So...

378
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,310
So like wiener dogs...

379
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,450
When they get old...

380
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:28,970
Like...

381
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:29,650
They're not older.

382
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,010
But usually happens...

383
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,310
As like they turn one or two.

384
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:36,270
They also develop allergies and balding issues as well.

385
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:45,130
So he has like balding issues on his ears and stuff.

386
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,230
So he doesn't have like a lot of hair on his ears.

387
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:52,970
Because he is a winter dog and he hit the jackpot in terms of like, the genetic lottery.

388
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:14,050
And you'll notice in the photos where his ears are lighter than the rest of his body is because it is genetics where like winter dogs do go bald, but it only like, it only affects like the front part of his body, like the chest area and like his ears.

389
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,390
So like, it does happen.

390
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:24,350
Um, so, so I'm hoping that the two weeks will be okay for him.

391
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:28,150
And after that, like, I'm going to make sure he never fucking jumps again.

392
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:42,690
Uh, if I have to, if he does still jump when he's on my bed, I will revoke his bedtime, like his, like his bedtime on my bed.

393
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:46,510
So like, and then I'll just be like, you just stay in your fucking dog bed.

394
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,450
I don't care anymore.

395
00:24:48,990 --> 00:25:00,610
Like, like, if he still fucking, you know, hears food time and still jumps off my bed, I will be revoking his privileges on being on the human bed now.

396
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:08,970
Um, but right now he just has been like, I think he knows because he has back issues that he has refused to get on the bed, on the, on my beds.

397
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:10,870
And he's just been on his dog bed and everything.

398
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:17,970
So, yeah, so I'm just, I'm just hoping everything will be okay, um, in the next two weeks.

399
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:24,190
And I really appreciate, guys, all the super chats, all the akkas, all the, every super chat you guys are giving.

400

Thank you, thank you.

406
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,870

00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,050

408
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:36,790
Thank you so much.

409
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,930
Hongeorge, thank you for the magenta super for dad bills.

410
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:40,670

411
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:41,970
Thank you, thank you.

412
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,490
I really, really appreciate you guys.

413
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,190
I'll do the other Super Chats.

414
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:51,370
Thank you all the Super Chats for the others soon as well, but thank you guys.

415
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,790
I really, really do appreciate it.

416
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:59,230
I'm sorry I started off the stream like a little bit downer news, but also like a little optimistic.

417
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,930
Sorry, I can't English as well.

418
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:05,910
I have barely slept today.

419
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:11,610
Because like I said, I was awake since like 8am today.

420
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,970
I did take a little nap.

421
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:16,370
I did take a two-hour nap and I had to get up, obviously.

422
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:27,770
I had to like get up to like give like the dog sitter like his food and his favorite toy and stuff like that.

423
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:33,890
Because, you know, they picked him up at the vet and everything.

424
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:45,670
So he didn't get his food or he didn't get his like shampoo, his allergy shampoo, or like his favorite toy or like, you know, his like stuff to make sure he's comfortable and everything.

425
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,890
So I had to wake up.

426
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:53,910
I had to wake up like after my two-hour nap to just like give him everything, give the dog sitter everything.

427
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:56,170
Lord Kurosis, thank you for the Magenta Soup.

428
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:56,950
Thank you.

429
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:57,970
Thank you for that.

430
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:58,830
Thank you guys.

431
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,270
Miller, thank you for the Magenta Soup.

432
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:01,890
Thank you.

433
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,070
Thank you, Dad Dawgs.

434
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,050
I really appreciate you guys.

435
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:14,750
My manager was like, you should cancel stream and just like relax and like, you know, just like have time to remind yourself.

436
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:23,970
But I honestly, I really wanted to stream today because streaming and just getting my mind off things and just being with you guys helps a lot for me too.

437
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:34,130
Cause I was like, no, I told my manager that like, I rather just stream and just like, you know, be in the company of you guys, like with my dragoons and everything.

438
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:36,090
Because it always does make me feel a lot better.

439
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,630
And it does cheer me up a lot.

440
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,570
And I just want, I didn't really want to be alone.

441
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:42,230
You know, cause I'm alone now, right now.

442
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,030
Cause obviously dad's not here.

443
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:45,690
He's at the dog sitter.

444
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,830
So, um, he's not here.

445
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:51,030
And I was like, uh, it doesn't make me feel better streaming for you guys.

446
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:57,750
And like you guys being here with me and you know, let's just hope for, um, his speedy recovery.

447
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:04,790
Um, because you know, um, it's crazy when like, he got his medication shot.

448
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:12,410
Uh, uh, when he got his medication shot at the vet, um, he was like moving around.

449
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:15,530
He's like, I'm better now, but obviously it was like painkillers.

450
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:18,970
So, so he's like, yippee!

451
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,250
And he was like moving around.

452
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:26,370
And he was like trying to like, you know, like, he was like trying to, you know, like put his front paws.

453
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,910
And standing up on his hind legs, put his front paws on people.

454
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:29,950
He's like, yippee!

455
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:30,550
I'm okay!

456
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,940
I was like, no!

457
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:34,880
Get down!

458
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:41,700
Like, um, me, the dog sitter, and like the vet were like pushing him down.

459
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,780
And I was like, no!

460
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,960
You're not better!

461
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,120
It's just the painkillers talking!

462
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,880
And he was like, you just don't feel anything!

463
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,040
We were like, every time he was doing it, we were like, no!

464
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:55,620
Stop!

465
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,460
You're not, it's just the painkillers!

466
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,600
You're not better!

467
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,100
He was just like, yeah!

468
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,520
I'm good now!

469
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,480
And he's like moving around and everything.

470
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,000
And when we got like his shots.

471
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,000
And so...

472
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:28,400
But yeah, like I'm just, like I said, I'm hoping for the two weeks that he'll recover.

473
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,580
And thank you guys so much, Shallon, for the Akasupa.

474
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,200
I really appreciate it.

475
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:39,620
And guys, I know like some of you guys who can't, or like, like cold deaths, who are like, I can't spend more, sadly, due to bills.

476
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,480
But this is for Dad.

477
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,540
Thank you again for Super Chat.

478
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,540
I really appreciate it, guys.

479
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,240
You really don't have to, but I really appreciate it.

480
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,480
Please look after yourself first, though.

481
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,480
But thank you guys.

482
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:49,540
Bite Size!

483
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,460
Thank you for the Akasupa!

484
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,380
Thank you, thank you!

485
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,160
We're all praying for Dad.

486
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,220
Speedy and full recovery!

487
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,040
Thank you guys!

488
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:54,800
Thank you again!

489
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:08,040
But yes, thank you, everybody, for being, you know, like, feeling for Dad, for like, wanting to make sure he's okay.

490
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:19,880
Because, you know, he's been part of my life and being part of your life as well, because of all the stories I share of him and like all the, like, you know, him being like such a huge part of my stream and everything.

491
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,140
And like, you know, he's as much as part of my life as yours.

492
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,280
So I really appreciate you guys showing so much care for him.

493
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:33,420
And like, you know, for donating and, you know, wishing him well and everything.

494
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,420
And just to make sure he's like okay and stuff like that.

495
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:45,700
So, like, the dog sitter will tell me, like, if anything comes up, if there is anything that does come up, they will message me.

496
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,980
Or they will message me and we'll take him to the vet ASAP.

497
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,480
If anything happens.

498
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,040
But I hope that, you know, it's just...

499
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,660
Because like, you know, he's for like four days.

500
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,780
He wasn't at the vet for four days when it first started.

501
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:05,340
So I hope that like, you know, from there, it's just mostly him recovering.

502
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,820
He just needs to recover.

503
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,220
He just needs to rest and relax.

504
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:16,900
And then eventually, like, you know, his back would feel a lot better.

505
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:20,060
And it's mostly just, you know, he can't...

506
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,800
He just can't jump anymore afterwards.

507
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,300
I need to make sure he doesn't jump anymore.

508
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,500
Which is a bit of a problem because he does love jumping.

509
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,880
So, like, when we play fetch...

510
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:42,760
When, like, I play fetch and I like, you know, throw the ball, he would jump to grab to catch the ball and stuff.

511
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,560
So, like, I gotta make sure he doesn't do that anymore.

512
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:47,880
Like...

513
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,080
So...

514
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:56,200
That's like the one thing I have to make sure he doesn't do when we play fetch.

515
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,240
Uh...

516
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,680
No more...

517
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,760
No more parkour for that little guy.

518
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,620
Thank you for the magenta soup.

519
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,860
Thank you, thank you.

520
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,500
I really appreciate it, guys.

521
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,520
I really...

522
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,720
Jumping has...

523
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,420
Has been revoked now.

524
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,300
And...

525
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,540
So, yeah.

526
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,060
But yes, thank you guys.

527
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,240
I really appreciate it.

528
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,380
I really appreciate you all being there for him.

529
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:25,580
And...

530
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,040
Um...

531
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,260
Want to know what's going on and everything.

532
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:29,540
Um...

533
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,060
I just hope that...

534
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,840
Like, if I have to, I will, like, take him to surgery.

535
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:34,440
If...

536
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,620
But that's, like, basically, like, the last resort type deal.

537
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,320
Like, you know.

538
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,500
And they did say it was early stages.

539
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:41,620
So...

540
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,000
Um...

541
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,580
As long as it's, like, you know, still early stages and everything.

542
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,960
It's mostly just rest and recovery.

543
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,280
And...

544
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,520
And he's gonna be, like, stuck in his little...

545
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,020
Um...

546
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,380
Pen and everything.

547
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,720
So, he's not gonna...

548
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:56,460
Uh...

549
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,320
He's not gonna be, like, moving anywhere.

550
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,520
From what I'm told.

551
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,520
Uh...

552
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,820
So, he's just gonna be, like, you know, in his little...

553
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,700
Little, like...

554
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,960
Like, stuck in the little pens.

555
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,820
Like, no moving!

556
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:09,200
From what, like, the black doctor's gonna tell me on how they're gonna do it.

557
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:13,260
I'm just really appreciative that they are, you know, willing to...

558
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,340
Like, the fact that they were willing to take care of him.

559
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,320
Last minute.

560
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,920
Literally, I, like, messaged them.

561
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,620
And I was like, hey, this is, like, an emergency.

562
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:24,900
And, um, I know, like, usually I need to, like, give you a heads up and stuff.

563
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,520
And they're like, we'll be there.

564
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,260
Like, instantly, they're like, yeah, like, um...

565
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:29,660
The...

566
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,960
The main doc says, like, yeah, my husband will...

567
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,160
We'll drive over right now to the vet.

568
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,440
And, like, we can pick him up and, uh, look after him.

569
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,700
While, like, you know, I thought I was like, I'm really...

570
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,080
This week is really bad timing because I love work stuff.

571
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,940
Uh, and then they instantly was like, we'll be there.

572
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,120
Um, we can pick him up, like, right now.

573
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:47,620
Like, we...

574
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:50,240
My husband will drive over to pick him up and everything.

575
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,360
And I was, like, really appreciative of that.

576
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:55,060
Because, usually, I need to give, like, heads up and stuff.

577
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:55,840
But they...

578
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,500
They also really love him.

579
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:03,120
Um, like, it was really funny because I, like, I had a really...

580
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,800
Um, I was really stressed out at work for work-related stuff.

581
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,580
So, um, I wanted him to, like, be...

582
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,660
I couldn't take care of dad at one point.

583
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,860
Like, I think, like, this was, like, a month or two ago.

584
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,860
And then I messaged him.

585
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,120
I was like, hey, I know, like, um...

586
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,260
I remember, like, a month or two ago.

587
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:23,400
I was just like, hey, um, do you have any openings this week?

588
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,160
Uh, to look after him.

589
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,680
And then the dog stare was instantly, like...

590
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,560
We cancelled our arrangement with the other owner because...

591
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,880
They, like...

592
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,720
The dog sitter messaged me back and was like, we love him.

593
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,500
We cancelled our other appointment with the other...

594
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:43,080
With the other, like, dog that we were supposed to dog sit.

595
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,240
Uh, so yeah, we could go pick him up whenever.

596
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,260
And I was like, oh my god, yippee!

597
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:54,220
So, the family really loves him as well.

598
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,640
Like, they always tell me, like, oh yeah, he's part of our family.

599
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,040
Like, he feels like he's part of our family as well.

600
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:05,100
Um, and like, uh, and that, like, you know, that, uh...

601
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:09,460
That makes me feel really happy that they love him as much as, like, you know, I love him as well.

602
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,820
So, uh, yeah.

603
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,760
He is the number one priority.

604
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:13,820
That's...

605
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,500
So, it is sort of like a second home, uh, to him.

606
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:28,340
And, uh, and you know, the family, the dog sitter loves him as much as me as well.

607
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:34,260
And, uh, they're like, yeah, he's like, he really is, like, a part of, like, their family as well as my family.

608
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,400
And, um, and I really appreciate that.

609
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:41,980
They literally, like, took him in instantly during the vet visit.

610
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:48,160
Like, when the husband came over at the vet, we still had to wait an additional, like, 40 minutes.

611
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,740
Um, for the medication and everything.

612
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:57,200
And for, uh, like, we had to wait, like, 15 minutes for dad to come out of the vet office.

613
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,620
And then another, like, we had to wait another, like, uh, 30 minutes.

614
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,180
And, like, he was waiting for 30 minutes with me.

615
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,880
And he was, like, you know, um, helping me look after him and, like, petting him and everything.

616
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,660
Making sure he's comfortable and everything.

617
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,920
And while we were waiting.

618
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:16,440
So, um, so it was really appreciative.

619
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,000
And then, you know, um, he was like, oh, let me Google.

620
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,360
And then I told him what's going on.

621
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:25,640
And he's like, okay, let me Google, like, what I can do around the house to make him feel more comfortable.

622
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,680
And, uh, so I really, yeah, I really appreciate that.

623
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:34,360
The fact that they were willing to come over on, like, you know, instantly.

624
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:39,900
Because, like, you know, I was worried that they were also, like, had to dog sit somebody else.

625
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,400
Since they're not just, like, they're not just, like, my dog sitter.

626
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,220
They're, like, other people's dog sitters, too.

627
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,960
And there was, like, no hesitation or anything.

628
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,700
And, um, that's why I felt like they were, like, one of the best dog sitters I've ever had.

629
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,020
And that's why they're very expensive, too.

630
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,920
So, thank you guys... so much!

631
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:05,760
I'd do anything for in that video & like, I really appreciate it too.

632
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,100
Aka, thank you for the AkaSuppa!

633
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,460
Thank you!

634
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,060
Zechra, thank you for the AkaSuppa!

635
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:14,400
Thank you!

636
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,060
Praying for dad's recovery!

637
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:16,880
he's a good dog!

638
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,740
Will maybe continue to be spoiled by the dog sitter.

639
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,280
Thank you!

640
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:20,520
Thank you!

641
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,420
Thank you for the AkaSuppa!

642
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,200
Thank you thank you!

643
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,880
Anyway, sorry, I change the topic...

644
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,780
I hope you guys enjoyed Nimi's debut.

645
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:32,400
I was watching Nimi's debut while waiting for my stream to start.

646
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,580
Just to pass the time.

647
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:34,820
Really cute.

648
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,080
I love her new skin suit.

649
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,440
It's incredibly cute.

650
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,940
She grew 10 feet tall.

651
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:47,220
Because I pushed my stream for her debut.

652
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,240
And it also let me zone out and disassociate for a little bit.

653
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,840
You know.

654
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,440
It was... I think my favorite part was when the Nappling started clapping.

655
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,440
I was like, oh my god, please clap.

656
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:09,190
And it was like... I thought that was so fucking cute.

657
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:10,770
It just... I don't know.

658
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:14,290
I think that was my favorite part of the entire debut.

659
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:17,550
It was just the fact that the little Nappling was just like...

660
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:25,530
That's really... Yeah, clapping was incredibly fucking hilarious.

661
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:28,570
And that was my favorite part of the entire...

662
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,970
Just the little guy clapping.

663
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:36,590
I don't know.

664
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:37,750
There's just something about it.

665
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:39,610
It just makes me so happy.

666
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,670
I don't know.

667
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,010
I don't know.

668
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:55,210
I don't know.

669
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:55,210
I don't know.

670
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:55,210
I don't know.

671
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:56,810
I don't know if I'll be finishing this game today.

672
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:04,130
Because apparently what you guys told me, the last level is really, really, really, really hard.

673
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:13,330
So, I'm like, really, really scared about the last level.

674
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:16,050
So, I'm not gonna push myself to...

675
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:22,390
I'm not gonna push myself to stream... to finish the game and everything.

676
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:25,750
And, oh yeah, another, like... Okay, it's not funny.

677
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:27,450
But, like, um...

678
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:33,010
But, like, I found out that... You know how, like, the Pope died on Easter?

679
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:36,650
And then, like... You know how I found out about it?

680
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:40,770
I didn't realize the Pope had a fandom.

681
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:43,350
Like, an actual, like, Twitter fandom.

682
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,910
And what do you mean by that, Doki?

683
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,830
Well, I found out about it because, like...

684
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:54,190
One of, like, the main fan artists for the Pope was, like, freaking out about it.

685
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,670
And I was like, the Pope has fan artists?

686
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:58,510
Yeah!

687
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:03,290
There's, like, an active fandom for the Pope.

688
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:08,630
And, like, literally, this is, like, one of the most well-known fan artists of the Pope.

689
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:13,430
And, like, all she draws is, like, Pope art.

690
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:19,570
And I was...

691
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:21,650
I was... Or he... I don't know.

692
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:23,710
But, like, um...

693
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,110
That's, like, all they draw.

694
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:26,990
And I was, like, looking through it.

695
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:28,350
And I was, like, oh, my God.

696
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:30,590
Like...

697
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:30,930
No!

698
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:33,210
It's, like, you know, like...

699
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:36,690
You know how fandoms have, like, fan artists?

700
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,970
You know, like, also, like, how I have fan artists?

701
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:42,910
So, like, the Pope... Like, the Catholic...

702
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:45,770
There's, like, not just the Pope, but, like...

703
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:47,850
I guess, like, the Catholic...

704
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,850
The Vatican City fandom?

705
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:51,350
I... I don't know.

706
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,090
I don't know what to call it!

707
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:55,170
It's...

708
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:58,410
The Vatican City fandom?

709
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:04,450
So, I was very surprised.

710
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:05,570
Cause, like...

711
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:06,630
You know, obviously the...

712
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,690
The one of the most...

713
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:10,270
Well-known fan artists for it was, like, freaking out.

714
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:11,570
It was, like, oh, my God.

715
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:12,910
Like...

716
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:14,830
I can't believe...

717
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:16,030
He passed away.

718
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,130
And then...

719
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:17,530
No!

720
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:18,270
Okay!

721
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:19,610
No, you don't understand.

722
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,330
Okay, I'll show one of the fan art.

723
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:22,190
Like...

724
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,610
Cause I was, like...

725
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:24,070
What?

726
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,150
Like...

727
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:26,690
Um...

728
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:28,290
This is, like, how I...

729
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:29,330
Found out...

730
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:30,290
About...

731
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:32,170
Um...

732
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:34,230
How I found out about the fandom.

733
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:37,290
And how I found out that, like...

734
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:38,210
The Pope died.

735
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:39,970
Like...

736
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:40,410
I...

737
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,590
Oh, my God.

738
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:42,430
But...

739
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,250
Like...

740
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,090
This is what I...

741
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:44,590
This is...

742
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,570
This is what I mean.

743
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:45,970
Like...

744
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,650
You can get their art prints and everything.

745
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:48,770
So...

746
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:49,790
I love, like...

747
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:50,850
Beloved My John.

748
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:51,910
Like...

749
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:52,970
I was just like...

750
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:53,810
Oh, my God!

751
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:55,450
Um...

752
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:55,890
Yeah, that...

753
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,410
That's how I found out.

754
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:58,550
Uh...

755
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,530
I was like...

756
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:02,550
I was like...

757
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:02,790
Oh, my God!

758
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:04,250
I didn't realize they have...

759
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:05,470
They have...

760
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,570
Um...

761
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:07,530
Um...

762
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:10,410
I didn't realize they have a huge fandom fight.

763
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:14,090
Um...

764
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:16,330
Um...

765
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:17,150
And I was...

766
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,590
I thought that was really interesting.

767
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,050
I was, like...

768
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:21,870
Going into the glimpse of, like...

769
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:22,830
The other side.

770
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,030
Like...

771
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:25,510
Um...

772
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,190
Um...

773
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,170
And everything.

774
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:29,430
And...

775
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:30,310
Yeah, so...

776
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:31,350
That's how I found out.

777
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:32,250
Also, like...

778
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,270
The...

779
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:34,010
The...

780
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:34,770
The...

781
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:35,210
The...

782
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:36,070
The...

783
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,070
The fact that, like...

784
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:42,470
Twitter is, like, campaigning which Pope they want to be elected as if, like, their vote...

785
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:43,190
As if...

786
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:43,950
As if...

787
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:44,770
There's a campaign.

788
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:45,410
Or...

789
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:47,510
I...

790
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:49,410
I don't know if you also saw that.

791
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:50,330
But there's, like...

792
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:55,430
There's, like, Twitter campaigns for, like, whichever Pope they want to, like...

793
00:42:55,430 --> 00:43:05,550
to like, you know, succeed the the last pope and but then it's like, but I don't think they know that like, that's not how the next pope is elected.

794
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:17,050
I don't think they realize that's how, that's how the pope elections work.

795
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:21,150
Um, the Vatican's next top pope.

796
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:40,370
Like, so I was, I saw on Twitter, um, I saw on Twitter where like, someone was like, we gotta get this guy, and like, guys, we have to vote for this guy, and I was like, I don't think they realize how, how, how popes are selected.

797
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:48,550
Um, um, looking at the pope elections.

798
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,670
Uh, Parapol, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

799
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:55,870
I think when the pope came to Japan, he wore, oh yeah, no, he did, I saw it!

800
00:43:56,010 --> 00:44:09,990
It was like an anime drawing of the pope, and then like, um, he's gonna, he's like, literally the only pope that has listened to Megalovania, and like, been exposed to Sans Undertale.

801
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:13,410
Because of the game theory?

802
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:15,670
What was it?

803
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:27,110
Game theory gave, uh, the pope, uh, Megalov, like, uh, like, the, the soundtrack of, um, Undertale or something?

804
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:28,330
Yeah, MatPat did that.

805
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:33,210
MatPat gave him, like, the soundtrack for Undertale, and made him listen to Megalovania.

806
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:38,650
Like, like, that's when it all started.

807
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:40,690
Uh, but yes, thank you, guys, super chat, thank you, thank you.

808
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:42,950
Anyway, let's play Simpsons!

809
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:48,250
Sorry, this is a long ass, we, we, it's been an hour, I didn't realize.

810
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:50,290
Oh my gosh, sorry, guys.

811
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:51,990
Let's actually get to the real gameplay.

812
00:44:53,790 --> 00:45:01,410
But it, it was nice to just, you know, talk with you guys after the very stressful, stressful day.

813
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:04,750
Um, but you guys always make me feel a lot better and everything.

814
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:09,290
Alright, let me see, let me see what, I have to make sure, okay, the sound is okay.

815
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:15,750
Uh, but yeah, thank you guys for listening to me ramble on, um, today.

816
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:19,770
I really appreciate it, guys, it does help a lot, and gets my mind off things.

817
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:23,150
Anyway, let's go back to the Simpsons!

818
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:24,770
Resume game.

819
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:26,310
I think we're at March now?

820
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:28,270
I'm pretty sure.

821
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:30,190
Bum-ba-dum!

822
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:30,550
Wait.

823
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:33,670
Oh yeah, I was like, no, don't get, put me back.

824
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:38,010
I was gonna be like, no, you can't do this to me.

825
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:40,270
Don't put me back here.

826
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:42,410
But I forgot, I came back for Florida.

827
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:45,670
I, I was like, I can't do this, I'm not strong enough.

828
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:48,090
I literally got back from the vet, please.

829
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:49,710
I'm not strong enough for this.

830
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:53,530
I- All right.

831
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:55,470
Talk to me, son.

832
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:56,870
Hello?

833
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:00,450
Son, talk to... Oh my god, no.

834
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:02,550
Why is my son not talking to me?

835
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:03,370
Please.

836
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:04,030
Oh, eh.

837
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:11,910
Are you okay?

838
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:15,390
Oh, no!

839
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:16,510
Not Google!

840
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:20,610
Hands?

841
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:21,930
Crop circles?

842
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,510
There's got... Aliens!

843
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:27,470
It's always aliens.

844
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:29,070
All right.

845
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:30,890
Let's see.

846
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:33,830
Find Chief Wiggum and collect donuts for him before time runs out.

847
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:34,410
Wait, what?

848
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:35,790
Why?

849
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:37,750
Does he only accept payment in donuts?

850
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:38,690
All right.

851
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:42,770
Do you guys know they gave Chief Wiggum's wife, like, a personality now?

852
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:45,810
Which is crazy, because she was, like, literally just his plus one.

853
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:50,590
And then they, like, made him, like, made her, like, like, a spy.

854
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:52,050
Like, no, like, what was it?

855
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:55,030
They made her a scam artist or some fucking shit?

856
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:55,790
Oh, shit.

857
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:56,170
Goodbye.

858
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:00,650
No!

859
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:03,450
I didn't know it's times right now!

860
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:06,390
I'll do my best.

861
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:11,730
Yeah, she's, like, uh, she's, like, uh, spy slash heist person or whatever.

862
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:13,250
Oh, my God.

863
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:15,950
I'm trying to remember how... Guys, I don't remember the controls.

864
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:17,010
All right, here we go.

865
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:18,690
We're... Okay.

866
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:20,130
It's okay.

867
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:21,330
I'm... Easy cut.

868
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:21,770
No!

869
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:26,310
Why did it end so fast?

870
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:28,350
I just got in the car!

871
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:32,070
Like, excuse me, I'm... How fast?

872
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:33,210
How much faster do you want me to be?

873
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:36,370
Oh, just because I hit one car, I've lost a game.

874
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:37,370
I...

875
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:39,350
Please!

876
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:41,750
Wiggum, where are you going?

877
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:44,430
What is this difficulty?

878
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:45,370
Oh, no.

879
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:48,210
What is this difficulty, Spike?

880
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:50,250
Okay.

881
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:50,910
Okay.

882
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:51,130
Okay.

883
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:51,330
Okay.

884
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:51,490
Okay.

885
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:52,230
Guys, guys, guys.

886
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:53,030
I figured it out.

887
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:53,750
Okay.

888
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:54,870
I used a shortcut.

889
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:56,910
I forgot about the shortcut.

890
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:57,970
All right.

891
00:47:58,010 --> 00:47:58,430
Here we go.

892
00:47:59,070 --> 00:47:59,650
It's fine.

893
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:00,030
It's fine.

894
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:00,990
I used a shortcut.

895
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:02,390
Now I'm in front of him.

896
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:03,970
All right.

897
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:04,570
Here we go.

898
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:06,370
Oh, no.

899
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:06,690
No.

900
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:07,310
Not even.

901
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:08,410
Even with the shortcut.

902
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:09,150
No, please.

903
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:10,410
Slow down.

904
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:11,070
Wiggum!

905
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:14,190
Where are you... Where are you going?

906
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:16,250
Oh, he's going to the Lard Donut.

907
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:16,950
Lard Lad.

908
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:17,950
Okay.

909
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:19,730
I need to... I don't remember where Lard Lad is.

910
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:20,890
Oh, it's right here.

911
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:22,110
All right.

912
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:23,590
Okay.

913
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:25,470
I'm gonna... explore.

914
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:30,470
All right.

915
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:33,730
I can... What is... Why is she running like this?

916
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:34,050
Okay.

917
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:37,370
Now that I know she's over there... Wait.

918
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:39,030
This is just Homer's level.

919
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:39,850
Wait.

920
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,450
I don't get a new level area?

921
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:42,570
That's so lazy.

922
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,370
I can't believe it.

923
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:50,450
That's so lazy in 2003 or whatever, whenever this game came out.

924
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:54,710
I can't believe they couldn't fit more levels.

925
00:48:57,870 --> 00:49:01,350
In 2003, they really phoned it in, guys.

926
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:06,030
But it's night time, Doki.

927
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:08,470
I can't believe it.

928
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:09,270
All right.

929
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:09,870
Let's see.

930
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:12,070
Did I get everything here?

931
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:13,930
I definitely need more coins.

932
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:16,190
All right.

933
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:16,750
Let's see.

934
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:18,450
I want more coins just in case.

935
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:21,990
I don't know if she has, like, actually good clothes, though.

936
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:23,590
Good cosmetic outfits.

937
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:24,970
But we'll see.

938
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:25,370
Oh, hey.

939
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:25,930
Is that Moe?

940
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:26,270
Wait, no.

941
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:26,870
That's not Moe.

942
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:27,510
That's...

943
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:28,590
She's in a dress.

944
00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:30,290
Is there anything...

945
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:31,410
Anything around here?

946
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:32,890
That might be...

947
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:37,570
That might be interesting for me to go.

948
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:39,290
Why does Marge run like that?

949
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:39,750
Look.

950
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:41,950
She's going through a lot, okay?

951
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:44,550
She has three kids that'll never grow up.

952
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:45,670
And one of them's a baby.

953
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:46,790
And...

954
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:50,630
I think that's the worst part.

955
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:53,270
None of them are self-sufficient children.

956
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:56,490
Having three kids really slows you down.

957
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:56,810
Yep.

958
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:57,650
Oh, my God.

959
00:49:57,810 --> 00:49:59,970
Marge, that's exactly what I said.

960
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:00,990
Don't worry, Marge.

961
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:01,690
I got you.

962
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:03,050
I'm here for you.

963
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,650
That's exactly what I said.

964
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,210
I swear I used to be a better runner.

965
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:10,090
Oh, true.

966
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:11,050
And Homer.

967
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,190
I forgot about that.

968
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:13,170
And Homer.

969
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,290
All right, let's go back to Chief Wiggum.

970
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:17,410
All right, Chief.

971
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:18,790
I don't know.

972
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:19,930
I think like...

973
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:23,650
Oh, I feel like really bad for the voice actress for Marge.

974
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:25,190
Because it's just...

975
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:26,610
She sounds...

976
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:27,290
She...

977
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:28,690
I feel like...

978
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:30,410
Do you know they retired Milhouse?

979
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:33,810
Milhouse is retired now as a character.

980
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:36,810
Because the voice actor retired.

981
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:39,210
Or voice actress retired for him.

982
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:41,490
I don't remember if it was a guy or girl that voices him.

983
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:45,550
But like, Marge now is like really sad to hear.

984
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:46,450
Yeah.

985
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:48,370
There's got to be a...

986
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:51,270
Aw, that's cute.

987
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:52,430
I'd love to help.

988
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,450
But I got sugar withdrawal real bad.

989
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:56,010
The donut store is closed.

990
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:58,730
And I got a monkey on my back screaming for Kruller.

991
00:50:59,290 --> 00:50:59,810
Oh.

992
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:01,370
Oh, he's screaming.

993
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:04,530
Wait, why do you have a monkey back there?

994
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:05,670
Wiggum?

995
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:06,950
Hit the donut truck?

996
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:07,430
Oh, shit.

997
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:07,710
Okay.

998
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:09,230
Where is he?

999
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:11,110
All right, don't worry, chief.

1000
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:13,390
I'll commit crime for you.

1001
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:16,630
If I'm committing crime for the cops, it's legal.

1002
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:18,230
All right, don't worry.

1003
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:18,650
Don't worry.

1004
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:20,430
The cops want me to do this.

1005
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:22,470
Don't worry.

1006
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:24,770
I'm doing it for the sake of the police.

1007
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:27,770
Where's your donut?

1008
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:28,770
Where's the item?

1009
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:30,670
Okay, I'll grab that later.

1010
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:32,130
All right, this is bad.

1011
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:33,110
I think I already failed it.

1012
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:36,150
Oh my god.

1013
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:38,230
I forgot about this.

1014
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:39,330
Oh, please.

1015
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:41,570
Oh, I should have got the...

1016
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:42,470
Wait, give me a sec.

1017
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:43,610
I know what to do.

1018
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:46,970
All right, give me a sec, donut man.

1019
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:48,930
I know what to do.

1020
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:50,130
It's time.

1021
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:53,190
It's time for Mr. Plow.

1022
00:51:55,330 --> 00:51:56,110
Don't worry.

1023
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:58,290
I got a real car now.

1024
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:02,930
Mr. Plow, that's my name.

1025
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:04,310
Wait, where did he go?

1026
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:06,570
Hello, donut man?

1027
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:07,950
Whoa, shit.

1028
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:10,250
Donut man, where are you?

1029
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:11,750
Wait, why is he over there?

1030
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:12,750
Jump the ramp.

1031
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:15,030
Why are you scared?

1032
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:17,570
Boom.

1033
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:19,630
Wait, did that work?

1034
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:20,830
Wait, I clouded you.

1035
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:22,210
Oh, shit.

1036
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:23,990
Guys, can you tell that I haven't played in a while?

1037
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:28,410
Oh, please.

1038
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:29,670
Get over here.

1039
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:30,410
I need an idea.

1040
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:32,330
Please.

1041
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:33,470
I need the donut.

1042
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:34,290
Oh, my God.

1043
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:34,790
I can't.

1044
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:35,590
I can't.

1045
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:36,290
I need a restart.

1046
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:38,090
Please, just give me a restart.

1047
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:40,050
I can't right now.

1048
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:40,810
I'm not okay.

1049
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:42,150
Please.

1050
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:43,570
Give me a restart.

1051
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:46,830
Wait, stone cutters.

1052
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:47,410
Oh, shit.

1053
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:49,490
It's the stone cutters.

1054
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:51,430
Oh, my God.

1055
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:53,730
Wait, the stone cutters want some donuts as well?

1056
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:54,690
Okay.

1057
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:55,310
Free money.

1058
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:55,810
Yay.

1059
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:56,650
Oh, fuck.

1060
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:57,470
All right.

1061
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:58,990
Mr. Plot might be a little too big.

1062
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:01,070
Is he...

1063
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:01,490
Is...

1064
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:02,950
Are they actually recasting Milhouse?

1065
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:04,650
I thought they were retiring the character.

1066
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:05,690
Like, they retired.

1067
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:08,590
Um...

1068
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:09,810
Because they retired...

1069
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:13,390
Another character got retired because the voice actor was like...

1070
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:14,170
Wait, do I have to do...

1071
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:14,930
Are you serious?

1072
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:16,390
I have to go to Marjland again?

1073
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:17,890
Oh, my...

1074
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:19,350
Okay, I know when I fucked around.

1075
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:20,830
Oh, no.

1076
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:21,930
We did.

1077
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:25,210
You know, I have the Simpsons soundtrack on my phone.

1078
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:27,850
I actually bought, like, um...

1079
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:30,830
Well, it's like the Simpsons best hits.

1080
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:35,350
I have the Simpsons movie soundtrack and, like, the Simpsons TV show soundtrack.

1081
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:38,750
Oh, please.

1082
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:39,730
Why?

1083
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:41,290
Why do I have to do this again?

1084
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:41,730
It's okay.

1085
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:42,170
He's...

1086
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:42,870
He sits here.

1087
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:44,810
No!

1088
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:45,790
Wait, what's up, Mr. Plow?

1089
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:47,010
All right.

1090
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:47,890
Don't worry.

1091
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:49,190
I got you, Chief.

1092
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:53,670
Legally enforced violence.

1093
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:54,870
That's my favorite part.

1094
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:55,330
Boom.

1095
00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:56,790
All right.

1096
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:57,250
Nice.

1097
00:53:57,730 --> 00:53:59,190
I just need to take him to the corner.

1098
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:00,370
Oh, fuck.

1099
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:01,830
Oh, no.

1100
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:02,610
No!

1101
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:04,350
Give me that one donut!

1102
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:07,350
Get over here!

1103
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:10,850
The cops gave me the right of law!

1104
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:13,890
Wait, where's my donut?

1105
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:15,270
Wait, where's my donut?

1106
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:16,850
Dude, where's my donut?

1107
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:17,590
Oh, there it is.

1108
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:18,690
All right.

1109
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:20,190
Come on, I'm at three.

1110
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:21,830
I'm always halfway.

1111
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:23,450
Give me my donut.

1112
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:24,270
Nice.

1113
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:27,730
Come on.

1114
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:28,550
Donut!

1115
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:30,550
Where is he going?

1116
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:32,510
Oh, shit.

1117
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:33,730
I thought he was gonna go left.

1118
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:36,970
Oh!

1119
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:38,230
Oh, no!

1120
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:39,810
Wait, I can still hit him.

1121
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:41,130
That's allowed.

1122
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:42,650
Okay, nice.

1123
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:44,390
And then...

1124
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:44,550
Fuck.

1125
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:44,870
Okay.

1126
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:45,630
That's fine.

1127
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:47,810
I'll just stop here.

1128
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:49,390
He has to hit me.

1129
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:49,970
Never mind.

1130
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:51,810
Never mind.

1131
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:54,490
Okay, nice.

1132
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:56,450
Okay.

1133
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:57,590
Two more.

1134
00:54:58,930 --> 00:54:59,950
That's right!

1135
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:01,870
Thank you, garbage man!

1136
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:05,230
Boom!

1137
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:06,510
Oh.

1138
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:07,290
Yay!

1139
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:10,290
Wait, I have to drive back?

1140
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:10,590
Trash?

1141
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:11,710
Wait!

1142
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:12,770
It doesn't TP!

1143
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:13,970
I did my job!

1144
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:16,570
How are you so hungry?

1145
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:17,530
Wait, go!

1146
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:19,690
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1147
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:20,590
No, no, no, no, no.

1148
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:21,270
Don't worry.

1149
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:22,130
It's fine.

1150
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:23,230
It's not that far.

1151
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:25,830
It's not that far from home.

1152
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:29,470
We're driving slow and steady in my hit and run.

1153
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:31,490
Okay, this way.

1154
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:36,790
The cops don't really want to catch me yet because I still have like three more hits.

1155
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:38,270
I have...

1156
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:41,650
All right, following traffic laws right now.

1157
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:43,810
I do not want to...

1158
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:44,250
Oh, no.

1159
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:46,010
Guys, I can't get caught.

1160
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:46,990
I can't go back.

1161
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:48,390
I can't go back, guys.

1162
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:51,370
I'm a law-abiding citizen.

1163
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:54,190
All right, where is it?

1164
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:55,250
It's that far?

1165
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:56,730
There's no way I drove that far.

1166
00:55:56,890 --> 00:55:57,670
Oh, shit, no.

1167
00:55:57,990 --> 00:55:59,250
Oh, no, I panicked a little bit.

1168
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:00,510
Oh, my God.

1169
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:01,310
No, there's 33.

1170
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:02,250
No, don't hit me!

1171
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:02,710
Don't hit me!

1172
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:03,530
Okay, that's fine.

1173
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:03,970
That's fine.

1174
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:04,670
Everything's fine.

1175
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:05,470
Yay!

1176
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:06,630
We did it!

1177
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:07,870
I didn't get hit.

1178
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:10,810
I can't go back to prison, guys.

1179
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:12,330
Please.

1180
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:15,770
Boy, for a busybody housewife, you sure get results.

1181
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:18,270
That crop circles at Cletus's shack.

1182
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:22,230
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a truck full of donuts to eat.

1183
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:23,710
I'm gonna need a lot of coffee.

1184
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:26,890
Wait, I needed to ask Wiggum where the crop circle was?

1185
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:28,690
Just read the news.

1186
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:29,950
Oh, wait.

1187
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:32,010
Surely it's a...

1188
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:32,250
It's...

1189
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:33,430
It's Springfield.

1190
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:36,070
You don't have that much shit going on.

1191
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:40,150
All right, let me grab some more coins.

1192
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:44,730
You used to be a cop, Marge.

1193
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:48,370
You should be able to do this detective work without Wiggum.

1194
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:50,430
All right, let me grab...

1195
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:51,210
Oh, nice.

1196
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:52,110
We need this.

1197
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:54,550
Get over here.

1198
00:56:55,850 --> 00:56:57,810
No, no, no, no!

1199
00:56:57,830 --> 00:56:58,550
My coins!

1200
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:00,330
It's okay.

1201
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:01,450
I can get the coins back.

1202
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:04,950
Oh, I can almost afford an outfit.

1203
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:07,570
I can't afford too close for you, Marge!

1204
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:10,690
You don't have to shop at the bargain bin anymore!

1205
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:13,670
Oh, is in-game volume low?

1206
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:14,610
Okay, don't worry, guys.

1207
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:16,870
I need a long island iced tea.

1208
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:19,970
Let me fix the volume real quick for you guys.

1209
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:21,970
Uh, sound...

1210
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:23,950
Oh, did every...

1211
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:24,690
No, nothing reset.

1212
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:25,110
I was like...

1213
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:26,550
I thought the stuff...

1214
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:26,610
Oh.

1215
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:28,350
Uh...

1216
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:30,290
Let me up it a little bit for us.

1217
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:31,650
That's weird.

1218
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:34,590
I put up the old volume from before.

1219
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:36,730
I'll up it up a little bit.

1220
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:40,010
All right, let me know what's better, guys.

1221
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:41,710
Also, sound guys here.

1222
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:42,130
I don't know.

1223
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:44,050
Sound guys didn't say anything.

1224
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:45,510
All right.

1225
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:47,670
I should save.

1226
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:48,650
Don't leave me.

1227
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:50,430
I should really save.

1228
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:52,650
It's not been a very lucky month for me.

1229
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:54,890
I should really save.

1230
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:57,490
All right.

1231
00:57:57,830 --> 00:57:58,770
Uh, where's my car?

1232
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:00,370
Where's my car?

1233
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:02,910
Wait.

1234
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:05,790
Wait, what can I buy here?

1235
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:06,970
The Quicking Mart.

1236
00:58:07,470 --> 00:58:11,450
Oh, everything reset itself because it's like Marge's level and not Homer's.

1237
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:12,090
I just realized.

1238
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:13,790
Let me in.

1239
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:15,610
Do I have anything at the Quicking Mart?

1240
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:17,270
The last time you'll hear a poo.

1241
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:19,090
What grubber chow do you have?

1242
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:22,130
Perhaps this curry pixie stick will suit your fancy.

1243
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:24,530
Oh, hey.

1244
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:25,190
There's Mo Man.

1245
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:26,810
Wait, what's this?

1246
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:28,590
Oh, free money.

1247
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:29,370
Yippee!

1248
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:30,370
Yippee!

1249
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:31,330
Yippee!

1250
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:31,810
My $1!

1251
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:34,190
Yippee!

1252
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:38,530
All right.

1253
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:39,290
Let's see.

1254
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:40,050
What can I buy?

1255
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:42,630
Three hundred dollars to be in Florida?

1256
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:53,690
Oh, it's the classy mo- Oh my god, it's- Oh my god, I told him- If I'm the cop, if I'm the police, I'll never be arrested.

1257
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:59,490
You can't arrest me if I'm the cop.

1258
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:03,610
I have three hundred dollars to fucking pay to jail.

1259
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:05,190
Can I steal the death truck?

1260
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:06,310
No fun.

1261
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:07,870
Give me your money.

1262
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:09,550
I should be able to rob him.

1263
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:13,130
I should be legally allowed to rob these people.

1264
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:16,250
All right.

1265
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:21,870
What?

1266
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:25,210
Damn.

1267
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:32,630
That's not true, look at me now.

1268
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:39,390
Yeah, it was- If woman drivers aren't very good, what do you explain this?

1269
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:39,630
What do you mean this?

1270
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:51,090
Okay, let me grab- Oh, I don't care about that enough.

1271
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:52,910
Wait, what's this?

1272
00:59:53,070 --> 00:59:54,810
Wait, I can go to this room?

1273
00:59:54,810 --> 00:59:55,750
Wait, how do I do that?

1274
00:59:57,370 --> 00:59:58,190
Oh, okay.

1275
00:59:58,410 --> 00:59:59,290
That's not how you do it.

1276
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:03,690
Oh, I could go into Bart's room.

1277
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:07,030
Mommy's here.

1278
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:08,850
Oh, that's so cool.

1279
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:12,330
There's like little Easter eggs and everything in Bart's room.

1280
01:00:16,770 --> 01:00:19,150
Too bad he has nothing in here because we're poor.

1281
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:20,030
We're broke.

1282
01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:26,750
Actually, like, Homer's the richest millennial I've ever known.

1283
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:38,190
Being able to afford for three children and also like two cars and a house in suburbia.

1284
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:40,490
He's living the life.

1285
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:43,850
And he works at a nuclear power plant.

1286
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:45,070
Like, what the fuck?

1287
01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:47,710
Please, where is he?

1288
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:49,810
I don't have... I don't know!

1289
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:53,150
My depth perception isn't working!

1290
01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:57,650
Oh my god, give me a sec, guys.

1291
01:00:57,810 --> 01:00:59,010
I'm trying to figure out...

1292
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:00,150
No, my coins!

1293
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:03,310
All right, there we go.

1294
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:06,710
We don't talk about Bart and Simpson.

1295
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:10,010
Okay, nice.

1296
01:01:11,130 --> 01:01:11,930
All right.

1297
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:17,470
Homer is the millennial of all boomers expected by Simpy.

1298
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:23,550
Oh no, they're about to get raptured.

1299
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:29,370
No, modern Simpsons equals Homer is a millennial now.

1300
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:31,150
Hello, knock knock.

1301
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:34,630
Yes, get ready to get raptured, Ned.

1302
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:39,910
Genuflecting?

1303
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:40,850
The fuck is that?

1304
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,330
I need more step aerobics.

1305
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:47,030
Finally, my videotape of Christian Vegetables is here.

1306
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:48,630
Christian Vegetables?

1307
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:50,110
Videota...

1308
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:51,630
Oh, VeggieTales!

1309
01:01:52,690 --> 01:01:54,530
I was like, the fuck is Christian?

1310
01:01:54,630 --> 01:01:56,150
I forgot VeggieTales!

1311
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:56,890
VeggieTales!

1312
01:01:56,890 --> 01:01:58,070
I used to love VeggieTales.

1313
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:02,330
VeggieTales!

1314
01:02:02,330 --> 01:02:03,010
VeggieTales!

1315
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:04,310
VeggieTales!

1316
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:04,590
VeggieTales!

1317
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:05,350
VeggieTales!

1318
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:05,350
VeggieTales!

1319
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:05,890
Broccoli!

1320
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:07,830
Celery!

1321
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:09,870
Bum-ba-dum!

1322
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:10,890
VeggieTales!

1323
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:14,750
I didn't realize it was based off like religion until I got older.

1324
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:17,210
I just thought they were like silly vegetables.

1325
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:22,590
I should have realized this when they did a tale about like Noah.

1326
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:24,150
Oh yeah!

1327
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:32,950
I realized it was like about like religion when they start- When I watched the- Because I bought the movie DVD of the Noah's art.

1328
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:35,090
Was it Noah or the one- The one with the whale?

1329
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:36,690
No, it wasn't Noah.

1330
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:40,710
It was the one where he got- Uh, Larry got eaten by a whale.

1331
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:43,970
And I realized, wait, is this religion?

1332
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:46,730
Is this- Oh, Jonah!

1333
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:47,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1334
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:50,990
I bought the DVD for Jonah and I was like, oh my god, wait a minute.

1335
01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:54,330
This is about- This is about God!

1336
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:58,930
Oh, hey comic book guy!

1337
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:01,710
Oh, whoops!

1338
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:02,710
What did he want me to do?

1339
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:03,390
I skipped it.

1340
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:06,050
Click all the intercepted gifts, don't let time run out.

1341
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:11,590
I like that I really- It's cause like I really enjoyed the- the songs.

1342
01:03:11,810 --> 01:03:12,570
The silly songs.

1343
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:15,330
So I never fully realized that, um...

1344
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:18,070
Oh wait, I'm gonna get the Kremlin!

1345
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:20,690
I didn't realize it was about God.

1346
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:22,530
I just thought the silly songs were cool.

1347
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:25,930
Alright, let's get- Let me get Abe here.

1348
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:31,460
Alright, I don't remember where- I have to go to where again?

1349
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:32,900
Wait, where's Abe?

1350
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,260
Oh, I have to drive to the school.

1351
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,360
I actually- No, I skipped the dial!

1352
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,900
If I fail the mission- Wait, actually, I just gotta leave the mission.

1353
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,300
So you have a shortcut.

1354
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:48,880
I hope there's not much more.

1355
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,260
Abe, where are you?

1356
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:53,860
Where did he go?

1357
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:55,560
I thought he was gonna drive for me!

1358
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:57,740
Wait, how do I cancel mission?

1359
01:03:58,220 --> 01:03:58,900
Oh, I can!

1360
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:01,020
Okay, let's listen to the- Yeah.

1361
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:01,800
I'm sure.

1362
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:03,160
Okay, I'll come back.

1363
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:06,220
Alright, I want to know what the dialogue was.

1364
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:07,160
I actually pressed skip.

1365
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:10,060
And now it's time for Silly Songs with Larry.

1366
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:12,540
The part of the show where Larry comes out and sing a silly song.

1367
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:13,300
Exactly!

1368
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:16,640
I thought it was just Silly Vegetables!

1369
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:18,460
I didn't realize they were preaching!

1370
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,120
I- I- Ha ha ha ha!

1371
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,080
Lexi, thank you for the Super Chat!

1372
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:23,240
Thank you, thank you!

1373
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:25,720
I like the water buffalo song.

1374
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:29,740
Alright, hello!

1375
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:31,740
Time for some foot-on payment action!

1376
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,160
Alright, comic book, what did you actually want me to do?

1377
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,360
Mr. Guy, what are you doing here?

1378
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:41,840
Well, I've been trying to convince Agnes to come make fun of school children, but she refuses to go out with me.

1379
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:46,940
That son of hers keeps intercepting every gift I send her and hides them at his workplace.

1380
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:48,720
He's a jerk and a fool.

1381
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,280
Why not just go get them back?

1382
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:51,980
I would, but...

1383
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:54,340
Well, I'm not a terribly mobile person.

1384
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:55,600
There, I said it.

1385
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:56,900
Wait, what?

1386
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:58,840
It's not easy being hustled.

1387
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,240
Is he dating Agnes?

1388
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:01,880
Tell you what, I'll take you to ask me.

1389
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:04,040
Oh my god, cougar!

1390
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,360
What a fucking cougar!

1391
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,380
I forgot that...

1392
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:13,360
I forgot back then.

1393
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:16,900
Comic book guy was dating Agnes before he got...

1394
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:18,820
uh, hot Japanese wife.

1395
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:21,800
I forgot...

1396
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:22,480
Oh my god!

1397
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:25,660
I didn't realize he was a freak like that.

1398
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:27,440
I didn't realize he was a gilf.

1399
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:35,510
For a comic book guy, he does have a lot of game.

1400
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:40,570
Okay, I don't...

1401
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:42,210
I don't know that's beyond hags, guys.

1402
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:49,230
Seymour is like 50 or some shit right now.

1403
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:52,970
I gotta go...

1404
01:05:53,930 --> 01:05:55,210
I gotta go...

1405
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:55,650
I gotta go...

1406
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:56,790
Go to the school.

1407
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,610
And pick her up.

1408
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:01,610
All right, let's see...

1409
01:06:01,610 --> 01:06:02,670
Where the fuck is the school?

1410
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:07,290
I've driven around Springfield so many times, I still can't like...

1411
01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:10,090
I still can't like process where everything is.

1412
01:06:11,110 --> 01:06:12,930
I might not be very good at directions.

1413
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:15,770
Just a maybe.

1414
01:06:16,570 --> 01:06:16,830
Hey!

1415
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:18,450
Hey, wait a minute, you hit me!

1416
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:19,930
Where's your insurance?

1417
01:06:22,430 --> 01:06:23,150
Oh wait, what?

1418
01:06:23,290 --> 01:06:24,290
Oh, these are the gifts?

1419
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:25,190
Oh, shit, okay.

1420
01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:27,850
But where are the rest of the gifts?

1421
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:31,410
Wait, what?

1422
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:33,350
Wait, I didn't know!

1423
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:34,670
I didn't know!

1424
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:37,690
The child was on me!

1425
01:06:37,890 --> 01:06:38,890
The child was on me!

1426
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:40,630
The child was on me!

1427
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:43,810
The child fucking stood in front of my car!

1428
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:53,550
How the fuck was I supposed to- How the fuck was I supposed to- She stood in front of my car!

1429
01:06:56,590 --> 01:07:01,750
It was that my fault that she happened to be at the playground!

1430
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:04,010
How was that my fault?

1431
01:07:05,010 --> 01:07:06,550
Drive to me!

1432
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:10,950
The child walked in front of my speeding vehicle!

1433
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:16,210
She was committing insurance fraud!

1434
01:07:17,930 --> 01:07:18,810
Look at that!

1435
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:20,790
Get out of the way, child!

1436
01:07:22,730 --> 01:07:26,050
Oh no, I have to do this mission again because of this child.

1437
01:07:26,450 --> 01:07:27,490
It's all his fault.

1438
01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:28,430
Wait, is that underwear?

1439
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:29,750
Is that edible underwear?

1440
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:31,890
No.

1441
01:07:32,410 --> 01:07:33,550
No, we're so close!

1442
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:35,710
No, I have to do a jump!

1443
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,650
We were so close!

1444
01:07:38,810 --> 01:07:39,410
No!

1445
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:42,130
Wait a minute.

1446
01:07:43,170 --> 01:07:44,530
Okay, I can drive back there.

1447
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:45,310
That's fine.

1448
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:47,930
Alright.

1449
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:50,570
Those are great gifts.

1450
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:53,030
He's speaking from experience.

1451
01:07:54,790 --> 01:07:57,450
Wouldn't, like, edible underwear be, like, sticky?

1452
01:07:58,650 --> 01:08:02,450
Like, what kind of- Like, what is it made out of?

1453
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:04,330
I feel like that'd be so uncomfortable.

1454
01:08:07,110 --> 01:08:07,910
Like, please.

1455
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:11,090
Don't keep stop.

1456
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:15,550
Like, I'm saying, like, what- What is edible, like, underwear even made of?

1457
01:08:16,650 --> 01:08:17,390
Oh, shit.

1458
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:18,050
No, it's fine.

1459
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:19,010
I have two more tries.

1460
01:08:19,890 --> 01:08:20,210
I have two more tries.

1461
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:21,070
Copper, I told you!

1462
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:23,170
The child was committing insurance fraud!

1463
01:08:25,610 --> 01:08:28,330
She stood in front of my car!

1464
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:32,570
Okay, it's over here.

1465
01:08:33,330 --> 01:08:35,050
All right, collect the number of gifts.

1466
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:37,690
Okay, we got her a pair of new dentures.

1467
01:08:38,370 --> 01:08:43,010
And then, we gotta go into the Springfield Elementary School.

1468
01:08:43,770 --> 01:08:44,810
All right, there's Willie!

1469
01:08:45,230 --> 01:08:45,870
Hey, Willie!

1470
01:08:46,230 --> 01:08:47,550
Wait, Willie got married, too!

1471
01:08:49,290 --> 01:08:57,730
I feel like the new plot line for, like, um, for, like, Modern Simpsons is that everybody's just getting married right now.

1472
01:08:57,730 --> 01:09:08,030
Yeah, he's- he got married to, like, he's apparently, like, some fucking prodigy was sniffing out truffles or some shit.

1473
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:16,810
And then, like, the plot line is that, um, the plot line of the- Oh, shit.

1474
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:19,910
Sorry, I need to figure out where the other- where his other gifts are.

1475
01:09:20,010 --> 01:09:22,950
Wait, I'm missing, like, where is it?

1476
01:09:23,070 --> 01:09:24,130
Where's the last gift?

1477
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:26,330
Wait, where is it?

1478
01:09:26,950 --> 01:09:28,290
Oh, no, let's do this again.

1479
01:09:28,490 --> 01:09:30,310
Oh, no, I don't know where the last one is.

1480
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:31,770
Wait, where is it?

1481
01:09:31,950 --> 01:09:32,510
Is it Buzz?

1482
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:38,330
Wait, where- Oh, it's the other side of the roof!

1483
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:38,910
Oh, no!

1484
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:40,250
Oh, I'm blind!

1485
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:43,070
I'm fucking- I didn't realize it was also on the roof!

1486
01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:44,950
No, I can't jump!

1487
01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:47,570
How do I get there?

1488
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:49,710
How do I parkour?

1489
01:09:50,790 --> 01:09:52,270
Wait, how do I get to the roof?

1490
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:55,350
Oh, my God!

1491
01:09:56,410 --> 01:10:01,110
The gamers don't know how- I don't know how to get up there!

1492
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:03,830
Oh, I was on the wrong side.

1493
01:10:03,970 --> 01:10:04,110
Okay.

1494
01:10:04,650 --> 01:10:12,190
Okay, but yeah, the entire plot line of the- Guys, I actually watch Modern Simpsons because, like, um, I'm all about the brain rot.

1495
01:10:12,190 --> 01:10:21,890
Um, um, um, but, like, I am a connoisseur of, like, um, animated- animated TV shows.

1496
01:10:22,130 --> 01:10:30,090
So I actually watch, like, uh, actually watch Modern Simpsons, so I'm, like- I caught up to, like, the last two or three seasons of Modern Simpsons.

1497
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:39,410
So, yeah, the- most of the newer plot lines of Modern Simpsons is, like, a lot of your favorite Simpsons characters are, like, now married or have, like, kids or something.

1498
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:45,450
And, um, I remember it's, like, what was it?

1499
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:48,890
Oh, and then Flanders is now severely depressed.

1500
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:53,850
That's- that's the best I could describe it.

1501
01:10:54,230 --> 01:11:00,810
Like, Flanders' new character development is that he's just incredibly depressed now.

1502
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:08,270
Um, like, you know how he's, like, howdy-loo, neighborino, and all of them, like, you know, I love my family, and, like, God.

1503
01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:12,550
But now, like, now he's just incredibly fucking depressed.

1504
01:11:12,730 --> 01:11:16,970
Like, I mean, to be fair, both his wives did die.

1505
01:11:16,970 --> 01:11:20,810
So, like, you know, you can't really be happy anymore about that.

1506
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:26,730
But, like, every new storyline they do with Flanders, he's just, like, he's not okay.

1507
01:11:27,190 --> 01:11:32,250
He- at one point, he became, like, some sort of, like, um...

1508
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:33,510
Okay, wait, let me- No!

1509
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:42,390
At one point, he became, like, like, um, like a fugitive or something.

1510
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:48,630
They had, like, this weird-ass storyline with Flanders, where, like, he became a fugitive because his dad...

1511
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:52,190
You know, like, before, they're, like, oh yeah, his dad's a hippie.

1512
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:54,290
And then they, like...

1513
01:11:54,290 --> 01:11:55,310
Wait, where- where is it?

1514
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:55,510
Oh.

1515
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:57,550
And then they, like, um...

1516
01:11:58,770 --> 01:11:59,610
What's the word called?

1517
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:07,250
They, like, retconned it, and now his dad is, like, a police officer, but, like, a corrupted police officer.

1518
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:10,850
So, like, I- I don't know why they- they retconned that.

1519
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:13,930
Like, you know, his dad was supposed to be a fucking hippie, but now it's not.

1520
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:20,550
Like, like, his dad is now, uh, a corrupted police officer.

1521
01:12:20,990 --> 01:12:23,390
And, uh, I know I'm still on a timer.

1522
01:12:23,570 --> 01:12:24,390
Don't worry, I can get there.

1523
01:12:24,930 --> 01:12:26,170
I'm gonna get there in time.

1524
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:27,870
Oh, was it his grandpa?

1525
01:12:28,030 --> 01:12:29,390
No, it wasn't- it was his grandpa.

1526
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:30,390
Oh, his grandpa!

1527
01:12:30,650 --> 01:12:30,910
Okay.

1528
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:39,090
His grandpa is now- his grandpa is a corrupted- Oh my god, I didn't realize it was his grandpa, because he- his grandpa was so fucking young.

1529
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:42,970
Oh yeah, so they retconned the fact that his grandpa is a corrupted police officer now.

1530
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:45,650
Um, who- I thought it was his dad.

1531
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:47,390
I thought that was, like, talking about his dad.

1532
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:48,270
Um.

1533
01:12:50,110 --> 01:12:55,030
But, yeah, and then, like, they had, like, this really weird storyline- Oh no, I think- guys, I don't think I'm gonna make it, guys.

1534
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:55,530
Oh no.

1535
01:12:55,770 --> 01:12:57,830
Guys- guys, why did you stop it?

1536
01:12:59,190 --> 01:12:59,510
Guys!

1537
01:13:00,150 --> 01:13:01,690
Why did you stop it?

1538
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:02,590
I thought I had time!

1539
01:13:03,230 --> 01:13:07,470
I- It's not my fault.

1540
01:13:15,870 --> 01:13:18,190
Okay, okay, this time- I can do that.

1541
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:19,870
This time I'll pay attention.

1542
01:13:22,090 --> 01:13:24,470
I was following traffic laws!

1543
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:25,530
It's not my fault!

1544
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:28,770
You- you just seem really confident, Dookie.

1545
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:34,470
I- I- I- I- I- I failed the yap.

1546
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:37,510
Why is he so far?

1547
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:42,710
If you wanna see your- your guilt, you gotta move closer to home.

1548
01:13:45,670 --> 01:13:46,690
Look, you're right.

1549
01:13:46,770 --> 01:13:48,890
It's not my- it's not your fault.

1550
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:50,490
It's our fault, okay?

1551
01:13:50,830 --> 01:13:52,790
Look, we share the blame together.

1552
01:13:53,290 --> 01:13:54,350
It's our channel.

1553
01:13:58,330 --> 01:13:58,770
Okay.

1554
01:13:59,650 --> 01:14:00,190
There we go.

1555
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:01,710
Seijian, thank you for the super chat.

1556
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:02,870
Thank you, thank you.

1557
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:05,730
All right.

1558
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:06,690
There we go.

1559
01:14:07,450 --> 01:14:08,330
Oh, we got this.

1560
01:14:13,130 --> 01:14:14,530
This is a group effort.

1561
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:15,490
Oh my god.

1562
01:14:15,950 --> 01:14:16,590
Oh my god.

1563
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:17,070
Don't worry.

1564
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:17,930
Don't worry.

1565
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:18,370
It's fine.

1566
01:14:18,530 --> 01:14:19,370
Everything is fine.

1567
01:14:19,610 --> 01:14:20,790
I just gotta park my car.

1568
01:14:21,450 --> 01:14:22,470
Don't worry, Willy.

1569
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:23,910
Don't worry.

1570
01:14:24,270 --> 01:14:26,090
This is a very important mission.

1571
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:27,650
For the- wait, how did he get over there?

1572
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:29,790
You're right.

1573
01:14:29,850 --> 01:14:30,830
This is Vladimir's fault.

1574
01:14:32,350 --> 01:14:33,070
Oh my god.

1575
01:14:33,150 --> 01:14:34,630
Maybe I should have drove around for this.

1576
01:14:34,830 --> 01:14:37,670
I forgot how slow- How slow I am.

1577
01:14:38,790 --> 01:14:39,490
Oh no.

1578
01:14:39,710 --> 01:14:40,390
We're so fine.

1579
01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:43,130
Don't worry.

1580
01:14:43,210 --> 01:14:44,030
Everything is fine.

1581
01:14:46,230 --> 01:14:48,330
I might have- I should have parked a little closer again.

1582
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:52,390
I might have fucked up by not parking a little closer.

1583
01:14:57,390 --> 01:14:58,150
But yeah, anyway.

1584
01:14:58,250 --> 01:15:03,730
In that episode, he like was running from- Like, it got like super fucking weird.

1585
01:15:03,890 --> 01:15:06,750
Because it got like- They were parodying- What was it called?

1586
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:09,290
Uh- Fargo or some shit?

1587
01:15:09,410 --> 01:15:10,870
Yeah, they were parodying the Fargo.

1588
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:11,410
Fargo episode.

1589
01:15:12,650 --> 01:15:15,470
Wait, is there like a phone- Telephone booth there?

1590
01:15:15,690 --> 01:15:16,410
Yes, there is.

1591
01:15:16,530 --> 01:15:17,690
Okay, I can just call another car.

1592
01:15:18,110 --> 01:15:19,930
I need more step aerobics classes.

1593
01:15:20,190 --> 01:15:20,890
Okay, nice.

1594
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:22,610
Uh...

1595
01:15:22,610 --> 01:15:23,330
What's fast?

1596
01:15:23,550 --> 01:15:24,050
What's fast?

1597
01:15:25,650 --> 01:15:26,110
Uh...

1598
01:15:26,830 --> 01:15:29,750
What's the fast- What car do I have that's fast?

1599
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:33,090
Oh, I'm going backwards.

1600
01:15:33,870 --> 01:15:34,390
Okay.

1601
01:15:35,190 --> 01:15:36,730
My Malibu Stacy car.

1602
01:15:37,370 --> 01:15:38,010
All right, Lisa.

1603
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:41,550
Some people are famous for their ability to drive from an early age.

1604
01:15:41,730 --> 01:15:43,530
All right, see, I told you.

1605
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:46,610
Now women drivers aren't bad, Marge.

1606
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:47,050
Nice girls.

1607
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:48,070
Finish fast.

1608
01:15:48,070 --> 01:15:49,590
See, look at that.

1609
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:54,390
We're fast, but we might not be the best drivers, but we're fast.

1610
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:56,450
Okay.

1611
01:15:57,110 --> 01:16:00,330
Wait, the timer- The timing didn't stop was looking through cards!

1612
01:16:00,330 --> 01:16:01,610
I just realized!

1613
01:16:03,990 --> 01:16:06,830
I was like- I thought I had a long time!

1614
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:08,710
I didn't even know what car to get!

1615
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:11,270
I- Oh, no.

1616
01:16:11,450 --> 01:16:12,330
Can I say you guys want to try this?

1617
01:16:12,410 --> 01:16:13,310
You guys want to do this again?

1618
01:16:14,850 --> 01:16:16,890
How the fuck was I supposed- Oh, no.

1619
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:17,510
Oh, no.

1620
01:16:17,730 --> 01:16:18,830
And I'm going to get gold!

1621
01:16:19,170 --> 01:16:19,990
No, my money!

1622
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:20,930
No!

1623
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:22,030
No!

1624
01:16:22,030 --> 01:16:26,430
And- I got- My money!

1625
01:16:28,610 --> 01:16:30,110
And I lost $50!

1626
01:16:30,110 --> 01:16:30,210
$50!

1627
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:33,510
It's not fair.

1628
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:34,910
Oh my god, I made it!

1629
01:16:35,070 --> 01:16:36,070
Wait, it got me closer!

1630
01:16:36,350 --> 01:16:38,410
It got me closer to the objective!

1631
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:39,670
Oh my god!

1632
01:16:39,950 --> 01:16:40,470
Speedrun!

1633
01:16:43,210 --> 01:16:44,150
Speedrun tech!

1634
01:16:46,010 --> 01:16:46,950
Tactical arrest!

1635
01:16:52,930 --> 01:16:53,770
Peta win!

1636
01:16:54,170 --> 01:16:54,750
Let's go!

1637
01:17:00,970 --> 01:17:02,070
Oh, guys.

1638
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:03,010
It was intentional.

1639
01:17:06,550 --> 01:17:10,630
Guys, like I said, everything is always intentional, guys.

1640
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:13,070
Let's go!

1641
01:17:13,390 --> 01:17:14,010
Peta win!

1642
01:17:14,410 --> 01:17:15,950
I love Peta win!

1643
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:20,810
Any episode of Simpsons that made you cry or at least emotional?

1644
01:17:22,290 --> 01:17:22,690
Um...

1645
01:17:23,150 --> 01:17:24,230
I'm trying to remember.

1646
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:31,930
There was- There was a Simpsons episode that really, really- I think- I think it's when- It's a Flanders episode.

1647
01:17:31,950 --> 01:17:33,430
It's when he started getting more depressed.

1648
01:17:34,510 --> 01:17:34,910
Um...

1649
01:17:36,050 --> 01:17:41,950
It's- Um, for those who, like- It's- It's actually the modern- It's one of the modern Simpsons episodes.

1650
01:17:42,350 --> 01:17:45,090
And, like, it's the one where there's, like, clips of it.

1651
01:17:45,210 --> 01:17:56,950
Some of you guys might have seen the- Some of you guys might have seen the clips of it, but it was when he talks about how it's harder to believe- believe in God because, like, he keeps having really fucked up things happening to him.

1652
01:17:57,130 --> 01:18:00,510
And, like, you know, how his two wives have died and stuff like that.

1653
01:18:01,450 --> 01:18:01,910
So...

1654
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:04,050
Um...

1655
01:18:04,050 --> 01:18:14,950
But that's, like, one of my- my favorite- Like, that's one of my- not favorite episodes, but one of my more emotional episodes that really, like- Alright, let's go- I need to go- buy clothes.

1656
01:18:15,570 --> 01:18:16,470
I gotta be a cop.

1657
01:18:17,810 --> 01:18:18,550
Yeah, that one.

1658
01:18:18,710 --> 01:18:22,470
That one was, like, one of my, like, more emotional episodes.

1659
01:18:23,770 --> 01:18:26,110
Yeah, that one was, like, so touchy-feely.

1660
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:40,530
And then, any ep- any episode- And if I wanna say, like, my favorite classic Simpson episodes that, like- that are, like- Well, not like, but, like, more, like, made me very emotional was- Yeah, I'm driving backwards because I need to buy my clothes.

1661
01:18:40,670 --> 01:18:41,330
I need to buy clothes.

1662
01:18:41,570 --> 01:18:42,490
I need to be a cop.

1663
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:46,070
It's when, um- Which one was it?

1664
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:53,450
It's when, uh- Homer, uh- Um- Wait, Homer's mom left him again.

1665
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:56,190
That one was really- That one was a good episode.

1666
01:18:57,730 --> 01:18:58,070
Alright.

1667
01:18:58,390 --> 01:18:59,950
Let's go buy a clothes.

1668
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:03,750
Yeah, the one where Homer's- Homer's mom dies.

1669
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:08,530
I hate the- I hate the episodes where they bring her back in the modern Simpsons.

1670
01:19:08,730 --> 01:19:09,690
Those ones, I don't like.

1671
01:19:09,690 --> 01:19:10,790
And they, like, retcon it.

1672
01:19:11,050 --> 01:19:14,010
They're like, Here's another way that Homer's mom disappeared.

1673
01:19:14,270 --> 01:19:19,790
Even though, like, you know, they never- I don't like that they kept trying to add, like, more storyline to Homer's mom.

1674
01:19:20,190 --> 01:19:23,170
Because I felt like the way it ended was, like, the best way it could have ended.

1675
01:19:25,370 --> 01:19:25,730
Alright.

1676
01:19:27,370 --> 01:19:30,690
They can't catch- I can't get arrested if I'm a cop.

1677
01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:37,150
They didn't, like, retcon- They didn't retcon her.

1678
01:19:37,330 --> 01:19:41,350
They more, like, they tried to add more storylines to her right after she died.

1679
01:19:41,550 --> 01:19:42,270
And I didn't like that.

1680
01:19:46,090 --> 01:19:46,490
Alright.

1681
01:19:46,630 --> 01:19:47,610
Let's go back to Cletus.

1682
01:19:47,870 --> 01:19:48,010
Alright.

1683
01:19:48,570 --> 01:19:52,530
Gonna have my daughter drive me to- Guys, it's perfectly legal.

1684
01:19:52,730 --> 01:19:55,010
See, she has a designated driver next to her.

1685
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:56,770
She's getting her learner's permit.

1686
01:19:56,970 --> 01:19:59,250
She's so- She's, like- You know how she's so smart?

1687
01:19:59,250 --> 01:20:02,710
She has the IQ of, like, at least, like, a 20-year-old.

1688
01:20:03,990 --> 01:20:10,050
So I'm, like, her- Like, you know, like, learner's permit where you have a guardian next to you?

1689
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:10,870
It's okay.

1690
01:20:12,050 --> 01:20:12,550
Mentally.

1691
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:14,390
Mentally, she's at least 20.

1692
01:20:15,810 --> 01:20:17,270
So it's perfectly legal.

1693
01:20:17,510 --> 01:20:18,650
And her mom's a cop.

1694
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:20,990
Would a cop do illegal things?

1695
01:20:25,930 --> 01:20:27,290
It's not a crime!

1696
01:20:27,310 --> 01:20:28,970
Marge actually was a cop!

1697
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:31,210
It's not her fault that she kept the uniform!

1698
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:36,270
Alright.

1699
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:37,310
Hello, Cletus.

1700
01:20:37,870 --> 01:20:38,630
Excuse me?

1701
01:20:38,850 --> 01:20:41,010
I don't care if you is from New York.

1702
01:20:41,230 --> 01:20:46,410
You ain't taking pictures of our decrappitude for no magazine, no way.

1703
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:48,150
No, Cletus, it's me!

1704
01:20:48,370 --> 01:20:49,630
It's me, Marge!

1705
01:20:50,350 --> 01:20:50,870
Marge!

1706
01:20:53,030 --> 01:20:54,750
Follow Cletus and collect what flowers from...

1707
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:55,390
Don't miss any...

1708
01:20:55,390 --> 01:20:56,210
Wait, what is he collecting?

1709
01:20:57,410 --> 01:20:58,170
Where's Cletus?

1710
01:20:58,950 --> 01:20:59,910
Oh, he's back here!

1711
01:21:00,130 --> 01:21:00,710
Oh, shit!

1712
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:02,450
Whoops!

1713
01:21:02,950 --> 01:21:04,430
Alright, I had to run her over.

1714
01:21:04,590 --> 01:21:05,930
You ha- You don't understand.

1715
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:08,410
She was in the way- Oh my god!

1716
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:09,330
Get out of the way!

1717
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,240
I'm trying to run over somebody!

1718
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:14,800
Perfectly legal, though.

1719
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:15,720
Perfectly legal.

1720
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:17,960
I'm a cop.

1721
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:21,060
Alright, it's fine.

1722
01:21:21,220 --> 01:21:21,380
It's fine.

1723
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:22,580
Oh my god, he's so far.

1724
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:22,960
He's actually so far away.

1725
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:24,560
He's actually so far away.

1726
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:25,540
Where did he go?

1727
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:26,680
Where did he go?

1728
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:27,980
He's so...

1729
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:29,900
Where did he go?

1730
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:32,060
Alright.

1731
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:33,640
It's fine.

1732
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:34,380
I don't know.

1733
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:37,620
Oh, I had to follow and collect his stuff?

1734
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:38,240
So I can't...

1735
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:39,680
He can't, like, be gone.

1736
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:41,980
Wait, why didn't you drop anything?

1737
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:42,580
I hit you.

1738
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:44,540
Oh, wait.

1739
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:44,920
What?

1740
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:45,900
He's dropping...

1741
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:46,840
Oh, wait!

1742
01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:48,940
He's dropping stuff on his own!

1743
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:50,460
I don't have to hit him!

1744
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:51,700
You shouldn't enjoy that.

1745
01:21:51,860 --> 01:21:52,580
Okay, that's good.

1746
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:53,520
He's...

1747
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:57,120
He's leaving, like, a little breadcrumbe trail for me.

1748
01:21:57,740 --> 01:21:58,460
Yeah, it dropped...

1749
01:21:58,460 --> 01:21:59,720
I just noticed it drops randomly.

1750
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:00,840
I was like, how did it...

1751
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:02,340
How did he drop stuff?

1752
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:04,040
Without me doing anything.

1753
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:05,700
Come on.

1754
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:06,280
Drop it.

1755
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:07,040
Drop it.

1756
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:07,820
Drop it.

1757
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:09,780
I need some road ready.

1758
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:10,760
I'm right here.

1759
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:12,120
Drop it.

1760
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:13,500
Drop it.

1761
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:14,080
Stay here.

1762
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:15,600
Wait, wait.

1763
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:16,240
If I...

1764
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:16,540
Okay.

1765
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:17,500
I can't leave now.

1766
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:19,680
I can't leave.

1767
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:21,420
I can't.

1768
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:22,120
Just drop it.

1769
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:23,220
Just drop...

1770
01:22:23,220 --> 01:22:23,740
What?

1771
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:24,720
What?

1772
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:26,320
What?

1773
01:22:26,620 --> 01:22:27,520
That's illegal!

1774
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:29,000
Wait, what the...

1775
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:33,700
How did he do that?

1776
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:34,900
How did he...

1777
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:37,700
How did he fucking do that?

1778
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:46,280
Aliens.

1779
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:48,820
What the fuck?

1780
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:50,120
That's cheating!

1781
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:53,180
Oh, no.

1782
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:54,560
Oh, no.

1783
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:55,340
Oh, no.

1784
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:56,000
I'm backwards.

1785
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:57,260
I'm backwards.

1786
01:22:58,460 --> 01:23:00,040
He no-clipsed.

1787
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:02,240
I thought I had him.

1788
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:04,300
The redneck magic.

1789
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:06,860
Alright.

1790
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:08,200
This time.

1791
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:09,240
This time I got this.

1792
01:23:09,660 --> 01:23:09,720
Alright.

1793
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:09,980
Nice.

1794
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:10,680
Oh, it's cola!

1795
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:15,850
Alright.

1796
01:23:15,990 --> 01:23:16,250
Don't worry.

1797
01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:16,830
I'm right here.

1798
01:23:17,250 --> 01:23:18,650
Bro, face through reality.

1799
01:23:18,930 --> 01:23:20,090
Are we in a video game?

1800
01:23:21,490 --> 01:23:22,510
There's no way.

1801
01:23:22,710 --> 01:23:24,050
I thought this is real life.

1802
01:23:26,470 --> 01:23:26,890
Alright.

1803
01:23:27,050 --> 01:23:27,270
Nice.

1804
01:23:27,590 --> 01:23:27,690
Okay.

1805
01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:28,490
He dropped apples.

1806
01:23:28,910 --> 01:23:29,090
Wait.

1807
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:29,350
No.

1808
01:23:29,410 --> 01:23:30,510
He's just dropping random shit.

1809
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:34,810
This is the fat guy.

1810
01:23:34,810 --> 01:23:35,870
This is the fat guy.

1811
01:23:35,870 --> 01:23:35,890
This is the fat...

1812
01:23:35,890 --> 01:23:38,470
My child's car is the fastest car I own, guys.

1813
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:40,330
Alright.

1814
01:23:40,470 --> 01:23:40,730
Nice.

1815
01:23:41,210 --> 01:23:41,610
Don't worry.

1816
01:23:42,170 --> 01:23:42,490
Don't worry.

1817
01:23:42,570 --> 01:23:44,130
I'm pretty sure Mr. Burns has insurance.

1818
01:23:44,410 --> 01:23:44,870
Right, guys?

1819
01:23:45,330 --> 01:23:50,270
The richest man in Springfield surely has provided good healthcare for his employees.

1820
01:23:53,290 --> 01:23:54,970
Is he just grocery shopping?

1821
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:57,810
I'm just picking up his groceries right now.

1822
01:23:58,510 --> 01:23:58,590
Ha!

1823
01:23:58,870 --> 01:23:59,130
Aww.

1824
01:23:59,590 --> 01:24:00,270
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1825
01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:02,290
I am so totally embarrassed.

1826
01:24:03,650 --> 01:24:04,870
Are you okay, Clintus?

1827
01:24:05,050 --> 01:24:05,310
Wait.

1828
01:24:05,370 --> 01:24:06,530
What if I lock him in again?

1829
01:24:07,570 --> 01:24:08,550
There you go.

1830
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:09,770
There you go.

1831
01:24:09,870 --> 01:24:10,430
You can't...

1832
01:24:10,430 --> 01:24:11,210
Can't get...

1833
01:24:11,210 --> 01:24:11,670
There you go.

1834
01:24:12,910 --> 01:24:14,270
Nice girls finish face.

1835
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:16,050
Oh, no.

1836
01:24:16,150 --> 01:24:16,850
I fucked up again.

1837
01:24:17,150 --> 01:24:17,590
I...

1838
01:24:18,490 --> 01:24:19,030
It's okay.

1839
01:24:19,050 --> 01:24:19,890
I can drive backwards.

1840
01:24:21,950 --> 01:24:22,630
That's fine.

1841
01:24:23,770 --> 01:24:24,490
This works.

1842
01:24:26,130 --> 01:24:26,870
Oh, no.

1843
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:27,430
No.

1844
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:28,970
No.

1845
01:24:29,290 --> 01:24:29,730
No.

1846
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:31,910
Why did I decide to be cocky?

1847
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:32,290
No.

1848
01:24:34,730 --> 01:24:35,170
Wait.

1849
01:24:35,230 --> 01:24:35,330
Wait.

1850
01:24:35,410 --> 01:24:35,510
Wait.

1851
01:24:35,510 --> 01:24:36,230
This is fixable.

1852
01:24:36,490 --> 01:24:37,330
This is fixable.

1853
01:24:39,190 --> 01:24:40,390
This is so fixable.

1854
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:42,150
Come back here.

1855
01:24:42,330 --> 01:24:42,990
Oh, my God.

1856
01:24:43,150 --> 01:24:43,330
Please.

1857
01:24:43,410 --> 01:24:43,810
Where is he?

1858
01:24:43,810 --> 01:24:45,110
Clintus, where are you?

1859
01:24:45,610 --> 01:24:46,230
Just please.

1860
01:24:46,230 --> 01:24:47,090
Hit something.

1861
01:24:47,330 --> 01:24:47,630
Anything.

1862
01:24:48,370 --> 01:24:48,770
Oh, no.

1863
01:24:49,110 --> 01:24:49,290
Oh, no.

1864
01:24:49,370 --> 01:24:50,630
He's driving well now.

1865
01:24:50,810 --> 01:24:51,250
Oh, no.

1866
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:52,050
It's okay.

1867
01:24:52,090 --> 01:24:53,190
I'll grab that item back later.

1868
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:54,490
I'll grab it later.

1869
01:24:54,690 --> 01:24:55,570
I'll grab it later.

1870
01:24:55,850 --> 01:24:56,310
It's okay.

1871
01:24:56,490 --> 01:24:57,130
I'll grab...

1872
01:24:57,130 --> 01:24:57,470
No!

1873
01:24:59,890 --> 01:25:02,150
I thought I could grab it later.

1874
01:25:04,290 --> 01:25:04,730
Alright.

1875
01:25:05,290 --> 01:25:05,730
It's okay.

1876
01:25:05,890 --> 01:25:06,270
It's okay.

1877
01:25:06,390 --> 01:25:07,070
I learned now.

1878
01:25:07,410 --> 01:25:08,890
I'm not cocky anymore.

1879
01:25:09,510 --> 01:25:11,650
I love the hardcore banjo.

1880
01:25:12,130 --> 01:25:13,530
During this day, give us a super chat.

1881
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:13,890
Thank you.

1882
01:25:13,990 --> 01:25:14,570
Thank you.

1883
01:25:14,830 --> 01:25:15,230
Thank you.

1884
01:25:15,230 --> 01:25:16,270
Tokyo, are you so...

1885
01:25:16,270 --> 01:25:16,750
Thank you, guys.

1886
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:18,810
Do you guys notice how good I am at video games?

1887
01:25:19,210 --> 01:25:21,190
Breezy, thank you for the super chat.

1888
01:25:21,390 --> 01:25:21,770
Thank you.

1889
01:25:21,890 --> 01:25:22,010
Thank you.

1890
01:25:22,110 --> 01:25:27,090
You can tell, like, at what point in my life where I didn't play these certain games.

1891
01:25:27,430 --> 01:25:29,970
Where I didn't grow up with certain games, guys.

1892
01:25:29,970 --> 01:25:35,130
You can, you can tell exactly where I was at that point on the life.

1893
01:25:39,270 --> 01:25:41,650
I never played both of that tax...

1894
01:25:41,650 --> 01:25:47,490
I never played, like, taxi games or, like, any sort of, like, driving games back in the day.

1895
01:25:47,490 --> 01:25:48,410
I...

1896
01:25:53,070 --> 01:25:55,470
You can tell exactly where it started.

1897
01:25:56,570 --> 01:25:57,970
The crazy taxi...

1898
01:25:57,970 --> 01:25:59,690
I actually never grew up with crazy taxi.

1899
01:26:02,330 --> 01:26:08,810
I grew up with, like, my dad's video games and, like, all he used, all he played was just, like, shooters.

1900
01:26:09,410 --> 01:26:11,870
Like, Call of Duty, Medal of Honor.

1901
01:26:12,510 --> 01:26:14,590
Anything that's related to the wars.

1902
01:26:17,530 --> 01:26:18,130
All right.

1903
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:19,130
Don't worry.

1904
01:26:19,290 --> 01:26:20,490
I'm not fucking around this time.

1905
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:22,530
I figured it out.

1906
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:24,790
But that's why I love streaming.

1907
01:26:25,130 --> 01:26:31,070
I love streaming so I can, like, experience this, this part of my life, this part of life that I never got to experience growing up.

1908
01:26:31,730 --> 01:26:34,890
Because I know there's, like, a lot of, like, childhood games for everybody.

1909
01:26:36,010 --> 01:26:37,230
Let's get harder, Doki.

1910
01:26:37,370 --> 01:26:39,630
This still isn't the worst of it.

1911
01:26:40,190 --> 01:26:44,710
That's why, like, streaming has led me, like, play games I never had a chance to play growing up.

1912
01:26:46,930 --> 01:26:48,010
She was a TF2.

1913
01:26:48,150 --> 01:26:48,570
I was...

1914
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:49,270
Okay, no, that's...

1915
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:49,790
That's a lie.

1916
01:26:50,010 --> 01:26:52,350
I was in the TM Fortress 2 fandom.

1917
01:26:52,630 --> 01:26:53,950
But I didn't, like...

1918
01:26:53,950 --> 01:26:56,610
I never played the game of Team Fortress 2.

1919
01:26:57,150 --> 01:26:58,610
Like, I played, like...

1920
01:26:58,610 --> 01:26:58,870
I...

1921
01:26:58,870 --> 01:26:59,290
Oh, no.

1922
01:26:59,450 --> 01:26:59,830
Oh, no.

1923
01:26:59,930 --> 01:27:00,410
Oh, no.

1924
01:27:00,550 --> 01:27:01,450
I fucked around.

1925
01:27:02,070 --> 01:27:02,730
Oh, no.

1926
01:27:02,890 --> 01:27:03,350
Oh, no.

1927
01:27:03,410 --> 01:27:03,670
It's okay.

1928
01:27:03,790 --> 01:27:04,050
Cletus.

1929
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:06,930
Cletus is still driving nice and slow, right, Cletus?

1930
01:27:07,210 --> 01:27:08,370
Cletus, wait, hold up.

1931
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:09,530
Cletus, Cletus.

1932
01:27:09,630 --> 01:27:09,890
No!

1933
01:27:10,310 --> 01:27:11,930
I didn't have a lap...

1934
01:27:11,930 --> 01:27:14,450
I didn't have a gaming PC or a gaming laptop.

1935
01:27:14,770 --> 01:27:18,770
So when I tried to play Team Fortress 2 with, like, the orange box.

1936
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:19,210
When I...

1937
01:27:19,210 --> 01:27:20,890
When I had the orange box.

1938
01:27:21,890 --> 01:27:22,330
Um...

1939
01:27:22,330 --> 01:27:22,730
Oh, my God.

1940
01:27:22,790 --> 01:27:23,290
I'm back here.

1941
01:27:23,510 --> 01:27:23,810
Yay!

1942
01:27:25,710 --> 01:27:26,150
Tourist!

1943
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:29,290
When I had the orange box.

1944
01:27:29,470 --> 01:27:30,450
And I tried to install...

1945
01:27:30,450 --> 01:27:32,030
Install it on my...

1946
01:27:32,530 --> 01:27:32,970
Um...

1947
01:27:32,970 --> 01:27:33,230
P...

1948
01:27:33,230 --> 01:27:33,530
Lap...

1949
01:27:33,530 --> 01:27:33,970
My laptop.

1950
01:27:34,270 --> 01:27:35,310
It wasn't a gaming laptop.

1951
01:27:35,650 --> 01:27:36,590
So I got, like...

1952
01:27:36,590 --> 01:27:38,490
And I wasn't really a gamer back then.

1953
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:39,930
I tried to play on touchpad.

1954
01:27:39,930 --> 01:27:40,590
I...

1955
01:27:40,590 --> 01:27:40,990
I...

1956
01:27:40,990 --> 01:27:41,090
I...

1957
01:27:41,090 --> 01:27:41,410
I...

1958
01:27:41,410 --> 01:27:41,570
I...

1959
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:42,410
I have to help me.

1960
01:27:42,550 --> 01:27:45,090
I have to find out what happened to my baby boy.

1961
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:46,510
I'm sorry.

1962
01:27:46,710 --> 01:27:48,670
I thought you was a city slicker.

1963
01:27:48,990 --> 01:27:50,830
But I ain't telling you nothing.

1964
01:27:51,050 --> 01:27:53,190
Listen, you help us with the harvest.

1965
01:27:53,470 --> 01:27:53,910
Harvest?

1966
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:54,470
The harvest?

1967
01:27:54,890 --> 01:27:55,930
I'm going to be doing...

1968
01:27:55,930 --> 01:27:57,990
Yeah, I tried to play Team Fortress 2 on touchpad.

1969
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:04,410
Don't get your clothes dirty.

1970
01:28:04,590 --> 01:28:05,290
Purchase March...

1971
01:28:05,290 --> 01:28:05,590
No!

1972
01:28:08,410 --> 01:28:08,810
Wait.

1973
01:28:09,430 --> 01:28:10,430
I have to buy...

1974
01:28:10,430 --> 01:28:11,890
I have to legally be...

1975
01:28:11,890 --> 01:28:13,350
Pay money to be in...

1976
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:14,530
Just arrest me.

1977
01:28:14,690 --> 01:28:15,770
Just fucking arrest me.

1978
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:16,650
It's the same thing.

1979
01:28:17,130 --> 01:28:18,850
Like, why do I have to pay to be in jail?

1980
01:28:19,070 --> 01:28:19,470
Just...

1981
01:28:19,470 --> 01:28:20,690
Just put me in jail.

1982
01:28:25,530 --> 01:28:26,950
I know you played...

1983
01:28:26,950 --> 01:28:27,690
Spyro the Dragon.

1984
01:28:27,830 --> 01:28:29,910
But have you ever played other cool platformer classics?

1985
01:28:30,150 --> 01:28:30,550
Like...

1986
01:28:30,550 --> 01:28:31,330
Crash Bandicoot.

1987
01:28:31,430 --> 01:28:32,570
I played Crash Bandicoot.

1988
01:28:32,570 --> 01:28:34,450
I loved the Crash Bandicoot when I was growing up.

1989
01:28:35,150 --> 01:28:35,570
Um...

1990
01:28:35,570 --> 01:28:37,210
I had, like, the Spyro games.

1991
01:28:37,390 --> 01:28:38,190
And also...

1992
01:28:38,190 --> 01:28:40,530
I played almost all the Spyro games.

1993
01:28:40,650 --> 01:28:41,530
Even the bad ones.

1994
01:28:43,090 --> 01:28:44,510
Like, if you guys remember...

1995
01:28:44,510 --> 01:28:46,370
Some of the really bad Spyro games.

1996
01:28:46,490 --> 01:28:47,230
Where, like...

1997
01:28:48,030 --> 01:28:48,470
Sparks...

1998
01:28:49,450 --> 01:28:50,330
Sparks started...

1999
01:28:50,330 --> 01:28:52,190
Sparks was voiced by Ligia Wood.

2000
01:28:54,390 --> 01:28:56,310
And he was super fucking buff.

2001
01:28:56,630 --> 01:28:58,010
And, um...

2002
01:28:58,010 --> 01:28:59,530
He was super fucking buff.

2003
01:28:59,690 --> 01:29:01,450
And he was able to talk and stuff.

2004
01:29:01,610 --> 01:29:03,410
I played even those Spyro games.

2005
01:29:03,530 --> 01:29:05,590
I played every single iteration of Spyro.

2006
01:29:05,690 --> 01:29:06,850
Except for Skylanders.

2007
01:29:06,930 --> 01:29:07,830
Because fuck Skylanders.

2008
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:08,550
I'm sorry.

2009
01:29:09,210 --> 01:29:09,770
Like...

2010
01:29:09,770 --> 01:29:11,230
Like, I did not want...

2011
01:29:11,230 --> 01:29:13,730
I did not want my Spyro to have...

2012
01:29:13,730 --> 01:29:14,490
To be ugly.

2013
01:29:15,010 --> 01:29:15,430
I...

2014
01:29:17,590 --> 01:29:19,050
I also bought the...

2015
01:29:19,050 --> 01:29:21,370
I also played the Cinderverse games too.

2016
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:23,610
The Spyro when he had a girlfriend.

2017
01:29:23,970 --> 01:29:24,690
Or has a girlfriend.

2018
01:29:26,590 --> 01:29:28,350
Can't believe I had to pay...

2019
01:29:28,350 --> 01:29:28,990
To go to jail.

2020
01:29:31,210 --> 01:29:32,270
Can't believe it.

2021
01:29:33,650 --> 01:29:35,390
I can't just wear my cop clothes.

2022
01:29:38,690 --> 01:29:39,750
I never played Sky...

2023
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:41,430
I know a lot of people love Skylanders.

2024
01:29:41,430 --> 01:29:42,270
But, like...

2025
01:29:42,270 --> 01:29:42,570
They...

2026
01:29:42,570 --> 01:29:44,050
They ruined Spyro for me.

2027
01:29:44,170 --> 01:29:44,950
Like, I couldn't...

2028
01:29:44,950 --> 01:29:46,290
I couldn't deal with that.

2029
01:29:46,510 --> 01:29:47,510
Not my Spyro.

2030
01:29:51,990 --> 01:29:52,450
Okay.

2031
01:29:52,490 --> 01:29:53,230
Get into the car.

2032
01:29:53,410 --> 01:29:53,570
Alright.

2033
01:29:53,870 --> 01:29:54,270
Cletus.

2034
01:29:54,450 --> 01:29:56,410
Help Cletus harvest ketchup packets for the...

2035
01:29:56,890 --> 01:29:57,350
Winter!

2036
01:29:57,350 --> 01:29:58,430
Just go to Krusty...

2037
01:29:59,090 --> 01:30:00,270
Just go to, like...

2038
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:01,170
Krusty Burger.

2039
01:30:01,650 --> 01:30:03,390
Why not to harvest them?

2040
01:30:04,230 --> 01:30:06,230
It was so ugly in Skylander.

2041
01:30:06,350 --> 01:30:06,430
Yeah.

2042
01:30:06,430 --> 01:30:08,530
And then they made Crash Bandicoot talk.

2043
01:30:08,710 --> 01:30:09,450
It was so weird.

2044
01:30:10,410 --> 01:30:10,510
Alright.

2045
01:30:10,650 --> 01:30:11,470
Don't worry, Cletus.

2046
01:30:13,630 --> 01:30:14,430
Don't worry.

2047
01:30:14,770 --> 01:30:14,910
Oh, wait.

2048
01:30:14,990 --> 01:30:15,610
I have...

2049
01:30:15,610 --> 01:30:16,510
I'm timed?

2050
01:30:17,630 --> 01:30:18,950
Who's timing me?

2051
01:30:20,370 --> 01:30:21,810
The ketchup police?

2052
01:30:23,150 --> 01:30:23,710
Yeah.

2053
01:30:23,730 --> 01:30:24,810
They made him Australian.

2054
01:30:27,890 --> 01:30:28,450
Alright.

2055
01:30:28,550 --> 01:30:28,990
Here we go.

2056
01:30:31,370 --> 01:30:34,010
The slowest ramp jump of my life.

2057
01:30:35,230 --> 01:30:35,790
Alright.

2058
01:30:36,430 --> 01:30:38,710
There's a lot of dumpsters around here somewheres.

2059
01:30:39,370 --> 01:30:40,650
Oh, my God.

2060
01:30:40,650 --> 01:30:41,130
Please.

2061
01:30:42,670 --> 01:30:44,530
Why is your car so...

2062
01:30:44,530 --> 01:30:47,430
Why were you so fast when I had to chase you?

2063
01:30:47,590 --> 01:30:48,810
But you're so slow now.

2064
01:30:50,130 --> 01:30:50,810
Wee.

2065
01:30:51,730 --> 01:30:53,370
I don't understand.

2066
01:30:55,190 --> 01:30:56,730
Oh, my God.

2067
01:30:56,930 --> 01:30:57,210
Leave.

2068
01:30:57,650 --> 01:30:58,230
Get out.

2069
01:31:00,710 --> 01:31:01,390
Alright.

2070
01:31:01,390 --> 01:31:01,870
Nice.

2071
01:31:02,350 --> 01:31:02,630
Here we go.

2072
01:31:02,950 --> 01:31:03,110
Here.

2073
01:31:04,530 --> 01:31:05,210
Wee.

2074
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:07,250
I'm flying like a turkey.

2075
01:31:07,830 --> 01:31:08,050
Oh, no.

2076
01:31:08,170 --> 01:31:08,670
It's this way.

2077
01:31:09,290 --> 01:31:09,890
It's okay.

2078
01:31:12,290 --> 01:31:12,690
Okay.

2079
01:31:12,830 --> 01:31:14,850
But it's your fault for standing in my way, children.

2080
01:31:16,550 --> 01:31:17,690
I'm not out of touch.

2081
01:31:17,990 --> 01:31:18,850
It's the children's fault.

2082
01:31:19,970 --> 01:31:20,370
Okay.

2083
01:31:20,370 --> 01:31:20,930
It's this way.

2084
01:31:21,050 --> 01:31:22,230
I'm gonna make it, right?

2085
01:31:22,730 --> 01:31:23,350
No, I will.

2086
01:31:23,810 --> 01:31:24,150
Alright.

2087
01:31:24,230 --> 01:31:25,490
I just need to drive a little faster now.

2088
01:31:28,430 --> 01:31:28,770
Alright.

2089
01:31:30,350 --> 01:31:31,770
Where the fuck is the other ketchup?

2090
01:31:32,770 --> 01:31:33,430
Where is it?

2091
01:31:34,090 --> 01:31:34,430
Wait.

2092
01:31:34,550 --> 01:31:35,110
Where the fuck...

2093
01:31:35,110 --> 01:31:35,910
Where's the other ketchup?

2094
01:31:36,930 --> 01:31:37,270
Guys.

2095
01:31:37,310 --> 01:31:38,210
I might not make it.

2096
01:31:38,490 --> 01:31:38,830
I...

2097
01:31:40,090 --> 01:31:41,710
Where the fuck is the other ketchup?

2098
01:31:41,890 --> 01:31:42,510
Oh, my God.

2099
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:42,850
Wait.

2100
01:31:43,010 --> 01:31:43,590
Where is it?

2101
01:31:47,490 --> 01:31:48,350
Is it up here?

2102
01:31:49,030 --> 01:31:50,270
Oh, my God.

2103
01:31:50,470 --> 01:31:52,250
It's up a fucking ramp.

2104
01:31:53,150 --> 01:31:54,790
How was I supposed to...

2105
01:31:54,790 --> 01:31:55,650
Oh, my God.

2106
01:31:55,690 --> 01:31:56,690
I was supposed to make it.

2107
01:31:57,150 --> 01:31:57,530
I...

2108
01:31:58,330 --> 01:31:58,810
I...

2109
01:31:58,810 --> 01:32:00,290
I was supposed to...

2110
01:32:00,290 --> 01:32:00,970
Okay.

2111
01:32:00,970 --> 01:32:02,670
This is like the slowest...

2112
01:32:02,670 --> 01:32:03,910
The slowest...

2113
01:32:03,910 --> 01:32:05,730
I can't get driving of my life.

2114
01:32:05,930 --> 01:32:07,070
It's not my fault.

2115
01:32:07,070 --> 01:32:08,670
It's Sakaar's fault, guys.

2116
01:32:11,310 --> 01:32:11,850
Guys.

2117
01:32:11,850 --> 01:32:12,970
I swear to God.

2118
01:32:12,970 --> 01:32:13,730
It's not me.

2119
01:32:13,910 --> 01:32:14,510
It's Sakaar.

2120
01:32:14,730 --> 01:32:16,050
I swear to God.

2121
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:19,050
Here we go.

2122
01:32:21,810 --> 01:32:22,350
Alright.

2123
01:32:22,430 --> 01:32:22,750
There we go.

2124
01:32:22,850 --> 01:32:23,990
I figured it out, guys.

2125
01:32:25,030 --> 01:32:26,370
I figured it out.

2126
01:32:26,790 --> 01:32:29,550
He didn't ketchup.

2127
01:32:31,250 --> 01:32:31,750
Alright.

2128
01:32:32,470 --> 01:32:34,210
But sometimes it's not a stunt.

2129
01:32:34,470 --> 01:32:35,830
How was I supposed to do?

2130
01:32:36,270 --> 01:32:36,990
Here we go.

2131
01:32:37,070 --> 01:32:37,750
Yeah.

2132
01:32:39,010 --> 01:32:39,610
Alright.

2133
01:32:40,070 --> 01:32:40,990
Are you serious?

2134
01:32:41,330 --> 01:32:42,010
Oh, my God.

2135
01:32:42,190 --> 01:32:43,630
You drive right!

2136
01:32:45,970 --> 01:32:46,570
Okay.

2137
01:32:46,950 --> 01:32:47,650
It's okay.

2138
01:32:47,650 --> 01:32:48,510
I figured this out.

2139
01:32:48,830 --> 01:32:50,190
I know the route now.

2140
01:32:52,570 --> 01:32:53,170
Yippee!

2141
01:32:55,210 --> 01:32:55,810
Okay.

2142
01:32:57,010 --> 01:32:58,050
Oh, my God.

2143
01:32:58,110 --> 01:32:58,890
This has to be...

2144
01:32:58,890 --> 01:33:00,610
This car is actually so hard to drive.

2145
01:33:01,630 --> 01:33:02,970
I don't understand.

2146
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:05,250
He was so fast before.

2147
01:33:05,690 --> 01:33:06,270
He was...

2148
01:33:06,270 --> 01:33:07,850
How are you so fast before?

2149
01:33:11,050 --> 01:33:11,630
Oh, my God.

2150
01:33:11,730 --> 01:33:13,110
I barely made that jump.

2151
01:33:15,190 --> 01:33:15,530
Okay.

2152
01:33:16,350 --> 01:33:16,610
Come on.

2153
01:33:16,710 --> 01:33:17,070
Make the jump.

2154
01:33:17,130 --> 01:33:17,570
Make the jump.

2155
01:33:17,670 --> 01:33:18,030
Make the jump.

2156
01:33:18,110 --> 01:33:18,470
Make the jump.

2157
01:33:18,630 --> 01:33:18,830
Make the...

2158
01:33:18,830 --> 01:33:19,050
No!

2159
01:33:19,450 --> 01:33:20,710
How did I miss?

2160
01:33:22,810 --> 01:33:24,470
How did I miss?

2161
01:33:26,550 --> 01:33:28,030
I was driving.

2162
01:33:28,450 --> 01:33:30,190
I followed the ramp.

2163
01:33:30,850 --> 01:33:32,290
Are you serious?

2164
01:33:33,230 --> 01:33:34,490
Where is it?

2165
01:33:38,030 --> 01:33:38,810
Oh, my God.

2166
01:33:38,870 --> 01:33:39,190
Oh, my God.

2167
01:33:41,710 --> 01:33:42,130
Okay.

2168
01:33:44,650 --> 01:33:45,490
Okay, guys.

2169
01:33:45,790 --> 01:33:46,230
Oh, no.

2170
01:33:46,350 --> 01:33:47,690
My car is about to explode.

2171
01:33:47,690 --> 01:33:53,570
Don't... I hit one thing and my guy... and my guy is about to slow.

2172
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:58,810
Guys, okay, I'm gonna... No, no, I will not go around the point!

2173
01:33:59,310 --> 01:34:00,890
You can't bait me!

2174
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:10,490
Just go around!

2175
01:34:11,090 --> 01:34:15,310
Don't you just... Just go around!

2176
01:34:15,490 --> 01:34:17,030
How do you...

2177
01:34:18,150 --> 01:34:19,310
Guys, it's not my fault.

2178
01:34:19,390 --> 01:34:19,870
It's the car.

2179
01:34:20,070 --> 01:34:20,570
It's the car.

2180
01:34:23,190 --> 01:34:25,550
It's like how Marge... Go around!

2181
01:34:26,770 --> 01:34:28,490
Guys, you're just like Marge.

2182
01:34:28,530 --> 01:34:29,470
You don't believe in me.

2183
01:34:29,550 --> 01:34:33,030
I'm basically Homer, and you're the wife that doesn't believe in me.

2184
01:34:33,330 --> 01:34:33,770
Marge!

2185
01:34:37,950 --> 01:34:41,130
I just need a supportive wife to believe in me.

2186
01:34:41,430 --> 01:34:43,950
This is why... This is why Homer...

2187
01:34:44,790 --> 01:34:47,430
This is why Homer can't, like, reach his potential.

2188
01:34:47,690 --> 01:34:48,970
Marge never believes in him.

2189
01:34:50,050 --> 01:34:51,710
Real and true.

2190
01:34:54,810 --> 01:34:57,210
Why can't you believe in me?

2191
01:35:00,990 --> 01:35:01,590
Alright.

2192
01:35:02,550 --> 01:35:03,150
Nice.

2193
01:35:03,470 --> 01:35:04,150
Look at that.

2194
01:35:04,150 --> 01:35:06,310
Look at that stunt that I just performed.

2195
01:35:06,870 --> 01:35:08,210
You wish you could do that.

2196
01:35:10,830 --> 01:35:12,410
I didn't fail!

2197
01:35:12,410 --> 01:35:14,210
It was the car's fault!

2198
01:35:14,770 --> 01:35:17,930
It's not a fail, and it's, like, not my fault.

2199
01:35:18,930 --> 01:35:19,590
Whee!

2200
01:35:21,650 --> 01:35:23,410
This time...

2201
01:35:23,850 --> 01:35:24,730
This time...

2202
01:35:24,730 --> 01:35:25,610
I got the momentum!

2203
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:26,510
Woo!

2204
01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:28,890
Oh my god, I made it!

2205
01:35:29,410 --> 01:35:29,910
Oh!

2206
01:35:31,770 --> 01:35:33,430
I told you!

2207
01:35:33,610 --> 01:35:34,790
I told you!

2208
01:35:34,790 --> 01:35:36,370
You just gotta believe!

2209
01:35:37,630 --> 01:35:39,910
Why couldn't you just believe?

2210
01:35:39,910 --> 01:35:41,030
Oh wait, I'm in...

2211
01:35:41,030 --> 01:35:41,850
Wait, Mr. Burr...

2212
01:35:41,850 --> 01:35:43,110
I go to Mr. Burr's house?

2213
01:35:43,730 --> 01:35:44,090
Nice.

2214
01:35:46,130 --> 01:35:48,310
Okay, and then I left Mr. Burr's house.

2215
01:35:48,590 --> 01:35:49,650
Oh, is this back to...

2216
01:35:49,650 --> 01:35:51,150
Oh wait, it's this human chessboard!

2217
01:35:52,130 --> 01:35:54,170
Wait, is this back to, like...

2218
01:35:55,550 --> 01:35:55,910
Um...

2219
01:35:55,910 --> 01:35:57,550
Oh wait, this is, like, secret!

2220
01:35:58,610 --> 01:35:59,870
Wait, how do I...

2221
01:36:00,350 --> 01:36:01,310
How do I get there?

2222
01:36:03,450 --> 01:36:03,810
Wait...

2223
01:36:03,810 --> 01:36:04,070
What?

2224
01:36:05,590 --> 01:36:07,010
Oh my god...

2225
01:36:07,010 --> 01:36:08,430
Wait, how do I get there?

2226
01:36:08,790 --> 01:36:09,710
Wait, no!

2227
01:36:10,190 --> 01:36:11,310
That is...

2228
01:36:13,870 --> 01:36:14,490
Wait...

2229
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:15,330
No.

2230
01:36:15,630 --> 01:36:15,990
No.

2231
01:36:16,530 --> 01:36:16,630
No.

2232
01:36:16,790 --> 01:36:17,410
No!

2233
01:36:19,890 --> 01:36:21,360
There was a turd!

2234
01:36:22,190 --> 01:36:23,110
I just...

2235
01:36:23,110 --> 01:36:24,010
Oh my...

2236
01:36:27,580 --> 01:36:27,980
Turd!

2237
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:30,960
I can't believe it.

2238
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:32,840
Okay.

2239
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:34,020
This is fine.

2240
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:34,460
This is fine.

2241
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,440
I figured it out now.

2242
01:36:35,980 --> 01:36:37,240
I figured it out.

2243
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:39,120
If you didn't believe...

2244
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:40,880
It's gonna turn it around.

2245
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:43,380
How was I supposed to know?

2246
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:46,360
It was my first time at Mr. Burr's house!

2247
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:50,260
Oh my god, I like knocked her out of the car.

2248
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:51,900
Alright, here we go.

2249
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:53,180
This time I got it, guys.

2250
01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:54,820
I got it.

2251
01:36:55,620 --> 01:36:58,840
This has got to be a supportive wife and believe in my...

2252
01:36:58,840 --> 01:36:59,840
Just believe it.

2253
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:03,080
Believe in my adventures and my antics.

2254
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:04,740
I just...

2255
01:37:04,740 --> 01:37:06,020
Yeah, I understand it now, guys.

2256
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:07,320
Wee!

2257
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:08,320
It's...

2258
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:10,800
I'm basically getting free money every time I break the window, too!

2259
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:12,460
Free money!

2260
01:37:12,780 --> 01:37:14,060
It's my free money hack.

2261
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:16,920
Oh my god.

2262
01:37:17,260 --> 01:37:17,940
Oh my god.

2263
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:18,200
Okay.

2264
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:21,840
Guys, we might have, like, bumped into several things.

2265
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:24,000
But, like, it's okay.

2266
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:25,760
Just a couple of hurdles.

2267
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:29,680
Alright.

2268
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:30,780
We go this way.

2269
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:32,080
Guys, we will at least...

2270
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:34,420
We will complete at least Marge's level.

2271
01:37:34,740 --> 01:37:37,380
Like, I missed the ramp.

2272
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:39,040
I forgot all about the ramp.

2273
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:40,380
I forgot all about the ramp.

2274
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:42,940
I forgot all about the ramp.

2275
01:37:43,660 --> 01:37:43,900
I...

2276
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:45,060
Let's get it.

2277
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:46,040
Just keep on believing!

2278
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:48,120
Keep on believing, guys!

2279
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:49,300
I have enough speed!

2280
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:49,680
Speed!

2281
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:51,140
I told you.

2282
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:52,160
I told you.

2283
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:53,180
I had enough speed.

2284
01:37:53,660 --> 01:37:53,940
I...

2285
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:55,220
No, it's not over yet!

2286
01:37:55,820 --> 01:37:57,320
It's not over yet!

2287
01:37:59,540 --> 01:38:01,280
Guys, it's not over yet!

2288
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:04,520
I can do this in 20 seconds!

2289
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:06,360
There you go!

2290
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:06,840
16!

2291
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:08,640
Okay, where's the ramp?

2292
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:09,620
Where's the ramp?

2293
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:10,880
Where's the ramp?

2294
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:13,220
Where's the ramp?

2295
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:13,620
Where is it?

2296
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:16,200
Oh my god.

2297
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:17,180
Oh my god.

2298
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:18,040
9 seconds.

2299
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:18,800
Right here.

2300
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:19,500
Right here.

2301
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:19,880
Right now.

2302
01:38:19,980 --> 01:38:20,540
I'm gonna make it.

2303
01:38:20,860 --> 01:38:21,140
I...

2304
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:30,280
Everyone better stay here!

2305
01:38:31,060 --> 01:38:31,520
Okay.

2306
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:35,580
Look, I got a little too excited.

2307
01:38:35,780 --> 01:38:36,420
I got it.

2308
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:37,200
Okay.

2309
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:38,660
I got...

2310
01:38:38,660 --> 01:38:40,680
Now that I know.

2311
01:38:40,980 --> 01:38:43,140
Now that I know where to...

2312
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:44,100
I know where to go now!

2313
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:46,200
Guys, I know where to go now!

2314
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:48,280
No, no, no you guys!

2315
01:38:48,420 --> 01:38:49,580
I know where to go!

2316
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:50,820
It'll be fine.

2317
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:51,480
It'll be fine!

2318
01:38:51,860 --> 01:38:54,500
Thank you for this super chat, thank you, Thank you!

2319
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:57,120
Guys, it's all...

2320
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:58,140
It's trial and error!

2321
01:38:58,140 --> 01:38:59,400
It's traveling there.

2322
01:39:00,180 --> 01:39:01,000
It's the car.

2323
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:02,040
It's the car, I believe.

2324
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:03,960
It's literally... it's the car, guys.

2325
01:39:04,120 --> 01:39:05,580
It's such a slow car.

2326
01:39:09,660 --> 01:39:10,060
Okay.

2327
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:11,040
We gotta get that.

2328
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:11,720
Alright, alright.

2329
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:12,880
Guys, it's the car.

2330
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:17,080
They have to... they have to increase the hitbox.

2331
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:17,980
It's not my fault.

2332
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:20,600
Alright.

2333
01:39:22,940 --> 01:39:24,180
No, no, no, Marge.

2334
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:24,640
No, no, no.

2335
01:39:24,700 --> 01:39:25,840
It's the car, Marge.

2336
01:39:25,980 --> 01:39:26,380
Stop.

2337
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:26,780
Stop.

2338
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:28,080
You gotta keep believing, Marge.

2339
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:30,100
It's not you, it's the car.

2340
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:32,680
Alright.

2341
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:33,640
Woo!

2342
01:39:34,940 --> 01:39:36,920
Okay, and then I know there's a ramp, right?

2343
01:39:37,220 --> 01:39:38,260
Guys, just believe.

2344
01:39:38,860 --> 01:39:39,740
Just believe.

2345
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:40,600
Woo!

2346
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:41,880
I'm gonna make it!

2347
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:42,260
Woo!

2348
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:42,980
Look at that!

2349
01:39:43,180 --> 01:39:45,640
I've consistently made it every time!

2350
01:39:48,580 --> 01:39:49,160
Okay, look.

2351
01:39:49,260 --> 01:39:52,360
And I have, like, at least 40 seconds now instead of 20.

2352
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:55,460
Remember when I had, like, 20 seconds and I still made it?

2353
01:39:56,460 --> 01:39:57,620
Now I have even more.

2354
01:39:59,220 --> 01:39:59,580
Okay.

2355
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:01,800
Alright, this is fine.

2356
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:04,660
Okay.

2357
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:06,220
Okay.

2358
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:07,940
Alright.

2359
01:40:08,440 --> 01:40:09,060
I'm gonna time it.

2360
01:40:13,630 --> 01:40:14,990
I'm gonna make it!

2361
01:40:15,410 --> 01:40:15,670
Yeah!

2362
01:40:15,870 --> 01:40:16,110
Ah!

2363
01:40:17,430 --> 01:40:17,730
Ah!

2364
01:40:17,730 --> 01:40:19,290
Oh, I'm trying to drive to clean up his house!

2365
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:20,170
Where does he live?

2366
01:40:20,450 --> 01:40:21,090
Oh, no.

2367
01:40:21,270 --> 01:40:21,430
Okay.

2368
01:40:21,570 --> 01:40:22,370
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2369
01:40:23,030 --> 01:40:23,470
Wait, wait.

2370
01:40:23,490 --> 01:40:24,050
I can make this.

2371
01:40:24,570 --> 01:40:25,510
I can make this.

2372
01:40:25,670 --> 01:40:26,250
Oh, no.

2373
01:40:27,030 --> 01:40:28,090
I can make it.

2374
01:40:28,530 --> 01:40:29,550
I can make it.

2375
01:40:30,110 --> 01:40:31,250
Get away from the black sedan.

2376
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:32,230
I can make it.

2377
01:40:32,850 --> 01:40:33,850
I can make it.

2378
01:40:33,910 --> 01:40:35,110
I just gotta drive.

2379
01:40:37,310 --> 01:40:37,710
Oh, no.

2380
01:40:37,710 --> 01:40:38,370
Sorry about that.

2381
01:40:38,390 --> 01:40:38,830
Oh, no.

2382
01:40:39,090 --> 01:40:39,490
No!

2383
01:40:41,330 --> 01:40:42,810
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2384
01:40:43,170 --> 01:40:44,250
No, this is not fair.

2385
01:40:44,530 --> 01:40:45,450
This is not fair.

2386
01:40:45,710 --> 01:40:47,050
Somebody hit the black car!

2387
01:40:48,610 --> 01:40:50,190
Somebody hit the black car!

2388
01:40:51,070 --> 01:40:51,930
Oh, I did it.

2389
01:40:52,050 --> 01:40:52,290
Nice.

2390
01:40:52,970 --> 01:40:53,250
Okay.

2391
01:40:53,930 --> 01:40:54,630
Alright, it's fine.

2392
01:40:54,770 --> 01:40:55,830
Drive to clean his house still.

2393
01:40:56,770 --> 01:40:57,430
Oh, no!

2394
01:40:57,770 --> 01:40:58,430
No, no, no, no, no!

2395
01:40:58,430 --> 01:40:58,550
No!

2396
01:41:01,570 --> 01:41:02,410
It's fine.

2397
01:41:02,810 --> 01:41:03,150
It's fine.

2398
01:41:03,670 --> 01:41:04,210
I...

2399
01:41:04,210 --> 01:41:05,150
That's why...

2400
01:41:05,150 --> 01:41:05,730
This is why...

2401
01:41:05,730 --> 01:41:07,830
Guys, this is why I failed the mission several times.

2402
01:41:07,830 --> 01:41:08,830
So I could get more money.

2403
01:41:11,490 --> 01:41:12,290
It's okay.

2404
01:41:12,570 --> 01:41:15,770
That's why I purposely failed the mission several times.

2405
01:41:15,830 --> 01:41:18,810
So I could get the money to pay my bail.

2406
01:41:19,070 --> 01:41:20,010
I told you.

2407
01:41:20,130 --> 01:41:21,410
It's all coming together.

2408
01:41:21,410 --> 01:41:21,530
There.

2409
01:41:21,550 --> 01:41:22,110
Now.

2410
01:41:22,750 --> 01:41:25,830
You might and should ask some other old folks about it.

2411
01:41:26,150 --> 01:41:27,650
Maybe try around the graveyard.

2412
01:41:28,170 --> 01:41:28,630
Wait, what?

2413
01:41:28,870 --> 01:41:29,650
Thanks, Cletus.

2414
01:41:30,130 --> 01:41:30,670
Twerent nothing.

2415
01:41:31,410 --> 01:41:32,270
How about...

2416
01:41:32,270 --> 01:41:33,610
I have to go to the cemetery?

2417
01:41:34,610 --> 01:41:35,930
Trust the process, guys.

2418
01:41:36,290 --> 01:41:37,490
Always trust the process.

2419
01:41:37,830 --> 01:41:38,670
Always trust...

2420
01:41:39,890 --> 01:41:41,910
Everything I do, there's a plan.

2421
01:41:42,350 --> 01:41:43,950
Do the grand things of life.

2422
01:41:44,150 --> 01:41:45,290
There's always a plan.

2423
01:41:45,930 --> 01:41:46,770
Guys, don't worry.

2424
01:41:48,550 --> 01:41:50,170
I always have a plan.

2425
01:41:56,390 --> 01:41:58,770
I pretend to be bad at the game now.

2426
01:41:59,310 --> 01:42:02,310
So that when I do the harder levels, you guys are gonna be like, Whoa.

2427
01:42:04,690 --> 01:42:05,790
Guys, it's all...

2428
01:42:09,650 --> 01:42:13,670
I'm only at step two in my 25 step plan.

2429
01:42:14,250 --> 01:42:16,110
Guys, this is only step two.

2430
01:42:18,910 --> 01:42:19,390
Alright.

2431
01:42:22,210 --> 01:42:25,950
I'm sandbagging, so when we're at level five, you be like, Whoa.

2432
01:42:26,130 --> 01:42:27,090
Oh, Doki.

2433
01:42:27,270 --> 01:42:28,650
When did you learn to do that?

2434
01:42:32,660 --> 01:42:33,480
Alright, here we go.

2435
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:34,420
We gotta go this way.

2436
01:42:36,460 --> 01:42:38,140
Guys, I wanna be a cop again.

2437
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:39,220
Let me be a cop.

2438
01:42:40,580 --> 01:42:41,680
Wait, hello, Mo Man.

2439
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:42,840
Hans Mo Man!

2440
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:46,900
Wait, why do I have to talk to Mo Man?

2441
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:54,900
What?

2442
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:58,940
What?

2443
01:42:59,100 --> 01:42:59,420
What curfew?

2444
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:02,480
What...

2445
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:03,400
What did you do?

2446
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:04,760
I see the crop circle.

2447
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:05,960
Talk to Abe.

2448
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:08,440
He mentioned crop circles once.

2449
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:12,060
Hurry up and get to the home before the police lock the doors.

2450
01:43:12,380 --> 01:43:12,880
Oh!

2451
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:15,420
The retirement home curfew!

2452
01:43:15,820 --> 01:43:17,680
Wait, they locked the retirement?

2453
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:19,220
Oh my god, that's pretty fucked.

2454
01:43:20,380 --> 01:43:22,860
They locked the retirement home.

2455
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:24,040
Oh no.

2456
01:43:24,900 --> 01:43:27,040
You don't want the elderly to get...

2457
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:30,620
I mean, no wonder they have to, guys.

2458
01:43:30,940 --> 01:43:34,740
The elderly, they commit crime if you don't lock them up.

2459
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,880
You're not very good at this.

2460
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:43,040
Yeah, I can't let the elderly roam around and commit crime, guys.

2461
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:44,440
Okay.

2462
01:43:45,380 --> 01:43:46,220
Where I got this.

2463
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:47,660
I'm a professional.

2464
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:48,440
You're not very good at this.

2465
01:43:48,820 --> 01:43:50,760
Yeah, they get freaky in there.

2466
01:43:50,940 --> 01:43:51,800
Oh wait, I already did it.

2467
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:53,280
Wait, come...

2468
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:54,020
Where am I?

2469
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,400
Waste the retirement home!

2470
01:43:56,900 --> 01:43:58,400
They have nothing to lose!

2471
01:43:58,560 --> 01:43:59,080
Exactly!

2472
01:44:00,900 --> 01:44:02,820
They have nothing else to lose!

2473
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:03,900
Hello Abe.

2474
01:44:06,820 --> 01:44:09,240
If I kill him, I don't have to pay for his...

2475
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,560
Stay at the retirement!

2476
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:13,580
Abe, I need to talk to you.

2477
01:44:17,240 --> 01:44:17,760
Whoops!

2478
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:17,840
Whoops!

2479
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:18,460
Sorry!

2480
01:44:19,660 --> 01:44:21,100
It was all an accident.

2481
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:23,860
I could take life insurance out of him.

2482
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:25,520
Do you know anything about crop circles?

2483
01:44:25,940 --> 01:44:26,220
What?

2484
01:44:26,700 --> 01:44:26,980
Huh?

2485
01:44:27,140 --> 01:44:29,120
I can't tell you about crop circles right now.

2486
01:44:29,300 --> 01:44:31,380
Those lousy renegades stole my pills.

2487
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:34,220
Without my ag relieve, I'll start fighting nurses.

2488
01:44:34,220 --> 01:44:36,020
You don't need the lawsuit!

2489
01:44:36,460 --> 01:44:37,240
You don't...

2490
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:37,800
Darn...

2491
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:38,600
Rickest...

2492
01:44:38,900 --> 01:44:40,540
Crap circles and...

2493
01:44:40,540 --> 01:44:40,920
Bang...

2494
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:41,580
Agrilee...

2495
01:44:42,220 --> 01:44:43,020
Oh dear.

2496
01:44:43,940 --> 01:44:44,580
Oh no.

2497
01:44:44,940 --> 01:44:45,760
He's going through it.

2498
01:44:45,860 --> 01:44:46,960
He doesn't have his meds.

2499
01:44:47,060 --> 01:44:49,420
From the bullies before time runs out.

2500
01:44:50,340 --> 01:44:51,740
That's like a problem I heard.

2501
01:44:52,280 --> 01:44:53,020
That like...

2502
01:44:53,020 --> 01:44:53,980
Like...

2503
01:44:53,980 --> 01:44:55,500
Nurses would steal...

2504
01:44:56,140 --> 01:44:56,600
The...

2505
01:44:57,080 --> 01:44:58,640
Like nurses and volunteers.

2506
01:44:58,900 --> 01:45:00,100
Where is the bullies?

2507
01:45:01,020 --> 01:45:01,440
Oh!

2508
01:45:01,540 --> 01:45:02,600
I have to go to the playground.

2509
01:45:02,740 --> 01:45:03,620
I was like, where are they?

2510
01:45:05,780 --> 01:45:07,600
I think they steal the medication.

2511
01:45:08,020 --> 01:45:09,660
And then they like sell it or something.

2512
01:45:09,860 --> 01:45:11,080
Or take it for recreational.

2513
01:45:16,180 --> 01:45:16,640
Woo!

2514
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:18,840
Yeah, I heard about that.

2515
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:20,380
From a TV show.

2516
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:21,940
Sorry!

2517
01:45:22,780 --> 01:45:23,820
I had...

2518
01:45:23,820 --> 01:45:24,300
I had...

2519
01:45:24,300 --> 01:45:26,820
I may or may not have heard about it from a TV show.

2520
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:32,240
Which is like practically accurate if you think about it.

2521
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:39,160
Alright.

2522
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:40,760
Gotta go to the playground.

2523
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:43,080
Gotta go to the school.

2524
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:45,560
Don't worry, I'm coming over!

2525
01:45:45,860 --> 01:45:47,400
Give me back my...

2526
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:48,000
My...

2527
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,440
Father-in-law's meds!

2528
01:45:53,620 --> 01:45:55,860
It's better than getting news from Twitter, guys.

2529
01:46:01,740 --> 01:46:02,220
Yeah!

2530
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:05,760
We traded it to some dudes in a black car for these play dudes.

2531
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:06,840
Check it out, man.

2532
01:46:07,060 --> 01:46:09,860
This one's got an interview with the guy who invented the wah-wah pillow.

2533
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:11,860
That's true though.

2534
01:46:12,420 --> 01:46:15,160
Playboy has actually really good interviews and stuff.

2535
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:17,760
Like they actually have...

2536
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:19,020
It's not just nudes.

2537
01:46:19,020 --> 01:46:20,000
It has articles.

2538
01:46:24,810 --> 01:46:27,370
They actually have like journalistic integrity.

2539
01:46:27,610 --> 01:46:28,290
Isn't that crazy?

2540
01:46:29,110 --> 01:46:30,510
Isn't that crazy?

2541
01:46:30,930 --> 01:46:34,390
Playboy has more journalistic integrity than other...

2542
01:46:34,390 --> 01:46:35,790
Journalism websites.

2543
01:46:37,190 --> 01:46:38,290
Okay, Father...

2544
01:46:38,290 --> 01:46:39,070
Okay, he's gonna have...

2545
01:46:39,070 --> 01:46:39,690
Drop random.

2546
01:46:41,150 --> 01:46:42,330
I don't know about now.

2547
01:46:42,370 --> 01:46:43,950
Ever since like Heath Ledger died.

2548
01:46:44,130 --> 01:46:44,870
Wait, not Heath Ledger.

2549
01:46:44,970 --> 01:46:45,590
That's the actor.

2550
01:46:46,190 --> 01:46:46,750
Oh...

2551
01:46:46,750 --> 01:46:47,470
Hugh Hefner!

2552
01:46:47,730 --> 01:46:48,630
Ever since...

2553
01:46:48,630 --> 01:46:49,750
I was like, wait, no.

2554
01:46:49,750 --> 01:46:50,770
Heath Ledger is the...

2555
01:46:50,770 --> 01:46:51,970
The Joker actor.

2556
01:46:52,170 --> 01:46:53,570
Ever since Hugh Hefner...

2557
01:46:53,570 --> 01:46:53,890
They...

2558
01:46:53,890 --> 01:46:54,450
They're...

2559
01:46:54,450 --> 01:46:56,110
They both start with age!

2560
01:46:56,790 --> 01:46:58,870
Ever since Hugh Hefner died.

2561
01:46:59,210 --> 01:47:01,330
I don't know if it's like still true though.

2562
01:47:01,330 --> 01:47:04,050
I don't keep...

2563
01:47:04,050 --> 01:47:05,670
They both start with age!

2564
01:47:05,810 --> 01:47:06,810
It's an honest mistake!

2565
01:47:12,870 --> 01:47:14,430
I'm trying to...

2566
01:47:14,430 --> 01:47:15,370
Guys, please!

2567
01:47:15,610 --> 01:47:16,630
I'm trying to get my...

2568
01:47:16,630 --> 01:47:18,770
My grandfather's meds!

2569
01:47:19,690 --> 01:47:20,410
Please!

2570
01:47:20,890 --> 01:47:22,190
It's all perfectly legal!

2571
01:47:22,190 --> 01:47:23,330
I'm trying to get my...

2572
01:47:23,330 --> 01:47:25,510
Oh no, where is it?

2573
01:47:25,870 --> 01:47:26,150
No!

2574
01:47:26,310 --> 01:47:28,530
I'm gonna get rested and fail this mission!

2575
01:47:30,630 --> 01:47:31,710
This is not fair.

2576
01:47:31,950 --> 01:47:32,910
This is not fair.

2577
01:47:33,030 --> 01:47:35,510
Why are you doing on my side of the road?!

2578
01:47:35,970 --> 01:47:37,130
This is actually not fair.

2579
01:47:37,450 --> 01:47:38,470
This is not fair.

2580
01:47:38,790 --> 01:47:39,910
This is not fair.

2581
01:47:40,710 --> 01:47:42,310
Where did he keep dropping meds?

2582
01:47:42,790 --> 01:47:43,350
Oh there it is.

2583
01:47:43,470 --> 01:47:43,890
There it is.

2584
01:47:44,390 --> 01:47:45,030
Here we go.

2585
01:47:45,370 --> 01:47:45,770
No!

2586
01:47:47,330 --> 01:47:47,730
What?!

2587
01:47:47,730 --> 01:47:50,870
And I have to go back!

2588
01:47:53,690 --> 01:47:55,270
Okay, guys, it's fine.

2589
01:47:55,350 --> 01:47:56,150
I didn't get arrested.

2590
01:47:56,570 --> 01:47:58,030
I didn't get arrested, guys.

2591
01:47:58,170 --> 01:47:59,750
I need to get this car out of my hands.

2592
01:47:59,850 --> 01:48:01,150
This car is too fucking wide.

2593
01:48:02,570 --> 01:48:04,810
Guys, I'm gonna fail this mission so I can leave.

2594
01:48:05,530 --> 01:48:07,850
So I can, like, grab an actual car.

2595
01:48:08,910 --> 01:48:09,190
Okay.

2596
01:48:10,610 --> 01:48:13,530
Uh... We'll grab... We'll have my daughter drive me.

2597
01:48:15,890 --> 01:48:16,770
Oh, that...

2598
01:48:18,230 --> 01:48:19,210
It's okay, guys.

2599
01:48:19,350 --> 01:48:20,770
I have to get another car.

2600
01:48:21,030 --> 01:48:22,450
I need my daughter to drive me.

2601
01:48:24,090 --> 01:48:25,270
Alright, here we go.

2602
01:48:25,770 --> 01:48:26,090
This is it.

2603
01:48:26,230 --> 01:48:28,270
This is it.

2604
01:48:29,570 --> 01:48:31,270
Alright, now it'll be fine.

2605
01:48:31,370 --> 01:48:31,990
Now it'll be fine.

2606
01:48:32,110 --> 01:48:35,110
Now I have a smaller car and also I'm faster.

2607
01:48:37,150 --> 01:48:38,870
This is all going according to plan.

2608
01:48:42,070 --> 01:48:44,870
And then we go this way and then that's... Oh my god.

2609
01:48:45,830 --> 01:48:48,810
Oh, that's funny that Lisa thinks she has college money.

2610
01:48:49,910 --> 01:48:50,650
There we go.

2611
01:48:52,310 --> 01:48:52,830
See?

2612
01:48:53,110 --> 01:48:53,490
It's fine.

2613
01:48:53,630 --> 01:48:54,410
Everything is fine.

2614
01:48:56,070 --> 01:48:57,250
Alright, Nelson.

2615
01:48:58,190 --> 01:49:00,650
Look, I have your boyfriend right here, Lisa.

2616
01:49:02,370 --> 01:49:02,810
Alright.

2617
01:49:04,690 --> 01:49:05,130
Alright.

2618
01:49:05,950 --> 01:49:06,810
Time to do this again.

2619
01:49:09,690 --> 01:49:13,150
Alright, and then I repaired the car and then...

2620
01:49:13,610 --> 01:49:17,170
Look, the reason why I failed that mission was because I was getting chased by cops.

2621
01:49:20,410 --> 01:49:20,890
Alright.

2622
01:49:21,250 --> 01:49:21,730
Alright.

2623
01:49:21,750 --> 01:49:22,430
That's fine.

2624
01:49:22,830 --> 01:49:22,890
See?

2625
01:49:23,030 --> 01:49:23,350
Look at that.

2626
01:49:23,490 --> 01:49:23,610
See?

2627
01:49:23,750 --> 01:49:24,730
The game is easier!

2628
01:49:25,090 --> 01:49:26,450
The game is easier now.

2629
01:49:26,590 --> 01:49:27,090
I told you.

2630
01:49:27,210 --> 01:49:27,670
When your...

2631
01:49:27,670 --> 01:49:30,990
When your 10 year old daughter drives you, it just gets surprising.

2632
01:49:31,270 --> 01:49:31,890
Oh no.

2633
01:49:32,330 --> 01:49:32,950
Oh no.

2634
01:49:33,310 --> 01:49:34,010
Oh no.

2635
01:49:34,210 --> 01:49:34,530
Please.

2636
01:49:34,750 --> 01:49:35,870
There's a garbage truck.

2637
01:49:36,090 --> 01:49:36,310
Please.

2638
01:49:36,310 --> 01:49:36,350
Please.

2639
01:49:36,350 --> 01:49:37,430
This is not fair.

2640
01:49:37,590 --> 01:49:38,470
This is not fair.

2641
01:49:38,590 --> 01:49:40,350
He's body blocking the man!

2642
01:49:43,530 --> 01:49:45,770
He's literally body blocking!

2643
01:49:46,750 --> 01:49:48,390
How is that my fault?

2644
01:49:49,510 --> 01:49:50,810
Are you fucking...

2645
01:49:50,810 --> 01:49:51,790
What is the hitbox?

2646
01:49:52,030 --> 01:49:53,870
What is the hitbox?

2647
01:49:55,750 --> 01:49:56,350
What...

2648
01:49:56,350 --> 01:49:57,850
Okay, this is not fair.

2649
01:50:00,310 --> 01:50:05,590
Sometimes the hitbox is like 80 meters tall, and sometimes it's like 0.1.

2650
01:50:06,790 --> 01:50:08,730
A bad anarchy.

2651
01:50:10,010 --> 01:50:10,530
RNG.

2652
01:50:11,330 --> 01:50:12,990
Alright, this is fine, this is fine.

2653
01:50:12,990 --> 01:50:13,790
I figured it out.

2654
01:50:14,850 --> 01:50:16,010
I figured it out.

2655
01:50:16,350 --> 01:50:18,490
I blame my 10-year-old daughter.

2656
01:50:18,950 --> 01:50:20,610
She could have drove me better.

2657
01:50:23,150 --> 01:50:23,670
Alright.

2658
01:50:25,070 --> 01:50:25,950
Alright, here we go.

2659
01:50:26,030 --> 01:50:26,670
I'm okay now.

2660
01:50:28,710 --> 01:50:30,050
Mate, thank you for the super chat.

2661
01:50:30,190 --> 01:50:30,950
Thank you, thank you.

2662
01:50:31,150 --> 01:50:34,770
Margie's car known on this game to be unstable as fuck, making all the emissions incredible.

2663
01:50:35,390 --> 01:50:36,550
See, I told you, it's the car.

2664
01:50:36,710 --> 01:50:37,630
It's the car, guys.

2665
01:50:38,170 --> 01:50:38,970
It's the car.

2666
01:50:38,970 --> 01:50:39,770
It's not me.

2667
01:50:40,450 --> 01:50:41,270
I knew it.

2668
01:50:41,390 --> 01:50:42,870
I knew I wasn't coping.

2669
01:50:43,070 --> 01:50:44,390
I knew it was always the car.

2670
01:50:45,790 --> 01:50:46,750
It's never me.

2671
01:50:47,170 --> 01:50:48,210
It's just the car.

2672
01:50:50,210 --> 01:50:50,610
Reasonable.

2673
01:50:52,150 --> 01:50:52,550
Alright.

2674
01:50:52,850 --> 01:50:53,510
See, look at that.

2675
01:50:53,990 --> 01:50:54,830
It's fine now.

2676
01:50:55,170 --> 01:50:56,130
I figured it out.

2677
01:50:59,730 --> 01:51:00,970
See, it's fine now.

2678
01:51:01,150 --> 01:51:03,070
I figured it out for real.

2679
01:51:03,490 --> 01:51:05,150
Wait, a U-turn?

2680
01:51:05,190 --> 01:51:06,310
It does that?

2681
01:51:08,650 --> 01:51:09,970
Wait, that's illegal.

2682
01:51:11,150 --> 01:51:13,070
You're supposed to drive one way.

2683
01:51:15,030 --> 01:51:16,390
Wait, where is the car?

2684
01:51:16,790 --> 01:51:17,690
Where is the car?

2685
01:51:19,070 --> 01:51:20,790
Why is it driving like that?

2686
01:51:21,470 --> 01:51:21,650
Why is it driving like that?

2687
01:51:23,410 --> 01:51:24,270
Oh, my God.

2688
01:51:24,450 --> 01:51:25,350
I am like...

2689
01:51:25,350 --> 01:51:26,430
I'm not going slow.

2690
01:51:26,610 --> 01:51:28,450
I'm just... I'm just really worried.

2691
01:51:28,450 --> 01:51:29,230
I'm just scared.

2692
01:51:33,230 --> 01:51:33,950
Oh, no.

2693
01:51:34,710 --> 01:51:36,930
I'm trying to make sure I grab everything.

2694
01:51:39,110 --> 01:51:39,930
Okay, it's fine.

2695
01:51:40,170 --> 01:51:40,870
It's fine.

2696
01:51:41,710 --> 01:51:42,790
Everything is fine.

2697
01:51:43,030 --> 01:51:45,530
As long as we pick up every item, it's okay.

2698
01:51:46,370 --> 01:51:47,210
Item dropped.

2699
01:51:48,170 --> 01:51:48,630
Okay.

2700
01:51:49,510 --> 01:51:49,990
Eight.

2701
01:51:50,810 --> 01:51:51,230
Nine.

2702
01:51:51,630 --> 01:51:52,350
Just one more.

2703
01:51:52,570 --> 01:51:53,950
Just drop one more, little guy.

2704
01:51:54,810 --> 01:51:55,570
Where is it?

2705
01:51:55,690 --> 01:51:56,630
Where's the last one?

2706
01:51:56,890 --> 01:51:57,550
Where is it?

2707
01:51:57,810 --> 01:51:58,450
Where is it?

2708
01:51:58,450 --> 01:52:00,830
Are you fucking... Are you fucking serious?

2709
01:52:01,050 --> 01:52:02,050
Why is it over there?

2710
01:52:02,330 --> 01:52:03,830
Why is it over there?

2711
01:52:05,710 --> 01:52:06,390
No.

2712
01:52:06,970 --> 01:52:07,030
No.

2713
01:52:07,030 --> 01:52:07,190
No.

2714
01:52:07,750 --> 01:52:08,910
Oh, my God.

2715
01:52:09,310 --> 01:52:09,990
What?

2716
01:52:10,290 --> 01:52:10,650
Okay.

2717
01:52:10,850 --> 01:52:12,630
That is not my fault.

2718
01:52:13,150 --> 01:52:15,230
Like, that's actually cheating.

2719
01:52:17,490 --> 01:52:20,050
Toki got... How did I get outplayed?

2720
01:52:20,090 --> 01:52:21,210
He's actually cheating!

2721
01:52:21,950 --> 01:52:23,510
He's... Oh, my God.

2722
01:52:24,550 --> 01:52:30,110
He dropped it at the edge of the... the fucking... the fucking, uh, like, ramp.

2723
01:52:32,430 --> 01:52:33,990
Police, did you get his number?

2724
01:52:34,210 --> 01:52:35,110
Are you serious?

2725
01:52:35,330 --> 01:52:36,010
Are you serious?

2726
01:52:36,050 --> 01:52:37,270
I just went through so much.

2727
01:52:37,490 --> 01:52:38,810
I went through so much.

2728
01:52:38,930 --> 01:52:40,010
I don't understand.

2729
01:52:40,270 --> 01:52:41,290
I don't understand.

2730
01:52:41,390 --> 01:52:42,690
Why are you like this?

2731
01:52:42,850 --> 01:52:43,310
I...

2732
01:52:47,450 --> 01:52:48,330
Okay, nice.

2733
01:52:48,670 --> 01:52:49,930
Where's the retirement home?

2734
01:52:50,030 --> 01:52:51,410
I don't know where I am anymore.

2735
01:52:51,890 --> 01:52:53,530
I am so lost.

2736
01:52:54,530 --> 01:52:55,550
Oh, there it is.

2737
01:52:56,010 --> 01:52:57,210
I figured it out.

2738
01:52:58,830 --> 01:52:59,310
Yippee!

2739
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:05,030
Hey, guys.

2740
01:53:05,190 --> 01:53:06,150
Thank you for the super chat.

2741
01:53:06,270 --> 01:53:06,530
Thank you.

2742
01:53:06,650 --> 01:53:07,090
Thank you.

2743
01:53:07,510 --> 01:53:09,110
Crazy medicine, Grandpa.

2744
01:53:09,550 --> 01:53:10,350
Hot diggity!

2745
01:53:10,670 --> 01:53:11,770
Sweet, sweet medication!

2746
01:53:12,190 --> 01:53:13,050
Gimme, gimme, gimme!

2747
01:53:14,750 --> 01:53:15,690
What the fuck?

2748
01:53:17,910 --> 01:53:18,670
Oh, no.

2749
01:53:18,810 --> 01:53:19,310
He's asleep.

2750
01:53:20,810 --> 01:53:21,510
Just hit him.

2751
01:53:23,490 --> 01:53:24,770
I can't just hit him.

2752
01:53:25,470 --> 01:53:27,370
That's the easiest way to wake him up.

2753
01:53:27,570 --> 01:53:28,010
Wake up.

2754
01:53:29,710 --> 01:53:30,850
Wake up, Grandpa.

2755
01:53:31,370 --> 01:53:32,250
Wake up.

2756
01:53:32,750 --> 01:53:33,590
Grandpa, please.

2757
01:53:33,790 --> 01:53:34,950
We need to find your son.

2758
01:53:34,950 --> 01:53:35,310
More speed!

2759
01:53:35,630 --> 01:53:36,130
More speed!

2760
01:53:36,890 --> 01:53:37,190
More speed!

2761
01:53:37,190 --> 01:53:38,870
Wait, this... That's... It's next door!

2762
01:53:40,530 --> 01:53:42,550
I don't need to drive my car for this!

2763
01:53:45,710 --> 01:53:46,370
What's this?

2764
01:53:46,690 --> 01:53:47,410
Is that milk?

2765
01:53:47,590 --> 01:53:48,570
Is that milkies?

2766
01:53:50,570 --> 01:53:51,450
What did I get?

2767
01:53:54,570 --> 01:53:56,410
Guys, I didn't drive him over.

2768
01:53:56,510 --> 01:53:57,550
I gave him a little tap.

2769
01:53:57,850 --> 01:53:58,870
It's called a love tap.

2770
01:53:59,050 --> 01:53:59,910
You ever heard of that?

2771
01:53:59,910 --> 01:54:01,550
Look, I'll do it again.

2772
01:54:01,990 --> 01:54:03,010
Wake up.

2773
01:54:03,670 --> 01:54:04,050
Oh, shit.

2774
01:54:06,830 --> 01:54:07,490
See?

2775
01:54:07,650 --> 01:54:08,070
He's awake!

2776
01:54:08,070 --> 01:54:08,630
He talked!

2777
01:54:12,330 --> 01:54:14,650
Trucker's Choice Stay Alert Capsule?

2778
01:54:15,110 --> 01:54:16,350
Oh, my God.

2779
01:54:16,570 --> 01:54:17,750
I drugged my father-in-law.

2780
01:54:24,170 --> 01:54:24,850
What?

2781
01:54:28,110 --> 01:54:28,530
What?

2782
01:54:35,970 --> 01:54:36,710
Ha, ha, ha!

2783
01:54:37,050 --> 01:54:37,070
Ha, ha, ha!

2784
01:54:37,070 --> 01:54:38,550
I drove in a water car.

2785
01:54:39,390 --> 01:54:40,390
Okay, okay.

2786
01:54:40,850 --> 01:54:45,550
It was so long ago that I'll have to describe it in sepia tone.

2787
01:54:46,910 --> 01:54:47,830
Oh, my God.

2788
01:54:48,110 --> 01:54:48,510
That's a lot.

2789
01:54:48,850 --> 01:54:50,350
It was sort of a cosmic kind of thing.

2790
01:54:50,530 --> 01:54:54,510
Shaped kind of like a planet with an old-fashioned radio antenna coming off it.

2791
01:54:54,650 --> 01:54:56,690
A planet with an antenna?

2792
01:54:56,770 --> 01:54:57,130
What?

2793
01:54:57,470 --> 01:54:58,330
Oh, it's a UFO!

2794
01:54:59,310 --> 01:55:00,790
Oh, it's Buzz Koya!

2795
01:55:01,450 --> 01:55:02,390
I didn't think it was at the Quickie Mark.

2796
01:55:02,970 --> 01:55:03,650
That's it.

2797
01:55:03,710 --> 01:55:05,510
It was on a bottle of pop.

2798
01:55:05,510 --> 01:55:08,210
Maybe that will jog Bart's memory.

2799
01:55:08,490 --> 01:55:09,170
Oh!

2800
01:55:09,410 --> 01:55:11,210
I just got a sugar rush him!

2801
01:55:12,550 --> 01:55:13,230
Yippee!

2802
01:55:15,130 --> 01:55:15,810
Alright.

2803
01:55:16,090 --> 01:55:18,350
This has to be the hardest level so far.

2804
01:55:18,530 --> 01:55:20,050
I've... I realized...

2805
01:55:20,050 --> 01:55:21,510
I've been, like...

2806
01:55:21,510 --> 01:55:25,050
I've been, like, stuck on Marge's level for an...

2807
01:55:25,050 --> 01:55:28,050
for an abnormally long time.

2808
01:55:28,630 --> 01:55:29,310
Abnormal...

2809
01:55:30,010 --> 01:55:30,690
Abnormally.

2810
01:55:31,150 --> 01:55:31,830
Abnormally?

2811
01:55:32,230 --> 01:55:33,450
Ab-anomally?

2812
01:55:33,730 --> 01:55:34,310
Ab-

2813
01:55:40,130 --> 01:55:40,530
Abnormally.

2814
01:55:40,930 --> 01:55:41,330
Abnormally?

2815
01:55:41,570 --> 01:55:41,970
Abnormally?

2816
01:55:41,970 --> 01:55:42,670
Abnormally long amount of time.

2817
01:55:42,790 --> 01:55:43,050
There we go.

2818
01:55:43,150 --> 01:55:43,530
I got it.

2819
01:55:43,890 --> 01:55:44,570
Guys, I...

2820
01:55:44,570 --> 01:55:45,790
Heart attack over.

2821
01:55:46,230 --> 01:55:46,630
Heart...

2822
01:55:48,850 --> 01:55:49,250
Heart...

2823
01:55:49,250 --> 01:55:50,170
Heart attack's over, guys.

2824
01:55:50,310 --> 01:55:50,850
I'm okay now.

2825
01:55:54,830 --> 01:55:56,650
Oh, I have to go visit Bart.

2826
01:55:56,910 --> 01:55:57,270
Okay.

2827
01:56:01,510 --> 01:56:04,350
Oh yeah, this couch is actually... okay, so they retconned it.

2828
01:56:04,710 --> 01:56:08,750
Actually not retconned, but they didn't throw it back, but this couch was actually owned by Ned Flanders.

2829
01:56:09,850 --> 01:56:11,230
Yeah, it's the wrong room.

2830
01:56:11,350 --> 01:56:12,910
That's why I had to go to Bart's room earlier.

2831
01:56:13,190 --> 01:56:14,850
Oh my gosh, now everything makes sense.

2832
01:56:15,290 --> 01:56:16,050
Can I shortcut this?

2833
01:56:16,290 --> 01:56:17,090
I can, nice.

2834
01:56:20,550 --> 01:56:20,950
Alright.

2835
01:56:22,090 --> 01:56:23,070
Okay, parkour.

2836
01:56:24,370 --> 01:56:25,070
Nice, alright.

2837
01:56:27,450 --> 01:56:27,850
Alright.

2838
01:56:27,850 --> 01:56:28,190
Hello, Bart.

2839
01:56:29,030 --> 01:56:30,550
Wait, I want to change to my cop.

2840
01:56:30,910 --> 01:56:31,570
Cop uniform.

2841
01:56:35,030 --> 01:56:35,430
Alright.

2842
01:56:35,430 --> 01:56:35,830
Alright.

2843
01:56:37,230 --> 01:56:39,390
Alright, I'm gonna scare him straight.

2844
01:56:40,170 --> 01:56:53,710
You know, like this, that, you know, okay, back then when we like didn't care about giving children PTSD, we had shows where like, um, cops cut, like we bring criminals in and then like, like scare the shit out of the children and be like, if you do this,

2845
01:56:53,810 --> 01:56:54,970
this is what just gonna happen.

2846
01:56:55,370 --> 01:56:57,470
I'm gonna, I'm gonna fuck you up in jail.

2847
01:56:57,930 --> 01:56:57,930
What?

2848
01:56:58,050 --> 01:57:00,090
Do you know what I can use this design?

2849
01:57:01,710 --> 01:57:03,230
That's the alien mind control cola.

2850
01:57:03,490 --> 01:57:05,190
They gave us time to get up in the alien spaceship.

2851
01:57:05,430 --> 01:57:07,390
They're using it to make the town go crazy.

2852
01:57:07,690 --> 01:57:08,750
Oh, thank God.

2853
01:57:08,850 --> 01:57:09,590
We did it.

2854
01:57:09,730 --> 01:57:10,690
Out of your trance.

2855
01:57:10,830 --> 01:57:12,070
I was so worried.

2856
01:57:12,270 --> 01:57:13,410
Later, I'm going to the arcade.

2857
01:57:13,670 --> 01:57:13,850
Oh.

2858
01:57:14,770 --> 01:57:15,570
He's okay now.

2859
01:57:23,370 --> 01:57:23,890
Nice.

2860
01:57:24,110 --> 01:57:24,910
Oh, I did it!

2861
01:57:26,010 --> 01:57:27,970
I am Officer Marge!

2862
01:57:28,810 --> 01:57:31,930
We're gonna collect all the evil cola cans before time runs out.

2863
01:57:32,110 --> 01:57:32,690
I'll do my best.

2864
01:57:33,570 --> 01:57:35,670
Alright, time to collect...

2865
01:57:35,670 --> 01:57:36,150
Fart, please.

2866
01:57:37,090 --> 01:57:37,970
Fart, please.

2867
01:57:38,310 --> 01:57:39,070
Fart, please!

2868
01:57:39,310 --> 01:57:40,850
Don't make mommy angry.

2869
01:57:44,470 --> 01:57:47,270
Alright, we gotta collect all the cans.

2870
01:57:48,710 --> 01:57:50,430
Wait, there's like... money though.

2871
01:57:51,010 --> 01:57:52,370
Wait, this is important.

2872
01:57:53,750 --> 01:57:54,250
Go where?

2873
01:57:54,810 --> 01:57:57,190
I might fail that mission, but this is important.

2874
01:57:58,010 --> 01:57:58,590
Bum bum.

2875
01:57:59,510 --> 01:58:00,450
Bum bum.

2876
01:58:01,130 --> 01:58:01,910
Look, Fart.

2877
01:58:02,610 --> 01:58:04,930
We are somehow paid for your...

2878
01:58:04,930 --> 01:58:06,190
college education.

2879
01:58:06,890 --> 01:58:07,710
As if.

2880
01:58:10,370 --> 01:58:10,850
Fart.

2881
01:58:10,850 --> 01:58:11,190
Fart.

2882
01:58:11,650 --> 01:58:12,130
Fart.

2883
01:58:13,650 --> 01:58:14,130
Fart.

2884
01:58:14,590 --> 01:58:14,690
Fart.

2885
01:58:14,990 --> 01:58:15,210
Fart.

2886
01:58:15,250 --> 01:58:15,510
Fart.

2887
01:58:15,830 --> 01:58:16,310
Fart.

2888
01:58:17,370 --> 01:58:22,130
Alright, I might have to like redo this mission, because I definitely did not come...

2889
01:58:22,870 --> 01:58:23,910
Wait, where is it?

2890
01:58:24,550 --> 01:58:25,150
How do I...

2891
01:58:25,150 --> 01:58:25,910
Oh, there you go.

2892
01:58:27,070 --> 01:58:28,810
Yeah, there's no way I'm completing this...

2893
01:58:29,230 --> 01:58:29,650
Fart.

2894
01:58:30,850 --> 01:58:31,330
Fart.

2895
01:58:31,330 --> 01:58:33,110
I need a long island iced tea.

2896
01:58:33,370 --> 01:58:33,850
Fart.

2897
01:58:33,870 --> 01:58:34,150
Fart.

2898
01:58:34,150 --> 01:58:34,390
Not wrong.

2899
01:58:36,270 --> 01:58:38,690
No, not 30 of them.

2900
01:58:38,930 --> 01:58:40,170
Now it's parkour!

2901
01:58:42,370 --> 01:58:43,350
Press the button.

2902
01:58:43,490 --> 01:58:43,930
Press the button.

2903
01:58:45,610 --> 01:58:46,590
Bum bum.

2904
01:58:47,710 --> 01:58:48,690
Bum bum.

2905
01:58:50,770 --> 01:58:51,290
Bum bum.

2906
01:58:51,290 --> 01:58:52,430
Guys, you think I'm gonna make it?

2907
01:58:54,170 --> 01:58:55,090
That's like...

2908
01:58:55,090 --> 01:58:56,410
I missed that jump.

2909
01:58:56,630 --> 01:58:58,330
Guys, I'm definitely gonna make it, guys.

2910
01:58:58,330 --> 01:58:59,130
Yes!

2911
01:59:02,430 --> 01:59:04,910
Okay, now I believe myself less.

2912
01:59:06,010 --> 01:59:06,530
Now...

2913
01:59:07,310 --> 01:59:08,670
Okay, now I don't know.

2914
01:59:09,450 --> 01:59:11,670
Now I might not make it.

2915
01:59:13,550 --> 01:59:15,770
Look, we were going to make it, okay?

2916
01:59:16,090 --> 01:59:16,690
I just...

2917
01:59:16,690 --> 01:59:17,210
I made a...

2918
01:59:17,210 --> 01:59:17,730
I messed up.

2919
01:59:17,830 --> 01:59:18,430
I might have messed up.

2920
01:59:18,550 --> 01:59:19,730
I might...

2921
01:59:20,330 --> 01:59:21,010
Bum bum.

2922
01:59:23,770 --> 01:59:24,810
And then...

2923
01:59:26,130 --> 01:59:27,810
Oh my god, please.

2924
01:59:28,530 --> 01:59:32,810
Oh my god,

2925
01:59:36,850 --> 01:59:36,850
please.

2926
01:59:36,850 --> 01:59:38,270
How do I get there?

2927
01:59:39,890 --> 01:59:41,650
I don't understand!

2928
01:59:43,670 --> 01:59:44,550
It's Bart's fault.

2929
01:59:45,070 --> 01:59:45,610
Why...

2930
01:59:45,610 --> 01:59:47,270
Why did you have to...

2931
01:59:47,270 --> 01:59:48,550
Get abducted!

2932
01:59:49,590 --> 01:59:50,890
It's Bart's fault.

2933
01:59:51,130 --> 01:59:52,210
I'm victim blaming.

2934
01:59:55,580 --> 01:59:57,470
Can you pick it up a little bit?

2935
01:59:59,110 --> 02:00:01,490
Oh my god, I'm so close!

2936
02:00:01,650 --> 02:00:03,810
Even after all the times I messed up!

2937
02:00:04,010 --> 02:00:05,190
I can't believe it!

2938
02:00:11,390 --> 02:00:12,630
I actually...

2939
02:00:12,630 --> 02:00:15,590
I could've got it even after all the times I messed up!

2940
02:00:15,870 --> 02:00:18,050
I was one cat away!

2941
02:00:19,570 --> 02:00:21,170
I can't believe it.

2942
02:00:21,230 --> 02:00:22,690
It was actually one cat.

2943
02:00:22,830 --> 02:00:25,310
If I didn't get distracted by money!

2944
02:00:27,390 --> 02:00:28,910
It's all Bart's fault.

2945
02:00:29,230 --> 02:00:30,430
That's Seki, right?

2946
02:00:32,210 --> 02:00:32,910
I'm an adult!

2947
02:00:33,030 --> 02:00:33,930
I can blame children!

2948
02:00:35,470 --> 02:00:36,750
So close!

2949
02:00:37,730 --> 02:00:38,310
I...

2950
02:00:43,190 --> 02:00:45,110
The root of all evil.

2951
02:00:46,550 --> 02:00:48,430
It's Chow's fault, not me.

2952
02:00:49,030 --> 02:00:50,010
Oh my god.

2953
02:00:51,230 --> 02:00:53,230
I'm legally allowed to blame children.

2954
02:00:53,370 --> 02:00:54,270
I'm an adult.

2955
02:00:56,470 --> 02:00:56,790
Alright.

2956
02:00:57,390 --> 02:00:58,830
Ba-dum.

2957
02:00:59,790 --> 02:01:01,070
Ba-dum.

2958
02:01:01,530 --> 02:01:03,010
Ba-dum.

2959
02:01:03,450 --> 02:01:05,010
Ba-dum.

2960
02:01:05,310 --> 02:01:06,690
Ba-dum.

2961
02:01:06,890 --> 02:01:07,450
Ba-dum.

2962
02:01:07,450 --> 02:01:07,590
Ba-dum.

2963
02:01:07,590 --> 02:01:09,430
This is like actual brain rot music right now.

2964
02:01:09,850 --> 02:01:10,490
Ba-dum.

2965
02:01:11,550 --> 02:01:12,490
Ba-dum.

2966
02:01:13,570 --> 02:01:14,050
Ba-dum.

2967
02:01:14,050 --> 02:01:14,630
Ba-dum.

2968
02:01:14,890 --> 02:01:15,670
Ba-dum.

2969
02:01:15,850 --> 02:01:16,990
Ba-dum.

2970
02:01:16,990 --> 02:01:17,770
Please!

2971
02:01:18,410 --> 02:01:19,770
Where is your shadow?

2972
02:01:20,230 --> 02:01:21,550
How am I supposed to know?

2973
02:01:21,550 --> 02:01:22,450
Where is my cat?

2974
02:01:22,610 --> 02:01:23,270
I can't see the shadow!

2975
02:01:24,310 --> 02:01:24,790
Okay.

2976
02:01:25,190 --> 02:01:26,330
It's not my fault.

2977
02:01:26,590 --> 02:01:28,330
It's poor game design right here for this.

2978
02:01:28,430 --> 02:01:28,990
There's no shadow.

2979
02:01:29,110 --> 02:01:30,090
How was I supposed to know?

2980
02:01:33,590 --> 02:01:38,690
How was I supposed to know the depth perception if I don't have a shadow to tell me where it is?

2981
02:01:39,590 --> 02:01:40,670
Alright, this way.

2982
02:01:42,530 --> 02:01:44,150
And then...

2983
02:01:44,150 --> 02:01:45,330
Oh wait, there is a shadow.

2984
02:01:45,410 --> 02:01:47,510
Why is the shadow there, but not on the roof?

2985
02:01:48,170 --> 02:01:49,250
See the shadow here!

2986
02:01:53,070 --> 02:01:54,150
Nice, we did it.

2987
02:01:57,390 --> 02:01:58,130
Where's Apu?

2988
02:01:58,210 --> 02:01:59,830
Oh wait, the cooking mart is next door.

2989
02:02:01,070 --> 02:02:01,950
Alright, here we go.

2990
02:02:02,150 --> 02:02:05,190
Wait, I just... I literally just shimmied across.

2991
02:02:08,090 --> 02:02:09,110
Alright, Apu.

2992
02:02:09,250 --> 02:02:10,190
What happened here?

2993
02:02:10,410 --> 02:02:12,110
Who's selling these Buzz Colas?

2994
02:02:14,150 --> 02:02:16,430
I swear that you're selling a tainted cola.

2995
02:02:16,890 --> 02:02:18,310
Where's this stuff coming from?

2996
02:02:18,570 --> 02:02:20,830
There is little here not tainted in some way.

2997
02:02:21,270 --> 02:02:23,250
Even the astrology scrolls give poor advice.

2998
02:02:23,830 --> 02:02:25,650
But, I will get to the bottom of this.

2999
02:02:25,870 --> 02:02:28,470
Yeah, isn't like his hot dogs made of like...

3000
02:02:28,470 --> 02:02:29,950
Made of roll kill?

3001
02:02:30,130 --> 02:02:31,570
And if I find the destroyer, I'm gonna give them a piece of my mind.

3002
02:02:31,830 --> 02:02:33,030
Careful, Mrs. Simpson.

3003
02:02:33,250 --> 02:02:36,370
This cola makes people do irrational things without guilt.

3004
02:02:36,370 --> 02:02:40,490
It is as though they have bottled the effects of a raging frat gegger.

3005
02:02:44,830 --> 02:02:45,570
That's right.

3006
02:02:46,690 --> 02:02:47,270
That's right.

3007
02:02:47,370 --> 02:02:49,110
You don't want to piss off a Karen.

3008
02:02:51,430 --> 02:02:52,270
They've done it.

3009
02:02:52,410 --> 02:02:53,510
They pissed her off.

3010
02:02:55,190 --> 02:02:57,290
The scariest thing you can ever do.

3011
02:02:57,930 --> 02:02:59,290
Okay, we gotta call my...

3012
02:02:59,830 --> 02:03:01,390
We gotta call my daughter.

3013
02:03:01,810 --> 02:03:02,530
Drive me again.

3014
02:03:03,310 --> 02:03:03,610
Alright.

3015
02:03:04,090 --> 02:03:04,730
Alright, Lisa.

3016
02:03:06,230 --> 02:03:06,990
Oh shit.

3017
02:03:08,310 --> 02:03:08,750
Um...

3018
02:03:08,750 --> 02:03:09,710
Alright, maybe not.

3019
02:03:11,110 --> 02:03:11,550
Maybe...

3020
02:03:11,550 --> 02:03:12,910
Maybe not that car.

3021
02:03:13,250 --> 02:03:13,690
Uh...

3022
02:03:13,690 --> 02:03:14,590
Let's just drive the...

3023
02:03:14,590 --> 02:03:15,550
Let's get the Kremlin.

3024
02:03:15,750 --> 02:03:16,730
Alright, there we go.

3025
02:03:17,290 --> 02:03:18,250
Yeah, I might not.

3026
02:03:18,530 --> 02:03:19,510
Oh wait, I need a tougher car.

3027
02:03:19,530 --> 02:03:20,710
I'm supposed to ram things.

3028
02:03:20,930 --> 02:03:21,110
Okay.

3029
02:03:21,350 --> 02:03:21,890
You're right.

3030
02:03:21,890 --> 02:03:22,310
I forgot.

3031
02:03:22,430 --> 02:03:23,250
It's Mr. Plow tab.

3032
02:03:23,250 --> 02:03:24,410
Can you give me a lift?

3033
02:03:24,550 --> 02:03:25,250
There you go.

3034
02:03:27,110 --> 02:03:28,570
Alright, Officer Marge.

3035
02:03:28,750 --> 02:03:30,110
About to commit legal crime.

3036
02:03:32,050 --> 02:03:32,770
There we go.

3037
02:03:33,870 --> 02:03:34,290
Don't worry.

3038
02:03:34,390 --> 02:03:35,410
I got Mr. Plow.

3039
02:03:36,010 --> 02:03:36,710
Oh no.

3040
02:03:37,450 --> 02:03:38,630
I swear to God.

3041
02:03:38,850 --> 02:03:40,350
If I have to do...

3042
02:03:40,350 --> 02:03:40,930
If I...

3043
02:03:40,930 --> 02:03:42,890
Guys, if I fail this mission...

3044
02:03:42,890 --> 02:03:45,110
Do I have to do a certain mission again?

3045
02:03:48,110 --> 02:03:48,550
Guys.

3046
02:03:49,090 --> 02:03:50,830
Please don't tell me I have to do this again.

3047
02:03:50,910 --> 02:03:52,150
I have to collect cola again.

3048
02:03:54,790 --> 02:03:55,750
Oh no.

3049
02:03:56,370 --> 02:03:56,890
Oh no.

3050
02:03:57,130 --> 02:03:57,290
Oh no.

3051
02:03:57,290 --> 02:03:58,090
Not this one.

3052
02:03:59,190 --> 02:04:00,530
Okay, it's a new mission.

3053
02:04:00,650 --> 02:04:00,970
Thank God.

3054
02:04:02,190 --> 02:04:02,690
Okay.

3055
02:04:03,110 --> 02:04:04,410
Oh, I should've got the bus.

3056
02:04:04,650 --> 02:04:05,990
I should've got the bus.

3057
02:04:06,110 --> 02:04:07,250
I forgot how fuck these...

3058
02:04:07,810 --> 02:04:08,270
Oh!

3059
02:04:09,190 --> 02:04:10,510
Get over here!

3060
02:04:10,790 --> 02:04:12,470
I'm an angry housewife!

3061
02:04:13,010 --> 02:04:13,650
Finish.

3062
02:04:13,770 --> 02:04:14,910
Finish fast.

3063
02:04:17,410 --> 02:04:21,630
There's nothing more dangerous than pissing off a bored housewife.

3064
02:04:22,210 --> 02:04:26,050
I have nothing else in my life cause I quit my career for my husband.

3065
02:04:26,310 --> 02:04:27,190
No time for cars.

3066
02:04:27,190 --> 02:04:28,150
That's all I have.

3067
02:04:32,070 --> 02:04:33,290
That's fucking right.

3068
02:04:33,550 --> 02:04:34,330
I'm a trip.

3069
02:04:36,310 --> 02:04:38,330
There's nothing else I have in my life.

3070
02:04:38,610 --> 02:04:40,810
I used to have a successful career.

3071
02:04:42,010 --> 02:04:43,350
Not very good at this.

3072
02:04:43,350 --> 02:04:44,390
And now...

3073
02:04:44,390 --> 02:04:46,590
I'm trying to raise three kids!

3074
02:04:47,030 --> 02:04:49,510
On a paycheck that my husband...

3075
02:04:49,510 --> 02:04:51,030
That can barely support them!

3076
02:04:54,710 --> 02:04:55,190
Alright.

3077
02:05:00,450 --> 02:05:00,930
Nice.

3078
02:05:01,130 --> 02:05:01,470
We did it.

3079
02:05:01,930 --> 02:05:02,610
I told you.

3080
02:05:02,770 --> 02:05:04,030
Never piss off a housewife.

3081
02:05:06,250 --> 02:05:07,710
She has nothing to lose!

3082
02:05:07,890 --> 02:05:09,810
She already quit her entire life for him!

3083
02:05:11,250 --> 02:05:11,950
Too real.

3084
02:05:13,390 --> 02:05:14,150
Alright, nice.

3085
02:05:14,190 --> 02:05:14,670
We did it.

3086
02:05:16,030 --> 02:05:17,250
Alright, that was easy.

3087
02:05:17,570 --> 02:05:18,050
Thank God.

3088
02:05:19,770 --> 02:05:22,210
It's a miracle we still have a home!

3089
02:05:24,650 --> 02:05:26,350
I destroyed another one!

3090
02:05:26,670 --> 02:05:27,110
What do you mean?

3091
02:05:27,230 --> 02:05:28,390
My job's not over!

3092
02:05:30,230 --> 02:05:31,750
My job's not over?

3093
02:05:32,270 --> 02:05:33,110
There's no way.

3094
02:05:34,070 --> 02:05:34,730
Wait, what?

3095
02:05:34,910 --> 02:05:36,050
It just drove past me.

3096
02:05:36,510 --> 02:05:37,410
It can do that?

3097
02:05:37,750 --> 02:05:41,770
It just drove past me just like that.

3098
02:05:43,650 --> 02:05:44,050
What?

3099
02:05:44,050 --> 02:05:44,470
Oh, no.

3100
02:05:45,910 --> 02:05:47,490
Wait, how many do I have to destroy?

3101
02:05:47,610 --> 02:05:48,990
There's more than one?!

3102
02:05:50,350 --> 02:05:52,930
Okay, that should destroy the truck a little bit, you know?

3103
02:05:55,170 --> 02:05:55,570
Okay.

3104
02:05:56,470 --> 02:05:57,090
Here we go.

3105
02:06:02,130 --> 02:06:03,070
Alright, and then...

3106
02:06:03,070 --> 02:06:03,630
Oh, wait!

3107
02:06:03,790 --> 02:06:04,290
I got an idea!

3108
02:06:04,970 --> 02:06:06,050
I just push it back.

3109
02:06:08,830 --> 02:06:09,670
Push you back.

3110
02:06:09,930 --> 02:06:11,310
And then I do this.

3111
02:06:11,750 --> 02:06:13,050
And then I...

3112
02:06:13,050 --> 02:06:15,370
Okay, I'm like actually losing time doing that.

3113
02:06:15,690 --> 02:06:16,090
I...

3114
02:06:19,950 --> 02:06:21,510
Oh my God, I should've got the school bus.

3115
02:06:21,790 --> 02:06:23,290
I should've got the school bus.

3116
02:06:23,670 --> 02:06:26,210
Oh my God, why did I get the school bus, guys?

3117
02:06:27,610 --> 02:06:28,990
Oh, this is a lot harder.

3118
02:06:29,350 --> 02:06:30,510
This is a lot harder.

3119
02:06:31,010 --> 02:06:33,190
Being in a corridor is a lot harder, guys.

3120
02:06:33,730 --> 02:06:34,130
Wait.

3121
02:06:36,070 --> 02:06:37,390
Oh my God, I can't...

3122
02:06:37,390 --> 02:06:38,630
Oh my God, this is it.

3123
02:06:39,210 --> 02:06:39,830
This is the plan.

3124
02:06:40,590 --> 02:06:41,590
Put him in the corner!

3125
02:06:43,230 --> 02:06:44,350
Put him in the corner!

3126
02:06:44,490 --> 02:06:45,130
He doesn't know what to do!

3127
02:06:45,290 --> 02:06:46,250
He's hitting himself!

3128
02:06:46,870 --> 02:06:48,050
He's hitting himself!

3129
02:06:49,790 --> 02:06:50,670
This is it!

3130
02:06:53,990 --> 02:06:55,210
He doesn't know!

3131
02:06:59,530 --> 02:07:00,050
Alright.

3132
02:07:01,070 --> 02:07:02,030
A few more hits.

3133
02:07:03,110 --> 02:07:04,910
Oh my God, he's so confused.

3134
02:07:06,490 --> 02:07:07,930
He's actually hitting himself!

3135
02:07:08,390 --> 02:07:09,570
Why are you hitting yourself?

3136
02:07:09,570 --> 02:07:09,730
Oh no!

3137
02:07:11,310 --> 02:07:11,710
Yeah!

3138
02:07:12,310 --> 02:07:12,850
Okay, nice.

3139
02:07:13,010 --> 02:07:13,670
Alright, we did it.

3140
02:07:14,630 --> 02:07:15,730
Beat him up in the corner.

3141
02:07:15,930 --> 02:07:16,610
I need a wrench.

3142
02:07:16,850 --> 02:07:17,550
I need a wrench.

3143
02:07:17,810 --> 02:07:19,350
Somebody, please give me a wrench.

3144
02:07:20,130 --> 02:07:20,750
Alright, wait.

3145
02:07:21,290 --> 02:07:23,350
Power walking is good for my god, it's Jesus Christ.

3146
02:07:23,350 --> 02:07:24,310
Oh my God, thank God.

3147
02:07:24,330 --> 02:07:24,790
I can't...

3148
02:07:24,790 --> 02:07:25,750
I can't get another car.

3149
02:07:26,190 --> 02:07:27,510
I can't...

3150
02:07:27,510 --> 02:07:27,930
Reload.

3151
02:07:29,090 --> 02:07:29,550
Alright, nice.

3152
02:07:31,110 --> 02:07:31,510
Reload.

3153
02:07:33,110 --> 02:07:33,730
Next car.

3154
02:07:36,270 --> 02:07:37,050
I got...

3155
02:07:37,050 --> 02:07:37,430
Where am I?

3156
02:07:38,350 --> 02:07:39,310
Where am I?

3157
02:07:39,670 --> 02:07:40,810
Where am I?

3158
02:07:41,270 --> 02:07:42,030
Alright, nice.

3159
02:07:42,210 --> 02:07:42,350
Okay.

3160
02:07:42,930 --> 02:07:44,670
Sorry, I was in the sky for a little bit.

3161
02:07:44,790 --> 02:07:45,650
I got a little confused.

3162
02:07:46,790 --> 02:07:47,470
Oh no.

3163
02:07:47,970 --> 02:07:49,450
Oh no, this car is too wide.

3164
02:07:49,450 --> 02:07:51,630
This car is too wide!

3165
02:07:52,010 --> 02:07:52,530
No!

3166
02:07:53,550 --> 02:07:53,910
No!

3167
02:07:55,170 --> 02:07:56,110
Where am I?

3168
02:07:56,810 --> 02:07:58,670
Nice girls, finish fast.

3169
02:07:58,710 --> 02:07:58,990
Okay.

3170
02:07:59,550 --> 02:08:00,790
It's okay, I figured it out.

3171
02:08:03,430 --> 02:08:06,010
He's gotta ram your car a little bit back and forth.

3172
02:08:07,350 --> 02:08:08,470
I got spirit.

3173
02:08:09,430 --> 02:08:10,990
I got spirit, guys.

3174
02:08:14,130 --> 02:08:15,090
Okay, am I not?

3175
02:08:15,230 --> 02:08:16,510
Oh my God, I see it.

3176
02:08:16,710 --> 02:08:17,650
I see it.

3177
02:08:17,650 --> 02:08:19,570
I see the last truck.

3178
02:08:19,810 --> 02:08:19,950
I...

3179
02:08:19,950 --> 02:08:22,730
I'm gonna destroy three?!

3180
02:08:23,390 --> 02:08:24,830
Oh, guys, I think...

3181
02:08:25,590 --> 02:08:28,810
Oh, thank God.

3182
02:08:30,410 --> 02:08:33,010
Guys, there is a chance that I have...

3183
02:08:33,590 --> 02:08:35,090
I'll have to do this again.

3184
02:08:35,090 --> 02:08:36,470
I don't believe...

3185
02:08:36,470 --> 02:08:38,210
You know, me getting this...

3186
02:08:38,210 --> 02:08:41,210
Me getting two was already, like, a miracle.

3187
02:08:41,790 --> 02:08:42,510
I...

3188
02:08:42,510 --> 02:08:43,330
No!

3189
02:08:44,350 --> 02:08:46,230
I should've got the bus!

3190
02:08:47,650 --> 02:08:49,910
Why did I get the bus?!

3191
02:08:54,170 --> 02:08:54,550
No!

3192
02:08:55,470 --> 02:08:55,870
Why?

3193
02:08:56,550 --> 02:08:57,590
I didn't realize!

3194
02:08:58,850 --> 02:08:59,910
Oh, no.

3195
02:09:00,150 --> 02:09:00,930
Guys, it's over.

3196
02:09:01,130 --> 02:09:02,350
I stopped believing.

3197
02:09:03,430 --> 02:09:05,490
There's no corners for me.

3198
02:09:06,330 --> 02:09:08,690
There's no corners for this!

3199
02:09:12,170 --> 02:09:12,550
No!

3200
02:09:12,550 --> 02:09:12,750
No!

3201
02:09:13,930 --> 02:09:16,230
I got map environment!

3202
02:09:17,910 --> 02:09:18,830
Oh, no.

3203
02:09:19,410 --> 02:09:19,710
No!

3204
02:09:20,310 --> 02:09:21,690
Stupid garbage truck!

3205
02:09:23,070 --> 02:09:24,230
It's already over.

3206
02:09:24,930 --> 02:09:26,230
It's already over.

3207
02:09:26,430 --> 02:09:27,730
And then I'm gonna get arrested.

3208
02:09:27,990 --> 02:09:29,590
And then I'm gonna get arrested?!

3209
02:09:30,430 --> 02:09:31,750
Oh my God, the cops will help me!

3210
02:09:31,950 --> 02:09:32,770
The cops...

3211
02:09:32,770 --> 02:09:34,650
I should pay more attention.

3212
02:09:35,950 --> 02:09:38,050
You're supposed to help me!

3213
02:09:38,370 --> 02:09:39,870
I'm part of your team!

3214
02:09:42,430 --> 02:09:44,690
I thought he was gonna help me.

3215
02:09:45,110 --> 02:09:47,910
I thought we were in this to get there.

3216
02:09:48,350 --> 02:09:51,170
We're nearly part of the same team!

3217
02:09:53,090 --> 02:09:53,770
No!

3218
02:09:54,170 --> 02:09:54,850
No!

3219
02:09:56,050 --> 02:09:56,730
No!

3220
02:09:57,050 --> 02:09:57,210
No!

3221
02:09:57,210 --> 02:09:57,810
Are you blind?

3222
02:09:58,090 --> 02:09:58,690
No!

3223
02:09:59,170 --> 02:09:59,810
Where is he?

3224
02:10:00,170 --> 02:10:00,590
No!

3225
02:10:04,370 --> 02:10:05,050
No!

3226
02:10:07,010 --> 02:10:07,690
No!

3227
02:10:07,690 --> 02:10:08,350
Oh my God!

3228
02:10:09,130 --> 02:10:11,330
No, I'm hitting every car except...

3229
02:10:11,330 --> 02:10:12,270
I forgot to hit himself!

3230
02:10:12,550 --> 02:10:14,530
Hit himself, but it does it better!

3231
02:10:15,050 --> 02:10:15,730
No!

3232
02:10:20,210 --> 02:10:20,890
No!

3233
02:10:21,910 --> 02:10:21,950
No!

3234
02:10:21,950 --> 02:10:21,990
No!

3235
02:10:21,990 --> 02:10:22,210
No!

3236
02:10:22,210 --> 02:10:24,190
Everyone better stay on my way!

3237
02:10:24,670 --> 02:10:25,350
Alright.

3238
02:10:25,750 --> 02:10:27,250
I'm getting another car.

3239
02:10:27,810 --> 02:10:31,390
I'm getting another car that I can't get the bus.

3240
02:10:33,050 --> 02:10:33,990
Oh my God...

3241
02:10:34,290 --> 02:10:37,170
The damaging missions are the fucking worst!

3242
02:10:37,810 --> 02:10:40,770
They are actually the fucking worst missions in this game!

3243
02:10:44,550 --> 02:10:46,550
They will be the death of me.

3244
02:10:50,910 --> 02:10:52,490
What do you... What?

3245
02:10:52,870 --> 02:10:55,590
Okay, why put a fucking wrench in there?

3246
02:10:55,950 --> 02:10:58,030
It's like... Oh my god.

3247
02:10:58,730 --> 02:11:00,110
No, no Doki, calm down.

3248
02:11:00,850 --> 02:11:01,630
Calm down.

3249
02:11:01,830 --> 02:11:02,930
I don't know where to go.

3250
02:11:03,790 --> 02:11:04,710
Where is he?

3251
02:11:04,850 --> 02:11:06,250
Where even is the truck anymore?

3252
02:11:06,470 --> 02:11:07,930
Where did the truck go?

3253
02:11:08,370 --> 02:11:16,290
Where did... I'm gonna sit here while I... Guys, I'm gonna bet the mission fail and then I'm gonna use the bathroom.

3254
02:11:16,490 --> 02:11:18,650
I'm not trying for this part.

3255
02:12:13,950 --> 02:12:15,210
Okay, I'm ready for real.

3256
02:12:15,450 --> 02:12:17,610
I'm so ready.

3257
02:12:17,930 --> 02:12:19,290
I'm so ready, guys.

3258
02:12:19,630 --> 02:12:20,590
This time I'm built.

3259
02:12:20,750 --> 02:12:21,570
I got the bus.

3260
02:12:22,250 --> 02:12:23,710
There's nothing they can do now.

3261
02:12:23,950 --> 02:12:26,370
I don't know where the car is, but there's nothing they can do now.

3262
02:12:26,950 --> 02:12:27,990
I'm so ready.

3263
02:12:28,610 --> 02:12:29,050
Auto.

3264
02:12:29,150 --> 02:12:29,950
We got this, Auto.

3265
02:12:31,170 --> 02:12:31,610
Alright.

3266
02:12:32,410 --> 02:12:33,270
I'm so sad.

3267
02:12:33,390 --> 02:12:35,410
I put that guy in the corner and I fucked it up.

3268
02:12:37,950 --> 02:12:38,750
That's right.

3269
02:12:38,910 --> 02:12:39,270
That's right.

3270
02:12:39,370 --> 02:12:41,010
I am nothing to lose.

3271
02:12:41,730 --> 02:12:43,010
Oh, wait, wait, wait a minute.

3272
02:12:43,090 --> 02:12:43,830
You're not supposed to do that.

3273
02:12:44,310 --> 02:12:44,430
Wait.

3274
02:12:46,270 --> 02:12:46,890
Wait a minute.

3275
02:12:46,990 --> 02:12:48,530
You just... casually drove away?

3276
02:12:51,110 --> 02:12:52,050
Oh my god.

3277
02:12:52,410 --> 02:12:52,630
Geez.

3278
02:12:53,430 --> 02:12:55,430
Why can't I have a bigger car?

3279
02:12:56,710 --> 02:12:57,570
Oh, nice.

3280
02:12:58,130 --> 02:12:58,990
Guys, you like that?

3281
02:13:00,150 --> 02:13:01,310
That's called driving.

3282
02:13:08,910 --> 02:13:09,790
That's right.

3283
02:13:11,010 --> 02:13:12,110
Alright, nice.

3284
02:13:13,850 --> 02:13:14,870
Alright, nice.

3285
02:13:15,030 --> 02:13:16,610
I... oh my god.

3286
02:13:17,070 --> 02:13:20,030
Guys, please, there has to be an easier way.

3287
02:13:20,250 --> 02:13:21,750
What's the actual strat?

3288
02:13:23,830 --> 02:13:26,330
What's... what's the... how do they do this?

3289
02:13:26,690 --> 02:13:28,830
How do they speedrun this part?

3290
02:13:28,830 --> 02:13:29,570
I don't understand.

3291
02:13:29,570 --> 02:13:30,150
I don't understand.

3292
02:13:30,570 --> 02:13:35,570
How do they... how do they speedrun this is absolute hell.

3293
02:13:37,950 --> 02:13:40,030
Just ram harder.

3294
02:13:40,450 --> 02:13:42,130
I don't understand.

3295
02:13:44,050 --> 02:13:46,590
I'm ramming as much as I can.

3296
02:13:47,430 --> 02:13:48,210
Just hit it.

3297
02:13:48,210 --> 02:13:50,250
Just hit it really, really hard.

3298
02:13:51,270 --> 02:13:53,050
But like... I'm trying.

3299
02:13:53,050 --> 02:13:53,390
I'm trying.

3300
02:13:56,570 --> 02:13:57,450
Here you go.

3301
02:13:59,490 --> 02:14:00,490
Just...

3302
02:14:01,050 --> 02:14:01,770
Boom.

3303
02:14:02,710 --> 02:14:04,190
Alright, nice.

3304
02:14:04,430 --> 02:14:04,910
Cool.

3305
02:14:07,900 --> 02:14:09,780
Oh my god, what?

3306
02:14:13,520 --> 02:14:14,880
Try hard.

3307
02:14:15,600 --> 02:14:17,280
I don't understand.

3308
02:14:17,960 --> 02:14:21,480
I'm hitting everything but this stupid fucking truck.

3309
02:14:25,620 --> 02:14:26,200
Please!

3310
02:14:29,460 --> 02:14:30,040
Please!

3311
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:31,120
Just hit yourself.

3312
02:14:31,400 --> 02:14:32,100
Just hit yourself.

3313
02:14:32,300 --> 02:14:33,040
You're one hit.

3314
02:14:33,220 --> 02:14:33,880
Just hit yourself.

3315
02:14:34,140 --> 02:14:35,340
Smash into a tree.

3316
02:14:36,780 --> 02:14:38,100
I'll do my best.

3317
02:14:39,120 --> 02:14:40,380
I don't understand.

3318
02:14:42,100 --> 02:14:42,400
No!

3319
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:44,100
And I've missed.

3320
02:14:44,940 --> 02:14:46,800
And I've missed.

3321
02:14:47,680 --> 02:14:48,260
Okay.

3322
02:14:48,800 --> 02:14:49,160
Oh yeah.

3323
02:14:49,740 --> 02:14:50,480
Alright, here we go.

3324
02:14:50,620 --> 02:14:51,140
This time.

3325
02:14:51,140 --> 02:14:52,220
This time.

3326
02:14:52,440 --> 02:14:54,300
I'll do my best.

3327
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:57,020
There we go.

3328
02:14:57,440 --> 02:14:58,980
I'm not very good at this.

3329
02:15:00,140 --> 02:15:00,380
Alright.

3330
02:15:01,540 --> 02:15:02,400
Here you go.

3331
02:15:03,440 --> 02:15:04,380
Oh my god.

3332
02:15:04,560 --> 02:15:04,940
Oh my god.

3333
02:15:05,040 --> 02:15:05,640
Oh, I don't play!

3334
02:15:05,740 --> 02:15:07,000
It's just a tiny corner!

3335
02:15:08,600 --> 02:15:09,600
How do you...

3336
02:15:09,600 --> 02:15:12,000
How do you speedrun this?

3337
02:15:12,340 --> 02:15:14,020
This is absolute hell.

3338
02:15:14,720 --> 02:15:16,120
I don't have any pockets.

3339
02:15:16,120 --> 02:15:17,020
Okay.

3340
02:15:17,600 --> 02:15:19,040
Are you even watching?

3341
02:15:19,380 --> 02:15:19,420
Oh!

3342
02:15:19,660 --> 02:15:20,180
Okay, guys.

3343
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:23,020
I used a dunder card to ram into him.

3344
02:15:24,200 --> 02:15:25,600
Yeah, who put that wall there?

3345
02:15:25,860 --> 02:15:27,220
It was out there when I was...

3346
02:15:27,220 --> 02:15:28,940
When I drove 10 years ago.

3347
02:15:29,260 --> 02:15:30,360
Oh my god.

3348
02:15:30,500 --> 02:15:32,120
And then the cops gonna come?!

3349
02:15:32,780 --> 02:15:34,860
Oh my god.

3350
02:15:36,320 --> 02:15:37,100
Here we go.

3351
02:15:40,180 --> 02:15:41,460
I don't understand.

3352
02:15:42,780 --> 02:15:44,640
You guided it to walls?

3353
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:45,360
I was up to...

3354
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:45,660
Where?

3355
02:15:45,800 --> 02:15:47,120
Where's the wall?!

3356
02:15:48,140 --> 02:15:50,140
I'm on the open road!

3357
02:15:53,660 --> 02:15:54,640
There we go.

3358
02:15:54,860 --> 02:15:55,480
There we go.

3359
02:15:55,700 --> 02:15:56,860
And I hit myself.

3360
02:15:57,080 --> 02:15:58,960
And then he drove around me.

3361
02:16:00,380 --> 02:16:01,720
Oh my god.

3362
02:16:03,660 --> 02:16:04,340
Please.

3363
02:16:06,460 --> 02:16:08,220
I don't understand.

3364
02:16:08,940 --> 02:16:11,100
Why are you like this?

3365
02:16:11,480 --> 02:16:12,580
Oh my god!

3366
02:16:12,580 --> 02:16:13,920
I'm trying to...

3367
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:14,180
I'm trying to...

3368
02:16:14,180 --> 02:16:17,000
How would I get arrested for doing my job?!

3369
02:16:18,840 --> 02:16:21,620
I shouldn't get arrested when I'm doing my own job.

3370
02:16:22,060 --> 02:16:22,700
There we go.

3371
02:16:24,680 --> 02:16:25,840
Oh my god.

3372
02:16:26,420 --> 02:16:26,820
I...

3373
02:16:26,820 --> 02:16:28,020
I almost missed too.

3374
02:16:28,120 --> 02:16:28,920
That was the worst...

3375
02:16:28,920 --> 02:16:29,700
That's the worst part.

3376
02:16:29,820 --> 02:16:31,420
The fact that I almost missed that jump.

3377
02:16:32,920 --> 02:16:34,040
Oh my god.

3378
02:16:34,260 --> 02:16:34,980
I got...

3379
02:16:35,580 --> 02:16:36,120
Okay, guys.

3380
02:16:36,260 --> 02:16:38,840
I gotta wait until the cops don't get me.

3381
02:16:38,840 --> 02:16:39,560
I can't...

3382
02:16:39,560 --> 02:16:40,580
I gotta wait here.

3383
02:16:40,860 --> 02:16:43,020
I gotta wait...

3384
02:16:44,620 --> 02:16:46,320
I gotta wait here.

3385
02:16:46,840 --> 02:16:48,000
Oh my god.

3386
02:16:48,180 --> 02:16:48,960
Give me a sec.

3387
02:16:49,020 --> 02:16:49,760
I gotta chill.

3388
02:16:50,200 --> 02:16:52,280
I gotta wait until it's ready.

3389
02:16:52,880 --> 02:16:53,840
I gotta wait...

3390
02:16:55,100 --> 02:16:57,780
I gotta wait before I commit more crime.

3391
02:16:58,400 --> 02:16:59,300
Alright, here we go.

3392
02:16:59,480 --> 02:17:00,100
Now we're fine.

3393
02:17:00,460 --> 02:17:01,200
Alright, nevermind.

3394
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:01,840
I hit a car.

3395
02:17:02,060 --> 02:17:03,760
But now we should be fine.

3396
02:17:05,780 --> 02:17:07,900
Now we can commit more crime, right?

3397
02:17:08,460 --> 02:17:10,660
Now we're legally allowed...

3398
02:17:10,660 --> 02:17:12,260
To commit more crime.

3399
02:17:14,300 --> 02:17:14,860
Okay.

3400
02:17:15,860 --> 02:17:16,720
Here we go.

3401
02:17:17,900 --> 02:17:18,720
That's right.

3402
02:17:20,120 --> 02:17:21,360
I'm coming for you.

3403
02:17:21,500 --> 02:17:23,020
How did you take zero damage?!

3404
02:17:23,020 --> 02:17:24,280
I'm right here!

3405
02:17:26,580 --> 02:17:27,560
Oh my god.

3406
02:17:27,800 --> 02:17:29,440
The little damage that I took.

3407
02:17:31,500 --> 02:17:33,460
Oh, that's gonna cost me.

3408
02:17:33,700 --> 02:17:35,080
I am so torn.

3409
02:17:35,120 --> 02:17:35,420
Alright.

3410
02:17:35,940 --> 02:17:36,620
In the corner.

3411
02:17:36,760 --> 02:17:37,620
In the corner.

3412
02:17:38,160 --> 02:17:38,740
In the corner.

3413
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:40,380
In the corner!

3414
02:17:40,660 --> 02:17:41,100
No!

3415
02:17:43,020 --> 02:17:43,620
No!

3416
02:17:44,400 --> 02:17:46,360
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3417
02:17:49,260 --> 02:17:49,860
Please.

3418
02:17:50,820 --> 02:17:52,440
You gotta go in the corner, sir.

3419
02:17:53,260 --> 02:17:54,780
How the fuck did I...

3420
02:17:54,780 --> 02:17:55,620
Oh shit.

3421
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:56,500
Oh shit.

3422
02:17:56,740 --> 02:17:57,620
Please, please.

3423
02:17:57,860 --> 02:17:58,500
Hit somebody.

3424
02:17:58,840 --> 02:17:59,520
Hit somebody.

3425
02:17:59,520 --> 02:18:00,420
Please.

3426
02:18:01,740 --> 02:18:02,340
Please.

3427
02:18:02,340 --> 02:18:03,020
That's all I want.

3428
02:18:03,320 --> 02:18:04,380
Please hit something.

3429
02:18:05,380 --> 02:18:05,780
Anything.

3430
02:18:07,780 --> 02:18:08,380
Yes!

3431
02:18:08,680 --> 02:18:08,920
Nice!

3432
02:18:09,720 --> 02:18:09,980
No!

3433
02:18:10,120 --> 02:18:11,340
I started automatically?!

3434
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:14,300
Oh my god.

3435
02:18:14,540 --> 02:18:15,540
Why did it start?

3436
02:18:16,680 --> 02:18:18,660
Why did it start automatically?

3437
02:18:18,860 --> 02:18:19,580
This is not fair.

3438
02:18:20,420 --> 02:18:21,580
This is not fair!

3439
02:18:23,320 --> 02:18:25,000
I just got here!

3440
02:18:28,630 --> 02:18:29,210
Nice!

3441
02:18:29,750 --> 02:18:29,890
Yes!

3442
02:18:30,090 --> 02:18:30,590
That was a big one!

3443
02:18:30,830 --> 02:18:32,130
Oh my god!

3444
02:18:32,570 --> 02:18:33,290
Oh my god.

3445
02:18:34,210 --> 02:18:34,550
Oh my god.

3446
02:18:34,870 --> 02:18:36,070
Guys, I might be getting better.

3447
02:18:36,490 --> 02:18:36,630
Guys.

3448
02:18:37,970 --> 02:18:38,810
Is this possible?

3449
02:18:39,970 --> 02:18:40,550
Guys!

3450
02:18:42,790 --> 02:18:43,310
Guys!

3451
02:18:43,790 --> 02:18:44,710
Could it be?

3452
02:18:45,610 --> 02:18:47,270
I'm getting better at driving?

3453
02:18:48,190 --> 02:18:49,210
I'm doing it!

3454
02:18:49,490 --> 02:18:50,470
Leave the driving to me, dude.

3455
02:18:51,210 --> 02:18:52,110
I'm doing it!

3456
02:18:52,450 --> 02:18:52,870
Oh, no.

3457
02:18:54,090 --> 02:18:55,030
Oh, okay.

3458
02:18:55,390 --> 02:18:56,610
Okay, I'm figuring it out.

3459
02:18:56,730 --> 02:18:58,230
I'm slowly figuring it out, guys.

3460
02:19:00,050 --> 02:19:01,030
Oh, fuck!

3461
02:19:04,020 --> 02:19:04,620
Oh, fuck!

3462
02:19:05,260 --> 02:19:06,300
Fuck your car!

3463
02:19:08,820 --> 02:19:09,420
No!

3464
02:19:11,540 --> 02:19:12,260
Oh, no.

3465
02:19:13,040 --> 02:19:13,600
Oh, no.

3466
02:19:13,780 --> 02:19:14,160
Where is it?

3467
02:19:14,340 --> 02:19:15,080
Where's the car?

3468
02:19:15,500 --> 02:19:16,400
Where is it?

3469
02:19:16,500 --> 02:19:16,640
Okay.

3470
02:19:19,720 --> 02:19:20,320
Alright.

3471
02:19:20,740 --> 02:19:21,580
That's fine.

3472
02:19:23,120 --> 02:19:23,960
That's fine.

3473
02:19:24,780 --> 02:19:25,680
That's fine!

3474
02:19:26,840 --> 02:19:28,680
Keep going against the walls!

3475
02:19:30,020 --> 02:19:30,540
Yes!

3476
02:19:32,780 --> 02:19:33,900
Drive into the train!

3477
02:19:34,100 --> 02:19:34,200
Yes!

3478
02:19:34,280 --> 02:19:34,720
Hit yourself!

3479
02:19:34,860 --> 02:19:35,280
Hit yourself!

3480
02:19:35,580 --> 02:19:37,380
Hit yourself!

3481
02:19:39,180 --> 02:19:39,960
Oh, no!

3482
02:19:40,460 --> 02:19:40,880
Oh, no!

3483
02:19:42,620 --> 02:19:43,320
No, no!

3484
02:19:43,400 --> 02:19:44,400
I'm losing track of it!

3485
02:19:44,600 --> 02:19:44,640
No!

3486
02:19:47,260 --> 02:19:47,780
Please!

3487
02:19:48,040 --> 02:19:48,820
Please hit yourself!

3488
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:49,820
Please hit yourself!

3489
02:19:50,460 --> 02:19:51,120
Please hit yourself!

3490
02:19:52,940 --> 02:19:53,460
No!

3491
02:19:59,770 --> 02:20:01,130
Oh my god!

3492
02:20:01,570 --> 02:20:02,290
Thank god!

3493
02:20:02,290 --> 02:20:03,890
Thank god!

3494
02:20:04,290 --> 02:20:04,910
Oh, no!

3495
02:20:05,090 --> 02:20:09,690
Don't you do not give me the cops after everything I've been through!

3496
02:20:10,430 --> 02:20:11,730
Slow and steady.

3497
02:20:12,090 --> 02:20:13,930
We follow traffic laws.

3498
02:20:14,390 --> 02:20:16,750
We are law-abiding citizens.

3499
02:20:17,270 --> 02:20:18,670
Look at us go!

3500
02:20:18,670 --> 02:20:18,810
Oh!

3501
02:20:21,330 --> 02:20:22,010
Oh!

3502
02:20:22,010 --> 02:20:22,050
Oh!

3503
02:20:22,090 --> 02:20:22,610
And then- Oh!

3504
02:20:22,670 --> 02:20:23,850
There's a stop sign!

3505
02:20:24,430 --> 02:20:25,970
Look- Look both ways!

3506
02:20:26,630 --> 02:20:27,010
Alright!

3507
02:20:28,210 --> 02:20:29,390
Left turn!

3508
02:20:30,470 --> 02:20:32,930
Now we're law-abiding citizens.

3509
02:20:33,270 --> 02:20:33,290
Oh!

3510
02:20:33,450 --> 02:20:34,930
There's another stop sign!

3511
02:20:34,930 --> 02:20:37,270
What do you mean get away from Wiggle!

3512
02:20:39,490 --> 02:20:40,690
What do you mean?

3513
02:20:41,470 --> 02:20:43,550
Get away from Wiggle!

3514
02:20:43,550 --> 02:20:44,550
What do you mean?

3515
02:20:44,550 --> 02:20:50,390
Everything- After everything I've been through, I'm being chased by the cops!

3516
02:20:50,690 --> 02:20:53,930
Are you fucking- This car is so bad for chasing!

3517
02:20:53,930 --> 02:20:57,650
This is- This is a drive- This is a rav car!

3518
02:20:58,150 --> 02:21:00,210
I can't believe it!

3519
02:21:00,610 --> 02:21:02,450
This is not fair!

3520
02:21:03,370 --> 02:21:05,230
Oh my god!

3521
02:21:07,170 --> 02:21:07,990
No!

3522
02:21:08,870 --> 02:21:13,090
And then the- And then the actual cops are here!

3523
02:21:13,090 --> 02:21:15,090
Oh, that's a break down- Don't!

3524
02:21:18,610 --> 02:21:19,890
Don't!

3525
02:21:23,810 --> 02:21:25,090
Don't!

3526
02:21:25,090 --> 02:21:25,590
Don'tело!

3527
02:21:26,230 --> 02:21:27,370
Don't!

3528
02:21:27,370 --> 02:21:27,390
Don't!

3529
02:21:27,390 --> 02:21:29,630
This car was not been in...

3530
02:21:29,690 --> 02:21:30,390
Don't!

3531
02:21:32,130 --> 02:21:34,250
It's not fair!

3532
02:21:35,010 --> 02:21:36,630
Don't-

3533
02:21:40,030 --> 02:21:40,670
Oh!

3534
02:21:41,310 --> 02:21:41,790
No!

3535
02:21:41,790 --> 02:21:41,890
No!

3536
02:21:43,410 --> 02:21:44,990
I did...

3537
02:21:45,570 --> 02:21:46,270
No!

3538
02:21:47,530 --> 02:21:48,670
No!

3539
02:21:51,510 --> 02:21:52,210
No!

3540
02:22:40,800 --> 02:22:41,980
I just...
