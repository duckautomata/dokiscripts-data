1
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,640
What's, like, the common factor out of all of us here?

2
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,220
Gamers.

3
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,300
Yeah, but, like, what else?

4
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,140
What else do we all have in common?

5
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:01,820
Money.

6
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,040
But everybody has money.

7
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,460
Money, in, like, some way or form.

8
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,880
Right.

9
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:21,140
So, like, that's not really a good comparison, because that's, like, comparing us to chat.

10
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,420
Because we all have money.

11
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,380
But what makes us different from chat?

12
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,440
We're all, like, living, breathing.

13
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,600
Yeah, but chat's living and breathing.

14
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,020
Chat's living and breathing.

15
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,380
Yeah.

16
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,840
No, they're not.

17
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,680
Chat isn't real.

18
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,260
Oh, shit, you're right.

19
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,400
Me and my zero viewers.

20
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,480
Oh, shit, you're right.

21
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:42,800
What the...

22
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,000
Okay, but, like, what else?

23
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,380
Like, don't you have something that we also have?

24
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:49,700
No.

25
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,680
Don't you...

26
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,660
Don't you remember you have a...

27
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,480
We have different things.

28
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:02,260
What do you mean, don't you have that, you know, that particularly animate, like, thing in your folders?

29
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,760
I don't think so.

30
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,680
Don't you mean a...

31
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,600
I'm getting gassed right now.

32
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,860
Don't you mean, like, you know...

33
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,200
You know, did you have, like, a...

34
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:23,760
VTuber model that you're sure for that you streamed, like, oh, really, can you chat, like, pull up, like, clips of you using that VTuber model?

35
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,160
Unfortunately, it's not Tuesday, so...

36
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,960
Oh, so, so you do have a VTuber model.

37
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,220
No, VTubers aren't real, so...

38
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,580
Then what's the Tuesday thing?

39
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,020
Yeah.

40
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:40,840
So, it's not Tuesday.

41
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,640
Yeah, but what is the Tuesday thing?

42
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,200
If VTubers aren't real?

43
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,980
I don't know.

44
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,240
What is it?

45
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:47,620
What...

46
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,720
Can you please elaborate?

47
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,840
What happens when Tuesday stays on Tuesday?

48
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,840
What happens when Tuesday stays on Tuesday?

49
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,660
So, if I ask you again on Tuesday, will you tell me what...

50
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,140
Would you say what it is?

51
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,960
No, I'd say, fuck you, bitch.

52
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,900
Oh, so, anyway, I'm live now, as well.

53
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,600
Are you live, as well, Surefour?

54
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,120
Yeah.

55
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:16,720
Okay.

56
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:17,680
Alright.

57
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,040
So, hello, everybody.

58
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,280
Welcome to the Party Animals Twitch Rivals team.

59
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,540
We went straight into it with no introduction whatsoever.

60
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:27,900
Yippee!

61
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,540
Just like how we do our Twitch Rivals.

62
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,840
Anyway, this is my team.

63
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,660
Ditto, Surefour, and Brie.

64
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,760
Um...

65
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:43,280
I honestly thought that, like, some of them had Party Animals experience.

66
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,900
As in, like, a lot of Party Animals experience.

67
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,100
And that's why I recruited.

68
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,800
I have 7.3 hours.

69
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,080
Did you do several tournaments?

70
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,520
You did, like, two Twitch Rivals tournaments.

71
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,600
No, not Twitch Rivals.

72
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,220
But you did two, like, Party Animals tournaments.

73
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,640
How much did you guys do?

74
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,220
I don't understand.

75
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,840
What did you guys do?

76
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,620
Team threw.

77
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,400
Oh.

78
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,320
It's teams fought.

79
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,060
So what's your placement?

80
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,040
I don't remember.

81
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,400
All I remember is the Murder Crumpets team had a mute that, like, played the game 24-7.

82
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,100
And then, like...

83
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:16,800
What the fuck?

84
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,560
They soloed the team.

85
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,600
They soloed...

86
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
They, like, destroyed...

87
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,440
So they destroyed...

88
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,880
You got destroyed by a mute?

89
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,680
I didn't get destroyed.

90
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,160
You got...

91
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,620
But you said destroyed the team.

92
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,820
Yeah, it's a team game.

93
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,440
Yeah, but it's...

94
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,540
So you're part of the team.

95
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,100
So you got destroyed.

96
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:32,720
Yeah, I lost.

97
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,580
With the team.

98
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,880
Yeah, so you got destroyed.

99
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,300
So you're not a God of War.

100
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:36,500
You're not a God gamer.

101
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,680
Well, you know, there's percentages of, like, effort in the team.

102
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,480
And what's your percentage?

103
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,500
I'm, like, 90.

104
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,220
You're, like...

105
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,760
Oh, you were 90% of the team.

106
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,180
Yeah.

107
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,460
So the mute destroyed 90% of the team.

108
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,380
Okay.

109
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,600
Yeah.

110
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,100
Yeah.

111
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,500
But if you're 90% of the team and the mute destroyed your team, you got destroyed by the mute.

112
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,540
Okay, listen.

113
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,860
I was, like, 60% of the team.

114
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,260
I was, like, 80% in the PAL World team.

115
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,920
I was, like, 60 to 80 in the PAL World team, too.

116
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:12,820
I don't want to be hearing this.

117
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,400
What do you mean?

118
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,940
In PAL World, we all did an equal contribution to the team.

119
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,740
I quote, Surefour, you have to carry us.

120
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,320
You're the carry.

121
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,940
Yeah, and you died to a fucking bug.

122
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,980
I can't...

123
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,920
That can't be controlled.

124
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,540
All I'm saying is if you didn't die to that bug, we could have got third place.

125
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,360
Yeah, well, maybe if you made me more Poke Balls.

126
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,380
Oh, yeah.

127
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,380
Yeah, we made you a collection of Poke Balls.

128
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:50,900
What do you mean?

129
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,380
I needed more of a collection.

130
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,580
You did not need a...

131
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,040
It was not the PAL Balls that was the issue here.

132
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,180
It was.

133
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,320
I had to clutch out with, like, minimum PAL Balls.

134
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,860
That'd be great.

135
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,260
Oh, my God.

136
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:05,700
He was Glorp -ing my shit, bro.

137
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,080
Oh, my God.

138
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:08,700
What?

139
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,540
He was Glorp-ing his shit.

140
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,000
Oh, okay, yeah.

141
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,300
I just...

142
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,940
I just wanted to make sure I heard correctly.

143
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,340
Thank you.

144
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:14,800
Okay, yeah.

145
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,580
You know Glorp?

146
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,320
Glorpnorphin?

147
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,240
No.

148
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,200
Yeah, Glorp.

149
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:18,880
It's a little cat.

150
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,820
It's a little green cat with antennas.

151
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,440
Oh, you're talking about the cast thinking about that SpongeBob rapper?

152
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,340
No, I'm talking about Glorp.

153
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,080
Glorp?

154
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,300
What the fuck is Glorp?

155
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,040
There's Glorp.

156
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,040
And there's Glorp.

157
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,900
Oh, my God.

158
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,820
Wait, he's so cute.

159
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,600
Yeah, he's Glorp-ing.

160
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,500
Oh.

161
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,660
Yeah, he's Glorp.

162
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,340
But that makes sense.

163
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:36,620
Yeah.

164
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,340
There's Y'Lorp.

165
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,060
And there's Orlorp.

166
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,020
Basically, there's a color for every Orp.

167
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,400
There's a color for every Orp?

168
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,500
Wait, what are the Orps?

169
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,940
Well, there's like Blorp, and that's blue.

170
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,660
And then what?

171
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,440
Orp?

172
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,320
I have to look.

173
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,060
You have to look?

174
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,260
You don't know them by heart?

175
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:00,640
All I know is the...

176
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,740
No, I only have Glorp.

177
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,480
Glorp, let's go.

178
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,400
It looks like a Neopet.

179
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,000
I love him.

180
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,100
Glorp.

181
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:07,980
Cat.

182
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,340
Basically, the beginning letter is the color.

183
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,120
And Glorp is Glorp because it's green.

184
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,240
Is there Yorp?

185
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,500
Yorp?

186
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,200
There might be...

187
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,140
There's no Yorp.

188
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,820
There's no yellow.

189
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,780
There's no yellow cat.

190
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,700
There's Blorp.

191
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,240
Is there Blorp?

192
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:23,540
There is a yellow one.

193
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,460
No, there isn't.

194
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:24,940
There's Blorp.

195
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,360
I don't see any.

196
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:26,580
Is there...

197
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,640
I think this is a myth.

198
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,600
I think only Glorp.

199
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:32,960
No.

200
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,280
It's real.

201
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:34,460
I think this is a myth.

202
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,480
I only see Glorp.

203
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,780
There's no proof.

204
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,080
You only see what you want to see.

205
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,140
And then where's the...

206
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,020
Where the fuck is Yorp?

207
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,820
Where's Yorp?

208
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,540
I'm looking for him.

209
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,300
I'm looking for him.

210
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,400
Yeah, you can't find him.

211
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,280
No, I can.

212
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,460
Where's Yorp?

213
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,900
Yeah, he's gaslighting.

214
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,260
No, I'm not.

215
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,400
Yeah, I found...

216
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,360
Here's Yalorp.

217
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,360
Where is it?

218
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,900
Posted in a Team 3 chat.

219
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,260
My Team 3 team...

220
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,120
There we go.

221
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,280
There we go.

222
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:06,400
There we go.

223
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:06,940
There we go.

224
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:06,960
There we go.

225
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,560
Wait, there is Yorp.

226
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,100
Oh my God.

227
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,860
Wait, how did you find Yorp?

228
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,400
My chat helped me.

229
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,520
Oh, so you didn't do any of the work.

230
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:18,840
I got helpers.

231
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,700
So you didn't do any of the work.

232
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,420
No, it's a...

233
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,600
You ever heard of a community?

234
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,500
It's a community effort.

235
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,680
Wait, I thought chat wasn't real.

236
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,420
Then how are they helping you if chat isn't real?

237
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,160
You know, like schizophrenics where they have voices in their head?

238
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,040
What's that?

239
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,900
So the voices in your head helped you.

240
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,260
Oh, we're getting pinged for stuff now.

241
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,080
Okay, nice.

242
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:45,560
What?

243
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,580
Who are we?

244
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,280
All right.

245
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,720
It's time to find the lobby.

246
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,680
Please be careful.

247
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,860
Does this hide the code when we join it?

248
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,260
Okay, okay.

249
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:53,960
I have no idea.

250
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,920
I'm gonna fucking hide my game screen first.

251
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,260
I don't know.

252
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,580
Oh, I joined a random game.

253
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,440
Okay, custom game.

254
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:00,880
Oh my God.

255
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,440
Okay.

256
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,460
Custom game.

257
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,520
And then you search it up.

258
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:05,700
Okay.

259
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,060
Okay.

260
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,400
Search.

261
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,980
What time is it over there for you, Ditto?

262
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
Ditto, what time is it?

263
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,440
It's 4 a.m.

264
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,700
Oh, no.

265
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,780
She's locked in.

266
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,440
I can find it, Bobby.

267
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,280
Maybe it's not up yet.

268
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:27,820
Oh, no.

269
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,200
It's up.

270
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:28,720
I'm in it.

271
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:28,980
Oh, I can see it.

272
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,160
I got it.

273
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,600
I would join JoyGaden.

274
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,380
Yeah, yeah.

275
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:32,840
Join me.

276
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,640
I'm in.

277
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,680
Also, it does show up.

278
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,040
It does show the code.

279
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,800
Oh, Doki.

280
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,740
You're on an online.

281
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,060
Oh, I'll invite you in.

282
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:40,960
Let me see.

283
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,300
Okay.

284
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,580
Let's see.

285
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,720
Where are you?

286
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,560
Oh, wait.

287
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,340
Give me a sec.

288
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,860
Let me see if I can invite you.

289
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,400
Oh, my friend.

290
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,940
Oh, I need to add you in this.

291
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,320
Oh, wait.

292
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,380
No.

293
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,040
I got you.

294
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:54,840
Okay.

295
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,080
I sent you in.

296
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,340
Did you get it?

297
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,200
Are you Pussy Slayer?

298
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:00,540
Yeah.

299
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,520
Is that Pussy Slayer?

300
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,380
Yeah.

301
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,060
Yeah.

302
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,640
Yeah.

303
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:05,680
Yeah.

304
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,220
He's Pussy Slayer, by the way.

305
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,020
Oh, my God.

306
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,420
Oh, my God.

307
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,740
He's here to slay some cats.

308
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,180
I'm not thinking I'd be in Twitch Rivals.

309
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,340
It's okay.

310
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,080
We're so locked in.

311
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,720
I was watching Drops Team fucking scrimming.

312
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,760
They were scrimming party animals for like two weeks.

313
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,780
Two to three weeks.

314
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,660
Why didn't you set up a party animal?

315
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:35,760
Yeah.

316
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,520
I set up scrims.

317
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,500
Why did I not set up scrims?

318
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,180
Would you actually join scrims?

319
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,440
Yeah, you're a team leader.

320
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,400
If I set it up, would you though, Surefour?

321
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,940
Yeah, I'll take that as a fucking no.

322
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,700
I'm always down for scrims.

323
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,280
Yeah, I don't think you would fucking scrim party animals.

324
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,660
Yeah, I was watching fucking Drops with the full on apes.

325
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,080
Apex roster screaming at party animals and hard-comming.

326
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,440
It was actually crazy.

327
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,920
Apex players are sweats.

328
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,100
Wait, what's the comparison between...

329
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,540
What about Apex versus Overwatch?

330
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,280
Who's sweatier?

331
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,520
Apex?

332
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:26,620
I think Overwatch tries to be sweatier, but it just comes across more depressing.

333
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,300
Oh shit, is that true?

334
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,460
No one talks in Overwatch anymore.

335
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,960
As an Overwatch player, are you sweaty?

336
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,640
Yeah.

337
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,360
We've gone through enough one-tricks that never swap.

338
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,680
We've become complacent with everything.

339
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,600
That's so true!

340
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,960
I was the one-trick.

341
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,780
So, you know...

342
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,820
You were the problem.

343
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,240
I was in Mercy main.

344
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,380
And I was in D.Va main.

345
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,700
You were part of the problem.

346
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,560
You were 100%.

347
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,500
I avoided you.

348
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,560
I avoided you and reported you.

349
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,220
Oh no.

350
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,760
No, no, no.

351
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,880
No, no, no, no.

352
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,440
Do you know what the game mode is?

353
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,760
It's Lollipop Factory.

354
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:08,980
Lollipop... yeah.

355
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,400
Yeah, it's the one where you...

356
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,920
You collect the cheese.

357
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,920
Yeah, and then you have to move it to a little tray.

358
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,980
And then you have to pull the lever to put the tray in.

359
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,720
And then there's a big gummy bear that's worth way more.

360
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,380
Yeah, I'm just gonna be beating the shit out of them.

361
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,060
Okay, so what's the strat for this?

362
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,300
I remember when I tried to play this and I got absolutely destroyed.

363
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,080
You have people trying to stop them from putting in candy.

364
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,200
And then you have people on your team putting in the candy.

365
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,560
And I'm gonna be interference.

366
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:36,700
Okay.

367
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,900
I'm just gonna be beating the shit.

368
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,200
I'll help bring candy over.

369
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,700
You gotta protect me.

370
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,620
And I will bring candy over.

371
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,700
I don't know what Bree is gonna do.

372
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,420
I will beat people up.

373
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,140
Okay.

374
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,680
Are you good at beating people up?

375
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,300
Yes.

376
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,460
Okay, okay.

377
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,860
And you're not lying to me like how you lied earlier, right?

378
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,360
I would never.

379
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,260
I will protect you.

380
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,020
I'm indiscriminate in my beating.

381
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:05,820
Alright.

382
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,180
Wait, no, you're not supposed to beat us up.

383
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,160
You're part of the team.

384
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,440
If I have an AOE weapon and you guys are caught in the crossfire, there's nothing I can do about it.

385
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,000
Then we lose!

386
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,560
I thought you wanna win!

387
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,420
Hey, listen.

388
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,920
If I have the lollipop stick...

389
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,760
This is party animals.

390
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,620
This is serious.

391
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,960
There's AOE.

392
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:25,940
I'm serious.

393
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,420
But you're a gamer.

394
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,400
That's why I'm saying...

395
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,600
That's why I'm forewarning at the beginning.

396
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,700
But you're a gamer.

397
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,020
You should be able to, like, control the beatings.

398
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:35,640
No, listen.

399
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,500
I can't control the actions of my teammates.

400
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,180
I can only control myself.

401
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,940
Yorp is just on my screen.

402
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,020
Oh, I'm ready.

403
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,040
Yeah, he's just yorping.

404
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,560
Alright, here we go.

405
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,800
I believe in us.

406
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,660
We're so ready.

407
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,400
No, we got this.

408
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,060
We're so ready.

409
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,400
Oh yeah, we're gonna win.

410
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,320
Alright.

411
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,900
Where am I?

412
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:03,760
Okay, here I am.

413
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,600
We have to go grab the candy.

414
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:06,960
The candy!

415
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:07,460
Let's go!

416
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:07,760
Let's go!

417
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,000
Let's go!

418
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,660
Beat him up, Trevor!

419
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,340
Beat him up, Bri!

420
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,860
I got a taser.

421
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,100
Oh, they're going for the big one!

422
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,520
Oh my god.

423
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,100
I'm trying to pull... get the little ones.

424
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,700
Somebody beat up the big ones while I grab the little ones!

425
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,340
I'm grabbing it.

426
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,000
Wait, where's the...

427
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,220
I'm punishing them.

428
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,860
Wait, where's the...

429
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,340
I'm going.

430
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:29,540
I'm going.

431
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,300
Guys, I actually don't remember where the...

432
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,320
Where the...

433
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:34,500
The what?

434
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,700
Where is our area?

435
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,300
Oh, there it is.

436
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,620
We're red.

437
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,560
We're red.

438
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,140
Take the candy.

439
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:41,620
Take the candy.

440
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,400
Okay, I'm grabbing the mini candies.

441
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,480
Don't worry, guys.

442
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,200
I got it.

443
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,740
Nice.

444
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:47,760
No!

445
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,400
Wait,

446
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,120
we got the big one?

447
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,040
Wait, we got the big one?

448
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,360
Nice.

449
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,540
Am I... Oh, I can't pull it!

450
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,780
Guys, help!

451
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,440
I can't pull it!

452
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,320
Somebody help me!

453
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,340
He's fucking punching me!

454
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,800
I need somebody to help me pull it!

455
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,020
I got it!

456
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,340
I got it!

457
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,340
Big?

458
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,560
I've been punching the shit out of them over here.

459
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,520
Just keep getting the big one and we win.

460
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,700
I had trouble fucking...

461
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,560
Okay, I need somebody to help me.

462
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,800
I need help!

463
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,440
I need help!

464
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:30,840
Yes!

465
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,660
Wait, I don't think...

466
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,800
You have to go the long way.

467
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,840
You have to go the long way.

468
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,760
You can't do it from there.

469
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,860
Up the ramp!

470
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,660
Guys, help me!

471
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,560
Liam's trying to beat me up!

472
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,840
Liam's got me!

473
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,680
I'm grabbing the small one.

474
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,860
You guys go do your thing.

475
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,900
You guys go do your thing.

476
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,720
You guys don't tip me.

477
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,540
You guys don't tip me.

478
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,520
You guys don't tip me.

479
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,500
I'm slowly heading over.

480
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:02,840
I'm slowly heading over.

481
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,500
Oh, he's got the pants.

482
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,000
Oh no!

483
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:05,900
Liam!

484
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,440
Get off of me!

485
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,020
They're getting the big one!

486
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:10,720
We need to stop!

487
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:14,560
Okay, somebody fell in there.

488
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,200
I don't know who that was.

489
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,520
That's me.

490
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,820
Guys, we need help.

491
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,880
They're about to get the big one.

492
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,940
I hope you guys are doing it.

493
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,760
If you can just keep getting the small ones, it's fine.

494
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,020
We got him trapped under here.

495
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,760
No, don't please!

496
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,620
I'm just a little dog!

497
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,320
I'm grabbing the small ones.

498
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:35,600
Please!

499
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,260
Run, run, Ditto!

500
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,040
He's on me!

501
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,620
We're holding hands!

502
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,540
Nice, nice, nice.

503
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,500
I'm just going!

504
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,180
Oh, you stole the big one?

505
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,020
Nice, nice.

506
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

507
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:51,820
Okay.

508
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:52,920
Nice, nice, nice.

509
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,900
I got three of them down right here.

510
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,740
You can steal it.

511
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,640
It's okay.

512
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,640
Just keep grabbing.

513
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,920
He's too busy on me.

514
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,900
Oh, take it, take it, take it.

515
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,280
I got him.

516
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:03,860
I got him unlocked.

517
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,360
It's okay.

518
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,140
I'll go put this on here.

519
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,620
I'm coming.

520
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm coming if someone can get the lever.

521
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,980
If someone can get the lever.

522
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,740
I got the big one.

523
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,740
Oh my god.

524
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,640
We win.

525
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,000
We win.

526
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,280
We win.

527
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:20,720
Wait.

528
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,520
Yeah.

529
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,820
Guys, I used the cooldown.

530
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:24,760
I used the cooldown.

531
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,280
I used the cooldown for a small one.

532
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:26,900
I didn't realize.

533
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,960
Pull the trigger.

534
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,160
Pull the trigger.

535
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,380
A trick.

536
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,920
A trick.

537
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,240
I can't do well in a penalty game.

538
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,140
We did it.

539
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:37,780
Yippee.

540
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,160
We did it.

541
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,740
See the line on my resume, Maya.

542
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,740
Okay, sure.

543
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,680
How much did Bri actually help?

544
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,460
They clutched out by stealing.

545
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,520
They clutched out stealing it while I was just fucking perma knocking three of them on the ground.

546
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,320
Guys.

547
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,800
Wait, is it?

548
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,600
Do we do it again?

549
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,600
I don't know.

550
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,180
I thought it was only one.

551
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,560
Best of three?

552
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,560
Best of three.

553
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,060
Is it again?

554
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,040
Do we have to go through it again?

555
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,340
No, it's game two is buzz ball.

556
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,000
Oh, I know buzz ball.

557
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:31,820
What is buzz ball?

558
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,280
Do we do it?

559
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:32,420
What?

560
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,460
That's the one where...

561
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,620
I don't know.

562
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,260
Let's just play until something happens.

563
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,680
Yeah, let's just play it.

564
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,560
Yeah, they're going for it.

565
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,280
They're going for it.

566
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:41,820
Oh!

567
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,660
I'm going.

568
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,100
I'm dragging it.

569
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:45,780
No!

570
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,580
I'm going for the little ones.

571
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,020
Fuck this.

572
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,580
You guys can deal with that.

573
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,440
I know my place.

574
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,340
Punch him.

575
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:52,900
Punch him.

576
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,340
Nice.

577
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,000
You got him.

578
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,380
Oh, game is ending.

579
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,540
We won the game.

580
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,280
Yay!

581
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:06,920
Okay, I'm pretty sure buzz ball is the one where there's a ball and you have to throw it in the goal and if you hold it too long it explodes.

582
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,260
Oh, okay.

583
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,200
Oh, okay.

584
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,400
Oh, yeah.

585
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,240
It's like soccer.

586
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,900
Okay, I get it.

587
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:14,720
Yay!

588
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,820
I got a cow!

589
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,900
Got the avatar.

590
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:25,440
I'm glad we're unlocking characters that we get from playing the game once.

591
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:27,880
It's okay.

592
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,840
You know what?

593
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,680
After that first game, you know what?

594
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,600
I believe in us.

595
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,160
I didn't believe in us before we started, but now I believe in us.

596
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,260
It's hot.

597
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:46,600
If you get into that little thing at the end and you just press right click, it usually gets thrown in.

598
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,120
Okay.

599
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,640
Boom.

600
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,380
I'm using controller, so let's right click on the controller.

601
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,240
I don't know.

602
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,320
I use keyboard and mouse.

603
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,680
Whatever you throw is...

604
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,460
If two people hold onto the ball, it explodes.

605
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,320
Oh, okay.

606
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,500
So we shouldn't hold... okay.

607
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,200
We can.

608
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,340
Sometimes it's clutch.

609
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,600
You gotta right click it!

610
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:10,880
Yay!

611
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,060
You just locked up and just locked?

612
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,680
What the hell just happened?

613
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,500
I did it!

614
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,060
So that's the throw button.

615
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,580
That's easy as!

616
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:30,800
No!

617
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,140
Oh god!

618
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,540
Alright, go, go, go!

619
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,060
Okay, I know two!

620
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:38,860
You got it!

621
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,900
Someone punched me out.

622
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,640
It wasn't me, I swear.

623
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,560
I know.

624
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,920
It was an enemy.

625
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,520
The bats got it!

626
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,730
Nice steal, nice steal!

627
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,490
I got knocked out.

628
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,010
Get it out.

629
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:01,970
Just hold on to it.

630
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,470
That's fine, that's fine.

631
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,330
That's fine, that's fine.

632
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,510
No, it's not fine!

633
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,850
It's not fine!

634
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,770
It was in the end not fine.

635
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,470
We got the bad RNG.

636
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,270
I was hoping it would go to their side.

637
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:22,970
Alright, here we go.

638
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:23,910
Alright, here we go.

639
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:24,730
This time we got it.

640
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,110
I believe in us, team.

641
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,070
Oh no.

642
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:28,850
Oh my god.

643
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:29,810
Oh my god, that's you.

644
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:32,850
Nice throw.

645
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,210
Come on, go Pussy Slayer, go!

646
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,250
No, Pussy Slayer!

647
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,190
I got knocked out.

648
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,250
I got knocked out too!

649
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,150
No!

650
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:45,890
I got knocked out!

651
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:46,690
No!

652
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:50,770
Okay, guys.

653
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:52,730
Now I don't have confidence anymore.

654
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,390
Hey, we're only down one.

655
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,790
Do the thing you did last time.

656
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,030
Okay, I'll just run and grab it.

657
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,350
It's sixth, it's sixth.

658
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,370
I'm trying to grab him.

659
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,010
I grabbed him instead!

660
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,270
You got it, you got it!

661
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,450
Oh my god, it won't let me!

662
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,870
Okay, I'm just running again.

663
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:18,830
I'm running, no!

664
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,970
No, please, please have mercy!

665
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:22,130
No!

666
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,470
No, you knocked me out before I could get there!

667
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,410
I got knocked out!

668
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:28,630
Wait, winnable?

669
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,090
No!

670
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:31,530
Knocked out again!

671
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,110
It's up to you, Pussy Slayer!

672
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,090
Go, go, go, go, go!

673
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:38,710
Nice.

674
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:39,750
Nice pass.

675
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:42,790
Oh, I knocked him out.

676
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:43,430
Get it, get it.

677
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,410
Throw it in.

678
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:45,930
Nice!

679
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:46,450
Yay!

680
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,910
Now we're tied.

681
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,330
We did it, we're doing it, guys!

682
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,610
We're doing it!

683
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:00,770
See?

684
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:02,470
Winnable.

685
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,410
It is, oh my god, it is winnable!

686
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:06,190
Winnable.

687
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,430
Who would've thought?

688
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:08,970
I got knocked out.

689
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,130
Why?

690
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:13,990
Okay.

691
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,290
It's fine.

692
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:17,250
It's fine.

693
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:19,970
Get over here!

694
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:20,270
Okay.

695
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,550
You're holding onto me!

696
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:22,170
Oh, I'm so sorry.

697
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,550
Oh, nice throw!

698
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,790
Yeah, but he's heading over.

699
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,450
It's fine, we got it near their goal.

700
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,970
No, he punched it away!

701
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,830
It's not near our goal anymore!

702
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,210
I'll wait for you, I'll wait for the throw.

703
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,770
I'll wait for the throw.

704
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,190
Oh god, oh god.

705
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:40,810
I'm knocked out.

706
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,230
Oh, big knockout!

707
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,630
We'll throw it if you need to.

708
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:47,970
You got it!

709
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:48,670
Go, go, go!

710
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:49,830
We got it, we got it, we got it!

711
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:50,190
Yes!

712
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:50,850
Yay!

713
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,810
Only three more to go.

714
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:57,870
Oh my god.

715
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:58,810
It's gone, it's gone.

716
00:24:59,330 --> 00:24:59,690
Yeah.

717
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,930
Pussy slayer with the goal.

718
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,370
Pussy slayer goal!

719
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,200
Got it.

720
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,560
Wait a minute.

721
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,020
Oh!

722
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:13,840
You're juke- Oh!

723
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:15,880
Yes!

724
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:17,760
Yes!

725
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,020
Let's go!

726
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,620
I don't need practice, look at us!

727
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,140
Just do that every single time.

728
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,860
Just run it down mid every single time.

729
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,440
Just run it down!

730
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,260
I knew Tyler Warner was right in some ways.

731
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,220
My philosophy, run it down.

732
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,320
Okay, never mind, I'm out.

733
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,380
Oh no, oh no, oh no!

734
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,020
It's fine, he fucked up, he fucked up.

735
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:42,840
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

736
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,440
Oh no, oh no!

737
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,360
He didn't fuck up!

738
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,140
You liar!

739
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,220
It's okay, this will make the comeback better.

740
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:50,640
It's fine.

741
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,900
Instead of punching him, I just need to grab him.

742
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,080
Because the punch was missing.

743
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,020
Yeah, that's not good.

744
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,340
I grabbed someone and I dragged him away.

745
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,120
Okay.

746
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,840
Run it down mid.

747
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,680
Run it down mid and then I'll fucking do this.

748
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,260
No, no, I'm out, I'm out!

749
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:09,680
No!

750
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,820
I'm out, he got me.

751
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,180
I'm out forever.

752
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,640
I'm missing!

753
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,460
No, I'm missing everything!

754
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,260
Oh, he fucked up, he fucked up.

755
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,620
I'm not out?

756
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,640
Oh no, he didn't fuck up yet!

757
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,980
Okay, I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting.

758
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,920
Oh, I'm waiting, I'm waiting.

759
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,880
I'm right here waiting for you.

760
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,140
Nice, nice, nice!

761
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:31,860
Nice!

762
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,020
Nice!

763
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,360
Oh my god, is this the next Messi right there?

764
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,400
No, no, no!

765
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,380
Goal!

766
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,360
Those moves!

767
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,800
Alright, this is the last one.

768
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,180
Alright, this is the last one.

769
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,160
You got this, you got this.

770
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,340
I couldn't think you would do it for me!

771
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,620
Oh god, oh no.

772
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,400
Oh no.

773
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,540
I'm waiting for you guys.

774
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,100
Knock the fuck out.

775
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,480
Oh, oh, she needs help, do you need help?

776
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,340
Oh, I got it, I got it!

777
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,380
Good, good, good.

778
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,260
I got it, I got it!

779
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,800
Oh, they're fucking...

780
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,080
They're harassing me!

781
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:18,620
We won!

782
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,100
Oh my god, three people can't stop me!

783
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,160
That was four people.

784
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,420
Oh shit, you're right.

785
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,840
Who needs to scrim?

786
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,540
We're just naturally talented.

787
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,020
Oh shit.

788
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,860
I'm out.

789
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,200
I can't even, oh wait!

790
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,080
No, let me in the photo, I'm a winner!

791
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,320
I'm a winner!

792
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:47,640
Yay!

793
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,160
Is that automatically a win for us?

794
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,320
We don't have to play the third round, right?

795
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:58,540
Yeah, we won.

796
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,340
What a speed run.

797
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:09,920
Alright, round two is luggage, chaos, soccer, and winter is coming.

798
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,820
What's luggage chaos?

799
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:18,020
Luggage chaos is the same thing as the candy one, only you have to put the luggage on conveyor belts, and then they slowly go into a separate area.

800
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:25,280
That luggage, like, you can't drag the luggage into that area, you have to, like, parkour into it, and then you grab the luggage off the conveyor belts.

801
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:28,640
And then you put it in, like, the candy, and you just dump it down with the lever.

802
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,580
Oh, okay, so it's just the lever stuff again.

803
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,840
Yeah, it's just, like, slightly confusing.

804
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:40,720
Like, you can't just walk it to the dumping place, you have to put it on the conveyor belt, and then it goes through, like, a little machine, and then you grab it after.

805
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,760
I see, I see.

806
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,700
Okay, so, like, it's the same thing.

807
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:50,480
You two are the punching people, and Ditto and I will just put luggage on the conveyor belt.

808
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:51,800
Sweet.

809
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,380
We're doing it!

810
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,600
I can't believe I'm actually contributing this time.

811
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,240
Oh my god, this is so different from my last Twitch Rivals.

812
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,780
Did you not do well?

813
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,040
I was not contributing.

814
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:18,060
I did not know what I was doing.

815
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,320
I still don't know what I'm doing, but, like, we're winning, so that's all that matters.

816
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:21,760
No, you're winning, though.

817
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,060
Just constantly say that you do.

818
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:24,420
It's fine.

819
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,240
Is this Connor?

820
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,600
As in Connor...

821
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:32,980
His dance.

822
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,540
Yeah, Connor.

823
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,280
Oh my god!

824
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,040
Yes, suck it!

825
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,680
I'm gonna beat you in the Tekken Geek Tournament 2.

826
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,640
Unless he's on my team.

827
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,360
Still do it!

828
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:46,760
Still win!

829
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:48,880
Suck it!

830
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,720
You're gonna lose to me in Tekken 8 as well.

831
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,780
What is this conversation that you're having?

832
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,700
They were asking about their favorite swear words.

833
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,720
Chib asked me about my favorite swear word, and I said, whoa.

834
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,140
Oh, whoa.

835
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,320
What was it?

836
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,600
I thought it was bitch, right?

837
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,100
Your name is in the prologue.

838
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,640
It's appropriate.

839
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,420
I slayed cats.

840
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,040
It's a game about slaying animals.

841
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,580
It's just our team.

842
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,360
You're LARPing.

843
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,560
He likes Glorp.

844
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,840
Oh my god, he loves Glorp, too!

845
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,260
I play Destiny, too.

846
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,780
How do you chat?

847
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,100
Oh, you enter.

848
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,680
Just press enter.

849
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:50,830
What do you mean, no I don't?

850
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:51,830
I play Destiny, too!

851
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:53,930
I don't.

852
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:58,030
If the streams are deleted, doesn't mean it never existed.

853
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,950
Did you stream it on Tuesdays?

854
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,090
I'm pretty sure that's a special day.

855
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,490
Oh yeah, that's a special Tuesday.

856
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,130
Every Tuesday.

857
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,490
Sunday is the only sacred day.

858
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:15,570
Why is Sunday a sacred day?

859
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,870
Because I don't play Overwatch.

860
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,990
That's a variety day.

861
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:25,590
Wait, I thought Tuesday is a variety day.

862
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:26,850
What the fuck is Tuesday?

863
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:27,910
That's Wednesday.

864
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,150
Wednesday and Sunday.

865
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,110
Wait, then what's Tuesday?

866
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:35,390
We don't talk about it.

867
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:36,190
What's Tuesday?

868
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,490
Then is it Overwatch?

869
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:41,170
Do you stream Overwatch with your Vtuber?

870
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:42,950
No.

871
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,570
Then what the fuck is Tuesday?

872
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,810
Tuesday was whatever I want it be.

873
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:51,770
It's whatever I wanted it to be.

874
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:53,730
It's whatever I wanted it to be.

875
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,550
Valid, valid, valid.

876
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:57,490
I'm valid.

877
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:58,810
You're valid.

878
00:31:59,030 --> 00:31:59,950
That's right, you are.

879
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,930
Okay, we finished it so fast.

880
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,830
That we have to wait for the other games to be done.

881
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:06,670
We're just that good.

882
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,590
We're so good at this game.

883
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:12,510
Until we face the Apex team that's in this.

884
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,610
Wait, which team is that?

885
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:15,630
I don't know.

886
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,030
That is team...

887
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:19,950
It's Rogue's team.

888
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,110
Team 6.

889
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:23,070
That's the Apex team.

890
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,150
No, I think we can go against them.

891
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,770
I mean, these are basically training rounds, you know?

892
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:31,650
Yeah, but it's gonna determine our seeding.

893
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:32,890
Oh.

894
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:33,570
Yeah.

895
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,410
So, it's like the seeded matches.

896
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,510
Oh my god, seeds.

897
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:39,730
Wow.

898
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:40,890
Oh my god.

899
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,250
Ditto, are you awake, Ditto?

900
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:45,810
Yeah.

901
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:48,350
He's not dead inside.

902
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,470
Ditto's just chillin'.

903
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,610
He's vibing at 4 in the morning.

904
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:59,010
I haven't slept yet.

905
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,190
Oh my god.

906
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:01,670
Yeah, I was so excited.

907
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,210
We're playing Honkai Stars.

908
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:06,270
Yeah, I just finished the main story.

909
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:07,730
Oh, shit.

910
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,930
I was like, they had a concert and stuff too.

911
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,930
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

912
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14,270
Yeah.

913
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:17,390
It took me like 10 hours to finish the main story.

914
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,350
10 hours?

915
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:19,370
Yeah, yesterday.

916
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:20,950
Yeah, 10 hours.

917
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:23,130
Wait, how long have you been playing Honkai?

918
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:24,270
Wait, how long have you been playing Honkai?

919
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:25,810
Um...

920
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:26,430
Yesterday?

921
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:28,790
Did you start yesterday?

922
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:30,010
No.

923
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:32,330
Maybe one month?

924
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,230
One month ago.

925
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:37,010
So it took like one month of like 5 plus hours of...

926
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:43,750
I started playing this game on the first day and I stopped playing it and I just came back.

927
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:44,050
Oh my god.

928
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,470
How much money did you spend?

929
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,270
Um...

930
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,190
We don't count it.

931
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:55,350
It doesn't matter how much you spend the money on this game.

932
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,730
It doesn't matter?

933
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:57,990
Yeah.

934
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:01,810
If it doesn't matter, then you would tell me how much you spend, right?

935
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,930
It doesn't matter if you have fun or not.

936
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,690
Oh, yeah, okay.

937
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:07,610
Yeah.

938
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:11,410
So if it doesn't matter how much you spend, then you should be open to telling me how much you spend.

939
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:13,550
I can't remember.

940
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:15,450
You can't remember?

941
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,010
I can't remember.

942
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:22,730
Okay.

943
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:23,370
No, I agree.

944
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:25,710
I think you should actually celebrate finishing it.

945
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,570
Wait, wait, wait.

946
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:33,010
How many characters do you have on Honkai?

947
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:37,110
It's not that much because I just came back.

948
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:41,170
Maybe...

949
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:45,150
Let me shake.

950
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:48,770
Let me open up Honkai real quick.

951
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,890
Let me shake.

952
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,690
Wait, how many characters does Honkai even have?

953
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:58,190
I have 37 characters.

954
00:34:58,610 --> 00:34:59,550
Wait, out of how many?

955
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,150
Are you missing any characters?

956
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:05,850
Out of 37.

957
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,630
Out of 37?

958
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,630
Wait, how do you know?

959
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:14,090
I don't know anything about Honkai Star Rail.

960
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:15,910
Wait, do you even gotcha?

961
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,230
All I know is a lot of people...

962
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,810
I only play gotcha games with PvP.

963
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,070
Yeah, like what?

964
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:25,570
Well, the last one I played was AFK Arena.

965
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,490
AFK Arena?

966
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:30,710
Isn't that like a fucking YouTube ad sponsor game?

967
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,090
Yeah, I was gonna say.

968
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:32,970
I see it everywhere.

969
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,290
I see it all on TikTok.

970
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:36,730
I played that shit like seven years ago.

971
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,750
Wait, is that old?

972
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,810
It's existed for that long?

973
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,950
It's 2018, holy shit.

974
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,910
I haven't played a gotcha game in a while.

975
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:48,810
The last gotcha game I played was like Genshin because I was like hella bored.

976
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,170
How do you think about Genshin?

977
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,630
Did you like it or did you stop because it was boring?

978
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:53,890
Yeah.

979
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,610
They made Gonsai.

980
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:55,790
Gonyu.

981
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,390
So they got that going for me.

982
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:58,350
That's fair.

983
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,610
They got Gonyu.

984
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:03,150
Listen, gotcha games...

985
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:10,590
I only play gotcha games for PvP because like the whole point of gotcha games is supposed to be like buying Gucci wallets but for like weebs.

986
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:11,490
Yeah.

987
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:14,570
PvP roster.

988
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,830
I'm surprised you haven't tried out Nikkei.

989
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,130
Why the fuck would I play Nikkei?

990
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:25,450
Because it's FPS.

991
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:28,810
If I wanted to look at anime girl ass I would look at something else.

992
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,530
Like what?

993
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,370
Like what then?

994
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:34,650
Yeah?

995
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:36,530
Yeah.

996
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,050
What do you say?

997
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,350
I think that's self-explanatory.

998
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,630
You know what that is?

999
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:42,490
That's a pintai.

1000
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,030
I can't

1001
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:52,890
play no gotcha game for that.

1002
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,290
That's not cool.

1003
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,010
Alright chat.

1004
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:00,830
Rate his taste.

1005
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:01,770
Is it...

1006
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:09,470
Do you have any recommendations?

1007
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:11,510
Do you have any recommendations?

1008
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:14,490
Now there's some good ones but I'm not going to say them out loud.

1009
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,030
That's TOS.

1010
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:17,990
Oh yeah.

1011
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,030
Pushing Slayer.

1012
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,630
Pushing Slayer isn't TOS.

1013
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:27,570
Yeah but you say it out loud on Twitch instead of writing it down.

1014
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,050
Is it...

1015
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:29,090
really bannable?

1016
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:30,450
Yeah.

1017
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:31,890
Well pay for your gotcha games for that.

1018
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,550
They're similar.

1019
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:37,610
Why would I pay for it when it's free on the internet?

1020
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,510
That's true.

1021
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,570
It's for the experience.

1022
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:47,650
Hell no.

1023
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:50,510
I want it to be a competition okay?

1024
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,350
Hell no.

1025
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,170
You can make it competitive.

1026
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,070
It's like...

1027
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:03,990
It's competitive.

1028
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:04,990
Chat can find a way.

1029
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,210
Your chat can find a way.

1030
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:07,470
Not my chat.

1031
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,390
My chat is say-so.

1032
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:10,170
Christian friendly.

1033
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:11,830
Oh okay.

1034
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:13,290
Mine is full of intellectuals.

1035
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,790
Are you dying?

1036
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:18,170
You okay?

1037
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:19,470
I'm sorry.

1038
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:24,170
After hearing you say your chat is filled with intellectuals I couldn't take you seriously anymore.

1039
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,410
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

1040
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:30,750
What the hell is

1041
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:34,430
that supposed to mean?

1042
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:34,990
Wait.

1043
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:37,730
We have to ignore the bracket.

1044
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:39,850
A mistake was made reporting a match.

1045
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:40,910
Oh wait.

1046
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,110
What's going on?

1047
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:45,010
I don't even know what the bracket is.

1048
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,010
Whose bracket is it?

1049
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:47,930
Whose bracket is it?

1050
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,650
I mean they can't really make a mistake with ours.

1051
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:54,550
Cause we just did something.

1052
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,450
Ours was so clear cut.

1053
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:57,670
Yeah.

1054
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:01,730
You said your chat is like say-so.

1055
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:03,250
Isn't that the whole thing like not...

1056
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,410
Is say-so like not lewd?

1057
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:05,890
Yeah.

1058
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:07,830
Hey listen.

1059
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:12,950
Anyone that says say-so It's like the Christianity of VTubing.

1060
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,990
They're like closeted freaks.

1061
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:15,830
Woah!

1062
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:18,090
What is that supposed to mean?

1063
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:21,070
It's like Christian girls, you know?

1064
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:21,910
They're like freaks.

1065
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:22,690
Woah!

1066
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:25,870
Woah!

1067
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:29,250
They promised their bodies to God.

1068
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:31,010
Yeah.

1069
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:34,910
And then they threw that away once they got a taste of the forbidden fruit.

1070
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:41,310
Feels like you're speaking from experience.

1071
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:43,930
Experience?

1072
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:48,010
Oh my god.

1073
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,710
When is our fucking...

1074
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,790
When is our next bracket gonna start?

1075
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:53,730
We did too good.

1076
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:56,750
We won too quickly.

1077
00:39:58,610 --> 00:39:59,670
We're just too good.

1078
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,670
Next time I'll try to play worse.

1079
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:02,090
No, no, no.

1080
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:03,450
We gotta be faster next time.

1081
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,050
I get it.

1082
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:08,090
Next time we gotta be even faster.

1083
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:11,670
We watched you walk into their goal in the first five seconds.

1084
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:12,990
I don't think we can be faster.

1085
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:15,130
They just couldn't register.

1086
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,310
They couldn't register what I did there.

1087
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:32,110
Oh, I like the fact that we have Pussy Slayer on the team so that as we do better and better, we just have to constantly pay attention to the first Pussy Slayer as they talk about it.

1088
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,530
I thrive on that.

1089
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:34,630
Good.

1090
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:39,670
I got AFK kicked from the lobby.

1091
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:40,470
Yeah.

1092
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,310
I almost got AFK kicked as well.

1093
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:45,090
I'm gonna use this time in a runescape actually.

1094
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,190
Wait, what are you grinding for?

1095
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:52,970
I'm getting my Warp Scepter right now so then I can clear barrows more efficiently.

1096
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,030
Wait, what skill is that?

1097
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:02,210
Well, Warp Scepter is for magic and then barrows is for barrows gear.

1098
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,710
So you're trying to get better gear right now?

1099
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:07,170
Yeah.

1100
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:09,210
I'm getting mid gear for my Iron Man.

1101
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,410
Oh, you're Iron Man-ing!

1102
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:11,850
Oh.

1103
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:14,350
That makes sense.

1104
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,110
Oh my god.

1105
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:20,330
He's multitasking just like a true Overwatch player while waiting in queue.

1106
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,630
He's EXP maxing.

1107
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:30,530
I forgot about how long it takes in between matches.

1108
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:35,870
Yeah, that's why you have to start saying like, start making jokes or something.

1109
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,990
Oh yeah, help you with your commentary.

1110
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:40,370
Yeah.

1111
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:42,790
Help entertain your chat.

1112
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:44,890
Brie, entertain my chat for me.

1113
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,610
My chat's like sludge.

1114
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:52,730
Yeah, be funny for my chat, Brie.

1115
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,770
This is your purpose now.

1116
00:41:59,070 --> 00:41:59,750
What?

1117
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:00,330
What?

1118
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,910
What was the pirate's favorite letter?

1119
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:05,210
R.

1120
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:08,870
No, it's the C's, stupid!

1121
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:14,190
You just call me stupid?

1122
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:14,730
What the?

1123
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:19,570
If you think you're so smart, what's 25 plus 25?

1124
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:21,450
Uh, 72.

1125
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:22,570
That's not...

1126
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,190
What?

1127
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:25,450
It's not 72.

1128
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:27,450
I said so confidently.

1129
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,630
Why is it 72?

1130
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:31,390
I don't know!

1131
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:32,630
I don't know!

1132
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:35,290
Where did the 72 come from?

1133
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:37,310
I don't know!

1134
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:39,890
Everything's falling apart.

1135
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,430
Everything, oh no.

1136
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:43,170
Our momentum is gone!

1137
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,670
We lost our momentum!

1138
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:46,330
No!

1139
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:48,350
You were kicked!

1140
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:49,410
Wait, we got kicked out.

1141
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:50,790
That means they're making the room, right?

1142
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:53,310
No, you got AFK kicked, maybe.

1143
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:54,930
No, no, they removed us.

1144
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:55,170
No, I didn't!

1145
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:55,470
They did!

1146
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:55,730
They did!

1147
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:56,670
Yeah, they moved us.

1148
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:59,030
We're fighting... Wait, the action just kicked?

1149
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:01,870
We're fighting Kendomerth now.

1150
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:04,430
What did?

1151
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:06,850
Yeah!

1152
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:07,370
Finally!

1153
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:08,810
Get off RuneScape!

1154
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:09,890
Aw, yippee!

1155
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:13,290
Get off RuneScape right now!

1156
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:16,410
I'm getting to my tortoises and then I'll get off.

1157
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:17,730
I'm almost there.

1158
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:19,350
Let's see...

1159
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:26,510
Typing in the Twitch Rivals and then Twitch Rivals.

1160
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:27,650
The Twitch Rivals.

1161
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:31,850
It's not showing up.

1162
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:33,510
It showed up for me.

1163
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,010
I spelled it wrong.

1164
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:35,370
I just copied and pasted.

1165
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:37,270
That's actually good.

1166
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:39,150
I don't know why I'm typing them manually.

1167
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:40,130
Ditto.

1168
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:41,590
Okay.

1169
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:44,270
Okay.

1170
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:46,690
I wonder if they won their last one.

1171
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:50,110
Guys, did the Kendomerth team win their last round?

1172
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:51,550
Stream snipe for me right now.

1173
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:52,870
But like...

1174
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:54,670
But not like unethically.

1175
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:57,790
Unethically?

1176
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:01,930
Ethically stream snipe to just tell me if they won their last game.

1177
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:02,890
They did!

1178
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:03,770
Wait, they did!

1179
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:04,350
They're gamers!

1180
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:07,570
They won their last match.

1181
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:08,810
So they might be gamers.

1182
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:11,830
Where the fuck is Pussyslayer?

1183
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:12,990
Oh yeah, he's still walking over.

1184
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:14,950
Pussyslayer alive.

1185
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:18,750
The last man there.

1186
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:23,890
Yeah, stream snipe respectfully, guys.

1187
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:29,730
Alright.

1188
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:32,330
Kendomerth.

1189
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:34,010
They're here to...

1190
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:37,290
Did you guys win your last match?

1191
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:41,010
Did you guys win your last match?

1192
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:42,390
Did you guys win your last match?

1193
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:43,130
Did you guys win your last match?

1194
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:44,310
Oh, they did.

1195
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:45,270
They did?

1196
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:46,450
I know, I just wanted them to...

1197
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:47,850
I just wanted them to respond.

1198
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:50,210
I know they did, so I want to see if they lied to me.

1199
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:52,570
Oh no, I asked them immediately.

1200
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:54,130
Okay.

1201
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:55,970
We did it.

1202
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:57,650
We're bad.

1203
00:44:58,310 --> 00:44:59,750
It's okay, we're making...

1204
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:04,090
We're gonna make them think that we're really bad so they go easy on us.

1205
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:06,210
That's a good idea.

1206
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:06,770
Yeah, yeah.

1207
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:09,730
We got too old.

1208
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:22,670
Okay, we got it.

1209
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:24,630
We have to make them underestimate us.

1210
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:29,930
Make them pity us so that we can do better.

1211
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:30,490
Pussyslayer was a...

1212
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:32,630
was a huge...

1213
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:43,610
It's okay, we can do this, guys.

1214
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:46,350
We can do this.

1215
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:49,430
What the fuck is this?

1216
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:50,550
That's the...

1217
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:51,590
I haven't played this one before.

1218
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:57,690
Put the luggage on the conveyor belt in the middle and then it goes under those little...

1219
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:59,890
like a little platform.

1220
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:01,410
Yeah, you guys have to beat them out.

1221
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:01,970
And then you have to bring it into the room.

1222
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:02,850
Yeah.

1223
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:03,970
Yeah.

1224
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:04,090
Yeah.

1225
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:04,170
Yeah.

1226
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:06,730
You and Tia are gonna beat them up as usual.

1227
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:08,890
I'm just gonna beat the shit out of them.

1228
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:09,350
Yeah.

1229
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:16,970
They can go and take things from the conveyor belt in both the hub area and then our separate little area where we score points.

1230
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:19,770
We gotta just keep it on.

1231
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:20,510
Okay.

1232
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:23,190
We'll figure this out, right?

1233
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:24,950
We're gonna figure this out.

1234
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:26,330
Yeah, I believe in you guys.

1235
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:27,390
I'm just gonna punch shit.

1236
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:28,790
Thank you.

1237
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:30,450
That works, honestly.

1238
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:33,290
Wait, there's a golden case.

1239
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:34,870
Yeah, it's worth a lot.

1240
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:36,770
Somebody grab the golden case.

1241
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:38,070
Oh!

1242
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:41,070
No, he got it!

1243
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:43,370
Wait, he just ran into the thing.

1244
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:44,450
I'm going into their spawn.

1245
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:46,330
Are we red?

1246
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:47,630
Are we red?

1247
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:50,190
Okay, I'm going to red.

1248
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:50,730
I'm going to red.

1249
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:52,450
Guys, they're all pulling me!

1250
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:54,330
I can't even bring the luggage over!

1251
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:56,850
They're pulling me!

1252
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:57,990
I'm out.

1253
00:46:58,310 --> 00:46:59,490
Guys, they're really good.

1254
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:00,750
The gold briefcase is stuck.

1255
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:02,690
I'm stuck under it.

1256
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:03,870
Wait, no!

1257
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:04,790
We lost Mandon!

1258
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,430
I can't roll!

1259
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:08,570
How do I get over?

1260
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:10,370
Guys, how do I...

1261
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:11,630
Wait, it's actually just stuck.

1262
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:14,830
How do I get over this?

1263
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:15,410
Oh, thank you!

1264
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:16,790
Guys, how do I...

1265
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:20,870
How do we get over...

1266
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:21,550
Guys, I don't...

1267
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:26,030
You can't get over if you have a suitcase in your hand.

1268
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:26,290
Oh!

1269
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:27,150
Wait, then...

1270
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:29,790
You have to put it on the conveyor belt.

1271
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:31,190
Oh!

1272
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:32,390
Guys, I think they're winning.

1273
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,030
Yeah, they are.

1274
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:36,750
No, I'm spawn camping them.

1275
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:37,170
We're good.

1276
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:39,190
They were so confused about this game mode.

1277
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:40,790
Okay.

1278
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:41,730
I need help.

1279
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:43,130
They're harassing me.

1280
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:44,790
They're picking me up.

1281
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:45,650
I can't get off.

1282
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:48,630
This isn't going well.

1283
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:51,530
Wait, we have too many people on their side.

1284
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:52,270
You're taking it away from them!

1285
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:54,270
You're taking it away from the goal!

1286
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:55,430
Wait, I am.

1287
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:58,410
Put it here and then put it under there.

1288
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:01,490
I figured it out.

1289
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:03,650
It's fine.

1290
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:04,390
We can catch up.

1291
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:08,330
I don't know if they're harassing me right now.

1292
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:10,490
We can catch up.

1293
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:10,490
It's fine.

1294
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:11,690
Guys, they are putting a lot...

1295
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:11,690
I'm here.

1296
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:11,950
I'm here.

1297
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:13,810
They are putting a lot on my end.

1298
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:16,770
I figured out how to do this, but these guys are actually dead.

1299
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:17,790
Okay, if you just hold it...

1300
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:19,630
I can't.

1301
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:20,750
I'm dead.

1302
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:22,650
No!

1303
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:25,910
They have a goal!

1304
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:27,930
They actually know what to do.

1305
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:28,950
No, you grabbed me!

1306
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:29,750
Oh my god.

1307
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:30,890
It's okay.

1308
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:31,970
I grabbed the keys though.

1309
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:33,290
It's okay.

1310
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:35,130
Okay.

1311
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:37,130
Go to the lever.

1312
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:38,110
Go to the lever.

1313
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:38,470
It's fine.

1314
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:38,870
I'm just doing it.

1315
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:41,830
Please,

1316
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:46,370
we're so near.

1317
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:49,030
I said come closer to us.

1318
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:49,810
Why are they beating me?

1319
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:51,070
This isn't going well.

1320
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:53,270
This isn't going well.

1321
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:55,130
Oh, sorry.

1322
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:55,910
Sorry.

1323
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:57,850
That was a bad hit.

1324
00:48:57,850 --> 00:48:58,210
Oh my god.

1325
00:48:58,230 --> 00:48:59,290
This is so hard.

1326
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:00,650
They are so good.

1327
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:02,850
I'm getting one man harassed.

1328
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:04,150
They took my hat.

1329
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:11,710
Guys, this might be...

1330
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:13,370
This might be a team.

1331
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:15,590
This might be a team.

1332
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:16,810
This might be a team.

1333
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:18,910
That might win this.

1334
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:19,210
Oh, take it.

1335
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:19,570
Take it.

1336
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:20,330
I fucked them up.

1337
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:22,610
Oh, help.

1338
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:23,510
Yeah.

1339
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:23,870
Yeah.

1340
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:24,130
I got them.

1341
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:26,750
I dropped it.

1342
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:27,190
We're good.

1343
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:28,690
Oh, shit.

1344
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:29,370
What?

1345
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:30,630
It knocked me out.

1346
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:33,830
Wait.

1347
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,470
There's a taser gun on my end.

1348
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:35,810
Oh, no.

1349
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:39,130
There's a taser gun on my end.

1350
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:40,590
Guys, this might be a GG go next.

1351
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:40,930
Yeah.

1352
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:42,790
Okay.

1353
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:43,630
No.

1354
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:45,190
We got to get a strat down.

1355
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:45,550
It's fine.

1356
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:46,250
This is trial.

1357
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:49,050
This is definitely not our game.

1358
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:52,330
Okay.

1359
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:53,270
The next one.

1360
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:58,210
Guys, they definitely know we're bad now.

1361
00:49:59,270 --> 00:49:59,850
It's okay.

1362
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:01,710
The next one is the soccer game.

1363
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:02,230
Oh, shit.

1364
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:02,750
We can do that.

1365
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:03,590
We can do that.

1366
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:05,510
Okay.

1367
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:07,010
So, I'll beat up the goalie.

1368
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:08,310
That's my job.

1369
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:08,670
Okay.

1370
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:10,050
I'll just beat up the goalie.

1371
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:11,690
And you guys do the other stuff.

1372
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:14,510
That's just not our mode.

1373
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:15,070
All the other stuff.

1374
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:15,950
Yeah.

1375
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:16,970
This wasn't it.

1376
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:17,450
This wasn't it.

1377
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:22,830
Guys, this is not the Apex pro team that scrimmed every day.

1378
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:26,290
Well, these guys have scrimmed.

1379
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:26,930
They know what they're doing.

1380
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:27,530
They have plans.

1381
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:32,570
Maybe the Apex team was scrimming this team, honestly.

1382
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:37,670
Round two.

1383
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:38,410
Fight.

1384
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:39,990
Wait, are we playing a round two?

1385
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:42,590
No, I think we're just... I think we're just waiting.

1386
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:43,850
Yeah, the owner has only the game.

1387
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:48,450
Instructions were definitely unclear for that game.

1388
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:49,710
We can win this one, though.

1389
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:52,210
Oh, they're Minecraft?

1390
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:54,090
That makes so much more sense.

1391
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:56,530
They're what?

1392
00:50:56,830 --> 00:50:57,350
They're so coordinated.

1393
00:50:57,350 --> 00:50:57,830
They're so coordinated.

1394
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:03,270
Minecraft players are the god gamers of minigames.

1395
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:06,350
They're just...

1396
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:07,810
Oh my gosh.

1397
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:12,530
I remember when I did Twitch Rivals in Fortnite and a Minecraft player won like top five or something.

1398
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:13,670
Oh my god.

1399
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:14,190
Yeah.

1400
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:16,150
In the Fortnite fucking tournament.

1401
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:19,050
This one I think we have to headbutt more.

1402
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:21,390
How do we headbutt?

1403
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:22,470
Or like we can headbutt?

1404
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:23,730
I don't know.

1405
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:24,710
Middle mouse button.

1406
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:26,290
Okay, what is middle mouse?

1407
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:27,930
I don't know.

1408
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:29,590
Instructions unclear.

1409
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:33,330
Guys, that's okay.

1410
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:34,830
We can lose like one round.

1411
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:36,770
One matchup.

1412
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:37,230
It's fine.

1413
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:38,270
No, we can't lose.

1414
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:40,870
Otherwise, it'll seem like we're cheating.

1415
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:42,250
We just did the, you know...

1416
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:44,030
It'll make the story better.

1417
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:44,990
That's true.

1418
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:45,490
That's true.

1419
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:47,510
Oh, we're already going.

1420
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:48,570
Oh, this is not good.

1421
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:49,330
Oh, wait, wait.

1422
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:50,350
Two of them are knocked out, though.

1423
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:51,350
Two of them are already knocked out.

1424
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:51,790
I'm gonna go...

1425
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:55,210
I'm going over to beat up the goalie.

1426
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:56,230
Oh, no.

1427
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:56,730
Oh, no.

1428
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:57,870
I got it out.

1429
00:51:57,910 --> 00:51:58,190
It's fine.

1430
00:51:58,330 --> 00:51:58,570
It's okay.

1431
00:51:58,630 --> 00:52:00,410
I'm beating up... The goalie and I are distracted.

1432
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:03,690
Guys, I'm distracting the goalie.

1433
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:05,110
We can't hit each other.

1434
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:06,410
Okay.

1435
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,170
I got ball in midfield.

1436
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:11,110
Guys, I got the goalie out.

1437
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:11,930
I got the goalie out.

1438
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:12,610
The goalie's out.

1439
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:13,550
The goal.

1440
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:14,250
The goalie's back in.

1441
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:15,150
We're trying to get the ball in mid.

1442
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:18,310
Guys, I'm distracting the goalie.

1443
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:19,670
That's good.

1444
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:20,030
That's good.

1445
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:21,570
This goalie is so out now.

1446
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:22,270
We're doing our part.

1447
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:23,630
I'm doing my part.

1448
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:24,530
Get out.

1449
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:25,530
Oh, no.

1450
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,030
I hit the top rim.

1451
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:28,450
The goalie was gone.

1452
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:32,430
Listen, this ball is hard to control sometimes.

1453
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:33,510
Oh, my God.

1454
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:34,790
That was a good hit, too.

1455
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:37,030
I'm really bad at Rocket League.

1456
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:38,050
This is not...

1457
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:39,730
Guys, this is literally a 3v3.

1458
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:43,630
To be fair, this is a 3v3.

1459
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:46,930
The goalie and I, we're toughening it out right now.

1460
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:48,790
Get out, goalie.

1461
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:49,490
We're fine.

1462
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:49,870
We're fine.

1463
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:49,950
We're fine.

1464
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:52,090
Oh, shit.

1465
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:53,150
It's okay.

1466
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:56,030
The goalie and I are having our own slamdown.

1467
00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:57,250
Oh, my God.

1468
00:52:58,170 --> 00:52:59,210
The goalie's out.

1469
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:03,450
I didn't have enough stamina.

1470
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:04,410
I didn't have enough stamina.

1471
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:07,210
I got the goalie away.

1472
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,580
He took away my...

1473
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:13,300
I'm out.

1474
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:13,760
I'm dead.

1475
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,220
This ball is hard to control.

1476
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,020
They're, like, all rolling and stuff.

1477
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:27,900
You have to go faster.

1478
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,060
Yeah, you have to practice.

1479
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,060
I keep forgetting.

1480
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,020
Oh, God.

1481
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:36,660
Oh, I'm out.

1482
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:37,380
Why ball?

1483
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:39,240
I'm out, but don't worry.

1484
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:41,400
I'm gonna get that goalie out, too.

1485
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,100
That's fucking right.

1486
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:44,200
You thought you could have it.

1487
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:44,480
Chill.

1488
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:46,020
That's fucking right.

1489
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,900
How the do you roll in this game?

1490
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,660
I don't know what it is for a controller.

1491
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:52,920
Oh, I figured it out.

1492
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:55,700
Oh, he knocked me out.

1493
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,260
But that's okay.

1494
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,160
I thought he can have it.

1495
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:58,360
Good.

1496
00:53:58,840 --> 00:53:59,860
That's fucking right.

1497
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,820
Get distracted by me.

1498
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:03,380
No!

1499
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:03,800
No!

1500
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,500
What the?

1501
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,320
What the?

1502
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:09,500
I won my game.

1503
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,120
Guys, I think if they score the next one, it's over.

1504
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:16,500
What's going on?

1505
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:17,760
Holy shit!

1506
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,500
What the fuck am I watching?

1507
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:22,100
Toki.

1508
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:22,540
Toki.

1509
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:24,320
Maybe we need another one.

1510
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,740
Maybe we need another player.

1511
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:26,840
I did it.

1512
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:33,300
I can't believe it.

1513
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,380
There you go.

1514
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,140
I did it.

1515
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:41,120
Toki spent the entire game just finding someone in the corner and then instantly won.

1516
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,660
It's just that easy.

1517
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:45,820
What can I say?

1518
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:48,560
It's actually that fucking easy.

1519
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,700
That's fucking right, Rabbit.

1520
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:53,280
You thought I was done with you?

1521
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:55,600
You thought I was done with you?

1522
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,060
The goalie is distracted again.

1523
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,540
The goalie is...

1524
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:05,040
You think I was done with you?

1525
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:05,420
I'm dead.

1526
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:06,320
I'm dead.

1527
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:08,680
I'm coming back.

1528
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:11,920
Don't worry.

1529
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,280
I'm the striker.

1530
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,540
The little bear guy here or the corgi.

1531
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:15,980
He's the one that sets up the combo.

1532
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:17,800
It's fine.

1533
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:18,020
It's fine.

1534
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:18,700
Oh, shit.

1535
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:19,820
Guys, I don't know.

1536
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,440
I'm going to fucking beat up this guy, though.

1537
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:24,840
Oh, no.

1538
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:26,080
No!

1539
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:29,340
I'm rolling as well.

1540
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:30,220
I'm doing their strat.

1541
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:32,820
Okay, I'm waiting for you guys.

1542
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:34,480
No!

1543
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:34,940
Okay.

1544
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:36,920
Oh, no.

1545
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:37,440
Oh, no.

1546
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,380
I'm waiting for the fucking pass.

1547
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:41,520
Oh, no.

1548
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:43,220
You walked in with your body.

1549
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:43,680
Thank you.

1550
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:44,220
No!

1551
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:45,940
Oh, my God.

1552
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:46,440
That's so close.

1553
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:48,240
Okay.

1554
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:50,260
I hit it down.

1555
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:51,020
I hit it down mid.

1556
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:52,440
I'm coming over.

1557
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:53,680
I lost my hat.

1558
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,880
No, I lost my hat.

1559
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:57,400
No, my hat's blocking me.

1560
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:01,060
My hat actually blocked me.

1561
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,800
The one time.

1562
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:07,580
The one time I didn't distract the goalie.

1563
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:08,360
It's okay.

1564
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:11,700
The one time I knew I should never left my post.

1565
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:15,940
You thought you could get away from me.

1566
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,000
You thought you could get away from me.

1567
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:18,620
Okay.

1568
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,520
Okay, she did got away from me.

1569
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:23,060
It's fucking right.

1570
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,460
The goalie's gone.

1571
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:25,220
The goalie's gone.

1572
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,020
The goalie's gone.

1573
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:26,960
Quick.

1574
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:29,120
We need to get the ball over there.

1575
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:31,280
Yes,

1576
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:35,000
nice.

1577
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:35,940
Okay, nice.

1578
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,040
The goalie's there, Doki.

1579
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:40,420
I feel like I have to play defense.

1580
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:40,860
I'm scared.

1581
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:41,280
The goalie's going back up.

1582
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:47,260
I didn't want you guys to go there while I distract the goalie.

1583
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:49,800
The problem is I need to play defense.

1584
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,780
I can't play D and offense at the same time.

1585
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,260
That's what midfield is.

1586
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,940
Midfield is D and offense.

1587
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:59,180
That's the name for midfield.

1588
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,220
If I go...

1589
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:02,660
If I go full offense...

1590
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:06,640
Alright, I'm going on the offense.

1591
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:08,340
Okay.

1592
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:10,380
What the?

1593
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,160
It's back.

1594
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,280
Oh my god.

1595
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,820
You go offense.

1596
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:16,640
I'll do mid.

1597
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:18,660
Okay.

1598
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:20,600
Oh my god.

1599
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,580
Oh my god, I ran out of stamina.

1600
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:29,310
Jumping and kicking into it is very good.

1601
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:29,990
Okay.

1602
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:31,410
Okay.

1603
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:35,650
Wait, I thought you were fucking offense.

1604
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:36,250
What happened?

1605
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:40,770
I'm just trying to do what I think will be the best right now.

1606
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:45,430
Look at that.

1607
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:46,590
Look at that edge.

1608
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:47,670
Yeah, but there's no offense.

1609
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:49,010
There's no offense.

1610
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:53,110
I'm scared.

1611
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:53,510
I'm scared.

1612
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:55,990
If I'm not over there, the ball is going to go into the goal.

1613
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:00,330
Oh, big pass.

1614
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:01,690
There's no offense.

1615
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:03,210
There's no offense.

1616
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:05,250
This is your job.

1617
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:10,550
Yeah, well, unfortunately, I pass in mid.

1618
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:11,070
Oh my god.

1619
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:11,970
Okay.

1620
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:13,150
Okay.

1621
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:13,890
I'm going in.

1622
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:14,370
I'm going out.

1623
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:14,810
Look at that.

1624
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:16,750
Stalker works and the ball is passing.

1625
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:18,990
I thought you were offense.

1626
00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:19,370
Fucking offense.

1627
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:22,610
I can't solo Ronaldo this.

1628
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:25,290
I thought you were Messi.

1629
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:26,190
What happened?

1630
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:28,750
Oh, yeah.

1631
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:30,630
What is this?

1632
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:33,150
I have three on me.

1633
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:37,370
We have a minute.

1634
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:38,690
We have a minute.

1635
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:38,890
We have a minute.

1636
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:40,410
I'm trying.

1637
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:44,230
I got it.

1638
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:44,510
I got it.

1639
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:50,300
Oh my god.

1640
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:51,880
All I'm saying is I would have scored.

1641
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:52,520
Nice block.

1642
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:53,720
Bullshit.

1643
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:55,740
No.

1644
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,340
We definitely lose.

1645
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,520
I did score though.

1646
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,320
I gave us our one point.

1647
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,660
Hey, I set up that score.

1648
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:06,740
I set up that score.

1649
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,660
Oh, you did a good job.

1650
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:08,860
Thank you.

1651
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:11,120
I jump kicked into it at the start.

1652
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,100
It's just so sad.

1653
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:20,920
It's just wasn't for us.

1654
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,940
This was not our round.

1655
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,700
We were against Minecraft players.

1656
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,260
If this was banjo ball, they would have been shit on.

1657
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:27,000
What?

1658
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:30,540
What the fuck is banjo ball?

1659
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,460
It's a Warcraft 3 custom game.

1660
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:38,360
You should set up a Warcraft 3 Twitch Rivals and then invite them back.

1661
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:39,960
I've been saying that.

1662
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:42,260
Wait, why can't you do it?

1663
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,240
I'm not a set up guy.

1664
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:45,560
You're not a set up guy?

1665
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:50,280
Basically, I'm like a side character, main character.

1666
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:51,900
Oh, okay.

1667
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:57,160
But Twitch Rivals is like really easy though to set up.

1668
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:59,260
Because Twitch does most of the work.

1669
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:01,300
Nah.

1670
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,840
Then I would have to message someone.

1671
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:03,780
That's out of my pay grade.

1672
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,580
They come to you.

1673
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:09,900
I'd rather play RuneScape.

1674
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:17,300
Has there ever been a RuneScape Rivals?

1675
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:21,420
They've had like Deadman modes and shit.

1676
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:22,500
What's Deadman mode?

1677
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:31,620
It's like basically where you play RuneScape normally but you have insane XP rates and if you die once you're out of the tournament.

1678
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:34,180
It's basically like a giant battle royale.

1679
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,040
But the entire RuneScape map.

1680
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:37,780
Wait, were you part of it?

1681
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:39,720
Hell no.

1682
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:42,460
I thought you loved RuneScape.

1683
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:44,760
I'm not that autistic.

1684
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,460
But you are on the spectrum though because I remember you took the test.

1685
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:03,740
Hell no.

1686
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:04,480
Yes you did.

1687
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:05,340
You took the test.

1688
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:09,080
Listen, every time I've gone to the psychologist they've said I'm normal.

1689
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:12,200
But you took the test.

1690
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:17,420
Are you saying that an internet test is better?

1691
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:20,420
It was a really good internet test though.

1692
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:23,460
It was like a couple of pages long.

1693
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:26,840
It was like a couple of pages long.

1694
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:31,940
They were trying to make me take the test and I was like I'm scared of knowing what I am.

1695
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,500
I feel like being great.

1696
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,440
It said I might be.

1697
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:36,620
Oh.

1698
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,380
Wait, do you remember the number?

1699
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:41,800
There's a different...

1700
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:47,980
In one Discord I'm in we make sure everyone takes the test and then we put the number beside their name of the test.

1701
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,040
That's really funny.

1702
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:50,520
What's the number?

1703
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:55,680
I was a 28 but if I answer the question like I'm able to imagine things, I was a 6.

1704
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:57,960
What does that mean?

1705
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:00,160
I can't imagine things.

1706
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:00,940
I was an amputation.

1707
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,100
Yeah, amputation.

1708
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:07,340
I was a 169.

1709
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:09,720
I think it's a different test.

1710
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:10,880
I don't think it went that high.

1711
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,820
Higher is more autism.

1712
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:20,820
More flavor.

1713
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:23,400
More flavor?

1714
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:25,620
Yeah.

1715
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:32,240
Just a more... I guess like a more more delicious type.

1716
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:33,560
Yeah.

1717
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,480
That's... yeah.

1718
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:37,660
Autism is tasty.

1719
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,080
Yummy.

1720
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:44,740
Apparently there's one more game they have to wait to finish.

1721
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:46,380
And then...

1722
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:48,480
That we weren't the slowest?

1723
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,560
That was like the world's longest match.

1724
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:52,220
That was the longest soccer match ever.

1725
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,300
It wasn't that long.

1726
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:56,340
Actually, to be fair, we did lose really quickly.

1727
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:57,840
And then the last one was just long.

1728
01:02:58,100 --> 01:02:59,680
Okay, the luggage one was... yeah.

1729
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,500
That was a disaster.

1730
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:03,220
The luggage one was...

1731
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:07,860
I accidentally took some of our briefcases to the end.

1732
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,960
I was confused!

1733
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:20,380
The instructions were so unclear!

1734
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:20,740
Clear!

1735
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:24,940
You'll get it next time.

1736
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:26,220
It's okay.

1737
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:27,580
If they put that in that...

1738
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:29,800
If they put another round of that in there...

1739
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:31,060
It'll be easy.

1740
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,040
We'll know what we do.

1741
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,040
We have a system.

1742
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:35,740
We'll be...

1743
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:38,480
We're gonna be so ready for the next round.

1744
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:40,800
I'm almost ready.

1745
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,540
What is the third game?

1746
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:47,900
The third round is team score into the game?

1747
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:49,020
What's into the game?

1748
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:50,360
Oh, is that the arcade?

1749
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:55,900
No, we're doing... we're doing Winter is Coming.

1750
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:57,380
No, that's the...

1751
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:58,400
That's round two.

1752
01:03:59,200 --> 01:03:59,720
Oh.

1753
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:01,700
Are we still on round...

1754
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:02,360
Oh, wait, no.

1755
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:03,020
We're on round three.

1756
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,160
We lost two.

1757
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:05,780
Into the game.

1758
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:07,880
Am I allowed to Google it?

1759
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:10,120
That's the arcade one.

1760
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,020
Yeah, the arcade.

1761
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:15,440
Oh my god!

1762
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:19,820
That's dedicated and going into the game.

1763
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:20,620
I can do that.

1764
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:21,480
I can do that.

1765
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:30,020
We can also... I found out that if you take their arcade machine, you can go to the bombs yourself and make them lose scores.

1766
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:30,380
Oh!

1767
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:34,240
Yeah, but I feel like that's a waste because then you're just gonna get punched out.

1768
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:35,420
That's true.

1769
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:37,720
Or do you still get the shield when you go into this?

1770
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:38,840
Yeah, you get the shield though.

1771
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:42,300
So it's worth the risk to make them lose points.

1772
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:43,460
Yeah, and you're wasting time.

1773
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:44,260
Yeah.

1774
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,460
If you knock them out, you go to...

1775
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:50,020
Oh, Team Doki, feel free to leave the lobby.

1776
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:50,960
Oh, they want us to leave, okay.

1777
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:52,480
Why do we have to leave?

1778
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:53,740
Because we're the freaking losers.

1779
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:56,080
We're the losers.

1780
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:58,740
We have to leave.

1781
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:00,480
For every winner, there is a loser.

1782
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:03,760
I thought we were gonna win!

1783
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:05,100
Um...

1784
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,240
I thought...

1785
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:09,480
Oh my gosh.

1786
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:14,740
You know like, when they did the year of the Luigi, Nintendo ended up losing so much money for that.

1787
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:16,840
So they never give Luigi anything ever again.

1788
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:17,740
Really?

1789
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:18,260
Yeah.

1790
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:20,440
It was like their worst financial year.

1791
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:21,520
Ever.

1792
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:24,500
That's the damn problem with these corpos.

1793
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:28,300
They just look at the finances, and not the lives for other characters.

1794
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:32,680
Their goddamn shareholders and stockholders got them by the britches.

1795
01:05:38,110 --> 01:05:39,770
It's not about the money!

1796
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:42,210
Luigi didn't deserve this!

1797
01:05:42,830 --> 01:05:44,190
I got my love scepter!

1798
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:49,580
Oh yeah!

1799
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:50,280
High five Rush!

1800
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:51,500
That was so sad.

1801
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,300
High five Rush!

1802
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,020
The company closed down.

1803
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:56,840
I'll remember you always.

1804
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:59,300
How the hell do I charge this thing?

1805
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:00,720
Charge what?

1806
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,160
My Warp Scepter that I got.

1807
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:03,920
No!

1808
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:04,580
Yeah.

1809
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,860
I'm XP maxing right now.

1810
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:10,520
Wait, that's true.

1811
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:11,680
I should go do my dailies.

1812
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,360
Wait, not on RuneScape, but...

1813
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:13,760
Yeah.

1814
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:15,680
Are you doing your dailies?

1815
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,500
Did you do your Honkai...

1816
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:18,640
Honkai dailies?

1817
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:20,040
Yeah.

1818
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:23,760
I'm doing it right now.

1819
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,360
You're doing it right now?

1820
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:25,720
See?

1821
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,640
We're all XP maxing right now.

1822
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:32,060
Am I the only one just relaxing, just chilling?

1823
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:37,880
I have the ability to multitask, so...

1824
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:39,120
That's a lie.

1825
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:40,960
Multitasking is a real...

1826
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:42,800
I'm literally doing it right now.

1827
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:45,020
I'm talking, I'm streaming, I'm RuneScaping.

1828
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,460
You're like using less of your...

1829
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:47,780
I'm looking at Twitter.

1830
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:49,160
I'm alt-tabbing.

1831
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:54,000
Yeah, but then you're putting like 20% of effort on each of it.

1832
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:56,800
So you're not putting 100% effort.

1833
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,480
Yeah, but RuneScape is very AFK-able.

1834
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:03,440
Yeah, but then you're doing all these other stuff too at once.

1835
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,700
So you're splitting your mind.

1836
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:08,580
You're splitting your mind?

1837
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:10,040
You're splitting your mind.

1838
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,960
So it's not like actual min-maxing.

1839
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:15,500
You're min...

1840
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:16,460
You're min-minning.

1841
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:18,740
No, I'm max-minning.

1842
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:19,700
Oh, we got it.

1843
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:20,180
Okay, wait.

1844
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:23,400
Oh yeah, the lobby's up by the way.

1845
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:25,460
Did this team win their last game?

1846
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:29,440
Did Job Bartolozzi won their last game, chat?

1847
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,540
Wait, Job was a baller?

1848
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:37,560
That's the TikToker.

1849
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:40,140
He's a TikToker?

1850
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:40,720
Who's he?

1851
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:41,920
He's a TikToker.

1852
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:43,460
Wait, what does...

1853
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:45,320
What TikTok does he do?

1854
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:46,940
He screams.

1855
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:47,820
He screams?

1856
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:50,320
Wait, how many followers does he have?

1857
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,060
A lot.

1858
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:53,780
Yeah, I think a lot.

1859
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:56,100
Is he an actual real guy?

1860
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:56,820
Oh my god.

1861
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:57,700
He is a real guy.

1862
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,760
Holy shit, he has 24 million followers?

1863
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:07,800
What the fuck does he do?

1864
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:09,960
Oh my god, what is TikTok like?

1865
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:12,160
He screams.

1866
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:12,420
He screams.

1867
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:14,300
Yeah, that's it.

1868
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:18,340
That's good to know.

1869
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:20,880
Alright, I'm gonna watch this.

1870
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:22,220
I'm actually curious.

1871
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:23,520
What is this TikTok like?

1872
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:31,100
Oh, he's a reactor!

1873
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:33,700
Yeah, he screams.

1874
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:34,680
That's it?

1875
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,120
That's how he reacts?

1876
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:38,300
Wait, where's my 24 million followers?

1877
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:39,440
I scream all the time.

1878
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,080
We won 2-0.

1879
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:42,320
No, we lost.

1880
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:44,240
We lost.

1881
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:47,000
Oh, that's very bad.

1882
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:53,520
Bunny, you lost me.

1883
01:08:53,780 --> 01:08:55,620
Oh, I did invite you.

1884
01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:56,760
I'll do my union.

1885
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:05,680
Sorry to break it to you, bucko.

1886
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:09,840
Bro, he's a party animal streamer.

1887
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:11,720
That is... I'm sorry.

1888
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,080
He's a party animal streamer.

1889
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:15,540
Sorry that you have to do that.

1890
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:33,660
He tells me to win if you get kicked off.

1891
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:34,360
Wait.

1892
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:46,440
Wait.

1893
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:46,840
Wait, what?

1894
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:51,900
What do you mean?

1895
01:09:57,780 --> 01:09:58,160
Like...

1896
01:10:04,690 --> 01:10:05,070
Alright.

1897
01:10:05,770 --> 01:10:06,430
We're ready.

1898
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:07,950
Alright, into the game.

1899
01:10:08,210 --> 01:10:09,970
Okay, I'll work on doing...

1900
01:10:09,970 --> 01:10:12,070
Wait, who's defending and who's...

1901
01:10:12,070 --> 01:10:13,090
I'm just gonna beat the shit out of them.

1902
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:17,070
Okay, but are you defending beating the shit out of them or offense beating the shit out of them?

1903
01:10:17,230 --> 01:10:17,610
Offense.

1904
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:18,210
Offense?

1905
01:10:18,210 --> 01:10:21,230
Okay, I'll go with short for it and then Bree and Ditto go defense.

1906
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:22,790
Okay.

1907
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:24,710
I'll focus on Arcane.

1908
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:27,470
Alright, we got this.

1909
01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:28,650
Arcane?

1910
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:30,030
League of Legends?

1911
01:10:30,210 --> 01:10:32,610
Oh, the misery.

1912
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:35,250
Everybody wants to be my enemy.

1913
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:37,810
Are we ready?

1914
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:41,470
I don't know if I wrote ready yet.

1915
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:44,570
Okay.

1916
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:46,670
Apparently, they lost their last game too.

1917
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:49,110
Whoever loses this one is the biggest loser.

1918
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:50,370
Yeah.

1919
01:10:50,850 --> 01:10:54,310
Guys, I don't know if I can handle losing again.

1920
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:55,370
Obviously.

1921
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:58,390
What will happen if you lose short for it?

1922
01:10:58,430 --> 01:10:58,990
What will you do?

1923
01:10:59,310 --> 01:11:00,350
The night sky gets angry.

1924
01:11:00,570 --> 01:11:01,810
Even the devil shudders.

1925
01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:11,570
Guys, we don't want short for to lose again.

1926
01:11:11,830 --> 01:11:14,590
We don't know what he's gonna be like after.

1927
01:11:16,090 --> 01:11:19,250
We don't know what he's gonna be like after.

1928
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:20,910
Yes, because we're one to one.

1929
01:11:20,990 --> 01:11:22,830
Wait, that means there's a team that lost every game.

1930
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:24,350
What?

1931
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:26,690
That's not us, though, because we had our one.

1932
01:11:27,490 --> 01:11:28,310
We're ready.

1933
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:31,930
Maybe it was the people that we went against the first time.

1934
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:35,010
And maybe they were just not good at the game.

1935
01:11:35,150 --> 01:11:36,390
And we got false help.

1936
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:38,030
Look.

1937
01:11:39,010 --> 01:11:42,750
This team is a bunch of TikTokers.

1938
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:43,730
Actually, I don't know.

1939
01:11:44,290 --> 01:11:46,070
Yeah, I only know one TikToker.

1940
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:47,650
We're just a bunch of YouTubers.

1941
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:49,450
I'm not.

1942
01:11:49,670 --> 01:11:50,410
I'm normal.

1943
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:51,850
Sure you are.

1944
01:11:58,590 --> 01:12:00,710
Ah, this one is so hard.

1945
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:02,570
Yeah, your defense.

1946
01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:04,130
Okay.

1947
01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:09,130
Alright, here we go.

1948
01:12:09,190 --> 01:12:09,810
We got this.

1949
01:12:10,090 --> 01:12:11,170
Alright, it's fine.

1950
01:12:11,270 --> 01:12:12,350
I will beat everyone up.

1951
01:12:12,350 --> 01:12:14,930
Wait, one of them is an actual Minecraft player on Joe's team?

1952
01:12:15,310 --> 01:12:15,790
What?

1953
01:12:16,330 --> 01:12:16,930
It's over.

1954
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:18,890
They have a minecrafter.

1955
01:12:20,710 --> 01:12:20,790
It's over.

1956
01:12:22,490 --> 01:12:23,650
My quest is to be one.

1957
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:24,630
No.

1958
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:28,850
Okay.

1959
01:12:29,410 --> 01:12:30,890
I'm going in.

1960
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:31,490
I'm going in.

1961
01:12:31,610 --> 01:12:32,330
I'm going in.

1962
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:33,790
We're blue.

1963
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:36,290
Ow, you fucking punched me.

1964
01:12:36,370 --> 01:12:37,470
I thought you were going in the machine.

1965
01:12:39,190 --> 01:12:40,030
I'm trying.

1966
01:12:40,650 --> 01:12:42,170
No, I'm in it with him.

1967
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:43,130
No, I got him down.

1968
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:45,790
I thought you were going in ours.

1969
01:12:46,130 --> 01:12:47,010
Who's going in ours?

1970
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:49,810
No, I'm doing offense with you.

1971
01:12:50,530 --> 01:12:51,150
Oh, okay.

1972
01:12:51,170 --> 01:12:52,930
And then I'm picking the arcade when I do.

1973
01:12:54,650 --> 01:12:57,910
We need people at our machine.

1974
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:01,450
Alright.

1975
01:13:02,330 --> 01:13:02,950
I'm getting in.

1976
01:13:03,990 --> 01:13:04,890
You get involved.

1977
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:09,290
Wait, we need to stop them though.

1978
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:09,850
Oh my god.

1979
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:11,230
Wait, who's getting in ours?

1980
01:13:11,390 --> 01:13:12,450
Who's supposed to be getting in ours?

1981
01:13:12,870 --> 01:13:14,010
I don't know, but I'm...

1982
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:14,850
I think that was Doki.

1983
01:13:15,010 --> 01:13:16,430
No, I said I'm doing offense.

1984
01:13:16,990 --> 01:13:18,790
I'm doing offense and I'm doing theirs.

1985
01:13:19,030 --> 01:13:19,830
That's what I meant.

1986
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:21,750
You got it.

1987
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:21,990
You got it.

1988
01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:22,470
You got it.

1989
01:13:22,790 --> 01:13:23,190
No.

1990
01:13:26,050 --> 01:13:27,310
Okay, I'm going to need you to...

1991
01:13:27,790 --> 01:13:28,450
Wait, okay.

1992
01:13:30,130 --> 01:13:30,890
Oh my god.

1993
01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:32,590
Yeah, they did.

1994
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:33,150
They did.

1995
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:36,110
I'm trying to grab it so I can get on to the bomb.

1996
01:13:37,570 --> 01:13:37,970
Please.

1997
01:13:38,410 --> 01:13:39,010
I'm trying.

1998
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:40,790
Got him.

1999
01:13:41,490 --> 01:13:42,330
I'm grabbing him.

2000
01:13:42,470 --> 01:13:43,250
I'm grabbing him.

2001
01:13:43,270 --> 01:13:43,450
I'm grabbing him.

2002
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:43,850
I got him.

2003
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:44,190
I got him.

2004
01:13:45,070 --> 01:13:46,190
Wait, where am I?

2005
01:13:46,230 --> 01:13:46,650
Where am I?

2006
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:46,950
What?

2007
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:48,250
Oh my god, they knocked me out.

2008
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:50,650
I punched him out.

2009
01:13:51,410 --> 01:13:52,150
We got a bunch.

2010
01:13:52,330 --> 01:13:53,150
We got a bunch.

2011
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:55,990
Why would I grab the fucking stick?

2012
01:13:58,370 --> 01:13:58,810
I'm going.

2013
01:13:58,870 --> 01:13:59,110
I'm going.

2014
01:13:59,110 --> 01:13:59,390
I'm going.

2015
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:02,090
They keep trying to fucking get to the bomb.

2016
01:14:02,450 --> 01:14:02,810
Who's in it?

2017
01:14:02,830 --> 01:14:03,730
Give me the bomb.

2018
01:14:05,150 --> 01:14:05,870
You go.

2019
01:14:05,890 --> 01:14:06,230
You go.

2020
01:14:06,230 --> 01:14:06,450
You go.

2021
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:07,810
I'm trying.

2022
01:14:07,830 --> 01:14:08,170
I punched him.

2023
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:10,470
I'm trying to grab.

2024
01:14:11,230 --> 01:14:11,970
I punched him.

2025
01:14:12,050 --> 01:14:12,370
You go.

2026
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:12,650
You go.

2027
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:15,170
Punch him out.

2028
01:14:15,270 --> 01:14:16,190
They got me out.

2029
01:14:16,270 --> 01:14:16,790
They got me out.

2030
01:14:18,110 --> 01:14:18,470
Okay.

2031
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:21,590
I'm gone.

2032
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:22,030
I'm gone.

2033
01:14:22,070 --> 01:14:22,890
I'm on it.

2034
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:23,290
I'm on it.

2035
01:14:23,730 --> 01:14:25,330
Okay, we're all passed out.

2036
01:14:25,490 --> 01:14:27,390
Wait, you guys haven't grabbed anything.

2037
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:29,610
We're trying.

2038
01:14:29,950 --> 01:14:30,310
Okay.

2039
01:14:31,330 --> 01:14:31,690
No.

2040
01:14:32,150 --> 01:14:32,990
They got him.

2041
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:35,290
Oh shit.

2042
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:35,590
I'm sorry.

2043
01:14:35,990 --> 01:14:36,930
That was my bad.

2044
01:14:38,870 --> 01:14:39,430
Oh god.

2045
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:39,770
You got it.

2046
01:14:39,770 --> 01:14:39,950
Nice.

2047
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:40,250
Nice.

2048
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:40,450
Nice.

2049
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:41,150
No.

2050
01:14:41,570 --> 01:14:42,250
I'm out.

2051
01:14:42,330 --> 01:14:42,690
I'm out.

2052
01:14:43,130 --> 01:14:43,910
Oh my god.

2053
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:45,670
They're so good.

2054
01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:47,290
These are mines out there.

2055
01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:50,330
I got some points.

2056
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:51,250
Nice.

2057
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:52,230
I'm trying to grab.

2058
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:53,930
Grab me the machine, not the stick.

2059
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:54,970
Oh my god.

2060
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:56,710
Oh my god.

2061
01:14:56,730 --> 01:14:58,550
When you're on it, they can knock you out.

2062
01:14:58,630 --> 01:14:59,430
I noticed that.

2063
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:01,710
You don't have a shield when you're on it.

2064
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:03,630
Guys, I think it's over.

2065
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:04,610
When you're on the enemies.

2066
01:15:05,730 --> 01:15:06,850
I think it's over.

2067
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:08,570
I think it's over.

2068
01:15:10,450 --> 01:15:11,010
I think it's over, guys.

2069
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:12,970
I think it's over.

2070
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:14,210
I'm trying my best.

2071
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:14,770
I knocked them out.

2072
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:15,350
Grab the stick.

2073
01:15:15,690 --> 01:15:16,330
I'm trying.

2074
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:17,310
I knocked out two.

2075
01:15:17,630 --> 01:15:17,710
No.

2076
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:17,810
They got it.

2077
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:19,690
No.

2078
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:20,350
We got it.

2079
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:20,650
We got it.

2080
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:20,810
We're fine.

2081
01:15:20,890 --> 01:15:21,130
We're fine.

2082
01:15:21,210 --> 01:15:21,530
Okay.

2083
01:15:22,350 --> 01:15:24,210
I'm trying to knock them out.

2084
01:15:25,710 --> 01:15:27,190
Tripper, are you knocking them out?

2085
01:15:27,810 --> 01:15:29,110
Of course I am.

2086
01:15:30,430 --> 01:15:31,830
I got the bomb.

2087
01:15:31,950 --> 01:15:33,150
I spotted it with the bomb.

2088
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:33,810
My points.

2089
01:15:33,990 --> 01:15:34,430
No.

2090
01:15:34,650 --> 01:15:35,610
They got it.

2091
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:37,110
Cheeper.

2092
01:15:37,690 --> 01:15:38,130
Cheeper.

2093
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:43,880
It's okay.

2094
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:45,240
We have the second round.

2095
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:47,500
Guys, we have the second round.

2096
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:49,080
Look, they have a minecrafter.

2097
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:49,840
Yeah.

2098
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:53,240
What's the second round?

2099
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:55,880
The second round is...

2100
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:56,620
It's beast hockey.

2101
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:58,560
Oh, shit.

2102
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:00,440
That has ice.

2103
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,280
Lemonade my neck with dripping.

2104
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:04,880
All I'm going to do is beat up the goalie.

2105
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:05,880
That's all I'm going to do.

2106
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:13,780
I'm just here to beat up the goalie.

2107
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,580
That's supposed to be my...

2108
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:19,620
That's supposed to be my strat.

2109
01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:23,330
Wait.

2110
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:23,850
No, you don't.

2111
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:24,570
You're the one to score.

2112
01:16:26,190 --> 01:16:29,590
Well, usually when I play these, I only try and grief the enemy team.

2113
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:30,130
Okay.

2114
01:16:30,270 --> 01:16:30,670
Okay.

2115
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:32,350
But, like, are you good at scoring, though?

2116
01:16:33,710 --> 01:16:34,510
I don't know.

2117
01:16:36,190 --> 01:16:36,590
Wait.

2118
01:16:36,590 --> 01:16:37,230
I'm going to beat up the goalie.

2119
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:38,810
And then I'm going to...

2120
01:16:38,810 --> 01:16:40,250
I'm going to steal the shield.

2121
01:16:40,830 --> 01:16:42,010
I'll try my best.

2122
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:45,230
I'm going to steal this shield after.

2123
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:48,450
Wait.

2124
01:16:48,490 --> 01:16:48,750
That's...

2125
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:49,550
dank dank.

2126
01:16:51,970 --> 01:16:52,770
It's okay.

2127
01:16:54,230 --> 01:16:55,470
Doki, but you're Canadian.

2128
01:16:55,730 --> 01:16:58,650
Look, I have very limited knowledge on hockey.

2129
01:16:58,910 --> 01:16:59,970
Other than...

2130
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:02,950
other than the Canucks team.

2131
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:05,930
I played a lot of hockey when I was younger.

2132
01:17:06,230 --> 01:17:06,490
Wait.

2133
01:17:06,590 --> 01:17:07,110
Yeah.

2134
01:17:07,130 --> 01:17:07,230
Yeah.

2135
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:08,630
You're Canadian, too, Surefour.

2136
01:17:08,770 --> 01:17:09,890
You should be the scorer.

2137
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:11,890
I say you're...

2138
01:17:11,890 --> 01:17:14,910
I played right side defense when I played hockey.

2139
01:17:15,650 --> 01:17:16,210
Oh, yeah.

2140
01:17:16,210 --> 01:17:17,810
Today you're going to be offense today.

2141
01:17:18,770 --> 01:17:19,450
I'm offensive.

2142
01:17:21,150 --> 01:17:21,590
Okay.

2143
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:21,810
Don't worry.

2144
01:17:21,890 --> 01:17:22,310
I'm going in.

2145
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:23,950
I'm going in to steal it.

2146
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:24,910
Wait.

2147
01:17:24,930 --> 01:17:25,190
Wait.

2148
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:26,290
I got it out.

2149
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:27,290
I got it out.

2150
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:27,930
I got it out.

2151
01:17:27,930 --> 01:17:28,830
I distracted the goalie.

2152
01:17:29,310 --> 01:17:31,130
Surefour, this is your time.

2153
01:17:31,470 --> 01:17:32,170
I stole it.

2154
01:17:32,730 --> 01:17:33,210
Surefour.

2155
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:35,870
What the fuck do you want from me?

2156
01:17:35,890 --> 01:17:37,130
I literally saved us.

2157
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:38,910
And then I got knocked out.

2158
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:43,030
What am I supposed to do here?

2159
01:17:44,130 --> 01:17:47,470
All I'm saying is you had the Canadian buff.

2160
01:17:48,210 --> 01:17:48,690
Listen.

2161
01:17:48,850 --> 01:17:49,870
It's not just me.

2162
01:17:49,930 --> 01:17:50,910
Remember, 80%.

2163
01:17:51,850 --> 01:17:53,130
Who's our goalie?

2164
01:17:54,450 --> 01:17:55,410
It's not me.

2165
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:56,030
I'm out.

2166
01:17:56,330 --> 01:17:57,970
I'm fucking stealing your shield.

2167
01:17:58,110 --> 01:17:58,530
Oh, no!

2168
01:17:58,530 --> 01:18:00,590
We have no goalie!

2169
01:18:01,170 --> 01:18:03,730
I'm my offense and I'm my goalie!

2170
01:18:07,030 --> 01:18:07,550
Look!

2171
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:08,750
There's no one there!

2172
01:18:10,630 --> 01:18:14,890
The enemy team picked up our shield that they're supposed to use.

2173
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:18,790
I said I was.

2174
01:18:18,810 --> 01:18:19,690
I wasn't goalie.

2175
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:22,150
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

2176
01:18:22,730 --> 01:18:23,850
Go, go, go!

2177
01:18:23,850 --> 01:18:24,290
I'm knocked out!

2178
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:25,270
I'm knocked out!

2179
01:18:26,590 --> 01:18:27,530
I'm knocked out.

2180
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:27,870
I'm out.

2181
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:28,970
I'm out cold.

2182
01:18:29,090 --> 01:18:30,070
I'm fucking dead.

2183
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:31,250
Nice!

2184
01:18:32,130 --> 01:18:32,550
Nice.

2185
01:18:33,830 --> 01:18:34,250
Yes!

2186
01:18:36,110 --> 01:18:36,530
Yippee!

2187
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:38,930
Yippee!

2188
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:40,170
You idiot!

2189
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:49,470
See, you say I'm offense but we got two on the offensive side so I have to play defense!

2190
01:18:50,590 --> 01:18:52,010
Wait, we can have two offense?

2191
01:18:53,390 --> 01:18:54,690
But then we have no defense!

2192
01:18:55,390 --> 01:18:56,950
Oh, wait, what about the other girls?

2193
01:18:57,030 --> 01:18:58,370
What are you trying to say about the other girls?

2194
01:18:59,550 --> 01:19:02,370
All I'm saying is I'm the flex right now.

2195
01:19:03,970 --> 01:19:06,130
Okay, look, I'm getting rid of the goalie right now.

2196
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:09,110
Look, I'm getting rid of the goalie.

2197
01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:10,350
The goalie got rid of me though.

2198
01:19:10,530 --> 01:19:12,390
The goalie got rid of me.

2199
01:19:13,490 --> 01:19:14,370
I punched him.

2200
01:19:15,910 --> 01:19:16,310
Okay.

2201
01:19:16,730 --> 01:19:17,570
I'm trying to.

2202
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:18,670
I'm just punching them all out.

2203
01:19:19,290 --> 01:19:20,370
They stole our shield.

2204
01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:21,210
They stole our shield.

2205
01:19:21,510 --> 01:19:22,950
I got the shield!

2206
01:19:23,030 --> 01:19:23,990
I'm coming back for you guys!

2207
01:19:24,470 --> 01:19:27,530
I got the shield for you too!

2208
01:19:27,550 --> 01:19:27,870
Uh oh.

2209
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:29,550
Uh oh.

2210
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:33,310
Why are you stealing?

2211
01:19:35,910 --> 01:19:36,750
Ping def.

2212
01:19:38,050 --> 01:19:38,650
No!

2213
01:19:39,930 --> 01:19:40,330
No!

2214
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:45,020
I hit the shield.

2215
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:45,920
Oh!

2216
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:47,860
No!

2217
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:48,980
We're out!

2218
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:50,580
It's okay.

2219
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:52,240
I'm getting my wood.

2220
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:53,080
Oh my god!

2221
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:55,260
Bro, this guy is a minecrafter right there.

2222
01:19:55,740 --> 01:19:57,880
I fucking dropped his shield.

2223
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:58,260
No!

2224
01:19:58,580 --> 01:19:59,180
Oh!

2225
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:00,320
What's going on?

2226
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:00,800
What's going on?

2227
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:02,680
They grabbed our shield.

2228
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:03,660
They grabbed your shield?

2229
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:04,280
I got it!

2230
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:04,800
I got it back!

2231
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:05,120
Oh my god!

2232
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:05,480
Nice!

2233
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:05,620
Nice!

2234
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:06,380
Grab the shield back!

2235
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:07,000
Grab the shield back!

2236
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:07,740
Nice!

2237
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:08,060
Nice!

2238
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:08,240
Nice!

2239
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:09,940
It's okay!

2240
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:11,300
Here, do you want me to defend?

2241
01:20:11,620 --> 01:20:11,840
You go.

2242
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:12,820
I got the shield!

2243
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:13,400
I got the shield!

2244
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:14,600
Nice!

2245
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:16,380
They got the shield back.

2246
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:17,320
They got the shield back.

2247
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:18,720
Nice!

2248
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:20,300
I knocked that bit out.

2249
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:21,340
Okay.

2250
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:21,720
Yeah.

2251
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,380
You can tell this guy is a party animal player.

2252
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:26,480
Ow!

2253
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:27,060
Oh!

2254
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:27,400
I died!

2255
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:28,720
I knocked him out!

2256
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:30,700
Nice!

2257
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:31,440
Oh my god!

2258
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:32,120
I got the goalie!

2259
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:32,780
I got the goalie!

2260
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,280
And I got the shield!

2261
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:36,320
Nice!

2262
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:36,740
Nice!

2263
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:36,980
Nice!

2264
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:37,120
Nice!

2265
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:44,600
What is happening to this pup?

2266
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:45,020
Okay.

2267
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:47,480
Yeah, I knocked one out.

2268
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:47,800
Oh fuck.

2269
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:48,900
Oh my god.

2270
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:49,740
Nice!

2271
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:50,160
Okay!

2272
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:52,180
Uuugh!

2273
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,000
That's your part!

2274
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:56,240
Oh!

2275
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:56,680
I jumped!

2276
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:56,980
No!

2277
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:57,720
No!

2278
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:57,760
Yeah!

2279
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:02,500
Guys, this is all looking so good.

2280
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:03,640
No, no, no.

2281
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:04,560
This is our comeback.

2282
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:05,440
This is our comeback.

2283
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:05,940
It's good.

2284
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:06,200
It's our comeback.

2285
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:07,240
It's our comeback.

2286
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:07,460
It's the winnable.

2287
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:09,960
It's the winnable.

2288
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:12,260
Guys, we're losers too.

2289
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:16,140
Okay, okay.

2290
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:17,540
I'm coming in to actually help.

2291
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:18,240
For real.

2292
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:19,960
Oh, okay!

2293
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:21,020
Hey, I'm for real this time!

2294
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:22,160
For real, for real.

2295
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:23,000
I'm actually here.

2296
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:27,320
I shall assist.

2297
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:28,960
Okay.

2298
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,060
I shall use my Canadian debuff.

2299
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:33,660
I shall use my Canadian debuff.

2300
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:34,440
That's it, Jill Bart.

2301
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:36,380
Knocked me out too many times.

2302
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:37,600
Oh my god.

2303
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:39,300
Oh my god!

2304
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:42,340
I'm hanging over!

2305
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:43,640
What do you want me to do?!

2306
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:44,960
I'm literally here!

2307
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:48,260
You hit me twice!

2308
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,360
You hit me twice!

2309
01:21:52,460 --> 01:21:52,700
You hit me twice!

2310
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:53,620
You hit me twice!

2311
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:57,560
You hit me twice!

2312
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:00,900
I set that up for you, man.

2313
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:01,780
I set it up.

2314
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:03,700
Yeah, and I knocked out two of them motherfuckers.

2315
01:22:13,820 --> 01:22:14,440
Okay, wait.

2316
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:14,860
I'm waiting.

2317
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:15,600
I'm waiting for the pass.

2318
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:17,680
Okay.

2319
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:18,560
Oh, not that bit.

2320
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:19,860
Yes.

2321
01:22:20,660 --> 01:22:21,300
Oh, no!

2322
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:24,700
Oh, shit!

2323
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:26,140
Oh, shit.

2324
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:26,940
I almost knocked you out.

2325
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:29,620
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

2326
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:30,700
Nice!

2327
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:31,000
Nice!

2328
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,180
It's a party animal.

2329
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:38,680
No!

2330
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:42,520
Guys, I got some bad news.

2331
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:43,740
They only need one more.

2332
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:47,380
Oh, guys, guys, surely, surely we can come back.

2333
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:48,840
It's a comeback right here, right?

2334
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:49,200
Surely.

2335
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:50,160
Okay.

2336
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:51,780
They're just getting hard bullied, though.

2337
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:53,080
It's a comeback.

2338
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:53,680
It's a comeback.

2339
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:55,760
It's so wittable.

2340
01:22:56,060 --> 01:22:57,040
It's so wittable.

2341
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:58,780
It's the comeback of the century.

2342
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:00,680
This is it.

2343
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:03,700
Oh, shit.

2344
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:04,500
Our goalie's down.

2345
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:05,040
Oh, no!

2346
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:05,680
Our goalie's down.

2347
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:08,040
Okay.

2348
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:09,840
Oh, I'm down!

2349
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:22,500
This is just a round robin.

2350
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,440
We're not last because we won our one game.

2351
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:25,900
That's all that matters.

2352
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:26,440
That's true.

2353
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:27,280
We're not last.

2354
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:28,320
We're not last.

2355
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:31,440
Does that mean we progress or are we out?

2356
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:34,760
No, this was a round robin, so then we have seeded after this.

2357
01:23:35,660 --> 01:23:37,320
Then it's like single elimination, I think.

2358
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:39,180
Then it's like single elimination, I think.

2359
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:42,040
Then it's like single elimination, I think.

2360
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:42,320
It's single elimination after this.

2361
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:43,580
Which is good!

2362
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:46,380
We purposely lost so we can get easier games.

2363
01:23:46,820 --> 01:23:47,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

2364
01:23:47,740 --> 01:23:48,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

2365
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:50,900
Doki, I have some bad news for you.

2366
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:52,000
That's not how seeding works.

2367
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:59,420
If you're last, that means you go against If you're last, that means you go against top seed, which means you go against the hardest opponent.

2368
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:01,740
No, that's not how that works.

2369
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:03,580
There's no way.

2370
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:05,220
That's how that works, actually.

2371
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:07,820
Where did you get those rules?

2372
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,040
Who told you that?

2373
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:10,580
It was your pro player.

2374
01:24:10,740 --> 01:24:11,660
Who told you?

2375
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:12,880
You were a pro player.

2376
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:14,780
I played professional video games.

2377
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:17,200
You were a pro player, but times have changed.

2378
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:19,400
Times have not changed.

2379
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:22,360
Maybe in the VTuber world, but this is the Twitch Rivals.

2380
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:22,920
Times have changed.

2381
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:25,280
This is the Twitch Rivals.

2382
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:27,160
It's not VTuber exclusive.

2383
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:31,020
Okay, but like, why would they put us in the...

2384
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:33,200
Why would they put us in the harder queues when we're losing?

2385
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:33,980
Wake up to reality.

2386
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:36,180
Nothing goes right in this accursed world.

2387
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:38,520
No, but things are supposed to go right!

2388
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:43,280
It's supposed to be our world!

2389
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:45,440
Crying emoji.

2390
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:46,300
Okay.

2391
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:49,320
Alright, how is the seating?

2392
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:50,420
Okay, second stage.

2393
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:51,240
Single elimination.

2394
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:54,360
Best of three games.

2395
01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:55,820
First to three points.

2396
01:24:56,180 --> 01:24:58,020
Oh, it's first to three points.

2397
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:58,580
Oh, okay.

2398
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:01,260
Uh...

2399
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,500
Wait, but it doesn't even tell...

2400
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:05,120
Oh, I think it's just...

2401
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:07,940
Is it just beat-em-up or quarterfinals?

2402
01:25:07,940 --> 01:25:10,720
Conveyor trebuchet wind tunnel.

2403
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:12,420
Oh no.

2404
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:13,020
What's conveyor?

2405
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:14,860
Con...

2406
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:16,900
Oh god, wait, what is conveyor?

2407
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:18,400
Shrug.

2408
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:20,280
What is conveyor?

2409
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,160
What is conveyor, guys?

2410
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:26,200
What is this?

2411
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:28,920
Oh, it's a big conveyor.

2412
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:32,180
Yeah, but is it like PvP or...

2413
01:25:32,180 --> 01:25:34,760
Yeah, last stand is like PvP.

2414
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,220
You have to dump people off.

2415
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:37,260
Um...

2416
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:42,560
There's a bunch of weapons that spawn in and then you pick them up and then you dump them off the side.

2417
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:43,360
Oh, okay.

2418
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:48,880
So, hopefully this should be good, cause it's just beating people up.

2419
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:51,280
Yeah, yeah, hopefully that'll be easy, right?

2420
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:53,060
Yeah.

2421
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:54,600
I love beating people up.

2422
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:55,460
Yeah.

2423
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:56,460
See, that's good.

2424
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:01,860
I'm buying earth runes right now.

2425
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:02,820
Hopefully.

2426
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:06,140
We got this.

2427
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:07,260
You're min-mining again?

2428
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:09,040
Yeah.

2429
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:11,680
Okay, back to my dailies.

2430
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:14,620
Back to your dailies?

2431
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,240
Free, entertain us!

2432
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:18,740
I'm playing Neopets!

2433
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:19,860
Entertain us!

2434
01:26:19,940 --> 01:26:21,340
I got more core stuff to do!

2435
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:23,740
People still play Neopets?

2436
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:32,240
Yeah, they like recently uh, they recently sold Neopets to uh, some tech guy who is like a Neopets fan.

2437
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:35,440
Yeah, who like is actually like doing stuff.

2438
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,240
And then they're rebuilding Yeah, they're rebuilding the...

2439
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:41,340
Uh, they're rebuilding the... Does it still look like it was made in 2001?

2440
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:43,160
No, it's... Yes.

2441
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:44,340
Oh, okay.

2442
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:47,100
It looks like it was made in like 2012.

2443
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:48,680
Huh.

2444
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:50,480
They upgraded it a little bit.

2445
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:51,440
Huh.

2446
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:53,400
Huh.

2447
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:55,400
Right.

2448
01:26:55,560 --> 01:27:00,260
I know like, I know they're trying to do like something, uh...

2449
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:04,160
I know they're trying to do like some updates to it.

2450
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:05,880
And adding new game modes.

2451
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:06,120
Yeah.

2452
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:06,900
No, they're doing a lot.

2453
01:27:06,940 --> 01:27:08,880
Like they're doing events and stuff finally.

2454
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:11,820
And they brought back unconverted pets.

2455
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:13,120
Which is amazing.

2456
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:14,520
Oh yeah, I remember that.

2457
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:15,080
Yeah.

2458
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:17,140
I remember that.

2459
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:20,140
Because they sent like a fucking newsletter out to everybody about it.

2460
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:20,680
Yeah!

2461
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:21,520
Yeah.

2462
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:25,780
I'm autistic enough that I cried when they brought back, uh, unconverted pets.

2463
01:27:25,780 --> 01:27:30,080
Yeah, cause then you can like, you, people were like selling it for like crazy amount of real money.

2464
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:31,680
It was like hundreds of dollars.

2465
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:37,000
If you could get a Pokemon, or a Pokemon, a Neopet with like a good name, it was genuinely hundreds of dollars.

2466
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:41,080
It was like, yeah.

2467
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:47,360
And I remember like you can actually buy like real Neopoints and like real paintbrushes, like instead of real fucking money.

2468
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:48,540
Yeah.

2469
01:27:49,580 --> 01:27:51,060
Wait, did you actually cry?

2470
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:52,740
Yeah.

2471
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:53,640
No, cause I'm autistic.

2472
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:57,920
That wasn't a joke.

2473
01:27:57,980 --> 01:27:59,680
I was just, you know, you know.

2474
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:01,360
My god, that was fairy sweet talk.

2475
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:05,040
Little like seven year old Brute was really happy, okay?

2476
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:10,420
I was living a really good life.

2477
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:12,320
Yeah.

2478
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:13,680
I miss Neopets.

2479
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:16,940
I used to like, grind that game as if it was a fucking job.

2480
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:18,680
Dude, same.

2481
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:21,420
When I was like really young, cause like that was my life.

2482
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:22,900
Oh yeah, when I was young too.

2483
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:26,060
I did Neopet dailies.

2484
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:29,720
Just like how people today do Genshin dailies.

2485
01:28:29,820 --> 01:28:30,700
And Honkai dailies.

2486
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:31,320
I do Neopet dailies.

2487
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:33,640
Yeah, no, I did that when I was a child.

2488
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:35,100
Yeah, I stopped when I became an adult.

2489
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:36,800
And there was like a website called Sunny Neo or something.

2490
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:37,880
Sunny Neo!

2491
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,900
And then they would have like a checklist of like, here's some stuff you have to do every day.

2492
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,520
And then I would click every link every day to make sure I could get my dailies done.

2493
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:48,720
Neopets was my gacha.

2494
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:48,940
Yeah.

2495
01:28:48,940 --> 01:28:49,880
Yes, but it was free.

2496
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:54,460
The only time I was spending was, the only thing I was spending was my time.

2497
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:59,180
Time is money.

2498
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:01,720
I was not spending actual money.

2499
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:07,200
I didn't get scammed into doing the whole, what was it?

2500
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:10,280
The Neopets exclusive shit.

2501
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:13,400
Doki is just hurting my feelings right now.

2502
01:29:13,420 --> 01:29:14,980
Every single sentence.

2503
01:29:15,340 --> 01:29:17,460
Yeah, imagine spending money on Neopets.

2504
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:19,000
I didn't spend real money on that.

2505
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:20,960
Into the Neomall.

2506
01:29:21,140 --> 01:29:22,460
That's wild.

2507
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:24,060
Imagine spending money on this game.

2508
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:24,360
I know, right?

2509
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:28,920
Imagine spending money on Neomall and Neopets Premium for the Super Wizard.

2510
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:31,720
Just because you wanted to, like, search up the lowest prices.

2511
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:33,860
Yeah.

2512
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:34,520
That's crazy.

2513
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:35,780
It's not worth your time.

2514
01:29:35,860 --> 01:29:36,320
That's crazy.

2515
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:40,220
I don't know what the hell is going on.

2516
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:44,640
Doki is hurting my feelings and making fun of my spending choices.

2517
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:45,400
That's what's happening.

2518
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:47,860
That's sick.

2519
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:49,740
Oh my god.

2520
01:29:49,740 --> 01:29:51,120
Look, I got priorities, okay?

2521
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:52,920
My priorities are very stupid.

2522
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:54,440
Oh my god.

2523
01:29:54,500 --> 01:30:04,400
You know, like, when we were fighting at Joe's team, a bunch of his... I don't know if it was happening in the chat, but a bunch of his chatters came to my chat just to, like, cheer for Joe.

2524
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:06,240
Really?

2525
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:07,040
That's funny.

2526
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:08,640
What supportive guys.

2527
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:12,540
And then when we lost, we were like, Yeah!

2528
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:13,660
Joe's better!

2529
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:16,180
And I was just like, what the fuck?

2530
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:17,960
Happy little guys.

2531
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:26,740
Got to tone down that happiness there to their own chat.

2532
01:30:29,940 --> 01:30:30,980
Chat hoppers.

2533
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:33,340
Yeah.

2534
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:34,580
Preview!

2535
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:37,300
That's true.

2536
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:39,660
That's true.

2537
01:30:39,780 --> 01:30:42,740
It's not showing up with the map.

2538
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:44,460
What?

2539
01:30:44,540 --> 01:30:44,980
What do you mean?

2540
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:47,040
The new game.

2541
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:47,940
It's not showing up.

2542
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,020
Oh, the quarterfinals?

2543
01:30:50,180 --> 01:30:50,600
Oh shit!

2544
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:51,540
The quarterfinals!

2545
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:53,700
Who played against these people?

2546
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:55,040
ZuriSparks.

2547
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:56,400
No, they're all new people.

2548
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:56,800
Nice.

2549
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,140
Alright, if we lose this, we're out.

2550
01:30:58,360 --> 01:30:59,340
Just so you guys know.

2551
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:04,380
It is life or death for real.

2552
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:07,140
It don't feel so good.

2553
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:08,620
It's life or death.

2554
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:11,320
Right here.

2555
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:13,180
Wait, it is not showing up.

2556
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:13,680
Right here.

2557
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:14,060
Right now.

2558
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:15,520
I thought you were lying.

2559
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:18,580
Why would I be lying?

2560
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:20,000
I thought you were lying about this.

2561
01:31:20,260 --> 01:31:21,120
Compulsive liar.

2562
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:23,900
I know, because you lied about your resume.

2563
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:26,480
I'm sorry.

2564
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:27,660
You saw that first round.

2565
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:29,580
I carried at least two things to the exit.

2566
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:31,800
Did we see that second and third round?

2567
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:34,180
I think that was...

2568
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:35,880
I'm just being held back.

2569
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:37,940
You're being held back?

2570
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:40,660
Name names right now!

2571
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:41,500
Who is it?

2572
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:43,880
I don't really want to.

2573
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:45,720
Not to cause any drama.

2574
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:49,260
I'm just saying that I'm not being let...

2575
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:52,840
Show my true skill in this game.

2576
01:31:57,940 --> 01:31:58,420
Alright.

2577
01:31:58,660 --> 01:32:00,560
Why is it not showing up?

2578
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,740
I wanna join.

2579
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:04,580
I wanna be part.

2580
01:32:04,580 --> 01:32:04,740
I wanna be part.

2581
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:08,900
Still not created yet.

2582
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:09,140
Oh.

2583
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:11,440
We... Okay.

2584
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:14,520
Team Squeaks and Team Joe are against each other.

2585
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:16,780
So if we win this, we might have to go against Joe again.

2586
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:17,900
Joe?

2587
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:18,460
Joe Mama.

2588
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:19,240
Okay.

2589
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:22,480
That's weird.

2590
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:23,880
I haven't seen it yet.

2591
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:24,220
Alright.

2592
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:26,380
Somebody send this guy a friend ID.

2593
01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:29,060
And I will invite you.

2594
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:29,720
And then...

2595
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:30,320
Free.

2596
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:30,960
You...

2597
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:33,620
You give your friend ID there.

2598
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,120
And then invite us.

2599
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Okay.

2600
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:37,520
Copy.

2601
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:38,280
What's going on?

2602
01:32:38,580 --> 01:32:39,100
Oh.

2603
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:41,580
Apparently the room is not showable.

2604
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:45,120
So like they have to invite us individually with the friend ID.

2605
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:47,080
What the?

2606
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:51,860
So we just gotta wait.

2607
01:32:53,260 --> 01:32:53,860
How long?

2608
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:54,340
We gotta wait.

2609
01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:58,260
The first one to die is dead weight.

2610
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:01,780
Alright.

2611
01:33:01,820 --> 01:33:03,400
Everyone make sure Doki dies.

2612
01:33:03,660 --> 01:33:03,960
What?

2613
01:33:05,620 --> 01:33:06,720
I'm the captain.

2614
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:08,020
I can't be dead weight.

2615
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:11,460
Captains are usually the dead weight.

2616
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:12,420
I literally scored.

2617
01:33:13,180 --> 01:33:15,480
I was the only person that scored.

2618
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:18,100
Captains are usually supposed to be the charismatic person to bring people together.

2619
01:33:18,220 --> 01:33:19,640
Not to actually do anything.

2620
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:21,080
It's like a CEO.

2621
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:23,060
Okay.

2622
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:23,580
Okay.

2623
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:25,260
But I actually did stuff.

2624
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:28,720
Keep telling yourself that.

2625
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:29,060
Oh yeah.

2626
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:29,700
The first game.

2627
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:30,320
The first game.

2628
01:33:30,420 --> 01:33:33,000
I scored almost all the goals in the first game.

2629
01:33:33,700 --> 01:33:34,920
Who set up those scores?

2630
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:36,040
The second game.

2631
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:39,440
I scored the only goal in the second game.

2632
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:40,000
That was luck.

2633
01:33:40,460 --> 01:33:41,760
I also kicked it forward.

2634
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:43,040
I knocked two people out.

2635
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:44,640
Oh yeah.

2636
01:33:44,740 --> 01:33:45,280
Game three.

2637
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:47,140
I set up the goal for you.

2638
01:33:48,220 --> 01:33:50,620
I knocked two people out before you set it up.

2639
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:54,440
See, this is the self-centered thinking we're talking about here.

2640
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:57,320
This is team games, but you're only thinking about what you did.

2641
01:33:57,320 --> 01:34:00,960
Yeah, but you're self-centered as well because you were telling people that you did all that stuff as well.

2642
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:04,100
You told Gus that you were 80% of the team I'm just saying my piece of the story.

2643
01:34:04,220 --> 01:34:06,160
My story matters.

2644
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:16,280
What is the friend ID?

2645
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:18,480
It's in your fucking profile.

2646
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:20,580
In Party Atlas.

2647
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:26,100
Are they just waiting for us?

2648
01:34:26,540 --> 01:34:27,760
Where are you?

2649
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:29,780
Where is this room?

2650
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:32,860
So am I.

2651
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:34,640
What do they want?

2652
01:34:38,180 --> 01:34:39,380
Calm down.

2653
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:40,120
Try again.

2654
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:42,120
Oh god.

2655
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:43,800
I've been searching up for too long.

2656
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:46,440
You told me to calm down.

2657
01:34:49,020 --> 01:34:49,720
What the?

2658
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:04,120
Do I just like add someone to wait to get invited?

2659
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:10,940
Yeah, we have to wait for Bree to get in and then she's gonna invite us in a vision.

2660
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:12,600
She's gonna invite me and then I'll invite you too.

2661
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:14,520
Okay.

2662
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:16,760
Okay, accept.

2663
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:19,880
Whoa.

2664
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:21,820
Okay.

2665
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:23,660
Invite a friend.

2666
01:35:25,860 --> 01:35:26,700
Oh, wait.

2667
01:35:26,860 --> 01:35:28,200
Do I have to add you guys?

2668
01:35:28,420 --> 01:35:28,840
Oh, no.

2669
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:31,040
Guys.

2670
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:33,160
Just add me.

2671
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:34,820
There.

2672
01:35:36,180 --> 01:35:37,220
Did you add me?

2673
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:39,500
I did it on Party Animals.

2674
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:40,560
I did it.

2675
01:35:40,980 --> 01:35:42,800
Yo, one new game friend?

2676
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:46,280
I have friends.

2677
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:47,620
Thank you.

2678
01:35:48,780 --> 01:35:49,300
Yay!

2679
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:51,700
Okay, Trevor got in as well.

2680
01:35:51,820 --> 01:35:52,240
Alright, nice.

2681
01:35:54,180 --> 01:35:55,360
I'm here to slay.

2682
01:35:57,820 --> 01:35:59,560
Yeah, the last is the beat up.

2683
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:01,540
Oh, okay.

2684
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:04,080
How come we couldn't find this lobby?

2685
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:04,880
Like, what the fuck?

2686
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:05,920
I don't know.

2687
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:08,480
Oh, it's because you didn't put the space dash.

2688
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:09,120
Oh!

2689
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:13,280
I just put the jar and I couldn't find it.

2690
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:14,900
I nearly copied and pasted this.

2691
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:16,080
So that's on there.

2692
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:20,040
Well, yeah, because in the copy-paste, there's no space bar.

2693
01:36:20,700 --> 01:36:21,140
Oh.

2694
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:21,860
Oh.

2695
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:27,240
Okay, so all we do is beat them up and then throw them out.

2696
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:28,160
Are you guys going to throw things?

2697
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:31,040
Yeah, I'm going on the sauce.

2698
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:31,520
Alright.

2699
01:36:31,740 --> 01:36:33,440
Whoever dies first is a dead weight.

2700
01:36:34,540 --> 01:36:35,960
I'm knocking Doki Bird out.

2701
01:36:36,180 --> 01:36:36,560
What?

2702
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:42,160
How could you do this to the captain?

2703
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:44,420
How could you do this?

2704
01:36:44,460 --> 01:36:45,600
I can't believe you've done this.

2705
01:36:45,620 --> 01:36:46,560
I can't believe it.

2706
01:36:47,540 --> 01:36:48,360
We're a team.

2707
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:51,260
I got a bomb.

2708
01:36:52,180 --> 01:36:52,920
That's not good.

2709
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:53,960
Oh my god.

2710
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:55,140
I didn't get anybody.

2711
01:36:56,980 --> 01:36:57,940
Get up!

2712
01:36:58,240 --> 01:36:58,440
Get up!

2713
01:36:58,540 --> 01:36:59,020
Get up!

2714
01:36:59,020 --> 01:36:59,500
Get up!

2715
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:00,460
Get up!

2716
01:37:02,460 --> 01:37:02,940
Get up!

2717
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:12,360
Wait, how do I get up?

2718
01:37:12,980 --> 01:37:13,920
Wait, how do I...

2719
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:15,680
Oh, it's so hard when you're on the side.

2720
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:16,540
I don't know how to get up.

2721
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:18,200
Okay, it's up to you guys.

2722
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:18,660
I'm out.

2723
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:20,620
Oh, my Doki!

2724
01:37:20,940 --> 01:37:22,420
Wait, were you the first one out?

2725
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:23,320
No, Ditto was.

2726
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:24,040
Ditto was.

2727
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:24,760
Me.

2728
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:25,420
No!

2729
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:28,300
I got my one.

2730
01:37:28,460 --> 01:37:29,360
I got my one.

2731
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:32,300
I thought Ditto would fucking walk off the conveyor.

2732
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:38,260
Okay, I'm alive.

2733
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:38,700
I'm alive.

2734
01:37:38,740 --> 01:37:38,980
I'm alive.

2735
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:39,320
No!

2736
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:43,420
How did that happen?

2737
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:44,640
Okay, wait.

2738
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:46,140
I'm throwing bombs.

2739
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:47,460
I'm throwing bombs for you guys.

2740
01:37:49,180 --> 01:37:49,820
Uh-oh.

2741
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:50,720
Uh-oh, never mind.

2742
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:51,060
I'm...

2743
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:52,060
I might be dead.

2744
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:53,660
No, no, no.

2745
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:54,660
This is the end.

2746
01:37:55,020 --> 01:37:55,980
Wait, wait, wait.

2747
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:56,580
I'm okay.

2748
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:58,700
You're okay.

2749
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:00,260
I'm dead.

2750
01:38:01,220 --> 01:38:03,540
Free, this is it.

2751
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:04,240
This is on you.

2752
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:04,940
This is...

2753
01:38:04,940 --> 01:38:07,280
This is all on you.

2754
01:38:08,540 --> 01:38:09,340
Okay, goodbye.

2755
01:38:10,180 --> 01:38:10,580
Goodbye.

2756
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:12,620
Goodbye.

2757
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:13,980
I threw a banana.

2758
01:38:19,990 --> 01:38:21,250
That was their one.

2759
01:38:21,290 --> 01:38:21,910
That was their one.

2760
01:38:22,030 --> 01:38:22,670
That was their one.

2761
01:38:22,810 --> 01:38:22,890
That was their one.

2762
01:38:23,810 --> 01:38:25,030
Ditto is not okay.

2763
01:38:25,230 --> 01:38:27,510
I'm in time.

2764
01:38:27,550 --> 01:38:28,110
I'm in time.

2765
01:38:28,150 --> 01:38:28,370
I missed.

2766
01:38:29,870 --> 01:38:30,510
Oh, free!

2767
01:38:30,690 --> 01:38:30,950
Free!

2768
01:38:32,730 --> 01:38:33,530
I'm scared.

2769
01:38:33,630 --> 01:38:34,190
I'm so scared.

2770
01:38:34,270 --> 01:38:34,890
I'm so scared.

2771
01:38:35,230 --> 01:38:35,630
No!

2772
01:38:36,910 --> 01:38:37,470
Uh-oh.

2773
01:38:37,570 --> 01:38:38,150
Save me.

2774
01:38:38,310 --> 01:38:38,850
Save me.

2775
01:38:38,950 --> 01:38:40,310
No shot!

2776
01:38:40,310 --> 01:38:40,490
No shot!

2777
01:38:41,630 --> 01:38:42,490
What happened?

2778
01:38:42,770 --> 01:38:43,650
What happened?

2779
01:38:45,470 --> 01:38:46,910
What happened from far?

2780
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:48,270
I thought this was your game!

2781
01:38:48,770 --> 01:38:50,010
Honestly, this is pinged.

2782
01:38:50,610 --> 01:38:52,790
Yeah, this is pinged.

2783
01:38:53,650 --> 01:38:54,490
Oh, I fell!

2784
01:38:56,250 --> 01:38:56,710
Guys.

2785
01:38:57,010 --> 01:38:57,990
Alright guys, it's up to you.

2786
01:38:58,030 --> 01:38:58,370
Good luck.

2787
01:38:59,290 --> 01:38:59,750
Guys.

2788
01:39:01,690 --> 01:39:05,530
When I heard I fell off and I'm the only one here now, I'm scared.

2789
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:07,270
No, you got Ditto.

2790
01:39:07,450 --> 01:39:08,030
Ditto's there.

2791
01:39:09,710 --> 01:39:10,890
Oh my gosh!

2792
01:39:11,970 --> 01:39:12,970
Ditto, are you still alive?

2793
01:39:13,950 --> 01:39:14,430
Yeah.

2794
01:39:14,850 --> 01:39:16,550
I don't know how to jump off this one.

2795
01:39:16,750 --> 01:39:17,490
What do you mean?

2796
01:39:17,690 --> 01:39:20,410
Oh, not that way!

2797
01:39:20,730 --> 01:39:23,610
Now you're the only one.

2798
01:39:23,810 --> 01:39:24,430
Okay, now I'm still here.

2799
01:39:25,130 --> 01:39:25,610
What?

2800
01:39:25,930 --> 01:39:28,390
What do you mean?

2801
01:39:29,370 --> 01:39:30,850
Now you're the only one.

2802
01:39:31,050 --> 01:39:32,230
They're all coming after me!

2803
01:39:32,950 --> 01:39:34,210
Hey, freaking kill them.

2804
01:39:35,730 --> 01:39:36,610
I don't know.

2805
01:39:36,950 --> 01:39:38,110
I don't know, guys.

2806
01:39:39,990 --> 01:39:40,470
Bumba.

2807
01:39:41,970 --> 01:39:42,270
No.

2808
01:39:43,610 --> 01:39:46,730
You just got put in the fucking montage.

2809
01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:49,730
Oh my gosh.

2810
01:39:50,030 --> 01:39:51,070
Alright, this is the comeback.

2811
01:39:51,590 --> 01:39:53,050
I got knocked out instantly.

2812
01:39:53,110 --> 01:39:54,010
I don't know, guys.

2813
01:39:54,070 --> 01:39:55,290
Okay, you just pushed me!

2814
01:39:55,670 --> 01:39:56,030
Sorry.

2815
01:39:56,590 --> 01:39:58,630
I would take one guy with me.

2816
01:39:59,990 --> 01:40:01,410
You took one guy with you?

2817
01:40:01,450 --> 01:40:01,750
Hell yeah!

2818
01:40:03,050 --> 01:40:04,530
Guys, I can't get back up.

2819
01:40:04,610 --> 01:40:04,950
Oh, I can.

2820
01:40:05,590 --> 01:40:05,990
Okay.

2821
01:40:07,370 --> 01:40:10,330
Okay, I'm gonna try and kill him and then I'm gonna take him down with me as well.

2822
01:40:11,110 --> 01:40:11,510
Yeah.

2823
01:40:12,110 --> 01:40:13,410
That's my plan now.

2824
01:40:15,410 --> 01:40:15,990
No!

2825
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:17,610
Oh my god!

2826
01:40:17,610 --> 01:40:18,010
He's growing!

2827
01:40:18,370 --> 01:40:19,210
He has the spinach!

2828
01:40:20,790 --> 01:40:21,370
Okay.

2829
01:40:21,730 --> 01:40:22,990
He has the spinach.

2830
01:40:23,010 --> 01:40:23,750
I'm a little scared.

2831
01:40:23,850 --> 01:40:23,970
Okay.

2832
01:40:25,630 --> 01:40:26,210
Ow!

2833
01:40:27,030 --> 01:40:27,610
Jump!

2834
01:40:28,210 --> 01:40:29,250
Oh no!

2835
01:40:31,870 --> 01:40:33,030
Help me!

2836
01:40:33,050 --> 01:40:33,350
Thank you!

2837
01:40:33,450 --> 01:40:35,030
Thank you so much!

2838
01:40:35,030 --> 01:40:36,110
My hero academia.

2839
01:40:36,790 --> 01:40:37,710
Oh my god.

2840
01:40:38,350 --> 01:40:39,030
Oh no.

2841
01:40:40,370 --> 01:40:40,770
Back

2842
01:40:46,070 --> 01:40:46,350
up!

2843
01:40:46,590 --> 01:40:47,150
Oh, there you go.

2844
01:40:47,930 --> 01:40:49,050
Guys, I'm struggling!

2845
01:40:50,290 --> 01:40:53,650
If you jump kick, I think it's more of a chance to get up.

2846
01:40:53,810 --> 01:40:54,090
Oh, really?

2847
01:40:54,230 --> 01:40:54,370
Okay.

2848
01:40:54,510 --> 01:40:55,290
That's good to know.

2849
01:40:57,610 --> 01:40:58,010
No!

2850
01:40:58,010 --> 01:40:58,770
Oh, I died.

2851
01:40:59,170 --> 01:40:59,770
Oh no.

2852
01:41:00,230 --> 01:41:01,570
Oh, now there's three.

2853
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:02,530
Oh god.

2854
01:41:05,190 --> 01:41:05,650
I'm in.

2855
01:41:05,730 --> 01:41:06,030
I'm in.

2856
01:41:06,450 --> 01:41:06,930
I'm in.

2857
01:41:11,890 --> 01:41:12,510
Nice, Doki.

2858
01:41:13,010 --> 01:41:13,950
Not nice anymore.

2859
01:41:14,250 --> 01:41:15,170
Not nice anymore!

2860
01:41:16,950 --> 01:41:19,430
How does that one hit not hit him off?

2861
01:41:19,770 --> 01:41:20,110
No!

2862
01:41:20,170 --> 01:41:21,310
It's up to Ditto!

2863
01:41:22,210 --> 01:41:23,010
Wait, no.

2864
01:41:23,090 --> 01:41:23,510
Ditto's dead.

2865
01:41:23,610 --> 01:41:23,790
Okay.

2866
01:41:24,430 --> 01:41:24,930
Nice.

2867
01:41:26,870 --> 01:41:28,590
Hey guys, I think...

2868
01:41:28,590 --> 01:41:30,190
Look, I got my one.

2869
01:41:30,430 --> 01:41:31,310
I got my...

2870
01:41:31,310 --> 01:41:32,570
Guys, I got my one.

2871
01:41:32,690 --> 01:41:33,810
What were you guys doing?

2872
01:41:33,930 --> 01:41:34,850
Who got their ones?

2873
01:41:35,830 --> 01:41:37,130
Uh, I got my five.

2874
01:41:37,410 --> 01:41:38,830
You did not get five.

2875
01:41:39,190 --> 01:41:42,310
Only two people fucking died in that entire time.

2876
01:41:43,250 --> 01:41:44,130
Yeah, I got five.

2877
01:41:44,350 --> 01:41:46,310
You didn't get five.

2878
01:41:46,450 --> 01:41:49,430
You missed my clutch guardian angel save.

2879
01:41:49,490 --> 01:41:50,730
No, that was amazing.

2880
01:41:51,210 --> 01:41:54,370
Yeah, but you guys died regardless so does it matter?

2881
01:41:55,330 --> 01:41:58,430
Listen, what's more important in life, saving someone or killing someone?

2882
01:41:58,630 --> 01:41:59,430
That's what I thought.

2883
01:41:59,630 --> 01:42:08,370
Well, if that person you're killing is gonna end up fucking like going to jail anyway for committing murder, then like killing them is a better deal.

2884
01:42:09,250 --> 01:42:10,290
You heard it here.

2885
01:42:10,390 --> 01:42:11,910
Doki thinks murder is justifiable.

2886
01:42:12,310 --> 01:42:14,250
Yeah, if you're murdering another murderer.

2887
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:28,980
If you guys stop and cry, if that person is gonna commit multiple murders and you murder them before they commit multiple murders, then it's justifiable.

2888
01:42:29,780 --> 01:42:31,540
It's like traveling back in time.

2889
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:35,300
What if that person was about to murder someone who murdered their child?

2890
01:42:36,140 --> 01:42:41,660
Well, what if that child grows up to commit more murders and he was like a time traveler?

2891
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:46,060
Yeah, I think that sounds logic.

2892
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:47,120
Yeah, that makes sense.

2893
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,280
Alright, you heard it here.

2894
01:42:49,420 --> 01:42:53,040
Doki said it's fine to murder children so they don't become mules.

2895
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:54,600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2896
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:57,100
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2897
01:42:57,180 --> 01:43:02,540
I'm saying that child We should kill all the children before they do anything.

2898
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:04,860
Therefore, there will be no problems.

2899
01:43:05,220 --> 01:43:09,380
I'm saying that murderer was a time traveler who knows the future of what that child's gonna do.

2900
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:12,620
It's like if you have the power to time travel, we travel back in time.

2901
01:43:12,620 --> 01:43:13,480
You know how your logic is flawed?

2902
01:43:13,740 --> 01:43:13,960
How?

2903
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:15,000
You know how your logic is flawed?

2904
01:43:15,140 --> 01:43:15,260
How?

2905
01:43:15,260 --> 01:43:17,520
Because if there's time travel, it would already happen by now.

2906
01:43:17,860 --> 01:43:18,940
Yeah, because it's a paradox.

2907
01:43:19,140 --> 01:43:23,720
What if they created a multiverse so that it drifts off to a separate multiverse?

2908
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:24,140
Multiverse!

2909
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:24,840
I love Marvel!

2910
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:28,700
Yo, someone pull the trigger.

2911
01:43:28,820 --> 01:43:29,520
I'm going in deep.

2912
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:30,440
Go, go in.

2913
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:30,860
Go with the bomb.

2914
01:43:31,060 --> 01:43:32,000
Oh, no, I'm stuck.

2915
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:32,840
I'm stuck.

2916
01:43:33,660 --> 01:43:34,380
Go in!

2917
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:35,820
Yeah.

2918
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:36,940
Get the easy!

2919
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:39,240
Okay, then we have to...

2920
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:39,840
Oh, they're here!

2921
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:40,160
They're here!

2922
01:43:40,220 --> 01:43:40,780
That fucking bomb!

2923
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,160
We gotta take them out!

2924
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:47,100
No!

2925
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:47,880
Hey, they're chucking!

2926
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:48,600
Oh, no!

2927
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:49,820
What happened?

2928
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:52,680
All of our stuff got destroyed.

2929
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:53,360
No!

2930
01:43:54,860 --> 01:43:57,340
We gotta make sure we got... I'm bringing the bombs over!

2931
01:43:57,700 --> 01:43:58,240
I'll be smacking them.

2932
01:43:58,280 --> 01:43:59,720
Just keep putting bombs in.

2933
01:44:00,040 --> 01:44:00,440
Yeah.

2934
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:05,420
Get the bombs!

2935
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:06,040
Oh my god!

2936
01:44:06,220 --> 01:44:06,640
Throw them off!

2937
01:44:06,700 --> 01:44:07,180
Throw them off!

2938
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:09,180
No!

2939
01:44:10,100 --> 01:44:10,800
Throw them off!

2940
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:15,620
Get over here.

2941
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:17,760
I made one bomb go off.

2942
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:18,820
I made one bomb go off.

2943
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:20,560
Drag him down!

2944
01:44:20,620 --> 01:44:21,440
Drag him down with me!

2945
01:44:21,480 --> 01:44:21,880
Whoa!

2946
01:44:22,340 --> 01:44:23,080
You're gonna die with me!

2947
01:44:23,580 --> 01:44:26,640
You're gonna die with me if it's the last thing I do!

2948
01:44:27,540 --> 01:44:28,020
Goodbye.

2949
01:44:28,900 --> 01:44:29,720
Oh my god.

2950
01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:32,340
I spawned back into my own base.

2951
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:34,580
Oh my god.

2952
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:36,700
Oh my god.

2953
01:44:37,900 --> 01:44:39,220
Get the bomb!

2954
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:39,640
Get the bomb!

2955
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:40,420
Go do it!

2956
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:41,960
Yeah!

2957
01:44:42,700 --> 01:44:43,340
I'm back.

2958
01:44:43,420 --> 01:44:43,820
I'm back.

2959
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:44,900
I'm bringing the bomb over.

2960
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:47,760
Oh, sweet.

2961
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:48,280
Sweet, sweet, sweet.

2962
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:48,440
That's me.

2963
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:48,880
That's me.

2964
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:51,900
Take him over!

2965
01:44:52,340 --> 01:44:52,540
No!

2966
01:44:52,820 --> 01:44:53,400
Oh, no.

2967
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:54,440
Whatever.

2968
01:44:54,660 --> 01:44:54,980
It's fine.

2969
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:55,420
He's over.

2970
01:44:55,500 --> 01:44:55,800
He's over.

2971
01:44:55,940 --> 01:44:57,440
I got crushed.

2972
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:00,420
Put the bombs in!

2973
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:00,940
Put the bombs in!

2974
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:01,120
We can!

2975
01:45:03,870 --> 01:45:04,410
I'm coming!

2976
01:45:04,530 --> 01:45:04,790
I'm coming!

2977
01:45:04,790 --> 01:45:05,090
I'm coming!

2978
01:45:06,250 --> 01:45:07,570
Oh, they sent two people over.

2979
01:45:07,930 --> 01:45:08,450
It's okay.

2980
01:45:08,530 --> 01:45:08,850
I'm back.

2981
01:45:13,260 --> 01:45:14,140
Okay, do the lever!

2982
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:14,580
Do the lever!

2983
01:45:14,640 --> 01:45:14,860
Quickly!

2984
01:45:15,060 --> 01:45:15,340
I'm trying!

2985
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:26,400
Ow!

2986
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:27,260
That's me, Ditto!

2987
01:45:27,340 --> 01:45:27,860
That's me!

2988
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:28,880
Ditto!

2989
01:45:28,940 --> 01:45:29,440
That's me!

2990
01:45:30,460 --> 01:45:30,840
Okay.

2991
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:34,180
Hey, we're not doing too good.

2992
01:45:34,380 --> 01:45:35,780
I got the bomb over!

2993
01:45:36,340 --> 01:45:37,920
Take the bomb and do it!

2994
01:45:38,120 --> 01:45:38,780
Come in!

2995
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:38,940
Oh,

2996
01:45:42,790 --> 01:45:43,650
he caught me with the bomb!

2997
01:45:44,690 --> 01:45:45,170
What

2998
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:56,560
did you guys do?

2999
01:45:58,060 --> 01:45:59,820
Uh, the bombs went off.

3000
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:01,760
Guys, are we?

3001
01:46:02,160 --> 01:46:03,040
I think we're out.

3002
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:05,080
I think we're out, guys.

3003
01:46:07,060 --> 01:46:08,080
Guys, we're not last.

3004
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:08,940
We got one win.

3005
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:10,120
We got one win.

3006
01:46:11,980 --> 01:46:12,460
No!

3007
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:15,060
I can't feed my kid!

3008
01:46:15,820 --> 01:46:16,300
No!

3009
01:46:17,540 --> 01:46:19,280
Poki's gonna kill my child!

3010
01:46:22,060 --> 01:46:22,600
Poki's gonna kill my child!

3011
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:23,860
Your future child.

3012
01:46:30,420 --> 01:46:33,720
Look, we're not last because we won one game.

3013
01:46:34,240 --> 01:46:42,040
Yeah, we got that very first game and then we got high egos and then we failed miserably the rest of the time.

3014
01:46:42,140 --> 01:46:42,540
I'm working!

3015
01:46:46,680 --> 01:46:49,680
We did the best we could.

3016
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:51,080
We did the best we could.

3017
01:46:52,150 --> 01:46:54,340
For every winner, there has to be a loser.

3018
01:46:54,340 --> 01:46:55,160
Wait, starting map three?

3019
01:46:55,990 --> 01:46:56,940
Oh, wait.

3020
01:46:57,260 --> 01:46:58,200
One to one.

3021
01:46:58,440 --> 01:46:58,840
Yes.

3022
01:46:59,660 --> 01:47:01,420
One to one.

3023
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:03,740
Poki!

3024
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:08,520
Question mark?

3025
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:12,300
Question mark?

3026
01:47:20,120 --> 01:47:20,840
Poki!

3027
01:47:31,980 --> 01:47:36,400
These guys on the enemy team don't know what the fuck's going on.

3028
01:47:53,750 --> 01:47:55,430
I'm like Rumpelstiltskin.

3029
01:47:57,290 --> 01:47:58,310
Oh my god!

3030
01:48:01,860 --> 01:48:02,580
It's okay.

3031
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:06,580
It's all about the friends we made along the way.

3032
01:48:06,940 --> 01:48:08,020
Yeah, oh my god.

3033
01:48:09,220 --> 01:48:09,720
Yeah.

3034
01:48:10,940 --> 01:48:11,440
Yeah.

3035
01:48:12,020 --> 01:48:21,840
I'm so excited now in the future if someone asks me to play, I could just say oh yeah, no, we won some games on Twitch Rivals and I can lie even more about my resume.

3036
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:22,600
I'm so excited.

3037
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:24,960
I got to play with the legendary Pussy Slayer.

3038
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:25,360
Yeah.

3039
01:48:25,980 --> 01:48:32,560
I got my Warp Scepter during all this.

3040
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:33,140
That's a dub.

3041
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:34,720
It's okay.

3042
01:48:35,180 --> 01:48:37,680
In the end, everybody gets money.

3043
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:42,660
Everybody gets money and that's what it's all about.

3044
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:43,840
That's right!

3045
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:45,260
That's right!

3046
01:48:45,700 --> 01:48:47,460
Everybody wins something.

3047
01:48:47,980 --> 01:48:49,380
That's all that matters.

3048
01:48:50,260 --> 01:48:51,360
Exactly, guys.

3049
01:48:51,980 --> 01:48:54,320
GG is everybody.

3050
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:56,540
What a journey.

3051
01:48:57,020 --> 01:48:57,840
Okay, GG.

3052
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:02,080
There's been a team that lost every game and that's not our team.

3053
01:49:02,300 --> 01:49:05,360
Yeah, but they still were in the quarterfinals.

3054
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:05,960
That's not our team.

3055
01:49:06,120 --> 01:49:07,380
That's not our team.

3056
01:49:07,420 --> 01:49:09,340
There was a team that lost every game.

3057
01:49:10,720 --> 01:49:11,920
But that wasn't us.

3058
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:14,180
Okay, that's all that matters.

3059
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:17,140
That's all that matters.

3060
01:49:18,340 --> 01:49:19,560
GG is everybody.

3061
01:49:20,580 --> 01:49:21,140
GG.

3062
01:49:22,260 --> 01:49:24,780
Good luck with the rest of your day, guys.

3063
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:25,580
See you next time.

3064
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:26,220
Bye-bye.

3065
01:49:27,260 --> 01:49:27,780
Alright.

3066
01:49:30,280 --> 01:49:31,560
I had a great time.

3067
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:35,040
I had a fun time with everyone.

3068
01:49:37,340 --> 01:49:42,600
It was honestly a huge blast playing with this team.

3069
01:49:42,860 --> 01:49:44,860
And we had a fun time with this team as well.

3070
01:49:45,940 --> 01:49:47,180
There's been some...

3071
01:49:47,180 --> 01:49:50,580
I feel like on Twitch, things just get much more cursed in general.

3072
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:54,940
It's just the Twitch life.

3073
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:55,240
.

3074
01:49:58,820 --> 01:49:59,420
.

3075
01:49:59,420 --> 01:50:00,000
Anyway, guys.

3076
01:50:00,580 --> 01:50:01,440
It's okay.

3077
01:50:01,540 --> 01:50:02,900
We won our first game.

3078
01:50:03,140 --> 01:50:04,280
That's all that matters.

3079
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:07,980
It's all about the adventures and the fun we had.

3080
01:50:08,300 --> 01:50:08,900
.

3081
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:10,160
.

3082
01:50:12,160 --> 01:50:14,220
Hey, guys.

3083
01:50:14,460 --> 01:50:17,100
We do have another stream tonight, everybody.

3084
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:21,860
Look, I was not the dead weight.

3085
01:50:21,860 --> 01:50:24,760
I did some clutch shit.

3086
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:26,400
That's all I'm saying.

3087
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:27,040
.

3088
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:32,880
I pulled off my ones.

3089
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:34,660
I did my ones.

3090
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:39,560
I defended so well during the trebuchet moment.

3091
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:40,340
.

3092
01:50:40,340 --> 01:50:47,780
I fucking defended it so hard during the trebuchet and sent bombs over and everything.

3093
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:49,840
Like, bro, come on.

3094
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:50,480
.

3095
01:50:51,860 --> 01:50:53,280
I went full...

3096
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:58,800
I fucking beat up the goalie and I scored like four goals.

3097
01:50:59,060 --> 01:50:59,480
.

3098
01:51:02,180 --> 01:51:06,300
All you did is punch the goal.

3099
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:09,320
And I did my one.

3100
01:51:09,540 --> 01:51:10,860
I did my one.

3101
01:51:11,540 --> 01:51:11,940
Okay?

3102
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:16,320
And I sent the bombs over.

3103
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:20,240
What they did with the bombs was their job.

3104
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:23,060
Like, I said I sent the bombs over.

3105
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:25,780
They had to finish the job.

3106
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:27,040
.

3107
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:30,180
.

3108
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:33,820
I did my 50% of the work.

3109
01:51:34,700 --> 01:51:35,540
.

3110
01:51:36,780 --> 01:51:37,620
.

3111
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:38,580
.

3112
01:51:38,580 --> 01:51:40,920
I was sending bombs out.

3113
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:43,480
I did... Okay.

3114
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:45,180
That is not true.

3115
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:48,800
At best, I was the 80% at that point.

3116
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:49,840
.

3117
01:51:51,860 --> 01:51:51,900
.

3118
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:57,080
.

3119
01:51:58,240 --> 01:51:58,760
.

3120
01:51:58,760 --> 01:51:59,020
.

3121
01:51:59,020 --> 01:51:59,040
.

3122
01:51:59,040 --> 01:51:59,060
.

3123
01:51:59,060 --> 01:51:59,080
.

3124
01:51:59,080 --> 01:51:59,100
.

3125
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:01,240
.

3126
01:52:01,240 --> 01:52:01,260
.

3127
01:52:04,100 --> 01:52:04,620
.

3128
01:52:06,980 --> 01:52:07,500
.

3129
01:52:11,640 --> 01:52:12,160
.

3130
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:12,780
I was the defender.

3131
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:15,860
I was fucking sending bombs over.

3132
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:26,340
I was carrying the bombs over and then I sent it over and then I... and then Bree had to do the defense for the other bombs.

3133
01:52:26,860 --> 01:52:29,920
Mr. Lane Robbins was the carry.

3134
01:52:30,240 --> 01:52:31,300
What is this?

3135
01:52:31,340 --> 01:52:33,040
You're supposed to be my echo chamber.

3136
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:34,640
What the fuck is this?

3137
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:35,860
Anyway, guys.

3138
01:52:36,060 --> 01:52:39,420
I had a great time with everybody.

3139
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:40,080
.

3140
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:41,720
I had a great time with my team.

3141
01:52:42,160 --> 01:52:44,000
For those who are new here.

3142
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:46,060
Also, thank you for the .

3143
01:52:46,060 --> 01:52:50,060
I'm just about to end today because we just finished Twitch Rivals.

3144
01:52:51,060 --> 01:52:52,120
Anyway, guys.

3145
01:52:52,220 --> 01:52:55,760
If you're new here, I usually stream on the YouTube.

3146
01:52:56,060 --> 01:52:58,040
So, please check me out.

3147
01:52:58,420 --> 01:52:59,780
Doki Bird YouTube.

3148
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:01,660
That's where I usually stream.

3149
01:53:01,700 --> 01:53:02,540
I actually have a stream tonight.

3150
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:07,120
I'll be speaking Chinese tonight on YouTube with Hiro.

3151
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:10,560
She's fluent and I'm not.

3152
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:11,400
.

3153
01:53:12,620 --> 01:53:14,800
She actually knows how to read and write.

3154
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:15,800
I don't know either.

3155
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:19,680
Anyway, if you want to support me via other means, please check out my merch.

3156
01:53:19,980 --> 01:53:25,960
And if you want to know when I stream on Twitch, I usually tweet out when I'm streaming on Twitch on Twitter.

3157
01:53:26,060 --> 01:53:27,560
So, please follow me on Twitter.

3158
01:53:28,460 --> 01:53:29,140
What else?

3159
01:53:29,220 --> 01:53:29,480
What else?

3160
01:53:29,580 --> 01:53:29,800
What else?

3161
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:30,580
Also, Friday.

3162
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:32,500
There's going to be a slight change in the schedule on Friday.

3163
01:53:32,700 --> 01:53:38,420
I will be playing Marvel Rivals because I actually got invited to the Alpha test.

3164
01:53:38,620 --> 01:53:41,120
I knew tweeting that out was a good idea.

3165
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:42,140
But, yeah.

3166
01:53:42,160 --> 01:53:52,780
A person who knows the community manager reached out to me and said that they wanted to send me a code to try out Marvel Rivals on Friday.

3167
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:58,020
And they were possibly... I might be like...

3168
01:53:58,020 --> 01:53:58,920
I don't know what it's called.

3169
01:53:59,080 --> 01:54:00,000
Let me read what they said.

3170
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:05,160
They want to make me one of the official content creators for Marvel Rivals.

3171
01:54:05,340 --> 01:54:06,060
I'm not sure yet.

3172
01:54:06,420 --> 01:54:11,060
But maybe I'll find out later today because they said they want to give me more details about it.

3173
01:54:11,620 --> 01:54:12,140
But, yeah.

3174
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:12,940
Anyway, guys.

3175
01:54:13,020 --> 01:54:14,280
As always, everybody stay hydrated.

3176
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:16,220
Pause, check up, and move around to get that blood flowing.

3177
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:19,340
And when you stay up from me, head to bed because you deserve it.

3178
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:20,460
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3179
01:54:20,920 --> 01:54:21,780
Bye, guys.

3180
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:22,920
Bye.
