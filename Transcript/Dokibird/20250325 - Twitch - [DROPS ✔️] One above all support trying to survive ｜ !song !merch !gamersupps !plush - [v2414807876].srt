1
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,830
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:52,650
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,090
It's been a bit, guys.

4
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,950
Yes, it's been a while since I've been on Twitch, ever since the incident.

5
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:06,230
People never thought they'd see me back here, but here I am.

6
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:13,110
There was one thing, one company, one game that brought me back to Twitch.

7
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,850
Also, I did not realize it was my partner anniversary.

8
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,890
What fucking timing, guys.

9
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:24,770
So the reason why I am back here, I never thought, you know, it's been a while since I was last here.

10
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:38,470
But, I'll be here again for quite a bit, because I have a little partnership with Marvel Rivals.

11
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:45,910
And this partnership requires me to stream an X amount of hours per month of Marvel Rivals.

12
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:53,710
And because I have to do that, I've decided to do it on Twitch, because it's just easier.

13
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,490
It's just easier.

14
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,330
Whenever I have the time, I will be doing that.

15
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:08,170
Just be like, you know, just be like, whenever I do have some time for it, I'll be here on Twitch to stream some Marvel Rivals.

16
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:13,890
And that was the only reason why I'm back here on Twitch, because it's just much more convenient than streaming it on YouTube.

17
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,290
Because I don't like doing, like, super gorilla streams.

18
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:22,830
Also, like, when it comes to rank, I don't like streaming it on YouTube if it's like super gorilla stream.

19
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,550
Because, like, anything can happen in Marvel Rivals rank.

20
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,910
Also, I've not played Marvel Rivals in a bit, actually.

21
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:35,690
The last time I played Marvel Rivals was the 18th, so it has been a while.

22
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,310
It has been a while, so I am very rusty and I am on the main account.

23
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:45,830
If things do go bad, I'll be going on an alt account, because I do want to make sure I get the hours in.

24
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,810
But, I'm going to try not to make it too much of a long stream.

25
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,910
Yes, I know, it's very late.

26
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,410
It's very, very late.

27
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,750
Look, today was a little bit of a busy day.

28
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,410
I'll talk about this on YouTube as well.

29
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,790
I'll repeat this on YouTube.

30
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,390
But basically, I started the day off in this morning.

31
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,790
Finally, after four plus years, I have a family doctor.

32
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,890
You must be thinking, Yoki, what the fuck do you mean, four plus years?

33
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:20,510
Well, when I came back to Canada, I didn't have a family doctor anymore.

34
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:25,650
And then my parents sort of never tried to get me a family doctor.

35
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,810
So they would just be like, just get these off-the-counter medications.

36
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,130
You know, you'll get better.

37
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:38,670
I never had the chance to actually have a doctor doctor.

38
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:52,870
Also, where I live is, after COVID, it is incredibly hard to get a doctor, to be a patient.

39
00:04:52,870 --> 00:05:04,450
If you don't have a family doctor before COVID, you are barely ever going to get a family doctor after COVID.

40
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,130
Because we have a shortage of doctors.

41
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:15,790
The doctor I went to today was a 20-minute Uber drive.

42
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:22,870
Because it was the only place that was taking new patients.

43
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,850
That was taking new clients, new patients as a family doctor.

44
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:33,090
Everywhere near me, walking distance, driving distance, was like, we're not taking walk-ins.

45
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:39,630
There's no doctors in Canada right now, where I live, that's taking walk-ins, by the way.

46
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,350
Like, nobody's taking that.

47
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,790
Like, you have to make an appointment to get a walk-in.

48
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,270
Which defeats the purpose of walk-ins.

49
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:59,750
Anyway, and even then, it's incredibly hard to do so.

50
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,970
Anyway, so, there's this specific website.

51
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:11,250
There's a specific website that tells you when a new clinic, whenever a clinic is accepting new patients.

52
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,710
And a couple of days ago, I was looking through that website.

53
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,750
Because I was like, you know what, I'm going to do it.

54
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,470
Like, my throat has been pretty messed up for a long time.

55
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,030
So, it has not been recovering for a while.

56
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,110
So, I'm going to do it.

57
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,860
And then, so, I looked at the list, and it was crazy.

58
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:34,040
There's so many, there's only three clinics in the entire area I'm in.

59
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:41,040
Within a 30-minute driving distance, there were only three clinics that was taking new patients.

60
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,440
I was looking, I was like, there's no fucking way.

61
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:53,560
And then, there was like this blog that was like, this clinic is now not even taking waiting lists.

62
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:59,100
And I was like, what the f- Like, there's some clinics that aren't even letting people add themselves on a waiting list.

63
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,100
They're like, their waiting lists have now closed.

64
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,060
And shit like that.

65
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,140
And I was like, Jesus fucking- It's a problem.

66
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,420
Anyway, so, today I finally got a family doctor.

67
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,320
It is a- I need to get my care card renewed as well.

68
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,860
Because I have to pay up front.

69
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,080
Because I haven't been to a doctor in four plus years.

70
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,520
My parents never renewed my care card for like ten plus years.

71
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:37,060
My care card has been expired for ten plus years.

72
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,020
So, like, I need to renew my care card too, as well.

73
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,320
So, my parents have never renewed it.

74
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,700
So, I have to deal with that as well.

75
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,640
And so, like, I have to pay up front.

76
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,740
I have to pay, like, a lot.

77
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:05,080
Because I- But then, like, the thing is, when I went to the doctor, she was like- She's a new doctor, by the way.

78
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:16,800
She literally got her- finished her trial- I don't remember what- I don't know doctor terms, but- She finished her, like, trials or whatever her, like, last year.

79
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,360
So, she's new new.

80
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,720
Yes, her residency.

81
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,340
She finished her residency last year.

82
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,900
So, she's new new.

83
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:34,720
So, that's why I was able to- That was the only way to, like, grab an actual family doctor.

84
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:42,000
Anyway, she was like- She, like, examined my chest, like, blood pressure, heart rate, throat.

85
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,420
And she was like, there's nothing wrong with you physically right now.

86
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:51,480
And I was like, but I've been- But she was just like, you've just been, like, back to back to back to back sick.

87
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,900
For too long.

88
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,960
Like, your throat is okay.

89
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,060
You've just been, like- You've just had, like, a really really rough time.

90
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,900
So, like, I can't really do anything.

91
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,840
Unless you want to get a blood test done.

92
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,080
And then, like, we can look over your blood test results and see how it goes.

93
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,160
And other than that, just get some vitamins in you.

94
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,400
And, like, maybe get a- Like, what's a Deflem spray and stuff.

95
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,880
And I was like, oh, is there anything you can prescribe?

96
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,320
And then she was like, no.

97
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,040
And I was like, no, not really.

98
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,740
You can get these off the counter stuff.

99
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,460
Okay, she was much more professional with the way she said it.

100
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,920
She said it a lot more professional.

101
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,080
But, like, how I interpret it was that she's just like, no.

102
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,200
And I said, is there anything you can prescribe so I can get better?

103
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,720
And she was like, not really, no.

104
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:51,480
Just gargle some saline water and maybe get Deflem spray and everything.

105
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,380
And then maybe you just need rest.

106
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:58,180
And you've just been back-to-back sick for so long that your throat just needs a lot.

107
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,560
And I was like, but I've been resting for a month plus now since the last time I got sick.

108
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,780
She's like, yeah, but you have been sick for more than half a year.

109
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,720
So you might need more time.

110
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,820
And I was like, okay.

111
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:11,940
Okay.

112
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,220
Okay.

113
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,980
I don't know what else to do.

114
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,280
But, yeah, acts of Valentine.

115
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,620
Thank you for the tier one sub.

116
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,700
Thank you, thank you.

117
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,220
So, yeah, it's just...

118
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,080
I'm gonna try and rest up a little bit, I guess.

119
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,760
You might look at my schedule.

120
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,740
It is a little bare.

121
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,920
I'm gonna try not to overdo it as always.

122
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,460
It's just my throat.

123
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,160
Like, basically, I'm just...

124
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,460
Sometimes I might still cough a little bit or my throat...

125
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,600
Like, it feels like my throat is like going through...

126
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,640
It feels like I'm going through puberty as a teenage boy.

127
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,860
But, like, it'll get there soon.

128
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,160
It'll be okay.

129
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:01,220
But, yes, I am streaming Marvel Rivals tonight.

130
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,000
But, anyway, yes, when I got back from the doctor.

131
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,920
Like, you know, my fucking 20-minute Uber ride back home.

132
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,780
I went...

133
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:15,180
I took a nap and, like, napped for, like, four plus hours.

134
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,420
So, I'm okay now.

135
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,460
I'm not as tired.

136
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,400
I am a little tired.

137
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,840
But, like, because I know I'm sort of a, like...

138
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,020
I know I'm playing Marvel Rivals.

139
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,360
So, I am a little tired.

140
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,080
But, other than that, I hope things will be okay.

141
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,100
FistfulVerbs, thank you for the 100 bitties.

142
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,020
Thank you, thank you.

143
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,760
Not sure how much I can watch today's stream.

144
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,140
I hope the games are alright today.

145
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,000
Hope you feel better soon.

146
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,460
Thank you, I really appreciate it.

147
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,440
Thank you for the bitties.

148
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,440
White, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

149
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,960
Zane, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

150
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,840
Thank you, thank you.

151
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,700
And Medi, thank you for the bitties.

152
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,460
Thank you, thank you.

153
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,160
Yes, so, yeah, I'm back.

154
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,380
I might try to revamp my Twitch thing a bit.

155
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,540
Because I haven't touched...

156
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,840
I haven't really touched my Twitch profile stuff.

157
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,200
So, it does look...

158
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,500
Like, it does look pretty...

159
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,280
Pretty old.

160
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,740
But, I'll think about...

161
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,680
I'll deal with that later.

162
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,180
Anyway, I'm going to do a quick play warm-up.

163
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:07,720
I haven't played...

164
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,440
I haven't played in...

165
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,780
Like I said, I haven't played in...

166
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,380
I think, like, almost a week now.

167
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,760
So, I definitely need...

168
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,200
I definitely need a warm-up a little bit.

169
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,700
If games get bad, I'm going on an ulti count.

170
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,340
I have a Celestial 1 ulti count.

171
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,640
So, I'm just going to go on there.

172
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,300
If things get really fucking bad.

173
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,640
But, yeah, it's my party anniversary.

174
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,500
Yippee!

175
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,340
Um...

176
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,740
But, to be fair, I feel like I've been...

177
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,960
Becoming more and more...

178
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,480
I'm going to play Syla.

179
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,680
I'm becoming more and more productive...

180
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,000
Over the course...

181
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,160
The last two weeks...

182
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,680
I've been so incredibly productive...

183
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,460
Compared to the last...

184
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,080
Two months.

185
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,960
It's actually crazy.

186
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:55,800
Although...

187
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,080
The doctor was like...

188
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,660
Because I was like...

189
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,120
What kind of vitamins should I get?

190
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,160
Um...

191
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,380
Should I get to help out?

192
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,900
Like, do you have anything specific?

193
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,820
And she was like...

194
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,160
Yeah, I'll get some zinc in you.

195
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,960
And vitamin C.

196
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:06,720
I already have...

197
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,200
I'm actually like...

198
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,720
Um...

199
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,940
Because my vitamin C is a Chihuahua.

200
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,200
But I did buy some zinc as well.

201
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,880
I think that's for like...

202
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,420
Blood, right?

203
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,360
I'm pretty sure.

204
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,740
Let me warm up with Syla.

205
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,400
A character I don't play in ranked.

206
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:22,820
Tired tonight?

207
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,800
I'm a little tired.

208
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,880
Now I realize why I'm tired so often.

209
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,160
Because, like...

210
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,160
I grew...

211
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,920
I literally grew up drinking caffeine.

212
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:33,920
Like...

213
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,290
I'm so fucked.

214
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,120
I'm finally...

215
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,180
Everything makes so much more sense now.

216
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:46,220
I literally grew up drinking fucking caffeine as a child.

217
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,200
And now I'm here.

218
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,180
I'm just gonna take the vitamins everyday.

219
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,720
That's really it.

220
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,720
Everything makes sense now.

221
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,540
Where are they?

222
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,140
I don't know if I should...

223
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,320
Oh my god.

224
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,280
I definitely needed to warm up.

225
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,000
Oh no!

226
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,320
Scarlet!

227
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,180
No!

228
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,400
My counter!

229
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,080
She can just left click me!

230
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,720
Holy shit!

231
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,500
Guys, I have no...

232
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,420
Guys, look.

233
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,580
Please understand.

234
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,460
I have not aimed at all for a long time.

235
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,900
Guys, I will admit that I do feel incredibly wired.

236
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,700
Gosh, right now.

237
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:39,040
I have not aimed in a long time.

238
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,240
This would be...

239
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:41,900
It's okay!

240
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,200
Oh my god.

241
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,600
I already feel...

242
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,120
I'm like, how do you...

243
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,200
How...

244
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,880
How do you aim?

245
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,180
Let me stand back here.

246
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,820
I don't know what I'm doing.

247
00:14:59,820 --> 00:14:59,880
What?

248
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,780
No.

249
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,620
It's not fair.

250
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,920
How do you aim?

251
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:07,880
Aim how?

252
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,220
Work.

253
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,980
This is not fair.

254
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,900
Why they protect their support?

255
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,960
I don't even get that.

256
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,860
What the fuck?

257
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,740
Oh my god.

258
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,140
I didn't see him.

259
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,680
Oh.

260
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,740
I feel so rusty.

261
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,760
Oh my god.

262
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,060
I might have to swap off Zylok.

263
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,360
No.

264
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,780
She's my best DPS character too.

265
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,800
If I can't even pull this off.

266
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,760
Oh my god.

267
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,400
I'm just gonna stay here.

268
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,240
Let me just tickle him from up here.

269
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,980
I'll just tickle him.

270
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,060
Let me just tickle him.

271
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,220
I know I am a tickle monster.

272
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,300
I'm too scared.

273
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,370
I'm too scared.

274
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,180
Oh my god.

275
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,480
I'm sorry.

276
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,540
I'm sorry.

277
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,340
I'm on your team.

278
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,800
I am the tick...

279
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,780
They call me...

280
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,120
Oh shit.

281
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,300
Okay.

282
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,780
They call me the tickler.

283
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,320
Cause I don't...

284
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:19,780
What?

285
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,240
Okay.

286
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,820
That's fine.

287
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,320
Oh shit.

288
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:25,640
No.

289
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,020
Okay.

290
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,920
Not fine.

291
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:29,960
Wait.

292
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:30,920
We have a disappear.

293
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,020
Nice.

294
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:33,340
Okay.

295
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,420
Wow.

296
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,900
Oh no.

297
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:36,920
That's not fair.

298
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,500
I literally just got here.

299
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,300
What?

300
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,600
And I'm the only one that dies?

301
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,480
Okay.

302
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,620
That's okay.

303
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,840
I know what to do.

304
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,560
This is my...

305
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,660
I'm worse on this character, but I know what to do.

306
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,900
This is my...

307
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,340
I'm worse on this character, but it's okay.

308
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,940
Can't be that bad, right?

309
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,680
Oh my god.

310
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,380
My eyes...

311
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:06,780
You know...

312
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,120
I know when I'm like tired.

313
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,020
When my eyes...

314
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,820
Like, I can't focus my eyes right now and stuff.

315
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,560
When you're getting cross-eyed, that's when you sort of know that you're like tired.

316
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,760
That's like me right now.

317
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,400
I'm fucking cross-eyed right now.

318
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,740
Oh my god.

319
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,460
What the fuck?

320
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:29,840
There we go.

321
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,380
Don't worry, I'm a hero.

322
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,760
Don't worry, I'm a hero.

323
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,820
Don't worry, I'm a fucking hero.

324
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,920
That's fucking right.

325
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,600
Hero time!

326
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,860
Oh my god, what am I doing?

327
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,160
I saw this in Marble Rivals Invitational.

328
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,480
I can be just as good, clearly.

329
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,320
Oh my god, I saw this in Marble Rivals Invitational.

330
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,040
I think I can do the same thing.

331
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,320
I think so.

332
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,500
It's okay.

333
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,240
I just poke.

334
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:13,700
I feel like I should be flanking, but like, I can't.

335
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:15,940
I don't...

336
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,320
Yeah, I do not trust myself.

337
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,560
You see, this is exactly why.

338
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,080
Guys.

339
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,680
This is exactly why I was not playing.

340
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,320
I don't think.

341
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,060
Oh my god, the fuck are you doing?

342
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,180
Crazy.

343
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,160
Where are you?

344
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,440
It's okay, I have my ult.

345
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,300
Guys, look!

346
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,380
I'm hitting shots!

347
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,920
Guys, look at that!

348
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,860
I am so fucking low HP.

349
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,180
Okay, look, I've seen this.

350
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,260
Oh, they saw me.

351
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:51,520
Fuck.

352
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,340
Okay, nevermind.

353
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,940
I guess I go down now.

354
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:55,840
Okay.

355
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,260
I'm doing it.

356
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,140
I'm doing it.

357
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,320
I'm doing it, guys.

358
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,620
I'm doing like point and click adventure.

359
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,420
Oh, fuck!

360
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:06,680
Okay.

361
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,420
Okay, that's fine.

362
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,320
Point and click adventure.

363
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:10,980
I'm doing it.

364
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,060
Oh my god, you're such a whore.

365
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,380
Nobody loves you.

366
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,800
If you're doing this in quick play, nobody fucking loves you.

367
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,600
Alright, see, this is how you die.

368
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,400
Okay, look at that.

369
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,380
I'm hitting buttons.

370
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,260
I'm doing it.

371
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,960
I'm just hitting.

372
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,940
Oh, I'm okay.

373
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,620
Don't.

374
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,840
Don't leave me alone.

375
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:43,880
Leave me alone.

376
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:44,820
Don't!

377
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,760
Please.

378
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,740
Leave me alone.

379
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,240
I'm not...

380
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,760
I have five kills.

381
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:53,860
Leave me...

382
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,920
All I do is farm damage.

383
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,440
Leave me the fuck alone.

384
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,180
All I do is just farm.

385
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:03,280
Just farm.

386
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,740
Oh, you're such a whore.

387
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,570
Jesus Christ.

388
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,290
Wait, there's none of them are pushing cart.

389
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,690
I mean, that's fine by me.

390
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,910
I'm okay with that.

391
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,170
Get this clones out.

392
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:24,450
All I do is...

393
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,250
Oh, fuck!

394
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:26,810
Oh, shit!

395
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,870
Okay, please, please, please.

396
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,250
Please, I'm missing shots.

397
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:32,550
Not her though.

398
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,670
Not him too.

399
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:38,630
Nice.

400
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:39,690
All right, there you go.

401
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:40,230
Nice.

402
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:42,010
From five to eight, I'll take those.

403
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:43,950
I'll take those.

404
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:44,870
All right.

405
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,070
I'm glad my team is carrying me.

406
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:48,890
I'm just...

407
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:49,410
This is...

408
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,530
I think this is good aim practice right now.

409
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,950
I think like Hella is literally just point and click adventure.

410
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,250
Like anybody can be a good Hella.

411
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,770
And then you guys are gonna be like little assholes and be like, why aren't you anybody?

412
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:05,230
Anybody that's a DPS player can be a good Hella player.

413
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:10,250
I think she's like such an easy character to like learn.

414
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:11,910
Because it's literally just...

415
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:16,590
It's literally just you aim and then you hit him and then they're dead.

416
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,410
Like that's basically it.

417
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,450
Like if you can aim, you can play Hella.

418
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,790
What the fuck?

419
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:26,910
Okay.

420
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:32,130
Okay.

421
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,970
If he's having fun, why?

422
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,310
Just let him have fun.

423
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,350
Just let him have fun.

424
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,290
Great magic trick though.

425
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,030
I really enjoyed that magic trick that they did.

426
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:52,850
All right, nice.

427
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:53,510
Yay!

428
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:55,750
Let's go!

429
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,610
Oh shit, no shit.

430
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:02,750
Come on, point and click.

431
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,790
That should be everybody, right?

432
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:05,650
Who's still alive?

433
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:07,630
Yay!

434
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,430
Good job on that, Strange.

435
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,630
Okay, but try... look, I'm not TTK.

436
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:21,290
I think he's literally the only controller player that's like high E.

437
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:25,490
Like it's crazy that he can play like that with a controller.

438
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:27,810
Suddenly 14 kills.

439
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:28,490
Look at that!

440
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:33,090
Okay, I feel like I definitely wasted my time playing Psylocke.

441
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:40,910
I for sure wasted my time trying to play Psylocke.

442
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,910
Oh, my aim.

443
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,490
I'm not warmed up, guys.

444
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,410
My aim is still waking up.

445
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:47,570
Okay, we'll do one more.

446
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,550
We'll do one more game and then we'll go to the rank.

447
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,610
And then we'll get flamed, I guess.

448
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:56,590
We'll get flamed.

449
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,470
I can't wait.

450
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:02,150
I can't wait to get flamed, guys.

451
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,450
Let's try Psylocke again.

452
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:06,650
Maybe it'll be different.

453
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,850
Guys, it could be different, guys.

454
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,290
I'm slowly waking up, I am.

455
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,530
I'm very slowly waking up.

456
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:17,930
Guys, it's gonna be different this time.

457
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,970
I'm like more awake now, I swear to God.

458
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:25,770
I swear to God, it's gonna be so different.

459
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,110
I can do this.

460
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,830
I believe.

461
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,260
Guys, do you believe?

462
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,360
If I lose, it's because none of you guys believed in me.

463
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,120
Woo!

464
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,500
Okay, on this map.

465
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,700
It's fine.

466
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,840
I'll just play health pack.

467
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,120
I guess.

468
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,240
With Adam?

469
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,680
That's fine, guys.

470
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,620
Guys, I...

471
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,130
Guys, it'll still be fine.

472
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:00,930
I...

473
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,610
Oh, one of them left.

474
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,130
One of them actually...

475
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,220
They're like...

476
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,190
No.

477
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:08,910
No.

478
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,230
Yeah, it's fine.

479
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,470
Everything will be fine.

480
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,590
It'll be okay.

481
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:18,190
They just...

482
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,550
They saw our lineup and was just like...

483
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,010
No.

484
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,670
Oh, and look.

485
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,610
We got two healers, at least.

486
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,110
Guys, it's getting that bad.

487
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,390
We got two.

488
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,250
Two guys.

489
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:37,390
Oh, shit.

490
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:38,770
What the fuck?

491
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:39,270
Where am I?

492
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,370
Oh, I missed it.

493
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,430
I missed the die.

494
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,350
I missed the fucking...

495
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,270
Whoops.

496
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,890
Who the fuck doesn't break this?

497
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,410
Wait, that's crazy.

498
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,890
He didn't break that.

499
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,510
Oh, my God.

500
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,770
I can't fucking right-click anymore.

501
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:02,690
My aim.

502
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,710
Oh, my God.

503
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,230
My aim.

504
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,470
I can't right-click.

505
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,310
Guys, it's okay.

506
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,710
I can left-click, guys.

507
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,970
I was distraction for my team.

508
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,470
It's okay.

509
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:20,990
I was distraction.

510
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,930
Guys, don't judge my right-click.

511
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,410
My left-click was really, really good, though.

512
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:27,430
Like, but...

513
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,170
What about my right-click, though?

514
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,050
Wait, my left-click.

515
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:30,910
Sorry, I can't...

516
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:31,870
I don't know my left and right.

517
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:32,970
My...

518
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:35,850
My...

519
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,170
Okay, but like...

520
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:39,390
You gotta admit.

521
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,090
Oh, my God.

522
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,150
Oh, shit.

523
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:46,650
No!

524
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:47,490
I had to reload!

525
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,250
I had to reload!

526
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,410
Oh, my God.

527
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:54,730
Sad.

528
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:56,910
Sad.

529
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:57,730
It's okay.

530
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:58,210
It's okay.

531
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,090
I was distraction.

532
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:00,250
Look at that.

533
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:03,050
Every time I distracted, my team gets kills.

534
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,970
That's how I cope at night.

535
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:08,950
Every...

536
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:11,030
Guys, every time...

537
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,290
If you think about it.

538
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,990
Every time I died, my team gets 20 kills.

539
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,810
My death is like basically worth it.

540
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:20,850
Guys.

541
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:23,830
Jesus Christ, I almost missed that.

542
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,310
Look at that.

543
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,490
Each death gives us four kills.

544
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:29,190
You're welcome, team.

545
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,650
You're welcome.

546
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:36,310
Okay, can I get anything here?

547
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:37,550
Oh, my God.

548
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:38,030
It's okay.

549
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:39,430
It's okay.

550
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,310
Guys, it was not useless.

551
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:42,930
Like I said.

552
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,170
Every time I die.

553
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,630
And when I'm alive, we get kills.

554
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,130
Guys, I am helping.

555
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,130
Look how helpful I've been.

556
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,890
Look how helpful I am being.

557
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:00,930
Wow.

558
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,190
Where am I?

559
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,210
Oh, my God.

560
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,090
I'm so helpful.

561
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,290
Look at that.

562
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,070
Where did he go?

563
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:15,430
Oh, shit.

564
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:15,870
He missed.

565
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:16,370
See?

566
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:18,290
At least I didn't miss my ult.

567
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:19,370
Guys.

568
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,890
I didn't miss my ult.

569
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:23,990
It's the little things.

570
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,310
I'm so helpful.

571
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,010
It's the little things in life.

572
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:29,670
Guys.

573
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,230
It truly is.

574
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:33,430
Where's my team?

575
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:35,850
Let me just...

576
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:36,870
Let me not.

577
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,390
Oh, shit.

578
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:39,310
Oh, fuck.

579
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,530
Oh, my God.

580
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,190
Oh, eat him.

581
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:45,690
Oh, thank God.

582
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,050
Wait.

583
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,390
Okay, I was gonna say, but wait.

584
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,150
What about me?

585
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:49,210
What about me?

586
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,190
Okay, that's fine.

587
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:53,910
That's fine.

588
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:55,690
Where are they?

589
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:58,910
Guys, it's okay.

590
00:27:59,070 --> 00:27:59,210
See?

591
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:00,510
Look at that.

592
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,650
Look, I'm doing it.

593
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,150
Look at that.

594
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:04,870
I am doing...

595
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:05,650
Oh, you think you can...

596
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:06,370
Oh, fuck.

597
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,490
Oh, get...

598
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,810
Did not expect to see a Venom here.

599
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:12,250
It's fine.

600
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:15,150
Oh, he already uses passive though, so I can do that.

601
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,830
Whoa, they don't know.

602
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,370
Oh, come on, please.

603
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:23,050
No!

604
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,350
Leave me alone!

605
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:25,430
Oh!

606
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,870
It's okay.

607
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:29,630
It's okay.

608
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,450
I'm still alive.

609
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:31,770
He left me alone.

610
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:33,930
He left me alone.

611
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:34,630
It's okay.

612
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,330
I died because I needed...

613
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,170
I got Adamrez.

614
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,170
That's fucking right.

615
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,030
I'm back, bitch.

616
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,690
You might have killed me.

617
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,010
But I'm back.

618
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:47,590
That's fucking right.

619
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:48,590
Goodbye, Raccoon.

620
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:50,490
Oh, god.

621
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:51,950
Oh, god.

622
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:52,290
Please.

623
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,370
Please.

624
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:57,870
Where is everybody?

625
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:00,790
Okay, nice.

626
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,310
What the fuck?

627
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:03,850
Who won that?

628
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:05,330
Look at that.

629
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,130
Look at that.

630
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,150
Everything came...

631
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,250
Everything worked out.

632
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:10,890
Look at that.

633
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:13,010
I'm not even bottom fragger!

634
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:14,470
Look at that!

635
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,110
Not even bottom fragger.

636
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,110
I did my job.

637
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:24,010
I got whatever the fire thing is.

638
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:24,970
I don't even know.

639
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:25,950
What is that?

640
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:27,290
What even is that?

641
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,950
I got quad kill.

642
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:29,790
Look at that.

643
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,610
He got five, but I got four.

644
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,030
Who needs...

645
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:33,570
Oh, my god.

646
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,050
You're right.

647
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,250
Who the fuck needs tank?

648
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:37,030
All we need is four DPS.

649
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,830
We're theorycrafting now.

650
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,230
Okay, I think I'm warmed up.

651
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,910
I think I'm warmed up now.

652
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:43,790
I'm not.

653
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:44,790
But, like, I think...

654
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,930
I think it's doable.

655
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,730
If we lose two games in a row, we swapping accounts.

656
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,190
I can't.

657
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,730
If we lose two games in a row, it's over.

658
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:55,590
We're going to...

659
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,350
We're traveling somewhere else.

660
00:29:59,450 --> 00:29:59,910
All right.

661
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:01,490
0-4-2.

662
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:02,130
Exactly.

663
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,670
0-4-2 is the real meta.

664
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:08,250
Okay, I'm a little nervous because, like, it's been a while.

665
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,170
It's been a while.

666
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:14,170
I have a Celestial 1 alt account.

667
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,090
That we can use.

668
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:21,290
Like, I say we as in you're part of this, but...

669
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,130
It's our account, chat.

670
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,470
It's our account.

671
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:29,130
But I do have a Celestial 1 account.

672
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:30,390
And I hope...

673
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:34,730
And I'm pretty sure by the end of the stream, we're going to have a Celestial 3 account.

674
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,690
Without how I'm feeling tonight.

675
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,490
I am not feeling rivals.

676
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:43,630
I am not feeling, like, ready for rivals mentally.

677
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,330
And my hands do not feel like it.

678
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:47,970
But it's okay.

679
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:49,070
We can do this.

680
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,050
Why is Venom my menu character?

681
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,050
You know why.

682
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:54,110
You know exactly why.

683
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,010
He's, like, the best one out of all.

684
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,050
I think he...

685
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:04,030
Honestly, I'm pretty sure he has the...

686
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,210
He has the best ass out of all the characters.

687
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,510
Like, okay.

688
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:08,750
Here, I'll prove it.

689
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,010
Yeah, sure.

690
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:10,390
Yeah.

691
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,910
Yeah, she has that.

692
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,010
But look at...

693
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,030
But then you compare Venom.

694
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,410
And it's actually thicker.

695
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:23,230
It's actually...

696
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,830
It's actually, like, tall.

697
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:26,430
Like, you know.

698
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,890
It protrudes out more.

699
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:30,450
Oh, yeah!

700
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:30,850
I forgot!

701
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:31,770
Okay, so.

702
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,510
I have, like...

703
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:36,030
I have 43,000 currency.

704
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:39,370
Because I did promise you guys that...

705
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,190
That the moment...

706
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:46,330
I am sponsored or partnered with Marvel Rivals...

707
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:49,150
I shall spend for my first skin.

708
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,350
And...

709
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:50,630
Okay.

710
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,030
Not now.

711
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,470
But not now.

712
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:58,310
Not...

713
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,210
Not now.

714
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:00,430
We're in-game.

715
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:01,750
We will.

716
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:02,870
But not now.

717
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:06,730
Alright.

718
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,290
Who's on my team?

719
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,470
Oh, they fixed it!

720
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,490
They fixed it in the past.

721
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,070
You weren't able to see...

722
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,510
They're gonna run Hella Hawkeye Bucky?

723
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:20,590
Who's they?

724
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,470
Who's they?

725
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,230
Am I playing against some...

726
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,710
Who the fuck is they?

727
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,270
No.

728
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:32,650
Oh, no.

729
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,350
Who the fuck is they?

730
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,290
Who am I against?

731
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,180
The moment they say that...

732
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:44,470
They know we have someone.

733
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,030
Okay.

734
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,650
Am I about to get Glyph Armed?

735
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:50,170
Oh, I wanna ban...

736
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,450
I wanna ban Groot.

737
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:55,390
I don't wanna play against...

738
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,510
Oh, I don't wanna play against Groot.

739
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:03,410
I swear to God, if I get Name Ward or Groot...

740
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:05,430
I swear to fuck God.

741
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:06,690
I sw-

742
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:11,650
Okay.

743
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:15,850
I guess I suffer, I guess.

744
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:20,170
If like...

745
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,290
Do we have a shield tank?

746
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,290
Oh my God, we're all streamer mode.

747
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,730
Oh my God, I recognize this Raccoon.

748
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:28,870
I know who this Raccoon player is.

749
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:29,810
That's an insta boy.

750
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,590
I recognize that voice.

751
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,790
I'm sorry.

752
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:39,430
Okay.

753
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:41,330
Story time.

754
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:44,850
This Raccoon player has the biggest fucking ego.

755
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,890
To be fair, majority of Raccoon players have the biggest fucking ego.

756
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,630
But this guy was like...

757
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,250
I had him like...

758
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:56,490
I had him once in my game and then I insta void him the next game.

759
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:58,550
But he was like...

760
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,650
He was like...

761
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,810
They're scared of me, so they ban my Rocket.

762
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:02,810
And I'm like, bro.

763
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:05,730
It's cause you can only fucking play Rocket.

764
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:07,770
They're not scared of you.

765
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:13,110
They're not scared of you.

766
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:15,690
It's cause you can only play Rocket.

767
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:20,870
But...

768
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,230
I have to avoid this Raccoon.

769
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,490
I recognize that voice.

770
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,690
I recognize him.

771
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:28,470
Alright.

772
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:30,730
Oh my God, I guess I'll give this to group.

773
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:33,230
I took it, I took it, I took it.

774
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:34,110
Nice.

775
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:35,870
Nice, that's huge.

776
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:36,730
Okay.

777
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:37,830
I'm sorry.

778
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:41,530
But like, I cannot deal with Rocket players at all.

779
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:43,130
Hulk one, Hulk one, Hulk one, Hulk one.

780
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:43,970
Hulk Hulk Hulk.

781
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:44,610
Hulk Hulk Hulk.

782
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,110
I am not like...

783
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,390
I am...

784
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:49,990
I have Iron Fist and I'm like fucking wiener.

785
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,310
They don't have fight here, they don't have fight.

786
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:52,990
They have to play with Jax.

787
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,150
No targets, no targets.

788
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,010
I'm dead.

789
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,450
Fucking Iron Fist, man.

790
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,550
Oh man, unfortunate.

791
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,670
Oh, it's just me and you.

792
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,050
They have anti-dive.

793
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:06,750
Oh wait, we don't even...

794
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:07,830
We don't have...

795
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:08,970
Oh my God, he blocked.

796
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:10,050
Is this eating pizza?

797
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,190
Wait, no.

798
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:13,230
The eating pizza thing is not...

799
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,090
That's it, I can't tell.

800
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:14,770
There's too many...

801
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:16,170
All of us are streamer mode now.

802
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:20,610
Guys, first game is not always the best, guys.

803
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:21,230
We all...

804
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,570
We all know it.

805
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:25,510
We all know it.

806
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:26,630
Okay.

807
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,870
Guys, I don't know.

808
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:28,430
I don't...

809
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,170
I'm trying to believe in this team.

810
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,430
But like...

811
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,730
It's a little hard right now.

812
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:42,910
The first person that died was the Rocket, which is like...

813
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:43,610
Which is like...

814
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,510
Which is like...

815
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:49,250
The one person that shouldn't be the one that died first.

816
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,850
I'm surprised I didn't die.

817
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:53,630
Yo.

818
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,810
There are more people hiding around.

819
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,130
Okay.

820
00:35:58,530 --> 00:35:59,070
Alright, what are we doing?

821
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:00,590
Guys.

822
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,590
We should just go like...

823
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,950
I am...

824
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,830
I'm gonna try...

825
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,610
To like...

826
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:08,470
Die, I guess.

827
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,410
Come on, bro.

828
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:11,510
Yo, yo.

829
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:12,350
Go Punisher.

830
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:13,390
Somebody go Punisher.

831
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:18,430
Okay.

832
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:21,830
See, this is how I should have died first, guys.

833
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,410
That's what I'm saying.

834
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:27,210
I should be the one dying first.

835
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,870
With like this comp.

836
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,150
Against this comp.

837
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:32,870
Yeah, I...

838
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:33,590
I'm not...

839
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,810
No, these are nobodies.

840
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:38,030
Like, I don't recognize these names.

841
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:41,350
It's also like incredibly late, too.

842
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:43,990
Nice.

843
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,210
Venom's literally one.

844
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,310
Get this Iron Fist, man.

845
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,130
Iron Fist?

846
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,050
Oh, shit.

847
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:52,830
Where?

848
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,230
Where is everybody?

849
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:57,450
Where is everybody?

850
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:58,850
Oh, that's...

851
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,190
Okay.

852
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:12,970
Also, I remember he complains a lot.

853
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:13,430
That's...

854
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:14,570
I remember now, guys.

855
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:14,890
This guy...

856
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,450
I remember now.

857
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,130
This guy also complains a lot.

858
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,250
That's why I...

859
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:32,010
That's why I also avoided him.

860
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:34,630
Alright.

861
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:37,990
Yeah.

862
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:39,810
I'm with you.

863
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:40,210
I'm with you.

864
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:41,610
It's okay.

865
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:42,710
It's okay.

866
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:42,790
It's okay.

867
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,290
At least we capped first point, guys.

868
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:46,130
At least...

869
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,830
At least we capped first point.

870
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:48,970
I have no idea what's going on.

871
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,610
Everything is fucking too much stuff going on right now.

872
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:53,970
Everything...

873
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,150
There's too much stuff going on.

874
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:56,550
Alright, nice.

875
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:57,110
We did it.

876
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,210
We did it.

877
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,290
I don't need to comm at all.

878
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,790
This team can comm for me.

879
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:02,230
Oh, yeah.

880
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:03,250
No, it is him.

881
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,250
I remember his name.

882
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:06,990
Alright.

883
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:08,690
It helps that he's like...

884
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,810
Has a...

885
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:10,390
Oh, shit.

886
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:10,950
Wait, guys.

887
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,410
I didn't freeze him, but I need to reload.

888
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:14,970
I need to reload.

889
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,470
Oh, it's okay.

890
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,370
Everybody is alive.

891
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:18,270
Oh.

892
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,110
I back away.

893
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,670
I back away.

894
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:31,570
It's fine.

895
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:32,470
They used everything.

896
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,310
Alright, let's go.

897
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,550
Oh, wait.

898
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,390
Why did they ult there?

899
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:42,610
Because they said we push, so I push.

900
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:47,530
I was just listening to comms.

901
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:48,330
What?

902
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,690
I heard we push.

903
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:57,430
I listen.

904
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,670
Okay, let's go.

905
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:04,470
That's good because we didn't stagger.

906
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,730
Other than the fact that our...

907
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:06,650
Our...

908
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:09,170
Venom sort of...

909
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:10,410
Okay.

910
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:11,690
That's fine.

911
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:12,350
That's fine.

912
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,430
Everything is okay.

913
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:16,030
It's not okay, but...

914
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,810
Everything is okay.

915
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:21,950
Everything is okay.

916
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,310
Oh, my god.

917
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:25,970
Okay, it's fine.

918
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,230
It's fine.

919
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:29,050
It's not okay.

920
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:29,670
It's fine.

921
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:31,250
We're so back.

922
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:31,990
We're not back.

923
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,070
We're not back.

924
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,110
I die here, 100%.

925
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,630
I am not living this.

926
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:43,570
I am not living it.

927
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:47,750
Who the fuck said push?

928
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,590
Somebody said push!

929
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,790
It's like, we push this.

930
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:53,590
I was like, okay.

931
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:54,970
I listen.

932
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,530
I only listen.

933
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,850
I just listen.

934
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:05,990
Okay, I'll never listen again, guys.

935
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,990
I'm never listening again.

936
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,830
Oh, I missed the freeze.

937
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:13,910
That's bad.

938
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:15,890
I missed the freeze.

939
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,630
That's so bad.

940
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:22,770
It literally is like, one thing.

941
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,270
If I miss the freeze, we die.

942
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:29,670
Yeah, we can walk it.

943
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,700
Okay, I have...

944
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:36,390
Okay, but what if it's our rocket that gets picked?

945
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:39,630
Do you think he would do it?

946
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:40,670
Guys?

947
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:42,630
Do you think he would swap?

948
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:47,410
Oh, fuck.

949
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:47,900
He fucking...

950
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:52,030
I did not expect him to do that.

951
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:57,570
Oh my god, I just got it.

952
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,090
I got you, I got you.

953
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,870
Oh my god.

954
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:06,450
There you go.

955
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:10,030
Oh my god.

956
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:11,530
Nice.

957
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:14,470
Okay, what's going on?

958
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,410
What's going on?

959
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:17,910
What's going on?

960
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:18,850
What's...

961
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:25,870
All the timers.

962
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:29,250
What do you mean, please?

963
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:31,810
There's only two people alive.

964
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,250
It's Venom and Rocket.

965
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:43,390
These comms are pretty ass.

966
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:44,190
No, they are.

967
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:48,790
These comms are...

968
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:57,750
Oh man, I love first game.

969
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,310
I love...

970
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,310
Guys, I love first game, guys.

971
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:05,210
First game is always the most fun.

972
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:14,910
While he's playing Raccoon, he saw my Revival's Invitational and thought Rocket is meta now.

973
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:17,010
No, he's a Rocket one trick.

974
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:18,230
I've always avoided this guy.

975
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:21,670
I've always avoided him.

976
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,970
Whenever I see him.

977
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:27,250
It's not just because he's a Rocket.

978
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:28,730
Oh wait, he's playing...

979
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:30,170
Oh my god, he's playing...

980
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:32,170
I'd rather put him on Rocket.

981
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,090
He's better as Rocket.

982
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:43,970
I'd rather he plays Rocket.

983
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:48,210
Just because he's like his best character.

984
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:54,410
Alright, I put him on a character he's actually comfortable with.

985
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:56,770
Alright.

986
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:59,050
Yeah, true.

987
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:00,790
You don't need hands for Cloak and Dagger.

988
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:01,850
That is so true.

989
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:04,130
Okay, I'll put it on the Namor.

990
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:06,350
Alright, guys.

991
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:08,790
I'm not confident in this team.

992
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:11,850
But like, I'm just here for a good time.

993
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:17,810
I can tell I might die.

994
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:23,310
There is a chance where I could die.

995
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:24,770
Which is here.

996
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:39,890
Wait, why was he there?

997
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:42,650
Why is he playing Lone Drowned?

998
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:45,030
You say like, you got people on you or something.

999
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:46,770
Why was he...

1000
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:47,130
What?

1001
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:49,890
Why was...

1002
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:52,510
Why was he on Lone Drowned?

1003
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:55,250
Wait, what the fuck?

1004
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:57,110
Yeah.

1005
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:02,750
Oh my god.

1006
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:04,270
Why was he on Lone Drowned?

1007
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:06,550
This is the first time I've seen a support on Lone Drowned.

1008
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:07,950
First, to start off.

1009
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:12,190
Please, you don't have to climb like Rocket.

1010
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:15,170
You need to stop that vehicle.

1011
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:18,350
You have to get the high ground as a support player.

1012
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:20,930
And then, when things get rough.

1013
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:23,290
Then, you get out of high...

1014
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:25,010
Oh my god, I'm fucking...

1015
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:25,730
I am not...

1016
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:28,750
I am fumbling my spreeses.

1017
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:36,310
I'm trying to heal.

1018
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:38,490
Goodbye.

1019
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:45,730
Okay, our Namor is alive.

1020
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:48,110
As he's alive.

1021
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:50,070
He's on off of...

1022
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:50,950
He's off of Cloak.

1023
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:54,630
That's...

1024
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:56,470
That seems right, guys.

1025
00:44:58,970 --> 00:44:59,770
There we go.

1026
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:06,010
That seems...

1027
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:10,010
Alright, let's go.

1028
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:10,950
What?

1029
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:14,370
Oh my god.

1030
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:18,990
Who...

1031
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:20,010
Who called the bans?

1032
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:21,570
Who set these bans?

1033
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:22,090
Okay.

1034
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,970
They gonna run...

1035
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:27,830
Who is 11?

1036
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:28,930
Who...

1037
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:30,530
I'm gonna figure this out.

1038
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:31,310
Who is...

1039
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:31,690
I'm gonna...

1040
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:32,410
Who is...

1041
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:33,250
Okay.

1042
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:34,490
7.

1043
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:35,130
Okay.

1044
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:36,270
Alright.

1045
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:38,350
7 and 11.

1046
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:42,980
Oh.

1047
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:54,740
You shouldn't be allowed to type and talk in chat.

1048
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:07,130
Dead first.

1049
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:07,530
That's like

1050
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:15,130
dead first on Rocket.

1051
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:17,950
That's exactly what I said.

1052
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:19,050
Like...

1053
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:24,330
There's no way you should die first as Rocket.

1054
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:25,370
As...

1055
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:27,190
You're literally a raccoon.

1056
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:30,510
You can climb.

1057
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:32,970
What can I do?

1058
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:37,010
All I can do is skate fast after 4 seconds.

1059
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:38,390
Like...

1060
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:39,350
Crazy.

1061
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:40,430
Like...

1062
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,030
That's what I said.

1063
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:47,390
Okay.

1064
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:47,650
Damn.

1065
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:49,290
If we lose this one, we're fucking...

1066
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:49,410
We're...

1067
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:50,910
We're gonna get...

1068
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:52,050
We're swapping accounts.

1069
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:55,490
What a great start.

1070
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:56,070
Okay.

1071
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:57,950
Now...

1072
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:59,370
Now, I can buy...

1073
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:02,590
This would be the only skin I buy because I'm not a fan of all the...

1074
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:03,010
Cause like...

1075
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:05,670
I'm only buying skins of characters I actually play.

1076
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:08,630
And I'm not a fan of any of these support skins.

1077
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:10,610
This is the only skin I actually like.

1078
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:12,450
But I'm also not equipping it yet.

1079
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:13,050
Cause...

1080
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:14,090
Unless they like fix...

1081
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:15,050
Did they fix the bug?

1082
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:16,850
Where anyone that had used...

1083
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:18,210
Also, it's basically free for me.

1084
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:19,610
I got the currency for free.

1085
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:28,910
But did they fix the bug where if Loki gets MVP, everybody's OBS crashes?

1086
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:29,830
Like...

1087
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:30,810
Did they fix that?

1088
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:31,870
Cause I don't know if they did.

1089
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:32,790
Also, Ren!

1090
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,010
Thank you for the Twitch Prime!

1091
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:34,410
Thank you!

1092
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:35,050
Thank you!

1093
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:35,470
Squeaky!

1094
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:36,590
Thank you for the Twitch Prime!

1095
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:37,110
And Kelly!

1096
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:38,530
Thank you for the Tier 1 sub!

1097
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:39,950
Wait, you guys didn't know?

1098
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:41,710
There was a bug where...

1099
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:46,110
If President Loki gets an MVP, everybody's OBS crashes.

1100
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:48,170
Um...

1101
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:48,810
And I...

1102
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:49,110
Like...

1103
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:50,450
I don't know if they still...

1104
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,310
If they...

1105
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:51,970
Um...

1106
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:53,170
If it's still going on.

1107
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:54,370
But I will buy it.

1108
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:55,450
No, fuck it.

1109
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:56,090
I feel a lot.

1110
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:58,190
Yeah, he crashes the economy!

1111
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:02,550
I don't know!

1112
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:03,870
I saw it on Twitter!

1113
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:05,390
Shroud was talking about it!

1114
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:06,770
I saw it on Twitter and it was like...

1115
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:08,110
It was like talking about it.

1116
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:08,890
Um...

1117
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:09,610
On the clip.

1118
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:10,310
So I was like, you know what?

1119
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:10,970
I'll put it on.

1120
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:12,090
Fuck it.

1121
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:13,850
If it happens, it happens.

1122
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:15,510
Wait, did I actually put my...

1123
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:16,090
No, I didn't put it on.

1124
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:17,150
Yeah.

1125
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:19,810
Wait, I won't get...

1126
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:20,650
Hey, you don't know that.

1127
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:21,510
You don't know that.

1128
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:22,630
My Loki's pretty alright.

1129
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:23,950
I figured it out.

1130
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:25,350
I figured out how to play...

1131
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:26,590
Okay, I have not figured it out.

1132
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,630
I've not actually figured out how to play Loki.

1133
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:29,990
But like...

1134
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:30,990
It can't be that bad.

1135
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:32,230
I can do it.

1136
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:33,050
I can pull it off.

1137
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:33,750
I...

1138
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:40,530
I can pull it off, guys.

1139
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:41,110
I believe.

1140
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:43,590
That's crazy, though.

1141
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:46,070
I mean, that's how I feel on the inside, but it would never happen.

1142
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:49,650
You're literally the trash panda!

1143
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,760
Oh my god.

1144
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:04,380
Oh my god.

1145
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,100
Please don't talk to me.

1146
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:11,380
Please don't talk to me.

1147
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,180
It shouldn't be allowed to type or talk in chat.

1148
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,620
Jesus Christ.

1149
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:24,740
It's like you have lost your privilege to talk when you pick Rocket.

1150
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,040
Yeah, no, I 100% avoided him.

1151
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,120
No, I've always avoided him.

1152
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,100
Every time I get...

1153
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,680
I see that person, I...

1154
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,600
If he's on the enemy team, I avoid him.

1155
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:38,040
I avoid majority of my Rocket players because I don't...

1156
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:42,900
Like, I don't even do that to Jeff players because there's some really good Jeff players that I'm actually like...

1157
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:47,080
I'm actually like afraid of because they can do like Jeff really, really well.

1158
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:50,340
But like, I always avoid Rocket.

1159
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:52,840
I always avoid 99% of Rocket players.

1160
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:01,260
There's always like one tricks that I respect for like off meta characters.

1161
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,160
I would never respect a Rocket one trick.

1162
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:16,410
I know like there's a lot of one trick players that would force like, you know, they'll force Scarlet, Widow, Mr. Fantastic.

1163
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:22,910
Or Penny or like, like all the like off meta picks, Squirrel Girl.

1164
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:28,350
There's a really good Squirrel Girl top 500 player in rank that I respect a lot.

1165
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:31,050
Because like, he's actually fucking insane.

1166
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:31,710
Like, I...

1167
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:32,450
You do not live.

1168
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,450
Penny's incredibly bad in low elo.

1169
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:42,090
But there is like one, one player on Penny that's really good and really fucking annoying.

1170
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:45,350
But they're only good if they have another tank player.

1171
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:47,670
Only good if they're not playing solo tank.

1172
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:49,950
But I would never respect a...

1173
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:56,810
I have no one on the top of my head with the amount of rank I played where I respect a...

1174
00:50:57,350 --> 00:50:59,950
Where I will respect a Rocket one trick.

1175
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:05,690
I literally know zero Rocket one tricks that are good enough to be respected.

1176
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:13,810
Jose, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

1177
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:14,950
Thank you, thank you.

1178
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:20,890
I hope you met a...

1179
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:22,170
I'm not, that's the thing.

1180
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:24,530
I've never met a Rocket player that I respected.

1181
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:28,030
At best, people would like...

1182
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:30,650
People would just ban Rocket because that's the only character they play.

1183
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:35,410
It's funny you guys, you think I respect Kony.

1184
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:39,430
I'm joking.

1185
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:42,130
I'm joking, I'm joking.

1186
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:44,270
Okay, if they're playing...

1187
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:45,370
Okay, I'll play Adam then.

1188
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:46,950
I do Adam.

1189
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:50,190
I can play Adam, I think.

1190
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:52,870
It's been a while.

1191
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:55,890
But like, I think I can pull it off.

1192
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:58,230
Alright, who are they banning?

1193
00:51:58,430 --> 00:52:00,870
I tapped out, so I don't care as much.

1194
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:03,090
Alright.

1195
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:05,650
Groot, 100%.

1196
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:06,390
I agree.

1197
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:07,290
For real.

1198
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:10,090
I'm glad we all came into it and understand.

1199
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:12,810
I can't believe they fixed the thing where we can't see who we're with now.

1200
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,350
Oh shit, no Luna.

1201
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:15,270
That's alright.

1202
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:17,150
It's too late, I've got Adam.

1203
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:18,410
You can't steal it from me.

1204
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:23,310
Well, we don't need to ban.

1205
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:24,510
Let's ban Hela.

1206
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:25,290
I don't mind.

1207
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:26,950
I don't mind.

1208
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:31,210
There's no other character I wanna ban anyway.

1209
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:35,790
What are they gonna ban?

1210
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:36,870
Wolverine?

1211
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:38,210
Why Wolverine?

1212
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:40,550
There's no Groot to play anyway.

1213
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:44,190
Alright, triple support.

1214
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:45,190
Let's do it.

1215
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:47,670
Let's do it.

1216
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:53,530
Our only damage is Iron Fist, but like, it can't be that bad, right?

1217
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:58,310
Guys, do you think I would ever be able to like...

1218
00:52:58,310 --> 00:52:59,750
Let's see if we can adopt a player.

1219
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:01,990
So we don't have to solo queue.

1220
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:07,550
Just kidnap somebody.

1221
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:08,930
So as long as...

1222
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:10,930
If I have to lose Elo, I want...

1223
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:12,590
I hope like...

1224
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,570
So we can all lose Elo together.

1225
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:20,270
Alright, I'm gonna kidnap somebody.

1226
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:24,150
I do not...

1227
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:27,610
This is very low damage for a team.

1228
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:30,670
Our only damage is literally Iron Fist.

1229
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,110
And like, I'm concerned.

1230
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:34,790
I'm not going down.

1231
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:35,410
Exactly.

1232
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:37,950
I ain't going down alone.

1233
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:39,890
If we lose this, we're swapping accounts.

1234
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:42,310
But I ain't going down alone.

1235
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:45,330
No, we don't need to take high ground as that.

1236
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:46,590
Okay, not yet.

1237
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:48,250
We'll take high ground later.

1238
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:53,850
Guys, it's funny that you think I can DPS in my current state right now.

1239
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:55,070
I'm not okay at the moment.

1240
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:56,270
I'm like...

1241
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:57,250
I'm way...

1242
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:59,190
I'm way too like...

1243
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:00,510
Lethargic right now.

1244
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:02,690
Alright, Sing and Bucky.

1245
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:03,110
Okay.

1246
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:04,810
I am not...

1247
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:05,450
Okay.

1248
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:07,310
They have an actual DPS character.

1249
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:11,710
They have...

1250
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:14,290
They have real DPS characters.

1251
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:16,150
We have...

1252
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:16,770
We have an Iron Fist.

1253
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:18,310
Like, it's good.

1254
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:20,570
It's just not good as a solo.

1255
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:21,870
You know what I mean?

1256
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:27,650
Like, not as a solo adventure type deal.

1257
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:32,930
That's like what I'm like a little worried about.

1258
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:34,430
Oh, and they have Storm.

1259
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:34,850
Wait.

1260
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:36,150
They actually have...

1261
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:37,450
DPS.

1262
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:41,610
Oh my gosh.

1263
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:44,430
There you go.

1264
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:47,590
That's fine.

1265
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:50,770
Oh, our solo DPS is gone.

1266
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:51,770
But that's okay.

1267
00:54:56,830 --> 00:54:57,430
That's...

1268
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:58,110
Oh, shit!

1269
00:54:59,110 --> 00:54:59,570
Nice!

1270
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:04,430
Okay, um...

1271
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:05,470
We...

1272
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:06,230
Okay.

1273
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:08,610
Oh, he's kicking me out.

1274
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:10,430
Oh, fuck!

1275
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:11,870
Oh, I'm still here!

1276
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:14,270
Oh, fuck!

1277
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:14,530
Okay.

1278
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:18,670
Okay, I fly.

1279
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:21,010
I fly.

1280
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:23,650
Okay.

1281
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:29,970
Okay, I'm...

1282
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:31,090
I'm almost...

1283
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:31,810
Almost have a...

1284
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:35,630
Alright, nice.

1285
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:36,310
Oh, fuck!

1286
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:38,070
What the fuck?!

1287
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:38,710
No!

1288
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:39,910
What?!

1289
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:40,610
Where did he...

1290
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:42,630
Where did the Storm come from?!

1291
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:44,850
He just let him walk over?!

1292
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:48,070
He just...

1293
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:48,470
Wait.

1294
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,770
They just walked over!

1295
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:54,050
Okay, it's not even pizza.

1296
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:55,970
I have less fate in Iron Fist.

1297
00:55:56,630 --> 00:55:58,570
I'm just locked up!

1298
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:02,510
Guys, I only trust one Iron Fist player and it's eating pizza.

1299
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:04,510
So now I have less fate now.

1300
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:06,310
Where is he?

1301
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:08,210
Jesus.

1302
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:10,610
I'm like...

1303
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:13,150
Oh my gosh, my aim right now is as Iron...

1304
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:14,470
As Adam is not like...

1305
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:16,590
The most ideal IMO.

1306
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:20,230
Oh, he's low.

1307
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:23,090
Oh, he definitely has thing ult.

1308
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:24,510
I am fucking scared.

1309
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:27,930
I can tell.

1310
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:29,550
I can...

1311
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:30,590
I can 100...

1312
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:30,850
What?

1313
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:31,410
Already?

1314
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:34,090
Jesus Christ.

1315
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:35,250
There we go.

1316
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:37,050
Okay.

1317
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:38,750
That's a good Sol...

1318
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:39,750
You have to admit...

1319
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:41,010
He's still dead.

1320
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:41,510
Okay.

1321
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:46,250
I'm such a good Sol bot!

1322
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:49,550
What the fuck?

1323
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:53,510
That was such a good Sol bot too.

1324
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:56,250
That's unlucky.

1325
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:59,030
Hey look, we don't have Iron Fist anymore.

1326
00:56:59,130 --> 00:56:59,790
Thank God.

1327
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:01,010
Alright.

1328
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:02,670
I'm slowly walking over.

1329
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:05,070
I am a slow guy.

1330
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:06,690
The perfect being that travels...

1331
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:10,530
0.1 mile per hour.

1332
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:13,070
Perfection takes time, guys.

1333
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:16,970
Perfection takes so much time.

1334
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:20,370
Alright.

1335
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:22,230
That's fine.

1336
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:24,750
I...

1337
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:27,070
Okay.

1338
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:30,970
Guys, you have to know.

1339
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:32,630
Perfection takes a lot.

1340
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:35,130
There we go.

1341
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:38,290
Okay.

1342
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:40,510
I know he...

1343
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:42,610
He still has his ult, but he's not using it.

1344
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:44,290
It's a little concerning.

1345
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:46,970
That he's not using it.

1346
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:48,350
I'm scared.

1347
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:55,970
Okay, I need to...

1348
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:58,730
Okay, that's fine.

1349
00:57:58,870 --> 00:58:00,410
We ulted the other support ult.

1350
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:03,310
I don't want to get too close because I have ult right now.

1351
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:05,970
So I'm trying not to...

1352
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:08,130
No, that's bad.

1353
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:09,750
He's looking...

1354
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:12,970
Okay, I don't know if...

1355
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:15,750
Oh my God, I can't do anything.

1356
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:18,110
Oh, fuck.

1357
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:18,450
Okay.

1358
00:58:19,110 --> 00:58:19,870
That's fine.

1359
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:21,410
One more, one more.

1360
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:25,030
I ult here.

1361
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:26,750
Are you serious?!

1362
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:29,190
Please!

1363
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:33,450
Oh my God, I literally cannot!

1364
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:35,350
I cannot!

1365
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:38,990
I'm getting followed everywhere I go!

1366
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:41,970
Please!

1367
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:43,090
Let me live!

1368
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:46,030
He follows me!

1369
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:49,090
Like, what do I do when I get followed?!

1370
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:53,370
Oh no.

1371
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:55,750
Okay.

1372
00:58:58,390 --> 00:58:58,890
Okay.

1373
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:03,450
There we go.

1374
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:04,790
There we go.

1375
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:06,270
No!

1376
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:11,010
Why does no one go up?!

1377
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:14,910
Guys, I don't think Adam's the pick right now.

1378
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:17,930
I'm getting fucking hunted.

1379
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:19,610
Like, crazy.

1380
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:21,990
By everything in existence.

1381
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:26,090
Everything wants to kill me.

1382
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:27,270
Like, what do you do?

1383
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:33,090
Oh shit, I don't have...

1384
00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:34,490
Oh my God!

1385
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:37,950
Mantis?

1386
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:38,750
We could.

1387
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:40,250
We could go Mantis.

1388
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:42,210
It feels like...

1389
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:43,250
I feel like I might have...

1390
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:43,850
I don't know.

1391
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:47,050
I'm just getting hunted for res.

1392
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:47,990
No matter what.

1393
00:59:48,370 --> 00:59:48,670
Okay.

1394
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:51,270
Alright.

1395
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:54,590
Maybe it's not me.

1396
01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:03,570
What do you mean he got banned?!

1397
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:04,970
Wait, are they running free tank?

1398
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,550
They are!

1399
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:07,390
Wait.

1400
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:10,490
There we go.

1401
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:12,010
You're welcome.

1402
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:14,250
I didn't realize.

1403
01:00:16,330 --> 01:00:18,050
Oh my God, they are!

1404
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:20,990
No wonder they banned Wolves!

1405
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:21,910
They're so smart!

1406
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:23,470
Maybe I should run Mantis, actually.

1407
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:24,250
They're gonna...

1408
01:00:25,870 --> 01:00:27,250
They're gonna run three tanks.

1409
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:29,490
He just caught me here.

1410
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:31,130
Exactly.

1411
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:33,670
It's never my fault, guys.

1412
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:34,810
We all know that.

1413
01:00:35,350 --> 01:00:36,450
Oh, he definitely has ult.

1414
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:37,030
I can tell.

1415
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:39,170
He's ready for the Kadabra attack.

1416
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:40,450
Yep.

1417
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:42,170
I'm with us.

1418
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:53,330
There we go.

1419
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:55,290
Oh my God.

1420
01:00:58,190 --> 01:00:58,650
Please.

1421
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:03,890
Oh my God.

1422
01:01:06,190 --> 01:01:06,650
Okay.

1423
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:09,730
I swear to God, if...

1424
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:16,420
I swear to God, leave me...

1425
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:16,820
Fucker!

1426
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:19,740
Okay.

1427
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:22,700
I'm okay.

1428
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:24,660
I'm...

1429
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:26,000
I'm okay.

1430
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:26,880
I...

1431
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,740
I can't do anything.

1432
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:29,680
I...

1433
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:36,040
Every time I think about the potential to res, like...

1434
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:38,220
They're like, fuck you, I guess.

1435
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,420
I can't even think about it.

1436
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:43,660
That's like the worst part.

1437
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:45,960
Like...

1438
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:48,480
It won't even let me think about the possibility.

1439
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:52,620
Okay.

1440
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:55,480
Okay.

1441
01:01:57,860 --> 01:02:00,420
This is the first res I got to actually...

1442
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,540
This is actually the first res I actually got put up.

1443
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:08,660
Oh my God.

1444
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:12,060
This is the first time I actually got to think of a res.

1445
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:13,980
Okay.

1446
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:15,640
Maybe...

1447
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:16,280
I'm going...

1448
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:16,720
Actually, no.

1449
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,680
Atom is good because I have...

1450
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,160
My E is good for this.

1451
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,840
It's the one time where I have to use my E.

1452
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:26,020
If I can make it.

1453
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:27,320
Alright.

1454
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:34,840
I'm just getting stuck!

1455
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,420
Where do I go?!

1456
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:41,520
Oh my God.

1457
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:45,600
I can't believe they ran triple tank.

1458
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:47,220
Alright.

1459
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:49,360
Are they gonna go triple tank?

1460
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:50,520
I'm going Mantis.

1461
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:53,700
I ain't no DPS player.

1462
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:55,080
Sorry, buddy.

1463
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:56,640
Sorry.

1464
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,220
I cannot play DPS in Eternity.

1465
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:02,220
I'm sorry, buddy.

1466
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:04,080
I put all my skill...

1467
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:04,620
My pills...

1468
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:06,900
Put all my points into...

1469
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:08,660
Into support.

1470
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,900
Sorry, Buckle.

1471
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,120
You gotta live with this.

1472
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,300
I'll play Mantis.

1473
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:16,900
They're just heavily stalking me.

1474
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:17,880
Anyways, Atom.

1475
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:19,480
I literally can't do anything on Atom.

1476
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:23,840
Like, every time I try to run anywhere...

1477
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:24,520
They're just there.

1478
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:29,800
Someone's gotta go Moon Knight.

1479
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:32,140
I guess Moon Knight could work.

1480
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,160
I just don't think we...

1481
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:35,160
We just don't have the DPS players for it.

1482
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,540
Yeah, no wonder they ban Wolverine.

1483
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,120
You know what?

1484
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:42,080
We'll counter it.

1485
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:42,920
Squirrel Girl...

1486
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:43,920
Squirrel Girl, Moon Knight.

1487
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:44,660
We'll counter it.

1488
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,800
Squirrel Girl, Moon Knight, Rocket Punisher maybe.

1489
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:48,900
I'll just go Mantis.

1490
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,700
I just don't think Atom is the play against Triple Tank.

1491
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:57,480
It was...

1492
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:58,180
We do not...

1493
01:03:58,180 --> 01:03:59,960
We should not go Iron Fist against...

1494
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:00,940
What the fuck?

1495
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:04,100
You see Triple Tank and you go Iron Fist?

1496
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:05,880
Like, what's wrong with you?

1497
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:08,040
Like...

1498
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,020
What are you guys doing?

1499
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:11,580
Tickle the other tanks?

1500
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,340
Like, just punch them.

1501
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:15,000
There we go.

1502
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:20,180
Also, like, I wanted to go Mantis for the fact that I can sleep the...

1503
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:23,320
I can sleep the...

1504
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:25,920
See, this is exactly why you gotta swap up.

1505
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:29,220
Oh no.

1506
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:31,620
See, this is why.

1507
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,740
I was like, what the fuck are you gonna do?

1508
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:39,900
There we go.

1509
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:42,840
There we go.

1510
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:45,660
That's the only reason why I wanted to go Mantis too.

1511
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,900
I can't sleep though, right now.

1512
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,540
Oh, guess I...

1513
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:55,020
Oh, guess I die.

1514
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:59,980
Why are you still Iron Fist?

1515
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,080
Who are you gonna kill?

1516
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:04,580
Oh my god.

1517
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:06,980
Who would you kill?

1518
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,840
You're just a little guy!

1519
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:11,920
You just have kicks!

1520
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:13,280
Let's give you this.

1521
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:16,580
Oh, and then we... Oh my...

1522
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:17,040
Okay.

1523
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:20,720
At least we have... At least we have Hawkeye now.

1524
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:22,040
Thank god.

1525
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:25,700
I don't...

1526
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:26,320
There we go.

1527
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:30,320
There we go.

1528
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:31,060
I slept him.

1529
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,060
Let's go.

1530
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:34,280
Let's go.

1531
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:38,780
There we go.

1532
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:41,420
He has ult, so...

1533
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:42,400
I can tell.

1534
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:43,540
There we go!

1535
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:45,720
Mantis...

1536
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:47,480
Ah, Mantis 2 will work, I guess.

1537
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:48,600
It'll work.

1538
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:50,580
We did it, guys.

1539
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:51,500
We figured it...

1540
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:52,580
Oh, what?

1541
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,320
I hope they're beating him up.

1542
01:05:58,840 --> 01:05:59,980
I... Okay, they are.

1543
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:00,840
Okay, that's good.

1544
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:02,140
They are beating him up.

1545
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:04,440
Yeah, it's definitely more value.

1546
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:09,740
Usually, Adam is the meta for triple support.

1547
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:13,660
But, like, literally, they're running triple tank, so...

1548
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:17,140
There's, like, nothing I could do as Adam with this comp.

1549
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:20,280
It's fine.

1550
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:25,640
I just don't think we should be running Iron Fist into this.

1551
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:27,720
What?

1552
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:28,960
How did that hit?

1553
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:30,320
What?

1554
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:31,720
How did that not hit?

1555
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:33,580
Bucky, Bucky, Bucky, Bucky.

1556
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:34,560
That should have hit.

1557
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:36,860
That should have 100% hit.

1558
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:38,720
Okay, I need to give you...

1559
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:39,860
Goodbye.

1560
01:06:45,330 --> 01:06:46,550
That seems right.

1561
01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:53,410
Yeah.

1562
01:06:55,530 --> 01:06:56,930
Bucky, Bucky, Bucky, Bucky, Bucky.

1563
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:00,010
Bucky 1, Bucky 1, Bucky 1.

1564
01:07:01,090 --> 01:07:02,110
Oh my god.

1565
01:07:03,950 --> 01:07:04,310
Please.

1566
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:05,070
Oh.

1567
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:06,810
Live, Hulk!

1568
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:08,150
He's not living, guys.

1569
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:11,950
Guys, I don't think he's gonna live.

1570
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:17,470
Yeah, I just don't think Fist is the way to go.

1571
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:18,950
But, like...

1572
01:07:19,550 --> 01:07:24,390
Like I said, the only Iron Fist player I respect is...

1573
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:25,930
Eating pizza.

1574
01:07:26,430 --> 01:07:28,190
I don't respect any other Iron Fist players.

1575
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:32,590
Even if they're in Eternity, I just don't respect.

1576
01:07:34,490 --> 01:07:35,530
I mean...

1577
01:07:35,530 --> 01:07:36,910
I'm just gonna wait.

1578
01:07:37,410 --> 01:07:39,410
I don't wanna use it if they have Disappear.

1579
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:42,190
Kiting, kiting, kiting.

1580
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:42,530
Oh.

1581
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:44,710
Oh.

1582
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:48,470
We gotta use this because you guys don't have use.

1583
01:07:49,130 --> 01:07:51,250
Come on, I don't wanna be the only one.

1584
01:07:51,350 --> 01:07:52,010
Oh, okay.

1585
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:53,390
That's fine, I guess.

1586
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:54,710
That's fine.

1587
01:07:54,910 --> 01:07:56,990
I don't know where everybody is, but that's okay.

1588
01:07:58,910 --> 01:07:59,430
Oh.

1589
01:08:00,370 --> 01:08:01,210
That's okay.

1590
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:04,070
They used both ults.

1591
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:07,470
There we go, guys.

1592
01:08:07,630 --> 01:08:08,190
Shoot him.

1593
01:08:09,230 --> 01:08:10,170
Wherever he is.

1594
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:15,350
How did they...

1595
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:16,650
Oh my god, there you are.

1596
01:08:18,130 --> 01:08:18,590
Go!

1597
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:19,930
Go, Hawkeye, go!

1598
01:08:22,290 --> 01:08:23,590
You're more than I...

1599
01:08:23,590 --> 01:08:25,070
Clearly, you're Iron Fist.

1600
01:08:27,410 --> 01:08:28,010
Okay.

1601
01:08:29,090 --> 01:08:30,150
I need to farm you.

1602
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:31,210
There you go.

1603
01:08:32,890 --> 01:08:33,330
Go.

1604
01:08:33,330 --> 01:08:35,250
Go, Hawkeye, go!

1605
01:08:37,390 --> 01:08:38,950
Let me farm that headshot.

1606
01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:40,230
Okay.

1607
01:08:40,970 --> 01:08:41,930
Go, Hawkeye, go!

1608
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:42,730
Farm your shit!

1609
01:08:43,690 --> 01:08:44,790
Go, do your thing!

1610
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:46,210
Okay.

1611
01:08:47,570 --> 01:08:48,090
Nice.

1612
01:08:48,570 --> 01:08:49,630
We're doing our thing.

1613
01:08:50,370 --> 01:08:53,190
I'm a little worried because I don't think that portal lasts the entire time.

1614
01:08:53,570 --> 01:08:55,010
So I think they're waiting right now.

1615
01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:55,650
Yep.

1616
01:08:55,930 --> 01:08:56,910
I knew it!

1617
01:08:57,170 --> 01:08:58,630
I fucking knew it!

1618
01:08:58,910 --> 01:09:00,150
I could tell!

1619
01:09:00,690 --> 01:09:04,250
Oh, he fucked it up!

1620
01:09:05,590 --> 01:09:06,270
Let's go.

1621
01:09:07,030 --> 01:09:08,270
I knew it, guys.

1622
01:09:08,790 --> 01:09:15,050
Like, it was so obvious that it definitely did not cover the entire time.

1623
01:09:15,450 --> 01:09:16,870
That was an awful...

1624
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:18,150
What the fuck?!

1625
01:09:19,090 --> 01:09:20,150
Oh, there's a mag on point?

1626
01:09:22,570 --> 01:09:23,010
Guys?

1627
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:28,350
Get out of here.

1628
01:09:28,530 --> 01:09:29,290
What the fuck?

1629
01:09:30,150 --> 01:09:31,150
What the fuck?

1630
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:33,850
Okay.

1631
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:35,110
I'm surprised.

1632
01:09:35,530 --> 01:09:36,970
He's just chilling.

1633
01:09:40,030 --> 01:09:41,530
He's just chilling there.

1634
01:09:43,230 --> 01:09:44,510
Like, what are you doing?

1635
01:09:46,150 --> 01:09:48,030
Bro, he was just juking everything.

1636
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:49,150
I was trying to punch him.

1637
01:09:52,110 --> 01:09:53,690
Bro, he was just chilling.

1638
01:09:55,530 --> 01:09:56,210
Alright.

1639
01:09:56,210 --> 01:09:56,610
Alright.

1640
01:09:58,850 --> 01:09:59,530
Alright.

1641
01:10:03,930 --> 01:10:04,610
Oh.

1642
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:10,790
Well, first...

1643
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:12,130
Don't worry, I got you!

1644
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:14,630
Don't worry, Sue!

1645
01:10:16,930 --> 01:10:18,030
Okay, he lives.

1646
01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:18,530
That's fine.

1647
01:10:21,990 --> 01:10:23,030
That's okay!

1648
01:10:23,730 --> 01:10:25,050
That's okay, Sue!

1649
01:10:25,050 --> 01:10:27,010
I still fucking got you!

1650
01:10:27,610 --> 01:10:29,050
But who got me?!

1651
01:10:30,150 --> 01:10:30,950
That's okay.

1652
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:35,150
Oh, no.

1653
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:36,690
Oh, shit.

1654
01:10:36,790 --> 01:10:37,730
Oh, that is insane.

1655
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:38,570
That is such a good ult.

1656
01:10:38,690 --> 01:10:39,090
Not gonna lie.

1657
01:10:40,230 --> 01:10:40,850
Wait, where?

1658
01:10:41,850 --> 01:10:42,610
Oh, there he is.

1659
01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:44,510
I'll just stay here.

1660
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:46,190
I'll just push cart.

1661
01:10:47,290 --> 01:10:48,690
I think our team will be fine.

1662
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:50,550
And I'll damage here.

1663
01:10:50,890 --> 01:10:52,570
And then I'll give you heals.

1664
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:55,230
And then I'll also give you heals.

1665
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:57,330
And then he's gonna slam in.

1666
01:10:57,730 --> 01:10:58,850
And then he's sleepy.

1667
01:10:59,530 --> 01:11:00,550
Sleep and we die.

1668
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:01,230
We die.

1669
01:11:01,610 --> 01:11:01,950
We die.

1670
01:11:02,010 --> 01:11:03,010
Unless I stand behind here.

1671
01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:03,590
We live.

1672
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:04,670
We live.

1673
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:06,050
We had a strange in front of me.

1674
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:07,690
I hope that...

1675
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:09,130
Oh, my god.

1676
01:11:09,310 --> 01:11:09,990
Don't do it, son!

1677
01:11:11,190 --> 01:11:11,710
That's fine.

1678
01:11:13,850 --> 01:11:15,810
Oh, I'm trying to...

1679
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:16,630
be okay.

1680
01:11:17,970 --> 01:11:18,490
Oh!

1681
01:11:19,610 --> 01:11:22,290
I can't tell what's going on!

1682
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:25,770
What the fuck?

1683
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:30,310
Jeff out of nowhere.

1684
01:11:32,650 --> 01:11:33,890
Talking...

1685
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:36,290
Wait, is that...

1686
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:37,410
Chopper?

1687
01:11:44,570 --> 01:11:46,830
Fucking stupid Chopper!

1688
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:48,970
Oh, my god!

1689
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:50,470
Bro, fuck you!

1690
01:11:51,470 --> 01:11:54,530
I swear to god, if that is Chopper...

1691
01:11:58,470 --> 01:12:01,690
Oh, my god!

1692
01:12:02,570 --> 01:12:05,970
I swear to god, if this is Chopper...

1693
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:15,170
I'm gonna be so upset.

1694
01:12:17,990 --> 01:12:18,450
Okay.

1695
01:12:20,010 --> 01:12:20,470
Okay.

1696
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:23,810
It's fine.

1697
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:31,690
Fuck this fight.

1698
01:12:32,150 --> 01:12:32,410
Fight!

1699
01:12:39,030 --> 01:12:40,770
Fucking hell!

1700
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:43,390
Chopper's on his fucking...

1701
01:12:43,390 --> 01:12:43,890
Oh!

1702
01:12:46,210 --> 01:12:47,370
Fucking...

1703
01:12:49,030 --> 01:12:49,610
Bro!

1704
01:12:54,090 --> 01:12:56,450
Stunned five times.

1705
01:12:59,090 --> 01:13:00,150
That's right.

1706
01:13:00,570 --> 01:13:02,330
You deserve it.

1707
01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:07,790
I can't believe it!

1708
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:13,410
I can't believe that's Chopper.

1709
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:14,650
Was he the Venom player?

1710
01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:17,010
You come back!

1711
01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:22,350
I swear to god!

1712
01:13:24,330 --> 01:13:26,130
I'm so low.

1713
01:13:30,370 --> 01:13:32,030
Watch this Loki.

1714
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:34,710
He sets up triple clones of everyone and then he just dies fast.

1715
01:13:35,610 --> 01:13:36,890
Oh, my god!

1716
01:13:38,070 --> 01:13:39,190
He's like...

1717
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:41,970
Fuck!

1718
01:13:44,430 --> 01:13:45,590
I'll kidnap Chopper.

1719
01:13:45,970 --> 01:13:48,110
I'll kidnap Chopper!

1720
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:53,270
Was he the Venom chat?

1721
01:13:53,450 --> 01:13:54,150
Was that him?

1722
01:13:56,570 --> 01:13:58,030
Was he on Venom?

1723
01:13:58,690 --> 01:14:02,450
Was that because I was sleeping Venom non-stop?

1724
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:03,790
Oh, my god.

1725
01:14:03,890 --> 01:14:04,970
Oh, my god!

1726
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:07,430
It was!

1727
01:14:07,630 --> 01:14:08,930
They fell for it!

1728
01:14:10,330 --> 01:14:11,950
They actually fell for it!

1729
01:14:11,970 --> 01:14:12,170
Oh, my god!

1730
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:13,170
It is him!

1731
01:14:13,610 --> 01:14:14,730
No, they don't swap.

1732
01:14:15,070 --> 01:14:15,250
It's crazy.

1733
01:14:18,110 --> 01:14:19,110
No way!

1734
01:14:19,550 --> 01:14:20,470
In eternity?

1735
01:14:20,810 --> 01:14:22,290
No fucking way!

1736
01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:26,150
There he is.

1737
01:14:26,210 --> 01:14:27,650
Yeah, that was him.

1738
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:30,110
That's why he's so...

1739
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:35,780
That's funny.

1740
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:38,580
That's actually funny.

1741
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:45,780
I

1742
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:50,820
slept him again!

1743
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:53,840
He deserves it.

1744
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:57,880
He fucking deserves it.

1745
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:02,340
Oh,

1746
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:06,860
I missed it.

1747
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:07,640
I missed it.

1748
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:11,300
Oh, my god.

1749
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:13,500
Okay.

1750
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:16,620
I don't think he got anybody, but that's...

1751
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:16,820
What?

1752
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:17,460
Oh, fuck.

1753
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:18,020
Where am I?

1754
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:20,820
Where am I?

1755
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:23,600
Where am I?

1756
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:24,420
Okay, there you go.

1757
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:25,960
Oh, my god.

1758
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:31,320
I can't believe it.

1759
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:32,420
I can't believe it.

1760
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:35,980
Goodbye, Chopper.

1761
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:37,100
Goodbye.

1762
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:45,520
It's crazy.

1763
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:48,000
Don't worry, I'll try and kidnap Chopper.

1764
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,000
I'll try and kidnap him.

1765
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:51,820
Let's go, Donkey Kong.

1766
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:54,900
There's only one player that calls me Donkey Kong.

1767
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:01,120
Either we get a tie or we win.

1768
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:02,260
We'll see how it goes.

1769
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:06,960
Lucy, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

1770
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:07,980
Thank you, thank you.

1771
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,180
Thank you guys for all the happy partner anniversary.

1772
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:12,260
Yeah, swapping your mantis was definitely the play.

1773
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:14,240
Definitely the play.

1774
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:16,060
We needed to sleep.

1775
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:20,420
We definitely needed to sleep there.

1776
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,460
The Venom couldn't do jack shit after that.

1777
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:25,120
I'm happy.

1778
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:29,320
I'm happy if we get a draw, because that was such a fucking rough game.

1779
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:31,840
That game was so rough.

1780
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,520
I can't believe this is real.

1781
01:16:39,020 --> 01:16:41,420
It started off so fucking rough.

1782
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:44,340
Jeff is left side.

1783
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:47,320
Jeff is left side, and then Loki is playing really far out.

1784
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:49,860
We got this.

1785
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:51,600
I'm okay.

1786
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:54,060
Walk forward a little more.

1787
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:59,020
They're coming, they're coming.

1788
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:03,400
Oh, they did the thingy.

1789
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:08,460
Oh, they pushed really far.

1790
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:10,300
Oh, I missed a sleep?

1791
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:10,740
Really?

1792
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:12,820
Oh, he's smart.

1793
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:14,260
He waited until I used it.

1794
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:19,380
He waited until I used my sleep to go in.

1795
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:21,660
Oh, I can't believe I missed it though.

1796
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:24,520
He bad.

1797
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:26,320
He bad.

1798
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:30,380
That's five.

1799
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:34,800
There we go.

1800
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:35,980
Nice.

1801
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:38,220
Yay!

1802
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:40,500
We did it!

1803
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:41,000
He died.

1804
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:43,180
He died!

1805
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:47,560
We did it!

1806
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:49,520
I'll friend him and see if I can kidnap him.

1807
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,700
Guys, it's only 1am.

1808
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:58,960
How are we at the point where all the Korean players are on now?

1809
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:00,360
Oh, no.

1810
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:01,860
Oh, no.

1811
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:02,600
Oh, yay!

1812
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,000
I did it.

1813
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,580
We didn't lose two in a row.

1814
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:07,620
Let's fucking go.

1815
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:09,560
Okay, where's...

1816
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:10,640
Pottymonkey.

1817
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:12,740
Why the fuck is his name Pottymonkey?

1818
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:20,560
He might try to run, but let's kidnap him.

1819
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:24,500
Okay, let's see if he adds me.

1820
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:28,440
What?

1821
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:30,960
I heard you were adopting.

1822
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:33,980
I'm trying to kidnap...

1823
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:38,320
I'm trying to kidnap Choppa.

1824
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:52,800
Chop, if we could three stack with Choppa, we will be unstoppable.

1825
01:18:57,980 --> 01:18:58,780
No!

1826
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,820
Oh, my God.

1827
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:12,020
Oh, hey, sir.

1828
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:13,000
Thank you.

1829
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,100
Thanks, AZ.

1830
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,620
Okay, invite me.

1831
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:22,360
Okay, reach everyone and coach.

1832
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:23,840
All right.

1833
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:25,260
All right.

1834
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:26,340
Oh, my God.

1835
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:27,900
I can't believe it.

1836
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,640
He didn't accept my friend request.

1837
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:35,740
I failed my interviews.

1838
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:43,740
He's on an alt called Pottymonkey.

1839
01:19:45,430 --> 01:19:47,160
Was that his account name?

1840
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:48,620
Pottymonkey.

1841
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:53,800
Yeah, Pottymonkey.

1842
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:56,300
All right.

1843
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:57,740
After that...

1844
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:00,420
I can't believe it.

1845
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,080
I can't believe he would...

1846
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:02,680
Oh, shit.

1847
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:03,760
Oh, he's in.

1848
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:04,860
I got...

1849
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:05,380
Oh, my God.

1850
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:05,980
We got it.

1851
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:07,720
I got the friend request.

1852
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:08,940
Let's go.

1853
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:10,760
Let's...

1854
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:11,940
Let's go.

1855
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:17,340
Oh, nice.

1856
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:18,000
Oh, my God.

1857
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:18,760
We're still in.

1858
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:19,940
Oh, my God.

1859
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:20,720
He live in this profile.

1860
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:21,760
So, I don't know if he...

1861
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:21,960
Okay.

1862
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:24,300
I don't know if he's like...

1863
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:25,720
If he's like in the...

1864
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:26,280
God damn it.

1865
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:28,200
I need to know if he's like already stacking or not.

1866
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:30,300
I need to know.

1867
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:32,840
I need to know if he's stacking or not.

1868
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:33,680
Okay, queue up.

1869
01:20:34,220 --> 01:20:35,200
Okay, queue up.

1870
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,280
I'm not waiting.

1871
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:38,740
I am not waiting.

1872
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:42,520
Okay.

1873
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:44,680
Are you...

1874
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:46,380
Are you solo too?

1875
01:20:51,220 --> 01:20:52,260
We need to...

1876
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:53,440
We need to kidnap him.

1877
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,020
Twitchy, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

1878
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:56,400
Thank you.

1879
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:57,180
Thank you.

1880
01:20:57,880 --> 01:20:58,900
I need to know.

1881
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:00,360
It's okay.

1882
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:03,460
It's okay, guys.

1883
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:05,100
We taught him a lesson.

1884
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:05,980
Me.

1885
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:09,160
We taught him a lesson he wouldn't forget.

1886
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:10,820
By going...

1887
01:21:10,820 --> 01:21:12,980
Guys, I impressed a Korean pro.

1888
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:15,300
Yes, but I am practicing.

1889
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:21,680
Wanna join Gomez and I?

1890
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:25,700
You can play all the Venom you want.

1891
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:25,980
You can play all the Venom you want.

1892
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:33,720
And there will be no man to sleep.

1893
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:43,640
Fuck.

1894
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:47,300
Yeah.

1895
01:21:54,620 --> 01:21:55,180
Yeah.

1896
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:56,280
I don't think he liked...

1897
01:21:56,280 --> 01:22:00,100
I don't think he liked my man to sleep.

1898
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:01,820
Okay.

1899
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:04,920
Okay, we play one, two.

1900
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:07,020
Alright, nice.

1901
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:07,620
We got him.

1902
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:08,660
We got Chopper.

1903
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:14,200
Yeah.

1904
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,600
Yeah, we do that.

1905
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:16,540
Nice.

1906
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:17,640
We did it.

1907
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:20,860
We did it.

1908
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:21,740
We kidnapped Chopper.

1909
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:23,880
Why he hating?

1910
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:28,880
Cause I was on Mantis and all I did was every time he died me, I just...

1911
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:32,840
Oh shit, he call me Shiva Gosu.

1912
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,520
What if I ban Venom?

1913
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:45,140
Oh my...

1914
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:46,760
That's a huge compliment, guys.

1915
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:48,880
That is a huge compliment.

1916
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:51,000
A Korean pro call me Gosu.

1917
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:53,720
That means really, really good.

1918
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:57,400
I don't know about the Shiva part, but like...

1919
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:00,520
Yippee.

1920
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:02,760
I hope he doesn't lose this one.

1921
01:23:04,220 --> 01:23:06,300
Anyway, okay, we got our Loki skin.

1922
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,040
Okay.

1923
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:09,500
Yeah, she was definitely...

1924
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:14,460
A great Korean word, but when they put Gosu and Shiva together, I don't know.

1925
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:18,680
It sort of, you know, counteracts each other.

1926
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:19,880
So I don't know.

1927
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:21,240
I don't know.

1928
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:24,580
Guys, I know what it means, guys.

1929
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:26,840
I was in...

1930
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:28,860
I played Overwatch 1, guys.

1931
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:32,080
I encountered a lot.

1932
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:32,260
I...

1933
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:42,140
I was in an international school where like 60% of the student population were Korean students.

1934
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:44,140
So like, I learned a lot, guys.

1935
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:47,200
I learned a lot about the Korean ways.

1936
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,940
I learned a lot of swears back then.

1937
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:52,900
But yeah.

1938
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:54,520
It's been fun, though.

1939
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:55,100
I've been enjoying...

1940
01:23:57,240 --> 01:24:03,420
I've been enjoying a lot of just playing Rivalous today for you guys.

1941
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:07,200
I remember why I stopped, because I was getting stream psyched really hard.

1942
01:24:07,820 --> 01:24:10,160
But maybe I'll be better, guys.

1943
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:11,340
I'm on streamer mode now.

1944
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:12,220
Maybe...

1945
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:13,080
Wait, what the fuck?

1946
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:15,560
Wait a minute.

1947
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:18,080
What does NLE mean?

1948
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:19,520
Wait a minute.

1949
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:19,900
Wait.

1950
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:21,580
What the...

1951
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:22,960
Wait.

1952
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:25,480
I tapped...

1953
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:27,680
I lurked away for...

1954
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:30,240
What does NLE mean?

1955
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:32,660
Is that an org?

1956
01:24:33,940 --> 01:24:34,960
What org is that?

1957
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,120
Oh my god, there's two Doki birds.

1958
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:38,440
Oh, is that...

1959
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:39,260
That's Choppa.

1960
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:41,760
That's the real Choppa.

1961
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:42,850
That's...

1962
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,760
That's the real Choppa.

1963
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:49,760
The rapper.

1964
01:24:49,760 --> 01:25:01,120
Guys, when I posted that tweet about Choppa being Don King Kong, people thought it was the actual real rapper who said that.

1965
01:25:01,220 --> 01:25:04,900
And they were like, why are they saying the rapper is Korean?

1966
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:07,060
But people did not realize that.

1967
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:09,760
No, it's not the actual...

1968
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:11,640
Oh shit, guys.

1969
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:12,640
You can steal Sen Gomez.

1970
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:14,080
Guys, do it right now.

1971
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:19,660
Guys, make sure to get a name change right now and become Sen Gomez.

1972
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:21,660
That's his fucking fault.

1973
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:25,620
Guys, it's literally available right now, guys.

1974
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:26,560
I wanna...

1975
01:25:31,150 --> 01:25:35,190
Guys, you can be Sen Gomez.

1976
01:25:35,710 --> 01:25:37,430
People will think you're the real one too.

1977
01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:40,430
Because they didn't realize he...

1978
01:25:41,150 --> 01:25:43,450
They didn't realize he changed his name.

1979
01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:46,290
That's his own fucking fault.

1980
01:25:46,370 --> 01:25:48,170
He could have done this to any other account.

1981
01:25:48,170 --> 01:25:51,610
Why the fuck did he use a Sen Gomez account?

1982
01:25:51,990 --> 01:25:54,950
Guys, sometimes identity theft is a joke.

1983
01:25:55,770 --> 01:25:59,510
Don't you wanna steal someone's identity for like, the rest of his life?

1984
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:05,030
Yeah, I mean he could easily change it on his other account.

1985
01:26:05,210 --> 01:26:05,970
So true.

1986
01:26:06,890 --> 01:26:07,450
Sometimes.

1987
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:14,580
Alright, Larry from HR.

1988
01:26:15,460 --> 01:26:17,800
I think Larry might need to speak to me after what I just said.

1989
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:22,240
Master, thank you for the tier 1 sub.

1990
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:23,280
Thank you, thank you.

1991
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:24,960
Identity theft is fun.

1992
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,260
True hero, thank you for the Twitch prime.

1993
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:32,460
Thank you, thank you.

1994
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:37,100
Yeah, he's gonna have to be like, Sen Gomez 1.

1995
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:37,960
Or...

1996
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:39,980
Right after.

1997
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:42,980
Bro, he'll actually have to like...

1998
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:45,460
He has to be... It's like Bo... Booger.

1999
01:26:45,980 --> 01:26:48,140
Booger's name is like Booger 2.

2000
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:51,220
So like, they have to actually...

2001
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:53,260
He has to not have the original...

2002
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,940
He can't have the original name.

2003
01:26:58,260 --> 01:27:00,500
Oh, fuck.

2004
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,380
Okay, we both have the same idea.

2005
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:03,960
We both hate Groot.

2006
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:05,280
We're all Groot haters.

2007
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:06,360
Thank God.

2008
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:07,550
Alright, I'm gonna go grab...

2009
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:09,240
I'm gonna grab a new tissue box.

2010
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:10,320
Oh, my tissues!

2011
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:12,340
I don't mean myself, man.

2012
01:27:23,550 --> 01:27:25,330
Goodbye, more tissues later.

2013
01:27:27,270 --> 01:27:28,230
Alright, here we go.

2014
01:27:28,850 --> 01:27:30,630
We're Groot aunties together, thank God.

2015
01:27:30,650 --> 01:27:32,270
Yeah, I'm not gonna lie, this comp looks like...

2016
01:27:32,270 --> 01:27:33,550
Thank God we all hate the same.

2017
01:27:34,490 --> 01:27:35,710
My hate is unlimited.

2018
01:27:35,930 --> 01:27:36,170
Horrible.

2019
01:27:39,730 --> 01:27:40,370
Oh, thank God.

2020
01:27:40,990 --> 01:27:42,810
Okay, this comp looks a little better.

2021
01:27:47,890 --> 01:27:49,170
It doesn't look that bad.

2022
01:27:49,370 --> 01:27:51,370
It looks...

2023
01:27:52,290 --> 01:27:53,530
It looks a little better.

2024
01:27:54,630 --> 01:27:55,650
Thank God.

2025
01:27:57,770 --> 01:27:58,670
Sorta better.

2026
01:28:00,630 --> 01:28:02,150
Oh, are we defending or attacking?

2027
01:28:04,430 --> 01:28:05,570
Oh, fuck.

2028
01:28:05,710 --> 01:28:05,870
Okay.

2029
01:28:07,490 --> 01:28:08,650
What do I...

2030
01:28:08,650 --> 01:28:09,430
What do I...

2031
01:28:09,430 --> 01:28:10,990
Oh, okay, I can...

2032
01:28:10,990 --> 01:28:12,450
I can orb the hella.

2033
01:28:13,510 --> 01:28:14,370
Orb the hella.

2034
01:28:15,990 --> 01:28:16,950
Could be worse.

2035
01:28:17,050 --> 01:28:17,370
Oh, yeah.

2036
01:28:17,870 --> 01:28:18,470
Having...

2037
01:28:18,470 --> 01:28:23,390
When our Iron Fist finally swapped off of Iron Fist, the game suddenly got progressively easier.

2038
01:28:24,730 --> 01:28:25,770
That's crazy.

2039
01:28:34,110 --> 01:28:36,890
Doesn't Gomez have a fucking scrim soon?

2040
01:28:37,510 --> 01:28:39,070
Oh, guys, it's not my fault.

2041
01:28:39,930 --> 01:28:41,610
He literally was like...

2042
01:28:41,610 --> 01:28:42,390
I wanna play.

2043
01:28:42,910 --> 01:28:43,150
Like...

2044
01:28:43,150 --> 01:28:44,550
We all saw it.

2045
01:28:44,610 --> 01:28:45,130
We all saw...

2046
01:28:45,130 --> 01:28:46,030
It's not my fault.

2047
01:28:46,330 --> 01:28:47,410
I was solo queuing.

2048
01:28:47,410 --> 01:28:48,710
I was gonna kidnap Choppa.

2049
01:28:51,470 --> 01:28:53,550
Guys, I was gonna kidnap Choppa.

2050
01:28:55,010 --> 01:28:55,810
Okay, I was gonna say...

2051
01:28:55,810 --> 01:28:56,330
Guys, is...

2052
01:28:56,330 --> 01:28:58,250
Okay, I'm gonna say something really fucked up.

2053
01:28:58,510 --> 01:29:00,670
But, like, please note that it's a joke.

2054
01:29:01,910 --> 01:29:03,410
It was not my fault that Sentinels...

2055
01:29:07,510 --> 01:29:08,970
You can't say me.

2056
01:29:13,670 --> 01:29:15,570
It was not my fault.

2057
01:29:17,410 --> 01:29:18,930
I was streaming other shit.

2058
01:29:19,710 --> 01:29:22,150
I wasn't even playing Marvel Rivals.

2059
01:29:28,830 --> 01:29:30,190
They've been...

2060
01:29:30,190 --> 01:29:32,790
They didn't need my meddling to lose those games.

2061
01:29:35,610 --> 01:29:36,670
See, guys?

2062
01:29:36,970 --> 01:29:38,310
Look, it's all a joke though.

2063
01:29:38,730 --> 01:29:39,490
It's all...

2064
01:29:40,270 --> 01:29:41,170
It's all...

2065
01:29:41,170 --> 01:29:43,110
Guys, it's all hee hee ha ha's.

2066
01:29:44,050 --> 01:29:46,090
Until it isn't.

2067
01:29:48,990 --> 01:29:50,010
It's fine.

2068
01:29:50,130 --> 01:29:51,150
Everything is okay.

2069
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:53,950
This is such a dumb comp.

2070
01:29:54,110 --> 01:29:54,810
Not gonna lie.

2071
01:29:57,050 --> 01:29:57,610
Whoops.

2072
01:29:59,710 --> 01:30:01,610
Did not help that...

2073
01:30:01,610 --> 01:30:03,670
I missed my shots a little.

2074
01:30:04,630 --> 01:30:05,130
Okay.

2075
01:30:06,030 --> 01:30:06,930
But, no!

2076
01:30:08,150 --> 01:30:08,910
No!

2077
01:30:09,110 --> 01:30:10,050
I just got killed!

2078
01:30:12,070 --> 01:30:14,470
I just got killed!

2079
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:15,790
No!

2080
01:30:17,550 --> 01:30:17,950
Okay.

2081
01:30:18,650 --> 01:30:19,350
That's good.

2082
01:30:20,910 --> 01:30:21,590
It's okay.

2083
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:23,230
He can do the portal.

2084
01:30:23,730 --> 01:30:24,430
I believe.

2085
01:30:25,070 --> 01:30:25,490
I'll go first.

2086
01:30:25,570 --> 01:30:25,910
I'll go first.

2087
01:30:28,070 --> 01:30:28,890
Where am I?

2088
01:30:29,050 --> 01:30:29,810
Oh, there I am.

2089
01:30:30,810 --> 01:30:31,210
Damage...

2090
01:30:31,210 --> 01:30:31,650
Okay, where?

2091
01:30:31,830 --> 01:30:31,990
Where?

2092
01:30:32,070 --> 01:30:32,570
Oh, I did it!

2093
01:30:32,630 --> 01:30:33,450
I don't know who I...

2094
01:30:33,450 --> 01:30:34,870
I couldn't tell who said that.

2095
01:30:35,950 --> 01:30:36,350
It's fine.

2096
01:30:37,550 --> 01:30:38,090
It's fine.

2097
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:39,850
We did it.

2098
01:30:41,670 --> 01:30:42,750
Wait, what the fuck?

2099
01:30:42,790 --> 01:30:43,830
What is he doing in our spawn?

2100
01:30:45,110 --> 01:30:46,130
Okay, let's go.

2101
01:30:46,130 --> 01:30:47,810
Triple tank, let's go.

2102
01:30:47,810 --> 01:30:48,630
Triple tank, bro.

2103
01:30:48,850 --> 01:30:49,430
Let's go.

2104
01:30:49,570 --> 01:30:50,770
Oh, triple tank, bro.

2105
01:30:50,790 --> 01:30:51,630
Astor said it.

2106
01:30:51,670 --> 01:30:53,150
Okay, I don't know if we...

2107
01:30:53,150 --> 01:30:54,630
He's getting PTSD.

2108
01:30:56,490 --> 01:30:57,730
Triple tank PTSD.

2109
01:30:59,010 --> 01:30:59,530
You know what?

2110
01:30:59,530 --> 01:31:00,790
They should sign me on Set Hills.

2111
01:31:03,990 --> 01:31:05,050
We'll still lose.

2112
01:31:05,170 --> 01:31:06,410
But, like...

2113
01:31:06,410 --> 01:31:07,390
We'll have the more...

2114
01:31:07,390 --> 01:31:09,190
We'll have, like, at least a fun time.

2115
01:31:09,890 --> 01:31:10,250
You know?

2116
01:31:12,490 --> 01:31:13,150
It's true!

2117
01:31:14,530 --> 01:31:16,050
We'll have a fun time!

2118
01:31:17,450 --> 01:31:17,970
Like...

2119
01:31:17,970 --> 01:31:19,650
Like, isn't that what...

2120
01:31:19,650 --> 01:31:20,090
That's bet...

2121
01:31:20,090 --> 01:31:23,510
I mean, if we're gonna lose anyway, at least we'll have fun.

2122
01:31:24,610 --> 01:31:25,090
I...

2123
01:31:25,770 --> 01:31:26,290
Me?!

2124
01:31:27,990 --> 01:31:29,650
I was on a cliff!

2125
01:31:31,470 --> 01:31:32,630
Oh my god.

2126
01:31:33,930 --> 01:31:34,690
That's fucking right.

2127
01:31:36,370 --> 01:31:37,110
That's right.

2128
01:31:37,230 --> 01:31:37,910
It'll be funny.

2129
01:31:38,190 --> 01:31:38,550
Yeah.

2130
01:31:38,770 --> 01:31:39,450
It'll be funny.

2131
01:31:40,890 --> 01:31:42,110
Think of the content.

2132
01:31:42,650 --> 01:31:42,990
Right here.

2133
01:31:43,730 --> 01:31:44,950
Let me know when they're coming.

2134
01:31:45,770 --> 01:31:47,010
Oh, what are you gonna do?

2135
01:31:48,590 --> 01:31:49,530
Oh, they're doing the...

2136
01:31:49,530 --> 01:31:50,450
Doing the stranger.

2137
01:31:52,270 --> 01:31:53,310
Is that a good ult?

2138
01:31:54,030 --> 01:31:55,450
I got nobody!

2139
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:01,570
Wait, he has my name!

2140
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:03,870
Wait, he has my name!

2141
01:32:05,830 --> 01:32:07,590
Oh no, I was out of it.

2142
01:32:07,850 --> 01:32:08,250
No!

2143
01:32:08,570 --> 01:32:10,130
He did that with my name!

2144
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:14,560
No!

2145
01:32:16,020 --> 01:32:17,770
I look like the fool!

2146
01:32:20,420 --> 01:32:21,280
Okay, I didn't...

2147
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:22,680
That is not a joke, guys.

2148
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:24,760
It's not a joke, guys.

2149
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:26,800
My reputation!

2150
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:28,040
No!

2151
01:32:29,740 --> 01:32:31,860
Yeah, that's a dookie replay right there.

2152
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:33,800
Alright, yeah.

2153
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:38,120
Guys, I didn't...

2154
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:39,520
That is not a joke, guys.

2155
01:32:39,860 --> 01:32:42,980
So, make sure you do plays like this...

2156
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:43,500
When you're...

2157
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:44,940
When you're Sen Gomez, guys.

2158
01:32:45,820 --> 01:32:47,620
Make sure it's just like that.

2159
01:32:49,660 --> 01:32:50,840
Jesus Christ, is he alive?

2160
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:51,340
Oh, he is.

2161
01:32:54,020 --> 01:32:54,800
Oh my god.

2162
01:32:55,180 --> 01:32:55,520
It's fine.

2163
01:32:57,580 --> 01:32:58,440
It's fine.

2164
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:01,180
It's okay, everything is okay.

2165
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,580
I mean, he's gonna be okay, so I can...

2166
01:33:06,620 --> 01:33:07,860
Okay, nice.

2167
01:33:08,740 --> 01:33:09,740
He did it.

2168
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:12,660
Can't believe dookie burned through.

2169
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:15,040
Sh...

2170
01:33:16,780 --> 01:33:17,260
Guys!

2171
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:19,760
That's not me!

2172
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:24,700
I said that is not a joke, guys!

2173
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:25,660
I'll ult first.

2174
01:33:31,470 --> 01:33:32,550
Just know that.

2175
01:33:34,030 --> 01:33:34,730
Oh, shit.

2176
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:36,610
Guys, why are they all up here?

2177
01:33:36,710 --> 01:33:37,250
And we're all...

2178
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:39,090
And then me and my Loki are down here.

2179
01:33:39,470 --> 01:33:39,770
Guys.

2180
01:33:40,690 --> 01:33:42,570
Why are they up here and then I'm up here?

2181
01:33:42,610 --> 01:33:44,230
And then I guess I have to do this.

2182
01:33:44,230 --> 01:33:44,790
Oh!

2183
01:33:45,790 --> 01:33:47,010
Oh, fuck!

2184
01:33:47,530 --> 01:33:47,850
Stop!

2185
01:33:48,650 --> 01:33:49,290
He doesn't know.

2186
01:33:51,130 --> 01:33:52,290
There we go.

2187
01:33:52,910 --> 01:33:53,710
The loop, the loop.

2188
01:33:53,830 --> 01:33:54,670
And we're all dead.

2189
01:33:54,930 --> 01:33:55,190
Okay.

2190
01:33:55,850 --> 01:33:56,290
Okay.

2191
01:33:57,110 --> 01:33:57,750
Goodbye.

2192
01:33:58,630 --> 01:33:59,270
Goodbye.

2193
01:34:02,430 --> 01:34:03,510
Okay, look.

2194
01:34:04,290 --> 01:34:06,230
I don't know how that happened.

2195
01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:07,870
How did I throw?

2196
01:34:08,230 --> 01:34:08,850
How?

2197
01:34:09,770 --> 01:34:10,530
Our Loki got...

2198
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:13,630
There's nothing saving our Loki from getting fucking...

2199
01:34:14,290 --> 01:34:16,490
Like dinosaur extinction, dude.

2200
01:34:17,390 --> 01:34:20,730
Where the dinosaur is able to avoid a giant fucking rock?

2201
01:34:20,810 --> 01:34:21,790
I don't think so!

2202
01:34:23,290 --> 01:34:24,910
And dinosaurs are bigger!

2203
01:34:26,530 --> 01:34:27,470
Jesus Christ.

2204
01:34:28,670 --> 01:34:29,270
Wait, wait, wait.

2205
01:34:30,270 --> 01:34:31,010
Okay, I'm behind you.

2206
01:34:31,210 --> 01:34:31,750
You wanna copy?

2207
01:34:38,090 --> 01:34:43,850
Guys, if the dinosaurs can't avoid the meteorite...

2208
01:34:44,810 --> 01:34:46,130
A person will not be...

2209
01:34:46,130 --> 01:34:46,830
Wait, there's a hellbine!

2210
01:34:46,950 --> 01:34:47,390
There's a hellbine!

2211
01:34:49,190 --> 01:34:50,410
Oh, and an invis.

2212
01:34:50,950 --> 01:34:52,370
Okay, I guess fuck me.

2213
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:55,610
It was a skill issue.

2214
01:34:58,350 --> 01:34:59,630
They have strange...

2215
01:35:04,270 --> 01:35:04,870
Oh,

2216
01:35:09,530 --> 01:35:10,110
they're all here!

2217
01:35:12,310 --> 01:35:14,430
Okay, I guess I die.

2218
01:35:16,830 --> 01:35:17,710
It's okay.

2219
01:35:17,710 --> 01:35:19,490
I didn't wanna live.

2220
01:35:20,390 --> 01:35:21,650
That's fine.

2221
01:35:23,230 --> 01:35:26,310
That's okay, I don't think...

2222
01:35:26,310 --> 01:35:27,590
Alright, I...

2223
01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:29,070
I'm waiting.

2224
01:35:29,550 --> 01:35:30,010
Goodbye.

2225
01:35:32,750 --> 01:35:35,730
How did we know the dinosaurs didn't avoid...

2226
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:38,150
Because we have fossils!

2227
01:35:39,730 --> 01:35:41,810
Where do you think they came from?

2228
01:35:41,890 --> 01:35:44,630
The fucking aliens planted dino bones?

2229
01:35:48,650 --> 01:35:51,730
They just flew away like birds.

2230
01:35:53,810 --> 01:35:56,050
Oh, he was trying to do the thing.

2231
01:36:09,530 --> 01:36:11,610
You fucking whore!

2232
01:36:12,590 --> 01:36:14,030
You're such a whore!

2233
01:36:17,710 --> 01:36:20,470
That would've been an insane freeze.

2234
01:36:20,730 --> 01:36:23,630
Why are we still on Thor after that?

2235
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:29,290
Oh my god.

2236
01:36:33,350 --> 01:36:35,530
Guys, I was not throwing.

2237
01:36:41,580 --> 01:36:42,030
Okay.

2238
01:36:43,290 --> 01:36:44,390
They're killing.

2239
01:36:45,610 --> 01:36:46,170
Nice.

2240
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:49,090
That's fine.

2241
01:36:51,310 --> 01:36:52,910
Oh, you can do this?

2242
01:36:53,950 --> 01:36:54,610
Okay.

2243
01:36:55,950 --> 01:36:56,610
Okay.

2244
01:36:58,550 --> 01:36:58,990
Me dead?

2245
01:36:59,670 --> 01:37:00,970
Me not dead?

2246
01:37:01,410 --> 01:37:02,530
Me not dead?

2247
01:37:02,890 --> 01:37:03,690
I guess.

2248
01:37:05,110 --> 01:37:05,570
I'll be dead.

2249
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:07,510
Don't worry, I'll be dead here though.

2250
01:37:08,170 --> 01:37:08,550
Yep.

2251
01:37:12,270 --> 01:37:13,230
It's okay.

2252
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:16,710
I'm not dead there, but I'll be dead here.

2253
01:37:19,170 --> 01:37:22,270
Guys, I don't think Thor was the play anymore.

2254
01:37:22,870 --> 01:37:26,710
For some reason, I felt like...

2255
01:37:27,390 --> 01:37:31,190
I felt like Thor might not have been it.

2256
01:37:32,670 --> 01:37:35,030
I have to go in so he can...

2257
01:37:35,030 --> 01:37:35,950
Okay, there you go.

2258
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:38,910
Where?

2259
01:37:42,710 --> 01:37:43,350
Okay.

2260
01:37:44,110 --> 01:37:45,250
Okay, that's good.

2261
01:37:45,730 --> 01:37:46,730
I'm up here.

2262
01:37:46,730 --> 01:37:48,510
I'm out here.

2263
01:37:49,590 --> 01:37:50,270
Guys.

2264
01:37:50,670 --> 01:37:52,730
Now I feel like...

2265
01:37:53,410 --> 01:37:54,770
Now I'm not as...

2266
01:37:54,770 --> 01:37:56,890
Now I'm not as into the fact that...

2267
01:37:57,270 --> 01:37:59,730
My reputation might be...

2268
01:38:02,950 --> 01:38:05,470
Guys, it's not a Doki Bird play, guys.

2269
01:38:05,930 --> 01:38:08,710
It's not a Doki Bird play.

2270
01:38:12,590 --> 01:38:14,770
Such a huge carry fight.

2271
01:38:15,330 --> 01:38:16,250
You're right, you're right.

2272
01:38:16,250 --> 01:38:16,910
I did...

2273
01:38:16,910 --> 01:38:18,970
I did... Guys, that was crazy.

2274
01:38:19,130 --> 01:38:25,650
I hotboxed my PC so I can play both Strange, Hella, and Luna at the same time, guys.

2275
01:38:25,730 --> 01:38:26,830
It's actually crazy.

2276
01:38:27,010 --> 01:38:27,730
I know.

2277
01:38:28,670 --> 01:38:30,030
How do I do it?

2278
01:38:30,870 --> 01:38:31,350
Just...

2279
01:38:31,350 --> 01:38:32,310
You just gotta have it.

2280
01:38:32,710 --> 01:38:33,770
Dude, you can't learn that.

2281
01:38:33,890 --> 01:38:35,570
You just gotta have it, you know?

2282
01:38:38,890 --> 01:38:40,890
No, it's actually not cheating.

2283
01:38:41,330 --> 01:38:42,650
It's not cheating.

2284
01:38:42,650 --> 01:38:45,890
As long as I'm not throwing, it's not cheating.

2285
01:38:46,470 --> 01:38:49,310
If I was throwing, that's a different question.

2286
01:38:49,550 --> 01:38:52,850
But I am playing out of my fucking mind as two people right now.

2287
01:38:55,650 --> 01:38:57,710
See, we have to give this to her magic.

2288
01:39:00,850 --> 01:39:01,290
Alright,

2289
01:39:05,610 --> 01:39:06,290
we got this.

2290
01:39:06,550 --> 01:39:07,670
We just gotta push it all the way.

2291
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:08,590
How bad can it be?

2292
01:39:11,250 --> 01:39:12,910
How bad can it be?

2293
01:39:13,170 --> 01:39:14,410
See, Larry, it was a good pick.

2294
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:17,350
Don't enable him!

2295
01:39:17,530 --> 01:39:18,050
It was a good pick.

2296
01:39:19,690 --> 01:39:20,210
Okay.

2297
01:39:20,830 --> 01:39:22,010
Where's the other way?

2298
01:39:22,450 --> 01:39:23,390
How do we get out?

2299
01:39:23,410 --> 01:39:24,030
Just wait it out.

2300
01:39:24,370 --> 01:39:25,590
Oh, we gotta wait it out?

2301
01:39:25,670 --> 01:39:27,410
There's no extra door?

2302
01:39:28,010 --> 01:39:29,990
They did not think this...

2303
01:39:29,990 --> 01:39:32,290
How is there no extra door?

2304
01:39:34,930 --> 01:39:37,770
How did they not think this map through?

2305
01:39:38,850 --> 01:39:41,250
There should always be a third door.

2306
01:39:46,510 --> 01:39:47,450
It's fine.

2307
01:39:47,770 --> 01:39:48,930
Everything will be fine.

2308
01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:52,790
I don't feel fine anymore.

2309
01:39:53,830 --> 01:39:55,030
Everything will be fine.

2310
01:39:55,370 --> 01:39:56,290
I still feel fine.

2311
01:39:58,150 --> 01:39:59,670
Everything will be fine.

2312
01:39:59,790 --> 01:40:00,790
I feel so healthy.

2313
01:40:02,590 --> 01:40:04,250
I feel so healthy.

2314
01:40:05,890 --> 01:40:07,630
Don't worry, Larry from HR.

2315
01:40:08,870 --> 01:40:10,050
You'll be fine.

2316
01:40:12,470 --> 01:40:13,630
Oh my god.

2317
01:40:13,790 --> 01:40:14,850
They won't be fine though.

2318
01:40:15,350 --> 01:40:15,990
But it's okay.

2319
01:40:16,290 --> 01:40:17,790
I feel fine though.

2320
01:40:20,170 --> 01:40:21,990
I feel so healthy.

2321
01:40:25,190 --> 01:40:26,470
Oh my god.

2322
01:40:26,570 --> 01:40:26,810
No!

2323
01:40:28,970 --> 01:40:29,910
It's okay.

2324
01:40:30,070 --> 01:40:30,490
We have...

2325
01:40:31,670 --> 01:40:32,270
Loki.

2326
01:40:33,130 --> 01:40:34,150
It's just like Luna.

2327
01:40:34,250 --> 01:40:34,310
Yeah.

2328
01:40:36,850 --> 01:40:39,350
It's like three Lunas if you think about it.

2329
01:40:39,410 --> 01:40:39,950
Honestly, no.

2330
01:40:40,030 --> 01:40:42,190
Loki is actually like three Lunas.

2331
01:40:42,990 --> 01:40:44,070
Oh my gosh.

2332
01:40:44,170 --> 01:40:44,530
My...

2333
01:40:44,530 --> 01:40:45,870
I have a lot of deaths right now.

2334
01:40:46,610 --> 01:40:47,310
This is not good.

2335
01:40:49,350 --> 01:40:49,870
Alright.

2336
01:40:50,190 --> 01:40:51,270
Give it to the magic.

2337
01:40:52,630 --> 01:40:52,910
Alright.

2338
01:40:53,830 --> 01:40:54,750
I'm healthy.

2339
01:40:56,330 --> 01:40:58,190
I feel so healthy right now.

2340
01:40:59,370 --> 01:41:01,350
My team is very healthy too.

2341
01:41:03,390 --> 01:41:04,630
Guys, you didn't see that.

2342
01:41:04,890 --> 01:41:06,150
Guys, my frames are dropping.

2343
01:41:07,010 --> 01:41:07,650
Guys, look.

2344
01:41:07,710 --> 01:41:10,410
I'm not very used to playing with less than 200 frames, guys.

2345
01:41:11,390 --> 01:41:12,430
You have to admit.

2346
01:41:12,830 --> 01:41:14,690
I'm playing with less than 200 frames.

2347
01:41:14,830 --> 01:41:15,390
So like...

2348
01:41:15,390 --> 01:41:16,750
That's why I'm missing shots.

2349
01:41:16,830 --> 01:41:21,190
Because I'm so used to playing with 200 plus frames.

2350
01:41:21,530 --> 01:41:22,130
That like...

2351
01:41:22,130 --> 01:41:22,830
It's not my fault.

2352
01:41:24,430 --> 01:41:24,870
Cool.

2353
01:41:25,030 --> 01:41:25,870
And I'm lagging too.

2354
01:41:26,350 --> 01:41:26,950
Yeah, yeah.

2355
01:41:28,310 --> 01:41:30,930
It just sucks so much, you know, when you're lagging too.

2356
01:41:30,930 --> 01:41:30,970
No?

2357
01:41:31,390 --> 01:41:34,330
Oh, please!

2358
01:41:34,990 --> 01:41:35,790
Thank you, Loki.

2359
01:41:36,970 --> 01:41:38,050
Oh, man.

2360
01:41:38,130 --> 01:41:39,130
That sucks though.

2361
01:41:39,530 --> 01:41:41,610
I can't believe I'm going through it.

2362
01:41:43,310 --> 01:41:44,090
So...

2363
01:41:44,090 --> 01:41:44,330
Fear.

2364
01:41:44,830 --> 01:41:45,510
Fear.

2365
01:41:46,190 --> 01:41:46,970
Fear.

2366
01:41:50,550 --> 01:41:51,330
Fear.

2367
01:41:51,950 --> 01:41:53,630
Okay, that's fine.

2368
01:41:54,450 --> 01:41:55,550
We're fine.

2369
01:41:56,650 --> 01:41:57,570
We're so fine.

2370
01:41:59,610 --> 01:42:00,770
We're so fine.

2371
01:42:02,070 --> 01:42:02,870
We're so...

2372
01:42:02,870 --> 01:42:04,050
We're still so fine.

2373
01:42:06,110 --> 01:42:07,130
Jesus Christ.

2374
01:42:07,230 --> 01:42:08,290
What is going on?

2375
01:42:08,610 --> 01:42:09,890
What is going on?

2376
01:42:11,290 --> 01:42:13,330
I don't know what's going on.

2377
01:42:15,870 --> 01:42:16,570
It's okay.

2378
01:42:16,670 --> 01:42:17,110
We did it.

2379
01:42:17,150 --> 01:42:17,670
See, guys?

2380
01:42:17,790 --> 01:42:18,490
We fucking...

2381
01:42:18,490 --> 01:42:19,630
Nothing to worry about.

2382
01:42:20,730 --> 01:42:21,230
Oh, nice.

2383
01:42:21,390 --> 01:42:21,590
Got her.

2384
01:42:22,550 --> 01:42:23,350
Guys, I'm just...

2385
01:42:23,350 --> 01:42:24,430
I'm lagging right now.

2386
01:42:24,530 --> 01:42:25,330
And like...

2387
01:42:26,150 --> 01:42:28,270
My ping is at 300 ping.

2388
01:42:28,570 --> 01:42:32,010
And I'm playing from Korea at the moment.

2389
01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:33,730
So...

2390
01:42:36,490 --> 01:42:38,910
I know it says 20 ping.

2391
01:42:39,150 --> 01:42:40,450
But like...

2392
01:42:41,050 --> 01:42:42,530
Okay, we made it.

2393
01:42:43,290 --> 01:42:44,550
We made it.

2394
01:42:44,970 --> 01:42:45,550
Guys, look.

2395
01:42:45,630 --> 01:42:46,830
I know it says 24.

2396
01:42:47,170 --> 01:42:48,590
But like, it's a visual bug.

2397
01:42:52,630 --> 01:42:53,410
Oh, man.

2398
01:42:53,410 --> 01:42:58,270
Don't you hate it when you get those visual bugs where it says 24, but you actually have 200 ping?

2399
01:42:59,730 --> 01:43:02,150
Damn, you fucking hate it when that shit happens.

2400
01:43:05,550 --> 01:43:06,070
Please.

2401
01:43:06,770 --> 01:43:07,590
Please kill him.

2402
01:43:08,290 --> 01:43:08,690
Please.

2403
01:43:09,810 --> 01:43:10,330
Please.

2404
01:43:11,650 --> 01:43:12,770
Please kill him.

2405
01:43:16,090 --> 01:43:17,290
I don't know what's going on.

2406
01:43:17,470 --> 01:43:18,590
What's going on?

2407
01:43:18,950 --> 01:43:19,850
Are we winning?

2408
01:43:20,770 --> 01:43:22,330
Yeah, the sun's in my eyes.

2409
01:43:22,370 --> 01:43:23,010
I see it.

2410
01:43:23,550 --> 01:43:24,630
What the fuck?

2411
01:43:28,350 --> 01:43:29,410
I stood still.

2412
01:43:32,590 --> 01:43:34,490
I was like, what hit me?

2413
01:43:35,550 --> 01:43:38,730
A fucking squid inked there.

2414
01:43:39,890 --> 01:43:41,330
The panic ult.

2415
01:43:43,630 --> 01:43:44,390
That's right.

2416
01:43:44,470 --> 01:43:44,950
Oh my god.

2417
01:43:45,030 --> 01:43:45,310
Insane.

2418
01:43:45,490 --> 01:43:46,450
That's me.

2419
01:43:46,930 --> 01:43:48,490
He's talking about me.

2420
01:43:52,850 --> 01:43:53,890
Oh my god.

2421
01:43:53,950 --> 01:43:54,690
Alright, who got...

2422
01:43:54,690 --> 01:43:57,270
So, who got the Sen Gomez tag?

2423
01:43:57,510 --> 01:43:58,390
Did anyone get it?

2424
01:43:59,670 --> 01:44:00,830
Who got the tag?

2425
01:44:01,710 --> 01:44:02,550
That's my streamer.

2426
01:44:02,630 --> 01:44:03,010
Exactly.

2427
01:44:03,110 --> 01:44:03,570
That's me.

2428
01:44:03,670 --> 01:44:04,170
Right there.

2429
01:44:04,310 --> 01:44:05,630
Okay, let's see if Choppa's done.

2430
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:06,050
Alright.

2431
01:44:07,130 --> 01:44:07,650
Invite.

2432
01:44:09,350 --> 01:44:10,390
Choppa's ready.

2433
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:14,230
We might lose, but like, it's okay.

2434
01:44:16,430 --> 01:44:18,630
What elo is Choppa right now?

2435
01:44:19,970 --> 01:44:20,990
Let's see.

2436
01:44:21,570 --> 01:44:22,550
Wait, he's...

2437
01:44:22,550 --> 01:44:23,250
Oh wait, that's five.

2438
01:44:23,450 --> 01:44:24,250
Jesus Christ.

2439
01:44:24,350 --> 01:44:25,650
Choppa's 500?

2440
01:44:26,790 --> 01:44:27,610
That's not...

2441
01:44:27,610 --> 01:44:28,990
We're not playing with that Choppa though.

2442
01:44:29,050 --> 01:44:30,710
We're not playing with that Choppa.

2443
01:44:31,010 --> 01:44:31,890
Okay, he's 290.

2444
01:44:32,330 --> 01:44:32,630
Okay.

2445
01:44:33,090 --> 01:44:34,310
Okay, he's 290 now.

2446
01:44:34,370 --> 01:44:35,770
But he is forcing Venom.

2447
01:44:35,990 --> 01:44:37,550
He is forcing Venom.

2448
01:44:37,770 --> 01:44:38,850
So like...

2449
01:44:38,850 --> 01:44:41,450
He declined my...

2450
01:44:42,390 --> 01:44:43,790
Choppa, where are you?

2451
01:44:49,950 --> 01:44:50,930
Where did...

2452
01:44:51,630 --> 01:44:53,930
Where did Choppa go?

2453
01:44:55,810 --> 01:44:56,910
Did you lose?

2454
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:05,390
Where did he go?

2455
01:45:06,950 --> 01:45:07,650
Oh my God.

2456
01:45:07,710 --> 01:45:09,370
I don't know if he lost or not.

2457
01:45:09,610 --> 01:45:10,890
His profile's private.

2458
01:45:11,110 --> 01:45:12,990
Imagine putting your career profile private.

2459
01:45:13,090 --> 01:45:14,550
I say, couldn't be me.

2460
01:45:16,030 --> 01:45:17,630
Hit him while he's down.

2461
01:45:17,630 --> 01:45:19,150
Alright, I'm fucking...

2462
01:45:19,150 --> 01:45:19,630
We're...

2463
01:45:19,630 --> 01:45:19,950
Okay.

2464
01:45:21,150 --> 01:45:22,170
I think like...

2465
01:45:22,170 --> 01:45:22,670
If you...

2466
01:45:24,250 --> 01:45:25,230
Okay, yeah.

2467
01:45:29,370 --> 01:45:30,390
There you go.

2468
01:45:30,790 --> 01:45:31,850
That's what you get.

2469
01:45:32,030 --> 01:45:33,650
Now you can't spam me.

2470
01:45:35,170 --> 01:45:35,770
Anytime.

2471
01:45:39,090 --> 01:45:39,690
Alright.

2472
01:45:40,990 --> 01:45:41,570
There you go.

2473
01:45:41,830 --> 01:45:42,630
We gotta...

2474
01:45:43,230 --> 01:45:44,110
Why the block?

2475
01:45:44,250 --> 01:45:45,650
Cause then they'll keep spamming it.

2476
01:45:45,910 --> 01:45:46,650
The only way...

2477
01:45:46,650 --> 01:45:47,790
They'll keep spamming it.

2478
01:45:47,850 --> 01:45:48,910
The only way to like...

2479
01:45:48,910 --> 01:45:51,090
Like, not deal with the...

2480
01:45:51,090 --> 01:45:52,650
Spam is just blocking them.

2481
01:45:56,270 --> 01:45:57,990
Guys, I'm trying to...

2482
01:45:57,990 --> 01:46:00,450
Guys, I'm trying to kidnap someone right now.

2483
01:46:00,670 --> 01:46:01,790
Legally kidnap them.

2484
01:46:02,070 --> 01:46:03,070
They consented, guys.

2485
01:46:03,150 --> 01:46:04,010
I'll show you the proof.

2486
01:46:05,750 --> 01:46:06,270
Guys.

2487
01:46:06,750 --> 01:46:08,630
They legally consented to getting kidnapped.

2488
01:46:11,010 --> 01:46:11,950
Where is it?

2489
01:46:13,230 --> 01:46:13,950
Yeah, see?

2490
01:46:14,050 --> 01:46:15,710
If you guys want...

2491
01:46:15,710 --> 01:46:16,590
Go invite.

2492
01:46:16,890 --> 01:46:17,630
There you go.

2493
01:46:18,310 --> 01:46:20,810
That was consensual right there.

2494
01:46:20,890 --> 01:46:22,370
Consensual kidnapping.

2495
01:46:22,790 --> 01:46:24,090
I believe you.

2496
01:46:24,290 --> 01:46:25,910
I don't need proof.

2497
01:46:30,450 --> 01:46:33,030
He didn't decline, chat.

2498
01:46:33,210 --> 01:46:34,790
He didn't willingly decline.

2499
01:46:35,530 --> 01:46:36,670
It's only because...

2500
01:46:37,310 --> 01:46:41,050
It's only because he's AFK, chat.

2501
01:46:41,550 --> 01:46:42,050
He's...

2502
01:46:42,630 --> 01:46:45,110
He's AFK right now.

2503
01:46:45,150 --> 01:46:46,750
And because he's AFK...

2504
01:46:46,750 --> 01:46:48,590
I can't accept him.

2505
01:46:49,070 --> 01:46:51,150
Like, he can't accept it.

2506
01:46:51,390 --> 01:46:54,390
Guys, he is not dodging the stack.

2507
01:46:55,210 --> 01:46:56,630
Guys, I swear to God.

2508
01:46:58,110 --> 01:46:58,930
Oh my God.

2509
01:46:59,130 --> 01:47:01,090
Choppa, where the fuck did you go?

2510
01:47:03,550 --> 01:47:03,910
Maybe...

2511
01:47:04,270 --> 01:47:06,310
Maybe he's crying because he lost.

2512
01:47:06,730 --> 01:47:07,250
I don't know.

2513
01:47:08,870 --> 01:47:09,650
He could be.

2514
01:47:10,710 --> 01:47:11,430
Invite.

2515
01:47:11,850 --> 01:47:12,890
Choppa, please.

2516
01:47:14,730 --> 01:47:15,450
Choppa.

2517
01:47:16,750 --> 01:47:17,510
Oh, there he is.

2518
01:47:17,550 --> 01:47:18,150
He's back.

2519
01:47:20,430 --> 01:47:21,750
Choppa here.

2520
01:47:22,510 --> 01:47:22,930
Q.

2521
01:47:25,850 --> 01:47:28,170
Donkey Kong, man.

2522
01:47:30,570 --> 01:47:31,170
Alright.

2523
01:47:31,610 --> 01:47:32,830
Did you win?

2524
01:47:34,710 --> 01:47:36,050
Did you win?

2525
01:47:37,830 --> 01:47:38,750
Or did...

2526
01:47:39,430 --> 01:47:41,230
Did you win, Choppa?

2527
01:47:42,510 --> 01:47:43,910
Where the fuck did...

2528
01:47:43,910 --> 01:47:44,450
Yo.

2529
01:47:44,450 --> 01:47:47,210
The triple, the double.

2530
01:47:47,850 --> 01:47:48,690
I'm a man.

2531
01:47:49,730 --> 01:47:53,050
What the fuck does that mean?

2532
01:47:54,490 --> 01:47:56,610
Doesn't like NLG.

2533
01:47:58,290 --> 01:48:01,590
But you are NLG, Choppa.

2534
01:48:05,030 --> 01:48:07,450
Why are you...

2535
01:48:08,810 --> 01:48:09,330
Nah.

2536
01:48:11,290 --> 01:48:13,270
But you lost to me.

2537
01:48:14,450 --> 01:48:19,150
Oh my God.

2538
01:48:24,270 --> 01:48:27,470
Unlucky one time.

2539
01:48:29,150 --> 01:48:29,350
Whatever.

2540
01:48:32,330 --> 01:48:32,670
Wait.

2541
01:48:34,770 --> 01:48:37,790
I saw five all sleep.

2542
01:48:42,570 --> 01:48:44,790
Man of man.

2543
01:48:48,830 --> 01:48:50,610
For you too.

2544
01:48:51,410 --> 01:48:52,870
But I'm a...

2545
01:48:52,870 --> 01:48:56,370
Nah, I need one clip for you, man.

2546
01:48:56,890 --> 01:48:59,790
Wow, Choppa's so generous, guys.

2547
01:49:00,770 --> 01:49:02,530
Guys, he's so generous.

2548
01:49:03,330 --> 01:49:05,330
He fucking got me clips.

2549
01:49:06,290 --> 01:49:07,890
He lost so I can...

2550
01:49:07,890 --> 01:49:10,510
I can get clips.

2551
01:49:11,370 --> 01:49:12,530
Oh, okay, okay.

2552
01:49:12,870 --> 01:49:13,510
Group bug.

2553
01:49:14,450 --> 01:49:14,930
Okay.

2554
01:49:15,530 --> 01:49:16,610
We invite again.

2555
01:49:18,950 --> 01:49:19,670
Okay.

2556
01:49:20,290 --> 01:49:21,710
And then...

2557
01:49:22,090 --> 01:49:22,870
There we go.

2558
01:49:23,530 --> 01:49:24,550
He's so generous.

2559
01:49:24,870 --> 01:49:25,910
Oh my God.

2560
01:49:26,910 --> 01:49:27,490
So...

2561
01:49:27,490 --> 01:49:30,390
So nice of him to like...

2562
01:49:30,390 --> 01:49:32,350
Make sure that I win.

2563
01:49:32,530 --> 01:49:33,250
So I can...

2564
01:49:33,550 --> 01:49:34,850
Oh, no, it's still bug.

2565
01:49:35,150 --> 01:49:36,870
Why are you bad at this?

2566
01:49:45,820 --> 01:49:47,420
I believe...

2567
01:49:47,420 --> 01:49:48,800
I am joking.

2568
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:54,720
Identity theft is not a joke.

2569
01:49:56,680 --> 01:49:57,320
Okay.

2570
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:00,500
There you go.

2571
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:01,120
Yeah!

2572
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:04,020
We did it.

2573
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:07,500
We're alive now.

2574
01:50:10,190 --> 01:50:11,690
How are you?

2575
01:50:11,810 --> 01:50:13,250
500 points.

2576
01:50:15,550 --> 01:50:18,870
If you are better than...

2577
01:50:18,870 --> 01:50:21,010
Don't Google me.

2578
01:50:26,710 --> 01:50:28,310
Okay, potty.

2579
01:50:28,410 --> 01:50:30,010
Who's potty monkey?

2580
01:50:40,930 --> 01:50:41,330
Okay.

2581
01:50:41,710 --> 01:50:42,570
Is that act?

2582
01:50:42,590 --> 01:50:43,490
There's no way.

2583
01:50:43,710 --> 01:50:45,710
There's no way.

2584
01:50:46,090 --> 01:50:48,490
There's no fucking way.

2585
01:50:48,970 --> 01:50:49,770
Okay, it's not.

2586
01:50:49,990 --> 01:50:50,210
Okay.

2588
01:50:52,910 --> 01:50:54,470
You don't exist.

2589
01:50:54,470 --> 01:50:56,070

2590
01:50:56,450 --> 01:50:57,510
You are famous?

2591
01:50:59,170 --> 01:51:00,290
Of course.

2592
01:51:01,550 --> 01:51:02,650
Are you lying?

2593
01:51:04,790 --> 01:51:08,590
Do we have any JP people in chat right now?

2594
01:51:09,590 --> 01:51:10,050

2595
01:51:10,050 --> 01:51:10,590

2600
01:51:22,900 --> 01:51:24,440

2601
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:26,180
In my chat?

2602
01:51:26,700 --> 01:51:28,040
Anyone in Japan?

2603
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:29,900
He is a man.

2604
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:30,460
A man.

2605
01:51:30,580 --> 01:51:32,380
The famous potty monkey.

2606
01:51:32,940 --> 01:51:34,700
Just Google man.

2607
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:36,660
Yo, yo.

2608
01:51:36,780 --> 01:51:37,340
Not chat.

2609
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:39,100
Just Google.

2610
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:44,140
Potty monkey is potty monkey.

2611
01:51:45,700 --> 01:51:48,940
I am not JP, but I can confirm.

2612
01:51:49,340 --> 01:51:50,880
I don't know him.

2613
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:56,320
I found potty monkey.

2614
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:57,260
What?

2615
01:51:59,250 --> 01:52:01,620
Wait, he's not even JP.

2616
01:52:02,500 --> 01:52:03,320
It's...

2617
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:04,660
It's Korean.

2618
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:06,880
It's still Korean.

2619
01:52:07,640 --> 01:52:10,700
Wait, there is a potty monkey song.

2620
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:11,720
What the fuck?

2621
01:52:12,520 --> 01:52:13,380
Wait.

2622
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:16,900
There is a potty monkey song.

2623
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:19,340
Oh my god.

2624
01:52:20,990 --> 01:52:22,180
There it is.

2625
01:52:23,700 --> 01:52:24,260
Wait.

2626
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:25,820
You are famous.

2627
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:27,650
You are...

2628
01:52:29,300 --> 01:52:29,990
But...

2629
01:52:30,680 --> 01:52:33,300
Potty monkey is Korean.

2630
01:52:37,230 --> 01:52:37,920
What?

2631
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:43,640
YouTube potty monkey.

2632
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:49,240
He is the potty monkey.

2633
01:52:52,890 --> 01:52:54,840
Oh my god, he is real.

2634
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:58,440
We are gonna boost the viewership.

2635
01:53:01,550 --> 01:53:05,190
Oh my god, we are playing with the potty monkey.

2636
01:53:10,720 --> 01:53:12,620
You are too bad.

2637
01:53:13,160 --> 01:53:14,700
You are not as good.

2638
01:53:15,930 --> 01:53:17,660
Good as Chopper.

2639
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:21,140
Only 200 points.

2640
01:53:33,850 --> 01:53:36,430
Are you sure he is real?

2641
01:53:37,290 --> 01:53:39,890
Yeah, he plays in NA servers with this ping.

2642
01:53:41,950 --> 01:53:44,170
I didn't even see what the song was about.

2643
01:53:44,550 --> 01:53:48,070
I was like, wait, there is a Korean song called potty monkey.

2644
01:53:51,290 --> 01:53:53,330
I can't believe it, he was real.

2645
01:53:53,410 --> 01:53:54,710
He was not shitposting.

2646
01:53:54,710 --> 01:53:56,770
Haha, pun not intended.

2647
01:54:01,990 --> 01:54:02,690
Alright.

2648
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,120
Wanna bar or what?

2649
01:54:09,260 --> 01:54:10,760
The fuck does that mean?

2650
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:13,200
What the fuck?

2651
01:54:20,830 --> 01:54:23,820
I don't know what's wrong with him, I'm sorry.

2652
01:54:29,450 --> 01:54:34,090
He only has 15k more listeners than me.

2653
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:37,510
Okay, I'm banning Groot, I don't fucking care.

2654
01:54:39,730 --> 01:54:42,970
I don't care, I'm not letting potty monkey play Groot.

2655
01:54:43,590 --> 01:54:46,050
I'm not letting him play Groot.

2656
01:54:52,030 --> 01:54:53,830
You said he is playing Venom?

2657
01:54:53,930 --> 01:54:55,330
Fucking let him play Venom.

2658
01:54:59,420 --> 01:55:00,360
Okay, nice.

2659
01:55:00,540 --> 01:55:01,460
Alright, that's fine.

2660
01:55:02,540 --> 01:55:04,080
Is this considered throwing?

2661
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:09,660
Guys, you don't understand, we have the potty monkey on my team.

2662
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:10,980
How could we lose?

2663
01:55:12,500 --> 01:55:13,340
How could we?

2664
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:16,120
How could we lose?

2665
01:55:21,290 --> 01:55:22,390
I hate Groot more.

2666
01:55:23,090 --> 01:55:24,490
I hate Groot more in rank.

2667
01:55:24,490 --> 01:55:25,710
Cause like...

2668
01:55:26,650 --> 01:55:30,510
Cause like, even we have a rocket one trick, it's still sort of winnable.

2669
01:55:31,030 --> 01:55:35,990
But like, having a better Groot player on the enemy team is just like, not it.

2670
01:55:36,710 --> 01:55:37,510
Why we have...

2671
01:55:44,230 --> 01:55:45,590
I'm that good.

2672
01:55:51,330 --> 01:55:53,270
Playing on two PCs.

2673
01:55:56,530 --> 01:55:57,030
Hahaha.

2674
01:56:07,170 --> 01:56:09,050
Yo, you AI.

2675
01:56:18,350 --> 01:56:19,690
I'm just that crack.

2676
01:56:20,210 --> 01:56:21,190
I'm very advanced.

2677
01:56:21,390 --> 01:56:23,570
Technically I am if you think about it.

2678
01:56:24,260 --> 01:56:28,710
If you think about it, I'm technically a very advanced form of AI.

2679
01:56:31,690 --> 01:56:33,410
Don't worry, he'll be fine.

2680
01:56:33,670 --> 01:56:36,130
I believe in potty monkey.

2681
01:56:36,630 --> 01:56:39,150
Number one JP Korean rapper.

2682
01:56:42,270 --> 01:56:42,970
What?

2683
01:56:43,390 --> 01:56:48,660
I was not living that.

2684
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:50,060
Oh, hello.

2685
01:56:54,670 --> 01:56:55,300
Oh, fuck.

2686
01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:56,080
Oh, fuck.

2687
01:56:57,010 --> 01:56:57,700
Oh, fuck.

2688
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:00,220
Oh, fuck.

2689
01:57:00,540 --> 01:57:02,100
I am not living that.

2690
01:57:02,580 --> 01:57:03,600
Oh, my god.

2691
01:57:04,860 --> 01:57:05,980
I'm alive?

2692
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:06,780
Somehow?

2693
01:57:09,260 --> 01:57:10,620
I don't know how.

2694
01:57:12,920 --> 01:57:14,680
I'm a little scared though.

2695
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:19,760
Where is he?

2696
01:57:20,920 --> 01:57:21,920
Where is he?

2697
01:57:23,500 --> 01:57:25,020
Oh, my god.

2698
01:57:25,020 --> 01:57:25,880
No.

2699
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:28,320
Please.

2700
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:29,340
Please.

2701
01:57:32,620 --> 01:57:33,660
It's time.

2702
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:35,780
Guys, we all know what this means.

2703
01:57:36,180 --> 01:57:39,600
I'm ready to pull out the mantis soon.

2704
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:44,640
There's like four different fights.

2705
01:57:45,100 --> 01:57:45,980
There is.

2706
01:57:46,120 --> 01:57:47,440
Oh, my god.

2707
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,580
No, there was four different fights going on.

2708
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:52,620
I was like, what the fuck am I?

2709
01:57:53,480 --> 01:57:54,160
Okay.

2710
01:57:54,920 --> 01:57:56,640
Okay, here we go.

2711
01:57:57,820 --> 01:57:58,260
Goodbye.

2712
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:01,720
Yeah, yeah, damage.

2713
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:02,140
I'm damaged.

2714
01:58:04,380 --> 01:58:04,720
Okay.

2715
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:06,520
Oh, goodbye.

2716
01:58:07,660 --> 01:58:08,820
Oh, no.

2717
01:58:09,120 --> 01:58:10,260
That's where I die.

2718
01:58:14,280 --> 01:58:15,880
I'm coming back.

2719
01:58:17,260 --> 01:58:18,220
Oh, shit.

2720
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:18,880
Fear god.

2721
01:58:20,720 --> 01:58:23,660
Why the fuck is there a partymonkey.com?

2722
01:58:29,300 --> 01:58:30,660
Oh, goodbye.

2723
01:58:33,080 --> 01:58:34,440
Oh, please.

2724
01:58:34,820 --> 01:58:36,620
I will go mantis.

2725
01:58:36,700 --> 01:58:37,640
I'm going mantis.

2726
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:46,060
I will go mantis if I have to.

2727
01:58:46,060 --> 01:58:49,840
I will go mantis.

2728
01:58:50,500 --> 01:58:53,040
I will go mantis if I have to.

2729
01:58:56,550 --> 01:58:58,330
I know what to do.

2730
01:59:01,950 --> 01:59:02,950
It's okay.

2731
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:08,640
It's okay.

2732
01:59:11,680 --> 01:59:13,060
That's fucking right.

2733
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:14,340
That's right.

2734
01:59:15,560 --> 01:59:17,940
I'm gonna do that thing I did.

2735
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:22,920
Okay.

2736
01:59:23,980 --> 01:59:24,900
It's fine.

2737
01:59:28,420 --> 01:59:29,060
Okay.

2738
01:59:33,180 --> 01:59:35,000
What the fuck is this?

2739
01:59:35,360 --> 01:59:36,200
What is this?

2740
01:59:36,500 --> 01:59:37,840
What does this say?

2741
01:59:40,160 --> 01:59:41,040
Oh, shit.

2742
01:59:44,760 --> 01:59:45,800
Oh, my god.

2743
01:59:46,040 --> 01:59:47,020
Oh, my god.

2744
01:59:47,260 --> 01:59:47,620
Fuck.

2745
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:50,540
I didn't know where to go.

2746
01:59:52,280 --> 01:59:53,640
I didn't know where to go.

2747
01:59:53,700 --> 01:59:55,960
I was just getting harassed all day.

2748
01:59:57,560 --> 01:59:59,360
What is... I don't know.

2749
01:59:59,480 --> 02:00:00,740
I don't know what he's saying.

2750
02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:04,600
Okay, I wait.

2751
02:00:06,100 --> 02:00:06,700
I wait.

2752
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:09,400
Oh, my god.

2753
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:09,600
See?

2754
02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:11,420
This is how you rocket one trick.

2755
02:00:11,420 --> 02:00:18,760
Okay, to be fair, what we had before, that other guy, the deleted guy getting...

2756
02:00:19,280 --> 02:00:22,740
Our rocket actually going through hell, living through everything possible.

2757
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:26,460
That's crazy.

2758
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:29,680
Versus like...

2759
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:29,960
Alright.

2760
02:00:33,500 --> 02:00:33,780
Okay.

2761
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:37,580
Oh, fuck.

2762
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:37,880
Okay.

2763
02:00:37,880 --> 02:00:39,120
Okay.

2764
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,120
Oh, fuck.

2765
02:00:41,240 --> 02:00:42,240
He actually got me.

2766
02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:43,360
But no, it's okay.

2767
02:00:43,500 --> 02:00:44,280
I'm alive.

2768
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:50,080
That's fine.

2769
02:00:51,680 --> 02:00:52,680
Oh, my god.

2770
02:00:52,720 --> 02:00:54,240
He actually flew away.

2771
02:00:55,220 --> 02:00:56,020
That's crazy.

2772
02:00:57,060 --> 02:00:58,920
He actually flew away.

2773
02:00:59,940 --> 02:01:01,440
Who's gonna save him?

2774
02:01:01,680 --> 02:01:03,560
Cause it's definitely not me.

2775
02:01:05,580 --> 02:01:08,120
I need someone to save me first.

2776
02:01:10,840 --> 02:01:12,620
Oh, my god.

2777
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:16,720
Okay.

2778
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:20,060
I'll go Luna again after this.

2779
02:01:21,620 --> 02:01:22,900
This is unlucky.

2780
02:01:25,880 --> 02:01:26,160
Okay.

2781
02:01:33,980 --> 02:01:36,220
I go back to...

2782
02:01:36,220 --> 02:01:38,520
I go back to Luna.

2783
02:01:39,680 --> 02:01:40,240
LOL.

2784
02:01:42,700 --> 02:01:45,140
Surely, it won't be as bad now.

2785
02:01:45,900 --> 02:01:46,320
Right?

2786
02:01:47,740 --> 02:01:49,420
Guys, I go back to Luna.

2787
02:01:49,540 --> 02:01:51,000
It won't be as bad, right?

2788
02:01:51,340 --> 02:01:53,080
We just lost both supports?

2789
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:53,820
Question mark.

2790
02:01:53,820 --> 02:01:54,240
No, we did.

2791
02:01:54,680 --> 02:01:55,040
We did.

2792
02:01:55,240 --> 02:01:55,420
Okay.

2793
02:01:55,780 --> 02:01:56,220
That's good.

2794
02:01:59,500 --> 02:02:00,060
Okay.

2795
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:01,720
There we go.

2796
02:02:04,020 --> 02:02:04,860
It's fine.

2797
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:06,640
It's so fine.

2798
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:09,720
It's not, but like, you know, I like to cope sometimes.

2799
02:02:12,040 --> 02:02:12,520
Oh.

2800
02:02:13,900 --> 02:02:14,380
No.

2801
02:02:15,100 --> 02:02:15,580
Choppa.

2802
02:02:18,200 --> 02:02:18,680
No.

2803
02:02:19,860 --> 02:02:20,620
There we go.

2804
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:21,900
Oh, fuck.

2805
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:22,680
Oh, shit.

2806
02:02:23,260 --> 02:02:24,760
Okay, there was a lot...

2807
02:02:24,760 --> 02:02:28,040
There's a lot of stuff going on on my screen and I don't know who's who.

2808
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:34,800
There's a lot of stuff on my screen and I'm getting very confused.

2809
02:02:35,740 --> 02:02:36,860
Oh, I missed.

2810
02:02:37,220 --> 02:02:37,720
I missed.

2811
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:39,120
That's fine.

2812
02:02:41,780 --> 02:02:42,460
Okay.

2813
02:02:45,760 --> 02:02:46,760
It's okay.

2814
02:02:46,920 --> 02:02:49,900
It's not, but like, we used a lot for zero kills.

2815
02:02:50,760 --> 02:02:51,100
So...

2816
02:02:51,800 --> 02:02:52,760
That's good.

2817
02:02:52,860 --> 02:02:53,280
That's...

2818
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:54,580
Oh, no.

2819
02:02:55,480 --> 02:02:56,340
I'm on the thing.

2820
02:02:58,200 --> 02:02:58,880
Please.

2821
02:02:59,580 --> 02:02:59,900
Please.

2822
02:03:01,240 --> 02:03:02,600
Oh, please.

2823
02:03:02,940 --> 02:03:03,440
No!

2824
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:05,760
I'm 2%!

2825
02:03:07,540 --> 02:03:09,460
No, and I didn't get...

2826
02:03:13,810 --> 02:03:14,930
Oh, no.

2827
02:03:18,690 --> 02:03:19,930
Oh, no.

2828
02:03:21,410 --> 02:03:22,030
I'm on it.

2829
02:03:22,230 --> 02:03:23,230
I'm fucking on it.

2830
02:03:23,970 --> 02:03:24,590
I dance.

2831
02:03:25,130 --> 02:03:26,710
I die, but I dance.

2832
02:03:27,650 --> 02:03:27,930
I...

2833
02:03:27,930 --> 02:03:30,090
I die, but...

2834
02:03:30,090 --> 02:03:30,850
I dance.

2835
02:03:32,610 --> 02:03:34,810
Oh, I definitely die here.

2836
02:03:40,670 --> 02:03:41,310
What?

2837
02:03:41,310 --> 02:03:41,510
Oh, man.

2838
02:03:42,110 --> 02:03:42,750
What?

2839
02:03:43,490 --> 02:03:44,390
Oh, man.

2840
02:03:44,470 --> 02:03:45,870
I definitely die here.

2841
02:03:46,450 --> 02:03:47,090
Oh!

2842
02:03:47,850 --> 02:03:48,770
Fuck you!

2843
02:03:49,030 --> 02:03:50,650
Why don't you have a kill?

2844
02:03:50,810 --> 02:03:51,370
Fuck you!

2845
02:03:54,570 --> 02:03:55,210
Fuck you!

2846
02:03:55,470 --> 02:03:56,650
One kill!

2847
02:03:56,950 --> 02:03:57,270
Please!

2848
02:04:04,700 --> 02:04:06,020
Oh, my god!

2849
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:09,000
It's okay.

2850
02:04:09,620 --> 02:04:11,140
Things could be okay.

2851
02:04:13,580 --> 02:04:15,000
It's okay.

2852
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:20,340
Oh, my god.

2853
02:04:20,440 --> 02:04:22,010
I don't...

2854
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:29,580
Please!

2855
02:04:32,440 --> 02:04:34,660
Why is he still there?

2856
02:04:38,650 --> 02:04:40,200
Oh, my...

2857
02:04:51,070 --> 02:04:52,190
I'm alive.

2858
02:04:58,210 --> 02:04:59,120
Oh, please.

2859
02:04:59,120 --> 02:05:00,460
Oh, please.

2860
02:05:00,700 --> 02:05:02,300
Oh, I'm alive!

2861
02:05:03,200 --> 02:05:03,680
Somehow!

2862
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:09,760
Nice.

2863
02:05:10,740 --> 02:05:12,540
This is where I die, too.

2864
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:15,320
Goodbye!

2865
02:05:17,080 --> 02:05:17,660
Hello?

2866
02:05:21,940 --> 02:05:23,440
I think...

2867
02:05:23,940 --> 02:05:24,440
How?

2868
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:25,700
Holy shit!

2869
02:05:25,740 --> 02:05:26,820
He's on killable!

2870
02:05:29,120 --> 02:05:30,200
Oh, my god!

2871
02:05:31,020 --> 02:05:33,240
Why couldn't he do that when he was...

2872
02:05:33,900 --> 02:05:34,880
Oh, my god!

2873
02:05:36,540 --> 02:05:37,900
He's actually...

2874
02:05:39,340 --> 02:05:41,420
Why couldn't he do that before?

2875
02:05:47,340 --> 02:05:50,480
Why couldn't he do that before?

2876
02:05:53,080 --> 02:05:54,640
Why couldn't he?

2877
02:05:55,420 --> 02:05:56,520
Oh, my god!

2878
02:05:59,580 --> 02:06:03,800
I've been struggling so hard!

2879
02:06:06,220 --> 02:06:08,620
Oh, my god!

2880
02:06:15,080 --> 02:06:16,820
He's Japanese.

2881
02:06:20,220 --> 02:06:24,940
Oh, my god!

2882
02:06:25,680 --> 02:06:26,940
He does not represent...

2883
02:06:28,100 --> 02:06:29,760
Oh, my god!

2884
02:06:30,120 --> 02:06:32,560
He does not represent...

2885
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:32,980
Guys!

2886
02:06:33,280 --> 02:06:33,700
Guys!

2887
02:06:33,900 --> 02:06:34,300
Guys!

2888
02:06:34,360 --> 02:06:35,940
He does not represent...

2889
02:06:36,680 --> 02:06:38,020
Guys, this is...

2890
02:06:38,020 --> 02:06:39,200
He's Chopper, guys.

2891
02:06:39,240 --> 02:06:41,020
He does not represent our group.

2892
02:06:41,360 --> 02:06:44,200
He does not represent our group, guys.

2893
02:06:44,700 --> 02:06:47,120
He does not represent my views, guys.

2894
02:06:49,580 --> 02:06:51,300
Oh, my god!

2895
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:54,120
Chopper...

2896
02:06:54,940 --> 02:06:55,900
Oh, my god!

2897
02:06:58,520 --> 02:07:00,620
He got a potty mouth.

2898
02:07:06,940 --> 02:07:11,100
Guys, please don't cancel me.

2899
02:07:11,220 --> 02:07:11,660
It's not my...

2900
02:07:11,660 --> 02:07:12,920
Please don't cancel me, guys.

2901
02:07:13,380 --> 02:07:13,640
Please.

2902
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:14,780
Please.

2903
02:07:15,340 --> 02:07:15,780
Please.

2904
02:07:16,280 --> 02:07:16,940
I hate...

2905
02:07:20,860 --> 02:07:22,460
Why couldn't he do this?

2906
02:07:22,660 --> 02:07:24,200
Guys, we just gotta go triple team.

2907
02:07:24,200 --> 02:07:25,380
The last time...

2908
02:07:26,020 --> 02:07:28,480
He couldn't do anything when he was on triple team, guys.

2909
02:07:28,580 --> 02:07:29,160
That's the key.

2910
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:31,700
He literally couldn't do jack shit on triple.

2911
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:32,240
Wait.

2912
02:07:32,680 --> 02:07:33,180
What?

2913
02:07:34,040 --> 02:07:35,280
Did he just lag there?

2914
02:07:35,400 --> 02:07:36,520
Like, what the fuck was that?

2915
02:07:39,120 --> 02:07:40,480
What the fuck?

2916
02:07:40,960 --> 02:07:42,300
What happened to him?

2917
02:07:42,860 --> 02:07:43,500
Iron Fist left.

2918
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:49,280
Iron Fist behind us.

2919
02:07:53,260 --> 02:07:54,380
Oh, my god.

2920
02:07:54,380 --> 02:07:54,760
How?

2921
02:07:54,840 --> 02:07:57,320
He got shielded from back there?

2922
02:07:57,700 --> 02:07:58,520
That's crazy.

2923
02:07:58,780 --> 02:07:59,580
That's actually crazy.

2924
02:08:04,680 --> 02:08:06,420
That's actually crazy.

2925
02:08:07,560 --> 02:08:09,520
He actually got, like...

2926
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:14,320
Shielded all the way from back there, like...

2927
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:14,700
Oh.

2928
02:08:15,560 --> 02:08:17,220
He potty monkey alive.

2929
02:08:20,980 --> 02:08:23,220
That was, like, actually to nowhere.

2930
02:08:24,020 --> 02:08:24,640
Not nowhere.

2931
02:08:24,760 --> 02:08:25,440
I was setting that.

2932
02:08:29,940 --> 02:08:30,680
It's okay.

2933
02:08:30,760 --> 02:08:31,240
He's alive.

2934
02:08:31,300 --> 02:08:31,840
He's alive.

2935
02:08:34,160 --> 02:08:35,460
Why follow me?

2936
02:08:35,900 --> 02:08:37,020
Why follow me?

2937
02:08:42,380 --> 02:08:43,020
Alright.

2938
02:08:43,340 --> 02:08:43,820
That's fine.

2939
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:45,920
That's fine.

2940
02:08:47,860 --> 02:08:48,780
That's fine.

2941
02:08:49,600 --> 02:08:51,100
I'm damage boosting this.

2942
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:51,760
It's okay.

2943
02:08:53,220 --> 02:08:54,740
It's not okay, but it's okay.

2944
02:08:54,980 --> 02:08:55,900
Let me get rid of this.

2945
02:08:57,140 --> 02:08:58,140
Oh, my god.

2946
02:08:58,480 --> 02:08:59,840
Oh, my god.

2947
02:09:00,260 --> 02:09:01,140
Where am I?

2948
02:09:01,820 --> 02:09:03,440
Oh, my god.

2949
02:09:15,030 --> 02:09:15,990
Oh, my god.

2950
02:09:16,010 --> 02:09:17,510
He waited for me.

2951
02:09:20,290 --> 02:09:22,250
Why couldn't he do that when he...

2952
02:09:22,250 --> 02:09:23,530
Oh, because they were on triple tank.

2953
02:09:23,730 --> 02:09:24,630
They were on triple tank.

2954
02:09:25,150 --> 02:09:25,650
That's why.

2955
02:09:26,670 --> 02:09:28,170
That's why he couldn't do anything.

2956
02:09:29,750 --> 02:09:31,010
I remember now.

2957
02:09:31,190 --> 02:09:32,850
He was useless on Iron Fist.

2958
02:09:33,010 --> 02:09:34,230
When there was triple tank.

2959
02:09:35,410 --> 02:09:36,470
Guys, I remember.

2960
02:09:38,610 --> 02:09:40,530
Guys, I remember now.

2961
02:09:47,010 --> 02:09:48,050
Jesus Christ.

2962
02:09:50,790 --> 02:09:51,310
I...

2963
02:09:51,310 --> 02:09:52,250
Okay.

2964
02:09:52,770 --> 02:09:53,810
I froze him.

2965
02:09:53,890 --> 02:09:55,150
What more do you want from me?

2966
02:09:56,570 --> 02:09:59,550
I did everything I was supposed to do with my job.

2967
02:10:01,790 --> 02:10:03,610
I don't have another freeze.

2968
02:10:05,510 --> 02:10:06,990
Only 60 seconds left.

2969
02:10:06,990 --> 02:10:07,650
I get one.

2970
02:10:09,070 --> 02:10:10,650
Guys, I think...

2971
02:10:10,650 --> 02:10:12,850
I think PartyMouth is gonna lose.

2972
02:10:13,970 --> 02:10:14,470
I have ult.

2973
02:10:14,670 --> 02:10:18,450
I think he might...

2974
02:10:19,050 --> 02:10:20,490
Okay, I missed the freeze.

2975
02:10:20,910 --> 02:10:23,190
Look, I cannot hit every freeze, guys.

2976
02:10:27,810 --> 02:10:28,650
He's looking.

2977
02:10:29,010 --> 02:10:29,410
He's looking.

2978
02:10:31,190 --> 02:10:34,250
Oh, my god.

2979
02:10:34,570 --> 02:10:36,150
Oh, my god.

2980
02:10:36,230 --> 02:10:36,910
Please.

2981
02:10:39,450 --> 02:10:39,930
Please.

2982
02:10:43,090 --> 02:10:44,830
That was insane.

2983
02:10:45,270 --> 02:10:46,690
That was a really good damage boost.

2984
02:10:47,670 --> 02:10:48,250
There we go.

2985
02:10:49,310 --> 02:10:49,770
Did they live?

2986
02:10:49,850 --> 02:10:50,470
Did the Venom live?

2987
02:10:51,990 --> 02:10:52,690
Chopper.

2988
02:10:56,390 --> 02:10:57,690
NLE Chopper.

2989
02:11:05,990 --> 02:11:06,430
Oh, shit.

2990
02:11:08,230 --> 02:11:09,090
Oh, fuck.

2991
02:11:09,250 --> 02:11:09,830
I can't stay.

2992
02:11:09,990 --> 02:11:11,050
I'm not focusing.

2993
02:11:12,830 --> 02:11:23,570
Oh, my god.

2994
02:11:25,150 --> 02:11:26,150
I don't know.

2995
02:11:26,350 --> 02:11:26,670
Fuck.

2996
02:11:29,990 --> 02:11:30,750
Oh, my god.

2997
02:11:30,770 --> 02:11:31,090
We're okay.

2998
02:11:31,170 --> 02:11:31,490
We're okay.

2999
02:11:32,610 --> 02:11:33,290
We're okay.

3000
02:11:34,190 --> 02:11:35,110
Now he's dead.

3001
02:11:40,980 --> 02:11:42,340
Holy shit.

3002
02:11:43,340 --> 02:11:44,680
Holy shit.

3003
02:11:44,840 --> 02:11:46,500
Chopper's fucking wild.

3004
02:11:50,020 --> 02:11:53,920
Oh, my god.

3005
02:11:54,420 --> 02:11:55,420
Oh, my god.

3006
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:57,400
Did not realize he's so wild.

3007
02:11:57,840 --> 02:12:00,440
He's so fucking wild, guys.

3008
02:12:05,100 --> 02:12:06,680
Jesus Christ.

3009
02:12:07,440 --> 02:12:09,880
He is an animal.

3010
02:12:13,340 --> 02:12:14,940
He is a fucking animal.

3011
02:12:17,780 --> 02:12:19,320
Oh, my god.

3012
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:21,540
Please.

3013
02:12:26,340 --> 02:12:29,500
Are we dancing?

3014
02:12:30,240 --> 02:12:31,060
I'm not.

3015
02:12:35,900 --> 02:12:37,840
Oh, my god.

3016
02:12:37,880 --> 02:12:39,980
Oh, my god.

3017
02:12:40,440 --> 02:12:42,720
He just beat the shit out of me.

3018
02:12:43,320 --> 02:12:45,200
That's so fucked up.

3019
02:12:46,860 --> 02:12:49,580
He literally just beat the shit out of me.

3020
02:12:49,860 --> 02:12:52,080
What do I do?

3021
02:12:52,080 --> 02:12:53,080
Oh, my god.

3022
02:12:57,340 --> 02:13:01,740
I had Iron Fist and Venom just pummeling me.

3023
02:13:02,840 --> 02:13:05,600
Like, what do I do in that situation?

3024
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:07,100
I just die?

3025
02:13:09,780 --> 02:13:11,660
Yeah, I guess I do.

3026
02:13:17,160 --> 02:13:19,300
Oh, my god.

3027
02:13:19,620 --> 02:13:20,000
Oh, my god.

3028
02:13:20,460 --> 02:13:21,860
Oh, my god.

3029
02:13:21,860 --> 02:13:21,880
No!

3030
02:13:24,840 --> 02:13:25,480
He

3031
02:13:34,440 --> 02:13:36,240
killed us through everything.

3032
02:13:36,580 --> 02:13:38,600
He killed us through everything.

3033
02:13:39,040 --> 02:13:40,160
What happened?

3034
02:13:42,640 --> 02:13:43,640
Oh, my god.

3035
02:13:44,760 --> 02:13:47,040
He actually killed us through everything.

3036
02:13:47,300 --> 02:13:47,940
That's crazy.

3037
02:13:48,880 --> 02:13:50,040
Oh, I had a feeling.

3038
02:13:50,340 --> 02:13:52,240
I... Oh, my...

3039
02:13:52,240 --> 02:13:54,340
Oh, my god.

3040
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:59,080
I don't know how I got that fucking freeze in, but I take those.

3041
02:14:01,620 --> 02:14:02,600
I take those.

3042
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:06,820
Oh, I missed the freeze, though.

3043
02:14:07,740 --> 02:14:08,460
That's not good.

3044
02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:12,360
Nice.

3045
02:14:13,220 --> 02:14:14,480
What's going on?

3046
02:14:14,500 --> 02:14:15,520
I'll never know.

3047
02:14:19,640 --> 02:14:20,460
Oh, fuck.

3048
02:14:22,880 --> 02:14:24,700
Guys, I don't know.

3049
02:14:24,820 --> 02:14:26,780
Things ain't looking so good for us.

3050
02:14:27,780 --> 02:14:28,760
I don't know.

3051
02:14:31,440 --> 02:14:32,560
Things are...

3052
02:14:32,560 --> 02:14:34,820
Things are looking pretty rough.

3053
02:14:39,740 --> 02:14:41,800
I'm a little scared.

3054
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:49,740
Oh, my god.

3055
02:14:50,520 --> 02:14:51,360
I'm so scared.

3056
02:14:52,020 --> 02:14:53,060
I'm so scared.

3057
02:14:53,680 --> 02:14:55,260
Oh, this is where he's gonna beat me up.

3058
02:14:55,520 --> 02:14:56,280
He's gonna...

3059
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:02,680
Okay.

3060
02:15:03,780 --> 02:15:04,880
Oh, shit.

3061
02:15:05,020 --> 02:15:05,340
Nice.

3062
02:15:08,260 --> 02:15:09,020
Nice.

3063
02:15:11,400 --> 02:15:12,520
Oh, my god.

3064
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:16,620
Oh, my god.

3065
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:21,020
This is good.

3066
02:15:21,140 --> 02:15:21,760
This is good.

3067
02:15:22,200 --> 02:15:23,780
Our damage boost.

3068
02:15:25,400 --> 02:15:26,400
Oh, I leave.

3069
02:15:27,400 --> 02:15:28,360
I leave.

3070
02:15:28,360 --> 02:15:28,760
I'm fine, thank you.

3071
02:15:28,860 --> 02:15:29,820
I'm fine, thank you.

3072
02:15:33,580 --> 02:15:35,600
I'm fine, thank you.

3073
02:15:39,680 --> 02:15:41,100
Guys, do you think he's fine?

3074
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:43,420
He said he's fine.

3075
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,060
He's like, I'm fine, thank you.

3076
02:15:46,420 --> 02:15:46,680
No!

3077
02:15:50,140 --> 02:15:51,480
Good for you.

3078
02:15:51,980 --> 02:15:53,800
Good for you, Chapa.

3079
02:15:58,360 --> 02:16:01,240
Guys, I was not having a great game there.

3080
02:16:01,440 --> 02:16:06,540
I was fucking getting pummeled non-stop.

3081
02:16:06,720 --> 02:16:08,360
Like, I was...

3082
02:16:09,560 --> 02:16:13,040
I was getting pummeled non-stop.

3083
02:16:19,180 --> 02:16:19,940
I was getting... Wait.

3084
02:16:21,380 --> 02:16:22,020
Venom.

3085
02:16:22,520 --> 02:16:23,820
Venom tip.

3086
02:16:23,820 --> 02:16:24,000
Venom tip.

3087
02:16:29,640 --> 02:16:32,120
Chapa would never lose that.

3088
02:16:39,910 --> 02:16:42,010
Did you avoid DPS?

3089
02:16:44,470 --> 02:16:46,370
He is honest.

3090
02:16:49,670 --> 02:16:50,890
Okay, nice.

3091
02:16:51,670 --> 02:16:52,630
DPS avoided.

3092
02:16:54,190 --> 02:16:58,230
Yeah, our other DPS was not having a good time too.

3093
02:16:58,550 --> 02:17:02,390
He had more... Surprisingly, he had more deaths than me.

3094
02:17:02,550 --> 02:17:08,430
Which is very surprising because I was having a really rough time as Mantis and Luna.

3095
02:17:08,490 --> 02:17:12,890
Like, I had to go Mantis first because I was literally, like, having a rough time.

3096
02:17:14,090 --> 02:17:17,270
Because I was not getting any peeled at all.

3097
02:17:17,470 --> 02:17:19,070
So I was trying to see if I could just sleep them.

3098
02:17:19,070 --> 02:17:19,910
But then...

3099
02:17:19,910 --> 02:17:21,950
But then, things did not...

3100
02:17:21,950 --> 02:17:25,050
And then I swapped to Luna because I was like, okay, maybe...

3101
02:17:25,050 --> 02:17:26,730
Maybe I can make it work.

3102
02:17:27,230 --> 02:17:27,710
Maybe.

3103
02:17:31,050 --> 02:17:33,350
Maybe I can make it work, guys.

3104
02:17:35,690 --> 02:17:38,790
Yeah, our Winter Soldier was not having a good time.

3105
02:17:38,890 --> 02:17:39,430
Oh, Suta!

3106
02:17:39,690 --> 02:17:40,850
Thank you for the raid!

3107
02:17:41,050 --> 02:17:42,170
Thank you, thank you!

3108
02:17:42,230 --> 02:17:44,310
I didn't know it was your raid earlier, but thank you!

3109
02:17:44,590 --> 02:17:47,190
I was having a really rough time earlier.

3110
02:17:48,550 --> 02:17:51,410
With, like, 200 people trying to kill me.

3111
02:17:51,570 --> 02:17:53,590
And then I got Strange Ulted.

3112
02:17:53,690 --> 02:17:54,870
I got Venom Ulted.

3113
02:17:54,970 --> 02:17:57,990
I ulted and I still died through my ult.

3114
02:17:58,350 --> 02:17:59,250
Nothing was okay.

3115
02:18:00,670 --> 02:18:02,530
Nothing was okay for me.

3116
02:18:03,350 --> 02:18:05,710
I was just meant to die, I think.

3117
02:18:06,370 --> 02:18:07,810
But yes, thank you for the raid!

3118
02:18:07,850 --> 02:18:09,750
For those who don't know me, my name is DokiVirid.

3119
02:18:09,770 --> 02:18:12,010
I usually stream on YouTube, so please check me out on YouTube.

3120
02:18:13,030 --> 02:18:15,570
But I have a recent partnership with Marble Rivals.

3121
02:18:15,930 --> 02:18:20,390
And that requires me to stream an X amount of hours per month for Marble Rivals.

3122
02:18:20,690 --> 02:18:22,530
So that's why I'm doing it here on Twitch now.

3123
02:18:23,010 --> 02:18:27,610
Just to make sure I meet the quota that I need to do for each month.

3124
02:18:27,710 --> 02:18:28,270
But yes, hello!

3125
02:18:28,430 --> 02:18:29,150
Welcome, everybody!

3126
02:18:29,670 --> 02:18:34,530
I am playing Marble Rivals Ranked with NLE Choppa and Super Gomez right now.

3127
02:18:34,590 --> 02:18:36,830
For those who don't know, they are actually really, really good players.

3128
02:18:38,930 --> 02:18:41,890
They were willing to get kidnapped by me.

3129
02:18:41,890 --> 02:18:44,530
To play ranked.

3130
02:18:44,930 --> 02:18:47,130
For those who don't know what their mains are.

3131
02:18:47,550 --> 02:18:48,630
So this is Choppa.

3132
02:18:49,050 --> 02:18:51,790
He is literally 502 points right now.

3133
02:18:52,230 --> 02:18:55,330
And then, Gomez's main is 426.

3134
02:18:55,690 --> 02:18:57,550
And I'm just, I guess, a baby.

3135
02:18:58,010 --> 02:18:58,530
I'm a baby.

3136
02:18:58,750 --> 02:19:00,470
I only have 326 points.

3137
02:19:01,010 --> 02:19:03,470
Just not that much compared to everybody else.

3138
02:19:07,370 --> 02:19:08,970
I'm just a little baby.

3139
02:19:09,170 --> 02:19:11,370
Wait, what is the rank number right now?

3140
02:19:11,890 --> 02:19:14,250
Oh shit, he is ranked 4?!

3141
02:19:14,250 --> 02:19:15,610
Oh my god!

3142
02:19:15,710 --> 02:19:17,290
Wait, I'm playing with the ranked guys.

3143
02:19:17,470 --> 02:19:18,770
New clickbait title.

3144
02:19:19,130 --> 02:19:21,390
Playing with the ranked 4 player.

3145
02:19:21,630 --> 02:19:22,850
With top 5 player.

3146
02:19:23,310 --> 02:19:29,610
Playing with the top 5 player right now.

3147
02:19:29,690 --> 02:19:30,710
That's my clickbait title.

3148
02:19:31,370 --> 02:19:33,070
Let's go, clickbait.

3149
02:19:33,510 --> 02:19:33,510
Yeah!

3150
02:19:33,510 --> 02:19:33,610
Yeah!

3151
02:19:39,010 --> 02:19:40,810
Bottle, thank you for the 100 bitties.

3152
02:19:40,870 --> 02:19:41,950
Thank you, thank you.

3153
02:19:42,070 --> 02:19:45,170
I want to credit Ashley and you on your sportsmanship at the Twitch Rivals MR.

3154
02:19:45,330 --> 02:19:45,610
You were great.

3155
02:19:45,690 --> 02:19:47,450
Despite everything you went through, you managed to win.

3156
02:19:47,530 --> 02:19:48,530
My compliments again.

3157
02:19:48,690 --> 02:19:50,370
Have a great stream.

3158
02:19:50,650 --> 02:19:51,310
I have to go to work.

3159
02:19:51,390 --> 02:19:51,970
Thank you!

3160
02:19:52,010 --> 02:19:52,970
Thank you for the bitties.

3161
02:19:53,110 --> 02:19:53,910
Thank you, thank you.

3162
02:19:53,970 --> 02:19:55,330
No, that's not my friends list.

3163
02:19:55,450 --> 02:19:56,170
No, look here.

3164
02:19:57,150 --> 02:19:59,210
Oh wait, that is my friends list.

3165
02:20:00,090 --> 02:20:00,590
JK.

3166
02:20:01,290 --> 02:20:02,230
Oh my god.

3167
02:20:02,290 --> 02:20:03,470
Sorry, I'm dumb.

3168
02:20:03,930 --> 02:20:04,630
Alright, what is he?

3169
02:20:05,110 --> 02:20:05,990
I'll never know.

3170
02:20:06,230 --> 02:20:07,210
Top 30 guys.

3171
02:20:11,490 --> 02:20:13,170
Wait, is that 600?

3172
02:20:13,350 --> 02:20:14,350
That's like crazy.

3173
02:20:15,170 --> 02:20:17,630
Are we playing with the same people and against the same people?

3174
02:20:18,190 --> 02:20:20,210
We have to be because...

3175
02:20:21,910 --> 02:20:25,350
I would not be surprised if we're playing with and against the same people.

3176
02:20:26,450 --> 02:20:27,610
I can't fish myself.

3177
02:20:27,610 --> 02:20:31,130
I think I'm playing against the Sinatraa 3-stack.

3178
02:20:31,350 --> 02:20:32,830
Because we're 3-stacking now too.

3179
02:20:33,470 --> 02:20:38,110
So it makes sense that we're playing against the same 3-stack.

3180
02:20:39,070 --> 02:20:40,490
Unless they finished?

3181
02:20:40,770 --> 02:20:41,230
I don't know.

3182
02:20:44,010 --> 02:20:45,450
Maybe they stopped playing.

3183
02:20:46,650 --> 02:20:48,670
I gaslighted myself into clickbaiting.

3184
02:20:50,130 --> 02:20:50,770
Wolverine?

3185
02:20:51,450 --> 02:20:51,850
Okay.

3186
02:20:52,770 --> 02:20:53,210
Ah!

3187
02:20:53,210 --> 02:20:57,050
No, trio tank.

3188
02:20:57,350 --> 02:20:57,790
Triple tank.

3189
02:20:57,890 --> 02:21:00,030
Oh shit!

3190
02:21:00,350 --> 02:21:01,050
Triple tank!

3191
02:21:03,250 --> 02:21:03,970
Okay.

3192
02:21:04,430 --> 02:21:05,330
I play Bucky.

3193
02:21:05,990 --> 02:21:07,450
Ben... Adam?

3194
02:21:08,150 --> 02:21:08,630
Oh yeah.

3195
02:21:10,110 --> 02:21:10,830
Okay.

3196
02:21:12,190 --> 02:21:13,330
Triple tank time.

3197
02:21:14,730 --> 02:21:16,210
Yo, check me out this mag.

3198
02:21:16,250 --> 02:21:16,830
This mag.

3199
02:21:22,470 --> 02:21:23,190
What?!

3200
02:21:24,080 --> 02:21:24,550
It's triple.

3201
02:21:26,330 --> 02:21:27,010
Wait, what?

3202
02:21:30,190 --> 02:21:31,870
We got two Japanese.

3203
02:21:32,390 --> 02:21:32,990
Never lose.

3204
02:21:33,630 --> 02:21:34,650
Oh my god.

3205
02:21:37,850 --> 02:21:38,550
Chopper.

3206
02:21:39,850 --> 02:21:40,550
Chopper.

3207
02:21:41,790 --> 02:21:43,490
Wait, go Mantis?

3208
02:21:44,210 --> 02:21:45,530
We can do one tap.

3209
02:21:45,970 --> 02:21:48,110
I mean like, we can play 3 tanks, right?

3210
02:21:48,110 --> 02:21:49,010
Oh my god.

3211
02:21:55,990 --> 02:22:00,910
Yeah, yellow hair, yellow hair.

3212
02:22:09,770 --> 02:22:12,110
Chopper, triple tank, chopper.

3213
02:22:13,950 --> 02:22:15,670
Alright, what?

3214
02:22:16,130 --> 02:22:17,470
Triple tank, 3 tank, 3 tank.

3215
02:22:18,990 --> 02:22:20,190
Who is a chopper?

3216
02:22:20,470 --> 02:22:20,930
A Venom?

3217
02:22:22,290 --> 02:22:23,250
Fuck you!

3218
02:22:23,830 --> 02:22:25,510
Triple tank, triple tank, triple tank.

3219
02:22:27,230 --> 02:22:28,290
What should I do?

3220
02:22:29,030 --> 02:22:30,490
Tank, tank.

3221
02:22:30,570 --> 02:22:32,510
Take me, take me, take me, take me.

3222
02:22:33,450 --> 02:22:34,250
Let's go.

3223
02:22:34,930 --> 02:22:35,250
Okay.

3224
02:22:39,730 --> 02:22:41,290
You are Venom and he's a chopper?

3225
02:22:42,590 --> 02:22:42,950
Hair.

3226
02:22:43,370 --> 02:22:43,830
Shut up.

3227
02:22:45,350 --> 02:22:47,290
Oh my god, chopper.

3228
02:22:49,750 --> 02:22:50,590
Okay, do we have lucky?

3229
02:22:50,910 --> 02:22:51,830
Okay, lucky mag.

3230
02:22:51,930 --> 02:22:52,290
Guys.

3231
02:22:54,210 --> 02:22:55,550
Hello, lucky hello.

3232
02:22:55,830 --> 02:22:56,950
I gave you ammo, I gave you ammo.

3233
02:22:59,610 --> 02:23:00,170
I have bubble, I have bubble.

3234
02:23:01,530 --> 02:23:02,510
Go push, go push.

3235
02:23:04,650 --> 02:23:05,610
Van line low, van line low.

3236
02:23:06,210 --> 02:23:06,770
Wait, Sylas one.

3237
02:23:06,910 --> 02:23:07,630
Sylas low, Sylas low.

3238
02:23:08,150 --> 02:23:08,570
Oh, Venom.

3239
02:23:09,230 --> 02:23:10,550
I'll keep my gun, I'll keep my gun.

3240
02:23:10,550 --> 02:23:13,330
Yo, chopper, something good, what the fuck are you doing?

3241
02:23:13,830 --> 02:23:16,990
I have bubble, I have bubble, I have bubble.

3242
02:23:23,750 --> 02:23:25,510
What's going on?

3243
02:23:26,130 --> 02:23:30,970
Mag, mag, mag, mag, mag.

3244
02:23:34,310 --> 02:23:35,690
Oh my god.

3245
02:23:37,050 --> 02:23:38,510
What's going on?

3246
02:23:38,510 --> 02:23:40,790
Hey, right side, suit, suit, suit, suit, suit.

3247
02:23:40,910 --> 02:23:42,620
What the fuck is going on?

3248
02:23:43,430 --> 02:23:44,750
I killed body, body.

3249
02:23:48,750 --> 02:23:50,590
Yo, chopper, something good, oh.

3250
02:23:54,050 --> 02:23:54,730
Bubble you, bubble you.

3251
02:23:55,330 --> 02:23:56,950
Oh, Sylas got me, Sylas got me.

3252
02:23:57,670 --> 02:23:58,230
I'm put.

3253
02:23:58,890 --> 02:23:59,810
Sylas, Sylas, Sylas.

3254
02:23:59,890 --> 02:24:00,610
Behind someone, behind someone.

3255
02:24:03,650 --> 02:24:04,210
Sylas one.

3256
02:24:05,750 --> 02:24:06,630
I got him, yeah.

3257
02:24:08,510 --> 02:24:10,030
Are you okay?

3258
02:24:10,390 --> 02:24:12,150
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay, I'm okay.

3259
02:24:14,350 --> 02:24:16,390
Are you okay?

3260
02:24:22,090 --> 02:24:23,930
Oh my god, he's so polite.

3261
02:24:24,090 --> 02:24:31,080
What the fuck?

3262
02:24:32,660 --> 02:24:34,040
Oh, shield.

3263
02:24:34,800 --> 02:24:35,860
Shield, no!

3264
02:24:36,780 --> 02:24:37,780
Where's shield?

3265
02:24:39,800 --> 02:24:40,900
Chopper, where's shield?

3266
02:24:43,340 --> 02:24:46,540
One, one, one, one.

3267
02:24:46,940 --> 02:24:49,800
Okay, okay.

3268
02:24:50,380 --> 02:24:50,960
Hello, chopper.

3269
02:24:52,840 --> 02:24:53,640
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

3270
02:24:53,680 --> 02:24:54,360
I'm fucked up.

3271
02:24:55,760 --> 02:24:56,580
I can damage you.

3272
02:24:57,420 --> 02:24:58,720
I'm back, I'm back, I'm back.

3273
02:25:02,860 --> 02:25:04,360
We can Luna, Luna.

3274
02:25:04,520 --> 02:25:05,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3275
02:25:08,940 --> 02:25:10,500
Oh, Hala main, Hala main.

3276
02:25:11,720 --> 02:25:12,200
Okay.

3277
02:25:18,260 --> 02:25:19,680
There's a Sylas on point.

3278
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:22,080
Sylas behind guys.

3279
02:25:23,520 --> 02:25:23,760
Okay.

3280
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:24,500
I'm pushing main.

3281
02:25:24,560 --> 02:25:26,280
Three, two, one.

3282
02:25:27,360 --> 02:25:28,180
Hala, Hala, Hala.

3283
02:25:28,620 --> 02:25:31,520
Oh my god.

3284
02:25:31,960 --> 02:25:33,440
Hala, Hala, Hala.

3285
02:25:34,420 --> 02:25:35,100
Mag on me.

3286
02:25:35,100 --> 02:25:38,500
Go up, go up.

3287
02:25:38,800 --> 02:25:40,680
Mag one, mag one.

3288
02:25:42,680 --> 02:25:43,360
No!

3289
02:25:44,620 --> 02:25:45,380
There's a Sylas.

3290
02:25:45,380 --> 02:25:45,940
Oh, I'm alive.

3291
02:25:46,120 --> 02:25:46,740
Yippee!

3292
02:25:48,220 --> 02:25:49,700
Sylas one, Sylas one.

3293
02:25:54,100 --> 02:25:55,200
Let's go guys.

3294
02:26:00,140 --> 02:26:05,080
Okay, everything is okay guys.

3295
02:26:05,100 --> 02:26:08,300
Everything is as okay as it can be.

3296
02:26:08,840 --> 02:26:10,900
Before it starts not being okay.

3297
02:26:11,420 --> 02:26:13,960
It's as okay as it can be until it's not okay.

3298
02:26:17,080 --> 02:26:17,740
Okay.

3299
02:26:22,910 --> 02:26:24,150
Jesus Christ.

3300
02:26:26,450 --> 02:26:27,690
Oh my god.

3301
02:26:28,710 --> 02:26:31,530
Everything is okay until it's not okay.

3302
02:26:33,350 --> 02:26:33,930
Okay.

3303
02:26:34,930 --> 02:26:36,650
Focus Hala.

3304
02:26:40,550 --> 02:26:41,950
I can't!

3305
02:26:43,590 --> 02:26:43,830
No!

3306
02:26:44,550 --> 02:26:45,570
I can't!

3307
02:26:48,430 --> 02:26:50,350
You're down too.

3308
02:26:59,510 --> 02:27:02,630
I'm five percent.

3309
02:27:05,490 --> 02:27:06,430
Can I blow up?

3310
02:27:10,250 --> 02:27:11,250
Yeah, yeah.

3311
02:27:21,170 --> 02:27:22,470
Okay, I'm damaged.

3312
02:27:27,710 --> 02:27:28,710
Oh, Rocket's dead.

3313
02:27:31,370 --> 02:27:32,610
Rocket's dead, I get it.

3314
02:27:33,930 --> 02:27:36,090
Come back, come back, come back.

3315
02:27:36,750 --> 02:27:37,670
Oh,

3316
02:27:42,590 --> 02:27:42,850
goodbye.

3317
02:27:44,830 --> 02:27:49,090
I was like, well, at least Rocket's dead.

3318
02:27:52,510 --> 02:27:54,350
I believe.

3319
02:27:58,750 --> 02:27:59,410
Let's go.

3320
02:27:59,670 --> 02:28:02,070
I believe.

3321
02:28:05,070 --> 02:28:06,930
Wait, four take?!

3322
02:28:13,930 --> 02:28:16,090
I can't get through portal.

3323
02:28:17,950 --> 02:28:18,730
No!

3324
02:28:19,530 --> 02:28:20,410
The portal!

3325
02:28:21,390 --> 02:28:23,350
I couldn't get through portal!

3326
02:28:24,490 --> 02:28:24,750
No!

3327
02:28:25,950 --> 02:28:27,350
No heals, yeah.

3328
02:28:30,780 --> 02:28:32,730
No more Rocket, no more Rocket, please.

3329
02:28:34,490 --> 02:28:35,130
What's up?

3330
02:28:35,550 --> 02:28:36,130
He swapped.

3331
02:28:36,290 --> 02:28:37,390
I'm on D, Hala.

3332
02:28:38,670 --> 02:28:39,530
Yeah, I've been off.

3333
02:28:40,250 --> 02:28:40,730
Okay.

3334
02:28:44,550 --> 02:28:46,610
One, next, five, take.

3335
02:28:46,990 --> 02:28:48,890
Guys, I can solo this.

3336
02:28:55,200 --> 02:28:56,020
That's fine.

3337
02:28:56,360 --> 02:28:57,560
We can go, we can go.

3338
02:28:58,380 --> 02:28:58,860
We'll come down.

3339
02:28:59,260 --> 02:29:00,760
I hear Psylocke behind us.

3340
02:29:01,320 --> 02:29:02,620
No, no, no, we'll come down.

3341
02:29:04,320 --> 02:29:04,800
Yep.

3342
02:29:05,040 --> 02:29:05,440
Psylocke behind.

3343
02:29:05,440 --> 02:29:06,260
Yeah.

3344
02:29:09,500 --> 02:29:10,540
Oh my god.

3345
02:29:10,820 --> 02:29:12,320
Go push, guys, I'm on it.

3346
02:29:13,840 --> 02:29:14,380
No!

3347
02:29:15,620 --> 02:29:17,340
Oh, he double super ulted.

3348
02:29:18,720 --> 02:29:20,460
I'm damage boosting, I'm damage boosting.

3349
02:29:23,200 --> 02:29:24,300
You're damage boosting!

3350
02:29:26,500 --> 02:29:27,940
Rocket one, Rocket's one!

3351
02:29:31,400 --> 02:29:31,940
Nice.

3352
02:29:33,640 --> 02:29:34,760
Okay, nice, nice.

3353
02:29:34,760 --> 02:29:35,580
That's fine.

3354
02:29:35,680 --> 02:29:37,160
We stacked, but it's okay.

3355
02:29:40,140 --> 02:29:41,000
It's okay.

3356
02:29:43,980 --> 02:29:45,660
We stacked, but it's okay.

3357
02:29:46,240 --> 02:29:47,560
We still made it.

3358
02:29:48,660 --> 02:29:50,540
Things still worked out.

3359
02:29:57,270 --> 02:29:58,810
Oh my god.

3360
02:29:59,650 --> 02:30:00,210
Lynn!

3361
02:30:00,510 --> 02:30:02,230
Lynn, thank you for the raid!

3362
02:30:02,350 --> 02:30:04,350
Thank you, thank you, I really appreciate it.

3363
02:30:04,350 --> 02:30:06,050
Also, Flynn, thank you for the Twitch bombs.

3364
02:30:06,190 --> 02:30:07,110
Thank you, thank you.

3365
02:30:07,530 --> 02:30:09,350
Alright, what did he say, guys?

3366
02:30:09,590 --> 02:30:10,250
What did he say?

3367
02:30:10,310 --> 02:30:11,010
Is it appropriate?

3368
02:30:15,110 --> 02:30:16,430
What did he say?

3369
02:30:16,550 --> 02:30:17,410
Is it appropriate?

3370
02:30:17,810 --> 02:30:18,350
I just know...

3371
02:30:31,970 --> 02:30:33,310
What did you say?

3372
02:30:34,910 --> 02:30:36,510
No, I am going my phone.

3373
02:30:38,950 --> 02:30:39,590
Okay.

3374
02:30:43,990 --> 02:30:46,390
You're having a normal conversation.

3375
02:30:46,830 --> 02:30:48,670
I only think to read this.

3376
02:30:50,490 --> 02:30:53,190
I don't trust Chopper anymore.

3377
02:30:53,510 --> 02:30:55,410
I don't trust him.

3378
02:30:57,050 --> 02:30:58,250
I'm reading it.

3379
02:30:58,330 --> 02:30:59,530
You guys are saying...

3380
02:30:59,530 --> 02:31:00,070
You guys are confused.

3381
02:31:02,410 --> 02:31:03,190
What?

3382
02:31:03,860 --> 02:31:05,850
Wait, you lied on the internet?

3383
02:31:09,990 --> 02:31:11,550
Change topic?

3384
02:31:12,030 --> 02:31:12,530
I don't know.

3385
02:31:13,760 --> 02:31:15,070
What do I do?

3386
02:31:15,290 --> 02:31:16,410
I don't know.

3387
02:31:18,800 --> 02:31:20,290
What do we do?

3388
02:31:26,270 --> 02:31:29,110
What do you mean you don't know?

3389
02:31:30,070 --> 02:31:32,210
I don't know.

3390
02:31:32,210 --> 02:31:35,490
I'm going left.

3391
02:31:37,610 --> 02:31:43,030
What is this?

3392
02:31:54,190 --> 02:31:55,590
I'm dead.

3393
02:32:01,750 --> 02:32:03,120
Too many things.

3394
02:32:13,400 --> 02:32:15,260
Oh my god.

3395
02:32:22,460 --> 02:32:23,780
I'm scared.

3396
02:32:24,280 --> 02:32:24,460
Why?

3397
02:32:24,720 --> 02:32:26,980
Why did you bring him closer to us?

3398
02:32:29,660 --> 02:32:30,320
Please.

3399
02:32:30,580 --> 02:32:33,160
I can't keep us up any longer.

3400
02:32:35,880 --> 02:32:37,460
Oh my god.

3401
02:32:37,560 --> 02:32:38,540
Why did you...

3402
02:32:38,540 --> 02:32:39,800
Oh my god.

3403
02:32:41,670 --> 02:32:42,840
That is unfortunate.

3404
02:32:45,020 --> 02:32:47,340
I don't know how to live.

3405
02:32:48,880 --> 02:32:49,520
That is...

3406
02:32:49,520 --> 02:32:51,040
That is unfortunate.

3407
02:32:51,800 --> 02:32:54,020
I go first?

3408
02:32:54,140 --> 02:32:54,220
Okay.

3409
02:32:57,060 --> 02:32:57,420
Okay.

3410
02:33:02,040 --> 02:33:03,400
We got this.

3411
02:33:04,480 --> 02:33:07,200
He jumped into the mega.

3412
02:33:07,380 --> 02:33:08,400
That was crazy.

3413
02:33:10,040 --> 02:33:11,300
He was...

3414
02:33:11,300 --> 02:33:12,400
He was fucking wild.

3415
02:33:15,300 --> 02:33:16,360
Fucking wild.

3416
02:33:20,140 --> 02:33:21,880
Oh my god.

3417
02:33:22,680 --> 02:33:24,080
Oh my god.

3418
02:33:29,060 --> 02:33:30,520
I can't go any...

3419
02:33:30,520 --> 02:33:31,020
Oh, hello.

3420
02:33:31,020 --> 02:33:31,260
Hello.

3421
02:33:32,740 --> 02:33:33,340
Hello.

3422
02:33:34,420 --> 02:33:35,200
I'm coming back.

3423
02:33:38,800 --> 02:33:39,400
Please.

3424
02:33:42,700 --> 02:33:44,020
Someone get the Hella, please.

3425
02:33:44,360 --> 02:33:44,900
In the sky.

3426
02:33:44,980 --> 02:33:45,140
No.

3427
02:33:47,260 --> 02:33:50,280
The Hella just shot us for free.

3428
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,100
Oh, did he shoot us for free?

3429
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:03,380
Okay, I'm here now.

3430
02:34:10,660 --> 02:34:11,600
It's okay.

3431
02:34:15,460 --> 02:34:16,040
Okay.

3432
02:34:19,920 --> 02:34:20,480
Let me try.

3433
02:34:24,840 --> 02:34:26,640
Jesus Christ, we can't see the tanks.

3434
02:34:31,720 --> 02:34:34,980
We're getting pushed back so hard.

3435
02:34:37,640 --> 02:34:38,780
Is it winnable?

3436
02:34:39,480 --> 02:34:40,280
No.

3437
02:34:41,080 --> 02:34:42,340
Not winnable.

3438
02:34:42,900 --> 02:34:44,780
Not winnable.

3439
02:34:45,400 --> 02:34:47,560
I'm getting harassed so hard.

3440
02:34:51,710 --> 02:34:53,850
I'm getting harassed right now.

3441
02:34:55,030 --> 02:34:57,570
Why am I always getting harassed?

3442
02:34:58,670 --> 02:34:59,890
They use megas.

3443
02:35:00,550 --> 02:35:04,130
How do I position myself when there's...

3444
02:35:04,130 --> 02:35:05,690
When this fucker keeps trying...

3445
02:35:06,170 --> 02:35:06,930
It's not fair.

3446
02:35:07,010 --> 02:35:08,670
She can just go invisible.

3447
02:35:15,070 --> 02:35:17,610
She can just go invisible.

3448
02:35:18,670 --> 02:35:20,530
What can I do about that?

3449
02:35:22,310 --> 02:35:22,670
Heal tank.

3450
02:35:22,830 --> 02:35:22,970
Heal tank.

3451
02:35:23,590 --> 02:35:24,010
Mega one.

3452
02:35:25,010 --> 02:35:25,630
Mega is really one.

3453
02:35:26,330 --> 02:35:27,210
Oh, really?

3454
02:35:28,470 --> 02:35:29,570
He's really one.

3455
02:35:38,670 --> 02:35:40,590
That's when you know he's really one.

3456
02:35:46,730 --> 02:35:47,550
I go first.

3457
02:35:47,630 --> 02:35:47,930
I go first.

3458
02:35:48,530 --> 02:35:51,370
Oh, it's okay.

3459
02:35:51,610 --> 02:35:51,990
Nice.

3460
02:35:55,750 --> 02:35:56,790
Oh, no.

3461
02:35:57,810 --> 02:35:59,730
He said me first.

3462
02:36:00,850 --> 02:36:03,010
I fucking... I went me first.

3463
02:36:03,870 --> 02:36:05,250
It's okay, he died.

3464
02:36:08,770 --> 02:36:10,410
Look, it's not my fault.

3465
02:36:10,870 --> 02:36:12,850
Porky literally said I ult first.

3466
02:36:13,050 --> 02:36:13,910
And I...

3467
02:36:13,910 --> 02:36:15,730
And I went first.

3468
02:36:19,670 --> 02:36:20,350
Alright.

3469
02:36:27,810 --> 02:36:28,330
Okay.

3470
02:36:29,410 --> 02:36:31,310
I have a little bit of the heals on me.

3471
02:36:35,810 --> 02:36:37,490
Oh my god, I accidentally...

3472
02:36:37,490 --> 02:36:40,450
I accidentally hit my right click mouse.

3473
02:36:44,590 --> 02:36:46,650
I accidentally hit my right click for that.

3474
02:36:51,590 --> 02:36:52,110
Nice.

3475
02:36:53,990 --> 02:36:55,990
I got you!

3476
02:36:56,010 --> 02:36:56,330
I got you!

3477
02:36:56,350 --> 02:36:56,770
I got you!

3478
02:36:57,730 --> 02:36:58,310
Heal soon.

3479
02:36:58,430 --> 02:36:58,650
Heal soon.

3480
02:36:58,730 --> 02:36:59,030
Heal soon.

3481
02:36:59,210 --> 02:36:59,510
Come back.

3482
02:36:59,630 --> 02:36:59,770
Come back.

3483
02:37:00,070 --> 02:37:00,750
Mag's on point.

3484
02:37:00,830 --> 02:37:01,270
Mag's in front.

3485
02:37:01,370 --> 02:37:01,710
Mag's one.

3486
02:37:01,790 --> 02:37:02,270
Mag's one.

3487
02:37:03,310 --> 02:37:03,710
No!

3488
02:37:07,330 --> 02:37:08,830
I was one.

3489
02:37:10,130 --> 02:37:11,770
He's still one.

3490
02:37:11,810 --> 02:37:12,190
No support.

3491
02:37:12,350 --> 02:37:12,810
No support.

3492
02:37:13,590 --> 02:37:14,370
Can I touch?

3493
02:37:14,410 --> 02:37:14,730
Can I touch?

3494
02:37:16,790 --> 02:37:18,110
He fucked up portal.

3495
02:37:23,170 --> 02:37:25,450
Why did no one shoot the mag?

3496
02:37:28,810 --> 02:37:29,610
What?

3497
02:37:33,570 --> 02:37:35,010
Oh my god.

3498
02:37:35,750 --> 02:37:37,990
It's really rough because it's like...

3499
02:37:38,750 --> 02:37:39,750
What do we do?

3500
02:37:41,870 --> 02:37:44,430
I think three tank bad.

3501
02:37:54,510 --> 02:37:57,190
Yeah, this Psylocke is very annoying.

3502
02:37:58,390 --> 02:38:01,670
Wise words.

3503
02:38:04,410 --> 02:38:05,870
So wise.

3504
02:38:07,290 --> 02:38:08,150
Okay.

3505
02:38:16,120 --> 02:38:17,680
Things will be fine.

3506
02:38:19,110 --> 02:38:20,420
Things will be okay.

3507
02:38:22,030 --> 02:38:23,800
And Nemo was open, yeah?

3508
02:38:27,400 --> 02:38:27,920
Yeah.

3509
02:38:27,920 --> 02:38:29,580
Oh my god.

3510
02:38:29,620 --> 02:38:31,300
No, that Psylocke is doing so much.

3511
02:38:31,860 --> 02:38:33,800
He's doing so much and like...

3512
02:38:34,960 --> 02:38:36,640
And like, it's fucking me over.

3513
02:38:39,120 --> 02:38:40,260
Okay, I have my armor.

3514
02:38:43,560 --> 02:38:44,080
Ooh.

3515
02:38:44,660 --> 02:38:45,660
Team up time.

3516
02:38:46,720 --> 02:38:48,020
We're trying trying.

3517
02:38:50,980 --> 02:38:52,060
Yup, I have knife.

3518
02:38:53,420 --> 02:38:54,780
We're trying trying.

3519
02:38:55,120 --> 02:38:56,480
Oh my god, he missed.

3520
02:38:56,680 --> 02:38:57,500
Okay, I was gonna say.

3521
02:38:59,160 --> 02:39:02,020
If he missed that knife, I was gonna be...

3522
02:39:02,020 --> 02:39:03,640
I was gonna be a little sad.

3523
02:39:13,620 --> 02:39:14,120
Okay.

3524
02:39:15,340 --> 02:39:16,500
Oh my god.

3525
02:39:19,300 --> 02:39:20,800
They're doing so much damage.

3526
02:39:22,060 --> 02:39:22,940
I'm flaming him.

3527
02:39:27,660 --> 02:39:28,360
Hey.

3528
02:39:34,830 --> 02:39:37,780
I'm clapping, I'm clapping, I'm clapping, I'm clapping.

3529
02:39:38,750 --> 02:39:40,420
I'm clapping, I'm clapping.

3530
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:43,760
I'm clapping, I'm clapping.

3531
02:39:44,200 --> 02:39:45,020
Yes, yes, yes.

3532
02:39:47,750 --> 02:39:48,920
Oh my god.

3533
02:40:06,280 --> 02:40:08,460
I don't have enough!

3534
02:40:09,020 --> 02:40:10,760
I was so close!

3535
02:40:14,400 --> 02:40:16,840
I was 5%!

3536
02:40:20,120 --> 02:40:20,820
NOOOOOO!

3537
02:40:20,900 --> 02:40:22,140
Let's see who we can draw, maybe.

3538
02:40:26,320 --> 02:40:26,920
Drawable.

3539
02:40:27,060 --> 02:40:28,140
It's so drawable.

3540
02:40:31,820 --> 02:40:34,280
We couldn't build ult fast enough.

3541
02:40:40,470 --> 02:40:43,550
We couldn't get ult charge fast enough there.

3542
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:49,860
It's so drawable.

3543
02:40:49,920 --> 02:40:50,840
You're so right, guys.

3544
02:40:51,120 --> 02:40:52,000
It's so drawable.

3545
02:40:53,000 --> 02:41:00,680
It's just pretty bad right now because we don't have another DPS player.

3546
02:41:03,780 --> 02:41:05,180
They do.

3547
02:41:05,920 --> 02:41:07,900
We have three tank players.

3548
02:41:17,340 --> 02:41:18,350
I'm scared.

3549
02:41:18,810 --> 02:41:20,670
I'm so scared.

3550
02:41:21,410 --> 02:41:23,650
He's gonna fucking kill me.

3551
02:41:27,770 --> 02:41:29,090
Oh my god.

3552
02:41:29,190 --> 02:41:33,210
I think even if we healed each other as supports, we'd still die to it.

3553
02:41:33,330 --> 02:41:34,510
Unless we all stacked to it.

3554
02:41:34,530 --> 02:41:35,910
We didn't all stack to it.

3555
02:41:38,930 --> 02:41:40,470
We weren't stacking together.

3556
02:41:40,750 --> 02:41:41,950
That's the only way to heal it.

3557
02:41:41,990 --> 02:41:43,390
I think I trust my supports more.

3558
02:41:45,110 --> 02:41:47,670
I trust my supports to all be together.

3559
02:41:51,070 --> 02:41:52,170
The guardians of the galaxy...

3560
02:41:52,170 --> 02:41:52,430
What?

3561
02:41:53,950 --> 02:41:54,510
Oh, oh.

3562
02:41:56,430 --> 02:41:57,410
Maybe TP, TP, TP.

3563
02:41:57,430 --> 02:41:58,130
They're gonna TP, guys.

3564
02:41:58,390 --> 02:42:00,250
TP, TP, TP behind, guys.

3565
02:42:01,350 --> 02:42:02,150
Slow, slow, slow, slow.

3566
02:42:02,170 --> 02:42:02,510
I'm scared.

3567
02:42:05,870 --> 02:42:06,750
I can't choke here.

3568
02:42:07,150 --> 02:42:07,570
Slow, slow, slow.

3569
02:42:07,610 --> 02:42:07,890
We have D.Va.

3570
02:42:08,190 --> 02:42:09,190
Let them push, let them push a little bit.

3571
02:42:10,190 --> 02:42:10,630
Rotate, rotate.

3572
02:42:13,290 --> 02:42:14,210
I've res, I've res, I've res.

3573
02:42:14,270 --> 02:42:15,110
I can't touch point, guys.

3574
02:42:16,650 --> 02:42:17,150
Strange low.

3575
02:42:18,630 --> 02:42:19,750
Strange, strange, strange, strange.

3576
02:42:19,890 --> 02:42:21,230
Strange on a Raccoon.

3577
02:42:22,010 --> 02:42:22,870
Okay, it's okay.

3578
02:42:23,090 --> 02:42:23,390
I'm scared.

3579
02:42:23,810 --> 02:42:24,130
Strange one.

3580
02:42:28,970 --> 02:42:30,670
I have strange on me.

3581
02:42:31,030 --> 02:42:31,750
Strange frozen.

3582
02:42:37,260 --> 02:42:37,920
Strange one.

3583
02:42:40,100 --> 02:42:41,280
Strange, back on me.

3584
02:42:41,880 --> 02:42:42,580
I have to heal.

3585
02:42:42,780 --> 02:42:43,240
Ouch, point.

3586
02:42:43,240 --> 02:42:44,020
No!

3587
02:42:47,920 --> 02:42:48,340
No!

3588
02:42:50,100 --> 02:42:52,480
They just walked up.

3589
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:56,240
That's all they do.

3590
02:42:57,220 --> 02:42:58,980
They just walked up.

3591
02:43:01,400 --> 02:43:02,820
Oh my god.

3592
02:43:05,080 --> 02:43:07,100
They're just doing whatever they want.

3593
02:43:08,940 --> 02:43:10,600
How do you win?

3594
02:43:10,720 --> 02:43:11,800
That's a very good question.

3595
02:43:11,800 --> 02:43:15,660
They just walked up slowly to me and just started hitting me.

3596
02:43:15,760 --> 02:43:17,760
Like, what do I do?

3597
02:43:19,020 --> 02:43:21,360
What do I do?

3598
02:43:22,220 --> 02:43:26,420
When they just walked up to me and just bashed my head.

3599
02:43:27,300 --> 02:43:29,780
Like, no one to challenge them.

3600
02:43:30,280 --> 02:43:30,720
Yeah.

3601
02:43:32,800 --> 02:43:33,100
Unfortunately.

3602
02:43:34,200 --> 02:43:35,220
It's just very unfortunate.

3603
02:43:35,960 --> 02:43:37,860
Yeah, we just ended up, you know, damaged.

3604
02:43:38,200 --> 02:43:39,620
We literally just walked down.

3605
02:43:39,900 --> 02:43:40,560
I did.

3606
02:43:41,800 --> 02:43:44,740
I ran away and they just kept walking up to me.

3607
02:43:44,840 --> 02:43:46,800
I couldn't run away too far because I had to heal my tank.

3608
02:43:46,940 --> 02:43:48,840
But like, I was actually crazy.

3609
02:43:49,960 --> 02:43:50,820
I just...

3610
02:43:50,820 --> 02:43:52,500
There was no way to go.

3611
02:43:53,400 --> 02:43:54,800
There was...

3612
02:44:00,410 --> 02:44:04,030
Well, I can't believe Gomez is a silver one player.

3613
02:44:04,770 --> 02:44:05,250
Damn.

3614
02:44:05,630 --> 02:44:07,190
I can't believe.

3615
02:44:08,090 --> 02:44:08,950
I can't...

3616
02:44:08,950 --> 02:44:11,530
Damn, he's really fell off, guys.

3617
02:44:13,870 --> 02:44:16,430
MRI really fucked him up, guys.

3618
02:44:16,990 --> 02:44:19,370
He's an actual silver player.

3619
02:44:19,870 --> 02:44:20,450
Damn.

3620
02:44:22,230 --> 02:44:23,090
I'm sending that.

3621
02:44:27,970 --> 02:44:30,070
Looks legit to me.

3622
02:44:30,650 --> 02:44:31,650
Oh my god.

3623
02:44:33,610 --> 02:44:34,290
That's...

3624
02:44:34,290 --> 02:44:35,570
That's sad, guys.

3625
02:44:36,030 --> 02:44:37,490
I can't believe it.

3626
02:44:38,410 --> 02:44:40,430
What do you mean I blame Meat Doki?

3627
02:44:40,670 --> 02:44:41,510
What the fuck did I do?

3628
02:44:41,510 --> 02:44:42,370
I do!

3629
02:44:42,870 --> 02:44:44,910
I can't believe Sen...

3630
02:44:45,510 --> 02:44:49,870
Gomez from Sentinels is a silver one player.

3631
02:45:03,130 --> 02:45:05,550
Oh my god.

3632
02:45:08,340 --> 02:45:10,750
Guys, Identity Theft is a little funny though.

3633
02:45:10,750 --> 02:45:11,490
It is.

3634
02:45:11,710 --> 02:45:12,310
Oh my god!

3635
02:45:12,430 --> 02:45:13,370
You lose...

3636
02:45:13,370 --> 02:45:15,950
Gomez lost in silver?!

3637
02:45:15,950 --> 02:45:17,650
Oh my god!

3638
02:45:17,730 --> 02:45:19,730
Number one Furmes fan.

3639
02:45:19,850 --> 02:45:20,030
Okay.

3640
02:45:22,050 --> 02:45:22,730
Wow.

3641
02:45:23,350 --> 02:45:25,050
I can't believe it.

3642
02:45:26,150 --> 02:45:27,670
He deranked a lot.

3643
02:45:29,510 --> 02:45:30,030
What?

3644
02:45:30,150 --> 02:45:31,150
Getting third in MR...

3645
02:45:31,150 --> 02:45:31,830
Oh my god.

3646
02:45:31,890 --> 02:45:32,090
Get...

3647
02:45:32,090 --> 02:45:33,130
I can't believe it.

3648
02:45:33,430 --> 02:45:39,110
He got third in MRI and then now he deranked all the way to silver.

3649
02:45:39,290 --> 02:45:40,030
That's sad.

3650
02:45:40,750 --> 02:45:41,790
Wasn't my fault though.

3651
02:45:42,350 --> 02:45:44,970
I was streaming other stuff during MRI.

3652
02:45:48,520 --> 02:45:49,780
Can't blame me.

3653
02:45:53,180 --> 02:45:54,560
Alright, who are we playing against?

3654
02:45:54,560 --> 02:45:56,080
I think we're playing against the same people.

3655
02:45:58,020 --> 02:46:00,600
That Doomcube was fucking crazy.

3656
02:46:01,020 --> 02:46:01,300
Yeah.

3657
02:46:01,920 --> 02:46:06,800
How many games do you have to lose to even go from eternity to like silver?

3658
02:46:11,320 --> 02:46:13,120
All the mighty have fallen.

3659
02:46:14,760 --> 02:46:16,420
Truly a sad time.

3660
02:46:17,560 --> 02:46:18,160
Okay.

3661
02:46:18,760 --> 02:46:20,880
But we have the same Venom player, I'm pretty sure.

3662
02:46:21,480 --> 02:46:22,120
I'm banning Groot.

3663
02:46:22,480 --> 02:46:23,760
I don't want to deal with Groot.

3664
02:46:24,680 --> 02:46:27,420
I don't care if they don't like that.

3665
02:46:27,980 --> 02:46:29,820
They can... I'm on stream mode so they don't know.

3666
02:46:30,980 --> 02:46:31,440
Yay!

3667
02:46:32,460 --> 02:46:33,780
Yo, two lose.

3668
02:46:34,460 --> 02:46:35,260
You okay?

3669
02:46:36,620 --> 02:46:37,220
Yeah.

3670
02:46:37,520 --> 02:46:39,280
As long as you lose with...

3671
02:46:39,280 --> 02:46:41,320
As long as you lose with me.

3672
02:46:53,860 --> 02:46:54,660
What?

3673
02:46:54,700 --> 02:46:55,480
Okay, I'm banning.

3674
02:46:55,500 --> 02:46:56,480
Yeah, I'm banning anyway.

3675
02:47:02,940 --> 02:47:05,520
What the fuck does this mean?

3676
02:47:05,820 --> 02:47:06,300
What?

3677
02:47:06,700 --> 02:47:09,140
I can't trust him.

3678
02:47:10,200 --> 02:47:11,000
I...

3679
02:47:11,950 --> 02:47:14,260
What does that mean?

3680
02:47:22,590 --> 02:47:23,770
Okay.

3681
02:47:24,390 --> 02:47:26,270
Okay, I'm...

3682
02:47:26,270 --> 02:47:28,990
I don't... I'm not typing anything.

3683
02:47:29,630 --> 02:47:32,590
I'm not typing anything.

3684
02:47:33,290 --> 02:47:34,370
Guys,

3685
02:47:40,600 --> 02:47:41,780
I don't trust him.

3686
02:47:42,320 --> 02:47:44,240
I don't trust him.

3687
02:47:46,820 --> 02:47:48,360
Did we ban Adam?

3688
02:47:49,160 --> 02:47:50,060
Wait, we didn't.

3689
02:47:50,680 --> 02:47:51,780
What if I go Adam?

3690
02:47:53,200 --> 02:47:54,720
I want to go Adam.

3691
02:47:58,180 --> 02:47:59,060
Let's try.

3692
02:47:59,800 --> 02:48:01,080
Let's try this.

3693
02:48:02,020 --> 02:48:02,660
Okay.

3694
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:07,120
Alright, let's try.

3695
02:48:07,880 --> 02:48:09,380
We didn't ban Adam.

3696
02:48:09,580 --> 02:48:10,680
So it might work.

3697
02:48:13,300 --> 02:48:15,220
Adam with Starlord Res is always good.

3698
02:48:24,140 --> 02:48:24,620
Okay.

3699
02:48:24,720 --> 02:48:25,800
Okay, if it doesn't work, I'll swap.

3700
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,720
Oh, they actually...

3701
02:48:28,720 --> 02:48:31,200
No, they have the...

3702
02:48:31,200 --> 02:48:33,620
Yeah, they have the...

3703
02:48:35,400 --> 02:48:36,800
Oh, I did not want to use that.

3704
02:48:36,880 --> 02:48:37,760
That wasn't gonna...

3705
02:48:37,760 --> 02:48:39,620
I think I wasn't gonna get healing time.

3706
02:48:44,620 --> 02:48:46,540
Okay, I'm trying to be...

3707
02:48:46,540 --> 02:48:46,780
Whoa!

3708
02:48:49,840 --> 02:48:50,400
Okay.

3709
02:48:51,380 --> 02:48:52,520
Trying to be...

3710
02:48:53,460 --> 02:48:55,280
Selected with my heals right now.

3711
02:48:57,300 --> 02:48:57,860
What?!

3712
02:48:57,860 --> 02:48:58,960
Jesus Chri...

3713
02:48:58,960 --> 02:49:00,920
Oh my god, that's a hot guy right there.

3714
02:49:03,540 --> 02:49:05,180
That's a hot guy right there.

3715
02:49:05,820 --> 02:49:06,780
I don't have heals.

3716
02:49:08,940 --> 02:49:09,500
Okay.

3717
02:49:11,660 --> 02:49:12,800
Oh no, not halfway.

3718
02:49:16,160 --> 02:49:17,100
Oh no.

3719
02:49:21,350 --> 02:49:22,430
There we go.

3720
02:49:25,130 --> 02:49:26,730
Oh my god.

3721
02:49:28,150 --> 02:49:28,790
Nice.

3722
02:49:30,350 --> 02:49:31,270
I'll just stay here.

3723
02:49:32,430 --> 02:49:34,310
There's nothing bad's gonna...

3724
02:49:34,310 --> 02:49:35,450
Something bad happened to us.

3725
02:49:35,750 --> 02:49:36,910
Something bad happened to us.

3726
02:49:37,230 --> 02:49:39,790
Something absolutely terrible happened to us, guys.

3727
02:49:40,710 --> 02:49:41,350
Something...

3728
02:49:41,350 --> 02:49:43,890
Something bad happened to us.

3729
02:49:44,370 --> 02:49:45,010
Something...

3730
02:49:45,010 --> 02:49:45,890
Yes.

3731
02:49:49,530 --> 02:49:50,150
Guys.

3732
02:49:51,570 --> 02:49:52,810
Guys, I...

3733
02:49:52,810 --> 02:49:54,690
Think something bad happened to us.

3734
02:49:57,750 --> 02:49:59,570
Oh no, this is bad for me.

3735
02:50:00,130 --> 02:50:01,790
This is actually bad for me.

3736
02:50:03,210 --> 02:50:04,290
Oh, fuck.

3737
02:50:04,410 --> 02:50:04,650
Okay.

3738
02:50:05,190 --> 02:50:07,190
Well, I have rez, but...

3739
02:50:07,190 --> 02:50:08,530
Wait, they have one support?!

3740
02:50:09,450 --> 02:50:10,670
Wait a minute!

3741
02:50:11,530 --> 02:50:12,790
Wait a minute!

3742
02:50:13,950 --> 02:50:14,830
Wait a...

3743
02:50:14,830 --> 02:50:15,660
What the fuck?!

3744
02:50:16,470 --> 02:50:16,930
Okay.

3745
02:50:18,110 --> 02:50:21,090
Okay, I'm rezzing and then I'm fucking swapping to Luna.

3746
02:50:22,590 --> 02:50:24,010
One for one, okay.

3747
02:50:24,210 --> 02:50:25,510
We just need to kill Invis.

3748
02:50:26,470 --> 02:50:27,290
That's it.

3749
02:50:28,330 --> 02:50:29,910
Literally, that's our whole plan.

3750
02:50:33,070 --> 02:50:34,870
That's our entire plan.

3751
02:50:37,210 --> 02:50:37,870
Okay.

3752
02:50:39,310 --> 02:50:40,270
That's fine.

3753
02:50:42,370 --> 02:50:43,550
Oh my god.

3754
02:50:44,650 --> 02:50:45,970
Okay, that's...

3755
02:50:45,970 --> 02:50:47,430
Whoa, we used a lot of ults.

3756
02:50:50,990 --> 02:50:51,430
Whoa.

3757
02:50:52,790 --> 02:50:53,590
That's a lot.

3758
02:50:53,670 --> 02:50:54,450
Wait, what's behind us?

3759
02:50:54,470 --> 02:50:55,010
Who's behind us?

3760
02:50:55,330 --> 02:50:56,150
There's a Psylocke behind.

3761
02:51:01,590 --> 02:51:03,470
Oh no, he's fucking serious.

3762
02:51:05,110 --> 02:51:06,030
That's when you know.

3763
02:51:11,210 --> 02:51:13,010
Okay, that's when you know he's serious.

3764
02:51:17,380 --> 02:51:17,820
Okay.

3765
02:51:20,980 --> 02:51:23,740
Oh, I'm a little worried about...

3766
02:51:24,660 --> 02:51:26,440
Okay, wait, where is he going?

3767
02:51:30,940 --> 02:51:31,520
Okay.

3768
02:51:34,380 --> 02:51:36,040
Fuck me, I guess.

3769
02:51:36,800 --> 02:51:37,800
I guess.

3770
02:51:40,660 --> 02:51:41,780
I got headshot.

3771
02:51:42,880 --> 02:51:45,020
I got headshot, I guess.

3772
02:51:45,560 --> 02:51:48,100
Literally existed in the Luna ult just to die.

3773
02:51:48,240 --> 02:51:48,740
I love it.

3774
02:51:49,660 --> 02:51:51,340
I love it when that happens.

3775
02:51:52,500 --> 02:51:54,740
Don't you just love it when...

3776
02:51:57,060 --> 02:51:58,620
Yeah, I can rez this.

3777
02:52:05,580 --> 02:52:06,040
Okay.

3778
02:52:11,160 --> 02:52:12,560
Oh, you only have Adam heals.

3779
02:52:12,560 --> 02:52:12,760
Adam heals.

3780
02:52:15,320 --> 02:52:17,440
I mean, that's just like...

3781
02:52:17,440 --> 02:52:18,660
I have to use soul.

3782
02:52:22,660 --> 02:52:24,480
They've been 4 DPS since the beginning!

3783
02:52:26,160 --> 02:52:26,640
Yes!

3784
02:52:35,060 --> 02:52:35,540
Okay.

3785
02:52:45,590 --> 02:52:47,770
Oh, I do not have anything for that.

3786
02:52:50,960 --> 02:52:53,640
Bro, okay, this Hawkeye is insane.

3787
02:52:53,800 --> 02:52:55,420
This Hawkeye is actually insane.

3788
02:52:58,730 --> 02:53:00,410
Oh my god.

3789
02:53:01,010 --> 02:53:03,590
This Hawkeye is insane.

3790
02:53:09,730 --> 02:53:11,170
I'm soul bonding.

3791
02:53:16,850 --> 02:53:17,270
Nice.

3792
02:53:19,650 --> 02:53:20,290
Jesus.

3793
02:53:24,030 --> 02:53:24,630
Bro.

3794
02:53:24,830 --> 02:53:26,330
Oh my god.

3795
02:53:26,430 --> 02:53:27,110
Are they still...

3796
02:53:27,110 --> 02:53:28,490
They're still 4 DPS.

3797
02:53:28,710 --> 02:53:29,970
How are they getting away with this?

3798
02:53:30,730 --> 02:53:31,350
Oh my...

3799
02:53:31,350 --> 02:53:33,470
They just kill us before we can kill them.

3800
02:53:35,190 --> 02:53:35,990
Bro, I'm scared.

3801
02:53:36,170 --> 02:53:37,670
I'm actually scared of him.

3802
02:53:38,010 --> 02:53:39,470
There's Pupil behind us.

3803
02:53:42,570 --> 02:53:43,170
Oh,

3804
02:53:47,570 --> 02:53:49,510
I have ult, but I'm scared.

3805
02:53:52,410 --> 02:53:54,170
Oh my god.

3806
02:53:54,410 --> 02:53:54,810
I have res.

3807
02:54:00,920 --> 02:54:02,420
I have to soul bond us.

3808
02:54:02,760 --> 02:54:02,780
Oh!

3809
02:54:05,020 --> 02:54:05,540
No!

3810
02:54:09,570 --> 02:54:10,090
No!

3811
02:54:10,850 --> 02:54:12,950
Okay, their Hawkeye is actually fucking insane though.

3812
02:54:13,370 --> 02:54:14,810
I don't know if I should go Mantis.

3813
02:54:16,290 --> 02:54:17,430
Oh, fuck it.

3814
02:54:17,730 --> 02:54:18,610
I'll run back Luna.

3815
02:54:19,550 --> 02:54:20,670
Adam was not working.

3816
02:54:20,670 --> 02:54:21,970
We bubble Sven, okay?

3817
02:54:22,130 --> 02:54:22,690
Bubble Sven.

3818
02:54:25,070 --> 02:54:25,650
Alright.

3819
02:54:26,710 --> 02:54:27,210
Adam not working.

3820
02:54:27,410 --> 02:54:28,150
I go Luna.

3821
02:54:30,770 --> 02:54:31,910
How the fuck?

3822
02:54:32,130 --> 02:54:33,030
Jesus Christ.

3823
02:54:39,730 --> 02:54:40,930
They're fucking...

3824
02:54:40,930 --> 02:54:42,430
Their Hawkeye is actually crazy.

3825
02:54:47,210 --> 02:54:47,810
Goodbye.

3826
02:54:50,610 --> 02:54:51,890
I have a Psylocke behind me.

3827
02:54:55,430 --> 02:54:56,850
Oh my god.

3828
02:54:59,410 --> 02:55:01,230
We need help.

3829
02:55:02,650 --> 02:55:04,150
Backline needs help.

3830
02:55:05,570 --> 02:55:09,470
Help Backline or Backline cry.

3831
02:55:13,190 --> 02:55:13,990
Please.

3832
02:55:15,870 --> 02:55:18,970
Help Backline or Backline sad.

3833
02:55:23,990 --> 02:55:24,690
Please.

3834
02:55:26,430 --> 02:55:27,550
Backline cry.

3835
02:55:30,950 --> 02:55:33,510
I don't want to get deleted again.

3836
02:55:36,590 --> 02:55:37,690
Oh my god.

3837
02:55:38,410 --> 02:55:40,630
I'm like most afraid of...

3838
02:55:40,630 --> 02:55:46,250
I'm most afraid of like...

3839
02:55:46,250 --> 02:55:47,310
Okay, okay.

3840
02:55:48,730 --> 02:55:49,090
I'm in.

3841
02:55:49,830 --> 02:55:50,350
I'm in.

3842
02:55:50,630 --> 02:55:51,470
Oh my god.

3843
02:55:51,530 --> 02:55:53,270
Who the fuck is over there though?

3844
02:55:53,270 --> 02:55:53,450
Oh.

3845
02:55:58,570 --> 02:55:59,990
There's a Psylocke behind us.

3846
02:56:04,650 --> 02:56:05,810
Where is he?

3847
02:56:06,850 --> 02:56:08,010
Psylocke is still behind us.

3848
02:56:08,110 --> 02:56:08,430
I hear him.

3849
02:56:14,130 --> 02:56:15,130
Oh, he's over there.

3850
02:56:19,790 --> 02:56:20,910
Oh my god.

3851
02:56:21,010 --> 02:56:21,630
I don't...

3852
02:56:21,630 --> 02:56:22,270
Get him out of here.

3853
02:56:22,690 --> 02:56:23,550
Get him out of here.

3854
02:56:24,830 --> 02:56:26,110
Oh my god.

3855
02:56:27,310 --> 02:56:28,590
Out of...

3856
02:56:28,590 --> 02:56:32,930
The craziest part is that all the DPS did not swap out with DPS.

3857
02:56:36,690 --> 02:56:37,330
That's...

3858
02:56:37,330 --> 02:56:39,350
That's the craziest part.

3859
02:56:42,150 --> 02:56:43,490
This hot guy is scary.

3860
02:56:43,570 --> 02:56:45,330
I have no idea who the areas was...

3861
02:56:45,330 --> 02:56:46,110
Who areas...

3862
02:56:46,630 --> 02:56:47,930
Who this person was.

3863
02:56:48,970 --> 02:56:49,610
Yeah.

3864
02:56:51,890 --> 02:56:54,470
Honestly, we look like trash.

3865
02:56:57,110 --> 02:56:59,630
If only we had Choppa.

3866
02:57:18,070 --> 02:57:20,330
Gomez getting diff'd.

3867
02:57:35,930 --> 02:57:36,990
Choppa would carry.

3868
02:57:37,910 --> 02:57:39,070
Choppa would've carried.

3869
02:57:39,150 --> 02:57:40,030
You're so right.

3870
02:57:40,370 --> 02:57:41,090
He would've.

3871
02:57:42,090 --> 02:57:43,950
I wish Choppa was here, guys.

3872
02:57:49,310 --> 02:57:51,550
Choppa would've carried us all.

3873
02:57:54,450 --> 02:57:55,210
100%.

3874
02:58:05,670 --> 02:58:07,010
You need me.

3875
02:58:08,970 --> 02:58:09,390
5...

3876
02:58:10,430 --> 02:58:10,850
4...

3877
02:58:11,830 --> 02:58:12,250
3...

3878
02:58:12,250 --> 02:58:12,850
2...

3879
02:58:12,850 --> 02:58:13,370
I have 3.

3880
02:58:15,210 --> 02:58:15,730
Okay, okay.

3881
02:58:16,230 --> 02:58:17,270
I'm pushing, Kite.

3882
02:58:18,290 --> 02:58:19,130
Oh, you're so far.

3883
02:58:19,210 --> 02:58:19,710
You're so far.

3884
02:58:19,910 --> 02:58:20,150
Oh no.

3885
02:58:20,430 --> 02:58:21,010
No, it's okay.

3886
02:58:21,090 --> 02:58:21,390
It's okay.

3887
02:58:21,490 --> 02:58:21,750
It's okay.

3888
02:58:22,230 --> 02:58:23,930
Wait, they're two supports now.

3889
02:58:24,230 --> 02:58:24,670
It's okay.

3890
02:58:24,690 --> 02:58:25,230
Oh my god.

3891
02:58:25,530 --> 02:58:26,870
Why try now?

3892
02:58:28,130 --> 02:58:28,910
I love you too.

3893
02:58:29,990 --> 02:58:30,830
Oh my...

3894
02:58:32,830 --> 02:58:33,770
Oh my gosh.

3895
02:58:33,770 --> 02:58:34,190
Whoa.

3896
02:58:35,050 --> 02:58:36,010
What a bromance.

3897
02:58:36,390 --> 02:58:37,130
No homo.

3898
02:58:37,770 --> 02:58:38,910
Are all the homo?

3899
02:58:42,690 --> 02:58:43,710
Two supports.

3900
02:58:44,110 --> 02:58:45,930
No, don't say that.

3901
02:58:46,130 --> 02:58:47,170
Start believing.

3902
02:58:47,510 --> 02:58:48,930
Oh shit, there's a Hawkeye.

3903
02:58:50,290 --> 02:58:50,410
Okay.

3904
02:58:50,490 --> 02:58:51,330
I go here.

3905
02:58:51,450 --> 02:58:51,770
I go here.

3906
02:58:51,830 --> 02:58:52,270
Yeah, I go.

3907
02:58:52,330 --> 02:58:52,790
Okay, guys.

3908
02:58:53,070 --> 02:58:53,970
I stopped...

3909
02:58:54,990 --> 02:58:57,390
I stopped believing because I saw the Syla.

3910
02:58:57,730 --> 02:58:58,790
So I got scared.

3911
02:58:59,830 --> 02:59:00,910
Okay, start believing, guys.

3912
02:59:00,990 --> 02:59:01,890
Start believing in...

3913
02:59:01,890 --> 02:59:02,710
Guys, start believing.

3914
02:59:03,570 --> 02:59:04,390
Guys, it's possible.

3915
02:59:04,650 --> 02:59:05,550
Just start believing.

3916
02:59:05,670 --> 02:59:07,470
They're actually doing worse with two supports.

3917
02:59:07,530 --> 02:59:08,830
They should swap back to one.

3918
02:59:09,210 --> 02:59:10,110
They actually...

3919
02:59:10,710 --> 02:59:13,070
They actually should just go back to one.

3920
02:59:13,370 --> 02:59:14,230
Wait, they are.

3921
02:59:17,230 --> 02:59:18,190
They are.

3922
02:59:20,650 --> 02:59:21,990
They're like, wait a minute.

3923
02:59:22,070 --> 02:59:22,750
We're doing worse.

3924
02:59:23,610 --> 02:59:25,090
They have Rocket now.

3925
02:59:27,850 --> 02:59:29,370
They actually win.

3926
02:59:29,450 --> 02:59:30,410
That's crazy.

3927
02:59:30,410 --> 02:59:33,490
That's actually so fucking hilarious.

3928
02:59:44,550 --> 02:59:45,110
Okay.

3929
02:59:47,750 --> 02:59:49,190
Invis, use ult first.

3930
02:59:57,500 --> 02:59:58,440
Oh shit, nice.

3931
02:59:59,740 --> 03:00:00,100
Okay.

3932
03:00:00,460 --> 03:00:01,020
Okay.

3933
03:00:01,660 --> 03:00:04,760
I don't know if we needed to do it from here, but that's okay.

3934
03:00:06,980 --> 03:00:08,220
Oh my god.

3935
03:00:08,520 --> 03:00:10,540
Oh my god.

3936
03:00:10,820 --> 03:00:12,200
Where are we?

3937
03:00:12,860 --> 03:00:14,480
Oh my god.

3938
03:00:16,320 --> 03:00:17,460
We die.

3939
03:00:18,340 --> 03:00:19,380
Let's just...

3940
03:00:19,380 --> 03:00:20,960
Yeah, we just...

3941
03:00:20,960 --> 03:00:22,660
We just die, I guess.

3942
03:00:22,940 --> 03:00:23,200
Wait,

3943
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:28,240
they're running triple support.

3944
03:00:28,540 --> 03:00:29,400
Wait, what?

3945
03:00:30,660 --> 03:00:31,340
What happened?

3946
03:00:32,240 --> 03:00:34,920
Now they don't believe in themselves anymore?

3947
03:00:36,400 --> 03:00:39,140
None of the DPS believe now.

3948
03:00:39,960 --> 03:00:40,840
What happened?

3949
03:00:42,200 --> 03:00:46,220
Guys, I missed the four DPS comp.

3950
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:48,140
I think it would have worked.

3951
03:00:48,860 --> 03:00:49,580
They don't believe.

3952
03:00:50,840 --> 03:00:52,340
They don't fucking believe in themselves.

3953
03:00:52,660 --> 03:00:53,440
That's so sad.

3954
03:00:54,340 --> 03:00:55,760
Imagine not believing anymore.

3955
03:01:01,860 --> 03:01:03,200
Oh my god, no!

3956
03:01:04,880 --> 03:01:06,080
Nice, we have Rez.

3957
03:01:10,880 --> 03:01:13,240
Rez is back here.

3958
03:01:13,560 --> 03:01:15,380
I have a Psylocke behind.

3959
03:01:17,940 --> 03:01:19,120
Oh no.

3960
03:01:19,820 --> 03:01:22,240
We didn't see that Rez.

3961
03:01:22,420 --> 03:01:24,500
Wait, unless...

3962
03:01:24,500 --> 03:01:25,600
We still have Adam.

3963
03:01:27,140 --> 03:01:27,800
Yippee!

3964
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:29,080
Oh, I need to skate back.

3965
03:01:29,440 --> 03:01:30,000
I'm skating.

3966
03:01:30,420 --> 03:01:31,320
I'm skating.

3967
03:01:32,220 --> 03:01:33,960
I'm skating, guys.

3968
03:01:36,380 --> 03:01:38,000
I'm still skating.

3969
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:38,020
I'm skating.

3970
03:01:45,700 --> 03:01:48,300
Oh my god, what's going on?

3971
03:01:54,880 --> 03:01:55,540
No!

3972
03:01:56,810 --> 03:01:58,940
He took so much damage!

3973
03:02:00,770 --> 03:02:01,760
That's crazy!

3974
03:02:02,900 --> 03:02:03,300
I got it.

3975
03:02:06,980 --> 03:02:08,720
Come over, come over.

3976
03:02:08,960 --> 03:02:09,620
I'm damage boosting.

3977
03:02:09,980 --> 03:02:10,360
Get strange.

3978
03:02:13,020 --> 03:02:13,360
Get strange.

3979
03:02:15,140 --> 03:02:16,280
Is the Psylocke to the left?

3980
03:02:21,820 --> 03:02:23,120
Oh, I knew it!

3981
03:02:23,180 --> 03:02:24,300
I knew he had ult too!

3982
03:02:24,400 --> 03:02:25,360
I knew he had ult too!

3983
03:02:25,420 --> 03:02:26,500
I knew he had ult too!

3984
03:02:28,780 --> 03:02:30,140
I could see it!

3985
03:02:33,400 --> 03:02:35,460
It was there by the way!

3986
03:02:41,540 --> 03:02:42,980
Okay, that's unlucky.

3987
03:02:43,980 --> 03:02:44,460
That's...

3988
03:02:45,160 --> 03:02:46,000
That's unlucky.

3989
03:02:48,520 --> 03:02:50,160
I missed four support...

3990
03:02:50,160 --> 03:02:51,180
I missed four DPS.

3991
03:02:52,300 --> 03:02:53,680
I missed four DPS.

3992
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:56,160
When can we have our four DPS back?

3993
03:03:02,440 --> 03:03:04,880
Four DPS was so fun, guys.

3994
03:03:05,180 --> 03:03:06,200
It was so fun.

3995
03:03:10,340 --> 03:03:10,940
Jesus...

3996
03:03:10,940 --> 03:03:11,480
Stop!

3997
03:03:11,700 --> 03:03:12,000
Stop!

3998
03:03:12,140 --> 03:03:12,420
Stop!

3999
03:03:12,540 --> 03:03:12,920
Stop!

4000
03:03:13,060 --> 03:03:13,320
Stop!

4001
03:03:14,220 --> 03:03:15,200
Actually, you're feeding.

4002
03:03:15,200 --> 03:03:16,120
Stop.

4003
03:03:17,880 --> 03:03:19,460
Oh my god.

4004
03:03:20,260 --> 03:03:21,200
Oh my god.

4005
03:03:21,680 --> 03:03:21,900
Wait.

4006
03:03:22,540 --> 03:03:23,780
Wait, my mouse died!

4007
03:03:23,980 --> 03:03:25,380
Oh my god, no!

4008
03:03:32,820 --> 03:03:33,980
My mouse is dead!

4009
03:03:37,880 --> 03:03:39,680
Oh my god, she's through.

4010
03:03:40,280 --> 03:03:40,960
I actually did.

4011
03:03:41,500 --> 03:03:42,300
My mouse died.

4012
03:03:43,420 --> 03:03:44,040
Oh my god.

4013
03:03:51,780 --> 03:03:54,100
Oh my god, I'm so unlucky!

4014
03:03:56,620 --> 03:03:58,420
My mouse is dead!

4015
03:04:00,820 --> 03:04:02,260
That's so unlucky!

4016
03:04:02,480 --> 03:04:03,440
I'll touch if you TP.

4017
03:04:04,680 --> 03:04:05,760
Oh my god.

4018
03:04:06,340 --> 03:04:08,220
I can't believe that happened.

4019
03:04:09,060 --> 03:04:10,440
I can't believe!

4020
03:04:14,800 --> 03:04:15,880
Holy shit!

4021
03:04:15,920 --> 03:04:16,320
I got her.

4022
03:04:16,540 --> 03:04:17,640
No, no, no, I got her.

4023
03:04:19,080 --> 03:04:20,000
Nope, I got her.

4024
03:04:23,200 --> 03:04:24,400
Wait, we don't have passive!

4025
03:04:25,400 --> 03:04:25,620
Oh!

4026
03:04:25,980 --> 03:04:27,040
Oh, go Misu!

4027
03:04:43,920 --> 03:04:44,880
Oh my...

4028
03:04:44,880 --> 03:04:45,780
It's okay, they don't know.

4029
03:04:46,480 --> 03:04:48,400
It's okay, they don't know.

4030
03:04:49,940 --> 03:04:51,160
They don't know.

4031
03:04:53,280 --> 03:04:56,120
They don't know my mouse DC'd.

4032
03:04:56,120 --> 03:04:57,120
They actually don't know.

4033
03:04:57,340 --> 03:04:59,200
As long as they don't know...

4034
03:04:59,200 --> 03:05:03,860
As long as they don't know my mouse DC'd, it's fine.

4035
03:05:04,540 --> 03:05:06,020
Oh my god.

4036
03:05:07,140 --> 03:05:08,460
That's crazy.

4037
03:05:09,480 --> 03:05:10,100
I had...

4038
03:05:10,100 --> 03:05:11,900
My mouse was not charged.

4039
03:05:12,040 --> 03:05:14,820
I didn't realize I was playing on my...

4040
03:05:16,500 --> 03:05:17,160
Nobody's...

4041
03:05:17,160 --> 03:05:19,940
I didn't realize I was playing with like...

4042
03:05:19,940 --> 03:05:22,900
10% mouse battery when I started the stream.

4043
03:05:25,040 --> 03:05:25,520
I...

4044
03:05:28,620 --> 03:05:30,540
Guys, I was winning in solo queue.

4045
03:05:30,780 --> 03:05:31,600
That's all I'll say.

4046
03:05:38,460 --> 03:05:39,020
Guys...

4047
03:05:39,020 --> 03:05:40,640
I was winning in solo queue.

4048
03:05:42,120 --> 03:05:42,680
True.

4049
03:05:49,940 --> 03:05:52,120
One game is still one win.

4050
03:05:53,060 --> 03:05:54,340
It's still a win.

4051
03:05:55,040 --> 03:05:56,880
It's okay, I'm having a fun time though.

4052
03:05:57,560 --> 03:06:00,260
I'm having a fun time with Chopper.

4053
03:06:03,760 --> 03:06:05,000
And Chopper.

4054
03:06:07,860 --> 03:06:09,740
With just Chopper.

4055
03:06:09,740 --> 03:06:10,060
LOL

4056
03:06:24,800 --> 03:06:25,760
That's pretty good.

4057
03:06:25,820 --> 03:06:27,220
We have the same random player.

4058
03:06:35,370 --> 03:06:36,490
Is this...

4059
03:06:36,490 --> 03:06:37,410
The same guy?

4060
03:06:37,590 --> 03:06:38,190
Is this Stab?

4061
03:06:39,450 --> 03:06:40,950
Did we just ban Psylocke?

4062
03:06:41,170 --> 03:06:41,410
Okay.

4063
03:06:50,180 --> 03:06:51,340
What did I say?

4064
03:06:58,040 --> 03:06:58,980
It's okay.

4065
03:06:59,260 --> 03:07:00,580
Games will get better, right?

4066
03:07:01,900 --> 03:07:02,540
Guys...

4067
03:07:02,540 --> 03:07:06,020
Guys, games are getting better right now.

4068
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:08,300
This will be it.

4069
03:07:10,800 --> 03:07:14,460
This will be the moment where games get a little better.

4070
03:07:15,520 --> 03:07:17,360
Alright, who's gonna win that 50-50?

4071
03:07:18,120 --> 03:07:18,960
Oh, nice.

4072
03:07:20,420 --> 03:07:21,600
Can't get worse.

4073
03:07:21,880 --> 03:07:22,440
You're right.

4074
03:07:22,660 --> 03:07:23,660
Can't get worse.

4075
03:07:25,020 --> 03:07:26,860
Review, thank you for the tier 1 sub.

4076
03:07:26,940 --> 03:07:27,960
Thank you, thank you.

4077
03:07:28,140 --> 03:07:28,980
Oh my god.

4078
03:07:29,260 --> 03:07:30,720
How could it get worse?

4079
03:07:37,080 --> 03:07:37,700
It's okay.

4080
03:07:38,100 --> 03:07:39,060
We all know...

4081
03:07:39,780 --> 03:07:41,460
Who's the...

4082
03:07:42,060 --> 03:07:43,500
We all know...

4083
03:07:43,500 --> 03:07:44,940
Who's the lowest ranked player here.

4084
03:07:46,060 --> 03:07:46,780
It is Gomez.

4085
03:07:49,120 --> 03:07:49,680
MRI...

4086
03:07:49,680 --> 03:07:51,060
Sentinels did not treat them...

4087
03:07:51,760 --> 03:07:53,060
Well, not Sentinels.

4088
03:07:53,220 --> 03:07:55,000
But MRI did not treat Sentinels well.

4089
03:07:55,620 --> 03:07:56,360
In Fight Night.

4090
03:07:59,640 --> 03:08:01,440
Music makes people happy.

4091
03:08:01,660 --> 03:08:04,380
Nobody 6 sacks in high elo.

4092
03:08:05,020 --> 03:08:08,080
They have to wait like 6 hours to get a game.

4093
03:08:10,840 --> 03:08:11,480
You're right.

4094
03:08:13,100 --> 03:08:14,360
Wait, Raccoon.

4095
03:08:14,520 --> 03:08:16,330
Or maybe it's just for the heals.

4096
03:08:17,600 --> 03:08:18,480
I need to put it on Groot.

4097
03:08:19,880 --> 03:08:20,540
I'm Groot.

4098
03:08:21,200 --> 03:08:22,340
I am Groot.

4099
03:08:23,240 --> 03:08:24,980
Can't wait to get Groot dipped.

4100
03:08:26,120 --> 03:08:26,740
Woah!

4101
03:08:29,160 --> 03:08:33,740
They queue their matches before bed so it's ready when they wake up.

4102
03:08:34,600 --> 03:08:36,060
That's actually smart.

4103
03:08:36,940 --> 03:08:39,060
Their alarm is when the game queues up.

4104
03:08:39,240 --> 03:08:39,700
Gets in.

4105
03:08:40,620 --> 03:08:44,300
I actually wanna see like people 6 sacking and just see how long the queue is.

4106
03:08:44,400 --> 03:08:47,060
They just like leave their PC on and just see how long it'll take.

4107
03:08:48,540 --> 03:08:50,440
Oh my god, it's so hard playing with a wired mouse.

4108
03:08:51,760 --> 03:08:53,320
I do not like...

4109
03:08:53,320 --> 03:08:54,140
Oh my god.

4110
03:08:55,440 --> 03:08:56,400
I hate...

4111
03:08:56,400 --> 03:08:57,120
I hate this.

4112
03:08:58,010 --> 03:08:58,640
I hate...

4113
03:08:58,640 --> 03:09:00,040
I hate this.

4114
03:09:00,320 --> 03:09:01,800
I hate this so much.

4115
03:09:02,940 --> 03:09:04,260
I hate this.

4116
03:09:05,900 --> 03:09:07,420
Oh my god.

4117
03:09:09,540 --> 03:09:11,260
It is not fun.

4118
03:09:13,180 --> 03:09:14,580
Oh my god, my aim.

4119
03:09:16,340 --> 03:09:17,380
My aim.

4120
03:09:17,620 --> 03:09:18,660
You see that?

4121
03:09:19,120 --> 03:09:20,680
I didn't even know I was aiming at anybody.

4122
03:09:20,680 --> 03:09:22,880
He went to Human Torch?

4123
03:09:23,120 --> 03:09:23,960
Wait, does he just throw?

4124
03:09:24,580 --> 03:09:26,240
Does he just throw?

4125
03:09:26,880 --> 03:09:28,420
Don't jinx us.

4126
03:09:28,920 --> 03:09:30,000
Oh my god.

4127
03:09:30,220 --> 03:09:32,580
He died because you said that.

4128
03:09:35,180 --> 03:09:35,940
We actually...

4129
03:09:36,200 --> 03:09:38,940
We actually lost fucking to the Human Torch.

4130
03:09:43,260 --> 03:09:44,640
That's crazy.

4131
03:09:45,180 --> 03:09:47,060
That's actually so funny.

4132
03:09:47,400 --> 03:09:48,060
We fucking...

4133
03:09:52,680 --> 03:09:53,800
I'm ulting in.

4134
03:09:57,410 --> 03:09:58,340
Oh god.

4135
03:09:58,520 --> 03:09:59,220
Oh god.

4136
03:09:59,400 --> 03:10:00,200
Oh god.

4137
03:10:00,980 --> 03:10:01,500
Oh god.

4138
03:10:05,060 --> 03:10:05,680
Okay.

4139
03:10:08,840 --> 03:10:10,080
I like...

4140
03:10:10,080 --> 03:10:11,340
I like he's like...

4141
03:10:11,340 --> 03:10:12,400
Oh, so he's throwing.

4142
03:10:13,020 --> 03:10:14,780
And he's throwing because we banned Psylocke.

4143
03:10:14,960 --> 03:10:16,980
And then literally our Bucky dies.

4144
03:10:17,220 --> 03:10:18,980
By the Human Torch.

4145
03:10:20,160 --> 03:10:22,000
That's actually crazy.

4146
03:10:25,840 --> 03:10:27,900
Tronny heard you talking shit.

4147
03:10:38,480 --> 03:10:39,380
That was scary.

4148
03:10:40,260 --> 03:10:42,220
I just got hit by like a giant ball of fire.

4149
03:10:42,680 --> 03:10:45,260
Like I didn't know how to fucking...

4150
03:10:45,260 --> 03:10:46,900
How to fucking react to that.

4151
03:10:47,640 --> 03:10:48,200
Oh.

4152
03:10:49,120 --> 03:10:49,960
Oh.

4153
03:10:50,600 --> 03:10:51,280
Oh.

4154
03:10:51,920 --> 03:10:52,360
Oh.

4155
03:10:53,640 --> 03:10:54,760
Please.

4156
03:10:55,420 --> 03:10:55,900
Please.

4157
03:10:55,980 --> 03:10:56,640
Am I okay?

4158
03:10:58,060 --> 03:10:58,240
No!

4159
03:11:04,740 --> 03:11:05,920
I'm not okay.

4160
03:11:09,660 --> 03:11:10,940
Was not okay.

4161
03:11:12,600 --> 03:11:13,700
What did he say?

4162
03:11:15,460 --> 03:11:16,080
Can't tell.

4163
03:11:16,080 --> 03:11:17,160
They used everything though.

4164
03:11:17,520 --> 03:11:18,340
They still have...

4165
03:11:19,300 --> 03:11:20,020
I couldn't tell.

4166
03:11:20,080 --> 03:11:21,320
He was like mumbling so much.

4167
03:11:27,060 --> 03:11:31,920
Oh my god, Tree.

4168
03:11:32,480 --> 03:11:33,860
Don't die, Tree.

4169
03:11:34,900 --> 03:11:35,900
Don't die.

4170
03:11:37,640 --> 03:11:38,540
Oh god.

4171
03:11:40,100 --> 03:11:41,500
Don't die, Tree.

4172
03:11:42,900 --> 03:11:43,300
Oh!

4173
03:11:44,300 --> 03:11:45,480
Tree.

4174
03:11:47,300 --> 03:11:48,940
I might be dead.

4175
03:11:52,300 --> 03:11:53,100
Nice.

4176
03:11:57,300 --> 03:11:58,480
Nice, we're okay.

4177
03:12:00,560 --> 03:12:01,960
Yeah?

4178
03:12:06,200 --> 03:12:07,840
What did he say?

4179
03:12:07,840 --> 03:12:09,280
What is...

4180
03:12:11,760 --> 03:12:12,860
What is...

4181
03:12:12,860 --> 03:12:14,060
What did he say?

4182
03:12:14,520 --> 03:12:16,640
What is...

4183
03:12:16,640 --> 03:12:17,840
Yo, no die.

4184
03:12:18,040 --> 03:12:19,160
I whip you.

4185
03:12:19,640 --> 03:12:21,120
I extra die.

4186
03:12:36,680 --> 03:12:38,180
You're right.

4187
03:12:38,940 --> 03:12:44,980
How could I give up when I have number one mercy player.

4188
03:12:51,740 --> 03:12:53,420
Thank god.

4189
03:12:55,280 --> 03:12:55,940
I can't.

4190
03:13:00,640 --> 03:13:01,840
Oh my god.

4191
03:13:06,100 --> 03:13:08,860
Wait, that was just an AK-47.

4192
03:13:09,360 --> 03:13:11,120
Where the fuck did that...

4193
03:13:12,240 --> 03:13:15,220
Never give up like John Cena.

4194
03:13:15,220 --> 03:13:15,540
Wait.

4195
03:13:19,780 --> 03:13:20,580
Jesus.

4196
03:13:24,080 --> 03:13:25,980
Never give up, guys.

4197
03:13:26,980 --> 03:13:27,540
Remember what...

4198
03:13:28,640 --> 03:13:31,800
Now John Cena didn't even say that.

4199
03:13:34,440 --> 03:13:36,520
I didn't even let John Cena think.

4200
03:13:42,020 --> 03:13:43,060
Oh my god.

4201
03:13:44,340 --> 03:13:44,760
Nice.

4202
03:14:00,370 --> 03:14:03,430
I'm not gonna say more on what he just said.

4203
03:14:03,830 --> 03:14:05,710
I'll just say, how do you say invisible woman in Japanese?

4204
03:14:05,810 --> 03:14:06,770
But then I got scared.

4205
03:14:07,170 --> 03:14:08,270
I don't know what he'll say.

4206
03:14:09,530 --> 03:14:12,410
Wait, you die.

4207
03:14:16,080 --> 03:14:18,260
You can die, you can die, you can die.

4208
03:14:19,900 --> 03:14:21,700
I will, I will.

4209
03:14:25,640 --> 03:14:27,040
Oh my god.

4210
03:14:28,620 --> 03:14:33,100
Okay, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

4211
03:14:39,840 --> 03:14:41,240
I die.

4212
03:14:50,570 --> 03:14:52,450
Wait, he lied.

4213
03:14:54,190 --> 03:14:55,270
Chopper lied.

4214
03:14:57,750 --> 03:14:59,850
Wait, he lied.

4215
03:14:59,990 --> 03:15:01,590
He said I would never die.

4216
03:15:04,210 --> 03:15:05,750
I believe it.

4217
03:15:06,510 --> 03:15:07,470
He lied to me.

4218
03:15:08,170 --> 03:15:09,590
He told me it would never happen.

4219
03:15:14,310 --> 03:15:16,110
He said it would never happen.

4220
03:15:16,250 --> 03:15:17,110
How did it happen?

4221
03:15:20,450 --> 03:15:21,610
I got him, I got him.

4222
03:15:21,650 --> 03:15:22,330
He's fine.

4223
03:15:28,230 --> 03:15:28,790
Wait,

4224
03:15:36,130 --> 03:15:36,830
Torch, Torch, Torch.

4225
03:15:37,150 --> 03:15:37,650
First one.

4226
03:15:43,630 --> 03:15:44,190
What?

4227
03:15:47,430 --> 03:15:48,710
The fuck was that?

4228
03:15:49,230 --> 03:15:50,190
He lied twice.

4229
03:15:50,350 --> 03:15:51,090
He did.

4230
03:15:51,650 --> 03:15:52,850
He lied twice.

4231
03:15:54,890 --> 03:15:55,850
I can't believe it.

4232
03:15:56,550 --> 03:16:01,990
Never believe when they say, don't worry, you don't die.

4233
03:16:02,290 --> 03:16:03,070
Don't believe.

4234
03:16:05,230 --> 03:16:06,350
It's a lie.

4235
03:16:07,510 --> 03:16:08,870
What the fuck?

4236
03:16:09,170 --> 03:16:10,530
That's actually bullshit.

4237
03:16:11,170 --> 03:16:13,850
I should not have died like that.

4238
03:16:14,210 --> 03:16:15,470
That's actually bullshit.

4239
03:16:21,200 --> 03:16:23,880
I have no idea who the fuck I froze there.

4240
03:16:25,440 --> 03:16:26,220
You first, you first, Torch.

4241
03:16:28,560 --> 03:16:28,900
Okay.

4242
03:16:35,620 --> 03:16:36,040
Alright.

4243
03:16:36,920 --> 03:16:37,440
Wait, shield.

4244
03:16:39,560 --> 03:16:40,400
Okay.

4245
03:16:45,630 --> 03:16:46,070
Two.

4246
03:16:46,410 --> 03:16:46,830
One.

4247
03:16:49,870 --> 03:16:51,150
Mag on point.

4248
03:16:58,400 --> 03:17:00,440
Oh my god, I can aim.

4249
03:17:01,280 --> 03:17:02,780
Oh my god.

4250
03:17:03,440 --> 03:17:04,500
We did it.

4251
03:17:06,200 --> 03:17:07,420
Oh my god.

4252
03:17:08,600 --> 03:17:13,440
Chop, potty, better support than tank.

4253
03:17:20,640 --> 03:17:21,400
True.

4254
03:17:28,180 --> 03:17:30,120
Oh my god, we did it.

4255
03:17:30,180 --> 03:17:31,400
We broke the cycle.

4256
03:17:31,940 --> 03:17:33,340
We broke the curse.

4257
03:17:33,860 --> 03:17:34,960
Damn, dude.

4258
03:17:38,200 --> 03:17:39,100
That's not true.

4259
03:17:39,220 --> 03:17:42,740
That is, in what fucking world am I a better DPS than support?

4260
03:17:43,300 --> 03:17:45,920
And why are you cooking my dude?

4261
03:17:46,580 --> 03:17:48,140
He consented!

4262
03:17:48,520 --> 03:17:50,140
Look, look, look.

4263
03:17:50,340 --> 03:17:51,260
Right here.

4264
03:17:52,180 --> 03:17:54,200
I'm going to retire from tank.

4265
03:17:54,420 --> 03:17:55,600
I go support win.

4266
03:17:55,800 --> 03:17:56,940
Go tank lose.

4267
03:17:57,380 --> 03:17:58,960
And I'll eat better.

4268
03:17:59,840 --> 03:18:01,780
He literally consented.

4269
03:18:03,500 --> 03:18:05,000
It's not my fault.

4270
03:18:10,640 --> 03:18:11,700
Oh my god, you're right.

4271
03:18:11,880 --> 03:18:12,740
It's because I pulled.

4272
03:18:12,880 --> 03:18:13,160
You're right.

4273
03:18:13,180 --> 03:18:16,100
Oh my god, I forgot my incredible Starlord game right there.

4274
03:18:16,640 --> 03:18:18,000
You're so right, guys.

4275
03:18:18,160 --> 03:18:19,080
You're so right, chat.

4276
03:18:19,260 --> 03:18:26,100
I almost forgot about that incredible Starlord game that I played on my other monitor.

4277
03:18:30,940 --> 03:18:32,240
Oh my gosh.

4278
03:18:32,340 --> 03:18:33,760
How could I forget, chat?

4279
03:18:33,760 --> 03:18:40,700
I can't believe I would forget such a monumentous play that I just did there on my other PC.

4280
03:18:42,640 --> 03:18:43,180
Honestly, yeah.

4281
03:18:43,260 --> 03:18:44,760
That's why I could've...

4282
03:18:44,760 --> 03:18:46,980
Honestly, I could be like...

4283
03:18:46,980 --> 03:18:55,000
I could be like top 10 right now if I wasn't, you know, if I was actually playing on one account.

4284
03:18:55,560 --> 03:18:58,600
But I just have to nerf myself in some way, you know, chat?

4285
03:19:03,760 --> 03:19:05,740
Yeah, it just wouldn't be fair.

4286
03:19:06,060 --> 03:19:09,760
It literally just wouldn't be fair to everybody around me.

4287
03:19:10,840 --> 03:19:11,560
Right.

4288
03:19:14,820 --> 03:19:16,260
Yeah, exactly.

4289
03:19:17,500 --> 03:19:18,860
Thank god I'm private profile.

4290
03:19:21,280 --> 03:19:24,280
So other players can't judge me.

4291
03:19:24,700 --> 03:19:25,820
Alright, we'll do...

4292
03:19:25,820 --> 03:19:27,380
Okay, livestream three hours.

4293
03:19:27,520 --> 03:19:28,880
Okay, we'll do...

4294
03:19:28,880 --> 03:19:30,860
We'll do one more.

4295
03:19:31,040 --> 03:19:31,780
One LG.

4296
03:19:31,780 --> 03:19:33,040
This is LG.

4297
03:19:34,340 --> 03:19:35,940
And we'll lose, but like, this is LG.

4298
03:19:36,380 --> 03:19:37,660
We won't lose!

4299
03:19:37,800 --> 03:19:40,060
Never give up, like what Choppa said.

4300
03:19:40,160 --> 03:19:41,360
Never give up like John Cena.

4301
03:19:43,500 --> 03:19:46,120
Guys, I hope I don't get cancelled when I wake up.

4302
03:19:47,540 --> 03:19:48,660
It's like...

4303
03:19:50,260 --> 03:19:50,820
Guys...

4304
03:19:50,820 --> 03:19:54,020
Choppa views do not represent me.

4305
03:19:55,700 --> 03:19:59,100
His views do not represent me, guys.

4306
03:20:00,480 --> 03:20:02,360
Ranking Twitlonger right now.

4307
03:20:09,700 --> 03:20:10,640
It's okay.

4308
03:20:11,600 --> 03:20:12,500
It's okay.

4309
03:20:13,360 --> 03:20:13,700
I...

4310
03:20:13,700 --> 03:20:17,160
I don't know if it's okay, but like, it's okay.

4311
03:20:18,000 --> 03:20:19,140
It's okay.

4312
03:20:20,740 --> 03:20:22,520
Oh shit, Nekros is playing.

4313
03:20:22,620 --> 03:20:23,780
Okay, he's in practice range.

4314
03:20:23,840 --> 03:20:25,200
I don't have to worry about that.

4315
03:20:25,880 --> 03:20:26,800
Wait, did Pearl...

4316
03:20:26,800 --> 03:20:27,980
Is Pearl's rank right now?

4317
03:20:28,240 --> 03:20:29,580
Oh my god!

4318
03:20:29,680 --> 03:20:30,800
He climbed to five...

4319
03:20:30,800 --> 03:20:31,100
Oh.

4320
03:20:32,460 --> 03:20:32,840
Whoa.

4321
03:20:32,840 --> 03:20:35,020
I know he always duos with...

4322
03:20:35,920 --> 03:20:36,820
No, he didn't.

4323
03:20:37,040 --> 03:20:40,020
Usually he always plays with a Mantis player.

4324
03:20:41,560 --> 03:20:42,640
Pearl is like...

4325
03:20:42,640 --> 03:20:47,900
I know two Widow players that are really scary.

4326
03:20:48,180 --> 03:20:49,440
And it's Pearl and i8.

4327
03:20:50,240 --> 03:20:51,700
I do not...

4328
03:20:51,700 --> 03:20:56,140
Like, I am very scared of Pearl and i8's Widow.

4329
03:20:59,940 --> 03:21:01,180
Not sure for it.

4330
03:21:03,220 --> 03:21:04,300
Not as...

4331
03:21:04,300 --> 03:21:05,840
He doesn't one trick Widow.

4332
03:21:05,900 --> 03:21:06,580
That's the thing.

4333
03:21:07,700 --> 03:21:08,300
But Pearl...

4334
03:21:08,900 --> 03:21:10,200
Pearl and...

4335
03:21:10,200 --> 03:21:13,100
Pearl and i8 one trick Widow.

4336
03:21:13,760 --> 03:21:16,120
Pearl has been hackusated so many times.

4337
03:21:17,660 --> 03:21:20,300
Number one player of the year.

4338
03:21:20,440 --> 03:21:21,900
Be my mercy damage boost.

4339
03:21:22,740 --> 03:21:23,600
Mercy pocket.

4340
03:21:24,080 --> 03:21:25,760
Number one mercy player.

4341
03:21:25,960 --> 03:21:27,260
Player of the year.

4342
03:21:27,560 --> 03:21:28,340
What's PO?

4343
03:21:28,500 --> 03:21:28,620
What?

4344
03:21:29,580 --> 03:21:30,260
Player...

4345
03:21:30,260 --> 03:21:31,320
Of the year.

4346
03:21:31,620 --> 03:21:33,180
What the fuck is he talking about?

4347
03:21:37,140 --> 03:21:37,900
It's alright.

4348
03:21:38,180 --> 03:21:39,420
I've already been in a Necros.

4349
03:21:39,860 --> 03:21:42,160
I've already been in a Necros clip but...

4350
03:21:42,160 --> 03:21:44,000
I can be in another one.

4351
03:21:45,760 --> 03:21:46,940
Oh, Potty!

4352
03:21:47,900 --> 03:21:50,780
For some reason I thought he said player of the year.

4353
03:21:51,300 --> 03:21:52,900
He was trying to say Potty.

4354
03:21:53,300 --> 03:21:55,180
It's like...

4355
03:21:55,180 --> 03:21:58,960
I thought he was trying to say...

4356
03:21:59,300 --> 03:22:00,860
I'm so confused.

4357
03:22:00,860 --> 03:22:02,440
I like one trick.

4358
03:22:02,580 --> 03:22:03,680
I like one trick again.

4359
03:22:04,300 --> 03:22:06,880
I thought he said player of the year.

4360
03:22:07,060 --> 03:22:07,900
I don't know why.

4361
03:22:08,260 --> 03:22:10,060
I thought he said Potty.

4362
03:22:14,660 --> 03:22:16,040
Fuck that guy.

4363
03:22:18,040 --> 03:22:19,240
I don't know why.

4364
03:22:19,400 --> 03:22:20,180
I forgot his name.

4365
03:22:20,600 --> 03:22:22,280
I forgot his name is Potty.

4366
03:22:23,520 --> 03:22:24,720
No, I'm not okay.

4367
03:22:25,680 --> 03:22:26,820
I'm not okay.

4368
03:22:26,920 --> 03:22:28,080
This is LG for me.

4369
03:22:30,860 --> 03:22:33,320
Nemo and then Groot.

4370
03:22:35,840 --> 03:22:37,300
We ban Groot.

4371
03:22:40,380 --> 03:22:44,960
We ban Groot?

4372
03:22:45,340 --> 03:22:46,300
Can we do it?

4373
03:22:47,420 --> 03:22:49,680
Why does he want to play Groot?

4374
03:22:52,740 --> 03:22:53,280
Hello?

4375
03:22:57,160 --> 03:22:59,800
This is his fault.

4376
03:23:00,940 --> 03:23:04,320
Wait, this is my fault because he's me.

4377
03:23:04,660 --> 03:23:06,580
I'm him.

4378
03:23:09,820 --> 03:23:10,740
Who's Ubi?

4379
03:23:14,220 --> 03:23:14,880
Who's Ubi?

4380
03:23:15,960 --> 03:23:20,020
I have no idea who Ubi is.

4381
03:23:20,800 --> 03:23:22,360
How much battery I have?

4382
03:23:24,820 --> 03:23:25,620
Okay, 28.

4383
03:23:25,740 --> 03:23:27,880
Guys, LG, 28%.

4384
03:23:27,880 --> 03:23:28,960
I can do it.

4385
03:23:30,860 --> 03:23:32,400
28% on my mouse.

4386
03:23:32,720 --> 03:23:33,680
It's doable.

4387
03:23:34,540 --> 03:23:35,520
It's so doable.

4388
03:23:41,410 --> 03:23:44,750
My time is now like John Cena.

4389
03:23:46,910 --> 03:23:47,590
Okay.

4390
03:23:48,070 --> 03:23:49,310
This is fine.

4391
03:23:50,330 --> 03:23:50,850
This works.

4392
03:23:58,860 --> 03:24:00,220
You're watching me.

4393
03:24:00,480 --> 03:24:02,740
We're watching DokiBird on two different accounts.

4394
03:24:02,940 --> 03:24:03,820
That's who you're watching.

4395
03:24:04,800 --> 03:24:05,420
I'm me.

4396
03:24:05,760 --> 03:24:07,060
I'm her.

4397
03:24:08,740 --> 03:24:09,460
I'm Doki.

4398
03:24:10,580 --> 03:24:12,660
Potty might as well be my- Wait, no, he's not.

4399
03:24:13,160 --> 03:24:14,300
He has some fucked up shit.

4400
03:24:14,380 --> 03:24:16,020
I do not want to be associated with Potty.

4401
03:24:22,940 --> 03:24:25,460
I'm all of them except for Potty.

4402
03:24:28,400 --> 03:24:31,240
I gotta make sure.

4403
03:24:32,580 --> 03:24:34,680
I don't want to be canceled.

4404
03:24:38,030 --> 03:24:39,490
Oh, I need to reload.

4405
03:24:40,610 --> 03:24:41,650
Oh, wow.

4406
03:24:43,010 --> 03:24:43,690
Three top again.

4407
03:24:43,910 --> 03:24:44,290
Oh, two top.

4408
03:24:44,390 --> 03:24:45,950
Oh my god.

4409
03:24:48,870 --> 03:24:51,290
Jesus Christ, so much damage.

4410
03:24:52,470 --> 03:24:54,170
There's so much damage.

4411
03:24:54,170 --> 03:24:54,770
Dammit.

4412
03:24:55,330 --> 03:24:57,390
All I'm doing is healing.

4413
03:25:00,390 --> 03:25:02,410
This is all I'm doing.

4414
03:25:06,180 --> 03:25:07,300
Oh my god.

4415
03:25:08,340 --> 03:25:09,640
Doing that thing.

4416
03:25:12,620 --> 03:25:13,840
Oh my god.

4417
03:25:17,800 --> 03:25:18,920
You all first.

4418
03:25:18,980 --> 03:25:19,400
You all first.

4419
03:25:25,530 --> 03:25:26,810
Oh my god.

4420
03:25:28,230 --> 03:25:29,070
It's fine.

4421
03:25:32,690 --> 03:25:34,010
Are they gonna triple support?

4422
03:25:34,150 --> 03:25:34,850
They are.

4423
03:25:36,090 --> 03:25:37,470
Maybe I just freeze them.

4424
03:25:37,930 --> 03:25:39,370
Oh my god, I don't know who it is!

4425
03:25:39,850 --> 03:25:40,410
Get frozen!

4426
03:25:41,850 --> 03:25:44,370
I love it when they all stand in one line for me.

4427
03:25:45,310 --> 03:25:46,270
It's really helpful.

4428
03:25:48,110 --> 03:25:48,970
Um, okay.

4429
03:25:56,030 --> 03:25:57,050
Okay, it's fine.

4430
03:25:57,410 --> 03:25:58,930
I don't feel fine.

4431
03:25:59,070 --> 03:25:59,250
Oh.

4432
03:25:59,890 --> 03:26:00,450
Okay.

4433
03:26:02,190 --> 03:26:02,750
Okay.

4434
03:26:04,630 --> 03:26:05,510
It's okay.

4435
03:26:05,910 --> 03:26:07,510
It's not okay, but it's okay.

4436
03:26:13,130 --> 03:26:13,930
I believe...

4437
03:26:13,930 --> 03:26:14,570
They have...

4438
03:26:14,570 --> 03:26:15,730
They still have human torch ult.

4439
03:26:15,790 --> 03:26:16,270
That's why I didn't...

4440
03:26:16,270 --> 03:26:19,010
I didn't ult because they still have human torch ult, so there was no point.

4441
03:26:19,530 --> 03:26:20,470
We were already down one.

4442
03:26:21,170 --> 03:26:21,810
See, look at that.

4443
03:26:22,250 --> 03:26:22,650
Analysis.

4444
03:26:24,090 --> 03:26:25,910
That's how you use your brain!

4445
03:26:27,370 --> 03:26:28,450
Oh my god, I'm in a square.

4446
03:26:30,550 --> 03:26:31,570
There we go!

4447
03:26:31,570 --> 03:26:32,310
There we go!

4448
03:26:39,590 --> 03:26:40,910
Damn it.

4449
03:26:41,970 --> 03:26:43,130
I did it, I did it, I did it.

4450
03:26:48,150 --> 03:26:48,810
Oh.

4451
03:26:49,290 --> 03:26:50,390
That's unfortunate.

4452
03:26:53,510 --> 03:26:55,390
That's very unfortunate for me.

4453
03:26:56,090 --> 03:26:56,910
JK, I'm alive.

4454
03:27:02,760 --> 03:27:03,800
Oh my god, three low.

4455
03:27:03,980 --> 03:27:04,320
Please.

4456
03:27:04,320 --> 03:27:04,400
Please.

4457
03:27:06,820 --> 03:27:08,140
Oh my god, I'm okay.

4458
03:27:09,500 --> 03:27:10,360
I'm so...

4459
03:27:10,360 --> 03:27:11,980
I'm not, but like, I'm okay.

4460
03:27:16,970 --> 03:27:18,490
Oh my god, he's doing that thing.

4461
03:27:19,130 --> 03:27:20,010
And he's dead.

4462
03:27:23,890 --> 03:27:24,790
Okay, nice.

4463
03:27:25,990 --> 03:27:26,850
Double kill.

4464
03:27:29,790 --> 03:27:30,710
Please tell me.

4465
03:27:31,430 --> 03:27:32,270
Please tell me.

4466
03:27:33,090 --> 03:27:33,390
Please.

4467
03:27:37,960 --> 03:27:38,610
Big one.

4468
03:27:40,430 --> 03:27:41,170
Poopy.

4469
03:27:42,670 --> 03:27:44,210
Ban him in your chat.

4470
03:27:45,030 --> 03:27:45,430
I will.

4471
03:27:45,930 --> 03:27:47,750
I believed in the power of stole bond.

4472
03:27:49,130 --> 03:27:50,290
Ban him.

4473
03:27:50,510 --> 03:27:51,910
That's what we did.

4474
03:27:53,070 --> 03:27:55,690
Oh my god, we lost because of it!

4475
03:27:58,790 --> 03:28:00,410
Oh my god.

4476
03:28:02,890 --> 03:28:03,630
Why?

4477
03:28:04,590 --> 03:28:05,010
Why?

4478
03:28:05,610 --> 03:28:07,230
Why we have three supports?

4479
03:28:11,250 --> 03:28:14,610
We have three supports, why are you scared?

4480
03:28:18,770 --> 03:28:21,230
How could you be scared?

4481
03:28:22,110 --> 03:28:24,010
There's three of us.

4482
03:28:29,080 --> 03:28:30,580
Oh my god.

4483
03:28:32,200 --> 03:28:33,480
Oh my god.

4484
03:28:35,000 --> 03:28:35,940
Where's my...

4485
03:28:36,920 --> 03:28:37,720
Where are they?

4486
03:28:39,040 --> 03:28:39,680
I...

4487
03:28:39,680 --> 03:28:40,540
Oh, damage.

4488
03:28:47,670 --> 03:28:48,350
Okay.

4489
03:28:49,330 --> 03:28:50,010
Goodbye.

4490
03:28:52,350 --> 03:28:53,030
Unless...

4491
03:28:54,410 --> 03:28:55,090
Unless...

4492
03:28:55,090 --> 03:28:56,030
No goodbye.

4493
03:28:57,770 --> 03:28:58,190
Goodbye.

4494
03:28:59,690 --> 03:29:00,790
I think this is...

4495
03:29:00,790 --> 03:29:01,710
This is goodbye.

4496
03:29:02,410 --> 03:29:02,930
Right there.

4497
03:29:04,010 --> 03:29:05,350
No, that's definitely goodbye.

4498
03:29:05,510 --> 03:29:05,990
No, that's...

4499
03:29:12,530 --> 03:29:13,830
Oh my god.

4500
03:29:15,610 --> 03:29:17,990
Okay, not LG, I'm avoiding Ube.

4501
03:29:21,710 --> 03:29:27,390
I will not have anybody throwing my game for stream snipe content.

4502
03:29:28,190 --> 03:29:29,130
I refuse.

4503
03:29:34,170 --> 03:29:35,090
Alright.

4504
03:29:41,910 --> 03:29:43,930
Oh my god, goodbye.

4505
03:29:46,250 --> 03:29:47,110
Oh no.

4506
03:29:53,080 --> 03:29:56,180
I'm trying my best to keep you alive, but it's very difficult.

4507
03:29:57,700 --> 03:29:58,900
It's very difficult.

4508
03:30:00,520 --> 03:30:01,880
I'm trying so hard to keep you alive.

4509
03:30:01,960 --> 03:30:03,400
Oh my god, there was no way.

4510
03:30:04,040 --> 03:30:04,920
There was no way.

4511
03:30:05,240 --> 03:30:06,220
We were just dead dead.

4512
03:30:07,340 --> 03:30:09,220
We were actually just dead dead.

4513
03:30:14,660 --> 03:30:15,500
Yeah, oh.

4514
03:30:17,300 --> 03:30:18,020
Oh.

4515
03:30:19,220 --> 03:30:20,400
You all first.

4516
03:30:24,450 --> 03:30:25,170
Okay.

4517
03:30:32,590 --> 03:30:33,690
This is good.

4518
03:30:34,890 --> 03:30:36,150
He used...

4519
03:30:36,150 --> 03:30:36,450
Oh my god.

4520
03:30:41,620 --> 03:30:44,480
We didn't kill anybody, but that's okay.

4521
03:30:44,560 --> 03:30:46,700
Because we have this.

4522
03:30:48,900 --> 03:30:49,860
Okay, okay.

4523
03:30:54,760 --> 03:30:56,500
2, 1, damage, damage, damage.

4524
03:31:02,330 --> 03:31:03,770
I damaged.

4525
03:31:04,030 --> 03:31:04,610
I damaged.

4526
03:31:05,050 --> 03:31:06,030
I damaged.

4527
03:31:07,810 --> 03:31:09,190
I did my job.

4528
03:31:13,630 --> 03:31:15,410
Okay, I didn't die to...

4529
03:31:15,410 --> 03:31:16,310
I didn't...

4530
03:31:16,310 --> 03:31:19,250
Did not die to Maggle.

4531
03:31:19,910 --> 03:31:21,750
I didn't die to Maggle.

4532
03:31:22,370 --> 03:31:23,390
That was rough.

4533
03:31:23,390 --> 03:31:25,970
I think we could have actually got that push there.

4534
03:31:26,250 --> 03:31:28,910
If we did the invis ult right there.

4535
03:31:29,990 --> 03:31:31,170
That's too much overconfidence.

4536
03:31:31,610 --> 03:31:33,570
You should never be overconfident in rank.

4537
03:31:33,750 --> 03:31:34,590
Because you don't trust...

4538
03:31:34,590 --> 03:31:35,550
You can't trust anybody.

4539
03:31:35,990 --> 03:31:37,850
You can't...

4540
03:31:39,190 --> 03:31:40,810
You can't trust anybody.

4541
03:31:50,080 --> 03:31:51,080
Not even...

4542
03:31:51,080 --> 03:31:52,480
Not even my own teammates.

4543
03:32:01,120 --> 03:32:04,260
My damage boost didn't work against the Pati out there.

4544
03:32:04,660 --> 03:32:05,240
Or Choppa.

4545
03:32:05,240 --> 03:32:07,240
No, especially not me.

4546
03:32:09,180 --> 03:32:10,000
Especially not me.

4547
03:32:15,230 --> 03:32:16,650
Trust no one.

4548
03:32:22,090 --> 03:32:24,690
Even your own group.

4549
03:32:25,990 --> 03:32:26,810
You trust nobody.

4550
03:32:31,950 --> 03:32:33,210
Oh shit, no more Venom.

4551
03:32:35,450 --> 03:32:36,850
No more Venom.

4552
03:32:36,850 --> 03:32:38,070
What the fuck?

4553
03:32:38,730 --> 03:32:39,090
Why Link?

4554
03:32:39,530 --> 03:32:40,290
Why Link?

4555
03:32:40,630 --> 03:32:42,230
The cooldown is so long.

4556
03:32:42,510 --> 03:32:46,750
Oh no.

4557
03:32:47,330 --> 03:32:50,290
It's one of the longest Adam cooldowns out there.

4558
03:32:51,330 --> 03:32:52,150
I'm scared.

4559
03:33:01,400 --> 03:33:02,160
I'm scared.

4560
03:33:03,660 --> 03:33:05,720
Spin you, spin, spin, spin, spin.

4561
03:33:07,600 --> 03:33:08,300
No Link.

4562
03:33:11,280 --> 03:33:13,860
I don't know who the fuck I did it to.

4563
03:33:15,260 --> 03:33:15,700
But...

4564
03:33:15,700 --> 03:33:16,320
I did it.

4565
03:33:18,900 --> 03:33:19,340
Okay.

4566
03:33:20,820 --> 03:33:23,360
He's spinning, he's spinning, he's spinning, he's spinning, he's spinning, he's spinning.

4567
03:33:24,520 --> 03:33:25,440
Oh my god.

4568
03:33:29,420 --> 03:33:30,080
I'm healing.

4569
03:33:30,320 --> 03:33:31,180
Oh no!

4570
03:33:35,930 --> 03:33:38,710
I'll ult first, I'll ult first.

4571
03:33:39,150 --> 03:33:40,610
Oh my god.

4572
03:33:44,530 --> 03:33:45,450
I'm...

4573
03:33:45,930 --> 03:33:46,890
I'm damage boosting.

4574
03:33:49,290 --> 03:33:49,430
No!

4575
03:33:50,750 --> 03:33:51,870
Oh shit.

4576
03:33:52,230 --> 03:33:52,510
Woah!

4577
03:33:53,750 --> 03:33:54,430
Huge TP.

4578
03:33:54,990 --> 03:33:55,590
Why?

4579
03:33:56,830 --> 03:33:57,570
Choppa, why?

4580
03:34:01,690 --> 03:34:02,090
Choppa!

4581
03:34:03,610 --> 03:34:04,190
Huge TP.

4582
03:34:04,390 --> 03:34:05,210
They have Starlord ult.

4583
03:34:13,690 --> 03:34:14,350
It's okay.

4584
03:34:14,570 --> 03:34:17,010
As long as we're not on it, it should be fine, right?

4585
03:34:17,470 --> 03:34:17,890
My fault.

4586
03:34:19,610 --> 03:34:20,050
No, no.

4587
03:34:20,170 --> 03:34:21,210
I get the strength, I get the strength.

4588
03:34:22,090 --> 03:34:23,350
Oh, I can't see you Choppa.

4589
03:34:24,950 --> 03:34:25,950
We got Starlord left.

4590
03:34:26,130 --> 03:34:26,710
Hold after this.

4591
03:34:37,220 --> 03:34:37,980
He's pushing.

4592
03:34:38,160 --> 03:34:39,260
There's a mag by himself.

4593
03:34:46,980 --> 03:34:47,860
Sustain, sustain.

4594
03:34:48,040 --> 03:34:48,700
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

4595
03:34:49,020 --> 03:34:50,080
They're gonna slam it.

4596
03:34:50,140 --> 03:34:50,560
Medivh's on.

4597
03:34:50,860 --> 03:34:51,240
Okay.

4598
03:34:52,060 --> 03:34:53,920
Okay, we can walk now.

4599
03:34:58,840 --> 03:34:59,780
Come on, NB.

4600
03:35:00,340 --> 03:35:01,140
I spin, I spin.

4601
03:35:01,920 --> 03:35:02,760
NB, I'm on him.

4602
03:35:03,480 --> 03:35:03,920
Alright, alright.

4603
03:35:06,780 --> 03:35:07,420
I'm on NB.

4604
03:35:10,240 --> 03:35:11,440
Oh, no.

4605
03:35:12,340 --> 03:35:13,620
Oh, no.

4606
03:35:15,060 --> 03:35:16,760
No, I just need...

4607
03:35:16,760 --> 03:35:18,140
Oh, I was 3%.

4608
03:35:23,220 --> 03:35:24,780
Oh, 3%.

4609
03:35:28,160 --> 03:35:28,940
No.

4610
03:35:32,780 --> 03:35:33,380
Okay.

4611
03:35:34,120 --> 03:35:34,680
It's fine.

4612
03:35:39,920 --> 03:35:40,720
It's okay.

4613
03:35:41,360 --> 03:35:42,120
I froze.

4614
03:35:42,660 --> 03:35:43,640
I froze.

4615
03:35:44,220 --> 03:35:45,760
I did my job.

4616
03:35:47,320 --> 03:35:47,900
I'll up first.

4617
03:35:53,430 --> 03:35:53,990
Alright.

4618
03:35:55,870 --> 03:35:57,970
You doing it?

4619
03:35:58,970 --> 03:35:59,630
Alright.

4620
03:36:01,110 --> 03:36:02,130
Here we go.

4621
03:36:02,430 --> 03:36:04,050
Here we go.

4622
03:36:05,370 --> 03:36:06,750
Here we go.

4623
03:36:07,310 --> 03:36:09,750
3, 2, 1.

4624
03:36:17,340 --> 03:36:17,820
NB!

4625
03:36:21,000 --> 03:36:22,540
Now we walk, walk, walk.

4626
03:36:22,960 --> 03:36:23,880
NB, we're alive!

4627
03:36:27,700 --> 03:36:28,720
I don't want to jinx it.

4628
03:36:28,980 --> 03:36:29,420
We're almost...

4629
03:36:29,900 --> 03:36:30,880
We were alive.

4630
03:36:31,000 --> 03:36:32,940
Now, now we're just trying to live.

4631
03:36:33,620 --> 03:36:34,920
Now we're just...

4632
03:36:34,920 --> 03:36:35,140
Whoa!

4633
03:36:37,140 --> 03:36:38,200
I walked with you.

4634
03:36:38,300 --> 03:36:38,800
I walked with you.

4635
03:36:40,060 --> 03:36:40,540
Oh!

4636
03:36:43,160 --> 03:36:44,120
Oh, nice.

4637
03:36:44,160 --> 03:36:44,780
This is so bad.

4638
03:36:44,980 --> 03:36:46,360
I'm not scared.

4639
03:36:46,580 --> 03:36:47,200
I am scared.

4640
03:36:47,200 --> 03:36:48,440
I am scared.

4641
03:36:48,560 --> 03:36:49,500
I am scared.

4642
03:36:49,640 --> 03:36:50,380
I...

4643
03:36:50,380 --> 03:36:51,200
I...

4644
03:36:52,280 --> 03:36:53,840
I'm still scared.

4645
03:36:56,680 --> 03:36:58,340
Oh my god.

4646
03:37:01,020 --> 03:37:02,620
Oh, I'm still scared.

4647
03:37:04,960 --> 03:37:08,540
Oh, there they are.

4648
03:37:09,080 --> 03:37:09,900
Goodbye.

4649
03:37:13,780 --> 03:37:14,600
Goodbye.

4650
03:37:14,600 --> 03:37:16,740
It's okay, we got the choppa TP!

4651
03:37:21,100 --> 03:37:23,460
The choppa TP!

4652
03:37:24,660 --> 03:37:25,620
Where am I?

4653
03:37:27,340 --> 03:37:29,720
I just dropped straight down.

4654
03:37:30,860 --> 03:37:39,100
I just dropped straight down.

4655
03:37:40,340 --> 03:37:42,400
I miss choppa support.

4656
03:37:43,280 --> 03:37:46,600
I miss when he was on support, guys.

4657
03:37:49,180 --> 03:37:51,180
I miss choppa support.

4658
03:37:51,440 --> 03:37:52,580
Okay, I'll do one more.

4659
03:37:52,960 --> 03:37:54,520
I'll do one more there.

4660
03:37:55,760 --> 03:37:56,900
I'll do one more.

4661
03:37:56,980 --> 03:37:58,440
Okay, I will...

4662
03:37:58,440 --> 03:37:59,380
I'll let...

4663
03:37:59,380 --> 03:38:00,200
I'll let go.

4664
03:38:00,460 --> 03:38:03,820
Do I avoid Ubi for his crime?

4665
03:38:09,300 --> 03:38:09,940
Yes!

4666
03:38:13,780 --> 03:38:15,580
He has spoken.

4667
03:38:16,360 --> 03:38:18,400
He has spoken.

4668
03:38:25,420 --> 03:38:26,420
Alright.

4669
03:38:30,560 --> 03:38:32,680
Alright, this is last game for real.

4670
03:38:37,680 --> 03:38:39,800
He has committed crime.

4671
03:38:41,800 --> 03:38:42,760
We can't...

4672
03:38:42,760 --> 03:38:44,880
You're right, we can't leave on a loss, guys.

4673
03:38:46,900 --> 03:38:47,380
True.

4674
03:38:57,880 --> 03:38:59,160
What are we banning?

4675
03:38:59,200 --> 03:38:59,860
I'm banning Groot.

4676
03:39:03,240 --> 03:39:04,420
I'm gonna ban Groot.

4677
03:39:06,540 --> 03:39:08,400
Okay, we ban Groot and then Psylocke.

4678
03:39:08,920 --> 03:39:11,720
I'd rather deal with the Human Torch than Psylocke.

4679
03:39:14,480 --> 03:39:15,740
We ban Human Torch.

4680
03:39:16,620 --> 03:39:18,680
Yeah, he plays Human Torch.

4681
03:39:22,250 --> 03:39:24,770
Ubi, it's not the one thing...

4682
03:39:24,770 --> 03:39:27,310
It's not just the one thing wrong.

4683
03:39:27,670 --> 03:39:31,010
It's when you said to our faces that...

4684
03:39:31,770 --> 03:39:33,590
That we will be okay.

4685
03:39:40,270 --> 03:39:42,390
And that was the crime.

4686
03:39:46,770 --> 03:39:48,010
You lied!

4687
03:39:56,040 --> 03:39:57,700
That was the crime.

4688
03:40:00,680 --> 03:40:03,360
Look, Choppa can get away with it.

4689
03:40:03,460 --> 03:40:05,480
Because English is not his first language.

4690
03:40:05,780 --> 03:40:07,500
So it was a miscommunication.

4691
03:40:09,980 --> 03:40:11,880
He has the pass.

4692
03:40:13,500 --> 03:40:14,840
He's still learning.

4693
03:40:20,740 --> 03:40:22,840
The ice effects look great on stage.

4694
03:40:25,020 --> 03:40:26,860
30 seconds before you attack.

4695
03:40:27,180 --> 03:40:27,780
Get ready!

4696
03:40:37,320 --> 03:40:37,880
Also,

4697
03:40:41,120 --> 03:40:42,360
I won when Choppa lied.

4698
03:40:42,600 --> 03:40:44,180
I didn't win when Ubi lied.

4699
03:40:52,780 --> 03:40:55,940
Him lying actually is beneficial to the team.

4700
03:40:58,340 --> 03:41:01,080
Bottom, they give a tier 1 sub gift to Phantom.

4701
03:41:01,820 --> 03:41:02,400
Real.

4702
03:41:02,880 --> 03:41:03,460
Exactly.

4703
03:41:06,120 --> 03:41:08,420
Where's the rest of my team?

4704
03:41:08,880 --> 03:41:09,640
Oh, there they are.

4705
03:41:11,560 --> 03:41:12,700
Did the Human Torch again?

4706
03:41:12,780 --> 03:41:13,540
Oh my god, it is.

4707
03:41:14,140 --> 03:41:17,480
What kind of hero pool do you have?

4708
03:41:17,900 --> 03:41:19,220
That's literally...

4709
03:41:21,080 --> 03:41:21,680
Um...

4710
03:41:22,120 --> 03:41:24,220
That's literally like, uh...

4711
03:41:25,120 --> 03:41:26,580
Human Torch Psylocke.

4712
03:41:27,020 --> 03:41:29,420
Like, that is a fucking weird ass hero pool.

4713
03:41:34,660 --> 03:41:35,760
Oh my god.

4714
03:41:39,880 --> 03:41:41,280
Oh, I'm coming over.

4715
03:41:42,140 --> 03:41:44,720
Oh my gosh, I guess I'm not coming over.

4716
03:41:45,240 --> 03:41:46,120
Oh, goodbye.

4717
03:41:46,540 --> 03:41:48,600
I didn't realize the Loki ran off.

4718
03:41:49,240 --> 03:41:50,200
I was confused.

4719
03:41:50,340 --> 03:41:52,120
I was like, where did my Loki go?

4720
03:41:52,120 --> 03:41:53,880
I was so...

4721
03:41:53,880 --> 03:41:55,720
I was so confused.

4722
03:41:56,320 --> 03:41:58,720
I was like, wait, my Loki's gone.

4723
03:41:59,440 --> 03:42:00,460
I got...

4724
03:42:01,120 --> 03:42:02,540
I was so confused.

4725
03:42:03,420 --> 03:42:05,260
Like, how did he disappear?

4726
03:42:06,300 --> 03:42:08,480
He was right next to me when we were...

4727
03:42:08,480 --> 03:42:09,360
When we were fucking...

4728
03:42:10,520 --> 03:42:13,120
Dealing with that Venom and then he left me?

4729
03:42:15,280 --> 03:42:16,480
That should've been a hit.

4730
03:42:18,040 --> 03:42:20,240
That absolutely should've been a kill.

4731
03:42:22,200 --> 03:42:24,000
That should've been a hit on the freeze.

4732
03:42:24,100 --> 03:42:25,060
I don't know how that didn't hit.

4733
03:42:25,860 --> 03:42:28,020
I'm getting shot from the back.

4734
03:42:28,840 --> 03:42:31,520
There is a Human Torch behind us for sure.

4735
03:42:35,210 --> 03:42:36,370
Yeah, there he is.

4736
03:42:37,710 --> 03:42:38,650
Oh, Mag is ulted.

4737
03:42:40,430 --> 03:42:40,970
Then hello.

4738
03:42:43,370 --> 03:42:44,670
And Mag no ult.

4739
03:42:45,130 --> 03:42:45,550
Okay.

4740
03:42:46,350 --> 03:42:46,830
Nice.

4741
03:42:50,230 --> 03:42:50,750
Alright.

4742
03:42:51,290 --> 03:42:52,330
We should be okay.

4743
03:42:52,330 --> 03:42:53,310
For now.

4744
03:42:53,470 --> 03:42:54,290
I shouldn't jinx this.

4745
03:42:54,450 --> 03:42:55,330
But like...

4746
03:42:56,490 --> 03:42:58,350
At this moment of time, I am okay.

4747
03:42:58,870 --> 03:42:59,910
That's how I'm gonna say it.

4748
03:42:59,930 --> 03:43:01,030
At this moment of time.

4749
03:43:05,880 --> 03:43:06,720
Jesus Christ.

4750
03:43:08,740 --> 03:43:09,260
Jesus.

4751
03:43:10,440 --> 03:43:11,500
Yeah, fuck that one guy.

4752
03:43:11,940 --> 03:43:13,120
Oh my god.

4753
03:43:13,260 --> 03:43:14,400
Fuck me, I guess too.

4754
03:43:15,580 --> 03:43:16,100
Wow.

4755
03:43:17,240 --> 03:43:19,340
Let's run through this fight.

4756
03:43:21,220 --> 03:43:22,120
Okay, nice.

4757
03:43:27,250 --> 03:43:28,420
Jesus Christ, Chopper.

4758
03:43:29,200 --> 03:43:30,360
Oh my god.

4759
03:43:32,330 --> 03:43:33,000
Where's Mag?

4760
03:43:35,400 --> 03:43:36,300
Where's Mag?

4761
03:43:36,340 --> 03:43:36,820
Oh, wait!

4762
03:43:39,160 --> 03:43:39,860
Wait.

4763
03:43:40,980 --> 03:43:42,040
Guru's on our team.

4764
03:43:42,240 --> 03:43:43,140
Which one is Gale?

4765
03:43:44,700 --> 03:43:45,600
Frozen Venom?

4766
03:43:48,200 --> 03:43:48,940
Nice.

4767
03:43:51,500 --> 03:43:52,920
I just noticed.

4768
03:43:56,600 --> 03:43:56,940
Oh!

4769
03:43:58,120 --> 03:43:58,820
No!

4770
03:44:00,500 --> 03:44:01,440
I'm alive.

4771
03:44:03,320 --> 03:44:03,680
Oh.

4772
03:44:04,740 --> 03:44:06,180
Oh, I'm sorry.

4773
03:44:06,600 --> 03:44:07,820
I'm sorry!

4774
03:44:10,320 --> 03:44:11,960
I was not fine.

4775
03:44:12,580 --> 03:44:13,580
Wait, I am fine.

4776
03:44:14,560 --> 03:44:14,940
I got three.

4777
03:44:15,200 --> 03:44:15,720
I got three of them.

4778
03:44:16,200 --> 03:44:16,840
No supports.

4779
03:44:19,330 --> 03:44:20,560
I'm coming back.

4780
03:44:22,880 --> 03:44:23,580
Oh!

4781
03:44:26,720 --> 03:44:27,940
Supports are here now.

4782
03:44:28,880 --> 03:44:29,500
He didn't look at me?

4783
03:44:29,820 --> 03:44:30,220
Or copy?

4784
03:44:31,160 --> 03:44:31,740
Oh my god.

4785
03:44:34,160 --> 03:44:35,740
Are you okay?

4786
03:44:42,000 --> 03:44:42,640
Nice.

4787
03:44:49,400 --> 03:44:50,540
Wait, Loki low!

4788
03:44:54,480 --> 03:44:55,120
Nice.

4789
03:44:55,680 --> 03:44:56,740
We did it.

4790
03:44:56,740 --> 03:44:58,800
Oh, so Guru's just...

4791
03:44:58,800 --> 03:45:00,220
Guru's solo queue right now.

4792
03:45:00,980 --> 03:45:01,260
Nice.

4793
03:45:02,620 --> 03:45:02,900
Yay!

4794
03:45:04,460 --> 03:45:05,480
Oh my god!

4795
03:45:05,480 --> 03:45:05,780
Okay.

4796
03:45:06,280 --> 03:45:10,300
That would've been so cool if I hit that.

4797
03:45:10,680 --> 03:45:12,700
Guys, I wish I...

4798
03:45:12,700 --> 03:45:15,860
I think if I didn't get Ricocheted, I would've hit it.

4799
03:45:16,260 --> 03:45:21,740
I think I would've...

4800
03:45:22,360 --> 03:45:25,300
I think if I didn't bounce up, I could've hit it.

4801
03:45:28,160 --> 03:45:29,160
Doki Bird.

4802
03:45:29,320 --> 03:45:29,780
Doki Bird.

4803
03:45:29,800 --> 03:45:30,620
Yes, I'm Doki Bird.

4804
03:45:30,780 --> 03:45:31,700
Doki Bird.

4805
03:45:35,260 --> 03:45:37,200
What is Doki Bird?

4806
03:45:38,720 --> 03:45:41,240
Do you know Doki Bird fans 69?

4807
03:45:41,840 --> 03:45:43,100
That's Hulus.

4808
03:45:51,960 --> 03:45:56,300
I don't know who Doki Bird fans 69 is.

4809
03:45:57,120 --> 03:45:58,380
Google it.

4810
03:45:58,700 --> 03:46:00,100
I should be...

4811
03:46:00,100 --> 03:46:00,760
I am...

4812
03:46:01,320 --> 03:46:03,060
I'm not Doki Bird.

4813
03:46:04,240 --> 03:46:06,120
I am Donkey Kong.

4814
03:46:11,760 --> 03:46:13,800
You guys should Google.

4815
03:46:15,700 --> 03:46:18,340
Yeah, he's the number one rapper in Japan.

4816
03:46:26,740 --> 03:46:27,480
Yes, 100.

4817
03:46:33,800 --> 03:46:35,660
The potty monkey?

4818
03:46:37,400 --> 03:46:38,460
Oh my god.

4819
03:46:41,060 --> 03:46:41,360
What?

4820
03:46:42,860 --> 03:46:43,800
You're crazy.

4821
03:46:53,870 --> 03:46:55,650
That wolf's looking for an ult.

4822
03:46:59,410 --> 03:47:01,510
The wolf has no passive.

4823
03:47:04,050 --> 03:47:05,750
1, 2, 3.

4824
03:47:05,830 --> 03:47:06,250
Go, go, go.

4825
03:47:06,270 --> 03:47:06,570
Go, go, go.

4826
03:47:06,610 --> 03:47:07,150
I'm already dead.

4827
03:47:09,090 --> 03:47:09,530
Okay.

4828
03:47:13,230 --> 03:47:14,170
Oh my god.

4829
03:47:14,790 --> 03:47:16,190
I lost track of where he was.

4830
03:47:16,290 --> 03:47:17,750
Don't tell him I did not do it.

4831
03:47:20,490 --> 03:47:21,810
Don't tell him I missed.

4832
03:47:23,230 --> 03:47:24,270
He doesn't know.

4833
03:47:29,740 --> 03:47:30,880
That wolf ult here.

4834
03:47:34,580 --> 03:47:35,100
What?

4835
03:47:48,480 --> 03:47:49,000
More,

4836
03:47:57,700 --> 03:47:58,140
go, go.

4837
03:47:58,280 --> 03:47:59,080
Go to your spawn.

4838
03:48:00,880 --> 03:48:01,940
Wait.

4839
03:48:02,440 --> 03:48:03,460
Back out, T9.

4840
03:48:06,620 --> 03:48:08,020
What the...

4841
03:48:09,600 --> 03:48:11,400
He's gone.

4842
03:48:14,800 --> 03:48:18,100
Are you guys okay?

4843
03:48:23,180 --> 03:48:25,980
Oh yeah.

4844
03:48:30,880 --> 03:48:31,000
What?

4845
03:48:33,100 --> 03:48:36,380
He did not want that back pass.

4846
03:48:37,660 --> 03:48:39,860
He did not want it.

4847
03:48:41,080 --> 03:48:41,860
Understandable.

4848
03:48:42,780 --> 03:48:43,560
Okay.

4849
03:48:49,180 --> 03:48:52,440
Okay, let's let the Navel Guru, let's let him go.

4850
03:48:55,020 --> 03:48:56,320
Are you okay?

4851
03:48:56,940 --> 03:48:57,200
Kappa?

4852
03:48:57,920 --> 03:48:59,200
He's not okay.

4853
03:49:10,720 --> 03:49:13,840
Oh my god, he lived.

4854
03:49:14,460 --> 03:49:15,260
I froze Venom.

4855
03:49:20,690 --> 03:49:22,070
Hello to the right.

4856
03:49:27,070 --> 03:49:32,450
Oh, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

4857
03:49:35,870 --> 03:49:37,610
Damage boosting, damage boosting.

4858
03:49:39,530 --> 03:49:40,010
Go.

4859
03:49:40,110 --> 03:49:42,750
Yo, you, oh my god, oh my god.

4860
03:49:43,170 --> 03:49:44,770
Who is on the thing right now?

4861
03:49:49,210 --> 03:49:50,790
Go, go, go.

4862
03:49:52,770 --> 03:49:54,090
Invis is coming over.

4863
03:49:55,470 --> 03:49:55,970
One more.

4864
03:49:55,990 --> 03:50:00,530
Who's on the thing right now?

4865
03:50:03,810 --> 03:50:05,570
I spawn capped, I spawn capped, I spawn capped.

4866
03:50:05,910 --> 03:50:06,390
Go!

4867
03:50:06,390 --> 03:50:09,530
Go, go, go, go.

4868
03:50:14,410 --> 03:50:15,690
Maglo, Maglo too.

4869
03:50:20,620 --> 03:50:22,920
Oh my god, they're all low.

4870
03:50:29,040 --> 03:50:30,680
I can't see you, oh.

4871
03:50:31,160 --> 03:50:31,540
Okay.

4872
03:50:35,300 --> 03:50:35,740
Guys,

4873
03:50:39,830 --> 03:50:41,130
I don't have ult here.

4874
03:50:43,450 --> 03:50:44,950
Choco, why can't you do that?

4875
03:50:51,350 --> 03:50:52,050
Can win.

4876
03:50:52,550 --> 03:50:53,750
Can win, can win, can win.

4877
03:50:54,170 --> 03:50:54,810
Can win, can win.

4878
03:50:57,130 --> 03:50:57,570
Guys.

4879
03:51:03,350 --> 03:51:06,430
Bro, I literally damage boost Trump every time.

4880
03:51:09,970 --> 03:51:10,570
Guys,

4881
03:51:17,110 --> 03:51:18,310
I don't think the thing was it.

4882
03:51:18,770 --> 03:51:19,770
I don't know.

4883
03:51:28,380 --> 03:51:31,740
I think we definitely did better when we're not on the thing.

4884
03:51:31,740 --> 03:51:39,680
I think, I think, I think we actually were doing better without being on the thing.

4885
03:51:41,940 --> 03:51:43,120
Why are you touching me?

4886
03:51:45,960 --> 03:51:46,100
What?

4887
03:51:47,680 --> 03:51:49,760
He wants to throw me and you're not touching me.

4888
03:51:52,420 --> 03:51:54,880
Everything changed when he swapped to the thing.

4889
03:51:56,240 --> 03:51:59,400
I think he was definitely a better, he was what?

4890
03:52:00,600 --> 03:52:02,700
He was a better mag player.

4891
03:52:02,880 --> 03:52:03,640
Was he a mag, right?

4892
03:52:03,720 --> 03:52:04,900
He was a better mag player.

4893
03:52:22,440 --> 03:52:22,840
Nice.

4894
03:52:24,040 --> 03:52:24,660
Hello, hello.

4895
03:52:25,040 --> 03:52:25,520
Hello, hello.

4896
03:52:30,660 --> 03:52:32,040
Oh my god, he couldn't Q.

4897
03:52:33,480 --> 03:52:36,160
I did, I pressed ult, but it didn't go off.

4898
03:52:40,580 --> 03:52:42,800
I went, I pressed Q, it didn't go off.

4899
03:52:48,860 --> 03:52:50,380
I didn't actually got pinged there.

4900
03:52:51,040 --> 03:52:55,400
That actually went off on my, I pressed Q.

4901
03:52:58,540 --> 03:53:00,100
Yeah, I don't know why it didn't go off.

4902
03:53:00,140 --> 03:53:02,160
I pressed Q for it too, I spammed it.

4903
03:53:04,560 --> 03:53:05,260
Oh no.

4904
03:53:06,280 --> 03:53:07,140
I tried my best.

4905
03:53:11,290 --> 03:53:12,930
Oh my god.

4906
03:53:13,330 --> 03:53:15,010
I spammed Q.

4907
03:53:18,730 --> 03:53:19,850
Okay.

4908
03:53:27,930 --> 03:53:30,650
Oh my god.

4909
03:53:30,850 --> 03:53:33,850
No, I got combo'd.

4910
03:53:34,890 --> 03:53:37,010
Come on, we died, we lost a good time.

4911
03:53:37,850 --> 03:53:39,990
I got combo'd, what do you want from me?

4912
03:53:47,710 --> 03:53:51,870
We, I am not the problem here.

4913
03:53:51,950 --> 03:53:54,990
When we went mag, we were doing really well.

4914
03:54:00,710 --> 03:54:02,650
The thing, our thing is not like the best player.

4915
03:54:04,770 --> 03:54:05,830
He should be playing...

4916
03:54:13,040 --> 03:54:15,040
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

4917
03:54:15,300 --> 03:54:15,740
Okay.

4918
03:54:16,950 --> 03:54:17,800
There we go.

4919
03:54:21,970 --> 03:54:22,420
Oh!

4920
03:54:23,400 --> 03:54:28,040
Oh my god.

4921
03:54:29,560 --> 03:54:30,500
I literally...

4922
03:54:31,960 --> 03:54:34,520
I freeze him every time.

4923
03:54:35,460 --> 03:54:37,100
I've always frozen him.

4924
03:54:49,680 --> 03:54:50,960
Oh no!

4925
03:54:54,640 --> 03:54:55,620
That's fucked.

4926
03:54:56,500 --> 03:54:58,300
I don't know why we went the thing.

4927
03:55:05,600 --> 03:55:06,860
I don't know why.

4928
03:55:07,480 --> 03:55:09,200
I feel like we should've swapped.

4929
03:55:09,520 --> 03:55:13,140
We should've swapped the thing to... we should've stayed...

4930
03:55:14,480 --> 03:55:15,120
Mag.

4931
03:55:15,480 --> 03:55:17,420
He was doing so well on mag.

4932
03:55:21,750 --> 03:55:23,770
Literally, we couldn't do anything with it.

4933
03:55:25,870 --> 03:55:26,430
Oh!

4934
03:55:27,510 --> 03:55:29,250
And then I got blamed.

4935
03:55:29,350 --> 03:55:31,050
I was like, I pressed Q.

4936
03:55:32,630 --> 03:55:33,770
Oh, it doesn't crash.

4937
03:55:33,870 --> 03:55:34,130
Oh!

4938
03:55:34,490 --> 03:55:35,510
They fixed it.

4939
03:55:36,610 --> 03:55:37,630
They fixed it.

4940
03:55:37,730 --> 03:55:40,830
I don't know why he stayed on the thing.

4941
03:55:41,110 --> 03:55:42,950
He was literally doing so much on mag.

4942
03:55:44,790 --> 03:55:47,690
He was not getting, he was not getting picked up.

4943
03:55:48,890 --> 03:55:53,630
If he... okay, why the fuck is he playing on NA if he hates NA players?

4944
03:55:55,830 --> 03:56:00,450
Yeah, but he wasn't getting killed as mag when they were Wolverine.

4945
03:56:02,590 --> 03:56:05,370
And then I got blamed when they comboed me.

4946
03:56:05,750 --> 03:56:10,230
I was like, what do... I can't live when they venom Luna.

4947
03:56:13,810 --> 03:56:16,170
They're like, Luna, why you die?

4948
03:56:16,170 --> 03:56:19,970
I was like, I don't know, they venom Luna damage boosted me.

4949
03:56:20,270 --> 03:56:22,170
Like, what do I do?

4950
03:56:24,970 --> 03:56:29,850
We couldn't venom, we didn't venom Luna damage, but they did.

4951
03:56:34,120 --> 03:56:37,200
Yeah, why would you, if you hate NA so much, don't Q in our region.

4952
03:56:37,980 --> 03:56:39,880
Don't, stop playing EU.

4953
03:56:43,440 --> 03:56:45,820
Can you ult for the overseer to survive that?

4954
03:56:45,820 --> 03:56:55,060
I don't, I could've, yeah, I could've ulted it, but like, I didn't, I couldn't, the thing is with two Luna ults, I didn't realize they, we did, they were doing the venom.

4955
03:56:56,320 --> 03:56:59,580
They were, I didn't realize they were doing the venom damage boost as well.

4956
03:57:01,260 --> 03:57:03,380
But like, there was no reason for me to use it.

4957
03:57:03,580 --> 03:57:06,900
At that time, I didn't think I had to use it because I wanted to save my Luna ult.

4958
03:57:08,140 --> 03:57:11,580
I wanted to save it until like, it was like, emergency type deal.

4959
03:57:18,570 --> 03:57:20,450
I definitely got pinged hard though.

4960
03:57:21,330 --> 03:57:30,370
I should not have, uh, that time when I tried to ult, that first, the third point, we trolled, second point we fucking trolled so much.

4961
03:57:31,390 --> 03:57:33,730
I don't know why we were trolling second point.

4962
03:57:35,950 --> 03:57:39,190
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna end on a loss.

4963
03:57:45,810 --> 03:57:47,430
Uh, I'm banning Groot.

4964
03:57:48,610 --> 03:57:50,830
I don't wanna end on a loss, guys.

4965
03:57:59,410 --> 03:58:01,590
I've only been streaming for four hours.

4966
03:58:02,950 --> 03:58:04,830
Not, technically not that long.

4967
03:58:05,870 --> 03:58:07,490
They have the Psylocke one trick again.

4968
03:58:08,190 --> 03:58:09,290
Is it always him?

4969
03:58:10,310 --> 03:58:14,250
Wait, how do you recognize me?

4970
03:58:14,910 --> 03:58:15,390
Oh my god.

4971
03:58:15,390 --> 03:58:16,070
I don't know my voice, nevermind.

4972
03:58:17,070 --> 03:58:17,690
I fucking talked.

4973
03:58:17,710 --> 03:58:18,290
Wiggsie, I'm Wiggsie.

4974
03:58:18,970 --> 03:58:19,990
Oh, is that Wiggsie?

4975
03:58:20,090 --> 03:58:20,250
Oh.

4976
03:58:23,590 --> 03:58:25,030
Um, it's total hours.

4977
03:58:25,190 --> 03:58:26,890
I have a set amount of hours.

4978
03:58:27,070 --> 03:58:30,070
I need a, I need a stream per month.

4979
03:58:30,110 --> 03:58:33,090
And I have, I, there's, I need a, there's a lot.

4980
03:58:34,370 --> 03:58:37,130
Cause I did not stream enough of it.

4981
03:58:37,350 --> 03:58:40,290
I got the partnership late compared to everybody.

4982
03:58:53,810 --> 03:58:55,070
Let's see, ooh.

4983
03:58:55,210 --> 03:58:56,910
Why is there so many Venom players on at this time?

4984
03:58:57,130 --> 03:58:57,190
Why?

4985
03:58:57,410 --> 03:59:01,010
Got my, got my thumbnails for the day.

4986
03:59:01,030 --> 03:59:02,070
This week, yay.

4987
03:59:04,790 --> 03:59:05,990
What's wrong with Venom, man?

4988
03:59:06,790 --> 03:59:07,490
So boring.

4989
03:59:09,110 --> 03:59:11,230
But I like playing Venom, don't you think?

4990
03:59:13,370 --> 03:59:15,530
I'm still upset that my Q didn't go off.

4991
03:59:15,710 --> 03:59:17,650
Did the animation go off on my screen?

4992
03:59:17,770 --> 03:59:19,210
I knew I was spamming it.

4993
03:59:19,290 --> 03:59:20,630
I was spamming the Q button.

4994
03:59:20,910 --> 03:59:22,790
But it didn't go off for some reason.

4995
03:59:22,790 --> 03:59:22,830
Oh man.

4996
03:59:29,580 --> 03:59:33,740
I was too, like, bothered by the fact that I, my thing didn't go.

4997
03:59:35,900 --> 03:59:37,260
Oh, put it on moving.

4998
03:59:40,420 --> 03:59:42,440
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

4999
03:59:42,980 --> 03:59:45,800
Okay, maybe he's a better thing player.

5000
03:59:50,940 --> 03:59:52,460
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

5001
03:59:58,580 --> 04:00:01,480
Sorry, Venom, very sad.

5002
04:00:04,640 --> 04:00:05,740
Can't move.

5003
04:00:16,960 --> 04:00:17,520
Okay.

5004
04:00:19,580 --> 04:00:22,500
Oh my god, there were so many clones, I missed it!

5005
04:00:26,020 --> 04:00:27,400
There were so many clones.

5006
04:00:27,840 --> 04:00:29,680
I couldn't see where the Venom went.

5007
04:00:31,060 --> 04:00:37,020
I actually, I lost, I lost track.

5008
04:00:46,070 --> 04:00:49,430
So many damage!

5009
04:00:53,030 --> 04:00:54,680
Jesus Christ.

5010
04:00:59,140 --> 04:01:03,970
Alright, I'm on, I'm stalling for, I'm stalling for.

5011
04:01:05,290 --> 04:01:05,810
Okay.

5012
04:01:06,990 --> 04:01:08,690
3, 2, 1.

5013
04:01:10,510 --> 04:01:11,630
Oh, they double ulted.

5014
04:01:21,020 --> 04:01:22,800
Jesus Christ, what's going on?

5015
04:01:25,340 --> 04:01:26,740
What's going on?

5016
04:01:27,640 --> 04:01:28,280
I froze him.

5017
04:01:29,660 --> 04:01:30,560
Wait, I'm here, I'm here, I'm in front of you.

5018
04:01:34,780 --> 04:01:35,660
Okay, nice.

5019
04:01:36,200 --> 04:01:38,060
Okay, not nice, not nice.

5020
04:01:39,980 --> 04:01:42,060
I was like, nevermind!

5021
04:01:47,000 --> 04:01:50,140
That was not, did not feel good.

5022
04:01:52,720 --> 04:01:53,220
Alright.

5023
04:01:54,760 --> 04:01:58,840
I'm already halfway to my, woah, I'm already halfway to another, that's crazy.

5024
04:02:01,800 --> 04:02:03,020
That's actually crazy.

5025
04:02:06,690 --> 04:02:08,430
Oh, I thought he was going to go right side.

5026
04:02:10,330 --> 04:02:18,950
That's what I hate about trying to freeze Venom players sometimes, because it's like 20% is trying to predict where he's going to go, and sometimes I don't know where he's going to go.

5027
04:02:20,750 --> 04:02:21,830
Is that huge?

5028
04:02:22,690 --> 04:02:23,350
He was!

5029
04:02:24,530 --> 04:02:25,570
Yeah, I saw like nothing there.

5030
04:02:25,890 --> 04:02:27,090
I didn't see anything.

5031
04:02:32,530 --> 04:02:35,730
No, no, no, I meant their, woah.

5032
04:02:39,090 --> 04:02:39,990
No, no, no.

5033
04:02:55,670 --> 04:02:58,330
That was, yeah, I don't know what you guys are talking about, you did nothing unstrange.

5034
04:03:02,190 --> 04:03:03,330
I don't know what you guys are talking about.

5035
04:03:04,790 --> 04:03:08,270
I think I'm just, if I win this, I think I'm down.

5036
04:03:10,110 --> 04:03:12,470
Choppa, we only win when you're on support, Choppa.

5037
04:03:16,370 --> 04:03:17,610
I think Choppa.

5038
04:03:17,670 --> 04:03:19,830
Choppa should be my Mercy, my Mercy pocket.

5039
04:03:21,610 --> 04:03:23,150
He's number one Mercy player.

5040
04:03:35,890 --> 04:03:38,090
GP, man, no play except play.

5041
04:03:39,390 --> 04:03:40,910
Choppa, you don't want to be my Mercy main?

5042
04:03:42,110 --> 04:03:42,630
Man.

5043
04:03:45,690 --> 04:03:47,630
Hop on, hop on, hop on.

5044
04:03:48,870 --> 04:03:52,010
Oh yeah, here we go, here we go, hold on, hold on, hold on.

5045
04:03:53,410 --> 04:03:53,770
Woah!

5046
04:03:54,690 --> 04:03:55,730
Choppa, Choppa, heal.

5047
04:03:56,290 --> 04:03:56,730
What is this?

5048
04:03:57,570 --> 04:03:58,930
I like stood still.

5049
04:04:02,530 --> 04:04:02,890
Oh,

5050
04:04:08,140 --> 04:04:08,140
man.

5051
04:04:16,520 --> 04:04:17,300
Okay, okay, okay.

5052
04:04:25,810 --> 04:04:26,410
Oh.

5053
04:04:27,430 --> 04:04:29,190
He did the damage boost.

5054
04:04:30,650 --> 04:04:32,010
Why can't Choppa do that?

5055
04:04:40,330 --> 04:04:43,730
Why can't Choppa do that when he's on Venom, guys?

5056
04:04:47,430 --> 04:04:48,070
Oh, shit!

5057
04:04:48,790 --> 04:04:49,930
Sorry, I was looking at chat.

5058
04:04:52,810 --> 04:04:53,350
My bad.

5059
04:04:53,350 --> 04:04:55,190
I should stop looking at chat.

5060
04:04:56,930 --> 04:04:58,270
JK, I would never stop.

5061
04:04:58,390 --> 04:04:58,670
Oh!

5062
04:05:03,610 --> 04:05:04,290
Oh.

5063
04:05:08,590 --> 04:05:09,270
Okay.

5064
04:05:11,950 --> 04:05:13,470
I'm just going to move back.

5065
04:05:13,910 --> 04:05:15,710
Three, two, one.

5066
04:05:17,810 --> 04:05:18,350
Oh, no.

5067
04:05:20,770 --> 04:05:21,130
Nice.

5068
04:05:23,110 --> 04:05:24,290
Move, move, go back.

5069
04:05:24,430 --> 04:05:25,110
Come on, hold on, hold on.

5070
04:05:25,170 --> 04:05:25,590
I have an idea.

5071
04:05:26,150 --> 04:05:27,430
Are they worried here now?

5072
04:05:28,370 --> 04:05:28,990
What's your idea?

5073
04:05:29,090 --> 04:05:29,510
What's your idea?

5074
04:05:29,710 --> 04:05:30,310
Come back.

5075
04:05:30,410 --> 04:05:31,030
Go back, Choppa.

5076
04:05:31,910 --> 04:05:33,330
They don't have a world coming?

5077
04:05:34,530 --> 04:05:34,830
Oh, yeah.

5078
04:05:34,950 --> 04:05:35,410
A whole world.

5079
04:05:36,850 --> 04:05:37,210
Thanks.

5080
04:05:37,930 --> 04:05:38,290
Sorry.

5081
04:05:38,850 --> 04:05:39,830
You're too far.

5082
04:05:40,410 --> 04:05:41,230
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

5083
04:05:46,990 --> 04:05:48,270
I like the cold.

5084
04:05:49,550 --> 04:05:50,510
Wait, where...

5085
04:05:50,510 --> 04:05:51,930
Where is this portal?

5086
04:05:53,110 --> 04:05:53,890
It's on the high ground.

5087
04:05:54,730 --> 04:05:55,670
What, you don't see it?

5088
04:05:55,930 --> 04:05:56,710
No, I didn't!

5089
04:05:57,010 --> 04:05:57,690
It worked, though.

5090
04:06:01,510 --> 04:06:01,990
Okay.

5091
04:06:03,330 --> 04:06:04,270
Okay, it worked.

5092
04:06:06,630 --> 04:06:07,150
Yeah, see?

5093
04:06:07,230 --> 04:06:07,610
It worked, though.

5094
04:06:08,210 --> 04:06:08,690
What?

5095
04:06:08,870 --> 04:06:09,770
High ground?

5096
04:06:09,990 --> 04:06:10,890
I looked down.

5097
04:06:10,990 --> 04:06:12,510
I was like, where am I?

5098
04:06:15,470 --> 04:06:17,750
I can't believe you crashed into my TP.

5099
04:06:20,170 --> 04:06:20,890
Bro, that...

5100
04:06:20,890 --> 04:06:22,210
That was a pretty bad TP.

5101
04:06:24,390 --> 04:06:28,290
I don't even know how we won that fight.

5102
04:06:32,920 --> 04:06:34,020
Come here, come here, come here.

5103
04:06:34,080 --> 04:06:35,160
I press ult, I press ult.

5104
04:06:37,120 --> 04:06:38,020
I'm with you, I'll cover mine.

5105
04:06:41,800 --> 04:06:42,640
They're on left side.

5106
04:06:42,760 --> 04:06:43,820
Left side, hello, hello, left side.

5107
04:06:49,240 --> 04:06:50,440
Chase, help me point, help me point.

5108
04:06:50,540 --> 04:06:51,320
I'm trying, I'm reloading.

5109
04:06:56,960 --> 04:06:57,640
Where are you?

5110
04:06:59,980 --> 04:07:00,540
Oh, there you are.

5111
04:07:02,340 --> 04:07:02,980
That guy...

5112
04:07:02,980 --> 04:07:03,920
I'm chasing him.

5113
04:07:04,240 --> 04:07:05,460
You got this, I believe in you.

5114
04:07:05,640 --> 04:07:06,200
Shut him off.

5115
04:07:10,120 --> 04:07:11,240
Wait, we're stalling him, right?

5116
04:07:11,240 --> 04:07:11,920
Go, go, go!

5117
04:07:13,040 --> 04:07:13,400
Drop it!

5118
04:07:13,400 --> 04:07:14,140
Oh, man.

5119
04:07:17,680 --> 04:07:19,700
Yeah, we're staggering him.

5120
04:07:19,900 --> 04:07:20,760
You go first, you go first.

5121
04:07:20,880 --> 04:07:21,620
Yeah, I'll go first.

5122
04:07:21,860 --> 04:07:22,640
Luna first, Luna.

5123
04:07:23,420 --> 04:07:25,020
We're gonna try to do the combo again.

5124
04:07:29,860 --> 04:07:30,660
I'm using

5125
04:07:35,770 --> 04:07:37,690
it.

5126
04:07:39,090 --> 04:07:40,170
Where are you, Venom?

5127
04:07:46,530 --> 04:07:48,150
Oh, you went all the way there?

5128
04:07:48,510 --> 04:07:49,790
What the heck?

5129
04:08:10,940 --> 04:08:12,640
Oh, my God, where's my Luna?

5130
04:08:15,160 --> 04:08:15,520
I'm

5131
04:08:21,970 --> 04:08:22,330
like...

5132
04:08:22,750 --> 04:08:24,050
Oh, my God!

5133
04:08:27,640 --> 04:08:28,880
Okay, we might need a TP.

5134
04:08:35,560 --> 04:08:36,380
Also, I got a kill.

5135
04:08:40,320 --> 04:08:41,200
I can touch, maybe.

5136
04:08:42,520 --> 04:08:44,180
Wait, I can TP, what am I talking about?

5137
04:08:44,840 --> 04:08:44,920
Oh!

5138
04:08:49,580 --> 04:08:50,360
Wait,

5139
04:08:55,590 --> 04:08:58,470
where are we?

5140
04:08:59,770 --> 04:09:00,710
Oh, my God.

5141
04:09:04,390 --> 04:09:06,710
I can't see anything!

5142
04:09:09,770 --> 04:09:10,550
Okay.

5143
04:09:12,310 --> 04:09:15,710
I think Gomez is gonna get off of TP duty.

5144
04:09:19,210 --> 04:09:21,210
I need to TP!

5145
04:09:23,190 --> 04:09:25,110
I need to TP!

5146
04:09:29,730 --> 04:09:30,850
I can't!

5147
04:09:31,510 --> 04:09:33,530
Could I go back to...

5148
04:09:33,990 --> 04:09:35,610
Could I go back to DPS?

5149
04:09:35,990 --> 04:09:37,630
It could be kind of fun.

5150
04:09:38,030 --> 04:09:38,810
A little bit of fun.

5151
04:09:39,530 --> 04:09:41,470
He's not thinking with portals right now.

5152
04:09:42,370 --> 04:09:43,070
He's not.

5153
04:09:43,070 --> 04:09:44,070
You wanna have me on tank?

5154
04:09:44,710 --> 04:09:45,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5155
04:09:47,170 --> 04:09:49,070
Yeah, that sounds okay.

5156
04:09:49,210 --> 04:09:49,790
Let's do that fuck.

5157
04:09:50,550 --> 04:09:51,090
Thank God.

5158
04:09:52,230 --> 04:09:53,930
After that last TP, I don't...

5159
04:09:53,930 --> 04:09:55,690
I don't trust their strange anymore.

5160
04:09:56,330 --> 04:09:57,030
Why would he be?

5161
04:09:57,110 --> 04:09:57,890
The last two.

5162
04:09:58,090 --> 04:09:59,170
The last two, true.

5163
04:09:59,270 --> 04:10:01,310
The last two were pretty...

5164
04:10:01,310 --> 04:10:02,130
pretty weird.

5165
04:10:02,390 --> 04:10:03,270
There's no way.

5166
04:10:03,370 --> 04:10:04,650
There's no way you guys think it was my fault.

5167
04:10:05,170 --> 04:10:05,930
There's no way.

5168
04:10:06,710 --> 04:10:07,250
I mean...

5169
04:10:07,250 --> 04:10:09,130
It's not your fault.

5170
04:10:09,590 --> 04:10:11,510
You might not be a strange player.

5171
04:10:15,230 --> 04:10:15,930
You might not be a strange player, that's for sure.

5172
04:10:16,510 --> 04:10:18,390
But maybe not Dr. Strange.

5173
04:10:19,650 --> 04:10:21,810
Yeah, he definitely did not get his doctorate.

5174
04:10:22,890 --> 04:10:24,230
He called me a strange player.

5175
04:10:24,670 --> 04:10:25,550
I was an intern.

5176
04:10:28,130 --> 04:10:28,610
Goddamnit.

5177
04:10:42,650 --> 04:10:43,610
Free point.

5178
04:10:47,270 --> 04:10:47,570
Free point.

5179
04:10:57,270 --> 04:10:59,210
I don't think it's free anymore.

5180
04:11:03,840 --> 04:11:04,960
Oh, no.

5181
04:11:08,820 --> 04:11:10,540
I wish my Bucky did that.

5182
04:11:10,980 --> 04:11:12,960
I don't have a Bucky.

5183
04:11:22,360 --> 04:11:24,480
Oh, if I bully you, it makes me look less bad.

5184
04:11:27,120 --> 04:11:28,300
Oh, I just held tab.

5185
04:11:28,360 --> 04:11:28,840
I see why.

5186
04:11:30,980 --> 04:11:31,880
Sorry about that.

5187
04:11:34,160 --> 04:11:35,260
I'll go first.

5188
04:11:43,670 --> 04:11:44,350
I'm the ulti.

5189
04:11:47,170 --> 04:11:49,090
Oh, I might be dead to this.

5190
04:11:50,190 --> 04:11:51,070
Oh, nevermind.

5191
04:11:51,730 --> 04:11:52,690
I'm alive!

5192
04:12:01,770 --> 04:12:02,190
Okay.

5193
04:12:05,830 --> 04:12:07,150
Oh, this is so boring.

5194
04:12:07,210 --> 04:12:07,850
This is Venom.

5195
04:12:07,930 --> 04:12:08,850
This is Venom, man.

5196
04:12:09,230 --> 04:12:10,330
What a boring character.

5197
04:12:11,510 --> 04:12:11,850
God.

5198
04:12:20,570 --> 04:12:20,990
Guys...

5199
04:12:20,990 --> 04:12:22,510
Guys, I don't...

5200
04:12:22,510 --> 04:12:24,730
Guys, I don't know if I can win anymore.

5201
04:12:25,610 --> 04:12:27,730
Guys, I'm losing more and more hope.

5202
04:12:27,730 --> 04:12:29,250
I'm...

5203
04:12:31,670 --> 04:12:32,230
I'm...

5204
04:12:32,230 --> 04:12:34,730
I'm losing...

5205
04:12:34,730 --> 04:12:37,430
more and more hope right now.

5206
04:12:38,850 --> 04:12:39,950
I don't want.

5207
04:12:46,340 --> 04:12:47,660
I'm losing

5208
04:12:51,340 --> 04:13:01,320
more and more hope, guys.

5209
04:13:01,700 --> 04:13:03,780
I'm losing...

5210
04:13:09,480 --> 04:13:10,080
Guys...

5211
04:13:10,080 --> 04:13:11,660
I'm a little scared now.

5212
04:13:21,330 --> 04:13:23,290
Yeah, I'm not standing here anymore.

5213
04:13:28,090 --> 04:13:31,170
I'm a little scared standing up here, but okay.

5214
04:13:38,000 --> 04:13:38,980
I go first.

5215
04:13:48,660 --> 04:13:50,040
Can I help?

5216
04:13:51,360 --> 04:13:52,140
Can I help?

5217
04:13:52,300 --> 04:13:52,440
Can I help?

5218
04:13:53,440 --> 04:13:55,300
I don't know what you were saying.

5219
04:14:01,880 --> 04:14:04,040
I'm ulting.

5220
04:14:10,860 --> 04:14:11,940
Oh...

5221
04:14:13,600 --> 04:14:14,680
Oh...

5222
04:14:14,680 --> 04:14:16,660
3, 2, 1...

5223
04:14:17,780 --> 04:14:18,180
No!

5224
04:14:18,180 --> 04:14:18,300
No!

5225
04:14:26,680 --> 04:14:28,360
Wait, we have portal, right?

5226
04:14:28,620 --> 04:14:28,980
Or no?

5227
04:14:30,280 --> 04:14:30,720
No.

5228
04:14:31,380 --> 04:14:32,040
Okay.

5229
04:14:43,920 --> 04:14:45,680
I believe.

5230
04:14:47,040 --> 04:14:47,640
No!

5231
04:14:49,000 --> 04:14:49,440
No!

5232
04:14:50,620 --> 04:14:51,980
Alright, we're banning Venom.

5233
04:14:53,040 --> 04:14:54,820
No more of this Venom bullshit.

5234
04:14:54,980 --> 04:14:56,040
That character is so...

5235
04:14:58,180 --> 04:14:58,700
God.

5236
04:14:59,680 --> 04:15:01,320
Why can't Gomez do that?

5237
04:15:01,440 --> 04:15:02,100
I know, right?

5238
04:15:02,600 --> 04:15:04,640
Guys, we're getting on a loss, guys.

5239
04:15:05,340 --> 04:15:06,720
We're getting on a loss.

5240
04:15:10,630 --> 04:15:13,850
Getting on a loss is... Guys, that's not us, guys.

5241
04:15:15,850 --> 04:15:17,850
I can get it all back.

5242
04:15:18,110 --> 04:15:18,730
It's fine.

5243
04:15:19,510 --> 04:15:21,370
We still have a streak, yeah?

5244
04:15:21,430 --> 04:15:22,710
We don't talk about it.

5245
04:15:22,710 --> 04:15:26,250
We don't... Technically, we don't talk about it, guys.

5246
04:15:26,410 --> 04:15:31,130
We don't talk about the loss streak.

5247
04:15:34,250 --> 04:15:35,270
It's okay.

5248
04:15:37,630 --> 04:15:38,630
It's okay.

5249
04:15:38,850 --> 04:15:39,710
Things are gonna...

5250
04:15:40,270 --> 04:15:45,570
Things will be... Now that we banned Venom, things will be better now, guys.

5251
04:15:47,890 --> 04:15:51,930
Now that we know what to ban, we will be fine.

5252
04:15:52,710 --> 04:15:54,330
We will be fine.

5253
04:15:57,030 --> 04:15:58,130
Fine, you're right.

5254
04:15:58,270 --> 04:15:59,170
I need my... What's this?

5255
04:15:59,210 --> 04:16:00,190
Saratoga water?

5256
04:16:00,510 --> 04:16:01,670
To refresh myself.

5257
04:16:04,310 --> 04:16:06,010
We don't talk about it.

5258
04:16:06,230 --> 04:16:07,850
It gets better, guys.

5259
04:16:08,030 --> 04:16:09,250
It always gets better.

5260
04:16:09,890 --> 04:16:12,550
It always gets better.

5261
04:16:23,600 --> 04:16:24,680
It's okay.

5262
04:16:32,430 --> 04:16:33,490
We're learning.

5263
04:16:47,880 --> 04:16:48,400
Oh?

5264
04:16:49,940 --> 04:16:52,280
Oh, I thought they changed something.

5265
04:16:56,010 --> 04:16:56,950
Guys, it's okay.

5266
04:16:57,070 --> 04:16:59,230
I can always get... I can always climb back.

5267
04:16:59,750 --> 04:17:01,330
I can always climb back.

5268
04:17:02,110 --> 04:17:03,350
I have 16 days.

5269
04:17:03,450 --> 04:17:03,890
It's okay.

5270
04:17:04,010 --> 04:17:05,710
I have 16 days to always come back up.

5271
04:17:06,770 --> 04:17:07,390
It's fine.

5272
04:17:08,330 --> 04:17:09,330
Things will be okay.

5273
04:17:10,430 --> 04:17:11,650
Things will be okay.

5274
04:17:37,970 --> 04:17:38,770
You're right.

5275
04:17:39,650 --> 04:17:40,650
You're right, guys.

5276
04:17:42,130 --> 04:17:43,770
It's not Chapa's fault.

5277
04:17:55,060 --> 04:17:55,860
It's okay.

5278
04:17:56,000 --> 04:17:57,520
The longer I stream...

5279
04:17:57,520 --> 04:18:01,240
The longer I stream, the more I'm fitting the quota of my hours.

5280
04:18:01,460 --> 04:18:02,460
That's all that matters.

5281
04:18:06,590 --> 04:18:09,550
The longer I stream, the more hours I get.

5282
04:18:10,450 --> 04:18:11,890
And that's what we're here for.

5283
04:18:11,970 --> 04:18:13,270
We're just here for the hours.

5284
04:18:28,860 --> 04:18:29,920
You're right, though.

5285
04:18:30,160 --> 04:18:33,620
Why couldn't my Bucky do what their Bucky did?

5286
04:18:38,920 --> 04:18:40,200
No, it's fine.

5287
04:18:40,360 --> 04:18:41,040
It's fine.

5288
04:18:41,200 --> 04:18:42,120
It's just...

5289
04:18:42,120 --> 04:18:45,720
If we win one more game, we're only down two games, guys.

5290
04:18:46,620 --> 04:18:50,980
We just need to win one more game, and we're just down two games.

5291
04:18:55,280 --> 04:18:56,400
Also, like...

5292
04:18:56,400 --> 04:18:57,980
Those pointers were pretty...

5293
04:18:57,980 --> 04:19:02,380
Okay, the high ground portal...

5294
04:19:02,380 --> 04:19:05,240
The high ground portal was very...

5295
04:19:05,240 --> 04:19:06,760
Was definitely interesting.

5296
04:19:17,380 --> 04:19:18,240
Oh, you're right.

5297
04:19:18,300 --> 04:19:19,680
If we win four games, we're up.

5298
04:19:19,900 --> 04:19:20,660
You're so right.

5299
04:19:20,700 --> 04:19:22,600
We're up a game if we win four games.

5300
04:19:24,120 --> 04:19:25,540
You're so right, guys.

5301
04:19:26,320 --> 04:19:27,380
You're so right.

5302
04:19:27,960 --> 04:19:29,280
No, maybe three games.

5303
04:19:29,400 --> 04:19:29,900
Maybe...

5304
04:19:29,900 --> 04:19:31,660
I think we can win three games, guys.

5305
04:19:32,160 --> 04:19:33,640
I think that's possible.

5306
04:19:34,680 --> 04:19:37,500
And if we win five, we'll be up two games.

5307
04:19:37,600 --> 04:19:38,540
You're so right, guys.

5308
04:19:38,940 --> 04:19:40,420
Thank God I don't have a stream tomorrow.

5309
04:19:42,800 --> 04:19:44,980
My doctor was like, you gotta rest your throat.

5310
04:19:45,760 --> 04:19:46,120
Wait.

5311
04:19:46,520 --> 04:19:47,360
You wanna get better?

5312
04:19:49,560 --> 04:19:50,260
Oh, shit.

5313
04:19:50,360 --> 04:19:51,080
It's 4-0-2.

5314
04:19:51,480 --> 04:19:53,140
Okay, if we win this, I'm calling it.

5315
04:19:53,880 --> 04:19:56,080
If we win the next game, I'm actually calling it.

5316
04:19:59,450 --> 04:20:00,650
Jokey, I need to sleep?

5317
04:20:01,030 --> 04:20:04,610
If I don't need to sleep, you'll be fine.

5318
04:20:04,610 --> 04:20:06,790
Okay, actually, if you guys need to sleep, go sleep.

5319
04:20:08,850 --> 04:20:11,830
If you guys need to sleep, go sleep, guys.

5320
04:20:14,630 --> 04:20:16,170
Neko, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

5321
04:20:16,290 --> 04:20:16,950
Thank you, thank you.

5322
04:20:16,990 --> 04:20:18,690
Warrior, thank you for the 20 bits.

5323
04:20:18,790 --> 04:20:19,970
Thank you, thank you.

5324
04:20:20,550 --> 04:20:25,970
Phantom, thank you for gifting a Tier 1 sub to Gomez and Ube.

5325
04:20:26,510 --> 04:20:28,950
Wait, Gomez was never... Oh my God, fake fan.

5326
04:20:30,990 --> 04:20:33,150
Delta, thank you for gifting a Tier 1 sub.

5327
04:20:33,150 --> 04:20:35,830
And Phantom, thank you for gifting five Tier 1 subs.

5328
04:20:35,910 --> 04:20:36,990
Thank you, thank you.

5329
04:20:40,920 --> 04:20:43,420
This is why Choppa's my favorite.

5330
04:20:45,120 --> 04:20:46,480
I don't even think he streams.

5331
04:20:46,820 --> 04:20:50,440
But he doesn't pretend to be a...

5332
04:20:50,440 --> 04:20:53,340
He doesn't pretend to be a dragon, at least.

5333
04:21:01,950 --> 04:21:03,010
That's fucking right.

5334
04:21:03,350 --> 04:21:04,070
I said it.

5335
04:21:04,890 --> 04:21:05,950
Yeah, I said it.

5336
04:21:07,150 --> 04:21:09,590
I'm gonna do a match to pass the time.

5337
04:21:11,450 --> 04:21:13,030
Oh, Choppa's... Oh, I should not.

5338
04:21:13,230 --> 04:21:14,090
Nevermind, I just remembered.

5339
04:21:16,850 --> 04:21:22,670
Nevermind, I did not mean that.

5340
04:21:23,050 --> 04:21:24,550
I just remembered all...

5341
04:21:24,550 --> 04:21:27,130
I just remembered the stuff he said.

5342
04:21:27,830 --> 04:21:28,730
Guys, I don't mean that.

5343
04:21:28,790 --> 04:21:29,710
Wait, I can't go up here?

5344
04:21:29,790 --> 04:21:30,750
What's the point of a staircase?

5345
04:21:34,150 --> 04:21:34,810
Wait, what?

5346
04:21:35,650 --> 04:21:36,570
Are they not here to fight?

5347
04:21:36,810 --> 04:21:37,830
What's the point of doing matches?

5348
04:21:38,930 --> 04:21:39,630
What?

5349
04:21:40,430 --> 04:21:41,570
Are we just chilling?

5350
04:21:42,470 --> 04:21:43,610
Oh, shit.

5351
04:21:44,580 --> 04:21:47,350
I didn't know this was a chill circle!

5352
04:21:51,950 --> 04:21:53,830
Oh my god.

5353
04:21:54,070 --> 04:21:56,150
I didn't know we were supposed to be chilling.

5354
04:21:59,690 --> 04:22:01,130
This is a chill circle?

5355
04:22:01,810 --> 04:22:03,270
Look, I was... I misunderstood.

5356
04:22:04,550 --> 04:22:05,370
I misunderstood.

5357
04:22:08,170 --> 04:22:09,150
This sucks.

5358
04:22:09,810 --> 04:22:11,470
This is a chill Doom Patrol.

5359
04:22:12,510 --> 04:22:13,670
This is a...

5360
04:22:14,330 --> 04:22:15,290
It's not?

5361
04:22:18,550 --> 04:22:19,670
Oh my god.

5362
04:22:19,710 --> 04:22:21,310
What the fuck happened to me?

5363
04:22:24,590 --> 04:22:26,090
Oh my god.

5364
04:22:27,430 --> 04:22:27,750
Hello.

5365
04:22:29,510 --> 04:22:30,650
Wait, are we all fighting now?

5366
04:22:31,690 --> 04:22:33,010
What's going on?

5367
04:22:34,790 --> 04:22:35,910
Are we not chill?

5368
04:22:36,110 --> 04:22:37,250
We ain't chill like that.

5369
04:22:37,690 --> 04:22:40,010
Is this what Doom is like?

5370
04:22:40,190 --> 04:22:40,910
Doom Q like?

5371
04:22:42,770 --> 04:22:44,790
There's no one... No one wants to fight?

5372
04:22:48,150 --> 04:22:50,530
Is that what it's like in these queues?

5373
04:22:51,930 --> 04:22:54,130
Okay, but what if like... Okay.

5374
04:22:55,490 --> 04:22:57,330
What if I just start a war?

5375
04:23:08,640 --> 04:23:09,740
Oh, nice.

5376
04:23:10,520 --> 04:23:11,640
Reminded me to start a war.

5377
04:23:12,100 --> 04:23:14,380
The Loki started a war.

5378
04:23:15,940 --> 04:23:17,360
What have I just caused?

5379
04:23:17,460 --> 04:23:18,940
Oh my god.

5380
04:23:19,560 --> 04:23:21,260
We're in the trenches.

5381
04:23:22,440 --> 04:23:24,340
We're in the trenches.

5382
04:23:27,360 --> 04:23:28,040
Celestia!

5383
04:23:33,280 --> 04:23:36,460
We're actually in the trenches now.

5384
04:23:38,540 --> 04:23:40,760
Oh my god.

5385
04:23:45,180 --> 04:23:45,560
Wait, what?

5386
04:23:45,680 --> 04:23:46,120
What's up?

5387
04:23:48,720 --> 04:23:50,020
We're down here.

5388
04:23:50,180 --> 04:23:52,520
I'm gonna play... What's his name?

5389
04:23:53,980 --> 04:23:54,480
Wocket.

5390
04:23:54,640 --> 04:23:55,380
I'm gonna play Wocket.

5391
04:23:56,340 --> 04:23:56,980
What?!

5392
04:23:56,980 --> 04:23:58,380
I'm gonna play Punisher for me.

5393
04:24:00,740 --> 04:24:01,380
Okay.

5394
04:24:02,760 --> 04:24:04,260
I'm banning Venom.

5395
04:24:04,520 --> 04:24:05,480
Fuck this shit.

5396
04:24:08,840 --> 04:24:11,220
I'm fucking...

5397
04:24:11,220 --> 04:24:16,800
Spider-Man?!

5398
04:24:16,800 --> 04:24:18,780
Bro, just ban Venom.

5399
04:24:23,200 --> 04:24:23,900
Yeah.

5400
04:24:28,460 --> 04:24:29,860
Okay.

5401
04:24:33,920 --> 04:24:36,040
Did he just say Wocket?

5402
04:24:38,900 --> 04:24:40,420
Did he just say Wocket?

5403
04:24:46,060 --> 04:24:49,960
Who are the... Who are the Celestia players?

5404
04:24:50,360 --> 04:24:53,260
Who are the Celestia players in this lobby?

5405
04:25:03,600 --> 04:25:05,200
I need a note.

5406
04:25:05,860 --> 04:25:06,760
I need a note.

5407
04:25:06,800 --> 04:25:07,400
No, they banned.

5408
04:25:14,820 --> 04:25:17,380
I'm too... I'm too... Oh, dude.

5409
04:25:17,780 --> 04:25:23,880
I need a note.

5410
04:25:27,040 --> 04:25:28,880
What the fuck?

5411
04:25:30,360 --> 04:25:34,360
I need a note.

5412
04:25:34,820 --> 04:25:37,380
I think the Rocket is one of them.

5413
04:25:40,700 --> 04:25:41,180
Don't worry.

5414
04:25:41,260 --> 04:25:42,280
You don't need to hear me speak.

5415
04:25:42,380 --> 04:25:43,560
I'm just gonna hear what you're gonna give me.

5416
04:25:43,740 --> 04:25:44,320
I don't know what I'm saying.

5417
04:25:47,180 --> 04:25:51,140
These are the types of freaks you encounter in Celestia.

5418
04:25:55,640 --> 04:25:56,220
My Evo.

5419
04:25:59,340 --> 04:25:59,920
My Evo.

5420
04:26:00,820 --> 04:26:01,800
I thought he was like Wocket.

5421
04:26:02,860 --> 04:26:03,020
What?

5422
04:26:03,220 --> 04:26:04,620
I hear...

5423
04:26:04,620 --> 04:26:05,920
He broke my... He's inside.

5424
04:26:06,100 --> 04:26:06,760
He broke my thing.

5425
04:26:06,760 --> 04:26:10,140
Is he like Ubu topping in my lobby?

5426
04:26:10,580 --> 04:26:11,700
There's Namor behind us.

5427
04:26:13,900 --> 04:26:14,500
Namor.

5428
04:26:14,540 --> 04:26:14,940
Namor behind.

5429
04:26:16,440 --> 04:26:18,340
There's a lot of people behind us, unfortunately.

5430
04:26:23,680 --> 04:26:25,380
You guys heal each other.

5431
04:26:25,480 --> 04:26:26,140
I'll heal the other...

5432
04:26:26,140 --> 04:26:27,160
What the fuck?

5433
04:26:27,700 --> 04:26:30,140
I can't... I can't think.

5434
04:26:31,000 --> 04:26:31,340
I'm dead.

5435
04:26:31,660 --> 04:26:33,080
Yeah, you're redlining.

5436
04:26:38,770 --> 04:26:39,470
Watch out.

5437
04:26:39,650 --> 04:26:44,330
Oh my god.

5438
04:26:45,530 --> 04:26:47,270
We did not ban Venom.

5439
04:26:47,770 --> 04:26:53,330
I wish... Yeah, we did not ban... I mean, we could...

5440
04:26:53,330 --> 04:26:55,250
Oh my god, please.

5441
04:27:01,080 --> 04:27:03,680
I'm cringing a... No, I am too, guys.

5442
04:27:03,740 --> 04:27:04,920
You're so crazy, I guess.

5443
04:27:05,380 --> 04:27:07,120
I am cringing a little too.

5444
04:27:07,360 --> 04:27:08,100
This is so fucked.

5445
04:27:08,640 --> 04:27:10,360
I don't think you should play Punisher.

5446
04:27:10,620 --> 04:27:12,240
Yeah, I was just thinking that.

5447
04:27:12,760 --> 04:27:13,540
Yeah, I'm on my Bucky.

5448
04:27:14,960 --> 04:27:16,520
Bucky is good, still.

5449
04:27:18,700 --> 04:27:20,100
Come on, it's just...

5450
04:27:21,280 --> 04:27:23,380
Bro, he's doing ult attacks!

5451
04:27:23,800 --> 04:27:25,660
This is too early for ult.

5452
04:27:25,840 --> 04:27:28,160
This is too late at night for ult, doc.

5453
04:27:30,500 --> 04:27:32,500
This is way too late.

5454
04:27:35,340 --> 04:27:37,060
I guess I have to push a little.

5455
04:27:42,940 --> 04:27:43,740
We should...

5456
04:27:43,740 --> 04:27:45,080
I don't think he's doing a bit.

5457
04:27:45,160 --> 04:27:46,280
There's no way.

5458
04:27:46,960 --> 04:27:48,040
Do people... Wait.

5459
04:27:48,420 --> 04:27:50,000
Isn't, like, a lifestyle?

5460
04:27:51,240 --> 04:27:53,300
Do people talk like that as a lifestyle?

5461
04:27:56,020 --> 04:27:59,220
Like, I don't know.

5462
04:27:59,280 --> 04:27:59,840
How about the girls?

5463
04:28:00,040 --> 04:28:03,640
When the guy goes on you girls, heal each other and I'll heal both of y'all, okay?

5464
04:28:04,760 --> 04:28:05,920
Then miss you all first.

5465
04:28:09,920 --> 04:28:10,880
See it?

5466
04:28:11,780 --> 04:28:13,180
Yo, yo, yo, infinite assassin.

5467
04:28:13,880 --> 04:28:14,360
Nice.

5468
04:28:15,440 --> 04:28:15,920
Nice.

5469
04:28:18,620 --> 04:28:19,580
He's like...

5470
04:28:20,040 --> 04:28:20,960
I'm just curious!

5471
04:28:21,240 --> 04:28:22,180
Is it a lifestyle?

5472
04:28:23,340 --> 04:28:24,640
Or, like, what?

5473
04:28:25,920 --> 04:28:26,860
I don't know!

5474
04:28:27,000 --> 04:28:27,800
That was so delightful.

5475
04:28:31,480 --> 04:28:34,700
How many Magnetos are alive after not getting healed for, like, 5 minutes?

5476
04:28:34,720 --> 04:28:35,360
Might be?

5477
04:28:37,000 --> 04:28:38,680
I'm so confused.

5478
04:28:39,540 --> 04:28:42,840
I thought he was doing that, like, out of cringe.

5479
04:28:43,100 --> 04:28:43,460
He's off the shark.

5480
04:28:43,580 --> 04:28:44,340
He's not doing that anymore.

5481
04:28:44,480 --> 04:28:44,840
Watch out.

5482
04:28:50,840 --> 04:28:51,300
Whoa.

5483
04:28:52,520 --> 04:28:52,980
Unfortunate.

5484
04:28:53,760 --> 04:28:55,020
Oh, that's unfortunate.

5485
04:28:55,400 --> 04:28:56,160
I'm just gonna fight on point.

5486
04:28:56,780 --> 04:28:57,180
Push up.

5487
04:29:03,120 --> 04:29:04,640
3, 2, 1.

5488
04:29:07,980 --> 04:29:09,160
Need more on high ground.

5489
04:29:09,240 --> 04:29:10,000
Need more on high ground.

5490
04:29:10,820 --> 04:29:11,740
Yeah, I know.

5491
04:29:19,590 --> 04:29:20,550
Where's our GPS?

5492
04:29:20,810 --> 04:29:21,510
Oh, there he is.

5493
04:29:22,590 --> 04:29:23,050
Oh.

5494
04:29:23,050 --> 04:29:24,050
Oh, he fucked up.

5495
04:29:27,010 --> 04:29:28,470
There's a fucking guy behind us.

5496
04:29:29,770 --> 04:29:30,650
That'll be 5.

5497
04:29:33,310 --> 04:29:33,550
Oh.

5498
04:29:34,410 --> 04:29:35,170
Bucky behind.

5499
04:29:35,290 --> 04:29:35,790
Bucky's behind.

5500
04:29:37,470 --> 04:29:38,730
It's not Bucky that's behind.

5501
04:29:38,890 --> 04:29:39,630
It's fucking Irelia.

5502
04:29:40,710 --> 04:29:42,970
Oh my god.

5503
04:29:45,430 --> 04:29:46,970
Bucky was behind.

5504
04:29:47,090 --> 04:29:47,930
What do you mean?

5505
04:29:48,210 --> 04:29:51,250
He was considered behind our Magneto.

5506
04:29:54,070 --> 04:29:57,130
You're not the only person playing.

5507
04:29:58,670 --> 04:29:59,430
Stop it.

5508
04:29:59,630 --> 04:30:00,290
What the fuck?

5509
04:30:00,370 --> 04:30:01,790
He just broke my beacon instantly.

5510
04:30:02,390 --> 04:30:03,570
That would kill me.

5511
04:30:03,930 --> 04:30:05,330
This fucking Irapace is killing me.

5512
04:30:05,410 --> 04:30:06,410
Does anybody play Game Boy?

5513
04:30:07,450 --> 04:30:08,670
Oh my god.

5514
04:30:09,470 --> 04:30:10,450
What am I?

5515
04:30:10,910 --> 04:30:14,370
Oh my god, I got pushed.

5516
04:30:19,530 --> 04:30:20,410
Where's the ult?

5517
04:30:21,070 --> 04:30:21,550
Oh no.

5518
04:30:22,530 --> 04:30:24,190
Oh, that's where the ult was.

5519
04:30:25,150 --> 04:30:27,970
Fuck guys, I think I'm gonna go Namor.

5520
04:30:29,750 --> 04:30:31,630
Does he even play Namor?

5521
04:30:33,770 --> 04:30:34,490
Does he?

5522
04:30:34,490 --> 04:30:37,910
I could do a serviceable job probably.

5523
04:30:39,210 --> 04:30:39,850
I mean, shit.

5524
04:30:40,950 --> 04:30:42,390
Does that voice deprave people?

5525
04:30:42,650 --> 04:30:46,110
But like, I didn't realize some people actually talk like that.

5526
04:30:46,330 --> 04:30:47,690
I thought it was just done ironically.

5527
04:30:55,360 --> 04:30:55,700
Where is he?

5528
04:30:58,060 --> 04:30:58,620
Okay.

5529
04:31:01,380 --> 04:31:01,900
That's fine.

5530
04:31:02,680 --> 04:31:03,160
Oh, nice.

5531
04:31:04,140 --> 04:31:05,400
Oh, not nice!

5532
04:31:06,600 --> 04:31:07,160
Nice.

5533
04:31:08,180 --> 04:31:09,540
Give me some healing, okay?

5534
04:31:09,740 --> 04:31:10,460
Thank you.

5535
04:31:11,460 --> 04:31:12,100
Alright.

5536
04:31:13,000 --> 04:31:14,060
Okay, we're fine.

5537
04:31:16,980 --> 04:31:17,920
We're okay.

5538
04:31:23,880 --> 04:31:24,320
Okay.

5539
04:31:25,460 --> 04:31:28,900
The- Oh my gosh, because we banned Venom, we let Namor through.

5540
04:31:29,460 --> 04:31:32,800
Which is also pretty fucking not great.

5541
04:31:37,400 --> 04:31:38,680
It's pretty...

5542
04:31:38,680 --> 04:31:39,280
Can you damage boost?

5543
04:31:42,160 --> 04:31:42,600
Okay.

5544
04:31:44,900 --> 04:31:45,340
Nice.

5545
04:31:45,800 --> 04:31:46,980
Oh my god, we did it.

5546
04:31:48,000 --> 04:31:49,540
That- What a fucking hero pull.

5547
04:31:50,300 --> 04:31:51,800
Okay, that's a little bit too much ult.

5548
04:32:04,400 --> 04:32:07,680
Oh my god, what a fucking weird ass hero pull though.

5549
04:32:08,540 --> 04:32:09,420
Rocket Namor.

5550
04:32:10,720 --> 04:32:14,840
I- I've never seen a Rocket Namor hero pull before.

5551
04:32:15,780 --> 04:32:17,080
That's why I was like, damn.

5552
04:32:18,860 --> 04:32:19,340
You got him.

5553
04:32:22,460 --> 04:32:23,800
I got you, I got you.

5554
04:32:24,780 --> 04:32:25,120
Just one.

5555
04:32:27,300 --> 04:32:27,720
Alright.

5556
04:32:29,460 --> 04:32:33,540
Namor- Yeah, Namor is like one of the easiest DPS out there.

5557
04:32:34,320 --> 04:32:34,960
That's meta.

5558
04:32:35,380 --> 04:32:36,340
I should be specific.

5559
04:32:36,780 --> 04:32:38,680
Oh my god, I'm missing all my freezers on him.

5560
04:32:38,680 --> 04:32:40,380
Did not see it.

5561
04:32:41,720 --> 04:32:42,540
Oh no.

5562
04:32:46,720 --> 04:32:48,080
Oh, he has strange ult.

5563
04:32:48,220 --> 04:32:50,180
Oh my- What?!

5564
04:32:50,180 --> 04:32:51,160
What the fuck?

5565
04:32:52,920 --> 04:32:55,240
What was the de- Oh, it's E.

5566
04:32:55,620 --> 04:32:57,740
He timed- Oh my god.

5567
04:32:57,840 --> 04:32:59,140
He timed it with the E.

5568
04:32:59,920 --> 04:33:01,040
He did it with the E.

5569
04:33:01,200 --> 04:33:02,360
He slammed and stranged you at the same time.

5570
04:33:02,680 --> 04:33:03,020
Yeah.

5571
04:33:03,860 --> 04:33:07,420
If you do it with ult and E, it's like, really strong.

5572
04:33:10,220 --> 04:33:10,940
That's crazy.

5573
04:33:11,220 --> 04:33:16,100
That's a- That's a- I don't even know if that was intentional.

5574
04:33:16,260 --> 04:33:16,940
That's a thing.

5575
04:33:18,720 --> 04:33:20,500
I can't tell if that was intentional or not.

5576
04:33:22,600 --> 04:33:23,980
Or like, it was an accident.

5577
04:33:25,880 --> 04:33:27,040
Oh nice, he got hooked.

5578
04:33:27,680 --> 04:33:28,240
Good guy.

5579
04:33:31,980 --> 04:33:32,800
Oh, I don't have ult.

5580
04:33:39,460 --> 04:33:40,820
Just have it.

5581
04:33:41,060 --> 04:33:41,440
Nice!

5582
04:33:42,240 --> 04:33:43,100
Nice!

5583
04:33:48,560 --> 04:33:49,420
Nice!

5584
04:33:49,560 --> 04:33:49,920
Again!

5585
04:33:51,820 --> 04:33:52,220
Again!

5586
04:33:54,980 --> 04:33:55,840
Yippee!

5587
04:33:59,740 --> 04:34:01,060
We did it!

5588
04:34:06,820 --> 04:34:07,720
We did it!

5589
04:34:07,720 --> 04:34:09,680
This is what 4am queues are like.

5590
04:34:10,280 --> 04:34:11,860
I've hit- I've hit that time.

5591
04:34:14,980 --> 04:34:18,520
I've hit the- I've hit the time.

5592
04:34:23,050 --> 04:34:27,610
I've finally bumped into people that speak UwU talk, but like, seriously.

5593
04:34:30,830 --> 04:34:31,830
Not ironically.

5594
04:34:49,430 --> 04:34:50,030
Oh!

5595
04:34:50,050 --> 04:34:50,110
What?

5596
04:34:51,550 --> 04:34:54,990
What is- What the fuck?

5597
04:34:56,550 --> 04:34:58,530
What is going on?

5598
04:34:58,630 --> 04:35:03,890
I don't even know what- It's right on my keyboard.

5599
04:35:06,030 --> 04:35:07,050
Look, look.

5600
04:35:07,150 --> 04:35:08,090
Choppa, Choppa.

5601
04:35:08,770 --> 04:35:09,150
Venom.

5602
04:35:09,470 --> 04:35:09,890
Venom.

5603
04:35:13,210 --> 04:35:13,970
Oh!

5604
04:35:14,630 --> 04:35:18,530
Oh my god.

5605
04:35:18,830 --> 04:35:19,350
My keyboard.

5606
04:35:21,690 --> 04:35:24,530
My keyboard wasn't working.

5607
04:35:25,210 --> 04:35:30,530
I was so scared.

5608
04:35:31,150 --> 04:35:33,770
I was trying to get out of the keyboard.

5609
04:35:34,490 --> 04:35:35,550
Oh my- everything.

5610
04:35:36,470 --> 04:35:37,590
Oh my god.

5611
04:35:38,310 --> 04:35:38,830
Anymore behind?

5612
04:35:42,330 --> 04:35:46,510
Oh my god.

5613
04:35:47,950 --> 04:35:49,330
I'll cart push.

5614
04:35:49,510 --> 04:35:50,510
I am cart bitch.

5615
04:35:55,690 --> 04:35:57,230
I am cart bitch.

5616
04:36:01,210 --> 04:36:01,910
Oh!

5617
04:36:03,630 --> 04:36:04,130
Oh!

5618
04:36:05,330 --> 04:36:07,410
What's going on with my keyboard?

5619
04:36:09,290 --> 04:36:12,170
Guys, there's nothing to worry about when I say that.

5620
04:36:12,750 --> 04:36:13,570
TP, TP.

5621
04:36:21,080 --> 04:36:22,160
I need heals.

5622
04:36:31,860 --> 04:36:32,380
Nice.

5623
04:36:32,640 --> 04:36:33,020
Got one.

5624
04:36:35,520 --> 04:36:37,020
Where are people at?

5625
04:36:37,400 --> 04:36:41,200
I can't tell.

5626
04:36:41,400 --> 04:36:42,160
Strange, strange, strange one.

5627
04:36:42,260 --> 04:36:42,660
Strange one.

5628
04:36:43,260 --> 04:36:43,860
Strange dead.

5629
04:36:45,120 --> 04:36:46,180
Dead, dead, dead, dead.

5630
04:36:46,440 --> 04:36:46,780
Nice.

5631
04:36:47,860 --> 04:36:48,860
You're ready to damage boost.

5632
04:36:48,920 --> 04:36:49,340
Oh!

5633
04:36:51,860 --> 04:36:52,380
Okay.

5634
04:36:52,820 --> 04:36:55,240
Make sure they're fucking my Nidalee.

5635
04:36:57,800 --> 04:36:59,920
There's a Neymar up here.

5636
04:37:06,180 --> 04:37:07,400
That's hella up there now.

5637
04:37:10,200 --> 04:37:11,800
What do you mean?!

5638
04:37:12,620 --> 04:37:14,400
I know my bare feet!

5639
04:37:15,200 --> 04:37:17,620
Guys, I know that sounded wrong the moment I said that out loud.

5640
04:37:22,550 --> 04:37:24,860
I know what it sounds like.

5641
04:37:26,720 --> 04:37:28,380
You ult first, Siv.

5642
04:37:34,880 --> 04:37:38,980
I'll ult first, I'll ult first.

5643
04:37:39,400 --> 04:37:40,220
Got him.

5644
04:37:42,700 --> 04:37:44,480
That's literally his sound!

5645
04:37:45,300 --> 04:37:47,780
That's how it sounds like when he walks!

5646
04:37:47,880 --> 04:37:49,500
It's the bare feet sound!

5647
04:37:49,680 --> 04:37:50,860
Okay, nope, nevermind, shit.

5648
04:37:52,040 --> 04:37:54,820
Okay, since our Neymar's dead, you can ult now, Siv.

5649
04:37:54,880 --> 04:37:55,400
Whatever.

5650
04:38:17,200 --> 04:38:17,820
Awkward.

5651
04:38:19,640 --> 04:38:20,260
Awkward!

5652
04:38:20,720 --> 04:38:22,440
Are you serious?!

5653
04:38:25,600 --> 04:38:27,820
Oh, where are people at?

5654
04:38:32,090 --> 04:38:32,710
Okay.

5655
04:38:34,110 --> 04:38:34,850
Awkward.

5656
04:38:36,030 --> 04:38:36,770
Awkward.

5657
04:38:39,330 --> 04:38:40,970
I'm scared of this champ.

5658
04:38:42,530 --> 04:38:42,970
He's up there.

5659
04:38:48,280 --> 04:38:49,520
Oh my god, please.

5660
04:38:52,260 --> 04:38:54,880
Okay, we got one person.

5661
04:38:55,700 --> 04:38:57,040
We got our only tank.

5662
04:38:57,420 --> 04:38:59,600
We got our only tank!

5663
04:39:01,360 --> 04:39:02,380
That's fine.

5664
04:39:04,600 --> 04:39:05,900
We have no tank.

5665
04:39:06,380 --> 04:39:08,560
I like the cold.

5666
04:39:11,870 --> 04:39:13,010
There's someone up top.

5667
04:39:13,710 --> 04:39:15,770
Triforce behind us, Triforce behind us.

5668
04:39:29,530 --> 04:39:30,890
I froze him, I froze him!

5669
04:39:31,010 --> 04:39:31,850
Oh, I'm dead.

5670
04:39:32,750 --> 04:39:33,530
I got him.

5671
04:39:33,670 --> 04:39:34,830
Wow, fucking hell, nice.

5672
04:39:36,890 --> 04:39:39,310
I'm just switching to this, this is not gonna, I wouldn't switch.

5673
04:39:41,210 --> 04:39:43,130
I have to get this.

5674
04:39:43,710 --> 04:39:44,830
He has no Flicker, man.

5675
04:39:57,630 --> 04:39:58,930
Oh my god.

5676
04:40:02,010 --> 04:40:04,790
Okay, well at least that got, he got that out of the way.

5677
04:40:05,330 --> 04:40:05,710
Okay.

5678
04:40:06,550 --> 04:40:07,210
That's awkward.

5679
04:40:07,690 --> 04:40:08,370
I froze him.

5680
04:40:11,190 --> 04:40:12,230
Oh no!

5681
04:40:13,430 --> 04:40:13,930
That's fine.

5682
04:40:15,150 --> 04:40:17,230
I couldn't, I would heal out of it.

5683
04:40:18,370 --> 04:40:20,230
I thought I could outheal it.

5684
04:40:23,750 --> 04:40:24,930
Bye, gold moon.

5685
04:40:25,110 --> 04:40:25,650
I don't know what to do.

5686
04:40:26,710 --> 04:40:28,490
Whatever, let me try something new.

5687
04:40:30,870 --> 04:40:32,490
Let me double tank something.

5688
04:40:34,030 --> 04:40:36,370
Let me try something new.

5689
04:40:38,230 --> 04:40:38,970
Just one.

5690
04:40:39,750 --> 04:40:40,070
Okay.

5691
04:40:45,670 --> 04:40:45,990
Alright.

5692
04:40:49,350 --> 04:40:51,310
Oh, that would have been a good freeze.

5693
04:40:52,030 --> 04:40:52,810
Wait, Maglo, Maglo!

5694
04:40:53,870 --> 04:40:54,650
He's dead, he's dead.

5695
04:40:54,830 --> 04:40:55,230
Let's go, let's go.

5696
04:40:55,350 --> 04:40:56,750
Captain Miracle-O, Captain Miracle-O.

5697
04:40:57,470 --> 04:40:59,950
I got, I'm on both healers, guys.

5698
04:41:00,250 --> 04:41:00,770
You ready to push?

5699
04:41:00,830 --> 04:41:01,090
Let's go.

5700
04:41:08,910 --> 04:41:11,990
I got Luna, I got Luna.

5701
04:41:12,210 --> 04:41:13,390
There is a Jeff above us.

5702
04:41:13,390 --> 04:41:15,270
Can we kill him?

5703
04:41:15,270 --> 04:41:15,790
Can we kill him?

5704
04:41:20,750 --> 04:41:22,570
I'm on my healer, I'm on my healer.

5705
04:41:24,630 --> 04:41:26,210
I have a captain.

5706
04:41:27,930 --> 04:41:32,210
Oh, I don't have...

5707
04:41:32,210 --> 04:41:32,910
Oh, okay.

5708
04:41:33,310 --> 04:41:34,150
Oh, okay.

5709
04:41:34,750 --> 04:41:35,130
Okay.

5710
04:41:37,370 --> 04:41:38,850
Do we ban?

5711
04:41:39,050 --> 04:41:40,570
We need a strange portal.

5712
04:41:45,720 --> 04:41:47,160
Oh, we don't have strange.

5713
04:41:47,280 --> 04:41:49,080
I can't go strange too.

5714
04:41:50,200 --> 04:41:51,800
I can't go strange.

5715
04:41:51,920 --> 04:41:52,720
I have to...

5716
04:42:03,130 --> 04:42:04,190
I have Jeff on me.

5717
04:42:07,150 --> 04:42:08,190
Oh, please.

5718
04:42:10,790 --> 04:42:11,650
Okay, guys.

5719
04:42:11,710 --> 04:42:12,930
I'm gonna do something incredibly...

5720
04:42:13,890 --> 04:42:14,590
Oh, I can't.

5721
04:42:28,380 --> 04:42:29,180
Yeah.

5722
04:42:35,360 --> 04:42:38,420
Three, two, one.

5723
04:42:39,920 --> 04:42:40,680
I got, I got one.

5724
04:42:40,820 --> 04:42:41,280
I got one.

5725
04:42:43,360 --> 04:42:45,380
Oh my god.

5726
04:42:46,760 --> 04:42:49,340
No, we're never gonna win.

5727
04:42:49,380 --> 04:42:52,500
We're going forever.

5728
04:43:01,410 --> 04:43:04,410
We're gonna be stuck in purgatory forever.

5729
04:43:16,380 --> 04:43:17,680
Yeah.

5730
04:43:20,340 --> 04:43:22,000
Guys, we can't end on a loss.

5731
04:43:25,900 --> 04:43:26,680
Guys.

5732
04:43:29,610 --> 04:43:31,500
This can't happen.

5733
04:43:32,720 --> 04:43:34,720
Never ending stream.

5734
04:43:35,600 --> 04:43:38,600
It's obviously need one more.

5735
04:43:38,600 --> 04:43:38,740
Alright.

5736
04:43:43,980 --> 04:43:45,220
I can't believe...

5737
04:43:45,220 --> 04:43:46,060
Okay, I'm gonna bleed.

5738
04:43:46,840 --> 04:43:48,600
I do not wanna deal...

5739
04:43:49,140 --> 04:43:50,000
I knew it.

5740
04:43:50,120 --> 04:43:51,220
I knew it.

5741
04:43:51,340 --> 04:43:54,340
I knew they were the Celestial player.

5742
04:43:54,800 --> 04:43:56,500
I fucking knew it.

5743
04:43:59,580 --> 04:44:01,260
I fucking, I could tell.

5744
04:44:01,660 --> 04:44:02,600
I was like, there's no way.

5745
04:44:02,660 --> 04:44:04,860
This feels like freaky Celestial town.

5746
04:44:04,860 --> 04:44:06,720
Like, I...

5747
04:44:06,720 --> 04:44:07,900
Oh my god.

5748
04:44:07,980 --> 04:44:08,660
I fucking...

5749
04:44:08,660 --> 04:44:09,920
I was like, there's no way.

5750
04:44:09,960 --> 04:44:11,300
This feels like...

5751
04:44:11,300 --> 04:44:12,880
Oh my god.

5752
04:44:14,620 --> 04:44:15,580
My elo.

5753
04:44:17,480 --> 04:44:18,900
My fucking elo.

5754
04:44:20,140 --> 04:44:20,840
It's okay.

5755
04:44:20,880 --> 04:44:21,660
I'll get it back.

5756
04:44:21,780 --> 04:44:23,260
I always get it back, guys.

5757
04:44:24,260 --> 04:44:27,020
I can't swap accounts because I'm playing with people.

5758
04:44:27,140 --> 04:44:29,440
If I wasn't playing with people, I'd swap to my ult.

5759
04:44:44,920 --> 04:44:45,540
Oh my...

5760
04:44:45,540 --> 04:44:46,260
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

5761
04:44:46,420 --> 04:44:47,580
I haven't peed at all.

5762
04:44:47,580 --> 04:44:48,760
I'll be right back.

5763
04:45:43,860 --> 04:45:44,780
Okay, guys.

5764
04:45:45,020 --> 04:45:45,520
It's okay.

5765
04:45:45,900 --> 04:45:47,840
We need to play anyway because...

5766
04:45:48,580 --> 04:45:50,880
We need to play anyway because we need...

5767
04:45:51,380 --> 04:45:51,980
We need...

5768
04:45:52,920 --> 04:45:53,460
The quota.

5769
04:45:53,680 --> 04:45:54,980
Don't think about the elo.

5770
04:45:55,280 --> 04:45:56,660
Just think about the quota.

5771
04:46:00,340 --> 04:46:03,520
Just think about the quota.

5772
04:46:03,820 --> 04:46:05,860
Don't think about the loss of elo.

5773
04:46:06,120 --> 04:46:09,320
Just think about the hours I need to stream.

5774
04:46:12,380 --> 04:46:13,060
That's...

5775
04:46:13,060 --> 04:46:13,900
That's it.

5776
04:46:21,830 --> 04:46:22,750
This is it.

5777
04:46:22,870 --> 04:46:23,450
We just...

5778
04:46:23,450 --> 04:46:25,470
We need to get the hours in.

5779
04:46:28,300 --> 04:46:29,840
Okay, are they still...

5780
04:46:29,840 --> 04:46:31,500
Is it still freaky hours or...

5781
04:46:32,260 --> 04:46:34,140
Are people actually killing?

5782
04:46:35,280 --> 04:46:37,280
Are people actually killing?

5783
04:46:37,780 --> 04:46:38,980
Can I actually warm up?

5784
04:46:40,240 --> 04:46:41,700
Oh, that's a dead Penny body.

5785
04:46:41,840 --> 04:46:42,940
Yeah, people are definitely killing.

5786
04:46:44,080 --> 04:46:45,720
Oh my god.

5787
04:46:45,720 --> 04:46:46,160
Oh my god.

5788
04:46:48,820 --> 04:46:51,800
Yeah, people are definitely killing.

5789
04:46:55,560 --> 04:46:59,220
I just see like a fucking fuck you all from the sky.

5790
04:47:00,340 --> 04:47:03,620
I don't think I've only done this map like three times.

5791
04:47:04,260 --> 04:47:05,600
Usually, I never go here.

5792
04:47:09,580 --> 04:47:10,140
What?

5793
04:47:10,420 --> 04:47:12,000
Wait, you guys saw that, right?

5794
04:47:12,460 --> 04:47:13,220
He fucking lagged.

5795
04:47:14,780 --> 04:47:15,900
What the fuck?

5796
04:47:17,080 --> 04:47:18,460
What the fuck was...

5797
04:47:18,460 --> 04:47:20,660
What the fuck is this brawl I'm looking at?

5798
04:47:24,920 --> 04:47:26,100
Oh my god.

5799
04:47:27,460 --> 04:47:28,340
He's scared.

5800
04:47:31,060 --> 04:47:32,100
Oh my...

5801
04:47:32,100 --> 04:47:32,640
Bro, okay.

5802
04:47:33,200 --> 04:47:33,800
Bro, fuck you.

5803
04:47:34,480 --> 04:47:35,040
No!

5804
04:47:40,380 --> 04:47:40,940
Okay.

5805
04:47:41,500 --> 04:47:42,620
Maybe I'll just play Adam.

5806
04:47:43,320 --> 04:47:44,980
I'm just gonna play Adam next game.

5807
04:47:45,900 --> 04:47:46,500
Fuck it.

5808
04:47:47,180 --> 04:47:48,240
I mean, that's all I need.

5809
04:47:49,800 --> 04:47:52,400
The moment I play Adam, it'll be okay, right?

5810
04:47:56,850 --> 04:47:57,370
Okay.

5811
04:47:58,310 --> 04:47:59,250
Goodbye, Chuck.

5812
04:48:00,470 --> 04:48:00,730
Goodbye.

5813
04:48:01,170 --> 04:48:02,210
I don't even play Hela.

5814
04:48:05,170 --> 04:48:07,090
What are you doing here, Mantis?

5815
04:48:09,010 --> 04:48:10,610
Where did the Mantis go?

5816
04:48:17,100 --> 04:48:18,080
What the fuck?

5817
04:48:19,520 --> 04:48:20,920
Yo, fuck that guy though.

5818
04:48:26,560 --> 04:48:26,960
Alright.

5819
04:48:28,360 --> 04:48:29,620
Maybe it'll be different.

5820
04:48:30,040 --> 04:48:31,820
There's no Celestial players now.

5821
04:48:32,600 --> 04:48:33,700
I just need one win.

5822
04:48:36,320 --> 04:48:37,200
I'm playing Adam.

5823
04:48:47,030 --> 04:48:47,990
Okay, this is it.

5824
04:48:50,210 --> 04:48:52,490
We don't have support players except for me.

5825
04:48:52,590 --> 04:48:53,750
Maybe I can't play Adam.

5826
04:48:54,650 --> 04:48:55,210
Maybe.

5827
04:48:55,990 --> 04:48:58,770
Maybe I can't play Adam.

5828
04:48:58,910 --> 04:49:00,290
We don't even...

5829
04:49:00,290 --> 04:49:00,670
Okay.

5830
04:49:00,850 --> 04:49:01,630
Okay.

5831
04:49:04,730 --> 04:49:05,430
What?

5832
04:49:12,120 --> 04:49:13,400
What goes through?

5833
04:49:14,840 --> 04:49:15,540
What?

5834
04:49:16,400 --> 04:49:18,320
What the fuck is...

5835
04:49:18,320 --> 04:49:18,980
What?

5836
04:49:22,250 --> 04:49:24,430
What's going on?

5837
04:49:29,620 --> 04:49:33,320
Why are people mad already?

5838
04:49:34,140 --> 04:49:34,520
What?

5839
04:49:34,720 --> 04:49:36,920
What's going...

5840
04:49:43,420 --> 04:49:44,460
Goodbye.

5841
04:50:02,330 --> 04:50:05,070
He said, fuck that.

5842
04:50:05,810 --> 04:50:08,210
Said, fuck that game.

5843
04:50:08,710 --> 04:50:12,630
I can't.

5844
04:50:20,490 --> 04:50:24,330
Our team already throwing.

5845
04:50:26,290 --> 04:50:31,950
Two, three people on our team hate each other.

5846
04:50:33,130 --> 04:50:37,390
And we're banning their main.

5847
04:50:41,190 --> 04:50:44,470
Holy shit, what the fuck happened?

5848
04:50:48,950 --> 04:50:50,870
Four, three...

5849
04:50:50,870 --> 04:50:53,730
I like how Choppa was like, but winnable.

5850
04:50:54,030 --> 04:50:55,470
Choppa, it was not winnable.

5851
04:50:56,090 --> 04:50:57,850
Choppa, it was...

5852
04:50:57,990 --> 04:51:00,390
It was not winnable.

5853
04:51:00,990 --> 04:51:03,770
Stop going, why go?

5854
04:51:15,610 --> 04:51:17,710
Never give up.

5855
04:51:18,790 --> 04:51:20,770
Komas gave up.

5856
04:51:24,470 --> 04:51:26,490
Never give up.

5857
04:51:27,330 --> 04:51:29,230
That's actually crazy.

5858
04:51:35,070 --> 04:51:37,090
Never give up.

5859
04:51:39,390 --> 04:51:40,950
Holy shit.

5860
04:51:48,630 --> 04:51:51,290
That's crazy, I like Choppa.

5861
04:51:51,650 --> 04:51:53,470
Don't worry, Choppa.

5862
04:51:53,790 --> 04:51:55,810
I'm here for you, Choppa.

5863
04:51:56,270 --> 04:52:00,010
Go, Choppa, go.

5864
04:52:00,530 --> 04:52:02,170
Never give up.

5865
04:52:03,330 --> 04:52:05,050
Goodbye, Choppa.

5866
04:52:07,230 --> 04:52:11,130
We'll never know who these players were that absolutely hate.

5867
04:52:11,490 --> 04:52:13,550
I love this guy.

5868
04:52:14,230 --> 04:52:16,790
Kraken except when he's...

5869
04:52:16,790 --> 04:52:18,050
Oh my god.

5870
04:52:18,590 --> 04:52:21,510
Oh my god, guys.

5871
04:52:22,250 --> 04:52:22,850
Okay.

5872
04:52:23,550 --> 04:52:24,670
Oh, we'll never know.

5873
04:52:24,870 --> 04:52:26,310
It doesn't show who it was.

5874
04:52:26,950 --> 04:52:28,170
I don't even know who they were.

5875
04:52:28,570 --> 04:52:29,330
Who we had.

5876
04:52:30,910 --> 04:52:31,930
Let's see.

5877
04:52:33,230 --> 04:52:35,950
Wait, what account is he gonna be on?

5878
04:52:38,650 --> 04:52:39,870
Oh, never mind.

5879
04:52:41,650 --> 04:52:45,810
Gome has no account in range.

5880
04:52:46,670 --> 04:52:47,310
Duo?

5881
04:52:54,820 --> 04:52:57,540
Yo, he's stupid.

5882
04:53:05,060 --> 04:53:05,820
Okay.

5883
04:53:07,980 --> 04:53:09,240
Not me.

5884
04:53:13,860 --> 04:53:15,440
That's not true.

5885
04:53:16,660 --> 04:53:20,360
I saw you were 200...

5886
04:53:20,360 --> 04:53:21,760
200...

5887
04:53:21,760 --> 04:53:23,860
260...

5888
04:53:23,860 --> 04:53:25,920
Before I invite.

5889
04:53:27,580 --> 04:53:30,540
You were losing before me.

5890
04:53:36,160 --> 04:53:39,900
He was losing before me.

5891
04:53:44,060 --> 04:53:45,720
I don't know.

5892
04:53:50,700 --> 04:53:52,080
Yeah.

5893
04:53:52,620 --> 04:53:53,860
Let's...

5894
04:53:53,860 --> 04:53:54,420
Yeah.

5895
04:53:55,100 --> 04:53:57,320
Let's go to Celestial.

5896
04:53:59,560 --> 04:54:01,040
Can I...

5897
04:54:01,040 --> 04:54:05,540
I will make sure your main is also Celestial.

5898
04:54:09,020 --> 04:54:11,300
Goodbye, 500.

5899
04:54:16,550 --> 04:54:17,610
There we go.

5900
04:54:26,900 --> 04:54:30,140
I don't have keyboard left anymore.

5901
04:54:35,880 --> 04:54:38,360
Play with controller.

5902
04:54:39,800 --> 04:54:41,400
Go, go.

5903
04:54:48,760 --> 04:54:49,820
No keyboard left.

5904
04:54:50,120 --> 04:54:50,300
Shame.

5905
04:54:51,180 --> 04:54:52,060
Feels bad.

5906
04:54:52,920 --> 04:54:54,020
Free ELO night.

5907
04:54:55,300 --> 04:54:55,820
Maybe.

5908
04:54:57,460 --> 04:54:59,800
Now you are FunFun.

5909
04:55:06,540 --> 04:55:07,420
Nice.

5910
04:55:09,560 --> 04:55:11,560
The free ELO isn't going up.

5911
04:55:12,320 --> 04:55:12,780
Wow.

5912
04:55:13,740 --> 04:55:14,760
Wait, is FunFun okay?

5913
04:55:14,760 --> 04:55:17,900
How you know that Korean meme?

5914
04:55:18,620 --> 04:55:19,620
Wait, what?

5915
04:55:19,880 --> 04:55:20,920
It's a meme?

5916
04:55:21,680 --> 04:55:22,420
Where's FunFun?

5917
04:55:23,160 --> 04:55:24,080
Where is he?

5918
04:55:24,280 --> 04:55:24,840
FunFun.

5919
04:55:24,960 --> 04:55:26,180
Oh, no.

5920
04:55:26,400 --> 04:55:27,460
Is FunFun okay?

5921
04:55:28,700 --> 04:55:30,120
Oh, wait.

5922
04:55:30,880 --> 04:55:32,800
Is FunFun okay?

5923
04:55:33,720 --> 04:55:34,900
Oh, wait.

5924
04:55:37,460 --> 04:55:38,300
FunFun.

5925
04:55:38,300 --> 04:55:39,100
Oh.

5926
04:55:42,880 --> 04:55:45,340
Oh, my God.

5927
04:55:46,900 --> 04:55:48,300
FunFun129.

5928
04:55:52,820 --> 04:55:54,920
What happened?

5929
04:55:58,600 --> 04:56:00,000
FunFun...

5930
04:56:01,300 --> 04:56:04,280
What did he do?

5931
04:56:05,560 --> 04:56:09,320
FunFun not so much fun no more.

5932
04:56:10,180 --> 04:56:13,300
He was once a great man.

5933
04:56:13,680 --> 04:56:16,740
What did you do to him?

5934
04:56:19,180 --> 04:56:20,820
Oh, my God.

5935
04:56:24,900 --> 04:56:27,880
He was once a great man, guys.

5936
04:56:29,900 --> 04:56:31,360
Poor guy.

5937
04:56:31,940 --> 04:56:33,040
He's gone.

5938
04:56:33,040 --> 04:56:37,880
He died by his own hands.

5939
04:56:38,000 --> 04:56:40,080
Holy fuck.

5940
04:56:41,780 --> 04:56:45,340
Why didn't you save him?

5941
04:56:46,280 --> 04:56:48,680
You are not save team.

5942
04:56:51,940 --> 04:56:53,360
How could you?

5943
04:56:58,560 --> 04:57:01,340
He chose this.

5944
04:57:03,620 --> 04:57:04,900
I can't...

5945
04:57:05,780 --> 04:57:08,220
He is so far ahead.

5946
04:57:08,700 --> 04:57:10,400
I can't catch him.

5947
04:57:11,680 --> 04:57:13,480
It's the path he chose.

5948
04:57:15,120 --> 04:57:16,380
I'm so sad.

5949
04:57:17,040 --> 04:57:18,560
I'm so sad, guys.

5950
04:57:23,720 --> 04:57:26,020
I can't believe... He used to... Guys.

5951
04:57:27,260 --> 04:57:30,040
FunFun used to be...

5952
04:57:30,890 --> 04:57:33,920
He used to have 500 points, guys.

5953
04:57:37,710 --> 04:57:40,350
He used to have 500 points.

5954
04:57:41,970 --> 04:57:42,590
What?

5955
04:57:44,370 --> 04:57:45,610
Oh, wait.

5956
04:57:45,670 --> 04:57:46,290
What happened?

5957
04:57:47,330 --> 04:57:48,170
Oh, what?

5958
04:57:48,830 --> 04:57:49,390
Why?

5959
04:57:50,590 --> 04:57:51,490
They have Necros?

5960
04:57:51,790 --> 04:57:52,490
Then I'm banning.

5961
04:57:52,810 --> 04:57:55,090
I mean, I'd rather just...

5962
04:57:56,150 --> 04:57:59,610
Wait, is he playing with... Is he playing with Venom player?

5963
04:58:00,510 --> 04:58:01,810
I mean, fine.

5964
04:58:02,430 --> 04:58:05,270
I would just... I would have honestly just banned...

5965
04:58:05,270 --> 04:58:07,190
I would have banned Venom.

5966
04:58:14,300 --> 04:58:15,740
Jesus Christ.

5967
04:58:16,760 --> 04:58:17,480
FunFun.

5968
04:58:20,600 --> 04:58:22,320
I don't fucking know.

5969
04:58:22,560 --> 04:58:23,340
Fuck it.

5970
04:58:23,480 --> 04:58:25,920
He is always a pain to kill.

5971
04:58:27,320 --> 04:58:29,920
I was thinking about banning Venom.

5972
04:58:30,840 --> 04:58:32,680
I wish I banned Venom.

5973
04:58:34,840 --> 04:58:37,940
Fuck FunFun playing... Fuck Chopper playing Venom.

5974
04:58:40,440 --> 04:58:41,040
Yo.

5975
04:58:42,520 --> 04:58:43,160
Okay.

5976
04:58:45,740 --> 04:58:46,600
Why here?

5977
04:58:47,260 --> 04:58:48,200
I mean, I can go Adam.

5978
04:58:52,740 --> 04:58:54,620
I could go Adam.

5979
04:58:55,340 --> 04:58:57,180
If the other one wants to go Luna.

5980
04:58:57,180 --> 04:58:58,220
Luna?

5981
04:59:00,820 --> 04:59:02,020
Fuck it.

5982
04:59:02,320 --> 04:59:03,420
I guess I go Luna.

5983
04:59:09,680 --> 04:59:10,880
I guess...

5984
04:59:10,880 --> 04:59:13,500
Is he... He's just talking to himself.

5985
04:59:13,980 --> 04:59:16,140
Everybody else is just like, what the fuck?

5986
04:59:25,600 --> 04:59:27,400
He's just talking to himself.

5987
04:59:30,600 --> 04:59:32,360
They did not... They don't have Necro...

5988
04:59:32,360 --> 04:59:34,740
Did we just do a random Spider-Man ban for no fucking reason?

5989
04:59:34,860 --> 04:59:37,380
And we're running Mantis Luna without Adam?

5990
04:59:37,700 --> 04:59:38,040
Okay.

5991
04:59:46,800 --> 04:59:49,140
Why the fuck did we... Okay.

5992
04:59:49,840 --> 04:59:51,980
Just did a random Spider-Man for no fucking reason.

5993
04:59:52,460 --> 04:59:55,060
Why did we run Mantis with no Adam?

5994
04:59:55,200 --> 04:59:56,840
That's actually... Now we're actually throwing.

5995
04:59:59,280 --> 05:00:00,660
There was no reason.

5996
05:00:03,620 --> 05:00:05,840
There's actually no reason to...

5997
05:00:09,100 --> 05:00:10,600
Oh, I wanna go up.

5998
05:00:13,180 --> 05:00:14,440
Oh my god, I need to reload.

5999
05:00:15,940 --> 05:00:20,540
Oh my god, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm reloading, I'm reloading, I'm reloading, I'm reloading, I'm reloading.

6000
05:00:23,320 --> 05:00:24,360
I'm reloading.

6001
05:00:28,540 --> 05:00:29,580
Jesus Christ.

6002
05:00:32,020 --> 05:00:35,020
Oh, I might as well, I might just give this to the Venom.

6003
05:00:36,920 --> 05:00:38,380
This is a struggle for me.

6004
05:00:39,140 --> 05:00:40,240
I'm just gonna give it to the Venom.

6005
05:00:46,760 --> 05:00:49,920
Oh my god, guys, don't see the miscast, I've been playing for too long.

6006
05:00:53,860 --> 05:00:54,260
Already?

6007
05:00:54,260 --> 05:00:55,120
Holy shit.

6008
05:00:56,020 --> 05:00:57,000
Hey Mantis, you can ult first.

6009
05:01:02,880 --> 05:01:03,280
Oh.

6010
05:01:03,280 --> 05:01:05,000
Okay, nevermind, I'm dead.

6011
05:01:07,300 --> 05:01:08,580
I'm dead.

6012
05:01:10,180 --> 05:01:11,500
Okay, yeah.

6013
05:01:11,940 --> 05:01:13,800
Okay, let's go.

6014
05:01:20,680 --> 05:01:23,240
Oh, don't fear.

6015
05:01:26,300 --> 05:01:29,380
Oh my god.

6016
05:01:30,580 --> 05:01:32,680
Oh my god.

6017
05:01:33,220 --> 05:01:34,220
Nice.

6018
05:01:34,700 --> 05:01:35,600
I... what?

6019
05:01:36,860 --> 05:01:38,860
I... what?

6020
05:01:39,680 --> 05:01:41,480
When did I kill him?

6021
05:01:41,940 --> 05:01:42,300
Okay.

6022
05:01:43,280 --> 05:01:46,460
They just fell into... okay, cool.

6023
05:01:49,020 --> 05:01:49,660
They lie.

6024
05:01:52,340 --> 05:01:53,340
Oh.

6025
05:01:55,340 --> 05:01:57,360
I was just like, what?

6026
05:01:58,100 --> 05:01:59,380
How did they...

6027
05:02:05,790 --> 05:02:08,010
I was like, how the fuck?

6028
05:02:08,410 --> 05:02:10,110
I didn't even know where they came from.

6029
05:02:10,910 --> 05:02:12,430
I was so confused.

6030
05:02:14,030 --> 05:02:14,910
I was like, where did he go?

6031
05:02:15,030 --> 05:02:15,870
Where did he come from?

6032
05:02:23,890 --> 05:02:25,110
Okay, it's fine.

6033
05:02:25,850 --> 05:02:26,530
It's fine.

6034
05:02:28,790 --> 05:02:29,610
It's fine.

6035
05:02:30,430 --> 05:02:31,050
We're okay.

6036
05:02:33,530 --> 05:02:34,090
We're okay.

6037
05:02:38,220 --> 05:02:39,620
Alright, we're okay.

6038
05:02:41,160 --> 05:02:43,240
I don't know what... I can't hear him.

6039
05:02:45,020 --> 05:02:46,200
I don't want to get Hanzo'd.

6040
05:02:52,650 --> 05:02:53,950
Oh my god.

6041
05:02:54,650 --> 05:02:55,970
I need to get back on the cart.

6042
05:02:58,350 --> 05:03:01,470
I don't want to get Hawkeye'd slash Hanzo'd.

6043
05:03:02,530 --> 05:03:03,870
I'm too scared.

6044
05:03:09,000 --> 05:03:09,620
Okay, I missed.

6045
05:03:10,240 --> 05:03:11,040
That's okay.

6046
05:03:16,300 --> 05:03:17,060
Okay.

6047
05:03:19,880 --> 05:03:21,180
Guys, it's okay.

6048
05:03:22,160 --> 05:03:24,200
I can't hit every shot, guys.

6049
05:03:25,020 --> 05:03:26,860
Oh my god.

6050
05:03:31,080 --> 05:03:32,200
Jesus Christ.

6051
05:03:35,270 --> 05:03:36,910
Oh my god, please.

6052
05:03:38,230 --> 05:03:38,870
Please.

6053
05:03:40,510 --> 05:03:41,250
Nice.

6054
05:03:41,570 --> 05:03:42,330
Oh my god.

6055
05:03:42,770 --> 05:03:43,450
Nice, okay.

6056
05:03:43,450 --> 05:03:45,370
Okay.

6057
05:03:45,370 --> 05:03:46,650
I'm freaking out.

6058
05:03:51,450 --> 05:03:51,970
Okay.

6059
05:03:53,310 --> 05:03:54,130
Top 5 ult.

6060
05:03:56,190 --> 05:03:57,250
Oh, nevermind.

6061
05:03:57,370 --> 05:03:57,650
Don't use.

6062
05:04:00,030 --> 05:04:00,770
Alright.

6063
05:04:02,230 --> 05:04:02,410
Oh.

6064
05:04:04,050 --> 05:04:05,390
Okay, okay.

6065
05:04:05,990 --> 05:04:07,030
What?

6066
05:04:09,130 --> 05:04:10,170
What?

6067
05:04:13,450 --> 05:04:14,790
How did he get that?

6068
05:04:17,510 --> 05:04:18,630
Question mark?

6069
05:04:22,510 --> 05:04:26,650
Okay, we're doing it.

6070
05:04:26,750 --> 05:04:27,690
We're doing it, guys.

6071
05:04:31,810 --> 05:04:33,090
We're doing it.

6072
05:04:34,830 --> 05:04:36,510
Okay, I'm a little scared now.

6073
05:04:40,410 --> 05:04:41,730
I'm a little scared.

6074
05:04:44,230 --> 05:04:48,150
All I'm saying is that Mantis Luna should not be working, but I'll take it.

6075
05:04:49,090 --> 05:04:49,570
That's me.

6076
05:04:50,290 --> 05:04:51,550
JK, he missed?

6077
05:04:55,210 --> 05:04:57,230
Okay, I take those.

6078
05:05:00,650 --> 05:05:01,530
Okay, nice.

6079
05:05:03,910 --> 05:05:05,530
We take those, we take those.

6080
05:05:05,630 --> 05:05:06,630
We take the misses.

6081
05:05:09,930 --> 05:05:10,750
It's okay.

6082
05:05:12,130 --> 05:05:17,450
Normally, Luna Mantis should not be working because that is not a lot of heals.

6083
05:05:17,450 --> 05:05:19,330
But I'm not gonna question it.

6084
05:05:20,070 --> 05:05:22,870
I'm not gonna...

6085
05:05:22,870 --> 05:05:23,350
What?

6086
05:05:23,610 --> 05:05:24,570
That missed?

6087
05:05:25,790 --> 05:05:26,730
Should not have missed.

6088
05:05:27,110 --> 05:05:27,710
What?

6089
05:05:30,330 --> 05:05:31,610
What was my HP?

6090
05:05:36,810 --> 05:05:38,910
Okay, I think I got Hawkeye.

6091
05:05:39,110 --> 05:05:41,330
Yeah, I got Hawkeye headshot.

6092
05:05:41,830 --> 05:05:43,710
I got Hawkeye headshot.

6093
05:05:44,090 --> 05:05:46,070
There was no way I should have died.

6094
05:05:47,890 --> 05:05:49,490
Through Invisa.

6095
05:05:52,560 --> 05:05:55,800
I was like, what happened to me?

6096
05:05:59,100 --> 05:06:00,900
Actually, what happened to me?

6097
05:06:00,920 --> 05:06:01,740
I disappeared.

6098
05:06:02,400 --> 05:06:03,880
I actually disappeared.

6099
05:06:07,040 --> 05:06:07,840
Okay.

6100
05:06:09,960 --> 05:06:12,880
Oh, I don't want to stand near...

6101
05:06:13,520 --> 05:06:14,880
Oh, I...

6102
05:06:15,680 --> 05:06:18,980
I don't know what happens if I stand in front of a Hawkeye.

6103
05:06:22,580 --> 05:06:25,880
Yo, I think maybe...

6104
05:06:26,420 --> 05:06:27,680
It is Gomez.

6105
05:06:40,380 --> 05:06:42,380
No, I want it so bad.

6106
05:06:44,880 --> 05:06:47,060
He didn't drop the silver, guys.

6107
05:06:47,300 --> 05:06:49,140
He didn't drop the silver.

6108
05:06:53,940 --> 05:06:56,560
Let me say easy.

6109
05:07:05,720 --> 05:07:09,700
Don't talk about that, Dark.

6110
05:07:12,140 --> 05:07:15,980
Yeah, my ult was doki doki.

6111
05:07:16,660 --> 05:07:18,620
My Dark Pass.

6112
05:07:19,320 --> 05:07:20,840
Don't talk about...

6113
05:07:22,280 --> 05:07:23,560
That Dark History.

6114
05:07:30,000 --> 05:07:31,120
Wow.

6115
05:07:35,920 --> 05:07:37,320
Wow.

6116
05:07:37,320 --> 05:07:42,900
Overwatch will never be beating Golden Age.

6117
05:07:56,360 --> 05:07:57,760
Jesus.

6118
05:07:58,780 --> 05:08:01,040
What the fuck happened to him?

6119
05:08:02,340 --> 05:08:03,980
Oh my...

6120
05:08:03,980 --> 05:08:06,380
Oh my god.

6121
05:08:07,380 --> 05:08:08,900
What the fuck?

6122
05:08:09,180 --> 05:08:10,240
What happened?

6123
05:08:10,820 --> 05:08:12,520
They all got deleted.

6124
05:08:14,860 --> 05:08:16,500
You do not need healing.

6125
05:08:21,940 --> 05:08:23,400
Oh, I don't want to peek that.

6126
05:08:23,740 --> 05:08:24,880
There's a Hawkeye right there.

6127
05:08:27,320 --> 05:08:29,140
I do not want to peek that.

6128
05:08:34,900 --> 05:08:35,200
Hello.

6129
05:08:37,980 --> 05:08:39,260
What is this Mag doing?

6130
05:08:39,400 --> 05:08:40,060
He's just chilling.

6131
05:08:41,800 --> 05:08:43,800
His entire team is dead.

6132
05:08:43,880 --> 05:08:44,680
Where are you going?

6133
05:08:45,200 --> 05:08:46,300
Where the fuck are you going?

6134
05:08:48,260 --> 05:08:49,860
Wait, I hear somebody.

6135
05:08:50,580 --> 05:08:51,520
Oh, he's gone.

6136
05:08:52,420 --> 05:08:54,780
Our poor Starlord is not having a good time.

6137
05:08:55,880 --> 05:08:56,940
Where did he go?

6138
05:08:57,820 --> 05:08:58,580
Oh, there he is.

6139
05:08:59,020 --> 05:08:59,380
Goodbye.

6140
05:09:01,900 --> 05:09:02,380
Goodbye.

6141
05:09:05,280 --> 05:09:07,560
Honestly, I did not expect to hit that.

6142
05:09:12,760 --> 05:09:13,140
Okay.

6143
05:09:14,200 --> 05:09:16,800
I fucking do not want to look at the Hawkeye.

6144
05:09:17,120 --> 05:09:19,000
If I see a Hawkeye in front of me, I leave.

6145
05:09:24,390 --> 05:09:25,970
Oh, what the fuck?

6146
05:09:26,430 --> 05:09:27,250
What the fuck?

6147
05:09:29,880 --> 05:09:31,500
Where did I go?

6148
05:09:33,320 --> 05:09:35,000
What the fuck?

6149
05:09:36,900 --> 05:09:37,740
Hello?

6150
05:09:46,920 --> 05:09:48,560
No, no!

6151
05:09:48,760 --> 05:09:49,720
Oh wait, it's okay.

6152
05:09:53,240 --> 05:09:54,080
Please!

6153
05:09:54,580 --> 05:09:55,220
Please!

6154
05:09:55,680 --> 05:09:57,480
I just got home!

6155
05:09:57,480 --> 05:09:58,500
Please!

6156
05:09:59,960 --> 05:10:00,180
What?

6157
05:10:01,080 --> 05:10:02,300
I died.

6158
05:10:02,560 --> 05:10:06,740
I died.

6159
05:10:07,100 --> 05:10:07,840
Bye, Panther.

6160
05:10:12,580 --> 05:10:14,060
Okay, nice.

6161
05:10:15,060 --> 05:10:16,160
Thank you.

6162
05:10:16,260 --> 05:10:17,440
Thank you, bodyguard.

6163
05:10:22,760 --> 05:10:23,880
It's okay.

6164
05:10:24,680 --> 05:10:26,080
We're alive.

6165
05:10:27,060 --> 05:10:28,300
Wakanda forever.

6166
05:10:29,860 --> 05:10:31,240
Wait, I hear it back.

6167
05:10:31,400 --> 05:10:32,280
Black Panther behind us.

6168
05:10:34,260 --> 05:10:35,100
Oh my god.

6169
05:10:35,400 --> 05:10:36,520
Not again!

6170
05:10:37,600 --> 05:10:38,960
Never again!

6171
05:10:41,000 --> 05:10:42,120
That was a heal diff.

6172
05:10:42,820 --> 05:10:44,260
We have Mantis!

6173
05:10:47,160 --> 05:10:49,280
We have Mantis!

6174
05:10:49,620 --> 05:10:51,940
How could it ever be a heal diff?

6175
05:10:51,940 --> 05:10:55,700
We have significantly less heals.

6176
05:10:57,620 --> 05:10:59,140
I am not...

6177
05:10:59,140 --> 05:11:02,480
I will not dealing with this again.

6178
05:11:03,380 --> 05:11:04,740
You can't get me.

6179
05:11:06,800 --> 05:11:09,400
Oh, three, two, one.

6180
05:11:21,460 --> 05:11:22,740
It's okay.

6181
05:11:28,500 --> 05:11:30,760
It's okay, everything's fine.

6182
05:11:33,360 --> 05:11:34,980
Everything is fine.

6183
05:11:42,780 --> 05:11:45,140
Okay, he's coming over.

6184
05:11:45,220 --> 05:11:46,580
He's coming!

6185
05:11:47,020 --> 05:11:47,280
Please!

6186
05:11:48,220 --> 05:11:49,860
Please, Mantis!

6187
05:11:50,480 --> 05:11:52,640
I need one E!

6188
05:11:53,060 --> 05:11:55,560
One E and everything will be okay!

6189
05:11:56,880 --> 05:11:58,260
One E!

6190
05:11:58,580 --> 05:11:59,360
Please!

6191
05:11:59,940 --> 05:12:01,800
Just one little E!

6192
05:12:06,100 --> 05:12:07,000
Please!

6193
05:12:08,480 --> 05:12:11,380
If I get one E, I can live!

6194
05:12:15,980 --> 05:12:17,440
That's all it takes!

6195
05:12:17,640 --> 05:12:20,440
I know it's actually crazy to think about.

6196
05:12:24,680 --> 05:12:27,040
Bro, this is rage, babe.

6197
05:12:27,520 --> 05:12:29,120
What's going on?

6198
05:12:29,120 --> 05:12:29,500
Ah!

6199
05:12:38,690 --> 05:12:41,910
I'm getting cyberbullied!

6200
05:12:42,470 --> 05:12:44,410
I'm getting cyberbullied!

6201
05:12:44,870 --> 05:12:48,990
Somebody get me out of here!

6202
05:12:50,430 --> 05:12:54,330
I'm actually getting cyberbullied on stream!

6203
05:12:55,210 --> 05:12:57,450
Like, why is it me?

6204
05:12:57,450 --> 05:12:58,870
Why is it me?

6205
05:12:59,170 --> 05:13:01,370
Why is it me?

6206
05:13:01,890 --> 05:13:02,910
I don't...

6207
05:13:03,010 --> 05:13:05,510
I don't understand!

6208
05:13:07,030 --> 05:13:08,450
Oh, no.

6209
05:13:09,870 --> 05:13:10,790
Please.

6210
05:13:11,430 --> 05:13:12,150
I'm just behind.

6211
05:13:13,650 --> 05:13:15,150
Oh my god.

6212
05:13:20,390 --> 05:13:21,690
I'm sorry!

6213
05:13:22,110 --> 05:13:23,070
I'm sorry!

6214
05:13:23,390 --> 05:13:25,170
I don't want to deal with this!

6215
05:13:28,110 --> 05:13:31,550
I needed the Mantis to know what it feels like!

6216
05:13:31,870 --> 05:13:33,390
I needed...

6217
05:13:33,390 --> 05:13:34,990
Oh my god!

6218
05:13:35,430 --> 05:13:37,970
Okay, now the Mantis knows what it felt like!

6219
05:13:38,110 --> 05:13:39,230
Now he knows!

6220
05:13:40,290 --> 05:13:41,910
Now he fucking knows!

6221
05:13:44,530 --> 05:13:49,790
I was not... I wasn't gonna save... I wasn't gonna try and save our Mantis with the ult.

6222
05:13:51,070 --> 05:13:53,430
I needed him to know what it felt like there.

6223
05:13:54,190 --> 05:13:55,230
It's karma.

6224
05:13:55,610 --> 05:13:57,070
It's actual karma.

6225
05:14:00,070 --> 05:14:02,030
Oh my god, he didn't hit that?

6226
05:14:04,370 --> 05:14:06,150
I'm surprised he didn't hit that.

6227
05:14:07,730 --> 05:14:09,210
No, no, don't get me!

6228
05:14:09,870 --> 05:14:13,130
He ran the same way as me!

6229
05:14:15,430 --> 05:14:17,930
I thought he would run the opposite way.

6230
05:14:17,990 --> 05:14:18,970
Why did he follow me?

6231
05:14:20,870 --> 05:14:22,610
Why did he follow me?

6232
05:14:22,610 --> 05:14:26,590
Why did I get... I chose that path first!

6233
05:14:27,390 --> 05:14:29,070
I was there first!

6234
05:14:29,550 --> 05:14:31,490
What the fuck do you mean?

6235
05:14:32,650 --> 05:14:34,770
I chose that path first!

6236
05:14:38,670 --> 05:14:40,710
Maybe it wasn't going...

6237
05:14:43,410 --> 05:14:44,730
I hear him.

6238
05:14:45,590 --> 05:14:47,230
I hear him!

6239
05:14:47,670 --> 05:14:48,950
I hear him!

6240
05:14:49,830 --> 05:14:51,690
Guys, I hear him!

6241
05:14:52,610 --> 05:14:54,070
I hear him!

6242
05:14:56,790 --> 05:14:57,770
Don't...

6243
05:14:57,770 --> 05:14:59,010
Oh, please...

6244
05:14:59,010 --> 05:14:59,990
PLEASE!

6245
05:15:00,490 --> 05:15:01,330
Mantis!

6246
05:15:01,990 --> 05:15:03,990
I need one macro!

6247
05:15:08,080 --> 05:15:08,520
Please!

6248
05:15:09,840 --> 05:15:11,240
Please, Mantis!

6249
05:15:11,920 --> 05:15:14,140
Please, just give me one E!

6250
05:15:14,980 --> 05:15:15,960
Please!

6251
05:15:18,640 --> 05:15:20,220
It's all I want in life.

6252
05:15:25,300 --> 05:15:25,920
Please!

6253
05:15:26,160 --> 05:15:26,500
Please!

6254
05:15:26,660 --> 05:15:27,320
Oh my God!

6255
05:15:27,460 --> 05:15:28,460
Oh my God!

6256
05:15:28,800 --> 05:15:30,060
The only way to live!

6257
05:15:35,580 --> 05:15:37,080
Oh my God!

6258
05:15:37,480 --> 05:15:38,760
Oh my God!

6259
05:15:39,580 --> 05:15:40,380
Oh my...

6260
05:15:40,380 --> 05:15:41,400
This is the only way to live.

6261
05:15:41,840 --> 05:15:47,680
This is the only way to live.

6262
05:15:48,520 --> 05:15:50,960
Oh my God, we make history!

6263
05:15:55,460 --> 05:15:57,580
We did it!

6264
05:15:57,880 --> 05:16:01,660
Okay, but should we try winning as a trio though?

6265
05:16:02,700 --> 05:16:08,080
He wants to come back.

6266
05:16:11,160 --> 05:16:13,740
Do we let him back in?

6267
05:16:19,940 --> 05:16:21,540
Google him.

6268
05:16:31,460 --> 05:16:32,860
Google him!

6269
05:16:32,860 --> 05:16:34,360
Yeah, Google him!

6270
05:16:42,320 --> 05:16:44,780
Gomez body monkey.

6271
05:16:48,980 --> 05:16:52,220
Do we get him?

6272
05:16:54,180 --> 05:16:54,880
Wait...

6273
05:16:54,880 --> 05:16:56,240
No, Gomez!

6274
05:16:58,160 --> 05:16:59,640
Where is he?

6275
05:17:00,120 --> 05:17:01,360
Is he banned?

6276
05:17:08,460 --> 05:17:09,280
Okay...

6277
05:17:09,280 --> 05:17:10,220
Where is he?

6278
05:17:10,540 --> 05:17:11,560
Wait, he got off!

6279
05:17:13,200 --> 05:17:14,020
Yo...

6280
05:17:14,020 --> 05:17:15,530
What a...

6281
05:17:15,840 --> 05:17:16,540
Keep this...

6282
05:17:16,540 --> 05:17:16,860
Okay!

6283
05:17:23,800 --> 05:17:25,740
He got kicked out!

6284
05:17:28,540 --> 05:17:30,180
Yo, okay...

6285
05:17:30,180 --> 05:17:31,450
I'm just playing.

6286
05:17:32,900 --> 05:17:36,360
Okay, I'm telling it, Gomez.

6287
05:17:38,280 --> 05:17:39,660
Get used to it.

6288
05:17:48,140 --> 05:17:51,260
He got voted off the island!

6289
05:17:56,380 --> 05:17:57,260
Nah...

6290
05:17:58,920 --> 05:17:59,800
Nah...

6291
05:18:00,800 --> 05:18:02,260
How's Adobe doing?

6292
05:18:03,400 --> 05:18:04,900
Okay, what if...

6293
05:18:04,900 --> 05:18:06,120
Okay, I know I said...

6294
05:18:06,120 --> 05:18:06,720
What if we...

6295
05:18:06,720 --> 05:18:07,500
Last game if we win?

6296
05:18:07,620 --> 05:18:10,220
But like, what if we win as a stack though?

6297
05:18:10,720 --> 05:18:12,300
What if we...

6298
05:18:13,120 --> 05:18:13,460
Don't...

6299
05:18:13,460 --> 05:18:15,100
Yo, don't call the Adobe!

6300
05:18:16,880 --> 05:18:18,060
But why...

6301
05:18:18,860 --> 05:18:20,060
What happened...

6302
05:18:20,060 --> 05:18:21,920
What happened...

6303
05:18:21,920 --> 05:18:23,240
To the Adobe?

6304
05:18:30,780 --> 05:18:31,920
Where is he?

6305
05:18:38,470 --> 05:18:39,630
This place, huh?

6306
05:18:40,750 --> 05:18:41,750
What did he do?

6307
05:18:46,990 --> 05:18:48,370
Think of the quota, you're right!

6308
05:18:48,470 --> 05:18:49,110
Think of the quota!

6309
05:18:53,530 --> 05:18:54,530
Think of...

6310
05:18:54,530 --> 05:18:55,730
There you go.

6311
05:19:00,510 --> 05:19:02,950
Choppa said you suck, Gomez.

6312
05:19:10,750 --> 05:19:11,430
Liar!

6313
05:19:36,950 --> 05:19:37,730
Dude...

6314
05:19:37,730 --> 05:19:39,650
You fake!

6315
05:19:46,420 --> 05:19:47,230
Thank you guys.

6316
05:19:47,310 --> 05:19:49,270
Thank you for the partner anniversary, everybody.

6317
05:19:49,710 --> 05:19:51,350
I really appreciate it.

6318
05:19:53,010 --> 05:19:53,410
Yeah.

6319
05:19:53,830 --> 05:19:54,890
Go, go.

6320
05:19:59,500 --> 05:20:00,180
Did...

6321
05:20:00,180 --> 05:20:01,540
Did you cry?

6322
05:20:07,150 --> 05:20:08,430
Did you cry?

6323
05:20:09,250 --> 05:20:10,550
How did it feel...

6324
05:20:11,210 --> 05:20:12,530
When you saw us...

6325
05:20:12,530 --> 05:20:13,590
Saw us win?

6326
05:20:23,350 --> 05:20:25,730
He was in the corner.

6327
05:20:29,410 --> 05:20:30,130
Damn.

6328
05:20:31,970 --> 05:20:32,870
This is not my fault.

6329
05:20:33,170 --> 05:20:34,270
This is all Potty's fault.

6330
05:20:39,150 --> 05:20:39,990
Guys...

6331
05:20:39,990 --> 05:20:41,850
It's not my fault, guys.

6332
05:20:45,240 --> 05:20:46,220
It's all...

6333
05:20:46,220 --> 05:20:47,700
It's not my fault.

6334
05:20:50,760 --> 05:20:52,440
I'm badass.

6335
05:20:54,100 --> 05:20:54,940
Exactly.

6336
05:20:56,400 --> 05:20:58,860
I was winning, guys.

6337
05:20:59,260 --> 05:21:00,580
I was winning.

6338
05:21:05,340 --> 05:21:06,380
It's okay.

6339
05:21:06,780 --> 05:21:07,880
We're doing better.

6340
05:21:09,400 --> 05:21:10,980
It's getting...

6341
05:21:10,980 --> 05:21:12,940
Things do get better, guys.

6342
05:21:12,940 --> 05:21:14,320
It gets better.

6343
05:21:14,820 --> 05:21:16,580
It really does.

6344
05:21:16,680 --> 05:21:17,660
I am the example.

6345
05:21:22,200 --> 05:21:23,420
Things do get better.

6346
05:21:25,100 --> 05:21:27,380
Things might be tough back then.

6347
05:21:27,520 --> 05:21:27,820
But...

6348
05:21:28,360 --> 05:21:29,740
It's gonna turn around.

6349
05:21:35,970 --> 05:21:36,610
See?

6350
05:21:39,570 --> 05:21:40,410
No.

6351
05:21:41,650 --> 05:21:42,930
Choppa is cooler.

6352
05:21:43,910 --> 05:21:44,750
And better.

6353
05:21:56,110 --> 05:21:58,010
You just right.

6354
05:22:15,500 --> 05:22:18,200
Yeah, my five sleeps made him come back.

6355
05:22:18,360 --> 05:22:19,200
Made him...

6356
05:22:19,200 --> 05:22:20,300
Let me kidnap him.

6357
05:22:24,760 --> 05:22:25,860
Tell the police...

6358
05:22:26,460 --> 05:22:27,920
Okay, what if I can play Adam now?

6359
05:22:30,900 --> 05:22:32,060
I'm gonna do it.

6360
05:22:33,240 --> 05:22:34,980
It's gonna work this time.

6361
05:22:38,440 --> 05:22:39,960
It's gonna work this time.

6362
05:22:50,910 --> 05:22:52,610
I did win on Luna, though.

6363
05:22:53,310 --> 05:22:54,310
I don't know why.

6364
05:22:54,430 --> 05:22:55,150
Whenever I stream...

6365
05:22:55,150 --> 05:22:55,650
Oh, nice.

6366
05:22:55,790 --> 05:22:58,130
They also are going through Venom PTSD.

6367
05:22:58,470 --> 05:22:59,250
Thank fucking God.

6368
05:22:59,730 --> 05:23:00,810
I'm glad that...

6369
05:23:00,810 --> 05:23:03,510
I'm glad that they're going through Venom PTSD as well.

6370
05:23:05,470 --> 05:23:06,030
I'm...

6371
05:23:06,790 --> 05:23:07,350
I'm...

6372
05:23:07,350 --> 05:23:10,370
Oh, that makes me so happy.

6373
05:23:13,510 --> 05:23:14,630
He did it!

6374
05:23:14,710 --> 05:23:16,430
Choppa finally did it!

6375
05:23:17,850 --> 05:23:20,630
He's not Venom noob anymore.

6376
05:23:26,570 --> 05:23:27,510
Oh, shit.

6377
05:23:30,970 --> 05:23:31,430
Okay.

6378
05:23:32,950 --> 05:23:34,130
Choppa, it's time.

6379
05:23:35,650 --> 05:23:36,450
Choppa, mercy.

6380
05:23:36,870 --> 05:23:37,430
Play...

6381
05:23:37,430 --> 05:23:38,750
Play mercy.

6382
05:23:38,890 --> 05:23:39,250
Oh, wait.

6383
05:23:39,370 --> 05:23:39,890
Never mind.

6384
05:23:40,110 --> 05:23:41,130
Choppa, no play mercy.

6385
05:23:42,150 --> 05:23:43,110
Choppa, dang.

6386
05:23:44,710 --> 05:23:45,510
And I skipped it.

6387
05:23:45,590 --> 05:23:47,510
Thank you for getting two tier one subs.

6388
05:23:47,510 --> 05:23:48,510
Thank you, thank you.

6389
05:23:53,240 --> 05:23:54,080
Okay.

6390
05:23:54,320 --> 05:23:55,900
If Adam doesn't work, I'll swap.

6391
05:24:02,750 --> 05:24:04,090
Thanks, number three.

6392
05:24:04,550 --> 05:24:06,390
I do my best.

6393
05:24:08,590 --> 05:24:10,930
It can't be that bad, guys.

6394
05:24:12,030 --> 05:24:14,250
Life can't be that bad.

6395
05:24:17,980 --> 05:24:19,340
I have 16 days.

6396
05:24:20,480 --> 05:24:22,160
16 days.

6397
05:24:23,820 --> 05:24:27,420
I have to do the stacking thing again soon, guys.

6398
05:24:29,080 --> 05:24:29,420
Oh.

6399
05:24:30,720 --> 05:24:32,380
Chichi, go next.

6400
05:24:36,360 --> 05:24:37,040
Okay.

6401
05:24:38,600 --> 05:24:40,800
If we lose, it's all on me.

6402
05:24:40,860 --> 05:24:41,380
All good.

6403
05:24:48,460 --> 05:24:48,800
Five.

6404
05:24:49,360 --> 05:24:50,720
Oh, it's totally five.

6405
05:24:54,120 --> 05:24:54,800
Wait.

6406
05:24:55,540 --> 05:24:57,140
I hear a flanking Jeff.

6407
05:24:59,360 --> 05:25:00,180
Flanking Jeff?

6408
05:25:07,730 --> 05:25:08,830
I need to reload.

6409
05:25:12,550 --> 05:25:13,850
Goodbye, clone.

6410
05:25:15,410 --> 05:25:15,890
Goodbye.

6411
05:25:21,610 --> 05:25:23,290
There's a Jeff behind us.

6412
05:25:28,290 --> 05:25:29,190
Oh my god.

6413
05:25:30,570 --> 05:25:32,410
I don't have heals left.

6414
05:25:37,630 --> 05:25:38,770
Oh my god.

6415
05:25:39,190 --> 05:25:40,270
Save him.

6416
05:25:43,110 --> 05:25:44,690
I'm at zero heals.

6417
05:25:46,750 --> 05:25:47,330
Please.

6418
05:25:47,870 --> 05:25:49,570
I can't offer anymore.

6419
05:25:51,770 --> 05:25:52,350
Please.

6420
05:25:52,510 --> 05:25:53,030
Oh, I can.

6421
05:25:53,590 --> 05:25:54,450
I'm still at zero though.

6422
05:25:55,370 --> 05:25:55,970
Oh my god.

6423
05:25:56,390 --> 05:25:57,330
You're so bun.

6424
05:25:59,770 --> 05:26:00,710
Oh my god.

6425
05:26:00,710 --> 05:26:02,190
Oh my god.

6426
05:26:02,250 --> 05:26:03,350
I feel so weak.

6427
05:26:05,370 --> 05:26:06,350
No soulbond.

6428
05:26:11,060 --> 05:26:11,740
Nice.

6429
05:26:12,020 --> 05:26:12,760
What the fuck?

6430
05:26:12,800 --> 05:26:13,720
Where did he come from?

6431
05:26:16,400 --> 05:26:17,520
Okay, nice.

6432
05:26:17,880 --> 05:26:18,940
We're doing it!

6433
05:26:19,660 --> 05:26:20,080
Yes!

6434
05:26:21,420 --> 05:26:22,600
Oh, fuck!

6435
05:26:26,250 --> 05:26:26,750
It's okay.

6436
05:26:29,890 --> 05:26:30,890
It's okay.

6437
05:26:34,980 --> 05:26:36,720
I have no more heals now.

6438
05:26:36,720 --> 05:26:40,260
I can be reserved with these.

6439
05:26:43,480 --> 05:26:45,180
Get out of here.

6440
05:26:48,520 --> 05:26:49,680
Don't worry.

6441
05:26:50,040 --> 05:26:51,700
My soulbond will last throughout this.

6442
05:26:53,500 --> 05:26:54,460
Oh my god.

6443
05:26:54,500 --> 05:26:55,200
I got swallowed.

6444
05:26:57,800 --> 05:26:58,420
Goodbye.

6445
05:26:59,420 --> 05:26:59,900
Goodbye.

6446
05:27:00,540 --> 05:27:01,480
Oh, please.

6447
05:27:02,920 --> 05:27:04,100
I don't...

6448
05:27:04,100 --> 05:27:04,840
Oh no.

6449
05:27:06,720 --> 05:27:07,620
That's unlucky.

6450
05:27:09,420 --> 05:27:10,620
That's unlucky.

6451
05:27:11,060 --> 05:27:11,820
TP, TP, TP.

6452
05:27:13,620 --> 05:27:14,900
I saw, I saw.

6453
05:27:15,360 --> 05:27:18,600
Okay, I'm going to walk over.

Everybody is okay.

6457
05:27:39,360 --> 05:27:39,800
Okay.

6458
05:27:42,860 --> 05:27:44,000
Wait, what the fuck?

6459
05:27:44,120 --> 05:27:44,900
There's a hell of a buff.

6460
05:27:47,940 --> 05:27:49,160
Oh my god.

6461
05:27:49,540 --> 05:27:52,620

05:27:56,040 --> 05:27:57,940
His AD was too good, guys.

05:28:05,600 --> 05:28:08,020
I'm heading there as soon as I can.

6467
05:28:09,580 --> 05:28:11,060
I'm on the point.

6468
05:28:12,280 --> 05:28:14,340

6472
05:28:26,660 --> 05:28:27,580
Okay.

6477
05:28:43,280 --> 05:28:44,700
Two seconds, two seconds.

05:28:47,900 --> 05:28:49,080
Okay, there we go.

6479
05:28:55,180 --> 05:28:57,660
No problem, no problem, no problem.

6480
05:29:02,080 --> 05:29:03,640
There we go.

6481
05:29:11,320 --> 05:29:13,340
We're not finished yet.

6482
05:29:18,180 --> 05:29:19,580
Oh my god.

6483
05:29:19,760 --> 05:29:21,560

I really appreciate it.

6488
05:29:28,440 --> 05:29:30,800
For those who don't know me, my name is Doki Bird.

6489
05:29:31,320 --> 05:29:35,820
I usually stream on YouTube, but now I'm here on Twitch because I have a partnership with Rivals.

6490
05:29:36,440 --> 05:29:38,580
I'm out of quota of hours.

6491
05:29:38,800 --> 05:29:40,180
So that's why I'm here.

6492
05:29:40,760 --> 05:29:41,940
It's okay, we're losing.

6493
05:29:42,140 --> 05:29:43,240
It's all about the quota.

6494
05:29:43,720 --> 05:29:45,580
It's all about the quota, guys.

6495
05:29:46,940 --> 05:29:48,780
Money over rank elo.

6496
05:29:49,140 --> 05:29:50,900
Oh, but the badge is so shiny.

6497
05:29:51,880 --> 05:29:53,320
Oh, but the badge.

6498
05:29:53,400 --> 05:29:54,360
Okay, we'll fix it.

6499
05:29:54,420 --> 05:29:55,900
We'll fix our elo off stream.

6500
05:29:56,520 --> 05:29:57,880
We can fix it off stream.

6501
05:29:58,060 --> 05:30:01,160
Of course, of course, of course.

6502
05:30:04,080 --> 05:30:07,680
Here for that congratulatory content.

6503
05:30:09,840 --> 05:30:10,720
But it's shiny!

6504
05:30:17,240 --> 05:30:17,880
Alright.

6505
05:30:20,720 --> 05:30:21,320
Hold on.

6506
05:30:22,980 --> 05:30:24,120
I need Mantis, Mantis real quick.

6507
05:30:27,620 --> 05:30:28,260
Okay.

6508
05:30:29,840 --> 05:30:31,320
Oh my god, and I hit a headshot.

6509
05:30:32,180 --> 05:30:33,820
Okay, that was useless.

6510
05:30:34,120 --> 05:30:35,180
That was useless.

6511
05:30:35,880 --> 05:30:36,440
There's a clown.

6512
05:30:42,180 --> 05:30:42,580
Okay.

6513
05:30:44,680 --> 05:30:45,960
So he was throwing.

6514
05:30:50,690 --> 05:30:52,130
He was throwing.

6515
05:30:52,610 --> 05:30:53,910
Oh my god!

6516
05:30:55,710 --> 05:30:57,910
Oh my god!

6517
05:30:58,610 --> 05:30:59,990
You're fucking welcome!

6518
05:31:00,890 --> 05:31:02,990
Please, please, please.

6519
05:31:02,990 --> 05:31:03,390
What is this?

6520
05:31:04,570 --> 05:31:09,150
I swear to god, if you do not kill him, I swear to god.

6521
05:31:12,030 --> 05:31:13,090
Thank god, okay.

6522
05:31:13,190 --> 05:31:14,490
I'm fucking TPing here.

6523
05:31:21,590 --> 05:31:23,410
Get these clones out of here.

6524
05:31:24,410 --> 05:31:25,750
There's a Jeff up there.

6525
05:31:28,910 --> 05:31:30,070
Wait, Jeff's on me.

6526
05:31:36,520 --> 05:31:37,460
Yeah, that's right.

6527
05:31:39,500 --> 05:31:41,140
Oh, oh, two portals.

6528
05:31:45,790 --> 05:31:46,810
No lamp.

6529
05:31:52,500 --> 05:31:53,120
Anyways.

6530
05:31:54,060 --> 05:31:54,820
Oh, fuck you.

6531
05:31:56,460 --> 05:31:59,320
Wait, how did he get back?

6532
05:32:01,920 --> 05:32:02,720
That's right.

6533
05:32:03,000 --> 05:32:03,800
Fuck you.

6534
05:32:04,420 --> 05:32:05,640
Oh my god!

6535
05:32:06,380 --> 05:32:07,360
We did it!

6536
05:32:08,340 --> 05:32:09,260
Monkey's back.

6537
05:32:09,360 --> 05:32:10,020
I'm not a problem.

6538
05:32:10,200 --> 05:32:11,560
He's not the problem!

6539
05:32:12,280 --> 05:32:14,040
Okay, that my LG.

6540
05:32:18,740 --> 05:32:19,700

6541
05:32:19,840 --> 05:32:20,300

6542
05:32:21,060 --> 05:32:21,780
Monkey.

6543
05:32:28,840 --> 05:32:30,260
That's my LG.

6544
05:32:30,380 --> 05:32:31,120
We did it!

6545
05:32:31,600 --> 05:32:33,680
We did it, guys!

6546
05:32:34,620 --> 05:32:35,800
I sleep.

6547
05:32:36,620 --> 05:32:38,760
It's 5am!

6548
05:32:39,740 --> 05:32:41,660
I can't keep going!

6549
05:32:43,860 --> 05:32:44,820
GG.

6550
05:32:45,780 --> 05:32:47,820
Don't drop like FunFun.

6551
05:32:55,140 --> 05:32:56,620
GG's, everyone.

6552
05:32:57,400 --> 05:32:59,180
We are not the problem.

6553
05:33:05,700 --> 05:33:10,080
Look, we did it, guys.

6554
05:33:10,180 --> 05:33:11,380
We weren't the problem.

6555
05:33:11,860 --> 05:33:12,280
See?

6556
05:33:12,700 --> 05:33:14,060
We can win!

6557
05:33:16,520 --> 05:33:17,160
Guys!

6558
05:33:17,880 --> 05:33:19,620
We can win!

6559
05:33:20,680 --> 05:33:22,380
I'm not pulling up my history.

6560
05:33:22,860 --> 05:33:23,680
I'm not.

6561
05:33:24,000 --> 05:33:25,740
I'm only down...

6562
05:33:25,740 --> 05:33:27,460
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

6563
05:33:28,680 --> 05:33:30,280
I'm down 3 games, technically.

6564
05:33:32,480 --> 05:33:33,840
I rounded down.

6565
05:33:34,880 --> 05:33:36,000
I'm down 3 games.

6566
05:33:36,340 --> 05:33:36,980
But I'm not...

6567
05:33:36,980 --> 05:33:37,980
We're not the problem.

6568
05:33:41,960 --> 05:33:42,600
It's...

6569
05:33:42,600 --> 05:33:43,740
It's fine.

6570
05:33:43,740 --> 05:33:44,500
We're just...

6571
05:33:44,500 --> 05:33:45,360
We're just down...

6572
05:33:45,360 --> 05:33:46,680
We're down 3 games.

6573
05:33:47,240 --> 05:33:48,080
No, we're not showing...

6574
05:33:48,080 --> 05:33:48,700
Okay, anyway.

6575
05:33:48,920 --> 05:33:50,160
Thank you, everybody, for watching.

6576
05:33:50,340 --> 05:33:53,120
I hope you guys had...

6577
05:33:53,120 --> 05:33:53,700
I'm not...

6578
05:33:53,700 --> 05:33:56,260
It's 5 in the morning and I need to walk my dog.

6579
05:33:57,240 --> 05:33:57,600
Anyway.

6580
05:33:57,960 --> 05:33:59,260
I had a great time today.

6581
05:33:59,420 --> 05:34:00,480
I might stream again tomorrow.

6582
05:34:01,800 --> 05:34:02,980
Because I just want to make...

6583
05:34:02,980 --> 05:34:05,780
I want to see if I can get the quota in within this week.

6584
05:34:06,280 --> 05:34:07,820
So I don't have to worry about next week.

6585
05:34:08,180 --> 05:34:08,900
But anyway, guys.

6586
05:34:09,080 --> 05:34:10,200
Thank you all for coming.

6587
05:34:11,360 --> 05:34:13,440
For those who are new here, my name is DokiBird.

6588
05:34:13,440 --> 05:34:15,040
I usually stream on YouTube.

6589
05:34:15,200 --> 05:34:16,120
So please check me out there.

05:34:16,220 --> 05:34:20,340
You can do exclamation point socials or exclamation point...

6591
05:34:20,340 --> 05:34:21,260
I think it's YouTube.

6592
05:34:21,440 --> 05:34:21,880
I don't know.

6593
05:34:22,180 --> 05:34:25,100
If you guys want to know whenever I stream on Twitch, please follow me on Twitter.

6594
05:34:25,240 --> 05:34:28,840
Because I usually tweet out whenever I stream on Twitch.

6595
05:34:29,060 --> 05:34:30,820
So follow me on Twitter there.

6596
05:34:31,220 --> 05:34:36,220
And if you guys want to support me on other means, I do have a couple of merch stuff that's being sold right now.

05:34:37,900 --> 05:34:38,860
Some official plushies.

6599
05:34:39,200 --> 05:34:41,240
So exclamation point...

6600
05:34:41,240 --> 05:34:42,300
What was it?

6601
05:34:42,300 --> 05:34:42,660
Plush.

6602
05:34:42,780 --> 05:34:44,300

6604
05:34:46,720 --> 05:34:50,040
If you want to grab some official DokiBird merch.

Right there.

6606
05:34:50,920 --> 05:34:51,000
Wait.

6607
05:34:51,100 --> 05:34:52,380
Let me see if I can...

6608
05:34:52,380 --> 05:34:53,740
Where's the picture of it?

6609
05:34:54,100 --> 05:34:54,680
Live now.

6610
05:34:54,860 --> 05:34:55,140
Yes.

05:34:55,580 --> 05:35:00,200
So I do have official plushies that you can buy right now.

6612
05:35:01,040 --> 05:35:03,860
If you guys want to support me via other means, it really does help out a lot.

6613
05:35:04,100 --> 05:35:04,620
Hey, guys.

6614
05:35:04,920 --> 05:35:05,720
I'm going to head off now.

6615
05:35:05,860 --> 05:35:06,460

6616
05:35:06,560 --> 05:35:07,480

Stay hydrated.

6621
05:35:10,380 --> 05:35:10,800
Pause your check.

6622
05:35:11,100 --> 05:35:12,900
Grab and move around to get that blood flowing.

6623
05:35:13,060 --> 05:35:13,520
And if you want...

6624
05:35:14,760 --> 05:35:15,120
Sorry.

6625
05:35:15,280 --> 05:35:15,600
What was it?

6626
05:35:16,120 --> 05:35:16,480
Sorry.

6627
05:35:16,700 --> 05:35:17,880
My brain freezed there.

6628
05:35:18,160 --> 05:35:18,940
Too many rivals.

6629
05:35:19,880 --> 05:35:21,620
And if you stayed up for me, head to...

6630
05:35:21,620 --> 05:35:22,380
Sorry, I stumbled.

6631
05:35:22,740 --> 05:35:23,780
Stay up for me, head to bed.

6632
05:35:23,860 --> 05:35:25,380
Because you deserve it.

6633
05:35:25,500 --> 05:35:26,620
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

6634
05:35:26,840 --> 05:35:27,460
Bye, guys.

6635
05:35:27,620 --> 05:35:27,980
Bye.
