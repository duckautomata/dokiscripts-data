1
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,350
Wow!

2
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:47,970
Hello everybody!

3
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,470
Wait, let me put up my lo-fi.

4
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,110
I have like 20 tabs up right now.

5
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:53,870
Give me a sec.

6
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,870
Alright, here we go.

7
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:57,750
Lo-fi!

8
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:58,710
Yay!

9
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,390
Now we're actually comfy!

10
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,250
Let's go!

11
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,970
Oh, today was a very long day today.

12
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,030
We're so close to 700k!

13
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,830
I don't think we're getting it at the end of the stream, but I just thought...

14
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,330
It'd be nice to have it there.

15
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,670
It'd just be nice to...

16
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,930
To have the counter there.

17
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:23,930
Nice, yeah.

18
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,210
But what a long, exhausting day we had today.

19
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,430
Yeah, we sort of...

20
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,630
We sort of low-key overdid it today in terms of streaming.

21
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,670
I don't know what it is about Overwatch.

22
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:43,110
Something about Overwatch just makes me go like crazy.

23
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:45,450
Oh yeah!

24
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:46,630
I didn't realize!

25
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,090
You guys know like the alpha test for Marvel Rivals?

26
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,590
For Marvel Rivals is actually like...

27
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,210
It's coming out next week?

28
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:57,970
I think?

29
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,930
I think it's next week, right?

30
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,510
Yeah, it's coming out on Friday.

31
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,670
The alpha test.

32
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,990
I actually didn't realize that.

33
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,330
That's crazy.

34
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,590
I noticed... I just saw... I saw like...

35
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,630
Because I was like... I made the joke about like...

36
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:11,370
Oh, this is going to be like Marvel Rivals waiting room.

37
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,430
By the way...

38
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,630
Fucking shitty name.

39
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:18,270
It's a really bad name.

40
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,950
I'll admit.

41
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,730
Marvel Rivals.

42
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,810
It just doesn't...

43
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,530
I think it's because like...

44
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,830
It just doesn't roll off the tongue very well.

45
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,930
Marvel Rivals...

46
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,750
It feels like a tongue twister.

47
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:31,310
You know?

48
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,370
Marvel Rivals, Marvel Rivals...

49
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,210
It just feels like...

50
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,030
Feels like a fucking tongue twister.

51
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,730
Not like...

52
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:37,990
It's like, you know, Apex Legends.

53
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:39,210
Overwatch.

54
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,510
Fortnite.

55
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,350
Like, these are things that roll off your tongue.

56
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,190
Very easily.

57
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,350
But Marvel Rivals is such a terrible name.

58
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,150
For...

59
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,230
It's such a terrible name.

60
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,070
For a game title.

61
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:53,410
Um...

62
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,230
It just sounds really mad.

63
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,350
I wish it was a different name.

64
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,290
Uh...

65
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,510
But I signed up...

66
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,770
I signed up for like the alpha test.

67
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,010
But it says like they're...

68
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,230
I was reading it up.

69
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:07,450
And it said that they're planning on taking in 30,000 people.

70
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:08,790
Uh...

71
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,210
30,000 people.

72
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,510
Uh...

73
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,010
For the alpha test.

74
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,550
So like, if any...

75
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,670
You know, if anybody has any connections to...

76
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:20,990
Um...

77
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:31,090
All I'm saying is that if anybody has any connections to NetEase or like the developers of Marvel Rivals and you know, you guys could like sneak me in.

78
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,570
So like I can...

79
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,870
You know, I can do like a play through test.

80
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,350
You know?

81
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:35,970
I can...

82
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,570
I can give you guys content.

83
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:38,530
Publicity.

84
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,530
I could give you publicity.

85
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:41,490
I could give you publicity.

86
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,010
Chat.

87
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:42,770
Like...

88
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:45,770

91
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,370
Any Marvel Rivals devs in chat?

00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,370
I signed up.

96
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:58,770
Deadpool.

97
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,690
Thank you for the super chat.

98
00:04:59,730 --> 00:04:59,990
Thank you.

99
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:00,350
Thank you.

100
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,850
There was no toxicity in Overwatch.

101
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,130
Just like there's no war in Ba Sing Se.

102
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:04,630
Thank you.

103
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:05,110
Super chat.

104
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:05,450
Thank you.

105
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:05,830
Thank you.

106
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,650
Oh my god.

107
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,710
Um...

108
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:08,690
I had a game.

109
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,050
It was actually fucking crazy.

110
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:10,390
It was...

111
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,370
It was so...

112
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:11,470
I had a game.

113
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,870
Holy shit!

114
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,190
I had it!

115
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:25,350
I had a game where there was a Reaper one trick on the enemy team and he was really fucking bad.

116
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:31,760
So then like, I think like one of our teammates called him out and was like...

117
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,970
Cause like the Mercy player on the enemy team was like...

118
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:37,850
This was off stream.

119
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,750
The Mercy player on the enemy team was like, report our Reaper.

120
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,950
He's trolling.

121
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,710
And then the Reaper was like, no report our Mercy.

122
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,070
She's like pistolling from spawn.

123
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:52,330
And one of the teammates on my team was like...

124
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,550
Bro, not gonna lie.

125
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,910
You're pretty... You're not gonna lie.

126
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,890
You're a pretty bad player.

127
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,030
Like, that's the Reaper one trick.

128
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,770
And he was like...

129
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,650
The person on my team was like, you know, we should all report the...

130
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,730
He was like in the all chat, you know, we should report you for being a terrorist.

131
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,190
You're a terrible player.

132
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,470
And then...

133
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:17,370
And then, okay, and then it escalated because the teammate...

134
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,790
My teammate was like, you should kill him.

135
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,270
I was like...

136
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:25,250
I was like, weekly!

137
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:35,350
And then the enemy Reaper straight up dropped a gamer word.

138
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,270
Holy shit!

139
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,440
Holy shit!

140
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:43,960
Holy shit!

141
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,500
And then...

142
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:50,180
And then the enemy, the Reaper one trick straight up was like, gamer word.

143
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,220
Everyone

144
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,840
in all chat was straight up was like, whoa!

145
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,380
Like, both were bad.

146
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:09,880
But one was worse than the other because I can't say the gamer word.

147
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,860
So obviously I reported the gamer word Reaper one trick.

148
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,180
And I got...

149
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,560
I got the report be like, thank you for reporting on this person.

150
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,860
We have banned them.

151
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,100
And you know, you know, they're so used to...

152
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:43,060
They're so used to dropping that shit because they knew exactly how to censor that word in a way that it showed up in chat.

153
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,740
Not once, but twice.

154
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,580
Because usually it would be censored in asterisks.

155
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:57,560
But this guy knew exactly how to type it so that it would show up and we could see exactly what that word was.

156
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,840
And all of us were just like, whoa!

157
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,640
It was fucking crazy.

158
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,140
Uh, bye.

159
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,060
Thank you for the super chat.

160
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,340

162
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,600

171

Yeah.

179
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,140
So Overwatch is like...

180
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,040
It's a very...

181
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,420
It's a very interesting game.

182
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,480
But yeah, I'm...

183
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,280
I hope I get into...

184
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,020
Red, thank you for the super chat.

185
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,300
Thank you.

186
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:35,760
Thank you.

187
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,580
I hope I get into the alpha test because I would love to try it out.

188
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:41,700
Um...

189
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,920
It'll be very exciting.

190
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:43,320
But yeah.

191
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,520
Next week is gonna be...

192
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,920
I know I said next week was supposed to be the rest week.

193
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,580
But next week is gonna be a very interesting week for me.

194
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,140
Yeah.

195
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:54,940
It's...

196
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,140
It's gonna...

197
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,680
You guys will see in the schedule soon of why.

198
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,960
Why it'll be a very interesting week for me.

199
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:04,980
But it's...

200
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,700
It's a lot.

201
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,760
It's a lot of stuff.

202
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,380
I still haven't figured out my party animals team as well.

203
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,240
I was supposed to figure it out by today.

204
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,440
But I asked...

205
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,840
I'm gonna give them the...

206
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,920
I'm gonna figure it out tomorrow.

207
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,300
So, we'll see.

208
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,980
It's supposed to be today but then...

209
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,140
Maybe they'll let me wait until tomorrow.

210
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,360
Is that good?

211
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,080
Thank you for the super chat!

212
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,320
Thank you!

213
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:30,700
Thank you!

214
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,480
Congrats on master!

215
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,520
Thank you for the super chat!

216
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:32,800
Thank you!

217
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,320
Thank you!

218
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,200
Thank you!

219
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:34,760
Thank you for the super chat!

220
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,040
Thank you!

221
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,420
Thank you!

222
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,300
Happy at least elimination day, Doki.

223
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:37,880
What does that mean?

224
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,240
Thank you for the super chat!

225
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:39,560
Thank you!

226
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,140
Thank you!

227
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,420
Um...

228
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,220
I'm also like...

229
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:48,340
Okay, also by the way, should I resize myself smaller for Overwatch streams?

230
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,880
I noticed like, am I too big on the screen guys?

231
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,080
Do you think I should be smaller?

232
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,960
I was worried that I cover up too much of the gameplay.

233
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,840
So if I ever do another Overwatch stream...

234
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,400
ZECO THANK YOU FOR THE 50 GIFTED CHIPS!

235
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,560
THANK YOU, THANK YOU!

236
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,700
I like big, Doki.

237
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,980
No, bigger.

238
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,460
Full body left side.

239
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,920
Guys, you won't be able to see the HP on the left side.

240
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,480
Yeah, that head is huge.

241
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,100
That's where my brain goes.

242
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,860
Yeah, I can make it a little... I'll make it a little bit smaller.

243
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,400
I don't know if I'll ever do an Overwatch stream.

244
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:35,860
Again, maybe I'll just do like a stream where I just play... just get top 500 and that's it.

245
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,520
I don't have no plans on ending top 500.

246
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,600
Because the reward system...

247
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,880
For Overwatch... for Overwatch is just not...

248
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,400
It's just not like something I care.

249
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,760
The rankings are really fun.

250
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,780
Doki, thank you for the magenta soup!

251
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,260
Thank you, thank you!

252
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,700
Yeah, I just play to have fun.

253
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,840
I don't really care about rank anymore.

254
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,060
I just think like... I just think like the reward...

255
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,980
If the rewards were worth it, I'd definitely play more.

256
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,620
But the rewards was 100% not worth it at all.

257
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,200
Haha!

258
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,740
It's just... it just... it just was like... it's not... it's like... it's like some fucking...

259
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:17,620
What was it?

260
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,100
It was... it's like the tagline that lasts for one season.

261
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,060
Like I don't care.

262
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,140
I don't care about that.

263
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:29,760
I don't care about... if it was forever like the icon is raised, then I care a little bit more.

264
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,780
But the fact that it's just like a tagline that only lasts for one season is just not worth it.

265
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,960
Not so Deadpool!

266
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,760
Thank you for the super chat!

267
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,560
Thank you, thank you!

268
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,460
I want Doki so big we can see the tomato inside.

269
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,820
Thank you for the super chat.

270
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,840
Thank you... thank you!

271
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,000
songs Let's see.

272
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,900
It's only the tagline.

273
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,860
So when you get top 500 in Overwatch 2...

274
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:04,000
You get like this tagline that just says top 500 Challenger something that like shows people that you ended in top 500.

275
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,640
But if you lose it after one season, so they go away and that's it.

276
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,200
That's it!

277
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:10,260
That's it.

278
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,000
I was like, I don't care.

279
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:11,820
I don't care.

280
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,380
If it goes away, like, what's the- what the fuck's the point, you know?

281
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:32,080
So like I don't mind just touching top 500 on stream because usually in the past I never stream my rank sessions because when I get like super serious or like barely, when I get super serious in rank I don't stream my rank sessions because I cannot fo- like,

282
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:42,040
you know, I talk to you guys and play at the same time So, you know damn well I am not focused at all When am I playing on stream?

283
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:54,360
But when I play off stream, I play off stream, of course I'm like super focused and I actually like pay attention to my surroundings and everything.

284
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,560
Any plans on more Apex?

285
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,580
ALGS got me high.

286
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,300
I haven't watched ALGS this season.

287
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:12,280
Honestly, I think if I asked for like drops on my Twitch account, they would give it to me but like I I honestly like I usually watch during I watch for like the finals like the finals finalists.

288
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,720
This is like what is it?

289
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,200
What is it called?

290
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:36,880
It's uh split one, so I'm not like as like Also, I haven't done a watch-along of it so And like I'm honestly like I'm just waiting for I'm just waiting for like the new update because for the new legend and everything um Only thing is Yeah,

291
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,400
no thought head empty.

292
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,260
Thank you for the super chat.

293
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:44,540
Thank you.

294
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:44,880
Thank you.

295
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,880
So if you're a tomato and thief, doesn't that make you a kleptomato?

296
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:48,960
Grats on masters.

297
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:49,640
Thank you.

298
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,780
Thank you for the super chat.

299
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,200
Thank you.

300
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,780
I really appreciate it.

301
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,740
Thank you so much.

302
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,000
Uh, Splatoon 3.

303
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,240
No.

304
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,820
Splatoon has made me the most toxic person ever.

305
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,920
Because in Splatoon, you can't talk to anybody.

306
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:08,160
So you can't verbalize your hatred for your teammates.

307
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:08,900
Uh...

308
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:19,100
So, Splatoon has been the game that made me the most toxic I can ever be in rank.

309
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,900
And it's also really tilting because it's on Nintendo...

310
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,500
It's on Nintendo servers.

311
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,100
And Nintendo is not great with latency and stuff.

312
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,780
And because of that...

313
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,760
Like, um...

314
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,240
Connections are fucking terrible as well.

315
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,920
And like, so when somebody DCs, it's just losable.

316
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,960
And you don't even get like rank protection or anything.

317
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,360
And I just fucking hate Nintendo servers.

318
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,800
Like, I just don't understand why the latency can be so bad.

319
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:50,660
I don't understand.

320
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,320
Like, you have so much money.

321
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,660
What do you do with your money?

322
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:54,820
Like...

323
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,980
Thank you for the super chat.

324
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,300
Thank you.

325
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:58,740
Thank you.

326
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,680
I was watching your Overwatch stream from my TV at work today.

327
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,760
So then I got stuck doing it.

328
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,780
I was doing paperwork so you can cover as much of the hunt as you want.

329
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,560
Thank you for the magenta soup.

330
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,320
Thank you.

331
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:08,980
Thank you.

332
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,700
I was very toxic.

333
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,280
I would actually like slam things if I lose.

334
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,480
And like, I would...

335
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,080
Oh my god.

336
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,600
I was...

337
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,560
It was so bad.

338
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,280
It was so bad for Splatoon.

339
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,100
And the player base for like Splatoon is also like not that high.

340
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,040
Like you would think Overwatch player base is pretty bad.

341
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,660
But Splatoon player base is absolutely terrible.

342
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,180
Because majority of the players are in Japan.

343
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,640
And like the NA players are like...

344
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,000
Yeah.

345
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,240
Never.

346
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,360
It's all in Asia.

347
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,240
So like the connection is like even more terrible.

348
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,420
But like they'll never...

349
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,800
Nintendo is just too big to fail.

350
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,960
I don't know why we always go back to Nintendo.

351
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,120
But...

352
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,100
It doesn't matter what they do.

353
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,860
The moment they release something remotely nostalgia bait.

354
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,760
People just forget everything.

355
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,040
They...

356
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,720
If Nintendo one day does something so terrible that like...

357
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,340
People actually start boycotting.

358
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:29,600
All they have to do is just release the new Smash Bros or a new Zelda game.

359
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,100
That's...

360
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,980
That's really it.

361
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,160
Like they don't have to do anything.

362
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,360
They don't need to do anything.

363
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,540
Everything is forgive...

364
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,280
I...

365
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,060
Okay someone says everything is forgiven by the next direct.

366
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:50,920
I...

367
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,160
I'm so sad.

368
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,240
I miss E3.

369
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,420
I miss...

370
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,780
I miss E3.

371
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,760
E3 was so fucking hyped.

372
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,800
I love all the...

373
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,120
I love...

374
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:06,940
I wish we could just... I wish E3 was still going on so we can do like watch-alongs of E3.

375
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,740
I miss... like those were so fucking hype.

376
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:14,400
And even if like some... like some of you were like, yeah, but the recent shows were so cringe.

377
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,580
That's the best part!

378
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,780
When it's cringe and you can make fun of it.

379
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,740
Like Summer Game Fest, it's not the same.

380
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,460
It's not the same.

381
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,000
Even the booths were so good too.

382
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,780
The booths on E3 presentations were so good as well.

383
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,380
It's just not the same.

384
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,540
E3 cringe was amazing!

385
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,760
Exactly!

386
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,220
Even with the... but then you were like, what about the Gamer Awards?

387
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,940
The Gamer Awards... oh my god, bro.

388
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:53,620
The Gamer Awards is not... it's just... it's just not... it's just trailers.

389
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,680
It's just game trailers.

390
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,980
There's no like performances or anything.

391
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,700
Other than the music performances and stuff.

392
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,740
Not every game company is doing their own fucking direct.

393
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,340
Because Nintendo did it first and then everybody else copied it.

394
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,760
But it's so... I'm gonna say it.

395
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,880
The Nintendo Direct is so boring!

396
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,280
It's not... it's not hype anymore.

397
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,920
It's so boring!

398
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,720
Remember when like... wait, it was the robot chicken?

399
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,700
Oh my god!

400
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:27,980
Remember when like...

401
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:27,980
wait, it was the robot chicken?

402
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,840
Remember when like... wait, it was the robot chicken?

403
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:28,840
Oh my god!

404
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:28,840
Remember when like...

405
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:28,840
wait, it was the robot chicken?

406
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,780
Remember when like Nintendo did the robot chicken thing?

407
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:32,460
Remember when like Nintendo did the robot chicken thing?

408
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,500
Was that E3?

409
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,300
Or was that like...

410
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,900
A different one.

411
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,180
That shit was so funny!

412
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,360
It was so good, too!

413
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,780
And now, Direct's just so...

414
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:44,860
And now, Direct's just so...

415
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,180
Yeah!

416
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,740
E3 inspectors 2013!

417
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,060
Bro, for those who didn't realize...

418
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,400
E3 did like...

419
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:02,360
Back when Nintendo still participated in E3, they did a robot chicken parody.

420
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:09,460
I felt like, honestly, not gonna lie, I feel like Nintendo was much more chill back then compared to now.

421
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,960
I think compared to now, they're definitely more harsh and strict with things.

422
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,320
Oh yeah, the Muppets too!

423
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,940
The Muppets won!

424
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,720
They were so good at publicity back then.

425
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,680
I don't know what happened.

426
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,700
I feel like now they're much more strict.

427
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,780
Red, thank you for the super chat!

428
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,140
Thank you!

429
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,100
Not just Reggie, but other stuff too.

430
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,460
I mean, it makes sense because the guy is run by...

431
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,220
Nintendo America is run by the guy named Bowser.

432
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,720
Right?

433
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,480
Yeah, Iwata-san too.

434
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,140
I feel like they were much more...

435
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,000
chill back then compared to now.

436
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,660
Ummm...

437
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,400
I'm trying to remember, like.

438
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,920
Yeah, I don't, I'm not a huge fan of...

439
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,320
I'm not a huge fan of game companies.

440
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,580
Doing... GAME COMPANIES doing like...

441
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,240
Like, their own presentations, because it feels less hype.

442
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,540
I'm not hype about game releases these days.

443
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,120
Especially when everybody just leaks what they're saying.

444
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:28,400
And usually like, you don't...

445
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:35,480
Because everything gets leaked now that you don't get hyped over a game release when it just shows up out of nowhere.

446
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,020
You know?

447
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:46,080
Like world premieres and stuff like when nothing was ever said about the certain game and then suddenly you find out on E3 alone.

448
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,180
And everyone was like, Wow!

449
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:47,360
Wow!

450
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:57,610
Now you know everything that's gonna come out.

451
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,930
Times were simpler.

452
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:16,470
Yeah.

453
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,830
Everything was so much more simpler back then.

454
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:24,870
Now I feel like... now games are... game releases are not as hyped anymore.

455
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,810
I don't know.

456
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:28,990
I mean we do have like a lot of indie games and stuff.

457
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:35,270
Indie games are now... now like more popular than like AAA games and everything.

458
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,890
Because like they get to make whatever they want to make.

459
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:45,430
And they're not governed by the corporate executive board that was like, no you should change that and this.

460
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:48,690
So a lot of indie game devs are just doing whatever the fuck they want.

461
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:49,810
And not having...

462
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:54,850
not having to worry about trying to fit into whatever the exec wants.

463
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,810
But indie games don't really make a lot of...

464
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:03,090
Indie games don't really make multiplayer FPS games.

465
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:13,410
Where are the developers making games for me?

466
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,890
For me!

467
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,230
I don't wanna...

468
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,390
I don't wanna play single player games.

469
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:26,810
I wanna play multiplayer FPS games.

470
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,290
That I can solo queue.

471
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:34,190
So I don't have to look for play collab partners.

472
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:35,410
Haha.

473
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,230
Red thank you for the super chat.

474
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:37,690
Thank you.

475
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,310
Thank you.

476
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,650
It's just...

477
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:43,630
All we have is just Apex and Overwatch.

478
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:44,990
Hahaha.

479
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:45,950
Hahaha.

480
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:50,570
Um...

481
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,810
I was gonna say...

482
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:53,450
Oh yeah!

483
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,450
You guys hear about Helldivers 2?

484
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:56,890
Haha.

485
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,930
Fucking rest in peace that game died.

486
00:22:59,410 --> 00:22:59,930
Hahaha.

487
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:02,830
It's too late.

488
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,910
They can't do anything to save...

489
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,190
They can't...

490
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,390
They can't do anything to...

491
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:09,450
To...

492
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,090
To save the game now.

493
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,170
Lucky for them.

494
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,190
Lucky for them.

495
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,670
EDF is coming out too.

496
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:16,990
So...

497
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,510
Yeah.

498
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,570
It's already over.

499
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:20,650
The moment...

500
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,030
Oh what happened?

501
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:22,710
Um...

502
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,390
Basically...

503
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,490
They made you...

504
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,950
Required to have a...

505
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,190
PlayStation account.

506
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:32,510
To link your PlayStation account...

507
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,970
To Helldivers 2.

508
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,330
Even though it's on Steam.

509
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,530
People didn't like that cause there's extra steps.

510
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,430
Hahaha.

511
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,730
Wait Steam is actually giving refunds to people?

512
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,330
Oh thank god Valve.

513
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,990
Thank god Gabe.

514
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,590
Gabe always knows what's...

515
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,910
Gabe has to have like...

516
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:52,130
The fucking best...

517
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,230
Like publicity...

518
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,230
PR team...

519
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,270
In the fucking world.

520
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,990
Cause he's a true gamer.

521
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,150
Gabe is a real fucking gamer.

522
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,470
And I'll be so sad...

523
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,230
If Valve ever goes...

524
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,230
Gets on the stock market.

525
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,210
And gets an executive board.

526
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:06,770
Because...

527
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,570
That's when everything will go downhill.

528
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:09,710
Uh...

529
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,010
Hahaha.

530
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:11,310
Hahaha.

531
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:12,730
Hahaha.

532
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,710
Deadpool thank you for the super chat.

533
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,050
Thank you.

534
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,390
Thank you.

535
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:16,470
Gente...

536
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,910
Don't shoot my baby like this...

537
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:18,950
You can still walk it back.

538
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:19,270
Oh...

539
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,170
Somebody's coping.

540
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:21,410
Looky that...

541
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:21,790
For...

542
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:22,710
Poor Fuu...

543
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,090
Fu...

544
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,810
Coping that they can return from this.

545
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,770
You know...

546
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,010
Okay gamers do forget.

547
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,030
But like...

548
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,710
The thing about gamers...

549
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,690
Is that you have to have a big enough...

550
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:34,610
Reputation...

551
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,790
You have to have something...

552
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,130
That will make gamers wanna come back to you.

553
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,050
But like...

554
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,710
I'm gonna say Helldivers 2...

555
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,490
I don't...

556
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:41,830
Like...

557
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,170
You gotta be like big enough...

558
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:43,870
Like Nintendo...

559
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,350
To be able to recover from this.

560
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:45,930
Like...

561
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:46,370
Hahaha

562
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:57,890
And Heldivish2 does not have that reputation, unfortunately.

563
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:06,370
I don't think Heldivish2 is...

564
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:10,370
The thing is, the thing is, the only way...

565
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:21,770
The only way I see Heldivish2 coming back from this is if Sony makes an apology.

566
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,670
And I don't think Sony is going to make an apology.

567
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:28,890
Call me.

568
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,210
Thank you for the super chat.

569
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:30,850
Thank you.

570
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:31,470
Thank you.

571
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,390
Truly the best PR strategy.

572
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,850
Do nothing and watch other companies make mistakes.

573
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,630
Thank you for the super chat.

574
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:38,330
Thank you.

575
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,250
Thank you.

576
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:43,510
I don't think they're going to apologize.

577
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,090
Let's see.

578
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,290
Razzy, thank you for the super chat.

579
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:56,710
Thank you.

580
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:57,310
Thank you.

581
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:02,110
They hung us away a lot because they actually have redeeming features.

582
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:07,210
Someone didn't look at the news recently.

583
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,630
I still love Nintendo though.

584
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:20,190
I guess it's because I still I'm just a consumer.

585
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:24,050
I'm just a consumer that's stuck in...

586
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:31,790
That's stuck because the properties they own are just too good to leave.

587
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,890
I do miss E3.

588
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:46,070
I think it's just like... I think like watching... doing watch-alongs of like...

589
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:50,690
like you know... like game announcements and game news just isn't the same.

590
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:51,810
Just isn't the same.

591
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,770
The memes are not as good too.

592
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,130
I think it's the memes.

593
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:59,210
The memes that come out of game announcements are just not good.

594
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:05,330
They're just so boring that people can't make memes out of it.

595
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:09,630
The only memes we got out of like game announcements were...

596
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:13,050
were the fucking... what was it?

597
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,750
The one with the kid fucking...

598
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,130
What's the word?

599
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:21,710
The kid just showed... a random kid just showed out of nowhere.

600
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:25,570
Just crashes the E3 and I see crashes the game awards.

601
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:29,190
That was like the only meme that came out of the game awards.

602
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:29,490
The game awards.

603
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:33,670
Corinne, thank you for the five.

604
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,270
Give the chips.

605
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:34,570
Thank you.

606
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:35,170
Thank you.

607
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,610
Swibbly, Sony apology.

608
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,150
We're sorry you felt this way.

609
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:39,330
Thank you for the super chat.

610
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:39,750
Thank you.

611
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:40,310
Thank you.

612
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,910
Nedverse, I don't even want to think about what happened.

613
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:43,730
The game goes.

614
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:44,870
Thank you for the super chat.

615
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:45,230
Thank you.

616
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:45,870
Thank you.

617
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,130
Um...

618
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,090
Oh yeah.

619
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,350
I'm trying to like...

620
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:55,730
I don't... what are some good games coming out too?

621
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:56,890
By the way guys.

622
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,670
Guys, you guys know what...

623
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,010
What are some of the...

624
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:03,130
What some of some good games are coming out soon?

625
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,030
I can't even...

626
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,030
I don't even...

627
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:09,830
I can't even like think of any good games coming out recently.

628
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,410
EDF?

629
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,510
Other than EDF.

630
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:13,810
EDF...

631
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,210
Uh...

632
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:16,550
Stock...

633
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,530
Oh, Silksong.

634
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:19,450
Sycopium.

635
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:26,390
I mean like the next couple of months guys.

636
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,410
The next couple of what months?

637
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,630
I guess someone was like...

638
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:31,450
Silksong.

639
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:32,210
Copium.

640
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,630
It's not...

641
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,410
It's not...

642
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:35,910
Cope!

643
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,750
Oh, Hades 2!

644
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:40,350
I'm so sad I didn't get into the beta test.

645
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:42,870
I wanted to get into the beta test for Hades 2.

646
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,990
And do like a sneak peak stream.

647
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,470
But like I couldn't...

648
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,930
I couldn't get into...

649
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,330
I couldn't get into the beta test.

650
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:52,490
But I wanted to try it out on stream.

651
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,210
Stellar Blade.

652
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,810
Yeah, but that's already out.

653
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,070
Dad, I'm thinking of the super chat.

654
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:57,370
Thank you.

655
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:57,690
Thank you.

656
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:58,390
System Shock 2.

657
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,130
Enhance the distance forever on the radar.

658
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,150
Thank you for the super chat.

659
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:01,530
Thank you.

660
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,090
Thank you.

661
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:02,890
Thank you.

662
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,170
Overwatch 3.

663
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,970
Yeah, I know Wukong is coming out.

664
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:08,630
But that's like...

665
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:09,870
Like quarter four.

666
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,470
What was it?

667
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:14,130
It's at the end of the...

668
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:16,150
The end of the quarter or something.

669
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:21,830
So it's gonna be a while before...

670
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:24,130
It's gonna be a while before...

671
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:26,950
Before it comes out.

672
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,260
So...

673
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,340
I don't know.

674
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:33,800
Titanfall 3.

675
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,400
I'm coping.

676
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,540
I don't know.

677
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,860
I can't think of like any...

678
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,600
Any good games that are gonna be coming out soon.

679
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,160
Chat.

680
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,600
Like how people were like...

681
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,180
Elden Ring.

682
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,580
Elden Ring DLC.

683
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,800
Guys, I haven't played Elden Ring.

684
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,980
Dragon Ball Z Sparkling Zero.

685
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,260
Is that a...

686
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,860
Is that a...

687
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:57,160
Okay.

688
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,980
Dragon Ball Z Sparkling Zero.

689
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,160
Is that a fighting game?

690
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,440
Or an adventure game?

691
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,200
Is that a fighting game?

692
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,220
For Dragon Ball Z?

693
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,760
Because that's basically a majority of Dragon Ball Z games.

694
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,080
Oh, it is.

695
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:16,540
Okay.

696
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,640
Okay.

697
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,640
I...

698
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:19,760
Almost shit.

699
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,340
I wish...

700
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,660
I said it before in the Sandland playthrough.

701
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,680
But I wish...

702
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,100
I really do wish they make other types of adaptations.

703
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,480
Of anime games.

704
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,400
That's not just fighting games.

705
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,480
There's so much lore to it.

706
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,540
You know why?

707
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,680
You know why?

708
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,500
It's because they need to get this shit out fast.

709
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,200
Before like anime...

710
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,500
The anime series dies.

711
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,680
Like that's the thing.

712
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,840
They're so scared.

713
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,820
It's the easiest.

714
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,920
Yeah, it's one of the easiest.

715
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,200
They're so scared that the hype is gonna die out.

716
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,240
Um...

717
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,540
That hype is gonna die out.

718
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,640
That they always make like fucking fighting games.

719
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,560
I'm not talking about Dragon Ball Z.

720
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,400
Because it makes sense.

721
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,580
Dragon Ball Z.

722
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,620
Uh...

723
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,240
Fighting games makes sense.

724
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,580
But there's like games that just doesn't fucking make sense.

725
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,960
It just...

726
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,580
It just doesn't make sense.

727
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,980
And it's...

728
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,680
Then they're like...

729
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,340
Sometimes they're fucking terrible too.

730
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,660
I don't...

731
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,140
I don't get it.

732
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:21,740
Um...

733
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,420
And it's like...

734
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,400
Because it's easy to make.

735
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,180
And it's like...

736
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,160
It's cheaper.

737
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,320
And it's also like...

738
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,280
You want to get in.

739
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,760
You want to get in on the hype before it's over.

740
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,560
And uh...

741
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,220
And like there's so many...

742
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,220
It's crazy.

743
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:36,680
I...

744
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,240
The thing I hate about like how anime series...

745
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,900
Anime series goes...

746
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,040
Is that...

747
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,820
People...

748
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,760
They're so scared about losing hype.

749
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:52,720
That like some of the anime shows don't even have time to like sink in for people.

750
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,340
That by the next season...

751
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,140
Like the next like...

752
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:56,560
It was like...

753
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,760
Oh winter, spring, fall, summer rolls out.

754
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,460
Like it's forget it.

755
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,620
Like people forget about it.

756
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:06,880
There's so many animes that are releasing almost every season.

757
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:12,840
That like it's so hard for any show to even like build an audience.

758
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:13,860
And I hate it.

759
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:17,700
Like every season like 40 plus animes get released.

760
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,100
It's so competitive.

761
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,240
It's all hype based.

762
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:20,520
Yeah.

763
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,000
And then the moment...

764
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,400
The moment the season of it ends.

765
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,860
People forget about it.

766
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,280
It's over.

767
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,040
Hahaha.

768
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,320
Like...

769
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:29,740
Like...

770
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,220
Like I hate it.

771
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:36,000
Because it doesn't even build up the fan base of like...

772
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,800
It doesn't build up the fan base of people.

773
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,540
Yeah the market saturations and stuff like that.

774
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,380
There's so many types of animes like that.

775
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,700
Unless you're probably like the big fucking four or something.

776
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,200

I don't...

786
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,540
I've never played any of the Yakuza games.

787
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,900
But they're so so long.

788
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,500
I know because like my dad played the Yakuza games.

789
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,020
And um...

790
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,580
And like it took him fucking...

791
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,740
I don't even know if he beat it.

792
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,360
It took him fucking forever.

793
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,840
He doesn't play it anymore.

794
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,140
So I assume he beat it.

795
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,840
But it's a very very long game.

796
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:18,860

Thank you.

829
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:55,620
Um I just think like uh I just feel like...

830
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,200
I feel like...

831
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,080
I feel like...

832
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,320
People really should...

833
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,160
Slow down with the anime releases.

834
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,040
Like just space them out more.

835
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,500
Because there's apparently I like I don't watch a lot of anime.

836
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,880
Um because I don't have time to read subtitles.

837
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:13,100
Well uh I don't have time to read subtitles while playing.

838
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,420
Um while doing work or playing something.

839
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,180
So I don't watch a lot of anime.

840
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,940
But I've always heard how how like people would be like.

841
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,660
Oh man this this anime show was so underrated.

842
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,500
And people already forgot about it.

843
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,280
And if someone was like bro when that was this anime.

844
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,580
When X insert X anime got released.

845
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:35,840
Um it was like that one the most hype anime is out there.

846
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,180
But people already forgot about it.

847
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,820
Because there's so many animes that's being released almost every season.

848
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:48,020
That like um even really good ones get like like forgotten and stuff.

849
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:52,060
Like I feel like a lot of people already forgot about.

850
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:57,640
What was it the the one with all the animals as like students students or something.

851
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,260
God what's that anime called?

852
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,300
I already forgot.

853
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,840
Remember when like um I got reincarnated as a slime.

854
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,680
That shit was like one of the biggest show anime.

855
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,560
Yeah Beastars.

856
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,760
I feel like Beastars is already people already forgot about Beastars.

857
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,980
But when that anime came out.

858
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,400
So many people were like so hyped about it.

859
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,380
And like like talked about it all everywhere.

860
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,140
And then like it died out.

861
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,720
And then there was what was it?

862
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,240
And then there was that fucking other anime.

863
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,580
With reincarnated as a slime.

864
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,720
No one really talks about that anymore.

865
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,940
Slime is literally airing right now.

866
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,540
Yeah but no one talks about it like the time when it first came out.

867
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:43,140
And there was that other one with the spider.

868
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,220
Remember that fucking anime reincarnated as a spider?

869
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,320
That one.

870
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,620
No one talks about it anymore.

871
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,860
Because after the first season.

872
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,960
Unless you're like big big.

873
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,840
So it's like I did not even know there was a new season.

874
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,620
And then but we don't talk about one punch man.

875
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,260
One punch man like fucking like shot itself in the foot.

876
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,220
Like that's on them.

877
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,840
And then did you guys know?

878
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,160
I don't even know if it came up.

879
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,200
Blue exorcist.

880
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,600
Oh my god.

881
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,840
All I'm saying.

882
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,440
That when blue exorcist first came out.

883
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,300
That was not gonna lie.

884
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:40,440
I feel like blue exorcist was like one of the fujo bait anime's out there.

885
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,380
Bro everybody loved that shit.

886
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:49,740
Like.

887
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,480
And that was the show.

888
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,020
And then when it ended.

889
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,820
Nobody cared.

890
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:07,540
And now nobody cared after it ended and stuff.

891
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,100
And then apparently.

892
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,500
Apparently it's getting a new season.

893
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,600
It's getting.

894
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,460
Isn't it?

895
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,520
It's getting a new season right?

896
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,360
Or did it air?

897
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,660
Did it already aired?

898
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,360
Did it already aired?

899
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,020
Like.

900
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:27,980
Yeah.

901
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,400
They made.

902
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,340
Stop making up for it.

903
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:31,960
Fake shows.

904
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:32,460
Yeah.

905
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:32,720
No.

906
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,360
It is airing.

907
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,980
Nobody cares now.

908
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,900
No one talks about blue exorcist.

909
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:42,820
Even though like it was one of the fucking shows of.

910
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,640
Of like.

911
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,800
Um.

912
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,000
The show of the season.

913
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,800
And now it has a new season.

914
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,620
It got a revival.

915
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,840
And people were like.

916
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,800
Are like.

917
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,920
Oh my god.

918
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,920
Nobody cares.

919
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:56,900
Oh yeah.

920
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:57,560
And then there's free.

921
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,120
Holy fuck.

922
00:37:59,160 --> 00:37:59,380
No.

923
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,320
If I say blue exorcist was fujo bait.

924
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,360
Fucking free was fujo bait as hell.

925
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,420
Because like.

926
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,880
At least Yuri on ice.

927
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,380
Like it's implied that they got together.

928
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,840
Free they're just all really really good friends.

929
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:14,660
Like.

930
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:22,100
Yuri on ice at least it's implied.

931
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,720
But free it was just.

932
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,800
They're just homies.

933
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,680
But like.

934
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,680
People can dream.

935
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,080
Yeah.

936
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:30,880
Friends.

937
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,800
They were dating in my heart.

938
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,400
They're just best buds.

939
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,300
Free is and they were roommates.

940
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,320
The anime.

941
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,480
They're just really really good friends and roommates.

942
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,300
I don't know what you're implying.

943
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,300
I'm getting married in Yuri on ice.

944
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:54,820
Yeah.

945
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,560
And apparently they.

946
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,580
Oh my gosh.

947
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,760
I don't know if you guys heard about the controversy of.

948
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,440
Uh.

949
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,260
Yuri on ice.

950
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,240
But like.

951
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,720
They recently cancelled the movie.

952
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,420
Like officially cancelled the movie.

953
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,420
And like.

954
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,240
Some fucking.

955
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,780
I saw like people were like.

956
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,060
You know.

957
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,900
Reacting very negatively about it.

958
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,440
Because like.

959
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,780
Yuri on ice is like.

960
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:12,520
Um.

961
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,740
Is like.

962
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,100
Was.

963
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,760
Has a very like deep underground fandom.

964
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,380
Now it's like has a cult following at that point.

965
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,620
Because it's been like forever since they made new content for it.

966
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,260
And like apparently like remember I was reading on Twitter.

967
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,540
Because it was trending on Twitter.

968
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,320
And people were saying like.

969
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,380
People were like.

970
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:31,640
Oh.

971
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:32,520
Um.

972
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,360
There's some behind the scenes shenanigans.

973
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,400
As to why Yuri on ice was cancelled.

974
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,600
And I was like.

975
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,920
What the fuck is going on?

976
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,220
People were like.

977
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:45,980
People were like.

978
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:49,980
The director of some behind the scenes shenanigans.

979
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,960
As to why we never got Yuri on ice the movie.

980
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,060
The conspiracies.

981
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,020
Yeah.

982
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,300
The conspiracies.

983
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,440
Um.

984
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,060
Um.

985
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,800
Never black butter aired too.

986
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,380
Oh yeah!

987
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,320
They fucking remade Black Butler!

988
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,520
Or the new season.

989
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,080
I don't know.

990
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,220
Can you think of the super chat thing?

991
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:12,620
And they didn't care.

992
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,540
No one cares!

993
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,000
It's actually crazy.

994
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,960
That no one really like talked about the Black Butler shit.

995
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,520
Two.

996
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,680
There's just so many things that like.

997
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,580
Like there's so many animates and stuff that comes out.

998
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,100
Wait Beastars was the anime?

999
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,280
I thought it was an anime.

1000
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,960
Thank you for the super chat.

1001
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,300
Thank you.

1002
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:31,900
Thank you.

1003
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,240
Yeah, they did.

1004
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:39,120
They aired a new anime for Black Butler.

1005
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,880
But people just glossed over it.

1006
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:50,060
It's just... every season, only one or two animes are like the biggest things ever.

1007
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:54,140
And if you're not... and they fit the two anime, like the biggest...

1008
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:56,140
Like for like... oh, like summer anime.

1009
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,000
The summer anime is... insert anime here.

1010
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,680
And there can only be two.

1011
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,860
I feel like.

1012
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,060
I feel like there can only be two.

1013
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:08,720
And then even though there's like other animes that might be really, really fucking good.

1014
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:13,340
If they meet the quota of two, then it's over.

1015
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,260
People don't care.

1016
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,140
It's just... it's just forgotten.

1017
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:29,320
It could be like really, really fucking good too.

1018
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,780
But it doesn't matter.

1019
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,020
They already met their quota of two good animes.

1020
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:45,720
There's only a... yeah, there's only a limited amount of attention that goes around.

1021
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,460
And oh my gosh.

1022
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,140
I tried... I tried to watch Oshinoko.

1023
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,960
I couldn't.

1024
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,580
I watched like two episodes.

1025
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,220
And I got depressed.

1026
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,120
Because I was like, this is too fucking real.

1027
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,360
I couldn't keep watching.

1028
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,440
I got so sad.

1029
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,840
This is too real.

1030
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:16,640
Oh yeah, they did a reboot of Shaman King 2.

1031
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,680
They did a reboot of Shaman...

1032
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,150
There's so many fucking reboots.

1033
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,680
Oh my gosh.

1034
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,120
I hated anime's name.

1035
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,240
Nostalgia baiting now.

1036
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,400
It's nostalgia baiting.

1037
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:27,820
Noooo.

1038
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,280
I thought we could get away with nostalgia baiting.

1039
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:31,740
Express.

1040
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,580
Thank you for the super chat.

1041
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:32,900
Thank you.

1042
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,340
Thank you.

1043
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,100
Happy May the 4th, emergevenge of the 5th from Australia.

1044
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:36,540
Doki.

1045
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:37,780
Is there any...

1046
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,020
Clone Troop...

1047
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:44,020
Trooper character, squad, legion, color, patterns that you like is your favorite?

1048
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:44,960
Thank you for the super chat.

1049
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:45,300
Thank you.

1050
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:45,820
Thank you.

1051
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,700
I don't know about Clone Troopers.

1052
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:49,980
But I want to be a Sith Lord.

1053
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,360
Because at least Sith Lords...

1054
00:42:53,240 --> 00:43:02,340
I remember you guys told me when we were playing that Star Wars game, you guys were like, uh, uh, if you are a Jedi, you have to be pure.

1055
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:06,880
And then when you guys told me like pure, I didn't, I was like, oh, okay, that makes sense.

1056
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,600
Cause you gotta be like, you know, a good person.

1057
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:11,580
And you guys were like, no, you can't even have a family.

1058
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,500
And I was like, oh my God.

1059
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:20,000
And it like registered like all Jedis are technically virgins.

1060
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,500
I was like...

1061
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:27,140
Yeah, they can't not even like a little...

1062
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:32,860
They can't even feel love.

1063
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:34,540
It's crazy.

1064
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,940
They're actual wizards.

1065
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:38,020
They can't even feel love.

1066
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:41,000
I was like, holy shit, bro.

1067
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:46,480
It literally like, not my Christian friendly channel.

1068
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:49,160
Except for that one guy.

1069
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:49,980
Who's like, oh, I'm a Christian.

1070
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:53,140
Who's like, who's race that needed to be repopulated.

1071
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,860
So they gave him the one exception.

1072
00:43:55,320 --> 00:44:00,440
And even then he has to like not love his family, which is so fucked up to think about.

1073
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,620
Like, voluntarily celibate.

1074
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,660
Yeah, you can't have any attachment.

1075
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:07,800
Why the fuck would you be a Jedi?

1076
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:08,980
Civilians are cooler.

1077
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,320
Civilians sound so much cooler because of that.

1078
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,420
Uh, Faye, thank you for the Akka soup.

1079
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,380
Bah, thank you.

1080
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,660
I mean, they can continue the bloodline.

1081
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:19,040
Jedis can't.

1082
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,920
I hope Spice and Wolf does the opposite since no one cared when it originally aired.

1083
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,280
And then people love this.

1084
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:26,320
So maybe the remake people will care from the start.

1085
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,040
Maybe I'm just going to sit and cope now.

1086
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:29,280
Thank you for the Akka soup.

1087
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,280
Thank you.

1088
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,080
Thank you.

1089
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,860
But they're evil, Doki.

1090
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,000
So?

1091
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:42,860
But they're rich though.

1092
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,120
And they can bang.

1093
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:48,820
I'm not going to lie.

1094
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:49,020
I'm not going to lie.

1095
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,340
How can they continue the bloodline?

1096
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,600
How can they get the ladies?

1097
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,740
They get the ladies.

1098
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:05,920
Um...

1099
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:07,700
Yeah.

1100
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,120
If evil, why hot?

1101
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:09,900
Exactly.

1102
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,940
I just think...

1103
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:14,460
But yeah, that's my rant about anime.

1104
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,020
Even though I don't watch a lot of anime in general.

1105
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,720
I just think it's dumb that...

1106
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:23,020
A lot of really, really well animated anime shows are forgotten.

1107
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:24,220
Because there's always...

1108
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,900
There's just too many being released.

1109
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,240
And there's always a quota.

1110
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:28,100
It's like...

1111
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,800
If there's more than two good anime being released.

1112
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:31,960
The third plus...

1113
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,420
Third, fourth, fifth, sixth good anime will not be noticed.

1114
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,640
Because people don't care enough.

1115
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:37,500
Uh...

1116
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,360
KJ, thank you.

1117
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,860
Welcome back to the tomato farm.

1118
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:40,660
Welcome back.

1119
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:42,540
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

1120
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:43,240
Thank you.

1121
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,560
Star Wars romance fanfics aren't counted because cooties counter the...

1122
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,180
The cool orients.

1123
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,120
Thank you for the super chat.

1124
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:49,440
Thank you.

1125
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:49,980
Thank you.

1126
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,180
Um...

1127
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,580
What other things do I want to talk about?

1128
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,560
I also don't like how...

1129
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,040
I hate...

1130
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:00,780
Okay.

1131
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,080
I hate binging...

1132
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,520
I hate shows that are supposed to be bingeable.

1133
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:05,740
Um...

1134
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:06,660
I think like...

1135
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:10,560
Series that you can binge in one sitting...

1136
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:14,520
Has killed our love for like shows.

1137
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,260
Because our...

1138
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:17,280
Because like...

1139
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,320
We forget about them after it's over.

1140
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,000
Like...

1141
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:26,780
I think like binging shows is such a bad concept.

1142
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:28,300
Because...

1143
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,360
Uh...

1144
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:29,980
Uh...

1145
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:31,280
Because like...

1146
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,080
You know...

1147
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,560
You consume everything in one go.

1148
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,840
That there's no hype going...

1149
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:35,940
Yeah.

1150
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:36,780
It kills the hype.

1151
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,580
I honestly think it kills...

1152
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:39,540
Um...

1153
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,060
It kills the hype instantly.

1154
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,480
For like shows.

1155
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:45,800
And I really hate that culture in general now.

1156
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,800
Because like...

1157
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,260
So...

1158
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:50,580
Some really really good shows get forgotten so easily.

1159
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:53,840
That it's so hard to build any fan base in general.

1160
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:54,780
Um...

1161
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,020
If it's like really good.

1162
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:57,300
Um...

1163
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:00,900
And I think that's like one of the worst things right now with the binging con...

1164
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:01,320
Culture.

1165
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:02,800
Uh...

1166
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,220
By size.

1167
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,020
Thank you for the super chat.

1168
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:04,340
Thank you.

1169
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:04,860
Thank you.

1170
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,540
You're using your top 500 to count today.

1171
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,880
Remind me a question I want to ask.

1172
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:10,260
What do you consider your greatest achievement in video games is?

1173
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:17,160
Getting sponsored by my favorite games is like when...

1174
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:17,240
I'm not sure.

1175
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,700
I think my greatest achievement in video games...

1176
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:23,800
Because I spent so much money and time playing this game.

1177
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,720
And then when I get sponsored by them.

1178
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:26,800
They're paying me.

1179
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,160
So in the end.

1180
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:34,920
Like I made back the money I spent on that game.

1181
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:40,800
And so I...

1182
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,800
I think that's like my...

1183
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,400
I think that's like my greatest achievement.

1184
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:45,660
Because it's like...

1185
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:46,700
It's like I get paid back.

1186
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:47,100
You know?

1187
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,960
Like the money just comes back and more.

1188
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:49,640
Uh...

1189
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,820
Let me thank you for the 10 gift of chips.

1190
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:52,260
Thank you.

1191
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:52,860
Thank you.

1192
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:53,940
Uh...

1193
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:54,200
Yeah.

1194
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,200
The cash back strats.

1195
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:55,680
Exactly.

1196
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:57,240
Speaking of cash back strats.

1197
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,080
Have you guys heard about my Fortnite code?

1198
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:00,020
Uh...

1199
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:04,400
You can use my Fortnite creator code at DokiBird.

1200
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:05,220
Uh...

1201
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:07,260
Whenever you purchase anything on Fortnite.

1202
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:08,400
So...

1203
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,460
So like you know.

1204
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:13,360
So like you know.

1205
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:14,740
You're already gonna purchase something anyway.

1206
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:15,200
You know?

1207
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,260
You're already gonna purchase something.

1208
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,780
So you might as well like...

1209
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:17,940
You know?

1210
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,020
Use the creator code.

1211
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,900
The infinite money glitch.

1212
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:27,460
Oh my god.

1213
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:28,000
Okay.

1214
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:28,680
So...

1215
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:32,900
I don't remember who I was having this conversation with.

1216
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,340
I think I was like talking to somebody who knows like a Fortnite creator.

1217
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:39,340
And like they can literally...

1218
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:41,580
When Fortnite was like...

1219
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:44,560
When they were like at the peak of Fortnite content creation.

1220
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:46,200
Like as a Fortnite streamer.

1221
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,660
They literally made like...

1222
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,160
I think like...

1223
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:55,620
Five hundred thousand dollars per month.

1224
00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:00,220
Of the Fortnite creator code at its peak.

1225
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,220
I was like...

1226
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:09,780
Half a million dollars via Fortnite creator code.

1227
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,860
Back when Fortnite was at its fucking peak.

1228
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,040
I don't remember who the streamer was.

1229
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:15,840
It was not Ninja.

1230
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:16,820
Just so you guys know.

1231
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:17,540
It was not Ninja.

1232
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,380
It was not Ninjas.

1233
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:30,020
I'm pretty sure if it was Ninja, it would be a million dollars.

1234
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,940
A million.

1235
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,940
A million per month if it was Ninja.

1236
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:36,000
But like...

1237
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,580
It was some fucking Fortnite creator.

1238
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,980
Like a Fortnite streamer years ago.

1239
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:40,680
Years ago.

1240
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,840
They could like passively make 500 G's per month.

1241
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:45,440
And I was like...

1242
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,380
That is fucking insane.

1243
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:47,820
Insane.

1244
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:50,200
Like, oh my god.

1245
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:53,240
No wonder they stream at Fortnite every day.

1246
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,160
Bro, that shit...

1247
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,920
That shit makes...

1248
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:57,840
Bank!

1249
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,140
Holy shit!

1250
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,020
Yeah, passive income.

1251
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:03,320
Because there's a lot of little kids...

1252
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:07,920
using their mama and papa's credit cards to buy Fortnite skins.

1253
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:09,460
And...

1254
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,160
That shit says...

1255
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,560
That shit like makes so much money.

1256
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:16,160
Guys, I'm gonna...

1257
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,580
Well, the Fortnite hype is over.

1258
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:19,240
So...

1259
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,460
I'm sorry to say...

1260
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:23,340
But like...

1261
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,440
It's too late now.

1262
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:27,360
It's too late to start now, guys.

1263
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:30,480
It is!

1264
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:31,820
It's actually crazy!

1265
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,700
To be able to make that much...

1266
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:36,800
off of like one fucking month?

1267
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:38,260
Oh my god!

1268
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,420
The Fortnite hype is over.

1269
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,200
That's why, guys.

1270
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,440
That's why...

1271
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,860
I need them to quickly come out with a new...

1272
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:49,440
massive multiplayer game.

1273
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:50,820
So I can get good...

1274
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:53,760
So I can get really, really good at it.

1275
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,920
And then become the next ninja...

1276
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,940
of that game.

1277
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,380
And then pray to god they have a creator code.

1278
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,620
So I can make...

1279
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:02,340
500,000!

1280
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,120
Guys...

1281
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,540
That's why I'm always begging for another...

1282
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:08,540
Another ma...

1283
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:10,520
Like, multiplayer FPS game.

1284
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:11,220
Or TPS.

1285
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,000
I'll even take TPS, guys.

1286
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,160
I'll even take TPS.

1287
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,580
I'm willing to settle.

1288
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:19,540
So I can be the next...

1289
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:20,260
ninja.

1290
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:21,280
Or tens.

1291
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,520
Or shroud.

1292
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,480
And then make so much fucking content...

1293
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,940
of that one game.

1294
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,700
And I'll be THE VTuber that plays...

1295
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,520
that's really good at this one game.

1296
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,000
I'll be...

1297
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,220
I'll even communicate!

1298
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,520
I'll even do callouts in Marvel!

1299
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:42,520
I swear.

1300
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,440
If Marvel Rivals becomes the next...

1301
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:45,740
I...

1302
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:46,560
I ple...

1303
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,000
Okay.

1304
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,060
Honestly...

1305
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:48,640
I don't...

1306
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,340
Not gonna lie, though...

1307
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,380
I don't think Marvel Rivals...

1308
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:53,140
will...

1309
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:54,320
Um...

1310
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,160
Honestly...

1311
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:55,920
I don't know.

1312
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:56,960
I mean, it has potential.

1313
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,640
But like...

1314
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,400
I've stopped...

1315
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,340
I've stopped...

1316
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:01,380
like, hoping...

1317
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:01,920
I've...

1318
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:06,440
Guys...

1319
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,640
I'm sorry...

1320
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,560
But I've stopped...

1321
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:08,980
believing.

1322
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:12,720
But...

1323
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:14,960
It's...

1324
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:16,320
It seems like a...

1325
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:16,980
quick...

1326
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,020
cash crab.

1327
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:18,900
I...

1328
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,660
Our only hope...

1329
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:22,040
is if, like...

1330
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,160
what's the company...

1331
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,060
What's the game...

1332
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:25,580
game company that makes...

1333
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:26,480
Valorant and...

1334
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,420
League again.

1335
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,680
What are they called again?

1336
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:29,060
Riot.

1337
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,480
My only hope...

1338
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,920
is if Riot makes a Battle Royale...

1339
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,460
or a Team-Based Shooter.

1340
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,940
That's my only hope.

1341
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:36,980
Because they'll do...

1342
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:38,140
everything they can...

1343
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:39,700
to pump millions of dollars...

1344
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:40,640
into the game...

1345
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,660
to make it work.

1346
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:51,180
We all thought CSGO 2 would save us, but CSGO 2 practically killed CSGO.

1347
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:58,820
We all thought the finalist would be the next hype, but then it died so fast.

1348
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:10,320
Please, Riot Games, make a Battle Royale or a multiplayer or a fucking team-based shooter.

1349
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:15,460
Please... Riot is doing major... No!

1350
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:23,620
They're making a fighting game, their next step is a team-based shooter or Battle Royale!

1351
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,080
No!

1352
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,180
I miss the Battle Royale genre.

1353
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:28,800
I miss the Battle Royale genre.

1354
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,080
I miss it so much.

1355
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:33,340
I remember we used to rule the world.

1356
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,400
Now we're just like StarCraft.

1357
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,240
Now we're just like...

1358
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:46,020
Now we're just like strategic games.

1359
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,020
Fighting games are trending now.

1360
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,840
I miss when PUBG was the way it is now.

1361
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,060
There's just too many hackers in PUBG.

1362
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,560
Peter, thank you for the super chat.

1363
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:02,860
Thank you.

1364
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:03,520
Thank you.

1365
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,440
I guess the finalist met its finale.

1366
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:07,700
Thank you for the super chat.

1367
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,080
Thank you.

1368
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:08,640
Thank you.

1369
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,480
It's the fighting game era now.

1370
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,260
I mean, fighting games were always super popular.

1371
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,760
I used to watch... I mean, I watched EVO quite often.

1372
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:17,080
I watched it on and off.

1373
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,960
I used to... I haven't actually...

1374
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:23,580
I haven't watched EVO in like three years?

1375
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:24,440
Two years?

1376
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:26,500
In two years because I never had the time.

1377
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:27,580
But before...

1378
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:28,240
Like, you know...

1379
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,400
Two to three years.

1380
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:32,860
But then like when I had the time, I would watch EVO.

1381
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,180
But usually the finalist.

1382
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,900
Because like that was like the most hype.

1383
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:37,680
The EVO finals.

1384
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:41,440
But...

1385
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:44,420
Like fighting games have always been popular.

1386
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,420
Because they have such a die-hard fan base.

1387
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:49,520
And like the thing about like fighting games is...

1388
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,980
I mean, it's similar with like shooters.

1389
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,920
Where like aim can translate to any type of game.

1390
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,880
And like usually fighting game...

1391
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,440
Fighting game players...

1392
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,920
Like esports players...

1393
00:54:58,920 --> 00:54:59,740
They can like...

1394
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:03,280
They can transfer their skills to like different types of fighting games.

1395
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:05,860
So because like the combos are usually like...

1396
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:06,440
Not like that...

1397
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,580
Not similar in a way.

1398
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:10,140
But you can transfer like how...

1399
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,800
Like different types of...

1400
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,560
Like you can transfer it easily to different types of fighting games.

1401
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:16,200
And that's why like...

1402
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:21,560
I know like esports pros in fighting game genres would be like specialists.

1403
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,920
They won't be like specialists in one game.

1404
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,060
They would like...

1405
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:26,460
They would be...

1406
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:29,580
They would like know how to play multiple fighting games.

1407
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:30,700
And also win...

1408
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:38,340
Win competitions and tournaments in different types of games within fighting games.

1409
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:41,400
So they don't have to be like just like...

1410
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,300
Oh, they're only specialized in this one game.

1411
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:49,400
They can like literally enter so many different games as a player.

1412
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:52,960
And yeah, the...

1413
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,800
It transfers from game to...

1414
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,860
It easily transfers from game to games.

1415
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,360
Yeah, like Justin.1 and SonicFox.

1416
00:55:59,440 --> 00:55:59,840
Yeah, they're...

1417
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,620
Yeah, that's what I was like thinking about too.

1418
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:03,400
Hmm.

1419
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:10,080
So I don't see like fighting games as like...

1420
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,600
I feel like they've always been popular.

1421
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:12,880
I don't think they're like...

1422
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:13,660
Oh, they're like...

1423
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:14,500
It's a new rise.

1424
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:16,020
It's a new trend now.

1425
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,140
I think they've always been pretty popular.

1426
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,080
Because of Evo.

1427
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,240
SleepyAsh, thank you for the super chat.

1428
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:23,580
Thank you.

1429
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,140
Thank you.

1430
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:26,100
I just...

1431
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,340
I just wish...

1432
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:28,480
There was like...

1433
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,200
I was...

1434
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,420
I wish I can adapt.

1435
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,340
I wish I can adapt.

1436
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:44,180
My genre is dying.

1437
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:46,280
What do I do?

1438
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,200
Adapt or die.

1439
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:54,760
But what if I'm too slow to adapt?

1440
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:02,900
I don't know.

1441
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:04,740
Um...

1442
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:06,100
Uh...

1443
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:06,840
Oh my gosh.

1444
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,440
It's been an hour already?

1445
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:09,720
Holy shit.

1446
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:12,180
I can talk for so long.

1447
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:17,040
I really am a yapper.

1448
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,560
The learning curve is too steep.

1449
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,000
I think it's cause like...

1450
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,560
Oh my gosh.

1451
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:26,700
There's so much stuff to do.

1452
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,000
There's just so much stuff to do.

1453
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:31,460
It's hard to make time these days.

1454
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:31,700
So...

1455
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:32,720
I need to like do stuff.

1456
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:36,660
So like that's like one of my biggest issues.

1457
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:40,480
It's just hard to make time to learn new video games and stuff.

1458
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,900
There's a lot to learn.

1459
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:46,240
Like I had like friends that were like you should learn League.

1460
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,800
Bro by the time I get good at League.

1461
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:58,200
League people have been playing League for fucking 10 plus years.

1462
00:57:58,620 --> 00:57:59,940
Like that's just impossible.

1463
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,280
You should not... I also like I don't like MOBAs.

1464
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:14,660
I really... I really don't like MOBAs.

1465
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:17,620
And there's too many characters in League 2.

1466
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:24,100
And then they'd be like, but like, oh you should learn League, you might like it.

1467
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:30,280
I'm like, bro, by the time I even like figure out how to fucking play League, the game would have moved on.

1468
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,960
The game people would be...

1469
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:38,940
Like people who were like at my level when I started would be like 50 times better than me.

1470
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:41,960
Do not learn League, it's not successful.

1471
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:43,780
Thank you for the super chat, Jayah.

1472
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:44,100
Thank you.

1473
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,260
Also like, it's such a money pit.

1474
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,820
Same with Riot, same with Valorant.

1475
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:59,000
People always complain about skins and like currency prices for like other games like Apex and Overwatch.

1476
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,740
But League and Valorant is the biggest money pit ever when it comes to skins.

1477
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:10,260
Because they already set the grounds on like the default of how expensive they are.

1478
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,620
That like people don't complain.

1479
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,060
Because we're all sheep.

1480
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:16,820
Because we're like, oh that was the default anyway, so it's fine.

1481
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,860
Like knife skins being fucking $40.

1482
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,540
Like what the fuck is that bullshit?

1483
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:21,020
Like...

1484
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:26,500
Like...

1485
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,300
I'm just being like...

1486
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,560
Oh my god.

1487
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:37,060
But like an Overwatch skin would be like maybe like $5 to $10.

1488
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:42,500
Like a fucking knife in Valorant.

1489
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,340
It would be so goddamn expensive.

1490
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:49,420
And people will buy multiple skins of that too.

1491
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:51,640
Like multiple cosmetics from that.

1492
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:54,060
And it's actually... I feel like...

1493
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:57,240
I don't want to say that and then I buy Fortnite skins.

1494
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:58,320
But like...

1495
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,680
Fortnite skins are funny.

1496
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:06,540
The thing is I buy Fortnite skins for the crossovers.

1497
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,800
But Valorant is like purely like cosmetics.

1498
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:13,120
Like the design from the store itself.

1499
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:17,980
Like I buy Fortnite skins because I want to be fucking Vegeta in Fortnite.

1500
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:21,120
Like I want to be Peter Griffin in Fortnite.

1501
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:22,000
Like it's funny.

1502
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:24,820
It's just funny.

1503
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:30,080
And it's still cheaper than the fucking Valorant knife.

1504
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,380
It's still cheaper.

1505
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:34,260
But...

1506
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:36,920
Oh my god.

1507
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,220
I just think like...

1508
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:39,340
They're so smart.

1509
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:40,500
They're so smart.

1510
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:43,800
Make the default so fucking expensive that the consumers don't care.

1511
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:49,560
It's so smart!

1512
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:51,480
Oh my god!

1513
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:52,880
It really is!

1514
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:56,920
Because people complain about the cost of skins.

1515
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,760
For every other game.

1516
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:00,900
Except for Valorant and League.

1517
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,440
And then like...

1518
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,500
Well the characters are locked as well.

1519
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,860
In League, right?

1520
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:08,640
So like there's like locked characters in League.

1521
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:13,900
And then if meta changes you might as well like purchase the characters and stuff.

1522
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,040
So...

1523
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,360
They're so smart.

1524
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:17,980
It's just business.

1525
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:19,340
They know how to do business.

1526
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:21,380
Yeah.

1527
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:21,920
Yeah.

1528
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:22,940
You need to unlock them.

1529
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:23,920
They just...

1530
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,560
They just really know how to do business.

1531
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:26,680
Like this.

1532
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:32,100
Thank you for the super chat.

1533
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:32,420
Thank you.

1534
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:32,840
Thank you.

1535
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:35,360
God knows how much money I'm willing to spend for the...

1536
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:35,780
Exactly!

1537
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,280
I'm willing to spend a lot of money for the funny.

1538
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:39,200
Thank you for the super chat.

1539
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:39,580
Thank you.

1540
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,080
Thank you.

1541
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:45,720
League players do complain.

1542
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,780
It's like the only thing we know how to do.

1543
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:49,000
Yeah, you guys complain.

1544
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,360
But you know they're not going to do anything about it.

1545
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:52,280
It's like...

1546
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,360
What are you going to do?

1547
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:54,120
Cry at...

1548
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,340
They're going to use their $100 bills.

1549
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:58,140
And use it as tissue to cry on it.

1550
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,240
It's just like...

1551
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,360
They'll be like...

1552
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:07,980
Leave.

1553
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:10,940
Right?

1554
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:11,840
It's just going to be like...

1555
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:12,140
Fine.

1556
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:12,760
Leave.

1557
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,780
We can replace you.

1558
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:20,600
Yeah.

1559
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:21,380
Yeah.

1560
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:30,200
The people who complain the loudest are the ones who never...

1561
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:30,980
That is so true.

1562
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:31,940
That is so true.

1563
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,540
You will be replaced.

1564
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:41,920
We will do another K-pop collab and we shall replace you.

1565
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:44,440
It's so true!

1566
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:47,820
Like...

1567
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:49,160
People are complaining.

1568
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,260
Drop that K-pop collab now.

1569
01:02:58,380 --> 01:02:59,420
Conspiracy confirmation.

1570
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:00,800
It works.

1571
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:01,900
It just works.

1572
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:03,360
So true.

1573
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:04,060
It works.

1574
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,280
Greg thank you for the super chat.

1575
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,260
Thank you, thank you.

1576
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,760
Neilowser, Thank you for the super chat thank you thank you.

1577
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,700
Leo, Gaming has gone full circle to Barton.

1578
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:16,320
$20 can get you an overwrought skin or full games.

1579
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:17,780
Thank you for the super chat.

1580
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:20,840
Release the KDA sins.

1581
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,720
They will be silenced.

1582
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:24,160
If you say the K O O's, I will be silenced.

1583
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:30,380
It just never fails.

1584
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:33,040
It never fucking fails.

1585
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:34,740
They don't even need to do crossovers.

1586
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:36,340
That's how lucrative they are.

1587
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:39,220
They don't need to do crossovers to actually like...

1588
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:43,380
I mean they do like K-pop and stuff, but those aren't like actual crossover crossovers because they're original music.

1589
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:46,380
They're like, they're like original stuff.

1590
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:51,020
But like other games have to do real fucking crossovers to make people play their game.

1591
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:53,220
That's how powerful Riot is.

1592
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:54,800
Riot marketing is so good.

1593
01:03:55,720 --> 01:04:02,360
Like Overwatch has to do like collabs with different celebrities and different like anime stuff and like shit.

1594
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:02,880
But like...

1595
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,220
But like Riot doesn't have to care.

1596
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:08,280
They just make original content and they don't have to revenue share.

1597
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:11,280
They're like, we don't need a collab with a K-pop.

1598
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,340
We're like, we don't need a collab with K-pop people.

1599
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:16,320
We won't make our own K-pop.

1600
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:18,400
And then they...

1601
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:22,780
I remember there was a Sienna with KDA where they replaced...

1602
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:25,360
I think they replaced like one or the...

1603
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:32,960
One of the members, one or two of the members in the KDA squad of the original KDA squad to somebody else because they didn't want to...

1604
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:42,600
I don't know what the controversy was, but they replaced like one or two of the original singers for the original KDA squad because of something.

1605
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:45,920
Like it was a controversy and then no one cared that they got replaced.

1606
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:47,320
It was like...

1607
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:50,320
They're like, whoa, it's not a little different.

1608
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,620
It was a huge thing.

1609
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:58,480
Yeah.

1610
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:01,820
Yeah, I don't remember why.

1611
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:03,680
I don't remember the controversy.

1612
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:08,020
They just had to be replaced one of the KDA members because of something.

1613
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:11,980
And then because they're like, I don't know what happened, but they replaced one of them.

1614
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:14,820
And then people were like, she sounds a little different.

1615
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,600
Oh, well, I still love KDA.

1616
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:18,340
I still love KDA.

1617
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:20,040
I still love KDA.

1618
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:22,760
I still love KDA.

1619
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:23,440
Thank you for the super chat.

1620
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:23,800
Thank you.

1621
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:24,340
Thank you.

1622
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:27,840
Back in my old league days, we used to cry a lot.

1623
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,360
They just need to release a new skin for us.

1624
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,100
So I'll jump on it.

1625
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:33,720
The cycle continues on to milk us and you shall be milked.

1626
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:35,500
Thank you for the super chat.

1627
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:36,060
Thank you.

1628
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:36,840
Thank you.

1629
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,280
It's a brutal industry.

1630
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:45,360
Yeah, cheap.

1631
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:51,120
And we shall continue to milk you.

1632
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,680
I think I didn't notice that.

1633
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:58,580
Some people didn't notice it.

1634
01:05:58,900 --> 01:05:59,380
Yeah.

1635
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:00,080
All right.

1636
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,320
Honestly, I don't remember.

1637
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:02,900
This is how good Riot PR is.

1638
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:03,960
I don't remember why.

1639
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:06,280
I don't remember why they replaced her.

1640
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:11,120
It's just it was like something going on and people were like, what the fuck?

1641
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:15,180
But just like anyway, here's some more KDA.

1642
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:16,140
Yes.

1643
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:17,400
Yes.

1644
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:17,920
Yes.

1645
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:18,840
Yes.

1646
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:19,220
Yes.

1647
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:19,880
Yes.

1648
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:20,560
Yes.

1649
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:21,080
Yes.

1650
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:21,740
Yes.

1651
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:22,120
Yes.

1652
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:22,640
Yes.

1653
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:22,740
Yes.

1654
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:24,940
Greg, thank you for the super chat.

1655
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:25,280
Thank you.

1656
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:25,820
Thank you.

1657
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:29,560
How much money do I have to pay for you to do a song as a KDA member?

1658
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:31,380
110,000 Canadian?

1659
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,100
One million?

1660
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:33,100
Thank you for the super chat.

1661
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:33,460
Thank you.

1662
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:33,940
Thank you.

1663
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,040
But yeah, they're so smart.

1664
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:39,760
Riot marketing is just...

1665
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:42,160
Riot marketing is just...

1666
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:46,040
Riot marketing and PR, they're just too good.

1667
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:47,920
You know?

1668
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,660
Can't believe they made a game to promote their K-pop.

1669
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:53,720
I heard...

1670
01:06:54,400 --> 01:07:01,920
I heard K-pop VTubers are starting to become extremely popular now.

1671
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:03,220
I know I'm not...

1672
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:04,720
I don't really follow K-pop in general.

1673
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:09,820
I used to like K-pop a lot when I was like a really a lot younger.

1674
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:14,360
Like Girls' Generation and Wonder Girls and Rainism.

1675
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,320
Ba-ba-meanism.

1676
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:17,100
Like I...

1677
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:18,080
Oh, and Super Junior.

1678
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:19,760
Super Junior was...

1679
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:22,620
For those who don't know who Super Junior was, it was the BTS.

1680
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:23,440
Of the time.

1681
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:29,920
Because I used to go to a school that was like 70% Korean students.

1682
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:32,480
So I knew a lot about...

1683
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:36,380
I knew a lot about like K-pop back then before it was like...

1684
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:40,200
I basically knew K-pop before it got big in like NA.

1685
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:41,580
Because I used to...

1686
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,960
I used to go to a school with like 60-70% Korean students.

1687
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:45,920
So...

1688
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:46,360
Oh yeah.

1689
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:46,980
Okay.

1690
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:47,340
Sorry.

1691
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:47,780
Sorry.

1692
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:48,220
Sorry.

1693
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:48,540
Sorry.

1694
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:50,260
Ba-ba-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da.

1695
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:52,620
Tokyo is a...

1696
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:54,380
K-pop boomer.

1697
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,460
Like Super Junior was...

1698
01:07:57,060 --> 01:07:59,300
Was like pre-BTS.

1699
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:02,740
She liked it before it was cool.

1700
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:03,320
I'm a veteran.

1701
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:04,480
But now I don't care.

1702
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:10,340
Now I don't know anything about K-pop.

1703
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:12,000
I don't know anything.

1704
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:22,220
Yeah, I have no idea about like what the fuck is hip now.

1705
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:27,340
Because I don't have like my Korean friends to tell me what's hip.

1706
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:33,140
Oh my god.

1707
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:33,840
In four minutes.

1708
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:34,620
Oh my god.

1709
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:37,160
Didn't like four minutes to spend and people were so...

1710
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:37,760
Wait, 2...

1711
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:38,420
2NE1.

1712
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:39,820
Is 2NE1 still going?

1713
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:43,100
They had like the most creative name ever.

1714
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:46,400
2NE1?

1715
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:48,200
I love their name.

1716
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:49,980
I love like how they...

1717
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,300
It's all the same now.

1718
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:54,380
It's all the same now.

1719
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:55,820
I think they're Spanish, right?

1720
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,720
I really... I used to love the...

1721
01:08:58,720 --> 01:08:59,960
I don't know any other songs.

1722
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:01,240
2NE...

1723
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:02,040
Yeah, 2NE1.

1724
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:03,720
And then everyone call it 2NE1.

1725
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:04,600
Yeah!

1726
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:05,760
Oh, they separate now?

1727
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:07,280
They're still popular solos?

1728
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:09,720
But I don't... I don't remember any of the songs they made.

1729
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:10,340
I just remember...

1730
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:11,800
I just love their way...

1731
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:12,820
Yeah, is that how you...

1732
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:13,580
Is it 2NE1?

1733
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:14,040
Yeah.

1734
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:16,220
2NE1.

1735
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:18,620
That's supposed to be like how it's pronounced.

1736
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,580
Yeah, that was a K-pop boomer.

1737
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:25,160
I don't follow K-pop anymore though.

1738
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,300
But yeah, there's like apparently like...

1739
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:31,840
K-pop VTubers are becoming like super popular.

1740
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:33,940
I was reading about how like...

1741
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:37,680
There's a new VTuber boom in Korea now.

1742
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:42,820
And that's why like a lot of people are doing like VTuber groups based off of K-pop.

1743
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:44,180
Because like...

1744
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:49,560
There is a huge VTuber boom now in Korea.

1745
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:52,320
So that's why like people are starting like K-pop.

1746
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:52,900
Stuff.

1747
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:53,280
Yeah.

1748
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:53,800
Yeah, Plav.

1749
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:54,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1750
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:54,780
Plav?

1751
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:55,680
Is that how you pronounce it?

1752
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:59,520
It's going like crazy now over there.

1753
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:03,360
So that's why you might be seeing like why a lot of like...

1754
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:07,420
A lot of like people are focusing on K-pop now for VTubers.

1755
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:12,760
Or like a lot of people are doing like K-pop stuff or like focusing on marketing in Korea.

1756
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:15,220
Just because like...

1757
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:16,480
I think like...

1758
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,320
Was it Plav or Plav?

1759
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:18,820
I can't...

1760
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:19,380
I've never...

1761
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:21,840
I've only heard like one or two songs because I was curious about it.

1762
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,060
Yeah, it's like...

1763
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:26,320
You know how like the VTuber boom in NA because of COVID?

1764
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:28,460
So it's like there's like a...

1765
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:33,220
And like there's a VTuber boom in NA like that was started because like COVID and stuff.

1766
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:40,440
And there was like a VTuber boom in like certain countries and stuff like that because like certain events.

1767
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:43,080
So now the VTuber boom is start...

1768
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:48,060
Is picking up now and starting in Korea at the moment because of...

1769
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:50,640
Because of the VTuber K-pop groups.

1770
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:53,280
And...

1771
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,100
And...

1772
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:55,400
Am I pronouncing the name right?

1773
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:55,820
Plav?

1774
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:56,780
Or is it Plav?

1775
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:00,540
I can't believe Doki is going to be a K-pop...

1776
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:04,340
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA And also...

1777
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:07,480
It also helps a lot with the fact that like...

1778
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:08,460
Twitch...

1779
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:09,620
They can't stream on Twitch anymore.

1780
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:10,660
So they have to stream on YouTube.

1781
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:15,080
So like making music is like one of the easiest way.

1782
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:16,260
Uh...

1783
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:18,260
It's PlayV?

1784
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:19,200
Is that right?

1785
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:19,720
PlayV?

1786
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:20,320
PlayV?

1787
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:23,340
PlayV.

1788
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:24,620
Is that how you pronounce it?

1789
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:31,580
So...

1790
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:36,220
Yeah, they're K-pop VTubers now because it's the new thing.

1791
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:37,080
It's...

1792
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:40,500
Well, not new thing but it's the VTuber boom now.

1793
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:46,200
It also like doesn't help that BTS is still in the army.

1794
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:48,620
It's still in the army.

1795
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:49,740
They're still in the army.

1796
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,620
So like people are looking at like new...

1797
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:54,380
I guess like new...

1798
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:56,460
Substitutes for it.

1799
01:11:56,900 --> 01:12:00,540
And that's why like people have migrated to like VTubers.

1800
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:01,660
Um...

1801
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:04,180
Yeah, cause they're like the BTS VTuber now.

1802
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:04,880
Yeah.

1803
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:08,820
And it's...

1804
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:09,520
Um...

1805
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:12,200
So they're like the VTuber...

1806
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:13,680
I guess you could call them like...

1807
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:15,300
BTS VTubers.

1808
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:17,480
Uh...

1809
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:20,540
Uh...

1810
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:21,640
BTS is in the army.

1811
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:22,480
Yes that's why they...

1812
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:22,720
They're...

1813
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:23,500
Yes.

1814
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:29,460
Wait... guys, were you under the rock?

1815
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:31,360
They've been in the army for a while now.

1816
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:32,200
That's why...

1817
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:35,980
That's why a lot of K-pop fans have migrated to VTubers.

1818
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,160
Because they were trying to find a substitute to BTS.

1819
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,620
I was like... they're like... BTS is in the armies?

1820
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:48,680
Were you guys living under a fucking rock?

1821
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:49,600
Yes, that's why.

1822
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:54,600
I think it's like two years.

1823
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:55,640
I'm pretty sure.

1824
01:12:56,230 --> 01:12:58,340
I think it's like around two years.

1825
01:12:59,270 --> 01:13:01,100
And then they're back.

1826
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:03,620
This has been a minute.

1827
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:11,760
It's like two to three years.

1828
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:13,660
Yeah, two to three years.

1829
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:18,720
So I thought that was like super... super interesting.

1830
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:21,240
But yeah, if you guys don't know...

1831
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:22,920
Twitch like...

1832
01:13:23,740 --> 01:13:25,220
I think it was like...

1833
01:13:25,220 --> 01:13:27,840
I don't remember the whole thing.

1834
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:28,720
Oh yeah!

1835
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:31,400
I think it was like Korea wanted to...

1836
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:32,340
It was weird.

1837
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:32,780
It's weird.

1838
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:33,580
It's so complicated.

1839
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:37,060
Because like Twitch didn't want to pay the extra fees or something.

1840
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:38,360
So then...

1841
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:39,880
So they're like... now we out.

1842
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:43,520
Because they're like... we're losing money anyway.

1843
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:44,260
So we're out.

1844
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,320
To be fair, Twitch is always losing money.

1845
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:48,560
If you guys didn't know, Twitch has not made back their money yet.

1846
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:49,800
They're still in the negatives.

1847
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:51,420
So because like...

1848
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:53,300
Bandwidth and like servers...

1849
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:56,200
Server hosting is like crazy fucking expensive.

1850
01:13:57,420 --> 01:14:00,640
And Twitch is already like losing money.

1851
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:01,760
And then...

1852
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,200
And then like they...

1853
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:07,800
I think like the ISP wanted to charge more to Twitch.

1854
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,900
But then they were like bro, we're already fucking losing money.

1855
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:10,360
Like no.

1856
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:11,300
And then they're like...

1857
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:11,580
And then...

1858
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:13,480
And then I guess like...

1859
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:16,340
I guess like the ISP was like you won't leave.

1860
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:17,380
There's no way.

1861
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:18,080
You need us.

1862
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:18,860
And then Twitch was...

1863
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:20,500
Twitch like was like bet.

1864
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:21,700
And then they left.

1865
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:22,800
And then like...

1866
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:23,860
There was this whole thing.

1867
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:27,860
There was this whole thing where like...

1868
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:29,780
I think like the ISP tried to...

1869
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:32,740
Try to pursue a lawsuit against Twitch.

1870
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:33,780
Yeah, what would you do?

1871
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:34,040
Leave?

1872
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:35,140
And then Twitch was like okay.

1873
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:41,820
And then...

1874
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:45,100
I think like they tried to pursue a lawsuit against Twitch.

1875
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:46,660
But something was like wait, you can't leave.

1876
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:47,680
Here's another...

1877
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:49,120
We're gonna fine you if you leave.

1878
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:50,720
And then Twitch was like...

1879
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:51,420
Bye.

1880
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:58,380
Bye.

1881
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:00,820
But this part was really little short.

1882
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:01,340
It's getting into this.

1883
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:01,360
But that's it.

1884
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:02,660
So this like it made a lot of...

1885
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:03,640
It really sucked.

1886
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:11,280
Because it meant like a lot of Twitch streamers, even like chatters too, they can't sub to their favorite streamers.

1887
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:14,460
Like a lot of like Korean stream...

1888
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:20,860
Like chatters or like Korean accounts on Twitch, they can't even like sub or do anything...

1889
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:21,500
Now, get it?

1890
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:29,280
I think they can chat, but they can't donate anything, they can't buy anything on Twitch to support their streamers.

1891
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:34,520
So it really sucks for the chatters and also the content creators too.

1892
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:39,280
I know a lot of them moved to Afreeca, is that it?

1893
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,680
Afreeca, YouTube, Cake.

1894
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:52,980
I think it's pretty interesting that it basically rejuvenized Afreeca.

1895
01:15:53,340 --> 01:16:02,040
Because Afreeca TV, for those who don't know what Afreeca TV is, it's the Korean equivalent to Twitch.

1896
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:08,540
And when Twitch started getting more popular, nobody really used Afreeca anymore.

1897
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,660
But because of the Twitch ban, everyone went back to Afreeca.

1898
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:20,440
I remember because Overwatch used to be super popular in Korea.

1899
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:22,420
And a lot of Korean streamers will use Afreeca.

1900
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:26,940
It was completely dead and now it's back now.

1901
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:30,380
Because of Twitch being kicked out of Korea.

1902
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:37,280
So I thought it was really interesting.

1903
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:41,040
It always goes back to Overwatch.

1904
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:47,180
Oh, yeah.

1905
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,520
I thought it was really interesting.

1906
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:52,700
The universe is quite an interesting place sometimes.

1907
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:57,480
Anyway guys.

1908
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:00,220
I'm going to call it here.

1909
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:03,760
Because we had a super long Overwatch stream today.

1910
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:06,120
So I'm sorry I couldn't chat longer.

1911
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:07,760
Oh my god, Bite Size!

1912
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:09,700
Thank you for the 50 gifted chips!

1913
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:11,120
Thank you, thank you!

1914
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,040
I really appreciate it!

1915
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:14,160
Thank you so much!

1916
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:15,100
Holy shit!

1917
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:17,300
Anyway guys.

1918
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:20,000
I am going to call it here.

1919
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:21,240
Yeah, it's over already.

1920
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:24,320
We talked for like almost an hour and a half, everyone!

1921
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,700
So I'm going to rest now.

1922
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,320
I always have a great time just chatting with my dragoons.

1923
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:36,240
But I hope we hit 700k soon.

1924
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:37,300
Our first milestone.

1925
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:38,320
Official milestone.

1926
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,160
I remember I was like, I hope I get 500k by the end of the year.

1927
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:47,880
I'm going to treat 700k as our first official milestone to hit.

1928
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:49,700
But thank you everybody!

1929
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:53,180
I always have a great time just hanging out and chatting with everyone.

1930
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:54,920
Never think of the super chat.

1931
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:55,440
Thank you, thank you.

1932
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:56,320
Have a nice rest week.

1933
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:57,000
It's not... I'm sorry.

1934
01:17:57,060 --> 01:17:58,080
It's not going to be a rest week unfortunately.

1935
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:01,620
There's a lot of things going on behind the scenes.

1936
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:04,280
So it's not going to be a rest week.

1937
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,280
But thank you so much for the super chat, Neppers.

1938
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,220
Thank you, thank you.

1939
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:11,000
As always everybody, stay hydrated.

1940
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:12,300
Posture check.

1941
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,300
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

1942
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:16,440
And if you stayed up for me, head to bed.

1943
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,080
Because you deserve it!

1944
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:19,580
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

1945
01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:20,920
Bye guys!

1946
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:21,940
Bye!
