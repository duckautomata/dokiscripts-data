00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:49,830
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,410
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:58,630
Oh my god, I am... I am so excited right now to be here.

4
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:03,830
I literally just got back from my fan-made panel like 10 minutes ago, so now I'm here.

5
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,170
Oh my god, I'm so excited.

6
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:15,950
Ah, huge shout out to Marble Rivals for this opportunity to check out the early access of Ultron and season 2.5.

7
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,430
So, oh my gosh, I'm so nervous, everyone.

8
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,730
But thank you, everybody, for all the gifted subs!

9
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,730
Oh my god, thank you for the raid, Gomez!

10
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,210
Thank you, thank you, everyone!

11
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:31,230
Yes, I will be checking out everything very, very, very soon.

12
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:35,830
There is a lot of stuff to look into, so I'm very, very excited.

13
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,530
Marco, thank you for the 10 gifted subs!

14
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,550
Thank you, thank you!

15
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,270
Thank you, everybody!

16
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:48,650
Like you guys said, I still don't have my third monitor yet, so I might be very slow in reading stuff right now because I only have two monitors instead of three.

17
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,450
Wow, Doki, only two monitors?

18
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:52,170
Wow!

19
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,810
Look, I've been streaming so long for three monitors!

20
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:57,730
It's weird!

21
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,710
I can't, I have everything cramped into my second monitor right now!

22
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,350
Like all the things I have to say and everything!

23
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:08,330
Anyway, for those who don't know, I pinned a link to my rivals.

24
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,610
If you guys have not checked out the game yet, please feel free to click on the link.

25
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,550
It does help out a lot.

26
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,950
And download the game and you think it looks fun!

27
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,410
Anyway, uh, blah, blah, blah, blah.

28
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:26,830
Uh, so there is, Marvel's season 2.5 is coming out, um, on May 30th, very, very, very soon.

29
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:35,730
Uh, but we do have, very thankful to Marvel Rivals for sponsoring this stream, so that, and giving me the opportunity to check it out early for you guys, so you know what to look out for!

30
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,230
Uh, so a lot of things are coming out.

31
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,590
It is free to play, and all the heroes are unlocked right away.

32
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:47,230
And the newest hero for this season, sorry, for next season is Ultron!

33
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,270
Yes, the newest support character!

34
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:57,290
Um, I finally binded my descent key just so I could play Ultron, because you guys know I am a support player for Marvel Rivals.

35
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:05,250
And, um, I had unbinded my descent key, so every time I had to go down, I looked down.

36
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,830
I had to, I had to look down to move, go down.

37
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:16,050
But now, now I finally binded, I can't do that anymore!

38
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:29,250
I, so my descent key is finally binded, because there finally is a, a, there's finally a support character that flies, so I cannot do that anymore.

39
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,130
But yes, there is a lot, always new updates coming in.

40
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:37,050
Um, you guys didn't know, they always add a new hero every, uh, every, uh, season change.

41
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:41,770
So, like, season two, season two or five, season one, season 1.5, they always add a new hero.

42
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,690
So we get, like, two new heroes per season.

43
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:48,870
Um, and so there's so many new updates and everything, and all the new, there's gonna be so many things to check out!

44
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,850
But, before we check that out, we're gonna watch some trailers!

45
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,670
Please let me know if the volume is okay!

46
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:56,730
Hey, hey, hey!

47
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:05,070
Um, but, oh yeah, if you guys are like, Ultron doesn't seem very supportive, you're sort of right, because I will show you guys why.

48
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:14,430
You're not very wrong, but we'll show you guys the trailers for the new map, and Ultron itself.

49
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,390
So yes, let me, uh, let me put that up here.

50
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:18,530
Boom!

51
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,010
This is, I don't remember what this, oh, there's Ultron!

52
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:30,550
So Ultron is, uh, one of the support, the new flyer support.

53
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:39,350
So his left click, by the way, I'll tell you guys right now, there's no, there's, there's barely falloff for his left click.

54
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,130
I was on the other side of the training arena.

55
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:49,510
I was, I was on the other side, and I was going, pew!

56
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,930
You know, like, I was like, pew!

57
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,890
I'll let you guys know that right now.

58
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,890
It's going to be very fun to see.

59
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,890
I was like, oh, that's silly.

60
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:13,310
But I know, if I was on the other side of that, I'll be like, wait, that's not silly no more.

61
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,710
Actually, I have not checked out the new map, so that's going to be new for me.

62
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,990
Like, actually 100% new.

63
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:30,070
So, so the sister, I love Krakoa.

64
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,230
Can't wait to check this one out.

65
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,590
I actually have not looked at the map.

66
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:42,930
I think it's silly when I play Ultron, but I know it's not going to be silly when I'm not, when that enemy Ultron does that to me.

67
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,270
Is it payload?

68
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,130
I don't know.

69
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,470
Good question.

70
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:51,810
I actually don't know.

71
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,750
That was the one I didn't check out.

72
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,630
I was looking through everything.

73
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,310
So I was like, okay, well, should I look, look out for it?

74
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,590
When I like, uh, look at everything.

75
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,310
And just to see, make sure I got everything down.

76
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,350
Um, to show you guys.

77
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,410
And like, I actually did not look at the new map.

78
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,510
So I'm just as curious as you guys.

79
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,390
It looks really cool though.

80
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:17,570
It's only funny when it happens to someone else.

81
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,590
Yeah, that's basically it.

82
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,950
I was like, not funny no more.

83
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,190
This is not funny.

84
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,510
Um, I heard there's also like a lot of new cosmetics and everything.

85
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:29,050
All right.

86
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:29,350
All right.

87
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:29,770
Enough.

88
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,030
Enough talking without the game.

89
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,290
It's time to show you guys the game now.

90
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,130
All right.

91
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,830
Oh, I'm so excited.

92
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,930
This should be it.

93
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,570
Oh, I'm so excited.

94
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,430
Okay, let me log in real quick, guys.

95
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,010
I forgot to log in.

96
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,630
I knew I forgot something.

97

Anonymous Gifter.

98
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,070
Thank you for the gift itself.

99
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,450
I really appreciate it.

100
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,970
Oh yeah, let me change the volume.

101
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,230
I realized the game has no volume.

102
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,270
Oopsie.

103
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,270
All right, there you go.

104
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:02,830
All right.

105
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,450
So yes, the new costume.

106
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,750
So there's the new Hawkeye free costume for Hawkeye.

107
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,510
Because Hawkeye is a little broken.

108
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,830
And so these are all the, you guys gotta complete these challenges to get the new Hawkeye costume.

109
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,490
And then there's this one too.

110
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:17,930
The combat chest.

111
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:18,950
Anonymous Gifter.

112
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,670
Thank you for the 20 gifted subs.

113
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,170
Thank you.

114
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:21,850
Thank you.

115
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,650
So there's all the, there's Magneto.

116
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,850
Um, there's Storm.

117
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,850
Um, and then there's, uh, uh, Mr. Fantastic.

118
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,910
Oh, wait, what's the... No, I want to see.

119
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,030
I want to see open.

120
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,750
What's the make it real?

121
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,350
Okay, I like that one.

122
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,890
Normally, I don't use emotes, but that's a good emote right there.

123
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:54,390
I feel like people are gonna abuse this emote during the lobby.

124
00:08:54,790 --> 00:09:01,290
And you, when you get Iron Man in there, get Iron Man and Emma Frost, and then we're gonna have a party.

125
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:07,350
Oh, wait, that's so cool.

126
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,510
And Venom!

127
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:10,590
And Venom!

128
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,290
Oh my god, you're right.

129
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,430
Iron Man, Venom, and Emma Frost.

130
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,910
The perfect emote combo.

131
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,350
The roleplay meta is evolving, guys.

132
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:23,550
Oh my god, I cannot wait for the roleplay meta in my doom lobbies.

133
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,830
When I'm in the doom queues.

134
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:31,150
When I'm waiting in, on, in the doom lobbies, waiting for my match.

135
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,150
I cannot wait.

136
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,110
Oh, cool.

137
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,250
Okay, so there's the other new emote.

138
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,770
There's the, uh, oh, that's the emote for Mr. Fantastic.

139
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,510
So it's basically future foundation.

140
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,450
What I thought was cool, okay, I think, let's see if this works.

141
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:54,730
But it gives you a preview of the other skins too, which I thought.

142
00:09:54,890 --> 00:10:02,550
So you get to see the future foundation of, um, I, I don't know if that's spy, is that Spider-Man over there?

143
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,470
Over there at the, yeah, I think this is, this is the battle.

144
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,830
Uh, yeah, this has to be the, yeah, is that Spider-Man?

145
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,170
Where's the human torch?

146
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:18,250
Did they, like, they replaced, sorry, Johnny.

147
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:24,370
We have, he was like, sorry, Johnny, my new brother, Spider-Man.

148
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,510
He replaced Johnny.

149
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:34,430
Um, uh, okay, and then there's Magneto.

150
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:38,770
Uh, we have Magneto right here.

151
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,150
Wait, what?

152
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,450
No, I, it's just fake.

153
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,830
We all know it's not real.

154
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,010
We all know he's not actually dead.

155
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:56,050
In superhero, in superhero lore, no one's actually dead dead, guys.

156
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:04,510
Also, I noticed, um, what I noticed that was really interesting was, uh, we have to show you guys.

157
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:05,810
Where is it?

158
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,670
It was like a, um, where was it?

159
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,150
I saw, oh yeah, there was something really interesting.

160
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,550
By the way, this is my new name now.

161
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,030
Oh, here, you can put this next to your name plates.

162
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,050
Um, it's not muted.

163
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,850
It's just really, there's not really any sound right now.

164
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,850
I'm my number one fan, guys.

165
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:24,610
It's not muted.

166
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:28,070
I, I had, um, there's not really much volume right now.

167
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,770
So, you can, there's like barely any volume in this game at the moment.

168
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,850
So, it's not really muted, because it's the main.

169
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,350
But I thought this was really cute.

170
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:41,650
Um, I also turn a lot of the sound stuff, like, low, too.

171
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,190
Uh, like, see the master volume?

172
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,410
I have a lot of it very low.

173
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:50,170
So, uh, let me turn it back up, though.

174
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,530
Well, well, well, to how I usually do it.

175
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,010
I'll turn it up a little bit.

176
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,810
Uh, buh, buh, buh.

177
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,450
Oh, I like music.

178
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,510
I'll turn the music up.

179
00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:59,030
Back up.

180
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,030
All right.

181
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,150
There we go.

182
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,270
That should be good.

183
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,270
Uh, all right.

184
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,030
I'll let you guys listen to this stuff again.

185
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:10,110
Oh, there's... Let it rain.

186
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,650
Oh, yeah, you guys want to see the, this part.

187
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:15,090
Yay!

188
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:19,570
There we go.

189
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,730
Is that volume better now?

190
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,290
All right, so there's that.

191
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,330
And I believe... Okay, so...

192
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,270
I did buy the Ultron, new Ultron skin.

193
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,670
Because, like, I was curious on what it looked like, because it looked pretty cool.

194
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,950
I don't know which one I like.

195
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:34,970
I don't know.

196
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,650
I don't know if I like this one.

197
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:40,830
Or... I don't know if I like the original or the Extron.

198
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,050
They both look good in its own way.

199
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:47,370
And then there's this, the alternative, the mechanical, uh, phantom.

200
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,210
This, this one looks very clean.

201
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,330
Uh, can you show his lord icon?

202
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:51,650
Yeah.

203
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,090
That's his... I believe... Wait.

204
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:55,690
There you go.

205
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:56,830
That's his lord icon.

206
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:57,650
Wow!

207
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,850
I don't know.

208
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,670
Like, the original one just looks really clean.

209
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,330
And so, like, it's so hard to see which one I like.

210
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,050
Also, a little, thank you for the five gifted subs.

211
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,110
Thank you, thank you.

212
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:13,210
And then we have, like, you know, the gamer energy drink Ultron.

213
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,920
It's K, I don't know.

214
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,780
Or the quad.

215
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,240
Like, P. It's like, do I want to be a gamer today?

216
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,240
Or, or, or, or what?

217
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,600
Um, all right.

218
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,400
So, I'll show you guys what, um, what I mean.

219
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:38,980
Okay, wait.

220
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,460
Let me see.

221
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,300
I need to make sure I follow, uh, let's see.

222
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,840
I'm gonna go through everything to make sure I got everything, got everything I need to check out.

223
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,480
Oh, yeah.

224
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:51,880
Here you go.

225
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,220
That's the normal battle pass.

226
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,300
This is, like, extra.

227
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,440
The combat chest.

228
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,480
Instantly get one reward.

229
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,640
Let's go.

230
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,760
Yay!

231
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,640
Now I can equip... Hi!

232
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,520
What do I use this for?

233
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,320
Wait, I should buy this.

234
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,220
I'll buy this.

235
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,960
I just want this.

236
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:12,700
Not gonna...

237
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,260
That's all I want for now.

238
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,020
That's all I want.

239
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,540
Of course.

240
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,300
Oh, it's the new emotes.

241
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:25,940
Oh, my gosh.

242
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:26,660
It's...

243
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,820
Sometimes it feels like you guys know more than me, but I didn't read the patch notes.

244
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,940
I was trying... gonna enjoy.

245
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,640
I was gonna, like, figure it out as I go along.

246
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,040
But thank you for letting me out.

247
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,720
Yeah, Emma's making it rain.

248
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,260
Marco, thank you for the 10 gifted subs.

249
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:42,740
Thank you.

250
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,500
Thank you.

251
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,520
Sometimes I just don't read the patch notes, guys.

252
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,320
I just...

253
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,200
Readings for nerds.

254
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:51,840
Exactly!

255
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,420
Oh, exactly!

256
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,820
That's what I'm saying!

257
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,640
Why read when I can be told what to do?

258
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,820
That's why I became a streamer!

259
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,500
That's the whole point of streaming!

260
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,120
Being yelled at and told what to do!

261
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,620
Alright, okay, so I'm gonna show you guys...

262
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,180
I'll show you guys what I mean, but...

263
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,500
Okay, guys.

264
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,540
Alright, I'll show you guys.

265
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,800
This is my favorite part.

266
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,200
Alright, so...

267
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,300
See that?

268
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,360
Now watch me move further away.

269
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,320
Watch me slowly move further away!

270
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,420
And then...

271
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,820
Watch me continue to move further away!

272
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,140
What is the range, you might ask?

273
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,020
Yes!

274
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,840
I think that's funny.

275
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,060
That's... that's the silly thing.

276
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,540
It's so silly.

277
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,140
It's so silly.

278
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,080
The range...

279
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,660
The range is...

280
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,200
Yes!

281
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,610
Okay, so...

282
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,220
You wanna know what's even sillier?

283
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,020
Let me show you.

284
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,820
It's also...

285
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:11,140
Let me show you what's even sillier, guys.

286
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,200
Alright, so...

287
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,620
Okay, it's his team up.

288
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,100
So when you get Iron Man...

289
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:17,980
Um...

290
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,360
When you...

291
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,140
Let me show you guys.

292
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,240
So...

293
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,220
Alright...

294
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,740
So there's Iron Man, right?

295
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,860
So he has...

296
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,500
He has a special team up, guys.

297
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,960
So if you guys...

298
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,680
Don't go.

299
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,980
Alright, you see that guy?

300
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,980
So this is his team up.

301
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,540
And I can...

302
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,880
Heal and damage at the same time.

303
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,380
Right?

304
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,880
Alright, so imagine this.

305
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,520
You died.

306
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,800
It's overtime.

307
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,600
You have the Iron Man power-up.

308
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:48,880
Wha...

309
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,860
Alright, watch my...

310
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,040
This guy dies first.

311
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,700
You died.

312
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,100
You died.

313
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,000
Save the game.

314
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,800
Yeah, you're slowly getting over to your team.

315
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,300
You're slowly trying to get to your team.

316
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,340
You're all the way from spawn, but it's okay.

317
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,500
You have an Iron Man.

318
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,800
And then you kill him.

319
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,740
You can shoot through your teammate to kill him too.

320
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,200
So you see a person is in front of you.

321
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,000
It's cooking.

322
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,520
And then you can shoot through your own teammate to heal him.

323
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,100
To kill somebody.

324
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,400
His left click doesn't heal.

325
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,760
The only way to heal is this.

326
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,140
So this is the E.

327
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,340
This is the only way to heal.

328
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,240
This is literally your only heal button.

329
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
Also your right click too.

330
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,840
Your right click heals as well.

331
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,720
But oh yeah, so... So his ult... You know what's funny?

332
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,700
What I realized about his ult?

333
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:00,960
It's like...

334
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,080
Where's the real Ultron?

335
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,080
It's gonna be so hard to shoot... Also this heals too.

336
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,640
It's gonna be very hard to shoot the real Ultron.

337
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,180
But this is... I'm not pressing any buttons by the way.

338
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,180
This is automatic.

339
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,080
This is all automatic.

340
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,040
So I'm not pressing any buttons.

341
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,280
It just keeps going.

342
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,980
But that's his ult.

343
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,900
I also have no cooldowns on right now.

344
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,700
Yeah, it's auto.

345
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,100
It's auto.

346
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,400
So yeah, that's the fun part.

347
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,800
So the shield is basically... I put this on.

348
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,880
And no matter where I go... Okay, wait.

349
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:35,700
Let me make...

350
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,040
Okay, so... Let me see this.

351
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,300
I put that on.

352
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,420
And I put it on him.

353
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,440
And then wherever I am going...

354
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,420
He gets healed.

355
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,120
But the thing is that... There's a range.

356
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,060
I found out.

357
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:46,720
So...

358
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,660
You can't put it on a flanker.

359
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,260
You have to put it on a person.

360
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,240
Because if you don't, it... It just goes like out of range.

361
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,900
Because there's a range to it.

362
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:57,480
See?

363
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,120
So that's good.

364
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,880
So you don't have to... So you...

365
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,840
Flinkers aren't people.

366
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,620
They're not real.

367
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,100
I will not acknowledge Psylocke.

368
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,580
Yes, this is an AoE heal.

369
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,120
So whoever's... If this guy is in his drone thing...

370
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,380
He gets healed.

371
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,780
But this guy gets more of the healing.

372
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,860
And everything.

373
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:21,880
So...

374
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,620
How could she say that?

375
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,760
Alright, so...

376
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,180
That's all...

377
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,900
I want to show you guys on Ultron.

378
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,840
Because those are...

379
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,940
That's like the most interesting part.

380
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,900
Um... But like...

381
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,040
Okay, I keep going back to the spawn for this...

382
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,340
Okay, but like people are saying that Jeff...

383
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,780
He made Jeff shitty now.

384
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:41,560
No.

385
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:43,840
Because...

386
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,420
Let me show you this.

387
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,280
Team up.

388
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,960
Watch this.

389
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,820
Watch this guys.

390
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,880
This is a very interesting team up.

391
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,400
He's dead.

392
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:26,900
He...

393
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,920
He's dead.

394
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,060
And watch how much damage it did to this guy.

395
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,620
He's almost dead.

396
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,180
Ha ha ha!

397
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:34,660
Ha ha ha.

398
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,000
That.

399
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,940
Ha hou ha ha!

400
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,540
So, whenever...

401
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,340
Whoever I ate...

402
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,360
Gets hurt in the stormal.恐se So he's dead.

403
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,500
Whoever... Ha hi ha ha.

404
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,040
So this is a second guy.

405
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,260
And he's...

406
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,240
This is the second guy that I got eaten.

407
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,360
Cause he respawned.

408
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,180
Happy to help.

409
00:20:55,180 --> 00:21:00,560
So when I eat somebody, whoever I eat... dies in the Storm ult.

410
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,560
The Storm ult damages, damages whoever is inside my belly.

411
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,240
And then Storm gets 12 seconds of ult.

412
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,740
Because she gets an extra 6 seconds of her ult.

413
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,120
Oh yeah, this is one of my favorite too.

414
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,120
Look how fast... okay, I'll show you guys.

415
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,980
Look how fast I heal this guy.

416
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:25,670
They're full healed.

417
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,430
Look how fast that was.

418
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,570
One, two, three, four.

419
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,310
And they get over here.

420
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,830
Oh, but this is my favorite too.

421
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:47,870
Wait, let me show you.

422
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,210
Okay, watch this.

423
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:52,930
Shoot me.

424
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:54,610
Shoot me.

425
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,330
Alright.

426
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:59,610
Yo, I'll show you guys the visualization of this.

427
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,830
Because it's pretty neat.

428
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,110
It's... it's pretty neat.

429
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,230
Alright, he has to go yummy yummy.

430
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,810
Yummy yummy.

431
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:11,790
Come on.

432
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:12,890
Yummy yummy me.

433
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,410
Yummy yummy.

434
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,210
The bubbles don't stack by the way.

435
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,290
Watch.

436
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:20,850
Shielding never hurts.

437
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:21,270
Yay!

438
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,830
Did you guys see how fast that was?

439
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:26,750
Whoa!

440
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:27,730
Whoa!

441
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,390
Okay.

442
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:31,690
Yeah!

443
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,210
Isn't that crazy?

444
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,790
I was like, whoa!

445
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,720
That's pretty funny.

446
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:37,730
That's pretty funny.

447
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:38,610
And then I think...

448
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:39,090
And then like...

449
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,210
And then like...

450
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:43,170
I'm pretty sure everyone else was like, that's not funny.

451
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,310
And then...

452
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,710
He would be like...

453
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:49,650
Doki no.

454
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,370
That's not funny.

455
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,650
But I was like...

456
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:53,150
Oh wait.

457
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,150
That's pretty funny.

458
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:54,850
Yeah!

459
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,210
Alright.

460
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,590
Let me show you this.

461
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,930
This one was funny.

462
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,610
Wait, wait.

463
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,990
I'll show you something even funnier.

464
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,570
Give me a sec.

465
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,050
Alright.

466
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,530
Oh wait.

467
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,490
Guys, I'll show you something even funnier, guys.

468
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,770
Let me head over there real fast.

469
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,250
Watch this, guys.

470
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,470
It's pretty funny.

471
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,390
Let me...

472
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:23,990
I'll be here.

473
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:24,610
Watch this.

474
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,060
Oh my god.

475
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,180
I don't play lock, guys.

476
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:33,980
So I'm...

477
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,420
There you go.

478
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,460
Oh my god.

479
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:36,800
Please.

480
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,480
I can't.

481
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:38,640
That's okay.

482
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,680
I can shoot through the walls.

483
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,660
There's no way.

484
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,220
It's pretty funny.

485
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,480
It goes through everything, by the way.

486
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,160
Let me show you guys what I mean.

487
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,020
Very...

488
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,080
Ha ha.

489
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,440
Fun.

490
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,440
Yeah.

491
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,660
And the further you are, the more damage you do.

492
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,740
So you see that guy?

493
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,240
Wait.

494
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:14,820
Where is he?

495
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,640
Where even is he?

496
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,380
Oh my god.

497
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,360
I don't know where he is.

498
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,180
I think I need to, like, figure him out.

499
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:20,680
Okay, guys.

500
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,160
I need to figure out where he is, guys.

501
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,440
Where is he?

502
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,920
Where is he on that...

503
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:25,920
area?

504
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:26,580
Oh wait.

505
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,380
There's a range, right?

506
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:29,720
Where is he?

507
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:30,980
Ha ha ha.

508
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,200
Where is he?

509
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,780
I don't know where he is!

510
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:34,540
Ha ha ha.

511
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,520
Don't go.

512
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,200
Don't go.

513
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,080
Where is he?

514
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,740
Wait, did I hit him?

515
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,680
Heads up, bad guys!

516
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,100
I don't even know!

517
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,320
Where did he go?

518
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:46,800
Oh, there...

519
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,400
Oh, he's over...

520
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,380
Guys, it's just I missed.

521
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,560
I don't know where he is.

522
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,560
Because there's a wall.

523
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,600
I don't know if you guys noticed this, but there's a wall.

524
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,180
There we go.

525
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,000
Okay, now I know where he is.

526
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:55,920
I...

527
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,580
Ha ha ha.

528
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,700
Wait, do I actually?

529
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,720
Oh, there he is.

530
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,380
Alright.

531
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,960
I need to have walls.

532
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,280
I don't know where he is.

533
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,000
Ha ha ha.

534
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,900
It doesn't feel like...

535
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,740
Sometimes I don't know where he is.

536
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:13,000
But the further you are, the more damage you do, apparently.

537
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:13,400
Look.

538
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,540
Okay, I figured it out.

539
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,120
There he is.

540
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,080
There we go.

541
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:17,800
There we go.

542
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,000
We figured out where he is.

543
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,260
Ha ha ha.

544
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,480
I don't see a wall up there.

545
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:25,920
Alright, there...

546
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,160
Oh, oh, it's right here!

547
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,180
Guys, did you see that?

548
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,220
It's right here!

549
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,040
Alright!

550
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,040
Get that!

551
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:34,840
Whoa!

552
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,300
There we go.

553
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,040
Actual one and a half.

554
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,160
There we go.

555
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,720
So you can shoot through walls now.

556
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:44,940
It's the...

557
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,220
Bro.

558
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,220
Alright.

559
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,380
Alright.

560
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,520
It's great.

561
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,020
Now you gotta figure out who to ban.

562
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:51,920
Isn't that great?

563
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,480
Ha ha ha ha.

564
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,000
There's so many things.

565
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,360
Alright.

566
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,600
And then there's...

567
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,440
Oh yeah, the team up.

568
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,140
Let me show you guys the team up for...

569
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,620
For Venom.

570
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,020
So it's like...

571
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,880
Basically he...

572
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,280
When I press X...

573
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,380
He does this.

574
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,700
Be healed!

575
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,360
Yes!

576
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,540
Be healed!

577
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,480
Also, this doesn't stack, by the way.

578
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,300
This does not stack.

579
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,280
So it's like...

580
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,160
I think it's like 4 seconds or something?

581
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,760
Yeah, so that's the Venom team up.

582
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,600
So like, I can heal like 6 people at the same time.

583
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:25,440
Yay!

584
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,520
But they have to be close to me.

585
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,540
Because this is the range.

586
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:29,980
So it's like...

587
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,760
Be healed!

588
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,400
That's right!

589
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,440
Heal yourself!

590
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:34,480
Now!

591
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,060
Nova!

592
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,040
Thank you for tier 1!

593
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,280
So thank you, thank you!

594
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:39,820
But yeah.

595
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,060
That's basically it.

596
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,020
But this...

597
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,300
This is like...

598
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,120
4 seconds, I believe.

599
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,700
1, 2, 3, 4...

600
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,200
Or 5...

601
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,640
6 seconds?

602
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,340
Or is it 6 seconds?

603
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:50,900
Yeah, alright.

604
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,520
But it's like...

605
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,300
Boom.

606
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,380
So it's just that.

607
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:56,940
Yay!

608
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,520
Obviously there's a limit to it.

609
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,460
And then you see the bar?

610
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,220
I can't stay under for too long.

611
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,860
Someone hold me!

612
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,920
I'm scared!

613
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:07,620
Oh!

614
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,500
Wait!

615
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,320
Oh, watch this!

616
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,160
Watch this, guys!

617
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,340
Look how fast I am now!

618
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,520
I'm so fast now!

619
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,540
Can't kill me this time!

620
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,960
I'm zooming!

621
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,860
I'm so fast I can run now!

622
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,220
His one weakness was that he was very slow.

623
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,220
They also buffed his damage too.

624
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,840
He has legs!

625
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,180
He can finally run!

626
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,020
It's crazy!

627
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,140
He doesn't leisurely walk!

628
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,200
It's great!

629
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,480
Now you have to figure out what to ban!

630
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,340
What else can I show you guys?

631
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,880
He runs!

632
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:02,780
Finally!

633
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,900
He has legs!

634
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,980
Rocket Penny?

635
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,000
I guess.

636
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,300
I think this...

637
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,860
I don't think this is quite useful.

638
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,980
Only because, like, if I use this for a res...

639
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,120
Everyone will know where my res is.

640
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,700
So, like...

641
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,560
I don't know.

642
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,100
I feel like people will know where my res is when I use it.

643
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:26,880
So, I don't know.

644
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,560
I don't know how useful this really is because of it.

645
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,320
Um...

646
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,780
But it's...

647
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,560
I mean, it's for Penny to have two things.

648
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:36,480
Yeah.

649
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,280
Uh...

650
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,440
Yeah, I feel like it's gonna be found much more easily.

651
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,560
And then they're still just gonna destroy it in general.

652
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:45,640
Uh...

653
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:46,640
So...

654
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:47,760
Uh...

655
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,520
Penny...

656
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,220
Yeah, it's just for...

657
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,260
I feel like it's more so for Penny-wise.

658
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:51,620
Oh, yeah.

659
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,960
I'll show you the team up for Widow.

660
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,780
It goes through, by the way.

661
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:56,560
Watch.

662
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,340
See?

663
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:00,720
I...

664
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,840
I think it pierces, right?

665
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,480
No, it doesn't pierce.

666
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:03,700
Sorry.

667
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,200
JK.

668
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,060
It doesn't pier...

669
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:05,580
Wait, does it?

670
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,500
No, it does.

671
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,640
I think it pierces.

672
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,160
You have to zoom in, though.

673
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,400
Let me get rid of these.

674
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,980
You have to...

675
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,080
You have to zoom in.

676
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,720
It does.

677
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,560
Okay, so...

678
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,460
It pierces.

679
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,180
That's basically it.

680
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:20,760
And you can't...

681
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:21,420
Yeah.

682
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,000
Oh my god!

683
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:24,780
He went from...

684
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,700
She went from F tier to D tier.

685
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,880
Oh my god, guys.

686
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:28,660
We did it.

687
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,480
We...

688
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,720
We did it, guys.

689
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,080
She went up one tier.

690
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,380
We...

691
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:41,890
Improvement.

692
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,330
Oh my god.

693
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,350
I think this is the serious.

694
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,470
Nobody can shoot a gun.

695
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,590
This is what made me laugh the most.

696
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:49,390
That takes skill.

697
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:55,450
This one is the silliest of them all.

698
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:56,750
Wait, can I do this?

699
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:01,510
So silly.

700
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,490
That is very silly.

701
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:14,130
I know like, when it happens to me, it's no longer gonna be silly anymore.

702
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:18,930
Lucky for you guys, the cooldown for it is 20 seconds.

703
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:23,750
Yeah.

704
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:26,990
It's 20 seconds.

705
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:27,610
Yeah.

706
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,010
It's 20 seconds.

707
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:29,350
It's 20 second cooldown.

708
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:30,530
So...

709
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:33,150
It's not that bad, but it's...

710
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,150
Imagine if you're just...

711
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:42,010
If you die to a Hawkeye, and then you look at the kill cam, and he was literally just...

712
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:43,950
Look...

713
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:48,950
Just, you know, doing simple geometry in his head.

714
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,210
And then...

715
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:50,590
Yeah.

716
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:58,070
Like, he's like calculating the angles, and like, algebra equations, and physics, and it was just right here.

717
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:59,010
And...

718
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:00,690
It was...

719
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:01,890
It was...

720
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:02,730
Right here.

721
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,450
Looking sharp.

722
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:08,010
If I die to something like that...

723
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,630
I think he deserves that kill.

724
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:11,770
Because...

725
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,630
He...

726
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:13,410
Clearly...

727
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,310
Clearly...

728
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:16,450
I feel like he deserves it, you know?

729
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,890
Like, he worked so hard for that kill.

730
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:19,830
If he...

731
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:23,490
He got...

732
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:26,610
I got trigonometry or some shit.

733
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,970
Like, he deserves it at that point.

734
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,290
If he can do all that.

735
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:31,730
Uh...

736
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:32,990
Pro to the math.

737
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:37,170
I'm just out here playing the game, and he's doing his math final right now.

738
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,010
Uh...

739
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:41,990
He's just out here doing his math final.

740
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:44,430
This is three shots.

741
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,150
So you can see, like...

742
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,490
Oh yeah, I forgot to...

743
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,070
Let me...

744
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,150
I just realized something.

745
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,610
I forgot to do something.

746
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,550
I forgot to show something important.

747
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,490
Which is...

748
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,110
He he ha ha.

749
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:57,290
Which is...

750
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:58,950
This...

751
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:59,810
Goodbye, Jeff.

752
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,490
I'm more important than you.

753
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,650
And I'll guess this too.

754
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:06,190
I...

755
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,230
Alright.

756
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:08,870
But yes.

757
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,410
Not that much.

758
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:13,430
To be fair, it doesn't really matter when I can do this.

759
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,570
Okay, it might not look impressive.

760
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:16,950
But imagine there's three of them.

761
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,170
You don't have to imagine right now.

762
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:22,110
Imagine you're healing your teammates.

763
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:22,810
You know?

764
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,470
They're in front of you.

765
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,850
And you're healing your teammates.

766
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:28,310
and you can also damage them?

767
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:29,730
In a Braum fight?

768
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:30,450
In a Braum fight?

769
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,050
That's pretty convenient.

770
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:33,610
In my opinion.

771
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,050
Like...

772
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:35,530
Of course.

773
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:41,970
They are all just bunched up together?

774
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,990
And you can just do that?

775
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:48,410
I mean, that seems very convenient right there.

776
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,770
When they all get bunched up.

777
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:56,170
You think a tank is going to save you?

778
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,650
It doesn't matter.

779
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:04,570
Tanks, yeah, but then like, I can damage as well for my left click.

780
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,130
That's right.

781
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:12,110
A tank is not going to save you now.

782
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,690
Yeah, it's basically a blameter.

783
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:19,890
Alright, what else do you guys want to see, guys?

784
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,090
What else do you guys want to see?

785
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:23,850
That's on Ultron?

786
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:28,030
I think a lot of people are going to play Ultron, like, as a DPS.

787
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:33,350
But if he actually is going to be healing, he has to play with his team.

788
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:35,830
He has to play with his team.

789
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:36,590
Oh, yeah.

790
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:39,390
Let me show you guys the... I'll show you guys.

791
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,070
The... Here, there's the blade.

792
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:49,850
Alright, so apparently what I read about... Alright, let me get on Star-Lord.

793
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,410
What I read about Star-Lord.

794
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:53,890
Weeeeee.

795
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,230
Weeeeee.

796
00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:01,350
Alright, so this used to be... From what I remember, it was 30, right?

797
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,510
This used to be his old Ult range.

798
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:04,650
You can be here.

799
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:08,550
It can be here, and then that was as far as you can go.

800
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:11,850
You can now do this Ult all the way here.

801
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,650
So let me get Ult real fast.

802
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:15,010
Actually, no.

803
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,270
Let me just do no cooldown.

804
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:16,950
What am I doing?

805
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,030
Alright.

806
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:20,810
I can be here.

807
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:24,050
Yeah, this is as far as we can do it.

808
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:25,190
So now it's 40.

809
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:27,050
In the past, it's 30.

810
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,710
Now it's at 40.

811
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,630
Now my leg.

812
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,450
Just Luna Ult forehead.

813
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,490
What do you mean?

814
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:38,810
Just Luna Ult.

815
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:42,210
Yeah.

816
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:44,570
So...

817
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:46,910
So that's basically his new Ult form.

818
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:53,690
What else?

819
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:54,750
What else do you guys want to see?

820
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:56,510
Guys, is there anything else?

821
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:01,790
I'm tired of being the tickle monster.

822
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,450
As a sword port main?

823
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:04,310
No.

824
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,870
Be a tickle monster forever.

825
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:15,170
I don't care about your opinions.

826
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:19,990
Alright.

827
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,150
Let's see.

828
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,250
I don't know.

829
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,970
I know like this changed.

830
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,250
I don't really know.

831
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:25,970
I don't play sword.

832
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:26,590
So I don't know.

833
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,150
You guys might understand what he is.

834
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,950
You guys might understand.

835
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:31,330
This is the new thing.

836
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:32,090
The right click.

837
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:35,230
The right click is different from what I know.

838
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:38,790
But I don't know actually what is actually different.

839
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,450
But yeah.

840
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,350
The right click is...

841
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,790
This is what they added.

842
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:48,090
Yeah.

843
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,290
It doesn't cost resources.

844
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:49,610
Yeah.

845
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:50,190
But the cooldown.

846
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:51,390
As you guys can see.

847
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,150
Is...

848
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,230
Five seconds.

849
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:56,490
It's five seconds instead.

850
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:56,790
Sorry.

851
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:57,970
Thank you for the tier one sub.

852
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:58,390
Thank you.

853
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:58,830
Thank you.

854
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,230
Angry Kid and Robotic.

855
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:01,490
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

856
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:01,950
Thank you.

857
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:02,710
Thank you.

858
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:03,730
Um.

859
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:04,310
Alright.

860
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,350
What other stuff did they do?

861
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:08,370
Uh...

862
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:09,390
Let's see.

863
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,470
What other stuff can I show you guys?

864
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:13,690
Uh...

865
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:13,890
Oh yeah.

866
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,230
For those who didn't see Ultron.

867
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,690
This is the new skin by the way.

868
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:17,670
Luna...

869
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,650
Luna has nothing new.

870
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:19,950
Is there...

871
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:20,130
I...

872
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:21,250
I don't think Luna...

873
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:21,570
They didn't...

874
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:22,510
They didn't change Luna.

875
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,250
She feels the same for me.

876
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,550
I think she feels the same.

877
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,690
I think it's just...

878
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:29,850
Maybe damage and heals?

879
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:30,810
But...

880
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:33,830
I don't...

881
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:34,690
Find her...

882
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:35,350
Much different.

883
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:36,750
Um...

884
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:37,390
The freeze?

885
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:39,550
I think the freeze is mostly...

886
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:41,350
Yeah.

887
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:42,450
I feel like...

888
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,470
I feel like Luna doesn't feel that different from...

889
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,870
From how I usually play her.

890
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:49,010
No.

891
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:49,950
She...

892
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:52,250
275 HP just feels the same.

893
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:55,910
Oh, she gets freeze from...

894
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:56,530
Oh, okay.

895
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:57,650
I see it now.

896
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,990
So, you just have to hit your freezes.

897
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,870
By the way, it's been a while since I played Luna.

898
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:02,670
So, like...

899
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,550
This is gonna be interesting.

900
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,410
But I wanna play Jeff, though.

901
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:08,730
I wanna...

902
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:10,410
Jeff seems so fun.

903
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:13,750
Not gonna lie.

904
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:14,270
I...

905
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,710
I swear I wanna play Jeff.

906
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,290
He seems...

907
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:19,630
He seems so fun.

908
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:21,330
If I get a Storm, I'll play...

909
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:22,550
Um...

910
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,410
I'll play Jeff.

911
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:24,970
Because I think she'll...

912
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:26,510
Yummy Yummy will only...

913
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,230
Be fun.

914
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:28,450
Um...

915
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:28,610
Only...

916
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,330
Will only be fun when I have a Storm.

917
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,370
Because I can be a Jeffnado.

918
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:33,710
But yeah.

919
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:34,330
I get a shield.

920
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,030
I think that's her only difference, right?

921
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,210
She gets a shield.

922
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,470
From her freezes.

923
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:38,870
Yeah.

924
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:40,030
That's a lot.

925
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,430
From 275 to 325.

926
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,670
Play Jeff for the funny.

927
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,610
But if I get a Hawkeye, I'll play Luna.

928
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,510
I'll play Luna if I get a Hawkeye.

929
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:52,130
Because I think Necrose is gonna wanna play Ultron.

930
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:53,570
I'm pretty sure.

931
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,850
But I wanna play Ultron too.

932
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,230
We'll swap between.

933
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,330
Yeah, Necrose is gonna be on my team and he's on support duty apparently.

934
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,450
I don't know if that was his choice.

935
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:03,790
Or...

936
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:05,910
I don't know.

937
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:08,710
I don't know if that's his choice to play...

938
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:12,130
To wanna be a support player for the team thing.

939
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:14,470
Cause on the thing, he like...

940
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:16,130
He wrote himself as support.

941
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,370
So I don't know.

942
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:18,030
I...

943
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,910
But yeah, I can show you guys Ultron again.

944
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:27,330
So, for those who didn't know...

945
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:27,950
Watch this.

946
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:30,310
This is my favorite part when I show Ultron to people.

947
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,130
And then people...

948
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:33,590
I'd be like, hee hee, that's funny.

949
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,770
And then everybody would be like, that's not funny.

950
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:36,830
But I'm like...

951
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:37,290
Oh, wait.

952
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:37,590
Here.

953
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:40,170
This is a better guide on how far his range is.

954
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,110
Uh...

955
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:44,290
Let me...

956
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:45,110
Here.

957
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:47,110
I'll show you guys a better demonstration.

958
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:48,190
Alright.

959
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:50,010
Alright.

960
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:50,610
You see that guy?

961
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,950
Watch me slowly back out.

962
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:56,030
You see him?

963
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:59,550
I'm gonna slowly back out now.

964
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,170
You see that?

965
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:07,130
You see how I'm slowly backing out?

966
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:08,530
You see...

967
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:10,750
You see that?

968
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:11,630
Whoa!

969
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:15,330
Why is this so far?

970
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:17,310
I'm still so far away!

971
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:18,430
Whoa!

972
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,790
And now let me kill that one guy.

973
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:25,450
Wait, where is he?

974
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,270
Let me kill him too.

975
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,770
Let me kill this guy too.

976
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:28,750
Whoa!

977
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,270
That's pretty silly.

978
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:31,650
I killed him too.

979
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:35,050
What?

980
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,090
Now...

981
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:37,210
Okay.

982
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:38,770
So this is his team up.

983
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:40,530
Oh, wait.

984
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,070
I killed him.

985
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:41,330
Sorry.

986
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:41,730
He...

987
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:42,330
Give me a sec.

988
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:44,210
Okay.

989
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:44,950
Alright.

990
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,330
So you're coming back from spawn and you're like, Oh no!

991
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,050
My teammates!

992
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:48,950
Don't worry!

993
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,470
I'll heal you.

994
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,370
I can damage him too.

995
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:52,970
I can damage him too if I want to.

996
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:54,770
There we go.

997
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:58,110
So you can literally be like...

998
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:02,750
You're like dead on spawn and then you're all the way from spawn and you're like, Don't worry!

999
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:03,550
I sh...

1000
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,330
Oh, he's dead.

1001
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:05,230
Give me a sec.

1002
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,410
Give me a sec.

1003
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:10,410
Don't worry!

1004
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,050
I'll heal you this time.

1005
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,510
And then...

1006
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,870
And then...

1007
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,010
You save the game.

1008
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:16,750
You're a hero.

1009
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:18,290
Congratulations.

1010
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,170
You're a hero now.

1011
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:21,470
Yippee!

1012
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,630
Yeah, that's my favorite part of the show.

1013
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:30,710
Show people.

1014
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:30,910
Blah.

1015
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:33,430
And then everyone clapped.

1016
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,630
Those beings appear to be...

1017
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:45,570
Yeah, without the team up, this is his only heals.

1018
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:46,990
And the right click.

1019
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,530
It's this and the right click.

1020
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,070
But there's a range to the drones.

1021
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,390
If you guys didn't want to hear earlier, this is the range.

1022
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:56,990
It's right here, I think.

1023
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:58,830
No, it's...

1024
00:40:58,830 --> 00:40:59,230
There you go.

1025
00:40:59,230 --> 00:40:59,990
That's the range.

1026
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:04,590
So the moment you're, like, this far away from the drone, it despawns.

1027
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:06,050
So you have to...

1028
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:09,130
You have to be close to your team and you want to use...

1029
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:10,710
This is literally your only heals, by the way.

1030
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,310
There's no other way to heal your team.

1031
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,030
Because your...

1032
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:15,110
Your left click is just to fight.

1033
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:17,070
Your left click...

1034
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:19,210
Your left click is just to be like...

1035
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:19,530
Pew pew!

1036
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:20,990
Pew pew!

1037
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,650
I have to learn how to do the diamond too.

1038
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:25,510
This sucks.

1039
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,070
I don't play support...

1040
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,150
I don't play support flyers.

1041
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,570
Because this is the first support flyer.

1042
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,350
So I have to learn how to do this.

1043
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,110
When I'm playing.

1044
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,990
So it's harder to hit me.

1045
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,350
Oh my god.

1046
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:39,130
Because you can't...

1047
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,450
You can't WA spam.

1048
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:41,690
You have to do this.

1049
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:42,730
You have to fly in a...

1050
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:44,330
God damn diamond shape.

1051
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:47,070
Stupid fucking diamond flying.

1052
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:53,550
Oh yeah.

1053
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:53,930
Don't worry.

1054
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:54,670
I'll show you guys.

1055
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:58,590
I keep forgetting that you don't have to go to spawn.

1056
00:41:58,890 --> 00:41:59,770
How do you use emotes?

1057
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,650
I proudly wear the X.

1058
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:02,930
That's right.

1059
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:03,810
Make it.

1060
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:04,150
Oh wait.

1061
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:04,790
Luna Snow.

1062
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:05,930
That's...

1063
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,370
That's right, Luna.

1064
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:10,010
That's right.

1065
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,010
Dance, Luna.

1066
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:11,890
Dance!

1067
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:15,650
Dance, Luna!

1068
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:15,810
No!

1069
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:16,870
Hahaha!

1070
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:20,230
Is it time now?

1071
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:21,510
I thought it was at 3.

1072
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:23,750
Is it time?

1073
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,350
Dance for me, Luna!

1074
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:27,390
Okay.

1075
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,010
Let me see.

1076
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:29,370
Let me check Discord.

1077
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:30,630
I don't know if it's time yet.

1078
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:32,890
It's not time.

1079
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:33,730
Yeah.

1080
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:35,330
Um...

1081
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:35,490
No.

1082
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:36,390
We have 10 more minutes.

1083
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:38,490
We have 10 more minutes.

1084
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:38,770
Yeah.

1085
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:40,210
Uh...

1086
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:41,350
It starts at...

1087
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:41,990
Um...

1088
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:42,490
2.50.

1089
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:42,890
But yeah.

1090
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:44,910
I love this.

1091
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:46,170
Emote.

1092
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:47,190
This is...

1093
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,990
This would be my only emote that I ever buy.

1094
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:50,270
And actually, no.

1095
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:51,110
The Venom one too.

1096
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:52,570
But I didn't buy that one.

1097
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:53,290
I...

1098
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:53,690
Hahaha!

1099
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:55,250
Dance!

1100
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:56,230
Yes!

1101
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:57,270
Wait.

1102
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:58,250
You're too far away.

1103
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:00,390
Wait, actually.

1104
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:02,630
I'll do something even better.

1105
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:08,030
Dance, Venom!

1106
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:08,890
Hahaha!

1107
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:13,950
Dance, Venom!

1108
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:14,790
Yes!

1109
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:16,570
Dance for your queen!

1110
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:18,230
Dance!

1111
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:19,370
Shake it for me!

1112
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:20,370
Haha!

1113
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:23,410
Were there any Groot changes?

1114
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:23,970
Yes.

1115
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:24,670
He's dead.

1116
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:25,990
Goodbye, Groot.

1117
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:26,930
Yippee!

1118
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:29,130
I don't even need to show Groot.

1119
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:29,810
He's nerfed.

1120
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:30,790
Haha!

1121
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:32,610
Don't even try playing Groot.

1122
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:33,370
He's just dead.

1123
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:34,650
You know why?

1124
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:35,710
Let me show you why.

1125
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,070
I just have to pick this guy.

1126
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,150
A blunt instrument.

1127
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,110
He...

1128
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:41,430
He...

1129
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:41,950
He...

1130
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,430
Watch this.

1131
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:47,710
Goodbye.

1132
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:49,190
Hahahaha!

1133
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:52,830
So I don't even need to try him.

1134
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:53,850
Hahahaha!

1135
00:43:58,740 --> 00:43:59,140
Goodbye.

1136
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,840
Goodbye, Groot.

1137
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,160
Hahahaha!

1138
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,920
Just pick Punisher.

1139
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,140
Hahahaha!

1140
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,220
Just pick Punisher, that's all you have to do.

1141
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,260
Cause they buffed...

1142
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,220
They buffed Punisher's...

1143
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:11,160
Okay.

1144
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,120
This is what it's like with...

1145
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:12,680
No...

1146
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:13,700
I also didn't have to reload.

1147
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,100
This was like...

1148
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:16,880
I still killed him.

1149
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I didn't even have to reload.

1150
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,860
I don't even have to reload, guys.

1151
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:21,980
I still killed him.

1152
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,240
In one mag.

1153
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,300
And then...

1154
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:28,520
There you go.

1155
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:29,900
Alright.

1156
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:30,460
There.

1157
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:31,580
So that's why...

1158
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,340
That's why I don't even need to show any...

1159
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,720
Show Groot for you guys.

1160
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,080
Cause...

1161
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,460
Trees are gone now.

1162
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,660
Team Trees?

1163
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,120
More like...

1164
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,180
Team Fire.

1165
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,220
Hahahaha!

1166
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:43,940
Hahahaha!

1167
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:45,080
Hahahaha!

1168
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:45,740
Hahahaha!

1169
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:47,500
Now, uh...

1170
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,980
They buffed Punisher's damage.

1171
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,060
And they nerfed...

1172
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,280
Groot's, uh...

1173
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,620
They nerfed Groot's cooldowns.

1174
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,300
So like...

1175
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:53,740
It's not...

1176
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:55,400
He's not his cooldown...

1177
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,380
It takes longer to build up his...

1178
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:58,360
Walls and stuff like that.

1179
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,320
Um...

1180
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:00,600
Yay!

1181
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:03,460
Deforestation!

1182
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:04,100
Yay!

1183
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,480
Hehehehe!

1184
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:08,100
And then Punisher is obviously like...

1185
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,620
Super strong against Groot now.

1186
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:11,740
Um...

1187
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,080
But they nerfed the...

1188
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:13,400
They...

1189
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,360
They got rid of...

1190
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,720
Like they made the cooldown longer.

1191
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:16,440
Which is great!

1192
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,560
I hate...

1193
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,480
I hated that.

1194
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:19,100
Hahahaha!

1195
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,060
Uh...

1196
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,400
Uh...

1197
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:25,580
Um...

1198
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:25,940
Um...

1199
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:27,720
I can't wait to play Jeff, guys.

1200
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,060
Wahaaaah!

1201
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:30,980
Hahahaha!

1202
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:33,420
That's my favorite!

1203
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:36,260
Wahaaaah!

1204
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:37,820
Hahahaha!

1205
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:39,060
Yay!

1206
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:45,620
I can finally, finally, because I don't know how to play DPS Jeff.

1207
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:52,860
I have no idea how to play DPS Jeff because like I'm way too much of a support player.

1208
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:57,420
I just want to save my team instead of trying to flank.

1209
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:58,760
That's too much pressure for me.

1210
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:01,260
You want to see the Jeffnado again?

1211
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:01,700
Alright.

1212
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:15,340
So the greatest part about Jeffnado is that you can eat them and then... Oh wait, I forgot to... You can eat them and then... Let me restart that.

1213
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,060
I'll restart.

1214
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:26,820
Okay, so the best part is that you can eat them and then they can't kill you because you can just be protected by the storm mineral.

1215
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:28,720
So I can be like this.

1216
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:29,720
I'm trying to swim away.

1217
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,680
I'll be like, save me!

1218
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,780
And then... He's dead.

1219
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:36,860
He's dead.

1220
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:42,120
And anybody that gets sucked up in a Jeffnado, um... Gets eaten by me.

1221
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,120
So you can see that he disappeared.

1222
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,660
It's because he got eaten by me.

1223
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,880
So I can be like, um... And then, save me Storm!

1224
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:55,900
And then Storm can just pick me up and then take me away.

1225
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:57,520
Yeah.

1226
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,260
So he can just... And then he'll just take me away and then I'll be safe.

1227
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,140
So it guarantees kills.

1228
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,720
So, like, you don't have to run away right now anymore.

1229
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,780
No, so, like, you don't have to jump off the edge.

1230
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,920
You can just be like, pick me up, mom!

1231
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:13,840
Pick me up!

1232
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,360
So you don't have to be like, oh, where's the edge?

1233
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,100
Where's the edge?

1234
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,500
And then, like, spit them out.

1235
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:21,660
You just be like, mom!

1236
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,800
Mom, pick me up!

1237
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:29,300
And then Storm comes in and be like... Because I can be like, oh my god, he's gonna kill me!

1238
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,420
And then, I'm like, I'm safe now.

1239
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:32,080
Yay!

1240
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:36,340
Yay!

1241
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,460
This is the second guy, by the way.

1242
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,720
Because the first guy died.

1243
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,180
The first guy died.

1244
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:46,820
So, uh...

1245
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:50,560
Yippee!

1246
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:57,640
So, if you're, like, wondering, the first guy I picked... The guy I picked up died, like, in, like, three to four seconds in the Storm all.

1247
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:59,640
Because when I... Whoever I...

1248
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,100
Picked up... Okay, so...

1249
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:02,420
Here's the interesting part.

1250
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,260
Alright, let's see.

1251
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,100
I'll pick him up.

1252
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,240
And then...

1253
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,080
I go, like, here.

1254
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,980
And then I can extend my ult.

1255
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,080
And Storm extends her ult, too.

1256
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:12,640
Can you see?

1257
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:13,580
It went six seconds.

1258
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,560
So, whenever I go to Storm...

1259
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,880
So, I could have the... I could have the people in my belly...

1260
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,980
For almost the entire duration of my own ult.

1261
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,180
But the moment I pick... Go into the Storm...

1262
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,980
It extends the ult even longer.

1263
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,580
Because it gives a plus six seconds extension.

1264
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:32,460
So...

1265
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:33,560
That's why I was like, ooh.

1266
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,020
That's silly.

1267
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:37,980
That's...

1268
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,480
That's silly.

1269
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:45,720
It's pretty silly, guys.

1270
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:48,820
But I still think this is the silliest.

1271
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:51,580
This is the silliest for me.

1272
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:52,620
My years away from the Avengers...

1273
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:54,140
Taught me how much they meant to me.

1274
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:55,960
Eee.

1275
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:00,640
Yay!

1276
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,020
God, no.

1277
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,800
Ice arrow unleashed!

1278
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,640
Yay!

1279
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:11,740
Wait, what if I...

1280
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,740
Calculate this?

1281
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:13,100
Okay.

1282
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:14,940
Okay, it's like here.

1283
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,220
I hit him?

1284
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,280
I can't tell.

1285
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:20,200
Can I calculate this?

1286
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,480
Wait, that's not how arrows work.

1287
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:31,480
Yeah, but they're magic arrows.

1288
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,960
They're magic arrows.

1289
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,860
Bro, I want to see a montage of these kills.

1290
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:37,820
I...

1291
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:44,200
I want to see all the montages of this.

1292
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,100
Hawkeye technically isn't using the magic.

1293
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,700
The arrows itself is the magic.

1294
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:56,100
Do not encourage them.

1295
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:57,680
Yippee!

1296
00:49:58,960 --> 00:49:59,860
Yeah, this...

1297
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:02,920
I think montages are gonna look so sick though.

1298
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:03,660
All right.

1299
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:04,700
All right.

1300
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,220
All right.

1301
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:05,240
All right.

1302
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,920
But if you guys want to check out the game...

1303
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:07,840
The pad...

1304
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,900
The official update comes out on May 30th.

1305
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,040
So yeah, you click on the link.

1306
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,440
You can check out the...

1307
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:16,700
You can check out the newest updates on May 30th, guys.

1308
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,140
Just remember, it's free to play.

1309
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,080
I think it's almost time.

1310
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:20,960
Let me double check.

1311
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,140
Um...

1312
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:23,260
Oh!

1313
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:24,340
We gotta join Discord.

1314
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:24,840
All right.

1315
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:25,720
Give me a sec, guys.

1316
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,160
I'm gonna head over to the Discord.

1317
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,400
That's a lie.

1318
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,560
Not everybody's here yet.

1319
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:33,480
Sorry.

1320
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:34,940
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

1321
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,240
I was just making a joke.

1322
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,480
The staff member was like, Everyone's in Team B.

1323
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,640
Sorry, I didn't...

1324
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:40,300
I was joking.

1325
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:41,320
JK, JK.

1326
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,880
It was like my intrusive thoughts.

1327
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:46,560
I love Marvel rivals.

1328
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,240
Heads up, bad guys.

1329
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:50,940
Oh, hello, hello.

1330
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:53,760
Eh.

1331
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:56,860
Yup, yup, yup.

1332
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:58,500
Ooh!

1333
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:58,740
Ooh!

1334
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:00,260
Let's go!

1335
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,320
My boys!

1336
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:03,160
I need a...

1337
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:03,900
Look at those subs.

1338
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:04,800
Oh, wait, I gotta...

1339
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:05,720
Oh my god, that's a lot.

1340
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,380
Guys, I gotta reset my Discord.

1341
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,120
Give me a sec.

1342
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,300
I need to do the push to talk.

1343
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,060
So rich and generated.

1344
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,580
Um, why is this like such a specific amount?

1345
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,940
Wait, we can take over the directory here, guys.

1346
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,480
Oh, no, no, no, you're sharing chats.

1347
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,400
Oh, sharing chats!

1348
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,440
My chat are like polar opposite.

1349
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,720
I've never shared chats before.

1350
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,620
Yeah, I feel like...

1351
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,780
Yeah, this is like mixing fire and water.

1352
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,000
It's gotta be good.

1353
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:30,200
It's gotta be good.

1354
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:30,780
We can...

1355
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,320
Um, no, I'm assuming it's gonna be a contrast.

1356
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:32,960
Which one's mine?

1357
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,820
I can tell which one's gonna be my chat.

1358
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:35,640
I...

1359
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:36,800
Oh, you think so?

1360
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:37,860
Uh...

1361
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:40,140
I don't know.

1362
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,920
My chat is kind of like very overwhelming.

1363
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,680
Why are you so ashamed of your chat, Necros?

1364
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:44,600
Your chat is cool.

1365
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:45,440
Wait, okay.

1366
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,680
I need to like...

1367
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:47,740
I need to restart my Discord.

1368
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:48,660
Do you think this is readable?

1369
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:49,560
They don't just seem like...

1370
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:50,040
Oh, man.

1371
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,340
Like, I'm just reading all my Discord stuff.

1372
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,160
It's not readable anyway.

1373
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:53,240
That's true.

1374
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:53,760
It's too many people.

1375
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:54,200
Oh, my God.

1376
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:54,680
Sound...

1377
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,300
Sound team.

1378
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,360
Wait, what are we missing right now?

1379
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:56,700
DM me...

1380
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,760
DM me to tell me who I need to raise up and who I don't.

1381
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:00,220
But don't worry.

1382
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:01,560
I'm setting up the stuff now.

1383
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:03,680
Yeah, this is needed right now.

1384
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:04,620
Where is this?

1385
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,100
Where is the server even called?

1386
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:07,620
I don't even remember.

1387
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,660
I got to find this server too.

1388
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,280
What is this server called?

1389
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:16,520
Oh, my God.

1390
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:17,340
Where is it?

1391
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,160
I cannot read any of that.

1392
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:23,400
How many messages do you read like a day?

1393
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,100
I don't know.

1394
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,500
It isn't usually this fast.

1395
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:29,340
It's pretty fast.

1396
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:30,600
But it isn't this fast.

1397
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:31,840
I'm not doing this.

1398
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:32,440
All right, there you go.

1399
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:33,500
I told you.

1400
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,220
I told you it's not readable.

1401
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,340
That was overwhelming.

1402
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,460
There you go.

1403
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:37,800
Yeah.

1404
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:40,380
Now you see the HP in there.

1405
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,220
It's just like a whole bunch of sabow, sabow, thighs, thighs.

1406
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:43,900
I don't know.

1407
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:45,960
Okay, you guys don't need to see my HP.

1408
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:46,920
It's because it's all the bop, right?

1409
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:48,820
Yeah, it's the viewbot.

1410
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:49,260
It's the viewbot.

1411
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,920
Yo, press one if you're a viewbot.

1412
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:52,420
Press one.

1413
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:53,040
Okay.

1414
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:53,780
One.

1415
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:54,720
One.

1416
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,420
I'm already typing one.

1417
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,320
Okay, bring necros down.

1418
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:57,780
Okay.

1419
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,480
I'm just fixing the sound, guys.

1420
00:52:59,820 --> 00:52:59,940
Oh, my God.

1421
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,620
Bring necros down.

1422
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:02,820
Okay, I brought him down.

1423
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,620
Don't worry, sound team is...

1424
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:05,180
What are you talking about over here?

1425
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,160
Sound team is helping me right now.

1426
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,320
Why are we doing one?

1427
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:09,660
Oh, my God.

1428
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:10,420
I was too busy.

1429
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,140
I don't know why I was pressing one.

1430
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:12,860
People are excited.

1431
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,340
They're so excited about this.

1432
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:15,100
I'm amped.

1433
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:15,340
Yeah.

1434
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:16,600
Hi, Steven.

1435
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:17,680
I gotta restart my Discord.

1436
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:18,540
I'll be right back.

1437
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:19,600
All right.

1438
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:20,100
Yeah, go ahead.

1439
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:23,000
Wait, Andrew has 150...

1440
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,940
All right, let me restart my Discord.

1441
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,260
I need to do admin mode, because I need to push to mute.

1442
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:32,660
All right, here we go.

1443
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:34,460
All right.

1444
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,100
I don't know.

1445
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,260
I don't even know what was going on.

1446
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,060
Okay, mute button.

1447
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,780
Where the heck is my mute button?

1448
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,240
Sorry, guys.

1449
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,360
I gotta figure all of this out.

1450
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,000
All right.

1451
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:50,940
We got company.

1452
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:51,420
What?

1453
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:52,640
What's that?

1454
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:54,220
Who said that?

1455
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,160
Oh, wait.

1456
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:58,380
I was like, who said that?

1457
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,740
That scared me.

1458
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:01,840
Okay.

1459
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,800
See, add a key button.

1460
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:08,460
Wait, does Hawkeye say that?

1461
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:09,780
I was like, who's that?

1462
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:12,500
I was like, who's that?

1463
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:13,660
Who's that freak?

1464
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:16,960
I'll use V.

1465
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:20,360
Is V anything on Rivals?

1466
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,320
I don't know.

1467
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:24,740
Let's see.

1468
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:27,280
I gotta make sure I don't actually press anything.

1469
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,940
Is V anything on Rivals, guys?

1470
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:32,400
Melee?

1471
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,600
Okay, I re-binded that.

1472
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:33,920
All right.

1473
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:37,000
My mute, push to mute would be V then.

1474
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,180
All right, nice.

1475
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,400
All right, we're all good to go.

1476
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,820
Uh, I could run the Ultron for us.

1477
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,080
Hey, I'm back.

1478
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,000
Honestly, honestly, they wanted me...

1479
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,500
I'll do the first game and then, uh, Doki, because we're supposed to play Strata, just then you can try it if you want.

1480
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:55,340
All right, yeah, yeah.

1481
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:56,540
I'll do it after you, Necros.

1482
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,380
I'll play Jeff first, then.

1483
00:54:59,060 --> 00:54:59,580
Jeff seems fun.

1484
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,700
Wait, we need to do the Jeff Storm team up.

1485
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,220
That shit was so funny.

1486
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:03,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1487
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:06,180
Because it adds plus six seconds to the storm mode.

1488
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:11,780
And then whoever I eat, whoever I eat gets the storm damage when I'm in it.

1489
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,200
Am I in this cold?

1490
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,380
Sorry, or am I in all the cold?

1491
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,880
Yeah, you're in this one.

1492
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:17,960
You're with us, you're with us.

1493
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:18,500
This is our team.

1494
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:19,380
Hey, guys, how you doing?

1495
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:19,680
I'm amazing.

1496
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:23,060
Hey, where's the custom room for it?

1497
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,340
Can you just join us, Doki?

1498
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,020
Oh, yeah.

1499
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:26,720
It's a custom game.

1500
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:29,320
It's like the season 2.5 starts on May 30th room.

1501
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:29,860
That one.

1502
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:30,660
A what?

1503
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,810
Season 2.5 starts on May 30th.

1504
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:43,890
Wait, I'm not even the last person.

1505
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:45,110
Who are you waiting for?

1506
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:47,710
Rage, I think.

1507
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:48,810
Not last.

1508
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:52,590
Wait, we lost your chat, Nekros.

1509
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:56,670
Are we all already added as friends on these accounts?

1510
00:55:58,310 --> 00:55:59,010
You want them back?

1511
00:55:59,170 --> 00:55:59,710
Yeah, we can run it.

1512
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:03,410
All right, Nekros, we're going to need you to come back.

1513
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:04,610
Huh?

1514
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:05,430
What do you mean, come back?

1515
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:06,790
Oh, you want my chat?

1516
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:07,750
Yeah, you know what?

1517
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:08,570
What do you mean?

1518
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:09,570
You just said you didn't want it.

1519
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:10,110
You just kicked it.

1520
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:11,630
No, I just need a little break.

1521
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:12,450
I just need a little break.

1522
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:13,110
You need a little break?

1523
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:15,590
All right, I'm going to turn down Nekros a little bit more.

1524
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:16,630
Ease into it, bro.

1525
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:19,090
All right, let me know if everything is good.

1526
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:19,870
Enjoy.

1527
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:21,510
All right, I'm here for Jeff now.

1528
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:24,390
By the way, I don't play Jeff, but it's good.

1529
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:26,650
Are we added as friends already?

1530
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:28,150
Or do we want to close the mattress home?

1531
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:32,970
I am not a Jeff there, but it's going to be an example.

1532
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:34,270
Yeah, an experience.

1533
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:39,090
But like, it seems fun.

1534
00:56:39,350 --> 00:56:41,870
Literally, I played every character but Jeff.

1535
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:44,470
Jeff was like the old because he was like DPS Jeff.

1536
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:46,870
I was like, blanking Jeff is too much effort.

1537
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:51,550
Oh, everyone.

1538
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:52,390
Discord is too loud.

1539
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:53,390
I'll turn it down a little.

1540
00:56:53,730 --> 00:56:53,970
Okay, okay.

1541
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:55,190
Let me know if it's better.

1542
00:56:55,770 --> 00:56:56,330
Who's on the other team?

1543
00:56:56,510 --> 00:56:56,790
That's comp.

1544
00:56:56,930 --> 00:56:57,890
Who's comp on the other team?

1545
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:58,190
Yeah, yeah.

1546
00:56:58,250 --> 00:56:59,290
They said they won quick match.

1547
00:56:59,370 --> 00:56:59,850
They don't want comp.

1548
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:00,870
All right, guys.

1549
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:01,370
All right.

1550
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:02,070
AJ.

1551
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:03,190
Let me know if it's better.

1552
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:04,890
I lowered the Discord volume too.

1553
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:05,530
You ready?

1554
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:07,590
Nah, not at all, man.

1555
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:08,390
I'm rusty, bro.

1556
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:09,010
I'm not going to lie.

1557
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:10,090
What's the last time you played?

1558
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:10,870
What's the last time you played?

1559
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:12,110
Weeks ago, bro.

1560
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:13,990
Good luck.

1561
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:20,710
I'm a diamond solo queue, which means I'm essentially a Celestial, bro.

1562
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:21,590
If you think about it.

1563
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:22,330
Facts.

1564
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:22,570
Pretty much.

1565
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:23,970
That's how that works.

1566
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:24,790
Wait.

1567
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:27,870
Who's on the other team that we should be worried about?

1568
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:30,030
Um, almost all of them.

1569
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:30,590
Nobody.

1570
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:34,470
So who's their best player?

1571
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:38,630
Okay, good.

1572
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:41,670
Majority of them are one above all except for Lydia.

1573
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:42,510
Wait.

1574
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:48,950
It's okay.

1575
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:52,490
You have four one above all's, you have four one above all's, it's okay.

1576
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:54,830
Okay, we have four one above all's.

1577
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:55,490
They got what, five?

1578
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:59,550
Yeah, we have two rank ones, so yeah, better.

1579
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:07,010
So what does everybody here play?

1580
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:07,970
Like, what's y'all roles?

1581
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:09,490
Let's get to know the team a little bit, huh?

1582
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:11,990
Guru is tank.

1583
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:13,770
I'm DPS, pref.

1584
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:17,850
Play, like, Punisher, Hawkeye.

1585
00:58:19,310 --> 00:58:21,950
My, like, two mains, but I can really play anything, to be honest.

1586
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:23,450
Yeah, same.

1587
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:24,870
I don't mind flexing.

1588
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:26,610
Yo, let's start it up, shall we?

1589
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:29,030
Yeah, I heard Nekos is, like, the best support player.

1590
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:31,170
Yeah, yeah, I'm supposed to be playing support, yeah.

1591
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:32,110
But, I mean, I don't mind.

1592
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:34,230
If someone else wants to try Ultron, I'm down to, like, run something else.

1593
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:34,730
It's not a problem.

1594
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:37,730
Harry, no, no, you go crazy, bro.

1595
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:38,950
I saw your support, man.

1596
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:40,370
You made it all the way to the level.

1597
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:41,310
You proved them all wrong.

1598
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:42,610
Yeah, I proved myself.

1599
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:44,030
They said I couldn't do it.

1600
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:44,370
I did it.

1601
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:45,430
You did it, man.

1602
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:48,350
I watched your stream, because you're the only one that streamed at 8 a.m.

1603
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:53,270
Yeah, I mean, I'm from EU, so yeah, I'm up, like, kind of, like, right now.

1604
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:57,370
All right, Max Games are ready.

1605
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:02,450
I, like, remember when I'm...

1606
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:02,510
Okay, they're ready.

1607
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:03,110
All right, I'm sorry.

1608
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:06,210
When I'm muted and when I'm not, because that's awkward when I'm...

1609
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:06,910
Let's get it.

1610
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:06,910
Let's get it.

1611
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:07,190
Let's get it.

1612
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:08,730
You know, there's a lot on the line here, guys.

1613
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:09,670
Okay.

1614
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:11,630
100k tournament here.

1615
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:12,770
Oh, and new map.

1616
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:14,290
Yeah, new map, new map.

1617
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:16,550
I need to bring people up a little bit.

1618
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:17,910
Bring...

1619
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:20,370
Gale up a little bit.

1620
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:22,010
And Rage...

1621
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:22,630
That's my guy.

1622
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:23,130
...down.

1623
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:26,030
And then Gale a little up.

1624
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:27,690
I hope everything's better now.

1625
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:29,450
All right.

1626
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:30,110
You...

1627
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:30,450
Oh.

1628
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:31,850
Chip time!

1629
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:34,050
Stop laughing at me.

1630
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:34,850
Why are you guys laughing?

1631
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:36,910
Oh, you want me to do the storm thing, Doki?

1632
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:38,950
Or do you want to do the Hawkeye and...

1633
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:39,570
Oh.

1634
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:40,550
I'm down for whatever.

1635
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:41,150
Which one are you?

1636
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:42,350
If we got the team up.

1637
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:43,470
Let's...

1638
00:59:43,470 --> 00:59:43,950
Let's hit...

1639
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:44,590
Let's hit the team up.

1640
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:45,010
All right.

1641
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:47,650
Let's do the storm Jeff after.

1642
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:48,450
Oh, yeah.

1643
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:50,090
The shooting through walls?

1644
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:51,010
That's crazy.

1645
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:52,650
Yeah.

1646
00:59:52,910 --> 00:59:53,350
It's insane.

1647
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:58,030
Oh, my God.

1648
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:00,730
Oh.

1649
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:01,450
I can't take this.

1650
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:02,350
Let's see what the door look like.

1651
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:03,350
How do I get...

1652
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:04,050
Oh, is that the door?

1653
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:05,930
Actually didn't look at...

1654
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:06,910
Oh, the emote!

1655
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:09,770
That's cute.

1656
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:13,290
Right through...

1657
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:13,950
The G thing.

1658
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:16,230
But...

1659
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:17,250
I can't go to the portal.

1660
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:17,690
I can't go to the portal.

1661
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:19,450
Like the moon.

1662
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:20,070
I can't go to the portal.

1663
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:21,190
I figured it out.

1664
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:21,850
Oh, they have Penny.

1665
01:00:21,970 --> 01:00:22,190
They have Penny.

1666
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:22,910
I hear Penny setting up.

1667
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:24,190
Here comes.

1668
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:25,830
Okay.

1669
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:27,250
Lock in team.

1670
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:29,090
There's a Penny nest right outside of the door.

1671
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:30,630
There's a lot on the line here, guys.

1672
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:31,270
I'm scared.

1673
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:31,830
Lock in.

1674
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:32,530
I'm scared.

1675
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:33,850
Let's go!

1676
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:34,950
What is that?

1677
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:35,570
I thought I was in group.

1678
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:36,230
What the hell is that?

1679
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:37,190
What is that?

1680
01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:39,410
Oh, he's a part of the map, I think.

1681
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:40,670
Oh, he's the thing.

1682
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:41,210
He's the...

1683
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:41,870
Oh!

1684
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:42,990
That was you!

1685
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:44,390
Wait, he's won.

1686
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:44,950
Someone's won.

1687
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:46,130
I froze him?

1688
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:46,910
That is sick.

1689
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:48,490
Why is this guy on Venom?

1690
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:49,890
This guy's playing strong.

1691
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:50,390
Wow!

1692
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:51,410
He's try hiding.

1693
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:52,510
Yeah, real.

1694
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:53,610
Oh, wait.

1695
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:54,490
They're gonna do the Jeff...

1696
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:56,030
The Jeff Nato team up.

1697
01:00:56,710 --> 01:00:57,270
I could hit...

1698
01:00:57,270 --> 01:00:57,550
I could...

1699
01:00:57,550 --> 01:00:57,710
I could...

1700
01:00:57,710 --> 01:00:58,230
How do you reload?

1701
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:03,490
I froze Ultron.

1702
01:01:04,850 --> 01:01:05,470
Ultron won?

1703
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:06,390
GG.

1704
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:06,770
Oh!

1705
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:07,210
GG.

1706
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:07,750
No, I'm done.

1707
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:08,710
Alright.

1708
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:11,330
That was chip damage.

1709
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:13,470
Dunn's looking for dive.

1710
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:15,090
Alright, we're good.

1711
01:01:15,310 --> 01:01:15,650
Oh, he's low.

1712
01:01:15,870 --> 01:01:16,330
I'm safe.

1713
01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:16,770
Let us free low.

1714
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:17,250
Let us free low.

1715
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:22,010
If you're playing Venom, like...

1716
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:22,150
I don't know.

1717
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:23,130
I'm trying to play Wolverine.

1718
01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:23,530
He's tough.

1719
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:25,150
I mean, go for it.

1720
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:31,670
Oh, they have a penny thing here.

1721
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:34,070
Hey, keep putting wheels.

1722
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:35,330
I got it.

1723
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:37,070
Already locking the Wolverine.

1724
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:37,390
I love it.

1725
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:40,890
If he's playing Venom, like...

1726
01:01:40,890 --> 01:01:44,130
I mean, they're trying the new team up with Jeff, so I think he...

1727
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:44,530
Alright.

1728
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:45,810
5-0.

1729
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:46,530
He's got it.

1730
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:47,510
Alright.

1731
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:49,250
Not fighting pennies.

1732
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:49,910
Oh, he's nice.

1733
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:52,710
Hey, Ultron is crushing me right now.

1734
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:53,130
I got him.

1735
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:54,050
Nice, nice, nice.

1736
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:55,590
Where are they?

1737
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:57,250
Well played.

1738
01:01:57,470 --> 01:01:57,770
Well played.

1739
01:01:58,130 --> 01:01:59,170
This map is so confusing.

1740
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:01,170
It was their Ultron.

1741
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:02,190
Okay, bro.

1742
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:03,510
It's nice.

1743
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:04,070
I'm Ultron.

1744
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:05,030
I'm Ultron.

1745
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:06,130
I'm Ultron.

1746
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:06,870
I'm Ultron.

1747
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:08,050
Oh, our crew is so far up.

1748
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:08,670
One way on us.

1749
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:10,090
That's good.

1750
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:10,330
I got him.

1751
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:10,590
I got him.

1752
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:11,790
I'm Ultron as well.

1753
01:02:15,550 --> 01:02:16,950
Three, two, one.

1754
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:17,810
Rocket.

1755
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:19,570
Oh.

1756
01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:20,350
Oh, no.

1757
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:21,150
Yummy, yummy.

1758
01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:21,490
Oh, shit.

1759
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:24,490
Yummy, yummy.

1760
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:24,950
Oh, my God.

1761
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:26,130
We can't take you over.

1762
01:02:26,290 --> 01:02:26,970
To Jeffnado.

1763
01:02:27,790 --> 01:02:28,050
Oh, my God.

1764
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:28,650
We're helping.

1765
01:02:29,290 --> 01:02:29,810
I got him.

1766
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:31,270
We're up one, guys.

1767
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:31,530
Over.

1768
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:32,630
I'm about to die.

1769
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:33,930
Reloading?

1770
01:02:34,070 --> 01:02:34,750
Oh, the Ultron's lost.

1771
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:35,350
I got you, I got you.

1772
01:02:35,770 --> 01:02:36,530
Oh, thanks, guys.

1773
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:37,330
Appreciate it.

1774
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:38,790
I'm good.

1775
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:39,310
How you feeling, AJ?

1776
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:40,490
I'm good, I'm good.

1777
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:41,450
Hey, Penny go.

1778
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:42,550
Where did Penny go?

1779
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:44,890
Where did Penny go?

1780
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:45,750
Where did Penny go?

1781
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:46,070
It's okay.

1782
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:46,570
Yo!

1783
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:48,470
How the Penny just teleported?

1784
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:48,990
That's crazy.

1785
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:51,670
Yeah, he's teleported.

1786
01:02:51,770 --> 01:02:52,290
He's lagging.

1787
01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:52,710
He's lagging.

1788
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:53,370
Hit him, Rage!

1789
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:54,930
Come on.

1790
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:55,730
Nice.

1791
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,110
Thanks for the shield.

1792
01:02:57,290 --> 01:02:57,790
Oh, we did it.

1793
01:02:58,050 --> 01:02:58,390
First point.

1794
01:02:58,470 --> 01:02:59,530
I like that.

1795
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:00,430
I like that, bro.

1796
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:00,910
Nice captain.

1797
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:01,490
Let's go.

1798
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:01,970
Yeah!

1799
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:02,930
I like that out of you.

1800
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:04,350
Okay.

1801
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:08,190
I love this map.

1802
01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:09,230
That's right.

1803
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:09,470
That's right.

1804
01:03:09,570 --> 01:03:10,190
That's kind of cool.

1805
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:11,110
This map is actually pretty cool.

1806
01:03:13,930 --> 01:03:15,150
I like this map too.

1807
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:15,710
I'm pushing the cart right now.

1808
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:15,810
I'm pushing the cart right now.

1809
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:16,170
I'll turn down.

1810
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:18,410
So you have, like, Ultron heals.

1811
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:20,310
You got that objective.

1812
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:22,150
Alright, you got Ultron heals.

1813
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:23,450
There might not be a lot of heals.

1814
01:03:25,330 --> 01:03:25,490
Yeah.

1815
01:03:26,830 --> 01:03:27,990
I'm trying to keep you alive.

1816
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:30,590
I'm still just killin'.

1817
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:31,030
I'm still just killin'.

1818
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:32,150
I gotta miss.

1819
01:03:33,470 --> 01:03:33,950
Oh my god.

1820
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:35,010
Penny is right there, bro.

1821
01:03:35,330 --> 01:03:35,990
Kidnap this controller.

1822
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:37,490
Penny is still right in this corner.

1823
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:38,710
Penny's right in this corner.

1824
01:03:39,770 --> 01:03:40,750
What do we do about that?

1825
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:42,430
I don't know, bro.

1826
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:43,370
That's a good little spot.

1827
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:44,210
Still walk through the right.

1828
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:45,250
That's a good little spot, bro.

1829
01:03:45,710 --> 01:03:47,230
Can I get a couple of heals, pretty please?

1830
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:48,070
Bro, chat, what do you do?

1831
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:52,110
Oh yeah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, yeah.

1832
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:54,970
Where is he?

1833
01:03:55,330 --> 01:03:55,950
Oh, you might try to ult you.

1834
01:03:56,050 --> 01:03:56,890
Oh, I might be dead here.

1835
01:03:57,870 --> 01:03:59,330
I'm dead here.

1836
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:00,770
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, yeah.

1837
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:01,290
Thank you.

1838
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:03,670
Wait, he can't swing out.

1839
01:04:03,870 --> 01:04:04,590
Yeah, I'm trying, I'm trying.

1840
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:06,270
Nice, thank you.

1841
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:07,090
You keep everyone else alive.

1842
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:08,190
Yeah, yeah.

1843
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:11,610
Interesting map.

1844
01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:16,550
I have ult here.

1845
01:04:16,850 --> 01:04:18,170
And I'm low.

1846
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:18,870
Nice.

1847
01:04:19,170 --> 01:04:19,210
Nice.

1848
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:21,950
Oh, I froze someone in the back.

1849
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:23,290
Oh my God.

1850
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:24,210
Oh, shit.

1851
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:24,430
Alright.

1852
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:25,970
It's Yogi Yogi time.

1853
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:26,650
I had ult.

1854
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:27,570
He tried to steal the ult.

1855
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:30,050
Bro, he literally went right for me.

1856
01:04:30,550 --> 01:04:31,470
They're gonna eat you though.

1857
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:32,030
They're gonna eat you though.

1858
01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:32,610
Get you killed.

1859
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:34,010
You're gonna die in the ult.

1860
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:34,610
Do I get special?

1861
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:36,490
Yo, that's insane.

1862
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:37,030
I was alone.

1863
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:38,830
I can't do anything about it.

1864
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:40,930
It grabbed all of us.

1865
01:04:41,350 --> 01:04:41,930
Holy shit.

1866
01:04:42,430 --> 01:04:43,130
I'm trying to keep you alive.

1867
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:44,030
I can't.

1868
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:44,550
I'm trying.

1869
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:46,130
It actually grabbed all of us in it.

1870
01:04:46,210 --> 01:04:46,690
That's insane.

1871
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:48,090
I was alone.

1872
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:48,530
Bro.

1873
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:48,530
That's cool.

1874
01:04:49,530 --> 01:04:50,410
That's really powerful.

1875
01:04:52,570 --> 01:04:53,190
Oh, shoot.

1876
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:53,390
It's a storm.

1877
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:55,010
It's a storm.

1878
01:04:55,010 --> 01:04:55,010
Alright.

1879
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:56,470
It's actually moving.

1880
01:04:56,770 --> 01:04:57,090
Locky.

1881
01:04:58,210 --> 01:04:58,530
God.

1882
01:04:58,870 --> 01:04:59,470
Alright, push him down.

1883
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:01,750
You guys don't have a lot of heals.

1884
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:02,590
I'll try an ult.

1885
01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:04,230
Yeah, we're good.

1886
01:05:04,850 --> 01:05:05,470
Oh, yeah, we're good.

1887
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:05,650
Oh, yeah, we're good.

1888
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:06,230
Okay, we're good.

1889
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:06,790
Oh, hell.

1890
01:05:06,790 --> 01:05:08,250
Wait, there's two penny mines now?

1891
01:05:08,630 --> 01:05:08,990
Yeah, yeah.

1892
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:09,670
If you have a rocket.

1893
01:05:09,870 --> 01:05:10,470
You guys need to get down from there.

1894
01:05:10,530 --> 01:05:11,010
Get down from there.

1895
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:12,610
It's, uh, team up.

1896
01:05:12,850 --> 01:05:13,350
I got my ult now.

1897
01:05:14,270 --> 01:05:14,970
Uh, yeah.

1898
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:15,610
I'm coming over.

1899
01:05:20,790 --> 01:05:21,790
You got a lot of heals.

1900
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:22,370
You got a lot of heals.

1901
01:05:22,950 --> 01:05:24,090
You got a lot of heals.

1902
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:26,390
No way I get ult in here, huh?

1903
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:27,870
But have you built ultrots really fast, Necroz?

1904
01:05:28,070 --> 01:05:28,630
On ultrots?

1905
01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:30,470
Uh, it builds a pretty, yeah, pretty fast.

1906
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:32,030
Yeah, you guys are much faster than Luna.

1907
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:32,670
Nice.

1908
01:05:32,670 --> 01:05:33,110
I froze him.

1909
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:34,250
Got him.

1910
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:35,490
Oh my god, he just exploded.

1911
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:35,890
Nice.

1912
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:36,830
Yeah.

1913
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:37,670
You guys okay back there?

1914
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:38,810
Where are you guys going back there?

1915
01:05:38,970 --> 01:05:39,170
Don't run from me, boy.

1916
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:39,870
Don't run from me, boy.

1917
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:40,830
Why are you killing?

1918
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:43,490
I yoinked that final kill.

1919
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:43,750
Nice.

1920
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:44,850
So this is the next checkpoint.

1921
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:45,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1922
01:05:45,450 --> 01:05:45,790
What was that again?

1923
01:05:45,930 --> 01:05:46,010
What was that about?

1924
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:46,430
Wait, get the rocket.

1925
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:47,030
Get the rocket.

1926
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:47,050
Get the rocket.

1927
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:48,490
Get the rocket.

1928
01:05:49,550 --> 01:05:50,110
Where is she?

1929
01:05:50,850 --> 01:05:51,270
I got you.

1930
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:52,210
Oh, that's a naughty.

1931
01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:53,030
That's fine.

1932
01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:53,570
The spawn is right there.

1933
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:56,610
It's like... Oh, no, no, no.

1934
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:57,910
There's like two of the flies.

1935
01:05:57,910 --> 01:05:58,050
There's like two of the flies.

1936
01:05:58,130 --> 01:05:59,250
There's a lot of verticality.

1937
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:03,770
I'm back in the fight.

1938
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:04,870
How do I kill this?

1939
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:05,170
All that matters.

1940
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:10,670
Oh, hell no.

1941
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:12,090
I'm trying to get... Oh, goodbye.

1942
01:06:12,270 --> 01:06:12,470
Goodbye.

1943
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:13,290
I'm going to spawn.

1944
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:13,970
I'm going to spawn.

1945
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:14,050
I'm going to spawn.

1946
01:06:14,410 --> 01:06:14,730
Goodbye.

1947
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:16,970
Get back to spawn, back to spawn, back to spawn.

1948
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:17,890
Oh, he's on me.

1949
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:19,430
I'm safe.

1950
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:21,950
The hell is this chat?

1951
01:06:22,170 --> 01:06:25,290
I feel like Storm is exclusively focusing on me, bro.

1952
01:06:27,030 --> 01:06:28,090
He's your threat.

1953
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:29,110
You're too scary.

1954
01:06:29,410 --> 01:06:29,530
Yeah.

1955
01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:30,950
Yeah, I'm so scary.

1956
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:31,490
Oh, yeah.

1957
01:06:32,510 --> 01:06:33,510
You're doing too good.

1958
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:34,490
We gotta get you out.

1959
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:37,130
Oh, hell no.

1960
01:06:39,890 --> 01:06:40,810
Okay, I'm on, I'm on.

1961
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:41,850
I'm on.

1962
01:06:41,850 --> 01:06:42,390
I'm on.

1963
01:06:44,610 --> 01:06:45,250
I'm shooting Emma.

1964
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:47,630
I'm dead.

1965
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:49,310
I'm dead.

1966
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:51,830
I'm dead.

1967
01:06:53,030 --> 01:06:53,410
I'm dead.

1968
01:06:56,030 --> 01:06:56,750
Oh, shit.

1969
01:06:56,870 --> 01:06:58,110
What the fuck is he trying to do?

1970
01:06:58,270 --> 01:06:58,650
I think they messed up.

1971
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:01,590
Wait, we can kill Venom.

1972
01:07:01,710 --> 01:07:02,610
Oh, we got Venom.

1973
01:07:02,970 --> 01:07:04,670
We have Ultron ult after.

1974
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:06,010
How is he still alive?

1975
01:07:06,510 --> 01:07:08,190
Yeah, you build it really.

1976
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:09,130
Where is our spawn?

1977
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:10,490
Yeah, you get it like...

1978
01:07:10,490 --> 01:07:11,750
We hit this thing so much.

1979
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:12,790
Oh my god.

1980
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:14,490
Where's...

1981
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:19,550
That little ratat.

1982
01:07:19,810 --> 01:07:20,510
Finally, I hit it.

1983
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:21,910
Oh, shit.

1984
01:07:23,730 --> 01:07:25,430
I hear somebody right behind me.

1985
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:26,010
You just hit me.

1986
01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:26,530
What the fuck?

1987
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:29,990
Someone is among me right now.

1988
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:31,690
Hey, I'm ulting.

1989
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:32,830
Oh.

1990
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:33,190
Oh.

1991
01:07:35,870 --> 01:07:36,390
Oh, yeah.

1992
01:07:36,530 --> 01:07:37,390
Ulting back me there, bro.

1993
01:07:38,030 --> 01:07:38,110
I'm backing up.

1994
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:38,710
Very slowly.

1995
01:07:39,810 --> 01:07:40,130
Goodbye.

1996
01:07:40,830 --> 01:07:41,830
Oh, trying to heal you guys.

1997
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:42,410
Trying to heal you guys.

1998
01:07:42,650 --> 01:07:43,370
Well, I fought, man.

1999
01:07:43,410 --> 01:07:43,850
That's on me.

2000
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:46,050
We're good.

2001
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:46,270
We're good.

2002
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:47,450
Oh, I got you.

2003
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:49,750
Alright.

2004
01:07:49,910 --> 01:07:51,110
I'll give you Snowflake, girl.

2005
01:07:52,850 --> 01:07:53,250
Alright.

2006
01:07:54,910 --> 01:07:56,030
We almost got it, though.

2007
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:56,530
We're right there.

2008
01:07:56,870 --> 01:07:57,950
It's the last push.

2009
01:07:58,270 --> 01:07:58,610
Oh, shit.

2010
01:07:58,970 --> 01:07:59,310
I'm away.

2011
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:00,470
Oh!

2012
01:08:01,810 --> 01:08:02,070
They're doing it.

2013
01:08:02,110 --> 01:08:02,530
They're doing it.

2014
01:08:02,810 --> 01:08:03,670
Oh, no.

2015
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:05,890
Did you have low?

2016
01:08:06,790 --> 01:08:07,890
He ate only me.

2017
01:08:07,970 --> 01:08:08,370
Goodbye!

2018
01:08:09,110 --> 01:08:09,910
He ate me, too.

2019
01:08:10,110 --> 01:08:10,910
I made me dead.

2020
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:11,990
Oh, yeah.

2021
01:08:12,030 --> 01:08:12,210
We're good.

2022
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:13,530
The...

2023
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:14,410
...stores behind me.

2024
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:15,990
Yeah, you guys have low heals.

2025
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:16,970
They're shooting...

2026
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:17,410
Yeah.

2027
01:08:17,690 --> 01:08:17,930
I'm dead.

2028
01:08:18,190 --> 01:08:18,910
No, no, no, no.

2029
01:08:19,210 --> 01:08:19,450
I'm dead.

2030
01:08:20,790 --> 01:08:21,150
Storm1Hmae.

2031
01:08:21,190 --> 01:08:22,490
Oh, y'all getting cooked up.

2032
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:23,170
Oh, my God.

2033
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:24,150
I don't even know...

2034
01:08:24,150 --> 01:08:25,110
It's a bit tough.

2035
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:27,250
When Luna dies, you have really low heals.

2036
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:27,670
Yeah.

2037
01:08:28,050 --> 01:08:29,650
I think Ultron is like more like a...

2038
01:08:29,650 --> 01:08:30,790
Where the hell is Mag teleporting to?

2039
01:08:31,550 --> 01:08:31,870
I'm dead.

2040
01:08:33,490 --> 01:08:33,990
No, wait.

2041
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:34,570
Keep backing up.

2042
01:08:34,630 --> 01:08:35,130
Keep backing up.

2043
01:08:35,230 --> 01:08:35,730
You can live...

2044
01:08:35,730 --> 01:08:36,410
Oh, never mind.

2045
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:36,910
I lied.

2046
01:08:40,290 --> 01:08:41,090
Guys, two minutes.

2047
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:41,790
Lock it on in.

2048
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:43,290
We can try the Jeff Storm combo.

2049
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:44,910
True, true, true, true.

2050
01:08:44,910 --> 01:08:46,410
Look at B got to win this.

2051
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:47,730
I'm looking at him.

2052
01:08:48,530 --> 01:08:49,250
You got my ult?

2053
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:51,490
Ultron won.

2054
01:08:51,610 --> 01:08:52,110
I see it.

2055
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:56,110
Yeah, you can tell I'm rusty.

2056
01:08:56,730 --> 01:08:57,030
Oh, my God!

2057
01:08:57,290 --> 01:08:57,370
Oh!

2058
01:08:57,510 --> 01:08:58,210
I tried to save you!

2059
01:08:58,890 --> 01:08:59,310
That's a pack.

2060
01:09:00,690 --> 01:09:01,970
This is my shield Ultron!

2061
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:04,710
Oh my God, bro.

2062
01:09:04,990 --> 01:09:06,370
Jesus, I'm just gonna ult here.

2063
01:09:07,530 --> 01:09:08,650
Alright, we brawl.

2064
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:11,050
We're brawling.

2065
01:09:12,730 --> 01:09:13,610
Okay, I'm dead.

2066
01:09:13,610 --> 01:09:13,930
Ultron, ult!

2067
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:15,270
Oh, I'm alive.

2068
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:16,530
I leave.

2069
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:17,930
Uh-oh.

2070
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:19,990
I'm going through a lot of emotions.

2071
01:09:20,650 --> 01:09:21,050
Oh!

2072
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:22,210
Oh!

2073
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:24,410
Actually managed to keep you through it.

2074
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:25,370
I'm back it out.

2075
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:25,730
I'm back it out.

2076
01:09:25,730 --> 01:09:26,230
I'm alive, though.

2077
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:28,150
Yeah, you're on.

2078
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:30,290
Boger, why don't you be on the right?

2079
01:09:32,110 --> 01:09:32,810
You getting heals?

2080
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:34,290
You still half?

2081
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:36,190
Oh, no.

2082
01:09:38,290 --> 01:09:39,410
I'm not peeking them.

2083
01:09:39,530 --> 01:09:40,070
No, I'm fine.

2084
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:44,330
Got you.

2085
01:09:46,230 --> 01:09:47,050
They're pushing me here.

2086
01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:48,210
Yeah, they're pushing me, too.

2087
01:09:48,270 --> 01:09:48,770
I'm trying to keep your left.

2088
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:49,170
I'm dead.

2089
01:09:49,630 --> 01:09:49,970
Yeah, I can't.

2090
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:50,530
Yeah, they're chasing me.

2091
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:59,120
All right, we're going to need a storm for the jets.

2092
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:00,440
Oh, jets, argola.

2093
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:02,580
Do we even have time now?

2094
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:03,460
Yep.

2095
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:05,300
Boger's on the left.

2096
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:06,140
He's up to no good.

2097
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:08,280
Yeah, he's like playing that room.

2098
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:10,260
Enough side.

2099
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:11,660
All right.

2100
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:14,480
There's nobody in there.

2101
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:17,220
I hear... I hear someone behind me.

2102
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:17,680
Yeah, yeah.

2103
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:18,460
No, there is Nemo.

2104
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:19,820
I'm shielding you're fine, I think.

2105
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:22,560
I think he's on too, but my teammates are not fine.

2106
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:23,700
I've been so outplayed, bro.

2107
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:25,240
Wait, wait, Mike can die in there.

2108
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:26,700
I got you, I got you, I got you.

2109
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:28,360
He bubbled himself.

2110
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:29,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2111
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:29,740
He's one.

2112
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:30,760
I'm trying to escape you.

2113
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:33,160
He's one of me.

2114
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:34,480
Oh, they're doing the combo.

2115
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,440
They're doing the combo.

2116
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:37,040
I got it.

2117
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:39,720
Goodbye, everyone.

2118
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:42,080
Not so good.

2119
01:10:42,220 --> 01:10:42,960
Oh, my God.

2120
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:43,840
Not so good.

2121
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:45,720
Now, that combo is so OP.

2122
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:46,920
No, that's the Jeff Storm thing.

2123
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:47,560
Yeah.

2124
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:48,980
I can't really touch.

2125
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:49,540
No.

2126
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:51,620
Yeah, no, that is nuts.

2127
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:54,060
We got lucky.

2128
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:54,800
All good.

2129
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:55,620
Yeah, they went Jeff.

2130
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:57,280
They went, uh, Jeff Storm.

2131
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,300
They unfortunately just had Jeff Storm.

2132
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:04,620
Guys, why did we not ban...

2133
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:08,140
Yeah.

2134
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:08,900
Bad draft.

2135
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:10,940
Yeah, bad banline, guys.

2136
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:11,980
Bad banline.

2137
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,420
I'll swap sides so we, uh, defend now.

2138
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:19,100
Actually, can I?

2139
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,080
Oh, team swap, yeah.

2140
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:23,840
I think I can probably start again, right?

2141
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:27,400
Wait, so anyone know how long we're playing?

2142
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:28,840
Is it like one hour or, uh...

2143
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:29,880
Um, it's one hour.

2144
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,720
But then we can play longer if we want.

2145
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:33,360
Okay.

2146
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:33,740
Yes.

2147
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:34,980
All right.

2148
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:36,440
So does anyone want to try Ultron?

2149
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:37,920
I want to Jeff.

2150
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:39,020
I want to try Jeff.

2151
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:40,240
I can Ultron if you want.

2152
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:40,920
That's fun.

2153
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:43,180
I want to do Jeff.

2154
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:43,520
Off to you.

2155
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:49,530
And then...

2156
01:11:49,530 --> 01:11:50,310
Someone can go Storm.

2157
01:11:50,410 --> 01:11:51,210
Google can Storm, yeah?

2158
01:11:51,690 --> 01:11:52,330
Sure, sure, sure.

2159
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:52,730
I can do Storm.

2160
01:11:53,390 --> 01:11:54,050
You want to do Storm here?

2161
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:54,930
I think...

2162
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:55,470
Maybe you can do Tag.

2163
01:11:55,690 --> 01:11:55,730
No, no, no.

2164
01:11:56,030 --> 01:11:56,490
It's all you.

2165
01:11:57,330 --> 01:11:58,370
That's fun, though.

2166
01:11:59,530 --> 01:12:00,250
That is...

2167
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:00,890
That...

2168
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:01,170
The Jeff...

2169
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:02,370
The Jeffnado is scary.

2170
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:02,830
The...

2171
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:07,970
The Jeffnado is actually so scary.

2172
01:12:08,410 --> 01:12:08,590
Guys.

2173
01:12:11,050 --> 01:12:12,950
It was like...

2174
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:13,970
Flyer comp.

2175
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:15,510
It was literally like...

2176
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:17,570
They literally win because of the Jeffnado.

2177
01:12:19,570 --> 01:12:21,010
Oh, we're trying to Storm, Jeff?

2178
01:12:21,330 --> 01:12:22,150
Ultron either.

2179
01:12:22,150 --> 01:12:22,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2180
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:22,930
It's our turn.

2181
01:12:23,890 --> 01:12:24,790
Fire, fire, fire.

2182
01:12:26,590 --> 01:12:27,070
Yeah.

2183
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:30,490
I think I have like less than an hour play time on Jeff.

2184
01:12:31,990 --> 01:12:32,610
Oh, okay.

2185
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:33,270
I mean...

2186
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:33,670
Hey, man.

2187
01:12:34,150 --> 01:12:35,070
Just do your best, you know?

2188
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:36,190
It's okay.

2189
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:36,910
I got this.

2190
01:12:37,690 --> 01:12:38,730
How hard can it be?

2191
01:12:40,210 --> 01:12:40,890
Can't be that hard.

2192
01:12:42,230 --> 01:12:42,570
Three...

2193
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:42,710
Two...

2194
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:44,310
One...

2195
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:44,510
Oh.

2196
01:12:45,010 --> 01:12:45,410
Just here.

2197
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:46,290
Like down here, I think.

2198
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:46,990
Under this bridge.

2199
01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:48,850
Oh, my God.

2200
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:49,670
Oh, my God.

2201
01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:50,530
Where am I getting hit from?

2202
01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:51,790
I'm behind a little bit, guys.

2203
01:12:52,270 --> 01:12:52,930
Late to work.

2204
01:12:53,830 --> 01:12:55,110
I don't know where I'm getting hit from.

2205
01:12:56,290 --> 01:12:57,190
Where's my Groot?

2206
01:12:57,370 --> 01:12:57,770
New map.

2207
01:12:57,770 --> 01:12:57,830
Yeah.

2208
01:12:58,510 --> 01:12:59,070
Oh, yeah.

2209
01:12:59,110 --> 01:12:59,570
The Groot's here.

2210
01:12:59,690 --> 01:13:00,090
The Groot's here.

2211
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:02,390
Holy shit.

2212
01:13:02,430 --> 01:13:03,610
There's someone to the top.

2213
01:13:04,010 --> 01:13:04,410
Above us.

2214
01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:06,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2215
01:13:06,650 --> 01:13:07,090
Punisher 1.

2216
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:07,610
Nice.

2217
01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:08,850
Oh, God.

2218
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:10,510
Jesus.

2219
01:13:10,990 --> 01:13:11,330
Didn't I?

2220
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:14,870
Holy smokes.

2221
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:16,130
All the flying characters.

2222
01:13:17,150 --> 01:13:17,990
Yeah, they got a lot of fire.

2223
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:18,710
Yeah.

2224
01:13:20,510 --> 01:13:22,130
Oh, I can't Q2 up.

2225
01:13:23,170 --> 01:13:24,730
Oh, my God.

2226
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:25,890
That's why he does.

2227
01:13:26,690 --> 01:13:27,490
That's why I'm not coming from.

2228
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:29,110
You're taking so much damage.

2229
01:13:30,290 --> 01:13:31,150
Oh, my God.

2230
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:31,650
Wait.

2231
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:32,990
I'm just healing.

2232
01:13:33,690 --> 01:13:34,130
Oh, my God.

2233
01:13:34,430 --> 01:13:34,730
I just...

2234
01:13:35,470 --> 01:13:36,270
What is that?

2235
01:13:36,470 --> 01:13:37,090
What is that?

2236
01:13:37,090 --> 01:13:38,110
I can't stop healing.

2237
01:13:38,410 --> 01:13:39,650
They got a lot of memes.

2238
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:40,850
A lot of memes.

2239
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:41,890
What do we do?

2240
01:13:44,230 --> 01:13:44,970
Wait, wait, wait.

2241
01:13:45,070 --> 01:13:46,070
What do we do?

2242
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:46,790
Nah, nah, nah.

2243
01:13:47,610 --> 01:13:48,430
Yo, wait, wait.

2244
01:13:48,570 --> 01:13:49,110
We just triggered.

2245
01:13:49,310 --> 01:13:49,630
We just triggered.

2246
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:50,270
Alright.

2247
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:52,990
Can we just not, like, give a little more?

2248
01:13:54,850 --> 01:13:56,090
I can touch, maybe?

2249
01:13:56,350 --> 01:13:56,950
I'm on?

2250
01:13:59,290 --> 01:14:00,850
I can't even DPS.

2251
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:01,830
I'm just kidding.

2252
01:14:06,130 --> 01:14:07,050
Jesus Christ.

2253
01:14:09,650 --> 01:14:10,570
Goodbye, everybody.

2254
01:14:11,930 --> 01:14:12,430
I'm trying.

2255
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:13,350
We are just getting melted.

2256
01:14:15,690 --> 01:14:17,350
Guys, Team B needs a victory here.

2257
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:19,670
We can't be letting this happen.

2258
01:14:20,270 --> 01:14:22,090
I'm a lost in this map.

2259
01:14:22,190 --> 01:14:23,070
I don't know where...

2260
01:14:23,070 --> 01:14:24,810
I don't know where I'm going, either.

2261
01:14:26,110 --> 01:14:28,010
There's so many halls and corridors.

2262
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:30,150
Yeah, I'm a little lost.

2263
01:14:30,450 --> 01:14:31,290
They're amazing.

2264
01:14:31,910 --> 01:14:32,290
Okay.

2265
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:35,890
Alright, Nekros, you have your all, Nekros.

2266
01:14:37,070 --> 01:14:38,290
I got your drone, Nekros.

2267
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:45,470
Oh, he just knew, he knew, he knew, he knew.

2268
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:48,170
Where the fuck did he just...

2269
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:48,730
Sorry, guys.

2270
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:50,930
I don't know where I am.

2271
01:14:51,770 --> 01:14:53,110
I don't know where I am.

2272
01:14:53,130 --> 01:14:53,210
I don't know where I am, either.

2273
01:14:53,470 --> 01:14:53,730
Oh my gosh.

2274
01:14:54,450 --> 01:14:54,610
I think.

2275
01:14:55,210 --> 01:14:55,810
I got my ult.

2276
01:14:55,890 --> 01:14:56,310
Do you want a combo?

2277
01:14:56,970 --> 01:14:57,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2278
01:14:58,650 --> 01:14:59,830
I'm respawning, I'm respawning.

2279
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:01,710
I do an ult on the ult.

2280
01:15:02,350 --> 01:15:02,850
This is a tough.

2281
01:15:02,850 --> 01:15:03,590
I'm just cooked, I'm just cooked.

2282
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:04,490
I don't know.

2283
01:15:04,610 --> 01:15:04,870
Nightline.

2284
01:15:05,310 --> 01:15:06,170
Just go ahead, just throw it through.

2285
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:06,870
Send it, send it, send it.

2286
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:08,910
I need a five from where they are.

2287
01:15:09,210 --> 01:15:09,630
There you are.

2288
01:15:10,610 --> 01:15:11,190
Oh, we're running.

2289
01:15:12,450 --> 01:15:13,230
I think we're cooked.

2290
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:14,170
What?

2291
01:15:14,970 --> 01:15:15,450
What?

2292
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:17,390
Oh my god, he ulted me there.

2293
01:15:18,730 --> 01:15:21,310
He just destroyed me with Punisher ult.

2294
01:15:22,070 --> 01:15:22,550
Nooo.

2295
01:15:24,090 --> 01:15:25,190
I couldn't get picked up.

2296
01:15:25,430 --> 01:15:26,390
I'm so sad.

2297
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:28,350
I couldn't get picked up.

2298
01:15:28,350 --> 01:15:29,650
Yeah, they just popped the Punisher ult.

2299
01:15:30,570 --> 01:15:31,690
Yeah, we got locked in here, bro.

2300
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:32,130
That's what's happening.

2301
01:15:32,230 --> 01:15:32,930
This map is...

2302
01:15:32,930 --> 01:15:33,770
I'm all of you on this, nigga.

2303
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:34,110
What's up?

2304
01:15:34,210 --> 01:15:35,410
I think we're just trying to figure out like...

2305
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:35,870
Run me the ones.

2306
01:15:36,050 --> 01:15:36,450
Run the ones.

2307
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:36,870
What's up?

2308
01:15:37,810 --> 01:15:39,290
We don't know where we are.

2309
01:15:39,690 --> 01:15:40,870
I'm so confused.

2310
01:15:41,490 --> 01:15:41,570
Yeah.

2311
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:42,290
He's not just sold.

2312
01:15:42,670 --> 01:15:44,290
Oh my god, bro.

2313
01:15:45,490 --> 01:15:46,590
Shroud, just do it, bro.

2314
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:53,110
I think I just need to be picked up by you.

2315
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:55,250
Get this, Shroud, just...

2316
01:15:56,970 --> 01:15:57,710
You get over there?

2317
01:15:58,810 --> 01:15:59,170
Agent?

2318
01:16:00,110 --> 01:16:01,550
Me and Shroud are kicking right now.

2319
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:03,490
Wait, where is everybody?

2320
01:16:04,050 --> 01:16:05,550
There's only four of us.

2321
01:16:06,190 --> 01:16:06,950
Where's the other two?

2322
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:09,310
Yo, Agent.

2323
01:16:10,030 --> 01:16:10,130
Yeah.

2324
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:11,630
What's the status over there, bro?

2325
01:16:11,930 --> 01:16:12,190
Where's...

2326
01:16:12,190 --> 01:16:12,570
Where's the...

2327
01:16:13,370 --> 01:16:14,930
Aw, they're doing a streamer thing.

2328
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:16,350
Nah, they're doing weird stuff.

2329
01:16:16,670 --> 01:16:17,410
They're doing a streamer thing.

2330
01:16:17,450 --> 01:16:17,810
What are they doing?

2331
01:16:18,050 --> 01:16:18,450
What's happening?

2332
01:16:18,730 --> 01:16:19,110
What are they doing?

2333
01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:20,510
They missed, they missed, they missed.

2334
01:16:20,510 --> 01:16:20,530
They missed.

2335
01:16:20,530 --> 01:16:21,050
They missed.

2336
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:23,390
I got my first kill.

2337
01:16:23,530 --> 01:16:23,710
Let's go.

2338
01:16:24,650 --> 01:16:25,010
One of minutes.

2339
01:16:26,410 --> 01:16:27,550
Oh my god, guys, we did it.

2340
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:28,410
We won our first team fight.

2341
01:16:28,510 --> 01:16:29,270
I'm proud of y'all.

2342
01:16:29,490 --> 01:16:29,970
Love you.

2343
01:16:30,270 --> 01:16:30,850
Wait, I made one.

2344
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:32,810
Wait, I made one.

2345
01:16:32,930 --> 01:16:33,290
Wait, I made one.

2346
01:16:33,290 --> 01:16:33,830
Behind us, behind us.

2347
01:16:33,870 --> 01:16:34,610
There's a furniture behind.

2348
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:35,710
Yeah, the spawn is right there.

2349
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:37,910
Oh, what the heck?

2350
01:16:38,050 --> 01:16:38,210
Okay.

2351
01:16:38,790 --> 01:16:39,010
Oh.

2352
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:41,290
Yeah, we're in their spawn, guys.

2353
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:44,170
Cap can die.

2354
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:45,110
Yeah.

2355
01:16:45,710 --> 01:16:46,030
Owned.

2356
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:46,730
Oh, no.

2357
01:16:47,190 --> 01:16:47,950
Oh, no.

2358
01:16:48,190 --> 01:16:48,950
I might be dead.

2359
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:50,750
They spawn here.

2360
01:16:50,970 --> 01:16:51,010
I'm good.

2361
01:16:51,130 --> 01:16:51,270
I'm good.

2362
01:16:51,370 --> 01:16:51,530
Yeah.

2363
01:16:51,730 --> 01:16:52,470
I don't know where they spawn right now.

2364
01:16:52,670 --> 01:16:53,790
Oh, these lasers!

2365
01:16:56,210 --> 01:16:57,190
A lot of lasers.

2366
01:16:58,630 --> 01:16:59,010
I'm good.

2367
01:16:59,130 --> 01:16:59,250
I'm good.

2368
01:16:59,330 --> 01:16:59,590
I'm good.

2369
01:16:59,770 --> 01:17:01,330
Yeah, I just got the combo.

2370
01:17:01,670 --> 01:17:01,710
Alright.

2371
01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:04,050
I'm a rat.

2372
01:17:04,930 --> 01:17:05,750
I'm gonna spawn, GG.

2373
01:17:06,550 --> 01:17:07,370
Oh, I don't have heal.

2374
01:17:07,450 --> 01:17:08,270
I have to heal those.

2375
01:17:08,650 --> 01:17:08,970
Nice.

2376
01:17:09,070 --> 01:17:09,490
Go ahead, go ahead.

2377
01:17:09,570 --> 01:17:10,990
Wait, there's a Punisher behind us.

2378
01:17:11,650 --> 01:17:12,270
No, no, no, no, no.

2379
01:17:12,370 --> 01:17:13,490
I don't see the Punisher.

2380
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:16,210
He's at the height.

2381
01:17:17,390 --> 01:17:17,830
Any heals?

2382
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:18,250
Any heals?

2383
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:18,290
Any heals?

2384
01:17:19,410 --> 01:17:19,710
Bro.

2385
01:17:19,790 --> 01:17:20,850
I'm coming back now.

2386
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:21,210
Yeah.

2387
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:22,850
Oh, goodbye, Aegid.

2388
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:23,270
Goodbye.

2389
01:17:24,490 --> 01:17:24,810
Bro.

2390
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:26,010
I didn't know that could happen.

2391
01:17:27,230 --> 01:17:28,250
I didn't know that could happen.

2392
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:28,790
There's a cliff on this map.

2393
01:17:28,790 --> 01:17:28,830
There's a cliff on this map?

2394
01:17:29,110 --> 01:17:30,050
Oh, Jesus Christ.

2395
01:17:30,530 --> 01:17:31,630
Oh, there's all these lasers.

2396
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:32,570
There's so many lasers.

2397
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:33,530
Oh, where am I?

2398
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:34,150
Oh, my God.

2399
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:34,890
There you go.

2400
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:35,570
I got you again.

2401
01:17:36,430 --> 01:17:37,410
Agent, how you feeling, Agent?

2402
01:17:38,110 --> 01:17:39,410
Better not I'm on Hulk, man.

2403
01:17:39,490 --> 01:17:39,910
I'm not gonna lie.

2404
01:17:39,990 --> 01:17:40,690
Oh, I have to reload.

2405
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:42,950
All good.

2406
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:43,390
All good.

2407
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:44,390
I set my ult here.

2408
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:45,670
Watch that Iron Man ult.

2409
01:17:46,110 --> 01:17:46,450
You fucker.

2410
01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:47,810
Oh, yeah.

2411
01:17:48,710 --> 01:17:49,430
That's Iron Man ult.

2412
01:17:50,450 --> 01:17:51,250
That's Iron Man ult.

2413
01:17:52,510 --> 01:17:53,410
What does this do?

2414
01:17:53,490 --> 01:17:54,030
What does this take me?

2415
01:17:54,030 --> 01:17:56,070
Alright, let's do the combo this time for sure.

2416
01:17:56,710 --> 01:17:58,050
Alright, we have like the sixth ult.

2417
01:17:58,250 --> 01:17:59,170
Let's just use everything.

2418
01:18:02,790 --> 01:18:03,230
Knead.

2419
01:18:06,430 --> 01:18:07,710
Oh my God.

2420
01:18:07,770 --> 01:18:08,270
Oh, my God.

2421
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:09,950
Tick me up, pick me up, pick me up, pick me up.

2422
01:18:09,970 --> 01:18:10,590
Oh, no.

2423
01:18:11,690 --> 01:18:11,910
He's here.

2424
01:18:11,910 --> 01:18:11,930
Oh!

2425
01:18:11,930 --> 01:18:12,230
Thank you.

2426
01:18:12,510 --> 01:18:13,210
Thank you.

2427
01:18:13,870 --> 01:18:14,490
Heavy pan.

2428
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:14,550
He's on.

2429
01:18:15,350 --> 01:18:17,710
He's Débuked, he's on.

2430
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:18,790
Oh, no.

2431
01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:19,110
We're dead.

2432
01:18:19,450 --> 01:18:19,670
We're dead.

2433
01:18:19,930 --> 01:18:20,510
So many lasers.

2434
01:18:21,450 --> 01:18:21,930
It's okay.

2435
01:18:22,090 --> 01:18:23,090
He's so, don't kill him.

2436
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:26,190
PattonATTıyorumix.

2437
01:18:26,210 --> 01:18:27,170
He's so low.

2438
01:18:28,050 --> 01:18:28,850
I got you.

2439
01:18:29,050 --> 01:18:29,150
He's go too low.

2440
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:31,630
Oh, Usain with the heals!

2441
01:18:32,050 --> 01:18:33,390
I got you over there.

2442
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:39,130
Hit him.

2443
01:18:39,530 --> 01:18:40,530
Did you get him?

2444
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:43,650
Oh, he's one!

2445
01:18:43,770 --> 01:18:44,090
I got him!

2446
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:48,650
Wait, there's someone behind us.

2447
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:49,370
I think it's the Punisher.

2448
01:18:49,490 --> 01:18:50,530
Oh, no, it's Captain America.

2449
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:51,350
Cap, Cap, Cap.

2450
01:18:51,510 --> 01:18:52,230
Cap one, Cap one.

2451
01:18:54,850 --> 01:18:55,830
Where are you spawning?

2452
01:18:57,110 --> 01:18:58,070
Like, here.

2453
01:19:00,370 --> 01:19:02,070
Oh, I went to their spawn.

2454
01:19:05,590 --> 01:19:07,430
Portal, portal, portal, portal, portal.

2455
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:09,470
Oh, he might do a streamer clip again.

2456
01:19:12,510 --> 01:19:14,110
He's gonna set up an Iron Man ult.

2457
01:19:16,950 --> 01:19:17,470
Or something.

2458
01:19:17,870 --> 01:19:18,510
They're doing something.

2459
01:19:19,510 --> 01:19:19,990
They're thinking.

2460
01:19:20,290 --> 01:19:20,350
They're thinking.

2461
01:19:20,350 --> 01:19:21,070
What are they doing back here?

2462
01:19:21,730 --> 01:19:22,450
There it is!

2463
01:19:22,570 --> 01:19:22,810
There it is!

2464
01:19:22,810 --> 01:19:24,370
I do it!

2465
01:19:24,450 --> 01:19:25,550
Wait, do it!

2466
01:19:25,710 --> 01:19:26,770
They didn't show on my screen!

2467
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:27,670
I do it!

2468
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:27,850
They popped out.

2469
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:28,930
They're over here.

2470
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:30,470
They do it!

2471
01:19:31,510 --> 01:19:32,790
Oh, the fuck is on me!

2472
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:33,590
I got you!

2473
01:19:33,730 --> 01:19:34,110
I got you!

2474
01:19:34,230 --> 01:19:34,790
Oh, thank you!

2475
01:19:35,410 --> 01:19:36,670
Oh, he caught everyone!

2476
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:36,990
Oh, he caught everyone!

2477
01:19:37,490 --> 01:19:37,890
Oh,

2478
01:19:41,950 --> 01:19:42,550
he's so low!

2479
01:19:42,910 --> 01:19:43,270
Oh, he's so low!

2480
01:19:43,950 --> 01:19:44,350
Please!

2481
01:19:45,010 --> 01:19:45,690
It's so crazy!

2482
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:47,010
I don't know where anything is!

2483
01:19:50,010 --> 01:19:51,090
I have ult here.

2484
01:19:51,330 --> 01:19:51,490
Okay.

2485
01:19:51,850 --> 01:19:52,390
Make it happen.

2486
01:19:53,030 --> 01:19:54,190
Whoever this strange is, I hate him.

2487
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:56,890
Yo, all these lasers, bro!

2488
01:19:57,270 --> 01:19:57,850
I tried, bro.

2489
01:19:58,050 --> 01:19:59,010
Get the freak away from me, bro!

2490
01:19:59,010 --> 01:19:59,990
Oh, I couldn't!

2491
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:00,910
I'm celebrating the fuck out.

2492
01:20:01,090 --> 01:20:01,170
I'm dead.

2493
01:20:01,670 --> 01:20:02,210
Oh, far.

2494
01:20:02,410 --> 01:20:03,130
We almost had the combo.

2495
01:20:03,790 --> 01:20:05,010
Wait, can we hit the point?

2496
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:05,370
Oh!

2497
01:20:05,830 --> 01:20:05,990
No!

2498
01:20:06,570 --> 01:20:07,870
So, I forgot about that.

2499
01:20:09,630 --> 01:20:10,610
You forgot about that.

2500
01:20:10,990 --> 01:20:11,270
Damn it.

2501
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,060
I think we're just very last.

2502
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:19,800
We had.

2503
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:23,800
Let's diagnose what went wrong there, guys.

2504
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:26,280
Um...

2505
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:26,820
Oh, we lost.

2506
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:30,240
Wait, the first two points, we had no idea where we were.

2507
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:31,560
We were, like...

2508
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:32,400
Half of us were split up.

2509
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:32,960
Yeah, we were, like, staggering.

2510
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:35,100
We're slurring the map.

2511
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:37,640
I'm at the punny here.

2512
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:38,760
Hold on.

2513
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:40,060
I'm gonna try, let's try.

2514
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:47,680
What are my thoughts on Jeff?

2515
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:51,840
I think, like, our team wasn't coordinated to utilize Jeff there.

2516
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:55,420
Jeff worked well for the other team, only because, like, they were...

2517
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:56,940
more coordinated than us.

2518
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:58,340
Because they were all bunched up, boy.

2519
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:59,860
We were very split up.

2520
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:01,840
I was like, wait, there's four of us.

2521
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:02,660
We're...

2522
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:05,600
Like, at one point in the fight, I was like...

2523
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,380
If it's this hard, then everybody's got way better.

2524
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:08,120
Wait, there's four of us.

2525
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:09,740
Where's the other two players?

2526
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:11,600
Like...

2527
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,100
On age's life, we win this one.

2528
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:13,940
We have a tournament.

2529
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:14,480
We have a tournament.

2530
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:15,940
Hell no, man.

2531
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:18,720
Y'all are sweaty.

2532
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:19,260
Y'all are sweaty.

2533
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:20,200
It's not gonna be that hard.

2534
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:20,780
It's not gonna be this hard.

2535
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:21,280
Oh, hell no.

2536
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:25,240
I don't even know what color that rank is.

2537
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:27,380
Is it red?

2538
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:28,340
I'm trying to adjust...

2539
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:30,200
my volume...

2540
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:30,640
real quick.

2541
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:31,140
Oh, yeah.

2542
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:31,460
It's red.

2543
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,960
By the way, Black Widow has the Teemo for the Punisher.

2544
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:36,720
It's pretty crazy.

2545
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:41,020
You want one of us to play Black Widow?

2546
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:42,000
490 gold.

2547
01:21:42,260 --> 01:21:43,120
It's up to you guys.

2548
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:44,820
I don't really play it.

2549
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:46,480
You do not want me on Widow, I think.

2550
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:50,160
Just exist as a person.

2551
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:52,780
Alright.

2552
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:59,060
We're locking in this game.

2553
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:00,180
We're locking in this game.

2554
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:01,200
I didn't remember like...

2555
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:03,020
Oh, I'm just dead already.

2556
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:04,800
I didn't remember like...

2557
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,520
my left click is not healed.

2558
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:06,840
Got one.

2559
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:08,580
Got two that fast.

2560
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:09,080
That's crazy.

2561
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,180
Oh, he's Thor.

2562
01:22:11,180 --> 01:22:12,400
Oh no, you're about to get ditched, boy.

2563
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:13,680
You're about to get ditched, boy.

2564
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:14,240
You're about to get ditched, boy.

2565
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:16,860
Oh, I don't think we have enough healing with Mantis Ultron though.

2566
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:18,600
Because Ultron doesn't heal that much.

2567
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:19,600
Yeah.

2568
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,120
Ultron's heal is like really weak.

2569
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:23,720
I'm not gonna lie.

2570
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:26,240
Right there, it felt like the Ultron heals made the difference, man.

2571
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:26,800
I can do it.

2572
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:27,360
I can do Loki.

2573
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:28,280
I can do Loki.

2574
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:29,000
It's alright.

2575
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:29,120
Alright.

2576
01:22:29,180 --> 01:22:30,440
Oh, you're doing...

2577
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:31,820
Uh...

2578
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:32,520
Okay, okay.

2579
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:33,460
Okay.

2580
01:22:35,380 --> 01:22:37,000
All I can do is just press E.

2581
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:39,000
And occasionally right click.

2582
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:41,020
What did he just do to damage me that much?

2583
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:46,100
Oh my god.

2584
01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:47,900
He actually shits my...

2585
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:48,940
My bots.

2586
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:53,740
Sentral's so weird.

2587
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:55,020
Eh.

2588
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:58,980
Wait, who's over there?

2589
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:00,180
Oh, I'm gonna need health.

2590
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:01,100
Rage is in there.

2591
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:01,680
It's Boger.

2592
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:02,020
Oh.

2593
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:03,060
Boger's Rage Bating.

2594
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:03,640
He's Rage Bating.

2595
01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:14,830
I'm cooked.

2596
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:15,190
I'm cooked.

2597
01:23:15,310 --> 01:23:15,510
I'm cooked.

2598
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:15,830
I'm cooked.

2599
01:23:15,970 --> 01:23:16,650
That was such a bad decision.

2600
01:23:16,650 --> 01:23:16,990
I got you.

2601
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:18,650
I got healing.

2602
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:20,010
Goodbye.

2603
01:23:24,030 --> 01:23:24,390
Well...

2604
01:23:24,390 --> 01:23:24,590
I'm back.

2605
01:23:24,610 --> 01:23:24,890
Bye, love.

2606
01:23:25,090 --> 01:23:26,250
Thank you so much for the save.

2607
01:23:26,770 --> 01:23:27,110
Come back.

2608
01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:29,290
Yeah, right.

2609
01:23:29,430 --> 01:23:30,870
Ultron is so fast.

2610
01:23:31,210 --> 01:23:31,570
So Ultron.

2611
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:34,170
Oh, there.

2612
01:23:34,170 --> 01:23:34,330
We're...

2613
01:23:34,330 --> 01:23:35,170
We're running.

2614
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:35,430
Not bad.

2615
01:23:36,950 --> 01:23:37,770
Oh, no.

2616
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:40,850
Nice!

2617
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:42,850
Thank you.

2618
01:23:43,110 --> 01:23:43,710
Thank you.

2619
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:44,170
Thank you.

2620
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:44,810
My hero.

2621
01:23:45,670 --> 01:23:46,990
There's a door over too, right?

2622
01:23:50,310 --> 01:23:51,250
Kill Boger.

2623
01:23:51,450 --> 01:23:51,910
Kill Boger.

2624
01:23:52,350 --> 01:23:53,150
He's won.

2625
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:56,290
Oh, he's dead.

2626
01:23:56,410 --> 01:23:56,990
Go right, team.

2627
01:23:57,730 --> 01:23:58,030
Alright.

2628
01:23:59,990 --> 01:24:00,790
We're doing it.

2629
01:24:01,430 --> 01:24:03,690
Wait, Rocket is...

2630
01:24:03,690 --> 01:24:04,710
Rocket's here or left?

2631
01:24:05,470 --> 01:24:06,610
Yeah, they're healing the door.

2632
01:24:08,130 --> 01:24:08,530
Extaration!

2633
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:10,230
Backing up a little.

2634
01:24:10,430 --> 01:24:10,610
Back off.

2635
01:24:13,530 --> 01:24:13,930
It's...

2636
01:24:13,930 --> 01:24:14,530
Fighter time!

2637
01:24:15,730 --> 01:24:16,450
Okay, nice.

2638
01:24:16,490 --> 01:24:16,850
Alright.

2639
01:24:17,790 --> 01:24:18,730
Let's slow it down.

2640
01:24:20,070 --> 01:24:20,350
Kill Boger.

2641
01:24:20,570 --> 01:24:21,070
Kill Boger.

2642
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:21,670
Kill Boger.

2643
01:24:22,010 --> 01:24:22,350
Kill Boger.

2644
01:24:22,350 --> 01:24:23,550
Kill Boger.

2645
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:24,070
Kill Boger.

2646
01:24:24,070 --> 01:24:24,330
Oh, no.

2647
01:24:24,730 --> 01:24:25,350
Oh, my God.

2648
01:24:25,910 --> 01:24:26,510
Yeah, I got res.

2649
01:24:26,610 --> 01:24:26,770
I got res.

2650
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:27,090
Nice.

2651
01:24:27,090 --> 01:24:28,490
Bro, Penny is powerful.

2652
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:29,770
Oh, my...

2653
01:24:31,130 --> 01:24:31,790
Get the...

2654
01:24:31,790 --> 01:24:32,570
The team up.

2655
01:24:36,510 --> 01:24:37,090
Nice.

2656
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:38,950
I got cap.

2657
01:24:39,490 --> 01:24:40,290
I got C9.

2658
01:24:40,590 --> 01:24:41,010
Yikes.

2659
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:41,850
I would never do that.

2660
01:24:41,850 --> 01:24:41,990
Thor half?

2661
01:24:42,190 --> 01:24:42,510
Thor low.

2662
01:24:42,650 --> 01:24:42,930
Thor low.

2663
01:24:43,330 --> 01:24:43,850
Nice.

2664
01:24:43,850 --> 01:24:44,290
Stop.

2665
01:24:44,590 --> 01:24:45,110
Nice.

2666
01:24:45,710 --> 01:24:46,310
Alright.

2667
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:52,690
Oh, my God.

2668
01:24:52,890 --> 01:24:54,770
I'm so not used to flying in a diamond shape.

2669
01:25:00,770 --> 01:25:01,970
So disorienting.

2670
01:25:03,510 --> 01:25:04,630
Ogre is behind.

2671
01:25:05,150 --> 01:25:05,490
Again?

2672
01:25:06,130 --> 01:25:06,870
He's trolling.

2673
01:25:07,030 --> 01:25:07,390
He's rage meeting.

2674
01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:08,650
I'm gonna chase him.

2675
01:25:09,130 --> 01:25:09,930
I'm gonna chase him.

2676
01:25:10,090 --> 01:25:10,170
Okay.

2677
01:25:10,590 --> 01:25:11,150
I'll follow you.

2678
01:25:11,410 --> 01:25:12,370
I'll pocket you.

2679
01:25:15,010 --> 01:25:15,890
Okay, don't die.

2680
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:17,250
I'm fine.

2681
01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:17,550
I'm fine.

2682
01:25:17,690 --> 01:25:18,470
I'm hearing noises.

2683
01:25:18,630 --> 01:25:19,050
I don't know where.

2684
01:25:19,470 --> 01:25:20,410
You're halfway there.

2685
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:21,110
You're ready for combo.

2686
01:25:21,930 --> 01:25:22,410
He's low.

2687
01:25:22,690 --> 01:25:23,070
Oh, wait.

2688
01:25:23,390 --> 01:25:24,450
The Ultron is also here.

2689
01:25:24,690 --> 01:25:24,950
I'm ready.

2690
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:26,370
I'm gonna have this.

2691
01:25:26,690 --> 01:25:26,990
No.

2692
01:25:27,210 --> 01:25:27,390
No.

2693
01:25:28,470 --> 01:25:31,310
That was my bad.

2694
01:25:31,310 --> 01:25:32,090
That was my bad.

2695
01:25:32,410 --> 01:25:33,050
I'm just dead.

2696
01:25:33,290 --> 01:25:33,870
They're behind us.

2697
01:25:34,050 --> 01:25:34,150
Yeah.

2698
01:25:35,550 --> 01:25:36,110
Thor is low.

2699
01:25:37,150 --> 01:25:37,570
That's alright.

2700
01:25:38,410 --> 01:25:38,710
Nice.

2701
01:25:39,370 --> 01:25:40,090
Hey, I'm gonna be on him.

2702
01:25:40,330 --> 01:25:40,450
Shit.

2703
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:42,230
Oh, he almost capped me.

2704
01:25:42,230 --> 01:25:43,810
A little too hard there.

2705
01:25:45,150 --> 01:25:45,770
Jeff have?

2706
01:25:46,090 --> 01:25:47,350
I might be.

2707
01:25:47,830 --> 01:25:48,350
Got his?

2708
01:25:49,790 --> 01:25:50,910
I mean, we're taking a payload.

2709
01:25:51,130 --> 01:25:52,130
They're doing whatever the hell.

2710
01:25:52,350 --> 01:25:53,470
Yeah, I'm just trying to make sure.

2711
01:25:53,970 --> 01:25:54,650
My store is okay.

2712
01:25:55,170 --> 01:25:55,410
Nice.

2713
01:25:57,270 --> 01:25:57,750
Oh, I got you.

2714
01:25:57,830 --> 01:25:58,090
I got you.

2715
01:25:58,690 --> 01:25:59,510
I healed you too.

2716
01:25:59,590 --> 01:25:59,930
Good one.

2717
01:26:01,290 --> 01:26:02,090
Maximum pulse.

2718
01:26:02,150 --> 01:26:03,290
Where the heck was that?

2719
01:26:03,290 --> 01:26:03,910
You are strong.

2720
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:05,530
You are such a loser.

2721
01:26:06,110 --> 01:26:07,870
You are such a loser.

2722
01:26:08,190 --> 01:26:08,830
Oh, my God.

2723
01:26:08,910 --> 01:26:09,450
Rock and low.

2724
01:26:09,610 --> 01:26:10,210
Rock and low.

2725
01:26:11,490 --> 01:26:11,750
Rock and low.

2726
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:12,090
Rock and low.

2727
01:26:12,930 --> 01:26:13,430
Yeah, they are, man.

2728
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:15,710
Nice.

2729
01:26:16,390 --> 01:26:16,730
Nice.

2730
01:26:18,010 --> 01:26:19,430
What did he do to you?

2731
01:26:23,150 --> 01:26:24,210
I'm about to quit.

2732
01:26:24,390 --> 01:26:24,750
Sorry.

2733
01:26:25,130 --> 01:26:26,630
Did you hold?

2734
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:26,910
Yeah.

2735
01:26:27,270 --> 01:26:28,110
So, again.

2736
01:26:28,370 --> 01:26:29,810
Again, I really remind y'all, man.

2737
01:26:29,970 --> 01:26:31,130
Like, it's been some weeks, bro.

2738
01:26:31,830 --> 01:26:33,350
What did he do to you?

2739
01:26:33,610 --> 01:26:34,250
I, yeah.

2740
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:35,730
Hey, yeah.

2741
01:26:35,910 --> 01:26:36,770
No, everyone's laughing.

2742
01:26:36,930 --> 01:26:37,210
I see.

2743
01:26:37,410 --> 01:26:37,590
Okay.

2744
01:26:38,730 --> 01:26:39,190
It's all right.

2745
01:26:39,270 --> 01:26:39,570
You're here.

2746
01:26:39,570 --> 01:26:40,270
I just walked here.

2747
01:26:40,350 --> 01:26:41,290
I need the cardio, so.

2748
01:26:42,570 --> 01:26:42,930
Okay.

2749
01:26:43,850 --> 01:26:45,130
Wait, Bugger's doing weird shit.

2750
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:45,910
I don't like that.

2751
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:46,430
Where is Bugger?

2752
01:26:46,530 --> 01:26:47,150
What the fuck?

2753
01:26:47,650 --> 01:26:48,410
I didn't like that.

2754
01:26:48,450 --> 01:26:49,690
What the fuck is that?

2755
01:26:50,210 --> 01:26:50,870
I might need hills.

2756
01:26:51,170 --> 01:26:51,390
Thank you.

2757
01:26:57,940 --> 01:26:58,480
Oh, my God.

2758
01:26:58,540 --> 01:26:59,860
I just realized I'm not using my crosshair.

2759
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:00,060
All right.

2760
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:01,520
We should have Strangel coming up soon.

2761
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:03,280
But I'm tickling their eye, man.

2762
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:04,240
He is not taking test.

2763
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:09,280
I just realized I have been on default crosshair this entire time.

2764
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:11,260
Yeah, I got default on.

2765
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:11,880
Okay.

2766
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,020
It's too easy to do it.

2767
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:14,540
I forgot about that.

2768
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:18,760
There's two in there.

2769
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:20,200
That guy hates you, Rage.

2770
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:20,500
Oh, my God.

2771
01:27:20,620 --> 01:27:21,900
This guy hates you, bro.

2772
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:23,300
Try this half?

2773
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:24,460
Oh.

2774
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:26,640
Oh, what the fuck?

2775
01:27:27,460 --> 01:27:29,080
I got it.

2776
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:29,280
I got it.

2777
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:30,440
Two can ult.

2778
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:31,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2779
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:35,380
Okay.

2780
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,780
Oh, we amped up.

2781
01:27:36,940 --> 01:27:37,380
We amped up.

2782
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:37,900
Nice, nice, nice.

2783
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:37,960
Guys.

2784
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,060
Guys, we're doing it, guys.

2785
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:41,360
We're doing it.

2786
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:41,400
Oh, not in there.

2787
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:42,300
Oh, hell no.

2788
01:27:42,820 --> 01:27:43,620
I think I'll be doing it.

2789
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:44,560
Oh, shoot.

2790
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:45,940
You're so fast.

2791
01:27:46,420 --> 01:27:46,500
Oh, my God.

2792
01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:47,740
You can just keep up with me.

2793
01:27:50,380 --> 01:27:51,180
I keep...

2794
01:27:51,180 --> 01:27:51,520
Oh, my God.

2795
01:27:51,620 --> 01:27:52,400
Left click not heal.

2796
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:53,780
Click not heal.

2797
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:54,820
Fuck.

2798
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:55,900
You're welcome.

2799
01:27:57,340 --> 01:27:58,240
I'm not missing this dude.

2800
01:27:58,880 --> 01:27:59,400
I'm out of here.

2801
01:27:59,700 --> 01:27:59,900
I'm out of here.

2802
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:01,900
Oh, my God.

2803
01:28:01,980 --> 01:28:02,780
The damage boost.

2804
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:03,600
Oh, fuck.

2805
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:04,280
That's scary.

2806
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:18,180
Oh, my God.

2807
01:28:18,180 --> 01:28:19,480
You guys are getting bowed down.

2808
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:20,660
I can't out heal that.

2809
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:22,960
I don't think me and Rocket can out heal that.

2810
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:25,560
Oh.

2811
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:27,000
You're safe.

2812
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:27,600
Don't worry.

2813
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:28,660
Happy thoughts, Dale.

2814
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:29,160
Happy thoughts.

2815
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:29,620
Don't die.

2816
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:31,500
He's low.

2817
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:31,940
Slow.

2818
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:32,500
Nice, nice, nice.

2819
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:34,340
I'll try slow.

2820
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:35,000
I'll try slow too.

2821
01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:35,360
Nice.

2822
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:35,980
I got two.

2823
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:36,980
I give you shield.

2824
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:37,740
Amazing.

2825
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:40,860
Oh, I'm flying up.

2826
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:42,040
I'm flying up.

2827
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:42,940
No, no, no, no.

2828
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:43,660
No, no, no, no.

2829
01:28:43,660 --> 01:28:43,980
You're fine.

2830
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:45,600
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

2831
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:46,700
Wait, where is he?

2832
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:47,280
Where is he?

2833
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:48,380
Agent.

2834
01:28:48,380 --> 01:28:48,480
Agent.

2835
01:28:48,700 --> 01:28:49,380
That meant life.

2836
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:51,080
I saw how I was defending that ult.

2837
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:57,900
Oh, he was one.

2838
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:02,240
I didn't realize there was a TP.

2839
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:07,320
Iron man low.

2840
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:07,900
Iron man low.

2841
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:09,280
Iron man low.

2842
01:29:09,620 --> 01:29:09,800
Oh, what?

2843
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:13,820
Damn Iron man old.

2844
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:15,440
But I have mine, Gale.

2845
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:16,240
Okay.

2846
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:17,540
Yeah, we can easily walk in.

2847
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:18,860
All right.

2848
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:20,620
Let's get it.

2849
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:22,680
Let's get it.

2850
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:23,580
Let's get it.

2851
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:24,360
Let's get it.

2852
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:25,180
Okay.

2853
01:29:25,180 --> 01:29:25,300
Okay.

2854
01:29:25,420 --> 01:29:26,020
Nice.

2855
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:29,960
Yo, where did you go, bro?

2856
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:31,120
Okay, I got you.

2857
01:29:32,420 --> 01:29:33,640
Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.

2858
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:35,660
Watch this.

2859
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:38,980
We did it!

2860
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:41,440
We went crazy!

2861
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:45,640
We went nuts!

2862
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:47,000
We went crazy!

2863
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:49,960
Yes, sir!

2864
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:52,280
Oh, my God.

2865
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:52,680
Agent.

2866
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:56,180
I like the final hits out of you.

2867
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:57,000
You feel me?

2868
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:58,820
I like them out of you.

2869
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:01,260
We did it.

2870
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:02,520
That was awesome.

2871
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:03,880
Oh, my God.

2872
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:06,260
I keep forgetting my shift a lot.

2873
01:30:07,460 --> 01:30:08,660
We try our best.

2874
01:30:09,580 --> 01:30:11,340
Ultron heals is not a lot, guys.

2875
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:13,620
I can't heal myself on Ultron.

2876
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:15,660
And, like, I have to...

2877
01:30:16,340 --> 01:30:18,720
This is my first time on a flyer support.

2878
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:19,520
So, like...

2879
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:19,640
Yeah.

2880
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:22,420
I'll try to heal this.

2881
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:24,600
Is anyone here, like, semi-competent at Widow?

2882
01:30:24,940 --> 01:30:25,220
Because...

2883
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:26,420
I am not at all.

2884
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:27,800
I can play it.

2885
01:30:27,860 --> 01:30:28,240
I can play it.

2886
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:29,200
Alright.

2887
01:30:29,660 --> 01:30:30,940
No, no, but, like, we need...

2888
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:31,620
No, we need...

2889
01:30:31,620 --> 01:30:33,140
Can someone else play Punisher, then?

2890
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:34,880
Who's got the...

2891
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,040
I want to see the Necro's Punisher.

2892
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:37,760
I've never seen that ever before.

2893
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:38,300
Oh, I don't know about that.

2894
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:38,840
I don't know about that.

2895
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:41,000
That's, like, never been whooped out ever before.

2896
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:42,360
Yes, you gotta whooped out for one time.

2897
01:30:42,380 --> 01:30:42,720
Oh, no.

2898
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:43,820
For the one time.

2899
01:30:43,820 --> 01:30:43,920
For the one time.

2900
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:44,800
Okay.

2901
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:46,200
Yes.

2902
01:30:46,700 --> 01:30:47,640
Alright, alright, I'll show you.

2903
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:47,980
I'll show you.

2904
01:30:48,220 --> 01:30:49,200
This is great news.

2905
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:49,780
Let's see.

2906
01:30:49,900 --> 01:30:52,160
Oh, they don't have the Rocket Punisher team up anymore.

2907
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:52,880
Some hidden talents about to...

2908
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:53,840
That's better hidden.

2909
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:55,840
Uh...

2910
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:56,620
Really, really hidden.

2911
01:30:59,280 --> 01:30:59,880
Super hidden.

2912
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:02,780
I don't know what support to play.

2913
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,040
We don't have any other team ups, right?

2914
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:05,200
Uh...

2915
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:05,760
I'll just go Jeff.

2916
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:06,840
Coming in 30 seconds.

2917
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:07,720
Stay strong.

2918
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:10,540
Oh, wait.

2919
01:31:12,620 --> 01:31:13,100
Hmm...

2920
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:14,940
You guys think Jeff and Ultron healing is enough?

2921
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:18,600
Eh...

2922
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:19,680
Like, pretty weak, right?

2923
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:22,340
What is it?

2924
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:23,720
Ultron and Jeff heals.

2925
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:24,280
Oh...

2926
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:25,020
It might be fine.

2927
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:26,040
Yeah.

2928
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:26,920
It might be a little weak.

2929
01:31:27,180 --> 01:31:28,800
If it's too weak, I'll swap.

2930
01:31:29,380 --> 01:31:30,880
The battle starts in five...

2931
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:32,200
Four...

2932
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:33,400
Three...

2933
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:33,840
Two...

2934
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:34,800
One...

2935
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:35,800
One...

2936
01:31:39,980 --> 01:31:41,380
One...

2937
01:31:41,380 --> 01:31:41,420
One...

2938
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:44,740
Two...

2939
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:46,720
Two...

2940
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:51,480
One...

2941
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:51,640
One...

2942
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:51,800
One...

2943
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:51,840
One...

2944
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:51,860
One...

2945
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:55,140
One...

2946
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:56,000
One...

2947
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:56,660
One...

2948
01:31:56,660 --> 01:31:57,460
One...

2949
01:31:57,460 --> 01:31:58,120
One...

2950
01:31:58,120 --> 01:31:59,900
One...

2951
01:32:11,970 --> 01:32:13,370
One...

2952
01:32:23,510 --> 01:32:24,730
Oh, tell me.

2953
01:32:24,850 --> 01:32:25,050
You're alive.

2954
01:32:25,470 --> 01:32:25,630
Alright.

2955
01:32:30,110 --> 01:32:31,290
Send up the turret.

2956
01:32:33,710 --> 01:32:34,830
I see.

2957
01:32:35,230 --> 01:32:37,010
When you're not pushing card, that's good.

2958
01:32:37,810 --> 01:32:39,530
We have more time to reset ourselves.

2959
01:32:40,030 --> 01:32:40,430
Plasma?

2960
01:32:41,570 --> 01:32:41,850
Oh.

2961
01:32:44,510 --> 01:32:45,790
Oh, we're all so slow.

2962
01:32:46,810 --> 01:32:47,090
Alright.

2963
01:32:47,090 --> 01:32:47,210
Judge.

2964
01:32:48,210 --> 01:32:48,530
Jury.

2965
01:32:49,810 --> 01:32:50,130
Execution.

2966
01:32:50,170 --> 01:32:51,110
Good luck, everyone.

2967
01:32:55,450 --> 01:32:56,090
I got one.

2968
01:32:56,390 --> 01:32:57,050
Oh, no.

2969
01:33:00,290 --> 01:33:01,810
It's like I'm being shot on the show.

2970
01:33:02,870 --> 01:33:04,070
I'll draw it back here.

2971
01:33:07,170 --> 01:33:08,210
Is that 908?

2972
01:33:09,330 --> 01:33:09,970
Where am I?

2973
01:33:10,550 --> 01:33:11,690
Good shit, good shit, good shit, good shit.

2974
01:33:13,350 --> 01:33:14,710
I don't even know where they are.

2975
01:33:14,850 --> 01:33:15,310
Where are they?

2976
01:33:15,510 --> 01:33:15,810
Where are they?

2977
01:33:15,910 --> 01:33:16,630
I'm just holding air.

2978
01:33:16,630 --> 01:33:18,550
You killed him.

2979
01:33:18,770 --> 01:33:20,070
Wait, Uda and I saw him.

2980
01:33:20,390 --> 01:33:20,990
Hello, guys.

2981
01:33:21,050 --> 01:33:23,090
I'm going to take a TP.

2982
01:33:24,290 --> 01:33:25,350
Where am I going?

2983
01:33:25,650 --> 01:33:26,410
I don't know.

2984
01:33:26,730 --> 01:33:27,410
Where are we?

2985
01:33:27,810 --> 01:33:27,950
What the fuck?

2986
01:33:28,110 --> 01:33:28,710
Where am I?

2987
01:33:28,950 --> 01:33:29,690
Lock it in.

2988
01:33:29,870 --> 01:33:30,310
I'm behind them.

2989
01:33:30,590 --> 01:33:31,350
It's a strat.

2990
01:33:31,470 --> 01:33:32,030
We're behind them.

2991
01:33:33,010 --> 01:33:34,130
They didn't expect it.

2992
01:33:35,550 --> 01:33:36,730
I didn't expect it.

2993
01:33:37,970 --> 01:33:39,290
The teams did it, I think.

2994
01:33:41,030 --> 01:33:41,770
Let's go, Agent.

2995
01:33:42,270 --> 01:33:43,010
Let's go, Agent.

2996
01:33:43,170 --> 01:33:43,990
Let's get up in the corner.

2997
01:33:44,510 --> 01:33:44,890
Let's go, Agent.

2998
01:33:45,990 --> 01:33:46,750
I got my ult.

2999
01:33:46,970 --> 01:33:47,550
I got my ult.

3000
01:33:47,810 --> 01:33:48,330
I'm going to go crazy.

3001
01:33:48,450 --> 01:33:49,450
Wait, where are you guys?

3002
01:33:50,490 --> 01:33:51,230
How's the ult?

3003
01:33:51,530 --> 01:33:51,790
Oh my god.

3004
01:33:52,030 --> 01:33:52,750
Maybe I got you.

3005
01:33:53,330 --> 01:33:54,890
Oh, I don't think you got him.

3006
01:33:55,390 --> 01:33:55,790
Oh, no.

3007
01:33:57,550 --> 01:33:58,330
Oh, shit.

3008
01:34:00,390 --> 01:34:00,790
Agent.

3009
01:34:02,330 --> 01:34:02,950
GG, bro.

3010
01:34:04,610 --> 01:34:05,270
Yeah, I almost fucked up.

3011
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:07,010
Hey, hey, they're like solo ult in me.

3012
01:34:07,430 --> 01:34:09,210
They must be afraid of me or something, man.

3013
01:34:09,390 --> 01:34:10,450
I can't fucking get out.

3014
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:10,870
Fuck.

3015
01:34:11,230 --> 01:34:12,150
It's so weird.

3016
01:34:13,310 --> 01:34:14,170
How's the Teemo feel?

3017
01:34:15,530 --> 01:34:16,550
I like it.

3018
01:34:17,470 --> 01:34:19,330
It's not the greatest, but it's not terrible.

3019
01:34:20,390 --> 01:34:21,510
They hit a checkpoint.

3020
01:34:22,070 --> 01:34:22,350
Alright.

3021
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:22,930
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

3022
01:34:23,010 --> 01:34:23,550
Don't go that way.

3023
01:34:23,550 --> 01:34:24,330
We might have more heals now.

3024
01:34:27,670 --> 01:34:28,510
Let's see what happened here.

3025
01:34:28,610 --> 01:34:29,450
What did that big burst...

3026
01:34:29,450 --> 01:34:29,890
What was that?

3027
01:34:30,010 --> 01:34:30,970
What was the big burst right there?

3028
01:34:34,430 --> 01:34:35,610
Oh, you were like above.

3029
01:34:36,290 --> 01:34:37,070
I couldn't see you.

3030
01:34:39,630 --> 01:34:40,250
Oh my god.

3031
01:34:40,890 --> 01:34:41,610
I did not see that guy.

3032
01:34:47,190 --> 01:34:48,110
Oh, you're safe.

3033
01:34:48,830 --> 01:34:49,270
Oh, I got my ult.

3034
01:34:49,370 --> 01:34:49,730
I got my ult.

3035
01:34:50,070 --> 01:34:50,270
I'm ready.

3036
01:34:51,250 --> 01:34:52,050
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready.

3037
01:34:52,050 --> 01:34:53,870
Come on!

3038
01:34:54,310 --> 01:34:54,910
I've conored.

3039
01:34:55,090 --> 01:34:57,530
But doing this his way.

3040
01:34:57,890 --> 01:34:58,790
Oh, oh shit.

3041
01:34:59,390 --> 01:35:00,670
I think he is almost strong.

3042
01:35:03,270 --> 01:35:06,450
Yeah we gotta regroup, guys.

3043
01:35:10,330 --> 01:35:11,130
Yo i need...

3044
01:35:11,130 --> 01:35:12,050
Alright, myaaaa...

3045
01:35:14,170 --> 01:35:14,830
Oh no.

3046
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:17,670
I do need heals too.

3047
01:35:19,550 --> 01:35:20,850
Oh, try no.

3048
01:35:23,430 --> 01:35:27,770
Oh my god, there's so many flyers now.

3049
01:35:29,450 --> 01:35:31,050
Yeah, they didn't even push the cart, like, at all.

3050
01:35:31,310 --> 01:35:31,430
Yeah.

3051
01:35:31,990 --> 01:35:33,150
I think there's a Widow behind, by the way.

3052
01:35:36,730 --> 01:35:37,630
I got the Red Beacon.

3053
01:35:38,090 --> 01:35:38,530
Oh, nice.

3054
01:35:38,850 --> 01:35:40,270
Ooh, I like that out of you.

3055
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:50,640
I froze somebody.

3056
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:53,160
I got it, but I'm on me.

3057
01:35:54,100 --> 01:35:54,700
I got you.

3058
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:57,480
Okay.

3059
01:35:57,480 --> 01:35:58,160
I'm beaming him.

3060
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:01,160
Pretty low.

3061
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:01,520
What?

3062
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:04,060
Ooh, the Hulk.

3063
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:04,720
I like that.

3064
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:05,580
Oh my god, are you okay?

3065
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:07,120
I can't heal you, though, over there.

3066
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:08,620
I'm so fine.

3067
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:09,340
I'm so fine.

3068
01:36:09,340 --> 01:36:09,640
I'm dead.

3069
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:14,380
I have to reload.

3070
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:14,840
I have to reload.

3071
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:15,200
Sorry.

3072
01:36:19,340 --> 01:36:20,200
Oh, Widow is one.

3073
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:22,260
Back you.

3074
01:36:24,140 --> 01:36:24,560
Nice heals.

3075
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:26,440
Wait, then I'm gonna die here.

3076
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:27,920
Oh.

3077
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:29,060
Nice.

3078
01:36:29,620 --> 01:36:29,780
I'm dead.

3079
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:30,560
Oh, it's fine.

3080
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:30,860
I'm sorry.

3081
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:33,920
Can I get some of that?

3082
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:36,500
He's one.

3083
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:37,140
Thanks for the shield.

3084
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:39,320
Four.

3085
01:36:39,620 --> 01:36:39,980
Three.

3086
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:40,700
Two.

3087
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:41,540
One.

3088
01:36:43,420 --> 01:36:44,020
Nice.

3089
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:44,700
Yeah.

3090
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:44,980
Nice.

3091
01:36:46,540 --> 01:36:47,260
Let's go.

3092
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:52,080
Yay, we're alive.

3093
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:54,100
Target neutralized.

3094
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:55,040
Oh my god.

3095
01:36:55,860 --> 01:36:57,520
I don't know if he'll be alive.

3096
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:57,780
Oh.

3097
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:00,220
Please.

3098
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:01,160
Please, thank you.

3099
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:04,860
I got my ult.

3100
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:08,520
Agent.

3101
01:37:08,860 --> 01:37:09,600
I got you.

3102
01:37:13,340 --> 01:37:13,980
Yeah.

3103
01:37:15,180 --> 01:37:15,440
Okay.

3104
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:15,980
Oh.

3105
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:21,440
This is like a sniper off right now.

3106
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:25,380
Oh, fuck!

3107
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,500
How did he get there?

3108
01:37:30,060 --> 01:37:30,500
Jury.

3109
01:37:32,020 --> 01:37:32,460
Executioner!

3110
01:37:35,260 --> 01:37:36,940
I've still got songs to sing.

3111
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:42,560
It's go time.

3112
01:37:43,140 --> 01:37:45,300
I have my ult, by the way.

3113
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:46,720
Oh, no, no, no, no.

3114
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:47,700
Maybe, uh...

3115
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:48,920
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

3116
01:37:49,180 --> 01:37:49,640
I'm leaving.

3117
01:37:49,980 --> 01:37:50,340
Wait!

3118
01:37:50,620 --> 01:37:50,740
Wait!

3119
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:51,340
You got one!

3120
01:37:53,220 --> 01:37:54,580
I thought I was the main character there.

3121
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:56,220
Oh my god, he's bragging?

3122
01:37:57,100 --> 01:37:58,480
You better stop that vehicle!

3123
01:37:58,580 --> 01:37:59,520
Oh, close!

3124
01:38:01,780 --> 01:38:02,180
So close.

3125
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:03,280
I don't know if I want to peek that.

3126
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:08,460
Alright, good luck to you two.

3127
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:12,040
Oh, he's won.

3128
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:13,180
We went to touch point.

3129
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:13,300
I'll get touch.

3130
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:15,380
Who's got that?

3131
01:38:16,060 --> 01:38:16,860
None of us.

3132
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:17,280
I don't got it.

3133
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:19,300
I don't see we... none of us.

3134
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:20,820
We went to touch point.

3135
01:38:24,010 --> 01:38:25,490
That was a little low.

3136
01:38:28,770 --> 01:38:29,310
Noooo...

3137
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:33,350
Fucking three of them swung me on the left.

3138
01:38:33,490 --> 01:38:33,810
What the hell?

3139
01:38:35,150 --> 01:38:36,050
Going too much.

3140
01:38:37,350 --> 01:38:37,450
Oh!

3141
01:38:44,390 --> 01:38:46,610
Oh my god, Chad.

3142
01:38:49,270 --> 01:38:50,350
Okay, um...

3143
01:38:50,350 --> 01:38:51,850
Let's do a bit of a grouping.

3144
01:38:51,850 --> 01:38:52,650
I'm 1hp.

3145
01:38:52,650 --> 01:38:53,210
Group up.

3146
01:38:53,290 --> 01:38:53,510
Any help.

3147
01:38:54,290 --> 01:38:54,810
Any help.

3148
01:38:58,450 --> 01:39:00,810
I'm sure there's one.

3149
01:39:09,670 --> 01:39:10,890
Wait, there's someone behind me.

3150
01:39:11,190 --> 01:39:11,970
Is that him behind me?

3151
01:39:12,450 --> 01:39:13,350
Oh, I couldn't see him.

3152
01:39:13,410 --> 01:39:13,650
I got you.

3153
01:39:16,830 --> 01:39:17,310
Reload?

3154
01:39:17,570 --> 01:39:18,790
What's he doing over here?

3155
01:39:19,670 --> 01:39:20,570
He's coming back.

3156
01:39:23,290 --> 01:39:23,810
Nice.

3157
01:39:23,810 --> 01:39:23,910
Nice.

3158
01:39:24,810 --> 01:39:25,510
Sniper to...

3159
01:39:25,510 --> 01:39:26,290
Widow to left.

3160
01:39:27,250 --> 01:39:28,570
I need heal, so...

3161
01:39:38,290 --> 01:39:41,810
No, this map is so confusing, because everything's the same color.

3162
01:39:42,030 --> 01:39:42,430
No, like...

3163
01:39:42,430 --> 01:39:42,690
So, like...

3164
01:39:42,690 --> 01:39:43,990
It's more so of, like...

3165
01:39:43,990 --> 01:39:44,970
Trying to figure out...

3166
01:39:44,970 --> 01:39:45,750
He's so much healing.

3167
01:39:46,150 --> 01:39:49,250
Like, learning this map for me in my first try.

3168
01:39:49,470 --> 01:39:49,950
Little split.

3169
01:39:50,530 --> 01:39:50,770
Oh.

3170
01:39:51,910 --> 01:39:52,590
That was toughy.

3171
01:39:53,550 --> 01:39:54,750
Yeah, I mean...

3172
01:39:54,750 --> 01:39:55,370
I think I'm down on player.

3173
01:39:59,990 --> 01:40:01,170
I don't think you want me in Iron Man.

3174
01:40:01,670 --> 01:40:02,110
I tried.

3175
01:40:02,610 --> 01:40:03,790
It's kind of tough into, uh...

3176
01:40:03,790 --> 01:40:04,310
Two hitscans.

3177
01:40:05,050 --> 01:40:06,250
Especially when they happen to be, uh...

3178
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:07,370
Pretty fucking good at hitscans.

3179
01:40:08,750 --> 01:40:09,870
And a first time in this group.

3180
01:40:10,270 --> 01:40:10,530
It's a bit tough.

3181
01:40:15,290 --> 01:40:16,270
I think you did great.

3182
01:40:16,370 --> 01:40:16,410
I think you did great.

3183
01:40:16,410 --> 01:40:16,650
All good.

3184
01:40:17,110 --> 01:40:17,770
You think I did great?

3185
01:40:19,090 --> 01:40:19,650
I was lying.

3186
01:40:19,670 --> 01:40:19,990
Thank you.

3187
01:40:20,770 --> 01:40:21,550
Wait, did you ult?

3188
01:40:21,850 --> 01:40:22,170
Necros?

3189
01:40:22,990 --> 01:40:23,630
Yeah, yeah, I did.

3190
01:40:23,730 --> 01:40:24,270
I was ulting.

3191
01:40:24,730 --> 01:40:25,330
Oh, okay.

3192
01:40:25,970 --> 01:40:27,390
Yeah, one time it was a wall.

3193
01:40:27,690 --> 01:40:28,570
And then the other time it was...

3194
01:40:29,530 --> 01:40:30,130
The ground.

3195
01:40:30,490 --> 01:40:30,650
Oh.

3196
01:40:31,110 --> 01:40:31,430
It was great.

3197
01:40:33,430 --> 01:40:33,930
Variety, right?

3198
01:40:35,490 --> 01:40:36,590
I'm gonna have the Hawkeye here.

3199
01:40:37,490 --> 01:40:37,990
Yeah, please.

3200
01:40:39,110 --> 01:40:39,690
Got you.

3201
01:40:41,070 --> 01:40:42,250
Maybe do Luna for the team-up.

3202
01:40:42,390 --> 01:40:43,010
Oh, yeah, you want Luna?

3203
01:40:43,310 --> 01:40:45,110
And then I do Iron Fist for your team-up.

3204
01:40:45,390 --> 01:40:46,250
No, you do Luna, you do Luna.

3205
01:40:46,370 --> 01:40:46,770
Oh, I do that?

3206
01:40:46,870 --> 01:40:47,050
Okay.

3207
01:40:47,690 --> 01:40:48,850
Big team-ups, big team-ups.

3208
01:40:49,350 --> 01:40:50,870
I actually play this hero, so it's fine.

3209
01:40:51,550 --> 01:40:52,370
I don't even...

3210
01:40:52,370 --> 01:40:54,050
I still don't know where the portals take you.

3211
01:40:54,210 --> 01:40:56,150
I didn't even realize you were portals until the...

3212
01:40:56,150 --> 01:40:56,710
Jeff ate us.

3213
01:40:59,350 --> 01:41:00,850
Yeah, let's see how you use this dual chat.

3214
01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:03,450
Whoa, where am I?

3215
01:41:05,070 --> 01:41:06,490
Oh, wait, it takes me to the front.

3216
01:41:06,490 --> 01:41:08,450
30 seconds before you attack.

3217
01:41:08,830 --> 01:41:09,310
Get ready.

3218
01:41:11,610 --> 01:41:12,690
This is our round, guys.

3219
01:41:14,370 --> 01:41:15,330
Yeah, this is it.

3220
01:41:15,490 --> 01:41:15,930
I believe.

3221
01:41:17,910 --> 01:41:19,870
I don't know how many portals are around this map.

3222
01:41:20,770 --> 01:41:21,610
I don't know.

3223
01:41:23,070 --> 01:41:25,410
Oh, there's a bunch on first point and then...

3224
01:41:26,110 --> 01:41:28,910
I think there's none on second and there's like two on third.

3225
01:41:29,110 --> 01:41:31,350
Do they open like automatically or like is it time?

3226
01:41:31,350 --> 01:41:32,390
Yeah, yeah, they're open from the start.

3227
01:41:32,690 --> 01:41:32,750
Oh.

3228
01:41:32,870 --> 01:41:35,070
So like the one right in front of us are actually these in a flank.

3229
01:41:35,210 --> 01:41:35,810
Do you guys want to try it?

3230
01:41:35,890 --> 01:41:37,110
What if we all went through the portals?

3231
01:41:37,370 --> 01:41:37,430
Yeah, shit.

3232
01:41:37,430 --> 01:41:38,730
There's a stranger on the left side, I think.

3233
01:41:38,930 --> 01:41:39,250
Oh, okay.

3234
01:41:40,190 --> 01:41:40,510
Oh.

3235
01:41:40,510 --> 01:41:41,370
Oh, they did the Hawkeye.

3236
01:41:41,510 --> 01:41:43,350
Oh, they froze all of us.

3237
01:41:43,430 --> 01:41:44,130
That is crazy.

3238
01:41:44,130 --> 01:41:44,630
I got him.

3239
01:41:44,730 --> 01:41:45,470
Oh, you should do it.

3240
01:41:47,470 --> 01:41:47,750
Nice.

3241
01:41:47,930 --> 01:41:48,810
Hide him through the walls as well.

3242
01:41:48,930 --> 01:41:49,710
Wait, there's a...

3243
01:41:49,710 --> 01:41:50,910
There's an ultron behind us.

3244
01:41:51,030 --> 01:41:51,630
There's an ultron behind us.

3245
01:41:51,710 --> 01:41:52,010
I need help.

3246
01:41:52,010 --> 01:41:52,510
I need heals.

3247
01:41:52,650 --> 01:41:52,870
I need heals.

3248
01:41:53,470 --> 01:41:53,950
Thank you.

3249
01:41:59,570 --> 01:42:00,110
I got him.

3250
01:42:00,370 --> 01:42:00,550
Nice.

3251
01:42:00,750 --> 01:42:01,030
Got him.

3252
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:07,180
Got you.

3253
01:42:09,980 --> 01:42:10,260
Oh.

3254
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:11,460
Are you okay over there?

3255
01:42:12,020 --> 01:42:12,460
Yeah, I'm good.

3256
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:12,640
I'm good.

3257
01:42:13,020 --> 01:42:13,220
Alright.

3258
01:42:13,220 --> 01:42:14,120
You're halfway there.

3259
01:42:14,160 --> 01:42:14,960
Keep going.

3260
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:15,860
One.

3261
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:19,380
Up, up, up, up left.

3262
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:20,140
I got you.

3263
01:42:21,740 --> 01:42:22,120
Reload.

3264
01:42:26,550 --> 01:42:27,350
Oh, I need heals.

3265
01:42:27,750 --> 01:42:28,090
I need heals.

3266
01:42:29,390 --> 01:42:29,510
I need heals.

3267
01:42:29,570 --> 01:42:29,630
Thank you.

3268
01:42:34,570 --> 01:42:35,330
Almost there.

3269
01:42:35,850 --> 01:42:36,810
Oh, rock it low.

3270
01:42:41,470 --> 01:42:41,850
Yo.

3271
01:42:42,910 --> 01:42:43,790
There's a penny on the left.

3272
01:42:44,390 --> 01:42:45,090
Penny on the left.

3273
01:42:45,250 --> 01:42:45,350
Penny on the left.

3274
01:42:45,350 --> 01:42:46,370
Are they still in penny half?

3275
01:42:46,630 --> 01:42:46,830
One?

3276
01:42:48,370 --> 01:42:48,790
I'm cooking.

3277
01:42:49,750 --> 01:42:50,070
Nice.

3278
01:42:50,290 --> 01:42:51,690
Chat, I think I'm carrying ultron for real.

3279
01:42:53,370 --> 01:42:53,690
Go.

3280
01:42:56,630 --> 01:42:56,950
Alright.

3281
01:42:57,330 --> 01:42:58,570
I don't know, Chris, you have the...

3282
01:42:58,570 --> 01:42:58,850
Gale.

3283
01:42:58,990 --> 01:43:00,430
We gotta set up like a combo.

3284
01:43:00,630 --> 01:43:00,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3285
01:43:01,670 --> 01:43:03,150
We gotta set up a combo with you and me.

3286
01:43:03,930 --> 01:43:06,970
Like, you shoot through the wall with your C on my ult or something.

3287
01:43:07,870 --> 01:43:08,070
Okay.

3288
01:43:08,150 --> 01:43:08,410
I don't know.

3289
01:43:08,750 --> 01:43:08,990
Whoa.

3290
01:43:09,270 --> 01:43:09,530
Bye.

3291
01:43:09,770 --> 01:43:10,930
I no longer push.

3292
01:43:12,350 --> 01:43:12,730
Uh...

3293
01:43:13,930 --> 01:43:14,810
I'm pushing cart.

3294
01:43:14,970 --> 01:43:15,350
Oh!

3295
01:43:16,470 --> 01:43:16,850
Goodbye.

3296
01:43:17,530 --> 01:43:18,830
I could eat this thing, probably.

3297
01:43:19,890 --> 01:43:20,650
Uh, you're only here.

3298
01:43:20,790 --> 01:43:21,650
There's cart duty.

3299
01:43:21,990 --> 01:43:22,490
Right there, right there, right there.

3300
01:43:24,610 --> 01:43:25,030
To the shield.

3301
01:43:26,310 --> 01:43:26,970
Oh, I got you.

3302
01:43:29,470 --> 01:43:30,450
Wait, that wall, by the wall?

3303
01:43:30,570 --> 01:43:30,710
Oh.

3304
01:43:32,210 --> 01:43:33,230
I had to freeze on someone.

3305
01:43:35,550 --> 01:43:37,110
A nice, deep freeze.

3306
01:43:37,730 --> 01:43:38,750
Thanks for the shield.

3307
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:39,870
Ooh.

3308
01:43:40,110 --> 01:43:40,990
Be strong together.

3309
01:43:41,290 --> 01:43:41,810
Oh.

3310
01:43:42,450 --> 01:43:42,870
Oh my god.

3311
01:43:44,010 --> 01:43:44,290
Oh no.

3312
01:43:44,790 --> 01:43:46,010
Shoot me through that wall.

3313
01:43:46,330 --> 01:43:47,970
I could shoot me through that wall.

3314
01:43:48,890 --> 01:43:49,390
Thank you.

3315
01:43:51,870 --> 01:43:52,990
I could not move my position.

3316
01:44:00,130 --> 01:44:00,510
Oh.

3317
01:44:01,350 --> 01:44:01,910
Goodbye.

3318
01:44:03,550 --> 01:44:04,110
Nice.

3319
01:44:04,330 --> 01:44:05,290
That broke is so fast.

3320
01:44:05,290 --> 01:44:05,370
That broke is so fast.

3321
01:44:06,310 --> 01:44:07,570
I like the balls.

3322
01:44:15,210 --> 01:44:16,310
We're doing it.

3323
01:44:16,950 --> 01:44:17,730
Oh, portal?

3324
01:44:19,150 --> 01:44:19,950
What the fuck?

3325
01:44:21,030 --> 01:44:22,910
Oh, he did the clip.

3326
01:44:23,170 --> 01:44:23,650
He did the funny.

3327
01:44:23,910 --> 01:44:24,410
Yeah, yeah.

3328
01:44:27,050 --> 01:44:29,050
He used to do that so much in ranked back in the day.

3329
01:44:29,230 --> 01:44:30,310
It kind of works sometimes too.

3330
01:44:31,070 --> 01:44:32,370
Because nobody does it anymore.

3331
01:44:37,310 --> 01:44:38,370
Wait, Raccoon's low.

3332
01:44:38,410 --> 01:44:38,810
Nice.

3333
01:44:38,990 --> 01:44:39,350
I'm hitting him.

3334
01:44:39,490 --> 01:44:41,990
I got him, I got him.

3335
01:44:42,610 --> 01:44:43,290
You're going left side, yeah.

3336
01:44:43,690 --> 01:44:44,210
Wait, Luna, Luna.

3337
01:44:44,530 --> 01:44:44,870
Nice.

3338
01:44:47,370 --> 01:44:47,770
Kill.

3339
01:44:52,390 --> 01:44:54,370
Luger's trying to make a cliff farm right now.

3340
01:45:01,010 --> 01:45:03,230
Wait, where the fuck are you?

3341
01:45:03,230 --> 01:45:05,630
Nah, he fucking body blocked it.

3342
01:45:05,830 --> 01:45:06,050
Oh, no.

3343
01:45:08,010 --> 01:45:08,670
That's evil.

3344
01:45:15,110 --> 01:45:16,050
He's got drone.

3345
01:45:18,050 --> 01:45:18,850
Got you?

3346
01:45:23,230 --> 01:45:25,030
There's a mag behind us, by the way.

3347
01:45:26,230 --> 01:45:28,490
Nah, Hawkeye is too powerful.

3348
01:45:29,850 --> 01:45:30,530
He's pretty strong.

3349
01:45:30,910 --> 01:45:31,270
He's pretty strong.

3350
01:45:31,270 --> 01:45:32,890
Or is this because it might just be Shraff.

3351
01:45:33,110 --> 01:45:34,530
It's just a team up.

3352
01:45:35,670 --> 01:45:35,790
It's just a team up.

3353
01:45:35,790 --> 01:45:36,350
Team up is not strong right now.

3354
01:45:36,390 --> 01:45:37,610
Yeah, that team up is so strong, actually.

3355
01:45:37,810 --> 01:45:38,190
It's crazy.

3356
01:45:41,410 --> 01:45:42,750
Thank you for the ramp, Groot.

3357
01:45:43,690 --> 01:45:44,350
Oh, nice.

3358
01:45:45,030 --> 01:45:45,830
It's a really big ult.

3359
01:45:46,430 --> 01:45:47,170
It's really big.

3360
01:45:50,250 --> 01:45:50,810
Oh, I got you.

3361
01:45:50,810 --> 01:45:51,870
I'm gonna one tap the Luna right now.

3362
01:45:53,890 --> 01:45:55,430
Fucking strange in my face.

3363
01:45:56,810 --> 01:45:57,510
Here you go.

3364
01:46:01,010 --> 01:46:01,470
Oh.

3365
01:46:01,810 --> 01:46:02,270
Goodbye.

3366
01:46:03,890 --> 01:46:03,950
Goodbye.

3367
01:46:04,670 --> 01:46:05,010
Where I lived.

3368
01:46:08,210 --> 01:46:08,930
They're alive.

3369
01:46:09,450 --> 01:46:10,090
Look at those rockets.

3370
01:46:10,710 --> 01:46:11,230
He could be there.

3371
01:46:12,790 --> 01:46:14,010
Hey, I'm moving the objective.

3372
01:46:14,710 --> 01:46:15,110
Come on.

3373
01:46:16,850 --> 01:46:17,550
Hawkeye on top.

3374
01:46:17,630 --> 01:46:18,030
Can we push him?

3375
01:46:18,250 --> 01:46:20,410
Yeah, there's an Ultron and Hawkeye on top.

3376
01:46:21,170 --> 01:46:23,330
Oh, he's a shot.

3377
01:46:23,630 --> 01:46:24,030
He's one.

3378
01:46:25,630 --> 01:46:26,870
I'm popping my ult in their back lane.

3379
01:46:27,030 --> 01:46:27,630
I'm going now.

3380
01:46:29,530 --> 01:46:30,470
Booger, booger, booger.

3381
01:46:32,130 --> 01:46:32,650
That's right.

3382
01:46:34,390 --> 01:46:35,630
Yeah, he got my flank.

3383
01:46:37,190 --> 01:46:38,010
Get out, get out, get out.

3384
01:46:38,990 --> 01:46:40,050
I'm damage boosting.

3385
01:46:40,830 --> 01:46:42,090
And now I'm scared.

3386
01:46:42,990 --> 01:46:43,330
Dead.

3387
01:46:43,330 --> 01:46:43,830
Oh, nice.

3388
01:46:44,750 --> 01:46:45,430
Oh my god, there's a guy.

3389
01:46:46,030 --> 01:46:46,470
Oh my god.

3390
01:46:48,050 --> 01:46:49,630
Oh, I'm gonna win, I'm gonna win.

3391
01:46:50,270 --> 01:46:50,730
Wait, lock it.

3392
01:46:50,810 --> 01:46:51,430
Job's not done.

3393
01:46:52,150 --> 01:46:52,510
Yay!

3394
01:46:53,170 --> 01:46:53,850
Oh, I'm mad.

3395
01:46:54,950 --> 01:46:55,310
Done.

3396
01:46:56,690 --> 01:46:57,290
Let's go.

3397
01:46:59,410 --> 01:47:00,710
It's just Ultron carry, chat.

3398
01:47:00,870 --> 01:47:01,190
I'm telling you.

3399
01:47:03,470 --> 01:47:05,950
I mean, you killed Shurfor, that was pretty sick.

3400
01:47:06,390 --> 01:47:06,810
Feel me?

3401
01:47:08,430 --> 01:47:10,490
So, like, what do you think about that Hawkeye team up?

3402
01:47:10,870 --> 01:47:12,070
Yo, it's insane.

3403
01:47:12,430 --> 01:47:12,870
That's too good.

3404
01:47:12,870 --> 01:47:16,990
Like, you can shoot it through walls, and if you hit someone that you have, like, LS of, it's just a guaranteed kill.

3405
01:47:17,150 --> 01:47:18,630
Unless they get, like, care from their tank.

3406
01:47:19,070 --> 01:47:19,250
Yeah.

3407
01:47:20,490 --> 01:47:21,130
It's insane.

3408
01:47:21,130 --> 01:47:22,610
I wonder how much Ultron charge...

3409
01:47:22,610 --> 01:47:23,890
I forgot I had the frozen cheat.

3410
01:47:23,890 --> 01:47:24,250
He hit five of us.

3411
01:47:24,810 --> 01:47:25,650
Guys, I have...

3412
01:47:25,650 --> 01:47:26,330
I wonder how much he got there.

3413
01:47:27,050 --> 01:47:32,170
I haven't touched Rivals, like, a lot this week, so I already forgot about my frozen...

3414
01:47:32,170 --> 01:47:35,610
Like, the Ultron team up is the only team up that I keep forgetting I have.

3415
01:47:35,890 --> 01:47:36,470
What else wants to guess?

3416
01:47:38,950 --> 01:47:42,310
I touched Rivals, like, twice this week.

3417
01:47:42,590 --> 01:47:45,210
One was yesterday night, checking out everything.

3418
01:47:45,210 --> 01:47:47,250
And then, um...

3419
01:47:47,250 --> 01:47:49,150
And the other time was, like, warming up for this.

3420
01:47:49,730 --> 01:47:51,410
But, like, to be fair, I didn't feel threatened.

3421
01:47:51,630 --> 01:47:52,210
That's the thing.

3422
01:47:52,390 --> 01:47:54,830
I didn't feel threatened enough to, like, use it.

3423
01:47:56,010 --> 01:47:57,430
Did BP get changed at all?

3424
01:47:57,510 --> 01:47:58,610
He's exactly the same, right?

3425
01:47:59,310 --> 01:48:00,730
He's exactly the same, bro.

3426
01:48:00,790 --> 01:48:01,790
They do not like that character.

3427
01:48:03,370 --> 01:48:04,230
Now I like Jeff.

3428
01:48:16,660 --> 01:48:19,360
I feel bad for all the Jeff mains watching me play Jeff.

3429
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:21,960
I need a good Ultron game here, because my last one was...

3430
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:22,160
Whoa!

3431
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:23,320
That's where it goes!

3432
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:24,340
Not the greatest.

3433
01:48:25,020 --> 01:48:25,460
Wait, can I go back?

3434
01:48:25,620 --> 01:48:26,260
I can't go back.

3435
01:48:27,260 --> 01:48:27,780
You are what?

3436
01:48:28,180 --> 01:48:28,300
You are bad.

3437
01:48:28,300 --> 01:48:29,360
No, you are ass group.

3438
01:48:30,160 --> 01:48:30,700
It says you.

3439
01:48:35,900 --> 01:48:37,080
I forgot about it.

3440
01:48:37,080 --> 01:48:39,100
I think Jeff can be really good.

3441
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:40,260
But, in rank.

3442
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:41,220
In rank.

3443
01:48:41,260 --> 01:48:41,980
In rank high elo.

3444
01:48:42,460 --> 01:48:43,280
With a coordinated team.

3445
01:48:43,820 --> 01:48:46,000
We're not coordinated enough for Jeff at the moment.

3446
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:51,560
Like, if we're all stacked up, then I think Jeff will be really good.

3447
01:48:57,110 --> 01:48:58,530
Where is my torch, bro?

3448
01:49:01,270 --> 01:49:02,070
Yo, uh...

3449
01:49:02,070 --> 01:49:03,570
I spawned on the wrong side of the map or something.

3450
01:49:03,670 --> 01:49:04,010
I don't know.

3451
01:49:04,370 --> 01:49:05,430
I don't know.

3452
01:49:05,930 --> 01:49:07,350
You know, new map bugs.

3453
01:49:07,670 --> 01:49:08,610
All good, that happened.

3454
01:49:08,610 --> 01:49:09,410
It happens.

3455
01:49:09,630 --> 01:49:09,970
Eh.

3456
01:49:10,690 --> 01:49:11,490
Oh, good.

3457
01:49:11,770 --> 01:49:11,910
Oh!

3458
01:49:12,210 --> 01:49:12,830
Wait, you're still alive!

3459
01:49:13,210 --> 01:49:13,450
Nevermind.

3460
01:49:14,270 --> 01:49:15,970
Wait, Surecore is doing weird stuff back here.

3461
01:49:16,590 --> 01:49:17,770
He's always doing weird stuff.

3462
01:49:18,430 --> 01:49:19,050
Wait, he rezzed.

3463
01:49:19,130 --> 01:49:19,530
He's rezzing.

3464
01:49:19,910 --> 01:49:20,890
It was like a pink.

3465
01:49:20,890 --> 01:49:21,970
It was a pink thing right there.

3466
01:49:22,030 --> 01:49:23,410
I definitely was behind that wall.

3467
01:49:24,050 --> 01:49:24,530
He's dead.

3468
01:49:25,270 --> 01:49:25,410
Dead.

3469
01:49:26,150 --> 01:49:26,270
Wait.

3470
01:49:26,570 --> 01:49:26,870
What the fuck?

3471
01:49:28,050 --> 01:49:28,490
Handle it.

3472
01:49:28,670 --> 01:49:28,790
Dead.

3473
01:49:36,630 --> 01:49:38,110
I've got you guys.

3474
01:49:38,110 --> 01:49:38,450
Don't worry.

3475
01:49:38,570 --> 01:49:39,290
Don't worry.

3476
01:49:40,730 --> 01:49:41,330
He's one.

3477
01:49:41,510 --> 01:49:41,850
Oh.

3478
01:49:42,130 --> 01:49:42,650
He's so low.

3479
01:49:45,290 --> 01:49:46,630
I got snowflake on him too.

3480
01:49:47,590 --> 01:49:47,950
Overkill.

3481
01:49:51,570 --> 01:49:52,170
Oh, wait.

3482
01:49:52,250 --> 01:49:52,830
There's someone behind us.

3483
01:49:53,110 --> 01:49:53,590
Surecore is behind.

3484
01:49:54,010 --> 01:49:54,290
Hold on.

3485
01:49:54,290 --> 01:49:55,270
No, no, no, no, no.

3486
01:49:55,290 --> 01:49:55,670
It hurts.

3487
01:49:58,250 --> 01:49:59,190
Is he still behind?

3488
01:49:59,370 --> 01:49:59,710
He is.

3489
01:49:59,850 --> 01:50:00,670
Yes, I'm terrified.

3490
01:50:00,670 --> 01:50:01,290
Okay, later.

3491
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:03,230
Okay, dude.

3492
01:50:04,110 --> 01:50:06,650
Now, why is Surecore doing the Gilbert noodle right now?

3493
01:50:09,410 --> 01:50:10,450
That was crazy.

3494
01:50:10,870 --> 01:50:13,110
He did tweet out he was just gonna fling.

3495
01:50:13,970 --> 01:50:15,150
The entire time.

3496
01:50:16,110 --> 01:50:16,550
Insane.

3497
01:50:19,570 --> 01:50:20,190
Oh, wait.

3498
01:50:20,210 --> 01:50:20,570
There he is.

3499
01:50:20,650 --> 01:50:21,070
There he is.

3500
01:50:21,190 --> 01:50:21,510
There he is.

3501
01:50:21,590 --> 01:50:22,490
He's like right here.

3502
01:50:22,910 --> 01:50:23,730
There he is.

3503
01:50:23,870 --> 01:50:24,450
You got this.

3504
01:50:24,550 --> 01:50:25,210
Kuro, I believe.

3505
01:50:25,210 --> 01:50:25,790
He's not capable.

3506
01:50:25,970 --> 01:50:26,330
No, no, no.

3507
01:50:26,390 --> 01:50:26,770
No, no, no.

3508
01:50:26,830 --> 01:50:27,110
I believe.

3509
01:50:27,290 --> 01:50:27,970
You can win me on here.

3510
01:50:28,230 --> 01:50:28,450
Okay, okay.

3511
01:50:28,450 --> 01:50:28,870
I'm going back.

3512
01:50:28,910 --> 01:50:29,370
I believe.

3513
01:50:29,650 --> 01:50:30,670
I'll heal you through it.

3514
01:50:31,030 --> 01:50:31,950
Yeah, I'm really trying here.

3515
01:50:32,050 --> 01:50:32,550
I'm not gonna lie.

3516
01:50:37,150 --> 01:50:37,590
Oh, wait.

3517
01:50:37,670 --> 01:50:37,930
He missed.

3518
01:50:37,930 --> 01:50:38,330
I'm killing you guys.

3519
01:50:38,970 --> 01:50:41,650
I don't know if we're gonna make it through.

3520
01:50:45,580 --> 01:50:45,900
Alright.

3521
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:50,320
Oh, Necro's got that.

3522
01:50:50,760 --> 01:50:51,700
You got this, right?

3523
01:50:52,620 --> 01:50:55,380
If I go um yum, will I die instantly?

3524
01:50:56,580 --> 01:50:58,620
Oh, he fucking took the portal!

3525
01:50:58,880 --> 01:50:59,560
That's shitter!

3526
01:51:01,980 --> 01:51:04,260
I didn't even realize there was a portal there.

3527
01:51:05,380 --> 01:51:06,580
Oh, not the tank?

3528
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:08,580
I'll do it.

3529
01:51:09,220 --> 01:51:09,600
Yep.

3530
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:11,500
Maybe shooting at...

3531
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:12,460
I'm missing somehow?

3532
01:51:12,740 --> 01:51:14,520
I don't know if that's possible.

3533
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:19,500
Dude, call me crazy, but I feel like Ultron's left leg could be better.

3534
01:51:21,180 --> 01:51:21,780
You're bad.

3535
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:22,940
Really underwhelming.

3536
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:24,060
You are bad.

3537
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:24,900
Got you guys.

3538
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:31,860
I can't believe it.

3539
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:34,080
You're fine.

3540
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:35,680
I think.

3541
01:51:37,020 --> 01:51:38,220
You're not fine.

3542
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:38,600
Sorry.

3543
01:51:44,380 --> 01:51:44,900
Got me?

3544
01:51:46,440 --> 01:51:46,780
Giant.

3545
01:51:48,100 --> 01:51:49,440
Okay, I have to reload.

3546
01:51:49,980 --> 01:51:50,340
No!

3547
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:52,680
How did that pull me?

3548
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:53,120
That's crazy.

3549
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:54,420
That is a lot of damage.

3550
01:51:59,940 --> 01:52:00,300
Goodbye.

3551
01:52:05,650 --> 01:52:06,830
Ooh, the Wolverine.

3552
01:52:07,510 --> 01:52:07,870
Ooh.

3553
01:52:08,830 --> 01:52:09,470
That's smart.

3554
01:52:11,530 --> 01:52:12,630
Come on, I'm right here.

3555
01:52:14,110 --> 01:52:15,290
No, that's insane.

3556
01:52:15,510 --> 01:52:16,090
Hey, what did he do?

3557
01:52:16,230 --> 01:52:17,610
Why did he have to magle you like that?

3558
01:52:18,190 --> 01:52:19,210
Who did he do that?

3559
01:52:19,510 --> 01:52:19,870
Who did he do that?

3560
01:52:19,870 --> 01:52:22,770
Ron, I'll tell you, first of all, that was straight ping, all right?

3561
01:52:22,830 --> 01:52:26,070
He must be playing from Europe or something, because...

3562
01:52:26,070 --> 01:52:26,770
No, he is.

3563
01:52:26,910 --> 01:52:27,210
He's EU.

3564
01:52:28,190 --> 01:52:28,670
Oh, yeah.

3565
01:52:28,950 --> 01:52:30,730
Because I was behind that wall, but whatever.

3566
01:52:33,930 --> 01:52:34,250
Extermination!

3567
01:52:34,650 --> 01:52:35,830
Never thought I'd miss him.

3568
01:52:36,510 --> 01:52:36,830
What?

3569
01:52:37,530 --> 01:52:39,470
Yo, you CC him, you CC him, you can't come out.

3570
01:52:39,710 --> 01:52:41,390
Warlock's sniping me, Warlock's sniping me.

3571
01:52:41,490 --> 01:52:42,190
Where the fuck is Warlock?

3572
01:52:42,370 --> 01:52:42,610
I hate him.

3573
01:52:42,790 --> 01:52:43,010
I'm gonna fuck this up again.

3574
01:52:43,890 --> 01:52:44,790
I'm gonna try to beat here.

3575
01:52:44,950 --> 01:52:45,150
Sure.

3576
01:52:45,430 --> 01:52:46,710
Chat, tell me who Warlock is, bro.

3577
01:52:46,810 --> 01:52:46,990
What?

3578
01:52:48,010 --> 01:52:48,270
What?

3579
01:52:48,710 --> 01:52:49,290
Oh, yeah, yeah.

3580
01:52:49,650 --> 01:52:50,490
Cook him, cook him, cook him.

3581
01:52:51,270 --> 01:52:52,210
I've got enough of this.

3582
01:52:52,350 --> 01:52:53,390
Oh, no, he came back!

3583
01:52:53,890 --> 01:52:54,630
He came back!

3584
01:52:55,030 --> 01:52:59,810
Us, us, us, us, us, us, us, us, us, us.

3585
01:53:03,070 --> 01:53:04,170
Wait, I didn't do nothing.

3586
01:53:04,390 --> 01:53:05,050
I didn't do nothing.

3587
01:53:05,370 --> 01:53:05,610
Okay.

3588
01:53:05,830 --> 01:53:06,190
Oh.

3589
01:53:06,470 --> 01:53:07,030
Let's go.

3590
01:53:07,330 --> 01:53:09,250
I can't lose a group turn around.

3591
01:53:13,230 --> 01:53:13,870
I don't know.

3592
01:53:14,110 --> 01:53:14,990
Wait, where are you, Gru?

3593
01:53:15,170 --> 01:53:16,050
I'm following you.

3594
01:53:17,030 --> 01:53:18,390
I was following you!

3595
01:53:18,390 --> 01:53:19,630
Oh, the arch is getting closer.

3596
01:53:25,180 --> 01:53:26,480
This is so underwhelming.

3597
01:53:26,740 --> 01:53:27,620
Hey, Agent, give me a toss.

3598
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:30,000
Press C, press C, and then give me a toss.

3599
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:31,060
Wait.

3600
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:36,080
Oh, man.

3601
01:53:41,490 --> 01:53:42,170
There he is.

3602
01:53:42,170 --> 01:53:42,210
There he is.

3603
01:53:42,890 --> 01:53:43,910
Did I go through walls?

3604
01:53:44,050 --> 01:53:44,370
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3605
01:53:44,370 --> 01:53:45,290
Back, back, back, back, back.

3606
01:53:45,290 --> 01:53:45,390
Oh!

3607
01:53:53,350 --> 01:53:54,450
So many walls.

3608
01:53:54,770 --> 01:53:55,950
Wait, there's a...

3609
01:53:55,950 --> 01:53:57,250
Good heals, good heals.

3610
01:53:57,250 --> 01:53:58,590
There's a rocket just right there.

3611
01:53:59,970 --> 01:54:02,710
I can't out-damage the rocket heals, guys.

3612
01:54:05,610 --> 01:54:06,250
Here we go.

3613
01:54:06,450 --> 01:54:07,190
Agent, use the team up.

3614
01:54:08,830 --> 01:54:10,810
I out-damaged the rocket heals.

3615
01:54:10,910 --> 01:54:11,010
There we go.

3616
01:54:11,010 --> 01:54:11,390
Give me a toss.

3617
01:54:16,280 --> 01:54:17,140
Throw me, bro.

3618
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:18,680
There we go.

3619
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:19,500
Ooh!

3620
01:54:20,300 --> 01:54:21,400
Oh, nice!

3621
01:54:23,580 --> 01:54:25,160
Oh, there's a flanker, flanker!

3622
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:25,700
Nah.

3623
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:27,420
It's alright.

3624
01:54:30,540 --> 01:54:32,240
He's trying to go for me and he whiffed.

3625
01:54:32,680 --> 01:54:33,340
That's crazy.

3626
01:54:33,480 --> 01:54:34,640
I'm gonna try...

3627
01:54:34,640 --> 01:54:34,720
We'll pay.

3628
01:54:35,940 --> 01:54:36,760
I'm gonna try Loki.

3629
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:39,500
Wait, let's race bait Boger Guru.

3630
01:54:39,740 --> 01:54:39,980
Let's just go.

3631
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:40,800
Where's he at?

3632
01:54:40,940 --> 01:54:41,120
Where's he at?

3633
01:54:41,220 --> 01:54:41,320
Where's he at?

3634
01:54:41,320 --> 01:54:41,780
Where's he at?

3635
01:54:41,780 --> 01:54:42,180
I don't know.

3636
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:43,160
He's just running him.

3637
01:54:44,820 --> 01:54:45,720
He's main on the payload.

3638
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:46,700
Almost.

3639
01:54:49,100 --> 01:54:49,960
He's getting jungled!

3640
01:54:50,100 --> 01:54:50,580
Oh my god!

3641
01:54:51,020 --> 01:54:52,140
Wait, there's an Adam flanking?

3642
01:54:52,360 --> 01:54:53,160
Adam flanking again?

3643
01:54:53,400 --> 01:54:54,220
Kill him, kill him, kill him, kill him.

3644
01:54:54,260 --> 01:54:54,740
Melt him, melt him.

3645
01:54:56,140 --> 01:54:56,600
He's gone.

3646
01:54:58,960 --> 01:54:59,600
After reload.

3647
01:54:59,900 --> 01:55:00,260
Oh, no!

3648
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:00,900
Thank you.

3649
01:55:01,020 --> 01:55:02,980
Thank you.

3650
01:55:05,740 --> 01:55:06,940
Adam's still flanking, by the way.

3651
01:55:06,980 --> 01:55:07,660
Nice, Wolverine!

3652
01:55:08,100 --> 01:55:08,820
You like that?

3653
01:55:08,980 --> 01:55:09,560
Give me a toss.

3654
01:55:09,640 --> 01:55:09,960
Give me a toss.

3655
01:55:10,460 --> 01:55:11,880
I don't like the way you asked if I like that.

3656
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:12,240
Oh my god.

3657
01:55:12,980 --> 01:55:14,380
He's still up to behind us.

3658
01:55:15,140 --> 01:55:16,220
Is it not central enough?

3659
01:55:16,380 --> 01:55:16,640
Or what?

3660
01:55:18,160 --> 01:55:18,800
Oh my god.

3661
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:19,480
Toss me, toss me.

3662
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:20,880
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

3663
01:55:20,940 --> 01:55:21,740
I'm very low on health.

3664
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:23,500
Oh my god.

3665
01:55:23,860 --> 01:55:24,040
I'm dead.

3666
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:24,940
Yeah, yeah.

3667
01:55:25,080 --> 01:55:27,140
So, I'll be honest with you.

3668
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:32,880
They have to be focused on me, bro.

3669
01:55:33,080 --> 01:55:33,660
They have to be.

3670
01:55:33,820 --> 01:55:34,300
I'm a threat.

3671
01:55:34,580 --> 01:55:34,900
I'm a threat.

3672
01:55:35,120 --> 01:55:37,480
I'm a threat.

3673
01:55:37,480 --> 01:55:39,640
I just realized I didn't do my thing.

3674
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:40,960
Hello.

3675
01:55:41,380 --> 01:55:42,500
Oh, you just copied iron fist?

3676
01:55:42,820 --> 01:55:44,560
Yeah, I didn't have to, like, confirm thing.

3677
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:48,120
So, I instantly spammed.

3678
01:55:50,060 --> 01:55:50,940
I was like, whoops.

3679
01:55:50,940 --> 01:55:52,020
You're going crazy though, you're still alive.

3680
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:54,260
I don't know how to survive, but hello.

3681
01:55:55,660 --> 01:55:56,500
You actually live.

3682
01:55:56,540 --> 01:55:57,320
Hello, I'm back.

3683
01:55:58,440 --> 01:55:59,760
I need heals though.

3684
01:55:59,760 --> 01:55:59,840
They go.

3685
01:56:00,980 --> 01:56:02,340
Time to vanish.

3686
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:04,500
Oh, wow.

3687
01:56:04,580 --> 01:56:05,300
They're like waiting for me.

3688
01:56:05,640 --> 01:56:06,440
Oh, I'm fine.

3689
01:56:06,520 --> 01:56:07,240
Don't mind me.

3690
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:08,540
Hey, Mag.

3691
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:09,280
Mag on points.

3692
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:11,600
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

3693
01:56:11,600 --> 01:56:12,360
My death was pretty exaggerated.

3694
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:13,300
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3695
01:56:13,320 --> 01:56:14,060
Who's drawn?

3696
01:56:14,380 --> 01:56:14,520
Who?

3697
01:56:15,560 --> 01:56:16,100
Got you?

3698
01:56:18,620 --> 01:56:19,380
I'mma throw you.

3699
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:20,040
Yeah.

3700
01:56:20,240 --> 01:56:21,400
Oh, yeah.

3701
01:56:21,620 --> 01:56:22,520
I got somebody.

3702
01:56:23,180 --> 01:56:24,040
Oh, nice.

3703
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:24,940
You gobbled.

3704
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:26,160
Oh, unlucky.

3705
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:28,900
We're going in.

3706
01:56:31,300 --> 01:56:32,520
Oh, he's dead.

3707
01:56:34,260 --> 01:56:35,240
That's okay over there?

3708
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:35,980
Can't tell.

3709
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:37,300
Oh.

3710
01:56:37,300 --> 01:56:37,520
I don't know.

3711
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:37,880
I don't know.

3712
01:56:39,120 --> 01:56:39,600
Maybe?

3713
01:56:40,120 --> 01:56:40,540
Yeah, I'm okay.

3714
01:56:41,740 --> 01:56:42,340
Hi, Voros.

3715
01:56:42,660 --> 01:56:43,200
We'll be farmed.

3716
01:56:45,460 --> 01:56:46,620
Time to vanish.

3717
01:56:48,180 --> 01:56:48,460
Nice.

3718
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:50,160
Don't give them another inch.

3719
01:56:50,740 --> 01:56:51,280
Or else.

3720
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:52,580
Better start that vehicle.

3721
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:53,940
Oh.

3722
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:55,800
There you go.

3723
01:56:56,480 --> 01:56:56,920
There is.

3724
01:56:56,920 --> 01:56:57,780
You went for me with that.

3725
01:56:57,780 --> 01:57:00,080
He's going to fight for that one.

3726
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:00,820
Oh, okay.

3727
01:57:01,740 --> 01:57:02,860
Oh, my God.

3728
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:05,320
Wait, no, no, no.

3729
01:57:05,320 --> 01:57:05,980
Did we just see nine?

3730
01:57:06,040 --> 01:57:07,100
Oh, we just see nine.

3731
01:57:07,780 --> 01:57:08,800
Guys, did we see nine?

3732
01:57:09,020 --> 01:57:09,600
Did we just see nine?

3733
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:12,140
We might have seen nine for half the point, bro.

3734
01:57:13,060 --> 01:57:13,200
What?

3735
01:57:13,620 --> 01:57:14,080
That's nice.

3736
01:57:15,140 --> 01:57:16,220
Oh, my God.

3737
01:57:17,260 --> 01:57:18,440
Who's seen nine us?

3738
01:57:21,380 --> 01:57:22,300
Who's job is it?

3739
01:57:22,680 --> 01:57:24,340
Guys, it was content, right?

3740
01:57:25,180 --> 01:57:26,180
Yeah, it's probably my fault.

3741
01:57:26,180 --> 01:57:28,320
Yeah, we're doing it for content, right, guys?

3742
01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:29,300
Yeah.

3743
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:30,800
Holy shit.

3744
01:57:31,860 --> 01:57:32,540
Do we go another, guys?

3745
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:33,960
I'm down.

3746
01:57:34,040 --> 01:57:35,020
I don't know if I can handle another.

3747
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:36,560
Yeah, it was kind of intense.

3748
01:57:37,160 --> 01:57:37,860
Yeah, my back hurt.

3749
01:57:38,100 --> 01:57:38,940
Let's do another though.

3750
01:57:40,020 --> 01:57:40,280
All right.

3751
01:57:42,900 --> 01:57:43,840
Oh, that was something.

3752
01:57:44,240 --> 01:57:44,900
That's unreal.

3753
01:57:44,900 --> 01:57:46,980
Wait, was it sure for that C9 us?

3754
01:57:47,380 --> 01:57:47,880
Oh, my God.

3755
01:57:51,460 --> 01:57:53,780
That is crazy going for C9s in this.

3756
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:56,060
Yeah, the XC9s.

3757
01:57:56,340 --> 01:57:56,940
C9s us.

3758
01:57:57,860 --> 01:57:58,420
Crazy.

3759
01:58:04,280 --> 01:58:05,400
I'll play...

3760
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:14,520
Star-Lord.

3761
01:58:14,700 --> 01:58:15,440
Oh, the team up.

3762
01:58:16,620 --> 01:58:17,400
How's the team up?

3763
01:58:17,400 --> 01:58:17,940
Yeah, the team up is...

3764
01:58:17,940 --> 01:58:18,740
Star-Lord.

3765
01:58:18,760 --> 01:58:19,420
It's really good.

3766
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:21,020
It seems like a necessity, to be honest.

3767
01:58:21,320 --> 01:58:21,960
Oh, all right.

3768
01:58:22,200 --> 01:58:24,540
I guess because, like, he'll have another form to heal, too.

3769
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:27,840
Because I think he lacks the heals without it.

3770
01:58:33,900 --> 01:58:35,880
Yeah, this would be my last game, guys.

3771
01:58:36,060 --> 01:58:40,900
And then I gotta go to the tech check for a meet and greet.

3772
01:58:41,560 --> 01:58:42,400
For Fanime.

3773
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:44,160
It's a busy day.

3774
01:58:46,440 --> 01:58:48,660
Oh, you guys have been enjoying the preview.

3775
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:50,260
And everything.

3776
01:58:51,060 --> 01:58:52,320
But I've been doing all right.

3777
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:53,300
I might be talking too much.

3778
01:58:53,300 --> 01:58:55,160
I will say, I'm liking this patch a lot more.

3779
01:58:55,760 --> 01:58:56,340
Oh, yeah.

3780
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:57,220
Yeah, previous one.

3781
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:58,380
Oh, yeah.

3782
01:58:58,940 --> 01:59:01,020
As a dive player, I don't know if I like this patch.

3783
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:02,160
It's also awesome, though.

3784
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:05,480
As a support player, I love this patch.

3785
01:59:11,140 --> 01:59:12,340
Oh, there's...

3786
01:59:12,340 --> 01:59:13,360
Oh, there's...

3787
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:13,880
There's a nice world, bro.

3788
01:59:23,590 --> 01:59:24,730
Oh, you're in triple?

3789
01:59:28,310 --> 01:59:28,910
Uh...

3790
01:59:28,910 --> 01:59:29,410
Yup, they are.

3791
01:59:29,570 --> 01:59:29,830
Yeah.

3792
01:59:30,090 --> 01:59:30,950
Cause I see...

3793
01:59:30,950 --> 01:59:33,270
I see Mantis.

3794
01:59:34,110 --> 01:59:34,650
Oh!

3795
01:59:36,130 --> 01:59:36,730
Ready?

3796
01:59:40,190 --> 01:59:41,150
How'd you get it?

3797
01:59:41,650 --> 01:59:42,450
That was fast.

3798
01:59:42,570 --> 01:59:43,030
I could do that.

3799
01:59:43,270 --> 01:59:48,530
Oh, I can't get to you, Gru.

3800
01:59:55,010 --> 01:59:55,370
Nice.

3801
01:59:58,130 --> 01:59:59,310
Wait, I hear a portal.

3802
01:59:59,570 --> 02:00:00,130
Oh, that was you.

3803
02:00:00,270 --> 02:00:00,410
Okay.

3804
02:00:01,910 --> 02:00:03,270
I was like, whose portal is that?

3805
02:00:03,890 --> 02:00:04,910
Wait, can I get out from here?

3806
02:00:07,730 --> 02:00:08,790
He's behind us.

3807
02:00:08,790 --> 02:00:09,570
Wait, who is?

3808
02:00:10,550 --> 02:00:11,330
There's a Gru behind us.

3809
02:00:11,510 --> 02:00:11,990
Oh.

3810
02:00:11,990 --> 02:00:12,490
Yeah, he is.

3811
02:00:15,330 --> 02:00:16,150
Oh, unlucky.

3812
02:00:23,340 --> 02:00:24,100
Wait, he's low.

3813
02:00:24,200 --> 02:00:24,740
The floor is low.

3814
02:00:31,180 --> 02:00:31,900
Oh, no.

3815
02:00:33,360 --> 02:00:33,720
Copy.

3816
02:00:36,760 --> 02:00:37,240
No.

3817
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:50,680
Don't call me over.

3818
02:00:53,060 --> 02:00:53,780
I'm leaving.

3819
02:00:55,600 --> 02:00:56,040
I'm leaving.

3820
02:00:56,260 --> 02:00:57,420
Have you used the team up yet?

3821
02:00:58,180 --> 02:00:58,720
Yeah, I did.

3822
02:00:58,860 --> 02:00:59,040
I did.

3823
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:01,500
I like the heels for it.

3824
02:01:05,740 --> 02:01:06,460
Oh my...

3825
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:12,560
Nice.

3826
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:14,520
Oh.

3827
02:01:15,400 --> 02:01:15,840
Nice.

3828
02:01:17,140 --> 02:01:17,580
Oh.

3829
02:01:19,860 --> 02:01:20,540
Holy shit.

3830
02:01:20,740 --> 02:01:21,060
Oh, I'm...

3831
02:01:21,060 --> 02:01:21,980
Oh, I'm so close.

3832
02:01:23,940 --> 02:01:24,980
I shot you my screen.

3833
02:01:25,140 --> 02:01:25,800
It's probably ping.

3834
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:27,920
Wait, I think it's just ping.

3835
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:30,620
Yeah, mine's like 130.

3836
02:01:31,160 --> 02:01:31,460
Kinda high.

3837
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:37,480
Nice.

3838
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:39,340
Wait, there's a Skrogo behind us.

3839
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:39,760
Yeah.

3840
02:01:41,620 --> 02:01:43,860
There you go.

3841
02:01:43,940 --> 02:01:47,180
There you go.

3842
02:01:47,380 --> 02:01:49,020
I'm just like, on the low ground, guys.

3843
02:01:49,220 --> 02:01:49,320
Main.

3844
02:01:50,540 --> 02:01:50,860
Oh my god.

3845
02:01:51,120 --> 02:01:51,480
Do you guys?

3846
02:01:52,720 --> 02:01:53,060
No.

3847
02:01:53,900 --> 02:01:54,300
Fuck.

3848
02:01:59,720 --> 02:02:00,120
Jesus.

3849
02:02:06,220 --> 02:02:08,840
Oh my god, you guys are taking so much damage.

3850
02:02:08,840 --> 02:02:10,020
Yeah, I'm trying to heal him.

3851
02:02:10,700 --> 02:02:11,380
So much damage.

3852
02:02:11,940 --> 02:02:12,120
Yeah.

3853
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:15,380
I think I need this.

3854
02:02:16,180 --> 02:02:16,580
No.

3855
02:02:16,900 --> 02:02:17,580
He's just one.

3856
02:02:17,800 --> 02:02:19,140
The parking transport's so fucking hard.

3857
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:19,920
No!

3858
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:21,540
Okay.

3859
02:02:22,420 --> 02:02:22,680
I got you.

3860
02:02:22,680 --> 02:02:23,620
It's like we're playing a pro team.

3861
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:24,540
This is crazy.

3862
02:02:26,100 --> 02:02:27,060
I'm gonna copy...

3863
02:02:27,060 --> 02:02:28,540
Just like, make sure it doesn't die.

3864
02:02:31,720 --> 02:02:32,980
Oh, I might need...

3865
02:02:33,820 --> 02:02:34,580
I got you.

3866
02:02:34,580 --> 02:02:34,920
I'm holding.

3867
02:02:36,020 --> 02:02:36,480
Don't worry.

3868
02:02:36,600 --> 02:02:37,080
You got your...

3869
02:02:37,080 --> 02:02:37,560
You got his?

3870
02:02:39,460 --> 02:02:39,800
Uh...

3871
02:02:39,800 --> 02:02:39,920
Yup.

3872
02:02:40,160 --> 02:02:40,440
There you go.

3873
02:02:41,800 --> 02:02:42,140
Okay.

3874
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:44,860
Nice.

3875
02:02:44,940 --> 02:02:45,080
Nice.

3876
02:02:45,220 --> 02:02:45,440
Oh my god.

3877
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:46,280
Oh!

3878
02:02:51,100 --> 02:02:51,440
Oh!

3879
02:02:52,160 --> 02:02:52,300
Yeah.

3880
02:02:54,160 --> 02:02:54,480
Thank you.

3881
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:55,100
I'm on point.

3882
02:02:55,480 --> 02:02:55,800
Let's go.

3883
02:02:56,700 --> 02:02:58,040
Oh, you can be on point, actually.

3884
02:02:58,640 --> 02:02:59,380
Yeah, I'm on point.

3885
02:02:59,380 --> 02:02:59,840
Yeah.

3886
02:02:59,940 --> 02:03:01,500
Only 60 seconds left.

3887
02:03:06,210 --> 02:03:06,480
Extermination!

3888
02:03:11,630 --> 02:03:12,710
Oh my god.

3889
02:03:12,950 --> 02:03:13,570
Did they griddle?

3890
02:03:13,910 --> 02:03:14,590
You're good, you're good.

3891
02:03:16,350 --> 02:03:17,730
You just exterminate.

3892
02:03:19,850 --> 02:03:20,710
Ultra on top left.

3893
02:03:22,110 --> 02:03:22,730
He's low, he's low.

3894
02:03:23,010 --> 02:03:23,470
Ultra low.

3895
02:03:23,950 --> 02:03:24,070
Wow.

3896
02:03:26,490 --> 02:03:27,190
Got you.

3897
02:03:29,330 --> 02:03:29,990
Or low.

3898
02:03:30,010 --> 02:03:30,610
Or low top left.

3899
02:03:31,830 --> 02:03:33,310
Yeah, we're getting flanked.

3900
02:03:34,230 --> 02:03:35,270
Yup, they're kinda everywhere.

3901
02:03:37,510 --> 02:03:39,090
Wait, I'm getting shot by...

3902
02:03:39,090 --> 02:03:39,170
Oh!

3903
02:03:40,170 --> 02:03:41,330
I didn't see the squirrel, bro.

3904
02:03:42,110 --> 02:03:42,730
Touching 20.

3905
02:03:44,130 --> 02:03:44,750
Yeah, we're good, we're good.

3906
02:03:44,830 --> 02:03:45,930
Guys, lock it in, lock it in.

3907
02:03:48,470 --> 02:03:49,970
I'm coming back soon.

3908
02:03:50,370 --> 02:03:51,530
Don't worry, I'm at my C.

3909
02:03:56,100 --> 02:03:56,700
Nice, Ray.

3910
02:03:58,860 --> 02:03:59,500
To the screws.

3911
02:04:00,040 --> 02:04:00,300
Got him.

3912
02:04:00,900 --> 02:04:01,820
Oh, I'm one, I'm one.

3913
02:04:01,820 --> 02:04:03,160
Keep fighting until we have a winner.

3914
02:04:06,070 --> 02:04:07,070
I got alternate.

3915
02:04:07,410 --> 02:04:07,790
Nice.

3916
02:04:09,870 --> 02:04:10,490
Let's go.

3917
02:04:10,930 --> 02:04:11,370
Yay!

3918
02:04:15,850 --> 02:04:16,810
Oh, whoops.

3919
02:04:21,530 --> 02:04:22,390
I'll try...

3920
02:04:22,390 --> 02:04:24,670
Oh my god, you're so hard to hit on that hero.

3921
02:04:24,830 --> 02:04:25,110
What the hell?

3922
02:04:25,530 --> 02:04:26,790
You're doing crazy moves in Star Lord.

3923
02:04:26,790 --> 02:04:28,370
Oh, now Chris, can you heal me real quick?

3924
02:04:29,150 --> 02:04:29,430
Okay.

3925
02:04:29,750 --> 02:04:30,570
Oh, yeah.

3926
02:04:30,730 --> 02:04:30,950
Thanks.

3927
02:04:34,110 --> 02:04:34,790
Should I be the...

3928
02:04:34,790 --> 02:04:35,290
Oh, ready to heal.

3929
02:04:35,510 --> 02:04:35,930
You know what?

3930
02:04:35,930 --> 02:04:37,310
You should probably be the payload, Princess.

3931
02:04:37,470 --> 02:04:38,070
You have your ult.

3932
02:04:38,290 --> 02:04:39,210
Yeah, that's true.

3933
02:04:39,910 --> 02:04:40,650
Oh my god!

3934
02:04:41,050 --> 02:04:41,370
Oh!

3935
02:04:41,690 --> 02:04:42,350
It knocked me out!

3936
02:04:42,390 --> 02:04:43,010
They locked me out!

3937
02:04:44,950 --> 02:04:45,570
I'm okay, I'm okay.

3938
02:04:45,570 --> 02:04:45,930
I'm okay, I'm okay.

3939
02:04:46,370 --> 02:04:47,410
Yeah, I'll be on payload.

3940
02:04:47,590 --> 02:04:47,690
Fire!

3941
02:04:49,770 --> 02:04:50,230
He's in there!

3942
02:04:50,810 --> 02:04:50,970
He's in there.

3943
02:04:51,850 --> 02:04:53,690
We are undefeatable!

3944
02:04:54,630 --> 02:04:55,690
Slow, Boker, slow!

3945
02:05:00,970 --> 02:05:02,630
Oh, I couldn't get too bad.

3946
02:05:09,690 --> 02:05:10,330
I'm okay.

3947
02:05:11,350 --> 02:05:13,610
I must fight my programming and assist the audience.

3948
02:05:13,730 --> 02:05:14,850
Like, what the fuck is the group doing up here?

3949
02:05:16,570 --> 02:05:17,030
Extroviral!

3950
02:05:18,050 --> 02:05:18,790
Did he do that?

3951
02:05:18,790 --> 02:05:19,170
I'm not.

3952
02:05:20,310 --> 02:05:21,250
But he missed.

3953
02:05:31,680 --> 02:05:32,560
We're so low.

3954
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:34,980
Holy shit.

3955
02:05:35,200 --> 02:05:35,660
Wait.

3956
02:05:40,460 --> 02:05:40,960
Oh, clip.

3957
02:05:41,440 --> 02:05:42,380
It's clip time.

3958
02:05:47,800 --> 02:05:48,640
Oh, can you heal me?

3959
02:05:49,860 --> 02:05:50,600
Uh, yeah.

3960
02:05:50,600 --> 02:05:51,120
Thank you.

3961
02:05:52,200 --> 02:05:54,020
It's been hard to hit a flying hero.

3962
02:05:54,460 --> 02:05:54,620
Yeah.

3963
02:05:55,040 --> 02:05:55,380
I got you.

3964
02:05:56,940 --> 02:05:58,880
Wait, why the hell, uh, oh my god.

3965
02:05:59,440 --> 02:06:00,200
Didn't need this one.

3966
02:06:01,940 --> 02:06:02,600
I bolt.

3967
02:06:03,220 --> 02:06:03,360
Hello.

3968
02:06:03,820 --> 02:06:04,260
Yo.

3969
02:06:05,060 --> 02:06:05,920
My vulgar is low.

3970
02:06:07,100 --> 02:06:07,500
You okay.

3971
02:06:13,640 --> 02:06:14,080
Thanks.

3972
02:06:14,600 --> 02:06:14,860
Do your trick.

3973
02:06:17,940 --> 02:06:18,380
Bye.

3974
02:06:23,150 --> 02:06:23,590
Yes.

3975
02:06:24,230 --> 02:06:25,510
Alright, let's pop up quick for a portal.

3976
02:06:27,810 --> 02:06:28,330
Hey.

3977
02:06:28,870 --> 02:06:30,310
Are you gonna do a crazy portal?

3978
02:06:30,970 --> 02:06:31,410
Maybe.

3979
02:06:31,930 --> 02:06:34,210
I wonder what that initial portal was.

3980
02:06:34,630 --> 02:06:34,710
Oh.

3981
02:06:34,990 --> 02:06:36,070
What kind of clip he was trying to get.

3982
02:06:38,250 --> 02:06:39,250
Wait, someone above.

3983
02:06:39,650 --> 02:06:39,790
Hello?

3984
02:06:43,250 --> 02:06:44,550
Oh, oh.

3985
02:06:45,170 --> 02:06:49,010
Not the best.

3986
02:06:49,010 --> 02:06:50,130
What is this?

3987
02:06:50,570 --> 02:06:51,750
He's behind him.

3988
02:06:52,050 --> 02:06:52,290
Yeah, yeah.

3989
02:06:53,730 --> 02:06:54,350
I might.

3990
02:06:54,870 --> 02:06:55,710
Oh, I'm so low.

3991
02:06:57,810 --> 02:06:58,410
Big.

3992
02:06:59,490 --> 02:07:00,470
Oh, nice.

3993
02:07:02,810 --> 02:07:03,630
Thumbs one.

3994
02:07:06,530 --> 02:07:06,970
Okay.

3995
02:07:06,970 --> 02:07:07,530
I'm coming on me.

3996
02:07:07,970 --> 02:07:08,410
Okay.

3997
02:07:09,110 --> 02:07:10,110
Wait, he swung over here.

3998
02:07:12,530 --> 02:07:13,090
It's okay.

3999
02:07:13,270 --> 02:07:14,270
He doesn't know I can fly.

4000
02:07:15,110 --> 02:07:15,910
What the hell?

4001
02:07:18,050 --> 02:07:19,750
Okay, that was... weird.

4002
02:07:19,750 --> 02:07:20,030
That is...

4003
02:07:20,030 --> 02:07:21,590
That is something.

4004
02:07:22,450 --> 02:07:23,590
That is...

4005
02:07:23,590 --> 02:07:25,090
That is something.

4006
02:07:25,930 --> 02:07:26,950
Good luck.

4007
02:07:31,010 --> 02:07:32,070
Oh, no.

4008
02:07:32,410 --> 02:07:32,970
Oh, no.

4009
02:07:32,970 --> 02:07:33,290
Oh, no.

4010
02:07:33,650 --> 02:07:34,490
I'm so dead.

4011
02:07:34,670 --> 02:07:35,430
I'm so dead.

4012
02:07:37,330 --> 02:07:37,970
Oh, that's big.

4013
02:07:38,090 --> 02:07:38,290
That's big.

4014
02:07:38,390 --> 02:07:38,790
That's real big.

4015
02:07:39,430 --> 02:07:40,210
Oh, my God.

4016
02:07:40,390 --> 02:07:40,830
That was bad.

4017
02:07:40,890 --> 02:07:41,070
Oh, nice.

4018
02:07:41,250 --> 02:07:41,650
That's Groodle.

4019
02:07:42,630 --> 02:07:43,270
Crazy Groodle.

4020
02:07:48,680 --> 02:07:49,660
Wait, who's over here?

4021
02:07:49,980 --> 02:07:50,260
Oh, yo.

4022
02:07:50,640 --> 02:07:51,040
I got you.

4023
02:07:51,300 --> 02:07:51,500
Get the Venom.

4024
02:07:53,340 --> 02:07:54,440
There's an Atron right here.

4025
02:07:54,520 --> 02:07:54,820
One more clean fight.

4026
02:07:54,840 --> 02:07:55,600
We need one more clean fight.

4027
02:07:55,600 --> 02:07:55,660
We need one more clean fight.

4028
02:07:56,400 --> 02:07:57,420
Can we kill the staggers?

4029
02:07:58,380 --> 02:07:58,680
Yeah, yeah.

4030
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:01,760
That's big, that's big.

4031
02:08:01,760 --> 02:08:01,920
I got you.

4032
02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:02,280
Oh.

4033
02:08:03,580 --> 02:08:04,340
Yeah, hello top.

4034
02:08:09,010 --> 02:08:09,290
Nice.

4035
02:08:09,510 --> 02:08:10,610
Only 60 seconds left.

4036
02:08:11,650 --> 02:08:12,230
I'm healing you on point.

4037
02:08:12,670 --> 02:08:13,210
I have a good spot here.

4038
02:08:13,610 --> 02:08:13,710
Actually.

4039
02:08:14,970 --> 02:08:15,730
Wait, Bulger low?

4040
02:08:15,950 --> 02:08:16,150
Nice.

4041
02:08:17,570 --> 02:08:17,850
Yay!

4042
02:08:19,870 --> 02:08:20,430
Chee-chees!

4043
02:08:20,850 --> 02:08:21,130
Let's go.

4044
02:08:21,130 --> 02:08:21,530
We're too clean, team.

4045
02:08:21,690 --> 02:08:22,110
We're too clean.

4046
02:08:23,610 --> 02:08:24,170
Chee-chees.

4047
02:08:25,670 --> 02:08:26,190
We're the ghosts.

4048
02:08:26,230 --> 02:08:27,110
We might be the best to ever.

4049
02:08:27,250 --> 02:08:28,370
We might be the best to ever do it.

4050
02:08:28,790 --> 02:08:29,070
True.

4051
02:08:29,450 --> 02:08:29,890
Actually, man.

4052
02:08:29,930 --> 02:08:30,410
The best to ever do it.

4053
02:08:30,550 --> 02:08:30,790
What is that?

4054
02:08:30,970 --> 02:08:31,270
Three in a row?

4055
02:08:31,270 --> 02:08:31,910
Oh, no.

4056
02:08:32,110 --> 02:08:33,270
We see nine last game.

4057
02:08:33,390 --> 02:08:33,670
That don't count.

4058
02:08:33,850 --> 02:08:34,190
That don't count.

4059
02:08:34,770 --> 02:08:37,930
I mean, it's like half a win because we were keeping them in spawn.

4060
02:08:38,190 --> 02:08:38,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4061
02:08:39,090 --> 02:08:39,390
You know what I mean?

4062
02:08:39,390 --> 02:08:42,210
We're just having so much fun killing them that we didn't notice.

4063
02:08:42,550 --> 02:08:42,570
True.

4064
02:08:43,490 --> 02:08:43,730
Yes.

4065
02:08:46,410 --> 02:08:47,270
Damn, it's already...

4066
02:08:47,270 --> 02:08:48,190
It's already seven.

4067
02:08:48,370 --> 02:08:48,790
Time flew.

4068
02:08:48,990 --> 02:08:49,310
Yeah.

4069
02:08:49,770 --> 02:08:50,810
Yeah, it's fun as hell.

4070
02:08:51,210 --> 02:08:53,050
Time flies and you're having fun, am I right?

4071
02:08:54,690 --> 02:08:55,610
You sure are, man.

4072
02:08:55,650 --> 02:08:57,010
It was good playing with y'all though, for real.

4073
02:08:57,510 --> 02:08:57,730
Yeah.

4074
02:08:58,210 --> 02:08:58,690
Chee-chees, guys.

4075
02:08:59,090 --> 02:09:00,510
Chee-chees, great play with all of you.

4076
02:09:01,230 --> 02:09:02,170
Chee-chees, everybody.

4077
02:09:02,730 --> 02:09:03,490
Chee-chees, guys.

4078
02:09:03,950 --> 02:09:04,630
Chee-chees.

4079
02:09:05,270 --> 02:09:05,510
Chee-chees.

4080
02:09:06,330 --> 02:09:06,770
All right, y'all.

4081
02:09:07,050 --> 02:09:07,770
All right, bye-bye.

4082
02:09:08,070 --> 02:09:08,870
See y'all on ranked.

4083
02:09:09,110 --> 02:09:09,570
See y'all on ranked.

4084
02:09:09,730 --> 02:09:09,850
Yeah.

4085
02:09:10,210 --> 02:09:10,250
Oh, yeah.

4086
02:09:10,870 --> 02:09:11,570
True, true.

4087
02:09:11,870 --> 02:09:12,230
Peace.

4088
02:09:13,470 --> 02:09:13,690
Peace.

4089
02:09:15,690 --> 02:09:17,050
All right, that was fun.

4090
02:09:17,310 --> 02:09:22,070
I had a fun time checking out the new, um, checking out the new updates and everything.

4091
02:09:22,430 --> 02:09:22,550
Oh.

4092
02:09:23,170 --> 02:09:23,930
He knows.

4093
02:09:23,990 --> 02:09:26,330
It's almost feeding time, but like, we're one hour away.

4094
02:09:28,210 --> 02:09:30,290
Yeah, I had really fun playing Ultron.

4095
02:09:30,710 --> 02:09:32,390
Jeff was like, okay, no.

4096
02:09:33,050 --> 02:09:33,450
No.

4097
02:09:33,770 --> 02:09:34,470
You see this?

4098
02:09:34,690 --> 02:09:35,290
Wait, where is it?

4099
02:09:36,010 --> 02:09:36,190
Okay.

4100
02:09:36,790 --> 02:09:37,370
Dad, no.

4101
02:09:37,550 --> 02:09:37,750
Sorry.

4102
02:09:37,930 --> 02:09:39,130
He knows that I'm about to end.

4103
02:09:39,330 --> 02:09:40,690
So he's like, that means feeding time.

4104
02:09:40,690 --> 02:09:44,250
Usually it's not, because I had, um, he's like an hour behind.

4105
02:09:47,390 --> 02:09:49,990
I think, I think Jeff is actually good.

4106
02:09:49,990 --> 02:09:53,070
I just think like, you need a coordinated team to play Jeff.

4107
02:09:53,430 --> 02:09:56,610
Um, because like, the Storm-Jeff combo is really, really strong.

4108
02:09:56,950 --> 02:10:06,430
I was just like, I don't have a lot of playtime on Jeff, but he's, I just think if I have more playtime on- Jeff is literally the only character I lack playtime on for all the strategists.

4109
02:10:06,590 --> 02:10:09,630
And I feel like I play Ultron better than Jeff.

4110
02:10:12,630 --> 02:10:17,550
When I was trying Jeff, I was like, wait, I think I personally play better on Ultron than Jeff.

4111
02:10:17,810 --> 02:10:21,330
Like, I think I was actually playing really well on Ultron.

4112
02:10:21,730 --> 02:10:24,410
Like, cause like, I don't know.

4113
02:10:24,630 --> 02:10:25,350
Jeff is weird.

4114
02:10:25,590 --> 02:10:32,490
He's had such a weird mechanic that it's very, um, hard to like, process it correctly.

4115
02:10:32,550 --> 02:10:36,050
Cause his mechanic-wise, his gameplay-wise is very weird.

4116
02:10:37,870 --> 02:10:38,270
Uh...

4117
02:10:39,450 --> 02:10:41,770
But I think my Ultron was pretty decent.

4118
02:10:43,510 --> 02:10:44,310
And, um...

4119
02:10:44,310 --> 02:10:45,990
And, um...

4120
02:10:45,990 --> 02:10:47,470
I, I think like...

4121
02:10:47,470 --> 02:10:52,510
Yeah, and with Jeff, you need a lot of map knowledge so you can fly- You can like, swim up walls and everything.

4122
02:10:52,670 --> 02:10:54,850
I think it's just swimming up walls that throws me off too.

4123
02:10:56,470 --> 02:10:56,950
Um...

4124
02:10:56,950 --> 02:10:57,690
Um...

4125
02:10:57,690 --> 02:10:58,850
Yeah, um...

4126
02:10:59,450 --> 02:11:02,330
But like, I think like, uh...

4127
02:11:02,650 --> 02:11:04,510
I think I just need map knowledge for Jeff.

4128
02:11:04,670 --> 02:11:06,710
And I, that map took a while to process.

4129
02:11:06,910 --> 02:11:08,250
I don't know where the portals go.

4130
02:11:08,450 --> 02:11:11,890
And like, where everybody is when I was playing Jeff.

4131
02:11:11,890 --> 02:11:14,930
And like, you need map knowledge and a coordinate team.

4132
02:11:15,050 --> 02:11:17,750
I think he can be really scary and high elo and competitive.

4133
02:11:18,290 --> 02:11:19,490
Especially for Stormlight.

4134
02:11:19,690 --> 02:11:20,730
But it was really fun.

4135
02:11:20,890 --> 02:11:23,850
It was really fun checking out the entire new update and everything.

4136
02:11:23,990 --> 02:11:25,870
It's like Krakoa all over.

4137
02:11:25,950 --> 02:11:26,510
But this is...

4138
02:11:26,510 --> 02:11:27,470
It's the worst.

4139
02:11:27,670 --> 02:11:30,170
Cause like, it's all metal and gray.

4140
02:11:30,490 --> 02:11:33,950
So I was like, at least I could use trees and be like, there it is.

4141
02:11:33,950 --> 02:11:35,470
Cause that's where I had to go next.

4142
02:11:35,770 --> 02:11:38,770
So it takes a while for me to build up the map knowledge.

4143
02:11:38,930 --> 02:11:39,750
But I still had it really fun.

4144
02:11:39,810 --> 02:11:41,850
When I started figuring out the map.

4145
02:11:42,010 --> 02:11:44,310
It started getting easier and easier for me.

4146
02:11:44,470 --> 02:11:46,210
And then I started figuring out stuff.

4147
02:11:47,170 --> 02:11:47,610
Um...

4148
02:11:47,610 --> 02:11:48,810
And, um...

4149
02:11:48,810 --> 02:11:50,170
I think I did pretty well.

4150
02:11:50,650 --> 02:11:51,090
Um...

4151
02:11:51,090 --> 02:11:53,270
I hope I didn't talk too much.

4152
02:11:53,370 --> 02:11:54,710
Cause I realized I was talking a lot.

4153
02:11:54,790 --> 02:11:55,730
And I was like, oh...

4154
02:11:57,450 --> 02:12:00,070
I feel like everybody was talking to their own chat.

4155
02:12:00,310 --> 02:12:01,170
And I was stupid.

4156
02:12:01,370 --> 02:12:02,590
I was trying to talk to them.

4157
02:12:02,590 --> 02:12:05,090
And I was like, oh, I hope I didn't talk too much.

4158
02:12:05,270 --> 02:12:05,910
Sorry guys.

4159
02:12:06,390 --> 02:12:06,770
I...

4160
02:12:11,930 --> 02:12:12,830
I was like, wait.

4161
02:12:12,990 --> 02:12:14,970
Am I supposed to talk to my chat too?

4162
02:12:15,490 --> 02:12:15,930
I...

4163
02:12:22,950 --> 02:12:23,870
Yeah, but...

4164
02:12:23,870 --> 02:12:25,290
It was really, really fun.

4165
02:12:25,470 --> 02:12:27,250
Cause I was like, Necros, I got you.

4166
02:12:27,450 --> 02:12:28,230
No response.

4167
02:12:28,490 --> 02:12:29,490
I was like, it's alright.

4168
02:12:31,150 --> 02:12:31,990
That's cool.

4169
02:12:35,490 --> 02:12:37,650
Just know you're alive because of me.

4170
02:12:38,090 --> 02:12:38,950
Just know that.

4171
02:12:47,230 --> 02:12:47,630
Um...

4172
02:12:47,630 --> 02:12:48,870
Yeah, and then...

4173
02:12:48,870 --> 02:12:49,670
But I had a lot of fun.

4174
02:12:49,730 --> 02:12:50,530
It was a great opportunity.

4175
02:12:50,630 --> 02:12:52,230

Or do...

4180
02:12:56,850 --> 02:12:57,750
Do I have a command for it?

4181
02:12:57,750 --> 02:12:58,830
I don't think I have a command for it.

4182
02:12:59,050 --> 02:12:59,170
Haha.

4183
02:12:59,550 --> 02:12:59,990
But...

4184
02:13:01,110 --> 02:13:01,550
Um...

4185
02:13:01,550 --> 02:13:02,110
Um...

4186
02:13:02,110 --> 02:13:03,090
But it was really fun.

4187
02:13:03,250 --> 02:13:04,810
And I really enjoyed having...

4188
02:13:04,810 --> 02:13:06,850
Being able to check out the other access.

4189
02:13:07,070 --> 02:13:09,090
Being invited by the Marvel Rivals team.

4190
02:13:09,310 --> 02:13:10,910
Huge shout out to them for inviting me.

4191
02:13:11,390 --> 02:13:11,830
Um...

4192
02:13:11,830 --> 02:13:12,270
Uh...

4193
02:13:12,270 --> 02:13:13,570
New updates every...

4194
02:13:13,570 --> 02:13:13,990
Almost...

4195
02:13:13,990 --> 02:13:15,030
I think like every month now.

4196
02:13:15,150 --> 02:13:17,370
There's gonna be new updates almost every month now.

4197
02:13:17,630 --> 02:13:17,990
Uh...

4198
02:13:17,990 --> 02:13:19,090
New hero updates too.

4199
02:13:19,710 --> 02:13:20,230
Um...

4200
02:13:20,230 --> 02:13:21,030
So...

4201
02:13:21,030 --> 02:13:21,550
Uh...

4202
02:13:21,550 --> 02:13:21,890
But yeah.

4203
02:13:21,950 --> 02:13:22,790
I hope you guys enjoy it.

4204
02:13:23,070 --> 02:13:23,470
Uh...

4205
02:13:23,470 --> 02:13:24,310
I'm glad that...

4206
02:13:24,310 --> 02:13:25,470
The teams were...

4207
02:13:26,050 --> 02:13:26,610
Still evil...

4208
02:13:27,730 --> 02:13:28,250
Like...

4209
02:13:28,250 --> 02:13:29,290
The other team...

4210
02:13:29,290 --> 02:13:29,890
Um...

4211
02:13:29,890 --> 02:13:31,710
The other team also like...

4212
02:13:32,250 --> 02:13:32,770
Um...

4213
02:13:32,770 --> 02:13:33,490
Um...

4214
02:13:33,490 --> 02:13:35,590
Like you know were not tri-harding and everything.

4215
02:13:35,770 --> 02:13:36,710
And we were all just like vibing.

4216
02:13:37,150 --> 02:13:37,850
So that was great.

4217
02:13:38,050 --> 02:13:38,730
Because like...

4218
02:13:38,730 --> 02:13:40,850
Obviously we have newer...

4219
02:13:40,850 --> 02:13:41,710
Not new players.

4220
02:13:41,950 --> 02:13:44,790
But obviously players that don't play the game as much.

4221
02:13:45,130 --> 02:13:45,530
Uh...

4222
02:13:45,530 --> 02:13:48,450
So it was nice that everyone adjusted to chill and everything.

4223
02:13:48,810 --> 02:13:50,230
And just like you know...

4224
02:13:50,230 --> 02:13:51,150
Have fun and everything.

4225
02:13:51,450 --> 02:13:51,850
Uh...

4226
02:13:51,850 --> 02:13:53,190
So it was really, really fun.

4227
02:13:53,670 --> 02:13:57,550
But yeah, it was great checking out the new map, checking out the new heroes, showing you guys everything.

4228
02:13:57,870 --> 02:13:59,330
Hawkeye is back!

4229
02:14:04,670 --> 02:14:07,810
Hawkeye is definitely back, back.

4230
02:14:10,950 --> 02:14:18,610
Yeah, like, the moment Gale was on Hawkeye, it killed everybody with my Luna power-ups.

4231
02:14:18,670 --> 02:14:20,350
That was pretty scary.

4232
02:14:23,630 --> 02:14:30,390
Ultron, I think, either needs a third support or, like, need a main healer.

4233
02:14:30,530 --> 02:14:32,630
Because, like, he does not do that much healing.

4234
02:14:34,070 --> 02:14:34,550
IMO.

4235
02:14:34,750 --> 02:14:36,470
He definitely does not do enough healing.

4236
02:14:38,230 --> 02:14:39,990
Unless you have the Iron Man team-up.

4237
02:14:40,090 --> 02:14:46,370
But even then, even with the Iron Man team-up, it's still, like, it's still not that much.

4238
02:14:46,490 --> 02:14:49,530
So I think, like, he's a great DPS, though.

4239
02:14:49,890 --> 02:14:52,350
Um, DPS is, like, pretty strong.

4240
02:14:52,890 --> 02:14:56,130
Um, I think- I honestly think Jeff can be really good.

4241
02:14:56,330 --> 02:14:59,590
Like, I know, like, when I was playing Jeff, it was not working really well.

4242
02:14:59,770 --> 02:15:04,370
But also, like, it's because, like, I think it's because our team was- we're all, like, doing solos and stuff.

4243
02:15:04,590 --> 02:15:12,430
We're all, like, you know, they were all doing, like, like, clips and, like, gameplay, like, you know, trying to clips- do clips and clip farm and stuff like that.

4244
02:15:12,430 --> 02:15:15,710
But I think Jeff can be really, really good.

4245
02:15:15,990 --> 02:15:21,270
It's just that my team was uncoordinated to make- to uncoordinated to make Jeff work.

4246
02:15:21,770 --> 02:15:26,770
Um, but in a coordinated environment, he is really- I think he is really, really good.

4247
02:15:27,250 --> 02:15:31,270
Um, due to the fact that, like, especially if it's broad comp.

4248
02:15:31,410 --> 02:15:36,910
If it's broad comp and not, uh, if it's broad comp, um, it would have been really strong.

4249
02:15:36,910 --> 02:15:41,510
And if we had a- we did the Jeff-Storm team up better, it could be really, really strong.

4250
02:15:41,670 --> 02:15:43,610
I mean, the enemy team pulled off Jeff-Storm really well.

4251
02:15:44,010 --> 02:15:47,410
I- me- I think it was, like, me and Necros, we were not coordinated enough.

4252
02:15:47,530 --> 02:15:49,470
I was, like- and then they had a Punisher.

4253
02:15:49,610 --> 02:15:50,830
They instantly knew how to counter.

4254
02:15:50,970 --> 02:15:51,910
They were, like, Punisher time.

4255
02:15:51,910 --> 02:15:55,730
I was, like, guys, I need someone- Mom, pick me up!

4256
02:15:55,950 --> 02:15:56,310
Mom!

4257
02:15:58,810 --> 02:16:01,390
I was, like, Mom, pick me up!

4258
02:16:01,750 --> 02:16:02,110
Please!

4259
02:16:06,750 --> 02:16:08,090
I was, like, no!

4260
02:16:10,510 --> 02:16:12,150
I was, like, where is Mom?

4261
02:16:12,530 --> 02:16:13,350
Where is she?

4262
02:16:17,260 --> 02:16:20,360
Um, and then Mom was too late.

4263
02:16:20,640 --> 02:16:22,400
She was too late to pick me up.

4264
02:16:22,900 --> 02:16:23,040
Shoot.

4265
02:16:25,140 --> 02:16:28,800
But, um, I had a lot of fun, though.

4266
02:16:29,060 --> 02:16:31,020
Um, and I hope a lot of people had fun watching.

4267
02:16:31,020 --> 02:16:34,040
Uh, I have to go now to do my meet and greet at Fanime.
