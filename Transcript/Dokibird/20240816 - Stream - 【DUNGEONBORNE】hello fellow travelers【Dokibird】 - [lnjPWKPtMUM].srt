1
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,660
Hello, hello, everybody!

2
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,960
Good morning!

3
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,220
Alright, so, yes, I don't sound dead inside right now.

4
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,540
It's cause, like, it's cause, like, Dad has been waking me up early in the morning!

5
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:05,900
So, no more, no more waking up at, like, 1220 before the stream!

6
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,000
Um, because, unless, like, I, unless I, like, pass out right after the walk.

7
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:20,420
So, uh, basically, alright, guys, I think I may or may not be spoiling Dad a little bit too much now.

8
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,860
So, I usually, okay, I keep my, um, sounds echoey.

9
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,660
Okay, I have, like, okay, I do have the soundproof stuff here.

10
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,740
Uh, I just haven't had time to hang anything up yet.

11
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,880
But, like, let me put a bunch of these.

12
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,760
Alright, so, I do have, like, these, um, echo absorber things.

13
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,900
On me right now.

14
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,560
Like, it's right here.

15
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,920
Uh, but I don't know where to put them.

16
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,640
So, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna put some here.

17
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,960
I'm just, I'm, they're just on the floor.

18
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,140
They're, they're, they're, like, scattered everywhere right now.

19
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,560
I'm gonna put one over a, in the pile of plushies.

20
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:02,300
So, they're, like, they're, like, literally scattered everywhere on the floor.

21
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,380
Against the wall, against the table.

22
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,500
I have them, um, scattered everywhere at the moment.

23
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,160
So...

24
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,820
I didn't have time to hang it up because yesterday I fucking passed out.

25
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,960
Uh, I, I passed out yesterday.

26
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,560
So, I didn't have time to, um, to really, like, put stuff away.

27
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,220
Maybe I should put one against my wall.

28
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,780
Maybe that would help.

29
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,380
Maybe I put this over here.

30
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,860
It'd be less echoey.

31
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,940
Maybe, I don't know, where do I put this?

32
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:40,000
I can't put it against the wall in front of me because, like, uh...

33
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,860
Because, like, oh, man.

34
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,000
Uh...

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,800
Ooh...

36
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,140
Uh...

37
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,160
Oh, fuck it.

38
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:47,900
You go on the floor.

39
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,480
You're gonna...

40
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,780
You're gonna be on the floor.

41
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,680
I can't be bothered right now.

42
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,780
Um...

43
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:07,000
But, like, I feel like by, by the member stream, we should have some fucking form of, like, acoustic barrier set up somehow.

44
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,120
Um...

45
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,480
Anyway.

46
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,600
So...

47
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,900
He's been, like...

48
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,640
He's been, like, a little bitch right now.

49
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,400
He's, like, super fucking spoiled at the moment.

50
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,240
Uh...

51
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,220
Because, like, I leave my bedroom door open.

52
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:20,820
Right?

53
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,640
So...

54
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,800
Because of that...

55
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,560
Because of that, every time I go stream, he just heads towards my bed and just sleeps in my bed.

56
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,060
Like, he usually never does that in the past.

57
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,260
He would, you know, go to his own bed.

58
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,980
But now, he's like, wait.

59
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,920
I can just sleep on her bed.

60
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,300
And then, like...

61
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,380
So, yesterday, I was like, alright.

62
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,480
I'm just gonna...

63
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,800
I'm just gonna...

64
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,360
Um...

65
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,020
You know...

66
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,620
Go to sleep.

67
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,500
And then, I closed my door.

68
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:47,960
I would...

69
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,700
I didn't let him in.

70
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,700
I didn't...

71
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,220
I didn't...

72
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,040
I didn't...

73
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,420
I don't know.

74
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,340
He has this...

75
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,440
It doesn't help that I do have, like, staircases to my bed.

76
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:58,860
Because I...

77
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,920
You know, he's a wiener dog.

78
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,000
So, like...

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,480
Um...

80
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,820
I have staircases.

81
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,200
Because I don't want to fuck his back.

82
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,240
So, like...

83
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,480
Uh...

84
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,200
Fuck with his back.

85
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,200
Because he's too long.

86
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,380
Um...

87
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,260
So, like...

88
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,120
It doesn't help that he does have a staircase to my bed.

89
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,940
Um...

90
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,560
Anyway...

91
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,200
Uh...

92
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:14,900
So, like...

93
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,540
You know...

94
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,180
Uh...

95
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,340
I was doing some work stuff on my PC, and then I went to check...

96
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,500
I went to grab some water in the kitchen, and then I just...

97
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,900
This is what I saw.

98
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,400
I'll show you guys a photo.

99
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,420
This is like...

100
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,680
The first thing I saw.

101
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,560
I was like, are you fucking kidding me?

102
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,760
I was like...

103
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,660
I was like, are you fucking kidding me?

104
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,640
This is literally...

105
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:56,080
The first thing I saw and he like dragged the body pillow and then he like dragged my pillow to like so he could like lean against him.

106
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,580
He's like, this is my bed now.

107
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:15,900
So yeah, so like this is what I saw today this morning when I was like trying to fucking grab water.

108
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:21,220
And I'm like, wait, just like, okay, the thing is, uh, all right, let me show you another picture.

109
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:28,480
So like, this is another thing I saw in my I'll show you the other picture I saw too, which I was like, are you fucking kidding me?

110
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,220
I saw this, I was like, this I saw like a few days ago.

111
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:50,860
So this one, you know, he is, he's like, you know, it's not, it's like, okay, I was just like, what the fuck are you doing?

112
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,300
Yeah.

113
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,580
So like, he's so fucking spoiled now.

114
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,820
He's so.

115
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,840
fucking spoiled.

116
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,840
And because like, last night, I was like, Okay, I want the bed to myself.

117
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:12,180
Like, yesterday, I was like, Okay, all right, I dad, I want the bed all to myself.

118
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,360
Like I, I, I just leave.

119
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:23,040
Because like, two days ago, he started sleeping in the middle of the bed while I'm trying to sleep.

120
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,340
So like, he's like trying to sleep in the middle of the bed.

121
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,880
I was like, No, no, no.

122
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,040
Well the bed is bad, what's your problem?

123
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,220
I was like, okay, we can't let you do that.

124
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,140
Because like, I need a sleep in this bed, and you're a fucking furnace too.

125
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,000
So I was just like, move.

126
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:49,080
And then he refused to move so I have to like, sleep at the like edge of the bed, because he wouldn't fucking move.

127
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,420
So annoyed.

128
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,140
So like, yesterday I tried to kick him out of my room, And I was like, No, you sleep outside.

129
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:55,600
Now.

130
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,120
I want the whole bed today.

131
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,020
Like yesterday, I was like, there's just like, I want this entire bed.

132
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,560
And then it was like midnight.

133
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,660
It was midnight.

134
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,000
And he just kept barking.

135
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,540
He's like, no!

136
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:23,960
And then usually you ignore the dog because you don't want to give him the idea that the more he barks, the more likely you're going to open the door.

137
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,440
But he kept barking for 10 minutes.

138
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,800
I was like, I was so scared.

139
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,960
I was going to get a fucking noise complaint because it's midnight.

140
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,420
I was so scared.

141
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,200
I was like, I don't want to get kicked out already.

142
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,080
And then I was like, I give up.

143
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,100
After like 10 plus minutes, I'll give up.

144
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,740
And I opened the door and he ran straight.

145
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,300
Like the moment I opened the door, he ran straight to the bed.

146
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,240
And he just like, it was like one second.

147
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,100
I literally opened the door and he ran right there.

148
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,460
And just, and just like underneath my, and then he fucking crawled underneath the blankets too.

149
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,740
He was like, ran there, crawled underneath the blankets and was like, he's like, sleep time.

150
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,440
It was like, sleep time.

151
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,600
I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?

152
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,040
And then quiet, no sound.

153
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,280
And then, and then, okay, this is the worst part.

154
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,160
Today, like, oh my God.

155
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,100
Today, he like fucking woke me up.

156
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,380
Cause like, he was like, it's time to feed me.

157
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,200
And I looked at the, I looked at my phone.

158
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,260
I was like, it's 7am.

159
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,280
Please, I just want to sleep two more hours.

160
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,560
Dad, I just want to...

161
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,100
Jokey Amber Doge, I just want to sleep at least one or two more hours.

162
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,480
And he's like, no, feed me.

163
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,620
And then, okay, so like, he's allergic to everything, right?

164
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,040
So like, I'm, I'm waiting to...

165
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:59,420
I usually, after every walk, I would like, wipe his paws.

166
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,540
Because like, because he's allergic to everything.

167
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,020
He's allergic to like, numerous kinds of trees.

168
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,180
And like, he's allergic to like, various things.

169
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,060
He's allergic to nature, basically.

170
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,700
But his allergies makes him itchy.

171
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:19,280
So like, usually after every walk, I would like, I have to like, wipe his paws and everything.

172
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,980
So yeah, he's allergic to...

173
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,320
He's...

174
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,800
This is how fucked up his genetics are.

175
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,880
He's literally allergic to maple trees.

176
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,720
And I'm like, that's Canada.

177
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,920
For those who don't know the history of Dad.

178
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:34,900
He...

179
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,040
One of his allergies is maple trees.

180
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,040
And we literally live in Canada.

181
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,540
So...

182
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,900
So...

183
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,660
It just makes him like, more itchy.

184
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,820
And...

185
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,100
And the thing is...

186
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,100
The thing is...

187
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:50,560
Like...

188
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,140
Usually after every walk, I have to wipe his paws.

189
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,120
So like...

190
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,480
Because like, he's been scratching a lot too.

191
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,740
But I...

192
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,760
I don't have like, pet friendly wet wipes.

193
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Because like, I don't...

194
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,220
I don't want to use like, normal wet wipes.

195
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,000
Because I know like, some of it is like, really bad for dogs.

196
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,420
So like, for pets.

197
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,920
So I'm like, waiting...

198
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,160
Like, it should be delivered today.

199
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,660
So I haven't been like, wiping his paws the last couple of days.

200
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,380
I've been getting like...

201
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,300
I've been wetting...

202
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,060
I mean, I've been trying to like, get like...

203
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,540
I've been like, getting some Kleenex and like, wetting like, tissue.

204
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,840
And to like, clean his paws.

205
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:27,940
So like...

206
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,700
But I don't think it's like, working as well.

207
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,560
But yeah.

208
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,900
Like, today I should be getting the dog...

209
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,500
Dog friendly wet wipes.

210
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:36,620
And...

211
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,200
And so like...

212
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,720
So he's been scratching a lot lately.

213
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,240
And I've been helping him like, scratch as well.

214
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:44,500
Anyway...

215
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:45,800
Anyway...

216
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,520
So...

217
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,240
So like, he woke me up today.

218
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,460
He woke me up today.

219
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,360
And he's like...

220
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,560
Feed me!

221
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,520
Or he's scratching himself.

222
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,080
He's like...

223
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,100
I'm so itchy!

224
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:58,980
I'm like...

225
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,680
And then I have...

226
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,300
And then...

227
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,480
He's so spoiled.

228
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,920
To the point where like...

229
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,360
I was like...

230
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:03,960
I can't.

231
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,880
I need to sleep one more hour.

232
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,260
I can't.

233
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,100
It's way too early.

234
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,040
It's way too early, dad.

235
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,400
It's...

236
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,260
It's way too fucking early.

237
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,120
And...

238
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,960
And so...

239
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,800
I just like...

240
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,920
I just ignore him.

241
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:14,700
I turn around.

242
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,760
And then...

243
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,260
He fucking jumps over my body.

244
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,440
To the other side.

245
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,560
To where I turn away from him.

246
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,920
And then he like...

247
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,120
He uses his nose.

248
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:24,760
And like...

249
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,220
To like...

250
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:25,980
To like...

251
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,800
To like...

252
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,900
Move my hands.

253
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,220
To his body.

254
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,080
To be like...

255
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,480
Now scratch me.

256
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,600
And I'm like...

257
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,480
Are you fucking...

258
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,200
He literally uses his nose.

259
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:38,760
He'd be like...

260
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,280
Underneath my hand.

261
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,320
To like...

262
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,540
Make it so that it's positioned.

263
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,720
To where his like...

264
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,740
Belly is.

265
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,580
Or arms.

266
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:46,940
He's like...

267
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,140
Yeah.

268
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,200
Scratch me.

269
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,420
Scratch me.

270
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:49,780
Now.

271
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,200
And I'd be like...

272
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,820
You fucker.

273
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,280
And then...

274
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,260
I would scratch him.

275
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:53,680
And they're like...

276
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:53,880
Okay.

277
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,280
I'm done.

278
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,100
I need to sleep.

279
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,460
And then I turn away.

280
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,340
I like...

281
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,040
Turn away again.

282
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,420
And then he like...

283
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,760
He jumps over my body.

284
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,200
And does the same thing.

285
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,280
And...

286
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,060
And he's like...

287
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,400
You think you can get away from me?

288
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,340
And be like...

289
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,040
Scratch me.

290
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,940
And he does it.

291
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:13,700
I like...

292
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,020
Like...

293
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,080
I turn around.

294
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,000
Like...

295
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,360
Three to four times.

296
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,200
And he kept doing it.

297
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,420
I was like...

298
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:19,940
Are you...

299
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,940
Are you fucking kidding me?

300
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,020
I was just like...

301
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,420
Please.

302
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,460
Let me...

303
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,820
I will feed you.

304
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,260
I will feed you.

305
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,180
And I will scratch you more.

306
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,420
Just give me one more hour.

307
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,440
I swear to fuck.

308
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,620
I need one more hour.

309
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,060
Anyway.

310
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,260
Anyway.

311
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,800
I was scratching him.

312
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,520
I was like...

313
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,540
I kept scratching him for him.

314
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,740
And I did like that he was scratching himself.

315
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,140
Anyway.

316
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:49,400
I'm done.

317
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:54,160
Uh, so yeah, he's been like super fucking spoiled now.

318
00:13:54,280 --> 00:14:11,540
And like, I am definitely I'm going to like, I feel like I might hire a I might hire a personal dog trainer, because he's getting a little bit too naughty.

319
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,760
He's his he he thinks he's he basically thinks he's alpha right now.

320
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,120
This tiny ass dog.

321
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,780
This is a tiny ass dog thinks he's alpha at the moment.

322
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:29,480
So like, I'm I'm thinking of hiring a personal dog trainer to like, to like, teach him his place again.

323
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,960
It's because like, I don't know.

324
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,820
Ever since I ever since I moved to this new place, he's like, I own this place.

325
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:46,660
He's like, he's like, now that we're in a new location, this is my kingdom.

326
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,020
Oh, my God.

327
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,660
Oh, my God.

328
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,900
And then he's so okay.

329
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:02,960
The thing is, when he's like, when he's like leashed, he's so aggressive towards other dogs.

330
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:03,920
I don't understand.

331
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,400
But like, if you like at dog parks, he's okay.

332
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,520
Like at dog parks, he's okay.

333
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:15,520
But for some reason, whenever like I take him for walks, he's super aggressive to other.

334
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,740
He's like, this is my.

335
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:26,020
My grass, like, like, there was like, there was a lady that was walking your dog and like one of them was like unleashed and it was tiny.

336
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,240
It was like those toy poodles, those tiny like toy poodles.

337
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,300
And then.

338
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,840
And then he was like, he was like, he's like, what are you doing?

339
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:41,020
Like, walked up and he's like, but I was like, oh,

340
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:53,660
he's like, no, don't you dare get close to me.

341
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:04,400
And then like, and then like one guy, like he walked up to one guy and then, you know, I thought he was being friendly.

342
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,000
He walked up to this one guy.

343
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,260
This was not today, by the way.

344
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,520
This is like two days ago.

345
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,960
He walked up to him and then he was like looking at him.

346
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,860
He's like sniffing him.

347
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,120
And then like, obviously that guy thought he was going to pet him.

348
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,980
Like he wanted, like that guy thought he wanted, he wanted pets.

349
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,660
And then he like put his hand down and then, and then dad was like, oh.

350
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,380
Yeah.

351
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,720
I was like, I'm so sorry.

352
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,240
I'm so I'm so sorry.

353
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,560
I know he gave you the look.

354
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,380
I don't know man

355
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,140
He got baited.

356
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,820
He got baited so hard.

357
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,120
And we were in the elevator.

358
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,100
That was the worst part.

359
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,880
Like we were in an elevator too.

360
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,440
Yeah.

361
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,900
Oh my God.

362
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,080
Being a beta to the wiener dog.

363
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,780
Betty thank you for the super chat.

364
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,120
Thank you.

365
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:20,660
Thank you.

366
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,160
Okay.

367
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,520
No, you don't understand.

368
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:27,040
Wiener dogs have to be like one of the most like aggressive dogs.

369
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,180
In the world because they were literally trained to hunt badgers.

370
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,320
Those little tiny fuckers were trained to be...

371
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,680
Have you guys not seen the fucked up video of two wiener dogs tag teaming a snake?

372
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,360
That shit was crazy.

373
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:51,980
I... I remember seeing that video and then the fucking two wiener dogs were flinging the snake around like a toy.

374
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,720
And I'm like, holy shit.

375
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,460
Like and then ripping the snake in half.

376
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,300
Like literally like...

377
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,740
Like they were playing tug of war on a fucking snake.

378
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,040
And I was like, Jesus fucking Christ.

379
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,160
That shit was crazy.

380
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,120
I was like, oh my God, that's dead.

381
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,320
That's...

382
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,640
Yeah, they're very...

383
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,000
They're very vicious.

384
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:15,280
Like I try to not give him any stuffed animals because like...

385
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,540
Like it never works.

386
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,080
He always rips apart every stuffed animal I gave him.

387
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,740
And the cleanup is such a bitch.

388
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,240
You guys haven't seen it?

389
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,220
Oh my God.

390
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:23,440
No.

391
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:23,760
Okay.

392
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,800
Like I would say like trigger warning because...

393
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,720
That shit was gory.

394
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,260
Like...

395
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,760
Like...

396
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,920
Like at first, like, you know, the snake's body was...

397
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,860
Was full intact.

398
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,600
And then later on, it's like...

399
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,360
You see bone.

400
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,260
And I was like...

401
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,820
And I was just like...

402
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,840
Oh my God.

403
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:47,780
Like...

404
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,500
And then after like 30 seconds, bones.

405
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,780
And I'm like...

406
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,400
And you look up like...

407
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,080
I think like...

408
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,600
Dash hound.

409
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,280
Dash hound.

410
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,780
Or sorry, dachshund.

411
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,540
I don't know how you call it.

412
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:04,980
Dash hound.

413
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,600
Like dachshund.

414
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,180
Dachshund versus snakes or some shit.

415
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,640
Oh my God.

416
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,260
Like...

417
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,180
It's so fucked.

418
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,340
It actually is so fucked.

419
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,580
But yeah, he's...

420
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,460
He's getting very spoiled now.

421
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,380
And...

422
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,400
And I'm definitely gonna have to...

423
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:26,940
I might...

424
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,100
I'm...

425
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,040
I'm thinking about hiring a personal trainer to like...

426
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,060
Like...

427
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,340
Calm him down and remind him that...

428
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,220
No, he does not own this apartment.

429
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,180
It's cause he think...

430
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:38,540
It's...

431
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,460
I think it's cause like...

432
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,700
I moved to a new place.

433
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,880
So then he's like...

434
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,980
This is mine now.

435
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:43,740
So like...

436
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,060
That's why he got way more spoiled than before.

437
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,280
So...

438
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:52,720
So...

439
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,840
So like...

440
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,600
So I was like...

441
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,120
No, you have to train him.

442
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,520
Doki.

443
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,860
But what time?

444
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:58,720
I...

445
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,700
That's the thing.

446
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,080
I don't have time right now.

447
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,380
I'm so behind on so much work.

448
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,920
I would train him...

449
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,840
If I have the extra time.

450
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,220
The thing is...

451
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:08,760
I don't.

452
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,220
And I need him to cut it out.

453
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,700
I need him to stop doing that.

454
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,540
I...

455
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,120
I need him to stop.

456
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,160
Yeah, but like...

457
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,180
The personal trainer will give him the basics.

458
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:28,700
And then...

459
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,020
Like...

460
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,020
We'll fast track the basics.

461
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:31,920
And then...

462
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,120
And then like...

463
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,580
And then...

464
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:33,960
I don't know.

465
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,960
Then the personal trainer will be like...

466
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,060
Alright.

467
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,180
You gotta do this and this.

468
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,260
And then I can do it.

469
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,180
I can't do...

470
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,400
I can't do the starting process.

471
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,580
I need...

472
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,020
I need...

473
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,400
I need a trainer to like...

474
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,340
Get him back into the starting process.

475
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,680
And then I can be like...

476
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,020
Okay.

477
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:46,860
Now.

478
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:47,520
Now...

479
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,320
And then I swoop in and take all the credit.

480
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,160
That's...

481
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,560
He's actually...

482
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,380
Absolutely.

483
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,260
Oh my gosh.

484
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:57,940
Anyway.

485
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:58,700
So...

486
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,440
Another update.

487
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,220
For those who don't follow me on Twitter.

488
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,280
Uh...

489
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,040
My Five Nights at Freddy's VOD, the Into the Pit got age restricted.

490
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,000
So...

491
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,780
Basically, you have to be 18 plus or older to watch that VOD now.

492
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,500
I...

493
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,560
I think it's the title.

494
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,500
I think it's the...

495
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,740
Is that the Bite of 69?

496
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,120
I think that...

497
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:18,660
I don't know.

498
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,320
I don't know.

499
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,140
I don't know.

500
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,380
I think it's the title.

501
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,560
I have no idea why it got age restricted.

502
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,680
Anyway.

503
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,920
The thing is...

504
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,100
I appealed it.

505
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,660
I appealed the...

506
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,360
Uh...

507
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,680
I tried to appeal it.

508
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,560
And then it got instantly rejected.

509
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,740
Like the...

510
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,060
Like after like five minutes, it got instantly rejected.

511
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,080
And like...

512
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,760
It's not like I appealed it at like...

513
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,760
Like prime YouTube hours too.

514
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,120
I appealed it at like...

515
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,600
At like 11 PM.

516
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:46,580
And then...

517
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,800
So I messaged my YouTube guy about it.

518
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,880
They haven't responded yet.

519
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,020
I don't know if they're like at work yet or like...

520
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,220
They're busy at the moment.

521
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,400
Um...

522
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:55,980
Um...

523
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,480
But yeah.

524
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,360
It got...

525
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:57,940
It got...

526
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,040
It got...

527
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,080
It got...

528
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,860
I like how it waited a day before age restricting it.

529
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,420
I literally got the message that it's like...

530
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,080
Um...

531
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,640
It got age restricted like last night at like around 8 PM or something.

532
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,600
So...

533
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,440
I thought that was funny.

534
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,040
I was like...

535
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,520
I was like...

536
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:11,720
Why?

537
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,640
I was like...

538
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,920
I was like...

539
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,180
I'm pretty sure...

540
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:15,960
Like...

541
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,000
FNAF is such a popular...

542
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,940
It's such a popular series.

543
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,540
I am not the first person to make that joke.

544
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,000
There's no fucking way.

545
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,080
I cannot be the first person to make that joke.

546
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,320
Like...

547
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,560
Is that the bite of 69?

548
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,300
Like...

549
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:30,920
It's such a...

550
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,060
It's such a like 13 year old humor.

551
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:33,500
It's like...

552
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,400
Oh my god.

553
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,040
The 420 blazed 69.

554
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:37,980
Like...

555
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,780
Oh my god.

556
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,240
Just...

557
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,060
I'm just like...

558
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,700
How's that?

559
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:41,740
How's...

560
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,900
How's that 18 plus?

561
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,580
That's literally high...

562
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,400
Middle school to high school humor.

563
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,900
I don't understand.

564
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:51,960
Anyway...

565
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,480
Um...

566
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,020
I...

567
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,180
I asked my YouTube guy to be like...

568
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,080
What the fuck happened?

569
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,640
Like...

570
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,200
Do I need to change the title?

571
00:22:59,440 --> 00:22:59,740
Like...

572
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,320
What do I do?

573
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,220
Uh...

574
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,820
No...

575
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,760
The PG...

576
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,400
Even in PG 13 things...

577
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,100
People make the 69 joke.

578
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,380
It's not...

579
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,680
It's not...

580
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,740
It's not fucking 18 plus shit.

581
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,100
Come on...

582
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,960
It's like...

583
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,880
Oh my god.

584
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,800
69...

585
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,280
420...

586
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,000
Oh...

587
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:23,660
Oh...

588
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:23,740
Oh...

589
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,100
Oh...

590
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,160
Oh...

591
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,440
Oh...

592
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:25,480
Oh...

593
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:25,660
Oh...

594
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,460
Oh...

595
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:26,520
Oh...

596
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:26,560
Oh...

597
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:26,960
Oh...

598
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,640
Anyway...

599
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,060
Anyway...

600
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:32,200
Anyway...

601
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,760
It's time to play Dungeonborn.

602
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,220
So...

603
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,400
Um...

604
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,180
There might be issues with this game.

605
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm not sure yet.

606
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:39,760
Because like...

607
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,500
I got hit by the anti-cheat thing.

608
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,400
So...

609
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:42,940
Um...

610
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,260
We're gonna see.

611
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,820
All right.

612
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,420
Whoa.

613
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,140
Whoa.

614
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:57,940
Okay.

615
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,060
Okay.

616
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,020
Am I okay yet?

617
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,340
Okay.

618
00:23:59,420 --> 00:23:59,940
I'm okay now.

619
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,800
It was just the start.

620
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,380
All right.

621
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,640
I think the funny thing is that you have to be 13 or older to play Dungeonborn.

622
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,360
All right.

623
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,380
I confirm.

624
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,520
I am...

625
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,200
13 years and older.

626
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,140
All right.

627
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,300
Why is it not...

628
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:12,780
Oh my god.

629
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,480
Don't tell me.

630
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:13,940
This is...

631
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,420
Is this one of those games where...

632
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,000
Oh...

633
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,400
I think it is.

634
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,140
Okay.

635
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:19,700
Give me a...

636
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,040
Guys.

637
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,860
It's one of those games where...

638
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,840
It doesn't...

639
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,740
Are you serious?

640
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,380
Okay.

641
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,660
I know what's wrong.

642
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,400
These are one of the...

643
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,040
These are the games that require you to...

644
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,340
You can only stream it in a window capture.

645
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,480
God, I hate that.

646
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,360
I hate that...

647
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,060
I hate that when games do that.

648
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,520
All right.

649
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,300
Tutorial time.

650
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,900
So, basically, Dungeonborn is...

651
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,180
Oh.

652
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,060
Oh.

653
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,920
Is it mining Bitcoin right now?

654
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,240
Okay.

655
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,120
Let's see.

656
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,040
This is basically Dark and Darker.

657
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,040
But easier.

658
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,640
That's from what my friends told me.

659
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:06,520
This is Dark and Darker, but like easy Dark and Darker.

660
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:06,880
Okay.

661
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,720
Let's just do high.

662
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,380
We don't...

663
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,320
It's like...

664
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,940
These graphics are not going to improve.

665
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:11,740
Anyway.

666
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,140
Okay.

667
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:12,720
Voice chat.

668
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,640
Push to talk.

669
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,660
All right.

670
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,760
If it's push to talk, I want to...

671
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,680
Push to talk.

672
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,040
Okay.

673
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,480
It's T.

674
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,440
How do I adjust...

675
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,220
Control...

676
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:24,400
Whoa.

677
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,060
How am I lagging?

678
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,580
How's my mouse lagging?

679
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,040
That's actually crazy.

680
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,260
Screenshot on dead?

681
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:33,940
Really?

682
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,840
Holy shit.

683
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:38,920
Okay.

684
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,840
Oh.

685
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,540
No camera sway, please.

686
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,960
Textures high.

687
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,080
Sharpness.

688
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,800
Let's see.

689
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,760
Is there a motion blur?

690
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,700
No motion...

691
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,800
As long as there's no motion blur, that's good.

692
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,460
So.

693
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,020
Okay.

694
00:25:59,020 --> 00:25:59,740
Okay.

695
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,620
I like how it tells me...

696
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,460
You're like, oh, my God.

697
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,900
I could see, like, the file location.

698
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,420
Yeah.

699
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:09,940
Yeah.

700
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,980
It's like, oh, my God.

701
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,860
The file location name isn't Doki.

702
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,260
Yeah.

703
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:13,720
It's not.

704
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,020
It's my first dog.

705
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,860
All right.

706
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,400
Let's see.

707
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,740
What is the...

708
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,020
Yeah.

709
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,760
I usually name my PCs after my first dog.

710
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,000
Okay.

711
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,860
So, like, I think Guy for no motion blur.

712
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,160
Yeah.

713
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,140
Let's see.

714
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,580
Did I tell you guys?

715
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,860
One of the...

716
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,400
One of the...

717
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,120
God.

718
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,420
This is so embarrassing.

719
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:46,680
This is not...

720
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,040
The name is one of my dogs.

721
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,960
So, I've owned, like...

722
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:54,500
Like, I've owned, like, lots of Wiener dogs over the years.

723
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,780
Because, like, ever since I owned my parents and I own...

724
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,000
Oh, my God.

725
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,620
Our first Wiener dog, we've always...

726
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,320
We've...

727
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,680
Is there something in front of me?

728
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,660
I'm in the settings because this is multiplayer.

729
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,540
I heard something.

730
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,240
Am I going to get out of settings and then I'll be dead?

731
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,520
Like, where's the controls?

732
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,660
I'm trying to...

733
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,020
Is it automatically T?

734
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,440
I was trying to find controls.

735
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,800
I can't find any control.

736
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,260
Okay.

737
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,760
We don't need to look at our reflection.

738
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,780
All right.

739
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,260
Anyway.

740
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,380
But one of the Wiener dogs...

741
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:28,980
I used to...

742
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,960
I used to own was called Gilbert.

743
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,300
And I'll let you guys try to figure out where Gilbert came from.

744
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,000
Is there no sense?

745
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,120
This is the whole reason why I fucking came here.

746
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,900
Because I need to try to find the sensitivity.

747
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,280
I'm trying to find the sensitivity.

748
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,780
Oh, my God.

749
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,640
There's no game sense?

750
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,800
Oh, God.

751
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,220
Okay.

752
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,320
All right.

753
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,120
Just so you know, it's not Gilbert.

754
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,820
It was not inspired by Gilbert Godfrey.

755
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,240
Just so you guys know.

756
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,800
Whatever you guys might...

757
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,280
All right.

758
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,020
Okay.

759
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:14,860
This is defend.

760
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,400
All right.

761
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,060
Okay.

762
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,040
I still take damage.

763
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,480
All right.

764
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,820
So, it's basically darker and darker.

765
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,480
Okay.

766
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,480
It's in the main menu.

767
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:24,960
All right.

768
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,160
Oh.

769
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,280
It's basically dark and darker.

770
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:28,700
Wait.

771
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,680
It is basically...

772
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,200
Oh, my God.

773
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:30,440
Ew.

774
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,480
Even the animation.

775
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,160
That's me.

776
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:34,500
Oh.

777
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,700
Look at those sick abs.

778
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,600
I'm so dehydrated as fuck.

779
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:39,820
Wait.

780
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,820
It's literally...

781
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,160
Wait.

782
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,800
This is literally dark and darker.

783
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:45,840
All right.

784
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,840
We'll grab some clothes.

785
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:48,960
All right.

786
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,120
Big sword.

787
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,440
Is this loot?

788
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:55,960
Oh.

789
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:56,700
I didn't see that.

790
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,000
Okay.

791
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:57,820
Did I loot this?

792
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,220
Oh, wait.

793
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,360
No.

794
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,100
This is the same loot.

795
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,200
Okay.

796
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:00,420
All right.

797
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:01,980
Same loot.

798
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,600
The combat is better.

799
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:18,220
Well, to be fair, dark and darker has a very bad reputation right now because of the whole it's free, but most of the good stuff is only available if you pay for the game.

800
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,800
So their reputation isn't looking so good.

801
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:26,240
And then at least Dungeonborn isn't in the middle of a lawsuit, too.

802
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,660
So like...

803
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:30,900
Dungeonborn isn't actually...

804
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,540
Oh, shit!

805
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,440
It's a little sad.

806
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,700
All right.

807
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,060
Whoa.

808
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,200
Hello.

809
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,240
Charge?

810
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:41,600
Oh.

811
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,600
Boom.

812
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,580
Oh, okay.

813
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:46,940
Boom.

814
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,100
Yeah.

815
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:48,720
And it's free.

816
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,080
Boom.

817
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,820
Oh, he's blocking.

818
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,860
This is not fair.

819
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,020
Oh, shit.

820
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:55,220
Wait.

821
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,420
I can jump dodge.

822
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:58,920
Oh.

823
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,380
JK.

824
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,400
Oh.

825
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:02,940
JK.

826
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,280
I cannot jump dodge, guys.

827
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,480
All right.

828
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,080
Let's see.

829
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:08,580
Am I?

830
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,560
Yay!

831
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,320
Yeah.

832
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:11,620
It's...

833
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,680
And then I heard there's SBMM, too.

834
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:21,480
So like when you first start out, you're going to play with other players that first started as well.

835
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:25,040
So they're like actual SBMM.

836
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,300
Okay.

837
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,400
E is the charge.

838
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,280
I need to remember that.

839
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:29,680
Block.

840
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,060
Counterattack after successful dodge.

841
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:32,640
Wait.

842
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,600
Counterattack after successful dodge.

843
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:35,800
Okay.

844
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:37,640
Parry.

845
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,480
Block right before being hit.

846
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,400
Oh, there's parry.

847
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,180
There's perfect counterattack.

848
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,040
What the fuck?

849
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,220
There's perfect counterattack.

850
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,160
Okay.

851
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,580
You guys don't see it, but like...

852
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,380
Yeah.

853
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,060
It's like gear-based matchmaking.

854
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,500
So you have no gear.

855
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:57,320
You're going to fight other characters with no gear, which is pretty interesting because, you know.

856
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,260
Okay.

857
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:58,620
So, uh...

858
00:30:59,280 --> 00:30:59,780
Press 2.

859
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,340
Oh, okay.

860
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,380
We're a win.

861
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,140
Oh, shit!

862
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:03,900
That's not what I wanted!

863
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,940
I wanted...

864
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,380
Okay.

865
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,280
We're a win.

866
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,000
Oh, okay.

867
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,100
I'm so dead.

868
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,700
Am I really going to die in tutorial?

869
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,820
Let's find out.

870
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:17,700
Let's...

871
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,640
Okay.

872
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,280
Let's heal.

873
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:20,840
All right.

874
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,220
Because I know like Dark and Darker didn't have gear-based matchmaking.

875
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,420
All right.

876
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:26,940
Nice.

877
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,760
We need that.

878
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,260
All right.

879
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,040
Spin to win.

880
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,380
Okay.

881
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,240
Shoes.

882
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,080
All right.

883
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,740
All right.

884
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,200
We're good.

885
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,000
We're okay.

886
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:38,920
Oh, what's this?

887
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:40,740
Okay.

888
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,160
Nothing.

889
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,620
What are they worshipping?

890
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,920
What is that?

891
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,040
The fuck were they worshipping right there?

892
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,500
Stupid goblins.

893
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,620
All right.

894
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,580
I am the goblin slayer.

895
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,720
I wonder how many smurfs...

896
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,980
Let's find out.

897
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,240
Okay.

898
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,120
Let's find out.

899
00:31:59,220 --> 00:31:59,820
Blocked it.

900
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,760
Shoot this.

901
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,380
Oh, shit.

902
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,120
He shot that.

903
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:04,960
Wait.

904
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,360
I thought I staggered it.

905
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,020
Okay.

906
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:07,620
Never mind.

907
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,320
I thought I actually staggered that.

908
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,480
So I was like, shoot this.

909
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:15,760
Okay.

910
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,020
Using my bandage.

911
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,450
I feel like everything will be okay.

912
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,350
Oh, okay.

913
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:28,750
That heals a lot actually.

914
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,450
I was not expecting that.

915
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,930
I wasn't expecting that to heal so much.

916
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,770
Am I in the right area?

917
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:34,130
Oh.

918
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:34,550
F.

919
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:36,330
F.

920
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:39,690
The shield looks fragile.

921
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,610
I mean, it's made out of wood.

922
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,230
Just spin?

923
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:46,710
Spin!

924
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:53,930
I heard some classes are like mega busted too.

925
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,390
So it'll be interesting.

926
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:56,190
All right, guys.

927
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:59,950
It's time to teach me which classes are super fucking busted.

928
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,570
Because it's like unbalanced as fuck.

929
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:07,910
Is there stuff in these?

930
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:09,350
Hello?

931
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,270
Chest open.

932
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,610
Is there anything here?

933
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:13,250
Ooh.

934
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:14,590
Nice.

935
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:15,830
I like that.

936
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:16,490
I like loot.

937
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,350
I like loot.

938
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,330
Give me the meta.

939
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:24,010
What is the meta?

940
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,150
I need to know.

941
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:27,550
Do I not have shoes on?

942
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:29,670
No, I do.

943
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:30,450
It just sounds weird.

944
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,870
It just sounds like I'm barefoot right now.

945
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,190
Is the wizard cracked?

946
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:35,910
Who are you?

947
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:37,890
Hello, concert.

948
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:39,190
Friendly?

949
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:40,350
Are you friendly?

950
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:40,730
Oh.

951
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,560
Can he open doors?

952
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,820
Oh, no, he can't.

953
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,380
Wait!

954
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,520
Can I cheese this?

955
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:01,640
Friendly?

956
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,820
Can I cheese this?

957
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,280
Hello?

958
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:09,640
Can I cheese this?

959
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:12,700
Hello?

960
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,140
Hello?

961
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:14,540
Hello?

962
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,620
Whoa.

963
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:20,840
Idiot.

964
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,780
Fucking idiot.

965
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,420
That's fucking right.

966
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,360
What you gonna do?

967
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,060
Nothing.

968
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,740
That's right.

969
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,020
Nothing.

970
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:30,920
Oh, wait!

971
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,760
That's right.

972
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,460
You can't do anything.

973
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,640
It's couldn't do anything.

974
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,400
Easiest game of my fuckin' life!

975
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,800
That's fucking great!

976
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,960
Can't even open doors!

977
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,200
You stupid fuck!

978
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:58,030
I don't need to learn anything!

979
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,370
I have a door!

980
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,390
That's right!

981
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,310
God didn't give you opposable thumbs!

982
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:08,230
What the fuck you gonna do?

983
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:09,590
Nothing!

984
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:14,690
Holy shit, that's so stupid!

985
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:17,310
How much HP do you have?!

986
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,750
Holy shit, I'm bringing a big boy!

987
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:22,550
Oh, this only works with the small, okay.

988
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:24,050
I'm bringing a big boy!

989
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:30,430
That's fucking right!

990
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:33,790
God didn't give you opposable thumbs!

991
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,850
Oh nice, he got a horse.

992
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:38,650
Nice, okay.

993
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,310
That was easy.

994
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,850
That was so fucking easy.

995
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,190
Holy shit.

996
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,650
And they say this game is hard?

997
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,290
I have doors!

998
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,190
Ooh, that's spooky.

999
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:57,450
This looks very spooky.

1000
00:35:59,470 --> 00:35:59,830
Whoa!

1001
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:02,770
Whoa.

1002
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:05,010
Is this the escape portal?

1003
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:08,790
What is?

1004
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:10,610
Bye!

1005
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:12,510
Goodbye!

1006
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:16,450
The shield in game, a door.

1007
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:21,850
Yay!

1008
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,890
Alright, who was...

1009
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,610
Okay, cryo, DK, and druid.

1010
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:28,630
Okay, but like, which was like...

1011
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,970
Okay, cryo, death knight?

1012
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,110
Holy shit.

1013
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,030
Cryo, DK, and druid.

1014
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:36,790
Wait, can I be a bear?

1015
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,130
Transform?

1016
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:39,870
I can be a panther?

1017
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:41,270
Panther?

1018
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:43,320
Panther?

1019
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,140
Wait, um, but like, in game.

1020
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:50,980
Okay.

1021
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,300
Oh, it is.

1022
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,960
Oh, cryo and..

1023
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,220
Wait, is that it?

1024
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,500
This is just panther?

1025
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,760
What if I wanna be a bear?

1026
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,220
Last seen.

1027
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,440
Someone's threat is designated.

1028
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,920
Promise for dealing shadow damage.

1029
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,740
I can't be a fucking bear?

1030
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,700
But like, Baldur's Gate taught me that druids can turn into bears.

1031
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,180
It's a bear!

1032
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,020
And then they can... fuck things.

1033
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:14,520
I don't...

1034
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,480
Okay, let's see.

1035
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,940
It will be dark.

1036
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,260
Okay, Death Knight looks cool.

1037
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:27,280
A terrifying warrior that strikes fear into enemies.

1038
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:31,360
And at close... wait, you didn't see the Baldur's Gate cutscene?

1039
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,380
The first thing they ever showed in Baldur's Gate...

1040
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,920
was when, like, that guy turned into a bear.

1041
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:41,360
And then the... the... the... the other... the main character was like...

1042
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:41,580
Whoa!

1043
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,400
And then, like, I... I was like, what the...

1044
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,560
I was literally the one... the only thing I know about Baldur's Gate.

1045
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,560
I was like...

1046
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,680
And the vampire guy.

1047
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,180
The emo vampire guy that everybody loves.

1048
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,180
And I'm like, what's so great about him?

1049
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,880
Why is it all skelly, guys?

1050
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,300
Why is it all skelly, boys?

1051
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,800
The fit... yeah, the bear form stays on.

1052
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,080
Hahahaha, hahaha!

1053
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,360
Hahahahahaha.

1054
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,600
Alright, let's see...

1055
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:19,740
Uhhhhhhh...

1056
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,640
You're right, he's not emo, he's a goth kid.

1057
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,200
The vampire guy is a goth kid.

1058
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,860
Alright, ummm...

1059
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:29,020
Spellcaster who constantly restricts and weakens enemies on the battlefield.

1060
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,460
When coordinate well with teammates they can create an advantage...

1061
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:32,960
advantages.

1062
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:39,720
And it has soul energy replenishing by killing creatures and absorbing their soul.

1063
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,020
AoE...

1064
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,160
I don't like that.

1065
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,100
I don't.

1066
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:47,720
Okay.

1067
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:15,520
Feeling a small amount that I'm pulling the target to you.

1068
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,280
Oh, it's this one!

1069
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,420
Fire a spectral hand at the target.

1070
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:28,600
I feel like if to do that, I actually have to be good at the game, so I'm going to get the soul shroud first.

1071
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,160
I feel like I actually have to be good at the video game to do this part.

1072
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,160
I can't believe it.

1073
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,640
It's only panther?

1074
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,680
There's no bear form?

1075
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,500
Okay.

1076
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:45,000
Sustained area damage to tournament nearby foes.

1077
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,120
Oh, I get both?

1078
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,340
Oh, there's E!

1079
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,440
Oh!

1080
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:50,740
Oh!

1081
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,460
This is all my abilities!

1082
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,440
Oh!

1083
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,240
I see.

1084
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,200
Okay.

1085
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,240
E, absorbing souls.

1086
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,420
One soul resists me.

1087
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,480
I have to kill an enemy, generates...

1088
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,020
Oh, okay.

1089
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,200
That's a lot of stuff.

1090
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,200
All right.

1091
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:10,660
I'm going to be good at this.

1092
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,340
This is going to be the death knight.

1093
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,580
It's like a homage to the bark knight.

1094
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,600
This will be a death knight.

1095
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:17,400
Okay.

1096
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,960
You think they'll be friendly?

1097
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,720
Damage relies on soul energy, lacks mobility.

1098
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,600
So I have to kill things to get soul energy.

1099
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,660
All right.

1100
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,100
Oh, my God.

1101
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:27,740
I can have hair!

1102
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,160
I don't like that.

1103
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,200
Oh, my God.

1104
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,540
It can be a balding...

1105
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,940
Oh, my God.

1106
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
That's so fucked.

1107
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,120
That's actually so fucked.

1108
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,640
Not only...

1109
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:40,640
Not only...

1110
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:45,620
Not only am I a death knight, but I'm a balding death knight.

1111
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,340
You know what?

1112
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:50,720
Yeah.

1113
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,560
I'll be a balding death knight.

1114
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:54,220
Ooh.

1115
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,500
A balding death knight that went through a phase.

1116
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,700
You want to know how I got these scars?

1117
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:01,600
Yeah.

1118
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,160
You know what?

1119
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:02,400

Oh, yes.

I guess I...

1127
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:23,140
Actually, do I want to have scars?

1128
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,560
Do I want to have scars?

1129
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,040
Nah, there's no scars.

1130
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,020
All right.

1131
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,080
Helmet?

1132
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,820

1133
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,240

1134
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:35,440
No.

00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,360
I want everybody to see my hair.

1136
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,440
Okay.

Wait, how many letters can I do?

1143
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:52,820
Five?

1144
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,920
Five to eleven.

1145
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,260
Okay, guys.

1146
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,400

00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,680
I don't need to know that.

1157
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,280
All right.

1158
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:26,880
Rest easy.

Wow.

1180
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,300

1181
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:06,540
Wow.

1182
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,340
New skills and nature event.

1183
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,120
There's so many things.

1184
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:12,700
Oh, I get it.

1185
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,500
I got, I got key potions!

1186
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,240
Okay.

1187
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,200
Yes, I'm the doker.

1188
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,660
It's that's me.

1189
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,860
I am the doker.

1190
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,900
I want to put my stuff away.

1191
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,180
Shop.

1192
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:35,520
Oh, oh, this is like actual shop shop.

1193
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,480
Oh, wait, that's cool.

1194
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:52,320
This looks like, this reminds me of Diablo, the new Diablo, the, not the new, sorry, the last Diablo game, with the cosmetics.

1195
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,280
The one who dokes.

1196
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:01,780
Yeah, trade.

1197
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,780
Okay, I'll beg for stuff later.

1198
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:11,920
I don't want to...

1199
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,240
I don't want to bring any potions.

1200
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,780
I feel like I can...

1201
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:25,560
If I lose an, you know what, I don't want to bring, if it's like SBMM, where it's based on the gear, I'm not gonna bring any gear.

1202
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,900
I'm not gonna bring any of my gear.

1203
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:30,380
That's fine.

1204
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:33,600
Let's see.

1205
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,180
Alright, now I'm naked.

1206
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,260
Alright, I'm gonna start, okay start.

1207
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:40,940
Casual...

1208
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:47,960
Casual, casual... okay, casual, casual, I guess this is rank, Mythril Order.

1209
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:50,880
Wait, what's that?

1210
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,500
Wait, actually, competitive.

1211
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:53,840
Wait, there's competitive?

1212
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,160
Uh, Mythril Order.

1213
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:03,260
Uh, what's does this mean?

1214
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,540
What's the Mythril Order?

1215
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,100
Because it's different from competitive.

1216
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,040
Let's see.

1217
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,280
You know what?

1218
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:12,620
I'm ready.

1219
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:13,660
Let's start.

00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,920
I've confirmed my loadout.

1222
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:17,460
I'm naked.

1223
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:22,120
Oh, it's like the ca- Oh, the cavern run!

00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,400
Settings.

1230
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,200
Okay, mouse, keyboard.

1231
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,980
Oh god, I need to adjust that.

1232
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:37,220
I hate that so much.

1233
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:37,580
Okay.

1234
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:38,740
Aiming method.

1235
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:39,360
Hold.

1236
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:40,240
Click.

1237
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:41,140
Hold.

1238
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:41,940
Click.

00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,360
Move forward.

WSD.

1241
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,240
Weapon set.

1242
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:47,920

1243
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:48,360
Okay.

1244
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:49,300
Nope.

1245
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:55,740
Okay, apparently you can't use mouse button.

1246
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:56,980
That's cool.

1247
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:02,120
Literally, the one thing I wanted and I can't use was your inventory.

1248
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:04,740
The fuck?

1249
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:05,260
You have nothing?

1250
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:11,370
Alright.

1251
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:13,530
It's dark and darker time.

1252
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:18,330
I'm dungeon-boarding it right now.

1253
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:19,470
I'm dungeon-boarding?

1254
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,110
I'm dungeon-boarding?

1255
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:25,110
Why am I- Did I literally spawn on top?

1256
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:27,270
Are you fucking kidding me?

1257
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:28,570
Are you fucking kidding me?

1258
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:32,670
Okay, apparently I spawned at- I spawned at the top.

1259
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:34,010
Alright.

1260
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:34,830
Ooh, pants.

1261
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:35,630
Ooh!

1262
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:37,330
Hello.

1263
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:41,270
How do I get down?

1264
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:44,850
Is that a person?

1265
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:48,250
Guys, I don't think they're friendly.

1266
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:50,990
How do I get down?

1267
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:54,350
How do I- How do I-

1268
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,000
Okay.

1269
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,180
Okay, this is fucked.

1270
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,880
This is actually fucked.

1271
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,240
Get down.

1272
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:09,580
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1273
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:10,480
Oh my god.

1274
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:11,960
We gotta get rid of the tentacles.

1275
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,180
Get down.

1276
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:15,640
Alright.

1277
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:17,240
Wait.

1278
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,040
My soul energy.

1279
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:18,900
I can use souls.

1280
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:19,900
Soul!

1281
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:22,560
I did it.

1282
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:24,800
Okay.

1283
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:26,680
Elixir.

1284
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:27,680
Alright.

1285
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:29,600
I already lost half my HP.

1286
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,320
That's cool.

1287
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,680
I'm doing my best.

1288
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,040
Whoa!

1289
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:38,560
I'm doing my best.

1290
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:40,240
Oh, I have shoes.

1291
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,660
I have shoes now.

1292
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:44,740
Oh!

1293
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,200
Let's see.

1294
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,500
Drink the elixirs first, but you can't- Oh.

1295
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:52,120
Uh...

1296
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,000
Which one is the elixirs?

1297
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,640
Is this- Which one is the elixir?

1298
00:47:58,340 --> 00:47:59,560
It's two elixir?

1299
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,060
I can't tell.

1300
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,380
Which colors are the elixirs?

1301
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,960
I want to take everything.

1302
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:10,280
Oh, okay.

1303
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,060
I drink.

1304
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:15,380
I drink.

1305
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:17,740
Whoa.

1306
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,200
Whoa!

1307
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:18,420
Whoa!

1308
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:18,740
Whoa!

1309
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:19,100
Whoa!

1310
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,080
Wha!

1311
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:25,750
I killed ghosts!

1312
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:29,270
You're a ghost!

1313
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:32,510
Why can I stab ghosts?

1314
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:35,030
Oh, God.

1315
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:36,390
Oh, God.

1316
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:38,250
That was spooky.

1317
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:40,710
Bro!

1318
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:42,590
I- That's it.

1319
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:42,950
I'm angry.

1320
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,370
Oh, I don't have enough souls.

1321
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:44,870
Never mind.

1322
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:45,710
I can't get angry.

1323
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:48,470
I can't get angry.

1324
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:49,830
Oh god.

1325
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:52,710
Okay, I'm understanding the patterns.

1326
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:54,630
Alright.

1327
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:56,450
We're figuring it out.

1328
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:57,290
Oh, it's a sphere.

1329
00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:00,470
Oh, they're all ghosts.

1330
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:02,810
Oh, I don't like this room.

1331
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:06,070
They're all ghosts.

1332
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:07,810
Whoa!

1333
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:08,550
Whoa!

1334
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:08,990
Okay.

1335
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:10,310
Wow!

1336
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:10,670
Wow!

1337
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:11,850
Wow!

1338
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:14,290
Wow!

1339
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:14,830
Wow!

1340
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:16,130
Wrong room!

1341
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:17,270
Wrong room!

1342
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,420
Oh my god!

1343
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,180
Okay.

1344
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,320
Get out of here.

1345
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,740
This is not the room I should have went to.

1346
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:29,300
Okay.

1347
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:30,600
Okay.

1348
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,420
There's a giant rat.

1349
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,180
Goodbye.

1350
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:35,700
Alright.

1351
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,300
Not going back there, that's for sure.

1352
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:39,480
Okay.

1353
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,860
That was the wrong room.

1354
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,480
Why is this scary?

1355
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,140
And then fucking dark and darker.

1356
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,820
How is this...

1357
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:50,520
How is there more monsters here?

1358
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:51,720
Alright.

1359
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:52,480
Doink.

1360
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,740
Are there any friendlies who want to be my friend?

1361
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,320
Anybody want to be my friend?

1362
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:00,800
Hello?

1363
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:03,220
Any friends?

1364
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,200
Hello?

1365
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:09,400
Oh.

1366
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,480
It looks like a...

1367
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,220
Are there any doors?

1368
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,520
Guys, I don't think he's friendly.

1369
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:19,300
Guys, I don't think he's friendly, guys.

1370
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:20,300
Guys, I don't...

1371
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:20,900
Wait.

1372
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:22,560
Can you go downstairs?

1373
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,160
Oh.

1374
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:26,560
Wait.

1375
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:27,480
I could cheese this.

1376
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:32,100
Oh.

1377
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:35,460
Oh.

1378
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:36,560
I cannot cheese this.

1379
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:37,260
He has a rock.

1380
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,480
He has a rock.

1381
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:38,960
I...

1382
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,300
I cannot cheese this.

1383
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:42,840
He has a rock.

1384
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:43,740
I...

1385
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,240
I don't want to piss up.

1386
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:45,920
I don't...

1387
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:47,780
I don't...

1388
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:50,200
I'm not gonna try and piss him off.

1389
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,220
He can throw rocks.

1390
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,240
Use paper dookie.

1391
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:56,800
Doki, use paper, guys.

1392
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,040
I'll open door.

1393
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:00,600
Door time.

1394
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,820
Hello Little Goblin.

1395
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:04,620
Where's your family?

1396
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:07,380
You'll never see your family!

1397
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,140
You'll never see... OH SHIT!

1398
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,820
You'll never see your family... OH SHIT!

1399
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,740
You'll never see your family again!

1400
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,200
That's fucking right.

1401
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:18,260
Alright.

1402
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,360
Grab some heals.

1403
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,360
Real quick.

1404
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:25,500
Alright, nice.

1405
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:26,640
Yay!

1406
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,020
Alright, more gold.

1407
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,260
Oh god, we're at the portal home.

1408
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:33,520
I wanna go home.

1409
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,680
I wanna go home.

1410
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,640
Close the door.

1411
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,140
Oh, hey there.

1412
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:43,820
Hello?

1413
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:45,680
Hello?

1414
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:49,280
Oh, I hear somebody.

1415
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:51,260
Hello?

1416
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:55,790
Is that...

1417
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:57,250
There's somebody else.

1418
00:51:57,450 --> 00:51:59,670
Oh my god, there's this guy that's killing everybody.

1419
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:01,910
Three escape portals have appeared.

1420
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:09,760
Oh, I can't put on anything.

1421
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,700
I'm gonna be naked.

1422
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:13,480
Oh.

1423
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,500
I'm scared.

1424
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:19,380
Okay.

1425
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:23,700
Wait, why can I...

1426
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,960
I hear somebody outside there.

1427
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:29,060
Oh.

1428
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:31,880
Okay.

1429
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:34,540
There has to be a portal near me.

1430
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:36,300
That's fucking right.

1431
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,080
You can't shoot this.

1432
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,020
Oh, you missed, bitch!

1433
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:40,640
That's fucking right!

1434
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,020
Alright.

1435
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,340
Killed your son and now I'll kill you.

1436
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:47,040
Alright, let's see.

1437
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:49,680
Oh, okay.

1438
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:52,920
Hello?

1439
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:58,150
Oh, there's so many portals.

1440
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:03,580
Oh no!

1441
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,040
The Resident Evil-ness!

1442
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:07,080
Okay.

1443
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,360
Where are the portals?

1444
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:13,260
Oh!

1445
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:15,160
Okay.

1446
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:16,460
Uh...

1447
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:19,180
Um...

1448
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,060
This is a thousand.

1449
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:24,340
Wait, I want a thousand.

1450
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:27,540
Ten...

1451
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:28,220
Okay.

1452
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,360
Math.

1453
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:30,840
Portal?

1454
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:32,600
Any portals?

1455
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:38,770
Where the fuck are the portals?

1456
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,840
Where the fuck are the portals?

1457
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:49,000
How can there be no portals near me?

1458
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:49,880
How can there be no portals near me?

1459
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:50,340
Oh, is there loot here?

1460
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:51,940
I already got that.

1461
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:58,380
Is there?

1462
00:53:59,260 --> 00:53:59,780
Hello?

1463
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:05,500
There's so many escape portals!

1464
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,840
But yeah, I don't know where they are!

1465
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:10,440
But yeah, I don't know where they are!

1466
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:13,870
Oh god.

1467
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:15,570
There has to be one near me.

1468
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:20,330
Is that an escape portal over there?

1469
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:20,730
Is that an escape portal over there?

1470
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:24,570
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

1471
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:26,430
Please, I don't wanna die!

1472
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:27,430
I don't wanna die!

1473
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:28,590
I don't wanna die!

1474
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:31,890
That's it!

1475
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:32,650
I'm angry!

1476
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:34,510
Sold!

1477
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:39,340
That's fucking right!

1478
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:40,300
Get sold!

1479
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,160
Alright, nice.

1480
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:44,080
That's good.

1481
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:45,720
You got sold.

1482
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,120
Is that a portal?

1483
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:50,280
Oh, is that it?

1484
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:51,800
Is that a portal?

1485
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:55,650
What the fuck is that?

1486
00:54:58,010 --> 00:54:59,170
I don't know what that is.

1487
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:04,270
What the fuck is that?

1488
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:05,550
I don't need pants.

1489
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:06,850
I want this.

1490
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:10,930
There's a blue circle?

1491
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:12,690
Guys, I'm blind!

1492
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:13,270
You know that!

1493
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:17,010
What's blue?

1494
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:24,150
Blue!

1495
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:29,090
Where the fuck is the color blue?

1496
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:33,970
Where the fuck is the color blue?

1497
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,440
I can't see!

1498
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,880
I'm stuck in this hallway!

1499
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:44,860
I've been going back and forth in this one goddamn hallway!

1500
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,160
I've been going back and forth in this one goddamn hallway!

1501
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:49,580
Oh!

1502
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:50,420
Oh!

1503
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,000
No, that's not blue enough.

1504
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:55,960
There's the rat.

1505
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:57,740
Maybe it's here.

1506
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:03,650
There's too many ghosts.

1507
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:05,090
I don't wanna deal with ghosts.

1508
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:07,010
Alright, I'm gonna go this way.

1509
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:10,230
The only enemy there is...

1510
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:10,990
Oh, I should drink this.

1511
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:12,450
I'm gonna drink this.

1512
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:14,910
And I'm gonna drink this.

1513
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:20,030
I have no idea if this will help me.

1514
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:26,030
That's fucking right.

1515
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:26,730
What you gonna do?

1516
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:27,270
Shoot me?

1517
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:29,370
That's fucking right.

1518
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:29,870
You missed.

1519
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:31,530
I'm angry.

1520
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:33,270
I can't find blue.

1521
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:34,890
That's right.

1522
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:36,770
You have no rights.

1523
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:38,250
You're a goblin.

1524
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:39,850
Alright, let's see.

1525
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:43,650
Oh, did they hear that?

1526
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:47,230
Am I like literally the only person left alive?

1527
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:51,530
Oh hey!

1528
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:53,230
I get pants now!

1529
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:54,770
Yippee!

1530
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:58,010
I have pants!

1531
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:00,390
Oh.

1532
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:03,780
Oh.

1533
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:07,940
Oh, he killed so many people.

1534
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:09,600
Woah!

1535
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:10,220
Woah!

1536
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:10,920
Fun Friendly!

1537
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:11,320
Please!

1538
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,340
Please don't...

1539
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:20,580
Oh my god, there's somebody behind me!

1540
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,540
Oh my god, there's somebody behind me!

1541
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:23,220
Oh!

1542
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:26,380
Please!

1543
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:30,320
I'm scared!

1544
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,520
I just wanna leave!

1545
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:34,960
Okay.

1546
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:35,820
Okay.

1547
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:38,940
Oh, come on!

1548
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:51,180
Oh, fuck!

1549
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:52,620
That's a rat!

1550
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,400
That's multiple!

1551
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,000
This is where I die!

1552
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,610
This is where I die, rats!

1553
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:02,510
Oh!

1554
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:03,010
Oh!

1555
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:11,190
Oh shit!

1556
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:14,210
Too many rats!

1557
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:18,370
Leave me alone!

1558
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:22,050
The blood moon is rising!

1559
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:23,170
Wait!

1560
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:29,190
I see so many!

1561
00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:30,750
I can't leave!

1562
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:36,430
Oh my god!

1563
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:36,750
Please!

1564
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:38,610
No!

1565
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:40,790
Please!

1566
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:42,830
I just wanna leave!

1567
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:44,790
Don't hurt me!

1568
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:47,190
There's so many rats!

1569
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:51,210
Please!

1570
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:52,530
Please!

1571
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:54,370
No!

1572
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:55,470
You fucker!

1573
00:58:55,590 --> 00:58:57,010
You're so mean!

1574
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:00,550
Oh my god!

1575
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:01,910
I hate you!

1576
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:03,650
I hate you!

1577
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:09,110
You...

1578
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:13,490
I hope you never find me in Ducking Portal!

1579
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:19,790
I...

1580
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:20,590
I...

1581
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:20,970
I...

1582
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:22,190
I've got the fucking...

1583
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:24,010
There were so many rats!

1584
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:26,890
I got so...

1585
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:27,530
I...

1586
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:30,810
I can't...

1587
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:33,040
Where are the portals?!

1588
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:37,970
Where are the portals?!

1589
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:38,610
Where are the portals?!

1590
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:39,010
Where are the portals?!

1591
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:40,350
I...

1592
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:42,730
I can't... couldn't find any portals!

1593
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:44,070
I...

1594
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:45,890
Where the fuck...

1595
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:47,350
I...

1596
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:50,090
I actually was begging...

1597
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:52,790
I was screaming in my...

1598
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:53,430
Stop!

1599
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:56,850
I...

1600
00:59:56,850 --> 00:59:57,550
I...

1601
00:59:57,550 --> 01:00:01,170
Every time I tried to go to a new area...

1602
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:02,830
It was just rats!

1603
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:05,170
It was just rats!

1604
01:00:06,490 --> 01:00:08,010
It was just rats!

1605
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:10,470
Where's the portal?

1606
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:11,670
How is he finding...

1607
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:12,350
Okay, I need to know...

1608
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:13,950
I need to know if he finds a portal...

1609
01:00:13,950 --> 01:00:17,450
I need to know...

1610
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:20,250
I need to know if he finds a portal...

1611
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:21,450
If he'll die...

1612
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:23,490
Are you fucking kidding me?!

1613
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:25,210
There's a portal right there!

1614
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:26,950
That's not fair!

1615
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:29,090
That's actually not...

1616
01:00:29,350 --> 01:00:31,630
How does he find a portal?!

1617
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:32,130
I...

1618
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:34,690
I couldn't find a portal anywhere!

1619
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:39,670
And there's two...

1620
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:41,790
And there's two portals!

1621
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:43,950
This is absolutely bullshit!

1622
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:46,100
This is absolutely bullshit!

1623
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:48,030
This is absolutely bullshit!

1624
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:49,710
Everything doesn't...

1625
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:50,870
go for Doki!

1626
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:52,150
And...

1627
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:55,750
Nothing ever...

1628
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:56,990
goes for Doki!

1629
01:00:57,330 --> 01:00:59,590
This is why I got those cars!

1630
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:00,710
This is...

1631
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:01,730
exactly why!

1632
01:01:02,670 --> 01:01:04,610
This is already...

1633
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:08,730
This is how I got these cars!

1634
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:09,650
...

1635
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:29,430
I can't believe it.

1636
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:32,130
How does he not find the rats?

1637
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:34,510
Why do I find rats?

1638
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:36,210
This is not fair!

1639
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:42,590
Oh my god, Chaney, thank you for the super chat.

1640
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:43,450
Thank you, thank you.

1641
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:45,670
The rat king has been slain.

1642
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:48,070
This is actually bullshit!

1643
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:50,830
This is so bullshit!

1644
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:53,430
I found every rat possible!

1645
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:56,510
This is not fair.

1646
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:04,490
I even... I even... I even tried to talk to them.

1647
01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:06,670
They didn't even care!

1648
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:10,330
They didn't even care.

1649
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:13,750
I was begging for my life.

1650
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:23,170
I was... voice chat is team only?

1651
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:26,410
Wait, I can't even beg for my life?

1652
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:31,830
That's... Approximity voice is what makes it so fun.

1653
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:34,030
Oh my god.

1654
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:36,650
I can't even beg for my life.

1655
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:40,850
That's why he ignored me.

1656
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:47,390
I was like, please spare me, concert.

1657
01:02:48,290 --> 01:02:50,450
I can't believe it.

1658
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:54,430
I begged for my life but it didn't even matter.

1659
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:57,730
It didn't even fucking matter.

1660
01:02:57,990 --> 01:03:00,070
Nobody heard me.

1661
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:06,110
I cried into the void and the void did not care.

1662
01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:10,270
Oh my god.

1663
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:14,790
That's why I didn't hit back!

1664
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:19,930
I thought... I thought... I thought he was just an asshole.

1665
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:24,450
I was begging for my life.

1666
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:26,750
I thought he was an asshole.

1667
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:28,630
He just was good in here.

1668
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:31,110
Okay.

1669
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:32,990
Alright.

1670
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:34,830
It's fine.

1671
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:36,510
Everything is fine.

1672
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:40,190
Alright.

1673
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:40,950
Here we go.

1674
01:03:42,530 --> 01:03:43,790
Everything... Oh shit!

1675
01:03:46,210 --> 01:03:48,110
I don't wanna fight the rats.

1676
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:52,350
Oh my god.

1677
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:54,190
Don't let the rats get me.

1678
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:56,470
Don't let them get me.

1679
01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:57,350
Alright.

1680
01:03:58,810 --> 01:03:59,370
Okay.

1681
01:04:00,730 --> 01:04:01,630
Here we go.

1682
01:04:02,890 --> 01:04:03,750
It's fine.

1683
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:05,230
Everything is fine.

1684
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:07,870
Everything is fine.

1685
01:04:07,930 --> 01:04:09,070
Maybe I'll be friends.

1686
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:12,550
Alright.

1687
01:04:12,670 --> 01:04:14,150
I don't... Not this way.

1688
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:18,110
Maybe there will be people who want to be my friend.

1689
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:19,330
You know?

1690
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:21,330
That's the great thing about multiplayer.

1691
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:22,610
Right?

1692
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:24,950
Alright.

1693
01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:28,250
Let's see.

1694
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:30,190
Get this elixir in.

1695
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:30,770
Oh!

1696
01:04:30,790 --> 01:04:31,850
Look at all this loot!

1697
01:04:32,350 --> 01:04:34,050
I can't wait to...

1698
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:37,890
I can't wait to give this loot to the first person that kills me!

1699
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:41,950
What?

1700
01:04:43,090 --> 01:04:44,290
Did you guys hear that?

1701
01:04:47,310 --> 01:04:48,610
Did you guys hear that?

1702
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:52,510
This is third party time.

1703
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:00,070
Hello.

1704
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:02,390
Oh my god!

1705
01:05:04,930 --> 01:05:05,950
That's fucking right!

1706
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:06,750
I'm coming in!

1707
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:08,550
That's right!

1708
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:10,710
Oh my god!

1709
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:12,070
He's turning into a pet thing!

1710
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,200
Fuck you!

1711
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:27,540
Alright.

1712
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:29,400
Let's steal his loot.

1713
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:32,120
Secure my loot now, bitch.

1714
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,660
My loot now.

1715
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:37,260
Thanks for killing them, you loser.

1716
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:38,040
.

1717
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:43,820
Let's see.

1718
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:46,380
Yippee.

1719
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:49,140
Yippee.

1720
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:51,940
Oh, you want a round too?

1721
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:52,840
Fucking hell.

1722
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,660
You want a round too?

1723
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:56,740
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1724
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:57,280
Friendly?

1725
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:58,080
Friendly?

1726
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:58,900
Oh, he's not friendly!

1727
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,540
He's not friendly!

1728
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:02,520
Whoa!

1729
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:03,600
Friendly?

1730
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:06,950
Okay.

1731
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:08,090
Alright, let's go.

1732
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:08,630
Woo!

1733
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:09,990
.

1734
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:14,970
And that's how we became best friends.

1735
01:06:17,450 --> 01:06:17,970
Woo!

1736
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:23,250
That's how we became good friends!

1737
01:06:25,490 --> 01:06:26,630
You go, Panther!

1738
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:27,450
You go!

1739
01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:29,690
Alright.

1740
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:33,930
There's no way, there's no way he'd kill me.

1741
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:35,750
He killed the rats!

1742
01:06:38,090 --> 01:06:39,550
He killed the fucking rats!

1743
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:40,170
There's no way!

1744
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:44,090
Whoa!

1745
01:06:44,090 --> 01:06:44,830
Yeah, that's right.

1746
01:06:44,850 --> 01:06:45,810
Beat the shit out of you.

1747
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:47,830
What's he gonna do?

1748
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:50,070
Stab me now that...

1749
01:06:50,070 --> 01:06:50,750
Whoa!

1750
01:06:50,910 --> 01:06:51,790
Look at him go!

1751
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:53,590
Wait, he's so strong!

1752
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:56,610
Holy shit!

1753
01:06:57,270 --> 01:06:59,210
It's like he knows what he's doing!

1754
01:07:02,170 --> 01:07:02,650
Nice.

1755
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:03,670
My loot now.

1756
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:05,490
Guys, we have to work together.

1757
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:08,650
Oh, I hate Resident Evil-ing this.

1758
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:10,510
Okay.

1759
01:07:11,950 --> 01:07:14,590
Uh... Oh my god.

1760
01:07:14,670 --> 01:07:15,570
I hate this.

1761
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:17,930
I hate trying to Resident Evil this.

1762
01:07:18,590 --> 01:07:21,050
Alright, yeah!

1763
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:22,510
Go, guy!

1764
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:22,890
Go!

1765
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:24,850
You got this!

1766
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:26,850
I believe in you.

1767
01:07:28,270 --> 01:07:28,910
Yippee!

1768
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,850
Oh, look at this loot!

1769
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:34,990
Alright...

1770
01:07:37,350 --> 01:07:38,570
Look at that, I made it.

1771
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:40,670
We're best friends after I tried to kill him.

1772
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:42,990
Now we're best friends.

1773
01:07:43,150 --> 01:07:43,830
Oh, shoulder.

1774
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:44,590
Good.

1775
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:46,450
Alright, let's see.

1776
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:47,450
Where do I have to go?

1777
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:48,330
He's got this!

1778
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:49,790
Look, he's a fucking panther!

1779
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:50,830
Look at him go!

1780
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:54,110
Oh my god, he's so smart!

1781
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:08,750
Oh my god, he's so good at this game.

1782
01:08:12,870 --> 01:08:13,730
I'll let him see.

1783
01:08:13,790 --> 01:08:14,490
I'll let him have that.

1784
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:16,310
See, I'm a good pro.

1785
01:08:16,390 --> 01:08:17,710
Oh, he's gonna let me have that?

1786
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:19,610
Nice.

1787
01:08:20,890 --> 01:08:22,470
Oh, let's open this chest.

1788
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:24,090
Guys, guys, guys.

1789
01:08:24,110 --> 01:08:25,130
This game is so easy.

1790
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:32,320
Go, furry, go!

1791
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:33,980
You got this!

1792
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:36,880
What a guy.

1793
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:37,940
Don't worry, I'll give you light!

1794
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:40,000
Look at that!

1795
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:42,180
I gave you light!

1796
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:45,660
This is like my pet cat.

1797
01:08:48,780 --> 01:08:50,760
Oh shit, there's also a mimic.

1798
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:53,960
Whoa!

1799
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:54,440
Whoa!

1800
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:55,520
What?

1801
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:56,120
What did you mean?

1802
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:57,060
You brought him over!

1803
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:01,480
Oh wait, there's a chest!

1804
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:03,080
Alright.

1805
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:05,240
Let's see.

1806
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:06,440
What the fuck?

1807
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,020
What the fuck is going on here?

1808
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:11,320
Alright.

1809
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:13,460
I think I have enough loot.

1810
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:15,640
Alright, it's time to find our escape portal.

1811
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:20,540
It's time to find our escape portal, guys.

1812
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:22,260
Ooh, gloves.

1813
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,140
Oh, I don't have enough inventory.

1814
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:25,960
Okay, we don't need this.

1815
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:27,360
This is clearly bad.

1816
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:29,360
500 gold?

1817
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:31,760
Holy shit, I'm rich!

1818
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:34,580
Alright, let me grab my torch.

1819
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:35,700
Alright.

1820
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:37,980
We gotta find our escape portal.

1821
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:41,120
Wait, there's something over here.

1822
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:41,680
What's this?

1823
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:45,520
Oh, it's like a resurrection stone?

1824
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:47,480
The fuck is that?

1825
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:50,520
We're so rich, man.

1826
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:52,720
Okay.

1827
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:55,440
We gotta find...

1828
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:58,400
We gotta find a way to leave.

1829
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:00,760
Okay, let's get rid of him.

1830
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,780
I'm contribu- Wait, that's a rat!

1831
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:07,460
Okay, let's get him out of here first.

1832
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:10,380
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1833
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:11,280
Oh shit!

1834
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:14,900
That's fucking right.

1835
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:16,460
What's he gonna do?

1836
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:17,100
Hit me?

1837
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:19,160
Wait, where's my buddy?

1838
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:21,620
Wait a minute, where's the buddy?

1839
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:23,060
Where'd the buddy go?

1840
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:25,160
Where'd the buddy go?

1841
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:27,560
Wait, I'm alone!

1842
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:33,790
Holy shit!

1843
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:36,550
Alright.

1844
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:38,730
See, I told you, he would never betray me.

1845
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:42,490
Oh, let's get him out of the way.

1846
01:10:44,830 --> 01:10:45,930
Alright, we're fine.

1847
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:49,890
See, everything is- Bro, look at those dodges!

1848
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:54,430
Holy shit, he's actually caving!

1849
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:57,370
What the fuck are those dodges?

1850
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:00,530
Alright, let's see.

1851
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:01,690
Let's grab a silver.

1852
01:11:02,010 --> 01:11:03,770
Where the fuck are the portals?

1853
01:11:03,770 --> 01:11:04,830
It says two...

1854
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:07,130
Two, three, four portals.

1855
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:09,510
Alright.

1856
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:12,730
Are there any portals anywhere?

1857
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:16,730
What a gamer!

1858
01:11:16,990 --> 01:11:19,170
Guys, why did I not be a druid?

1859
01:11:19,330 --> 01:11:21,210
Did you not see the moves he did?

1860
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:23,650
That shit was insane!

1861
01:11:25,930 --> 01:11:27,370
That shit was crazy!

1862
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:30,370
He's a- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1863
01:11:31,710 --> 01:11:32,450
Crazy guy.

1864
01:11:32,770 --> 01:11:33,210
Whoa!

1865
01:11:34,550 --> 01:11:35,030
Okay.

1866
01:11:36,270 --> 01:11:37,290
Alright, there's more!

1867
01:11:38,270 --> 01:11:39,390
There's more for you!

1868
01:11:42,490 --> 01:11:43,190
Don't worry!

1869
01:11:43,630 --> 01:11:44,530
You got this!

1870
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:48,770
Oh, that's a lot more!

1871
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:49,790
That's a lot more!

1872
01:11:50,590 --> 01:11:53,150
Don't worry, I have more people for you, druid!

1873
01:11:56,950 --> 01:11:58,290
Don't worry, druid!

1874
01:11:58,410 --> 01:11:58,430
Don't worry, druid!

1875
01:11:58,610 --> 01:11:59,570
There's more!

1876
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:04,450
Okay, there has to be a portal here...

1877
01:12:04,450 --> 01:12:07,350
Please, I just want one portal!

1878
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:11,170
Oh, this is where I- Like, where I first spawned in.

1879
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:14,370
Where the fuck are the portals?

1880
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:16,010
I swear...

1881
01:12:16,010 --> 01:12:17,730
Oh, I brought more!

1882
01:12:19,230 --> 01:12:21,110
You got this, druid!

1883
01:12:21,730 --> 01:12:23,130
You're so good at this!

1884
01:12:29,370 --> 01:12:30,990
I'm so efficient!

1885
01:12:32,210 --> 01:12:34,150
You got this, buddy!

1886
01:12:35,130 --> 01:12:36,450
All right, bye.

1887
01:12:41,330 --> 01:12:43,850
I didn't find a portal first!

1888
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:46,970
The portal is number one priority.

1889
01:12:48,610 --> 01:12:49,730
It'll be fine.

1890
01:12:49,850 --> 01:12:50,550
Look at him.

1891
01:12:50,710 --> 01:12:51,190
See?

1892
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:52,310
Look at him go.

1893
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:54,390
See?

1894
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:55,150
He's fine.

1895
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:55,910
He's alive.

1896
01:12:57,930 --> 01:12:59,490
Maybe there's a portal here.

1897
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:03,400
See?

1898
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:04,440
I'm contributing.

1899
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:08,180
You said I'm not contributing.

1900
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,800
A shadow portal!

1901
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:13,860
Is that the portal that goes like deep down?

1902
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:19,340
Druid!

1903
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:20,220
Druid!

1904
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:21,880
Druid.

1905
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:23,660
Druid!

1906
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:24,800
Druid, get over here!

1907
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:26,200
Wait, is my druid dead?

1908
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:30,940
Druid?

1909
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:33,900
Druid?

1910
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:36,660
Whoa!

1911
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:44,020
Druid, get over here!

1912
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:51,980
Druid!

1913
01:13:57,700 --> 01:13:58,900
Druid, go aggro!

1914
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:02,020
Yeah, you got this, Druid!

1915
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:03,880
Alright.

1916
01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:10,210
Whoa!

1917
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:15,400
Druid, keep aggroing!

1918
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:16,320
I believe in you!

1919
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:20,860
Druid, there's this other guy!

1920
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:23,580
Whoa!

1921
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:28,120
Boy!

1922
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:32,200
One more!

1923
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:33,240
One more!

1924
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:33,840
Okay.

1925
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:46,060
Yippee!

1926
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:57,360
Alright.

1927
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:58,620
Tyrone Kitty.

1928
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,000
Thanks, Matt.

1929
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:01,940
Stop!

1930
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:10,770
Is he gonna find the exit?

1931
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:11,650
Is he?

1932
01:15:11,810 --> 01:15:13,430
Of course I left it.

1933
01:15:13,470 --> 01:15:14,170
What the fuck?

1934
01:15:19,670 --> 01:15:21,110
He's late to take.

1935
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:23,210
Look, I am like the moral support.

1936
01:15:23,730 --> 01:15:26,030
Look, he's literally full HP!

1937
01:15:27,710 --> 01:15:30,370
He's literally full HP.

1938
01:15:33,110 --> 01:15:34,250
He's fine!

1939
01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:37,090
I've escaped.

1940
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:39,070
That's all that matters.

1941
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:44,030
I should have stalled until like...

1942
01:15:44,030 --> 01:15:45,050
What the fuck?

1943
01:15:45,070 --> 01:15:46,030
How did he know?

1944
01:15:46,430 --> 01:15:47,930
How did he ins...

1945
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:51,380
That's fucked!

1946
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:53,320
No, I should have baited him.

1947
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:57,060
I should have waited until like 30 seconds left or some shit.

1948
01:15:57,180 --> 01:15:59,040
And then took the portal.

1949
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:02,620
And...

1950
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:02,780
And...

1951
01:16:02,780 --> 01:16:03,120
And...

1952
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:04,340
And...

1953
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:08,300
I should have done that.

1954
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:10,620
Just to see what happens.

1955
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:12,620
Oh my god.

1956
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:13,700
There's Moose?

1957
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:15,560
How is there...

1958
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:15,800
What...

1959
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:17,980
What does the Moose do?

1960
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:21,960
Oh my god.

1961
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:25,380
What the... How does he still have inventory space?

1962
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:30,950
Are the Moose...

1963
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:32,050
Are the Meese...

1964
01:16:32,530 --> 01:16:33,330
You guys didn't know.

1965
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:35,890
Um, Meese is like the plural form of Moose.

1966
01:16:36,030 --> 01:16:38,010
Are the... Are the Meese like...

1967
01:16:39,050 --> 01:16:40,670
Wait, they're evil Meese?

1968
01:16:40,790 --> 01:16:41,910
They're evil Moose?

1969
01:16:42,870 --> 01:16:44,670
They're like evil Moose.

1970
01:16:46,110 --> 01:16:47,630
How does he still have...

1971
01:16:47,630 --> 01:16:49,110
Wait, there's werewolves?

1972
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:51,850
Wait, fight the werewolves, Tyrone!

1973
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:53,390
Tyrone, do it!

1974
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:55,490
Fight the werewolves!

1975
01:16:56,490 --> 01:16:58,190
Or are you a little bitch?

1976
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:02,310
Little... Little bitches don't...

1977
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:04,470
Little bitches can fight werewolves.

1978
01:17:04,490 --> 01:17:04,990
Come on!

1979
01:17:05,130 --> 01:17:06,350
That's right, Tyrone!

1980
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:08,390
Fight the werewolves!

1981
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:09,710
Don't be a little bitch!

1982
01:17:10,690 --> 01:17:11,610
That's fucking...

1983
01:17:11,610 --> 01:17:12,630
Oh shit!

1984
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:14,550
That's fucking right!

1985
01:17:15,310 --> 01:17:16,710
Yeah, 2v1 him!

1986
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:17,350
Yeah!

1987
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:21,730
Actually, it's Moosey.

1988
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:24,130
Come on, Tyrone!

1989
01:17:24,490 --> 01:17:25,650
You got this!

1990
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:28,270
Use your panther powers!

1991
01:17:29,050 --> 01:17:30,730
Watch out for the were...

1992
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:32,170
Are you running like a little bitch?

1993
01:17:32,170 --> 01:17:32,730
Tyrone!

1994
01:17:33,030 --> 01:17:34,350
Come on, Tyrone!

1995
01:17:35,010 --> 01:17:35,570
Oh!

1996
01:17:36,270 --> 01:17:37,930
Can't even kill...

1997
01:17:37,930 --> 01:17:38,610
Oh shit!

1998
01:17:39,010 --> 01:17:41,090
Can't even kill a werewolf.

1999
01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:45,710
Alright.

2000
01:17:46,770 --> 01:17:47,450
Wow.

2001
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:48,610
Guys.

2002
01:17:49,390 --> 01:17:50,910
That was an easy game.

2003
01:17:51,010 --> 01:17:51,730
Holy shit.

2004
01:17:51,970 --> 01:17:53,490
Maybe I am a gamer.

2005
01:17:54,090 --> 01:17:54,770
Maybe...

2006
01:17:55,870 --> 01:17:56,550
Maybe...

2007
01:17:56,930 --> 01:17:58,770
Maybe I am a gamer, chat.

2008
01:17:59,010 --> 01:17:59,890
I don't know.

2009
01:18:00,230 --> 01:18:00,910
I...

2010
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:02,250
I don't know.

2011
01:18:02,650 --> 01:18:04,670
I feel like a gamer just then.

2012
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:05,210
Alright.

2013
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:05,950
We can sell this.

2014
01:18:06,190 --> 01:18:06,750
Leather.

2015
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:07,270
Leather.

2016
01:18:07,890 --> 01:18:08,450
Orb.

2017
01:18:09,470 --> 01:18:10,850
What do I do with...

2018
01:18:10,850 --> 01:18:11,090
Okay.

2019
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:12,070
Uh...

2020
01:18:12,070 --> 01:18:12,350
Oh!

2021
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:14,170
I can craft consumables.

2022
01:18:14,330 --> 01:18:14,610
Oh!

2023
01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:17,410
Sell.

2024
01:18:17,490 --> 01:18:17,810
Sell.

2025
01:18:20,150 --> 01:18:21,070
Plus will.

2026
01:18:22,770 --> 01:18:23,330
Uh...

2027
01:18:24,290 --> 01:18:24,850
Sell.

2028
01:18:24,970 --> 01:18:25,270
Sell.

2029
01:18:26,850 --> 01:18:27,410
Oh!

2030
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:27,770
Okay.

2031
01:18:28,230 --> 01:18:29,950
Is that better than what I have?

2032
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:30,890
Yeah.

2033
01:18:32,730 --> 01:18:33,250
Okay.

2034
01:18:33,270 --> 01:18:33,830
That's blue.

2035
01:18:34,270 --> 01:18:36,350
And then I'll sell these two.

2036
01:18:37,230 --> 01:18:37,750
Alright.

2037
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:39,190
And then grow...

2038
01:18:39,190 --> 01:18:39,350
Alright.

2039
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:40,610
Let's put some stuff away.

2040
01:18:41,670 --> 01:18:42,190
Eh...

2041
01:18:42,190 --> 01:18:43,270
We can sell it.

2042
01:18:43,470 --> 01:18:43,930
Alright.

2043
01:18:44,070 --> 01:18:44,590
Nice.

2044
01:18:45,190 --> 01:18:46,530
How do I make...

2045
01:18:46,530 --> 01:18:46,710
Oh!

2046
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:48,650
I can get 20 for free?

2047
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:49,290
Wait.

2048
01:18:49,330 --> 01:18:49,950
We don't need that.

2049
01:18:51,130 --> 01:18:51,650
Uh...

2050
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:53,650
Let's grab...

2051
01:18:53,650 --> 01:18:53,710
Oh!

2052
01:18:53,730 --> 01:18:54,950
We can make healing potions!

2053
01:18:54,950 --> 01:18:55,550
Let's go.

2054
01:18:56,130 --> 01:18:56,850
I might...

2055
01:18:56,850 --> 01:18:57,770
Might as well.

2056
01:19:00,350 --> 01:19:00,870

I have Tyrone balling.

2202
01:26:43,850 --> 01:26:45,830
He's gonna ball with me.

2203
01:26:46,210 --> 01:26:46,930
Alright.

Come on, Tyrone.

2206
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:51,390
We don't need him.

2207
01:26:51,390 --> 01:26:53,830
We don't need him.

2208
01:26:53,970 --> 01:26:56,890
I've perfected the way of all Tyrones.

2209
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:59,230
Alright, Tyrone.

2210
01:26:59,350 --> 01:27:00,910

01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:02,790
You and I!

2212
01:27:03,030 --> 01:27:04,330
We are a team!

2213
01:27:05,230 --> 01:27:06,770
Tyrone the champion!

2214
01:27:07,450 --> 01:27:08,910
We'll show them!

2215
01:27:09,370 --> 01:27:11,290
We'll show the Dowdies!

2216
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:15,830
He mastered all elements of Tyrone.

2217
01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:22,310
Oh my god.

2218
01:27:22,310 --> 01:27:24,250
With the power of Tyrone.

2219
01:27:25,230 --> 01:27:27,570
Nobody can stop us now.

2220
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:31,070
Are we really the only people in this lobby, Tyrone?

2221
01:27:31,410 --> 01:27:32,850
Wait, it's two out of fifteen.

2222
01:27:32,950 --> 01:27:34,010
Where are the other adventurers?

2223
01:27:34,150 --> 01:27:36,490
Tyrone, we're gonna fucking kill all the other adventurers.

2224
01:27:37,370 --> 01:27:38,810
Tyrone be balling.

2225
01:27:38,970 --> 01:27:40,990
Wait, it's just me and Tyrone!

2226
01:27:42,450 --> 01:27:43,770
There's no other babies?

2227
01:27:44,410 --> 01:27:45,510
The fable.

2228
01:27:45,710 --> 01:27:47,250
The last Tyrone.

2229
01:27:47,970 --> 01:27:48,530
Hahaha.

2230
01:27:52,050 --> 01:27:53,370
Don't worry, Tyrone.

2231
01:27:54,070 --> 01:27:55,230
We'll show them.

2232
01:27:55,390 --> 01:27:56,870
We'll show those Dowdies.

2233
01:27:57,530 --> 01:27:58,690
Me and you.

2234
01:27:59,350 --> 01:28:00,910
Me and the last Tyrone.

2235
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:03,190
The last Tyrone bender.

2236
01:28:04,490 --> 01:28:06,330
You could've had a third.

2237
01:28:07,690 --> 01:28:09,990
No, that guy was a coward.

2238
01:28:10,130 --> 01:28:11,430
He didn't go on his main.

2239
01:28:11,570 --> 01:28:12,090
That's right.

2240
01:28:12,150 --> 01:28:13,730
Couldn't even snipe me.

2241
01:28:14,270 --> 01:28:17,250
If you were on your main, you could've gotten on this lobby.

2242
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:19,510
They're all scared of Tyrone.

2243
01:28:19,950 --> 01:28:21,250
Oh my god, Tyrone!

2244
01:28:21,490 --> 01:28:23,610
We're gonna be so jacked.

2245
01:28:23,670 --> 01:28:25,450
We're gonna have so much stuff.

2246
01:28:25,650 --> 01:28:27,610
This entire lobby is just you and I.

2247
01:28:28,550 --> 01:28:30,910
I don't believe him.

2248
01:28:32,650 --> 01:28:33,730
Oh my god.

2249
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:35,990
Wait, it's literally just you and I, Tyrone.

2250
01:28:36,390 --> 01:28:37,670
Oh my god.

2251
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:41,250
Does nobody have the inventory that I have?

2252
01:28:41,610 --> 01:28:43,390
A pretty good inventory.

2253
01:28:45,330 --> 01:28:47,110
A pretty good inventory.

2254
01:28:48,070 --> 01:28:50,050
There's less players and duos.

2255
01:28:50,150 --> 01:28:51,610
There's people with less friends.

2256
01:28:52,110 --> 01:28:52,590
Tyrone!

2257
01:28:54,410 --> 01:28:56,010
Look at these people with...

2258
01:28:56,010 --> 01:28:56,190
Oh.

2259
01:28:56,310 --> 01:28:56,650
Oh.

2260
01:28:57,710 --> 01:28:58,190
Oh.

2261
01:28:58,730 --> 01:29:00,130
Oh my god, it's a 2v2.

2262
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:01,450
Tyrone, you got this, right?

2263
01:29:01,710 --> 01:29:03,930
You can 1v2, right, Tyrone?

2264
01:29:04,550 --> 01:29:05,030
Right?

2265
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:08,150
Can I hurt my friend?

2266
01:29:08,410 --> 01:29:09,210
Wait, I can, right?

2267
01:29:09,810 --> 01:29:10,910
Is there friendly fire?

2268
01:29:12,070 --> 01:29:13,290
Oh no, Tyrone.

2269
01:29:13,350 --> 01:29:14,570
It's us against the world.

2270
01:29:15,290 --> 01:29:15,770
1v2.

2271
01:29:17,050 --> 01:29:17,570
1v3.

2272
01:29:19,050 --> 01:29:20,950
Wait, is there friendly fire?

2273
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:22,430
Wait, is there?

2274
01:29:22,770 --> 01:29:25,290
Is there 1v3?

2275
01:29:25,670 --> 01:29:26,590
Wait, yes?

2276
01:29:26,950 --> 01:29:28,190
Oh, okay.

2277
01:29:28,810 --> 01:29:29,730
Okay, Tyrone.

2278
01:29:29,790 --> 01:29:31,390
We might be 1v3-ing.

2279
01:29:31,470 --> 01:29:32,430
Alright, Tyrone, we got this.

2280
01:29:33,050 --> 01:29:33,570
Tyrone.

2281
01:29:33,830 --> 01:29:34,570
You and I.

2282
01:29:36,390 --> 01:29:38,270
Those fuckers won't know what hit them.

2283
01:29:39,390 --> 01:29:40,510
We got this.

2284
01:29:41,110 --> 01:29:41,630
Oh.

2285
01:29:43,210 --> 01:29:44,530
I'll never die.

2286
01:29:47,950 --> 01:29:48,530
Let's go.

2287
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:50,350
Let's go, Tyrone.

2288
01:29:51,670 --> 01:29:52,450
We got...

2289
01:29:52,450 --> 01:29:52,970
There's the...

2290
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:54,030
Where do I go?

2291
01:29:54,330 --> 01:29:55,090
What the fuck?

2292
01:29:57,090 --> 01:29:57,870
Where the fuck?

2293
01:29:57,890 --> 01:29:58,570
Oh, there's a bat.

2294
01:29:58,850 --> 01:30:00,270
Wait, we should fight a werewolf.

2295
01:30:01,130 --> 01:30:03,530
Oh my god, it's the fucking moose.

2296
01:30:05,570 --> 01:30:06,790
Don't worry, I got the bat.

2297
01:30:07,910 --> 01:30:08,530
Don't worry.

2298
01:30:09,350 --> 01:30:10,470
Don't worry, Tyrone.

2299
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:11,370
I got this too.

2300
01:30:11,790 --> 01:30:12,650
Why the fuck?

2301
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:15,180
The moose.

2302
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:16,600
Hey, but there's his.

2303
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:17,300
You guys.

2304
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:17,600
You guys.

2305
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:17,980
We got this.

2306
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:21,400
Okay, nice.

2307
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:23,540
All right, I got the gold.

2308
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:25,560
Don't worry, Tyrone, I got you!

2309
01:30:28,860 --> 01:30:30,980
Don't worry, I saved your life, Tyrone.

2310
01:30:34,380 --> 01:30:36,160
We're in moose land now.

2311
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:37,400
We're in...

2312
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:38,660
Wait, there's another moose.

2313
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:41,200
Did you see that?

2314
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:43,300
We're in fucking Canada.

2315
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:47,160
Oh my god, I told you Canada's dangerous.

2316
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:50,220
I knew it.

2317
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:52,360
We're in fucking Canada now.

2318
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:54,280
Okay, what's this?

2319
01:30:54,620 --> 01:30:55,420
Ooh, lion statue.

2320
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:56,540
Don't worry, I got you!

2321
01:30:58,420 --> 01:30:59,560
Got you, Tyrone!

2322
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:01,740
Don't worry!

2323
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:03,000
Oh shit!

2324
01:31:03,180 --> 01:31:03,380
Oh!

2325
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:05,000
Oh, I'm worrying!

2326
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:06,560
I'm worrying!

2327
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:07,340
I aggroed him!

2328
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:08,580
Don't worry.

2329
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:09,380
Alright, my turn.

2330
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:11,180
Look at that.

2331
01:31:12,420 --> 01:31:15,600
Be sure you stay away from this area.

2332
01:31:17,980 --> 01:31:19,340
Oh my god.

2333
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:22,340
I can't believe it.

2334
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:24,000
The dangerous lands of Canada.

2335
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:26,920
Hope the RCMP doesn't show up.

2336
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:29,500
Alright, nice.

2337
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:31,760
Looks like a cemetery here too.

2338
01:31:32,340 --> 01:31:32,940
Whoa!

2339
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:37,340
Whoa, whoa, whoa, WHOA!

2340
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,780
There is tree, guys?

2341
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:41,160
There is tree, guys?

2342
01:31:41,180 --> 01:31:46,660
Okay, not gonna lie, Dungeon Point has so many more enemies to deal with.

2343
01:31:46,980 --> 01:31:53,360
Like, getting darker and darker are just like goblins and skele- goblins, skeletons, and like, zombies.

2344
01:31:55,280 --> 01:32:00,040
There's like, fucking tree guys, rats, bats, Canada.

2345
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:06,600
Fucking werewolves.

2346
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:09,080
There's so many enemies here.

2347
01:32:11,180 --> 01:32:11,340
Ooh!

2348
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,340
Ooh, loot!

2349
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:17,260
I wanna fight that other team.

2350
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:19,320
Wait, is that boss?

2351
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,680
Tyrone, is that boss over there?

2352
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:27,100
Is that one of those- Oh no, there's zombies too!

2353
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:27,880
Whoa!

2354
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:30,940
Okay, don't worry, I got you.

2355
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:33,480
Don't worry, Tyrone, I'm here to help.

2356
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:34,560
Wait, I got hit!

2357
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:36,120
What hit me?

2358
01:32:38,980 --> 01:32:39,560
Don't worry.

2359
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:41,500
Don't worry, I'm here to save you.

2360
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:42,920
Ooh, more shield!

2361
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:45,180
Wait, can I put this on?

2362
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:46,080
Ooh!

2363
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:47,520
Better gloves!

2364
01:32:48,620 --> 01:32:50,060
My big brother!

2365
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:54,760
That's like stuff I can make money out of.

2366
01:32:56,540 --> 01:32:57,100
Alright.

2367
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:00,180
Don't worry.

2368
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:02,220
I got these zombies.

2369
01:33:03,820 --> 01:33:04,380
Pew!

2370
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,200
Pew!

2371
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:06,280
Alright.

2372
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:08,380
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

2373
01:33:09,180 --> 01:33:10,260
Oh, it's the RCMP!

2374
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,180
The RCMP is here, Tyrone!

2375
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:15,860
Tyrone, the RCMP knows I've been grave robbing!

2376
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:21,420
Okay, he's running...

2377
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:22,920
Wait, where is he?

2378
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:23,700
Oh, he's walking away.

2379
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:24,380
He's walking away.

2380
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:28,040
Okay, I can grab the...

2381
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:29,680
I can get the zombies though.

2382
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:31,600
That's right.

2383
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:32,960
106.

2384
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:34,760
Oh!

2385
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:39,920
I fucked up.

2386
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:40,920
I fucked up.

2387
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:41,480
Wait.

2388
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:42,680
I fucked up.

2389
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:43,800
Tyrone!

2390
01:33:44,260 --> 01:33:46,400
Tyrone, he's slowly following me!

2391
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:48,400
Oh, okay.

2392
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:49,020
Nice.

2393
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:50,320
Don't worry.

2394
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:51,620
Got you!

2395
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:52,660
Whoa!

2396
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:54,860
Oh!

2397
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:57,420
Axeman, not hap- Whoa!

2398
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:01,120
Okay.

2399
01:34:01,580 --> 01:34:03,220
Okay, I think I...

2400
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:06,680
Okay, I think I should not have aggro.

2401
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:07,360
I aggroed Axeman!

2402
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:08,800
Don't worry.

2403
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:11,340
Soul time!

2404
01:34:12,340 --> 01:34:13,380
Soul time!

2405
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:15,220
Wait, he's so tanky.

2406
01:34:15,540 --> 01:34:17,940
Holy shit, he's so tanky.

2407
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:19,080
Woohoo!

2408
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:20,080
Woo!

2409
01:34:21,660 --> 01:34:22,440
Got you.

2410
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:23,860
Alright.

2411
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:26,580
What is he doing?

2412
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:27,820
He's just bashing his head.

2413
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:28,100
Is he?

2414
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:33,240
He's just bashing his head.

2415
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:34,440
Okay.

2416
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:38,400
How much HP does he have?

2417
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:38,780
Oh!

2418
01:34:38,780 --> 01:34:39,280
He's dead.

2419
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:40,400
Nice.

2420
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:42,140
That was so easy.

2421
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:43,240
Oh, that's for you!

2422
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:45,340
Me?

2423
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:47,320
Okay.

2424
01:34:48,580 --> 01:34:49,800
That was so easy.

2425
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:50,580
Alright.

2426
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:50,980
Nice.

2427
01:34:51,540 --> 01:34:52,100
Alright.

2428
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:52,900
Let's find...

2429
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:54,000
Let's find those two.

2430
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:56,660
We gotta show them who is the better duo.

2431
01:34:58,660 --> 01:34:59,220
Boink.

2432
01:34:59,240 --> 01:34:59,620
Yeah.

2433
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:01,660
He fucking boinks his head.

2434
01:35:04,060 --> 01:35:04,980
What the fuck?

2435
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:06,240
Okay.

2436
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:06,660
Okay.

2437
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:07,500
I haven't...

2438
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:09,180
I haven't killed...

2439
01:35:09,180 --> 01:35:11,260
I haven't, like, accidentally hit Tyrone yet.

2440
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:12,640
Okay.

2441
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:13,960
Nice.

2442
01:35:14,580 --> 01:35:15,160
Alright.

2443
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,080
Tyrone, we gotta find him.

2444
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:20,340
We gotta find that duo.

2445
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:22,460
We gotta beat their ass.

2446
01:35:23,140 --> 01:35:25,100
Wait, Tyrone knows where the duo is?

2447
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:29,600
Don't worry, I got you.

2448
01:35:31,340 --> 01:35:32,760
Tyrone, why are you getting away?

2449
01:35:34,540 --> 01:35:35,120
Alright.

2450
01:35:35,220 --> 01:35:35,560
Okay.

2451
01:35:36,060 --> 01:35:36,640
Okay.

2452
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:37,120
Let's see.

2453
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:37,960
Oh, wait.

2454
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:38,500
Do I have pants?

2455
01:35:40,140 --> 01:35:40,880
I do.

2456
01:35:41,820 --> 01:35:43,160
Oh, wait.

2457
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:44,020
It does more.

2458
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:46,200
Alright.

2459
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:46,620
Nice.

2460
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:47,740
I got pants.

2461
01:35:48,940 --> 01:35:50,100
Oh, I want arrows.

2462
01:35:50,420 --> 01:35:51,040
Alright, Tyrone.

2463
01:35:54,060 --> 01:35:54,800
Let's see.

2464
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:55,920
Oh, wait.

2465
01:35:55,980 --> 01:35:57,180
I'm, like, a little hurt.

2466
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:57,780
Let me...

2467
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:01,500
Guys, I'm a little hurt, guys.

2468
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:02,220
I mean...

2469
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:04,060
Oh, shit!

2470
01:36:04,140 --> 01:36:04,560
Oh, shit!

2471
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:06,620
Oh, shit!

2472
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:07,920
I'm gonna...

2473
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:08,520
Please check inventory.

2474
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:11,320
Is that better?

2475
01:36:11,860 --> 01:36:13,160
Wait, that's not better.

2476
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:15,700
That's just money.

2477
01:36:17,820 --> 01:36:18,460
Okay.

2478
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:22,440
Is there fall damage in this game?

2479
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:26,400
This is such a big map.

2480
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:29,400
We literally have not found the duo at all.

2481
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:33,640
And this map is actually huge.

2482
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:34,580
Holy shit.

2483
01:36:34,820 --> 01:36:35,380
No?

2484
01:36:35,380 --> 01:36:35,620
No!

2485
01:36:35,660 --> 01:36:40,380
I mean, I could have been doing this this entire- Oh my god, I could have just jumped off.

2486
01:36:40,620 --> 01:36:42,140
I can't believe it.

2487
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:45,640
I didn't know!

2488
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:47,260
I thought there was fall damage!

2489
01:36:47,860 --> 01:36:50,560
Cause there's fall damage in Dark and Darker!

2490
01:36:53,420 --> 01:36:55,680
Tyrone, we have to find the duo, Tyrone!

2491
01:36:55,900 --> 01:36:57,380
I don't care about loot!

2492
01:36:57,660 --> 01:36:59,140
I just wanna kill!

2493
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:02,700
Tyrone, come over!

2494
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:04,180
They must be in the castle!

2495
01:37:04,180 --> 01:37:06,020
Where else could they be?

2496
01:37:09,060 --> 01:37:12,040
I can't believe gravity is not real, chat.

2497
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:13,980
They must be in the castle!

2498
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:18,280
We have to kill them!

2499
01:37:18,340 --> 01:37:19,860
We have to show them who's boss!

2500
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:21,580
And it's us!

2501
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:23,700
What the fuck?

2502
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:24,280
You're so fast!

2503
01:37:24,740 --> 01:37:25,840
This should be illegal!

2504
01:37:27,220 --> 01:37:28,920
How are you so fucking fast?

2505
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:31,820
Oh shit, there's so many rats.

2506
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:32,920
Oh!

2507
01:37:33,220 --> 01:37:34,160
Tyrone, what is this?

2508
01:37:34,180 --> 01:37:35,540
What if they come for me, Tyrone?

2509
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:38,760
Wait, Tyrone, I'm not as fast as you!

2510
01:37:39,260 --> 01:37:40,920
You're literally a cat!

2511
01:37:44,740 --> 01:37:46,240
Oh shit, what have they said?

2512
01:37:46,540 --> 01:37:47,700
We have to find them!

2513
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:49,500
That means they're here somewhere.

2514
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:52,300
Wait, no, that's the boss area, Tyrone.

2515
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:53,560
Why are you taking me to the boss?

2516
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:57,740
Where the fu- That's- This is Goblin Sharpshooter!

2517
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:04,160
Tyrone, why are you taking us to the boss?

2518
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:05,020
Tyrone!

2519
01:38:07,900 --> 01:38:09,420
Tyrone, what are you doing?

2520
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:10,640
Wait.

2521
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:12,760
The boss is dead.

2522
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,400
Wait a minute, they killed the boss?

2523
01:38:18,220 --> 01:38:18,740
OH!

2524
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:19,880
THEY DIDN'T KILL THE BOSS!

2525
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:20,740
THEY DIDN'T SPOT IT!

2526
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:23,800
What are you doing?

2527
01:38:26,940 --> 01:38:28,360
Oh my god!

2528
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:30,360
Look at that movement!

2529
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:36,120
Look at that fucking movement though!

2530
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:37,760
Oh, they must be here!

2531
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:38,560
The door is open!

2532
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:43,080
The door stopped being open!

2533
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:48,500
They must be here!

2534
01:38:50,540 --> 01:38:52,740
Wait, these are- All these doors are locked!

2535
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:56,220
Don't worry, I got you!

2536
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:00,820
I know you're still alive somewhere.

2537
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:03,820
I know you're still alive somewhere.

2538
01:39:04,780 --> 01:39:06,360
Okay, we found a por- OH!

2539
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:08,040
OH!

2540
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:09,960
OH!

2541
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:12,800
Okay, we found one of the porters.

2542
01:39:14,980 --> 01:39:15,780
Don't worry!

2543
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:17,280
Don't worry!

2544
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:18,480
I'm moving!

2545
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:20,820
That's it, fuck this.

2546
01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:21,740
OH NO!

2547
01:39:23,140 --> 01:39:24,200
You can't get me!

2548
01:39:24,340 --> 01:39:24,880
Soul time!

2549
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:29,380
That's right.

2550
01:39:30,540 --> 01:39:32,000
That's right, you can't kill me.

2551
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,300
I have the power of soul.

2552
01:39:35,340 --> 01:39:35,820
Alright.

2553
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:39,920
Where could- Wait, this door is open!

2554
01:39:40,580 --> 01:39:41,820
No, that's just a gate.

2555
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,140
Wait, no, that's just a gate.

2556
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:44,080
That's just another portal.

2557
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:44,980
It's JK.

2558
01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:47,380
Where could they be?

2559
01:39:48,580 --> 01:39:50,260
They must be alive somewhere.

2560
01:39:51,740 --> 01:39:52,720
Where are you?

2561
01:39:52,740 --> 01:39:54,100
I know you're still here!

2562
01:39:57,560 --> 01:39:59,680
This map is huge, Tyrone!

2563
01:39:59,820 --> 01:40:00,900
Where could they be?

2564
01:40:02,060 --> 01:40:04,640
We just need to kill one guy!

2565
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:06,420
We just need to kill one guy!

2566
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:09,640
I'm here to bounty hunt!

2567
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:15,420
I literally need to bounty hunt one guy!

2568
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:20,440
I literally need to bounty hunt one guy!

2569
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:21,240
Oh shit.

2570
01:40:21,620 --> 01:40:22,300
That's a rat.

2571
01:40:23,740 --> 01:40:24,600
Oh, I got you.

2572
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:27,240
We found so many porters!

2573
01:40:29,300 --> 01:40:32,700
He has a bounty on his head and we're here to claim it!

2574
01:40:32,820 --> 01:40:32,920
He has a bounty on his head and we're here to claim it!

2575
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:32,960
He has a bounty on his head and we're here to claim it!

2576
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:35,520
We need a blood sacrifice!

2577
01:40:36,540 --> 01:40:38,660
We need a blood sacrifice!

2578
01:40:40,180 --> 01:40:40,960
You know what?

2579
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:41,440
Fuck this.

2580
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:42,480
I can use the big sword.

2581
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:43,540
I ain't scared.

2582
01:40:47,300 --> 01:40:49,360
All these doors are closed too!

2583
01:40:50,020 --> 01:40:51,180
That's the hard part!

2584
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:53,780
All the doors are closed!

2585
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:55,600
So I can't find that- Whoa!

2586
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:58,500
I can't find that one guy!

2587
01:40:59,040 --> 01:40:59,940
I can't find that one guy!

2588
01:40:59,980 --> 01:41:02,560
And he hasn't escaped yet too!

2589
01:41:02,940 --> 01:41:03,080
And he hasn't escaped yet too!

2590
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:04,760
So I know he's alive!

2591
01:41:07,340 --> 01:41:09,500
I know you're alive!

2592
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:12,320
You must be hiding somewhere!

2593
01:41:13,020 --> 01:41:15,180
You must be hiding somewhere!

2594
01:41:15,180 --> 01:41:16,920
You have to be hiding somewhere!

2595
01:41:17,260 --> 01:41:17,300
You have to be hiding somewhere!

2596
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:18,460
I can feel you!

2597
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:21,520
Don't worry.

2598
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:23,480
What the fuck?

2599
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:24,460
Why don't they attack back?

2600
01:41:26,660 --> 01:41:27,880
Is that like a...

2601
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:29,020
A druid thing?

2602
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:31,400
Where they can bait people?

2603
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:33,360
Oh no!

2604
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:34,420
The blood moon is rising!

2605
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:38,060
The blood moon is rising!

2606
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:39,680
And we have yet to find them!

2607
01:41:40,540 --> 01:41:41,600
That one guy!

2608
01:41:43,540 --> 01:41:45,840
You have to escape sooner or later!

2609
01:41:46,420 --> 01:41:47,280
You have to escape sooner or later!

2610
01:41:50,630 --> 01:41:51,150
Oh!

2611
01:41:51,350 --> 01:41:51,710
Wait!

2612
01:41:51,830 --> 01:41:52,550
He might be here!

2613
01:41:52,550 --> 01:41:53,730
He might be here!

2614
01:41:53,830 --> 01:41:56,310
They're all running away from- They're all running away to somewhere!

2615
01:42:02,790 --> 01:42:03,970
I think he's here!

2616
01:42:08,550 --> 01:42:09,970
You're all walking somewhere!

2617
01:42:10,090 --> 01:42:10,950
He has to be here!

2618
01:42:12,590 --> 01:42:13,270
Oh no!

2619
01:42:13,310 --> 01:42:14,530
The blood moon is still rising!

2620
01:42:14,890 --> 01:42:16,110
You must be here!

2621
01:42:16,170 --> 01:42:16,950
Where are you?

2622
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:23,700
I know there's still one guy alive!

2623
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:24,800
I know there's still one guy alive!

2624
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:29,420
I know there's still one guy alive!

2625
01:42:29,420 --> 01:42:31,380
The hunt for the last guy!

2626
01:42:31,460 --> 01:42:31,600
The hunt for the last guy!

2627
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:34,520
Oh no!

2628
01:42:34,580 --> 01:42:35,640
There's one minute left!

2629
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:36,920
It's okay, Tyrone!

2630
01:42:36,980 --> 01:42:38,420
We know where the portals are, right?

2631
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:41,440
There's no way!

2632
01:42:41,580 --> 01:42:42,620
This door is open!

2633
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:47,920
He might- Wait!

2634
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:49,540
Is it because I was here?

2635
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:51,120
Wait, was I here?

2636
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:52,620
Am I going in circles, Tyrone?

2637
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,280
Am I- No!

2638
01:42:56,840 --> 01:42:57,720
He escaped!

2639
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:01,380
And he had to- He just escaped!

2640
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:05,020
He- He actually escaped!

2641
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:07,360
That- Fucker!

2642
01:43:08,780 --> 01:43:10,160
It's a bomb!

2643
01:43:10,660 --> 01:43:16,960
We hunted him for 20- We hunted him for 20 years!

2644
01:43:17,460 --> 01:43:19,200
And the man escaped!

2645
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:21,620
It's a bomb!

2646
01:43:21,860 --> 01:43:24,500
And I didn't get the bounty!

2647
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:32,280
I just wanted the fuck- I didn't care about the loot!

2648
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:34,360
I just wanted- I just wanted to kill him!

2649
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:40,340
Oh my god!

2650
01:43:40,540 --> 01:43:42,440
That fucker!

2651
01:43:42,620 --> 01:43:43,220
Tyrone!

2652
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:44,360
You can't die!

2653
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:45,000
Tyrone!

2654
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:50,500
The doker has escaped!

2655
01:43:50,660 --> 01:43:51,680
Don't worry, Tyrone!

2656
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:52,560
I believe in you!

2657
01:43:52,620 --> 01:43:54,380
You can kill them in 40 seconds!

2658
01:43:56,500 --> 01:43:59,580
What are you playing?

2659
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:02,120
I couldn't even find my food!

2660
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:10,740
I- I couldn't even- We went through 20 rooms!

2661
01:44:11,160 --> 01:44:14,720
I couldn't even find my food if I wanted to!

2662
01:44:15,100 --> 01:44:16,260
He disappeared!

2663
01:44:19,490 --> 01:44:21,540
I can't believe it!

2664
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:24,100
I can't believe it!

2665
01:44:24,180 --> 01:44:26,840
We literally needed to find this one guy!

2666
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:29,060
And he left!

2667
01:44:29,220 --> 01:44:29,900
He escaped!

2668
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:35,060
That's why I'm level 4 now, bitch!

2669
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:38,280
Oh my god!

2670
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:40,620
I'm so mad!

2671
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:46,160
I'm so mad!

2672
01:44:46,300 --> 01:44:46,560
I'm so mad!

2673
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:46,600
I'm so mad!

2674
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:47,900
I can't believe it!

2675
01:44:48,020 --> 01:44:49,740
I can't believe he got away!

2676
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:51,800
I don't need this!

2677
01:44:52,120 --> 01:44:53,380
I don't need that!

2678
01:44:54,900 --> 01:44:56,940
Get the shit away from me!

2679
01:44:56,940 --> 01:44:58,300
I don't need any of this!

2680
01:44:58,500 --> 01:45:00,380
Oh, I can use arrows?

2681
01:45:00,780 --> 01:45:01,460
Oh, okay.

2682
01:45:01,580 --> 01:45:02,740
I don't need shiz.

2683
01:45:02,940 --> 01:45:04,620
What if I just bring arrows?

2684
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:05,760
Alright.

2685
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:08,760
999 bolts?

2686
01:45:09,260 --> 01:45:11,040
For 25 gold?

2687
01:45:11,140 --> 01:45:12,660
Give this shit to me!

2688
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:15,360
Oh!

2689
01:45:15,540 --> 01:45:16,180
Oh, never mind.

2690
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:22,120
One piece doesn't- I thought- Okay, I thought it was like 25 gold for 999.

2691
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:27,340
I- I guess it was one- One bolt is- 25.

2692
01:45:27,620 --> 01:45:28,180
Alright.

2693
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:29,840
One bolt is 25.

2694
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:32,440
Okay, that's less impressive now.

2695
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:33,600
Alright.

2696
01:45:34,180 --> 01:45:42,220
Wait, can I do the thing in- Can I do the thing in like- Uh...

Uh, you need the auction house listing- I have to go to the store?!

2701
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:56,420
Okay.

2702
01:45:56,940 --> 01:45:57,380
Good.

2703
01:45:58,650 --> 01:45:59,580
Sell, purchase.

2704
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,920
Oh, so like these are like things you can buy.

2705
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:03,620
Okay.

Okay.

2708
01:46:08,620 --> 01:46:10,240
I can buy gear rolls?

2709
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:11,960
What the fuck is gear rolls?

2710
01:46:12,740 --> 01:46:14,020
The fuck is that?

2711
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:17,980
Is it in the merchant?

Mithril dice.

Not be lost the next time you enter.

2716
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:29,600
Is it?

2717
01:46:29,780 --> 01:46:30,300
Is it this?

2718
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:32,400
Oh, it's in the tray?

01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:36,720
And it rolls- you buy the gear and it rolls right- Oh!

Alright, is it these?

Oh!

Wait, that's interesting.

2727
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:50,480
Alright.

Alright.

Uh...

2734
01:47:10,260 --> 01:47:12,020
Do I need to pay more?

2735
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:20,800
Or can I just pay- If I purchase a map, does it increase the- Does it increase the stats?

2736
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:23,780
Or does it just give me a second armor piece?

2737
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:27,540
Does it just give me a second armor piece, chat?

2738
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:30,400
Oh, okay.

2739
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:30,980
I'll just buy one.

2740
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:32,160
Alright.

2741
01:47:32,260 --> 01:47:33,140
What did I get?

2742
01:47:37,050 --> 01:47:37,950
What did I get?

01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:54,480
Oh, shit!

Sounds nice!

2751
01:47:58,520 --> 01:48:00,400
Sounds pretty- That looks pretty good.

2752
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:02,760
Alright, let's get pants!

2753
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:04,040
You know what?

01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:04,860
I have the money!

2755
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:06,120
Let's fucking do it!

Alright.

2759

Nice.

I'll get it.

2761
01:48:19,480 --> 01:48:20,280

Alright.

2765
01:48:23,980 --> 01:48:25,740
Now we'll grab some arrows, too.

2766
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:29,360
And then we'll put this away.

2767
01:48:31,100 --> 01:48:32,560
And this away.

2768
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:34,600
We don't need any of that shit.

2769
01:48:34,860 --> 01:48:36,580
Okay, let's grab some potions, though.

2770
01:48:36,900 --> 01:48:37,380
Alright.

2771
01:48:38,660 --> 01:48:40,040
And we'll put that away.

2772
01:48:40,140 --> 01:48:41,340
And then this away.

2773
01:48:42,260 --> 01:48:43,920
And then- I'll sell these later.

2774
01:48:44,460 --> 01:48:45,540
It's time to game.

2775
01:48:45,780 --> 01:48:46,000
Alright.

2776
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:49,440
Alright.

2777
01:48:49,740 --> 01:48:51,680
Does anyone else want to be our bounty hunter?

2778
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:58,540
Our mission is to kill the other people!

2779
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:00,920
Man!

2780
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:02,200

2785
01:49:08,780 --> 01:49:09,460
Alright.

01:49:09,860 --> 01:49:10,600
Let's go!

2787
01:49:11,060 --> 01:49:12,400
We're the bounty hunters!

2788
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:16,660
We're gonna hunt some- We're not gonna kill regular people!

2789
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:18,400
Regular moms!

2790
01:49:18,580 --> 01:49:20,540
We're here to hunt some bounties!

2791
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:22,620
Let's fucking go!

2792
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:27,020
Let's go!

2793
01:49:27,300 --> 01:49:29,440
We're gonna- Everybody, ready up!

2794
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:32,820
The Doker is here to hunt some bounties!

2795
01:49:40,490 --> 01:49:43,450
Got Tyrone- Tyrone healing!

2796
01:49:44,230 --> 01:49:44,650
Damn!

2797
01:49:45,330 --> 01:49:51,990
Alright, we got Box as the DPS, Tyrone as the healer, and I'm the captain!

2798
01:49:55,270 --> 01:49:57,570
The Doker and my goons!

2799
01:50:04,700 --> 01:50:05,780
Don't worry, team.

2800
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:10,020
We're here to kill- to kill the lobby!

2801
01:50:12,660 --> 01:50:13,220
Oh!

2802
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:14,320
Wait, three!

2803
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:15,140
Wait, that's us!

2804
01:50:15,560 --> 01:50:17,000
Wait, that's just us three!

2805
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:19,600
Wait, how are we gonna kill the lobby if it's just us three?

2806
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:20,720
Alright!

2807
01:50:22,140 --> 01:50:26,440
If it's just us three, Tyrone versus Box!

2808
01:50:28,220 --> 01:50:33,860
We're gonna- We're gonna watch Tyrone and Box duke it out if it's just us three.

2809
01:50:37,160 --> 01:50:38,260
We'll have a bet!

2810
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:43,680
We're gonna- we're gonna fight- You know that area with the rat and two knights?

2811
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:45,280
We're gonna head there, okay?

2812
01:50:45,320 --> 01:50:50,480
If it's just us three, we're gonna head over there, and then, yes, the healer versus Box.

2813
01:50:52,700 --> 01:50:54,240
I believe in Tyrone!

2814
01:50:54,920 --> 01:50:56,940
I believe in him, he can heal himself!

2815
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:58,740
Wait, no, there's three other people!

2816
01:50:59,320 --> 01:50:59,820
Guys!

2817
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:00,440
JK!

2818
01:51:01,940 --> 01:51:03,520
JK, look, there they are!

2819
01:51:03,740 --> 01:51:05,980
Oh my god, these guys are fucked!

2820
01:51:06,140 --> 01:51:07,780
I see a wooden shield!

2821
01:51:08,220 --> 01:51:10,620
Oh my god, it's a wizard!

2822
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:14,160
Okay, what kind of hat is he wearing?

2823
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:15,100
I'm a little concerned.

2824
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:19,540
From the distance I see it, there's something off about this wizard and his hat.

2825
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:23,020
I'm like- I need to get closer!

2826
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:27,100
I don't know how I feel about this hat.

2827
01:51:28,740 --> 01:51:29,320
Oh my god, no!

2828
01:51:29,540 --> 01:51:30,440
Oh god.

2829
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:33,080
Oh!

2830
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:36,480
I should not have went closer!

2831
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,320
That is a lot worse!

2832
01:51:40,140 --> 01:51:40,340
Oh!

2833
01:51:42,440 --> 01:51:43,000
Oh no!

2834
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:45,780
Alright, where's your third?

2835
01:51:46,520 --> 01:51:47,820
Where's your third?

2836
01:51:48,820 --> 01:51:50,600
Wait, does he have good loot?

2837
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:54,240
Let me check his- No, his inventory is invisible!

2838
01:51:54,660 --> 01:51:55,600
You fucking coward!

2839
01:51:56,020 --> 01:51:57,320
You fucking coward!

2840
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:03,160
You fucking coward!

2841
01:52:03,540 --> 01:52:03,800
You fucking coward!

2842
01:52:03,980 --> 01:52:05,360
You fucking coward!

2843
01:52:05,740 --> 01:52:07,400
I can't believe it!

2844
01:52:07,620 --> 01:52:08,180
Alright.

2845
01:52:08,620 --> 01:52:11,120
I believe in this Tyrone and box.

2846
01:52:13,340 --> 01:52:14,320
We got this!

2847
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:20,020
I needed to know his loot to see how fucked we are, but like, I believe.

2848
01:52:20,660 --> 01:52:22,100
I believe in our team.

2849
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:23,700
I have my arrows.

2850
01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:25,880
We have DPS and heals.

2851
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:27,220
What can go wrong?

2852
01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:28,220
We're back in Canada.

2853
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:31,660
Why do we keep spawning in Canada?

2854
01:52:31,960 --> 01:52:32,420
Why?

2855
01:52:33,780 --> 01:52:35,360
I don't understand.

2856
01:52:36,100 --> 01:52:38,920
Why do they keep taking us to Canada?

2857
01:52:40,940 --> 01:52:42,000
Oh shit.

2858
01:52:42,420 --> 01:52:43,860
Oh shit.

2859
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:44,960
Scary trees.

2860
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:47,580
Oh, 166.

2861
01:52:47,660 --> 01:52:49,160
Oh, this is like...

2862
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:50,780
Oh, nice bats.

2863
01:52:51,620 --> 01:52:52,700
It's my hometown.

2864
01:52:53,580 --> 01:52:55,100
Oh my god, look at them go.

2865
01:52:56,280 --> 01:52:57,100
Holy shit.

2866
01:52:57,140 --> 01:52:57,480
Box!

2867
01:52:59,140 --> 01:53:01,600
You should be able to dodge that box.

2868
01:53:01,640 --> 01:53:02,760
You're level 20, man.

2869
01:53:03,420 --> 01:53:03,920
Nice.

2870
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:06,680
Oh, I get back my arrows too.

2871
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:07,520
That's nice.

2872
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:09,940
I get back my arrows after.

2873
01:53:11,100 --> 01:53:11,600
Okay.

2874
01:53:12,860 --> 01:53:14,500
Back on home- Oh shit, werewolf!

2875
01:53:14,580 --> 01:53:15,040
We got this!

2876
01:53:15,880 --> 01:53:16,380
Guys!

2877
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:18,500
It's a werewolf!

2878
01:53:19,940 --> 01:53:21,160
Holy shit, he's spinning!

2879
01:53:23,140 --> 01:53:24,280
Look at him go!

2880
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:26,440
Go, box, go!

2881
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:29,960
Don't worry, I did 133.

2882
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:34,380
The infamous Canadian werewolves.

2883
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:35,600
Oh shit, my arrow.

2884
01:53:38,140 --> 01:53:39,980
You got this, box!

2885
01:53:41,720 --> 01:53:43,020
I hit a headshot!

2886
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:46,640
You got this!

2887
01:53:46,980 --> 01:53:48,660
What loot do we get from a werewolf?

2888
01:53:48,900 --> 01:53:49,660
Wait, that's it?

2889
01:53:51,160 --> 01:53:51,860
Not even a lot.

2890
01:53:53,020 --> 01:53:53,500
Alright.

2891
01:53:55,300 --> 01:53:57,260
Yeah, you guys gotta be careful in Canada.

2892
01:53:58,200 --> 01:53:59,920
There's a lot of werewolves down here.

2893
01:54:01,700 --> 01:54:02,460
Alright, nice.

2894
01:54:02,580 --> 01:54:03,000
Headshot.

2895
01:54:04,340 --> 01:54:08,140
I mean, 166 is not bad for a headshot.

2896
01:54:09,180 --> 01:54:11,240
And I get my arrows back too, apparently.

2897
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:11,700
Right?

2898
01:54:12,240 --> 01:54:13,700
Do I get two arrows back?

2899
01:54:14,360 --> 01:54:14,840
Yeah!

2900
01:54:15,080 --> 01:54:16,960
If I hit it, I get two arrows back.

2901
01:54:19,300 --> 01:54:19,780
Okay.

2902
01:54:19,780 --> 01:54:20,540
Ooh, wait.

2903
01:54:21,160 --> 01:54:21,700
What is...

2904
01:54:22,260 --> 01:54:22,980
Let's do defense.

2905
01:54:23,220 --> 01:54:23,820
I like that.

2906
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:26,260
What are you kidding?

2907
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:26,620
Is that bad?

2908
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:29,480
Nice.

2909
01:54:29,540 --> 01:54:29,880
Okay.

2910
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:32,040
What?

2911
01:54:32,160 --> 01:54:32,840
What did you drop?

2912
01:54:33,660 --> 01:54:34,100
Ooh!

2913
01:54:34,180 --> 01:54:34,860
A helmet!

2914
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:37,920
Oh my god!

2915
01:54:38,580 --> 01:54:39,020
Nice.

2916
01:54:39,180 --> 01:54:40,680
Alright guys, we gotta find those three.

2917
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:42,640
Alright guys, come on.

2918
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:44,180
We're gonna head up.

2919
01:54:45,100 --> 01:54:45,780
It's time.

2920
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:49,840
It's time to head up into the castle we go.

2921
01:54:51,160 --> 01:54:52,580
We have to hunt some bounties, boys.

2922
01:54:54,440 --> 01:54:56,080
As I figure out how to get up.

2923
01:54:56,160 --> 01:54:56,340
Alright.

2924
01:54:56,980 --> 01:54:59,040
It's time to hunt some bounties.

2925
01:55:03,220 --> 01:55:04,360
We got this.

2926
01:55:05,680 --> 01:55:06,900
We're here to kill.

2927
01:55:07,380 --> 01:55:09,520
We're here to claim our bounties today.

2928
01:55:11,340 --> 01:55:11,860
Damn.

2929
01:55:13,020 --> 01:55:13,540
Alright.

2930
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:15,180
I'll grab these chests.

2931
01:55:17,780 --> 01:55:18,300
Ooh!

2932
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:20,460
That's some good-ass gold.

2933
01:55:21,480 --> 01:55:21,960
Okay.

2934
01:55:23,460 --> 01:55:24,340
Maybe you're right.

2935
01:55:24,440 --> 01:55:24,820
Maybe...

2936
01:55:24,820 --> 01:55:26,160
Maybe sword is better.

2937
01:55:26,700 --> 01:55:27,860
Where could they be?

2938
01:55:28,140 --> 01:55:29,760
They have to be in the castle.

2939
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:32,380
Like, where else could they go?

2940
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:35,700
Alright, if we killed them, I want to see you two fight.

2941
01:55:41,020 --> 01:55:42,460
This goddamn mosquito!

2942
01:55:42,940 --> 01:55:43,600
Get down!

2943
01:55:45,720 --> 01:55:46,200
Alright.

2944
01:55:47,460 --> 01:55:48,880
Where should we go?

2945
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:50,060
Alright, Tyrone!

2946
01:55:50,340 --> 01:55:50,820
Oh, shit.

2947
01:55:50,840 --> 01:55:51,000
Wait.

2948
01:55:51,740 --> 01:55:52,220
Tyrone!

2949
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:53,520
What do you smell?

2950
01:55:53,800 --> 01:55:55,880
You might not be a druid right now.

2951
01:55:56,420 --> 01:55:57,380
But I know.

2952
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:00,340
I know you still have that dog in you.

2953
01:56:04,820 --> 01:56:05,300
Alright.

2954
01:56:05,940 --> 01:56:06,740
Let's see.

2955
01:56:09,180 --> 01:56:11,400
You can never take the dog out of you.

2956
01:56:12,460 --> 01:56:13,400
Where could they be?

2957
01:56:13,480 --> 01:56:15,220
They must be, like, on the other side.

2958
01:56:15,340 --> 01:56:16,340
They must be in the castle.

2959
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:18,340
They usually spawn...

2960
01:56:18,340 --> 01:56:21,060
If we spawn in that side, they have to spawn in the castle.

2961
01:56:23,580 --> 01:56:24,400
Anything good?

2962
01:56:24,900 --> 01:56:25,580
Oh, there is.

2963
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:28,060
Thanks for opening that for me.

2964
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:29,320
Oh, shit!

2965
01:56:32,020 --> 01:56:32,560
Don't worry.

2966
01:56:32,680 --> 01:56:33,200
I got him.

2967
01:56:34,460 --> 01:56:34,900
Alright.

2968
01:56:36,300 --> 01:56:37,480
Tyrone, I need some heals.

2969
01:56:38,200 --> 01:56:39,200
Thank you, Tyrone.

2970
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:40,700
Tyrone healing.

2971
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:44,440
Alright, we should clean this up.

2972
01:56:44,500 --> 01:56:46,260
Let's clean this up for our fight later.

2973
01:56:46,340 --> 01:56:48,320
Or your fight, and then we'll do a bet.

2974
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:49,660
With the dragon.

2975
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:50,820
Holy shit!

2976
01:56:50,860 --> 01:56:51,640
That was so fast!

2977
01:56:52,400 --> 01:56:54,340
Wait, they're that easy to kill?

2978
01:56:55,060 --> 01:56:55,460
Alright.

2979
01:56:56,640 --> 01:56:57,040
Alright.

2980
01:56:57,180 --> 01:56:58,240
Time to kill these knights.

2981
01:56:58,600 --> 01:56:59,060
Don't worry.

2982
01:56:59,100 --> 01:56:59,700
I got you guys.

2983
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:01,320
Boom!

2984
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:03,160
Wait.

2985
01:57:03,300 --> 01:57:07,680
Oh, I'm doing the same damage as, like, a bow, but with faster DPS.

2986
01:57:09,180 --> 01:57:10,360
Okay, you guys are right.

2987
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:11,020
The bow sucks.

2988
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:13,840
The bow actually sucks.

2989
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:14,840
Can I open it faster?

2990
01:57:16,860 --> 01:57:17,320
Alright.

2991
01:57:20,460 --> 01:57:22,440
I don't remember if they were originally open.

2992
01:57:22,580 --> 01:57:22,800
Oh, wait.

2993
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:23,840
These doors are open.

2994
01:57:23,960 --> 01:57:25,720
Okay, they were supposed to be open.

2995
01:57:26,220 --> 01:57:26,680
Right?

2996
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:28,460
No, they destroyed the doors.

2997
01:57:29,120 --> 01:57:29,580
Right?

2998
01:57:32,060 --> 01:57:33,040
Where would they be?

2999
01:57:34,540 --> 01:57:36,300
Guys, we are not going out.

3000
01:57:36,340 --> 01:57:36,740
Okay.

3001
01:57:37,060 --> 01:57:37,960
Alright, Tyrone.

3002
01:57:39,340 --> 01:57:40,740
Do you smell them, Tyrone?

3003
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:44,540
We failed our last bounty hunt.

3004
01:57:45,460 --> 01:57:47,040
We gotta get them this time.

3005
01:57:48,060 --> 01:57:48,700
Oh, hey.

3006
01:57:48,740 --> 01:57:48,880
Go.

3007
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:50,500
Nice.

3008
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:53,940
What do you smell?

3009
01:57:54,680 --> 01:57:56,340
What do you smell with your...

3010
01:57:56,340 --> 01:57:57,500
with your nose?

3011
01:57:59,200 --> 01:58:00,540
Where do you think they're at?

3012
01:58:02,980 --> 01:58:04,640
Tyrone smells them.

3013
01:58:05,480 --> 01:58:06,340
Tyrone knows.

3014
01:58:08,600 --> 01:58:09,440
He knows.

3015
01:58:10,360 --> 01:58:11,580
He can feel them.

3016
01:58:11,740 --> 01:58:12,760
Let's kill the baby.

3017
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:17,320
Let's tag team on this child.

3018
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:17,940
Let's tag team on this child.

3019
01:58:17,940 --> 01:58:18,760
That's fucking right.

3020
01:58:19,660 --> 01:58:21,540
That's what we're gonna do to them.

3021
01:58:25,060 --> 01:58:26,520
Sniff them out, Tyrone!

3022
01:58:29,900 --> 01:58:30,820
Sniff them out!

3023
01:58:33,620 --> 01:58:34,100
Yeah?

3024
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:34,960
What do you smell?

3025
01:58:35,160 --> 01:58:35,940
What do you smell, boy?

3026
01:58:39,140 --> 01:58:40,840
What do your kitty ears...

3027
01:58:40,840 --> 01:58:42,920
What do your kitty ears and nose see?

3028
01:58:43,160 --> 01:58:43,640
What do your kitty ears and nose see?

3029
01:58:44,540 --> 01:58:46,060
Let's kill this guy first.

3030
01:58:47,080 --> 01:58:47,800
Pew!

3031
01:58:48,340 --> 01:58:49,060
Pew!

3032
01:58:50,360 --> 01:58:51,080
Alright.

3033
01:58:53,260 --> 01:58:55,400
There's so many escape portals.

3034
01:58:55,480 --> 01:58:56,060
There's so many escape portals.

3035
01:58:56,060 --> 01:58:57,360
But yet, no bounties.

3036
01:58:57,720 --> 01:59:00,140
Okay, we found another portal.

3037
01:59:00,280 --> 01:59:01,780
There's so many portals.

3038
01:59:01,780 --> 01:59:02,560
Jesus Christ.

3039
01:59:04,900 --> 01:59:05,620
Alright.

3040
01:59:05,860 --> 01:59:09,420
Where were these portals on my first game?

3041
01:59:11,020 --> 01:59:11,740
Geez.

3042
01:59:11,740 --> 01:59:12,820
Okay.

3043
01:59:13,300 --> 01:59:14,340
Are they outside?

3044
01:59:15,560 --> 01:59:17,040
No, they're not outside.

3045
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:18,960
Wait, unless...

3046
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:19,340
Whoa!

3047
01:59:21,100 --> 01:59:23,440
You thought you could scare me?

3048
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:24,400
I have ears.

3049
01:59:25,100 --> 01:59:26,980
That's fucking right, ghost lady.

3050
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:29,040
I have ears.

3051
01:59:29,340 --> 01:59:30,740
Okay, they're not out here.

3052
01:59:33,540 --> 01:59:34,140
Unless...

3053
01:59:34,140 --> 01:59:35,500
Wait, unless...

3054
01:59:35,500 --> 01:59:37,300
No, they're still not there.

3055
01:59:37,540 --> 01:59:39,240
They haven't escaped yet.

3056
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:41,060
Could they be here?

3057
01:59:42,100 --> 01:59:44,020
This is what your ears are telling you?

3058
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:46,460
None of the doors are open though.

3059
01:59:48,820 --> 01:59:49,340
Oh.

3060
01:59:49,480 --> 01:59:50,000
Rats.

3061
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:51,320
Rats.

3062
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:53,640
There's rats behind me, guys.

3063
01:59:54,360 --> 01:59:55,980
There's rats behind me.

3064
01:59:56,820 --> 01:59:58,420
Okay, there's this door here.

3065
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:00,040
How about this door?

3066
02:00:00,540 --> 02:00:04,160
If I open every door, there has to be an open door somewhere.

3067
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:06,440
Okay, not there.

3068
02:00:15,900 --> 02:00:17,300
Tyrone's just a healer!

3069
02:00:20,820 --> 02:00:22,080
Tyrone!

3070
02:00:22,720 --> 02:00:22,740
Tyrone!

3071
02:00:22,740 --> 02:00:23,940
No!

3072
02:00:29,160 --> 02:00:30,670
We left him!

3073
02:00:34,890 --> 02:00:36,440
Quick, Pox!

3074
02:00:39,100 --> 02:00:39,840
Pox!

3075
02:00:39,880 --> 02:00:41,100
Distract him!

3076
02:00:42,140 --> 02:00:43,400
Distract him!

3077
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:44,460
Oh!

3078
02:00:44,460 --> 02:00:45,080
Oh!

3079
02:00:46,700 --> 02:00:47,960
Oh!

3080
02:00:57,100 --> 02:00:57,480
No!

3081
02:00:57,820 --> 02:01:01,220
We let the healer find them!

3082
02:01:07,660 --> 02:01:10,640
I didn't abandon them.

3083
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:11,180
I...

3084
02:01:13,600 --> 02:01:17,180
Look, it's not I didn't abandon them.

3085
02:01:17,560 --> 02:01:18,840
We just...

3086
02:01:18,840 --> 02:01:21,980
Look, it was 1v2.

3087
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:26,820
They don't understand!

3088
02:01:26,820 --> 02:01:27,120
They're dead!

3089
02:01:27,580 --> 02:01:30,340
I can't believe our healer!

3090
02:01:30,340 --> 02:01:34,340
Our healer found all three of them at once!

3091
02:01:35,720 --> 02:01:37,160
I can't...

3092
02:01:37,160 --> 02:01:41,180
I can't believe our healer was that unlucky!

3093
02:01:41,900 --> 02:01:43,600
Oh shit, he's spinning!

3094
02:01:44,420 --> 02:01:45,760
Oh, he's on fire!

3095
02:01:46,120 --> 02:01:48,160
You got this, Pox!

3096
02:01:48,340 --> 02:01:49,440
This is it!

3097
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:51,220
This is your story!

3098
02:01:51,600 --> 02:01:52,480
Oh...

3099
02:01:52,480 --> 02:01:53,300
Oh...

3100
02:01:55,800 --> 02:01:56,360
Oh...

3101
02:01:56,360 --> 02:01:57,420
And the tea!

3102
02:01:57,780 --> 02:01:59,320
That wasn't me, though.

3103
02:02:06,030 --> 02:02:08,930
Look, this is exactly why I had to leave.

3104
02:02:09,170 --> 02:02:10,810
This is exactly why.

3105
02:02:10,930 --> 02:02:13,950
If I didn't leave, that could've been me!

3106
02:02:15,990 --> 02:02:16,550
Guys...

3107
02:02:16,550 --> 02:02:18,790
Guys, that wasn't my fault, guys.

3108
02:02:18,890 --> 02:02:19,450
Like...

3109
02:02:20,510 --> 02:02:23,570
I had to make a really tough decision there.

3110
02:02:23,950 --> 02:02:28,790
Guys, I had to make a very difficult choice there, guys.

3111
02:02:31,110 --> 02:02:31,730
Like...

3112
02:02:31,730 --> 02:02:34,950
It was such a difficult choice, everybody!

3113
02:02:36,050 --> 02:02:36,670
So...

3114
02:02:36,670 --> 02:02:38,950
Like, it's not my fault!

3115
02:02:39,130 --> 02:02:40,930
It was just very unfortunate!

3116
02:02:41,770 --> 02:02:43,250
That that happened!

3117
02:02:46,250 --> 02:02:46,870
Like...

3118
02:02:47,740 --> 02:02:51,770
Like, I didn't wanna abandon them, but what else could I do?

3119
02:02:51,770 --> 02:02:53,230
In that scenario?

3120
02:02:53,470 --> 02:02:55,990
What else could I have done?

3121
02:02:57,510 --> 02:02:58,810
Guys... What...

3122
02:02:58,810 --> 02:03:01,990
I was like, I'm not being a healer no more.

3123
02:03:03,790 --> 02:03:04,710
Wait!

3124
02:03:05,070 --> 02:03:07,110
Pox lost all his armor!

3125
02:03:08,210 --> 02:03:09,130
Pox...

3126
02:03:09,770 --> 02:03:10,490
No...

3127
02:03:10,490 --> 02:03:12,110
Poor Pox...

3128
02:03:12,110 --> 02:03:15,650
If only somebody could've...

3129
02:03:15,650 --> 02:03:19,150
If only we could've avoided that...

3130
02:03:19,330 --> 02:03:23,770
If... Oh... What else could we have done to avoid it?

3131
02:03:23,830 --> 02:03:27,070
Guys... What could we have done differently?

3132
02:03:28,270 --> 02:03:29,190
Guys...

3133
02:03:31,870 --> 02:03:34,190
Oh... Tyrone's stab!

3134
02:03:34,750 --> 02:03:37,610
Oh no, Tyrone's getting angrier!

3135
02:03:38,190 --> 02:03:39,110
He's...

3136
02:03:39,110 --> 02:03:41,390
He's getting angrier now!

3137
02:03:41,730 --> 02:03:45,030
He's about to stab somebody!

3138
02:03:47,850 --> 02:03:49,510
Oh no...

3139
02:03:49,510 --> 02:03:50,950
My poor...

3140
02:03:52,030 --> 02:03:53,770
My poor lads...

3141
02:03:54,390 --> 02:03:56,270
My poor lads...

3142
02:03:56,270 --> 02:03:56,830
He's so...

3143
02:03:56,830 --> 02:03:58,390
He's so poor now...

3144
02:03:59,690 --> 02:04:00,410
Guys...

3145
02:04:00,410 --> 02:04:02,290
It's okay...

3146
02:04:02,290 --> 02:04:05,510
It's okay... This time...

3147
02:04:05,510 --> 02:04:14,050
This time, we will get our revenge guys... We were just unfortunate, our healing counted all three of them by themselves...

3148
02:04:14,050 --> 02:04:15,630
That was just like...

3149
02:04:15,630 --> 02:04:16,990
What else could we have done?

3150
02:04:17,250 --> 02:04:18,990
Let's go to Sinner's End...

3151
02:04:19,970 --> 02:04:21,490
This seems fun...

3152
02:04:21,910 --> 02:04:22,530
Sinner's End?

3153
02:04:23,070 --> 02:04:23,790
Let's get there!

3154
02:04:26,490 --> 02:04:27,210
Two stars?

3155
02:04:27,570 --> 02:04:29,190
I think we can do that...

3156
02:04:29,680 --> 02:04:31,450
Duck, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you!

3157
02:04:31,530 --> 02:04:35,970
Note to yourself, do not get stuck in a horror film with Ducky...

3158
02:04:37,510 --> 02:04:38,490
Guys, are you ready?

3159
02:04:39,070 --> 02:04:40,490
Tyrone Kitty, we got it!

3160
02:04:40,530 --> 02:04:41,090
We need you!

3161
02:04:43,910 --> 02:04:44,910
What do you mean?

3162
02:04:45,110 --> 02:04:46,130
It was 2v3!

3163
02:04:46,250 --> 02:04:47,510
We lost our healer!

3164
02:04:47,890 --> 02:04:49,230
What could we have done?

3165
02:04:49,810 --> 02:04:51,950
Guys, we have to kill at least one person.

3166
02:04:52,310 --> 02:04:53,470
That's our mission today.

3167
02:04:53,810 --> 02:04:54,930
Guys, team!

3168
02:04:55,210 --> 02:04:56,210
We can do this!

3169
02:04:56,270 --> 02:04:57,630
We can kill one guy!

3170
02:05:02,470 --> 02:05:02,910
Look!

3171
02:05:06,990 --> 02:05:07,430
Look!

3172
02:05:07,850 --> 02:05:12,550
A bounty hunter knows when, when, when like, we need to run!

3173
02:05:13,210 --> 02:05:14,350
This is a new area!

3174
02:05:14,950 --> 02:05:16,210
This area looks cool!

3175
02:05:18,170 --> 02:05:18,450
Alright.

3176
02:05:18,870 --> 02:05:19,710
Are there another...

3177
02:05:19,710 --> 02:05:20,730
Is there another bounty?

3178
02:05:21,310 --> 02:05:22,170
Alright, guys.

3179
02:05:24,050 --> 02:05:28,150
If we can't find anybody, we'll have a 1v1 between you two.

3180
02:05:30,170 --> 02:05:32,030
It'll be the fight of the century.

3181
02:05:33,330 --> 02:05:34,150
What do you mean?

3182
02:05:34,410 --> 02:05:36,050
Somebody has to tell...

3183
02:05:36,050 --> 02:05:37,790
Somebody has to get reinforcements.

3184
02:05:37,930 --> 02:05:39,130
You don't just...

3185
02:05:39,130 --> 02:05:42,950
Guys, you don't just like go in and have everybody die.

3186
02:05:43,130 --> 02:05:43,910
We always need...

3187
02:05:43,910 --> 02:05:46,470
We need a survivor to tell the story.

3188
02:05:46,650 --> 02:05:52,110
I survived so I can retell the great story between Box and Tyrone.

3189
02:05:52,410 --> 02:05:55,870
And their noble sacrifice for the cause.

3190
02:05:58,710 --> 02:06:02,730
They sacrificed themselves for the cause.

3191
02:06:03,090 --> 02:06:04,710
It was so noble of them.

3192
02:06:04,970 --> 02:06:07,010
And I was part of that fight.

3193
02:06:07,330 --> 02:06:09,510
I was their part of the fight.

3194
02:06:09,750 --> 02:06:11,310
And then Box was like, you!

3195
02:06:11,530 --> 02:06:12,150
Go!

3196
02:06:12,430 --> 02:06:13,290
I will...

3197
02:06:13,290 --> 02:06:18,410
I will take on all three of them so you can make your escape.

3198
02:06:18,710 --> 02:06:20,590
And I was like, No, Box!

3199
02:06:20,750 --> 02:06:20,930
No!

3200
02:06:21,030 --> 02:06:21,890
We can't do that!

3201
02:06:21,990 --> 02:06:23,330
It's all of us and nobody!

3202
02:06:23,850 --> 02:06:25,250
And then Box was like, no.

3203
02:06:25,770 --> 02:06:26,790
No, Doki.

3204
02:06:27,450 --> 02:06:28,810
Somebody has to...

3205
02:06:28,810 --> 02:06:30,930
Somebody has to live.

3206
02:06:31,210 --> 02:06:32,190
And I...

3207
02:06:35,290 --> 02:06:36,310
I tried.

3208
02:06:36,530 --> 02:06:39,310
I tried to stop Box and Tyrone.

3209
02:06:39,670 --> 02:06:41,350
I was like, no guys.

3210
02:06:41,550 --> 02:06:43,450
I will not leave you behind.

3211
02:06:43,830 --> 02:06:45,790
But they pushed me out the door.

3212
02:06:46,210 --> 02:06:51,730
They pushed me into the portal and sacrificed themselves for the adventure.

3213
02:06:56,150 --> 02:06:58,550
I tried to stand my ground.

3214
02:06:58,770 --> 02:07:00,270
But they pushed me out.

3215
02:07:00,410 --> 02:07:01,170
Guys!

3216
02:07:01,270 --> 02:07:04,930
They pushed me out of the chamber into the portal.

3217
02:07:06,150 --> 02:07:08,810
Are we role playing or what?

3218
02:07:15,210 --> 02:07:17,790
They literally pushed me into the portal.

3219
02:07:17,950 --> 02:07:20,330
I tried to stand my ground.

3220
02:07:22,230 --> 02:07:22,990
Alright guys.

3221
02:07:23,170 --> 02:07:24,670
Looks like you two are fighting each other.

3222
02:07:24,770 --> 02:07:25,630
Let's find a battleground.

3223
02:07:27,510 --> 02:07:30,610
Let's find an arena for you guys to fight.

3224
02:07:32,090 --> 02:07:33,490
It's just you and I.

3225
02:07:34,970 --> 02:07:35,510
Ow.

3226
02:07:36,830 --> 02:07:37,410
Don't worry.

3227
02:07:37,530 --> 02:07:38,650
I'll bring your loot back.

3228
02:07:38,990 --> 02:07:39,790
Whoever dies.

3229
02:07:40,270 --> 02:07:40,890
Actually, no.

3230
02:07:40,950 --> 02:07:43,870
The winner brings the loot back to the other guy that dies.

3231
02:07:43,970 --> 02:07:45,830
Let's find an arena for you guys to fight in.

3232
02:07:48,250 --> 02:07:48,650
Whoa.

3233
02:07:48,650 --> 02:07:49,430
Wait, what's that?

3234
02:07:51,250 --> 02:07:52,450
Is there stuff in here?

3235
02:07:53,590 --> 02:07:54,870
Oh, I can use the gate.

3236
02:07:55,850 --> 02:07:56,610
Oh, wait.

3237
02:07:56,650 --> 02:07:57,730
He didn't fight back?

3238
02:07:59,630 --> 02:08:00,030
What?

3239
02:08:01,030 --> 02:08:02,210
I didn't know that.

3240
02:08:03,170 --> 02:08:03,650
Alright.

3241
02:08:04,790 --> 02:08:06,670
I didn't know you can fight back.

3242
02:08:08,090 --> 02:08:09,270
Guys, where the f...

3243
02:08:09,270 --> 02:08:10,710
Is this just a dungeon?

3244
02:08:11,090 --> 02:08:13,270
Is there an arena for you guys to fight in?

3245
02:08:14,410 --> 02:08:17,510
I want to find an open arena like that rat area.

3246
02:08:18,750 --> 02:08:19,610
It sucks.

3247
02:08:20,070 --> 02:08:20,650
Oh, wait.

3248
02:08:20,730 --> 02:08:21,250
Maybe here?

3249
02:08:21,990 --> 02:08:23,450
Oh, this could be our arena.

3250
02:08:23,610 --> 02:08:24,850
Is this a good arena?

3251
02:08:25,830 --> 02:08:26,310
Tentacles.

3252
02:08:28,850 --> 02:08:29,630
Oh, no.

3253
02:08:30,750 --> 02:08:32,850
I should drink some more potions.

3254
02:08:33,390 --> 02:08:35,070
Let me grab some more potions.

3255
02:08:35,710 --> 02:08:37,230
I miss Tyrone healing.

3256
02:08:38,090 --> 02:08:38,530
Whoa!

3257
02:08:39,710 --> 02:08:40,150
Whoa!

3258
02:08:41,010 --> 02:08:41,810
What hit me?

3259
02:08:43,670 --> 02:08:44,650
Oh, shit.

3260
02:08:44,710 --> 02:08:45,790
I'm not doing so well.

3261
02:08:48,630 --> 02:08:49,070
Okay.

3262
02:08:49,950 --> 02:08:50,770
Oh my god.

3263
02:08:50,810 --> 02:08:52,530
There's like these little mosquitoes too.

3264
02:08:53,350 --> 02:08:54,350
Alright, I'm okay now.

3265
02:08:57,490 --> 02:08:59,470
Okay, I need to grab some...

3266
02:09:02,210 --> 02:09:02,450
Oh, shit.

3267
02:09:02,610 --> 02:09:03,250
Oh, shit.

3268
02:09:05,770 --> 02:09:06,610
Wait, what's this?

3269
02:09:07,950 --> 02:09:09,250
Oh, that's an eye.

3270
02:09:10,590 --> 02:09:11,030
Alright.

3271
02:09:11,910 --> 02:09:12,830
What is that?

3272
02:09:14,510 --> 02:09:15,790
Oh, there's no more healers.

3273
02:09:15,790 --> 02:09:15,970
Nice.

3274
02:09:16,170 --> 02:09:17,030
What does this do?

3275
02:09:17,530 --> 02:09:18,810
A resurrection stone?

3276
02:09:19,010 --> 02:09:20,290
Oh, does this resurrect you guys?

3277
02:09:21,890 --> 02:09:22,330
Okay.

3278
02:09:22,790 --> 02:09:23,390
Come here.

3279
02:09:23,450 --> 02:09:23,850
I got this.

3280
02:09:25,830 --> 02:09:26,270
Alright.

3281
02:09:29,270 --> 02:09:29,910
We're fine.

3282
02:09:30,890 --> 02:09:31,890
We're fine, guys.

3283
02:09:33,010 --> 02:09:33,490
Alright.

3284
02:09:33,610 --> 02:09:34,510
Let's find an arena.

3285
02:09:35,830 --> 02:09:36,690
Oh, what's this?

3286
02:09:38,310 --> 02:09:38,790
Ooh!

3287
02:09:40,570 --> 02:09:43,130
Okay, it's time for Tetris.

3288
02:09:56,010 --> 02:09:56,970
Alright, guys.

3289
02:09:57,230 --> 02:09:58,070
You guys ready to fight?

3290
02:09:59,910 --> 02:10:01,830
One person... one person here.

3291
02:10:02,250 --> 02:10:03,730
One person stand here.

3292
02:10:04,550 --> 02:10:06,890
And the other guy kill this first.

3293
02:10:08,570 --> 02:10:11,550
Alright, let's get rid of everything first before we kill any...

3294
02:10:11,550 --> 02:10:12,750
before you guys fight.

3295
02:10:13,270 --> 02:10:15,930
Let's make sure the arena is...

3296
02:10:15,930 --> 02:10:16,790
is clean.

3297
02:10:18,390 --> 02:10:18,950
Alright.

3298
02:10:20,230 --> 02:10:21,390
Get rid of him.

3299
02:10:21,470 --> 02:10:21,670
See?

3300
02:10:21,750 --> 02:10:22,270
I'm contributing.

3301
02:10:23,070 --> 02:10:23,910
I'm making...

3302
02:10:23,910 --> 02:10:24,390
Alright, guys.

3303
02:10:24,470 --> 02:10:25,950
The other person stand here.

3304
02:10:26,710 --> 02:10:27,270
Okay?

3305
02:10:28,170 --> 02:10:29,270
You stand there.

3306
02:10:29,370 --> 02:10:29,610
Alright.

3307
02:10:29,910 --> 02:10:30,890
Let me make a pool first.

3308
02:10:31,030 --> 02:10:31,730
I'm gonna make a...

3309
02:10:31,730 --> 02:10:32,010
Whoa!

3310
02:10:32,710 --> 02:10:33,270
Okay.

3311
02:10:33,330 --> 02:10:33,910
Give me a sec.

3312
02:10:35,090 --> 02:10:37,290
Get rid of all of these guys.

3313
02:10:38,890 --> 02:10:39,450
Alright.

3314
02:10:39,710 --> 02:10:40,270
Alright.

3315
02:10:40,510 --> 02:10:41,010
Alright.

3316
02:10:42,470 --> 02:10:43,030
Alright.

3317
02:10:43,070 --> 02:10:43,930
I'm gonna make a pool.

3318
02:10:44,270 --> 02:10:45,590
Fox versus kitty.

3319
02:10:46,330 --> 02:10:46,890
Alright.

3320
02:10:47,970 --> 02:10:49,390
Fox versus kitty.

3321
02:10:51,730 --> 02:10:55,130
Fox goon versus kitty goon.

3322
02:10:55,310 --> 02:10:56,510
Who will win?

3323
02:10:56,830 --> 02:10:58,370
Fox kitty.

3324
02:11:00,150 --> 02:11:00,750
Alright.

3325
02:11:00,830 --> 02:11:01,790
The moment...

3326
02:11:01,790 --> 02:11:05,250
The moment I throw this torch, you fight.

3327
02:11:05,690 --> 02:11:06,290
Okay?

3328
02:11:06,650 --> 02:11:08,970
The moment I throw this torch.

3329
02:11:09,210 --> 02:11:11,090
Oh, it looks like kitty goon is winning.

3330
02:11:11,550 --> 02:11:12,710
Whoa, box.

3331
02:11:12,970 --> 02:11:14,170
I don't know, box.

3332
02:11:14,570 --> 02:11:17,930
It looks like kitty seems to have the popular appeal.

3333
02:11:18,190 --> 02:11:18,670
Alright.

3334
02:11:18,930 --> 02:11:19,530
Three.

3335
02:11:19,950 --> 02:11:20,550
Two.

3336
02:11:20,850 --> 02:11:21,450
One.

3337
02:11:22,050 --> 02:11:22,650
Fight!

3338
02:11:24,670 --> 02:11:25,270
Whoa.

3339
02:11:26,070 --> 02:11:26,670
Whoa.

3340
02:11:26,750 --> 02:11:27,750
Look at them go.

3341
02:11:27,870 --> 02:11:28,150
Whoa.

3342
02:11:28,290 --> 02:11:28,630
Whoa.

3343
02:11:30,230 --> 02:11:32,590
Tyrone will not beat me.

3344
02:11:32,930 --> 02:11:35,290
What is this fucking...

3345
02:11:35,290 --> 02:11:35,710
Whoa!

3346
02:11:37,690 --> 02:11:38,710
Holy shit!

3347
02:11:39,550 --> 02:11:41,410
And it does nothing!

3348
02:11:42,090 --> 02:11:44,170
Oh, and then kitty freezes him!

3349
02:11:44,530 --> 02:11:46,290
He's sending lightning over!

3350
02:11:46,690 --> 02:11:49,770
Kitty is going into panther form and running away!

3351
02:11:50,390 --> 02:11:52,710
Like the little bitch he is!

3352
02:11:53,050 --> 02:11:55,550
Fox is scouting it out right now.

3353
02:11:55,710 --> 02:11:59,010
Kitty hasn't done barely any damage!

3354
02:11:59,930 --> 02:12:01,590
Kitty, what the fuck is...

3355
02:12:01,590 --> 02:12:01,850
Alright,

3356
02:12:05,390 --> 02:12:05,570
guys!

3357
02:12:05,810 --> 02:12:06,290
Stop!

3358
02:12:06,370 --> 02:12:07,130
Stop the fight!

3359
02:12:07,230 --> 02:12:07,970
Stop the fight!

3360
02:12:08,290 --> 02:12:10,310
I didn't stop the fight, guys!

3361
02:12:12,470 --> 02:12:12,730
Circle!

3362
02:12:13,210 --> 02:12:15,270
I didn't get in the circle!

3363
02:12:18,240 --> 02:12:19,060
Alright, guys.

3364
02:12:19,100 --> 02:12:20,260
I didn't realize there's a zone.

3365
02:12:20,540 --> 02:12:21,840
Fight has paused.

3366
02:12:22,080 --> 02:12:23,280
Pause the fight, everybody.

3367
02:12:23,700 --> 02:12:25,980
We need to get in zone.

3368
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:27,260
Guys, we...

3369
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:32,760
I didn't realize there's a fucking...

3370
02:12:33,160 --> 02:12:35,120
There's a fucking zone here.

3371
02:12:35,700 --> 02:12:36,260
Okay.

3372
02:12:38,380 --> 02:12:39,060
Alright.

3373
02:12:39,280 --> 02:12:40,680
I don't know, guys.

3374
02:12:40,740 --> 02:12:46,520
I feel like Box won after all that third party by the zone.

3375
02:12:47,080 --> 02:12:49,280
I feel like Box is gonna win, too.

3376
02:12:52,300 --> 02:12:54,740
And the zone wins!

3377
02:12:55,100 --> 02:12:56,120
No, but...

3378
02:12:56,120 --> 02:12:59,120
The house wins in the end.

3379
02:13:01,680 --> 02:13:05,560
Wait, this is the same sorcerer from that dark and darker.

3380
02:13:07,280 --> 02:13:08,960
Looks exactly the same.

3381
02:13:11,080 --> 02:13:11,820
Wait, wait, wait.

3382
02:13:13,680 --> 02:13:14,940
What portal is that?

3383
02:13:16,400 --> 02:13:17,920
What's that red thing?

3384
02:13:20,360 --> 02:13:22,480
Wait, what's that red thing in front of me?

3385
02:13:25,200 --> 02:13:26,100
What is this?

3386
02:13:28,640 --> 02:13:29,480
What is that?

3387
02:13:32,940 --> 02:13:33,420
What?

3388
02:13:34,720 --> 02:13:36,580
There's like a red... Oh, is it this?

3389
02:13:37,880 --> 02:13:38,800
What is that?

3390
02:13:44,180 --> 02:13:44,620
Whoa.

3391
02:13:44,820 --> 02:13:45,600
Hey there.

3392
02:13:48,060 --> 02:13:48,500
Alright.

3393
02:13:49,460 --> 02:13:50,760
Oh, is that a bug?

3394
02:13:51,040 --> 02:13:51,280
Oh.

3395
02:13:52,380 --> 02:13:55,880
Yeah, but on my map, there's like a red portal, so I was like confused.

3396
02:13:56,840 --> 02:13:57,740
Is it this?

3397
02:13:59,560 --> 02:14:01,540
I'm like, what the fuck is that red portal?

3398
02:14:04,200 --> 02:14:04,640
Alright.

3399
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:06,500
Guys, I don't know.

3400
02:14:06,560 --> 02:14:07,600
It feels like...

3401
02:14:07,600 --> 02:14:10,040
It really did feel like, you know...

3402
02:14:11,420 --> 02:14:12,740
Kitty might have lost.

3403
02:14:16,360 --> 02:14:17,620
I don't know.

3404
02:14:18,140 --> 02:14:19,460
I don't know.

3405
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:21,880
Oh, that's what it was.

3406
02:14:23,100 --> 02:14:25,440
Oh, wait, how do you get inside that?

3407
02:14:28,260 --> 02:14:29,820
How do you get inside that?

3408
02:14:31,380 --> 02:14:32,440
What is this?

3409
02:14:33,760 --> 02:14:35,040
Nah, run it back.

3410
02:14:35,040 --> 02:14:36,640
Alright, guys, we're gonna run it back.

3411
02:14:37,400 --> 02:14:37,920
Alright.

3412
02:14:39,480 --> 02:14:40,000
Alright.

3413
02:14:41,280 --> 02:14:42,100
Right here.

3414
02:14:42,620 --> 02:14:43,320
Right here.

3415
02:14:43,440 --> 02:14:44,740
Alright, Kitty, you stand here.

3416
02:14:45,240 --> 02:14:45,600
Hmm.

3417
02:14:46,340 --> 02:14:46,860
Box.

3418
02:14:47,540 --> 02:14:48,060
Rematch.

3419
02:14:48,100 --> 02:14:49,780
Box, you stand over here.

3420
02:14:51,140 --> 02:14:51,660
Box.

3421
02:14:53,200 --> 02:14:53,720
Alright.

3422
02:14:54,540 --> 02:14:56,520
We have... Still have time.

3423
02:14:56,680 --> 02:14:59,740
The moment I throw this, we start the fight.

3424
02:14:59,820 --> 02:15:01,080
The rematch.

3425
02:15:01,200 --> 02:15:01,640
Three.

3426
02:15:01,640 --> 02:15:02,880
Two.

3427
02:15:03,440 --> 02:15:04,080
One.

3428
02:15:05,960 --> 02:15:07,120
I'm grabbing this.

3429
02:15:09,540 --> 02:15:10,180
Whoa!

3430
02:15:10,760 --> 02:15:12,520
The lightning strike!

3431
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:15,720
The first lightning strike!

3432
02:15:15,980 --> 02:15:17,320
Oh, what's Box gonna do?

3433
02:15:18,080 --> 02:15:20,800
They're just looking at each other menacingly.

3434
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:22,640
What are they gonna do?

3435
02:15:25,500 --> 02:15:26,440
Are they...

3436
02:15:27,440 --> 02:15:28,100
Are they just...

3437
02:15:28,100 --> 02:15:28,840
They're just...

3438
02:15:28,840 --> 02:15:34,440
And Kitty runs off!

3439
02:15:40,240 --> 02:15:42,500
And Kitty leaves!

3440
02:15:48,620 --> 02:15:50,580
But joke's on you!

3441
02:15:50,760 --> 02:15:53,020
It was just a joke!

3442
02:15:53,380 --> 02:15:55,140
He's back for more!

3443
02:15:55,380 --> 02:15:56,520
And he's gone.

3444
02:15:56,820 --> 02:15:57,640
And he's gone.

3445
02:15:59,980 --> 02:16:00,660
Tactical.

3446
02:16:00,840 --> 02:16:02,920
And he's gone!

3447
02:16:03,280 --> 02:16:04,900
And he's gone.

3448
02:16:05,100 --> 02:16:05,880
Oh my god!

3449
02:16:06,020 --> 02:16:07,460
But Box doesn't care!

3450
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:09,200
He's here for more!

3451
02:16:09,660 --> 02:16:11,320
He's bloodthirsty.

3452
02:16:11,320 --> 02:16:12,820
Oh, we gotta head over there.

3453
02:16:12,920 --> 02:16:14,320
And Kitty leaves again!

3454
02:16:15,620 --> 02:16:16,920
Goodbye, Kitty!

3455
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:21,080
And then Box is also retrieving.

3456
02:16:21,580 --> 02:16:24,000
And I'm gonna open this portal.

3457
02:16:26,120 --> 02:16:27,660
And he leaves!

3458
02:16:28,060 --> 02:16:29,220
And I'm like...

3459
02:16:32,800 --> 02:16:35,240
You two better be fighting!

3460
02:16:36,520 --> 02:16:37,880
What the f-

3461
02:16:48,360 --> 02:16:49,240
I...

3462
02:16:52,810 --> 02:16:55,490
I had fuckin' just...

3463
02:16:55,490 --> 02:16:56,170
I

3464
02:17:00,040 --> 02:17:02,520
can't...

3465
02:17:02,520 --> 02:17:05,040
I can't believe he just did that!

3466
02:17:05,500 --> 02:17:08,260
I can't believe he...

3467
02:17:08,260 --> 02:17:09,160
I...

3468
02:17:09,160 --> 02:17:12,220
He just ran off and took the portal?

3469
02:17:12,500 --> 02:17:13,640
Right and left!

3470
02:17:13,660 --> 02:17:14,680
Right in front of us!

3471
02:17:14,720 --> 02:17:16,700
We got a bot in the escape!

3472
02:17:18,420 --> 02:17:24,060
I think that's payback for...

3473
02:17:24,860 --> 02:17:28,280
I'm pretty sure that was payback for what we did earlier.

3474
02:17:29,440 --> 02:17:31,760
For the first fight, I'm pretty sure.

3475
02:17:33,280 --> 02:17:35,800
The brave is war.

3476
02:17:36,420 --> 02:17:43,720
That has to be... that has to be... only zero escape portal left?

3477
02:17:44,140 --> 02:17:45,680
What do you mean?

3478
02:17:45,860 --> 02:17:49,000
That was literally only one escape portal?

3479
02:17:49,360 --> 02:17:51,240
What do you mean?

3480
02:17:52,760 --> 02:17:54,200
Holy shit!

3481
02:17:55,440 --> 02:17:58,600
Oh my god, I can't believe that happened!

3482
02:17:58,980 --> 02:18:02,460
Bro, I can't believe that happened, bugs!

3483
02:18:03,240 --> 02:18:06,100
I can't believe people leave us like that!

3484
02:18:08,120 --> 02:18:11,140
Oh my god, we don't have an escape...

3485
02:18:11,560 --> 02:18:11,720
portal.

3486
02:18:12,300 --> 02:18:14,460
Oh my god!

3487
02:18:14,580 --> 02:18:16,700
I can't believe it!

3488
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:19,580
That's actually crazy!

3489
02:18:22,740 --> 02:18:28,860
Do you think that was like... do you think that was karma for what we did earlier, chat?

3490
02:18:30,640 --> 02:18:37,180
Do you guys think that was karma for what we did earlier when we left him to die there?

3491
02:18:41,560 --> 02:18:43,200
No way, right?

3492
02:18:43,240 --> 02:18:45,260
No way, man!

3493
02:18:45,460 --> 02:18:46,680
There's no way!

3494
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:54,380
There's no way!

3495
02:18:57,100 --> 02:18:57,740
Okay.

3496
02:18:59,580 --> 02:19:00,560
Oh no.

3497
02:19:01,100 --> 02:19:02,020
Oh no.

3498
02:19:03,380 --> 02:19:04,620
Fox, I swear!

3499
02:19:04,700 --> 02:19:06,640
Fox, I swear to god, Fox!

3500
02:19:07,560 --> 02:19:08,700
Fox, please!

3501
02:19:08,700 --> 02:19:10,020
Fox, please!

3502
02:19:10,280 --> 02:19:12,100
Don't do this to me, Fox!

3503
02:19:18,940 --> 02:19:20,940
I swear to god!

3504
02:19:21,480 --> 02:19:26,660
I swear to god!

3505
02:19:26,660 --> 02:19:26,980
I swear to god!

3506
02:19:26,980 --> 02:19:27,120
I swear to god!

3507
02:19:27,460 --> 02:19:27,640
I swear to god!

3508
02:19:27,760 --> 02:19:32,280
I swear to god!

3509
02:19:32,580 --> 02:19:33,240
Yay!

3510
02:19:35,740 --> 02:19:37,560
You have won!

3511
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:39,720
Alright, bugs, it's just you.

3512
02:19:41,680 --> 02:19:43,220
It's just you and I.

3513
02:19:44,620 --> 02:19:47,600
Oh, he's just going to die with the...

3514
02:19:47,600 --> 02:19:49,780
Fox, you have so much to live for!

3515
02:19:49,880 --> 02:19:50,440
Fox!

3516
02:19:50,560 --> 02:19:53,580
You have so much to live for!

3517
02:19:54,140 --> 02:19:55,820
You don't, Fox!

3518
02:19:56,320 --> 02:19:59,000
You have so much to live for!

3519
02:20:02,040 --> 02:20:04,960
Fox, don't!

3520
02:20:04,960 --> 02:20:06,260
Don't do this to yourself!

3521
02:20:06,460 --> 02:20:07,380
Find the portal!

3522
02:20:07,380 --> 02:20:09,680
There's still hope!

3523
02:20:10,060 --> 02:20:11,580
There's still hope!

3524
02:20:11,740 --> 02:20:12,080
There's still hope for you!

3525
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:16,620
He has nothing left to live for.

3526
02:20:16,920 --> 02:20:19,220
Fox, I believe in you!

3527
02:20:20,060 --> 02:20:26,480
Despite everybody voting against you in the poll, there's still hope!

3528
02:20:27,040 --> 02:20:28,560
You got this!

3529
02:20:28,900 --> 02:20:30,040
I believe!

3530
02:20:31,880 --> 02:20:34,100
You can finally exit!

3531
02:20:34,220 --> 02:20:35,120
There's no way!

3532
02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:37,400
There's literally two more portals!

3533
02:20:38,860 --> 02:20:41,200
There's so many portals for you, Box!

3534
02:20:41,400 --> 02:20:41,700
Look!

3535
02:20:41,960 --> 02:20:42,980
There it is!

3536
02:20:43,440 --> 02:20:44,120
See?

3537
02:20:44,340 --> 02:20:46,360
I believed in Fox.

3538
02:20:46,480 --> 02:20:48,560
Box, I believe in him.

3539
02:20:49,740 --> 02:20:52,760
I 100% believed in this man.

3540
02:20:56,280 --> 02:20:57,200
Let's go!

3541
02:21:01,620 --> 02:21:07,280
I can't believe Kitty fucking took the portal!

3542
02:21:07,320 --> 02:21:09,160
I can't believe it!

3543
02:21:09,280 --> 02:21:11,600
That fucking coward!

3544
02:21:12,160 --> 02:21:15,440
I can't believe he did that!

3545
02:21:15,580 --> 02:21:17,240
That's actually crazy!

3546
02:21:17,800 --> 02:21:19,100
Holy shit!

3547
02:21:19,220 --> 02:21:19,640
Kitty!

3548
02:21:19,720 --> 02:21:20,060
Okay!

3549
02:21:21,060 --> 02:21:21,580
Kitty!

3550
02:21:21,740 --> 02:21:22,620
Okay, Kitty!

3551
02:21:22,740 --> 02:21:23,400
Explain!

3552
02:21:25,080 --> 02:21:25,600
Explain!

3553
02:21:25,820 --> 02:21:26,700
Explain!

3554
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:28,900
Explain yourself, Kitty!

3555
02:21:33,200 --> 02:21:37,020
Kitty doesn't play by your system in your sick games!

3556
02:21:38,520 --> 02:21:40,240
Tyrone's scared!

3557
02:21:49,640 --> 02:21:51,240
Tyrone's scared!

3558
02:21:51,900 --> 02:21:53,540
That's getting unfair!

3559
02:22:01,660 --> 02:22:03,280
Guys, he was scared.

3560
02:22:03,500 --> 02:22:04,720
He was scared, okay?

3561
02:22:08,300 --> 02:22:08,820
Understood!

3562
02:22:09,740 --> 02:22:10,780
Honestly fair!

3563
02:22:14,720 --> 02:22:15,760
God, bro!

3564
02:22:15,920 --> 02:22:17,700
It's understandable!

3565
02:22:18,780 --> 02:22:19,800
Holy shit!

3566
02:22:20,020 --> 02:22:20,680
That was fun!

3567
02:22:20,880 --> 02:22:21,300
It's alright!

3568
02:22:21,680 --> 02:22:22,820
We're gonna call it here!

3569
02:22:22,940 --> 02:22:27,920
That was a good game to end it on, guys!

3570
02:22:28,020 --> 02:22:28,540
That was a good game to end it on, guys!

3571
02:22:28,560 --> 02:22:29,780
That was actually...

3572
02:22:29,780 --> 02:22:31,340
That was fun!

3573
02:22:31,500 --> 02:22:32,600
I had a great time!

3574
02:22:35,080 --> 02:22:36,360
Poor box!

3575
02:22:36,640 --> 02:22:38,720
Box absolutely got...

3576
02:22:38,720 --> 02:22:40,980
That box lost so much!

3577
02:22:43,420 --> 02:22:44,740
Oh my god!

3578
02:22:45,920 --> 02:22:46,720
GG's, guys!

3579
02:22:47,500 --> 02:22:48,760
GG's, Dragoons!

3580
02:22:49,480 --> 02:22:50,300
Oh, man!

3581
02:22:50,500 --> 02:22:51,480
We might not...

3582
02:22:52,500 --> 02:22:56,500
We might not have been able to hunt any bounties today, but...

3583
02:22:56,500 --> 02:22:57,780
That was really fun!

3584
02:22:57,780 --> 02:23:01,020
I had a great time playing Dungeon Born and like...

3585
02:23:01,940 --> 02:23:04,800
Just fucking around in Dungeon Born today!

3586
02:23:05,900 --> 02:23:08,100
Pour one out for pro!

3587
02:23:08,280 --> 02:23:12,680
I feel like Box was the one that lost the most out of all of us.

3588
02:23:13,510 --> 02:23:14,580
Oh my god!

3589
02:23:14,680 --> 02:23:16,080
He lost 40k!

3590
02:23:16,760 --> 02:23:17,520
Oh, stop!

3591
02:23:18,100 --> 02:23:19,460
Stop that, bad guys!

3592
02:23:19,840 --> 02:23:21,740
Only 40k, guys!

3593
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:22,180
It's alright!

3594
02:23:22,480 --> 02:23:24,040
It's just the 40k!

3595
02:23:27,680 --> 02:23:28,460
It's okay!

3596
02:23:28,560 --> 02:23:28,820
It's okay, guys!

3597
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:30,000
He can get it back!

3598
02:23:30,220 --> 02:23:31,200
I believe in him!

3599
02:23:31,420 --> 02:23:32,860
I believe in Box!

3600
02:23:34,040 --> 02:23:34,560
Guys...

3601
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:36,360
Alright, guys.

3602
02:23:36,600 --> 02:23:37,660
But that was so fun!

3603
02:23:37,940 --> 02:23:39,240
Thank you, everybody, for watching!

3604
02:23:39,540 --> 02:23:41,040
I do have a second stream.

3605
02:23:41,580 --> 02:23:44,600
I do have a second stream today.

3606
02:23:44,780 --> 02:23:47,220
It's a member stream and we're going to be doing a watch-along!

3607
02:23:47,480 --> 02:23:49,780
I hope you guys had a great time watching today!

3608
02:23:50,540 --> 02:23:55,780
As always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture changed, get up and move around to get that blood flowing!

3609
02:23:55,880 --> 02:23:58,360
And if you stayed up for me, head to bed!

3610
02:23:58,540 --> 02:23:59,920
Because you deserve it!

3611
02:24:00,160 --> 02:24:01,380
I'll see you guys next time, everybody!

3612
02:24:02,040 --> 02:24:02,700
Bye, guys!

3613
02:24:03,360 --> 02:24:04,040
Bye-bye!
