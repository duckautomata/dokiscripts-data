1
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,980
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,660
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,400
Do I sound better now?

4
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,040
Guys, do I sound better now?

5
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,400
I don't know.

6
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:13,940
I dug through the grave of old PC-Kun and managed to find the old sound settings.

7
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,580
So I need to know if I'm better now.

8
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,380
If everything sounds better.

9
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,020
Oh my god.

10
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,460
Yes, but a bit loud.

11
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,160
Okay, let me adjust that real quick.

12
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,200
How do I do that?

13
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:38,140
Oh wait, I can turn this down to... there.

14
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,540
Is that better?

15
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,860
Is that better everybody?

16
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,680
Am I still loud?

17
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,920
I'm always loud.

18
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:48,020
Like, you telling me like, Doki, you're just a bit too loud.

19
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,380
That's just saying, Doki, stop breathing air.

20
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,540
I don't know.

21
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,940
Is Sound Guy here?

22
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,900
Guys, I'm just a mess.

23
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,060
Okay, you aren't loud.

24
00:02:59,260 --> 00:02:59,700
Okay, good.

25
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,500
Okay, Sound Guy says I'm not loud, so I'll put it back to 100%.

26
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,480
Alright, nice.

27
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,880
Do I sound the same?

28
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:05,740
Sound Guy.

29
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,320
Do I sound like I sound like on PC-Kun?

30
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,840
May he rest in peace.

31
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,920
I now have a hotter younger voice.

32
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,520
I'm a younger version of you, but like, I still miss you.

33
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,980
Like, I'm not gonna forget the memories you've given me.

34
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,760
Oh my god.

35
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,160
It's been... it's been wild.

36
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,780
There's so many announcements.

37
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,760
So, if you guys didn't know, if you guys didn't follow...

38
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,540
I need like... there's so many announcements I need to make on...

39
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,500
I need to make on the community post on YouTube.

40
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,280
Because it's building up.

41
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,200
There's a lot of conventions.

42
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,880
A lot of world tour stuff for conventions.

43
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,960
Um... a lot of...

44
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,920
Uh... a lot of like, announcements.

45
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,100
A lot of merch coming out.

46
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,380
So if you guys didn't follow me on Twitter, uh...

47
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,320
Today, Hiya and IPP have announced, uh...

48
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,040
Uh, that I will be at Anime Expo.

49
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,640
Remember during the charity event thing?

50
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,420
Uh... where I was like, hey guys, I'm gonna be...

51
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,180
Um... I'm gonna be... I'm gonna be at the...

52
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:13,960
Anime Expo.

53
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,140
This is what it is.

54
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,780
I'll be at Anime Expo.

55
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:21,480
Um... at first it was originally like, you know, I'll just be there for July 4th to 6th.

56
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,900
Because that's when Anime Expo is gonna be.

57
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,820
And then they realized, wait, it's your birthday!

58
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,340
On July 4th!

59
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:26,620
Yes!

60
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,060
My real birthday.

61
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:36,540
For those who don't know, July 4th is my actual real birthday.

62
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,500
Because you're like, wait a minute Doki, didn't you celebrate your birthday like...

63
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,020
Like a couple of months?

64
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,340
No.

65
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,680
This is my real birthday.

66
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,180
So... so...

67
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,680
On July 4th, I will be celebrating my...

68
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,920
Uh... one of my five real birthdays.

69
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,960
Um... and uh...

70
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,260
Uh... IVP and Hyatt found out.

71
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,480
They're like, wait, July 4th is your real birthday!

72
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,820
I was like, yeah!

73
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,020
They go, yeah.

74
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,060
And then they're like, why don't we like...

75
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,440
Make the booth like decorated to a birthday theme for you!

76
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,860
Which was really sweet.

77
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,840
They didn't have to.

78
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,540
Like I was just gonna be there as a guest.

79
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,420
And stuff.

80
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,180
So like, it was really sweet of them to offer to do like a birthday theme for my booth.

81
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,880
Just for like the sake of it just being my birthday.

82
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,060
Because they were just gonna decorate it like Doki theme.

83
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,900
But because they found out it was also my birthday, they were like, we're gonna make it more like celebratory.

84
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,700
To celebrate your birthday and everything.

85
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,480
So it was really sweet!

86
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:44,500
So there's gonna be some announcements at the IVP slash Hyatt booth.

87
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:49,660
But don't worry, like some of these announcements will of course be posted on social media.

88
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,080
Regarding what it is.

89
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,800
Because we're gonna be announcing it at the booth.

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,160
And then like whatever the announcements are, we're gonna be posting it on social media.

91
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,660
I'll also be streaming on my birthday.

92
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,220
So...

93
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,260
So...

94
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,280
So you don't have to worry about that.

95
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,460
I'll also be streaming on my birthday.

96
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,140
After...

97
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,900
Because after the...

98
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,920
I believe it'll be a panel on the 4th.

99
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,560
So after the panel, there will be a birthday stream as well.

100
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,300
For all the dragoons who won't be there.

101
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,920
Because it's gonna be treated like an anime convention.

102
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,640
Like panels and stuff like that.

103
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,780
So whatever I'm doing there is just like the usual.

104
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,200
Like what I usually do for conventions.

105
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,460
So like a panel, a karaoke, and a meet and greet.

106
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,440
So the only bonus is that during the panel though.

107
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,440
I'll be celebrating my birthday.

108
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,280
But I'll still have my regular birthday stream.

109
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:44,960
It's not like...

110
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,040
Oh, like Anime Expo is the birthday stream.

111
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:53,180
There will be a birthday stream after the Anime Expo panel.

112
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,120
That's hosted by...

113
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,660
That's hosted by ibp slash hyatt.

114
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,660
So look forward to that.

115
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,760
What else?

116
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:03,960
U2s!

117
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,580
My U2s figure is out now!

118
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,540
We've almost hit a thousand sales already!

119
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,180
Which is great news!

120
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,180
Thank you so much for supporting my very first figure!

121
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,180
I hope there will be many more to come.

122
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,340
I hope the success of this U2s figure might reflect on more potential collabs in the future.

123
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,300
So please feel free to check out the U2s figure.

124
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,160
And I believe my mod will post a link to it very soon.

125
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,520
It was really funny because like...

126
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,420
Okay, it's a little embarrassing.

127
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,460
Because apparently...

128
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,440
Hyatt and U2s were watching the stream.

129
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,440
So...

130
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:46,980
They were both watching the stream.

131
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,040
Because, you know, after the whole mess earlier...

132
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,720
Regarding, you know, the four Windows 11 keys.

133
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,420
So like, you know...

134
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,440
I finally activated Windows, by the way.

135
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,840
Because they...

136
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,220
Hyatt gave me like extra instructions on how to...

137
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,720
Like being like, oh, go to command.

138
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,780
And type these random magical letters.

139
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,880
And stuff.

140
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,300
And then... so then I did that.

141
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,020
And it worked!

142
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,640
So then... so then they replied.

143
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,760
Now you have three extra keys!

144
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,480
Smile!

145
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:26,240
This is what one of the Hyatt employees...

146
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,540
Or like IPP employees wrote to me.

147
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,780
It was supposed to be a secret!

148
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,180
So now I have three Windows 11 keys.

149
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,040
One of them which I paid $200 for.

150
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,360
Because I was panicking and freaking out.

151
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,320
Because I was like, I have a stream!

152
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,060
But I can't activate my Windows!

153
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,480
What if I just buy a Windows key myself?

154
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,800
Maybe that's the problem.

155
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,460
Maybe that's the issue.

156
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,180
I need to purchase my own Windows key.

157
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,100
And then... yeah.

158
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:07,680
It's okay.

159
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,380
It was $200 Canadian.

160
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,100
Okay, it's not...

161
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,260
It's not as okay.

162
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,160
But like...

163
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,480
At least it was $200 Canadian.

164
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,000
And not $200 American.

165
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:16,540
Anyway.

166
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,540
Also, YouTube was also watching the stream.

167
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,260
Because they were like...

168
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:21,860
Oh yeah!

169
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,360
They were like...

170
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:22,540
Oh yeah!

171
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,260
Did you like...

172
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,620
Did you like...

173
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,240
Give a shout out to the YouTube speaker.

174
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,460
Um...

175
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:29,920
They're like...

176
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,100
Oh!

177
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:30,640
I don't know.

178
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,020
Maybe you did a shout out to the YouTube speaker.

179
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,500
Because it launched yesterday.

180
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,360
Um...

181
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:34,760
What do you...

182
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,220
It's okay if you talk about it on like...

183
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:37,400
You know...

184
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,120
Today's stream.

185
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,500
And then later on they're like...

186
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,080
Never mind.

187
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,360
We saw that we sponsored your funeral.

188
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:42,860
So...

189
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,960
They're like...

190
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,200
Oh, never mind.

191
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,660
We saw that YouTube sponsored the funeral.

192
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,140
So you're good to go.

193
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,020
So...

194
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,880
So...

195
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,500
So...

196
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:57,720
Yay!

197
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,380
My sponsors watch my stream.

198
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,000
They found out that they like, you know...

199
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,360
They accidentally sponsored my PC conspiracy.

200
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,560
Ah ha ha!

201
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,860
This is what the YouTube person said.

202
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,620
I thought it was so funny.

203
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,840
This is what you wanted YouTube.

204
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,360
You got the money.

205
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,980
The best prime spot is like the Super Bowl.

206
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,740
It's like the Super Bowl chat, you know?

207
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,080
But like cheaper!

208
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,360
Anyone would want to sponsor your funeral.

209
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,520
Especially as high prolific as PC-kun chat.

210
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,560
Um, Albert, thank you for the super chat.

211
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,540
Thank you, thank you.

212
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,160
Fahad, thank you for the super chat.

213
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,160
Thank you, thank you.

214
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,900
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

215
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,820
Thank you, thank you.

216
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,900
At the funny Doki figuring from YouTube's description for increased marketing.

217
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,720
Thank you for the super chat.

218
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,020
Thank you, thank you.

219
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,900
Guys, it's so... it's like... it's such a rare opportunity.

220
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,100
How many funerals are you able to legally sponsor, chat?

221
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,280
Just think about it, guys.

222
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,360
It's like prime real estate.

223
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,440
It's... it's... I honestly think it's like the next marketing genius move.

224
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,540
Because it's like... they're dead anyway.

225
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,620
And funerals are so expensive.

226
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,120
But all the family loved ones will be there.

227
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,060
Because they're like, oh, he's dead.

228
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,820
I... you know, I gotta pay my respect.

229
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,200
So it's like... and it's like different demographics too.

230
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:41,500
People from like different ages and demographics will be there.

231
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,380
And you gotta pay for a funeral.

232
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,920
So like, funeral caskets are not cheap.

233
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,760
And you gotta buy land for the grave too.

234
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,300
So like, imagine like, you know, you can grab a sponsor.

235
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,080
And then, you know, sponsored by Coca-Cola.

236
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:04,780
And then Coca-Cola gets a grave spot that's gonna be there for centuries.

237
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,760
Just think about that.

238
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,180
Like, you know, the gravestone with a Coca-Cola emblem on there.

239
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,760
Like, brought to you by Coca-Cola.

240
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,810
And a sponsored casket.

241
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,970
You can paint the casket red.

242
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,510
And like, you know, put the Coca-Cola logo on the top.

243
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:31,990
When you like, you know, after you close the lid on the...

244
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,490
You know, when you pay your respect, the lid's open.

245
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:37,910
And then you close the lid, there's the Coca-Cola logo there.

246
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:38,910
And everything.

247
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,390
And then the casket can be painted red.

248
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:45,910
And you don't have to pay anything because it'll be sponsored by Coca-Cola!

249
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,030
You know?

250
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,190
They're dead already!

251
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,330
And you can serve Coca-Cola at the funeral.

252
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,590
Like the... you know, like those funeral parties.

253
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,370
Okay, I wouldn't... I can't say party.

254
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,410
But...

255
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,870
It's not really... It's not really a party.

256
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:05,070
But like, you know, like the funeral...

257
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,830
Get-together with everybody.

258
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,550
Getting like... I'm going to hell.

259
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:19,310
I'm definitely going to hell with this idea.

260
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,190
The wake!

261
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,930
The wake chat!

262
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,670
The funeral service.

263
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:26,790
Um...

264
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,570
Guys, thank you for the super chat.

265
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:29,710
Thank you, thank you.

266
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:33,490
I can't wait to have a DokiBird sponsored coffin and tombstone.

267
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,490
Wait, that's my...

268
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,650
Oh my god!

269
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,250
Anime!

270
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,890
Anime themed funerals!

271
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:44,130
Like, who wouldn't want to be buried with their own shit?

272
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,870
I need to stop cooking.

273
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,270
I'm sorry, capitalism's got me.

274
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,870
I need... I need to stop cooking.

275
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,410
JJK funeral coffin!

276
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,190
Oh my god!

277
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,550
Buried with your favorite anime.

278
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,770
I mean...

279
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,750
Copyright... It won't be copyright infringement if the company...

280
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,410
The copyright holders make merch out of it.

281
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,110
They just need to sell their likeness to other companies.

282
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:17,170
The funeral partners who would be like official partner with JJK.

283
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,910
Like, imagine a funeral parlor who's...

284
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,990
Literally says, official partner with JJK.

285
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,390
Like, imagine that.

286
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,570
That would be... That would make so much money.

287
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:27,430
Now...

288
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,200
JJ, thank you for the super chat.

289
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:33,640
Thank you.

290
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,160
Thank you.

291
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,040
Partner with Briar's Ice Cream.

292
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,080
We get the money.

293
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:37,800
Cool.

294
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,740
Thank you for the super chat.

295
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,320
Thank you.

296
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:40,920
Thank you.

297
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,620
It would make so... Okay.

298
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,160
You guys might think my idea is ridiculous.

299
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,940
But you know...

300
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,120
Like, maybe in 30 or 40 years...

301
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,780
This will happen.

302
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,200
It might be dystopian now.

303
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,000
You might think it's dystopian now.

304
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,100
But I swear, it's gonna be a fucking money maker.

305
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,350
And like, in 30 to 40 years...

306
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,460
I am...

307
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,470
Like, if I stop streaming in 30 or 40 years...

308
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,580
But then I see the anime like...

309
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:12,120
I see anime themed funerals becoming real.

310
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,520
I'm gonna revive my dead channel.

311
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,840
Just to make a video and be like, I told you so.

312
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,960
And clip this exact moment.

313
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,240
And be like, nobody believe me.

314
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,300
I could be a millionaire.

315
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:36,640
I would have been a fucking millionaire.

316
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,460
But nobody believed in my ideas.

317
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:51,600
So I didn't have the confidence to sell my idea.

318
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,040
And make millions of dollars.

319
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,180
Because my chat didn't believe in me.

320
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,840
Thank you for the super chat.

321
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,320
Thank you.

322
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,020
Thank you.

323
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,000
Razzy.

324
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,600
Can't wait to be lowered into my grave in my doki themed coffin.

325
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,240
While the Santa music plays.

326
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,280
Thank you for the super chat.

327
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:09,880
Thank you.

328
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,520
Thank you.

329
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,340
I am a visionary.

330
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,940
I know where capitalism is going next.

331
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:19,020
But you guys didn't give me the confidence to take this to Shark Tank.

332
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,240
Um...

333
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,460
Shanino, thank you for the super chat.

334
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:22,780
Thank you.

335
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:26,200
I'm imagining a waifu artwork on the casket cover.

336
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:32,600
Look, if people can marry Hatsune Miku, people can be buried with Hatsune Miku.

337
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,780
Think about it.

338
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,900
Sharko, thank you for the super chat.

339
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,340
Thank you.

340
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,420
At my funeral, can I just have your laugh in the background?

341
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,420
As my coffin gets lowered into the crown.

342
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,900
Thank you for the super chat.

343
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,500
Thank you.

344
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,360
Thank you.

345
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:49,980
Anyway.

346
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,560
Okay, sound gap here says I am louder.

347
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,560
Okay, I lowered myself.

348
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,440
Is it better now or should I lower myself a little bit more?

349
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,680
That sounds like a threat.

350
00:16:59,380 --> 00:16:59,820
What?

351
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,720
It's like till death do us part.

352
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,200
Well, like, they had the...

353
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,920
Why can't they get buried with Hatsune Miku?

354
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,980
I don't understand.

355
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,180
And then they can play like Hatsune Miku, like World is Mine or something.

356
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,160
Um, for the funeral song.

357
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,640
Alright, let's actually play Train.

358
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:17,920
Sorry.

359
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,460
Sorry, this was like a...

360
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:24,500
This was a weird tangent to get into before Train Simulator.

361
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,580
But here we are.

362
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,800
Train Simulator.

363
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,320
It's not showing up on the screen for some reason.

364
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,220
Let me make sure it shows up.

365
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,000
Oh my god.

366
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,380
Is this one of those things where it can't be game captured?

367
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,720
I swear to God.

368
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,660
Is this a game that can't be game captured chat?

369
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:42,340
Oh.

370
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,840
Oh my god.

371
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,980
Alright, let me double check.

372
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,300
It could be.

373
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,080
It could be one of those games.

374
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,520
Uh...

375
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:52,780
No?

376
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,000
Alright.

377
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:55,820
Okay.

378
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,320
Academy.

379
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,140
Probably the train should have left 18 minutes ago.

380
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,360
Please.

381
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,380
Please show up on the screen.

382
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,760
I just wanna play video.

383
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,580
Oh, there it is.

384
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,280
Alright, nice.

385
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,640
Alright, it's up.

386
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,600
Alright, guys.

387
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,200
I should totally do this.

388
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,280
Alright, I'm already overwhelmed with how like all of this works.

389
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:29,200
Apparently, it's like just like flight simulator where, uh, where, you know, it's super, it's a very accurate simulator to like driving a train.

390
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,960
So, I'm already a bit overwhelmed.

391
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,380
But I do have the flight simulator experience.

392
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:43,460
So, I should be able to take the things I learned from flight simulator into train simulator.

393
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,920
Because like how hard can driving a train be?

394
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,800
You can literally only go forwards and backwards.

395
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,980
Like there's, you're on a track.

396
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,000
You're not on anything else.

397
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,120
You're literally on a railroad track.

398
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,340
So, like how bad can it be?

399
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,180
Uh, Dr. Cranberry, thank you for the magenta soup.

400
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,460
Thank you, thank you.

401
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,600
Here's to the $15,000 train simulator DLC.

402
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,060
But gotta collect them all.

403
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,660
Thank you for the magenta soup.

404
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,660
Thank you, thank you.

405
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,360
Oh my god, I forgot to put on a hat.

406
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,620
Give me a sec, guys.

407
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,940
I gotta disappear for a little bit.

408
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,860
I forgot.

409
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,720
I forgot to put on my hat, guys.

410
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,300
I bought a hat just for this.

411
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,720
Okay, give me a sec.

412
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,940
How do I do this again?

413
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,120
I'm a professional.

414
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,160
Okay.

415
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,060
Hat.

416
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:30,960
Oh, there it is.

417
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,480
There's my hat.

418
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,120
Okay.

419
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,200
Nice.

420
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,700
I have a hat, guys.

421
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:37,940
Oh, shit.

422
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,060
Where did my hat go?

423
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,640
Okay, I need to be smaller for this hat, though.

424
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,840
God damn it.

425
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,740
All right, there you go.

426
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,780
All right.

427
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,020
It looks a little dumb.

428
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,100
Wait, maybe I should just...

429
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:53,760
Wait, I got an idea.

430
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,600
Okay, you can't see this yet.

431
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,980
You must be like, Doki, what's going on?

432
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,060
We don't know what's happening.

433
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,040
It's okay.

434
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:00,520
It's...

435
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,420
Trust the process.

436
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,940
All right, there you go.

437
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,360
Did it work?

438
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,760
Wait, it's not even attached to me.

439
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,500
Okay, there we go.

440
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,260
Yes.

441
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,960
All right, don't worry.

442
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:10,280
Don't worry.

443
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,400
It's almost done, guys.

444
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,220
It's almost done.

445
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:18,820
It's a little tiny, but like it's not about the size of the hat, chat.

446
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,980
There we go.

447
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,680
Hat,

448
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:25,960
guys.

449
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,480
Everywhere I put it looks so stupid.

450
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,060
This is okay.

451
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,780
Okay, maybe like it's a hat on top of a hat.

452
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:41,520
I don't know.

453
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,540
Maybe that's it.

454
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,380
There we go.

455
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,500
There you go.

456
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,320
It's a hat on top of a hat.

457
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,340
There you go.

458
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,560
That should be better, right?

459
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,820
Maybe a little bit bigger?

460
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:51,960
There we go.

461
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,520
Yeah.

462
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,420
Does that work?

463
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,140
This is...

464
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,680
I should...

465
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,100
Oh, wait.

466
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:00,640
You're right.

467
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,760
Guys, give me a sec.

468
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,260
Whoever said that.

469
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,040
You're a goddamn genius.

470
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,600
You're fucking right, guys.

471
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,720
Give me a sec.

472
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,040
I have a better idea.

473
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,240
I have a better idea.

474
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,540
Give me a sec.

475
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,340
Guys, I'm cooking right now.

476
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,640
Give me a sec.

477
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,960
Okay, there we go.

478
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,120
Oh my god, alright.

479
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:25,780
Alright.

480
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,400
Let's go.

481
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:31,950
Hello.

482
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:32,110
Hello.

483
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,110
Your conductor is here.

484
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,770
Your train conductor is here.

485
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:46,870
But like, okay, the problem, the issue right now is that, am I tall enough to reach the controls?

486
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:50,350
That's the issue right now.

487
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,650
I hope I'll be tall enough to reach the controls today.

488
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:54,890
A little bit lower?

489
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,630
Okay, don't worry sound guy, I got you.

490
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:59,210
Let me check where my sound is at.

491
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,470
I got you guys.

492
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,850
23 minutes and we're not playing the game yet.

493
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,610
This truly is the Doki Bird experience.

494
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:09,250
Get a box to stand on?

495
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,910
Wait, you're so right.

496
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,270
You're so right.

497
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,410
Give me a sec.

498
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:14,850
Give me a sec guys.

499
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,510
Let me box PNG.

500
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:28,030
Let me grab a box right now to stand on so I can reach the controls.

501
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:29,330
Before we go.

502
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:29,830
Before we do anything.

503
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:32,230
Guys, this is very important chat.

504
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:36,690
Like, we gotta be sure that I can reach the controls guys.

505
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,770
We have to be sure about this.

506
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,630
Alright, save image.

507
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,230
Alright, save it.

508
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,010
That's a WebMVP?

509
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:44,690
What?

510
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:50,930
How am I gonna stand on the box if I don't have a box PNG?

511
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:54,530
Alright, we're gonna grab this random Canadian box.

512
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,150
Cause it's transparent.

513
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,250
Oh my god.

514
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,850
It's a WebP file?

515
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:00,950
No!

516
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,210
It's a fake PNG!

517
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:08,250
Guys, we're gonna start the stream soon chat.

518
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:12,410
This is very... I need to be able to see the controls guys.

519
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,210
Do you guys want me to crash?

520
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,610
I need to be able to see the controls!

521
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,770
Alright, is this free?

522
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,350
Is this a real PNG or a fake PNG?

523
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,050
This is... God damn it.

524
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,050
I hate the fake PNG.

525
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:24,850
Please.

526
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:26,290
Please.

527
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,510
All my homies.

528
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,890
All my homies.

529
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:33,130
Hate the fake PNGs.

530
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:33,930
Is this real or fake?

531
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,170
We're gonna find out.

532
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,710
Oh, it's a real PNG.

533
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,330
Let's go.

534
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:38,690
Let's go.

535
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,670
Let's fucking go.

536
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:40,790
Okay.

537
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,270
I'll put it here.

538
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:46,710
And then... guys, I ordered a shipment from Amazon and got a box.

539
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,710
So I can do this gag.

540
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:51,670
There you go.

541
00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:01,050
I got my... I got my little baby booster.

542
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,450
Alright, academy.

543
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:05,690
Whoops.

544
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,170
Okay.

545
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:10,310
I don't know what any of these trains are.

546
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,270
There's too many trains.

547
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:15,450
There's like $1500,000 worth of trains.

548
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,390
What?

549
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:17,610
I don't know.

550
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:17,990
Okay.

551
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,990
I wanna ride the steam train!

552
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,110
So I can be like Choo Choo.

553
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,090
Let's use the coal.

554
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,050
Let's destroy the environment with the coal.

555
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,970
Uh, detective, thank you for the super chat.

556
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:30,370
Thank you.

557
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:30,810
Thank you.

558
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:31,370
Soon when?

559
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,790
Soon this month or soon this year.

560
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,250
Thank you for the super chat.

561
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:35,770
Thank you.

562
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:36,490
Thank you.

563
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:41,330
I wanna... I wanna ride a steam train and use the coal.

564
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,590
Alright, let's see.

565
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,010
Is that it?

566
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,030
Coal for the coal gods.

567
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:49,850
Yes.

568
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,670
Alright, here we go.

569
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:54,910
This should be good.

570
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,610
Oh my god, that's me!

571
00:24:58,850 --> 00:24:59,610
That's me!

572
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,430
That's how I envisioned myself as.

573
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,590
Oh my god!

574
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:04,770
It's beautiful!

575
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,630
Charcoal as well?

576
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,810
Oh my god, that's great.

577
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:16,610
Welcome back to the cab of the BR-4F steam locomotive.

578
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:19,830
There's more to this train than simply starting.

579
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:20,530
And stopping.

580
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:22,990
Wait, B?

581
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,430
I need my controller?

582
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:26,350
Oh god.

583
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:30,870
Alright guys, I thought I could just handle this with mouse and keyboard.

584
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:34,050
Alright, let me plug in my controller.

585
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:35,650
Okay.

586
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:36,310
Oh fuck.

587
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,830
I forgot like...

588
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,910
This PC I need to bend all the way down.

589
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,390
And plug stuff in.

590
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:42,590
Alright, here we go.

591
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,190
Alright, I'm ready.

592
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,410
How do I do this?

593
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:50,950
How do I...

594
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,190
Whoa.

595
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,490
Am I going?

596
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:56,670
Yeah!

597
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,330
Wait, is that it?

598
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,230
Wait, driving a train is so easy!

599
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,570
Is that it?

600
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,850
Do I just...

601
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,790
What am I doing?

602
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:17,490
Lee!

603
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:17,710
Lee!

604
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,010
Is that it?

605
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,850
All you have to do is press all these buttons?

606
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,150
There's no more buttons to...

607
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:24,230
Oh!

608
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,570
I can put my hand...

609
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,540
I reached the fuck...

610
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:29,820
Wow.

611
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,380
I reached the...

612
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,680
I reached the flat destination.

613
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,100
Oh my god, this is so easy!

614
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,060
Wait!

615
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,820
Anybody can be a conductor!

616
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,680
Okay, alright.

617
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,240
I think we're ready for the real deal.

618
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,040
That's all I needed to know.

619
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,780
That's literally...

620
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,760
That's...

621
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,780
Oh wait, you guys can't hear the game?

622
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,360
Oh, whoops!

623
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:04,280
I don't know if the game was quiet or you guys couldn't hear it.

624
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,400
Let me check the output real fast.

625
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:07,960
Guys...

626
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,340
Okay, let's see.

627
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,320
System...

628
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,400
Guys, I told you guys.

629
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,260
My whole sound system is a mess right now.

630
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,080
So...

631
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,540
Oh shit!

632
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,520
Alright.

633
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,780
Let's see.

634
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:19,840
System...

635
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,480
There we go.

636
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,620
Now you should be able to hear it.

637
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,240
Alright.

638
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,920
I think from that...

639
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,120
I think from that, we've like...

640
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,240
accomplished everything we need to accomplish.

641
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,100
Uh, we're guiding like driving trains.

642
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,640
So, is there another steam?

643
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,640
I wanna drive another steam train.

644
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,120
Wait, what's that rail fad?

645
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,400
Someone...

646
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,960
Who made this?

647
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,040
Wait, any steam trains?

648
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,660
How do I find steam?

649
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,040
Okay, steam...

650
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,800
I wanna use coal.

651
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,700
How do I...

652
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,780
Do you want a bullet train?

653
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,040
No, but I wanna use coal.

654
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,320
Coal and charcoal.

655
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,440
What's the point?

656
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,060
What's the point if I can't use coal trains?

657
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,040
This game only has one?

658
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,720
Guys, I need to buy a steam train.

659
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,000
Guys...

660
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,280
Alright.

661
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:14,980
Oh, wait!

662
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,660
That's a steam!

663
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,720
Blue Peter!

664
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,860
That has to be steam!

665
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:19,980
Right?

666
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,720
That looks like charcoal.

667
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,620
She wants to ruin the...

668
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,220
Damn right.

669
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,420
I'm glad you understand.

670
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,060
Alright.

671
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,100
We're gonna...

672
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,940
We're gonna drive the...

673
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,680
The...

674
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,360
The Blue Peter.

675
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,720
And then...

676
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,880
Let's see.

677
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,520
We'll start.

678
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,720
I think that's it, right?

679
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,700
Blue Peter.

680
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,300
Like I said, what's the worst that could happen?

681
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,560
Alright.

682
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,220
Here we go.

683
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,540
What's the worst that can happen, chat?

684
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,820
Hello, driver.

685
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,240
You're in control for the final leg through to Holly Head.

686
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,540
Prepare your local...

687
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,100
Oh my god.

688
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,780
I learned this.

689
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,540
Go.

690
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,100
Go.

691
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,500
Why is it not going?

692
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,760
Go faster.

693
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:10,720
Hello.

694
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,820
Goodbye, lady.

695
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,180
Goodbye.

696
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:13,880
Bye.

697
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:13,980
Bye.

698
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,100
Choo choo train is going forward.

699
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,760
We've done it.

700
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,700
We've done it, guys!

701
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,780
We've done it, Dragonz.

702
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,500
Driving a train.

703
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,220
We did it!

704
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,980
Let's look at the other side of the window.

705
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,740
Oh my God.

706
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,160
Where's my train?

707
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:34,900
Oh my God!

708
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:35,320
Yes!

709
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,120
Air Pollution!

710
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,620
I'm just joking.

711
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,600
I'm not actually cheering on the Polluted Air.

712
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:43,960
Oh my.

713
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,740
Oh my god, that is a lot of smoke.

714
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,200
Guys, I'm only joking guys.

715
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,780
I'm not actually cheering it on.

716
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,540
There's a brake?

717
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,160
Where's the brake?

718
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,160
I don't know what any of these buttons do.

719
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,180
Oh wait, is it this?

720
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:03,940
100?

721
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,380
What is that?

722
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,700
Oh, that has to be the brake, right?

723
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,400
And maybe we'll do 58.

724
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,180
And then...

725
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,360
Oh, Kimmy brought down.

726
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,220
Don't worry, I got you.

727
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,560
Wheel slip?

728
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,760
Oh my god.

729
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,700
Is it this?

730
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,660
What did my wheel slip?

731
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,080
Guys, did I broke my wheel?

732
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,580
Did my wheel die?

733
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:39,240
Legacy realistic driving mode?

734
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,960
Legacy mode selected?

735
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,660
What did I select?

736
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,500
Okay.

737
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,980
Alright, let me bring down the volume.

738
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,000
Sorry for like...

739
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,180
Sorry for like getting you out of the immersion guys.

740
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,000
I need to fix the audio.

741
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,080
You can't adjust the audio?

742
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,220
In your main...

743
00:30:59,220 --> 00:30:59,560
What?

744
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,180
What do you mean I can't adjust the audio?

745
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:03,560
Yeah.

746
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,180
What do you mean?

747
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,180
Why can't I adjust the audio?

748
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,680
Sorry guys.

749
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:14,660
Sorry.

750
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,740
Sorry for the...

751
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,420
Lack of immersion just now.

752
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,380
We'll be back.

753
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,720
Alright, we'll be back with the train services soon.

754
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:22,900
Alright here we are.

755
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,760
I lowered it.

756
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:24,940
Oh shit!

757
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:25,940
Alright, there we are.

758
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:26,840
Did I?

759
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:30,620
Wheeeee!

760
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,440
Weee!

761
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,500
Wheeeeeeeee!

762
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:41,710
What is this?

763
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,630
Load and unload?

764
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:44,750
Wait, what is this?

765
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:44,850
What's this?

766
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:46,990
Lights?

767
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,530
Oh, let's turn on all the lights.

768
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:49,670
What's this?

769
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:50,990
Emergency brake?

770
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,110
Oh shit, sorry!

771
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:53,690
Sorry!

772
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:54,570
No, stop!

773
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,270
Don't brake!

774
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,110
We're going through the tunnels!

775
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,030
I didn't mean to do the emergency brake!

776
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,410
Don't worry, we're burning more coal!

777
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,420
More coal!

778
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,160
More coal!

779
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,770
It's okay, we might have stopped.

780
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:23,450
But the coal engine is going off!

781
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,720
It's okay, I killed the engine?

782
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,580
No, I'm still walking!

783
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,680
Guys, it's okay, I'm still moving forward.

784
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:41,240
I'm just making sure I'm burning all the smoke.

785
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,060
I'm making sure the environment knows I'm coming in.

786
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:59,120
The wind might be losing coal resources, but don't worry, my job here is done!

787
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,760
Choo choo!

788
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,320
Oh my god, I'm upside down!

789
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,760
I'm rolling in coal!

790
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,360
Yeah!

791
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,060
It's okay, if any passengers come, I'll be there.

792
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:25,820
If any passengers are sticking their heads out right now and breathing in all that smoke that's coming out of the train, do not worry.

793
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,020
Your insurance does not cover this.

794
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,160
I'm sorry!

795
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,980
Wait, can I collide into another train?

796
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,300
Oh my god, is that possible?

797
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:42,980
Does any train wanna... Sorry, I have to tab out.

798
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,560
I'm sorry for the immersion.

799
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,380
I have to adjust the volume.

800
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,760
Wait, what happened to my game?

801
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,160
What happened to my game?

802
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,360
Oh my game is freaking out.

803
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,680
Wait, it is possible?

804
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:58,940
Oh my god.

805
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,080
There it is.

806
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,640
There it is.

807
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,820
The smoke is like a balloon, if you think about it.

808
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,780
You can run out of coal?

809
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,540
There's no way you can run out of coal.

810
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,000
I own this train.

811
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,380
There's no way.

812
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,440
Where the rails go?

813
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:14,920
Right there.

814
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,560
I own the rails.

815
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,840
There's no way.

816
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,100
Look at it go!

817
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,780
My beautiful train!

818
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,400
Where?

819
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:30,360
Where does it say my coal is running out?

820
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,500
I see nothing that says that.

821
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,360
What do I know when I arrive?

822
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,260
This is a long train ride.

823
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,320
Faster?

824
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,420
How do I go faster?

825
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,620
Do I put more coal in?

826
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,400
Wait, A?

827
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,500
What's this?

828
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,700
I put more smoke in.

829
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,260
Do I...

830
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:57,080
Can I actually go faster?

831
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,040
Put more coal in it!

832
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,280
Somebody, shovel more coal!

833
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:09,980
Alright, lower the volume a little bit more.

834
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,760
Woo!

835
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,440
Somebody!

836
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:26,540
All I'm saying is that, like, I should own the entire coal... the entire coal industry.

837
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:28,920
Yay!

838
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,940
How am I running out of water?

839
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,120
There's water right here.

840
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,520
There's no way I can stop my train and grab the water at the lake.

841
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,340
How can I run out of water?

842
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,760
This is bad.

843
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,780
The water's low?

844
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,760
How do you know the water's low?

845
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,340
Is it that blue thing right here?

846
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:58,940
Guys, I think the blue thing right here is my water.

847
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,460
Okay, alright, I stopped the coal shoveling.

848
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,320
Oh, I ran... whoops.

849
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:11,320
Guys, guys, why didn't you guys stop me?

850
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,520
Guys!

851
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,100
Why didn't you guys brought more water?

852
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,540
Did I fail?

853
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,040
I... I can fail?

854
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,680
Wait... what?

855
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,760
Oh, wheel slip.

856
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,560
O.P.

857
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:26,920
error.

858
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,440
Wheel slip!

859
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:33,060
Guys, what the fuck does wheel slip even mean?

860
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,500
I don't know about this.

861
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:39,240
If I don't know what error I made, how do I actually made an error?

862
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,700
Like, what?

863
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:46,500
How could I have made an error if I don't even know what the error is?

864
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,320
That's what I'm saying.

865
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,440
If I don't know what my error is, then like, how do you know I failed?

866
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,180
Chat.

867
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,680
How would you know?

868
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,020
Alright, what's a better train?

869
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,580
That was a bad train.

870
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,520
It wasn't a bad conductor.

871
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,660
It was just a terrible train.

872
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:07,840
Uh...

873
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,520
Hahaha!

874
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:10,980
Hahaha!

875
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:16,300
I... There's no... There's no way I could just run out of water.

876
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,820
There was literally a lake next to me.

877
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,980
Like, how could I run out of water when there was a lake next to me?

878
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,660
It was not a conductor issue.

879
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,720
Alright, what's a better train?

880
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,100
That train was just garbage.

881
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,240
Hahaha!

882
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,760
Recommend me your best trains, chat.

883
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,640
Give me your best trains.

884
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,020
Classic blame.

885
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:43,060
It's not a human error because I'm not human.

886
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,240
You can't say that, guys.

887
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:50,000
And if you blame me, then you just hate tomatoes.

888
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,860
Uh, welcome to the...

889
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:52,300
Hahaha!

890
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:54,900
Hahaha!

891
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:57,840
Uh...

892
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,580
Welcome... I bet you're a vegetarian if you're blaming me.

893
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,380
You fucking veggie eater.

894
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,380
Hahaha!

895
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:05,480
Hahaha!

896
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,060
Hahaha!

897
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,620
Hahaha!

898
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:08,900
Rasidazzi!

899
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,220
Welcome to the Dokey uh... train...

900
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,600
Doki track train line.

901
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,240
Whatever you need to do...

902
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,700
Wherever you need to go, we may or may not get there.

903
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,000
Rasidazzi!

904
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:18,560
Thank you!

905
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,560
You're the super chat!

906
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,920
Thank you, thank you!

907
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,460
God damn eating-eating my people.

908
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,380
Alright.

909
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,800
Let's see...

910
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,500
Alright.

911
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,200
What's a better train, guys?

912
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,320
A bullet train?

913
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,460
Aren't those the kind of trains that go really fast?

914
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:35,880
Fast.

915
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,800
Oh, I like those.

916
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,620
My game crashed.

917
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:47,200
I thought I thought we wouldn't have these issues.

918
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:01,290
This must be I think this is an actual game issue.

919
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:02,430
There's no way.

920
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,990
There's no way.

921
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:08,490
I can't.

922
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:10,570
Alright.

923
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:11,510
Let's go pick.

924
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,270
Okay, people said the bullet train.

925
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:14,990
Alright, high speed.

926
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,010
Is this a bullet train?

927
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:18,010
Is that bullet train?

928
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,230
The high speed train?

929
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:24,250
There's no... Okay, at least like it was super boot up fast.

930
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,550
Is that the bullet train?

931
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:29,370
Is your new name wheels... I don't even know what wheelslip is.

932
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:30,710
Is that a good thing?

933
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,730
Haki, thank you for the super chat.

934
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:33,090
Thank you.

935
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,610
Oh, that's a bullet train?

936
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,090
Okay, this time we'll retry this.

937
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,450
I can't run out of water.

938
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:43,490
I can't run out of water for this one because it's not like coal related.

939
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,010
It's a bullet train.

940
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:45,550
It's electricity.

941
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,970
So like where does the water go?

942
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:50,330
Alright.

943
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,130
Hello, driver.

944
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,530
Just taking over from another driver.

945
00:39:54,550 --> 00:40:00,390
So please open up your door and sub a train ahead of a departure at Drizdan.

946
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,090
Have fun.

947
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,290
How do I open my doors?

948
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,250
What is this?

949
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:05,510
Load and unload?

950
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:06,830
Sander?

951
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,790
Uh, lights?

952
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:11,330
Wipers?

953
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,110
What's sander?

954
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:14,910
How do I open my door?

955
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:16,970
2D map?

956
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:19,930
Task log?

957
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:23,550
Uh, couple?

958
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:24,230
Oh!

959
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:25,110
Couple?

960
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:27,930
What do I do here?

961
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,330
Do I take these trains off?

962
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:33,850
Guys, I think I should have...

963
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:35,670
I think I should have went to train school.

964
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,160
Guys.

965
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,520
I think...

966
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,720
I think I should have went to train school, guys.

967
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:48,720
Oh!

968
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:53,210
I can come onto the train!

969
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:55,530
Guys!

970
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:57,230
Get on!

971
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:00,050
Get on the train, everybody!

972
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:03,010
What's the coupling?

973
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,870
What happens if I decouple it?

974
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,970
Oh, is this like...

975
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:13,530
Oh, I guess I'm just gonna decouple it because that's what it was before.

976
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:15,590
Are you guys on the train, guys?

977
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,050
Are you guys on the train now?

978
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:18,690
I can't tell.

979
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,510
I can't tell if you're on the train or not.

980
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:23,330
Guys.

981
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,250
Guys, get on!

982
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:27,330
Guys, come on!

983
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:28,890
Why does nobody wanna...

984
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:31,150
Why does nobody wanna get on the train?

985
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:32,970
Guys!

986
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,470
I don't understand!

987
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:39,390
There's nobody that wants to sit on my train!

988
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,730
I don't need you guys.

989
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,370
I'll just go straight.

990
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:47,830
Timeless.

991
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:49,050
Timeliness.

992
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:49,850
Bonus.

993
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:50,530
Oh!

994
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:52,610
Alright.

995
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:53,910
Choo-choo!

996
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:58,050
Guys, is anybody else on the train with me?

997
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:00,090
Guys?

998
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:03,970
Why does nobody here wanna sit on the train?

999
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:05,890
Come on!

1000
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:07,550
I'm a first...

1001
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:09,370
I might be a first time conductor, but I'm a first time train.

1002
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:10,610
But I know what I'm doing.

1003
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:13,970
Yay!

1004
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:16,050
Tickets!

1005
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,570
Anybody got some tickets?

1006
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:21,290
Tickets!

1007
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:24,570
Tickets, guys!

1008
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:25,970
Beep-beep!

1009
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:29,890
Look!

1010
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:32,510
Oh my god, there's like wipers too.

1011
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:34,510
I can wipe my train.

1012
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:37,550
Guys!

1013
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:39,090
I don't understand, guys.

1014
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:40,190
What is this?

1015
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:42,310
Guys, we're turning on the lights!

1016
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:44,810
Wait, what have I...

1017
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:47,130
What does this even do?

1018
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:48,150
It doesn't even turn it off.

1019
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:50,970
Okay.

1020
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:52,170
Four lights.

1021
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:53,670
Nice knowing dragons.

1022
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:55,890
There's like zero people on this train except for me.

1023
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:59,070
Like, it feels like people don't trust me and I don't know why.

1024
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:00,550
Like...

1025
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:01,910
Oh my god, that's a lot of trains.

1026
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,290
Wait, what have I...

1027
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:04,490
Can I detect something?

1028
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:05,730
Can I detach from the other trains?

1029
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:07,550
Is that possible?

1030
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:09,910
Pick up passengers from...

1031
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:11,070
Oh, I can pick up passengers?

1032
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:12,810
Guys, when do I get there?

1033
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,430
I arrived at 1731.

1034
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:16,790
Oh, I'm speeding?

1035
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:18,490
It's okay.

1036
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:20,290
It's not like I'm gonna crash or anything.

1037
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:21,850
It's a bullet train!

1038
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:22,990
I should be speeding.

1039
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:24,210
What do I do?

1040
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:26,730
Deduct more points and revoke my license?

1041
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:29,270
Faster!

1042
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:36,390
I can't do jack shit!

1043
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:39,150
Wait, I'm gonna make it.

1044
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:40,390
Wait.

1045
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:42,050
Is that where I'm supposed to go?

1046
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:46,110
Guys, is this where I'm supposed to go?

1047
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:47,990
For like my stop?

1048
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:49,670
Okay.

1049
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:51,610
Is that it?

1050
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:52,990
Is that my first stop?

1051
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:56,350
That has to be my first stop, right?

1052
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:58,570
I think I passed it.

1053
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:00,450
Did I pass it?

1054
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:02,610
Where's my first stop?

1055
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:08,410
I can't read the map, guys.

1056
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:12,110
Oh, 400.

1057
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:12,590
Oh!

1058
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:13,830
Oh, okay.

1059
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:14,390
It's 400.

1060
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:15,370
Okay, we go faster.

1061
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:17,630
Uh, I'm not there.

1062
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:19,010
Guys, yell at me when I'm there.

1063
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:20,990
We'll go back to fast then.

1064
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:23,210
Not for...

1065
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:23,450
Oh!

1066
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:25,550
Oh, what the heck happened?

1067
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:27,650
Oh, I accidentally tapped to the next...

1068
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:28,130
Oh, shit.

1069
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:29,050
Oh, shit.

1070
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:30,650
Accidentally tapped to the...

1071
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:32,830
Accidentally tapped to the next window.

1072
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:34,250
My mouse...

1073
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:37,070
My mouse went to the next window.

1074
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:38,750
Alright, that's okay.

1075
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:39,570
That's okay.

1076
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:40,030
We're still...

1077
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:40,790
We're still on it.

1078
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:42,350
We're still on the train.

1079
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:42,570
Wait!

1080
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:43,170
I can detach?

1081
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:44,730
Wait!

1082
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:45,510
Can I det...

1083
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:46,910
What's this?

1084
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:49,250
Can I detach from...

1085
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:50,870
From my other trains?

1086
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:52,210
When my other trains are detached?

1087
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:56,510
What does this do?

1088
00:44:58,410 --> 00:44:59,650
I don't know what I did.

1089
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:02,310
I pieced some stuff together.

1090
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:03,890
I don't know.

1091
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:04,230
I don't know.

1092
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:05,830
I think it'll be fine, right?

1093
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:07,970
I don't know what this does.

1094
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:09,330
But like...

1095
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:11,070
As a train enthusiast...

1096
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:11,910
Wait, no point.

1097
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:13,010
Oh, okay.

1098
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:16,730
I don't know what it does.

1099
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:18,390
But like...

1100
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:19,290
Oh, there it is!

1101
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:20,050
Oh, shit!

1102
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:23,010
Why did you guys...

1103
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:24,650
There's the sub!

1104
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:25,210
No!

1105
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:33,590
I told you guys to tell me!

1106
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:36,150
I told you guys to tell me!

1107
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:39,850
I told you guys to tell me when I need to stop!

1108
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:43,470
Guys!

1109
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:47,070
Why didn't you tell me to stop?

1110
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:47,330
No!

1111
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:51,630
Where's my train?

1112
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:54,170
Where am I?

1113
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:59,070
Oh, there I am.

1114
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:01,150
Alright, that's fine.

1115
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:02,510
We'll like go backwards.

1116
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,170
We'll go backwards.

1117
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:04,710
It's fine.

1118
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:06,990
Emergency brakes...

1119
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:08,090
We can go backwards, right?

1120
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:11,050
Alright, go backwards.

1121
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:13,690
Go backwards.

1122
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:16,210
We gotta pick people up.

1123
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:19,190
Alright, there you go.

1124
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:22,450
My power coins!

1125
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:24,890
Don't worry, I'm coming there!

1126
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:28,210
Wait, I'm not even there?!

1127
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:29,870
Wait, I didn't even miss it?!

1128
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:30,890
But what's that station?

1129
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:33,530
Okay, platform 8.

1130
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:35,630
Where's platform 8?

1131
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:35,870
Hey!

1132
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:38,710
This is not platform A?

1133
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:40,210
Oh!

1134
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:41,470

1135
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:42,890

00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:50,970

1140
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:53,170
Sorry!

1141
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:54,410
I went the wrong way.

1142
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:55,390
Forward!

1143
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:56,150

00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:57,150
Oh shit!

1145
00:46:58,010 --> 00:46:58,570
Forward!

1146
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:01,590
I didn't go forward!

1147
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:02,070
Sorry!

1148
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:03,590
For any passengers...

1149
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:04,330
Oh shit!

1150
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:05,230
There are passengers!

00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:07,390
Dragoon 1!

1152
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:11,770

1153
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:13,450

1154
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:16,310
I knew my dragoons believed in me!

1155
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:18,690

00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:21,290
I knew there were believers!

1157
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:23,650

00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:27,130
There's other dragoons!

I see you!

1161
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:31,330
Am I still going backwards?

1162
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:32,270
This is not good.

1163
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:34,310
Okay, I need a break.

1164
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:35,570
I need a foley break.

00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:36,090

1166
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:38,550

Okay.

1174
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:50,850
And now we go this way.

1175
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:53,450

00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:04,610
What is this?

00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:07,790
Emergency brake... engine start.

Thank you.

00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:28,690
I knew not going to train school was a good idea and was a scam.

1191
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:32,050
I knew train school was a scam all along.

1192
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:34,190
You have passed the signal at danger.

1193
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:34,830

Super chat, thank you.

You know the devs of a simulator are sissies when they don't show the explosions or collisions.

1214
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:03,970

Okay, wait, no.

00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:46,110
Open the doors.

Are people getting on now?

1267
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:50,610

I can't tell.

1270
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:56,990
I can't tell if people are going in or not.

1271
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:02,590
Be not... be not afraid!

1272

00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:06,030
Oh shit, it's raining!

1296
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:07,730
I should like... do the wipers.

1297
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:10,810
There you go.

1298
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:12,870
Whoa, that's a lot of controls.

1299
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:14,110
Whoa!

1300
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:16,110
What does this do?

1301
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:18,590
What is this control?

1302
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,300
I put the bell on, but what does the bell do?

1303
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,660
I don't like that the lights started flashing.

1304
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:29,900
Oh, horn!

1305
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:31,580
Beep!

1306
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:32,920
Beep!

1307
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:35,240
Oh!

1308
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,380
I can't flip those?

1309
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:39,500
Pussies!

1310
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,620
Wait, where's my co-pilot?

1311
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,500
Where's my co-train?

1312
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:46,260
Wait, what's this?

1313
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,740
I acknowledge you.

1314
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:51,980
I acknowledge you.

1315
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,620
What does that do?

1316
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:56,740
Okay.

1317
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,420
I think all of these...

1318
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,120
What's this?

1319
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:02,060
Oh, this has to be like...

1320
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:02,900
Oh, okay.

1321
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:05,000
We gotta go full speed ahead.

1322
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,100
This has to be like...

1323
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:08,960
Oh, that's the release brake?

1324
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,360
Wait, what's this?

1325
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:12,800
What am I doing?

1326
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,100
What is that?

1327
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:19,920
What's that sound?

1328
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:27,180
Guys, I don't know what that sound is.

1329
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:33,120
I heard a sound, but...

1330
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,960
I don't know what that does.

1331
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,620
Oh, that's the brake!

1332
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:37,900
Oh!

1333
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:42,250
Alright.

1334
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:43,810
There we go.

1335
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:46,390
What do you mean aviation disaster?

1336
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:48,850
That fucking plane was Jesus!

1337
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:51,290
That was no disaster.

1338
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:53,570
I think we're gonna be fine.

1339
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:55,670
Let's sit with the people.

1340
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:58,330
Let's let the conductor sit with the people.

1341
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:00,830
Hey guys, you guys having a good time?

1342
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:02,390
Whoa.

1343
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:06,470
Oh my god, look at how fast we're going, guys.

1344
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:07,450
Are you...

1345
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:11,250
Hey, you guys heard of that movie?

1346
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:12,510
Like, Train to Busan?

1347
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:18,510
Good things always happens on trains.

1348
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:21,210
It was like so popular and everything.

1349
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:25,190
And like, it has to be a really good movie about trains then.

1350
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:26,750
If that movie did really well.

1351
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:29,870
Also, that other movie about trains where like...

1352
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:33,110
Like, every population and citizen.

1353
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:34,710
Like...

1354
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:36,070
Um...

1355
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:36,750
You know...

1356
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,090
Wait, are we going?

1357
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:39,650
Wait, why did we stop?

1358
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:42,690
What's going on on the train?

1359
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:43,530
Oh, I actually stopped.

1360
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:44,130
Guys, sorry.

1361
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:47,490
Sorry, the conductor accidentally stopped it.

1362
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:50,470
Because like, she's not at the conductor seat right now.

1363
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:52,150
But don't worry, we're gonna be...

1364
00:55:56,910 --> 00:55:58,430
Don't worry, everything will be fine.

1365
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:00,030
Local break, no breaks.

1366
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:00,870
We don't need breaks.

1367
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:03,430
Wait, why aren't we going forward?

1368
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:04,890
Alright, sorry.

1369
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:06,570
I'm gonna be back with the train.

1370
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:08,590
Like, I'm sorry, I have to do my job again.

1371
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:09,930
Are we...

1372
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:12,150
Wait.

1373
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:13,650
What's going on?

1374
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:15,310
Start.

1375
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:17,670
Start the engine.

1376
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:19,310
Did we run out of power?

1377
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,070
Did we...

1378
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:24,110
Guys.

1379
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,010
What happened?

1380
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:30,010
What happened?

1381
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:34,130
Did I hit something?

1382
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:36,310
There's no way.

1383
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:38,030
Where's the train?

1384
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:41,010
Did I hit something?

1385
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:45,790
Go forward.

1386
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:48,570
Why aren't you going forward?

1387
00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:50,870
Somebody.

1388
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:54,390
Help, the train stopped going forward.

1389
00:56:57,270 --> 00:56:58,450
I had...

1390
00:56:58,450 --> 00:56:59,450
The brakes are off.

1391
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:00,990
What do you mean?

1392
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:03,270
Okay.

1393
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:04,790
Okay, I got this.

1394
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:06,350
I got this.

1395
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:08,010
Maybe it's this.

1396
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:08,870
It has to be.

1397
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:10,350
Is this causing the whole issue?

1398
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:14,030
Is this causing everything?

1399
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:18,730
Why is it negative?

1400
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:20,250
No.

1401
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:21,450
We have to accelerate.

1402
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:24,290
We have to accelerate.

1403
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:26,850
And then...

1404
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:27,750
Go.

1405
00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:28,510
Go.

1406
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:29,490
Go.

1407
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:32,450
Guys.

1408
00:57:34,770 --> 00:57:35,690
Wait for it.

1409
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:36,330
Guys.

1410
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:36,630
Guys.

1411
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:38,110
Guys, we're on a schedule.

1412
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:40,910
My train boss is not going to be happy about this.

1413
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:42,930
We're not moving.

1414
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:45,870
Okay.

1415
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:47,030
Stay calm.

1416
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:48,110
Stay calm.

1417
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:49,250
You won't get fired.

1418
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:50,170
It's your first day.

1419
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:57,530
No, how did I break it?

1420
00:57:57,610 --> 00:57:58,850
I just pressed buttons.

1421
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:03,070
What if I put more sander in it?

1422
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:04,330
I don't know what sander is.

1423
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:06,310
But I'll put more sander in it.

1424
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:06,930
Is that coal?

1425
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:08,650
Put more coal in there.

1426
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:10,330
Do I have gas?

1427
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:13,750
Okay, I have zero power.

1428
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:17,270
But like, that should be okay, right?

1429
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:19,610
Oh no.

1430
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:24,510
But like, how do I have zero power when the wipers are working?

1431
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:29,070
Is it on?

1432
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:32,010
Did I turn the engines off?

1433
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:33,770
Guys!

1434
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,450
Any train conductors?

1435
00:58:35,730 --> 00:58:36,510
Any...

1436
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:43,730
Where are the train conductors?

1437
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:44,950
Guys!

1438
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:49,650
Train conductors, I need help!

1439
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:52,370
Pull over down.

1440
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:53,910
Oh, down?

1441
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:54,970
Okay.

1442
00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:58,350
There.

1443
00:58:58,350 --> 00:59:00,150
Pull over is down.

1444
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:03,890
And then what?

1445
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:05,550
Yellow button?

1446
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:08,630
What does the yellow button even do?

1447
00:59:08,730 --> 00:59:09,290
I just acknowledged.

1448
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:11,470
Red stick?

1449
00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:12,110
Red stick?

1450
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:12,670
Okay.

1451
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:14,310
Alright.

1452
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:15,830
Zero.

1453
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:18,250
Release.

1454
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:21,050
Release!

1455
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:24,030
Release!

1456
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:26,650
Blew up?

1457
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:28,590
Blew up!

1458
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:31,410
Go train!

1459
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:31,810
Go!

1460
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:32,790
Wait!

1461
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:34,890
Wait!

1462
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:38,170
Is my train going?

1463
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:41,090
Am I moving?

1464
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:41,610
I'm moving!

1465
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:43,450
It was the yellow button!

1466
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:49,570
I don't know what it was, but I acknowledged it and then it like, stopped working.

1467
00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:51,710
I don't know what this is.

1468
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:53,650
It was the yellow button.

1469
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:55,290
We're back online!

1470
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:56,750
Nice.

1471
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:57,630
Okay, I knew it.

1472
00:59:58,150 --> 00:59:59,350
Was that the brakes?

1473
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:00,990
Oh, that's the brakes?

1474
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:02,290
Why is it called acknowledge?

1475
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:05,910
I thought it just wanted me to acknowledge it.

1476
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:09,690
Why was it the yellow button?

1477
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:13,450
Alright, nice.

1478
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:14,750
We're back on schedule, guys.

1479
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:16,770
Alright, back with the people.

1480
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:17,670
Hey, guys!

1481
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:19,870
So, like, we had a little...

1482
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:22,570
We had a little issue with the train.

1483
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:25,550
But, like, everything will be okay, dragoons.

1484
01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:26,190
Don't worry.

1485
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:28,270
I know what I was doing.

1486
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:32,030
A dead man switch?

1487
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:36,210
Yeah, Dr. Cranberry, thank you for the super chat.

1488
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:37,050
Thank you, thank you.

1489
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:40,930
The yellow button allows the train to know you care about it and you love it.

1490
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:43,230
Yeah, that's what I thought!

1491
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:46,350
I thought... because it was like, do you want to appreciate the train?

1492
01:00:46,530 --> 01:00:48,810
And I was like, yeah, I appreciate the train.

1493
01:00:49,410 --> 01:00:49,810
Like...

1494
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:55,450
I don't know what dead man switch is.

1495
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:56,790
It just says acknowledge.

1496
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:59,170
And I was like, okay, I acknowledge your existence.

1497
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:05,430
Like, how else was I supposed to know that it's supposed to... it's like, gonna stop my train?

1498
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:07,630
I don't have a co-pilot with me.

1499
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:08,190
I'm lonely.

1500
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:10,230
I'm so lonely.

1501
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:13,750
Wait, we're so slow.

1502
01:01:14,350 --> 01:01:17,550
Who the fuck end up... who stopped my train?

1503
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:20,630
Who stopped my train?

1504
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:23,930
Oh, no.

1505
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:25,510
Wait, why did it stop again?

1506
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:27,750
Did I acknowledge something again?

1507
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:31,350
Who stopped it?

1508
01:01:34,070 --> 01:01:36,630
I left it unattended so it stops?

1509
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:38,630
But I want to be with the people!

1510
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:39,710
I did...

1511
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:41,670
I don't think I did that.

1512
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:49,050
I don't know what you're talking about.

1513
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:50,430
Go forward!

1514
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:53,170
Go!

1515
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:56,930
Move!

1516
01:01:58,990 --> 01:01:59,470
Okay.

1517
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:02,250
We'll put that down here.

1518
01:02:05,950 --> 01:02:06,810
Beep, beep.

1519
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:08,350
Is it the bell?

1520
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:11,870
Maybe I should stop having the bell off.

1521
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:14,990
Or like, no, the bell should be on.

1522
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:17,750
Guys, I stopped moving again.

1523
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:19,050
I stopped...

1524
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:23,910
Guys, I don't understand.

1525
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:25,270
Why did I stop?

1526
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:25,690
No...

1527
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:29,050
I...

1528
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:30,730
I acknowledge you.

1529
01:02:31,370 --> 01:02:32,950
I acknowledge you.

1530
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:35,570
Did it work?

1531
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:38,030
Okay.

1532
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:39,590
Maybe if I turn it on and off.

1533
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:41,590
Maybe...

1534
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:43,610
Okay.

1535
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:44,830
There we go.

1536
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:46,030
I push the button on...

1537
01:02:46,030 --> 01:02:46,770
The blue lever.

1538
01:02:48,790 --> 01:02:49,270
Okay.

1539
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:49,770
Here we go.

1540
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:50,870
I'm putting it at zero.

1541
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:51,110
Zero.

1542
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:54,650
And then...

1543
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:56,590
Boom.

1544
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:01,310
Oh, it's moving again!

1545
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:03,910
Oh no, that's just the rain.

1546
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:05,630
That's just the rain, guys.

1547
01:03:06,410 --> 01:03:08,950
Okay, maybe... Okay, keep everything at zero.

1548
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:11,230
And we're resetting everything, guys.

1549
01:03:11,930 --> 01:03:12,450
Okay.

1550
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:14,350
Zero.

1551
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:16,150
I hope there's no train behind me.

1552
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:17,730
Because that would be awkward.

1553
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:18,830
Alright.

1554
01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:20,650
We'll reset it real fast.

1555
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:21,530
Okay.

1556
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:24,110
Hey guys, so we're gonna have a little delay.

1557
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:26,810
We're gonna... We...

1558
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:30,250
There's like a deer crossing in front of our train right now.

1559
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:33,630
So like, because I am such a humanitarian...

1560
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:35,790
And I don't wanna, you know...

1561
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:36,910
Have bad karma.

1562
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:40,750
We're gonna let some deers cross through the train tracks.

1563
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:44,230
And like, behind the deers, there's also some geese as well.

1564
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:46,570
And a little family of geese in front of us as well.

1565
01:03:46,730 --> 01:03:47,750
And that is why I delay.

1566
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:50,570
And obviously, like, if you guys want me to go forward...

1567
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:52,090
Then you want me to commit animal slaughter.

1568
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:55,570
And you're not that bad of a type of people, dragoons, right?

1569
01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:58,210
So that's why we're gonna experience some...

1570
01:03:58,210 --> 01:03:58,850
Uh...

1571
01:03:58,850 --> 01:04:00,710
Some really, really...

1572
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:01,330
Uh...

1573
01:04:01,330 --> 01:04:02,870
Very tiny delay, guys.

1574
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:03,970
Just very tiny.

1575
01:04:04,370 --> 01:04:05,890
So I hope you all, you guys, understand.

1576
01:04:06,330 --> 01:04:06,810
Alright.

1577
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:08,130
I think they believed it.

1578
01:04:08,810 --> 01:04:09,330
Okay.

1579
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:10,730
Alright.

1580
01:04:10,910 --> 01:04:12,310
That should be enough time, right?

1581
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:13,890
We go forward.

1582
01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:19,070
Guys, I don't understand.

1583
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:21,190
Guys...

1584
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:21,930
Hahaha!

1585
01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:22,770
Hahaha!

1586
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:23,430
Hahaha!

1587
01:04:24,850 --> 01:04:25,250
Hahaha!

1588
01:04:26,590 --> 01:04:27,830
Guys, I don't understand.

1589
01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:30,070
Why isn't my...

1590
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:34,630
Why isn't my train going forward?

1591
01:04:35,810 --> 01:04:37,830
Train should just go forward!

1592
01:04:39,850 --> 01:04:42,010
Maybe turn the brake on and off again?

1593
01:04:43,110 --> 01:04:44,210
Is this the brake?

1594
01:04:44,770 --> 01:04:45,650
Yeah, that's the brake.

1595
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:46,410
Okay.

1596
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:48,130
On...

1597
01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:49,610
I don't know what this is.

1598
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:50,710
But...

1599
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:51,750
On...

1600
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:53,070
And then...

1601
01:04:53,070 --> 01:04:53,670
Off.

1602
01:04:57,290 --> 01:04:58,230
Is that it?

1603
01:04:58,390 --> 01:04:59,510
Am I going forward?

1604
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:01,310
No?

1605
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:02,690
What is this?

1606
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:10,500
Locomotive brake...

1607
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:12,060
Is it this?

1608
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,620
I only have one...

1609
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:18,100
Engaged?

1610
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,820
I have more than one engine?

1611
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:21,320
Oh!

1612
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:24,140
What's this?

1613
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:29,500
Go up.

1614
01:05:33,290 --> 01:05:34,330
Pull it back.

1615
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:37,750
All right.

1616
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:38,750
I pulled it back.

1617
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:41,530
Don't worry.

1618
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:42,710
We know what we're doing, guys.

1619
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:44,810
Are we going forward?

1620
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:46,770
Are we...

1621
01:05:46,770 --> 01:05:47,270
Guys.

1622
01:05:47,370 --> 01:05:48,710
I think we needed the tutorial.

1623
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:49,970
Wait.

1624
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:50,770
What does this button do?

1625
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:54,710
Oh, it does nothing.

1626
01:05:54,870 --> 01:05:55,150
Okay.

1627
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:55,810
It says emergency.

1628
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:58,330
You had the locomotive.

1629
01:05:58,610 --> 01:05:59,170
Here we go.

1630
01:05:59,190 --> 01:05:59,870
We're going forward!

1631
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:00,450
Guys!

1632
01:06:04,550 --> 01:06:05,310
Oh my...

1633
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:06,330
I don't need squat.

1634
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:07,910
I don't need squat.

1635
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:13,840
Guys, I fucking knew it!

1636
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:16,180
I don't need train school!

1637
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:18,640
Anybody can be a conductor!

1638
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:20,980
There's like five buttons!

1639
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:21,900
Chat!

1640
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:23,600
Alright, see?

1641
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:23,960
Alright.

1642
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:35,400
Hey passengers, luckily, we were lucky enough that the herd of deers and geese made it through!

1643
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:39,120
So we can, you know, we can get started everybody!

1644
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:44,480
We can keep on going to your destination!

1645
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:47,460
We're not delayed, I'm pretty sure.

1646
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:48,340
Where are we?

1647
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:50,720
Alright, where is the stop?

1648
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:52,860
We have to stop at track 9.

1649
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:54,880
I think we're making good progress.

1650
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:55,720
That's our train!

1651
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:58,360
That's our train right there.

1652
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:00,220
We're making really good progress.

1653
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:02,100
We're not late, it just says stop at.

1654
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,200
It didn't say what time.

1655
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:05,320
It did not say what time.

1656
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,340
I should be there.

1657
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:08,220
Oh, so yeah!

1658
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,000
Guys.

1659
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:13,080
We're making really good progress, chat.

1660
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:20,760
I'm sorry to all the actual train enthusiasts that are watching me drive this train right now.

1661
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,680
Because I know it's making you feel...

1662
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:25,460
How are we stopping again?!

1663
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:31,280
Who keeps stopping our train?!

1664
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:35,300
Who is it?!

1665
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:40,460
Who keeps stopping?!

1666
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:41,540
Who is doing that?!

1667
01:07:45,410 --> 01:07:46,570
I don't understand!

1668
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:49,470
How am I hitting the brakes?!

1669
01:07:49,470 --> 01:07:50,870
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1670
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:51,130
Whoops.

1671
01:07:57,090 --> 01:07:58,630
It was me.

1672
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:00,930
I'm hitting the brakes.

1673
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:07,070
Guys.

1674
01:08:07,070 --> 01:08:08,670
It was me.

1675
01:08:08,850 --> 01:08:12,730
I was the one that was hitting the brakes.

1676
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:19,470
Oh no, I don't know how to start the train again.

1677
01:08:20,110 --> 01:08:23,430
I touched the lever again, guys.

1678
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:25,930
It was me all along.

1679
01:08:26,490 --> 01:08:30,090
I keep stopping the train, chat.

1680
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:33,490
Who would have thought?

1681
01:08:33,690 --> 01:08:36,070
It was me all along.

1682
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:42,970
Every time you leave the train, the train alone, he gets sad.

1683
01:08:43,330 --> 01:08:47,250
All the train enthusiasts in my chat yelling at me right now.

1684
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:48,350
Oh my god.

1685
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:50,550
I keep forgetting how to start back the train.

1686
01:08:50,670 --> 01:08:51,270
Guys.

1687
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:55,670
There should be a key that lets you start the train.

1688
01:08:56,170 --> 01:08:58,050
It just kick starts it.

1689
01:08:58,370 --> 01:09:00,110
There should be a key for that.

1690
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:03,070
Like a hotkey.

1691
01:09:03,090 --> 01:09:06,410
Where I just press it and all the train will go fast.

1692
01:09:08,530 --> 01:09:09,810
Logico, thank you for the super chat.

1693
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:10,150
Thank you.

1694
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:10,910
Thank you.

1695
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:13,070
Dell, thank you for the super chat.

1696
01:09:13,170 --> 01:09:13,390
Thank you.

1697
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:13,870
Thank you.

1698
01:09:13,870 --> 01:09:15,050
I can see the headlines now.

1699
01:09:15,210 --> 01:09:17,930
Tomato causes double decker train derailment in Baltimore.

1700
01:09:18,310 --> 01:09:19,590
Oh, there's another train!

1701
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:21,490
Say hi to the train sister!

1702
01:09:23,670 --> 01:09:24,710
Hello, train sister.

1703
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:29,630
How can he drive his train so fast and I can't?

1704
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:30,250
How can he drive his train so fast and I can't?

1705
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:33,310
What's the difference between his train and my train?

1706
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:41,890
I don't understand.

1707
01:09:42,730 --> 01:09:43,990
Woodman, thank you for the super chat.

1708
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:44,310
Thank you.

1709
01:09:44,350 --> 01:09:44,770
Thank you.

1710
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,330
I sent you an email about this game.

1711
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:48,650
I'm actually a locomotive engineer and would love to help you out.

1712
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:50,310
Alright, what do I do, Woodman?

1713
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:52,290
What do I do now?

1714
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:55,770
Why is my train always so clingy?

1715
01:09:57,530 --> 01:09:59,090
What buttons do I press?

1716
01:10:01,050 --> 01:10:04,370
Why is my train such a clingy little bitch?

1717
01:10:11,230 --> 01:10:12,530
Easy, don't break.

1718
01:10:12,610 --> 01:10:14,290
But I'm not going forward!

1719
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:16,190
Guys!

1720
01:10:16,570 --> 01:10:17,830
I'm not going!

1721
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:19,790
Maybe... oh, wait, wait.

1722
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:21,610
I need to unlock it.

1723
01:10:21,870 --> 01:10:22,970
Did I unlock it?

1724
01:10:25,170 --> 01:10:26,250
Am I going forward?

1725
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:29,670
Oh, I pressed the yellow again!

1726
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:31,130
I pressed the yellow button!

1727
01:10:31,410 --> 01:10:32,310
I did it!

1728
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:33,130
It's okay.

1729
01:10:33,290 --> 01:10:33,750
It's okay.

1730
01:10:33,890 --> 01:10:34,550
I don't need it.

1731
01:10:35,490 --> 01:10:36,010
It's okay.

1732
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:36,530
We did it.

1733
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:41,930
Guys, I did it.

1734
01:10:42,010 --> 01:10:43,710
I need to remember to not hit this button.

1735
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:44,650
Oh my god!

1736
01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:45,790
And there's light now!

1737
01:10:45,970 --> 01:10:48,530
I'm doing a good job so the game is giving me light!

1738
01:10:49,870 --> 01:10:51,750
Guys, I'm doing a good job!

1739
01:10:54,270 --> 01:10:54,710
Yay!

1740
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:56,010
Celebratory honk!

1741
01:10:56,010 --> 01:10:56,650
Honk, honk!

1742
01:10:58,170 --> 01:10:58,610
Honk!

1743
01:11:00,570 --> 01:11:03,090
No one needs a train, but I'm so lonely!

1744
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:05,790
It's just me and the train!

1745
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:09,910
I want to hang out with the dragoons in the passenger seats!

1746
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:12,770
They're playing like Uno right now!

1747
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:18,610
I need to press the button?

1748
01:11:18,730 --> 01:11:20,050
Why would I need to press the button?

1749
01:11:20,450 --> 01:11:22,270
Every time I press the button, I stop.

1750
01:11:22,450 --> 01:11:23,390
Oh, there's cars outside!

1751
01:11:24,430 --> 01:11:25,350
Hello, cars!

1752
01:11:25,690 --> 01:11:29,970
Hello, cars!

1753
01:11:29,970 --> 01:11:30,810
Where are the other trains?

1754
01:11:31,010 --> 01:11:33,330
Where are the other trains in front of me?

1755
01:11:38,110 --> 01:11:39,810
There's safety penalties?

1756
01:11:40,910 --> 01:11:42,390
There's no safety procedure!

1757
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:43,890
What if I own the train?

1758
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:46,550
If I own the railroad company?

1759
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:48,930
Because railroad companies are a monopoly.

1760
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:52,210
And it's my turn to drive the train?

1761
01:11:52,490 --> 01:11:54,550
I should have zero safety penalties.

1762
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:56,410
I bought the game!

1763
01:11:56,650 --> 01:11:58,290
So I own this railroad.

1764
01:11:58,850 --> 01:12:01,110
Mr. Brokenbottom, thank you for the super chat!

1765
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:02,250
Thank you, thank you!

1766
01:12:02,290 --> 01:12:05,450
This train reminds me of the train from the Sonic Murder Mystery Game.

1767
01:12:05,630 --> 01:12:06,930
Such clingy trains.

1768
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:08,710
Thank you Mr. Oh shit!

1769
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:11,270
It went yellow again!

1770
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:11,670
No!

1771
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:14,470
No, I got the safety penalty!

1772
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:15,690
Stop!

1773
01:12:18,310 --> 01:12:20,430
I went over the safety...

1774
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:31,380
I can't believe the safety police is here!

1775
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:37,880
Every time I go too fast, the safety police stop me!

1776
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:39,680
What a fucking loser!

1777
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:41,740
No fun!

1778
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:47,580
This train won't let me have fun!

1779
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:51,300
They keep pressing the yellow button on me!

1780
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:52,180
Every time!

1781
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,740
Every fucking time!

1782
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:03,020
And you hit control D and then control F.

1783
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:06,140
I can get rid of the safety procedures.

1784
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:07,240
That's good.

1785
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:08,700
We don't need safety here.

1786
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:13,280
We don't need safety...

1787
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:14,540
I can't believe it!

1788
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:19,260
They keep fucking getting me into the safety zone!

1789
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:25,880
Losers!

1790
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:31,560
Goddamn losers!

1791
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:33,480
Boom.

1792
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:34,580
There we go.

1793
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:36,800
I pressed all the buttons again.

1794
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:39,220
Let me drive my train!

1795
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,560
We don't need safety!

1796
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:45,960
What is this?

1797
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:47,160
Signal speed.

1798
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:48,340
Track speed.

1799
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:51,120
I can't believe I can't do...

1800
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:52,760
I can't do like...

1801
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:55,220
Full speed ahead.

1802
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,340
That's bullshit.

1803
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:00,560
Bro, I'm not even close to my stop.

1804
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,400
Every time!

1805
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:07,060
Every fucking time!

1806
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,040
Okay.

1807
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,200
Release the brakes!

1808
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:13,940
Release!

1809
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:16,160
Go!

1810
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:17,800
Go!

1811
01:14:23,010 --> 01:14:23,730
Alright.

1812
01:14:24,910 --> 01:14:25,910
Let's see.

1813
01:14:27,770 --> 01:14:29,110
Can't believe it!

1814
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:30,650
Fine!

1815
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:32,430
We won't go all the way.

1816
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:33,430
We'll do 55.

1817
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:34,970
Are you happy, train?

1818
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:37,090
I even let you do 55!

1819
01:14:37,090 --> 01:14:37,470
55!

1820
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:38,670
You know what?

1821
01:14:38,670 --> 01:14:39,810
You don't deserve win wipers!

1822
01:14:40,970 --> 01:14:42,190
You don't deserve it!

1823
01:14:43,570 --> 01:14:45,170
Yellow then breaks down.

1824
01:14:45,550 --> 01:14:46,150
Yellow.

1825
01:14:46,370 --> 01:14:47,410
Breaks down.

1826
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:49,350
Alright.

1827
01:14:50,150 --> 01:14:50,750
Go!

1828
01:14:52,210 --> 01:14:53,430
Am I going forward?

1829
01:14:55,310 --> 01:14:56,690
Am I going forward?

1830
01:14:58,510 --> 01:14:59,330
Am I...

1831
01:14:59,330 --> 01:15:01,150
Wait, brakes are still on?

1832
01:15:01,350 --> 01:15:01,630
How?

1833
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:05,150
Is this releasing it?

1834
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:06,270
Local brake.

1835
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:07,670
Train brake.

1836
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:09,970
Train brake.

1837
01:15:10,270 --> 01:15:10,910
Alright.

1838
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:11,490
Zero.

1839
01:15:13,490 --> 01:15:14,130
Alright.

1840
01:15:17,690 --> 01:15:18,330
Go!

1841
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:20,550
Go!

1842
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:21,750
Go!

1843
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:22,090
Oh, no.

1844
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:23,630
Come on!

1845
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:24,370
I turned it off!

1846
01:15:25,170 --> 01:15:28,310
Oh, I have to stop accelerating before I start?

1847
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:28,890
Whoops.

1848
01:15:29,070 --> 01:15:29,350
Okay.

1849
01:15:30,170 --> 01:15:31,310
Maybe that's it.

1850
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:34,610
Is that it?

1851
01:15:35,910 --> 01:15:36,910
Pull both red.

1852
01:15:37,150 --> 01:15:38,510
I think I pulled the red already.

1853
01:15:38,630 --> 01:15:39,590
Yeah, the red's already down.

1854
01:15:42,690 --> 01:15:43,170
Ugh.

1855
01:15:44,130 --> 01:15:45,310
All the way down.

1856
01:15:45,410 --> 01:15:45,690
Okay.

1857
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:48,510
All the way down.

1858
01:15:49,590 --> 01:15:50,570
Are we doing it?

1859
01:15:50,650 --> 01:15:51,130
Guys!

1860
01:15:51,210 --> 01:15:51,690
You...

1861
01:15:51,690 --> 01:15:54,870
You decide to ride on the train instead of taking a car.

1862
01:15:55,310 --> 01:15:56,190
That's on you!

1863
01:16:00,450 --> 01:16:02,110
You know what you're getting!

1864
01:16:02,290 --> 01:16:02,950
Oh, my God!

1865
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:04,690
He decided to ride a train.

1866
01:16:09,350 --> 01:16:10,610
That's on you!

1867
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:13,530
Oh, my God.

1868
01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:15,190
The train police stopped me.

1869
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:18,030
I can't believe...

1870
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:20,250
The train police stopped me!

1871
01:16:21,630 --> 01:16:23,290
Fucking train police.

1872
01:16:23,670 --> 01:16:24,990
Don't get me laid to work.

1873
01:16:25,190 --> 01:16:27,410
You know who's driving this train!

1874
01:16:29,070 --> 01:16:33,230
You could've taken a plane or a car, and then, all of a sudden, this train has stopped A car!

1875
01:16:33,290 --> 01:16:34,570
Or a metro!

1876
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:37,350
You could take any other train.

1877
01:16:37,490 --> 01:16:39,130
It's not new for riding on my train.

1878
01:16:39,690 --> 01:16:41,370
You know it was my first day.

1879
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:43,170
Alright, let's see.

1880
01:16:43,610 --> 01:16:49,190
I'm trying to... the fucking fun police stopped my train like four times, okay?

1881
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:51,070
And I still don't know how to fix this.

1882
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:59,870
Okay, everything is off.

1883
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:02,110
I pressed the yellow button.

1884
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:05,170
The yellow button is pressed.

1885
01:17:05,850 --> 01:17:06,850
Is this off?

1886
01:17:07,330 --> 01:17:08,470
Yeah, this is off.

1887
01:17:08,770 --> 01:17:09,390
Alright.

1888
01:17:09,790 --> 01:17:11,070
And then...

1889
01:17:12,790 --> 01:17:13,670
There you go.

1890
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:16,030
Can I go forward now?

1891
01:17:18,330 --> 01:17:19,570
This is not fair!

1892
01:17:23,150 --> 01:17:23,510
Forward!

1893
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:29,830
Stupid rules and regulations.

1894
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:33,810
Wait, is that another train behind me?

1895
01:17:36,230 --> 01:17:36,590
No.

1896
01:17:36,590 --> 01:17:38,470
Okay, I thought there was another train behind me.

1897
01:17:38,490 --> 01:17:39,210
That would have been awkward.

1898
01:17:39,570 --> 01:17:40,170
No, there's me.

1899
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:41,010
There's me.

1900
01:17:41,050 --> 01:17:41,750
Do you guys see me?

1901
01:17:42,590 --> 01:17:43,570
There's me over there.

1902
01:17:49,650 --> 01:17:51,290
I keep turning the brakes on.

1903
01:17:51,390 --> 01:17:52,270
Is this the brakes?

1904
01:17:56,950 --> 01:18:01,850
Guys, I should have... Okay, after I head to the destination, I'm gonna go look at the tutorial.

1905
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:04,570
I'm gonna look at the tutorial.

1906
01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:07,790
I swear.

1907
01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:09,530
I'll look at the tutorial.

1908
01:18:09,870 --> 01:18:12,070
I just wanna get to my destination.

1909
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:19,830
Guys, why won't they let me go?

1910
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:20,950
Hahaha.

1911
01:18:21,790 --> 01:18:22,350
Hahaha.

1912
01:18:24,610 --> 01:18:30,770
I don't understand why the train would do this.

1913
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:31,610
Hahaha.

1914
01:18:34,230 --> 01:18:35,710
Alright, here we go.

1915
01:18:36,710 --> 01:18:37,590
Um...

1916
01:18:40,170 --> 01:18:41,050
Okay.

1917
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:42,170
Let's see.

1918
01:18:44,730 --> 01:18:45,610
Alright.

1919
01:18:45,610 --> 01:18:47,390
Red handle up.

1920
01:18:47,730 --> 01:18:48,610
Alright.

1921
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:50,110
Yellow button.

1922
01:18:51,230 --> 01:18:52,750
Throttle off.

1923
01:18:52,890 --> 01:18:54,030
What's throttle?

1924
01:18:54,030 --> 01:18:54,330
Throttle.

1925
01:18:55,710 --> 01:18:57,010
Is this throttle?

1926
01:18:57,290 --> 01:18:58,490
Power controller.

1927
01:19:00,170 --> 01:19:00,930
Acknowledge.

1928
01:19:03,210 --> 01:19:03,970
Boom.

1929
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:06,290
Boom.

1930
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:06,930
Boom.

1931
01:19:09,090 --> 01:19:09,930
That's it.

1932
01:19:10,010 --> 01:19:11,470
Nobody's making it to their destination.

1933
01:19:12,030 --> 01:19:12,590
Nope.

1934
01:19:12,810 --> 01:19:13,450
Hahaha.

1935
01:19:16,730 --> 01:19:17,550
That's it.

1936
01:19:18,270 --> 01:19:20,570
Nobody's gonna arrive to their destination.

1937
01:19:20,690 --> 01:19:22,830
We're going back to train school.

1938
01:19:22,830 --> 01:19:24,170
We're going...

1939
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:24,670
Hahaha.

1940
01:19:25,950 --> 01:19:26,510
Hahaha.

1941
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:28,670
That's looking it.

1942
01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:32,610
You guys all say, I'm fucking taking a taxi and going back to train school.

1943
01:19:32,890 --> 01:19:34,750
You guys can all call an Uber.

1944
01:19:34,930 --> 01:19:36,790
I need to figure this out.

1945
01:19:37,150 --> 01:19:37,610
Alright.

1946
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:38,370
Driving.

1947
01:19:39,130 --> 01:19:39,690
Okay.

1948
01:19:39,770 --> 01:19:40,430
Let's see.

1949
01:19:40,530 --> 01:19:42,270
Which one was the train I was trying?

1950
01:19:42,530 --> 01:19:43,090
Alright.

1951
01:19:43,490 --> 01:19:44,970
Switching cabs.

1952
01:19:45,570 --> 01:19:46,130
Stop.

1953
01:19:46,330 --> 01:19:46,610
Okay.

1954
01:19:46,670 --> 01:19:47,650
Switching junction.

1955
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:49,150
Loading passengers?

1956
01:19:49,710 --> 01:19:50,910
Should it just be this?

1957
01:19:51,290 --> 01:19:51,850
Alright.

1958
01:19:53,250 --> 01:19:53,850
Alright.

1959
01:19:53,850 --> 01:19:54,670
Alright, guys.

1960
01:19:55,050 --> 01:19:55,410
Okay.

1961
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:56,490
Welcome to the rail.

1962
01:19:56,610 --> 01:19:59,210
Complete each section after closing these messages.

1963
01:19:59,570 --> 01:20:01,810
And let's learn about switching junctions.

1964
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:04,910
Modern busy railroads are controlled by...

1965
01:20:04,910 --> 01:20:07,630
Remotely by a signaling center dispatcher.

1966
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:10,210
In freight yards, many small and frequent...

1967
01:20:10,210 --> 01:20:11,230
Uh...

1968
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:12,670
Are required.

1969
01:20:12,810 --> 01:20:15,230
Making automatic control impractical in yards.

1970
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:16,910
Those switches are manual?

1971
01:20:17,950 --> 01:20:21,830
The difference between the two types of switches can be identified by their...

1972
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:22,270
Equipment.

1973
01:20:22,270 --> 01:20:25,550
A manual switch has a lever to turn it one way or the other.

1974
01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:28,690
An automatic switch has a small box containing...

1975
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:29,770
Oh my god!

1976
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:35,790
Manual junctions can be operated by clicking the lever or pressing G.

1977
01:20:36,050 --> 01:20:38,390
They can also be changed on the action...

1978
01:20:38,390 --> 01:20:39,750
What the fuck?

1979
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:43,130
Up ahead, the pass switch is to the left.

1980
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:47,410
Using the free camera, fly over and click on the lever?

1981
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:51,550
I have to fucking get off my train and click on the lever?

1982
01:20:52,630 --> 01:20:53,670
What do you...

1983
01:20:53,670 --> 01:20:56,230
What do you mean?

1984
01:21:00,790 --> 01:21:04,050
What do you mean I have to click on the lever?

1985
01:21:06,170 --> 01:21:07,310
That's fucked up!

1986
01:21:07,990 --> 01:21:09,290
Wait, we should go forward?

1987
01:21:11,010 --> 01:21:11,490
Okay.

1988
01:21:12,210 --> 01:21:14,210
It's fine, we're going forward right now, right?

1989
01:21:15,410 --> 01:21:16,110
It's fine.

1990
01:21:16,790 --> 01:21:18,250
Oh, I have a co-pilot!

1991
01:21:19,810 --> 01:21:21,530
Guys, it's okay, I have a co-pilot.

1992
01:21:21,530 --> 01:21:22,110
Co-pilot!

1993
01:21:22,490 --> 01:21:23,870
That's gonna help me!

1994
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:27,410
It's gonna help me, guys!

1995
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:28,030
It's okay!

1996
01:21:29,070 --> 01:21:30,210
Wait, where's the lever?

1997
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:34,090
Where's the lever?

1998
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:36,470
Oh, here!

1999
01:21:37,210 --> 01:21:38,330
Oh god, guys!

2000
01:21:38,710 --> 01:21:39,890
I missed the lever.

2001
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:42,890
Guys, it's okay, I pressed it now!

2002
01:21:45,290 --> 01:21:46,510
I did it!

2003
01:21:52,190 --> 01:21:53,350
Guys, it worked, guys.

2004
01:21:57,250 --> 01:21:58,810
Guys, I think I did it.

2005
01:21:58,850 --> 01:22:02,730
I reached it!

2006
01:22:02,810 --> 01:22:04,310
It said I reached it!

2007
01:22:05,190 --> 01:22:08,490
Guys, it said I reached it, so I assume I did it correctly.

2008
01:22:08,870 --> 01:22:11,130
Oh, I can like learn how to load an unknown.

2009
01:22:12,350 --> 01:22:16,450
Alright, guys, we reached our de- Okay, this is when we pretend we reached our destination.

2010
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:17,650
Hello, everybody!

2011
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:19,190
We reached our destination!

2012
01:22:21,430 --> 01:22:22,390
Welcome back!

2013
01:22:22,430 --> 01:22:23,910
We learned how to pick up passengers!

2014
01:22:24,330 --> 01:22:26,310
Oh yeah, I'm familiar on how to stop.

2015
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:28,810
We're approaching the station.

2016
01:22:29,030 --> 01:22:30,430
Bring the train to stop alongside.

2017
01:22:31,350 --> 01:22:31,830
Okay.

2018
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:35,990
There we go.

2019
01:22:36,190 --> 01:22:37,110
Are we slowing down?

2020
01:22:38,630 --> 01:22:39,770
Wait, are we there yet?

2021
01:22:40,050 --> 01:22:41,630
Oh shit, okay, guys, sorry.

2022
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:43,390
We're gonna have to keep going.

2023
01:22:43,870 --> 01:22:47,150
Whoops, we sort of stopped a little bit.

2024
01:22:47,390 --> 01:22:47,830
Whoops, we sort of stopped a little bit.

2025
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:48,470
Sorry, guys.

2026
01:22:48,470 --> 01:22:51,310
The train is experiencing a small delay.

2027
01:22:55,730 --> 01:22:58,910
Sorry, I stopped a little bit too early.

2028
01:23:03,290 --> 01:23:04,710
Don't worry, we're going back!

2029
01:23:04,910 --> 01:23:05,630
See, there's me!

2030
01:23:07,610 --> 01:23:08,810
We're starting again!

2031
01:23:09,390 --> 01:23:10,430
Don't worry, guys.

2032
01:23:10,570 --> 01:23:12,550
I know how to do this for real.

2033
01:23:15,510 --> 01:23:16,310
It's okay.

2034
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:20,790
Sorry, I didn't realize where the train stop was.

2035
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:22,530
Oh my god, there's people there!

2036
01:23:22,710 --> 01:23:24,690
There's people that believes in the Doki train!

2037
01:23:25,110 --> 01:23:26,130
They heard...

2038
01:23:26,870 --> 01:23:28,970
They heard I was gonna be here!

2039
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:30,970
Wait, stop.

2040
01:23:31,530 --> 01:23:32,170
Wait, stop.

2041
01:23:32,530 --> 01:23:34,410
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2042
01:23:34,530 --> 01:23:35,670
Oh, I'm still in, I'm still in.

2043
01:23:35,810 --> 01:23:37,090
Sorry, this is a little...

2044
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:37,770
I'm still in, guys.

2045
01:23:38,190 --> 01:23:38,650
See?

2046
01:23:39,090 --> 01:23:39,870
They heard!

2047
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:43,230
Allow passengers on board.

2048
01:23:44,490 --> 01:23:46,290
Switch to external view and click on the button.

2049
01:23:46,290 --> 01:23:48,590
Click on the path form or press T.

2050
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:51,210
Oh, wait, I was supposed to...

2051
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:52,330
Oh!

2052
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:54,970
I was definitely not boarding people.

2053
01:23:57,150 --> 01:23:58,070
Oh my...

2054
01:23:58,070 --> 01:23:58,770
Guys...

2055
01:23:59,290 --> 01:24:04,350
I was definitely not letting people in my train in the beginning, guys.

2056
01:24:04,450 --> 01:24:05,170
I just realized.

2057
01:24:07,010 --> 01:24:10,930
The people in my train from before were just trapped in there.

2058
01:24:16,290 --> 01:24:23,450
The people that were in the other train was definitely just trapped in there from a previous ride.

2059
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:27,890
I definitely took them somewhere that they were not supposed to be.

2060
01:24:29,950 --> 01:24:30,950
Alright, we...

2061
01:24:30,950 --> 01:24:32,330
We learned!

2062
01:24:33,630 --> 01:24:35,430
Guys, we're learning!

2063
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:37,050
We're learning!

2064
01:24:38,410 --> 01:24:39,090
Uh...

2065
01:24:40,090 --> 01:24:40,770
Objectives...

2066
01:24:40,770 --> 01:24:42,870
Okay, we don't need to know these.

2067
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:45,690
So, we don't have water, so controls.

2068
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:46,610
Alright!

2069
01:24:49,670 --> 01:24:50,550
Primary control...

2070
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:51,110
What?

2071
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:52,330
Electric, right?

2072
01:24:52,590 --> 01:24:53,030
No.

2073
01:24:53,470 --> 01:24:56,310
What were some of the actual good trains?

2074
01:24:56,750 --> 01:24:57,190
Okay.

2075
01:24:57,770 --> 01:24:59,090
Has to be like...

2076
01:24:59,090 --> 01:24:59,730
This one.

2077
01:24:59,850 --> 01:25:00,190
This one.

2078
01:25:00,830 --> 01:25:01,270
Alright.

2079
01:25:02,990 --> 01:25:03,830
Alright, here we go.

2080
01:25:04,490 --> 01:25:06,050
Alright, we're gonna learn the controls, guys!

2081
01:25:06,470 --> 01:25:07,990
Back to train school we go!

2082
01:25:10,490 --> 01:25:12,090
This is a cab of a class.

2083
01:25:12,210 --> 01:25:14,350
The camera will change view if each control is set correctly.

2084
01:25:14,910 --> 01:25:15,210
Okay.

2085
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:18,230
You need the direction power.

2086
01:25:18,890 --> 01:25:20,850
Direction is controlled by the reverser.

2087
01:25:20,910 --> 01:25:22,290
Push this all the way forward.

2088
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:28,970
This train has combined power and brake levers.

2089
01:25:29,170 --> 01:25:31,130
Sat in the middle, power is neutral.

2090
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:33,410
To start, pull the lever 2 or 2 to 3.

2091
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:36,110
3.

2092
01:25:37,250 --> 01:25:38,010
That's 57.

2093
01:25:38,650 --> 01:25:40,550
Oh, I should not put it on 100 then.

2094
01:25:41,690 --> 01:25:42,170
Yay!

2095
01:25:43,230 --> 01:25:44,410
Oh my god, there's safety!

2096
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:46,830
There's a safety thing behind me.

2097
01:25:54,330 --> 01:25:55,270
Is that safe?

2098
01:25:55,370 --> 01:25:56,250
Oh, it's not safe!

2099
01:25:56,470 --> 01:25:57,210
Oh, shit.

2100
01:25:57,930 --> 01:25:58,370
Yay!

2101
01:26:03,710 --> 01:26:04,710
Put it all the way.

2102
01:26:05,370 --> 01:26:06,290
Max it up!

2103
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:11,550
I don't know what that yellow button did, but I pressed it.

2104
01:26:11,910 --> 01:26:13,690
I still don't know what it does.

2105
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:16,830
I think I'm doing a pretty good job.

2106
01:26:19,330 --> 01:26:20,690
It says full power.

2107
01:26:21,550 --> 01:26:24,410
Hey, it told me to put full power, guys.

2108
01:26:26,190 --> 01:26:30,150
The main speed, we don't need any power because push the lever to off.

2109
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:33,470
Every system may have a low setting may be required.

2110
01:26:34,570 --> 01:26:35,170
Off?

2111
01:26:35,650 --> 01:26:36,670
That's so fun.

2112
01:26:37,190 --> 01:26:38,930
How would my dragones have fun?

2113
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:46,780
How would they have fun if the power is off?

2114
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,540
They'll think it's boring.

2115
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:53,900
Oh my gosh, they won't let me look at the passenger.

2116
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:55,060
They won't even let me...

2117
01:26:55,060 --> 01:26:55,980
I want to stop.

2118
01:26:56,060 --> 01:26:58,900
Push the lever slowly forward until the camera resets.

2119
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,500
Close this message box.

2120
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:00,940
What?

2121
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:04,840
Slowly forward until it resets.

2122
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:08,360
Oh, all the way up?

2123
01:27:09,660 --> 01:27:10,560
Oh, okay.

2124
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:15,440
I can't interact with the passengers.

2125
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:16,860
It won't let me.

2126
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:19,520
It's like they knew what I did in 19...

2127
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:19,980
1975.

2128
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:23,260
Okay.

2129
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:23,960
Alright.

2130
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:26,020
Nice.

2131
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:26,480
Alright.

2132
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:28,060
Wait, that's so easy.

2133
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:29,920
Wait.

2134
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,540
All of this is so easy.

2135
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,000
So like...

2136
01:27:34,350 --> 01:27:35,240
Did I learn enough?

2137
01:27:35,380 --> 01:27:36,540
What else do I have to learn?

2138
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:41,140
What else do I have to learn, chat?

2139
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:49,920
I don't understand.

2140
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:51,760
Try the other train?

2141
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:53,360
But I learned everything.

2142
01:27:56,380 --> 01:27:58,280
I learned everything though.

2143
01:27:58,400 --> 01:27:59,960
What else do I need to learn?

2144
01:28:09,090 --> 01:28:09,910
Driving again?

2145
01:28:10,410 --> 01:28:11,530
Wait, where's driving?

2146
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:12,270
Driving.

2147
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:14,790
What do you mean?

2148
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:18,090
It's switching junctions and switching cabs.

2149
01:28:18,090 --> 01:28:19,370
We don't need to know that.

2150
01:28:22,730 --> 01:28:24,690
We already know how to...

2151
01:28:24,690 --> 01:28:25,710
Okay, I think we're fine.

2152
01:28:26,330 --> 01:28:26,850
Alright.

2153
01:28:26,930 --> 01:28:29,090
As long as there's no safety, we're fine.

2154
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:30,650
Okay, quick drive.

2155
01:28:31,490 --> 01:28:32,130
Okay.

2156
01:28:32,650 --> 01:28:32,970
Custom.

2157
01:28:33,830 --> 01:28:34,750
I can...

2158
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:36,570
Can I create my own train?

2159
01:28:39,490 --> 01:28:41,590
Can I create my own train?

2160
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:46,070
Oh my god.

2161
01:28:46,130 --> 01:28:47,990
I can create my own train.

2162
01:28:49,150 --> 01:28:52,250
Bro, this is where all the fucking nerds go.

2163
01:28:53,410 --> 01:28:54,530
I just do that?

2164
01:28:55,970 --> 01:28:56,610
Alright.

2165
01:28:56,750 --> 01:28:58,030
No engine found.

2166
01:28:58,450 --> 01:28:59,910
Where the fuck is an engine?

2167
01:29:00,070 --> 01:29:00,630
I don't know.

2168
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:03,570
There.

2169
01:29:03,670 --> 01:29:03,990
There.

2170
01:29:03,990 --> 01:29:04,930
Add to front.

2171
01:29:05,130 --> 01:29:06,330
It's incompatible?

2172
01:29:06,590 --> 01:29:07,550
It's just...

2173
01:29:07,550 --> 01:29:08,510
No engine.

2174
01:29:08,690 --> 01:29:09,570
Oh my god.

2175
01:29:09,870 --> 01:29:10,170
Okay.

2176
01:29:10,210 --> 01:29:10,850
Oh, it's wet.

2177
01:29:11,070 --> 01:29:12,130
Oh, wagon.

2178
01:29:13,010 --> 01:29:13,610
Diesel.

2179
01:29:14,190 --> 01:29:14,790
Electric.

2180
01:29:14,890 --> 01:29:15,350
Okay.

2181
01:29:15,890 --> 01:29:17,350
Maybe we can just add this.

2182
01:29:18,350 --> 01:29:19,230
There you go.

2183
01:29:20,190 --> 01:29:20,790
Name.

2184
01:29:23,210 --> 01:29:23,810
Dragoons.

2185
01:29:24,490 --> 01:29:25,090
Save.

2186
01:29:25,850 --> 01:29:26,450
Alright.

2187
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:28,170
Where did my dragoon car go?

2188
01:29:29,150 --> 01:29:29,770
I don't know.

2189
01:29:30,010 --> 01:29:30,610
I don't know.

2190
01:29:30,610 --> 01:29:32,190
Where is it?

2191
01:29:32,210 --> 01:29:33,810
I created a dragoon car.

2192
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:37,190
I can't believe it.

2193
01:29:37,210 --> 01:29:37,810
Oh, there it is.

2194
01:29:38,110 --> 01:29:38,670
Nice.

2195
01:29:39,810 --> 01:29:40,370
Nice.

2196
01:29:40,870 --> 01:29:41,430
Alright.

2197
01:29:43,830 --> 01:29:44,610
Let's start.

2198
01:29:44,890 --> 01:29:45,810
No rain.

2199
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:47,010
That shit sucked.

2200
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:51,790
That shit fucking sucked.

2201
01:29:51,850 --> 01:29:51,990
Wait.

2202
01:29:52,070 --> 01:29:52,690
Free roam.

2203
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:57,110
If I do free roam, does that mean like...

2204
01:29:57,110 --> 01:29:58,190
Wait.

2205
01:29:58,190 --> 01:29:59,490
Can I actually...

2206
01:29:59,490 --> 01:30:00,430
No, I can't.

2207
01:30:00,430 --> 01:30:00,590
Oh, I can't.

2208
01:30:00,590 --> 01:30:02,030
Oh, I don't have...

2209
01:30:03,570 --> 01:30:05,130
I don't have the...

2210
01:30:07,070 --> 01:30:08,050
It's only the en...

2211
01:30:08,050 --> 01:30:09,330
The engine is all...

2212
01:30:09,330 --> 01:30:10,110
Oh, you're right.

2213
01:30:10,190 --> 01:30:10,490
You're right.

2214
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:11,290
We need like...

2215
01:30:11,290 --> 01:30:12,470
We need people in it.

2216
01:30:12,730 --> 01:30:13,250
Alright.

2217
01:30:13,370 --> 01:30:15,690
How do we add people into our train?

2218
01:30:16,290 --> 01:30:16,810
Okay.

2219
01:30:16,850 --> 01:30:17,530
Is that the wagon?

2220
01:30:19,710 --> 01:30:21,530
I want to add people to our train.

2221
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:24,530
I need you guys to sit in my train.

2222
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:24,970
Okay.

2223
01:30:25,030 --> 01:30:25,410
Add...

2224
01:30:25,410 --> 01:30:25,730
Okay.

2225
01:30:25,770 --> 01:30:25,930
No.

2226
01:30:26,470 --> 01:30:27,310
Add back.

2227
01:30:27,850 --> 01:30:28,370
Delete.

2228
01:30:28,710 --> 01:30:30,090
It's incompatible?

2229
01:30:30,590 --> 01:30:30,870
How?

2230
01:30:36,870 --> 01:30:39,230
I want people on my train.

2231
01:30:43,330 --> 01:30:43,890
Wait.

2232
01:30:44,010 --> 01:30:45,050
That must be it.

2233
01:30:45,990 --> 01:30:46,550
No?

2234
01:30:48,010 --> 01:30:50,230
How is it incompatible?

2235
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:52,310
Okay.

2236
01:30:54,510 --> 01:30:55,070
Guys.

2237
01:30:55,570 --> 01:30:56,590
Guys, I might...

2238
01:30:56,590 --> 01:30:59,670
Guys, I don't know if you guys noticed this, but I might not be...

2239
01:30:59,670 --> 01:31:02,030
I might not be a train expert.

2240
01:31:03,950 --> 01:31:05,690
Guys, is it noticeable?

2241
01:31:09,870 --> 01:31:13,410
Guys, is it noticeable that I don't know what I'm doing?

2242
01:31:17,970 --> 01:31:19,910
Can you tell, guys?

2243
01:31:22,090 --> 01:31:23,630
Can you guys tell?

2244
01:31:24,650 --> 01:31:25,470
Oh, okay.

2245
01:31:25,630 --> 01:31:26,430
Add to the front.

2246
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:27,090
Oh, there we go!

2247
01:31:28,550 --> 01:31:31,570
What if I want to add a different part of this car?

2248
01:31:32,850 --> 01:31:33,490
Okay, insert.

2249
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:36,310
Oh, alright, there we go.

2250
01:31:36,430 --> 01:31:37,010
There we go.

2251
01:31:37,070 --> 01:31:37,650
This is it.

2252
01:31:37,690 --> 01:31:38,150
We got it.

2253
01:31:38,330 --> 01:31:38,650
Okay.

2254
01:31:39,570 --> 01:31:39,890
Next.

2255
01:31:40,710 --> 01:31:42,630
This is the better Dragoons.

2256
01:31:44,110 --> 01:31:44,930
Alright, here we go.

2257
01:31:44,930 --> 01:31:45,350
We did it!

2258
01:31:46,270 --> 01:31:48,150
We have a new Dragoon car!

2259
01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:51,110
Alright, and then...

2260
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:52,770
Alright.

2261
01:31:53,730 --> 01:31:56,210
Alright, we have like... passengers.

2262
01:31:56,510 --> 01:31:57,030
For passengers.

2263
01:31:57,970 --> 01:31:59,530
No, I want like...

2264
01:31:59,930 --> 01:32:00,390
You're right!

2265
01:32:00,510 --> 01:32:01,970
I should add more carts.

2266
01:32:03,070 --> 01:32:03,930
Oh my god.

2267
01:32:04,210 --> 01:32:05,210
You're right, guys.

2268
01:32:05,490 --> 01:32:06,550
Wait, you're so right.

2269
01:32:06,810 --> 01:32:07,790
Guys, we're going back.

2270
01:32:08,110 --> 01:32:09,050
We're going back.

2271
01:32:09,090 --> 01:32:10,530
We're adding more carts into this.

2272
01:32:10,790 --> 01:32:11,450
You're right.

2273
01:32:11,530 --> 01:32:13,790
Whoever gave me that idea, you're a genius.

2274
01:32:14,470 --> 01:32:16,710
More people should be on my train.

2275
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:18,130
Alright, let's see.

2276
01:32:18,490 --> 01:32:20,230
Cabin, passenger car.

2277
01:32:20,430 --> 01:32:20,890
Insert.

2278
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:22,910
Oh, it doesn't work.

2279
01:32:23,030 --> 01:32:23,970
Oh, it has to be an electric.

2280
01:32:24,170 --> 01:32:24,530
Okay.

2281
01:32:25,330 --> 01:32:26,050
Motor car.

2282
01:32:26,290 --> 01:32:26,870
Is that right?

2283
01:32:27,330 --> 01:32:28,390
Add to the back.

2284
01:32:28,470 --> 01:32:28,610
Ooh.

2285
01:32:28,870 --> 01:32:29,930
And then we'll have...

2286
01:32:29,930 --> 01:32:30,890
What's this?

2287
01:32:31,210 --> 01:32:33,150
We need more passenger seatings.

2288
01:32:33,710 --> 01:32:34,110
Okay.

2289
01:32:34,470 --> 01:32:35,470
Add to the back.

2290
01:32:35,510 --> 01:32:35,710
No!

2291
01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:37,310
Wrong one!

2292
01:32:39,610 --> 01:32:40,870
Add to the back.

2293
01:32:41,730 --> 01:32:42,570
How about this?

2294
01:32:44,470 --> 01:32:46,870
Is there like... cat... or is there a way...

2295
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:47,790
Oh, okay.

2296
01:32:47,850 --> 01:32:49,810
No, that's just the regular stuff.

2297
01:32:49,810 --> 01:32:51,370
Alright, let's just keep adding.

2298
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:52,710
How many can I add?

2299
01:32:57,140 --> 01:32:57,700
Alright.

2300
01:32:57,800 --> 01:32:58,920
We can keep going.

2301
01:32:59,620 --> 01:33:01,460
Can I make a really long car?

2302
01:33:09,940 --> 01:33:12,640
Can I just make it super long?

2303
01:33:12,980 --> 01:33:14,340
I think I can.

2304
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:16,100
Add to the back.

2305
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:18,240
Alright, nice.

2306
01:33:18,420 --> 01:33:19,420
There's no problems.

2307
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:21,120
Oh my god.

2308
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:21,400
Okay.

2309
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:22,660
I'll keep adding more.

2310
01:33:22,660 --> 01:33:25,020
I mean, there's no problems with it.

2311
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:26,300
Alright, nice.

2312
01:33:27,020 --> 01:33:30,000
For all you 700,000 dragoons!

2313
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:30,800
Of course!

2314
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:32,500
Nice.

2315
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:33,520
Alright, here we go.

2316
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:35,480
I think we're good now.

2317
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:38,400
I think we can do this.

2318
01:33:40,980 --> 01:33:42,940
How many wag... I don't even know.

2319
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,060
I just kept pressing buttons.

2320
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:46,860
That's been my entire gameplay.

2321
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:48,380
I just keep pressing...

2322
01:33:48,380 --> 01:33:49,360
Oh, it's still going.

2323
01:33:49,540 --> 01:33:50,020
Hahaha!

2324
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:51,800
Hahaha!

2325
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:00,800
Guys, it's too long.

2326
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:09,620
Guys, I think... I think it's too long.

2327
01:34:10,940 --> 01:34:12,500
Okay, okay.

2328
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:15,420
We gotta... We gotta fix the train.

2329
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:16,560
Okay.

2330
01:34:17,340 --> 01:34:18,700
No fun!

2331
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:20,880
Guys.

2332
01:34:21,140 --> 01:34:21,920
Okay.

2333
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:22,180
Okay.

2334
01:34:22,180 --> 01:34:23,220
Let's start...

2335
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:24,440
Let's start deleting.

2336
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:26,680
Guys, what's the...

2337
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:30,100
What's the maximum amount that I can add?

2338
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:31,120
Alright.

2339
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:33,520
Okay, maybe that's better?

2340
01:34:33,620 --> 01:34:34,560
Is this better now?

2341
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:35,480
Train gods!

2342
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:37,580
Is this better now?

2343
01:34:37,940 --> 01:34:40,340
It spawned off the tracks.

2344
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:41,360
Alright.

2345
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:43,280
Now!

2346
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:46,060
Now!

2347
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:47,900
It should work!

2348
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:48,780
Yay!

2349
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:51,020
Alright.

2350
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:52,340
Here we go.

2351
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:53,820
Train gods.

2352
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:55,700
Is this better now?

2353
01:34:58,060 --> 01:34:59,660
I can't believe it!

2354
01:35:00,420 --> 01:35:00,960
Dragoons!

2355
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:03,100
You gotta stop derailing the train!

2356
01:35:03,540 --> 01:35:04,080
Hahaha!

2357
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:07,180
I don't think it's my fault.

2358
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:08,080
I think the dra...

2359
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:11,380
It was just too many Dragoons on the train that it got derailed.

2360
01:35:11,620 --> 01:35:12,800
I think that's it.

2361
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:13,540
There's no way.

2362
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:14,320
Hahaha!

2363
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:15,620
There's no way.

2364
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:16,440
Bruh!

2365
01:35:16,540 --> 01:35:18,680
How can it be like derailing?

2366
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:20,680
It's like...

2367
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:21,000
It's like...

2368
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:21,460
Four!

2369
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:22,900
Okay, there we go.

2370
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:26,060
One, two, three, four.

2371
01:35:26,460 --> 01:35:26,940
Alright.

2372
01:35:27,180 --> 01:35:28,200
Four passengers!

2373
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:29,600
That should be enough!

2374
01:35:30,620 --> 01:35:31,620
Alright, there we go.

2375
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:36,600
Okay, now we can go on the train.

2376
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:40,140
The long goon is too long.

2377
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:41,180
There we go.

2378
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:45,640
I like how it won't even let me see the train anymore.

2379
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:48,380
I'm just looking at the top of the roof.

2380
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:51,440
I can't believe it!

2381
01:35:51,980 --> 01:35:52,740
Why?!

2382
01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:55,700
Why do I keep derailing?

2383
01:35:57,280 --> 01:36:00,780
There's been trains that were that long?!

2384
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:04,260
It's not even that long anymore!

2385
01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:07,160
It's literally three trains!

2386
01:36:10,340 --> 01:36:11,800
Guys, this is a scam.

2387
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:16,680
It's literally four trains long!

2388
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:18,280
How is that?

2389
01:36:18,380 --> 01:36:18,960
Too long!

2390
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:22,200
Okay, there we go.

2391
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:26,040
Longest train is almost... Yeah!

2392
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:28,320
Like, it's not even that bad!

2393
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,740
Can I see the roof now?

2394
01:36:31,060 --> 01:36:31,600
Oh, okay.

2395
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:32,220
Now I can.

2396
01:36:32,540 --> 01:36:33,920
Alright, at least there's no...

2397
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:36,140
Guys, there's no more derailments, guys.

2398
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:36,780
I made it.

2399
01:36:37,220 --> 01:36:39,340
I didn't... I did not derail.

2400
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:40,240
Oh, hey!

2401
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:41,060
Alright, guys!

2402
01:36:42,940 --> 01:36:44,240
Guys, all aboard!

2403
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:44,800
All aboard!

2404
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:47,000
All aboard!

2405
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:48,460
Get on my train!

2406
01:36:49,820 --> 01:36:52,500
Come on, this guy looks like he's having fun!

2407
01:36:55,940 --> 01:36:58,820
Look at the excitement on this guy!

2408
01:37:00,140 --> 01:37:01,580
No, no, we're not closing.

2409
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:03,260
Come on, come on guys, come on.

2410
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:04,320
Come on, I don't care.

2411
01:37:04,380 --> 01:37:06,560
As many passengers in as possible, guys.

2412
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:09,420
There's no timer.

2413
01:37:09,460 --> 01:37:11,060
Come on, I know you guys want to!

2414
01:37:11,780 --> 01:37:12,580
All aboard!

2415
01:37:12,740 --> 01:37:14,660
No, no, no, we're not closing the doors!

2416
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,600
Come on, sir, I know you want to get on this train.

2417
01:37:18,420 --> 01:37:20,160
Dragoons, I know you want to get on.

2418
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:21,840
Oh, look, they're getting on!

2419
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:24,660
All right.

2420
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:27,020
No, no, no, don't worry, don't worry, red shirt guy!

2421
01:37:28,620 --> 01:37:31,140
There you go, don't worry, I got you, red shirt guy.

2422
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:32,780
I got you guys!

2423
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:33,680
All right.

2424
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:35,840
Now we start the train.

2425
01:37:36,780 --> 01:37:37,480
Okay, I learned.

2426
01:37:37,900 --> 01:37:39,120
It was like...

2427
01:37:40,220 --> 01:37:41,040
this after this.

2428
01:37:41,060 --> 01:37:42,760
50 and then boom.

2429
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:44,780
There we go.

2430
01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:48,820
Why don't we start it?

2431
01:37:48,860 --> 01:37:48,960
Oh.

2432
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:50,420
There we go.

2433
01:37:54,220 --> 01:37:55,080
We did it!

2434
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:56,680
Wait, what's the horn for this?

2435
01:37:59,380 --> 01:38:00,420
Oh, it's like the switch!

2436
01:38:09,820 --> 01:38:11,480
Where do we have to go?

2437
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:13,340
Let's see.

2438
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:14,120
Let's look at our map.

2439
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:15,700
We need to stop at LAMSEC.

2440
01:38:16,580 --> 01:38:17,480
Where are we?

2441
01:38:18,220 --> 01:38:19,040
LAMSEC 2.

2442
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:21,040
Where's our ride?

2443
01:38:22,580 --> 01:38:24,440
We're all the way here.

2444
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:28,180
So, I mean, that's a particularly long ride.

2445
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:30,120
Can't be that bad.

2446
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:31,760
All right.

2447
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:36,940
Okay, I think there's no more safety precautions, so we're fine.

2448
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:38,000
Right?

2449
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:39,540
Let's make sure there's no safety.

2450
01:38:41,620 --> 01:38:42,060
Let's...

2451
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:45,260
I think we'll be fine.

2452
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:48,380
Stick our head out.

2453
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:50,100
Look at that!

2454
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:53,100
Guys, we're doing so well this time.

2455
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:57,680
Oh, shit.

2456
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:59,000
How do I get closer?

2457
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:00,240
Oh, shit.

2458
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:00,920
That's not what I want.

2459
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:01,260
No!

2460
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:03,860
My train is moving away!

2461
01:39:06,550 --> 01:39:07,510
No train!

2462
01:39:09,470 --> 01:39:10,370
Oh, there we go.

2463
01:39:10,750 --> 01:39:11,510
There we go.

2464
01:39:11,690 --> 01:39:12,150
Nice.

2465
01:39:12,310 --> 01:39:12,590
All right.

2466
01:39:12,610 --> 01:39:14,810
I just wanted to, like, ride with the people.

2467
01:39:15,410 --> 01:39:16,330
Look at you guys.

2468
01:39:16,650 --> 01:39:18,030
I see you guys over there.

2469
01:39:18,930 --> 01:39:20,070
I see you guys.

2470
01:39:20,390 --> 01:39:20,870
Whoa.

2471
01:39:21,450 --> 01:39:22,590
You guys having fun?

2472
01:39:22,930 --> 01:39:23,710
Are you guys...

2473
01:39:23,710 --> 01:39:24,790
Oh, my God.

2474
01:39:24,810 --> 01:39:26,230
There's a full family in there.

2475
01:39:26,330 --> 01:39:27,910
Are you guys having fun, family?

2476
01:39:28,590 --> 01:39:29,710
What about over here?

2477
01:39:31,010 --> 01:39:31,870
Nobody here?

2478
01:39:31,870 --> 01:39:32,890
Where are the people?

2479
01:39:33,770 --> 01:39:34,530
Oh, look!

2480
01:39:34,670 --> 01:39:35,290
Another family!

2481
01:39:36,050 --> 01:39:36,810
Hey, guys!

2482
01:39:37,030 --> 01:39:37,370
Oh, no.

2483
01:39:37,430 --> 01:39:37,810
Never mind.

2484
01:39:37,910 --> 01:39:38,370
She's alone.

2485
01:39:39,170 --> 01:39:39,650
Wait.

2486
01:39:39,710 --> 01:39:40,530
There's birds, too!

2487
01:39:42,370 --> 01:39:44,010
I think I'm doing a great job.

2488
01:39:44,290 --> 01:39:47,650
Now that I'm not going full speed ahead, nobody can stop me.

2489
01:39:47,670 --> 01:39:48,010
You know what?

2490
01:39:48,110 --> 01:39:49,690
I'm feeling so wild.

2491
01:39:54,970 --> 01:39:57,150
I'm feeling so wild.

2492
01:40:00,890 --> 01:40:01,370
Look!

2493
01:40:01,550 --> 01:40:02,230
And then there's me!

2494
01:40:04,590 --> 01:40:05,530
There's me!

2495
01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:06,750
I'm right here!

2496
01:40:07,350 --> 01:40:08,590
Guys, that's me!

2497
01:40:09,370 --> 01:40:11,670
On my train skin suit!

2498
01:40:13,930 --> 01:40:16,790
You know, driving a train ain't that hard.

2499
01:40:17,210 --> 01:40:20,290
Don't know why people were freaking out earlier about it.

2500
01:40:20,930 --> 01:40:21,510
Okay.

2501
01:40:21,550 --> 01:40:22,670
I'm over here.

2502
01:40:23,370 --> 01:40:29,430
And we have to stop all the way over here?

2503
01:40:29,610 --> 01:40:30,030
No.

2504
01:40:30,150 --> 01:40:30,450
Wait.

2505
01:40:31,310 --> 01:40:31,990
Wait.

2506
01:40:32,010 --> 01:40:32,810
Where's Lamsac?

2507
01:40:33,810 --> 01:40:34,850
Where's Lamsac 2?

2508
01:40:38,170 --> 01:40:39,330
Wait a minute.

2509
01:40:41,530 --> 01:40:42,930
Wait a minute.

2510
01:40:44,110 --> 01:40:45,190
Oh, there it is.

2511
01:40:45,310 --> 01:40:45,570
Okay.

2512
01:40:45,610 --> 01:40:46,650
It's all the way here.

2513
01:40:47,590 --> 01:40:49,590
And I am...

2514
01:40:49,590 --> 01:40:50,650
Where again?

2515
01:40:52,170 --> 01:40:52,910
Oh, shit!

2516
01:40:52,950 --> 01:40:53,550
We're almost there!

2517
01:40:54,630 --> 01:40:55,390
Watch the...

2518
01:40:55,390 --> 01:40:57,990
Another train's not gonna hit us, guys!

2519
01:40:58,310 --> 01:40:59,170
We're fine!

2520
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:03,070
No other train's gonna hit us!

2521
01:41:03,190 --> 01:41:04,070
We're so safe!

2522
01:41:04,690 --> 01:41:05,190
Chat!

2523
01:41:05,510 --> 01:41:12,210
All the train training has saved us for this occasion, guys.

2524
01:41:13,250 --> 01:41:15,650
Our train training has led us to this.

2525
01:41:15,870 --> 01:41:17,670
We went to school for it.

2526
01:41:17,850 --> 01:41:19,070
So we'll be fine.

2527
01:41:19,890 --> 01:41:23,210
I can't believe someone's... I can't believe people buy DLC for this.

2528
01:41:23,830 --> 01:41:29,150
I can't believe people buy DLC for this.

2529
01:41:29,150 --> 01:41:29,950
Sorry.

2530
01:41:34,910 --> 01:41:37,070
Like, how different is the DLC?

2531
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:39,710
How different is the DLC?

2532
01:41:40,450 --> 01:41:42,130
Like, between trains?

2533
01:41:43,370 --> 01:41:45,670
Because, like, I bought the deluxe version.

2534
01:41:45,950 --> 01:41:47,190
Because I wanted more trains.

2535
01:41:47,890 --> 01:41:52,810
But, like, you wouldn't pick a train in Joy.

2536
01:41:54,190 --> 01:41:56,470
With that patch, there's no way I passed it.

2537
01:41:56,470 --> 01:42:01,490
I guess if, like, the train is, like, particularly interesting, I can see that.

2538
01:42:01,590 --> 01:42:02,810
No, I didn't pass it.

2539
01:42:02,870 --> 01:42:03,710
Where is it, though?

2540
01:42:04,730 --> 01:42:05,710
It's, like, right...

2541
01:42:06,230 --> 01:42:07,490
Oh, it's right here.

2542
01:42:07,650 --> 01:42:08,730
I didn't pass it.

2543
01:42:09,190 --> 01:42:11,930
I'm, like, so not even close to it, I think.

2544
01:42:12,370 --> 01:42:12,770
Wait.

2545
01:42:13,250 --> 01:42:14,730
Yeah, no, I'm not close to it.

2546
01:42:14,810 --> 01:42:15,390
At all.

2547
01:42:15,690 --> 01:42:16,990
It just adds more trains.

2548
01:42:17,130 --> 01:42:17,810
But do they just...

2549
01:42:17,810 --> 01:42:19,430
Do they look particularly different?

2550
01:42:20,330 --> 01:42:22,190
I mean, to be fair, I feel like...

2551
01:42:22,190 --> 01:42:23,070
Okay, not gonna lie.

2552
01:42:23,490 --> 01:42:24,510
I feel like this...

2553
01:42:24,510 --> 01:42:26,450
Buying train DLCs for this...

2554
01:42:26,450 --> 01:42:30,330
Is cheaper than owning, like, those, like, mini trains.

2555
01:42:30,550 --> 01:42:31,510
You know those train sets?

2556
01:42:31,890 --> 01:42:32,690
Oh, wait.

2557
01:42:32,810 --> 01:42:34,190
No, I can understand now.

2558
01:42:34,450 --> 01:42:36,610
Train enthusiasts go fucking hard.

2559
01:42:36,930 --> 01:42:38,350
Like, the train collect...

2560
01:42:38,350 --> 01:42:39,730
I watched Young Sheldon.

2561
01:42:39,890 --> 01:42:40,450
So...

2562
01:42:42,210 --> 01:42:42,770
Sorry.

2563
01:42:42,970 --> 01:42:45,370
That's, like, sort of my point of reference.

2564
01:42:45,650 --> 01:42:49,470
But, like, I watched Young Sheldon and he's, like, a train collector.

2565
01:42:58,210 --> 01:42:58,790
So...

2566
01:43:00,890 --> 01:43:02,050
So, like...

2567
01:43:02,050 --> 01:43:03,430
So, like, I...

2568
01:43:03,430 --> 01:43:04,330
I can...

2569
01:43:04,330 --> 01:43:04,730
I remember...

2570
01:43:04,730 --> 01:43:06,990
And then I remember back in the day...

2571
01:43:06,990 --> 01:43:07,810
Back...

2572
01:43:07,810 --> 01:43:09,650
It's a good show!

2573
01:43:09,950 --> 01:43:11,010
You can...

2574
01:43:11,010 --> 01:43:14,130
Okay, Big Bad Theory, that was, like, you know...

2575
01:43:14,130 --> 01:43:14,970
Eh.

2576
01:43:15,290 --> 01:43:16,210
But, like...

2577
01:43:16,210 --> 01:43:19,850
But, like, Young Sheldon is actually really decent.

2578
01:43:19,970 --> 01:43:20,510
Okay?

2579
01:43:20,610 --> 01:43:24,070
You guys just laugh because you've never watched Young Sheldon.

2580
01:43:24,130 --> 01:43:27,550
You've never watched Young Sheldon so you don't understand.

2581
01:43:27,550 --> 01:43:28,190
Okay?

2582
01:43:29,510 --> 01:43:29,990
So, it's a good show.

2583
01:43:29,990 --> 01:43:31,350
It's just, like, a family!

2584
01:43:31,670 --> 01:43:33,830
It's, like, a family wholesome show!

2585
01:43:34,190 --> 01:43:36,030
It's not always about Sheldon.

2586
01:43:36,150 --> 01:43:36,530
Guys.

2587
01:43:36,690 --> 01:43:39,410
There's other characters in Young Sheldon.

2588
01:43:44,110 --> 01:43:44,590
Anyway!

2589
01:43:45,170 --> 01:43:46,970
Anyway, I know, like, train...

2590
01:43:46,970 --> 01:43:50,210
Train enthusiasts go, like, super hardcore.

2591
01:43:50,690 --> 01:43:51,750
But, like...

2592
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:52,070
I...

2593
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:55,410
So, like, I know, like, there's, like, train conventions, too.

2594
01:43:55,630 --> 01:43:56,570
So, like, you know...

2595
01:43:56,570 --> 01:43:57,530
There's, like, anime conventions.

2596
01:43:57,590 --> 01:43:58,070
There's, like...

2597
01:44:07,830 --> 01:44:10,710
Oh, I'm almost there!

2598
01:44:10,930 --> 01:44:11,970
I'm almost there guys!

2599
01:44:28,070 --> 01:44:29,670
I feel like I'm dying.

2600
01:44:29,670 --> 01:44:37,110
I wonder if zoomers are feeling... you know how some interests are considered for not the young?

2601
01:44:37,390 --> 01:44:39,150
So, except for young Sheldon.

2602
01:44:39,530 --> 01:44:39,750
But...

2603
01:44:41,390 --> 01:44:51,350
So I do wonder if there's enough new blood to replace the audience, the consumer base for trained collectors.

2604
01:44:51,670 --> 01:44:53,110
Because I know there's like...

2605
01:44:54,130 --> 01:44:58,050
I don't really see much about it anymore like I do in the past.

2606
01:44:58,050 --> 01:44:59,550
We're almost there!

2607
01:45:00,030 --> 01:45:00,830
Oh my god!

2608
01:45:00,870 --> 01:45:04,090
We're gonna get to our first destination guys!

2609
01:45:04,870 --> 01:45:05,990
It's happening!

2610
01:45:06,710 --> 01:45:07,270
Chat!

2611
01:45:07,950 --> 01:45:11,250
We're gonna get to our first destination!

2612
01:45:12,130 --> 01:45:13,910
Oh my god, we're almost there!

2613
01:45:14,290 --> 01:45:15,410
Oh my god!

2614
01:45:16,370 --> 01:45:17,290
Oh my god!

2615
01:45:17,390 --> 01:45:18,490
We can slow down!

2616
01:45:18,730 --> 01:45:21,190
We're getting good at this game!

2617
01:45:22,690 --> 01:45:23,970
Wait, where's my train?

2618
01:45:24,190 --> 01:45:26,170
Guys, I don't know why I'm slowing down in time.

2619
01:45:26,630 --> 01:45:27,650
Guys, I don't...

2620
01:45:28,050 --> 01:45:29,230
Guys, I'm a little worried.

2621
01:45:30,990 --> 01:45:32,210
Guys, I'm a little worried.

2622
01:45:32,290 --> 01:45:33,110
I'm not slowing down.

2623
01:45:33,570 --> 01:45:35,110
I'm not slowing down enough.

2624
01:45:35,190 --> 01:45:36,230
Guys, I'm a little worried.

2625
01:45:36,270 --> 01:45:37,670
Guys, I think we're gonna miss our stop.

2626
01:45:37,790 --> 01:45:38,230
Guys, I'm...

2627
01:45:40,770 --> 01:45:44,570
Guys, I'm not slowing down.

2628
01:45:44,670 --> 01:45:45,750
Guys, I'm a little...

2629
01:45:46,350 --> 01:45:47,270
I'm a little worried.

2630
01:45:47,510 --> 01:45:49,770
Guys, I'm not slowing down!

2631
01:45:49,930 --> 01:45:51,550
The station is ahead of me!

2632
01:45:52,190 --> 01:45:52,590
Nooooo!

2633
01:45:55,010 --> 01:45:55,410
Nooooo!

2634
01:45:55,410 --> 01:45:57,550
Oh, I reached it!

2635
01:45:57,630 --> 01:45:58,110
I did it!

2636
01:45:58,290 --> 01:45:58,710
Okay.

2637
01:46:00,150 --> 01:46:00,910
Yeah!

2638
01:46:08,590 --> 01:46:09,350
Yeah!

2639
01:46:09,350 --> 01:46:09,910
Yeah!

2640
01:46:10,570 --> 01:46:11,330
Yeah!

2641
01:46:15,070 --> 01:46:16,450
We did it, chat!

2642
01:46:17,050 --> 01:46:18,570
We did it!

2643
01:46:18,630 --> 01:46:20,070
Never punished!

2644
01:46:20,710 --> 01:46:21,210
Woo!

2645
01:46:21,210 --> 01:46:21,270
Woo!

2646
01:46:25,410 --> 01:46:25,930
Yippee!

2647
01:46:26,350 --> 01:46:26,870
Yippee!

2648
01:46:27,650 --> 01:46:28,750
Guys, we did it!

2649
01:46:28,830 --> 01:46:30,530
Guys, we stopped at our destination!

2650
01:46:30,950 --> 01:46:31,370
Chat.

2651
01:46:33,010 --> 01:46:33,950
We're such good.

2652
01:46:34,110 --> 01:46:35,590
And the game crashed.

2653
01:46:36,010 --> 01:46:37,310
I think it's the game.

2654
01:46:37,690 --> 01:46:38,210
Wait!

2655
01:46:38,350 --> 01:46:39,190
Okay, alright, alright.

2656
01:46:39,650 --> 01:46:40,690
We'll do one more.

2657
01:46:41,590 --> 01:46:43,070
Suggest me a train DLC.

2658
01:46:44,370 --> 01:46:46,410
Suggest me a train DLC, guys.

2659
01:46:46,470 --> 01:46:49,350
It has $15,000 worth of trains.

2660
01:46:49,910 --> 01:46:51,130
It has $15,000 worth of trains.

2661
01:46:51,210 --> 01:46:54,230
Should I get guys for the train sim?

2662
01:46:54,270 --> 01:46:55,010
That's what I'm saying!

2663
01:46:55,150 --> 01:46:58,850
I'm saying this has to be cheaper than the train sets and stuff.

2664
01:46:59,390 --> 01:47:04,550
So now I sort of understand why there's so many DLCs.

2665
01:47:04,570 --> 01:47:04,690
So now I sort of understand why there's so many DLCs.

2666
01:47:04,690 --> 01:47:07,650
Because if you wanted to just own one of the trains, you can just...

2667
01:47:07,650 --> 01:47:08,610
I am not!

2668
01:47:09,530 --> 01:47:11,790
This is literally train simulator 2024!

2669
01:47:12,450 --> 01:47:13,970
What are you talking about?

2670
01:47:14,550 --> 01:47:15,750
How is there more?

2671
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:21,480
I mean, there's train sim world.

2672
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:22,760
I haven't played it.

2673
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:22,940
There's train sim world.

2674
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:23,460
There's train...

2675
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:27,180
What the fuck is train Siberian?

2676
01:47:28,600 --> 01:47:29,400
Railway simulator.

2677
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:32,080
Wait, I should have played this game.

2678
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:34,400
What the fuck?

2679
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:36,480
What the fuck?

2680
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:37,060
Wait, what?

2681
01:47:38,060 --> 01:47:40,000
What the fuck is this?

2682
01:47:40,380 --> 01:47:42,180
Alright guys, we're gonna like...

2683
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:44,100
I'm gonna buy this right now.

2684
01:47:44,180 --> 01:47:45,060
I'm gonna buy train Siberian.

2685
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:46,900
Alright guys, we're go...

2686
01:47:50,580 --> 01:47:52,640
You thought the ride was over.

2687
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:54,680
But there's a surprise game.

2688
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:56,800
There's a surprise game.

2689
01:47:58,040 --> 01:47:59,120
Oh my...

2690
01:47:59,120 --> 01:47:59,920
I saw...

2691
01:48:00,820 --> 01:48:02,400
Wait, it released like...

2692
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:03,520
On 30th May.

2693
01:48:03,660 --> 01:48:07,960
I literally saw this game while looking up train DLCs.

2694
01:48:07,980 --> 01:48:08,920
But like guys...

2695
01:48:08,920 --> 01:48:10,260
New game alert guys.

2696
01:48:14,680 --> 01:48:16,620
Give me a sec guys.

2697
01:48:16,700 --> 01:48:17,600
I'm installing it.

2698
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:18,360
Don't worry guys.

2699
01:48:18,640 --> 01:48:20,240
Guys, I checked the...

2700
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:22,100
It is 24 gigabytes.

2701
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:24,800
This cannot be well optimized.

2702
01:48:25,180 --> 01:48:27,640
I refuse to believe this game is.

2703
01:48:30,660 --> 01:48:31,380
Surprise.

2704
01:48:31,700 --> 01:48:33,580
Surprise second game.

2705
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:37,740
Guys, we're gonna be playing something called...

2706
01:48:37,740 --> 01:48:41,020
Trans-Siberian Railway Simulator.

2707
01:48:41,020 --> 01:48:41,580
Trans-Siberian Railway Simulator.

2708
01:48:41,580 --> 01:48:46,340
I saw 10 seconds of the gameplay footage where I shot...

2709
01:48:46,340 --> 01:48:46,520
I saw 10 seconds of the gameplay footage where I shot...

2710
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:47,020
Shoot a bear.

2711
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:48,620
And then I was like...

2712
01:48:48,620 --> 01:48:48,980
Wait.

2713
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:49,980
Wait.

2714
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:56,540
Wait a minute.

2715
01:48:57,720 --> 01:48:59,600
Wait a minute.

2716
01:49:02,300 --> 01:49:03,540
Then I got curious.

2717
01:49:03,940 --> 01:49:05,120
I got curious.

2718
01:49:06,180 --> 01:49:07,680
Trains and guns?

2719
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:09,160
Oh my god.

2720
01:49:09,480 --> 01:49:10,760
Okay, we're gonna...

2721
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:13,560
We have a little delay here.

2722
01:49:13,940 --> 01:49:15,720
It still has to do with trains though.

2723
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:16,660
Don't worry.

2724
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:17,900
Trains are still involved.

2725
01:49:18,440 --> 01:49:19,500
Alright, before that.

2726
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:21,140
Let's go back to the other train DLC.

2727
01:49:21,560 --> 01:49:23,220
Train Simulator Classic.

2728
01:49:23,220 --> 01:49:25,400
What kind of trains are your favorite?

2729
01:49:25,660 --> 01:49:27,420
My train enthusiast!

2730
01:49:29,420 --> 01:49:31,140
My train enthusiast!

2731
01:49:31,540 --> 01:49:33,900
Which trains are your favorite trains?

2732
01:49:35,380 --> 01:49:37,820
It might make me buy your train.

2733
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:43,440
This is it.

2734
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:44,580
This is your chance.

2735
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:45,940
Train enthusiast.

2736
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:49,900
To tell me your favorite train.

2737
01:49:50,700 --> 01:49:51,780
What is this?

2738
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:54,960
Train Simulator...

2739
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:55,540
Oh my god.

2740
01:49:55,620 --> 01:49:56,360
What is this?

2741
01:49:56,520 --> 01:49:58,020
Isn't this like the...

2742
01:49:58,020 --> 01:50:00,380
How is that a train?

2743
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:03,680
We're not spending $15,000 on a train...

2744
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:05,460
Train DLC guys.

2745
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:07,760
Guys, $15,000?

2746
01:50:07,860 --> 01:50:09,780
I can buy so many other things.

2747
01:50:09,900 --> 01:50:11,760
I can drop by multiple things.

2748
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:12,300
Chat.

2749
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:14,780
We're not spending $15,000.

2750
01:50:16,140 --> 01:50:18,440
This is not where our investments go.

2751
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:19,260
Wait!

2752
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:21,280
You know Thomas the Tank Engine?

2753
01:50:21,900 --> 01:50:23,460
What kind of train is that?

2754
01:50:24,220 --> 01:50:27,540
Is there a train simulator train of Thomas the Tank Engine?

2755
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:32,720
Train Simulator train of Thomas the Tank Engine.

2756
01:50:32,720 --> 01:50:34,540
Train Simulator train of Thomas the Tank Engine?

2757
01:50:34,540 --> 01:50:35,040
Guys...

2758
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:36,380
Train Enthusiast.

2759
01:50:36,440 --> 01:50:38,920
What kind of train is Thomas the Tank Engine?

2760
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:40,760
A tank...

2761
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:43,720
Okay, Mr. Fancy Pants...

2762
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:48,660
A Tank En- He must have an actual train name, okay?

2763
01:50:48,740 --> 01:50:49,240
Okay, I get it.

2764
01:50:49,260 --> 01:50:51,840
Yes, I know he's a tank engine.

2765
01:50:52,200 --> 01:50:55,240
But like what kind of tank engine?

2766
01:50:59,020 --> 01:51:01,540
Like yes, I know he's a king.

2767
01:51:04,140 --> 01:51:05,680
What's the closest thing?

2768
01:51:05,980 --> 01:51:09,180
Oh, an E... Oh my god, you guys actually...

2769
01:51:09,180 --> 01:51:12,120
Okay, do I have the E2 locomotive?

2770
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:16,180
E2 loco... locomotive.

2771
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:18,120
Mr. Ashley?

2772
01:51:18,740 --> 01:51:19,460
Nooooo!

2773
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:22,220
What do you mean?

2774
01:51:23,180 --> 01:51:27,220
How am I supposed to fucking drive Thomas the Tank Engine?

2775
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:32,620
An absolute weakling.

2776
01:51:35,720 --> 01:51:37,200
Oh my god.

2777
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:39,780
I need my real train enthusiast.

2778
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:43,260
Do they have the DLC of it though?

2779
01:51:44,040 --> 01:51:46,040
Like that's all I wanna know.

2780
01:51:46,180 --> 01:51:48,180
Do they have the DLC?

2781
01:51:51,160 --> 01:51:55,780
Someone tell me if Thomas the Tank Engine has a similar DLC.

2782
01:51:57,930 --> 01:51:59,600
That's all I wanna know.

2783
01:52:03,780 --> 01:52:05,420
Type 06OT.

2784
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:06,320
Okay.

2785
01:52:08,980 --> 01:52:10,620
06... 06...

2786
01:52:12,180 --> 01:52:13,820
O... T...

2787
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:16,120
Okay.

2788
01:52:16,180 --> 01:52:17,800
Okay, what the fuck did you like...

2789
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:19,480
made me type?

2790
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:22,120
That was nothing to do with trains.

2791
01:52:25,820 --> 01:52:26,540
Nooooo!

2792
01:52:28,900 --> 01:52:33,360
All I wanted was to drive a Thomas the Tank Engine.

2793
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,720
That's all I want.

2794
01:52:40,940 --> 01:52:41,300
That's...

2795
01:52:42,180 --> 01:52:43,780
That's all I want.

2796
01:52:43,780 --> 01:52:49,580
But I couldn't find a simulator that simulated Thomas' train.

2797
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:51,920
I can't believe it.

2798
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:56,280
I was willing to spend money on driving a...

2799
01:52:56,540 --> 01:52:58,640
a... a Thomas the Tank Engine.

2800
01:52:59,460 --> 01:53:02,200
It might not have been $15,000.

2801
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:04,980
But it was close enough.

2802
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:06,820
It was...

2803
01:53:08,620 --> 01:53:09,500
I...

2804
01:53:10,660 --> 01:53:13,340
I could have almost spent something...

2805
01:53:13,340 --> 01:53:15,780
Something similar to $15,000.

2806
01:53:18,300 --> 01:53:20,760
But I couldn't find...

2807
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:23,600
I couldn't find the right train.

2808
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:26,220
Nooooo!

2809
01:53:28,300 --> 01:53:32,140
Try the Fowler 4F Loco.

2810
01:53:32,580 --> 01:53:36,120
Guys, my train enthusiasts, you're all failing me right now.

2811
01:53:37,120 --> 01:53:38,200
You're all...

2812
01:53:38,200 --> 01:53:38,300
You're all...

2813
01:53:39,780 --> 01:53:40,700
You're all...

2814
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:43,320
You're all...

2815
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:43,680
Guys...

2816
01:53:44,300 --> 01:53:45,780
Guys, I thought you knew all of...

2817
01:53:45,780 --> 01:53:46,640
I thought you knew.

2818
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:48,760
I thought you knew!

2819
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:50,520
About...

2820
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:53,980
I thought you knew if there were trains that looked like it.

2821
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:54,820
Okay, Fowler.

2822
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:56,920
Ooh, Fowler 4K.

2823
01:53:57,460 --> 01:53:58,320
4F Loco.

2824
01:53:58,420 --> 01:54:00,920
I mean, I guess it looks like Thomas the...

2825
01:54:02,020 --> 01:54:03,440
Thomas the Tank Engine.

2826
01:54:03,740 --> 01:54:04,360
Oh, okay.

2827
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:05,220
We'll try that.

2828
01:54:05,680 --> 01:54:07,320
All right, I just want to look at it.

2829
01:54:07,420 --> 01:54:07,860
Okay.

2830
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:09,400
I'm paying for it.

2831
01:54:09,660 --> 01:54:10,640
I bought it.

2832
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:14,000
Alright.

2833
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:14,900
Okay, you're right.

2834
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:16,380
We all fail each other.

2835
01:54:17,940 --> 01:54:19,660
Guys, I'm installing the update.

2836
01:54:19,960 --> 01:54:20,440
Alright?

2837
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:22,240
Alright, don't worry.

2838
01:54:22,360 --> 01:54:24,660
I'm sorry for ever doubting you, my train enthusiast.

2839
01:54:25,380 --> 01:54:27,420
I'm sorry for ever doubting you guys.

2840
01:54:29,540 --> 01:54:30,120
It's okay.

2841
01:54:30,220 --> 01:54:30,840
We found him.

2842
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:31,600
We found him.

2843
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:32,260
We found Thomas.

2844
01:54:33,120 --> 01:54:33,600
Guys.

2845
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:36,500
We found Thomas, guys.

2846
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:39,120
Alright.

2847
01:54:39,260 --> 01:54:40,240
It was like $9.

2848
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:41,000
Okay.

2849
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:41,140
Okay.

2850
01:54:41,540 --> 01:54:44,060
Now that I said it out loud, that was a lot.

2851
01:54:45,480 --> 01:54:49,160
That was a lot for a train skin, now that I said that.

2852
01:54:49,600 --> 01:54:52,360
Okay, maybe it was... maybe...

2853
01:54:53,180 --> 01:54:57,780
Maybe it was not the best idea to buy that.

2854
01:54:59,900 --> 01:55:01,180
Wait, where's my train?

2855
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:04,860
Where the fuck is my train that I paid money for?

2856
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:08,280
Is that it?

2857
01:55:08,680 --> 01:55:09,540
Is that it?

2858
01:55:10,350 --> 01:55:11,580
I bought this one, right?

2859
01:55:12,340 --> 01:55:13,760
I bought this one.

2860
01:55:14,260 --> 01:55:15,520
Holy shit.

2861
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:17,180
What the fuck?

2862
01:55:22,510 --> 01:55:23,970
What the fuck?

2863
01:55:24,010 --> 01:55:25,090
There's so many trains.

2864
01:55:25,530 --> 01:55:27,730
There's so many things part of this train.

2865
01:55:28,190 --> 01:55:29,350
What the fuck?

2866
01:55:31,030 --> 01:55:31,610
Alright.

2867
01:55:32,070 --> 01:55:32,990
That's a lot.

2868
01:55:36,350 --> 01:55:38,050
There's no face on it, though.

2869
01:55:38,130 --> 01:55:38,530
It's okay.

2870
01:55:38,590 --> 01:55:40,250
We can... we can pretend.

2871
01:55:40,790 --> 01:55:42,170
Oh my god!

2872
01:55:42,290 --> 01:55:43,130
What the...

2873
01:55:43,230 --> 01:55:43,530
What the fuck?

2874
01:55:46,210 --> 01:55:49,910
Guys, I did not learn how to drive this train.

2875
01:55:50,310 --> 01:55:51,570
I did not.

2876
01:55:52,250 --> 01:55:52,850
Okay.

2877
01:55:53,030 --> 01:55:53,750
It's okay.

2878
01:55:53,910 --> 01:55:54,930
Things will be okay.

2879
01:55:55,390 --> 01:55:56,310
Alright, guys.

2880
01:55:56,510 --> 01:55:56,730
We...

2881
01:55:56,730 --> 01:55:58,850
Alright, who wants to ride this train?

2882
01:56:00,330 --> 01:56:02,070
All the... What the fuck?

2883
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:05,420
This is not fair.

2884
01:56:06,860 --> 01:56:12,040
This is actually not... The British Railway is in like... Is this like in...

2885
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:13,100
Where are we?

2886
01:56:13,120 --> 01:56:13,920
Is this German?

2887
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:15,120
Is this...

2888
01:56:20,010 --> 01:56:22,190
Why are we here?

2889
01:56:22,550 --> 01:56:24,150
We're not playing a Thomas song.

2890
01:56:24,230 --> 01:56:25,810
I don't want to get copyrighted.

2891
01:56:25,810 --> 01:56:29,710
I don't want to share my revenue with fucking a BBC right now.

2892
01:56:30,790 --> 01:56:32,070
This is not fair.

2893
01:56:32,690 --> 01:56:34,930
How come this train can be so long?

2894
01:56:35,170 --> 01:56:37,550
And then my train got like... was too long.

2895
01:56:39,950 --> 01:56:41,550
I can't believe it.

2896
01:56:42,610 --> 01:56:43,130
Okay.

2897
01:56:43,150 --> 01:56:46,330
It feels so wrong to have a British train here in Germany.

2898
01:56:46,350 --> 01:56:47,130
Right now.

2899
01:56:47,350 --> 01:56:48,110
But like...

2900
01:56:48,110 --> 01:56:49,790
Like how did it get here?

2901
01:56:50,070 --> 01:56:52,510
How did Thomas... Thomas, how did you get here, Thomas?

2902
01:56:55,330 --> 01:56:57,070
Thomas, how did you get here?

2903
01:56:58,430 --> 01:57:00,870
There should be no safety for this one.

2904
01:57:01,450 --> 01:57:03,310
I refuse to... Oh, wait.

2905
01:57:03,410 --> 01:57:03,850
Fuck.

2906
01:57:03,930 --> 01:57:04,750
There's... We need water.

2907
01:57:05,610 --> 01:57:06,630
God damn it.

2908
01:57:07,910 --> 01:57:09,390
Oh, the horn might be cool.

2909
01:57:10,350 --> 01:57:11,910
We have the classic horn!

2910
01:57:12,810 --> 01:57:13,770
Choo-choo.

2911
01:57:14,150 --> 01:57:16,210
Best nine dollars I spent.

2912
01:57:19,290 --> 01:57:20,410
Choo-choo.

2913
01:57:20,670 --> 01:57:20,750
Choo -choo.

2914
01:57:21,350 --> 01:57:22,190
Choo-choo.

2915
01:57:23,770 --> 01:57:24,330
Choo-choo.

2916
01:57:24,330 --> 01:57:24,450
Yay!

2917
01:57:28,450 --> 01:57:29,230
It's okay.

2918
01:57:29,390 --> 01:57:30,750
If we derail, we derail.

2919
01:57:32,090 --> 01:57:34,210
God, this is such a slow train.

2920
01:57:36,890 --> 01:57:37,810
Oh no.

2921
01:57:37,890 --> 01:57:39,370
How far do we have to go?

2922
01:57:39,810 --> 01:57:42,250
This is such a slow train.

2923
01:57:42,750 --> 01:57:43,310
Okay.

2924
01:57:43,910 --> 01:57:46,670
Stop at Coswick platform four.

2925
01:57:46,870 --> 01:57:47,750
Where am I?

2926
01:57:48,670 --> 01:57:49,270
Okay.

2927
01:57:49,350 --> 01:57:50,590
It's not that bad.

2928
01:57:51,730 --> 01:57:53,030
Coswick is here.

2929
01:57:53,310 --> 01:57:55,470
And I'm like over here.

2930
01:57:55,990 --> 01:57:57,590
It's not that bad.

2931
01:57:59,930 --> 01:58:01,230
I thought...

2932
01:58:01,230 --> 01:58:02,050
Okay.

2933
01:58:02,130 --> 01:58:04,210
But like the train is fucking slow.

2934
01:58:04,470 --> 01:58:06,570
Like I... Like this is...

2935
01:58:06,570 --> 01:58:08,810
It's... It's... It's getting there.

2936
01:58:09,170 --> 01:58:09,850
It's...

2937
01:58:13,410 --> 01:58:15,510
It's... It's very lower accurate.

2938
01:58:15,710 --> 01:58:16,390
But...

2939
01:58:17,610 --> 01:58:20,190
But like, you know, it's getting there.

2940
01:58:20,310 --> 01:58:23,190
A better train horn from Choo-choo... Choo-choo Charles.

2941
01:58:23,350 --> 01:58:23,810
Am I right?

2942
01:58:24,170 --> 01:58:25,530
Zero, thank you, Super Chat.

2943
01:58:25,670 --> 01:58:25,930
Thank you.

2944
01:58:25,990 --> 01:58:26,710
Thank you.

2945
01:58:28,150 --> 01:58:28,590
It's okay.

2946
01:58:28,910 --> 01:58:30,610
Wait, can I put more coal?

2947
01:58:31,690 --> 01:58:32,250
Blower.

2948
01:58:32,910 --> 01:58:33,470
Sounder.

2949
01:58:33,770 --> 01:58:34,330
More.

2950
01:58:35,330 --> 01:58:35,890
More!

2951
01:58:37,090 --> 01:58:38,570
Blow it up!

2952
01:58:39,170 --> 01:58:41,270
I want more steam!

2953
01:58:41,910 --> 01:58:43,570
Coming out of that hole!

2954
01:58:45,890 --> 01:58:46,410
Okay.

2955
01:58:46,810 --> 01:58:50,650
There's a reason why I fucking shipped this train to Germany.

2956
01:58:51,710 --> 01:58:53,570
I want more steam!

2957
01:58:54,350 --> 01:58:55,530
Guys, we're running out of water.

2958
01:58:55,890 --> 01:58:57,250
I don't think we're gonna make it.

2959
01:59:01,050 --> 01:59:02,610
There's no passages here!

2960
01:59:02,770 --> 01:59:03,350
It doesn't matter!

2961
01:59:04,990 --> 01:59:05,510
If...

2962
01:59:06,250 --> 01:59:11,110
All I'm saying is like, if we run out of water, we'll just abandon the train in the middle of the railway.

2963
01:59:11,810 --> 01:59:13,470
It's... It's the government's problem.

2964
01:59:13,470 --> 01:59:14,050
It's not my problem after that.

2965
01:59:14,250 --> 01:59:15,450
It's not my problem.

2966
01:59:15,630 --> 01:59:16,810
I'm a private train owner.

2967
01:59:18,330 --> 01:59:19,170
Wait, no.

2968
01:59:19,610 --> 01:59:21,030
Railways are monopolized.

2969
01:59:21,050 --> 01:59:21,350
Nevermind.

2970
01:59:21,830 --> 01:59:22,390
Whoever...

2971
01:59:22,390 --> 01:59:24,930
I don't know if the government in Germany owns the railway.

2972
01:59:25,210 --> 01:59:28,390
But like, whoever owns this railway, it's their problem.

2973
01:59:28,670 --> 01:59:29,350
Not mine.

2974
01:59:29,630 --> 01:59:31,110
Oh shit, my brakes were on.

2975
01:59:31,450 --> 01:59:32,810
Is that why I was so slow?

2976
01:59:33,250 --> 01:59:34,530
That would make sense.

2977
01:59:35,410 --> 01:59:36,190
I think?

2978
01:59:36,790 --> 01:59:38,670
No, I'm just equally as slow.

2979
01:59:38,870 --> 01:59:39,790
It doesn't matter.

2980
01:59:40,110 --> 01:59:40,890
It does...

2981
01:59:43,530 --> 01:59:44,990
Guys, it doesn't matter!

2982
01:59:45,110 --> 01:59:46,250
I'm so fucking slow!

2983
01:59:46,710 --> 01:59:48,330
It doesn't matter.

2984
01:59:50,030 --> 01:59:52,090
Oh, the water is going down.

2985
01:59:52,490 --> 01:59:53,590
Am I closer?

2986
01:59:54,510 --> 01:59:55,810
Am I getting closer?

2987
01:59:56,170 --> 01:59:56,650
Where am I?

2988
01:59:57,550 --> 01:59:58,490
Show task.

2989
02:00:00,010 --> 02:00:01,190
Oh, we are...

2990
02:00:01,190 --> 02:00:03,910
We are not making it, guys.

2991
02:00:04,530 --> 02:00:08,530
We are absolutely not making it, guys.

2992
02:00:08,630 --> 02:00:09,490
There is...

2993
02:00:09,490 --> 02:00:11,430
There is a long way.

2994
02:00:11,630 --> 02:00:12,070
You know what?

2995
02:00:12,070 --> 02:00:13,730
We might as well use up all the water.

2996
02:00:14,110 --> 02:00:15,410
We might as well.

2997
02:00:15,490 --> 02:00:17,250
There is no other choice, guys.

2998
02:00:17,590 --> 02:00:18,750
There is no other choice.

2999
02:00:19,210 --> 02:00:21,770
If we run out, we leave the train here.

3000
02:00:23,810 --> 02:00:24,670
Somebody quick!

3001
02:00:25,310 --> 02:00:26,450
Shovel more coal!

3002
02:00:27,130 --> 02:00:29,190
Somebody down over there!

3003
02:00:29,370 --> 02:00:31,830
And like, I don't know, train number 10!

3004
02:00:33,630 --> 02:00:35,050
Train number 10!

3005
02:00:35,670 --> 02:00:38,410
Shovel more coal, dragoons!

3006
02:00:39,450 --> 02:00:40,310
Shovel more!

3007
02:00:42,070 --> 02:00:46,130
We need to get to Coswig platform 4!

3008
02:00:47,770 --> 02:00:50,790
Guys, this train is moving even slower.

3009
02:00:51,830 --> 02:00:52,970
I can't believe it.

3010
02:00:52,990 --> 02:00:56,590
We are at a solid 12.5 miles per hour right now.

3011
02:00:58,930 --> 02:01:00,290
It doesn't...

3012
02:01:00,290 --> 02:01:02,350
It doesn't matter how...

3013
02:01:02,350 --> 02:01:06,150
If I could put that lever to 150...

3014
02:01:06,150 --> 02:01:06,930
Like...

3015
02:01:09,530 --> 02:01:11,310
It wouldn't matter.

3016
02:01:11,690 --> 02:01:13,370
We are at a solid...

3017
02:01:13,370 --> 02:01:14,050
Oh my god!

3018
02:01:14,090 --> 02:01:15,010
We are going up!

3019
02:01:15,850 --> 02:01:17,870
It's 14.7!

3020
02:01:18,770 --> 02:01:19,490
Guys...

3021
02:01:20,270 --> 02:01:20,990
Guys...

3022
02:01:20,990 --> 02:01:22,150
We made it!

3023
02:01:22,670 --> 02:01:25,710
We are at a solid 16.3 now!

3024
02:01:27,830 --> 02:01:29,030
This is it.

3025
02:01:29,650 --> 02:01:30,870
Choo-choo!

3026
02:01:31,450 --> 02:01:32,170
Choo!

3027
02:01:33,750 --> 02:01:34,910
Choo-choo!

3028
02:01:34,910 --> 02:01:36,310
Choo-choo!

3029
02:01:39,750 --> 02:01:40,250
Faster!

3030
02:01:40,490 --> 02:01:41,350
Oh my god.

3031
02:01:41,390 --> 02:01:42,750
Guys, we are over the speed limit.

3032
02:01:43,010 --> 02:01:47,530
It says 10, but we are at 20.2, because we don't give a .

3033
02:01:48,190 --> 02:01:52,070
We don't care.

3034
02:01:52,910 --> 02:01:54,670
Can it get any higher?

3035
02:01:55,610 --> 02:01:58,690
Because I don't think so, because we are at 30% water.

3036
02:01:59,150 --> 02:01:59,930
But it's okay.

3037
02:02:00,130 --> 02:02:02,070
The closer we get there...

3038
02:02:02,070 --> 02:02:03,650
The closer we can like...

3039
02:02:03,650 --> 02:02:04,670
Just leave the train!

3040
02:02:06,990 --> 02:02:08,970
23.5, it's slowly going up guys.

3041
02:02:09,410 --> 02:02:10,630
It's slowly going up.

3042
02:02:10,710 --> 02:02:11,290
Where are we?

3043
02:02:11,450 --> 02:02:12,210
Where are we?

3044
02:02:12,290 --> 02:02:14,090
Wait, we might be able to make it!

3045
02:02:15,310 --> 02:02:15,710
Guys!

3046
02:02:15,710 --> 02:02:17,030
We might be able to make it!

3047
02:02:17,070 --> 02:02:17,210
Look!

3048
02:02:17,850 --> 02:02:18,650
That's the train!

3049
02:02:19,650 --> 02:02:20,990
That's where we need to get!

3050
02:02:22,050 --> 02:02:23,330
Guys, I think we can do it.

3051
02:02:24,010 --> 02:02:25,470
Guys, I think we can do it guys.

3052
02:02:26,710 --> 02:02:27,430
Pressure is dropping?

3053
02:02:27,670 --> 02:02:28,270
Where's the pressure?

3054
02:02:28,570 --> 02:02:29,290
What do you mean?

3055
02:02:29,770 --> 02:02:31,230
What do you mean by pressure?

3056
02:02:31,290 --> 02:02:32,070
Is this pressure?

3057
02:02:32,330 --> 02:02:32,730
PSI?

3058
02:02:32,730 --> 02:02:34,630
Is that what pressure stands for?

3059
02:02:36,390 --> 02:02:37,970
Guess it here like a...

3060
02:02:38,690 --> 02:02:39,470
Oh hey!

3061
02:02:40,930 --> 02:02:43,670
This train is so up in the front right now.

3062
02:02:46,070 --> 02:02:50,470
I can't believe this train can have like 20 fucking carts and I can't...

3063
02:02:51,130 --> 02:02:53,670
And I can't have like six...

3064
02:02:54,610 --> 02:02:55,490
Passenger carts.

3065
02:02:55,650 --> 02:02:57,850
Just because I have people in mind.

3066
02:02:58,330 --> 02:03:00,250
Like... like who cares?

3067
02:03:05,130 --> 02:03:10,650
Like... so what if I have people in my train and they won't let me add more...

3068
02:03:10,650 --> 02:03:10,990
Oh wait!

3069
02:03:11,050 --> 02:03:12,750
I have a co-pilot?

3070
02:03:13,570 --> 02:03:14,750
What the fuck are you?

3071
02:03:15,490 --> 02:03:17,430
What the fuck is this old man on my train?

3072
02:03:18,210 --> 02:03:19,490
Running low on water?

3073
02:03:20,370 --> 02:03:22,610
That's a good time for me to ditch this train then.

3074
02:03:23,250 --> 02:03:23,950
It's alright.

3075
02:03:24,090 --> 02:03:26,450
If we run out of water, it was just meant to be.

3076
02:03:26,890 --> 02:03:30,490
I mean we literally shipped this... a British railway train.

3077
02:03:31,150 --> 02:03:33,570
Steam British Railway train to Germany.

3078
02:03:33,910 --> 02:03:35,650
We are not keeping this train.

3079
02:03:37,350 --> 02:03:38,090
Oh yeah!

3080
02:03:38,130 --> 02:03:39,190
The coal shoveler!

3081
02:03:39,810 --> 02:03:41,670
That's the dragon who's shoveling coal!

3082
02:03:41,770 --> 02:03:42,430
That's you guys!

3083
02:03:42,850 --> 02:03:43,310
That's you!

3084
02:03:43,410 --> 02:03:43,630
Yeah!

3085
02:03:43,650 --> 02:03:44,730
I'm talking about you dragon!

3086
02:03:45,330 --> 02:03:45,770
Yeah!

3087
02:03:45,830 --> 02:03:47,470
That one dragon over there!

3088
02:03:47,770 --> 02:03:48,670
I'm talking about you!

3089
02:03:49,290 --> 02:03:49,930
Yes you!

3090
02:03:50,110 --> 02:03:52,230
You get the job to be a coal shoveler!

3091
02:03:52,990 --> 02:03:53,430
Congratulations!

3092
02:03:53,930 --> 02:03:55,470
Guys we don't... we're not making it.

3093
02:03:55,530 --> 02:03:56,250
We have 7%.

3094
02:03:57,590 --> 02:03:58,430
We have...

3095
02:03:58,430 --> 02:04:00,010
We have 7% left.

3096
02:04:00,150 --> 02:04:00,470
We have 7% left.

3097
02:04:00,490 --> 02:04:02,150
Guys we're so close too.

3098
02:04:02,290 --> 02:04:03,650
That was the... that's the worst part.

3099
02:04:03,990 --> 02:04:05,090
We're so close.

3100
02:04:05,310 --> 02:04:06,550
This train was never...

3101
02:04:06,550 --> 02:04:06,810
No!

3102
02:04:10,770 --> 02:04:13,570
That train was never meant to head there.

3103
02:04:14,690 --> 02:04:15,510
Alright guys.

3104
02:04:15,690 --> 02:04:17,270
Now we're gonna head to Siberia.

3105
02:04:20,570 --> 02:04:21,090
Yes.

3106
02:04:21,090 --> 02:04:23,150
We're gonna head to Siberia now.

3107
02:04:23,230 --> 02:04:24,970
I need to know what this game is.

3108
02:04:25,070 --> 02:04:26,190
I need to know.

3109
02:04:27,590 --> 02:04:29,650
Guys we're gonna... we're gonna head over.

3110
02:04:30,490 --> 02:04:30,710
Yes.

3111
02:04:31,490 --> 02:04:33,030
We're gonna head to Siberia.

3112
02:04:39,270 --> 02:04:40,170
New game.

3113
02:04:41,250 --> 02:04:42,250
It's still trains.

3114
02:04:42,470 --> 02:04:43,530
So it still counts.

3115
02:04:44,290 --> 02:04:44,890
Guys.

3116
02:04:44,970 --> 02:04:47,510
It still has to do with trains guys.

3117
02:04:49,050 --> 02:04:50,450
I got curious.

3118
02:04:50,890 --> 02:04:51,490
Okay?

3119
02:04:52,550 --> 02:04:54,750
Okay I don't know if Sound Guy is still alive.

3120
02:04:55,370 --> 02:04:59,350
But we have a new thing to balance for you.

3121
02:04:59,350 --> 02:05:00,330
Alright.

3122
02:05:00,450 --> 02:05:00,910
Let's see.

3123
02:05:00,990 --> 02:05:01,910
Video graphics.

3124
02:05:02,530 --> 02:05:03,430
Borderless windows.

3125
02:05:03,630 --> 02:05:04,210
Hell yeah.

3126
02:05:04,410 --> 02:05:04,890
FPS.

3127
02:05:05,410 --> 02:05:10,130
Now why don't we not have unlimited FPS for whatever this game is?

3128
02:05:11,330 --> 02:05:13,610
I don't know what this game is.

3129
02:05:13,790 --> 02:05:16,470
But what if we don't do that?

3130
02:05:18,890 --> 02:05:19,490
Alright.

3131
02:05:21,750 --> 02:05:22,650
Sound Guy.

3132
02:05:22,770 --> 02:05:25,130
Sound Guy we need you more than ever.

3133
02:05:30,310 --> 02:05:30,870
Alright.

3134
02:05:31,010 --> 02:05:31,570
Alright.

3135
02:05:31,730 --> 02:05:32,310
Let's see.

3136
02:05:33,130 --> 02:05:33,690
Alright.

3137
02:05:34,230 --> 02:05:36,890
I just wanted to punch a bear.

3138
02:05:37,230 --> 02:05:38,210
On a train.

3139
02:05:38,610 --> 02:05:39,690
Play with survival.

3140
02:05:40,110 --> 02:05:40,650
Play without.

3141
02:05:40,930 --> 02:05:41,990
Manage the locomotive.

3142
02:05:42,290 --> 02:05:42,850
Alright.

3143
02:05:42,950 --> 02:05:45,970
We're gonna complete missions for the mafia?

3144
02:05:46,350 --> 02:05:47,710
What kind of...

3145
02:05:48,950 --> 02:05:49,510
Okay.

3146
02:05:49,550 --> 02:05:49,830
Okay.

3147
02:05:49,870 --> 02:05:50,430
Now...

3148
02:05:50,430 --> 02:05:51,350
Okay.

3149
02:05:51,770 --> 02:05:52,330
Okay.

3150
02:05:52,330 --> 02:05:52,530
Okay.

3151
02:05:52,530 --> 02:05:52,810
Okay.

3152
02:05:52,810 --> 02:05:53,230
Okay.

3153
02:05:54,630 --> 02:05:55,190
Okay.

3154
02:05:58,470 --> 02:05:59,110
Okay.

3155
02:05:59,210 --> 02:05:59,910
Now I'm curious.

3156
02:06:00,010 --> 02:06:01,970
What the fuck is this story mode?

3157
02:06:02,550 --> 02:06:03,190
Alright.

3158
02:06:03,590 --> 02:06:04,690
What is this?

3159
02:06:05,190 --> 02:06:07,390
It's still train related technically.

3160
02:06:12,790 --> 02:06:14,010
What is this?

3161
02:06:14,970 --> 02:06:15,610
Hello.

3162
02:06:20,510 --> 02:06:21,610
What the fuck?

3163
02:06:23,070 --> 02:06:24,670
I have to go to the shop?

3164
02:06:25,490 --> 02:06:26,490
I have money?

3165
02:06:27,610 --> 02:06:29,850
Oh Billy thank you for the super chat.

3166
02:06:30,010 --> 02:06:30,370
Thank you.

3167
02:06:30,390 --> 02:06:31,150
Thank you.

3168
02:06:31,730 --> 02:06:33,830
What the fuck is this?

3169
02:06:40,090 --> 02:06:41,930
I have flashlights?

3170
02:06:42,270 --> 02:06:43,450
Where the fuck...

3171
02:06:43,450 --> 02:06:45,710
What is this?

3172
02:06:46,250 --> 02:06:47,650
Oh my god there's bread.

3173
02:06:49,510 --> 02:06:50,610
There's a knife?

3174
02:06:50,690 --> 02:06:51,750
What am I gonna do with a knife?

3175
02:06:51,970 --> 02:06:53,510
I thought I'm just driving a train.

3176
02:06:54,550 --> 02:06:56,690
Oh I have to go to the mafia shop.

3177
02:06:57,370 --> 02:06:59,110
Not the regular shop.

3178
02:07:01,950 --> 02:07:03,170
What is this?

3179
02:07:03,290 --> 02:07:03,670
It's...

3180
02:07:04,470 --> 02:07:05,870
Siberian train station?

3181
02:07:05,890 --> 02:07:06,330
Oh it's a simulator.

3182
02:07:07,230 --> 02:07:08,570
So I got curious.

3183
02:07:11,950 --> 02:07:12,970
Oh my god.

3184
02:07:13,150 --> 02:07:13,670
Do I...

3185
02:07:15,150 --> 02:07:15,590
Wait.

3186
02:07:15,690 --> 02:07:16,870
Where do I have to go?

3187
02:07:17,870 --> 02:07:19,130
You're at the...

3188
02:07:19,630 --> 02:07:21,970
In the lower... You can see the status of your money.

3189
02:07:22,210 --> 02:07:23,330
In the lower right.

3190
02:07:23,450 --> 02:07:24,970
On the top level of your characters.

3191
02:07:25,090 --> 02:07:26,110
Make sure they're on the right level.

3192
02:07:26,610 --> 02:07:31,710
For if any of the stats result in death, pay special attention to the appropriate level of alcohol.

3193
02:07:31,970 --> 02:07:35,870
As its absence leads to a constantly worsening health.

3194
02:07:43,670 --> 02:07:45,790
Oh my god!

3195
02:07:48,970 --> 02:07:49,770
Okay.

3196
02:07:51,250 --> 02:07:52,050
Okay.

3197
02:07:52,110 --> 02:07:53,370
I guess...

3198
02:07:54,390 --> 02:07:56,410
It's time to buy some...

3199
02:07:56,410 --> 02:07:57,670
What the fuck is Spratz?

3200
02:07:58,090 --> 02:07:59,770
I'll buy Spratz then.

3201
02:08:00,030 --> 02:08:01,990
We don't need lights, we just need alcohol.

3202
02:08:02,510 --> 02:08:04,010
Okay, milk, banana.

3203
02:08:05,750 --> 02:08:06,190
Uh...

3204
02:08:08,010 --> 02:08:09,310
Okay, we'll have...

3205
02:08:09,310 --> 02:08:11,350
And then we'll also buy bread.

3206
02:08:11,710 --> 02:08:12,850
Oh, we'll buy rye bread.

3207
02:08:12,990 --> 02:08:13,230
Alright.

3208
02:08:13,750 --> 02:08:14,890
Okay, we have food.

3209
02:08:17,170 --> 02:08:18,050
Eating time.

3210
02:08:20,550 --> 02:08:21,490
Alright, there we go.

3211
02:08:21,970 --> 02:08:22,770
Okay, it's time.

3212
02:08:22,830 --> 02:08:23,510
We got this.

3213
02:08:24,170 --> 02:08:26,470
I don't know what game I got us into, guys.

3214
02:08:26,810 --> 02:08:27,590
I don't know.

3215
02:08:27,630 --> 02:08:30,090
It says... It still has train related stuff.

3216
02:08:30,270 --> 02:08:30,710
So...

3217
02:08:32,130 --> 02:08:33,790
Press I to open more...

3218
02:08:34,010 --> 02:08:35,810
Oh my god, that's a lot of inventory.

3219
02:08:36,570 --> 02:08:38,150
Go to your locomotive.

3220
02:08:38,330 --> 02:08:39,810
Alright, it's time to head to my train.

3221
02:08:40,750 --> 02:08:42,210
We'll head to my train now.

3222
02:08:42,390 --> 02:08:43,390
My train is so far!

3223
02:08:44,530 --> 02:08:46,250
Why is my train so far?

3224
02:08:48,350 --> 02:08:51,370
What the... Oh, I have to go up the stairs to get to my train.

3225
02:08:52,850 --> 02:08:53,270
Okay.

3226
02:08:53,270 --> 02:08:55,050
Guys, we're all here for the train part.

3227
02:09:00,110 --> 02:09:02,530
We're just here for the train part, guys.

3228
02:09:03,550 --> 02:09:04,070
Alright.

3229
02:09:04,530 --> 02:09:05,050
Hypothermia?

3230
02:09:05,590 --> 02:09:06,490
What's the temperature?

3231
02:09:06,870 --> 02:09:08,770
Oh shit, minus 29 degrees.

3232
02:09:09,130 --> 02:09:09,870
Oh, that is cold.

3233
02:09:10,770 --> 02:09:12,610
God damn, Siberia is cold.

3234
02:09:12,870 --> 02:09:13,610
Holy fuck.

3235
02:09:14,110 --> 02:09:15,070
Alright, here we go.

3236
02:09:17,290 --> 02:09:17,810
Alright.

3237
02:09:18,130 --> 02:09:19,910
I wish I could run faster though.

3238
02:09:20,090 --> 02:09:22,090
Because all I wanted to do was drive my train.

3239
02:09:22,590 --> 02:09:23,230
That's all.

3240
02:09:24,070 --> 02:09:25,870
That's all I wanted to do.

3241
02:09:28,570 --> 02:09:31,690
At first, you just enter the locomotive door.

3242
02:09:31,990 --> 02:09:32,510
At first, you just enter the locomotive door.

3243
02:09:32,530 --> 02:09:32,950
Oh, okay.

3244
02:09:37,150 --> 02:09:38,530
Wait, they're speaking Russian.

3245
02:09:40,190 --> 02:09:40,590
Oh.

3246
02:09:42,190 --> 02:09:42,890
Headlight frame.

3247
02:09:43,630 --> 02:09:44,030
Small.

3248
02:09:44,370 --> 02:09:45,590
Bro, I don't need any of this.

3249
02:09:47,530 --> 02:09:48,870
I'm here to get on my train.

3250
02:09:51,930 --> 02:09:53,010
Okay, I opened it.

3251
02:09:53,430 --> 02:09:54,250
How do I...

3252
02:09:54,670 --> 02:09:56,470
Guys, how do I get on my train, guys?

3253
02:09:56,930 --> 02:09:57,330
Guys.

3254
02:09:57,490 --> 02:09:58,510
Oh, okay, there we go.

3255
02:09:59,150 --> 02:09:59,550
Nice.

3256
02:09:59,810 --> 02:10:00,190
Alright.

3257
02:10:00,450 --> 02:10:02,050
Oh, and these are like the train...

3258
02:10:02,650 --> 02:10:03,230
parts.

3259
02:10:03,530 --> 02:10:04,270
And everything.

3260
02:10:04,870 --> 02:10:07,530
Oh my god, I can actually look behind me.

3261
02:10:08,210 --> 02:10:08,790
Alright.

3262
02:10:10,810 --> 02:10:12,830
Battery, current, oh, there we go.

3263
02:10:12,890 --> 02:10:14,170
I learned all of this.

3264
02:10:16,650 --> 02:10:18,490
Guys, I learned all of this.

3265
02:10:19,290 --> 02:10:20,770
The main handle.

3266
02:10:21,510 --> 02:10:22,990
We move this.

3267
02:10:24,230 --> 02:10:26,670
Wait, stand by the side mirror and press E.

3268
02:10:27,370 --> 02:10:31,410
Your inspection mode improves the function of the status...

3269
02:10:31,410 --> 02:10:32,530
of the train.

3270
02:10:32,850 --> 02:10:33,390
Navigate...

3271
02:10:33,390 --> 02:10:35,410
Oh, I have to make sure the train is okay?

3272
02:10:36,150 --> 02:10:37,370
What the fuck?

3273
02:10:38,370 --> 02:10:40,290
Train simulator didn't teach me this.

3274
02:10:40,490 --> 02:10:42,770
How am I supposed to know if my train's okay?

3275
02:10:49,570 --> 02:10:51,650
Oh shit, okay, okay.

3276
02:10:51,850 --> 02:10:52,390
Guys!

3277
02:10:52,670 --> 02:10:54,250
I thought I was ready!

3278
02:10:56,570 --> 02:10:58,970
What did train simulator teach me?

3279
02:11:01,410 --> 02:11:02,990
I think it looks okay.

3280
02:11:03,190 --> 02:11:05,370
Locate the broken part...

3281
02:11:06,550 --> 02:11:09,890
and add the adjustable wrench to my inventory.

3282
02:11:10,410 --> 02:11:12,710
Oh, there's a broken part here.

3283
02:11:13,550 --> 02:11:14,610
What is this?

3284
02:11:14,670 --> 02:11:15,430
Is this a mirror?

3285
02:11:15,550 --> 02:11:16,530
Oh, it's a speedometer.

3286
02:11:17,030 --> 02:11:18,650
Bro, what the fuck?

3287
02:11:19,810 --> 02:11:23,310
Okay, I have to fucking grab the speedometer apparently.

3288
02:11:24,330 --> 02:11:26,330
I need to fix the speedometer.

3289
02:11:26,890 --> 02:11:27,490
Alright.

3290
02:11:29,070 --> 02:11:29,670
Okay.

3291
02:11:29,850 --> 02:11:31,010
Is that for free?

3292
02:11:31,950 --> 02:11:36,010
Do you understand locomotive operation switching procedures and signal meanings?

3293
02:11:36,630 --> 02:11:37,310
Yeah.

3294
02:11:38,450 --> 02:11:39,130
Joe!

3295
02:11:39,410 --> 02:11:41,270
Thank you for the super chat.

3296
02:11:41,350 --> 02:11:42,190
Thank you.

3297
02:11:42,470 --> 02:11:43,150
Yeah.

3298
02:11:43,710 --> 02:11:46,710
And screw the screws of the speed...

3299
02:11:46,710 --> 02:11:47,430
What?

3300
02:11:48,570 --> 02:11:51,150
Why did train simulator teach me any of this?

3301
02:11:51,650 --> 02:11:54,670
I just know how to press like two buttons.

3302
02:11:56,910 --> 02:11:58,250
Sometimes three.

3303
02:11:58,870 --> 02:12:00,230
Put away...

3304
02:12:00,230 --> 02:12:00,990
Sometimes three.

3305
02:12:00,990 --> 02:12:03,530
If I feel like adventurous, you know?

3306
02:12:03,690 --> 02:12:05,850
My god, I'm also an engineer?

3307
02:12:09,930 --> 02:12:10,570
Okay.

3308
02:12:12,570 --> 02:12:15,750
Put a new speedometer in the empty space.

3309
02:12:16,170 --> 02:12:18,510
You can hold the right mouse to move.

3310
02:12:18,810 --> 02:12:20,750
I have a new speedometer?

3311
02:12:21,550 --> 02:12:23,530
Where the fuck is my speedometer?

3312
02:12:23,830 --> 02:12:25,670
I'm also a handyman?

3313
02:12:26,790 --> 02:12:28,110
Oh, it's over there.

3314
02:12:28,510 --> 02:12:29,150
I'm watching.

3315
02:12:29,330 --> 02:12:30,670
Thank you for the super chat.

3316
02:12:30,770 --> 02:12:31,210
Thank you.

3317
02:12:31,210 --> 02:12:31,930
Thank you.

3318
02:12:34,130 --> 02:12:35,910
Bro, it's 60 dollars?

3319
02:12:35,990 --> 02:12:38,230
The mafia is gonna fucking kill me.

3320
02:12:39,050 --> 02:12:41,310
And I'm still trying to repair my train.

3321
02:12:41,930 --> 02:12:43,530
I thought I was ready.

3322
02:12:44,590 --> 02:12:48,030
I thought the fucking train simulator prepared me for this.

3323
02:12:49,450 --> 02:12:51,710
I know I had to do all of this shit.

3324
02:12:52,790 --> 02:12:54,370
Okay, we don't need banana.

3325
02:12:54,550 --> 02:12:55,270
We need.

3326
02:12:55,570 --> 02:12:56,110
Okay.

3327
02:12:57,630 --> 02:12:58,170
Boom.

3328
02:13:01,210 --> 02:13:03,570
And then... tighten the screws up.

3329
02:13:05,070 --> 02:13:05,630
Alright.

3330
02:13:06,170 --> 02:13:07,070
Here we go.

3331
02:13:07,150 --> 02:13:08,710
We're tightening the screws up.

3332
02:13:12,130 --> 02:13:12,690
Alright.

3333
02:13:14,790 --> 02:13:17,150
You can sell used parts at the courtyard.

3334
02:13:17,510 --> 02:13:19,770
Remember to inspect conditions and replace them.

3335
02:13:20,210 --> 02:13:22,210
Oh, we can finally start the train!

3336
02:13:23,330 --> 02:13:23,890
Alright.

3337
02:13:25,390 --> 02:13:29,730
Turn on a small compressor switch in the engine room in the second section of the...

3338
02:13:29,730 --> 02:13:30,790
A small what?

3339
02:13:30,990 --> 02:13:31,530
What?

3340
02:13:35,240 --> 02:13:36,500
I don't wanna get...

3341
02:13:36,500 --> 02:13:42,300
I need a crew for this.

3342
02:13:44,960 --> 02:13:46,520
What do you mean?

3343
02:13:46,700 --> 02:13:49,440
A small... I have to go to another cabin?

3344
02:13:50,300 --> 02:13:50,940
Okay.

3345
02:13:51,440 --> 02:13:53,980
A small engine room switch.

3346
02:13:54,520 --> 02:13:55,160
Okay.

3347
02:13:55,620 --> 02:13:59,140
Guys, this is more of a train simulator than a train simulator.

3348
02:14:07,240 --> 02:14:10,640
Because I'm actually doing something on this train.

3349
02:14:16,680 --> 02:14:17,820
I'm so pumped.

3350
02:14:17,860 --> 02:14:20,280
Just a one-man train conductor.

3351
02:14:21,620 --> 02:14:23,740
Where do you find... I'm just so good!

3352
02:14:27,820 --> 02:14:32,500
Compress air essentially for safety, banking efficiency, and overall locomotive performance.

3353
02:14:33,020 --> 02:14:34,980
The small compressor provides...

3354
02:14:35,600 --> 02:14:36,160
Pressure...

3355
02:14:37,260 --> 02:14:39,320
Bro, simply repair an entire train.

3356
02:14:39,400 --> 02:14:40,520
It's so easy, bro.

3357
02:14:40,900 --> 02:14:42,980
Rusty Corn, thank you for the super chat.

3358
02:14:43,140 --> 02:14:44,040
Thank you, thank you.

3359
02:14:44,700 --> 02:14:53,500
A pantograph is an apparatus mounted on a roof of an electric locomotive to collect power through contacts with...

3360
02:14:53,500 --> 02:14:56,120
Oh my god, I'm actually learning what these things are!

3361
02:14:56,460 --> 02:14:57,760
That thing up top?

3362
02:14:58,040 --> 02:14:59,740
That's called a pantograph.

3363
02:15:00,320 --> 02:15:01,700
I'm learning, guys.

3364
02:15:03,240 --> 02:15:04,960
Turn on the pantographs, please.

3365
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:05,840
Power switch on the...

3366
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:07,620
Oh my god!

3367
02:15:08,280 --> 02:15:09,180
Okay.

3368
02:15:10,900 --> 02:15:12,320
Window heating.

3369
02:15:12,440 --> 02:15:13,500
I need heat.

3370
02:15:13,780 --> 02:15:14,400
Okay.

3371
02:15:14,600 --> 02:15:15,860
Field generator.

3372
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:17,900
Compressor.

3373
02:15:18,570 --> 02:15:19,800
Engine cooling.

3374
02:15:20,870 --> 02:15:21,800
High speed.

3375
02:15:23,960 --> 02:15:25,340

3376
02:15:25,480 --> 02:15:26,800
Pentagram 2.

3377
02:15:27,220 --> 02:15:27,860
Power.

3378
02:15:28,840 --> 02:15:29,740
KVC.

3379
02:15:29,940 --> 02:15:31,340
Oh my god!

3380
02:15:35,360 --> 02:15:37,360
Okay, we got that.

3381
02:15:37,640 --> 02:15:39,180
There's more buttons!

3382
02:15:39,640 --> 02:15:40,500
Okay, okay.

3383
02:15:40,640 --> 02:15:41,400
Electricity.

3384
02:15:41,800 --> 02:15:43,580
The red light shows...

3385
02:15:43,580 --> 02:15:44,880
The electricity.

3386
02:15:45,060 --> 02:15:47,360
Turn on pantograph 1 and 2.

3387
02:15:48,020 --> 02:15:48,780
Okay.

3388
02:15:49,580 --> 02:15:50,340
Nice.

3389
02:15:50,620 --> 02:15:51,620

3391
02:15:54,060 --> 02:15:54,620
Okay.

3392
02:15:54,700 --> 02:15:57,920
Turn on the heating first set and heating second set.

3393
02:15:58,200 --> 02:16:00,820
There's more buttons to the side?!

3394
02:16:00,820 --> 02:16:01,580
Okay.

3395
02:16:02,200 --> 02:16:02,960

3398
02:16:04,460 --> 02:16:04,960
Brake.

3399
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:05,500
Heating.

3400
02:16:05,680 --> 02:16:06,740

3401
02:16:07,060 --> 02:16:07,880

3402
02:16:08,060 --> 02:16:08,340

3405
02:16:10,760 --> 02:16:14,620
What the fuck is measuring apparatus illumination?

3406
02:16:14,820 --> 02:16:15,600
Oh, okay.

3407
02:16:15,700 --> 02:16:17,880
Lights on the dials.

3408
02:16:17,880 --> 02:16:18,140

02:16:24,060 --> 02:16:25,240
What the fuck do I need a...

3416
02:16:25,240 --> 02:16:26,560
What do I need a vent for?

3417
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:30,000
What is this?

3418
02:16:30,920 --> 02:16:31,880
What are...

3419
02:16:31,880 --> 02:16:33,020
There's a manual?

3420
02:16:33,020 --> 02:16:34,380
You will Buy...

3421
02:16:34,380 --> 02:16:36,060
Oh my god...

3422
02:16:58,150 --> 02:16:59,810
There's so much.

3423
02:16:59,910 --> 02:17:01,870
There's so much!

3424
02:17:02,790 --> 02:17:04,550
Oh my god...

3425
02:17:04,550 --> 02:17:07,310
Welcome to the tomato farm!

3426
02:17:08,050 --> 02:17:09,110
Welcome, welcome!

3427
02:17:10,610 --> 02:17:12,810
What is that just saw going?

3428
02:17:13,250 --> 02:17:13,790
Bear!

3429
02:17:14,250 --> 02:17:15,390
What do you mean?

3430
02:17:15,510 --> 02:17:18,470
This is more of a fucking train simulator!

3431
02:17:19,530 --> 02:17:20,090
Okay.

3432
02:17:22,990 --> 02:17:23,550
Alright.

3433
02:17:23,550 --> 02:17:26,010
Alright, keep the doors and windows closed.

3434
02:17:27,050 --> 02:17:27,610
Okay.

3435
02:17:27,670 --> 02:17:28,950
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

3437
02:17:30,110 --> 02:17:31,390
Oh, I need to close the door!

3438
02:17:31,490 --> 02:17:32,230
I need to close the door!

3439
02:17:32,230 --> 02:17:34,230
No, I'm letting the heat out!

3440
02:17:36,930 --> 02:17:38,030
Close the door!

3441
02:17:39,150 --> 02:17:39,730
Ugh.

3442
02:17:39,730 --> 02:17:40,310
Okay.

3443
02:17:40,890 --> 02:17:43,710
I gotta make sure I keep the heat in!

3444
02:17:46,550 --> 02:17:47,690
Oh my god.

3445
02:17:47,910 --> 02:17:50,390
This is what train simulator taught me.

3446
02:17:50,830 --> 02:17:51,410
Nice.

3447
02:17:51,410 --> 02:17:52,730
Alright, turn on the radio.

3448
02:17:52,950 --> 02:17:53,770
Is this the radio?

3449
02:17:54,370 --> 02:17:55,910
At least I have the radio.

3450
02:17:58,710 --> 02:17:59,290
Alright.

3451
02:18:00,540 --> 02:18:02,710
Can we go on the train now?

3452
02:18:05,050 --> 02:18:05,650
Alright.

3453
02:18:07,070 --> 02:18:09,350
This was information for your care...

3454
02:18:09,350 --> 02:18:11,330
You press the call button to listen.

3455
02:18:11,510 --> 02:18:11,710
Okay.

3456
02:18:12,070 --> 02:18:12,550
Hello?

3457
02:18:20,910 --> 02:18:21,510
Alright.

3458
02:18:22,310 --> 02:18:23,190
Now what?

3459
02:18:25,770 --> 02:18:26,610
Now what?

3460
02:18:28,370 --> 02:18:32,130
Okay, next step is to turn... My engine's not on yet?!

3461
02:18:33,690 --> 02:18:34,510
Where you at?

3462
02:18:34,690 --> 02:18:35,910
My engine's not on!

3463
02:18:36,670 --> 02:18:37,890
Oh, the compressor.

3464
02:18:38,130 --> 02:18:38,730
Okay.

3465
02:18:39,150 --> 02:18:39,750
Compressor.

3466
02:18:39,750 --> 02:18:40,010
Compressor switch.

3467
02:18:40,370 --> 02:18:40,930
Alright.

3468
02:18:42,950 --> 02:18:43,510
Nice.

3469
02:18:44,570 --> 02:18:45,870
We're turning it on!

3470
02:18:47,290 --> 02:18:47,850
Okay.

3471
02:18:48,830 --> 02:18:51,610
And then... that starts the controller for the...

3472
02:18:51,610 --> 02:18:52,390
Oh my god.

3473
02:18:53,910 --> 02:18:56,430
The KVC needs to be reset?

3474
02:18:56,690 --> 02:18:57,570
How do I...

3475
02:18:57,570 --> 02:18:58,490
Oh, here.

3476
02:18:59,470 --> 02:19:00,030
Alright.

3477
02:19:02,370 --> 02:19:03,770
Okay, it means it's working.

3478
02:19:03,850 --> 02:19:04,330
That's good.

3479
02:19:04,410 --> 02:19:05,830
Turn on the BV1.

3480
02:19:06,590 --> 02:19:07,470
Oh god.

3481
02:19:07,550 --> 02:19:08,810
Okay, I turn it on.

3482
02:19:11,750 --> 02:19:12,270
Okay.

3483
02:19:12,530 --> 02:19:12,550
Okay.

3484
02:19:12,790 --> 02:19:13,310
Alright.

3485
02:19:13,450 --> 02:19:15,030
And then... BVS.

3486
02:19:15,130 --> 02:19:15,870
What did I do?

3487
02:19:15,970 --> 02:19:16,590
I don't know.

3488
02:19:16,710 --> 02:19:17,890
What the fuck is this?

3489
02:19:20,770 --> 02:19:25,950
And the red light in the second row means that the engines are turned off.

3490
02:19:26,050 --> 02:19:28,350
We lower them and then raise them up.

3491
02:19:28,410 --> 02:19:29,390
Remember we set the...

3492
02:19:29,390 --> 02:19:31,830
I am not gonna remember any of this!

3493
02:19:32,910 --> 02:19:34,090
Oh my god!

3494
02:19:36,230 --> 02:19:37,690
The turn on the...

3495
02:19:37,690 --> 02:19:40,950
Guys, I found another game for train simulator enthusiasts, guys.

3496
02:19:41,350 --> 02:19:43,630
And I just wanted to shoot a gun.

3497
02:19:47,350 --> 02:19:50,470
It's located above the entrance in the cabin?

3498
02:19:52,070 --> 02:19:52,630
What?

3499
02:19:52,870 --> 02:19:53,810
Oh, it's up here.

3500
02:19:55,570 --> 02:19:56,450
Where is it?

3501
02:19:56,710 --> 02:19:57,790
What is this?

3502
02:19:58,410 --> 02:20:00,150
Turn on the VO2.

3503
02:20:00,370 --> 02:20:02,990
Activate the locomotive control system?

3504
02:20:04,030 --> 02:20:05,110
Holy shit.

3505
02:20:05,630 --> 02:20:06,190
What?

3506
02:20:07,690 --> 02:20:08,890
Is this all the buttons?

3507
02:20:09,130 --> 02:20:11,050
Guys, I am not gonna remember this, guys.

3508
02:20:12,510 --> 02:20:12,910
Guys!

3509
02:20:15,530 --> 02:20:17,230
Well, turning on the VU.

3510
02:20:17,430 --> 02:20:18,650
This is the VU, right?

3511
02:20:18,810 --> 02:20:20,390
Okay, we always need to turn this on.

3512
02:20:20,730 --> 02:20:23,430
Turn on the specialization system.

3513
02:20:23,830 --> 02:20:26,070
Go to the engine room in the...

3514
02:20:26,070 --> 02:20:26,350
Oh, okay.

3515
02:20:26,430 --> 02:20:27,190
The engine room is here.

3516
02:20:27,690 --> 02:20:28,090
Okay.

3517
02:20:30,510 --> 02:20:30,910
Okay.

3518
02:20:31,450 --> 02:20:31,850
Yeah.

3519
02:20:32,930 --> 02:20:34,530
How do I turn it to the forward?

3520
02:20:35,710 --> 02:20:36,610
How do I...

3521
02:20:37,530 --> 02:20:38,590
How do I do that?

3522
02:20:40,430 --> 02:20:41,550
How do I do that?

3523
02:20:41,750 --> 02:20:42,650
My arms!

3524
02:20:42,950 --> 02:20:43,370
Oh!

3525
02:20:45,230 --> 02:20:46,110
Oh, there it is.

3526
02:20:48,330 --> 02:20:49,790
No, that's not what I do.

3527
02:20:50,170 --> 02:20:50,590
Okay.

3528
02:20:51,310 --> 02:20:51,730
Guys.

3529
02:20:53,450 --> 02:20:54,690
Guys, I can't turn it.

3530
02:20:54,870 --> 02:20:55,450
Oh, there.

3531
02:20:55,870 --> 02:20:56,290
Wait.

3532
02:20:57,050 --> 02:20:57,930
How do I do that?

3533
02:20:59,210 --> 02:20:59,630
Guys.

3534
02:21:00,090 --> 02:21:01,290
Guys, my biggest issue.

3535
02:21:01,330 --> 02:21:02,310
I can't turn this.

3536
02:21:02,510 --> 02:21:03,350
I can't.

3537
02:21:03,450 --> 02:21:04,510
I can't.

3538
02:21:07,350 --> 02:21:08,270
Oh, there we go.

3539
02:21:08,450 --> 02:21:09,190
Oh, okay.

3540
02:21:09,350 --> 02:21:10,590
Nope, I went the wrong way.

3541
02:21:10,650 --> 02:21:11,290
That's not it.

3542
02:21:11,630 --> 02:21:12,070
Okay.

3543
02:21:12,690 --> 02:21:13,570
Go forward.

3544
02:21:15,370 --> 02:21:15,810
Forward!

3545
02:21:16,990 --> 02:21:17,430
Forward!

3546
02:21:17,650 --> 02:21:17,990
Oh, there.

3547
02:21:18,070 --> 02:21:18,410
I did it.

3548
02:21:19,570 --> 02:21:20,610
There, I did it.

3549
02:21:20,770 --> 02:21:21,210
Nice.

3550
02:21:21,650 --> 02:21:24,390
On the left in the first section.

3551
02:21:25,330 --> 02:21:25,770
Okay.

3552
02:21:25,850 --> 02:21:28,550
And then turn on the attention control.

3553
02:21:29,150 --> 02:21:30,510
Are we going yet?

3554
02:21:33,290 --> 02:21:33,730
Sun.

3555
02:21:34,050 --> 02:21:34,490
Sun.

3556
02:21:34,510 --> 02:21:35,070
Okay.

3557
02:21:35,170 --> 02:21:35,810
Close attention.

3558
02:21:37,710 --> 02:21:38,750
But to...

3559
02:21:38,750 --> 02:21:39,210
But...

3560
02:21:39,210 --> 02:21:39,370
Oh!

3561
02:21:41,570 --> 02:21:42,850
Oh, that's the attention!

3562
02:21:45,490 --> 02:21:46,350
That's it is!

3563
02:21:46,470 --> 02:21:47,730
That's the attention button!

3564
02:21:48,370 --> 02:21:51,990
Green light means that the movement is allowed up to 60.

3565
02:21:52,090 --> 02:21:53,050
I need alcohol.

3566
02:21:53,130 --> 02:21:54,130
I need a fucking...

3567
02:21:54,130 --> 02:21:54,710
I need vodka.

3568
02:21:55,290 --> 02:21:57,650
This Russian needs vodka right now.

3569
02:21:58,130 --> 02:21:58,810
All right.

3570
02:21:59,530 --> 02:22:00,270
You know what it means?

3571
02:22:00,310 --> 02:22:01,930
I gotta slow down before...

3572
02:22:01,930 --> 02:22:02,930
I'm not gonna remember all of this.

3573
02:22:02,990 --> 02:22:04,110
We're just gonna head to the next destination.

3574
02:22:04,170 --> 02:22:04,490
Okay.

3575
02:22:04,510 --> 02:22:05,910
That's like my main goal.

3576
02:22:06,190 --> 02:22:08,330
The moment I get to a destination, I'm happy.

3577
02:22:08,770 --> 02:22:13,830
Like I'm literally like starving and like almost hungover right now.

3578
02:22:13,990 --> 02:22:16,130
And like I need water and everything.

3579
02:22:16,250 --> 02:22:17,670
And I'm still trying to figure this out.

3580
02:22:18,290 --> 02:22:22,130
White light means that the nearest rail signal has not been detected and you have to proceed.

3581
02:22:22,370 --> 02:22:25,010
Next step is to prepare the brake which is used.

3582
02:22:25,230 --> 02:22:28,570
You need to fill the air brake system of the locomotive.

3583
02:22:29,650 --> 02:22:31,670
The system utilizes...

3584
02:22:31,670 --> 02:22:32,810
So slowing down.

3585
02:22:32,910 --> 02:22:34,070
To brake a locomotive.

3586
02:22:34,070 --> 02:22:34,230
I'm gonna...

3587
02:22:34,230 --> 02:22:35,270
A different brake.

3588
02:22:35,410 --> 02:22:36,250
It will be discussed...

3589
02:22:36,250 --> 02:22:37,550
It will be discussed later?

3590
02:22:37,910 --> 02:22:39,710
What do you mean it will be discussed later?

3591
02:22:44,260 --> 02:22:46,480
Guys, this is not looking too good for Doki.

3592
02:22:50,360 --> 02:22:50,820
Yes.

3593
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:55,860
This is not looking too good.

3594
02:22:59,340 --> 02:23:00,360
Set the handle...

3595
02:23:00,360 --> 02:23:01,880
Main brake handle to release.

3596
02:23:02,780 --> 02:23:03,240
Okay.

3597
02:23:03,360 --> 02:23:05,180
I don't know if I can do all of that.

3598
02:23:05,220 --> 02:23:05,720
But okay.

3599
02:23:09,100 --> 02:23:11,560
I don't know what any of these mean.

3600
02:23:11,840 --> 02:23:12,500
But okay.

3601
02:23:14,260 --> 02:23:16,540
You can brake longer and harder.

3602
02:23:16,580 --> 02:23:16,900
Okay.

3603
02:23:17,060 --> 02:23:18,780
Position release and charge.

3604
02:23:19,360 --> 02:23:19,900
Okay.

3605
02:23:19,980 --> 02:23:22,640
Set the main brake handle to the service position.

3606
02:23:23,100 --> 02:23:23,680
There we go.

3607
02:23:24,160 --> 02:23:24,700
Alright.

3608
02:23:24,820 --> 02:23:25,540
There we go.

3609
02:23:28,360 --> 02:23:28,900
Okay.

3610
02:23:28,940 --> 02:23:29,500
There we go.

3611
02:23:29,620 --> 02:23:30,420
Reach the value.

3612
02:23:30,660 --> 02:23:31,540
Oh my god.

3613
02:23:32,400 --> 02:23:33,060
Oh my.

3614
02:23:33,140 --> 02:23:35,800
This should be like after you master train some of your...

3615
02:23:35,800 --> 02:23:36,100
You know, the train simulator.

3616
02:23:36,100 --> 02:23:37,060
You get to do this.

3617
02:23:37,360 --> 02:23:38,500
That should be like...

3618
02:23:38,500 --> 02:23:40,420
This is like the true test of your train knowledge.

3619
02:23:40,680 --> 02:23:46,060
Like you learn everything from the train simulator and then you go straight into Siberia.

3620
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:54,160
I'm just...

3621
02:23:54,160 --> 02:23:58,020
I bet all the train enthusiasts knows what I'm doing right now.

3622
02:23:58,380 --> 02:24:00,340
I think they know what I'm doing.

3623
02:24:00,420 --> 02:24:01,800
I don't know what I'm doing.

3624
02:24:02,260 --> 02:24:02,740
I don't know what I'm doing.

3625
02:24:03,060 --> 02:24:05,160
I don't know what I'm doing.

3626
02:24:05,160 --> 02:24:05,400
I don't know what I'm doing.

3627
02:24:07,960 --> 02:24:09,000
Oh my god.

3628
02:24:09,040 --> 02:24:09,860
I'm gonna f**king...

3629
02:24:09,860 --> 02:24:11,080
I'm gonna drink my milk.

3630
02:24:12,360 --> 02:24:13,960
I'm gonna drink my milk.

3631
02:24:15,640 --> 02:24:16,760
I'm too...

3632
02:24:16,760 --> 02:24:17,560
I'm sad.

3633
02:24:20,420 --> 02:24:21,380
I'm sad.

3634
02:24:21,480 --> 02:24:22,920
I need to drink my milk.

3635
02:24:24,140 --> 02:24:24,780
Alright.

3636
02:24:24,840 --> 02:24:25,140
Here we go.

3637
02:24:25,480 --> 02:24:26,120
Oh.

3638
02:24:26,140 --> 02:24:26,460
Service.

3639
02:24:26,800 --> 02:24:27,580
There we go.

3640
02:24:28,840 --> 02:24:29,760
We're still...

3641
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:31,420
They talking about the brake situation?

3642
02:24:32,680 --> 02:24:33,320
Oh.

3643
02:24:33,440 --> 02:24:34,080
Oh.

3644
02:24:34,740 --> 02:24:35,380
Oh.

3645
02:24:35,400 --> 02:24:36,520
Press F to continue.

3646
02:24:36,860 --> 02:24:37,220
Okay.

3647
02:24:37,300 --> 02:24:39,260
If you would like to send more pre...

3648
02:24:39,260 --> 02:24:39,500
Okay.

3649
02:24:39,620 --> 02:24:40,780
I don't care about if...

3650
02:24:40,780 --> 02:24:43,260
If our f**king train can't brake, it's fine.

3651
02:24:43,780 --> 02:24:45,100
Just make the train go.

3652
02:24:47,400 --> 02:24:48,720
Insert the second...

3653
02:24:48,720 --> 02:24:51,040
Go to the cabin in the second...

3654
02:24:51,040 --> 02:24:51,800
Oh my god.

3655
02:24:52,720 --> 02:24:53,720
Let me through.

3656
02:24:54,480 --> 02:24:56,520
I need to go to the second cabin.

3657
02:24:56,900 --> 02:24:59,880
I need to go to the second cabin.

3658
02:25:00,760 --> 02:25:03,680
Why do I need to go to the second cabin?

3659
02:25:03,880 --> 02:25:04,540
Oh my god.

3660
02:25:05,440 --> 02:25:06,400
Let me through.

3661
02:25:07,480 --> 02:25:07,960
Okay.

3662
02:25:09,040 --> 02:25:10,440
Is this the second cabin?

3663
02:25:12,040 --> 02:25:12,760
Oh no.

3664
02:25:12,940 --> 02:25:13,560
Here we go.

3665
02:25:13,840 --> 02:25:15,520
This has to be the second cabin.

3666
02:25:15,640 --> 02:25:15,940
Right?

3667
02:25:17,320 --> 02:25:18,160
Is this it?

3668
02:25:20,100 --> 02:25:20,580
Wait.

3669
02:25:20,680 --> 02:25:21,340
This is connected.

3670
02:25:22,100 --> 02:25:22,940
Wait a minute.

3671
02:25:23,060 --> 02:25:25,040
This was connected the entire time.

3672
02:25:25,380 --> 02:25:26,820
I didn't have to go outside.

3673
02:25:27,820 --> 02:25:28,800
Oh my god.

3674
02:25:28,840 --> 02:25:29,420
There's a...

3675
02:25:34,310 --> 02:25:34,790
There's me.

3676
02:25:34,790 --> 02:25:35,110
I'm so sad.

3677
02:25:35,230 --> 02:25:35,410
I'm so sad.

3678
02:25:36,710 --> 02:25:37,190
I'm so sad.

3679
02:25:37,190 --> 02:25:37,290
I'm so sad.

3680
02:25:37,290 --> 02:25:37,750
I'm so sad.

3681
02:25:37,750 --> 02:25:37,810
I'm so sad.

3682
02:25:37,830 --> 02:25:38,090
Okay.

3683
02:25:38,090 --> 02:25:38,690
There's more like this.

3684
02:25:39,570 --> 02:25:40,130
Okay.

3685
02:25:40,470 --> 02:25:40,990
All right.

3686
02:25:41,590 --> 02:25:43,370
There's the back side.

3687
02:25:44,470 --> 02:25:45,030
Okay.

3688
02:25:45,270 --> 02:25:46,670
It's at the handle.

3689
02:25:47,230 --> 02:25:53,030
Breaking out to handle breaking release position and deactivate it.

3690
02:25:53,150 --> 02:25:53,570
Is it not here?

3691
02:25:53,730 --> 02:25:54,410
Oh, there's a...

3692
02:25:54,410 --> 02:25:55,310
What is this?

3693
02:25:56,190 --> 02:25:57,950
I don't know what it is.

3694
02:26:00,590 --> 02:26:01,150
Okay.

3695
02:26:01,370 --> 02:26:02,410
Return to the...

3696
02:26:02,410 --> 02:26:02,610
Okay.

3697
02:26:02,690 --> 02:26:03,830
I can close this then.

3698
02:26:04,030 --> 02:26:04,690
All right.

3699
02:26:04,770 --> 02:26:07,810
Well, we figured out there's a second side to the cabin.

3700
02:26:07,810 --> 02:26:10,150
That this train was connected all the line.

3701
02:26:10,530 --> 02:26:12,430
I did not have to...

3702
02:26:14,530 --> 02:26:16,350
Oh, set the handle to blocking.

3703
02:26:16,510 --> 02:26:17,350
Oh my god, I have to go back.

3704
02:26:17,710 --> 02:26:18,730
Do I have to go back?

3705
02:26:19,710 --> 02:26:20,710
Where was it?

3706
02:26:23,530 --> 02:26:24,490
Set the...

3707
02:26:25,330 --> 02:26:27,510
Wait, blocking handle to handbrake.

3708
02:26:27,550 --> 02:26:28,150
Oh, I did!

3709
02:26:28,630 --> 02:26:29,710
Can I do that?

3710
02:26:30,130 --> 02:26:31,850
Or do I have to do it on the other side?

3711
02:26:32,210 --> 02:26:33,810
Oh, it's on the other side!

3712
02:26:33,850 --> 02:26:34,630
There's two sides.

3713
02:26:34,830 --> 02:26:36,030
I'm getting disoriented.

3714
02:26:36,030 --> 02:26:37,250
There's too many sides.

3715
02:26:37,810 --> 02:26:39,930
There's too many sides!

3716
02:26:40,530 --> 02:26:41,050
Okay, here.

3717
02:26:43,630 --> 02:26:51,730
Oh my god, there's too many.

3718
02:26:52,150 --> 02:26:54,530
I thought this was gonna be a shooting game.

3719
02:26:55,450 --> 02:26:59,190
Instead, I get more accurate train simulator.

3720
02:26:59,750 --> 02:27:02,530
Set the handler to M.

3721
02:27:03,850 --> 02:27:04,390
M.

3722
02:27:05,310 --> 02:27:05,850
Okay.

3723
02:27:06,430 --> 02:27:07,630
Is this the right M?

3724
02:27:07,730 --> 02:27:08,550
Oh, this is M.

3725
02:27:09,370 --> 02:27:09,510
M.

3726
02:27:09,530 --> 02:27:12,150
Set this to 1.

3727
02:27:13,070 --> 02:27:13,550
Okay.

3728
02:27:14,590 --> 02:27:15,410
There we go.

3729
02:27:17,950 --> 02:27:22,990
If you apply too much power, the white light on the right panel will appear and the wheel will not be able to...

3730
02:27:22,990 --> 02:27:23,790
You have to reduce the power.

3731
02:27:24,050 --> 02:27:26,890
Next step is to connect to the marked railway wagon.

3732
02:27:27,430 --> 02:27:30,390
Drive forward until you pass the correct railway switch.

3733
02:27:30,430 --> 02:27:31,430
Don't drive too fast.

3734
02:27:31,590 --> 02:27:33,170
You have to brake soon.

3735
02:27:34,310 --> 02:27:35,410
Okay, am I driving?

3736
02:27:36,250 --> 02:27:37,950
What if I just go a little faster?

3737
02:27:39,370 --> 02:27:40,190
There you go.

3738
02:27:41,470 --> 02:27:42,170
There you go.

3739
02:27:42,210 --> 02:27:43,070
Oh my god, I'm going!

3740
02:27:43,290 --> 02:27:44,330
I'm going forward!

3741
02:27:47,810 --> 02:27:49,330
Guys, I'm doing it!

3742
02:27:52,330 --> 02:27:53,850
We're doing it, guys!

3743
02:27:54,090 --> 02:27:56,110
Oh my god, we finally figured it out.

3744
02:27:58,810 --> 02:27:59,950
Oh my god, wait!

3745
02:28:00,030 --> 02:28:02,410
I can play a cassette player?

3746
02:28:03,350 --> 02:28:05,370
Oh my god, there's so many things.

3747
02:28:05,550 --> 02:28:07,150
Okay, we gotta put this...

3748
02:28:08,490 --> 02:28:08,930
to...

3749
02:28:09,750 --> 02:28:11,330
zero so we can...

3750
02:28:11,330 --> 02:28:12,790
Wait, it's so far.

3751
02:28:13,350 --> 02:28:13,950
We're in.

3752
02:28:14,970 --> 02:28:15,410
Okay.

3753
02:28:15,950 --> 02:28:17,150
Here I crank it.

3754
02:28:17,210 --> 02:28:17,870
No, we can't!

3755
02:28:18,090 --> 02:28:18,790
It won't let me!

3756
02:28:19,870 --> 02:28:21,470
It actually stops me!

3757
02:28:22,890 --> 02:28:23,330
Alright.

3758
02:28:24,270 --> 02:28:25,490
Where's the train button?

3759
02:28:25,650 --> 02:28:26,570
The whistle button?

3760
02:28:26,650 --> 02:28:28,450
There has to be a whistle button here, right?

3761
02:28:30,390 --> 02:28:31,370
Alright, don't worry.

3762
02:28:31,530 --> 02:28:32,910
Oh, we have to slow down now.

3763
02:28:33,590 --> 02:28:34,790
We have to slow down.

3764
02:28:37,910 --> 02:28:38,350
No!

3765
02:28:41,780 --> 02:28:42,500
Oh, god.

3766
02:28:42,520 --> 02:28:42,840
Oh, shit.

3767
02:28:42,900 --> 02:28:43,500
The door is open.

3768
02:28:43,640 --> 02:28:43,940
Whoops.

3769
02:28:44,320 --> 02:28:45,700
Guys, I fucked up, guys.

3770
02:28:46,800 --> 02:28:47,240
Guys.

3771
02:28:47,860 --> 02:28:49,340
We drove past it, guys.

3772
02:28:50,020 --> 02:28:51,020
Guys, I don't...

3773
02:28:51,020 --> 02:28:51,380
Guys.

3774
02:28:52,580 --> 02:28:53,020
Brake?

3775
02:28:53,660 --> 02:28:54,100
Guys.

3776
02:28:54,960 --> 02:28:56,420
Guys, we drove past it, guys.

3777
02:28:56,980 --> 02:28:58,500
Guys, we drove past it, guys.

3778
02:29:01,420 --> 02:29:01,860
Okay.

3779
02:29:02,320 --> 02:29:03,380
I have an idea.

3780
02:29:06,340 --> 02:29:07,220
Brake applied.

3781
02:29:08,180 --> 02:29:08,620
Locomotive.

3782
02:29:08,940 --> 02:29:10,220
Where's the locomotive?

3783
02:29:10,500 --> 02:29:11,480
Where is it?

3784
02:29:11,560 --> 02:29:12,920
I forgot which one it is.

3785
02:29:13,760 --> 02:29:15,160
Guys, we're so far.

3786
02:29:15,260 --> 02:29:16,100
There it is!

3787
02:29:18,620 --> 02:29:19,060
Alright.

3788
02:29:19,780 --> 02:29:20,700
We did it!

3789
02:29:22,860 --> 02:29:24,240
Wait for the train to stop.

3790
02:29:24,340 --> 02:29:25,180
And then, we go on reverse.

3791
02:29:25,700 --> 02:29:26,960
This is what it taught me!

3792
02:29:29,460 --> 02:29:29,900
Alright.

3793
02:29:30,020 --> 02:29:32,620
And then, wait for the train to stop.

3794
02:29:32,820 --> 02:29:34,080
Okay, the speedometer is going...

3795
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:35,500
I was set up for failure!

3796
02:29:37,220 --> 02:29:39,920
Go outside and change the railway road.

3797
02:29:40,100 --> 02:29:41,580
Are you fucking kidding me?

3798
02:29:41,600 --> 02:29:42,380
It's so far!

3799
02:29:43,960 --> 02:29:45,560
I drove...

3800
02:29:47,860 --> 02:29:48,660
Noooooooooooo!

3801
02:29:50,220 --> 02:29:52,580
It's even further!

3802
02:29:55,940 --> 02:29:56,740
No!

3803
02:29:57,300 --> 02:29:59,140
It's taking me a while!

3804
02:30:04,720 --> 02:30:07,200
I drove too far!

3805
02:30:12,180 --> 02:30:14,620
It's taking me a while!

3806
02:30:17,480 --> 02:30:18,340
I'm mad!

3807
02:30:18,780 --> 02:30:20,220
Oh, I can't punch you.

3808
02:30:20,300 --> 02:30:20,860
Never mind.

3809
02:30:23,080 --> 02:30:25,740
Wait, I can just reverse the train?

3810
02:30:26,180 --> 02:30:27,680
Oh my god, you guys are so smart.

3811
02:30:27,960 --> 02:30:29,120
Let me run back to the train.

3812
02:30:29,140 --> 02:30:29,620
Let me run back to my train.

3813
02:30:29,860 --> 02:30:32,440
Let me run back to the train.

3814
02:30:32,840 --> 02:30:35,220
I don't know!

3815
02:30:35,680 --> 02:30:40,340
The tutorial was like go outside and I'm a sheep.

3816
02:30:40,700 --> 02:30:42,520
So I was like, okay.

3817
02:30:42,920 --> 02:30:46,680
I'll go outside and run back to the train.

3818
02:30:51,320 --> 02:30:55,260
Wait, can I drive from here?

3819
02:30:57,880 --> 02:30:59,060
Oh my god.

3820
02:30:59,140 --> 02:30:59,800
Wait!

3821
02:31:01,400 --> 02:31:02,920
Everything changed!

3822
02:31:06,640 --> 02:31:08,640
Wait, it won't let me guys.

3823
02:31:11,040 --> 02:31:11,800
Guys!

3824
02:31:11,840 --> 02:31:19,400
Guys, I can't move any of the buttons because it wants me to run.

3825
02:31:19,860 --> 02:31:20,620
because it wants me to run.

3826
02:31:20,620 --> 02:31:20,760
because it wants me to run.

3827
02:31:22,440 --> 02:31:24,780
Guys, it's making me run.

3828
02:31:31,080 --> 02:31:31,560
No!

3829
02:31:36,690 --> 02:31:37,970
Wait, I don't have to?

3830
02:31:38,490 --> 02:31:39,330
Okay, wait.

3831
02:31:39,410 --> 02:31:40,370
Maybe I'm just stupid.

3832
02:31:40,630 --> 02:31:42,850
I just don't know enough about trains.

3833
02:31:43,210 --> 02:31:46,410
Oh, I have to do the brakes on the other side.

3834
02:31:47,110 --> 02:31:47,590
Oh, I have to do the brakes on the other side.

3835
02:31:47,590 --> 02:31:48,450
Okay, I got this.

3836
02:31:49,630 --> 02:31:53,350
Guys, my train, everything is like running out right now on my train.

3837
02:31:53,730 --> 02:31:54,630
But it's okay.

3838
02:31:55,510 --> 02:31:57,430
Alright, we gotta figure this out.

3839
02:31:57,650 --> 02:31:58,130
Guys.

3840
02:32:00,190 --> 02:32:00,670
Okay.

3841
02:32:02,650 --> 02:32:03,790
I don't...

3842
02:32:03,790 --> 02:32:05,390
What's this?

3843
02:32:08,370 --> 02:32:09,830
What was that?

3844
02:32:09,990 --> 02:32:10,610
Attention.

3845
02:32:14,610 --> 02:32:16,630
Guys, it's not letting me...

3846
02:32:16,630 --> 02:32:20,090
Guys, it's actually not letting me play the game.

3847
02:32:21,510 --> 02:32:22,250
Guys, it's not letting me play the game.

3848
02:32:22,250 --> 02:32:22,690
Guys, it's actually not letting me play the game.

3849
02:32:23,070 --> 02:32:25,450
Guys, it's actually not letting me play the game.

3850
02:32:25,470 --> 02:32:29,890
Guys, I can't move anything.

3851
02:32:30,170 --> 02:32:32,410
They want me to run back.

3852
02:32:32,410 --> 02:32:33,830
No!

3853
02:32:34,270 --> 02:32:36,770
I can't move anything.

3854
02:32:36,790 --> 02:32:39,470
It actually wants me to run back.

3855
02:32:40,930 --> 02:32:41,910
It actually wants me to run back.

3856
02:32:41,910 --> 02:32:41,930
No!

3857
02:32:44,510 --> 02:32:45,490
No!

3858
02:32:47,010 --> 02:32:47,990
Yay!

3859
02:32:50,670 --> 02:32:51,650
Whee!

3860
02:32:52,810 --> 02:32:53,790
Whee!

3861
02:32:54,140 --> 02:32:54,630
No!

3862
02:32:56,260 --> 02:32:57,650
Guys, I can't.

3863
02:32:57,650 --> 02:32:59,250
Guys, it doesn't matter.

3864
02:32:59,330 --> 02:33:00,410
I can't press anything.

3865
02:33:02,410 --> 02:33:02,930
It won't let me.

3866
02:33:04,110 --> 02:33:07,170
It won't let me press anything, guys.

3867
02:33:07,310 --> 02:33:10,050
I can't even fucking move the brake.

3868
02:33:11,590 --> 02:33:13,370
It won't let me.

3869
02:33:13,870 --> 02:33:14,590
It won't let me.

3870
02:33:15,090 --> 02:33:17,390
Guys, I think it does want me to walk back.

3871
02:33:18,390 --> 02:33:18,950
Guys, I think it does want me to walk back.

3872
02:33:21,050 --> 02:33:21,950
Actual punishment.

3873
02:33:22,390 --> 02:33:23,930
Guys, why didn't you stop me?

3874
02:33:25,270 --> 02:33:27,290
It's time for the walk of shame.

3875
02:33:28,050 --> 02:33:29,630
I can't believe it.

3876
02:33:29,930 --> 02:33:31,450
I should have bought a gun.

3877
02:33:32,410 --> 02:33:35,530
I should have bought a gun from the mafia's shop.

3878
02:33:41,190 --> 02:33:47,450
I got to enjoy about 30 seconds of actually driving the train.

3879
02:33:47,830 --> 02:33:50,510
And then they put me back onto the road.

3880
02:33:50,990 --> 02:33:53,170
And then they put me back onto the road.

3881
02:33:53,170 --> 02:33:54,770
They're making me do the run of shame.

3882
02:33:55,150 --> 02:33:55,590
They're making me do the run of shame.

3883
02:33:55,590 --> 02:33:57,090
The run of shame!

3884
02:33:57,730 --> 02:33:59,050
The run of shame!

3885
02:34:00,650 --> 02:34:04,990
I got the fuel what it's like to drive a train for 30 seconds.

3886
02:34:05,670 --> 02:34:07,470
And then I fucked up.

3887
02:34:07,630 --> 02:34:09,670
And now it's punishing me.

3888
02:34:10,230 --> 02:34:12,490
It's actually punishing me.

3889
02:34:12,530 --> 02:34:13,790
I can't believe it.

3890
02:34:13,930 --> 02:34:16,910
It won't let me drive the train backwards.

3891
02:34:17,550 --> 02:34:21,010
Train simulator let me drive the train backwards.

3892
02:34:22,790 --> 02:34:24,730
But now... Oh my god it's so fine.

3893
02:34:25,650 --> 02:34:27,850
It's actually so fine.

3894
02:34:31,590 --> 02:34:33,550
The price of failure.

3895
02:34:35,030 --> 02:34:36,410
Alright here you go.

3896
02:34:37,610 --> 02:34:39,850
Now back to the train I go.

3897
02:34:43,010 --> 02:34:43,310
Okay.

3898
02:34:43,710 --> 02:34:44,650
Here we go.

3899
02:34:45,090 --> 02:34:46,170
I overshot.

3900
02:34:46,190 --> 02:34:48,250
Yeah I sort of... I went too fast.

3901
02:34:48,710 --> 02:34:51,970
I was like hee hee I'm gonna put it to 6.

3902
02:34:53,030 --> 02:34:54,710
I'm gonna put the handle on.

3903
02:34:54,730 --> 02:34:56,250
I'm gonna put the handle to 6 and go fast.

3904
02:34:57,250 --> 02:34:58,010
Then...

3905
02:34:58,850 --> 02:35:02,830
Sometimes... Sometimes life is not about going fast chat.

3906
02:35:04,430 --> 02:35:07,090
Not in Siberia that's for sure.

3907
02:35:11,350 --> 02:35:13,470
Why is she outside?

3908
02:35:14,270 --> 02:35:16,170
I'm in Siberia.

3909
02:35:16,190 --> 02:35:18,830
I'm in the real train simulator now.

3910
02:35:19,430 --> 02:35:21,170
I thought I... I thought...

3911
02:35:21,530 --> 02:35:24,170
I learned a lot from train simulator.

3912
02:35:24,730 --> 02:35:27,370
I thought I was actually doing so well.

3913
02:35:27,730 --> 02:35:31,150
And like you know actually processing how to...

3914
02:35:31,150 --> 02:35:32,610
How to drive a train.

3915
02:35:33,010 --> 02:35:37,590
But I didn't realize there was more to trains than just 3 buttons.

3916
02:35:38,770 --> 02:35:41,090
There's so many more buttons.

3917
02:35:45,490 --> 02:35:48,590
There's so many buttons guys.

3918
02:35:52,080 --> 02:35:52,880
Alright.

3919
02:35:53,200 --> 02:35:55,180
We put... put that there.

3920
02:35:55,180 --> 02:35:56,820
And then...

3921
02:35:56,820 --> 02:35:58,340
Here we go.

3922
02:35:59,580 --> 02:36:00,180
Okay.

3923
02:36:01,200 --> 02:36:01,800
Reverse!

3924
02:36:04,240 --> 02:36:04,840
Alright.

3925
02:36:07,600 --> 02:36:09,380
Get that brake out of here.

3926
02:36:11,400 --> 02:36:12,260
There we go.

3927
02:36:12,340 --> 02:36:12,660
Release.

3928
02:36:14,680 --> 02:36:15,880
Oh okay okay.

3929
02:36:16,720 --> 02:36:17,640
It's 8.

3930
02:36:18,380 --> 02:36:18,980
Alright.

3931
02:36:19,220 --> 02:36:21,400
We finally hit it a little bit right?

3932
02:36:24,480 --> 02:36:25,580
Connect this slowly.

3933
02:36:25,760 --> 02:36:26,620
Do not exceed the...

3934
02:36:26,620 --> 02:36:28,580
You can observe the train in inspection mode.

3935
02:36:28,740 --> 02:36:29,960
What happens if we hit it?

3936
02:36:31,620 --> 02:36:33,080
Does it punish us for it?

3937
02:36:34,140 --> 02:36:35,300
We're gonna find out.

3938
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:41,760
We're gonna find out.

3939
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:48,640
No.

3940
02:36:48,640 --> 02:36:49,720
That'll be fine right?

3941
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:51,940
I mean it's 500 meters away.

3942
02:36:52,480 --> 02:36:53,780
Ooh it's getting faster.

3943
02:36:54,160 --> 02:36:56,140
Ooh now it's 400 guys.

3944
02:36:56,580 --> 02:36:58,620
Woah it's going so fast.

3945
02:36:59,320 --> 02:36:59,960
Woah!

3946
02:37:00,500 --> 02:37:02,600
Okay this is going way too fast.

3947
02:37:04,020 --> 02:37:05,000
Oh no!

3948
02:37:05,140 --> 02:37:05,720
Oh no!

3949
02:37:05,820 --> 02:37:06,440
Oh no!

3950
02:37:06,580 --> 02:37:07,240
Oh no!

3951
02:37:07,380 --> 02:37:08,040
Oh no!

3952
02:37:08,160 --> 02:37:08,400
Okay.

3953
02:37:08,400 --> 02:37:08,480
Okay!

3954
02:37:09,120 --> 02:37:09,520
Oh!

3955
02:37:10,700 --> 02:37:11,360
There we go!

3956
02:37:11,500 --> 02:37:12,320
There we go!

3957
02:37:12,400 --> 02:37:12,880
There we go!

3958
02:37:13,020 --> 02:37:13,660
There we go!

3959
02:37:13,700 --> 02:37:14,360
We should be fine!

3960
02:37:14,440 --> 02:37:15,200
We should be fine!

3961
02:37:15,500 --> 02:37:18,180
Okay, it's still going a little bit fast.

3962
02:37:18,500 --> 02:37:19,280
Okay, there we go.

3963
02:37:20,720 --> 02:37:21,120
Alright.

3964
02:37:21,120 --> 02:37:24,940
I wanna see the... See, now it's okay!

3965
02:37:25,040 --> 02:37:27,340
Now it's like an okay distance.

3966
02:37:29,820 --> 02:37:31,160
We should be able to connect this.

3967
02:37:33,120 --> 02:37:34,580
The game won't punish me, right?

3968
02:37:35,320 --> 02:37:35,720
No.

3969
02:37:36,560 --> 02:37:37,340
It would never!

3970
02:37:38,400 --> 02:37:40,420
Why would the game punish me?

3971
02:37:40,620 --> 02:37:41,320
See?

3972
02:37:41,640 --> 02:37:43,380
Look how slow we're going!

3973
02:37:45,020 --> 02:37:46,120
Look at that!

3974
02:38:01,760 --> 02:38:11,560
Oh my god!

3975
02:38:11,700 --> 02:38:13,280
What the f***?

3976
02:38:13,500 --> 02:38:15,420
That's how it ends?

3977
02:38:22,480 --> 02:38:23,000
No!

3978
02:38:23,300 --> 02:38:23,300
No!

3979
02:38:27,530 --> 02:38:29,990
Alright, if you guys want more, you can buy the game.

3980
02:38:31,410 --> 02:38:35,530
I think... I think I'm done with my train career, guys.

3981
02:38:36,410 --> 02:38:39,070
I think... I think I'm done.

3982
02:38:40,850 --> 02:38:42,270
I think I'm gonna retire.

3983
02:38:45,570 --> 02:38:47,470
I don't wanna load it.

3984
02:38:49,630 --> 02:38:51,950
I think I'm gonna retire here.

3985
02:38:51,950 --> 02:38:53,630
We had a good run.

3986
02:38:55,650 --> 02:38:59,210
We had a... My train career is over.

3987
02:38:59,390 --> 02:39:00,050
You can't...

3988
02:39:00,050 --> 02:39:02,330
You can't recover from that.

3989
02:39:05,850 --> 02:39:08,290
You can't recover from that.

3990
02:39:08,410 --> 02:39:09,210
I'm scared.

3991
02:39:09,470 --> 02:39:11,010
I'm scared people are gonna...

3992
02:39:11,010 --> 02:39:14,330
I'm scared people are gonna send me to the gulags.

3993
02:39:18,190 --> 02:39:19,690
I don't understand!

3994
02:39:20,470 --> 02:39:21,710
How is like...

3995
02:39:21,950 --> 02:39:23,430
Driving a plane...

3996
02:39:23,800 --> 02:39:25,670
Easier than driving a train.

3997
02:39:27,620 --> 02:39:30,290
Like... It's just backwards and forwards!

3998
02:39:31,640 --> 02:39:33,510
Why is there more buttons?

3999
02:39:34,030 --> 02:39:34,810
Why?

4000
02:39:37,700 --> 02:39:42,370
Why was there more buttons than a plane?

4001
02:39:43,580 --> 02:39:44,570
Oh my god!

4002
02:39:45,620 --> 02:39:46,310
You know what?

4003
02:39:46,470 --> 02:39:48,710
Best like... 15...

4004
02:39:48,710 --> 02:39:51,750
How much did I spend for that like 30 minutes of gameplay?

4005
02:39:51,950 --> 02:39:53,690
I played like 30 minutes of this...

4006
02:39:53,690 --> 02:39:55,410
Of the train Siberia.

4007
02:39:55,550 --> 02:39:57,210
How much did I pay for?

4008
02:39:57,290 --> 02:39:58,530
Okay, 20 Canadian dollars.

4009
02:39:58,630 --> 02:39:59,070
That's fine.

4010
02:39:59,350 --> 02:40:02,050
That was... That was a good 20 dollars to spend it on.

4011
02:40:03,510 --> 02:40:03,950
Um...

4012
02:40:04,410 --> 02:40:04,850

Thank you.

4016
02:40:07,110 --> 02:40:09,490
Two hours well spent.

4017
02:40:09,610 --> 02:40:11,530
Thank you for the super chat.

4018
02:40:11,630 --> 02:40:11,930

Thank you.

4023
02:40:14,730 --> 02:40:15,150
Thank you.

4024
02:40:15,150 --> 02:40:17,310
Train Simulator Classic is more of a default experience.

4025
02:40:17,550 --> 02:40:19,910
Train Sim World is more of the expand experience.

4026
02:40:20,150 --> 02:40:21,190
Similar to this.

4027
02:40:21,190 --> 02:40:21,750
Wait!

4028
02:40:21,890 --> 02:40:23,190
What's Train Sim World?

4029
02:40:27,130 --> 02:40:28,670
Train Sim World.

4030
02:40:29,970 --> 02:40:31,410
Train Sim World?

4031
02:40:31,590 --> 02:40:32,550
Can I like...

4032
02:40:33,350 --> 02:40:35,050
What's Train Sim World?

4033
02:40:35,290 --> 02:40:36,670
How much is Train Sim World?

4034
02:40:36,870 --> 02:40:37,730
Oh my god!

4035
02:40:37,750 --> 02:40:38,850
That's 51 dollars.

4036
02:40:45,720 --> 02:40:46,080
Wait!

4037
02:40:46,080 --> 02:40:51,440
What's the difference between Train Sim World and like... Train...

4038
02:40:51,980 --> 02:40:52,840
Uh...

4039
02:40:52,840 --> 02:40:54,960
Then like... Train Simulator?

4040
02:40:54,980 --> 02:40:55,460
Train Simulator!

4041
02:40:55,520 --> 02:40:56,160
Wait!

4042
02:40:56,240 --> 02:40:57,060
What's the difference?

4043
02:40:58,300 --> 02:40:58,940
Wait.

4044
02:40:59,020 --> 02:41:00,460
I need to see what the difference is.

4045
02:41:00,760 --> 02:41:02,060
There is more?!

4046
02:41:02,060 --> 02:41:03,780
There is more to the....

4047
02:41:03,780 --> 02:41:05,300
There is more Train Sims?

4048
02:41:06,020 --> 02:41:07,400
How much more?

4049
02:41:11,300 --> 02:41:14,780
Okay, Train Sim World, was it worth it...

4050
02:41:14,780 --> 02:41:16,420
Oh my god!

4051
02:41:18,660 --> 02:41:19,300
Wait!

4052
02:41:19,600 --> 02:41:20,580
Okay, guys.

4053
02:41:20,740 --> 02:41:21,640
Not over.

4054
02:41:21,800 --> 02:41:22,700
Stream's not over.

4055
02:41:22,900 --> 02:41:23,240
Guys.

4056
02:41:23,240 --> 02:41:25,840
Guys, guys, we're... Dream's not over, don't leave!

4057
02:41:32,360 --> 02:41:33,360
Dream's not over!

4058
02:41:33,760 --> 02:41:35,920
Okay, $51, that's alright.

4059
02:41:40,600 --> 02:41:42,620
Okay, let me continue payment.

4060
02:41:43,500 --> 02:41:45,680
Alright, don't worry, it's a business expense.

4061
02:41:46,540 --> 02:41:48,340
It's a business expense, guys.

4062
02:41:49,240 --> 02:41:51,160
Alright, how many gigabytes is this?

4063
02:41:51,160 --> 02:41:52,340
Okay, 29 gigabytes.

4064
02:41:52,660 --> 02:41:53,320
Okay, we're fine.

4065
02:41:53,400 --> 02:41:53,780
That's fine.

4066
02:41:53,860 --> 02:41:54,320
That's okay.

4067
02:41:54,580 --> 02:41:58,200
29 giga... the other one was also like 25...

4068
02:41:58,200 --> 02:42:00,620
25 gigabytes, so we're fine there.

4069
02:42:02,340 --> 02:42:03,940
The ride never ends!

4070
02:42:04,120 --> 02:42:05,380
It's time for another train!

4071
02:42:06,200 --> 02:42:07,280
Guys, don't leave!

4072
02:42:07,400 --> 02:42:09,280
We have more trains, guys!

4073
02:42:12,900 --> 02:42:14,040
There's more trains!

4074
02:42:14,140 --> 02:42:15,540
You thought it was over?

4075
02:42:15,980 --> 02:42:17,960
Alright, let me watch this review video.

4076
02:42:18,280 --> 02:42:19,680
If it was worth it.

4077
02:42:19,940 --> 02:42:20,800
I want...

4078
02:42:21,160 --> 02:42:23,420
This Doki is a wild ride.

4079
02:42:23,620 --> 02:42:25,940
Thank you for the super chat.

4080
02:42:25,980 --> 02:42:26,360
Thank you.

4081
02:42:26,380 --> 02:42:27,000
Thank you.

4082
02:42:27,020 --> 02:42:28,680
Thank you for the super chat.

4083
02:42:28,780 --> 02:42:29,080
Thank you.

4084
02:42:29,300 --> 02:42:29,680
Thank you.

4085
02:42:29,680 --> 02:42:30,980
Doki Train Funds.

4086
02:42:30,980 --> 02:42:31,960
Oh my god!

4087
02:42:32,020 --> 02:42:32,520
There's a...

4088
02:42:37,370 --> 02:42:37,910
Wait!

4089
02:42:38,870 --> 02:42:41,170
I should play this train simulator!

4090
02:42:41,790 --> 02:42:43,170
I can go back to...

4091
02:42:45,880 --> 02:42:47,120
in my simulator!

4092
02:42:49,960 --> 02:42:54,180
Yeah, I'm watching the review after the fact that I purchased.

4093
02:42:54,460 --> 02:42:55,780
I don't know what's going on.

4094
02:42:56,220 --> 02:42:57,940
Guys, I can go...

4095
02:42:58,120 --> 02:43:00,700
I can go visit the cabin!

4096
02:43:01,540 --> 02:43:03,260
Afterwards, mysteriously!

4097
02:43:03,540 --> 02:43:05,820
Thank you for the five gifted chips!

4098
02:43:06,160 --> 02:43:08,620
Guys, the ride's not over!

4099
02:43:08,800 --> 02:43:10,520
Get back into the train!

4100
02:43:15,180 --> 02:43:18,960
Guys, get back into the train!

4101
02:43:19,080 --> 02:43:22,280
Guys, the ride's not over!

4102
02:43:24,280 --> 02:43:28,750
We went to Siberia, and now we're getting back on the train!

4103
02:43:29,990 --> 02:43:31,050
I'm 10 gigabytes.

4104
02:43:31,250 --> 02:43:33,430
Don't worry, we have 10 more gigabytes left.

4105
02:43:33,610 --> 02:43:35,470
Get in the train, Dragoons!

4106
02:43:35,550 --> 02:43:37,090
Get in the fucking train!

4107
02:43:40,970 --> 02:43:42,090
Dragoons, I spent...

4108
02:43:42,090 --> 02:43:43,570
Today, I spent like...

4109
02:43:44,050 --> 02:43:46,690
at least $80 today on just trains.

4110
02:43:46,810 --> 02:43:51,130
Guys, we are gonna make sure this was worth it!

4111
02:43:53,730 --> 02:43:56,210
We are gonna stretch that out!

4112
02:43:56,230 --> 02:44:00,430
I spent $80 for this one stream for as long as I can!

4113
02:44:00,910 --> 02:44:03,390
Until I think it was worth the money!

4114
02:44:05,790 --> 02:44:08,690
We need to pay off our train debt!

4115
02:44:10,370 --> 02:44:11,310
AirPodNinja, thank you!

4116
02:44:11,330 --> 02:44:12,730
Thank you!

4117
02:44:12,790 --> 02:44:15,510
I went off of MissDoki's wild ride!

4118
02:44:15,950 --> 02:44:17,070
Guys, I'm on a...

4119
02:44:17,070 --> 02:44:23,770
I have a debt right now to the train mafia, so we gotta make sure we make enough money today.

4120
02:44:23,970 --> 02:44:24,450
And then...

4121
02:44:24,450 --> 02:44:29,450
to justify all these purchases, guys.

4122
02:44:31,950 --> 02:44:32,950
Please let...

4123
02:44:32,950 --> 02:44:33,070
No!

4124
02:44:34,010 --> 02:44:38,130
Nobody is getting off the train until the ride's over.

4125
02:44:38,310 --> 02:44:42,070
Until we played all the train sims games today.

4126
02:44:42,590 --> 02:44:47,810
Nobody is leaving this ride until all the train simulator games are over.

4127
02:44:48,050 --> 02:44:48,750
Chat.

4128
02:44:52,420 --> 02:44:54,380
Someone please pay her.

4129
02:45:00,580 --> 02:45:01,500
I'm waiting.

4130
02:45:02,420 --> 02:45:05,700
I am waiting, guys.

4131
02:45:07,780 --> 02:45:09,160
I'm just waiting, guys.

4132
02:45:09,380 --> 02:45:10,960
We are almost there, chat.

4133
02:45:11,160 --> 02:45:12,260
We're almost there.

4134
02:45:13,720 --> 02:45:14,800
It is...

4135
02:45:14,800 --> 02:45:15,600
It is...

4136
02:45:15,600 --> 02:45:18,520
27 more gigabytes left!

4137
02:45:18,880 --> 02:45:19,060
Woo!

4138
02:45:20,320 --> 02:45:21,780
Zechra, thank you for the super chat.

4139
02:45:21,880 --> 02:45:22,180
Thank you.

4140
02:45:22,220 --> 02:45:22,900
Thank you.

4141
02:45:22,940 --> 02:45:24,360
The Doki Express is now available for purchase.

4142
02:45:24,360 --> 02:45:25,860
It's been stopping for a while, squad.

4143
02:45:26,020 --> 02:45:26,840
Thank you for the super chat.

4144
02:45:26,900 --> 02:45:27,500
Thank you, thank you.

4145
02:45:27,580 --> 02:45:28,180
What is that?

4146
02:45:28,320 --> 02:45:29,300
That train movie?

4147
02:45:29,640 --> 02:45:34,920
Train movie where the world is in the train and if the train stops, you die?

4148
02:45:35,440 --> 02:45:35,920
Snowpiercer!

4149
02:45:36,400 --> 02:45:36,880
Yes!

4150
02:45:37,200 --> 02:45:38,940
We're just like Snowpiercer!

4151
02:45:39,480 --> 02:45:41,560
Guys, and that's a good thing.

4152
02:45:41,940 --> 02:45:43,440
I'm keeping you all alive.

4153
02:45:45,800 --> 02:45:46,280
Guys.

4154
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:50,260
Guys, I'm keeping you all alive in my Snowpiercer train.

4155
02:45:51,980 --> 02:45:53,200
Squad, thank you for the super chat.

4156
02:45:53,240 --> 02:45:53,900
Thank you, thank you.

4157
02:45:53,900 --> 02:45:54,460
I'm not leaving.

4158
02:45:54,580 --> 02:45:56,160
I'm just getting out to hit the track switch.

4159
02:45:56,340 --> 02:45:56,700
I swear.

4160
02:45:56,720 --> 02:45:56,920
No!

4161
02:45:57,300 --> 02:45:59,400
Nobody is getting out to hit the track switch.

4162
02:45:59,560 --> 02:46:02,580
Only I can hit the track switch, guys, because I know what I'm doing.

4163
02:46:02,760 --> 02:46:12,020
I went through a 30-minute tutorial in Russia on how to hit the track switch before I died.

4164
02:46:17,500 --> 02:46:19,240
Squad, thank you for the super chat.

4165
02:46:19,340 --> 02:46:20,220
Thank you, thank you.

4166
02:46:20,260 --> 02:46:21,580
This is the train derail.

4167
02:46:21,840 --> 02:46:26,860
Look, I said I'm the better version of the Snowpiercer and it's not going to derail.

4168
02:46:26,960 --> 02:46:27,680
It finished.

4169
02:46:27,880 --> 02:46:29,080
It finished installing.

4170
02:46:30,680 --> 02:46:36,140
We gotta thank that one guy who suggested the train sim world chat.

4171
02:46:36,420 --> 02:46:44,040
We have to thank him for introducing me to more train games chat.

4172
02:46:44,460 --> 02:46:47,200
I can't believe none of you guys suggested this.

4173
02:46:49,640 --> 02:46:51,200
What are you trying to hide?

4174
02:46:51,240 --> 02:46:53,880
Why are you trying to hide more train games?

4175
02:46:56,600 --> 02:46:57,080
Okay.

4176
02:46:57,700 --> 02:46:58,460
There we go.

4177
02:46:58,920 --> 02:46:59,600
Oh, shit.

4178
02:47:00,240 --> 02:47:01,160
Oh, my God.

4179
02:47:01,340 --> 02:47:04,380
What is this, like, thirst trap video of the train?

4180
02:47:06,560 --> 02:47:07,480
What is this?

4181
02:47:09,100 --> 02:47:09,880
What is this?

4182
02:47:09,900 --> 02:47:10,200
Whoa!

4183
02:47:11,320 --> 02:47:12,300
Oh, my God.

4184
02:47:12,380 --> 02:47:13,500
What a thirst trap.

4185
02:47:19,740 --> 02:47:20,460
Oh, my God.

4186
02:47:20,460 --> 02:47:21,820
These trains are so high-end.

4187
02:47:21,820 --> 02:47:22,120
They're like HD.

4188
02:47:23,120 --> 02:47:24,600
That's some HD train.

4189
02:47:31,050 --> 02:47:31,910
Oh, my God.

4190
02:47:31,970 --> 02:47:32,550
Look at the...

4191
02:47:32,550 --> 02:47:34,990
Oh, look at all these buttons I can press.

4192
02:47:35,470 --> 02:47:36,990
I wonder if I can call the phone.

4193
02:47:40,070 --> 02:47:41,610
That's a slick-ass train.

4194
02:47:44,070 --> 02:47:46,470
There is audio, but it's, like, super quiet.

4195
02:47:47,150 --> 02:47:54,030
Railroads are a dangerous place and you should never attempt to replicate or copy activities you see in-game on the real railroad.

4196
02:47:54,150 --> 02:47:54,910
I don't think, like...

4197
02:47:54,910 --> 02:47:58,990
Us regular people are allowed to, like, drop... steal a train.

4198
02:48:01,850 --> 02:48:05,490
I don't think we're gonna be allowed to be on that train anyway.

4199
02:48:05,970 --> 02:48:06,590
I have to...

4200
02:48:06,590 --> 02:48:06,890
Oh, no.

4201
02:48:06,970 --> 02:48:07,830
I don't wanna register it.

4202
02:48:07,910 --> 02:48:08,790
No thanks.

4203
02:48:09,730 --> 02:48:10,270
Uh...

4204
02:48:10,270 --> 02:48:11,150
No, thank you.

4205
02:48:11,610 --> 02:48:12,530
Character select.

4206
02:48:14,190 --> 02:48:15,890
I wanna be old.

4207
02:48:24,500 --> 02:48:25,040
Uh...

4208
02:48:25,700 --> 02:48:26,900
I have read...

4209
02:48:26,900 --> 02:48:27,980
Uh...

4210
02:48:27,980 --> 02:48:28,560
Oh, okay.

4211
02:48:28,640 --> 02:48:29,720
See real world advertisements?

4212
02:48:30,080 --> 02:48:30,300
Sure.

4213
02:48:30,700 --> 02:48:31,180
Alright.

4214
02:48:32,960 --> 02:48:33,680
Um...

4215
02:48:33,680 --> 02:48:35,440
Recommended bait...

4216
02:48:35,440 --> 02:48:36,800
Get started with training.

4217
02:48:37,960 --> 02:48:38,680
Uh...

4218
02:48:38,680 --> 02:48:40,460
Standard experience...

4219
02:48:40,460 --> 02:48:41,840
Jump to the main...

4220
02:48:41,840 --> 02:48:42,220
You know what?

4221
02:48:42,340 --> 02:48:43,720
We don't need the instructions!

4222
02:48:44,280 --> 02:48:45,760
We already have the...

4223
02:48:45,760 --> 02:48:46,520
Uh...

4224
02:48:46,520 --> 02:48:47,740
We already have the...

4225
02:48:47,740 --> 02:48:49,440
The original train simulator.

4226
02:48:50,200 --> 02:48:50,920
Okay.

4227
02:48:51,020 --> 02:48:51,860
Let's see.

4228
02:48:52,460 --> 02:48:53,180
Uh...

4229
02:48:53,180 --> 02:48:54,580
To the trains we go.

4230
02:48:55,080 --> 02:48:56,360
Pick a train.

4231
02:48:56,620 --> 02:48:56,680
To the train.

4232
02:49:10,580 --> 02:49:12,660
I'll send it to the train bus as soon as possible.

4233
02:49:13,100 --> 02:49:14,860
Something else.

4234
02:49:15,560 --> 02:49:16,840
Ta-da!

4235
02:49:18,660 --> 02:49:19,500
Anyway.

4236
02:49:19,500 --> 02:49:20,800
What the hell did I do?

4237
02:49:20,800 --> 02:49:21,040
Uhh!

4238
02:49:21,840 --> 02:49:22,680
Uh...

4239
02:49:22,680 --> 02:49:23,460
for the won...

4240
02:49:24,980 --> 02:49:26,900
Especially, for the game.

4241
02:49:26,900 --> 02:49:30,800
In Strat囡 here...

4242
02:49:30,800 --> 02:49:31,740
somebody need to complete this together.

4243
02:49:32,500 --> 02:49:38,800
Wait, I wanna... I wanna like... Oh my god, where the fuck is the sensitivity?

4244
02:49:39,620 --> 02:49:41,180
Adjust settings, there we go.

4245
02:49:41,700 --> 02:49:42,840
Okay, let's see.

4246
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:43,900
Left mouse.

4247
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,300
Okay, we definitely need to adjust the sensitivity.

4248
02:49:46,840 --> 02:49:48,260
I think everything else is fine.

4249
02:49:48,620 --> 02:49:50,480
Alright, I don't know the sound... oh yeah, sound guy.

4250
02:49:51,660 --> 02:49:52,540
Uh... alright.

4251
02:49:52,540 --> 02:49:53,200
Alright, here.

4252
02:49:58,270 --> 02:50:02,100
Oh my god, why is this... why is this... this sensitivity so bad?

4253
02:50:02,500 --> 02:50:03,160
Okay, controllers.

4254
02:50:03,540 --> 02:50:04,720
Alright, we do have two.

4255
02:50:05,080 --> 02:50:05,840
This should be better.

4256
02:50:09,740 --> 02:50:11,340
I don't need instructions!

4257
02:50:11,700 --> 02:50:13,960
Lock or door... nobody can leave.

4258
02:50:14,420 --> 02:50:14,900
Wow!

4259
02:50:15,820 --> 02:50:16,960
Nobody can leave.

4260
02:50:26,620 --> 02:50:28,980
Oh, I can make the desk light lighter.

4261
02:50:34,640 --> 02:50:35,200
Active!

4262
02:50:38,320 --> 02:50:39,240
Oh, attention!

4263
02:50:39,520 --> 02:50:40,580
That's the attention button!

4264
02:50:46,160 --> 02:50:47,740
They removed the brake.

4265
02:50:48,540 --> 02:50:50,300
Why did they remove the brake?

4266
02:50:52,620 --> 02:50:54,320
This controls the direct...

4267
02:50:55,880 --> 02:50:59,080
Set the headlights to indicate that this train is operational.

4268
02:50:59,620 --> 02:51:00,120
Yeah!

4269
02:51:00,300 --> 02:51:02,000
The train is operational, guys!

4270
02:51:05,060 --> 02:51:06,400
Oh, let's open the window!

4271
02:51:06,460 --> 02:51:07,820
I want the fresh air!

4272
02:51:08,560 --> 02:51:10,120
I want the fresh air!

4273
02:51:12,620 --> 02:51:13,840
How do I turn this on?

4274
02:51:15,420 --> 02:51:16,500
Oh, hey, what's this?

4275
02:51:20,120 --> 02:51:21,040
What is that?

4276
02:51:22,240 --> 02:51:23,400
Oh, I turned it off.

4277
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:24,280
Okay.

4278
02:51:24,540 --> 02:51:25,380
What's this?

4279
02:51:28,020 --> 02:51:29,820
There's so many buttons!

4280
02:51:32,700 --> 02:51:33,540
We don't need... wait.

4281
02:51:33,820 --> 02:51:34,680
Parking... wait.

4282
02:51:34,740 --> 02:51:36,100
Parking brake release.

4283
02:51:37,760 --> 02:51:39,200
Did I not turn on the lights?

4284
02:51:40,040 --> 02:51:41,300
Oh, there it is!

4285
02:51:44,740 --> 02:51:45,380
On!

4286
02:51:47,800 --> 02:51:51,400
Oh, I took the brakes with me!

4287
02:51:51,860 --> 02:51:53,060
Release brake handle.

4288
02:51:54,600 --> 02:51:56,820
Why did I take the brake with me?

4289
02:51:59,740 --> 02:52:00,280
Release.

4290
02:52:03,460 --> 02:52:05,680
Okay, there's motion blur going in here.

4291
02:52:05,920 --> 02:52:07,240
I need to get that shit away.

4292
02:52:07,840 --> 02:52:11,560
Like, why is there motion blur when I'm driving my train?

4293
02:52:13,120 --> 02:52:14,080
What the fuck?

4294
02:52:14,460 --> 02:52:16,140
HUD advanced settings.

4295
02:52:16,360 --> 02:52:17,100
Okay, there we go.

4296
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:19,380
Post view... wait.

4297
02:52:19,760 --> 02:52:21,380
There's no motion blur?

4298
02:52:21,380 --> 02:52:25,080
I can feel the motion blur, but I can't turn it...

4299
02:52:25,080 --> 02:52:27,320
Max FPS is 62?

4300
02:52:27,700 --> 02:52:30,480
No, I need good frames for my driving.

4301
02:52:30,800 --> 02:52:31,280
I...

4302
02:52:31,280 --> 02:52:35,800
I can't believe it.

4303
02:52:35,840 --> 02:52:37,780
I can't believe I can't turn on motion...

4304
02:52:37,780 --> 02:52:40,540
I can feel the motion blur, too.

4305
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:44,660
I know it's there!

4306
02:52:44,740 --> 02:52:46,160
You can't lie to me!

4307
02:52:46,220 --> 02:52:47,620
I have gamer eyes!

4308
02:52:49,740 --> 02:52:51,120
I know it's there!

4309
02:52:51,120 --> 02:52:51,120
You can't lie to me!

4310
02:52:51,120 --> 02:52:51,120
I have gamer eyes!

4311
02:52:51,120 --> 02:52:51,360
I know it's there!

4312
02:52:51,360 --> 02:52:51,360
You can't lie to me!

4313
02:52:51,360 --> 02:52:51,360
I have gamer eyes!

4314
02:52:51,360 --> 02:52:52,380
You can't lie to me!

4315
02:52:52,420 --> 02:52:54,120
I can feel the motion blur!

4316
02:52:54,800 --> 02:52:57,240
Oh, is that the train brake to drive?

4317
02:52:58,560 --> 02:52:59,120
Okay.

4318
02:53:01,380 --> 02:53:01,940
Oh.

4319
02:53:10,150 --> 02:53:11,570
Unlock all doors.

4320
02:53:11,950 --> 02:53:14,270
Guys, you can come on the train now!

4321
02:53:16,050 --> 02:53:17,130
Wait, I wanna see!

4322
02:53:17,230 --> 02:53:17,810
I wanna see!

4323
02:53:18,510 --> 02:53:19,570
I wanna see!

4324
02:53:23,150 --> 02:53:25,230
I wanna see you guys get in!

4325
02:53:26,450 --> 02:53:27,730
Screw this tutorial!

4326
02:53:28,230 --> 02:53:29,570
It won't let me see!

4327
02:53:38,830 --> 02:53:44,450
I don't understand!

4328
02:53:44,710 --> 02:53:47,310
I said skip tutorial and it won't let me see.

4329
02:53:47,310 --> 02:53:47,770
See you!

4330
02:53:50,910 --> 02:53:51,870
Left doors closed.

4331
02:53:54,550 --> 02:53:56,510
Okay, I need to close all doors.

4332
02:53:56,990 --> 02:53:58,550
All doors are locked now.

4333
02:53:58,670 --> 02:53:59,850
Nobody can leave.

4334
02:54:02,970 --> 02:54:03,610
Nice.

4335
02:54:09,370 --> 02:54:10,010
Alright.

4336
02:54:14,330 --> 02:54:15,070
Let's go.

4337
02:54:19,540 --> 02:54:20,840
Hey guys, the window is open.

4338
02:54:20,980 --> 02:54:22,140
Let the air in!

4339
02:54:22,600 --> 02:54:23,880
Let it all in!

4340
02:54:30,140 --> 02:54:30,660
Oh,

4341
02:54:34,060 --> 02:54:34,460
okay.

4342
02:54:49,540 --> 02:54:49,820
Speeding.

4343
02:54:50,060 --> 02:54:54,600
Apply a small amount of braking force by moving the master controller into the room.

4344
02:54:54,600 --> 02:54:56,520
You're making me stop at a location?

4345
02:54:56,840 --> 02:54:58,800
What if I don't want to stop?

4346
02:54:58,840 --> 02:54:59,240
Oh wait, no.

4347
02:54:59,280 --> 02:55:00,240
That's where you guys have to get off.

4348
02:55:00,280 --> 02:55:00,740
Never mind.

4349
02:55:03,380 --> 02:55:04,260
Never mind.

4350
02:55:04,920 --> 02:55:06,780
You guys have to stop there.

4351
02:55:07,100 --> 02:55:08,420
I want to get off.

4352
02:55:08,440 --> 02:55:09,780
I want to stand up.

4353
02:55:10,580 --> 02:55:12,260
You're now approaching the station.

4354
02:55:13,020 --> 02:55:18,540
Begin applying a small amount of braking force by moving the master controller into the room.

4355
02:55:18,960 --> 02:55:19,520
Oops.

4356
02:55:20,480 --> 02:55:21,240
Whoops.

4357
02:55:22,280 --> 02:55:23,880
Almost an emergency brake.

4358
02:55:23,920 --> 02:55:29,280
Oh, that was awkward.

4359
02:55:30,760 --> 02:55:33,600
It said small and I'm sort of...

4360
02:55:33,600 --> 02:55:35,960
It said nice job!

4361
02:55:39,500 --> 02:55:40,260
Alright.

4362
02:55:45,280 --> 02:55:46,680
Get off the train, guys.

4363
02:55:54,170 --> 02:55:54,310
Get off!

4364
02:55:57,840 --> 02:55:58,320
Alright.

4365
02:55:58,340 --> 02:56:00,940
Close doors and drive to the next station unguided.

4366
02:56:01,320 --> 02:56:02,560
Oh, I cannot!

4367
02:56:02,860 --> 02:56:04,100
I don't need to be guided anymore!

4368
02:56:05,180 --> 02:56:05,660
Guys!

4369
02:56:08,540 --> 02:56:10,140
They're not gonna guide me!

4370
02:56:11,460 --> 02:56:12,680
I'm not closing my window.

4371
02:56:12,900 --> 02:56:13,820
You can't stop me.

4372
02:56:14,760 --> 02:56:16,180
My windows are gonna be open.

4373
02:56:16,300 --> 02:56:17,880
I want to get off this...

4374
02:56:20,780 --> 02:56:21,260
Okay.

4375
02:56:23,300 --> 02:56:24,260
Am I driving?

4376
02:56:26,860 --> 02:56:28,180
Why am I not driving?

4377
02:56:30,480 --> 02:56:31,480
What did I do?

4378
02:56:31,900 --> 02:56:34,740
How did I fuck it up already?

4379
02:56:35,860 --> 02:56:38,140
Oh, it's because I need to do it 100, right?

4380
02:56:43,690 --> 02:56:44,150
Start.

4381
02:56:46,910 --> 02:56:47,370
Start!

4382
02:56:49,230 --> 02:56:50,630
How did I mess it up?

4383
02:56:55,100 --> 02:56:55,560
Drive.

4384
02:56:57,300 --> 02:56:59,200
Guys, how did I mess this up already?

4385
02:57:02,020 --> 02:57:03,280
It's already locked!

4386
02:57:03,660 --> 02:57:04,860
Everything is locked.

4387
02:57:05,040 --> 02:57:05,820
I made sure.

4388
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,440
I made sure everything was locked.

4389
02:57:14,600 --> 02:57:15,200
Okay.

4390
02:57:20,150 --> 02:57:20,750
Drive.

4391
02:57:26,150 --> 02:57:29,630
Guys, she left me and now I don't know how I fucked it up.

4392
02:57:33,590 --> 02:57:34,190
Guys!

4393
02:57:34,190 --> 02:57:38,050
Guys, she left me and I've somehow fucked it up.

4394
02:57:38,130 --> 02:57:40,250
I don't know what I did.

4395
02:57:51,040 --> 02:57:52,880
How did I mess it up?

4396
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:53,740
Oh, I did it!

4397
02:57:57,180 --> 02:57:57,860
Yeah!

4398
02:58:00,200 --> 02:58:01,260
I did it!

4399
02:58:01,400 --> 02:58:03,240
I don't know what I did.

4400
02:58:05,520 --> 02:58:06,200
Yeah!

4401
02:58:09,020 --> 02:58:09,700
Okay.

4402
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:11,400
And then...

4403
02:58:12,240 --> 02:58:13,800
I'm level 2 driver!

4404
02:58:14,040 --> 02:58:15,000
I got an achievement!

4405
02:58:15,380 --> 02:58:15,700
Chat!

4406
02:58:17,980 --> 02:58:18,980
Oh my god!

4407
02:58:19,160 --> 02:58:19,640
Okay, wait.

4408
02:58:19,760 --> 02:58:20,780
Instrumental light.

4409
02:58:21,180 --> 02:58:22,200
Lights off.

4410
02:58:23,100 --> 02:58:24,460
You guys...

4411
02:58:24,460 --> 02:58:26,260
Wait, cab, train lights?

4412
02:58:26,460 --> 02:58:27,740
Wait, you guys don't need lights.

4413
02:58:28,700 --> 02:58:30,300
Okay, instrument lights.

4414
02:58:31,240 --> 02:58:32,440
Sander off.

4415
02:58:34,140 --> 02:58:35,320
Where do I have to go?

4416
02:58:36,720 --> 02:58:37,960
Where's my next stop?

4417
02:58:38,300 --> 02:58:39,280
Is it that one?

4418
02:58:39,420 --> 02:58:40,540
In 500 meters?

4419
02:58:41,300 --> 02:58:42,400
You guys don't need lights.

4420
02:58:42,600 --> 02:58:44,500
I can't even see you guys!

4421
02:58:44,560 --> 02:58:46,080
It won't let me leave the train!

4422
02:58:47,080 --> 02:58:48,160
It's not fair!

4423
02:58:48,340 --> 02:58:49,740
I can literally see the door!

4424
02:58:53,620 --> 02:58:55,660
I can see the door!

4425
02:58:55,800 --> 02:58:57,800
I know you guys are there!

4426
02:59:00,500 --> 02:59:01,540
I know you guys are there!

4427
02:59:01,540 --> 02:59:01,940
I know you guys are there!

4428
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:02,360
I know you guys are there!

4429
02:59:02,360 --> 02:59:02,420
I know you guys are there!

4430
02:59:02,420 --> 02:59:04,980
I know you guys are there!

4431
02:59:07,400 --> 02:59:09,220
Alright, emergency breaks again.

4432
02:59:09,400 --> 02:59:09,880
It's okay.

4433
02:59:10,260 --> 02:59:11,480
It works, guys.

4434
02:59:13,440 --> 02:59:14,100
Yay!

4435
02:59:17,060 --> 02:59:17,720
Alright.

4436
02:59:19,560 --> 02:59:20,880
And then...

4437
02:59:21,420 --> 02:59:23,380
Alright, now you guys can leave.

4438
02:59:23,660 --> 02:59:25,080
If you want to.

4439
02:59:26,360 --> 02:59:28,980
Why is there glue on the seats?

4440
02:59:28,980 --> 02:59:31,520
Thank you for the super chat.

4441
02:59:31,620 --> 02:59:32,440
Thank you, thank you.

4442
02:59:33,020 --> 02:59:34,300
I did it!

4443
02:59:38,140 --> 02:59:38,740
Yay!

4444
02:59:42,280 --> 02:59:43,740
I'm so good!

4445
02:59:46,100 --> 02:59:47,300
Okay, what's next round?

4446
02:59:47,520 --> 02:59:50,260
I want to go to... I don't want to train anymore.

4447
02:59:50,340 --> 02:59:51,580
I want to actually drive.

4448
02:59:52,080 --> 02:59:52,680
Alright.

4449
02:59:53,520 --> 02:59:54,680
To the train.

4450
02:59:55,640 --> 02:59:56,840
Jump straight in.

4451
02:59:57,280 --> 02:59:58,860
Do something more.

4452
03:00:00,340 --> 03:00:01,880
I want to be able to walk around.

4453
03:00:03,940 --> 03:00:05,380
You did it, Shroud.

4454
03:00:06,420 --> 03:00:10,280
I knew you were a train conductor at heart, Shroud.

4455
03:00:10,460 --> 03:00:12,360
I fucking knew it.

4456
03:00:17,220 --> 03:00:20,720
Oh my god, I don't... what the fuck was it?

4457
03:00:20,760 --> 03:00:22,020
What are we... what?

4458
03:00:22,760 --> 03:00:24,640
What is this train?

4459
03:00:25,240 --> 03:00:27,040
What the fuck?

4460
03:00:28,740 --> 03:00:30,320
Guys, I cannot see.

4461
03:00:33,920 --> 03:00:35,980
Guys, I can't see the train.

4462
03:00:36,280 --> 03:00:38,760
Guys, how do I turn on the light?

4463
03:00:40,080 --> 03:00:41,940
This train is too high tech.

4464
03:00:42,400 --> 03:00:43,840
I don't like this train.

4465
03:00:43,920 --> 03:00:45,340
It's too high tech for me.

4466
03:00:50,120 --> 03:00:52,200
Guys, I don't like this train.

4467
03:00:55,020 --> 03:00:57,340
This train has too many buttons.

4468
03:01:00,340 --> 03:01:01,260
What do you mean?

4469
03:01:03,640 --> 03:01:04,240
Help.

4470
03:01:04,440 --> 03:01:04,840
Help.

4471
03:01:05,100 --> 03:01:05,400
Help.

4472
03:01:07,660 --> 03:01:10,300
Wait, why is this train digital?

4473
03:01:11,740 --> 03:01:12,600
I'm leaving.

4474
03:01:12,720 --> 03:01:14,280
I can't do this train, guys.

4475
03:01:14,480 --> 03:01:17,800
This train is too much for this tomato.

4476
03:01:18,180 --> 03:01:19,640
This train...

4477
03:01:21,620 --> 03:01:22,220
Alright.

4478
03:01:22,660 --> 03:01:24,080
To the trains.

4479
03:01:25,200 --> 03:01:25,800
Okay.

4480
03:01:25,800 --> 03:01:27,020
Pick a train.

4481
03:01:27,640 --> 03:01:28,760
Rail journeys.

4482
03:01:28,960 --> 03:01:29,440
Got it.

4483
03:01:29,440 --> 03:01:31,720
I don't want like... I don't want people to help me.

4484
03:01:32,480 --> 03:01:34,280
Why is quick play like...

4485
03:01:34,280 --> 03:01:38,600
Why is quick play like... not... not something I can do myself?

4486
03:01:39,720 --> 03:01:41,760
I want to be able to get up and move.

4487
03:01:42,620 --> 03:01:45,640
I don't want some lady to tell me how to drive a train.

4488
03:01:47,720 --> 03:01:49,220
There's at least six buttons.

4489
03:01:49,320 --> 03:01:50,120
Is this the same thing?

4490
03:01:53,740 --> 03:01:54,940
Or can I...

4491
03:01:54,940 --> 03:01:55,980
Oh no.

4492
03:01:57,200 --> 03:01:58,920
Oh yeah, this is the same thing.

4493
03:01:59,280 --> 03:01:59,760
Okay.

4494
03:01:59,760 --> 03:02:02,420
So apparently in quick play, it's just like...

4495
03:02:02,420 --> 03:02:04,740
Quick play is just to fool you.

4496
03:02:04,880 --> 03:02:05,980
To do tutorial.

4497
03:02:08,200 --> 03:02:08,680
Okay.

4498
03:02:09,360 --> 03:02:09,840
Alright.

4499
03:02:09,920 --> 03:02:10,560
To the train.

4500
03:02:10,660 --> 03:02:11,620
Train depot.

4501
03:02:11,840 --> 03:02:12,800
I guess...

4502
03:02:12,800 --> 03:02:14,360
We'll do...

4503
03:02:15,160 --> 03:02:16,520
Jump into a lifelike.

4504
03:02:16,700 --> 03:02:17,460
Okay, lifelike.

4505
03:02:17,700 --> 03:02:18,660
Alright, what do we want?

4506
03:02:20,640 --> 03:02:22,160
Guys, what train do we want?

4507
03:02:22,220 --> 03:02:22,480
Guys.

4508
03:02:23,200 --> 03:02:24,840
What is a cool train?

4509
03:02:26,040 --> 03:02:28,860
Which one was the one that had so many like buttons?

4510
03:02:28,860 --> 03:02:29,740
I don't like that train.

4511
03:02:30,800 --> 03:02:31,700
Choose a route?

4512
03:02:31,860 --> 03:02:33,500
What train do we get, guys?

4513
03:02:34,720 --> 03:02:36,100
Which train is cool?

4514
03:02:46,550 --> 03:02:47,090
801?

4515
03:02:47,390 --> 03:02:47,830
Alright.

4516
03:02:51,450 --> 03:02:51,990
801.

4517
03:02:55,690 --> 03:02:56,770
That train.

4518
03:02:58,950 --> 03:03:00,430
London's King Cross.

4519
03:03:01,090 --> 03:03:01,890
We'll do that.

4520
03:03:03,110 --> 03:03:04,130
I want to be able to get up.

4521
03:03:04,650 --> 03:03:07,350
I want to be able to explore the train cabins.

4522
03:03:10,370 --> 03:03:12,530
Which one runs on coal?

4523
03:03:13,530 --> 03:03:14,710
Alright, how do I leave?

4524
03:03:17,910 --> 03:03:19,850
Why is there more butt?

4525
03:03:20,330 --> 03:03:21,310
What the f...

4526
03:03:25,030 --> 03:03:26,470
What the f...

4527
03:03:26,470 --> 03:03:31,190
How do I get up?

4528
03:03:33,670 --> 03:03:34,710
Setting control.

4529
03:03:36,490 --> 03:03:37,010
Okay.

4530
03:03:37,790 --> 03:03:38,730
Reset automatic.

4531
03:03:38,850 --> 03:03:40,370
I want to get up.

4532
03:03:40,490 --> 03:03:41,630
That's all I want.

4533
03:03:42,830 --> 03:03:43,870
Press E?

4534
03:03:44,690 --> 03:03:45,550
Oh, E.

4535
03:03:45,670 --> 03:03:45,910
Okay.

4536
03:03:47,010 --> 03:03:47,530
Yes!

4537
03:03:50,990 --> 03:03:51,970
Oh my god.

4538
03:03:52,050 --> 03:03:52,470
Guys.

4539
03:03:52,690 --> 03:03:53,210
Guys.

4540
03:03:53,250 --> 03:03:54,170
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

4541
03:03:54,490 --> 03:03:55,010
Okay.

4542
03:03:55,430 --> 03:03:55,950
Alright.

4543
03:03:56,130 --> 03:03:57,570
We got to open the door first.

4544
03:03:58,110 --> 03:03:59,030
Where's the door?

4545
03:04:01,090 --> 03:04:01,870
Down later.

4546
03:04:02,890 --> 03:04:04,470
Okay, you're not getting lights.

4547
03:04:04,970 --> 03:04:05,390
Oh!

4548
03:04:06,950 --> 03:04:07,830

03:04:07,910 --> 03:04:10,670
I'm making sure you guys get...

4550
03:04:11,190 --> 03:04:11,610
Okay.

Here we go.

4552
03:04:12,330 --> 03:04:13,670
We're going to put it on auto.

4553
03:04:14,230 --> 03:04:15,770
Put that on off.

4554
03:04:16,390 --> 03:04:18,030
And then we're going to put...

4555
03:04:19,010 --> 03:04:19,770
Where the f...

4556
03:04:19,770 --> 03:04:20,530
Is DSD?

4557
03:04:21,170 --> 03:04:21,870
Reading light.

4558
03:04:22,010 --> 03:04:22,590
Don't worry, guys.

4559
03:04:22,630 --> 03:04:23,250
I got you guys.

4560
03:04:23,330 --> 03:04:24,550
I got the reading light on too.

4561
03:04:25,050 --> 03:04:26,270
Guys, I got you guys.

4562
03:04:26,490 --> 03:04:27,490
Where are the doors?

4563
03:04:28,150 --> 03:04:29,010
I got everything.

4564
03:04:29,010 --> 03:04:29,550
But...

4565
03:04:29,550 --> 03:04:30,230
Oh, door release.

4566
03:04:33,850 --> 03:04:34,810
Are you guys...

4567
03:04:34,810 --> 03:04:35,310
CCTV?

4568
03:04:38,670 --> 03:04:39,630
The door release?

4569
03:04:42,890 --> 03:04:44,030
I'm loading passengers.

4570
03:04:44,370 --> 03:04:45,290
Am I loading passengers?

4571
03:04:45,490 --> 03:04:46,450
Are you guys getting in?

4572
03:04:46,890 --> 03:04:47,170
Oh!

4573
03:04:48,550 --> 03:04:49,110
Sorry.

4574
03:04:51,270 --> 03:04:52,390
Are you guys scared?

4575
03:04:55,270 --> 03:04:56,290
Holy f...

4576
03:04:56,290 --> 03:04:59,430
I got scared the shit out of me.

4577
03:04:59,730 --> 03:05:00,290
Oh!

4578
03:05:00,410 --> 03:05:00,510
Oh!

4579
03:05:00,510 --> 03:05:00,950
Oh!

4580
03:05:01,050 --> 03:05:01,590
Who are you?

4581
03:05:02,870 --> 03:05:04,330
Who are you?

4582
03:05:05,610 --> 03:05:07,210
Wrong game.

4583
03:05:07,510 --> 03:05:09,930
What is this fucking platform 8 shit?

4584
03:05:10,710 --> 03:05:13,830
I haven't played platform 8 yet.

4585
03:05:14,690 --> 03:05:16,050
Where's the microwave?

4586
03:05:16,750 --> 03:05:17,970
There's people here!

4587
03:05:18,470 --> 03:05:19,650
Hello, dragons!

4588
03:05:19,870 --> 03:05:21,370
I'm your conductor today.

4589
03:05:22,810 --> 03:05:23,610
Guys!

4590
03:05:23,730 --> 03:05:24,090
Hey!

4591
03:05:24,190 --> 03:05:25,370
I'm your conductor today.

4592
03:05:25,910 --> 03:05:27,390
How are you guys doing?

4593
03:05:27,890 --> 03:05:28,450
How are you guys doing?

4594
03:05:28,450 --> 03:05:29,030
I'm...

4595
03:05:29,030 --> 03:05:29,570

4596
03:05:29,570 --> 03:05:30,870

4597
03:05:30,870 --> 03:05:30,930

4598
03:05:30,930 --> 03:05:30,970

03:05:31,050 --> 03:05:31,310
I'm just doing!

4601
03:05:32,850 --> 03:05:35,470
You guys had a great time trying to find the microwave.

4602
03:05:36,290 --> 03:05:39,290
I know there's like supposed to be a microwave here.

4603
03:05:40,030 --> 03:05:41,830
I'm trying to find it right now.

4604
03:05:42,230 --> 03:05:43,870
You guys know where the microwaves are?

4605
03:05:44,270 --> 03:05:45,750
I saw it on the trailer.

4606
03:05:46,930 --> 03:05:49,030
On the trailer there was a microwave.

4607
03:05:49,210 --> 03:05:50,750
I just want to know where it is.

4608
03:05:52,830 --> 03:05:54,030
We can't get off the train?

4609
03:05:54,250 --> 03:05:55,030
Oh my god!

4610
03:05:55,070 --> 03:05:55,970
I'm fucking free!

4611
03:05:57,650 --> 03:05:59,370
Is there a microwave here?

4612
03:05:59,610 --> 03:06:00,190
I don't know.

4613
03:06:00,190 --> 03:06:00,310
I don't know.

4614
03:06:01,050 --> 03:06:01,930
What about here?

4615
03:06:02,490 --> 03:06:03,390
Oh my god!

4616
03:06:03,450 --> 03:06:05,010
It's the back of the train!

4617
03:06:06,330 --> 03:06:08,190
There's the back of the train!

4618
03:06:08,630 --> 03:06:10,030
This train doesn't have...

4619
03:06:10,030 --> 03:06:10,730
There it is!

4620
03:06:10,990 --> 03:06:12,370
This is what I saw guys!

4621
03:06:12,730 --> 03:06:13,650
The microwave!

4622
03:06:14,930 --> 03:06:17,710
Wait, I can't even use the microwave!

4623
03:06:18,130 --> 03:06:19,030
9 out of 10.

4624
03:06:19,610 --> 03:06:20,810
Can't use the microwave.

4625
03:06:20,830 --> 03:06:21,630
I'm so sad.

4626
03:06:22,390 --> 03:06:25,050
Oh, this is like the VIP, the first class lounge.

4627
03:06:25,190 --> 03:06:28,090
There's nobody rich enough to be in the first class seat?

4628
03:06:28,550 --> 03:06:28,890
Dragons!

4629
03:06:29,290 --> 03:06:30,430
What's going on?

4630
03:06:30,650 --> 03:06:31,030
I'm so sad.

4631
03:06:33,470 --> 03:06:33,950
I'm going to get in the first class.

4632
03:06:33,950 --> 03:06:34,110
Guys!

4633
03:06:34,250 --> 03:06:34,630
Come on!

4634
03:06:34,630 --> 03:06:35,270
Get in my train!

4635
03:06:35,650 --> 03:06:36,130
Guys!

4636
03:06:36,210 --> 03:06:36,530
Come on!

4637
03:06:37,170 --> 03:06:37,650
Guys!

4638
03:06:37,790 --> 03:06:41,570
I know you guys have the money to pay for first class!

4639
03:06:41,710 --> 03:06:43,090
You literally live in London!

4640
03:06:43,670 --> 03:06:44,890
You think I don't know that?

4641
03:06:45,170 --> 03:06:47,170
Only the rich british live in London!

4642
03:06:47,350 --> 03:06:48,430
Get on the first class!

4643
03:06:48,630 --> 03:06:50,050
Pay for my first class ticket!

4644
03:06:51,550 --> 03:06:52,890
You live in London!

4645
03:06:54,050 --> 03:06:55,810
I know you have money there!

4646
03:06:57,090 --> 03:06:58,790
Let me tell you!

4647
03:06:59,670 --> 03:07:00,590
I'm fucking lie...

4648
03:07:00,590 --> 03:07:01,010
I don't know.

4649
03:07:01,870 --> 03:07:03,650
London Red is very expensive!

4650
03:07:05,670 --> 03:07:07,250
Oh wait, maybe you guys...

4651
03:07:07,250 --> 03:07:09,830
But you guys would just drive in the car.

4652
03:07:10,010 --> 03:07:11,170
You would not be on the train.

4653
03:07:11,490 --> 03:07:12,230
My bad.

4654
03:07:12,910 --> 03:07:13,590
My bad.

4655
03:07:13,630 --> 03:07:14,750
I forgot like...

4656
03:07:14,750 --> 03:07:17,430
I forgot that...

4657
03:07:18,530 --> 03:07:19,870
You would have your own car.

4658
03:07:19,950 --> 03:07:21,230
You would not be on a train.

4659
03:07:25,370 --> 03:07:27,150
Can't afford first class.

4660
03:07:27,230 --> 03:07:29,350
Spend it all on turkey bridge.

4661
03:07:29,350 --> 03:07:31,450
Thank you for the super chat cast.

4662
03:07:31,630 --> 03:07:31,910
Thank you.

4663
03:07:32,090 --> 03:07:32,530
Thank you.

4664
03:07:32,590 --> 03:07:32,830
Okay.

4665
03:07:33,670 --> 03:07:34,150
Close.

4666
03:07:34,870 --> 03:07:36,350
We are closing the doors now.

4667
03:07:37,810 --> 03:07:38,570
Door closed.

4668
03:07:39,250 --> 03:07:39,730
Okay.

4669
03:07:43,790 --> 03:07:44,270
On!

4670
03:07:46,570 --> 03:07:47,050
Uh...

4671
03:07:47,050 --> 03:07:49,270
Oh, I want to start wiping the windshields.

4672
03:07:50,470 --> 03:07:50,950
Okay.

4673
03:07:51,790 --> 03:07:54,630
I have to make sure our windshield is being wiped right now.

4674
03:07:55,530 --> 03:07:57,150
Windshield wiper speed 10.

4675
03:07:58,430 --> 03:08:00,370
And then engine start.

4676
03:08:02,490 --> 03:08:03,050
Uh...

4677
03:08:03,730 --> 03:08:05,910
Guess there is a lot of buttons.

4678
03:08:08,230 --> 03:08:10,070
Is it wiping my windshield?

4679
03:08:10,910 --> 03:08:12,550
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

4680
03:08:12,850 --> 03:08:13,950
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

4681
03:08:15,850 --> 03:08:17,090
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

4682
03:08:17,090 --> 03:08:17,230
Okay.

4683
03:08:17,610 --> 03:08:18,430
We got that.

4684
03:08:20,010 --> 03:08:20,570
Uh...

4685
03:08:22,290 --> 03:08:22,850
Uh...

4686
03:08:23,950 --> 03:08:25,630
Oh hey, it's starting to wipe.

4687
03:08:25,930 --> 03:08:26,910
Are we... Guys!

4688
03:08:27,190 --> 03:08:28,090
Give me a sec!

4689
03:08:28,190 --> 03:08:30,070
It's my first time on this train!

4690
03:08:30,450 --> 03:08:31,010
It's my first time on this train!

4691
03:08:33,920 --> 03:08:34,600
Forward.

4692
03:08:35,240 --> 03:08:36,360
Where's the other?

4693
03:08:38,420 --> 03:08:39,800
Where's the other one?

4694
03:08:40,680 --> 03:08:42,240
Where's the other lever?

4695
03:08:47,540 --> 03:08:48,940
Oh, there you go!

4696
03:08:50,700 --> 03:08:52,240
Am I going forward?

4697
03:08:54,500 --> 03:08:55,300
Am I going forward?

4698
03:08:57,640 --> 03:08:59,340
Am I not going forward?

4699
03:08:59,760 --> 03:09:01,760
Why am I...

4700
03:09:01,760 --> 03:09:03,940
Why am I...

4701
03:09:06,040 --> 03:09:07,960
My windshield is going up.

4702
03:09:08,100 --> 03:09:09,300
Guys, we might be a little late.

4703
03:09:09,460 --> 03:09:12,060
This is my first time driving this train.

4704
03:09:12,540 --> 03:09:13,600
This is my first time driving this train.

4705
03:09:14,700 --> 03:09:15,300
Brake?

4706
03:09:15,320 --> 03:09:16,200
There is a brake?

4707
03:09:16,740 --> 03:09:17,880
There's so...

4708
03:09:17,880 --> 03:09:19,180
Where's the brake?

4709
03:09:19,820 --> 03:09:20,240
What?

4710
03:09:20,600 --> 03:09:22,500
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

4711
03:09:24,100 --> 03:09:25,760
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

4712
03:09:26,320 --> 03:09:26,920
Hello?

4713
03:09:28,100 --> 03:09:28,700
Hello?

4714
03:09:28,700 --> 03:09:30,680
I don't know where the brake is.

4715
03:09:30,860 --> 03:09:32,860
Can somebody call me back?

4716
03:09:34,520 --> 03:09:37,600
Guys, I don't know where the brake is.

4717
03:09:37,720 --> 03:09:38,600
Guys, I don't know where the brake is.

4718
03:09:38,600 --> 03:09:40,380
Somebody call me back, please.

4719
03:09:41,200 --> 03:09:41,880
Somebody call me back, please.

4720
03:09:41,880 --> 03:09:42,160
Please!

4721
03:09:42,600 --> 03:09:44,640
Don't get so scared and confused.

4722
03:09:46,240 --> 03:09:47,040
Don't get so scared and confused.

4723
03:09:47,400 --> 03:09:48,800
Don't get so scared and confused.

4724
03:09:48,960 --> 03:09:49,640
Oh...

4725
03:09:50,780 --> 03:09:51,460
Forward.

4726
03:09:57,490 --> 03:09:58,730
Where is it?

4727
03:10:00,590 --> 03:10:01,750
Where's the...

4728
03:10:01,750 --> 03:10:03,510
Where is it?

4729
03:10:03,830 --> 03:10:05,670
Ha ha ha ha ha!

4730
03:10:06,850 --> 03:10:09,130
Oh no, we don't need to open that door.

4731
03:10:09,290 --> 03:10:10,190
Is that it?

4732
03:10:10,850 --> 03:10:12,110
Local door.

4733
03:10:12,130 --> 03:10:13,130
Door of release.

4734
03:10:14,230 --> 03:10:14,910
Guys!

4735
03:10:15,270 --> 03:10:16,910
This ain't funny anymore.

4736
03:10:17,030 --> 03:10:17,670
Where's...

4737
03:10:17,670 --> 03:10:19,230
Where's forward?

4738
03:10:21,310 --> 03:10:22,950
Master key is on!

4739
03:10:26,010 --> 03:10:27,870
I'm going forward!

4740
03:10:31,960 --> 03:10:32,640
Uh...

4741
03:10:35,140 --> 03:10:36,400
Where is it?

4742
03:10:37,320 --> 03:10:37,440
Oh, brake.

4743
03:10:37,640 --> 03:10:39,020
Is that from Snowpiercer?

4744
03:10:39,280 --> 03:10:40,340
Oh, there it is!

4745
03:10:40,540 --> 03:10:40,800
Okay.

4746
03:10:42,980 --> 03:10:43,840
Brake release.

4747
03:10:48,530 --> 03:10:49,510
Is that it?

4748
03:10:50,350 --> 03:10:52,350
Guys, who's driven this train before?

4749
03:10:52,790 --> 03:10:55,370
Has anyone else drove this train before?

4750
03:10:55,630 --> 03:10:57,830
Ha ha ha ha ha!

4751
03:10:58,310 --> 03:10:59,990
Ha ha ha ha ha!

4752
03:11:00,590 --> 03:11:01,230
Guys!

4753
03:11:02,170 --> 03:11:05,310
Has anyone else drove this train before?

4754
03:11:05,430 --> 03:11:07,590
We need to figure this out.

4755
03:11:08,430 --> 03:11:09,070
Ha ha ha ha!

4756
03:11:10,130 --> 03:11:11,150
Ha ha ha ha!

4757
03:11:12,290 --> 03:11:13,930
Guys, this is very important.

4758
03:11:14,130 --> 03:11:15,450
We need... Oh, there's a cup holder.

4759
03:11:15,710 --> 03:11:18,130
We need to know how to go forward.

4760
03:11:18,190 --> 03:11:18,650
Guys!

4761
03:11:19,710 --> 03:11:22,610
Just go outside and push it.

4762
03:11:23,900 --> 03:11:25,130
What's the drive button?

4763
03:11:25,330 --> 03:11:26,690
There's a horn button!

4764
03:11:28,030 --> 03:11:29,470
There's no drive!

4765
03:11:30,530 --> 03:11:32,510
I'm fucking windshield!

4766
03:11:32,870 --> 03:11:33,850
And then start.

4767
03:11:35,350 --> 03:11:35,930
Start!

4768
03:11:38,710 --> 03:11:39,290
Lisa?

4769
03:11:39,590 --> 03:11:39,770
Lisa?

4770
03:11:45,970 --> 03:11:46,530
Yes.

4771
03:11:47,350 --> 03:11:47,910
Yeah.

4772
03:11:48,310 --> 03:11:49,890
Check the... There's no manual!

4773
03:11:50,410 --> 03:11:52,250
I chose this train!

4774
03:11:52,350 --> 03:11:53,970
You guys picked this train!

4775
03:11:54,530 --> 03:11:57,510
I thought you knew what you're doing when you all picked this train!

4776
03:11:57,790 --> 03:12:00,350
I thought you guys knew what you're doing!

4777
03:12:00,510 --> 03:12:01,790
Ha ha ha ha!

4778
03:12:02,430 --> 03:12:03,830
Ha ha ha ha!

03:12:04,530 --> 03:12:07,090
You all picked this train together!

4780
03:12:08,230 --> 03:12:09,510
Ha ha ha ha!

4781
03:12:10,470 --> 03:12:11,910
Ha ha ha ha!

4782
03:12:12,590 --> 03:12:13,930
It's already maxed!

4783
03:12:16,970 --> 03:12:17,610
Ha ha ha ha!

4784
03:12:17,610 --> 03:12:18,210
Oh my god!

4785
03:12:21,680 --> 03:12:24,240

4786
03:12:24,640 --> 03:12:25,800
I let you guys pick this train!

03:12:25,980 --> 03:12:26,620
Ha ha ha ha!

4788
03:12:26,620 --> 03:12:27,760
Ha ha ha ha!

4789
03:12:28,920 --> 03:12:30,080
Start engine!

4790
03:12:30,900 --> 03:12:31,540
Start!

4791
03:12:35,660 --> 03:12:36,300
Okay.

4792
03:12:37,060 --> 03:12:38,120
I started.

4793
03:12:39,500 --> 03:12:41,060
Alright, I started the engine.

4794
03:12:41,640 --> 03:12:42,280
Alright, I started the engine.

4795
03:12:42,280 --> 03:12:44,680
Guys, it doesn't look like the engine started, guys.

4796
03:12:44,860 --> 03:12:45,580
It does not.

4797
03:12:45,900 --> 03:12:47,560
Guys, we're very behind schedule.

4798
03:12:48,000 --> 03:12:48,640
Okay.

4799
03:12:50,060 --> 03:12:51,340
Someone announced...

4800
03:12:52,400 --> 03:12:53,640
That we're...

4801
03:12:54,580 --> 03:12:56,160
That we're about to start?

4802
03:12:56,440 --> 03:12:57,840
Like pretend that...

4803
03:12:57,840 --> 03:12:58,160
Okay.

4804
03:12:58,600 --> 03:13:00,860
Guys, pretend that we know what we're doing.

4805
03:13:02,880 --> 03:13:03,520
Uhhhhhh...

4806
03:13:03,520 --> 03:13:04,320
Ha ha ha!

4807
03:13:05,700 --> 03:13:06,440
Guys, the...

4808
03:13:06,440 --> 03:13:08,780
The red light?

4809
03:13:11,140 --> 03:13:11,780
Start.

4810
03:13:12,900 --> 03:13:13,540
Start!

4811
03:13:13,680 --> 03:13:13,860
Start!

4812
03:13:16,060 --> 03:13:16,680
Hey...

4813
03:13:18,660 --> 03:13:19,280
Uhhhhhh...

4814
03:13:19,280 --> 03:13:20,920
Turn the reading light on.

4815
03:13:21,650 --> 03:13:23,100
Ha ha ha ha!

4816
03:13:24,100 --> 03:13:25,360
Ha ha ha ha!

4817
03:13:25,360 --> 03:13:26,520
The yellow button that says... Oh!

4818
03:13:29,320 --> 03:13:29,940
Electric!

4819
03:13:30,340 --> 03:13:30,500
Electric!

4820
03:13:31,720 --> 03:13:32,640
I don't know.

4821
03:13:32,700 --> 03:13:36,480
I hope there's no backlog of cars behind us, guys.

4822
03:13:36,720 --> 03:13:36,740
of cars behind us, guys.

4823
03:13:36,960 --> 03:13:38,620
That would be pretty awkward.

4824
03:13:40,040 --> 03:13:43,180
If there's like a backlog of cars behind us.

4825
03:13:43,360 --> 03:13:44,700
Ha ha ha ha!

4826
03:13:47,400 --> 03:13:50,700
There's like a lot of people just waiting on us right now.

4827
03:13:50,880 --> 03:13:50,920
Ha ha ha ha!

4828
03:13:53,990 --> 03:13:55,450
We're figuring this out.

4829
03:13:57,070 --> 03:13:58,250
Close the door?

4830
03:13:58,490 --> 03:14:00,030
The doors are all closed!

4831
03:14:00,810 --> 03:14:01,430
The doors are all closed!

4832
03:14:01,430 --> 03:14:03,490
I made sure of it!

4833
03:14:03,730 --> 03:14:03,950
I made sure of it!

4834
03:14:06,940 --> 03:14:08,000
What am I...

4835
03:14:09,620 --> 03:14:10,820
Oh, my door.

4836
03:14:11,080 --> 03:14:11,860
It's fine.

4837
03:14:12,700 --> 03:14:13,920
You don't need to know.

4838
03:14:15,300 --> 03:14:16,800
I can close it now.

4839
03:14:19,020 --> 03:14:20,060
Local door.

4840
03:14:20,400 --> 03:14:21,400
Close door.

4841
03:14:21,480 --> 03:14:22,080
Door closed.

4842
03:14:22,400 --> 03:14:23,000
Interlocked.

4843
03:14:23,040 --> 03:14:23,300
Okay.

4844
03:14:24,200 --> 03:14:25,060
Control panel.

4845
03:14:25,800 --> 03:14:27,420
Oh, maybe it's the fuse.

4846
03:14:30,100 --> 03:14:32,020
No, everything is fine there.

4847
03:14:32,160 --> 03:14:33,560
Oh, maybe it's back here!

4848
03:14:33,960 --> 03:14:34,560
Okay.

4849
03:14:36,860 --> 03:14:37,460
Isolated.

4850
03:14:38,420 --> 03:14:39,980
Guys, we're behind schedule!

4851
03:14:40,520 --> 03:14:41,120
Doki's...

4852
03:14:41,120 --> 03:14:43,300
The conductor is learning how to ride this car.

4853
03:14:44,560 --> 03:14:45,820
The other cab?

4854
03:14:46,180 --> 03:14:46,780
The other cab?

4855
03:14:46,800 --> 03:14:49,580
There's no way it has anything to do with the other cab.

4856
03:14:49,860 --> 03:14:50,740
Guys, sorry.

4857
03:14:50,860 --> 03:14:51,280
I'm sorry.

4858
03:14:51,480 --> 03:14:52,740
I'm just learning.

4859
03:14:53,540 --> 03:14:55,180
Ha ha ha ha!

4860
03:14:57,200 --> 03:14:58,800
Guys, look.

4861
03:14:58,860 --> 03:15:00,640
I know you're waiting for the other train.

4862
03:15:00,800 --> 03:15:01,140
Guys!

4863
03:15:03,920 --> 03:15:04,540
I'm sorry.

4864
03:15:04,760 --> 03:15:05,580
I'm just learning!

4865
03:15:05,880 --> 03:15:06,540
I'm learning!

4866
03:15:09,260 --> 03:15:09,820
Okay.

4867
03:15:10,940 --> 03:15:11,500
Alright.

4868
03:15:11,800 --> 03:15:13,460
How do I close this door?

4869
03:15:14,060 --> 03:15:14,960
There we go.

4870
03:15:15,500 --> 03:15:16,020
Alright.

4871
03:15:16,140 --> 03:15:16,940
Guys, I'm sorry.

4872
03:15:17,160 --> 03:15:20,420
Your trains will be delayed a little bit too, guys.

4873
03:15:21,180 --> 03:15:22,160
Guys, I'm sorry.

4874
03:15:22,260 --> 03:15:25,280
Your train will also be delayed a little bit.

4875
03:15:25,520 --> 03:15:26,040
Ha ha ha!

4876
03:15:26,720 --> 03:15:28,720
We're gonna figure this out!

4877
03:15:29,280 --> 03:15:30,160
Ha ha ha!

4878
03:15:31,560 --> 03:15:32,720
Do not worry!

4879
03:15:32,980 --> 03:15:34,700
We're gonna figure this out!

4880
03:15:36,380 --> 03:15:37,880
Guys, I'm worrying a little bit.

4881
03:15:37,900 --> 03:15:39,120
Guys, I'm worrying a little bit.

4882
03:15:39,200 --> 03:15:39,600
Guys...

4883
03:15:42,240 --> 03:15:43,440
Guys, I'm...

4884
03:15:43,460 --> 03:15:44,500
I'm a little worried, guys.

4885
03:15:45,020 --> 03:15:46,900
Just a little worried.

4886
03:15:47,860 --> 03:15:49,580
There's another door?

4887
03:15:50,380 --> 03:15:52,140
Where's the other door?

4888
03:15:53,220 --> 03:15:56,140
Where's the other door?

4889
03:15:56,140 --> 03:15:56,740
Oh.

4890
03:15:59,170 --> 03:16:00,600
How do I close this door?

4891
03:16:05,950 --> 03:16:06,690
Door...closed.

4892
03:16:08,670 --> 03:16:09,410
Uh...

4893
03:16:11,690 --> 03:16:12,430
Uh...

4894
03:16:13,770 --> 03:16:14,510
Door...oh!

4895
03:16:15,110 --> 03:16:15,550
Door closed.

4896
03:16:15,690 --> 03:16:16,150
Door closed.

4897
03:16:16,230 --> 03:16:17,130
Nobody's getting out.

4898
03:16:17,570 --> 03:16:18,990
Nobody's getting out of here.

4899
03:16:19,470 --> 03:16:20,010
Okay.

4900
03:16:21,090 --> 03:16:21,630
Nice.

4901
03:16:21,730 --> 03:16:21,930
Alright.

4902
03:16:22,030 --> 03:16:22,370
Nice.

4903
03:16:22,530 --> 03:16:22,830
Okay.

4904
03:16:25,010 --> 03:16:25,550
Alright.

4905
03:16:26,030 --> 03:16:26,570
Now!

4906
03:16:32,140 --> 03:16:32,680
Okay.

4907
03:16:33,060 --> 03:16:34,140
Now we got this.

4908
03:16:35,480 --> 03:16:36,400
Engine start.

4909
03:16:39,900 --> 03:16:40,980
And then...

4910
03:16:42,900 --> 03:16:43,920
And then...

4911
03:16:43,920 --> 03:16:44,320
Oh.

4912
03:16:44,580 --> 03:16:45,120
Oh.

4913
03:16:49,860 --> 03:16:50,680
Reverse or forward?

4914
03:16:50,880 --> 03:16:52,220
And BOOM!

4915
03:16:54,600 --> 03:16:55,320
Guys!

4916
03:16:55,860 --> 03:16:56,580
BOOM!

4917
03:16:57,740 --> 03:16:59,640
Oh, the panograph is down?

4918
03:17:03,800 --> 03:17:04,540
Panograph up.

4919
03:17:07,120 --> 03:17:07,840
Electric.

4920
03:17:10,890 --> 03:17:11,610
BOOM!

4921
03:17:14,010 --> 03:17:15,190
Guys, I don't...

4922
03:17:16,250 --> 03:17:16,970
Guys...

4923
03:17:16,970 --> 03:17:17,790
Ha ha ha!

4924
03:17:21,430 --> 03:17:22,150
Guys...

4925
03:17:22,150 --> 03:17:23,210
Ha ha ha!

4926
03:17:24,410 --> 03:17:26,930
I don't think we're moving, guys.

4927
03:17:27,070 --> 03:17:28,410
I don't think we're moving.

4928
03:17:29,030 --> 03:17:30,390
Ha ha ha!

4929
03:17:30,810 --> 03:17:31,770
Ha ha ha!

4930
03:17:31,770 --> 03:17:32,010
Ha ha ha!

4931
03:17:33,330 --> 03:17:34,990
Why can't we...

4932
03:17:34,990 --> 03:17:37,350
Can't we move our...

4933
03:17:37,920 --> 03:17:38,290
Train?

4934
03:17:38,450 --> 03:17:42,030
All I wanna do is drive this train!

4935
03:17:42,610 --> 03:17:43,290
Ha ha ha!

4936
03:17:43,670 --> 03:17:44,570
Ha ha ha!

4937
03:17:45,850 --> 03:17:46,590
No!

4938
03:17:49,820 --> 03:17:50,190
No!

4939
03:17:50,470 --> 03:17:51,250
We're not...

4940
03:17:52,150 --> 03:17:53,450
We're not an Arab!

4941
03:17:53,770 --> 03:17:57,010
I need a... We just don't know how to start the car!

4942
03:17:57,370 --> 03:17:58,850
That's really it!

4943
03:17:59,150 --> 03:18:02,830
We don't know how to start the car!

4944
03:18:03,390 --> 03:18:04,870
We're all stupid!

4945
03:18:06,230 --> 03:18:06,690
We're...

4946
03:18:06,690 --> 03:18:07,450
Ha ha ha!

4947
03:18:10,090 --> 03:18:12,230
It's an us issue!

4948
03:18:12,610 --> 03:18:13,750
Ha ha ha!

4949
03:18:14,070 --> 03:18:15,450
Ha ha ha!

4950
03:18:15,910 --> 03:18:16,110
Ha ha ha!

4951
03:18:16,490 --> 03:18:19,690
We don't know what to do!

4952
03:18:20,070 --> 03:18:20,850
Ha ha ha!

4953
03:18:22,530 --> 03:18:23,650
Ha ha ha!

4954
03:18:23,750 --> 03:18:24,230
We?

4955
03:18:24,930 --> 03:18:25,730
Yes, we!

4956
03:18:27,230 --> 03:18:28,050
None of us!

4957
03:18:28,110 --> 03:18:29,310
Do you know what to do?

4958
03:18:29,690 --> 03:18:30,370
Ha ha ha!

4959
03:18:31,450 --> 03:18:32,030
Ha ha ha!

4960
03:18:33,730 --> 03:18:35,050
What are you... Alright!

4961
03:18:35,390 --> 03:18:35,910
No, no!

4962
03:18:35,950 --> 03:18:36,870
This is a team effort!

4963
03:18:37,070 --> 03:18:38,410
You can't do this to me!

4964
03:18:38,570 --> 03:18:39,410
This is a team effort!

4965
03:18:39,550 --> 03:18:40,190
You're here!

4966
03:18:40,710 --> 03:18:42,630
Jack Goose, you're on my train!

4967
03:18:42,770 --> 03:18:44,710
This is literally a team effort!

4968
03:18:45,490 --> 03:18:46,470
Ha ha ha!

4969
03:18:47,610 --> 03:18:50,670
Why are you on my train if it's not a team effort?

4970
03:18:50,910 --> 03:18:51,370
Ha ha ha!

4971
03:18:52,150 --> 03:18:53,390
Ha ha ha!

4972
03:18:54,770 --> 03:18:57,350
This... What does it say about you guys?

4973
03:18:57,670 --> 03:18:58,770
Jack Goose!

4974
03:18:59,010 --> 03:19:00,910
You're on this train with us!

4975
03:19:01,150 --> 03:19:02,350
Come into the passenger!

4976
03:19:02,730 --> 03:19:04,910
Come into the conductor chamber!

4977
03:19:05,490 --> 03:19:08,130
We're all gonna try to figure this out till you're there!

4978
03:19:08,490 --> 03:19:09,130
Ha ha!

4979
03:19:09,810 --> 03:19:10,370
Passengers!

4980
03:19:10,690 --> 03:19:11,450
Ha ha!

4981
03:19:12,290 --> 03:19:13,790
This is a group effort!

4982
03:19:14,050 --> 03:19:15,430
This is a group effort!

4983
03:19:15,550 --> 03:19:17,710
I have train enthusiasts in my chat!

4984
03:19:17,950 --> 03:19:18,790
Ha ha ha!

4985

Go out!

4987
03:19:22,150 --> 03:19:23,750
Go outside and push the train!

4988
03:19:23,970 --> 03:19:25,330
Ha ha ha!

4989
03:19:25,790 --> 03:19:27,550

You're not!

4996
03:19:37,310 --> 03:19:40,550
You're gonna get fired from your job if we don't figure this out!

4997
03:19:40,790 --> 03:19:44,730
You're gonna be late for your job because you're on this train!

4998
03:19:47,530 --> 03:19:52,510
If you don't figure... If we don't figure this out together, we just don't know what to do!

4999
03:19:52,510 --> 03:19:53,130
Exactly!

5000
03:19:53,770 --> 03:19:55,310
You wanna go to work?

5001
03:19:55,570 --> 03:19:58,030
You gotta help me figure out how to start the train!

5002
03:19:58,410 --> 03:19:59,730
Ha ha ha!

5003
03:19:59,990 --> 03:20:02,310
The simulation world is anger!

5004
03:20:02,770 --> 03:20:04,010

Guys!

5009
03:20:13,790 --> 03:20:16,150
We don't simulate stress!

5010
03:20:16,690 --> 03:20:18,810
We're all gonna be stressed now!

5011
03:20:20,130 --> 03:20:20,770
Alright!

5012
03:20:20,770 --> 03:20:22,510
Maybe we acknowledge!

5013
03:20:23,010 --> 03:20:24,510
And then we press this!

5014
03:20:25,230 --> 03:20:28,290
And then we... we slip-slide!

5015
03:20:28,430 --> 03:20:31,050
I don't know what the fuck this... I don't know!

5016
03:20:31,190 --> 03:20:32,310

03:20:36,150 --> 03:20:38,950

5019
03:20:40,310 --> 03:20:41,670
What did I press?

5020
03:20:45,510 --> 03:20:46,150

03:20:58,890 --> 03:21:01,690
The game started beeping at me!

5030
03:21:01,750 --> 03:21:04,450
I don't know if that's a good or bad thing!

5031
03:21:05,070 --> 03:21:05,470
Ha ha ha!

5032

03:24:04,350 --> 03:24:09,630
We pressed it but it won't let me Guys this train is too complex.

5107
03:24:09,950 --> 03:24:11,210
I'm getting a tutorial.

5108
03:24:11,730 --> 03:24:13,510

Which train is this again?

5116
03:24:27,530 --> 03:24:28,650
Is this a Metro Link?

5117
03:24:29,250 --> 03:24:30,530
Which one did we play?

5118
03:24:30,770 --> 03:24:31,710

5121
03:24:37,430 --> 03:24:38,570
Was it this train?

5122
03:24:39,330 --> 03:24:40,430
Was this the train?

5123
03:24:40,750 --> 03:24:41,570
Ha ha ha!

5124
03:24:42,130 --> 03:24:43,030
Was this it?

5125
03:24:43,270 --> 03:24:44,310
This was the train.

5126
03:24:44,970 --> 03:24:46,130
I should have learned.

5127
03:24:46,830 --> 03:24:49,430
I should have learned how to drive this train in the beginning.

5128
03:24:49,770 --> 03:24:50,690
Ha ha ha!

5129
03:24:53,050 --> 03:24:54,370
Ha ha ha!

5130
03:24:54,770 --> 03:24:57,910
The conductor left the train to go back to school.

5131
03:24:58,410 --> 03:24:59,350
Ha ha ha!

5132
03:25:02,410 --> 03:25:02,830
Ha ha ha!

5133
03:25:04,650 --> 03:25:08,950
I should have learned how to drive a BF-8301 electric motor.

5134
03:25:08,950 --> 03:25:09,190
Yeah!

5135
03:25:09,190 --> 03:25:10,070
Thank you sir!

5136
03:25:10,570 --> 03:25:14,130
How do I drive this train?

5137
03:25:14,710 --> 03:25:17,430
You will be taken through the critical driving controls.

5138
03:25:17,790 --> 03:25:18,350
You will be taken through the critical driving controls.

5139
03:25:18,350 --> 03:25:18,630
And...

5140
03:25:18,630 --> 03:25:19,750
I left the train.

5141
03:25:19,810 --> 03:25:21,990
The conductor rage quit the last train.

5142
03:25:22,010 --> 03:25:23,550
And now she's back at train school.

5143
03:25:26,750 --> 03:25:27,750
I did it.

5144
03:25:29,710 --> 03:25:31,490
Wait I literally just boarded the train.

5145
03:25:32,250 --> 03:25:34,210
Oh I mean I could do that again.

5146
03:25:34,890 --> 03:25:35,910
Ha ha ha!

5147
03:25:36,210 --> 03:25:37,270
Don't worry I'm gonna...

5148
03:25:37,270 --> 03:25:38,510
I did it.

5149
03:25:40,630 --> 03:25:41,310
Alright.

5150
03:25:41,970 --> 03:25:45,670
For this introduction, you will be completing a full loop of the circuit.

5151
03:25:45,810 --> 03:25:49,430
And performing passenger operations when you reach the next stop.

5152
03:25:51,730 --> 03:25:53,610
Prepare the train for departure.

5153
03:25:56,050 --> 03:25:56,390
Alright.

5154
03:25:56,390 --> 03:25:57,410
Master key.

5155
03:25:58,290 --> 03:26:02,210
The reverser is used to determine the direction of travel.

5156
03:26:06,750 --> 03:26:07,610
Wait what?

5157
03:26:11,420 --> 03:26:12,060
What?

5158
03:26:13,160 --> 03:26:14,740
Oh it wants me in neutral.

5159
03:26:15,300 --> 03:26:16,080
Set the headlights.

5160
03:26:16,400 --> 03:26:18,500
As this will let others around you...

5161
03:26:18,500 --> 03:26:19,140
Is it this?

5162
03:26:19,600 --> 03:26:21,900
Did I not set the headlights?

5163
03:26:23,340 --> 03:26:24,720
Is this why?

5164
03:26:25,440 --> 03:26:26,460
Ha ha ha!

5165
03:26:29,860 --> 03:26:33,080
Was it the headlights this entire time?

5166
03:26:35,210 --> 03:26:36,770
What does it want me to set to?

5167
03:26:37,330 --> 03:26:38,450
Switch to dim.

5168
03:26:38,630 --> 03:26:38,910
Okay.

5169
03:26:40,090 --> 03:26:42,670
Was it the headlights this entire time?

5170
03:26:43,310 --> 03:26:45,570
You need to open the passenger doors.

5171
03:26:46,650 --> 03:26:47,770
There's no way.

03:34:18,140 --> 03:34:20,760
I don't want to close this door.

5362
03:34:23,140 --> 03:34:23,940
Alright...

5363
03:34:24,400 --> 03:34:24,800
Okay.

5364
03:34:25,260 --> 03:34:26,460
Door closed.

5365
03:34:27,380 --> 03:34:28,440
There we go.

5366
03:34:28,600 --> 03:34:29,520
There we go.

5367
03:34:32,720 --> 03:34:33,960
There we go.

5368
03:34:33,960 --> 03:34:34,780
How do I close this door?

5369
03:34:35,780 --> 03:34:36,740
How do I...

5370
03:34:37,840 --> 03:34:39,100
How do I close you?

5371
03:34:41,820 --> 03:34:43,060
How do I close you?

5372
03:34:43,120 --> 03:34:43,900
Oh, there you go.

5373
03:34:45,300 --> 03:34:50,960
Guys, I'm scared just standing in the open like this.

5374
03:34:51,460 --> 03:34:54,080
How do I... How do I close you?

5375
03:34:56,580 --> 03:34:57,100
Oh.

5376
03:34:57,300 --> 03:34:58,680
No, I can only climb!

5377
03:35:00,980 --> 03:35:02,120
What do you mean?

5378
03:35:02,500 --> 03:35:03,020
Okay.

5379
03:35:03,960 --> 03:35:04,700
Where do I close?

5380
03:35:06,060 --> 03:35:06,940
Did I close?

5381
03:35:08,360 --> 03:35:09,420
Oh my god.

5382
03:35:11,900 --> 03:35:13,160
Where are you?

5383
03:35:14,220 --> 03:35:16,640
Guys, how did I close this door?

5384
03:35:21,670 --> 03:35:23,500
The door is stuck!

5385
03:35:25,500 --> 03:35:27,800
All I can do is climb!

5386
03:35:28,740 --> 03:35:29,360
Okay.

5387
03:35:29,440 --> 03:35:32,020
There has to be another closed door.

5388
03:35:32,240 --> 03:35:33,300
There has to be.

5389
03:35:33,380 --> 03:35:33,940
Closed door.

5390
03:35:33,960 --> 03:35:34,400
Closed door.

5391
03:35:34,740 --> 03:35:35,600
Did it close?

5392
03:35:36,020 --> 03:35:36,820
Oh no.

5393
03:35:37,400 --> 03:35:38,180
Guys, please.

5394
03:35:39,820 --> 03:35:41,820
The door is actually stuck.

5395
03:35:43,960 --> 03:35:46,980
I'm going to release all the doors and I'm going to close it.

5396
03:35:48,140 --> 03:35:50,860
Do I give up control of the surface?

5397
03:35:51,840 --> 03:35:52,360
Yes.

5398
03:35:55,540 --> 03:35:56,500
What does it do?

5399
03:36:01,420 --> 03:36:02,700
I gave up control.

5400
03:36:02,760 --> 03:36:03,480
What did it do?

5401
03:36:06,960 --> 03:36:07,900
What did it do?

5402
03:36:11,120 --> 03:36:11,960
Oh!

5403
03:36:12,760 --> 03:36:13,600
Yay!

5404
03:36:20,910 --> 03:36:21,750
Yay!

5405
03:36:22,370 --> 03:36:23,870
We did it, guys!

5406
03:36:25,050 --> 03:36:26,450
We're running!

5407
03:36:30,650 --> 03:36:31,070
Guys!

5408
03:36:31,930 --> 03:36:32,350
Guys!

5409
03:36:32,610 --> 03:36:34,030
We did it!

5410
03:36:34,130 --> 03:36:36,230
The train's running, Dragoon!

5411
03:36:36,790 --> 03:36:37,630
Dragoon.

5412
03:36:37,710 --> 03:36:39,490
The train's running and it's...

5413
03:36:39,490 --> 03:36:39,830
Yay!

5414
03:36:41,230 --> 03:36:43,010
How do I close this door?

5415
03:36:43,010 --> 03:36:43,770
We did it!

5416
03:36:45,450 --> 03:36:47,230
Jaegun, we did it!

5417
03:36:47,270 --> 03:36:47,770
Jaegun!

5418
03:36:49,010 --> 03:36:50,090
No, I didn't!

5419
03:36:50,090 --> 03:36:51,370
No, they didn't fire me!

5420
03:36:51,470 --> 03:36:53,390
They said if I would like to give up.

5421
03:36:53,950 --> 03:36:54,550
So...

5422
03:36:55,490 --> 03:36:56,550
That's different.

5423
03:36:57,710 --> 03:37:00,870
I just retired voluntarily, guys.

5424
03:37:01,170 --> 03:37:02,630
It's different, guys!

5425
03:37:02,830 --> 03:37:04,770
I retired voluntarily!

5426
03:37:07,170 --> 03:37:09,070
Chat, I didn't get fired.

5427
03:37:09,370 --> 03:37:11,850
I got... I volunteered to retire.

5428
03:37:14,810 --> 03:37:15,790
What the fuck?

5429
03:37:15,790 --> 03:37:16,410
Who are you?

5430
03:37:17,350 --> 03:37:18,630
Why are you in my seat?

5431
03:37:18,970 --> 03:37:20,870
I'm gonna press the emergency brake.

5432
03:37:21,910 --> 03:37:23,270
Get off my seat!

5433
03:37:24,990 --> 03:37:25,790
That's fucking right.

5434
03:37:25,850 --> 03:37:26,770
What are you gonna do about it?

5435
03:37:26,950 --> 03:37:27,270
Huh?

5436
03:37:29,130 --> 03:37:30,530
I'm gonna press all your buttons.

5437
03:37:32,470 --> 03:37:33,330
That's fucking right.

5438
03:37:33,370 --> 03:37:34,230
I stopped your engine.

5439
03:37:34,830 --> 03:37:35,990
Wait, how are you still going?

5440
03:37:36,790 --> 03:37:37,710
I'm gonna take the key.

5441
03:37:41,460 --> 03:37:42,240
That's fucking right.

5442
03:37:42,580 --> 03:37:43,740
What are you gonna do about it?

5443
03:37:44,480 --> 03:37:45,680
Wait, why is the train still going?

5444
03:37:59,580 --> 03:38:01,080
It's a ghost train!

5445
03:38:01,760 --> 03:38:03,980
They put chat block on here!

5446
03:38:05,140 --> 03:38:06,440
I'm the co-pilot.

5447
03:38:06,660 --> 03:38:07,340
I'm the coach.

5448
03:38:07,640 --> 03:38:08,800
You literally...

5449
03:38:08,800 --> 03:38:09,900
Oh my god.

5450
03:38:10,240 --> 03:38:11,840
I can't believe it.

5451
03:38:12,020 --> 03:38:14,480
Guys, I'm the co... No, I'm the co-pilot.

5452
03:38:14,900 --> 03:38:15,820
Guys, see?

5453
03:38:15,960 --> 03:38:17,180
I got my baby chair.

5454
03:38:18,160 --> 03:38:19,800
I got my baby chair.

5455
03:38:24,300 --> 03:38:25,460
I'm sitting here.

5456
03:38:27,180 --> 03:38:29,680
I'm like the baby chair.

5457
03:38:29,920 --> 03:38:31,760
Don't piss me off, Dragoons.

5458
03:38:31,800 --> 03:38:33,880
I'm gonna turn off the AC.

5459
03:38:34,960 --> 03:38:35,560
Guys!

5460
03:38:36,460 --> 03:38:37,780
Don't make me angry.

5461
03:38:38,340 --> 03:38:40,340
Oh wait, I'm gonna put it on heat.

5462
03:38:40,620 --> 03:38:41,780
During the summer.

5463
03:38:42,200 --> 03:38:43,380
That's fucking right.

5464
03:38:43,820 --> 03:38:44,640
That's right.

5465
03:38:44,780 --> 03:38:49,560
Even though I can't control the train anymore, I can still control the temperature.

5466
03:38:51,300 --> 03:38:52,380
No AC.

5467
03:38:53,020 --> 03:38:53,720
That's right.

5468
03:38:53,760 --> 03:38:55,560
You don't deserve AC, Dragoons.

5469
03:38:57,500 --> 03:38:58,160
That's right.

5470
03:38:58,260 --> 03:38:59,140
Don't make me...

5471
03:38:59,140 --> 03:39:00,760
Turn off your lights too!

5472
03:39:01,200 --> 03:39:03,700
Oh, I will turn on the reading light too.

5473
03:39:04,180 --> 03:39:05,440
Don't make me do this.

5474
03:39:05,800 --> 03:39:07,080
Not the AC.

5475
03:39:08,580 --> 03:39:10,840
How could you, you monster?

5476
03:39:13,820 --> 03:39:15,160
Are we there yet?

5477
03:39:16,440 --> 03:39:17,600
Are we there yet?

5478
03:39:17,860 --> 03:39:19,180
Did we make it to the stop?

5479
03:39:19,560 --> 03:39:20,060
Yeah.

5480
03:39:20,180 --> 03:39:21,560
What do you mean?

5481
03:39:21,840 --> 03:39:23,120
I'm gonna cook myself.

5482
03:39:24,680 --> 03:39:27,340
I'm gonna turn on the fucking doors too.

5483
03:39:28,560 --> 03:39:29,680
That's fucking right.

5484
03:39:29,880 --> 03:39:30,800
Don't make me...

5485
03:39:32,120 --> 03:39:34,040
Don't make me stop the train forcefully.

5486
03:39:35,740 --> 03:39:37,180
Dragoon, get over here.

5487
03:39:37,540 --> 03:39:38,640
I'm gonna pick you up.

5488
03:39:38,800 --> 03:39:40,160
And I'm gonna open this door.

5489
03:39:40,580 --> 03:39:41,980
Dragoon, you see this door?

5490
03:39:47,500 --> 03:39:49,540
You see that door, Dragoon?

5491
03:39:49,560 --> 03:39:50,000
Dragoon!

5492
03:39:52,700 --> 03:39:53,700
That's fucking right.

5493
03:39:54,160 --> 03:39:55,320
That's fucking right.

5494
03:39:55,560 --> 03:39:57,400
Okay, now I don't know how to close this door.

5495
03:39:57,460 --> 03:39:58,340
So we're gonna leave it open.

5496
03:39:59,700 --> 03:40:01,140
We're gonna leave this door open.

5497
03:40:01,260 --> 03:40:02,980
Because I don't know how to close it.

5498
03:40:05,180 --> 03:40:06,380
Why is it so far?

5499
03:40:09,000 --> 03:40:10,480
Did we pass or stop?

5500
03:40:11,600 --> 03:40:13,180
I think we passed or stopped.

5501
03:40:14,160 --> 03:40:15,060
There's no way.

5502
03:40:15,140 --> 03:40:15,480
Are we...

5503
03:40:16,240 --> 03:40:17,020
Are we close?

5504
03:40:17,560 --> 03:40:18,580
I can't tell.

5505
03:40:19,560 --> 03:40:21,420
I know we're definitely behind schedule.

5506
03:40:22,000 --> 03:40:22,660
I know.

5507
03:40:27,270 --> 03:40:28,200
I think...

5508
03:40:28,200 --> 03:40:30,300
Because it says zero yards.

5509
03:40:32,220 --> 03:40:33,920
So I feel like...

5510
03:40:33,920 --> 03:40:36,200
Are we behind schedule?

5511
03:40:38,500 --> 03:40:40,080
Oh, 10 minute ride.

5512
03:40:40,200 --> 03:40:41,220
Look at top left.

5513
03:40:41,620 --> 03:40:42,200
Oh!

5514
03:40:44,720 --> 03:40:46,800
Holy shit, this is a lot.

5515
03:40:46,800 --> 03:40:48,300
I'm fucking out of here.

5516
03:40:49,240 --> 03:40:49,920
Oh!

5517
03:40:53,320 --> 03:40:55,580
Put me in camera mode.

5518
03:40:55,640 --> 03:40:55,880
What?

5519
03:40:57,820 --> 03:40:58,900
It's okay.

5520
03:40:59,360 --> 03:41:00,080
I can...

5521
03:41:00,080 --> 03:41:00,860
I can...

5522
03:41:00,860 --> 03:41:01,780
I try...

5523
03:41:01,780 --> 03:41:07,660
If I try to jump off, it puts me in camera mode.

5524
03:41:08,280 --> 03:41:09,260
If I try to jump off, it puts me in camera mode.

5525
03:41:09,360 --> 03:41:10,260
If I try to jump off, it puts me in camera mode.

5526
03:41:10,260 --> 03:41:11,180
Are you serious?

5527
03:41:11,420 --> 03:41:12,580
Oh shit, there you go.

5528
03:41:12,660 --> 03:41:13,000
Goodbye.

5529
03:41:13,980 --> 03:41:14,660
Oh.

5530
03:41:14,660 --> 03:41:14,880
Oh.

5531
03:41:17,000 --> 03:41:18,920
At least they have a conductor.

5532
03:41:20,080 --> 03:41:20,640
Yay!

5533
03:41:21,220 --> 03:41:23,680
Wait, I can like walk all the way there?

5534
03:41:24,520 --> 03:41:24,740
Oh.

5535
03:41:26,800 --> 03:41:27,740
Goodbye train.

5536
03:41:28,580 --> 03:41:31,360
I don't think it's gonna stop for me guys.

5537
03:41:34,800 --> 03:41:36,400
This is my train now.

5538
03:41:39,940 --> 03:41:41,940
What train am I on now?

5539
03:41:46,380 --> 03:41:48,300
What the fuck?

5540
03:41:49,340 --> 03:41:50,660
Holy shit.

5541
03:41:51,120 --> 03:41:53,520
I'm on a new train guys.

5542
03:41:54,300 --> 03:41:54,960
Hey!

5543
03:41:56,220 --> 03:41:57,580
New dragoons!

5544
03:41:57,580 --> 03:41:58,500
Hey guys!

5545
03:41:59,820 --> 03:42:00,500
Wow!

5546
03:42:01,240 --> 03:42:03,600
Wait, this train has more people.

5547
03:42:03,920 --> 03:42:05,740
Than my other train.

5548
03:42:06,340 --> 03:42:08,900
How come more of you guys are on this train?

5549
03:42:09,060 --> 03:42:11,220
The one I wasn't driving on.

5550
03:42:12,620 --> 03:42:13,300
Dragoons.

5551
03:42:13,440 --> 03:42:14,640
Why are there more trains?

5552
03:42:14,660 --> 03:42:17,180
Why are there more people on this train?

5553
03:42:18,660 --> 03:42:19,340
Dragoons!

5554
03:42:19,520 --> 03:42:19,820
Huh?

5555
03:42:24,420 --> 03:42:26,140
Why are there more passengers?

5556
03:42:26,660 --> 03:42:29,100
The other train had less passengers.

5557
03:42:31,800 --> 03:42:33,940
This is... this is awkward.

5558
03:42:34,040 --> 03:42:34,400
Guys.

5559
03:42:35,280 --> 03:42:37,080
Wait, are there people actually...

5560
03:42:37,080 --> 03:42:39,560
Guys, there's actually people in first class?

5561
03:42:41,680 --> 03:42:43,200
Why do these dragoons...

5562
03:42:43,200 --> 03:42:44,600
How come these dragoons...

5563
03:42:44,660 --> 03:42:45,300
actually...

5564
03:42:45,300 --> 03:42:47,480
actually pay for first class?

5565
03:42:47,560 --> 03:42:49,240
Compared to my other train?

5566
03:42:49,620 --> 03:42:52,280
Oh no, she found us.

5567
03:42:54,640 --> 03:42:57,320
You guys have some explaining to do.

5568
03:42:58,160 --> 03:43:00,460
This is going to London.

5569
03:43:01,440 --> 03:43:03,220
I can't believe it.

5570
03:43:03,280 --> 03:43:05,840
I can't believe you guys didn't trust me.

5571
03:43:06,400 --> 03:43:06,740
Chat.

5572
03:43:07,020 --> 03:43:10,240
I can't believe none of you guys...

5573
03:43:10,240 --> 03:43:11,300
trust me.

5574
03:43:11,360 --> 03:43:14,160
I say as I press the emergency brake.

5575
03:43:18,320 --> 03:43:20,360
I can't believe it.

5576
03:43:20,480 --> 03:43:20,820
I can't believe it.

5577
03:43:20,820 --> 03:43:23,060
Wait, does that have max brake on?

5578
03:43:23,540 --> 03:43:25,920
Oh, because I press on the emergency brake.

5579
03:43:26,180 --> 03:43:26,700
Oh, because I press on the emergency brake.

5580
03:43:29,320 --> 03:43:31,440
Wait, when is this train going to stop?

5581
03:43:31,820 --> 03:43:32,100
Wait, when is this train going to stop?

5582
03:43:32,100 --> 03:43:35,240
I feel like this train has been going on for a while now too.

5583
03:43:35,860 --> 03:43:37,020
I feel like this train has been going on for a while now too.

5584
03:43:37,240 --> 03:43:39,020
Where are you guys stopping at?

5585
03:43:39,140 --> 03:43:40,380
London's King Cross?

5586
03:43:41,400 --> 03:43:42,740
Next station stop?

5587
03:43:43,580 --> 03:43:44,320
Who's that?

5588
03:43:44,420 --> 03:43:44,640
Is that a train?

5589
03:43:44,660 --> 03:43:45,620
Is that the one I was at?

5590
03:43:45,800 --> 03:43:47,960
Oh, that's the stop I was at earlier.

5591
03:43:48,620 --> 03:43:50,340
We should be close because like...

5592
03:43:50,340 --> 03:43:51,880
I didn't make that much progress.

5593
03:43:52,620 --> 03:43:54,340
So we should be back there soon.

5594
03:43:57,020 --> 03:43:57,900
Leave me.

5595
03:43:58,980 --> 03:43:59,420
Yeah?

5596
03:43:59,860 --> 03:44:01,880
Alright guys, we're going back to where we started.

5597
03:44:01,900 --> 03:44:03,380
That was fun.

5598
03:44:04,380 --> 03:44:05,040
That was fun.

5599
03:44:05,140 --> 03:44:05,860
I think I...

5600
03:44:06,900 --> 03:44:08,240
I think I like...

5601
03:44:08,240 --> 03:44:10,180
I definitely stretched out the train meta.

5602
03:44:10,520 --> 03:44:11,240
I didn't...

5603
03:44:14,940 --> 03:44:15,560
I didn't...

5604
03:44:15,560 --> 03:44:16,060
We played...

5605
03:44:16,060 --> 03:44:18,760
We played three different train games today.

5606
03:44:19,120 --> 03:44:20,460
It was definitely...

5607
03:44:20,460 --> 03:44:21,640
It was pretty fun.

5608
03:44:22,040 --> 03:44:26,860
I think it's better letting the AI drive the train than letting me drive.

5609
03:44:30,020 --> 03:44:32,520
We got three train games in a row, chat.

5610
03:44:32,840 --> 03:44:33,940
Is that crazy?

5611
03:44:34,420 --> 03:44:36,340
We actually played three train games.

5612
03:44:37,300 --> 03:44:42,320
I spent like at least $80 on just train games today.

5613
03:44:42,760 --> 03:44:44,820
Which is like more than like...

5614
03:44:44,820 --> 03:44:49,320
Which is usually a lot more money that I usually spend on like...

5615
03:44:49,320 --> 03:44:51,120
on one stream.

5616
03:44:51,620 --> 03:44:51,960
So...

5617
03:44:57,220 --> 03:44:57,940
So...

5618
03:44:57,940 --> 03:44:59,480
It's still cheaper than...

5619
03:44:59,480 --> 03:45:00,100
Oh, you're right!

5620
03:45:00,200 --> 03:45:03,080
It is cheaper than one singular train...

5621
03:45:03,080 --> 03:45:04,580
Like IRL train ticket.

5622
03:45:04,720 --> 03:45:06,460
Or like IRL train...

5623
03:45:06,460 --> 03:45:07,880
Like those train collectors.

5624
03:45:08,280 --> 03:45:09,000
Are we stopping?

5625
03:45:09,020 --> 03:45:09,320
Are we stopping soon?

5626
03:45:10,060 --> 03:45:11,160
Oh my god, okay.

5627
03:45:11,540 --> 03:45:13,840
Are we stopping?

5628
03:45:15,360 --> 03:45:16,260
Where is it?

5629
03:45:16,300 --> 03:45:16,940
Where's the stop?

5630
03:45:17,220 --> 03:45:17,880
Is that London?

5631
03:45:18,940 --> 03:45:20,600
Is that London's King Cross?

5632
03:45:21,500 --> 03:45:22,820
Why are we slowing down?

5633
03:45:23,800 --> 03:45:25,360
Ma'am, why are you slowing down?

5634
03:45:25,520 --> 03:45:26,360
That's not the stop.

5635
03:45:27,360 --> 03:45:28,960
That doesn't look like the stop.

5636
03:45:29,620 --> 03:45:30,860
I hope the other...

5637
03:45:30,860 --> 03:45:33,480
I hope the other train is almost there.

5638
03:45:34,560 --> 03:45:35,480
I hope...

5639
03:45:39,100 --> 03:45:40,180
I hope...

5640
03:45:40,180 --> 03:45:40,920
I hope...

5641
03:45:40,960 --> 03:45:44,900
I hope the other train is almost at its destination.

5642
03:45:52,060 --> 03:45:54,340
Safely pulling in?

5643
03:45:55,400 --> 03:45:56,280
What's that?

5644
03:45:56,460 --> 03:45:58,120
I don't understand that.

5645
03:45:58,280 --> 03:46:00,160
I don't understand that sentence.

5646
03:46:00,700 --> 03:46:02,660
What do you mean safely pulling in?

5647
03:46:02,740 --> 03:46:03,940
This feels way too slow.

5648
03:46:05,160 --> 03:46:06,720
She's following the rules?

5649
03:46:07,280 --> 03:46:08,000
Rules?

5650
03:46:11,700 --> 03:46:12,420
What?

5651
03:46:12,640 --> 03:46:13,180
What?

5652
03:46:13,480 --> 03:46:14,240
What do you mean rules?

5653
03:46:15,780 --> 03:46:17,820
Alright, let's turn on the high fan.

5654
03:46:18,300 --> 03:46:20,500
And then we're going to turn on...

5655
03:46:20,500 --> 03:46:23,940
We're going to make sure you guys are at a good temperature.

5656
03:46:24,740 --> 03:46:24,780
We're going to make sure you guys are at a good temperature.

5657
03:46:24,920 --> 03:46:26,160
Oh, there it is!

5658
03:46:26,460 --> 03:46:27,420
There's London!

5659
03:46:27,660 --> 03:46:28,220
Cross!

5660
03:46:30,420 --> 03:46:31,700
There it is!

5661
03:46:32,540 --> 03:46:33,940
London King's Cross!

5662
03:46:34,020 --> 03:46:35,160
We made it, guys!

5663
03:46:38,580 --> 03:46:39,760
Oh my god!

5664
03:46:39,780 --> 03:46:40,660
We made it!

5665
03:46:41,580 --> 03:46:43,420
Guys, welcome back!

5666
03:46:46,520 --> 03:46:48,540
Oh my god, chat!

5667
03:46:49,020 --> 03:46:49,980
Oh my god, chat!

5668
03:46:49,980 --> 03:46:51,500
We fucking made it!

5669
03:46:52,200 --> 03:46:52,320
We fucking made it!

5670
03:46:53,280 --> 03:46:55,240
Wait, is this not the destination?

5671
03:46:56,400 --> 03:46:57,040
Oh...

5672
03:46:57,040 --> 03:46:59,760
Wait, is this not London's King's Cross?

5673
03:47:00,100 --> 03:47:02,280
Wait, why did that guy not stop?

5674
03:47:03,420 --> 03:47:04,060
Wait, why did that guy not stop?

5675
03:47:05,020 --> 03:47:07,760
Wait, that train didn't stop, guys.

5676
03:47:08,160 --> 03:47:08,560
Wait, that train didn't stop, guys.

5677
03:47:09,500 --> 03:47:10,140
Guys...

5678
03:47:10,140 --> 03:47:12,880
Don't think this is London's King's Cross.

5679
03:47:13,540 --> 03:47:14,020
Oh my god!

5680
03:47:15,120 --> 03:47:16,020
No, it is!

5681
03:47:16,460 --> 03:47:16,940
Wait...

5682
03:47:18,920 --> 03:47:19,740
Guys, I don't...

5683
03:47:20,320 --> 03:47:22,320
Guys, I don't think that was London's...

5684
03:47:25,560 --> 03:47:27,180
Guess I went to the...

5685
03:47:27,180 --> 03:47:30,500
Guys, I went to the wrong area.

5686
03:47:31,260 --> 03:47:33,060
It's okay, I just got five...

5687
03:47:33,060 --> 03:47:33,600
Wait, what?

5688
03:47:34,220 --> 03:47:35,260
How do I leave?

5689
03:47:36,580 --> 03:47:37,500
How do I...

5690
03:47:37,500 --> 03:47:39,460
How did all of you guys leave?

5691
03:47:40,600 --> 03:47:43,800
Oh, this is when you guys want to board to a new area.

5692
03:47:45,720 --> 03:47:47,180
Oh, I see.

5693
03:47:47,960 --> 03:47:49,020
Where are we going?

5694
03:47:49,600 --> 03:47:50,580
Guys, I think...

5695
03:47:50,580 --> 03:47:52,200
I don't think I went to London.

5696
03:47:52,640 --> 03:47:53,500
King's Cross.

5697
03:47:55,020 --> 03:47:55,540
Guys...

5698
03:47:55,540 --> 03:47:57,200
I don't think that...

5699
03:48:01,480 --> 03:48:03,220
Guys, I can't...

5700
03:48:03,220 --> 03:48:04,600
How do I get out?

5701
03:48:05,200 --> 03:48:06,460
Oh, there it is!

5702
03:48:06,460 --> 03:48:08,340
There it is!

5703
03:48:10,200 --> 03:48:11,420
Oh my god!

5704
03:48:11,700 --> 03:48:12,340
No!

5705
03:48:13,860 --> 03:48:16,820
My soul is tied to the train!

5706
03:48:17,320 --> 03:48:18,260
My soul is tied to the train!

5707
03:48:18,680 --> 03:48:20,240
My soul is tied to the train!

5708
03:48:20,240 --> 03:48:21,280
Oh no, JK.

5709
03:48:21,600 --> 03:48:22,580
JK, I...

5710
03:48:22,580 --> 03:48:24,080
JK, I could open the door.

5711
03:48:24,280 --> 03:48:25,460
Okay, we're fine.

5712
03:48:27,120 --> 03:48:28,160
We're fine.

5713
03:48:29,800 --> 03:48:33,100
No, I'm stuck in the train I mentioned.

5714
03:48:33,760 --> 03:48:34,520
No, I'm stuck in the train I mentioned.

5715
03:48:35,600 --> 03:48:36,240
No!

5716
03:48:36,460 --> 03:48:39,600
I'm stuck in the train I mentioned!

5717
03:48:39,900 --> 03:48:42,240
My soul can't leave!

5718
03:48:43,400 --> 03:48:44,240
No!

5719
03:48:44,580 --> 03:48:45,500
No!

5720
03:48:46,620 --> 03:48:47,540
No!

5721
03:48:47,940 --> 03:48:49,320
I'm so...

5722
03:48:49,320 --> 03:48:50,060
I'm so...

5723
03:48:50,060 --> 03:48:50,320
I'm so...

5724
03:48:50,320 --> 03:48:50,460
I'm so...

5725
03:48:50,460 --> 03:48:50,500
I'm so...

5726
03:48:50,500 --> 03:48:50,640
I'm so...

5727
03:48:50,640 --> 03:48:50,760
I'm so...

5728
03:48:52,580 --> 03:48:54,040
