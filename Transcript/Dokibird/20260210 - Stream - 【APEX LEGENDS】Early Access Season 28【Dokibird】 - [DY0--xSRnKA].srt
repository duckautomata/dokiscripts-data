a special video that was Just tweet it out.

9
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,720
Like, not, like, literally four minutes ago.

10
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,300
That was scheduled out.

11
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,940
All right, are you guys ready?

12
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,220
Apex Legends.

13
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,940
My name is Doki.

14
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,880
That's me!

15
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,660
I'm a YouTuber, primarily known for my FPS skills.

16
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,800
I'm RoboScarloot, and I created the skin for Watson with
Doki.

17
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,220
So, the Watson skin, it's basically me.

18
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,000
Like, they have my bandana there, my jacket.

19
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,840
And the best part is she's blonde.

20
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,580
I'm blonde.

21
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:24,640
I decided to pick some of the most obvious elements of
Loki's character presence on the skin, like the boots and

22
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,900
the straps, especially the specific belts that she has.

23
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,640
And also the one that I was really excited about was her
little tomato.

24
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,760
Oh yeah, by the way, we got the cut tomato.

25
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,440
I'm sorry.

26
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,260
That could kill this entire body.

27
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,400
He's like, the little tomato.

28
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,120
I'm so cute.

29
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:37,780
I'm sorry, guys.

30
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,380
It was a little, little rewarding.

31
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,680
The tomato got cut.

32
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,220
I really hope that people like the skin and the effort that
was put in.

33
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,400
It's just a really, really cool bounty hunter slash Western
aesthetic.

34
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,360
No, but we replaced it with someone things better and
terrorize the rank lobbies with Watson.

35
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,880
All right, okay, okay, okay.

36
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,000
No, the tomato got cut, but there was, there was a reason
for it.

37
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,240
All right.

38
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:57,760
All right.

39
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,340
Okay, look, look.

40
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,200
Okay, here, right here.

41
00:03:59,860 --> 00:03:59,940
All right.

42
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,140
Oh my God, where is it?

43
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,220
Where's the skin?

44
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,240
The scrap, especially the specific belts that she has.

45
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,340
No, it was a long interview.

46
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,100
It was like a 30 minute, it was like a 20 to 30 minute.

47
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:20,160
Okay, so to replace, we had to make a really tough decision
because they, uh, they forgot to do my ocee mark which was

48
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,620
the trophy the trophy mark so then uh we had to make the
because it was supposed to be on the ears of the watson so

49
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,600
we were running out of time so i was like just replace the
trophy ocee mark with the tomato because i felt like it

50
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:38,960
would be much much better so then you guys can like like um
you guys can like brandish the ocee mark as well when you're

51
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,780
playing watson so people be like oh that's that's you know
um their ocee is dokey bird so the ocee mark i felt the

52
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:51,680
ocean mark was much more important so it's gonna be a it's a
trophy on the patches instead of tomato it was a very tough

53
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:59,400
decision because like if the tomato was really inside me for
the tomato it was like it was like pretty her character is a

54
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:07,840
big cowboy old western look and i decided to keep that look
i really hope look on that way let me look it's me

55
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:29,590
i'm back baby i'm back on apex I'm literally in the game
it's literally me all right so the reason why um so yes we

56
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:37,350
are back in the basement oh my god it was so hard to keep
this a secret guys it was it was really really hard to keep

57
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:48,170
it a secret because it's been in the works for half a year
now and um I I when I got the the apex devs from respawn

58
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:55,710
that they wanted to include me in the seventh anniversary um
i was just like did you get the right person like because

59
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:01,990
like obviously you know i haven't been playing apex that
much recently in recent like years so i was just like so

60
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:08,390
surprised that they so went up to me and was like we really
want you on this seven year anniversary and um and they gave

61
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:14,010
me a skin too which is crazy because it's like what there's
a lot of things it's like a tracker there's like trackers

62
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:23,130
there's gun skins um there's uh there's stats and stuff or
like banners but and the skin the character skins is like

63
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:32,550
the most coveted spot for the anniversary and um so each
creator they choose uh a select they select uh uh pool of

64
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,870
creators uh like around 10 creators I believe like I think
it was like I don't remember how many creators it selected

65
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:47,670
for this year but it's usually around like six to not like
six to ten creators every year um and usually the the

66
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:55,770
character skins are the rarest ones to get because they're
like the most coveted position during the anniversary and

67
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:06,250
the fact that they gave me um a character skin and i get to
pick the character i wanted uh for my anniversary skin so i

68
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:13,910
personally picked watson for my character skin for the 7th
anniversary and the reason because if you guys know the

69
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:24,410
dokey bird lore watson was the first character i played that
got me apex predator um and uh in the in my first like the

70
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:30,210
first time i've ever got apex predator i played watson and
it was more so like it went in full circle so it was

71
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:38,810
dedicated to the character that i felt like took me to get
top 500 apex and back when I first started playing and the

72
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:46,890
fact that they let me be Watson I really appreciate a huge
shout out to the devs to the team for the entire experience

73
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:54,310
going through like designing the characters and everything
it felt like I was going through like a full circle I spent

74
00:07:54,310 --> 00:08:01,770
thousands of hours in this game a game that I dedicate
thousands of hours in and like that's me that's literally me

75
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:07,130
so the reason why I'm doing early access stream is that we
can actually see my skin in the early axis.

76
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,850
So let me boot it up real quick.

77
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,790
Let me boot up the game super quick.

78
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:19,750
But yes, that's why we're doing early axis because my skin
is actually in the game in early axis right now.

79
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,470
You guys can actually play as me.

80
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:28,230
I can like, you can go into lobbies and just wear my skin.

81
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,410
It's like insane to think about.

82
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,670
Yeah, I still can't believe it's so surreal.

83
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,210
that it's actually real.

84
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:42,510
I feel like I never ever thought that I would ever be picked
for the anniversary, especially like the newer like the

85
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,010
recent years as well.

86
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,610
So I like I'm just I'm just like speechless right now.

87
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,410
Like I have to keep this a secret for so long.

88
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:57,290
You can wear the Doki Bird skin suit.

89
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,350
Oh my god.

90
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,710
Also I did a little warm up.

91
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:05,610
I did like an hour warm up before then and I felt like so
clunky trying to play Apex again because it's been so long

92
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:11,690
since I've played like a movement shooter and oh my god like
there's so many new changes I didn't know but did you guys

93
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:18,110
know I was because I was practicing Watson but did you guys
know that the Watson fences don't destroy doors anymore I

94
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:26,690
was like oh my god like that's so strong yeah so like they
they changed so many things it's like it's like sort of a

95
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:32,070
whole new different game now yeah they don't for those who
have this is like the perfect time to come back to apex too

96
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:41,800
there's so many new changes and also the perfect time
because you can play as me uh i don't know when they change

97
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:50,820
that but there has been a lot of big changes there's been a
lot of changes in apex since i've last touched the game um

98
00:09:50,820 --> 00:10:06,000
all right that's me like dokey bird all right oh my gosh i'm

00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:20,640
elements whereas like it's Doki Bird but also like it's its

The Oshi mark.

113
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,120
So we swap the tomato.

114
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,280
Or the...

115
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,280
Yeah, this is an epic skin.

116
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,380
It's not even a legendary.

117
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,240
And then all the belts and everything.

118
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,000
And then the stars.

127
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:23,380
that was a that was a joke towards past retro dokey time era
when before before i like long time ago i usually did a lot

128
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:28,500
of high ends back then so it was like a time because it was
a time travel segment um there so i was just doing a little

129
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,060
throwback joke but like Yatus, guys.

130
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,340
Like, I'm still streaming.

131
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,260
Oh, my God, I'm a playable character.

132
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,480
We actually made it, guys.

133
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,900
We did it.

134
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,000
We made it.

135
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,100
Oh, I love the Oshi mark, too.

136
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:49,380
I love that, like, you know, you know, it's like a little
badge, like a little Boy Scout badge, you know?

137
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,420
They'd be like, yeah, that's my Oshi.

138
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,260
That's right.

139
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,080
I'm repting her.

140
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,700
Oh, sorry.

141
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,020
Okay.

142
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,080
Okay, sorry.

143
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:58,580
Um,

144
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:16,980
um but um it's it's it's so crazy it's it's so crazy to to
like see this like actually you know being in the game and

145
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:26,880
everything and like it felt like a full circle moment and um
like I didn't even thought this was going to happen, you

146
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:36,080
know, because it's not like, oh, like, it's already, um, I
felt like, you know, at this point in my career, like, um,

147
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:42,960
it was never really going to happen because I've, like,
obviously, I've, um, I haven't played Apex as much as I used

148
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,820
to in the past.

149
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:50,640
So it was, I was so shocked and surprised when the devs, um,
reached out to me and be like, do you want to be in our

150
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,400
seven year anniversary?

151
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:59,780
Like, do you want to have a cosmetic for the, seven-year
anniversary and it was so crazy it's i i did i was like are

152
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:10,760
you sure you sent it to the right person like but but like
it's like i really want to say thank you to the devs for

153
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:19,520
reaching out and like choosing me for this anniversary the
fact that they like acknowledged me as like someone

154
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:27,060
important in their community and history of the game to be
given the skin and it's like a played, by the way, seven

155
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:36,160
years ago, I started playing this game seven years ago, and
with my friends that like, ended up starting my VTuber

156
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:43,660
career, and was the reason why I was picked to join the
company in the first place, and like, this game literally

157
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:53,200
opened so many doors for me, um, and like, was the reason
why I started taking FPS games much more seriously in the

158
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,080
past, because, you know, in Overwatch, I just played Lucy.

159
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:04,520
and support but like here like here in apex i actually
focused on like playing like you know training my aim and

160
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:13,380
getting better at like you know getting better at like being
an aimer and like improving myself like like when for like

161
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:19,560
years and years trying to be better at like shooting my gun
and everything like tracking um tracking flicking and

162
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:27,280
everything and i have apex to thank for that um and it was
the game that sort of put my name uh in the vtubing

163
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:37,800
community so i really appreciate the devs for picking me and
for uh letting me be part of something really special um in

164
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:45,320
um in the game and it's it's crazy that i got a skin like a
cosmetic skin

165
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:58,660
to to think about like that this is actually real like i
thought this would never happen especially because like um

166
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:08,040
you know i have been playing a lot of i've been going more
variety to in my more recent career so um and it i guess it

167
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:15,860
revitalized my passion and love for apex that like no matter
what like i always come back to apex in the end and i always

168
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:21,060
like it was caused for me the basement is always calling for
me no matter what i feel like i sort i think i was the one

169
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,840
that started the apex basement joke being like come back to
the basement guys like

170
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:37,020
yeah and like i think i was one that sort of like started
the whole joke about like the basement and everything and

171
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:44,380
the people started using it was like oh no the basement the
apex basement you never truly leave the apex basement it

172
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:53,520
always calls you back um and it was a game that i got a lot
of people into as well uh and i know like a lot of dragoons

173
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,920
have talked to me and told me being like apex was the one to
introduce me like you were the one that introduced me to

174
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,280
apex like i love watching you taught me a lot about this
game when i first started streaming and everything so it is

175
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:13,580
a huge honor um uh and uh it is a huge honor to be

176
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:27,060
know a part of its history uh and yeah i hope to see a lot
of dragons wearing this watson skin to show that you know uh

177
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:34,360
to show their support because it's just it is a challenge so
um it is like easier to obtain because it's just like

178
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:44,620
challenges and stuff so you don't need to pay for uh you
don't really have to pay for it you can just um you can just

179
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:53,140
uh uh uh just like like complete challenges to get the skin
yourself um so here like some of the challenges that you can

180
00:17:53,140 --> 00:18:02,280
do and then you complete all these challenges you complete
all these challenges you will eventually get this yay and

181
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:10,260
apex comes out tomorrow uh the new season i believe comes
out tomorrow yes it's technically free because all you have

182
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:18,900
to do is just complete challenges and the more challenges
you get uh the more challenges you complete uh the obviously

183
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:25,880
like the more points you gain and then it'll end up getting
you the the uh this you know getting all these rewards and

184
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:35,700
stuff so this there's this and everything there's i think
this was greeks this one's greeks skin but all these are

185

00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:21,770
I was, like, playing pubs earlier to practice, because it's

267
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:22,170

00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:37,630
Okay.

276
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:42,070

279
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,350
But the rocket jump is fun.

280
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:51,510
Yeah, you know, I know you can super glide super easy
because it's literally an instruction on my screen, which

281
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,130
thankfully, I can sort.

282
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:53,810

00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:03,970
Octay?

290
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,330

291
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:08,810

292
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:09,950

302
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:08,810

00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:12,470

304
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:27,430
okay okay okay but if i you know i was i'm casually running
here like like it's a lot easier Okay, I had a feeling that

305
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,070
was gonna happen.

306
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:32,070
I feel like It's too fast.

307
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:33,350
It's too fast.

308
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:35,770
I'm so bad when it's too fast.

309
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:37,650
All right, what are my upgrades?

310
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,290
All right.

311
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:44,250
Minus 10, Sim Actor Landing from a Jump Pad.

312
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:45,370
That sounds okay.

313
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:46,710
I know what else.

314
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:54,150
Sim Search is longer with less as fast reloads with shield
crack.

315
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:10,110
all right do i stim oh my god i do i can go so fast oh my
god okay all right and then the other one was just taking

316
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:21,510
less hp oh my god literally like regent all the hp that i
used wait everyone gets it too that is so strong okay now i

317
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,990
think i gotta i gotta practice octane

318
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:35,670
oh my god wait that's actually insane yeah the speed is
crazy okay but then like when you're too fast you can't

319
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:43,270
really aim guys you gotta remember that like i think like
you're too fast unless you have a controller it gets really

320
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:53,210
hard to aim guys it gets really hard to track when you go
too fast you know it's a little it's the exchange yeah who

321
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:57,650
needs aim when you can fly The cost of being too fast.

322
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,950
like, I can see someone doing that shit.

323
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,570
Being like...

324
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,830
I need to find some ammo.

325
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:05,270
Okay.

326
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:08,310
We need to aim with the skill issue, Doki.

327
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,190
Just a little skill issue.

328
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:10,970
What else, guys?

329
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,210
What else is new?

330
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,750
We still have, like, 30 minutes to look through all the new
stuff.

331
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:19,310
I get so overwhelmed if I go too fast.

332
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,710
I didn't...

333
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,830
I get weak.

334
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:24,630
No wonder.

335
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:25,750
No wonder I see everyone playing.

336
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:26,650
this character.

337
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,930
Can do sideway ults now.

338
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,370
Has she always been able to do sideway ults?

339
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,070
You can rotate it, I'm pretty sure.

340
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,570
Oh yeah, Valk.

341
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,710
We can turn down the game sound a bit.

342
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:41,450
Alright, sure.

343
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,830
Alright, I'll turn down the game sound a little bit.

344
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,950
Alright, I know, no, Valk is crazy.

345
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:54,130
Okay, so, because, like, one of my friends, because I was
playing with my friends, and one of my friends, um, let's

346
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:54,430
see.

347
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:55,610
Where's Valk?

348
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:05,030
oh my gosh just how little I play Valc I do not play her
because I can't bunny hop with her I don't like playing Valc

349
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:14,150
because because I love bunny hopping and I can't bunny hop
when I have Valc on because she just does her little fly so

350
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:22,370
that's why I never play Valc but it's crazy because I didn't
know if this like okay minus 5 second and was a real okay so

351
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:31,750
this because like you know it's been a while since I came
back so um so the crazy part was that i didn't realize they

352
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:38,650
reworked some of her perks as well uh and like this perk is
crazy i don't know when this perk was reworked but it was

353
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:47,450
not there when i was playing it and and then like this all
launchers players much faster now and it was insane because

354
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:58,010
when you up it's so fast okay oops it's crazy because i can
attract people like it where people are in buildings now.

355
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:05,390
So like, if there's like people in the building, the alt can
look, can find them in buildings.

356
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:10,450
So I was like not, I was like very surprised about that.

357
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,070
Yeah.

358
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,370
So when you're in the sky, but it's a perk, by the way.

359
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,050
It's this perk.

360
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:17,050
I'm just revealing and through walls.

361
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:17,930
Through walls.

362
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,870
This perk is old.

363
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:28,310
Not, okay, it's old for some people, but some people might
have not been able to, recently so like for me that was new

364
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:38,270
it was a new perk for me because I I didn't remember this I
know that but like for those who haven't who you know took a

365
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:43,050
break from apex and are coming back tomorrow you're like
some of the things that you might not have been able might

366
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:53,090
not know about lately that has got changed over the last
couple of months Maggie runs faster with yeah Valk clearly

367
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:53,710
has was.

368
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:54,370
It's insane.

369
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,030
What was it?

370
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:55,370
What else?

371
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,750
What are changes for this season, guys?

372
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:05,610
But those are the changes I noticed that I've never seen
before, uh, until, until like, yes, today.

373
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:14,370
Cal is tactical is better, bigger now.

374
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:15,790
Okay, where's Cat is this?

375
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:17,670
I'm low on ammo.

376
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,210
Should find some more.

377
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:20,690
Yeah, I can flip it.

378
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,590
Oh, the flip is easy.

379
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:23,290
I like the flip.

380
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,090
Is it taller?

381
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:35,070
I feel like it was never this tall before, right?

382
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,690
Wait, this feels taller.

383
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,750
I feel like it's a lot.

384
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,250
You can break windows.

385
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:49,410
Where is a window?

386
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:51,550
Oh, what?

even know which one would scoopy good uh i would say this

417
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:08,690
and then attack activates faster minus five quote percent
double duration attack double duration attacks full body i

Yeah.

421
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,770
That all seemed like I had it for a while, too.

422
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,790
They buffed wall climbing during ult?

423
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:34,330

Alright, let's let's get my ult real fast.

425
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,640
It feels a lot faster, for sure.

426
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,600
Let's see.

427
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,860
Oh, I don't have any mag here.

428
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,500
1 or 2 seconds.

429
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,020
Wait, where are the people?

430
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,300
Hit.

431
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,200
14.

432
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,800
I don't think it increases.

433
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Did I got the wrong person?

434
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,660
Yeah, no, it's the same.

435
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,500
But the alt is...

436
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,580
The alt is very...

437
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,180
Very long.

438
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,540
The ult seems to...

439
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,380
Oh, it doesn't work in fire range.

440
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:29,420
But the ult does seem very long when I boot it up.

441
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,460
Knocks don't happen.

442
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,240
Oh, I have to wait till the knock.

443
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:33,960
I see.

444
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:36,760
That's...

445
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,280
I see.

446
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:37,680
Yeah.

447
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:41,000
But it looks like the ult is longer than what I'm used to.

448
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,280
But you can make it even longer.

449
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:45,500
I don't know.

450
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,560
It feels a lot longer.

451
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,040
I swear.

452
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:50,700
Bloodhound did not have an alteration that long before when
I used to play.

453
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,080
Uh, what else?

454
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:54,500
What else?

455
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,920

00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,480
All right, go, my bird.

460
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,920
Bang smoke on doors.

461
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:10,980
What does that mean?

462
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,260

00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,060
Oh, she has unlimited ammo as a perk.

511
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:09,080
I know they reworked a lot of perks, too.

512
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,520
Bigger ammo stacks, extra.

513
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:11,760
Oops, that's not what I wanted.

514
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,660
Bastarillo and Infinite ammo.

515
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,740
Wow, behind Amp Shield.

516
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:19,780
Excuse me?

517
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:24,210
Wait, is that not the Amp Shield?

518
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:26,910
Wait, did I not get that?

519
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:28,710
Okay, Amp Cover will regenerate.

520
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:30,070
Improve Shield of Hand.

521
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:30,710
Okay, wait.

522
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:35,650
Faster reloads and Infinite went behind.

523
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:38,290
Amp Cover and Amp Shield is intact.

524
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:40,110
How do I get the Infinite Ammo?

525
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:42,890
Unless this is the Infinite Ammo they're talking about.

526
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:45,610
I need to...

527
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:47,050
Oh, I need to put new walls up.

528
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:47,810
Okay, don't worry.

529
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:49,110
Alright.

530
00:44:50,390 --> 00:45:03,350
out of here okay i'm building my new home all right this is
my do i need ammo first i'm low on ammo okay i need one

531
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:09,450
stack okay i will test this out yeah i'm just remodeling
real quick

532
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:23,220
i'll put one stack and see if it works oh my god there you
go i have to have one stack already okay that's pretty cool

533
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:37,620
that's a pretty neat change yeah alright anything else guys
anything else that they changed oh it's almost time it's

534
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:45,560
almost time to game it's almost time to queue up with all
the other creators can you build my oh yeah the reload is

535
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:56,700
insane too yeah you need to have well no I had like I'm
pretty sure like had like, uh, one, like, one mag, um, in

536
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:01,700
my, uh, vault, and it didn't let me, it didn't let me have
infinite reload.

537
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:03,380
Look, okay, see?

538
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:07,820
I don't know, maybe, or maybe it just took a, I had to grab
new ammo.

539
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:11,340
Horizon has a drone she can fly.

540
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,260
Oh, wait, never mind.

541
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:14,480
I just had, I guess I had to grab new ammo.

542
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,240
It doesn't work with old ammo.

543
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,280
Oh yeah, it doesn't, it doesn't work with old ammo.

544
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:33,520
okay horizon can glide now all right what's this we're back
you missed this another we picked me up i guess it's a perk

545
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:43,400
right another soft landing all right an air to fast fall
after a press oh that's new what else soft landing ground

546
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:52,940
shield region gain extra ability charge on knock i feel like
oh my god i don't even know which one would be good.

547
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:58,100
If you're super aggressive, knock expert would be great.

548
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:02,820
If you're super aggressive.

549
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:08,220
Right?

550
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:15,370
They're both so strong.

551
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,090
Yeah, the knock is bad.

552
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:21,430
Yeah, I was going to say, I feel like the knock would be
better if you're a super aggressive player because then you

553
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:22,750
didn't have your Q again.

554
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:24,010
Super, you didn't have your Q.

555
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:27,770
But then if we were like, worry about like sustained, then I
guess like...

556
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:30,150
Other for the shield regen.

557
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:37,470
I feel like this would be better if you're just like an
aggressive player But I want to know how's that We

558
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:49,110
This is a redeploy this is like what the fuck I'm literally
redeploying I

559
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:57,550
Oh my god, I can literally oh my god went all the way here.

560
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:02,670
I was over Wait a minute, wait a minute, I'm actually, I'm
actually flying.

561
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:05,930
Uh, they nerfed that by the way.

562
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:11,770
I was mad at their, oh my god, the fact that this is a, wee.

563
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:19,030
I'm all the way here.

564
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:22,850
Oh my god, I'm across the map.

565
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:27,130
How strong, how, how strong was this before?

566
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:38,510
where did this go to where that's the nerd version how far
did i go to like i i use this in king's canyon and then i'm

567
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:45,550
in olympus is that how it was before i was like we in king's
canyon and suddenly i'm in olympus like

568
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:55,950
now we horizon rotating now and yes

569
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:09,650
you can release and read up wait that's so true wait a
minute let's try this if you tap it gives you what if I tap

570
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:23,650
it occasionally so I'll be like we oh my god you're right
and wait you're right wait you're right okay if I do it

571
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:30,810
correctly I can actually go further that's crazy I have to
just have it This is some new-ass tech that I'm learning,

572
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:31,030
right?

573
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:32,810
Okay, now I don't even know what to play.

574
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:36,350
All these characters are so fun, yeah.

575
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:42,190
Yeah, because, like, she gets, like, a little bit of hype.

576
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:45,650
I just don't know the tech, I just don't know the timing for
the tap.

577
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:49,230
I need to figure out the timing to tap it.

578
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:54,230
I think if I tap it correctly, I could go crazy with this.

579
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:56,570
I could literally rotate into a different map.

580
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:03,770
I could be on the other side, and then the ring is closing,
and I could go to the other side of the ring.

581
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:07,430
Alright, what else?

582
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:08,770
Is there anything else?

583
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:11,050
Yeah, I know about their passive.

584
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:12,090
They changed their passive?

585
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:13,170
I actually don't know.

586
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:17,170
Increases arrow, control, and reduces fall impact.

587
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:19,510
Anyone's passive got changed?

588
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:24,850
Octane.

589
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:25,330
Oh, I know.

590
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:28,790
I saw it, but I tried to octane caustic.

591
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:38,690
causing damage with gas opening death box opening death
boxes really okay uh i didn't realize opening death boxes

592
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:49,130
though now too six canister reinforced hard light zone
overcharge how is caustic op that was enlightening it

593
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:58,150
doesn't seem that what did he change other than this opening
death boxes yeah you can have all perks on him oh my god

594
00:50:58,150 --> 00:51:04,630
what are his perks i forgot about the perks all tactical
charge re okay that one i remember i remember when i did the

595
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:15,050
hide-and-seek tournament regen hp inside yeah i remember
that and then one plus this one was strong i remember he

596
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:27,850
takes damage faster now we're charged 300 faster inside the
gas plus 50 okay i feel like that's crazier how far is this

597
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:31,510
My vision is clear.

598
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:32,770
Okay, I'm still in it.

599
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:34,250
Oh, my God.

600
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:37,010
Okay, I can literally control an entire zone.

601
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:37,990
How about this?

602
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:41,390
300%.

603
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:45,370
Nades on...

604
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:46,670
Okay, did they change?

605
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:49,770
I remember last time played, I didn't realize Nade gets rid
of gases.

606
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:50,890
Is that still the same?

607
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:52,430
Or did they change that?

608
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:56,290
I remember because I was like, Oh, my God, it's so long.

609
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:00,370
Okay, my...

610
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:06,390
gas thing goes away but like but like does it destroy my gas
ult though

611
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:19,410
still the same what about my ult does it destroy my ult or
yeah all right i remember that i didn't realize that was a

612
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:25,810
change because i could have got more kills during the hot
and sea i i could have got more kills during hot and sea if

613
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:28,390
i didn't through my ult and then 20 names

614
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:32,430
All right, let's see.

615
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:38,010
Oh, yeah, it does.

616
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:39,990
Yeah, the gas is gone.

617
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:41,590
Imagine.

618
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:47,650
Oh, it temporarily disperses.

619
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:48,270
Oh, okay.

620
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:49,190
It's still back there.

621
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:50,910
It's just the cans are gone.

622
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:51,410
Never mind.

623
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:53,710
It temporary disperses only.

624
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:57,210
I still...

625
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:59,310
Yeah, but I could have killed the entire lobby.

626
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:00,130
Guys.

627
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:03,010
It could have been an entire lobby.

628
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:11,450
Yeah, it's any Nade, but for your ult, you have to But then
you have to nade yourself, though.

629
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:12,470
That's the thing.

630
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:18,230
If you're ulted And then you try to throw a nade to disperse
the gas, you're nading yourself.

631
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:20,090
So, like, it's like a sacrifice.

632
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:22,370
You want to take damage From your own nade?

633
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:23,950
Or, like,

634
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:27,730
Yeah.

635
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:33,670
all can go through walls now?

636
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:34,530
No way.

637
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:38,250
Is it really?

638
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:42,310
Alright, where's where's a building?

639
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:47,560
Oh yeah.

640
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:48,600
Wait, you're right.

641
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,320
I got hit here.

642
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,860
Yo, can charge the bow.

643
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:56,960
Can take similar scopes.

644
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,340
Oh my god, they brought that back.

645
00:53:58,420 --> 00:53:59,540
That shit was so broken.

646
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:02,320
That's how I got Apex Brady.

647
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,620
I'll abuse the fuck out of G7 and charge rifle.

648
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,340
Right click for breach mode.

649
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:13,740
Oh, use right click?

650
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:15,000
I'm nearly empty.

651
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:16,400
Okay.

652
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,360
Let me try.

653
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:19,940
I'll grab more.

654
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:21,620
Oh yeah, I need to do this again.

655
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,120
Alt creates jump near tactic.

656
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:31,060
I saw the unlimited ammo on Krayber.

657
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:32,300
I saw that unlimited ammo works.

658
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,560
on red guns, which is scary.

659
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:35,780
I also had that.

660
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:42,160
I also actually had the perk, wow, with the creeper, like,
when I was practicing an hour before stream.

661
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,400
Breach mode.

662
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:46,780
What the fuck?

663
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:47,980
I'm breaching?

664
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,180
Oh, shit.

665
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,080
Oh, shit.

666
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,420
Wait, that's... Oh, my god.

667
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,160
That's crazy.

668
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:57,620
Alternator can double tap?

669
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:58,860
What does that even mean?

670
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,300
There's so many new chains

671
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:07,350
What do you mean?

672
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:08,850
Alternator can double tap.

673
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:11,870
What does that mean?

674
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:13,150
There's no alternator.

675
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:19,910
Yeah, I can clean the whole floor now.

676
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,020
What do you mean by double tap?

677
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,960
Fire's two quick shots per trigger pull.

678
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:32,260
Cannot be removed?

679
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:38,070
Is it?

680
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:41,310
Oh, meet the upgrade.

681
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:41,770
Oh!

682
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:48,770
Two shots per trigger pulled.

683
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:58,380
I don't see that working.

684
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,060
Oh, press B.

685
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:02,740
Oh, there it is.

686
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:03,560
I see it now.

687
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:05,380
Oh, okay.

688
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:05,920
I see it.

689
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,900
I didn't...

690
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,360
Oh, my God.

691
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:17,420
Oh, my God.

692
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:18,400
Oh, my God.

693
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:26,700
That seems like a, yeah, it's...

694
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:28,600
I'm trying to like...

695
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:34,270
Oh my god.

696
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:40,270
Okay, that's...

697
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:41,130
Seems strong.

698
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:48,430
It is, yeah, two bullets, slower, but two bullets, so two is
better than one.

699
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:51,250
Two might be better than one.

700
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:54,170
That's no range.

701
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:54,730
Let's see.

702
00:56:57,950 --> 00:57:05,970
if you can control your recoil but then you can't really get
headshots g7 wait what time is it oh two more minutes all

703
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:21,240
right let's check the g7 g7 wait it's in sniper where's my
g7 at wait where did it oh they put it as oh my god it's

704
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:29,840
been so young oh okay i put as a red gun oh It's a care
package gun.

705
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,540
Okay, that's interesting.

706
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:32,600
All right, let's put a...

707
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,580
Apparently you can put a sniper scope now.

708
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:36,860
So...

709
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:38,360
Oh, where is it?

710
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:39,340
2x4.

711
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:42,840
I mean, 2x4 is really pretty crazy.

712
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,380
Where the fuck is the sniper stuff?

713
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:48,680
Oh, fuck it.

714
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,620
This is why they removed sniper scope.

715
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:58,340
I don't know if you guys remember.

716
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,360
But they...

717
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:00,440
They removed...

718
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,280
Dirk.

719
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:03,900
Um...

720
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,340
This is how I got Apex Predator.

721
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,420
She's in...

722
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:08,280
Is how...

723
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,760
That in Charge Rifle is how I got Apex Predator.

724
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:11,380
I literally just...

725
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,360
Put a sniper scout on my G7.

726
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,860
And then just farm the shit of people for...

727
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:18,440
For RP.

728
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:20,940
Like that shit is so broken.

729
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,340
At least it's a care package weapon though.

730
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:23,920
You know?

731
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:27,380
At least we have that.

732
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:27,680
Yeah.

733
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:28,180
Yeah.

734
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,120
They brought it back.

735
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,540
But it's a care package, so it's harder to...

736
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:33,400
Usually I do this.

737
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:39,580
I was so good at, like, back then, when I played this game
every day, I was so good at, like, hip-firing, too.

738
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:40,320
I would do this.

739
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:44,120
I would hip-fire G7 for close range, because it was so
strong.

740
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:46,120
Like, I would do this.

741
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:47,900
If I get pushed.

742
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,880
Like, a G7.

743
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:54,620
Yeah.

744
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:55,900
It was really good.

745
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:56,880
It was...

746
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,320
And now they can have unlimited ammo.

747
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,100
Oh my gosh, it's time.

748
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:01,980
It's time, guys.

749
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:02,940
It's time!

750
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,000
We gotta queue up!

751
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:09,220
Leave it as is.

752
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:14,720
I guess it's...

753
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,920
I think wildcard is later, but for now you can play...

754
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:19,900
You can play unranked.

755
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,480
Oh my gosh, it's time, the game!

756
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:24,320
Oh!

757
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,020
I don't know what to play.

758
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:38,900
every all the characters I want your first one would be I
think first one definitely for sure Watson to celebrate I

Alright, I need to put...

Let me...

765
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:44,060
I need to put my Padawine skin on here.

766
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:44,960
Where is it?

767
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:45,680
There you go.

768
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:47,780
It's not my usual one, but...

769
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:48,700
I don't remember what it's called.

770
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:51,020
It was the Ice one, I'm pretty sure.

771
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:53,040
The Ice one was my favorite.

772
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:56,120
Here you go.

773
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:56,980
That's my usual.

774
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:01,220
And then, I guess I should do the Wingman, too, just in
case.

775
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:02,960
Where is it?

776
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:03,860
It is Sniper.

777
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:05,320
Wait.

778
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:06,580

god all those years crying about crying about apex legends

790
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:11,780
getting stream sniped during ring grinds getting apex
predator all those years it led me to this moment I never

791
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:18,820
thought I was gonna get an anniversary skin I thought like
you know it was already past my peak my prime when I used to

792
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:27,500
like my my peak apex era I was like oh they will never
choose me and the fact that they did let me be part of apex

793
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:40,880
history being part of the apex history and and celebration
uh I made it I actually made it that's why last year when

794
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:47,420
you guys were like oh what goals do you want to do for your
uh new year's resolution and i was like it's so hard to

are happening in 2026 and like i can't spoil it but you know

796
01:03:54,360 --> 01:04:00,140

That's a cartwheel.

827
01:08:32,670 --> 01:08:34,710
Yeah, see, the fake dokey can't do that.

828
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:36,650
All she's doing is just looking left and right.

829
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:41,050
Oh, boss, but you know the real dokey.

830
01:08:41,070 --> 01:08:43,490
Doki doesn't know her cardinal direction.

831
01:08:43,930 --> 01:08:46,530
She can't tell from her front and back, guys.

832
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:48,110
Checkmate.

833
01:08:49,150 --> 01:08:49,690
You know that.

834
01:08:49,730 --> 01:08:51,990
You know the real Doki doesn't follow instructions.

835
01:08:52,930 --> 01:08:53,930
It's a 50-50.

836
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:55,670
I follow it partially.

837
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:00,490
That's right.

838
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:05,150

Oh, what?

853
01:10:56,540 --> 01:10:58,240
Oh, he's fighting already.

854
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:02,060
I'm gonna say, that's fast.

855
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:03,620
Where the fuck is he?

856
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:06,720
We're just...

857
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,140
We were on a break!

858
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,600
Oh, he's fine.

859
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:12,460
It was just one guy.

860
01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:17,730
Wait, am I lagging?

861
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:19,450
I can fix this, don't worry.

862
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:20,770
Am I?

863
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:23,110
Can't tell.

864
01:11:25,010 --> 01:11:25,950
It's not you, it's me.

865
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:29,490
I'm fine.

866
01:11:33,190 --> 01:11:35,890
I want an R9 though.

867
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:40,690
I need an R9.

868
01:11:44,030 --> 01:11:45,230
Just a little bit?

869
01:11:46,270 --> 01:11:55,050
I don't have to fix it, but before I do, I need to see a
hundred and oh, I'll grab the carbine.

870
01:11:55,150 --> 01:11:56,890
I heard carbine is good now.

871
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:03,120
You see it?

872
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:04,320
Alright, I can fix that.

873
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:05,340
I'll fix it.

874
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:11,020
Who's doing streamer mode in that early access?

875
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:11,940
Like

876
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,180
streamer mode in early access.

877
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:18,960
It's crazy.

878
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:24,040
Oh, what the fuck?

879
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:25,220
I thought I got a 3x.

880
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:27,560
Oh, no, that's not a 3x.

881
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:29,400
Still need an R9.

882
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:33,940
I'll go over to horse-adjacent demon, whoever he is.

883
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,940
Whatever this guy is.

884
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:40,700
I just feel like this is better.

885
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:42,460
I should select an upgrade.

886
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,320
I believe this upgrade will...

887
01:12:51,990 --> 01:12:52,550
Wee!

888
01:12:54,230 --> 01:12:54,790
Amanda!

889
01:12:55,130 --> 01:12:57,630
How could you not know where's the chase a demon?

890
01:12:59,130 --> 01:13:00,830
He's known around these parts.

891
01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:04,650
Oh my god, see there's the windows.

892
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:09,640
Oh my god, nice.

893
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,300
Okay, I gotta find a lot of light ammo, though.

894
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:15,820
That's the risk I'm willing.

895
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:17,340
That's not gonna bite me in the ass.

896
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:19,860
Obviously, everything will be fine.

897
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:23,180
I would definitely find enough light ammo.

898
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:24,900
I'm not gonna run out, I believe.

899
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,400
I'm not gonna run out, right?

900
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:30,520
Oh my god.

901
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:31,160
Okay, there you go.

902
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:31,760
Another stat.

903
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:33,880
Is he fighting someone?

904
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:40,130
Grab that.

905
01:13:41,030 --> 01:13:41,590
Oh, shit.

906
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:42,230
There is enemies.

907
01:13:43,550 --> 01:13:43,830
Don't worry.

908
01:13:43,950 --> 01:13:44,670
I'm gonna head over.

909
01:13:45,330 --> 01:13:45,890
I'm flanking.

910
01:13:46,990 --> 01:13:47,830
Don't worry.

911
01:13:48,010 --> 01:13:48,570
I'll help.

912
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:52,070
And I'm gonna get, like, the fucking double, like,
two-timed.

913
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:56,840
Gone already?

914
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:00,500
You're right.

915
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,940
I just, as long as I have infinite ammo, it'll be fine.

916
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:07,930
That's right.

917
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:11,650
I don't know why I planted it there.

918
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:13,250
Don't worry, it's going to help us, guys.

919
01:14:13,430 --> 01:14:13,850
Watch this.

920
01:14:14,970 --> 01:14:16,830
This is going to help us in the long run.

921
01:14:19,110 --> 01:14:21,310
Oh, he's using it to rocket jump.

922
01:14:22,310 --> 01:14:23,630
Oh, that's smart.

923
01:14:23,950 --> 01:14:25,030
The movement tech.

924
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:29,420
Wait, what?

925
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:31,880
There's people here.

926
01:14:35,670 --> 01:14:36,030
Okay.

927
01:14:36,050 --> 01:14:38,290
I hear them.

928
01:14:47,810 --> 01:14:48,710

929
01:14:50,030 --> 01:14:51,590

It's okay, we're saved?

932
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:13,050
No, bro pushed actually way too far.

933
01:15:13,630 --> 01:15:13,930
For real.

934
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:18,640
That's right!

935
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:19,460
Double fence!

936
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:20,980
Oh shit.

937
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:26,370
Are you serious?

938
01:15:29,370 --> 01:15:42,290
Okay, we gotta Oh my god, didn't reload Fuck Oh, no, I'm

Okay, you know what?

940
01:15:44,010 --> 01:15:57,490
I did more than my Oh, it's controller Look, in the end I
did the most damage I'm not washed Not washed Because I did

941
01:15:57,490 --> 01:15:58,430
the most damage.

942
01:15:58,950 --> 01:16:00,050
That's all I'm going to say.

943
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:01,810
And I joined the fight.

944
01:16:06,290 --> 01:16:06,650
Real.

945
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:07,910
Not washed.

946
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:10,270
These guys, they might play like every day.

947
01:16:10,830 --> 01:16:12,290
But I got the most damage.

948
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:14,310
That's all that matters.

949
01:16:17,850 --> 01:16:19,250
Not washed, guys.

950
01:16:19,770 --> 01:16:20,590
Not washed.

951
01:16:23,710 --> 01:16:24,230
Exactly.

952
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:26,430
That's all that matters.

953
01:16:26,450 --> 01:16:27,010
matters.

954
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:29,890
That's all that matters, guys.

955
01:16:30,510 --> 01:16:31,270
How the fuck?

956
01:16:31,690 --> 01:16:31,690
Okay.

957
01:16:33,050 --> 01:16:34,970

They got... They actually got, like, a good... A good stack.

961
01:16:43,790 --> 01:16:46,090
I'm still... Guys, I hit my shots.

962
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:46,910
You saw that.

963
01:16:47,050 --> 01:16:52,990
I almost... You said if I had reloaded my second gun,
wouldn't it would have been fucking dead.

964
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:58,110
And I didn't die first.

965
01:16:58,390 --> 01:17:01,230
My first, the teammate that died first was being stupid.

966
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:02,370
You saw him.

967
01:17:02,690 --> 01:17:04,150
He fucking ran in the open.

968
01:17:04,290 --> 01:17:05,550
Like, what are you doing, bro?

969
01:17:06,850 --> 01:17:08,330
That's in your regular pub.

970
01:17:08,430 --> 01:17:09,930
There's no casual players in here.

971
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:11,530
These are all content creators.

972
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:18,930
What are you doing?

973
01:17:19,630 --> 01:17:20,950
And I knew I had to play it.

974
01:17:21,010 --> 01:17:22,770
I had to be smart about it.

975
01:17:27,450 --> 01:17:29,770
Oh, Doki would so...

976
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:31,630
No, I'm not talking about horse-adjacent demon.

977
01:17:31,770 --> 01:17:32,990
I'm talking about the third guy.

978
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:34,170
Where the fuck he was?

979
01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:36,050
His...

980
01:17:36,050 --> 01:17:38,530
He was so unimportant to me.

981
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:41,530
He didn't matter to me that I don't even know what his name
was.

982
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:43,010
I didn't even know who he was.

983
01:17:43,410 --> 01:17:45,170
I just knew about horse-adjacent demon.

984
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:47,210
You're right.

985
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:49,210
Retro-Doki would have every one.

986
01:17:58,600 --> 01:17:59,540
Oh, my God.

987
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:00,760
That's a while, though.

988
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:01,360
How long?

989
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:02,280
I'm going to check how long.

990
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:11,860
servers are going up for okay it's two hours at least that's
good the fuse thing is so looks so fun i think the fuse or

991
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:17,760
horizon looks really fun i want to try fuse or horizon for
the next one

992
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:30,130
have to be smart didn't reload okay look it was like in the
okay i was getting jumped okay i was fucking getting jumped

993
01:18:34,150 --> 01:18:39,590
the rising any changes i don't know if the changes are
recent but to me they're are new, you know?

994
01:18:40,130 --> 01:18:42,150
It's new to me type deal.

995
01:18:43,190 --> 01:18:45,310
That's some... Guys, these guys have been playing for seven
years.

996
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:46,510
I hope they can beam.

997
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:48,930
You know?

998
01:18:49,130 --> 01:18:50,630
Okay, I don't know what the fuck this guy.

999
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:57,110
That guy is stupid for, like, uh, fight, like, fighting like
that, but, like, I hope they can beam.

1000
01:18:57,630 --> 01:19:02,370
Literally, they've been playing for, like, seven years,
like, non-stop.

1001
01:19:02,650 --> 01:19:03,310
These players?

1002
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:06,790
If you can't...

1003
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:14,280
Let me guess.

1004
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:15,320
You're an Aries.

1005
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,080
I think some people are three-stacking because you can horse
and chase and turkey.

1006
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:23,240
Nitro, thank you for the super chat.

1007
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:27,740
They, I'm pretty sure, like, some of these players are...

1008
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:33,400
You can stack in early access as long as, like, the players
have each other in their friends list.

1009
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:36,000
So you can technically stack in early access.

1010
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:38,340
So I won't be surprised.

1011
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:45,820
As long as, like, you have their...

1012
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:47,740
Like, you know, obviously you have...

1013
01:19:53,450 --> 01:19:54,850
Yeah, but why don't you just solo?

1014
01:19:55,570 --> 01:19:57,070
Because this is a big moment, you know?

1015
01:19:58,110 --> 01:20:00,110
This is, like, a big moment for us.

1016
01:20:00,570 --> 01:20:08,910
I felt like this is a good time to, like, solo and just
celebrate a moment of me fucking actually being in the game.

1017
01:20:13,650 --> 01:20:16,390
I want to, like, celebrate it with all of you guys.

1018
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:21,090
You guys didn't expect it, did you?

1019
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:23,270
I wouldn't have expected out of it.

1020
01:20:23,470 --> 01:20:24,710
No, not Broken Moon.

1021
01:20:25,250 --> 01:20:25,270
No!

1022
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:29,230
I'm not a huge fan of Broken Moon.

1023
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:37,500
Don't worry.

1024
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:39,280
I didn't expect it out of it.

1025
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:46,360
I thought I was going to get, like, a tracker or, like, a
Gunskin.

1026
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:47,740
I would have...

1027
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:49,720
I think it would have been cool to get Gunskin as well.

1028
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:51,940
Because then, like, everyone...

1029
01:20:51,940 --> 01:20:53,980
No one has to fight for the Watson, you know?

1030
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,480
I want to try...

1031
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:57,320
I want to try...

1032
01:20:57,340 --> 01:21:13,140
uh i'll try horizon actually i'll try horizon but like uh
but like like i said i wanted to like i thought watson was

1033
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:19,080
such a special character to me because like i said i
couldn't have got apex predator without watch like without

1034
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:25,760
playing watson at that time like i literally played watson
for my for my rank stacks for it and she's such a special

1035
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:28,840
character to me because she was the character I got my first
top 500 on.

1036
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:37,480
So I'm really happy that I'm really happy for that
opportunity.

1037
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:42,900
And the fact that, you know, you can have the Oshi mark is
there too.

1038
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:45,440
So you know, like, you know, who your Oshi is.

1039
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:50,240
And that the skin also works as a non-Youtuber skin too.

1040
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:55,780
My second option would have been an R9 skin.

1041
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,160
An R9 gun skin.

1042
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:02,780
because it is my, you know, R9 was my go-to gun when I
grinded rank.

1043
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:04,340
It was my, it's my best gun.

1044
01:22:04,660 --> 01:22:06,400
It's always been my best weapon.

1045
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,020
Ah, fuck.

1046
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:16,460
Holy fuck, no gun, really?

1047
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:21,610
Oh my god.

1048
01:22:21,810 --> 01:22:22,790
I'm not worried to hell.

1049
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:28,900
Where is he?

1050
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,120
There we go.

1051
01:22:39,140 --> 01:22:39,660
Okay.

1052
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,400
Okay, you know, I'm like, are these real players?

1053
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:47,660
I'm trying to remember that these are all real players.

1054
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:56,420
Oh my god, they broke my window.

1055
01:22:58,180 --> 01:22:59,180
Yeah, that's a thing.

1056
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:02,160
It actually broke my window.

1057
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:14,340
where is he what oh

1058
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:32,580

1060
01:23:44,740 --> 01:23:45,700
Oh my god.

1061
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:47,500
I can't glide yet.

1062
01:23:57,990 --> 01:23:58,470
No!

1063
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:02,250
I couldn't.

1064
01:24:02,350 --> 01:24:03,430
I didn't have chest.

1065
01:24:03,570 --> 01:24:04,150
Okay, look.

1066
01:24:05,890 --> 01:24:07,510
I felt like I was 1v3ing.

1067
01:24:07,530 --> 01:24:08,170
Not gonna lie.

1068
01:24:08,290 --> 01:24:09,050
I really did.

1069
01:24:13,070 --> 01:24:14,590
I felt like I was...

1070
01:24:14,590 --> 01:24:17,410
I felt like I personally was 1v3ing this.

1071
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:18,230
I will say.

1072
01:24:21,290 --> 01:24:21,770
You...

1073
01:24:25,450 --> 01:24:45,150
Not gonna lie Yeah Two kills Fast turkey would have won the
133 With a hemlock Two I will say Definitely Were I was like

01:24:45,150 --> 01:24:50,610

like it It really didn't I

1075
01:24:54,450 --> 01:24:57,410
Oh, turkey ghost done that.

1076
01:24:57,490 --> 01:24:57,890
You know what?

1077
01:24:58,650 --> 01:24:58,910
All right.

1078
01:24:59,290 --> 01:24:59,930
That's it.

1079
01:25:00,250 --> 01:25:01,530
I'm bringing it out.

1080
01:25:03,410 --> 01:25:04,290
I'm bringing it out.

1081
01:25:08,370 --> 01:25:09,150
It's time.

1082
01:25:11,950 --> 01:25:13,810
All right, I'm pulling out my power level.

1083
01:25:16,550 --> 01:25:17,410
It's happening.

1084
01:25:18,650 --> 01:25:19,510
Bring it out.

1085
01:25:23,630 --> 01:25:25,710
We're going back in time.

1086
01:25:26,450 --> 01:25:28,690
We're going to prime doki era.

1087
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:34,460
Let's go.

1088
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,700
I'm going super saiyan.

1089
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:39,500
Why is everyone playing Catalyst?

1090
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:40,880
Is Catalyst that strong, chat?

1091
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:44,220
Is Catalyst that strong?

1092
01:25:46,580 --> 01:25:47,300
She's...

1093
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:50,360
To the time where I wasn't washed.

1094
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:53,720
This is it.

1095
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:02,180
I think, oh my god, 22 players in queue.

1096
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:03,680
The queue is so long, though.

1097
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,360
Her queues are huge.

1098
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:11,360
Is it really?

1099
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:14,360
Alright, we'll try Fuse and Cadillus.

1100
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:16,840
I feel like Fuse is a good solo character.

1101
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:19,400
If we can't get Fuse.

1102
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:25,230
Their fucking reinforce is always pretty good.

1103
01:26:25,410 --> 01:26:26,070
What the fuck?

1104
01:26:26,610 --> 01:26:28,110
Okay, um, that...

1105
01:26:28,110 --> 01:26:29,670
Ooh, that tracking, though.

1106
01:26:30,910 --> 01:26:31,730
That tracking.

1107
01:26:35,770 --> 01:26:37,690
That tracking was a little...

1108
01:26:37,690 --> 01:26:38,770
Ooh, to be desired.

1109
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:43,970
Alright.

1110
01:26:46,290 --> 01:26:47,090
New and old.

1111
01:26:47,650 --> 01:26:49,930
God damn, everybody wants to play Fuse.

1112
01:26:50,490 --> 01:26:51,210
I guess Octane?

1113
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:53,450
But he's too fast.

1114
01:26:54,330 --> 01:26:56,210
He's too fucking fast.

1115
01:26:56,790 --> 01:26:57,830
Alright, we'll try Catalyst.

1116
01:26:59,110 --> 01:27:00,310
We'll try Catalyst here.

1117
01:27:01,150 --> 01:27:04,110
I would love to play Octane, but he's so fucking fast.

1118
01:27:04,170 --> 01:27:05,070
I feel like I'm just...

1119
01:27:05,070 --> 01:27:05,550
I'm going to get...

1120
01:27:05,570 --> 01:27:16,550

1127
01:28:20,330 --> 01:28:22,530
I heard it's strong, but I don't know if it actually is.

1128
01:28:24,730 --> 01:28:26,090
Oh my god, people are calming.

1129
01:28:32,190 --> 01:28:34,330
Oh, I want to take the hat, the...

1130

I want to take the carbine, but there's no fucking...

1131
01:28:38,450 --> 01:28:40,970
Wow, looks like the next ring drew thin.

1132
01:28:41,170 --> 01:28:42,510
There's no, like, light ammo.

1133
01:28:42,510 --> 01:28:43,750
I would have taken the carbine.

1134
01:28:46,870 --> 01:28:47,350

Like, I don't know.

1183
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:38,860
Remember the last time I asked people if they were real and
apparently they were real players?

1184
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:40,580
And then I feel bad.

1185
01:33:41,420 --> 01:33:42,300

1195
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:20,500
He's getting shot by...

1196
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:21,200

Okay.

1202
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:42,340
My shields need a bit more power.

01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:44,740
Please keep a shield, please.

1204
01:36:08,790 --> 01:36:10,090

01:37:49,370 --> 01:37:51,430
I've never seen that before in my life.

1217
01:37:52,970 --> 01:37:54,370
What the fuck is that?

1218
01:37:59,130 --> 01:38:00,950
I'm doing tricks and everything.

1219
01:38:01,070 --> 01:38:02,290
It's like my little skate deck.

1220
01:38:04,150 --> 01:38:06,750
It does feel like really thick, though.

1221
01:38:07,750 --> 01:38:09,150
I don't know if I'm like fat or that.

1222
01:38:17,850 --> 01:38:18,370

01:38:20,870 --> 01:38:21,790

1226
01:38:29,090 --> 01:38:30,550
It'll be really... Oh, I see it.

1227
01:38:31,910 --> 01:38:34,050
I don't have any nades, though.

1228
01:38:37,090 --> 01:38:37,690
What the fuck?

1229
01:38:37,710 --> 01:38:38,490
I don't like that.

1230
01:38:38,810 --> 01:38:39,810
The reload.

1231
01:38:40,550 --> 01:38:41,970
The reload is too much.

1232
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:45,510
That's crazy.

1233
01:38:45,650 --> 01:38:47,250
I did that much damage with my R9.

1234
01:38:49,150 --> 01:38:51,670
Reloaded throws me off What?

1235
01:38:53,470 --> 01:38:54,350

01:38:58,260 --> 01:38:59,240
Oh, yeah, thank you for the raid!

1237
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:00,520
I'm sorry, I didn't see who raided me.

1238
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:01,940
But thank you so much.

1239
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:04,120
Could like...

1240
01:39:04,120 --> 01:39:05,900

1242
01:39:09,020 --> 01:39:12,260

Whoa, oh my god!

1244
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:16,060
There we go.

1245
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:19,240
That's fine.

1246
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:20,380
Where are we?

1247
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:21,040
Rotating.

1248
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:21,720

1249
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:38,840

guys in the back line just to die like that never trust your

1251
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:56,960
teammates play for yourself always I wish I could just die.

1252
01:39:58,360 --> 01:39:59,760
Always play for yourself!

1253
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:06,060
Oh my god.

1254
01:40:06,100 --> 01:40:10,780
I literally covered my team by killing the team, by killing
the people that were flanking us.

1255
01:40:14,030 --> 01:40:15,470
No, it's no use.

1256
01:40:15,750 --> 01:40:17,110
If I crawl, I don't want them to get my loot.

1257
01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:19,130
I'm trying to make sure they don't take my shit.

1258
01:40:21,530 --> 01:40:25,190
I want to, yeah, they should give a give up so they can
craft me and press me.

1259
01:40:26,230 --> 01:40:33,610
never play for the team because I wanted to take the
redeploy and then my team was getting shot in the back so I

1260
01:40:33,610 --> 01:40:48,670
covered them and then they left me to die they left the ace
they didn't even try and craft me oh my god can't even get

1261
01:40:48,670 --> 01:40:52,910
rest they better oh my god bro I died for that

1262
01:40:56,530 --> 01:40:58,950
I truly died for that.

1263
01:40:59,370 --> 01:41:00,990
Oh shit, I crafted the wrong thing.

1264
01:41:01,830 --> 01:41:04,070
You crafted the wrong thing!

1265
01:41:10,050 --> 01:41:12,310
Oh my god, I died for this.

1266
01:41:13,010 --> 01:41:14,310
Recharging my shields.

1267
01:41:17,090 --> 01:41:19,210
I died for this.

1268
01:41:20,050 --> 01:41:21,690
Oh my god!

1269
01:41:22,410 --> 01:41:24,410
I died for this team!

1270
01:41:25,290 --> 01:41:27,170
If I was there, we could have won.

1271
01:41:27,370 --> 01:41:29,210
We could have won if I was.

1272
01:41:29,230 --> 01:41:29,850
was there.

1273
01:41:34,290 --> 01:41:35,930
I died for their sins.

1274
01:41:37,990 --> 01:41:38,990
Was not worth it.

1275
01:41:39,730 --> 01:41:41,370
It truly was not worth it.

1276
01:41:41,630 --> 01:41:42,810
You could have won.

1277
01:41:44,450 --> 01:41:46,250
I died for these whiffs.

1278
01:41:49,850 --> 01:41:51,170
Never again.

1279
01:41:52,070 --> 01:41:53,650
Never fucking again.

1280
01:41:55,190 --> 01:41:58,210
And you have the audacity to put on the print badge.

1281
01:42:00,190 --> 01:42:01,230
The free...

1282
01:42:01,230 --> 01:42:03,470
By the way, all the badges are unlocked.

1283
01:42:03,910 --> 01:42:04,870
So, like...

1284
01:42:05,810 --> 01:42:07,570
All the badges are unlocked.

1285
01:42:07,670 --> 01:42:09,690
So, like, you can put anything you want, technically.

1286
01:42:10,470 --> 01:42:11,730
So, like, I could technically...

1287
01:42:13,490 --> 01:42:14,510
Alright, let's see.

1288
01:42:15,950 --> 01:42:18,590
I could technically put, like, all bronze badges.

1289
01:42:19,070 --> 01:42:19,790
Just for fun.

1290
01:42:20,170 --> 01:42:21,670
I can do that right now.

1291
01:42:22,350 --> 01:42:23,190
And what's this?

1292
01:42:23,350 --> 01:42:23,570
Oh.

1293
01:42:24,530 --> 01:42:25,650
What the fuck?

1294
01:42:25,830 --> 01:42:26,590

Oh, it's World Edge.

1302
01:43:11,940 --> 01:43:14,140
It literally swapped the World's Edge.

1303

I want my badges.

1308
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,800
I gotta go back to the first screen.

1309
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:42,460
How do I go back?

1310
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:43,020
Like here?

1311
01:43:44,420 --> 01:43:45,740
Does this fix it?

1312
01:43:45,980 --> 01:43:46,280

1321
01:44:42,670 --> 01:44:44,870

I was like really, when I was like sick.

01:57:52,990 --> 01:57:54,270
I don't...

1480
01:57:54,270 --> 01:58:01,350
The crazy part is that my team was in this building and then
they let this Bangalore just stay down there.

1481
01:58:02,850 --> 01:58:03,310
Oh, my God.

1482
01:58:03,450 --> 01:58:03,970
Wait, do I...

1483
01:58:03,970 --> 01:58:04,570
Should I reboot?

1484
01:58:05,350 --> 01:58:06,530
I'm going to reboot the game.

1485
01:58:07,250 --> 01:58:08,010
I don't like that.

1486
01:58:08,050 --> 01:58:09,410
I want to change my badges.

1487
01:58:10,350 --> 01:58:11,830
I'm going to reboot my game, guys.

1488
01:58:12,750 --> 01:58:15,750
Now for another five minutes.

1489
01:58:17,470 --> 01:58:27,890
I assumed that my team cleared the bottom floor Because they
were all chilling in the second floor Like They were all

1490
01:58:27,890 --> 01:58:33,950
hanging out on the second floor But silly me assuming my
team covered the first floor

1491
01:58:38,790 --> 01:58:49,870
You assumed it wrong I did not expect a person down there
Your first mistake was assuming.

1492
01:58:50,650 --> 01:58:53,870
The thing is, his entire team was dead, so he dragged me
down with him.

1493
01:58:54,110 --> 01:58:56,770
It's like, if I'm gonna die, I'm gonna make sure I dragged
us.

1494
01:58:57,030 --> 01:58:57,490
No!

1495
01:58:58,210 --> 01:59:00,010
I can't, I still can't.

1496
01:59:00,350 --> 01:59:00,910
No!

1497
01:59:01,710 --> 01:59:03,890
They took my money now.

1498
01:59:05,090 --> 01:59:06,990
I don't even know you see this.

1499
01:59:07,270 --> 01:59:09,270
It's minus 9999.

1500
01:59:10,430 --> 01:59:11,430
Oh my god.

1501
01:59:11,790 --> 01:59:14,170
Now they've taken my money, too.

1502
01:59:14,510 --> 01:59:16,750
Now I've been dead in Apex.

1503
01:59:16,770 --> 01:59:37,290

1507
01:59:53,970 --> 01:59:55,030
He is, right?

1508
01:59:55,770 --> 01:59:58,030
Is he playing bot lobby or with actual people?

1509
01:59:58,190 --> 01:59:58,910
I can't tell.

1510
01:59:59,450 --> 02:00:00,330
I'll leave the party.

1511
02:00:04,990 --> 02:00:05,630
Oh, yeah.

1512
02:00:05,690 --> 02:00:10,430
As I was saying, thank you, everybody, for pre-ordering the
anniversary merch, guys.

1513
02:00:10,850 --> 02:00:18,470
You guys exceeded my distributor and manager's expectations
because they got really, really worried about especially the

1514
02:00:18,470 --> 02:00:21,510
plushies too because we have to order a lot to it so that I
can make it $25.

1515
02:00:22,950 --> 02:00:24,390
So thank you everybody for ordering.

1516
02:00:24,610 --> 02:00:26,190

1517
02:00:26,510 --> 02:00:27,170
Thank you, guys.

We won't have...

1520
02:00:31,590 --> 02:00:32,150
What's the word?

1521
02:00:32,230 --> 02:00:33,750
Like the overstock, like the dog shirts.

1522
02:00:35,190 --> 02:00:37,510
We won't be drowning in dog shirts.

1523
02:00:38,070 --> 02:00:43,170
Okay, we are still drowning in dog shirts, but like it won't
be like the dog shirts, guys.

1524
02:00:43,350 --> 02:00:45,190
We're actually selling them.

1525
02:00:48,130 --> 02:00:59,130

Where did this go?

1530
02:01:29,570 --> 02:01:32,030

1539
02:02:26,750 --> 02:02:28,550
The wrong old man.

1540
02:02:28,750 --> 02:02:29,670
One tab.

1541
02:02:29,870 --> 02:02:31,790
And then he fucking got...

1542
02:02:31,790 --> 02:02:32,810
He got fired.

1543
02:02:33,370 --> 02:02:33,670
I don't know.

1544
02:02:33,710 --> 02:02:35,370
He retired or some shit.

1545
02:02:37,910 --> 02:02:39,270
He quit his job.

1546
02:02:41,190 --> 02:02:42,750
God, he has to grow thicker skin.

1547
02:02:42,830 --> 02:02:43,850
If that's all it takes.

1548
02:02:47,510 --> 02:02:48,130
Oh my god, nice.

1549
02:02:48,690 --> 02:02:49,330
First blood.

1550
02:02:49,790 --> 02:02:51,690
And not the good blood moon kind.

1551
02:02:52,950 --> 02:02:53,330
Yeah.

1552
02:02:55,130 --> 02:03:00,650
Oh my god, I swear to God, there's no, do not make me
fucking queue another luck.

1553
02:03:16,340 --> 02:03:18,500
Oh, that's close.

1568
02:04:18,970 --> 02:04:21,960

02:04:45,150 --> 02:04:46,950
Yeah, I need you to chill right now.

1577
02:04:47,410 --> 02:04:48,090
Now I can cover.

1578
02:05:00,110 --> 02:05:03,230
I don't have enough ammo

1579
02:05:07,310 --> 02:05:18,230

02:05:47,510 --> 02:05:48,930
Oh, fucking course.

1584
02:05:49,730 --> 02:05:50,870
You can raise that thing.

1585
02:05:51,430 --> 02:05:52,770
I don't think he can.

1586
02:05:53,810 --> 02:05:54,390
I'll let you know.

1587
02:05:54,570 --> 02:05:55,410

You're crazy.

1591
02:05:59,530 --> 02:06:00,690
I'm fucking dead.

1592
02:06:02,090 --> 02:06:03,310
That was a brave race.

1593
02:06:04,930 --> 02:06:06,290
Oh, my God.

1594
02:06:07,530 --> 02:06:08,770
I fucking knew it.

1595
02:06:08,810 --> 02:06:09,550
I was like.

1596
02:06:09,690 --> 02:06:11,630
Is that a goddamn routine?

1597
02:06:12,150 --> 02:06:12,690
Is that...

1598
02:06:16,450 --> 02:06:18,350
Just like old times.

1599
02:06:19,070 --> 02:06:19,790
Just like...

1600
02:06:19,790 --> 02:06:21,370
I thought it was like one guy.

1601
02:06:21,470 --> 02:06:22,810
I heard one pair of footsteps.

1602
02:06:22,950 --> 02:06:23,610
So I was like, that's fine.

1603
02:06:23,710 --> 02:06:24,230
I can take him.

1604
02:06:24,330 --> 02:06:25,730
And then I got fucking firing squad.

1605
02:06:26,270 --> 02:06:26,750
I...

1606
02:06:30,370 --> 02:06:32,170
I got fucking...

1607
02:06:32,170 --> 02:06:34,630
Like, got gang banged there by two people.

1608
02:06:36,290 --> 02:06:37,090
I was like...

1609
02:06:37,090 --> 02:06:38,290
God damn it.

1610
02:06:41,310 --> 02:06:42,330
No, is it?

1611
02:06:42,370 --> 02:06:45,530
I thought- I think Wigg is playing an actual bot lobby right
now.

1612
02:06:46,030 --> 02:06:48,790
Why is he playing a fucking full bot lobby?

1613
02:06:50,370 --> 02:06:51,310
I'll message him.

1614
02:06:51,530 --> 02:06:54,090
Wait, when this- okay, it ends in like an hour and a half.

1615
02:06:54,930 --> 02:06:56,050
Yeah, he's literally it.

1616
02:06:56,350 --> 02:07:00,470
Why is he playing a full bot lobby?

1617
02:07:02,570 --> 02:07:07,170
Yo, you wanna- You wanna play together for the Axis?

1618
02:07:08,990 --> 02:07:09,470
Alas.

1619
02:07:17,730 --> 02:07:18,310
All right.

1620
02:07:18,850 --> 02:07:24,010
I think, you know, it is a nice, it's like a breath of fresh
air, because I haven't played in a long time.

1621
02:07:24,390 --> 02:07:30,490
So, like, for me, all of this is like, all this is new to
me, you know, like all the new mechanics, all the new perks

1622
02:07:30,490 --> 02:07:31,210
and everything.

1623
02:07:33,530 --> 02:07:35,310
And it's like, it's fun.

1624
02:07:35,390 --> 02:07:41,910
It's fun re-experiencing with breath of fresh air after,
like, not playing for a while, like, after taking a little

1625
02:07:41,910 --> 02:07:42,310
break.

1626
02:07:42,690 --> 02:07:42,970
You know?

1627
02:07:43,950 --> 02:07:44,630
It's nice.

1628
02:07:46,690 --> 02:07:55,290
I still can't believe they vote they keep they he just quit
I can't believe it he just actually just quit so I just got

1629
02:07:55,290 --> 02:08:10,410
in the game and I almost embarrassed myself almost like my
flight to him but then I shot myself wait with who I

1630
02:08:10,410 --> 02:08:17,890
couldn't tell who it was my choosing thoughts would have won
and I would have done it I'm like, we're like retired.

1631
02:08:18,090 --> 02:08:21,090
He was like, I've done my time.

1632
02:08:21,270 --> 02:08:21,790
She got a skin.

1633
02:08:21,870 --> 02:08:22,410
Watson, I think.

1634
02:08:22,550 --> 02:08:23,610
Lobbies are bugging people.

1635
02:08:23,970 --> 02:08:25,470
The thing is, I don't know how rank is going to go.

1636
02:08:26,090 --> 02:08:26,550
What the hell?

1637
02:08:26,630 --> 02:08:27,070
Doki bird?

1638
02:08:27,230 --> 02:08:27,570
She got a W.

1639
02:08:27,750 --> 02:08:27,930
Wait.

1640
02:08:28,350 --> 02:08:28,650
Oh.

1641
02:08:34,050 --> 02:08:35,970

02:08:36,130 --> 02:08:36,510
Whoa.

1643
02:08:36,810 --> 02:08:37,910
And they're like, wait.

1644
02:08:39,450 --> 02:08:41,130
That's the, that's her.

1645
02:08:41,130 --> 02:08:49,410
Water solid now

1646
02:08:55,330 --> 02:09:06,610
That's a girl with the Watson skin I like how they just

1648
02:09:15,050 --> 02:09:16,630
I actually don't know where loot is on this map.

1649
02:09:17,870 --> 02:09:18,930
I didn't get anything.

1650
02:09:20,090 --> 02:09:21,130
Are you fucking kidding me?

1651
02:09:21,290 --> 02:09:21,930
I actually have no loot.

1652
02:09:25,110 --> 02:09:26,650
I have no gun.

1653
02:09:31,190 --> 02:09:31,950
Okay, whatever.

1654
02:09:38,230 --> 02:09:39,270
Well, I have a bow check now.

1655
02:09:44,380 --> 02:09:45,580

Oh my god, please!

1657
02:09:51,680 --> 02:09:53,520
Is there any gun?

1658
02:09:54,900 --> 02:09:56,240
Other than the Bocheck!

1659
02:09:57,640 --> 02:09:59,520
That lifelike just ran in front of me.

1660
02:09:59,820 --> 02:09:59,820

Yeah, they're here.

1670
02:10:32,490 --> 02:10:33,450
That's fine.

1671
02:10:36,310 --> 02:10:36,990
I'm sure you're seeing this guy.

1672
02:10:37,850 --> 02:10:38,210
I don't care.

1673
02:10:42,070 --> 02:10:42,730
I'm covering.

1674
02:10:45,690 --> 02:10:46,390
Alright, nice.

1675
02:10:48,050 --> 02:10:52,110
I don't know why he, like, ran through that thinking Like, I
don't know.

1676
02:10:52,830 --> 02:10:54,090
He's like, nah, it's fine.

1677
02:10:55,230 --> 02:10:56,690
He's not gonna see me.

1678

And I'm like, God, I'm like, bro, I can still, like, see you

I'm gonna get this out of here, though, before I do
anything.

1682
02:11:10,450 --> 02:11:10,910
Oh, my God.

1683
02:11:10,950 --> 02:11:12,530
There's a window that's just there?

I'm sorry!

1703
02:12:25,740 --> 02:12:28,340
The catalyst and the altar look the same to me!

1704
02:12:31,120 --> 02:12:32,780
The characters, they all blurred.

1705
02:12:32,800 --> 02:12:48,980
together it's been so long guys you have to admit it's been
so long that all the characters tend to blur in

Okay.

1711
02:14:02,630 --> 02:14:03,110
That's unlucky.

1712
02:14:04,130 --> 02:14:07,090
Oh, I can't, I should not have been wasting my ammo for
that.

1713
02:14:07,090 --> 02:14:08,230
This is so unfortunate.

1714
02:14:09,550 --> 02:14:13,550
Um, I do not have ammo for this, but...

1715
02:14:13,550 --> 02:14:14,470

02:14:19,650 --> 02:14:20,310
Are you fucking...

1720
02:14:20,310 --> 02:14:21,030
There's another squad.

1721
02:14:21,390 --> 02:14:24,190
Must go.

1722
02:14:25,570 --> 02:14:26,550
There we go.

1723
02:14:27,330 --> 02:14:29,490
There's actually so many squad.

I see.

1726
02:14:46,300 --> 02:14:48,340
It's bad they're just gonna chase me.

1727
02:14:56,360 --> 02:15:00,300
They're just gonna chase me.

1728
02:15:01,380 --> 02:15:01,720
How?

1729
02:15:04,420 --> 02:15:04,620
What?

1730
02:15:08,430 --> 02:15:10,530
Oh my god, at least I grabbed some light ammo.

1731
02:15:14,360 --> 02:15:15,480
My fucking...

1732
02:15:15,480 --> 02:15:16,700
Oh no.

1733
02:15:16,940 --> 02:15:18,620
This bitch is in here.

1734
02:15:20,340 --> 02:15:24,560
I can just craft it.

1735
02:15:26,400 --> 02:15:27,120
I have enough meals.

1736
02:15:28,780 --> 02:15:29,520
Wait, is that crafter?

1737
02:15:30,100 --> 02:15:30,940
That is, alright.

1738
02:15:34,830 --> 02:15:36,050
I don't have enough meds.

1739
02:15:37,170 --> 02:15:38,490
I'll just craft them.

1740
02:15:40,810 --> 02:15:41,450
I should be allowed.

1741
02:15:41,550 --> 02:15:43,170
I should be able to craft in zone, right?

1742
02:15:43,430 --> 02:15:44,690
You didn't change that, right?

1743
02:15:48,890 --> 02:15:49,770
Alright, there we go.

1744
02:15:59,130 --> 02:15:59,570

02:16:03,310 --> 02:16:03,970
It's fine.

1746
02:16:04,090 --> 02:16:04,650
I made it.

1747
02:16:07,670 --> 02:16:08,190
Wee!

1748
02:16:09,630 --> 02:16:10,950

That's awkward.

1753
02:16:21,570 --> 02:16:22,830
I didn't realize she was...

1754
02:16:22,830 --> 02:16:23,350
It's fine.

1755
02:16:23,490 --> 02:16:24,430
I couldn't save her.

1756
02:16:25,430 --> 02:16:26,910
Wait, I didn't even thirst her?

1757
02:16:27,170 --> 02:16:27,590
Nice.

1758
02:16:28,770 --> 02:16:29,250
There we go.

I'm a hero Yeah, no octane movement is crazy in this game,
but like he's so fast.

It's fine.

1767
02:17:13,690 --> 02:17:15,090
This is all close range time.

1768
02:17:16,150 --> 02:17:16,450
Wait, what?

1769
02:17:16,690 --> 02:17:17,250

Alright, let's see if he's still here.

1772
02:17:24,830 --> 02:17:26,690
I'm gonna get shit on in a 1v1.

1773
02:17:27,130 --> 02:17:27,970
We'll find out.

1774
02:17:28,670 --> 02:17:30,510
I like pushing limits as much as the next guy.

1775
02:17:30,770 --> 02:17:31,390
But we gotta go.

1776
02:17:37,910 --> 02:17:38,430
No?

1777
02:17:39,930 --> 02:17:41,050
I heard a play.

1778
02:17:45,430 --> 02:17:47,790
Oh my god, my first attachment.

1779
02:17:49,610 --> 02:17:52,290
My actual first attachment in this game.

1780
02:17:54,970 --> 02:17:55,390
Oh, here?

1781
02:17:55,670 --> 02:17:56,450
Alright, let's go.

1783
02:18:04,540 --> 02:18:05,220
That contained.

1784
02:18:05,300 --> 02:18:05,980
Someone got it.

1785
02:18:06,220 --> 02:18:08,160
And then there's the dormant thing too.

1786
02:18:09,720 --> 02:18:10,980
Where does your...

1787
02:18:10,980 --> 02:18:13,980

1788
02:18:14,260 --> 02:18:14,860
Oh, hey.

1789
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:18,480
Animals don't really have anything.

1790
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:23,120
I'm betting a lot on close range right now, honestly.

1791
02:18:24,420 --> 02:18:26,900
I've been my entire life on this close range shit.

1792
02:18:30,690 --> 02:18:32,570
At least I didn't die to the ring.

1793
02:18:33,190 --> 02:18:33,470
You know?

1794
02:18:35,050 --> 02:18:35,450
Ooh.

1795
02:18:35,830 --> 02:18:37,830
It's on the other side, though.

1796
02:18:38,550 --> 02:18:39,270
Of these walls.

1797
02:18:45,370 --> 02:18:46,610
No, that's our altar.

1798
02:18:47,110 --> 02:18:48,830
Our altar has a passive where he can...

1799
02:18:49,470 --> 02:18:49,910
Here.

1800
02:18:53,190 --> 02:18:54,550
They're like here.

1801
02:18:56,410 --> 02:18:58,310
I don't want to use my Q in.

1802
02:18:58,550 --> 02:18:59,790
Because, like, I don't know where they are.

1803
02:19:00,110 --> 02:19:02,130
I'm too scared to, like, just run in.

1804
02:19:06,470 --> 02:19:06,530
Oh.

1805
02:19:07,570 --> 02:19:09,390

1806
02:19:10,590 --> 02:19:12,110

1807
02:19:14,230 --> 02:19:14,670

Oh my god, this is bad.

1820

I had the backup.

1821
02:21:02,870 --> 02:21:04,350
He has to come over.

1822
02:21:14,800 --> 02:21:15,240
Alright.

1823
02:21:16,280 --> 02:21:16,920

I'm way too fast.

1843
02:23:14,310 --> 02:23:20,010

Maybe it'll be better.

1848
02:23:25,750 --> 02:23:27,230
Two cars, infinite ammo.

1849
02:23:27,370 --> 02:23:27,930

Wait, I'm in the open.

1855
02:24:11,690 --> 02:24:13,210
I'm in the open.

1856
02:24:13,390 --> 02:24:13,650
I don't know.

1857
02:24:13,730 --> 02:24:15,870
Oh my god, he's fighting in the OP.

1858
02:24:16,190 --> 02:24:17,450
He's fucking crazy.

1859
02:24:17,830 --> 02:24:18,110
Oh!

1860
02:24:21,750 --> 02:24:23,830
He's gotta stop doing that, I will say.

1861
02:24:24,030 --> 02:24:25,650
He should really stop doing that.

1862
02:24:26,330 --> 02:24:27,610
Not very smart.

1863
02:24:30,390 --> 02:24:32,170
You ran in the open!

1864
02:24:32,310 --> 02:24:33,530
What do you mean?

1865
02:24:36,170 --> 02:24:39,770
Oh my god, you ran in the open.

1866
02:24:39,970 --> 02:24:40,990
What do you mean?

1867
02:24:41,130 --> 02:24:43,150
My mouse is tweaked out.

1868
02:24:51,730 --> 02:24:52,410
Bro.

1869
02:24:56,180 --> 02:24:57,820
I couldn't do anything there.

1870
02:24:59,100 --> 02:25:00,160
This guy.

1871
02:25:00,600 --> 02:25:02,640
But my mouse is tweaked up, bro.

1872
02:25:03,360 --> 02:25:05,800
Like, he runs straight in the open air.

1873
02:25:06,700 --> 02:25:07,900
No, they got both my cars.

1874
02:25:07,920 --> 02:25:10,420
Oh, no, they got both of them.

1875
02:25:11,020 --> 02:25:12,000
Don't you don't understand?

1876
02:25:12,140 --> 02:25:13,160
It was his mouse.

1877
02:25:13,500 --> 02:25:17,500
Oh, I gave them two cars.

1878
02:25:28,150 --> 02:25:28,630
Right.

1879
02:25:32,090 --> 02:25:33,250
He doesn't get...

1880
02:25:33,250 --> 02:25:34,850
And he gets rest.

1881
02:25:35,210 --> 02:25:35,950
And I died.

1882
02:25:36,290 --> 02:25:37,150
Never again.

1883
02:25:39,590 --> 02:25:40,270
Never.

1884
02:25:40,630 --> 02:25:42,090
Never help him.

1885
02:25:48,720 --> 02:25:51,140
Bro, died like 10 times.

1886
02:25:51,420 --> 02:25:53,500
Like, bro, there's something wrong with my mouse, guys.

1887
02:25:57,180 --> 02:25:58,400
Never be a hero.

1888
02:25:59,180 --> 02:26:00,340
Never be a hero.

1889
02:26:01,900 --> 02:26:04,660
Yeah, his wrist timer was so low.

1890
02:26:07,140 --> 02:26:10,020
Okay, guys, I will say I'm not a fan of Octane.

1891
02:26:10,260 --> 02:26:12,360
Because, like, I'm not used to...

1892
02:26:12,380 --> 02:26:13,700
I'm not used to the speed.

1893
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:15,340
I really am not.

1894
02:26:17,180 --> 02:26:20,980
I was just like, I was like, oh no.

1895
02:26:21,640 --> 02:26:23,600
How do I aim?

1896
02:26:28,300 --> 02:26:31,000
Oh no, what do I do?

1897
02:26:41,880 --> 02:26:43,560
I enjoyed the movement.

1898
02:26:43,660 --> 02:26:46,400
I will say the movement felt amazing.

1899
02:26:47,540 --> 02:26:49,780
It did feel amazing.

1900
02:26:49,800 --> 02:27:02,540
Amazing the play when I'm running around but then the moment
I bring out the gun it was I was not it I think like if I

1901
02:27:02,540 --> 02:27:09,780
was on controller I think I think like it would be it would
be like better if I was on controller with the move with the

1902
02:27:09,780 --> 02:27:19,100
speed because then I didn't have to focus on the aim the aim
assist will do it all for me but uh but then I had to

1903
02:27:19,100 --> 02:27:21,000
control my own aim for that

1904
02:27:31,870 --> 02:27:37,630
i love i love the bee hopping no bee hopping was very fun
with octane

1905
02:27:42,420 --> 02:27:45,680
it was very fun i felt like i could like dodge a lot of

1906
02:28:04,230 --> 02:28:10,870

1907

1909
02:28:36,990 --> 02:28:40,050

1910
02:28:40,050 --> 02:28:53,410

Wait, am I the first EN VTuber to get something for the

That's another team!

1959
02:32:32,290 --> 02:32:34,010
That's another team!

1960
02:32:34,250 --> 02:32:36,230
There's no way they rest them in one second!

1961
02:32:36,870 --> 02:32:38,070
There's no way!

1962
02:32:38,830 --> 02:32:41,230
They rest them in one second!

1963
02:32:42,950 --> 02:32:43,590
Like...

1964
02:32:43,590 --> 02:32:45,270
I was like, oh, there's just two guys.

1965
02:32:45,430 --> 02:32:46,150
And then I fucking...

1966
02:32:46,850 --> 02:32:50,770
I fucking rolled like a fucking limousine rolled up.

1967
02:32:51,710 --> 02:32:53,150
And he went, bop, bop!

1968
02:32:54,070 --> 02:32:56,050
They did a fucking drive by.

1969
02:32:57,730 --> 02:32:59,910
Scan said five people.

1970
02:33:00,270 --> 02:33:01,830
You know, it could have been three clones.

1971
02:33:02,090 --> 02:33:02,290
You know.

1972
02:33:06,070 --> 02:33:07,790
Your viewers just watched you die.

1973
02:33:08,090 --> 02:33:08,710
Like he said.

1974
02:33:08,950 --> 02:33:11,170
Yeah, but I didn't have a TTV name.

1975
02:33:11,450 --> 02:33:12,330
That's different, chat.

1976
02:33:12,790 --> 02:33:14,470
There was no TTV name.

1977
02:33:16,930 --> 02:33:18,890
It could have been three clones.

1978
02:33:19,450 --> 02:33:20,450
You don't know that.

1979
02:33:22,170 --> 02:33:23,710
The scan could have lied to me.

1980
02:33:24,070 --> 02:33:25,390
saw three clones.

1981
02:33:26,510 --> 02:33:27,610
I wasn't sure.

1982
02:33:31,310 --> 02:33:33,830
I thought I saw three clones.

1983
02:33:35,230 --> 02:33:37,290
It could have happened to anybody.

1984
02:33:39,390 --> 02:33:40,470
That's true.

1985
02:33:42,830 --> 02:33:44,050
Alright, we'll try Bloodhound again.

1986
02:33:45,070 --> 02:33:45,890
I wish I...

1987
02:33:45,890 --> 02:33:49,010
Oh man, sometimes if I was a controller player, our team
would be the dream.

1988
02:33:50,590 --> 02:33:51,150
Honestly.

1989
02:33:53,050 --> 02:33:54,050
He would have been...

1990
02:33:54,070 --> 02:33:58,600
in the dream just let my aim assist take the wheel and i
just run at them

1991
02:34:08,060 --> 02:34:18,560
i'm just not used to how fast his move it's just so fast i
get lost in the sauce i truly do i whip up my gun and then

1992
02:34:18,560 --> 02:34:21,360
it's like we're in my aiming eyes

1993
02:34:26,840 --> 02:34:29,340
no i don't like responsibility

1994
02:34:33,160 --> 02:34:33,960
Get ready.

1995
02:34:34,440 --> 02:34:35,120
Moving out.

1996
02:34:35,640 --> 02:34:36,280
Oh, shit.

1997
02:34:36,420 --> 02:34:40,040
I like how people, like, wear all the, like, cosmetics and
stuff.

1998
02:34:40,580 --> 02:34:44,940
At the moment, they, uh, they put all the cosmetics on.

1999
02:34:45,640 --> 02:34:47,260
I'm gonna grab this Eva 8 over here.

2000
02:34:48,360 --> 02:34:51,700
I feel like if this was Ring, then watch it would be really
good, but it's not Ring.

2001
02:34:56,410 --> 02:34:56,970
Somebody's here.

2002
02:34:58,710 --> 02:34:59,150
Alright.

2003
02:34:59,410 --> 02:34:59,990
On our side.

2004
02:35:01,010 --> 02:35:01,890
On our side?

2005
02:35:06,160 --> 02:35:07,120
Yeah, he is.

2006
02:35:13,600 --> 02:35:14,920
Where's his teammate, though?

2007
02:35:16,060 --> 02:35:17,200
I'll grab the Mastiff, actually.

2008
02:35:17,380 --> 02:35:18,060
Oh, never mind.

2009
02:35:19,100 --> 02:35:20,780
I guess I won't grab the Mastiff.

2010
02:35:22,120 --> 02:35:23,260
Very nice, very nice, very nice.

2011
02:35:23,980 --> 02:35:24,360
Look at that.

2012
02:35:24,380 --> 02:35:25,400
I contribute it.

2013
02:35:25,760 --> 02:35:29,240
I shot the down guy so I can buff up my damage stats.

2014
02:35:31,640 --> 02:35:33,800
There are people fighting here.

2015
02:35:36,520 --> 02:35:39,060
I want to fight that team, honestly.

2016
02:35:41,080 --> 02:35:42,380
I'm scanning it.

2017
02:35:44,520 --> 02:35:45,100
Wait, what?

2018
02:35:45,500 --> 02:35:45,680
Oh.

2019
02:35:46,740 --> 02:35:48,060
I'm going to scan this.

2020
02:35:51,120 --> 02:35:51,280
Oh.

2021
02:35:52,020 --> 02:35:55,400
I swear to God, I heard, like, gunshot sounds in there.

2022
02:35:58,320 --> 02:35:59,560
Unless, I think my range didn't.

2023
02:36:00,920 --> 02:36:01,660
Oh, nice.

2024
02:36:03,980 --> 02:36:04,360
What?

2025
02:36:06,720 --> 02:36:07,520
Oh, shit.

2026
02:36:07,660 --> 02:36:08,420
There is people here.

2027
02:36:09,540 --> 02:36:12,320
There is people in this house too, but whatever.

2028
02:36:14,080 --> 02:36:16,060
It would be nice to...

2029
02:36:21,470 --> 02:36:21,830
Wait.

2030
02:36:23,310 --> 02:36:24,350
Oh my god!

2031
02:36:24,670 --> 02:36:25,290
Oh, it's Dre.

2032
02:36:28,470 --> 02:36:29,250
It's Dre.

2033
02:36:29,490 --> 02:36:29,730
Okay.

2034
02:36:30,430 --> 02:36:32,510
It's a guy that's been playing every day.

2035
02:36:36,110 --> 02:36:38,150
He's been playing every day.

2036
02:36:38,290 --> 02:36:38,930
Makes sense.

2037
02:36:39,210 --> 02:36:40,630
You're crazy for that.

2038
02:36:40,950 --> 02:36:42,850
You are fucking crazy for that.

2039
02:36:43,210 --> 02:36:44,630
Oh, he's over here.

2040
02:36:47,450 --> 02:36:48,210
You know...

2041
02:36:50,070 --> 02:36:53,910
It's a guy that's been playing Apex every day for seven
years.

2042
02:36:54,470 --> 02:36:55,490
You know...

2043
02:36:55,490 --> 02:36:56,430
You know...

2044
02:36:56,430 --> 02:36:57,690
It's understandable.

2045
02:36:58,050 --> 02:36:58,930
It's understandable.

2046
02:36:59,410 --> 02:37:00,730
He never stopped.

2047
02:37:01,250 --> 02:37:02,210
He never...

2048
02:37:05,830 --> 02:37:06,990
He never...

2049
02:37:06,990 --> 02:37:09,190
This man is three stacking!

2050
02:37:09,770 --> 02:37:12,550
You don't need a three stack, bro!

2051
02:37:14,850 --> 02:37:23,050
I'm just jealous he has friends I'm just jealous it's just
my jealousy talking it's just what fair

2052
02:37:27,550 --> 02:37:42,870
it's fine it's okay it's okay it's alright he's just he's
just re-stacking I'm just jealous that's right we all saw

2053
02:37:42,870 --> 02:37:43,630
that Trey!

2054
02:37:44,290 --> 02:37:46,790
This free stack won't stop you from gravity!

2055
02:37:49,350 --> 02:37:51,710
Imagine having friends.

2056
02:37:52,570 --> 02:37:55,230
Your free stack can't stop gravity.

2057
02:37:56,930 --> 02:37:58,850
No, Wigg said he can't play.

2058
02:37:59,590 --> 02:38:00,890
He's like, I had to go.

2059
02:38:14,380 --> 02:38:15,300
This time.

2060
02:38:18,240 --> 02:38:21,400
Having friends in Apex is basically cheating.

2061
02:38:21,420 --> 02:38:22,920
I have friends.

2062
02:38:23,040 --> 02:38:25,560
They just aren't in the early access.

2063
02:38:25,940 --> 02:38:32,140
Okay, I swear I have friends It's like I swear to God.

2064
02:38:32,400 --> 02:38:32,820
Oh girlfriend.

2065
02:38:33,040 --> 02:38:38,180
She just lives in Canada like I swear I have friends.

2066
02:38:38,400 --> 02:38:41,600
They're just internet is really bad in Alaska guys.

2067
02:38:41,800 --> 02:38:46,960
It's just really bad So just and they don't have they don't
have like the early access.

2068
02:38:47,240 --> 02:38:47,940
It's not like

2069
02:38:52,740 --> 02:38:56,240
I'm just the only one with early access, guys.

2070
02:38:56,500 --> 02:38:57,580
I'm the jump master.

2071
02:38:58,980 --> 02:39:00,400
They go to a different school.

2072
02:39:00,640 --> 02:39:01,820
You wouldn't know them.

2073
02:39:05,640 --> 02:39:06,600
You wouldn't know them.

2074
02:39:06,700 --> 02:39:07,860
They just go to a different school.

2075
02:39:18,280 --> 02:39:18,800
Hmm.

2076
02:39:19,680 --> 02:39:20,120
Doki.

2077
02:39:24,080 --> 02:39:25,200
Oh, fuck.

2078
02:39:26,060 --> 02:39:28,320
Slam my head against the wall.

2079
02:39:29,440 --> 02:39:30,960
Didn't wear my special helmet.

2080
02:39:33,660 --> 02:39:35,320
Alright, they're just in the other house.

2081
02:39:37,400 --> 02:39:41,480
Yay, I got the best loot in all except...

2082
02:39:42,020 --> 02:39:42,920

02:39:42,920 --> 02:39:43,600
Oh, okay, there you go.

I got a gun.

2085
02:39:45,180 --> 02:39:46,500
Yeah, they're homeschooled.

2086
02:39:46,540 --> 02:39:48,640
That's why you've never seen them before.

2087
02:39:53,100 --> 02:39:55,000
Where is he getting shot by?

2088
02:39:56,120 --> 02:39:57,880
I don't feel safe anymore.

2089
02:40:08,510 --> 02:40:15,030
okay i could have killed him the first two shots were no
regs i fucking sucked that guy should have been dead if i

2090
02:40:15,030 --> 02:40:21,750

want like being in the open here

2091
02:40:27,220 --> 02:40:31,620

2093
02:40:47,950 --> 02:40:49,370
They're gonna push me.

2094
02:40:59,390 --> 02:41:00,150
Unless...

2095
02:41:00,150 --> 02:41:01,990
Movement didn't save your ass!

2096
02:41:03,510 --> 02:41:04,270
That's right!

2097
02:41:04,570 --> 02:41:05,090
Worth it!

2098
02:41:05,310 --> 02:41:05,870
Worth it!

2099
02:41:06,190 --> 02:41:07,950
Fucking try to movement shit!

2100
02:41:10,850 --> 02:41:12,490
That's fucking right!

2101
02:41:12,950 --> 02:41:15,110
That's embarrassing for you!

2102
02:41:18,630 --> 02:41:25,390
I had By the way, by the way, I don't know if you guys saw
that.

2103
02:41:25,630 --> 02:41:27,490
She was full HP.

2104
02:41:28,310 --> 02:41:30,750
I had no shields.

2105
02:41:31,570 --> 02:41:33,770
And I had no shield.

2106
02:41:33,950 --> 02:41:37,070
And she tried to fucking do a...

2107
02:41:37,070 --> 02:41:41,330
She tried to do a fucking wall jump tap stream.

2108
02:41:41,650 --> 02:41:43,570
Like, oh, she's not gonna hit that.

2109
02:41:43,950 --> 02:41:47,210
Like, that's okay, great.

2110
02:41:47,410 --> 02:41:48,970
Oh, and I'll take you out back to the...

2111
02:41:48,970 --> 02:41:50,150
Your team's gonna go to the lobby.

2112
02:41:50,170 --> 02:42:07,330
too that's a key right that's right try moving from my
fucking fist get one clip and then get fisted that's right

2113
02:42:07,330 --> 02:42:22,810
take them out of the lobby that's right imagine trying to do
a movement tech just to get shit on like that got no clip

2114
02:42:22,810 --> 02:42:36,130
here i got my clip at least a lot of these are i hope it's
getting faster it says that starting server would be awkward

2115
02:42:36,130 --> 02:42:45,470
if you queue together guys i forgot like oh my gosh i
remember in the i didn't realize that early access people

2116
02:42:45,470 --> 02:42:52,290
because like in the older early access access when i used to
do when i did the other early access in the past um it was

2117
02:42:52,290 --> 02:42:59,030
like you can't stack because it was all like solo queue but
now everyone is taking advantage of the fact because like

2118
02:42:59,030 --> 02:43:13,220
obviously obviously you're gonna run down lobbies when
you're in a stack you know like obviously like it's just

2119
02:43:13,220 --> 02:43:19,600
it's just easier use three stacks for easier games i

2120
02:43:28,360 --> 02:43:34,980
don't know i don't want to play i'll play someone else
bloodhound yeah if i have if like if i like if i have

2121
02:43:34,980 --> 02:43:43,160
teammates that i can rely on i'll fucking run down everyone
yeah don't know the thrill you're right the thrill of

2122
02:43:43,160 --> 02:43:53,940
playing with two random people the risk of it all you know
are they are they real people or like are they actual real

2123
02:43:53,940 --> 02:44:03,340
people or are they where they they just came out of the womb
yeah it's a test of will.

2124
02:44:03,900 --> 02:44:06,000
I'm stronger than those stackers.

2125
02:44:08,960 --> 02:44:09,900
I'm stronger.

2126
02:44:11,300 --> 02:44:13,660
I was molded into solo queue.

2127
02:44:17,560 --> 02:44:19,640
Whether they're real or NPCs.

2128
02:44:27,360 --> 02:44:28,860
I'm just built different.

2129
02:44:28,920 --> 02:44:30,320
It's not cope, guys.

2130
02:44:30,460 --> 02:44:31,420
It's not cope.

2131
02:44:32,860 --> 02:44:36,140
You see, if I was stacking, it would be so boring.

2132
02:44:36,260 --> 02:44:38,700
Just running down every team.

2133
02:44:42,740 --> 02:44:56,180
guys it would have been so boring because then the games
would be just too easy guys there's no challenge there's no

2134
02:44:56,180 --> 02:45:02,960
actual challenge yeah and i like the challenge

2135
02:45:07,590 --> 02:45:10,570
that's right

2136
02:45:23,260 --> 02:45:34,100
all right come on yeah i was like come on i still can't
believe they took fuse out like like what happened like what

2137
02:45:34,100 --> 02:45:35,240
was going on

2138
02:45:38,600 --> 02:45:49,160
it's early access so only like invited content creators are
allowed to play on it yeah i'm not here to get carried i am

2141
02:46:05,750 --> 02:46:06,150
No, they did.

2142
02:46:06,250 --> 02:46:07,230
They took him out back.

2143
02:46:08,630 --> 02:46:11,150
He literally lasted like 30 minutes.

2144
02:46:13,470 --> 02:46:15,210
And then he's like, chips over.

2145
02:46:16,250 --> 02:46:18,890
They do this to fuse.

2146
02:46:22,330 --> 02:46:23,630

That was the R9.

2167
02:48:27,810 --> 02:48:28,910
That was the R9 box.

2168
02:48:29,150 --> 02:48:29,550
Okay, never mind.

2169
02:48:29,690 --> 02:48:30,670
I'm no longer sad.

2170
02:48:31,610 --> 02:48:32,410
Sadness gone.

2171
02:48:34,050 --> 02:48:37,630
Oh, there is another.

2172
02:48:41,850 --> 02:49:02,490
I think I'm gonna change it to the sadness cancelled no
longer sad okay oh I'm this way maybe I can flank from here

2173
02:49:02,490 --> 02:49:04,890

2174
02:49:10,390 --> 02:49:15,550

02:49:23,060 --> 02:49:30,320

2176
02:49:30,960 --> 02:49:31,660
It's not my gun.

2177
02:49:31,760 --> 02:49:32,300
The whiffs.

2178
02:49:32,800 --> 02:49:33,880
Oh my god.

2179
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:36,800
I am an R9 girl.

2180
02:49:39,760 --> 02:49:40,920
What happened?

2181
02:49:41,480 --> 02:49:43,640
I just, I don't know.

2182
02:49:44,120 --> 02:49:44,820
I don't know.

2183
02:49:45,080 --> 02:49:45,370
I don't.

2184
02:49:47,260 --> 02:49:48,020
That's not.

2185
02:49:48,560 --> 02:49:49,480
Alright, guys.

2186
02:49:49,940 --> 02:49:50,600
I will say.

2187
02:49:51,780 --> 02:49:53,900
I'll never carry an Eva 8 again.

2188
02:49:54,140 --> 02:49:54,520
I'll never.

2189
02:49:54,700 --> 02:49:57,160
Look, we saw me hit every shot on R9.

2190
02:49:57,180 --> 02:49:57,640
R9.

2191
02:49:58,240 --> 02:50:00,100
You can't say that.

2192
02:50:00,520 --> 02:50:01,720
You can't.

2193
02:50:04,040 --> 02:50:07,240
I hid everything on the R9.

2194
02:50:08,760 --> 02:50:10,060
The E of 8 on the other hand.

2195
02:50:10,180 --> 02:50:11,320
We just don't talk about that.

2196
02:50:11,660 --> 02:50:12,140
We don't talk.

2197
02:50:14,880 --> 02:50:18,260
She was an R9 girl.

2198
02:50:18,480 --> 02:50:19,660
He was an E8 boy.

2199
02:50:19,940 --> 02:50:22,400
Can I make it any more obvious?

2200
02:50:22,840 --> 02:50:25,220
I'm going to have to rethink about meaning.

2201
02:50:25,580 --> 02:50:26,340
Okay, look.

2202
02:50:26,720 --> 02:50:27,000
Look.

2203
02:50:27,180 --> 02:50:29,600
It's, look, this game, I'll prove you guys right.

2204
02:50:29,740 --> 02:50:31,820
It's just, the Eva ate, okay?

2205
02:50:32,160 --> 02:50:33,760
The, it's because it wasn't a PK.

2206
02:50:33,940 --> 02:50:36,920
If it was a PK, that'd be a different story, guys.

2207
02:50:37,300 --> 02:50:44,460
If it was, if it was a PK, it would have been a different
story, okay?

2208
02:50:44,780 --> 02:50:52,720
It would be, it was just, you know, just Eva ate things.

2209
02:50:53,320 --> 02:50:54,640
I say, Hasako.

2210
02:50:54,840 --> 02:50:56,900
It's just Eva ate things.

2211
02:51:00,780 --> 02:51:03,120
You should have seen me with a PK.

2212
02:51:05,920 --> 02:51:07,460
Yeah, I'll prove you guys wrong.

2213
02:51:07,540 --> 02:51:08,080
Right here.

2214
02:51:08,240 --> 02:51:08,540
Right here.

2215
02:51:08,540 --> 02:51:11,020
I'll pick up a PK and then I'll hit every shot.

2216
02:51:12,020 --> 02:51:13,240
I'll prove you guys wrong.

2217
02:51:13,280 --> 02:51:14,640
Right here in this game.

2218
02:51:15,100 --> 02:51:16,900
Yeah, my mouth tweaked out a little bit too.

2219
02:51:16,980 --> 02:51:17,780
It was a little bit of ping.

2220
02:51:17,840 --> 02:51:18,800
I was pinged too.

2221
02:51:19,120 --> 02:51:19,700
It was...

2222
02:51:22,380 --> 02:51:23,100
Guys, guys.

2223
02:51:28,390 --> 02:51:40,090

2225
02:51:49,930 --> 02:51:53,530

2229
02:52:32,410 --> 02:52:34,390
Now that I'm an alternator, it's different.

2230
02:52:38,370 --> 02:52:38,890
Okay.

2231
02:52:42,450 --> 02:52:44,910
I walked down the wrong alley.

2232
02:52:45,590 --> 02:52:45,990
Exactly.

2233
02:52:46,310 --> 02:52:46,890
It's different now.

2234
02:52:46,970 --> 02:52:47,990
I got the guns I need.

2235
02:52:48,770 --> 02:52:50,170
I also don't think I should play Horizon.

2236
02:52:50,370 --> 02:52:52,430
I'm not really feeling Horizon for this.

2237
02:52:57,920 --> 02:52:58,500
Where are they?

2238
02:52:59,560 --> 02:53:01,600
I legit not feeling Horizon though.

2239
02:53:04,320 --> 02:53:05,600
Are you serious?

2240
02:53:05,980 --> 02:53:07,640
That's around the corner.

2241
02:53:08,800 --> 02:53:11,280
I actually got like shot bullet curve.

2242
02:53:12,320 --> 02:53:12,980
Oh shit.

2243
02:53:13,040 --> 02:53:13,840
I don't know, man.

2244
02:53:14,420 --> 02:53:15,720
There's a wall there.

2245
02:53:20,280 --> 02:53:21,880
Bro, that guy fucking curved the bullet.

2246
02:53:22,080 --> 02:53:23,520
Like what am I supposed to do?

2247
02:53:25,240 --> 02:53:26,800
He curved the bullet.

2248
02:53:27,380 --> 02:53:29,720
Okay, after this game, it'll be different.

2249
02:53:30,180 --> 02:53:31,060
After this game.

2250
02:53:31,400 --> 02:53:32,480
Bro, curved the bullet.

2251
02:53:32,700 --> 02:53:33,440
What can I do?

2252
02:53:37,220 --> 02:53:42,320
Okay, after this game Which monitor was turned off?

2253
02:53:42,480 --> 02:53:50,560
I'm kind of new and would like to know Mr. Fluggins, thank
you, Mr. Chat, thank you, thank you No, we all saw the

2254
02:53:50,560 --> 02:53:55,820
bullet curve chat I was literally on the right side

2255
02:53:59,470 --> 02:54:00,590
Is he scared?

2256
02:54:00,690 --> 02:54:01,930
Why is he not raising his buddy?

2257
02:54:05,190 --> 02:54:06,550
Okay, this right here.

2258
02:54:06,910 --> 02:54:07,390
Right here.

2259
02:54:07,610 --> 02:54:11,590
The moment they get me, I'm going to go like ultra instinct
mode.

2260
02:54:13,170 --> 02:54:13,750
Right here.

2261
02:54:19,230 --> 02:54:21,790
And the moment I get an R9, I just need an R9.

2262
02:54:25,770 --> 02:54:29,210
I need, okay, first off, I need an R9 and I need a PK.

2263
02:54:30,150 --> 02:54:31,550
And then everything will be different.

2264
02:54:32,270 --> 02:54:32,650
Look at that!

2265
02:54:32,930 --> 02:54:33,550
Look at that!

2266
02:54:33,770 --> 02:54:34,350
This guy!

2267
02:54:34,470 --> 02:54:35,250
Look at him!

2268
02:54:35,570 --> 02:54:35,970
P20!

2269
02:54:36,190 --> 02:54:36,730
Look at him!

2270
02:54:36,850 --> 02:54:38,350
He fucking went...

2271
02:54:38,350 --> 02:54:41,930
He only hit one shot on the P20, guys.

2272
02:54:42,210 --> 02:54:42,830
Come on.

2273
02:54:42,990 --> 02:54:45,950
He hit one shot on the P20.

2274
02:54:46,430 --> 02:54:49,010
At least I hit more than one shot.

2275
02:54:51,930 --> 02:54:53,310
Come on.

2276
02:54:58,370 --> 02:54:59,850
Come on.

2277
02:55:00,450 --> 02:55:02,750
If anything, at least I wasn't like that.

2278
02:55:04,890 --> 02:55:05,890
Hatching myself up.

2279
02:55:07,430 --> 02:55:09,350
Okay, it's fine.

2280
02:55:11,790 --> 02:55:13,670
You should really swap the P20.

2281
02:55:14,550 --> 02:55:15,390
He doesn't even have...

2282
02:55:15,390 --> 02:55:16,550
Does he even have hammerpoint?

2283
02:55:16,670 --> 02:55:18,770
Or does he need to...

2284
02:55:19,810 --> 02:55:20,850
Oh my god.

2285
02:55:20,990 --> 02:55:22,490
Did he just get that for free?

2286
02:55:22,730 --> 02:55:23,450

It's a good thing I don't have a ring camera.

2316
02:59:57,890 --> 02:59:58,910
I live in an apartment.

2317
03:00:00,470 --> 03:00:01,530
I don't know what to play.

2318
03:00:02,930 --> 03:00:03,890

2319
03:00:04,210 --> 03:00:05,130
I'll try Catalyst again.

2320
03:00:05,290 --> 03:00:05,990
I think Catalyst.

2321
03:00:07,170 --> 03:00:09,670
Catalyst was like the most successful.

2322
03:00:25,040 --> 03:00:26,540
Alright, here we go.

2323
03:00:39,810 --> 03:00:40,170
Nope.

2324
03:00:41,070 --> 03:00:42,030
Alright, I'm locking in.

2325
03:00:42,070 --> 03:00:42,970
For real this time.

2326
03:00:43,430 --> 03:00:45,110
I'm no longer fucking around, guys.

2327
03:00:48,470 --> 03:00:51,910
Don't worry, I'm not fucking around this time.

2328
03:00:52,210 --> 03:00:53,930
I'm so locked in for real.

2329
03:00:55,230 --> 03:00:59,450
I need to like not challenge people too much because I don't
know their controller or not.

2330
03:01:01,950 --> 03:01:02,910
Locking in.

2331
03:01:04,170 --> 03:01:07,950
I just stopped thinking I can out- I can out aim a roller
player.

2332
03:01:10,370 --> 03:01:11,290
Oh fuck, okay.

2333
03:01:11,610 --> 03:01:12,670
It's okay I didn't need a gun.

2334
03:01:13,550 --> 03:01:13,610
Okay.

2335
03:01:14,130 --> 03:01:15,330
It's so weird.

2336
03:01:15,450 --> 03:01:17,390
I think the energy gun is so weird.

2337
03:01:17,410 --> 03:01:17,990
so weird.

2338
03:01:18,710 --> 03:01:20,110
I don't know if I'm a fan of it.

2339
03:01:23,170 --> 03:01:23,850
I don't think so.

2340
03:01:23,950 --> 03:01:24,810
You know, I don't think I'm...

2341
03:01:24,810 --> 03:01:26,590
Actually, I'm not a fan of the energy.

2342
03:01:26,950 --> 03:01:29,150
Really, it feels way too weird.

2343
03:01:31,170 --> 03:01:34,590
Yeah, as soon as we get that R9 and PK, it's over.

2344
03:01:44,120 --> 03:01:44,980
That's where it hurts.

2345
03:01:52,240 --> 03:01:53,040
He's so...

2346
03:01:53,480 --> 03:01:54,760
Looks like the next ring

2347
03:01:59,900 --> 03:02:07,750
Oh my god, he's actually won!

2348
03:02:10,830 --> 03:02:12,750
Oh my god, I will kill you.

2349
03:02:20,140 --> 03:02:20,820
There you go.

2350
03:02:25,730 --> 03:02:26,630
Wait, this guy's not real.

2351
03:02:30,280 --> 03:02:32,000
I don't think this guy was real.

2352
03:02:32,660 --> 03:02:33,420
Oh my god, there it is!

2353
03:02:33,520 --> 03:02:33,960
There it is!

2354
03:02:33,960 --> 03:02:35,560
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, it's here.

2355
03:02:36,280 --> 03:02:36,740
It's here.

2356
03:02:39,120 --> 03:02:40,240
It's actually here.

2357
03:02:41,580 --> 03:02:42,840
It's actually here.

2358
03:02:43,080 --> 03:02:49,240
We don't actually we don't even need Actually faster
activation Spikes are hidden.

2359
03:02:49,460 --> 03:02:56,260
Alright It's actually here I don't know That's the thing.

2360
03:02:56,800 --> 03:03:05,860
Last time I thought People were bots and then I Asked like a
I got one of the really bad players In my game On my team

2361
03:03:05,860 --> 03:03:12,400
and then like I asked Him if he's real or not like are you A
real person and then he responded It was like, I'm so sorry.

2362
03:03:12,540 --> 03:03:14,360
I thought you were like an actual bot.

2363
03:03:14,760 --> 03:03:16,280
So like, I can't tell anymore.

2364
03:03:18,780 --> 03:03:20,900
I can't tell if they're real or not.

2365
03:03:21,120 --> 03:03:23,000
I can't make assumptions anymore.

2366
03:03:23,620 --> 03:03:27,020
I actually can't.

2367
03:03:29,260 --> 03:03:31,840
I literally called like a fucking dev a bot.

2368
03:03:41,730 --> 03:03:42,170
Oh, man.

2369
03:03:42,410 --> 03:03:43,730
We have a care package on the way.

2370
03:03:48,780 --> 03:03:49,260
Okay.

2371
03:03:51,440 --> 03:03:52,260
You're never...

2372
03:03:52,260 --> 03:03:53,640
This was like years ago.

2373
03:03:53,700 --> 03:03:55,600
This was like two or three years ago.

2374
03:03:55,940 --> 03:04:00,380
Because when early access was not streamable, it was just
like...

2375
03:04:00,380 --> 03:04:02,860
You get a sneak peek, but you can only record it.

2376
03:04:11,720 --> 03:04:13,120
I think they finished their fight.

2377
03:04:16,990 --> 03:04:17,490
Oh, shit.

2378
03:04:17,570 --> 03:04:17,930
Nice.

2379
03:04:25,820 --> 03:04:26,320
Nice.

2380
03:04:34,640 --> 03:04:35,440
That's fine.

2381
03:04:45,580 --> 03:04:46,340
There we go.

2382
03:04:47,340 --> 03:04:48,180
Alright, that's fine.

2383
03:04:48,200 --> 03:04:48,560
fine.

2384
03:04:50,640 --> 03:04:53,140
It was worth it.

2385
03:04:53,420 --> 03:04:54,240
Okay, I didn't think that.

2386
03:04:54,320 --> 03:04:55,220
I don't think we needed that.

2387
03:04:55,440 --> 03:04:57,240
But, like, other than that, it was worth it.

2388
03:04:57,660 --> 03:04:57,920
See?

2389
03:05:00,300 --> 03:05:05,380
I didn't think we needed the second ult, but, like, the
first ult was fine.

2390
03:05:05,500 --> 03:05:06,320
My ult was fine.

2391
03:05:11,930 --> 03:05:13,030
Ooh, I'm scared.

2392
03:05:13,770 --> 03:05:15,010
Watch this.

2393
03:05:17,870 --> 03:05:20,130
Okay, I still got it, guys.

2394
03:05:20,550 --> 03:05:20,730
I,

2395
03:05:24,090 --> 03:05:26,970
I still got it.

2396
03:05:27,830 --> 03:05:28,630
Oh, shit.

2397
03:05:28,750 --> 03:05:31,350
For some reason, I thought that was our fucking...

2398
03:05:35,430 --> 03:05:36,470
Oh, no.

2399
03:05:37,510 --> 03:05:38,850
I need that armor swap.

2400
03:05:39,350 --> 03:05:39,590
For real.

2401
03:05:45,990 --> 03:05:47,470
What the fuck?

2402
03:05:48,570 --> 03:05:49,790
They're on my thing.

2403
03:05:50,790 --> 03:05:51,250
Yeah.

2404
03:05:55,610 --> 03:05:57,450
Oh, I can follow that.

2405
03:05:59,010 --> 03:05:59,710
It's unlucky.

2406
03:06:01,950 --> 03:06:03,490
Oh, he's fucking crazy for that.

2407
03:06:05,790 --> 03:06:07,530
His teammates are here, too.

2408
03:06:08,810 --> 03:06:09,430
Oh, my God.

2409
03:06:09,530 --> 03:06:10,630
He body-blocked me.

2410
03:06:16,730 --> 03:06:17,210
Fuck.

2411
03:06:22,660 --> 03:06:23,140
No!

2412
03:06:24,360 --> 03:06:26,220
He got the knock on my teammate.

2413
03:06:26,360 --> 03:06:28,000
Oh, it's a third team.

2414
03:06:28,720 --> 03:06:29,740
Oh, my God.

2415
03:06:29,820 --> 03:06:30,660
It was two teams.

2416
03:06:30,680 --> 03:06:32,440
Look, I did my job.

2417
03:06:32,600 --> 03:06:33,840
I did my job, though.

2418
03:06:34,140 --> 03:06:39,700
I did everything that I could do.

2419
03:06:40,520 --> 03:06:42,320
Yeah, that's not on me.

2420
03:06:42,480 --> 03:06:43,820
That's not on me.

2421
03:06:44,840 --> 03:06:46,480
I played that perfectly.

2422
03:06:46,720 --> 03:06:48,020
Oh, then we had that Lifeline.

2423
03:06:48,280 --> 03:06:48,700
Lifeline.

2424
03:06:51,240 --> 03:06:54,620
I don't know why Lifeline fucking ran in there.

2425
03:06:54,760 --> 03:06:56,900
I got, she was crazy for that.

2426
03:06:57,320 --> 03:06:59,080
She was actually crazy for doing that.

2427
03:07:01,800 --> 03:07:03,720
Yeah, I was like, your lifeline, bro.

2428
03:07:03,860 --> 03:07:05,180
What the fuck are you doing?

2429
03:07:07,640 --> 03:07:11,500
Like, there was an entire team on the far right.

2430
03:07:11,860 --> 03:07:12,700
You crazy.

2431
03:07:13,920 --> 03:07:15,500
Entry frag lifeline.

2432
03:07:20,200 --> 03:07:21,720
I don't think that was it.

2433
03:07:21,880 --> 03:07:25,580
I don't think entry frag lifeline was the key to success.

2434
03:07:28,480 --> 03:07:30,660
I think if she, like, had...

2435
03:07:30,680 --> 03:07:38,420
her up it would have been fine too she just didn't have her
up she literally wasted uh with the res like she was so

What was I supposed to do?

2504
03:17:50,120 --> 03:17:51,440
I told you it wasn't.

2505
03:17:51,720 --> 03:17:52,480
Look at that.

2506
03:17:52,880 --> 03:17:58,260
I was in the fight the least amount of time, and I had the
most damage.

2507
03:17:59,640 --> 03:18:00,800
I was in there.

2508
03:18:00,900 --> 03:18:01,860
Yeah, I got sandwiched.

2509
03:18:01,980 --> 03:18:03,140
All right, there's nothing I could do.

2510
03:18:03,660 --> 03:18:05,180
I didn't betray it.

2511
03:18:07,420 --> 03:18:08,580
I got pinched.

2512
03:18:08,620 --> 03:18:10,560
I almost killed that Bloodhound, too.

2513
03:18:10,620 --> 03:18:11,500
I almost killed it.

2514
03:18:12,340 --> 03:18:14,760
Between a rock and a hard place.

2515
03:18:14,820 --> 03:18:15,360
Look at this.

2516
03:18:18,480 --> 03:18:21,220
Told you it wasn't me, it was the guns.

2517
03:18:21,820 --> 03:18:24,420
Got my two guns and then I was...

2518
03:18:24,420 --> 03:18:26,040
I was fucking...

2519
03:18:30,000 --> 03:18:31,200
Classic Apex.

2520
03:18:31,860 --> 03:18:32,460
Ducky...

2521
03:18:33,220 --> 03:18:34,960
Smoking a cigarette gift.

2522
03:18:42,430 --> 03:18:44,070
See, I wasn't working.

2523
03:18:44,090 --> 03:18:44,470
washed.

2524
03:18:44,610 --> 03:18:45,810
It was the gun all along.

2525
03:18:46,030 --> 03:18:46,530
I knew it.

2526
03:18:47,030 --> 03:18:48,130
I knew it.

2527
03:19:00,380 --> 03:19:01,480
There we go.

2528
03:19:05,890 --> 03:19:06,990
No, the fuse is gone.

2529
03:19:07,250 --> 03:19:10,910
He like, he literally checked in for 30 minutes and then
never came back.

2530
03:19:11,370 --> 03:19:13,250
I don't know what the fuck happened to that man.

2531
03:19:17,390 --> 03:19:19,550
Maybe even got chance to try him out.

2532
03:19:31,930 --> 03:19:32,290
Alright.

2533
03:19:34,350 --> 03:19:34,650

Okay, that tracking is insane.

2541
03:20:26,130 --> 03:20:27,490
That was insane tracking right there.

2542
03:20:28,250 --> 03:20:31,790
I was not expecting, like, instant God.

2543
03:20:33,610 --> 03:20:36,470
I was not expecting my HP to just disappear.

2544
03:20:38,290 --> 03:20:39,690
Like, actually, disappear!

2545
03:20:41,990 --> 03:20:43,710

How did he crawl that far?

2548
03:20:55,040 --> 03:20:56,570
Almost ran into that.

2549
03:21:02,350 --> 03:21:04,070
I hear someone on my left.

2550
03:21:05,130 --> 03:21:06,890

03:21:10,130 --> 03:21:11,570

I am so confused.

2560
03:22:37,880 --> 03:22:39,240
God, okay, that's fine.

2561
03:22:41,580 --> 03:22:41,880
He's one.

2562
03:22:42,000 --> 03:22:42,500
He's solo.

2563
03:22:42,940 --> 03:22:43,580
He is solo.

2564
03:22:44,140 --> 03:22:44,460
Yay!

2565
03:22:46,380 --> 03:22:48,140

Like, actually, what fucking hell am I in?

2567
03:22:51,320 --> 03:22:52,660
Welcome to capital city.

2568
03:22:58,850 --> 03:22:59,590
Oh, wait, they're Rezi.

2569
03:23:02,370 --> 03:23:03,890
Like, what is this?

2570
03:23:04,470 --> 03:23:06,410
Look at the fucking capital city.

2571
03:23:06,570 --> 03:23:08,590
I never have a chance to res.

2572
03:23:14,940 --> 03:23:16,220
Oh, he's doing it again.

2573
03:23:17,440 --> 03:23:18,540
Is he actually on lem res?

2574
03:23:18,640 --> 03:23:19,300
He's going to do it.

03:23:19,620 --> 03:23:22,180
Oh, he fucked up.

2576
03:23:23,100 --> 03:23:23,220
Oh.

2577
03:23:26,120 --> 03:23:28,960
I never had a chance to get an actual gun.

2578
03:23:29,360 --> 03:23:30,060
That makes me so...

2579
03:23:30,060 --> 03:23:30,320
Oh, my God.

2580
03:23:30,380 --> 03:23:32,260
We have five minutes before they close the server.

2581
03:23:32,700 --> 03:23:32,880
We have...

2582
03:23:32,880 --> 03:23:33,260

2589
03:24:12,380 --> 03:24:15,120
And then, like, they don't have to fucking go through hell.

2590
03:24:16,200 --> 03:24:18,320
They didn't have to go through absolute hell.

2591
03:24:21,560 --> 03:24:24,940
Yeah, the old Matt, the guy, the fuse was really good.

2592
03:24:27,560 --> 03:24:28,380
Oh my god, wait.

2593
03:24:28,900 --> 03:24:30,320

Oh.

2599
03:25:14,630 --> 03:25:16,230
Well, Edge, my favorite.

2600
03:25:18,850 --> 03:25:20,890
Bro, I don't want to go back to Fragment.

2601
03:25:21,610 --> 03:25:28,350
We're always like, every time we go to Fragment, we're
always like the last, like the second last team to die in

2602
03:25:28,350 --> 03:25:28,750
Fragment.

2603
03:25:29,230 --> 03:25:35,450
We like fight for our lives and then we're the second last
team and then the last team comes in and cleans up.

2604
03:25:36,150 --> 03:25:37,170
I have no HP.

2605
03:25:37,670 --> 03:25:38,910
I have no more heals.

2606
03:25:41,210 --> 03:25:45,030
Oh my god, okay, that's alright.

2607
03:25:45,870 --> 03:25:47,030
I mean at least I get an art.

2608
03:25:49,890 --> 03:25:52,230
Oh my god, not the double P20.

2609
03:25:55,190 --> 03:25:59,210
Anything else, any other decent gun.

2610
03:26:00,370 --> 03:26:03,050
Ah, I'll take the prowler over it.

2611
03:26:03,310 --> 03:26:04,030
Take the prowler.

2612
03:26:09,330 --> 03:26:10,350
That's unlucky.

2613
03:26:11,590 --> 03:26:12,770
I'll take the prowler.

2614
03:26:22,900 --> 03:26:24,780
I hate these players.

2615
03:26:27,020 --> 03:26:28,040
What the fuck?

2616
03:26:30,360 --> 03:26:32,140
Oh my god, I hate these players.

2617
03:26:32,920 --> 03:26:33,820
That's what I mean.

2618
03:26:33,920 --> 03:26:34,720
Those are the...

2619
03:26:34,720 --> 03:26:37,040
They know how...

2620
03:26:37,040 --> 03:26:39,060
They know how to do the movement.

2621
03:26:39,720 --> 03:26:40,820
This guy never stopped.

2622
03:26:42,120 --> 03:26:43,020
They never...

2623
03:26:43,020 --> 03:26:45,380
They never stopped.

2624
03:26:52,110 --> 03:26:59,450
no that's like for those who like figured it out i haven't
figured it out no those are literally the people who have

2625
03:26:59,450 --> 03:27:03,570
like octane montages they've been doing the sun's octane
first game out

2626
03:27:06,950 --> 03:27:12,110

gun

03:27:19,360 --> 03:27:28,080
his tick tock clips okay guys he needs it he needs to tick i
i should have punched him he knew he was not in punching

as i saw it i was like whatever just like i was just like

2629
03:27:41,980 --> 03:27:45,960
i've accepted my fate i knew what kind of player he is

2630
03:27:53,230 --> 03:27:55,630
What kind of player this man is?

2631
03:28:17,910 --> 03:28:20,530
I would get, I could not win.

2632
03:28:20,950 --> 03:28:25,370
I, I knew how it was going to happen.

2633
03:28:25,910 --> 03:28:31,520
I'm the jump master.

2634
03:28:32,280 --> 03:28:33,000
Why me?

2635
03:28:37,170 --> 03:28:38,470
Have faith in off descent.

2636
03:28:41,410 --> 03:28:42,630
Prepare for battle.

2637
03:28:58,120 --> 03:28:58,920
Alright.

2638
03:29:00,420 --> 03:29:01,220
Last.

2639
03:29:01,240 --> 03:29:16,000
of near me where why oh my god charge rifle and a p20 okay

2640
03:29:16,000 --> 03:29:28,340
and a p20 all right like fuck me like like who am i supposed
to kill that good

2641
03:29:32,660 --> 03:29:34,220
I need to grab that one, none.

2642
03:29:35,860 --> 03:29:37,440
The perfect setup.

2643
03:29:41,910 --> 03:29:42,950
I got up on it.

2644
03:29:43,310 --> 03:29:43,930
Oh, never mind.

2645
03:29:44,790 --> 03:29:46,930
Oh, I still got up on it in time.

2646
03:29:56,480 --> 03:29:58,020
But yeah, I'm so...

2647
03:29:58,020 --> 03:29:58,240
Alright.

2648
03:29:59,180 --> 03:29:59,620
Alright.

2649
03:30:00,080 --> 03:30:01,540
I'm gonna run Watson for the next one.

2650
03:30:01,660 --> 03:30:03,180
Next one is like a...

2651
03:30:03,180 --> 03:30:04,820
It's like wild cards.

2652
03:30:04,900 --> 03:30:07,700
I don't know what wild cards it is for early access.

2653
03:30:09,880 --> 03:30:10,940
But we'll run...

2654
03:30:12,140 --> 03:30:14,140
We'll run Watson for the next game.

2655
03:30:14,360 --> 03:30:18,240
Because I think they said that the pubs closed at 530.

2656
03:30:21,320 --> 03:30:23,280
I'm going to be able to hit it.

2657
03:30:23,380 --> 03:30:23,800
Yay!

2658
03:30:24,460 --> 03:30:24,980
Yay!

2659
03:30:32,530 --> 03:30:34,370
I'm really happy to get a skin.

2660
03:30:34,650 --> 03:30:42,590
I feel like the reason why I chose the skin, too, is because
I felt like for banners, no one really looks at the banners,

2661
03:30:42,790 --> 03:30:43,130
you know?

2662
03:30:43,590 --> 03:30:45,070
No one really looks at it.

2663
03:30:45,330 --> 03:30:52,610
anything um it's just for uh because like especially you're
like you got master pred then you just put on the master

2664
03:30:52,610 --> 03:30:59,890
pred banner because it's just more more prestige so i felt
like and then like and then obviously it was like oh my god

2665
03:30:59,890 --> 03:31:10,990
what the what oh my god no i don't think they're there's
just no way yeah these guys there's no way these guys are

2666
03:31:10,990 --> 03:31:12,410
not real for sure

2667
03:31:15,530 --> 03:31:16,410
Yeah, no.

2668
03:31:16,870 --> 03:31:17,610
That, their bots.

2669
03:31:17,870 --> 03:31:18,890
No, their bots.

2670
03:31:19,110 --> 03:31:19,810
They're bots.

2671
03:31:22,450 --> 03:31:25,130
Those are 100% bots.

2672
03:31:32,610 --> 03:31:33,570
For sure.

2673
03:31:34,030 --> 03:31:37,530
Well, the Watson skin, you don't have to pay for it.

2674
03:31:37,870 --> 03:31:38,330
It's free.

2675
03:31:38,710 --> 03:31:40,190
You just have to do challenges for it.

2676
03:31:40,250 --> 03:31:41,390
You have to earn challenge points.

2677
03:31:41,710 --> 03:31:43,650
So it's just more so of grinding to get the skin.

2678
03:31:48,300 --> 03:31:49,380
Unless that was a baby.

2679
03:31:51,000 --> 03:31:59,200
real but yeah like i thought like uh banners like i feel
like no one really would use this banners in general or like

2680
03:31:59,200 --> 03:32:04,740
no one really looks at banners in general especially like
when you're and and they only last for like you know one

2681
03:32:04,740 --> 03:32:12,600
second you know from the character select like from the
character select um and then like other than that i would

2682
03:32:12,600 --> 03:32:21,520
have liked a gun skin my second choice so my first choice
was character skin second and also stat trackers too yeah It

2683
03:32:21,520 --> 03:32:22,100
is limited.

2684
03:32:22,340 --> 03:32:24,960
It's 7th year anniversary, so you have a limited time to get
it.

2685
03:32:31,690 --> 03:32:32,730
Actually, I don't remember.

2686
03:32:32,990 --> 03:32:33,530
Is it limited?

2687
03:32:33,790 --> 03:32:34,470
I don't remember.

2688
03:32:34,470 --> 03:32:38,430
I remember I got like some anniversary skins after it came
out.

2689
03:32:41,870 --> 03:32:43,150
There's that way.

2690
03:32:43,270 --> 03:32:44,490
Do you want to fight that team?

2691
03:32:44,910 --> 03:32:46,070
Or that team?

2692
03:32:47,050 --> 03:32:47,630
Which team?

2693
03:32:48,610 --> 03:32:49,650
Yeah, so I'm happy.

2694
03:32:50,430 --> 03:32:53,690
Because I want it to be usable for people who don't know me
and people who know me.

2695
03:33:00,400 --> 03:33:12,160
ends yeah so it only is a little bit of grinding to get it
but you know i feel like it's worth it oh my god they have

2696
03:33:12,160 --> 03:33:15,260
windows now for this you can't just nade into it

2697
03:33:20,260 --> 03:33:34,250
now you have to be good at apex to get the challenge points
oh i can ult this where is this plan um i can't i'm not

2698
03:33:34,250 --> 03:33:45,130
entry fragging this if that's what he's thinking i can't
entry frag this guys i'm literally the support what there's

2699
03:33:45,130 --> 03:33:50,890
an evil harvester here okay that guy is not real

2700
03:33:54,220 --> 03:33:56,040
he ulted for no reason

2701
03:34:02,280 --> 03:34:05,200
Okay, I think I can recognize the bot names.

2702
03:34:06,500 --> 03:34:09,280
I think it's because it's an early access, so they have to
fill it up with bots.

2703
03:34:11,780 --> 03:34:12,300
I feel like...

2704
03:34:12,300 --> 03:34:13,940
I think...

2705
03:34:13,940 --> 03:34:14,940
I don't know which is better.

2706
03:34:15,160 --> 03:34:16,200
Increase Ultimate Lifetime.

2707
03:34:16,420 --> 03:34:17,240
I feel like...

2708
03:34:17,240 --> 03:34:17,640
Doors.

2709
03:34:18,280 --> 03:34:18,540
Alright.

2710
03:34:19,580 --> 03:34:21,060
It's not a full bot lobby.

2711
03:34:21,200 --> 03:34:22,280
I think it's half-half.

2712
03:34:22,360 --> 03:34:23,820
Half bots, half real players.

2713
03:34:24,100 --> 03:34:26,040
They have to, though, because it's like...

2714
03:34:26,040 --> 03:34:27,500
Or like, you gotta wait for a very...

2715
03:34:27,500 --> 03:34:29,420
I thought those aren't real players, right?

2716
03:34:30,920 --> 03:34:31,340
Okay.

2717
03:34:32,080 --> 03:34:33,000
No, they're real.

2718
03:34:34,100 --> 03:34:34,860
They're real, they ulted.

2719
03:34:36,440 --> 03:34:38,500
I know they're real because they ulted.

2720
03:34:42,980 --> 03:34:45,680
Let's go out at the same time.

2721
03:34:51,730 --> 03:34:53,190
My ult goes down first though.

2722
03:34:53,930 --> 03:34:54,630
Another squad?

2723
03:34:57,190 --> 03:34:58,750
Fuck, I'm stuck here.

2724
03:35:04,390 --> 03:35:05,130
That's unlucky.

2725
03:35:05,450 --> 03:35:06,850
That team, that's a real team.

2726
03:35:10,680 --> 03:35:11,100
Oh!

2727
03:35:11,800 --> 03:35:13,080
I almost killed him too.

2728
03:35:13,560 --> 03:35:16,120
But I saw my team back out, so I didn't want to risk it.

2729
03:35:26,400 --> 03:35:27,200
Yeah, see.

2730
03:35:38,520 --> 03:35:40,540
Oh my god, we're getting...

2731
03:35:40,540 --> 03:35:41,500
Where's the other...

2732
03:35:41,500 --> 03:35:42,980
Oh my god, N!

2733
03:35:49,440 --> 03:35:49,740

2734
03:35:49,960 --> 03:35:50,440

2735
03:35:50,780 --> 03:35:51,480
Drop the portal!

2736
03:35:56,670 --> 03:35:57,410

03:35:59,950 --> 03:36:01,250
Okay, okay, he's got a cover.

2738
03:36:01,410 --> 03:36:02,250
He's got a cover.

2739
03:36:04,670 --> 03:36:05,730
I put a...

2740
03:36:05,730 --> 03:36:07,450
I put a thing there, so we should be fine.

2741
03:36:08,990 --> 03:36:16,690
I'll put two too just to be sure At least he dropped the
portal that's all I needed

2742
03:36:20,270 --> 03:36:26,990
Oh my god that's a full team too Bro that guy is fucking
crazy for going

2743
03:36:31,910 --> 03:36:36,270

2749
03:38:01,600 --> 03:38:04,060
I can finally customize.

2750
03:38:04,440 --> 03:38:05,680
It's like all I wanted.

2751
03:38:06,280 --> 03:38:07,320
We're still rookie badge.

2752
03:38:07,440 --> 03:38:08,480
Oh, it's only bronze.

2753
03:38:08,760 --> 03:38:09,160
Alright, don't worry.

2754
03:38:13,300 --> 03:38:13,680
Wait.

2755
03:38:15,340 --> 03:38:17,820
Wait, I can't even wait a minute.

2756
03:38:21,360 --> 03:38:22,280
That's not fair.

2757
03:38:23,100 --> 03:38:24,100
I have no rights.

2758
03:38:26,340 --> 03:38:27,560

2761
03:38:32,440 --> 03:38:36,560
They put me in debt and I can't even put on badges.

2762
03:38:37,080 --> 03:38:41,180
And no, everyone else gets to put on cool badges.

2763
03:38:44,760 --> 03:38:45,580
What do I want?

2764
03:38:46,440 --> 03:38:47,520
What pose do I want?

2765
03:38:49,120 --> 03:38:50,800

03:44:54,630 --> 03:44:55,290

03:45:08,090 --> 03:45:08,850
It's a bloodhound.

They're right here.

2850
03:45:52,130 --> 03:45:53,030
They're right here.

2851
03:45:53,210 --> 03:45:53,590

03:46:14,070 --> 03:46:16,010
Where's the guy fucked up?

2857
03:46:20,890 --> 03:46:25,530

03:49:27,880 --> 03:49:29,700
I'm gonna have me pull back a little bit.

2906
03:49:36,900 --> 03:49:38,880

2915
03:50:11,580 --> 03:50:13,840
This team is finally gone.

2916
03:50:14,380 --> 03:50:17,100

He's finally gone.

2919
03:50:27,660 --> 03:50:30,660
Yeah, I'm also going to get some of this here.

2920
03:50:35,020 --> 03:50:38,140

I didn't even realize he was...

2931
03:51:49,760 --> 03:51:51,580
To be fair, I didn't realize he was there.

2932
03:51:52,000 --> 03:51:53,320

2933
03:51:54,180 --> 03:51:56,140

Because it was a 1v3.

2963
03:54:37,590 --> 03:54:39,830
That's why it felt like a 1v3.

Yeah, good luck, buddy.

2965
03:54:45,710 --> 03:54:48,350

2972
03:55:17,140 --> 03:55:18,220
It's the same thing.

2973
03:55:18,340 --> 03:55:19,280
It's just us too.

2974
03:55:25,350 --> 03:55:26,450
I'm trying to...

2975
03:55:30,590 --> 03:55:31,710
I'm gonna get closer.

2976
03:55:42,000 --> 03:55:43,460

They're back.

2979
03:55:58,690 --> 03:55:59,710
Oh my god, they're back.

2980
03:56:00,010 --> 03:56:01,470
I would love an R9 right now.

2981
03:56:01,690 --> 03:56:03,050
I hate the car so much.

2982
03:56:05,590 --> 03:56:07,170
I'm just not good with the car.

2983
03:56:13,230 --> 03:56:13,830
What the fuck?

2984
03:56:14,010 --> 03:56:14,870

2985
03:56:15,130 --> 03:56:15,470

2986
03:56:28,160 --> 03:56:28,660
You're new.

2987
03:56:29,900 --> 03:56:31,300
Oh my god, you're new.

2988
03:56:31,620 --> 03:56:32,260
I have

2989
03:56:36,410 --> 03:56:37,230
a pathfinder.

2990
03:56:38,250 --> 03:56:45,580

was someone up there I would not have landed there if I knew

2992
03:56:57,810 --> 03:57:04,570
oh my god I didn't realize because he had the fucking
advantage because I had to land.

2993
03:57:05,750 --> 03:57:07,210
He had to fucking...

2994
03:57:07,210 --> 03:57:10,330
I had to land and pull up my goddamn gun!

2995
03:57:11,090 --> 03:57:12,190
Also, I need an R9.

2996
03:57:12,430 --> 03:57:13,790
I hate the car so much.

2997
03:57:14,350 --> 03:57:17,450
I'm so used to aiming with R9 that fucks with my recoil
control.

2998
03:57:21,990 --> 03:57:22,450
Honestly...

2999
03:57:23,110 --> 03:57:24,450
God, damn it!

3000
03:57:32,890 --> 03:57:33,790
Oh, my God.

3001
03:57:33,870 --> 03:57:35,370
I thought that was a down guy for some reason.

3002
03:57:36,810 --> 03:57:37,430
Okay, they're...

3003
03:57:37,430 --> 03:57:38,210
They're two fighting.

3004
03:57:38,290 --> 03:57:38,730
They're fighting.

3005
03:57:39,030 --> 03:57:41,410
As long as I stay alive

3006
03:57:50,560 --> 03:57:51,680
That's fine.

3007
03:57:59,420 --> 03:58:02,840
Oh My god, what the fuck is going on?

3008
03:58:03,300 --> 03:58:05,800
I'm just trying to live long enough for my team to respawn

3009
03:58:12,550 --> 03:58:25,410

3013
03:59:05,350 --> 03:59:07,690
Wait, my second teammate already died?

3014
03:59:09,390 --> 03:59:10,710
Jesus Christ.

3015
03:59:13,110 --> 03:59:14,420
I didn't realize I was going to get rushed there.

3016
03:59:16,550 --> 03:59:22,050
Guys, I don't think Watson is the play for this game mode.

3017
03:59:22,570 --> 03:59:23,450

3018
03:59:24,950 --> 03:59:26,750
I really want to make...

3019
03:59:26,770 --> 03:59:29,870
Watson work, but she has no mobility.

3020
03:59:30,530 --> 03:59:35,710
She has no...

3021
03:59:35,710 --> 03:59:38,030
I don't know what to do.

3022
03:59:41,570 --> 03:59:43,030
But you gotta win with your...

3023
03:59:43,030 --> 03:59:43,850
That's true.

3024
03:59:43,930 --> 03:59:44,870
I could do it.

3025
03:59:45,290 --> 03:59:45,630
It's alright.

3026
03:59:45,810 --> 03:59:46,470
This is it.

3027
03:59:46,790 --> 03:59:48,090
No, I could do it.

3028
03:59:48,970 --> 03:59:51,610
I don't need mobility.

3029
03:59:51,910 --> 03:59:53,730
It feels would have been so helpful.

3030
03:59:54,170 --> 04:00:01,390
If he comes out of retirement, If only he'll come out of
retirement.

3031
04:00:02,250 --> 04:00:03,190
If only...

3032
04:00:06,870 --> 04:00:09,330
Do you see the old man?

3033
04:00:10,030 --> 04:00:11,450
I don't.

3034
04:00:14,150 --> 04:00:15,830
I believe in the skin.

3035
04:00:16,310 --> 04:00:18,270
Believe in the skin that believes in me.

3036
04:00:23,730 --> 04:00:26,510
See, I could have picked an octane skin.

3037
04:00:26,750 --> 04:00:28,670
Or maybe, like, you know...

3038
04:00:30,270 --> 04:00:33,310
Or maybe like a catalyst skin.

3039
04:00:33,870 --> 04:00:37,590
But Watson was what got me there in the first place.

3040
04:00:38,490 --> 04:00:40,690
She was loyal to me on day one.

3041
04:00:41,590 --> 04:00:44,230
I always remembered those that were there for me.

3042
04:00:45,730 --> 04:00:47,030
Or even Bangalore.

3043
04:00:48,870 --> 04:00:50,610
And she cute too.

3044
04:00:51,110 --> 04:00:51,630
She's cute.

3045
04:00:52,390 --> 04:00:53,470
Symbolism matters.

3046
04:00:53,730 --> 04:00:54,130
Exactly.

3047
04:00:56,390 --> 04:00:57,710
And she's a cutie.

3048
04:01:05,270 --> 04:01:06,770
Oh my god, okay.

3049
04:01:07,810 --> 04:01:10,090
I would really like a different gun.

3050
04:01:10,930 --> 04:01:14,890
I saw an R9 one time and it never happened again.

3051
04:01:17,330 --> 04:01:19,790
The one time I saw an R9.

3052
04:01:21,950 --> 04:01:24,370
The one that got away, chat.

3053
04:01:24,910 --> 04:01:26,710
Truly the one that got away.

3054
04:01:38,190 --> 04:01:40,030
We're not wrapping the EVA.

3055
04:01:41,570 --> 04:01:44,270
The one that got away.

3056
04:01:49,870 --> 04:01:52,370
I always hit my shots on the R.

3057
04:01:52,550 --> 04:01:53,850
Now, what are you talking about?

3058
04:01:55,050 --> 04:01:55,570
Oh, yeah.

3059
04:01:55,870 --> 04:01:56,410
You know what?

3060
04:01:56,670 --> 04:01:57,970
Let's try it.

3061
04:01:59,530 --> 04:02:00,970
You thought I could whiff?

3062
04:02:01,150 --> 04:02:02,110
I'll show you how.

3063
04:02:07,710 --> 04:02:09,950
I'll show you whiffing.

3064
04:02:13,570 --> 04:02:16,170

3065
04:02:23,950 --> 04:02:27,710
i'll show you what whiffing truly is

3066
04:02:36,940 --> 04:02:57,390
don't worry don't worry eventually what the fuck how was he

3067
04:02:57,390 --> 04:02:59,310

This entire time!

3069
04:03:04,790 --> 04:03:07,010
He just was just behind me.

3070
04:03:07,670 --> 04:03:08,610
That's crazy.

3071
04:03:11,070 --> 04:03:11,710
That's five.

3072
04:03:14,870 --> 04:03:15,550
See that?

3073
04:03:15,750 --> 04:03:16,670
I hit a shot.

3074
04:03:23,970 --> 04:03:24,630
There we go.

3075
04:03:30,730 --> 04:03:32,810
Yeah, I got my own- I got my own shit.

3076
04:03:34,930 --> 04:03:36,470
What the fuck?

3077
04:03:37,170 --> 04:03:38,670
What happened to that guy?

3078
04:03:39,630 --> 04:03:41,850
Oh my god, it doesn't stop.

3079
04:03:44,370 --> 04:03:45,590
I'm so scared.

3080
04:03:47,490 --> 04:03:48,590
There's someone above me.

3081
04:03:48,650 --> 04:03:49,810
I can hear him.

3082
04:03:51,950 --> 04:03:53,210
I literally can hear him.

3083
04:03:57,740 --> 04:04:01,020
I literally can hear this guy right above me right now.

3084
04:04:04,740 --> 04:04:05,860

Oh my god, I live for us.

3095
04:05:39,910 --> 04:05:40,170
One, zero.

3096
04:05:40,270 --> 04:05:40,610
There we go.

3097
04:05:40,690 --> 04:05:41,130
There we go.

3098
04:05:45,630 --> 04:05:46,290
All right, all right.

3099
04:05:46,570 --> 04:05:47,650
See, that's all it takes.

3100
04:05:49,190 --> 04:05:50,530
I'm going to go from this tunnel.

3101
04:05:52,970 --> 04:05:55,990
Okay, this is a little awkward now because I have no heals.

3102
04:06:00,300 --> 04:06:01,600
What the fuck do I...

3103
04:06:01,600 --> 04:06:02,920
Can I make it?

3104
04:06:12,020 --> 04:06:13,100
Okay, okay.

3105
04:06:13,860 --> 04:06:14,300
Don't worry.

3106
04:06:15,080 --> 04:06:15,640
Don't worry.

3107
04:06:16,120 --> 04:06:17,900
I will stay alive for us.

3108
04:06:18,080 --> 04:06:19,280
Don't worry.

3109
04:06:20,900 --> 04:06:21,740
Don't worry.

3110
04:06:26,350 --> 04:06:26,890
Okay.

3111
04:06:27,590 --> 04:06:30,470
The moment she lives, I'll come out of hiding.

3112
04:06:34,330 --> 04:06:36,050
Give me a sec.

3113
04:06:36,250 --> 04:06:38,250
I'll come out of hiding soon

3114
04:06:41,390 --> 04:06:47,810
Maybe not Why was he here?

3115
04:06:50,270 --> 04:06:51,650
Why were you here?

3116
04:07:09,150 --> 04:07:12,090
What the fuck?

3117
04:07:25,190 --> 04:07:25,910
No

3118
04:07:32,050 --> 04:07:36,470
I did Ow, is he still trying to kill me?

3119
04:07:36,910 --> 04:07:37,310
How?

3120
04:07:41,140 --> 04:07:44,780
I had two people, two people running at us.

3121
04:07:44,920 --> 04:07:45,540
Okay, I live.

3122
04:07:46,200 --> 04:07:46,680
It's okay.

3123
04:07:48,480 --> 04:07:53,260
I literally had two people run, like 20 people running at
me.

3124
04:07:53,340 --> 04:07:54,060
I got my R9.

3125
04:07:55,580 --> 04:07:58,680
I told you guys, the moment I get my R9, it's over.

3126
04:07:59,220 --> 04:08:00,500
I told you guys.

3127
04:08:01,540 --> 04:08:04,320
When I get that gun, it's fucking over for them.

3128
04:08:06,120 --> 04:08:07,580
It's all I needed.

3129
04:08:09,920 --> 04:08:11,060
I took...

3130
04:08:11,060 --> 04:08:12,720
Yeah, I took three!

3131
04:08:12,840 --> 04:08:13,760
I didn't even take two!

3132
04:08:29,010 --> 04:08:31,030
I'm coming back, guys.

3133
04:08:32,090 --> 04:08:32,470
Hello.

3134
04:08:43,840 --> 04:08:45,360
Oh my god, please.

04:08:54,570 --> 04:08:55,330
Oh, shit!

3136
04:08:55,690 --> 04:08:56,470
It didn't make me...

3137
04:09:02,570 --> 04:09:03,170
Please.

3138
04:09:04,890 --> 04:09:05,570
Jesus Christ!

3139
04:09:08,030 --> 04:09:09,710
I played out of my mind there!

3140
04:09:09,830 --> 04:09:11,050
I don't deserve to die!

3141
04:09:11,730 --> 04:09:16,450
I literally played out of my mind!

3142
04:09:19,230 --> 04:09:21,110
I told you I hit those.

3143
04:09:23,410 --> 04:09:24,450
I told you.

3144
04:09:27,250 --> 04:09:29,390

They actually left me.

3174
04:12:58,070 --> 04:12:59,490
They left me into the pit.

3175
04:13:00,850 --> 04:13:01,190
Oh my god.

3176
04:13:01,310 --> 04:13:02,050

Wait, I fucked up.

3178
04:13:03,850 --> 04:13:05,170
I didn't realize the time.

04:13:09,490 --> 04:13:09,870
Oh, no.

Okay.

3183
04:13:22,150 --> 04:13:23,590
Oh, this is so bad.

3184
04:13:28,320 --> 04:13:30,060
I am right behind them.

3185
04:13:36,540 --> 04:13:37,600

04:13:37,780 --> 04:13:38,820

3189
04:13:55,170 --> 04:13:56,310
Oh my god, they do.

04:13:56,550 --> 04:13:57,310
They do see me.

3191
04:14:05,090 --> 04:14:05,370

3192
04:14:06,070 --> 04:14:08,010

3193
04:14:12,850 --> 04:14:19,670

04:14:52,070 --> 04:14:55,630
I thought we were a team Like

3198
04:14:58,850 --> 04:15:09,750
They're like live And I was like okay And then they just
left They just left I couldn't go up The other team was

3199
04:15:09,750 --> 04:15:19,950
there I couldn't The other team was camping that zip So I
was waiting I was waning.

3200
04:15:23,450 --> 04:15:29,450
If only the other team wasn't camping in that fucking area.

3201
04:15:31,170 --> 04:15:32,970
I clutched that so much, though.

3202
04:15:38,850 --> 04:15:42,210
The fact that they didn't even come back for me made me so
sad.

3203
04:15:42,630 --> 04:15:45,390
They didn't even come back for me.

3204
04:15:45,810 --> 04:15:47,610
They were like, see ya.

3205
04:15:48,610 --> 04:15:49,970
They didn't even look back.

3206
04:15:50,510 --> 04:15:52,310
They actually did that to me twice.

3207
04:15:52,510 --> 04:15:57,970
I survived, I survived so they could rest like two times.

3208
04:15:58,190 --> 04:15:59,610
Remember the other hole I was in?

3209
04:15:59,950 --> 04:16:01,510
The other fucking hole?

3210
04:16:01,870 --> 04:16:05,070
And where I dragged three people down with me?

3211
04:16:05,350 --> 04:16:07,010
And .

3212
04:16:07,010 --> 04:16:09,510
Doki, I'm so sorry for kicking you in the head earlier.

3213
04:16:10,470 --> 04:16:13,590
Where I would drag three people down.

3214
04:16:16,160 --> 04:16:18,130
And it stayed fucking left.

3215
04:16:18,690 --> 04:16:20,090
Dude, thank you.

3216
04:16:22,930 --> 04:16:23,890
That's crazy.

3217
04:16:24,050 --> 04:16:25,430
I had some sick plays though.

3218
04:16:25,610 --> 04:16:26,930
I actually carry that shit.

3219
04:16:29,070 --> 04:16:30,370
I carry that shit hard.

3220
04:16:33,930 --> 04:16:35,530
I don't even remember who this guy is.

3221
04:16:35,710 --> 04:16:36,150
I'm sorry.

3222
04:16:37,810 --> 04:16:39,070
You're like, I'm sorry I did this.

3223
04:16:39,150 --> 04:16:41,350
And I was like, bro, I've been queuing for so long.

3224
04:16:41,910 --> 04:16:44,110
I don't remember.

3225
04:16:53,100 --> 04:16:56,020
I've already lost track of everybody I've bumped into.

3226
04:17:03,960 --> 04:17:04,440

04:17:04,460 --> 04:17:24,320

04:17:36,940 --> 04:17:38,620
That was his team in there.

3231
04:17:38,800 --> 04:17:40,460
That was his fucking team in that.

3232
04:17:40,540 --> 04:17:41,020
Oh, God.

3233
04:17:41,320 --> 04:17:41,340
Okay.

3234
04:17:42,240 --> 04:17:43,120

04:17:43,120 --> 04:17:43,620
Oh, my God.

3236
04:17:43,880 --> 04:17:45,740
Bumped into their fucking entire team.

3237
04:17:46,400 --> 04:17:49,300
I don't even know where to land and get loot now.

3238
04:17:52,440 --> 04:17:55,560
The fact that that was their entire team there, too.

3239
04:17:55,760 --> 04:17:56,580
That's crazy.

3240
04:17:57,800 --> 04:17:58,360
Oh, my God.

3241
04:17:58,400 --> 04:17:59,420
It's not the nemesis.

are a team of two now like a enemy of idea He's above us.

3245
04:18:51,140 --> 04:18:53,420
In case he fucking drops down into my...

3246
04:18:54,420 --> 04:18:55,100
Really?

3247
04:18:57,620 --> 04:18:59,300
Oh my god.

3248
04:19:09,520 --> 04:19:09,820
Oh

3249
04:19:13,870 --> 04:19:14,350
my god.

3250
04:19:16,950 --> 04:19:19,710
There's too many people surrounding me in this hell.

3251
04:19:26,020 --> 04:19:27,280
Oh, he's one!

3252
04:19:27,680 --> 04:19:29,680
He just never stopped left clicking!

3253
04:19:30,680 --> 04:19:32,020
He just never...

3254
04:19:32,040 --> 04:19:33,500
Stop left-clicking!

3255
04:19:36,380 --> 04:19:37,800
Yeah, I hope you die from that.

3256
04:19:41,780 --> 04:19:44,100
Okay, I don't want to be in this town.

3257
04:19:44,300 --> 04:19:45,920
I don't want to be in this town anymore.

3258
04:19:49,800 --> 04:19:52,140
This town is fucking hell.

3259
04:19:53,480 --> 04:19:55,040
Or even is my team.

3260
04:19:57,000 --> 04:19:58,560
This town is not worth it.

3261
04:20:01,100 --> 04:20:02,020
Like, I'm sorry.

3262
04:20:02,040 --> 04:20:03,000
All right, buddy, good.

3263
04:20:03,000 --> 04:20:04,940
But, like, it's not worth being here.

3264
04:20:12,080 --> 04:20:13,120
I don't know.

3265
04:20:13,300 --> 04:20:15,040
Man, oh my god, round five.

3266
04:20:25,500 --> 04:20:29,260
I think the hardest part about this is just the amount of
third parties, you know?

3267
04:20:30,960 --> 04:20:33,480
It's just like they could be anywhere.

3268
04:20:34,020 --> 04:20:36,060
They could be right behind me right now.

3269
04:20:40,040 --> 04:20:42,120
like oh my like right now

3270
04:20:45,780 --> 04:20:47,280
oh my god

3271
04:20:50,760 --> 04:20:58,240
oh my god okay I knew he was gonna do it see like that's the
thing they could land right behind me that's the hardest

3272
04:20:58,240 --> 04:21:08,340
part about this game mode they could like land right behind
me and I can't fucking like counter it Oh my god.

3273
04:21:13,120 --> 04:21:13,700
It's okay.

3274
04:21:14,260 --> 04:21:16,340
We're still, technically we're still in it.

3275
04:21:17,380 --> 04:21:18,080
Ninja's everywhere.

3276
04:21:18,940 --> 04:21:21,700
He's right behind me, isn't he?

3277
04:21:26,120 --> 04:21:29,500
Yeah, but this is like beyond regular third party.

3278
04:21:31,100 --> 04:21:32,340
This is a...

3279
04:21:33,120 --> 04:21:35,460
This third party extreme.

3280
04:21:36,680 --> 04:21:37,300
Like, right!

3281
04:21:37,340 --> 04:21:40,400
here okay

3282
04:21:53,390 --> 04:22:03,320
it could be right behind me couldn't how is there

3283
04:22:10,050 --> 04:22:20,630
oh my god he's right behind me isn't it he's right behind me
isn't he

3284
04:22:27,860 --> 04:22:28,980
Oh my god, what he is.

3285
04:22:36,660 --> 04:22:37,940
He's right here.

3286
04:22:42,090 --> 04:22:43,570
I fucking get so I knew it.

3287
04:22:43,650 --> 04:22:44,510
I fucking knew it.

3288
04:22:44,670 --> 04:22:45,910
I was like, he's right behind me.

3289
04:22:46,190 --> 04:22:46,990
He's right behind.

3290
04:22:47,310 --> 04:22:49,290
They always just land on me.

3291
04:22:53,130 --> 04:22:54,870
I could hear it, too.

3292
04:22:55,330 --> 04:22:59,030
I literally hear the fucking landing sound.

3293
04:23:00,150 --> 04:23:01,650
How about 50 more?

3294
04:23:01,950 --> 04:23:03,890
There's like a third party the game.

3295
04:23:04,430 --> 04:23:05,470
It's so chaotic.

3296
04:23:05,590 --> 04:23:06,110
I don't know.

3297
04:23:06,450 --> 04:23:08,820
His way is so much.

3298
04:23:18,100 --> 04:23:20,150
He's right there, isn't he?

3299
04:23:20,610 --> 04:23:20,610
Again.

3300
04:23:21,770 --> 04:23:22,630
I hear him.

3301
04:23:22,910 --> 04:23:23,870
I hear him.

3302
04:23:25,130 --> 04:23:26,450
I fucking hear him.

3303
04:23:28,030 --> 04:23:29,530
I hear him.

3304
04:23:34,980 --> 04:23:38,150
I literally hear them fucking running at us.

3305
04:23:39,170 --> 04:23:42,170
I hear the sound of bodies flying in.

3306
04:23:44,430 --> 04:23:45,010
He's right.

3307
04:23:45,170 --> 04:23:45,650
They're right.

3308
04:23:49,930 --> 04:23:51,530
Oh my god, our guy is so brave.

3309
04:23:54,410 --> 04:23:56,110
He's fucking crazy for that.

3310
04:23:58,330 --> 04:24:00,410
He's fucking crazy for landing behind him.

3311
04:24:00,630 --> 04:24:02,670
Like, holy shit, I don't know what the plan was.

3312
04:24:04,870 --> 04:24:05,930
I don't know if that was it.

3313
04:24:10,110 --> 04:24:11,630
That's not coming towards me, right?

3314
04:24:26,850 --> 04:24:33,730
oh my god i don't know where it is oh my god and then
there's a zone

3315
04:24:39,220 --> 04:24:41,140
there's someone to my left

3316
04:24:47,460 --> 04:24:49,520
he's right there isn't he

3317
04:24:53,240 --> 04:24:56,340

3318
04:25:00,400 --> 04:25:08,160
wait that guy's bot that's a bot that's a bot right there
Another bot is right here.

3319
04:25:19,190 --> 04:25:19,970
Another squad?

3320
04:25:20,950 --> 04:25:29,510
Oh my god.

3321
04:25:30,450 --> 04:25:30,690
Okay.

3322
04:25:46,370 --> 04:25:46,750
Not.

3323
04:25:49,450 --> 04:25:51,350
There's like a little fence there.

3324
04:25:51,590 --> 04:25:53,850
I think it's doing it.

3325
04:25:54,630 --> 04:25:56,250
I can't get it further up.

3326
04:25:59,790 --> 04:26:02,070
It's the best I can do.

3327
04:26:02,470 --> 04:26:03,270
It really is.

3328
04:26:16,640 --> 04:26:18,580
Which one's a real Mirage?

3329
04:26:18,720 --> 04:26:19,620
Is Mirage good?

3330
04:26:25,750 --> 04:26:26,170
Others?

3331
04:26:26,570 --> 04:26:27,570
Which one?

3332
04:26:33,590 --> 04:26:37,490
Oh my god, another squad.

3333
04:26:38,390 --> 04:26:40,350

3337
04:27:25,490 --> 04:27:26,350
That's the trap.

3338
04:27:27,090 --> 04:27:28,550
Just live for the team.

3339
04:27:29,050 --> 04:27:35,730

04:28:37,380 --> 04:28:43,880
Oh shit I didn't think he was gonna find me Not gonna lie I
can't believe he found me there.

3345
04:28:44,620 --> 04:28:44,620
Really?

3346
04:28:44,860 --> 04:28:47,060
How do they know exactly where I am?

3347
04:28:47,240 --> 04:28:47,900
It's crazy.

3348
04:28:48,800 --> 04:28:49,640
They knew...

3349
04:28:49,640 --> 04:28:51,680
They always know exactly where I'm gonna be.

3350
04:28:53,680 --> 04:28:56,220
30 seconds to this match gets a whole lot smaller.

3351
04:29:02,760 --> 04:29:04,280
Yeah, but they knew I was gonna be in that hole.

3352
04:29:04,640 --> 04:29:05,000
Oh, my God.

3353
04:29:05,120 --> 04:29:05,560
You're crazy!

3354
04:29:05,740 --> 04:29:06,160
No!

3355
04:29:06,380 --> 04:29:07,920
You just had to live!

3356
04:29:12,060 --> 04:29:13,480
You just had to...

3357
04:29:13,480 --> 04:29:13,800
Oh, wait.

3358
04:29:13,860 --> 04:29:14,380
Was that the...

3359
04:29:14,400 --> 04:29:15,460
Were we the last team?

3360
04:29:15,620 --> 04:29:17,440
I thought it was top two, three more.

3361
04:29:20,020 --> 04:29:21,300
They knew I was in the hole.

3362
04:29:21,660 --> 04:29:23,580
They always knew I was in the hole.

3363
04:29:27,140 --> 04:29:28,740
He had to wait three.

3364
04:29:29,040 --> 04:29:33,480
To be fair, to be fair, like they were always like running
away, too.

3365
04:29:35,380 --> 04:29:35,920
You know what?

3366
04:29:37,200 --> 04:29:38,540
I did my part.

3367
04:29:40,240 --> 04:29:40,960
But I'm fucking playing.

3368
04:29:40,980 --> 04:29:42,800
I feel like Mirage has to be it.

3369
04:29:44,400 --> 04:29:55,880
like i feel like in this game mode everyone just rips off

04:42:16,180 --> 04:42:18,180
I stop believing.

3541
04:42:19,800 --> 04:42:20,560
Oh my god.

3542
04:42:20,680 --> 04:42:21,980
I believe he has an R&I.

3543
04:42:23,040 --> 04:42:23,460
Okay.

3544
04:42:23,820 --> 04:42:23,960
Okay.

3545
04:42:24,020 --> 04:42:25,400
If you rest me, I won't.

3546
04:42:26,080 --> 04:42:28,620
If you rest me, I won't take the penalty.

3547
04:42:29,140 --> 04:42:29,620
Yeah!

3548
04:42:30,240 --> 04:42:30,800
Yeah!

3549
04:42:36,080 --> 04:42:37,860
Oh my god, that scared me.

3550
04:42:40,240 --> 04:42:43,400
The actual, I believed in the power of the R9.

3551
04:42:44,140 --> 04:42:45,600
I knew he had the R9.

3552
04:42:45,860 --> 04:42:46,860
I knew he was set for life.

3553
04:42:48,460 --> 04:42:49,320
I knew he could do it.

3554
04:42:51,420 --> 04:42:52,900
Oh my god, enemy's spawning nearby.

3555
04:42:53,400 --> 04:42:55,440
Oh my god, they're right behind me, aren't they?

3556
04:42:56,940 --> 04:42:58,680
Oh my god, they're right behind.

3557
04:42:59,000 --> 04:43:01,580
Oh my god, how fucking course they are!

3558
04:43:02,280 --> 04:43:04,280

3559
04:43:07,840 --> 04:43:10,280
Like I'm not allowed to breathe!

3560
04:43:27,250 --> 04:43:28,650
Holy fuck!

3561
04:43:28,790 --> 04:43:30,930

3562
04:43:39,270 --> 04:43:40,990
Breathing... Oh my god!

3563
04:43:41,090 --> 04:43:41,650

Guys, I know it's wild, but what if they stop?

3571
04:44:44,990 --> 04:44:45,630
Oh, but...

3572
04:44:52,750 --> 04:44:55,930
I was going to say, surely they'll stop coming, right?

3573
04:44:59,390 --> 04:45:00,830
I'll take it.

3574
04:45:01,010 --> 04:45:02,930
I'll take it at the moment I peek.

They don't stop coming.

3592
04:45:58,630 --> 04:46:01,910
I can't even breathe for one second.

3593
04:46:02,290 --> 04:46:06,550

I was gone for one second.

3638
04:52:05,060 --> 04:52:06,320
That's all they needed.

3639
04:52:06,760 --> 04:52:08,560
The one second difference.

3640
04:52:10,060 --> 04:52:11,120

3641
04:52:11,380 --> 04:52:13,120

3657
04:53:13,190 --> 04:53:14,010
The girl with shields?

3658
04:53:14,150 --> 04:53:15,090
Oh my god, it's been so long.

3659
04:53:17,430 --> 04:53:19,310
It's been so fucking long.

3660
04:53:27,830 --> 04:53:28,210
Mirage?

3661
04:53:28,450 --> 04:53:29,670

3662
04:53:29,990 --> 04:53:31,010

Alright.

3669
04:53:45,560 --> 04:53:46,820
It's never gonna stop.

3670
04:53:47,340 --> 04:53:49,680
If we die in four minutes, we could still queue up another
one.

3671
04:53:52,620 --> 04:53:52,720
Connoit?

3672
04:53:52,880 --> 04:53:53,540
Yeah, Connoit.

3673
04:53:54,540 --> 04:53:56,540
Oh my god, I hate this area so much.

3674
04:53:56,600 --> 04:53:58,120
Surely no one's gonna land here, right?

3675
04:53:59,220 --> 04:54:00,100
Fucking hell.

3676
04:54:01,440 --> 04:54:02,580
Someone did land here.

3677
04:54:02,900 --> 04:54:03,780
I might not get a gun.

3678
04:54:06,440 --> 04:54:08,060
Guys, I messed up.

3679
04:54:08,420 --> 04:54:09,460
Oh, my God.

3680
04:54:12,920 --> 04:54:14,420
I didn't get a gun.

3681
04:54:18,880 --> 04:54:20,000
Surely, like...

3682
04:54:20,000 --> 04:54:21,320
I didn't have a single gun.

3683
04:54:25,020 --> 04:54:25,840
It's okay.

3684
04:54:27,480 --> 04:54:28,440
I got a shield, though.

3685
04:54:29,080 --> 04:54:29,440

He's gonna start.

He's gonna land behind me, isn't he?

3703
04:56:04,150 --> 04:56:06,010
He's gonna land behind me.

3704
04:56:06,070 --> 04:56:06,790
I can feel it.

3705
04:56:07,090 --> 04:56:09,010

04:56:35,550 --> 04:56:36,150
I'm leaving.

3714
04:56:36,370 --> 04:56:37,070
I can't.

3715
04:56:37,350 --> 04:56:38,890
I hate this area.

3716
04:56:39,410 --> 04:56:41,810
I really hate this one area.

3717
04:56:46,430 --> 04:56:49,130
I fucking hate this zone.

3718
04:56:51,370 --> 04:56:55,270
If it was anywhere else to land on.

04:56:55,530 --> 04:56:56,230
Oh my god.

3720
04:56:57,050 --> 04:57:00,510
I wish I could just fucking stop and kill my other game.

3721
04:57:04,250 --> 04:57:05,510
There we go.

3722
04:57:06,350 --> 04:57:08,370
This area fucking sucks.

3723
04:57:12,070 --> 04:57:14,170

04:58:08,160 --> 04:58:09,700
There's nowhere to go.

3731
04:58:10,360 --> 04:58:11,860
There's nowhere to go.

3732
04:58:12,640 --> 04:58:14,540
I'm flying straight to point.

3733
04:58:15,700 --> 04:58:17,340

3734
04:58:18,740 --> 04:58:19,620

3735
04:58:20,040 --> 04:58:20,940
No, I have to do extra work.

3736
04:58:21,340 --> 04:58:22,020

Oh, fuck this.

3739
04:58:31,620 --> 04:58:32,700
Another spot.

3740
04:58:32,720 --> 04:58:33,240
Where?

3741
04:58:36,300 --> 04:58:36,820

Oh my god.

3744
04:58:53,420 --> 04:58:54,680
I can't get over there in time.

3745
04:58:54,960 --> 04:58:55,480
It doesn't matter.

3746
04:58:57,480 --> 04:58:59,080
I was way too far gone.

3747
04:58:59,720 --> 04:59:00,500
It doesn't matter.

3748
04:59:00,620 --> 04:59:01,760
I was way too far gone.

3749
04:59:01,980 --> 04:59:03,740
It's too late for me to queue another game too.

3750
04:59:03,860 --> 04:59:04,320
It's seven.

3751
04:59:04,800 --> 04:59:05,900
It's fucking seven.

3752
04:59:09,240 --> 04:59:10,520
Jesus Christ.

3753
04:59:11,200 --> 04:59:12,060
That's way too late.

3754
04:59:14,360 --> 04:59:16,000
I'm going the other way.

3755
04:59:16,460 --> 04:59:16,960

04:59:28,300 --> 04:59:30,700
I threw these out 20 years ago.

3761
04:59:32,980 --> 04:59:34,800

You can have that.

3778
05:02:00,990 --> 05:02:04,250
You can have that area.

3779
05:02:04,250 --> 05:02:07,150

3780
05:02:10,450 --> 05:02:12,050

Wait.

3787
05:02:56,020 --> 05:02:57,740
Shirley didn't close at exactly 7.

3788
05:02:58,120 --> 05:02:59,140
I can't sell first.

3789
05:02:59,220 --> 05:03:02,120
There was a guy right there and the other guy was in the
lobby.

3790
05:03:05,320 --> 05:03:05,860
Shirley.

3791
05:03:06,560 --> 05:03:08,940
Shirley, I could get another Q in.

3792
05:03:09,380 --> 05:03:09,760
Shirley.

3793
05:03:11,120 --> 05:03:12,860
I just didn't want to be there.

3794
05:03:12,980 --> 05:03:14,180
I was so checked out.

3795
05:03:14,500 --> 05:03:22,480
I swear, we landed there like 20, like, The last four games,
we landed right there.

3796
05:03:22,620 --> 05:03:24,100
And I was so checked out.

3797
05:03:24,220 --> 05:03:27,660
I was like, I hated that place so much.

3798
05:03:28,440 --> 05:03:31,220
That place fucking sucked.

3799
05:03:31,620 --> 05:03:32,660
I hated it.

3800
05:03:33,360 --> 05:03:36,200
I was so close to just leaving that game.

3801
05:03:36,980 --> 05:03:41,780
I was so close to leaving.

3802
05:03:48,840 --> 05:04:01,200
yeah because i couldn't find a gun that area sucks why does
anyone land there you get barely any loot there there and

3803
05:04:01,200 --> 05:04:05,680
like it's just hell it's literally hell

3804
05:04:10,520 --> 05:04:20,740
it's actually it's actually hell on earth that one area i
was happy with i swear to god was more crazy like even skull

3805
05:04:20,740 --> 05:04:29,860
town was better than that area i will say because skull town
there was more distribution of players around the town but

3806
05:04:29,860 --> 05:04:38,980
like everyone was just congested in that one area and you
can and it was like where do we go it's a mosh pit it's

3807
05:04:38,980 --> 05:04:46,240
literally a mosh pit of doom at least skull yeah skull town
has more town

3808
05:04:52,720 --> 05:05:01,460
okay now i'm sort of okay with the re45 i made it work i
made the r the re45 work

3809
05:05:22,220 --> 05:05:39,410

3810
05:05:43,170 --> 05:05:45,070
It's not fair.

3811
05:05:46,430 --> 05:05:47,870
They put me in hell.

3812
05:05:48,070 --> 05:05:49,790
I didn't want to play that lobby.

3813
05:05:56,740 --> 05:05:58,360
I had to fight in hell.

3814
05:06:01,180 --> 05:06:06,220
I was this close to leaving when they took me back there.

3815
05:06:11,400 --> 05:06:13,020
I was this close.

3816
05:06:14,900 --> 05:06:16,480
I wanted to leave.

3817
05:06:19,800 --> 05:06:20,400
No!

3818
05:06:21,020 --> 05:06:23,060
They closed the server!

3819
05:06:34,260 --> 05:06:35,200
Oh my god.

3820
05:06:36,340 --> 05:06:36,980
That's fine.

3821
05:06:37,460 --> 05:06:38,860
There's still... It's possible.

3822
05:06:39,080 --> 05:06:40,400
People just gotta believe.

3823
05:06:41,240 --> 05:06:43,420
We just need more people to believe.

3824
05:06:45,300 --> 05:06:46,920
Oh, wait, like...

3825
05:06:46,920 --> 05:06:48,020
Oh my god.

3826
05:06:48,160 --> 05:06:48,840
No, they're leaving.

3827
05:06:48,980 --> 05:06:50,020
Why are you all leaving?

3828
05:06:50,760 --> 05:06:52,140
I don't understand.

3829
05:06:53,700 --> 05:06:55,260
Why are you all leaving?

3830
05:06:59,040 --> 05:07:00,080
Don't leave.

3831
05:07:02,940 --> 05:07:03,980
Don't leave.

3832
05:07:05,620 --> 05:07:08,400
Party's just about to get started, guys.

3833
05:07:08,680 --> 05:07:10,320
I'm in my second win.

3834
05:07:12,220 --> 05:07:13,540
They don't, the time they go.

3835
05:07:13,820 --> 05:07:15,520
Honestly, I will actually go back to regular.

3836
05:07:15,900 --> 05:07:17,680
I need that one win.

3837
05:07:19,080 --> 05:07:22,280
I felt like I got cucked so hard in my games.

3838
05:07:22,440 --> 05:07:25,460
Literally, like, every time I get close to winning, my
teammates leave me.

3839
05:07:26,980 --> 05:07:28,700
like games where i fucking carry

3840
05:07:42,160 --> 05:07:59,380
all right that's it i know what to do it's top wait seven
players regular would be better because like um i don't get

3841
05:07:59,380 --> 05:08:07,980
like uh because like it's more there's more like players of
different skill level for here it was literally like and the

3842
05:08:07,980 --> 05:08:15,980
fact that like all the players and the big content creators
were three stacking too but like but all the pros and the

3843
05:08:15,980 --> 05:08:19,880
content creators they're not gonna be playing pubs that's
the thing they're not gonna be playing pubs they're just

3844
05:08:19,880 --> 05:08:30,690
gonna be playing cooking rink yeah like i was like one of
the few people that wasn't three stacking or dual queued all

3845
05:08:30,690 --> 05:08:38,410
right it's time it's fucking time because the only people
who have access to early access are just content creators

3846
05:08:38,410 --> 05:08:45,650
and pro players that was i was having that's why like i was
getting like the fucking never stopped after seven years

3847
05:08:45,650 --> 05:08:54,330
they're stronger than me they really are because it's like
you know you know sometimes you need variety in your life

3848
05:08:54,330 --> 05:09:04,770
but these guys they're like inject apex into my fucking
veins and you're like injected into my veins we're never

3849
05:09:04,770 --> 05:09:07,130
leaving and they're stronger than me

3850
05:09:17,090 --> 05:09:29,970
all right it's time this time okay we're not playing watson
i don't have my skin there i don't remember what i was

3851
05:09:29,970 --> 05:09:38,430

3856
05:10:26,180 --> 05:10:32,200
Alright Let's see solo queue warrior experience.

3857
05:10:34,680 --> 05:10:35,560
Not me.

3858
05:10:35,680 --> 05:10:37,300
I literally won my last game.

3859
05:10:38,580 --> 05:10:39,680
While I was warming up.

3860
05:10:43,920 --> 05:10:44,460
Alright, here we go.

3861
05:10:48,280 --> 05:10:49,180
Alright, here we go.

3862
05:10:49,580 --> 05:10:50,360
I'm the jump master.

3863
05:10:51,040 --> 05:10:51,680
This time.

3864
05:10:54,460 --> 05:10:55,600
Where are we gonna go?

3865
05:10:56,160 --> 05:10:57,000
Oh my gosh, this map.

3866
05:10:57,060 --> 05:10:58,640
I have not seen this map at all.

3867
05:10:58,940 --> 05:11:01,240
For the entire time in the early access.

3868
05:11:01,400 --> 05:11:02,360
It was out of rotation.

3869
05:11:06,350 --> 05:11:08,050
Why are we going?

3870
05:11:09,430 --> 05:11:10,410
People are already dead.

3871
05:11:13,810 --> 05:11:16,910
Okay, it's either he's lagging or I'm like, okay, it's him.

3872
05:11:17,370 --> 05:11:17,810
It's him.

3873
05:11:21,550 --> 05:11:23,410
It's like, oh.

3874
05:11:25,170 --> 05:11:26,190
It's this guy.

3875
05:11:26,290 --> 05:11:26,970
It's not me.

3876
05:11:27,250 --> 05:11:28,430
It's actually this guy.

3877
05:11:28,650 --> 05:11:29,830
This guy was not it.

3878
05:11:34,650 --> 05:11:37,230
And this guy was not having it.

3879
05:11:42,140 --> 05:11:43,120
Alright, let's see it.

3880
05:11:48,450 --> 05:11:49,330
I don't know.

3881
05:11:49,450 --> 05:11:52,770
Like, I'm like, I'm like a love-hate relationship right now
with this R.

3882
05:11:52,770 --> 05:11:53,830
I think, like, the R.E.

3883
05:11:53,830 --> 05:11:55,210
was really good at certain moments.

3884
05:11:57,790 --> 05:12:05,690
There were so many close games where, like, if my team
didn't leave me to die, or after I sacrificed myself for

3885
05:12:05,690 --> 05:12:07,390
them, that could have won.

3886
05:12:09,130 --> 05:12:10,350
There's so many.

3887
05:12:11,090 --> 05:12:13,710
i was like team please

3888
05:12:20,540 --> 05:12:33,800
i just need my r9 no i'm okay this guy was laggy as hell all
i find were like energy guns jesus that's all there is

3889
05:12:33,800 --> 05:12:41,300
weapon enhanced nothing a bit of elbow crease i think i can
get back into my like i i will say i'm like super rusty and

3890
05:12:41,300 --> 05:12:50,560
depending on what gun i'm using like pk i will say I'm super
rusty only because like there's not really guns that there's

3891
05:12:50,560 --> 05:13:03,520
not really like shotgun characters in like hero shooters in
general especially in support but like oh no no I feel like

3892
05:13:03,520 --> 05:13:12,620
if I just play this regularly I just get back into it I mean
I've been I was hitting my R9 shots I was hitting my R9

3893
05:13:12,620 --> 05:13:16,040
tracking shots Because that's my shit.

3894
05:13:17,100 --> 05:13:18,380
That's my gun.

3895
05:13:26,890 --> 05:13:28,850
I feel like I was holding my own.

3896
05:13:29,090 --> 05:13:31,550
Despite having played it for so long.

3897
05:13:32,010 --> 05:13:32,910
Yeah, was that?

3898
05:13:33,530 --> 05:13:37,010
I mean, I did whip shotgun shots, but it's only shotgun
though.

3899
05:13:37,330 --> 05:13:38,510
It was only shotgun.

3900
05:13:42,110 --> 05:13:46,050
Alright, but the last half of the game with Wingman, I hit
everything.

3901
05:13:46,950 --> 05:13:49,790
I hit everything during the last half of that match.

3902
05:13:50,330 --> 05:13:52,270
Literally clutch that fight for my team.

3903
05:13:58,550 --> 05:13:59,990
I can still beam.

3904
05:14:00,290 --> 05:14:00,850
That's right.

3905
05:14:10,030 --> 05:14:10,770
Oh, nice.

3906
05:14:11,770 --> 05:14:12,670
Increase max number.

3907
05:14:12,810 --> 05:14:13,830
I would go with that.

3908
05:14:14,950 --> 05:14:16,250
I still need that.

3909
05:14:16,950 --> 05:14:17,310
Oh, there you go.

3910
05:14:17,410 --> 05:14:18,070
There's a carbine.

3911
05:14:18,930 --> 05:14:20,210
I'll take that actually.

3912
05:14:25,770 --> 05:14:26,870
I need my R9.

3913
05:14:28,090 --> 05:14:29,510
Where's my R9?

3914
05:14:31,830 --> 05:14:35,090
Oh, holy shit, it goes all the way.

3915
05:14:35,150 --> 05:14:36,230
I don't remember that.

3916
05:14:37,030 --> 05:14:38,410
Well, nobody's here, though.

3917
05:14:38,770 --> 05:14:41,590
Oh, well, they know we're here now.

3918
05:14:49,780 --> 05:14:50,500
What the?

3919
05:14:51,340 --> 05:14:52,180
Oh, shit.

3920
05:14:56,080 --> 05:14:56,580
Stupid.

3921
05:15:05,080 --> 05:15:06,020
They're like right here.

3922
05:15:06,940 --> 05:15:08,180
I'll give them a pierce.

3923
05:15:08,300 --> 05:15:12,240
Oh my god, there's Sayonara, I guess.

3924
05:15:14,620 --> 05:15:16,380
Fuck his team.

3925
05:15:17,880 --> 05:15:19,260
It's Sayonara.

3926
05:15:19,440 --> 05:15:21,060
We'll fucking Resio later.

3927
05:15:21,460 --> 05:15:22,520
I guess.

3928
05:15:24,460 --> 05:15:25,640
That's crazy.

3929
05:15:25,780 --> 05:15:27,360
They literally left that poor man.

3930
05:15:28,740 --> 05:15:29,760
They're like, we'll craft you.

3931
05:15:30,500 --> 05:15:31,720
We'll remember you.

3932
05:15:31,840 --> 05:15:32,760
We'll craft you later.

3933
05:15:36,610 --> 05:15:37,290
That way?

3934
05:15:39,770 --> 05:15:40,050
Oh.

3935
05:15:41,750 --> 05:15:42,310
How long?

3936
05:15:44,490 --> 05:15:45,530
I still have time.

3937
05:15:46,750 --> 05:15:48,770
Well, I hope I can still...

3938
05:15:49,350 --> 05:15:49,650
Alright.

3939
05:15:57,710 --> 05:15:59,470
I don't think he saw me.

3940
05:16:03,760 --> 05:16:04,220
Oh, no.

3941
05:16:04,400 --> 05:16:04,880
He definitely...

3942
05:16:07,140 --> 05:16:08,080
One HP.

3943
05:16:09,260 --> 05:16:10,340
Actually, one HP.

3944
05:16:11,400 --> 05:16:12,340
I'm so sad.

3945
05:16:13,440 --> 05:16:14,040
He's...

3946
05:16:14,040 --> 05:16:14,680
He's solo.

3947
05:16:16,880 --> 05:16:17,860
Oh, my God.

3948
05:16:17,880 --> 05:16:19,540
That guy is so low!

3949
05:16:20,620 --> 05:16:21,340
He's gone.

3950
05:16:22,180 --> 05:16:23,680
That guy is gone, gone.

3951
05:16:24,540 --> 05:16:25,900
He ain't coming back.

3952
05:16:27,260 --> 05:16:27,980
Wait, what?

3953
05:16:32,220 --> 05:16:33,500
You're so dumb.

3954
05:16:34,700 --> 05:16:35,560
Holy shit.

3955
05:16:40,050 --> 05:16:41,430
You're so dumb.

3956
05:16:42,910 --> 05:16:45,090
He fucking moved.

3957
05:16:46,250 --> 05:16:50,090
If he didn't move, he'll be fine.

3958
05:16:50,290 --> 05:16:51,470
He literally moved.

3959
05:16:52,050 --> 05:16:58,890

They would be so dead if I had an R9.

3968
05:18:48,070 --> 05:18:48,930

I actually don't know why he crawled that way.

3991
05:21:53,610 --> 05:21:59,110
He could have crawled my side, but he was very insistent on

Who's the real Mirage?

4033
05:25:24,960 --> 05:25:27,120

Whoops.

4035
05:25:31,120 --> 05:25:32,300
I thought I was...

4036
05:25:32,300 --> 05:25:34,260
For some reason, I thought I was something else.

4037
05:25:35,260 --> 05:25:35,920
How do I...

4038
05:25:35,920 --> 05:25:36,140
Boom.

05:25:42,050 --> 05:25:42,530
Alright.

Increase alteration.

4042
05:25:45,350 --> 05:25:46,070
Double the number.

4043
05:25:46,070 --> 05:25:47,490
I feel like alteration, right?

4044
05:25:47,490 --> 05:25:48,290
It would be the best.

4045
05:25:50,790 --> 05:25:51,470
Yeah, I know.

Oh my god, I keep thinking I'm something else.

05:25:58,150 --> 05:25:58,770
That was my bad.

4051
05:25:58,850 --> 05:26:00,190
I keep thinking I'm a different character.

4052
05:26:15,820 --> 05:26:17,920
Let's hope there's someone else here.

4053
05:26:20,280 --> 05:26:21,320
Alright, there we go.

4054
05:26:23,220 --> 05:26:26,140
Yeah, I keep thinking I'm smoking because I don't play it.

4055
05:26:26,440 --> 05:26:28,480
I don't play Ballistic that much.

4056
05:26:28,840 --> 05:26:36,960
So I feel like I'm doing a smoke grenade or or, like, Mirage
Q, because I was telling Mirage in that crazy-ass game mode.

4057
05:26:37,800 --> 05:26:39,000
I hated that game mode.

4058
05:26:39,720 --> 05:26:40,380
I still!

4059
05:26:41,580 --> 05:26:43,260
Okay, that was a sick shot.

4060
05:26:43,920 --> 05:26:46,900
You have to admit, that shot was sick as hell.

4061
05:26:52,420 --> 05:26:52,900
Alright.

4062
05:26:59,140 --> 05:27:00,220
Alright, here we go.

4063
05:27:03,320 --> 05:27:04,020
Where did he go?

4064
05:27:06,180 --> 05:27:08,320
Oh my He actually shot back.

4065
05:27:09,780 --> 05:27:11,580
I did not think he would shoot back, bro.

4066
05:27:11,800 --> 05:27:12,500
Get out of here.

4067
05:27:13,560 --> 05:27:14,600
Execution style.

4068
05:27:16,600 --> 05:27:17,580
That's right.

4069
05:27:20,000 --> 05:27:21,220
Get out of here.

4070
05:27:25,400 --> 05:27:26,620
Oh my god, he's controller.

4071
05:27:26,760 --> 05:27:27,900
That makes a lot of sense.

4072
05:27:30,260 --> 05:27:31,880
He has a teammate, though.

4073
05:27:32,620 --> 05:27:36,260
Like, I had to do a finisher, so...

4074
05:27:36,900 --> 05:27:52,720
friends wherever he is hmm where did your homie go I had to
finish him so you did have friends must be nice must be so

4075
05:27:52,720 --> 05:28:07,660

all right it's not like I went through solo queue hell

4076
05:28:07,660 --> 05:28:08,540

4077
05:28:09,000 --> 05:28:09,100
Nope.

4078
05:28:13,840 --> 05:28:14,480
You know what?

4079
05:28:14,760 --> 05:28:18,220
I'm gonna be solo queue tomorrow and tomorrow as well.

4080
05:28:20,000 --> 05:28:21,000
For Overwatch.

4081
05:28:26,670 --> 05:28:27,010
Alright.

4082
05:28:31,200 --> 05:28:31,780
Exactly.

4083
05:28:32,040 --> 05:28:32,400
Exactly.

4084
05:28:32,560 --> 05:28:35,720
Who needs friends when we got sick ass skin?

4085
05:28:36,500 --> 05:28:37,140
Exactly.

4086
05:28:37,840 --> 05:28:38,340
Holy shit.

4087
05:28:38,380 --> 05:28:39,420
This guy's far far.

4088
05:28:41,100 --> 05:28:42,600
Yeah, you guys don't remember?

4089
05:28:42,900 --> 05:28:45,060
Five characters are in shadow dropping tomorrow.

4090
05:28:45,800 --> 05:28:46,960
But I won't play Jetpack Cat.

4091
05:28:47,040 --> 05:28:48,700
I'm so looking forward to Jetpack Cat.

4092
05:28:49,720 --> 05:28:50,720
Of course I am.

4093
05:28:50,960 --> 05:28:51,600

4094
05:28:56,700 --> 05:28:57,660

05:29:03,890 --> 05:29:06,070
Or a little bit faster, though, at least.

4097
05:29:09,690 --> 05:29:10,650
Another squad?

4098
05:29:12,670 --> 05:29:14,230
This is not good for us.

4099
05:29:20,960 --> 05:29:29,220

4161
05:35:22,840 --> 05:35:25,120

But, thank you all for coming, guys.

4163
05:35:29,240 --> 05:35:31,240
I really, really appreciate it.

05:35:31,420 --> 05:35:32,580
I hope you guys are excited.

4165
05:35:33,760 --> 05:35:41,240
I hope you guys are as excited for the skin as I am, chat.

4166
05:35:41,460 --> 05:35:42,720
I can't believe...

4167
05:35:42,720 --> 05:35:43,680
I can't believe...

4168
05:35:43,680 --> 05:35:44,720
I can't believe it's real.

4169
05:35:48,320 --> 05:35:50,840
I can't believe it's real, guys, that...

4170
05:35:52,840 --> 05:36:00,220
actually in apex legends oh my god i honestly never thought
this would ever become a reality in like i thought i was

4171
05:36:00,220 --> 05:36:05,760
like you know past my prime past my apex prime you know

4172
05:36:08,800 --> 05:36:16,360
but i really appreciate that the apex devs reached out to me
and picked me to be part of the seven year anniversary event

4173
05:36:16,360 --> 05:36:24,200
and um being able to be part of history being the very first
to be in the game.

4174
05:36:24,620 --> 05:36:26,940
It really is fucking crazy to see.

4175
05:36:29,680 --> 05:36:34,800
And being able to have, being able to choose Watson as the
skin to represent me.

4176
05:36:35,440 --> 05:36:44,620
Because I have a lot of memories involved and how I got
started and how I reached top 500 before when the top 500

4177
05:36:44,620 --> 05:36:46,640
was just 500 people and not 750.

4178
05:36:51,500 --> 05:36:59,120
But thank you guys i hope tomorrow tomorrow you'd be

And then Sunday is the PUBG tournament and also Monday.

4194
05:38:38,900 --> 05:38:46,120
Also, unfortunate news, Kony had to drop out because he
accidentally double scheduled for it because he already

4195
05:38:46,120 --> 05:38:47,920
scheduled something else on Saturday.

4196
05:38:48,460 --> 05:38:49,560
So I'm sorry, on Sunday.

4197
05:38:49,840 --> 05:38:51,280
So unfortunately, Kony had to drop out.

4198
05:38:51,300 --> 05:38:53,040
I have no idea who the replacement yet.

4199
05:38:53,780 --> 05:38:56,920
I'm still trying to find a replacement.

4200
05:38:58,420 --> 05:39:01,840
So I have to figure that out today.

4201
05:39:05,320 --> 05:39:07,320
But yeah, thank you all for coming, guys.

4202
05:39:08,080 --> 05:39:10,640
It's been a while since I played Apex.

4203
05:39:10,940 --> 05:39:15,400
I think the last time I played Apex was the last time I
streamed A... Wait, no.

4204
05:39:15,600 --> 05:39:17,620
The last time I played Apex was...

4205
05:39:17,620 --> 05:39:18,460
Wait, yeah.

4206
05:39:18,520 --> 05:39:25,240
The last time I played Apex was the last time I streamed
Apex, which was with and we just played that and then and

4207
05:39:25,240 --> 05:39:33,520
then we took a long break and now now we're back again so it
i i love i you know first person shooter it was always

4208
05:39:33,520 --> 05:39:39,460
really really fucking fun um because it's a different you
know it's first person versus third person it's it was

4209
05:39:39,460 --> 05:39:45,840
really nice to get back into it i love beaming people with
the r9 and everything i definitely am very rusty because it

4210
05:39:45,840 --> 05:39:51,980
has been a while since i've controlled like some of the guns
in i don't know r9 is like literally riding a bike i don't

4211
05:39:51,980 --> 05:40:01,840
really need to learn like relearn how to track but um the
other guns it took me a while to remember how to uh re like

4212
05:40:01,840 --> 05:40:07,280
to regain the muscle memory for it but i think like the
longer we went the better we get the longer we went the the

4213
05:40:07,280 --> 05:40:15,640
more we got back the skill uh so i hope you guys have fun
watching have fun watching me with too uh i told you guys

4214
05:40:15,640 --> 05:40:16,660

05:41:38,800 --> 05:41:46,200
to be part of this event um obviously like not a lot of
creators are picked for this each year so the fact that they

05:41:46,200 --> 05:41:53,300
picked me to be part of it and as one of first and the first
env tuber um to receive something and it's caused like an

4234
05:41:53,300 --> 05:42:00,880
actual character skin too is insane to think about and you

05:42:00,880 --> 05:42:05,960
you guys cheering me on while you guys watching me play
these types of games i wouldn't have been able to uh i

4236
05:42:05,960 --> 05:42:11,540
wouldn't have been able to have this experience and be able
to you know be part of something like this so Thank you,
