00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,600
Hello, everyone.

2
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,060
Oh, my gosh.

3
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:48,800
Whoa, sorry.

4
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,480
Hello.

5
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,620
Hello, everyone.

6
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,840
Sorry, sorry.

7
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,620
That we were a little late.

8
00:02:02,200 --> 00:03:16,340
But yes, for those who weren't reading chat and why I had to start late, I was I was had to emergency sub for a friend for rivals, charity tournament which is very poorly organized it was so fucking bad I was just I was supposed I was checking it out um and um and they literally were in the drafting phase for players and apparently half the players didn't even show up for the tournament and I was just like what like I was just listening and then they were apparently they got too many DPS slash tank players and not even enough support players and i was so fucking confused and then i was watching them argue for 30 minutes trying to beg players to sub in um for as like a support player it was so bad and i learned about this turn i heard about this turn that they've been planning on doing because they did an eu separate uh they did an eu version of this like last week and then um and then uh so then version because i was like uh my friend was telling me about the tournament that i was

9
00:03:16,340 --> 00:04:24,380
helping organize like that was helping as a player by the way he wasn't even uh like super gomez was telling me about this tournament and he was helping the organizer as a player to do like for uh as a player because he wanted to help out for charity so um so i was like oh okay like are you do you get anything out of it he's like no it's for charity i want to help and i want to help organize this for n a and i was like oh that's pretty cool and uh and then like uh they were wanted to do it um literally right after the eu tournament but they had only five players recruited and i literally told them i was like bro you gotta convince the organizer to delay it to next week because there is no way you're gonna find 40 plus players in two days because like because like it's telling me about it and i was like there's no way you're gonna find 40 plus players in two fucking days like you gotta tell them to delay it to next week because that's fucking stupid and so they delayed it to like this

10
00:04:24,380 --> 00:05:35,180
week and yeah and then like um apparently some of the organizers they found players but then like they didn't like fully confirm whether or not they were gonna show up so they just be like the the players would be like yeah i can do it but then they weren't even told the day of the tournament or the time of the tournament so it was like i felt so bad so for those who don't know this was it was under team captain's name but he had like i think like five percent involvement in this tournament from what i'm told and it was like outsourced to like a organizer team i thought it was mostly like eu organizers um but apparently there was like any people helping out as well but it was it was so fucking weird um so then i was watching and then i told him i told uh super gomez that i am willing to be an emergency sub because i felt so bad and also like super gomez has been like super like clutch um whenever like i wanted to like I want to play rivals and I needed to like you know um he was awake

11
00:05:35,180 --> 00:06:41,120
during like my degenerate hours and everything um and you know he played super long hours too and I felt really bad because I found out um later on that like um he had like wrist uh pain and stuff we're doing these long hours so like you know like he never complained about it to me too and um I wanted first off it was for uh charity it was for charity and I thought it was like you know um I'll do it for charity I'm not getting anything out of it and you know I felt so bad because I was listening to them argue for 20 fucking minutes straight uh I was literally listening for 20 minutes straight about them begging players trying to find a support player and everything so like I felt like Jesus Christ fine I'll I can I can emergency cell for this um and then um like and I wouldn't you me and shit like i just wanted to be a good friend uh because like uh he's been like super clutch for me like you know playing rivals uh organizing like rival stacks for me and stuff like that so i just

12
00:06:41,120 --> 00:07:01,200
figured like you know like and he did the vtuber rivals thing too like during the vtuber rivals he coached half our roster out of his own free time and also did like um and also like did vaude reviews and stuff for our team during vtuber rivals like he didn't have to do that Sentinels too and like scrimming and stuff.

13
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:10,940
And like doing scrims and stuff with us and like and also like researching the enemy team as well like during VTuber arrival.

14
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,880
Like he did all that shit.

15
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,860
So I was like, you know what?

16
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:21,540
That'd be, you know I wanted to like return the favor and you know, they just needed one player.

17
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,300
Like well they needed a lot of players.

18
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,000
So I was just like, I mean that's fine.

19
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,400
Like I can do it.

20
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:37,260
And but I like left because like i think that was literally one game because there's no there's no like loser brackets so

21
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:46,480
there was no so like we lost the game so i guess they're out now so i was like okay

22
00:07:49,720 --> 00:08:01,080
i was just like okay i guess they're out now i guess i can stream escape from duck cop i don't no, I don't know any of these rules.

23
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,760
It was, um, I don't know any of these rules.

24
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,620
So I literally, like, I'm just looking at, I was a bystander.

25
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:16,140
And then there were supposed to be like, okay, teams are supposed to be balanced.

26
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,420
And then it's supposed to be a snake draft.

27
00:08:18,640 --> 00:09:31,070
And because half the roster, half the players didn't show up for this tournament, um, or like dropped out at the last second because like apparently one of the players on super gomez's team um that i replaced um he didn't want to play with pizza this other player on that team so he was like i'm out like he saw which team he got drafted on and he was like i'm fucking out i'm not playing with this guy i'm like what the fuck crazy right so like some people are like oh yeah i'm fucking i'm like they literally dropped out at the last second it's wild like for charity by the way yeah it's understandable if you see the play okay you can drop like it's understandable if you have like conflict with someone in a tournament because i saw the player list and i was like oh i don't want to i hope i don't want to be on this uh team on this person because he's like apparently like known as being like super sexist or whatever um like in the rivals community and has like done like pretty uh has like

28
00:09:31,070 --> 00:10:35,970
done some pretty like fucked up shit um but you know and then so I was like when I saw the playlist I was like yeah I don't want to be on a team with that guy like if I joined this because I was asked if I wanted to I was just like but like you know if you see the playlist and you don't fuck with someone then just don't join the tournament it's just that easy like it's literally yes you'd be like oh just suck up just suck up and participate but like you know if you do have someone that you really don't want to play with just don't join the tournament because you don't know if you're gonna fucking get drafted on that team like you don't fucking know like and then um yeah and then uh because it's all r and g and shit like if i see i i do that i they give me i'd be like can i can i um can you tell me like who's gonna be like i'll be like oh can you tell me like who's gonna be part of this event or who's gonna be part of this like or like tournament and i see the list and i'll be like oh i

29
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:45,370
don't know i feel a little awkward maybe no it's all right i'll pass on that like shit like that like i've done that before it's so easy just say just say no

30
00:10:51,030 --> 00:11:16,230
and then um and then yeah Yeah, and it was and then like because half the play almost half the players didn't show up for this tournament It was so it like some teams were just grabbing random pros that said yes or like like top 100 players So like you know instead of like the players they drafted in the snake draft They're like literally like you top 100 player.

31
00:11:16,390 --> 00:12:51,830
You're on my can you stop in fab And then obviously my team got the short and the sick players and i'm not a professional by the way uh haven't played much of this season rank by the way like and also my other support player also hasn't really played much this season or much rivals at all like we were like yeah we can't help but hold me up and then we were up against like a full fucking professional team because that team also had half the roster not show up but they were managed to grab like professional players or like uh top 100 players it was i it was a little bit of a mess i just i just don't understand how this was so poorly organized i because it's such a bad look too um it's such i feel like if you know that this to be super organized you'd you know delay it you'd you know delay it don't keep going yeah like don't don't do this thing because it's like it's such a poor like yeah it it just looks bad you know and i just feel bad because like obviously it's like it's trying to do

32
00:12:51,830 --> 00:14:00,390
like a good thing to raise money for a good cause and everything this is why i you might have seen me not organize events this year it's because i've been so busy and i don't want to half-ass an event like i try to make sure everything is um everything is like okay and stuff so um i gotta make sure like everything is can will go okay and i don't want like any like um unpredictable variables and everything have everybody confirmed and stuff and make sure everyone can show up and even if they can't show up i have backups ready for it um so you can see i just don't have time i haven't had much time lately to organize anything this year because i've been so fucking busy with everything else that's going on um and you guys know like this year i had to like um a lot of shit have this year too and i've been traveling a lot as well and it's very stressful it's a very stressful thing and i usually don't even have a team when i'm organizing i i didn't even have a team when i organized my um my

33
00:14:00,390 --> 00:15:07,990
like wrestle tuber or um or like the apex event it was just mostly me gathering everything and like talking to people and everything um so i just can't believe i was like you had a team you had yeah and the birthday concert I organized that all by myself so I'm just like bro you had a team like how did that happen like yeah so I was just like how do I have didn't show up and everything and like obviously vibes were fucking off and everything because like you know people were just so frustrated um with how it was handled i feel really bad i felt really bad for like you know a lot of these players i felt really bad for super gomez because like he helped he helped like he did it out of his own free time for charity um and he wasn't even credited

34
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:40,130
of it i think there was i don't know i thought they made like a liquipedia or whatever and they didn't even credit him even though like he literally had to recruit like he was like begging players to like join the tournament and not begging i won't say that's the word he was like you know asking players and messaging a ton of players um and then i was watching the stream too because like you know he even asked me and i was like i don't know like i saw the raw player list and i was like I don't know.

35
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,290
And I was like, it's for charity.

36
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,070
And I was just like, I'll think about it.

37
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,130
And then like, because I could tell it was like, Trudeau not very well organized in general.

38
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,390
So that's why I was like hesitant in joining it.

39
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,330
But I literally did it.

40
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:56,530
I joined it last minute, just because like I did it as a homie.

41
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:02,510
Um, because, um, I, I just felt so bad, like watching all of this unfold.

42
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:06,450
And, and like, even it's like, no, you don't have to come.

43
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:07,290
You don't have to come.

44
00:16:07,470 --> 00:17:53,030
Like, focus on your stream like i feel like i feel really bad but i was like literally watching the show unfold and like i felt bad for like everyone i i just i just felt so bad for everyone involved uh so i was just like i it's that's fine like that's okay like yeah i'm looking at the the liquidpedia right now and like he's not even credited even though like and then he had to do the drafting he he was organized i was watching the stream and he was organizing the drafting himself even though he was like this isn't my job but i guess i have to do the snake draft as well i was like bro i was just like bro i like yeah and i'm looking at it and the entire producer like an eu like the team's all an eu like on for an egg tournament like are you even half of them awake for this like are even half of them awake right now like oh wait a moment bro it just sucks like it is for charity yeah at least like credit because I saw how hard like they've been like working I saw how hard like they were

45
00:17:53,030 --> 00:18:12,350
trying because they were trying to like get anyone and you know they even asked me if I could like ask some people too um yeah anyway other than that did you guys see the stock market sorry the CS goes sorry not CS the CS stock market crash today I want to talk about this I know you guys all want me to play duck off but This is very important,

46
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,430
but we had the biggest bubble burst of our entire lives.

47
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:18,310
I had two people message me about this.

48
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,970
And I was like, I was like, bro, I don't even play.

49
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,590
I don't, first off, I don't even like do CS.

50
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:33,750
Second off, it was such a big news that I had two people message me about.

51
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,190
It was literally a sell, sell, sell, sell.

52
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,310
Oh, wait, I bookmarked this tweet.

53
00:18:41,350 --> 00:19:34,930
so bad okay for those who don't know valve updated a new did a new pattern it's like it's a small update that literally destroyed like the the the stock the cs economy um so now for those who don't know the only way to get knives and gloves is you can have to open them in cases and buy like buy it but now you can trade up now so you can literally get shitty items and start trading up um and everything so you can trade like you and then apparently um the tier below knives and gloves are is reds and people were biting really we're buying really really shitty reds um um and trading them up so to get knives and gloves so it crashed the entire stock market because you can keep trading up so you can go from blues to like whatever the fucking colors are and then

54
00:19:38,750 --> 00:20:05,390
it was really bad because value dropped by like more than 60 percent of all knives like of everything except for the shitty reds yeah the one update wiped out one billion oh two billion dollars of value in like in in cs trading because cs trading is like crazy like

55
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:36,010
markets mark make their own disasters I I ends they give us super chat thank you thank you yes so okay I love this quote this is so people were like and because apparently there's some websites where you could instantly sell your stuff without having it affected by this so people were like sell sell sell like Like,

56
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:41,430
because some people, you know, some people didn't wake up in time to read the update.

57
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:48,290
So those who were awake for the update and realized what was going on instantly sold all their inventory before the crash happened.

58
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:51,870
Like before the people started waking up and realized about the crash.

59
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,350
Because they updated it.

60
00:20:53,570 --> 00:21:00,250
Because, like, apparently, majority of the market is in EU and Asia.

61
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:04,010
But they posted the update in NA time.

62
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:19,660
so people were buying up all the cheap ass reds um before like the eu and asia bros woke up and selling all the shitty stuff before they woke up

63
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:44,630
so yeah yeah so like people were like make we're like we gotta get it all get rid of everything get rid of it all and like I saw this fuck that freak the fuck out and panic sell everything right now it's fucking over

64
00:21:48,370 --> 00:22:02,730
yeah yeah yeah yeah it's so so so I saw it I was like holy shit the very real quote yeah yeah

65
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:40,910
so anyway so the entire economy collapsed now in um um in the the sea the yeah the the cs the cs economy and i saw this video too it was pretty crazy he was like so this is what my inventory was like before wait wait let me i'll put the so listen to this 58k dollars okay yeah now we make a shake let's see guys 58k to what 58k

66
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:59,270
by the way it went from 58k to 18k so like i could i can't be bothered to show the video but i gave you

67
00:23:02,750 --> 00:24:36,360
market crash of 1929 modernized so 58k one day within 24 hours he had his his mod item value was 18k in 24 hours now imagine what the value will be in another day like the pain was so audible like the cost was just god i had to talk about it was i was like reading up on it and and i was like because like i was i was like there at i was there at like uh what's the word called at point like when it happened wait there's a there's a word for it guys what's the word called like when you're there while it was happening like when it first started half ground zero yes I instantly I checked the CS trading what the CS the CS trading Reddit I had to know I I had to know what was going on there were there were some very interesting I went there I had to know I had to know like how did these people feel

68
00:24:40,400 --> 00:25:30,560
it was it was a i saw some wait let me second um because i was linking it to some of my the two of my friends who were i guess like really sad you know i thought maybe you know they can laugh they can laugh through their pain so these funny um these funny posts i know it's on reddit but like pretty funny um as an outsider looking in so i i linked this one um i linked i look i i thought it as an outsider i thought i was really funny i oh yeah um apparently a chinese skin trader lost about 900 000 today that's insane

69
00:25:35,540 --> 00:26:07,180
yeah no the like it just and also it like came out of nowhere like nobody it was like a small update that's literally how it went they're like a small we have a small update today uh that's very small update literally destroyed the entire economy That pros didn't mean.

70
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,080
They didn't even mention it in the update title.

71
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:16,000
So what this very small update is.

72
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:19,720
Alright.

73
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,600
Escape from Dupkhov.

74
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,640
It's basically Tarkov.

75
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,760
But better.

76
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,200
How might you ask it's better?

77
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,340
Well it's...

78
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,700
I will say...

79
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:39,220
They removed multiplayer, which is already an immense improvement from Tarkov.

80
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:47,440
It's, it's, they removed multiplayer from Tarkov, which already makes it so much better.

81
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,780
And, um, and we're, we're ducks.

82
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,380
We're basically ducks.

83
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,780
Like, holy shit, it's now playable.

84
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:02,540
Now we're talking game saved online is no more.

85
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:10,780
Yes, so, so, there's no multiplayer and your ducks, but it's basically Tarkov.

86
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:21,820
But without any of the bad side of Tarkov, they got rid of 100% of the toxicity.

87
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:27,700
Yeah, apparently the gun set is every, like, it's literally everything's the same.

88
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,260
It's just your duck.

89
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,640
Someone made a multiplayer.

90
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,360
Never mind.

91
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,440
They're like, this is too much of a good thing.

92
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,280
Zomber, thank you for the super chat.

93
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:44,660
Thank you.

94
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,520
Thank you.

95
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,680
Oh my god, wait.

96
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,260
I gotta put this here.

97
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,880
There's a research paper waiting to be written.

98
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,680
Yeah, we just can't have nice things.

99
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,120
People were like, how dare you ruin?

100
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,820
This game is too perfect.

101
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,260
Let me pat back multiplayer.

102
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:04,880
Let's see.

103
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:05,200
All right.

104
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,420
This sound got alive.

105
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,340

00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,780
Got to make sure everything.

112
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,560
You know, Duck Anatomy is pretty horrifying.

113
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:23,740
I agree.

114
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:24,960

120
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,840

00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,160
I might could turn this down overall.

124
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,840
All right, let me know if everything's good.

125
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:44,620
All right.

126
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,620
Let's see.

127
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:52,340
Can I actually add in mods?

128
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,920
Oh, I guess I have to go to, like, the workshop.

129
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,420
All right, let's try it out.

130
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,320
I heard it's...

131
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,600
The game is doing really, really well, right?

132
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,500
Like, there's so...

133
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,320
It's really popular in Asia.

134
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:07,920
because Tarkov is very popular.

135
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:12,100
Like every wipe, it's very, like Tarkov is like very, very popular in Asia in general.

136
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,580
So it is doing very well, right?

137
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:23,280
Like they had like a million player base for a single, yeah, a million copies sold for a single player game of a multiplayer idea.

138
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:30,740
Like not 100%, but still very challenging.

139
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,640
All right, here you go.

140
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,120

00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,300
Where's my stamina?

274
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,740
Where is my stamina bar?

275
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:20,200
God, I'm so thirsty, apparently.

276
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:23,160
Well, I don't even see my stamina bar.

277
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,720
Secret item, if you go all the way back?

278
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,080
What do I get?

279
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,420
Alright, I'll go all the way back.

280
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,380
I'm ready for a secret item.

281
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:36,000
I like secret stuff.

282
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,260
Okay, reloading.

283
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:41,700
A green circle?

284
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,720
Oh, I see it now.

285
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,200
I was looking down.

286
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,720
That's why I didn't see it.

287
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:50,100
Because you know, like, you expect to look down, you know?

288
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,420
I realize it's like right behind you.

289
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,360
Is it more poop?

290
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,440
Give it to me straight.

291
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:01,760
Is it more poop?

292
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:07,060

00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:18,040
It's a carrot Wait, is there even more wrong way turn back now.

00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,820

You said secret item There

297
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:47,370
I was told that it was a secret item.

298
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:50,170
And you're like, the carrot is a secret item.

299
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:52,610
What are you talking about?

300
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:54,890

00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:01,570

00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,620

Oh my god.

00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:00,320
That's okay.

320
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:00,980
I'm safe.

321
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,480
I'm safe now.

322
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,360
You're right.

323
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,540
Right, Boris.

324
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,080
Because I don't think I can get my shit back.

325
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:23,760
Guys, I have a feeling it's gone, gone, gone, run, run far away.

326
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,020
I don't think I'm getting it back, guys.

327
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,600
I think it's over for me.

328
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,100
You gotta fight for it.

329
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:38,800
I'll come back later.

330
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,660
Here's the other guy.

331
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:45,020
Come on.

332
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:46,080
Come on, get out of here.

333
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:47,220
There we go.

334
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,280
It's fine.

335
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,860
I don't need him.

336
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,920
But the secret item.

337
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,360
I'll come back when I'm stronger.

338
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:58,540
You cat.

339
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,560
I'll find a way.

340
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,880
There's nothing in here.

341
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:06,440
I got a heal though.

342
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:09,900
I had to use all my healing for that one area.

343
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:11,700
Fight or flight.

344
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:12,480
Exactly.

345
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,160
Alright, let's go this way.

346
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:20,750
One way.

347
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:22,850
It's two way, guys.

348
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:23,710
I can come back.

349
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:25,470
I'll come back, guys, I swear to God.

350
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:27,690
I'll come back.

351
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:31,790
She never came back.

352
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:33,110
Don't worry, guys.

353
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:34,150
I'll be back, guys.

354
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:35,930
Surely I'll be back right here.

355
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:37,870
Extracting.

356
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:42,030
Don't worry, guys.

357
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,030
I'll be there.

358
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:44,050
I'll be there.

359
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:48,610
There's an extraction, which means there is an insertion later.

360
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:53,350
That's why I need a P. I'll be right back.

361
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:49,050
And I'm back.

362
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:50,650
Oh, so sound guy.

363
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:52,930
I hope the sound has been okay so far.

364
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,010
Let me know if I have to adjust anything.

365
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:06,550
You like jazz.

366
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:10,430
Boom, boom, boom.

367
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:12,050
So I realized I had to turn this down.

368
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:16,730
Oh, they even Super Chat Smokey Krish.

369
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:19,070
What else?

370
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:19,310
Who else?

371
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:20,870
I need a alt tab for that.

372
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:29,910
Smokey Crush, Zechra, Maha, Smug, Hey guys, Never Sleeping Gavs, Matt, JL, Forward, Bite, Medi, and Allen.

373
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:31,190
Think of the super chat.

374
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:31,530
Thank you.

375
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:32,510
Thank you.

376
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:34,630
Thank you.

377
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:40,090
Oh, I could change my face, but why would I do it?

378
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:40,930
I'm ready perfect.

379
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:43,750
Oh, Capuchino, Cadence.

380
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:44,830
Let's go.

381
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:46,610
Oh, it's a workbench.

382
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:49,250
Alright, let's go.

383
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:49,810
Wait, what's this?

384
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:50,550
Is this my bed?

385
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:52,330
Oh, I can pass the time.

386
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:54,830
Wait, is this my empty house?

387
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:56,530
Oh, I guess this is where I live.

388
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:57,550
Hello!

389
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,330
Hey, you're finally awake.

390
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:01,190
Hey, Jeff.

391
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:02,450
This is your new year.

392
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:03,970
Here are a few things I need to explain.

393
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:08,150
I'll take care of logistics and everything else out here is in your hands.

394
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:11,170
This is the warehouse.

395
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:13,070
You can store your items here.

396
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:14,630
This is the construction panel.

397
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:17,110
You can build or dismantle facilities from here.

398
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:19,030
And this is the vending machine.

399
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:23,510
Not a wide selection of goods, but you can sell unwinded items to it as well.

400
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:26,710
This is, well, we'll just call it the enhancer.

401
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:29,850
Find the right materials and enhance your abilities.

402
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:31,970
Though it might come at a small cost.

403
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:34,890
This is the bunker exit you'll be heading up from here.

404
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:38,510
We don't have much of your name right now, so bring back as much as you can.

405
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:41,850
Before heading out, don't forget, I've got some quests for you.

406
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:43,650
Oh, sir, give me the quest.

407
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:45,630
All right, basic constructions.

408
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:47,170
Collect two pieces of wood.

409
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:49,490
Okay, I can do that.

410
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:50,910
You don't survive here.

411
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:52,390
I'll give you some startup capital.

412
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:53,010
Wow!

413
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,630
Are you gonna give me some CS skins?

414
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:57,090
This is before the crash.

415
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:00,230
This is before I knew about the crash.

416
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:01,370
Oh, my God.

417
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:06,690
Let me set up my entire, my entire worth on CS skins.

418
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:07,350
Oh, never.

419
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:12,370
Surely the market will never crash because it only goes up.

420
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:17,290
It's like those who like invested all their money into gold.

421
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:21,350
Uh...

422
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:22,670
Bye, bye, bye!

423
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:25,350
I can't wait to invest in CS skin.

424
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:25,950
I'll buy...

425
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:29,310
Yeah, I'll put the 401k into the skins.

426
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:32,210
Surely it'll always go up.

427
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:37,310
Do you want, like, a percentage in the stock market or a percentage in CS skins?

428
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:40,130
Kill any enemy.

429
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:41,030
Yeah, I can do that.

430
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:44,590
The gold will rise again, guys.

431
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:52,670
What's this?

432
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:54,130
Pick up locker.

433
00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:55,030
Okay, warehouse.

434
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:57,370
Oh, I got some milk.

435
00:52:57,530 --> 00:52:59,570
Okay, I can put this away, actually.

436
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:02,110
The...

437
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:02,450
What?

438
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:03,350
The milk.

439
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:05,150
Oh, it's like the glock.

440
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:07,650
Which is better.

441
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:09,330
Does it not have, like, a comparison?

442
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:10,650
I don't know what is better.

443
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:13,930
Current ammo 10, caliber S.

444
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:16,530
14, 11.

445
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:17,670
Oh, I should get the...

448
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:52,050
They don't see... Oh, wait, there's a duck there.

449
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:53,630
That's right.

450
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:55,150
Get shot at!

451
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:55,990
There you go.

452
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:57,990
This is my territory.

453
00:54:58,210 --> 00:54:59,110

454
00:54:59,210 --> 00:54:59,730

457
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:06,310

Yeah, let's put some aspirin here.

461
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:15,130

462
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:15,650
space.

463
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:17,170
I have a very small backpack.

464
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:17,990
Wait, what's this?

465
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:19,670
The data box.

466
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:20,750

Paper cash.

00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:26,390
I don't know what to do.

471
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,830
I guess I don't need two guns.

472
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:30,070

474
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:33,090

480
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:42,490
Drop.

Oh shit.

504
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:08,640

00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,600
Sitting waste time.

510
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:18,380

530
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,580
Is there wood here?

531
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:31,940

00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,220

00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:36,550
I'm in the duck economy.

543
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:39,210
I'm just a little duckling.

544
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:43,490
I'm like a peasant in the duck world.

545
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:46,690

Oh, so I can fish here.

554
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:05,670
Throw wood.

555
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:06,890
Oh, my God, wood!

556
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:10,450
That's actually the one thing we needed.

557
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:11,770
Okay, what do we not?

558
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:13,670
What can we throw away?

559
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:15,890
I don't feel that...

560
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:16,930
Yeah, we don't need...

561
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:17,470
We don't need that.

562
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:18,290
Let's just grab wood.

563
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:19,410
All right, let's go home.

564
01:01:19,890 --> 01:01:21,170
Let's go home, Dad.

565
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:23,890
If I can figure out how to get home.

566
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:25,010
Okay, this portal.

567
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:27,390
Oh, oh, the TP takes me back home.

568
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:28,990
That's so convenient.

569
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:32,750
Oh, that's what this is.

570
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:33,550
Alright.

571
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:34,990
Nice.

572
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:37,010
We're extracting.

573
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:42,790
I like how my helmet doesn't even cover my eyes.

574
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:50,910
Stay hydrated.

575
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:52,090
Extract.

576
01:01:57,410 --> 01:01:58,670
Can't build anything?

577
01:01:58,850 --> 01:02:00,630
No, because I need two fucking wood.

578
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:02,190

01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:05,390
Yay, I got my startup capital.

580
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:07,530
I claim all.

581
01:02:08,290 --> 01:02:12,390
If you have the right gear, you can take on those rampaging scavengers.

582
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:13,970
The red ones with butcher knives.

583
01:02:14,370 --> 01:02:16,370
Once you're done, I'll leave some bolts and nuts.

584
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:18,570
Okay, kill rampaging scavenger.

585
01:02:19,330 --> 01:02:20,770
I need a butcher knife.

586
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:21,590
Okay, that's easy.

587
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:23,670

You can't...

593
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:06,490
Well, technically you can hack in a single player game, but, like, I don't have to fight hackers.

594
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:07,350
You're right.

595
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:08,970
This is why it's so much better.

596
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:11,630

624
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:35,710
I don't remember where he lived.

625
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:37,310
Oh, is it this house?

626
01:04:37,390 --> 01:04:38,430
Oh, he's right next to me.

627
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:42,030
He lives here.

628
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:43,290
I got him this egg.

629
01:04:45,670 --> 01:04:49,470
Apple, soda, cracker, cola.

630
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:50,730
Am I hungry?

631
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:51,710
Oh, I'm thirsty.

632
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:52,650
Oh, crowbar.

633
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:53,690
Wait, let me...

634
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:55,410
I should have drink my soda right now.

635
01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:56,850
Yeah.

636
01:04:57,730 --> 01:04:59,650
Yeah, I saw that I was, like, super thirsty.

637
01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:01,550
All right, let's go.

638
01:05:03,110 --> 01:05:04,770
Let's go give him the egg.

639
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:07,550
Hey, bro.

640
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:10,150
I got you the egg.

641
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:17,230
Got you your goddamn protein, bro.

642
01:05:18,530 --> 01:05:19,010
There's one.

643
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:20,610
Oh, I got, I just got that.

644
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:24,710
So protein alone just isn't enough.

645
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:26,590
Carbs are important, too.

646
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:28,910
Go, fetch me a cookie.

647
01:05:29,490 --> 01:05:29,950
Run.

648
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:30,470
It's okay.

649
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:31,770
I literally just picked it up.

650
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:32,950
Yay.

651
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:34,930
I'm level two.

652
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:35,870
All right, what does he want?

653
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:38,270
He wants a cigarette.

654
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:39,270
Yeah, that's all.

655
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:41,130
Take care of the guys.

656
01:05:41,790 --> 01:05:45,910
Bro, I think, bro, I don't think the cigarette's going to solve anything, bro.

657
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:50,330
Still feels like something's missing.

658
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:54,330
As they say, smoking after a meal.

659
01:05:56,590 --> 01:05:58,810
Bring me a pack of smokes.

660
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:02,230
This is your final trial.

661
01:06:04,310 --> 01:06:05,430
Jesus Christ.

662
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:06,570
Oh, there's all this...

663
01:06:06,570 --> 01:06:07,010
Oh, wait.

664
01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:08,590
Look, he has his egg again.

665
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:10,150
Well, goink, my...

666
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:15,210
A breakfast of champions.

667
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:17,450
Bro, I don't know, bro.

668
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:19,350
I don't think...

669
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:21,570
I don't think a toilet cleaner.

670
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:23,930
I don't think...

671
01:06:23,930 --> 01:06:28,350
A pack of smokes might as healthy for you.

672
01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:31,110
He needs a mental...

673
01:06:31,110 --> 01:06:32,490
I'm just going to go back home.

674
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:36,510
I need, like, more inventory space, though.

675
01:06:36,770 --> 01:06:37,070
Oh, my God.

676
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:43,810
I forgot to, like, make him put away, like, the lighter feel that I got.

677
01:06:45,470 --> 01:06:46,890
Oh, this way.

678
01:06:50,850 --> 01:06:51,890
I go home.

679
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:54,230
What happens after dark?

680
01:06:54,890 --> 01:06:57,130
I thought fun things happened after dark.

681
01:06:58,310 --> 01:07:00,090
Don't push yourself too high.

682
01:07:00,290 --> 01:07:01,410
Don't worry, I'm coming home.

683
01:07:03,830 --> 01:07:04,610
You can get more...

684
01:07:04,610 --> 01:07:05,650
Oh, there is a skill tree.

685
01:07:06,050 --> 01:07:08,910
Am I too weak to access the skill tree right now?

686
01:07:10,310 --> 01:07:12,670
I can, oh, I can buy it, but, okay, nice.

687
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:14,550
It becomes more dangerous.

688
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:16,150
Oh, okay, that's what happens.

689
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:17,630
I was like, what happens at night?

690
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:20,930
Surely good things always happen at night, right?

691
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:24,530
Like, oh, I have enough.

692
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:26,690
Okay, there we go.

693
01:07:26,790 --> 01:07:28,310
I needed more of that, actually.

694
01:07:29,870 --> 01:07:30,590
That's nice.

695
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:32,050
Oh, my God, I can buy a B-Ball!

696
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:33,990
Oh, I can't buy a B-Ball on port.

697
01:07:34,130 --> 01:07:34,610
Never mind.

698
01:07:35,670 --> 01:07:36,590
I was so excited.

699
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:39,790
I was going to be like, I can buy a B-B-B.

700
01:07:40,010 --> 01:07:40,890
All right.

701
01:07:42,150 --> 01:07:43,310
Let's throw this away.

702
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:46,750
All right, let's...

703
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:48,150
Yeah, but I have double...

704
01:07:48,150 --> 01:07:48,770
Oh, wait.

705
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:54,200
Wait a minute.

706
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:57,720
Wait a minute.

707
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:00,440
My inventory did not expand.

708
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:03,380
Wait a minute.

709
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:07,160
It seems like my inventory stayed the same.

710
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:13,720
Wait.

711
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:18,450
Oh.

712
01:08:19,990 --> 01:08:20,730
Wait.

713
01:08:21,150 --> 01:08:21,990
What happened?

714
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:23,350
What did it do?

715
01:08:25,570 --> 01:08:26,250
Did it not?

716
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:28,690
Did it not give me more items?

717
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:31,090
Oh.

718
01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:33,270
Oh.

719
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:38,410
It was cosmetic.

720
01:08:39,010 --> 01:08:39,630
Oh.

721
01:08:40,470 --> 01:09:10,490
I just see pouch but forgot the most important word cosmetic I didn't notice the cosmetic part how do I sell oh sell okay I just press F um I don't know there's nothing here okay I'm selling this I'm selling it back all right oh a butcher knife I can craft that Nothing I really...

722
01:09:10,490 --> 01:09:13,130
A poop ball, which can be thrown.

723
01:09:13,330 --> 01:09:14,290
I just need a poop.

724
01:09:15,410 --> 01:09:18,790
Okay, I don't think there's anything I really need to buy.

725
01:09:20,830 --> 01:09:22,250
Okay, I got bandage.

726
01:09:23,050 --> 01:09:23,430
What else?

727
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:25,170
Bleeding control.

728
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:27,170
Oh, I've used that in that before.

729
01:09:27,850 --> 01:09:30,430
Fix the northern signal tower.

730
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:31,590
Letters.

731
01:09:31,690 --> 01:09:34,670
Submit letter from an old friend.

732
01:09:35,090 --> 01:09:36,510
Okay, I can do all that.

733
01:09:37,870 --> 01:09:38,470
Is it this?

734
01:09:38,530 --> 01:09:39,270
Is this a skill tree?

735
01:09:39,390 --> 01:09:39,730
Oh!

736
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:41,510
Oh, I don't know.

737
01:09:41,850 --> 01:09:42,990
Oh, I need to pay for it.

738
01:09:43,230 --> 01:09:44,410
It's pay to learn.

739
01:09:45,270 --> 01:09:45,490
Okay.

740
01:09:46,470 --> 01:09:47,890
Just like college.

741
01:09:48,910 --> 01:09:51,430
But then the learning part is sort of like just a suggestion.

742
01:09:53,370 --> 01:09:54,410
Survival instinct.

743
01:09:55,410 --> 01:09:56,450
Wide FOV.

744
01:09:56,590 --> 01:09:58,290
I feel like I'd rather get done.

745
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:02,900
But like it's a gotcha wave.

746
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,360
You actually do learn it.

747
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:07,020
If you do learn anything.

748
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:10,980
Yeah.

749
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:12,440
Okay, I don't have anything else.

750
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:14,900
That's got more backpack.

751
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:17,140
What is over here?

752
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:24,420
The farm town.

753
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:28,100
I mean, is this like the guy from Animal Crossing?

754
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:29,960
The Kappa from Animal Crossing?

755
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:36,640
Alright, cold caffeine.

756
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,240
It's so chill.

757
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:40,680
How much did I sleep?

758
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,720
Is that always still night?

759
01:10:45,440 --> 01:11:03,040

01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,120
I'm slightly above average.

762
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:18,120
Duck.

763
01:12:22,370 --> 01:12:23,870
Let's grab some crackers.

764
01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:26,110
Duck's hungry.

765
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:28,650
Is this one, right?

766
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:29,370
Oh, shit.

767
01:12:30,990 --> 01:12:31,470
Oh, my God.

768
01:12:31,490 --> 01:12:33,470
I was going to say, where's my bullets?

769
01:12:35,610 --> 01:12:37,010
Oh, fading feather.

770
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:39,190
Feels like it would disappear soon.

771
01:12:40,210 --> 01:12:41,510
I don't even know what that does.

772
01:12:43,550 --> 01:12:44,330
Rock would.

773
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:46,210
Reload.

774
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:49,290
Can I assume it's this.

775
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:51,490
Oh, there it is.

776
01:12:53,350 --> 01:12:54,470
I'm fixing.

777
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:58,830
Okay, I finished the objective.

778
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:01,090
Wait, does he have another blueprint for me?

779
01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:03,150
Oh, he does.

780
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:05,310
Wait, I can just farm blueprints off this guy.

781
01:13:06,190 --> 01:13:06,730
Nice.

782
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:11,100
Wait, who shot him?

783
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:13,340
Wait, who shot this dog?

784
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:14,980
Because I did not shoot this dog.

785
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:15,800
Despite what he was doing.

786
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:27,380
you just saw i swear i swear it wasn't me guys like you saw that right you got shot before i shot him

787
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:50,220
i can build this all right nice that's right never you never expect a duck from the bridge oh all right i can't run and gun with an ak which i've noticed It's a little annoying.

788
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:50,980
Oh my god, please.

789
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:56,060
I was hoping that I will find a bandage while walking around.

790
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:57,580
Oh my god, this guy has a shotgun.

791
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:00,000
Jesus Christ.

792
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:01,080
Oh, I'm bleeding.

793
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:02,520
I'm bleeding.

794
01:14:05,730 --> 01:14:06,510
There we go.

795
01:14:08,690 --> 01:14:09,170
I don't know.

796
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:13,790
I figured I'd get like a fucking bandage from this.

797
01:14:14,910 --> 01:14:19,730
Versus like me bringing my own bandage.

798
01:14:20,650 --> 01:14:21,810
Oh, go down.

799
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:22,410
Sure.

800
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:25,930
Oh, that was extraction point?

801
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:27,630
I thought it was just the sewers.

802
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:33,220
Oh, wait.

803
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:34,500
No, it is just the sewers.

804
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:40,940
Oh, that's cool.

805
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,240
Oh, it's the fading feathers.

806
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:44,980
Okay, what do I do for this?

807
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:52,310
Can I offer it?

808
01:14:53,290 --> 01:14:54,410
How do I offer it?

809
01:14:58,900 --> 01:14:59,380

01:15:35,310 --> 01:15:37,490
Oh, we'll just put this in here.

813
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:39,150

01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:53,270
What did I put down here?

818
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:54,110
That...

819
01:15:54,110 --> 01:15:54,870
Oh.

820
01:15:56,910 --> 01:15:58,490
Yeah, I need more bullets.

821
01:15:59,850 --> 01:16:00,770
Oh my god, I need this.

822
01:16:05,690 --> 01:16:07,450
Um, oh, this one.

823
01:16:07,790 --> 01:16:11,750
The T-O-TOS-66-45.

824
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:16,000
Wait.

825
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:17,320
Oh, I already have that.

826
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:18,140
JK.

827
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:19,960
I might get to sell it.

828
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:21,220
Actually, let me sell it.

829
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:23,060
Where is it?

830
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:27,480

831
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:29,500
Sell that.

832
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:40,720
Yeah, sell my doubles.

833
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:42,060
I feel like I don't need doubles.

834
01:16:45,420 --> 01:17:49,590

I'm just going to do regular gun.

836
01:17:52,270 --> 01:17:53,970
I think the AK is pretty garbage.

837
01:17:55,790 --> 01:17:56,270
I'm not AK.

838
01:17:56,370 --> 01:17:56,470
Sorry.

839
01:17:56,570 --> 01:17:58,950
I think the shotgun was pretty garbage.

840
01:17:59,190 --> 01:18:00,770
But also because I maybe...

841
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:04,670
Maybe it's just because I was a bit too far away.

842
01:18:08,990 --> 01:18:10,550
Do I have enough bullets for an AK?

843
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:15,370
Which one uses that?

844
01:18:16,970 --> 01:18:18,530
Yeah, rusty bullets.

845
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:19,970
Oh.

846
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:21,070
No, I don't.

847
01:18:21,810 --> 01:18:23,650
I only have small bullets.

848
01:18:24,630 --> 01:18:26,450
Yeah, the shotgun seems really bad.

849
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:27,450
I almost shot him.

850
01:18:31,390 --> 01:18:32,110
Well, you want yourself.

851
01:18:32,210 --> 01:18:33,430
You don't need this, right, Trader?

852
01:18:35,070 --> 01:18:35,910
Oh, there you go.

853
01:18:36,030 --> 01:18:37,150
Letters from an old friend.

854
01:18:39,270 --> 01:18:39,670
Surringe.

855
01:18:40,010 --> 01:18:40,550
Oh, there you go.

856
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:41,010
Nice.

857
01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:42,090
I actually needed this.

858
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:45,540
Alright.

859
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:49,140
I used the wrong one.

860
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:52,080
Oh, shit.

861
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:52,900
Dude, not the whiskey!

862
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:54,200
No, it's fine.

863
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:54,720
It's fine.

864
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:55,960
I'm feeling good now.

865
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:59,100
I'm not thirsty anymore.

866
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:00,800
Wait, what the fuck is that?

867
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:02,120
What the fuck?

868
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:04,240
There's aliens?

869
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:05,260
Oh!

870
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,960
Oh my god, it's last of us!

871
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:11,460
Oh,

872
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:16,700
whoa!

873
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:17,660
Okay, it's fine.

874
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:21,480
Yeah.

875
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:24,780
Oh my god.

876
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:25,620
Oh my god.

877
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:27,500
Nobody told me there's aliens.

878
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:33,520
Nobody said there were aliens!

879
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:36,420
Oh my god.

880
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:37,360
Oh my god.

881
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:38,440
Oh my god.

882
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:41,940
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

883
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:43,960
Okay.

884
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:45,040
Okay.

885
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:46,000
It's fine.

886
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:46,580
I'm...

887
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:47,140
I'm...

888
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:47,240
Please!

889
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:47,940
Oh!

890
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:54,020
He had a bomb!

891
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:02,960
We never said there were an alien.

892
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,880
I had stream sniped!

893
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:10,120
I can't believe it.

894
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:12,280
I'm naked now.

895
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:15,920
A bot stream started to me.

896
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:22,180
Alright, let's grab this real quick.

897
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:25,500
Oh my god.

898
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:26,940
My items.

899
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:28,280
That's fine.

900
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:29,380
I'm going in naked.

901
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,040
I'm getting my shit back.

902
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:33,820
I'm naked and afraid.

903
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,420
Oh yeah, I forgot I have a dodge.

904
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:37,260
Okay, I did not need to dodge anything there.

905
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:40,800
I just literally got shotgun to the face.

906
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,480
I was already so vulnerable.

907
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:43,280
See, I told you guys.

908
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:44,260
I didn't need to grab anything.

909
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:45,520
I already got a gun.

910
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:49,920
No one ever expects aliens.

911
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:52,380
What do I...

912
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:55,520
Um...

913
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:56,920
Alright, it's this way.

914
01:20:57,860 --> 01:21:00,580
I got grouped in the PvE.

915
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:04,420
Why did nobody stop him?

916
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:05,880
Nice, I grabbed that.

917
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:39,280
i'll get there like where's my pinpoint thing right click on the map oh there it is it's a little scuff though thing the right click a little scuff there you go i don't have any armor so this is like a little scary um what's this an unusual oh it's like Why can't I use my unused syringe?

918
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:40,060
I don't understand.

919
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:42,820
Oh, no.

920
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:43,720
Oh, no.

921
01:21:44,220 --> 01:21:49,520
Yeah, so what happened was that he had a shotgun, and then I was, like, next to him.

922
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:52,480
So, like, you know, not the smartest thing to do.

923
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,620
Okay, I got the AK back, but I don't know if I have the ammo for it.

924
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:00,660
I do.

925
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:01,120
Okay.

926
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:05,120
Now I just don't really have the healers, too.

927
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:10,540
Yeah, we can grab another blueprint, at least.

928
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:13,300
Medicine box.

929
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:14,260
Oh, thank God.

930
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:18,560
It removes bleed status and grant immunity to bleed.

931
01:22:18,820 --> 01:22:19,960
All right, we need that.

932
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:22,000
Do I have less?

933
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:24,100
Oh, I do have less inventory.

934
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,380
Just because of...

935
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:29,220
Oh, this is bad.

936
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:33,740
Feel that.

937
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:36,340
Now I'll keep everything.

938
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:39,320
I mean, these items aren't that important.

939
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:42,540
Okay, let's hope that the mushrooms don't get me.

940
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:44,620
Okay, it does take stamina.

941
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:46,460
I don't think the mushrooms are here anymore.

942
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:47,660
What the fuck?

943
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:50,160
That mushroom was an RNG spawner?

944
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:53,560
And then it actually spawns?

945
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:59,140
Oh my god, there's actual spread.

946
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:05,220
Oh my god, where the fuck did that guy come from?

947
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:06,460
Oh, this is bad.

948
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:09,140
Oh, this is bad.

949
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:11,220
Oh, this is bad.

950
01:23:14,730 --> 01:23:15,670
There we go.

951
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:19,430
Okay, nice.

952
01:23:20,570 --> 01:23:21,450
Oh my god, thank god.

953
01:23:21,570 --> 01:23:23,150
I actually needed the aspirin.

954
01:23:26,810 --> 01:23:27,250
Alright.

955
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:31,550
Actually, I ate the wrong one, but that's okay.

956
01:23:32,610 --> 01:23:33,450
Oh, thank god.

957
01:23:33,570 --> 01:23:34,490
I need all of this.

958
01:23:36,390 --> 01:23:37,210
And $20?

959
01:23:38,190 --> 01:23:39,230
Merry Christmas.

960
01:23:40,770 --> 01:23:41,110
Okay.

961
01:23:45,290 --> 01:23:45,810
Okay.

962
01:23:45,830 --> 01:23:50,330
Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, it's okay, he can't even hide it.

963
01:23:51,230 --> 01:23:52,330
Oh god.

964
01:23:54,090 --> 01:23:56,210
Oh wait, maybe I should...

965
01:23:56,210 --> 01:23:57,910
Oh my god, wait!

966
01:23:58,710 --> 01:23:58,730
Oh!

967
01:24:03,610 --> 01:24:04,210
Oh!

968
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:07,750
Okay, wait.

969
01:24:10,510 --> 01:24:11,450
Got more ammo.

970
01:24:12,330 --> 01:24:14,070
I got more ammo.

971
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:16,190
Where is he?

972
01:24:16,470 --> 01:24:18,090
That's fucking right, bitch.

973
01:24:18,250 --> 01:24:19,030
I'm back.

974
01:24:19,530 --> 01:24:20,910
Oh shit!

975
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:23,490
Oh no!

976
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:35,380
Guys, I was in fact not back.

977
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:36,800
I...

978
01:24:38,380 --> 01:24:39,300
It's okay.

979
01:24:39,740 --> 01:24:40,400
It's okay.

980
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:40,880
Alright.

981
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:45,240
Now that I know what I need to...

982
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:47,880
Oh my god, that scared me.

983
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:49,140
I was like, they took everything.

984
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:52,800
How did they take it?

985
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:54,120
Okay, I have app.

986
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:55,280
Now I know.

987
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,300
Now I know.

988
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:01,000
It's okay.

989
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:02,260
It's okay.

990
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:04,320
I can grab it all back.

991
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:06,520
This is it right here, right now.

992
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:07,840
I know where it is.

993
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:08,300
All right.

994
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:11,840
And I have enough bullets for it.

995
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:14,040
As is this way.

996
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:15,880
Okay, I don't...

997
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:16,060
Okay.

998
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:18,120
Okay, I should stop grabbing stuff.

999
01:25:18,220 --> 01:25:19,340
I don't need any of this.

1000
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:21,380
I need to get back first.

1001
01:25:24,510 --> 01:25:25,210
All right.

1002
01:25:28,010 --> 01:25:31,870
How do you control recoil in a fucking top-down shooter?

1003
01:25:36,130 --> 01:25:38,270
We're just gonna book it.

1004
01:25:42,090 --> 01:25:42,590
All right.

1005
01:25:44,190 --> 01:25:45,650
We don't need to grab any of this.

1006
01:25:48,110 --> 01:25:49,170
We'll just go here.

1007
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:55,090
All right.

1008
01:25:55,330 --> 01:25:56,450
Oh, please don't tell me that much.

1009
01:25:56,630 --> 01:25:57,290
That's not...

1010
01:25:57,290 --> 01:25:57,710
Oh, God.

1011
01:25:59,030 --> 01:25:59,510
Oh.

1012
01:25:59,610 --> 01:26:01,030
Oh, they're fighting someone else.

1013
01:26:01,430 --> 01:26:01,470
Nice.

1014
01:26:02,130 --> 01:26:02,990
They don't know.

1015
01:26:03,930 --> 01:26:05,790
That's where I died.

1016
01:26:14,660 --> 01:26:15,020
Alright.

1017
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:18,980
Oh my god.

1018
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:19,980
Reloading.

1019
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:20,900
Reloading.

1020
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:22,580
Oh my god.

1021
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:23,720
Reloading still.

1022
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:25,240
There we go.

1023
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:29,200
Oh my god, he has...

1024
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:30,220
Wait, that's not fair.

1025
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:31,840
He has a bulletproof vest.

1026
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:33,160
Wait, that's not fair.

1027
01:26:34,820 --> 01:26:35,340
It's okay.

1028
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:35,940
He doesn't know.

1029
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:39,300
There we go.

1030
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:42,820
Uh, oh my god.

1031
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:44,920
Now I have the bulletproof vest.

1032
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:46,460
We need to put this.

1033
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:50,220
Okay, we don't need that because we already have the cosmetics.

1034
01:26:50,660 --> 01:26:51,860
Okay, we might need this.

1035
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,700
Uh, actually we don't need that.

1036
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:56,800
Wait, damage 11.

1037
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:57,340
Okay, wait.

1038
01:26:57,540 --> 01:26:59,400
I'd rather have the lick.

1039
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:01,940
Aspirin.

1040
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:04,500
Where the fuck is the... Where did I put the med kit?

1041
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,040
Oh, I threw it here.

1042
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:07,560
Okay, there you go.

1043
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:08,860
That's where I put the mud kit.

1044
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:11,260
All right, let's get the aspirin in fast.

1045
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:13,180
I don't feel so good.

1046
01:27:14,140 --> 01:27:14,440
All right.

1047
01:27:16,660 --> 01:27:18,620
All right, now I gotta grab my...

1048
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:19,380
No!

1049
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:21,940
Wait, my other grave disappears?

1050
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:24,580
Why did no one tell me?

1051
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:30,800
How could no one tell me this very important thing?

1052
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:33,920
Okay, there you go.

1053
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:36,640
That's everyone, right?

1054
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:37,860
That lives here?

1055
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:40,700
Now I live here.

1056
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:45,940
Wait, that's better.

1057
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:47,100
Oh, shit.

1058
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:47,820
Oh, shit.

1059
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:49,180
Oh, my God.

1060
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:50,280
There we go.

1061
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:52,480
That's a better backpack.

1062
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:54,640
If I do say so myself.

1063
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:57,560
Oh, my God.

1064
01:27:57,720 --> 01:27:58,640
I got a better backpack.

1065
01:28:00,620 --> 01:28:00,980
All right.

1066
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:01,980
Looting.

1067
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:03,080
Ooh.

1068
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:06,960
Plus 17...

1069
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:08,440
wrap this.

1070
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:11,700
Oh my god.

1071
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:12,940
Merry Christmas.

1072
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:16,580
Merry Christmas to me.

1073
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:17,300
It's early.

1074
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:18,540
We skipped Halloween.

1075
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:24,000
Okay, we have get extracted here.

1076
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:27,100
I don't feel comfortable holding all this loot.

1077
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:29,640
Okay, there's an extraction point right there.

1078
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:31,520
All right.

1079
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:32,900
They're loading.

1080
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:38,920
Okay, there's nothing Does this dog not give any loot?

1081
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:39,660
Is that poop?

1082
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:40,320
Oh, nice.

1083
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:41,260
We got our poop ball.

1084
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:42,900
I still don't know what it does.

1085
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:44,300
Oh, it can be thrown.

1086
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:45,520
Wait, how do I throw this?

1087
01:28:48,340 --> 01:28:50,080
Wait, how do I throw the poop ball?

1088
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:52,480
Wait, is there anyone I can throw it at?

1089
01:28:58,180 --> 01:28:59,240
Oh, I hear a quack.

1090
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:00,940
Ah!

1091
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:02,460
That's right.

1092
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:03,740
Get pooped!

1093
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:07,160
There we go.

1094
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:09,120
Holy shit, he did so much damage.

1095
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:12,320
Oh my god, he got cigarettes, too.

1096
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:13,780
We did it!

1097
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:15,600
We're gonna fix mental health!

1098
01:29:16,420 --> 01:29:17,160
Are extracting?

1099
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:24,940
My intrusive thoughts almost won there.

1100
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:27,180
Get shadowed.

1101
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:36,060
I saw I saw the barrels and I was this close.

1102
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:39,900
It almost won.

1103
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:42,440
Alright, let's get that.

1104
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:44,720

01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:21,340
There's a standard shotgun, standard bullet.

1108
01:30:22,940 --> 01:30:26,000
Yeah, we got a...

1109
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,800

1111
01:30:31,660 --> 01:30:32,020

1112
01:30:32,020 --> 01:30:32,400
Oh, wait.

1113
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:32,960
Fuck.

1114
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:33,900
Where's the cigarettes?

1115
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:35,660
Wait, the cigarettes were important.

1116
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:38,270
Oh, there you go.

1117
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:40,240
I'll put all of this away.

1118
01:30:42,620 --> 01:30:43,560
Keep the AK.

1119
01:30:44,620 --> 01:30:44,700
Okay.

1120
01:30:45,380 --> 01:30:46,880
What does the AK take?

1121
01:30:48,580 --> 01:30:49,840
Ammo type not set?

1122
01:30:50,620 --> 01:30:51,260
What the fuck?

1123
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:53,680
Oh, it's repairable?

1124
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:55,420
Oh my god, wait.

1125
01:30:58,080 --> 01:30:58,900
Oh, shit.

1126
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:03,740
I did not realize these guns required, like, extra.

1127
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,440
Like, extra stuff.

1128
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:11,120
I did not realize there's durability.

1129
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:13,040
There's durability?

1130
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:14,700
Okay, get this gun out of here.

1131
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:15,020
here.

1132
01:31:15,940 --> 01:31:16,620
We're gonna store this.

1133
01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:19,480
Rusty bullet.

1134
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:20,620
You don't even have...

1135
01:31:20,620 --> 01:31:21,120
Oh, I do.

1136
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:21,460
Okay.

1137
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:22,500
There we go.

1138
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:23,740
AK-7.

1139
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:24,260
You know.

1140
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:27,980
I didn't realize there was durability I have to repair it?

1141
01:31:28,460 --> 01:31:29,600
Alright, let's research health.

1142
01:31:30,380 --> 01:31:31,200
That's important.

1143
01:31:32,780 --> 01:31:33,280
Get that.

1144
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:35,260
And then we'll get recoil control too.

1145
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:37,980
Wait, I we need another backpack.

1146
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:40,400
Yeah, plus four.

1147
01:31:43,260 --> 01:31:43,820
And...

1148
01:31:43,820 --> 01:31:44,260
Alright.

1149
01:31:46,200 --> 01:32:00,030
oh my god truly is oh never mind we gotta go we gotta sleep it's nappy time i don't go got i can't go past my bedtime all right here you go

1150
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:50,700
all right i can see how this can be addicting for people who like tarcov like knowing that you know you won't get headshot 500 miles away like i can i feel like in tarkov i know a lot of people are like super paranoid in tarkov because you can literally get headshot from like across the map and just suddenly lose everything like yeah that seems really nice now no i've never played tarkov before because of that Because of that.

1151
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,540
No, yeah, and there's no long queue time, too.

1152
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:56,860
If I shoot this, oh, I knew it.

1153
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,160
I was gonna be...

1154
01:32:58,160 --> 01:32:58,780
Oh, shit.

1155
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:05,460
Can't help but, like, reload every time.

1156
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:07,840
Like, it makes sense, you know.

1157
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:10,140
That's... It seems very annoying.

1158
01:33:11,060 --> 01:33:11,900
Oh, close.

1159
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:13,340
Ooh, I get a lantern.

1160
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:17,140
Oh, yeah, and the queue time is, like, really bad, too.

1161
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:18,320
Oh.

1162
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:18,580
Oh.

1163
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:21,140
There you go.

I need to go back to that big area.

1222
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:02,280
That's where I got the good shit.

1223
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:06,300
But I don't have good shit to go to the big area.

01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:12,300
Three out of rubber, where I could carry 27 items.

1225
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:14,400
Those were the good.

1226

I was like, wow, I'm so lucky.

1301
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:35,160

It's fine.

1305
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:44,940
A little bit of bleeding won't hurt anybody.

1306
01:46:45,940 --> 01:46:46,640
What the fuck?

1307
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:48,680

I didn't learn to tap that.

1309
01:46:51,340 --> 01:46:53,120
Not the duck, but, like, the gun.

1310
01:46:57,980 --> 01:46:59,220
It's gotta clarify.

1311
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:00,860
I don't mean tapping the duck.

1312
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:02,040
I just meant the gun.

1313
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:09,300
Alright, we gotta go this way.

1314
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:12,240

01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:36,560
Then watch out, I just bring his shit.

1329
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:40,120
I have eight bullets left

1330
01:48:43,480 --> 01:49:10,870

This is so bad.

1333
01:49:21,790 --> 01:49:25,750
Oh my god!

1334
01:49:26,010 --> 01:49:26,870
Do I need to do one?

1335
01:49:37,950 --> 01:49:40,190
I didn't have enough.

1336
01:49:40,730 --> 01:49:44,130
I didn't have enough stamina.

1337
01:49:44,770 --> 01:49:46,810
Bro, I didn't have enough.

1338
01:49:47,830 --> 01:49:49,890
There's nothing I can do.

1339
01:49:50,730 --> 01:49:52,790
I had no more stamina.

1340
01:49:54,990 --> 01:49:55,730
Okay, wait, wait.

1341
01:49:55,850 --> 01:49:56,590
I got this.

1342
01:49:56,750 --> 01:49:58,230
Wait, I think I can take him down.

1343
01:49:58,530 --> 01:50:00,330
I have a plan.

1344
01:50:03,870 --> 01:50:05,370
Guys, I have a plan.

1345
01:50:05,570 --> 01:50:06,810
Okay, wait, we gotta grab this, though.

1346
01:50:08,010 --> 01:50:08,750
Watch this.

1347
01:50:09,910 --> 01:50:10,630
I'll reload.

1348
01:50:13,230 --> 01:50:15,270
He can sprint and reload.

1349
01:50:16,130 --> 01:50:17,150
Oh, I should have done that.

1350
01:50:17,290 --> 01:50:18,970
Why didn't I do that, guys?

1351
01:50:22,370 --> 01:50:51,580
I thought I looked so cool though But I did look cool Until I ran out of stamina I did look pretty cool Until I ran out Okay this is it So don't have a lot of bullets though Which is sort of The worst part of this plan Okay we're gonna We're gonna put the shot Shotgun.

1352
01:50:53,260 --> 01:50:55,620
Okay, I have shotgun for him this time.

1353
01:50:56,120 --> 01:50:57,960
This time, we got this.

1354
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:00,080
Okay.

1355
01:51:01,260 --> 01:51:03,040
I think I can kill that man of light.

1356
01:51:05,680 --> 01:51:06,900
I think it's possible.

1357
01:51:10,740 --> 01:51:11,260
Wait,

1358
01:51:21,170 --> 01:51:21,690

1359
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:27,600
Guys, it's not pot...

1360
01:51:35,310 --> 01:51:35,830
Okay.

1361
01:51:36,790 --> 01:51:52,550
Guys, it was it was not possible It was it was it was not possible guys guys there was no way I could get a barrel shot with what he was fucking doing guys

1362
01:51:56,890 --> 01:52:07,890
I could I got look when he was running at me I had so much fear like it was just he had just so much And I had none.

1363
01:52:08,310 --> 01:52:08,810
I could.

1364
01:52:08,930 --> 01:52:09,070
Okay.

1365
01:52:09,130 --> 01:52:10,230
I think I could do it.

1366
01:52:10,470 --> 01:52:11,650
I understand now.

1367
01:52:12,430 --> 01:52:13,350
I figured it out.

1368
01:52:13,450 --> 01:52:13,850
Oh, wait.

1369
01:52:13,930 --> 01:52:14,790
There's a duck here.

1370
01:52:17,330 --> 01:52:17,730
Okay.

1371
01:52:17,770 --> 01:52:20,210
Let's get rid of him first before I figure it out.

1372
01:52:21,890 --> 01:52:23,990
He had all the confidence in the world.

1373
01:52:24,050 --> 01:52:25,050
And I'm just a duck.

1374
01:52:27,830 --> 01:52:28,230
Okay.

1375
01:52:28,550 --> 01:52:29,210
This time.

1376
01:52:29,290 --> 01:52:30,090
I figured it out.

1377
01:52:31,170 --> 01:52:32,930
I think I can do it this time.

1378
01:52:36,610 --> 01:52:37,010
Okay.

1379
01:52:37,010 --> 01:52:37,630
This is it.

1380
01:52:37,770 --> 01:52:38,810
This is the game changer.

1381
01:52:39,750 --> 01:52:40,650
Right here.

1382
01:52:40,710 --> 01:52:43,110
I'm running out of inventory space.

1383
01:52:43,350 --> 01:52:45,070
Picking up my own dead bodies' equipment.

1384
01:52:48,010 --> 01:52:49,070
That's shotgun.

1385
01:52:49,570 --> 01:52:50,770
Okay, this is it.

1386
01:52:51,490 --> 01:52:52,350
Right here.

1387
01:52:53,770 --> 01:52:54,650
Right now.

1388
01:52:55,970 --> 01:52:56,910
This is it.

1389
01:53:02,380 --> 01:53:04,660
It doesn't help that he's so fucking fast.

1390
01:53:07,900 --> 01:53:08,680
Wait, he's gone.

1391
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:12,540
He was like, I'm done.

1392
01:53:14,060 --> 01:53:15,140
That was fun.

1393
01:53:15,320 --> 01:53:16,680
I'm heading home.

1394
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:19,620
Like...

1395
01:53:19,620 --> 01:53:21,560
It's just like...

1396
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:24,080
That was a fun little game that we had.

1397
01:53:24,740 --> 01:53:25,800
He got bored.

1398
01:53:25,960 --> 01:53:26,920
He went home.

1399
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:32,460
There we go.

1400
01:53:36,580 --> 01:53:38,360
All right, I got more feathers.

1401
01:53:39,260 --> 01:53:40,000
Oh, shit.

1402
01:53:41,140 --> 01:53:41,900
All right, nice.

1403
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:45,940
Got more shotgun.

1404
01:53:50,260 --> 01:53:51,040
Okay, nice.

1405
01:53:51,340 --> 01:53:52,360
Do I have any more inventory?

1406
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:52,840
Oh, I do.

1407
01:53:53,460 --> 01:53:55,480
I like three more slots, but I have to go home.

1408
01:53:58,280 --> 01:53:59,140
Alright, let's head home.

1409
01:53:59,980 --> 01:54:01,000
I don't trust myself.

1410
01:54:01,180 --> 01:54:05,540
It's almost nighttime, and I'm too scared to find out what nighttime brings me.

1411
01:54:07,620 --> 01:54:08,140
Alright.

1412
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:10,320
I'm actually too scared.

1413
01:54:10,760 --> 01:54:13,380
Nighttime seems very, very, very dangerous.

1414
01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:16,480
Wait, what's in here?

1415
01:54:17,740 --> 01:54:19,220
Hammer, nail.

1416
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:20,980
Okay, I don't have that.

1417
01:54:23,540 --> 01:54:26,500
All right, uh, we gotta go this way.

1418
01:54:29,180 --> 01:54:30,960
I wish I was fast travel.

1419
01:54:31,740 --> 01:54:33,080
I wish I could have, like, a motorcycle.

1420
01:54:36,020 --> 01:54:38,080
My little toes hurt.

1421
01:54:39,660 --> 01:54:41,760
I have to run so much.

1422
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:43,520
My little feetsies.

1423
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:48,520

There we go.

1433
01:56:18,070 --> 01:56:19,350
I can't upgrade my storage.

1434
01:56:20,110 --> 01:56:21,190
Is it for later?

1435
01:56:24,470 --> 01:56:25,010
Okay.

1436
01:56:32,570 --> 01:56:33,330

01:56:39,950 --> 01:56:41,410
Let's see...

1439
01:56:41,410 --> 01:56:43,430
Oh yeah, way too many of that.

1440
01:56:45,990 --> 01:56:46,970
Get this out.

1441
01:56:48,170 --> 01:56:49,670
Uh, get you out.

1442
01:56:50,090 --> 01:56:51,150
Alright, there you go.

1443
01:56:54,230 --> 01:56:54,990
Uh...

1444
01:56:54,990 --> 01:56:57,850
I mean, I could craft bullets.

1445
01:56:58,810 --> 01:56:59,570
Or...

1446
01:56:59,570 --> 01:57:00,650
Or...

1447
01:57:00,650 --> 01:57:01,970
I hoard my equipment.

1448
01:57:05,090 --> 01:57:07,390
And I want to do a quick reload.

1449
01:57:13,420 --> 01:57:14,760
The TT are not great weapon.

1450
01:57:15,080 --> 01:57:16,060
Okay, I'll get rid of that.

1451
01:57:17,780 --> 01:57:18,760
I'll sell it.

1452
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:20,600
Or is it called this one?

1453
01:57:23,200 --> 01:57:24,700
Oh yeah, I have a lot of this.

1454
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:26,980
I don't even know why I have that much.

1455
01:57:28,180 --> 01:57:29,940
I can't craft anything.

1456
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:31,400
I'm broke.

1457
01:57:32,380 --> 01:57:34,460
I don't have a light bulb.

1458
01:57:35,020 --> 01:57:37,120
I don't have an MD40.

1459
01:57:37,620 --> 01:57:40,180
Oh my god, what do you need a goddamn tire?

1460
01:57:41,120 --> 01:57:42,360
There's like 20 cars.

1461
01:57:42,460 --> 01:57:43,320
You fucking bring it.

1462
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:44,120
It's bring your own.

1463
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:46,020
Bring your own build.

1464
01:57:48,680 --> 01:57:49,400
All right.

1465
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:51,500
Let's go.

1466
01:57:52,200 --> 01:57:53,540
I give you the metal sheets.

1467
01:57:53,700 --> 01:57:54,760
You bring me a tire.

1468
01:57:55,680 --> 01:57:56,680
It's like a potluck.

1469
01:58:01,470 --> 01:58:03,170
Like there's cars everywhere.

1470
01:58:03,490 --> 01:58:06,290
Why do I have to fucking find a tire?

1471
01:58:07,490 --> 01:58:09,830
I think like outside his house is a car.

1472
01:58:09,910 --> 01:58:11,730
I'm pretty sure.

1473
01:58:15,580 --> 01:58:18,320
Yeah, I need like 8k ammo so badly.

1474
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:21,720
I will go this way.

1475
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:24,680
Hello?

1476
01:58:29,980 --> 01:58:30,620
Kablui.

1477
01:58:31,120 --> 01:58:32,180
That's fucking right.

1478
01:58:34,680 --> 01:58:36,160
Oh my god, thank god.

1479
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:36,660
Is that?

1480
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:37,260
Nope.

1481
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:40,380
Yeah, this has to be ammo for...

1482
01:58:40,380 --> 01:58:42,560
Oh my god, 175?

1483
01:58:43,400 --> 01:58:44,340
Bro, I'm fucking rich.

1484
01:58:44,840 --> 01:58:46,600
That's a lot of bullets.

1485
01:58:47,540 --> 01:58:48,460
Am I hungry?

1486
01:58:49,020 --> 01:58:49,860
Yeah, I am.

1487
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:51,680
Go eat my carrot.

1488
01:58:54,640 --> 01:58:56,240
That's a lot of food.

1489
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:02,620
I will go this way.

1490
01:59:05,060 --> 01:59:06,840
I'm no longer broke.

1491
01:59:08,080 --> 01:59:09,880
Oh, it's because I use this pistol ammo.

1492
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,580
I was going to say, like, that's so many, so much ammo.

1493
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:15,400
I didn't realize I was using pistol ammo.

1494
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:18,120
One day...

1495
01:59:18,140 --> 01:59:20,720
These crafting materials will be important.

1496
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:22,820
One day.

1497
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:28,920
Grab this.

1498
01:59:35,390 --> 01:59:36,090
Alright.

1499
01:59:38,530 --> 01:59:40,450
I'll go here.

1500
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:47,080
See, where the fuck did the aliens go?

1501
01:59:48,040 --> 01:59:49,340
They disappeared.

1502
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:52,260
They fucking shot me and then like...

1503
01:59:52,260 --> 01:59:53,520
They're like, see ya.

1504

Peace.

1505
01:59:55,910 --> 01:59:58,660
They sent a message and never returned.

1506
01:59:58,680 --> 02:00:00,200
Oh, wait, what the fuck?

1507
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:01,060
Oh, shit!

1508

There you go.

1509
02:00:05,460 --> 02:00:07,240
Oh, they spawned in another rain.

1510
02:00:07,420 --> 02:00:08,500
Okay, that makes more sense.

1511
02:00:08,620 --> 02:00:10,780
I was going to say, where the fuck did they come from?

1512
02:00:11,960 --> 02:00:13,320
There's peace down.

1513
02:00:14,620 --> 02:00:21,700
The shoot, yeah, they abducted me and they were like, that's enough for today.

1514
02:00:26,840 --> 02:00:27,020
Oh.

1515
02:00:27,880 --> 02:00:28,820
What the fuck?

1516
02:00:28,820 --> 02:00:29,780
Oh, that was a tree.

1517
02:00:29,920 --> 02:00:33,340

1521
02:01:21,270 --> 02:01:22,190
Anything important here?

1522
02:01:22,530 --> 02:01:23,510
Okay, carrot, feather.

1523
02:01:24,570 --> 02:01:25,530
Okay, more bullets.

02:01:28,470 --> 02:01:28,990
Shotgun.

Quick, sorry, I'm fucking getting that.

1526
02:01:32,850 --> 02:01:34,550
Alright, let's go extract.

1527
02:01:34,870 --> 02:01:36,150
I'm next to extraction point.

1528
02:01:40,640 --> 02:01:41,800
Oh, wait, what?

1529
02:01:42,020 --> 02:01:43,140
Special bullet?

1530
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:46,420
I don't need carrots.

1531
02:01:47,440 --> 02:01:48,460
I'll drop that.

1532
02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:49,640
I'll grab the special bullet.

1533
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:51,520
It looks special.

1534
02:01:52,980 --> 02:01:53,680
Alright, let's head home.

1535
02:01:56,120 --> 02:01:57,320
I'm ready to get extracted.

1536
02:02:03,260 --> 02:02:03,900
Stupid.

1537
02:02:04,420 --> 02:02:05,640
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1538
02:02:05,780 --> 02:02:06,000
No!

1539
02:02:07,380 --> 02:02:09,580
I want to see him shoot himself.

1540
02:02:11,780 --> 02:02:14,220
I was just standing next to the barrel.

1541
02:02:15,100 --> 02:02:15,320
Alright.

1542
02:02:16,920 --> 02:02:17,200
Oh.

1544
02:02:30,180 --> 02:02:47,860
Alright I'm back It's definitely a slow grind I feel like I'm taking It's taking me like a very long time I don't know if it's just because the way I'm playing it Maybe it's just the way I'm playing it That makes it Unless I feel like Tarkov is very grindy Right?

1545
02:02:48,860 --> 02:02:50,240
It's very grindy in general

1546

It's a 1.

1582
02:06:16,910 --> 02:06:17,790
Oh, thank God.

1583
02:06:19,210 --> 02:06:19,850
Okay.

1584
02:06:19,870 --> 02:06:22,190

02:06:25,960 --> 02:06:27,160
Build it here.

1586
02:06:29,900 --> 02:06:30,720

What the fuck?

1591
02:06:38,800 --> 02:06:40,300
I still need to find a tire.

1592
02:06:40,900 --> 02:06:42,340
I don't know where a tire is.

1593
02:06:43,740 --> 02:06:44,700
That's good.

1594
02:06:44,900 --> 02:06:46,220
I need the ammo anyway.

1595
02:06:46,820 --> 02:06:50,000
The fun sway is ruined now.

1596
02:06:52,140 --> 02:06:54,800
Guys, I think I have more important things to worry about.

1597
02:06:54,920 --> 02:06:56,560
Okay, I think I can kill him.

1598
02:06:57,060 --> 02:06:58,480
I think I can kill the man of light.

1599
02:06:58,540 --> 02:07:00,060
I think I'm ready, guys.

1600
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:01,060
This is it.

1601
02:07:01,860 --> 02:07:03,180
This was my training arc.

1602
02:07:03,600 --> 02:07:04,440
I'm so ready.

1603
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:12,480
This is what I've been training for my entire life.

1604
02:07:13,820 --> 02:07:15,040
I can do it.

1605
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:16,720
I bet he's back there.

1606
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:19,500
He's, like, ready for the play date.

1607
02:07:21,780 --> 02:07:22,380
What the fuck?

1608
02:07:22,620 --> 02:07:23,220
Oh, my God.

1609
02:07:23,420 --> 02:07:24,400
What the fuck?

1610
02:07:25,100 --> 02:07:27,500
Okay, first off, I have to deal with these guys first.

1611
02:07:28,360 --> 02:07:28,920
Alright, nice.

1612
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:31,100

Okay, give me a sec, bro.

1614
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:33,300
Chill.

1615
02:07:33,540 --> 02:07:35,500
Like, why can't I just take the time from this car?

1616
02:07:38,300 --> 02:07:39,920
Alright, what do I have?

1617
02:07:41,540 --> 02:07:41,940
Okay.

1618
02:07:45,570 --> 02:07:47,630
Let's grab our guns for money.

1619
02:07:49,170 --> 02:07:49,710
Oh, nice.

1620
02:07:49,770 --> 02:07:51,250
Cigarettes for my mental health.

1621
02:07:53,930 --> 02:07:54,630
Okay, I bet.

1622
02:07:54,830 --> 02:07:56,030
You must be back there, right?

1623
02:07:56,950 --> 02:07:57,530
Really, right?

1624
02:07:59,350 --> 02:08:02,110
Let me use my med kit real fast.

1625
02:08:04,630 --> 02:08:06,390
I knew it.

1626
02:08:10,670 --> 02:08:10,750
Guys.

1627
02:08:17,640 --> 02:08:18,000
Oh!

1628
02:08:25,060 --> 02:08:26,480

1629
02:08:27,020 --> 02:08:29,490
I told you!

1630
02:08:29,510 --> 02:08:31,410
Could be that battle axe!

1631
02:08:31,630 --> 02:08:32,150
Oh, shit.

1632
02:08:32,230 --> 02:08:33,050
Wait, I got smoke.

1633
02:08:33,370 --> 02:08:33,530
Alright.

1634
02:08:37,410 --> 02:08:38,810
I'm ready.

1635
02:08:39,230 --> 02:08:40,050
There we go.

1636
02:08:40,170 --> 02:08:41,090
I knew it.

1637
02:08:41,350 --> 02:08:43,030
I fucking knew it.

1638
02:08:43,590 --> 02:08:44,390
I knew it.

1639
02:08:44,390 --> 02:08:45,550
I downloaded it.

1640
02:08:45,550 --> 02:08:46,030
I'm ready.

1641
02:08:46,210 --> 02:08:48,870
I got the ultimate weapon.

1642
02:08:53,630 --> 02:08:54,290
Oh, fuck.

1643
02:08:54,790 --> 02:08:55,230
Oh, my God.

1644
02:08:55,310 --> 02:08:56,750
I don't have to reload this, too.

1645
02:08:57,110 --> 02:08:58,010
Upcoming in.

1646
02:08:58,050 --> 02:08:58,470
Boom.

1647
02:09:02,250 --> 02:09:02,970
God.

1648
02:09:03,730 --> 02:09:04,690
Man of light.

1649
02:09:05,250 --> 02:09:07,390
More like man of death.

1650
02:09:11,690 --> 02:09:14,550
Brought an actual gunfight.

1651
02:09:15,230 --> 02:09:15,790
Boom!

1652
02:09:17,550 --> 02:09:19,510
I got that.

1653
02:09:20,150 --> 02:09:22,290
I am the new man.

1654
02:09:22,990 --> 02:09:25,850
I am the new world's man.

1655
02:09:26,650 --> 02:09:27,690
Get over here.

1656
02:09:27,910 --> 02:09:30,550
I got something special to show you.

1657
02:09:30,710 --> 02:09:31,210
Boom!

1658
02:09:37,990 --> 02:09:40,030
There you go.

1659
02:09:41,690 --> 02:09:42,690
What do we have?

1660
02:09:44,910 --> 02:09:45,630
There we go.

1661
02:09:46,330 --> 02:09:49,150
Now I'm definitely playing Dark Souls.

1662
02:09:50,690 --> 02:09:51,770
I'm dumping.

1663
02:09:52,270 --> 02:09:53,330
I got this.

1664
02:09:54,650 --> 02:09:56,370
Holy shit guys, I don't think I can...

1665
02:09:56,370 --> 02:09:59,870
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1666
02:10:00,430 --> 02:10:01,270
Oh!

1667
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:10,480
I didn't think you would just peek out!

1668
02:10:10,940 --> 02:10:11,360
No!

1669
02:10:11,780 --> 02:10:12,640
My son!

1670
02:10:14,860 --> 02:10:16,600
Oh my god, Broly!

1671
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:18,540
Oh my god, it's in my head!

1672
02:10:18,740 --> 02:10:20,160
Oh my god, it's over.

1673
02:10:20,740 --> 02:10:21,840
It's so over.

1674
02:10:22,580 --> 02:10:23,620
It's over for him.

1675
02:10:23,780 --> 02:10:25,480
Not for me, not for me.

1676
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:26,420
It's for him.

1677
02:10:27,660 --> 02:10:28,940
Okay, supply route.

1678
02:10:29,900 --> 02:10:30,420
Bookkeeping.

1679
02:10:31,340 --> 02:10:32,000
What did I get?

1680
02:10:32,240 --> 02:10:33,700
Oh, it's for the construction.

1681
02:10:36,180 --> 02:10:36,840
Large storage.

1682
02:10:36,900 --> 02:10:37,620
Oh, we need that.

1683
02:10:39,400 --> 02:10:41,300
Uh, storage expansion.

1684
02:10:46,180 --> 02:10:46,800
There's so many.

1685
02:10:46,820 --> 02:10:47,560
many quests.

1686
02:10:47,780 --> 02:10:51,440
Yeah, I can tell how this can be, like, super grindy.

1687
02:10:52,760 --> 02:10:54,640
How do I expand my storage?

1688
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,140
This is just... Do it automatically?

1689
02:10:57,360 --> 02:10:58,320
Oh, wait, here it is.

1690
02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:00,260
Oh!

1691
02:11:03,280 --> 02:11:05,260
Okay, I gotta pick up my items first, guys.

1692
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:09,420
Before anything else, we gotta pick up our items.

1693
02:11:12,300 --> 02:11:13,500
I claim all.

1694
02:11:14,500 --> 02:11:16,160
I don't even need a gun at this point.

1695
02:11:24,130 --> 02:11:25,430
I don't think I need a gun.

1696
02:11:25,690 --> 02:11:26,910
I have the battle axe.

1697
02:11:27,970 --> 02:11:31,590
I'm basically unstoppable until that one time I was stopped.

1698
02:11:32,010 --> 02:11:33,370
But, like, that doesn't count.

1699
02:11:35,550 --> 02:11:37,090
I'm practically unstoppable.

1700
02:11:37,850 --> 02:11:39,450
Except for that one time I was stopped.

1701
02:11:39,590 --> 02:11:41,250
But I'm practically unstoppable.

1702
02:11:44,090 --> 02:11:44,530
Alright.

1703
02:11:50,670 --> 02:11:51,110
Okay.

1704
02:11:51,290 --> 02:11:53,990

We've had her we don't we we tried we tried And that's all that matters.

1733
02:16:05,080 --> 02:16:10,880
We were so brave We were so brave

1734
02:16:14,660 --> 02:16:17,000
Bro, you are not him.

1735
02:16:19,800 --> 02:16:22,060
Return to Duck Cop.

1736
02:16:24,920 --> 02:16:26,120
Alright, let's...

1737
02:16:26,120 --> 02:16:26,780
I don't have eight...

1738
02:16:26,780 --> 02:16:28,740
I must have eight feathers now.

1739
02:16:28,940 --> 02:16:30,060
Yeah, I definitely do.

1740
02:16:32,480 --> 02:16:34,580
Because there is no way what do I get?

1741
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:35,860
I get a totem?

1742
02:16:36,380 --> 02:16:37,360
What is that?

1743
02:16:37,960 --> 02:16:39,640
Is that it?

1744
02:16:42,620 --> 02:16:43,960
Oh, I got a ninja.

1745
02:16:45,800 --> 02:16:47,820
What offer does this give me?

1746
02:16:48,320 --> 02:16:49,540
I'll save up for that.

1747
02:16:51,700 --> 02:16:53,120
Wait, equip them.

1748
02:16:53,500 --> 02:16:53,660
Oh!

1749
02:16:55,680 --> 02:16:58,880
Oh, I'm slightly reduces distance.

1750
02:16:59,540 --> 02:17:00,640
Running sound range.

1751
02:17:01,100 --> 02:17:02,740
Oh, it gives me a...

1752
02:17:02,740 --> 02:17:04,480
Oh, it's like totems.

1753
02:17:05,160 --> 02:17:05,920
I'll get more.

1754
02:17:06,400 --> 02:17:07,420
Oh, that's cool.

1755
02:17:08,620 --> 02:17:09,520
What else do I get?

1756
02:17:10,080 --> 02:17:10,500
Agus?

1757
02:17:12,320 --> 02:17:14,380
Okay, we're replacing that.

1758
02:17:14,580 --> 02:17:15,780
That seems a lot better.

1759
02:17:16,380 --> 02:17:18,560
Oh, the 80 is just 10 pull.

1760
02:17:18,780 --> 02:17:19,880
Oh, it's gotcha.

1761
02:17:21,660 --> 02:17:23,180
Oh, okay.

1762
02:17:23,720 --> 02:17:25,040
Hello, I got your shit.

1763
02:17:26,920 --> 02:17:27,880
Oh, not that.

1764
02:17:31,770 --> 02:17:33,690
Okay, I need intermediate parts.

1765
02:17:35,470 --> 02:17:36,010
Oh.

1766
02:17:39,290 --> 02:17:40,050
Oh, wait.

1767
02:17:40,170 --> 02:17:40,910
We gotta upgrade.

1768
02:17:42,010 --> 02:17:43,930
Yeah, I can tell how this can get like...

1769
02:17:43,930 --> 02:17:44,530
Because it feels...

1770
02:17:44,530 --> 02:17:46,930
It definitely feels super grindy.

1771
02:17:49,950 --> 02:17:52,630
HB3 as your first pull is streamer luck.

1772
02:17:52,850 --> 02:17:53,950
Oh, is it like it's hard?

1773
02:18:00,170 --> 02:18:00,470
Yeah?

1774
02:18:00,810 --> 02:18:03,290
Like it's supposed to be hard or something?

1775
02:18:05,190 --> 02:18:05,490
Okay.

1776
02:18:12,350 --> 02:18:14,570
Uh, what ammo does it take?

1777
02:18:14,730 --> 02:18:15,590
Rusty bullet.

1778
02:18:15,890 --> 02:18:16,990
Okay, we don't need that then.

1779
02:18:23,290 --> 02:18:24,790
Let's put all of this away.

1780
02:18:27,530 --> 02:18:28,890
I will do one more run.

1781
02:18:30,710 --> 02:18:32,130
Gotta go to sleep, though.

1782
02:18:39,540 --> 02:18:39,820
Alright.

1783
02:18:42,720 --> 02:18:45,620
Is this, like, early access-ish, right?

1784
02:18:45,660 --> 02:18:47,640
Or is it, like, fully- I feel like...

1785
02:18:47,640 --> 02:18:48,920
I don't know, actually.

1786
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:51,040
I don't know if this is supposed to be fully completed.

1787
02:18:51,640 --> 02:18:53,600
But, um, I hope they add more stuff.

1788
02:18:53,620 --> 02:19:20,500

1799
02:20:53,090 --> 02:20:53,730
That's not a...

02:20:53,730 --> 02:20:55,690
That's not a duck!

1801
02:20:59,550 --> 02:21:01,030
Alright, so...

1802
02:21:01,130 --> 02:21:03,130
I'm gonna hit the bed.

1803
02:21:06,430 --> 02:21:16,270
Alright, so now that we know not to head out at night time, what did we learn today, class?

1804
02:21:17,690 --> 02:21:19,770
What did I throw?

1805
02:21:20,550 --> 02:21:22,750
It was a fucking droid!

1806
02:21:26,500 --> 02:21:28,340
Alright, let's go.

1807
02:21:28,620 --> 02:21:29,720
Yeah, I think I...

1808
02:21:29,720 --> 02:21:32,040
Yeah, I don't think nighttime was it, guys.

1809
02:21:32,760 --> 02:21:37,180
I had a Oh my god, that's nearly a tire Why can't I bring this one home?

1810
02:21:38,060 --> 02:21:39,900
No, now?

1811
02:21:40,160 --> 02:21:41,900
Because I was like, what the fuck was that sound?

1812
02:21:42,820 --> 02:21:45,760
That sounded very Not duck-like

1813
02:21:48,800 --> 02:21:54,080
That didn't For some reason, that didn't sound like a duck What could that be?

1814
02:21:59,240 --> 02:22:06,780
Wham, whamam Wham I missed, but it doesn't matter because he was like, you missed.

1815
02:22:07,240 --> 02:22:11,300
I like how the duck was like, wait, I didn't expect you to miss.

1816
02:22:11,400 --> 02:22:12,700
I didn't have a plan B.

1817
02:22:16,960 --> 02:22:17,400
Boom.

1818
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:21,060
Gee, thank you for the super chat.

1819
02:22:21,460 --> 02:22:22,300
Thank you.

1820
02:22:25,420 --> 02:22:26,360
Whack, whack.

1821
02:22:27,960 --> 02:22:29,960
Alright, this will be my last run.

1822
02:22:32,260 --> 02:22:32,280
Oh.

1823
02:22:33,280 --> 02:22:34,540
Gotta loot this guy.

1824
02:22:35,200 --> 02:22:37,420
I'm gonna take his gun so I can sell it.

1825
02:22:42,740 --> 02:22:44,280
It's so strong.

1826
02:22:44,540 --> 02:22:49,060
It's so stupid that the axe is the strongest weapon right now.

1827
02:22:50,160 --> 02:22:51,600
In the first zone.

1828
02:22:53,620 --> 02:22:55,100
Oh yeah, no, it's so satisfying.

1829
02:22:57,180 --> 02:22:58,860
Let's see, where the fuck do I go?

1830
02:22:59,020 --> 02:23:00,180
How do I unlock the other?

1831
02:23:00,200 --> 02:23:02,780
Do I just go to North Mountain and it locks it?

1832
02:23:04,260 --> 02:23:06,000
I'm still trying to find a tire.

1833
02:23:12,090 --> 02:23:12,970
Just like...

1834
02:23:12,970 --> 02:23:14,310
Okay, I'm gonna go this way.

1835
02:23:14,730 --> 02:23:14,990
Oh.

1836
02:23:15,890 --> 02:23:17,670
There's some fighting going on.

1837
02:23:17,750 --> 02:23:18,470
Who is he fighting?

1838
02:23:19,110 --> 02:23:20,390
Oh, he's fighting a dog.

1839
02:23:20,530 --> 02:23:20,890
Oh, wait.

1840
02:23:21,030 --> 02:23:22,130
He lost to the dog.

1841
02:23:24,130 --> 02:23:26,270
He was fighting the dog.

1842
02:23:27,010 --> 02:23:28,010
Oh, I remember.

1843
02:23:28,110 --> 02:23:30,790
I couldn't go past it because there was a wall.

1844
02:23:31,270 --> 02:23:32,510
They literally put a wall.

1845
02:23:33,750 --> 02:23:34,390
There we go.

1846
02:23:39,450 --> 02:23:40,390
Oh my god, that's good.

1847
02:23:40,450 --> 02:23:41,610
We got the crafting material.

1848
02:23:42,550 --> 02:23:44,190
Yeah, how the fuck do I get past this wall?

1849
02:23:46,370 --> 02:24:15,210
That's why That's why I'm stuck in the zone You sure I've rolled Ducks can rolled Clanker is cat It's thinking of the super chat thing Oh the dynamite I have a dynamite It's in my warehouse I do have it Oh Get over here You made a mistake There you Oh He's like,

02:24:17,030 --> 02:24:19,670
You try to reload in front of me.

1852
02:24:20,650 --> 02:24:22,530
It's death time.

1853
02:24:23,490 --> 02:24:25,010
Oh, I never got in this way before.

1854
02:24:27,990 --> 02:24:31,470
Surprising with how small this area is, there's a lot of places I haven't gone.

1855
02:24:33,110 --> 02:24:35,530
I have one more inventory slot left.

1856
02:24:36,930 --> 02:24:39,290
That should be an important item to get.

1857
02:24:45,490 --> 02:24:46,730
All right, never mind.

1858
02:24:46,990 --> 02:24:48,390
All right, I think.

1859
02:24:48,950 --> 02:24:50,470
I think we can head home.

1860
02:24:50,750 --> 02:24:53,750
I mean, I got one crafting material, but yeah.

1861
02:24:54,070 --> 02:24:55,170
I think that's all right.

1862
02:25:00,550 --> 02:25:03,310
I'm definitely, like, not exploring efficiently.

1863
02:25:03,510 --> 02:25:04,290
I can feel it.

1864
02:25:04,870 --> 02:25:06,570
I feel like, oh, wait, battery.

1865
02:25:06,990 --> 02:25:08,490
Wait, I haven't seen a battery before.

1866
02:25:09,750 --> 02:25:10,830
Um, we'll put this.

1867
02:25:11,210 --> 02:25:13,050
We'll put this away.

1868
02:25:14,010 --> 02:25:14,510
I don't know.

1869
02:25:14,630 --> 02:25:16,170
I feel like, wait, he's red.

1870
02:25:16,790 --> 02:25:17,610
Oh, sh!

1871
02:25:19,670 --> 02:25:20,190

1873
02:25:21,910 --> 02:25:23,170

1884
02:26:30,760 --> 02:26:32,660
We actually have to leave.

1885
02:26:32,920 --> 02:26:34,040
Okay, we finished the request.

1886
02:26:34,700 --> 02:26:34,960
Yay!

1887
02:26:36,740 --> 02:26:37,500
You got a shortcut.

02:26:39,220 --> 02:26:40,040
Oh, my God.

1889
02:26:40,200 --> 02:26:40,320
Okay.

1890
02:26:40,660 --> 02:26:41,880
That was a strong-ass door.

1891
02:26:43,280 --> 02:26:43,500
What?

1892
02:26:45,500 --> 02:26:46,440

Okay.

1895
02:26:52,240 --> 02:26:54,440
I don't expect him to just fucking show up.

1896
02:26:57,860 --> 02:26:59,020
All right, let's go home.

1897
02:27:02,770 --> 02:27:05,930
I have so much ammo that I can just spray and pray.

1898
02:27:10,880 --> 02:27:11,360
Alright.

1899
02:27:12,060 --> 02:27:12,840
Yay, shortcut.

1900
02:27:14,580 --> 02:27:16,380
Got my axe ready.

1901
02:27:16,760 --> 02:27:17,160
What?

1902
02:27:19,240 --> 02:27:19,720
Whatchu.

1903
02:27:20,160 --> 02:27:20,640
Whatchu.

1904
02:27:22,040 --> 02:27:22,400
Alright.

02:27:23,560 --> 02:27:24,760
Oh yeah, I could.

1906
02:27:24,960 --> 02:27:25,320
It's alright.

1907
02:27:25,380 --> 02:27:25,900
We don't need it.

1908
02:27:25,960 --> 02:27:27,260
I wasn't going to give my dog cigarettes.

1909
02:27:27,940 --> 02:27:30,120
I feel like maybe I shouldn't.

1910
02:27:32,720 --> 02:27:34,540
I was going to give dad my cigarettes.

1911
02:27:34,560 --> 02:27:35,060
cigarettes.

1912
02:27:35,620 --> 02:27:36,600
I don't want him to know.

1913
02:27:41,810 --> 02:27:43,770
I think that was a good last run.

1914
02:27:49,590 --> 02:27:50,790
I got that.

1915
02:27:50,910 --> 02:27:52,950
And we also got the butcher knife too.

1916
02:27:54,290 --> 02:27:55,690
Span it pockets.

1917
02:27:56,070 --> 02:27:57,830
Use the skill enhancer.

1918
02:27:57,930 --> 02:27:59,070
Didn't I already do that?

1919
02:28:00,090 --> 02:28:01,090
Yeah, I was gonna say.

1920
02:28:01,990 --> 02:28:04,310
That's like one of the first things full of love.

1921
02:28:06,650 --> 02:28:07,830
Yeah, I have a lot of money.

1922
02:28:07,850 --> 02:28:08,690
for that.

1923
02:28:13,210 --> 02:28:14,830
Kill any enemy.

1924
02:28:15,270 --> 02:28:16,050
Headshots required.

1925
02:28:16,250 --> 02:28:17,230
Bro, it's top down.

1926
02:28:17,450 --> 02:28:18,050
How the fuck?

1927
02:28:20,330 --> 02:28:24,730
How do I, like, even, like, isn't that already, like, a given?

1928
02:28:24,870 --> 02:28:25,990
Oh, nice, medic station.

1929
02:28:26,630 --> 02:28:27,990
Wait, we need that, actually.

1930
02:28:29,690 --> 02:28:30,470
Put it here.

1931
02:28:32,170 --> 02:28:33,970
Oh, nice, we have medic station now.

1932
02:28:34,250 --> 02:28:34,770

1933
02:28:36,270 --> 02:28:36,790
Okay.

1934
02:28:37,850 --> 02:28:38,870
Alright, little supplies.

1935
02:28:39,330 --> 02:28:40,410
General medicine.

1936
02:28:41,310 --> 02:28:44,550
I feel like I have a lot of first aid kits, yeah.

1937
02:28:45,770 --> 02:28:46,610
That's good.

1938
02:28:47,530 --> 02:28:49,350
Yeah, do I just aim at them?

1939
02:28:49,430 --> 02:28:51,190
I was, like, thinking, like, isn't that a given?

1940
02:28:52,970 --> 02:28:54,130
I got a pen.

1941
02:28:55,730 --> 02:28:56,210
Alright.

1942
02:28:56,490 --> 02:28:57,870
What do I just give me?

1943
02:28:58,730 --> 02:28:59,390
Oh, wait!

1944
02:28:59,450 --> 02:29:00,370
I can finally...

1945
02:29:00,370 --> 02:29:00,990
Oh, my God.

1946
02:29:01,070 --> 02:29:02,190
I can finally do it.

1947
02:29:03,430 --> 02:29:05,690
Wait, how do I...

1948
02:29:08,380 --> 02:29:08,900
What?

1949
02:29:11,020 --> 02:29:13,820
I have blueprints Hello?

1950
02:29:20,320 --> 02:29:21,260
How come it doesn't?

1951
02:29:21,620 --> 02:29:24,480
Oh, wait, what the fuck is the?

1952
02:29:25,140 --> 02:29:26,160
Is it only for medicine?

1953
02:29:27,980 --> 02:29:30,440
Oh, it's for medicine blueprints.

1954
02:29:31,080 --> 02:29:32,260
Oh, okay.

1955
02:29:32,460 --> 02:29:33,560
Okay, I get it.

1956
02:29:33,880 --> 02:29:34,740
I was so confused.

1957
02:29:35,020 --> 02:29:36,040
I was like, huh?

1958
02:29:36,600 --> 02:29:38,100
I have blueprints right here.

1959
02:29:38,180 --> 02:29:39,460
Why won't you take it?

1960
02:29:41,540 --> 02:29:44,720
Oh, oh my god, I could have done this this entire time.

1961
02:29:46,380 --> 02:29:47,600
I didn't even realize.

1962
02:29:49,500 --> 02:29:52,160
And that is already registered.

1963
02:29:52,420 --> 02:29:53,600
Okay, I can sell that.

1964
02:29:56,140 --> 02:29:57,460
I can sell that.

1965
02:29:57,860 --> 02:29:58,680
I can sell that.

1966
02:30:01,840 --> 02:30:04,220
I can finally sell some of my blueprints.

1967
02:30:05,280 --> 02:30:07,260
Oh my I can not... Oh, where is it that?

1968
02:30:07,960 --> 02:30:08,480
Nice.

1969
02:30:10,140 --> 02:30:42,680
I try to make weapons and now... Where else am I supposed to do it i don't understand this is an emergency is it not okay let's craft this oh this is like so deep there's like so much stuff you can do here wait actually we need that repair station there's is actually so like a lot more complicated and expected we're like i feel like they made this as a joke,

1970
02:30:42,780 --> 02:30:44,880
and the people were like, wait a minute, this is pretty good.

1971
02:30:49,780 --> 02:30:53,880
And they're like, wait a minute, wait, we got some, wait, we're cooking right now.

1972
02:30:54,860 --> 02:30:56,160
I have a lot of glutes.

1973
02:30:58,060 --> 02:31:03,040
This feels like it was made as a joke, but then they were like, oh, wait, wait, I think we got something.

1974
02:31:11,390 --> 02:31:14,470
I like how my storage is just jazz.

1975
02:31:15,350 --> 02:31:16,610
Alright, we gotta call it here.

1976
02:31:16,690 --> 02:32:20,830
I feel like I could, I definitely can see how this game was is super addicting and how it sold a million copies because of how much you can do in this game because like i feel like i've only just scratched the surface of what escape from duck cough has to offer but and like this is my first time playing like uh like i've never played dark off before but i can understand like the grind of this game yeah yeah especially though and there's no hackers around you know and you don't have to be like super fucking paranoid about a sniper 500 miles away from you like i think i definitely the only issue is like i don't know where items spawn i think that's like my only issue so like i i feel like i'm collecting a lot of junk because i don't know where to loot like yeah yeah no i've been i was like checking this game out and i saw like it's very popular nation i saw like a lot of people were streaming it um in like especially in japan i saw a lot of like japanese streamers uh playing escape from

1977
02:32:20,830 --> 02:32:52,910
duck off and um i could see like why like because this gives like because like like you know it gives the tarcoff itch and stuff um um but yeah for this this sold a million copies so i was like really curious about it and i saw that um i saw that like you know like i was i was looking at steam i was like what like i thought it was just a joke game but then like everyone was like this is the best extraction shooter ever made and i was like That's a crazy statement because a lot of extraction shooters have been made.

1978
02:32:53,250 --> 02:32:59,110
I don't know if you guys know that, but there was a lot of extraction shooters.

1979
02:33:06,270 --> 02:33:09,230
So I was like very curious.

1980
02:33:10,290 --> 02:33:13,310

It was really nice exploring, escape from Duck Calf.

1983
02:33:21,730 --> 02:33:23,390
I had fun time checking it out.

1984
02:33:23,670 --> 02:33:25,290
I don't know if I'll stream more of it.

1985
02:33:25,590 --> 02:33:27,810
I feel like it's a game I definitely might play off stream.

1986
02:33:28,210 --> 02:33:30,390
But I don't know if I'll stream more of it on stream.

1987
02:33:30,610 --> 02:33:32,950
Because I feel like it's just more like a grindy thing.

1988
02:33:33,090 --> 02:33:37,970
If I'm like bored, I just be like, alright, time to go in and go swish swish.

1989
02:33:38,650 --> 02:33:40,490
But I hope you guys have fun watching.
