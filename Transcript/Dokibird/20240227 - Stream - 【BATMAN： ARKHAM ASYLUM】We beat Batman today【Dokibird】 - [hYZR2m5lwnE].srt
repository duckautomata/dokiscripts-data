1
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:53,390
Everybody!

2
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,330
Hey guys!

3
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,590
Oh my gosh!

4
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,130
Okay.

5
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:57,710
I...

6
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:00,730
Whoa!

7
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:01,370
Batman!

8
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:02,970
Today's the day!

9
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,090
We will be finishing Batman!

10
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,090
Finally!

11
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:13,970
Also guys, I don't know if you guys noticed this, but do I look a little different to you all?

12
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:24,590
So for those who don't know, I have a... I was raised by a single parent.

13
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:25,570
I.e.

14
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:29,090
I only have one... Okay, not for real single...

15
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,770
I meant like...

16
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,410
This skin suit... Okay, I have a mom and a dad.

17
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:41,610
But for this skin suit, I only have one mama.

18
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,810
I don't have a...

19
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:43,790
I don't have a...

20
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:44,410
I don't have a papa.

21
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,750
Because my mama is my papa.

22
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:47,610
So...

23
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,370
I was...

24
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,890
This skin suit...

25
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,990
My mama is my papa.

26
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,270
So...

27
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,610
Yesterday...

28
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,070
Yesterday, my mama papa...

29
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:09,730
Did a little bit of some refurbishing for my skin suit.

30
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,790
Because my skin suit was very, very old.

31
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,870
So now...

32
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,410
Now, if you guys follow me on Twitter, you might have noticed I...

33
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,290
I posted a little picture on the Twitter.

34
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,050
Because, I can do this now.

35
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,300
I can do this now.

36
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,700
It's so good.

37
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,060
Do it again, Tokia!

38
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,620
Oh my god, do it again!

39
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,160
So yeah, I can also do this, but it's not as cool as the other thing.

40
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,160
It's not as cool though, it's not as cool to be fair.

41
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,480
This is the coolest part.

42
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,760
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

43
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,040
Thank you, thank you.

44
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,540
She's perfect.

45
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:21,060
But yes, the skin suit got a little bit of an upgrade.

46
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:32,540
We put in the washing machine too, cleaned it up a little bit, gave it a little bit... it's not as like, you know, it's not as old.

47
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,420
Well, it's still old, but like, it's not as bad as before.

48
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:42,520
You know like when you get like, when you go to like the Apple store and then you like buy a refurbished iPhone.

49
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,180
That's basically me.

50
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,540
That's me right now.

51
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,820
I'm just a refurbished used iPhone at the moment.

52
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,940
Don't worry.

53
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,080
Other news!

54
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,720
Other news!

55
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,560
I got my play button today!

56
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,100
I got it today!

57
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:05,020
I still can't believe I named it Doki Bird FPS VTuber TTV Facebook YouTube.

58
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,100
I can't believe!

59
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,000
You can name... Did you guys know you can name your play button anything?

60
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,860
And I was like, there's no way.

61
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:18,800
There's no way they would let me name my play button Doki Bird FPS VTuber.

62
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,800
Because VTuber TTV YouTube Facebook.

63
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,960
Like you know like I saw it.

64
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,420
It was there.

65
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,600
It was actually there.

66
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,900
And I was like, holy shit.

67
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,260
There is a way.

68
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,500
A fucking course.

69
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,800
My only play button that I own.

70
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,520
And I had to name it the most fucking dumbass name I could put on there.

71
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,820
Also, another... There's so many updates.

72
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,660
Oh my gosh.

73
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,320
There's so many updates I have to give you guys.

74
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:57,260
But I was talking to like for those who aren't into like the Apex community stuff.

75
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,340
For those who don't know who Nicewig is.

76
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,180
Nicewig is like one of the main...

77
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,920
One of the casters for like...

78
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,560
Apex Legends.

79
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,260
He's like a really well known content creator in Apex.

80
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,940
And he actually did like casting for like the Japan's like Apex Festival.

81
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,460
Like in Japan like last week.

82
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,320
But...

83
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,900
Nicewig and Tempo.

84
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,940
Tempo who is like the manager for TSM.

85
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,340
He's like the manager for TSM.

86
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,260
And also organizes all the Apex Legends scrims.

87
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,860
In the pro community.

88
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,440
Anyway.

89
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,520
Tempo and...

90
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:43,080
Wig convinced me to sign up for the Challenger Circuit for ALGS.

91
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,760
So...

92
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:51,420
The besties are gonna be competing in ALGS Challenger Circuit.

93
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,200
I think like next week.

94
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,200
I don't know which one we're joining.

95
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,160
But they were like, Doki are you down for it?

96
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:58,860
And I was like, you know what?

97
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,400
Fuck it.

98
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,420
I don't... like we might get knocked out in the first round.

99
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,260
But...

100
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:03,860
Fuck it.

101
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,520
Let's do it.

102
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,240
So I'm gonna be doing...

103
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,400
I'm gonna be doing the Challenger Circuit with Nicewig and Tempo.

104
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,220
Like Tempo was like...

105
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,980
Doki no.

106
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,420
We can make it to the semi-finals.

107
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,300
I was like...

108
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:17,920
Okay.

109
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,720
I was just like... Tempo.

110
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,280
We're gonna be IGL'd by Wig.

111
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,200
None of us scrim.

112
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,600
Scrims is not considered scrimming.

113
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,560
I have been busy trying to speedrun.

114
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,980
Restarting my career right now.

115
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,520
I don't know what you mean.

116
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,940
If you think that we're gonna make it.

117
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,020
To the semi-finals.

118
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,220
I don't know what you're talking about.

119
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,360
It'll be fun.

120
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,560
It's gonna be fun.

121
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:57,620
But I do not think we're gonna make it all the way to the semi-finals.

122
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,220
Um...

123
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,520
Anyway.

124
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,140
I think it's either next week or the week after that.

125
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,820
We're just gonna see what Wig's schedule is gonna be like.

126
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,620
Because it's all dependent on him.

127
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,380
Since he's the busy one out of the three of us.

128
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,520
Um...

129
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,980
I was also invited to the Apex Invitationals.

130
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,120
For those who don't know.

131
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,240
There is a...

132
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,980
They just recently announced the Nessie Cup Invitationals.

133
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,060
In NA.

134
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,380
And they are going to be the most popular.

135
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,460
And I was invited to participate.

136
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,580
In at least one of them.

137
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,440
Because...

138
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,720
Well to be fair.

139
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,240
It's more so I was like, Tempo can I join?

140
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,120
And he's like, yeah.

141
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,440
So like...

142
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,660
That was basically how it went.

143
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,780
Because I was like, oh hey.

144
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,300
I just saw this.

145
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,020
Can I join?

146
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:53,780
Yeah you can.

147
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,500
I was like, sweet.

148
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:58,960
So...

149
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,140
So I'm going to be there too.

150
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:05,560
Um...

151
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,100
For the...

152
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:06,880
Hey and it's...

153
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,340
I don't even know if I'm going to win any money.

154
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,920
But it was like $25,000 or something.

155
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:11,920
I don't know.

156
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,460
It was like, wait let me see where I could find the...

157
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,360
Um...

158
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,520
Let me see if I could find like the details of it.

159
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,160
It was like something...

160
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,400
I just saw it pop up on my Twitter.

161
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,600
And I was like, can I join?

162
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,620
Yeah you can.

163
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:24,860
Cool.

164
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,760
Yeah.

165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,560
Alright.

166
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,060
Apex Legends.

167
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,160
Nessie Cup.

168
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,140
Oh yeah, yeah.

169
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,660
It's 25... what is it?

170
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,440
Holy shit.

171
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:34,760
Okay.

172
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,000
Each event...

173
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,280
Wait!

174
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,660
It's 50,000!

175
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,740
Holy fuck!

176
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,220
Okay.

177
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,380
Apparently each event is $50,000 prize pool.

178
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,120
Yeah!

179
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,920
It's like mini games too.

180
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,980
Which is the best part?

181
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,440
It's like... and there's like three of them.

182
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,380
So I asked if I could join like...

183
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,160
at least one of them.

184
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:55,620
So...

185
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,160
I wanted to do the mini games one.

186
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,560
Because like there's hide and seek and stuff like that.

187
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,280
And like fisting.

188
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,720
Like punching people out.

189
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,400
And I was like...

190
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,280
I'd rather do the ones where I can like not actually shoot my gun.

191
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,960
And that's fine with me.

192
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,780
Because there's like...

193
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,960
three different invitationals.

194
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:22,580
The second one is like where you actually have to shoot your gun and play as a team.

195
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:28,300
But the first invitational and the third invitational is like you get to fuck around and you can...

196
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,240
you don't have to like actually shoot your gun.

197
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,580
So I was like I would like to be in either of those for that sweet 50k.

198
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,380
Like not having to shoot my gun?

199
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,800
Sign me up.

200
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,920
So yeah.

201
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,240
So those are like the apex updates.

202
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,020
For uh...

203
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,940
For like...

204
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,320
When is the first one again?

205
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,460
That one is on March 7th.

206
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,300
So I might be on the March 7th one.

207
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:01,960
I'm not sure yet.

208
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,160
I'm just waiting for...

209
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:08,360
I'm just waiting for like to know which one I'm gonna be in.

210
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,660
But there's gonna be...

211
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,600
No it's a 50k prize pool.

212
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,700
Of course it's not per person.

213
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,420
What the fuck?

214
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:23,260
I feel like that if it was per person like I feel like that money would be used instead to improve Apex more.

215
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:27,960
I do not think that they would be willing to give 50k per person in a random tournament.

216
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,220
I'd rather have that money be used in Apex Legends in general and just improve the game.

217
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,480
Also!

218
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,200
LilPastaBoy thank you for the super chat.

219
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:38,520
Thank you.

220
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,060
Thank you.

221
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:39,960
Oh boy.

222
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,260
I sure am excited for the Facebook streams.

223
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,140
I mean it says so in your play button.

224
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,400
No one lies on the internet.

225
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,040
Of course not.

226
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:46,880
Don't worry.

227
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,320
I never said when I'll be streaming on Facebook.

228
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,020
I never said when.

229
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,180
Guess you just gotta wait until it happens.

230
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,250
Guess you just gotta wait until it happens.

231
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:01,590
Guess you just gotta wait until it happens.

232
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:02,470
But yeah.

233
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,150
Lots of fun little updates for all of us.

234
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,090
I know I wrote down some stuff too.

235
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,670
I was like working the entire day.

236
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:09,370
Holy shit.

237
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,090
Oh my god.

238
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,110
It was a lot of work today.

239
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,410
But yes!

240
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,050
Anyway let's actually finish Batman!

241
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,270
I swear.

242
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:20,530
Okay.

243
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,330
How many times do you guys think I said Batman?

244
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,290
I think I'm gonna crash guys.

245
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,230
What?

246
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:26,090
Guys.

247
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,550
Please I just wanna finish Batman.

248
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,410
That's all I want.

249
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,750
Let me finish Batman!

250
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:35,970
I love.

251
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,450
I love I can do this now.

252
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,490
Alright here we go.

253
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:58,750
What?

254
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,930
You don't even have a dec...

255
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:02,250
I'm gonna go to bed.

256
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,510
And then the doctor.

257
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,070
Slept fine ever since.

258
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:12,110
Joker what is up with you and like breaking people's legs Joker?

259
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,350
Like at this point I think it's like a fetish thing.

260
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,370
You're always breaking people's legs.

261
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,190
Broke it.

262
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,210
Thank you for the super chat.

263
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:22,530
Thank you.

264
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,710
Hi Doki.

265
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,470
It's my birthday today and I'm glad I was able to catch your streams.

266
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,850
Been watching your VODs for around two years.

267
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,750
And first recently started to watch you live.

268
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:31,910
I always enjoy watching your streams.

269
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:32,610
Enjoy your content.

270
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:33,610
Thank you for the super chat.

271
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,050
Thank you.

272
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,890
Happy birthday to you.

273
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:41,570
Happy birthday dear Broku.

274
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,330
Happy birthday to you.

275
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:45,090
Alright time to fist this plant.

276
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,830
Oh shit!

277
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:49,770
Get away.

278
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,610
How the fuck?

279
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:53,950
Get away!

280
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:55,710
Alright.

281
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:57,490
Goodbye.

282
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,210
There's no cameras.

283
00:14:59,250 --> 00:14:59,810
No witnesses.

284
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,230
I have to go all the way there?

285
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:04,690
Can I?

286
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:05,170
Okay.

287
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,290
Alright that's fine.

288
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:06,910
I can get there.

289
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:08,950
Okay.

290
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,610
I gotta make sure.

291
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,710
Oh wait teeth!

292
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:13,650
Where's the teeth?

293
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,110
I hear teeth!

294
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,010
Oh teeth!

295
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,070
Nice.

296
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,050
Alright here we go.

297
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,040
I don't...

298
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,460
I think like...

299
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:26,680
What?

300
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:26,980
What?

301
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:27,820
Door's locked.

302
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,300
Is there another way?

303
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,700
Okay thank god there's another way here.

304
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,740
I was gonna be like No please don't make me go the long way.

305
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,340
Please.

306
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,680
Is it supposed to be right outside?

307
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,140
What do you think you can do Batman?

308
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,720
I am everywhere.

309
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,060
My babies know your every move.

310
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,940
I'm gonna be so sad if she's not school.

311
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,620
Ow!

312
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,860
You and your car are arrogant enough to think you can destroy us.

313
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,320
Ow!

314
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,080
You will fail.

315
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,320
And we...

316
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,440
We will become the most powerful force on the planet.

317
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:00,680
We will become the most powerful force on the planet.

318
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,640
Who's we?

319
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,500
You think the Joker gives a fuck about you Ivy?

320
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,560
He's always a solo act.

321
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,160
He barely gives a fuck about Harley.

322
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,760
He's always like selling Harley off to the next guy.

323
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,140
You think you're gonna be different Ivy?

324
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,180
You're just delaying the inevitable.

325
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,540
I can fix her.

326
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,320
Oh she's talking about her and the plants.

327
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,760
Oh that makes more sense.

328
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,460
Yeah it's gonna be like who the fuck is we?

329
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,480
Gotta make sure I fist every plant around me.

330
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,460
The other sniper.

331
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,600
If I don't look at the other sniper he doesn't exist.

332
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,820
If you don't acknowledge the problem it'll eventually go away.

333
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,220
Right?

334
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:54,800
Oh shit.

335
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,720
What if they're into fisting?

336
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,260
What's going on about the plants of hers?

337
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:07,700
When I finish with Batman I'll be coming after you Joker.

338
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,940
Will you really?

339
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,780
Oh that's gratitude isn't it?

340
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,600
Fuck women.

341
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,140
You give them presents, experimental...

342
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,060
Whoa!

343
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:18,660
Whoa!

344
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,220
Joker!

345
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:24,940
Ow.

346
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,140
Who the fuck shot... who's shooting me?

347
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:28,920
Oh above.

348
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,580
Come find me when you're done with Batman.

349
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,320
Oh little bit faster.

350
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,340
No no no no no no no no no!

351
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,700
I'll take this.

352
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:35,860
Whoa

353
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,530
Joker!

354
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,290
Whoa ow!

355
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,650
Who the hell!

356
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:49,170
I salute my fallen enemy!

357
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,510
Oh my god.

358
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,770
How the fuck was I supposed to know?

359
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:54,250
No!

360
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:54,890
Okay.

361
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,850
At least I get to fist these plants again.

362
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:01,690
You will pay Batman for hurting my babies.

363
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:03,850
Of course.

364
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,390
Does she have a going on about those plants of hers?

365
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:11,830
When I finish with Batman I'll be coming after you Joker.

366
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:12,910
There's no waiting.

367
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,110
Will you really?

368
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,750
I can't grapple.

369
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,430
There's too many people talking.

370
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:23,410
Presents, experimental chemicals, and nice costumes and they still turn on you.

371
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,190
I... I still hit him.

372
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,350
It's gonna be like I missed.

373
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:35,890
Ow!

374
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:37,710
Where?

375
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:39,370
Where?

376
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:39,630
No!

377
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,030
If I keep running you can't catch me!

378
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,510
I'll just keep dodging.

379
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,010
I'll just keep dodging.

380
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,190
I have no stamina.

381
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,690
It's 2010!

382
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:48,410
Ow.

383
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:49,970
It's okay.

384
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:50,990
We can hack this.

385
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:53,970
Alright.

386
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:55,730
It's 2010.

387
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,250
There's no stamina in this game.

388
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,010
I can dodge forever.

389
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,550
How the fuck do I?

390
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,870
I need to remember how to hack.

391
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,170
I need to remember how to hack again.

392
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:06,570
Please.

393
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:08,890
Please!

394
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,370
Where's the green?

395
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:13,650
Where's the green?

396
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,230
Oh, there it is.

397
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:15,950
I really don't want...

398
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,490
I'm too lazy to walk around.

399
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:18,290
I...

400
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:21,330
Ooh!

401
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:22,710
Interview tape.

402
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,400
No!

403
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,020
Don't make him trauma dumb!

404
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,880
You're gonna fall in love!

405
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,020
No!

406
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,660
No!

407
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:21,360
Don't you remember what happened to Harley the moment he starts trauma dumping?

408
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,160
It's over!

409
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,160
It's so fucking over!

410
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,640
I wonder if there's anything at the...

411
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,180
Ooh, can I scan this?

412
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,140
No, I can't scan this thing.

413
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,840
I thought there'd be something here.

414
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,260
Wait, how do I get inside here?

415
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,860
You're gonna...

416
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,140
You're gonna be like, I can fix him!

417
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,160
And it'll be over!

418
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,080
It'll be over for you!

419
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,600
Thank you for the super chat.

420
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,700
Thank you, thank you.

421
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,280
So that's how it works.

422
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,360
Redpixel, thank you for the super chat.

423
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,220
Thank you, thank you.

424
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,000
Hi Doki, congrats on the play button.

425
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:03,720
I wonder if it's possible that the name take up the entire width of the plaque for the next one.

426
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,560
I don't know.

427
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:08,940
If I ever get a million, I'm just like thinking if I should like...

428
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:13,500
If I should add more to it or just do Doki Bird.

429
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:20,660
I was like, do I... I mean the best thing about it is that you can technically you can buy like unlimited play buttons.

430
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,280
It's like around like a hundred... I don't remember it was like a hundred... it was like...

431
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,320
I remember I asked about it before.

432
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:31,040
It was like two hundred dollars, I think.

433
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,880
You can buy like unlimited play buttons.

434
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:42,920
So it's not like they... they send you the first one for free and then they... and then the rest you can pay for extra copies.

435
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,800
So I'm just like... do I actually get a real one?

436
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,300
Or do I keep... do I keep adding more to it?

437
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,260
Let's see...

438
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,780
It's me.

439
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,720
I mean...

440
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,060
I mean...

441
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,620
Good for you for the photosynthesis.

442
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,280
I mean we need more trees for oxygen.

443
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,160
So like good on you Ivy.

444
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,880
Good on you.

445
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,200
Oh hey.

446
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,680
I need that actually.

447
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,920
We were the ones to fix this city.

448
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,680
And the city would thank us.

449
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,140
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

450
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:43,900
Thank you, thank you.

451
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:50,000
So you're saying if we super chat you two hundred dollars, we can request a new play button for your collection?

452
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,220
Um...

453
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,760
In theory, yes.

454
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,160
In theory.

455
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:04,040
I can... if you... if you like, you know, super chat me.

456
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,240
Two hundred dollars.

457
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,560
In theory, I could order a play button.

458
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,640
If I wanted to.

459
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:19,840
I could technically just decorate an entire wall with just like silver play buttons that you've like sent me money to buy for.

460
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,020
In theory, yes.

461
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,280
Chat personalized play button.

462
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:36,960
Cause the thing is, the reason why they do this is cause like if your channel is owned by like multiple people, so you can like buy more play buttons for the rest of the people in your like YouTube team.

463
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:57,720
So in theory, I could be like you guys are part of my team and I just buy like an X amount of play buttons and just name it, just name it in with whatever suggestions you give me and just order like, I don't know, like twenty of them of different fucking names.

464
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,600
Yes, in theory, we could do this.

465
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,740
But the best thing about this is that this is all theoretical.

466
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,340
Stephen, towards the play button.

467
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,100
Thank you for the super chat.

468
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:12,500
Thank you.

469
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:13,740
Yes,

470
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,140
this is all theoretical, guys.

471
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,480
It is possible.

472
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,020
Cosmic, thank you for the super chat.

473
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,500
Thank you.

474
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,000
Thank you.

475
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,720
Well, you know what to do, boys.

476
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,160
Play buttons, don't go.

477
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,320
Thank you for the super chat still.

478
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,120
Thank you.

479
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,980
Thank you.

480
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,520
And that's a play button theory.

481
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,860
Not gonna lie, I'm pretty sure the what was it called?

482
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:51,760
The game theory channel is gonna die the moment he like the moment he uh the moment he like leaves the channel for good.

483
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,180
Thank you for the Aka Aka Supa play button.

484
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,040
It's fun.

485
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,320
Iridescent, thank you for the Aka Supa.

486
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:01,720
Thank you.

487
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,100
Thank you.

488
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,540
I'm all for the theoretical play.

489
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,560
Okay, how about this?

490
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,520
You guys want me to do?

491
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:07,940
Okay.

492
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:21,720
Alright, I'll let you guys name I'll buy, I'll purchase an extra play button and I'll let you, I like how I'm saying all this while like I'm slowly killing Ivy and she's like crying about nature and I'm like play button.

493
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,280
Let's talk about play buttons.

494
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,580
Anyway, um I'll let you guys name one play button.

495
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,040
Are you ready for me?

496
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,200
Do you think you can handle me?

497
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,060
I don't know if I wanna buy like 20 play buttons.

498
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,120
Whoa!

499
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,240
I'm waiting in here.

500
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,780
Come to me.

501
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,040
Whoa!

502
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,140
Whoa!

503
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:54,120
Trying to promise me a good time, Ivy?

504
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,500
Damn!

505
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,020
That's a shook thick.

506
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,460
Okay, let me fly over real fast.

507
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,220
Whoa!

508
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,120
Give me a sec.

509
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,000
Just gotta fist this one too.

510
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,160
It's just a theory.

511
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,280
Just a joke.

512
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,060
Haha!

513
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,500
Unless...

514
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,480
Thank you for the super chat.

515
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,420
Uh, Black Deer.

516
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,280
Thank you, thank you.

517
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,840
I vote for the name.

518
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,560
That's...

519
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:27,240
Thank you for the Thank you, thank you.

520
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,720
Alright, okay.

521
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,380
How about this?

522
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,820
We're gonna make a community post?

523
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,480
Oh, shit.

524
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,760
Are they like...

525
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,400
Did they get poison Ivy'd?

526
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,360
Whoa!

527
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,600
What about Harley?

528
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,740
That's okay.

529
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,800
We won't be killing anybody.

530
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:49,860
You can buy a punch and make a throne out of them.

531
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,840
LordPacky, thank you for the aca-aca soup.

532
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,620
Thank you.

533
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,220
Alright, I think it's like this way.

534
00:26:59,340 --> 00:26:59,940
Right?

535
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,860
Yeah, it's this way.

536
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:02,860
Alright.

537
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:04,840
Alright.

538
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:12,960
Alright, we will make a community post after this stream for all you guys to suggest the names and then I'll make a poll for you guys to...

539
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,640
One...

540
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:23,360
The Doki Bird FPS VTuber TTV YouTube Facebook is my play button.

541
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:29,600
And then I'll order another one for the Dragoons so you guys get a play button too.

542
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,920
And you guys get to decide.

543
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:38,620
You guys will fight for the name you want on that play button.

544
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,560
Cause technically Dragoons are part of the team.

545
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,780
Cause I couldn't have got 100k without you guys.

546
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,720
Wait, she's not swole!

547
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,740
What's the point?

548
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,380
What's the point if she's not swole?

549
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:09,980
What's the point if she's not swole?

550
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,200
Why doesn't the bane juice make her swole?

551
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,020
Why doesn't the bane juice make her swole?

552
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,590
Holy fuck, what?

553
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:28,650
This looks...

554
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,150
This looks so wrong.

555
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,310
Okay I don't know...What do I do?

556
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,750
What the fuck do I do?

557
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,550
Oh God, what do I do?

558
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,010
Batarangs?

559
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,110
Batarangs?

560
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:39,190
Batarangs?

561
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,250
What do I do?

562
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:44,910
Okay.

563
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,150
Is it Bataran time?

564
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:48,850
Batarang.

565
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,030
Batarang.

566
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:52,790
Oh shit, it is Batarang!

567
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,070
Batarang!

568
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:55,870
Oh fuck.

569
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,170
Okay, it's Bataran.

570
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,510
Always the Bataran.

571
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,010
Okay, open your mouth, Ivy.

572
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:04,930
Batarang!

573
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:06,470
Wait, I can do two Batarangs.

574
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:09,490
Woo!

575
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:09,970
Alright.

576
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,070
Don't worry.

577
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:12,770
Batarang!

578
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:13,130
Batarang!

579
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:13,490
Ow.

580
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,370
Okay, only one Batarang apparently.

581
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:19,870
I can only do one Batarang at a time.

582
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,250
The voice acting!

583
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,090
What about the voice acting?

584
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,170
Can you please...

585
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:30,310
Please, give me the details of what you mean by that.

586
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:30,990
Yes, I can do that.

587
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:31,890
Yes, I'm calling you out.

588
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,510
Fuck, I didn't see your name.

589
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,990
But whoever said that, I'm calling you out right now.

590
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,410
What do you mean by that?

591
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:43,170
Very good voice acting.

592
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:48,690
It's just very good voice acting.

593
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,030
She was clearly doing so well.

594
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:51,790
Like, that's what I mean.

595
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,870
Exactly what he means.

596
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,750
Yeah, thank you for the super chat.

597
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:00,990
Thank you.

598
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:01,630
Thank you.

599
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:01,970
Thank you.

600
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:03,170
Nice.

601
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,430
What kind of boss fight is this?

602
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:06,190
Ivy, come on.

603
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,790
You got the bang juice.

604
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,410
You should be stronger than this.

605
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:16,730
Alright.

606
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:17,350
Nice.

607
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,470
We just gotta run.

608
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:20,330
Thank God for like...

609
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:21,190
You know what?

610
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:21,990
I'm gonna say it.

611
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,630
I'm gonna say it.

612
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:28,650
Fuck Souls genre for making Samana a thing.

613
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:29,410
Hahaha.

614
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:30,750
Hahaha.

615
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,390
I'm gonna say it.

616
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,430
Not every game has to be Souls-like.

617
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:46,150
Sometimes I don't... I want to be able to run forever.

618
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,350
Okay.

619
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:51,950
Batarang.

620
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:53,430
Nice.

621
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:56,890
Alright.

622
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,190
And also realism.

623
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:00,190
Fuck the realism shit.

624
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:07,030
I'm trying to play a man that's wearing fucking underwear outside of his regular suit.

625
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,950
There's no realism to this.

626
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:13,990
Alright.

627
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,330
She's like one hit.

628
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,390
She's loud.

629
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,470
Okay.

630
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,750
Who wants me to tone this down?

631
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:28,910
Alright.

632
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:29,570
Let me...

633
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,770
I want fun, not reality exactly.

634
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,350
Alright.

635
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:36,590
It's fine.

636
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:36,910
I win.

637
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,050
I win.

638
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:38,690
Yay!

639
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:41,490
Hahaha.

640
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,030
I keep it.

641
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,190
Can I just... Hello?

642
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:46,830
Oh.

643
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,910
Explosives gel.

644
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:48,330
Okay.

645
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,350
Alright.

646
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:50,730
Get out.

647
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:54,750
I'm gonna attack your... I'm gonna autograph your plan.

648
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,810
It's mine now.

649
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,510
Now it's my plan.

650
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:00,350
Wait.

651
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:00,970
I have to keep going?

652
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:01,550
Wait.

653
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:02,230
It isn't over?

654
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,350
What do you mean it's not over?

655
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,070
Oh.

656
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:06,310
Oh.

657
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:06,710
Oh.

658
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:06,910
Oh.

659
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,010
I thought it was that easy!

660
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:09,650
No!

661
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:11,290
Wait.

662
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:11,650
I can upgrade.

663
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:12,150
Okay.

664
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,890
Let's just upgrade our heals.

665
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,130
While we're here.

666
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:19,010
I mean we might as well upgrade our heals.

667
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:23,750
I mean... We might... We might as well...

668
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:25,450
Alright.

669
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:26,750
Nice.

670
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,750
He's trying to hurt me.

671
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,050
Oh fuck.

672
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:30,310
Okay.

673
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:30,990
Get out of here.

674
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:32,170
Alright.

675
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:32,870
Get out of here, guy.

676
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:34,290
Please!

677
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:35,070
There's other women!

678
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,400
There's so many choices!

679
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,980
My plans will carry you and your precious god over the shreds.

680
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,140
Wait.

681
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:47,500
What?

682
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,420
Okay.

683
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:48,980
No!

684
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,040
No!

685
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:54,020
Why did you shot your fucking batterams?

686
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:55,360
Fuck.

687
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:55,560
Okay.

688
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,240
That's not good.

689
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,860
She's ready for a run too.

690
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,240
Alright.

691
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,220
Batteram.

692
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,760
God damn it.

693
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,380
I got hit.

694
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,080
Batteram.

695
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,900
I wanna do this.

696
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,220
No!

697
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,120
Oh.

698
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,460
Okay.

699
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:12,660
Okay.

700
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,300
I thought I accidentally...

701
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:13,460
No!

702
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,760
I keep running into it.

703
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,680
God damn it.

704
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,320
I keep accidentally running into obstacles.

705
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:22,700
Alright.

706
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,240
Out.

707
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:23,680
Get out.

708
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:25,880
Batteram.

709
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,520
Batteram.

710
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:27,860
No.

711
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,040
Not.

712
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,300
Oh.

713
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:28,480
Okay.

714
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:28,680
Oh.

715
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,040
Thank god.

716
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,020
There's friendly fire.

717
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,500
Thank god.

718
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,280
Plants can't see which one's the real Batman.

719
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,000
Concussion.

720
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:40,820
We're okay.

721
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,400
Doughkeeper confirmed hate environment activist.

722
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,280
Hey!

723
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:47,640
Hey!

724
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,880
I was president of my environmental club.

725
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,060
Um.

726
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,100
I don't know how to do this.

727
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,200
I don't know how I became president.

728
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:56,920
But like...

729
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,140
I was president!

730
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,800
Thank you for the super chat.

731
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,200
Thank you.

732
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:02,960
Thank you, Tom.

733
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:04,700
What?

734
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:09,580
Look!

735
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,140
It's... It's still...

736
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:14,120
It was still... It was still in my college application.

737
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,000
So it counts.

738
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,920
You know, like, I was that type of Asian...

739
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,740
That basically signed up for anything.

740
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,140
For like everything.

741
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,600
So I can like boost up my college application.

742
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,220
Like you might not believe.

743
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:27,700
Okay.

744
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,040
I...

745
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,500
I want to save the environment.

746
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,260
The environment is very, very important.

747
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,660
But like, you know...

748
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:36,660
You're not like... Like, you know, THE environmentalist.

749
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,260
Yeah.

750
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:41,880
Yeah.

751
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,640
I cared about the environment.

752
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,940
But not to the extent where I should have been the president.

753
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:54,960
It just looked really good on my college applications.

754
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,260
Also...

755
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,900
Andreas, thank you for the five gift of shoes.

756
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:00,280
Thank you.

757
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:00,800
Thank you.

758
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,100
I cared enough.

759
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,180
Yes, that's better.

760
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,880
I... I cared enough about the environment.

761
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:09,940
Okay.

762
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,360
Was it worth it in the end?

763
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,780
I mean, I got to college.

764
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,040
And then I became a VTuber and didn't use my degree for this.

765
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,140
So like...

766
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,160
Yeah.

767
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,000
Hey, hey.

768
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,840
It was Canadian college.

769
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,020
So it's like... You know...

770
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:30,760
So like the tuition fee was not as bad as American college.

771
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:32,820
Alright.

772
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,380
Like at least it was... It was Canadian college.

773
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,740
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

774
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,360
Take his... Kick his ass for Ivy.

775
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,100
Okay.

776
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:44,520
Please.

777
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,020
Please.

778
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,640
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

779
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,160
Alright.

780
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,000
It's alright.

781
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:49,780
Just friendly fire.

782
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:51,580
Alright.

783
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,880
Thank God for friendly fire.

784
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,460
Well... Get out.

785
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,020
Oh God.

786
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:57,720
I need to get out of here.

787
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,320
Friendly fire.

788
00:35:59,380 --> 00:35:59,880
Friendly fire.

789
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:02,720
Okay.

790
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,000
I'll get rid of these guys.

791
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,940
Because apparently it won't stop unless I kill all these... Sorry.

792
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,940
Um... Just make sure they're just... You know, barely alive.

793
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,220
Because Batman doesn't kill.

794
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,260
Alright.

795
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:13,560
Nice.

796
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,920
Well, we got back up.

797
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,160
Don't worry.

798
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,640
I'm pretty sure Ivy will pay for your family.

799
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:19,920
Oh.

800
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:20,580
This way.

801
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,460
I hear you.

802
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:27,920
So close.

803
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:28,680
Boop.

804
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,020
Alright.

805
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,500
I think I need two more hits.

806
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,460
Come on.

807
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,200
Open the mouth.

808
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,280
Open the flat mouth.

809
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,980
No, no, no, no, no.

810
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,380
Oh.

811
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:38,660
Oh.

812
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,280
One hit.

813
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:39,560
One hit.

814
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:39,840
One hit.

815
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,100
One hit.

816
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:40,380
One hit.

817
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:40,600
One hit.

818
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:40,820
One hit.

819
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:41,980
Oh God.

820
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:42,560
I'm one hit.

821
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,260
She's one hit.

822
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,040
Risk it.

823
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:46,900
Easy.

824
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,040
Alright.

825
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:48,700
I'm gonna...

826
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,000
Banksy your plant real quick.

827
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,800
Please be the last one.

828
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,210
That's my signature.

829
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,310
Well, thank you for the super chat.

830
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:06,650
Thank you.

831
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,730
Thank you Canadian College Fun.

832
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,870
Bro, this voice acting.

833
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,920
Oh my God.

834
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,100
I'm just like thinking about how...

835
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:34,080
You know like when you're voice acting, you have to give like a reel of like different like groans and stuff.

836
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,140
Like you're getting hit.

837
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,360
Give me like 30 seconds of that.

838
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,860
I did it, Joker.

839
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,520
Oh, she got another upgrade.

840
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,270
Oh, she got another upgrade.

841
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:03,990
Alright.

842
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,530
Let's upgrade.

843
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,270
We have...

844
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:07,870
Oh.

845
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:08,670
No!

846
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:09,490
Don't...

847
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:11,670
Okay.

848
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,090
Okay.

849
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,550
At least it crashed after.

850
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:18,030
At least it's after.

851
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:21,610
That's all... That's all that matters.

852
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:27,890
It crashed after the fight.

853
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:29,270
Oh, thank God.

854
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:30,690
Oh, thank God.

855
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,930
I was gonna be so sad.

856
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,990
Thank God it wasn't the middle of the Ivy fight.

857
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,650
Oh, thank God.

858
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:37,670
Alright.

859
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:38,650
It should have saved.

860
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:39,370
It should have saved.

861
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,710
We just have to listen to Joker talk again.

862
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:42,550
That's okay.

863
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:46,490
Alright.

864
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:48,090
It's alright.

865
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,410
It's alright.

866
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:50,490
We're almost there.

867
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:52,490
We're almost at the finale.

868
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:57,310
We just need... We just have one more boss left apparently.

869
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:01,700
Alright.

870
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,400
Let's go.

871
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,380
I forgot what I was talking about.

872
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:09,390
Alright.

873
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:09,790
Here we go.

874
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,840
The crash.

875
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:20,900
My biggest boss.

876
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,040
Ta-da!

877
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,220
That's me!

878
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,420
Where did I go?

879
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,140
Okay.

880
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,100
I have to wait until he tells me what to do.

881
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,620
For me?

882
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,300
Whoa!

883
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,920
Sounds so fun, Joker!

884
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,220
Okay.

885
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,440
Alright.

886
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,920
We gotta go to the party.

887
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:50,760
Oh my God.

888
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,120
I got invited to a party.

889
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:53,660
Alright.

890
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:57,400
There's really nothing else to upgrade now.

891
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:57,980
Right?

892
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,080
His powers.

893
00:39:59,260 --> 00:39:59,940
That was easier.

894
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,140
Wait!

895
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,060
I could have made this easier for myself!

896
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,300
I would have reached and open up access that would otherwise...

897
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:07,700
Wait!

898
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,520
I could have... I could have made this easier!

899
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,220
Oh, but guys, what if three batter... guys, why didn't you tell me... guys, you know I don't read.

900
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,080
You know I don't fucking read.

901
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,220
I was expecting you guys to help me choose the best upgrades.

902
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:40,360
But, but Doki, two is... three is better than two.

903
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,580
Guys, we don't need more batterangs.

904
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,880
We don't need more batterangs.

905
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,260
Fine, we'll have more batterangs.

906
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,160
Fine.

907
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,300
Three is better than two.

908
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,580
Alright, where do I go?

909
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,840
Where the fuck's the party?

910
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,640
Three, alright.

911
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,500
Guys, we could have made the hacking easier.

912
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,780
What do you mean?

913
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,800
I would have struggled so hard trying to hack!

914
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,660
Did someone say more batterangs?

915
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,300
I swear to fucking god.

916
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,120
Alright, let's get these guys out of here.

917
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:20,940
Alright.

918
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,040
Well, it's not really... it can't have more brain damage, right?

919
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,360
They already lost causes, I feel like.

920
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:33,100
Unless Batman, you know, starts funding the medical...

921
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,840
the medical fund in the city.

922
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:42,950
I still can't believe Batman was big pharma this entire time.

923
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:46,090
No wonder everybody's crazy here.

924
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:48,870
This is how he makes his money.

925
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:52,090
But the TV is Doki.

926
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:57,230
Who's that?

927
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,110
What's going on over there?

928
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:01,930
What is that?

929
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:04,970
What's that say?

930
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:06,530
Monster Cell?

931
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:07,930
Oh my god!

932
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:10,970
Oh my god!

933
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:12,710
This is it!

934
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:14,070
Hey guys.

935
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:18,490
If your name's not on the list, you ain't going in.

936
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:19,890
But it's me, Batman!

937
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:20,910
Let's see.

938
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,570
A... no, that's not right.

939
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:25,770
B... Bane...

940
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,150
Ah!

941
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,050
Here it is.

942
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,470
That's right, I should get VIP right now.

943
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:30,970
Hey!

944
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:34,150
I'm the guest of honor?

945
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,630
Give him a big welcome, guys!

946
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:39,750
It's me, I'm special!

947
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:42,430
Get some!

948
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:43,150
Yay!

949
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:45,690
Oh my god!

950
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:48,110
Guys, how do you know it's my birthday?

951
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:50,230
Because every day is my birthday.

952
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:52,990
Yay!

953
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:56,370
Happy birthday to me!

954
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:59,470
Happy birthday to me!

955
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:00,230
What?

956
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:02,070
Where's the birthdays?

957
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:03,850
Hello?

958
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:05,910
Birthday?

959
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:08,990
Are you excited, Max?

960
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:09,850
Yeah?

961
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:12,490
We've been building up to this point all night.

962
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:16,990
Don't tell me you've not been looking forward to it.

963
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:19,870
I know I have.

964
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:20,770
Where's the cake?

965
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:21,930
Surprise!

966
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:27,330
Everyone always said I should be in television.

967
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:29,210
You don't want to miss this.

968
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:29,430
Really.

969
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,830
It'll be a blast.

970
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:34,030
Oh my god, you were here this entire time?

971
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:35,470
Nine.

972
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:37,690
Eight.

973
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:40,270
Seven, six, five, four.

974
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:41,550
Wait, where are you going?

975
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:42,850
Wait.

976
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:43,710
Wait a minute.

977
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:44,930
Wait a minute.

978
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:45,190
What?

979
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:46,390
Oh!

980
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:46,870
Oh!

981
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,390
Wait a minute.

982
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:53,930
Is that a bomb?

983
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:05,710
Oh, hey, I like how the blast put me closer to the room.

984
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,790
It like sucked me back in.

985
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:09,310
Why

986
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,740
didn't you stop Batman?

987
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:20,140
Me?

988
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,300
It was your plan, you goofy clown!

989
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,260
I know.

990
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:24,880
I know.

991
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:28,080
How did the bomb explode me closer to the window?

992
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,260
It's like a black hole.

993
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:33,100
I'm sending you back to the ventriloquist where you belong.

994
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,120
Oh shit.

995
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,500
What, is that a guard?

996
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,220
You had to spoil everything, didn't you?

997
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,880
Beating up Bane, feeding Scarecrow to- Whoa!

998
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:54,700
...what's on your mind, Holly?

999
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,300
My hobby, by the way.

1000
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,480
Whoa, Joker!

1001
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,620
It's over, Joker.

1002
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:03,420
Over?

1003
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:04,780
Why, my dear?

1004
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:04,920
You're not scared of me, are you?

1005
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:13,740
Joker, damn!

1006
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,020
The saddest thing is you know Harley would pay for it too.

1007
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,480
That's like the saddest thing.

1008
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,360
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1009
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,200
Alright, it's fine.

1010
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:29,740
We will...

1011
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:32,240
We'll get on top of this guy.

1012
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:34,800
Oh god, oh god, no!

1013
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:35,620
Fuck!

1014
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,300
Oh, get away from me, get away from me!

1015
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,860
It's alright, there's friendly fo- Please.

1016
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:44,940
Please, game.

1017
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:46,300
Please.

1018
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,200
Please, we were so...

1019
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:49,840
Please!

1020
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:56,910
Please let me out!

1021
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:59,110
Let me out!

1022
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:06,830
I just... I just wanna beat the Batman.

1023
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:09,630
I just wanna beat Batman.

1024
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:15,450
Perfectly optimized game.

1025
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:16,650
Guys!

1026
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:19,330
It can't mostly be my PC.

1027
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:22,650
It's also because this game is very old.

1028
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:26,390
And the older games are rarely ever optimized for newer PCs.

1029
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:27,710
Guys!

1030
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:30,770
Look, my PC might be a tomato.

1031
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:32,250
But like...

1032
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:34,030
You can't fully play this.

1033
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:34,750
I'm gonna play it on my PC!

1034
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:39,650
This game needs a remake?

1035
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:40,570
I don't know.

1036
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:42,230
I don't trust remakes anymore.

1037
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:43,870
Unless...

1038
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:47,890
I mean, like, Dead Space is like one of the rare remakes that actually like...

1039
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:48,330
Ow!

1040
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:49,010
Oh, okay.

1041
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:49,910
That didn't hit me.

1042
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:50,370
That's great.

1043
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:55,550
Dead Space is like one of the rare...

1044
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:58,150
rare remakes that like are actually...

1045
00:46:58,150 --> 00:46:59,110
they actually...

1046
00:46:59,110 --> 00:46:59,890
Oh, nice!

1047
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:01,330
He's better at bowling than me.

1048
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:06,370
Oh, fuck!

1049
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:06,690
Okay!

1050
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:11,050
They already got a remake?

1051
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:13,090
This is the game of the year version.

1052
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:14,770
Wait, when did they get a remake?

1053
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:19,230
Alright, nice.

1054
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:20,010
Got it.

1055
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:24,730
No, no, no, no, no!

1056
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:25,110
Fuck!

1057
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:30,390
They're lying!

1058
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:32,030
Console only.

1059
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:33,090
God damn it!

1060
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:34,010
It's always console only.

1061
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:38,010
Too lazy to play this on console.

1062
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:39,690
Why can't everything be on Steam?

1063
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:42,950
Dude, fuck console exclusives, man.

1064
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:44,970
I hate console exclusives so much.

1065
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:47,810
There's no point!

1066
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:50,490
There's no fucking point!

1067
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:52,930
Bowling!

1068
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,360
Console exclusive is fucking stupid.

1069
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,300
I'm gonna say it.

1070
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,280
Cause eventually...

1071
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,240
Nothing is ever console exclusive.

1072
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,400
Eventually everything comes back to Steam.

1073
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,120
Wow, ouch.

1074
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,320
Very hurtful.

1075
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:14,800
Everything eventually gets on Steam.

1076
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,620
There's no such thing as console exclusive.

1077
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,540
It's all a bait.

1078
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,040
It's all a fucking bait!

1079
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:22,800
Except for Nintendo Switch stuff.

1080
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,100
Cause like...

1081
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:28,460
It's harder to like port things from the Switch to PC.

1082
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,040
Alright, nice.

1083
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:34,220
I'm just gonna use these guys as bowling for a little bit.

1084
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:37,520
Alright, nice.

1085
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:38,880
Thank God for bowling.

1086
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,880
Except Bloodborne...

1087
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,800
I feel like eventually Bloodborne will get ported to Steam.

1088
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:48,280
It's just like...

1089
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,400
It just takes like...

1090
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,260
Uh...

1091
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,820
I feel like it...

1092
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:58,060
There has to be like some fucking contract right now that's restricting it from porting it.

1093
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,680
But I feel like eventually it's gonna happen.

1094
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:03,780
Okay, nice.

1095
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:04,220
Okay, nice.

1096
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:04,440
Woo!

1097
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:05,520
Woo!

1098
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,160
Oh!

1099
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,080
Get over here!

1100
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,020
Get over here!

1101
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,660
Get over here!

1102
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:11,620
Nice.

1103
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:12,860
It's time to...

1104
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:14,800
It's time to slap them.

1105
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,800
It's time to slap your friends.

1106
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,400
That's fucking right.

1107
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:21,500
It's been a decade.

1108
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,060
I mean, eventually contracts run out, right?

1109
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:26,780
Right, guys?

1110
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:30,820
I feel like we're gonna see like a remake of Blood...

1111
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:31,240
Uh...

1112
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:32,480
Boop!

1113
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,200
Maybe a remaster of Bloodborne.

1114
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,360
Or a remaster of Bloodborne on Steam or some shit.

1115
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,160
Get the fuck away from me!

1116
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:39,040
Woo!

1117
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:41,820
Leave me alone!

1118
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:42,960
Leave me alone!

1119
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:45,600
Leave me alone!

1120
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:49,340
Alright.

1121
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:53,560
Come on, please.

1122
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:57,140
Please kill the rest of the henchmen!

1123
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:58,860
There's like three left!

1124
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:00,640
Just kill the henchmen!

1125
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:01,280
Throw them...

1126
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:01,920
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait.

1127
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:02,840
No!

1128
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,020
How do you miss?

1129
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:04,180
Oh!

1130
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:04,360
How do you miss?

1131
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:04,720
You're not me!

1132
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,420
How do you miss?

1133
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:07,360
Nice.

1134
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:07,740
Okay.

1135
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,860
Alright, slam on the wall.

1136
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:10,660
Ow!

1137
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:12,700
Oh no.

1138
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:13,140
Yes.

1139
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,020
Alright.

1140
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:14,660
Good.

1141
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:15,460
I can slap them.

1142
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,500
I can slap them now.

1143
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:19,760
Bam.

1144
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:22,320
Alright.

1145
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:23,360
Two...

1146
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:23,840
Wait!

1147
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:24,360
Where did...

1148
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,540
How did all these guys keep...

1149
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:26,020
Wait a minute!

1150
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:28,940
Where did all of these guys come from?

1151
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,240
Oh shit.

1152
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:30,640
Woo!

1153
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:31,320
No!

1154
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:32,560
My leg!

1155
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,060
My leg!

1156
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:34,180
My leg!

1157
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,560
Where did they come from?

1158
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,520
They spawned indefinitely?

1159
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,200
No.

1160
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,280
No.

1161
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:50,600
The last time you said that, it wasn't true!

1162
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,240
There's no way!

1163
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,960
The last time you said that, that wasn't true!

1164
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:01,880
No!

1165
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:04,180
No!

1166
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,900
I'm not joking this time.

1167
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,020
No joking.

1168
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,720
This time is for real.

1169
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:12,940
Okay, nice.

1170
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:14,460
Okay.

1171
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:15,580
It's fine.

1172
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:19,120
We're gonna have to head over to this guy.

1173
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,240
Okay, I almost got one down.

1174
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:23,320
That's almost close.

1175
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:24,900
One down.

1176
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:27,700
I'm trying!

1177
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,840
There's so many henchmen!

1178
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:33,080
No!

1179
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:33,760
My leg!

1180
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:34,180
Oh!

1181
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,500
God damn it, Batman!

1182
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:38,460
Okay.

1183
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:41,300
Nice.

1184
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:42,140
Oh!

1185
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:43,780
I'm like one HP.

1186
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,040
I'm like one HP right now.

1187
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:45,840
Please.

1188
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,380
Please run over to me.

1189
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:48,700
No!

1190
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:49,660
Don't pick up the body!

1191
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:51,960
All right, I can dodge this.

1192
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:52,580
Whoop!

1193
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:54,840
Oh, well, I guess I'm not gonna be dodging anything.

1194
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:56,960
Oh!

1195
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,000
Nice to dodge it!

1196
00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,360
Thank God!

1197
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,280
Woo!

1198
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,160
Okay.

1199
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:03,280
I can punch him.

1200
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:03,800
No!

1201
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:04,180
No!

1202
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:06,980
All right, one guy left!

1203
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:07,420
One guy!

1204
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:08,400
No!

1205
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:10,260
No!

1206
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:13,240
Please!

1207
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:15,380
Yes!

1208
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,100
Oh!

1209
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,000
We got one of them!

1210
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:19,860
Okay, we just gotta leave.

1211
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:22,300
Okay.

1212
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:23,620
This will be easier now.

1213
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:25,560
Now that there's one, it'll be easier.

1214
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,180
It should be easier, theoretically.

1215
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:31,280
Theoretically, it should be easier.

1216
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:33,900
All right, all right, all right, all right.

1217
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:34,940
Come on.

1218
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:35,640
Come on.

1219
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:35,940
Just...

1220
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:36,700
Just run.

1221
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,120
Yes!

1222
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,120
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1223
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:43,140
Okay.

1224
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:45,300
Oh, thank God!

1225
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:46,680
Oh!

1226
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:47,460
Thank God!

1227
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:49,060
One HP in the dream!

1228
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,200
Nice.

1229
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:52,580
Oh!

1230
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,160
Shit!

1231
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,660
I thought it was over!

1232
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,420
I thought it was over!

1233
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:57,640
I almost could've died.

1234
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,040
Nicely done, Bats!

1235
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,780
You deserve a prize!

1236
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:06,140
Your old pal, Commissioner Gordon.

1237
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:06,680
Oh!

1238
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:07,240
Gordon?

1239
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:11,500
Say, he looks all run down.

1240
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,060
What happened, Gordon?

1241
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,220
Wait, what?

1242
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:16,820
Oh!

1243
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:18,460
Batman!

1244
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:20,540
What did he do?

1245
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,840
What is this?

1246
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:23,820
Get away!

1247
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,260
Oh my God, I'm gonna Bane out.

1248
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:29,500
Here we go!

1249
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:34,920
You're trying to resist a change!

1250
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,500
That's not fair!

1251
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:36,920
Oh!

1252
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,560
Come on, get in!

1253
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:39,480
Get in!

1254
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:42,720
No!

1255
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,120
His pure body!

1256
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,740
That's definitely not all natural!

1257
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:54,380
How am I gonna join the Olympics now, Joker?

1258
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:56,040
My big night!

1259
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,820
Months of planning down the crapper!

1260
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:09,480
I just wanted to bring down your grim facade and for once, let you see the world as I see it.

1261
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:12,500
Giggling in a corner and bleeding.

1262
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:15,440
But you've denied me even that.

1263
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,680
I have nothing to live for.

1264
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,400
Oh, shit!

1265
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,740
That's actually scary.

1266
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,640
Joker on venom juice.

1267
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,680
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1268
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:37,920
Under lockdown, its staff at the mercy of the rampaging inmates.

1269
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:41,040
Just ten minutes ago, we received this ten-minute report.

1270
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:41,480
first message was a late message.

1271
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,600
Greetings, Gotham!

1272
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,120
Joker here!

1273
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:47,420
Viva!

1274
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,860
Thank you for the super chat!

1275
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:49,660
Thank you, thank you.

1276
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,820
Wait, the Olympics are all clean?

1277
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,340
Since when?

1278
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:58,380
Whoa!

1279
00:54:58,380 --> 00:54:59,760
You should...

1280
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:01,760
That's what you say!

1281
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:04,840
You whispered that!

1282
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,880
I like how...

1283
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,500
I like how the Bane juice makes him have a mohawk.

1284
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:16,680
As if it affects his fucking hair.

1285
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:24,070
That's for inside voices, not outside voices.

1286
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:27,630
What the fuck?

1287
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:29,490
Two freaks in a fight to the death!

1288
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:30,450
Oh look!

1289
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:32,110
He gets to keep his underwear too.

1290
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:40,280
I feel like the one thing that should have been ripped open is the underwear.

1291
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:41,780
And pants.

1292
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:54,620
No!

1293
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:03,060
Joker, this body is all natural!

1294
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,160
I don't need no...

1295
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,620
I don't need performance enhancements!

1296
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:31,400
What the fuck is wrong with your nails?

1297
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,360
Holy shit!

1298
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:34,980
Joker, cut your nails!

1299
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:37,440
That's so uncomfortable!

1300
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:38,220
Ow!

1301
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:41,580
Alright, how the fuck do I kill you?

1302
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:44,620
Do I throw batarangs at you?

1303
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,840
Wait, this is the worst...

1304
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,220
Please, we're so close.

1305
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:55,500
Please.

1306
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:57,700
Please, we're so close.

1307
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,640
We're so close!

1308
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:07,380
Joker, please!

1309
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:16,360
Oh my god!

1310
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,480
How did my crashes get worse?

1311
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,260
That's like the one thing I don't understand!

1312
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:25,300
It's like every time I boot up this game, every...

1313
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:28,360
Like, the more days I pass, the worse the crashes get.

1314
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,700
Like, how did it get worse?

1315
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:34,620
Oh my god!

1316
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,060
Please, we're so close.

1317
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:39,680
We're like literally in the finish line.

1318
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:43,480
We're like literally at the finish line.

1319
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:44,540
Please!

1320
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:46,720
Please!

1321
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:48,060
Alright.

1322
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,240
Here we go.

1323
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:50,640
It's alright.

1324
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:52,740
It's like I never got slapped in the first place.

1325
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:54,940
Boop!

1326
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:55,500
Boop!

1327
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:56,720
Ow!

1328
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:57,680
What the fuck?

1329
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:58,760
How do I get away from that?

1330
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:00,260
Alright.

1331
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:05,480
Bob Joker is too strong.

1332
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:07,560
What do I do?

1333
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:09,100
Alright.

1334
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:10,940
I mean, these guys are easy to beat.

1335
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:14,180
As long as they're not the tanky ones, that's fine.

1336
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:17,220
I'm fine if they're not the super tanky ones.

1337
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,140
Wait, there's presents!

1338
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:21,780
For me?

1339
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:23,940
Okay.

1340
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:24,540
Throw.

1341
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:25,700
Nice.

1342
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:27,340
It's fine.

1343
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,980
I can literally just X everything.

1344
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,640
X, X, X.

1345
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:32,540
X and then Y.

1346
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:33,620
Gosh.

1347
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:33,920
No!

1348
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,700
It's never good to counter!

1349
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,240
There's never a good time to counter!

1350
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,000
Oh shit.

1351
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:41,180
How do I get rid of this?

1352
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:42,240
How do I get rid of teeth?

1353
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:43,100
Teeth!

1354
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:44,380
Get away from me, teeth!

1355
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:46,300
Alright, nice.

1356
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:47,840
I just need to help the other one.

1357
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:51,320
Use the middle stick to avoid the crashes.

1358
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,660
It's fine.

1359
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,160
We're fine.

1360
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:58,920
Now I can just Y everything.

1361
00:58:59,300 --> 00:58:59,780
Nope.

1362
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:00,260
Never mind.

1363
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:01,380
What?

1364
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:03,840
What's going on?

1365
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:06,140
What the fuck happened?

1366
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:07,540
Wow!

1367
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,220
Oh my god!

1368
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:11,760
Oh my god!

1369
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,400
What the fuck happened?

1370
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,640
What the fuck happened?

1371
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:25,610
Holy shit!

1372
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:27,330
Oh my god!

1373
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:29,810
Batman's fucking up my PC!

1374
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:36,270
Oh my god!

1375
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:39,250
Batman's like fucking up my PC!

1376
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:40,590
My PC's like, please!

1377
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:42,990
Please beat Batman!

1378
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:45,070
Please!

1379
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:48,410
Holy shit!

1380
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:51,410
Please beat Batman!

1381
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:54,130
We need you to beat Batman!

1382
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:57,310
Oh my god!

1383
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:01,530
Oh my god!

1384
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:05,150
Bro, my fucking thing is freaking out right now!

1385
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:08,630
Everything is freaking out!

1386
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:10,750
Holy shit!

1387
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:12,970
Oh my god!

1388
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:14,710
I don't know.

1389
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:16,430
I don't know if it's okay.

1390
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:20,270
Please get me out of this hellhole!

1391
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:21,770
Get me out!

1392
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:22,630
Ow!

1393
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:28,830
Holy shit!

1394
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:29,870
Please!

1395
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:33,050
Let me kill Batman!

1396
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:35,770
Not Batman!

1397
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:36,890
Let me kill Joker!

1398
01:00:37,970 --> 01:00:39,450
Oh my god!

1399
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:42,230
Wait, there's more?

1400
01:00:43,870 --> 01:00:44,910
Oh god!

1401
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:46,650
Oh god!

1402
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:47,830
Am I back in it?

1403
01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:49,390
Use your imagination!

1404
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:52,010
Bro, we're not back!

1405
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:53,490
Holy shit!

1406
01:00:57,130 --> 01:00:58,170
Where am I?

1407
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:00,270
Where am I?

1408
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:03,570
Oh my god!

1409
01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:05,150
Oh my god!

1410
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:05,850
Give me a sec!

1411
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:07,250
Give me a sec!

1412
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:09,330
It's a journey right now!

1413
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:10,690
It's a journey!

1414
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:11,690
Hahaha!

1415
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:15,090
Holy shit!

1416
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:17,570
It's okay, we're here!

1417
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:18,810
It's okay!

1418
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:20,850
We're almost back, guys!

1419
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:25,030
I just need you guys to know my OBS window is also frozen.

1420
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:27,570
So I don't even know what it looks like right now.

1421
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:29,210
I don't even know!

1422
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:33,930
My OBS window is actually frozen.

1423
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:39,950
So like, I don't even know what it looks like at the moment.

1424
01:01:40,390 --> 01:01:40,690
I...

1425
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:40,790
I...

1426
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:43,850
Okay, I'm just gonna assume I'm back up.

1427
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:46,630
I'm gonna assume...

1428
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:47,410
Am I...

1429
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:48,390
Am I on the screen?

1430
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:50,610
Guys, am I on the s- Oh!

1431
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:51,830
That's not...

1432
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:54,170
Okay, that's not what I wanted.

1433
01:01:59,770 --> 01:02:00,730
Extra life.

1434
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:01,190
Okay.

1435
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:02,370
Alright, this one.

1436
01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:04,510
This is the right one, I think.

1437
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:05,990
Yeah, there we go!

1438
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:08,230
I had to look at my YouTube preview.

1439
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:09,370
We're fine!

1440
01:02:09,370 --> 01:02:10,430
Everything's fine!

1441
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:12,810
Alright, here we go!

1442
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:14,210
We're back!

1443
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:16,290
We're back!

1444
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:21,150
How do I kill Joker?

1445
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:23,390
Please.

1446
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,250
Oh, God.

1447
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:29,570
Please, we need to get me out of here!

1448
01:02:30,670 --> 01:02:32,270
Get me outta here!

1449
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:37,610
Ow!

1450
01:02:37,610 --> 01:02:38,210
Ow!

1451
01:02:38,770 --> 01:02:39,250
Ow!

1452
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:39,950
I wasn't looking!

1453
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:45,070
It's okay, we're fine.

1454
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:46,190
We're back.

1455
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:47,850
Use the Bat Claw!

1456
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:48,910
Okay, I figured it out.

1457
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:51,090
I figured it out, guys.

1458
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:53,910
I have to use the Bat Claw.

1459
01:02:54,310 --> 01:02:57,290
For my pure intuition, I figured out how to kill Joker.

1460
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:00,790
Aw, that's mean.

1461
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:03,310
What?

1462
01:03:03,470 --> 01:03:03,870
Ow.

1463
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:07,430
I'm done here!

1464
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:07,590
I'm done here!

1465
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:08,810
Nice, I got him!

1466
01:03:09,470 --> 01:03:11,270
I did it all by myself!

1467
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:12,810
Get down!

1468
01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:16,510
My natural intuition!

1469
01:03:16,830 --> 01:03:18,490
Without looking at chat!

1470
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:20,510
Boom, boom!

1471
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:24,810
That's fucking right, you're never gonna get out of this.

1472
01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:30,130
Ow!

1473
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:35,090
Okay, can I run away from this?

1474
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:41,980
What if I just... Alright, round two.

1475
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,780
Oh my god, it's like Mario!

1476
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:46,040
Three hits and you're out!

1477
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:51,140
Okay, what if I... I have three batarangs right now.

1478
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:53,380
Alright, nice.

1479
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:55,860
Oh shit!

1480
01:03:58,700 --> 01:03:59,260
Nice.

1481
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,540
We're fine, we're fine.

1482
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:02,400
Everything is fine.

1483
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,580
I'm doing all the combos necessary.

1484
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:09,560
Okay.

1485
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:11,460
Look at that, I'm comboing!

1486
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:12,880
Finally!

1487
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,260
It took me the rest of this game to learn how to combo!

1488
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:22,040
Oh god, maybe my... Yes, okay, I just need to bait these guys.

1489
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:23,440
To kill them.

1490
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:25,500
Oh shit, nope.

1491
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:26,560
No knife.

1492
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:30,620
It's alright, we're good.

1493
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,880
Just have to keep...

1494
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,220
We just have to make sure we don't get hit.

1495
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:37,240
Everything will be fine.

1496
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:40,300
Alright, nice.

1497
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:41,620
Explode.

1498
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:45,920
Hold down!

1499
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:47,340
Just don't hit me!

1500
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:47,660
No!

1501
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:51,720
I'm so close!

1502
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:54,280
No!

1503
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:56,180
Why didn't you come down?

1504
01:04:58,820 --> 01:04:59,180
No!

1505
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,040
It's not fair!

1506
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:16,340
It should be like a magical girl cutscene where nothing interrupts you when I transform into a magical girl, but instead nobody interrupts me when I fucking try to kill Joker.

1507
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:19,680
There's no etiquette!

1508
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:22,200
I can't believe it!

1509
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:24,260
Alright.

1510
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:26,240
It's okay, we're fine.

1511
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:28,440
We're fine.

1512
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,860
Where is the etiquette?

1513
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:34,020
You're supposed to not touch somebody when they're doing this.

1514
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:34,840
I'm not doing the cutscene.

1515
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,600
I'll give you something for the morning news Gotham!

1516
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:42,980
No, it's like when you're in a cutscene, you don't interrupt them!

1517
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:45,240
That's always the rule!

1518
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:46,400
I'm gonna explode.

1519
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:47,240
I'm gonna explode.

1520
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:48,220
Please!

1521
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:48,520
No!

1522
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,400
So close!

1523
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:53,080
You brought me back.

1524
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:53,800
Stop!

1525
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:57,220
Stop!

1526
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:58,580
I'm gonna go away!

1527
01:05:58,920 --> 01:05:59,560
Please!

1528
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:00,380
Stop!

1529
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:02,380
This is not fair.

1530
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:04,540
This is not fair!

1531
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,220
This boss fight fucking sucks!

1532
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:13,280
I can't believe it.

1533
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,220
Why does it take so long?

1534
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:15,760
Batman!

1535
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:18,500
Why don't you have better upper body strength?

1536
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,340
I don't understand.

1537
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:26,220
Why?

1538
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:28,440
Why are you not jacked enough?

1539
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:31,860
Okay, here we go.

1540
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,440
Jack Ryder!

1541
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:34,440
Can you hear me?

1542
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:35,040
Okay.

1543
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:36,900
Alright, here we go!

1544
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:37,620
We got it!

1545
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:38,360
Hey!

1546
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:40,140
Here we go!

1547
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:41,260
Batman!

1548
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,660
You could have made more antidotes!

1549
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:47,900
You'll die!

1550
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:48,700
Alright, nice.

1551
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:50,580
Alright, one more.

1552
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:53,800
We just need one more.

1553
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:55,920
And then we should be fine.

1554
01:06:57,460 --> 01:06:58,680
You ready for this?

1555
01:06:58,680 --> 01:06:59,400
Can I just run away?

1556
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:00,660
There's no way.

1557
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:01,100
There's no way.

1558
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:02,260
I understand now.

1559
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:03,580
Never dodge, bro.

1560
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:04,080
Just run.

1561
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,020
Alright, here we go.

1562
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:09,380
Here we go.

1563
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:10,000
Last one.

1564
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:13,340
Last one.

1565
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,780
There's no way I can get distracted this time.

1566
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:19,280
As long as I keep...

1567
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,500
As long as I keep throwing my punch.

1568
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:22,180
Ow.

1569
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:23,320
Oh no.

1570
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:24,760
Oh no, he has guns.

1571
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:25,600
No!

1572
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,640
Why are you letting them have guns now?

1573
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:30,300
This is not fair!

1574
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:33,580
This is not fair!

1575
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:35,860
Okay.

1576
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:37,880
I gotta get rid of him.

1577
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:40,860
Oh god, oh god.

1578
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:41,960
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1579
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:43,960
Get the gun away.

1580
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:44,580
Get the gun away.

1581
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:45,300
No guns!

1582
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:46,580
No guns allowed!

1583
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:47,920
Melees only!

1584
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:50,180
Okay.

1585
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,380
I gotta get rid of him.

1586
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:54,120
Bye.

1587
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:54,920
I don't like...

1588
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,580
I don't like the fucking...

1589
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:59,200
Okay, I'm gonna hope the bombs will kill them for me.

1590
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:00,340
Okay.

1591
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:02,280
God damn it.

1592
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:02,960
There's so many.

1593
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:04,420
Oh!

1594
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:05,420
Who has the gun?

1595
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:06,760
Who has the gun?

1596
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:07,660
How did you get the gun?

1597
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:08,960
Oh shit.

1598
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:10,480
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.

1599
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:11,380
How did you get a gun?

1600
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:13,840
Where did you get that?

1601
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:15,340
Alright.

1602
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,600
I gotta make sure...

1603
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:18,020
Alright.

1604
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:19,340
Trigger.

1605
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:20,960
Nice.

1606
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:22,100
Okay.

1607
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:22,880
Why?

1608
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:24,360
Dodge?

1609
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:26,400
God.

1610
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,020
No wonder.

1611
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:28,020
No wonder.

1612
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,800
Everyone was like, this is the worst one.

1613
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:31,280
No wonder.

1614
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:34,660
No wonder everyone was like, this is the worst boss fight.

1615
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:35,100
I...

1616
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:35,960
I agree.

1617
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:37,700
I fucking agree.

1618
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:40,040
This is the worst boss fight.

1619
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:43,060
Jesus Christ.

1620
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:44,200
Alright.

1621
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:46,340
Nice.

1622
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:46,680
Okay.

1623
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:47,780
Got that.

1624
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:49,400
Then...

1625
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:50,320
Get closer.

1626
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:50,740
Get closer.

1627
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:52,560
No, it's not close enough!

1628
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:55,940
Please, jump!

1629
01:08:58,420 --> 01:08:59,540
Okay, thank god.

1630
01:08:59,620 --> 01:09:00,720
No, no, no, not the gun!

1631
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:06,160
Okay, we got rid of the gun.

1632
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:09,360
Yes!

1633
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:09,800
No!

1634
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:13,440
Please don't get closer!

1635
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:14,260
No, no, no, no, no!

1636
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:15,220
Fuck you!

1637
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:22,660
Nooooo!

1638
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:25,340
My buddy died!

1639
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,880
How did you live?

1640
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,300
How did you live?

1641
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,780
Who let you live?

1642
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:40,420
Okay, there we go.

1643
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:41,860
We should be fine.

1644
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,720
Please, please, do not get close to me!

1645
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:44,440
Please!

1646
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:48,520
Please!

1647
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:52,640
Oh my god.

1648
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:55,760
How do they keep coming back?

1649
01:09:56,410 --> 01:09:58,840
It's just, it's always the one guy.

1650
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:03,320
Why is it always the one guy?

1651
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:05,460
No, no.

1652
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:08,180
Okay, fine.

1653
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:12,100
It's always the one guy.

1654
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:14,520
Okay.

1655
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,840
There's no way I can get interrupted now.

1656
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:19,260
No!

1657
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:22,860
It's always you!

1658
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:23,460
It's always you!

1659
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:25,100
Terrible new one for me!

1660
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:29,280
I always keep getting one guy.

1661
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:32,000
Like, how is this possible?

1662
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:34,240
How is this possible?

1663
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:36,160
How is it always one?

1664
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:36,660
How is it always one?

1665
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:40,400
I don't understand.

1666
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,520
Okay, there's no way.

1667
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:46,240
Okay.

1668
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:48,360
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1669
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:48,740
No!

1670
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:49,300
One shot!

1671
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:51,080
No!

1672
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:52,820
Okay.

1673
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:54,980
We gotta get rid of all three.

1674
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:56,860
I don't trust all of these guys.

1675
01:10:58,880 --> 01:10:59,360
Okay!

1676
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:00,620
There's no way!

1677
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,140
There's no way!

1678
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:03,740
There is no way!

1679
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:06,080
How?

1680
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:07,380
How?

1681
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:08,820
How?

1682
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:10,640
How?

1683
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:14,400
Oh my god.

1684
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,540
I don't know how this keeps happening to me.

1685
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:17,460
I...

1686
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:20,420
This is actually, like, impressive.

1687
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,660
I... I can't even...

1688
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:23,200
You know what?

1689
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:25,820
This is actually pretty impressive now.

1690
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:26,640
It's...

1691
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:32,220
Oh, this is...

1692
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:33,000
Oh, this is...

1693
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:33,900
Oh, god.

1694
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,960
I'm sorry, Gordon!

1695
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:37,520
I keep getting one guy!

1696
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:39,680
I'm so sorry!

1697
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:42,680
I...

1698
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:43,460
I...

1699
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,620
I'm sorry, Gordon!

1700
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,480
I don't know how this keeps happening!

1701
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,900
I've got a message for all my adoring fans in...

1702
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:56,140
I've got a message for all my adoring fans in...

1703
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:57,180
There's no way!

1704
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,280
There's no way!

1705
01:11:58,700 --> 01:11:59,060
No!

1706
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:07,060
Tonight, Gotham, I have defeated your dear Dark Knight.

1707
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,180
I have defeated your dear Dark Knight.

1708
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:11,380
He's still alive!

1709
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:12,300
He's still alive!

1710
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:14,260
Let's get ready to...

1711
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,520
There's no way!

1712
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:20,180
Why is it always one guy?

1713
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:23,400
Why is it always one guy?

1714
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:25,680
Why is it always one guy?

1715
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:26,880
How is this possible?

1716
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:30,600
How is it always one person that was alive?

1717
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:32,180
How is it always one person that was alive?

1718
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:32,280
How?

1719
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,740
I thought they were all dead!

1720
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:39,000
There's no fucking way!

1721
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:39,500
There's no fucking way!

1722
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:41,840
I'm actually so unlucky.

1723
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,420
I've never been so unlucky before.

1724
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:47,220
I'm actually so unlucky.

1725
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:47,980
Oh my god.

1726
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:49,860
Oh my god.

1727
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:50,820
To think...

1728
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:53,520
Everyone's dead except for one.

1729
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,520
Except for one!

1730
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:02,000
That's actually so unlucky.

1731
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:03,560
Get out!

1732
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:06,380
Alright.

1733
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:08,100
Explode.

1734
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:09,720
Build Water.

1735
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:11,960
So 까💶 I can't believe it.

1736
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:16,340
I would think that they're dead, but then they keep coming back.

1737
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:18,420
They keep coming back!

1738
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:21,380
It never stops.

1739
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:22,600
Are you all down?

1740
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:24,880
Are you all down for once?

1741
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:27,260
Oh my god.

1742
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:42,080
How have I got such a dumb bird brain as my Oshii?

1743
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:45,580
How was I supposed to know that one guy?

1744
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:50,780
This has nothing to do with luck.

1745
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,920
I thought he was dead!

1746
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:00,360
Alright, here we go.

1747
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:01,360
We're fine this time.

1748
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:04,060
It's fine this time.

1749
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:06,780
I'll double tap for real, guys.

1750
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:07,520
Don't worry.

1751
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:09,700
I'll double tap this time.

1752
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:11,740
I swear.

1753
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:14,500
Don't worry, guys.

1754
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:15,440
I'll double tap.

1755
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:19,060
I've learned my lesson.

1756
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:21,600
Chat, I've learned my lesson.

1757
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:24,680
Alright.

1758
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:26,380
Now I know what to do.

1759
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:28,780
Nice.

1760
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:28,980
Okay.

1761
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:29,420
Got it.

1762
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:31,020
I got it.

1763
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:32,300
What?

1764
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:34,280
I totally dodged it!

1765
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:37,200
I 100% dodged that.

1766
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:38,540
I swear.

1767
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:41,340
Okay.

1768
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:41,900
Alright.

1769
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:43,220
They're all dead.

1770
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:45,920
I won't get one guy this time.

1771
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:48,760
See?

1772
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:49,600
I'm learning!

1773
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:52,640
I'm learning!

1774
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:54,880
I've learned!

1775
01:14:57,380 --> 01:14:58,640
I told you guys.

1776
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:01,140
I told you guys I can learn!

1777
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:05,020
Why did he let Matt hit him?

1778
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:05,840
Is he stupid?

1779
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,340
I'm double tapping!

1780
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:12,960
There you go.

1781
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:13,720
Easy.

1782
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:17,180
See?

1783
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:18,220
I told you I can learn!

1784
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,540
I told you guys!

1785
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:21,700
Alright.

1786
01:15:21,740 --> 01:15:22,660
Let me get rid of these guys.

1787
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:26,920
Dodge.

1788
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:27,400
Counter.

1789
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:30,080
Alright.

1790
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:30,700
Throw.

1791
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:31,860
Can I throw them actually?

1792
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:34,040
Oh my god!

1793
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:34,620
Look!

1794
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:36,020
I have a critical hit!

1795
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:38,080
I'm comboing!

1796
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:39,160
14!

1797
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:40,260
Ow!

1798
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:42,300
Oh shit!

1799
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:43,440
Nice.

1800
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:44,320
Alright.

1801
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:45,500
We're fine.

1802
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:47,440
Okay.

1803
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:47,940
We gotta get...

1804
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:48,460
Oh shit!

1805
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:48,980
Not the guns!

1806
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:50,800
Not the gun!

1807
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:54,300
Okay.

1808
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:55,400
We gotta get rid of him.

1809
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:58,200
And then punch him in the back.

1810
01:15:59,340 --> 01:15:59,740
Okay.

1811
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:00,520
I'm gonna get rid of him.

1812
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:02,500
Oh!

1813
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:05,860
Go!

1814
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:05,940
Oh my god!

1815
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:07,220
There's still so many!

1816
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:08,100
No!

1817
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:08,760
He's going for the gun!

1818
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:11,080
There's no gun for you!

1819
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:12,580
Okay.

1820
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,480
As long as there's...

1821
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:17,240
As long as he doesn't get the gun, we're fine.

1822
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:21,620
I just hope he... I just want him to not hold the gun.

1823
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:23,760
Alright.

1824
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:27,500
How many more are there?

1825
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:30,680
Woo!

1826
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:32,760
Okay.

1827
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:35,660
Last guy.

1828
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:37,420
Alright.

1829
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,160
Nice!

1830
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:41,520
I told you I can learn!

1831
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:45,720
I double attacked for real.

1832
01:16:57,740 --> 01:16:58,640
I did it!

1833
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:11,060
Maybe he just...

1834
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,540
Oh shit!

1835
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:14,820
Oh fuck!

1836
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:23,520
That's like a broken hand right there.

1837
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:26,020
Like he literally put explosives on his hand.

1838
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:27,320
Like what the fuck!

1839
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,120
Holy fuck!

1840
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:37,920
Yeah.

1841
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:38,720
Sorry, Barbara.

1842
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:39,960
I sort of...

1843
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:42,240
He got electrocuted several times.

1844
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:44,780
Because I kept getting one guy.

1845
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:54,100
And the Venom enhanced inmates are returning to normal.

1846
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,680
But what about the bones?

1847
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:58,300
The process can be quite painful.

1848
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:03,300
I'll survive.

1849
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:05,240
See you tonight, Barbara.

1850
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:07,260
Shame about your car.

1851
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:08,740
This is a big damage, Barbara.

1852
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:09,640
Thanks, Jim.

1853
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:10,840
But I have one on the way.

1854
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:12,060
Get some rest.

1855
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:13,540
You deserve it.

1856
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:17,970
Stay safe, Jim.

1857
01:18:18,190 --> 01:18:19,070
Two officers down.

1858
01:18:19,210 --> 01:18:21,190
The suspect is fleeing in their patrol car.

1859
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:31,000
Yeah.

1860
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:31,480
His arm...

1861
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:32,200
His hatchet.

1862
01:18:32,220 --> 01:18:33,080
That is definitely broken.

1863
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:34,360
Holy fuck!

1864
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:38,660
We did it!

1865
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:40,880
We beat Batman!

1866
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:43,220
Wait!

1867
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:45,440
I could have beat this game...

1868
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:48,600
I could have beat this game two days ago!

1869
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:49,940
In part three!

1870
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:51,820
You guys were like...

1871
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:54,060
Oh, it's gonna take her like...

1872
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:55,360
Two to three more hours.

1873
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:58,360
I could have literally played...

1874
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:00,340
An hour and we could have just...

1875
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:01,200
Beat the game.

1876
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:03,220
Two days ago.

1877
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,520
I can't believe it.

1878
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:10,620
I can't fucking believe it.

1879
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:14,020
What do you mean it almost took me two hours?

1880
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:15,280
It took me an hour!

1881
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:17,660
We had like 20 minutes of...

1882
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:18,900
In the beginning.

1883
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,140
I can't believe...

1884
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:26,180
You guys baited me into...

1885
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:27,480
Doing a part four.

1886
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:31,980
Holy shit!

1887
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:33,800
This game fucking...

1888
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:34,640
Oh my god!

1889
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:40,040
My PC was fucking crying while playing this game.

1890
01:19:40,660 --> 01:19:41,220
Anyway!

1891
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,000
Now that I finished...

1892
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:43,620
Batman!

1893
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:47,020
The next long game...

1894
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:47,760
The next series...

1895
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:49,340
Play through I'm gonna do...

1896
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:51,660

1897
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:52,720
Finally!

1898
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,900
I cannot wait to do the escort missions again.

1899
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:57,460
The rest of the game...

1900
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:58,480
Remastered.

1901
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:02,100
We're gonna do Resident Evil 4.

1902
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:03,420

01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:04,360
Our new play through.

1904
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:07,200
I wrote down a shitload of games.

1905
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:09,380
Is that the same fucking picture?

1906
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:10,780
Of Batman beating up a guy again?

1907
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:12,140
I swear I just saw this.

1908
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:13,200
Also Taurus!

1909
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:14,040
Thank you for the five!

1910
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:19,720

1911
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:20,740

1912
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:23,460

1934
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:59,240

1935
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:00,460

On like...

1937
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:05,800
Do they have the Minecraft Telltale series on the Xbox?

1938
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:07,060
Do they have it on the Playstation?

1939
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:08,880
Or is it an Xbox exclusive?

1940
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:11,000
Cause then I need to buy an Xbox.

1941
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:13,060

1942
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:14,760

1945
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:21,560
Is the Minecraft Telltale series...

1946
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:22,800
Only on Xbox?

1947
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:25,080
Cause like you can't get it online anymore.

1948
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:26,520
You have to... Yeah the story mode.

1949
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:28,420
Minecraft story mode.

1950
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:31,200
Because like I need to buy an Xbox then.

1951
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:32,300

1952
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:33,360

1954
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:39,120
Of the Minecraft story mode.

1955
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:41,540
Because it's so... I've never like...

1956
01:21:41,540 --> 01:21:43,380
I've never like played it before.

1957
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:45,620
But I've seen like videos of the...

1958
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:46,720
Of the pig dying.

1959
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:48,760

01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:57,340

You can't buy a digital copy of it anymore.

1966
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:04,320
You have to like buy the hard copy.

1967
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:05,860
Because it's like...

1968
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:06,220
Hahaha!

1969
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:09,360
It's like... It's like what's the word?

1970
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:11,360
They like took it out cause they wanna pretend...

1971
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:12,080
It doesn't exist.

1972
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:14,000
Hahaha!

1973
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,980
They... They wanna pretend...

1974
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:20,260
They never made a Minecraft story game.

1975
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:21,460

01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:25,280

For those who don't know.

1979
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:30,000
There's like an infamous scene where...

1980
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,800
The pig dying...

1981
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:32,880
Wait let me say I could find it.

1982
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:33,960
It's so fucking funny.

1983
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:35,420
It's actually...

1984
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:37,540
Watch the credits...

1985
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:38,700
Let's skip the credits.

1986
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:41,560
Is there an after credits scene?

1987
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:43,000
Oh there is an after credits scene!

1988
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:47,340
It's so good.

1989
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:49,020
I wanna like live through that.

1990
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:50,300
Watch this.

1991
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:54,180
Oh my god, Scarecrow, he's alive?

1992
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:55,500
Who would have thought?

1993
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:57,640
It's as if he never died.

1994
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:00,620
Alright, I need to show you guys.

1995
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:01,400
I need to show you guys.

1996
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:02,920
Let me get rid of this.

1997
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,400
All unsaved.

1998
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:05,480
Yes, I already finished the game.

1999
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:09,780
Okay, Minecraft...

2000
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:11,640
Pig...

2001
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:14,420
Story mode.

2002
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:16,940
It's so good.

2003
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:18,720
Look at...

2004
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:19,500
Wait, is this one?

2005
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:21,420
Okay, wait.

2006
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:22,720
Minecraft story mode.

2007
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:23,700
Reuben's death.

2008
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:26,140
Alright, here it...

2009
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:28,000
Sorry.

2010
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,840
It's so fucking funny.

2011
01:23:35,620 --> 01:23:36,280
Okay.

2012
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:37,980
Okay, this is the...

2013
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:39,540
This is what I'm talking about.

2014
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:44,380
I wanted to play the Minecraft story mode because of...

2015
01:23:44,930 --> 01:23:48,220
Because of this scene where the pig fucking dies.

2016
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:51,640
Because it's supposed to be like super fucking sad.

2017
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:53,280
And then he dies.

2018
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:56,500
And then he turns into fucking pork.

2019
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:01,580
Reuben!

2020
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:03,180
I don't know who you are!

2021
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:05,500
Reuben!

2022
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:07,940
Doki, please.

2023
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:09,440
Spoilers.

2024
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,480
This is the only thing I'll spoil.

2025
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:14,760
Because it's so fucking funny.

2026
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:19,440
It turns into fucking pork.

2027
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:21,180
Like, what the fuck?

2028
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:24,560
Holy shit.

2029
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:27,760
I remember thinking that was sad.

2030
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:30,080
Like, it's just a floating pork.

2031
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:31,340
Anyway.

2032
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,060
I wanna...

2033
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:35,660
Reuben will be remembered.

2034
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:39,200
Oh my god, he just picks up the pork chop!

2035
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:42,510
What the f...

2036
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:44,510
He's just picking up the pork chop!

2037
01:24:45,050 --> 01:24:47,650
Anyway, I really wanna play Minecraft story mode.

2038
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:48,670
Um, a little bit of...

2039
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:51,910
Okay, so yeah, like I said, I wrote down all these games I wanna play.

2040
01:24:52,290 --> 01:24:55,010
So, another one was Disney Dreamlight Valley.

2041
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:56,270
Which was the...

2042
01:24:56,270 --> 01:24:59,750
Which is basically the Animal Crossing of Disney.

2043
01:25:00,170 --> 01:25:01,970
Microsoft Flight Simulator.

2044
01:25:02,190 --> 01:25:03,490

2045
01:25:03,730 --> 01:25:04,990
DuckTales Remastered.

2046
01:25:04,990 --> 01:25:05,790
Dead Rising!

2047
01:25:05,910 --> 01:25:08,010
Okay, I've always wanted to try out Dead Rising.

2048
01:25:08,090 --> 01:25:09,410
I think Dead Rising would be really fun.

2049
01:25:10,210 --> 01:25:12,410
Crash Bandicoot Trilogy and Racing.

2050
01:25:13,130 --> 01:25:14,210
Tokyo Jungle.

2051
01:25:14,530 --> 01:25:15,450
Sleeping Dogs.

2052
01:25:15,990 --> 01:25:17,390
The original Kingdom Hearts.

2053
01:25:17,450 --> 01:25:18,150
Halo Infinite.

2054
01:25:18,670 --> 01:25:19,750
Or like anything from Halo.

2055
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:21,450
Sunset Overdrive.

2056
01:25:21,730 --> 01:25:24,770
And then I was watching Surefour play like Supermarket Simulator.

2057
01:25:25,470 --> 01:25:26,930
And then I was like, You know what?

2058
01:25:27,110 --> 01:25:29,110
I wanna know what it's like to be a...

2059
01:25:29,710 --> 01:25:31,230
To make minimum wage.

2060
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:39,290
I was watching Surefour play Supermarket Simulator for like...

2061
01:25:39,290 --> 01:25:39,810
I was watching Surefour play Supermarket Simulator for like...

2062
01:25:39,810 --> 01:25:41,310
Like I wasn't watching for 7 hours.

2063
01:25:41,490 --> 01:25:43,730
I watched like the last 2 hours of it.

2064
01:25:43,850 --> 01:25:47,950
And it's like that type of game where like you just turn off your brain and just like...

2065
01:25:48,670 --> 01:25:50,590
Turn off your brain and restock.

2066
01:25:51,510 --> 01:25:51,830
Um...

2067
01:25:53,330 --> 01:25:53,650
Anyway.

2068
01:25:53,650 --> 01:25:53,970
Kyle!

2069
01:25:54,210 --> 01:25:54,950

Thank you.

2072
01:25:56,490 --> 01:25:56,810
Uh...

2073
01:25:56,810 --> 01:25:59,910
PlayStation like Metal Gear.

2074
01:25:59,970 --> 01:26:00,590
Thank you for the super chat.

2075
01:26:00,650 --> 01:26:00,930

Thank you.

2077
01:26:01,790 --> 01:26:02,510
Dark Hunter.

2078
01:26:03,090 --> 01:26:03,690
Hey Doki.

2079
01:26:03,850 --> 01:26:06,250
Meant to become a member on my birthday this past Saturday.

2080
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:07,730
But better late than never.

2081
01:26:07,950 --> 01:26:08,230
Eh?

2082
01:26:08,390 --> 01:26:09,470
Love you and all the things you do.

2083
01:26:09,510 --> 01:26:10,250
Great stream so far.

2084
01:26:10,310 --> 01:26:11,150
Thank you for the super chat.

2085
01:26:11,210 --> 01:26:11,470
Thank you.

2086
01:26:11,490 --> 01:26:11,810
Thank you.

2087
01:26:11,810 --> 01:26:13,310
I'm glad you guys have been enjoying it.

2088
01:26:14,190 --> 01:26:19,990
But yeah, there's like... I've been like slowly writing down all the games that I wanted to play.

2089
01:26:20,810 --> 01:26:24,250
That I've been wanting to play like the past couple of years.

2090
01:26:24,590 --> 01:26:30,790
So like I'm like super excited to like try like eventually do everything on this list.

2091
01:26:31,150 --> 01:26:32,330
There's like... Oh my god!

2092
01:26:32,770 --> 01:26:37,730
I love how like people were like when they saw the Sonic game that I put for this week.

2093
01:26:37,870 --> 01:26:39,590
People were like Oh my god!

2094
01:26:39,630 --> 01:26:40,110
She's fun!

2095
01:26:40,210 --> 01:26:41,430
She's gonna be playing Sonic!

2096
01:26:41,610 --> 01:26:44,870
And then they read which type of Sonic I'm gonna be playing.

2097
01:26:45,230 --> 01:26:46,950
And everyone was like... Oh...

2098
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:49,650
It's that Sonic game!

2099
01:26:53,650 --> 01:26:55,130
That's so funny.

2100
01:26:55,390 --> 01:26:56,330
People were like...

2101
01:26:56,330 --> 01:26:57,330
Oh no!

2102
01:26:57,630 --> 01:27:01,570
The monkey paw is like... Doki's gonna play Sonic!

2103
01:27:01,830 --> 01:27:03,890
It's Sonic Dreams Collection.

2104
01:27:07,770 --> 01:27:08,450
Pikachu!

2105
01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:10,230
Thank you for the 50 gifted chips!

2106
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:10,770
Thank you!

2107
01:27:10,790 --> 01:27:11,470
Thank you!

2108
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:13,370
I really appreciate it.

2109
01:27:13,410 --> 01:27:14,170
Thank you so much!

2110
01:27:15,950 --> 01:27:16,630
Um...

2111
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:20,330
All you Zoomers and and uh...

2112
01:27:20,330 --> 01:27:27,590
Gen A, you guys were not... You guys never lived until you saw Sonic Dreams Collection.

2113
01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:32,250
Which is in my opinion, one of the best Sonic games out there.

2114
01:27:32,290 --> 01:27:34,150
I've never played Sonic Dreams Collection before.

2115
01:27:34,510 --> 01:27:38,430
I remember when it first came out and I seen like like a play through of it.

2116
01:27:38,690 --> 01:27:44,790
Um... And honestly, in my opinion, definitely one of the best Sonic games out there.

2117
01:27:44,950 --> 01:27:49,630
Did you guys know that the creators of Sonic Dreams Collection went on to create Neon White?

2118
01:27:53,170 --> 01:27:54,650
I think...

2119
01:27:54,650 --> 01:27:55,550
I think that's...

2120
01:27:55,550 --> 01:27:56,750
That's actually crazy.

2121
01:27:57,090 --> 01:28:01,570
That the creator of Sonic Dreams Collection made Neon White.

2122
01:28:01,870 --> 01:28:06,510
Like the jump between that to... This was the origin story.

2123
01:28:06,770 --> 01:28:10,590
The origin story of the devs of Neon White.

2124
01:28:11,010 --> 01:28:12,510
That's so... That's insane.

2125
01:28:13,250 --> 01:28:15,150
Um... And also Tattletale?

2126
01:28:15,730 --> 01:28:17,190
Like the Indie Horror Game?

2127
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:19,630
Uh... Indie Mascot Horror Game.

2128
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:21,950
Um...

2129
01:28:21,950 --> 01:28:22,550
Let's see.

2130
01:28:23,130 --> 01:28:24,490
DDragon, thank you for the superchat.

2131
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:25,230
Thank you, thank you.

2132
01:28:25,330 --> 01:28:27,270
Did somebody say Crash Team Racing?

2133
01:28:27,610 --> 01:28:28,990
I remember I talked about it before.

2134
01:28:29,130 --> 01:28:32,230
But I think Crash Team Racing is one of the best... Uh...

2135
01:28:32,230 --> 01:28:35,450
One of the best racing games out there.

2136
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:37,290
I like that more than Mario Kart.

2137
01:28:37,550 --> 01:28:38,810
I enjoy Crash...

2138
01:28:38,810 --> 01:28:40,830
Crash Bandicoot Racing more than Mario Kart.

2139
01:28:41,570 --> 01:28:42,950
Uh... Yeah, thank you for the superchat.

2140
01:28:43,010 --> 01:28:43,670
Thank you, thank you.

2141

Thank you, thank you.

2147
01:28:49,470 --> 01:28:50,630
We finished our first game!

2148
01:28:50,910 --> 01:28:52,290
We finished our first series!

2149
01:28:53,050 --> 01:28:53,930
I'm so happy.

2150
01:28:55,050 --> 01:28:55,410
Uh...

2151
01:28:57,730 --> 01:28:58,670
I'm so happy.

2152
01:28:58,830 --> 01:29:01,170
Our first series that we finished was Batman.

2153
01:29:02,390 --> 01:29:02,750
Um...

2154
01:29:02,750 --> 01:29:03,110

01:29:04,030 --> 01:29:04,790
Thank you, thank you.

2157
01:29:04,990 --> 01:29:06,770
Hey Doki, it was my birthday yesterday.

2158
01:29:06,910 --> 01:29:09,910
Thank you for being there and making me laugh for another year while I get old.

2159
01:29:09,990 --> 01:29:10,830
Thank you for the superchat.

2160
01:29:10,890 --> 01:29:11,690
Thank you, thank you.

2161
01:29:12,210 --> 01:29:12,570
Um...

2162
01:29:12,570 --> 01:29:13,290
Happy birthday.

2163
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:14,950
Happy belated birthday to you.

2164
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:17,190
Happy belated birthday to you.

2165
01:29:17,330 --> 01:29:19,510
Happy belated birthday dear Aipen!

2166
01:29:19,790 --> 01:29:21,550
Happy belated birthday to you.

2167
01:29:21,710 --> 01:29:21,970
Yeah!

2168
01:29:23,110 --> 01:29:25,770
Also Liam, thank you for the magenta superchat.

2169
01:29:25,770 --> 01:29:26,370
Thank you, thank you.

2170
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:28,410
It's one of the best Sonic games in my opinion.

2171
01:29:28,570 --> 01:29:29,490
I never played it.

2172
01:29:29,570 --> 01:29:30,630
Never changed.

2173
01:29:31,150 --> 01:29:31,710
Doki.

2174
01:29:32,050 --> 01:29:34,710
Thank you for the magenta superchat.

2175
01:29:34,970 --> 01:29:36,390
Thank you, thank you.

2176
01:29:37,630 --> 01:29:38,930
It's no problem guys.

2177
01:29:39,310 --> 01:29:43,310
I still think it's one of the best Sonic games out there.

2178
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:44,990
That's why you know it's good.

2179
01:29:45,550 --> 01:29:48,530
I've never played it but I think it's the best one.

2180
01:29:48,810 --> 01:29:50,910
That's when you know it's a really good Sonic game.

2181
01:29:51,010 --> 01:29:53,090
You don't have to play it to know it's like peak Sonic.

2182
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:54,270
Um...

2183
01:29:54,270 --> 01:29:56,230
Nexy, thank you for the Akasupa.

2184
01:29:56,350 --> 01:29:57,230
Thank you, thank you.

2185
01:29:57,710 --> 01:30:00,510
Super excited for you and all the fun games you have planned.

2186
01:30:00,790 --> 01:30:02,190
Congrats on finishing your first series.

2187
01:30:02,270 --> 01:30:02,750
Thank you!

2188
01:30:02,790 --> 01:30:04,250
Thank you for the Akasupa!

2189
01:30:04,490 --> 01:30:05,930
Thank you, thank you guys.

2190
01:30:06,470 --> 01:30:06,910
Yeah.

2191
01:30:07,670 --> 01:30:09,650
This was a very short stream.

2192
01:30:10,190 --> 01:30:10,630
Um...

2193
01:30:10,630 --> 01:30:13,650
I legitimately thought it would be a lot longer.

2194
01:30:13,850 --> 01:30:25,850
I mean to be fair, uh... to be fair like I did I feel like I was going... my PC was going through a lot like the last like uh two days ago.

2195
01:30:25,970 --> 01:30:26,570
It was going through a lot.

2196
01:30:26,610 --> 01:30:31,910
I was on fucking wifi and like my crashes was insane.

2197
01:30:32,330 --> 01:30:35,830
But like yeah we made it through.

2198
01:30:35,950 --> 01:30:37,390
We powered through guys.

2199
01:30:37,690 --> 01:30:39,250
We powered through.

2200
01:30:40,930 --> 01:30:43,370
Guys, I swear it's not a PC.

2201
01:30:43,610 --> 01:30:46,170
Okay, maybe it's a little bit of a PC issue.

2202
01:30:46,310 --> 01:30:46,610
Okay?

2203
01:30:46,690 --> 01:30:52,950
But like I swear guys it's not just my PC though.

2204
01:30:53,110 --> 01:30:55,090
It can't just be my PC.

2205
01:30:55,290 --> 01:30:59,250
There were more there was more at stake with the game.

2206
01:30:59,650 --> 01:31:00,490
Um... but yeah!

2207
01:31:00,650 --> 01:31:05,970
Anyway, I actually have a lot of behind the scenes work to do today.

2208
01:31:06,150 --> 01:31:07,590
So I'm gonna call it here.

2209
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:09,270
I really want to do as long as that's done.

2210
01:31:09,550 --> 01:31:13,670
But I have like a huge list of stuff to do for work today.

2211
01:31:13,870 --> 01:31:16,830
Um... because like it's never over.

2212
01:31:16,870 --> 01:31:18,190
Work is never over.

2213
01:31:18,430 --> 01:31:20,570
There's so many adult things to do.

2214
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:21,590
Oh my god.

2215
01:31:21,690 --> 01:31:26,650
Me and Mr. Man were talking about like payroll and stuff.

2216
01:31:27,090 --> 01:31:31,830
And like we were like negotiating pays and salaries and stuff.

2217
01:31:31,870 --> 01:31:34,250
And I was just like Oh my god.

2218
01:31:34,690 --> 01:31:35,670
Oh my god.

2219
01:31:37,390 --> 01:31:40,710
I had to open ANOTHER BITCH!

2220
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:46,060
I was like there's so much work to do.

2221
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:52,360
I just wanna stream Batman and be a silly anime girl.

2222
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:55,100
That's all I wanna do.

2223
01:31:55,600 --> 01:32:00,920
But I have to... I have to do so much adult things.

2224
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:08,300
Anyway, Araborninja, thank you for the super chat.
