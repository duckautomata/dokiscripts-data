1
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,780
Oh my god.

2
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,240
Sorry.

3
00:00:59,440 --> 00:00:59,580
Okay.

4
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,000
Whatever.

5
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:00,680
Okay.

6
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,040
Whatever.

7
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,020
The trailer first started.

8
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:02,300
Okay.

9
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:05,320
Hello.

10
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,660
I might sound weird.

11
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:07,120
Sorry.

12
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,920
The trailer started so I was like, oh fuck.

13
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:09,240
Okay.

14
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,960
We gotta watch this trailer.

15
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:14,440
Yeah.

16
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,120
So I'm sorry.

17
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,600
Do I sound okay?

18
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,460
I don't know.

19
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,220
I don't know.

20
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,180
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:22,680
Do I?

22
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:24,940
The audio.

23
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:25,360
Yes.

24
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,540
I am on a laptop right now.

25
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:36,080
I don't know if you sound very funny or this mic is not it.

26
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:36,560
Is it?

27
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,600
It's a very echoey area.

28
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,260
That's me.

29
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:48,740
Yeah.

30
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,240
All right.

31
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,920
I have no idea what's going on.

32
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:52,940
Yeah.

33
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,740
I sound like.

34
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,280
There's no way to fix this.

35
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,160
I'm not.

36
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,180
It's a bit tiny.

37
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,100
Do I need to slightly... Do I need to be louder?

38
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,760
It's beautiful as always.

39
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:10,380
All right.

40
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,340
What about the... Okay.

41
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,340
How about... Yeah.

42
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,440
It's very echoey.

43
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:17,840
I know.

44
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:18,840
Oh wait.

45
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,760
Is this Tetris?

46
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,240
This is... This is what they open with?

47
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,300
Tetris?

48
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,320
Okay.

49
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,580
I like how the opening for this is fucking Tetris.

50
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,240
But okay.

51
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,040
It's Tetris effect.

52
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,520
I know.

53
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,740
But I like how they open with Tetris of all games.

54
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,820
Like you know.

55
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,020
It's the first trailer.

56
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,720
And of course the first trailer is Tetris.

57
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,420
All right.

58
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,860
Let me put the alerts a little smaller.

59
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,040
I'm like a little bit scuffed right now.

60
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,440
Hello from A.S.

61
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,840
I'm Tsutsu Nuzuguchi.

62
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:57,880
I don't know.

63
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,020
I feel like you know.

64
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,540
The very first... The very first trailer should be not Tetris.

65
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,080
I don't know.

66
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,120
Is that just me?

67
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,000
I don't know.

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Is that just me?

69
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,600
I feel like if it's the first trailer it should be... I don't know.

70
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,720
Something more impressive than Tetris.

71
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,100
You always have to start with a...

72
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,180
Start with an insane thing and end with something even more insane.

73
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,000
It's a choice to open up with that.

74
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,720
That's for sure.

75
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,940
By the way, I'm not home.

76
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,280
If you guys can tell.

77
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,060
I am sort of traveling right now.

78
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,320
It is concert related.

79
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,000
That's why I was disappeared.

80
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,020
Thank you.

81
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,480
And enjoy the rest of State of Play.

82
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,320
All right.

83
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,120
SoundGuy.

84
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,560
I closed my Discord.

85
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,200
So like...

86
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,440
I don't remember... SoundGuy.

87
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,380
Just tell me in chat.

88
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,060
Like if there's anything I have to adjust.

89
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,420
Like my mic or my...

90
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,440
Or the audio of State of Play.

91
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,000
Let me know.

92
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,740
The future.

93
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,920
It isn't just a dream.

94
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,160
It's a promise.

95
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,000
Yeah, I'm not home.

96
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,560
That's why I sound really weird.

97
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,260
When we're turning into reality.

98
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,880
But what about the... the game capture?

99
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,020
Like the... the trailer.

100
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,280
Is the trailer okay?

101
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,960
An advanced generative AI.

102
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,160
Whoa.

103
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,700
We're reshaping the line between...

104
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,040
It's good?

105
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:23,560
Nice.

106
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,440
All right.

107
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,060
Can we turn up a bit?

108
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:27,400
Can we turn up a bit?

109
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,680
You're not sound yet.

110
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,940
What is this?

111
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,360
The fuck is this?

112
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,460
Oh, it's a bait.

113
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,520
Oh, it's a bait trailer.

114
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,860
No, it's bait.

115
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,940
There you are.

116
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,440
What?

117
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,280
All better.

118
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:01,600
Oh.

119
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,620
What's this?

120
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,080
Capcom!

121
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,480
Oh?

122
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,100
Hang on a second.

123
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,960
New Half-Life game from Capcom.

124
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,000
Capcom bought the rights of Half-Life.

125
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,360
This is Half-Life 3 now.

126
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,840
Oh, what the fuck?

127
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:30,740
Oh, what the fuck?

128
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,220
Targets identified.

129
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,300
Neutralizing threats.

130
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,960
Neutralize us?

131
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,220
Oh, shit.

132
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,280
Oh, shit.

133
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,140
I thought it's not live-service.

134
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:43,860
We're fine.

135
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:52,750
Pragmata.

136
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,250
I feel like we saw this trailer- a trailer for this before.

137
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,650
This is not the first time it got announced.

138
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,670
I remember seeing a trailer for this.

139
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:00,890
Yeah.

140
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,650
Yeah, a very long time ago.

141
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:06,910
It's very familiar.

142
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:08,850
Yeah.

143
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,750
Diana.

144
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,970
Hello, Diana.

145
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,230
Also, does sound guy ever talk?

146
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,050
Because I don't know.

147
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,990
Oh, it's real!

148
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,230
2026!

149
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,350
Let's go!

150
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,410
It's real!

151
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:34,590
It wasn't bait.

152
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:35,430
Like...

153
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,270
Uh...

154
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:36,830
Hollow Knight.

155
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,570
It's not Hollow Knight bait.

156
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,610
Oh, what?

157
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,070
Speaking of curry...

158
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,290
What is this?

159
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:50,470
Okay.

160
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,350
This looks...

161
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:52,650
This looks...

162
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,150
Like a very Japanese game.

163
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,430
No!

164
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,950
What the fuck?

165
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,930
What happened to him?

166
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,110
Did he eat his face?

167
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:06,870
Don't worry.

168
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,590
I made this just in case.

169
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,490
The Dead Gear life support system.

170
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,390
Don't move, okay?

171
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,830
What the fuck?

172
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,970
What the fuck?

173
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,870
What the fuck is going...

174
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,570
Excuse me?

175
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,210
What is going on?

176
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:22,350
Can we...

177
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,190
What?

178
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,050
Excuse...

179
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:27,370
Okay?

180
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,710
Okay, are we...

181
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,130
What are we playing as?

182
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,810
He's half dead man.

183
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:37,830
Oh,

184
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,830
he is dead man.

185
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,070
Is this new Pepsi man?

186
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,150
What the fuck?

187
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,090
Is this like...

188
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,990
The spiritual successor to Pepsi man?

189
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,230
Is this...

190
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,830
What the fuck is going on?

191
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,290
Dead man!

192
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,150
Definitely...

193
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:01,970
This is like...

194
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,770
2025's Pepsi man.

195
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,770
He he he he he he he he he.

196
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,010
You know what this reminds me of?

197
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,010
Lollipop chainsaw.

198
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,850
Dead man.

199
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:12,690
Woo!

200
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,710
This feels like lollipop chainsaw, but like...

201
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,630
But like, now he's dead man.

202
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:20,980
Yeah, it's like...

203
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,190
No more heroes.

204
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,110
Oh, that's true!

205
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,390
It does- You're right, no more heroes.

206
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,850
Maybe it's from the creators of no more heroes.

207
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,350
Romeo is a dead man.

208
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,030
He is a dead man.

209
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,070
Oh my god, we...

210
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,590
Guys, I told you guys.

211
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,210
We're getting more games on the PS5, guys.

212
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:40,230
We're in...

213
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,570
Oh my god, guys!

214
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:44,450
Finally!

215
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,190
Games!

216
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,070
On the PS5!

217
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,170
Finally!

218
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,040
Oh yeah, thanks.

219
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,760
Thanks, sound guy.

220
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,260
Great butt.

221
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,100
From Grasshopper Manufacturer.

222
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,620
Ha!

223
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,040
Hahahahahaha!

224
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,840
What did they make?

225
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,920
Suda...

226
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,980
uhh...

227
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,740
Suda51?

228
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,140
What games did they make?

229
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,080
Oh, it is No More Heroes!

230
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:20,820
Ohh!

231
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,320
He's an FBI Investigator?

232
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,460
Oh!

233
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,160
I knew it!

234
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,480
See, Lollipop Chainsaw!

235
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:42,420
I've never played Normal Heroes, but I've always seen so much about Lollipop Chainsaw, so I was like, oh my god, this reminds me so much of Lollipop Chainsaw.

236
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,300
There's so many games I want to play.

237
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:09,740
One of my friends tried to bribe me to play Hollow Knight, and then I was like, a thousand dollars, and they were like, oh that's alright, and I was like, per plate, like per part.

238
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,840
I was like, part one, a thousand, part two, a thousand.

239
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,720
Oh, is this the Silent Hill F?

240
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,280
This is Silent Hill F.

241
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,970
Can we pay you?

242
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,100
I want to play Hollow Knight eventually.

243
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:38,240
Um, I do want to play Hollow Knight, I just have so many games, and I want to play Hollow Knight when Silksaw announces release day.

244
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:46,600
I'll play it when Silksaw finally announces a release date, and it's not Bane.

245
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,880
So no Hollow Knight then.

246
00:10:53,500 --> 00:11:03,240
I was so surprised I made, um, a Silent Hill based in, uh, like outside of, you know, the town in America.

247
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,740
But it's a nice change of pace, you know?

248
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,920
It's a new setting too.

249
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,360
They're like, not in America this time.

250
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,360
Jesus.

251
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,680
And they're like, based off of more, like, J...

252
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,680
Oh my god, oh...

253
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,440
Look a game I'm not gonna play!

254
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:23,780
Look!

255
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,120
Oh, it does!

256
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,360
Um, what was it called?

257
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,300
The camera one?

258
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,200
Um...

259
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,580
Jesus, I don't like that.

260
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,480
I don't like that.

261
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,820
I- she reminds me of Grudge, and I don't like that.

262
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,660
I- no, no.

263
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,100
This gives me Grudge PTSD.

264
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,140
Fatal Frame, yeah!

265
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,480
She reminds me of the Fatal Frame protagonist.

266
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,830
I won't.

267
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,770
I- I would watch someone play it.

268
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,390
I- I don't think I'd play Silent Hill again for a while.

269
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:04,590
Oh my god, well...

270
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,190
I- I can't.

271
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:07,470
I- I- The...

272
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:11,290
The Silent Hill 2o Ren Master really fucked me up.

273
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,710
Ha ha ha ha!

274
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:17,790
It- Thank you for the 500 bitties!

275
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,810
Uh... Validica, thank you!

276
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,650
I'll play Silent Hill F when I hit a million subscribers.

277
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,270
I am not.

278
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,190
I can't.

279
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,450
I- Oh, I can't.

280
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:34,190
Oh, on a shrine temple too.

281
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:38,090
Oh, oh my god.

282
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,870
It's like, all my fears.

283
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,740
Oh, thank you for the thousand biddies building.

284
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:56,580
Thank you.

285
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,740
You traitor.

286
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,400
I can't.

287
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,380
This is like, all my fears.

288
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:10,860
The fact that some of these monsters are like, sort of look like the Grudge Girl, ain't it for me.

289
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,860
Oh my god.

290
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,340
That, oh my god.

291
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,840
I'm, like, Grudge is like the scariest movie for me.

292
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,040
Not even like the Japanese version of Grudge.

293
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,620
It is like the English NA version of Grudge.

294
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,680
It is for me, the most scariest game, like horror movie for me.

295
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,460
Because that was the movie that fucked me up the most growing up.

296
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,040
I couldn't take a normal shower for...

297
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,120
I literally changed the way I showered.

298
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,300
Because of Grudge.

299
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,480
Because when I first watched it, when my friends forced me to watch Grudge.

300
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,960
Um, because, uh, forced me to watch Grudge.

301
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,300
And, uh, and they did...

302
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,420
You know that scene where...

303
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,920
Oh, I never played Castlevania, too.

304
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,880
The scene where, like, her hand...

305
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,440
Uh, the hand comes out of the hair in the shower scene?

306
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:08,580
That was an actual perpetual fear of mine for the longest time.

307
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,420
Because I kept thinking a hand was gonna come out whenever I shower.

308
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,560
So I changed the way I showered.

309
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,540
So I never closed my eyes when I showered.

310
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,240
So what I do is I face away from the shower head.

311
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,640
And then I, like, tilt my head up.

312
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,700
And then so, like, it would...

313
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,900
Like, that's how I shower.

314
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,710
And then I also had to get my dog...

315
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,560
Not dad.

316
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,100
The dog...

317
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:30,420
My...

318
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,630
The dog before dad.

319
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,060
Or I say two dogs before dad.

320
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,120
I would, like, bring him...

321
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,920
His name was, uh, Bobo.

322
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,580
And I would bring him into the shower.

323
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,780
Like, into the bathroom.

324
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,640
So he could, like, guard me.

325
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,800
I had him guard me when I...

326
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,600
When I shower.

327
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,580
Because I...

328
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,280
I was like, alright.

329
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,440
If a ghost shows up, my dog will know.

330
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,100
He can detect the evil.

331
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,860
I don't know what he'll do.

332
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,580
I don't know.

333
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,820
He'll just let me know there's evil.

334
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,960
In my bathroom.

335
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,340
I don't know.

336
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,120
That's...

337
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,470
Oh, bloodstain.

338
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,390
What's bloodstain?

339
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,310
So you've come.

340
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,390
What is it?

341
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,750
What kind of game is bloodstain?

342
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,370
Oh, is...

343
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,590
Oh, Castlevania's accessing?

344
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:34,870
Oh.

345
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,310
It's Castlevania, but, like, blood.

346
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:43,590
What's this?

347
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,290
This situation here is critical.

348
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,310
Wouldn't it be crazy if we get a Kingdom Hearts announcement?

349
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,770
Oh, Digimon!

350
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,630
I fucking love Digimon.

351
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:54,810
Oh, that's so...

352
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:57,010
It's like Persona Digimon.

353
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:00,390
Oh, it's like CyberSluh.

354
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,570
Oh, it's like CyberSluh.

355
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:07,110
Yes, Digital fucking Monsters, you idiot.

356
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,390
It's like the most self-explanatory name.

357
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,710
It's Digital Monsters.

358
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:13,910
You guys.

359
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,430
We have been enemies for years now.

360
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,350
Fucking stupid child.

361
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,910
But this is the time the Titans have launched an attack on this case.

362
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,090
You dumbass.

363
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,630
You know, the most of the anomalies we can deal with stem from Digimon.

364
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:25,510
It seems the upcoming battle is truly unavoidable.

365
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,490
The world on this set is running out of time.

366
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:34,570
If the gate is opened with the digital world in such a state, the human world will most certainly be affected.

367
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:44,210
You know, I do like, I do like Digimon, but by God, their games are like, mostly un-streamable.

368
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:49,910
Like, it's, their games are mostly used to be enjoyed by themselves, I feel like.

369
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,510
The world tree has been attacked.

370
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:51,690
It is just as great.

371
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:56,370
None of their games are like, actually sort of streamable streamable.

372
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,190
We must protect the world from them.

373
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,630
For this purpose, and this purpose alone were you born.

374
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,230
If that thing opens, then we'll be swarmed by Digimon.

375
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:02,510
Attack!

376
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,210
Please, everyone, lend me your strength.

377
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:07,610
Spoken like someone who didn't play- I played Cyber Sleuth?

378
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:11,430
That game would take me months to complete on stream.

379
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:16,570
That- No, I have played Cyber Sleuth.

380
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,070
That's why I know.

381
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,190
Maybe years, even.

382
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:29,070
No, it's worse than Dynasty Warriors.

383
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,070
It's an actual JRPG.

384
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:32,050
It's-

385
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,740
that's me!

386
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:42,500
Look!

387
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,560
I'm, there's a chocobo!

388
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,900
I like the mini chocobo's.

389
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,620
The Cheapy chocobo's?

390
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,080
The Cheapy Chocobo's?

391
00:17:49,100 --> 00:18:06,080
I used to read the manga adaptation of the Cheapy Chocobo's, the Cheapy Chocobo's.

392
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,680
You know the Chibi Chocopo dungeon manga.

393
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:19,340
I used to read the serialization of that on the... I don't remember if it was Coco or Happy Dragon manga...uh...comic.

394
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,480
Whoa!

395
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,000
I never played Tactics.

396
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:30,200
I actually never... I told you guys, never grew up... I never grew up with Nintendo games or Final Fantasy games growing up.

397
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,940
Because my dad said it was for children.

398
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,340
Even though I was a child.

399
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,760
Even though I am also a child.

400
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,900
My dad was like, these games are for children.

401
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,340
You're not alone.

402
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,200
I'm not buying them.

403
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,480
Here's another meta.

404
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,380
Time to buy the next... Medal of Honor.

405
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,640
Like, fuck, the fifth Medal of Honor game.

406
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,640
Alright, child.

407
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,320
It's time to play Call of Duty.

408
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,180
Let's go.

409
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:14,960
I played a lot of Medal of Honor, Call of Duty, Battles, growing up.

410
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,960
Your dad teach you well.

411
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,920
My daughter is no Nintendo child.

412
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,980
When I first played it, I laughed so hard, I almost barfed.

413
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,120
Let's check it out.

414
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:30,900
What is that?

415
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,660
But is there... Is there... Just... Toilet?

416
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,360
Toilet?

417
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,120
Toilet?

418
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:35,880
What?

419
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,240
What?

420
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,120
Whenever it does... I laughed so hard, I almost barfed.

421
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,000
I feel like it might not be a funny game.

422
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,320
It might... might not be funny.

423
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:53,500
In baby steps, all you have to do is carefully place one foot in front of the other.

424
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,220
Which is easier said than done.

425
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,900
Is this a walking game?

426
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,220
Okay, that's a streamer game.

427
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,200
To make even the simplest progress.

428
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,680
Oh my god, it's like... Q-Op!

429
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,900
Q-Op on the console!

430
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,440
It's a rage game.

431
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:09,680
It's a rage game.

432
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,800
Without a map, the best toilet on the mountain.

433
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,600
Yeah, this is a Q-Op, yeah.

434
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,440
Another Q-Op flavor of the month game.

435
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,660
But guys, we get more games on the PS5!

436
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:21,360
Look!

437
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,360
Oh my god!

438
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,040
More games on the PlayStation 5!

439
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,920
Oh, that looks cute!

440
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,260
It's like, origami theme.

441
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,000
Can't wait to spend, like, what, how much is a PS5?

442
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,460
400 plus dollars to play, play a game called Baby Steps.

443
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,780
A nimble frog.

444
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,100
A hearty armadillo.

445
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:51,760
Awww!

446
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:52,800
That's cute!

447
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,100
And a powerful ape.

448
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,520
Awww!

449
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,030
Alright, his game is cute.

450
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,190
Monkey.

451
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:02,870
And he rechts a ninety- As a child!

452
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:03,970
On PS5 later this summer.

453
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:05,650
Ha.

454
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:06,090
So.

455
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:07,370
Ha ha ha ha.

456
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:11,390
We'll look at what the normal chatters are saying on the stream.

457
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,630
And it's like Bloodborne!

458
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,670
Where Bloodborne?

459
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,010
Bloodborne where?

460
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,150
Ha ha ha ha.

461
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,350
You just like...

462
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:27,450
It's like when you guys demand Soeksong on the Nintendos Direct.

463
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:28,610
Hahahaha!

464
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,430
Things never change.

465
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,870
For Sony, it's Bloodborne.

466
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,870
For Nintendo, it's so Sonic.

467
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,990
Yeah, with no release date.

468
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:53,110
You get like one to two seconds of that trailer, and then you're like satisfied for an entire year.

469
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,910
They're like, alright, we gave them two seconds.

470
00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:00,230
Now we can postpone it for one more year.

471
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,190
Oh, Ninja Gaiden.

472
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,810
We're simple creatures.

473
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:16,550
This is like a play, right?

474
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:18,870
Oh,

475
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:28,650
it's a new game?

476
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:34,690
Ninja Gaiden Ragebound arrives July 31st on PS5 and PS4.

477
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,850
You know, for Wi-Fi streaming, this is actually pretty good for Wi-Fi.

478
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,850
I'm very surprised.

479
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:46,730
I was so scared.

480
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:50,170
I lowered the bit rate so much.

481
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,910
Manage balance and stamina to discover secrets.

482
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:57,410
Oh...

483
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,730
Hey, wait for me!

484
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,130
Oh, do you know what she reminds?

485
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,310
You know what she looks like?

486
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,950
She looks like that girl from the...

487
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,410
Oh, what's her name?

488
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:10,410
Oh...

489
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:11,610
The...

490
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:12,630
The girl...

491
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,710
Oh my god, she's gonna die just like that game.

492
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:15,730
Mouthwashing!

493
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,810
Yeah, she looks like the lady from Mouthwashing.

494
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:20,590
You should try yourself with a demo that arrives later today.

495
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,230
I heard this game was fun.

496
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,490
It's like rock climbing, right?

497
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,950
A difficult game above that.

498
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,450
But there's still a lot of state of play to come.

499
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:36,010
This next reveal comes from the game preservationist at Digital Eclipse.

500
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,590
Nothing can prepare you for their next collection.

501
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,090
Arriving later this year.

502
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,990
We knew pretty early on that the game was fun to play.

503
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,430
People were excited about it.

504
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:51,410
The most rewarding part of it is just seeing people react to it.

505
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:53,670
Tree Fighter?

506
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:55,170
Oh.

507
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:58,210
What?

508
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,650
Mortal Kombat?

509
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,890
It was such a shock to see this game.

510
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,850
I was like, I can't believe this game exists.

511
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:09,810
Wait.

512
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,990
Oh, it's a collection.

513
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:15,150
Yeah, classic Mortal Kombat collection.

514
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,030
Oh, that's cool.

515
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,170
It became something that added to the mystique of Mortal Kombat.

516
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:18,650
Yeah.

517
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:23,830
We're showing you a part of a world that is much larger.

518
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:25,730
I mean, that's nice.

519
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,850
You don't need an emulator and stuff.

520
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,010
We're gonna actually make money off of people.

521
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:33,490
Nintendo.

522
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,510
That's my issue.

523
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:44,830
Like, Nintendo could easily just, you know, bring out more classic games slash collections.

524
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,330
It's a bit of the wild west.

525
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,110
So, you know, make money.

526
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:52,730
Every part of that game is an expression of who we were and what we wanted.

527
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:55,670
Instead of, like, vaulting it forever.

528
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,000
Like...

529
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:05,630
Like...

530
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,190
Yeah, but they could easily...

531
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:11,890
Okay, but they're using so much of that money suing random people.

532
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:12,910
Like...

533
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:16,850
Especially...

534
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,450
Especially emulators.

535
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,030
Like...

536
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,950
You know what can...

537
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,950
What can help stop emulation?

538
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,290
If they release the games.

539
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:29,130
On the modern console.

540
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:30,390
That's...

541
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:33,730
Wait, the first fight stick made by PlayStation?

542
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,030
Oh, shit.

543
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,190
That's cool.

544
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,020
Not all the classics.

545
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,780
And they sometimes put it on, like, limited time.

546
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,760
Oh, hey, Metal Gear.

547
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,500
Ha!

548
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:54,760
That's cute.

549
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,420
Oh, shit.

550
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,140
Metal Gear.

551
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,860
Sorry if I don't have, like, a bigger reaction to Metal Gear.

552
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,820
I have zero...

553
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,220
Never played Metal Gear before in my life.

554
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,180
Other than the...

555
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,020
One with...

556
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,660
The metal...

557
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,600
The robot guy.

558
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,280
React now!

559
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,020
Oh, there's that guy.

560
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,180
Snake.

561
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,180
Snake.

562
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:19,440
Socket.

563
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:21,160
Ha!

564
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:21,580
Ha!

565
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,520
Ha!

566
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:26,420
Ha!

567
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:26,740
Ha!

568
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,020
Ha!

569
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,380
Ha!

570
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,040
Ha!

571
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,510
Don't let it in here.

572
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:35,930
React hard!

573
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,390
Oh, my God!

574
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,790
It's Metal Gear Solid!

575
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:41,090
Did that say 4?

576
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:45,530
Oh, it's the monkeys, it's the PlayStation monkeys!

577
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:45,950
Monkeys!

578
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,350
Oh, so cute!

579
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,190
Oh my god!

580
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:53,870
Is it crazy I reacted harder to the monkeys than I did to Solid Snake.

581
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,530
It's the monkeys!

582
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,650
Oh my god!

583
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,590
It's Ape, it's game!

584
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,630
Let's let it go!

585
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:07,490
Oh, now that's a good... Oh my god.

586
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:10,070
Now that... I guess the game is good now.

587
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:15,310
I... I...

588
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,190
Monkey... Monkey over snake.

589
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,850
See, now I care!

590
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:28,290
Shining stones imbued with human kinds never-ending dreams.

591
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:29,410
Oh!

592
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:30,850
Koei Tecmo!

593
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,070
Since time immemorial...

594
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:33,590
What game is this?

595
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:38,310
This power has been the impetus for human wars.

596
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:42,750
Oh?

597
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:44,750
Is this Mio?

598
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,890
I've always wanted to play Mio!

599
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,870
Such an ominous atmosphere...

600
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:52,370
Oh!

601
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,190
There's so many games I want to play!

602
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:55,650
Fuck!

603
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:57,950
I want to play Mio too!

604
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,610
I've always wanted to play it.

605
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,610
I've never had time to.

606
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,410
Bloodborne!

607
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:05,330
Hahahaha!

608
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:07,910
Guys!

609
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:08,970
Guys!

610
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:09,070
Guys!

611
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,030
My monitor's off!

612
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,630
Can someone tell me if Bloodborne is coming out yet?

613
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:13,890
Hahahaha!

614
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,090
Here is my answer!

615
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,410
Oh my god!

616
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,470
It's Bloodborne!

617
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,640
Alright, do I skip Mio 1 to play Mio 2?

618
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,880
Does my...

619
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:29,860
Guys!

620
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,640
If you squint hard enough, it could technically be Bloodborne!

621
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:33,960
Hahahaha!

622
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:34,760
Guys!

623
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,100
I was like, Bloodborne 2!

624
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:36,840
Let's go!

625
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,100
Hahahaha!

626
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:41,260
Hahahaha!

627
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:41,340
Hahahaha!

628
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:41,360
Hahahaha!

629
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,500
So much to Chow is like, Oh my god!

630
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,460
Bloodborne 2!

631
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,740
To have entered the...

632
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,440
Depths of Hell!

633
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,120
Hahahaha!

634
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,260
There's blood in the...

635
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:53,960
Technically...

636
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,820
Technically...

637
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,030
Who might you be worried?

638
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:01,710
Hahahaha!

639
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:02,630
Sekiro 3!

640
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:03,630
Hahahaha!

641
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:04,990
Tokugawa...

642
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,510
Takechiyo...

643
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:07,830
Whoa!

644
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,110
I...

645
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,790
I have no context with that name.

646
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:12,630
Hahahaha!

647
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:14,530
Konnichiwa!

648
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:14,970
Hello!

649
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:15,870
Konnichiwa!

650
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:16,750
Hello!

651
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:18,250
Konnichiwa!

652
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:23,630
He said the name!

653
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:24,390
I'm like, who?

654
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:25,250
Hahahaha!

655
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:29,730
Oh!

656
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:30,030
Oh my god!

657
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,370
Is that Jason Bloodborne?!

658
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:32,570
Whoo!

659
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:34,530
Open fields!

660
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:39,150
John-nito!

661
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:40,330
Hahahaha!

662
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:51,530
Yay!

663
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:51,750
Yay!

664
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,790
Oh, it's exclusive to PS5.

665
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,130
Don't worry.

666
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:57,030
Oh, they're demo available today!

667
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:57,930
Wow!

668
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:00,830
Today!

669
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:04,310
Guys, quickly, download it now on your PS5.

670
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,450
All five of you.

671
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:09,210
The five of you that actually owns a PS5.

672
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,570
A Blood Boy?

673
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,890
Is this Blood Boy cast?

674
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:24,270
Free to take whatever I need.

675
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,970
Oh my god, it's Medivh.

676
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:28,170
Oh my god, VR Blood Boy?

677
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,270
Is this...

678
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:42,660
It's like when they announced Batman Arkham Asylum, an Arkham game for Batman, and then it was like, JK, it's VR.

679
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:48,120
How pissed off would you feel if they announced Blood Boy but it's in VR?

680
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,500
I can't even imagine.

681
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,880
It's just like the Batman Arkham series.

682
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,700
There would be riots.

683
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,740
Come with more trouble than others.

684
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,820
I can't... So it's like, I can finally hug her.

685
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,120
Yeah, there's some... There's some people out there.

686
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,600
There's two types of people.

687
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,960
One that will be mad.

688
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,920
The other one would be like, finally, I can hug my waifu.

689
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,800
Oh, it's Pieth.

690
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,380
I have no idea what that means.

691
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,520
Boo!

692
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,980
Oh, is this... Is this some Nautica?

693
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,040
Makers of Road 96.

694
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,700
What's that?

695
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,080
Oh.

696
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:42,960
Oh.

697
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:50,820
The guy.

698
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,350
A multiplayer story?

699
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,200
Oh, no.

700
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,840
This might not go well.

701
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,840
This is the guy.

702
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,720
You know what that reminds me of?

703
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,200
That time loop game that died so fucking fast.

704
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,560
Yes.

705
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,300
Yeah, this reminds me of the same concept.

706
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,600
Choose... Oh, I'm gonna follow the rock.

707
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,060
Okay.

708
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,520
This game...

709
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,500
This reminds me of definitely...

710
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,040
This game will be alive for one week.

711
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,820
And it will be so fun for one week.

712
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,260
And then after that...

713
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,640
Like...

714
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,420
After that...

715
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,580
It's not gonna end.

716
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,080
One week is too fun.

717
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,820
I feel like...

718
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,480
So many people are gonna fuck with you.

719
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,880
Yeah, it's gonna be a streamer game.

720
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,440
For one week only.

721
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,280
On the... Especially if it's on the PS5.

722
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:55,980
Okay, you're right.

723
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,040
One week was too generous.

724
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,620
For three days.

725
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,060
Okay.

726
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:04,720
I...

727
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,440
I realized it said on...

728
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,020
Exclusive on the PS5.

729
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,240
For three days.

730
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,500
For the last few months it has been in the world of Astro.

731
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,520
Astro Bot launched last September.

732
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,060
To search encouraging feedback.

733
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,740
Even receiving a few others...

734
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,080
Oh!

735
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,340
I wanna play this one too.

736
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,020
I think this game is really fun.

737
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,900
Astro Bot.

738
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,140
What?

739
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,500
Aww.

740
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,880
Way to do updates to it.

741
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:29,680
That's cute.

742
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,140
Adding yet more new challenging levels.

743
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,780
All of which came at no additional cost.

744
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:44,280
And today, I am pleased to announce that later this month, you will be able to enjoy five brand new challenge levels in Astro Bot.

745
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,760
For free?

746
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:46,460
For free?

747
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,280
I love free stuff.

748
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:52,340
New special bots will be there too, including Atsu from Ghost of Yotei.

749
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,720
Alongside other fans' favorites.

750
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,380
But these ones are a surprise.

751
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,240
There's a fox.

752
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:02,760
And finally, the Astro Bot DualSense wireless controller will return later this year.

753
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,820
With a slight twist.

754
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,960
Wait, it has the eyes!

755
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:11,980
From all of us, Apti Masobi, thank you all for the amazing reception you gave our game.

756
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,280
And enjoy the rest of the show.

757
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:14,660
Oh my god!

758
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:15,840
Wait!

759
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,540
That's actually so cute because the eyes.

760
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,420
Yeah, they jingle jangled for me.

761
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,740
They're like, jingle jangle jangle!

762
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,880
Look at this controller!

763
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,940
Jingle jangle jangle!

764
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,460
They'll be like, oh my god.

765
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,900
Sea remnants.

766
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,000
Don't you react!

767
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,960
That's not true, I reacted to the monkeys too.

768
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:46,440
I just never played another gear.

769
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,500
I can't say.

770
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,420
What is this?

771
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,380
Is this Monkey Island?

772
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,500
He looks like Monkey Island.

773
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,420
They're on an island.

774
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,860
Is this?

775
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,380
Is this like, um, what's it called?

776
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,180
Um, oh my god!

777
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:07,880
Action?

778
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,920
Action Monkey Island?

779
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,980
Wait, there's no way!

780
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,740
There's a lot of pirates.

781
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,060
Pirates slash, uh, pirate type games.

782
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,510
Oh my god!

783
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:36,910
Too hot!

784
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:38,810
Oh my god!

785
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:39,410
You're dead!

786
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:44,290
Too hot!

787
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:47,910
It's skull and bones too!

788
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:52,790
Wait, is he made of wood?

789
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:55,910
Is that Pinocchio?

790
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,770
Wait, they're all made of wood!

791
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,270
Arcane?

792
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,110
Oh, they restart!

793
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:05,270
Oh, they restart!

794
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,110
Oh, is it Roguelike?

795
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:08,290
Wait, they're restarting the journey.

796
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:09,530
It's a loop.

797
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,180
Oh, it's literally called Sea Remnants.

798
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,400
Oh, I thought that was the developer name.

799
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,560
Usually they don't show the name of the game at the beginning.

800
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,540
So, I...

801
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:26,700
Oh!

802
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:27,700
Scarf!

803
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,760
Oh wait, no, nevermind.

804
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,300
Wait, are those the Scarf people?

805
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,200
And, yeah, Journey!

806
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,180
The Scarf people.

807
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,660
Journey was such a cute game.

808
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,470
Yeah.

809
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,230
I was like, I recognize the...

810
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:47,890
Um...

811
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:50,210
I recognize, like, the...

812
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:50,650
Atmos...

813
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:51,710
Like, the...

814
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,910
The atmosphere and aesthetic.

815
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:58,950
Aw!

816
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,350
Aw, it's so cute!

817
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:04,670
Yeah.

818
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:25,490
Where are my people that help me travel?

819
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,510
Oh my god.

820
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:31,330
Nice.

821
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:31,530
Nice.

822
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,550
Nice flip.

823
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:37,770
What is it called?

824
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:38,970
Tony Hawk?

825
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,710
Tony Hawk Journey.

826
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:43,030
Wicked.

827
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,530
Journey with...

828
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:44,790
Yeah, Tony.

829
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:45,950
Sick flip!

830
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,020
Sad Hawk.

831
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,580
Tony Hawk's Journey to the West.

832
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,360
Hi everyone, I'm Kristin Zutani.

833
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,940
That was a new look at Sword of the Sea, a visually striking adventure from the team behind Abzu, and the Pathless.

834
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,240
That's cute.

835
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,680
We're excited to announce that Sword of the Sea will launch this summer into the PlayStation Plus game catalog.

836
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:10,100
Oh!

837
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:13,080
Wait, that means it's free if you have the PlayStation Plus catalog.

838
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:17,940
On June 17, Remedy brings otherworldly action to game catalog with FBC Firebreak.

839
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:28,760
In this cooperative FPS set in the Paranatural World of Control, you and two fellow agents must confront and contain the reality warping chaos found within the oldest house.

840
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:36,500
Fun in short bursts or deep dives, FBC Firebreak launches day one in the game catalog on June 17.

841
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,080
Okay, so that means you have to subscribe to it to even access these games, right?

842
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,080
The PlayStation Plus Classics catalog welcomes several new titles this summer.

843
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:48,680
The PS2 version of legendary immersive sim Deus Ex?

844
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760
Oh!

845
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:49,920
Deus Ex?

846
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,360
Oh my god!

847
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,460
Twisted Metal!

848
00:38:54,740 --> 00:39:05,360
In July, Twisted Metal 3 and Twisted Metal 4 join the service just in time for the second season premiere of Twisted Metal, which arrives July 31st in select countries, including Peacock in the U.S.

849
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:10,220
Additionally, two of Capcom's most beloved games from the original PlayStation are set to join the console.

850
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,280
Could they use Ex on the controller?

851
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:13,740
Hmmmm...

852
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,900
Oh my god!

853
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,380
Okay, Resident Evil 3 Nemesis was actually my nightmare.

854
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,980
That was the game that my dad would make me watch and play.

855
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:28,060
I, like, have, like, flashball PTSD memories of Nemesis breaking through the window.

856
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:34,280
Days of Play is a two-week event that includes bonus PlayStation Plus content drops, great deals on software and hardware, and more.

857
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,120
Visit PlayStation Blog and PlayStation.com.

858
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:41,380
No, I will live with that drama for the rest of my life.

859
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,680
His parents cut their own rope to save him.

860
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,280
He watched them fall, then found his way off that mountain.

861
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,180
He was 11 years old.

862
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:51,500
He was 11 years old.

863
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,860
Thank god it's not all CGI.

864
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,640
He started a grand tour of every major boarding school.

865
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,740
He was always at the top of his class.

866
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,020
Two Raiders?

867
00:39:59,460 --> 00:39:59,960
Two Raiders?

868
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,780
There is a James Bond.

869
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,040
His superiors all praise his instincts.

870
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,020
Is this James Bond?

871
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,040
Nobody knows what to do with him, Mom.

872
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:09,100
No.

873
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,640
This is where we get it just elbow.

874
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,100
Ha Ha Ha.

875
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:12,960
Heh.

876
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:13,800
Heh heh.

877
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,220
I see him.

878
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,860
All right but Which Bond.

879
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,300
It was ill disciplined, utterly reckless.

880
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:21,940
WIH means God.

881
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,980
Which Bond is it?

882
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,740
Give me one good reason to put him in a- Johnny English.

883
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,440
The Bond word?

884
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:34,600
Bond word ?是 a bullet without a target.

885
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,620
Let's give him one.

886
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,660
Tom Hanks?

887
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,660
What the fuck?

888
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,020
Okay, he looks like the guy from...

889
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:50,780
Tom Cruise.

890
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,660
Sorry, Tom Cruise?

891
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,320
Sorry, Tom Cruise?

892
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,620
One of the Toms.

893
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,640
This is Twain.

894
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,660
That guy looks just like Tom Cruise.

895
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,800
Sorry, I got the Toms.

896
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,040
No, it looks like the guy from...

897
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:06,940
Just Cause.

898
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,100
What?

899
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,520
Tom Cruise.

900
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,020
Yeah, it looks like...

901
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,200
It looks like the Just Cause guy?

902
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,320
Or...

903
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,280
Or Tom Cruise.

904
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:25,670
Or Uncharted.

905
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:26,710
Uncharted.

906
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:27,850
Sorry, Uncharted.

907
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:29,590
I'm mixing everything up.

908
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:31,570
The Uncharted guy slash Tom Cruise.

909
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:35,110
Someone was like Peter Parker.

910
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:38,810
Wait does!

911
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:40,870
Wait does look like Tom Holland!

912
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:42,270
It's all the Toms!

913
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:44,230
It looks like Tom Holland!

914
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:47,370
Oh my god, it's like Tom Holland if he like...

915
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,170
Like grew up a little bit.

916
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,570
It's all the Toms.

917
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:57,090
The Tom Fusion.

918
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,070
Wait I see it!

919
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:58,730
I see it!

920
00:41:58,810 --> 00:41:59,130
I see it!

921
00:41:59,130 --> 00:41:59,670
I see Tom Holland!

922
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:02,130
I see Tom Holland and I see Tom Cruise.

923
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:03,970
I see Uncharted.

924
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,860
If all the Toms had a baby.

925
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,680
It will turn into James Bond.

926
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,940
John Tom is real!

927
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,060
Bum, bum,

928
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:24,440
bum, ba-da-da!

929
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,040
Oh my god, it's a classic.

930
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,860
I suppose this is another teachable moment.

931
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,280
Idris Elba?

932
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,900
Is that just Elba next to him?

933
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:38,180
Oh my god, it's the golden gun!

934
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,900
You get the gold gun!

935
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,640
Tom squared.

936
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:44,700
Names Bond.

937
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:45,680
Tom Bond.

938
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,200
Hello, I'm Hakan Abrak, CEO of Iron Tracks.

939
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,800
That's so cool, you get the golden gun.

940
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,840
The one shot gun.

941
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,500
The one shot gun.

942
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,920
You'll experience James Bond as a young air crewman in the Royal Navy.

943
00:42:59,160 --> 00:42:59,960
No, do you see it?

944
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,260
It looks like Tom Cruise.

945
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,700
It looks just like him.

946
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,640
You see that smile, you know that?

947
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:11,560
You know that smile he always does in his fucking Mission Impossible films?

948
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,600
It is him!

949
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:20,020
Harnessing our 25 years of agent expertise.

950
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,180
This is just the beginning of our journey with 007.

951
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:27,040
And we can't wait to share more with you.

952
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,520
That crazy Scientology smile!

953
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,360
You see it, you see it in the smile.

954
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:46,380
Oh wait, that's the...

955
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,060
What is it?

956
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:48,520
The sequel.

957
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:49,400
The other samurai...

958
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,220
The other samurai sequel.

959
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:53,840
Uh...

960
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,580
Ghost of Yote.

961
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,060
Yeah, there's so many.

962
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,060
You know, the other...

963
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,760
No, no, no, not that samurai sequel.

964
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,880
The other...

965
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,140
No, no.

966
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,300
Not only Musha 3.

967
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,320
The other one.

968
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,660
No, no not Nioh3.

969
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,860
The other samurai game.

970
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,300
No, no, no.

971
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:11,660
No, not the new... Not Sekiro.

972
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,760
That samurai game.

973
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,920
The Ghost of Yote.

974
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,080
How many of these games are there?

975
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:24,000
There's apparently, surprisingly, a lot of samurai games.

976
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,100
A lot of recently released samurai games.

977
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:31,420
Whoa.

978
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:36,000
That's a good dog.

979
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,420
Guys, did you know that Minecraft movie is now out on digital download?

980
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,100
I know what.

981
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,600
I'm watching your members.

982
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,380
I'm gonna make you all pay $20.

983
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,700
It's 20.

984
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,700
Guys, it's only $20 to rent.

985
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,380
Don't you fucking dare watch the non-CGI.

986
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,420
The one without the CGI.

987
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,100
That is a good... What the fuck?

988
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,260
This is not marble, right?

989
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,920
What is this?

990
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,220
What?

991
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:20,860
What?

992
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,020
What?

993
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,320
Wait, what?

994
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,200
Wait, is this...

995
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:31,320
What?

996
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:33,440
Oh, my...

997
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:33,780
Is this...

998
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,160
Marbles versus Capcom?

999
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:38,400
But, like, is it just all marbles?

1000
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,400
They just removed Capcom?

1001
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:50,030
It's just... yeah.

1002
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:51,650
Marbles versus Capcom.

1003
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,630
Wait, that looks... I like...

1004
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:55,950
Wait, that looks...

1005
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:55,950
I like...

1006
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:56,530
Oh, my God.

1007
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:58,670
Wait, that's Star-Lord?

1008
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:02,190
Wait, that's Ghost-riding?

1009
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:03,750
Wait, that's Ghost-riding?

1010
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:04,950
Oh, my...

1011
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:08,110
Okay, I'm gonna say the designs, you really... I like the designs.

1012
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:09,270
Yeah, baby!

1013
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:12,410
Okay, the design...

1014
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:13,290
Oh, my God!

1015
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:17,180
Okay, not gonna lie...

1016
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:18,120
These designs...

1017
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:20,490
These designs...

1018
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:20,890
These designs...

1019
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:21,210
Fuck.

1020
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:25,050
Dr. Doom...

1021
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:25,310
Oh, my God.

1022
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:27,090
I love, like, people were, like...

1023
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:28,130
Wait, but Dr. Doom...

1024
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:30,470
All Dr. Doom wanted was, like, real...

1025
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:31,430
In general.

1026
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:33,650
Like, he...

1027
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:36,210
There was, like, an alternate universe where Dr. Doom succeeded...

1028
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:40,290
And, like, he actually created a really, really good government.

1029
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:42,630
And, like, um...

1030
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:43,970
A good gov...

1031
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:44,710
What the fuck?

1032
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:45,770
4v4?

1033
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:47,470
What the fuck?

1034
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,410
Oh, my God!

1035
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:50,770
Yeah, I love...

1036
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:51,710
I love the designs.

1037
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:52,390
Oh, my God.

1038
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:53,230
Mecha...

1039
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:54,650
Mecha Iron Man.

1040
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,640
So, there's, like, an alternate universe, um...

1041
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:07,420
Where he, like, actually won and, like, succeeded in, like, becoming, like, the...

1042
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:09,760
The president of the entire fucking world.

1043
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:10,520
And...

1044
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,460
But then he actually created a good government.

1045
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:15,480
And, like, people actually were, like, um...

1046
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,320
There's no war or whatever or something.

1047
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:18,340
And then...

1048
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:21,440
And then the Fantastic Four was, like, I don't like this!

1049
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,120
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1050
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,860
Marvel token fighting souls.

1051
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:26,980
That shit looks really good!

1052
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:27,640
But...

1053
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,540
And then Fantastic Four came in and was, like, Wait, this is wrong!

1054
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,340
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1055
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:42,090
Peace unacceptable!

1056
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:44,630
Wait, why did they rewind that?

1057
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:49,270
Yeah, I got confused.

1058
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:50,530
Why was there a rewind?

1059
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,040
Yeah, I got confused.

1060
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:10,440
Why was there a rewind?

1061
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:11,700
Oh, is this Yakuza?

1062
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:12,300
Marvel?

1063
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:23,540
No, these are the guys that created a Marvel fighting game.

1064
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,680
It's still about the Marvel fighting game.

1065
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,580
It's just the dev commentary.

1066
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,220
Oh, he looks cool!

1067
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:34,840
Woah!

1068
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:38,440
I really like the designs.

1069
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:40,960
I think the designs actually cool.

1070
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:46,900
I think Mecha Iron Man, that vaguely resembles Gundam, is a good choice.

1071
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,320
Oh my god!

1072
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,900
The inspiration for working on this project...

1073
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,680
The fucking Gundam Iron Man!

1074
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,320
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1075
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,400
And wanting to say, why isn't PlayStation in this space?

1076
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,020
So PlayStation...

1077
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:58,940
Yeah, Mecha Iron...

1078
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,340
...to bring Marvel back to the forefront of the tag fighting genre.

1079
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:11,020
And that got us really excited because we had worked with them before on successful stuff like the Marvel Spider-Man franchise with Insomniac.

1080
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:20,560
When it came to approaching Marvel, you have to kind of first float the idea and let them know, Hey, you know, we're thinking about approaching a company like Arc System Works to make a fighting game.

1081
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,900
We'd love to partner with you to do this really great collaboration.

1082
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:25,000
Would you be interested?

1083
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,440
When they named the developer, that really perked up our ears.

1084
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:33,960
It's always refreshing to work with a team that will take on the challenge of tackling Marvel, putting their own spin on it.

1085
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,600
And they're just uppercutting that challenge into the stratosphere.

1086
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,400
And that's what you get with this team.

1087
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:40,720
I mean, they couldn't make something boring if they tried.

1088
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,500
Marvel is actually like monopolizing the gaming sphere now.

1089
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,200
So now it's Heal Shooters.

1090
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:53,400
Heal Shooters, fighting games, they're coming back to MOBA.

1091
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,460
They're coming back.

1092
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,660
They're gonna make another MOBA game.

1093
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,640
They're gonna hit up Riot and be like, make us a MOBA game.

1094
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,740
But like, not fail.

1095
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:07,540
Because you either do something like this big and bold, or you don't do it at all.

1096
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:10,400
They're gonna be like, Riot, we need you.

1097
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:11,940
The Prophecy.

1098
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:15,600
Yeah, and it failed, didn't it?

1099
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:18,480
They took over TCG.

1100
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,060
They took over the TCG with Marvel Snap.

1101
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:24,180
They took over hero shooters.

1102
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,980
Now they're trying to get into fighting games.

1103
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:34,600
And now they're gonna contact Riot and be like, we need to complete our Infinity Stones.

1104
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:40,380
Can't wait for the tactical shooting.

1105
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,760
MOBA is endgame.

1106
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:44,300
Yeah.

1107
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:50,620
Marvel vs.

1108
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,020
Capcom without Capcom.

1109
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,120
How did this happen?

1110
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:55,920
It's easy.

1111
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,460
Marvel makes more money than Capcom.

1112
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:01,460
They don't need Capcom anymore.

1113
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,900
They have enough money to be like, delete.

1114
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,220
I mean, they still have a deal.

1115
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:22,400
Oh my god.

1116
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,000
I love this suit.

1117
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,440
That suit actually... actually is fucking cool.

1118
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,180
One of the mantras that we have for this project is...

1119
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:30,600
2XKO?

1120
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:32,580
Yeah, that's gonna be interesting.

1121
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,600
Not just the IP, but gameplay mechanics and say, what can we really...

1122
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,020
I don't know.

1123
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:37,780
I feel like Riot can pump enough money.

1124
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:40,860
It just depends on who... which game releases first.

1125
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:48,160
Okay, but to be fair, Riot has enough money to keep a game alive.

1126
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:57,140
They have enough money to make sure a game does not die.

1127
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:00,200
It's also the gameplay mechanics and adding in that... what is that pop?

1128
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,700
What is gonna be something that's different?

1129
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:07,440
Up until now, you've seen tag fighters that have 2XKO at least has a year before the Marvel game comes out.

1130
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,300
I feel like we just had to go 4v4.

1131
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:16,900
And in doing so, we found a lot of unique and fun ways to change up the gameplay that I think players are gonna be very excited to see.

1132
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,260
Jesus fucking Christ.

1133
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:23,460
That has a lot of people on my screen.

1134
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,180
Oh my god, that moves to look so cool.

1135
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:28,900
Oh my god, the spotty sense!

1136
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,240
The spotty sense dodge!

1137
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,860
Yeah, what happened on that screen?

1138
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:35,520
I don't know.

1139
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,200
There was 8 people there.

1140
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,700
Or you can tag in your assist to swap the leader and change the matchup on the fly.

1141
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,200
Ah, so it is like Marvel vs.

1142
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:43,900
Capcom.

1143
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:44,980
This game would be here, would come.

1144
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:50,360
This has just been an awesome journey and I'm excited that we get to be able to share it with all the fans out there.

1145
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:53,740
I'll tell you right now, a lot of fighting games, they never get to experience this level production.

1146
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:54,860
Marvel Battle Royale goes hard.

1147
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,180
You know how you can play that?

1148
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:56,900
Fortnite.

1149
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:00,600
That's just Fortnite, guys.

1150
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:13,080
And it's free, except when you buy the Marvel Skins.

1151
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,680
I think really, I gotta make something magical here.

1152
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:27,520
Yeah, just create a custom lobby and then be like, you can only play if you equip the Marvel Skins.

1153
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:31,460
And then create your own Marvel Battle Royale.

1154
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,300
I don't know about Star-Lord.

1155
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:37,000
I think the only skin I don't, the only skin I don't like is Star-Lord.

1156
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,700
He looks, I don't, I guess, I mean, Star-Lord is a dweeb in general.

1157
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:43,800
Like, in the end, he is a fucking dweeb.

1158
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,900
Um, but like, I don't know.

1159
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:49,180
I don't, I think Star-Lord is the one I'm iffy about.

1160
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,160
You're still with me?

1161
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:55,480
Oh?

1162
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:56,220
Is that it?

1163
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,820
Oh my god, it's already been an hour?

1164
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,280
Oh my, I did not feel like an hour.

1165
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:04,160
All these trailers passed by so fast.

1166
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,140
Wait, that was the, that was the ending.

1167
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,160
I mean, to be fair, that Marvel trailer was pretty fucking sick.

1168
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:12,140
But I wasn't expecting it.

1169
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:13,960
No Blood Point?

1170
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,600
Guys, we still have the Summer Game Fest.

1171
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,320
But I don't think we're gonna get Blood Point or Resident Evil.

1172
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:27,040
Yeah, I think the Marvel trailer was pretty fucking sick.

1173
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:28,460
I mean, there were a lot of cool games.

1174
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,800
I'm interested in the Pirate Game too.

1175
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:32,920
The Pirate Game seemed really fun.

1176
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:34,260
And the James Bond one.

1177
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:36,860
The James Bond one reminds me of an Indiana Jones.

1178
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:43,810
I mean, those are some good releases.

1179
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:44,810
Silent Hill...

1180
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:45,890
The James...

1181
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:51,970
I feel like the James Bond would be very similar to the Indiana Jones game as well.

1182
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:52,750
I feel like.

1183
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:54,410
It gave me the same vibe.

1184
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:55,110
PlayStation.

1185
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:55,930
PlayStation.

1186
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:57,710
That was good.

1187
00:54:58,050 --> 00:54:59,710
I feel like it was pretty good.

1188
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:02,690
Um, I mean, it's just from Sony.

1189
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:06,670
So, uh, I think that was a decent state of play.

1190
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:08,590
Um, state of play for me.

1191
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:10,510
There was a lot of games I'm actually looking forward to.

1192
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:12,370
So, uh, just for the PlayStation.

1193
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:13,030
Yeah.

1194
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:16,030
Um, um, not like a lot of...

1195
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:16,110
Yeah.

1196
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:17,370
Not a lot of heavy hitters.

1197
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:21,810
Uh, I mean, like, a lot of the games I was already looking forward to that have already been announced before.

1198
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:24,110
So, like, you know, Neo 3.

1199
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:26,070
Um, the Ghost of Yote.

1200
00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:30,490
Um, um, the games I...

1201
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:32,090
And then there's, like, you know, James Bond.

1202
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:32,470
James Bond.

1203
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:34,270
That seemed really interesting.

1204
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:36,190
James Bond one.

1205
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:38,230
And...

1206
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:39,070
The...

1207
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:39,730
The...

1208
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:40,790
The Tom...

1209
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:41,170
Sorry.

1210
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:41,890
Tom Bond.

1211
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:47,050
The Tom Bond game.

1212
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:49,090
And, uh...

1213
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:52,770
Um, that Marvel fighting game looks really fucking sick.

1214
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:54,670
But, like, obviously, as not...

1215
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:56,290
Like, I'm not the best at fighting games.

1216
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:57,070
So...

1217
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:01,730
The name's Tom...

1218
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:02,710
The name's Bond.

1219
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:03,950
Tom Bond.

1220
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:05,830
Um, the pirate...

1221
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:07,050
I think the pirate game looks fun.

1222
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:08,350
I like roguelikes in general.

1223
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:09,050
So...

1224
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:10,690
Um...

1225
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:11,410
Um...

1226
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:12,410
So, like...

1227
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:13,850
Uh...

1228
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:14,730
Like, the...

1229
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:16,930
The roguelike for that looks really good.

1230
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:18,050
Um...

1231
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:19,150
Silent Hill F.

1232
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:20,710
I'll play it with a million subscribers.

1233
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:22,410
But, like, other than that...

1234
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:25,250
That actually has a lot of my fucking fears.

1235
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:28,470
The moment I saw that girl that looks like the grudge girl, I was like, no.

1236
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:30,450
No.

1237
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:33,770
When I played the Silent Hill 2 remastered, I was...

1238
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:35,530
I could literally only play two hours...

1239
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:36,670
Two to three hours max.

1240
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:38,090
Three hours is pushing it.

1241
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:40,230
Like, two hours is, like, my comfortable zone.

1242
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,490
Before I go, like...

1243
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:42,390
I can't keep playing.

1244
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:42,830
Like...

1245
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:44,530
That was how fucking scared I am.

1246
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:44,930
I was like...

1247
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:46,150
I was literally getting goosebumps.

1248
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:47,230
And, like...

1249
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:47,550
Uh...

1250
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:48,570
My heart was beating.

1251
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:49,170
Like...

1252
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:50,610
Every time I have to play that game.

1253
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:51,750
So, I'm just like...

1254
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:52,190
Ah!

1255
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:54,350
And then...

1256
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:55,110
And then...

1257
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:55,970
But then, like...

1258
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:56,270
Oh...

1259
00:56:56,270 --> 00:56:58,310
Silent Hill F looks even more freaky.

1260
00:56:58,490 --> 00:56:59,570
Because, like...

1261
00:56:59,570 --> 00:56:59,910
There's, like...

1262
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:00,110
You know...

1263
00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:00,290
Like...

1264
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:02,570
Like...

1265
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:06,110
Old cities and stuff like that.

1266
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:07,970
And then it just reminds me of, like...

1267
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:08,750
Like...

1268
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:09,290
Ah...

1269
00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:10,310
I just...

1270
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:11,630
I just don't like that.

1271
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:12,750
And then the girl...

1272
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:13,530
The women...

1273
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:14,690
In the game...

1274
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:16,210
The monster looks like...

1275
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:17,170
Fucking grudge.

1276
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:18,010
I'm like...

1277
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,270
Oh...

1278
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:21,330
Oh...

1279
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:35,450
Oh...

1280
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:37,790
It will be echoing, unfortunately.

1281
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:38,630
Okay.

1282
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:40,450
Uh...

1283
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:41,730
Umm...

1284
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:42,770
So...

1285
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:45,790
I hope you guys can...

00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:48,190
We'll be okay...

1289
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:49,630
With this sound...

1290
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:55,510
Set up for the next couple of days, and then I'll be back on my old, old set up.

1291
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:01,690
But yes, thank you all for coming.

1292
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:03,850
I'll talk more about it later today.

1293
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:06,450
There is another... what is it?

1294
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:07,350
Is it Summer Game Fest?

1295
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:08,910
There is Summer Game Fest.

1296
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:15,590
So we have Summer Game Fest on Thursday, I believe, which will announce more and more games.

1297
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:18,630
And yeah, I'm looking forward to checking that out.

1298
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:25,930
But if you guys want to know more about, like, why I'm traveling and all that shit, I will be talking more about it later today in two hours.

1299
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:29,050
So yeah, for those who are new here, my name is Doki Bird.

1300
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:33,070
I usually stream on YouTube, and I'll be doing another stream on YouTube in two hours.

00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:38,190
So I'll be doing a chatting stream, just hanging out with everybody and talking with you guys, so you guys can check me out there.

1302
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:41,230
But it was great streaming again.

1303
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:44,010
I always want to stream, even when I'm, like, traveling.

1304
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:45,850
So yeah, thank you, everyone.

1305
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:48,330

00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:19,470
Thank you, thank you.

1322
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:21,910
What else did I want to say?

1323
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:25,830
If you want to support me via other means, I do have my Hyatt stuff that's still out.

Hey, I'll see you guys later, everyone.

1330
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:48,110
Uh, I'll figure out who to raid.

1331
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:49,450
Actually, I don't have an ending screen.

1332
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:49,750
Fuck.

1333
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:52,170
Uh, no raid.

1334
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:54,510
Because I forgot to set up an ending screen.

1335
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:57,330
So we just, we're just going to snap out of existence.

1336
00:59:57,770 --> 00:59:59,570
Uh, so thank you all for coming.

1337
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:03,330
As always, everybody, stay hydrated, pause your checkup, and move around to get that blood flow.

1338
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:06,530
And if you stay up for me, head to bed, because you deserve it.

1339
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:07,630
Uh, no raid, guys.

1340
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:09,410
We're just going to snap into the void.

1341
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:10,670
Bye-bye, everybody.

1342
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:11,630
Bye!
