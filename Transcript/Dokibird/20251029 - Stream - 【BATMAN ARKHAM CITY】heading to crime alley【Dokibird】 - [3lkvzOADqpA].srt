1
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,660
Hello, everybody.

2
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,320
Hello, hello.

3
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,920
We're back with more Batman.

4
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,320
Batman.

5
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:53,880
Do you guys know?

6
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,300
Fun fact.

7
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:00,340
You know, like, the old Batman show with Adam West.

8
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,800
Yeah, not the family guy, Adam West.

9
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,920
Like, the actual... I mean, he is the actor who was in Family Guy, who also played himself.

10
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:15,420
But before he was on Family Guy, He was also in Batman.

11
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,900
And back then, apparently, he would go to lots of orgies in his Batman costume.

12
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:41,720
And there's apparently in one of the orgies that Adam West went to in his Batman costume, him and the guy who played the Riddler, they both got kicked out of this orgie.

13
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,580
because they were two in character.

14
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:54,240
So the guy who's also playing the Riddler in that show, they both got kicked up because, you know, they were role-playing as the Riddler and the Batman.

15
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:00,300
So, is that such a fun fact?

16
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,820
I riddle me this, Batman.

17
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,340
They got kicked up because they were two.

18
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,180
They were two kicked.

19
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:42,860
And it's like, mmm, if you have to, if you want your release you gotta solve this riddle riddle me this based app now apparently adam west was a freaking freak like you yeah oh i mean like i i i mean like i guess because like hollywood but uh don't phrase it like this um took you less than five minutes into the stream thank you for the super chat osni thank you Thank you.

20
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,780
But wasn't it a fun fact, guys?

21
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,540
Lita, thank you for the Aka Supa.

22
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,340

Thank you.

24
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,920
Joki, take care of yourself.

25
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,820
You want to give me hope?

26
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,900
Help me through tough times.

27
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,980

28
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,720
We are real and we are here for you.

29
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,920
Thank you for the Aka Supa.

30
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:04,560
Aka, Aka.

31
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,140
Oh, my God.

32
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,140
DJ, thank you so much for the Aka, Aka Supa.

33
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,540
Really appreciate it, Lita.

34
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,380
Thank you always for all your support.

35
00:04:12,400 --> 00:05:11,160
for it man um but yeah no i thought apparently there's even more stories you know i did i didn't realize the character like i thought he was playing a character in um in family guy but that's actually him like because like back then when he was a lot younger during the batman days he was apparently a freaking freak so like he wasn't like the character of family gap was sort of based wild stories he used to do back in the Batman day like that's just how that's just how he was like that's it's just him like the fact that like he brought the costume with him during during the the fun sexy time this is wild in the back that like you know he took his orange cheese too I was like,

36
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:11,740
what?

37
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:19,260
Well, yeah, nobody messes with Adam West.

38
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,500
It wasn't Adam West as himself.

39
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,760
It was Adam West as Adam West.

40
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,600
But yeah, what a fun fact.

41
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:38,320
Also, I liked how I played Marvel Rivals at night and at DC in the, well, in the morning and technically in the evening.

42
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,260
But that's true unity.

43
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,600
Marvel Rivals at D-Gen Hours in DC in the evening.

44
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,220
Yeah, Adam Freaky West.

45
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,300
Also, another, an update.

46
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,300
There's a lot of updates.

47
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,740
There's a lot of hashtag ad updates and a lot of like regular updates.

48
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,540
But hashtag ad update.

49
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,380
We have a new voice pack up on the store right now.

50
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,540
I don't know if I, let me get the graphics real quick.

51
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,860
Let me save the graphics.

52
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,000
But yes, new Halloween voice packs are out, is out in the store.

53
00:06:10,380 --> 00:07:18,420
right now so uh we recently hired a new script writer to handle writing scripts and stuff for uh for me so um pretty exciting and also we have staff that's working on um the only issue with the issue of like voice packs and stuff is finding artists and contacting artists and everything and i don't have time for that so uh we recently delegated um uh like look locating and communicating with artists and stuff to a staff member and also we hired a script writer to also handle that as well so I don't have to worry about that anymore all I have to do is just record which is great like less work for me um so and with that we are also launching like additional merch along with the voice packs so the illustration um there's an option to also get um to also get like a button and also a snapshot as well with the of the illustration so obviously like you can just get the voice pack in the wallpaper or you can there's an option to just get the snapshot or even the snapshot and button so yeah let

54
00:07:18,420 --> 00:08:05,560
me post the dokey merch site right now um i did hear there was issues with the shipping prices um the staff is working on it at the moment i saw it in there are just like i said i don't handle majority i don't handle like the business side of the shop but i do have access to the group chat not group chat to the server of how the shop is being handled and everything so they are like um they are working on it i'm not sure exactly um how it's gonna go but i did see discussions about it um it's just because they don't have the items on hand at the moment um because it is pre-order for the snapshot and buttons so the snapshot buttons are pre-orders at the most so they don't have So they don't really know,

55
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,620
like, I guess they're just like, oh, since we don't have the items on hand is like what we believe the price should be.

56
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,760
But they are discussing about it because they're like, oh, yeah, it does seem a little bit more expensive than it should be.

57
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,520
But yeah, they're figuring it stuff out.

58
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,000
They're figuring it out right now.

59
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:32,360
I'm not sure exactly what is going on fully, but they are figuring it out just because I'm not in charge of the shop anymore.

60
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,480
There's a lot of numbers on there.

61
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,520
So, I have other stuff to deal with.

62
00:08:47,380 --> 00:09:02,440
Anyway, other than that, another update I'd like to give you guys is that I will be participating next week in the Street Fighter New Challengers Tournament.

63
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:31,800
team nephew so i was contacted by um capcon um because i know you guys were like i thought you won't do another like say jam slap this isn't say jam slam or like i thought you weren't going to do another tree fighter thing well um i said yes to this because i was contacted by um capcon um I was contacted by CapCon,

64
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,380
I think like a month ago, a month ago, a month or a month and a half ago.

65
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,620
I don't really remember whether or not I would like to participate in this.

66
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:57,400
And the thing is, they told me that it doesn't mean I would get picked because it is a drafting phase because people were like, oh, oh, wait, you didn't, you're not with like Brawl Pro because Brawl Pro is in this tournament as well.

67
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:26,940
and also in an hour my food's going to be here so we're going to eat while we're streaming too because I'm so fucking hungry anyway so they told me that it was a drafting phase so I don't even know how the drafting was done because it was done behind closed doors and they were just going to contact the people that got drafted in or got picked by by the captains which were the you know the FGC players.

68
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:35,780
So what I was told was that me signing up doesn't necessarily mean that I would get in.

69
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,040
So I was sort of surprised that I got in because I assumed they picked a lot.

70
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,140
They got a lot of content creators to fill out a form.

71
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,700
And then, you know, as the coaches decide who they want on their, like, you know, it's a draft phase.

72
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,280
So then they're like, look at the list of participants that want to be involved.

73
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,960
And then they just like, they like, oh, I'll pick this person.

74
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,620
I'll pick that through the draft phase.

75
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,240
So on the form, I didn't really sell myself on that form.

76
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:14,480
That's why I was like, because they're like, oh, you'll find out in like, I think like it was like, you'll find out like it was like last week, like on the 22nd.

77
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,120
They're like, oh, you'll find out on the 22nd if you get picked.

78
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:17,880
And I was like, all right, cool.

79
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:26,740
And then so on the form, they were like, what was what's your experience, you know, And I was like, I don't remember.

80
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,460
I was like, I was in stage, I'm slam, but not going to lie, I don't remember anything.

81
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,300
I don't remember how I don't remember anything.

82
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,540
And I don't know.

83
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,520
I, I legitimately forgot everything I learned.

84
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,120
Like I, I, I did not really sell myself.

85
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,820
I was like, I played Zangief on the farm.

86
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,000
And I was like, and then, and then, and then I remember writing.

87
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,780
I remember writing, I don't know how to block.

88
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:06,020
So, like, you know, that's why I was, like, very surprised because I, you know, I had to be transparent.

89
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,280
I wrote, I don't know how to block.

90
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,680
I don't do defense.

91
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,420
I only do attacks.

92
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:24,360
So, so, so, so that's why I was like, I was very surprised to get picked because I was, I felt like I wasn't really selling myself.

93
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,260
up as a very good player.

94
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,780
Yeah, I was like full aggression only.

95
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:39,140
so, you know, I, yeah, I got notified last week that, you know, I'll be in this tournament.

96
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,560
So this tournament starts next week.

97
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,980
I think it's like from the third to the seventh.

98
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,000
But yeah, it was a draft phase.

99
00:12:48,220 --> 00:13:06,400
So I assume like, you know, I assume it's a snake draft because that's usually what the draft phase is like where Each captain picks one from I assume I'm at the I'm at the lowest one like you know the beginner level so Which is understandable you're like but Doki you're you learned street fight.

100
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:13,860
No, I forgot I legitimately I don't remember anything I don't remember anything I've learned I don't remember any of the controls.

101
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:19,200
Yeah So so you don't understand I might as well be a beginning.

102
00:13:19,340 --> 00:14:18,580
I forgot everything I've ever learned so yeah like i did say in the past like oh most likely i might not do another tournament like this again because like it was very stressful and i do like um and you know i would rather do it in a new game versus uh going back to street fighter because i like experiencing new games and stuff and i'm also worried that they're i'm also like always worried they'll put me a tier above the beginner because they'll be like oh joki you played like you already did like a techin one and the street fighter one like um like oh we're gonna put you a tear up up beginning and i'm like don't do i'm always worried they'll do that to me um because i already forgot everything i already for uh forgot everything so that's also why i never really i didn't sign up again um and also because you know i wanted to give other people a chance to participate in these types of tournaments like you know the sage i'm sad i felt like you know i'd rather give a chance to be part of

103
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:48,000
stage i'm slammed like i can't be a beginner forever so and that's why i was always worried about like that you won't put me in the beginner slot um so i never signed up after the last stage i'm slammed but you know capcon contacted me and i was like oh it's something new it's something um it's something new it's something different um i still it's still street fighter but i felt like you know it's a new it's a new tournament and it's organized by Capcom.

104
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,980
And I felt like, you know, wow, Capcom directly reached out to me to sign up.

105
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,180
And it did say it doesn't necessarily mean I'd get picked.

106
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,460
And I, to be fair, I didn't sell myself on the forum too.

107
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,200
So I had, I was like, oh, maybe I won't get picked because I literally was said, like, I don't block.

108
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:11,640
Like, because I was going to be, I want to be transparent to like whoever drafted me and be like, if they expect me to block, that's on them.

109
00:15:11,900 --> 00:16:35,690
Like, I was so direct about what my skill sets were like if if they expected me to learn that's on them literally justin couldn't even teach me how to block you see so uh no i wanted because i don't you know like i can't disappoint them if i already tell them everything that was wrong with me like you know like they go in knowing what is wrong like so i can't disappoint them because they know they already know like um what's wrong like i'm not like i'm not like jump scaring them they're not blindsiding them with my weaknesses you know like i gotta set the expectations for them so um so yeah i like i have no idea if i was last picked i mean i can't be last picked because i was picked in the end because they did say um they did say like it me signing up for it doesn't mean i'd get picked because they apparently had like a list of participants like list of content creators and stuff and then like the captains themselves were like picking from that list um and you know like the the the

110
00:16:35,690 --> 00:17:31,490
upside of everything is that i'm not participating in the new stage i'm slam for the 2x ko tournament um which is also happening at the same time so like you know half i think like half the people in this capcom one is also participating in the 2x ko tournament so i would assumed they would have they you know they have to split practices and stuff between the two you know between like street fighter and 2x ko because like you know even though it is a fighting game um even though it is a fighting game there's like you know it still plays differently compared like between the two so it's like you know for me the upside of picking me is that i don't have to practice for the other game I don't have to,

111
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:36,250
I don't have to, like, you know, remember how to play two different games.

112
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,730
I just have to remember how to play one game.

113
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:46,250
Yeah, so I assume, like, yeah, like, you know, like learning the other game will bleed into Street Fighter as well.

114
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,210
So, you know, conflicting buttons and everything.

115
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,390
And also you guys split the time, too.

116
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:54,130
So I won't have, like, conflicting stuff to remember.

117
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,750
So, like, I just have to learn one character.

118
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,210
Well, technically relearn a character.

119
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,450
I don't know if I'm going to play Zangief.

120
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:04,270
I feel like it was very iconic for me to play Zangief.

121
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,090
And then I was talking to Justin.

122
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,030
I messaged Justin.

123
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,650
I mean, like, you want to coach me again?

124
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,550
Sadly, Justin, yeah, we're in first name bases, bro.

125
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,770
That's how tight we are.

126
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,310
I don't know.

127
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,550
It feels weird calling him Mr. Wang.

128
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:25,370
But sadly, Justin will be traveling next week.

129
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,770
So he won't be available for like another coaching session.

130
00:18:29,830 --> 00:19:02,370
um but he said he would like drop by and like you know yeah that wasler um he would drop by and like see like whenever he is free to like give me like text help but not like actually like help me in game because he will be uh he'll be on a vacation for next week uh but yeah he was telling me that like oh yeah zan geef got nerfed hard so like he he sort of uh he's sort of pretty mid and i was I was like,

131
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,730
no, don't say it like that.

132
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,310
Like, he's like low tier.

133
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:09,590
He told me he's like, he's pretty low tier in meta right now.

134
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:12,690
And I'm like, oh, oh, no.

135
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,490
Oh, no, no, no.

136
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:19,270
Like, nothing can truly nerf the grappler.

137
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:23,230
I don't, I don't know how he is like low tier.

138
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,990
I don't know how he'd be low tier.

139
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,810
Because I'm like, how the fuck do you?

140
00:19:29,830 --> 00:20:05,580
nerf a grappler and like that's all he has so he just he just has to grab i i don't understand like i i it's crazy i played him and then he gets nerfed um yeah so so i don't know if i will be playing zengi for um for this tournament we'll see how it goes like the coaching stuff starts next week anyway so i do have a lot of time to think about it but i have contacted an additional coach to help me out,

141
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:09,320
but I'll keep it a surprise until next week's schedule.

142
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:16,180
I won't reveal who it is until next week's schedule.

143
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,020
But it's going to be, it's going to be pretty fun.

144
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,320
I am very nervous.

145
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:29,040
Like I said, it has been a while since I've played a fighting game.

146
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:38,020
my Zangief clips, my Zangief clips, um, because I was like, what the fuck did I do?

147
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,940
And I was rewatching, like, how the fuck did I do that?

148
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:54,180
I was like, oh my god, this dokey was a different dokey back then, because I was rewatching it, I was like, how the fuck did I, oh my god, how did I have, like, the brain power to do all of this?

149
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:59,560
I was like, oh my, I was too bad, right now, I'd just be, like button mashing everything.

150
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,080
I was, yeah, I was in the grapple zone.

151
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:13,060
Yeah, my, yeah, that was a different dokey at that day.

152
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,780
Like, I was re-watching those clips.

153
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,520
I was like, Jesus Christ, I did that.

154
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,160
Oh my God, I was built different.

155
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,120
I really was.

156
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:54,940
Like, I don't even recognize that dokey when I was watching those clips so I was very very surprised um but yeah I legitimately don't know um how I'm gonna do uh next week uh yeah I'm cooked I maybe I'll surprise everyone who knows Jim thank you with super chat thank you thank you the thing is um I don't know what I'm doing I'm pretty sure last year's Jokey did not know what she was doing either.

157
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,860
But like, thing is, I don't know what I'm doing.

158
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:03,260
And if I don't know what I'm doing, they don't know what I'm doing.

159
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,120
And I remember that was my strat.

160
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:11,320
As long as my head is head empty, they can't predict anything.

161
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,940
And that has worked out for me throughout all these tournaments.

162
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,720
It has always worked out for me.

163
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:54,120
standard dokey technique um yeah to confuse the enemy i have to confuse myself first uh swordsman thank you for the super chat thank you thank you blackfire thank you for the five gifted ships thank you thank you exactly how do you download that witch has no thoughts exactly how can you coach someone against me when everything i do is so unpredictable and doesn't make sense It's like,

164
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:58,320
you know, they're going to, like, they're supposed to do this move, but I don't know that.

165
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,460
What do you mean I'm supposed to do this move?

166
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,680
I just do whatever feels right.

167
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,080
I'm just reacting.

168
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,420
Like, logically, they're supposed to do this input.

169
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,880
I don't know that.

170
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,580
How am I supposed to know what's logical?

171
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,300
I just do what feels fucking right.

172
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,540
What, what I want to do.

173
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,660
I'm just vibing.

174
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,220
That's my go.

175
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:24,560
Yeah.

176
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,600
So, yeah, I'm looking forward to...

177
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,700
I've never talked to any of these people before.

178
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,540
That's what I'm also most nervous about.

179
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:40,100
I've never interacted with any of these people before.

180
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,080
I mean, I've heard of Emily.

181
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,320
Emily Wang.

182
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:49,260
But other than that, I don't know, Nephew was in a couple of Sage M slams.

183
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,820
So it'll be pretty interesting.

184
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,860
as I've never interacted with these people before.

185
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:02,340
And I'm also very nervous just because, like, I've never interacted with any other people in this group before.

186
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,900
So, you know how I'm always, like, super nervous with new people.

187
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,260
So I hope it'll be fun.

188
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,560
I hope it'll be really fun.

189
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,500
I hope we'll have a good time bonding with this team.

190
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,280
And, you know, I hope we do okay.

191
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,720
My hope is that we are not last.

192
00:24:22,880 --> 00:25:18,600
that's my goal not last and if anything i hope i win at least one game because i don't know how hard these people are gonna try you know because i remember the last day jam slam um people were like fucking what was that word called they were like analyzing me hard because i for one day i like won all my matches and then they all like hard analyzed my gameplay and shit well i took a one day break and it fucked me over yeah they were laughing against me they would they were like laughing against like my playstyle and stuff and i took a one day break because i was so tired i was so fucking tired oh my food's here yay give me a sec

193
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:57,760
i have to make sure i don't talk because then they'll be like what the fuck am i talking to um but yeah so so i won't take a one day break again because who would have thought that one day i didn't play didn't practice street fighter everyone like leveled up 20 levels um so i would so i learned from that like i gotta keep grinding there's no apparently there's no breaks in street fighter um but yeah i my goal for this tournament i feel like not last might be too high of an expectation.

194
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,580
I would say I hope I win one game.

195
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,680
That's my goal.

196
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,680
The moment I win one game, I'm happy.

197
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,060
It was stuck for the guy that lost to me.

198
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:13,680
But like, I'd be happy with just one win through all my matches.

199
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,940
Just because I legitimately forgot everything.

200
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,520
I don't even know what any of the buttons do anymore.

201
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,400
Like I just know if you walk backwards, it blocks.

202
00:26:25,540 --> 00:27:02,980
and that I cannot play on the right oh yeah and then me admitting to everybody that I can't play on the right hand side sort of fucked me over because like I never learned because I never learned how to use how to fight on the right hand side because it's a different because you have to reverse your inputs and I'm like you gotta reverse your inputs and I was like that's weird that's that's like weird oh my god did this person fuck up the the elevator give me a sec guys i gotta mute myself they called me again but on their personal phone

203
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:26,600
sorry i'm just like i'm checking the messages to see like what they if they said anything oh my god they're trying to do like a voicemail or some shit like excuse me

204
00:27:33,580 --> 00:28:19,000
Oh my god I'm trying to like I mean It's so annoying Because I have the full instructions Because it's very complicated Because you have to use the intercom To access my elevator And it's like you have to use A specific side of the elevator To No it's not say jam slam Apparently it's like similar to say jam slam But this one is fully run by Capcom versus say jam and like you know um i wanted to give this is why i didn't do say i didn't do say jam slam after last time because i want to give people like new players new content creators a chance to participate um wait

205
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:53,860
what the fuck i called and would have made waited more but there is no parking so i have to please collect i'm collect from the lobby i tried buzzing in when i entered the lift it didn't let me go oh my god you're so i'm giving him a bad review they dropped it at the lobby they just put it in the oh my god rate my order i have to pick you up at the lobby guys I'm actually pretty pissed.

206
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,940
I'm pretty pissed at that.

207
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,040
Tip the courier?

208
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:01,940
No.

209
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,580
I give him $0.

210
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:06,820
Yeah, no.

211
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,180
That's just...

212
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,360
That actually makes me mad at the...

213
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,040
Because it's like...

214
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,840
Yeah, they just left my food on the table at the lobby.

215
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,680
Yeah, I have to go downstairs to pick it up.

216
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:30,940
Because like, the thing is, I had very clear instructions on how to, uh, because like the thing is, all you have to do is just call the intercom.

217
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:31,960
I let you in.

218
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,820
And then you go on, there's like left or right.

219
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,260
And then I specify which elevator you have to go to.

220
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:45,200
And then, so like, I think he went on the wrong elevator because there's like left or right.

221
00:29:45,240 --> 00:30:32,160
And I think he went on the other side on the one that he shouldn't have gone to because you have to because then it would like take you to yeah it had like very clear step-by-step instructions because of how complicated it is and um um um and so like but like i rarely have any issues with that like i think like i never had a person i had one time someone leave in the lobby um but just because i didn't put instructions in um and that like this is the first time i had some guy that just left it in the lobby yeah he didn't read um only i'm allowed to not read only um only i'm allowed to not be able to read so i mean

222
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:43,420
how do i rate the guy i want to rate the person okay there you go

223
00:30:46,620 --> 00:31:14,960
all right i'll go pick up my food i guess i'll be right back guys i'll be right back everybody let's see brb picking up my food i ordered uh i ordered fried rice brb picking up my food with fagra i know i know i i fagra is just so good guys what i i'm sorry i i know the implications I know what I am.

224
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:15,680
I'm sorry.

225
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,040
I'll be right back.

226
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:01,840
Holy shit.

227
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,280
There were so many people in the elevator.

228
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,360
I had to wait so long.

229
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,040
It's crazy.

230
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:09,140
Oh, I think, like, I think it's because everyone's coming home to, like, at this time.

231
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:16,200
I literally, there was, like, we have, like, a lot of elevators, and even then I had to wait so long to even go downstairs and go up.

232
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:24,540
Like, even when I was going up, there was, like, there was, like, six people in my elevator obviously.

233
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,280
Gotta go home.

234
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,380
Get home.

235
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Yeah.

236
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,840
Got my friend.

237
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:30,060
Right.

238
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,420
You have people who camp to leave.

239
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,360
People with their nine to five.

240
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:35,540
Coming home.

241
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,420
They're using my elevator.

242
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,760
All right.

243
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,700
Did he forgot?

244
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,040
No!

245
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,000
They didn't give me a fork.

246
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,900
I hate it.

247
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,560
You know, grinds my gears when don't get a fork.

248
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,860
I just want utensils.

249
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,020
Hey, when I don't get my...

250
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,580
They get like...

251
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,780
Hey, when like they don't give me utensils and stuff, I have to...

252
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,960
It's like, yeah, forks at home, you guys.

253
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,360
Real metal forks, not just plastic forks.

254
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,220
Real metal forks.

255
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,480
And also, I bought mango juice, too.

256
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:18,680
Let me take a couple of bites of my food, and then we'll start Batman.

257
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,980
But yeah, I am looking forward to this tournament.

258
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,440
I haven't done a tournament thing in a while.

259
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,500
I'm very nervous.

260
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,400
Like I said, I'm very nervous because I forgot how to play.

261
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,800
I forgot how to play the game.

262
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,640
At least I hope I'm fighting other beginners.

263
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,960
That's all I hope for.

264
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,760
I hope I'm fighting all of the other beginners.

265
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,600
And I hope I don't get absolutely demolished.

266
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,020
Adatra, thank you for the super chat.

267
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:52,840

So I have to boot it up.

271
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,880
Windowed first before I do it full screen.

328
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:57,600
The most important control in this game.

329
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,060
Do you know you have to play Mama Rise roughly 11% of the time?

330
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,740
The game has been released!

331
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:03,800

337
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,820
Where did it come from?

338
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:24,020
Who keeps throwing these batterans at this direction?

339
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:27,460

You sure he came from where?

349
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,520
What happened?

350
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,980

00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,680

Oh shit.

353
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,480
The double nukes.

354
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,560
Yeah, the tactics go to assist.

355
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,540
This is where the tax tucks go to.

356
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:47,400
Alright.

357
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,060
Okay, he's...

358
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:53,020
One of them's dead.

359
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,040
Oh, that guy's dead.

360
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:55,040
Okay, last guy.

361
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:56,920
Come on.

362
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,080
You're the last one.

363
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:02,420
Come on.

364
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:03,300
You know what?

365
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,180
Fuck it.

366
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:04,800
Ooh.

367
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,400
How do I...

368
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,800
I'm sure it came from over there.

369
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:07,980
Ooh.

370
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:11,180
There we go.

371
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,000
We did it.

372
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,400
It was just that easy.

373
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:24,630
Oh wait, it's not even...

374
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:26,810
Oh my god.

375
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:28,130
I had to go there.

376
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:30,150
Oh my god, I thought this was the place.

377
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:33,890
I didn't realize it took me like so far away.

378
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:35,830
Was this not the place?

379
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:36,830
No, it is, right?

380
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:39,950
This is where Mr. Freeze lives, right?

381
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:41,470
This has to be where he lives.

382
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:43,090
Alright, there you go.

383
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:47,540
Okay, it is.

384
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:48,320
Okay, thank God.

385
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,000
I was gonna be like, there's no way.

386
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,280
1R.A.

387
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,280
1RT.

388
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:53,800
1.

389
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:54,540
What is that?

390
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,140
Oh, here.

391
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:57,840
Oh, it is the police station.

392
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,060
Okay, I was got a little worried.

393
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:01,260
I was like, wait, am I not supposed to be here?

394
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,520
I guess it's under, right?

395
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,920
There's like a garage door.

396
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,580
Where would the garage be?

397
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,960
I guess here, right?

398
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:14,880
Oh, yeah, it is.

399
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:15,920
Uh...

400
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,030
It was this, but how do I use it?

401
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:23,840
There you go.

402
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:27,880
Not enough?

403
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,180
What the fuck?

404
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,060
It's not enough.

405
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:37,340
Is there something else I'm missing?

406
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,120
Why is it not powering up?

407
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,420
Oh my god, a stupid payphone.

408
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,200
Alright, hello.

409
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:48,500

413
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:35,560
this is a robin job not a Batman job I should be outsourcing to my children because all I'm gonna say I'm gonna say like what's the point of having of adopting all these orphans if I can't use them how can I exploit these children.

414
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:38,880
Like...

415
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:39,540

Do I actually have to do it?

420
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:57,540
Jesus Christ.

421
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,560

00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,760
Guys, I don't know where he is, guys.

455
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,320
It's so unfortunate.

456
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,260
Really?

457
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:29,880
Where?

458
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,000
Oh, there you go.

459
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:32,920
I'm at the police station now.

460
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,060
Alright.

461
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,740
See if I can remember how to do this again.

462
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:40,140
Alright.

463
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:41,640
Oh, yeah, I have to run and...

464
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,160
Was it run and slide?

465
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:45,580
There you go.

466
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:52,320
If I hack this radio, I'll be able to listen into all of Penguin's communication.

467
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,760
Alright, I'm gonna hack it in.

468
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:55,280
I'm in.

469
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,460
The backslide.

470
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:13,650
Are there any radio stations?

471
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:15,010
Is there any music stations here?

472
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:17,550
Unlucky.

473
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:19,510

00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:25,150

478
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:56,170
Yeah, what about Batman?

479
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:57,610

483
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:05,030
Trying to chill.

484
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:06,170
What does it look like?

485
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:07,570
How do I know?

486
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:09,350
So how will we know when we find him?

487
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:13,850

489
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:18,850
There's nothing here.

490
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:20,390

00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:31,100
That's right.

500
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,700
Are you, though?

501
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:34,920
Are you sure of it?

502
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,560
I'm sure it came from over there.

503
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:40,160
How sure are you?

504
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,000

This way!

507
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:48,140
He went this way!

508
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:50,100
There's no way it can...

509
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,560
Keep working.

510
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,240
Yeah, it does.

511
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:55,540
Oh, shit.

512
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:57,300
Okay, it's not working anymore.

513
00:55:59,040 --> 00:55:59,560
Wee!

514
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,240
Oh, my God.

515
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:01,700
Oh, my God.

516
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:02,280
It's not working.

517
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:03,400
It's actually not working.

518
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:06,280
Look at it.

519
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:06,680
It's okay.

520
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:07,980
They don't know.

521
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:09,660
They're so confused.

522
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,360
Watch this.

523
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:16,280
Wait.

524
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,100
Come on.

525
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,200
Oh, no, he's not close enough.

526
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,740
I'm just gonna...

527
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:29,060
Wee!

528
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:29,380
Ha!

529
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:35,160
Penguins keep in track of his head.

530
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:38,920
He'll know each time I take someone out, I need to move quickly.

531
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:39,740
Oh, God.

532
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,000
Everyone, get your answers over it!

533
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,680
You're not getting past me again!

534
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:44,080
Ha!

535
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:46,340
He's dead.

536
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:47,660
That's right.

537
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:48,760
Oh, I'm dead!

538
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:50,560
Ha!

539
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,280
Someone cut the mask off his face.

540
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:57,640
I thought he's talking about the guy I killed.

541
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,960
I was like, oh, no, it was me.

542
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,660
Oh, he's talking about me.

543
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:03,900
I'm dead.

544
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:05,480
Who would have thought?

545
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:07,860
Joker's crew are still outside.

546
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,660
I thought he's talking about the guy killed.

547
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:12,700
No problem.

548
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:16,000
Yep, I'm dead.

549
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:16,460
Listen up.

550
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:18,520
Boss wants this place held tight.

551
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,000
No one in or out.

552
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:22,420
You see why Joker's crew waste them.

553
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:39,640
he's dead it's me just like that all right let's just go this way i feel like the random bullshit did more work did more work than me actually playing the game

555
00:57:58,460 --> 00:57:58,680
Yoink!

556
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,300
Gotcha now!

557
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:04,840
Penguins keeping track of his crew using heartbeat markers.

558
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:06,920
He'll know each time I take someone out.

559
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,820
I need to move quickly.

560
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:13,400
I'll never know I'm here.

561
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:18,380
And then...

562
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:18,920
Where are you?

563
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:19,280
Bop!

564
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:23,020
See?

565
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:24,600
It was so quick, guys.

566
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,580
Don't never expect this.

567
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:29,680
That's right.

568
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,240
And another one.

569
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,040
Oh, shit.

570
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:34,440
Oh, fuck.

571
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,200
How did they know?

572
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,860
How did they find out?

573
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:41,640
Over here.

574
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:42,780
Oh, my God.

575
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:43,880
They keep looking up.

576
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,100
How do they know how to look up?

577
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,080
That's illegal.

578
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,580
Oh, my God.

579
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:51,240
That's illegal.

580
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:52,380
That actually is.

581
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:55,740
They're not supposed to know if I keep going back and forth.

582
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:59,260
I know what you're doing, and it ain't gonna work.

583
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,020
Oh, yeah, you can't catch me.

584
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:02,280
I'm so fucking fast.

585
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:05,380
Whoooooo!

586
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:07,480
Baa!

587
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,080
There's no way he lives from that.

588
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,960
I literally, like, slam-dunked him with my entire body.

589
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:14,840
This ain't happening.

590
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,160
I've got another man down over here.

591
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:18,500
Yeah?

592
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:20,500
Get out of here.

593
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,100
That's right.

594
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,940
You ain't shotgunning shit!

595
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:26,960
Please, I get out of here.

596
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,340
Oh, interrogate?

597
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:31,840
All right, tell me everything you know.

598
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:32,960
He's in the museum.

599
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:34,200
Penguin's got him.

600
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,900
No, I'm sorry, Mr. Cobblepot.

601
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:43,300
He made me tell him.

602
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:46,600
That's right.

603
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:49,140
That's right.

604
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,480
Snitches get stitches.

605
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,180
I'm here to teach you that.

606
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,380
I'm like, I won't do anything.

607
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:57,940
You tell me everything, except I'll give you a concussion.

608
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,240
All right, rescue him.

609
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:02,060
Okay, rescue Mr. Freeze from...

610
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:04,640
Wait, Penguin has Mr. Freeze?

611
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:08,060
Why won't he just freeze him?

612
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:08,900
Is he stupid?

613
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:11,180
That doesn't sound good.

614
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:13,580
Yeah, that's right.

615
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:16,020
I gotta teach him that Snitches get stitches.

616
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:19,940
He thinks he's playing Spider-Man.

617
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:23,200
It's like I'm Mad Bat.

618
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:25,920
Anything cool here?

619
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,220
Anything neat?

620
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,200
Why is there like...

621
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,440
Oh, is this like the autopsy area in the police station?

622
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:38,560
What kind of fucking police station is this?

623
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:43,110
Holy shit.

624
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:50,630
I guess I gotta leave.

625
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:51,930
The Gotham.

626
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:52,770
Yeah, I'm like wondering.

627
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:53,310
Oh my god.

628
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:54,950
Wait, the vents.

629
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:56,670
The vents won't let me through.

630
01:00:57,590 --> 01:00:58,870
Yeah, Mr. Freeze stupid.

631
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:00,450
Why don't you just freeze him?

632
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:02,550
God, stupid riddle me this.

633
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:04,430
I'm gonna riddle me this fast.

634
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:04,990
Man.

635
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:08,590
Is there anything interesting here?

636
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:10,610
Guys, am I missing anything here?

637
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:14,210
Like, it's a police station.

638
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:15,970
Like, why does the Gothen...

639
01:01:15,970 --> 01:01:21,110
Why... How does the Gothen police have this much budget for anything with the stuff they do?

640
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:24,390
Like, with the stuff they... Sorry, let me rephrase that.

641
01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:27,010
With the stuff they don't do.

642
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:34,430
I feel like... I feel like I should cut the police.

643
01:01:34,450 --> 01:02:04,100
budget Alfred hello sir there were complications penguin has got his hands on freeze and trapped me in the GCPD building oh yeah forgot Joker gave me super aids reminding me Alfred I'm in a police building cobblepots obviously bribed some official into giving him the lock codes for the municipal structures I'm downloading the unlock codes right now

644
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:15,150
I assume that's the other side.

645
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:18,490
When I was, like, in this area, I was like, what the fuck is the point of being here?

646
01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:20,010
Yeah, I knew it.

647
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:21,210
Makes sense.

648
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:25,910
Okay.

649
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:26,430
Oops.

650
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:32,360
Am I not doing it?

651
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,600
Oh, I have to press R2.

652
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:38,100
What the fuck?

653
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:46,020
How the...

654
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:47,120
Um, excuse me.

655
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:47,580
Yeah.

656
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:52,000
Am I not doing it correctly?

657
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:59,060
Rotate so you find the point at which the letters stop.

658
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:00,280
Yeah, I'm rotating.

659
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:05,420
The other one, the other side isn't doing anything.

660
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:10,100
Oh!

661
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:13,240
Sorry, the right agnologue stick.

662
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:14,920
There we go.

663
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:16,840
I forgot about the right side.

664
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:21,560
I only read 50%.

665
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:25,060
Thank you, the magenta soup, but thank you, thank you.

666
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:28,460
Riddle me this, riddle me that was red and black and smack.

667
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:29,100
Why?

668
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:32,100
Alright.

669
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:33,420
That's easy.

670
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:37,900
After I figure out how to read the last 50% of that instruction.

671
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,620
Sorry, my right side of the brain doesn't work as well as my left.

672
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:48,520
Whoa, shit.

673
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:51,840
That sounds very bad.

674
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:00,490
Alright.

675
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:04,870
Yeah, but we don't care about that.

676
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:05,950
You're just goons.

677
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:07,430
You're replaceable.

678
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:11,710
And your point is, well, it's just you live

679
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:16,680
where you die, son.

680
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:19,700
And then you super chat think you think, yeah, I played Arkham Asylum.

681
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:24,540
That's right.

682
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:26,600
And now I leave.

683
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,900
Fuck that guy in particular.

684
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:31,040
Oh, no.

685
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:33,100
Am I dead?

686
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:34,240
Oh, I'm okay.

687
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:36,420
Bubblepot has made his move.

688
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:37,700
Leave them to it.

689
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:45,060
It will be interesting to witness how things progress as we approach Protocol 10.

690
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:46,080
Affirmative.

691
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:47,940
83, continue your patrol.

692
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:48,600
Out.

693
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,120
That's right.

694
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,940
Not a good day for that one guy.

695
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:59,140
Sucker Punch Simpson leaves.

696
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,120
That's right, I'm Batman.

697
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:03,380

We relived trauma.

708
01:07:51,770 --> 01:07:52,430
Mission accomplished.

712
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:08,710

714
01:08:16,770 --> 01:08:17,750

01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:17,890
Where is it?

716
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:18,830
Okay, it's so far.

717
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:19,850
I'll join Penguin.

718
01:08:20,610 --> 01:08:24,610
Look, maybe he shouldn't have fucking visited crime alley.

719
01:08:27,890 --> 01:08:29,450
That's his own fault.

720

Okay, that was crazy.

725
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,600
That was a crazy-ass move.

726
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:27,600
Like, I- Bro, if my fucking fist does nuclear bomb shit, make nuclear bomb sound effects, I feel like...

727
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:31,120

728
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:34,380

01:10:13,090 --> 01:10:15,650
His fucking fist literally just broke the sound barrier.

731
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:21,620
I opened this door with decryptor.

732
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:34,020
I'm in.

733
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,200
Just use the door.

734
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:47,160
This is Penguin's turf, you freak.

735
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:49,860
I'm gonna cut you up in the tiny piece.

736
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:50,380
Oh yeah?

737
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:53,300
Watch this.

738
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:54,480
Wait what?

739
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:57,180
Hold...

740
01:10:57,180 --> 01:10:57,540
Oh.

741
01:10:58,140 --> 01:10:59,640
Oh shit, sorry, I'm trying.

742
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:01,720

743
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:02,580
What?

744
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:03,780
Am I not...

745
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:05,120
Fuck this.

746
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:07,480
Fuck this.

747
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:13,980
I've had enough.

748
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:15,900
I don't need a dodge.

749
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:24,420
I try... I try to follow the rules.

750
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,880
But I realized...

751
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:31,280
Following the rules is for pussies.

752
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:34,180
The old reliable.

Danger for the deep.

757
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:49,760
In the aquatic observations...

758
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:50,860
Huh?

759
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:54,020
What the fuck do I do?

760
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:58,220
Oh, all right.

761
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:01,160
I see.

762
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,620
One-way glass.

763
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,060
What the fuck?

764
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,740
Oh my god, it's like his calling card.

765
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:09,840
He has a penguin.

766
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:14,440
Okay.

767
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:17,480
Guess I have to start hacking.

768
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:40,340
I don't think I want you breaking into my little old Batman Something's blocking communication back to the bad cave Penguin must be using military grade communication disruptors The only way to crack this security is to destroy them Oh okay Where's the jammer

769
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:49,700
Disable penguins destroy okay I gotta find Three hostile, three unarmed.

770
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:51,740
Okay, how do I...

771
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:53,340
Why can't I just break this?

772
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,060
I'll never get past the security.

773
01:12:57,980 --> 01:12:58,900
I should head back outside.

774
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,220
Oh, it's outside.

775
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:01,140
Okay.

776
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,320
It's outside.

777
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:05,720
Alright, that's good to know.

778
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,100
I was gonna beat the shit out of that computer.

779
01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:14,370
42.

780
01:13:15,010 --> 01:13:15,810
It's this way.

781
01:13:18,650 --> 01:13:24,030
All you need to know Where the fuck is the jam, man?

782
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:26,630
Hey, are you a bad person?

783
01:13:28,010 --> 01:13:29,630
He's unarmed, so I couldn't tell.

784
01:13:30,330 --> 01:13:31,050
Give me a sec.

785
01:13:32,310 --> 01:13:33,710
I just walked up like, hey, buddy.

786
01:13:37,490 --> 01:13:38,330
There you go.

787
01:13:38,570 --> 01:13:39,110
You know what?

788
01:13:39,470 --> 01:13:40,450
Wait, this is just easier.

789
01:13:41,970 --> 01:13:42,950
Get out of here.

790
01:13:43,930 --> 01:13:44,770
That's right.

791
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:46,290
I don't care if you're unarmed.

792
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:52,500
Why are you...

793
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:54,360
Is that the Jammer over there?

794
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:56,900
What is that?

795
01:13:57,700 --> 01:13:59,240
Oh, that's a security camera.

796
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:00,540
Whoops.

797
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:07,040
How the fuck is it?

798
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:09,700
Down here?

799
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,660
Where the fuck is this stupid-ass Jammer?

800
01:14:22,390 --> 01:14:26,310
Where are my- what are my, like, 20 robins doing anyway?

801
01:14:26,690 --> 01:14:27,970
You don't need to get it.

802
01:14:28,170 --> 01:14:29,770
Oh my god, it was up here this entire time.

803
01:14:29,790 --> 01:14:30,210
time.

804
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:33,810
Now that I think about it, what the fuck are they doing?

805
01:14:38,150 --> 01:14:39,970
Oh my god, really need this.

806
01:14:42,930 --> 01:14:43,790
Oh, it's right here.

807
01:14:44,170 --> 01:14:45,550
Guarded by 20 security guards.

808
01:14:45,930 --> 01:14:47,610
I wonder why I never noticed that.

809
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:50,810
Taking care of Gotham.

810
01:14:51,090 --> 01:14:51,510
Where?

811
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:54,330
I'm literally here in Gotham City.

812
01:14:54,450 --> 01:14:55,670
I do not see it.

813
01:14:56,210 --> 01:14:58,630
I do not hear anything about them.

814
01:15:00,870 --> 01:15:01,650
Okay.

815
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:04,110
Oh, that's not good.

816
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:09,280
Alright.

817
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:12,260
That's fucking right.

818
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:13,160
Get out of here.

819
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:14,880
Boom!

820
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:18,860
That's right.

821
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:21,580
You know what?

822
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:22,780
Yeah.

823
01:15:26,970 --> 01:15:28,370
Get this out.

824
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:32,020
The best way to...

825
01:15:32,750 --> 01:16:02,210
The best way to destroy a jammer three to shut it down has three terminals wait that's terminal one oh they're all here that's cool I was gonna say three terminals terminals where could it be time to fist the machine jammer down I should look for more all right next one is this way one of the jammer signals disappeared sorry mr.

826
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:13,320
Okay, now that I know that the jammers are guarded by 20 security guards, it's a lot easier.

827
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:20,420
Okay, I was like, I thought it'd be like, you know, more hidden, but now that I know, it's really 20 people.

828
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:25,880
There you go, I see them.

829
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,300
He's a collector.

830
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:31,400
He's got things you've never heard of.

831
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:32,400
And that's the fact.

832
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:33,600
Oh, shit!

833
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:36,200
It's fine.

834
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:37,640
On you.

835
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:39,400
Whoops.

836
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,240
Yes, it wasn't on you.

837
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:47,520
Smoke bomb!

838
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:49,880
Where are you?

839
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:51,340
There you are.

840
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:53,800
That's fucking right.

841
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:54,640
Wait, where's he?

842
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:55,640
Oh, shit, wait.

843
01:16:58,920 --> 01:16:59,740
Wait, what?

844
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:02,600
Let me fist this real quick.

845
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:03,580
Then I give me a sec.

846
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:04,620
Just let me...

847
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:04,840
No!

848
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:05,700
No, no, no, no!

849
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:06,020
No!

850
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:08,560
Get out of here!

851
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:11,360
Alright.

852
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:14,580
Interrupting a good fisting.

853
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:18,060
Alright, nice.

854
01:17:22,830 --> 01:17:24,150
Gotta let me finish, bro.

855
01:17:24,830 --> 01:17:25,550
I didn't claw.

856
01:17:26,110 --> 01:17:27,310
That's not bro behavior.

857
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:30,390
We've only just managed to get below ground.

858
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:31,230
Just set

859
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:38,520
it.

860
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:40,560
It's downstairs, okay.

861
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:44,940
Sounds like Penguin's final jammer was activated somewhere underneath Arkham City.

862
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:46,880
Okay, it's in the sewers.

863
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:50,140
Jesus, pressure's so far.

864
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:53,480
What's this?

865
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:55,160
Oh, yeah, we don't need a dive bomb.

866
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:58,280
Oh, I have to level it up.

867
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:00,100
Do we want...

868
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:02,260
Do we want special combo boost, right?

869
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:05,760
All special combo moves will be available after...

870
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:06,560
Yeah, we should get that.

871
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:09,260
I'm just here to beat up people.

872
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:17,080
Why doesn't he just make, like, non-lethal gun?

873
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:19,700
I ain't got a ping-pong gun.

874
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:23,600
I feel that.

875
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:24,560
I just need a batter-ons.

876
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:27,140
No, batter-ons are more lethal than a gun.

877
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:28,320
That's sharp as fuck.

878
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:30,300
Do you think about it?

879
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:34,500
Like this way.

880
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:38,460
I didn't think about it.

881
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:40,600
The clue was in the name.

882
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:42,080
Oh, shit!

883
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:43,360
What the fuck?

884
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,440
Where did it come from?

885
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:54,100
All right, I'm leaving.

886
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:55,920
Smoke bomb!

887
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,800
Yeah, figure out where the fuck this...

888
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,880
Where is the last...

889
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:03,920
Okay, it's down here.

890
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:05,700
Oh my gosh, I have to be up here.

891
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:06,900
That sucks.

892
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:10,380
Is it here?

893
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:12,800
This way.

894
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:14,620
Wait, is it?

895
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:18,980
What the fuck is it?

896
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:21,660
It says underground.

897
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:25,500
It's not this way.

898
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,120
Didn't get to be in Arkham City?

899
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:31,240
Didn't Batman smash that car of his into him back at the asylum?

900
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:35,060
Where is the entrance?

901
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:36,160
Don't shoot!

902
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:36,860
Don't shoot!

903
01:19:40,660 --> 01:19:41,840
I was just at it?

904
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:42,240
Here?

905
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:43,700
Is somewhere here?

906
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:47,700
No, it goes...

907
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:49,180
32?

908
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,200
Is it above me?

909
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:54,900
There's a subway?

910
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:59,160
The fuck's the subway entrance?

911
01:20:05,530 --> 01:20:07,030
Oh, there's the subway.

912
01:20:07,190 --> 01:20:07,870
There it is.

913
01:20:09,130 --> 01:20:11,910
But the gate is because the gate was closed, guys.

914
01:20:12,470 --> 01:20:14,030
Never don't jump the gates.

915
01:20:14,830 --> 01:20:17,650
Can I do that?

916
01:20:18,070 --> 01:20:20,490
It never said anything about working on the ground.

917
01:20:21,170 --> 01:20:21,670
Yeah, they work.

918
01:20:22,430 --> 01:20:23,210
Oh, you guys know.

919
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:26,230

01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:05,840
I'm not doing the real shit that guy's like I'm not enabling his behavior

925
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:13,220
It's not for me.

926
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,800
Oh, is that like cat women's?

927
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:22,000

Explode!

931
01:21:49,890 --> 01:21:50,050
Oops.

932
01:21:51,270 --> 01:21:52,150
Wrong one.

933
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:55,240
Oh, why won't it explode?

934
01:21:57,490 --> 01:21:58,710
Oh, there we go.

935
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:00,850
I just pressed it right.

936
01:22:02,570 --> 01:22:06,130
Oh my god, guess how well do your stupid Ridley shit.

937
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:15,980
I forgot you had to hold left and then hold left button and then right button.

938
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:19,300
Where else do we go?

939
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:20,560
I guess we go downstairs?

940
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:28,670
Hello, hello!

941
01:22:30,890 --> 01:22:33,190
I'm in your vents.

942
01:22:36,450 --> 01:22:37,330
With me, Batman!

943
01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:43,930
Oh my god, goddamn fucking Riddler.

944
01:22:46,690 --> 01:22:50,570
I want to know how much money he spent in doing this.

945
01:22:50,770 --> 01:22:52,490
Like, he's just doing it for the fun of it.

946
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:57,510
He's just putting trophies everywhere.

947
01:22:58,630 --> 01:22:59,370
That's it.

948
01:23:00,670 --> 01:23:02,610
He's not even committing any crime.

949
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:05,490
He's just being very annoying.

950
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:10,780
Yeah.

951
01:23:11,180 --> 01:23:14,160
This panel is protected using Tiger encryption protocols.

952
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:18,460
I can't decrypt it without access to the master control program strange uses.

953
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:19,080
All right.

954
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:22,900
I gotta get to the master control panel then.

955
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:23,880
Oh, awesome.

956
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:24,460
Chat.

957
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:26,280
Fix that real quick.

958
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:29,460
He's fixing chat real quick.

959
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:31,540
Because I can't see chat.

960
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:36,080
He just wants you to have fun.

961
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:47,320
The only crime he's committing is just trespassing.

962
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:51,500
What is this?

963
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:53,440
Where am I now?

964
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:54,240

Solomon Grundy?

967
01:24:36,890 --> 01:24:38,270
That's the stupidest name I've ever heard.

968
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:40,310
That's the thing you can hear in the museum.

969
01:24:40,670 --> 01:24:42,830
You know, Solomon Grundy born under my name.

970
01:24:42,830 --> 01:24:43,850
But he's in this game?

971
01:24:44,010 --> 01:24:44,770
You may be right.

972
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:49,420
Oh shit.

973
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:52,080
Like all the classics are here.

974
01:24:53,980 --> 01:24:54,560
Hey guys.

975
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,660
Breaking another sound wave.

976
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:04,220
I love Solomon.

977
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:18,500
Oh, he's Solomon Grundy is pretty is a pretty silly character I think the only thing I know but honestly the only thing I know much about I don't know if like it's very accurate but the only thing I know about Solomon Grundy is from the Justice League show

978
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,540
Oh, it's just a reference.

979
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:37,640
Oh, it's unlucky Good I always wanted a chance to go up against that freak Oh, and also injustice too the injustice mobile game not that Not the flood, not the consulate.

980
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:43,260
Kill Batman, drag this thing to Joker, turn it on, and go back to Cobble Pot as heroes.

981
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:43,800
What?

982
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:45,220
Just like that.

983
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:46,360
Kill Batman.

984
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:48,680
Yeah, it can't be that hard, right?

985
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:51,140
He just got, just kill Batman.

986
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:52,400
He's nothing.

987
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:59,920
If that disruptor stops working, Batman will be free to stroll right into my lovely museum.

988
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:05,120
And if you let that happen, I'll let you all get to see what I'm keeping up with.

989
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:06,880
to the iceberg lounge.

990
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:07,400
Yoink!

991
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:08,780
Got you now.

992
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:10,720
Got you nose.

993
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:13,600
Oh, shit.

994
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,500
Wait, how do you know?

995
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:19,140
Alright.

996
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:22,780
I love breaking the sound barrier.

997
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:28,600
Yeah, which way?

998
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:29,240
Pop!

999
01:26:30,580 --> 01:26:31,260
That's right.

1000
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:32,720
Round of bullshit!

1001
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:34,580
Can your gun hide from this?

1002
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:36,900
Alright.

1003
01:26:40,150 --> 01:26:42,150
The only counter, the gun.

1004
01:26:43,710 --> 01:26:44,790
That's the last guy.

1005
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:54,440
Let us start fisting.

1006
01:26:56,860 --> 01:26:58,880
Who the fuck cares about the grapple?

1007
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:03,800
Why the fuck did I upgrade the grappling gun disarm when I literally have a battered?

1008
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:07,700
I feel like I feel like battered is so much easier.

1009
01:27:08,660 --> 01:27:09,140
It works.

1010
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:10,560
If it works, it works.

1011
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:12,460
I should be able to get into the museum now.

1012
01:27:12,740 --> 01:27:13,520
How do I get out of here?

1013
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:18,020
Wait, how do I get out of here?

1014
01:27:19,540 --> 01:27:22,260
I don't remember how I got here.

1015
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:26,980
I'm so lost.

1016
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:31,920
Um...

1017
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:34,620
I should be allowed to just break through that glass, right?

1018
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:40,380
I think it was this way.

1019
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:42,620
I just gotta backtrack my way back.

1020
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:46,580
Okay.

1021
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:47,820
Oh, it was this way.

1022
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:48,620
Okay, there you go.

1023
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:49,600
It was an event.

1024
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:51,960
This is... Oh, my God.

1025
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:53,200
Oh, I thought I broke the game.

1026
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:54,940
Let's do this little hole.

1027
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:58,720
That's expensive glass.

1028
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:01,340
And I'm literally motherfucking Bruce Wayne!

1029
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:04,760
Nothing is expensive.

1030
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:07,900
What the hell is happening down there?

1031
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:08,880
Hello?

1032
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:10,820
Is someone gonna answer me?

1033
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:12,940
I'll give you one simple task.

1034
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:22,100
Oh, don't worry.

1035
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:23,120
I definitely did.

1036
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:41,920
I can literally write a paycheck to solve all my problems.

1037
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:42,520
Oh, hey.

1038
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:44,660
Really need this?

1039
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:52,480
Like, whoops, property damage?

1040
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:53,460
That's alright.

1041
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:55,360
Here's $8 million.

1042
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:58,840
What does Wayne Industry do anyway?

1043
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:04,000
Wait, now that I think about it, what the fuck does Wayne Industry even make?

1044
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:12,180
Every...

1045
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:39,100
everything like i never really realized like what the fuck does wayne industry do they just make money private equity on you know stuff wait does that mean he sells weapons to like the middle east like i'm

1046
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:48,060
Do you think Batboose Wayne is a really bad person?

1047
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:53,940
Isn't that what Iron Man did?

1048
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:56,060
I remember the first Iron Man movie.

1049
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:59,280
Like Tony Stark used to sell weapons.

1050
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:01,520
In war.

1051
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,800
Yeah, just like Stark.

1052
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,660
Isn't that what fucking Tony Stark did?

1053
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:08,080
And then he got kidnapped.

1054
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:08,760
I was like, wait.

1055
01:30:09,340 --> 01:30:11,660
Wait, this is actually a really bad thing.

1056
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,240
Just like art.

1057
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:17,060
Yeah, that's that's what Tony Stark did.

1058
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:19,480
Is that what Bruce Wayne do does too?

1059
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:30,780
It's like who the fuck am I sell who the fuck is Bruce Wayne selling his weapons to?

1060
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:40,300
Yeah, Tony Stark was an asshole.

1061
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:42,240
Oh, just tech.

1062
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:44,700
Okay, but like what kind of tech though?

1063
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:46,600
Wait, that's a helicopter.

1064
01:30:47,060 --> 01:30:48,380
Is that a bad helicopter?

1065
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:52,540
a good hello oh i guess we'll never know

1066
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:08,440
all right it's five zero visual on target i repeat we have lost sight of that

1067
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:29,800
i don't know it could feel like he's just chilling the person at the helicopter it's like who the fuck does wane industry even sells like Sell his their tech.

1068
01:31:39,340 --> 01:31:41,920
I think it's bio.

1069
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:44,320
That does not make it any better.

1070
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:49,040
Bioterism is not a good thing.

1071
01:31:59,820 --> 01:32:00,760
Jesus Christ.

1072
01:32:10,770 --> 01:32:14,010
What the

1073
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:18,400
fuck?

1074
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:19,620
Who did that?

1075
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:21,080
Oh, hey.

1076
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:21,380
guys.

1077
01:32:27,660 --> 01:32:30,840
Did not mean to kill you, but we were just there.

1078
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:33,860
We were there at the wrong time.

1079
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:36,140
That what?

1080
01:32:37,820 --> 01:32:39,120
Tamer down in sector one.

1081
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:40,760
This ain't over.

1082
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:41,700
No way.

1083
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:43,020
Oh, it's here.

1084
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:45,360
Hey guys.

1085
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:47,140
No.

1086
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:50,580
There we go.

1087
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:53,720
Taylor here.

1088
01:32:56,740 --> 01:32:57,820
Get out of here.

1089
01:32:58,180 --> 01:32:59,260
Get your ass out of here.

1090
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:04,900
Oh my god, there's so many things going on in my screen.

1091
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:10,140
That's fucking right.

1092
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:13,200
I know all the kung fu.

1093
01:33:19,250 --> 01:33:20,110
Wait, can I just leave?

1094
01:33:20,330 --> 01:33:20,470
Wait.

1095
01:33:21,610 --> 01:33:22,970
Oh, I have to secure the area.

1096
01:33:23,370 --> 01:33:25,530
I was like, can I just like walk away?

1097
01:33:25,950 --> 01:33:26,850
I just leave?

1098
01:33:28,350 --> 01:33:29,230
That's fucking right.

1099
01:33:29,370 --> 01:33:29,870
Get out of here.

1100
01:33:30,190 --> 01:33:36,690
I just opened the door.

1101
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:45,460
Yeah.

1102
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:48,280
Wait, voicemail?

1103
01:33:49,660 --> 01:33:50,820
Send me a voicemail?

1104
01:34:26,180 --> 01:34:26,400
What?

1105
01:34:27,980 --> 01:34:28,660
That's it?

1106
01:34:32,150 --> 01:34:34,380
What the fuck does he mean by that?

1107
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:41,000
As a wise man once said, Batman doesn't kill.

1108
01:34:41,180 --> 01:34:44,160
But you never know when he plans to start, do you?

1109
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:47,100
Thank you for the Super chat.

1110
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:47,600
Thank you.

1111
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:48,400
Thank you.

1112
01:34:49,020 --> 01:34:51,600
I saw a comic panel from Injustice.

1113
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:56,000
And then it was like the panel where Super I was about to kill Joker.

1114
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:58,440
And he was like, Bruce, not now.

1115
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:00,280
And the Joker was like, Bruce.

1116
01:35:00,740 --> 01:35:02,740
But he's like about to fucking die.

1117
01:35:02,900 --> 01:35:04,720
And he's like, oh my god, I did it.

1118
01:35:04,980 --> 01:35:07,460
I finally know his secret identity.

1119
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:09,500
It's soon.

1120
01:35:11,020 --> 01:35:13,160
He's like, I'm just about to die.

1121
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:19,160
But oh my God I fight figuring it out it's Bruce Wayne

1122
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:27,760
I thought he would let me crash through that window I guess not

1123
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:49,120
whoa what the fuck over 65 million years ago all visitors with a valid ticket are confessing Hello?

1124
01:35:50,820 --> 01:35:52,920
Oh, it was just acting.

1125
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:55,100
Okay.

1126
01:35:56,660 --> 01:35:58,360
I was gonna be like, what the fuck?

1127
01:35:58,580 --> 01:36:00,380
Is this Jurassic Park now?

1128
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:06,980
I haven't had jumpscares.

1129
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:09,060
I'm so confused.

1130
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:13,500
What is he doing?

1131
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:15,160
Weeeeee!

1132
01:36:18,370 --> 01:36:19,790
Man, he's here!

1133
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:23,770
Oh shit!

1134
01:36:24,890 --> 01:36:31,030
Oh my, I'm trying to...

1135
01:36:32,110 --> 01:36:32,810
What the fuck?

1136
01:36:33,250 --> 01:36:33,250
Stop!

1137
01:36:35,350 --> 01:36:36,410
What the fuck am I using?

1138
01:36:37,730 --> 01:36:38,610
Oh, explosive jet!

1139
01:36:38,670 --> 01:36:41,270
Wait, that's even better than batter ends.

1140
01:36:42,230 --> 01:36:44,810
Wait, I didn't do that!

1141
01:36:50,990 --> 01:36:51,650
Explosive jet!

1142
01:36:56,410 --> 01:36:57,310
That's right!

1143
01:36:58,110 --> 01:37:00,070
$20 million, God!

1144
01:37:01,270 --> 01:37:02,610
But worth it!

1145
01:37:08,980 --> 01:37:10,000
Does this kill?

1146
01:37:10,220 --> 01:37:11,000
I can't tell.

1147
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:13,440
I don't think it does.

1148
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:14,760
I think it just does.

1149
01:37:15,220 --> 01:37:16,260
But it's so silly.

1150
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:23,600
Okay, let's get this over here.

1151
01:37:30,510 --> 01:37:31,710
Alright, where are you?

1152
01:37:32,670 --> 01:37:34,990
We gotta get this over with.

1153
01:37:36,050 --> 01:37:37,590
I mean, I can...

1154
01:37:39,150 --> 01:37:40,030
Alright.

1155
01:37:40,630 --> 01:37:43,390
$20 million gone from Wayne Industries.

1156
01:37:45,370 --> 01:37:46,190
What's that?

1157
01:37:48,590 --> 01:37:49,070
Hello?

1158
01:38:02,850 --> 01:38:04,930
What the fuck?

1159
01:38:06,230 --> 01:38:08,130
Oh, did she... is it like...

1160
01:38:10,150 --> 01:38:12,970
Oh my god, wait, his collection is people!

1161
01:38:19,180 --> 01:38:20,500
He's like the collector!

1162
01:38:32,250 --> 01:38:34,630
Oh, is this like one of Joker's goons?

1163
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:44,100
Man, you look taxidermy, I'll just leave.

1164
01:38:47,140 --> 01:38:47,880
I don't live!

1165
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:50,240
Is that the ventriloquist?

1166
01:38:57,860 --> 01:39:00,360
I assume that's one of the ventriloquists, right?

1167
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:13,500
What's over there?

1168
01:39:14,780 --> 01:39:14,780
Oops.

1169
01:39:15,740 --> 01:39:16,740
Yeah, Scarface, yeah.

1170
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:20,480
Wait, is she alive?

1171
01:39:31,010 --> 01:39:32,550
Oh, wait, no, she's not alive.

1172
01:39:32,710 --> 01:39:33,250
She's dead.

1173
01:39:37,030 --> 01:39:37,510
Wait, what's up?

1174
01:39:38,730 --> 01:39:41,190
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, I saved him.

1175
01:39:41,270 --> 01:39:43,230
I was like, wait, what the fuck?

1176
01:39:43,330 --> 01:39:44,510
He's just standing there.

1177
01:39:46,550 --> 01:39:47,810
I don't think she's alive.

1178
01:39:49,550 --> 01:39:51,870
No, she's definitely dead.

1179
01:39:51,990 --> 01:39:53,870
Wait, is she actually alive?

1180
01:39:55,190 --> 01:39:56,930
Why is she just standing there?

1181
01:39:59,130 --> 01:40:01,570
This would be the jewel in my collection.

1182
01:40:01,570 --> 01:40:02,070
That's me.

1183
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:11,760
How do you check her vitals?

1184
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:16,340
I can only scan her.

1185
01:40:20,810 --> 01:40:22,070
Oh, is she just meditating?

1186
01:40:23,510 --> 01:40:25,730
Oh, I thought she'd be like, taxidermeter.

1187
01:40:33,660 --> 01:40:35,180
Oh, yeah, she is alive.

1188
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:35,860
She's moving.

1189
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:40,560
You're safe for now.

1190
01:40:40,700 --> 01:40:41,060
I did it.

1191
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:41,640
I'm a hero.

1192
01:40:42,840 --> 01:41:14,020
You may want to hold off on thanking him until after you've answered my question who are you sorry man I'm a cop Gordon's innocent here I'm from the 13th precinct part of the strike team been in here since the beginning if Gordon sent you you'll know the code oh yeah yeah he said oh man what was it hmm the code now hmm it's racist he said to tell you the code is Sarah You're safe,

1193
01:41:14,340 --> 01:41:14,500
officer.

1194
01:41:15,180 --> 01:41:16,200
It's Jones, Batman.

1195
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:17,540
Elvis Jones.

1196
01:41:18,660 --> 01:41:21,060
Gordon always said he planned on sending your team in.

1197
01:41:21,660 --> 01:41:22,880
He wanted to know what was going on.

1198
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:24,840
Friendly, non-lethal explosions.

1199
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:26,320
Think of this reach out.

1200
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:27,560
Absolutely, thank you.

1201
01:41:27,620 --> 01:41:28,660
Hopefully, you still are.

1202
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:29,700
It's like sea stills.

1203
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:30,400
Invincible.

1204
01:41:30,780 --> 01:41:31,220
Invincible.

1205
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:35,280
Every time he teleports, it costs like $500,000 to taxpayer your money.

1206
01:41:35,460 --> 01:41:36,080
I'll find them.

1207
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:42,120
Elvis is alive.

1208
01:41:48,690 --> 01:41:57,890
Okay, rescue Mr. or freeze from penguin rescue remaining undercover is that like optional oh Jesus Christ

1209
01:42:01,070 --> 01:42:07,900
okay I hope that's optional

1210
01:42:12,220 --> 01:42:26,920
it's required I mean he wouldn't know we could just hire more police officers we don't I mean, they don't even do most of the work in Gotham anyway.

1211
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:29,860
I do most of the work in this goddamn city.

1212
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:32,940
So that's the scanner.

1213
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,480
We gotta disable it somewhere.

1214
01:42:41,870 --> 01:42:43,330
New recruits this way?

1215
01:42:48,630 --> 01:42:51,110
Like, I don't think it makes much of a difference.

1216
01:42:53,990 --> 01:42:57,110
In Gotham City, if they're missing one or two more cops.

1217
01:43:02,620 --> 01:43:03,100
What?

1218
01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:07,520
A remote controlled battery can hit switches that are out of reach.

1219
01:43:09,900 --> 01:43:12,020
Like, where do I- oh, it's up here.

1220
01:43:12,140 --> 01:43:14,400
I was gonna say, where do I- fuck do I throw it?

1221
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:18,520
I don't remember how to fucking control this.

1222
01:43:21,340 --> 01:43:21,820
Okay.

1223
01:43:24,780 --> 01:43:26,160
Alright, it's this way.

1224
01:43:32,890 --> 01:43:33,850
First try.

1225
01:43:41,180 --> 01:43:42,180
Let her go.

1226
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:46,640
Oh, there's...

1227
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:47,420
Oh, no, that's cute.

1228
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:48,920
It's a family portrait.

1229
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:52,300
Before his parents, I guess, like, kill themselves.

1230
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:54,160
Is that cute?

1231
01:43:56,520 --> 01:43:57,980
The gladiator pit.

1232
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:02,280
Help me?

1233
01:44:12,270 --> 01:44:14,550
I wouldn't do that if I was you.

1234
01:44:16,750 --> 01:44:18,090
Show him what we got.

1235
01:44:21,910 --> 01:44:26,310
Bro, how did he get so many of the cops?

1236
01:44:26,530 --> 01:44:27,390
You're here for the cops.

1237
01:44:28,250 --> 01:44:28,970
The ice man.

1238
01:44:29,170 --> 01:44:30,370
Yay, one less to save.

1239
01:44:30,830 --> 01:44:32,450
Oh my god, it's daddy Davido.

1240
01:44:33,710 --> 01:44:36,210
I was only here for freeze and the hostages.

1241
01:44:37,010 --> 01:44:40,590
But now I'm taking you down too.

1242
01:44:41,410 --> 01:44:43,710
Oh, aren't you scary?

1243
01:44:48,390 --> 01:44:51,350

1244
01:44:54,440 --> 01:46:19,920

01:46:20,780 --> 01:46:25,120
you know, I thought it'd be like six, but then he literally sent out like 50 people.

1246
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:28,900
I'm, I'm in the, I'm actually in the pit right now.

1247
01:46:34,470 --> 01:46:35,350
Jesus Christ.

1248
01:46:36,190 --> 01:46:38,210
Thank God they're like, they're like level one.

1249
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:41,650
They're like level one mob mobster.

1250
01:46:43,330 --> 01:46:45,290
And I'm the level 100 crime boss.

1251
01:46:45,290 --> 01:46:52,930
All right, oh no, I have a concussion right now from the hammer.

1252
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:03,100
Nice.

1253
01:47:05,680 --> 01:47:06,300
Hey, hey, hey.

1254
01:47:06,740 --> 01:47:08,120
I'm trying to give this guy a concussion.

1255
01:47:14,060 --> 01:47:16,540
He said this is my little corner.

1256
01:47:20,120 --> 01:47:21,280
Get out of here.

1257
01:47:24,180 --> 01:47:26,880
You weren't supposed to do that, Batman.

1258
01:47:29,140 --> 01:47:30,360
You should have sent a real art.

1259
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:32,640
You should have sent 80 men instead.

1260
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:35,300
You're forcing me to bring out the big guys.

1261
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:35,940
Oh, shit.

1262
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:36,860
What's that?

1263
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:41,620
Oh, my God.

1264
01:47:42,460 --> 01:47:44,960
He really loves his right eye.

1265
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:48,120
He was very lonely in that cell.

1266
01:47:48,580 --> 01:47:52,220
Oh, it doesn't look happy to see you, Batman.

1267
01:47:52,740 --> 01:47:53,880
What the...

1268
01:47:53,980 --> 01:47:56,200
Look, he was very lonely.

1269
01:47:57,300 --> 01:47:58,380
Is that Bane?

1270
01:48:03,110 --> 01:48:03,690
Wait.

1271
01:48:04,610 --> 01:48:05,450
Holy shit.

1272
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:15,380
What the fuck am I doing?

1273
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:20,440
Titan smash!

1274
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:26,320
Titan smash!

1275
01:48:29,980 --> 01:48:30,580
Okay.

1276
01:48:33,940 --> 01:48:34,800
Wait, I can level up.

1277
01:48:34,860 --> 01:48:35,860
Give me a sec, guys.

1278
01:48:36,380 --> 01:48:37,460
Free flow focus.

1279
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:39,580
When achieving a combo?

1280
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:41,120
Okay, that's way too much.

1281
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:41,840
Chee.

1282
01:48:43,120 --> 01:48:44,640
Maybe I should...

1283
01:48:44,640 --> 01:48:46,600
I feel like I should use it on...

1284
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:47,040
Oh, shit.

1285
01:48:47,180 --> 01:48:47,940
Sonic batter.

1286
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:49,900
No, that doesn't matter.

1287
01:48:50,260 --> 01:48:51,020
Maybe armor?

1288
01:48:51,260 --> 01:48:52,300
Shockwave attack?

1289
01:48:55,460 --> 01:48:56,700
Should I do more armor?

1290
01:48:57,700 --> 01:48:58,880
You should do more armor.

1291
01:49:00,540 --> 01:49:02,280
We'll do the free flow later.

1292
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:07,820
Oh my god, he broke his goddamn legs.

1293
01:49:08,160 --> 01:49:08,420
Jesus.

1294
01:49:13,820 --> 01:49:16,240
Oh my god, there's too many fucking guys around us.

1295
01:49:21,020 --> 01:49:23,100
I'm just trying to get away from all these.

1296
01:49:29,140 --> 01:49:29,460
Alright.

1297
01:49:30,580 --> 01:49:31,700
Oh, yoink.

1298
01:49:32,300 --> 01:49:32,860
Yoink.

1299
01:49:33,500 --> 01:49:33,780
Yoink.

1300
01:49:37,350 --> 01:49:38,930
Can't get me.

1301
01:49:42,130 --> 01:49:45,150
Bro, I'm trying to do my own fight here with this goddamn team.

1302
01:49:45,170 --> 01:49:46,230
Titan right now.

1303
01:49:51,230 --> 01:49:52,310
Bro, you could be a gymnast.

1304
01:49:52,570 --> 01:49:53,210
A gymnast.

1305
01:49:56,490 --> 01:49:57,090
Yeah.

1306
01:50:01,010 --> 01:50:02,370
I did it.

1307
01:50:07,350 --> 01:50:09,030
I found Penguin.

1308
01:50:09,330 --> 01:50:10,390
And Mr. Freeze.

1309
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:13,420
Not yet.

1310
01:50:14,060 --> 01:50:15,680
The situation is worse than I thought.

1311
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:18,380
Penguin has a supply of the Titan formula.

1312
01:50:18,860 --> 01:50:19,340
What?

1313
01:50:20,180 --> 01:50:21,660
Hey, welcome to Tomato Farm.

1314
01:50:21,940 --> 01:50:22,440
Welcome, welcome.

1315
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:23,340
What's going on here?

1316
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:25,260
Your SIDS bio-readings are spiking.

1317
01:50:26,300 --> 01:50:27,700
Nice of you to join us, Oracle.

1318
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:30,340
Alfred, bring Barbara up to speed.

1319
01:50:30,540 --> 01:50:31,020
Of course.

1320
01:50:31,740 --> 01:50:32,940
I'll be in touch.

1321
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:35,760
Oracle.

1322
01:50:37,860 --> 01:50:39,840
Am I going to talk to any of the Robins?

1323
01:50:40,420 --> 01:50:43,560
Like, do they exist in this Earth?

1324
01:50:45,260 --> 01:50:47,660
We've been solo this entire time.

1325
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:58,420
Oh, is she, is she like after the Joker broke her legs?

1326
01:50:59,460 --> 01:51:00,080
Yeah, that is.

1327
01:51:00,220 --> 01:51:02,580
But that all ended when Joker shot her through the spine.

1328
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:18,360
That comic book, if anyone ever seen the, because that's the infamous, they made an animated, I know they made an animated version of the comic series of where the Joker shot her in the spine.

1329
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:19,880
It's so fucked up.

1330
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:21,840
The original comic, that killing joke, yeah.

1331
01:51:21,840 --> 01:52:02,400
the killing joke is like it's like such a fucked up um um comic series i remember because like the joker wanted to do did a lot of really fucked up shit in there yeah it's really messed up but it's also like a classic because that's really like the most iconic uh cover art cover art came from with him with the camera i never watched the animated adaptation but i know the i've read the original comic series the the comic series of it oh it's here let's see where the fuck is the door ow

1332
01:52:06,360 --> 01:52:27,600
I'm surprised I'm surprised that it's bad because it's like um okay there's oh god okay where's the hole I gotta find the hole oh there it is um just because the killing joke is so iconic where

1333
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:34,500
there's a hole there's a goal

1334
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:45,920
i'm out of here all

1335
01:52:50,170 --> 01:52:51,110
right time to hack

1336
01:52:56,020 --> 01:53:02,560
i'm gonna spend another million dollars on the satellite that helps me with the hacking

1337
01:53:09,160 --> 01:53:16,720
and jesus christ there's so many tools to use This is this.

1338
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:16,960
Oh.

1339
01:53:18,740 --> 01:53:20,360
Send it back down, please.

1340
01:53:21,860 --> 01:53:22,680
What the fuck?

1341
01:53:22,820 --> 01:53:24,320
Wait, how do I access this?

1342
01:53:25,140 --> 01:53:26,680
Oh, I have to stand here.

1343
01:53:29,700 --> 01:53:30,660
Oh, fuck, oh.

1344
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:33,500
Now what?

1345
01:53:35,100 --> 01:53:35,460
Oh.

1346
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:36,880
What?

1347
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:44,020
What?

1348
01:53:52,470 --> 01:53:54,550
Oh, am I supposed to blow that up?

1349
01:53:57,390 --> 01:53:59,350
I didn't realize that was drywall.

1350
01:54:04,260 --> 01:54:08,160
I'll repeat my, that's my tag, my graffiti tag right here.

1351
01:54:10,160 --> 01:54:11,540
Oh, bardo.

1352
01:54:13,180 --> 01:54:13,240
Okay.

1353
01:54:14,500 --> 01:54:17,820
I mean, what's that?

1354
01:54:20,440 --> 01:54:21,100
I can't really.

1355
01:54:22,260 --> 01:54:23,540
Okay, really want this.

1356
01:54:25,200 --> 01:54:26,460
My gang sign.

1357
01:54:27,100 --> 01:54:28,600
This is Batman territory.

1358
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:29,600
Okay.

1359
01:54:37,680 --> 01:54:40,060
I didn't suppose to do anything here.

1360
01:54:43,510 --> 01:54:44,730
I already hacked that, though.

1361
01:54:54,640 --> 01:54:59,720
So the first half of the movie is based on a different comic, and it's not great to put it like Lee.

1362
01:54:59,820 --> 01:55:01,540
The second half is actually pretty good.

1363
01:55:01,620 --> 01:55:05,200
I would assume the second half is better just because it's based off the main comic.

1364
01:55:07,180 --> 01:55:07,920
Oh, wait.

1365
01:55:09,220 --> 01:55:10,700
So thank you for the super chat, Brady.

1366
01:55:10,840 --> 01:55:11,720
Thank you, thank you.

1367
01:55:14,380 --> 01:55:15,540
Thank you, thank you.

1368
01:55:22,170 --> 01:55:23,170
Mr. Freeze?

1369
01:55:24,550 --> 01:55:26,010
I'm here to save you!

1370
01:55:26,390 --> 01:55:28,310
Stay where I can see you, Batman.

1371
01:55:29,270 --> 01:55:32,190
You wouldn't believe the fight the old snowman put up.

1372
01:55:32,810 --> 01:55:34,590
Still, I got what I wanted.

1373
01:55:35,590 --> 01:55:37,190
That's all that matters.

1374
01:55:43,740 --> 01:55:47,080
Guys, I have a feeling that I'm not saving any cops today.

1375
01:55:48,840 --> 01:55:49,440
Oh.

1376
01:55:49,900 --> 01:55:52,040
Goodbye, cop number two.

1377
01:55:55,300 --> 01:55:59,560
When you're done in here, feel free to join me in the Iceberg Lounge so I can...

1378
01:55:59,560 --> 01:56:00,860
See, I told you it was optional.

1379
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:06,200
I told you the cops were optional, guys.

1380
01:56:07,180 --> 01:56:09,380
They just happened to be dead, too.

1381
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:12,980
Oh, shit.

1382
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:13,700
Wait, you're alive?

1383
01:56:16,540 --> 01:56:17,140
Oh.

1384
01:56:18,940 --> 01:56:21,040
Is he gonna have, what's it called?

1385
01:56:21,180 --> 01:56:21,320
Please.

1386
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:22,540
Help.

1387
01:56:22,860 --> 01:56:23,840
The ice looks unstable.

1388
01:56:23,960 --> 01:56:25,940
He looks like he has frost, but...

1389
01:56:27,800 --> 01:56:28,840
It's fine.

1390
01:56:31,020 --> 01:56:31,420
Oh!

1391
01:56:34,680 --> 01:56:36,400
Oh shit, there's sharks!

1392
01:56:39,680 --> 01:56:40,800
Anyone want...

1393
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:41,140
Okay.

1394
01:56:41,720 --> 01:56:41,980
Alright.

1395
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:43,540
It was not fine.

1396
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:45,520
Not...

1397
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:48,220
How was I supposed to know there were sharks?

1398
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:52,040
Oh, there's fishes.

1399
01:56:56,120 --> 01:56:57,200
I feel like a shark...

1400
01:56:57,200 --> 01:57:00,240
Like, how was I supposed to know how a shark would be down there?

1401
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:05,880
Yeah, I thought from, like, frostbite.

1402
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:08,200
Not because I'm shy.

1403
01:57:12,840 --> 01:57:13,280
Stay.

1404
01:57:14,060 --> 01:57:14,520
Alright.

1405
01:57:17,140 --> 01:57:18,240
Alright, now.

1406
01:57:18,760 --> 01:57:19,960
The ice looks unstable.

1407
01:57:20,360 --> 01:57:21,520
I need to move slowly.

1408
01:57:21,740 --> 01:57:22,480
Take my time.

1409
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:25,120
Try to activate this.

1410
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:28,920
How does this work?

1411
01:57:33,140 --> 01:57:35,100
Like, how the fuck does this work?

1412
01:57:47,130 --> 01:57:50,710
Oh, just move slow, okay.

1413
01:57:54,660 --> 01:57:55,720
Well, I've got you.

1414
01:57:57,520 --> 01:58:00,660
You might have- we might have to cut your toes, but that's okay.

1415
01:58:01,620 --> 01:58:07,560
You should be safe here.

1416
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:09,840
Thank you.

1417
01:58:10,220 --> 01:58:11,720
Are you from the 13th precinct?

1418
01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:13,280
Where's the rest of your team?

1419
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:14,840
There are two more guys in this room.

1420
01:58:15,980 --> 01:58:17,580
Penguin froze them up, then went after me.

1421
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:19,660
I ran and...

1422
01:58:19,660 --> 01:58:20,840
Well, I guess you saw what happened.

1423
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:22,580
I'll get them.

1424
01:58:23,260 --> 01:58:24,960
You wait here and try to warm up.

1425
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:32,120
Yeah, he definitely has frostbite.

1426
01:58:32,240 --> 01:58:32,980
There's no way.

1427
01:58:36,280 --> 01:58:36,680
Where?

1428
01:58:36,780 --> 01:58:37,540
Oh, there they are.

1429
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:40,180
Wait, is that one of them?

1430
01:58:41,900 --> 01:58:42,580
Missed.

1431
01:58:42,600 --> 01:58:42,760
Oh.

1432
01:58:43,860 --> 01:58:44,400
Oh.

1433
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:46,040
Slowly.

1434
01:58:47,200 --> 01:58:47,860
Slowly, slowly.

1435
01:58:48,280 --> 01:58:49,060
Oh shit!

1436
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:51,420
Okay.

1437
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:52,440
That's fine.

1438
01:58:53,240 --> 01:58:54,180
Sorry, Batman.

1439
01:58:54,600 --> 01:58:57,220
Did I forget to mention my little friend down there?

1440
01:58:57,680 --> 01:58:58,680
Me, tiny.

1441
01:58:59,240 --> 01:59:00,600
Who does it go?

1442
01:59:00,940 --> 01:59:02,900
It could be so useful.

1443
01:59:03,640 --> 01:59:05,320
Not me, that's for sure.

1444
01:59:05,900 --> 01:59:07,920
He's like a mobile garbage truck.

1445
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:11,100
Whatever I drop in that tank just vanishes.

1446
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:13,000
Where do I have to go?

1447
01:59:17,810 --> 01:59:19,230
What is that over there?

1448
01:59:24,670 --> 01:59:25,590
I'm gonna go this way.

1449
01:59:27,090 --> 01:59:30,170
I don't know what that is over there, but I'm gonna go this way.

1450
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:41,200
Oh, that's it?

1451
01:59:47,260 --> 01:59:47,720
What?

1452
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:50,720
I'm not supposed to save these people.

1453
01:59:56,030 --> 01:59:57,490
Like, what am I supposed to do?

1454
02:00:00,770 --> 02:00:02,410
There's like two guys over there.

1455
02:00:03,210 --> 02:00:05,290
I don't know if I can even reach them.

1456
02:00:06,650 --> 02:00:07,430
Oh, it's optional?

1457
02:00:07,670 --> 02:00:08,750
Fuck yeah, let's go.

1458
02:00:14,050 --> 02:00:15,950
I think they're dead anyway.

1459
02:00:16,210 --> 02:00:16,910
It should be fine.

1460
02:00:17,050 --> 02:00:19,390
If I leave them in the ice, they'll freeze to death.

1461
02:00:20,510 --> 02:00:21,890
You kidding me?

1462
02:00:23,650 --> 02:00:27,450
Well, like, okay, what does it, how does this benefit me, though?

1463
02:00:33,450 --> 02:00:33,970
optional.

1464
02:00:35,010 --> 02:00:36,390
We don't know that.

1465
02:00:40,650 --> 02:00:42,630
How come it won't let me grapple?

1466
02:00:43,990 --> 02:00:44,650
Oh, like this?

1467
02:00:44,770 --> 02:00:46,130
Oh, I have to do this.

1468
02:00:46,550 --> 02:00:46,750
Oh!

1469
02:00:52,630 --> 02:00:53,990
Oh, I see.

1470
02:00:54,230 --> 02:00:54,570
Okay.

1471
02:00:59,780 --> 02:01:01,380
About to break the ice, though.

1472
02:01:02,300 --> 02:01:02,720
Right?

1473
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:15,320
You know what?

1474
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:16,700
I'm so scared.

1475
02:01:33,290 --> 02:01:33,770
Oopsie.

1476
02:01:37,720 --> 02:01:41,940
I feel like it's for... I feel like it's not for now though.

1477
02:01:43,200 --> 02:01:45,060
Because I don't have a raft for this.

1478
02:01:47,820 --> 02:01:49,220
Where's the other platform?

1479
02:01:55,970 --> 02:01:57,130
Is there another platform?

1480
02:01:57,370 --> 02:01:58,510
Yeah, there's no more platforms.

1481
02:02:02,550 --> 02:02:04,770
There's this, but I don't even know if I can get there.

1482
02:02:11,940 --> 02:02:13,060
Look up?

1483
02:02:17,390 --> 02:02:18,950
I just see a stupid Riddler.

1484
02:02:20,710 --> 02:02:21,730
I see that.

1485
02:02:27,290 --> 02:02:29,150
Let's grab this real quick.

1486
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:34,300
Or is that for later?

1487
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:39,580
Can I actually cut that with a batter end?

1488
02:02:39,720 --> 02:02:40,700
Let's find out.

1489
02:02:49,730 --> 02:02:50,290
Oh!

1490
02:02:50,550 --> 02:02:51,470
I can't!

1491
02:02:51,670 --> 02:02:52,090
Nice.

1492
02:03:01,260 --> 02:03:02,660
But can I get there?

1493
02:03:08,780 --> 02:03:10,160
Well, let me get there, though.

1494
02:03:12,700 --> 02:03:13,240
That's right.

1495
02:03:13,360 --> 02:03:14,500
Best detective.

1496
02:03:18,540 --> 02:03:20,060
I can't grapple to it.

1497
02:03:24,180 --> 02:03:25,200
I can pull it.

1498
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:26,160
Okay, that's good to know.

1499
02:03:31,810 --> 02:03:33,330
I didn't realize I can pull this.

1500
02:03:34,430 --> 02:03:34,770
Alright.

1501
02:03:35,350 --> 02:03:36,210
Save him.

1502
02:03:37,130 --> 02:03:37,790
I got you.

1503
02:03:37,970 --> 02:03:39,710
I feel like he'd be dead already.

1504
02:03:39,890 --> 02:03:55,790
he definitely would have frozen by now but like all right that's cool i don't know maybe he's like some fucking super soldier i don't know how you're still alive i should cut off both your arms from prospect

1505
02:03:59,030 --> 02:04:07,090
so cold where did penguin get that gun he stole it from mr freeze i'm getting it back

1506
02:04:11,330 --> 02:04:12,310
Got you!

1507
02:04:17,660 --> 02:04:20,120
Like, I have no idea how you survived this.

1508
02:04:21,740 --> 02:04:23,040
What's over here?

1509
02:04:27,330 --> 02:04:28,770
Anything interesting here?

1510
02:04:36,500 --> 02:04:37,020
Hello?

1511
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:39,200
Wait, what's this?

1512
02:04:41,900 --> 02:04:42,500
Where am I?

1513
02:04:42,600 --> 02:04:44,480
They're using thermal imaging headsets.

1514
02:04:45,240 --> 02:04:48,020
Anyone wearing them will be able to spot me hiding up in the darkness.

1515
02:04:49,580 --> 02:04:50,020
Oh.

1516
02:04:51,580 --> 02:04:53,420
I don't even know what to do.

1517
02:04:53,640 --> 02:04:54,900
Am I supposed to go here?

1518
02:04:55,640 --> 02:04:57,460
I thought I was supposed to go to the lounge.

1519
02:04:57,580 --> 02:05:02,600
Batman's on the way and the last time I saw him, he didn't look very happy.

1520
02:05:03,440 --> 02:05:05,820
He's not getting past me and the boys, sir.

1521
02:05:06,160 --> 02:05:08,180
The suit is safe.

1522
02:05:09,120 --> 02:05:13,640
Tell the boys there's an extra hundred grand in it for whoever brings him in alive.

1523
02:05:14,020 --> 02:05:15,140
Very generous, sir.

1524
02:05:15,540 --> 02:05:17,000
Oh, that's a lot of cops.

1525
02:05:19,940 --> 02:05:21,140
Listen up.

1526
02:05:21,260 --> 02:05:22,960
Penguin wants the bad brought in.

1527
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:25,140
Listen up.

1528
02:05:27,340 --> 02:05:28,540
All right.

1529
02:05:28,820 --> 02:05:29,280
Smoke bomb.

1530
02:05:29,940 --> 02:05:30,440
I'll be back.

1531
02:05:32,200 --> 02:05:33,100
That's right.

1532
02:05:33,640 --> 02:05:34,720
Can't see shit.

1533
02:05:36,140 --> 02:05:36,920
Which way?

1534
02:05:37,100 --> 02:05:37,540
You'll never...

1535
02:05:37,540 --> 02:05:38,120
Oh, I'm dead.

1536
02:05:40,940 --> 02:05:41,280
Okay.

1537
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:45,240
Maybe it wasn't smart for me to go straight in.

1538
02:05:50,180 --> 02:05:50,620
All right.

1539
02:05:50,680 --> 02:05:51,980
This time I'll stealth it.

1540
02:05:52,060 --> 02:05:52,500
Watch this.

1541
02:05:55,700 --> 02:05:56,220
Okay,

1542
02:06:03,690 --> 02:06:04,110
for real.

1543
02:06:04,330 --> 02:06:04,730
Oh, shit.

1544
02:06:05,110 --> 02:06:05,770
Oh, shit.

1545
02:06:06,650 --> 02:06:07,770
Okay, give me a sec.

1546
02:06:10,490 --> 02:06:11,370
Okay, this is not good.

1547
02:06:11,630 --> 02:06:12,770
This is not good.

1548
02:06:14,890 --> 02:06:15,710
This is not good.

1549
02:06:16,130 --> 02:06:16,290
This is not good.

1550
02:06:16,290 --> 02:06:16,750
Oh, my God.

1551
02:06:16,970 --> 02:06:17,790
This is not good.

1552
02:06:19,790 --> 02:06:22,330
You think I need last me?

1553
02:06:24,590 --> 02:06:24,950
Okay.

1554
02:06:25,230 --> 02:06:26,410
He doesn't know.

1555
02:06:26,430 --> 02:06:33,190
He doesn't know Where could I be?

1556
02:06:33,690 --> 02:06:36,410
I don't know Oh

1557
02:06:39,980 --> 02:06:43,200
yeah My

1558
02:06:49,980 --> 02:07:09,870
Okay I didn't think I could get shot out in the middle of my takedown game This time This time Stealth is not off I figured it out.

1559
02:07:10,270 --> 02:07:10,930
Listen to me, Pig.

1560
02:07:11,370 --> 02:07:15,390
The only reason you're still alive is so Batman has someone to come and save.

1561
02:07:16,330 --> 02:07:18,430
Yeah, when he does, I'm gonna blow his car.

1562
02:07:18,790 --> 02:07:19,430
Who's screaming?

1563
02:07:20,190 --> 02:07:20,930
That's right.

1564
02:07:21,130 --> 02:07:23,710
Who could it be?

1565
02:07:27,430 --> 02:07:28,530
What happened to you?

1566
02:07:29,030 --> 02:07:30,090
How come you're up there?

1567
02:07:30,630 --> 02:07:31,090

1568
02:07:31,290 --> 02:07:31,830
Help me down!

1569
02:07:32,490 --> 02:07:34,350

We did it.

1573
02:08:25,250 --> 02:08:25,850
They know.

1574
02:08:26,310 --> 02:08:28,830
They're almost as confused as Toki.

1575
02:08:29,350 --> 02:08:31,010
Thank you for the super chat.

1576
02:08:31,310 --> 02:08:31,630
Absolutely.

Thank you.

1578
02:08:32,550 --> 02:08:33,890
Kel, thank you for the super chat.

1579
02:08:34,050 --> 02:08:34,170
Thank you.

1580
02:08:34,290 --> 02:08:34,690
Thank you.

1581
02:08:34,690 --> 02:08:36,350
Hey, Toki, I just fell to shit.

1582
02:08:36,490 --> 02:08:38,630
Oh, the lava makes me feel better seeing you streaming.

1583
02:08:39,110 --> 02:08:39,930
Thanks for everything you did.

1584
02:08:40,050 --> 02:08:40,890
Thank you for the super chat.

1585
02:08:40,970 --> 02:08:41,070
Thank you.

1586
02:08:41,090 --> 02:08:41,530
Thank you.

1587
02:08:41,810 --> 02:08:46,350
I hope the next lab you'll do better, but I'm glad to cheer you up, man.

1588
02:08:46,770 --> 02:08:47,590
I think it was Super Chat.

1589
02:08:47,670 --> 02:08:48,190
Thank you, thank you.

1590
02:08:48,990 --> 02:08:51,350
But I should see if they have any information on Penguin.

1591
02:08:51,570 --> 02:08:51,930
Oh, okay.

1592
02:08:52,850 --> 02:08:57,010
I was trying to go back because I forgot to go to the Mr. Freeze lounge.

1593
02:08:59,350 --> 02:09:02,190
They never saw it coming.

1594
02:09:03,710 --> 02:09:05,490
Pure self-gameplay right there.

1595
02:09:05,890 --> 02:09:06,490
You're part of Gordon's strike team.

1596
02:09:06,990 --> 02:09:07,850
I've seen your file.

1597
02:09:09,130 --> 02:09:09,530
You have?

1598
02:09:09,950 --> 02:09:11,450
I mean, yes, sir.

1599
02:09:12,050 --> 02:09:14,230
Cabal Pots turned this place into a fortress.

1600
02:09:15,590 --> 02:09:16,550
Someone ratted us out.

1601
02:09:16,890 --> 02:09:20,950
Me and the boys got grabbed, brought here, and beaten the crap out of.

1602
02:09:21,150 --> 02:09:22,590
The other thing you was super chat, the other thing?

1603
02:09:22,950 --> 02:09:23,250
Yeah.

1604
02:09:23,410 --> 02:09:25,630
There are just two more of you unaccounted for.

1605
02:09:26,190 --> 02:09:26,850
There's two more?

1606
02:09:27,770 --> 02:09:30,170
Cabal Pots like to take us in there to beat us up somewhere.

1607
02:09:30,230 --> 02:09:31,530
Yeah, it's near the Ice Pots lounge.

1608
02:09:31,950 --> 02:09:32,810
That's where they are.

1609
02:09:33,190 --> 02:09:34,670
That's why I wanted to go first.

1610
02:09:36,610 --> 02:09:40,930
This area is so... This map is crazy big.

1611
02:09:41,810 --> 02:10:15,250
room no one in or out well what about the little bastard that did this to us i want payback you'll get the rest of the squad and then we get our payback i miss when maps were like this detailed instead of like copy and paste there's so many little references to like um there's so many little references to like bits and parts of other uh like stuff in batman it's really really cool.

1612
02:10:15,770 --> 02:10:16,330
I like that.

1613
02:10:16,530 --> 02:10:17,930
Oh, I didn't see this.

1614
02:10:20,990 --> 02:10:21,870
God fucking!

1615
02:10:23,950 --> 02:10:25,250
Get me out of here.

1616
02:10:26,130 --> 02:10:27,210
Riddle me this!

1617
02:10:28,390 --> 02:10:30,510
Fuck off, Riddle me!

1618
02:10:30,510 --> 02:10:32,310
I don't want to riddle me this.

1619
02:10:32,330 --> 02:10:33,450
You guys all out of the ice, Batman.

1620
02:10:34,170 --> 02:10:34,850
We owe you big.

1621
02:10:44,460 --> 02:10:45,340
Hello, Batman.

1622
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:46,720
Can you hear me?

1623
02:10:47,180 --> 02:10:48,180
Of course you can.

1624
02:10:49,660 --> 02:10:52,880
Thought you'd like a little- Yeah, there's a lot of passion in the level this out.

1625
02:10:54,120 --> 02:10:57,680
It's like there's like areas where it's like it's just lore.

1626
02:10:59,160 --> 02:11:01,820
There's nothing like um important.

1627
02:11:01,980 --> 02:11:02,980
There's no reason to go there.

1628
02:11:03,200 --> 02:11:05,280
It's just to explore the lore of the area.

1629
02:11:05,340 --> 02:11:06,780
Let's hear him squeal.

1630
02:11:08,640 --> 02:11:09,260
Oh shit!

1631
02:11:09,320 --> 02:11:15,720
What happened is the sound of an undercover cop having his fingers frozen to sub-zero temperatures.

1632
02:11:16,860 --> 02:11:17,720
Oh god.

1633
02:11:18,140 --> 02:11:22,420
I wonder what would happen if I take this hammer and- I should stop this.

1634
02:11:22,900 --> 02:11:24,180
What do you know?

1635
02:11:24,540 --> 02:11:26,280
His whole bloody hand explodes.

1636
02:11:26,300 --> 02:11:27,840
Holy fuck, Penguin.

1637
02:11:28,900 --> 02:11:30,240
Shoot him already.

1638
02:11:31,080 --> 02:11:32,560
I should stop this.

1639
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:34,240
Slowly walks over.

1640
02:11:42,170 --> 02:11:43,450
Let's see.

1641
02:11:47,180 --> 02:11:49,160
Alright, you should be in here.

1642
02:11:51,480 --> 02:11:51,800
Yes.

1643
02:11:52,740 --> 02:11:53,080
That's me.

1644
02:11:54,680 --> 02:11:55,560
Oh!

1645
02:11:56,600 --> 02:11:56,980
Shit!

1646
02:11:57,440 --> 02:12:00,680
Oh my god, I thought you were gonna fucking get a monologue!

1647
02:12:01,360 --> 02:12:02,600
The weapon is too powerful.

1648
02:12:03,020 --> 02:12:05,460
The only person who knows the gun's weakness is Freeze.

1649
02:12:05,720 --> 02:12:06,820
What the fuck?

1650
02:12:07,480 --> 02:12:09,740
I thought you were gonna monologue!

1651
02:12:16,690 --> 02:12:18,370
Okay, so fuck me.

1652
02:12:18,570 --> 02:12:20,110
I'm not allowed to go here.

1653
02:12:21,710 --> 02:12:24,410
Oh my god, don't fuck off, bro.

1654
02:12:27,030 --> 02:12:29,010
Yeah, where's the villain monologue?

1655
02:12:33,350 --> 02:12:35,170
He was talking to me!

1656
02:12:36,050 --> 02:12:38,270
I need to find a way to disable his gun.

1657
02:12:38,930 --> 02:12:40,290
Maybe its maker will have the answer.

1658
02:12:40,810 --> 02:12:41,610
Where is his maker?

1659
02:12:47,270 --> 02:12:49,030
I don't see anyone.

1660
02:12:49,130 --> 02:12:50,950
I don't see Mr. Freeze anywhere.

1661
02:13:04,540 --> 02:13:05,800
Where'd they put him?

1662
02:13:06,900 --> 02:13:08,320
Oh, he's dead, dead.

1663
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,160
I assume like he's not here.

1664
02:13:16,380 --> 02:13:17,180
Oh, fuck.

1665
02:13:17,820 --> 02:13:19,060
I should go find trees.

1666
02:13:19,460 --> 02:13:21,340
See if he knows how to defeat his own weapon.

1667
02:13:25,500 --> 02:13:26,300
Yeah, but...

1668
02:13:26,300 --> 02:13:27,100
Alright, goodbye.

1669
02:13:34,740 --> 02:13:36,060
Like, is it not here?

1670
02:13:41,010 --> 02:13:41,590
Oh, wait.

1671
02:13:41,670 --> 02:13:42,290
There's a...

1672
02:13:42,290 --> 02:13:42,750
Oh, wait.

1673
02:13:42,790 --> 02:13:44,350
There's like a little opening here.

1674
02:13:44,490 --> 02:13:44,750
Wait.

1675
02:13:44,950 --> 02:13:45,950
Do you think he's on the other...

1676
02:13:45,950 --> 02:13:46,470
Is he on the other side?

1677
02:13:46,490 --> 02:13:47,450
side of that?

1678
02:13:48,430 --> 02:13:49,850
Like, I just left the room.

1679
02:13:50,170 --> 02:13:51,390
I was just like, alright, see ya.

1680
02:13:54,890 --> 02:13:56,950
I'm just like, you got this.

1681
02:13:57,210 --> 02:13:58,350
The weapon is too powerful.

1682
02:14:00,370 --> 02:14:01,530
Yeah, like, there's something here.

1683
02:14:05,390 --> 02:14:06,670
There's a room here.

1684
02:14:06,730 --> 02:14:07,950
I didn't access that room.

1685
02:14:12,290 --> 02:14:13,690
Is it not through here?

1686
02:14:17,140 --> 02:14:18,860
I haven't gone to yet?

1687
02:14:19,080 --> 02:14:21,280
Oh my god, it's literally called the fucking torture chamber.

1688
02:14:21,820 --> 02:14:22,660
Oh, here!

1689
02:14:22,900 --> 02:14:23,800
Oh, it's here!

1690
02:14:23,960 --> 02:14:24,260
Okay.

1691
02:14:25,420 --> 02:14:26,940
It's the right side.

1692
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:29,580
That's crazy.

1693
02:14:29,680 --> 02:14:31,280
That's just called the torture chamber.

1694
02:14:36,930 --> 02:14:37,450
Whoops.

1695
02:14:38,910 --> 02:14:40,830
I went a little too fast.

1696
02:14:44,010 --> 02:14:44,530
Cookies.

1697
02:14:46,210 --> 02:14:48,690
It's nice that he refreezed the ice for me, though.

1698
02:14:50,330 --> 02:14:50,850
Okay.

1699
02:14:51,050 --> 02:14:53,250
It's the goon room tab.

1700
02:15:00,280 --> 02:15:00,620
Bitch.

1701
02:15:08,700 --> 02:15:09,880
Bro, should we stop it?

1702
02:15:10,140 --> 02:15:10,480
Nah.

1703
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:13,040
He's just a fucking nerd.

1704
02:15:17,960 --> 02:15:19,880
What the fuck did he do?

1705
02:15:26,760 --> 02:15:51,720
Oh my god he got bad Let's get that bad out of here Get out of here That's right Wait what the fuck is BX Oh shit that's what BX is That's right Time for a beat down.

1706
02:15:56,850 --> 02:15:57,230
That's right.

1707
02:15:57,590 --> 02:15:58,750
You think I'm gonna stop?

1708
02:16:01,210 --> 02:16:02,470
Okay, you're right.

1709
02:16:02,730 --> 02:16:03,250
Maybe I won't.

1710
02:16:03,730 --> 02:16:04,850
You know what I can do, though?

1711
02:16:06,030 --> 02:16:06,770
Wait, what?

1712
02:16:09,330 --> 02:16:10,810
Alright, get this bat out of here.

1713
02:16:12,130 --> 02:16:12,550
What?

1714
02:16:13,990 --> 02:16:14,870
There we go.

1715
02:16:20,510 --> 02:16:23,230
Oh, you don't need that arm no more.

1716
02:16:24,570 --> 02:16:26,970
I bet being a doctor in Gotham City?

1717
02:16:27,130 --> 02:16:29,150
It pays you so fucking well.

1718
02:16:31,490 --> 02:16:33,450
Gamers don't read.

1719
02:16:36,550 --> 02:16:38,650
Who needs reading when I'm a millionaire?

1720
02:16:41,330 --> 02:16:42,370
Yeah, that arm is gone.

1721
02:16:42,490 --> 02:16:43,410
We gotta cut it.

1722
02:16:44,570 --> 02:16:45,910
We might as well just cut that arm.

1723
02:16:57,400 --> 02:16:59,080
Wait, was Batman's dad a doctor?

1724
02:16:59,680 --> 02:17:01,780
No wonder he fucking died in crime alley.

1725
02:17:04,840 --> 02:17:08,600
Wait, there's No way, his dad's a doctor and he was a billionaire.

1726
02:17:09,800 --> 02:17:10,400
Oh,

1727
02:17:13,820 --> 02:17:14,980
that's fuck.

1728
02:17:16,060 --> 02:17:19,480
Wait, Batman's dad was a doctor?

1729
02:17:21,060 --> 02:17:22,080
That's when my chat died.

1730
02:17:22,340 --> 02:17:23,120
Let me fix that.

1731
02:17:25,040 --> 02:17:25,860
I got a tab out.

1732
02:17:26,940 --> 02:17:29,080
It's like not enough memory to open this.

1733
02:17:33,630 --> 02:17:35,190
Oh my god, no wonder.

1734
02:17:35,590 --> 02:17:39,470
He's, it's literally like a get- rich quick

1735
02:17:44,100 --> 02:17:53,840

02:18:12,860 --> 02:18:13,860
I see him.

1738
02:18:16,020 --> 02:18:16,860
Oh my god.

1739
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:18,780
He like chose like...

1740
02:18:18,780 --> 02:18:22,040
Bruce's dad chose like the perfect place to live.

1741
02:18:24,040 --> 02:18:25,860
Literally infinite money glitch.

1742
02:18:35,860 --> 02:18:37,460
Holy shit.

1743
02:18:38,760 --> 02:18:39,420
Who's that?

1744
02:18:39,800 --> 02:18:41,100
Wait, he's still alive.

1745
02:18:42,860 --> 02:18:44,220
Is that Mr. Freeze?

1746
02:18:46,440 --> 02:18:47,640
Holy shit, you okay, bro?

1747
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:53,020
Oh my god, wait, that's fucked.

1748
02:18:53,220 --> 02:18:56,280
He put him in, like, fucking Bahamas.

1749
02:19:00,930 --> 02:19:02,210
What happened to you?

1750
02:19:04,510 --> 02:19:06,710
Wait, let me read this first before I help you.

1751
02:19:18,900 --> 02:19:20,980
Okay, well, how can I...

1752
02:19:20,980 --> 02:19:22,460
Oh, wait, here.

1753
02:19:23,500 --> 02:19:24,620
Well, I got you, bro.

1754
02:19:28,180 --> 02:19:28,900
Oh, sorry.

1755
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:29,620
That's hacking.

1756
02:19:30,400 --> 02:19:30,640
Oh, wait.

1757
02:19:30,660 --> 02:19:31,620
I can listen to the radio.

1758
02:19:49,960 --> 02:19:50,360
Bro,

1759
02:19:56,870 --> 02:19:57,390
it's my...

1760
02:19:57,390 --> 02:19:58,070
I got...

1761
02:19:58,070 --> 02:19:58,950
Bro, it's my 10-minute break.

1762
02:20:00,550 --> 02:20:00,950
Yeah.

1763
02:20:04,530 --> 02:20:07,470
Nice, I gotta listen to my favorite radio station, guys.

1764
02:20:14,260 --> 02:20:15,420
How do I get out of here?

1765
02:20:20,260 --> 02:20:21,040
Okay, wait.

1766
02:20:21,740 --> 02:20:23,880
I'm trying to figure out how to get out of the room.

1767
02:20:25,260 --> 02:20:27,780
All I can do is just listen to the radio.

1768
02:20:32,090 --> 02:20:33,930
I'm decoding the radio station.

1769
02:20:34,030 --> 02:20:34,810
Give me a sec.

1770
02:20:37,270 --> 02:20:38,090
Okay, there we go.

1771
02:20:38,110 --> 02:20:47,070
All right, explosives, yeah Oh shit, what the fuck?

1772
02:20:47,350 --> 02:20:50,790
Okay, guess I don't need it

1773
02:20:53,980 --> 02:20:56,900
I shall slice you into pieces.

1774
02:20:57,240 --> 02:20:57,560
It's okay.

1775
02:20:57,720 --> 02:20:58,640
I have this

1776
02:21:03,020 --> 02:21:04,880
Oh, what the fuck

1777
02:21:13,440 --> 02:21:17,760
Okay, there's like so many Oh my god.

1778
02:21:21,140 --> 02:21:23,100
He has a knife.

1779
02:21:25,500 --> 02:21:26,380
Oh god.

1780
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:31,000
I don't even know if I'm doing anything to him.

1781
02:21:31,440 --> 02:21:32,400
It's just...

1782
02:21:32,400 --> 02:21:33,220
It's just...

1783
02:21:33,220 --> 02:21:33,820
Oh shit!

1784
02:21:34,460 --> 02:21:36,880
Yeah, I'm glad Goon number four helped me out.

1785
02:21:37,960 --> 02:21:38,420
Oh yeah, I know.

1786
02:21:38,540 --> 02:21:39,160
He's dead now.

1787
02:21:39,260 --> 02:21:39,920
Yeah, he's dead.

1788
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:41,860
Thank god.

1789
02:21:42,640 --> 02:21:44,740
Thank god there's friendly fire.

1790
02:21:51,040 --> 02:21:51,520
Oh.

1791
02:21:53,720 --> 02:21:54,100
What?

1792
02:21:54,540 --> 02:21:56,100
Let me just...

1793
02:21:56,100 --> 02:21:57,120
There we go.

1794
02:21:59,600 --> 02:22:01,800
He's just standing there, yeah.

1795
02:22:02,920 --> 02:22:04,140
He's just like, are you done yet?

1796
02:22:05,040 --> 02:22:07,940
And then Goon number five threw a fucking bomb at him.

1797
02:22:08,020 --> 02:22:09,120
And I'm like, oh, that works too.

1798
02:22:09,800 --> 02:22:11,100
You know, that works.

1799
02:22:12,480 --> 02:22:14,820
It's just giving him a little back massage, you know?

1800
02:22:15,300 --> 02:22:15,780
Absolutely.

1801
02:22:16,120 --> 02:22:16,600
Thank you for the super chat.

1802
02:22:16,680 --> 02:22:16,940
Thank you.

1803
02:22:17,380 --> 02:22:17,580
Thank you.

1804
02:22:20,280 --> 02:22:22,300
Okay, now I can hack.

1805
02:22:29,100 --> 02:22:30,400
There you go.

1806
02:22:32,100 --> 02:22:33,740
Nice, first try.

1807
02:22:37,980 --> 02:22:39,020
That's it?

1808
02:22:39,740 --> 02:22:40,460
What the fuck?

1809
02:22:42,040 --> 02:22:43,640
What did that do?

1810
02:22:47,680 --> 02:22:48,480
What?

1811
02:22:50,080 --> 02:22:52,040
Oh, I was supposed to hack that.

1812
02:22:52,260 --> 02:22:52,420
Oops.

1813
02:22:55,100 --> 02:22:55,860
Wrong one.

1814
02:23:00,180 --> 02:23:01,860
There you go, microwave.

1815
02:23:09,920 --> 02:23:11,620
Can I blow up the container?

1816
02:23:12,040 --> 02:23:13,240
What does that container do?

1817
02:23:14,140 --> 02:23:14,940
Joker's cure.

1818
02:23:15,800 --> 02:23:16,480
Where is it?

1819
02:23:16,860 --> 02:23:19,120
Ah, forget the clown.

1820
02:23:19,920 --> 02:23:20,800
I want Cobbapot.

1821
02:23:21,640 --> 02:23:23,340
He has my suit, my weapons.

1822
02:23:24,220 --> 02:23:26,680
I'll end him for what he's done to me.

1823
02:23:27,260 --> 02:23:27,940
Penguin's mind.

1824
02:23:28,820 --> 02:23:32,280
You need to stay focused on that cure, or innocent people will die.

1825

It's been a pleasure, Victor.

1828
02:24:46,490 --> 02:24:47,890
Bro, give him back the money!

1829
02:24:49,310 --> 02:24:50,710

1830
02:24:51,150 --> 02:24:53,690
Bro, is there even anything left in there?

1831
02:24:56,750 --> 02:24:57,550

He doesn't kill!

1833
02:25:00,190 --> 02:25:01,690
But torture's okay.

1834
02:25:03,750 --> 02:25:05,910
What the fuck, Bruce?

1835
02:25:06,510 --> 02:25:07,630
Holy shit.

1836
02:25:08,870 --> 02:25:13,050
Do you even know how much liquid you left him?

1837
02:25:16,910 --> 02:25:20,130
Wait, does that even have enough for even five minutes?

1838
02:25:24,340 --> 02:25:27,880
Please understand he's suffering from super AIDS.

1839
02:25:28,180 --> 02:25:29,660
He's right in the head.

1840
02:25:33,100 --> 02:25:34,360
Oh, talk to him again.

1841
02:25:34,620 --> 02:25:35,320
Can I do that?

1842
02:25:36,980 --> 02:25:38,740
Sorry for torturing, buddy.

1843
02:25:39,140 --> 02:25:40,460
But, like, you want to have a chat?

1844
02:25:45,960 --> 02:25:47,620
Oh, yeah, I wanted to do this.

1845
02:25:47,840 --> 02:25:48,820
What does this do?

1846
02:25:48,940 --> 02:25:50,680
Can I...

1847
02:25:50,680 --> 02:25:53,080
Oh, let me hack this real quick, too.

1848
02:25:53,820 --> 02:25:56,140
Let me hack the Titan juice.

1849
02:26:03,910 --> 02:26:03,990
Oh.

1850
02:26:08,150 --> 02:26:10,010
That was one of the Titan containers.

1851
02:26:10,170 --> 02:26:11,570
Joker had back at Arkham Asylum.

1852
02:26:12,610 --> 02:26:13,590
What is it doing here?

1853
02:26:13,890 --> 02:26:14,590
Wait, that's it?

1854
02:26:14,950 --> 02:26:15,890
I just blow it up?

1855
02:26:16,030 --> 02:26:16,630
Oh, okay.

1856
02:26:16,790 --> 02:26:19,070
Is that part of the stuff?

1857
02:26:20,490 --> 02:26:51,170
I like some side it must be a side quest or some shit it's sorry for torturing you earlier where you want to have a chat man I thought we had a deal you'll get your suit freeze think cold thoughts while you work on that cure find my suit until I have it I will not help you all right we gotta go get his suit now oops I got a Crouch run shit.

1858
02:26:51,550 --> 02:26:52,330
There you go.

1859
02:26:54,890 --> 02:26:58,550
I could have just crawled through that, but it doesn't look as cool, I guess.

1860
02:27:05,130 --> 02:27:05,650
Wee!

1861
02:27:07,930 --> 02:27:09,210
Alright, where do I have to go?

1862
02:27:11,310 --> 02:27:12,570
Let's go this way.

1863
02:27:12,810 --> 02:27:14,550
It looks like the ice is beginning to fall.

1864
02:27:14,650 --> 02:27:15,070
Oh, nice!

1865
02:27:16,710 --> 02:27:17,610
That's convenient.

1866
02:27:21,090 --> 02:27:22,390
It's got a pole now.

1867
02:27:28,810 --> 02:27:30,150
I need to be too careful.

1868
02:27:30,390 --> 02:27:32,230
I'm just pulling the boy.

1869
02:27:35,740 --> 02:27:37,340
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1870
02:27:37,480 --> 02:27:40,320
I'll make sure I don't accidentally walk off the platform, though.

1871
02:27:41,640 --> 02:27:42,420
Yeah, that's fine.

1872
02:27:43,800 --> 02:27:45,640
I'm gonna be as close to that thing as possible.

1873
02:27:48,700 --> 02:27:51,760
Apparently I'm weak as fuck when it comes to pulling my ropes.

1874
02:27:58,600 --> 02:27:59,060
Alright.

1875
02:28:01,560 --> 02:28:03,480
Should be this to the left.

1876
02:28:06,180 --> 02:28:08,040
Oh, yeah, I was gonna say, what the fuck?

1877
02:28:08,960 --> 02:28:10,920
I want a piece of penguin when you catch him.

1878
02:28:11,860 --> 02:28:12,440
Promise me.

1879
02:28:12,880 --> 02:28:14,540
Concentrate on keeping him out of here.

1880
02:28:15,100 --> 02:28:16,260
He's a dangerous man.

1881
02:28:16,980 --> 02:28:17,760
You're emotional.

1882
02:28:18,040 --> 02:28:19,000
You'll make mistakes.

1883
02:28:19,820 --> 02:28:20,860
Leave him to me.

1884
02:28:22,360 --> 02:28:24,720
Like I said, you're emotional.

1885
02:28:25,180 --> 02:28:28,160
And then, like, so you can't deal with penguin.

1886
02:28:28,460 --> 02:28:31,240
And I literally just, like, ripped out this man's life support.

1887
02:28:31,860 --> 02:28:33,760
Because I was suffering from super AIDS.

1888
02:28:34,720 --> 02:28:37,080
So that's the famous free-suit.

1889
02:28:43,280 --> 02:28:44,280
Oh, what are you doing?

1890
02:28:46,600 --> 02:28:48,920
When I leave here, wait 10 minutes.

1891
02:28:49,340 --> 02:28:50,500
Then get this over to freeze.

1892
02:28:51,040 --> 02:28:52,160
He won't be dangerous.

1893
02:28:53,340 --> 02:28:54,240
No problem, Batman.

1894
02:29:04,180 --> 02:29:04,480
Hmm?

1895
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:09,980
What a fun.

1896
02:29:13,300 --> 02:29:14,940
Oh, what's that?

1897
02:29:19,540 --> 02:29:23,580
You used to remotely disable custom design freeze.

1898
02:29:24,060 --> 02:29:25,620
Oh, okay.

1899
02:29:25,780 --> 02:29:26,300
New weapon.

1900
02:29:26,700 --> 02:29:27,300
New gadget.

1901
02:29:30,920 --> 02:29:32,480
Now I can confront him.

1902
02:29:33,840 --> 02:29:35,280
Yeah, I got his SD card.

1903
02:29:35,580 --> 02:29:36,540
Yoink, mine now.

1904
02:29:41,040 --> 02:29:42,620
Yeah, it's the override chip.

1905
02:29:47,420 --> 02:29:48,880
Alright, gotta head over.

1906
02:29:49,680 --> 02:29:54,810
Did I make it?

1907
02:30:02,070 --> 02:30:03,770
Guys, I didn't make it.

1908
02:30:06,770 --> 02:30:08,610
It's a good thing, Mr. Freeze.

1909
02:30:08,950 --> 02:30:12,230
Yeah, it's made it compatible for the Batman suit.

1910
02:30:13,050 --> 02:30:15,130
Thank you for the...

1911
02:30:15,130 --> 02:30:16,510
Do you think that guy saw it?

1912
02:30:16,970 --> 02:30:18,550
I don't think you saw it, right?

1913
02:30:22,490 --> 02:30:24,690
She, in fact, did not make it.

1914
02:30:27,230 --> 02:30:27,590
Okay.

1915
02:30:36,620 --> 02:30:37,940
I pulled myself to it.

1916
02:30:38,080 --> 02:30:38,960
Okay, we pulled each other.

1917
02:30:39,660 --> 02:30:40,360
That's fine.

1918
02:30:45,780 --> 02:30:47,420
But, Balergas, thank you for the super chat.

1919
02:30:47,500 --> 02:30:48,080
Thank you, thing.

1920
02:30:48,260 --> 02:30:49,340
Thank you.

1921
02:30:49,480 --> 02:30:49,940
What?

1922
02:30:50,780 --> 02:30:51,440
That's it.

1923
02:30:52,160 --> 02:30:53,440
I'm gonna beat you up.

1924
02:30:53,580 --> 02:30:55,700
I'm gonna beat up a fucking shark today.

1925
02:30:57,920 --> 02:30:59,280
That's fucking right.

1926
02:31:01,980 --> 02:31:02,980
I could have just done it.

1927
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:03,860
that on a lot.

1928
02:31:04,080 --> 02:31:05,520
Okay, that looks so fucking goofy.

1929
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:07,380
I literally just punched a shark.

1930
02:31:12,700 --> 02:31:14,740
I don't need shark repellent.

1931
02:31:15,560 --> 02:31:18,360
I got my fist right here.

1932
02:31:21,720 --> 02:31:23,880
I'm gonna give him a goddamn beat down.

1933
02:31:25,320 --> 02:31:27,680
So how do I use this?

1934
02:31:29,440 --> 02:31:30,600
I'm too far away.

1935
02:31:31,640 --> 02:31:33,540
The override won't work this far away.

1936
02:31:33,580 --> 02:31:34,060
Oh, wait.

1937
02:31:34,140 --> 02:31:36,320
I just got Oh, sorry.

1938
02:31:36,540 --> 02:31:38,840
I got so confident after beating down that shark.

1939
02:31:38,980 --> 02:31:40,010
I thought I could beat up water

1940
02:31:43,960 --> 02:32:05,980
Jesus Oh, oh my god, I'm trying not to I need to get closer to penguin before activating the security override It's just not close enough I can use the security override to get to penguin Come in Africa.

1941
02:32:06,220 --> 02:32:09,640
If you don't see it, use the override to get past Penguin.

1942
02:32:10,380 --> 02:32:12,880
Wait, how the fuck do I get close enough?

1943
02:32:15,120 --> 02:32:17,160
We just have a conversation, bro?

1944
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:19,540

02:32:41,140 --> 02:32:45,850

Who did that?

1966
02:33:10,370 --> 02:33:12,170

Visual puzzles!

1996
02:36:04,290 --> 02:36:06,770
World's greatest detective!

That's me!

1998
02:36:15,380 --> 02:36:16,720
Guys, I don't think that tells me.

1999
02:36:18,660 --> 02:36:19,620
Oh, my God.

02:36:23,900 --> 02:36:24,140

02:36:39,720 --> 02:36:40,480
He's got me.

2006
02:36:40,540 --> 02:36:41,120
Oh, shit.

2007
02:36:45,920 --> 02:36:46,480
There you go.

2008
02:36:46,660 --> 02:36:47,040
I should have.

2009
02:36:47,060 --> 02:36:49,440
That should be everything.

2010
02:36:52,990 --> 02:36:54,710
Snap out of it, man!

2011
02:36:56,030 --> 02:36:57,570

Oh shit!

2019
02:37:28,970 --> 02:37:29,990
I forgot to struggle.

2020
02:37:30,350 --> 02:37:31,690
There was a quick time event.

2021
02:37:35,470 --> 02:37:37,790
How do I stop that?

2022
02:37:42,430 --> 02:37:42,990
Oh.

2023
02:37:42,990 --> 02:37:44,230
Oh my god, okay.

2024
02:37:52,440 --> 02:37:55,560
Oh my god, I'm trying to fucking... Please!

2025
02:37:57,160 --> 02:37:58,280
Just take it off.

2026
02:37:59,560 --> 02:38:04,080
I will brute force this!

2027
02:38:06,480 --> 02:38:08,260
There you go.

2028
02:38:08,920 --> 02:38:10,360
I have enough HP.

2029
02:38:21,900 --> 02:38:23,420
Alright, now...

2030
02:38:25,560 --> 02:38:28,820
Now I can beat the shit out of him.

2031
02:38:29,040 --> 02:38:31,040
Oh my god, Batman!

2032
02:38:33,240 --> 02:38:34,160
Oh my god!

2033
02:38:34,960 --> 02:38:37,160
The bat versus the bird.

2034
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:40,780
Bro, I literally...

2035
02:38:40,780 --> 02:38:43,040
Did I just like fucking...

2036
02:38:43,040 --> 02:38:44,240
Jesus Christ!

2037
02:38:45,220 --> 02:38:46,240
I just ripped his heart.

2038
02:38:46,360 --> 02:38:47,940
I just beat the shit out of his heart.

2039
02:38:50,680 --> 02:38:51,640
That's fine.

2040
02:38:53,220 --> 02:38:56,280
You have nothing after I get close to you.

2041
02:38:57,660 --> 02:38:59,320
Get out of here, little man.

2042
02:39:00,940 --> 02:39:02,980
You wish you were Danny the Vito.

2043
02:39:06,280 --> 02:39:08,520
Where is Cobble Pot?

2044
02:39:10,440 --> 02:39:12,120
Oh, wait, it's a ninja lady.

2045
02:39:12,520 --> 02:39:14,220
Oh, look who it is.

2046
02:39:15,220 --> 02:39:16,060
Don't worry.

2047
02:39:16,480 --> 02:39:17,680
Next Monday, he'll be back.

2048
02:39:22,560 --> 02:39:22,660
Enough.

2049
02:39:23,380 --> 02:39:24,200
Of course.

2050
02:39:27,300 --> 02:39:28,180
Oh.

2051
02:39:28,400 --> 02:39:32,920
You will regret what you did, Mr. Cobblepot.

2052
02:39:41,960 --> 02:39:43,060
Interior on exhibit.

2053
02:39:43,920 --> 02:39:44,780
The cure, Freeze.

2054
02:39:47,320 --> 02:39:48,960
There isn't one.

2055
02:39:49,660 --> 02:39:49,880
What?

2056
02:39:49,880 --> 02:39:52,760
I was thinking of a super chat thingy, thank you.

2057
02:39:52,880 --> 02:39:55,720
Creating an antidote to the disease that afflicts the clown was easy.

2058
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,620
Unfortunately, the cure degrades too quickly.

2059
02:40:00,240 --> 02:40:04,360
It needs a restorative element, some kind of reforming enzyme.

2060
02:40:05,020 --> 02:40:08,380
Without it, it breaks down before it can help its host.

2061
02:40:08,700 --> 02:40:10,160
I've seen this before.

2062
02:40:10,560 --> 02:40:13,240
Finding a suitable enzyme is not the only problem.

2063
02:40:13,920 --> 02:40:17,260
It needs to be adapted, bonded to human DNA.

2064
02:40:18,220 --> 02:40:19,500
That will take decades.

2065
02:40:20,180 --> 02:40:52,760
time it appears you do not have what if I told you I know a man who's been exposed to that enzyme for centuries what what man yeah his name is Raish Algul bring him to me all I need is a sample of his blood it is your only hope Raish Algul is dead then you and the clown wait is that do wait is that his starter i need someone to tell me where the body is then i can go wake him up

2066
02:41:02,360 --> 02:41:22,420
or it's just like a minion you are a fool batman you've let your own yeah like one of his followers no victor if rachel ghoul is in arkham city i now have a trail right to him i thought he was dead Oh,

2067
02:41:27,560 --> 02:41:29,120
she, I lied.

2068
02:41:33,220 --> 02:42:21,660
Over a century ago, murderer Cyrus Gold Celtics caved justice by hiding Forced doom, the now mortal To end the cycle of death and rebirth Rout of his memories, he adapted The name, born on a Monday Christian on Tuesday Married on Wednesday, took ill on Thursday Grew worse on Friday on saturday buried on sunday this is the end of solomon grundy all right i'll meet him again next monday i guess yeah new gadget i save everyone oh yeah everyone's saved wait what oh i just scan it whoops i thought i was just supposed to i thought already like did everything needed

2069
02:42:25,980 --> 02:42:27,200
Okay, scan time.

2070
02:42:34,560 --> 02:42:35,700
Oracle, change of plan.

2071
02:42:36,040 --> 02:42:37,600
I'm going after the League of Assassins.

2072
02:42:38,040 --> 02:42:38,300
Why?

2073
02:42:38,800 --> 02:42:41,730
What have been it?

2074
02:42:42,370 --> 02:42:44,690
Is this about Rage or his daughter?

2075
02:42:45,870 --> 02:42:48,710
Penguin had one of the League's assassins imprisoned in the museum.

2076
02:42:49,310 --> 02:42:50,950
Is this before or after Damien?

2077
02:42:51,050 --> 02:42:52,710
She's a member of Talia's elite guard.

2078
02:42:52,930 --> 02:42:53,510
I knew it.

2079
02:42:53,950 --> 02:42:57,970
What is it about that woman that makes her instantly the most important person in your world?

2080
02:42:58,870 --> 02:42:59,830
Talia is not the gold guard.

2081
02:42:59,830 --> 02:43:02,310
Did this game come up before or after Damien was...

2082
02:43:02,570 --> 02:43:03,550
Uh, before?

2083
02:43:03,950 --> 02:43:05,530
Okay, so Damien wouldn't exist yet.

2084
02:43:06,990 --> 02:43:15,110
Yeah, I was gonna say, is Damien existed yet?

2085
02:43:16,870 --> 02:43:18,470
Oh my god, that's just all his blood.

2086
02:43:20,950 --> 02:43:22,110
Okay, let's upgrade.

2087
02:43:22,630 --> 02:43:23,510
Heek signature.

2088
02:43:23,750 --> 02:43:24,230
What's that?

2089
02:43:26,750 --> 02:43:28,190
Nah, we don't need that.

2090
02:43:29,350 --> 02:43:31,110
Is there anything else that's a good upgrade?

2091
02:43:33,670 --> 02:43:34,230
Nah.

2092
02:43:39,710 --> 02:43:42,070
I feel like maybe more armor?

2093
02:43:42,970 --> 02:43:43,750
I'll do more armor.

2094
02:43:49,040 --> 02:43:50,040
I gotta go this way.

2095
02:43:52,700 --> 02:43:53,740
Talia, cool.

2096
02:43:56,760 --> 02:43:59,800
I don't even know what she looks like in my memory bank.

2097
02:44:03,800 --> 02:44:04,580
Where is he?

2098
02:44:11,420 --> 02:44:12,620
Oh yeah, I don't.

2099
02:44:12,840 --> 02:44:14,620
I don't remember what they look like.

2100
02:44:20,430 --> 02:44:33,590
I have early onset dementia apparently for Batman yeah I

2101
02:44:38,420 --> 02:44:57,080
did too heavy slowed me down let me know when it's here all right gotta go this way the boss is vanished what where'd

2102
02:45:01,900 --> 02:45:03,860
Okay, this lady should die from blood loss.

2103
02:45:04,100 --> 02:45:05,680
Like, not even die, just passed out.

2104
02:45:05,840 --> 02:45:07,000
Like, that is so much blood.

2105
02:45:10,300 --> 02:45:12,860
That is way too much blood, girl.

2106
02:45:13,980 --> 02:45:17,280
How do you not have passed out from blood loss?

2107
02:45:25,170 --> 02:45:26,630
Wait, the trail went cold.

2108
02:45:26,770 --> 02:45:27,690
Where the fuck is she?

2109
02:45:27,770 --> 02:45:28,590
Oh, it's over here.

2110
02:45:32,030 --> 02:45:33,050
Like, the fact that...

2111
02:45:33,050 --> 02:45:34,250
Bro, look...

2112
02:45:36,150 --> 02:45:38,630
That is a lot of blood.

2113
02:45:39,630 --> 02:45:41,350
Okay, let's get rid of these guys first.

2114
02:45:43,270 --> 02:45:48,470
Bro, I'm trying to follow my blood trail and you're...

2115
02:45:48,470 --> 02:45:51,090
You're messing it up for me.

2116
02:45:53,470 --> 02:45:54,310
Like, here?

2117
02:45:54,770 --> 02:45:55,490
Wait, it stopped.

2118
02:45:55,670 --> 02:45:56,870
Okay, she jumped down.

2119
02:45:57,810 --> 02:45:58,430
Now where?

2120
02:45:59,550 --> 02:46:00,690
Where'd she go after?

2121
02:46:02,490 --> 02:46:03,590
This way.

2122
02:46:04,670 --> 02:46:11,270
she went up oh my god little cat and mouse shit here some parkour stuff that she's doing

2123
02:46:17,380 --> 02:46:48,540
and down here and then she climbed up a lamppost okay what does she do after she climbed up this fucking lamppost wait what did she do after here come on no it's up here wait what does she do afterwards okay and then what okay she went this way oh

2124
02:46:52,500 --> 02:47:11,200
holy shit why did she have to make this so difficult wait where after oh this way the blood trail has run out the only way I'm gonna find that assassin is to locate more evidence scan assassins banish Oh, here it is.

2125
02:47:13,220 --> 02:47:16,940
What, did she, like, catarize her wounds or something?

2126
02:47:20,200 --> 02:47:21,300
Who said that?

2127
02:47:21,360 --> 02:47:21,900
Oh, there she is.

2128
02:47:21,920 --> 02:47:24,480
The only way to find Rage is to get a tracker on that ninja.

2129
02:47:24,640 --> 02:47:26,320
I'll need to get in close.

2130
02:47:28,480 --> 02:47:29,360
Come here after you.

2131
02:47:29,560 --> 02:47:30,580
Come here to get you.

2132
02:47:31,300 --> 02:47:32,440
Come here to get you.

2133
02:47:37,100 --> 02:47:37,500
Oops.

2134
02:47:37,840 --> 02:47:38,720
Wait, give me a sec.

2135
02:47:39,320 --> 02:47:40,460
Can you wait a little bit?

2136
02:47:42,140 --> 02:47:43,000
Did I lose her trail?

2137
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:45,080
Oh my gosh, she's over there.

2138
02:47:48,120 --> 02:47:49,320
Oh my god, fucked up.

2139
02:47:49,880 --> 02:47:51,200
Oh my gosh, she's so fast.

2140
02:47:58,390 --> 02:48:00,010
Wait, I think I lost her.

2141
02:48:01,390 --> 02:48:06,230
Oh wait, it's so good that she waited for me because she's like suffering from blood loss.

2142
02:48:08,590 --> 02:48:10,130
That's very convenient.

2143
02:48:13,270 --> 02:48:14,690
Thank god she's limping.

2144
02:48:18,990 --> 02:48:19,330
Whoa!

2145
02:48:20,890 --> 02:48:24,110
She will continue to live because the great racial rule allows it.

2146
02:48:24,110 --> 02:48:24,870
Wait, triplets?

2147
02:48:28,730 --> 02:48:29,410
Robin!

2148
02:48:30,630 --> 02:48:32,330
I can take her.

2149
02:48:33,050 --> 02:48:33,770
Stand down.

2150
02:48:33,950 --> 02:48:34,230
Which one?

2151
02:48:34,390 --> 02:48:35,510
Which Robin is this?

2152
02:48:36,210 --> 02:48:36,550
Dick?

2153
02:48:36,750 --> 02:48:37,210
Jason?

2154
02:48:38,030 --> 02:48:39,410
Or the other one?

2155
02:48:39,670 --> 02:48:41,010
Do not follow us.

2156
02:48:43,230 --> 02:48:43,670
Tim!

2157
02:48:43,950 --> 02:48:45,350
Oh shit, sorry, Tim.

2158
02:48:47,150 --> 02:48:48,310
You need your help.

2159
02:48:48,730 --> 02:48:48,750
Really?

2160
02:48:49,710 --> 02:48:51,230
That's not what it looked like from where I was standing.

2161
02:48:51,230 --> 02:48:51,850
Took me three tries.

2162
02:48:51,870 --> 02:48:52,930
I got it under control.

2163
02:48:53,410 --> 02:48:54,810
I forgot about Tim.

2164
02:48:55,330 --> 02:48:57,090
Sorry, he's the most boring one.

2165
02:48:58,250 --> 02:48:59,370
Nobody remembers Tim.

2166
02:48:59,430 --> 02:49:01,010
He's like the middle child.

2167
02:49:01,350 --> 02:49:02,590
The middle Robin.

2168
02:49:03,910 --> 02:49:07,050
Anyone with this blood in them will be dead within 24 hours.

2169
02:49:07,410 --> 02:49:08,330
Whose blood is it?

2170
02:49:09,250 --> 02:49:09,450
Oh.

2171
02:49:10,350 --> 02:49:10,930
It's yours.

2172
02:49:11,130 --> 02:49:11,650
Oh my god.

2173
02:49:11,910 --> 02:49:13,170
Finally a Robin.

2174
02:49:13,530 --> 02:49:14,970
I'll get into the hospitals and come back.

2175
02:49:15,050 --> 02:49:15,930
You need my help here.

2176
02:49:16,110 --> 02:49:17,010
I can handle it.

2177
02:49:17,150 --> 02:49:32,370
you're needed in gotham what has tim even done much worse i don't remember tim's backstory knows who you are what happens if he tells everyone oh yeah people are gonna reveal him trust me i'll find a way

2179
02:49:53,120 --> 02:49:54,580
I'm like, what did Tim do?

2180
02:49:55,060 --> 02:49:58,760
Allows rapid movement between two or is on can be redeployed.

2181
02:49:58,860 --> 02:50:02,900
How many gadgets do I have while riding the change direction?

2182
02:50:09,690 --> 02:50:10,230
Yeah.

2183
02:50:11,190 --> 02:50:12,770
But Jason has trauma.

2184
02:50:12,890 --> 02:50:13,990
Well, all of them have trauma.

2185
02:50:17,770 --> 02:50:20,450
Look, Jason's been through a rough time, okay?

2186
02:50:21,630 --> 02:50:48,530
he was the middle child until he he got he got crowbarred then we just then we had to be nice to him after that also he's a robin that shoots a gun that's already pretty badass he's literally the only robin that uses a gun everyone has trauma he's not he's coming back no one knows how but he will

2187
02:50:53,690 --> 02:50:56,950
side wait where am i going

2188
02:51:05,120 --> 02:51:26,120
wait how much okay wait the biggest thing tim has done is he's a robin who introduced pants to the robin brand he also figured out who batman was that's the whole thing just some guy they give us super chat thank you thank you Okay, so how do I do this?

2189
02:51:30,420 --> 02:51:34,840
Yeah, but everyone eventually figure out who Bruce Batman is.

2190
02:51:35,340 --> 02:51:36,580
He ain't special.

2191
02:51:37,320 --> 02:51:39,000
We all figured it out.

2192
02:51:43,530 --> 02:51:47,990
But he- I mean, good for him for letting the Robins have pants.

2193
02:51:49,050 --> 02:51:49,910
Alright, what?

2194
02:51:57,860 --> 02:51:59,800
Like, he gave me this tool.

2195
02:52:05,690 --> 02:52:06,290
What?

2196
02:52:07,810 --> 02:52:09,490
Bro, that's my girlfriend.

2197
02:52:09,630 --> 02:52:10,630
Who said that?

2198
02:52:11,870 --> 02:52:13,690
Bro, who the fuck said that?

2199
02:52:13,870 --> 02:52:15,430
That's my girlfriend over there.

2200
02:52:23,640 --> 02:52:25,500
I don't know what to do with this.

2201
02:52:27,560 --> 02:52:29,600
They're talking about my girl again.

2202
02:52:29,780 --> 02:52:31,140
The prison is better than this.

2203
02:52:33,600 --> 02:52:37,640
Arkham City is an equal opportunities penal facility.

2204
02:52:38,240 --> 02:52:38,920
Oh, there it is.

2205
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:42,080

And then I got super aids.

2210
02:53:45,210 --> 02:53:47,130
He's so obsessed, man.

2211
02:53:58,500 --> 02:53:59,260

2212
02:53:59,260 --> 02:53:59,940
Oh, it's this way.

2213
02:54:03,480 --> 02:54:05,320
Is this where the tracker's taking me?

2214
02:54:11,930 --> 02:54:13,990
I gotta get him out of here first.

2215
02:54:16,970 --> 02:54:22,240
Can I say thank you for the super chat?

2216
02:54:22,300 --> 02:54:23,340
Thank you, thank you.

2217
02:54:23,560 --> 02:54:24,880
I feel bad for Tim.

2218
02:54:24,980 --> 02:54:25,660
Tim went on...

2219
02:54:26,120 --> 02:54:27,760
Dick went on to become Nightwing.

2220
02:54:27,880 --> 02:54:29,740
Jason went on to become Red Hood.

2221
02:54:30,020 --> 02:54:33,260
Tim went on to become Red Robin.

2222
02:54:34,020 --> 02:54:34,700
To be fair.

2223
02:54:37,580 --> 02:54:41,100
Tim really needs to move on from the whole Robin brand.

2224
02:54:41,280 --> 02:54:43,020
This is why nobody remembers him.

2225
02:54:44,720 --> 02:54:46,940
Like Damien's the son of Batman.

2226
02:54:48,680 --> 02:54:51,000
Dick is the first Robin.

2227
02:54:52,520 --> 02:54:54,640
Jason used to be the middle child.

2228
02:54:54,940 --> 02:54:56,040
And then, like, you know.

2229
02:54:56,120 --> 02:54:59,480
He died, so like we all feel bad for him.

2230
02:55:01,240 --> 02:55:02,320
And then there's Tim.

2231
02:55:13,110 --> 02:55:14,080
Alright, it's this way.

2232
02:55:15,730 --> 02:55:18,170
See, is that Assassin, like, moving?

2233
02:55:19,750 --> 02:55:21,390
Oh my god, she is!

2234
02:55:22,250 --> 02:55:26,190
I didn't even realize she's been moving this entire time.

2235
02:55:37,650 --> 02:55:38,890
I can't even... What?

2236
02:55:40,450 --> 02:55:41,670
Where is she?

2237
02:55:42,290 --> 02:55:43,710
She's right below me.

2238
02:55:43,730 --> 02:55:47,170
That does not make sense What oh my god.

2239
02:55:47,650 --> 02:55:48,130
Oh my okay.

2240
02:55:48,150 --> 02:55:48,970
It's fine.

2241
02:55:49,830 --> 02:55:56,730
Okay, I'm gonna use this What the fuck wait what oh shit?

2242
02:55:57,090 --> 02:56:01,450
Okay, I did not know I could do that that was actually a mis-input That's crazy.

2243
02:56:02,950 --> 02:56:15,210
Oh fuck Okay, I realized that they all had guns Okay, that was pretty cool I sort of fucked up though after that Because I got a little too greedy.

2244
02:56:15,810 --> 02:56:18,350
I got a little too greedy there.

2245
02:56:19,110 --> 02:56:20,450
Oh my god, let's do this again.

2246
02:56:21,370 --> 02:56:22,300
Where the fuck are they?

2247
02:56:26,500 --> 02:56:29,280
So what's up with Batman going in the museum?

2248
02:56:30,900 --> 02:56:32,860
Like he's in, she's in the tunnel.

2249
02:56:36,280 --> 02:56:38,340
Wait, was that one of the hardest challenges?

2250
02:56:38,440 --> 02:56:39,920
Like, that's hard to do?

2251
02:56:44,580 --> 02:56:46,260
But how do I get in the tunnel?

2252
02:56:52,140 --> 02:56:52,660
Wait,

2253
02:57:06,870 --> 02:57:07,830
how do I get in there?

2254
02:57:10,550 --> 02:57:12,230
Yeah, but where are the goons?

2255
02:57:14,430 --> 02:57:15,750
Is it here?

2256
02:57:16,750 --> 02:57:17,270
Oh,

2257
02:57:22,900 --> 02:57:23,560
there's the hole.

2258
02:57:23,840 --> 02:57:24,660
Okay, there it is.

2259
02:57:27,320 --> 02:57:28,960
I forgot where the hole was.

2260
02:57:35,180 --> 02:57:36,080
Oh, fuck!

2261
02:57:38,760 --> 02:57:39,520
That's right.

2262
02:57:39,880 --> 02:57:40,460
Can't get...

2263
02:57:40,460 --> 02:57:41,240
Whoa, don't!

2264
02:57:41,460 --> 02:57:42,520
Get in the hole, Batman!

2265
02:57:43,680 --> 02:57:44,660
Can't get me.

2266
02:57:44,800 --> 02:57:45,940
I'm in the hole now.

2267
02:57:46,920 --> 02:57:47,080
Alright.

2268
02:57:47,500 --> 02:57:48,420
We did it.

2269
02:57:48,520 --> 02:57:50,200
Gotham's a maze of old steel and ironwork.

2270
02:57:50,520 --> 02:57:50,520
What?

2271
02:57:50,740 --> 02:57:51,060
What the fuck?

2272
02:57:51,060 --> 02:57:51,920
My signal may get weak.

2273
02:57:52,200 --> 02:57:53,340
Try and stay locked on.

2274
02:57:53,600 --> 02:57:55,440
Rerouting additional satellite coverage now.

2275
02:57:56,040 --> 02:57:56,600
Good luck, Bruce.

2276
02:57:56,620 --> 02:57:58,800
Okay, the swamp water is bad water.

2277
02:58:03,720 --> 02:58:04,500
This way?

2278
02:58:09,800 --> 02:58:12,420
Oh my god, when you said it was a maze...

2279
02:58:12,440 --> 02:58:14,760
I didn't realize it was a maze maze.

2280
02:58:17,140 --> 02:58:17,940
Hello guys.

2281
02:58:19,240 --> 02:58:19,980
Okay, thank god.

2282
02:58:20,360 --> 02:58:23,180
You guys didn't have- you're not the- you're not the gun goons.

2283
02:58:23,800 --> 02:58:24,960
That's all that matters.

2284
02:58:27,560 --> 02:58:28,360
Jesus Christ.

2285
02:58:30,160 --> 02:58:31,720
Bro, I can't even dodge it.

2286
02:58:37,010 --> 02:58:38,210
Bro, please, please!

2287
02:58:38,890 --> 02:58:39,450
That's it!

2288
02:58:40,450 --> 02:58:41,250
It's time!

2289
02:58:43,470 --> 02:58:45,330
Oh my god, he's- oh, whoops.

2290
02:58:45,530 --> 02:58:46,170
I'll take those.

2291
02:58:46,770 --> 02:58:47,030
Re-kill.

2292
02:58:52,410 --> 02:58:53,380
There we go.

2293
02:58:55,330 --> 02:58:56,410
Finish her!

2294
02:59:00,010 --> 02:59:00,550
Jesus.

2295
02:59:01,450 --> 02:59:02,730
I sent one to the pit, too.

2296
02:59:02,770 --> 02:59:04,470
Joker's got his crew moving through the sewers.

2297
02:59:04,930 --> 02:59:06,430
Hunting down what's left of Penguin's thugs.

2298
02:59:06,710 --> 02:59:09,670
Look, it's him not being able to swim.

2299
02:59:09,870 --> 02:59:10,950
It's not my fault.

2300
02:59:11,510 --> 02:59:13,150
I didn't intentionally kill him.

2301
02:59:13,850 --> 02:59:15,910
Him drowning is just an accident.

2302
02:59:19,250 --> 02:59:20,950
Wait, what is it?

2303
02:59:22,690 --> 02:59:23,350
Uh-oh.

2304
02:59:24,950 --> 02:59:28,150
I see the Joker teeth, but like, do I get anything out of that?

2305
02:59:29,550 --> 02:59:31,910
I don't even know if I got anything out of it.

2306
02:59:43,220 --> 02:59:43,660
Weeeee!

2307
02:59:44,740 --> 02:59:46,340
Oh shit, it's supposed to be here.

2308
02:59:47,340 --> 02:59:48,600
How do I get over there?

2309
02:59:52,680 --> 02:59:53,180
This way?

2310
02:59:55,580 --> 02:59:56,020
No?

2311
03:00:03,090 --> 03:00:06,870
maybe here there you

2312
03:00:10,830 --> 03:00:16,370
go okay this way okay

2313
03:00:22,250 --> 03:00:42,750

2314
03:00:44,650 --> 03:00:45,070
Okay.

2315
03:00:46,730 --> 03:00:49,010
I just gotta figure out how to get down there.

2316
03:00:56,130 --> 03:00:57,590
Oh, there it is.

2317
03:00:57,810 --> 03:00:58,490
Okay, there's explosive.

2318
03:00:58,770 --> 03:00:59,750
Oh, okay, never mind.

2319
03:01:00,650 --> 03:01:02,090
I make my own exit.

2320
03:01:02,910 --> 03:01:03,830
That's right.

2321
03:01:07,410 --> 03:01:09,130
I love the explosive.

2322
03:01:09,410 --> 03:01:10,290
Just so dumb.

2323
03:01:11,290 --> 03:01:11,890
Oh, shit!

2324
03:01:13,790 --> 03:01:14,630
That's right.

2325
03:01:14,930 --> 03:01:15,630
You ain't setting me up.

2326
03:01:15,650 --> 03:01:43,270
no alarm here wait what's that oh my god get over here get your ass out of that gun get over here he ain't fucking opening a gun no gun for you yeah oh no he He got the gun.

2327
03:01:43,610 --> 03:01:44,430
He got the gun.

2328
03:01:44,770 --> 03:01:46,110
But I got my Batarang.

2329
03:01:51,070 --> 03:01:52,110
It's fine.

2330
03:01:58,850 --> 03:01:59,890
Finish it.

2331
03:02:02,730 --> 03:02:06,190
I love that the Batarang was the one that kills him.

2332
03:02:09,950 --> 03:02:16,030
I feel like I'm not supposed to... I feel like this is not where Raza Ghoul's assassin is.

2333
03:02:16,510 --> 03:02:17,410
I don't know.

2334
03:02:20,470 --> 03:02:23,910
I feel like being further and further away from the assassin.

2335
03:02:24,930 --> 03:02:25,710
Oh, thank God.

2336
03:02:25,850 --> 03:02:27,310
I'm heading the right way.

2337
03:02:28,190 --> 03:02:28,850
Thank God.

2338
03:02:30,490 --> 03:02:31,850
I was starting to doubt it.

2339
03:02:32,530 --> 03:02:34,910
I felt like I was on, like, some random side quest.

2340
03:02:38,290 --> 03:02:38,650
Oops.

2341
03:02:47,330 --> 03:02:47,770
Yeah.

2342
03:02:48,150 --> 03:02:49,390
Oh, that's not it.

2343
03:02:49,830 --> 03:02:50,370
There you go.

2344
03:02:56,560 --> 03:02:57,400
Go up.

2345
03:03:02,380 --> 03:03:03,580
Did he just give me XP?

2346
03:03:04,160 --> 03:03:04,740
Oh, it does.

2347
03:03:13,590 --> 03:03:15,370
Oh, am I drunk?

2348
03:03:15,550 --> 03:03:16,850
What the fuck is going on?

2349
03:03:17,910 --> 03:03:18,750
Oh, it's my blood.

2350
03:03:21,550 --> 03:03:23,410
That's my super aides.

2351
03:03:23,570 --> 03:03:25,110
Just give me a minute.

2352
03:03:27,990 --> 03:03:28,890
I'll be all right.

2353
03:03:29,370 --> 03:03:30,430
No, you won't.

2354
03:03:30,990 --> 03:03:31,030
Hurry.

2355
03:03:31,490 --> 03:03:32,810
You're running out of time.

2356
03:03:34,590 --> 03:03:35,670
Oh, no.

2357
03:03:36,590 --> 03:03:38,630
It's spreading to my brains.

2358
03:03:39,630 --> 03:03:40,950
Guns, explosives.

2359
03:03:40,970 --> 03:04:11,390
thermal trackers what the fuck is going on with my just music what are you saying joke is my man you know that been in his crew for years so stop asking questions you know they don't like questions okay sorry just seems weird that's all guys I I don't know if this is considered stealth,

2360
03:04:11,530 --> 03:04:12,850
but we'll find out.

2361
03:04:16,090 --> 03:04:18,030
Do you think they know that I was there?

2362
03:04:18,830 --> 03:04:20,690
Do you think I got away with it?

2363
03:04:23,810 --> 03:04:24,530
Okay, nice.

2364
03:04:30,030 --> 03:04:31,730
Okay, that's fine.

2365
03:04:32,670 --> 03:04:33,770
I got away with it.

2366
03:04:34,510 --> 03:04:35,150
I don't know how.

2367
03:04:36,610 --> 03:04:38,850
I don't know how, but I think I'll get away with it.

2368
03:04:43,840 --> 03:04:44,720
Jesus Christ.

2369
03:04:45,700 --> 03:04:47,140
What are you gonna do, man?

2370
03:04:49,100 --> 03:04:51,080
There are so many people!

2371
03:04:54,720 --> 03:04:55,320
Okay, it's fine.

2372
03:04:55,900 --> 03:04:57,080
Slam dunk!

2373
03:05:02,740 --> 03:05:03,780
Okay, nice.

2374
03:05:05,080 --> 03:05:05,840
Got your leg!

2375
03:05:08,600 --> 03:05:09,720
I wish...

2376
03:05:09,720 --> 03:05:12,080
I wish the explosives was lethal.

2377
03:05:14,080 --> 03:05:15,660
But at least he can give me a quick stun.

2378
03:05:17,960 --> 03:05:18,900
There you go.

2379
03:05:19,200 --> 03:05:20,800
I countered with my fist.

2380
03:05:21,540 --> 03:05:22,420
That counts, right?

2381
03:05:22,900 --> 03:05:26,440
It looks like Joker is sending his crew down to steal weapons off the Tiger Guards.

2382
03:05:26,660 --> 03:05:27,420
That's not good.

2383
03:05:27,900 --> 03:05:30,080
Those guys are armed with the latest military weapons.

2384
03:05:30,520 --> 03:05:34,440
If Joker gets his hands on that stuff, well, you know.

2385
03:05:34,840 --> 03:05:35,460
He won't.

2386
03:05:35,840 --> 03:05:36,820
I won't let him.

2387
03:05:37,820 --> 03:05:38,840
I did it, guys.

2388
03:05:38,920 --> 03:05:40,920
I countered with my fist.

2389
03:05:42,080 --> 03:05:43,720
That's all, that's the same thing.

2390
03:05:47,360 --> 03:05:48,780
This is a great offense.

2391
03:05:49,480 --> 03:05:51,520
Look what we got here.

2392
03:05:51,960 --> 03:05:52,780
What's up, Doc?

2393
03:05:53,520 --> 03:05:54,760
Please don't hurt me.

2394
03:05:55,100 --> 03:05:56,560
Oh, we ain't gonna hurt you, sweet.

2395
03:05:57,000 --> 03:05:58,540
Not a pretty little thing like you.

2396
03:05:59,120 --> 03:05:59,600
Please.

2397
03:06:00,120 --> 03:06:01,000
I'm an intern.

2398
03:06:01,560 --> 03:06:02,720
I don't know what's going on here.

2399
03:06:02,740 --> 03:06:03,760
Bro, she's just an intern.

2400
03:06:04,920 --> 03:06:06,340
She's here for exposure.

2401
03:06:07,040 --> 03:06:09,420
Get the rest of the guns out and stack them up over there.

2402
03:06:09,660 --> 03:06:10,760
We're on a schedule here.

2403
03:06:11,400 --> 03:06:12,420
What are these things?

2404
03:06:13,780 --> 03:06:16,060
Military grade interference generators.

2405
03:06:16,660 --> 03:06:17,160
Best money.

2406
03:06:21,720 --> 03:06:24,200
Am I on a sad quest?

2407
03:06:30,940 --> 03:06:33,020
I don't think there's no...

2408
03:06:33,020 --> 03:06:34,660
Is Raul Ghul even here?

2409
03:06:36,060 --> 03:06:37,740
Okay, no, that's main quest.

2410
03:06:37,840 --> 03:06:38,920
I was gonna say it.

2411
03:06:38,920 --> 03:06:41,560
Let's just have to do with Raul Ghul and the assassins.

2412
03:06:41,840 --> 03:06:42,620
Not nice people.

2413
03:06:44,200 --> 03:06:44,880
Oh, God.

2414
03:06:45,180 --> 03:06:45,580
Please.

2415
03:06:45,920 --> 03:06:46,980
I can't fix him.

2416
03:06:47,360 --> 03:06:48,360
Please let me go.

2417
03:06:49,160 --> 03:06:49,740
Sorry, Doc.

2418
03:06:49,740 --> 03:06:51,240
Okay, that's where I'm supposed to be.

2419
03:06:51,300 --> 03:06:51,780
I got...

2420
03:06:51,800 --> 03:07:24,460
confused don't try to run I'd hate to have to punish you you got such a pretty face yeah you don't want a bullet going through it me my favorite the hammer more personal now you can feel every blow understand the complexity of the human body as it's deconstructed into a primordial sludge that's deep man I had you all wrong I told you just like hitting people with hammers who told you Are you just really like hammers,

2421
03:07:24,640 --> 03:07:24,680
bro?

2422
03:07:27,020 --> 03:07:29,300
Is this situation requiring savoring lives?

2423
03:07:29,680 --> 03:07:30,320
Is this...

2424
03:07:30,320 --> 03:07:32,200
Okay, but she didn't have a name.

2425
03:07:32,520 --> 03:07:34,420
Okay, so she clearly isn't that important.

2426
03:07:35,260 --> 03:07:36,440
She's just a doctor.

2427
03:07:42,700 --> 03:07:45,800
How is I supposed to know she was an important doctor?

2428
03:07:49,860 --> 03:07:51,380
Guys, I don't think I hid.

2429
03:07:55,920 --> 03:07:56,680
It's fine.

2430
03:07:56,840 --> 03:07:57,400
They don't know.

2431
03:08:02,540 --> 03:08:03,980
That's right.

2432
03:08:04,900 --> 03:08:05,960
Couldn't see me.

2433
03:08:06,520 --> 03:08:07,540
Random bullshit.

2434
03:08:07,920 --> 03:08:08,580
Let's go.

2435
03:08:12,940 --> 03:08:14,500
It always works.

2436
03:08:20,660 --> 03:08:22,840
I told you.

2437
03:08:23,700 --> 03:08:25,160
It always works.

2438
03:08:28,640 --> 03:08:29,640
Pocket sand.

2439
03:08:30,220 --> 03:08:31,420
Can you hear me?

2440
03:08:31,420 --> 03:08:32,160
Thank God it's you!

2441
03:08:32,520 --> 03:08:33,400
Where are my guns?

2442
03:08:33,940 --> 03:08:34,520
Help me!

2443
03:08:35,560 --> 03:08:37,880
They are very important in my planter.

2444
03:08:38,580 --> 03:08:38,840
Who?

2445
03:08:39,700 --> 03:08:41,260
Are you still down there, Bats?

2446
03:08:41,700 --> 03:08:42,100
It's me!

2447
03:08:42,720 --> 03:08:45,760
Did you keep getting away with this?

2448
03:08:47,380 --> 03:08:48,160
That's right.

2449
03:08:48,460 --> 03:08:49,860
Batter ran over guns.

2450
03:08:51,200 --> 03:08:52,800
Don't worry, I got you, girl.

2451
03:08:55,040 --> 03:08:56,420
That's my new girlfriend.

2452
03:08:58,440 --> 03:08:59,520
Where am I?

2453
03:09:00,840 --> 03:09:31,440
thank you what are you doing in arkham city i'm in arkham city what the hell am i doing here i was grabbed outside the hospital i interned at god this is an intern i like how i like your trust just has the word intern on it joker looks like you were unlucky he's dying right it seems that way how do you know not to feel bad about that what now i mean he did murder thousands of people I'll be back.

2454
03:09:31,720 --> 03:09:33,500
Wait, why am I... Okay, I have to save.

2455
03:09:33,640 --> 03:09:34,560
Oh, yeah, I was gonna say why am I...

2456
03:09:34,560 --> 03:09:37,360
Oh, yeah, because he's dying from the same disease as I am.

2457
03:09:37,360 --> 03:09:38,980
Joker's not stealing the weapons from Strange.

2458
03:09:40,100 --> 03:09:42,080
Strange is giving Joker the weapons.

2459
03:09:42,380 --> 03:09:43,060
Oh, are you sure?

2460
03:09:43,700 --> 03:09:44,380
Of course we are.

2461
03:09:44,900 --> 03:09:45,780
Why would he do that?

2462
03:09:46,700 --> 03:09:49,280
Maybe he's trying to control who runs the streets.

2463
03:09:50,000 --> 03:09:51,340
I'm going to look into it.

2464
03:09:51,420 --> 03:09:54,040
Okay, but shouldn't you find Rage first?

2465
03:09:54,440 --> 03:09:55,600
I'm doing that now.

2466
03:09:56,120 --> 03:09:57,040
Don't worry, Barbara.

2467
03:10:00,220 --> 03:10:01,200
All right.

2468
03:10:02,180 --> 03:10:04,240
Okay, now back to my regular mission.

2469
03:10:06,140 --> 03:10:08,000
It's this way.

2470
03:10:09,200 --> 03:10:12,560
I think it's this way?

2471
03:10:13,640 --> 03:10:16,040
Back to what I was originally supposed to be doing.

2472
03:10:17,540 --> 03:10:19,300
Welcome to Wonder City.

2473
03:10:20,520 --> 03:10:23,180
Oh no, I'm tripping out, dude.

2474
03:10:24,320 --> 03:10:25,340
Oh no.

2475
03:10:30,220 --> 03:10:31,140
God, that's not good.

2476
03:10:31,280 --> 03:10:32,040
I don't think...

2477
03:10:32,040 --> 03:10:33,260
I don't think that's water.

2478
03:10:34,280 --> 03:10:36,660
Do you think that's good blood or bad blood?

2479
03:10:38,780 --> 03:10:47,540
Guys, I think... I think I'm having a bad trip.

2480
03:10:47,560 --> 03:10:50,700
This man's mistakes nail the coffin shut.

2481
03:10:51,820 --> 03:10:54,300
But this doesn't have to be your future.

2482
03:10:55,320 --> 03:10:55,640
There!

2483
03:10:56,500 --> 03:10:57,040
Everywhere!

2484
03:10:58,760 --> 03:10:59,360
What?

2485
03:10:59,600 --> 03:11:00,940
Oh, this is assassins.

2486
03:11:02,260 --> 03:11:06,100
Behind this wall is mankind's chance for survival.

2487
03:11:06,640 --> 03:11:10,180
A glimpse of the future based on an amazing discovery.

2488
03:11:10,540 --> 03:11:12,240
You guys think that was ketchup, guys?

2489
03:11:13,520 --> 03:11:15,600
When did I eat ketchup?

2490
03:11:16,460 --> 03:11:20,180
Peep out or die.

2491
03:11:20,420 --> 03:11:20,900
Intrigued.

2492
03:11:21,780 --> 03:11:23,160
Then step closer.

2493
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:26,900
Witness the future of Gotham City.

2494
03:11:28,620 --> 03:11:30,140
Okay, I think...

2495
03:11:32,760 --> 03:11:34,300
On their city.

2496
03:11:35,240 --> 03:11:35,380
Oh.

2497
03:11:39,750 --> 03:11:40,410
You know what?

2498
03:11:40,590 --> 03:11:41,590
Fuck this.

2499
03:11:43,410 --> 03:11:46,210
Wait, they can dodge the batterang?

2500
03:11:52,480 --> 03:11:54,160
Wait, you can do that?

2501
03:11:56,020 --> 03:11:56,900
Oh my god.

2502
03:11:58,960 --> 03:12:00,340
That's not fair?

2503
03:12:01,520 --> 03:12:01,720
Oh

2504
03:12:05,490 --> 03:12:07,930
my god, there's so many.

2505
03:12:11,430 --> 03:12:17,270
Oh my god, there's so many ladies ladies, ladies, please ladies

2506
03:12:20,790 --> 03:12:42,370
Of course they can't Get dodged forever Get out of here Get out of here, get dodged, oh shit Alright, okay, I gotta beat Oh my god Okay, nice.

2507
03:12:43,130 --> 03:12:46,210
Oh my god, a stupid fucking sword

2508
03:12:49,290 --> 03:12:51,570
How the fuck did I kill the first one so fast?

2509
03:12:53,810 --> 03:12:54,910
Can't dodge us forever

2510
03:13:00,050 --> 03:13:15,250
See, I told you she can't dodge it forever my fist has no cooldown Discovery that will allow Gotham to rise like Lazarus becoming a beacon of hope for this world Oh.

2511
03:13:16,670 --> 03:13:17,030
Unconscious.

2512
03:13:18,550 --> 03:13:19,010
Unconscious.

2513
03:13:20,370 --> 03:13:20,510
See?

2514
03:13:20,710 --> 03:13:21,850
Look, they're all alive.

2515
03:13:23,970 --> 03:13:25,410
Who's dead?

2516
03:13:26,030 --> 03:13:29,750
Who fucking actually died?

2517
03:13:30,810 --> 03:13:31,970
I seem to see so...

2518
03:13:31,970 --> 03:13:32,750
That's not me.

2519
03:13:33,150 --> 03:13:34,150
Batman doesn't kill.

2520
03:13:34,850 --> 03:13:37,570
...providing clean, safe energy.

2521
03:13:39,890 --> 03:13:40,250
...

2522
03:13:40,250 --> 03:13:40,570
...

2523
03:13:40,570 --> 03:13:40,690
...

2524
03:13:40,690 --> 03:13:40,810
...

2525
03:13:44,390 --> 03:13:44,910
Okay.

2526
03:13:48,230 --> 03:13:49,410
Are we in Bioshock?

2527
03:13:50,050 --> 03:13:50,170
Oh

2528
03:13:55,950 --> 03:13:58,570
my god, it's Bioshock.

2529
03:14:00,250 --> 03:14:02,450
I'm in the underwater city.

2530
03:14:05,150 --> 03:14:05,770
Yeah, counter.

2531
03:14:05,910 --> 03:14:06,410
It's Y.

2532
03:14:06,890 --> 03:14:07,770
It's literally this.

2533
03:14:12,990 --> 03:14:13,690
It's Rapture.

2534
03:14:14,730 --> 03:14:15,470
It's Rapture.

2535
03:14:15,490 --> 03:14:17,830
But the door looks like it's been sealed for decades.

2536
03:14:17,830 --> 03:14:19,110
It literally does look like Rapture.

2537
03:14:19,990 --> 03:14:22,310
The assassins must be using another way to get through.

2538
03:14:24,950 --> 03:14:28,590
These must be the famous mechanical guardians of Wonder City.

2539
03:14:29,690 --> 03:14:31,890
It looks like their inner workings were very advanced.

2540
03:14:32,610 --> 03:14:36,530
I'm detecting a kind of memory tape they used, almost a primitive video.

2541
03:14:37,450 --> 03:14:40,730
Perhaps I can scan and analyze it.

2542
03:14:41,850 --> 03:14:44,130
Would you kindly go take care of the Joker?

2543
03:14:45,630 --> 03:14:47,070
Scan the thing.

2544
03:14:51,380 --> 03:14:52,540
I'm hacking.

2545
03:14:53,940 --> 03:14:55,200
I'm stealing your memories.

2546
03:14:55,760 --> 03:14:56,620
Oh shit!

2547
03:14:56,880 --> 03:14:57,540
The data is incomplete.

2548
03:14:58,940 --> 03:15:02,300
This is way ahead of the technology that should have been available back then.

2549
03:15:03,400 --> 03:15:06,440
It looks like the data is stored in a shared memory pool.

2550
03:15:07,480 --> 03:15:09,400
Maybe I just gotta find the other bots.

2551
03:15:12,420 --> 03:15:14,300
I mean there's one here.

2552
03:15:18,720 --> 03:15:20,700
Come on, give me your data.

2553
03:15:21,240 --> 03:15:23,860
I gotta go find the cloud.

2554
03:15:24,740 --> 03:15:27,240
It's nice that they all have, they all share the same cloud.

2555
03:15:28,340 --> 03:15:29,700
Is this someone already scanned?

2556
03:15:34,430 --> 03:15:36,170
Thank God they all backed up.

2557
03:15:36,610 --> 03:15:37,510
Backed it up.

2558
03:15:39,630 --> 03:15:40,710
Can I do it from this guy?

2559
03:15:41,470 --> 03:15:41,870
Oh, I can.

2560
03:15:41,930 --> 03:15:42,530
That's good.

2561
03:15:46,070 --> 03:15:47,630
And then one right here.

2562
03:15:48,210 --> 03:15:48,850
Oh, shit!

2563
03:15:49,010 --> 03:15:49,910
What the fuck?

2564
03:15:50,830 --> 03:15:51,850
I knew I should have killed.

2565
03:15:55,410 --> 03:15:56,650
God damn it!

2566
03:15:57,090 --> 03:15:59,110
Fat Man, sometimes you just gotta...

2567
03:15:59,110 --> 03:15:59,950
Look what happened!

2568
03:16:02,030 --> 03:16:06,090
You didn't put her in conscious enough She should have been like a vegetable

2569
03:16:10,830 --> 03:16:15,830
Alright Get her out of here Oh my god, were they like all triplets or some shit

2570
03:16:20,840 --> 03:16:38,640

2571
03:16:39,080 --> 03:16:39,600
It's a bit...

2572
03:16:39,600 --> 03:16:40,920
I don't know why Chad dies there.

2573
03:16:42,280 --> 03:16:42,440
Alright.

2574
03:16:45,520 --> 03:16:47,440
Diagnol, welcome to Tomato Farm.

2575
03:16:47,760 --> 03:16:48,480
Welcome, welcome.

2576
03:16:50,280 --> 03:16:51,840
Did I analyze everything?

2577
03:16:53,500 --> 03:16:55,120
There's still one more here.

2578
03:16:59,320 --> 03:17:00,340
There we go.

2579
03:17:04,080 --> 03:17:05,420
I think there's like another one?

2580
03:17:06,080 --> 03:17:07,060
How many more do I need?

2581
03:17:08,020 --> 03:17:08,760
Oh, shit.

2582
03:17:08,780 --> 03:17:09,080
Shit!

2583
03:17:10,120 --> 03:17:11,220
God damn it.

2584
03:17:14,260 --> 03:17:18,240
I don't know if these are the same assassins or like...

2585
03:17:19,060 --> 03:17:22,900
Or like the same two that I literally just knocked out.

2586
03:17:25,600 --> 03:17:26,820
Alright, there we go.

2587
03:17:28,460 --> 03:17:30,140
We'll have it not scanned yet.

2588
03:17:30,560 --> 03:17:31,240
Oh, one more.

2589
03:17:31,740 --> 03:17:32,480
I see it.

2590
03:17:33,600 --> 03:17:34,400
Oh, no, I don't.

2591
03:17:34,440 --> 03:17:35,180
I've lost track.

2592
03:17:37,160 --> 03:17:38,140
I've lost track.

2593
03:17:41,060 --> 03:17:42,760
How do I get to her?

2594
03:17:43,400 --> 03:17:43,960
Oh, it's here.

2595
03:17:45,320 --> 03:17:46,600
Oh, it's new ones.

2596
03:17:46,760 --> 03:17:48,720
Oh, they take their dress codes very seriously.

2597
03:17:48,940 --> 03:17:49,720
Are you fucking...

2598
03:17:49,720 --> 03:17:50,760
Get out of here!

2599
03:17:51,080 --> 03:17:52,480
I'm trying to hack!

2600
03:17:53,560 --> 03:17:56,060
Bro, I'm trying to update my iPhone.

2601
03:18:00,240 --> 03:18:02,260
I'm so fucking rude.

2602
03:18:06,320 --> 03:18:07,580
Alright, that's fine.

2603
03:18:11,200 --> 03:18:11,760
Boom!

2604
03:18:12,680 --> 03:18:13,120
Alright.

2605
03:18:16,060 --> 03:18:18,240
Now I can fully hack.

2606
03:18:20,520 --> 03:18:22,420
God damn it.

2607
03:18:22,860 --> 03:18:24,160
Stupid iPhone.

2608
03:18:27,240 --> 03:18:30,220
I don't know which one I haven't done it yet.

2609
03:18:32,280 --> 03:18:32,960
This is a blue?

2610
03:18:33,740 --> 03:18:36,380
Oh, I guess if it's blue I haven't hacked it.

2611
03:18:37,460 --> 03:18:37,780
Okay.

2612
03:18:38,520 --> 03:18:39,800
What the fuck is that?

2613
03:18:40,880 --> 03:18:41,820
Cuddle me this.

2614
03:18:43,820 --> 03:18:44,920
Is that Titan?

2615
03:18:47,900 --> 03:18:51,240
Oh, I didn't finish.

2616
03:18:51,620 --> 03:18:51,800
Okay.

2617
03:18:52,600 --> 03:18:53,580
Because I got interrupted.

2618
03:18:54,940 --> 03:18:56,260
I didn't realize I got interrupted.

2619
03:18:59,480 --> 03:19:02,440
The assembled surveillance footage shows me where the assassin went.

2620
03:19:02,740 --> 03:19:04,540
She must have been using a secret entrance.

2621
03:19:04,940 --> 03:19:05,860
I need to find it.

2622
03:19:06,720 --> 03:19:07,640
You mean like this?

2623
03:19:08,700 --> 03:19:09,740
Wow, it's so secret.

2624
03:19:13,650 --> 03:19:15,490
Oh my god, where could that button be?

2625
03:19:16,310 --> 03:19:17,610
I guess I'll never know.

2626
03:19:17,730 --> 03:19:41,310
it looks like a sword fits here guess i'll never know oh how convenient all right put that sword in nice against the brick wall Batman never kills the world's greatest detective

2627
03:19:47,560 --> 03:19:49,140

Thank you.

2631
03:20:01,600 --> 03:20:04,320
Batman parent believes in equal rights and equal lives.

2632
03:20:04,560 --> 03:20:05,420
Thank you for the super chat.

2633
03:20:05,660 --> 03:20:05,840
Thank you.

2634
03:20:06,240 --> 03:20:06,600
Thank you.

2635
03:20:08,160 --> 03:20:09,380
Rated E for everyone.

2636
03:20:09,580 --> 03:20:10,200
Am I okay?

2637
03:20:11,540 --> 03:20:12,500
Oh my God.

2638
03:20:12,600 --> 03:20:13,840
Oh, it's in my blood.

2639
03:20:14,000 --> 03:20:15,380
I mean, it was in my bloodstream.

2640
03:20:15,980 --> 03:20:18,560
But you could tell.

2641
03:20:18,940 --> 03:20:19,460
Oh my gosh.

2642
03:20:19,500 --> 03:20:21,300
Am I in like Utopia now?

2643
03:20:23,160 --> 03:20:23,900
Walt Disney?

2644
03:20:24,740 --> 03:20:25,660
Oh my God.

2645
03:20:25,920 --> 03:20:26,300
Mom?

2646
03:20:26,580 --> 03:20:27,000

2647
03:20:27,820 --> 03:20:35,140

2651
03:21:24,740 --> 03:21:26,800
Like, what's the worst thing that could happen?

2652
03:21:28,980 --> 03:21:31,360
Feels like a lot of pros over the cons.

2653
03:21:39,120 --> 03:21:42,300
I was wondering, if I just stood there, would I have just died?

2654
03:21:44,640 --> 03:21:46,180
It's like a win-win.

2655
03:21:48,800 --> 03:21:50,180
Oh, is that my girlfriend?

2656
03:21:51,400 --> 03:21:51,980
Hey, girl.

2657
03:21:52,360 --> 03:21:53,140
I'm dying.

2658
03:21:53,740 --> 03:21:54,260
I'm dying.

2659
03:21:56,040 --> 03:21:57,320
Oh shit.

2660
03:21:58,240 --> 03:21:58,780
Hello Talia.

2661
03:21:59,620 --> 03:22:00,620
How did you find us?

2662
03:22:01,140 --> 03:22:02,680
I recognized your personal guard.

2663
03:22:03,320 --> 03:22:06,920
It was just a matter of following her.

2664
03:22:08,760 --> 03:22:09,880
Please, mistress, he tricked me.

2665
03:22:10,240 --> 03:22:10,540
Leave.

2666
03:22:11,500 --> 03:22:13,080
I will deal with you later.

2667
03:22:14,740 --> 03:22:18,000
You didn't need to get yourself arrested to see me, Bruce.

2668
03:22:18,520 --> 03:22:20,680
After that night we spent in Metropolis.

2669
03:22:21,100 --> 03:22:21,480
Oh.

2670
03:22:22,200 --> 03:22:22,580
Damn.

2671
03:22:24,460 --> 03:22:47,800

2672
03:22:54,460 --> 03:22:57,560
Like, oh my god, no, that's super age.

2673
03:22:58,860 --> 03:23:00,360
You wish to become an assassin.

2674
03:23:01,740 --> 03:23:03,320
Why should I just- She's freaked out.

2675
03:23:03,420 --> 03:23:05,520
She's like, do I have to go to the hospital too?

2676
03:23:06,060 --> 03:23:07,900
Does it look like I have a choice?

2677
03:23:08,520 --> 03:23:10,660
Are you prepared to take the demon trials?

2678
03:23:12,400 --> 03:23:16,600
You must show you are willing to take a life to save the world.

2679
03:23:16,900 --> 03:23:17,600
I'm ready.

2680
03:23:19,720 --> 03:23:22,000
Then let the trials commence.

2681
03:23:25,240 --> 03:23:26,760
Is that contagious?

2682
03:23:27,080 --> 03:23:27,300
Yeah.

2683
03:23:30,360 --> 03:23:32,200
Bro, I don't think I'm okay.

2684
03:23:32,580 --> 03:23:38,480
Anyway, I was wondering, you know what I was like, when Barbara was like, you have minutes.

2685
03:23:38,640 --> 03:23:40,700
If I stood there, could I have died.

2686
03:23:42,460 --> 03:23:43,880
Talia, I have literally minutes.

2687
03:23:43,960 --> 03:23:45,540
I don't know if I can do this trial.

2688
03:23:46,080 --> 03:23:49,320
Thousands of warriors have fallen in pursuit of the demon.

2689
03:23:49,420 --> 03:23:50,800
Bro, I'm not feeling so good.

2690
03:23:50,800 --> 03:23:53,560
Would the successors have proven to be nothing more than children.

2691
03:23:54,460 --> 03:23:56,560
Where is my immersion?

2692
03:23:58,020 --> 03:23:58,860
I've seen worse.

2693
03:23:59,360 --> 03:24:02,620
Oh my god, look at the way she's walking right now.

2694
03:24:02,720 --> 03:24:04,500
Destiny will decide your fate.

2695
03:24:06,040 --> 03:24:07,460
She knows she's got it.

2696
03:24:07,620 --> 03:24:08,440
She's a baddie.

2697
03:24:08,500 --> 03:24:09,740
I have heard these words a hundred times.

2698
03:24:10,700 --> 03:24:12,400
Let us hope you are correct.

2699
03:24:15,620 --> 03:24:17,220
She know what she got.

2700
03:24:18,980 --> 03:24:20,800
Your journey begins through this door.

2701
03:24:22,460 --> 03:24:23,340
Let's get started.

2702
03:24:24,460 --> 03:24:25,660
Are you sure, Bruce?

2703
03:24:26,280 --> 03:24:28,160
Only one man has passed this ordeal.

2704
03:24:28,760 --> 03:24:30,220
Are you trying to talk me out of this?

2705
03:24:30,440 --> 03:24:30,960
Of course not.

2706
03:24:31,160 --> 03:24:32,200
I just...

2707
03:24:32,200 --> 03:24:33,540
I just want you to be certain.

2708
03:24:33,880 --> 03:24:38,040
When the blood of the demon takes hold, you will be on your own.

2709
03:24:39,620 --> 03:24:40,420
Like always.

2710
03:24:41,680 --> 03:24:43,460
Then may the spirits be kind.

2711
03:24:53,950 --> 03:24:55,370
Just believe in me.

2712
03:24:56,270 --> 03:24:57,450
That's fucked up.

2713
03:24:58,590 --> 03:24:59,910
I thought we tight like that.

2714
03:25:02,170 --> 03:25:02,750
Oh yeah, Ration.

2715
03:25:02,910 --> 03:25:03,150
I don't know.

2716
03:25:03,170 --> 03:25:04,730
I can pronounce this thing raw, ghouls.

2717
03:25:05,210 --> 03:25:06,290
Demon Trial.

2718
03:25:07,230 --> 03:25:08,850
Simply drink from the chalice.

2719
03:25:09,530 --> 03:25:10,710
It is that simple.

2720
03:25:16,320 --> 03:25:16,880
Good.

2721
03:25:17,360 --> 03:25:18,020
What's in this?

2722
03:25:18,340 --> 03:25:25,300
Feel the blood of the demon coursed through your veins, restoring your health, and twisting your will.

2723
03:25:25,660 --> 03:25:26,880
What even was in that?

2724
03:25:29,020 --> 03:25:30,560
Your next task is simple.

2725
03:25:31,220 --> 03:25:34,300
Follow me through this world, and the trial is complete.

2726
03:25:35,260 --> 03:25:36,240
That sounds easy.

2727
03:25:37,900 --> 03:25:39,180
Just drugs, yeah.

2728
03:25:40,800 --> 03:25:43,820
Just like eight different kinds of drugs all blended in together.

2729
03:25:44,560 --> 03:25:45,060
Nothing too...

2730
03:25:45,060 --> 03:25:46,440
No, nothing too bad.

2731
03:25:47,240 --> 03:25:48,300
Wait, he said follow him.

2732
03:25:48,420 --> 03:25:49,500
Where did he go?

2733
03:25:52,360 --> 03:25:54,200
He's like, just follow me.

2734
03:25:54,620 --> 03:25:58,240
How do I follow someone that just fucking disappeared?

2735
03:26:04,280 --> 03:26:04,860
Okay.

2736
03:26:05,520 --> 03:26:07,580
Okay, it said dive bomb.

2737
03:26:07,740 --> 03:26:09,360
Okay, I did not know I'm gonna...

2738
03:26:09,420 --> 03:26:13,680
erupt into like fucking smoke and dust.

2739
03:26:22,230 --> 03:26:29,070
A steady climb to cover alternative between it didn't let me do anything there.

2740
03:26:29,990 --> 03:26:30,730
Okay, there we go.

2741
03:26:30,890 --> 03:26:32,030
I was like, so...

2742
03:26:32,030 --> 03:26:33,410
It's so weird.

2743
03:26:48,460 --> 03:26:50,220
I thought that...

2744
03:26:50,220 --> 03:26:54,040
I legitimately thought that that was a ledge that I could... Okay, guys.

2745
03:26:54,380 --> 03:26:55,380
I would say I...

2746
03:26:55,400 --> 03:26:57,140
I thought that was a ledge.

2747
03:26:57,440 --> 03:27:01,080
I thought that was a ledge, okay.

2748
03:27:01,480 --> 03:27:04,700
I thought it was a ledge that I could land on.

2749
03:27:05,260 --> 03:27:07,140
How the fuck was I supposed to know?

2750
03:27:07,340 --> 03:27:08,740
I can't touch that.

2751
03:27:10,960 --> 03:27:12,140
Where did he go?

2752
03:27:12,740 --> 03:27:14,680
Oh my god, it's time.

2753
03:27:15,220 --> 03:27:16,540
Oh my god!

2754
03:27:17,160 --> 03:27:17,560
Okay.

2755
03:27:18,080 --> 03:27:19,660
I didn't realize it was time.

2756
03:27:20,420 --> 03:27:22,260
I thought it would stop moving.

2757
03:27:35,490 --> 03:27:51,410
okay all right stopped i had to land there for it to stop prove if you are strong enough to leave my forces to save this world from the evil that is destroying it what just fucking gliding i'm just gliding how does that prove anything

2758
03:27:54,470 --> 03:27:57,550
how the fuck does gliding even prove anything

2759
03:28:07,210 --> 03:28:11,190
oh god i'm not gonna make it i'm not gonna make it or not.

2760
03:28:22,740 --> 03:28:22,880
Alright.

2761
03:28:27,960 --> 03:28:29,680
Oh my god, I already fucked it up.

2762
03:28:29,800 --> 03:28:30,640
I'm so lost.

2763
03:28:32,020 --> 03:28:32,700
Oh no.

2764
03:28:33,480 --> 03:28:35,000
Oh no, it's over.

2765
03:28:35,580 --> 03:28:36,760
It's so over.

2766
03:28:38,700 --> 03:28:39,340
Goodbye.

2767
03:28:40,420 --> 03:28:41,920
It's so over.

2768
03:28:44,520 --> 03:28:46,480
It's so hard to pull up.

2769
03:28:46,580 --> 03:28:47,420
I don't know why.

2770
03:28:51,820 --> 03:28:53,520
Okay, there you go.

2771
03:28:59,060 --> 03:29:01,220
Oh my god, it's like Dolphining in Apex again.

2772
03:29:01,360 --> 03:29:03,260
I feel like I'm playing Apex again.

2773
03:29:03,760 --> 03:29:05,720
I feel...

2774
03:29:05,720 --> 03:29:08,140
It's literally the Apex Dolphining.

2775
03:29:10,820 --> 03:29:11,760
What the fuck?

2776
03:29:12,380 --> 03:29:13,300
Get out of here.

2777
03:29:17,650 --> 03:29:19,670
But I can't push him off the ledge.

2778
03:29:19,830 --> 03:29:20,790
I hate that.

2779
03:29:21,950 --> 03:29:23,330
Bro, I'm fucking...

2780
03:29:23,330 --> 03:29:24,250
Get out of here!

2781
03:29:33,890 --> 03:29:35,510
Wait, I can't dodge that.

2782
03:29:35,530 --> 03:29:36,410
I'm trying to.

2783
03:29:44,010 --> 03:29:45,270
That's right, Sandman.

2784
03:29:45,450 --> 03:29:48,170
Are you the one I have searched for, Detective?

2785
03:29:49,110 --> 03:29:51,350
The one to succeed me.

2786
03:29:55,960 --> 03:30:07,680
I did press Y, but if I have, like, I realize, like, if I'm pressed, if my analog stick is, like, um, it's, like, pressed, it, like, doesn't register my Y.

2787
03:30:07,960 --> 03:30:08,600
It's so weird.

2788
03:30:10,200 --> 03:30:11,240
I'm not supposed to land in here.

2789
03:30:14,800 --> 03:30:16,280
Are you serious?

2790
03:30:18,520 --> 03:30:21,620
Yeah, like my analog stick is like...

2791
03:30:21,620 --> 03:30:22,900
Because sometimes I have my analog stick.

2792
03:30:23,040 --> 03:30:24,960
I'm just like moving my analog stick with it, too.

2793
03:30:25,780 --> 03:30:27,620
And then like the Y doesn't register.

2794
03:30:27,960 --> 03:30:28,580
It's so weird.

2795
03:30:29,180 --> 03:30:33,140
Imagine the good that you could do with such a gift.

2796
03:30:42,870 --> 03:30:44,370
Oh, I think I'm going to hit that.

2797
03:30:55,120 --> 03:30:56,960
I forgot the rest of it.

2798
03:30:57,200 --> 03:30:59,160
I was like, why am I not flying?

2799
03:31:04,270 --> 03:31:05,730
Okay, there you go.

2800
03:31:07,130 --> 03:31:08,410
I was like, well, I don't understand.

2801
03:31:10,330 --> 03:31:16,690
I swear to God, if my leg touches that, oh my God, oh my God, I fucked up.

2802
03:31:16,990 --> 03:31:17,390
No!

2803
03:31:19,850 --> 03:31:20,530

2806
03:32:08,280 --> 03:32:08,280
Hours?

2807
03:32:08,640 --> 03:32:10,540
I mean, I had minutes before.

2808
03:32:10,820 --> 03:32:11,760
I'll take those.

2809
03:32:12,980 --> 03:32:14,120
I'll take that.

2810
03:32:17,120 --> 03:32:20,360
Oh, that's like expanding it to, like, 20 years.

2811
03:32:22,000 --> 03:32:22,740
This way?

2812
03:32:27,500 --> 03:32:27,980
Okay.

2813
03:32:35,080 --> 03:32:36,280
Alright, nice.

2814
03:32:37,220 --> 03:32:37,660
Yay!

2815
03:32:43,860 --> 03:32:44,500
Oops.

2816
03:32:49,840 --> 03:32:50,500
Get out of here.

2817
03:32:50,680 --> 03:32:51,480
Wait, watch this.

2818
03:32:52,200 --> 03:32:52,240
Boom.

2819
03:32:53,200 --> 03:32:54,140
Oh, oh, that works.

2820
03:32:56,360 --> 03:32:58,020
That's our intention.

2821
03:33:01,900 --> 03:33:03,100
Look at that.

2822
03:33:04,360 --> 03:33:08,740
It is time to face me in person.

2823
03:33:10,000 --> 03:33:11,280
Complete this final challenge.

2824
03:33:11,300 --> 03:33:16,200
And the blood of the devil gives you the gift of eternal life

2825
03:33:19,500 --> 03:33:21,700

2826
03:33:29,230 --> 03:33:32,010

Oh, I'm in a house Now Come and find me.

2829
03:33:46,690 --> 03:33:48,390
Collect your great lord.

2830
03:33:48,630 --> 03:33:49,170
Oh, shit.

2831
03:33:50,590 --> 03:33:51,670
They like me now.

2832
03:33:52,210 --> 03:33:53,410
I'm part of you guys.

2833
03:33:53,710 --> 03:33:54,750
I'm part of the crew.

2834
03:33:56,750 --> 03:33:58,510
Solid Snake, thank you for the super chat.

2835
03:33:58,670 --> 03:33:59,390
Thank you, thank you.

2836
03:33:59,650 --> 03:34:00,110
Relatable.

2837
03:34:00,330 --> 03:34:05,190
Silk song was a bit harder after all the abuse the A-button had with all the mashing hidden monster out of it.

2838
03:34:05,330 --> 03:34:06,050
Thank you for the super chat.

2839
03:34:06,230 --> 03:34:07,150
Thank you, thank you.

2840
03:34:08,210 --> 03:34:09,250
You did it.

2841
03:34:10,010 --> 03:34:11,170
You sound surprised.

2842
03:34:11,910 --> 03:34:12,790
Of course not.

2843
03:34:12,890 --> 03:34:13,990
I always had faith.

2844
03:34:14,930 --> 03:34:15,730
Where's Rache?

2845
03:34:16,210 --> 03:34:17,210
I need to see him now.

2846
03:34:17,470 --> 03:34:18,430
I'm running out of time.

2847
03:34:19,070 --> 03:34:21,270
Your final challenge awaits you through this door.

2848
03:34:22,890 --> 03:34:25,250
I pray the spirits will be kind.

2849
03:34:32,870 --> 03:34:33,790
You're back!

2850
03:34:35,370 --> 03:34:37,550
How many times I have to kill you, old man?

2851
03:34:39,510 --> 03:34:42,410
Oh, he is not looking so good.

2852
03:34:42,710 --> 03:34:44,530
Wait, do you also have Super 8?

2853
03:34:44,970 --> 03:34:45,810
What the fuck?

2854
03:34:46,010 --> 03:34:47,970
I thought you were- Joker and Oxclus!

2855
03:34:48,250 --> 03:34:49,730
Oh no, you're just fucking dead.

2856
03:34:49,810 --> 03:34:51,190
Never mind, you're just a zombie.

2857
03:34:51,750 --> 03:34:52,270
Never mind.

2858
03:34:52,290 --> 03:34:54,290
It is your destiny.

2859
03:34:55,110 --> 03:34:56,490
I will never kill.

2860
03:34:57,330 --> 03:34:58,570
Not even you.

2861
03:34:59,030 --> 03:34:59,250
What?

2862
03:34:59,690 --> 03:35:00,650
You lied to me.

2863
03:35:00,770 --> 03:35:02,750
I needed a sample of your father's blood.

2864
03:35:02,930 --> 03:35:03,850
I will never kill.

2865
03:35:05,070 --> 03:35:06,470
The fucking biggest liar.

2866
03:35:06,470 --> 03:35:07,230
I love her.

2867
03:35:08,090 --> 03:35:08,210
I love her.

2868
03:35:08,210 --> 03:35:09,070
To help you.

2869
03:35:09,890 --> 03:35:11,350
Use my sword.

2870
03:35:12,850 --> 03:35:14,810
Take it all.

2871
03:35:15,430 --> 03:35:15,990
No.

2872
03:35:16,150 --> 03:35:16,490
No.

2873
03:35:16,910 --> 03:35:19,410
And that is your final...

2874
03:35:19,410 --> 03:35:20,970
That's funny, Batman.

2875
03:35:29,770 --> 03:35:36,590
Yeah, but the mountains of debt that I've prescribed over the criminals will surely kill them.

2876
03:35:38,550 --> 03:35:40,070
But that's their own choice.

2877
03:35:40,550 --> 03:35:41,690
Not because of me.

2878
03:35:42,770 --> 03:35:43,970
Okay, well, now...

2879
03:35:43,970 --> 03:35:45,010
Oh, he's back alive!

2880
03:35:45,250 --> 03:35:45,590
Okay.

2881
03:35:46,910 --> 03:35:48,750
Wait, can you just do that?

2882
03:35:49,150 --> 03:35:52,750
Wait, can I just use this fucking pool?

2883
03:35:53,510 --> 03:35:59,130
Now, only one of us can leave this chamber alive.

2884
03:35:59,330 --> 03:36:01,070
Wait, I could have used that to cure me!

2885
03:36:14,580 --> 03:36:17,780
What kind of consequences does it have?

2886
03:36:21,040 --> 03:36:25,480
I think like, Batman's already sort of insane if you think about it.

2887
03:36:26,040 --> 03:36:28,240
Like, he's literally hanging by a thread.

2888
03:36:33,600 --> 03:36:35,800
I feel like he's already there.

2889
03:36:36,820 --> 03:36:38,940
I don't think he's, like, sane at all.

2890
03:36:40,160 --> 03:36:44,160
Like, who dresses up as a fucking bat, to be fair?

2891
03:36:52,750 --> 03:36:54,470
Like, if your first...

2892
03:36:56,690 --> 03:37:01,150
If your first response is to dress up as a bat, Jesus Christ.

2893
03:37:05,130 --> 03:37:25,730
your parents died and then like try and like defend the city of crime like i don't think you're mentally like saying witness the true power of my mentally stable what the do i do with that oh okay

It's stupid.

2897
03:37:49,480 --> 03:37:50,900
It's so stupid.

2898
03:37:51,480 --> 03:37:54,140
I'm sorry, this is a dumbass boss fight.

2899
03:37:54,940 --> 03:37:56,480
I don't like this boss fight.

2900
03:37:57,500 --> 03:37:58,720
It's just stupid.

2901
03:38:01,800 --> 03:38:03,120
This is so dumb.

2902
03:38:06,100 --> 03:38:09,900
Don't worry, my sad people are a little Save me.

2903
03:38:18,150 --> 03:38:19,510
It's so goofy.

2904
03:38:25,330 --> 03:38:26,350
Cut his throat!

2905
03:38:26,770 --> 03:38:27,250
Cut his throat!

2906
03:38:27,430 --> 03:38:28,450
Fat Man doesn't kill!

2907
03:38:28,590 --> 03:38:29,090
Cut his throat!

2908
03:38:29,610 --> 03:38:31,430
Clean of the scum of humanity.

2909
03:38:31,610 --> 03:38:32,790
Only we can do this.

2910
03:38:34,290 --> 03:38:35,550
My father is old.

2911
03:38:35,770 --> 03:38:37,190
His time is over.

2912
03:38:38,150 --> 03:38:39,570
Hours is just beginning.

2913
03:38:40,870 --> 03:38:41,810
Take his blade.

2914
03:38:42,390 --> 03:38:42,990
Kill him.

2915
03:38:43,930 --> 03:38:45,230
Accept your destiny.

2916
03:38:46,310 --> 03:39:12,270
except our destiny you know I can't do that tell you then beloved you will have to die what do you mean I thought we'd be together for ever okay but what if oh my God.

2917
03:39:14,350 --> 03:39:15,730
That's fucking right.

2918
03:39:16,450 --> 03:39:17,250
Gotcha now!

2919
03:39:22,180 --> 03:39:26,640
Jesus, when he does that dash thing, it throws me off.

2920
03:39:29,660 --> 03:39:30,300
Yeah.

2921
03:39:36,300 --> 03:39:36,680
Okay.

2922
03:39:40,620 --> 03:39:42,580
Our numbers are too great.

2923
03:39:45,520 --> 03:39:46,160
Oh, fuck this.

2924
03:39:46,260 --> 03:39:47,060
I'm just gonna hit you.

2925
03:39:47,680 --> 03:39:49,020
I'm just gonna beat you up.

2926
03:39:56,290 --> 03:39:58,330
Oh my god, I didn't see him.

2927
03:40:03,340 --> 03:40:06,780
I don't know how to dodge that other guy when he does that dash.

2928
03:40:07,160 --> 03:40:08,580
You cannot beat us.

2929
03:40:09,880 --> 03:40:12,280
How do you dodge that dash over there?

2930
03:40:16,730 --> 03:40:17,850
Like this dash.

2931
03:40:18,150 --> 03:40:18,750
Do I just press A?

2932
03:40:19,790 --> 03:40:21,290
But I have to have someone else there.

2933
03:40:21,870 --> 03:40:22,430
Oh, is it A?

2934
03:40:22,570 --> 03:40:22,830
Okay.

2935
03:40:24,910 --> 03:40:25,850
Yeah, it was A.

2936
03:40:26,110 --> 03:40:26,210
Okay.

2937
03:40:26,830 --> 03:40:27,910
Okay, I know now.

2938
03:40:33,580 --> 03:40:34,280
What?

2939
03:40:34,620 --> 03:40:36,740
You should have joined us.

2940
03:40:37,260 --> 03:40:38,400
That's not fair.

2941
03:40:41,000 --> 03:40:41,380
Okay.

2942
03:40:43,160 --> 03:40:44,120
Oh, where is he?

2943
03:40:44,520 --> 03:40:46,840
I swear to God, it's a taser.

2944
03:40:46,900 --> 03:40:48,080
It's taser time.

2945
03:40:48,900 --> 03:40:51,620
It's a fucking stupid ass taser.

2946
03:40:56,760 --> 03:40:58,600
It's taser time, buddy.

2947
03:40:59,160 --> 03:40:59,720
Oh shit.

2948
03:40:59,860 --> 03:41:00,480
Oh shit.

2949
03:41:01,120 --> 03:41:01,780
Oh shit.

2950
03:41:03,720 --> 03:41:04,960
Where's the horde?

2951
03:41:05,720 --> 03:41:07,400
Where the fuck is the horde?

2952
03:41:08,400 --> 03:41:09,240
Taser tab.

2953
03:41:15,330 --> 03:41:16,430
Taser tab.

2954
03:41:17,730 --> 03:41:18,620
So stupid.

2955
03:41:19,350 --> 03:41:21,010
This is the stupidest boss fight ever.

2956
03:41:22,490 --> 03:41:26,470
I literally hate this boss fight because of how dumb this is.

2957
03:41:28,590 --> 03:41:30,350
There's such a dumb boss fight.

2958
03:41:39,100 --> 03:41:40,940
Okay, that was bullshit.

2959
03:41:44,780 --> 03:41:47,780
The slowly rotating soldier.

2960
03:41:49,340 --> 03:41:50,080
Counter,

2961
03:41:53,500 --> 03:41:55,540
counter, counter, counter, counter, counter, counter, counter, counter.

2962
03:41:55,860 --> 03:41:57,180
You don't use the gun, bitch.

2963
03:42:02,360 --> 03:42:03,320
That's right.

2964
03:42:03,560 --> 03:42:04,380
Get Jojo.

2965
03:42:14,650 --> 03:42:15,490
What are you doing?

2966
03:42:16,350 --> 03:42:19,770
Listen to me, detective, and listen well.

2967
03:42:20,950 --> 03:42:23,110
You will kill me.

2968
03:42:23,970 --> 03:42:31,970
Lead the League of Assassins because if you do not join us, I will kill why does that have to be you have ever loved?

2969
03:42:32,510 --> 03:42:34,390
What was it part of the plan?

2970
03:42:34,970 --> 03:42:43,730
Don't tell cat woman don't sh Don't tell cat woman that she's not listening is she?

2971
03:42:46,090 --> 03:42:51,350
That loose back on his lieutenant from Brian and leaving them do it Do it

2972
03:43:00,490 --> 03:43:30,250

2973
03:43:30,710 --> 03:43:31,650
terrible taste in women.

2974
03:43:32,790 --> 03:43:34,310
He's like, I can fix her.

2975
03:43:35,550 --> 03:43:37,930
But he could never fix her.

2976
03:43:38,550 --> 03:43:39,810
You two deserve each other.

2977
03:43:42,250 --> 03:43:43,810
You're looking old, Rage.

2978
03:43:44,510 --> 03:43:46,010
What's really going on here?

2979
03:43:46,530 --> 03:43:50,050
I have used the Lazarus Pit too many times.

2980
03:43:51,310 --> 03:43:53,110
I've lived 600 years.

2981
03:43:54,430 --> 03:43:57,490
My mind and body cannot take much more.

2982
03:43:58,150 --> 03:44:04,710
Each time I enter the pit, I am frightened of what will come out.

2983
03:44:05,790 --> 03:44:07,810
The Lazarus pit has corrupted your mind.

2984
03:44:08,290 --> 03:44:09,110
Think about it.

2985
03:44:09,870 --> 03:44:15,190
If your pit falls into the wrong hands, you'll be powerless to stop centuries of destruction.

2986
03:44:16,510 --> 03:44:18,950
This is your chance for redemption, Rage.

2987
03:44:19,950 --> 03:44:23,310
Call off your crusade, or I'll be back for you.

2988
03:44:28,150 --> 03:45:47,010

I don't know, I'll fucking backtrack this.

2992
03:46:38,920 --> 03:46:41,080
Oh my god, I wish there were fast travel.

2993
03:46:41,240 --> 03:46:42,600
I'm legitimately lost.

2994
03:46:43,480 --> 03:46:45,420
I don't know how to backtrack any of this.

2995
03:46:47,620 --> 03:46:50,080
There's those 2,000 people, I guess.

2996
03:46:52,100 --> 03:46:54,540
There's no way all 2,000 of these people live.

2997
03:46:59,140 --> 03:47:00,340
Oh, it's back here.

2998
03:47:02,040 --> 03:47:29,380

That's true.

3000
03:47:35,400 --> 03:47:37,200
I don't know how he does it.

3001
03:47:37,960 --> 03:47:39,920
How the fuck does Batman do it?

3002
03:47:41,180 --> 03:47:43,140
I don't think any of us would hesitate.

3003
03:47:51,430 --> 03:47:52,170
Goddamn Riddler.

3004
03:47:53,930 --> 03:47:56,310
You're not gonna get any of that money back, Riddler.

3005
03:47:58,770 --> 03:48:01,690
Like this investment isn't even worth it.

3006
03:48:03,310 --> 03:48:03,570
Yeah.

3007
03:48:04,210 --> 03:48:04,550
Cable.

3008
03:48:05,870 --> 03:48:07,170
I was finished here.

3009
03:48:07,750 --> 03:48:08,550
We just need to wait.

3010
03:48:09,390 --> 03:48:11,990
Then head into the tunnels and take out the rest of them.

3011
03:48:12,890 --> 03:48:13,350
Can't wait.

3012
03:48:13,810 --> 03:48:14,770
It'll be a regular...

3013
03:48:14,770 --> 03:48:15,890
I'll get out of here.

3014
03:48:19,590 --> 03:48:21,070
Guys, you know how I also eat it?

3015
03:48:21,090 --> 03:48:22,090
Thank you for the rain.

3016
03:48:22,310 --> 03:48:22,430
Thank you.

3017
03:48:22,570 --> 03:48:23,050
Thank you.

3018
03:48:23,250 --> 03:48:24,870
How the fuck do I get out of here?

3019
03:48:24,990 --> 03:48:26,250
Where did I come from?

3020
03:48:26,770 --> 03:48:28,370
This map isn't helpful.

3021
03:48:28,850 --> 03:48:30,890
It just says restricted area.

3022
03:48:31,270 --> 03:48:32,310
I'm going to get to the museum.

3023
03:48:32,930 --> 03:48:33,750
Take out Penguin.

3024
03:48:34,270 --> 03:48:34,910
What is that?

3025
03:48:35,110 --> 03:48:35,810
It's the back.

3026
03:48:37,790 --> 03:48:38,850
Oh, I can't...

3027
03:48:38,850 --> 03:48:39,170
Well, I guess...

3028
03:48:39,190 --> 03:48:39,810
I'll just die.

3029
03:48:40,110 --> 03:48:40,350
Fuck it.

3030
03:48:44,490 --> 03:48:44,890
Okay.

3031
03:48:45,890 --> 03:48:47,030
How does he see me?

3032
03:48:47,130 --> 03:48:48,050
It's just smoke!

3033
03:48:53,350 --> 03:48:55,170
I didn't realize he had heat sensors.

3034
03:48:56,150 --> 03:48:57,510
That's my bad.

3035
03:49:07,280 --> 03:49:08,160
Gotta get out of here.

3036
03:49:09,400 --> 03:49:10,420
I don't think he saw me.

3037
03:49:11,620 --> 03:49:12,620
I think he saw me.

3038
03:49:19,990 --> 03:49:21,030
Oh shit!

3039
03:49:21,430 --> 03:49:22,270
He sniped me.

3040
03:49:24,210 --> 03:49:27,170
Rice, thank you for five gift and cheers, thank you, thank you.

3041
03:49:27,310 --> 03:49:28,250
I'm so confused.

3042
03:49:28,410 --> 03:49:29,390
Like, where am I?

3043
03:49:29,710 --> 03:49:30,770
Where am I?

3044
03:49:31,350 --> 03:49:33,250
I don't know where I...

3045
03:49:33,250 --> 03:49:33,590
No!

3046
03:49:34,650 --> 03:49:35,410
Yes, I know.

3047
03:49:36,130 --> 03:49:37,070

3048
03:49:40,390 --> 03:49:41,990
I'm gonna call it here.

3049
03:49:42,710 --> 03:49:44,050
I'm too lost, right?

3050
03:49:44,110 --> 03:49:47,150
I'm too tired to backtrack out of this hellhole.

3051
03:49:47,430 --> 03:49:49,130
I'm too tired to backtrack.

3052
03:49:49,150 --> 03:50:50,610
