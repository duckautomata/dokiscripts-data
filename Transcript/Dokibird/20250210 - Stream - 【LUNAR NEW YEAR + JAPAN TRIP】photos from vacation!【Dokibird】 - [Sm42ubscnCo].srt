00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,570
I don't know how to use this.

44
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,310
I'm so dumb.

45
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,770

46
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:36,650
No!

47
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,420

53
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,320
How do I get this off?

54
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,720
How do you...

55
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,440
How do you remove it?

56
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,060
How do you...

57
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,980
Oh my god, it's like super glued to my head!

00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:12,860

00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,840
It's super glued to my head!

60
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,200
I can't remove it!

61
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,620
Okay, remove...

62
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,140
Okay, there we go.

00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,580
There we go, that should be fine.

64
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,600
Now I'm okay.

65
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,720
I'm okay, guys.

66
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,680
I swear to god.

67
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,540
I'm okay, guys.

68
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,400
I swear to god.

69
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,640
Everything is okay.

70
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,660
Everything is...

71
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,580
It's not okay, but everything is okay, guys.

72
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,660
I swear to god.

73
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,760
I'm gonna watch a tutorial real quick, guys.

74
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,500
Oh my god.

75
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:53,680
Palette to pin items behind layers We're doing it live.

76
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,620
Wait, what happened?

77
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,560
Why is there one of them?

78
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,680
What happened to the other one?

79
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:02,230
Wait!

80
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,050
What did I do?

81
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,270
Other one!

82
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,490
Oh my god!

83
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,210
I don't know what I did.

84
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,590
Guys, one of them is gone.

85
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:16,750
Oh my god.

86
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,270
Guys, I don't know what happened.

87
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,430
One of them disappeared.

88
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,930
What happened to it?

89
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,130
Okay, now I have one of them.

90
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,910
I think that's more manageable now.

91
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,530
I think.

92
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,950
Yeah, that's definitely more...

93
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,470
What happened to it?

94
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,990
Look, there's only one!

95
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,270
What happened to the other one?

96
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:44,650
What?

97
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,510
What happened?

98
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,210
I was watching my YouTube tutorial.

99
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,430
It just disappeared.

100
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,410
It just...

101
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,690
It just disappeared.

102
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,410
What happened to the other one?

103
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,030
Oh my god!

104
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:00,850
Okay, wait.

105
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,230
Let me finish watching this YouTube tutorial video.

106
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,370
Alright, let me make sure...

107
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,510
Chrome, you can't hear Chrome.

108
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,130
Oh, thank god.

109
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:06,410
Alright.

110
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:07,410
Alright.

111
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,050
Alright, Miss VTuber.

112
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,130
That clearly has more experience than me.

113
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,430
Okay.

114
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,990
Okay, I just have to keep holding it.

115
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:23,690
Okay.

116
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,050
I'm holding it.

117
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,690
This is a fucking liar!

118
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,330
She said if you keep holding it, a new window will pop up!

119
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,990
This fucking bitch.

120
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:36,810
She lied.

121
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,830
You must be like...

122
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,150
You must be like...

123
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,930
What the fuck is she talking about?

124
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,170
Okay, so...

125
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,730
Okay, so this cool...

126
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:52,830
Look, I'm trying to figure out how these VTubers do these cool dressing up things.

127
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,750
And I was like, oh my god.

128
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,950
I wanna be a cool VTuber.

129
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:57,970
You like that?

130
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,570
I have an ALR99 SMG right here.

131
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,910
I got...

132
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,890
I got a gun right here.

133
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:08,850
You guys like that?

134
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,070
Get rid of it!

135
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,330
I fucked up!

136
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,890
How do I get rid of it?

137
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,830
I just

138
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,680
got a gun.

139
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,180
Okay, let me figure out how to get rid of my gun real quick.

140
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,260
I...

141
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,380
No!

142
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,400
Okay, does it work if I just click the gun?

143
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,020
If I just click...

144
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,560
Guys, it's okay.

145
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,480
Happy Lunar New Year.

146
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,220
I know I'm late.

147
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,200
Oh my god.

148
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,000
What happened?

149
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:54,180
I'm trying to do something cool, but it's not happening right now.

150
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,120
It's not happening.

151
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,900
I've been trying to do something cool, but it ain't happening at the moment.

152
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:09,080
Stuff is not going as well as I would have liked it right now.

153
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:15,480
Well, the most disgusting of your first 12 months of monetization is it's literally the last one.

154
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,640
Anton, thank you for the magenta suit.

155
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,960
Thank you, thank you.

156
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:20,840
Alright, look.

157
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,940
Okay, we're gonna figure this out together.

158
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:23,780
We are...

159
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,360
Okay, now there's like...

160
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,060
Now there's two.

161
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,660
How did I made it one?

162
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,060
What happened to the other?

163
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,580
Oh, no.

164
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,000
Now it's stuck on my head again.

165
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,100
Oh, fuck.

166
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,460
It's stuck in my... How did I do it?

167
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,480
I want one.

168
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,560
How did I do that?

169
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,460
There's so many things.

170
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,960
I don't know how I'm doing this.

171
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:45,940
Like...

172
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,760
How is there one?

173
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,280
Like...

174
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,720
Okay, now there's two again.

175
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,180
There's two.

176
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:57,560
They said if I hold it, a window will pop up.

177
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,820
It's lying to me.

178
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,760
How did I...

179
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,380
How did I get it to...

180
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,080
How did I made it one?

181
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,720
What did I do?

182
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,660
What did I...

183
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,460
At least...

184
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,180
At least the gun's gone.

185
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,240
At least I got the gun out of the way.

186
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,820
Wait, is it right click?

187
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,140
There's no way.

188
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,400
It's not right click.

189
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,420
I don't believe you.

190
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,860
I don't believe you.

191
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,740
There's no window popping out.

192
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,560
Okay, so like...

193
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,300
If you guys are wondering how people dress up their skin suits, like...

194
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:38,460
There's like this cool thing you can do that pops up a window where you can...

195
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,920
Where you can dress yourself up.

196
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,460
But then like...

197
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,260
Why is it not working?

198
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,640
Why is it...

199
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:52,960
But like, for some reason it's not working for me.

200
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,320
Like...

201
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,860
I did it before.

202
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,100
Like, I did it before.

203
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,440
Oh my god.

204
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,480
I'm gonna...

205
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,800
Like, I don't know what happened.

206
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,500
I don't know.

207
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,980
Like, I don't know what happened to me.

208
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,180
What happened?

209
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,780
Maybe you're just special.

210
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,140
But why doesn't it happen anymore?

211
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,700
I don't understand.

212
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,640
I don't...

213
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,380
Guys, I don't understand.

214
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,640
Why does it do this to me?

215
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,100
I...

216
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,720
Oh my god.

217
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,060
I just...

218
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,740
There's literally one instruction.

219
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,720
It's like click on the asset and hold it.

220
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,740
That's the most simple instruction I've ever heard.

221
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,100
No, I'm not married.

222
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,680
What the fuck are you talking about?

223
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,480
That's why I'll be single forever.

224
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,180
So I can farm red pockets for the rest of my life.

225
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,400
I'll be like 90 years old and I'll be like

226
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:21,680
And then I'll still get my red pocket money.

227
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,160
She's just like me.

228
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,920
I'll never have to give children red pocket money.

229
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,080
And I'll still farm it.

230
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,320
That's how...

231
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,140
How did I made it one?

232
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,160
Oh my god.

233
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,760
Oh my god.

234
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,200
I'm gonna freak out.

235
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,290
I wanna do this.

236
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,370
I wanna dress up.

237
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:53,230
It's not fair.

238
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,970
Why can't I dress up as well?

239
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,170
I wanna dress up.

240
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,930
I don't understand.

241
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,450
Why won't you let me dress up?

242
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,770
Why won't you let me?

243
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,550
Why?

244
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:13,170
Why?

245
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,170
Let me be cute.

246
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:23,310
Dom, thank you for the magenta super.

247
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,070
Thank you.

248
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:24,850
Thank you.

249
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:25,930
Already a year?

250
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,030
It's so crazy to see you fly high like this.

251
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,110
Anyway, I wanna ask you to consider trying your head in a rap song.

252
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,930
You think you'll be able to just go with the flow?

253
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:36,430
I think you should since nothing can stop you at all.

254
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:37,970
Thank you for the magenta super.

255
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,190
Thank you.

256
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:44,150
I'm actually getting a rap song developed for an original song so like...

257
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,630
He just dropped that out of nowhere.

258
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,570
I give up.

259
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,670
I'm just gonna make it tiny.

260
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:49,350
Here we go.

261
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,430
Oh my gosh.

262
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,250
It's not even moving.

263
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,290
It's not even...

264
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,950
Like it's not the same.

265
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,590
I don't understand.

266
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,670
I wanna look cute.

267
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,570
It's not the same.

268
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,610
I don't understand.

269
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,330
Why won't you work?

270
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,780
Oh my god.

271
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,380
Oh my god.

272
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,500
Oh my god.

273
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,200
Nothing's working.

274
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,640
I got an idea.

275
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,700
Okay,

276
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:37,850
wait guys.

277
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:38,350
It's okay.

278
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,130
I'm okay.

279
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,650
I swear to god.

280
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,670
I'm okay guys.

281
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,950
I swear to god.

282
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:43,930
I'm okay.

283
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,150
I know.

284
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:45,870
I have an idea.

285
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,810
I have an idea.

286
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,690
Guys, I have an idea.

287
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,930
If this doesn't work, then I don't have ideas anymore.

288
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,330
I have an idea though.

289
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,930
Oh my god!

290
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:02,090
Does it only work in PNGs?

291
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:05,110
Are you Are you fucking kidding me?

292
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,530
Okay, I figured it out.

293
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:11,650
It doesn't pop up because I was literally... The item just doesn't work like that.

294
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:12,710
I...

295
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,930
I figured it out.

296
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,810
It literally doesn't work like that.

297
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:17,670
I...

298
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,880
It's cause the item was not... It only works on PNGs.

299
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,560
I...

300
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,120
But how did I made it one?

301
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,840
How did I do that?

302
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,260
That like blew my mind.

303
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,380
How did I made you one?

304
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,720
You were two.

305
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,420
Like, I...

306
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,400
Oh, I figured it out.

307
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,000
Oh my god.

308
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,220
Oh my god, I figured it out.

309
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,520
I'm gonna be so cute.

310
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,780
Oh my god, I figured it out.

311
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,780
Everyone!

312
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,520
Everyone, I figured it out!

313
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,580
Oh my god.

314
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,740
Oh my god.

315
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,460
Oh my god, I'm gonna be cute.

316
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,700
Oh my god, I'm gonna be cute!

317
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,940
Okay, okay, okay.

318
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,980
Okay, okay, I figured it out, everyone.

319
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,640
I figured it out, everyone.

320
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,660
Oh my god.

321
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,060
No, now you just gotta... Okay, guys.

322
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,140
Guys, give me a sec.

323
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,960
I'm working on it.

324
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,140
I'm gonna be cute now.

325
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,480
That's right.

326
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,020
Okay.

327
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,060
Right here.

328
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:30,920
Yay!

329
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,710
This is scuffed, but like...

330
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,520
Yay!

331
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:37,900
Yay!

332
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,680
Look at that!

333
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,260
Yay!

334
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,300
Yay!

335
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,340
It doesn't look as good as I thought, but like...

336
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,500
At least I got it.

337
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,080
It's like little...

338
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,840
It's like little Mickey ears.

339
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,460
I figured it out!

340
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,120
I figured it out!

341
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,180
I figured it!

342
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:00,920
I told you!

343
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,640
I told you!

344
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,980
It works!

345
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,740
It's like little Mickey ears.

346
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,300
I fucking did it!

347
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,520
Oh my god.

348
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,720
Okay, I'll put it up here.

349
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,680
Oh wait, no, now it doesn't work anymore.

350
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,340
Why did I try to fix it?

351
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,200
Yay!

352
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,240
Oh my god!

353
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,340
Yay!

354
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,970
I figured it out!

355
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:29,690
Yay!

356
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,130
Oh, it doesn't work as well.

357
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:31,770
Oh my god.

358
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,070
It does not work as well.

359
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:37,610
After like crashing out for a while, I just realized... Wait, wait.

360
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,750
Wait a minute, maybe I can fix this.

361
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:40,730
Okay.

362
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,390
Alright, come on, pop up.

363
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,290
Come on, pop up.

364
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,930
Come on, pop up.

365
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,890
Oh, why did I...

366
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:52,110
Oh man, I should've...

367
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:56,010
Oh, I should've tested it out more before I...

368
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:56,650
Oh, whatever.

369
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,130
It's fine.

370
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,390
You know, I'll take this.

371
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,070
I'll take it.

372
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,130
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

373
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:07,950
Thank you, thank you.

374
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,670
You look cute.

375
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,410
Thank you.

376
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:10,990
Thank you.

377
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,390
I worked so hard for this.

378
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:18,110
It's a little scuffed, but like, it's sort of working.

379
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:18,770
You see?

380
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,610
It sort of works.

381
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:21,650
You see that?

382
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:26,030
I can be cute just like all those other VTubers.

383
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,690
Look at...

384
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,310
I finally did it.

385
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:41,390
Alright, anyway, so I haven't... I really wanted to do this stream because I wasn't able to actually celebrate Lunar New Year with you guys.

386
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:48,690
And also, I wanted to show you guys stuff from photos and videos from Japan, from Sapporo.

387
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,360
I actually did not...

388
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,880
I didn't unpack my suitcase.

389
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:00,920
I might unpack it live and then show you guys some of the stuff I bought live and stuff.

390
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,840
That's how professional I am right now.

391
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,880
That's the degree of professionalism today.

392
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:15,240
I even set up an alarm at like...

393
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,960
I set up an alarm at like 11 AM today because I was like, oh, I gotta make sure.

394
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,960
I was like, haha, Doki, make sure you're prepared for today's stream.

395
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,200
I was like, oh, I'm so tired.

412
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:21,940

413
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:32,300
And I was like, maybe I'll sleep an extra, I'll just sleep an extra hour.

And then I was like, oh, fuck, okay, I have 30 minutes till stream, so like, that means I have 10 minutes till stream cause like, I need to walk.

423
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:21,180
Doki Amber Doge, I need to walk dad, and I came back and I was like, wait, I didn't even set up anything for the stream.

424
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:28,420
I was like, wait a minute, I didn't even set up anything for the stream!

425
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:38,520
So from 9am to like 12, 20pm I was not existing.

426
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,940
I did not exist at all.

427
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:52,180
Um, yeah, walkies are non-negotiable at all.

428
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,060
So yeah, so that was basically my morning.

429
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,900
But I did send all the pictures and videos to my Discord server so I could like, pull them.

430
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,620
I didn't even save them, by the way.

431
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:08,480
I just literally was just sending them from my phone to my PC and be like, bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu.

432
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,360
So, um, so we'll get to that soon.

433
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,000
Um, anyway, but yeah, happy Lunar New Year!

434
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,700
Uh, something Fai La.

435
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:28,540
Like, I haven't spoken Cantonese in so long because like, you know, um, yeah, there's like, it's so, you know, I live in Canada.

436
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:35,680
There's not, I mean, to be fair, I do sometimes speak Cantonese if I'm like, at a, um, at like a Cantonese restaurant or something.

437
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,400
And then I'll be like, oh, you go, you go, you go, you go, you go.

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,360
But go, but go there.

439
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,940
I feel like I have a bigger accent now because I haven't spoken it in a long time.

440
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:50,620
And so like, I feel like my accent now for Cantonese is a lot more.

441
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,800
It's a lot worse.

442
00:21:52,020 --> 00:22:01,820
Just cause like, um, uh, uh, just cause like, you know, I haven't said, like, spoken the language in so long.

443
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,840
So, uh, but go, uh, Sun Ling Fai La, Dai Ga Dai Lei, Sun Tai Kien Hon, Gong Hei Fat Choy.

446
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:21,600
Uh, but yeah, hope you guys, I really wanted to celebrate it early, but like I said, I was on vacation.

447
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,940
Uh, when Lunar New Year came, uh, like, started.

448
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:33,440
Uh, and, uh, and so like, it's been like, I don't know, like, it's been a mess.

449
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,360
Hahahaha.

450
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:39,440
The start of the Year of the Snake Has not been the best for me.

451
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,540
Not gonna lie.

452
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:51,120
I've been like sort of incredibly unlucky so far So I hope it gets better I hope okay.

453
00:22:51,220 --> 00:23:16,360
So like when I came back from japan um I found out so I thought like my lips I thought remember I told you guys that my skin got felt scraped and everything So I don't think it was from blowing my nose I think when I came back from japan my skin around my mouth just exploded or something due to the change of like Atmosphere,

454
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:37,920
I don't know something was wrong because like when I came back like the my my lips Like the skin was just peeling off and then the around the mouth too like and then I was like Oh, maybe it's because I was I was like scraping it with sandpaper when I was blowing my nose but then like But then I was like,

455
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,300
no, this is weird.

456
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:47,500
This is Lips on my skin are like falling off and I was like this is weird

457
00:23:50,780 --> 00:24:11,140
This is this is not okay, so I bought like those like, um lip balm um I like I bought like lip balm and like those like healing lip balm and stuff to like fix my lips and lotion for my mouth, yeah, I was like I feel like and then like the next couple of days like,

458
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:49,200
uh, my lips just like Uh, just like the the skin on my lips just slowly kept peeling off like and off and I was just like, oh man man This month has been pretty fucked up I was like, I was like, oh, okay Yeah, yeah So like yeah, so like day by day like my the skin on my lips just kept peeling off more and more Like just until all the I guess the dead skin was gone and but it was so annoying because like,

459
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:57,680
you know, like you can feel it just Attached to your lips, but you can't do anything about it because you don't want to force it You don't want to force it off.

460
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:06,740
So like you just have to wait until it like naturally peels off and everything so then I was just like Ah, this is thank god.

461
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,960
I don't thank god.

462
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:23,600
I'm not going outside But the thing is but because my lips were like, you know in danger, you know um I got a little like bump on like a little like because like I guess like I think that's what happened.

463
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:28,360
Like one of them I accidentally peeled off So like they're like my top upper lip.

464
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:37,260
There's like a little bump like a little like wound there like I don't know what it's called, but like it's Is that blister?

465
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,380

466
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:43,940

467
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,200
Um, I got it off first.

468
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,420
Uh, After after coming back from my vacation.

469
00:25:50,420 --> 00:26:05,280
So that's why I was like this month has been pretty fucked so like I have like this little bump that like, you know, you can tell there's like a wound there because it's like, uh, like a little red wound thing there and then It's very annoying.

470
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,120
Like it doesn't hurt.

471
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:15,360
It's just very annoying And yeah, so because like I believe i'm pretty sure like some bacteria But sorry, I shouldn't be guys.

00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:10,940
Okay, it keeps going by the way it keeps my lips exploded when I returned home

480
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:50,580
That fucking happened Uh Um and then like what I didn't tell you guys, okay, this is a story I didn't tell you guys but Um uh when I was in japan, I was so fucking stupid because I Forgot that I didn't realize because I thought I had so much stuff going on but like I forgot that uh I booked the hotel Uh until like the 30th or the 30.

481
00:27:50,760 --> 00:28:26,060
Yeah, I forgot I booked the hotel until the 30th and the thing is I forgot about it because you know algs was there so every so like the 31st the 1st was like fully booked by everywhere and I was like next to the I was like, um, I was at the like like the the like algs area too So like I forgot about that so my regular room my regular room it was um I couldn't book any more rooms in that hotel anymore.

482
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,680
And do you know what room they had left?

483
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:57,200
the most expensive suite And then all the surrounding hotels were fully booked so I was like, oh fuck what So for two nights I stayed in the most expensive suite They had And oh my god.

484
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,860
Oh, i'm not going on vacation for a while.

485
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,640
By the way.

486
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:13,280
I Because I was like, oh my god Well, it was not worth it I let you guys know right now I I felt like oh my god, but she treated like royalty.

487
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:17,260
That's a fucking lie I was not treated.

488
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:21,100
I thought okay, so Um, there was no jikku.

489
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:40,820
Okay, it looked it was okay I forgot to take pictures of the suite itself because like I was I was not in a good mood So So by the way, i'm not going on vacation for a very fucking long time after that I spent way I spent way too much money in in japan.

490
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,780
Like this has been I I was burning money.

491
00:29:43,780 --> 00:30:06,780
I was like I was like anyway, um Anyway, so there was no hotels left like there wasn't any hotels at all Like that has free vacancy and then I for the for like 31st of first I had to book the suite and like the thing is I booked my for the hotel like Months in advance,

492
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:29,220
by the way, I booked it, but I don't think but because I booked it months in advance I didn't I didn't realize 30th like I forgot 31st of first And mgs ends on the second and she has ends on the second so um Anyway, so why did I say it wasn't worth it?

493
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:37,500
Well On the day on one of the days I got to stay at the suite I got food poisoning

494
00:30:41,100 --> 00:31:00,520
I got food poisoning And then so like obviously I couldn't go outside You know because I was not a person anymore and then So I was like, I need a- I couldn't put food down in my stomach.

495
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:08,420
So I- so like, you know, I was in the suite, this giant-ass suite with like a living room, a fucking dining room.

496
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,680
The bar, like you can basically like the little like- oh, what is it called?

497
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,240
The little refrigerator where you can like- you could actually drink anything in there.

498
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:31,320
And then- and then like the- the giant-ass bed, and then like there's like- there's like two bathrooms, and like a giant fucking bathroom- like a shower, a minibar.

499
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:37,800
Yeah, so in the suite, the minibar is free, so you can literally just drink whatever the fuck you want in the minibar.

500
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,940
Anyway, that- that part doesn't matter.

501
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:47,660
So, you know, thinking I bought the most expensive suite, I'd be treated like royalty, right?

502
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:55,840
Like, you think that, you know, if anything, they'll treat you fucking well, because you're like, oh my god, she's in the suite.

503
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,280
Well- okay, I need to blow- I need to sneeze.

504
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,270
Okay, I made it myself.

505
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:13,650
Okay, anyway, I called the front desk, and I was like, Hello, can you buy me medicine?

506
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:17,250
I'm not okay right now.

507
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:20,630
Can you- Can you buy me medicine?

I can't go out.

510
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:31,930
And then the front desk was like, Sorry, ma'am.

511
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:34,050
We don't offer these services.

512
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:38,490
And then I literally was like, we cannot buy you medicine.

513
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:45,530
My reply was- I was like, okay, I guess I die?

514
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:49,090
I- I

515
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,000
- I- I just couldn't believe she said that!

516
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,600
I literally replied that back!

517
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,400
I was like, I guess I die?

518
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,720
I guess I- I can't go out.

519
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,820
I'm so dumb.

520
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,140
I'm sick.

521
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:10,180
I was like- I just couldn't believe she said that to me!

522
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,760
I was like- I was literally dying!

523
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,460
I was literally- not literally.

524
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,920
I was like, I was not a person.

525
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,380
I was not even a person anymore.

526
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:26,300
I couldn't- I couldn't believe it!

527
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:30,680
I didn't- I didn't grab tissue boxes because I used up all my tissues.

528
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,660
I'll be right back.

529
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,300
I'm back.

530
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,440
I ran- oh my god.

531
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,880
Thank you, Cactus, for pinning that message.

532
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,780
I forgot to show.

533
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,880
But yes, I do have a pajama collection right now that you can grab.

534
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,460
But yes.

535
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,680
No, I did not get my medicine in the end.

536
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:57,600
I was- I guess I- I- I can't believe- I can't- I was like- I spent so much on literally your most expensive hotel room and you can't even go- by the way, there was a- there was a fucking Lawson right down the street.

537
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:02,300
I was like, you can't even go to the Lawsons for me?

538
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,260
You- it's five minutes.

539
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:10,320
It's- if I wasn't like, chained to my bathroom, I would go to the Lawson.

540
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:18,100
Like, I couldn't- I was like, I couldn't believe it.

541
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:23,260
I- It's a liability?

542
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,160
If I died in their hotel room, it would have been a liability regardless.

543
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,900
Oh my god.

544
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,840
Anyway, um.

545
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:43,120
I was not- I told you, I was not a bath- I was not like, a person anymore.

546
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,860
They didn't even- I didn't even realize you could make it!

547
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,900
Apparently, you can!

548
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,300
Oh my god.

549
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,720
Oh, I would haunt this hotel.

550
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,940
I would haunt it.

551
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,940
Oh my god.

552
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:07,000
I didn't know they can offer to call a doctor, because they didn't offer it!

553
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:12,240
I- they didn't even- they didn't even offer it!

554
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,560
I didn't realize that was an option!

555
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,280
I didn't realize!

556
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,960
Because I was never offered this option!

557
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:26,980
I- anyway, so like, you know, later on in the night, I was like, oh man, you know what?

558
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,600
Apparently, I should- I really- I should try and get something in my stomach.

559
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,360
And then, um.

560
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,780
Um, and then so I called room service, and I was like, can I have a banana?

561
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,260
Like, I legitimately- That's all.

562
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,480
I was like, I need a banana.

563
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,600
I need something in my stomach.

564
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,260
I- I need something.

565
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,840
And then they're like, okay, we'll get you a banana.

566
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:57,360
And then they called back, and was like, sorry ma'am, we don't have any bananas for room service.

567
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:04,080
Like, we- And I was- they're like, we can't offer you a banana.

568
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,480
I was like, I just wanted one thing.

569
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,040
I- Go- just go to the losses and buy me a banana at that point!

570
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:25,460
Like, just- I just- they're like, we can offer you kiwi, and um, I don't fucking know what the other one- Strawberries.

571
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,360
And I'm like, oh yeah, let me just fucking get an allergic reaction and end this all.

572
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,280
And it-

573
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:38,520
I was just like- I was like, oh my god.

574
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:41,420
They have like, all these cantaloupes.

575
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:47,740
They have cantaloupes, they have kiwis, they have strawberries, but they don't even have a fucking banana.

576
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,280
I was so sad.

577
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:57,160
Oh my god, I was so sad.

578
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,770
Yeah, I toughened it out.

579
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:08,490
I- Um, I like- so like, I had no meds.

580
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:13,590
I had um, luckily I- Pocari Sweat, luckily in my fucking mini bar.

581
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:20,070
I had- I had Pocari Sweat in my fucking mini bar, so there was that.

582
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:31,830
So like, I basically survived my food poisoning with like, Pocari Sweat and water.

583
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:34,930
And then just being chained to my bathroom.

584
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:41,210
I just- I just- I had no medicine, no bananas.

585
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:48,330
I just fucking- I fucking went in I went in the hardest way possible.

586
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:52,690
Oh my god.

587
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:57,010
Anyway, that's how- Wow, what a vacation, Turkey.

588
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:59,350
Oh my god, wow.

589
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:03,930
Oh my god.

590
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:08,150
Yeah, no, I was- I was- It was not okay.

591
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:10,470
I was not okay that day.

592
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:12,150
The day after, I felt a lot better.

593
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:12,570
I don't know.

594
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:18,650
I think I like- because like, I basically like, just went, okay body, give me the worst thing.

595
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:24,030
Give me like, the- Like, just get everything out like, in one day.

596
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,830
Like, I don't- I don't care anymore.

597
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,170
Just get everything out.

598
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,310
And then the next day, I ate carbonara spaghetti.

599
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:34,030
I was like, I'm feeling invincible.

600
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:34,410
Ball!

601
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,590
So, you guys remember that?

602
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:43,090
I literally just went and ate fucking carbonara spaghetti right after.

603
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:49,810
Oh, I have photo of that carbonara spaghetti too.

604
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:51,170
Let me grab it real quick.

605
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:53,270
Let me- Okay, let me see it.

606
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:54,550
Let me grab it.

607
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:58,730
I'll grab my- I didn't- Guys, I need you guys to know, I didn't even edit these photos.

608
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:06,270
I usually put like, filters and stuff to be like, oh, look how pretty the- I don't have time to put filters on these photos.

609
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:12,190
We're going straight into like, unfiltered photos.

610
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:17,750
No like, no like, cute filters to make the colors pop up more.

611
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:25,550
This is basically- This was the pasta I ate post food poisoning, which is the day after.

612
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:39,620
The day after I was throwing up and also other things in the bathroom, I went straight for this pasta.

613
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:46,200
You should- I did and I was okay.

614
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,360
That was so risky.

615
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,720
It's all right.

616
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:54,280
It was- I- It was the risk I was willing to take.

617
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,600
It was- I was like, I was like, I'm ready.

618
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:00,900
I'm ready.

619
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,320
I'm fucking ready.

620
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,520
I already went through so much the last- the last day.

621
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,620
And it worked.

622
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,360
I was okay.

623
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,540
I was okay in the end.

624
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,860
Also, also you guys didn't know, um, uh, Jack, thank you for the super chat.

625
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:16,140
Thank you.

626
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:19,460
How do you not play a tank in Rivals?

627
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,620
Because I already had to tank life.

628
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:27,000
I- I already had to go through life and tank it.

629
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:31,120
Why do I have to put myself through that in the virtual world?

630
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:35,500
And the virtual world is my escape from tanking.

631
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,240
Like, what do you mean?

632
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:41,180
I'm here to escape the- the tanking of life.

633
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,000
I'm not here to fucking do this all over again.

634
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,720
I- Hahahahaha!

635
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:53,780
Uh, all right, anyway, uh...

636
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:59,080
Anyway, oh yeah, speaking of like, Marvel Rivals.

637
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,360
Quick update.

638
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,880
So you know, I've been part of this the VTuber- Now there's a VTuber Marvel Rivals tournament.

639
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:10,240
So, um, we're technically allowed one non-VTuber.

640
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:15,980
So, like obviously and like two GM- like two GM, uh, plus players.

641
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:39,360
So like obviously I'm one of the GM plus players because I'm one above all so the second person I got was super Gomez Because we needed a DPS player and then like Gomez is like, you know known as like one of the best DPS players in the world and so but But Kony's in it too

642
00:42:43,860 --> 00:43:02,380
How the fuck did you get Kony in as a VTuber So Kony is Categorized as a VTuber on my team and you guys want to know how?

643
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:35,080
It's because It's because during the very first SageM Slam He used a Mickey Mouse VTuber VTuber model on stream so it Counted and I asked because the staff was like if as long as he's used a PNT or a VTuber model before 2025 it counts and then I asked Kony,

644
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:45,980
I was like Kony do you want to join this this VTuber Marble Raven Tournament Like this Marble Raven Tournament and Kony was like the VTuber one Oh my god, I'll be so fucking funny

645
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:58,540
Okay, but there is a catch have you ever used a VTuber model and he linked me this video

646
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:40,080
The staff like the staff I was like you said he used it for this is that count and they're like, yes, it's approved So that's that's how that's how Kony is categorized as a VTuber on my team

647
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:52,640
I Asked I asked permission.

648
00:44:52,820 --> 00:45:00,340
It's not like I fucking sneaked in there and be like he VTuber it comes the joy I asked permission.

649
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:07,400
I They said yes, so it's not my fault I

650
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:24,260
Anyway, anyway, anyway, so we're just missing one more tank player for day one I won't say we have a tank player for day two We have to take place for day two.

651
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:30,700
So we just miss but like for day we need one tank player So the rest of my team is okay.

652
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:58,500
So it's me Gomez Kony Shoto and limo and We're just missing one more tank player and We have somebody on day two, but it's not fully confirmed yet so we're just waiting for We're just waiting for like confirmation on their side on whether or not they can they they want to join day two But like they gotta wait for further confirmation Because it's not up to them

653
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:15,040
I Was told that day one's gonna be super easy and in day two is where it was the final so it's where like It's where like things get like actual rough So we just need so many to be there for your temporary sub as day one.

654
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:20,240

Thank you

769
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:35,120
Oh Yeah Here's another and lucky part.

770
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:41,200
So like I forgot about this part of my how lucky I've been this month I forgot to mention this.

771
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:45,000
So, you know on my flight return back to Canada.

772
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:59,320
Um, I have to fly to Tokyo first because there's no direct flight to Canada So I have to fly back to Tokyo first so and then fly straight back to Canada, but the thing is

773
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:15,280
So when I was checking in the lady was like Oh the flight that you're supposed to be on might be delayed So you might not be able to catch your transfer flight in time.

774
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:28,320
I was like, oh no What do we do and she was like I'm gonna put you on the earlier flight though a flight that departs like in 20 minutes like 20 in the 25 minutes.

775
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,820
I was like, okay, that seems right.

776
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:33,040
All right Yeah, that should be good.

777
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:39,840
And then so so, um So, you know, obviously I said, yeah sure.

778
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:59,960
I don't want to miss my transfer and then I Waited and the flight that they put me on Got delayed and the flight I was originally gonna be on didn't get delayed so both flights Boarded at the same time

779
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:42,460
Because the flight I booked they transferred me to earlier got delayed, and then they both arrived at the same time.

780
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:48,740
They both arrived at the same time.

781
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:51,100
And you know what's worse?

782
01:03:51,100 --> 01:04:00,540
I should have checked my flight hours, but when I arrived, I had a 3 plus hour layover.

783
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:08,360
So in my head, I was like, what the fuck did this bitch mean when she said I was gonna miss my transfer?

784
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:15,480
I was like, in what world would I miss my transfer?

785
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:18,380
In what fucking world?

786
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:20,860
I was like...

787
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:29,880
So I just, I waited at the airport for 3 plus hours waiting for my next flight.

788
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:38,820
I was just like, are you, are you fucking kidding me?

789
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,960
I was so, I was so done.

790
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:42,760
I was so fucking done.

791
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:49,180
I was so, I was so, I was so over.

792
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:51,820
Oh my god.

793
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:59,740
Anyways, so yeah, that was, that was basically how, how unlucky I was during that.

794
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:01,840
I'm pretty sure there were more lucky stories.

795
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:12,260
I swear, I was writing this stuff down, and I was like, Jesus fucking Christ, like how, how much worse can it go?

796
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:16,600
Oh my god.

797
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,200
It was like almost 4 hours.

798
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:22,920
It wasn't, it was like a 3 to, it was like 3 hours and like 30 minutes layover.

799
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:25,120
And I was just like, what the fuck do I do?

800
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:27,460
What do I do?

801
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:30,060
I, oh my god.

802
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:34,600
But the fact that she was like, you will miss your transfer if you, you know.

803
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:41,420
I was like, I got there, and I was like waiting almost 4 hours for my next flight.

804
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,700
I'm just like, how would I miss my transfer?

805
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:50,540
How in what, in what world would I consider, be considered missing this goddamn transfer?

806
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:55,360
Oh my god.

807
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:59,720
Okay, yeah, so yeah, that was, that was my flight back.

808
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,840
That was what happens.

809
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,080
In my flight back.

810
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,760
Um, oh yeah, oh yeah, another thing.

811
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:11,600
They gave me the wrong laundry too.

812
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:17,020
Cause like, you know, so my benefits with the suite is, I still have to pay for laundry.

813
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:22,780
But like, they are willing to, um, if you're like a regular fucking person apparently at the hotel.

814
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:27,700
You have a timeline, which is basically like you can't, they won't do your laundry after 10am.

815
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:31,140
So like, I was like, oh, can I hand you my laundry?

816
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:33,140
And then like, you give it back to me the next day.

817
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:34,380
And they're like, yeah, we can do that.

818
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:37,640
Cause they're like, um, at least they gave me that privilege, you know.

819
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:42,160
Cause when I was like a regular person at the hotel, I was like, can you pick up my laundry?

820
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:43,700
And they're like, it's after 10am.

821
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:44,840
I'm sorry, it's closed.

822
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:47,920
But like, you know, after I got the suite, I was like, can you pick up my laundry?

823
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:50,880
And they're like, of course, but we'll only be able to give it back to you tomorrow.

824
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:51,400
Is that okay?

825
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:54,440
And I was like, wow, the difference in like what money saves.

826
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:56,420
Like, wow,

827
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:02,300
that, what a difference.

828
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,020
How they treat you, I guess.

829
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:08,980
And the difference in status.

830
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:19,260
Anyway, um, um, so, so basically, uh, you know, I, I, I gave them my laundry.

831
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:23,880
And then when I got it back, they gave me men's laundry.

832
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:29,060
I was like, I was like, wait, I don't wait.

833
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:29,980
What the fuck?

834
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:31,700
I was like, there's like these like jeans.

835
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:36,900
There's like men jeans and like, um, and there's like, some of them was mine.

836
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,460
Like half the laundry was mine.

837
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:42,120
And then they gave me like men jeans and like pants.

838
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:46,160
And like, I was like, you know what was missing?

839
01:07:46,620 --> 01:07:47,520
My underwear.

840
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:53,760
I was like, where's my underwear?

841
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,060
And like my pants.

842
01:07:56,700 --> 01:08:00,680
I was like, I was like, oh my God.

843
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:03,680
Why do you have men jeans?

844
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:09,980
And I called and I was like, hi, I'm, I'm missing my laundry.

845
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,780
And you gave me wrong laundry.

846
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:16,940
And then like, and then they're like, oh my God, I'm so sorry.

847
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:18,300
Like, and they're like, what are you missing?

848
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:19,900
I was like, my underwear.

849
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:30,780
And then like, and then obviously they gave me my right laundry after that.

850
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:42,560
But I was like, how, how, I'm just one, like, I'm clearly like, like how did you give me a, half my laundry was there.

851
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:44,080
Half of them was there.

852
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:48,150
But then for some reason, like my underwear wasn't.

853
01:08:48,150 --> 01:08:50,570
And I was like, oh my God.

854
01:08:51,730 --> 01:08:53,890
How did they fuck that up?

855
01:08:54,310 --> 01:08:55,370
Oh my God.

856
01:08:55,810 --> 01:08:57,390
Anyway, I got everything back.

857
01:08:57,570 --> 01:09:00,350
Guys, I got, I got everything back.

858
01:09:00,450 --> 01:09:03,150
And then the laundry ladies were like super apologetic.

859
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:05,290
It was like, you got everything?

860
01:09:05,470 --> 01:09:07,410
I was like, yeah, I got, I got everything.

861
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:15,350
Anyway, also like, I feel like it's so, it was so wasteful because they like, they pack every individual clothing.

862
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:18,070
And I like their own little plastic bag.

863
01:09:18,110 --> 01:09:21,030
So like, it just, it felt weird for me.

864
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:24,750
Like every individual clothing was just in within its own little plastic bag.

865
01:09:24,970 --> 01:09:27,130
Like those clear plastic bags and stuff.

866
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:32,650
And, and that's just, you have to like open it and be like, all right, this is mine.

867
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:33,310
All right.

868
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:40,190
So yeah, that was, that was my experience.

869
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:41,290
I don't know.

870
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:42,910
Maybe I have more lucky stories.

871
01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:48,750
But like, it, you know, it was just not going the way of, my year of the snake did not start out that well.

872
01:09:51,570 --> 01:09:53,430
Jane, thank you for the Akasupa.

873
01:09:53,830 --> 01:09:54,750
Thank you, thank you.

874
01:09:55,110 --> 01:09:57,410
Late, late Licey for you.

875
01:09:57,690 --> 01:09:59,770
Snuck this in at work, so I'll watch bot later.

876
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:00,910
Don't tell my boss.

877
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:02,830
Don't worry, snitches get stitches, guys.

878
01:10:02,910 --> 01:10:04,750
We don't, just like how you didn't snitch on me.

879
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:05,350
Okay.

880
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:09,810
Nobody snitched on me to my manager.

881
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:14,750
But then he noticed, he was like, oh, hey, instantly sold out.

882
01:10:14,890 --> 01:10:17,690
And then he was like, but you lowered the price.

883
01:10:19,790 --> 01:10:23,170
I was like, no, it was just fun.

884
01:10:23,330 --> 01:10:25,530
We just thought it was really funny.

885
01:10:26,370 --> 01:10:30,490
We just, we thought, we thought it was really funny.

886
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:37,290
It was like, it was like, oh, hey, congratulations, you sold out, but you lowered the price.

887
01:10:46,030 --> 01:10:49,470
Anyway, um, there's only he he ha ha.

888
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:50,910
It was for the bid.

889
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:53,170
I did.

890
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:56,190
I got him to Celestio, so he's happy now.

891
01:10:57,630 --> 01:10:59,710
I got him to Celestio.

892
01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:01,410
He's less angry at me.

893
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:05,350
Gladstone, thank you for the super chat.

894
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:05,710
Thank you.

895
01:11:05,770 --> 01:11:06,250
Thank you.

896
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:09,250
Doki actually got visited by the bad memes.

897
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:11,470
Thank you for the super chat.

898
01:11:11,610 --> 01:11:12,610
Thank you.

899
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:14,990

Thank you.

901
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:15,790
Thank you.

902
01:11:15,870 --> 01:11:18,010
Chat, she's gonna forget about the cookie cutters.

903
01:11:18,230 --> 01:11:19,330
And that's not true.

904
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:21,190
That's not true.

905
01:11:21,770 --> 01:11:23,410
It's so funny.

906
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:26,090
I want to make Buddha cookies.

907
01:11:27,030 --> 01:11:28,210
It's so cool.

908
01:11:28,570 --> 01:11:29,550
Thank you for the super chat.

909
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:29,890
Thank you.

910
01:11:29,970 --> 01:11:30,490
Thank you.

911
01:11:30,830 --> 01:11:32,190
Manny, did you get, yeah, I got him.

912
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:32,870
Thank you for the super chat.

913
01:11:32,950 --> 01:11:33,150
Thank you.

914
01:11:33,190 --> 01:11:33,610
Thank you.

915
01:11:33,610 --> 01:11:34,190
Alright, let's see.

916
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:35,970
Let me see what other photos I can show you.

917
01:11:36,010 --> 01:11:36,770
I have so many photos.

918
01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:40,490
I'm just, like, thinking about which one to show you guys, like, next.

919
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:45,750
Let's see.

920
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:49,510
Oh, yeah.

921
01:11:49,790 --> 01:11:51,790
They had, like, a live replica.

922
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:56,910
By the way, I'm gonna be checking...

923
01:11:56,910 --> 01:11:59,730
I have the schedule finalized for this week.

924
01:12:00,670 --> 01:12:01,510
But look, look.

925
01:12:01,870 --> 01:12:02,350
Look at that.

926
01:12:02,350 --> 01:12:03,250
The supply bin.

927
01:12:03,390 --> 01:12:05,150
Apparently, you can open them, but I didn't open them.

928
01:12:05,690 --> 01:12:08,930
Because I didn't realize you could open them until I saw a video of it.

929
01:12:09,290 --> 01:12:11,170
But here's the supply bin.

930
01:12:11,710 --> 01:12:12,350
Look at that.

931
01:12:12,650 --> 01:12:14,190
And there's me right there.

932
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:15,010
It was so cool.

933
01:12:15,190 --> 01:12:18,370
Like, the whole fan area was really cool.

934
01:12:19,150 --> 01:12:20,290
Wait, what was I gonna say before?

935
01:12:20,410 --> 01:12:21,010
What was I gonna say?

936
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:22,030
I wanted to say something.

937
01:12:22,210 --> 01:12:22,390
Fuck.

938
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:26,970
There was something I wanted to talk about, but I forgot what it was.

939
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:28,570
What was I talking about before?

940
01:12:28,670 --> 01:12:29,630
The supply bin.

941
01:12:29,930 --> 01:12:30,550
Oh, yeah, Apex.

942
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:32,090
I made the schedule.

943
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:34,070
I made...

944
01:12:34,070 --> 01:12:34,990
I finished the schedule.

945
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:38,210
I just got tired and didn't put it on the graphic.

946
01:12:38,570 --> 01:12:40,690
But tomorrow, we're checking out the new Apex season.

947
01:12:40,810 --> 01:12:42,130
And we're gonna have a member stream, too.

948
01:12:42,730 --> 01:12:44,030
Apparently, if you guys didn't know...

949
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:45,910
I know, it's been a while since I talked about Apex.

950
01:12:46,110 --> 01:12:49,590
Like, because, you know, Apex hasn't been doing so well lately.

951
01:12:52,590 --> 01:12:52,990
But...

952
01:12:53,890 --> 01:12:57,710
Apparently, they changed a lot for the new season.

953
01:12:58,170 --> 01:12:59,530
As in, they removed helmets.

954
01:12:59,530 --> 01:13:02,530
And then they put out, like...

955
01:13:02,530 --> 01:13:05,990
These, like, bins where you can grab guns and attachments.

956
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:11,130
So, yeah, we're gonna be checking out the new seasons and seeing how that's gonna be like.

957
01:13:11,570 --> 01:13:12,590
And then...

958
01:13:13,730 --> 01:13:16,510
This week is Dad's birthday!

959
01:13:17,290 --> 01:13:18,730
Another celebration!

960
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:20,070
I have something planned.

961
01:13:20,490 --> 01:13:23,150
Something special planned for Dad's birthday.

962
01:13:23,630 --> 01:13:25,890
So, Doki Amber Doge birthday.

963
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:28,150
So, the hashtag would be...

964
01:13:29,870 --> 01:13:30,170
HBDAmber2025.

965
01:13:30,730 --> 01:13:31,910
So, yes, it's his birthday!

966
01:13:32,270 --> 01:13:34,350
On February 14th!

967
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:35,970
That's the only thing we're celebrating.

968
01:13:35,990 --> 01:13:37,850
Because that's the most important day.

969
01:13:38,290 --> 01:13:39,830
Guys, nothing else!

970
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:42,070
That's the most important day!

971
01:13:42,290 --> 01:13:43,870
There's nothing else to celebrate!

972
01:13:44,430 --> 01:13:45,750
Because it's his birthday!

973
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:51,890
So, on the 14th.

974
01:13:52,610 --> 01:13:53,750
This week.

975
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:55,470
Nothing else is important!

976
01:13:59,910 --> 01:14:00,390
So...

977
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:01,550
What do you mean?

978
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:02,870
Do you hate Dad?

979
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:04,310
Do you hate him?

980
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:09,850
Do you hate this?

981
01:14:10,010 --> 01:14:10,910
Do you hate him?

982
01:14:11,290 --> 01:14:12,650
Say that to his face!

983
01:14:13,610 --> 01:14:14,570
Right now!

984
01:14:14,770 --> 01:14:14,990
Oh, wait.

985
01:14:15,270 --> 01:14:17,230
Oh, wait, I don't have it on.

986
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:19,070
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

987
01:14:19,070 --> 01:14:19,650
Give me a sec.

988
01:14:19,650 --> 01:14:20,190
Alright.

989
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:23,150
Give me a sec.

990
01:14:23,210 --> 01:14:24,370
I'm gonna bring him over.

991
01:14:24,990 --> 01:14:27,750
I'm gonna bring him over.

992
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:29,570
Just so you can look at his face.

993
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:32,270
And tell me that you hate him.

994
01:14:32,690 --> 01:14:33,970
Alright, alright.

995
01:14:34,530 --> 01:14:36,430
Say that to his face right now!

996
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:37,390
Do you hate him?

997
01:14:38,730 --> 01:14:41,990
The 14th is a very special day for him.

998
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:42,950
Hey, man!

999
01:14:43,370 --> 01:14:45,970
Are you trying to say it's not important?

1000
01:14:46,570 --> 01:14:47,610
The 14th?

1001
01:14:50,610 --> 01:14:51,490
That's right!

1002
01:14:51,690 --> 01:14:53,770
It's a special day!

1003
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:58,530
Thank you for the super chat.

1004
01:14:58,610 --> 01:14:59,350
Thank you, thank you.

1005
01:14:59,490 --> 01:15:00,930
I hate you, Dad!

1006
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:07,450
Thank you for the super chat.

1007
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:08,310
Thank you, thank you.

1008
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:12,090
I'm going on a date with every Dragoon that they've all tried to make.

1009
01:15:12,370 --> 01:15:13,630
Thank you for the super chat.

1010
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:14,570
Thank you, thank you.

1011
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:17,190
MrBrokenBond, thank you for the super chat.

1012
01:15:17,190 --> 01:15:17,990
Thank you, thank you.

1013
01:15:18,030 --> 01:15:19,950
At least I know I'm free that day.

1014
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:21,970
Thank you for the super chat.

1015
01:15:22,470 --> 01:15:23,290
Thank you, thank you.

1016
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:26,790
Dynasty Warriors Origin on Saturday.

1017
01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:27,290
Oh, yeah!

1018
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:30,450
If you are a member, goon.

1019
01:15:31,030 --> 01:15:33,570
The Valentine's...

1020
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:34,050
Sorry.

1021
01:15:34,770 --> 01:15:36,210
What is Valentine's?

1022
01:15:36,890 --> 01:15:37,470
But...

1023
01:15:39,290 --> 01:15:46,270
The February wallpaper is the only way you can celebrate Valentine's Day.

1024
01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:50,550
No, what?

1025
01:15:50,690 --> 01:15:51,930
You mean Dad's birthday?

1026
01:15:52,110 --> 01:15:58,690
Sorry, Dad's birthday wallpaper will be out maybe today or tomorrow.

1027
01:15:58,870 --> 01:16:00,310
It depends if I'm lazy or not.

1028
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:04,630
Anyway, so I sent the...

1029
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:10,370
I have the actual illustration and I sent the concept art of the outfit.

1030
01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:13,270
So, this is my birthday.

1031
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:17,550
This is my birthday outfit for Dad, okay?

1032
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:25,370
So, this would be the member's wallpaper.

1033
01:16:25,690 --> 01:16:26,970
So, if you are a member, goon.

1034
01:16:28,170 --> 01:16:40,030
If you are a member, goon, you will be able to receive the February's wallpaper.

1035
01:16:40,870 --> 01:16:41,310
Yay!

1036
01:16:44,690 --> 01:16:45,130
Yeah.

1037
01:16:46,010 --> 01:16:50,170
So, that's just gonna give you guys the sneak peek for February's wallpaper.

1038
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:55,250
Is that Mint's sock?

1039
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:55,910
Is it actually?

1040
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:58,270
I just let the artists do whatever the fuck they want.

1041
01:16:58,410 --> 01:16:59,790
I was like, you can design the outfit.

1042
01:16:59,930 --> 01:17:01,550
I think it's just subconscious.

1043
01:17:02,490 --> 01:17:04,510
Rio, welcome to the tomato farm!

1044
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:05,470
Welcome, welcome!

1045
01:17:06,010 --> 01:17:07,310
Alright, let me show more photos.

1046
01:17:07,310 --> 01:17:08,330
Let me show you guys.

1047
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:11,450
I have like a lot more photos to show you guys.

1048
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:12,730
Oh yeah, there was like...

1049
01:17:13,190 --> 01:17:14,230
Okay, let me see.

1050
01:17:14,290 --> 01:17:15,910
Oh wait, do I have the photo of the line?

1051
01:17:16,570 --> 01:17:18,770
Wait, I need to show you guys the Timmy line.

1052
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:24,750
I need to show you guys...

1053
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:28,430
Wait, I'm not gonna... I'm gonna be like buffering for a sec cause I need to...

1054
01:17:28,430 --> 01:17:31,370
I need to show you guys how long...

1055
01:17:31,370 --> 01:17:36,750
This is a very important photo cause I think it's fucking hilarious how long the Timmy line was.

1056
01:17:37,090 --> 01:17:37,610
I...

1057
01:17:38,150 --> 01:17:41,830
I was just... I was looking at the Timmy line.

1058
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:43,130
I was taking photos of it.

1059
01:17:43,190 --> 01:17:45,750
I was like, that's a really fucking long line.

1060
01:17:47,970 --> 01:17:49,950
Alright, I think it's this, right?

1061
01:17:50,150 --> 01:17:50,390
Okay.

1062
01:17:52,630 --> 01:17:54,050
Wait, did I send everything?

1063
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:57,750
Or like, something like didn't send... I did, okay.

1064
01:17:58,190 --> 01:17:58,530
Alright.

1065
01:17:59,570 --> 01:18:02,730
Let me make sure like nothing is showing.

1066
01:18:02,910 --> 01:18:06,470
Okay, so like, let me show you the Timmy line and how...

1067
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:13,850
By the way, this photo should have been four sets of photos, but I made it three because I couldn't be bothered to take the fourth part of the line.

1068
01:18:14,050 --> 01:18:15,970
Cause that was... It was a long line.

1069
01:18:16,050 --> 01:18:16,450
It was...

1070
01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:18,410
It was a very, very... I was like...

1071
01:18:18,410 --> 01:18:20,570
The thing is, he wasn't even playing.

1072
01:18:20,830 --> 01:18:21,710
That's the thing.

1073
01:18:21,790 --> 01:18:24,390
He wasn't even like playing in the...

1074
01:18:24,850 --> 01:18:26,430
In the finals.

1075
01:18:26,610 --> 01:18:30,370
But he like went to do like a photo shoot for it.

1076
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:33,190
And I was just like, oh my god.

1077
01:18:34,530 --> 01:18:34,890
Like...

1078
01:18:34,890 --> 01:18:35,930
That was crazy.

1079
01:18:36,090 --> 01:18:38,590
I did not realize how famous he was in Japan.

1080
01:18:38,830 --> 01:18:40,930
I did not realize this.

1081
01:18:41,470 --> 01:18:43,970
I just need you... I just want you guys to see how long this line is.

1082
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:46,290
Like, I'll show you... There's a fourth...

1083
01:18:46,290 --> 01:18:49,230
There should be a fourth set, but I just didn't bother taking the fourth set.

1084
01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:51,130
Thank you for the super chat.

1085
01:18:51,250 --> 01:18:51,910
Thank you, thank you.

1086
01:18:52,350 --> 01:18:53,170
Thanks for the year, Doki.

1087
01:18:53,290 --> 01:18:56,630
My birthday is tomorrow but I'll be working and not able to catch the stream.

1088
01:18:56,990 --> 01:18:57,990
Can I get an early happy birthday?

1089
01:18:57,990 --> 01:18:58,790
Of course!

1090
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:00,790
Happy birthday to you.

1091
01:19:01,010 --> 01:19:02,850
Happy birthday to you.

1092
01:19:03,090 --> 01:19:04,910
Happy birthday dear Deadpool.

1093
01:19:05,410 --> 01:19:06,950
Happy birthday to you.

1094
01:19:07,090 --> 01:19:07,430
Yeah!

1095
01:19:07,730 --> 01:19:08,310
Happy birthday!

1096
01:19:09,930 --> 01:19:11,930
Mr. Stan, thank you for the magenta soup.

1097
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:13,250
Thank you, thank you.

1098
01:19:13,930 --> 01:19:16,230
Dad, here's some cash for you to get fresh treats.

1099
01:19:16,610 --> 01:19:19,670
Just don't tell Doki about what's that supposed to mean.

1100
01:19:20,210 --> 01:19:20,990
Alright, here we go.

1101
01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:22,090
I'll show you guys.

1102
01:19:22,170 --> 01:19:23,330
This is gonna be an adventure.

1103
01:19:23,830 --> 01:19:25,510
So, this is line one.

1104
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:26,750
There he is.

1105
01:19:26,790 --> 01:19:28,230
I sneaked a photo of him.

1106
01:19:28,850 --> 01:19:30,990
I'm not a fucking stalker.

1107
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:31,510
Alright.

1108
01:19:34,690 --> 01:19:34,830
Woah!

1109
01:19:35,410 --> 01:19:35,650
Okay.

1110
01:19:37,130 --> 01:19:39,510
Okay, let me grab...

1111
01:19:40,670 --> 01:19:41,230
Here's...

1112
01:19:41,230 --> 01:19:42,070
Okay.

1113
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:43,810
Here's line two.

1114
01:19:44,590 --> 01:19:47,230
So you can see it starts... There you go.

1115
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:49,770
It starts going... There's the line.

1116
01:19:49,870 --> 01:19:50,870
It's going this way.

1117
01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:53,090
And then let me show you line three.

1118
01:19:55,010 --> 01:19:55,510
Where...

1119
01:19:55,510 --> 01:19:59,690
And then... And then line three.

1120
01:20:00,050 --> 01:20:01,510
This is how far it went.

1121
01:20:01,970 --> 01:20:05,130
There's a fourth part too to this line, but I couldn't be bothered.

1122
01:20:05,230 --> 01:20:05,990
It was just too much.

1123
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:07,510
And there's line...

1124
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:09,530
There's part three of that line.

1125
01:20:09,890 --> 01:20:11,140
So, it was like...

1126
01:20:11,650 --> 01:20:12,730
It was just to meet Timmy.

1127
01:20:12,930 --> 01:20:14,190
It was just...

1128
01:20:16,130 --> 01:20:19,530
It was just... There's a fourth part.

1129
01:20:19,610 --> 01:20:20,930
There was more to this line.

1130
01:20:20,930 --> 01:20:22,190
It was like...

1131
01:20:28,430 --> 01:20:29,870
It went far.

1132
01:20:30,010 --> 01:20:32,210
I was not expecting how far that line was.

1133
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:37,220
Yeah.

1134
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:38,020
And then... Okay.

1135
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:39,600
You want real stalker-ish?

1136
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,860
So you remember how I was like...

1137
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:45,820
To like... Because like Effect wanted to meet up.

1138
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:51,040
And... I wanted to do a little joke where I was like... I meet up with Effect.

1139
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:53,340
And then I don't tell him it's me.

1140
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:54,680
And then I...

1141
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:58,940
Because he was... Him and Alliance were doing an unofficial meet and greet.

1142
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:01,460
And then obviously he gave me the wrong information.

1143
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:02,480
I talked about this before.

1144
01:21:02,740 --> 01:21:04,900
So then I was like...

1145
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:08,320
I legitimately... I gave up because like... This is actual.

1146
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:11,040
I'm not a stalker.

1147
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,120
I swear to God.

1148
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:14,640
I'm not a stalker.

1149
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:17,060
So like... I like gave up.

1150
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:20,340
I gave up and just took a picture of him in the back.

1151
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:21,940
And then sent that to him.

1152
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:23,340
And I walked off.

1153
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:24,920
I was like...

1154
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:26,140
You missed your chance.

1155
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:27,260
And he's like... No!

1156
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:32,540
I love how someone in my chat was like... When the fan...

1157
01:21:32,540 --> 01:21:34,340
When the idol has to...

1158
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:37,160
Can't meet the fan because he's too popular.

1159
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:41,180
So...

1160
01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:43,120
There's him in that blue jacket.

1161
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:44,580
That's him in the blue jacket.

1162
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:46,480
And then... That's a lie.

1163
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,620
Do you see how... Do you see the line?

1164
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:50,040
I was not lining up for that.

1165
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:51,100
I was...

1166
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:54,940
I was not... So that blue jacket...

1167
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:55,560
That's a fact.

1168
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:57,080
And I was not lining up for that.

1169
01:21:57,180 --> 01:21:57,900
I was like... This is...

1170
01:21:58,260 --> 01:21:58,960
It's cold.

1171
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:01,240
It's so fucking cold.

1172
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:02,660
And I was like...

1173
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:04,480
For fuck... And I just literally...

1174
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:05,360
And then I left.

1175
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,560
I left after that.

1176
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:12,700
I'm not a stalker.

1177
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:14,480
I'm not a stalker.

1178
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:16,500
I'm not...

1179
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:18,460
I'm not...

1180
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:20,480
By the way, I'm not lining up.

1181
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:21,120
You're right.

1182
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:24,160
Lining up to meet someone that wants to meet me?

1183
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,920
I am not lining up for that shit.

1184
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:33,320
I'm not...

1185
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:37,260
I'm not lining up for someone that wants to meet me.

1186
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:43,720
But I am not a stalker.

1187
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:45,000
I did.

1188
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:46,920
I just took one...

1189
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,120
I took one photo.

1190
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:51,840
You can't categorize me as a stalker after one photo.

1191
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:59,060
I'll show you guys more aquarium photos.

1192
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:01,940
But I was like...

1193
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:03,360
I felt so...

1194
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:06,520
I wasn't embarrassed at that time.

1195
01:23:06,660 --> 01:23:10,300
But I was a terrorizer at the aquarium because I was so loud.

1196
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:12,380
Because everybody else was quiet.

1197
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:14,840
It was so serene.

1198
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:19,140
They're all enjoying the atmosphere.

1199
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:20,060
And I'll be like...

1200
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:21,060
Oh my god!

1201
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:21,920
Look at you!

1202
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:24,360
Oh my god!

1203
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:25,300
Look at you!

1204
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:26,080
Look at these guys.

1205
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:26,680
Oh my god.

1206
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:27,320
Look at these guys.

1207
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:34,200
I love these guys because it was so funny because you see that guy that shrunk down?

1208
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:37,380
I walked over and then he was like...

1209
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:40,080
He retracted himself.

1210
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:42,140
Sorry.

1211
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:46,140
It happens like that when I get nervous.

1212
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:50,600
So you can see this guy.

1213
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:51,620
His whole head is out.

1214
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,080
And then he walked up and then this tiny guy with a little head up there.

1215
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:55,560
He's like...

1216
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:04,280
I was just like...

1217
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:08,280
It's so cute.

1218
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:11,180
I'm a menace.

1219
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:13,060
I'm a menace to society.

1220
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:14,440
But oh my god.

1221
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:15,360
They were so cute.

1222
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:17,200
And then there was like...

1223
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:23,180
I had my whole nature documentary set where I was just recording.

1224
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,480
I'm doing dumb ass fucking commentary.

1225
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:26,380
Oh yeah!

1226
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:27,540
Let me show you how...

1227
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:27,680
Okay.

1228
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:29,280
Let me see if I can get the video.

1229
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:32,020
Let me see.

1230
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:33,380
You might be hearing...

1231
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:35,360
Let me see.

1232
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:38,420
I just want to show you guys how fucking packed... Okay.

1233
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:38,860
This one.

1234
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,500
This would be a good video to show you guys.

1235
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:41,600
So...

1236
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:42,680
Uh...

1237
01:24:43,940 --> 01:24:44,560
Oh my god.

1238
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:45,840
There was more to this too.

1239
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:46,020
Wait.

1240
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:47,260
Let me find the full video.

1241
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:51,200
I recorded a video where I literally showed the entire stadium.

1242
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:53,280
And... Oh my god.

1243
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:54,060
Did I...

1244
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:54,400
Oh.

1245
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:55,080
There it is.

1246
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:56,000
Oh yeah.

1247
01:24:56,020 --> 01:24:56,660
There it is.

1248
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:56,980
Yeah.

1249
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:58,800
That's how packed it was.

1250
01:24:58,880 --> 01:24:59,100
Okay.

1251
01:24:59,440 --> 01:24:59,840
So...

1252
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,620
Let me download this real quick.

1253
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:04,420
And show you guys how packed the fucking stadium was.

1254
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:05,300
It was actually crazy.

1255
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:07,580
Um... Is this the media?

1256
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:07,820
Okay.

1257
01:25:07,940 --> 01:25:11,600
Do I have a media source that I can use without having to worry about...

1258
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:11,780
No.

1259
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:13,080
I don't know!

1260
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:14,940
I don't have... Okay.

1261
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:15,660
Okay.

1262
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:16,820
It might be really... Okay.

1263
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:18,220
Actually, I'm going to use the music one.

1264
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:19,020
Alright.

1265
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:23,560
I'm going to use the music one because I don't want to blow your ears out here.

1266
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:24,520
Okay.

1267
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:26,140
Uh... Wait.

1268
01:25:26,180 --> 01:25:27,520
Is this the right one that I want to show?

1269
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:28,660
I want to be sure.

1270
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:31,800
Uh...

1271
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:35,080
Let me double check real quick.

1272
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:37,700
That this is the right one I want to show.

1273
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:40,480
Wait.

1274
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:44,890
Oh, you guys hear that?

1275
01:25:44,930 --> 01:25:46,130
I don't even know you guys hear that.

1276
01:25:48,950 --> 01:25:50,370
But look at this.

1277
01:25:50,430 --> 01:25:51,670
Oh my god.

1278
01:25:52,650 --> 01:25:54,170
Oh my god.

1279
01:25:54,270 --> 01:25:55,090
Look at this.

1280
01:25:55,410 --> 01:25:56,410
It's crazy.

1281
01:25:56,690 --> 01:25:59,450
That's how many people there were on the last day.

1282
01:26:00,590 --> 01:26:01,190
Look at that.

1283
01:26:03,430 --> 01:26:05,570
It was literally sold out.

1284
01:26:07,090 --> 01:26:08,450
That was how many...

1285
01:26:08,450 --> 01:26:08,710
Yeah.

1286
01:26:09,010 --> 01:26:10,850
That was how many people there were there.

1287
01:26:11,210 --> 01:26:12,730
It was sold out and everything.

1288
01:26:12,850 --> 01:26:13,590
It was crazy.

1289
01:26:14,710 --> 01:26:16,510
That's why I was like, It's so loud.

1290
01:26:18,630 --> 01:26:20,830
I was like, It's so loud.

1291
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:27,100
It was actually a sold out show.

1292
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:28,880
And then...

1293
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:31,740
And I was just like, It's so loud.

1294
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:37,660
I was not ready for how loud it was.

1295
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:39,300
I was not ready.

1296
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:48,980
But yes, I would have to wear my earphones because of how loud it was in the stadium.

1297
01:26:49,340 --> 01:26:51,060
Just so I could watch it.

1298
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:53,780
Because it was just a lot.

1299
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:55,340
It was so much.

1300
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:56,160
It was too much.

1301
01:26:56,340 --> 01:27:01,460
Let me show you guys where I busted the guy that was on a date.

1302
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:03,500
Remember what I told you guys?

1303
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:04,520
Oh my god.

1304
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:13,340
One of the staff members caught him on a date because I was at a parfait shop!

1305
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:14,860
Wow!

1306
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:17,540
Look at that!

1307
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:26,560
I was eating my parfait when I...

1308
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:30,320
I'm not a stalker!

1309
01:27:31,710 --> 01:27:34,420
I'm not a stalker, okay?

1310
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:35,720
I was literally...

1311
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:37,040
I wanted parfait.

1312
01:27:37,740 --> 01:27:39,780
I just wanted parfait.

1313
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:43,420
That doesn't make me a stalker.

1314
01:27:43,660 --> 01:27:48,300
I just wanted parfait!

1315
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:51,480
Is that too much to ask for?

1316
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:55,440
It's just a coincidence that they were on a date.

1317
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,340
And also, look at these.

1318
01:27:57,540 --> 01:27:58,300
I bought these.

1319
01:27:58,680 --> 01:27:59,940
Aren't these cute?

1320
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:01,720
They're so cute.

1321
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:02,800
Okay, I just realized.

1322
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:07,260
I just realized there was a tiny reflection there, so you're just gonna see the head.

1323
01:28:13,420 --> 01:28:16,740
You're just gonna see the head.

1324
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:22,040
It's a very blurry reflection, but I'm not taking any risk here.

1325
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:25,640
I'm not taking any risk.

1326
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:25,740
Why?

1327
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:27,960
Because I thought it was cute!

1328
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:31,920
Okay, what else?

1329
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:38,560
Oh my god, I want to unpack my suitcase to show you guys stuff I bought, but it's a lot of stuff.

1330
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:40,020
Maybe I'll do it next time.

1331
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:42,060
Maybe I'll do it tomorrow.

1332
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:46,060
Maybe I'll show you guys tomorrow, but there's a lot of stuff I want to show you guys.

1333
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:46,600
Oh!

1334
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:47,060
Oh!

1335
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:47,480
Oh!

1336
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:49,260
Um, so like...

1337
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:50,360
Uh...

1338
01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:53,680
There's something I actually wanted to show a photo of.

1339
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:54,340
Uh...

1340
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:56,760
Let me see if I can find it.

1341
01:28:58,100 --> 01:28:58,540
Uh...

1342
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:00,100
Oh yeah!

1343
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:03,900
Let me see if I can find it real quick.

1344
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:06,380
Uh...

1345
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:07,180
Where is it?

1346
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,280
Oh yeah, also like...

1347
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:10,420
Let me show you guys this photo.

1348
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:12,480
Because I thought it was silly.

1349
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:14,120
I thought it was really silly.

1350
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:18,420
Um...

1351
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:21,220
I drank melon soda in a beer mug.

1352
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:28,720
They just gave me melon soda in a beer mug.

1353
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:30,240
I was like, nice.

1354
01:29:32,620 --> 01:29:34,040
My melon soda.

1355
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,720
I thought it was really cute.

1356
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:41,540
I thought it was really cute.

1357
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:42,940
Um...

1358
01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:44,280
What did I want to show you guys again?

1359
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:45,120
Oh fuck.

1360
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:47,440
What was it?

1361
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,520
Oh no!

1362
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:55,740
I forgot what it was.

1363
01:29:56,020 --> 01:29:56,460
No!

1364
01:29:58,180 --> 01:29:58,700
Ah!

1365
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:00,300
Oh no.

1366
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:01,460
What was it?

1367
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:06,900
I really wanted to show you guys something, but I forgot what it was on my mind.

1368
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:07,960
Ah!

1369
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:10,700
It was on my mind!

1370
01:30:11,980 --> 01:30:13,720
Oh yeah, here's a risky photo again.

1371
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:16,860
Oh my god, fucking...

1372
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:17,800
What was wrong with me?

1373
01:30:17,860 --> 01:30:19,240
What's wrong with you, Doki?

1374
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:21,880
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1375
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:26,840
They'll never know.

1376
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:32,660
They'll never fucking know.

1377
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:34,140
Living on the edge.

1378
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:35,600
Living on the edge.

1379
01:30:40,830 --> 01:30:42,490
How would they know?

1380
01:30:43,010 --> 01:30:44,670
How would they know it's me?

1381
01:30:45,290 --> 01:30:46,490
How would they know?

1382
01:30:47,210 --> 01:30:47,810
There it is.

1383
01:30:48,050 --> 01:30:54,610
The front entrance of the ALGS championship area.

1384
01:30:55,110 --> 01:30:57,490
How would they know?

1385
01:31:00,860 --> 01:31:03,430
The riskiest bird out there.

1386
01:31:04,670 --> 01:31:05,410
Okay, wait, wait.

1387
01:31:05,490 --> 01:31:06,710
I'm going to be buffering for a bit.

1388
01:31:10,130 --> 01:31:20,970
So, if you guys didn't know, players, staff, and coaches at the Sapporo ALGS receive... I didn't take a picture of this because I stole this off of Twitter.

1389
01:31:21,570 --> 01:31:22,590
But I have it.

1390
01:31:23,890 --> 01:31:27,070
So, wait, let me see if I can find a photo.

1391
01:31:27,470 --> 01:31:30,050
Because I stole this off of Twitter and was like, can I get this?

1392
01:31:32,010 --> 01:31:36,930
So, like, this isn't a photo I took of it, but I want to show you guys.

1393
01:31:37,510 --> 01:31:38,850
I want to show it to you guys.

1394
01:31:39,550 --> 01:31:40,670
Oh, this isn't my photo.

1395
01:31:40,790 --> 01:31:42,410
I literally stole this off of the internet.

1396
01:31:46,490 --> 01:31:47,990
Okay, let me see.

1397
01:31:48,210 --> 01:31:49,130
I'm going to...

1398
01:31:49,930 --> 01:31:51,650
save this photo real quick.

1399
01:31:51,850 --> 01:31:53,510
So, it's actually really cool.

1400
01:31:53,650 --> 01:31:57,970
And I thought it was so cool, and that's why I requested if I could have it.

1401
01:31:57,970 --> 01:32:00,530
If I could have one as well as like a souvenir.

1402
01:32:01,470 --> 01:32:08,750
So, let me show this real quick.

1403
01:32:09,230 --> 01:32:13,310
So, this is not my photo, but I stole this off the internet.

1404
01:32:14,550 --> 01:32:23,530
But it's basically the... if you guys don't know, Sapporo slash Hokkaido is known for this specific chocolate treat.

1405
01:32:24,170 --> 01:32:25,930
And it's like the really flat one.

1406
01:32:25,930 --> 01:32:28,710
You know the dark blue packaging one for it?

1407
01:32:28,830 --> 01:32:29,550
You guys know this.

1408
01:32:29,670 --> 01:32:33,510
If you're in Japan, you know exactly what this chocolate brand is.

1409
01:32:33,650 --> 01:32:35,090
And it's like super...

1410
01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:37,810
really famous in Japan.

1411
01:32:38,450 --> 01:32:43,490
And they did a special promotion with Apex and ALGS.

1412
01:32:44,570 --> 01:32:45,010
And...

1413
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:50,130
So, I saw this and I was like...

1414
01:32:50,130 --> 01:32:55,110
So, every player, staff and coach gets this.

1415
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:58,150
So, I heard about it.

1416
01:32:58,330 --> 01:32:59,310
You know, cause I was like...

1417
01:32:59,310 --> 01:33:01,050
Cause players were there early.

1418
01:33:01,270 --> 01:33:05,790
Because they have to like adjust the jet lag and everything.

1419
01:33:06,450 --> 01:33:09,770
And then so, I messaged the Apex staff members...

1420
01:33:09,770 --> 01:33:11,650
And be like, can I get one?

1421
01:33:11,730 --> 01:33:13,110
It's gonna be my first LAN.

1422
01:33:13,410 --> 01:33:14,010
They said no.

1423
01:33:17,410 --> 01:33:18,570
They said...

1424
01:33:18,570 --> 01:33:20,410
They said no.

1425
01:33:20,410 --> 01:33:27,650
And they're like, sorry, this is reserved for the players and the staff and the coaches.

1426
01:33:27,810 --> 01:33:29,250
So I was like, okay.

1427
01:33:29,590 --> 01:33:32,430
They're like, but we hope you enjoy your time at LGS.

1428
01:33:32,490 --> 01:33:34,270
I was like, I guess.

1429
01:33:35,470 --> 01:33:37,250
No, I didn't steal it!

1430
01:33:37,590 --> 01:33:39,950
So, I begged.

1431
01:33:40,050 --> 01:33:41,130
No, I didn't beg, guys.

1432
01:33:41,190 --> 01:33:41,810
I didn't beg.

1433
01:33:41,950 --> 01:33:48,590
I asked if like, you know, with my connections of people that were...

1434
01:33:48,590 --> 01:33:55,910
Of my connections to the players, the staff members, the people who have like, high authority.

1435
01:33:57,390 --> 01:34:01,870
Who may or may not be casting and stuff like that.

1436
01:34:02,130 --> 01:34:05,710
And be like, can you guys get me one of them?

1437
01:34:05,950 --> 01:34:09,910
And then they got me the chocolate bar.

1438
01:34:10,010 --> 01:34:11,990
Like, they got me one of them.

1439
01:34:12,090 --> 01:34:13,610
And I also got an LGS mug.

1440
01:34:20,170 --> 01:34:22,550
So, I got it!

1441
01:34:22,930 --> 01:34:23,950
That's right!

1442
01:34:24,250 --> 01:34:27,280
I got it!

1443
01:34:29,180 --> 01:34:31,300
See me, see this on eBay.

1444
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:34,640
No, I'm not gonna sell it.

1445
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:37,320
I'm pretty sure it could go for like, a lot of money.

1446
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:39,500
Connections, just for fun.

1447
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:45,420
But look, it has... Look at that, it has Apex Legends on it.

1448
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:47,120
Look at that, it's so unique.

1449
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:52,520
It's so unique, it has the Apex Legends on it.

1450
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:53,440
Look at that.

1451
01:34:53,620 --> 01:34:56,580
I also got an ALGS mug too, like for free as well.

1452
01:34:57,420 --> 01:34:58,940
I got it for free!

1453
01:35:04,780 --> 01:35:07,680
So, yeah, I was super happy about it too.

1454
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:08,320
You know what?

1455
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:09,520
No, I... You know what, fuck it.

1456
01:35:09,540 --> 01:35:12,400
I'm gonna get my suitcase in here and start taking pictures.

1457
01:35:12,580 --> 01:35:13,160
Give me a sec.

1458
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:14,260
Guys, you can hear me.

1459
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:16,320
I'm gonna bring my suitcase.

1460
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:18,960
I wanna show you guys some of the stuff I got.

1461
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:19,760
Give me a sec.

1462
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:22,520
Alright, you're just gonna hear me grab my suitcase.

1463
01:35:23,260 --> 01:35:23,660
Alright.

1464
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:25,580
I didn't unpack anything.

1465
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:27,100
I

1466
01:35:37,970 --> 01:35:40,370
have two things that's in front of me that I can show.

1467
01:35:40,850 --> 01:35:41,210
Alright.

1468
01:35:42,170 --> 01:35:42,690
Let's see.

1469
01:35:44,210 --> 01:35:47,510
Oh, I also... Oh my god, I wanna show this!

1470
01:35:48,650 --> 01:35:50,450
Okay, I'll just show you guys this.

1471
01:35:50,610 --> 01:35:51,970
That's all I'm gonna show you guys.

1472
01:35:53,490 --> 01:35:54,490
I gave up.

1473
01:35:54,490 --> 01:35:58,390
I looked in my suitcase and I was like, I have no room.

1474
01:35:59,550 --> 01:36:03,250
I was literally... I was like, I can do this.

1475
01:36:03,510 --> 01:36:07,030
And then I looked at it and I was like, I have no room for this.

1476
01:36:07,290 --> 01:36:08,720
I have no room.

1477
01:36:09,010 --> 01:36:11,910
I have no room to unpack this.

1478
01:36:12,230 --> 01:36:13,410
Okay, I'm gonna be buffering.

1479
01:36:13,550 --> 01:36:14,930
I'll take a picture of what I got.

1480
01:36:16,590 --> 01:36:19,580
Also, I realized I'll have to take pictures and stuff, so...

1481
01:36:21,470 --> 01:36:22,690
I bought this.

1482
01:36:22,690 --> 01:36:25,690
Because, like, okay, I don't know if you guys know about it, but...

1483
01:36:26,710 --> 01:36:30,030
Oh, I can't show you guys the... I'll show you guys the Cappy hat another time.

1484
01:36:30,590 --> 01:36:33,970
I bought a hat that looks like Cappy that basically looks like my hat if you think about it.

1485
01:36:34,270 --> 01:36:36,210
And... Oh, I forgot to send the picture to myself.

1486
01:36:36,570 --> 01:36:38,950
I was like, I took the picture and now I open...

1487
01:36:38,950 --> 01:36:41,910
Now I open the box and I was like, wait, I forgot to...

1488
01:36:41,910 --> 01:36:43,510
I forgot to send this picture.

1489
01:36:45,350 --> 01:36:45,710
Okay.

1490
01:36:47,470 --> 01:36:48,290
Let me see.

1491
01:36:48,930 --> 01:36:49,770
Where's the picture?

1492
01:36:53,810 --> 01:36:56,170
I bought this snack because I thought...

1493
01:36:56,170 --> 01:37:01,850
So you guys didn't know, in Sapporo and Hokkaido, when they're like...

1494
01:37:01,850 --> 01:37:02,990
Oh my gosh, whoops.

1495
01:37:03,990 --> 01:37:05,250
Also, I need to buy a new mousepad.

1496
01:37:05,810 --> 01:37:09,230
My new Artisan mousepad because...

1497
01:37:09,230 --> 01:37:10,810
That shit is getting...

1498
01:37:11,450 --> 01:37:13,370
It's, like, falling apart right now.

1499
01:37:14,650 --> 01:37:16,970
Artisan mousepads, please sponsor me.

1500
01:37:21,010 --> 01:37:21,970
But, like...

1501
01:37:21,970 --> 01:37:23,690
It's not a dick, but...

1502
01:37:23,690 --> 01:37:24,510
That's my phone.

1503
01:37:25,230 --> 01:37:27,030
So, like, I'm gonna open it.

1504
01:37:27,270 --> 01:37:29,410
I'm sad that I'm gonna destroy the packaging.

1505
01:37:29,830 --> 01:37:32,730
But they're known for their little snowbird.

1506
01:37:33,110 --> 01:37:34,650
Like the... I don't know what they're called.

1507
01:37:34,710 --> 01:37:37,290
The little birdies that they have.

1508
01:37:37,610 --> 01:37:38,690
But they're known for it.

1509
01:37:39,050 --> 01:37:39,390
And...

1510
01:37:39,390 --> 01:37:40,470
Yeah, and it's square.

1511
01:37:40,550 --> 01:37:41,450
I might need to see a doctor.

1512
01:37:41,450 --> 01:37:41,550
Okay.

1513
01:37:46,990 --> 01:37:48,410
What the fuck?!

1514
01:37:48,410 --> 01:37:51,830
The ribbon!

1515
01:37:52,890 --> 01:37:53,210
No!

1516
01:37:53,410 --> 01:37:54,610
Oh, wait, that's so cute!

1517
01:37:54,750 --> 01:37:55,610
Oh my god!

1518
01:37:56,110 --> 01:37:57,450
Okay, I got a little sad.

1519
01:37:57,730 --> 01:37:58,770
Because, like, I was like...

1520
01:37:58,770 --> 01:38:00,470
Oh, this packaging is so cute.

1521
01:38:00,530 --> 01:38:01,610
And then I opened it.

1522
01:38:01,690 --> 01:38:02,330
And then I was like...

1523
01:38:02,330 --> 01:38:02,650
No!

1524
01:38:02,950 --> 01:38:04,010
It's just yellow!

1525
01:38:04,510 --> 01:38:06,150
And then I opened the box.

1526
01:38:06,250 --> 01:38:06,530
And I was like...

1527
01:38:06,530 --> 01:38:07,190
Oh, okay, there we go.

1528
01:38:07,230 --> 01:38:07,570
Never mind.

1529
01:38:07,610 --> 01:38:08,010
It's okay.

1530
01:38:08,470 --> 01:38:09,710
But, like, this is what I...

1531
01:38:09,710 --> 01:38:11,010
When I opened it, I was like...

1532
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:11,530
No!

1533
01:38:11,530 --> 01:38:15,070
No, my beautiful packaging!

1534
01:38:18,590 --> 01:38:21,330
But I'll show you why I was, like, a bit sad earlier.

1535
01:38:23,810 --> 01:38:25,090
And I opened the box.

1536
01:38:25,150 --> 01:38:25,390
I was like...

1537
01:38:25,390 --> 01:38:26,590
Okay, I can deal with that.

1538
01:38:28,170 --> 01:38:30,370
Because I wanted to try it out.

1539
01:38:31,150 --> 01:38:31,510
So...

1540
01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:32,570
Oh, wait, did I not save it?

1541
01:38:32,590 --> 01:38:33,490
Oh, I didn't save it.

1542
01:38:35,450 --> 01:38:35,810
Okay.

1543
01:38:36,250 --> 01:38:38,510
So, and then, like, I opened it.

1544
01:38:38,570 --> 01:38:39,330
And then I was like...

1545
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:42,450
No, why is the box just yellow?!

1546
01:38:42,450 --> 01:38:44,630
So, obviously, I was, like, freaking out.

1547
01:38:45,090 --> 01:38:45,630
And I was like...

1548
01:38:45,630 --> 01:38:47,330
Why is the box just yellow?!

1549
01:38:48,930 --> 01:38:52,370
I thought underneath would be the same thing!

1550
01:38:53,390 --> 01:38:54,830
But then I opened the box.

1551
01:38:54,850 --> 01:38:55,770
And then the birds were there.

1552
01:38:55,850 --> 01:38:56,190
And I was like...

1553
01:38:56,190 --> 01:38:57,010
Okay, I'm fine.

1554
01:38:57,190 --> 01:38:57,670
That's okay.

1555
01:38:58,130 --> 01:38:58,610
It's alright.

1556
01:38:58,690 --> 01:38:59,450
I'm okay now.

1557
01:39:04,730 --> 01:39:06,210
I was like...

1558
01:39:06,210 --> 01:39:06,850
It's alright.

1559
01:39:06,930 --> 01:39:07,710
I'm okay now.

1560
01:39:07,710 --> 01:39:08,810
I'm gonna try this out.

1561
01:39:09,230 --> 01:39:10,230
There's this.

1562
01:39:10,750 --> 01:39:11,850
I'm gonna try it.

1563
01:39:12,390 --> 01:39:15,910
Panic cops almost lost my cool there.

1564
01:39:16,070 --> 01:39:16,690
I was like...

1565
01:39:16,690 --> 01:39:16,910
No!

1566
01:39:17,730 --> 01:39:21,870
I literally bought it because the packaging was so cute!

1567
01:39:22,490 --> 01:39:23,850
It was so cute.

1568
01:39:23,910 --> 01:39:24,270
I was like...

1569
01:39:24,270 --> 01:39:25,850
I destroyed it on stream!

1570
01:39:27,570 --> 01:39:30,930
Oh, it's so sad.

1571
01:39:31,230 --> 01:39:31,830
It's so sad.

1572
01:39:37,110 --> 01:39:38,250
It's pretty good.

1573
01:39:38,450 --> 01:39:39,010
I like it.

1574
01:39:41,650 --> 01:39:42,090
Hmm.

1575
01:39:42,870 --> 01:39:45,370
And I bought it for the birds!

1576
01:39:47,190 --> 01:39:49,410
Bought it specifically for the birds.

1577
01:39:51,490 --> 01:39:55,170
I'm sad I didn't buy like a little bird plushie just for like Hokkaido.

1578
01:39:55,530 --> 01:39:57,890
Because like I said, they're like known for...

1579
01:39:58,470 --> 01:39:59,770
They're known for like...

1580
01:39:59,770 --> 01:40:00,970
That's like their bird mascot.

1581
01:40:02,050 --> 01:40:03,570
So I thought it was super cute.

1582
01:40:04,410 --> 01:40:05,050
But yeah.

1583
01:40:05,490 --> 01:40:05,990
You know what?

1584
01:40:06,150 --> 01:40:08,330
I did say I'm not gonna travel for a long time.

1585
01:40:08,330 --> 01:40:11,130
But I think this year I'm definitely gonna go back to Hong Kong.

1586
01:40:11,510 --> 01:40:12,510
At one point.

1587
01:40:12,690 --> 01:40:13,230
Because I really...

1588
01:40:13,230 --> 01:40:13,970
I do miss...

1589
01:40:13,970 --> 01:40:14,990
I miss Hong Kong.

1590
01:40:15,550 --> 01:40:18,730
I miss like eating food there and just exploring the places.

1591
01:40:20,210 --> 01:40:21,130
But I...

1592
01:40:21,130 --> 01:40:22,110
Oh man.

1593
01:40:23,030 --> 01:40:25,470
I won't go there during the fall or the winter.

1594
01:40:25,550 --> 01:40:27,410
I am not going back there in the summer though.

1595
01:40:27,430 --> 01:40:28,010
I'm sorry.

1596
01:40:31,190 --> 01:40:32,090
It's like...

1597
01:40:32,090 --> 01:40:34,190
I'm not going back there during the summer.

1598
01:40:34,310 --> 01:40:37,500
I'm gonna make sure the mosquitoes are fucking dead.

1599
01:40:38,550 --> 01:40:40,250
By the time I go back.

1600
01:40:40,390 --> 01:40:41,390
I need a...

1601
01:40:41,390 --> 01:40:42,610
I need a mixture.

1602
01:40:44,710 --> 01:40:46,730
And those fucking mosquitoes are hibernating.

1603
01:40:46,950 --> 01:40:48,870
I can't go back during the summer.

1604
01:40:51,810 --> 01:40:53,590
How hot does it get there?

1605
01:40:53,870 --> 01:40:55,810
Think hot and then times 10.

1606
01:41:00,790 --> 01:41:01,310
Like...

1607
01:41:01,310 --> 01:41:01,910
So...

1608
01:41:01,910 --> 01:41:04,010
I think that's gonna be my next vacation.

1609
01:41:05,410 --> 01:41:06,590
I'd love to...

1610
01:41:06,590 --> 01:41:08,050
I'd love to go back there.

1611
01:41:08,330 --> 01:41:08,750
This year.

1612
01:41:09,050 --> 01:41:11,730
Because I haven't been back there for like...

1613
01:41:11,730 --> 01:41:12,810
I think like...

1614
01:41:13,410 --> 01:41:14,530
5 plus years.

1615
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:17,410
It's been 5 plus years since I've been back.

1616
01:41:17,610 --> 01:41:18,730
It was pre...

1617
01:41:18,730 --> 01:41:19,790
Pre-COVID.

1618
01:41:20,070 --> 01:41:21,310
And then plus...

1619
01:41:21,310 --> 01:41:22,650
2 to 3 more years.

1620
01:41:22,850 --> 01:41:23,330
I think that...

1621
01:41:23,330 --> 01:41:23,810
Oh my god.

1622
01:41:23,830 --> 01:41:24,790
That's a long time ago.

1623
01:41:25,150 --> 01:41:27,050
I've been back there for a very long time.

1624
01:41:27,790 --> 01:41:28,270
Yeah.

1625
01:41:28,630 --> 01:41:30,550
Like plus 2 years pre-COVID.

1626
01:41:30,770 --> 01:41:31,630
And then 2 years.

1627
01:41:32,050 --> 01:41:33,230
Plus 2 more years.

1628
01:41:33,630 --> 01:41:34,450
So it's been...

1629
01:41:35,090 --> 01:41:38,310
It's been a very very long time since I've been back to Hong Kong.

1630
01:41:38,450 --> 01:41:39,590
So I really would like to go back.

1631
01:41:40,650 --> 01:41:41,930
For a little bit.

1632
01:41:42,070 --> 01:41:42,610
For a vacation.

1633
01:41:43,130 --> 01:41:45,570
But I definitely won't be traveling for a while.

1634
01:41:46,110 --> 01:41:47,190
Because like I said.

1635
01:41:47,310 --> 01:41:48,650
I'm very traveled though.

1636
01:41:48,910 --> 01:41:49,650
I think like...

1637
01:41:49,650 --> 01:41:50,310
This year.

1638
01:41:50,770 --> 01:41:52,890
I've traveled so much.

1639
01:41:53,790 --> 01:41:54,630
This year.

1640
01:41:54,750 --> 01:41:55,290
Like last year.

1641
01:41:55,390 --> 01:41:55,490
Sorry.

1642
01:41:55,770 --> 01:41:59,850
Last year I've definitely traveled more than I expected to.

1643
01:42:00,210 --> 01:42:00,870
Last year.

1644
01:42:01,110 --> 01:42:02,610
So I'm definitely gonna...

1645
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:04,170
I wanna...

1646
01:42:04,170 --> 01:42:06,770
Also I need to recuperate my finances too.

1647
01:42:09,290 --> 01:42:15,630
I need to recuperate my finances after Japan.

1648
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:18,090
Like post-Japan actually fucked me up.

1649
01:42:23,430 --> 01:42:25,810
We're gonna deal with that first.

1650
01:42:30,510 --> 01:42:31,210
Yeah.

1651
01:42:33,010 --> 01:42:34,410
What else did I wanna say?

1652
01:42:35,430 --> 01:42:36,130
Oh my god.

1653
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:36,770
There's something I wanna...

1654
01:42:37,410 --> 01:42:38,730
There's something I really wanna say.

1655
01:42:38,830 --> 01:42:39,570
But I forgot again.

1656
01:42:39,810 --> 01:42:40,090
Ah!

1657
01:42:40,210 --> 01:42:40,890
My brain!

1658
01:42:41,430 --> 01:42:42,330
Oh my god.

1659
01:42:42,450 --> 01:42:42,710
Why?

1660
01:42:43,110 --> 01:42:43,630
I'm...

1661
01:42:43,630 --> 01:42:44,110
Oh my god.

1662
01:42:44,110 --> 01:42:45,050
I'm going to dementia.

1663
01:42:45,770 --> 01:42:46,530
Oh my god.

1664
01:42:46,870 --> 01:42:47,910
Oh no.

1665
01:42:49,470 --> 01:42:50,510
Oh yeah.

1666
01:42:50,790 --> 01:42:51,650
One of my friends.

1667
01:42:51,910 --> 01:42:54,590
One of my friends was thinking about going to...

1668
01:42:55,710 --> 01:42:58,750
Was doing like a cruise to Asia.

1669
01:42:58,990 --> 01:42:59,810
Around Asia.

1670
01:43:01,430 --> 01:43:04,650
And they were asking me about like Hong Kong and stuff.

1671
01:43:04,650 --> 01:43:05,670
They're like...

1672
01:43:05,670 --> 01:43:07,490
Oh man, I really wanna go to Hong Kong and Disneyland.

1673
01:43:07,890 --> 01:43:08,610
And I was like...

1674
01:43:08,610 --> 01:43:10,890
Oh, you're gonna finish it in like less than...

1675
01:43:10,890 --> 01:43:12,870
You're gonna finish it within like...

1676
01:43:12,870 --> 01:43:14,970
I think you can finish it within half a day.

1677
01:43:15,430 --> 01:43:17,030
And then my friend was like...

1678
01:43:17,030 --> 01:43:17,770
There's no way.

1679
01:43:17,830 --> 01:43:18,350
It's Disneyland.

1680
01:43:18,690 --> 01:43:19,070
And I was like...

1681
01:43:19,070 --> 01:43:20,250
No, it's small.

1682
01:43:20,710 --> 01:43:21,870
I was like...

1683
01:43:21,870 --> 01:43:22,730
I was like...

1684
01:43:22,730 --> 01:43:23,950
Oh, you don't understand.

1685
01:43:25,430 --> 01:43:28,690
Hong Kong is all about things being compact and small.

1686
01:43:28,990 --> 01:43:31,810
And Hong Kong Disneyland is small.

1687
01:43:33,930 --> 01:43:34,290
Yeah.

1688
01:43:34,730 --> 01:43:35,970
You can literally...

1689
01:43:35,970 --> 01:43:36,330
For the...

1690
01:43:36,330 --> 01:43:36,770
You might...

1691
01:43:36,770 --> 01:43:44,170
People who might go to Disneyland and other places are not used to the fact of how small Hong Kong Disneyland is.

1692
01:43:44,230 --> 01:43:45,310
I was like, you should go to Ocean Park.

1693
01:43:45,510 --> 01:43:46,130
I was like...

1694
01:43:46,130 --> 01:43:46,870
I straight up told him.

1695
01:43:46,910 --> 01:43:47,670
No, I did.

1696
01:43:47,770 --> 01:43:48,370
I was like...

1697
01:43:48,370 --> 01:43:51,030
No, you should go to Ocean Park if you're gonna wanna go to an amusement park.

1698
01:43:51,110 --> 01:43:52,690
Cause like Ocean Park is a lot bigger.

1699
01:43:53,170 --> 01:43:54,750
And it's also like a lot better.

1700
01:43:54,830 --> 01:43:55,750
And there's pandas too.

1701
01:43:56,430 --> 01:43:57,530
And then so I was like...

1702
01:43:57,530 --> 01:43:58,510
No, you should go to Ocean Park.

1703
01:43:58,570 --> 01:44:00,510
It's actually like a more fun experience.

1704
01:44:00,510 --> 01:44:02,230
Because it's an actual amusement park.

1705
01:44:02,270 --> 01:44:02,950
I'm sorry.

1706
01:44:04,970 --> 01:44:05,490
Like...

1707
01:44:05,490 --> 01:44:08,390
Hong Kong Disneyland is so fucking...

1708
01:44:08,390 --> 01:44:09,130
I remember...

1709
01:44:09,130 --> 01:44:11,970
I can finish Hong Kong Disneyland in four hours.

1710
01:44:13,510 --> 01:44:14,030
Like...

1711
01:44:15,410 --> 01:44:16,930
I was like...

1712
01:44:16,930 --> 01:44:18,110
You can...

1713
01:44:18,110 --> 01:44:18,750
That's...

1714
01:44:18,750 --> 01:44:24,230
You can go from one side to the other side within like 15 minutes.

1715
01:44:24,350 --> 01:44:25,290
I swear to god.

1716
01:44:25,370 --> 01:44:29,610
If you walk from one end of the park to the next, it would take you 15 minutes, guys.

1717
01:44:31,470 --> 01:44:32,890
15 to 20 minutes.

1718
01:44:32,970 --> 01:44:36,730
Just to get from one side to the other.

1719
01:44:37,450 --> 01:44:37,990
And...

1720
01:44:38,930 --> 01:44:39,470
Yeah.

1721
01:44:39,890 --> 01:44:40,530
And then like...

1722
01:44:40,530 --> 01:44:40,970
So I was like...

1723
01:44:40,970 --> 01:44:41,590
But the lines.

1724
01:44:41,790 --> 01:44:43,690
There's fast passes in Hong...

1725
01:44:43,690 --> 01:44:45,110
I don't know if they like changed it.

1726
01:44:45,390 --> 01:44:46,290
But like...

1727
01:44:46,290 --> 01:44:52,590
The fast passes for Hong Kong Disneyland is so fucking fast.

1728
01:44:53,470 --> 01:44:54,010
Like...

1729
01:44:54,010 --> 01:44:55,310
It's so fast.

1730
01:44:55,530 --> 01:44:57,790
Like you don't even have to worry about lines.

1731
01:44:57,790 --> 01:45:01,950
Like you just get the fast pass and you're fucking set to go.

1732
01:45:02,610 --> 01:45:03,090
Like...

1733
01:45:06,310 --> 01:45:08,270
I heard they added a new...

1734
01:45:08,270 --> 01:45:09,790
The new frozen park though.

1735
01:45:09,890 --> 01:45:11,990
So like maybe it's a little bigger now.

1736
01:45:12,050 --> 01:45:13,050
But it's just...

1737
01:45:13,050 --> 01:45:13,790
So like...

1738
01:45:15,430 --> 01:45:16,390
It's like...

1739
01:45:16,390 --> 01:45:17,270
Yeah, so...

1740
01:45:17,270 --> 01:45:17,810
They're like...

1741
01:45:17,810 --> 01:45:18,430
Wait, is it really?

1742
01:45:18,510 --> 01:45:18,850
I was like...

1743
01:45:18,850 --> 01:45:19,110
No.

1744
01:45:19,530 --> 01:45:20,090
I swear.

1745
01:45:20,190 --> 01:45:20,890
If you're gonna...

1746
01:45:20,890 --> 01:45:22,990
Don't plan your whole day around Disneyland.

1747
01:45:23,310 --> 01:45:24,390
You're gonna fit...

1748
01:45:24,390 --> 01:45:25,890
You don't need a...

1749
01:45:25,890 --> 01:45:28,910
You don't need to plan your whole day around that.

1750
01:45:34,170 --> 01:45:35,370
But yeah.

1751
01:45:35,610 --> 01:45:37,370
I wanna go to Shanghai Disneyland.

1752
01:45:37,790 --> 01:45:37,990
Yeah.

1753
01:45:38,170 --> 01:45:39,450
Shanghai Disneyland looks...

1754
01:45:39,450 --> 01:45:40,170
I feel like...

1755
01:45:40,170 --> 01:45:43,850
I feel like Shanghai Disneyland had so many like...

1756
01:45:43,850 --> 01:45:45,130
Cooler upgrades.

1757
01:45:45,250 --> 01:45:47,310
Versus like the Disneyland's around the world.

1758
01:45:47,810 --> 01:45:50,770
Because their animatronics seem like so much like...

1759
01:45:50,770 --> 01:45:52,790
I guess because they're more updated animatronics.

1760
01:45:53,210 --> 01:45:53,890
But I heard...

1761
01:45:53,890 --> 01:45:56,950
I heard Shanghai Disneyland is like really really good as well.

1762
01:45:57,210 --> 01:45:58,230
Also they have more land.

1763
01:45:58,570 --> 01:45:58,790
Like...

1764
01:45:58,790 --> 01:45:59,490
It's not our...

1765
01:45:59,490 --> 01:46:00,990
It's not like Hong Kong's fault.

1766
01:46:01,090 --> 01:46:01,670
You know like...

1767
01:46:01,670 --> 01:46:03,430
We have very limited land.

1768
01:46:04,010 --> 01:46:04,190
Like...

1769
01:46:06,210 --> 01:46:06,690
Like...

1770
01:46:06,690 --> 01:46:09,530
Shanghai has a lot more land for their parks.

1771
01:46:09,730 --> 01:46:10,150
Like...

1772
01:46:10,150 --> 01:46:11,370
Hong Kong Disneyland...

1773
01:46:11,370 --> 01:46:12,150
We're like...

1774
01:46:12,150 --> 01:46:14,190
Struggling to figure out where to put the next thing.

1775
01:46:17,330 --> 01:46:17,810
Yeah.

1776
01:46:18,350 --> 01:46:18,790
Yeah.

1777
01:46:20,810 --> 01:46:21,890
But yeah, that's...

1778
01:46:21,890 --> 01:46:22,950
I guess I'm...

1779
01:46:22,950 --> 01:46:24,270
I think like...

1780
01:46:24,270 --> 01:46:25,910
I would love to go back to Ocean Park though.

1781
01:46:25,950 --> 01:46:27,790
I don't wanna go back to Disneyland again.

1782
01:46:32,050 --> 01:46:33,330
But yeah, I...

1783
01:46:33,330 --> 01:46:36,130
Last time I went to Ocean Park was like...

1784
01:46:36,130 --> 01:46:36,750
For my...

1785
01:46:37,270 --> 01:46:38,730
Birthday when I was really young.

1786
01:46:39,210 --> 01:46:39,570
So...

1787
01:46:39,570 --> 01:46:41,090
I'd love to go back to Ocean Park.

1788
01:46:41,230 --> 01:46:43,590
And honestly, I just wanna go back to Hong Kong for food.

1789
01:46:44,030 --> 01:46:44,390
Like...

1790
01:46:44,390 --> 01:46:46,090
Food and the pop-up shops.

1791
01:46:46,490 --> 01:46:46,910
Oh my god.

1792
01:46:46,990 --> 01:46:48,090
What was that place called?

1793
01:46:48,270 --> 01:46:49,730
This is one of my favorite malls.

1794
01:46:50,270 --> 01:46:51,550
It's like next to the ocean.

1795
01:46:53,950 --> 01:46:55,390
Cause it's like...

1796
01:46:55,390 --> 01:46:55,870
Ginormous.

1797
01:46:55,930 --> 01:46:57,870
And they have like the best pop-up shops.

1798
01:46:58,130 --> 01:46:59,130
Was it Ocean Center?

1799
01:46:59,470 --> 01:47:00,410
Oh my god.

1800
01:47:00,510 --> 01:47:01,170
Wait, is it?

1801
01:47:01,450 --> 01:47:02,470
Is it Ocean Center?

1802
01:47:02,750 --> 01:47:03,450
I don't remember.

1803
01:47:03,630 --> 01:47:05,090
Okay, it's like next to the ocean.

1804
01:47:07,170 --> 01:47:08,150
Wait, is it?

1805
01:47:08,230 --> 01:47:09,750
I don't remember if it is.

1806
01:47:09,910 --> 01:47:10,510
Okay, Hong.

1807
01:47:11,270 --> 01:47:13,870
It's like one of my favorite malls.

1808
01:47:14,330 --> 01:47:15,150
Cause like...

1809
01:47:15,150 --> 01:47:16,790
That's where the giant duck was.

1810
01:47:17,050 --> 01:47:17,470
Like...

1811
01:47:17,470 --> 01:47:19,010
I don't know if anybody remembers.

1812
01:47:19,490 --> 01:47:20,730
But there was a...

1813
01:47:20,730 --> 01:47:21,910
There was like a giant...

1814
01:47:21,910 --> 01:47:24,110
There was at one point in Hong Kong.

1815
01:47:24,250 --> 01:47:26,850
They had a giant fucking inflatable duck.

1816
01:47:27,050 --> 01:47:28,510
Like next to that mall.

1817
01:47:31,450 --> 01:47:32,650
And then it got...

1818
01:47:32,650 --> 01:47:33,350
And then it deflated.

1819
01:47:33,470 --> 01:47:34,170
I don't know if it was...

1820
01:47:34,170 --> 01:47:34,850
I don't remember where.

1821
01:47:35,030 --> 01:47:35,830
Oh, is it Harbor City?

1822
01:47:36,170 --> 01:47:37,110
Oh my god.

1823
01:47:37,130 --> 01:47:38,190
I love Harbor City!

1824
01:47:39,470 --> 01:47:42,990
The Harbor City has some of the best pop-up shops ever.

1825
01:47:43,390 --> 01:47:45,590
Alright, if you guys ever want to tour...

1826
01:47:45,590 --> 01:47:46,730
Like be a tourist.

1827
01:47:47,210 --> 01:47:49,110
And be a tourist in Hong Kong.

1828
01:47:49,550 --> 01:47:51,690
Harbor City is such a great mall.

1829
01:47:51,690 --> 01:47:52,850
Because like...

1830
01:47:52,850 --> 01:47:55,090
They have really cool like pop-up shops too.

1831
01:47:55,530 --> 01:47:57,850
Because at one time they had Neko Atsume.

1832
01:47:58,150 --> 01:47:59,910
Neko Atsume pop-up shop.

1833
01:48:00,770 --> 01:48:01,290
And...

1834
01:48:02,550 --> 01:48:03,590
And like...

1835
01:48:03,590 --> 01:48:05,130
It was like one of my favorite...

1836
01:48:05,130 --> 01:48:07,370
They always have really cool pop-up shops.

1837
01:48:07,690 --> 01:48:08,530
Oh my god.

1838
01:48:08,850 --> 01:48:09,850
Okay, I remember.

1839
01:48:09,950 --> 01:48:11,470
Cause I was like thinking about like...

1840
01:48:11,470 --> 01:48:13,590
I would always go there for like HMV too.

1841
01:48:13,730 --> 01:48:16,790
Cause back then they had a really big HMV store.

1842
01:48:17,170 --> 01:48:17,730
And like...

1843
01:48:17,730 --> 01:48:18,570
Oh my god.

1844
01:48:18,830 --> 01:48:19,610
You know what's funny?

1845
01:48:19,730 --> 01:48:19,990
Okay.

1846
01:48:19,990 --> 01:48:22,010
I was like debating if I should tell this story.

1847
01:48:22,170 --> 01:48:23,150
Because it's like...

1848
01:48:23,150 --> 01:48:24,590
Okay, I just thought it was funny.

1849
01:48:24,730 --> 01:48:25,410
But also like...

1850
01:48:25,410 --> 01:48:25,790
I was like...

1851
01:48:25,790 --> 01:48:27,070
What the fuck is happening?

1852
01:48:27,310 --> 01:48:27,710
Oh my god.

1853
01:48:28,010 --> 01:48:29,430
But I'll tell the story really quick.

1854
01:48:29,630 --> 01:48:30,070
Like...

1855
01:48:30,070 --> 01:48:30,570
This story.

1856
01:48:30,690 --> 01:48:31,890
There's no like...

1857
01:48:31,890 --> 01:48:32,490
Ill-intentions.

1858
01:48:32,530 --> 01:48:33,590
I just thought it was funny.

1859
01:48:33,650 --> 01:48:34,570
Cause I told my friends.

1860
01:48:34,630 --> 01:48:35,010
And they were like...

1861
01:48:35,010 --> 01:48:35,970
What the fuck?

1862
01:48:36,290 --> 01:48:36,730
So...

1863
01:48:36,730 --> 01:48:37,330
I was at...

1864
01:48:37,330 --> 01:48:38,250
When I was in Japan.

1865
01:48:39,250 --> 01:48:39,690
Um...

1866
01:48:39,690 --> 01:48:40,750
I saw...

1867
01:48:40,750 --> 01:48:42,490
I went to the HMV in Japan.

1868
01:48:43,130 --> 01:48:44,150
And then I was like...

1869
01:48:44,530 --> 01:48:46,630
Is that merch of me?

1870
01:48:47,430 --> 01:48:48,590
Obviously not me.

1871
01:48:48,590 --> 01:48:49,770
But like...

1872
01:48:49,770 --> 01:48:49,990
Me?

1873
01:48:50,550 --> 01:48:51,410
I was like...

1874
01:48:51,410 --> 01:48:51,810
It's...

1875
01:48:51,810 --> 01:48:53,370
It's been a year.

1876
01:49:04,740 --> 01:49:06,820
I don't get revenue off of that.

1877
01:49:06,920 --> 01:49:08,460
I don't get any royalties off of that.

1878
01:49:08,540 --> 01:49:09,340
And then I was like...

1879
01:49:09,340 --> 01:49:10,300
And then I told my friends.

1880
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:10,580
I was like...

1881
01:49:10,580 --> 01:49:11,380
Is it pre-owned?

1882
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:11,860
And I was like...

1883
01:49:11,860 --> 01:49:12,640
No, it's new.

1884
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:14,220
And I was like...

1885
01:49:14,220 --> 01:49:15,140
I was like...

1886
01:49:15,140 --> 01:49:16,700
I thought these were sold out.

1887
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:18,640
And they were like...

1888
01:49:18,640 --> 01:49:19,880
I was just like...

1889
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:20,720
I was like...

1890
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:22,160
My friend is like...

1891
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:23,000
Wait, what?

1892
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:23,460
I was like...

1893
01:49:23,460 --> 01:49:23,700
Yes.

1894
01:49:23,700 --> 01:49:26,040
I saw like plushies and everything.

1895
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:27,420
And I was like...

1896
01:49:27,420 --> 01:49:28,480
I was like...

1897
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:29,220
They're like...

1898
01:49:29,220 --> 01:49:30,040
It's been a year.

1899
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:31,340
And I was like...

1900
01:49:31,340 --> 01:49:32,380
I was like...

1901
01:49:32,380 --> 01:49:32,880
No.

1902
01:49:36,220 --> 01:49:38,160
I was so surprised.

1903
01:49:40,120 --> 01:49:43,620
I was not expecting it.

1904
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:47,260
I don't get like...

1905
01:49:47,260 --> 01:49:50,400
I don't get like profit off of that by the way.

1906
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:52,020
Because I got...

1907
01:49:52,020 --> 01:49:52,340
You know.

1908
01:49:57,300 --> 01:49:59,760
So, it was just, it was so funny.

1909
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:02,740
I was like, what the fuck is up?

1910
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:04,980
It was so funny.

1911
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:08,080
I just took a picture of it too.

1912
01:50:08,160 --> 01:50:10,260
I was like, bro, what the fuck, that's me!

1913
01:50:12,100 --> 01:50:13,520
That's me in Japan!

1914
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:17,080
Oh my god.

1915
01:50:18,700 --> 01:50:23,680
Um, um, um, but yeah, I just thought, I just thought it was so funny.

1916
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:26,880
I debated about telling the story, but I was like, fuck it.

1917
01:50:27,240 --> 01:50:30,040
Cause I was thinking, cause I saw this at an HMV too.

1918
01:50:33,180 --> 01:50:41,980
Um, um, no, no, it's an official, they're, they're like, it's not third Friday, they're an official, like they're official seller for the merch.

1919
01:50:42,140 --> 01:50:45,540
So I just, I was like, why am I, oh my god.

1920
01:50:49,340 --> 01:50:51,420
Um, yeah, yeah, anyway.

1921
01:50:51,860 --> 01:50:55,140
But like I said, I would, oh my gosh, there's so many places.

1922
01:50:55,240 --> 01:51:00,200
I'm just like thinking back, there's like so many places I would love to go when I visit Hong Kong again.

1923
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:02,060
But yeah, I wish I could.

1924
01:51:02,540 --> 01:51:04,180
I wish I, oh my gosh.

1925
01:51:04,660 --> 01:51:17,120
The only thing I sort of wish, um, I wish AOGS wasn't around that time, is that I really wanted to go to like a Lunar New Year festival, um, in my city.

1926
01:51:17,260 --> 01:51:35,300
I just, cause like, I think what I missed, oh my god, I missed the lion dances, the, the lion dances and, uh, uh, uh, and like all the, like, just like, you know, just the things you can do during like Lunar New Year festivals.

1927
01:51:35,400 --> 01:51:39,600
And ah, I, I wish, I really, cause I was gonna go to one of them.

1928
01:51:40,060 --> 01:51:45,740
Um, I was gonna go to one of them if AOGS wasn't around that time.

1929
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:51,500
Yeah, I was, I was like, I was like, ah man, and I found it.

1930
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:54,080
I was like, wait, it happens at the same time.

1931
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:56,920
Ah, I couldn't, I couldn't go.

1932
01:51:57,760 --> 01:51:59,980
I was like a little bit upset about that.

1933
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:04,100
Um, but maybe next year, maybe next year.

1934
01:52:04,180 --> 01:52:08,760
Obviously, there's no Lunar New Year festivals right now going on, cause like, I got, I was a little late.

1935
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:16,840
Oh yeah, by the way, um, we are, um, this is for next, uh, well, we're gonna put this up soon when we revamp our store.

1936
01:52:17,240 --> 01:52:28,140
But if you guys didn't know, uh, we have, we're gonna have, obviously, like, you know, Lunar New Year's ending, but like, what's funny is that a lot of the people who receive Lunar New Year merch from last year are getting it before this Lunar New Year.

1937
01:52:28,380 --> 01:52:32,440
But like, if you guys didn't know, we're gonna have new Lunar New Year envelopes.

1938
01:52:32,540 --> 01:52:35,920
We actually have them produced already, so we actually have them on hand.

1939
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:40,300
But I haven't put it up on the store yet, cause we're revamping the store at the moment.

1940
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:45,180
So, um, these are the new envelopes that, uh, we actually have already made.

1941
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:48,520
So like, we actually could be sending them out whenever they're purchased.

1942
01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:54,240
Um, but yes, um, we're gonna have new Lunar New Year envelopes.

1943
01:52:54,640 --> 01:52:58,580
Um, uh, but it's not gonna be, I'm not gonna be selling them this month.

1944
01:52:59,060 --> 01:53:02,820
Um, we're gonna wait until the store gets revamped by our new distributor.

1945
01:53:03,740 --> 01:53:05,320
Uh, so yeah, they're so cute.

1946
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:14,080
I showed these before, but I wanted to show you guys today again because it's, uh, uh, uh, you know, just cause it's Lunar New Year.

1947
01:53:14,780 --> 01:53:16,180
No, the envelopes aren't limited.

1948
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:18,880
Um, we're gonna restock the old envelopes too.

1949
01:53:19,240 --> 01:53:21,440
So the envelopes will not be limited at all.

1950
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:24,380
Uh, Gus, thank you for this Magenta Supa.

1951
01:53:24,500 --> 01:53:25,200
Thank you, thank you.

1952
01:53:25,220 --> 01:53:28,580
It's love hearing you find it funny after one year after that.

1953
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:29,980
Thank you for the Magenta Supa.

1954
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:31,000
Thank you, thank you.

1955
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:32,100
I was just surprised, dude.

1956
01:53:32,220 --> 01:53:35,560
I was like, I was like, you know, after all of that, why would you still sell?

1957
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:37,740
I guess, you know, money.

1958
01:53:40,020 --> 01:53:46,380
Cause like, they still have like stock remaining or some shit, but I was just like, why is it still here?

1959
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:57,180
Like, um, but, um, one of my friends was like, they should have destroyed the stock.

1960
01:53:57,380 --> 01:53:59,020
I was like, I don't know.

1961
01:54:03,420 --> 01:54:05,960
I was like, it seems like a waste, so I get that.

1962
01:54:10,980 --> 01:54:13,520
Um, I just thought it was funny.

1963
01:54:18,020 --> 01:54:20,260
Yeah, no, my friend was like, burn it.

1964
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:22,880
Why didn't they just burn it all?

1965
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:24,360
And I was like, what the, chill.

1966
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:28,040
Just put it in a grinder.

1967
01:54:28,620 --> 01:54:35,940
Like, that would be so, honestly, it would have been very therapeutic if you could just, you know, just grind them up.

1968
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:43,580
But yeah, so yeah, I wish I could show you guys more photos.

1969
01:54:43,820 --> 01:54:44,680
I'm so dumb.

1970
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:49,920
I should have just taken more photos of like, uh, oh yeah.

1971
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:51,040
Oh, I took photos of this.

1972
01:54:51,160 --> 01:54:52,180
Wait, I can show you guys this.

1973
01:54:53,200 --> 01:54:54,240
I can show you guys this.

1974
01:54:54,240 --> 01:55:00,440
So, like, at ALGS, they had a thing where, um, oh, they had Trolloc, yeah.

1975
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:08,000
They had a thing where they actually had, like, um, replicas, life-size replicas of the Heirlooms.

1976
01:55:08,140 --> 01:55:09,940
So, obviously, I took a picture of Mirage.

1977
01:55:11,420 --> 01:55:19,060
So, they had, like, the life-size replicas of all the Heirlooms from Apex Legends, and I thought, that is really neat.

1978
01:55:19,060 --> 01:55:27,640
I took a picture of Mirage because, obviously, I wouldn't... I took a picture of all of them, but then there's reflections, so I was like, I don't know.

1979
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:30,260
I don't know if I was showing those.

1980
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:40,800
But, yeah, it was like, there was a lot of them, too, so I just wanted to show... Oh, yeah, and then there's... Oh, and then there's these guys.

1981
01:55:40,840 --> 01:55:42,820
These guys doing, like, ice sculptures.

1982
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:45,340
I was not stalking them, by the way.

1983
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:46,700
I legitimately... Look at them!

1984
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:48,820
They were doing their ice sculptures.

1985
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:51,600
So, this was pre... before they were finished with them.

1986
01:55:51,760 --> 01:56:00,280
So, if you guys didn't know, Hokkaido is known for their... or Sapporo is known for their, like, ice festivals and, like, ice sculptures.

1987
01:56:00,620 --> 01:56:05,280
And I thought it was really cool to see them, like, actually carve stuff out in ice.

1988
01:56:08,350 --> 01:56:09,430
Really cool.

1989
01:56:09,510 --> 01:56:15,150
I had... It was so cool, like, showing... Like, just seeing them... Why do you keep repeating?

1990
01:56:15,470 --> 01:56:19,030
Because I want you guys to know I'm not a stalker!

1991
01:56:19,210 --> 01:56:24,310
I need you guys to know I'm not a stalker.

1992
01:56:24,990 --> 01:56:33,130
I just... I just wanted to take a picture of them carving out ice sculptures.

1993
01:56:33,410 --> 01:56:35,250
I swear to God.

1994
01:56:35,250 --> 01:56:35,970
Oh, yeah.

1995
01:56:36,950 --> 01:56:46,470
There's a team that won... There's a team that won ALGS and the people are, like, yelling about how, like, they don't deserve to... I don't know.

1996
01:56:46,550 --> 01:56:56,250
The newest, like, drama about Apex is that people are yelling at how they shouldn't have won the LAN thing because the meta was so boring that...

1997
01:56:58,570 --> 01:57:02,790
But, yeah, I thought it was cool because it was, like, little fireworks and stuff.

1998
01:57:03,870 --> 01:57:04,590
Who won?

1999
01:57:04,730 --> 01:57:05,370
Go next.

2000
01:57:05,550 --> 01:57:07,250
And then you guys are, like, who exactly?

2001
01:57:16,570 --> 01:57:18,510
If you're, like, who exactly?

2002
01:57:18,670 --> 01:57:20,870
And that's why there's drama right now.

2003
01:57:20,870 --> 01:57:22,450
But why?

2004
01:57:22,690 --> 01:57:24,070
Why did they win?

2005
01:57:29,230 --> 01:57:30,650
But I thought it was cool.

2006
01:57:30,790 --> 01:57:32,470
And then let's see what our photos did.

2007
01:57:32,630 --> 01:57:33,130
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2008
01:57:33,250 --> 01:57:34,010
I'll show you guys.

2009
01:57:37,310 --> 01:57:40,550
Here's another... Here's another living on the edge photo.

2010
01:57:40,990 --> 01:57:42,090
Wait, did I not save it?

2011
01:57:42,670 --> 01:57:43,650
Wait, did I not save it?

2012
01:57:43,670 --> 01:57:44,850
Where's the... Oh, there it is.

2013
01:57:44,850 --> 01:57:45,890
Here's another one.

2014
01:57:46,010 --> 01:57:47,410
I always... I use a dragoon.

2015
01:57:48,030 --> 01:57:58,510
I always use a dragoon for these photos because, like, I feel like if I use, like, anything else that's not a dragoon, then, like, that's way too risky.

2016
01:57:58,670 --> 01:58:03,650
Like, at least a dragoon, people would just think, like, oh, you know, like, it's just a bird, you know?

2017
01:58:06,690 --> 01:58:10,430
I was just like, like, it's less obvious.

2018
01:58:10,810 --> 01:58:13,570
It's less obvious when I'm in the public, okay?

2019
01:58:14,110 --> 01:58:19,870
So that's what I mean, like, yeah, like, it's just... They'll just think it's, like, a yellow bird.

2020
01:58:19,870 --> 01:58:25,710
And so then I... So I was just like, yeah, so this was the ending of the tournament.

2021
01:58:26,590 --> 01:58:39,730
This was the ending of the tournament, and so it was, like, I just took a picture and was like, whoa, there you guys are.

2022
01:58:40,090 --> 01:58:40,890
There you guys are.

2023
01:58:40,890 --> 01:58:44,950
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2024
01:58:46,830 --> 01:58:48,470
Seek help, Doki!

2025
01:58:49,550 --> 01:58:50,810
I don't need help!

2026
01:58:51,150 --> 01:58:52,630
I don't need a therapist!

2027
01:58:53,130 --> 01:58:53,730
Oh, no, okay.

2028
01:58:55,570 --> 01:58:56,710
Thank you for the superchat.

2029
01:58:56,810 --> 01:58:57,630
Thank you, thank you.

2030
01:58:57,990 --> 01:58:59,310
Liz, thank you for the superchat.

2031
01:58:59,490 --> 01:58:59,610
No!

2032
01:59:02,270 --> 01:59:04,090
How did you lose it?

2033
01:59:04,310 --> 01:59:05,410
Like, wait, what?

2034
01:59:05,990 --> 01:59:07,050
Asahi, I win you.

2035
01:59:07,130 --> 01:59:08,670
You deserve to know what happened.

2036
01:59:08,790 --> 01:59:10,950
Wait, how did you lose it?

2037
01:59:11,190 --> 01:59:12,430
How is that possible?

2038
01:59:13,070 --> 01:59:14,270
Thank you for the superchat.

2039
01:59:14,370 --> 01:59:15,390
Thank you, thank you.

2040
01:59:15,650 --> 01:59:16,570
Wait a minute.

2041
01:59:17,250 --> 01:59:18,450
Wait, explain.

2042
01:59:22,650 --> 01:59:23,210
Explain.

2043
01:59:23,950 --> 01:59:26,850
How could that... How could they have lost it?

2044
01:59:29,790 --> 01:59:31,950
We need to know the story.

2045
01:59:32,450 --> 01:59:33,770
We need to know.

2046
01:59:33,770 --> 01:59:34,530
Oh, no!

2047
01:59:34,930 --> 01:59:36,830
My buff teddy bear!

2048
01:59:38,490 --> 01:59:41,690
Did you report it to the cops?

2049
01:59:44,390 --> 01:59:47,270
Oh, my God.

2050
01:59:47,570 --> 01:59:48,970
Did the police know?

2051
01:59:51,070 --> 01:59:53,190
How could this have happened?

2052
01:59:54,310 --> 01:59:56,350
Somebody called 911!

2053
01:59:59,490 --> 02:00:01,450
Thank you for the superchat.

2054
02:00:01,630 --> 02:00:02,910
Thank you, thank you.

2055
02:00:02,910 --> 02:00:07,930
Liz, we gotta report a missing... We gotta file a missing person report!

2056
02:00:08,390 --> 02:00:09,330
This is important.

2057
02:00:09,770 --> 02:00:13,130
This is about how do I file a missing person report.

2058
02:00:17,790 --> 02:00:18,310
Okay.

2059
02:00:20,330 --> 02:00:20,850
Alright.

2060
02:00:21,610 --> 02:00:24,110
Yeah, how do you lose a 15-inch slushie?

2061
02:00:24,790 --> 02:00:27,130
I know, that's what I was thinking, too.

2062
02:00:27,450 --> 02:00:28,590
How do you lose that?

2063
02:00:28,630 --> 02:00:29,970
He's a fucking tank.

2064
02:00:29,970 --> 02:00:32,290
He's a fucking tank!

2065
02:00:32,890 --> 02:00:35,830
He's bigger than my cat robot, Fuddly!

2066
02:00:36,170 --> 02:00:37,250
Where is he?

2067
02:00:38,550 --> 02:00:40,170
Bring him home.

2068
02:00:40,390 --> 02:00:42,070
Guys, we gotta start a hashtag.

2069
02:00:42,590 --> 02:00:43,530
Bring him home.

2070
02:00:47,590 --> 02:00:48,870
Oh, my God.

2071
02:00:49,090 --> 02:00:51,390
This is like a national emergency now.

2072
02:00:53,750 --> 02:00:54,430
Alright.

2073
02:00:55,190 --> 02:00:55,590

02:00:56,430 --> 02:00:57,170
Oh, my God.

Anyway, guys, I'm gonna call it here.

Posture check.

2089
02:01:27,530 --> 02:01:29,190
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2090
02:01:29,190 --> 02:01:32,710
And if you stay up for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.
