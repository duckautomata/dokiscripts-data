1
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,880
Hello, hello, everybody.

2
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,080
Hello, hello.

3
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:58,940
I hope my sound guy is here today because I forgot to save the sound settings for this game.

4
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:04,420
So, I hope you're here because we got to figure that out later.

5
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,680
Hello, everybody.

6
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,840
I am currently... Oh, my gosh.

7
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,140
Like, last... Yesterday, I, like, passed the fuck out yesterday.

8
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,680
Because, like, you guys know, like, yesterday I had to wake up really early because of the cleaning and everything.

9
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,200
So, like, all right.

10
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,580
Here's the bad news.

11
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,040
So, she did a great job, you know.

12
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:32,060
But then, like, later on, later on at night, when I had to stay up because I wanted to go to sleep, like, instantly.

13
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,840
But I couldn't because I had a lot of work to do.

14
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,220
So, then I was like, okay, I'll just stay up until it's medicine time.

15
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:37,900
We're dead.

16
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,120
And then I realized I was like, wait.

17
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,060
First off, where's the syringe?

18
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,440
And also, where is the pill cutter?

19
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,920
So, I had a syringe on my desk.

20
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,920
It's just liquid syringe.

21
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,040
It's not, like, a needle or anything.

22
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,140
It's just there for the liquid, like, syringe for, like, liquid and stuff.

23
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:05,300
So, but it has... It's marked on how much I need to give him exactly for his, like, the liquid medication.

24
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,200
So, I was like, huh.

25
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,280
Huh.

26
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,080
That's weird.

27
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,900
Where is it?

28
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,680
So, I was like, oh, maybe she just, you know, put it in the medicine cabinet.

29
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,740
So, I, you know, I, like, fucking...

30
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,140
Basically, I, like, looked everywhere.

31
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,960
All the cabinets I was trying to find where the fuck the syringe was.

32
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,220
And I was like, oh, the pill cutter is also missing.

33
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,480
Where the fuck's the pill cutter?

34
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,620
And then, like, I texted...

35
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,320
I texted the cleaners.

36
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,940
And I was like, yeah, no, she did a great...

37
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,520
Because I didn't want them to, like, you know...

38
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,660
I feel like they're going to be, like, really harsh on her.

39
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,000
Like, that was, like, my last resort.

40
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,920
Because I knew, like, the moment I texted the management...

41
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,000
That they're going to be, like...

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,960
They're going to be, like, really harsh on the cleaner about it.

43
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,340
Because, like, I had a feeling she threw it away.

44
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,680
But that was, like, my last...

45
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,080
But I had, like, a single hope that she didn't.

46
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,700
Because I didn't really want to look through the garbage, so I don't know.

47
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:13,260
So I was just like, okay, I'm gonna text him, just to be sure if she really did throw it away.

48
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,740
Because that is my last resort.

49
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:24,140
Because I really, really, really, really, really did not want to dig through trash.

50
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,140
Is my foreshadowing subtle enough, guys?

51
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,960
A very subtle foreshadowing there.

52
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,480
Anyway, so I texted, and then I was like, no, she did a great job.

53
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:50,980
It's just that, you know, I'm sort of missing his, like, my dog's equipment for his medicine.

54
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,440
And, like, I'm missing the syringe and his pill cutters.

55
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,740
So at first they were like, oh, maybe check the cabinets.

56
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,040
I was like, no, I...

57
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,320
I sort of checked the cabinets, like, three separate times.

58
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,300
And it's not, it's not in there.

59
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:10,040
And then the client, and then they texted back, was like, oh, we sort of, we talked to the cleaner.

60
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,980
And, like, she thought it was an unusable, reusable syringe.

61
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,460
You know, like, there was, like, one-time use because it was just on my desk.

62
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,720
And so she threw it in the trash.

63
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,580
I was like, and they were like, oh, and the pill cutter is, like, under your desk.

64
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,760
Well, that's a lie.

65
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,320
The pill cutter was not under my desk, by the way, because I looked there and it wasn't there.

66
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,120
But, like, that's okay.

67
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,220
I could use the scissors.

68
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,500
I could cut it with scissors and a knife.

69
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,860
But, like, you know, the pill cutter was just easier.

70
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,320
It was just, you know, more precise.

71
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,320
Instead of, you know, grabbing some scissors and going, I just, and it was free, too, from the hospital.

72
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,900
But, yeah, anyway.

73
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,660
So, I was like, okay.

74
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:04,160
So, I got, I got a face mask and I, I dug through the trash.

75
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:14,680
And it was not the best feeling because she also used the trash bag to dump out, you know, the vacuum stuff and everything.

76
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,700
I, I tried to find gloves, too.

77
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:23,180
Because, like, I knew there was some form of liquid in that trash bag.

78
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:29,740
Because I, you know, I, I, like, that's where my, like, leftover, I put my leftovers in there, too.

79
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:35,500
So, I was just like, I didn't, could not find gloves.

80
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,660
Let me just say, I did not find gloves.

81
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:48,200
So, but, and then I found, I dug through, I got another trash bag.

82
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,300
And then I put, I, because I didn't think I was gonna go through trash!

83
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,200
I never thought I would have to look through trash!

84
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,120
Guys!

85
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,100
I, I, I, I, this was the very first time!

86
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,260
I have to go through trash!

87
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:12,640
I, I, I never thought I would have to come to this!

88
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,480
I, I never thought!

89
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,960
Many thinking with super chat!

90
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:17,320
Thank you!

91
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,000
Thank you!

92
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,580
That's primechocojuicedoki!

93
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,480
Anyway, anyway, so...

94
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:28,060
I went through the trash bags, and...

95
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,200
There wasn't liquid yet.

96
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,800
And I was like, oh, thank God.

97
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,020
I didn't have to worry about that.

98
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,520
But do you remember what I said?

99
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,660
I was pretty sure there was liquid in there.

100
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,380
Found out later on that there was.

101
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,700
Because as I was digging through it, I was like, I got deeper into the trash bag.

102
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,460
I found the syringe.

103
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:55,780
And it was, it was, like, covered in some weird orange sauce.

104
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,360
And I was like...

105
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,150
And I was like, this is my life now.

106
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,710
This is my life.

107
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,080
Anyway, I had clean, I cleaned the syringe.

108
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,320
I soaked it up.

109
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,440
I let it dry and everything.

110
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,920
I did all...

111
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,100
I'm like, I did all of this for you, Dad.

112
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,080
I did all of this for you.

113
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,160
For you, you little shit.

114
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:29,960
Like...

115
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,460
The things I do for my dog.

116
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,700
For my fucking dog.

117
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,260
He's like, for me?

118
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,460
By the way, I was doing sing.

119
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,000
Speaking of my dog.

120
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,620
Um, I was doing sing practice, like, two days ago.

121
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,760
And he was, like, sleeping by my side.

122
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,580
And the moment I practiced singing, he, like, left my room.

123
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,500
And...

124
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:08,220
And then, you know, at first I thought, like, you know, oh, maybe, maybe I was just too loud, you know?

125
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,980
And then he just doesn't, wasn't enjoying how, because he wanted to sleep and stuff.

126
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,200
But, like, you know, sometimes, he doesn't do that when I stream.

127
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,760
So...

128
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,580
Like, he's still...

129
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,880
He's still here.

130
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,200
So then I was like, okay, let me...

131
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,320
Okay, so I was like, okay, let me try this again.

132
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,440
And then, you know, he came...

133
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,660
When he realized I stopped singing, he, like, came back into my room.

134
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,960
And, like, went back to the bed in my room.

135
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,760
And...

136
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,660
I don't think...

137
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,660
And then...

138
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:46,440
And then, you know, I was like, okay, oh, I gotta start singing this again.

139
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,160
Like, I...

140
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,460
I...

141
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,340
I have my rest.

142
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,520
I gotta practice again.

143
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,060
I tried it again.

144
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,180
And then he...

145
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,440
He walked out again.

146
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,100
So now I'm scared.

147
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,120
So...

148
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,300
Now I'm not confident anymore about it.

149
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,940
That has had it in the...

150
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,940
Doki, no!

151
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,920
But, yeah.

152
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,920
So I found out my dog does not like it when I sing.

153
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,940
He's just like, alright, time to leave.

154
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,820
Time to sleep outside.

155
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:23,900
Bye.

156
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,620
Alright, let me see if I open the door.

157
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,900
He'll, like, run away.

158
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:30,960
Because when I...

159
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,620
When I'm streaming.

160
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:32,600
No!

161
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:32,920
See?

162
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,860
He's staying here.

163
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,380
I had the door closed.

164
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,040
So I wasn't sure if he's gonna leave because I started streaming.

165
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,260
Um...

166
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,740
But yeah, Gus, thank you for the super chat.

167
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,480
Thank you, thank you.

168
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,900
Not to make you paranoid, but for the love of God, never put your bare hands in trash again.

169
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,580
Use glove.

170
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,060
Oh, no.

171
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,640
I know there's nothing sharp in there.

172
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,340
I know.

173
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,200
I mean, I was the one that threw the trash.

174
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,240
I know because, like, um, I barely own anything sharp at all.

175
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,840
So, like, um, not because I'm a child or anything.

176
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,860
Not because, like, I child-proofed for myself or anything.

177
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,340
But, like, I knew there wasn't anything sharp in there.

178
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,440
Um, I'm thinking for the super chat, Gus.

179
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,480
Thank you, thank you.

180
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,100
I also couldn't find any gloves at that point.

181
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,580
But, like, I instantly washed my hands after I was done looking through the trash.

182
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,220
Papa, thank you for the super chat.

183
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,180
Thank you, thank you.

184
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:24,800
Um...

185
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,340
Uh...

186
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:25,900
What else?

187
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,020
What else do I have to update you guys?

188
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,500
Oh, yeah.

189
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,080
Before, this was, like, unrelated to my life, but I thought it was really funny.

190
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:36,660
But this is spoiler alert for, like, the ending for Renta Girlfriend.

191
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:37,820
But...

192
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,260
Renta Girlfriend apparently finally ended today or, like, yesterday.

193
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,040
And, like, the girl rejected him.

194
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,420
I don't keep...

195
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,260
I don't keep up with Renta Girlfriend.

196
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,680
Um...

197
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,460
And...

198
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,120
And...

199
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,260
Oh, it didn't end yet?

200
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:57,620
Okay.

201
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,440
Because people were, like, thinking that it ended.

202
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,220
Like, some people...

203
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:00,640
I don't know.

204
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,100
There was, like...

205
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,600
Nobody knows if it ended or not.

206
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,460
Um...

207
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:03,780
But, yeah.

208
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:04,500
So...

209
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,240
It got leaked, apparently.

210
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,380
Um...

211
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,900
Oh, the author's gonna make a sequel.

212
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,760
Oh, but they still ended the main story with her rejecting him.

213
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,600
So, I don't really...

214
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,640
I don't ever watch or, like, read Renta Girlfriend.

215
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,720
But I have, like, friends that tell me how shit...

216
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,160
How shit the series is.

217
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,620
And how absolutely terrible it is.

218
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,500
And...

219
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,460
But, like, the artwork's really pretty, apparently.

220
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,480
Um...

221
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,780
The artwork's really pretty.

222
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,000
But the writing is, like, pretty ass.

223
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:35,780
Anyway.

224
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,580
So...

225
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,600
Apparently...

226
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,840
The fandom's fucking hilarious.

227
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,620
From what I've heard.

228
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:42,540
Uh...

229
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:42,920
But...

230
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,340
Anyway.

231
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,560
So...

232
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,220
Um...

233
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,400
The last chapter, apparently, got leaked.

234
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,220
And then, um...

235
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,280
She was like...

236
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:50,680
Sorry.

237
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,740
I picked my career of being a rentable girlfriend over dating you!

238
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:55,820
No!

239
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,080
Ahahaha!

240
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:58,160
Ahahaha!

241
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,160
Ahahaha!

242
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,860
And then someone was like...

243
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,420
Bro, that guy spent $250,000 on her.

244
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,380
And...

245
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:05,940
Ahahaha!

246
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,860
And she's still...

247
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,900
Holy fuck!

248
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:09,700
Ah...

249
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,460
That's crazy!

250
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,800
Apparently, somebody calculated...

251
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,220
How much...

252
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:14,780
Um...

253
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,380
How much he has spent on her.

254
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,240
And it was like $250,000 US dollars.

255
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,400
And then...

256
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:20,660
Like...

257
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,820
And then she picked her career over him.

258
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,660
And by the way, the career is being a rentable girlfriend!

259
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,720
Ahahaha!

260
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:29,900
Ahahaha!

261
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,100
Ahahaha!

262
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,420
Ahahaha!

263
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:33,610
Ahahaha!

264
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,130
Oh my god!

265
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:35,630
Oh my...

266
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,010
I...

267
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,450
I thought that was like...

268
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:38,250
Oh!

269
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,070
I was like...

270
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,170
She's like, I'm sorry!

271
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,330
I'm so sorry!

272
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,150
And I'm like, are you though?

273
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,530
Are you actually sorry?

274
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:47,830
Holy fuck!

275
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,470
I was reading the replies!

276
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,410
And they're like...

277
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,870
Thank fucking god it's over!

278
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:53,850
I...

279
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:54,190
Ahahaha!

280
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,010
They were like...

281
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:57,710
Thank god!

282
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,490
The evil has finally been defeated!

283
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,810
It's over now!

284
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:03,610
Ahahaha!

285
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:07,510
Um...

286
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:07,830
Um...

287
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:08,390
I just...

288
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:08,790
Yeah...

289
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,210
But yeah...

290
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,070
For those who aren't...

291
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,330
Sorry if I spoiled you guys about rent-a-girlfriend!

292
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,130
But like...

293
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,130
I feel like you guys could've...

294
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,430
Sort of seen...

295
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:16,690
Yeah...

296
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:20,530
I feel like at that point if you read up to there thinking that they're gonna get together...

297
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:20,970
Like...

298
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:21,350
Like...

299
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:24,610
I think at that point you've like Stockholm Syndrome'd yourself...

300
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,350
Into thinking that that was the endgame!

301
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:28,290
Hahahaha!

302
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,150
Um...

303
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,070
Anyway...

304
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:31,630
Um...

305
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:34,130
That manga deserves to be spoiled!

306
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:35,930
Uh...

307
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:36,370
Anton!

308
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,450
Thank you for the super chat!

309
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,230
Thank you thank you!

310
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,470
Money ain't got no soul!

311
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,690
Money ain't got no heart!

312
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,510
All you need is some self-control!

313
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,350
Make yourself a brand new star!

314
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,510
Mama Oni...

315
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,130
The princess and the frog!

316
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:48,870
Um...

317
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,110
Manny, thank you for the super chat!

318
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:50,410
Thank you!

319
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:50,950
Thank you!

320
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,530
Imagine doing that money- Much money on a girl!

321
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,650
Anyway, here's 5 dollars!

322
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,650
Mr.Brokenbond...

323
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,170
Thank you for the super chat!

324
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:58,490
Thank you!

325
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:58,970
Thank you!

326
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,970
She got her back and played him like a fiddle!

327
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,150
Thank you for the super chat!

328
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:03,510
Thank you!

329
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,070
Thank you!

330
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:04,590
Alright!

331
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:04,970
Anyway!

332
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,670
But, that's all the life updates for today.

333
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,310
Um, but yeah, I ordered...

334
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:14,170
Before I started to stream, I literally got my food like 15 minutes before I started my stream.

335
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,650
So I was like chowing that shit down.

336
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:19,590
Because I really, really wanted to order some coffee.

337
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,410
Because I was so fucking tired.

338
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:22,590
So yeah, I started that story.

339
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,870
But the reason why, I slept like 11 hours last night.

340
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,750
Because of how fucking tired I was yesterday.

341
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,090
Because of all the stuff I had to do.

342
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,270
And also like digging through trash really took up a lot for me.

343
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,450
So I went to bed at like 9pm.

344
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:38,690
And I woke up at around like...

345
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,610
Um, I think...

346
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,030
Like, I don't know.

347
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:40,710
I just remember...

348
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,090
I...

349
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,290
I slept for like 11 plus hours.

350
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,810
I was so fucking exhausted.

351
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:48,030
But then like later today, like two hours ago, I was still...

352
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,850
I got really tired.

353
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,450
I got... I was still really tired.

354
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:54,750
So I ordered a dripped coffee with an espresso shot.

355
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:55,710
So...

356
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,190
So I might not be okay.

357
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:04,050
That's why I have a lot of energy right now.

358
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,190
It literally has one shot of espresso.

359
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,950
And it's a dripped coffee.

360
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:08,770
So you know like...

361
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:09,930
You know like the slow drip coffee?

362
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,370
That's when you know it's pure fucking caffeine.

363
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,570
Because I am so tired.

364
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:17,870
So...

365
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:20,810
Uh...

366
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,290
But yeah, that's clear.

367
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,070
That's all the life update there is.

368
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,890
But yes, are my sound guys...

369
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,470
Is my sound guy here today?

370
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,630
Because I don't remember...

371
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,030
What the sound balancing is for this game.

372
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:35,370
Because I forgot to save the settings for it.

373
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,030
So, yeah.

374
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,830
Let me know if you're here.

375
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,350
So you can save the stream.

376
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,370
Gus, thank you for the Akasupa.

377
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:47,530
Thank you, thank you.

378
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,150
GamePone when trying to fight for that victory, yeah?

379
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,890
Maybe they are better than you.

380
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,330
Or maybe they have a better monitor.

381
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,510
Doki and MSI can help you with one of those.

382
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:59,190
Link in the description below.

383
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:00,810
Thank you for the Akasupa.

384
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:01,570
Thank you, thank you.

385
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,150
Okay, nice.

386
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,970
Alright, one of the sound guys are here.

387
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,590
Alright, that's good.

388
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:09,270
Alright, let me... Alright, Onimusha.

389
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,910
Borgar, thank you for the super chat.

390
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:14,690
Thank you, thank you.

391
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:19,990
Hi Doki, I want to thank you in the community for motivating me this past year, even through tough times.

392
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,250
Because as of today, I'm graduating and getting my associate's degree.

393
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,090
And get ready to pursue my dreams!

394
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:25,750
Congratulations!

395
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,050
Happy graduation!

396
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:30,330
Yay!

397
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,810
Congratulations, man!

398
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,250
See, guys.

399
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:38,870
We... I knew our IQ... Average IQ was higher.

400
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,030
I knew it.

401
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:43,750
Alright.

402
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,890
Let's play some Onimusha!

403
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:48,690
Okay, yes.

404
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,990
I... Do not remember any of the controls, guys.

405
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:53,610
Alright.

406
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,530
Okay, let's see.

407
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:56,150
There's this.

408
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,530
Oh my god, where am I?

409
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,830
I forgot I'm her.

410
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:00,570
Uh...

411
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,370
Okay, let me figure this out, guys.

412
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:02,770
Okay.

413
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:03,790
This.

414
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,010
And then...

415
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:06,590
Okay.

416
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:08,690
Strong attack.

417
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:09,830
And then...

418
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,450
Okay, do I need this, though?

419
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,210
Wait, what is this for?

420
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:14,690
Oh, wait.

421
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,390
This is for, like, shimmying.

422
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,510
I gotta shimmy here.

423
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,090
And then this is block.

424
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,050
And then I accidentally used my knife.

425
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:21,950
That's pretty bad.

426
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,710
Okay, that's fine.

427
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:23,610
That's fine.

428
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:24,750
Where am I?

429
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:25,870
Oh!

430
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,070
Where is she?

431
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,890
I don't know where she is.

432
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,790
Where is this?

433
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:32,130
Oh!

434
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,270
I remember this place!

435
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:33,690
Never mind.

436
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:34,210
I remember.

437
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,910
A mysterious statue of a woman.

438
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,150
There is a hole in this body.

439
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,870
Okay, so I need to find, like...

440
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,470
Something to open this up.

441
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:42,710
Oh, shit!

442
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,070
Wait, that's illegal.

443
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:46,370
Oh, shit!

444
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:46,790
I forgot!

445
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,630
I don't remember how to play it.

446
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,510
Never mind.

447
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,630
Never mind, guys.

448
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,850
I actually don't remember how to play this game.

449
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:55,890
Oh, shit!

450
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,010
Am I...

451
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:57,690
Am I doing it?

452
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,490
Oh, shit!

453
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,750
Guys, I don't think I'm doing it.

454
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:00,830
I am...

455
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,710
Oh, my God.

456
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:04,950
Oh, she gets stuck, too.

457
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:05,470
Thank God.

458
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:06,910
Okay.

459
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,150
That's fine.

460
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:10,470
I block.

461
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,610
Okay, never mind.

462
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:13,550
Oh, okay.

463
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,050
There you go.

464
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:21,410
Am I though?

465
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,910
Am I actually ready?

466
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,130
Who knows?

467
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,890
I'm not ready!

468
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,530
Oh, please!

469
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,370
I'm not ready!

470
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,710
Wait.

471
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:33,930
I think there was heals here.

472
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,230
Oh, that wasn't heals.

473
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:36,390
That was...

474
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,310
Bro is not ready.

475
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,730
I don't remember how to play the game.

476
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:42,510
Please!

477
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,390
Alright.

478
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,110
We're fine.

479
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,090
We're so fine.

480
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:49,370
Okay.

481
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:50,030
We got...

482
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:50,310
Wait!

483
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,110
It despawns?!

484
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:52,610
Fuck!

485
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:52,930
Okay.

486
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,370
I didn't realize it despawns.

487
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:57,330
Okay.

488
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,050
Let me...

489
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:58,650
Okay.

490
00:19:58,810 --> 00:19:59,190
Suck.

491
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:03,370
I don't get it.

492
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,510
Why didn't do all that?

493
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,790
Why didn't you do that?

494
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,090
Okay.

495
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,350
Okay.

496
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:12,450
Alright.

497
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,130
That's fine.

498
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:14,370
Okay.

499
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:15,330
I figured it out.

500
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,230
I didn't even figured it out.

501
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,370
Oh, shit!

502
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,230
Oh my god.

503
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:21,670
It's fine.

504
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:23,530
Please.

505
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,310
She...

506
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,490
She thinks she's ready?

507
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:32,250
You know, as long as she thinks she's ready, then that's good enough.

508
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,650
Oh my god.

509
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:34,010
Please.

510
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:34,650
Please.

511
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,590
I am not ready.

512
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:36,330
Please.

513
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:36,850
No!

514
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:37,930
Oh wait.

515
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:38,670
Heals.

516
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,130
I don't understand.

517
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:41,750
Do more!

518
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,810
Why aren't you doing combos?!

519
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:47,250
Alright.

520
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,950
I don't know why she's not comboing.

521
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,130
It's not me.

522
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,510
It's clearly not me.

523
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:54,630
Looks like I...

524
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,390
This is a...

525
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,830
Looks like I can play something here?

526
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,570
I don't fucking know.

527
00:20:58,770 --> 00:20:59,710
Maybe a key play?

528
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,370
Oh yeah!

529
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:04,650
Yeah!

530
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,380
Someone has to be ready.

531
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,100
Okay.

532
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,660
Audio could be brought up a bit.

533
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:15,960
Alright.

534
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,820
I hope nothing tries to kill me while I do this.

535
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:20,580
Okay.

536
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:21,600
Alright.

537
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,480
Let me know if it's better.

538
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,920
I'm sure Jube...

539
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,400
Oh, okay.

540
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,740
So that's for Jube.

541
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:26,840
Okay.

542
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,020
Alright.

543
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,020
Let's...

544
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,700
You know what?

545
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,760
Let's put that in the second save.

546
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,440
I don't trust myself for some reason.

547
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,180
OH SHIT!

548
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,020
Okay.

549
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:41,500
Nice.

550
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,500
Oh my god.

551
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,160
I'm doing combos.

552
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:44,880
Let's go!

553
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,480
Okay.

554
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,040
Suck.

555
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,660
Ready.

556
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,140
Ready.

557
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:50,540
Oh my god.

558
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,260
How did I miss?

559
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:53,680
Okay.

560
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,000
It's fine.

561
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,280
It's fine.

562
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,100
We're so healthy.

563
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:58,860
Oh.

564
00:21:59,260 --> 00:21:59,700
Suck.

565
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:00,800
Okay.

566
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,020
How are you missing?

567
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,200
He's right there!

568
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,540
I don't think she's ready, guys.

569
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:08,460
Guys.

570
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,680
I don't think she's ready.

571
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,360
It's not me.

572
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:10,760
It's her.

573
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,760
Alright.

574
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,860
Elevator instructions.

575
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,100
Despite repeated requests, the elevator has not been fixed.

576
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,080
This is completely unacceptable.

577
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,960
In fact, it's downright outrageous.

578
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:27,820
I told you that the turbine on the ceiling isn't turning because there is no wind.

579
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,480
What is the matter with you?

580
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,740
If Lord Nobunaga hears about this, you'll regret not listening to me.

581
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,900
Get this elevator fixed now.

582
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,840
This is your final warning.

583
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,600
Guys.

584
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,720
It's not me.

585
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,080
It's her.

586
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,300
I was doing so well on Jube.

587
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,780
So it's not me, guys.

588
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,520
Alright.

589
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,480
Okay.

590
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,500
I also need to get coughed.

591
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:56,880
Wait.

592
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,580
Give me a sec, guys.

593
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,960
I'm gonna go get coughed drops real quick.

594
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,520
Oh, he left.

595
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,060
Wait.

596
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,760
He did leave!

597
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,770
I knew it!

598
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:16,930
Okay.

599
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,870
He just doesn't like loud noises.

600
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:19,570
I knew it.

601
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,270
He did leave, guys.

602
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:22,110
It's not me.

603
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,030
I mean, it is me.

604
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,570
I had to grab water.

605
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:43,350
Okay.

606
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:44,890
He just doesn't like it when I'm loud.

607
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,390
It's not the singing, guys.

608
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,070
It's not the singing.

609
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,810
He just doesn't like it when it's loud.

610
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,190
So it's not me.

611
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,030
Alright.

612
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,270
Let me get water.

613
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,910
It's not the singing I say as I cope.

614
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,470
Alright, I'm ready, for real.

615
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:10,110
Okay, clearly I can't go here yet.

616
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,210
Where do I go?

617
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,590
Okay, I can do that.

618
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,170
That guy was easy.

619
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:18,330
Oh, shit.

620
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:19,490
Okay.

621
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,010
What?!

622
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,570
Okay, that was bullshit.

623
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,110
Alright, nice.

624
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,250
Chop.

625
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:31,850
Alright, suck.

626
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:35,710
Okay, where have I not... Okay, I haven't went through here yet.

627
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,370
This is new.

628
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:39,350
Oh, fuck!

629
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,130
That's fine.

630
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:41,870
I was ready.

631
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:43,050
Whoa!

632
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:43,950
I was ready!

633
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,290
See, I told you!

634
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,050
It wasn't me, it was her!

635
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,070
I knew it!

636
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:51,930
It's never me.

637
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:52,310
Whoa!

638
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,030
Okay.

639
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,330
I told you!

640
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,370
It wasn't me!

641
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,150
You suck.

642
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:07,950
Alright.

643
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,310
Can I go through here?

644
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,310
It's locked from the other side.

645
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,990
This picture is terrible.

646
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,390
I can't even look at it.

647
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,770
What an eerie picture.

648
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,310
Feels like it's watching me.

649
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,910
Look, those artists worked really hard on those pictures.

650
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:24,930
How is that proof?

651
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,490
The proof is that I'm...

652
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:30,570
I mean...

653
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,290
Oh my god, please!

654
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:32,310
Oh my god, nice!

655
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:33,570
Okay.

656
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:34,910
Suck.

657
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:35,350
Please.

658
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:35,810
Please.

659
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:36,250
No.

660
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:36,670
No.

661
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,570
Get me that suck first.

662
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:39,270
No.

663
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,330
Okay, I got the HP.

664
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:43,270
We're fine.

665
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,970
I got the HP, guys.

666
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,770
We're so healthy.

667
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:49,850
Suck.

668
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:51,270
Look at that.

669
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,690
We're so healthy, guys.

670
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:56,750
See, I told you.

671
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:58,490
I got it.

672
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,270
I figured it out!

673
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,050
Wait, am I supposed to beat up this?

674
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:05,430
Okay, wait.

675
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:06,530
I'll charge this up.

676
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:09,970
Boom!

677
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:11,610
There we go.

678
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:14,090
I finally figured out the game mechanics.

679
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:16,890
What the fuck?

680
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:19,230
Wait, am I actually supposed to kill that?

681
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,100
What are you?

682
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,760
What the fuck are you?

683
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,900
I have no idea what that is.

684
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,820
It's just there.

685
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,700
The Oni Super Weapon.

686
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:43,720
The chief of the Yagu Clan, who descended from the Oni Clan, tried hard to maintain and control of the demons.

687
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:49,980
The Oni Clan used all of their resources to create a great power known as the Onigenbu and Onigashima.

688
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:56,940
Although the demons attacked and destroyed the Oni Clan to get their claws on the Onigenbu, the Oni Clan was able to protect it somehow.

689
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,520
It's still hidden deep inside the island.

690
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:04,140
It said that the only one who has the blood of the Oni Clan can obtain this great power.

691
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,220
Okay, so that's something for Jubei later.

692
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,940
What did I get?

693
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,900
Oh my god, I finally got the fucking map.

694
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,160
I don't remember how to look at the map, though.

695
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,620
It was this, right?

696
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:15,960
No.

697
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,360
It was...

698
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,840
Oh my god, how do I look at the map?

699
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,760
Map where?

700
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:20,880
I don't care.

701
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,500
Okay, I got medicine though, at least.

702
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,020
Thank god.

703
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:25,480
I...

704
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,700
I remember I had...

705
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,260
No more medicine from fighting Mr. Nimbus.

706
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:36,420
Alright.

707
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,560
Let's see.

708
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,300
Where is it?

709
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,700
No, that's not the map.

710
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,240
How do I look at the map?

711
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,560
Oh, it's the...

712
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,280
Oh, I found it!

713
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,520
I figured it out, guys.

714
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,480
I'm so smart.

715
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:49,560
Alright.

716
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,420
Oh, wait.

717
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,080
Let me boost up the volume a little bit more.

718
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:52,520
Okay.

719
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:54,700
Uh...

720
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:54,920
Alright.

721
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,240
Let me know if that's better.

722
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:58,820
I remember.

723
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,360
Okay, I'll just charge this up.

724
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:04,740
That's right.

725
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,820
Okay, I'm facing the wrong direction.

726
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:09,760
Okay.

727
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:10,700
Alright.

728
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,140
That's right, for later.

729
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,580
For later.

730
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,160
You have to get close, right?

731
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,000
There you go.

732
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,680
See, I told you.

733
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,360
That's right.

734
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,080
Oh, he's just standing there watching.

735
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,100
Come on.

736
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,000
Get over here.

737
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,100
Eventually, one of you guys have to move up.

738
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,060
Okay, it's like that.

739
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,140
Oh, no.

740
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,040
Oh, no.

741
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:34,760
Oh, no.

742
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,520
Wait, I didn't mean you.

743
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,380
Oh, no.

744
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,420
I didn't mean you.

745
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,600
Oh, no.

746
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,380
Okay.

747
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,880
Oh, my God.

748
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,780
How many are...

749
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,100
Oh!

750
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,100
He's coming closer!

751
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,380
He's slowly moving up!

752
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:52,880
Whoa!

753
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:53,720
Whoa!

754
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,200
Shit!

755
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,080
Oh, fuck.

756
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:56,380
Okay.

757
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:57,840
Oh, my God.

758
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,480
He can block.

759
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,720
Oh, my God.

760
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,020
Please.

761
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,700
Okay, wait.

762
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,460
Oh, never mind.

763
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,300
Oh, never mind.

764
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:11,580
Nice.

765
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,020
Is he dead?

766
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,200
Oh, he's dead.

767
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,500
Thank God.

768
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,860
What is this?

769
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,540
Nothing.

770
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,240
See, I told you guys I'd be fine.

771
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,760
Look at that.

772
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,880
Nothing to worry about.

773
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,060
hello.

774
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,120
What the fuck?

775
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,580
What the...

776
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,160
What the...

777
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:30,280
What the fuck?

778
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,500
What?

779
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,200
What?

780
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,280
Oh, my God.

781
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,200
Wait, that's unfair.

782
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,220
Wait, that's legal.

783
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,500
Hello?

784
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:38,620
Hello?

785
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,180
Okay, I can just block all of this.

786
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,540
Am I... supposed to kill them?

787
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,040
Like... Oh shit, I am!

788
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,400
Oh, this is awkward.

789
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,960
Okay, this is actually awkward now.

790
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,440
Because I'm pretty sure, like, they've created a lot.

791
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,280
A lot of glass.

792
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,820
Okay, they might destroy more now.

793
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,540
Okay, maybe they'll come up here.

794
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,600
I believe.

795
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,520
Oh wait, no, they're all dead.

796
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,660
Wait, it was only two?

797
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,360
I swear I saw, like, six of them.

798
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,860
How is there only two?

799
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,440
Okay.

800
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,180
Wait, poison?

801
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:21,600
What?

802
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,580
I don't wanna... I don't wanna get close to it.

803
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,980
I just saw, like, a poison thing.

804
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,380
I don't know what made a poison.

805
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,600
Okay, it's just there.

806
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,600
Okay, as long as I don't get close to it, it should be fine.

807
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,280
Okay, stab.

808
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,400
Okay, what is that?

809
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,280
What is that?

810
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,040
What is that?

811
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,300
Who is making the poison?

812
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:48,740
Oh!

813
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,980
Who the fuck is making the poison?

814
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,140
I can't tell!

815
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,220
I have locked cameras!

816
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,040
Wait, what?

817
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:01,800
What's that?

818
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,300
Wait, what?

819
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:04,300
What's that?

820
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,000
I can't tell!

821
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,440
What are you?

822
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,780
What are you?

823
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,520
Alright.

824
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,040
Oh my god, I fucking hate off-screen attacks.

825
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,560
I literally don't know what it is.

826
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,740
Like, they're still coming!

827
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,180
They just don't stop coming!

828
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:18,660
Oh!

829
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,320
And they're attacking from the ground, too?!

830
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,180
Okay.

831
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,940
Let's chop him for now.

832
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:31,760
Okay.

833
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,080
That's fine.

834
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,640
Get on the ground.

835
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,560
I know you want to.

836
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,360
Alright.

837
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,160
I should have killed all the little guys.

838
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:42,640
What are you?

839
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,700
Oh my god, it's you.

840
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,120
It's you.

841
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:45,920
It's you.

842
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,620
That's fine.

843
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,840
Oh my god, fuck!

844
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,520
That's not fine!

845
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,500
That's not fine!

846
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,260
Come on!

847
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:57,760
Come on!

848
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,460
Do something!

849
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,520
Oh shit!

850
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,200
Oh shit!

851
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:02,800
Not you!

852
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,180
Not you!

853
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,960
I didn't mean you!

854
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:08,660
I meant me!

855
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,120
He's like, You did say do something!

856
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,080
I...

857
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,320
Oh my god!

858
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,340
He...

859
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,840
Still keeps regenerating!

860
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,980
Please just die!

861
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,060
Okay, there you go.

862
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,580
There you go.

863
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,300
Oh, it's like a...

864
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,320
Oh, it was like a giant mantis thing.

865
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,380
What's this?

866
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,960
Looks like I can go into the wall.

867
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,280
Wait, no, not yet.

868
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,140
Alright.

869
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,580
Oh, that's for the main statue thing.

870
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,240
Can I break it?

871
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,520
Okay, no.

872
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,880
That has to be...

873
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:47,520
Jujuje.

874
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,320
What's his name again?

875
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,480
I already forgot his name.

876
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,600
I haven't played him in so long!

877
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,300
Jube.

878
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,900
That's Jube's wall.

879
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,340
Also, I upped the...

880
00:32:59,340 --> 00:32:59,460
Oh.

881
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,020
Could be brought up even more.

882
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,160
Okay, let me bring up the volume even more.

883
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,860
Alright, let me know if that's better.

884
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,120
I was like, what's his name again?

885
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,100
It's been so long.

886
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,440
I feel like I haven't seen him in so long, guys.

887
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:16,910
Okay, that's fine.

888
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:21,690
Okay, I didn't think I'd see, like, his little minions, though.

889
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:24,010
It might not be as fine as I thought it'd be.

890
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:25,870
Oh my god.

891
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:26,690
Okay.

892
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:31,170
I need you to fall down so I can do this.

893
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,230
Not- No!

894
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,090
Not you!

895
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:33,190
No!

896
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:37,290
Okay.

897
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,250
Goddamn, the stupid auto-lock.

898
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:44,010
Oh.

899
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,970
Oh, this guy fucked me up.

900
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:48,130
Because I didn't know what I was doing.

901
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:51,650
And that's the only reason why he fucked me up, guys.

902
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:53,210
There you go.

903
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:58,070
I just didn't know what- how to play- I forgot how to play the game.

904
00:33:59,470 --> 00:33:59,990
Yeah.

905
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:02,390
Alright.

906
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:03,930
Oh, fuck!

907
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:04,310
No!

908
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:05,910
He's faster!

909
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:07,690
No!

910
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:09,090
He's so much faster!

911
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:13,830
Okay.

912
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,210
Jesus Christ.

913
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,050
Come on, guys.

914
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,930
I'm not playing around.

915
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,880
What I got earlier was a shield.

916
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,640
Oh, I can equip?

917
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,380
That's a shield?

918
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,820
Oh my god, it is!

919
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,300
But still manageable.

920
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,620
Okay, we need that.

921
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,900
That might be a better shield.

922
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,440
Oh, I got a knife.

923
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,560
Wait, is that a better sword?

924
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,860
Oh, it is!

925
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:42,540
Okay.

926
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,400
That's good.

927
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,820
We need all the items we can get.

928
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,300
Oh!

929
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,460
Okay, that definitely looks like a boss fight.

930
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,460
Right there.

931
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:56,760
Oh, no?

932
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:57,720
It's not?

933
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,800
Okay, thank god.

934
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,920
Oh, never mind!

935
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:03,420
Okay.

936
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,520
I can take him.

937
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,820
I told you.

938
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,320
I knew it!

939
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,020
Wait, what?

940
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:12,720
Oh!

941
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,940
Wait, he got bigger?

942
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,660
He's like, you killed my brother!

943
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,720
Oh, shit!

944
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,080
Oh!

945
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:19,280
That's fine.

946
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,460
There we go!

947
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,000
Oh!

948
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:21,720
There we go!

949
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,100
Oh my god!

950
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:22,780
Oh my god!

951
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,700
She's okay!

952
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,560
She's okay!

953
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,860
She's okay!

954
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,860
Oh, fuck.

955
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,020
I have to use it.

956
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,080
I have to use it.

957
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,120
Guys, it's okay.

958
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:38,900
She's okay.

959
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,480
She's so healthy.

960
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:45,840
Okay.

961
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:46,740
There we go.

962
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,140
I told you guys.

963
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,600
She's so healthy, guys.

964
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,960
She's so healthy.

965
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,580
Oh, fuck.

966
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:52,880
No!

967
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,500
It's the fix!

968
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,780
It's not a fix!

969
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,300
The fear!

970
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,200
The fixed camera angle!

971
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,100
It was just a scratch.

972
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,000
Alright, I got the sacred flute.

973
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,780
I have no idea what to do with this flute.

974
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,140
I blame the fucking fixed camera angle.

975
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:21,820
Alright.

976
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:27,180
I literally walked away because of the angle change.

977
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,000
Alright.

978
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,300
Do I just use the flute?

979
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,860
What the fuck do I do with the flute?

980
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,120
Oh!

981
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,720
Wait, no.

982
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,700
I was looking at the wrong one.

983
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:41,060
Dispel it by producing... Okay.

984
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,460
Where do I use that?

985
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,720
Where the fuck do I use it?

986
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,580
Okay.

987
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,180
Where am I?

988
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,260
Okay.

989
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,180
I guess we go back up.

990
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:56,820
Oh!

991
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:01,020
The remaster is back... It's on... Or... Yeah.

992
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,960
The remaster is on the... Steam right now.

993
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:10,050
Alright.

994
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:10,050
What?

995
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:15,290
Jesus Christ.

996
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,550
Stop dodging!

997
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,750
He's like, hey guys, what you guys doing?

998
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:25,550
That poor... That poor guy.

999
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,770
He just wanted to say hi.

1000
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,470
He got hit by the collab.

1001
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,640
I'm ready.

1002
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:36,740
Okay.

1003
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,260
He's like, hey guys.

1004
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,020
Oh my god.

1005
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:48,520
No!

1006
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,060
You stupid bug!

1007
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,180
Okay.

1008
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:54,940
There you go.

1009
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,600
He's still dead.

1010
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,140
Oh!

1011
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,940
Oh, Dokimusha.

1012
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,340
Bring... More!

1013
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:01,760
Okay.

1014
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,840
I'll bring up even more.

1015
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:03,860
Alright.

1016
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,280
I brought it up even more.

1017
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:05,340
Alright.

1018
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:11,960
Okay.

1019
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,980
At least these guys aren't like annoying.

1020
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,600
They're just... Okay.

1021
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,060
Never mind.

1022
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,540
I say that and then one of them is like, I'm not annoying!

1023
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,600
I'll show you!

1024
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,060
I'll fucking show them all!

1025
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:25,720
Okay.

1026
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:26,620
Yeah.

1027
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,600
Are you happy now?

1028
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,500
You got your one hit?

1029
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,920
Are you happy?

1030
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,860
You little fucker?

1031
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:36,330
Alright.

1032
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:36,650
Alright.

1033
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:37,270
Let's go this way.

1034
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:37,990
Alright.

1035
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:37,990
Let's go this way.

1036
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:38,750
I have to go back up.

1037
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,490
Enter the wall.

1038
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:44,490
Does that mean if I play my flute here, it opens?

1039
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:49,330
Where would my... Where would the flute work for?

1040
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:52,230
Okay.

1041
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,370
I can't use that here.

1042
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,470
Where do I use it then?

1043
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:00,150
I guess up... Back up top?

1044
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,610
I don't know where to use it.

1045
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,290
Wait.

1046
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:06,210
Wait, does the XP I get from these guys go back to Jubei?

1047
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,490
I just want... Want to be sure.

1048
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:18,750
Yeah, but who the fuck is... Golgantris?

1049
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,110
Who the fuck is that guy?

1050
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:23,890
Oh, it does.

1051
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:24,230
Okay.

1052
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,310
I was gonna say, is it worth fighting all these guys?

1053
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,900
God, I hate backtrack.

1054
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,900
I just want to go straight!

1055
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,080
Oh, fuck.

1056
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:40,620
It's him again.

1057
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,640
This guy I hate.

1058
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,380
This guy I hate so much.

1059
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,540
Oh, nice.

1060
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,260
Oh, never mind.

1061
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:46,540
Wait.

1062
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,420
Why is he so weak?

1063
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,640
Why are you?

1064
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,920
Are you just like... You just forgot to roid up?

1065
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,320
Oh, no.

1066
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,000
He roided too much.

1067
00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:03,200
I heard like... If you use too much... Um... steroids... Like, it doesn't actually do much for you.

1068
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,080
It's too much.

1069
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,780
And also, it makes your peepee smaller too, apparently.

1070
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,200
Holy fuck!

1071
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,160
Stop dodging!

1072
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:16,860
All right.

1073
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,220
Nice.

1074
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,020
Where do I go?

1075
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,600
Some fun facts.

1076
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,440
Uh... Okay.

1077
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:28,960
I go that way?

1078
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,920
Wait, there was a shortcut over there?

1079
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,120
Wait, there was a shortcut over there?

1080
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,160
Are you...

1081
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,220
Oh, my God.

1082
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,420
Oh, I gotta bring up just a little bit more?

1083
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:47,920
All right.

1084
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:48,780
Here you go.

1085
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,380
Where the fuck do I have to go?

1086
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,160
I'm so lost.

1087
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,240
Here?

1088
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,180
Where is here?

1089
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,840
There's something over here?

1090
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:03,780
No?

1091
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,400
There's like a little door over here somewhere.

1092
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,600
I don't know where it is.

1093
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,720
Okay, I got one of them.

1094
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,580
Oh, fuck!

1095
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,400
Okay, that's fine.

1096
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,060
Oh, item!

1097
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,240
Oh.

1098
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:20,760
Okay, wait.

1099
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,920
Wait, wait, wait, wait, guys!

1100
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:22,260
Wait!

1101
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:22,840
Yay!

1102
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,080
Oh, it was just a dagger.

1103
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,380
Okay, that's fine.

1104
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,320
Stop!

1105
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,340
Pause!

1106
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,860
I gotta grab item!

1107
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,560
There's like...

1108
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,080
But why is it even accessible in the first place?

1109
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,560
There's something here.

1110
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,220
Because like, it says there's...

1111
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,060
Oh, my God.

1112
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,560
That's where the shortcut was supposed to be.

1113
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:58,680
That's where the shortcut was supposed to be.

1114
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,320
And I missed the shortcut.

1115
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,020
All right.

1116
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:10,060
I guess there has to be something over back here then.

1117
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:13,700
Okay.

1118
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,480
Oh, this sword does more damage.

1119
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,440
Are you fucking...

1120
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:18,820
Please.

1121
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,340
Why did you have to get up?

1122
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,580
Yeah, this sword definitely do more damage.

1123
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:26,830
Okay.

1124
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:28,250
Save.

1125
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:31,590
Just in case.

1126
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:36,630
Where are you supposed to go, woman?

1127
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:40,590
I don't remember...

1128
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:40,890
Where does...

1129
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,990
Oh, I have to bring him the flute!

1130
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,670
But how do I get back?

1131
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:49,010
Okay.

1132
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,110
Jube, I got the flute!

1133
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,290
I forgot...

1134
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:56,410
I forgot I could leave at any time I want.

1135
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:00,350
Oh, my God.

1136
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:02,390
I could leave any time I want.

1137
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:04,030
I thought I was locked in.

1138
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:07,450
My mother...

1139
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:08,510
Even in the afterlife.

1140
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:10,630
She thinks of you.

1141
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,140
You can defeat the demons.

1142
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:20,220
It's not like Jubei where like, I'm stuck here forever.

1143
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,180
She has her own free will.

1144
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:27,730
Oh, I'm so sad.

1145
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:30,110
Apparently, I could never go back to the village.

1146
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:32,290
That was like, the one time.

1147
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:35,130
That was the one time.

1148
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:37,750
But they're like, you can never go back.

1149
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:39,550
He actually meant it.

1150
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,810
He was like, you can only pick one.

1151
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:44,990
And apparently, I definitely, I picked the wrong choice.

1152
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:46,190
The wrong woman.

1153
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:47,970
Because I got greedy.

1154
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:51,290
Why do I always get greedy, guys?

1155
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:56,310
I picked the wrong woman.

1156
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:58,810
And I can't go back.

1157
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:02,790
Nice.

1158
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:10,170
At least I got more souls.

1159
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:12,530
I'm so sad.

1160
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:15,470
I can't believe I actually picked the wrong.

1161
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,470
Is it worth upgrading my armor?

1162
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,230
Or should I just keep upgrading?

1163
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:22,410
Should I just keep upgrading?

1164
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:23,350
Jesus Christ.

1165
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:25,010
There's archers now!

1166
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:28,610
Oh my God.

1167
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:30,510
I can't believe it.

1168
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:32,630
That's it.

1169
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:34,230
I'm using magic.

1170
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:36,650
That's how much I hate you.

1171
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:39,770
Oh my God.

1172
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:41,250
I can't even get these archers.

1173
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:42,850
They're so far up.

1174
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:45,030
I can't even get them.

1175
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:45,490
Okay.

1176
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:47,430
All right, guys.

1177
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:50,550
Is it worth upgrading my armor or nah?

1178
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:52,230
I don't know.

1179
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:53,410
But I need to know first.

1180
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:56,310
Okay.

1181
00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:59,010
Let's grab the new sword.

1182
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:07,090
I just need to know if it's worth it first before I try.

1183
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:08,090
Okay, it's a hammer.

1184
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:08,950
Let's grab this hammer.

1185
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:13,870
No, just don't get hit.

1186
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:15,710
You're right.

1187
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,510
You're so right, guys.

1188
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,610
Just don't get hit, guys.

1189
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:26,970
It's just that easy, everybody.

1190
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:29,430
Okay, I should upgrade the hammer though.

1191
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,110
Oh my God.

1192
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:37,350
I don't even have enough.

1193
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:38,330
Okay, that's fine.

1194
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,470
I don't even remember like where I have to go.

1195
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:42,330
Where I have to go.

1196
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:43,110
Oh, shit.

1197
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:44,310
Okay.

1198
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:46,130
Holy fuck!

1199
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:47,950
I'll take that.

1200
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:50,350
That was on accident too.

1201
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:55,530
I literally accidentally did a perfect parry.

1202
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:57,990
And not mean to.

1203
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,660
He like jump scared me.

1204
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:05,500
And I was like, Fuck.

1205
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:06,840
Oh, fuck.

1206
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:10,880
All right.

1207
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,520
Okay, so I think I have to...

1208
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,080
Oh, I have to go back to the...

1209
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,040
What was it?

1210
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,080
That area.

1211
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:17,560
Over there.

1212
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,260
No, not here.

1213
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:19,620
I have to go here.

1214
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,900
The area with the...

1215
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,320
Uh...

1216
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:23,460
Yeah.

1217
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,980
With the little door.

1218
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,160
Oh, shit!

1219
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:30,740
That's fine.

1220
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:32,960
Okay.

1221
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:34,540
Boom.

1222
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:37,780
Oh, shit.

1223
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:38,720
Wait, you're alive?

1224
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:39,220
Woo!

1225
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:40,480
JK!

1226
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:42,120
It's just an...

1227
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:42,380
Ah!

1228
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:46,360
I'm so sorry!

1229
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:49,260
I didn't mean to!

1230
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:53,730
Jesus Christ!

1231
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:55,250
Oh, he still has so much HP!

1232
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:57,290
No, I wish I had my perfect parry!

1233
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:58,230
Oh my god!

1234
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:04,330
Guys, I missed my perfect parry.

1235
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:07,330
Now I know how strong they actually are.

1236
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:09,570
Okay, I actually hate this.

1237
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:10,470
I don't like this weapon.

1238
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:12,990
Uh...

1239
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:13,710
Let's try it.

1240
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:15,950
Let's do this spear.

1241
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:20,050
Oh my god, there's more of them.

1242
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:21,030
Oh my god!

1243
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:21,530
There's...

1244
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:22,290
And there's...

1245
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:22,950
Are you serious?

1246
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:24,230
Oh!

1247
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:27,010
This stupid fucking archer.

1248
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:31,430
Alright, that's fine.

1249
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:32,990
Get out.

1250
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:36,910
Stupid goddamn archer.

1251
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:38,970
The fucking archer, of course.

1252
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:43,310
Oh, please tell me he's not here.

1253
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:44,790
Okay, that's fine.

1254
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:45,550
That's fine.

1255
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:46,470
These guys are fine.

1256
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:47,370
These guys are fine.

1257
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:48,250
I...

1258
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:48,830
Every time!

1259
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:53,500
Every...

1260
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,040
Every fucking time!

1261
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,600
I swear to god.

1262
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:02,700
Please!

1263
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,200
I was so used to using the girl!

1264
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,180
I forgot to use the man!

1265
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:17,360
I was so used to her!

1266
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:21,120
I like figuring out her moveset and everything!

1267
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,860
Oh my god, please.

1268
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:29,460
Please!

1269
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,700
Okay, we're fine.

1270
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:43,190
I...

1271
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:45,470
It's okay.

1272
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:46,290
It's okay.

1273
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:47,030
It's okay.

1274
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:47,810
It's okay.

1275
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:48,850
We might be...

1276
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:50,210
We're okay.

1277
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:51,290
See, I told you.

1278
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:51,810
We're okay.

1279
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:53,270
We're okay.

1280
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:56,310
It's this way.

1281
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,070
I told you guys!

1282
00:48:58,070 --> 00:48:59,230
We're so healthy!

1283
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,290
We're so okay!

1284
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:10,870
All right, at this point, sound guy, you should have said, bring it up a lot more.

1285
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:18,490
We're doing a little violent...

1286
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:19,190
Oh, shit, nice.

1287
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:21,970
All right, here we go.

1288
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:22,930
Now we figured...

1289
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:23,450
See, look at that.

1290
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:25,270
Oh my god, you're here too?!

1291
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:28,310
Oh my god, not him!

1292
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:30,590
Why did you use magic here?!

1293
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:35,310
Okay, this is where we needed the magic.

1294
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:36,770
Oh my god!

1295
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:38,250
Please.

1296
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:40,110
Oh my god, that's fine, that's fine.

1297
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:40,650
We need it.

1298
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:43,150
It's fine that he hit us just a little bit.

1299
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:44,750
So I could do this.

1300
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:47,990
Cornado!

1301
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:49,490
Cornado!

1302
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:53,470
Okay, now I don't have any more.

1303
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:58,050
I think I have one more magic!

1304
00:49:58,330 --> 00:49:58,830
I do!

1305
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:01,250
Boom!

1306
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,210
There you go.

1307
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:05,410
I knew it eventually.

1308
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:09,750
Eventually he dies.

1309
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:13,310
There we go.

1310
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:14,290
What?

1311
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:15,890
What shot me?

1312
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:19,190
I swear to god, if I...

1313
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:20,410
Wait, what shot me?

1314
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:23,610
What's still...

1315
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:24,910
What is there to shoot me?

1316
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:28,670
All right.

1317
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:32,110
That might be a little overkill, but I'm angry.

1318
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:36,670
All right.

1319
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:39,090
What is it?

1320
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:39,450
What is it?

1321
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:39,830
Wait, what?

1322
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:41,010
Oh my...

1323
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:43,250
He's on the other side?!

1324
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:45,170
How is that fair?

1325
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:48,630
You're not even like...

1326
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:51,310
Like, I can't even access that!

1327
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:52,990
How is that?

1328
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:56,830
Your stupid plant!

1329
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:02,680
All right.

1330
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:06,820
Oh my god, he's so fucking stupid.

1331
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:13,210
I know, he like literally wall hacked me for no reason.

1332
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:17,410
Okay, there we go.

1333
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:21,110
Give me your souls.

1334
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:23,810
Okay, circle key.

1335
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:25,030
Where the fuck does that unlock?

1336
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:26,550
I'm so...

1337
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:28,730
Like, where is that?

1338
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:30,870
Where the fuck is the circle key for?

1339
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:35,440
Oh, there you go.

1340
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:36,100
I opened it.

1341
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,960
Oh no!

1342
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:40,600
No!

1343
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:41,260
No!

1344
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:41,980
Get me out!

1345
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,480
I need to kill your archers!

1346
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:44,620
Get me out of here!

1347
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,100
They need to die first!

1348
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:50,960
Okay.

1349
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:54,300
No, no, no!

1350
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:54,840
It was worth it!

1351
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:56,660
Shit.

1352
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,300
Okay, I need to use this.

1353
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:58,900
I can't.

1354
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:01,780
Like, I have to use that.

1355
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:03,120
It was an emergency.

1356
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,160
Where the fuck does it?

1357
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,100
The circle key goes in the circle, old Doki.

1358
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,640
Okay, where the fuck is...

1359
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,720
All right, so it's up here?

1360
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:15,760
I guess it's up here, right?

1361
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:17,740
Should be.

1362
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,060
I can't.

1363
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:29,920
I can't.

1364
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:30,440
No!

1365
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:31,860
He still hits me!

1366
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:37,780
I thought I was being clever!

1367
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:40,060
He still hits me.

1368
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:44,340
I'm so sad.

1369
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,140
Oh my god, I'm so low.

1370
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:48,500
That's fine.

1371
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:51,240
I won't.

1372
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,760
I just need to not get hit by these guys.

1373
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,080
By the archers.

1374
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:58,540
Just... Okay.

1375
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:02,620
Just in case I'm stuck in the loop, let me put it at number three.

1376
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:03,820
Just in case.

1377
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:05,540
Okay.

1378
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,000
I was scared.

1379
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:09,540
Ah, no!

1380
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:10,940
Okay.

1381
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:11,760
Okay.

1382
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:12,460
Okay.

1383
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:13,540
We're still okay.

1384
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:14,740
We're still okay.

1385
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:16,040
Just don't get hit.

1386
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,180
Just don't get hit.

1387
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:20,120
Alright.

1388
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,200
Just remember what they say.

1389
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,540
Just don't get hit.

1390
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:28,120
Guys, I think maybe... No, we can live.

1391
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:28,880
We can live.

1392
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:29,700
We can live.

1393
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:30,800
We can live.

1394
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,700
There's still... There's still hope for us.

1395
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,220
There's still hope.

1396
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,980
Guys, I have one medicine right now.

1397
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:42,680
I just... I don't know.

1398
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,680
I just... I really don't want to use it.

1399
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,580
I really don't want to use it.

1400
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,180
Until we're ready.

1401
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:53,520
Okay.

1402
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,120
Is that circle enough?

1403
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:57,460
No?

1404
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:00,180
Oh, maybe here.

1405
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,300
Oh, fuck.

1406
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,440
Please don't hit me.

1407
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,260
Please don't hit me.

1408
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:08,040
Okay.

1409
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:08,660
Okay.

1410
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:09,440
Okay.

1411
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:10,220
Okay.

1412
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:10,960
Okay.

1413
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:11,580
We're fine.

1414
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:18,800
Please don't hit me.

1415
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,060
Oh, God.

1416
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:20,800
Oh, God.

1417
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:21,480
Oh, God.

1418
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:21,760
No!

1419
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:24,840
Oh!

1420
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:28,800
Just... Okay, we live.

1421
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:30,000
We still live.

1422
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,020
We're still okay.

1423
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:36,040
We're still okay.

1424
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,000
It's okay.

1425
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,240
Alright, we're cutting it a little close.

1426
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:43,860
But we're okay.

1427
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:44,880
Oh my god!

1428
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,580
Okay, you scared me a little.

1429
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,720
Alright, look.

1430
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:52,000
See?

1431
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,020
We did it.

1432
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:55,480
Living on... What the fuck?

1433
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,660
Where does this key go?

1434
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,080
It's not anywhere here.

1435
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:06,490
Okay.

1436
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:13,630
Where could the circle be?

1437
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:18,810
It's... What's the other room?

1438
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:20,570
The place with the ceiling fan?

1439
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:21,930
The elevator?

1440
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:26,710
Oh, I didn't notice there was a keyhole there.

1441
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:29,930
Okay, it's the elevator.

1442
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:35,150
Okay, we're not... I'm scared of the archers.

1443
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:37,830
I'm so scared of the archers.

1444
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:40,470
Jesus fucking Christ.

1445
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:43,110
Here?

1446
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:47,770
Where would the keyhole be?

1447
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:50,670
That's the ceiling fan.

1448
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:52,330
Oh!

1449
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:53,830
Win magic!

1450
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:55,010
Oh my god!

1451
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:56,810
That's what fans are for!

1452
00:55:57,670 --> 00:55:59,450
Oh my god!

1453
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:02,790
That's what win does!

1454
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:05,570
Oh my god!

1455
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:10,470
That's so smart!

1456
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:12,850
What if I didn't have magic?

1457
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:16,370
That's actually really smart.

1458
00:56:17,090 --> 00:56:19,010
I was not thinking about that.

1459
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:20,910
No way!

1460
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:24,250
Wind produces wind?

1461
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:24,610
Wind produces wind?

1462
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:27,630
Okay.

1463
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:29,490
Oh my god!

1464
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:30,850
Oh my god!

1465
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:33,370
Why does it lock like that?!

1466
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:38,950
Okay, this is like my biggest gripe about this game.

1467
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:47,570
I... Like if there's more than one enemy, I literally... I can't lock... I can't like do a final blow.

1468
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:50,470
That's actually such a huge gripe.

1469
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:55,130
Oh.

1470
00:56:55,130 --> 00:56:55,570
Whoops.

1471
00:56:57,150 --> 00:56:59,190
Wait, wasn't there a staircase behind me?

1472
00:56:59,270 --> 00:56:59,470
Yeah.

1473
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:03,350
I knew.

1474
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:05,410
I was like... I remember seeing a staircase up here.

1475
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:06,490
Haha, can't catch me.

1476
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:07,170
I'm on a ladder.

1477
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:10,930
Oh, okay.

1478
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:11,890
That's a circle.

1479
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:13,290
A circle key.

1480
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:16,050
Oh, never mind.

1481
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:16,710
Never mind.

1482
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:17,510
Never mind.

1483
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:18,230
It's circular!

1484
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:26,370
Okay, guys.

1485
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:26,610
Look.

1486
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:27,430
It was circular.

1487
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:31,330
What's this?

1488
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:33,810
What is that?

1489
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:40,130
Friendly?

1490
00:57:44,370 --> 00:57:45,650
Are you...

1491
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:46,770
Oh!

1492
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:47,110
Oh!

1493
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:47,870
He was not friendly!

1494
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:48,790
He's not friendly!

1495
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:49,950
He's not friendly!

1496
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:51,910
I don't know!

1497
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:52,970
Oh, shit!

1498
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:54,570
He is definitely not friendly!

1499
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:55,710
He's not...

1500
00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:58,070
It's Robocop.

1501
00:57:58,490 --> 00:57:59,330
Okay, look.

1502
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:01,130
How was I supposed to know?

1503
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:03,970
Jesus!

1504
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:05,730
What the...

1505
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:06,710
Wait, he hit himself!

1506
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:08,370
Idiot!

1507
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:12,390
Oh, my God!

1508
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:13,490
They're taking your... Oh, my God!

1509
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:14,150
I did not mean that!

1510
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:15,130
Oh, I'm sorry!

1511
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:17,070
Sorry!

1512
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:21,390
Okay, nice.

1513
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:23,950
Jesus Christ!

1514
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:25,370
What the fuck?!

1515
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:29,310
Okay.

1516
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:30,630
That should kill him.

1517
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:32,850
Alright, nice.

1518
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:34,690
And that gave it zero HP.

1519
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:36,550
Oh, my God.

1520
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:39,970
Oh, that took a lot of my HP, guys!

1521
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:44,050
Oh...

1522
00:58:44,050 --> 00:58:45,630
No, you saw him!

1523
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:47,130
He hit first, guys.

1524
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:49,250
He definitely hit first.

1525
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:51,350
Oh, my God.

1526
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:51,710
Okay.

1527
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:54,310
It's not my fault.

1528
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:56,330
It was self-defense, chat.

1529
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,040
Uh...

1530
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,320
Um...

1531
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:16,890
Uh...

1532
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:17,110
Oh...

1533
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:20,030
Uh...

1534
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:20,850
Oh!

1535
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:25,650
Whoops!

1536
00:59:26,770 --> 00:59:28,130
Oh, I figured it out!

1537
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:29,410
Oh, this one.

1538
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:33,590
Okay, not like that.

1539
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:34,610
Okay, I figured it out.

1540
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,660
Oh my god, I'm so smart.

1541
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:48,700
Gun!

1542
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:50,400
Oh my god, I got gun.

1543
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,780
I'm hanging by the thread, but I have my gun.

1544
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:56,440
This is it.

1545
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:57,940
Nothing can stop me now.

1546
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:02,040
I don't remember how to use the gun.

1547
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:04,660
I don't remember how to use the arrow.

1548
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,380
But don't worry, nothing can stop me now.

1549
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:10,760
I have a gun by my side.

1550
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:16,280
Okay, but how do I progress?

1551
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:17,780
Puzzles might stop me.

1552
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,820
Oh, I need that.

1553
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:22,100
Yeah, okay.

1554
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:25,620
Okay, I guess I'll take the magic, I guess.

1555
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:29,640
What's this?

1556
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,100
Oh, I know how to do this.

1557
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:38,080
Okay, 15 plus 14 is 29.

1558
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:42,300
So, 30, 31, 32, 33.

1559
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:44,360
Okay.

1560
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:46,600
Maybe?

1561
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:49,940
And then...

1562
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:56,000
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.

1563
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:57,460
That's 24.

1564
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:00,960
Wait, no, that's 24.

1565
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,000
Okay.

1566
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,460
And then, 10.

1567
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:06,820
Okay, and then...

1568
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:09,600
Look guys, I'm using my fingers to count.

1569
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:11,420
21.

1570
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:13,840
22, 23, 24.

1571
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:16,880
Wait...

1572
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,360
Wait, that doesn't make sense.

1573
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:22,140
Wait, 21.

1574
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:26,620
22, 24.

1575
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:28,480
Or... Wait, no.

1576
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:30,020
Wait.

1577
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:35,060
I think I fucked up already.

1578
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:36,380
Wait, no, I didn't.

1579
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:37,480
Because it locked in.

1580
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:38,640
Wait.

1581
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:45,300
But... That doesn't make sense.

1582
01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:51,890
Wait, but... I don't have another ten.

1583
01:01:53,490 --> 01:01:55,150
I don't have another ten.

1584
01:01:58,390 --> 01:01:59,570
Can I reset it?

1585
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:00,150
Oh, I can!

1586
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:00,650
Okay.

1587
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:00,730
Okay.

1588
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:04,490
So, I'll put one here.

1589
01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:06,790
And four here.

1590
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:07,850
Okay.

1591
01:02:08,490 --> 01:02:09,330
Twelve, thirteen.

1592
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:13,470
Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one.

1593
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:19,110
And then we'll put the thirteen here.

1594
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:22,790
And then we put the ten here.

1595
01:02:24,030 --> 01:02:30,920
And then... Twelve... Twenty-one.

1596
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:32,800
Is that twenty-one?

1597
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,980
Three, three, fifteen, sixteen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty-one, twenty-one.

1598
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:38,720
Twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-one, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven.

1599
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:44,920
Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty, three, one, thirty, two, thirty, thirty... Okay.

1600
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:45,320
Seven.

1601
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:45,760
Yay!

1602
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:49,460
Fingers!

1603
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:50,240
Rick!

1604
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:53,640
Who needs a calculator when I have my hand?

1605
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:54,960
Alright.

1606
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:57,080
Nice.

1607
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,120
What's this?

1608
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:04,860
I have a scarlet jewel?

1609
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:05,400
What?

1610
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,820
What is the circle key for?

1611
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,140
What is this key for?

1612
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,400
What does the circle mean?

1613
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:15,140
Alright.

1614
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:18,580
I might eat meat abacus.

1615
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:18,840
Yeah.

1616
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:19,740
Exactly.

1617
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:21,700
Oh my god.

1618
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:22,840
There's no save point anywhere.

1619
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,920
Uh, Guildenstern's book.

1620
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:26,440
Alright.

1621
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:27,060
What does it say?

1622
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:33,780
Dear Lord Nobunaga, I'm wondering if you approve of the golden evil statue that was completed the other day.

1623
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:39,600
As one of the best engineers in the demon world, I designed it and directed it according to your plan.

1624
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:45,540
It is my opinion that the late king of Fortinbras would never have thought of such a perfect plan.

1625
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:47,640
I enjoyed the project very much.

1626
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:51,260
If you have any other requests, please do not hesitate to let me know.

1627
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:55,720
I promise I will devote my heart and soul to any project you send my way.

1628
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,720
What a great name for a statue.

1629
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:02,820
Not just a golden statue.

1630
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:05,260
It's an evil golden statue.

1631
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:05,560
Got you.

1632
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:10,820
So you know.

1633
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:13,140
You know it's particularly evil.

1634
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,020
Alright.

1635
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:17,180
Yeah.

1636
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:20,420
Let me double check something real quick.

1637
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:20,660
Okay.

1638
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,480
I unmute myself a little for a sec there.

1639
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,540
Because I have to blow my nose.

1640
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:29,900
And sometimes when I have to mute myself and unmute myself.

1641
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:30,500
Oh my god.

1642
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,120
My HP is so fucking low.

1643
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,140
It doesn't go down.

1644
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:36,960
It like fucks up the audio.

1645
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:39,320
Is it worth fighting these guys?

1646
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:41,080
Okay.

1647
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:42,440
As long as I don't hit him.

1648
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:45,280
I don't think it's worth fighting these guys.

1649
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:47,120
They seem like very mad.

1650
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:48,740
Yeah.

1651
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:49,360
Oh wait.

1652
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:50,080
Wait.

1653
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:50,960
They are friendly.

1654
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:51,760
Guys.

1655
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,160
Why didn't you tell me to hit him?

1656
01:04:59,220 --> 01:04:59,660
Guys.

1657
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:02,760
I can't believe you told me that hurt innocent workers.

1658
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:06,300
Alright.

1659
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:07,660
This must be for the goal.

1660
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:08,120
This must be for the golden key.

1661
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:12,360
Okay.

1662
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,380
And then just jump across.

1663
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:13,660
Right?

1664
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:15,360
Oh look.

1665
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:16,000
There are the workers.

1666
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:19,640
Oh is this?

1667
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:20,380
Oh my god.

1668
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,460
That's what the circle key is for.

1669
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:24,420
Oh my god.

1670
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:28,360
Oh my god.

1671
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:32,540
Recently, my lord has become extremely busy with managing the demon planning human hunts.

1672
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,120
Visiting the renovation site at Onigashima.

1673
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,360
And constructing the tower of Gifu Castle.

1674
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:42,500
Since I am but a mere human, it's too difficult to keep up with my lord.

1675
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:49,540
But thanks to my lord's brilliant piece of equipment called the light path, I can instantly travel between Onigashima and Gifu Castle.

1676
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,260
Now, I can travel and devote my full service to the lord.

1677
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:56,680
Oh, he's like the token human in the demon army.

1678
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:00,600
Okay, so...

1679
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:03,140
This is easy.

1680
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:09,360
My god.

1681
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:10,200
What the fuck?

1682
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:11,460
This is...

1683
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:12,200
What is this?

1684
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:13,540
A puzzle made for children?

1685
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:15,620
Like...

1686
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:17,340
Alright.

1687
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:18,040
Light path.

1688
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:19,940
TP me to Gifu Castle!

1689
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,000
How do I get back?

1690
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:26,620
Wait.

1691
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:28,620
How do I get back home?

1692
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:31,260
Instructions unclear.

1693
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:36,950
Okay, this game was...

1694
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:41,050
When this game came out, wasn't this game like rated R or some shit?

1695
01:06:42,190 --> 01:06:44,130
This game was not for kids.

1696
01:06:45,950 --> 01:06:47,030
Okay, oh my god.

1697
01:06:47,330 --> 01:06:47,550
Six?

1698
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:51,970
Fucking no.

1699
01:06:53,970 --> 01:06:55,650
Okay, I think I fucked it up already.

1700
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:00,750
How the fuck do I send it over?

1701
01:07:04,570 --> 01:07:05,110
What?

1702
01:07:06,350 --> 01:07:07,730
Oh, rated M.

1703
01:07:07,910 --> 01:07:08,050
Okay.

1704
01:07:09,110 --> 01:07:10,870
Yeah, so this game was rated M.

1705
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:13,510
How the fuck?

1706
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:15,650
Okay, this puzzle is...

1707
01:07:15,650 --> 01:07:19,770
This puzzle is a lot harder than whatever the fuck I did last puzzle.

1708
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:30,100
How the fuck do I send that to the other side?

1709
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:39,800
I don't fucking know.

1710
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:42,740
I don't...

1711
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:43,080
What?

1712
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:45,980
How do I send this to the other side?

1713
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,640
Oh my god, okay.

1714
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,460
I don't know.

1715
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:13,860
I don't know.

1716
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:14,700
I...

1717
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:28,300
I don't...

1718
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:29,020
I don't know.

1719
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:29,540
How?

1720
01:08:42,490 --> 01:08:43,810
Oh my god, okay.

1721
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:45,350
Think Doki, think.

1722
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:46,670
I'm thinking.

1723
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:49,030
I'm giving it all that I got.

1724
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:53,680
Which isn't a lot.

1725
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:56,440
But, like, it's the effort.

1726
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:58,720
Oh my god.

1727
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:02,780
Oh!

1728
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:16,040
Okay, I figured it out.

1729
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:34,560
Guys, I...

1730
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:35,920
I already forgot how...

1731
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:36,420
I... I...

1732
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:37,120
Guys, I fucked up.

1733
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:37,600
I...

1734
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:40,520
Guys, I fucked up.

1735
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:50,190
I...

1736
01:09:50,950 --> 01:09:51,270
I...

1737
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:51,570
I...

1738
01:09:51,570 --> 01:09:51,710
I...

1739
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:53,090
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

1740
01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:55,270
I think I figured it out, though.

1741
01:10:03,610 --> 01:10:04,310
Okay, wait, wait.

1742
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:05,230
I figured it out.

1743
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:05,790
Wait, wait, wait.

1744
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:06,850
I figured it out, guys.

1745
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:20,040
Okay.

1746
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:23,960
I...

1747
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:26,640
Okay.

1748
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,400
Okay... I understand though.

1749
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:30,760
I understand.

1750
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:41,980
Okay, wait, wait, wait...

1751
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:55,550
Okay, I understand, I understand.

1752
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:08,410
Okay.

1753
01:11:09,570 --> 01:11:12,210
Okay, wait, wait.

1754
01:11:13,250 --> 01:11:17,150
No, no, this all makes perfectly clear to me.

1755
01:11:19,850 --> 01:11:20,450
Okay.

1756
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:20,830
Okay.

1757
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:29,190
Everything is very clear to me on what I need to do.

1758
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:31,530
Very, very clear.

1759
01:11:32,590 --> 01:11:33,510
Oh, fuck.

1760
01:11:33,930 --> 01:11:38,200
I... I... Fuck!

1761
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:39,220
Fuck!

1762
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:55,260
Okay.

1763
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:57,920
I don't even know how I did that.

1764
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:02,300
How the fuck... How did I do that?

1765
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,780
No, I did it again!

1766
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,020
I did it again.

1767
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:12,260
I did it again.

1768
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:14,420
No!

1769
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:20,880
Okay.

1770
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:44,610
If I... If I do... This?

1771
01:12:55,570 --> 01:12:58,550
Oh my god, it's not even a shape anymore.

1772
01:12:58,790 --> 01:13:01,190
It's not even a shape anymore!

1773
01:13:01,790 --> 01:13:07,760
I... I don't... I... I... I...

1774
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:16,560
Okay.

1775
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,220
Wait.

1776
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:30,930
Alright.

1777
01:13:33,390 --> 01:13:36,790
But... Maybe... I move this leg here.

1778
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:42,830
Then how do I get to the other side?

1779
01:13:44,570 --> 01:13:49,590
How do I... How do I... How do I get to the other side?

1780
01:13:49,950 --> 01:13:52,470
I'm trying to make it travel around the world!

1781
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:04,280
It's not even a shape anymore.

1782
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:07,180
It's not even a shape!

1783
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:23,080
Oh my god.

1784
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:24,660
I don't understand.

1785
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:26,240
Oh my god.

1786
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:29,760
They... There's an arrow guy shooting at me because I took so long!

1787
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,940
He was like... He's like, please.

1788
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:34,720
Please finish this puzzle.

1789
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:35,400
Sorry.

1790
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:36,840
Thank you for the super chat.

1791
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:37,260
Thank you.

1792
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:38,040
Thank you.

1793
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:41,340
She did, in fact, not figure it out.

1794
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:51,720
Maybe like this.

1795
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:51,760
Maybe like this?

1796
01:14:56,530 --> 01:14:57,250
Maybe like this?

1797
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:58,650
Then what do I do with all these shapes?

1798
01:15:00,010 --> 01:15:02,730
What do I... What do I do?

1799
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:06,730
Maybe like this?

1800
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,460
Maybe like this?

1801
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:20,000
Maybe like this?

1802
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:20,360
Maybe like this?

1803
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:22,120
Maybe like this?

1804
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:23,720
Maybe like this?

1805
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:24,940
Maybe like this?

1806
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:26,000
Maybe like this?

1807
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:26,100
Maybe like

1808
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:33,510
this?

1809
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:34,840
Maybe like this?

1810
01:15:40,850 --> 01:15:41,790
Maybe

1811
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:50,900
like this?

1812
01:15:58,840 --> 01:15:59,780
Maybe

1813
01:16:15,350 --> 01:16:16,570
like this?

1814
01:16:16,570 --> 01:16:17,030
How did I do that?

1815
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:31,600
Oh my god.

1816
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:33,100
I don't know.

1817
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:36,560
I feel like I tried every fucking combination possible.

1818
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:50,280
Oh my god, I made it back where it was before.

1819
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:54,700
I'm overthinking it?

1820
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:12,380
No, I made it back.

1821
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:15,000
It's the same thing.

1822
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,280
It's the same...

1823
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:28,380
How did I do it?

1824
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:37,140
How did I... How did I make it?

1825
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:53,260
I don't know how I did it.

1826
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:55,980
I was so close.

1827
01:17:56,420 --> 01:17:56,900
No.

1828
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:58,120
No.

1829
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:17,020
No.

1830
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,940
No, that's the worst part.

1831
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:20,600
When you were just there.

1832
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:22,820
When you were just right there.

1833
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:47,780
Oh, I made the bub...

1834
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:03,710
No, what did I do?

1835
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:05,270
What are you?

1836
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:06,830
What the fuck are you?

1837
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:09,150
I'm trying!

1838
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:14,390
Why did he give me so many moves?

1839
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:16,730
Why

1840
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,020
would they do this to me?

1841
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:36,500
This sucks.

1842
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:38,340
Oh my god.

1843
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,280
Oh my god!

1844
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:41,940
I

1845
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:52,100
did it again!

1846
01:20:06,950 --> 01:20:08,170
What did I make?

1847
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:11,330
I don't... I don't even know what I made.

1848
01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:14,850
Please finish the puzzle.

1849
01:20:15,150 --> 01:20:18,150
I haven't seen my family in years.

1850
01:20:18,630 --> 01:20:19,190
Sorry.

1851
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:21,010
Thank you in the super chat.

1852
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:21,610
Thank you.

1853
01:20:21,790 --> 01:20:22,290
Thank you.

1854
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:24,930
I don't even know what I made.

1855
01:20:25,130 --> 01:20:27,970
I did the same mistake again!

1856
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:41,020
Oh yeah.

1857
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:42,040
I know.

1858
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,280
I don't know.

1859
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:52,600
I don't know.

1860
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:53,120
I don't know.

1861
01:20:56,840 --> 01:20:58,420
Oh my god.

1862
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:24,200
I can do this.

1863
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:25,860
I can do this.

1864
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:45,150
She, in fact, couldn't do this.

1865
01:21:46,730 --> 01:21:48,250
What did I make?

1866
01:21:48,650 --> 01:21:50,910
What... What did I make?

1867
01:22:05,150 --> 01:22:06,210
Oh my god.

1868
01:22:06,410 --> 01:22:08,050
It's so... It's so abstract.

1869
01:22:08,850 --> 01:22:11,330
It's so... It's so abstract.

1870
01:22:11,730 --> 01:22:13,310
What the fuck did I make?

1871
01:22:32,510 --> 01:22:36,150
I'm trying... I'm trying... I'm trying my hardest.

1872
01:22:42,530 --> 01:22:44,230
I swear to god.

1873
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:47,530
My brain is cooking as much as it can cook.

1874
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:53,940
What am I making?

1875
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:55,900
I just... Just flip it.

1876
01:22:56,060 --> 01:22:58,220
If it was a mirror, it would...

1877
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:04,900
It's just becoming a blur.

1878
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:13,060
Everything is just becoming a blur.

1879
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:48,890
Where was that supposed to go?

1880
01:23:49,070 --> 01:23:50,770
Where is that supposed to go?

1881
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:05,520
What shape are you anymore?

1882
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:07,300
What shape are you?

1883
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:16,640
Oh, I did it.

1884
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:16,980
Nice.

1885
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:20,920
What the fuck?

1886
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:21,660
Yay!

1887
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:24,620
Yay!

1888
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:29,720
Girl, thank you for the... Thank you for the rain.

1889
01:24:30,260 --> 01:24:32,060
Thank you for the rain.

1890
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:34,180
Now you die.

1891
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:38,020
First try.

1892
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:39,640
Yay!

1893
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:43,800
We did it.

1894
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:45,140
Oh my god.

1895
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:47,840
That's just almost as sad as me doing that puzzle.

1896
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:49,640
Oh my god.

1897
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:52,040
We actually fucking did it.

1898
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:55,840
Holy fuck.

1899
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,300
I thought I would never leave.

1900
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:01,820
That was actually the hardest part of this game.

1901
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:08,560
The entire game, that one was the hardest part.

1902
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:11,180
The green wedge.

1903
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:18,640
Alright, at least I'm granted with HP.

1904
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:22,840
Combat in my puzzle game?

1905
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:23,760
I know, right?

1906
01:25:23,900 --> 01:25:24,660
Like what the fuck?

1907
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,040
Oh yes, it's maxed.

1908
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:27,220
Okay.

1909
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:31,400
I didn't play Onimusha for action.

1910
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:34,260
We're actually free.

1911
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:35,600
Yeah, we did it.

1912
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,000
I was like, oh yeah, we did it.

1913
01:25:38,060 --> 01:25:40,720
As if I wasn't stuck there for like 20 years.

1914
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:43,320
The green phantom realm?

1915
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:44,960
Where the fuck is that?

1916
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:52,020
I don't even know how I did it.

1917
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:53,180
I honestly...

1918
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:55,840
I don't even know how we did it.

1919
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:56,420
I...

1920
01:25:57,700 --> 01:25:58,860
I legitimately...

1921
01:25:58,860 --> 01:26:00,680
Can't even tell I did it.

1922
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:05,100
It's all like an actual blur to me right now.

1923
01:26:12,890 --> 01:26:16,230
I'm so impressed with what my lord has done these past few days.

1924
01:26:16,510 --> 01:26:19,450
Recently he has killed not only the monks, but also the women.

1925
01:26:19,630 --> 01:26:20,630
Oh, so impressive.

1926
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:21,050
Wow.

1927
01:26:21,390 --> 01:26:23,970
You killed defenseless women and children?

1928
01:26:24,270 --> 01:26:25,510
Oh my god.

1929
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:26,780
I'm so impressed.

1930
01:26:27,530 --> 01:26:29,570
The hardest things to kill in life.

1931
01:26:29,570 --> 01:26:33,330
He has no feelings or morals when it comes to the lives of humans.

1932
01:26:33,850 --> 01:26:37,790
And now, it's perfectly obvious to me that Odami Castle will fall.

1933
01:26:38,090 --> 01:26:41,650
Who else could conquer the entire country except for my lord?

1934
01:26:42,010 --> 01:26:44,110
It is wise for me to decide to serve him.

1935
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:48,310
If I follow my lord, I'll become rich beyond my dreams.

1936
01:26:48,990 --> 01:26:51,470
Clearly the hardest enemy of all time.

1937
01:26:51,650 --> 01:26:52,730
Women and children.

1938
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:54,970
Nice.

1939
01:26:54,970 --> 01:26:55,050
Nice.

1940
01:26:56,570 --> 01:26:57,150
Oh.

1941
01:26:57,770 --> 01:26:59,430
Is it worth going through here?

1942
01:26:59,670 --> 01:26:59,970
Okay.

1943
01:27:00,070 --> 01:27:02,110
But there is like something over on the other side.

1944
01:27:02,270 --> 01:27:02,850
I'll make sure.

1945
01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:05,750
What's on this side?

1946
01:27:10,170 --> 01:27:10,750
And...

1947
01:27:10,750 --> 01:27:11,550
East map.

1948
01:27:12,630 --> 01:27:13,210
Okay.

1949
01:27:13,810 --> 01:27:15,910
I'll go to the realm...

1950
01:27:16,430 --> 01:27:17,490
Burr, actually?

1951
01:27:19,010 --> 01:27:19,950
I don't know.

1952
01:27:19,950 --> 01:27:20,030
I don't know.

1953
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:22,950
I'm gonna go...

1954
01:27:22,950 --> 01:27:24,050
I'm gonna go to the portal.

1955
01:27:24,670 --> 01:27:25,850
And I feel like...

1956
01:27:25,850 --> 01:27:26,450
Maybe?

1957
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:31,970
Not only the monks, but the war monks and the child monks.

1958
01:27:32,130 --> 01:27:32,830
Thank you to the super chat.

1959
01:27:32,950 --> 01:27:33,210
Thank you.

1960
01:27:33,350 --> 01:27:34,170
Thank you, Gus.

1961
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:34,830
Okay.

1962
01:27:34,990 --> 01:27:37,250
That should be what the green wedge is for.

1963
01:27:39,470 --> 01:27:39,870
Alright.

1964
01:27:40,210 --> 01:27:41,810
I don't know where it's gonna take me.

1965
01:27:43,810 --> 01:27:44,210
Alright.

1966
01:27:44,210 --> 01:27:44,310
Alright.

1967
01:27:44,590 --> 01:27:46,570
Do I do this or do I go to the other side?

1968
01:27:46,910 --> 01:27:47,110
Guys.

1969
01:27:51,450 --> 01:27:54,410
I don't know if I should do this part or like the other side first.

1970
01:27:56,470 --> 01:27:57,070
Do it?

1971
01:27:58,590 --> 01:27:58,950
Uh...

1972
01:27:58,950 --> 01:28:00,690
Thank you for the super chat.

1973
01:28:00,830 --> 01:28:01,050
Thank you.

1974
01:28:01,230 --> 01:28:05,610
It gives me good equipment.

1975
01:28:05,870 --> 01:28:06,050
Okay.

1976
01:28:06,110 --> 01:28:06,670
We need that.

1977
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:08,110
Yeah.

1978
01:28:08,710 --> 01:28:09,530
I need that.

1979
01:28:10,010 --> 01:28:11,150
We definitely need that.

1980
01:28:11,270 --> 01:28:11,450
Oh.

1981
01:28:11,630 --> 01:28:11,770
Oh.

1982
01:28:11,890 --> 01:28:13,030
It's like a little...

1983
01:28:13,030 --> 01:28:13,710
Oh.

1984
01:28:14,090 --> 01:28:15,250
It's like a challenge area.

1985
01:28:15,870 --> 01:28:16,090
Okay.

1986
01:28:16,330 --> 01:28:17,010
I get it.

1987
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:22,410
Alright, let's do some...

1988
01:28:22,410 --> 01:28:22,750
Whoa.

1989
01:28:24,910 --> 01:28:26,370
Oh, it's like...

1990
01:28:26,370 --> 01:28:26,910
Oh, fuck.

1991
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:29,350
Alright.

1992
01:28:29,650 --> 01:28:31,150
I don't wanna waste...

1993
01:28:31,150 --> 01:28:32,410
My magic here.

1994
01:28:32,670 --> 01:28:34,250
If this is like a challenge area.

1995
01:28:36,550 --> 01:28:38,230
I feel like it'd be a waste.

1996
01:28:38,450 --> 01:28:39,590
If I use it here.

1997
01:28:43,070 --> 01:28:43,830
Oh, fuck!

1998
01:28:48,430 --> 01:28:49,530
Come on, guys.

1999
01:28:49,850 --> 01:28:51,710
Let me beat you up, guys.

2000
01:28:52,130 --> 01:28:53,290
It'll be so funny.

2001
01:28:54,350 --> 01:28:56,650
You can join your family and friends.

2002
01:28:56,850 --> 01:28:57,870
They're all there anyway.

2003
01:28:58,490 --> 01:28:59,810
It's better to do...

2004
01:28:59,810 --> 01:29:01,190
Do that than be lonely.

2005
01:29:01,730 --> 01:29:03,210
Being the last survivor.

2006
01:29:03,790 --> 01:29:04,350
Wait.

2007
01:29:04,730 --> 01:29:05,570
We go down.

2008
01:29:05,710 --> 01:29:06,710
Cause that's where hell is.

2009
01:29:11,230 --> 01:29:11,790
Okay.

2010
01:29:14,730 --> 01:29:15,550
Come on.

2011
01:29:15,550 --> 01:29:18,270
It's easier to be dead with your family and friends.

2012
01:29:18,690 --> 01:29:19,950
Than be alone.

2013
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:24,450
Be the last of your kind.

2014
01:29:24,630 --> 01:29:25,090
Look at like...

2015
01:29:25,090 --> 01:29:25,610
What's his name?

2016
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:26,910
What was that turtle's name?

2017
01:29:27,790 --> 01:29:28,510
Lonely George?

2018
01:29:28,870 --> 01:29:29,110
Come on.

2019
01:29:29,110 --> 01:29:30,290
You don't wanna be lonely, George.

2020
01:29:31,870 --> 01:29:32,890
Jesus Christ.

2021
01:29:35,190 --> 01:29:36,230
So lonely.

2022
01:29:39,490 --> 01:29:40,210
That it?

2023
01:29:41,290 --> 01:29:41,850
No.

2024
01:29:43,270 --> 01:29:44,950
Thought you could get away, didn't you?

2025
01:29:47,110 --> 01:29:47,850
That it?

2026
01:29:48,330 --> 01:29:49,250
Where's the last guy?

2027
01:29:49,810 --> 01:29:50,170
Hello?

2028
01:29:50,490 --> 01:29:51,210
Oh, there he is.

2029
01:29:51,650 --> 01:29:52,670
He's like, no!

2030
01:29:52,670 --> 01:29:52,790
No!

2031
01:29:54,070 --> 01:29:54,830
Oh wait.

2032
01:29:55,030 --> 01:29:56,070
Oh, you have a wife!

2033
01:29:56,550 --> 01:29:57,370
Don't worry.

2034
01:29:57,770 --> 01:29:58,250
You...

2035
01:29:58,250 --> 01:29:59,390
You had a wife.

2036
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:02,690
Alright.

2037
01:30:02,950 --> 01:30:03,250
Suck.

2038
01:30:05,810 --> 01:30:06,410
Alright.

2039
01:30:06,510 --> 01:30:06,950
Proceed.

2040
01:30:08,290 --> 01:30:08,890
Okay.

2041
01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:09,790
I don't think I need...

2042
01:30:09,790 --> 01:30:10,470
Okay.

2043
01:30:10,650 --> 01:30:10,970
You know what?

2044
01:30:11,070 --> 01:30:11,430
Fuck it.

2045
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:13,390
I really can't be bothered.

2046
01:30:17,390 --> 01:30:18,390
Oh shit!

2047
01:30:18,670 --> 01:30:19,290
Oh shit!

2048
01:30:20,410 --> 01:30:21,130
Oh my god!

2049
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:26,080
Alright.

2050
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:26,560
Hit me.

2051
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:28,100
Okay.

2052
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:30,260
Oh no.

2053
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:32,020
Okay, maybe I should...

2054
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:33,220
Oh fuck!

2055
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:33,600
Okay.

2056
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:34,600
Uh...

2057
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:37,620
Let me use this real quick.

2058
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:40,360
Oh shit.

2059
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:40,580
Okay.

2060
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:42,160
I wanted to freeze both of them.

2061
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:45,080
Guess not.

2062
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:45,760
Woo!

2063
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:48,940
Hit.

2064
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:50,260
Oh nice!

2065
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:52,260
Got your friend!

2066
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:54,740
Friendly fire!

2067
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:57,060
Friendly fire!

2068
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:58,680
I love it when there's friendly fire.

2069
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,540
I'm like 1 HP.

2070
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:01,240
This is bad.

2071
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:02,600
Alright.

2072
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:04,640
I have to use all my abilities here.

2073
01:31:09,050 --> 01:31:09,570
Okay.

2074
01:31:09,730 --> 01:31:09,890
Nice.

2075
01:31:10,230 --> 01:31:10,850
Oh nice!

2076
01:31:10,990 --> 01:31:11,810
He got sucked in too!

2077
01:31:12,370 --> 01:31:13,610
That's actually good for me.

2078
01:31:16,210 --> 01:31:16,730
Okay.

2079
01:31:16,730 --> 01:31:16,750
Okay.

2080
01:31:18,670 --> 01:31:19,850
Oh thank god.

2081
01:31:20,410 --> 01:31:20,750
Alright.

2082
01:31:21,130 --> 01:31:22,950
The win did so much there.

2083
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:23,510
Thank god.

2084
01:31:24,290 --> 01:31:26,810
That win actually was OP there.

2085
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:32,440
Okay.

2086
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:32,800
Nice.

2087
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:33,360
Suck.

2088
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:36,040
And they come in one by one too.

2089
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:37,020
Which is the best part.

2090
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:40,040
Okay.

2091
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:40,540
Nevermind.

2092
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:44,400
They used to come in one by one.

2093
01:31:48,780 --> 01:31:49,340
Nice.

2094
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:53,580
I have like range for that.

2095
01:31:53,780 --> 01:31:54,520
I can grab multiple.

2096
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:56,440
Alright guys.

2097
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:57,860
You know what would be great?

2098
01:31:58,020 --> 01:32:00,340
If you give me a little bit of the yellow.

2099
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Just a little bit of the HP.

2100
01:32:03,980 --> 01:32:04,740
Come on.

2101
01:32:05,060 --> 01:32:06,020
It won't hurt.

2102
01:32:07,100 --> 01:32:07,940
Oh shit.

2103
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:09,040
Proceed.

2104
01:32:10,260 --> 01:32:11,120
A little...

2105
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:12,080
Just a little bit.

2106
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:12,720
You know?

2107
01:32:13,220 --> 01:32:13,640
Oh no.

2108
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:15,780
Assume...

2109
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:16,100
There you go.

2110
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:19,100
Just come on.

2111
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:21,980
It would be so silly if you could give me...

2112
01:32:21,980 --> 01:32:24,140
Just a little bit of that HP yellow.

2113
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:28,360
Wouldn't that be a little silly?

2114
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:30,200
It would be so silly.

2115
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:33,520
Okay.

2116
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:34,500
I don't like those...

2117
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:35,200
These guys.

2118
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:36,120
So...

2119
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:37,340
Oh I don't have enough.

2120
01:32:37,660 --> 01:32:38,340
That sucks.

2121
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:39,800
I don't have enough for it too.

2122
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:40,800
Oh fuck!

2123
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:48,920
Didn't have...

2124
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:49,240
Oh nice.

2125
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:49,600
Okay.

2126
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:50,200
Alright.

2127
01:32:50,260 --> 01:32:51,880
I got the little bit of the...

2128
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:52,480
The yellow.

2129
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:56,300
They don't wanna be silly.

2130
01:32:57,800 --> 01:32:58,240
Okay.

2131
01:32:58,640 --> 01:32:59,120
Oh!

2132
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:04,320
Okay.

2133
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:06,480
When there's like multiple, I need to use this.

2134
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:11,000
Now I know though.

2135
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:13,380
If I have multiple, I have to use this.

2136
01:33:17,690 --> 01:33:19,210
I don't wanna be silly!

2137
01:33:19,470 --> 01:33:20,930
I wanna be serious!

2138
01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:24,090
Well too bad.

2139
01:33:24,550 --> 01:33:27,190
You should have thought of that before you went to silly school.

2140
01:33:28,350 --> 01:33:28,670
Oh nice.

2141
01:33:33,310 --> 01:33:34,010
Oh fuck!

2142
01:33:34,190 --> 01:33:35,390
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

2143
01:33:37,910 --> 01:33:39,910
That was a very manly scream.

2144
01:33:44,860 --> 01:33:45,860
You shouldn't have been...

2145
01:33:45,860 --> 01:33:48,620
You shouldn't have been an undecided major for so long!

2146
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:51,160
Now you gotta go and be silly!

2147
01:33:55,250 --> 01:33:55,770
Okay.

2148
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:01,960
Alright.

2149
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:03,120
Got that guy up.

2150
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:03,680
Oh!

2151
01:34:04,220 --> 01:34:04,960
Oh nice.

2152
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:05,520
Okay.

2153
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:12,170
Jesus Christ.

2154
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:14,240
It takes so long!

2155
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:16,400
How many are there?

2156
01:34:23,250 --> 01:34:23,990
Please!

2157
01:34:24,270 --> 01:34:27,550
I swear I killed like an entire family at this point.

2158
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:30,230
Entire generation is gone now.

2159
01:34:31,290 --> 01:34:31,950
Get out!

2160
01:34:33,510 --> 01:34:34,530
Welcome to...

2161
01:34:34,530 --> 01:34:35,950
It's like it's hell or something.

2162
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:38,210
I had that...

2163
01:34:38,490 --> 01:34:38,950
Went through...

2164
01:34:38,950 --> 01:34:39,930
Five floors, right?

2165
01:34:40,270 --> 01:34:40,670
Okay.

2166
01:34:40,810 --> 01:34:42,870
This feels like fucking five floors.

2167
01:34:43,430 --> 01:34:43,990
What?

2168
01:34:46,190 --> 01:34:46,930
I'm mad.

2169
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:47,850
That should have hit.

2170
01:34:50,010 --> 01:34:50,890
Oh my god.

2171
01:34:50,950 --> 01:34:51,490
Are you serious?

2172
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:00,040
There's more of you!

2173
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:01,060
No!

2174
01:35:01,060 --> 01:35:01,220
No!

2175
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:05,340
Okay.

2176
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:05,760
It's fine.

2177
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:06,020
It's fine.

2178
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:06,320
It's fine.

2179
01:35:12,270 --> 01:35:12,770
No!

2180
01:35:12,950 --> 01:35:13,530
No, no, no, no, no!

2181
01:35:14,310 --> 01:35:14,810
Oh!

2182
01:35:15,270 --> 01:35:15,730
It's fine.

2183
01:35:17,330 --> 01:35:17,730
No!

2184
01:35:17,870 --> 01:35:18,490
Oh my god!

2185
01:35:19,950 --> 01:35:20,450
Okay.

2186
01:35:21,050 --> 01:35:21,550
Okay.

2187
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:24,690
This is a little scary, but I do not wanna use...

2188
01:35:24,690 --> 01:35:28,230
I really, really don't wanna use my...

2189
01:35:28,230 --> 01:35:29,250
My HP.

2190
01:35:30,010 --> 01:35:30,970
Oh my god.

2191
01:35:30,990 --> 01:35:32,070
I don't wanna use it.

2192
01:35:32,230 --> 01:35:33,970
I don't wanna use it.

2193
01:35:35,670 --> 01:35:36,190
Okay.

2194
01:35:39,630 --> 01:35:40,150
Okay.

2195
01:35:42,030 --> 01:35:42,550
Okay.

2196
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:44,030
That's five.

2197
01:35:44,590 --> 01:35:45,390
That's five.

2198
01:35:46,490 --> 01:35:48,110
That should be the last floor.

2199
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:55,170
You guys told me it was five floors!

2200
01:35:55,690 --> 01:35:56,670
Oh, hey, Madison.

2201
01:35:58,050 --> 01:35:59,370
Wait, is this the fifth floor?

2202
01:36:01,910 --> 01:36:03,310
Wait, are you the fifth floor?

2203
01:36:03,450 --> 01:36:03,890
I can't...

2204
01:36:07,670 --> 01:36:08,930
Guys, all right.

2205
01:36:09,650 --> 01:36:10,330
All right.

2206
01:36:10,330 --> 01:36:11,810
I have to use it.

2207
01:36:11,950 --> 01:36:13,910
I have to.

2208
01:36:18,470 --> 01:36:18,990
Okay.

2209
01:36:21,830 --> 01:36:23,430
Oh, my... Okay, thank God.

2210
01:36:23,650 --> 01:36:26,090
Oh, wait, that's actually a good timing that I used it there.

2211
01:36:26,950 --> 01:36:29,210
That's actually incredibly good timing.

2212
01:36:29,870 --> 01:36:30,730
Holy fuck.

2213
01:36:33,770 --> 01:36:34,790
Oh, oh, oh.

2214
01:36:34,870 --> 01:36:35,530
Where am I?

2215
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:36,350
Where am I?

2216
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:40,030
No.

2217
01:36:40,630 --> 01:36:41,290
It could be that item.

2218
01:36:41,530 --> 01:36:42,310
Oh, my God.

2219
01:36:42,510 --> 01:36:44,610
What am I gonna do with mushrooms?

2220
01:36:53,190 --> 01:36:53,790
All right.

2221
01:36:54,750 --> 01:36:55,210
Is that it?

2222
01:36:55,470 --> 01:36:58,110
No, I still have one more guy that wants to fucking turn.

2223
01:36:58,710 --> 01:36:59,630
That wants to...

2224
01:37:01,050 --> 01:37:01,830
Oh, my God.

2225
01:37:01,910 --> 01:37:02,370
There's another one.

2226
01:37:03,290 --> 01:37:04,210
There's another one.

2227
01:37:04,210 --> 01:37:05,490
Okay.

2228
01:37:05,510 --> 01:37:05,630
Okay.

2229
01:37:06,030 --> 01:37:10,270
No, I wasn't supposed to...

2230
01:37:10,270 --> 01:37:11,210
No!

2231
01:37:11,650 --> 01:37:12,850
Why did it auto-hit?

2232
01:37:13,210 --> 01:37:14,870
So many things went wrong!

2233
01:37:21,260 --> 01:37:21,940
No!

2234
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:25,980
Oh, my God.

2235
01:37:25,980 --> 01:37:27,040
You said five!

2236
01:37:27,620 --> 01:37:29,820
I'm pretty sure I'm on 5.3!

2237
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:36,240
Alright, you guys lied.

2238
01:37:36,460 --> 01:37:37,300
You said five.

2239
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:41,100
This feels like it was actually... Sorry, Doki.

2240
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:42,580
It was actually a 10.

2241
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:51,220
I was gonna say, I'm pretty sure I'm at like 5.5 right now.

2242
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,860
This does not feel like five.

2243
01:38:02,980 --> 01:38:03,940
Jesus Christ.

2244
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:06,580
Oh, my God.

2245
01:38:10,190 --> 01:38:11,510
Five and five.

2246
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:12,590
Oh, sorry.

2247
01:38:12,690 --> 01:38:15,410
I just forgot to plus the other five, I guess, guys.

2248
01:38:15,730 --> 01:38:16,010
Right?

2249
01:38:19,610 --> 01:38:20,630
My bad.

2250
01:38:21,270 --> 01:38:23,150
I forgot to finish reading it.

2251
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:24,670
He meant five plus five.

2252
01:38:28,790 --> 01:38:30,110
Very easy mistake.

2253
01:38:37,330 --> 01:38:39,190
I can only count the four.

2254
01:38:48,030 --> 01:38:49,090
I... I... Oh, my God.

2255
01:38:49,250 --> 01:38:50,350
He still got... Okay, thank God.

2256
01:38:50,390 --> 01:38:50,970
He still got hit.

2257
01:38:51,210 --> 01:38:52,630
I was gonna say, oh, thank God.

2258
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:56,880
Woo!

2259
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:00,320
Still suck these guys.

2260
01:39:02,060 --> 01:39:02,460
What?!

2261
01:39:07,180 --> 01:39:08,020
Get out of here.

2262
01:39:08,220 --> 01:39:08,540
Nice.

2263
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:14,660
All right, which five are we on this time?

2264
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:16,020
What five is this?

2265
01:39:16,940 --> 01:39:18,560
What five is this, chat?

2266
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:22,360
Okay, wait.

2267
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:23,460
How do I...

2268
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:26,380
How do I use the ult... Oh, my God.

2269
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:27,100
I don't even remember.

2270
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:29,160
5.6.

2271
01:39:29,420 --> 01:39:29,880
All right.

2272
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:32,020
How do I use the...

2273
01:39:32,020 --> 01:39:33,560
Oh, my God.

2274
01:39:33,620 --> 01:39:34,300
Where's the book?

2275
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:35,480
Play instruction.

2276
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:37,420
How do I use the demon?

2277
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:38,540
I'm using demon mode.

2278
01:39:38,540 --> 01:39:38,560
Dude.

2279
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:40,020
Okay, LT and RT.

2280
01:39:41,700 --> 01:39:42,700
Five deluxe.

2281
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:44,180
This is it.

2282
01:39:44,580 --> 01:39:45,940
I cannot be... I... I can't.

2283
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:46,660
Oh, wait.

2284
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:47,620
I did it.

2285
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:51,740
Fuck this.

2286
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:00,840
Wait, wait.

2287
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:01,900
Give me my demon mode.

2288
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:02,300
No!

2289
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:03,620
I need my demon mode!

2290
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:04,800
You fucker!

2291
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,140
I need my demon mode!

2292
01:40:10,860 --> 01:40:11,380
No!

2293
01:40:12,100 --> 01:40:12,620
Please!

2294
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:13,920
It's not fair!

2295
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:14,360
I need this!

2296
01:40:14,460 --> 01:40:15,040
I need this!

2297
01:40:16,360 --> 01:40:16,880
Please!

2298
01:40:19,220 --> 01:40:20,220
It was worth it.

2299
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:21,180
It was worth it.

2300
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:22,360
It was so worth it.

2301
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:24,020
It was so worth it.

2302
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:29,680
Oh, my God.

2303
01:40:33,980 --> 01:40:34,500
Okay.

2304
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:37,880
This is fine.

2305
01:40:39,340 --> 01:40:40,300
It's worth it.

2306
01:40:40,940 --> 01:40:41,480
It's worth it.

2307
01:40:43,810 --> 01:40:44,450
All right.

2308
01:40:44,770 --> 01:40:45,310
There we go.

2309
01:40:46,330 --> 01:40:47,430
Oh, my God.

2310
01:40:47,870 --> 01:40:48,890
Oh, my God!

2311
01:40:48,910 --> 01:40:49,470
I did it!

2312
01:40:50,010 --> 01:40:51,550
I got a purple necklace!

2313
01:40:53,250 --> 01:40:54,670
And then I got medicine.

2314
01:40:54,870 --> 01:40:55,030
Wow!

2315
01:40:55,430 --> 01:40:56,370
I got medicine!

2316
01:40:56,710 --> 01:40:58,250
Like, the ones I just...

2317
01:40:58,250 --> 01:40:59,130
Okay, that's fine.

2318
01:40:59,410 --> 01:41:00,050
That's fine.

2319
01:41:00,570 --> 01:41:02,650
What the fuck is the purple necklace for?

2320
01:41:05,310 --> 01:41:07,270
Reduces the amount of magic required.

2321
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:08,050
Okay, that's good.

2322
01:41:08,150 --> 01:41:09,170
Actually, we actually need that.

2323
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:09,910
Oh, my God.

2324
01:41:10,090 --> 01:41:11,130
Actually, that's actually good.

2325
01:41:11,290 --> 01:41:11,950
That's actually good.

2326
01:41:13,010 --> 01:41:14,770
What comes after five?

2327
01:41:20,860 --> 01:41:21,260
Yes.

2328
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:22,380
Let me out.

2329
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:26,960
Let me out of here.

2330
01:41:31,340 --> 01:41:32,080
All right.

2331
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:32,820
We're out.

2332
01:41:34,260 --> 01:41:36,300
How do we get this, anyway?

2333
01:41:36,780 --> 01:41:37,320
Sealed.

2334
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:39,280
See?

2335
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:40,920
Just five floors.

2336
01:41:42,980 --> 01:41:45,920
I was gonna say, I was like, am I counting wrong?

2337
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:48,080
Can I just cat count?

2338
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:50,360
I was like, I think I went past five.

2339
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:51,760
I'm pretty sure.

2340
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:53,800
Am I counting wrong?

2341
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:55,320
Can I just cat count?

2342
01:41:58,180 --> 01:42:01,460
I was like, this feels like I'm past five.

2343
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:06,400
I was like, no.

2344
01:42:06,940 --> 01:42:08,080
No way.

2345
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:09,860
That's it.

2346
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:11,440
I cannot be bothered right now.

2347
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:15,320
Okay, nice.

2348
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:16,440
Oh, my God.

2349
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:17,200
That's HP.

2350
01:42:21,900 --> 01:42:22,480
Okay.

2351
01:42:23,180 --> 01:42:24,080
Cherry Blossom Key.

2352
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:25,520
Where is...

2353
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:26,100
Oh, wait.

2354
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:27,040
We had to...

2355
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:27,340
Whoa!

2356
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:32,900
Whoa!

2357
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:33,460
Wait!

2358
01:42:33,980 --> 01:42:35,700
Where did this guy come from?

2359
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:40,060
Okay, I was gonna say.

2360
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:42,420
Where did he come from?

2361
01:42:46,550 --> 01:42:48,350
He, like, teleports by...

2362
01:42:48,430 --> 01:42:49,130
Whoa, shit!

2363
01:42:51,750 --> 01:42:52,870
Oh, my God.

2364
01:42:52,990 --> 01:42:54,390
They just keep teleporting behind me.

2365
01:42:55,190 --> 01:42:57,250
I literally cannot deal with these guys.

2366
01:42:59,470 --> 01:43:01,730
Like, I have to use magic against them.

2367
01:43:04,570 --> 01:43:06,010
I'm like, I cannot.

2368
01:43:06,510 --> 01:43:07,330
I cannot.

2369
01:43:07,590 --> 01:43:09,510
These guys are actually terrible.

2370
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:13,900
Okay!

2371
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:18,220
You can't jump all of them!

2372
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:25,100
All right, I need to find the Crescent Moon for that.

2373
01:43:29,700 --> 01:43:30,200
Oh!

2374
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:32,560
Back on the sword, because it's my only maxed out...

2375
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:35,140
It's my only maxed out attack as equipment.

2376
01:43:39,770 --> 01:43:41,010
Oh, I'm back here!

2377
01:43:42,570 --> 01:43:43,550
Where'd I go?

2378
01:43:43,930 --> 01:43:44,750
Back here.

2379
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:49,880
This is, like...

2380
01:43:49,880 --> 01:43:50,210
This is, like...

2381
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:53,380
Okay.

2382
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:56,120
I really need to...

2383
01:43:56,120 --> 01:43:58,420
I need to find, like, a...

2384
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:00,560
A save point, though.

2385
01:44:00,980 --> 01:44:02,720
Like, I really need a save point.

2386
01:44:09,100 --> 01:44:09,760
Okay.

2387
01:44:10,140 --> 01:44:11,120
One by one.

2388
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:12,160
I'm patient enough.

2389
01:44:14,740 --> 01:44:15,400
Jesus.

2390
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:15,860
Okay.

2391
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:18,080
That's five.

2392
01:44:25,310 --> 01:44:26,410
One by one.

2393
01:44:27,330 --> 01:44:29,090
Single file, everybody.

2394
01:44:29,550 --> 01:44:30,550
Okay, let's...

2395
01:44:30,550 --> 01:44:32,650
I just better not be an infinite spawn!

2396
01:44:35,210 --> 01:44:36,170
They don't...

2397
01:44:36,170 --> 01:44:37,410
Yeah, I was gonna say...

2398
01:44:37,410 --> 01:44:38,970
I swear to God!

2399
01:44:39,590 --> 01:44:42,770
I ain't here to be an infinite spawn right now!

2400
01:44:43,930 --> 01:44:44,870
It's just...

2401
01:44:44,870 --> 01:44:47,090
Guys, it's just five enemies, guys.

2402
01:44:48,210 --> 01:44:49,350
Toki, it's just five.

2403
01:44:50,470 --> 01:44:52,130
Don't know what you're worried about.

2404
01:44:52,250 --> 01:44:53,070
Oh, there he comes!

2405
01:44:53,190 --> 01:44:53,790
Another one!

2406
01:44:58,620 --> 01:44:59,140
I...

2407
01:44:59,140 --> 01:44:59,720
Okay.

2408
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:02,060
I don't know how that guy got me.

2409
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:11,080
Out of here.

2410
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:12,080
Get out of here.

2411
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:15,360
Oh, my God!

2412
01:45:15,740 --> 01:45:16,880
I think it loops.

2413
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:18,600
Alright.

2414
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:19,660
I don't know.

2415
01:45:19,660 --> 01:45:21,780
Now I actually do think it loops.

2416
01:45:27,290 --> 01:45:29,570
Alright, I have a feeling it might be endless.

2417
01:45:30,450 --> 01:45:31,390
I don't know.

2418
01:45:34,590 --> 01:45:38,210
Alright, I swear to God, if another one TP's in...

2419
01:45:38,210 --> 01:45:38,590
I...

2420
01:45:38,590 --> 01:45:40,230
Okay, we fucking broke the loop.

2421
01:45:40,570 --> 01:45:41,710
We broke the loop, guys!

2422
01:45:42,250 --> 01:45:43,230
We did it!

2423
01:45:44,530 --> 01:45:45,810
We broke the loop!

2424
01:45:46,790 --> 01:45:47,890
Oh, my God!

2425
01:45:49,490 --> 01:45:50,290
That's right!

2426
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:52,130
All your friends are...

2427
01:45:52,130 --> 01:45:53,970
You thought you could keep floating yourself!

2428
01:45:54,610 --> 01:45:55,370
That's right!

2429
01:45:57,050 --> 01:45:58,630
We broke the cycle!

2430
01:45:59,270 --> 01:46:00,330
Okay, I'm leaving.

2431
01:46:00,910 --> 01:46:01,970
I need to save my game.

2432
01:46:05,610 --> 01:46:06,350
Wait, I...

2433
01:46:06,350 --> 01:46:07,510
I legitimately forgot how to suck.

2434
01:46:08,850 --> 01:46:09,550
Oh, it's...

2435
01:46:09,550 --> 01:46:12,470
I was like, what button is it again?

2436
01:46:17,050 --> 01:46:19,810
I pressed every button but the right one.

2437
01:46:20,530 --> 01:46:21,350
Whoa, shit!

2438
01:46:22,890 --> 01:46:25,410
Okay, I legitimately cannot be bothered with these guys.

2439
01:46:26,230 --> 01:46:27,270
He's like, hey, guys!

2440
01:46:27,490 --> 01:46:28,150
What's going on?

2441
01:46:28,150 --> 01:46:28,710
What?

2442
01:46:31,670 --> 01:46:32,370
Hey, Jerry!

2443
01:46:34,010 --> 01:46:35,270
Come here, my coffee break!

2444
01:46:38,450 --> 01:46:38,890
Alright.

2445
01:46:42,780 --> 01:46:44,440
Okay, now I can go through this door.

2446
01:46:46,300 --> 01:46:47,920
Still need an amulet for that.

2447
01:46:51,710 --> 01:46:52,930
Okay, got the crescent key.

2448
01:46:53,050 --> 01:46:54,070
Okay, so I just need to backtrack.

2449
01:46:55,510 --> 01:46:56,650
Humans as food.

2450
01:46:56,870 --> 01:46:57,650
I like that.

2451
01:46:57,650 --> 01:47:03,710
Creating the best ingredients has been a long, painstaking mission to mine for many years.

2452
01:47:04,230 --> 01:47:08,850
However, I've never found a perfect way to remove the innate cruelty of human beings.

2453
01:47:09,070 --> 01:47:12,150
It will allow several thousands of humans to roam in free space.

2454
01:47:13,310 --> 01:47:14,970
They'll eventually start killing each other.

2455
01:47:15,150 --> 01:47:16,190
Not over food, mind you.

2456
01:47:17,650 --> 01:47:18,990
But over territory.

2457
01:47:19,790 --> 01:47:22,750
What an incorrigible spirit species.

2458
01:47:23,370 --> 01:47:26,030
This makes it difficult to raise humans in a small area.

2459
01:47:26,030 --> 01:47:32,930
What is most difficult, though, is having to eliminate the human leaders of these fights in order to preserve our stock of humans.

2460
01:47:33,190 --> 01:47:39,990
And now, it's come to my attention that some demons believe that free-range humans are better than the cultivated ones.

2461
01:47:40,070 --> 01:47:42,210
Oh my god, they're creating human farms!

2462
01:47:42,630 --> 01:47:43,630
I mean, just...

2463
01:47:43,630 --> 01:47:45,390
Just farm children.

2464
01:47:46,310 --> 01:47:47,810
I think that's the easiest way.

2465
01:47:48,090 --> 01:47:48,950
Just make sure...

2466
01:47:48,950 --> 01:47:50,230
The moment they hit a teenage...

2467
01:47:50,990 --> 01:47:52,770
The moment they're teenagers, just eat them.

2468
01:47:53,250 --> 01:47:54,830
I mean, that's what nev...

2469
01:47:54,830 --> 01:47:55,190
Oh, wait.

2470
01:47:55,730 --> 01:47:57,370
Wait, that's the story of nev...

2471
01:47:57,370 --> 01:47:57,830
What was it called?

2472
01:47:58,150 --> 01:47:58,610
Never...

2473
01:47:58,610 --> 01:47:59,650
I forgot what...

2474
01:47:59,650 --> 01:48:00,310
You know that...

2475
01:48:00,310 --> 01:48:01,030
That...

2476
01:48:01,030 --> 01:48:05,430
That anime that was so good, and then it fell off hard in the second season?

2477
01:48:05,650 --> 01:48:06,950
Because it got so bad?

2478
01:48:13,470 --> 01:48:15,730
Yeah, just do what Promise Neverland did.

2479
01:48:15,830 --> 01:48:16,770
Just farm children.

2480
01:48:16,950 --> 01:48:17,790
It's that easy.

2481
01:48:18,450 --> 01:48:21,290
Until one of the child starts thinking...

2482
01:48:21,290 --> 01:48:22,450
Having too much free will.

2483
01:48:23,550 --> 01:48:25,750
Oh, farm the stupid ones!

2484
01:48:26,030 --> 01:48:26,950
As soon as they get...

2485
01:48:26,950 --> 01:48:29,790
As soon as you realize they get too smart, eat them.

2486
01:48:30,110 --> 01:48:31,270
Don't do what they did.

2487
01:48:31,410 --> 01:48:32,150
They made a mistake.

2488
01:48:32,370 --> 01:48:34,230
They were cultivating smart orphans.

2489
01:48:34,750 --> 01:48:35,250
They should...

2490
01:48:38,370 --> 01:48:39,770
That was their mistake.

2491
01:48:40,470 --> 01:48:41,210
Just make them...

2492
01:48:41,210 --> 01:48:42,110
Just make them dumb.

2493
01:48:42,390 --> 01:48:44,950
And the moment they start being too smart, just eat them.

2494
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:51,760
What does the smart ones take...

2495
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:53,340
They're not eating their brains!

2496
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:54,400
This is me!

2497
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,400
These are Japanese demons!

2498
01:48:57,200 --> 01:48:58,040
They're eating...

2499
01:48:58,040 --> 01:48:58,780
They're not eating brains!

2500
01:48:58,920 --> 01:48:59,760
They're not zombies!

2501
01:49:04,300 --> 01:49:05,320
I can't...

2502
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:06,420
They're not zombies!

2503
01:49:06,660 --> 01:49:08,120
They're just eating me!

2504
01:49:08,300 --> 01:49:09,040
Meat is me!

2505
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:10,900
Do you eat smarter cows?

2506
01:49:11,080 --> 01:49:11,360
No!

2507
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:14,120
You eat the cows that are eating better grass!

2508
01:49:15,260 --> 01:49:18,760
I can tell the difference just by holding the knife when I prepare the human body.

2509
01:49:20,700 --> 01:49:27,960
I must admit that I found a difference in the firmness of the humans who roam free as opposed to the ones who raise our cells.

2510
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:30,460
Yeah!

2511
01:49:30,660 --> 01:49:31,100
Free range!

2512
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:32,280
Just put them...

2513
01:49:32,280 --> 01:49:34,120
Put these humans in an open field!

2514
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:38,460
Yeah, we eat cows that are pampered and spoiled!

2515
01:49:38,740 --> 01:49:40,360
Not cows that are smart!

2516
01:49:42,380 --> 01:49:46,820
The best humans I've ever tasted would happen to be Tyra no Masakado.

2517
01:49:46,820 --> 01:49:53,860
This human broke his contract with the demons and, therefore, Asuna was soon set on the table for foreign brothers to feast upon.

2518
01:49:54,660 --> 01:49:57,400
I heard that Masakado had killed so many humans.

2519
01:49:57,560 --> 01:49:59,200
His name had been recorded in a history book.

2520
01:49:59,660 --> 01:50:03,700
Maybe there is a connection between the quality of the human flesh and their personality.

2521
01:50:03,700 --> 01:50:04,740
I don't know.

2522
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,100
The theory merits further research.

2523
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:10,800
Human Wagyu!

2524
01:50:11,160 --> 01:50:12,740
Yeah, just make sure they...

2525
01:50:12,740 --> 01:50:13,400
The...

2526
01:50:13,400 --> 01:50:13,880
What was it called?

2527
01:50:13,980 --> 01:50:14,520
The free...

2528
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:16,000
Like, free range chickenings?

2529
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:19,600
As long as we don't keep them in a cage!

2530
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:21,800
They taste good enough.

2531
01:50:22,060 --> 01:50:23,900
Oh my god, it's a bigger puzzle.

2532
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:26,140
Oh my god, I did it!

2533
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:30,580
Why was this one so easy?!

2534
01:50:32,720 --> 01:50:34,580
Alright, number 12.

2535
01:50:35,260 --> 01:50:35,840
Alright.

2536
01:50:40,430 --> 01:50:42,890
Wait, you hated this puzzle?!

2537
01:50:42,890 --> 01:50:45,230
That one was literally the easiest one!

2538
01:50:46,590 --> 01:50:49,650
The less moves it has, the easier it is.

2539
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:55,800
It's just because it has less moves.

2540
01:51:03,050 --> 01:51:04,530
Alright, let's go back.

2541
01:51:06,390 --> 01:51:07,670
Not fighting that.

2542
01:51:08,050 --> 01:51:08,890
Fuck that shit.

2543
01:51:09,210 --> 01:51:10,730
Oh my god, I'm leaving.

2544
01:51:11,970 --> 01:51:12,910
Fuck that.

2545
01:51:13,730 --> 01:51:14,890
That's way too many.

2546
01:51:15,030 --> 01:51:16,270
I'm already almost full HP.

2547
01:51:22,260 --> 01:51:23,620
Alright, let's get rid of him.

2548
01:51:28,090 --> 01:51:28,950
Okay, wait.

2549
01:51:29,890 --> 01:51:31,090
Thank you for waiting.

2550
01:51:32,250 --> 01:51:33,990
I like that he actually waited.

2551
01:51:34,170 --> 01:51:35,410
I really appreciate that.

2552
01:51:35,850 --> 01:51:37,070
I was like, wait.

2553
01:51:37,410 --> 01:51:38,070
He's like, okay.

2554
01:51:38,650 --> 01:51:39,130
Oh shit.

2555
01:51:43,050 --> 01:51:43,910
Alright, nice.

2556
01:51:48,170 --> 01:51:48,650
What?!

2557
01:51:49,030 --> 01:51:49,990
They can spit gas!

2558
01:51:50,090 --> 01:51:52,070
Okay, when were they able to spit gas?

2559
01:51:53,130 --> 01:51:54,150
Are you serious?

2560
01:51:54,390 --> 01:51:55,250
Get over here!

2561
01:51:55,390 --> 01:51:56,550
Get your ass over here!

2562
01:52:00,970 --> 01:52:01,450
Alright.

2563
01:52:02,310 --> 01:52:04,950
You're actually a waste of my resources.

2564
01:52:07,530 --> 01:52:08,750
Jesus Christ.

2565
01:52:10,730 --> 01:52:11,670
I'm so sad.

2566
01:52:12,330 --> 01:52:15,510
He actually, like, wasted my heals there.

2567
01:52:18,550 --> 01:52:20,230
There has to be one more, right?

2568
01:52:20,350 --> 01:52:20,530
No.

2569
01:52:21,210 --> 01:52:21,750
Oh, shit!

2570
01:52:22,650 --> 01:52:23,550
Oh, he missed.

2571
01:52:23,730 --> 01:52:24,250
Stupid.

2572
01:52:31,220 --> 01:52:31,600
Nice.

2573
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:33,780
Alright, we got the crescent key.

2574
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:37,060
Oh, fuck!

2575
01:52:37,480 --> 01:52:38,620
Oh my god.

2576
01:52:40,360 --> 01:52:41,680
They jump scared me.

2577
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:42,520
I was not...

2578
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:43,880
I was not expecting that.

2579
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:47,080
This?

2580
01:52:47,460 --> 01:52:47,840
Nice.

2581
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:52,420
Oh.

2582
01:52:52,900 --> 01:52:53,320
Okay.

2583
01:52:53,660 --> 01:52:56,640
I am in this room that has nothing.

2584
01:52:58,360 --> 01:52:59,560
What is this room for?

2585
01:53:01,260 --> 01:53:02,260
I have a gourd.

2586
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:06,480
Okay, nothing else.

2587
01:53:07,460 --> 01:53:08,640
Does he not do anything?

2588
01:53:08,980 --> 01:53:09,960
What do you do?

2589
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:11,140
Sir!

2590
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:14,220
What is this room for?

2591
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:15,980
Sir!

2592
01:53:18,780 --> 01:53:20,160
What is the gourd for?

2593
01:53:22,820 --> 01:53:23,600
Wait, what?

2594
01:53:23,940 --> 01:53:25,000
Oh, is it equipment?

2595
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:25,540
No.

2596
01:53:31,110 --> 01:53:32,710
Wait, where the fuck is it?

2597
01:53:35,270 --> 01:53:36,710
It's not in my equipment.

2598
01:53:37,050 --> 01:53:37,830
I swear to god.

2599
01:53:38,030 --> 01:53:39,350
It's a fucking gift.

2600
01:53:39,610 --> 01:53:39,990
I...

2601
01:53:39,990 --> 01:53:42,190
I'm not even gonna see him.

2602
01:53:42,570 --> 01:53:44,310
Like, when will I see him?

2603
01:53:48,630 --> 01:53:50,190
I can't believe it.

2604
01:53:53,240 --> 01:53:57,840
Like, I haven't seen him once because I fucking couldn't do that mission.

2605
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:03,980
Oh, left side of the room to go in deeper?

2606
01:54:04,240 --> 01:54:05,620
Wait, there's a little end...

2607
01:54:05,620 --> 01:54:06,300
Wait, there is.

2608
01:54:08,040 --> 01:54:09,480
Wait, there's something behind.

2609
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:10,980
He missed.

2610
01:54:10,980 --> 01:54:11,320
Haha.

2611
01:54:14,220 --> 01:54:14,740
Oh!

2612
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:17,060
Oh my god, it's...

2613
01:54:18,100 --> 01:54:18,660
Alright.

2614
01:54:19,220 --> 01:54:21,000
Time to go into the special hole.

2615
01:54:21,600 --> 01:54:22,680
Oh, oh, nice.

2616
01:54:22,940 --> 01:54:23,580
Oh, thank god.

2617
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:27,100
I got a little worried about my special hole.

2618
01:54:30,300 --> 01:54:30,860
Alright.

2619
01:54:31,380 --> 01:54:32,420
We'll upgrade this.

2620
01:54:34,060 --> 01:54:35,680
I got a little worried there.

2621
01:54:36,020 --> 01:54:38,740
That it might be dangerous in my special hole.

2622
01:54:40,380 --> 01:54:41,620
Wait, where am I?

2623
01:54:43,600 --> 01:54:44,880
Wait, where is the...

2624
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:45,880
What is this area?

2625
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:48,140
Oh, medicine!

2626
01:54:48,500 --> 01:54:48,780
Nice.

2627
01:54:50,640 --> 01:54:51,760
This person...

2628
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:53,040
Is supposed to have done this...

2629
01:54:53,380 --> 01:54:55,020
To everyone who tried to get away.

2630
01:54:55,960 --> 01:54:57,200
Oh, what's in here?

2631
01:54:58,220 --> 01:54:58,780
What?

2632
01:55:01,620 --> 01:55:03,360
Wait, I can't even get past him.

2633
01:55:04,660 --> 01:55:05,640
What's the point?

2634
01:55:06,820 --> 01:55:07,940
I can't...

2635
01:55:07,940 --> 01:55:08,800
No!

2636
01:55:09,240 --> 01:55:10,480
He's blocked me!

2637
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,800
I can't believe it!

2638
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:17,260
I can't just walk to the side!

2639
01:55:17,700 --> 01:55:18,800
Wait, can I kill him?

2640
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:21,160
Body block.

2641
01:55:22,660 --> 01:55:23,920
Oh, I can't.

2642
01:55:28,140 --> 01:55:29,040
That ash...

2643
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:29,820
Okay, there's the other way.

2644
01:55:30,060 --> 01:55:30,900
Okay, there's the other way.

2645
01:55:31,100 --> 01:55:31,560
Thank god.

2646
01:55:32,780 --> 01:55:34,580
I was gonna say, like...

2647
01:55:34,580 --> 01:55:35,080
What?

2648
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:37,220
Like, they blocked...

2649
01:55:37,220 --> 01:55:38,460
Like, what was the point of being here?

2650
01:55:38,540 --> 01:55:40,080
They're just gonna block the entrance.

2651
01:55:41,540 --> 01:55:42,560
There's another hole.

2652
01:55:43,780 --> 01:55:45,380
There's another special hole.

2653
01:55:46,900 --> 01:55:48,400
What do I get out of this?

2654
01:55:55,530 --> 01:55:56,510
You know what they say?

2655
01:55:56,750 --> 01:55:58,790
There's always more than one special hole.

2656
01:56:04,670 --> 01:56:05,210
Oh, hey.

2657
01:56:06,010 --> 01:56:07,390
I'll just use magic first.

2658
01:56:07,990 --> 01:56:08,930
Oh, I don't want magic!

2659
01:56:10,110 --> 01:56:11,410
I was, like, spamming it.

2660
01:56:11,470 --> 01:56:12,770
I was like, hmm, why isn't it working?

2661
01:56:17,510 --> 01:56:18,310
Oh, nice.

2662
01:56:22,550 --> 01:56:22,950
Okay.

2663
01:56:23,810 --> 01:56:25,210
Get rid of this guy first.

2664
01:56:28,210 --> 01:56:28,610
Alright.

2665
01:56:29,930 --> 01:56:30,910
Are you serious?

2666
01:56:34,570 --> 01:56:35,370
Okay, nice.

2667
01:56:36,610 --> 01:56:38,230
Gotta make sure I get that first.

2668
01:56:40,430 --> 01:56:40,830
No!

2669
01:56:44,470 --> 01:56:44,870
No!

2670
01:56:45,030 --> 01:56:45,390
Oh my god!

2671
01:56:45,530 --> 01:56:46,630
Oh my god, he tried to do a kick.

2672
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:52,820
Oh my god, I hate these guys so much.

2673
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:55,540
I fucking hate these guys so much!

2674
01:56:59,550 --> 01:56:59,910
Okay.

2675
01:57:01,330 --> 01:57:03,710
At least it gave me a little bit of HP, thank god.

2676
01:57:08,190 --> 01:57:12,670
I hate that it, like, randomly locks, so I can't do, like, the finishing blow.

2677
01:57:13,410 --> 01:57:15,270
Like, like, what the fuck is this bullshit?!

2678
01:57:20,050 --> 01:57:20,570
I can't do this bullshit.

2679
01:57:23,010 --> 01:57:23,530
Okay.

2680
01:57:23,810 --> 01:57:24,350
Fuck this.

2681
01:57:24,590 --> 01:57:25,450
I can't be bothered.

2682
01:57:28,130 --> 01:57:29,470
Actually, cannot be bothered.

2683
01:57:34,660 --> 01:57:35,720
I know I have time.

2684
01:57:38,240 --> 01:57:39,440
I know I have time!

2685
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:41,420
To do an extra suck!

2686
01:57:46,900 --> 01:57:49,820
I feel like there's a boss battle right here.

2687
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:52,100
I don't know.

2688
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:54,480
It just, it just feels so boss battle-y.

2689
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:59,300
Okay, I'm just gonna get rid of this guy first, before I do anything.

2690
01:58:02,780 --> 01:58:03,220
What?!

2691
01:58:03,220 --> 01:58:03,980
That's fine.

2692
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:05,380
That's not fine.

2693
01:58:06,360 --> 01:58:07,080
Never mind!

2694
01:58:07,740 --> 01:58:09,700
I don't feel as fine no more!

2695
01:58:10,060 --> 01:58:10,820
Wait, I have one more.

2696
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:11,340
Where am I?

2697
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:12,920
I have one more for this.

2698
01:58:13,100 --> 01:58:13,460
That's good.

2699
01:58:14,260 --> 01:58:14,760
Go!

2700
01:58:16,700 --> 01:58:17,400
There we go.

2701
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:22,660
Okay.

2702
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:23,740
Where do I go?

2703
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:26,520
There's something here.

2704
01:58:28,100 --> 01:58:29,720
I wanna go over here first.

2705
01:58:30,580 --> 01:58:31,340
Alright, never mind.

2706
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:32,480
That was just a dead end.

2707
01:58:33,060 --> 01:58:33,460
Cool.

2708
01:58:36,260 --> 01:58:37,340
I just got lazy.

2709
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:41,600
Alright, nice.

2710
01:58:42,920 --> 01:58:43,820
No, there's a dead end.

2711
01:58:43,900 --> 01:58:44,100
See?

2712
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:46,300
Look.

2713
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:47,240
Nothing here.

2714
01:58:48,760 --> 01:58:49,700
A wall!

2715
01:58:51,020 --> 01:58:52,080
What's over there?

2716
01:58:55,600 --> 01:58:59,320
That is weird, because it's just a random indent in the wall.

2717
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:01,320
Oh no.

2718
01:59:01,700 --> 01:59:03,540
He's slowly walking up to me.

2719
01:59:06,680 --> 01:59:07,240
Okay.

2720
01:59:07,540 --> 01:59:08,360
I should have enough.

2721
01:59:08,540 --> 01:59:08,800
Yes.

2722
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:13,300
Like, I cannot be bothered to kill these guys normally.

2723
01:59:13,720 --> 01:59:15,960
These guys are way too annoying to be killed normally.

2724
01:59:20,640 --> 01:59:21,660
Alright, get out of here.

2725
01:59:25,710 --> 01:59:26,080
Okay.

2726
01:59:28,470 --> 01:59:29,120
Get out!

2727
01:59:29,790 --> 01:59:30,760
Get out of here!

2728
01:59:35,150 --> 01:59:36,800
You mean nothing to me!

2729
01:59:39,230 --> 01:59:41,020
You're just easy fodder!

2730
01:59:41,720 --> 01:59:43,340
To pat the game time!

2731
01:59:43,800 --> 01:59:43,840
To pat the game time!

2732
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:44,780
That's right, I said it!

2733
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:47,120
You're just game time patters!

2734
01:59:47,700 --> 01:59:48,900
You're no challenge!

2735
01:59:50,180 --> 01:59:51,000
You're just going...

2736
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:52,740
You're just here to be a little bit annoying!

2737
01:59:59,990 --> 02:00:01,110
Alright, where am I?

2738
02:00:01,110 --> 02:00:03,070
Am I supposed to like...

2739
02:00:03,070 --> 02:00:04,430
Oh my god, not you!

2740
02:00:05,030 --> 02:00:05,810
Not you!

2741
02:00:06,430 --> 02:00:07,390
Not you!

2742
02:00:09,070 --> 02:00:10,950
God, I hate these guys so much.

2743
02:00:13,350 --> 02:00:14,330
Nice, okay.

2744
02:00:17,230 --> 02:00:18,950
Let me get rid of him first.

2745
02:00:22,840 --> 02:00:23,480
Alright.

2746
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:28,780
It's nice that I can just use my magic for it.

2747
02:00:29,080 --> 02:00:30,400
And not to worry too much.

2748
02:00:33,670 --> 02:00:34,790
Get out of here!

2749
02:00:36,810 --> 02:00:38,210
Oh my god, please.

2750
02:00:38,530 --> 02:00:40,290
Please, open your eyes.

2751
02:00:40,490 --> 02:00:41,870
Wear glasses or something!

2752
02:00:42,250 --> 02:00:43,890
Please, it was right there!

2753
02:00:44,050 --> 02:00:45,010
How could I miss?

2754
02:00:47,530 --> 02:00:48,050
Alright.

2755
02:00:49,070 --> 02:00:50,590
Down the bridge I go.

2756
02:00:54,330 --> 02:00:54,930
Down the bridge I go.

2757
02:00:56,470 --> 02:00:56,810
Yay!

2758
02:01:02,280 --> 02:01:03,140
Wait, what?

2759
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:04,900
What's up on the other side?

2760
02:01:06,280 --> 02:01:07,400
Oh my god.

2761
02:01:07,820 --> 02:01:09,280
Here to pad more of my time.

2762
02:01:11,160 --> 02:01:12,380
Oh, thank god.

2763
02:01:12,540 --> 02:01:14,580
You didn't auto-lock to the other guy.

2764
02:01:14,940 --> 02:01:16,060
Oh my god.

2765
02:01:16,060 --> 02:01:17,460
It's a Christmas miracle.

2766
02:01:21,030 --> 02:01:22,710
You're lucky I need XP.

2767
02:01:25,810 --> 02:01:27,050
Oh my god.

2768
02:01:27,230 --> 02:01:27,870
Get over here.

2769
02:01:28,030 --> 02:01:28,650
I heard you.

2770
02:01:29,210 --> 02:01:30,210
Give me my XP.

2771
02:01:33,470 --> 02:01:34,150
That's right.

2772
02:01:34,330 --> 02:01:35,910
You thought I wouldn't walk back?

2773
02:01:39,900 --> 02:01:40,420
Wait.

2774
02:01:40,900 --> 02:01:41,560
I'm here.

2775
02:01:42,940 --> 02:01:43,460
What?

2776
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:45,600
Oh no.

2777
02:01:45,660 --> 02:01:46,400
This is a new area.

2778
02:01:46,600 --> 02:01:47,480
I was gonna say, like...

2779
02:01:48,120 --> 02:01:48,980
Was I just here?

2780
02:01:51,020 --> 02:01:52,440
Everything just looks the same.

2781
02:01:55,180 --> 02:01:56,760
Alright, Max does this.

2782
02:01:58,080 --> 02:01:59,740
Does she know she takes this damage?

2783
02:01:59,940 --> 02:02:00,280
I do.

2784
02:02:00,500 --> 02:02:01,140
But, like...

2785
02:02:01,140 --> 02:02:03,640
As long as I don't get hit, it should be fine.

2786
02:02:04,220 --> 02:02:04,540
Like...

2787
02:02:05,800 --> 02:02:08,260
We're going with the just don't get hit strat.

2788
02:02:10,380 --> 02:02:17,280
The petrification bullet that Guildenstern created is an absolute astounding weapon.

2789
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:27,400
Anyone who is hit by this bullet becomes frozen like a stone statue, and they can easily be crushed into pieces and scattered, or that they can be displayed like a nice ornament.

2790
02:02:27,780 --> 02:02:35,360
As a precaution, Guildenstern created the Great Powder to counteract a bullet's effect, which she stored inside a bamboo too.

2791
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:39,080
There's nothing to interfere with a weapon this magnificent.

2792
02:02:39,080 --> 02:02:41,440
Now, to start mass production.

2793
02:02:41,800 --> 02:02:43,420
Wait, that doesn't sound very...

2794
02:02:43,420 --> 02:02:44,200
Very nice.

2795
02:02:45,620 --> 02:02:46,840
Wait a minute.

2796
02:02:47,940 --> 02:02:49,700
Oh, it's a demon cave.

2797
02:02:49,940 --> 02:02:50,680
That sounds right.

2798
02:02:51,960 --> 02:02:54,640
How the fuck do I open that box?

2799
02:02:59,280 --> 02:03:00,100
Don't worry.

2800
02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:01,680
I'll never get hit.

2801
02:03:02,300 --> 02:03:04,420
I have magic by my side.

2802
02:03:07,300 --> 02:03:07,900
Whoa!

2803
02:03:08,680 --> 02:03:09,600
Ha-ha!

2804
02:03:10,100 --> 02:03:10,980
Told you.

2805
02:03:11,220 --> 02:03:12,340
Didn't get hit.

2806
02:03:16,260 --> 02:03:18,880
Jesus fucking Christ, not these guys again.

2807
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:23,200
Get out of here!

2808
02:03:29,120 --> 02:03:30,580
It punched me!

2809
02:03:40,590 --> 02:03:41,510
I'm done.

2810
02:03:43,870 --> 02:03:45,710
Okay, that doesn't count, guys.

2811
02:03:46,110 --> 02:03:47,290
That doesn't count.

2812
02:03:48,710 --> 02:03:49,350
That...

2813
02:03:50,150 --> 02:03:52,110
That was absolutely bullshit.

2814
02:03:52,110 --> 02:03:52,910
I...

2815
02:03:52,910 --> 02:03:54,190
I don't count those.

2816
02:03:54,350 --> 02:03:55,590
We don't count those.

2817
02:03:55,750 --> 02:03:57,170
We don't count...

2818
02:03:57,170 --> 02:03:58,190
Oh, shit!

2819
02:03:58,990 --> 02:04:00,230
Oh, my God!

2820
02:04:01,910 --> 02:04:04,410
Where the fuck is this?

2821
02:04:07,770 --> 02:04:10,970
I like how I say that, and then I just get hit by...

2822
02:04:10,970 --> 02:04:13,850
Everything that could hit me just hit me there.

2823
02:04:14,310 --> 02:04:15,030
Like...

2824
02:04:15,790 --> 02:04:16,630
That's crazy.

2825
02:04:17,270 --> 02:04:21,230
Like, legitimately everything that hit me.

2826
02:04:21,830 --> 02:04:23,370
How, like, unlucky am I?

2827
02:04:24,590 --> 02:04:26,570
I don't get karma'd like that.

2828
02:04:27,010 --> 02:04:27,850
The fear!

2829
02:04:32,140 --> 02:04:35,020
All right, that's fine, we're still very much alive.

2830
02:04:37,240 --> 02:04:39,800
We're almost, we almost looped the looped back.

2831
02:04:40,380 --> 02:04:41,780
Oh, that looks like a boss fight.

2832
02:04:41,780 --> 02:04:42,420
Oh, fuck!

2833
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:46,440
Okay.

2834
02:04:48,280 --> 02:04:50,680
Okay, that was a boss fight.

2835
02:04:51,100 --> 02:04:51,620
Whoa.

2836
02:04:52,680 --> 02:04:54,940
I was like, hey, that looks very dick.

2837
02:04:55,060 --> 02:04:57,020
That looks like people will be there.

2838
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:02,100
Who would have, who would have thought there were people there?

2839
02:05:04,120 --> 02:05:05,260
I'll help you.

2840
02:05:05,620 --> 02:05:06,460
What?!

2841
02:05:06,460 --> 02:05:07,860
That, bro!

2842
02:05:10,580 --> 02:05:13,480
Oh, now you'll help me.

2843
02:05:14,160 --> 02:05:16,120
Oh my, thanks, girl.

2844
02:05:16,600 --> 02:05:17,360
Thanks.

2845
02:05:17,640 --> 02:05:20,540
I really appreciate the help.

2846
02:05:21,500 --> 02:05:25,300
I really appreciate that.

2847
02:05:25,880 --> 02:05:26,740
Thanks for the help.

2848
02:05:27,160 --> 02:05:27,640
Wow.

2849
02:05:28,100 --> 02:05:28,920
Great help.

2850
02:05:29,340 --> 02:05:29,920
Great help.

2851
02:05:30,380 --> 02:05:30,820
Wow.

2852
02:05:31,660 --> 02:05:32,780
Thanks, girl.

2853
02:05:36,240 --> 02:05:38,620
It was, it was so helpful.

2854
02:05:39,040 --> 02:05:40,920
Oh, so very helpful.

2855
02:05:45,220 --> 02:05:48,380
You better be behind me when I, oh, there she, she's gone.

2856
02:05:48,680 --> 02:05:49,460
She's gone.

2857
02:05:49,980 --> 02:05:52,160
As she's, she's already gone.

2858
02:05:57,880 --> 02:06:00,060
Truly, the most helpful.

2859
02:06:01,720 --> 02:06:02,820
Appreciate it.

2860
02:06:06,830 --> 02:06:09,570
Oh my, what could I have done without her?

2861
02:06:09,970 --> 02:06:10,310
Honestly.

2862
02:06:11,230 --> 02:06:11,410
What?

2863
02:06:15,370 --> 02:06:17,010
Oh my god.

2864
02:06:18,930 --> 02:06:21,650
What would I do without that woman?

2865
02:06:27,820 --> 02:06:28,980
Fuck this.

2866
02:06:29,160 --> 02:06:29,820
I'm done.

2867
02:06:30,720 --> 02:06:32,060
I'm so done.

2868
02:06:35,020 --> 02:06:35,820
Okay.

2869
02:06:41,670 --> 02:06:43,110
Get over here.

2870
02:06:49,860 --> 02:06:52,040
Alright, now this looks like a boss fight.

2871
02:06:52,260 --> 02:06:52,840
Oh, I got an herb.

2872
02:06:53,060 --> 02:06:53,240
Nice.

2873
02:06:55,680 --> 02:06:56,360
Oh, nice.

2874
02:06:56,480 --> 02:06:56,980
Another box.

2875
02:06:57,940 --> 02:06:58,340
Okay.

2876
02:06:58,860 --> 02:06:59,900
We got this.

2877
02:07:00,220 --> 02:07:02,720
You've been training your whole life for this moment.

2878
02:07:06,120 --> 02:07:08,360
Okay, now this is a little more difficult.

2879
02:07:18,470 --> 02:07:19,030
Okay.

2880
02:07:20,330 --> 02:07:21,190
Oh, no.

2881
02:07:21,330 --> 02:07:22,010
Now it's five.

2882
02:07:22,330 --> 02:07:22,970
Oh my god.

2883
02:07:22,990 --> 02:07:23,970
It's more than three.

2884
02:07:25,270 --> 02:07:27,010
Guys, this is more than three.

2885
02:07:33,220 --> 02:07:34,180
Oh, no.

2886
02:07:44,940 --> 02:07:45,900
Oh, no.

2887
02:07:46,520 --> 02:07:47,360
Oh, no.

2888
02:08:01,640 --> 02:08:02,440
Oh, no.

2889
02:08:03,220 --> 02:08:03,900
Not again.

2890
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:05,200
Not again.

2891
02:08:05,720 --> 02:08:06,340
No.

2892
02:08:06,780 --> 02:08:08,220
I thought I was freed.

2893
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:08,940
Why?

2894
02:08:09,680 --> 02:08:09,960
Okay.

2895
02:08:10,380 --> 02:08:11,380
Not again.

2896
02:08:12,300 --> 02:08:14,060
When will this end?

2897
02:08:34,760 --> 02:08:36,220
I made nothing.

2898
02:08:43,350 --> 02:08:44,610
Wait, I remember.

2899
02:08:45,110 --> 02:08:45,790
Wait.

2900
02:08:46,010 --> 02:08:47,490
No, this is exactly what you're right.

2901
02:08:49,330 --> 02:08:51,230
How did I do it last time?

2902
02:08:51,730 --> 02:08:52,790
How did...

2903
02:08:56,010 --> 02:08:57,170
How did I...

2904
02:08:57,170 --> 02:09:00,690
I didn't think I have to come back to it, guys.

2905
02:09:01,450 --> 02:09:02,230
How did I...

2906
02:09:02,230 --> 02:09:04,590
I didn't think I have to come back.

2907
02:09:06,530 --> 02:09:07,570
Johnny again.

2908
02:09:07,830 --> 02:09:09,090
Thank you for the super chat.

2909
02:09:09,290 --> 02:09:09,570
Thank you.

2910
02:09:09,730 --> 02:09:10,230
Thank you.

2911
02:09:10,410 --> 02:09:12,670
I didn't think we'd come back.

2912
02:09:15,810 --> 02:09:18,350
He'll do it again eventually.

2913
02:09:18,870 --> 02:09:20,310
I thought it was over.

2914
02:09:22,950 --> 02:09:25,450
Nobody told me it never ended.

2915
02:09:26,490 --> 02:09:28,330
I was like this.

2916
02:09:29,170 --> 02:09:32,550
And then... Then what did I do?

2917
02:09:32,890 --> 02:09:34,030
What did I do?

2918
02:09:34,370 --> 02:09:36,050
I don't fucking remember.

2919
02:09:36,310 --> 02:09:37,490
I don't remember.

2920
02:09:41,730 --> 02:09:42,990
It was like this.

2921
02:09:43,490 --> 02:09:45,210
And then what did I do?

2922
02:09:47,330 --> 02:09:49,090
How did I do this?

2923
02:09:59,650 --> 02:10:00,490
I don't know.

2924
02:10:00,750 --> 02:10:01,750
I don't know.

2925
02:10:02,010 --> 02:10:05,550
I don't... Oh

2926
02:10:17,570 --> 02:10:17,890
my god.

2927
02:10:18,030 --> 02:10:18,710
What the fuck?

2928
02:10:19,150 --> 02:10:21,450
I don't... How did I get you up there?

2929
02:10:31,820 --> 02:10:32,860
Oh my god.

2930
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:37,340
Is that at least... Okay.

2931
02:10:37,600 --> 02:10:38,380
Just tell me this.

2932
02:10:38,380 --> 02:10:40,980
Is the first move at least correct?

2933
02:10:41,360 --> 02:10:43,880
Like that's like... I don't ask for much.

2934
02:10:44,360 --> 02:10:45,180
Just the little things.

2935
02:10:45,400 --> 02:10:48,080
I just... Is the first move at least correct?

2936
02:10:48,340 --> 02:10:50,400
Like that's like...

2937
02:10:54,160 --> 02:10:54,840
No!

2938
02:10:54,840 --> 02:10:55,520
Okay.

2939
02:10:56,260 --> 02:10:56,640
Okay.

2940
02:10:57,360 --> 02:10:58,600
Then maybe it's like this.

2941
02:11:02,340 --> 02:11:06,920
And then I recreated that... I recreated that moment.

2942
02:11:07,540 --> 02:11:09,580
I recreated it.

2943
02:11:18,640 --> 02:11:19,920
Oh my god.

2944
02:11:22,300 --> 02:11:22,840
Oh my god.

2945
02:11:22,840 --> 02:11:22,840
Okay.

2946
02:11:23,040 --> 02:11:24,600
This has to be the first move then.

2947
02:11:26,640 --> 02:11:27,440
Oh my god.

2948
02:11:27,560 --> 02:11:28,220
I did it again.

2949
02:11:28,500 --> 02:11:29,820
Why do I keep making it?

2950
02:11:30,060 --> 02:11:31,020
Why do...

2951
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,400
Why do I keep making that move?

2952
02:11:43,660 --> 02:11:44,220
Okay.

2953
02:11:44,880 --> 02:11:45,440
Alright.

2954
02:11:45,700 --> 02:11:46,740
This is the correct move.

2955
02:11:48,420 --> 02:11:49,740
And then I did it again.

2956
02:11:49,920 --> 02:11:51,600
I keep doing the same thing.

2957
02:11:51,960 --> 02:11:53,380
It just looks so right.

2958
02:11:53,380 --> 02:11:53,420
Why?

2959
02:11:56,380 --> 02:11:58,080
I can't help it.

2960
02:11:58,180 --> 02:11:59,420
It looks so correct.

2961
02:12:15,750 --> 02:12:16,710
Then what?

2962
02:12:20,190 --> 02:12:21,070
Oh my god.

2963
02:12:21,230 --> 02:12:21,810
I did it again.

2964
02:12:22,170 --> 02:12:23,310
I never learned.

2965
02:12:23,910 --> 02:12:25,390
I keep doing it.

2966
02:12:25,930 --> 02:12:27,550
I keep doing this.

2967
02:12:27,830 --> 02:12:30,010
I keep... I keep doing it.

2968
02:12:34,810 --> 02:12:36,290
I just don't learn.

2969
02:12:43,600 --> 02:12:44,580
Oh my god.

2970
02:12:44,740 --> 02:12:44,740
Oh my god.

2971
02:12:44,740 --> 02:12:45,100
I did it.

2972
02:12:45,200 --> 02:12:46,120
I did it.

2973
02:12:46,340 --> 02:12:48,120
I finally broke the cycle.

2974
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:50,240
Guys, I broke the cycle.

2975
02:12:50,400 --> 02:12:51,540
I finally did it.

2976
02:12:51,900 --> 02:12:54,620
I broke the cycle and I did a new move.

2977
02:12:58,430 --> 02:12:59,070
Wait.

2978
02:12:59,110 --> 02:12:59,730
That's it?

2979
02:13:00,770 --> 02:13:02,750
There was nothing else here?

2980
02:13:04,170 --> 02:13:05,150
That's it?

2981
02:13:12,530 --> 02:13:12,930
What?

2982
02:13:12,930 --> 02:13:13,110
Oh wait.

2983
02:13:13,210 --> 02:13:14,030
I could have just used this.

2984
02:13:14,090 --> 02:13:14,450
What the fuck?

2985
02:13:14,450 --> 02:13:14,970
Why am I doing?

2986
02:13:20,460 --> 02:13:21,140
Oh my god.

2987
02:13:21,180 --> 02:13:22,880
I didn't even realize I could have just used that.

2988
02:13:26,040 --> 02:13:26,440
Oh!

2989
02:13:26,840 --> 02:13:27,040
Wait.

2990
02:13:27,120 --> 02:13:28,040
I needed the grape powder?

2991
02:13:28,280 --> 02:13:28,640
Oh!

2992
02:13:29,040 --> 02:13:30,640
I forgot about the grape powder.

2993
02:13:31,940 --> 02:13:32,740
Where is it?

2994
02:13:33,440 --> 02:13:35,400
But where am I supposed to give that to?

2995
02:13:38,560 --> 02:13:38,960
Oh!

2996
02:13:39,160 --> 02:13:40,240
I can save them!

2997
02:13:40,440 --> 02:13:40,600
Oh!

2998
02:13:40,780 --> 02:13:41,760
I can save them!

2999
02:13:42,540 --> 02:13:43,460
Don't worry, sir.

3000
02:13:44,160 --> 02:13:44,980
I'm a hero.

3001
02:13:50,090 --> 02:13:51,210
I got you, bro!

3002
02:13:53,650 --> 02:13:54,010
Boom.

3003
02:13:54,170 --> 02:13:54,430
You're here.

3004
02:13:54,550 --> 02:13:55,590
Oh, by the way, I found these before.

3005
02:13:55,710 --> 02:13:55,870
Yay!

3006
02:13:56,530 --> 02:13:56,750
Oh!

3007
02:13:57,030 --> 02:13:57,890
I can get free stuff!

3008
02:14:00,150 --> 02:14:00,970
I'm a hero!

3009
02:14:05,580 --> 02:14:06,200
Oh my god.

3010
02:14:06,320 --> 02:14:07,420
I keep pressing cancel.

3011
02:14:11,360 --> 02:14:11,720
Alright.

3012
02:14:12,100 --> 02:14:12,260
Wait.

3013
02:14:12,340 --> 02:14:13,440
You don't have anything for me?

3014
02:14:15,240 --> 02:14:15,600
Wait.

3015
02:14:15,620 --> 02:14:16,800
What's the point of saving you?

3016
02:14:17,840 --> 02:14:18,280
Wait.

3017
02:14:18,420 --> 02:14:20,240
If you don't have items, why would I save you?

3018
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:23,200
To be a good person?

3019
02:14:23,440 --> 02:14:23,560
Okay.

3020
02:14:23,780 --> 02:14:24,760
But like...

3021
02:14:25,660 --> 02:14:28,760
I only be a... I'm only a good person if I get something.

3022
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:32,400
End game.

3023
02:14:32,580 --> 02:14:32,960
End game.

3024
02:14:33,140 --> 02:14:33,480
End game.

3025
02:14:33,860 --> 02:14:34,300
Why...

3026
02:14:39,780 --> 02:14:41,760
I am a hero for hire.

3027
02:14:42,740 --> 02:14:43,660
Oh, whoa.

3028
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:44,440
Doki.

3029
02:14:48,780 --> 02:14:49,900
I'm forced to work here.

3030
02:14:49,940 --> 02:14:51,340
And this place gives me the creeps.

3031
02:14:51,460 --> 02:14:52,980
And the skin on my hands peeled off.

3032
02:14:53,260 --> 02:14:54,160
And so I can hold my...

3033
02:14:54,160 --> 02:14:58,000
Some weird monkey-like man told me I'd outlive my usefulness.

3034
02:14:58,160 --> 02:15:00,200
And before I knew it, everything went dark.

3035
02:15:00,480 --> 02:15:01,920
I don't remember anything after that.

3036
02:15:02,020 --> 02:15:03,340
Guys, I'm a bounty hunter.

3037
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:04,500
Of course I...

3038
02:15:04,500 --> 02:15:06,060
Do good things for pay.

3039
02:15:09,060 --> 02:15:09,420
Okay.

3040
02:15:09,420 --> 02:15:10,640
I found something really nice today.

3041
02:15:11,320 --> 02:15:12,720
I found something really nice, but like...

3042
02:15:12,720 --> 02:15:13,400
I'm on my side today.

3043
02:15:13,820 --> 02:15:16,120
I was gonna use this later, but my partner would just get angry.

3044
02:15:16,280 --> 02:15:17,040
So I'll give it to you.

3045
02:15:17,480 --> 02:15:18,400
Don't tell them, okay?

3046
02:15:19,680 --> 02:15:20,220
Oh, yay!

3047
02:15:20,360 --> 02:15:20,600
Medicine!

3048
02:15:20,980 --> 02:15:21,540
Okay, nice.

3049
02:15:22,940 --> 02:15:23,620
All of them?

3050
02:15:24,500 --> 02:15:25,720
Is there any more over here?

3051
02:15:25,740 --> 02:15:27,080
I don't remember if there's any of...

3052
02:15:28,140 --> 02:15:28,500
Like...

3053
02:15:28,880 --> 02:15:29,900
Stone guys here.

3054
02:15:30,060 --> 02:15:30,260
No.

3055
02:15:30,420 --> 02:15:31,080
Okay, let's leave.

3056
02:15:31,080 --> 02:15:33,000
Alright, that should be all of them.

3057
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:36,040
Okay.

3058
02:15:36,620 --> 02:15:37,820
Oh, they all left too.

3059
02:15:38,680 --> 02:15:39,620
Wait, there's one more?

3060
02:15:39,900 --> 02:15:40,880
Where's the last guy?

3061
02:15:46,930 --> 02:15:48,950
He's at the middle of the map?!

3062
02:15:49,530 --> 02:15:50,430
Oh my god.

3063
02:15:53,370 --> 02:15:53,890
Okay.

3064
02:15:55,550 --> 02:15:56,510
Like, do I...

3065
02:15:56,510 --> 02:15:57,310
Should I go like...

3066
02:15:57,310 --> 02:15:58,430
Should I go like...

3067
02:15:58,430 --> 02:15:58,790
Behind?

3068
02:15:59,370 --> 02:16:00,370
From the behind?

3069
02:16:00,630 --> 02:16:01,450
Or should I just...

3070
02:16:01,450 --> 02:16:02,190
Run this way?

3071
02:16:02,990 --> 02:16:03,870
Where is he?

3072
02:16:09,830 --> 02:16:10,790
Do I go like...

3073
02:16:10,790 --> 02:16:11,630
Where I'm going right now?

3074
02:16:11,730 --> 02:16:12,230
Is it closer?

3075
02:16:14,990 --> 02:16:16,710
Is where I'm going closer, chat?

3076
02:16:18,430 --> 02:16:19,210
Okay, good.

3077
02:16:20,930 --> 02:16:23,010
See, this is why I need back seaters.

3078
02:16:28,890 --> 02:16:29,330
Okay.

3079
02:16:29,690 --> 02:16:30,410
Get out of here.

3080
02:16:32,170 --> 02:16:33,610
You guys are all useless.

3081
02:16:34,210 --> 02:16:35,110
Get out of here.

3082
02:16:41,740 --> 02:16:42,660
Oh my god.

3083
02:16:43,880 --> 02:16:44,600
Oh my god.

3084
02:16:44,740 --> 02:16:44,800
Oh my god.

3085
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:44,860
Oh my god.

3086
02:16:44,860 --> 02:16:45,360
Guarded in time.

3087
02:16:46,100 --> 02:16:48,100
I was worried that it was going to hit me there.

3088
02:16:51,580 --> 02:16:52,460
Very slowly.

3089
02:16:52,700 --> 02:16:53,480
Suck that up.

3090
02:16:54,660 --> 02:16:55,260
Yeah, I saved.

3091
02:16:55,520 --> 02:16:55,940
Don't worry.

3092
02:16:56,220 --> 02:16:57,880
That was the first thing I did.

3093
02:16:59,020 --> 02:17:00,400
I made sure of it.

3094
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:03,720
Okay.

3095
02:17:03,780 --> 02:17:04,920
Where is the last guy?

3096
02:17:05,100 --> 02:17:05,620
Is he here?

3097
02:17:06,800 --> 02:17:07,780
Where is he?

3098
02:17:13,050 --> 02:17:14,330
I'm gonna use the sword.

3099
02:17:14,970 --> 02:17:16,050
Oh, after this room?

3100
02:17:16,130 --> 02:17:16,350
Okay.

3101
02:17:16,570 --> 02:17:17,850
I'll just grab some XP then.

3102
02:17:20,030 --> 02:17:21,070
I'll just...

3103
02:17:21,070 --> 02:17:22,130
Kill the...

3104
02:17:22,650 --> 02:17:25,010
Kill the enemies that hear the pad time.

3105
02:17:26,590 --> 02:17:27,570
Get over here.

3106
02:17:27,570 --> 02:17:30,310
Your purpose is to give me XP!

3107
02:17:33,390 --> 02:17:34,230
That's right.

3108
02:17:34,930 --> 02:17:36,290
That is your purpose.

3109
02:17:36,670 --> 02:17:37,450
Okay, not you though.

3110
02:17:37,690 --> 02:17:39,010
Okay, you're actually scary.

3111
02:17:42,310 --> 02:17:44,030
You actually have worth.

3112
02:17:46,250 --> 02:17:47,370
Uh, nah.

3113
02:17:47,970 --> 02:17:48,750
Not worth it.

3114
02:17:51,090 --> 02:17:52,250
Wait, where is he?

3115
02:17:54,150 --> 02:17:55,410
Wait, did you guys lie?

3116
02:17:55,750 --> 02:17:56,710
Where is he?

3117
02:17:59,570 --> 02:18:00,550
Is he like...

3118
02:18:00,550 --> 02:18:01,350
All over here?

3119
02:18:03,330 --> 02:18:04,650
Where the fuck is this guy?

3120
02:18:05,030 --> 02:18:06,210
Oh, after this bridge?

3121
02:18:06,370 --> 02:18:07,050
I swear to god.

3122
02:18:07,170 --> 02:18:08,230
If this is like the...

3123
02:18:08,230 --> 02:18:09,330
Plus five shit again.

3124
02:18:09,410 --> 02:18:10,510
I swear to fucking god.

3125
02:18:10,930 --> 02:18:11,210
I...

3126
02:18:14,250 --> 02:18:15,290
I'm this close.

3127
02:18:15,730 --> 02:18:17,030
I'm this close, guys.

3128
02:18:23,300 --> 02:18:24,220
I'm like, okay.

3129
02:18:24,360 --> 02:18:24,900
You guys are...

3130
02:18:24,900 --> 02:18:25,420
You're so lucky.

3131
02:18:25,560 --> 02:18:27,220
You're so lucky you're actually here.

3132
02:18:32,780 --> 02:18:33,840
I tried to escape.

3133
02:18:34,200 --> 02:18:35,060
I couldn't even move.

3134
02:18:35,260 --> 02:18:36,440
I almost wet my pants.

3135
02:18:36,700 --> 02:18:37,880
It's a good thing I didn't.

3136
02:18:38,040 --> 02:18:40,220
Or this thing I put in my pocket would have been soaked.

3137
02:18:40,860 --> 02:18:41,640
But it's not.

3138
02:18:41,820 --> 02:18:43,360
If it's not, so I'll give it to you.

3139
02:18:43,760 --> 02:18:45,220
There's a lot I could do in return.

3140
02:18:46,020 --> 02:18:47,560
Oh my god, it's just okay.

3141
02:18:48,060 --> 02:18:48,560
It's fine.

3142
02:18:49,080 --> 02:18:49,640
That's fine.

3143
02:18:50,740 --> 02:18:51,220
Alright.

3144
02:18:52,180 --> 02:18:53,540
I'll go the other way back.

3145
02:18:53,740 --> 02:18:54,240
I don't...

3146
02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:55,880
I'm scared I have to fight the big guys.

3147
02:19:00,340 --> 02:19:02,420
Alright, at least it's not soggy medicine.

3148
02:19:02,460 --> 02:19:03,400
Thank fucking god.

3149
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:07,720
Hey, we're just gonna run past all of them.

3150
02:19:08,480 --> 02:19:09,800
I cannot be bothered.

3151
02:19:10,640 --> 02:19:11,220
They're like...

3152
02:19:11,220 --> 02:19:15,380
They gave me too little XP to actually make it worth fighting.

3153
02:19:16,560 --> 02:19:19,980
If they were like the strong guys, then I'm fine with it.

3154
02:19:20,140 --> 02:19:20,400
Okay.

3155
02:19:20,400 --> 02:19:21,460
Are you...

3156
02:19:21,460 --> 02:19:22,260
Oh my god.

3157
02:19:22,420 --> 02:19:23,180
I was...

3158
02:19:24,620 --> 02:19:25,380
Oh my god.

3159
02:19:25,380 --> 02:19:26,300
I don't have enough magic too.

3160
02:19:26,540 --> 02:19:26,800
Fuck.

3161
02:19:26,960 --> 02:19:27,100
Okay.

3162
02:19:27,660 --> 02:19:28,140
It's fine.

3163
02:19:28,620 --> 02:19:30,080
I can run past all of them.

3164
02:19:30,940 --> 02:19:31,880
I'm so sad.

3165
02:19:32,160 --> 02:19:34,780
I accidentally used up two of my magic attacks there.

3166
02:19:36,300 --> 02:19:37,360
Cause I got...

3167
02:19:37,360 --> 02:19:38,140
I was trying...

3168
02:19:38,140 --> 02:19:39,680
I forgot I always had my sword with me.

3169
02:19:40,240 --> 02:19:41,440
I thought I had...

3170
02:19:42,480 --> 02:19:43,220
The win.

3171
02:19:45,480 --> 02:19:46,600
Okay, they're like...

3172
02:19:46,600 --> 02:19:48,660
It's like fighting a level five Zubat.

3173
02:19:48,820 --> 02:19:49,140
I...

3174
02:19:49,140 --> 02:19:50,140
It's not worth it.

3175
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:51,640
It's not worth my time.

3176
02:19:52,160 --> 02:19:55,440
To fight a level five Zubat for like five XP, guys.

3177
02:20:02,400 --> 02:20:02,840
Alright.

3178
02:20:04,420 --> 02:20:05,900
You think he's made of stone?

3179
02:20:10,010 --> 02:20:10,890
Oh, nevermind.

3180
02:20:12,050 --> 02:20:13,150
Yeah, I'll use my sword here.

3181
02:20:18,680 --> 02:20:21,180
I mean, he is made of stone, but you know what I mean.

3182
02:20:23,520 --> 02:20:24,460
What do I do here?

3183
02:20:24,580 --> 02:20:25,040
What shit!

3184
02:20:26,100 --> 02:20:29,270
Oh my god.

3185
02:20:29,390 --> 02:20:30,170
I fucking hate you.

3186
02:20:30,350 --> 02:20:31,150
I hate you.

3187
02:20:31,290 --> 02:20:32,190
I hate you!

3188
02:20:35,750 --> 02:20:36,250
Okay.

3189
02:20:36,550 --> 02:20:37,630
That's time to suck here.

3190
02:20:38,430 --> 02:20:38,930
Nice.

3191
02:20:39,810 --> 02:20:41,050
Got the suck just in time.

3192
02:20:44,130 --> 02:20:44,810
Okay.

3193
02:20:45,330 --> 02:20:45,410
Okay.

3194
02:20:46,930 --> 02:20:47,610
Uh...

3195
02:20:47,610 --> 02:20:49,510
Am I supposed to...

3196
02:20:49,510 --> 02:20:49,850
Here?

3197
02:20:49,970 --> 02:20:50,230
Oh!

3198
02:20:50,910 --> 02:20:52,030
What the fuck?

3199
02:20:52,690 --> 02:20:54,230
He like just jumped out of nowhere!

3200
02:20:58,280 --> 02:20:58,780
Oh.

3201
02:20:59,280 --> 02:20:59,660
Goodbye.

3202
02:21:04,460 --> 02:21:05,480
Let me share.

3203
02:21:06,400 --> 02:21:06,860
Wait.

3204
02:21:06,980 --> 02:21:08,080
There's like...

3205
02:21:08,080 --> 02:21:08,820
Something...

3206
02:21:08,820 --> 02:21:09,020
Oh.

3207
02:21:09,780 --> 02:21:10,300
Alright.

3208
02:21:10,560 --> 02:21:12,040
These guys are worth farming though.

3209
02:21:12,220 --> 02:21:13,640
They actually give me lots of XP.

3210
02:21:14,500 --> 02:21:15,260
So I'll...

3211
02:21:15,260 --> 02:21:16,020
I'll farm them.

3212
02:21:16,240 --> 02:21:17,760
They're not like the lizard people.

3213
02:21:19,040 --> 02:21:21,140
Lizards just lay too many eggs.

3214
02:21:21,140 --> 02:21:22,000
So they're like...

3215
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:23,980
Their value lowers down.

3216
02:21:24,180 --> 02:21:24,800
There's just too many.

3217
02:21:25,240 --> 02:21:25,680
You know?

3218
02:21:25,760 --> 02:21:26,560
Supply and demand.

3219
02:21:32,400 --> 02:21:33,200
That's fine.

3220
02:21:33,480 --> 02:21:35,400
I want them to respawn.

3221
02:21:39,790 --> 02:21:40,350
Okay.

3222
02:21:41,270 --> 02:21:41,670
No!

3223
02:21:42,090 --> 02:21:43,810
Why did you get it away?!

3224
02:21:44,650 --> 02:21:45,650
Oh my god.

3225
02:21:45,730 --> 02:21:46,390
I'm so sad.

3226
02:21:46,850 --> 02:21:47,930
That was meant for him.

3227
02:21:51,480 --> 02:21:53,400
You fucker actually got in the way.

3228
02:21:53,580 --> 02:21:55,880
I had to waste the magic on you!

3229
02:21:58,900 --> 02:21:59,340
Oh my god.

3230
02:21:59,420 --> 02:22:00,000
And then he got up.

3231
02:22:04,180 --> 02:22:05,000
Oh nice.

3232
02:22:05,380 --> 02:22:05,780
Souls.

3233
02:22:08,340 --> 02:22:08,860
Suck.

3234
02:22:13,510 --> 02:22:14,030
Alright.

3235
02:22:14,670 --> 02:22:16,270
We gotta go...

3236
02:22:16,270 --> 02:22:16,950
This way.

3237
02:22:24,360 --> 02:22:24,740
Oh.

3238
02:22:25,740 --> 02:22:26,900
Crits yield more souls?

3239
02:22:27,120 --> 02:22:27,900
That's so cool.

3240
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:29,100
I wonder how you can crit.

3241
02:22:31,740 --> 02:22:32,760
Oh my god.

3242
02:22:33,020 --> 02:22:33,380
Man.

3243
02:22:33,580 --> 02:22:35,240
The only issue is that...

3244
02:22:35,240 --> 02:22:36,980
I don't know how to crit, guys.

3245
02:22:37,840 --> 02:22:38,800
If only...

3246
02:22:38,800 --> 02:22:40,260
If only...

3247
02:22:40,260 --> 02:22:41,060
If only...

3248
02:22:41,060 --> 02:22:43,820
If only I could crit so I could do just like...

3249
02:22:43,820 --> 02:22:44,360
Just that.

3250
02:22:45,960 --> 02:22:46,440
Because...

3251
02:22:46,980 --> 02:22:50,880
That's the one thing that may or may not be stopping me with that.

3252
02:23:00,060 --> 02:23:00,540
How...

3253
02:23:00,540 --> 02:23:02,440
How do I open those boxes?

3254
02:23:06,700 --> 02:23:07,760
Am I like...

3255
02:23:07,760 --> 02:23:08,220
Do I...

3256
02:23:08,220 --> 02:23:09,660
I still don't have the item, right?

3257
02:23:09,840 --> 02:23:10,820
To get those boxes?

3258
02:23:10,820 --> 02:23:11,840
I just wanna be sure.

3259
02:23:18,250 --> 02:23:19,510
I wanna be sure.

3260
02:23:20,510 --> 02:23:22,110
Oh, it's a different character.

3261
02:23:22,350 --> 02:23:22,950
Oh my god.

3262
02:23:23,050 --> 02:23:23,430
Than it is.

3263
02:23:23,690 --> 02:23:23,910
Backtrack.

3264
02:23:31,500 --> 02:23:32,660
March 1573.

3265
02:23:33,020 --> 02:23:33,660
Human calendar.

3266
02:23:38,440 --> 02:23:41,520
Those who enter will receive 500 human bodies.

3267
02:23:42,300 --> 02:23:43,660
As a special bonus.

3268
02:23:43,800 --> 02:23:44,600
Oh my god.

3269
02:23:45,560 --> 02:23:47,760
Oh, I gotta quit my day job.

3270
02:23:47,760 --> 02:23:49,300
How do I apply?

3271
02:23:50,160 --> 02:23:52,040
500 human bodies?

3272
02:23:52,500 --> 02:23:53,930
That's so many humans.

3273
02:24:02,290 --> 02:24:06,610
The schedule is subject to change based upon the performance of the Takeda Hunt.

3274
02:24:06,890 --> 02:24:08,150
What a bonus!

3275
02:24:08,470 --> 02:24:09,170
What the fuck?

3276
02:24:10,990 --> 02:24:12,330
How do I apply?

3277
02:24:12,330 --> 02:24:12,750
I...

3278
02:24:16,660 --> 02:24:17,660
Oh my god.

3279
02:24:17,800 --> 02:24:18,420
This is a fucker.

3280
02:24:21,120 --> 02:24:22,240
Get out of here.

3281
02:24:22,800 --> 02:24:23,860
Get out of here!

3282
02:24:25,220 --> 02:24:26,140
Of course!

3283
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,220
Of course I auto-lock into you.

3284
02:24:32,380 --> 02:24:34,580
You worthless fucking lizard man.

3285
02:24:37,300 --> 02:24:39,720
The only reason there's so many...

3286
02:24:39,720 --> 02:24:40,980
You're like a fucking Zergling.

3287
02:24:41,180 --> 02:24:41,840
Oh my god.

3288
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:42,400
That's it.

3289
02:24:42,560 --> 02:24:44,060
I'm bringing in that tornado.

3290
02:24:44,720 --> 02:24:45,520
That's it.

3291
02:24:48,920 --> 02:24:49,440
Indi...

3292
02:24:50,060 --> 02:24:51,980
Individual wise, you're not special.

3293
02:24:54,540 --> 02:24:57,540
Your only worth is that there's so many of you.

3294
02:25:02,840 --> 02:25:03,360
Alright.

3295
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:06,480
I wonder if I can kill him.

3296
02:25:06,700 --> 02:25:06,760
Alright.

3297
02:25:07,080 --> 02:25:07,640
No, I can't.

3298
02:25:08,180 --> 02:25:09,760
Alright, I gotta use one more magic.

3299
02:25:14,040 --> 02:25:15,640
Yeah, too many clearly.

3300
02:25:16,380 --> 02:25:17,560
Got practice.

3301
02:25:21,560 --> 02:25:22,880
Clearly we...

3302
02:25:22,880 --> 02:25:25,200
We need sex ed for these lizard people.

3303
02:25:30,390 --> 02:25:33,260
Although Lord Nobunaga was killed in Okehazama.

3304
02:25:34,090 --> 02:25:36,830
He rose from the dead by the power of the demons.

3305
02:25:36,830 --> 02:25:43,650
With the help of Fortinabras, Nobunaga tried to exterminate the Saito clan of Minno province.

3306
02:25:43,850 --> 02:25:44,970
But the only warrior...

3307
02:25:45,470 --> 02:25:46,870
Oh, are they like the...

3308
02:25:46,870 --> 02:25:48,370
Are they like the lesbian lizards?

3309
02:25:48,530 --> 02:25:48,930
Where they...

3310
02:25:48,930 --> 02:25:49,570
They're all female.

3311
02:25:49,570 --> 02:25:50,510
They just like...

3312
02:25:50,510 --> 02:25:51,910
Reproduce and clone themselves.

3313
02:25:53,530 --> 02:25:55,210
Stop this evil plan.

3314
02:25:55,570 --> 02:26:02,090
When the king of the demons, Fortinabras, met his ultimate fate at Inabayama castle.

3315
02:26:02,650 --> 02:26:05,150
Nobunaga's evil ambition also came to an end.

3316
02:26:05,590 --> 02:26:08,190
No one could imagine that Fortinabras would be defeated.

3317
02:26:08,190 --> 02:26:11,150
It was the worst crisis the demons ever faced.

3318
02:26:11,350 --> 02:26:13,270
But it's Nobunaga who saved them.

3319
02:26:13,630 --> 02:26:17,230
Although he was originally a human, Fortinabras saw his potential.

3320
02:26:17,470 --> 02:26:18,150
And soon...

3321
02:26:18,150 --> 02:26:22,170
Nobunaga created order from the chaos and became the king of the demons.

3322
02:26:22,470 --> 02:26:25,130
He destroyed the Saito clan of Minno province.

3323
02:26:25,330 --> 02:26:28,110
And is now ready to conquer the entire world.

3324
02:26:29,210 --> 02:26:31,530
Okay, but what about like American demons?

3325
02:26:31,830 --> 02:26:33,350
Would American demons let him do that?

3326
02:26:34,230 --> 02:26:34,810
Like...

3327
02:26:34,810 --> 02:26:35,530
Cause he's like...

3328
02:26:35,530 --> 02:26:35,890
It's like...

3329
02:26:35,890 --> 02:26:36,430
You know how like...

3330
02:26:36,430 --> 02:26:39,470
It's like zombie apocalypse that only happens in like...

3331
02:26:39,470 --> 02:26:40,710
America or London?

3332
02:26:42,090 --> 02:26:44,310
And everybody just looks around and be like...

3333
02:26:44,310 --> 02:26:45,350
Are they okay, guys?

3334
02:26:47,590 --> 02:26:48,750
So today...

3335
02:26:48,750 --> 02:26:51,710
The golden evil statue is complete.

3336
02:26:52,110 --> 02:26:55,550
The statue is made out of roughly 6,000 tons of gold.

3337
02:26:55,550 --> 02:27:02,510
When I first saw Guildenstern's design specification, I could not fathom why Lord Nobunaga wanted the statue.

3338
02:27:02,790 --> 02:27:03,950
But now it's complete.

3339
02:27:04,750 --> 02:27:09,810
I can understand and am confident that the statue shines with a dignity that entites humans to worship it.

3340
02:27:10,310 --> 02:27:15,030
Humans love nothing more than to idolize them, those they consider above themselves.

3341
02:27:15,390 --> 02:27:25,790
While Fortinabras tried to rule humans for force, Nobunaga, being human himself, understand how the little maggots think and what their weaknesses are.

3342
02:27:26,130 --> 02:27:30,150
Under his rule, we have enjoyed many ceremonies and sacrifices.

3343
02:27:30,610 --> 02:27:34,010
The statue will allow us to feast upon even more delicious flesh.

3344
02:27:34,510 --> 02:27:36,350
Lord Nobunaga is a genius!

3345
02:27:36,770 --> 02:27:38,070
Is that really all it takes?

3346
02:27:38,190 --> 02:27:39,730
Like one fucking shiny statue?

3347
02:27:40,470 --> 02:27:41,110
Sorry.

3348
02:27:41,370 --> 02:27:44,410
One fucking shiny golden evil statue.

3349
02:27:47,950 --> 02:27:49,570
Like that's all it takes.

3350
02:27:52,510 --> 02:27:54,390
Humans are such simple creatures.

3351
02:27:54,730 --> 02:27:56,310
As long as it's gold and evil.

3352
02:27:58,110 --> 02:27:59,630
Thank you very much, sir.

3353
02:27:59,990 --> 02:28:01,830
I never expect to be saved.

3354
02:28:02,830 --> 02:28:03,630
Can I freeze up?

3355
02:28:05,390 --> 02:28:06,350
Oh, no?

3356
02:28:06,630 --> 02:28:06,950
Okay.

3357
02:28:07,930 --> 02:28:09,050
Okay, I guess.

3358
02:28:09,730 --> 02:28:10,310
Okay.

3359
02:28:11,270 --> 02:28:13,070
Okay, now this is a little harder.

3360
02:28:17,660 --> 02:28:18,500
I think?

3361
02:28:22,110 --> 02:28:22,790
No.

3362
02:28:23,270 --> 02:28:23,330
No.

3363
02:28:23,330 --> 02:28:23,870
Okay, never mind.

3364
02:28:24,030 --> 02:28:25,250
It's just literally checkers.

3365
02:28:26,390 --> 02:28:27,070
Like...

3366
02:28:27,070 --> 02:28:28,010
Never mind.

3367
02:28:28,350 --> 02:28:28,950
It's just...

3368
02:28:28,950 --> 02:28:29,950
It's just checkers.

3369
02:28:31,870 --> 02:28:32,550
Alright.

3370
02:28:32,890 --> 02:28:33,270
Nice.

3371
02:28:37,420 --> 02:28:38,100
Okay.

3372
02:28:43,450 --> 02:28:44,890
A blood pond.

3373
02:28:45,330 --> 02:28:47,030
Where did they get all this blood from?

3374
02:28:49,730 --> 02:28:50,290
Oh.

3375
02:28:50,810 --> 02:28:51,090
Oh.

3376
02:28:51,090 --> 02:28:52,170
Special magic liquid.

3377
02:28:52,930 --> 02:28:53,050
Oh.

3378
02:28:54,010 --> 02:28:54,870
I don't know.

3379
02:28:54,970 --> 02:28:57,070
Feels awfully bossy of it.

3380
02:28:58,410 --> 02:28:58,970
Oh.

3381
02:28:59,170 --> 02:29:01,850
This feels like an actual boss fight now.

3382
02:29:03,410 --> 02:29:06,750
Maybe I shouldn't have used my magic there.

3383
02:29:07,390 --> 02:29:08,170
Oh well.

3384
02:29:13,390 --> 02:29:14,090
Oh my god.

3385
02:29:14,150 --> 02:29:14,850
Are you serious?

3386
02:29:15,290 --> 02:29:17,530
I was in the middle of my fucking magic attack.

3387
02:29:23,120 --> 02:29:23,680
Okay.

3388
02:29:23,780 --> 02:29:24,520
That's fucked up.

3389
02:29:25,600 --> 02:29:27,380
He interrupted my magic.

3390
02:29:27,780 --> 02:29:28,540
Now I'm mad.

3391
02:29:30,260 --> 02:29:31,320
Interrupted my flow.

3392
02:29:31,840 --> 02:29:32,760
My groove.

3393
02:29:34,580 --> 02:29:35,140
Okay.

3394
02:29:35,260 --> 02:29:36,580
I need to find something here.

3395
02:29:41,960 --> 02:29:43,080
Never interrupt...

3396
02:29:44,740 --> 02:29:45,300
Jubei.

3397
02:29:45,360 --> 02:29:46,240
I had to remember his name.

3398
02:29:46,340 --> 02:29:48,700
Nobody said his name anymore for the longest time.

3399
02:29:49,060 --> 02:29:49,580
I was like...

3400
02:29:49,580 --> 02:29:51,260
What was his name again?

3401
02:29:51,540 --> 02:29:53,720
Literally no one said his name for so long.

3402
02:29:56,360 --> 02:29:57,660
I got confused.

3403
02:29:58,180 --> 02:29:59,340
I was like...

3404
02:29:59,340 --> 02:30:00,660
What was your name again, bro?

3405
02:30:01,380 --> 02:30:02,000
Oh my god.

3406
02:30:02,140 --> 02:30:02,780
There's three of them.

3407
02:30:03,160 --> 02:30:04,240
Oh my god.

3408
02:30:04,400 --> 02:30:06,020
And I don't have enough magic power.

3409
02:30:10,710 --> 02:30:11,230
Okay.

3410
02:30:11,290 --> 02:30:11,610
That's fine.

3411
02:30:11,810 --> 02:30:12,510
I still have hammer.

3412
02:30:13,170 --> 02:30:13,570
Hammer!

3413
02:30:15,710 --> 02:30:16,230
Hammer!

3414
02:30:20,210 --> 02:30:20,730
Hammer!

3415
02:30:21,610 --> 02:30:22,410
Jesus Christ.

3416
02:30:22,630 --> 02:30:22,710
Okay.

3417
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:29,600
Okay.

3418
02:30:29,700 --> 02:30:30,200
I can't see.

3419
02:30:33,360 --> 02:30:34,180
Hammer still!

3420
02:30:34,440 --> 02:30:34,820
Oh my god.

3421
02:30:34,900 --> 02:30:35,440
I still had hammer.

3422
02:30:35,840 --> 02:30:36,400
Oh, thank god.

3423
02:30:42,080 --> 02:30:42,560
Okay.

3424
02:30:42,780 --> 02:30:43,600
Oh shit!

3425
02:30:47,560 --> 02:30:48,040
Okay.

3426
02:30:48,240 --> 02:30:48,720
That's fine.

3427
02:30:52,570 --> 02:30:53,110
There we go.

3428
02:30:53,110 --> 02:30:53,170
There we go.

3429
02:30:55,810 --> 02:30:57,510
Oh, and I got mushroom.

3430
02:30:59,670 --> 02:31:01,010
Jesus Christ.

3431
02:31:01,950 --> 02:31:02,970
Why are you...

3432
02:31:02,970 --> 02:31:03,870
Oh my god.

3433
02:31:03,870 --> 02:31:04,370
I was gonna say.

3434
02:31:04,870 --> 02:31:06,070
My depth perception.

3435
02:31:10,110 --> 02:31:11,910
I was like, where are you?

3436
02:31:12,850 --> 02:31:13,210
Smash!

3437
02:31:13,210 --> 02:31:13,550
Smash!

3438
02:31:17,680 --> 02:31:18,860
Okay, this way.

3439
02:31:20,120 --> 02:31:20,940
This way?

3440
02:31:21,160 --> 02:31:21,940
Yeah, this way.

3441
02:31:27,500 --> 02:31:30,100
Okay, maybe there's something over here.

3442
02:31:30,900 --> 02:31:31,340
Whoa.

3443
02:31:31,820 --> 02:31:33,680
Whoa, he seems a little scary, guys.

3444
02:31:34,200 --> 02:31:34,360
Whoa.

3445
02:31:35,120 --> 02:31:35,800
Whoa.

3446
02:31:37,320 --> 02:31:38,000
Hammer?

3447
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:38,740
Hahaha!

3448
02:31:41,880 --> 02:31:42,780
Okay, that's fine.

3449
02:31:43,340 --> 02:31:44,340
I have magic!

3450
02:31:46,300 --> 02:31:46,780
Nice.

3451
02:31:47,840 --> 02:31:49,260
I was a little worried there.

3452
02:31:51,100 --> 02:31:52,740
I was like, hammer time?

3453
02:31:54,420 --> 02:31:55,180
Wait, what?

3454
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:56,760
Oh, okay.

3455
02:31:57,160 --> 02:31:58,940
I was like, what am I jumping for?

3456
02:32:00,700 --> 02:32:01,180
Jesus.

3457
02:32:01,440 --> 02:32:01,640
Okay.

3458
02:32:02,840 --> 02:32:04,200
Okay, I got this, guys.

3459
02:32:14,160 --> 02:32:15,020
Oh my god.

3460
02:32:15,140 --> 02:32:15,500
I fucked up.

3461
02:32:16,380 --> 02:32:16,540
Wait, wait.

3462
02:32:16,540 --> 02:32:17,460
I actually got this.

3463
02:32:32,930 --> 02:32:33,930
Okay, wait, wait.

3464
02:32:34,190 --> 02:32:35,590
Wait, I actually got this.

3465
02:32:36,170 --> 02:32:36,690
Wait.

3466
02:32:38,030 --> 02:32:38,550
Wait.

3467
02:32:54,430 --> 02:32:55,290
Ah, see?

3468
02:32:55,470 --> 02:32:55,670
See?

3469
02:32:55,730 --> 02:32:56,190
I told you.

3470
02:32:56,270 --> 02:32:56,830
I told you.

3471
02:32:57,030 --> 02:32:57,910
I told...

3472
02:32:57,910 --> 02:32:58,710
I knew it.

3473
02:32:58,930 --> 02:32:59,770
I told you.

3474
02:33:00,050 --> 02:33:01,450
Guys, I told you.

3475
02:33:01,570 --> 02:33:03,290
I told you I got this.

3476
02:33:03,830 --> 02:33:05,790
Oh, we're my non-believers.

3477
02:33:06,230 --> 02:33:07,010
That's right.

3478
02:33:07,230 --> 02:33:09,550
Show yourself my non-believers.

3479
02:33:10,270 --> 02:33:10,790
That's...

3480
02:33:13,690 --> 02:33:15,290
I saw you guys.

3481
02:33:15,530 --> 02:33:16,810
You guys didn't believe.

3482
02:33:21,490 --> 02:33:22,750
I knew it.

3483
02:33:22,890 --> 02:33:23,410
Aw, man.

3484
02:33:24,690 --> 02:33:27,490
All those non-believers out there.

3485
02:33:29,010 --> 02:33:30,290
The doubters.

3486
02:33:30,490 --> 02:33:31,570
All my doubters.

3487
02:33:31,730 --> 02:33:32,550
Look at me now.

3488
02:33:33,950 --> 02:33:34,850
That's right.

3489
02:33:35,730 --> 02:33:36,330
That's right.

3490
02:33:36,330 --> 02:33:37,930
This is who you doubted in high school.

3491
02:33:46,940 --> 02:33:48,380
Should be almost dead, yeah.

3492
02:33:49,040 --> 02:33:51,720
I know it's like the magic makes them like almost dead.

3493
02:33:53,120 --> 02:33:53,780
That's right.

3494
02:33:53,780 --> 02:33:54,940
That fucking low up.

3495
02:33:57,260 --> 02:33:59,320
That's the kid you doubted in high school.

3496
02:34:00,360 --> 02:34:01,480
Look at her now.

3497
02:34:02,360 --> 02:34:03,900
She solved that puzzle.

3498
02:34:04,620 --> 02:34:06,100
And she didn't cry.

3499
02:34:10,540 --> 02:34:12,540
She didn't cry this time.

3500
02:34:21,410 --> 02:34:21,950
Oh, nice.

3501
02:34:22,110 --> 02:34:22,950
The scarlet key.

3502
02:34:23,210 --> 02:34:24,030
Which key was that?

3503
02:34:25,430 --> 02:34:26,690
Wait, can I take these?

3504
02:34:28,170 --> 02:34:30,210
I should be allowed to take it.

3505
02:34:32,690 --> 02:34:33,850
Oh, I'm here?

3506
02:34:33,850 --> 02:34:33,930
Where?

3507
02:34:34,250 --> 02:34:36,250
Where the fuck do I go now?

3508
02:34:39,150 --> 02:34:40,470
It's back here?

3509
02:34:42,430 --> 02:34:44,570
I'll kill you for XP, actually.

3510
02:34:45,170 --> 02:34:46,810
Might be good XP farm.

3511
02:34:48,230 --> 02:34:49,430
Oh yeah, definitely.

3512
02:34:50,470 --> 02:34:52,030
Yeah, I need this for XP.

3513
02:34:59,830 --> 02:35:01,390
Okay, I'll save for that.

3514
02:35:05,880 --> 02:35:07,060
Okay, and then...

3515
02:35:07,960 --> 02:35:08,560
Enhance.

3516
02:35:09,780 --> 02:35:10,980
That's right, enhance.

3517
02:35:12,920 --> 02:35:14,300
Okay, down here.

3518
02:35:16,980 --> 02:35:20,220
That has to be for the statue now, right?

3519
02:35:21,720 --> 02:35:22,240
Oh!

3520
02:35:22,480 --> 02:35:23,300
Oh my god.

3521
02:35:23,540 --> 02:35:24,620
Okay, that actually got me.

3522
02:35:25,260 --> 02:35:26,560
He actually got me.

3523
02:35:27,500 --> 02:35:28,860
I was not expecting it.

3524
02:35:32,770 --> 02:35:34,050
That's right, got range!

3525
02:35:34,730 --> 02:35:35,470
That's right!

3526
02:35:37,790 --> 02:35:38,310
Suck!

3527
02:35:41,330 --> 02:35:41,850
Bullshit!

3528
02:35:41,950 --> 02:35:42,330
Oh my god!

3529
02:35:42,330 --> 02:35:43,690
That's right, you missed!

3530
02:35:45,690 --> 02:35:47,230
What are the mushrooms for?

3531
02:35:47,370 --> 02:35:48,690
I've got so many of them.

3532
02:35:51,230 --> 02:35:52,910
Wait, they're not even in my inventory.

3533
02:35:54,830 --> 02:35:55,270
What?

3534
02:35:56,190 --> 02:35:57,870
I swear to god, are they gifts?

3535
02:36:00,530 --> 02:36:01,550
Of course they are.

3536
02:36:01,550 --> 02:36:04,170
I can't even give it to them!

3537
02:36:09,270 --> 02:36:11,150
I have no friends!

3538
02:36:12,310 --> 02:36:12,830
I

3539
02:36:17,360 --> 02:36:18,420
got greedy!

3540
02:36:19,880 --> 02:36:20,400
All

3541
02:36:24,750 --> 02:36:26,430
my friends were like, bros.

3542
02:36:26,970 --> 02:36:29,770
Ever since you got with her, we like never hang out now.

3543
02:36:30,010 --> 02:36:31,030
So like, I don't know.

3544
02:36:32,990 --> 02:36:33,870
No!

3545
02:36:34,310 --> 02:36:34,430
No!

3546
02:36:34,650 --> 02:36:37,030
Never choose the host before the bros!

3547
02:36:40,910 --> 02:36:42,090
Not here?

3548
02:36:44,710 --> 02:36:47,350
What was the door with the two eyes?

3549
02:36:47,350 --> 02:36:47,550
Guys!

3550
02:36:50,090 --> 02:36:51,210
Oh, the robot!

3551
02:36:51,410 --> 02:36:52,650
Oh my god, I don't remember.

3552
02:36:53,190 --> 02:36:55,030
It's been 20 years, guys.

3553
02:36:55,410 --> 02:36:57,330
I cannot remember.

3554
02:36:59,130 --> 02:37:00,230
It's not us, bro.

3555
02:37:00,350 --> 02:37:00,770
It's you.

3556
02:37:00,930 --> 02:37:02,930
That's the reason why we don't hang out anymore.

3557
02:37:14,100 --> 02:37:14,700
See?

3558
02:37:14,940 --> 02:37:16,200
They're so nice.

3559
02:37:19,630 --> 02:37:20,550
Oh my god!

3560
02:37:20,670 --> 02:37:21,830
What the fuck?!

3561
02:37:23,370 --> 02:37:24,830
Where are the robots?!

3562
02:37:32,970 --> 02:37:33,570
What?!

3563
02:37:42,600 --> 02:37:44,140
Oh my god!

3564
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:45,400
Oh

3565
02:37:50,130 --> 02:37:50,510
my god!

3566
02:37:50,630 --> 02:37:51,330
I'm so lost!

3567
02:37:51,550 --> 02:37:52,910
I'm actually so lost!

3568
02:37:57,780 --> 02:37:59,260
I'm so sad.

3569
02:37:59,980 --> 02:38:02,960
Oh my god, I'm gonna die to the bozeman!

3570
02:38:05,860 --> 02:38:08,240
Oh my god, I'm actually gonna die to the bozeman!

3571
02:38:08,560 --> 02:38:09,040
I...

3572
02:38:09,040 --> 02:38:11,940
...I can't get there.

3573
02:38:12,040 --> 02:38:12,960
I can't get there!

3574
02:38:13,720 --> 02:38:16,520
Oh my god, I'm just dying to the bozeman!

3575
02:38:28,040 --> 02:38:31,360
Oh my god, okay, I have to use that though.

3576
02:38:31,520 --> 02:38:33,300
If I didn't, I actually would have died.

3577
02:38:35,980 --> 02:38:36,960
Holy fuck.

3578
02:38:45,700 --> 02:38:47,120
I'm so mad.

3579
02:38:48,620 --> 02:38:50,200
They're like, there's a robot.

3580
02:38:50,380 --> 02:38:52,540
There's a robot you were asking about earlier.

3581
02:38:52,880 --> 02:38:54,760
And I'm like, not like that.

3582
02:38:55,520 --> 02:38:58,360
That's not what I mean and you know it.

3583
02:39:07,700 --> 02:39:10,220
I don't think I would have had enough time to use my gun.

3584
02:39:11,980 --> 02:39:13,160
I don't think so.

3585
02:39:13,540 --> 02:39:14,660
That's why I didn't use it.

3586
02:39:16,360 --> 02:39:17,900
Oh, it's the evil human.

3587
02:39:19,060 --> 02:39:20,700
Oh, there you are.

3588
02:39:24,700 --> 02:39:25,900
Couldn't do that?

3589
02:39:26,520 --> 02:39:28,700
Bro, you were so strong.

3590
02:39:29,120 --> 02:39:30,700
You couldn't just push him?

3591
02:39:36,340 --> 02:39:37,160
Oh, no.

3592
02:39:37,320 --> 02:39:37,480
Whoa!

3593
02:39:38,800 --> 02:39:40,880
Okay, she better help me now.

3594
02:39:41,780 --> 02:39:43,780
Yeah, I'm like, why is she so helpless?

3595
02:39:43,780 --> 02:39:46,580
Not like she was fighting fucking demons earlier.

3596
02:39:49,840 --> 02:39:51,660
Like, how are you helpless now?

3597
02:39:52,720 --> 02:39:54,880
That guy had like, no muscle.

3598
02:40:06,200 --> 02:40:07,320
What am I...

3599
02:40:07,320 --> 02:40:08,160
What do I do?

3600
02:40:09,720 --> 02:40:11,980
What the fuck do I do down here?

3601
02:40:19,210 --> 02:40:20,170
What is it?

3602
02:40:20,170 --> 02:40:20,930
Yeah.

3603
02:40:25,410 --> 02:40:25,970
Bro,

3604
02:40:30,390 --> 02:40:30,930
I love this game.

3605
02:40:31,050 --> 02:40:31,730
It's so campy.

3606
02:40:31,890 --> 02:40:33,110
It's so fucking weird.

3607
02:40:35,430 --> 02:40:37,650
It's like, so different from one.

3608
02:40:37,890 --> 02:40:39,810
One that was like, so serious.

3609
02:40:39,810 --> 02:40:42,530
But here they're like, let's just add...

3610
02:40:42,530 --> 02:40:43,090
I don't know.

3611
02:40:43,270 --> 02:40:45,570
Let's just add fucking robots or some shit.

3612
02:40:45,770 --> 02:40:47,390
I was like...

3613
02:40:47,390 --> 02:40:47,670
Yeah.

3614
02:40:48,170 --> 02:40:49,690
Like, what was like about demons?

3615
02:40:50,330 --> 02:40:50,810
And...

3616
02:40:50,810 --> 02:40:52,310
Like, demon lore?

3617
02:40:52,410 --> 02:40:53,810
And they're like, I don't fucking know.

3618
02:40:54,190 --> 02:40:54,650
Robots.

3619
02:40:54,910 --> 02:40:55,210
I don't know.

3620
02:40:55,210 --> 02:40:55,290
I don't know.

3621
02:40:57,710 --> 02:40:58,750
Who's Hoichi?

3622
02:41:03,210 --> 02:41:03,990
Oh!

3623
02:41:16,750 --> 02:41:17,250
Yeah!

3624
02:41:20,130 --> 02:41:20,810
That's her?

3625
02:41:30,670 --> 02:41:33,170
This guy has like, a fucking Wikipedia about her.

3626
02:41:33,310 --> 02:41:34,030
Like, holy shit!

3627
02:41:38,710 --> 02:41:39,230
Once...

3628
02:41:39,230 --> 02:41:39,330
Once...

3629
02:41:39,330 --> 02:41:42,030
I became a member of the Asai family.

3630
02:41:42,330 --> 02:41:44,230
I thought I should stop my brother.

3631
02:41:45,490 --> 02:41:48,990
So I went to Gifu castle and tried to take his life.

3632
02:41:54,790 --> 02:41:56,130
That's when I met you.

3633
02:41:56,850 --> 02:41:57,150
Yeah?

3634
02:41:58,050 --> 02:42:01,130
And she's like, why do I try to do all the work when he's there?

3635
02:42:11,680 --> 02:42:12,200
Me?

3636
02:42:14,440 --> 02:42:15,520
Points at myself?

3637
02:42:18,900 --> 02:42:20,390
That's right, Nobunaga.

3638
02:42:20,820 --> 02:42:22,480
I'm gonna bang your sister.

3639
02:42:22,860 --> 02:42:24,400
The greatest revenge.

3640
02:42:25,380 --> 02:42:27,520
You killed my entire family?

3641
02:42:28,260 --> 02:42:29,100
I...

3642
02:42:29,100 --> 02:42:30,200
Fuck your sister.

3643
02:42:36,600 --> 02:42:37,180
Yeah!

3644
02:42:39,280 --> 02:42:40,720
The wildest wildest.

3645
02:42:46,750 --> 02:42:49,290
And then I'm gonna marry her and take your children.

3646
02:42:49,390 --> 02:42:51,730
And then your daughters are gonna call me dad.

3647
02:43:03,530 --> 02:43:04,950
Sorry, your nieces.

3648
02:43:05,210 --> 02:43:07,510
Then your nieces will call me dad.

3649
02:43:08,850 --> 02:43:09,590
I forgot.

3650
02:43:09,850 --> 02:43:10,690
I was like, wait, no.

3651
02:43:10,950 --> 02:43:11,830
That's the brother.

3652
02:43:12,030 --> 02:43:12,990
They're not like me.

3653
02:43:15,970 --> 02:43:17,310
That's right, Nobunaga.

3654
02:43:17,430 --> 02:43:18,290
You see this?

3655
02:43:18,930 --> 02:43:20,410
That's... Oh, shit!

3656
02:43:20,970 --> 02:43:21,350
That's right!

3657
02:43:21,910 --> 02:43:23,630
Nobunaga's like, no, not my sister!

3658
02:43:24,370 --> 02:43:24,530
No!

3659
02:43:28,630 --> 02:43:31,010
Nobunaga's like, wait, wait, stop!

3660
02:43:31,210 --> 02:43:31,850
That's my sister!

3661
02:43:32,330 --> 02:43:32,570
Stop!

3662
02:43:33,310 --> 02:43:34,290
Not my sister!

3663
02:43:34,710 --> 02:43:37,170
You fucking... you fucking whore!

3664
02:43:37,510 --> 02:43:39,010
Ha ha ha ha!

3665
02:43:43,790 --> 02:43:45,210
How dare you!

3666
02:43:45,670 --> 02:43:46,570
Ha ha ha ha!

3667
02:43:48,330 --> 02:43:49,610
You hurt us.

3668
02:43:50,190 --> 02:43:51,630
You fucking hurt us.

3669
02:43:51,810 --> 02:43:53,070
Don't you, Nehra!

3670
02:43:53,470 --> 02:43:54,130
Ha ha ha ha!

3671
02:43:54,450 --> 02:43:55,930
Oh, no, you don't!

3672
02:43:56,390 --> 02:43:57,230
Ha ha ha ha!

3673
02:44:05,120 --> 02:44:07,720
NTR, don't you... It's not NTR!

3674
02:44:08,120 --> 02:44:09,280
It's the brother!

3675
02:44:09,280 --> 02:44:10,240
It's...

3676
02:44:11,520 --> 02:44:13,340
It's her brother, guys!

3677
02:44:13,440 --> 02:44:14,240
We're not playing that...

3678
02:44:14,240 --> 02:44:14,780
What the fuck?

3679
02:44:14,980 --> 02:44:15,240
That...

3680
02:44:15,240 --> 02:44:16,620
That incest game.

3681
02:44:16,860 --> 02:44:17,240
I forgot.

3682
02:44:17,900 --> 02:44:18,540
Some...

3683
02:44:18,540 --> 02:44:22,800
Something something family or whatever that game is.

3684
02:44:27,710 --> 02:44:31,030
Golgantus, he is the greatest swordsman of all the demons.

3685
02:44:31,550 --> 02:44:33,350
He moves gracefully like a dancer.

3686
02:44:33,710 --> 02:44:35,050
He's strong like a storm.

3687
02:44:35,430 --> 02:44:39,110
He has conjured a barrier like a steel wall around himself.

3688
02:44:39,310 --> 02:44:40,930
Which today has yet to be broken.

3689
02:44:41,050 --> 02:44:42,110
Yeah, Andy and Lele...

3690
02:44:42,110 --> 02:44:43,030
This is not an...

3691
02:44:43,030 --> 02:44:44,890
Copy of Andy and Lele, guys!

3692
02:44:44,890 --> 02:44:50,290
Only the sacred flute has a chance to defeat his incredible barrier.

3693
02:44:51,690 --> 02:44:52,210
Uh...

3694
02:44:52,210 --> 02:44:55,550
And only a swordsman who has the blood of the only can play his flute.

3695
02:44:56,810 --> 02:44:58,790
Oh shit, is that Mr. Nimbus?

3696
02:44:59,450 --> 02:45:02,430
Don't worry, I have the power of the flute, Mr. Nimbus!

3697
02:45:05,990 --> 02:45:06,790
Oh shit.

3698
02:45:07,150 --> 02:45:10,310
Oh my god, Nobunaga does not want me to kiss his sister.

3699
02:45:20,940 --> 02:45:22,860
Wait, I thought he was the enemy.

3700
02:45:23,540 --> 02:45:23,740
What?

3701
02:45:24,740 --> 02:45:25,400
What?

3702
02:45:25,560 --> 02:45:25,900
What the fuck?

3703
02:45:26,580 --> 02:45:27,060
Are you alright?

3704
02:45:28,300 --> 02:45:30,060
You don't have to be thankful.

3705
02:45:30,860 --> 02:45:34,060
It is quite natural for men to save.

3706
02:45:35,560 --> 02:45:36,320
Okay.

3707
02:45:37,180 --> 02:45:38,580
She's like...

3708
02:45:38,580 --> 02:45:39,000
Yeah.

3709
02:45:39,940 --> 02:45:40,960
That's me.

3710
02:45:41,140 --> 02:45:43,040
I'm so weak.

3711
02:45:43,500 --> 02:45:44,460
Oh my god.

3712
02:45:48,840 --> 02:45:50,120
Wait, what?

3713
02:45:50,460 --> 02:45:51,000
That's it?

3714
02:45:51,900 --> 02:45:55,580
This is the battle that I've been waiting for.

3715
02:45:58,150 --> 02:45:58,510
The...

3716
02:45:58,510 --> 02:46:01,010
My name is Gougandantus.

3717
02:46:01,130 --> 02:46:03,810
The greatest swordsman of all demons.

3718
02:46:04,930 --> 02:46:05,250
Whatever.

3719
02:46:06,110 --> 02:46:06,430
You say that...

3720
02:46:06,430 --> 02:46:06,710
Whatever.

3721
02:46:08,430 --> 02:46:09,590
Alright, skip.

3722
02:46:11,730 --> 02:46:13,370
Do you face like...

3723
02:46:13,710 --> 02:46:18,460
My name is Gougandantus, Benz.

3724
02:46:18,460 --> 02:46:19,620
Didn't you say that?

3725
02:46:19,780 --> 02:46:20,380
Can we get on with this?

3726
02:46:20,640 --> 02:46:21,960
Yeah, I was gonna say it.

3727
02:46:22,100 --> 02:46:23,480
I'm all yours.

3728
02:46:23,480 --> 02:46:24,720
Didn't we just say that?

3729
02:46:25,240 --> 02:46:25,840
Angar!

3730
02:46:28,060 --> 02:46:28,580
Okay.

3731
02:46:28,940 --> 02:46:29,740
Don't worry.

3732
02:46:29,960 --> 02:46:32,020
I shall play my magical flute.

3733
02:46:33,800 --> 02:46:34,640
That's right.

3734
02:46:34,840 --> 02:46:35,760
I got you now.

3735
02:46:36,500 --> 02:46:37,940
Don't do anything yet.

3736
02:46:38,080 --> 02:46:38,960
I'm playing my flute.

3737
02:46:43,100 --> 02:46:44,100
He's like...

3738
02:46:44,100 --> 02:46:44,300
No!

3739
02:46:44,800 --> 02:46:46,680
The power of music!

3740
02:46:47,480 --> 02:46:47,980
No!

3741
02:46:49,480 --> 02:46:50,680
Not music!

3742
02:46:55,700 --> 02:46:56,320
No!

3743
02:47:01,360 --> 02:47:01,980
Okay.

3744
02:47:02,680 --> 02:47:03,300
Nice.

3745
02:47:05,020 --> 02:47:06,180
I don't think...

3746
02:47:06,180 --> 02:47:07,140
No, I don't think he is.

3747
02:47:07,460 --> 02:47:07,980
What?

3748
02:47:09,240 --> 02:47:10,300
What the fuck?

3749
02:47:12,920 --> 02:47:13,880
Okay, wait.

3750
02:47:14,220 --> 02:47:14,860
Don't worry.

3751
02:47:14,980 --> 02:47:15,660
I have this.

3752
02:47:17,620 --> 02:47:18,860
That's fucking right.

3753
02:47:19,140 --> 02:47:20,040
I have...

3754
02:47:20,040 --> 02:47:20,240
Whoa!

3755
02:47:20,620 --> 02:47:20,860
Wait!

3756
02:47:20,860 --> 02:47:22,520
I still have this.

3757
02:47:24,060 --> 02:47:24,660
I still have this.

3758
02:47:24,660 --> 02:47:25,100
That's right.

3759
02:47:25,840 --> 02:47:26,600
Give me a sec.

3760
02:47:26,740 --> 02:47:27,140
Let me...

3761
02:47:27,140 --> 02:47:28,800
I still have this!

3762
02:47:30,340 --> 02:47:30,640
Okay.

3763
02:47:31,580 --> 02:47:32,600
And then...

3764
02:47:32,600 --> 02:47:33,340
Hammer time!

3765
02:47:34,560 --> 02:47:35,480
Oh, shit!

3766
02:47:36,880 --> 02:47:38,100
Do you think I hit him?

3767
02:47:39,540 --> 02:47:40,760
Do you think...

3768
02:47:40,760 --> 02:47:42,000
Oh, no.

3769
02:47:42,100 --> 02:47:42,520
That's okay.

3770
02:47:42,900 --> 02:47:44,320
I got this, too.

3771
02:47:46,480 --> 02:47:47,280
That's right!

3772
02:47:54,600 --> 02:47:55,080
Wait.

3773
02:47:56,540 --> 02:47:57,500
How far...

3774
02:47:57,500 --> 02:47:58,300
No, I'm not.

3775
02:47:58,460 --> 02:47:58,800
It's okay.

3776
02:47:58,980 --> 02:47:59,600
I can go back.

3777
02:48:00,160 --> 02:48:00,620
It's okay.

3778
02:48:00,780 --> 02:48:02,760
I didn't think he was gonna hit me there.

3779
02:48:02,880 --> 02:48:03,500
Okay, guys.

3780
02:48:06,420 --> 02:48:06,900
Alright.

3781
02:48:06,920 --> 02:48:08,380
What's my last autosave?

3782
02:48:11,140 --> 02:48:11,620
Wait.

3783
02:48:11,740 --> 02:48:12,300
Where am I?

3784
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:19,480
Oh!

3785
02:48:19,720 --> 02:48:20,540
Okay, it's not that far.

3786
02:48:20,780 --> 02:48:21,220
Okay.

3787
02:48:21,640 --> 02:48:21,940
Okay.

3788
02:48:22,220 --> 02:48:22,700
Hi!

3789
02:48:23,100 --> 02:48:23,580
Hi!

3790
02:48:23,800 --> 02:48:23,880
Hi!

3791
02:48:23,880 --> 02:48:24,140
Hi!

3792
02:48:24,160 --> 02:48:24,780
It's okay.

3793
02:48:26,540 --> 02:48:27,020
It's okay.

3794
02:48:27,020 --> 02:48:27,040
It's okay.

3795
02:48:27,240 --> 02:48:27,700
That's...

3796
02:48:28,760 --> 02:48:29,520
That's fine.

3797
02:48:31,080 --> 02:48:31,740
That's fine.

3798
02:48:31,840 --> 02:48:32,760
I got a little worried.

3799
02:48:33,420 --> 02:48:33,800
I...

3800
02:48:35,420 --> 02:48:36,820
I got a little worried.

3801
02:48:36,960 --> 02:48:38,320
It's just before the cutscene.

3802
02:48:38,500 --> 02:48:38,880
Thank God.

3803
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:39,800
I was like...

3804
02:48:39,800 --> 02:48:40,120
Wait.

3805
02:48:40,400 --> 02:48:42,540
I feel like I'm in such a far place.

3806
02:48:43,080 --> 02:48:44,900
But it's where...

3807
02:48:44,900 --> 02:48:47,480
Why the fuck is the autosave here?

3808
02:48:50,500 --> 02:48:50,980
Okay.

3809
02:48:51,080 --> 02:48:51,680
That's stupid.

3810
02:48:52,180 --> 02:48:53,060
That's stupid.

3811
02:48:58,630 --> 02:49:00,050
No, I got a little worried.

3812
02:49:00,170 --> 02:49:01,050
I was like...

3813
02:49:01,050 --> 02:49:01,490
Oh my God.

3814
02:49:01,590 --> 02:49:01,970
I swear to God.

3815
02:49:02,130 --> 02:49:03,310
If it like takes me to...

3816
02:49:03,310 --> 02:49:03,950
20 years ago.

3817
02:49:04,390 --> 02:49:04,650
I...

3818
02:49:10,300 --> 02:49:10,780
Okay.

3819
02:49:11,160 --> 02:49:12,960
I won't be as cocky this time.

3820
02:49:12,960 --> 02:49:13,420
I swear.

3821
02:49:14,880 --> 02:49:16,020
I swear to God.

3822
02:49:16,760 --> 02:49:17,520
I got...

3823
02:49:17,520 --> 02:49:19,140
I just play my magical flute.

3824
02:49:22,370 --> 02:49:22,850
Okay.

3825
02:49:24,410 --> 02:49:26,990
Magic power of music by my side.

3826
02:49:28,730 --> 02:49:29,410
Let's go.

3827
02:49:31,570 --> 02:49:32,370
That's right.

3828
02:49:32,530 --> 02:49:33,250
Music time.

3829
02:49:34,690 --> 02:49:35,570
That's right.

3830
02:49:36,930 --> 02:49:37,870
That's right.

3831
02:49:38,190 --> 02:49:38,370
That's right.

3832
02:49:43,360 --> 02:49:45,340
The power of Grayskull.

3833
02:49:47,960 --> 02:49:48,560
Okay.

3834
02:49:50,600 --> 02:49:51,200
Alright.

3835
02:49:51,300 --> 02:49:51,500
Nice.

3836
02:49:52,040 --> 02:49:52,380
Oh.

3837
02:49:54,340 --> 02:49:55,140
Oh fuck.

3838
02:49:55,360 --> 02:49:56,060
I thought I had more.

3839
02:49:57,180 --> 02:49:57,640
Okay.

3840
02:49:57,860 --> 02:49:58,460
Maybe...

3841
02:49:58,460 --> 02:49:58,540
Alright.

3842
02:49:58,760 --> 02:49:59,880
Just to be safe.

3843
02:49:59,880 --> 02:50:01,440
Let me use my medicine.

3844
02:50:01,500 --> 02:50:02,980
Just to be safe.

3845
02:50:03,700 --> 02:50:04,560
Let me use my medicine.

3846
02:50:06,140 --> 02:50:06,880
Hammer!

3847
02:50:08,120 --> 02:50:08,860
Hammer!

3848
02:50:10,640 --> 02:50:11,340
Hammer!

3849
02:50:11,860 --> 02:50:13,820
I don't care.

3850
02:50:15,460 --> 02:50:15,720
Nice.

3851
02:50:16,040 --> 02:50:16,620
There you go.

3852
02:50:17,600 --> 02:50:18,860
I had...

3853
02:50:18,860 --> 02:50:20,040
Just to be safe situation.

3854
02:50:23,880 --> 02:50:24,400
Oh.

3855
02:50:27,760 --> 02:50:28,880
Now I care.

3856
02:50:29,080 --> 02:50:30,600
I was the one that killed him.

3857
02:50:32,500 --> 02:50:34,200
You've become so strong.

3858
02:50:34,240 --> 02:50:35,660
Great Assurge in my ass.

3859
02:50:35,980 --> 02:50:37,300
He just had a barrier.

3860
02:50:37,920 --> 02:50:38,680
Look at...

3861
02:50:38,680 --> 02:50:39,080
Look at that.

3862
02:50:39,160 --> 02:50:41,920
This is what happens if you commit all to defense guys.

3863
02:50:42,600 --> 02:50:43,020
See?

3864
02:50:43,280 --> 02:50:44,980
What did defense do for him?

3865
02:50:48,040 --> 02:50:49,360
Say my name.

3866
02:50:49,420 --> 02:50:49,920
Say my name.

3867
02:50:50,800 --> 02:50:52,200
I did that!

3868
02:50:54,400 --> 02:50:56,300
What is my name again?

3869
02:50:57,480 --> 02:50:58,820
Oh my god.

3870
02:50:59,320 --> 02:51:00,540
The greatest swordsman of all the demons.

3871
02:51:00,980 --> 02:51:02,840
The greatest swordsman.

3872
02:51:06,840 --> 02:51:09,340
That's all I wanted, Jufay.

3873
02:51:10,080 --> 02:51:13,760
All I wanted was you to say my name.

3874
02:51:17,300 --> 02:51:18,760
Oh my god.

3875
02:51:19,460 --> 02:51:20,880
I did it.

3876
02:51:21,200 --> 02:51:21,680
Oh shit.

3877
02:51:22,020 --> 02:51:22,340
Oh my god.

3878
02:51:22,480 --> 02:51:22,840
That's a lot.

3879
02:51:23,240 --> 02:51:24,200
That's all.

3880
02:51:24,340 --> 02:51:26,060
That's all he wanted.

3881
02:51:26,560 --> 02:51:27,940
From Jubei.

3882
02:51:27,940 --> 02:51:30,860
I gave him his final wish.

3883
02:51:33,340 --> 02:51:34,540
Your respect.

3884
02:51:37,740 --> 02:51:38,660
Is it here?

3885
02:51:39,060 --> 02:51:39,420
Yeah.

3886
02:51:42,800 --> 02:51:46,380
I will name my kid after you, Gogodontas.

3887
02:51:46,520 --> 02:51:49,400
And then all the villagers will be like, What the fuck?

3888
02:51:49,560 --> 02:51:52,140
Isn't that that demon that slayed thousands of people?

3889
02:51:52,460 --> 02:51:55,220
And I'll be like, he was the greatest...

3890
02:51:55,220 --> 02:51:56,240
He was...

3891
02:51:56,240 --> 02:51:58,480
He was the greatest swordsman.

3892
02:52:02,280 --> 02:52:04,040
Wait, there was like a chest here.

3893
02:52:07,200 --> 02:52:08,160
It's like...

3894
02:52:09,120 --> 02:52:10,520
It's like that one scene.

3895
02:52:10,660 --> 02:52:11,080
What was it?

3896
02:52:11,180 --> 02:52:13,100
In like, Harry Potter or some shit?

3897
02:52:13,220 --> 02:52:16,300
Where like, he named his kids after like, fucking...

3898
02:52:20,280 --> 02:52:21,240
Evil people.

3899
02:52:21,620 --> 02:52:23,540
People are like, no, but he redeemed himself.

3900
02:52:23,720 --> 02:52:24,860
He's not evil no more.

3901
02:52:28,220 --> 02:52:28,980
It's different.

3902
02:52:29,120 --> 02:52:30,040
Oh, whoa, that hurts me.

3903
02:52:32,760 --> 02:52:34,760
And they're terrible names too, by the way.

3904
02:52:34,860 --> 02:52:36,560
Those are some fucking terrible names.

3905
02:52:44,960 --> 02:52:46,840
Oh, Zekra, thank you for the super chat.

3906
02:52:47,020 --> 02:52:47,280
Thank you.

3907
02:52:47,420 --> 02:52:47,940
Thank you.

3908
02:52:48,360 --> 02:52:51,300
Salute to the greatest swordsman of all the demons.

3909
02:52:56,670 --> 02:52:57,130
Alright.

3910
02:52:57,450 --> 02:52:57,750
Let's go.

3911
02:52:59,890 --> 02:53:00,350
Goodbye.

3912
02:53:01,790 --> 02:53:02,250
Gogodontas.

3913
02:53:07,940 --> 02:53:10,840
One last puzzle for the ride.

3914
02:53:13,110 --> 02:53:13,600
Christ.

3915
02:53:14,160 --> 02:53:16,500
He was truly the greatest, guys.

3916
02:53:17,160 --> 02:53:18,900
The greatest demon.

3917
02:53:20,330 --> 02:53:21,180
Out there.

3918
02:53:30,180 --> 02:53:30,670
What?

3919
02:53:31,160 --> 02:53:33,010
Okay, I got one side.

3920
02:53:40,250 --> 02:53:40,890
Oh, okay.

3921
02:53:40,990 --> 02:53:41,370
There we go.

3922
02:53:42,390 --> 02:53:42,610
Oh, okay.

3923
02:53:43,170 --> 02:53:44,430
What about the other side?

3924
02:53:50,600 --> 02:53:51,420
Oh, okay.

3925
02:53:51,440 --> 02:53:52,280
I'm just stupid.

3926
02:53:52,640 --> 02:53:53,260
Okay, I got it.

3927
02:53:53,880 --> 02:53:54,420
There we go.

3928
02:53:54,920 --> 02:53:56,260
I keep missing one step.

3929
02:53:57,480 --> 02:53:57,920
Yay!

3930
02:53:58,820 --> 02:54:00,560
I was just missing one step of it.

3931
02:54:01,860 --> 02:54:02,520
Look at that.

3932
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:05,180
Look at that, guys.

3933
02:54:06,840 --> 02:54:06,940
Look at that, guys.

3934
02:54:06,940 --> 02:54:07,340
That's right.

3935
02:54:07,620 --> 02:54:09,740
This is who you made fun of in high school.

3936
02:54:10,080 --> 02:54:11,040
Look at her now.

3937
02:54:11,560 --> 02:54:12,400
Look at her now!

3938
02:54:12,580 --> 02:54:13,200
Say her name!

3939
02:54:14,060 --> 02:54:14,900
Say her name!

3940
02:54:18,440 --> 02:54:19,980
What's my name?

3941
02:54:28,420 --> 02:54:28,900
What's my name?

3942
02:54:28,900 --> 02:54:29,860
Is that a song?

3943
02:54:30,120 --> 02:54:30,740
Say my name.

3944
02:54:33,120 --> 02:54:34,160
That was a song.

3945
02:54:34,340 --> 02:54:34,840
I know it.

3946
02:54:36,100 --> 02:54:37,160
Where the fuck am I?

3947
02:54:37,220 --> 02:54:37,960
Oh, there she is.

3948
02:54:39,480 --> 02:54:40,580
I'm glad you're safe.

3949
02:54:40,800 --> 02:54:42,200
We should get out of here immediately.

3950
02:54:44,120 --> 02:54:45,300
What song was it?

3951
02:54:46,060 --> 02:54:47,140
Oh, I have the orb.

3952
02:54:51,030 --> 02:54:51,490
Yes.

3953
02:54:51,870 --> 02:54:52,470
Oh, I got the...

3954
02:54:52,470 --> 02:54:53,290
Oh, and he has the...

3955
02:54:53,290 --> 02:54:53,790
Of course.

3956
02:54:54,030 --> 02:54:56,770
Of course he has the respect orb.

3957
02:54:58,090 --> 02:55:01,830
Her name is Doki, the greatest swordsman of the birds.

3958
02:55:16,290 --> 02:55:18,650
Alright, what robot's gonna come out this time?

3959
02:55:19,070 --> 02:55:20,290
What is this robot?

3960
02:55:26,750 --> 02:55:29,050
What the fuck is that?

3961
02:55:29,730 --> 02:55:31,190
Is that turtle?

3962
02:55:33,670 --> 02:55:36,270
What's this battle mech that I have?

3963
02:55:36,670 --> 02:55:37,970
My Bakugan.

3964
02:55:53,880 --> 02:55:54,700
Battleship?

3965
02:55:54,820 --> 02:55:57,840
Hey, wait!

3966
02:56:01,360 --> 02:56:03,560
Holy shit, what the fuck?

3967
02:56:05,580 --> 02:56:08,320
It's actually a battleship.

3968
02:56:09,560 --> 02:56:12,000
Oh my god, is that a fucking submarine?

3969
02:56:12,340 --> 02:56:13,780
Who built this?

3970
02:56:14,480 --> 02:56:14,840
Like...

3971
02:56:14,840 --> 02:56:16,440
And it flies?

3972
02:56:19,660 --> 02:56:20,520
Bro, what?

3973
02:56:22,640 --> 02:56:23,840
It flies?

3974
02:56:23,840 --> 02:56:24,080
Eyes?

3975
02:56:31,770 --> 02:56:34,550
Who the fuck built this?

3976
02:56:34,810 --> 02:56:36,350
Is this some alien shit?

3977
02:56:44,890 --> 02:56:47,570
Oh, there's another battleship.

3978
02:56:48,030 --> 02:56:49,170
Battleship Junior.

3979
02:56:52,960 --> 02:56:54,420
No, I don't...

3980
02:56:54,420 --> 02:56:54,540
I don't...

3981
02:56:54,540 --> 02:56:58,720
The craziest part is that I actually don't remember anything about the second game.

3982
02:56:59,160 --> 02:57:01,160
I remember watching my dad play it.

3983
02:57:01,340 --> 02:57:06,220
But for some fucking reason, I did not retain any of the... of this.

3984
02:57:07,040 --> 02:57:08,760
Whatever the fuck this was.

3985
02:57:20,620 --> 02:57:22,940
Yeah, you think I remember this.

3986
02:57:23,200 --> 02:57:24,820
The fucking robot horse.

3987
02:57:25,320 --> 02:57:26,460
Mecha fish.

3988
02:57:26,700 --> 02:57:27,220
And then...

3989
02:57:27,220 --> 02:57:29,020
The flying turtle mech.

3990
02:57:29,660 --> 02:57:30,780
I must get this door open.

3991
02:57:30,780 --> 02:57:31,640
I'll help you.

3992
02:57:31,740 --> 02:57:32,280
Oh no.

3993
02:57:33,560 --> 02:57:34,620
This is timed.

3994
02:57:35,340 --> 02:57:36,180
Oh no.

3995
02:57:36,960 --> 02:57:38,280
OH NO!

3996
02:57:39,800 --> 02:57:41,280
Time puzzles!

3997
02:57:44,300 --> 02:57:46,860
I'll try the left handle in the opposite direction.

3998
02:57:47,340 --> 02:57:47,800
Let's go.

3999
02:57:52,420 --> 02:57:54,380
Wait, I thought you were gonna...

4000
02:57:59,550 --> 02:58:01,290
What do you mean?

4001
02:58:05,070 --> 02:58:08,650
Oh my god, you're not... I have to beat both of you?

4002
02:58:14,760 --> 02:58:15,360
Okay.

4003
02:58:16,800 --> 02:58:17,820
Oh my god.

4004
02:58:19,640 --> 02:58:20,760
Oh my god.

4005
02:58:21,960 --> 02:58:23,280
This is so stupid.

4006
02:58:23,520 --> 02:58:25,060
I have to beat both of them.

4007
02:58:25,300 --> 02:58:29,160
I thought, you know... I thought the NPC would help me.

4008
02:58:29,360 --> 02:58:30,800
But I was wrong.

4009
02:58:34,650 --> 02:58:35,250
Please.

4010
02:58:35,730 --> 02:58:36,950
Please, we're almost there.

4011
02:58:37,070 --> 02:58:37,650
Are you...

4012
02:58:54,960 --> 02:58:56,440
Are you sure?

4013
02:58:58,900 --> 02:59:00,180
Yes, I'm sure.

4014
02:59:00,300 --> 02:59:00,860
What do you mean?

4015
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:04,140
Are you gonna make the puzzle easier for me?

4016
02:59:08,360 --> 02:59:10,760
What do you mean?

4017
02:59:11,280 --> 02:59:13,440
Are you just gonna make this puzzle easier?

4018
02:59:14,720 --> 02:59:20,380
Like... I fucked up one puzzle.

4019
02:59:21,200 --> 02:59:21,800
Okay.

4020
02:59:22,360 --> 02:59:22,960
Okay.

4021
02:59:22,960 --> 02:59:25,260
Okay, I fucked up one puzzle.

4022
02:59:34,700 --> 02:59:36,920
Just the one puzzle.

4023
02:59:37,940 --> 02:59:38,420
What?

4024
02:59:38,640 --> 02:59:39,980
How are they gonna make it easy?

4025
02:59:40,120 --> 02:59:42,080
Like, I just don't have to do a puzzle anymore.

4026
02:59:42,080 --> 02:59:42,880
Like...

4027
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:46,780
I don't know.

4028
02:59:47,040 --> 02:59:49,680
I... She was like, I'll turn the left one.

4029
02:59:49,720 --> 02:59:50,440
You turn the right.

4030
02:59:50,520 --> 02:59:51,080
So I assume...

4031
02:59:52,060 --> 02:59:53,120
I'll try the left hand.

4032
02:59:53,120 --> 02:59:55,180
Like, you know, she says, I'll do it.

4033
02:59:56,320 --> 03:00:01,460
So, obviously, like, you think, like, the NPC will do it for you, you know?

4034
03:00:04,840 --> 03:00:09,220
Like, it just sounded like the NPC was actually gonna help me there.

4035
03:00:11,780 --> 03:00:13,780
But silly me for thinking that!

4036
03:00:16,720 --> 03:00:17,840
She's... Like, I don't know.

4037
03:00:17,960 --> 03:00:19,200
I didn't think I'd control both.

4038
03:00:25,490 --> 03:00:26,330
Oh my god, please.

4039
03:00:26,470 --> 03:00:27,530
I'm trying my best here.

4040
03:00:33,760 --> 03:00:34,640
There we go.

4041
03:00:34,900 --> 03:00:35,560
There we go.

4042
03:00:35,820 --> 03:00:37,520
Never trust the NPC.

4043
03:00:42,900 --> 03:00:43,460
Okay.

4044
03:00:46,200 --> 03:00:47,900
Such a difficult puzzle.

4045
03:00:48,020 --> 03:00:50,320
Are you sure you don't want to do this puzzle in easy mode?

4046
03:00:54,860 --> 03:00:56,160
That's so fucked up.

4047
03:00:56,540 --> 03:00:58,280
That's actually so fucked up.

4048
03:01:02,780 --> 03:01:05,080
I can't believe he asked me.

4049
03:01:06,880 --> 03:01:09,700
Oh my god, I'm like, the right brothers.

4050
03:01:17,060 --> 03:01:19,260
What the fuck was that sound?

4051
03:01:19,740 --> 03:01:19,880
What?

4052
03:01:22,160 --> 03:01:23,120
Don't worry.

4053
03:01:24,300 --> 03:01:25,900
I won't let you die.

4054
03:01:26,320 --> 03:01:28,900
I still need to make Nobunaga angry.

4055
03:01:43,650 --> 03:01:45,170
That's why we don't have...

4056
03:01:45,170 --> 03:01:46,070
That's why, like...

4057
03:01:46,710 --> 03:01:48,810
Japan didn't invent the first flying machine.

4058
03:01:49,490 --> 03:01:51,110
Jubei fucked it up for all of us.

4059
03:01:51,810 --> 03:01:52,330
I still...

4060
03:01:52,330 --> 03:01:53,630
Yeah, I still need to get revenge.

4061
03:01:54,090 --> 03:01:54,550
Don't worry.

4062
03:01:59,660 --> 03:02:01,260
I need to, like, have him see.

4063
03:02:04,640 --> 03:02:09,740
I bring her closer to her brother so he can watch and see.

4064
03:02:10,980 --> 03:02:11,800
That's right.

4065
03:02:18,650 --> 03:02:20,170
The greatest revenge.

4066
03:02:25,400 --> 03:02:27,460
Okay, I need to make sure what's back here, though.

4067
03:02:28,100 --> 03:02:29,160
What is back here?

4068
03:02:29,500 --> 03:02:30,360
Okay, I knew it.

4069
03:02:30,540 --> 03:02:30,800
Oh, fuck.

4070
03:02:30,940 --> 03:02:31,260
God.

4071
03:02:31,480 --> 03:02:32,560
No, it's six.

4072
03:02:32,820 --> 03:02:33,300
No.

4073
03:02:33,300 --> 03:02:34,120
Oh, no.

4074
03:02:34,540 --> 03:02:36,380
My greatest weakness.

4075
03:02:36,860 --> 03:02:38,020
Six moves.

4076
03:02:42,490 --> 03:02:43,470
Oh, no.

4077
03:02:43,910 --> 03:02:44,450
No.

4078
03:02:45,270 --> 03:02:45,830
No.

4079
03:02:47,110 --> 03:02:47,370
No.

4080
03:02:53,600 --> 03:02:55,120
Not six moves.

4081
03:02:55,960 --> 03:02:57,420
Anything but that.

4082
03:03:04,340 --> 03:03:05,480
Oh, I did it.

4083
03:03:05,480 --> 03:03:05,760
Yeah!

4084
03:03:06,160 --> 03:03:07,760
Oh my god, I actually did it!

4085
03:03:08,180 --> 03:03:09,020
Holy fuck!

4086
03:03:09,420 --> 03:03:11,780
Oh my god, I'm so fucking smart!

4087
03:03:13,520 --> 03:03:14,980
I actually did it!

4088
03:03:15,220 --> 03:03:17,400
Oh my god, I actually did it!

4089
03:03:17,540 --> 03:03:18,440
No way!

4090
03:03:19,900 --> 03:03:21,180
I almost used it.

4091
03:03:22,780 --> 03:03:25,040
Oh my god, it's actually a Christmas miracle.

4092
03:03:28,220 --> 03:03:29,520
Okay, I need a save though.

4093
03:03:29,840 --> 03:03:31,580
I don't want- I don't remember how I did it.

4094
03:03:32,520 --> 03:03:34,240
I actually- I don't remember it.

4095
03:03:34,380 --> 03:03:36,280
We can't- we have to save.

4096
03:03:44,490 --> 03:03:45,810
Oh my god, get out of here.

4097
03:03:54,670 --> 03:03:55,710
Get out of here.

4098
03:03:56,090 --> 03:03:57,450
Oh my god!

4099
03:03:58,390 --> 03:03:59,210
Where are you?

4100
03:04:00,990 --> 03:04:01,810
Where are you?

4101
03:04:02,910 --> 03:04:03,630
Get out!

4102
03:04:07,030 --> 03:04:08,810
Alright, as long as he's out of the way.

4103
03:04:12,730 --> 03:04:13,970
Oh, nice medicine.

4104
03:04:14,490 --> 03:04:15,850
We gotta stockpile that.

4105
03:04:17,410 --> 03:04:18,330
Where am I?

4106
03:04:18,330 --> 03:04:18,670
How do I?

4107
03:04:19,230 --> 03:04:20,270
Where am I?

4108
03:04:21,230 --> 03:04:21,970
Over here.

4109
03:04:25,050 --> 03:04:25,510
What?

4110
03:04:26,290 --> 03:04:27,450
Where do- yeah.

4111
03:04:28,050 --> 03:04:28,870
Oh shit!

4112
03:04:29,230 --> 03:04:29,850
Oh shit!

4113
03:04:30,070 --> 03:04:31,050
Oh shit!

4114
03:04:34,450 --> 03:04:35,710
Yeah, I'm not fighting those.

4115
03:04:36,730 --> 03:04:38,630
I don't care.

4116
03:04:39,350 --> 03:04:39,810
Actually...

4117
03:04:42,570 --> 03:04:43,010
Okay.

4118
03:04:44,830 --> 03:04:47,970
Okay, if I line them up, it might be worth it.

4119
03:04:50,470 --> 03:04:51,530
Nice, I knew it.

4120
03:04:51,770 --> 03:04:52,330
See guys?

4121
03:04:52,950 --> 03:04:54,230
I figured it out.

4122
03:04:55,230 --> 03:04:56,230
Wait, there's one more.

4123
03:04:56,710 --> 03:04:57,810
Wait, there's more of them?

4124
03:05:01,920 --> 03:05:03,280
Okay, I figured it out though.

4125
03:05:03,280 --> 03:05:05,540
Oh, oh no, no, no, no, no!

4126
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:17,440
Okay.

4127
03:05:18,900 --> 03:05:20,980
I didn't expect to see all of these guys.

4128
03:05:21,780 --> 03:05:23,420
Okay, that's a lot of them.

4129
03:05:23,660 --> 03:05:24,460
Okay, um...

4130
03:05:25,300 --> 03:05:27,240
Oh, that is a lot more.

4131
03:05:27,860 --> 03:05:29,040
Oh my god!

4132
03:05:29,320 --> 03:05:30,300
Oh my god!

4133
03:05:31,040 --> 03:05:31,540
Okay.

4134
03:05:33,640 --> 03:05:35,360
Okay, that's a lot more than I expected.

4135
03:05:40,960 --> 03:05:42,030
Wait, there's more?!

4136
03:05:42,500 --> 03:05:43,200
Oh no!

4137
03:05:43,420 --> 03:05:43,980
Oh no!

4138
03:05:44,160 --> 03:05:44,840
Okay, that's enough.

4139
03:05:44,840 --> 03:05:45,580
I'm done.

4140
03:05:49,260 --> 03:05:50,720
I had my fun.

4141
03:06:03,280 --> 03:06:05,880
Wait, they spawned during pauses?!

4142
03:06:06,660 --> 03:06:07,100
Okay.

4143
03:06:07,680 --> 03:06:08,780
Yeah, I was like, you know what?

4144
03:06:08,920 --> 03:06:10,220
No, you know they can have this.

4145
03:06:14,300 --> 03:06:17,760
Well, the turbinus conveniently led me to the exit.

4146
03:06:18,260 --> 03:06:19,780
How lovely, how wonderful.

4147
03:06:20,520 --> 03:06:21,820
Oh, there you are.

4148
03:06:22,060 --> 03:06:23,440
Where the fuck were you?

4149
03:06:25,180 --> 03:06:26,940
You think I know how to drive?

4150
03:06:27,860 --> 03:06:29,540
I've never seen this either.

4151
03:06:29,720 --> 03:06:32,280
I don't think anybody in Japan knows how to fucking drive this.

4152
03:06:32,360 --> 03:06:34,120
You think I've seen a flying machine before?

4153
03:06:35,100 --> 03:06:35,540
Like...

4154
03:06:37,820 --> 03:06:39,920
Like, it's like, I don't know how to drive this.

4155
03:06:40,100 --> 03:06:41,920
Like, you think I know either?!

4156
03:06:41,920 --> 03:06:44,260
We both saw this for the first time!

4157
03:06:47,760 --> 03:06:50,980
I don't know how to drive, Lord Nobunaga will conquer the entire country!

4158
03:06:51,320 --> 03:06:52,820
You should just give up now!

4159
03:06:53,320 --> 03:06:53,880
Silence!

4160
03:06:54,280 --> 03:06:59,120
It is the first order of the Yagyu clan to stop all demons from the underworld.

4161
03:06:59,820 --> 03:07:02,640
Now, prepare yourself, Tokuchiro!

4162
03:07:02,880 --> 03:07:07,000
Wait, wait, if you really want this ship, I shall give it to you!

4163
03:07:07,060 --> 03:07:07,860
Wait, is that easy?

4164
03:07:08,840 --> 03:07:09,400
Oh!

4165
03:07:09,820 --> 03:07:11,640
Never mind, it wasn't that easy.

4166
03:07:13,180 --> 03:07:14,500
Enjoy your ride!

4167
03:07:14,800 --> 03:07:15,360
What?!

4168
03:07:15,360 --> 03:07:16,320
Does he fucking invent...

4169
03:07:16,320 --> 03:07:16,500
Oh!

4170
03:07:17,320 --> 03:07:17,880
What?!

4171
03:07:18,600 --> 03:07:19,800
What the fuck?!

4172
03:07:21,320 --> 03:07:23,200
Oh, that's a lot of demons!

4173
03:07:24,120 --> 03:07:25,340
Oh my god!

4174
03:07:27,240 --> 03:07:31,560
I was like, does he invent the fucking first ever parachute too?!

4175
03:07:31,560 --> 03:07:32,680
Like, what's happening?!

4176
03:07:34,640 --> 03:07:36,340
Oh, see, she knows how to drive.

4177
03:07:38,060 --> 03:07:39,380
Apparently it was that easy.

4178
03:07:44,550 --> 03:07:45,390
I must do something.

4179
03:07:46,890 --> 03:07:47,430
What?

4180
03:07:49,290 --> 03:07:51,290
Maybe check the instruments over here?

4181
03:07:51,990 --> 03:07:52,490
Here?

4182
03:07:53,490 --> 03:07:54,550
Did I do it?

4183
03:07:55,490 --> 03:07:56,970
We can attack with this.

4184
03:07:57,430 --> 03:07:58,390
Do you know what you're doing?

4185
03:07:58,770 --> 03:08:00,470
Yeah, I'm gonna say, do I know what I'm doing?

4186
03:08:01,290 --> 03:08:03,770
Just believe in the heart of the cards.

4187
03:08:06,230 --> 03:08:07,930
Just press any buttons.

4188
03:08:08,330 --> 03:08:09,670
Let's go, Jubei!

4189
03:08:09,850 --> 03:08:10,670
Just press...

4190
03:08:12,190 --> 03:08:13,650
What the fuck?!

4191
03:08:16,940 --> 03:08:17,540
See?

4192
03:08:18,500 --> 03:08:19,640
We did it!

4193
03:08:20,360 --> 03:08:21,220
Wait, that...

4194
03:08:21,220 --> 03:08:22,440
That actually worked!

4195
03:08:26,000 --> 03:08:27,900
It was just that easy.

4196
03:08:29,400 --> 03:08:30,660
Curse that Tokijiro!

4197
03:08:32,900 --> 03:08:33,500
Wait...

4198
03:08:33,500 --> 03:08:36,000
I like, I was like, I can't believe he would do this!

4199
03:08:36,140 --> 03:08:40,720
I say as I press all the buttons to activate self-destruct mode.

4200
03:08:40,720 --> 03:08:41,600
Must die.

4201
03:08:44,900 --> 03:08:46,560
It's his fault!

4202
03:08:46,940 --> 03:08:48,100
Not mine!

4203
03:09:00,890 --> 03:09:02,410
It's like that bicycle meme.

4204
03:09:09,680 --> 03:09:11,020
You can't die!

4205
03:09:11,500 --> 03:09:11,800
No!

4206
03:09:14,260 --> 03:09:14,920
My revenge!

4207
03:09:17,380 --> 03:09:22,480
I guess killing his sister is sort of like revenge, but it's not as cool.

4208
03:09:24,320 --> 03:09:25,920
It's not as good.

4209
03:09:30,050 --> 03:09:31,050
Can't believe it.

4210
03:09:31,130 --> 03:09:32,510
All she had to do was jump.

4211
03:09:33,850 --> 03:09:36,150
Bro, why can't you dump jump?

4212
03:09:36,430 --> 03:09:37,270
Is she stupid?

4213
03:09:37,270 --> 03:09:41,070
She unbinded her jump button.

4214
03:09:41,930 --> 03:09:43,190
Can't believe it.

4215
03:09:44,190 --> 03:09:47,250
I can't believe she forgot to bind her jump button.

4216
03:09:47,990 --> 03:09:48,950
Wait, who's that?

4217
03:09:49,390 --> 03:09:50,070
Is that the...

4218
03:09:50,070 --> 03:09:51,210
Oh, that's the drunk guy!

4219
03:09:55,130 --> 03:09:56,610
Wait, I have gourds!

4220
03:09:58,390 --> 03:09:59,050
I'm welcome!

4221
03:10:12,200 --> 03:10:14,040
Am I actually fighting him?

4222
03:10:15,520 --> 03:10:16,700
Are you serious?

4223
03:10:17,300 --> 03:10:19,240
If so, I will not.

4224
03:10:22,480 --> 03:10:23,740
Are you ready, Jumei?

4225
03:10:24,380 --> 03:10:27,400
Ready to face the master of the Halloween Spear?

4226
03:10:27,520 --> 03:10:28,760
Oh, my relationship was too low.

4227
03:10:28,940 --> 03:10:29,440
Okay!

4228
03:10:32,560 --> 03:10:33,600
Like, how?

4229
03:10:33,900 --> 03:10:35,940
Like, okay, all I'm saying, like...

4230
03:10:36,460 --> 03:10:38,900
It's not my fault I picked the wrong woman.

4231
03:10:43,100 --> 03:10:44,140
Look, I...

4232
03:10:44,140 --> 03:10:45,280
I fucked up!

4233
03:10:46,200 --> 03:10:47,100
Wait, what?

4234
03:10:50,340 --> 03:10:50,840
What?

4235
03:10:55,080 --> 03:10:55,580
What?

4236
03:10:55,580 --> 03:10:55,980
Wait, what?

4237
03:10:56,800 --> 03:10:57,020
What?

4238
03:11:03,190 --> 03:11:04,590
Okay, it's not...

4239
03:11:04,590 --> 03:11:06,450
No, we're not doing a fair fight.

4240
03:11:06,670 --> 03:11:07,410
We're not...

4241
03:11:13,910 --> 03:11:17,870
I was like, you want to make this fair?

4242
03:11:18,510 --> 03:11:20,890
No, demon more time.

4243
03:11:27,770 --> 03:11:32,530
If I can't use my demon sword, I'll just use demon gun.

4244
03:11:43,660 --> 03:11:45,860
Don't say such things.

4245
03:11:48,160 --> 03:11:50,920
So anyway, I started blasting.

4246
03:11:55,350 --> 03:11:56,070
No!

4247
03:11:56,530 --> 03:11:59,950
All those gourds that I fucking found!

4248
03:12:03,190 --> 03:12:03,910
No!

4249
03:12:08,610 --> 03:12:10,950
Please, I have the gourds!

4250
03:12:11,090 --> 03:12:11,890
Just take them!

4251
03:12:16,020 --> 03:12:17,480
Oh, he's crying.

4252
03:12:17,840 --> 03:12:19,220
Because I fucking killed him.

4253
03:12:21,500 --> 03:12:23,140
That looks like a penis.

4254
03:12:25,020 --> 03:12:26,580
He looks quite peaceful.

4255
03:12:26,940 --> 03:12:28,980
Is this the way you want it to go, Ike?

4256
03:12:31,680 --> 03:12:33,000
Okay, what did I get?

4257
03:12:33,180 --> 03:12:33,960
What is that?

4258
03:12:35,040 --> 03:12:36,360
This is also a gift?

4259
03:12:38,360 --> 03:12:39,480
Wait, where is it?

4260
03:12:39,720 --> 03:12:41,420
Where's the thing I stole from him?

4261
03:12:42,320 --> 03:12:42,860
Oh, there we go.

4262
03:12:46,510 --> 03:12:47,290
That's his chain!

4263
03:12:57,200 --> 03:12:57,940
Oh, shit.

4264
03:12:59,020 --> 03:12:59,500
Wait!

4265
03:13:00,460 --> 03:13:01,220
Can I...

4266
03:13:01,220 --> 03:13:03,620
Okay, I was gonna say, like...

4267
03:13:04,380 --> 03:13:05,740
I don't care about honor.

4268
03:13:06,260 --> 03:13:07,440
I need my magic.

4269
03:13:08,180 --> 03:13:09,500
It's magic time.

4270
03:13:13,660 --> 03:13:14,740
Okay, nice.

4271
03:13:17,600 --> 03:13:19,220
Yeah, I was like, gift?

4272
03:13:20,560 --> 03:13:21,440
Yeah, gift.

4273
03:13:23,640 --> 03:13:24,340
That's right.

4274
03:13:26,780 --> 03:13:28,400
He gave it to me, guys.

4275
03:13:28,540 --> 03:13:28,840
Right...

4276
03:13:28,840 --> 03:13:30,560
He's told me to keep it, guys.

4277
03:13:30,580 --> 03:13:31,680
Right before he died.

4278
03:13:31,800 --> 03:13:32,440
I swear to God.

4279
03:13:37,490 --> 03:13:38,190
Oh, shit.

4280
03:13:38,190 --> 03:13:39,090
How did I do that?

4281
03:13:40,410 --> 03:13:42,390
Oh my god, the crit gives so much.

4282
03:13:42,570 --> 03:13:44,370
I wish I know how to do that consistently.

4283
03:13:44,850 --> 03:13:47,050
If only I know how to do that.

4284
03:13:52,430 --> 03:13:53,550
Alright, get out of here.

4285
03:13:55,870 --> 03:13:56,270
Nice.

4286
03:13:59,350 --> 03:14:00,010
Anything here?

4287
03:14:00,270 --> 03:14:00,730
Okay, wait.

4288
03:14:01,870 --> 03:14:02,710
Try this first.

4289
03:14:04,930 --> 03:14:05,750
Okay, yeah, no.

4290
03:14:05,870 --> 03:14:06,430
Get out of here.

4291
03:14:07,550 --> 03:14:08,730
Oh no, I don't think I have enough.

4292
03:14:10,690 --> 03:14:11,370
Fuck, okay.

4293
03:14:13,330 --> 03:14:13,690
Uh...

4294
03:14:15,370 --> 03:14:16,430
Oh no.

4295
03:14:18,050 --> 03:14:18,650
Alright.

4296
03:14:19,050 --> 03:14:20,490
Let me figure out how to use gun.

4297
03:14:23,310 --> 03:14:23,910
Oh.

4298
03:14:24,110 --> 03:14:24,930
Wait, is that easy?

4299
03:14:25,610 --> 03:14:26,210
Wait!

4300
03:14:26,510 --> 03:14:28,030
Wait, it was that easy?

4301
03:14:28,550 --> 03:14:29,430
Oh shit.

4302
03:14:30,550 --> 03:14:31,710
Should've used gun more.

4303
03:14:34,630 --> 03:14:35,470
That's it.

4304
03:14:36,890 --> 03:14:38,190
I just shoot it.

4305
03:14:38,510 --> 03:14:41,090
Oh my god, it's a 5 plus room again.

4306
03:14:41,670 --> 03:14:43,750
Just a stupid 5 plus area.

4307
03:14:48,860 --> 03:14:49,340
Okay.

4308
03:14:50,640 --> 03:14:53,560
Do I go up the ladder or do I go right side?

4309
03:14:53,800 --> 03:14:55,460
Or do I go out and go the other way?

4310
03:14:55,700 --> 03:14:56,100
Chat.

4311
03:14:56,940 --> 03:14:58,660
I don't have a map so I don't know.

4312
03:15:01,760 --> 03:15:02,720
Do I...

4313
03:15:02,720 --> 03:15:03,820
Up the ladder?

4314
03:15:04,120 --> 03:15:04,560
Okay.

4315
03:15:06,300 --> 03:15:07,380
What the fuck?

4316
03:15:09,000 --> 03:15:10,440
Am I shooting it?

4317
03:15:10,560 --> 03:15:11,740
Oh my god, I can't tell.

4318
03:15:14,600 --> 03:15:15,320
Like...

4319
03:15:15,320 --> 03:15:16,340
Are they getting shot?

4320
03:15:16,940 --> 03:15:18,420
I can't...

4321
03:15:18,420 --> 03:15:18,780
Ow!

4322
03:15:18,960 --> 03:15:19,540
Fucking no!

4323
03:15:22,450 --> 03:15:23,870
Oh my god.

4324
03:15:26,870 --> 03:15:28,830
Okay, I have enough for a tornado.

4325
03:15:29,790 --> 03:15:30,370
That's fine.

4326
03:15:32,330 --> 03:15:32,950
There we go.

4327
03:15:34,350 --> 03:15:35,290
Just enough.

4328
03:15:37,390 --> 03:15:38,610
Oh, thank god.

4329
03:15:41,720 --> 03:15:43,180
Very slowly.

4330
03:15:43,880 --> 03:15:45,340
Can my...

4331
03:15:45,340 --> 03:15:46,820
People hit him with the eyes?

4332
03:15:48,600 --> 03:15:49,820
Jesus Christ.

4333
03:15:50,520 --> 03:15:50,960
Thanks.

4334
03:15:51,420 --> 03:15:51,760
No!

4335
03:15:54,580 --> 03:15:56,260
Okay, fire arrow.

4336
03:15:58,820 --> 03:15:59,700
I hate them.

4337
03:16:00,700 --> 03:16:02,680
Oh my god, you fuckers.

4338
03:16:10,700 --> 03:16:12,080
I don't know.

4339
03:16:13,500 --> 03:16:15,400
I don't know.

4340
03:16:15,700 --> 03:16:16,160
I don't know!

4341
03:16:16,160 --> 03:16:16,640
That's it!

4342
03:16:17,360 --> 03:16:19,060
I'm mad now!

4343
03:16:19,760 --> 03:16:20,720
That's it!

4344
03:16:21,260 --> 03:16:22,460
I'm mad!

4345
03:16:27,020 --> 03:16:29,040
I don't know how to kill him.

4346
03:16:29,100 --> 03:16:30,820
How do I kill him?

4347
03:16:33,480 --> 03:16:35,220
How do I kill him?

4348
03:16:37,640 --> 03:16:39,140
How is it sick?

4349
03:16:45,270 --> 03:16:46,210
Don't understand!

4350
03:16:56,440 --> 03:16:57,560
I have more.

4351
03:17:02,760 --> 03:17:03,240
Okay.

4352
03:17:06,610 --> 03:17:07,270
Okay.

4353
03:17:11,880 --> 03:17:14,940
I missed two times and I had a popstick.

4354
03:17:17,560 --> 03:17:19,480
Oh my God, I'm shooting the fire!

4355
03:17:23,040 --> 03:17:24,480
Oh, it's getting closer!

4356
03:17:25,040 --> 03:17:26,380
Wait, it's fucking finally!

4357
03:17:26,840 --> 03:17:28,280
It's getting closer!

4358
03:17:28,700 --> 03:17:29,820
Thank God!

4359
03:17:30,340 --> 03:17:31,300
Get over here!

4360
03:17:32,380 --> 03:17:33,600
Jesus Christ!

4361
03:17:34,440 --> 03:17:35,400
Oh, I got it.

4362
03:17:35,800 --> 03:17:36,380
Thank God.

4363
03:17:37,040 --> 03:17:38,860
Okay, we got it.

4364
03:17:39,300 --> 03:17:41,420
We fucking got it.

4365
03:17:43,980 --> 03:17:46,260
I was like, am I hitting it?

4366
03:17:48,400 --> 03:17:50,660
Guys, I don't think I was hitting it.

4367
03:17:59,290 --> 03:17:59,850
Wait.

4368
03:18:00,250 --> 03:18:00,670
Okay.

4369
03:18:03,370 --> 03:18:04,730
Oh, I have to go downstairs.

4370
03:18:08,310 --> 03:18:09,450
That's a classic.

4371
03:18:09,830 --> 03:18:10,710
I don't know.

4372
03:18:10,810 --> 03:18:12,550
I thought I was hitting it at first.

4373
03:18:13,430 --> 03:18:15,910
It looked like I was hitting it!

4374
03:18:16,270 --> 03:18:19,090
And I was like, guys, you think I'm hitting it?

4375
03:18:19,090 --> 03:18:21,330
Does it look like I'm hitting it, guys?

4376
03:18:21,330 --> 03:18:22,750
I can't tell.

4377
03:18:25,250 --> 03:18:26,550
Alright, it's time.

4378
03:18:27,510 --> 03:18:27,910
Okay.

4379
03:18:29,470 --> 03:18:31,910
I don't know what this is gonna do.

4380
03:18:32,130 --> 03:18:33,070
But it's time.

4381
03:18:39,450 --> 03:18:41,330
Is it worth it?

4382
03:18:41,450 --> 03:18:43,770
Chat, is it worth it to do this?

4383
03:18:44,210 --> 03:18:45,690
It's 20 floors!

4384
03:18:46,090 --> 03:18:47,270
Is it worth it, chat?

4385
03:18:47,410 --> 03:18:49,570
I need to know before I go down there.

4386
03:18:52,950 --> 03:18:54,770
I get a flame sword?

4387
03:18:55,110 --> 03:18:56,810
Okay, that sounds pretty badass.

4388
03:18:59,630 --> 03:19:00,930
Alright, it's time.

4389
03:19:02,890 --> 03:19:03,570
Yes.

4390
03:19:07,280 --> 03:19:09,640
Okay, that does sound pretty badass.

4391
03:19:10,360 --> 03:19:12,220
So I'll use this for now.

4392
03:19:20,650 --> 03:19:21,130
Okay,

4393
03:19:26,590 --> 03:19:28,630
I also needed the demon stuff, too, anyway.

4394
03:19:29,070 --> 03:19:29,710
That's good.

4395
03:19:31,550 --> 03:19:32,030
Oh!

4396
03:19:39,420 --> 03:19:43,700
Okay, I might not use my magic until I'm, like, way deep in there.

4397
03:19:44,460 --> 03:19:46,920
But it doesn't feel like it's worth it at this point.

4398
03:19:51,420 --> 03:19:52,520
Okay, I need that.

4399
03:19:52,600 --> 03:19:53,320
That's magic, though.

4400
03:19:56,360 --> 03:19:58,240
All you get is a t-shirt.

4401
03:19:58,440 --> 03:20:00,840
If you do the math, if you do this.

4402
03:20:01,920 --> 03:20:02,960
Are you serious?

4403
03:20:04,520 --> 03:20:06,260
I'm gonna get the sword, actually.

4404
03:20:11,070 --> 03:20:11,590
Alright.

4405
03:20:12,030 --> 03:20:12,370
Nice.

4406
03:20:13,090 --> 03:20:14,010
Down I go.

4407
03:20:20,020 --> 03:20:21,520
Okay, I just wanna kill him, though.

4408
03:20:23,400 --> 03:20:23,880
Nice.

4409
03:20:25,380 --> 03:20:26,340
Get out of here.

4410
03:20:28,420 --> 03:20:30,760
You serve no purpose but to die!

4411
03:20:32,100 --> 03:20:32,960
That's right!

4412
03:20:34,740 --> 03:20:35,660
Oh, fuck!

4413
03:20:37,880 --> 03:20:40,720
Okay, now I can use...

4414
03:20:40,720 --> 03:20:41,680
I'll use this.

4415
03:20:41,980 --> 03:20:43,560
Actually, I should use...

4416
03:20:43,560 --> 03:20:44,580
I should use this.

4417
03:20:44,820 --> 03:20:46,280
Just because there are so many of them.

4418
03:20:51,000 --> 03:20:51,600
Suck.

4419
03:20:54,870 --> 03:20:55,870
Okay, nice.

4420
03:21:00,170 --> 03:21:00,810
Oh, no.

4421
03:21:00,950 --> 03:21:01,730
There's more of you?

4422
03:21:02,190 --> 03:21:02,670
Alright.

4423
03:21:03,010 --> 03:21:03,710
Get out of here.

4424
03:21:04,590 --> 03:21:05,970
I have one more.

4425
03:21:06,510 --> 03:21:07,530
I have one more.

4426
03:21:07,630 --> 03:21:07,830
Oh, wait.

4427
03:21:07,910 --> 03:21:08,310
I don't.

4428
03:21:08,710 --> 03:21:11,310
I was gonna say, I have one more in me.

4429
03:21:11,790 --> 03:21:13,090
I actually don't.

4430
03:21:13,530 --> 03:21:13,990
Here we go.

4431
03:21:14,190 --> 03:21:14,490
Poke.

4432
03:21:18,050 --> 03:21:18,530
Hello?

4433
03:21:20,230 --> 03:21:20,710
Hello?

4434
03:21:25,630 --> 03:21:26,390
Oh, okay.

4435
03:21:26,390 --> 03:21:27,450
I got a little worried.

4436
03:21:27,570 --> 03:21:29,290
I thought I got stuck here.

4437
03:21:30,990 --> 03:21:32,110
I was like, huh?

4438
03:21:33,810 --> 03:21:35,110
Alright, there we go.

4439
03:21:36,730 --> 03:21:39,450
That got a little worrisome there.

4440
03:21:40,670 --> 03:21:42,770
I thought I got stuck down there.

4441
03:21:43,050 --> 03:21:44,630
I was like, oh, that's bad.

4442
03:21:51,690 --> 03:21:52,630
Oh, my God.

4443
03:21:52,850 --> 03:21:53,050
Okay.

4444
03:21:56,430 --> 03:21:57,210
Oh, shit!

4445
03:21:57,610 --> 03:21:58,310
Oh, my God.

4446
03:21:58,410 --> 03:21:59,090
I didn't see him.

4447
03:22:02,070 --> 03:22:02,590
Actually...

4448
03:22:02,590 --> 03:22:03,070
You know what?

4449
03:22:04,070 --> 03:22:04,950
Hammer time.

4450
03:22:07,350 --> 03:22:08,290
There we go.

4451
03:22:08,450 --> 03:22:09,230
I feel like...

4452
03:22:09,230 --> 03:22:09,810
Yeah, hammers.

4453
03:22:10,590 --> 03:22:10,690
Oh.

4454
03:22:12,370 --> 03:22:13,310
That's right.

4455
03:22:13,690 --> 03:22:14,050
Whoa.

4456
03:22:16,170 --> 03:22:17,650
Oh, my God.

4457
03:22:17,850 --> 03:22:18,270
Get out!

4458
03:22:19,590 --> 03:22:20,190
Hammer!

4459
03:22:21,750 --> 03:22:22,470
Hammer!

4460
03:22:22,610 --> 03:22:22,970
Oh, shit.

4461
03:22:23,910 --> 03:22:24,830
Oh, my God.

4462
03:22:24,990 --> 03:22:25,170
Stop!

4463
03:22:26,030 --> 03:22:26,270
Stop!

4464
03:22:28,390 --> 03:22:29,110
Stop!

4465
03:22:29,110 --> 03:22:29,570
Oh, my God.

4466
03:22:29,750 --> 03:22:30,910
I said stop!

4467
03:22:32,330 --> 03:22:33,450
Okay, that's it.

4468
03:22:33,510 --> 03:22:34,010
I'm angry.

4469
03:22:34,630 --> 03:22:36,030
I'm angry now.

4470
03:22:39,370 --> 03:22:40,290
That's it.

4471
03:22:41,090 --> 03:22:43,130
You made me use wind.

4472
03:22:46,930 --> 03:22:48,710
You made me angry.

4473
03:22:52,770 --> 03:22:53,650
Oh, nice.

4474
03:22:53,870 --> 03:22:54,610
Wait, what the fuck?

4475
03:22:54,750 --> 03:22:55,530
That was so OP.

4476
03:22:56,110 --> 03:22:56,850
Holy fuck.

4477
03:22:58,250 --> 03:22:58,890
Oh, my God.

4478
03:22:58,970 --> 03:22:59,550
Oh, my God.

4479
03:22:59,770 --> 03:23:00,850
He was like, what the fuck?

4480
03:23:01,030 --> 03:23:02,390
Wait, you weren't supposed to kill him yet.

4481
03:23:07,920 --> 03:23:08,700
Oh, fuck.

4482
03:23:09,800 --> 03:23:12,220
You think Pothi's gonna save you?

4483
03:23:16,620 --> 03:23:17,560
What the fuck?

4484
03:23:17,840 --> 03:23:18,260
Oh, my God.

4485
03:23:21,820 --> 03:23:22,020
Shit!

4486
03:23:25,360 --> 03:23:26,660
He just picked me up.

4487
03:23:27,540 --> 03:23:28,480
Just like that.

4488
03:23:30,340 --> 03:23:31,720
I was like, let me go, please.

4489
03:23:34,540 --> 03:23:35,500
Get grappled.

4490
03:23:35,660 --> 03:23:38,980
I didn't think he would just pick me up like that.

4491
03:23:40,080 --> 03:23:41,400
Bro, that was scary.

4492
03:23:42,820 --> 03:23:43,820
That was scary.

4493
03:23:48,240 --> 03:23:50,960
He just like, picked me up like I was nothing.

4494
03:23:52,400 --> 03:23:53,440
Give me a sec.

4495
03:23:53,660 --> 03:23:54,320
Don't move yet.

4496
03:23:54,820 --> 03:23:55,800
Don't move yet.

4497
03:23:57,780 --> 03:23:58,620
Okay, nice.

4498
03:23:59,920 --> 03:24:03,240
I was like, can you just like, wait a little bit?

4499
03:24:04,940 --> 03:24:05,820
Oh, no.

4500
03:24:06,060 --> 03:24:07,760
I don't have any more magic.

4501
03:24:08,480 --> 03:24:11,000
Wait, I think this does one more extra.

4502
03:24:11,740 --> 03:24:12,260
No.

4503
03:24:13,380 --> 03:24:16,060
Okay, it's time to fight him legit now.

4504
03:24:16,320 --> 03:24:18,120
I have no more magic, guys.

4505
03:24:18,820 --> 03:24:20,640
I am not using my item.

4506
03:24:26,780 --> 03:24:27,680
Oh, my God.

4507
03:24:28,480 --> 03:24:29,580
I have to do it legit.

4508
03:24:30,880 --> 03:24:32,060
It felt terrible.

4509
03:24:39,740 --> 03:24:40,860
Oh, my God.

4510
03:24:41,460 --> 03:24:43,480
I have to play that legitly.

4511
03:24:44,520 --> 03:24:46,540
You legit fighting.

4512
03:24:47,440 --> 03:24:48,280
I know.

4513
03:24:49,540 --> 03:24:51,100
It felt disgusting.

4514
03:24:52,360 --> 03:24:53,780
Okay, I can spin for this.

4515
03:24:53,940 --> 03:24:54,560
I hate these guys.

4516
03:24:54,680 --> 03:24:55,300
I'm spinning for it.

4517
03:24:55,400 --> 03:24:56,620
I can't spin for it.

4518
03:24:56,820 --> 03:24:57,140
No!

4519
03:25:02,740 --> 03:25:04,420
What do you mean I can't spin?

4520
03:25:09,910 --> 03:25:10,950
What's the point?

4521
03:25:19,670 --> 03:25:20,390
Oh, my God.

4522
03:25:20,510 --> 03:25:20,890
I hate these guys.

4523
03:25:21,030 --> 03:25:21,350
I hate you.

4524
03:25:21,470 --> 03:25:22,850
I hate you so much.

4525
03:25:24,790 --> 03:25:26,510
I hate you guys so much.

4526
03:25:26,670 --> 03:25:28,310
I hate you guys so much.

4527
03:25:28,430 --> 03:25:30,210
Because I can't lock you.

4528
03:25:34,550 --> 03:25:35,030
Okay.

4529
03:25:35,350 --> 03:25:36,690
I did not expect that.

4530
03:25:36,990 --> 03:25:37,590
I take those.

4531
03:25:40,870 --> 03:25:41,350
Nice.

4532
03:25:43,650 --> 03:25:45,130
Oh, I take those.

4533
03:25:46,930 --> 03:25:47,370
Hello?

4534
03:25:48,430 --> 03:25:49,170
Oh, there you go.

4535
03:25:55,670 --> 03:25:56,710
Oh, I would spin.

4536
03:25:56,910 --> 03:25:59,390
But they're all too far away to justify it.

4537
03:26:00,250 --> 03:26:01,090
They're too far.

4538
03:26:01,310 --> 03:26:01,430
Wait.

4539
03:26:01,750 --> 03:26:02,190
Spin!

4540
03:26:05,190 --> 03:26:05,970
Oh, my God.

4541
03:26:05,970 --> 03:26:06,410
I hate you.

4542
03:26:06,710 --> 03:26:07,470
I hate you.

4543
03:26:07,930 --> 03:26:08,510
Oh, my God.

4544
03:26:08,510 --> 03:26:10,550
I wish I could kill your entire family.

4545
03:26:12,110 --> 03:26:13,550
That's how much I hate you.

4546
03:26:20,100 --> 03:26:20,960
Oh, my God.

4547
03:26:21,080 --> 03:26:21,620
I can't spin.

4548
03:26:21,760 --> 03:26:22,340
I'm so sad.

4549
03:26:23,800 --> 03:26:26,600
This is actually, like, the perfect spin, cop.

4550
03:26:33,640 --> 03:26:34,240
Okay.

4551
03:26:38,050 --> 03:26:38,650
Nice.

4552
03:26:38,970 --> 03:26:40,010
Oh, I got the spin!

4553
03:26:41,850 --> 03:26:42,450
Worth.

4554
03:26:44,350 --> 03:26:45,490
I can spin.

4555
03:26:45,490 --> 03:26:46,550
It was so worth it.

4556
03:26:50,990 --> 03:26:51,590
Alright.

4557
03:26:51,610 --> 03:26:52,330
We just wait.

4558
03:26:53,470 --> 03:26:54,510
Just gotta wait.

4559
03:26:56,130 --> 03:26:58,070
Get over here.

4560
03:27:00,690 --> 03:27:01,390
Alright.

4561
03:27:03,310 --> 03:27:04,650
Get over here!

4562
03:27:07,610 --> 03:27:08,590
That's right!

4563
03:27:10,530 --> 03:27:11,670
Stabby, stabby.

4564
03:27:14,690 --> 03:27:15,930
Stabby, stabby.

4565
03:27:17,490 --> 03:27:18,650
Oh, thank God.

4566
03:27:19,870 --> 03:27:20,570
Proceed.

4567
03:27:22,090 --> 03:27:23,030
Oh, no.

4568
03:27:23,810 --> 03:27:24,770
I think I have enough.

4569
03:27:26,250 --> 03:27:27,130
I think I have...

4570
03:27:27,130 --> 03:27:27,350
No!

4571
03:27:27,630 --> 03:27:27,870
What?

4572
03:27:28,270 --> 03:27:29,370
Are you serious?

4573
03:27:30,770 --> 03:27:32,070
No, I don't have enough!

4574
03:27:32,470 --> 03:27:32,750
No!

4575
03:27:33,130 --> 03:27:33,670
No!

4576
03:27:37,440 --> 03:27:39,860
I, in fact, did not have enough, guys.

4577
03:27:42,520 --> 03:27:43,700
Guys, please.

4578
03:27:45,680 --> 03:27:46,220
Nice.

4579
03:27:48,100 --> 03:27:48,640
Okay.

4580
03:27:51,420 --> 03:27:52,480
I can't believe...

4581
03:27:52,480 --> 03:27:54,440
I blocked it, but it didn't register there.

4582
03:27:54,440 --> 03:27:55,160
I'm so mad.

4583
03:27:55,840 --> 03:27:56,960
I'm so...

4584
03:27:56,960 --> 03:27:58,040
Oh, I'm so mad.

4585
03:27:58,260 --> 03:27:58,940
I'm so mad.

4586
03:28:01,220 --> 03:28:01,960
That's it!

4587
03:28:02,820 --> 03:28:03,900
Just for you!

4588
03:28:04,880 --> 03:28:06,920
I spin just for you!

4589
03:28:12,740 --> 03:28:13,300
Okay.

4590
03:28:16,760 --> 03:28:17,880
Oh, my God.

4591
03:28:18,040 --> 03:28:18,760
Get them out of here.

4592
03:28:19,220 --> 03:28:20,440
Get them out of here!

4593
03:28:20,840 --> 03:28:21,400
Get them out of here!

4594
03:28:23,780 --> 03:28:25,740
Oh, I have so little HP.

4595
03:28:27,660 --> 03:28:30,460
Guys, I don't even know what room I'm in anymore.

4596
03:28:30,820 --> 03:28:31,260
I...

4597
03:28:31,260 --> 03:28:32,360
I don't know.

4598
03:28:36,230 --> 03:28:37,610
I don't know.

4599
03:28:37,950 --> 03:28:39,670
I haven't been counting.

4600
03:28:43,650 --> 03:28:45,310
I'm so confused.

4601
03:28:50,390 --> 03:28:51,570
I'm so...

4602
03:28:51,570 --> 03:28:52,270
Oh, my God!

4603
03:28:59,410 --> 03:29:01,330
What number am I on?

4604
03:29:02,350 --> 03:29:02,950
Five...

4605
03:29:02,950 --> 03:29:03,730
5.3.

4606
03:29:05,430 --> 03:29:07,630
Okay, I might need a heal.

4607
03:29:08,050 --> 03:29:09,710
Like, this looks like a...

4608
03:29:09,710 --> 03:29:12,290
This looks like a healing situation.

4609
03:29:12,630 --> 03:29:13,230
Like...

4610
03:29:13,830 --> 03:29:16,350
I think I have to be desperate here.

4611
03:29:16,350 --> 03:29:17,450
Oh!

4612
03:29:17,750 --> 03:29:18,010
Oh!

4613
03:29:18,470 --> 03:29:18,590
Oh!

4614
03:29:18,690 --> 03:29:19,450
Okay.

4615
03:29:19,570 --> 03:29:20,810
I'm glad I healed.

4616
03:29:21,390 --> 03:29:21,710
I'm...

4617
03:29:21,710 --> 03:29:23,010
I'm glad...

4618
03:29:23,010 --> 03:29:24,190
I'm glad I...

4619
03:29:24,190 --> 03:29:26,030
I swear...

4620
03:29:26,030 --> 03:29:26,710
to God.

4621
03:29:27,250 --> 03:29:29,890
Of course it locks onto him.

4622
03:29:30,350 --> 03:29:32,410
Of fucking course it locks onto the lizard.

4623
03:29:32,730 --> 03:29:34,190
Of fucking course.

4624
03:29:40,030 --> 03:29:42,050
Of fucking course.

4625
03:29:42,430 --> 03:29:45,390
It locks to the one I didn't want to lock.

4626
03:30:05,060 --> 03:30:05,620
Okay.

4627
03:30:09,470 --> 03:30:10,570
I'm so scared.

4628
03:30:11,150 --> 03:30:12,310
I'm so scared.

4629
03:30:12,490 --> 03:30:13,230
I'm so scared.

4630
03:30:14,150 --> 03:30:15,450
I'm so scared.

4631
03:30:16,690 --> 03:30:18,090
No, I can live this.

4632
03:30:20,610 --> 03:30:21,170
Okay.

4633
03:30:22,630 --> 03:30:24,330
I can still live this, guys.

4634
03:30:29,050 --> 03:30:29,610
Okay.

4635
03:30:29,890 --> 03:30:31,630
I don't think I can live this anymore.

4636
03:30:31,630 --> 03:30:32,310
I...

4637
03:30:32,310 --> 03:30:35,190
I don't think I can live this anymore.

4638
03:30:35,850 --> 03:30:36,350
I...

4639
03:30:37,590 --> 03:30:39,930
This was the moment I realized.

4640
03:30:40,350 --> 03:30:42,130
Maybe I don't live this.

4641
03:30:43,990 --> 03:30:44,810
Okay.

4642
03:30:47,090 --> 03:30:47,670
All right.

4643
03:30:47,810 --> 03:30:48,350
We did it.

4644
03:30:48,830 --> 03:30:50,390
We did it.

4645
03:30:53,390 --> 03:30:55,910
I got a little worry there, guys.

4646
03:30:56,350 --> 03:30:58,050
That I might not live it.

4647
03:31:01,130 --> 03:31:02,510
Just a little bit.

4648
03:31:02,850 --> 03:31:04,810
It was only a little scary.

4649
03:31:10,440 --> 03:31:11,120
All right.

4650
03:31:11,380 --> 03:31:11,520
Nice.

4651
03:31:15,360 --> 03:31:16,500
We made it, though.

4652
03:31:21,600 --> 03:31:22,400
Oh my god.

4653
03:31:22,560 --> 03:31:24,220
These rooms feel like forever.

4654
03:31:24,580 --> 03:31:28,060
I feel like I've been trapped in purgatory for so long.

4655
03:31:28,500 --> 03:31:30,340
All for the stupid...

4656
03:31:30,340 --> 03:31:30,980
...flame.

4657
03:31:31,100 --> 03:31:32,760
Because the knife had fire.

4658
03:31:34,840 --> 03:31:37,800
Doki, you don't understand, Doki.

4659
03:31:38,320 --> 03:31:41,080
It's a flaming knife, Doki.

4660
03:31:41,240 --> 03:31:42,300
You don't understand.

4661
03:31:42,300 --> 03:31:43,460
It would be so cool.

4662
03:31:48,480 --> 03:31:48,860
Yeah.

4663
03:31:49,240 --> 03:31:50,140
But fire.

4664
03:31:50,420 --> 03:31:51,180
Good, Doki.

4665
03:32:03,620 --> 03:32:04,260
All right.

4666
03:32:07,860 --> 03:32:08,340
Okay.

4667
03:32:08,860 --> 03:32:10,600
Let's make sure I grab all of this.

4668
03:32:12,740 --> 03:32:13,960
Oh my god.

4669
03:32:14,980 --> 03:32:15,460
There's...

4670
03:32:16,300 --> 03:32:16,780
Okay.

4671
03:32:16,920 --> 03:32:18,720
I want to be sure, like, what I'm...

4672
03:32:19,840 --> 03:32:20,320
Okay.

4673
03:32:23,790 --> 03:32:24,670
Get out of here!

4674
03:32:28,070 --> 03:32:28,550
Okay.

4675
03:32:29,410 --> 03:32:30,850
Oh, hammer time!

4676
03:32:34,300 --> 03:32:35,260
There we go.

4677
03:32:36,920 --> 03:32:37,960
There's more!

4678
03:32:38,120 --> 03:32:38,620
That's it!

4679
03:32:41,200 --> 03:32:42,060
That's it!

4680
03:32:42,740 --> 03:32:43,720
I'm done!

4681
03:32:44,040 --> 03:32:45,460
You don't get magic!

4682
03:32:46,020 --> 03:32:47,020
I'm tired!

4683
03:32:53,800 --> 03:32:55,260
Yeah, I had enough.

4684
03:32:55,600 --> 03:32:56,700
I had enough.

4685
03:32:57,920 --> 03:32:59,460
No magic for you!

4686
03:33:01,260 --> 03:33:02,240
Oh, shit.

4687
03:33:02,240 --> 03:33:02,580
Okay.

4688
03:33:03,480 --> 03:33:05,060
Maybe I should give him magic.

4689
03:33:06,780 --> 03:33:07,300
Okay.

4690
03:33:07,360 --> 03:33:07,780
That's it.

4691
03:33:08,820 --> 03:33:09,400
That's it.

4692
03:33:09,500 --> 03:33:10,060
That's too many.

4693
03:33:10,280 --> 03:33:10,980
Too many.

4694
03:33:11,260 --> 03:33:12,080
Too many.

4695
03:33:12,500 --> 03:33:13,680
Now you get magic.

4696
03:33:14,900 --> 03:33:17,200
There's just too many things going on on my screen.

4697
03:33:19,980 --> 03:33:20,780
Oh, why?

4698
03:33:21,080 --> 03:33:21,620
Yeah, I know.

4699
03:33:21,760 --> 03:33:22,880
I was like, wait a minute.

4700
03:33:23,220 --> 03:33:23,720
All right.

4701
03:33:23,880 --> 03:33:24,420
I'm done.

4702
03:33:24,880 --> 03:33:26,360
I was like, that's...

4703
03:33:26,360 --> 03:33:26,840
That's it.

4704
03:33:27,440 --> 03:33:28,540
You've had your fun.

4705
03:33:30,380 --> 03:33:32,140
You've had your fun.

4706
03:33:32,280 --> 03:33:33,200
You've had your fun.

4707
03:33:33,200 --> 03:33:33,580
I'm done.

4708
03:33:35,620 --> 03:33:37,380
I'm done.

4709
03:33:38,970 --> 03:33:39,890
Okay.

4710
03:33:44,700 --> 03:33:46,780
Are you fucking giving me?

4711
03:33:51,170 --> 03:33:51,950
Get out of here.

4712
03:33:52,830 --> 03:33:53,590
Oh

4713
03:33:57,450 --> 03:33:57,890
my god!

4714
03:33:58,050 --> 03:33:58,310
Stop!

4715
03:33:58,790 --> 03:33:58,990
Stop!

4716
03:34:00,310 --> 03:34:01,070
Stop!

4717
03:34:01,830 --> 03:34:02,130
Stop!

4718
03:34:03,230 --> 03:34:03,990
Stop!

4719
03:34:04,710 --> 03:34:05,470
Stop!

4720
03:34:06,970 --> 03:34:07,730
Stop!

4721
03:34:08,010 --> 03:34:08,390
Stop!

4722
03:34:08,770 --> 03:34:09,210
Stop!

4723
03:34:09,210 --> 03:34:09,330
Stop!

4724
03:34:09,610 --> 03:34:10,490
I will flatten you.

4725
03:34:13,210 --> 03:34:13,970
Stop.

4726
03:34:14,250 --> 03:34:14,650
I'm done.

4727
03:34:15,530 --> 03:34:16,410
Stop this.

4728
03:34:17,110 --> 03:34:18,090
Stop this!

4729
03:34:18,690 --> 03:34:19,450
Stop!

4730
03:34:22,830 --> 03:34:24,690
I'm not playing anymore.

4731
03:34:26,250 --> 03:34:27,490
Get out of here.

4732
03:34:29,830 --> 03:34:30,870
Get out!

4733
03:34:31,110 --> 03:34:32,550
I shall flatten you.

4734
03:34:34,070 --> 03:34:35,890
Not fucking around anymore.

4735
03:34:38,570 --> 03:34:39,570
Just stop.

4736
03:34:39,930 --> 03:34:40,390
No.

4737
03:34:41,910 --> 03:34:43,690
I was gonna say... Oh no.

4738
03:34:44,790 --> 03:34:46,830
Okay, I still have... I still have magic.

4739
03:34:49,150 --> 03:34:49,810
What?

4740
03:34:51,210 --> 03:34:51,870
Okay.

4741
03:34:53,170 --> 03:34:55,090
Okay, I was gonna swear.

4742
03:34:55,170 --> 03:34:55,730
I swear to God.

4743
03:34:55,730 --> 03:35:00,410
I was gonna... I was gonna be more angry.

4744
03:35:05,970 --> 03:35:07,410
Oh my god.

4745
03:35:07,670 --> 03:35:07,810
Okay.

4746
03:35:19,220 --> 03:35:25,370
Okay, these guys... I swear to God.

4747
03:35:25,610 --> 03:35:27,830
Your existence doesn't matter!

4748
03:35:36,270 --> 03:35:37,710
Yeah, the hammer's strong.

4749
03:35:38,010 --> 03:35:40,730
But, like, the lead-up time for it is, like, too much.

4750
03:35:44,440 --> 03:35:45,240
Oh my god.

4751
03:35:45,580 --> 03:35:46,300
Why are you defending?

4752
03:35:46,540 --> 03:35:47,480
Why are you blocking?

4753
03:35:48,680 --> 03:35:50,860
I am... I'm not dying to these guys.

4754
03:35:51,060 --> 03:35:53,520
I... I... I'm not dying to them.

4755
03:35:54,060 --> 03:35:55,260
I'm not...

4756
03:35:57,240 --> 03:35:59,500
I'm not dying to these fuckers.

4757
03:36:05,590 --> 03:36:06,270
I'm not dying to these fuckers.

4758
03:36:06,270 --> 03:36:06,270
Okay.

4759
03:36:08,590 --> 03:36:09,630
Get out of here.

4760
03:36:14,520 --> 03:36:15,680
All right, here we go.

4761
03:36:16,700 --> 03:36:17,680
Another room.

4762
03:36:18,800 --> 03:36:19,960
Oh no, not that.

4763
03:36:22,640 --> 03:36:23,480
Oh no.

4764
03:36:24,120 --> 03:36:24,820
Okay, it's fine.

4765
03:36:24,920 --> 03:36:25,360
I have hammer.

4766
03:36:26,220 --> 03:36:27,140
Not these guys.

4767
03:36:27,140 --> 03:36:28,820
Oh my god.

4768
03:36:34,350 --> 03:36:35,030
Okay.

4769
03:36:35,830 --> 03:36:36,670
That's fine.

4770
03:36:42,830 --> 03:36:45,110
Got a little worried about the...

4771
03:36:45,110 --> 03:36:45,710
Oh fuck!

4772
03:36:46,230 --> 03:36:47,610
I forgot they explode!

4773
03:36:47,930 --> 03:36:48,950
Oh shit!

4774
03:36:49,510 --> 03:36:51,150
Okay, that was my bad.

4775
03:36:52,070 --> 03:36:54,630
I forgot about the explosions.

4776
03:36:57,290 --> 03:36:59,050
That was my bad.

4777
03:37:05,750 --> 03:37:06,430
Okay.

4778
03:37:06,650 --> 03:37:07,750
I'm not getting close to that.

4779
03:37:07,870 --> 03:37:08,330
I'm not.

4780
03:37:08,330 --> 03:37:09,250
I learned my lesson.

4781
03:37:09,490 --> 03:37:10,630
I learned my lesson.

4782
03:37:20,460 --> 03:37:21,160
Oh wait.

4783
03:37:22,260 --> 03:37:23,180
Oh, it's these guys.

4784
03:37:27,180 --> 03:37:28,060
Okay, nice.

4785
03:37:31,020 --> 03:37:31,800
Oh my god.

4786
03:37:31,980 --> 03:37:32,640
Okay, not nice.

4787
03:37:38,620 --> 03:37:39,440
All right, nice.

4788
03:37:41,440 --> 03:37:42,660
Oh god, please don't hit me.

4789
03:37:42,960 --> 03:37:44,220
Please don't hit me while I do this.

4790
03:37:44,400 --> 03:37:45,200
Please don't hit me!

4791
03:37:46,600 --> 03:37:47,040
Nice!

4792
03:37:47,280 --> 03:37:48,780
Oh, they got the perfect pairing.

4793
03:37:49,320 --> 03:37:50,460
The perfect counter.

4794
03:37:51,480 --> 03:37:52,480
I got scared.

4795
03:37:58,630 --> 03:37:59,230
Oh!

4796
03:37:59,230 --> 03:38:00,910
They got lucky there.

4797
03:38:06,560 --> 03:38:07,160
Okay.

4798
03:38:08,400 --> 03:38:09,000
Nice.

4799
03:38:11,100 --> 03:38:11,700
Oh!

4800
03:38:12,900 --> 03:38:14,740
Got the crit when it matted!

4801
03:38:17,380 --> 03:38:19,900
I don't need the... I don't need the demon orb.

4802
03:38:20,140 --> 03:38:21,420
I should be fine without it.

4803
03:38:23,820 --> 03:38:24,640
Yes.

4804
03:38:25,640 --> 03:38:26,680
Oh, him.

4805
03:38:27,740 --> 03:38:29,720
Okay, I have more sword.

4806
03:38:32,320 --> 03:38:33,380
Oh fuck!

4807
03:38:36,560 --> 03:38:38,540
I got camera'd again.

4808
03:38:38,720 --> 03:38:40,400
I always get camera'd!

4809
03:38:40,500 --> 03:38:41,740
It's not fair!

4810
03:38:51,050 --> 03:38:53,050
It's always a god damn!

4811
03:38:56,160 --> 03:38:57,520
Are you serious?

4812
03:38:59,300 --> 03:39:00,180
That's it.

4813
03:39:00,500 --> 03:39:01,380
Get over here.

4814
03:39:02,380 --> 03:39:03,840
I'm not fucking with you.

4815
03:39:04,660 --> 03:39:06,100
I can't.

4816
03:39:09,860 --> 03:39:12,120
You made me use too many heals.

4817
03:39:14,280 --> 03:39:16,980
I need these heals for the boss.

4818
03:39:17,220 --> 03:39:18,420
Not for this!

4819
03:39:23,880 --> 03:39:25,080
I'm a little scared.

4820
03:39:25,200 --> 03:39:26,260
He was very close to me.

4821
03:39:27,400 --> 03:39:28,200
There we go.

4822
03:39:33,590 --> 03:39:33,750
Okay.

4823
03:39:37,600 --> 03:39:38,040
Okay.

4824
03:39:38,060 --> 03:39:38,800
All right.

4825
03:39:40,120 --> 03:39:40,900
Oh god.

4826
03:39:42,840 --> 03:39:43,940
Listen, Doki.

4827
03:39:44,200 --> 03:39:45,300
You don't understand.

4828
03:39:45,300 --> 03:39:46,420
It's on fire!

4829
03:39:50,720 --> 03:39:51,300
Toki.

4830
03:39:51,760 --> 03:39:53,840
It's on fire, Toki.

4831
03:39:54,140 --> 03:39:55,080
You don't understand.

4832
03:39:55,420 --> 03:39:58,700
It'd be so... It's gonna be so worth it.

4833
03:39:59,000 --> 03:40:00,400
Guys, is this the last level?

4834
03:40:00,580 --> 03:40:02,920
I need to know before I do anything.

4835
03:40:03,640 --> 03:40:05,560
Is this... I lost count.

4836
03:40:05,920 --> 03:40:08,100
Everything has actually... It's been a blur.

4837
03:40:10,040 --> 03:40:12,520
It's... It's really cool, Toki.

4838
03:40:12,780 --> 03:40:13,760
You don't understand.

4839
03:40:17,880 --> 03:40:19,820
Guys, I think I understand.

4840
03:40:22,300 --> 03:40:24,200
I don't know.

4841
03:40:24,380 --> 03:40:26,060
I don't know either!

4842
03:40:26,320 --> 03:40:27,480
I lost count!

4843
03:40:30,380 --> 03:40:32,200
I don't... I don't know too!

4844
03:40:37,770 --> 03:40:40,070
Oh no, I used all my magic.

4845
03:40:41,950 --> 03:40:42,890
Oh no.

4846
03:40:44,750 --> 03:40:45,310
JK!

4847
03:40:51,810 --> 03:40:52,430
Okay.

4848
03:41:00,070 --> 03:41:01,350
I just need this.

4849
03:41:01,610 --> 03:41:03,650
Before he gets closer, I just need this.

4850
03:41:07,110 --> 03:41:09,850
I don't think I have enough magic for this.

4851
03:41:10,490 --> 03:41:12,010
Oh no, I don't.

4852
03:41:13,050 --> 03:41:13,750
Guys!

4853
03:41:14,010 --> 03:41:14,890
Oh my god!

4854
03:41:18,710 --> 03:41:20,170
Oh my medicine!

4855
03:41:25,320 --> 03:41:26,170
Oh fuck!

4856
03:41:31,370 --> 03:41:32,290
It's okay.

4857
03:41:32,770 --> 03:41:34,090
I got this!

4858
03:41:36,320 --> 03:41:37,070
Jesus Christ.

4859
03:41:42,020 --> 03:41:43,620
Oh my god, not you.

4860
03:41:53,240 --> 03:41:54,120
Oh my god!

4861
03:41:56,740 --> 03:41:57,200
Oh my god!

4862
03:41:57,260 --> 03:41:57,980
I actually needed that!

4863
03:41:58,160 --> 03:41:58,840
Holy fuck!

4864
03:41:59,040 --> 03:42:00,380
I needed that so badly!

4865
03:42:01,220 --> 03:42:01,800
Oh my god!

4866
03:42:01,800 --> 03:42:02,460
I don't know how I did it!

4867
03:42:02,740 --> 03:42:03,920
I don't know how I did it!

4868
03:42:04,800 --> 03:42:05,420
Oh fuck!

4869
03:42:05,460 --> 03:42:06,280
I don't know how I did that!

4870
03:42:06,720 --> 03:42:08,120
I actually don't know how I did that!

4871
03:42:09,420 --> 03:42:11,420
It's like a fucking god came over!

4872
03:42:12,740 --> 03:42:13,180
Oh my god!

4873
03:42:13,620 --> 03:42:14,560
Please, I need that magic!

4874
03:42:14,780 --> 03:42:16,520
I need that magic so badly!

4875
03:42:22,290 --> 03:42:22,650
Oh!

4876
03:42:25,190 --> 03:42:27,370
No, the magic despawned!

4877
03:42:35,040 --> 03:42:36,300
I'm so sad.

4878
03:42:36,540 --> 03:42:38,200
The magic despawned, guys.

4879
03:42:38,560 --> 03:42:40,940
The magic despawned!

4880
03:42:48,140 --> 03:42:48,780
Guys!

4881
03:42:50,640 --> 03:42:54,000
Oh my god, I don't have enough... I...

4882
03:42:54,680 --> 03:42:55,800
Oh my god.

4883
03:42:58,220 --> 03:42:59,520
Oh my god!

4884
03:42:59,700 --> 03:43:01,200
This is not looking good.

4885
03:43:01,760 --> 03:43:02,840
I might have...

4886
03:43:03,400 --> 03:43:05,400
That is not looking good, guys.

4887
03:43:06,680 --> 03:43:09,160
It's not looking good for Doki right now.

4888
03:43:14,170 --> 03:43:15,230
Oh my god.

4889
03:43:19,430 --> 03:43:23,250
I don't know how... I wish I knew how I do these crits, guys.

4890
03:43:28,450 --> 03:43:30,950
I wish I know how I'm doing them.

4891
03:43:33,190 --> 03:43:34,510
Oh my god, though.

4892
03:43:34,850 --> 03:43:35,870
There's more.

4893
03:43:36,250 --> 03:43:39,170
I don't have any magic left.

4894
03:43:39,950 --> 03:43:41,530
Oh my god.

4895
03:43:44,440 --> 03:43:46,220
This is not good.

4896
03:43:51,630 --> 03:43:52,390
No!

4897
03:43:53,070 --> 03:43:53,830
No!

4898
03:43:54,590 --> 03:43:55,530
Oh no!

4899
03:43:56,350 --> 03:43:56,470
Oh no!

4900
03:44:00,160 --> 03:44:01,740
I don't have gun!

4901
03:44:02,180 --> 03:44:03,220
There's no bullets!

4902
03:44:07,780 --> 03:44:08,940
There's no bullets.

4903
03:44:09,400 --> 03:44:11,020
There's no bullets in my gun.

4904
03:44:11,020 --> 03:44:13,420
There's no bullets in my gun, guys.

4905
03:44:14,540 --> 03:44:16,260
Oh my god!

4906
03:44:22,230 --> 03:44:22,990
No!

4907
03:44:25,490 --> 03:44:25,870
No!

4908
03:44:26,710 --> 03:44:27,490
I got it!

4909
03:44:27,870 --> 03:44:28,810
I can't!

4910
03:44:29,930 --> 03:44:30,690
I can't!

4911
03:44:32,030 --> 03:44:33,130
I had to!

4912
03:44:34,030 --> 03:44:35,130
I had to!

4913
03:44:35,390 --> 03:44:35,830
I had to!

4914
03:44:35,830 --> 03:44:37,710
It was the only way to live!

4915
03:44:37,930 --> 03:44:39,630
It was the only way!

4916
03:44:39,970 --> 03:44:41,010
You don't understand?

4917
03:44:46,750 --> 03:44:49,150
I will die if I didn't do it.

4918
03:44:51,070 --> 03:44:52,070
Oh my god!

4919
03:44:52,130 --> 03:44:53,010
Oh my god!

4920
03:44:53,110 --> 03:44:54,550
I see my life flash by!

4921
03:44:57,830 --> 03:45:00,790
I see my life flash before I be right there.

4922
03:45:01,250 --> 03:45:02,530
Oh my god!

4923
03:45:03,650 --> 03:45:04,770
Oh my god!

4924
03:45:04,930 --> 03:45:05,770
What do I do?

4925
03:45:05,910 --> 03:45:06,870
I'm fucking...

4926
03:45:06,870 --> 03:45:07,730
Oh my god!

4927
03:45:07,870 --> 03:45:08,890
It locked me in!

4928
03:45:13,150 --> 03:45:13,830
Guys!

4929
03:45:14,090 --> 03:45:18,630
I'm not even fighting the fucking boss that I'm using all my vids!

4930
03:45:19,050 --> 03:45:20,770
I'm so sad!

4931
03:45:20,770 --> 03:45:23,690
I'm not actually since then!

4932
03:45:31,050 --> 03:45:31,870
Oh my god!

4933
03:45:32,130 --> 03:45:33,230
Where am I?

4934
03:45:33,370 --> 03:45:33,830
No!

4935
03:45:34,190 --> 03:45:34,950
Get me out!

4936
03:45:36,050 --> 03:45:36,570
No!

4937
03:45:44,760 --> 03:45:45,820
Here it is!

4938
03:45:46,280 --> 03:45:48,660
You guys could have told me I was level 20!

4939
03:45:55,850 --> 03:45:57,830
I swear to god...

4940
03:45:57,830 --> 03:45:58,550
Chat...

4941
03:45:58,550 --> 03:45:59,690
This sword...

4942
03:45:59,690 --> 03:46:01,650
Better be fucking worth it!

4943
03:46:01,790 --> 03:46:03,570
I swear to fucking god!

4944
03:46:03,970 --> 03:46:04,730
I...

4945
03:46:04,730 --> 03:46:07,610
Used up all my vids for this!

4946
03:46:07,790 --> 03:46:09,070
I swear to god!

4947
03:46:11,490 --> 03:46:13,050
Doki, you never asked!

4948
03:46:17,710 --> 03:46:19,670
Okay, maybe I should use the sword here?

4949
03:46:20,130 --> 03:46:21,210
Do I do it?

4950
03:46:22,110 --> 03:46:23,910
Do I use the sword here, chat?

4951
03:46:26,970 --> 03:46:28,430
Of course, it's worth it!

4952
03:46:28,510 --> 03:46:30,030
Look how cool it is!

4953
03:46:30,350 --> 03:46:32,390
Can I use the bathroom then I'll be right back?

4954
03:47:23,300 --> 03:47:24,320
All right, I'm back!

4955
03:47:24,840 --> 03:47:25,640
Power pose!

4956
03:47:25,920 --> 03:47:26,180
Solid!

4957
03:47:26,920 --> 03:47:27,400
Menlaire!

4958
03:47:27,640 --> 03:47:28,240
Bite size!

4959
03:47:28,580 --> 03:47:29,760
Alan, thank you for the super chat!

4960
03:47:29,860 --> 03:47:30,060
Thank you!

4961
03:47:30,200 --> 03:47:30,700
Thank you!

4962
03:47:31,540 --> 03:47:32,120
All right!

4963
03:47:32,940 --> 03:47:33,980
I'm using the sword!

4964
03:47:38,520 --> 03:47:39,580
I swear to god!

4965
03:47:40,180 --> 03:47:41,920
I swear to fucking god!

4966
03:47:42,720 --> 03:47:44,280
Where does this take me?

4967
03:47:45,360 --> 03:47:46,620
I swear to god!

4968
03:47:46,880 --> 03:47:49,440
If I'm gonna go to super hell, I...

4969
03:47:49,440 --> 03:47:50,240
I swear to god!

4970
03:47:50,240 --> 03:47:50,760
No way!

4971
03:47:51,100 --> 03:47:51,700
Don't!

4972
03:47:54,420 --> 03:47:55,620
I swear...

4973
03:47:55,620 --> 03:47:58,600
I feel like one of you is lying!

4974
03:47:58,600 --> 03:47:59,400
I...

4975
03:48:00,000 --> 03:48:00,140
I...

4976
03:48:00,140 --> 03:48:00,580
I...

4977
03:48:00,900 --> 03:48:01,780
I...

4978
03:48:01,780 --> 03:48:02,580
I...

4979
03:48:02,960 --> 03:48:05,260
Why did one guy say...

4980
03:48:05,260 --> 03:48:06,380
No way!

4981
03:48:06,800 --> 03:48:07,400
Don't!

4982
03:48:07,600 --> 03:48:08,040
Why?

4983
03:48:14,740 --> 03:48:15,620
I...

4984
03:48:15,620 --> 03:48:16,500
I...

4985
03:48:16,500 --> 03:48:17,460
I...

4986
03:48:17,460 --> 03:48:17,520
I...

4987
03:48:17,520 --> 03:48:18,880
I...

4988
03:48:20,620 --> 03:48:21,500
I...

4989
03:48:21,500 --> 03:48:22,780
You'll be fine!

4990
03:48:23,260 --> 03:48:26,540
I swear, this takes you to super hell, I...

4991
03:48:27,960 --> 03:48:29,460
There's so much.

4992
03:48:29,560 --> 03:48:31,080
Alright, let's go.

4993
03:48:31,660 --> 03:48:32,460
Let's go.

4994
03:48:32,680 --> 03:48:33,380
Let's see all.

4995
03:48:33,600 --> 03:48:34,480
Oh, thank God.

4996
03:48:35,480 --> 03:48:35,760
Okay.

4997
03:48:36,960 --> 03:48:37,560
Thank God.

4998
03:48:38,760 --> 03:48:40,640
Fashionable goods, too.

4999
03:48:41,240 --> 03:48:43,180
Wow, look at all those medicine.

5000
03:48:43,920 --> 03:48:46,720
I got so much medicine.

5001
03:48:51,660 --> 03:48:53,180
Oh, my God.

5002
03:48:53,380 --> 03:48:53,680
Alright.

5003
03:48:54,280 --> 03:48:55,000
Go back.

5004
03:48:55,380 --> 03:48:57,380
Super hell-ass fashion.

5005
03:48:58,300 --> 03:48:58,940
Nice.

5006
03:48:59,820 --> 03:49:00,740
What is it?

5007
03:49:00,880 --> 03:49:01,640
What is it, Dad?

5008
03:49:02,660 --> 03:49:03,100
Come on.

5009
03:49:04,060 --> 03:49:04,660
I'm dreaming.

5010
03:49:07,820 --> 03:49:09,380
Oh, my God.

5011
03:49:09,640 --> 03:49:11,140
All my fucking items.

5012
03:49:12,100 --> 03:49:12,720
Oh, my.

5013
03:49:13,220 --> 03:49:14,660
All my items.

5014
03:49:14,960 --> 03:49:15,360
God.

5015
03:49:22,390 --> 03:49:24,670
Just like that.

5016
03:49:25,950 --> 03:49:28,510
Fucking super hell to have.

5017
03:49:32,360 --> 03:49:33,260
Alright.

5018
03:49:33,500 --> 03:49:34,000
Enhance.

5019
03:49:36,580 --> 03:49:37,480
Alright.

5020
03:49:37,600 --> 03:49:39,640
Might as well enhance the fucking hammer.

5021
03:49:43,300 --> 03:49:44,200
Nice.

5022
03:49:44,200 --> 03:49:44,440
Nice.

5023
03:49:48,460 --> 03:49:48,980
Alright.

5024
03:49:49,300 --> 03:49:52,020
I don't think I can make... I can level up my armor yet.

5025
03:49:52,280 --> 03:49:53,880
But, like...

5026
03:49:53,880 --> 03:49:56,980
It's just... I think we'll just... Oh, we did it!

5027
03:49:57,060 --> 03:49:57,740
Level 2!

5028
03:49:57,960 --> 03:49:58,760
Let's go!

5029
03:50:00,560 --> 03:50:01,080
Nice.

5030
03:50:01,600 --> 03:50:03,000
Level 2 armor.

5031
03:50:03,620 --> 03:50:04,640
There we go.

5032
03:50:05,580 --> 03:50:08,300
At least we got one level up on the armor.

5033
03:50:08,460 --> 03:50:10,240
Just one plus one defense.

5034
03:50:10,240 --> 03:50:12,300
It's the small things.

5035
03:50:12,440 --> 03:50:12,860
It's the small things in life.

5036
03:50:14,620 --> 03:50:15,420
Is it here?

5037
03:50:17,020 --> 03:50:17,680
Where?

5038
03:50:18,100 --> 03:50:19,120
What's here?

5039
03:50:19,880 --> 03:50:20,860
Oh, okay.

5040
03:50:21,000 --> 03:50:22,260
It's for the last orb.

5041
03:50:22,420 --> 03:50:22,560
Okay.

5042
03:50:24,180 --> 03:50:24,920
Alright.

5043
03:50:31,090 --> 03:50:31,530
No!

5044
03:50:31,970 --> 03:50:33,790
How are you alive?

5045
03:50:34,730 --> 03:50:35,610
No!

5046
03:50:36,270 --> 03:50:38,050
No, not you!

5047
03:50:39,030 --> 03:50:39,470
No!

5048
03:50:39,470 --> 03:50:39,910
Oh, no!

5049
03:50:41,630 --> 03:50:42,350
Hehehehe.

5050
03:50:42,350 --> 03:50:43,670
I was immortal.

5051
03:50:44,530 --> 03:50:45,930
This is going to be alive.

5052
03:50:46,150 --> 03:50:46,870
Hehehehehe.

5053
03:50:47,030 --> 03:50:47,390
No!

5054
03:50:48,130 --> 03:50:50,290
How are you still alive?

5055
03:50:57,220 --> 03:50:58,080
What the fuck?

5056
03:51:00,840 --> 03:51:01,200
Okay.

5057
03:51:03,520 --> 03:51:04,240
Alright.

5058
03:51:09,160 --> 03:51:09,740
There you go.

5059
03:51:11,060 --> 03:51:11,820
Oh, my God!

5060
03:51:11,940 --> 03:51:12,360
What the fuck?

5061
03:51:12,400 --> 03:51:13,060
I just saw him!

5062
03:51:13,060 --> 03:51:13,680
Come on.

5063
03:51:14,460 --> 03:51:15,380
Where is this?

5064
03:51:15,540 --> 03:51:16,340
What the fuck?

5065
03:51:28,570 --> 03:51:28,970
Give me a sec.

5066
03:51:29,950 --> 03:51:30,870
Give me a sec.

5067
03:51:31,210 --> 03:51:31,370
What?

5068
03:51:33,270 --> 03:51:34,470
Where is he?

5069
03:51:38,790 --> 03:51:40,090
I can't see.

5070
03:51:40,270 --> 03:51:40,430
Woo!

5071
03:51:44,820 --> 03:51:46,760
I was like, where did he go?

5072
03:51:51,000 --> 03:51:51,560
Alright.

5073
03:51:52,020 --> 03:51:53,240
Oh my god.

5074
03:51:54,300 --> 03:51:55,100
That's fine.

5075
03:51:56,400 --> 03:51:57,240
That's fine.

5076
03:51:57,500 --> 03:51:59,180
I should have enough fire again.

5077
03:51:59,880 --> 03:52:01,940
Oh, I can't kill the legs?

5078
03:52:02,120 --> 03:52:03,060
Wait, what?

5079
03:52:05,560 --> 03:52:06,800
Oh my god.

5080
03:52:06,960 --> 03:52:08,220
I can't kill the legs.

5081
03:52:08,520 --> 03:52:09,460
I can't.

5082
03:52:09,740 --> 03:52:12,440
But my thing is always on the legs!

5083
03:52:17,140 --> 03:52:17,760
Okay.

5084
03:52:21,020 --> 03:52:23,200
How the fuck was I supposed to know?

5085
03:52:23,420 --> 03:52:24,000
Legs do nothing!

5086
03:52:25,100 --> 03:52:26,060
Hee hee hee.

5087
03:52:29,200 --> 03:52:30,400
Hee hee hee.

5088
03:52:32,520 --> 03:52:33,640
Hee hee hee.

5089
03:52:33,640 --> 03:52:33,780
Hee hee hee.

5090
03:52:34,920 --> 03:52:39,100
Hee hee hee hee.

5091
03:52:39,100 --> 03:52:41,500
Hee hee hee.

5092
03:52:44,160 --> 03:52:44,940
Wait.

5093
03:52:45,300 --> 03:52:46,440
Do I have enough for fire again?

5094
03:52:46,780 --> 03:52:47,700
Yes, I do.

5095
03:52:50,800 --> 03:52:51,580
Fire!

5096
03:52:53,340 --> 03:52:54,120
Fire!

5097
03:52:54,300 --> 03:52:54,600
Yes!

5098
03:52:55,800 --> 03:52:56,820
That's right!

5099
03:52:58,560 --> 03:52:59,620
Kill him!

5100
03:53:03,100 --> 03:53:03,880
Yes!

5101
03:53:04,340 --> 03:53:06,300
You hit your last half!

5102
03:53:07,700 --> 03:53:09,160
Get out of here!

5103
03:53:09,640 --> 03:53:12,340
No more hee hee hee hee hee!

5104
03:53:12,340 --> 03:53:12,620
Huh.

5105
03:53:13,340 --> 03:53:14,560
Try to come back from that.

5106
03:53:14,860 --> 03:53:16,240
That's fucking right.

5107
03:53:18,700 --> 03:53:20,580
You hit your last half!

5108
03:53:21,800 --> 03:53:23,400
Hee hee hee.

5109
03:53:23,400 --> 03:53:25,480
Hee hee hee fucking hee.

5110
03:53:26,560 --> 03:53:28,720
Where the fuck is this goddamn hammer?

5111
03:53:28,820 --> 03:53:29,560
I'm so lost.

5112
03:53:32,840 --> 03:53:33,740
Alright, nice.

5113
03:53:35,460 --> 03:53:36,560
Where is this hammer?

5114
03:53:37,020 --> 03:53:37,920
What the fuck?

5115
03:53:39,940 --> 03:53:41,840
Okay, these cameras...

5116
03:53:42,360 --> 03:53:42,840
Fucking...

5117
03:53:42,840 --> 03:53:44,120
Wait, I already took it?

5118
03:53:44,280 --> 03:53:45,380
Oh, I already took it!

5119
03:53:45,500 --> 03:53:46,660
Okay, how do I get out of here?

5120
03:53:47,680 --> 03:53:48,820
Heh, finally!

5121
03:53:48,840 --> 03:53:50,700
He's dead, right, Toki?

5122
03:53:51,160 --> 03:53:53,120
Heh, he's dead this time, right?

5123
03:53:54,260 --> 03:53:55,880
Where the fuck is that door?

5124
03:53:55,940 --> 03:53:56,660
Is that the door?

5125
03:53:57,460 --> 03:53:58,680
Okay, the ladder.

5126
03:53:58,820 --> 03:53:59,180
There you go.

5127
03:54:02,860 --> 03:54:04,320
Okay, I should be able to enhance another...

5128
03:54:05,940 --> 03:54:06,980
Another armor thing.

5129
03:54:09,200 --> 03:54:09,800
I think.

5130
03:54:11,360 --> 03:54:11,720
Uhhh!

5131
03:54:12,200 --> 03:54:13,000
Yeah, I'll just do that.

5132
03:54:13,180 --> 03:54:13,540
Just...

5133
03:54:13,540 --> 03:54:14,820
To see if I can make it in time.

5134
03:54:16,860 --> 03:54:17,580
Oh, thank god.

5135
03:54:17,700 --> 03:54:18,200
Okay, nice.

5136
03:54:22,880 --> 03:54:23,240
Alright.

5137
03:54:26,700 --> 03:54:28,940
Okay, and then I'll save...

5138
03:54:32,160 --> 03:54:33,080
Alright.

5139
03:54:33,720 --> 03:54:35,760
I should be super strong now.

5140
03:54:36,960 --> 03:54:38,960
Yes, the strength orb.

5141
03:54:44,220 --> 03:54:45,460
Give me the power!

5142
03:54:51,470 --> 03:54:52,450
The power!

5143
03:54:53,550 --> 03:54:54,350
You're alive?

5144
03:54:54,650 --> 03:54:55,370
Come with me.

5145
03:54:55,910 --> 03:54:57,350
I need Nobunaga to see this.

5146
03:54:59,370 --> 03:54:59,830
Yay!

5147
03:55:01,750 --> 03:55:02,790
She's alive!

5148
03:55:05,630 --> 03:55:06,090
Yay!

5149
03:55:14,400 --> 03:55:15,880
I didn't know you survived.

5150
03:55:16,700 --> 03:55:18,180
I already moved on.

5151
03:55:20,480 --> 03:55:21,840
The slow-mo run.

5152
03:55:21,960 --> 03:55:23,140
Yeah, I was like, really?

5153
03:55:23,720 --> 03:55:28,480
I honestly thought she was gonna get shot by an arrow while she was running slow-mo to us.

5154
03:55:28,760 --> 03:55:29,200
It's time to go.

5155
03:55:29,200 --> 03:55:30,500
It was just such a good moment.

5156
03:55:30,900 --> 03:55:31,180
Why?

5157
03:55:32,400 --> 03:55:33,620
I thought she was gonna get shot.

5158
03:55:34,480 --> 03:55:35,600
I'll finish this.

5159
03:55:35,920 --> 03:55:36,440
Alone.

5160
03:55:39,800 --> 03:55:41,540
But I just got here!

5161
03:55:41,540 --> 03:55:41,660
Yeah.

5162
03:55:43,300 --> 03:55:45,580
You cannot be involved.

5163
03:55:48,180 --> 03:55:49,980
Your brother or me?

5164
03:55:50,280 --> 03:55:51,620
Who will you pick?

5165
03:55:53,200 --> 03:55:54,080
Me, of course.

5166
03:55:54,620 --> 03:55:55,800
I'm less evil.

5167
03:55:56,120 --> 03:55:56,860
And hot.

5168
03:55:57,920 --> 03:55:58,400
I...

5169
03:55:58,400 --> 03:55:58,840
Yeah?

5170
03:56:00,020 --> 03:56:00,740
Say it!

5171
03:56:01,100 --> 03:56:01,840
Say it!

5172
03:56:02,240 --> 03:56:03,080
Let him hear.

5173
03:56:08,680 --> 03:56:09,160
No!

5174
03:56:12,480 --> 03:56:13,580
Did she say it?

5175
03:56:13,620 --> 03:56:15,360
I don't know if she, like, whispered it.

5176
03:56:15,460 --> 03:56:16,660
I hope you find happiness.

5177
03:56:16,900 --> 03:56:17,740
Wait, what?

5178
03:56:20,540 --> 03:56:22,320
This is not a rent-a-girlfriend.

5179
03:56:22,320 --> 03:56:23,680
You cannot reject it.

5180
03:56:25,900 --> 03:56:28,740
I hope you find happiness.

5181
03:56:30,960 --> 03:56:31,860
That's right.

5182
03:56:32,500 --> 03:56:34,040
I friend-zone you.

5183
03:56:34,740 --> 03:56:36,820
I hope Nobunaga heard this.

5184
03:56:36,980 --> 03:56:38,640
I broke your sister's heart.

5185
03:56:38,900 --> 03:56:39,700
That's right.

5186
03:56:39,880 --> 03:56:41,260
This is worse than me.

5187
03:56:41,940 --> 03:56:43,040
Than me.

5188
03:56:43,420 --> 03:56:44,560
Banging your sister.

5189
03:56:44,920 --> 03:56:46,920
I made her fall in love with me.

5190
03:56:47,040 --> 03:56:48,820
And then I broke her heart.

5191
03:56:49,200 --> 03:56:50,620
That's right, Nobunaga.

5192
03:56:50,620 --> 03:56:51,680
You saw that?

5193
03:56:55,940 --> 03:56:58,720
Now she'll always think about me.

5194
03:56:59,040 --> 03:57:01,000
No matter who she dates.

5195
03:57:01,200 --> 03:57:03,240
She'll always think about me.

5196
03:57:05,760 --> 03:57:06,920
That's hardcore.

5197
03:57:08,900 --> 03:57:09,880
That's right.

5198
03:57:10,000 --> 03:57:11,560
I broke your sister's heart.

5199
03:57:12,840 --> 03:57:18,780
I just transferred my power into this golden- Wait, that's what the statue was for?

5200
03:57:19,080 --> 03:57:19,920
Holy shit.

5201
03:57:19,920 --> 03:57:21,040
That's sad.

5202
03:57:21,240 --> 03:57:21,540
That's sad.

5203
03:57:21,960 --> 03:57:22,880
Oh my god.

5204
03:57:22,880 --> 03:57:23,940
It looks so evil.

5205
03:57:26,720 --> 03:57:27,580
Holy shit.

5206
03:57:27,760 --> 03:57:29,400
Look how evil this statue looks.

5207
03:57:36,190 --> 03:57:36,670
There.

03:57:36,930 --> 03:57:37,850
Thank you for the super chat.

5209
03:57:38,010 --> 03:57:38,230
Thank you.

5210
03:57:38,370 --> 03:57:38,790
Thank you.

5211
03:57:39,070 --> 03:57:40,510
Golden evil statue.

5212
03:57:42,870 --> 03:57:45,630
Oh, that statue does look super evil.

5213
03:57:46,070 --> 03:57:46,770
What the fuck?

5214
03:57:48,850 --> 03:57:49,910
Holy shit.

5215
03:57:51,330 --> 03:57:52,210
What the fuck?

5216
03:57:52,270 --> 03:57:53,710
You could be that this entire time?

5217
03:57:55,410 --> 03:57:56,050
Fire.

5218
03:57:56,750 --> 03:57:57,390
Fire.

5219
03:57:58,130 --> 03:57:58,770
Fire.

5220
03:58:00,170 --> 03:58:01,050
Wait, what?

5221
03:58:02,330 --> 03:58:02,710
Wait.

5222
03:58:03,310 --> 03:58:04,970
Oh, you think just cause you can fly?

5223
03:58:08,010 --> 03:58:08,490
Tornado.

5224
03:58:09,490 --> 03:58:09,970
Tornado.

5225
03:58:10,390 --> 03:58:10,870
Tornado.

5226
03:58:12,450 --> 03:58:13,250
Oh shit.

5227
03:58:13,550 --> 03:58:14,130
Oh, I'm sorry.

5228
03:58:17,690 --> 03:58:18,450
Oh, wait.

5229
03:58:18,530 --> 03:58:19,010
What the fuck?

5230
03:58:19,230 --> 03:58:19,330
Wait.

5231
03:58:19,790 --> 03:58:20,270
Wait.

5232
03:58:20,270 --> 03:58:21,370
How do I shoot that?

5233
03:58:22,270 --> 03:58:22,570
Wait.

5234
03:58:22,810 --> 03:58:23,050
I didn't know.

5235
03:58:24,090 --> 03:58:25,090
Wait a minute.

5236
03:58:25,650 --> 03:58:26,550
What do I do now?

5237
03:58:29,790 --> 03:58:30,310
Okay.

5238
03:58:31,270 --> 03:58:32,050
That's fine.

5239
03:58:32,230 --> 03:58:32,830
I'll just do this.

5240
03:58:35,530 --> 03:58:36,230
That's fine.

5241
03:58:36,230 --> 03:58:36,970
I'll just do that.

5242
03:58:38,350 --> 03:58:38,870
Fire!

5243
03:58:43,540 --> 03:58:44,500
That's fucking right.

5244
03:58:47,600 --> 03:58:48,080
Oh.

5245
03:58:48,740 --> 03:58:48,940
Oh.

5246
03:58:50,260 --> 03:58:50,740
Um.

5247
03:58:51,840 --> 03:58:52,320
So.

5248
03:58:53,040 --> 03:58:54,280
What do I do now?

5249
03:58:55,700 --> 03:58:56,180
Wait.

5250
03:58:56,320 --> 03:58:57,000
Does this hit him?

5251
03:58:57,160 --> 03:58:57,820
Oh, it does.

5252
03:58:57,940 --> 03:58:58,100
Nice.

5253
03:58:58,320 --> 03:58:58,820
Oh shit.

5254
03:58:58,980 --> 03:58:59,800
But that hits me.

5255
03:59:02,100 --> 03:59:02,580
Okay.

5256
03:59:03,520 --> 03:59:03,660
Uh.

5257
03:59:04,560 --> 03:59:06,660
Let's just use the medicine now.

5258
03:59:10,620 --> 03:59:11,100
Wait.

5259
03:59:11,200 --> 03:59:11,980
That doesn't hit him.

5260
03:59:12,440 --> 03:59:13,120
Wait a minute.

5261
03:59:13,220 --> 03:59:14,260
What the fuck do I do?

5262
03:59:16,640 --> 03:59:17,260
Do I just dodge?

5263
03:59:17,340 --> 03:59:17,960
Oh, I just dodge.

5264
03:59:18,860 --> 03:59:19,480
Okay.

5265
03:59:21,660 --> 03:59:23,140
Get down from here!

5266
03:59:25,220 --> 03:59:27,440
This should not have fixed camera angles.

5267
03:59:27,540 --> 03:59:29,140
I'm sorry, but like...

5268
03:59:29,860 --> 03:59:32,400
This should not have fixed camera angles.

5269
03:59:32,860 --> 03:59:33,480
This...

5270
03:59:34,380 --> 03:59:36,180
That's actually bullshit.

5271
03:59:38,640 --> 03:59:39,880
Not gonna lie.

5272
03:59:40,640 --> 03:59:44,100
If anything, this fight should not have...

5273
03:59:44,640 --> 03:59:45,840
Oh my god.

5274
03:59:48,360 --> 03:59:49,100
What is he?

5275
03:59:49,980 --> 03:59:50,340
What?

5276
03:59:54,500 --> 03:59:55,560
Oh, keep hitting him.

5277
03:59:55,700 --> 03:59:56,520
Don't let him recover.

5278
03:59:56,760 --> 03:59:56,940
Okay.

5279
04:00:05,430 --> 04:00:06,270
Oh my god.

5280
04:00:06,450 --> 04:00:06,610
Okay.

5281
04:00:06,990 --> 04:00:07,550
Okay, now I know.

5282
04:00:08,430 --> 04:00:09,630
I don't know what that did.

5283
04:00:09,790 --> 04:00:12,430
I was like trying to hit him, but I felt like it didn't do anything.

5284
04:00:14,650 --> 04:00:16,870
I thought it didn't do anything at all there at first.

5285
04:00:16,870 --> 04:00:18,150
Oh, Jesus Christ.

5286
04:00:23,360 --> 04:00:24,860
Oh no, not the tornado.

5287
04:00:27,480 --> 04:00:28,080
Please!

5288
04:00:28,360 --> 04:00:30,120
I have to deal with fixed camera angles!

5289
04:00:34,840 --> 04:00:36,220
This is not fair!

5290
04:00:42,140 --> 04:00:43,260
Oh my god.

5291
04:00:46,900 --> 04:00:48,080
Oh my god.

5292
04:00:51,540 --> 04:00:52,760
Oh my god.

5293
04:00:52,760 --> 04:00:53,340
My place!

5294
04:00:53,360 --> 04:00:55,340
I'm not trying to figure out where it's where!

5295
04:00:58,060 --> 04:00:58,660
Okay.

5296
04:00:59,060 --> 04:01:00,840
I'll use the hammer for this.

5297
04:01:08,160 --> 04:01:09,100
Am I...

5298
04:01:09,920 --> 04:01:11,040
Am I doing anything?

5299
04:01:12,080 --> 04:01:13,280
I can't...

5300
04:01:14,980 --> 04:01:16,480
I think I am!

5301
04:01:20,170 --> 04:01:20,670
Nice!

5302
04:01:23,190 --> 04:01:24,110
Wait, is...

5303
04:01:24,110 --> 04:01:25,030
Do I have enough for fire?

5304
04:01:25,170 --> 04:01:25,570
I do.

5305
04:01:26,910 --> 04:01:27,410
Fire!

5306
04:01:28,310 --> 04:01:28,830
Fire!

5307
04:01:28,830 --> 04:01:29,230
Oh shit!

5308
04:01:30,210 --> 04:01:30,730
Fire!

5309
04:01:31,050 --> 04:01:32,410
Okay, I think...

5310
04:01:38,500 --> 04:01:39,020
Okay.

5311
04:01:40,780 --> 04:01:41,560
What does he do?

5312
04:01:41,660 --> 04:01:42,000
Whoa!

5313
04:01:43,400 --> 04:01:45,080
Okay, I didn't know what that did.

5314
04:01:45,240 --> 04:01:45,400
Okay.

5315
04:01:46,140 --> 04:01:47,080
I swear to god.

5316
04:01:47,800 --> 04:01:48,840
Can I dodge that?

5317
04:01:49,020 --> 04:01:50,300
I SWEART!

5318
04:02:03,170 --> 04:02:03,690
Like...

5319
04:02:04,310 --> 04:02:07,110
I can't do anything about it!

5320
04:02:17,190 --> 04:02:18,650
I don't know what to do.

5321
04:02:21,900 --> 04:02:22,200
I...

5322
04:02:22,500 --> 04:02:22,840
I...

5323
04:02:22,840 --> 04:02:23,160
Oh my god.

5324
04:02:23,380 --> 04:02:24,560
I literally have to...

5325
04:02:24,560 --> 04:02:24,780
Invin...

5326
04:02:24,780 --> 04:02:25,460
Invin...

5327
04:02:25,460 --> 04:02:26,180
Frame him.

5328
04:02:26,400 --> 04:02:26,700
Right there.

5329
04:02:27,160 --> 04:02:28,440
I'm literally...

5330
04:02:28,440 --> 04:02:28,740
I...

5331
04:02:28,740 --> 04:02:30,360
Invincible framed him.

5332
04:02:30,480 --> 04:02:30,720
Right there.

5333
04:02:30,920 --> 04:02:32,120
Oh my god.

5334
04:02:32,440 --> 04:02:32,980
I...

5335
04:02:32,980 --> 04:02:34,480
I had to like...

5336
04:02:38,080 --> 04:02:39,320
Oh my god.

5337
04:02:39,580 --> 04:02:41,480
I used invincibility frame.

5338
04:02:41,740 --> 04:02:42,400
For him.

5339
04:02:47,930 --> 04:02:48,450
Oh shit.

5340
04:02:48,450 --> 04:02:49,050
That's stupid.

5341
04:02:49,290 --> 04:02:50,210
Fucking tornado.

5342
04:02:52,330 --> 04:02:53,730
Oh my god!

5343
04:02:56,990 --> 04:02:57,670
I...

5344
04:02:57,670 --> 04:02:58,750
I framed it!

5345
04:03:03,020 --> 04:03:03,220
I...

5346
04:03:03,220 --> 04:03:03,600
Oh...

5347
04:03:03,600 --> 04:03:05,300
The fuck did he do?

5348
04:03:07,840 --> 04:03:08,180
What?

5349
04:03:18,110 --> 04:03:18,790
Be...

5350
04:03:18,790 --> 04:03:19,330
Be still.

5351
04:03:19,810 --> 04:03:20,850
Be still.

5352
04:03:24,410 --> 04:03:25,270
Oh no.

5353
04:03:25,790 --> 04:03:26,590
How do I...

5354
04:03:30,860 --> 04:03:32,100
Did he pachinko?

5355
04:03:34,780 --> 04:03:36,220
Oh my god, the eclipse.

5356
04:03:36,360 --> 04:03:37,520
Don't stare at the eclipse, guys.

5357
04:03:38,280 --> 04:03:40,560
Unless you have your special glasses.

5358
04:03:40,960 --> 04:03:41,580
Huh?

5359
04:03:41,900 --> 04:03:43,740
I must believe in the only way.

5360
04:03:44,520 --> 04:03:45,280
Believe.

5361
04:03:46,100 --> 04:03:46,660
It will guide me!

5362
04:03:47,360 --> 04:03:48,580
It will guide me!

5363
04:03:48,580 --> 04:03:49,320
It will guide me!

5364
04:03:58,030 --> 04:03:58,750
Oh shit.

5365
04:03:59,410 --> 04:04:00,410
Oh my god.

5366
04:04:01,990 --> 04:04:03,210
I'm digivolving.

5367
04:04:05,390 --> 04:04:07,390
Oh power rangers.

5368
04:04:07,590 --> 04:04:09,210
Oh you're captain planet!

5369
04:04:09,790 --> 04:04:10,270
Children!

5370
04:04:10,810 --> 04:04:12,290
Power up your rings!

5371
04:04:13,450 --> 04:04:14,650
How do I...

5372
04:04:16,310 --> 04:04:16,990
How...

5373
04:04:16,990 --> 04:04:17,830
How do I...

5374
04:04:17,830 --> 04:04:18,530
How...

5375
04:04:18,530 --> 04:04:19,970
I don't fucking know how to kill him.

5376
04:04:20,850 --> 04:04:22,030
I don't know how to kill him.

5377
04:04:23,530 --> 04:04:24,450
Oh, okay.

5378
04:04:27,550 --> 04:04:28,230
Okay.

5379
04:04:29,650 --> 04:04:30,330
Okay.

5380
04:04:30,490 --> 04:04:31,250
I literally...

5381
04:04:31,250 --> 04:04:32,510
Run around and I...

5382
04:04:32,510 --> 04:04:32,870
Okay.

5383
04:04:32,870 --> 04:04:34,510
This is our goofy boss fight.

5384
04:04:34,570 --> 04:04:35,250
Not gonna lie.

5385
04:04:35,550 --> 04:04:36,030
This...

5386
04:04:36,770 --> 04:04:38,770
This boss fight is so goofy.

5387
04:04:39,090 --> 04:04:39,950
What the...

5388
04:04:41,930 --> 04:04:42,710
Oh shit!

5389
04:04:42,890 --> 04:04:43,430
Oh I'm sorry!

5390
04:04:43,630 --> 04:04:44,170
I didn't...

5391
04:04:44,170 --> 04:04:45,510
I didn't touch that!

5392
04:04:46,390 --> 04:04:46,870
What?

5393
04:04:47,290 --> 04:04:48,010
I'm sorry.

5394
04:04:48,090 --> 04:04:49,330
I did not mean it like that.

5395
04:04:49,830 --> 04:04:51,230
I didn't mean it like that.

5396
04:04:51,410 --> 04:04:52,790
But like how do I kill that?

5397
04:04:53,710 --> 04:04:54,190
Like...

5398
04:04:54,190 --> 04:04:55,050
Are you serious?

5399
04:04:58,770 --> 04:04:59,830
Oh my god.

5400
04:05:00,010 --> 04:05:00,870
Oh my god.

5401
04:05:00,870 --> 04:05:02,490
He runs at me.

5402
04:05:12,280 --> 04:05:13,080
Oh my god.

5403
04:05:13,620 --> 04:05:14,720
He runs at me.

5404
04:05:17,560 --> 04:05:20,600
What do I do when he does the laser move though?

5405
04:05:20,960 --> 04:05:21,680
Like what do I do?

5406
04:05:21,760 --> 04:05:22,060
Oh okay.

5407
04:05:22,160 --> 04:05:22,960
I walked to the side.

5408
04:05:23,160 --> 04:05:23,300
Okay.

5409
04:05:23,820 --> 04:05:23,960
Okay.

5410
04:05:24,640 --> 04:05:26,180
Looks like you heard you.

5411
04:05:31,280 --> 04:05:32,520
What the fuck?

5412
04:05:33,940 --> 04:05:35,140
Just run to the side.

5413
04:05:37,620 --> 04:05:38,100
Okay.

5414
04:05:39,700 --> 04:05:40,220
Oh!

5415
04:05:42,120 --> 04:05:42,640
Oh!

5416
04:05:42,720 --> 04:05:44,980
Run run run run run run run!

5417
04:05:45,960 --> 04:05:46,480
Whoa!

5418
04:05:47,340 --> 04:05:48,440
Wait what do I do here?

5419
04:05:48,680 --> 04:05:49,000
Oh!

5420
04:05:54,960 --> 04:05:56,000
Oh my god.

5421
04:05:57,500 --> 04:05:58,780
What the fuck?

5422
04:06:00,700 --> 04:06:01,220
Okay.

5423
04:06:03,800 --> 04:06:04,760
Oh my god.

5424
04:06:04,880 --> 04:06:06,120
Oh I can block the fire attack?

5425
04:06:06,320 --> 04:06:06,440
Okay.

5426
04:06:06,540 --> 04:06:07,160
That's good to know.

5427
04:06:08,360 --> 04:06:09,420
That's good to know.

5428
04:06:09,580 --> 04:06:10,580
I'm just gonna run.

5429
04:06:10,980 --> 04:06:11,980
I'm just gonna...

5430
04:06:11,980 --> 04:06:12,500
The side!

5431
04:06:14,740 --> 04:06:15,300
Okay.

5432
04:06:15,660 --> 04:06:16,220
Okay.

5433
04:06:16,220 --> 04:06:16,960
I got his legs.

5434
04:06:19,280 --> 04:06:20,480
Got your legs!

5435
04:06:21,580 --> 04:06:22,360
Oh my god.

5436
04:06:22,620 --> 04:06:23,580
Just keep running.

5437
04:06:23,860 --> 04:06:24,440
Just keep running.

5438
04:06:27,040 --> 04:06:28,320
Run to the side!

5439
04:06:29,640 --> 04:06:31,100
I got your arm!

5440
04:06:35,280 --> 04:06:36,160
Oh my god.

5441
04:06:36,260 --> 04:06:36,800
Just keep running.

5442
04:06:36,800 --> 04:06:38,040
Just keep running.

5443
04:06:39,140 --> 04:06:40,580
Just keep running.

5444
04:06:41,460 --> 04:06:42,620
Just keep running.

5445
04:06:43,380 --> 04:06:44,320
Just keep running.

5446
04:06:44,320 --> 04:06:44,900
Get off!

5447
04:06:46,940 --> 04:06:47,620
Oh my god.

5448
04:06:48,120 --> 04:06:48,360
Okay.

5449
04:06:49,280 --> 04:06:49,740
That's fine.

5450
04:06:51,620 --> 04:06:52,200
What?

5451
04:06:52,200 --> 04:06:53,340
Like what in my fight?

5452
04:06:55,620 --> 04:06:56,720
What the fuck?

5453
04:06:56,940 --> 04:06:57,980
What the fuck?

5454
04:07:01,580 --> 04:07:02,640
What the fuck?

5455
04:07:04,120 --> 04:07:04,700
Okay.

5456
04:07:04,980 --> 04:07:05,380
That's fine.

5457
04:07:05,800 --> 04:07:06,140
That's fine.

5458
04:07:06,600 --> 04:07:07,380
Wait what's that?

5459
04:07:09,660 --> 04:07:11,320
Wait what the fuck is that?

5460
04:07:11,700 --> 04:07:12,500
Oh shit!

5461
04:07:12,500 --> 04:07:13,340
Okay.

5462
04:07:13,580 --> 04:07:13,640
Okay.

5463
04:07:13,640 --> 04:07:14,580
I got confused.

5464
04:07:16,420 --> 04:07:18,460
I didn't know what that fuck was.

5465
04:07:19,340 --> 04:07:20,820
Like it's understandable.

5466
04:07:21,300 --> 04:07:22,780
I got a little confused.

5467
04:07:27,940 --> 04:07:28,360
Okay.

5468
04:07:28,920 --> 04:07:29,820
Run to the side.

5469
04:07:34,700 --> 04:07:35,280
Okay.

5470
04:07:37,200 --> 04:07:37,560
Alright.

5471
04:07:37,560 --> 04:07:38,180
Oh my god.

5472
04:07:39,340 --> 04:07:40,060
Oh my...

5473
04:07:40,060 --> 04:07:40,560
Shield.

5474
04:07:41,820 --> 04:07:42,180
Shield.

5475
04:07:43,440 --> 04:07:43,800
Shield.

5476
04:07:43,940 --> 04:07:44,360
Shield no no no no.

5477
04:07:44,480 --> 04:07:45,200
I could heal the time.

5478
04:07:47,240 --> 04:07:47,940
Oh my god.

5479
04:07:48,080 --> 04:07:48,640
I could shield the time.

5480
04:07:48,640 --> 04:07:48,940
Ah!

5481
04:07:49,420 --> 04:07:51,960
I don't have heals!

5482
04:08:00,080 --> 04:08:00,540
I actually don't have heals!

5483
04:08:00,540 --> 04:08:07,040
Please please please please please please I actually don't have any heals for this!

5484
04:08:11,960 --> 04:08:12,420
What?!

5485
04:08:12,420 --> 04:08:13,420
You got Soraka's Shield!

5486
04:08:13,640 --> 04:08:14,760
You got Soraka's Shield!

5487
04:08:15,140 --> 04:08:15,600
Noooo!

5488
04:08:23,350 --> 04:08:25,310
Oh my god, oh my god!

5489
04:08:25,550 --> 04:08:26,950
I have the Talisman!

5490
04:08:30,650 --> 04:08:31,530
Oh my god!

5491
04:08:31,830 --> 04:08:33,630
Oh my god, I hate these guys!

5492
04:08:35,110 --> 04:08:36,550
Oh my god, no!

5493
04:08:36,970 --> 04:08:39,460
Oh my god!

5494
04:08:45,780 --> 04:08:46,300
No!

5495
04:08:56,030 --> 04:08:56,730
Holy shit!

5496
04:08:56,990 --> 04:08:57,650
Holy shit!

5497
04:08:57,990 --> 04:08:58,250
No!

5498
04:08:59,230 --> 04:08:59,830
These guys!

5499
04:09:02,170 --> 04:09:03,550
He's spamming attacks!

5500
04:09:03,810 --> 04:09:25,240
I don't know what to- No!

5501
04:09:26,180 --> 04:09:26,600
No!

5502
04:09:27,720 --> 04:09:28,060
No!

5503
04:09:28,280 --> 04:09:28,280
No!

5504
04:09:40,400 --> 04:09:41,920
Wait, EK's keepsake?

5505
04:09:42,060 --> 04:09:42,680
What does it do?

5506
04:09:44,000 --> 04:09:45,060
What does it do?

5507
04:09:49,770 --> 04:09:50,530
Oh my god!

5508
04:09:50,730 --> 04:09:51,930
Oh my god, that's so fair!

5509
04:09:52,190 --> 04:09:52,990
That's not fair!

5510
04:09:53,310 --> 04:09:54,210
That's actually not fair!

5511
04:09:58,640 --> 04:10:02,420
Oh my god!

5512
04:10:02,860 --> 04:10:07,370
Oh my god!

5513
04:10:07,370 --> 04:10:08,630
I am saved!

5514
04:10:09,150 --> 04:10:09,830
I am- He

5515
04:10:13,210 --> 04:10:15,070
will rise again!

5516
04:10:16,070 --> 04:10:17,250
Oh thank god!

5517
04:10:17,410 --> 04:10:18,370
Thank you, EK!

5518
04:10:18,950 --> 04:10:20,030
Thank you!

5519
04:10:20,610 --> 04:10:23,770
I knew killing you was a good idea!

5520
04:10:27,530 --> 04:10:28,670
How'd he do it?

5521
04:10:29,290 --> 04:10:30,310
See, guys?

5522
04:10:30,670 --> 04:10:32,590
Killing him wasn't a mistake.

5523
04:10:35,870 --> 04:10:36,530
Oh!

5524
04:10:38,730 --> 04:10:39,890
Wait, what?

5525
04:10:40,650 --> 04:10:42,730
Oh my god, we did it!

5526
04:10:43,030 --> 04:10:43,450
Oh!

5527
04:10:43,730 --> 04:10:44,870
We fucking did it!

5528
04:10:45,490 --> 04:10:46,970
That was so scary!

5529
04:10:47,630 --> 04:10:50,230
I didn't think we were gonna make- We did it, guys!

5530
04:10:50,830 --> 04:10:52,510
That was genuine fear!

5531
04:10:53,150 --> 04:10:55,630
That was actual, genuine fear!

5532
04:10:57,630 --> 04:10:59,230
That's how it ends?!

5533
04:10:59,230 --> 04:11:00,610
He just runs?!

5534
04:11:00,610 --> 04:11:03,690
And he just- That's it?!

5535
04:11:03,690 --> 04:11:06,930
That's how it ends?!

5536
04:11:09,270 --> 04:11:11,010
My last health potion!

5537
04:11:11,930 --> 04:11:12,770
Oh!

5538
04:11:15,130 --> 04:11:16,750
You got the bad ending?

5539
04:11:17,050 --> 04:11:17,750
That's fine!

5540
04:11:18,350 --> 04:11:20,090
I got an ending!

5541
04:11:20,510 --> 04:11:21,630
That's fine!

5542
04:11:27,070 --> 04:11:28,230
Oh my god!

5543
04:11:29,530 --> 04:11:30,650
I'm so happy!

5544
04:11:31,550 --> 04:11:34,110
It's because I chose the wrong woman!

5545
04:11:43,670 --> 04:11:48,810
I didn't think- I didn't think- I didn't know I won't go back!

5546
04:11:49,150 --> 04:11:52,530
I didn't- I thought I would return to the village!

5547
04:11:52,850 --> 04:11:56,970
How was I supposed to know I got greedy?!

5548
04:11:58,930 --> 04:12:01,370
I wanted two women!

5549
04:12:01,850 --> 04:12:03,710
I was like, WHOA!

5550
04:12:03,830 --> 04:12:05,890
I wonder who that other woman was!

5551
04:12:12,290 --> 04:12:14,530
Oh, Jesus Christ!

5552
04:12:16,310 --> 04:12:18,670
That was- That was really fun!

5553
04:12:18,950 --> 04:12:21,330
That was a fucking weird-ass story!

5554
04:12:21,770 --> 04:12:23,130
But, like, I had a lot of fun!

5555
04:12:23,850 --> 04:12:27,330
I- I'm just surprised I remember nothing about this game!

5556
04:12:27,850 --> 04:12:32,330
I remember nothing about this game when I was growing up!

5557
04:12:32,870 --> 04:12:35,190
All- All- All I could remember was the village.

5558
04:12:35,410 --> 04:12:38,010
Like, I remember the village and the- The main character.

5559
04:12:38,270 --> 04:12:39,330
But, like, nothing else.

5560
04:12:39,530 --> 04:12:44,090
So, It's crazy, but- Because there was so many wild things going on in this game.

5561
04:12:44,230 --> 04:12:46,610
I don't understand how I could not remember anything from it.

5562
04:12:50,250 --> 04:12:53,130
Yeah, it was very historically accurate, chat.

5563
04:12:53,430 --> 04:12:54,450
But we did it!

5564
04:12:54,570 --> 04:12:55,990
We beat another game!

5565
04:12:57,250 --> 04:12:57,610
Oh!

5566
04:12:58,090 --> 04:12:59,290
That was really fun, though!

5567
04:13:00,170 --> 04:13:04,750
I had a- Oh, Dad wants to- Dad wants to pee, guys.

5568
04:13:05,050 --> 04:13:06,030
But thank you all...

5569
04:13:06,030 --> 04:13:06,730
Thank you all...

5570
04:13:07,230 --> 04:13:07,810
...for watching.

5571
04:13:07,910 --> 04:13:09,370
Is there an after credit scene, chat?

5572
04:13:10,190 --> 04:13:13,570
Chat, is there- Is there an after credit scene after this?

5573
04:13:14,530 --> 04:13:16,310
I- How could I for- I know, right?

5574
04:13:16,510 --> 04:13:18,290
How the fuck could I forget?!

5575
04:13:18,290 --> 04:13:19,470
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!

5576
04:13:19,730 --> 04:13:22,230
And the greatest swordsman of all time!

5577
04:13:25,550 --> 04:13:31,470
I can't believe I could forget- The greatest swordsman of all time.

5578
04:13:31,830 --> 04:13:33,410
Say his name, chat.

5579
04:13:34,010 --> 04:13:34,950
Say his name.

5580
04:13:38,310 --> 04:13:40,450
Gaugandantus is pretty memorable.

5581
04:13:40,770 --> 04:13:42,130
Of all demons.

5582
04:13:45,150 --> 04:13:46,990
How could you forget?

5583
04:13:48,870 --> 04:13:49,670
Gaugandantus!

5584
04:13:53,750 --> 04:13:56,390
The greatest swordsman of all demons.

5585
04:13:57,190 --> 04:14:01,210
Oh, I hope everybody names their children after Gaugandantus.

5586
04:14:01,510 --> 04:14:02,950
What a guy.

5587
04:14:03,530 --> 04:14:04,870
What a hero.

5588
04:14:07,130 --> 04:14:08,210
Anyway, guys.

5589
04:14:09,270 --> 04:14:10,750
I'm tired now.

5590
04:14:13,370 --> 04:14:14,650
I just need to know.

5591
04:14:14,790 --> 04:14:17,890
Is there an after-credits scene chat before I leave?

5592
04:14:19,110 --> 04:14:20,390
I just need to know that.

5593
04:14:20,910 --> 04:14:22,110
There is a small scene?

5594
04:14:22,330 --> 04:14:23,670
Alright, we'll wait for the after-credits.

5595
04:14:24,050 --> 04:14:25,030
I'm so tired.

5596
04:14:25,810 --> 04:14:27,490
Oh my god, I'm so tired.

5597
04:14:27,690 --> 04:14:33,350
You know, like, by the way, I had to, like, try and see, like, how long... Dad, please!

5598
04:14:33,510 --> 04:14:34,290
I'm almost done!

5599
04:14:34,450 --> 04:14:35,930
I have to see, like, no key!

5600
04:14:36,430 --> 04:14:37,070
Come on!

5601
04:14:37,830 --> 04:14:38,450
Come on!

5602
04:14:38,890 --> 04:14:39,510
Come on!

5603
04:14:40,250 --> 04:14:41,990
Okay, he's, like, extra demanding.

5604
04:14:42,190 --> 04:14:43,150
He was like, I need to pee!

5605
04:14:43,530 --> 04:14:44,410
I want to pee!

5606
04:14:45,210 --> 04:14:52,030
Okay, but, like, um... I... Oh my god, he lost my train of thought.

5607
04:14:52,290 --> 04:14:52,910
I actually...

5608
04:14:52,910 --> 04:14:57,350
Okay, I... Oh yeah, I looked up, like, no commentary walkthrough, like, just to see how far...

5609
04:14:57,350 --> 04:14:59,370
like, where I was at, and how far it was.

5610
04:14:59,590 --> 04:15:01,470
They finished this game in five hours.

5611
04:15:01,830 --> 04:15:02,470
I think...

5612
04:15:03,130 --> 04:15:06,170
I think... And then it took me, like, what?

5613
04:15:07,270 --> 04:15:08,710
Five, six, seven hours?

5614
04:15:08,990 --> 04:15:09,850
Seven to eight hours?

5615
04:15:10,010 --> 04:15:19,370
But yeah, they finished this game in five hours, and I was like, okay, to be fair, if you minus all the time it took me on puzzles, maybe... Maybe I would get close to that amount.

5616
04:15:21,210 --> 04:15:21,970
I don't know what I mean.

5617
04:15:22,450 --> 04:15:23,170
Come on.

5618
04:15:23,810 --> 04:15:24,110
Don't worry.

5619
04:15:24,530 --> 04:15:25,510
We're almost done.

5620
04:15:25,690 --> 04:15:26,430
We're almost done.

5621
04:15:26,790 --> 04:15:27,970
We're almost done.

5622
04:15:28,550 --> 04:15:28,810
Hey!

5623
04:15:29,310 --> 04:15:30,670
Hey, we're almost done.

5624
04:15:31,050 --> 04:15:31,250
Okay?

5625
04:15:31,610 --> 04:15:32,390
We're almost done.

5626
04:15:32,690 --> 04:15:33,050
Let's wait.

5627
04:15:33,190 --> 04:15:33,710
Five more...

5628
04:15:33,710 --> 04:15:35,390
I'm waiting for the after-credits scene!

5629
04:15:35,510 --> 04:15:37,330
I'm waiting for the after-credits scene!

5630
04:15:39,350 --> 04:15:40,050
Hang it!

5631
04:15:40,370 --> 04:15:41,290
Yeah, he did.

5632
04:15:41,450 --> 04:15:42,450
He went closer.

5633
04:15:42,590 --> 04:15:44,810
He was like, did you not hear me, bitch?

5634
04:15:44,870 --> 04:15:46,670
I need walkies now!

5635
04:15:50,710 --> 04:15:53,070
He was like, do you not hear me?

5636
04:15:54,550 --> 04:15:55,290
All right.

5637
04:15:58,770 --> 04:15:59,290
Please!

5638
04:15:59,650 --> 04:16:00,710
We're so close!

5639
04:16:01,170 --> 04:16:02,210
Give me five minutes!

5640
04:16:02,550 --> 04:16:03,870
We're in for five minutes!

5641
04:16:04,030 --> 04:16:04,910
We're almost there!

5642
04:16:17,100 --> 04:16:19,300
Oh, it's so... What happened to my robot horse?

5643
04:16:19,460 --> 04:16:20,740
I worked so hard for it!

5644
04:16:27,100 --> 04:16:27,620
What?

5645
04:16:27,620 --> 04:16:30,340
I worked so hard for... What happened to it?

5646
04:16:32,360 --> 04:16:33,680
No robot horse.

5647
04:16:33,880 --> 04:16:35,640
It really is the bad ending.

5648
04:16:35,880 --> 04:16:36,620
What the fuck?

5649
04:16:40,820 --> 04:16:42,660
Why is it a normal horse?

5650
04:16:43,040 --> 04:16:44,980
I put it in the stable and everything!

5651
04:16:48,820 --> 04:16:50,920
Me, thank you for the ten gift of ships.

5652
04:16:51,080 --> 04:16:51,820
Thank you, thank you.

5653
04:16:51,820 --> 04:16:54,920
There's no power relents to recharge it.

5654
04:16:55,180 --> 04:16:55,720
No!

5655
04:16:56,140 --> 04:16:58,120
Where is my electric car charger?

5656
04:17:05,300 --> 04:17:08,140
Look, I have to live with my mistakes, okay?

5657
04:17:08,620 --> 04:17:13,300
I didn't save scum because then I will never learn.

5658
04:17:13,560 --> 04:17:15,220
This is a lesson for me.

5659
04:17:17,540 --> 04:17:19,420
Never get too greedy.

5660
04:17:19,880 --> 04:17:21,260
This was a lesson.

5661
04:17:23,600 --> 04:17:25,900
At least I got a cool sword.

5662
04:17:31,260 --> 04:17:33,560
You never learn anyway!

5663
04:17:33,820 --> 04:17:34,620
You don't know that!

5664
04:17:34,880 --> 04:17:38,860
I learned... Don't worry, I finally will learn next time.

5665
04:17:39,160 --> 04:17:40,320
Next game, I'll learn.

5666
04:17:41,660 --> 04:17:43,720
I'll learn from my experience.

5667
04:17:44,340 --> 04:17:46,140
I'll remember my lesson.

5668
04:17:50,440 --> 04:17:53,220
Back to my stupid regular horse.

5669
04:17:58,360 --> 04:17:59,780
God damn it.

5670
04:18:00,960 --> 04:18:03,380
Oh, he's reborn as a crow!

5671
04:18:03,900 --> 04:18:04,540
I knew it!

5672
04:18:04,540 --> 04:18:07,500
There's a demon inside of all crows.

5673
04:18:11,200 --> 04:18:12,100
Alright, guys.

5674
04:18:12,380 --> 04:18:13,600
I'm gonna head off now.

5675
04:18:13,780 --> 04:18:15,440
I'm sorry it's very abrupt ending, but...

5676
04:18:15,720 --> 04:18:19,620
Dad really wants his walkies, so I can't stall anymore for him.

5677
04:18:19,860 --> 04:18:23,600
But thank you all for coming, for watching me play on, uh...

5678
04:18:24,740 --> 04:18:26,280
Oh wait, what is this?

5679
04:18:26,780 --> 04:18:28,760
Oh, I guess I didn't see it.

5680
04:18:30,000 --> 04:18:31,120
Alright, play time.

5681
04:18:31,300 --> 04:18:31,840
Six hours.

5682
04:18:32,500 --> 04:18:32,980
There's...

5683
04:18:32,980 --> 04:18:34,760
Phantom Realm Floors.

5684
04:18:35,580 --> 04:18:36,440
51 saves.

5685
04:18:36,580 --> 04:18:37,060
Hey, B!

5686
04:18:37,280 --> 04:18:38,100
That's a pass!

5687
04:18:40,260 --> 04:18:40,740
Hey!

5688
04:18:41,740 --> 04:18:43,100
That's a pass, guys!

5689
04:18:46,960 --> 04:18:48,180
Oh, anyway, guys.

5690
04:18:48,680 --> 04:18:50,800
Um, it's great trying... playing Onimusha, too.

5691
04:18:51,260 --> 04:18:52,380
Um, I had a great time.

5692
04:18:52,560 --> 04:18:55,700
It's nice going through memory lane again, even though I forgot all my memories.

5693
04:18:55,920 --> 04:18:57,160
Of this game.

5694
04:18:57,520 --> 04:18:58,660
But, uh...

5695
04:18:58,660 --> 04:18:59,780
Thank you all for playing.

5696
04:19:00,020 --> 04:19:01,340
As always, everybody.

5697
04:19:01,880 --> 04:19:02,520
Stay high...

5698
04:19:02,520 --> 04:19:02,900
Oh, not play.

5699
04:19:03,000 --> 04:19:03,900
Thank you all for watching.

5700
04:19:04,280 --> 04:19:06,000
Sorry, I was the one that played the game.

5701
04:19:06,420 --> 04:19:07,320
Oh, thank you all for watching.

5702
04:19:07,700 --> 04:19:08,820
As always, everybody.

5703
04:19:09,100 --> 04:19:10,100
Stay hydrated.

5704
04:19:10,380 --> 04:19:10,880
Posture check.

5705
04:19:11,180 --> 04:19:12,860
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

5706
04:19:13,020 --> 04:19:14,680
And if you suffer me, head to bed.

5707
04:19:14,700 --> 04:19:15,940
Cause you deserve it.

5708
04:19:16,160 --> 04:19:17,200
I'm gonna go walk Dad now.

5709
04:19:17,320 --> 04:19:18,120
I'll see you guys next time.

5710
04:19:18,220 --> 04:19:18,820
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

5711
04:19:19,100 --> 04:19:19,580
Bye, everyone.

5712
04:19:19,920 --> 04:19:20,240
Bye!
