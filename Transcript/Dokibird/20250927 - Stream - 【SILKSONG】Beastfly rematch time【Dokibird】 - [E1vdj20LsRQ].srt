00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:08,400
Okay, before we begin, I really need to show you guys this really funny comment that I got today, or last night, on my sponsored video of me playing that Sonic Racing game.

5
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:17,460
I deleted the comment, but like, because I was like, I ain't having that on my channel, but it's actually...

7
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,360
I am allowed to shame you after that.

8
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,940
You consented now because you put yourself there, even though the comment is deleted.

9
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,780
All right, no, okay, I have to show this.

10
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,860
Okay, here you go.

11
00:02:52,750 --> 00:03:26,910
Fake fan Basic influencer aura Is showing Not in nearly enough Sonic games have been played Yes, that's why That was a sponsored video Not pre Grand Prix For Grand Prix The Yakuza guy There's so many Yakuza guys She didn't even bother to say bad or kazuga this because i've never played yakuza what do you

13
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,130
Like who he is.

14
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,550
Everyone knows.

15
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,250
Sega's Davis.

16
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,770
I don't know what that is referring to.

17
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:09,550
Oh, she saw that meme, but hasn't even seen Sonic Prime, which also has characters from that show in the game, too.

18
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,010
Skateboards?

19
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,090
They're not skateboards.

20
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,350
They don't even have wheels underneath them.

21
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,170
They are hover AirPods.

22
00:04:21,350 --> 00:05:52,550
boards also called in the sonic previous uh lore extreme gear so think like marty mcfly this ain't the new skate board game although tricks can still be performed in the air coins their rings too many mario games played hmm to be fair that i would give him that i i i my mind just automatically went to coins because it's just a it's just a default fucking currency in so many games so of course i went with coins because my brain defaulted to that um girl hasn't even been aware of the previous sonic rider series that probably featured the babylon who the fuck i still don't know who the fuck the babylon rouge are wow what an i was sponsored what do you mean i played three sonic games my entire life and it was I don't remember Sonic Sonic Sonic X DX was it the X Sonic DX um Sonic the newest Sonic game and then uh and the one where we were like filming filming a porno uh Sonic Adventure you know the um The banned Sonic game.

23
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:53,430
Remember that one?

24
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:54,990
The one that got banned?

25
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:55,630
Yeah.

26
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,750
It's Sonic Dreams.

27
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,550
I've only played three Sonic games.

28
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,610
Sonic Dream Collection.

29
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,650
Sad X.

30
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:08,750
And...

31
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,090
Wait, what was the third one that I named?

32
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:10,830
Are you freaking...

33
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,950
Oh, the newest one.

34
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,510
The one before the racing one.

35
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,810
One I can't believe.

36
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:17,670
I'm kidding.

37
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,170
Other than those mistakes.

38
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:48,370

41
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,270
I got shamed for it.

42
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,410
I still don't know.

43
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,030
Who the fuck are they?

44
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,190
Oh, it's like, who are these people?

45
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:34,470
I looked them up and I'm still like, who are they?

46
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,670
Are they from the comics?

47
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:42,670
Like, are they in any... Oh, they are a group that appears in the... What game have they appeared on?

48
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,750
Oh, only the racing ones.

49
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:46,230
Okay.

50
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,190
You know what?

51
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,290
No, that makes sense.

52
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,030
That makes sense.

53
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,810
They're literally only there in the racing games.

54
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:58,410
Because I was like, I was like, who are these people?

55
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:03,710
But no, they're only there for for all the racing games.

56
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,570
Yeah, literally only Sonic riding.

57
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,650
A simple-minded.

58
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:11,890
Thank you for the super chat.

59
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,230
Thank you.

60
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,790
Thank you.

61
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,590
Joki, you're such a Sonic poser.

62
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,590
How dare you!

63
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,010
Big fan!

64
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:31,330
But anyway, today is a special day for Silk Song because we are gonna have our rematch with our very favorite enemy, the Savage Beastfly.

65
00:09:31,830 --> 00:10:33,010
Um, I did farm, I did farm a little bit off stream for, uh, rosaries because, like, we're always broke in that game and I don't wanna, um, it was during a meeting too like meeting with my manager so like you know i made good use of my time just farming money while i was in that meeting um just going through all the stuff i have to do uh but we're not we're gonna be broke soon very soon the moment i spend all of this rosary because uh because this town is like i feel like i'm literally the only person with money in this town like that have spent something in 20 years and now they're trying to milk me as much as they can like literally there hasn't been any tourists in 20 plus years and that came in the town and then they suddenly jacked up all the prices they're like oh my god tourists is here and then they changed a five dollar water bottle to like 30 but like it's the only thing i can buy like it's like but it's the there's no other place for me to buy this water bottle i'm so thirsty

66
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:37,490
yeah yeah i'm like Oprah just moved into the neighborhood.

67
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,830
We got jacked up the prices now.

68
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,450
Can't have shit.

69
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,270
I'm the only one with money.

70
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,870
And they're trying to milk me as much as they can.

71
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,130
And I can't do anything to stop it.

72
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,010
I'm in a tourist trap.

73
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,330
Get me out.

74
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,490
I can't even leave the tourist trap.

75
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,670
trapped in a tourist trap.

76
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,630
I can't believe that's what it actually meant.

77
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,570
It's literal.

78
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,910
Okay, I'm gonna grab my cough drops real quick, guys.

79
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,870
Before we go, I'm kidding.

80
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,940
Guys, I don't know where I'm.

81
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,100
Oh, it's right next to me.

82
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,500
Okay.

83
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,920
Uh, all right.

84
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,280
It's actually right next to me.

85
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,940
I ordered it on Amazon.

86
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:58,620
Because, like, I didn't want to go out and get it yesterday.

87
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:05,400
So I just ordered it on, I just ordered, used my Amazon Prime and got it the next day.

88
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,100
I also ordered it in bulk, so I don't have to worry about buying more.

89
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,100
Alright, so, I'm, like, debating if I do it right up.

90
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:46,940

92
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,400
I don't remember.

93
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,260
Where does he live?

94
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,660
Yeah, I'm gonna have to warm up.

95
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,360
Because I have to buy, like, here, right?

96
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,100
He lives here.

97
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:01,620
Not flea.

98
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,120
Um, the, the, what are they?

99
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,880
What are they?

100
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,960
No, the, not the flea.

101
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,300
I don't even know what they are.

102
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,500
They're like ticks, right?

103
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,600
The ticks?

104
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,600
Because they have, like, really sharp needle noses.

105
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,820
The thieves, yeah.

106
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:20,980
The thieves.

107
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,240
They live here, right?

108
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,720
I don't remember where they live.

109
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,880
Because I need to buy stuff from them.

110
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,480
The Blastic Steps?

111
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,620
What the fuck is that?

112
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,100
I don't remember where they live.

113
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,300
Where the fuck is the Blastic Steps?

114
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,580
There's the slab.

115
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,180
Right next.

116
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,100
Oh, there it is.

Okay, there it is.

All right, we gotta go here.

All right, blast his steps.

120
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,540
Because I didn't spend my money before we do anything.

121
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,980
Return to the slab.

122
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,120

00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:08,880
Oh my god.

124
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,580
I think it makes me want to play more Sonic games.

125
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,960

00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,700
Alright, we'll grab this.

159
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,780
We'll grab the savage beast flight.

160
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,140
Here it is.

161
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,600
Here's the day.

162
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,600
And then...

163
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,340
I want to warm up a little bit before we go straight into the beast flight.

164
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,820
Give me a second.

165
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,420
I feel like... I don't... I feel like...

166
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:56,940
like it might be really fucking stupid to fight him right off the bat let me let me warm up just a little bit because all i did i was farming i don't think farming money was a good enough warm-up because i was literally just throwing my body onto until it died

167
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:14,840
all right okay if you guys really want really are hoping i first try this i definitely need a warm up.

168
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,480
Have you done it yet, Bellringer?

169
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:23,580
Wake wriggle deep, discover the depths of deception that brought this place so low?

170
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:28,320
If you speak of the citadel and the cell caretaker, then yes, I now know the start of it.

171
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:37,800
And the ward down below, I saw it clear, the hollow husk, and the many torturous implements, machines to instill a bug with thread that see their life extended.

172
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,780
Aye, that's it, in part, but there's more scale to it than all that.

173
00:18:43,160 --> 00:19:01,480
Just think of greedily shoving the silk into the shells the madness that over kingdom eternal life for mortal bugs then think on how long it's all gone on also that's why they can use silk that's what the hospital was they were in they were doing silk implants and then they went crazy

174
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:20,220
the children born of them and all the pilgrims after the silk has seated deep into this kingdom shell No wonder Fireloom's bugs prove such easy prey for that haunted thread, and only to seek for itself to reach them.

175
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,800
Ho, ho, now you're seeing it, Bellringer.

176
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:33,020
Those poor pilgrims, all born bound to the cruel system of our world, now stricken in its new cursed web.

177
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,360
You at least are free from it and free to shake it all up if that's your choosing.

178
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,980
All right, lore time.

179
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,760
All right, let's donate a little.

180
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:59,240
bit to to this place we'll give we'll give the monks some money we'll donate to them to their little temple i have everything all

181
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:18,560
right all right we're about to go okay i know there was something down here yeah i have to grab this uh all right this is a good practice Oh!

182
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,900
I thought he was gonna jump.

183
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:21,680
I thought!

184
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:22,460
Oh, no!

185
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,120
Guys, this is exactly why I need a warm-up.

186
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:27,820
This is...

187
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,760
Now do you guys know why I have to warm up now?

188
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,080
Instantly, piety.

189
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,920
What's this?

190
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,360
Oh, secret.

191
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,940
Now you know, guys.

192
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,940
Wait, it's just silk.

193
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,020
There's nothing else.

194
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,400
Oh, it's a silk eater.

195
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,340
Oh, shit!

196
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,040
Okay, thank God I'm warming up.

197
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,100
Guys, this does not look like I can first try a beast fly right now.

198
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,540
I don't think I'm ready yet.

199
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,900
Get this way.

200
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,000
How do I play it?

201
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,360
Oh, hello?

202
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,940
She carries a precious cylinder.

203
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,620
She must give it, share it, claw to claw.

204
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,500
Pass it, and this wallkeeper shall grant their wisdom.

205
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:42,580
Just a small taste, a trickle, a glimmer of a citadel's sacred understanding.

206
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,020
What happened to him?

207
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,820
Why does he look like that?

208
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,280
Why does he have like a worm?

209
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,580
Did he have like a parasite?

210
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,160
Whoa!

211
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,320
Yes, yes, she gives.

212
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,440
It is ours.

213
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,680
I have passed a relic, Valkkeeper.

214
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,440
Now uphold your promise and aid me with your insight.

215
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:09,480
For demanding of a Valkkeeper, hers is impudence enough to bring death.

216
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,580
If she did not carry the scent of Weaver's spy.

217
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,540
So you know something of my ancestry, learned Bug.

218
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,680
If it gains me favor here, I'll expect your service in full...

219
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,120
Oh!

220
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:25,740
Does that mean like her parents used to live here or something?

221
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:45,820
They're dead dead your vicious kind they're meant to be better than we thinks to say as such But this one was taught it shall fold its claws it shall pass its knowledge as much as a glend Only a first child must of all keep or defer

222
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:56,830
Oh Amen.

223
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,710
Yeah, I know her dad's a god.

224
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,490
Don't worry, I've been using that everywhere I go.

225
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:06,910
I was like, um, do you know who you're talking to?

226
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,630
My father is a god.

227
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,450
But I'm saying like her mom's side.

228
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,250
Because her mom used to live here.

229
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,830
Because they're like my ancestors.

230
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,740
Yeah, I'm listening to a bug propaganda.

231
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:40,420
I'm thinking like for the for the Sonic if I do another Sonic stream and say things like um oh yeah did you guys know Knuckles is also a hedgehog

232
00:23:51,800 --> 00:24:27,180
just little things I'll start with little things I'll start calling them coins even more and like I guys look my coins oh my god my coins the weaver spawn she has founded a positive sacred cylinder stolen from the dark below and then when i see tails i'll be like who's that guy who's that is that a new character oh he's a fox well i wonder why he has uh four tails

233
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,540
Never states our law.

234
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,100
Never must our melody pass to our bug.

235
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:45,920
Not Keeper, but you, fool, Weaver, will shatter those tenants with reckless age.

236
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,880
Your pontiff is gone, Vault Keeper.

237
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,260
The fellows have fallen to husk or thread.

238
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,100
What law once bound these vaults died with them.

239
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:55,960
Ha!

240
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,080
Fine, course she.

241
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,160
Claim the sacred song.

242
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,280
And paying to you if we are both are down forever for it.

243
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:05,260
Yay!

244
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,540
Let's play a song together.

245
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,250
And trusted, what did I do with it?

246
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,770
What can I do with your song?

247
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:33,490
music.

248
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,410
The soul of Varlum's eternal laid bare.

249
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,910
That, our cursed age, could still receive such blessing.

250
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,630
So, we respond.

251
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,410
Our melody is yours now.

252
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,410
Hell in mine, to carry beyond our walls.

253
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,530
Was the learning worth this feeling?

254
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,170
It was, well keeper.

255
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:52,150
I know to me your service continues.

256
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:56,070
Keep the cylinder safe along with my others, with any others I may bring.

257
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,770
What the fuck do I do with your son?

258
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,510
Can't even play it.

259
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:01,770
I can just play this.

260
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:02,870
Varlum!

261
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:13,130
reveal your secret all right never mind i'm too i don't want to listen to your son no more but it's like what do i do with it

262
00:26:18,170 --> 00:27:02,210

263
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,530
Okay, where is it?

264
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,310
Holy fuck, it's so far.

265
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:13,050
But, like, it won't be easier.

266
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,050
If I just go straight, I feel like it'd be easier.

267
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,590
I'll just get the main one up top.

268
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:21,150
And then, we'll do the savage beast.

269
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,090
Look, I have to warm up!

270
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:25,690
Banu.

271
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,470
Okay, that's the card core.

272
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,050
Okay.

273
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,180
All right, we go up.

274
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,460
You have rare chosen to have ascended this final threshold.

275
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:55,800
Listen to our wish, deliver it that you may rise above and see your pilgrimage end.

276
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,420
We will hear the song of the architects at the core of our citadel.

277
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,380
They used to sustain our realm, its walls, its floors, and its floors, even though sludders fall silent.

278
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,260
We'll hear the voice of keepers within their grand vaults.

279
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,800
They who guard a history are prayers and our secrets across the ages.

280
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,880
We'll hear the melody of the conductors high in their glimmering towers.

281
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,700
They bear in the heaviest mantle who are glad.

282
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,560
Oh wait, I can't access this.

283
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,380
We're jealous of our threefold song.

284
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,680
Oh yeah, this was the mission.

285
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:28,260
Whoops.

286
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:28,980
Oh, sorry.

287
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:30,840
Alright.

288
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,480
I just never talked to them, so I never knew.

289
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,180
That's crazy.

290
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:47,580
I've never talked to these people, so I didn't know I was supposed to do that until I until I until now stairs up or down to the right?

291
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,020
Like here?

292
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,520
Yeah, I'm like, how the fuck do I get there?

293
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:57,850
Here?

294
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,340
Oh.

295
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,640
I'm not gonna grab the one at the top.

296
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:09,960
Oh, there it is.

297
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,040
Oh, this is open.

298
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:13,340
open.

299
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:15,860
Oh.

300
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,160
What?

301
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,860
Oh, now I can go up.

302
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,340
Wee.

303
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,380
Wait, shortcuts downstairs?

304
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,180
Wee.

305
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,560
Oh, got the shirt.

306
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,540
Oh, I should grab the chair.

307
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,740
You're right.

308
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,160
Just in case.

309
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:48,070
All right.

310
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,350
Apaco.

311
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:53,210
Thank you for the elevator.

312
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,090
Oh, this looks very parkour-ish.

313
00:29:58,610 --> 00:29:58,610
Yep.

314
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,290
I fucking knew it.

315
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:06,150
I was like, this has to be parkour-related.

316
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:13,790
Yeah.

317
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,730
That's fine.

318
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,970
Oh, I thought I could out-perry that.

319
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,450
I thought I could be a gamer.

320
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:23,970
Wait, can I do this as a shortcut?

321
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,360
Oh, I'm not- I don't have- I have the hunter's crest.

322
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,680
Oh, fuck!

323
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,080
Okay.

324
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,500
Oh, nice.

325
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,100
I forgot I have the hunter's crest for this.

326
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,710
Yeah, I'm- what?

327
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,220
I go- what?

328
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,860
I'm a little confused.

329
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,700
Oh, there's a wall.

330
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,520
Oh, shit.

331
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,420
I didn't notice the wall.

332
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,220
All right, wait.

333
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:12,820
Give me a sec.

334
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,240
We're going to restart this.

335
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,100
I'm changing crest.

336
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,240
I don't care.

337
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,240
I don't want to make this harder for myself.

338
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,080
This feels like a Pogo map.

339
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,920
Like, I have.

340
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,260
I feel like I have to.

341
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,580
Yeah, I'm going to change crest.

342
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,960
This shit looks way too fucking tilting.

343
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,700
Way too tilting to do normally.

344
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,840
Oh wait, no, I shouldn't do that.

345
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,560
Uh...

346
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,420
Wait, I don't need it yet, actually.

347
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,640
We'll grab poison for now.

348
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,980
Wait, actually...

349
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,980
Do the binds.

350
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,600
Wait, what the fuck is this?

351
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,540
Oh, the silk.

352
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,700
No, it's fine.

353
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,540
I don't think...

354
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,700
Oh, actually...

355
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,480
We're going...

356
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,500
Actually, maybe.

357
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,620
So we can just grab more HP.

358
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,920
No, damage is better.

359
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,340
I think getting more silk if I get hit is better.

360
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,020
I think.

361
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,500
I feel like...

362
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,220
I feel like if I get damaged a lot...

363
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,810
Oh, if I get damaged a lot...

364
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,080
Then at least I can have...

365
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,380
I can regen myself for heals.

366
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:36,530
Hello.

367
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:39,870
Which is...

368
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:41,850
Oh shit.

369
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:44,730
Okay, I was...

370
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:45,610
That was just greedy.

371
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:47,770
That's greedy.

372
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:49,530
Um, um, actually.

373
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,270
Thank you for the super chat.

374
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:51,670
Thank you.

375
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:52,310
Thank you.

376
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,810
That was just pure greed.

377
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:05,270
Oh, I should have got the claws thing to make parkour easier.

378
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:08,050
It's literally right there too.

379
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:09,610
It's over here.

380
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,210
Why did it make me go there?

381
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,380
Oh my god, I forgot about these guys.

382
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,080
There you go.

383
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,120
Friend!

384
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,840
Wait, why do I like green?

385
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,820
Oh, it's from the...

386
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,560
It's from the damage that I took.

387
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:36,130
Ah!

388
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,010
Alright, too soon.

389
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,510
Became bug chowder.

390
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,130
Okay.

391
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:48,310
That scared me a little, but I'm okay.

392
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,110
Where do I go?

393
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:57,610
Oh?

394
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:58,450
No!

395
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:00,810
No!

396
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,770
Oh, please tell me that's down.

397
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,010
Oh, okay.

398
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,310
It is down.

399
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,230
5-3.

400
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,510
Do it again!

401
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:09,190
Oh!

402
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:10,450
No!

403
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:13,690
I slowly float down.

404
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:17,950
This area fucking sucks.

405
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,390
Okay.

406
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:32,120
Oh god damn it forgot that there was a gear there I hate this area

407
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,780
I'm not I'm not warmed up to pogo

408
00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:05,240
Guys I'm not warmed up enough to parkour

409
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,560
God I hope this doesn't mess me up though later

410
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,080
Oh, no.

411
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,000
No!

412
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,580
Oh, I don't feel so good.

413
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,720
Oh, my god.

414
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,360
I hate you.

415
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,640
Are you serious?

416
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,480
Are you fucking...

417
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,500
Oh, this is over.

418
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,160
It's so over for me.

419
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,220
Oh, we made it.

420
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,380
It's not over.

421
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,360

422
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:25,890
okay we'll ignore him ignore him what is this oh i just have to align oh i just have to align this is that alignable

423
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:30,210
Okay.

424
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:32,930
Oh, why is choice?

425
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,290
Yeah, I was like, nope.

426
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:35,950
How about no?

427
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,050
Are none of these alignable?

428
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,310
Oh, here it is.

429
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:47,050
Okay.

430
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:48,630
And then this.

431
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:49,950
There we go.

432
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,350
Oh, that's easy.

433
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,630
That's an easy.

434
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:56,670
Oh, they already did like half of this for me.

435
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,690
Not too bad.

436
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:01,310
This is a puzzle for babies!

437
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,940
Okay, none of these line up.

438
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,100
Is it?

439
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,140
Yeah, none of these line...

440
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,380
But this lines up.

441
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,240
Oh, wait, it doesn't.

442
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:18,960
Does it?

443
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,140
No, this doesn't.

444
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,040
Yeah.

445
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,320
Okay, now it lines up.

446
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:24,940
Okay, nice.

447
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,660
He's gotta do this then.

448
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,240
Huh?

449
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:32,800
Huh?

450
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:48,400
lines up what do you mean oh oh never mind there you go it was just like one thing that i couldn't see all right uh

451
00:37:52,840 --> 00:38:05,680
okay oh wait that's a they already did like three two of it for me that's nice of them There you go.

452
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,820
Last one.

453
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,040
Easiest puzzle in my life.

454
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,120
Maybe it's this...

455
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:17,580
Nope.

456
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:19,220
Nope.

457
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,920
Thing is, I don't know if they're repeating.

458
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,300
Oh wait, oh wait, no, never mind.

459
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:27,900
I said, I didn't!

460
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,560
Uh, nope.

461
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:31,900
Nope.

462
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,280
God damn it.

463
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,640
How about this one?

464
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,760
It's just, actually, it's just trial and error.

465
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,760
I'm the worst part is at the jump so far for this one.

466
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,740
Why did they put the lever on the right side?

467
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,480
And then built platforms?

468
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,340
Are they stupid?

469
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,120
Is the architect stupid?

470
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,280
Who paid for this architect?

471
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,880
If the handle is on the right, maybe put the platforms on the...

472
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:14,620
right side there is a wall what do you think every bug can walk that

473
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,890
not every bug can walk them

474
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:55,500
oh that's pretty This is where all the pilgrims taxpaying payers money went to.

475
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,840
One part of the three-fold memory.

476
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,720
Well, maybe I could just get the three memories right off the bat.

477
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,340
This is where it went to.

478
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,940
To build large ass...

479
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:13,580
To build these large ass MP3 players.

480
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,720
Oh my god.

481
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,980
What happened to that bug?

482
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,060
Wait, what?

483
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,100
I just go straight down?

484
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,680
Oh my god, I have to climb all the way down.

485
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,620
Oh my god.

486
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,280
Okay.

487
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:56,530
Okay.

488
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,080
I touched that.

489
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:34,840
fucking wall I was like yay I'm doing it I joked so many things I don't even know where my silk is where did it go no I did it again oh my god it's down there somewhere

490
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,100
Okay.

491
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,560
Oh, there it is.

492
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,140
Okay.

493
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:45,980
It's fine.

494
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,480
Oh, it's not fine.

495
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,080
Um...

496
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,440
I think I just have to go this way.

497
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,960
This might be easier to go down with.

498
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,800
Oh, so that's why they built these guys.

499
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,080
Alright, there you go.

500
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,480
Smooth sailing.

501
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,080
Oh.

502
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,120
That should be fine.

503
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:15,260
All right, let's sit on that chair so we don't get respawned back to the top.

504
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:16,860
Nice.

505
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,840
All right, now we'll get this other part.

506
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,720
They have to be all parkour, right?

507
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,380
Unless there's a boss fight for the third one.

508
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:34,740
Because I remember you guys were saying that the third one was also the hardest to get.

509
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,740
Oh, God, they're so tall.

510

512
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:22,310
Oh, well, I guess he'll starve.

513
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:24,690
I guess.

514
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,130
Oh, I forgot to change my crest.

515
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:26,450
Oh, wait.

516
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,210
There's a bench over there.

517
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,200
Are you serious?

518
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:32,820
He jumps?

519
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:34,960
That's it.

520
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,100
I ain't playing.

521
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:37,500
Oh, my God.

522
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,320
He's stealing myself.

523
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,480
Get out of here!

524
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,220
Fucking thief!

525
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:44,120
Oh, my God!

526
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:50,060
Okay, I didn't think he'd do that.

527
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:57,120
He stole my silk and killed and then used it against me.

528
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:58,800
What a whore.

529
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,040
Oh, I forgot.

530
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,340
Yeah, this is my...

531
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:07,480
Yeah, this is exactly why I need a warm-up.

532
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:15,430
Okay, where's my silk?

533
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:23,790
God, I need this warm-up.

534
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:26,330
This way.

535
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,480
Where's the chair?

536
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:33,840
Oh, there it is.

537
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,300
How the fuck?

538
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,320
How do I get there?

539
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,340
Oh, I missed it.

540
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,180
Okay, it's...

541
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:40,900
Alright, let's grab...

542
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,300
Let's change the crest.

543
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,520
Wait, is it parkour?

544
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,360
Guys.

545
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,220
Is it parkour?

546
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,020
Or is it...

547
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,180
Or is it...

548
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:50,720
Or is it...

549
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,040
Boss fight?

550
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:55,380
Kinda?

551
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:56,520
Yes?

552
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,000
Okay.

553
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:00,040
Do we need Pogo?

554
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:01,680
Do we need Pogo?

555
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,660
That is, like, the most important question.

556
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:04,960
Or I'll just use this crest.

557
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:06,520
Both?

558
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:07,120
Okay.

559
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:11,100
Apako.

560
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:14,780
Now use this, then.

561
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,600
Because I only use the wonder if I have to fight something.

562
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:23,080
Oh.

563
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,900
That's weird that it gave me a full bar of silk.

564
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,240
That's so weird.

565
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:30,120
Alright, before I unused the bathroom, actually.

566
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:33,220
Okay.

567
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,520
It's a little weird.

568
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:39,760
So I gotta have a pee break in case I get an angry pee out.

569
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:58,980
All right, I'm back, everybody.

570
00:47:59,260 --> 00:47:59,720
Yeah, thank you.

571
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:00,300
Let's super chat.

572
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:00,980
Thank you.

573
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:01,600
Oh, yeah, thank you.

574
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,080
Let's super chat.

575
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:02,280
Thank you.

576
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:03,860
Remember to drink water, fellow dragons.

577
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:05,080
Don't worry about me.

578
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,000
I got beer.

579
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,460
I'm hydrating as well.

580
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:10,960
Thank you, let's super chat.

581
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,400
Thank you.

582
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:11,980
Oh, my God.

583
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,260
I'm still thinking about that comment.

584
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,040
There's so many layers to it.

585
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:21,100
Okay, I was just thinking while I was angry peeing because that's where like you know like shower thoughts these are pee thoughts

586
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:46,300
you know how they're like they're like how they named the Avengers as the greatest crossover in history and I'm like bro I can name so many things that have a better crossover than the Avengers because the Avengers they all came from Marvel that's barely that's like they all came from Marvel.

587
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,180
That's barely a fucking crossover.

588
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,740
They are all owned under the same company.

589
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:57,900
Kingdom Hearts is a better crossover than fucking Avengers.

590
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:06,540
It's barely a crossover when they're all owned by the same fucking company.

591
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,040
Literally.

592
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:15,120
You could have named so many other games but you named the Avengers

593
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,900
What about Fortnite?

594
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,260
Oh, that's a lot of dead bodies.

595
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:27,380
Alright.

596
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:31,300
Sucks for those bugs that can't swim.

597
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,440
Oh, shit.

598
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:34,160
Wait.

599
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:35,740
Oh, shit.

600
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,940
Wait, I don't like these guys.

601
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,300
Oh, my god.

602
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:41,980
Okay, now I know.

603
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:43,860
Oh, my god.

604
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,160
Wait, he can keep calling?

605
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:45,640
them?

606
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,340
No, my buddy!

607
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:49,220
Oh, it's okay.

608
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:49,840
I can get it.

609
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:50,360
There you go.

610
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:52,700
Okay.

611
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,160
Now I know what you guys meant.

612
00:49:58,940 --> 00:49:59,780
It's not fair.

613
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,220
He has, like, little minions.

614
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,240
That ain't fair.

615
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,820
How dare you?

616
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,160
How dare you, bright-up minions?

617
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,760
If I could bring up my dragons, I would in a heartbeat.

618
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:15,960
Oh?

619
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:16,680
Oh.

620
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,660
Oh, that's a parry.

621
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,240
Okay.

622
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:24,940
Okay, they can parry, too.

623
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,660
If I could just chuck my dragoons at people, I would.

624
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:35,310
Okay, maybe I do need...

625
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:36,330
No, I don't need Pogo.

626
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:39,890
There you go.

627
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:40,830
Okay, that's right.

628
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:42,290
Your master's dead!

629
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:45,750
Wee!

630
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:51,110
Wait, why do I need Oh shit.

631
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:52,830
Wait, I don't like this.

632
00:50:58,390 --> 00:50:59,290
Oh my god.

633
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,130
Okay, I really don't like this.

634
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:09,310
I don't like how the water...

635
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:12,230
Okay, now I definitely don't like how the water pushes me back.

636
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:18,130
Oh, I should have brought the magnet too.

637
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,560
Alright, up I go.

638
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,500
You'd be like my little Pokemans.

639
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,040
I'd be like, go, dragon, go!

640
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,160
What's this?

641
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,500
Oh, that was just for money?

642
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,840
Are you fucking kidding me?

643
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:44,880
Does that mean it's down?

644
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,120
Oh, that means it's down.

645
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:47,920
Down is up.

646
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:54,810
Okay, I was gonna say, where do I go?

647
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:57,790
Okay.

648
00:51:58,630 --> 00:51:59,070
Unlock.

649
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,220
Hello.

650
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,940
I'm here to rob you.

651
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,960
Nimi, thank you for the raid.

652
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,000
Thank you, thank you.

653
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,620
We had a great stream, Nimi.

654
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,620
I don't know what you were playing, but I hope you had a good time.

655
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:19,400
Hello.

656
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:23,320
Today is the day where I fight the savage beast fly.

657
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:24,680
I have no map.

658
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:25,480
I'm lost.

659
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:28,380
Lottie, think of the Super Chat.

660
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:28,880
Thank you, thank you.

661
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,480
You're like the one trainer with five matches.

662
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,140
Magikarp.

663
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,260
Thank you for the Super Chat.

664
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:35,640
Thank you.

665
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:36,300
Thank you.

666
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,200
Dracles, come on.

667
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,860
Have higher expectations of yourself.

668
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:42,640
You're like my metapod.

669
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:48,180
Because at least a Magikarp, they can splash and move.

670
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,260
All you can do is harden.

671
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,280
It's shell plates and cogs.

672
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,800
That could be fashioned into flying.

673
00:52:58,180 --> 00:52:58,380
Okay.

674
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:59,020
Yeah, sure.

675
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,160
Oh, I can't.

676
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,200
I don't like...

677
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,380
How do I make it?

678
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:06,260
Oh, wow.

679
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:07,960
Too real.

680
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:14,920
See, you don't move and all you know is hard.

681
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,520
Oh, I need ore.

682
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:20,100
Okay.

683
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:29,360
Oh, God.

684
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:30,760
Oh, I'm...

685
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,180
This way too close for comfort right now.

686
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,200
I know this is the right way to go.

687
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,520
Oh, it has to be.

688
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:39,500
There's a lover here.

689
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,940
She knows us too well.

690
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,460
Thank you, Super Chat Allen.

691
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:46,480
Thank you, thank you.

692
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:49,120
Wish I have a map here.

693
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,020
We're secure when I need her.

694
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,580
Okay, Rosary.

695
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:54,020
Yay!

696
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:54,620
Oh, wait.

697
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:55,780
Am I robbing a baby?

698
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,400
That's right.

699
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,840
What's a baby gonna do with money anyway?

700
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,400
I'll miss the secret room.

701
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:07,560
Well, too late.

702
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,720
It's not that bad.

703
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:18,760
This looks...

704
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:18,780
Scary.

705
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:21,260
This place ain't that bad.

706
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:22,740
I just don't know where to go.

707
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,520
Because there's so many places to go.

708
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:28,600
Oh, there's a bench.

709
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:29,640
Oh, there's an elevator.

710
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:31,060
Nice.

711
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:32,600
Down, that's it.

712
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,400
Thank God I have money.

713
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,660
In this economy right now.

714
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:39,240
What's this?

715
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:40,820
Oh, oh, thank God.

716
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:41,100
Okay.

717
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:41,960
Map 2.

718
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:43,500
Hey, guys.

719
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,060
Thank you for the I'll give the shows, thank you, thank you.

720
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:57,240
Papa, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

721
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,400
I was a dokey mod once.

722
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,680
Oh, what's this?

723
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,980
Oh, is this, oh, it's an arena.

724
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:15,740
Oh, it's an arena.

725
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,940
No, not the arena.

726
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:23,520
Okay.

727
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,480
Okay, I gotta focus up for this.

728
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:37,020
Bravo!

729
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,980
Oh my god, and they can use poison?

730
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:41,980
Oh wait, it's my poison.

731
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,540
I accidentally used my poison.

732
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,420
Wait, I forgot I have tools.

733
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:48,620
That's right!

734
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:50,360
That's right!

735
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:51,200
Oh shit.

736
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:55,220
I have tools!

737
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,060
Okay, I want to get rid of these guys.

738
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:02,920
I hate them so much.

739
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:05,600
I forgot.

740
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,500
I have had...

741
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,160
Oh shit!

742
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:08,740
Not him!

743
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,840
I'm sure about him!

744
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,700
I heard lots of things about you!

745
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:21,360
Oh!

746
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,600
Okay, that's fine.

747
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,220
So, it's the hammer.

748
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:33,900

749
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:57,240

750
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:01,980
Are you serious?

751
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:02,960
A fucking bell?

752
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,440
That's it.

753
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:08,180
Give me your lunch money.

754
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:10,780
I have tools!

755
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,220
I keep forgetting, but I do have them.

756
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:22,590
Stupid bodyguide.

757
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:25,750
Oh no.

758
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:26,710
Oh no.

759
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:29,130
Oh no.

760
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:32,390
No!

761
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:38,140
I don't know!

762
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:40,940
Oh,

763
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,180
shit!

764
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,420
I don't know where to look at!

765
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:03,080
There's so many things to look at!

766
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:05,600
Okay, I'm gonna...

767
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,500
I keep accidentally using this.

768
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,560
Alright, uh, I need to...

769
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,260
Oh, I need to go back to the bench.

770
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,440
I was doing so good too.

771
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,480
It's a big voice.

772
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:22,020
They take up, like, 80% of the screen!

773
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:27,420
I almost had it.

774
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,040
I almost had it, too.

775
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:32,320
There was just too many big voice.

776
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,160
Okay, this is actually a good warm-up, though.

777
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,960
Oh, I thought I could.

778
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:38,980
I don't know.

779
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:42,300
There you go.

780
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,300
I'm a little bit brute-forcing this right now.

781
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:48,180
Alright, that's fine.

782
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,060
Go!

783
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:54,240
Oh, did not mean to accidentally ran into him?

784
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:03,780
Nice.

785
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:08,030
Boomerang!

786
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:09,270
Boomerang!

787
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:09,790
Boomerang!

788
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:10,550
Boomerang!

789
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:11,570
Boomerang!

790
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:13,470
Boomerang can't fail me!

791
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:17,690
Oh my god, this stupid, stupid silk eater.

792
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:21,290
Okay, I want to get rid of him first.

793
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:22,630
Oh, he's not dead?

794
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:24,010
Okay, now he is.

795
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:29,990
Okay, nice.

796
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:32,290
Okay, big boy time.

797
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:32,850
Chainsaw!

798
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:34,570
Chainsaw!

799
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:35,510
Chainsaw!

800
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:35,850
Chainsaw!

801
00:59:35,850 --> 00:59:37,630
Oh shit!

802
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:40,650
Chainsaw!

803
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:42,710
Get him away from me!

804
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:51,830
Oh my god, I almost forgot about.

805
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:52,870
There you go.

806
00:59:55,870 --> 01:00:03,190
Okay, I did almost use the majority of my tools, so I don't know about the next part.

807
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:08,590
I might have made an oopsie and used the majority of everything.

808
01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:11,590
Twin!

809
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:17,170
Okay, fine.

810
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:21,470
Okay, I'm gonna go use this for him.

811
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:23,870
Because I won't get him out of here fast.

812
01:00:25,870 --> 01:00:27,010
Okay, I think it's...

813
01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:27,990
Oh, it's not big boy time.

814
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:28,970
Yeah, that's good.

815
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:30,830
That's good.

816
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:35,450
Oh,

817
01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:40,070
that was an accident.

818
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:41,630
I did not mean to use chainsaw.

819
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:45,170
I wanted to kill him.

820
01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:49,110
Okay, this is where things get a little scary.

821
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:50,030
Chainsaw.

822
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:51,830
Just chainsaw.

823
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:54,630
Oh, I actually ran into him, but that's okay.

824
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:55,790
Oh.

825
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:04,760
oh my god oh my god get me out of here

826
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:34,400
okay okay oh okay i'm so scared yes second try oh my god okay i'm I used all the tools I had there.

827
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:36,600
Okay.

828
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,020
That was a good warm-up.

829
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:40,640
Okay, second try.

830
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,820
We did it.

831
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:45,300
I used everything I had.

832
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:48,720
All my util for this run.

833
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,960
A visitor.

834
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:54,100
Now this is rare.

835
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:59,560
Savage Beastfly won't stand a chance with this warm-up now.

836
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:00,540
This is it.

837
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:02,780
Warm up over.

838
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:03,720
I'm ready.

839
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,680
I'm ready for savage bees fly.

840
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:10,380
I must apologize for not rising to greet you.

841
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:16,160
After an age spent stickily, I found myself unable to lift from this bedchamber.

842
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:17,700
Is this your silk?

843
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:21,220
At least you're still able to poop out silk, though, right?

844
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:24,000
I hope.

845
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:25,400
Good pilgrim.

846
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:28,560
Oh, unless this is like for him to live forever type deal.

847
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:34,240
Oh, I hope you're a good pilgrim.

848
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:35,680
Arceladus shown you the courtesy.

849
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:37,300
Deserved, I would both devout.

850
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:37,900
To me again.

851
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:39,800
I've borne its hospitality.

852
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:40,700
Hospitality.

853
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,060
Well enough, aged one.

854
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:44,620
My sympathies, pilgrim.

855
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,520
We have fallen so far.

856
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:49,840
And now, sadly, we become seeking aid or understanding.

857
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,680
I fear I too shall disappoint.

858
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,780
Oh, so it's like a silk transfusion.

859
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:54,420
Yeah.

860
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:59,060
It's like, yeah, I was going to say, is it like an IV bag?

861
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,260
It's getting a silk transfusion.

862
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:06,380
He's just 90% silk now, holding it together.

863
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:13,240
And now, Sally, if I'm seeking aid or understanding, I fear I too shall disappoint.

864
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:16,220
Where you would ask, I have only my melody left to offer.

865
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:18,860
It is a simple thing, as small as of gifts.

866
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:23,200
But it's more special now, for it's been rarely heard in these quieted times.

867
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:29,400
Wait, is that the song where you just moaning in pain?

868
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:34,860
He's just like, I'm having a heart attack.

869
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:35,580
Oh.

870
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,080
I don't think that's what he's singing, but okay.

871
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:51,320
No.

872
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:55,580
He is trying, don't you.

873
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:58,440
Our song upon a silken thread.

874
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:00,140
Such beautiful sound.

875
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,700
So long, absent from our halls.

876
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:08,640
For memory, Melody, good pilgrim, shall likely be the last to receive it.

877
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:10,980
I mean, he is running out of silk.

878
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:17,420
I mean, I could give him my silk, but, like, I think I might need it more.

879
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:18,200
Sorry, I'm sorry.

880
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:19,600
I'm fighting the savage beast for that.

881
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:20,960
Oh, is he choking?

882
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:31,760
I could save his life because I do have unlimited silk, but I need to save the world right now, okay?

883
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:33,700
I can't be saving everybody.

884
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:54,240
in this place yeah what oh wait you're right but what's his silk type though you're right guys we don't know what his silk type is okay we're gonna be fighting savage beast fly we're gonna have other weapons okay okay

885
01:05:00,410 --> 01:05:10,520
uh don't put that here and this is a good loadout

886
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:22,780
oh fuck okay it's time it's fucking time oh my god i'm so nervous

887
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:42,740

888
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:47,770
I'm gonna full focus.

889
01:05:49,710 --> 01:05:50,950
Where is it?

890
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:53,350
It is.

891
01:05:54,310 --> 01:05:57,810
Track down the Savage Beastfly in Farfields.

892
01:05:57,970 --> 01:05:59,110
Okay, where's Farfields?

893
01:05:59,170 --> 01:05:59,390
Oops.

894
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:00,970
Oh, lost my silk.

895
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:05,110
Oh, okay.

896
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:07,020
My heart's beating so fast right now.

897
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:10,670
Where the fuck is Farfields?

898
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:13,690
God, this map is so big.

899
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:19,750
Apparently, I was reading about it, and they cut out so many things in Silk Song.

900
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:23,650
Like, the map, they showed, like, a concept art of what the map should be.

901
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:25,750
Like, what the original map was like.

902
01:06:26,030 --> 01:06:31,490
So, and they cut out, like, I think, like, 30% of the map.

903
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:37,150
Of the original map, which is crazy, because already it feels like a lot.

904
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:38,470
Okay, here.

905
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:44,400
Alright.

906
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:49,780
Oh!

907
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:57,280
He's fly too is where I fought the mech.

908
01:06:58,340 --> 01:06:59,540
Okay, I'll sit in the chair.

909
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:02,180
I- here?

910
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:03,680
That's his head, right?

911
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,060
So it should be here.

912
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:07,480
Alright.

913
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:15,120
It's down here.

914
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,980
I'm gonna farm silk off real quick.

915
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,340
I'm gonna farm silk off this one guy.

916
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:23,620
He's my silk farmer.

917
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,560
Because I know you respawn.

918
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:32,740
That's like, this is your purpose.

919
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:34,560
To be my farm.

920
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:34,780
Oh.

921
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,120
Oh, fuck.

922
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:40,460
My heart is beating so fast.

923
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,100
I've never...

924
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:42,660
Oh, my God.

925
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:43,660
I've never been so nervous.

926
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:50,280
We're full of silk.

927
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:50,760
Cool.

928
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,080
Calm down.

929
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:53,400
Oh.

930
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:54,680
Oh.

931
01:07:58,100 --> 01:07:58,500
Oh.

932
01:07:58,500 --> 01:07:58,680
Oh.

933
01:07:58,920 --> 01:07:59,980

941
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:23,190
I mastered the use of toys.

942
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:29,670
Warma was actually helpful.

943
01:10:30,570 --> 01:10:31,410
No way.

944
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:32,570
Baby, thank you.

945
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:33,790
That's it for chat.

946
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:34,250
Thank you.

947
01:10:34,710 --> 01:10:35,050
Thank you.

948
01:10:35,830 --> 01:10:36,510
Easy.

949
01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:38,210
Oh my god.

950
01:10:38,770 --> 01:10:40,390
You should have stayed in hell.

951
01:10:40,890 --> 01:10:43,570
You should have fucking stayed in hell.

952
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:46,970
Time to eat the shoe.

953
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:53,390
Let's go.

954
01:10:54,270 --> 01:10:54,550
Yay!

955
01:10:59,150 --> 01:11:01,150
It's shoe time.

956
01:11:03,150 --> 01:11:05,330
Melania, I believe this is yours.

957
01:11:05,790 --> 01:11:07,070
What a gamer.

958
01:11:07,650 --> 01:11:08,690
Cyber Dragon.

959
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:11,070
Thank you for the Akka Super.

960
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:11,690
Thank you.

961
01:11:11,830 --> 01:11:12,450
Thank you.

962
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:17,150
I hope she chooses a very expensive shoe.

963
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:30,610
Not only... I should get a boat... For those who don't know, I did see the clip that Temma will eat a shoe if I first try the Savage Beast Fly.

964
01:11:31,130 --> 01:11:35,970
So that's why I was so nervous and scared because I was like, oh my, that's so much fresh air.

965
01:11:36,470 --> 01:11:37,730
I deserve a bonus.

966
01:11:37,950 --> 01:11:45,450
I not only first try the Savage Beast Fly, but I did it with zero hits.

967
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:51,350
Zero, that's like a bonus.

968
01:11:51,710 --> 01:11:55,310
I should be able to choose the shoe at that point.

969
01:11:55,730 --> 01:12:00,290
No, I deserve to choose what kind of shoe she has to eat.

970
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:05,750
No damage.

971
01:12:06,190 --> 01:12:07,770
First try.

972
01:12:12,290 --> 01:12:12,850
All right.

973
01:12:13,310 --> 01:12:15,170
Now back to the...

974
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:18,750
Now that I finished the main game, let's go do the side quest now.

975
01:12:18,890 --> 01:12:21,430
Behold, the power of Duchess.

976
01:12:21,790 --> 01:12:22,150
Don't keep it.

977
01:12:22,530 --> 01:12:25,910
Ever since I became a Duchess, I just leveled up.

978
01:12:28,490 --> 01:12:30,250
My skills just improved.

979
01:12:30,410 --> 01:12:31,130
Who would have thought?

980
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:34,050
Royalty does make me a better person.

981
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:35,710
Oh, I'm George.

982
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:36,070
Thank you.

983
01:12:37,010 --> 01:12:38,210
Thank you.

984
01:12:39,550 --> 01:12:41,530
Eat two shoes.

985
01:12:43,330 --> 01:12:44,290
Oh, my gosh.

986
01:12:44,330 --> 01:12:45,630
My heart was beating so fast.

987
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:48,870
I got the Royalty.

988
01:12:48,890 --> 01:13:02,330
royal buff oh my god my heart is actually was actually beating so fucking much guys i was like so nervous i don't want to go oh yeah i'd go this way

989
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:12,760
no that that third area was actually it's such good worry about

990
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:25,900
because like it made me remember how to use tools because i forgot how to use tools earlier like, wait, I have, I have a boom, oh my god, okay.

991
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:30,400
I just realized I forgot to redo my, god damn it, stupid silk spiders.

992
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:35,400
I forgot to redo my, uh, my inventory.

993
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:39,780
Oh, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

994
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:42,380
Yeah, I used all my stuff perfectly there.

995
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:45,180
Oh, thank god I did that.

996
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:48,840
I think I did the third stage, the third arena.

997
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:54,700
It, like, made me be All right, poison.

998
01:13:58,230 --> 01:14:00,170
I feel like I need more tools in general.

999
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:00,790
Oh, wait.

1000
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:03,150
I gotta get the chainsaw back.

1001
01:14:09,010 --> 01:14:12,310
I'm glad I still remember how to fight that fucker too.

1002
01:14:13,310 --> 01:14:17,550
I was like, it's been 20 years since I saw that saw you.

1003
01:14:17,910 --> 01:14:23,310
I, like, my fucking muscle memory kicked back in after I bashed my head against the wall against him.

1004
01:14:29,290 --> 01:14:31,070
All right, don't worry.

1005
01:14:33,630 --> 01:14:34,810
I have it.

1006
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:41,080
I didn't go in the high halls to make the spiders.

1007
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:41,820
Okay, I got...

1008
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:43,740
Let me eliminate the spiders real quick.

1009
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,800
I shall be the only spiders left in this world.

1010
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:02,330
I didn't...

1011
01:15:02,330 --> 01:15:06,490
The scary part was that I actually got an iframe earlier.

1012
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:10,170
With my pogo.

1013
01:15:10,690 --> 01:15:11,590
I think I saw it.

1014
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:16,390
I should have been hit in one area, but I did an iframe pogo.

1015
01:15:17,990 --> 01:15:18,530
Oh,

1016
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:23,480
wait.

1017
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:24,720
I just realized.

1018
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:31,060
There's statues of the people I got the song from.

1019
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:36,760
Pilgrim, who would hold our strong within your shell?

1020
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:37,520
Rise above.

1021
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:41,620
Offer your most devout self onto our secret heart.

1022
01:15:58,150 --> 01:16:00,490
Okay, before I do, I gotta eliminate the spiders.

1023
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:04,790
I acknowledge you, my gamer chief.

1024
01:16:05,170 --> 01:16:07,810

Oh, here.

1050
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,120
That's where I robbed the baby.

1051
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:10,180
Oh my god, I have to do the parkour thing all over again.

1052
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:11,820
Okay.

1053
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:14,500
That's fine.

1054
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:21,820
I have to do the parkour thing.

1055
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:23,480
Oh, I opened the short.

1056
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:24,560
Oh, I don't?

1057
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:27,980
Really?

1058
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,260
Wait, where is this place?

1059
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,000
Try to remember how to get there first.

1060
01:18:39,710 --> 01:18:41,590
Oh, I can go up from the bench area?

1061
01:18:41,830 --> 01:18:43,090
Oh, I didn't know that.

1062
01:18:43,670 --> 01:18:44,490
Alright, we'll do that.

1063
01:18:45,730 --> 01:18:47,290
Next, thank you for the super chat.

1064
01:18:47,350 --> 01:18:47,890
Thank you, thing.

1065
01:18:48,010 --> 01:18:48,730
Yeah, that too.

1066
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:50,190
I gotta pay off the...

1067
01:18:50,190 --> 01:18:51,910
I gotta pay off the...

1068
01:18:52,810 --> 01:18:58,450
For spending 2k at one time, 1k on being royalty.

1069
01:18:59,310 --> 01:19:00,530
Okay, here it is.

1070
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:09,070
Oh.

1071
01:19:11,090 --> 01:19:11,610
Here?

1072
01:19:13,070 --> 01:19:14,090
Where is it?

1073
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:19,720
I pushed this?

1074
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:21,580
I know, I'm pushing a dead baby.

1075
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:26,000
Wait, no, it's not.

1076
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:30,280
Oh, here?

1077
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:39,660
Oh, it's here.

1078
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:42,320
I was like, I thought I was like waiting for...

1079
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:43,220
Wait, what?

1080
01:19:50,270 --> 01:19:51,070
I'm jumping!

1081
01:19:51,210 --> 01:19:52,750
Why can't I reach it?

1082
01:19:53,850 --> 01:19:56,290
Zechra, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1083
01:19:56,690 --> 01:19:57,430
Oh, there it is.

1084
01:19:57,730 --> 01:19:58,530
Poor grace.

1085
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:02,850
I was like wondering, why can't I fucking...

1086
01:20:02,850 --> 01:20:04,130
Oh my gosh, this is another boss fight.

1087
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:06,230
Oh, look, it's another baby.

1088
01:20:12,470 --> 01:20:13,450
Are you kidding me?

1089
01:20:15,050 --> 01:20:15,990
Oh my god, Chris.

1090
01:20:17,090 --> 01:20:18,150
Oh my god, okay.

1091
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:21,150
How do I struggle with this?

1092
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:22,610
But...

1093
01:20:22,610 --> 01:20:27,390
How do I struggle with this?

1094
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:31,110
But like, first tribe, savage beast fly.

1095
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:32,530
I don't understand.

1096
01:20:34,210 --> 01:20:34,830
Oh my...

1097
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,390
I hate them so much.

1098
01:20:40,770 --> 01:20:42,030
They're so annoying.

1099
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:43,430
They're actually so annoying.

1100
01:20:47,830 --> 01:20:48,870
Oh my god.

1101
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:50,870
Okay, I got heals in time.

1102
01:20:53,970 --> 01:20:55,670
Wait, just run?

1103
01:20:56,590 --> 01:20:58,150
Oh, they spawn forever?

1104
01:20:59,050 --> 01:20:59,890
Oh, my God.

1105
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:01,710
I can't...

1106
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:06,520
There's no way.

1107
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:09,380
There's no way they infinite spawn.

1108
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:10,500
Oh, my God.

1109
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:12,340
First try Savage Beastfly.

1110
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:14,400
But these spotters are the...

1111
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:16,440
These spotters...

1112
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,140
I didn't know!

1113
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:23,680
Get me out of here!

1114
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:24,400
No!

1115
01:21:26,660 --> 01:21:29,360
Harder than Beast Flag confirmed.

1116
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:31,100
Oh my god, I did it.

1117
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:32,580
Oh, I forgot to sit in a chair.

1118
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:33,680
I forgot.

1119
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:35,820
Wait, what?

1120
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:37,000
Is this yet?

1121
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:43,760
He's harder than Savage Beast Flag confirmed.

1122
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:48,100
They just don't stop.

1123
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:50,360
Oh, is it?

1124
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:50,780
Oh, here.

1125
01:21:53,420 --> 01:21:54,380
Oh, okay.

1126
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:57,780
I lost it all.

1127
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,460
There's a cooldown, okay guys?

1128
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:04,800
I used up all my...

1129
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:07,840
I used up all my cooldowns on Savage Beast Flat.

1130
01:22:12,370 --> 01:22:13,790
Let's sit down on this chair.

1131
01:22:15,930 --> 01:22:18,930
Even I can't beat Infinity, exactly.

1132
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:29,140
There you go.

1133
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:31,280
Alright.

1134
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:33,860
Pushing my dead baby.

1135
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:35,420
as a platform.

1136
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:38,620
There we go.

1137
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:50,020
Okay, I think it was here.

1138
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:51,660
Oh, God.

1139
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:52,060
Oh, God.

1140
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:52,900
Oh, God.

1141
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:53,360
Oh, God.

1142
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:54,120
Oh, God.

1143
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:54,520
Oh, God.

1144
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:54,740
Oh, God.

1145
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:56,000
Oh, God.

1146
01:22:56,060 --> 01:22:56,340
Oh, God.

1147
01:22:56,420 --> 01:22:56,820
Ah.

1148
01:22:59,100 --> 01:22:59,540
Okay.

1149
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:03,520
Alright.

1150
01:23:04,060 --> 01:23:04,660
It's okay.

1151
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:05,580
They can't get up here.

1152
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:06,980
Oh, and then there's more.

1153
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:08,020
Alright, let's see.

1154
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:13,440
Is that it?

1155
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:15,560
Did it disappear now?

1156
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:19,760
Are you gone?

1157
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:22,100
Are you all dead?

1158
01:23:27,690 --> 01:23:28,670
Oh, they're all dead now?

1159
01:23:28,890 --> 01:23:29,350
Yay!

1160
01:23:30,290 --> 01:23:31,690
That's fucking right.

1161
01:23:32,390 --> 01:23:34,150
Get out of here, spiders!

1162
01:23:35,970 --> 01:23:37,630
No more stealing my silk.

1163
01:23:39,270 --> 01:23:40,190
Alright, nice.

1164
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:42,390
They're now extinct.

1165
01:23:42,630 --> 01:23:45,030
I shall be the only spider left in this world.

1166
01:23:47,730 --> 01:23:48,370
Alright.

1167
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:51,570
Now that we've fixed that.

1168
01:23:52,210 --> 01:23:53,850
I guess we can go up now.

1169
01:23:54,590 --> 01:23:55,030
Wait, what?

1170
01:23:55,670 --> 01:23:56,910
How do we get there?

1171
01:23:59,010 --> 01:24:00,970
How do we get there?

1172
01:24:02,650 --> 01:24:04,690
Okay, instructions are a little unclear.

1173
01:24:08,970 --> 01:24:09,610
Uh...

1174
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:17,670
How the fuck do we get up there?

1175
01:24:18,650 --> 01:24:19,790
The elevator?

1176
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:32,180
Oh, the other elevator!

1177
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:34,360
Oh my god, I forgot about that guy.

1178
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:37,800
Okay, I was just like, Elevator?

1179
01:24:39,620 --> 01:24:40,580
What elevator?

1180
01:24:44,860 --> 01:24:48,460
Yeah, where I fought the cage, yeah, in the dancing room.

1181
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:50,440
Alright, we'll go here then.

1182
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:52,220
I forgot that.

1183
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:53,800
I forgot the main quest.

1184
01:24:56,420 --> 01:25:06,920
Look, The Savage Beast Fly Like was Took up all my memory space So I like instantly deleted Whatever the fuck I did before

1185
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:21,280
The moment I killed the savage Beast Fly Nothing else matters in life

1186
01:25:26,630 --> 01:25:35,930
Hey Jokey that one guy Short Hollow Knight Edition seems to be doing Numbers gotta say it was my intention For you to never upgrade your nail you goober I did say kinda

01:25:45,530 --> 01:25:46,370
Oh, that's beautiful.

1189
01:25:48,030 --> 01:25:48,670
Oh, it's lace.

1190
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:49,710
Hello there.

1191
01:25:53,490 --> 01:25:54,950
I heard she gets like a lot faster.

1192
01:25:55,690 --> 01:25:56,810
I forgot how to fight her.

1193
01:25:57,530 --> 01:26:00,650
She wasn't that memorable to me because it took me like two tries.

1194
01:26:00,930 --> 01:26:00,990
I think.

1195
01:26:03,450 --> 01:26:06,830
Sorry, the Jimmy don't... Oh, I should have got... I should have got parry.

1196
01:26:08,190 --> 01:26:09,190
I mean, it's not too late.

1197
01:26:10,070 --> 01:26:11,330
Oh my god, I ran into that!

1198
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:14,770
Oh my god, okay.

1199
01:26:16,850 --> 01:26:18,050
Okay, yeah, never mind.

1200
01:26:18,290 --> 01:26:18,970
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1201
01:26:19,230 --> 01:26:21,230
I don't know why I was, like, looking at my map.

1202
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:33,210
Okay, guys, I don't think I'm first trying her.

1203
01:26:50,210 --> 01:26:52,390
Oh my god, didn't dodge that?

1204
01:26:55,150 --> 01:26:55,710
Oh, fuck!

1205
01:26:56,150 --> 01:26:56,290
Okay.

1206
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:02,780
Oh, fuck!

1207
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:03,540
Okay, okay.

1208
01:27:03,940 --> 01:27:04,680
She's a...

1209
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:05,660
Her pattern is different.

1210
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:09,220
Oh, her pattern is a lot different.

1211
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:10,160
Where am I?

1212
01:27:10,580 --> 01:27:10,960
Okay.

1213
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:14,260
Alright, I understand her patterns, though.

1214
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:17,780
I don't remember how she played.

1215
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:19,600
And I was like, wait, I don't...

1216
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:20,660
This is so different.

1217
01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:22,080
Alright, we'll get Perry.

1218
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:23,780
I've rather changed for Perry.

1219
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:26,780
Alright, I understand, though.

1220
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,100
Don't worry, I've downloaded her.

1221
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:31,380
Yeah, she's also a lot faster.

1222
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:36,040
Fun.

1223
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:39,700
God damn it.

1224
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:40,840
I'm using all my dice.

1225
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:43,340
Now I like these tools.

1226
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:44,900
I think these tools are fine, right?

1227
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:47,560
Uh, yeah, these two are fine.

1228
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:49,560
Alright.

1229
01:27:54,250 --> 01:27:56,550
I have to be, like, less...

1230
01:27:56,550 --> 01:27:59,610
I can be aggressive, but I also have to be, like, super patient.

1231
01:28:02,650 --> 01:28:06,990
She wasn't that memorable to me, because it took me two tries to kill her last time.

1232
01:28:08,910 --> 01:28:10,470
So, like, I don't remember how to fight.

1233
01:28:10,670 --> 01:28:11,030
Beastflight!

1234
01:28:11,350 --> 01:28:14,530
I bashed my head for two hours, like, for, like, an hour straight.

1235
01:28:18,170 --> 01:28:19,530
a bike fighting him again.

1236
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:27,880
Oh, I wanted to parry first.

1237
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:30,900
There you go.

1238
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:43,880
Her parry is so... Her parry is so annoying.

1239
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:53,600
Okay.

1240
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:54,980
Wrong way.

1241
01:28:56,360 --> 01:28:56,560
What?

1242
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:02,460
Ah, I forgot to say that!

1243
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:03,720
Wait, did I say that?

1244
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:04,020
I said that in a bench.

1245
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:04,820
I said that in a bench.

1246
01:29:05,260 --> 01:29:07,240
I jumped in her.

1247
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:09,480
Oh, okay, she's...

1248
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:10,640
I have to focus.

1249
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:14,860
Oh, I legitimately, if I lose focus, it's over.

1250
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:16,000
I lose the rhythm.

1251
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:19,540
Do you remember now?

1252
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:24,880
I lose focus when I start yapping.

1253
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,280
Because she has, like, a rhythm to her.

1254
01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:36,730
I also want to use the parry more, too.

1255
01:29:37,210 --> 01:29:37,610
Jesus!

1256
01:29:37,910 --> 01:29:38,890
That's my parry!

1257
01:29:39,290 --> 01:29:39,830
Okay.

1258
01:29:41,950 --> 01:29:42,470
What?!

1259
01:29:42,470 --> 01:29:44,310
Okay, I thought I was gonna get the parry.

1260
01:29:44,470 --> 01:29:47,050
That's why I was super aggressive for it.

1261
01:29:50,290 --> 01:29:52,050
Jesus, her range is quick.

1262
01:29:52,310 --> 01:29:53,710
Her range is crazy!

1263
01:29:56,590 --> 01:29:57,710
Okay, I'm focused.

1264
01:29:57,910 --> 01:29:58,090
I'm focused.

1265
01:29:58,470 --> 01:29:59,650
I'm gonna focus up now.

1266
01:30:01,010 --> 01:30:02,110
Her range is crazy.

1267
01:30:05,660 --> 01:30:09,040
She's not the same as her first iteration.

1268
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:11,820
Yeah, she has a parry mix-up.

1269
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:30,480

Oh, she's so fast now.

1272
01:30:55,540 --> 01:30:56,780
Oops, wrong way.

1273
01:30:59,180 --> 01:31:01,120
Are you serious?

1274
01:31:01,820 --> 01:31:02,420
Okay, my turn.

1275
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,200
No, I didn't have enough!

1276
01:31:04,940 --> 01:31:05,880
I was trying to parry!

1277
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:12,160
But I didn't realize I didn't have my parry anymore.

1278
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:14,140
Oh, me too.

1279
01:31:17,790 --> 01:31:20,560
I wanted the parry not fair

1280
01:31:28,070 --> 01:31:56,400

01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:07,700
All right, here you go.

1282
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:16,000
I'm just gonna use, I'm gonna use like...

1283
01:32:21,450 --> 01:32:22,610
Here we go.

1284
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:22,910
Oh!

1285
01:32:24,370 --> 01:32:26,050
I actually didn't mean to...

1286
01:32:26,050 --> 01:32:27,330
God damn it!

1287
01:32:29,830 --> 01:32:30,350
Okay.

1288
01:32:32,410 --> 01:32:33,570
Are you serious?

1289
01:32:34,090 --> 01:32:34,550
That's fine.

1290
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,020
I'll use my tools.

1291
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:43,080
Where did she come from?

1292
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:48,420
Oh my god.

1293
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:51,500
Sometimes I'm like, where does she come from?

1294
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:54,840
Are you sick?

1295
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:57,320
Ah, she teleports!

1296
01:32:58,420 --> 01:33:00,380
She's reading me better than me!

1297
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:01,840
Oh my god, she's input reading.

1298
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:03,040
She's input reading.

1299
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:04,040
Oh, fuck this.

1300
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:06,040
I can't parry right now.

1301
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:07,200
She's too fast.

1302
01:33:08,540 --> 01:33:09,920
I'm not using parry.

1303
01:33:10,780 --> 01:33:11,800
She's way too fast.

1304
01:33:13,180 --> 01:33:14,900
She anti-aired me.

1305
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:17,040
Nothing personal.

1306
01:33:26,930 --> 01:33:27,070
Okay.

1307
01:33:27,710 --> 01:33:28,110
No, yeah.

1308
01:33:28,310 --> 01:33:28,710
For real.

1309
01:33:29,830 --> 01:33:30,730
I hate her.

1310
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:47,460
Okay, I accidentally ran into her.

1311
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,020
God damn it!

1312
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:52,800
I keep thinking she's gonna do...

1313
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:54,040
I...

1314
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:54,160
Oh!

1315
01:33:57,940 --> 01:33:59,220
I hate...

1316
01:33:59,220 --> 01:34:00,160
I hate this attack.

1317
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:02,940
I hate...

1318
01:34:03,980 --> 01:34:05,100
Oh, what?

1319
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:06,560
I did not jump there!

1320
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:15,760
Okay, that's fine.

1321
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:18,540
Oh my god.

1322
01:34:18,980 --> 01:34:19,980
Okay, that's okay.

1323
01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:25,620
I'm gonna be more patient.

1324
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:31,640
Okay.

1325
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:32,460
Okay,

1326
01:34:36,130 --> 01:34:38,410
that's good.

1327
01:34:40,670 --> 01:34:41,670
Oh, fuck.

1328
01:34:41,810 --> 01:34:42,770
Oh, I did an accident!

1329
01:34:43,130 --> 01:34:44,070
I was trying to use my tools.

1330
01:34:44,370 --> 01:34:45,690
I was trying to use my tools.

1331
01:34:46,130 --> 01:34:48,570
I didn't mean to use a thread storm.

1332
01:34:50,870 --> 01:34:52,670
I didn't mean to use my thread.

1333
01:34:53,370 --> 01:34:54,630
Oh, my God.

1334
01:34:55,870 --> 01:34:58,670
Sometimes it, like, doesn't read my...

1335
01:34:58,670 --> 01:35:02,590
Doesn't read my directional input.

1336
01:35:06,230 --> 01:35:06,650
Oh.

1337
01:35:09,510 --> 01:35:10,650
You still...

1338
01:35:10,670 --> 01:35:12,010
on this fight.

1339
01:35:13,670 --> 01:35:14,370
Okay.

1340
01:35:16,930 --> 01:35:18,390
I miss Baby Lace.

1341
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:27,220
Okay.

1342
01:35:35,180 --> 01:35:36,400
Oh my god.

1343
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:40,080
God damn it!

1344
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:42,140
Because I don't know where she'll TP.

1345
01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:47,580
Yeah.

1346
01:35:48,020 --> 01:35:49,240
Get out of here.

1347
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:51,740
Are you serious?

1348
01:35:54,220 --> 01:35:55,160
Are you serious?

1349
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:56,420
You're such a whore.

1350
01:35:58,940 --> 01:35:59,920
You're actually such a whore.

1351
01:36:08,410 --> 01:36:09,070
Okay.

1352
01:36:14,430 --> 01:36:15,570
I thought I dodged it too.

1353
01:36:16,690 --> 01:36:17,670
Are you serious?

1354
01:36:17,910 --> 01:36:18,890
Oh my god.

1355
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:25,500
No!

1356
01:36:25,940 --> 01:36:25,940
No!

1357
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:26,560
Ah!

1358
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:31,310
She baits me so hard!

1359
01:36:31,990 --> 01:36:35,310
She actually She's like she could read my mind.

1360
01:36:35,630 --> 01:36:40,010
She could actually read my mind She knows like she's thinking ten steps ahead.

1361
01:36:40,290 --> 01:36:47,590
I'm like doing it I'm like I'm like enjoying one step at a time and she's like ten steps ahead of me She knows my next life.

1362
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:49,290
She knows what I'm gonna eat tomorrow.

1363
01:36:49,630 --> 01:36:50,990
She knows my two-year plan

1364
01:36:57,170 --> 01:36:59,770
I don't even know my two-year plan

1365
01:37:06,790 --> 01:37:07,550

Okay, I thought she was gonna dodge.

01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:49,460

1374
01:38:04,390 --> 01:38:04,390

01:41:57,910 --> 01:41:58,450
Oh no.

1412
01:41:59,230 --> 01:41:59,950
This is bad.

1413
01:42:00,770 --> 01:42:01,750
This is bad.

1414
01:42:02,670 --> 01:42:03,390
This is so bad.

1415
01:42:08,910 --> 01:42:09,210
This is...

1416
01:42:09,830 --> 01:42:12,510
She did the double dash.

1417
01:42:12,990 --> 01:42:14,470
She double dashed it.

1418
01:42:14,530 --> 01:42:16,170
The moment I'm like, I figured you out.

1419
01:42:16,290 --> 01:42:17,390
She's like, did you really?

1420
01:42:17,690 --> 01:42:19,550
Did you really figure me out?

1421
01:42:23,970 --> 01:42:25,790
The double dash.

1422
01:42:27,830 --> 01:42:32,310
She's like, oh, you thought you figured me out, did you?

1423
01:42:32,930 --> 01:42:33,970
I did.

1424
01:42:34,330 --> 01:42:35,850
I thought I did.

1425
01:42:40,350 --> 01:42:41,850
Yeah, I don't have tools anymore.

1426
01:42:42,670 --> 01:42:43,450
But, oh my.

1427
01:42:47,510 --> 01:42:50,590
Okay, I need to remember when she does the jump there.

1428
01:42:51,370 --> 01:42:53,450
I'm regressing again.

1429
01:42:58,730 --> 01:43:00,410
Okay, this is...

1430
01:43:04,430 --> 01:43:04,910
Okay.

1431
01:43:15,710 --> 01:43:16,290
Oh, fuck.

1432
01:43:16,430 --> 01:43:16,930
I had to jump.

1433
01:43:17,910 --> 01:43:19,330
I forgot about jumping.

1434
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:26,860
Can you fire him silk off of you?

1435
01:43:30,110 --> 01:43:30,590
Bitch.

1436
01:43:32,990 --> 01:43:34,690
This is why your mom doesn't love you.

1437
01:43:35,390 --> 01:43:36,170
You're an orphan.

1438
01:43:37,730 --> 01:43:38,970
Yeah, where's your mom?

1439
01:43:40,070 --> 01:43:42,310
My mom is at least sleeping or dead.

1440
01:43:42,430 --> 01:43:44,590
I don't know which if this is a sequel or a prequel

1441
01:43:49,530 --> 01:43:54,830
At least I know I have a mom

1442
01:43:58,350 --> 01:43:59,270
Oh shit.

1443
01:43:59,670 --> 01:44:00,390
Okay, that was an accident

1444
01:44:03,730 --> 01:44:14,910
Okay Fuck, I didn't know she does that!

1445
01:44:16,070 --> 01:44:18,290
I thought I was being so clever.

1446
01:44:18,530 --> 01:44:20,370
I was like, oh, she's gonna do a double dash.

1447
01:44:20,730 --> 01:44:24,030
Let me just, let me just, like, float a little bit.

1448
01:44:24,130 --> 01:44:27,810
And then she fucking jumps down and slam dunks me to the floor.

1449
01:44:31,590 --> 01:44:36,870
She fucking slam dunks me on the floor while I was just, I was like, yay, let me float.

1450
01:44:37,470 --> 01:44:39,410
Both have mommy issues.

1451
01:44:40,030 --> 01:44:40,210
Don't care.

1452
01:44:40,490 --> 01:44:41,650
Thank you, the super chat.

1453
01:44:41,690 --> 01:44:42,870
Thank you, thank you.

1454
01:44:49,830 --> 01:44:50,510
Okay.

1455
01:44:55,630 --> 01:44:56,250
What?

1456
01:44:56,430 --> 01:44:56,670
Okay.

1457
01:44:57,630 --> 01:44:59,090
I reacted very poorly there.

1458
01:45:00,250 --> 01:45:01,210
Oh my god, you were ready to jump.

1459
01:45:02,370 --> 01:45:03,970
Oh my god, this is my worst run!

1460
01:45:06,070 --> 01:45:08,970
See everything!

1461
01:45:09,450 --> 01:45:10,950
He's protecting everything!

1462
01:45:12,810 --> 01:45:14,050
This was...

1463
01:45:14,050 --> 01:45:16,110
Now that's my worst run.

1464
01:45:17,690 --> 01:45:18,370
Oh.

1465
01:45:18,370 --> 01:45:18,810
Oh.

1466
01:45:19,430 --> 01:45:21,630
She read me, she read me like a book.

1467
01:45:21,730 --> 01:45:24,750
She now knows, like, she knows how I'm gonna die and everything.

1468
01:45:26,990 --> 01:45:29,290
She knows, she knows my retirement plan.

1469
01:45:29,650 --> 01:45:32,810
She knows when and how I'm gonna die.

1470
01:45:32,990 --> 01:45:33,890
She knows everything.

1471
01:45:35,330 --> 01:45:36,730
She downloaded me.

1472
01:45:43,820 --> 01:45:46,300
Like, my book was like an instruction guide.

1473
01:45:49,720 --> 01:45:51,060
God damn it, I need to remember it.

1474
01:45:55,820 --> 01:45:57,100
Oh, what?

1475
01:46:03,540 --> 01:46:03,920
No!

1476
01:46:06,950 --> 01:46:07,410
Okay.

1477
01:46:09,310 --> 01:46:10,190
God damn it!

1478
01:46:10,370 --> 01:46:13,510
I need to remember that's the jump button.

1479
01:46:14,050 --> 01:46:17,090
Like, that's when she jumps up, like right here.

1480
01:46:26,790 --> 01:46:31,190
I swear to God, I looked the others way, but like for some reason,

1481
01:46:35,750 --> 01:46:39,640
I was...

1482
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:39,740
Okay.

1483
01:46:41,060 --> 01:46:41,680
Danny remember.

1484
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:46,640
Yeah.

1485
01:46:47,540 --> 01:46:48,780
Jesus, that's the jump.

1486
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:49,500
That's the jump.

1487
01:46:53,980 --> 01:46:55,340
Stupid double dash!

1488
01:46:57,560 --> 01:46:58,460
Fuck this.

1489
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:02,880
I know this is not the run, but I'm doing that just because I can.

1490
01:47:07,340 --> 01:47:07,740
Okay.

1491
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:08,320
Nice.

1492
01:47:14,370 --> 01:47:16,570
Oh my god, this is stupid slash.

1493
01:47:19,990 --> 01:47:20,590
Friend?

1494
01:47:21,250 --> 01:47:23,710
Fuck, oh my god, fuck me too.

1495
01:47:26,030 --> 01:47:26,630
Oh

1496
01:47:32,130 --> 01:47:33,650
fuck, I'm too fast.

1497
01:47:34,930 --> 01:47:36,190
Oh my god, I was too fast.

1498
01:47:44,440 --> 01:47:45,580
Oh, did I do it?

1499
01:47:48,170 --> 01:47:49,450
Be in a dream!

1500
01:47:50,190 --> 01:47:51,250
That's why I'll push you off the edge.

1501
01:47:51,710 --> 01:47:51,930
Get off.

1502
01:47:52,010 --> 01:47:52,850
Get off the edge.

1503
01:47:55,770 --> 01:47:56,190
Oh.

1504
01:47:58,150 --> 01:47:59,630
Congratulations, Spider.

1505
01:48:01,170 --> 01:48:02,290
I felt your sting.

1506
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:06,230
And you bear the truth of my pathetic empty shell.

1507
01:48:06,990 --> 01:48:07,030
No.

1508
01:48:07,250 --> 01:48:08,950
I've always had the scent, child.

1509
01:48:09,190 --> 01:48:09,930
You are an old bug.

1510
01:48:10,470 --> 01:48:12,810
Yours is a life born entirely from Thread.

1511
01:48:12,930 --> 01:48:14,090
Wait, you're from Thread?

1512
01:48:16,370 --> 01:48:17,630
You're just silk?

1513
01:48:18,290 --> 01:48:18,670
Life.

1514
01:48:18,930 --> 01:48:19,990
You're too dangerous.

1515
01:48:20,190 --> 01:48:22,830
This week, wasting existence.

1516
01:48:23,710 --> 01:48:28,090
This was not life, just a tusk shaped to act as a child.

1517
01:48:29,330 --> 01:48:30,490
Yours was life, Peta 1.

1518
01:48:31,170 --> 01:48:33,470
No confuse your unique creation with its absence.

1519
01:48:34,110 --> 01:48:36,030
I've seen others make the same mistake.

1520
01:48:37,610 --> 01:48:39,730
Palatitude, Spider, from you.

1521
01:48:40,170 --> 01:48:41,150
Don't be gross.

1522
01:48:42,690 --> 01:48:44,450
Head on, climb up in a way.

1523
01:48:44,910 --> 01:48:47,630
You've earned your audience with the divine.

1524
01:48:48,450 --> 01:48:49,990
This is not the run.

1525
01:48:50,190 --> 01:48:52,230
Don't keep logic.

1526
01:48:52,670 --> 01:48:54,190
Let's thank you for the super chat.

1527
01:48:54,490 --> 01:48:54,650
Thank you.

1528
01:48:54,990 --> 01:48:55,390
Thank you.

1529
01:48:56,270 --> 01:49:01,030
Face the holy mother who had fashioned so cruel and crude a daughter as me.

1530
01:49:03,670 --> 01:49:05,490
After all, it's you that she wants this.

1531
01:49:05,550 --> 01:49:07,790
Oh, she does have mommy issues.

1532
01:49:09,310 --> 01:49:10,570
Hey, we can be good friends.

1533
01:49:10,670 --> 01:49:12,150
We both have mommy issues.

1534
01:49:14,630 --> 01:49:16,450
At least my mom wants me.

1535
01:49:20,190 --> 01:49:22,330
You and I are not the same.

1536
01:49:22,750 --> 01:49:26,090
My mom just went on an eternal slumber, but she wants me.

1537
01:49:31,290 --> 01:49:33,590
After all, it's you that she wants, is it not?

1538
01:49:33,890 --> 01:49:34,610
Oh my gosh.

1539
01:49:34,870 --> 01:49:38,110
And even, I, both mom wants me.

1540
01:49:39,090 --> 01:49:40,950
Don't keep, please.

1541
01:49:43,910 --> 01:49:44,410
Aw.

1542
01:49:47,990 --> 01:49:49,210
Look at that.

1543
01:49:50,810 --> 01:49:53,430
Wow, Hornet, how come you get three moms?

1544
01:49:55,230 --> 01:49:55,770
A door.

1545
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:06,660
Oh, press what?

1546
01:50:06,820 --> 01:50:07,400
It's too late.

1547
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:10,280
Too late.

1548
01:50:10,780 --> 01:50:12,040
I'm here for the moms.

1549
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:18,960
What the fuck is this?

1550
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:22,880
One to wish are waiting.

1551
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:30,780
Better a child's fun.

1552
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:34,280
Mad than... than none.

1553
01:50:41,080 --> 01:50:43,340
From our silk, a child, we're loyal.

1554
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:46,300
How many tries did it take to beat Lace?

1555
01:50:46,780 --> 01:50:49,120
It's just, I- her parries just threw me off.

1556
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:54,220
I felt like she was- she- I felt like this boss definitely does input reading.

1557
01:50:58,120 --> 01:51:02,600
Because like, she knew exactly what- like, like she read my mind.

1558
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:05,200
She know- she knew when and where I was gonna die.

1559
01:51:06,620 --> 01:51:09,040
Or, like, she knew, like, how it's gonna dodge.

1560
01:51:09,140 --> 01:51:10,360
Alright, let's play here.

1561
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:12,440
Oh.

1562
01:51:13,480 --> 01:51:13,960

1575
01:51:32,180 --> 01:51:33,780
How can she die?

1576
01:51:34,140 --> 01:51:35,320

01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:22,480
Bench?

1591
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:23,660
What's the door?

1592
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:25,780
Oh, down below.

1593
01:53:29,220 --> 01:53:30,160
Wait, what's over here?

1594
01:53:34,900 --> 01:53:36,120
God, I don't know.

1595
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:39,960
Oh, the lever I activated.

1596
01:53:41,140 --> 01:53:41,580
Oh!

1597
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:44,460
I thought I activated something.

1598
01:53:44,740 --> 01:53:46,120
The one above me.

1599
01:53:50,380 --> 01:53:52,240
Oh, I didn't realize this was a door.

1600
01:53:52,300 --> 01:53:52,980
Oh, shit!

1601
01:53:53,060 --> 01:53:53,600
Where am I?

1602
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:55,620
Where am I?

1603
01:53:56,620 --> 01:53:57,920
It fell down another hole.

1604
01:53:58,900 --> 01:54:00,160
Wait, where is this?

1605
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:04,520
Oh, it's the terminal!

1606
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:09,160
It's the elevator room.

1607
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:10,400
I found it.

1608
01:54:16,290 --> 01:54:16,790
Yeah.

1609
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:26,060
Okay.

1610
01:54:28,180 --> 01:54:31,620
But at least I only felt different from the other bosses I fought.

1611
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:35,460
Just felt like...

1612
01:54:35,780 --> 01:54:36,160
Okay.

1613
01:54:39,020 --> 01:54:43,500
Like, I felt like I had to, like, I had, she was reading me and I had to read her.

1614
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:46,480
Weaver in eighth part, last of the line.

1615
01:54:46,980 --> 01:54:50,280
Rail with age, tracked and taken in Sansteen waste.

1616
01:54:50,740 --> 01:54:53,600
Seven cursors, nine envos lost attack.

1617
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:58,260
Like, we were just reading each other.

1618
01:54:58,740 --> 01:55:01,140
I was like playing, I felt like I was playing chess with her.

1619
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:06,220
Weaver in quarter part, last of the line.

1620
01:55:07,740 --> 01:55:09,800
tracked and taken beneath the city of seal.

1621
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:12,840
Eight core stairs, 12 envoys lost to task.

1622
01:55:19,300 --> 01:55:23,780
Quick dokey, the saver, use your needle to inject your... Thank you for the super chat.

1623
01:55:23,980 --> 01:55:24,600
Thank you.

1624
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:25,180
Thank you, Lolly.

1625
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:25,860
Thank you.

1626
01:55:28,820 --> 01:55:30,340
I assume I just go up.

1627
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:33,540
It's like a heartbeat.

1628
01:55:42,070 --> 01:55:43,690
That was the widow's cage.

1629
01:55:44,810 --> 01:55:45,250
Oh.

1630
01:55:45,710 --> 01:55:46,190
Oh.

1631
01:55:51,910 --> 01:55:55,190
Oh, wait, are we at the final boss?

1632
01:55:57,170 --> 01:55:59,370
Is there anything here?

1633
01:56:01,710 --> 01:56:02,470
Oh, what's here?

1634
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:06,660
Secret.

1635
01:56:07,780 --> 01:56:08,320
Secret.

1636
01:56:09,080 --> 01:56:10,040
That's what's here.

1637
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:11,660
Oh, it's just silk.

1638
01:56:12,140 --> 01:56:12,800
Okay, that's cool.

1639
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:13,860
Alright.

1640
01:56:14,340 --> 01:56:15,940
Not as cool of a secret.

1641
01:56:17,240 --> 01:56:18,120
Is it really just silk?

1642
01:56:28,660 --> 01:56:29,920
Oh, playing me.

1643
01:56:29,940 --> 01:56:30,260
Music?

1644
01:56:31,040 --> 01:56:31,120
Here?

1645
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:34,220
Here?

1646
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:36,300
Wake,

1647
01:56:41,340 --> 01:56:42,100
wake, wake.

1648
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:43,360
Oh, is this the widow?

1649
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:46,920
Glory to you of the first and the last.

1650
01:56:48,540 --> 01:56:49,840
Devotion to you.

1651
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:52,120
We hear you.

1652
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:54,740
Spin, bind, punish.

1653
01:56:56,020 --> 01:56:57,500
Our light, divine.

1654
01:56:58,540 --> 01:56:59,920
Our mother, true.

1655
01:57:00,660 --> 01:57:02,460
Wake, wake, wake.

1656
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:03,680
Okay, that's the same.

1657
01:57:03,860 --> 01:57:04,900
She's seeing the same thing.

1658
01:57:05,940 --> 01:57:06,920
Oh, it's the widow.

1659
01:57:08,120 --> 01:57:09,420
Too bad she's dead.

1660
01:57:11,660 --> 01:57:12,660
That is open.

1661
01:57:13,580 --> 01:57:13,780
Whoa!

1662
01:57:14,900 --> 01:57:15,800
Oh, is this shortcut?

1663
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:16,700
Oh, it's a shortcut.

1664
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:19,440
Yeah.

1665
01:57:19,900 --> 01:57:20,860
I killed her.

1666
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:22,740
And her stupid bells.

1667
01:57:26,300 --> 01:57:27,180
Oh my god.

1668
01:57:27,200 --> 01:57:28,200

1669
01:57:28,280 --> 01:57:28,540
Oh, wait.

1670
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:29,520

I got so confused.

1682
01:58:49,280 --> 01:58:50,800
Oh my god, I'm so scared.

1683
01:58:54,820 --> 01:58:56,060
I'm so scared.

1684
01:58:57,440 --> 01:58:58,680
I'm just gonna heal just in case.

01:59:10,160 --> 01:59:10,660

01:59:15,980 --> 01:59:16,680
Not the rocks!

1689
01:59:16,820 --> 01:59:18,720
Please don't tell me she can send rocks out!

1690
01:59:19,400 --> 01:59:19,800
Wow!

1691
01:59:23,680 --> 01:59:24,600

Oh, God.

1694
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:30,140
She's gonna start sending rocks out, isn't she?

1695
01:59:33,240 --> 01:59:34,600
Oh my god, fuck!

1696

Hello?

1697
01:59:40,010 --> 01:59:41,210
Oh no, not the spikes.

1698
01:59:43,590 --> 01:59:45,390
I like how she didn't move.

1699
01:59:45,710 --> 01:59:47,610

1707
02:00:02,550 --> 02:00:03,070
No!

1708
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:06,860
She got confused.

1709
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:07,860
Me too.

1710
02:00:08,480 --> 02:00:10,220
I'm also very confused.

1711
02:00:11,700 --> 02:00:12,040
Oh!

1712
02:00:14,300 --> 02:00:15,500
Oh god, I need yourself.

1713
02:00:15,860 --> 02:00:16,420
I need yourself.

1714
02:00:17,960 --> 02:00:18,920
Oh, nice.

1715
02:00:19,580 --> 02:00:21,740
Oh, she does three damage?

1716
02:00:28,980 --> 02:00:29,860
That's fine.

1717
02:00:30,660 --> 02:00:31,740
Oh, this is not fine.

1718
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:40,820
Oh god, there's so much.

1719
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:41,240
Stop!

1720
02:00:45,560 --> 02:00:46,560
Oh my god.

1721
02:01:04,540 --> 02:01:05,620
That's secure.

1722
02:01:05,740 --> 02:01:06,000
Right?

1723
02:01:06,440 --> 02:01:09,380
Your daughter was harder than you.

1724
02:01:09,780 --> 02:01:11,100
That's right.

1725
02:01:12,820 --> 02:01:16,600
Sam the retired old woman.

1726
02:01:18,740 --> 02:01:21,120
And Sam the retired granny.

1727
02:01:21,820 --> 02:01:24,900
I struggled harder than your fucking daughter.

1728
02:01:25,620 --> 02:01:28,000
And she's just made a silk.

1729
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:34,080
How did Lace?

1730
02:01:34,460 --> 02:01:35,720
Because she was impoverished.

1731
02:01:35,740 --> 02:01:43,020
reading she knew when i was gonna die she had my 20-year plan ready

1732
02:01:47,260 --> 02:01:58,720
she knew i was gonna graduate she knew when she knew which retirement home i was gonna go to she she knew in everything

1733
02:02:04,740 --> 02:02:10,340
all right yay i did it i saved the world I did it, everyone.

1734
02:02:10,580 --> 02:02:12,500
I saved... I saved Farloom!

1735
02:02:14,940 --> 02:02:15,620
Yay!

1736
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:19,560
Oh my god, and I get six legs?

1737
02:02:19,820 --> 02:02:20,720
Let's go.

1738
02:02:21,480 --> 02:02:24,520
How is getting six legs a bad ending?

1739
02:02:25,780 --> 02:02:27,600
More hands to hold swords.

1740
02:02:28,020 --> 02:02:29,420
More hands to hold needles.

1741
02:02:30,900 --> 02:02:33,040
You met under new management?

1742
02:02:33,380 --> 02:02:34,540
Even better!

1743
02:02:35,040 --> 02:02:35,640
Finally!

1744
02:02:35,880 --> 02:02:37,060
I can be queen!

1745
02:02:38,740 --> 02:02:41,820
That means I got pro- How is that bad ending?

1746
02:02:42,160 --> 02:02:43,520
I got promoted.

1747
02:02:44,220 --> 02:02:44,640
I-

1748
02:02:48,720 --> 02:02:50,980
Now I'm literally royalty.

1749
02:02:53,200 --> 02:02:53,540
Yay!

1750
02:02:53,820 --> 02:02:54,980
I got promoted.

1751
02:02:56,940 --> 02:02:58,400
I see that as a win.

1752
02:02:58,740 --> 02:03:00,640
I don't understand how that could be a bad ending.

1753
02:03:09,620 --> 02:03:10,860
Congrats for the bad ending.

1754
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:11,200
ending.

1755
02:03:11,480 --> 02:03:12,940
Nero, thank you, thank you.

1756
02:03:12,940 --> 02:03:13,780
Thank you.

1757
02:03:13,820 --> 02:03:14,700
It's crazy.

1758
02:03:14,980 --> 02:03:17,980
The Grat- Silk Grandma was actually easier than Lace.

1759
02:03:18,720 --> 02:03:25,860
All these bosses, okay, the endgame bosses are so much easier than the fucking the journey to get there.

1760
02:03:26,900 --> 02:03:29,260
Never mind, you deserve this ending.

1761
02:03:29,700 --> 02:03:31,420
But Largus, thank you for the super chat.

1762
02:03:31,480 --> 02:03:32,120

Thank you.

02:03:35,360 --> 02:03:37,760
True ending run when.

1768
02:04:02,150 --> 02:04:03,210

1771
02:05:06,570 --> 02:05:08,810
I do not need all of the fleas.

1772
02:05:09,150 --> 02:05:11,810
I feel like a lot of people still don't really know what you need for it.

1773
02:05:11,890 --> 02:05:12,330
Oh hey!

1774
02:05:13,430 --> 02:05:14,210
You made it!

1775
02:05:15,550 --> 02:05:15,930
The little...

1776
02:05:15,930 --> 02:05:16,390
Sharma!

1777
02:05:17,330 --> 02:05:17,430
Hmm?

1778
02:05:17,810 --> 02:05:18,550
Oh hi there!

1779
02:05:18,950 --> 02:05:20,730
I was hoping when we hear, Red Maiden.

1780
02:05:21,310 --> 02:05:23,470
Rising at last to the heights of the shadow.

1781
02:05:23,970 --> 02:05:25,750
And we want so many of you did it!

1782
02:05:25,810 --> 02:05:26,110
You made it!

1783
02:05:26,130 --> 02:05:58,150

1784
02:05:58,650 --> 02:06:01,830
And my brothers and sisters not yet earned their holy reward?

1785
02:06:02,550 --> 02:06:02,930
This time.

1786
02:06:04,610 --> 02:06:10,950

Be quiet!

1789
02:06:13,690 --> 02:06:15,410
I am here for Shurma!

1790
02:06:16,470 --> 02:06:19,230
Don't change her voice with your moaning!

1791
02:06:21,050 --> 02:06:23,510
All your work and look they keep arriving.

1792
02:06:24,050 --> 02:06:25,750
It's bugs a plenty up here now.

1793
02:06:26,130 --> 02:06:57,050

02:06:57,150 --> 02:07:00,130

1795
02:07:05,450 --> 02:07:07,610
Okay, you out 22 fleas.

1796
02:07:07,750 --> 02:07:09,450
How many fleas have I even saved?

1797
02:07:09,690 --> 02:07:11,510
Oh, hunt club choir bugs.

1798
02:07:11,790 --> 02:07:13,170
Oh, okay, we gotta grab that.

1799
02:07:13,670 --> 02:07:14,950
Whose quest was this?

1800
02:07:17,210 --> 02:07:19,150
I don't even know when I...

1801
02:07:19,150 --> 02:07:20,950
I don't even know when I got those.

1802
02:07:26,930 --> 02:07:27,330
Alright.

1803
02:07:29,870 --> 02:07:32,010
Get to the last place.

1804
02:07:32,610 --> 02:07:33,670
He is optional.

1805
02:07:33,990 --> 02:07:35,090
Okay, that's good to know.

1806
02:07:35,650 --> 02:07:35,790
Ow.

1807
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:36,850
I forgot about this.

1808
02:07:42,860 --> 02:07:43,440
All right.

1809
02:07:43,900 --> 02:07:46,120
We'll see how many quests we can... wishes we can do.

1810
02:07:48,120 --> 02:07:48,740
All right, here.

1811
02:07:52,920 --> 02:07:54,040
Are you the choir?

1812
02:07:54,920 --> 02:07:56,600
Wait, are these choir bugs?

1813
02:07:56,780 --> 02:07:57,440
I can't tell.

1814
02:08:00,360 --> 02:08:02,220
I don't know which ones are the choir.

1815
02:08:03,140 --> 02:08:03,620
These.

1816
02:08:06,320 --> 02:08:06,880
Requireable.

1817
02:08:10,080 --> 02:08:10,980
What do they look like?

1818
02:08:13,500 --> 02:08:15,260
Grab this stuff.

1819
02:08:24,530 --> 02:08:26,670
What do they look like again?

1820
02:08:26,890 --> 02:08:28,210
Oh, is it these guys?

1821
02:08:31,070 --> 02:08:31,630
No.

1822
02:08:32,190 --> 02:08:32,890
Or is it them?

1823
02:08:34,410 --> 02:08:35,770
Oh my god.

1824
02:08:39,890 --> 02:08:40,950
Oh, there he is.

1825
02:08:41,070 --> 02:08:42,470
Okay, this is what he looks like.

1826
02:08:42,570 --> 02:08:43,370
Okay, choir club.

1827
02:08:44,070 --> 02:08:44,890
Oh, here he is.

1828
02:08:46,110 --> 02:08:46,510
Nice.

1829
02:08:46,790 --> 02:08:47,110
All right.

1830
02:08:47,410 --> 02:08:48,150
Where's your body?

1831
02:08:48,750 --> 02:08:49,290
There you go.

1832
02:08:50,190 --> 02:08:51,230
Okay, I just gotta reset.

1833
02:08:55,570 --> 02:08:57,270
Wait, oh my, okay.

1834
02:08:57,450 --> 02:08:58,850
Wait, why are you naked?

1835
02:08:59,390 --> 02:09:00,950
He had clothes under there.

1836
02:09:01,570 --> 02:09:02,090
What the fuck?

1837
02:09:02,250 --> 02:09:03,370
You had nothing underneath?

1838
02:09:07,450 --> 02:09:08,250
Holy shit.

1839
02:09:09,910 --> 02:09:12,070
What are these guys considered wise?

1840
02:09:14,030 --> 02:09:14,670
No, they're not.

1841
02:09:15,650 --> 02:09:16,690
Don't laugh at him.

1842
02:09:17,050 --> 02:09:18,650
He just wants to be free.

1843
02:09:19,130 --> 02:09:20,950
He spent so long journey.

1844
02:09:21,130 --> 02:09:22,130
This is his reward.

1845
02:09:22,690 --> 02:09:23,450
His reward?

1846
02:09:24,130 --> 02:09:25,410
We're making it to Citadel.

1847
02:09:25,930 --> 02:09:27,070
He doesn't have to wear pants.

1848
02:09:27,230 --> 02:09:28,930
He doesn't have to wear clothes anymore.

1849
02:09:29,050 --> 02:09:30,510
He gets to be naked and free.

1850
02:09:33,310 --> 02:09:34,790
Alright, we just gotta kill that one guy.

1851
02:09:36,910 --> 02:09:36,990
Hello.

1852
02:09:38,330 --> 02:09:39,370
Wait, let me kill him.

1853
02:09:39,470 --> 02:09:40,150
first here.

1854
02:09:45,690 --> 02:09:47,310
I'm coming for you!

1855
02:09:47,890 --> 02:09:49,670
I'm coming for you!

1856
02:09:49,850 --> 02:09:51,070
Get over here!

1857
02:09:54,010 --> 02:09:54,730
Nice.

1858
02:09:55,870 --> 02:09:57,830
Alright, there's one over here, too.

1859
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:03,140
Oh, shit.

1860
02:10:03,440 --> 02:10:04,480
Are you fucking kidding?

1861
02:10:04,580 --> 02:10:05,980
Okay, that's not fair.

1862
02:10:08,840 --> 02:10:11,000
I think she's also...

1863
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:12,200
I can also...

1864
02:10:12,500 --> 02:10:13,520
take her clothes too.

1865
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:14,920
What does she look under there?

1866
02:10:15,140 --> 02:10:16,460
Oh my gosh, they're all naked.

1867
02:10:17,100 --> 02:10:19,320
No wonder everybody wanted to make the pilgrimage.

1868
02:10:20,560 --> 02:10:21,820
They all want to be naked.

1869
02:10:23,120 --> 02:10:24,960
Okay, I can't take his clothes.

1870
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:27,620
Not the best spot.

1871
02:10:27,680 --> 02:10:28,720
I don't even know where to farm.

1872
02:10:29,360 --> 02:10:31,080
I just randomly went here.

1873
02:10:34,180 --> 02:10:35,180
Oh, here!

1874
02:10:36,080 --> 02:10:37,740
This is a farm spot.

1875
02:10:39,360 --> 02:10:39,800
Alright.

1876
02:10:40,700 --> 02:10:41,740
Give me your clothes.

1877
02:10:43,620 --> 02:10:43,840
Nice.

1878
02:10:43,860 --> 02:10:47,020
Oh, I took all his clothes.

1879
02:10:52,300 --> 02:10:53,900
Yeah, we're being so faithful.

1880
02:10:54,580 --> 02:10:55,660
You will be free.

1881
02:11:04,430 --> 02:11:05,190
Wake up!

1882
02:11:08,230 --> 02:11:09,650
Can't sleep on your job.

1883
02:11:09,910 --> 02:11:11,290
No slacking allowed.

1884
02:11:12,350 --> 02:11:12,710
Alright.

1885
02:11:14,830 --> 02:11:15,670
Or a chamber.

1886
02:11:18,610 --> 02:11:18,950
Okay.

1887
02:11:20,650 --> 02:11:22,830
I'm just killing him for money, too.

1888
02:11:24,270 --> 02:11:26,190
Let him sleep.

1889
02:11:26,490 --> 02:11:29,730
If I have to work, he has to work, guys.

1890
02:11:33,420 --> 02:11:35,840
It's simply equality.

1891
02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:41,700
Yoink, my clothes now.

1892
02:11:45,560 --> 02:11:47,580
Actually, I'll go down here.

1893
02:11:51,480 --> 02:11:52,620
Oh, nice.

1894
02:11:54,100 --> 02:11:54,360
Yoink.

1895
02:11:55,580 --> 02:11:56,320
Fire cloak.

1896
02:11:57,940 --> 02:11:58,140
Joink.

1897
02:11:59,540 --> 02:11:59,800
All right.

1898
02:12:00,160 --> 02:12:00,820
That is...

1899
02:12:00,820 --> 02:12:01,540
We're almost out.

1900
02:12:01,820 --> 02:12:02,580
We're almost...

1901
02:12:03,400 --> 02:12:05,820
We almost have all the clothes.

1902
02:12:09,900 --> 02:12:12,260
God, it's so unlucky that I had to fall into the snow.

1903
02:12:12,720 --> 02:12:15,260
How am I supposed to take his clothes now?

1904
02:12:15,860 --> 02:12:17,720
How will he be free?

1905
02:12:18,660 --> 02:12:20,620
Free from the restraint of clothing.

1906
02:12:25,660 --> 02:12:26,420
Oops.

1907
02:12:32,360 --> 02:12:33,020
Alright, reset.

1908
02:12:34,280 --> 02:12:36,100
I keep impelling him.

1909
02:12:36,400 --> 02:12:38,800
It's his own fucked up groundhog day.

1910
02:12:47,940 --> 02:12:49,760
This is my farm spot.

1911
02:12:52,160 --> 02:12:52,920
Ow.

1912
02:12:53,940 --> 02:12:55,200
Locked my head accidentally.

1913
02:12:59,340 --> 02:13:01,500
Alright, I just gotta get him out of here.

1914
02:13:02,660 --> 02:13:03,460
It's time!

1915
02:13:03,840 --> 02:13:04,540
Ring, ring, ring!

1916
02:13:06,260 --> 02:13:36,430

1917
02:13:42,820 --> 02:13:43,300
What?

1918
02:13:43,780 --> 02:13:44,600
Okay, I was gonna say.

1919
02:13:45,200 --> 02:13:47,020
How did she interrupted my attack?

1920
02:13:48,860 --> 02:13:50,220
I should be close, right?

1921
02:13:52,120 --> 02:13:53,520
How many more do I have?

1922
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:55,400
Oh, nice.

1923
02:13:55,520 --> 02:13:56,120
I got it.

1924
02:13:56,760 --> 02:13:58,440
Alright, back I go.

1925
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:02,520
Whee!

1926
02:14:06,100 --> 02:14:11,500
It's a little weird that the grandpa wants pre-worn cloaks.

1927
02:14:12,140 --> 02:14:13,620
I don't know what he's gonna do with them.

1928
02:14:14,040 --> 02:14:16,200
It is a little weird, but I don't ask questions.

1929
02:14:18,600 --> 02:14:20,100
I'm just here for Act 3.

1930
02:14:24,340 --> 02:14:26,080
What is the grandpa gonna do with that?

1931
02:14:31,600 --> 02:14:33,820
Blow the pilgrims that aren't dead.

1932
02:14:35,440 --> 02:14:39,880
Sir, I've opened the way above these halls and bested a white knight that stood as guardian.

1933
02:14:40,820 --> 02:14:44,700
Cal the monarch, she claimed herself at the end, and as she suggested, it's true.

1934
02:14:45,100 --> 02:14:47,420
A being born purely from silk woven tight.

1935
02:14:48,760 --> 02:14:49,600
feet is possible.

1936
02:14:50,280 --> 02:14:55,080
I've seen life woven from silk before, but tiny, transient, never like this.

1937
02:14:55,880 --> 02:14:58,700
Aye, bell-ringer, you slain a marvel indeed.

1938
02:14:59,240 --> 02:15:01,060
Well, flogged, marveled at least.

1939
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:05,580
Wanted to keep far from she was, at least for us mortal sorts.

1940
02:15:05,980 --> 02:15:07,980
Look of a child and mind to match.

1941
02:15:08,380 --> 02:15:12,820
For hers been up wondering the citadel longer and most, even with long silence.

1942
02:15:13,340 --> 02:15:15,060
Wait for you, keep around, it's true.

1943
02:15:15,640 --> 02:15:19,640
Might as see herself this place protector, cleaving clean as quiet she did.

1944
02:15:21,480 --> 02:15:22,480
Of course.

1945
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:24,300
Quiet moment.

1946
02:15:24,720 --> 02:15:27,400
Most crossing her path found a painful end from her pin.

1947
02:15:28,100 --> 02:15:29,800
I'd be saying thanks for the slaying.

1948
02:15:30,160 --> 02:15:32,280
With all the other husks now awoke in the range.

1949
02:15:32,740 --> 02:15:34,300
A bug's chance ain't grown by much.

1950
02:15:34,540 --> 02:15:36,120
Wait, whose quest was it?

1951
02:15:36,940 --> 02:15:37,560
Oh, there you go.

1952
02:15:37,680 --> 02:15:38,160
Fire cloak.

1953
02:15:39,880 --> 02:15:40,140
Yay!

1954
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:41,520
Wish granted.

1955
02:15:44,020 --> 02:15:44,980
Okay, I got money.

1956
02:15:46,780 --> 02:15:47,280
Alright.

1957
02:15:48,740 --> 02:15:50,140
I don't have a...

1958
02:15:50,140 --> 02:15:51,760
Oh, is that so dear?

1959
02:15:51,880 --> 02:15:52,500
How old you are?

1960
02:15:52,880 --> 02:15:53,580
You should know, though.

1961
02:15:53,760 --> 02:15:56,200
This old pilgrim has their sights cleanly trained on you.

1962
02:15:56,560 --> 02:15:58,000
Nothing gets old Jubalaya.

1963
02:16:02,100 --> 02:16:02,980
Who's sleeping?

1964
02:16:03,860 --> 02:16:04,740
I just hear that.

1965
02:16:07,340 --> 02:16:08,100
Oh, hey!

1966
02:16:08,320 --> 02:16:08,940
It's you!

1967
02:16:12,740 --> 02:16:14,340
It's Garmon and Zaza!

1968
02:16:15,240 --> 02:16:16,820
Very meaning again, Sir Knight.

1969
02:16:17,160 --> 02:16:19,560
I see this bell has drawn you two towards his safety.

1970
02:16:19,700 --> 02:16:20,160
I'm sorry.

1971
02:16:20,500 --> 02:16:21,700
Who would have guessed, sister?

1972
02:16:22,100 --> 02:16:25,460
A safe corner hidden so high that top firelooms, curses, clown.

1973
02:16:26,240 --> 02:16:32,540
Our fair village may have fallen, but for these fellows, it is sacred if you are honored charges us to keep them safe.

1974
02:16:32,860 --> 02:16:34,460
Our hoaryland shall raise for them.

1975
02:16:34,640 --> 02:16:36,000
After some rest, of course.

1976
02:16:36,720 --> 02:16:38,200
Hold fast your new charge, Garmin.

1977
02:16:38,520 --> 02:16:43,180
See, these both survive, and know I am in time near to get down this curse at its core.

1978
02:16:43,940 --> 02:16:45,700
There's Garmin and Zaza!

1979
02:16:46,620 --> 02:16:48,460
Alright, so what do we have?

1980
02:16:48,540 --> 02:17:51,020
Oh, wait, we should actually return this first how many wishes am i missing oh talk to sherma for another wish all right sherma what do you want this place is holy yes by way of the suffering our fellow pilgrims so many are hurt and exhausted your doubts and worries will not heal them little one if you had aid your fellow you can start by dressing your wounds the simple rags found around the settlement will do for bandages oh that's an excellent idea red maiden normally i think a song with a fist but yes more direct action is certainly needed and a citadel itself shall provide the materials praise me to this whole use of holy lands wait what she's not gonna give you a quest you're not brothers and sisters and we work hard and keep our faith the city citadel will provide for us i have no doubt okay you mean i will provide for you guys who is the one that's paying for your citadel's taxes right now Oh,

02:17:51,240 --> 02:17:51,680
gotta leave.

1982
02:17:51,800 --> 02:17:54,540
I'm literally paying for, like, the entire citadel.

1983
02:18:01,600 --> 02:18:02,240
The long one.

1984
02:18:02,380 --> 02:18:02,880
This guy?

1985
02:18:03,960 --> 02:18:05,120
You say, close sister.

1986
02:18:05,360 --> 02:18:07,540
Then husband crawling with husk.

1987
02:18:07,960 --> 02:18:10,300
Or you only bring death, pointed, and painful.

1988
02:18:11,340 --> 02:18:12,800
She doesn't know.

1989
02:18:13,580 --> 02:18:14,680
What do you mean?

1990
02:18:15,060 --> 02:18:17,020
This wishboy was, like, we need $400.

1991
02:18:17,540 --> 02:18:22,880
Oh, if only someone could give these poor pilgrims $400.

1992
02:18:24,440 --> 02:18:25,320
If only.

1993
02:18:25,340 --> 02:18:26,040
and it was me.

1994
02:18:26,280 --> 02:18:26,620
It was me.

1995
02:18:26,760 --> 02:18:29,360
I was the one that gave them $400.

1996
02:18:39,540 --> 02:18:45,240
There could... Anyone else could have given them $400, but they waited for me.

1997
02:18:51,620 --> 02:18:54,680
It wasn't a novice donation.

1998
02:18:55,220 --> 02:18:57,100
It could have been anyone.

1999
02:18:59,420 --> 02:19:04,500
And they're like, yay, praise the Citadel for providing for us.

2000
02:19:13,400 --> 02:19:15,280
Yay, I wish granted.

2001
02:19:18,420 --> 02:19:18,460
Oh.

2002
02:19:21,700 --> 02:19:22,020
Nice.

2003
02:19:22,300 --> 02:19:22,840
New mask.

2004
02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:26,120
Oh, look at that.

2005
02:19:26,680 --> 02:19:28,000
Another $400.

2006
02:19:28,540 --> 02:19:29,280
There you go.

2007
02:19:30,460 --> 02:19:31,820
Wish granted.

2008
02:19:33,020 --> 02:19:35,120
I don't even know how many wishes I've done.

2009
02:19:35,920 --> 02:19:38,080
I don't think any one of us have been keeping track.

2010
02:19:40,100 --> 02:19:41,760
Yeah, it doesn't even tell me.

2011
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:42,460
Oh, wait, there he goes.

2012
02:19:42,560 --> 02:19:43,080
All right, let's count.

2013
02:19:43,180 --> 02:19:44,400
How many wishes do I need?

2014
02:19:45,140 --> 02:19:59,960
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.

I've done 31.

2016
02:20:04,750 --> 02:20:05,570
All right.

2017
02:20:07,350 --> 02:20:08,870
How to open the Bellheart's house?

2018
02:20:08,970 --> 02:20:10,090

Five people live here.

02:25:24,770 --> 02:25:25,210

Can I have my house now?

2071
02:25:30,690 --> 02:25:33,750
Miss Traveler, thank you to your valiant contributions.

2072
02:25:34,210 --> 02:25:36,690
Our little town's starting to feel like it's old self again.

2073
02:25:36,990 --> 02:25:39,810
Homes have been hoisted and there's shiny spires.

2074
02:25:40,450 --> 02:25:41,770
Hasina changes myself, Pavel.

2075
02:25:42,290 --> 02:25:45,010
This place didn't hear my contributions have not been in vain.

2076
02:25:45,310 --> 02:25:47,870
Thank God they didn't waste my money on some...

2077
02:25:48,930 --> 02:26:20,510
meaningless thing like pokemon cards thank god i'm so happy they didn't embezzle my money and indeed your generosity is a guide for others we've only one thing now solely missing bugs what is a town about its residents age scarcity deadly thread the heart is beset by endless ills now there's just us remaining few as you met in recognition of your noble efforts and That's one step to solving the problem.

2078
02:26:20,830 --> 02:26:22,770
I decree a grand gift should be given.

2079
02:26:23,130 --> 02:26:23,550
A bell home.

2080
02:26:23,810 --> 02:26:24,770
Oh my God.

2081
02:26:25,010 --> 02:26:26,050
A free house.

2082
02:26:26,570 --> 02:26:27,410
I don't have to.

2083
02:26:27,530 --> 02:26:28,070
Oh my God.

2084
02:26:28,150 --> 02:26:30,310
I hope there's like no.

2085
02:26:32,610 --> 02:26:34,050
No red flags with it.

2086
02:26:34,130 --> 02:26:35,710
Do I have to pay the property tax?

2087
02:26:36,070 --> 02:26:44,030
I read that like if you're gifted a mansion, it's easier to sell than to live in it because of property taxes.

2088
02:26:44,890 --> 02:26:48,850
And so I hope there's no like exception with exceptions.

2089
02:26:48,930 --> 02:27:20,130
here yeah quote-unquote free you have to pay like all the taxes for it a place to reflect a bed to lay in it's king up there at the top beside our gold pin master to me again I have no plans to settle Pavel but for now my task in Parfarlum remains and while it does a resume prove useful of course of course Your fortitude impressed us all.

2090
02:27:20,410 --> 02:27:21,670
I have trouble ever descends on you.

2091
02:27:21,930 --> 02:27:23,670
It surely won't hurt to have a resident warrior.

2092
02:27:23,910 --> 02:27:24,630
No sack now.

2093
02:27:24,930 --> 02:27:25,310
Yay!

2094
02:27:25,790 --> 02:27:27,310
I have a house now.

2095
02:27:27,950 --> 02:27:30,790
And I have to pay a 70% property tax.

2096
02:27:30,870 --> 02:27:32,330
Even though I don't live here.

2097
02:27:33,010 --> 02:27:33,450
Yay!

2098
02:27:38,650 --> 02:27:41,410

2107
02:28:30,090 --> 02:28:30,990
There's no spa.

2108
02:28:31,050 --> 02:28:31,950

02:29:12,160 --> 02:29:13,980
Yeah, with strings attached.

2121
02:29:18,990 --> 02:29:20,770
There's strings attached to it.

2122
02:29:26,020 --> 02:29:27,940
Okay, the fleas are down here.

02:31:36,040 --> 02:31:37,680
And a new high spot for a rest.

2157
02:31:37,940 --> 02:31:40,880
Upon the doorstep of that mighty Citadel, no less.

2158
02:31:40,880 --> 02:31:54,540
You're not a Yeah, I think Hornet's a flea person I won't be surprised He seems like a flea person What's the What's the buggy equivalent of a cat in this game?

2159
02:31:56,220 --> 02:32:01,020
Chat Are you a Are you a flea person?

02:32:02,200 --> 02:32:03,540
Or a worm person?

Oh, are you a flea person or a grub person?

2162
02:32:07,180 --> 02:32:09,120
Oh yeah, the grubs are cats!

2163
02:32:09,660 --> 02:32:12,440
The grubs are cats and the fleas are dogs.

2164
02:32:15,280 --> 02:32:23,660
Maybe I should ask, maybe I should change, ask, um, ask the person that made Doki Bug to change it into a flea.

2165
02:32:24,520 --> 02:32:27,740
It's fortunate that all your companions survive the trek, the master.

2166
02:32:28,220 --> 02:32:30,460
Oh, I thought I said it is, okay, I thought I said it is unfortunate.

2167
02:32:30,780 --> 02:32:39,400
It's fortunate that the howling rise beside and the tangled wood before it have both cleaned the lives of countless bugs.

2168
02:32:40,580 --> 02:32:40,860
Indeed.

2169
02:32:40,880 --> 02:33:08,700

Don't you hate it when you give someone a gift and they start levitating?

2171
02:33:18,100 --> 02:33:23,020
Here we shall remain for a time, assorted, and pray that more lost fleas find a way to us.

Alright, how many more lost fleas do I have to find?

Grand Bellway...

02:34:35,890 --> 02:34:38,170
I don't even know how many fleas I've saved.

2197
02:34:38,850 --> 02:34:40,390
I feel like I've saved so many.

2198
02:34:40,570 --> 02:34:41,390
I've lost count.

2199
02:34:44,710 --> 02:34:45,410

02:34:52,850 --> 02:34:55,050
I went to Bellheart to look at my new home.

2206
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:00,300

2207
02:35:04,190 --> 02:35:05,830

Nothing else here?

2267
02:39:04,850 --> 02:39:06,430
I was glad there was more stuff.

2268
02:39:11,100 --> 02:39:11,780
Oh, did I get...

2269
02:39:11,780 --> 02:39:12,820

Oh, it did!

2271
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:16,860

Oh, they're all dead.

2278
02:39:31,360 --> 02:39:32,080
I forgot.

2279
02:39:33,620 --> 02:39:34,700
They're all dead.

2280
02:39:35,340 --> 02:39:35,540
Oh, wait.

2281
02:39:35,560 --> 02:39:35,980
I should have...

2282
02:39:36,060 --> 02:39:37,120
kill them for money more.

2283
02:39:41,370 --> 02:39:41,730
Alright.

2284
02:39:48,040 --> 02:39:49,680
And this way.

2285
02:39:52,120 --> 02:39:52,340

2287
02:39:58,020 --> 02:39:59,500

2288
02:40:02,220 --> 02:40:02,600
Wee!

2289
02:40:05,940 --> 02:40:08,100
Alright, Shurama should be here.

2290
02:40:10,320 --> 02:40:10,660

2291
02:40:12,300 --> 02:40:13,500

2297
02:41:01,140 --> 02:41:01,480
Oh hey.

2298
02:41:02,720 --> 02:41:03,380
Oh there it is.

2299
02:41:04,640 --> 02:41:06,240
Oh I got your scent.

2300
02:41:10,780 --> 02:41:10,780
Bye.

2301
02:41:11,840 --> 02:41:12,920
Oh shit.

2302
02:41:13,400 --> 02:41:13,880
Red explodes.

2303
02:41:17,240 --> 02:41:18,800
I know the smell.

2304
02:41:19,780 --> 02:41:22,400
I know the smell of Sherma and it's not creepy.

2305
02:41:23,840 --> 02:41:25,420
I'm just Doing my job.

2306
02:41:28,700 --> 02:41:29,240
This way.

2307
02:41:32,980 --> 02:41:34,620
Look, I was just really worried for her.

2308
02:41:34,760 --> 02:41:36,820
So I memorized what she smelled like.

2309
02:41:40,210 --> 02:41:42,130
I was worried for her life.

2310
02:41:44,670 --> 02:41:46,210
I read her my maiden.

2311
02:41:46,530 --> 02:41:47,450
Have no fear.

2312
02:41:47,950 --> 02:41:48,910
This only eye.

2313
02:41:49,210 --> 02:41:49,890
Sure, ma.

2314
02:41:50,350 --> 02:41:51,730
I found healing supplies.

2315
02:41:52,090 --> 02:41:53,750
But on the way back collapsed.

2316
02:41:54,090 --> 02:41:55,650
And heard moaning from the dark.

2317
02:41:55,970 --> 02:41:57,410
Oh, how thankful I am to see.

2318
02:41:57,430 --> 02:42:00,250
Don't worry, hold your gratitude, little one.

2319
02:42:00,330 --> 02:42:01,390
The dead are stirring.

2320
02:42:02,310 --> 02:42:03,030
I got this.

2321
02:42:05,630 --> 02:42:06,870
Never go full silk.

2322
02:42:09,930 --> 02:42:10,210
You know what?

2323
02:42:10,210 --> 02:42:12,510
Oh, there you go.

2324
02:42:13,130 --> 02:42:14,350
This is what I'm doing with that guy.

2325
02:42:16,010 --> 02:42:16,970
These guys are annoying.

2326
02:42:26,270 --> 02:42:26,710
Easy.

2327
02:42:27,750 --> 02:42:58,030
I'm a hero now about those taxes that I have to pay for the citadel can I get a tax cut after that I should get tax cuts after that all right maiden sorry to alert you in such danger and those poor bugs bewitched by the thread no shins could possibly warn such a fate your pity is not misplaced but better suited for another time for now you should look to your own care Oh,

2328
02:42:58,170 --> 02:43:01,710
yes, I should get those healing supplies back to the pilgrims on the above.

2329
02:43:02,090 --> 02:43:04,390
My brother and sister have waited long enough.

2330
02:43:05,050 --> 02:43:05,110
Yeah.

2331
02:43:10,660 --> 02:43:11,540
All right.

2332
02:43:12,660 --> 02:43:14,060
Wait, was Tema here?

2333
02:43:16,640 --> 02:43:17,660
Did I miss it?

2334
02:43:17,740 --> 02:43:20,640
Oh, yeah, I first tried it.

2335
02:43:21,060 --> 02:43:22,080
Zero damage.

2336
02:43:27,360 --> 02:43:32,740
So because, you know, Not only did I first try it, but I did no damage.

2337
02:43:32,900 --> 02:43:34,600
I should be allowed to pick the shoe.

2338
02:43:40,780 --> 02:43:43,280
Can you safely make your way back to the settlement, little one?

2339
02:43:43,500 --> 02:43:45,520
I could escort you if you need be.

2340
02:43:45,900 --> 02:43:47,020
Oh, yes, I am.

2341
02:43:52,020 --> 02:43:52,640
Oh, no.

2342
02:43:52,880 --> 02:43:56,280
I lay no more of my troubles upon you, Red Maiden.

2343
02:43:56,780 --> 02:43:59,600
The way it cleared, I can return under my own guidance.

2344
02:44:00,260 --> 02:44:02,040
After all, what's another pilgrimage, eh?

2345
02:44:02,260 --> 02:44:02,680
Uh-huh.

2346
02:44:03,920 --> 02:44:05,940
Oh, and I found something for you as well.

2347
02:44:06,200 --> 02:44:08,840
I found it buried amongst the broken relics down there in the darkness.

2348
02:44:09,060 --> 02:44:10,420
Glowing with a pale light.

2349
02:44:10,700 --> 02:44:12,260
It's an odd-looking thing.

2350
02:44:12,560 --> 02:44:14,020
Not exactly holy-seeming.

2351
02:44:14,120 --> 02:44:16,200
I would be honored you accepted it all the same.

2352
02:44:18,320 --> 02:44:20,730
I also first tried the final boss, too.

2353
02:44:22,440 --> 02:44:25,560
But I feel like she wasn't hard, though.

2354
02:44:26,040 --> 02:44:29,280
Compared to Lace, Lace was the complicated, the...

2355
02:44:29,280 --> 02:44:30,240
Was the difficult one.

2356
02:44:31,200 --> 02:44:32,280
Lace, you know...

2357
02:44:33,840 --> 02:44:40,340
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2358
02:44:40,480 --> 02:44:41,600
She's crying.

2359
02:44:44,620 --> 02:44:46,000
Sad song.

2360
02:44:46,860 --> 02:44:47,580
Sad Serba.

2361
02:44:48,680 --> 02:44:49,500
Yeah, that's right.

2362
02:44:49,600 --> 02:44:50,940
Keep singing, terrifying.

2363
02:44:51,420 --> 02:44:53,700
Keep singing through the tears.

2364
02:44:54,200 --> 02:44:55,120
I like it.

2365
02:44:57,060 --> 02:44:57,940
She's here.

2366
02:45:01,940 --> 02:45:02,960
Hi, Redo.

2367
02:45:08,820 --> 02:45:10,940
Keep singing.

2368
02:45:12,160 --> 02:45:14,320
I'll let you know when I'm done, Sherma.

2369
02:45:15,240 --> 02:45:18,020
This rings my heart.

2370
02:45:23,480 --> 02:45:26,780
Don't bully it.

2371
02:45:27,360 --> 02:45:30,240
I have so much silk, Sherma.

2372
02:45:34,800 --> 02:45:35,600
Stop!

2373
02:45:36,520 --> 02:45:38,160
Let him stop!

2374
02:45:43,320 --> 02:45:44,120
Yes,

2375
02:45:47,720 --> 02:45:48,140
more.

2376
02:45:49,380 --> 02:45:49,800
More!

2377
02:45:51,380 --> 02:45:51,460
Oh!

2378
02:45:52,760 --> 02:45:53,440
Alright.

2379
02:45:54,040 --> 02:45:55,600
Guess that's enough singing, Sherma.

2380
02:45:55,760 --> 02:45:56,300
You're lucky.

2381
02:45:56,800 --> 02:45:59,280
You're lucky I have limited silk.

2382
02:46:01,560 --> 02:46:03,820
I would have made you kept going.

2383
02:46:03,840 --> 02:46:06,600
I want more.

2384
02:46:07,120 --> 02:46:08,200
I'm greedy.

2385
02:46:09,260 --> 02:46:13,560
This is the worst thing you've done on stream so far.

2386
02:46:30,220 --> 02:46:35,410
Alright, this way.

2387
02:46:37,990 --> 02:46:39,850
Toki, please.

2388
02:46:42,810 --> 02:46:43,570
Alright.

2389
02:46:51,960 --> 02:46:53,040
Where do I have to go now?

2390
02:47:00,750 --> 02:47:01,550
Let's see.

2391
02:47:02,410 --> 02:47:03,710
Guys, where do we have to go now?

2392
02:47:03,870 --> 02:47:04,450
I'm a lost.

2393
02:47:04,990 --> 02:47:05,390
I'm a...

2394
02:47:05,390 --> 02:47:05,730
Ow!

2395
02:47:06,150 --> 02:47:06,850
What the fuck?

2396
02:47:06,990 --> 02:47:08,310
He's like, This is for sure, Mom!

2397
02:47:13,440 --> 02:47:14,440
Oh yeah, you're right.

2398
02:47:14,620 --> 02:47:15,280
I almost forgot.

2399
02:47:15,580 --> 02:47:16,780
I have to...

2400
02:47:17,440 --> 02:47:18,160
Do I need more?

2401
02:47:18,160 --> 02:47:19,200
Okay, I need 500.

2402
02:47:19,860 --> 02:47:20,960
I can grab that easily.

2403
02:47:22,200 --> 02:47:23,360
500 is not too hard.

2404
02:47:33,600 --> 02:47:34,000
Alright.

2405
02:47:34,400 --> 02:47:34,660
See?

2406
02:47:35,280 --> 02:47:36,220
So halfway there.

2407
02:47:36,240 --> 02:47:38,060
Well, we need 50 more.

2408
02:47:38,600 --> 02:47:40,840
But we're basically almost halfway there.

2409
02:47:41,820 --> 02:47:42,810
Where am I?

2410
02:47:46,340 --> 02:47:46,810
Wee!

2411
02:47:49,540 --> 02:47:52,240
My favorite farm is...

2412
02:47:53,500 --> 02:47:55,400
Oh, 550?

2413
02:47:55,740 --> 02:47:56,340
That was 5.

2414
02:47:57,700 --> 02:47:59,360
I'm just farming here.

2415
02:48:03,030 --> 02:48:03,500
Uh...

2416
02:48:03,500 --> 02:48:06,020
I need...

2417
02:48:06,020 --> 02:48:06,220
10.

2418
02:48:06,240 --> 02:48:29,720
more we got it here there you go this is basically where i spent like an hour to get three grand i spent my time farming this one area all right we're trying

2419
02:48:37,500 --> 02:48:46,340
mr broken bot thank you the super chat thank you thank you The CIA's worst thing was waterboarding, but Doki makes you sing until she is happy.

2420
02:48:46,800 --> 02:48:49,020
But she will never be happy.

2421
02:48:51,760 --> 02:48:52,940
That's right.

2422
02:48:54,440 --> 02:48:58,340
You'll never ever make me satisfied.

2423
02:48:59,320 --> 02:49:01,580
My expectations are too high.

2424
02:49:09,180 --> 02:49:11,800
You'll never reach my expectations.

2425
02:49:12,380 --> 02:49:14,040
Welcome back, Red Maiden.

2426
02:49:14,300 --> 02:49:16,060
And thank you again for coming to my aid.

2427
02:49:16,860 --> 02:49:24,260
I'm no healer, but with the supplies we found in the ward below, even my unlawful claws can ease the suffering of brothers and sisters.

2428
02:49:24,560 --> 02:49:25,480
Boy, you don't have a degree.

2429
02:49:25,920 --> 02:49:26,980
I don't think I trust you.

2430
02:49:29,420 --> 02:49:32,860
Do you even know how to clean the wounds?

2431
02:49:33,860 --> 02:49:39,120
You don't just pour it disinfected into the wound, Tremah.

2432
02:49:40,220 --> 02:49:42,120
What if the wound is infected?

2433
02:49:42,720 --> 02:49:42,860
What?

2434
02:49:45,520 --> 02:49:59,680
he has a he has a degree in faith he just believes hard enough it's like it's like if i it's like if you were a plague doctor you're like don't worry i could cure the plague we'll just need more leeches

2435
02:50:03,480 --> 02:50:17,940
that such darkness could creep into this most holier places even though we pilgrims kept our promises promise to ascend i have we have silk it's okay Just keep pouring silk into it.

2436
02:50:19,200 --> 02:50:19,800
I will confess.

2437
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:21,020
I wonder in the meaning of it all.

2438
02:50:21,200 --> 02:50:23,400
But enlightenment does not come easily or all at once.

2439
02:50:23,820 --> 02:50:25,560
I should just continue my task in the meantime.

2440
02:50:26,600 --> 02:50:28,320
All these marvelous healing supplies.

2441
02:50:28,700 --> 02:50:30,180
Should at least are some proof of this.

2442
02:50:30,560 --> 02:50:33,120
I got you the healing supplies.

2443
02:50:33,800 --> 02:50:35,800
It's not just the citadel.

2444
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:40,620
All right.

2445
02:50:41,200 --> 02:50:41,980
Where do we go?

2446
02:50:47,810 --> 02:50:48,450
Where do we go?

2447
02:50:48,470 --> 02:50:49,290
Where do we go?

2448
02:50:50,830 --> 02:50:55,830
And who saved his life when he was trying to get the supplies?

2449
02:51:03,850 --> 02:51:05,330
Where do we go?

2450
02:51:06,230 --> 02:51:06,790
Everywhere.

2451
02:51:08,390 --> 02:51:18,510
There I think, I feel like Shurama's idea of like how to be a doctor is just, don't worry, we'll just rub hand sanitizer on the wound.

2452
02:51:18,670 --> 02:51:19,370
You'll be fine.

2453
02:51:21,130 --> 02:51:21,690
Memorium.

2454
02:51:22,030 --> 02:51:22,810
How do we get there?

2455
02:51:23,990 --> 02:51:25,530
Or is that?

2456
02:51:29,530 --> 02:51:33,350
I feel like I've done all the quests I have in my inventory.

2457
02:51:35,950 --> 02:51:36,590
Yeah.

2458
02:51:41,080 --> 02:51:41,820
Go left?

2459
02:51:42,540 --> 02:51:43,100
But where?

2460
02:51:45,980 --> 02:51:46,420
Here?

2461
02:51:51,340 --> 02:51:52,660
Yeah, thank you for the super chat.

2462
02:51:52,780 --> 02:51:53,560
Thank you.

2463
02:51:53,760 --> 02:51:54,940
Up and left.

2464
02:51:55,900 --> 02:51:57,420
Go left and up?

2465
02:51:57,940 --> 02:52:01,240
Go to the hallway with the big bulky dudes.

2466
02:52:01,620 --> 02:52:02,420
Oh, here.

2467
02:52:03,580 --> 02:52:03,940
Here?

2468
02:52:11,640 --> 02:52:12,400
Okay.

2469
02:52:16,740 --> 02:52:19,460
I'll go to the room with the big bulky men.

2470
02:52:24,720 --> 02:52:25,480
Oh.

2471
02:52:26,880 --> 02:52:27,460
Oh.

2472
02:52:29,540 --> 02:52:30,300
Okay.

2473
02:52:32,080 --> 02:52:33,180
There you go.

2474
02:52:35,100 --> 02:52:36,080
Oh, where am I?

2475
02:52:37,180 --> 02:52:37,480
Oh.

2476
02:52:39,180 --> 02:52:40,140
What's this?

2477
02:52:44,300 --> 02:52:45,340
What is this place?

2478
02:52:46,260 --> 02:52:47,040
This is new.

2479
02:52:49,340 --> 02:52:51,900
Here is established by holy consent of the conductors.

2480
02:52:52,120 --> 02:52:53,280
The memoriam of Fire Loom.

2481
02:52:53,500 --> 02:52:55,740
What is remembered is never lost.

2482
02:52:56,820 --> 02:52:58,160
It's a mosque, you guys.

2483
02:53:02,360 --> 02:53:03,040
Is it a zoo?

2484
02:53:03,540 --> 02:53:04,580
Oh, it is!

2485
02:53:04,980 --> 02:53:06,180
Oh, wait, that's bad.

2486
02:53:06,960 --> 02:53:08,100
Isn't that just like...

2487
02:53:09,980 --> 02:53:11,080
That's just like...

2488
02:53:11,100 --> 02:53:12,140
Jail.

2489
02:53:14,460 --> 02:53:18,740
Guys, a human zoo is just a jail.

2490
02:53:21,840 --> 02:53:23,020
What were the crimes?

2491
02:53:28,340 --> 02:53:29,860
Holy shit, what the?

2492
02:53:38,210 --> 02:53:40,130
The crime of existing.

2493
02:53:42,270 --> 02:53:42,910
Jesus!

2494
02:53:43,850 --> 02:53:45,230
Okay, these guys are annoying.

2495
02:53:45,390 --> 02:53:46,150
I don't like them.

2496
02:53:48,910 --> 02:53:50,350
What the fuck?

2497
02:53:54,240 --> 02:53:54,800
I'm...

2498
02:53:55,420 --> 02:53:56,080
I'm scared.

2499
02:53:57,900 --> 02:53:59,580
I'm so scared.

2500
02:54:03,130 --> 02:54:03,410
Squint.

2501
02:54:06,470 --> 02:54:07,650
Okay, there we go.

2502
02:54:09,490 --> 02:54:12,110
Yeah, no, that one definitely did some form of crime.

2503
02:54:13,910 --> 02:54:15,070
Thank God they locked him up.

2504
02:54:15,770 --> 02:54:16,250
Holy shit.

2505
02:54:16,810 --> 02:54:18,410
I'm so happy he got locked up.

2506
02:54:19,670 --> 02:54:21,690
No, he absolutely deserved to be caged.

2507
02:54:25,790 --> 02:54:27,410
Do I go upward?

2508
02:54:27,750 --> 02:54:28,550
Okay, well, I don't know.

2509
02:54:31,110 --> 02:54:31,690
Up or down?

2510
02:54:33,310 --> 02:54:34,950
Assume I'll go down, actually.

2511
02:54:39,420 --> 02:54:40,420
There you go.

2512
02:54:45,420 --> 02:54:46,980
Maps the right side?

2513
02:54:47,360 --> 02:54:48,600
This right or up right?

2514
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:49,360
Oh, here.

2515
02:54:49,500 --> 02:54:49,900
This right.

2516
02:54:52,100 --> 02:54:53,120
Oh, my God.

2517
02:54:53,420 --> 02:54:54,040
Oh, my!

2518
02:54:54,160 --> 02:54:54,800
Okay, wait.

2519
02:54:55,680 --> 02:54:57,020
Oh, I'm $5.

2520
02:54:57,420 --> 02:54:58,100
Does Canadian want to spend?

2521
02:54:58,120 --> 02:54:59,040
Paying me $5.

2522
02:55:02,280 --> 02:55:03,960
It's not fair.

2523
02:55:05,540 --> 02:55:07,200
They don't even have money.

2524
02:55:07,300 --> 02:55:09,880
They don't understand the concept of money.

2525
02:55:16,330 --> 02:55:18,030
Oh my god, I'm broke.

2526
02:55:19,410 --> 02:55:23,350
These bugs don't even understand what money is.

2527
02:55:27,940 --> 02:55:30,860
And nothing even has money here.

2528
02:55:32,880 --> 02:55:34,520
It's so fucked up.

2529
02:55:40,640 --> 02:55:42,280
I hate the citadel.

2530
02:55:45,340 --> 02:55:46,420
No, I need to kill you.

2531
02:55:46,500 --> 02:55:46,860
You're still.

2532
02:55:47,960 --> 02:55:49,860
Your existence hurt me.

2533
02:55:55,760 --> 02:55:56,540
I don't know why.

2534
02:55:56,580 --> 02:55:57,320
I look at the map.

2535
02:55:58,240 --> 02:55:59,320
I can't see nothing.

2536
02:56:01,160 --> 02:56:01,600
Let's wait.

2537
02:56:01,640 --> 02:56:02,520
We don't need the map.

2538
02:56:05,140 --> 02:56:06,120
We don't need it.

2539
02:56:09,020 --> 02:56:09,900
Oh my god.

2540
02:56:12,180 --> 02:56:13,520
I got greedy.

2541
02:56:16,400 --> 02:56:17,580
Oh, God, not these guys.

2542
02:56:17,660 --> 02:56:18,120
These guys are...

2543
02:56:18,120 --> 02:56:18,880
I hate these guys.

2544
02:56:19,640 --> 02:56:21,260
I hate these ones so much.

2545
02:56:27,880 --> 02:56:29,360
I don't need no GPS.

2546
02:56:29,860 --> 02:56:32,440
I have a built-in GPS right here.

2547
02:56:32,840 --> 02:56:34,020
And it's my mind.

2548
02:56:36,060 --> 02:56:36,920
Is that it?

2549
02:56:37,620 --> 02:56:39,460
It has to be a secret here, right?

2550
02:56:40,340 --> 02:56:41,200
Oh, it's here.

2551
02:56:51,870 --> 02:56:52,630
Oh, God.

2552
02:56:52,650 --> 02:56:54,090
I hate these guys so much.

2553
02:56:55,050 --> 02:56:56,510
Are you fucking kidding me?

2554
02:56:57,270 --> 02:56:59,690
I think this is my most hated regular bug.

2555
02:57:03,170 --> 02:57:05,670
How the fuck do I kill this guy?

2556
02:57:08,430 --> 02:57:10,230
Jesus, he takes up the whole space!

2557
02:57:10,430 --> 02:57:11,230
He's so chonky!

2558
02:57:14,690 --> 02:57:17,110
Yeah, it's like pure advanced geometry, right?

2559
02:57:17,170 --> 02:57:19,290
Okay, I know how to kill him when I'm up here.

2560
02:57:19,590 --> 02:57:19,950
Oh!

2561
02:57:23,210 --> 02:57:24,010
Never mind.

2562
02:57:24,110 --> 02:57:45,970
I know how to do it And then I proceed to fall down Condemn fails Memory loss Excise outer Maintain inner Shellwood status Unstained Sustain Remember Maryland status Critical remember What?

2563
02:57:46,790 --> 02:57:48,230
It's just a lower room

2564
02:57:54,080 --> 02:57:56,400
What do I do in the lower room?

2565
02:57:57,120 --> 02:57:57,220
What?

2566
02:58:03,430 --> 02:58:04,030
Damn.

2567
02:58:05,530 --> 02:58:06,650
Oh no.

2568
02:58:07,830 --> 02:58:09,130
No, the geometry man.

2569
02:58:09,630 --> 02:58:09,970
Geometry!

2570
02:58:14,360 --> 02:58:17,080
He's lore in the lore room.

2571
02:58:18,020 --> 02:58:20,860
God damn fucking, okay, now I can go back down.

2572
02:58:21,780 --> 02:58:24,680
I can go back down and grab five dollars real quick.

2573
02:58:25,240 --> 02:58:26,380
Let me grab five dollars.

2574
02:58:29,680 --> 02:58:30,580
There we go.

2575
02:58:31,880 --> 02:58:33,260
Okay, now I have the money.

2576
02:58:39,580 --> 02:58:46,680
Okay, oh my god, and I have to, I just remembered, I have to, I have to go all the way to where I died.

2577
02:58:50,380 --> 02:58:51,340
Where did I die?

2578
02:58:52,720 --> 02:58:54,360
The question is, where?

2579
02:58:57,140 --> 02:58:58,460
Oh my god, I don't remember.

2580
02:58:59,740 --> 02:59:00,640
Okay, we go straight.

2581
02:59:04,460 --> 02:59:05,840
Yeah, the solution is really easy.

2582
02:59:05,940 --> 02:59:06,880
I just gotta rob someone.

2583
02:59:06,960 --> 02:59:07,660
I think it was right here.

2584
02:59:08,080 --> 02:59:08,940
Yeah, I went high ground.

2585
02:59:13,080 --> 02:59:13,480
Okay.

2586
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:17,120
And that went into the waterlands.

2587
02:59:19,660 --> 02:59:21,980
God damn it, I forgot to fucking...

2588
02:59:28,810 --> 02:59:29,910
Drown in the water.

2589
02:59:33,310 --> 02:59:34,090
Thank God.

2590
02:59:34,770 --> 02:59:35,310
That's right.

2591
02:59:35,550 --> 02:59:35,950
Drown.

2592
02:59:45,870 --> 02:59:46,590
I don't care.

2593
02:59:46,670 --> 02:59:48,650
As long as he dies, that's all that matters.

2594
02:59:49,250 --> 02:59:49,570
You know what?

2595
02:59:49,670 --> 02:59:50,490
I'm already committed.

2596
02:59:50,550 --> 02:59:51,170
Let's go here.

2597
02:59:52,130 --> 02:59:55,860
Oh, where is here?

2598
02:59:57,700 --> 02:59:59,860
Man, if only I have a way to figure that out.

2599
03:00:01,620 --> 03:00:02,460
Oh, elevator.

2600
03:00:07,320 --> 03:00:08,900
To imagine, I just used it.

2601
03:00:09,100 --> 03:00:10,360
I just used it on the elevator.

2602
03:00:10,520 --> 03:00:11,260
I'm going to grab the map.

2603
03:00:11,580 --> 03:00:13,560
I'm going to grab the map.

2604
03:00:21,770 --> 03:00:25,830
If only I had a map, what would I, what should I do?

2605
03:00:30,810 --> 03:00:32,590
I was this close to using it.

2606
03:00:37,900 --> 03:00:38,140
Alright.

2607
03:00:39,360 --> 03:00:39,920
Yes.

2608
03:00:48,880 --> 03:00:49,400
Alright.

2609
03:00:51,260 --> 03:00:52,440
Go left to unlock.

2610
03:00:52,560 --> 03:00:54,120
Did I not unlock it already?

2611
03:00:56,680 --> 03:00:58,180
Oh, this guy is easy.

2612
03:00:58,920 --> 03:00:59,540
Or did...

2613
03:00:59,540 --> 03:01:00,720
Oh, wait.

2614
03:01:01,040 --> 03:01:01,700
Where is it?

2615
03:01:01,900 --> 03:01:04,000
Oh my god, it didn't hit that wall.

2616
03:01:05,020 --> 03:01:07,380
I didn't realize that was a breakable wall.

2617
03:01:08,920 --> 03:01:09,480
Okay.

2618
03:01:11,380 --> 03:01:19,180
Where are they like examining like looking at these is it like those Wait, no, these are the windows.

2619
03:01:19,440 --> 03:01:22,920
Oh Oh, oh my god, you're still alive.

2620
03:01:23,440 --> 03:01:29,020
I leave I was gonna say like how are they even like looking at the zoo?

2621
03:01:37,180 --> 03:01:43,180
Oh How do I get up there?

2622
03:01:45,020 --> 03:01:48,960
Oh There you go.

2623
03:01:50,060 --> 03:01:51,220
Looks like I see it.

2624
03:02:00,040 --> 03:02:01,040
There you go.

2625
03:02:01,900 --> 03:02:02,840
Last one.

2626
03:02:03,520 --> 03:02:04,040
Top left.

2627
03:02:05,720 --> 03:02:07,000
Oh, I lost...

2628
03:02:07,880 --> 03:02:10,160
Okay, I sort of lost it, but...

2629
03:02:11,320 --> 03:02:12,000
Um...

2630
03:02:15,090 --> 03:02:16,430
I lost it.

2631
03:02:17,370 --> 03:02:18,250
Is it this one?

2632
03:02:21,010 --> 03:02:21,690
Yeah.

2633
03:02:23,530 --> 03:02:24,210
Um...

2634
03:02:26,470 --> 03:02:29,770
Um, uh, is this?

2635
03:02:30,970 --> 03:02:31,730
No elk.

2636
03:02:32,550 --> 03:02:33,210
Or is it in the middle?

2637
03:02:34,470 --> 03:02:35,850
Oh, I lost it.

2638
03:02:38,070 --> 03:02:39,770
And then the top right, yeah?

2639
03:02:40,090 --> 03:02:40,670
This one?

2640
03:02:42,510 --> 03:02:44,090
Oh, I lost it.

2641
03:02:44,770 --> 03:02:45,490
Uh, okay.

2642
03:02:51,210 --> 03:02:53,030
And this one, right?

2643
03:02:59,560 --> 03:03:01,800
Enable Rewind, who can tell you?

2644
03:03:04,440 --> 03:03:05,720
I guess.

2645
03:03:06,780 --> 03:03:08,840
Guys, okay, and then center, right?

2646
03:03:13,980 --> 03:03:15,120
Is this the center, you're like?

2647
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:20,680
My gut says maybe.

2648
03:03:22,840 --> 03:03:23,160
No?

2649
03:03:23,980 --> 03:03:24,580
Yeah?

2650
03:03:25,220 --> 03:03:26,360
Oh, mayhaps?

2651
03:03:26,520 --> 03:03:27,860
Okay, uh...

2652
03:03:31,980 --> 03:03:33,260
Oh, I fucked up.

2653
03:03:37,420 --> 03:03:39,600
Oh, my God, you fuckers.

2654
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:41,860
I forgot already.

2655
03:03:44,720 --> 03:03:45,560
I forgot already.

2656
03:03:46,960 --> 03:03:48,100
Um, um.

2657
03:03:50,560 --> 03:03:51,160
Okay.

2658
03:04:00,180 --> 03:04:01,040
Oh, my.

2659
03:04:01,140 --> 03:04:01,300
Okay.

2660
03:04:05,380 --> 03:04:06,540
There we go.

2661
03:04:08,680 --> 03:04:09,220
Yay!

2662
03:04:10,280 --> 03:04:13,280
I thought it could reset from the very beginning, so I got scared.

2663
03:04:16,060 --> 03:04:17,020
What did I unlock?

2664
03:04:19,120 --> 03:04:20,540
Oh, I got a car cart.

2665
03:04:22,140 --> 03:04:23,260
And so I was like, oh, no.

2666
03:04:28,500 --> 03:04:30,420
Okay, and then we go left.

2667
03:04:33,180 --> 03:04:35,380
I guess we're not unlocking the elevator.

2668
03:04:35,900 --> 03:04:40,200
Oh my god, the fucking... He comboed me, but all he did was just exist.

2669
03:04:45,180 --> 03:04:47,280
He just existed, sir.

2670
03:04:49,540 --> 03:04:50,680
Uh, this way.

2671
03:04:53,180 --> 03:04:54,040
I don't know.

2672
03:04:54,120 --> 03:04:57,200
I had to look up to see how... I had to look at my inventory to see how much I have.

2673
03:04:57,320 --> 03:04:58,340
I'm just gonna skip this guy.

2674
03:04:59,300 --> 03:05:01,080
There's no reason to try and kill him.

2675
03:05:07,980 --> 03:05:10,060
It's even worth activating the elevator?

2676
03:05:11,980 --> 03:05:12,800
What's here?

2677
03:05:17,020 --> 03:05:17,440
Hello?

2678
03:05:17,620 --> 03:05:18,520
Who lives here?

2679
03:05:20,860 --> 03:05:22,180
Oh.

2680
03:05:25,340 --> 03:05:26,760
It's fucked up.

2681
03:05:33,210 --> 03:05:34,170
Is there anything here?

2682
03:05:40,490 --> 03:05:41,470
What the fuck?

2683
03:05:43,810 --> 03:05:44,470
I...

2684
03:05:45,130 --> 03:05:45,590
What?

2685
03:05:52,380 --> 03:05:54,000
How do I...

2686
03:05:55,920 --> 03:05:56,580
What?

2687
03:06:06,920 --> 03:06:07,580
Oh.

2688
03:06:08,480 --> 03:06:13,390
Are you here?

2689
03:06:14,810 --> 03:06:15,210
Fuck!

2690
03:06:16,830 --> 03:06:17,510
Okay.

2691
03:06:18,350 --> 03:06:19,650
That was on me, to be fair.

2692
03:06:20,350 --> 03:06:21,350
I got confused.

2693
03:06:24,110 --> 03:06:25,670
I- ah, what?

2694
03:06:29,430 --> 03:06:30,830
I think I might be dead.

2695
03:06:33,430 --> 03:06:33,610
Oh.

2696
03:06:37,190 --> 03:06:37,870
No!

2697
03:06:38,250 --> 03:06:39,590
I don't have my double jump!

2698
03:06:49,480 --> 03:06:51,500
Oh, this is...

2699
03:06:52,500 --> 03:06:53,620
I'm gonna...

2700
03:06:53,640 --> 03:06:56,100
Oh my god, I almost ran in here.

2701
03:06:56,720 --> 03:06:58,700
I'm gonna go back down and sit on the bench.

2702
03:06:59,680 --> 03:07:02,060
Oh my god, I thought that was like toxic water.

2703
03:07:02,240 --> 03:07:02,940
And I thought I died.

2704
03:07:09,190 --> 03:07:11,390
I'm gonna head downstairs now.

2705
03:07:11,430 --> 03:07:11,650
Oh!

2706
03:07:16,900 --> 03:07:18,660
The baby, God.

2707
03:07:20,020 --> 03:07:23,980
Oh my god, the fucking baby, God.

2708
03:07:24,060 --> 03:07:24,360
See?

2709
03:07:24,860 --> 03:07:27,580
I just, I never expect a baby.

2710
03:07:28,480 --> 03:07:31,340
Whoever, whoever expects the baby.

2711
03:07:31,660 --> 03:07:33,260
No one ever expects the baby.

2712
03:07:35,620 --> 03:07:35,860
Where did...

2713
03:07:35,860 --> 03:07:36,300
Oh my gosh.

2714
03:07:37,340 --> 03:07:38,720
Of all things.

2715
03:07:42,320 --> 03:07:43,920
Why was the baby there?

2716
03:07:44,180 --> 03:07:45,580
Who let this child be here?

2717
03:07:45,660 --> 03:07:46,320
Where's his mom?

2718
03:07:46,380 --> 03:07:47,040
I killed him.

2719
03:07:47,160 --> 03:07:47,400
I forgot.

2720
03:07:51,860 --> 03:07:52,700
Yes, Doki.

2721
03:07:52,800 --> 03:07:55,480
Because you made them into orphans, remember?

2722
03:07:56,060 --> 03:07:56,780
I forgot.

2723
03:07:57,880 --> 03:07:58,840
I forgot.

2724
03:07:59,440 --> 03:08:00,800
I killed the parents.

2725
03:08:03,580 --> 03:08:06,400
Nobody ever expects the baby Inquisition.

2726
03:08:15,080 --> 03:08:16,780
Okay, we gotta grab the shortcut.

2727
03:08:20,540 --> 03:08:21,660
I don't even have to go there.

2728
03:08:24,800 --> 03:08:25,380
Wait, actually?

2729
03:08:29,180 --> 03:08:30,920
I'd never done this area yet.

2730
03:08:33,480 --> 03:08:34,700
I just realized.

2731
03:08:38,270 --> 03:08:38,990
Let's stay here.

2732
03:08:40,370 --> 03:08:40,930
Oh!

2733
03:08:40,950 --> 03:08:41,890
Oh my god, okay.

2734
03:08:42,670 --> 03:08:43,830
Wait, I have an idea.

2735
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:49,720
There we go.

2736
03:08:51,220 --> 03:08:51,780
What is this?

2737
03:08:51,880 --> 03:08:52,720
Oh, it's a memory locket.

2738
03:08:52,780 --> 03:08:53,400
Oh, we need that.

2739
03:08:53,560 --> 03:08:54,340
I have to do this all.

2740
03:08:54,780 --> 03:08:56,540
Oh my god, please tell me to just shortcut out of here.

2741
03:08:57,420 --> 03:08:59,300
Oh, I have to do all of this again.

2742
03:09:03,220 --> 03:09:04,380
I'll just kill him first.

2743
03:09:06,680 --> 03:09:07,480
Alright, nice.

2744
03:09:08,020 --> 03:09:10,800
Yeah, because I was like, wait, I haven't done the far left.

2745
03:09:11,080 --> 03:09:13,000
But the far left doesn't seem to have anything.

2746
03:09:22,280 --> 03:09:23,620
I can't heal.

2747
03:09:24,560 --> 03:09:25,020
It's fine.

2748
03:09:27,560 --> 03:09:29,840
I won't be fooled by the baby.

2749
03:09:35,150 --> 03:09:36,230
Okay, it's fine.

2750
03:09:36,890 --> 03:09:38,270
I'm still...

2751
03:09:40,150 --> 03:09:42,730
I still won't be fooled by the baby.

2752
03:09:44,450 --> 03:09:45,230
Get out of here.

2753
03:09:50,520 --> 03:09:53,000
It wasn't a baby that hurt me this time.

2754
03:09:53,160 --> 03:09:54,020
It doesn't count.

2755
03:09:55,260 --> 03:09:58,500
Instead, it was an inanimate object that never moved.

2756
03:09:58,940 --> 03:10:02,200
That doesn't mean it's worse.

2757
03:10:05,340 --> 03:10:05,860
How?

2758
03:10:14,140 --> 03:10:15,100
Okay, there you go.

2759
03:10:17,340 --> 03:10:18,980
Oh, it was just for silk.

2760
03:10:23,580 --> 03:10:24,720
What's this?

2761
03:10:25,180 --> 03:10:26,180
He's shaking his booty.

2762
03:10:28,900 --> 03:10:29,480
I want yourself.

2763
03:10:30,720 --> 03:10:31,500
I'm gonna smack...

2764
03:10:31,500 --> 03:10:32,020
Oh, shit.

2765
03:10:35,960 --> 03:10:42,740
there we go and it's still not enough silk oh oh my gosh

2766
03:10:45,940 --> 03:10:47,520
what's over here

2767
03:10:53,050 --> 03:11:08,270
what is over here oh it's another shortcut the baby was just eating and i'm like you all right oh i got full heart all right where do we go Got a full heart.

2768
03:11:10,270 --> 03:11:11,850
Now where do we go?

2769
03:11:12,310 --> 03:11:15,270
Go to back to a map room in Memor...

2770
03:11:16,150 --> 03:11:16,630
Mem...

2771
03:11:16,630 --> 03:11:17,030
What?

2772
03:11:19,310 --> 03:11:19,790
Memorium?

2773
03:11:20,030 --> 03:11:21,310
I have to go back to the map room.

2774
03:11:21,490 --> 03:11:21,730
Why?

2775
03:11:22,770 --> 03:11:24,030
Oh, I missed that room?

2776
03:11:24,450 --> 03:11:24,610
Okay.

2777
03:11:28,950 --> 03:11:29,430
Memorium.

2778
03:11:29,630 --> 03:11:30,150
That's over here.

2779
03:11:33,310 --> 03:11:34,830
Oh, I should sit on the bench.

2780
03:11:36,510 --> 03:11:37,330
I forgot about that.

2781
03:11:38,190 --> 03:11:38,510
Alright.

2782
03:11:38,690 --> 03:11:39,390
He should be back, right?

2783
03:11:39,410 --> 03:11:39,970
Oh, no.

2784
03:11:41,490 --> 03:11:42,410
Top of the memoriam?

2785
03:11:42,830 --> 03:11:42,870
Oh!

2786
03:11:44,510 --> 03:11:45,670
I didn't go top right.

2787
03:11:47,050 --> 03:11:48,710
I didn't realize that.

2788
03:11:53,930 --> 03:11:54,990
It's right here.

2789
03:11:59,120 --> 03:12:00,160
He's just eating.

2790
03:12:00,680 --> 03:12:02,340
I was like, you die now.

2791
03:12:02,840 --> 03:12:05,240
How dare you just eat in front of me?

2792
03:12:05,640 --> 03:12:07,820
There's some people who haven't been eaten yet.

2793
03:12:10,680 --> 03:12:14,180
People in Africa are starving and you're just eating?

2794
03:12:15,140 --> 03:12:16,680
Oh, I don't like this.

2795
03:12:21,070 --> 03:12:21,550
Alright.

2796
03:12:22,410 --> 03:12:23,710
That was a little too close.

2797
03:12:29,200 --> 03:12:30,400
I'll go here.

2798
03:12:30,480 --> 03:12:31,420
Oh, I want to grab this.

2799
03:12:33,460 --> 03:12:33,940
Maturium.

2800
03:12:34,660 --> 03:12:35,920
Where the fuck is Maturium?

2801
03:12:41,260 --> 03:12:42,580
Okay, now I'm up here.

2802
03:12:44,320 --> 03:12:45,160
Oh, silk!

2803
03:12:47,240 --> 03:12:47,720
Yay!

2804
03:12:48,220 --> 03:12:48,900
Free silk.

2805
03:12:50,040 --> 03:12:51,120
Oh, hidden water.

2806
03:12:51,220 --> 03:13:10,940

2808
03:13:25,360 --> 03:13:26,120
I knew it.

2809
03:13:27,980 --> 03:13:28,940
Okay, vault vessel.

2810
03:13:29,200 --> 03:13:29,980
Okay, it's another 12.

2811
03:13:31,200 --> 03:13:32,880
It's worth it.

2812
03:13:36,060 --> 03:13:38,980
Like, how do we trick Doki to go into this trap?

2813
03:13:43,240 --> 03:13:45,920
Sometimes I'm too fast for my own good.

2814
03:13:49,100 --> 03:13:49,620
Oh.

2815
03:13:50,840 --> 03:13:52,300
It's chungus flea.

2816
03:13:53,360 --> 03:13:54,020
Hello, flea.

2817
03:13:54,500 --> 03:13:55,640
Who's I'm good for?

2818
03:13:55,920 --> 03:13:57,620
I'm here to save you.

2819
03:13:58,000 --> 03:13:58,600
Oh.

2820
03:14:01,180 --> 03:14:02,260
Oh my god.

2821
03:14:02,440 --> 03:14:03,340
Oh my god.

2822
03:14:03,500 --> 03:14:04,240
You're good for nothing.

2823
03:14:04,600 --> 03:14:05,220
Bad dog.

2824
03:14:05,700 --> 03:14:06,660
Bad dog.

2825
03:14:08,820 --> 03:14:09,800
Oh my god.

2826
03:14:09,880 --> 03:14:10,880
You're a bad boy.

2827
03:14:11,240 --> 03:14:12,300
You're a bad boy.

2828
03:14:14,460 --> 03:14:15,800
Oh my god.

2829
03:14:16,000 --> 03:14:16,920
Oh I did it.

2830
03:14:17,580 --> 03:14:17,580
Oh.

2831
03:14:20,040 --> 03:14:21,940
Savage flea fly.

2832
03:14:22,340 --> 03:14:54,240
Why is he so big you see the other fleas were just little chihuahuas and he's like the golden retriever oh look at the journal entry someone's been a bad boy i will never get so large and marvelous a flea existed i'm pleased it's our sense by the strike a killing blood jesus christ briefly consumed by anger after it's been caged for so long Yeah,

2833
03:14:54,400 --> 03:14:55,320

2834
03:14:56,320 --> 03:14:57,800
Yay, we did it!

2835
03:15:00,560 --> 03:15:02,040
Alright, where do we go now?

2836
03:15:06,320 --> 03:15:06,800
Yeah.

2837
03:15:07,520 --> 03:15:08,580
Fuck this kid.

2838
03:15:11,220 --> 03:15:11,780
Map room?

2839
03:15:12,020 --> 03:15:13,860
Okay, let me...

2840
03:15:13,860 --> 03:15:15,180
Alright, I'm gonna sit on the bench.

2841
03:15:15,880 --> 03:15:16,560
Bench time!

2842
03:15:20,200 --> 03:15:20,820
There you go.

2843
03:15:24,960 --> 03:15:26,780
Oh no, he actually... Oh shit!

2844
03:15:28,020 --> 03:15:30,400
I didn't think he'd do damage.

2845
03:15:31,300 --> 03:15:33,860
Like, why am I so weak against children?

2846
03:15:34,460 --> 03:15:36,040
It's literally a child.

2847
03:15:36,700 --> 03:15:41,380
And it does, like, 10 damage, like, 5 damage on me or some shit.

2848
03:15:43,600 --> 03:15:44,960
What do I do in Map Room?

2849
03:15:46,840 --> 03:15:48,080
Good roll.

2850
03:15:51,420 --> 03:15:52,640
It's in the ceiling.

2851
03:15:55,220 --> 03:15:56,200
Oh, this?

2852
03:15:56,800 --> 03:15:59,180
Oh, there it is.

2853
03:16:02,800 --> 03:16:03,280
Hello.

2854
03:16:04,880 --> 03:16:05,840
It's outside.

2855
03:16:07,220 --> 03:16:08,360
Oh my god, I can go outside.

2856
03:16:10,560 --> 03:16:12,260
Do I just go outside?

2857
03:16:15,180 --> 03:16:16,500
This looks like a boss fight.

2858
03:16:16,680 --> 03:16:18,560
Did you guys took me to a boss fight again?

2859
03:16:19,160 --> 03:16:20,880
You guys took me to a boss fight, didn't you?

2860
03:16:25,590 --> 03:16:26,070
Hello?

2861
03:16:27,010 --> 03:16:28,250
Is anybody here?

2862
03:16:29,690 --> 03:16:30,170
Hello?

2863
03:16:30,650 --> 03:16:32,790
Oh, no, it's just item.

2864
03:16:32,990 --> 03:16:33,450
Thank God.

2865
03:16:34,390 --> 03:16:35,430
Wait, it's just a shark bundle.

2866
03:16:36,310 --> 03:16:38,310
Maybe go outside for a shark bundle?

2867
03:16:47,060 --> 03:16:47,580
What?

2868
03:16:50,560 --> 03:16:52,140
Yeah, I see that.

2869
03:16:55,060 --> 03:16:55,860
There you go.

2870
03:16:58,140 --> 03:16:59,020
There you go.

2871
03:16:59,280 --> 03:17:00,600
I got the passage.

2872
03:17:01,040 --> 03:17:02,220
Oh, my God, it's more parkour.

2873
03:17:02,820 --> 03:17:03,120
Okay.

2874
03:17:05,420 --> 03:17:05,940
Okay.

2875
03:17:08,760 --> 03:17:09,800
There we go.

2876
03:17:10,840 --> 03:17:11,400
Parkour!

2877
03:17:15,020 --> 03:17:16,060
Is I go this way?

2878
03:17:25,920 --> 03:17:28,580
Wow, I can't believe it was a dead end, guys.

2879
03:17:30,120 --> 03:17:31,660
I can't believe it.

2880
03:17:35,120 --> 03:17:36,880
Wow, that's so unfortunate.

2881
03:17:38,080 --> 03:17:40,680
That this tunnel was just a dead end.

2882
03:17:46,000 --> 03:17:48,660
Oh my god, it's required!

2883
03:17:49,300 --> 03:17:51,720
You see, I don't know if you're fucking with me, too.

2884
03:17:52,120 --> 03:17:53,600
Just to give me more...

2885
03:17:53,600 --> 03:17:54,760
Just to give me pain.

2886
03:17:57,620 --> 03:17:59,540
Oh my god.

2887
03:18:01,240 --> 03:18:02,740
Just so I can suffer.

2888
03:18:03,580 --> 03:18:05,160
Yo, get back in there.

2889
03:18:05,320 --> 03:18:06,280
It's not over.

2890
03:18:06,760 --> 03:18:08,800
Until I say it's over.

2891
03:18:12,530 --> 03:18:13,510
What's here?

2892
03:18:18,100 --> 03:18:18,900
Jesus!

2893
03:18:19,580 --> 03:18:20,380
What the?

2894
03:18:24,200 --> 03:18:26,080
Oh my god, this place sucks.

2895
03:18:26,940 --> 03:18:27,760
This place sucks.

2896
03:18:31,420 --> 03:18:33,100
They're so tanky.

2897
03:18:39,820 --> 03:18:42,860
They're actually so tanky, too.

2898
03:18:44,080 --> 03:18:45,360
I don't understand this area.

2899
03:18:59,280 --> 03:19:00,080
Okay.

2900
03:19:01,460 --> 03:19:03,360
Oh my god, that again!

2901
03:19:03,480 --> 03:19:08,080
Oh, I did it again!

2902
03:19:08,320 --> 03:19:08,320
Ah,

2903
03:19:11,860 --> 03:19:12,820
good roll.

2904
03:19:22,090 --> 03:19:26,150
This area is so serious.

2905
03:19:26,270 --> 03:19:28,190
I hate this area.

2906
03:19:29,370 --> 03:19:30,930
Oh my god.

2907
03:19:31,950 --> 03:19:34,430
Why would you take me here?

2908
03:19:35,510 --> 03:19:38,490
What did I do to deserve it?

2909
03:19:44,380 --> 03:19:45,040
I don't understand.

2910
03:19:45,340 --> 03:19:47,340
I thought I've been a good boy.

2911
03:19:51,080 --> 03:19:53,980
What did I do to deserve this?

2912
03:20:02,740 --> 03:20:04,460
Wait, you're- wait, what?

2913
03:20:04,680 --> 03:20:06,900
Why do I- you guys were friendly before?

2914
03:20:15,180 --> 03:20:17,480
Oh my god, I'm done.

2915
03:20:18,200 --> 03:20:20,280
I'm not okay right now.

2916
03:20:26,970 --> 03:20:27,590
Wee!

2917
03:20:30,930 --> 03:20:31,530
Bye.

2918
03:20:32,850 --> 03:20:33,810
It's fine.

2919
03:20:34,450 --> 03:20:35,810
Oh my god, how do I...

2920
03:20:36,650 --> 03:20:37,810
How do I...

2921
03:20:38,370 --> 03:20:39,250
How do I...

2922
03:20:40,030 --> 03:20:40,930
There you go.

2923
03:20:41,390 --> 03:20:42,150
I hurt him.

2924
03:20:43,250 --> 03:20:44,490
And then I accidentally fell.

2925
03:20:44,790 --> 03:20:46,150
And oh my...

2926
03:20:48,570 --> 03:20:49,430
It's okay.

2927
03:20:52,940 --> 03:20:54,620
I'm so scared I'm gonna get hit by it.

2928
03:20:56,060 --> 03:20:56,840
There you go.

2929
03:21:02,100 --> 03:21:03,680
Wait, what's down here?

2930
03:21:08,690 --> 03:21:11,050
Oh my god, I thought I hit it!

2931
03:21:12,770 --> 03:21:13,890
Oh my god, it's just...

2932
03:21:15,370 --> 03:21:15,890

Okay.

2935
03:21:23,020 --> 03:21:24,820
I got double hit.

2936
03:21:25,840 --> 03:21:27,680
I don't know what it is about them.

2937
03:21:27,760 --> 03:21:28,480
I just...

2938
03:21:28,480 --> 03:21:30,060
It's like those angler fishes.

Oh, I don't want to use this.

03:26:29,700 --> 03:26:30,700
There we go.

2993
03:26:31,400 --> 03:26:33,380
I don't care if I'm wasting my...

2994
03:26:33,380 --> 03:26:35,960
If I'm wasting my shards, I don't care.

3001
03:26:51,380 --> 03:26:52,600
Time for help.

3002
03:26:59,230 --> 03:27:03,650
There you go.

3003
03:27:07,070 --> 03:27:07,470
This way.

3004
03:27:09,650 --> 03:27:10,710
Back again.

3005
03:27:14,210 --> 03:27:15,310
Back to hell.

3006
03:27:15,830 --> 03:27:16,510
I go.

3007
03:27:17,630 --> 03:27:20,370
Alright, at least I can afford the bench now.

3008
03:27:20,690 --> 03:27:22,070
Thanks fucking god.

3009
03:27:27,710 --> 03:27:29,030
Oh my god.

3010
03:27:29,690 --> 03:27:32,070
that decided to not follow his family.

3011
03:27:33,310 --> 03:27:35,650
Should have stuck with your family, sir.

3012
03:27:37,310 --> 03:27:38,970
I forgot about this parkour section.

3013
03:27:49,240 --> 03:27:50,900
Oh, the fucking snipe.

3014
03:27:52,020 --> 03:27:53,660
Because of course he did.

3015
03:28:01,600 --> 03:28:02,720
Alright, this way.

3016
03:28:06,020 --> 03:28:06,420
Okay.

3017
03:28:06,840 --> 03:28:07,780
Bench is here.

3018
03:28:10,340 --> 03:28:13,040

3019
03:28:16,120 --> 03:28:34,400

03:28:47,780 --> 03:28:49,720
You better come over here.

3021
03:28:51,000 --> 03:28:53,340
If I have to be here, you have to be here too.

3022
03:28:55,020 --> 03:28:57,680
You suffer with me in this cursed place.

3023
03:29:04,240 --> 03:29:05,500
Oh my god, I forgot.

3024
03:29:06,160 --> 03:29:07,980
I know he was just there.

3025
03:29:08,500 --> 03:29:10,120
But I forgot he existed.

3026
03:29:10,640 --> 03:29:14,500
He, like, disappeared for five seconds and I already forgot he was here.

3027
03:29:17,740 --> 03:29:18,260
Okay.

3028
03:29:21,100 --> 03:29:24,100
If he's not in front of me, he was not real.

3029
03:29:25,620 --> 03:29:26,380
There we go.

3030
03:29:30,050 --> 03:29:31,790
I'm like thinking, is there...

3031
03:29:32,610 --> 03:29:35,890
Yeah, because like I was like wondering, is there something up here?

3032
03:29:37,690 --> 03:29:39,550
Oh, I think it's just a...

3033
03:29:41,310 --> 03:29:42,870
It's just a shortcut, right?

3034
03:29:43,270 --> 03:29:45,030
So I don't have to fight that guy?

3035
03:29:50,090 --> 03:29:50,790
What's this?

3036
03:29:53,230 --> 03:29:53,710
Hello?

3037
03:29:54,450 --> 03:29:55,250
He's dead.

3038
03:29:56,230 --> 03:29:57,010
Oh, the key.

3039
03:29:57,570 --> 03:29:59,170
Oh, wait, I remember this key.

3040
03:29:59,770 --> 03:30:02,590
I don't know where it goes, but I remember it.

3041
03:30:05,610 --> 03:30:06,450
No, no!

3042
03:30:08,230 --> 03:30:09,430
I'm so sad.

3043
03:30:11,090 --> 03:30:12,750
I'm so sad, my beautiful silly.

3044
03:30:14,190 --> 03:30:14,730
Like, how?

3045
03:30:24,160 --> 03:30:25,980
Okay, who lives here?

3046
03:30:26,560 --> 03:30:27,720
Hello, sir.

3047
03:30:28,140 --> 03:30:28,400
What?

3048
03:30:30,800 --> 03:30:33,100
Jesus Christ, are you just like...

3049
03:30:33,740 --> 03:30:35,980
Bro, these all just dead...

3050
03:30:35,980 --> 03:30:36,220
Oh, hey.

3051
03:30:36,500 --> 03:30:37,040
I guess it's here.

3052
03:30:37,600 --> 03:30:37,880
Nice.

3053
03:30:39,240 --> 03:30:40,500
See, even a body...

3054
03:30:40,500 --> 03:30:43,660
If a body can be a bench, why don't I just do that all the time?

3055
03:30:45,200 --> 03:30:46,900
Are you okay, sir?

3056
03:30:48,920 --> 03:30:49,400
Like...

3057
03:30:49,940 --> 03:30:55,680
There's a lot of mud and rotten bodies here that you're just breathing in.

3058
03:30:56,000 --> 03:30:57,920
It's not good for your lungs.

3059
03:30:59,480 --> 03:30:59,960
Spider!

3060
03:31:01,740 --> 03:31:03,640
Your sensuous string...

3061
03:31:03,740 --> 03:31:04,380
It's similar.

3062
03:31:04,980 --> 03:31:07,300
Your tension has smelt strong.

3063
03:31:07,840 --> 03:31:09,700
Do I seem a threat to you?

3064
03:31:12,120 --> 03:31:14,820
This whole land keeps me cautious, tall one.

3065
03:31:14,920 --> 03:31:16,740
And your claws like to have much sharp use.

3066
03:31:17,800 --> 03:31:19,380
Yes, I kill gladly.

3067
03:31:19,900 --> 03:31:21,540
Bone leaf to feed my shell.

3068
03:31:22,000 --> 03:31:25,080
Oh, she laid eggs on all these dead bodies.

3069
03:31:26,040 --> 03:31:27,420
Oh, you're a meat.

3070
03:31:27,820 --> 03:31:30,780
Much sustenance it could grant, but too hard to pry.

3071
03:31:31,180 --> 03:31:33,720
Your long, false claws would slash back.

3072
03:31:33,740 --> 03:31:41,920
Good, so you can sense my skill as I yours, a true scent that we both shall live beyond our meaning.

3073
03:31:43,160 --> 03:31:48,880
You say, spider, my brood needs meat, much the organs of others.

3074
03:31:49,400 --> 03:31:51,560
Would you set off for your own?

3075
03:31:53,160 --> 03:31:57,520
Gifts the shells warm inside as we feast for my brood's birth meal?

3076
03:31:57,800 --> 03:31:59,920
All right, time to kill other bugs.

3077
03:32:00,480 --> 03:32:02,220
Yay, cannibalism!

3078
03:32:03,400 --> 03:32:03,720
No.

3079
03:32:03,740 --> 03:32:05,920
And I offer my own organs, Hunter.

3080
03:32:06,100 --> 03:32:07,940
Do I may bring the meat of the other slain?

3081
03:32:08,500 --> 03:32:09,920
Good, Spider.

3082
03:32:10,700 --> 03:32:12,520
Scorched, shredded, seared.

3083
03:32:13,040 --> 03:32:13,880
Bring it all.

3084
03:32:14,320 --> 03:32:16,100
Some of my tools compare the meat as you request.

3085
03:32:16,260 --> 03:32:19,260
I unfortunately find so very an arsenal within your lands.

3086
03:32:19,540 --> 03:32:23,080
My brood has not long till hatching, Spider.

3087
03:32:23,640 --> 03:32:27,640
Do your duty swift, and you shall cease reward for slaughter.

3088
03:32:28,860 --> 03:32:29,420
All right.

3089
03:32:33,260 --> 03:32:40,340
Seared organ Use tools to acquire organs of various Meats to hunt us Okay what tools do I use

3090
03:32:43,640 --> 03:32:53,340
What tools are these Doesn't even say Seared organ, shredded organ, skewered organ Are they kill bugs of the saw This one?

3091
03:32:54,480 --> 03:32:57,240
I don't have the fire tool Oh my god

3092
03:33:01,550 --> 03:33:06,750
Fire piercing and slash What other does What other does What does...

3093
03:33:08,890 --> 03:33:10,790
Saw, Flint, and Longpin.

3094
03:33:11,610 --> 03:33:12,190
Oh, okay.

3095
03:33:14,070 --> 03:33:15,070
Oh, this works too?

3096
03:33:15,170 --> 03:33:16,710
Okay, we'll do these two first.

3097
03:33:16,850 --> 03:33:19,130
Oh my god, this is a mission where it requires tools.

3098
03:33:19,590 --> 03:33:21,310
That's so awkward for me.

3099
03:33:21,990 --> 03:33:23,630
After I was like, I don't need tools.

3100
03:33:26,770 --> 03:33:28,990
I had plenty, I was like, I have plenty of shards.

3101
03:33:30,330 --> 03:33:30,730
Okay.

3102
03:33:35,190 --> 03:33:36,010
Alright, alright.

3103
03:33:36,310 --> 03:33:36,970
Let's see.

3104
03:33:43,220 --> 03:33:45,720
Alright, we have to kill these guys.

3105
03:33:48,160 --> 03:33:50,100
Okay, I don't ever use this one before.

3106
03:33:55,030 --> 03:33:55,590
Does this work?

3107
03:33:56,570 --> 03:33:57,390
Did that work?

3108
03:33:58,250 --> 03:33:59,530
Oh my god, he...

3109
03:33:59,530 --> 03:34:01,470
Oh my god, and I fell in the water!

3110
03:34:05,810 --> 03:34:09,630
Okay, he fell in the water and I fell in the water.

3111
03:34:12,030 --> 03:34:12,870
Okay, let's go.

3117
03:35:56,340 --> 03:35:56,680
There you go.

3118
03:35:56,860 --> 03:35:57,880
Oh my god, that's a lot.

3119
03:36:03,600 --> 03:36:06,120
Yeah, what's wrong with a little bit of poison?

3120
03:36:07,580 --> 03:36:08,080
Okay, wait.

3121
03:36:08,180 --> 03:36:09,200
How much do I have to do?

3122
03:36:10,540 --> 03:36:11,440
Four out of ten.

3123
03:36:11,520 --> 03:36:12,240
Oh, that's fine.

3124
03:36:13,960 --> 03:36:15,320
I'll just farm these three.

3125
03:36:20,560 --> 03:36:20,960
Nice.

3126
03:36:21,080 --> 03:36:22,220
And there's one over here.

3127
03:36:22,440 --> 03:36:23,420
I might as well just grab them all.

3128
03:36:24,800 --> 03:36:28,750
What the fuck?

3129
03:36:29,330 --> 03:36:29,330
Okay.

3130
03:36:29,870 --> 03:36:30,310
Give me a second.

3131
03:36:30,650 --> 03:36:31,130
There you go.

3132
03:36:31,610 --> 03:36:32,510
I had to angle it.

3133
03:36:32,630 --> 03:36:33,410
I was like, wait a minute.

3134
03:36:35,370 --> 03:36:35,410
No!

3135
03:36:35,710 --> 03:36:37,790
I accidentally RB'd!

3136
03:36:38,830 --> 03:36:40,070
I'm sad.

3137
03:36:42,270 --> 03:36:44,110
I accidentally RB'd.

3138
03:36:46,050 --> 03:36:49,790
There was some juicy meat right here.

3139
03:36:50,850 --> 03:36:53,770
Some juicy meat that I couldn't grab.

3140
03:36:58,740 --> 03:37:00,520
Trurias, mirror explosion.

3141
03:37:00,660 --> 03:37:01,800
Oh, wait, let's try that.

3142
03:37:03,780 --> 03:37:05,380
I just have to bind, right?

3143
03:37:05,800 --> 03:37:07,140
How do I even use it?

3144
03:37:08,940 --> 03:37:10,380
Oh, okay, I don't have enough.

3145
03:37:11,120 --> 03:37:11,620
Never mind.

3146
03:37:11,800 --> 03:37:12,780
I don't have enough.

3147
03:37:17,630 --> 03:37:18,070
Alright.

3148
03:37:19,030 --> 03:37:20,350
Wait, do I have all of it?

3149
03:37:21,170 --> 03:37:21,970
I think that's 10.

3150
03:37:23,710 --> 03:37:26,190
Alright, now Jesus, that's so many.

3151
03:37:34,300 --> 03:37:35,180
Holy shit!

3152
03:37:36,060 --> 03:37:36,920
Oh my!

3153
03:37:37,020 --> 03:37:38,680
That's a lot of Shredded organs.

3154
03:37:39,820 --> 03:37:40,120
I did not.

3155
03:37:40,220 --> 03:37:43,700
I was like, oh my god, I need to farm 35, but it gives like so many.

3156
03:37:46,340 --> 03:37:48,120
Yeah, I actually shredded them.

3157
03:37:50,340 --> 03:37:53,060
Yeah, thank God Shred Drops multiple organs.

3158
03:37:54,080 --> 03:37:57,420
Alright, and then we gotta Try... What was it?

3159
03:37:57,740 --> 03:37:58,300
This one?

3160
03:38:01,640 --> 03:38:03,320
Yeah, Shredded is the easiest.

3161
03:38:07,230 --> 03:38:07,670
Okay.

3162
03:38:07,770 --> 03:38:09,850
I should kill out of this.

3163
03:38:12,770 --> 03:38:13,770
Stop jumping!

3164
03:38:15,770 --> 03:38:17,990
I wasted so many...

3165
03:38:17,990 --> 03:38:21,610
So many tools for that because he kept jumping.

3166
03:38:30,540 --> 03:38:31,760
Oh, don't worry.

3167
03:38:32,660 --> 03:38:33,560
Follow this.

3168
03:38:35,540 --> 03:38:35,920
All right.

3169
03:38:36,440 --> 03:38:36,660
Whoops.

3170
03:38:37,780 --> 03:38:38,560
How many was that?

3171
03:38:39,500 --> 03:38:41,560
I need... All right, one more run.

3172
03:38:45,710 --> 03:38:48,610
Wait, I could change how the saw works?

3173
03:38:49,150 --> 03:38:49,830
I didn't even know that.

3174
03:38:49,930 --> 03:38:51,070
I've just been using it normally.

3175
03:38:55,230 --> 03:38:56,010
That's a lie.

3176
03:38:56,590 --> 03:38:57,750
There's only one use.

3177
03:39:04,670 --> 03:39:05,790
Oh, not the saw?

3178
03:39:06,110 --> 03:39:06,670
Which one?

3179
03:39:09,970 --> 03:39:10,490
Oh!

3180
03:39:11,050 --> 03:39:14,830
The vessel can be thrown as a bowler for it or staked as a spear.

3181
03:39:17,370 --> 03:39:18,450
I'll throw it.

3182
03:39:18,730 --> 03:39:19,050
Fuck it.

3183
03:39:19,110 --> 03:39:19,950
Throwing is easier.

3184
03:39:21,150 --> 03:39:21,670
Okay.

3185
03:39:23,130 --> 03:39:25,370
Throwing seems a little easier.

3186
03:39:31,100 --> 03:39:32,480
Oh, never mind.

3187
03:39:35,600 --> 03:39:36,740
Oh, yes, it does do it.

3188
03:39:36,940 --> 03:39:37,740
Nice, Seared.

3189
03:39:43,280 --> 03:39:43,920
Okay.

3190
03:39:45,060 --> 03:39:47,080
That should be...

3191
03:39:49,600 --> 03:39:50,380
Okay, 35.

3192
03:39:57,190 --> 03:39:57,910
Alright.

3193
03:39:58,670 --> 03:39:59,430
One more.

3194
03:40:00,070 --> 03:40:01,590
Get over here, guys.

3195
03:40:02,670 --> 03:40:03,070
Wait.

3196
03:40:04,970 --> 03:40:05,370
Oh.

3197
03:40:05,630 --> 03:40:06,090
Oh, nice.

3198
03:40:06,170 --> 03:40:07,290
I can stab it.

3199
03:40:08,210 --> 03:40:08,810
That's good.

3200
03:40:09,430 --> 03:40:11,190
I can also stab it on the ground.

3201
03:40:11,350 --> 03:40:13,050
Like, stab them with it and it counts.

3202
03:40:19,200 --> 03:40:21,400
Oh, I can hit it while it's in the ground and it moves.

3203
03:40:21,620 --> 03:40:21,940
Oh!

3204
03:40:22,960 --> 03:40:24,020
Let's get to know.

3205
03:40:27,530 --> 03:40:28,970
The other mode is easier.

3206
03:40:29,090 --> 03:40:29,930
Alright, I'll try it out.

3207
03:40:30,790 --> 03:40:32,150
Oh, I can't try it out.

3208
03:40:32,390 --> 03:40:33,870
I'll try out the next one.

3209
03:40:43,330 --> 03:40:45,330
God damn it, stop jumping!

3210
03:40:46,090 --> 03:40:46,620
That's it.

3211
03:40:48,910 --> 03:40:49,570
No!

3212
03:40:50,170 --> 03:40:52,210
It fell on the ground.

3213
03:40:53,430 --> 03:40:56,030
It fell on the ground.

3214
03:41:00,680 --> 03:41:01,980
I hate you.

3215
03:41:02,400 --> 03:41:04,320
I hate you so much.

3216
03:41:06,920 --> 03:41:08,480

Two more.

3223
03:42:44,340 --> 03:42:44,980
That's fine.

3224
03:42:45,100 --> 03:42:46,100
There's two over here.

Alright, I'll leave you alive.

3228
03:42:56,910 --> 03:42:58,590
Tell the people what you saw.

3229
03:43:00,330 --> 03:43:01,630
Alright, wish updated.

3230
03:43:06,160 --> 03:43:07,660
Why don't you just angle for more speed?

3231
03:43:07,740 --> 03:43:08,620
Because I'm lazy.

3232
03:43:11,260 --> 03:43:14,000
Okay, now I can get my regular...

3233
03:43:14,020 --> 03:43:33,410

3235
03:43:59,260 --> 03:44:03,000
I really don't want to go back to the pile or whatever.

3236
03:44:08,360 --> 03:44:10,100
So I'm glad, guys, right?

3237
03:44:10,520 --> 03:44:13,300
That it's not required, right?

3238
03:44:14,120 --> 03:44:14,800
Rackery?

3239
03:44:15,420 --> 03:44:16,220
Yeah, guys?

3240
03:44:16,740 --> 03:44:17,140
Yeah?

3241
03:44:17,600 --> 03:44:20,120
It's not required or anything, right?

3242
03:44:20,300 --> 03:44:24,080
Oh my god, I keep fucking standing into that goddamn stupid trap.

3243
03:44:26,640 --> 03:44:27,400
Uh-huh.

3244
03:44:28,880 --> 03:44:31,220
Never have to go back there.

3245
03:44:32,460 --> 03:44:32,860
Ha-ha.

3246
03:44:36,120 --> 03:44:37,000
All right.

3247
03:44:38,140 --> 03:44:38,620
Bench time.

3248
03:44:39,920 --> 03:44:42,100
You have them, Spider.

3249
03:44:42,460 --> 03:44:43,800
The smell is upon you.

3250
03:44:44,140 --> 03:44:46,960
All those organs rich prepared for feasting.

3251
03:44:47,580 --> 03:44:49,240
Yes, I did my job.

3252
03:44:53,020 --> 03:44:54,900
There's a buggy bug world out there.

3253
03:44:55,420 --> 03:44:57,120
You've done well, Spider.

3254
03:44:58,420 --> 03:45:56,940
meats my children will gorge and grow and better the organs of others than they feed upon your own yes one cannot be surprised for the spider to perceive the truth of my request child of one like you many times i've seen it similar they're born hungry with sharp tooth and claw and a birth craze your own meat would delight as much as another bugs this beast is a distraction and hopes to save your own shell oh she didn't want the bugs to eat the eat her like she didn't eater is that shameful a mother who would not sacrifice herself for children to grow strong is it wrong to want to want to witness their first flight their first hunt to see them killing and grow well i mean if they're if they eat you technically you get to witness them killing for the first time your choice is your own tall mother you won't be judged by me i've seen enough sacrifices I have no love for the act.

3255
03:45:57,900 --> 03:45:58,600
All I'm saying...

3256
03:45:58,600 --> 03:45:59,460
Oh, it's Lawn Claw.

3257
03:46:00,560 --> 03:46:01,040
Eh.

3258
03:46:02,380 --> 03:46:04,240
I mean, the poison, though.

3259
03:46:04,300 --> 03:46:07,220
The poison and the shard, the binding is just so much better.

3260
03:46:08,900 --> 03:46:10,600
I feel like...

3261
03:46:10,600 --> 03:46:13,600
Isn't it even cooler to see your kids eat you?

3262
03:46:16,640 --> 03:46:17,680
Like, you're...

3263
03:46:17,680 --> 03:46:22,360
Just before you die, you get to see your children eat you from inside out.

3264
03:46:24,920 --> 03:46:25,720
be an honor.

3265
03:46:28,580 --> 03:46:29,400
That'd be the last...

3266
03:46:29,400 --> 03:46:30,160
I swear to God.

3267
03:46:30,520 --> 03:46:32,540
I swear to fucking... Oh!

3268
03:46:32,740 --> 03:46:33,300
Like, okay.

3269
03:46:36,380 --> 03:46:37,360
I hate him.

3270
03:46:41,080 --> 03:46:42,500
God, I hate him so much.

3271
03:46:49,700 --> 03:46:50,140
I...

3272
03:46:50,140 --> 03:46:51,020
Get over here.

3273
03:46:51,840 --> 03:46:52,680
I'll kill you.

3274
03:46:52,740 --> 03:46:53,180
I don't care.

3275
03:46:56,400 --> 03:46:57,760
Oh my God, you fucker.

3276
03:46:58,400 --> 03:46:59,480
That is...

3277
03:46:59,980 --> 03:47:00,740
I'll still kill you.

3278
03:47:00,780 --> 03:47:01,360
I don't care.

3279
03:47:02,240 --> 03:47:04,460
I will kill him if it's the last thing I do.

3280
03:47:09,800 --> 03:47:10,040
Okay.

3281
03:47:11,740 --> 03:47:12,160
That's fine.

3282
03:47:12,380 --> 03:47:13,920
Oh my god, I dodged it.

3283
03:47:17,980 --> 03:47:19,000
Oh, but I'm not fighting.

3284
03:47:19,180 --> 03:47:19,840
Any of these?

3285
03:47:20,080 --> 03:47:20,520
No!

3286
03:47:22,920 --> 03:47:23,620
It's okay.

3287
03:47:25,960 --> 03:47:27,880
I refuse to fight any of them.

3288
03:47:34,220 --> 03:47:34,900
I knew it.

3289
03:47:35,080 --> 03:47:36,440
I knew that was a secret passage.

3290
03:47:38,540 --> 03:47:39,500
I'm so...

3291
03:47:41,960 --> 03:47:42,880
What's over here?

3292
03:47:47,120 --> 03:47:47,620
Oh no!

3293
03:47:49,280 --> 03:47:50,860
Well it is over here.

3294
03:48:01,060 --> 03:48:02,820
I hate these, I hate them so much.

3295
03:48:03,200 --> 03:48:03,760
I hate them.

3296
03:48:03,800 --> 03:48:04,800
I don't know which one is.

3297
03:48:05,420 --> 03:48:07,140
I'm so paranoid right now.

3298
03:48:11,270 --> 03:48:12,470
Oh my nice, thank god.

3299
03:48:12,790 --> 03:48:14,630
The Reef of Purity.

3300
03:48:16,350 --> 03:48:17,250
What the fuck is that?

3301
03:48:22,410 --> 03:48:24,450
Oh my god, where's the bench?

3302
03:48:25,490 --> 03:48:27,130
I need a bench.

3303
03:48:28,590 --> 03:48:31,870
Why did they give it to me when I'm so far away?

3304
03:48:43,330 --> 03:48:44,650
Wait, what on the left?

3305
03:48:48,750 --> 03:48:49,590
Oh, this one?

3306
03:48:56,920 --> 03:48:58,520
Oh my god, it's so far.

3307
03:48:58,600 --> 03:49:00,400
Okay, I need to have him take me all the way up.

3308
03:49:14,920 --> 03:49:15,400
Okay.

3309
03:49:22,810 --> 03:49:23,530
Okay.

3310
03:49:26,250 --> 03:49:27,690
Grab me.

3311
03:49:46,340 --> 03:49:48,060
What wall did I have to check?

3312
03:49:49,880 --> 03:49:50,360
Wait.

3313
03:49:51,560 --> 03:49:52,560
Wait, there's a wall?

3314
03:49:53,980 --> 03:49:54,920
Where's the wall?

3315
03:49:58,520 --> 03:50:00,500
Go left on the wall?

3316
03:50:00,800 --> 03:50:01,400
Oh, here?

3317
03:50:01,920 --> 03:50:02,240
Oh!

3318
03:50:03,860 --> 03:50:05,160
Oh, it's just money.

3319
03:50:11,730 --> 03:50:15,150
Okay, at least I have money before I lose it.

3320
03:50:15,150 --> 03:50:15,670
Ah, it's not!

3321
03:50:15,830 --> 03:50:16,990
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

3322
03:50:18,570 --> 03:50:18,930
Okay.

3323
03:50:19,590 --> 03:50:20,210
That's fine.

3324
03:50:21,990 --> 03:50:22,930
Oh, thank God.

3325
03:50:23,030 --> 03:50:23,490
It's a shortcut.

3326
03:50:23,630 --> 03:50:24,210
Oh, thank God.

3327
03:50:24,630 --> 03:50:25,110
Oh, my.

3328
03:50:25,390 --> 03:50:26,110
You know, it's fine.

3329
03:50:26,210 --> 03:50:26,370
It's fine.

3330
03:50:26,410 --> 03:50:27,650
If I die to these guys, it's fine.

3331
03:50:27,910 --> 03:50:28,150
It's fine.

3332
03:50:28,230 --> 03:50:29,050
I'm just so...

3333
03:50:29,050 --> 03:50:29,750
I'm okay.

3334
03:50:30,330 --> 03:50:30,690
I...

3335
03:50:30,690 --> 03:50:31,470
It's okay.

3336
03:50:32,110 --> 03:50:32,470
Okay.

3337
03:50:33,570 --> 03:50:33,930
It's...

3338
03:50:33,930 --> 03:50:35,210
Oh, it's...

3339
03:50:35,210 --> 03:50:36,470
Oh, my God.

3340
03:50:36,750 --> 03:50:37,490
Oh, my God.

3341
03:50:38,950 --> 03:50:41,570
I dodged so much!

3342
03:50:41,910 --> 03:50:43,850
I doubled so much!

3343
03:50:44,290 --> 03:50:44,810
I...

3344
03:50:44,810 --> 03:50:47,090
Oh my god, and I sat down here!

3345
03:50:51,670 --> 03:50:57,070
Holy shit, I dodged everything just to still die.

3346
03:51:01,560 --> 03:51:08,340
I think I went through like actual nine circles of hell right there in that one area.

3347
03:51:11,500 --> 03:51:12,980
Get Eden get Eden.

3348
03:51:13,140 --> 03:51:20,160
Come on get Eden fly fly fly fly get Eden come on come on fly here come on come on That's it.

3349
03:51:20,960 --> 03:51:21,420
That's it.

3350
03:51:24,500 --> 03:51:41,320
Oh My god, I'm so scared actually nice That's all I want All right I'll equip it here What's the anti-magnet?

3351
03:51:41,500 --> 03:51:56,540

3352
03:52:00,880 --> 03:52:09,380

3353
03:52:18,340 --> 03:52:30,980
oh i need a focus for this i hate this parkour.

3354
03:52:31,400 --> 03:52:32,820
This is such a rough parkour.

3355
03:52:33,940 --> 03:52:34,760
I feel like.

3356
03:52:35,820 --> 03:52:37,300
This parkour is pretty rough.

3357
03:52:42,900 --> 03:52:43,500
Oh.

3358
03:52:45,560 --> 03:52:45,980
All right.

3359
03:52:56,610 --> 03:52:58,210
Okay, I made it.

3360
03:52:58,850 --> 03:52:59,490
Get out of here.

3361
03:53:01,610 --> 03:53:02,750
Where does this lead me?

3362
03:53:03,130 --> 03:53:03,750
What is this?

3363
03:53:04,330 --> 03:53:04,950
Oh, I flee.

3364
03:53:06,550 --> 03:53:07,650
What's she doing here?

3365
03:53:08,270 --> 03:53:10,430
Gurb and bug not flee.

3366
03:53:10,970 --> 03:53:12,630
Why you must bother me?

3367
03:53:12,730 --> 03:53:14,970
This spot is mine!

3368
03:53:15,170 --> 03:53:16,630
Fear fought and gurn!

3369
03:53:17,410 --> 03:53:20,350
I won't stay long, madam, nor will I contest your right to this cave.

3370
03:53:20,730 --> 03:53:23,570
I'm kind of sober here, fellow fleas, united in a cavern.

3371
03:53:24,570 --> 03:53:25,870
Perhaps you consider joining with them.

3372
03:53:26,050 --> 03:53:26,310
Yes, Veer.

3373
03:53:26,670 --> 03:53:28,110
Veer seems a hardy hide.

3374
03:53:28,490 --> 03:53:31,110
I feel alone they lack the strength to survive long in this land.

3375
03:53:31,710 --> 03:53:34,470
Caravan, gurn, felt it in my fur.

3376
03:53:35,090 --> 03:53:36,750
Time for strange.

3377
03:53:37,350 --> 03:53:39,710
If Caravan is close, then my task.

3378
03:53:39,910 --> 03:53:41,730
These lands may near be complete.

3379
03:53:42,810 --> 03:53:45,390
Grr, much talk I give.

3380
03:53:45,770 --> 03:53:47,190
You leave me.

3381
03:53:47,630 --> 03:53:51,150
Meet again at Caravan amongst good fellows.

3382
03:53:51,790 --> 03:53:54,950
There I share my learnings of fleas and farloom.

3383
03:53:55,630 --> 03:53:57,810
Till then, rest I need.

3384
03:53:58,170 --> 03:53:59,270
Off bug.

3385
03:54:00,650 --> 03:54:01,110
That's it?

3386
03:54:01,230 --> 03:54:01,690
Sha-cha.

3387
03:54:02,110 --> 03:54:03,050
You still here?

3388
03:54:03,470 --> 03:54:04,450
Bug not flee.

3389
03:54:04,990 --> 03:54:07,570
Is rest I need before I leave for Caravan?

3390
03:54:08,170 --> 03:54:08,850
Not chat.

3391
03:54:09,310 --> 03:54:10,770
You feel trouble type.

3392
03:54:11,110 --> 03:54:12,330
Make my shell tense.

3393
03:54:12,730 --> 03:54:14,130
I shall take my leave, madam.

3394
03:54:14,450 --> 03:54:15,670
Stay trial on your own journey.

3395
03:54:15,930 --> 03:54:17,110
May we meet again a caravan.

3396
03:54:17,570 --> 03:54:20,470
Just because I'm murdered doesn't make me a bad person.

3397
03:54:23,880 --> 03:54:24,400
Alright.

3398
03:54:25,460 --> 03:54:27,700
Now head all the way to the right.

3399
03:54:27,900 --> 03:54:28,740
You mean the left?

3400
03:54:29,260 --> 03:54:30,080
That's my left.

3401
03:54:37,370 --> 03:54:38,490
Down I'll go.

3402
03:54:39,250 --> 03:54:39,850
Oh hey!

3403
03:54:40,190 --> 03:54:40,990
I'm back here.

3404
03:54:43,250 --> 03:54:45,050
Oh you mean the lake part.

3405
03:54:49,420 --> 03:54:51,000
Left then go right.

3406
03:54:52,500 --> 03:54:54,080
Oh, right on the map.

3407
03:54:55,140 --> 03:54:55,140
Okay.

3408
03:54:57,260 --> 03:54:59,120
Look, Sherma wanted love singing.

3409
03:54:59,400 --> 03:55:00,580
I just let her keep...

3410
03:55:00,580 --> 03:55:03,300
She was crying because of how much she loves singing, guys.

3411
03:55:04,000 --> 03:55:05,640
I was just giving her what he wanted.

3412
03:55:07,640 --> 03:55:10,120
Isn't that what Sherma wanted?

3413
03:55:11,680 --> 03:55:13,380
I hate these guys so much.

3414
03:55:16,300 --> 03:55:18,080
He just loved to sing.

3415
03:55:26,020 --> 03:55:28,280
Oh my god, I didn't realize that that was just it.

3416
03:55:28,360 --> 03:55:30,200
I thought I could just swim all the way through.

3417
03:55:40,590 --> 03:55:41,230
Oh shit!

3418
03:55:46,550 --> 03:55:47,670
Okay, right side.

3419
03:55:48,990 --> 03:55:49,970
Oh, it has a limit?

3420
03:55:52,930 --> 03:55:54,090
Oh yeah, what's the limit?

3421
03:55:58,810 --> 03:55:59,130
Hello?

3422
03:55:59,850 --> 03:56:00,310
What's over?

3423
03:56:00,430 --> 03:56:01,910
Oh, I thought that was a chair.

3424
03:56:03,010 --> 03:56:05,430
Guys, I don't know what's a chair and what's not a chair.

3425
03:56:10,670 --> 03:56:11,770
What's this?

3426
03:56:14,970 --> 03:56:17,610
Sisters spiders, watch these waters flow.

3427
03:56:18,150 --> 03:56:19,250
Lensing binding.

3428
03:56:20,090 --> 03:56:22,010
As a silk from shell.

3429
03:56:22,510 --> 03:56:24,750
Memories of our kingdom come.

3430
03:56:25,710 --> 03:56:26,170
Okay.

3431
03:56:28,150 --> 03:56:28,550
Okay.

3432
03:56:29,990 --> 03:56:32,410
Swim, swim, swim, swim.

3433
03:56:33,050 --> 03:56:34,950
Oh my god.

3434
03:56:35,050 --> 03:56:35,850
I'm Michael Phelps.

3435
03:56:37,370 --> 03:56:39,930
Did I just swim right or did I go up?

3436
03:56:40,750 --> 03:56:42,230
Oh, decisions, decisions.

3437
03:56:46,070 --> 03:56:47,590
Actual clean water, yeah.

3438
03:56:49,650 --> 03:56:50,910
But there's nothing here.

3439
03:56:57,490 --> 03:56:57,970
That's it?

3440
03:56:59,270 --> 03:57:00,550
Oh, there's a craft metal.

3441
03:57:01,050 --> 03:57:01,050
Nice.

3442
03:57:05,770 --> 03:57:07,710
I know there's, like, stuff I can craft with it.

3443
03:57:07,770 --> 03:57:11,210
Oh, the little trinket thing.

3444
03:57:13,350 --> 03:57:14,530
We're done here?

3445
03:57:16,490 --> 03:57:18,330
Wait, so what's the point of being here?

3446
03:57:21,210 --> 03:57:22,970
Oh, it's for later use.

3447
03:57:23,150 --> 03:57:24,790
Okay, now go talk to it, please.

3448
03:57:25,750 --> 03:57:25,750
Okay.

3449
03:57:30,720 --> 03:57:31,200
Weeeeee!

3450
03:57:38,460 --> 03:57:39,980
Alright, we gotta go this way.

3451
03:57:42,160 --> 03:57:43,500
Oh my god.

3452
03:57:43,880 --> 03:57:45,680
Get away!

3453
03:57:47,340 --> 03:57:48,180
I'm back!

3454
03:57:48,240 --> 03:57:48,940

I actually went to the slabs.

3467
04:01:28,060 --> 04:01:29,580
Okay, this way.

3468
04:01:32,860 --> 04:01:36,940
Oh my god, I forgot the stupid runback for this area.

3469
04:01:44,340 --> 04:01:46,600
And then it's like...

3470
04:01:50,380 --> 04:01:51,000
Whoops.

3471
04:01:54,240 --> 04:01:54,540
Oopsie.

3472
04:01:56,300 --> 04:01:57,140
They're like...

3473
04:01:57,880 --> 04:02:02,400
I'm trying to remember if there's like any shortcuts that I can do.

3474
04:02:04,040 --> 04:02:04,620
There we go.

3475
04:02:07,260 --> 04:02:08,680
Hey, there they are.

3476
04:02:09,940 --> 04:02:10,500
Nice.

3477
04:02:10,800 --> 04:02:11,940
That was a nice run back.

3478
04:02:13,680 --> 04:02:14,660
Have you met her again?

3479
04:02:14,860 --> 04:02:17,580
Our burly new companion, Vogue!

3480
04:02:17,860 --> 04:02:20,800
Fresh return from a long time spent tracking.

3481
04:02:21,600 --> 04:02:22,880
We have met, flea master.

3482
04:02:23,300 --> 04:02:25,540
It gladdens me that I'm so strong a flea.

3483
04:02:26,100 --> 04:02:26,900
Exists as her.

3484
04:02:28,060 --> 04:02:29,460
Yours was a caravan.

3485
04:02:30,580 --> 04:02:31,800
Sully lacking for protection.

3486
04:02:32,020 --> 04:02:34,660
And I am too bound by my own tasks to provide for you.

3487
04:02:35,180 --> 04:02:37,240
But we would never impose so.

3488
04:02:37,740 --> 04:02:40,000
And now no matter, her scent may be strong.

3489
04:02:40,300 --> 04:02:43,300
Her taste for a brew of bottomless, but her skill is sharp.

3490
04:02:43,720 --> 04:02:47,040
If predators draw close, her talents provide much confidence to her caravan.

3491
04:02:47,640 --> 04:02:48,680
Honestly, you just said this guy.

3492
04:02:48,820 --> 04:02:49,220
This guy?

3493
04:02:49,520 --> 04:02:49,680
This?

3494
04:02:51,600 --> 04:02:52,240
this guy.

3495
04:02:52,500 --> 04:02:53,620
Like, he could just sit on him.

3496
04:02:54,960 --> 04:02:56,620
Bro, he's bigger than this flea.

3497
04:02:59,180 --> 04:03:00,240
The Saint Bernard.

3498
04:03:02,820 --> 04:03:06,200
The Saint Bernard is bigger than this flea.

3499
04:03:08,860 --> 04:03:11,080
Very greetings again, large flea.

3500
04:03:11,620 --> 04:03:16,000
Amongst all of your trope, I little doubt you have survived to reach this caravan.

3501
04:03:16,860 --> 04:03:20,920
Would you tell me now the texts that saw you so apart from your fellows and so fearsome in form?

3502
04:03:21,800 --> 04:03:23,580
Grr, bug not flee.

3503
04:03:24,060 --> 04:03:27,640
Mine is to track by trail and smell, and sense is sharp.

3504
04:03:28,040 --> 04:03:29,700
Find our flea friend fleas.

3505
04:03:29,960 --> 04:03:34,160
Our young, most of most, to bring them together and grow them strong.

3506
04:03:35,120 --> 04:03:38,260
If you have sense of location of utter lost fleas, share them with me.

3507
04:03:38,560 --> 04:03:40,160
I may be able to send them safe to the care bed.

3508
04:03:40,640 --> 04:03:41,800
My learnings?

3509
04:03:41,960 --> 04:03:43,220
Not free for you.

3510
04:03:43,560 --> 04:03:44,760
Bug not flee.

3511
04:03:45,460 --> 04:03:46,020
Rosaries.

3512
04:03:46,620 --> 04:03:49,740
Give those, and I shall save what I have since.

3513
04:03:50,100 --> 04:03:51,040
Work like mine.

3514
04:03:51,600 --> 04:03:52,680
long and hard.

3515
04:03:53,020 --> 04:03:56,000
And for that, I deserve some riches held.

3516
04:03:56,700 --> 04:03:56,940
Alright.

3517
04:03:59,160 --> 04:04:01,140
Um, we'll do the cheapest one.

3518
04:04:02,840 --> 04:04:04,260
I ain't made out money.

3519
04:04:05,220 --> 04:04:06,020
Wait, Bone Lands?

3520
04:04:07,360 --> 04:04:09,940
Uh, I mean, there's more in Bone Lands.

3521
04:04:10,080 --> 04:04:15,800
I swear to God, if if I pay $150 and there's nothing there, I swear to God.

3522
04:04:19,200 --> 04:04:19,800
Alright.

3523
04:04:20,300 --> 04:04:22,020
I have marked your map bug.

3524
04:04:22,740 --> 04:04:24,980
See the learnings of fleas lost across land.

I got curious.

3562
04:07:44,540 --> 04:07:45,680
I want to know what's over there.

3563
04:07:46,380 --> 04:07:47,300

3564
04:07:48,220 --> 04:07:49,000

If I never check, then I know they're safe.

3650
04:14:13,800 --> 04:14:17,440
If you never check, then you never know if they're safe or not.

3651
04:14:19,520 --> 04:14:21,400
I like to believe that they're safe.

3652
04:14:23,120 --> 04:14:24,620

04:15:25,010 --> 04:15:27,290
Okay, now see this...

I'll just kill you for money.

3661
04:15:38,980 --> 04:15:42,060
See, look, that's a flea that needed to be saved.

3662
04:15:42,920 --> 04:15:46,040
Unlike the other fleas that were just fucking sleeping.

3663
04:15:48,280 --> 04:15:49,820
Oh yeah, oh there it is.

3664
04:15:55,500 --> 04:15:57,400

04:16:10,580 --> 04:16:11,340
Oh shit.

3669
04:16:13,780 --> 04:16:14,880
We gotta go this way.

3670
04:16:18,200 --> 04:16:20,220
Mass charge in the area I did not see.

3671
04:16:20,240 --> 04:16:21,220
Explore?

3672
04:16:21,440 --> 04:16:21,560
Which?

3673
04:16:21,680 --> 04:16:22,260
This one?

3674
04:16:28,490 --> 04:16:29,810
Where is it?

3675
04:16:31,410 --> 04:16:32,430
Oh, this?

3676
04:16:36,530 --> 04:16:37,930
I'll do that later.

3677
04:16:42,290 --> 04:16:44,130
I'll grab the other.

3678
04:16:44,410 --> 04:16:45,770
I won't grab the other one.

3679
04:16:50,920 --> 04:16:53,940
I want to grab all the...

3680
04:16:55,860 --> 04:17:06,740
Grab all the fleas for because I feel like the fleas are the most frustrating part in general because it's literally just a fetch quest

3681
04:17:10,020 --> 04:17:19,160
she's never returning is she no no I'll be back I'll be back I swear I'll be back guys and then she never came back

don't worry guys I'll be back I'll be back

3683
04:17:29,140 --> 04:17:31,500
Okay, the flea should be here, right?

3684
04:17:35,000 --> 04:17:35,600
Hello?

3685
04:17:37,900 --> 04:17:39,180
Does the flea live here?

3686
04:17:40,740 --> 04:17:41,660
Oh, shit.

3687
04:17:41,940 --> 04:17:42,220
It's here.

3688
04:17:42,540 --> 04:17:43,300
Oh, fuck!

3689
04:17:44,680 --> 04:17:47,220
Oh my god, I didn't bring the magma.

3690
04:17:50,060 --> 04:17:51,820
Oh god, it's so loud.

3691
04:17:54,000 --> 04:17:55,000
Oh no.

3692
04:18:01,090 --> 04:18:02,930
Oh, why didn't I bring the...

3693
04:18:02,930 --> 04:18:05,770
Why didn't I bring magma to the magma room?

3694
04:18:11,290 --> 04:18:12,210
That's right.

3695
04:18:18,450 --> 04:18:20,430
Is there like...

3696
04:18:20,430 --> 04:18:22,310
Wait, is there like a thing up here?

3697
04:18:22,870 --> 04:18:23,610

All they do is just go...

3716
04:19:59,160 --> 04:20:03,680
You don't need, like, 20 guardsmen for one flea.

3717
04:20:04,700 --> 04:20:08,140
And, Debbie, and that's exactly why they're valued.

3718
04:20:10,940 --> 04:20:13,460
You need more than that.

3719
04:20:15,780 --> 04:20:16,180

3737
04:21:36,700 --> 04:21:38,580
It's so dark, too.

3738
04:21:39,740 --> 04:21:41,640
I don't have poison.

3739
04:21:42,560 --> 04:21:43,640

3740
04:21:43,640 --> 04:21:45,460

3747
04:22:15,630 --> 04:22:17,350
It's the team dog.

3748
04:22:18,170 --> 04:22:18,770
Yeah,

3749
04:22:28,080 --> 04:22:29,240

04:24:23,920 --> 04:24:24,960
Hey, where is this area?

3782
04:24:25,080 --> 04:24:25,300
Okay.

3783
04:24:26,700 --> 04:24:28,100
The other left.

04:24:34,340 --> 04:24:37,720
Okay, I don't know what this is, I'm going down just to check it out.

3785
04:24:40,300 --> 04:24:41,180
Let's hang out.

04:24:53,120 --> 04:24:54,260
Is there a mashard here?

3790
04:24:54,940 --> 04:24:55,660

3791
04:24:57,500 --> 04:24:58,000

3792
04:25:02,320 --> 04:25:04,660

3793
04:25:05,360 --> 04:25:06,220
Oh, peace God.

3794
04:25:06,960 --> 04:25:07,680
Wait, that's it?

3795
04:25:09,540 --> 04:25:11,600
He just poofed away?

3796
04:25:12,340 --> 04:25:13,680
Just like that?

3797
04:25:16,040 --> 04:25:17,380
What does this do?

3798
04:25:20,160 --> 04:25:21,760
I go out!

3799
04:25:22,120 --> 04:25:23,640
I don't even know where he went!

3800
04:25:26,900 --> 04:25:27,700
What's this?

3801
04:25:34,280 --> 04:25:34,920

04:25:51,960 --> 04:25:52,460
Oh, oh.

3809
04:25:52,460 --> 04:25:54,340
They added some things in my shortcut.

3810
04:25:57,840 --> 04:26:00,060
Okay, actually, it's good that we have shards.

3811
04:26:02,240 --> 04:26:06,000
They added some slugs in my shortcut for some reason.

3812
04:26:08,500 --> 04:26:10,260
Okay, now we go this way.

3813
04:26:12,340 --> 04:26:13,180
There's another shortcut.

3814
04:26:14,440 --> 04:26:15,180
We're open.

3815
04:26:15,200 --> 04:26:18,120
How does this go?

3816
04:26:20,220 --> 04:26:23,900

3817
04:26:26,800 --> 04:26:27,400

3822
04:26:52,460 --> 04:26:54,520

3851
04:30:57,050 --> 04:30:58,190

3852
04:30:58,350 --> 04:30:59,970
I barely had my weapon.

3853
04:31:00,130 --> 04:31:00,850
What do you mean?

3854
04:31:02,490 --> 04:31:04,910

Oh, is this Asana?

3858
04:31:21,400 --> 04:31:21,960
Okay.

3859
04:31:23,020 --> 04:31:30,040
I just have the needle, a chainsaw, a boomerang, the ability to heal my wounds, and a charm that protects against fire.

3860
04:31:31,340 --> 04:31:32,180
Yeah, and?

3861
04:31:33,080 --> 04:31:35,020
Yeah, but he has lava.

3862
04:31:35,980 --> 04:31:37,180
It's not fair.

3863
04:31:42,660 --> 04:31:44,940
Yeah, but I didn't do call a friend.

3864
04:31:46,520 --> 04:31:47,580
Oh, my God.

3865
04:31:48,720 --> 04:31:51,840
At least I was a pussy and called a friend.

3866
04:31:54,440 --> 04:31:56,320
Oh, wait, that's a big slug.

3867
04:31:57,480 --> 04:31:59,420
Have you killed a big slug?

3868
04:31:59,860 --> 04:32:00,060

04:32:03,160 --> 04:32:03,860
I'm not sure.

3870
04:32:04,000 --> 04:32:05,400
I'm just gonna kill it just because I can.

3871
04:32:12,050 --> 04:32:14,650
When you don't know what to do, just kill it.

3872
04:32:17,430 --> 04:32:19,190
It just seemed dangerous.

3873
04:32:19,530 --> 04:32:20,090
I don't know.

3874
04:32:20,690 --> 04:32:21,310
Oh, my God.

3875
04:32:22,290 --> 04:32:24,030
Of course I died there.

3876
04:32:29,000 --> 04:32:30,500
Are you serious?

3877
04:32:38,540 --> 04:32:40,280
Wait, what's over to my left though?

3878
04:32:45,160 --> 04:32:47,280
Oh my god, his range is crazy.

3879
04:32:48,760 --> 04:32:49,240
Is there anything here?

3880
04:32:50,900 --> 04:32:51,460
No?

3881
04:32:51,680 --> 04:32:53,200
Oh, it's just absolutely nothing.

3882
04:32:54,800 --> 04:32:57,280
I love it when it's absolutely nothing.

3883
04:32:57,800 --> 04:32:57,800
Oh!

3884
04:33:03,500 --> 04:33:05,120
All right, okay, I deserve that.

3885
04:33:05,600 --> 04:33:06,660
That was very stupid.

3886
04:33:09,760 --> 04:33:11,320
Hey, what's over here?

3887
04:33:14,480 --> 04:33:18,400
Wait, there's like two secret areas, but which one is the secret area I have to go?

3888
04:33:26,540 --> 04:33:28,260
Okay, I didn't realize he was that thick.

3889
04:33:34,000 --> 04:33:35,080
There we go.

3890
04:33:41,710 --> 04:33:43,470
Okay, I deserve that.

3891
04:33:44,090 --> 04:33:45,510
I deserve that.

3892
04:33:46,190 --> 04:33:48,870
I have to go through all this goddamn slug skin.

3893
04:33:50,430 --> 04:33:51,770
Oh my god.

3894
04:33:52,450 --> 04:33:54,370
But like, what was the other secret?

3895
04:33:54,450 --> 04:33:56,250
You guys saw that other secret area, right?

3896
04:33:56,650 --> 04:33:58,090
I'm like a little confused.

3897
04:33:58,250 --> 04:33:59,250
Where does that go to?

3898
04:34:08,170 --> 04:34:09,390
I forgot about him.

3899
04:34:10,350 --> 04:34:11,450
I forgot about the spikes.

3900
04:34:21,020 --> 04:34:22,220
Oh, it's this!

3901
04:34:22,560 --> 04:34:23,800
Oh my god, I could grab that.

3902
04:34:24,560 --> 04:34:26,080
Oh, it was just a beast shard.

3903
04:34:26,280 --> 04:34:27,360
It's not even that important.

3904
04:34:29,420 --> 04:34:30,480
Wait, he's on!

3905
04:34:31,760 --> 04:34:32,940
Oh, it's fine.

3906
04:34:33,080 --> 04:34:33,460
It's fine.

3907
04:34:33,820 --> 04:34:37,940
It's fine Because I know we had this

3908
04:34:41,450 --> 04:34:43,130

3914
04:35:17,170 --> 04:35:18,630
By an Ornid champ.

3915
04:35:19,210 --> 04:35:20,250
How do I open this?

3916
04:35:22,370 --> 04:35:22,650
What?

3917
04:35:25,390 --> 04:35:26,650
Oh, for later?

3918
04:35:27,490 --> 04:35:29,550
Oh, it's for area three.

3919
04:35:29,870 --> 04:35:30,150

Oh, I already thought I opened this already.

04:35:44,360 --> 04:35:45,560
Okay, now we go.

3925
04:35:50,000 --> 04:35:51,820
Okay, I've been here.

3926
04:35:51,960 --> 04:35:52,920
I've been there.

3927
04:35:53,580 --> 04:35:55,020
We go to chair.

3928
04:35:56,780 --> 04:35:57,700
Jesus Christ.

3929
04:35:59,900 --> 04:36:02,780
I'm not happy about this place.

3930
04:36:05,060 --> 04:36:09,240
I need to figure out how to get out of here.

3931
04:36:09,960 --> 04:36:12,700
A broken wall.

3932
04:36:15,740 --> 04:36:16,820
I miss it?

3933
04:36:19,180 --> 04:36:20,360
Oh, here.

3934
04:36:22,200 --> 04:36:23,020
There it is.

3935
04:36:23,840 --> 04:36:24,940
Now where am I?

3936
04:36:33,200 --> 04:36:34,700
Down I'll go.

3937
04:36:35,900 --> 04:36:36,540
Down I go.

3938
04:36:38,280 --> 04:36:39,360
Down I go.

3939
04:36:40,380 --> 04:36:41,020

04:37:41,260 --> 04:37:42,240
Finish the area?

3946
04:37:42,580 --> 04:37:45,340
I'm pretty sure if... Okay, there's that area, but I don't think that's that important.

3947
04:37:49,270 --> 04:37:50,990
The nook above here?

3948
04:38:00,740 --> 04:38:01,320
Is it here?

3949
04:38:09,220 --> 04:38:10,480
There's a tool there?

3950
04:38:10,680 --> 04:38:12,220
But is it a good tool?

3951
04:38:16,770 --> 04:38:19,530
I mean, I assume this is from here.

3952
04:38:25,400 --> 04:38:26,160
What's the tool?

3953
04:38:27,280 --> 04:38:27,680
Maybe.

3954
04:38:28,100 --> 04:38:28,760
Okay, guys.

3955
04:38:29,560 --> 04:38:32,080
Is it a yes or no answer?

3956
04:38:32,680 --> 04:38:34,520
Will I use the tool?

3957
04:38:37,900 --> 04:38:41,740
But is it a tool that I will use?

3958
04:38:42,320 --> 04:38:42,940
Perhaps.

3959
04:38:46,260 --> 04:38:47,860
A yesent.

3960
04:38:49,160 --> 04:38:49,180
Okay.

3961
04:38:53,720 --> 04:38:54,740
Probably not.

3962
04:39:02,820 --> 04:39:05,740
Tools are for collecting, not for using.

3963
04:39:06,160 --> 04:39:07,200
Alright, I guess we leave.

3964
04:39:08,240 --> 04:39:10,000
I guess there's no good tool.

3965
04:39:10,220 --> 04:39:12,080
There's nothing else I have to get.

3966
04:39:12,840 --> 04:39:14,280
So it's leaving time.

3967
04:39:15,240 --> 04:39:17,280
Oh my god, this stupid fucking platform.

3968
04:39:22,270 --> 04:39:24,590
It's a boost tool, like a range thing.

3969
04:39:25,890 --> 04:39:26,430
Hmm.

3970
04:39:27,830 --> 04:39:28,510
Hmm.

3971
04:39:28,610 --> 04:39:29,050
Hmm.

3972
04:39:33,480 --> 04:39:35,800
Alright, I'll go grab it.

3973
04:39:39,550 --> 04:39:39,870
Oh.

3974
04:39:41,670 --> 04:39:42,810
It's awkward.

3975
04:39:45,950 --> 04:39:46,970
Whop, alright.

3976
04:39:50,630 --> 04:39:51,010
That's...

3977
04:39:51,390 --> 04:39:52,190
That's awkward.

3978
04:39:52,570 --> 04:39:53,970
I forgot about that.

3979
04:39:54,950 --> 04:39:55,810
Ring, ring, ring.

3980
04:40:00,780 --> 04:40:01,840
Why did I talk to her?

3981
04:40:04,220 --> 04:40:05,480
How did you come to search?

3982
04:40:05,500 --> 04:40:07,480
of these dogs, Forge Doctor.

3983
04:40:08,000 --> 04:40:12,760
Hands from thy fraud, churning away, I request to those holy bugs above.

3984
04:40:13,120 --> 04:40:15,980
The Soda dwellers, the veiled bugs, they ordered you here?

3985
04:40:16,300 --> 04:40:26,640
Yes, and age ago that such is duty before its daughters lived to hone the craft and ain't the line.

3986
04:40:27,360 --> 04:40:55,300
I the Soda Thel's patronage and our long duty upon these dogs our Forge corn was swelling Holy esteem Oh nice, good for you Oh, I don't have anything to buy from here Oh Yeah, that's her voice I love That's actually her voice It's canon I love you Also,

3989
04:41:15,060 --> 04:41:16,900
And thus it has become canon.

3990
04:41:22,220 --> 04:41:22,480
Yay!

3991
04:41:23,520 --> 04:41:25,160
Here we go, this way.

3992
04:41:33,190 --> 04:41:34,610
Okay, we gotta...

3993
04:41:35,490 --> 04:41:36,530
Well, I'll go up.

3994
04:41:37,510 --> 04:41:39,130
How to go up.

3995
04:41:40,490 --> 04:41:41,730
Up we go.

3996
04:41:42,170 --> 04:41:43,590
Wait, is there like an entrance here?

3997
04:41:43,610 --> 04:41:43,870
here?

3998
04:41:44,370 --> 04:41:45,190
I don't remember.

3999
04:41:48,790 --> 04:41:49,950
I don't think so.

4000
04:41:50,930 --> 04:41:52,250
Oh, we have to go on the other side.

4001
04:41:52,470 --> 04:41:52,650
Yeah.

4002
04:41:58,120 --> 04:41:58,600
Okay.

4003
04:41:58,900 --> 04:42:00,180
Oh my god, not the scissors.

4004
04:42:04,480 --> 04:42:04,840
Okay.

4005
04:42:05,020 --> 04:42:05,840
And then...

4006
04:42:10,220 --> 04:42:11,960
I'm still going up.

4007
04:42:12,260 --> 04:42:13,280
Where is this flea?

4008
04:42:15,960 --> 04:42:16,960
Oh my god.

4009
04:42:17,080 --> 04:42:17,780
He's sleeping.

4010
04:42:21,600 --> 04:42:22,360
Oh my god.

4011
04:42:22,460 --> 04:42:23,380
How about get up there.

4012
04:42:25,320 --> 04:42:26,600
How are you just locked?

4013
04:42:26,780 --> 04:42:27,420

04:42:27,740 --> 04:42:27,740
Okay.

04:42:28,820 --> 04:42:29,920
How do we get up there?

4016
04:42:30,540 --> 04:42:33,080
He's locked behind cage for his crimes.

4017
04:42:35,600 --> 04:42:36,640
The other side.

4018
04:42:36,840 --> 04:42:40,080
Where the fuck is the other side?

Did you miss this, right?

04:43:12,500 --> 04:43:13,860
Why did I open?

4026
04:43:15,240 --> 04:43:16,920
Oh my god, I forgot he could do that.

4027
04:43:18,280 --> 04:43:20,140
I forgot this freak can do that.

4028
04:43:27,050 --> 04:43:27,410
Okay.

04:58:03,250 --> 04:58:03,830
Okay.

4242
04:58:07,490 --> 04:58:08,130
Alright.

4243
04:58:08,850 --> 04:58:09,410
It's time.

4244
04:58:13,580 --> 04:58:15,780
Oh, he forces me.

4245
04:58:15,920 --> 04:58:16,680
Oh, I could have.

4246
04:58:17,600 --> 04:58:17,820
Okay.

4247
04:58:23,670 --> 04:58:25,150
There we go.

4248
04:58:27,870 --> 04:58:31,810
Wow, this feels a lot easier now.

4249
04:58:36,210 --> 04:58:38,590
Who would have thought?

4250
04:58:39,670 --> 04:58:46,820
I wish I did that sooner.

4251
04:58:51,000 --> 04:58:52,760
Way easy.

4252
04:59:06,570 --> 04:59:07,530
Oh, fuck it.

4253
04:59:08,070 --> 04:59:08,790
There you go.

4254
04:59:10,090 --> 04:59:11,270
Oh my, there you go.

4255
04:59:11,410 --> 04:59:13,350
It's easy.

4256
04:59:14,890 --> 04:59:16,970
Laugh live the Pokemon.

4257
04:59:18,470 --> 04:59:19,650
Who would have thought?

4258
04:59:22,090 --> 04:59:24,010
The Whispire Lantern.

4259
04:59:26,890 --> 04:59:28,750
Who would have thought?

4260
04:59:31,690 --> 04:59:34,770
Oh my god, where the fuck is the flea?

4261
04:59:36,050 --> 04:59:37,430
No more fight.

4262
04:59:40,030 --> 04:59:42,770
How do I even...

4263
04:59:44,910 --> 04:59:47,250
Congratulations, he got one of the wish...

4264
04:59:47,250 --> 04:59:48,950
I came here for the flea!

4265
04:59:49,070 --> 04:59:49,910
Where is he?

4266
04:59:50,950 --> 04:59:53,510
Oh, he's in the bag of rosary.

4267
04:59:53,690 --> 04:59:53,970
Okay.

4268
04:59:55,670 --> 04:59:58,530
I was gonna... I was like, where the fuck...

4269
04:59:59,610 --> 05:00:02,470
You don't have firepower anymore.

4270
05:00:04,030 --> 05:00:06,090
Wait, he just became fire.

4271
05:00:06,890 --> 05:00:07,850
What happened?

4272
05:00:11,630 --> 05:00:13,070
What happened?

4273
05:00:14,350 --> 05:00:17,970
I was like, haha, I got you now.

4274
05:00:19,030 --> 05:00:20,630
And he's gone forever.

4275
05:00:21,790 --> 05:00:23,790
Okay, but this still works though.

4276
05:00:24,810 --> 05:00:26,010
Like fuck me.

4277
05:00:26,150 --> 05:00:27,190
Okay, this still works.

4278
05:00:32,150 --> 05:00:34,730
Okay, this should not still work though.

4279
05:00:36,170 --> 05:00:37,690
Oh god, I'm hitting by my...

4280
05:00:37,690 --> 05:00:40,370
I'm actually hitting by my thread right now.

4281
05:00:42,990 --> 05:00:44,270
Oh, right here.

4282
05:00:46,070 --> 05:00:47,330
By my silk thread.

4283
05:00:47,570 --> 05:00:47,730
Haha!

4284
05:00:57,530 --> 05:00:58,030
Okay.

4285
05:01:02,790 --> 05:01:03,310
Oh, yo.

4286
05:01:04,650 --> 05:01:06,510
I would like my craft metal.

4287
05:01:09,150 --> 05:01:12,570
Alright, so where is...

4288
05:01:14,980 --> 05:01:16,400
Break wall on the left?

4289
05:01:18,240 --> 05:01:19,560
Like far left?

4290
05:01:24,310 --> 05:01:27,890
Just want to be sure in case you guys got confused where left is.

4291
05:01:28,970 --> 05:01:30,170
I wanted to be sure.

4292
05:01:30,550 --> 05:01:31,390
Oh, this one.

4293
05:01:32,230 --> 05:01:33,010
I wasn't sure.

4294
05:01:33,250 --> 05:01:35,690
See, some of you guys might be directionally challenged.

4295
05:01:36,010 --> 05:01:36,130
Oh!

4296
05:01:46,270 --> 05:01:46,870
Okay.

4297
05:01:48,870 --> 05:01:49,470
Alright.

4298
05:01:56,850 --> 05:01:59,010
All right, let's go back.

4299
05:02:06,610 --> 05:02:07,170
Where is that?

4300
05:02:07,330 --> 05:02:09,370
Oh my god, okay, whatever.

4301
05:02:16,270 --> 05:02:17,110
There you go.

4302
05:02:18,190 --> 05:02:19,410
Where's my fucking silk?

4303
05:02:20,530 --> 05:02:21,810
Why is it over here?

4304
05:02:23,170 --> 05:02:23,730
Cren.

4305
05:02:27,430 --> 05:02:27,990
All right.

4306
05:02:29,210 --> 05:02:30,090
Use a little fucker.

4307
05:02:32,530 --> 05:02:33,230
This is this way?

4308
05:02:39,010 --> 05:02:40,010
Wait, what?

4309
05:02:40,830 --> 05:02:42,270
What's down here, though?

4310
05:02:43,390 --> 05:02:44,330
Yeah, I can see it.

4311
05:02:44,390 --> 05:02:45,130
There's something here.

4312
05:02:45,750 --> 05:02:46,450
Oh, it's just shards.

4313
05:02:47,710 --> 05:02:48,650
That's fine.

4314
05:02:49,270 --> 05:02:50,430
I need shards anyway.

4315
05:02:55,720 --> 05:02:56,920
Just fine.

4316
05:02:58,560 --> 05:02:59,200
Alright.

4317
05:03:02,530 --> 05:03:05,170
We're still trying to find this one flea.

4318
05:03:06,550 --> 05:03:07,950
Wherever he is.

4319
05:03:09,230 --> 05:03:10,590
Oh my god, you know.

4320
05:03:11,730 --> 05:03:14,330
Oh my god, no.

4321
05:03:15,290 --> 05:03:17,490
Oh my god, no.

4322
05:03:20,550 --> 05:03:21,130
Okay.

4323
05:03:22,630 --> 05:03:24,730
Um, I need a...

4324
05:03:26,670 --> 05:03:27,110
Okay.

4325
05:03:27,910 --> 05:03:28,410
Okay.

4326
05:03:31,870 --> 05:03:32,410
Okay.

4327
05:03:33,170 --> 05:03:33,290
Okay.

4328
05:03:38,130 --> 05:03:41,050
What am I looking at?

4329
05:03:46,210 --> 05:03:48,370
I was trying to dash.

4330
05:03:48,410 --> 05:03:49,650
Oh, I still made it.

4331
05:03:49,670 --> 05:03:50,090
Speedrun.

4332
05:03:52,370 --> 05:03:53,330
I don't know.

4333
05:03:55,810 --> 05:03:56,830
I don't know.

4334
05:03:57,390 --> 05:03:58,810
I don't know.

4335
05:04:01,130 --> 05:04:03,090
I'm so scared.

4336
05:04:09,100 --> 05:04:15,870
I wonder what happened.

4337
05:04:21,770 --> 05:04:23,770
Now I found real hell.

4338
05:04:31,320 --> 05:04:33,880
Oh god, this runback fucking sucked.

4339
05:04:34,320 --> 05:04:35,400
You know what's even worse?

4340
05:04:35,520 --> 05:04:42,160
I feel like there's a fleet that's easier to get than doing this.

4341
05:04:42,980 --> 05:04:46,580
There must be a fleet that is easier to get than this fucker.

4342
05:04:55,130 --> 05:04:55,370
Oh.

4343
05:04:58,740 --> 05:05:00,740
Oh, I went the wrong way.

4344
05:05:04,700 --> 05:05:05,300
Okay.

4345
05:05:07,720 --> 05:05:10,080
I don't remember how I did this.

4346
05:05:18,870 --> 05:05:21,850
Will you not die for him?

4347
05:05:24,850 --> 05:05:25,070
Okay.

4348
05:05:29,840 --> 05:05:30,620
I hesitated.

4349
05:05:31,240 --> 05:05:32,760
I fucking hesitated.

4350
05:05:33,840 --> 05:05:35,460
I hesitated again.

4351
05:05:47,390 --> 05:05:48,750
Oh my god, I hear him.

4352
05:05:49,970 --> 05:05:51,550
Get out of here, you fat fuck.

4353
05:05:52,190 --> 05:05:54,470
Oh my god.

4354
05:05:54,810 --> 05:05:57,930
You goddamn fat fuck.

4355
05:06:08,070 --> 05:06:09,290
Just kill him because I can.

4356
05:06:10,510 --> 05:06:11,710
And I need this.

4357
05:06:14,010 --> 05:06:15,050
Door open.

4358
05:06:16,890 --> 05:06:18,450
Okay, now where am I?

4359
05:06:18,910 --> 05:06:20,950
Now where is this place?

4360
05:06:22,810 --> 05:06:24,490
What the fuck?

4361
05:06:29,690 --> 05:06:31,430
What is this place for?

4362
05:06:35,750 --> 05:06:36,590
What?

4363
05:06:39,310 --> 05:06:40,930
A shortcut to where?

4364
05:06:45,910 --> 05:06:46,930
Oh, this!

4365
05:06:47,090 --> 05:06:49,270
I was like, where is this leading me to?

4366
05:06:49,510 --> 05:06:50,210
Oh, oh, oh.

4367
05:06:53,050 --> 05:06:54,630
Oh, there we go.

4368
05:06:54,910 --> 05:06:55,830
I was so confused.

4369
05:06:56,250 --> 05:06:57,210
Oh, wait, am I in a citadel?

4370
05:06:58,310 --> 05:06:59,090
Wait, I am.

4371
05:07:01,050 --> 05:07:02,690
I'm at the underworks.

4372
05:07:07,700 --> 05:07:07,980
Okay.

4373
05:07:11,570 --> 05:07:12,130
Alright.

4374
05:07:15,410 --> 05:07:17,050
I'm back in super capitalism.

4375
05:07:18,150 --> 05:07:19,530
Alright, I got all the fleas there.

4376
05:07:19,650 --> 05:07:20,890
Okay, we still need that fleas.

4377
05:07:21,110 --> 05:07:22,610
So I didn't go back to Graymore.

4378
05:07:23,390 --> 05:07:25,750
And after that...

4379
05:07:25,750 --> 05:07:27,270
Wait, how many fleas am I missing?

4380
05:07:27,710 --> 05:07:28,030
Chat.

4381
05:07:28,350 --> 05:07:29,370
How many more do I need to get?

4382
05:07:45,670 --> 05:07:47,470
Someone said I had, like, four more?

4383
05:07:47,650 --> 05:07:48,930
Okay, that's doable.

4384
05:07:50,150 --> 05:07:50,950
Door open.

4385
05:08:00,540 --> 05:08:00,760
Okay.

4386
05:08:02,280 --> 05:08:03,080
Door open.

4387
05:08:03,920 --> 05:08:05,020

4391
05:09:13,050 --> 05:09:20,410

4392
05:09:24,790 --> 05:09:29,150
Yeah, but I want to grab the minimum requirement first, and then we can...

4393
05:09:30,190 --> 05:09:31,410
Okay, I need...

4394
05:09:31,410 --> 05:09:33,990
And then we'll look at grabbing all the fleas later.

4395
05:09:34,250 --> 05:09:39,710
I just want to grab the minimum requirement for Act 3 before we do another stream.

4396
05:09:46,430 --> 05:09:49,050
It's just like a goal before I end stream today.

4397
05:09:51,830 --> 05:09:52,310
Alright.

4398
05:09:52,590 --> 05:09:54,150
Wait, how do I get to this corner?

4399
05:09:54,810 --> 05:09:56,990
So how do I get this flea here?

4400
05:09:57,930 --> 05:09:58,830
Is it through this door?

4401
05:09:59,410 --> 05:10:00,130
Oh, it's this door.

4402
05:10:03,790 --> 05:10:04,230
Come on.

4403
05:10:04,990 --> 05:10:06,430
Hey, who's that?

4404
05:10:06,850 --> 05:10:07,170
Hello?

4405
05:10:08,550 --> 05:10:09,870
Oh, wait, there's a flea!

4406
05:10:09,990 --> 05:10:11,530
Wait, there's a grown-up dog!

4407
05:10:13,030 --> 05:10:14,230
You're not a dog?

4408
05:10:14,850 --> 05:10:15,730
Who are you?

4409
05:10:18,210 --> 05:10:22,570
What a turn for a dear crowd to be strung up in such a dark little thing.

4410
05:10:22,590 --> 05:10:23,470
little cave.

4411
05:10:24,550 --> 05:10:27,430
Curse threads stretched throughout the land, such as shared unwearied.

4412
05:10:27,930 --> 05:10:30,010
You seem no worse for now at least.

4413
05:10:31,750 --> 05:10:34,010
That metal carriage, it is yours, I assume.

4414
05:10:34,610 --> 05:10:35,670
Yes, yes.

4415
05:10:36,010 --> 05:10:39,730
I'm setting out to join the nearest flea caravan, aren't I?

4416
05:10:40,070 --> 05:10:41,450
Safety in numbers, yes.

4417
05:10:41,710 --> 05:10:43,910
I'm more than enough of venturing alone.

4418
05:10:46,270 --> 05:10:48,510
And you, I trust I will see you there.

4419
05:10:48,930 --> 05:10:50,830
My carriage hides a special secret.

4420
05:10:51,190 --> 05:10:53,210
I'll gladly share with you when we next meet.

4421
05:10:53,990 --> 05:10:55,850
I'm getting some creepy vibes off of him.

4422
05:10:56,030 --> 05:10:57,810
He even has, like, the creep mustache, you know?

4423
05:10:59,830 --> 05:11:01,570
He has that creepy mustache.

4424
05:11:03,250 --> 05:11:04,710
Good luck, my dear.

4425
05:11:05,050 --> 05:11:05,530

05:11:10,550 --> 05:11:12,310
Yeah, he feels a little creepy.

4430
05:11:12,730 --> 05:11:13,950
The way he said that.

4431
05:11:14,010 --> 05:11:15,550
And he's, like, rubbing his hands, too.

4432
05:11:15,630 --> 05:11:16,930
Like, that's just full-on.

4433
05:11:18,690 --> 05:11:20,190

Actually, we'll grab that for now.

4441
05:12:08,180 --> 05:12:10,820
Well, we can change back to our normal crest.

4442
05:12:11,460 --> 05:12:11,880
Unless...

4443
05:12:11,880 --> 05:12:13,740
I don't think we have any more Pogo's.

4444
05:12:14,060 --> 05:12:14,320

4448
05:12:30,010 --> 05:12:31,030
Oh, this way.

4449
05:12:42,330 --> 05:12:44,230

Okay.

4485
05:15:19,300 --> 05:15:21,440
I thought I had to go outside and hit him.

4486
05:15:22,100 --> 05:15:23,340
Alright, here we go.

4487
05:15:24,280 --> 05:15:25,200
Here we go.

4488
05:15:25,540 --> 05:15:27,020
I gave him another $10.

4489
05:15:29,000 --> 05:15:29,140

4490
05:15:31,140 --> 05:15:31,660

4494
05:15:54,170 --> 05:15:55,190
There we go.

4495
05:15:55,430 --> 05:15:56,230
Get out of here.

4496
05:15:56,550 --> 05:15:57,210

05:15:57,250 --> 05:15:57,670

05:15:58,030 --> 05:15:59,570

05:16:19,030 --> 05:16:21,870
I didn't mean to steal a look five times.

4507
05:16:22,310 --> 05:16:24,510
This old carriage needs constant care.

4508
05:16:24,870 --> 05:16:26,370
I was only doing repairs.

4598
05:23:14,530 --> 05:23:15,950
I hate this area.

4599
05:23:22,310 --> 05:23:23,050
Wait, what?

4600
05:23:23,510 --> 05:23:24,890
How far away is it?

4601
05:23:29,150 --> 05:23:29,990
Just down?

4602
05:23:32,230 --> 05:23:33,950
I think it looks breakable.

4603
05:23:34,130 --> 05:23:34,790
Oh, there it is.

4604
05:23:34,890 --> 05:23:35,830
There is that breakable.

4605
05:23:35,990 --> 05:23:37,250
I was like, nothing looks breakable.

4606
05:23:37,450 --> 05:23:38,890
And then there's a crack right here.

4607
05:23:39,670 --> 05:23:40,470
Are you serious?

4608
05:23:40,710 --> 05:23:41,570
How the fuck?

4609
05:23:46,190 --> 05:23:47,230
How the...

4610
05:23:47,230 --> 05:23:47,690
How?

4611
05:23:50,090 --> 05:23:50,350
How?

4612
05:24:04,050 --> 05:24:05,030
Down still?

4613
05:24:05,170 --> 05:24:06,230
Oh, I did another breakable.

4614
05:24:06,710 --> 05:24:07,130
Oh, okay.

4615
05:24:07,390 --> 05:24:09,230
I was a little worried there.

4616
05:24:09,990 --> 05:24:10,770
Oh, there it is.

4617
05:24:11,810 --> 05:24:14,250
I was like, what am I supposed to do?

4618
05:24:19,410 --> 05:24:20,910
Okay, there we go.

4619
05:24:21,210 --> 05:24:22,210
I was very worried.

4620
05:24:23,710 --> 05:24:24,630
Oh, I can't.

4621
05:24:24,870 --> 05:24:26,330
I thought I would open that door too.

4622
05:24:26,530 --> 05:24:28,530
Oh my god to do this again.

4623
05:24:31,690 --> 05:24:33,690
Thank god he died.

4624
05:24:38,580 --> 05:24:39,820
Wake up!

4625
05:24:39,940 --> 05:24:40,340
Oh!

4626
05:24:43,880 --> 05:24:44,940
Oh, fuck.

4627
05:24:46,220 --> 05:24:48,220
Okay, this one's an easy one at least.

4628
05:24:49,660 --> 05:24:49,960
Alright.

4629
05:24:56,560 --> 05:24:58,180
I wonder if I can... fuck.

4630
05:24:58,860 --> 05:24:59,180
Okay.

4631
05:25:01,840 --> 05:25:02,700
I'm gonna try.

4632
05:25:04,520 --> 05:25:06,060
Okay, yeah, I can still do that.

4633
05:25:06,440 --> 05:25:06,900
Thank God.

4634
05:25:08,260 --> 05:25:09,780
Uh, hi-haus.

4635
05:25:13,510 --> 05:25:13,770
Oh!

4636
05:25:20,930 --> 05:25:25,470
Apparently, everyone uses the Wanderer for, like, speedruns, because it's, like, the fastest.

4637
05:25:27,110 --> 05:25:28,390
But, like, I don't know.

4638
05:25:28,490 --> 05:25:30,570
I'm already so used to the Hunter, Chris.

4639
05:25:32,670 --> 05:25:34,590
I'm just gonna use what I'm comfortable with for now.

4640
05:25:34,850 --> 05:25:36,470
And then down here and up.

4641
05:25:36,590 --> 05:25:36,810
Okay.

4642
05:25:55,170 --> 05:25:56,710
Wait, did I go the wrong elevator?

4643
05:25:57,570 --> 05:25:58,510
I did.

4644
05:25:59,370 --> 05:26:00,170
No, I didn't.

4645
05:26:00,790 --> 05:26:01,350
Okay, down.

4646
05:26:07,140 --> 05:26:07,620
Uh...

4647
05:26:10,240 --> 05:26:11,460
Yeah, oh, and the crit.

4648
05:26:11,600 --> 05:26:13,040
Yeah, I forgot about the crit, too.

4649
05:26:15,500 --> 05:26:16,960
Oh, these marvelous...

4650
05:26:16,960 --> 05:26:18,560
Oh, you're still talking about the supplies.

4651
05:26:18,700 --> 05:26:19,400
Oh, new wish?

4652
05:26:19,860 --> 05:26:20,660
Oh, new wish!

4653
05:26:22,560 --> 05:26:25,900
Horrible cries have been heard from the prison beside the citadel.

4654
05:26:26,500 --> 05:26:29,860
What propanities must be happening within to cause such awful noises?

4655
05:26:30,580 --> 05:26:32,820
All right, so there's something at the citadel.

4656
05:26:35,100 --> 05:26:38,780
Our near mission left to scavenge treasures from them.

4657
05:26:39,220 --> 05:26:39,600
All right.

4658
05:26:44,280 --> 05:26:44,800
All right.

4659
05:26:49,810 --> 05:26:50,850
What's at the slab?

4660
05:26:59,210 --> 05:27:00,130
Do these next stream?

4661
05:27:00,330 --> 05:27:00,750
They're hard.

4662
05:27:01,390 --> 05:27:02,390
All right, we'll just do...

4663
05:27:02,390 --> 05:27:04,390
We'll focus on the fleas then.

4664
05:27:08,370 --> 05:27:09,230
I want to just grab...

4665
05:27:09,230 --> 05:27:11,510
Do as many, like, quests as I can.

4666
05:27:12,550 --> 05:27:13,890
Before we go into...

4667
05:27:13,890 --> 05:27:14,390
No, I want to kill you.

4668
05:27:14,410 --> 05:27:16,170
them, just because I don't care.

4669
05:27:17,490 --> 05:27:18,410
Give me your money.

4670
05:27:26,180 --> 05:27:27,500
Okay, this way.

4671
05:27:28,300 --> 05:27:28,900
Down.

4672
05:27:32,460 --> 05:27:32,680
Alright.

4673
05:27:33,160 --> 05:27:33,880
Here we go.

4674
05:27:35,140 --> 05:27:36,460
Wait, why do I have to go to this lab?

4675
05:27:46,680 --> 05:27:47,500
Gotta figure out.

4676
05:27:53,400 --> 05:27:55,020
Not hard quest?

4677
05:27:57,640 --> 05:27:58,860
Now where do we go?

4678
05:27:59,540 --> 05:28:00,640
Where the fuck is...

4679
05:28:00,640 --> 05:28:00,900
Oh!

4680
05:28:02,620 --> 05:28:03,580
Where is he?

4681
05:28:12,440 --> 05:28:13,900
Did I have to move this?

4682
05:28:17,020 --> 05:28:17,960
Up, right?

4683
05:28:19,860 --> 05:28:21,520
Oh, I have to move that box.

4684
05:28:21,880 --> 05:28:21,900
Okay.

4685
05:28:22,900 --> 05:28:24,500
Yeah, I was like, where the fuck is he?

4686
05:28:25,880 --> 05:28:27,220
Alright, goodbye box.

4687
05:28:28,320 --> 05:28:31,080
Oh my god, I have to move all of this back here.

4688
05:28:35,370 --> 05:28:38,450
Okay, and then we move it from here.

4689
05:28:42,530 --> 05:28:43,850
Up it goes.

4690
05:28:50,210 --> 05:28:50,870
All right.

4691
05:28:52,270 --> 05:28:53,470
Oh, there's a bat here.

4692
05:28:55,130 --> 05:28:57,510
Wait, but where is it?

4693
05:28:58,270 --> 05:28:59,010
Oh, shit!

4694
05:29:02,970 --> 05:29:04,670
Come on, get over here.

4695
05:29:05,170 --> 05:29:06,850
That's right, get out of here.

4696
05:29:07,730 --> 05:29:08,270
Now what?

4697
05:29:08,270 --> 05:29:10,630
Oh, it's on the right side.

4698
05:29:10,850 --> 05:29:11,810
Oh, there he is.

4699
05:29:12,310 --> 05:29:12,770
Alright.

4700
05:29:13,070 --> 05:29:14,330
Be free, child.

4701
05:29:14,810 --> 05:29:14,950
Oh!

4702
05:29:17,900 --> 05:29:18,480
Nice.

4703
05:29:18,700 --> 05:29:19,280
I'm a hero.

4704
05:29:20,480 --> 05:29:20,740
Alright.

4705
05:29:21,040 --> 05:29:23,020
That should be all the fleas.

4706
05:29:24,160 --> 05:29:24,960
Because we counted.

4707
05:29:31,360 --> 05:29:31,940
Yeah.

4708
05:29:32,100 --> 05:29:33,040
Because I...

4709
05:29:33,040 --> 05:29:33,360
Oh.

4710
05:29:33,880 --> 05:29:34,440
Fuck.

4711
05:29:34,720 --> 05:29:34,740
Okay.

4712
05:29:37,380 --> 05:29:39,400
I'm gonna check with the...

4713
05:29:39,400 --> 05:29:41,660
We'll leave him locked up for now.

4714
05:29:45,910 --> 05:29:46,490
Don't.

4715
05:29:46,510 --> 05:29:46,970
Don't worry.

4716
05:29:49,770 --> 05:29:51,510
We saved the minimum amount.

4717
05:29:51,870 --> 05:29:56,230
It's like that Jordan Peele skit where he's like, would you like to donate a daughter to save a child?

4718
05:30:00,190 --> 05:30:02,910
And I'm like, all right, we saved enough children.

4719
05:30:06,810 --> 05:30:07,550
Go, go, go.

4720
05:30:08,870 --> 05:30:10,030
We saved enough kids.

4721
05:30:10,270 --> 05:30:10,690
It's fine.

4722
05:30:20,060 --> 05:30:21,280
Okay, Belle.

4723
05:30:22,200 --> 05:30:23,640
And then...

4724
05:30:24,520 --> 05:30:26,900
A bare minimum achieved.

4725
05:30:28,140 --> 05:30:30,560
Sorry, I only donated enough to save eight kids.

4726
05:30:37,310 --> 05:30:40,510
Okay, they're bad parents if they let 30 fleas.

4727
05:30:41,930 --> 05:30:44,730
They let 30 fleas go missing.

4728
05:30:45,130 --> 05:30:47,710
They're the ones that are bad, bad parents.

4729
05:30:58,150 --> 05:30:58,710
Wee.

4730
05:31:00,410 --> 05:31:02,190
Alright, let's check if we got enough.

4731
05:31:04,390 --> 05:31:05,650
Yeah, how do you lose?

4732
05:31:05,710 --> 05:31:06,230
30.

4733
05:31:06,850 --> 05:31:10,350
One is like triple the size of a regular flea.

4734
05:31:17,670 --> 05:31:21,890
Like at this point, I feel like we're just abducting children for your caravan.

4735
05:31:23,190 --> 05:31:25,010
How do we even know they're your kids?

4736
05:31:33,490 --> 05:31:33,830
Okay.

4737
05:31:35,250 --> 05:31:36,850
Home is the horned cornet.

4738
05:31:37,130 --> 05:31:41,290
Wonder how large our caravan has grown so bold and bolstrous.

4739
05:31:41,670 --> 05:32:41,990
This gilded chamber can barely conduct can need us all the many fleas are itching to journey once more to find a space to stretch their wings but from here as their leader I'm hesitant to order us so swiftly away these heights hold too much danger to set forth who has safe gold held clear in mind what of you miss hornet your task carries you throughout this kingdom have we encountered a place a place appropriate I have seen a place for the master a cave beyond the citadel at the edge of the some ancient suit your needs for safety that trek will be long but once reached you'll find a sandy shore free of predators beside a wide clear lake it is as peaceful a place as seen throughout these fraught lands that's it it must be our destination has been said our journey can continue true friend the fleas you are miss hornet that place shall welcome us no doubt will you be joining the caravan on this journey?

4740
05:32:42,650 --> 05:32:42,850
Yes.

4741
05:32:43,930 --> 05:32:45,850
I want to be in the dog car.

4742
05:32:47,090 --> 05:32:47,430
Marvelous!

4743
05:32:47,730 --> 05:32:52,170
Wefully shall be overjoyed to have your company on the road.

4744
05:32:52,770 --> 05:32:54,690
Now our new home is calling.

4745
05:32:55,090 --> 05:32:57,010
We must travel!

4746
05:32:59,690 --> 05:33:01,810
What a wonderful place.

4747
05:33:02,310 --> 05:33:05,170
Perch of petrified ducks.

4748
05:33:05,510 --> 05:33:07,970
Oh my god, there's so many now.

4749
05:33:08,350 --> 05:33:09,850
There's so many.

4750
05:33:11,410 --> 05:33:13,610
I think we need two cars.

4751
05:33:14,690 --> 05:33:14,870
Oh!

4752
05:33:16,790 --> 05:33:20,590
My entire cloak is just flea hair now.

4753
05:33:23,650 --> 05:33:27,290
Oh, the beautiful spot you've gifted us, Miss Hornet.

4754
05:33:28,030 --> 05:33:30,890
Safe apart from a dark and deaf with the lands beside.

4755
05:33:31,350 --> 05:33:33,570
A place for fleas to grow strong and smart.

4756
05:33:34,310 --> 05:33:35,930
Here we shall see our travels end.

4757
05:33:36,250 --> 05:33:39,150
For in Farloom, there can be no finer place to settle.

4758
05:33:39,930 --> 05:33:42,190
I am glad the location suits, Flea Master.

4759
05:33:43,070 --> 05:33:45,530
calming thing to know that many fleas may survive.

4760
05:33:46,230 --> 05:33:49,050
Most bugs of fire looms seem destined for far bleaker fates.

4761
05:33:49,870 --> 05:33:55,050
Indeed, a hopeful future awaits, and only because of yourself and your efforts.

4762
05:33:55,430 --> 05:33:59,910
To commemorate our arrival, it would be my pleasure to perform a small service for you.

4763
05:34:00,450 --> 05:34:02,070
I have been learning to sue.

4764
05:34:02,670 --> 05:34:05,070
So, and the little fleas have been gathering materials for me.

4765
05:34:05,410 --> 05:34:09,430
I thought I'd add an extra pocket for your tool pouch to make your travel a little easier.

4766
05:34:10,590 --> 05:34:14,970
A trifling flavor, So, I hope it meets your satisfaction.

4767
05:34:17,170 --> 05:34:18,290
Tool upgrade.

4768
05:34:19,070 --> 05:34:19,630
Leetopia.

4769
05:34:20,230 --> 05:34:20,810
Oh my god.

4770
05:34:21,130 --> 05:34:22,790
I have founded a new land.

4771
05:34:23,190 --> 05:34:23,910
And I shall cut.

4772
05:34:23,990 --> 05:34:24,570
Oh my god.

4773
05:34:24,650 --> 05:34:26,850
It's so far away from any fucking cars.

4774
05:34:27,530 --> 05:34:27,830
Oh my.

4775
05:34:27,830 --> 05:34:28,350
Why?

4776
05:34:28,930 --> 05:34:29,490
Why?

4777
05:34:29,610 --> 05:34:32,310
Why would you settle in petrified docks?

4778
05:34:33,050 --> 05:34:34,430
It's so far.

4779
05:34:34,670 --> 05:34:36,090
I'm angry now.

4780
05:34:36,790 --> 05:34:37,810
I'm mad.

4781
05:34:40,230 --> 05:34:42,290
This is a terrible place.

4782
05:34:42,650 --> 05:34:43,050
This is...

4783
05:34:45,110 --> 05:34:48,330
This place is actually terrible.

4784
05:34:48,990 --> 05:34:53,790
Oh my god.

4785
05:34:54,270 --> 05:34:56,050
Oh my god.

4786
05:34:56,170 --> 05:34:58,470
Where the fuck is this area?

4787
05:35:03,190 --> 05:35:04,830
Alright, I just want to be sure.

4788
05:35:05,350 --> 05:35:05,850
One, two.

4789
05:35:06,190 --> 05:35:06,930
Oh shit.

4790
05:35:07,230 --> 05:35:07,990
No fuck.

4791
05:35:09,730 --> 05:35:10,770
Oh fuck.

4792
05:35:18,440 --> 05:35:19,840
All right, we'll worry about that.

4793
05:35:19,980 --> 05:35:21,940
We'll let future Doki handle that.

4794
05:35:22,280 --> 05:35:24,000
I gotta figure out how to get home.

4795
05:35:24,640 --> 05:35:25,100
Oh!

4796
05:35:29,740 --> 05:35:32,780
Future Doki needs to figure out where home is.

4797
05:35:37,260 --> 05:35:38,700
Is it easier to go from up?

4798
05:35:38,840 --> 05:35:40,060
Oh, we'll try up first.

4799
05:35:40,460 --> 05:35:40,900
Fuck it.

4800
05:35:43,000 --> 05:35:45,040
If I die, oh, I was gonna sit.

4801
05:35:50,290 --> 05:35:50,890
All right.

4802
05:35:52,770 --> 05:35:55,050
Guys, what quest can we do next?

4803
05:35:56,130 --> 05:35:59,210
I'll do like one more quest and then we'll call it here.

4804
05:36:06,480 --> 05:36:06,980
The slab?

4805
05:36:08,320 --> 05:36:09,740
What's the slab quest?

4806
05:36:16,470 --> 05:36:17,050
That's fine.

4807
05:36:19,230 --> 05:36:20,490
It's no longer fine.

4808
05:36:27,980 --> 05:36:28,720
Yeah, I'm gonna heal.

4809
05:36:35,710 --> 05:36:38,210
Meet Shak- I'm not meeting Shak- I'm not going up.

4812
05:37:18,540 --> 05:37:20,820
Is it actually really easy?

4813
05:37:21,720 --> 05:37:22,140
Is it...

4814
05:37:26,420 --> 05:37:28,520
Apparently the merchant is easier.

4815
05:37:32,280 --> 05:37:33,360
What the fuck?

4816
05:37:34,500 --> 05:37:35,440
Who's crying?

4817
05:37:47,290 --> 05:37:48,030
All right.

4818
05:37:49,530 --> 05:37:50,130
All right.

4819
05:37:50,330 --> 05:37:51,910
We'll fight a boss.

4820
05:37:52,550 --> 05:37:54,010
Okay, we'll fight a boss.

4821
05:37:54,150 --> 05:37:55,410
I don't mind fighting a boss.

4822
05:37:55,750 --> 05:37:57,310
I won't end it with a boss fight anyway.

4823
05:37:58,170 --> 05:37:59,330
Can't be that bad.

4824
05:37:59,850 --> 05:38:01,550
My famous final words.

4825
05:38:02,270 --> 05:38:03,110
It can't be.

4826
05:38:04,250 --> 05:38:04,570
Oh.

4827
05:38:05,650 --> 05:38:06,290
Oh.

4828
05:38:08,710 --> 05:38:09,030
Oh.

4829
05:38:09,030 --> 05:38:09,170
Oh.

4830
05:38:10,070 --> 05:38:10,250
Oh.

4831
05:38:16,710 --> 05:38:17,350
Oh.

4832
05:38:18,430 --> 05:38:19,690
It's at the bench.

4833
05:38:22,630 --> 05:38:23,270
Here?

4834
05:38:23,650 --> 05:38:25,450
How do I get up there, though?

4835
05:38:26,850 --> 05:38:27,790
It won't let me.

4836
05:38:30,150 --> 05:38:30,870
Oh, never mind.

4837
05:38:30,990 --> 05:38:31,530
I got it.

4838
05:38:31,890 --> 05:38:32,470
Wake up.

4839
05:38:33,130 --> 05:38:33,770
Oh.

4840
05:38:34,870 --> 05:38:36,850
Okay, this one was an easy flea to get.

4841
05:38:38,110 --> 05:38:38,730
Thank God.

4842
05:38:41,070 --> 05:38:42,270
Is that the wailing mother?

4843
05:38:44,110 --> 05:38:46,450
What even is my quest for this?

4844
05:38:46,990 --> 05:38:48,210
I did not read it fully.

4845
05:38:50,970 --> 05:38:51,870
Oh, it is.

4846
05:38:53,830 --> 05:38:54,350
Ooh.

4847
05:38:58,750 --> 05:39:00,550
All right, here it is.

4848
05:39:07,330 --> 05:39:08,490
How do I find?

4849
05:39:08,510 --> 05:39:08,850
him.

4850
05:39:11,470 --> 05:39:12,170
8th of the 12th.

4851
05:39:12,410 --> 05:39:13,710
Guilty of the sinner in Revan's.

4852
05:39:13,950 --> 05:39:14,830
Penance by chaining.

4853
05:39:15,050 --> 05:39:15,850
Absolute granted.

4854
05:39:16,270 --> 05:39:17,630
Pentium 2nd of the 4th.

4855
05:39:17,830 --> 05:39:18,130
Guilty of...

4856
05:39:18,130 --> 05:39:19,430
Oh, they're just like prison thing.

4857
05:39:20,050 --> 05:39:21,310
Okay, this has to be a lore.

4858
05:39:22,090 --> 05:39:23,130
Lore room.

4859
05:39:26,850 --> 05:39:27,370

Where did I snap her?

4866
05:40:34,910 --> 05:40:35,490
His neck.

4867
05:40:35,690 --> 05:40:36,250

4868
05:40:39,650 --> 05:40:41,090
Oh, I think it was here.

4869
05:40:44,940 --> 05:40:45,960

4870
05:40:46,240 --> 05:40:46,500
No.

4871
05:40:47,880 --> 05:40:48,480
Oh, up?

Oh, my God.

4873
05:40:49,720 --> 05:40:51,040
I just missed the trap.

4874
05:40:55,030 --> 05:40:56,870
Second bench from the top.

4875
05:40:56,950 --> 05:40:57,410
Oh, okay.

4876
05:41:00,750 --> 05:41:01,310
Really?

4877
05:41:01,350 --> 05:41:03,030
I can't just go up from there.

4878
05:41:05,770 --> 05:41:07,370
Wait, then what the fuck did I unlock?

4879
05:41:08,650 --> 05:41:09,590
Oh, there it is.

4880
05:41:15,760 --> 05:41:17,160
What did I unlock?

4881
05:41:25,930 --> 05:41:27,890
Alright, that's good that there's a bench here.

4882
05:41:28,010 --> 05:41:28,730
Okay, she's here.

05:41:30,350 --> 05:41:31,230
She's not here?

4884
05:41:33,090 --> 05:41:33,430

05:43:34,260 --> 05:43:34,620
Alright.

4915
05:44:32,830 --> 05:44:34,050
Maybe this.

4916
05:44:34,230 --> 05:44:34,990
Maybe this.

4917
05:44:35,930 --> 05:44:37,190
I don't have enough.

4918
05:44:37,870 --> 05:44:39,290
Her combos are so annoying.

4919
05:44:40,670 --> 05:44:42,110
Let's grab this then.

4920
05:44:43,610 --> 05:44:44,390
Craft a little.

4921
05:44:47,710 --> 05:44:48,410
Maybe.

4922
05:44:49,050 --> 05:44:49,630
Uh.

4923
05:44:51,770 --> 05:44:52,750

05:45:04,270 --> 05:45:05,410
Okay.

4927
05:45:06,710 --> 05:45:08,510
What if I just...

4928
05:45:08,510 --> 05:45:08,710
Oops.

4929
05:45:10,750 --> 05:45:11,410
Okay, wait.

4930
05:45:12,110 --> 05:45:13,430
Yeah, I think this would be good.

4931
05:45:14,370 --> 05:45:14,650
Maybe.

4932
05:45:18,950 --> 05:45:20,950
Okay, at least there's friendly fire too.

4933
05:45:21,050 --> 05:45:21,510
That's good.

4934
05:45:25,030 --> 05:45:25,990
There you go.

4935
05:45:26,550 --> 05:45:27,590
There's friendly fire.

4936
05:45:32,330 --> 05:45:34,090
That doesn't do shit!

4937
05:45:34,630 --> 05:45:35,710
I'm so sad.

4938
05:45:36,910 --> 05:45:47,850
I'm so sad I thought it's okay okay that's fine

4939
05:45:51,330 --> 05:45:56,290

4941
05:46:19,750 --> 05:46:24,210
Oh my god!

4942
05:46:32,180 --> 05:46:32,740
God damn it!

4943
05:46:37,640 --> 05:46:39,140
There we go.

4944
05:46:40,120 --> 05:46:40,120
Jesus!

4945
05:46:40,440 --> 05:46:42,200
I just had to spout.

4946
05:46:42,340 --> 05:46:44,580
Oh my god, those poison bombs were so good.

4947
05:46:45,700 --> 05:46:47,700
The poison bombs were actually so clutch.

4948
05:46:50,220 --> 05:46:50,540
Nice.

4949
05:46:50,780 --> 05:46:52,060
Brood Mother's Eye.

4950
05:46:52,380 --> 05:46:52,660
Nice.

4951
05:46:53,140 --> 05:46:53,700
That's right.

4952
05:46:54,440 --> 05:46:56,820
Finally, we've rid the world of flies.

4953
05:46:57,100 --> 05:47:28,880
We did it the reptilian population might go extinct but we did it it's not about them it's not about them it's about me finally we did it boys they are now forever extinct it was for a good cause yeah the reason why like we could technically exterminate all mosquitoes but we shouldn't because It'll destroy the entire ecosystem.

4954
05:47:31,320 --> 05:47:32,560
But we don't care about that.

4955
05:47:34,620 --> 05:47:35,780
Who cares about that?

4956
05:47:35,980 --> 05:47:37,220
All the bugs are gone.

4957
05:47:37,920 --> 05:47:39,120
The flies are gone.

4958
05:47:40,360 --> 05:47:42,680
A necessary evil must be eliminated.

4959
05:47:44,760 --> 05:47:45,240
Wait, what?

4960
05:47:45,380 --> 05:47:46,040
Oh, it's here.

4961
05:47:50,580 --> 05:47:51,600
Did I go too far?

4962
05:47:51,700 --> 05:47:52,540
I went too far.

4963
05:47:52,660 --> 05:47:53,320

4964
05:47:55,480 --> 05:47:57,440
Wait, what is this area?

4965
05:47:57,680 --> 05:47:58,560
Where am I?

4966
05:48:02,120 --> 05:48:04,040
Guys, I don't know where I am.

4967
05:48:04,900 --> 05:48:06,340
I went too far.

4968
05:48:15,030 --> 05:48:17,530
Oh my god, I did not mean to be here.

4969
05:48:18,030 --> 05:48:18,890
Okay, nice.

4970
05:48:20,390 --> 05:48:21,350
Weaver effigy.

4971
05:48:21,650 --> 05:48:22,650
The fuck is that?

4972
05:48:25,190 --> 05:48:26,830

4973
05:48:26,830 --> 05:48:28,210
Oh, it's something to give.

4974
05:48:29,370 --> 05:48:30,450
I dug too deep.

4975
05:48:30,750 --> 05:48:31,950

05:48:33,330 --> 05:48:42,030

05:49:20,530 --> 05:49:21,410
I'm so confused.

4980
05:49:21,690 --> 05:49:22,470
I'm so lost.

4981
05:49:25,110 --> 05:49:26,150
And now we're up here.

4982
05:49:28,450 --> 05:49:28,970
Hello?

4983
05:49:30,150 --> 05:49:30,850
Oh, shit.

4984
05:49:31,030 --> 05:49:32,230
I'm in a thieves' room.

4985
05:49:33,010 --> 05:49:33,650
Oh, my money.

4986
05:49:35,830 --> 05:49:36,870
Ha, jokes on him.

4987
05:49:36,950 --> 05:49:38,350
I didn't have a lot of money.

4988
05:49:42,180 --> 05:49:43,620
I spent it all.

4989
05:49:44,900 --> 05:49:46,400
Okay, now I'm here.

4990
05:49:47,060 --> 05:49:48,480
Oh, oh, shortcut.

4991
05:49:50,120 --> 05:49:50,520
Oh!

4992
05:49:51,360 --> 05:49:52,580
That makes sense.

4993
05:49:55,440 --> 05:49:56,100
Yeah, that's right.

4994
05:49:56,180 --> 05:49:57,020
Jokes on them.

4995
05:49:57,120 --> 05:49:58,500
I was already broke.

4996
05:49:59,200 --> 05:50:00,280
Okay, now I'm here.

4997
05:50:02,320 --> 05:50:05,760
I thought this area would lead me to the bench, but I guess not.

4998
05:50:07,040 --> 05:50:07,640
That's fine.

4999
05:50:07,740 --> 05:50:08,760
I just want to kill him anyway.

5000
05:50:09,600 --> 05:50:10,500
I'll deal with him from here.

5001
05:50:11,740 --> 05:50:12,820
Wait, where did I have to go?

5002
05:50:14,800 --> 05:50:17,440
Is there anything else I have to do here?

5003
05:50:19,300 --> 05:50:20,000
What's in?

5004
05:50:26,590 --> 05:50:27,330
Alright.

5005
05:50:29,410 --> 05:50:30,870
Oh my god, I forgot the freaks!

5006
05:50:33,690 --> 05:50:36,150
I forgot about these people.

5007
05:50:37,030 --> 05:50:39,330
Oh my god, the freaky...

5008
05:50:39,330 --> 05:50:43,190
Freaky prisoner at ex-guard roleplay.

5009
05:50:44,350 --> 05:50:46,130
It's the BBB enjoyers.

5010
05:50:48,890 --> 05:50:50,230
There's a hidden boss.

5011
05:50:50,350 --> 05:50:51,190
How hard is he?

5012
05:50:51,910 --> 05:50:56,490
Alright, I'll do one more boss, because that boss was not as hard as I thought.

5013
05:50:59,030 --> 05:51:00,230
I'll do one more.

5014
05:51:07,480 --> 05:51:08,620
Decently hard.

5015
05:51:08,860 --> 05:51:09,120
Okay.

5016
05:51:10,240 --> 05:51:12,300
What's... Okay, I'll see it.

5017
05:51:12,360 --> 05:51:13,320
I'll look at it.

5018
05:51:15,680 --> 05:51:18,000
I'll look at it and see how I feel.

5019
05:51:19,100 --> 05:51:19,960
Is it this one?

5020
05:51:20,080 --> 05:51:20,600
Is it here?

5021
05:51:24,010 --> 05:51:26,450
Okay, I did not enjoy the widow fight.

5022
05:51:27,750 --> 05:51:30,790
I absolutely did not enjoy the widow fight.

5023
05:51:34,790 --> 05:51:35,190
Below.

5024
05:51:37,870 --> 05:51:38,850
The lore signs.

5025
05:51:38,930 --> 05:51:41,050
I don't even remember where the lore signs was.

5026
05:51:42,650 --> 05:51:43,790
Is it here?

5027
05:51:55,090 --> 05:51:55,610
Here?

5028
05:51:58,290 --> 05:51:59,950
Oh, right below it.

5029
05:52:00,050 --> 05:52:00,330
Here.

5030
05:52:03,510 --> 05:52:03,950
Okay.

5031
05:52:04,330 --> 05:52:04,610
Alright.

5032
05:52:05,310 --> 05:52:06,510
I'll see how I feel.

5033
05:52:07,290 --> 05:52:13,550
I forgot, like, I can't do anything on the set.

5034
05:52:15,650 --> 05:52:18,470
Alright, we'll see how this boss feels.

5035
05:52:22,970 --> 05:52:25,750
Actually, uh...

5036
05:52:25,750 --> 05:52:26,670
We're gonna do that.

5037
05:52:26,770 --> 05:52:29,410

5038
05:52:30,170 --> 05:52:30,990
Alright, guys.

5039
05:52:31,250 --> 05:52:33,210
Is the boss...

5040
05:52:33,210 --> 05:52:36,870
A flying boss or a...

5041
05:52:36,870 --> 05:52:37,770
Ground boss?

5042
05:52:44,220 --> 05:52:46,020
Because, like, not flying.

5043
05:52:46,080 --> 05:52:46,660
Okay, I'll grab chain.

5044
05:52:46,680 --> 05:52:48,600

5045
05:52:55,080 --> 05:52:56,700
I'll grab my saws.

5046
05:52:58,680 --> 05:52:59,620
The wheel.

5047
05:53:03,990 --> 05:53:05,010
The ground type.

5048
05:53:05,150 --> 05:53:05,430
Okay.

5049
05:53:06,070 --> 05:53:07,110

5051
05:53:10,030 --> 05:53:12,650
Okay, you guys know I hated the widow boss, so...

5052
05:53:12,650 --> 05:53:14,590
Like, the widow was actually my kryptonite.

5053
05:53:15,750 --> 05:53:16,730

5054
05:53:17,130 --> 05:53:18,050

06:00:34,420 --> 06:00:35,660
Holy fuck.

5138
06:00:35,980 --> 06:00:38,160
Okay, her attacks are like...

5139
06:00:38,160 --> 06:00:42,400
Her pattern's easy, but it's also like...

5140
06:00:42,400 --> 06:00:43,900
Like, not easy, but like...

5141
06:00:43,900 --> 06:00:46,960
I can sense her pattern, but she's so fast.

5142
06:00:47,320 --> 06:00:48,640
She's just so fast.

5143
06:01:02,230 --> 06:01:02,590
Okay.

5144
06:01:06,170 --> 06:01:08,430
That's like my only...

5145
06:01:08,430 --> 06:01:09,950
The hardest part about her.

5146
06:01:10,950 --> 06:01:11,570
Okay.

5147
06:01:13,570 --> 06:01:14,090
Okay.

5148
06:01:15,350 --> 06:01:16,090
There we go.

5149
06:01:22,110 --> 06:01:23,190
Oh my god, I feel that.

5150
06:01:27,020 --> 06:01:27,540
There we go.

5151
06:01:29,040 --> 06:01:30,160
God damn it, I didn't think.

5152
06:01:35,010 --> 06:01:36,210
Oh my god.

5153
06:01:36,470 --> 06:01:37,110
I thought I could.

5154
06:01:40,130 --> 06:01:41,450
Are you serious?

5155
06:01:42,330 --> 06:01:43,570
Oh, that's so unlucky for me.

5156
06:01:44,470 --> 06:01:45,790
That's actually so...

5157
06:01:49,270 --> 06:01:50,670
Oh my god, good roll

5158
06:01:58,260 --> 06:02:11,000
Oh my god, that was so close I'm getting, I'm figuring her out though Okay, I'm hard focusing I'm hard focusing Oh my god, I think she should have been prison forever Why did I free her?

5159
06:02:11,460 --> 06:02:15,680
I met up, I fucked up by freeing her Now I know why

5160
06:02:25,080 --> 06:02:26,580
Are you serious?

5161
06:02:36,460 --> 06:02:37,340
Jesus.

5162
06:02:40,980 --> 06:02:41,860
Okay.

5163
06:02:46,940 --> 06:02:47,820
Nice.

5164
06:02:48,220 --> 06:02:48,600
For me?

5165
06:02:52,200 --> 06:02:53,160
Are you serious?

5166
06:02:53,360 --> 06:02:54,940
Of course she uses a dash now.

5167
06:02:57,120 --> 06:02:58,100
All right.

5168
06:03:00,040 --> 06:03:02,200
Nice, I canceled in time.

5169
06:03:03,460 --> 06:03:03,460
Oh,

5170
06:03:08,380 --> 06:03:09,480
I didn't see the other...

5171
06:03:14,210 --> 06:03:15,470
God damn it.

5172
06:03:21,710 --> 06:03:23,770
I thought I canceled in time!

5173
06:03:26,510 --> 06:03:27,010
Fuck!

5174
06:03:29,650 --> 06:03:29,930
Okay.

5175
06:03:31,130 --> 06:03:32,670
That was my bad.

5176
06:03:33,690 --> 06:03:34,690
No.

5177
06:03:41,550 --> 06:03:42,550
Okay.

5178
06:03:43,110 --> 06:03:44,110
Are you serious?

5179
06:03:44,110 --> 06:03:48,110
Oh my god, he knocked me up in the air.

5180
06:03:50,490 --> 06:03:52,610
Oh, he knocked me up.

5181
06:03:53,470 --> 06:03:54,090
That sucked.

5182
06:03:55,250 --> 06:03:58,750
I just got the heal and then he knocked me into his hitbox.

5183
06:04:00,010 --> 06:04:01,230
No, I just got it.

5184
06:04:01,610 --> 06:04:02,910
I just got the heal.

5185
06:04:03,970 --> 06:04:05,290
I didn't have it yet.

5186
06:04:12,050 --> 06:04:12,650
Okay.

5187
06:04:14,570 --> 06:04:14,910
Okay.

5188
06:04:15,250 --> 06:04:15,850
Okay.

5189
06:04:15,870 --> 06:04:17,470
Oh my god, fucking course.

5190
06:04:21,250 --> 06:04:21,650
Okay.

5191
06:04:22,990 --> 06:04:23,390

5192
06:04:27,010 --> 06:04:27,810

06:04:30,170 --> 06:04:30,570
Okay.

5194
06:04:32,270 --> 06:04:33,330
I'm just gonna heal here.

5195
06:04:35,050 --> 06:04:36,150
Oh my god, did he get it?

5196
06:04:36,210 --> 06:04:36,690
I can't tell.

5197
06:04:37,050 --> 06:04:37,490
I don't know.

5198
06:04:37,890 --> 06:04:39,030
I don't know if he got to heal.

5199
06:04:41,530 --> 06:04:42,910
Are you serious?

5200
06:04:49,470 --> 06:04:49,870

5232
06:08:38,230 --> 06:08:38,330

Ah!

5255

Oh my god, I just want your skill.

5256
06:11:46,970 --> 06:11:49,130
Do you have to put me in a fucking maze?

5257
06:11:51,610 --> 06:11:53,170
Yeah, let's try then.

5258
06:11:53,590 --> 06:11:57,170
When someone was like, used a harpoon, it like, licked in my head.

5259
06:12:00,050 --> 06:12:03,590
My reward for beating this boss is more parkour!

5260
06:12:04,070 --> 06:12:04,350
Yay!

5261
06:12:06,090 --> 06:12:07,810
Yeah, I heard like...

5262
06:12:07,810 --> 06:12:08,250
Oh, hey.

5263
06:12:09,830 --> 06:12:10,130
Oh?

5264
06:12:13,710 --> 06:12:14,870
Oh, it's Laura.

5265
06:12:15,130 --> 06:12:16,950
The silk evolved the spider.

5266
06:12:17,290 --> 06:12:18,870
Oh, it evolved the tiny little spider.

5267
06:12:18,950 --> 06:12:20,210
Wait, that's who I was?

5268
06:12:29,750 --> 06:12:31,090
Reward, Lord.

5269
06:12:32,090 --> 06:12:33,190
She called us daughters.

5270
06:12:33,450 --> 06:12:34,350
Call us to fight.

5271
06:12:34,750 --> 06:12:35,750
She lied.

5272
06:12:37,970 --> 06:12:38,210
Oh!

5273
06:12:39,030 --> 06:12:40,990
So the weavers came from silk.

5274
06:12:41,270 --> 06:12:44,570
They got evolved, just like how my dad evolved the other citizens.

5275
06:12:46,290 --> 06:12:46,810
Waves.

5276
06:12:47,210 --> 06:12:47,590
Weavers.

5277
06:12:47,590 --> 06:12:49,810
Wraith runes of blazing silk upon enemies.

5278
06:12:50,250 --> 06:12:51,750
Silk skills can be...

5279
06:12:51,750 --> 06:12:52,430
Okay, cool.

5280
06:12:53,950 --> 06:12:54,250
Cool.

5281
06:13:07,150 --> 06:13:09,570
It's like the monkeys when they hit the monolith.

5282
06:13:10,630 --> 06:13:11,630
Assume they gave it up.

5283
06:13:14,290 --> 06:13:15,830
What the fuck does this do?

5284
06:13:19,210 --> 06:13:21,190
Is this a circle attack?

5285
06:13:23,370 --> 06:13:25,990
Oh, the explosion thing?

5286
06:13:31,460 --> 06:13:32,080
Oh.

5287
06:13:33,040 --> 06:13:34,580
Yeah, that's RNG as hell.

5288
06:13:34,740 --> 06:13:35,460
Fuck that shit.

5289
06:13:36,920 --> 06:13:37,640
I'm leaving.

5290
06:13:40,240 --> 06:13:41,660
Yeah, that shit never hit me.

5291
06:13:41,880 --> 06:13:43,000
Other than that one time.

5292
06:13:46,920 --> 06:13:47,540
Yep.

5293
06:13:48,000 --> 06:13:48,440
Yep.

5294
06:13:49,380 --> 06:13:52,020
Look at how it didn't even hit him.

5295
06:13:52,760 --> 06:13:55,140
Yeah, that room sucks.

5296
06:13:58,560 --> 06:14:01,200
It hit everything but him.

5297
06:14:03,920 --> 06:14:04,960
Oh my god, let's see.

5298
06:14:07,940 --> 06:14:09,280
Haha, I killed your lover.

5299
06:14:10,800 --> 06:14:14,700
Now I hope you live a long life knowing that I killed the love of your life.

5300
06:14:15,320 --> 06:14:16,220
Oh wait, he also died.

5301
06:14:16,300 --> 06:14:16,720
Never mind.

5302
06:14:16,820 --> 06:14:17,420
It got him too.

5303
06:14:20,240 --> 06:14:20,940
Let's see.

5304
06:14:22,180 --> 06:14:22,580
Oh, my God.

5305
06:14:22,660 --> 06:14:23,540
We'll call it here.

5306
06:14:26,060 --> 06:14:26,940
Oh, wow.

5307
06:14:27,440 --> 06:14:28,220
That was...

5308
06:14:28,740 --> 06:14:30,480
I don't know if I would...

5309
06:14:30,480 --> 06:14:32,000
I mean, I guess it was fun.

5310
06:14:33,360 --> 06:14:41,240
I think when I learned how to use the harpoon, the fact that I didn't even use tools for it, when I beat her, I think when I learned...

5311
06:14:41,240 --> 06:14:43,940
I don't know if she was bugged or like...

5312
06:14:43,940 --> 06:14:47,880
Because on the run that I beat her, she stood still.

5313
06:14:48,240 --> 06:14:49,200
But I think it's because, like...

5314
06:14:49,220 --> 06:14:56,360
Like, um, I guess it was like, uh, uh, I don't know.

5315
06:14:56,500 --> 06:15:01,780
Was he supposed to stand still when that was going on?

5316
06:15:02,380 --> 06:15:04,000
No, she just does that.

5317
06:15:04,320 --> 06:15:05,680
Oh, it was just good RNG.

5318
06:15:06,200 --> 06:15:07,540

Yeah.

5321
06:15:11,520 --> 06:15:18,660

5322
06:15:20,320 --> 06:15:33,400
But, um, but after when whoever was like used a harpoon on, they like everything just clicked because her patterns were easy Her patterns were really easy to figure out Um, but like it was just she was so fucking fast.

5323
06:15:33,520 --> 06:15:34,040
That was it.

5324
06:15:34,300 --> 06:15:35,300
She was just so fast.

5325
06:15:35,460 --> 06:15:40,140
