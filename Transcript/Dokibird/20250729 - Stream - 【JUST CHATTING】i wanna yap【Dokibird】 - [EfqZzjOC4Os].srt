1
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,270
Hello!

2
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,150
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

3
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,150
Hello, everybody!

4
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,210
Hello!

5
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:46,490
Hello!

6
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:48,850
Oh my gosh, sorry.

7
00:03:49,210 --> 00:04:00,890
I know, like, I baited you guys, uh, for those who were waiting for, like, I don't know, maybe 15 plus hours for Elden Ring because I did make my waiting room super early because I- I legit thought I was gonna play Elden Ring today.

8
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,190
I- I was like, oh, if anything, at least I know I'm playing Elden Ring tomorrow.

9
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,670
But, like, whoops.

10
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,270
It's just a chatting stream now.

11
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:10,830
Um, okay.

12
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:20,990
So now some of you guys are wondering, okay, before I talk about other stuff, some of you guys are wondering, oh, Adoki, why are you not showing the rest of your- the rest of your head?

13
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:28,770
Well, I was gonna show it on Elden Ring, but I was like, you know, since I'm just chatting, then I have a better showcase for this.

14
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,630
But, we finally got the update, guys.

15
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:32,690
Yes.

16
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,330
As in nothing.

17
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:34,910
No, I'm sorry.

18
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:38,590
Oh, yes.

19
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,010
We finally- Whoa!

20
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,710
Wait, this changed.

21
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:43,510
Whoa!

22
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,260
Yes.

23
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,680
We finally got the update.

24
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,660
The long hair- Long hair Doki!

25
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:56,600
Yeah!

26
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,460
Yes.

27
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,320
Watch this.

28
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,620
Oh, short hair.

29
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,400
Long hair.

30
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,080
Short hair.

31
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:03,880
Long hair.

32
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,820
Short hair.

33
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,880
I just magically grew longer hair.

34
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,580
Like- Or maybe they're extensions.

35
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,180
I don't know.

36
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:09,580
Oh, yeah.

37
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,800
I'm just clipping all my extensions.

38
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,320
No extensions.

39
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,240
Extensions.

40
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,320
No extensions.

41
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,300
Extensions!

42
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,720
But, yes.

43
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,040
We finally- Um...

44
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,840
We finally got the update today.

45
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,100
Avalian, thank you for the- Five gifted chefs.

46
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:29,400
Thank you.

47
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:29,960
Thank you.

48
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,360
Doki.

49
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,020
Doki.

50
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:32,540
Doki.

51
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,940
Let down your golden hair.

52
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,400
If only it were- It's just like- I'm just putting on- Oh, you're right.

53
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,720
I should- Wait, what- Where is it?

54
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,440
You're right.

55
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,220
I should try it.

56
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,020
Where is it?

57
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:48,620
Is it this one?

58
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:48,900
No.

59
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,620
Wait, where is- It's this one.

60
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,660
What does it look like?

61
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,020
That's what it looks like with the long neck, too.

62
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,080
Uh, Tom.

63
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,720
Thank you for the five gifted chefs.

64
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,140
Thank you.

65
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:02,940
Thank you.

66
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:04,820
Um...

67
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,600
Is it perfection?

68
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,240
I know.

69
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,840
It's absolutely perfect.

70
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,960
As it meant to be.

71
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,200
Um...

72
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:12,340
Um...

73
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,020
I love my maidenless ex-Fujo Kamiyoshi.

74
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:15,560
Thank you.

75
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,880
I'm glad everyone agrees with me that I am an ex-Fujo.

76
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:19,700
Oh, man.

77
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,520
Thank you for the super chat.

78
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:20,820
Thank you.

79
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,320
Thank you.

80
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:21,900
Zyko.

81
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,960
Thank you for the super chat.

82
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,320
Thank you.

83
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,160
Thank you.

84
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:25,900
Alright.

85
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,720
Let me, uh, put it back down.

86
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:33,520
I mean, it was a perfect time to- To show the- To showcase the long hair.

87
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:33,960
But yes!

88
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,000
Um, we finally got it.

89
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,460
Yippee!

90
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,300
Um...

91
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:38,760
But, okay.

92
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,200
What was I talking about earlier today?

93
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,440
Before- Oh, yes!

94
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,560
Uh...

95
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,780
Yes, I had to change- It was either cancel the stream or just do a chatting stream.

96
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:54,400
Because I have- Right now, I- Really have no energy to play a game at the moment.

97
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,620
Or, like, do a long stream.

98
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,580
I- I- I just had no- Like, I- I wouldn't say play a game.

99
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,660
I would say I just didn't have the energy to do a long stream today.

100
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,740
And I knew that if I was gonna play Eldering today, It was gonna be a very long stream.

101
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:13,080
Because I've been, like, working up non-stop behind the scenes the last, uh, two days.

102
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,440
And I have to work more today as well.

103
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,860
So, this week is, like, super chonky.

104
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,040
It's- It's- Um...

105
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:22,960
Um...

106
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,560
But, yes.

107
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,400
Um...

108
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,800
I'm warning you guys right now.

109
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,720
I'm gonna be a NASCAR for a week.

110
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,240
For those who are like, What the fuck do you mean?

111
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,660
Okay, so you know how NASCAR's, They have, like, all these ads and everything plastered all over the place?

112
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,380
Okay.

113
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,660
So, it was very unfortunate timing.

114
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:49,820
Because, um, It would have to look less like a NASCAR If, like, I didn't have to move a sponsor stream from next week To this week.

115
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,420
So, um...

116
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,000
So, basically, yeah.

117
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:54,820
It's this week.

118
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,120
Okay, it's literally, like, three...

119
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,120
Maybe four back-to-back.

120
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,220
These are just sponsors!

121
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,820
It's- It's- It's a little- It's a little unfortunate with how everything's scheduled.

122
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,800
But, like, it was- It was partially my fault.

123
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,860
Because I had to move stuff around.

124
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,360
Um...

125
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,740
Okay, I'll give you guys, uh...

126
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,620
Oh, yeah.

127
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,980
We're- Okay.

128
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,340
So, like, um...

129
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,580
So, alright.

130
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,880
Tuesday and Wednesday is our basically rest- Like, not- Not chilling time.

131
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,640
But, Thursday, we have two things.

132
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,820
I'll give you guys the schedule.

133
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,540
So, Thursday, there- We have a sponsored game in the morning.

134
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,800
And in the- In the evening, we have the, uh...

135
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,460
Vite Ramen, uh, collab.

136
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,360
Where we're doing the- The launch of our merch.

137
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,560
With Vite Ramen.

138
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,300
It's technically, it's sponsors.

139
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,800
It's a sponsor thing.

140
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,180
Well, uh, technically, it's sort of sponsored.

141
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,280
Because I'm shilling my merch.

142
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,460
Uh, uh, uh, with Vite Ramen.

143
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,600
Uh, for those who don't know what Vite Ramen is.

144
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,040
It's, like, um...

145
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,860
They basically make, like, cooking stuff.

146
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,520
So, like, uh, there's, like, cooking.

147
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,340
Uh, like, you know, I think you guys are- Some of the videos and teasers are already released.

148
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,560
So, there's one with the- Like, the Doki board with a cutting board and everything.

149
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:14,200
Um, so- So, Thursday, it's a double- A double whammy.

150
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:14,960
Friday!

151
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,580
There is a special sponsor stream.

152
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,580
Um, because they, like, message- I told you guys about the sponsor stream before.

153
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,320
Like, it's from- Uh, I can't reveal it yet.

154
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,420
Because they- They want to tweet it out first before they reveal it.

155
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,840
But it's for a game that I play a lot.

156
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,100
So, like, hint, hint.

157
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,480
Like- So, they reached out to me.

158
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,080
Last week, if I wanted to be in it.

159
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,640
And I was like, oh, fuck yeah, of course.

160
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,880
Um, yeah, of course I would love to be in it.

161
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,460
And, uh, so, that's Friday.

162
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,180
And then, after that, I'll do Elder Ring after that.

163
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,880
So, it doesn't seem like it's all sponsors.

164
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,120
And then, on Saturday, I'm sponsored to play the fake trigger tournament.

165
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,420
The anime girl battle royale game.

166
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:05,380
Um, so, on Saturday, I am also- I'm also sponsored to be in that tournament.

167
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:13,820
Um, coincidentally, they actually put, like, uh, all the people- Like, they're like, oh, we want to make sure- We just want to put Doki with people that she know.

168
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,020
And then, all the people that they sponsored for it were also people I know.

169
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,640
So, so, I'm on a team with Sure4, RPR, and Albert Lele.

170
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,260
So, that's- It's funny, because I was like, wait, we're all sponsored to be.

171
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,820
Like- So, it's, uh, so, that's a fake trigger tournament.

172
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:39,860
And, if we do well, uh, we have to be there for day two, which is on Sunday.

173
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:49,620
Uh, so, so, I'm just like, so, it could potentially be a four-day back-to-back-to-back-to-back sponsored week.

174
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:57,700
If we, like, make it- If we do well on Saturday and make it to the next round, we will have to show up on the second day.

175
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,500
Because, obviously, that's the finals.

176
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,920
So, so, so, oh, no, sounds terrible.

177
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,240
Money, money, money.

178
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:16,960
So, um, uh, so, that's, that's, that's NASCAR week for us.

179
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:22,200
That's gonna be, uh, that's gonna, it's gonna be NASCAR week.

180
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,520
So, it's start- NASCAR week starts on Thursday.

181
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,840
Um, we are, we do have, like, a little, like, break, you know, with the, in the pit.

182
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,060
Where we get to play Elden Ring a little bit on Friday.

183
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:40,160
After this, also, by the way, Friday and Saturday sponsors are gonna be on Twitch, too.

184
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,540
Because of Twitch drops.

185
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:47,220
Um, um, so, uh, Friday, we'll be on Twitch.

186
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,140
You know, the first stream, what, the special stream for those, uh, quote-unquote, don't know.

187
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,220
Oh, what could it be?

188
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,240
Uh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

189
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,940
Oh my gosh, what could the special stream on Friday be?

190
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,760
Um, with Twitch drops.

191
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,040
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

192
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,980
I can't say it.

193
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,980
They're like, no, no, no, no, don't say anything.

194
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,600
I was like, okay.

195
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,860
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

196
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:15,560
Uh, uh, but, um, it'll be on, uh, it'll be on Friday, Twitch drops.

197
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:20,060
And then Saturday, there's also Twitch drops for the tournament as well.

198
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,600
Uh, so, it's definitely Rocket League.

199
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,540
Yeah, totally.

200
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:24,960
A hundred.

201
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,060
I've never, I've actually never played Rocket League before.

202
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,600
Um, surprisingly.

203
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:36,080
Oh yeah, I forgot to show you guys what it looks like with, um, with the hoodie up, too.

204
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,200
Yay, oh, it's so cute.

205
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,640
I actually never, I actually never seen it with the hoodie up, too.

206
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,100
I, oh, wait, this actually is so cute with the hoodie up.

207
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:45,460
Whoa.

208
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,520
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

209
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,880
This is actually my first time.

210
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,840
See, I'm experiencing it with you guys, too.

211
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,780
Uh, ha, ha, ha.

212
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,820
I literally, they got the file.

213
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,600
They got the new skin suit, and I just plopped it on right before stream.

214
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,620
I didn't even check it out at all.

215
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,260
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

216
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,580
I just, I just plopped it on, and it's like, all right, it's time.

217
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,460
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

218
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,260
Uh, which one do you guys want?

219
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,260
Tomato or Dragoon Hoodie?

220
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,960
Which one do you guys like more?

221
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:15,840
Chat.

222
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,040
Tomato or Dragoon Hoodie more?

223
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,860
Which one?

224
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,120
You guys get to decide.

225
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,380
I'll let you guys fight for it.

226
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,000
Forbidden!

227
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,820
Thank, welcome to the tomato farm!

228
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,880
Welcome, welcome, tomato!

229
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,360
Okay, we'll do tomato.

230
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,980
All right, down or up?

231
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,420
Uh.

232
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:31,820
Uh.

233
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,380
Hmm.

234
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,120
I think.

235
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,040
Oh, it's cute.

236
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,340
Yeah.

237
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,060
Uh.

238
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,820
Ooh, maybe I'll do this too.

239
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,600
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

240
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,220
Um.

241
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,160
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

242
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,800
Okay, no lollipop.

243
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:54,580
Um.

244
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,960
Oh, what was I saying?

245
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:56,820
Uh.

246
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,700
P-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p.

247
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,660
Yeah, uh.

248
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,460
It-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's a little awkward.

249
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:11,740
Because I-we didn't-we didn't really-we didn't really, like, uh, spread the sponsors for this week.

250
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:18,280
Because, like I said, everything just happened to align on this week as well.

251
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,960
To be fair, my manager did sign the fake trigger sponsor first.

252
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,240
And then, uh, and then I was-and then, like, my rep-

253
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,680
Cut that out.

254
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,420
Cut that out.

255
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,200
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

256
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,280
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

257
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:34,580
Okay.

258
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,980
Oh, we didn't hear that.

259
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,060
We didn't- Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

260
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,800
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

261
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,280
The-the company.

262
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,780
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

263
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,620
Edit the vibe.

264
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,880
Edit the quick time.

265
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,160
I can't-I-I may.

266
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,620
Alright, edit-it's okay.

267
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,760
It's just a chatting stream.

268
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:53,720
I-we don't-we don't-we don't-we don't-we don't-I love-I love-FPS games.

269
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,080
Woo!

270
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:59,620
Including, for example, Apex Legends, Marvel Rivals, Overwatch.

271
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,020
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

272
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,840
Overwatch Overwatch.

273
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:09,480
Uh, um, uh, Fig Trigger's technically a third-person shooter and also Fortnite.

274
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:10,620
Yeah.

275
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,780
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

276
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,240
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

277
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,640
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

278
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,280
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

279
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:17,500
Um, yeah.

280
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,040
Um, anyway.

281
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:27,420
Anyway, like I said, yeah, everything just happened to, uh, line up together.

282
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,680
Uh, so, uh,

283
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,740
Halo, Val- No, no, Valorant will never be included.

284
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,480
I don't think-I honestly-I don't even think, like, Riot needs to sponsor anyone for League or Valorant because people literally do it for free.

285
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:53,460
Like, I- I don't think-I don't think they need to sponsor anybody for that.

286
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:58,960
Um, Uh, BK, BTK.

287
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,800
Thank you for the Super Chat.

288
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,080
Thank you.

289
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:00,500
Thank you.

290
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,420
Shake and Bake Doki.

291
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,160
Remember, if you're not first, you're last- No, you're not- You're last.

292
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,140
Congrats to the sponsors.

293
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,980
Thank you for the, uh, Super Chat.

294
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,320
Thank you.

295
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,020
Thank you.

296
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,000
laughs

297
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:21,920
Uh, what was I gonna say?

298
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,720
But yeah, I was working on the schedule.

299
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,580
That's why the schedule was super late.

300
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:35,160
Because we had to wait for confirmation on time slots for everything, basically.

301
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,560
So we had to confirm times.

302
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:48,700
It's so difficult sometimes to confirm times and everything on a schedule in advance.

303
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:58,860
Because a lot of times, a lot of these events and stuff... Especially if they're like... If it's not just... If it's just individual sponsors, I get to decide the time and date for things.

304
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:11,660
But if it's a group sponsor or a group event or stuff like that, usually the confirmation for things are done two to three days before the actual event.

305
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,840
Or maybe four days.

306
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:18,560
And I have to... Basically, we have to push to figure out the times and everything.

307
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:25,680
Because like, you know, like a lot of this are... Like, you know, you have to align the schedules with everyone too.

308
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:36,240
Like, the fake trigger tournament has like... I think like... 12... 11... Wait... 22 teams in there?

309
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,760
And it's 22 teams of four.

310
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,640
I think it's 22.

311
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,500
Let me double check.

312
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,980
It was a lot of teams.

313
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:42,560
I looked at it.

314
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,080
I was like...

315
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,080
Whoa.

316
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:49,880
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19...

317
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,600
Oh yeah, it's 22.

318
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,080
It's 22 teams of four.

319
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,900
And like, quick maths.

320
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,020
Somebody quick maths that for me real quick.

321
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,640
So like, you know, they have to align the schedule for like 96 people.

322
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,720
They asked me like, if I wanted to be group A and group B.

323
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,900
Like, they gave me a choice.

324
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,800
And then group A was at 12 p.m.

325
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,780
And obviously, I didn't pick that time.

326
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,340
I... Because like, we have a... Or 88, sorry.

327
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,180
We had a... We have a... A... Look, who said 96?

328
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,380
I literally read the first person.

329
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,360
Endless quietness.

330
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,740
I got one guide by this one...

331
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,320
How did you get 96?

332
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,960
Like, how did you get 90?

333
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:41,180
There was only one person that said 96, but he was the fastest one.

334
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,600
So obviously, I read his name first.

335
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,200
Anyway.

336
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,940
So, what was I gonna say?

337
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,020
Uh...

338
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,220
He's so confident.

339
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,380
He was so fast too.

340
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,500
Uh...

341
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,140
Eternally.

342
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,060
Thank you for the super chat.

343
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:04,760
Thank you, thank you.

344
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,460
Doki's my friend's Vincent's birthday.

345
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,060
Can you please say happy birthday to him?

346
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:08,840
Of course I can.

347
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,680
Happy birthday to you.

348
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,480
Happy birthday to you.

349
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,300
Happy birthday, dear Vincent.

350
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,360
Happy birthday to you.

351
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:16,820
Yeah!

352
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,460
Happy birthday.

353
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,520
But yeah.

354
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,720
So they're like, you want group A or group B?

355
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,620
And I saw 12pm versus 3pm.

356
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,500
And we all know what happens when I try to play FPS games.

357
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,460
Or like, even just any shooter.

358
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,960
Like, in the morning.

359
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,440
It does not go so well for me.

360
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,400
So...

361
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,380
So I was like, no, fuck that shit.

362
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,260
I'm fucking up with play.

363
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,080
I'm like...

364
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,060
I'm picking group.

365
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,240
I don't know why they asked me specifically.

366
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,340
Um...

367
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,000
I guess like...

368
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,460
Because like...

369
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,260
There's no captains on our team.

370
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,540
Like, we're literally all...

371
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,920
All four of us...

372
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,340
We're sponsored...

373
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:51,500
Uh...

374
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,140
We're sponsored to join the tournament.

375
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,240
So like...

376
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,180
There's no like actual captain-captain.

377
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,940
But like, apparently I have the most say for our team.

378
00:19:59,180 --> 00:19:59,980
Because they like...

379
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,500
Just specifically asked me if I wanted group A or group B.

380
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,100
And I was like, group B.

381
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,140
Because I don't want to wake up that early on Saturday.

382
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,180
I...

383
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:13,530
I was like, we're all...

384
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,290
I was...

385
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,090
Because like...

386
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:15,490
Um...

387
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:15,950
Because like...

388
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:18,770
The tournament is mixed between...

389
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,230
Um...

390
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,090
Um...

391
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:25,670
The tournament is mixed between like sign-ups and people who were sponsored.

392
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,330
Um...

393
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:27,850
I assume.

394
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:28,770
Um...

395
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,910
Because I saw that...

396
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:30,370
Uh...

397
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:34,930
The organizer made like a call-out for like teams to sign up and stuff.

398
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,870
So I assume that's the case.

399
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,190
Uh...

400
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,670
But yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

401
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,930
I did try a little bit.

402
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:45,890
I did try a little bit of the game yesterday.

403
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:46,830
Yesterday night.

404
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:47,950
And it's pretty fun.

405
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:49,490
Um...

406
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:49,890
Um...

407
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:50,610
It's basically...

408
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:53,050
Like I said, it's like battle royale.

409
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,150
Battle royale anime girls.

410
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,390
With like abilities and stuff.

411
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,550
So I had a good time checking it out.

412
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,770
Mery, thank you for the Akasupa.

413
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:03,350
Thank you.

414
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,070
Thank you.

415
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:06,030
Finally fulfilling my promise to you.

416
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,110
Paying for your...

417
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:07,730
Uh...

418
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,250
Loot merch from Offkai.

419
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,170
Also, can we get a green screen of long hair?

420
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,190
Doe kitty version?

421
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,050
Wow, that's a lot of requests, Mery.

422
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:15,870
Uh...

423
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:18,730
I'll think about it.

424
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:23,430
You know, if you just requested green screen, I'd be like, of course, Mery.

425
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,390
But then you were like, I want this and that.

426
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,870
And now I have to think about it, Mery.

427
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,410
Thank you for the Akasupa.

428
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,010
Akasupa, the greed.

429
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:37,950
The greed, yes.

430
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:38,210
Yes.

431
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,810
You got a little too greedy.

432
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:47,010
Um...

433
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:47,230
Um...

434
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:47,490
But yeah.

435
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:48,330
Uh...

436
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,270
Just a lot of going.

437
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,350
Like I said, like the last...

438
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,070
Oh...

439
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,650
The...

440
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,510
My greed is my talent to fall.

441
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,990
Mery, thank you for this super chat.

442
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:58,630
Thank you.

443
00:21:58,810 --> 00:21:59,370
Thank you.

444
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,370
Yeah, you stepped like...

445
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,310
You were one...

446
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:05,510
One toe a bit too far the line.

447
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:06,170
And I was like...

448
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:11,190
You had one chance, Mery.

449
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,530
And you fumbled it.

450
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:16,910
Um...

451
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,270
But the last, like...

452
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,550
Two days, it's just been like...

453
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,730
Work, work, work, work, work, work, work.

454
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,430
I was like...

455
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,750
I was like...

456
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:27,050
There's so much stuff to do.

457
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,090
Oh my god.

458
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,010
There's so much stuff.

459
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:30,990
Oh my god.

460
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:37,450
Mery just wanted in on NASCAR week.

461
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:38,710
Alright, let me see.

462
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:39,530
Oh!

463
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:40,670
Okay, also...

464
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,110
Good news about...

465
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:42,710
Uh...

466
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:45,210
Good news about the 3D concert.

467
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,470
But...

468
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:46,910
Uh...

469
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:47,890
The 3D concert.

470
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:49,890
But, uh...

471
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:50,550
Uh...

472
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,970
But...

473
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:52,570
Uh...

474
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:56,110
It will be most likely be out by end of August.

475
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,370
The Polish version.

476
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,150
And...

477
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,170
You are not...

478
00:22:59,170 --> 00:22:59,770
Oh my gosh.

479
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:00,750
Oh my...

480
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,030
I...

481
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:05,050
It was so hard to pick the encore song.

482
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,130
You are not ready for the song I've picked.

483
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:16,050
You are not ready for the song I've picked.

484
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,750
For the encore.

485
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,130
It could be anything.

486
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,550
It could be...

487
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,930
It could...

488
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:25,250
It could be anything.

489
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,970
But I feel like...

490
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,930
Whatever it could be...

491
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,530
Whatever you're thinking right now.

492
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:34,230
That would not be the encore song that actually plays.

493
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,910
It could be anything.

494
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,990
Iridescence, thank you for the Akasupa.

495
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:46,870
Thank you, thank you.

496
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:53,310
Are you telling me that infinite oil fairy money doesn't get me everything I want in the world?

497
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,190
No!

498
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,510
Then what's the point in having money?

499
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,550
What's the point?

500
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,670
Thank you for the Akasupa.

501
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,350
Thank you, thank you.

502
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,070
Random, thank you for the super chat.

503
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:08,670
Thank you, thank you.

504
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:14,990
Oh yeah, by the way, for the member goons out there in the Minecraft server, it's back up.

505
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:19,710
Okay, I may have made a big oopsie when I destroyed everyone.

506
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:29,010
I may or may not have made a huge oopsie when I Thanos snapped.

507
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:37,870
We destroyed the entire server inventory system because that has led us to actually...

508
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:41,650
We had to actually delete the whole server.

509
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:45,390
We had to delete the whole scene and restart everything.

510
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:51,350
So, you know when I was like...

511
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,130
You know when I just left?

512
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:56,550
So, after that...

513
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,930
Remember when I was like, oopsie, and I just left?

514
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:06,290
And I just left and ended the stream and be like, alright, we'll let the staff figure this out.

515
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:10,210
So, apparently, from what I was told, um...

516
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:15,730
From what I was told, um...

517
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,710
They had to basically recreate...

518
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:23,390
They basically had to like, uh, make an entire new scene.

519
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:27,030
Uh, because the server was now infinitely broken.

520
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:30,130
Because we wiped everybody's inventory!

521
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,130
So...

522
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,470
And, because of that, um...

523
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,110
We had to...

524
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:44,290
Yeah, we had to reconstruct reality for the server.

525
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:46,290
Um...

526
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,270
And, um...

527
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:55,270
Okay, I gave the order, but they had their own free will to not listen to me.

528
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,490
So, like, who was at fault here?

529
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:09,930
They didn't stop and think that maybe that was a bad idea.

530
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:25,130
Anyway, that's why.

531
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:37,450
Okay, but, like, you know, sometimes maybe I give bad orders and then it's up to the people below me to check on it.

532
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:41,930
To make this think, like, is that a good thing to do?

533
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,830
You know, the checks and...

534
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:49,430
What's the point of having checks and balances if they don't check or balance it?

535
00:26:58,910 --> 00:26:59,530
Anyway...

536
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,130
Um...

537
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,430
So, uh...

538
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:07,370
Because of that, they had to start an entire new seed.

539
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,530
The server was down for, like, two more days.

540
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,530
And, um...

541
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,670
But now everything's fine.

542
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:14,530
I think.

543
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:15,070
I...

544
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,430
Okay, maybe not everything is fine.

545
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,630
But, like...

546
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:24,250
Um... It's stable now.

547
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:27,750
It's... It's... It's stable now.

548
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:33,010
So, for those who have been waiting on the Minecraft server, the members Minecraft server, you can...

549
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:33,370
It's gone in.

550
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,230
Everything seems to be stable.

551
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,310
Um...

552
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,090
It wasn't at first, um...

553
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:38,910
What I've heard.

554
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:41,390
People were being sent to the void, from what I've heard.

555
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,110
But it should be good now.

556
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,730
It's... It's... It should be good now.

557
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:48,170
Um...

558
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:48,350
Thank you.

559
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:50,930
Thank you.

560
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:51,050
Thank you.

561
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,110
I won't use this ACA request.

562
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,870
You comply with Mehdi's...

563
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:57,650
Uh, to come... To request you to comply with Mehdi's request.

564
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,870
But only show Dad's a model.

565
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:00,410
Aren't you?

566
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,410
You know what?

567
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:01,690
Yeah.

568
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,630
You know what?

569
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,270
I fuck with that.

570
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:05,110
You're... You're alright.

571
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:05,770
You get that.

572
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,310
Alright, let's see.

573
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,650
Where's my green screen?

574
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,890
Technically, not green screen.

575
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,450
Because, like, I have too many colors.

576
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,190
Basically, so...

577
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:13,890
Um...

578
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:17,450
It's so hard to figure out what sc... What color to use for the green screen.

579
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:18,390
Alright.

580
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:20,890
Does this color work?

581
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,030
I think it does.

582
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:22,990
Alright.

583
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,010
Hello, Mr. Class President.

584
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:34,990
What is... What do you want to say today?

585
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,850
The magenta... The magenta screen.

586
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,750
Hello, Mr. Class President.

587
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:45,070
What wisdom do you want to share to the class?

588
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,070
Let me...

589
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:52,970
Brian, thank you for the super chat.

590
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,010
Thank you.

591
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,490
Too bad, Dragoons.

592
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,510
This twisted games needs to be reset.

593
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:02,150
We'll start over from zero with this version to entrust the future to the next generation.

594
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:03,970
Thank you for the super chat.

595
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:04,370
Thank you.

596
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:05,090
Thank you.

597
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,190
Uh...

598
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,530
Brady Boy, thank you for the super chat.

599
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:07,850
Thank you.

600
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:08,470
Thank you.

601
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:13,270
Jokey, last week they went against you and were forced to slay innocent chat members.

602
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,090
I think that's what it's on.

603
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:15,570
Yeah.

604
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,150
It's not my fault.

605
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,010
They're weak-willed.

606
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,750
Thank you for the super chat.

607
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:20,390
Thank you.

608
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:21,250
Thank you.

609
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:24,710
Alright.

610
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:24,870
Alright.

611
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:26,410
Um...

612
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:26,670
Okay.

613
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:27,490
But I'll...

614
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,930
I'll give you guys this for a little bit.

615
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:30,770
Hello, everybody.

616
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:31,770
Uh...

617
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:31,830
Zero!

618
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:32,990
Thank you for the magenta super!

619
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:33,830
Thank you.

620
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:34,610
Thank you.

621
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:37,190
Minecraft server team appreciation super.

622
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,710
Thank you for the magenta super.

623
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:38,990
No.

624
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:39,370
Thank you.

625
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:39,890
Thank you.

626
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:40,990
I really appreciate it.

627
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:41,710
Oh yeah, wait.

628
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,110
I have other green screen colors.

629
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:43,590
Okay.

630
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:46,530
This one's actually green, but I don't know if that works.

631
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,210
Oh my God.

632
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:47,750
It's...

633
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,190
That hurts.

634
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:52,810
This one's dark green, but I also don't know if that works though.

635
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:53,450
But...

636
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,410
Here's...

637
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:57,090
Here's dark green, just in case.

638
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:01,050
I have all the colors.

639
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:02,510
Uh...

640
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,030
Well, that...

641
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:03,510
That was it.

642
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:04,430
That was all...

643
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,870
That was all the colors, guys.

644
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:06,610
Alright.

645
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:08,450
Back to the chatting screen.

646
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,910
Where's my chatting screen?

647
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:10,590
Wow!

648
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:12,510
Uh...

649
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,310
Here it is.

650
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,570
I'll be back here.

651
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:17,550
Hello, everybody.

652
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,090
I'm back.

653
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,110
Dark green works?

654
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,070
Okay, that's good to know.

655
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:26,010
But yeah, it's hard to figure out what color works because I just have too many colors on me.

656
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:27,310
Uh...

657
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:31,130
But what else do I want to really update you guys about?

658
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:31,890
Um...

659
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:35,350
I haven't been giving much dad updates because he's just been, like, sleeping.

660
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:35,970
I...

661
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:36,330
I...

662
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:37,090
Basically...

663
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:39,150
Okay, so I ordered a little playpen.

664
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,730
Like, you know, those little children playpen, but for dogs.

665
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:42,790
Um...

666
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:45,310
I've had that order, like, uh...

667
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,950
A couple of months ago when he first had his back surgery, but then he recovered really fast.

668
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,170
Like, you know, because I...

669
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:53,490
I gave him to the dog sitter to look after him for the first two weeks.

670
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:55,850
And after that, he didn't really need a dog...

671
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,950
Like, he didn't really need to, like, rest anymore.

672
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,010
Or, like, not move.

673
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,810
So, like...

674
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,230
But then, like, you know...

675
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:01,770
Um...

676
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:03,950
You know, he's, like, recovering from, um...

677
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:05,390
His...

678
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:05,910
Either his...

679
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:07,850
I hope it's a sprained neck muscle.

680
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:09,450
Um...

681
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,050
Um...

682
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:12,350
He hasn't really recovered that much.

683
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:13,730
Um...

684
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:14,850
Since, like, uh...

685
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,390
He's still limping a little bit.

686
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,370
But I just assumed...

687
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:20,530
Because the vet did say it was four weeks of rest.

688
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,930
So I'm hoping that things will look better...

689
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,990
Within the second or third week.

690
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:27,750
Um...

691
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:30,130
But I'm taking him to get a CT scan tomorrow.

692
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,250
Just to be sure.

693
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:32,770
Uh...

694
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:33,110
Uh...

695
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:33,830
Just to be sure.

696
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,530
You know, I don't...

697
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:35,570
I don't want to risk anything.

698
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:36,470
Um...

699
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,110
So I just...

700
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,970
I'm taking him to get a CT scan tomorrow.

701
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:39,630
Uh...

702
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:40,070
But yes, no.

703
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:42,490
I had to build a fucking playpen for him.

704
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:44,750
And he's, like, enclosed in his own little baby jail.

705
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:45,650
Wait, let me...

706
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:46,930
I took a photo earlier.

707
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,510
Let me see if I can find it.

708
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:51,190
He's, like, in his fucking little baby jail right now.

709
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:52,470
Let me see if I have it.

710
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,670
I know I took a photo of this and, like...

711
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:55,630
Sent it to a friend.

712
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,550
Because I was like...

713
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,570
There he is.

714
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:58,490
Uh...

715
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:00,950
Imprisoned for his crimes.

716
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:01,730
Of...

717
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:03,170
Of being old, I guess.

718
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:04,170
I am...

719
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:12,330
His crimes of being old.

720
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:15,610
All right.

721
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:15,890
All right.

722
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:16,290
Let me...

723
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:16,910
I saved it.

724
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:20,230
I need a double check if there's, like...

725
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:23,830
I need a double check to make sure there's, like, no reflections and stuff like that.

726
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,210
Uh...

727
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,150
All right.

728
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:27,050
His...

729
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:27,950
His return.

730
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,430
In baby jail.

731
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:30,070
All right.

732
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,550
This is basically what it looks like.

733
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:36,030
But it's, it's like, it's literally like a square.

734
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:57,340
Alright, look it, this is his little baby jail that I like kept him locked up in.

735
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,340
Cause like, I didn't have like an actual cage for him.

736
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,340
Cause they were saying like, oh, just put him in a cage.

737
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:06,300
And, um, it's not a prison!

738
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,220
It's a retirement home!

739
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,760
Essentially, it's like a retirement home.

740
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:14,080
Um, dude, it's, and so he won!

741
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,880
That's the whole point!

742
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,760
It's the whole point so he doesn't move, guys!

743
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,380
Uh, he has to, we know if we free him, he'll move!

744
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:29,760
The whole point is to restrict him from moving!

745
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:36,140
Uh, I can, um, I can almost pick up the bingo smell.

746
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,080
He free him!

747
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,720
He, it's not my, okay, okay, okay, okay, I swear, okay.

748
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,460
Like, he is so stubborn.

749
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,900
He is so fucking stubborn.

750
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,700
Okay, so I was telling this story to my friend.

751
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:54,120
Because I was like, I was like, why is he like this?

752
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,560
So, I was, it was just like, you know, it's med time, you know?

753
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,060
It's like, ring, ring, ring!

754
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,000
It's time for your daily meds!

755
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:02,600
Grandpa!

756
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:12,760
But, anyway, so I was like, prepping his, like, pills and stuff, his medication, like, his painkillers.

757
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:19,440
And this fucker was like, because he, he's, he's sometimes he get, like, super excited about his medicine, medication.

758
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,780
Because he gets to have, like, treats and stuff with his medication.

759
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,440
So, he knows.

760
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,220
He's like, yay!

761
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,900
And then, like, because it's, like, neck muscles.

762
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:31,440
Like, whatever, whatever it is, it relates to his neck muscles.

763
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,780
Um, like, the pain.

764
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,660
And he kept, like, looking up.

765
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,700
And then I hear him crying out while he's, and he does it, like, three times.

766
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,660
I was like, stop looking up!

767
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,640
I was like, what?

768
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,220
Stop!

769
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,900
You know it hurts!

770
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,660
Stop looking up!

771
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,440
Like, he's like, he's like, I wouldn't look at the food!

772
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,680
And he's like, and I'm like, okay, okay, at least it's, like, one time.

773
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,540
And then he doesn't get, it's like, and I'm like, stop!

774
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:05,840
I was like, it's, I'm just like, please!

775
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,640
I was like, stop!

776
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,220
You're making me worried!

777
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,040
Stop hurting yourself!

778
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,060
Um, is he stupid?

779
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,720
No, the thing is, I wasn't even getting the treats.

780
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:28,460
I was literally prepping the medication because I had to cut the pills and everything.

781
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,080
I'm like, I'm trying to help you!

782
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:37,680
Um, uh, ABR, thank you for the super chat.

783
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,560
Thank you, thank you.

784
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,980
Dad's retirement prison.

785
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,560
Cindy, thank you for the super chat.

786
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,540
Thank you, thank you.

787
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,840
Sent to jail by dictating Toki.

788
00:35:48,440 --> 00:36:04,320
Um, but, like, uh, uh, the good thing is that, um, cause, like, you know when they're, I don't know if you guys know this, but when a dog gets, like, injured or, like, is in, like, pain, a little pain or stuff, they are, like, super submissive.

789
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:15,380
Um, and they don't want to, like, they're, like, oh, I don't mean, they're, like, oh, I don't mean to, I don't mean to do anything, sir, sorry, I had good, have a nice rest of your day, you know, like, you know, like, you see other dogs and they're, like,

790
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,760
oh, sir, sorry, have a good rest of your day, sir, I didn't mean nothing.

791
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:24,920
After you, like, they, they don't want to, like, engage or anything with other dogs.

792
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:39,480
And like... so... Before dad... before like dad got... like got like whatever it is with his neck... I mean no harm, please leave me like that.

793
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:43,480
So he would always aggress other dogs.

794
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:54,900
Like he would... like when he's on his... you know when we're walking to the dog park, he always like run... like if he's on a leash and he sees another dog on a leash, he always like runs up to them and aggress them and be like...

795
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,760
Get out of the way!

796
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,000
This is my hallway!

797
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:00,660
Leave!

798
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:01,620
Move!

799
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:07,240
And then like... even when I pick him up, he'd be like... Yes!

800
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:07,660
Right!

801
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,060
Walk away!

802
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,140
Every time.

803
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,460
Like every fucking time.

804
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,380
And... even the big dogs too.

805
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,220
Even the big dogs.

806
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,760
And then he baits the big dogs.

807
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,640
That's the worst part.

808
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:21,780
He baits... Actually no, he baits both big dogs and small dogs of all sizes.

809
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,660
Like sometimes he'd be like...

810
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:23,880
Hi!

811
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,520
I'm friendly!

812
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,800
And then they like...

813
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,560
Walk up to him.

814
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,540
Give... try to give him a sniff on the snout.

815
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,800
And then he's like...

816
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,640
And then he like gets... lets them get closer and he's like... he's like...

817
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,040
GET OUTTA HERE!!!

818
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,720
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

819
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,560
And like he barks in his... their faces.

820
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,820
Like the moment they...

821
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,920
Like get close to him.

822
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,640
He's like... Oh hey friend!

823
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:53,640
And then tries to sniff and he's like...

824
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,300
He's like... FUCK YOU!!!

825
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,700
Like in their faces.

826
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,200
Um...

827
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,100
And... So he would do that.

828
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:00,780
Like...

829
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,420
He would fucking... He would...

830
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,820
Um... do that sometimes.

831
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,860
But ever since he got like... injured...

832
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,840
He would just be like...

833
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,360
Oh hello!

834
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,320
Ha ha ha!

835
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,000
Oh this... Oh please!

00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:14,720
He he he he!

838
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,020
Oh!

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,580
Oh don't... Don't get near me!

840
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:16,840
Oh!

841
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,480
If you wanna get near me that's okay!

842
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,000

851
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,100

853
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:38,200
Uh... To the dog park cause I'm trying to like make sure to restrict his movement...

854
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,160
As much as possible.

00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,440
And... So that's why he's in baby jail right now.

856
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,840
Like... That's why...

857
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,020
That's why he's in baby jail at the moment.

But, but, Tokyo, we're a team.

Long story.

00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,020
This was a very long story to tell.

889
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:07,880
A very short thing.

890
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,800
Anyway, so, uh...

891
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:25,640
Basically, he, I was, I had him on my arms, and we bumped into another dog, and he started barking at this, the dogs while we were walking past, and I was so happy.

892
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,200
Like, usually I'd be like, why are you like this?

893
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,520
But I'm like, oh my god, yes, there's knife in him.

894
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:34,280
You know, he was like, I, he's like, oh my, he's feeling it again, guys.

895
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,820
He's actually, um...

896
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,720
Alimony for VTubers' dog.

897
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,500
I hate post-money.

898
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,720
That's right.

899
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,000
Where is the alimony, Chad?

900
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,540
I got it.

901
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,420
How else will we pay for dad's support?

902
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:03,100
But as nature is healing, he barked at a dog while in my arms.

903
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:10,640
So, like, I take that as a, I take that as a good sign that he's actually, like, recovering and stuff.

904
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,840
So, yippee!

905
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,880
Um, I'm happy about that.

906
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,560
But yes, there he is in his little prison.

907
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:23,000
Uh, he's like, finally I have high ground.

908
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,620
He's been having, he's been enjoying it a lot.

909
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,540
Because, like, I usually don't carry him around.

910
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:34,000
Because I feel like when you carry small dogs around, it gives them a bigger ego.

911
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,460
And, um, what's the word?

912
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,480
It makes them, uh...

913
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,940
What's that word?

914
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,820
It makes them more arrogant.

915
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,860
And more egotistical.

916
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,300
Uh, so that's why I try to avoid...

917
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,500
Uh, because they're, like, I feel like they get more spoiled the higher, the taller they get.

918
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,700
Uh, yeah.

919
00:41:54,940 --> 00:42:05,120
Yeah, they, they, they get, I, I feel like small dogs, when you pick them up too much, they get more over, they get more spoiled and, like, um, arrogant too.

920
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,800
So I, I, or entitled, yeah.

921
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,200
So I try to avoid picking dad up.

922
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:15,940
Um, so, but, um, lately, you know, uh, he's been loving it.

923
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,440
He's been loving it so much.

924
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,980
He's like, I'm so tall now.

925
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:26,440
Uh, he, every time I, like, I, like, bent down, he instantly, like, like, jumps into my arms.

926
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,620
And he's like, yippee.

927
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,600
Uh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

928
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,220
I get to be a tall boy.

929
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:31,960
Uh,

930
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:48,940
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

931
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,700
What's going on with him at the moment?

932
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:54,080
Uh, he'll be at the dog sitter, uh, tomorrow as well.

933
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,480
Um, just cause, like, you know, he deserves to be spoiled.

934
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:02,360
He deserves, like, um, you know, he deserves, like, to be, like, extra spoiled.

935
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,540
And he loves a dog sitter.

936
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:08,880
So I figured, like, um, you know, uh, putting him at the dog sitter would be a good idea.

937
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:11,520
Uh, b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b.

938
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,000
Yeah, that's why you haven't heard him barking, because the... Okay.

939
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:20,500
He doesn't wake me up in the morning anymore, which is nice.

940
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,220
I've actually been able to sleep in.

941
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:31,560
Because his, like, feeding schedule is now... Because of the medication and stuff, like the pain meds.

942
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:35,020
One of the pain meds gets him a little sedated.

943
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,140
So he makes him, like, super sleepy.

944
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,860
So he's been sleeping in more because of it.

945
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,420
So now, it's really fucked up.

946
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,780
But through medication, we fixed his eating schedule.

947
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:55,360
So he doesn't wake me up at 6 in the morning anymore.

948
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:06,020
Like, that was what it took to make it so that I don't have to wake up at 6 in the morning to give him food.

949
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:11,700
So now, now I can actually wake up at, like, 10 or 11 a.m.

950
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:15,140
With the... The answer was drugs, Doki.

951
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,360
It's one weakness.

952
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:19,940
Drugs.

953
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,360
Yeah, so...

954
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,020
So, um...

955
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,280
There's...

956
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,580
So, that's, like...

957
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:28,740
I guess that's the positive.

958
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,100
I get to...

959
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:33,060
I get to sleep a little longer now.

960
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:35,140
Um...

961
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,320
Alright, let me...

962
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,000
I have, like, a list of...

963
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,840
Updates and stuff.

964
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,480
Uh...

965
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,120
Oh, yeah.

966
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,200
Um...

967
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,360
Also, like...

968
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,300
I actually learned...

969
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,720
I had to, like, learn a new way to pick up dad.

970
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,000
Because, like...

971
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,140
Because, like...

972
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:56,980
For long boys, there's actually, like...

973
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:58,600
Um...

974
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,760
There's, like, a specific way...

975
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,380
You have...

976
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,480
Not have to...

977
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,660
But it's, like...

978
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:04,740
Suggested.

979
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:05,220
You know?

980
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,040
To, like...

981
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,520
And how to pick them up.

982
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:08,600
Because they're so long.

983
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,240
I have to Google image this.

984
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,740
Because I was so fucking confused.

985
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,480
Because I was, like...

986
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,100
It's, like, how do I fucking...

987
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,300
Because, like...

988
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:17,960
Um...

989
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,500
It's more so of, like...

990
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,820
I guess, like...

991
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,400
As they get older...

992
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,540
For spying stuff.

993
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,300
Yeah, you have to hold...

994
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,140
Okay, so this is basically...

995
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,720
I have to Google this.

996
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,940
Because I was so confused.

997
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,240
Um...

998
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:29,800
Because, like...

999
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,280
How I usually carry them...

1000
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,620
Is that...

1001
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:34,140
Uh...

1002
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:34,700
But this is...

1003
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:35,280
This is it.

1004
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,380
It's just so weird.

1005
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,060
Like, you have to...

1006
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:38,340
Grab their crotch.

1007
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:38,820
And...

1008
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:39,480
Because I...

1009
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:39,980
I don't...

1010
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,980
I have to...

1011
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,180
I have to be, like...

1012
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:46,700
How to pick up a wiener dog.

1013
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:48,800
And then you have to, like...

1014
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,260
Grab their crotch.

1015
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,420
Yeah, and then, like...

1016
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,060
Put the other hand...

1017
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:54,680
Uh...

1018
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,920
Underneath the chest.

1019
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:57,220
The...

1020
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,720
How to hold...

1021
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:02,720
Your...

1022
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,180
Um...

1023
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:03,580
No, I...

1024
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:04,520
I didn't pick him up.

1025
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:04,920
Like...

1026
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,340
I pick him up, like...

1027
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:06,720
Oh, yeah.

1028
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,860
How do I describe it?

1029
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:09,680
Like...

1030
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:10,660
Um...

1031
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:12,700
I have two arms under...

1032
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:13,480
But I...

1033
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,700
I don't grab his...

1034
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,680
To grab...

1035
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,960
To pick up your wiener...

1036
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,780
First off...

1037
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,340
You gotta grab the wiener...

1038
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:23,040
But, like...

1039
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:23,740
Okay...

1040
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:24,460
I...

1041
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:26,840
I don't know how to explain how I pick...

1042
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,740
Okay, so...

1043
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:30,160
He's, like, on my arm in the end.

1044
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:30,720
Like, he'll...

1045
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,260
He rests his two legs...

1046
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:33,500
On my arm.

1047
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,900
Like, his front paws.

1048
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:35,480
But, like...

1049
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:35,720
I...

1050
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,560
I never picked him up like that before.

1051
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:38,520
So...

1052
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:41,860
The wiener...

1053
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:44,200
So I have to learn a new way...

1054
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,540
I have to learn a new way...

1055
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:48,620
To hold dad...

1056
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:49,040
Because, like...

1057
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,460
I wanted to be as...

1058
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:52,120
Careful as possible...

1059
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:53,660
Um...

1060
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:55,540
I wanted to make sure that...

1061
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:55,860
Uh...

1062
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:58,320
I actually do not like it like that...

1063
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,480
As a professional dog lifter...

1064
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:05,100
Secure...

1065
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:06,400
Secure...

1066
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,600
The wiener...

1067
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,280
So...

1068
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,320
Because it supports both ends...

1069
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:16,560
But...

1070
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,560
I do like...

1071
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:18,140
But it's like...

1072
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:19,040
My arm is, like...

1073
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,040
On his rear legs...

1074
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:21,960
Versus, like...

1075
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:22,880
On his crouch...

1076
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:23,180
Like...

1077
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:24,600
That's how I used to hold him...

1078
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:24,800
You know?

1079
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,060
Because, you know...

1080
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:28,880
Like, I don't know...

1081
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:29,060
I...

1082
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:31,540
I was just like...

1083
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:32,960
I don't know...

1084
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:33,460
I...

1085
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:34,320
Like, you know...

1086
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,180
In your head...

1087
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:37,540
You don't think about...

1088
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,580
Like that...

1089
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:39,180
You know...

1090
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,520
Like holding a dog...

1091
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,380
Like that...

1092
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:43,480
Yeah...

1093
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:47,920
So I...

1094
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,760
I had to learn a new way...

1095
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:50,480
To like...

1096
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,380
Pick him up...

1097
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:52,360
Because I wanted to be sure...

1098
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,920
He had as least...

1099
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:54,600
As...

1100
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,000
Um...

1101
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,040
Little pressure...

1102
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,400
As possible...

1103
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,200
Um...

1104
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,460
On his, like...

1105
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,580
Neck and legs...

1106
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:01,620
So...

1107
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:06,120
Um...

1108
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:07,340
Um...

1109
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:08,380
So I had to...

1110
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,260
Because like...

1111
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,720
In the past...

1112
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,240
Like...

1113
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:11,680
Uh...

1114
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,680
But when I got him back...

1115
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,240
From...

1116
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,240
The dog sitter...

1117
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,360
After his back surgery...

1118
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,420
He didn't need to be picked up anymore...

1119
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:19,100
Um...

1120
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:19,860
So like...

1121
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:21,360
I didn't have to worry about that...

1122
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:21,980
But like...

1123
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:22,600
For now...

1124
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,380
I actually have to pick him up and stuff...

1125
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,420
And I got really worried...

1126
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:26,100
I got scared...

1127
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,380
Because I don't want to pick him up wrong...

1128
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:29,740
That will put pressure on his front legs...

1129
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,660
So I actually...

1130
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:31,300
I was like...

1131
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:32,060
Googling up like...

1132
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:33,280
Proper techniques...

1133
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,540
To pick up a...

1134
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:36,400
To hold a wiener dog...

1135
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:36,800
And...

1136
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,760
And literally all of them was like...

1137
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,100
They're like...

1138
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:43,760
Or like...

1139
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,080
Okay, this was the other way...

1140
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,360
Um...

1141
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,140
This was the other way...

1142
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:48,900
But...

1143
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,120
It's also very similar...

1144
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,620
This is the other technique...

1145
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:53,600
That I found...

1146
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,480
I'll show you guys...

1147
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,440
Uh...

1148
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,120
Let's see...

1149
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,160
It's a little small though...

1150
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:02,060
So...

1151
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:02,880
But...

1152
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,500
This was the other way...

1153
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,520
To hold them up...

1154
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,020
So you...

1155
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,020
You...

1156
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,300
Cup the ass...

1157
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:08,420
And...

1158
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,740
The wiener meta...

1159
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,540
So you...

1160
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:13,620
You...

1161
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:14,460
Basically...

1162
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:15,500
The first off...

1163
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,320
You start off the same...

1164
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,840
But then your hand moves from the crouch...

1165
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:20,520
To the ass...

1166
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,100
Yes...

1167
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:21,420
So...

1168
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:22,120
To...

1169
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,300
To the butt...

1170
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:23,900
So like...

1171
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,740
How to hold the shotgun...

1172
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:26,600
It's so...

1173
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,120
Yeah, you...

1174
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:27,620
You...

1175
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:28,460
Cup the cake...

1176
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,260
So like...

1177
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:30,620
It's a little...

1178
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:31,300
The...

1179
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:31,560
The...

1180
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,560
A different meta...

1181
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:33,780
In terms of how...

1182
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:34,280
Um...

1183
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,240
How to hold it...

1184
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:35,980
But apparently...

1185
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,060
The other one...

1186
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:38,780
The other one is more...

1187
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:40,800
Um...

1188
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,380
The other one supports the back...

1189
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,460
The spine more...

1190
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,440
Lock and load your wiener...

1191
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,140
Dog...

1192
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:47,400
Ha ha ha ha...

1193
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:48,260
Ha ha ha...

1194
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:50,000
Why he's so...

1195
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:50,420
What...

1196
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:52,860
I like...

1197
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:53,920
Yeah, the shock...

1198
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,620
The lock and load...

1199
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:56,560
Shotgun...

1200
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,720
Toe key...

1201
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,240
Ha ha ha ha...

1202
00:49:59,240 --> 00:49:59,740
That's...

1203
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:02,120
Yeah, as if you're holding a shotgun...

1204
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:02,540
I mean...

1205
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:03,040
I mean...

1206
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,240
It does look like you're holding a shotgun...

1207
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,500
To be fair...

1208
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:06,880
Uh...

1209
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,280
Captain, welcome to the tomato fight...

1210
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,420
Welcome, welcome...

1211
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:11,480
Reload...

1212
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:16,900
So...

1213
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:17,940
But yeah, that is the...

1214
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:18,940
Wiener dog meta...

1215
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:21,300
Uh...

1216
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,080
But also like...

1217
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:23,720
Also...

1218
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,240
Okay, I need to rant about this a little bit...

1219
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:26,920
Uh...

1220
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:27,660
Um...

1221
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:30,240
But I'd be going to the bank yesterday...

1222
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:30,960
Um...

1223
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,380
And I was going to be like...

1224
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:33,020
You know, I'm going to...

1225
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:33,900
There was like...

1226
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:34,400
I wanted...

1227
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,780
There was like a dessert place...

1228
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:37,140
A dessert coffee place...

1229
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,140
Near my bank...

1230
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:38,400
It's like...

1231
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:38,600
You know what?

1232
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,980
I'm going to reward myself...

1233
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:42,260
I'm going to...

1234
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:44,320
I'm going to reward myself for...

1235
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,300
Walking...

1236
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,200
10 minutes to the bank...

1237
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,620
That long...

1238
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:52,880
Hard walk...

1239
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,640
Of 10 minutes...

1240
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:54,580
You know...

1241
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:57,620
So...

1242
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:58,020
Um...

1243
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:58,540
I was like...

1244
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:00,920
There's a dessert place nearby...

1245
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:01,660
So...

1246
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:03,600
So strong and brave...

1247
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,580
Doki...

1248
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:04,840
Uh...

1249
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,760
As the one does...

1250
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,560
Oh...

1251
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:07,980
Those...

1252
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,360
10 long...

1253
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,700
Minutes in the sun...

1254
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,080
And outside...

1255
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:12,700
Oh...

1256
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,220
Good job, Doki...

1257
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:16,340
You deserve a little treat...

1258
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:16,520
Uh...

1259
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,620
Such a strong woman...

1260
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:19,040
Uh...

1261
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:19,360
Uh...

1262
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:19,860
Uh...

1263
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:20,960
Uh...

1264
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:21,000
Uh...

1265
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:21,320
Anyway...

1266
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,220
But...

1267
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:23,160
Um...

1268
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,220
Oh my gosh...

1269
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:24,400
I...

1270
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,600
I think I forgot that...

1271
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,520
Because I think university started for some people already...

1272
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,340
And like the moment I went in...

1273
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:32,040
It was literally just filled with...

1274
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,220
I think college students on their fucking...

1275
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:35,340
MacBooks...

1276
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:35,660
Just...

1277
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:38,540
Taking every chair and table...

1278
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:39,320
Because I...

1279
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:39,720
I don't...

1280
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:40,660
I just wanted to...

1281
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:42,040
Eat like a little dessert...

1282
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:42,980
On a table...

1283
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,220
And it was literally...

1284
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:46,540
Every table was just filled with students...

1285
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:48,120
On their fucking MacBooks...

1286
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:48,480
Uh...

1287
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,560
I was like...

1288
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,500
I was like...

1289
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,400
Where can I sit...

1290
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,980
A paying customer...

1291
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,000
And I'm joking...

1292
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:57,980
I'm just...

1293
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:58,260
I...

1294
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,480
I'm joking...

1295
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,260
I'm joking...

1296
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,900
They deserve to be there, okay?

1297
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:03,680
They deserve.

1298
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:13,700
But all I'm saying is that I, a paid customer, who wouldn't loiter longer than they're supposed to be!

1299
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:25,300
I can't believe it, Doki hates education.

1300
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,300
Damn kids!

1301
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:36,060
But anyway, I was just, I was mad.

1302
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:41,560
Because I was like, I worked so hard, walking this 10 minutes to the bank.

1303
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:52,580
And all I wanted to do was sit at a table for maybe 20 to 30 minutes.

1304
00:52:53,860 --> 00:53:02,140
Maybe 20 to 30 minutes eating something that, eating a dessert and coffee as well.

1305
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:11,640
But yeah, I was just like, I was just like, oh my gosh, it was just all MacBooks.

1306
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,300
I'm surprised people, I guess it's more efficient.

1307
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:19,120
I don't know, when I, I mean I used a MacBook too, in university.

1308
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:24,480
But I only did it because it was like, everyone else was doing it, in a way.

1309
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,400
Like, you know how like, peer pressure?

1310
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,800
And like, my parents were like, you need a MacBook for this.

1311
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,280
Um, you need a MacBook if you're gonna be taking notes and stuff.

1312
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:40,340
Um, and uh, no, I was a Mac, I used a MacBook.

1313
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,460
A Mac, uh, or just a Mac, I don't know.

1314
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:48,480
I felt like it was just like, it was just like a thing to do in university.

1315
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:51,080
Like, it didn't matter if it's like better or worse.

1316
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,860
Like, every student just had a Mac.

1317
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:54,860
For some fucking reason.

1318
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:00,300
Um, um, but yeah.

1319
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:05,600
Anyway, I was sad I couldn't get my, couldn't get my, my dessert and coffee.

1320
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,420
So I got the second, the worst thing, Timbits.

1321
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:09,680
Ha ha ha ha!

1322
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:10,860
Out of Tim Hortons.

1323
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,380
And an ice cap.

1324
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,340
That was so sad.

1325
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:19,840
I was like, if I'm gonna walk and eat, I might as well just go to Tim Hortons.

1326
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,300
Ha ha ha ha!

1327
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:24,620
For the real walking and eating vibe.

1328
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:25,840
Ha ha ha ha!

1329
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:27,160
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1330
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:28,720
Ha ha ha ha!

1331
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:34,320
I'm, I'm just, I'm just like, you know, I'm not, cause like, I wanted to get like, something nice and fancy.

1332
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:36,160
At like, in a coffee shop.

1333
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:43,320
But then I was just like, okay, if I'm gonna be walking, walking and eating, I might as well get Tim Hortons.

1334
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:48,640
For the, that's the real walking, uh, walking dessert.

1335
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,340
Um, Ellie, thank you for the super chat.

1336
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,240
Thank you, thank you.

1337
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:54,200
I feel like I need to let you know.

1338
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:57,760
My internet cut out and all I was able to hear was Google how to hold your wiener.

1339
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,360
Thanks internet.

1340
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,000
Thank you for the super chat.

1341
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,180
Thank you, thank you.

1342
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:15,840
No, I, to me this is like, like, for those who don't know what Tim Hortons are, it's basically like, what, it's, it's like, I would, it's, it's cheap.

1343
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,660
But it could be cheaper.

1344
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,520
Cause like, the coffee's terrible.

1345
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:29,120
Um, and like, the coffee is just like, it's so watered down.

1346
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:30,420
The coffee is so bad.

1347
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:33,600
No, it's, it doesn't even deserve to be called Starbucks.

1348
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:38,520
Cause at least like, Starbucks has like, actual like, drinks and stuff.

1349
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:44,780
But like, oh my gosh, it's, it's a Canadian Duncans.

1350
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:51,800
I think, yeah, Canadian, it's basically Canadian Duncans, but a, a tier lower than that.

1351
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:56,140
The only good thing from Tim Hortons is literally the ice cap.

1352
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:59,920
Yeah, because in like, Timbits, you just like, feel like shit.

1353
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:05,520
Like, if you, if you just feel like shit, just Timbits.

1354
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:14,480
And, um, and, um, but the only good thing is like, are like, ice caps, which is like, ice cappuccinos.

1355
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:19,440
But, the only reason why it's good is because they overload it with so much fucking sugar.

1356
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:24,240
And caffeine is the only reason why it's good.

1357
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:26,800
It's, there's just so much fucking sugar.

1358
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:28,820
Hehehehehehe in it.

1359
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:33,360
Um, um, but Timbits are alright.

1360
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:36,080
As long as they have like, a good selection of Timbits.

1361
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:40,620
For those who don't know what Timbits are, they're basically, um, donut holes.

1362
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,020
Like, you know, like, you know, we're like, where do the holes go in the donuts?

1363
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:45,920
That's, that's basically the Timbits.

1364
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:49,040
They're the little donut holes, um, that they make.

1365
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,600
Um, and they're pretty good.

1366
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,740
And also, you feel like absolute shit.

1367
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:53,660
Hehehehe.

1368
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:54,900
You grab a Timbit.

1369
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:58,900
AKZ, thank you for the, uh, five gifted chips.

1370
00:56:59,020 --> 00:56:59,680
Thank you, thank you.

1371
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:00,900
Yeah, it varies by location.

1372
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,540
I mean, that's all franchises though.

1373
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:06,220
Uh, because I, uh, for those who don't know how franchises work.

1374
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:13,280
Um, um, franchises are basically like, um, simple business stuff.

1375
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,340
Uh, business lessons to all you guys.

1376
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,740
But, anyone can start a franchise.

1377
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,300
So, you just gotta apply for it.

1378
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,080
Like, you know, apply from the main company.

1379
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:27,560
And then, like, they just send you all the, they just send you like, the ingredients.

1380
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:28,800
The food.

1381
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,440
Um, like the uniforms, the pamphlets and everything.

1382
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,660
But you pick like, the location.

1383
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:36,880
And like, how it's run.

1384
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,740
So, and spend the money.

1385
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,400
They just send you like, the equipment and stuff.

1386
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,880
Yeah, so they're owned locally.

1387
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,120
And they just license it.

1388
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:45,960
It's like an IP.

1389
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,040
They just license it.

1390
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:53,100
I, I can technically, I can technically like, buy a Tim Hortons right now.

1391
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:58,440
Yeah, you have to, yeah.

1392
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:00,220
And you buy the supplies from them.

1393
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:04,020
Like, technically, I can run, uh, Tim Hortons right now.

1394
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,120
And be like, hey, this is my Tim Hortons.

1395
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:07,600
Can you guys go support me?

1396
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:14,220
Like, anyone can do it.

1397
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:18,420
Please don't, please don't buy a Tim Hortons.

1398
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:21,540
Please don't buy a franchise, Toki.

1399
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,780
Anyway, uh, but yeah.

1400
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:29,920
So that's how franchises work.

1401
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:37,180
So it depends on, basically depends on like, uh, um, like, you know, who's running it.

1402
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:41,540
So if there's a, if you're like, oh, I went to this plate, this fast food place.

1403
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:44,020
Um, and like, it was terrible.

1404
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:48,560
Um, I'm never going to any other fast food place like this again.

1405
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,540
It just, it usually might just be like, whoever was running that one.

1406
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:57,380
Um, cause like, they're the ones that's in charge of it, not the actual company itself.

1407
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:10,720
Um, I actually, it's also like, why, I know like, I heard like, stories about how like, McDonald's ice cream machines are always broken, um, in the past.

1408
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,220
But they recently fixed that issue.

1409
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:23,440
But the reason why McDonald's ice cream places were always broken, was because they can only buy the equipment to make McDonald's ice cream from this one company.

1410
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:28,860
And only this one company can fix the McDonald's ice cream machines.

1411
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:34,160
So, you can't like, outsource it to any other like, place to fix it.

1412
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:40,600
It's only, you can only like, hire the company itself to fix the ice cream machine.

1413
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:43,580
And I was like that, yeah, the monopoly is fucking crazy.

1414
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:47,700
Cause it's like, um, part of the contract and the license and everything.

1415
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:50,440
So, they recently fixed that.

1416
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:58,320
So now, now, now, ice cream, the ice cream machine can be fixed by, um, by any company you want now.

1417
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:03,540
I don't know what, maybe they paid them like, I don't know, billions of dollars to be like, stop that.

1418
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:10,340
Cause like, they're like, stop, you're actually like, hurting our business.

1419
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:14,700
I don't know what the contract they did.

1420
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,160
But, now it's different.

1421
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:17,940
Now you can like, fix it.

1422
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,620
You can hire anyone to fix it now.

1423
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:24,880
Yeah, oh yeah.

1424
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:27,340
I mean, I won't be surprised if it became a lawsuit.

1425
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:30,000
It's really, really like, whoever has the better lawyer.

1426
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,400
Uh, next thing, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1427
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,180
I can feel your manager's fear from here.

1428
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:38,780
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1429
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:42,500
Okay, even the employees can now, uh, repair it too.

1430
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:47,680
Uh, oh yeah, speaking of like, dogs earlier.

1431
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:52,320
I was watching a YouTube shorts of like, this lady feeding their fucking Doberman.

1432
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:59,220
And like, I did not realize how much big dogs have to eat.

1433
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:02,840
To like, be healthy and like, satisfied.

1434
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:05,460
Because I've owned small dogs my entire life.

1435
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:09,400
And by small dogs, I mean I've owned wiener dogs my entire life.

1436
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:13,560
So like, yeah, so I was watching this lady literally like...

1437
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:16,940
Like, I know, it's like, not even like, a big thick dog.

1438
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,140
It was like a...

1439
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:20,200
It was just like, I guess like an extra...

1440
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:20,880
I guess he was...

1441
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,420
I guess the Doberman was like, super fit.

1442
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,600
Um, but...

1443
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:26,160
Um...

1444
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:29,480
Um, I was like, watching her feed the Doberman.

1445
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:34,300
And she was like, plastering it with like, five different kinds of meat.

1446
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:38,080
And then like, and then like, a fucking crocodile's foot.

1447
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,280
Because she was like, oh yeah, she...

1448
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,900
My, my Doberman loves crunchy food.

1449
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,320
And I was like, what?

1450
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,120
I was like...

1451
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,480
I was like...

1452
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,260
I was like...

1453
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:50,780
They can, they can do that?

1454
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:52,700
I was so...

1455
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:53,620
Like...

1456
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:55,020
Okay, I'll show you guys the video.

1457
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:55,940
I was watching it.

1458
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:57,160
I was like, holy fuck.

1459
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,120
I was like, oh my god.

1460
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:02,680
This dog can fucking eat.

1461
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:04,160
Um...

1462
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:04,780
Did I like it?

1463
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:05,360
Oh, here you go.

1464
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,260
Duck crunch.

1465
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:07,220
Here we go.

1466
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:07,720
You know what?

1467
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:09,900
I'll let you guys hear the video too.

1468
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:10,640
Fuck it.

1469
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,340
Haha.

1470
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:15,060
Um...

1471
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:15,380
Here.

1472
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:17,040
I'm not gonna show it because I have to...

1473
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:17,540
Actually, yeah.

1474
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:20,980
I have to like, redo my, my, um...

1475
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:22,720
My OBS stuff to show it.

1476
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:23,800
ACP themed dinner.

1477
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,560
She still loves her DJ goal.

1478
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,060
Unless you're gently choosing this one.

1479
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,860
You guys loved it when I used this bowl last time.

1480
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:32,380
Want to show you guys that you can remove this meal section if you don't want to use the sofita part.

1481
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,420
For the base, we'll be using this pork and duck dinner.

1482
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:35,780
I would've done a fish base.

1483
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:36,880
Like, that's so much.

1484
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,260
Honestly, if you'd like her raw base to be fish.

1485
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:40,400
The important part of these dinners is that she enjoys her meal.

1486
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,780
So, I'll be sticking to things that she likes.

1487
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:43,280
Next, I have two options for wet food.

1488
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:44,820
First one is this herring and mackerel.

1489
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:47,460
That's the rich person's dog diet.

1490
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:51,080
If you like a piece of water texture, definitely go with the rustic stew.

1491
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:52,620
Right now, I need something a bit thicker.

1492
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:53,560
And you guys will see why.

1493
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:54,900
I'm trying to make this, like, barrier.

1494
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:57,820
I purposely left this section blank because I want to add, like, the ocean.

1495
01:02:58,020 --> 01:02:58,660
Hopefully this works.

1496
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:01,740
And then she puts that goat milk and stuff.

1497
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,680
And then, like, there's...

1498
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:06,960
You know what I do for dad?

1499
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:10,560
I open a can of wet food and I pour half of it.

1500
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:22,360
Yes!

1501
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:24,940
This dog gets stripped!

1502
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,580
Why is the milk blue?

1503
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,020
Because it's goat milk.

1504
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:33,080
This is my first video with this bowl.

1505
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,800
You know that the hardest part for her are these drawers.

1506
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:37,240
So to really motivate her, I'll be putting in some sweet dried mackerel.

1507
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:38,280
This is every dinner, too.

1508
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,540
The last one I'm adding is this air-dried salmon head.

1509
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:46,160
Like, bro, it's a fucking salmon head as an extra crunch!

1510
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:48,060
Here is the final result.

1511
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,140
Look at this up close.

1512
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:50,560
Aries is still ready for her meal.

1513
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:51,920
She's already standing right beside me.

1514
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:54,320
It has to go through inspection, but I think this one is a no-brainer.

1515
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:55,440
I hope you guys enjoyed.

1516
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,080
Here's your video.

1517
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:57,860
Why is goat milk blue?

1518
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,020
Like, I was like, holy shit!

1519
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:03,560
Look at him!

1520
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:04,340
He just eats it!

1521
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:04,660
Oh!

1522
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:05,920
Everything, too!

1523
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:09,740
And then, like, she gives her...

1524
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:13,860
I was, like, watching some of her videos, too, because I was, like, super cute.

1525
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:15,200
I was like, do you do this every day?

1526
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:15,900
Like...

1527
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:19,840
I was like, do you do this every fucking day?

1528
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:24,220
And then, like, in one of the videos, she was like, oh, yeah.

1529
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:30,300
Um, sometimes I give her, like, cow ear as a treat, because she loves it.

1530
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:34,040
And I was like, you can give dogs cow ears?

1531
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,500
Like, I was like, what?

1532
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:38,520
That's...

1533
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,100
Dogs eat that?

1534
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:42,900
Like...

1535
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:43,740
Yeah!

1536
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,120
I was like, holy fuck!

1537
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:47,420
What?!

1538
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:54,000
Like, there's, like, special dog treats where the dog's snack is literally a fucking cow's ear.

1539
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,100
Um, and then, like, Dad, just, like, like, open a half...

1540
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:02,960
I'm open a can of wet dog food, beef and vegetable stew.

1541
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:06,640
I pour half of it, and then I'm like, here you go!

1542
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,440
And you know what his treat is?

1543
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:11,680
Those little green dental treats for his teeth.

1544
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:17,020
I'll be like, use your green dental treat, and that's good enough for him.

1545
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:18,060
That's...

1546
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:19,580
He's happy with that.

1547
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:20,160
Yeah.

1548
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,740
Yeah, the greenies.

1549
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:24,060
Yeah.

1550
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:26,460
Poor...

1551
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:27,540
What do you mean?

1552
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:28,820
Poor Dad!

1553
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:31,960
He doesn't know any better!

1554
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:33,100
Bro, I'm...

1555
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:33,740
I just...

1556
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:35,940
I didn't know, like, big dogs.

1557
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:36,860
Like...

1558
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:37,300
Like...

1559
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:41,760
I didn't realize big dogs have to eat so much.

1560
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:42,180
I...

1561
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:44,660
It just, like, blew my mind when I was, like, watching that video.

1562
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:47,040
I was like, oh my god, that's a whole nother...

1563
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:48,480
He cannot watch this video.

1564
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:50,300
He must not know the secrets.

1565
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:51,580
He...

1566
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:56,300
It's like, he doesn't have to know that his life could be better.

1567
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:57,440
He doesn't...

1568
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:03,820
Millie, welcome to the tomato farm.

1569
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:04,600
Welcome.

1570
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:05,360
Welcome.

1571
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:08,300
Poor dog thinks he...

1572
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:09,740
He doesn't have to know.

1573
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:15,140
He doesn't have to know about the greener pastures in life.

1574
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,120
Keep him ignorant.

1575
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:16,660
Yes.

1576
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:19,700
That's why he's in the prison.

1577
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:25,240
Um...

1578
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:26,480
Uh...

1579
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,580
Marco, thank you for the...

1580
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:30,580
Super chat, thank you, thank you.

1581
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:34,020
If you were to go on a grand bank heist, who would you bring to help?

1582
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:36,500
And who would you be the getaway driver?

1583
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:39,040
I was going to the bank heist.

1584
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:42,600
Like...

1585
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,580
Why do that when I just...

1586
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:48,580
Why make that hard for myself when I could just...

1587
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,240
When I could...

1588
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,580
When I could just...

1589
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:52,740
When I could just...

1590
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:54,440
Do a rug pull...

1591
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,020
On crypto...

1592
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:57,200
On crypto...

1593
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,020
I'm just thinking like...

1594
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:02,320
Bro, why would I make that so hard for myself?

1595
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:03,140
I'll just...

1596
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:03,840
Fucking...

1597
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:06,700
I'll just start a cryptocurrency...

1598
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:08,180
Or an NFT...

1599
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:10,540
I'll just say it...

1600
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:13,840
Then like...

1601
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:14,440
Cause like...

1602
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:16,100
Okay, if you do a bank heist...

1603
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:17,060
You're already like...

1604
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:17,400
You know...

1605
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,380
You're already in danger of the law.

1606
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:20,280
You know?

1607
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:22,780
So like...

1608
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:24,040
Don't keep going...

1609
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,640
Dropping soon, boys.

1610
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:27,200
Don't keep going...

1611
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,960
Not a rug pull, by the way.

1612
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:29,840
Like...

1613
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,040
I'm just saying like...

1614
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:31,340
If...

1615
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:32,260
I guess like...

1616
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:34,620
You do the bank heist just for the thrill of it.

1617
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:35,000
Like...

1618
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:35,880
Just for the adrenaline.

1619
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:36,840
Cause like...

1620
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,120
If you're gonna do a bank heist...

1621
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:38,380
You're...

1622
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:39,360
You're gonna have...

1623
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:40,240
You know...

1624
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:41,560
Um...

1625
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:42,420
The...

1626
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:43,620
Like...

1627
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:44,380
Build...

1628
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:44,700
I mean...

1629
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:46,320
I guess I could wear a mask and stuff.

1630
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:47,040
And then like...

1631
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:48,220
Not get caught and everything.

1632
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:49,100
I mean like...

1633
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:50,620
I could just change skin suit.

1634
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:52,240
But then I'm just like...

1635
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,260
Yeah, but then like...

1636
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:53,740
Thing is...

1637
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:54,980
You'll have to have that...

1638
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:55,960
Cause the money is...

1639
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:56,640
So...

1640
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,640
The hardest part about...

1641
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:00,500
Doki, why do you know so much?

1642
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:00,900
Okay, look.

1643
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:02,300
I watched a lot about these...

1644
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:03,160
Like...

1645
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:04,120
Heist movies, okay?

1646
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:04,920
And like...

1647
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:05,860
And also like...

1648
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:06,360
Read about it.

1649
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:06,660
So...

1650
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:08,020
The thing about robbing a bank...

1651
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:09,000
The money is marked.

1652
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:10,140
And there's also like...

1653
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:11,640
Died and stuff on the money.

1654
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:12,300
So...

1655
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:13,360
You can't just like...

1656
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:13,620
You know...

1657
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:16,040
Spend that money at supermarkets...

1658
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:16,900
Or stuff like that.

1659
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:17,640
Because like...

1660
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:17,900
You know...

1661
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:19,160
Spend it at a supermarket...

1662
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,200
Or just buy it...

1663
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,600
Like at a store or anything.

1664
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:22,560
Because they...

1665
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:23,360
They would...

1666
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:25,300
Um...

1667
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:27,560
Put the money...

1668
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:28,460
They would monitor...

1669
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,120
Where the money is going.

1670
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:31,360
So...

1671
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:32,600
To do that...

1672
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:33,320
You have to like...

1673
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:34,440
Uh...

1674
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:35,500
Make sure...

1675
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:36,460
That you can...

1676
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:37,440
You're connected with someone...

1677
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:39,380
Who can move the money...

1678
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:40,860
Uh...

1679
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:41,740
And...

1680
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:42,220
Uh...

1681
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:43,860
Yeah, they'll just trace the serial number.

1682
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:44,860
So you have to...

1683
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:45,300
Go underground...

1684
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:46,580
Within like...

1685
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:46,800
You know...

1686
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:47,820
The black market...

1687
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:48,740
To be able to...

1688
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:50,040
Move the money...

1689
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:50,780
Safely...

1690
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:51,520
Underground...

1691
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,920
Where they can't trace it.

1692
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:54,040
And it's not like...

1693
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:55,000
Fully marked...

1694
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:55,900
You have to launder it...

1695
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:56,260
And everything.

1696
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:58,100
And that's a whole different thing.

1697
01:08:58,340 --> 01:08:58,560
Like...

1698
01:08:58,560 --> 01:08:59,440
Money laundering...

1699
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:00,320
Is already like...

1700
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:01,120
So much work...

1701
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:01,700
In general...

1702
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:02,120
As well.

1703
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:02,760
I mean...

1704
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:03,880
You think the hardest part...

1705
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,200
Is doing a bank heist...

1706
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,220
But the hardest part...

1707
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:08,100
Is trying to launder the money...

1708
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,200
To make sure...

1709
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,940
It doesn't connect it back...

1710
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:11,360
To you.

1711
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:12,660
Um...

1712
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:13,180
Because you...

1713
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:14,000
And like...

1714
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:14,720
With that...

1715
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,680
The safest way to launder money...

1716
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:18,100
Is to open like...

1717
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:19,020
A business...

1718
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:19,500
And stuff...

1719
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:20,280
To launder it...

1720
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:20,700
But like...

1721
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:22,160
Then you have to go into...

1722
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,120
Doing...

1723
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,060
Um...

1724
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:24,860
Then you have to...

1725
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:25,860
Go like...

1726
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:26,940
Um...

1727
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:27,580
Um...

1728
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:28,200
And like...

1729
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:28,420
You know...

1730
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:28,740
Look...

1731
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:29,540
Scout out for...

1732
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:30,800
Small businesses...

1733
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:31,800
That you can buy...

1734
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:32,740
So you can start...

1735
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:33,820
Laundering it...

1736
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:34,560
And even...

1737
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:35,680
And that's where...

1738
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:36,820
Tim Hortons comes along...

1739
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:37,640
That...

1740
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:42,200
And that's where...

1741
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,040
Tim Hortons come along...

1742
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,740
Where I would start...

1743
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:47,480
You open my own...

1744
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:48,100
Tim Hortons...

1745
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:49,940
So I can launder the money...

1746
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:50,820
For my...

1747
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:51,840
Bank heist...

1748
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:52,380
Uh...

1749
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:57,560
But anyway...

1750
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:58,280
But like...

1751
01:09:58,280 --> 01:09:59,740
Why do all of that...

1752
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:01,960
When I can just start...

1753
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:02,560
A cryptocurrency...

1754
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:04,280
And just...

1755
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:04,760
Rug pull...

1756
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:08,440
Or even...

1757
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:09,560
Just an NFT...

1758
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:10,940
Because...

1759
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:13,060
Starting a cryptocurrency...

1760
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:14,020
I just...

1761
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:14,940
I can just...

1762
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:15,460
I just...

1763
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:16,780
I just be like...

1764
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:17,380
Hey guys...

1765
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:18,560
Invest in this cryptocurrency...

1766
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:19,460
Like...

1767
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:20,280
I swear to god...

1768
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:21,820
It's not a rug pull...

1769
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:22,860
And then...

1770
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:24,040
And then to...

1771
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:27,460
To pretend that everything is okay...

1772
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:29,820
I can get my family and friends...

1773
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:30,960
Um...

1774
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:31,480
To like...

1775
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:33,260
Invest in the cryptocurrency...

1776
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:34,180
Beforehand...

1777
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:35,340
So it looks like...

1778
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:36,460
There's a lot of money...

1779
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:37,420
Um...

1780
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:37,920
To get...

1781
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:38,240
Like...

1782
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:38,960
It's going...

1783
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:40,600
It's a good cryptocurrency and stuff...

1784
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:41,820
So it looks like...

1785
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:42,420
Um...

1786
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:43,400
It looks like...

1787
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:43,840
Um...

1788
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,320
There's high value in it...

1789
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:45,640
Because...

1790
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:46,080
The...

1791
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,260
The value of it...

1792
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:47,540
Like...

1793
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:48,500
It started off low...

1794
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:49,140
And then I'll be like...

1795
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:49,780
I'll be like...

1796
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:50,480
To my family and friends...

1797
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:50,740
Like...

1798
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:50,980
Okay...

1799
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:51,900
Start buying the coins...

1800
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:52,480
Right now...

1801
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:52,880
And then...

1802
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,100
It shots up...

1803
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:55,660
And then we all just sell it...

1804
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:56,800
And we all just sell it...

1805
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,180
And then we all have money...

1806
01:10:58,180 --> 01:10:59,520
And that's like...

1807
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:00,260
And then like...

1808
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:01,840
If we look at Logan Paul...

1809
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:11,720
Clearly...

1810
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:13,280
There's no consequences...

1811
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:15,260
For their actions...

1812
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:16,220
So...

1813
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:23,060
Umm...

1814
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:23,720
Sorry...

1815
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:24,840
Allegedly...

1816
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:25,740
Allegedly...

1817
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:26,640
If you look at...

1818
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:27,460
Logan Paul...

1819
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:29,160
It seems to be working...

1820
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,020
Also that...

1821
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:31,040
Hawktuo Girl too...

1822
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:31,760
Who started a...

1823
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:32,760
Fucking cryptocurrency.

1824
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,320
And then, like...

1825
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:37,380
And that, like... I don't even know.

1826
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,380
Like, basically destroyed the career that she was...

1827
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:41,700
She managed to build.

1828
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,480
Off of Hot Toa.

1829
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:45,800
Like, surprisingly...

1830
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:48,540
Cryptocurrency is what destroyed her career.

1831
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:50,980
Which is already saying something.

1832
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:53,020
That she could build a career.

1833
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:55,680
Off of the Hot Toa thing.

1834
01:11:59,260 --> 01:11:59,940
But...

1835
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:00,920
Um...

1836
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,140
At least she made...

1837
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:04,320
Like, I'm pretty sure she made so much money.

1838
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:05,460
From just her...

1839
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:06,940
The cryptocurrency alone.

1840
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:09,150
That she didn't have to, like...

1841
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:11,560
Like, she doesn't care at that point.

1842
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:14,220
Because she knew that meme was gonna die.

1843
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:15,480
Like, very...

1844
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:17,200
Like, it was gonna die, like...

1845
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:17,780
Eventually.

1846
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:18,820
Or very soon.

1847
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:19,820
So, like...

1848
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:22,100
I felt like the cryptocurrency thing was, like...

1849
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:22,900
Her last thing.

1850
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:24,360
Like, her last cash out.

1851
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:25,340
Before...

1852
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:27,200
Before, um...

1853
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,040
Before, like...

1854
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:29,120
The meme fully dies.

1855
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:32,560
Um...

1856
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:34,660
Uh...

1857
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:37,340
Though she has lost a lot of money.

1858
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:38,540
How did...

1859
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:40,200
How did she lose a lot of money?

1860
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:42,360
She had so many brand deals.

1861
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:43,340
Like...

1862
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:43,880
She...

1863
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:45,300
Yeah, she sold her...

1864
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:45,860
Damn, I was gonna say!

1865
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:47,720
She even sold her...

1866
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:49,120
She sold her Twitter?

1867
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:50,400
That's crazy.

1868
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:51,840
That's when you're like...

1869
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,020
Like, she knew it was over.

1870
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:54,080
Like...

1871
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,680
She knew it was fucking over.

1872
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:57,000
Anyway...

1873
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:57,820
Um...

1874
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:00,640
But also, that reminded me of...

1875
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:01,580
That kid...

1876
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:03,520
Okay, I don't know if you guys heard of the story.

1877
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:04,540
But...

1878
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:05,880
There was this...

1879
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:06,700
Kid...

1880
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:07,380
That...

1881
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:08,240
Um...

1882
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:08,960
That would...

1883
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,720
Would always do, like, rug pull...

1884
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:11,420
Cryptocurrencies.

1885
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:12,920
And then, like...

1886
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:14,640
And then people kept falling for it.

1887
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:15,140
Like...

1888
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:15,860
Every time.

1889
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:16,660
Like...

1890
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:16,820
Like...

1891
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:18,920
He even named the currency, like...

1892
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:19,540
Rug pull...

1893
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:19,760
Like...

1894
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:21,580
He even named the currency, like...

1895
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:22,800
Rug pull or some shit.

1896
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:24,520
And...

1897
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:24,980
Um...

1898
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:26,980
Yeah, he was like some 14 year old kid.

1899
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,800
14 to 15 year old kid.

1900
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:32,880
And he ran three...

1901
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:33,980
Back to back...

1902
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:35,140
Rug pull...

1903
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:35,920
Cryptocurrencies.

1904
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:37,260
And...

1905
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:40,840
And...

1906
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:41,140
And like...

1907
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:42,120
And then like...

1908
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:42,900
The same people...

1909
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:45,080
Kept investing on it.

1910
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:45,320
Yeah.

1911
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:46,320
And like...

1912
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:48,300
He's like...

1913
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:48,620
I...

1914
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:49,880
They just kept doing it.

1915
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:50,660
Like...

1916
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,020
Good for him.

1917
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:54,880
They'll never see it coming.

1918
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,020
And apparently they didn't!

1919
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:56,720
They...

1920
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:57,760
Apparently they didn't.

1921
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,080
But yeah, like I was saying...

1922
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:00,560
Um...

1923
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:01,080
Yeah.

1924
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:01,560
It's like...

1925
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:03,980
Is it really the kids fault if they kept falling for it?

1926
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:04,520
Like...

1927
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:05,560
Fell for it again.

1928
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:06,440
Over...

1929
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:06,780
Award.

1930
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:08,420
Um...

1931
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:10,360
Um...

1932
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:12,440
Um...

1933
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:13,980
But like I was saying...

1934
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:14,260
Like...

1935
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:17,300
Why would I...

1936
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:19,340
Why would I rob a bank...

1937
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:20,240
When I can...

1938
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:22,100
And I feel like people don't rob banks anymore.

1939
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:22,760
Like...

1940
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:23,760
It's just like...

1941
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:26,420
People just don't rob banks anymore.

1942
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:28,280
It's just not worth it in the end.

1943
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:28,840
The...

1944
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:30,200
The amount of...

1945
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:33,020
Effort and planning you have to do...

1946
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:34,720
To rob a bank...

1947
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:35,320
For the...

1948
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,740
Payout for it...

1949
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:37,840
It's just like...

1950
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:38,780
It's a lost...

1951
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:40,020
It is a lost art form.

1952
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:42,020
Yeah, it's hard to do it now too.

1953
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:43,060
Like the work for it.

1954
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:43,880
Like why do that?

1955
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:43,980
That...

1956
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,540
Why do that illegally?

1957
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:47,180
When you can legally...

1958
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:47,340
Uh...

1959
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:48,680
Pull off scams online.

1960
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:52,160
Like...

1961
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:54,940
Because like...

1962
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:55,660
Like...

1963
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:57,320
There's no laws for...

1964
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:57,680
Crypto...

1965
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:00,100
There's no laws for cryptocurrency...

1966
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:01,300
Batman...

1967
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:02,580
Yet...

1968
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:03,720
There's no...

1969
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:04,880
There's no...

1970
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,080
Because that's the whole point...

1971
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:06,880
Of cryptocurrency...

1972
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:09,140
That it's not regulated...

1973
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:09,840
By...

1974
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:10,900
The banks...

1975
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:11,880
Or the government...

1976
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:12,840
So...

1977
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:15,140
There's no laws for cryptocurrency...

1978
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:15,880
Batman...

1979
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:21,700
So...

1980
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:22,160
It's...

1981
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:22,600
It's...

1982
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:22,660
It's...

1983
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:22,820
It's...

1984
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:22,940
It's...

1985
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:23,220
It's...

1986
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:23,860
No joker...

1987
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:24,980
That's a rug full joker...

1988
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:25,640
Stop!

1989
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:29,280
Um...

1990
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:29,880
Um...

1991
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:30,300
Um...

1992
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:30,560
Um...

1993
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:31,380
There's like...

1994
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:31,740
Like...

1995
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:32,700
There are laws...

1996
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:33,680
But you know what I mean?

1997
01:15:33,740 --> 01:15:34,880
It's like...

1998
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:39,000
The government doesn't really know...

1999
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,200
What to do...

2000
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:41,920
With cryptocurrency...

2001
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:43,800
Because it's such a...

2002
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:44,560
It's like...

2003
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:45,120
You know...

2004
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:45,480
It's...

2005
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:47,240
It's not regulated at all...

2006
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:48,260
Um...

2007
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:50,100
It's not regulated at all...

2008
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:50,840
By...

2009
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:52,280
Uh...

2010
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:53,280
Um...

2011
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,240
By like...

2012
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:55,160
Like any like...

2013
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:56,260
Actual formal structure...

2014
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:57,540
And...

2015
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:58,380
Um...

2016
01:15:58,900 --> 01:15:59,180
And...

2017
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:00,260
Because of that...

2018
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:01,520
It's like...

2019
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:02,300
Easier...

2020
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:03,220
To like...

2021
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:05,380
Legally scam people...

2022
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:08,940
So like...

2023
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:10,520
All I'm saying is...

2024
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:12,240
We're smarter...

2025
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:13,320
Not harder...

2026
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:15,980
I mean...

2027
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:16,340
But...

2028
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:17,940
It is sad that...

2029
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:18,400
You know...

2030
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:19,560
We don't get to have...

2031
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:21,260
Getaway drivers anymore...

2032
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:22,600
Um...

2033
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:23,420
There's no...

2034
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:24,260
There's no...

2035
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:25,220
Thrill of...

2036
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:27,220
Robbing people...

2037
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:28,520
Anymore...

2038
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,980
Ha ha ha ha ha...

2039
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:31,500
I...

2040
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:32,440
I know...

2041
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:33,720
We lost the thrill...

2042
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:35,040
Of robbing people...

2043
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:35,540
I know...

2044
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:36,380
Isn't that sad?

2045
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:37,480
We don't...

2046
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:38,580
Ha ha ha ha...

2047
01:16:39,020 --> 01:16:39,460
Ha ha ha ha...

2048
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:42,580
My...

2049
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:44,520
Dubinetiver told me...

2050
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:45,280
The blockchain...

2051
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:48,220
Took the big robbers job...

2052
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:49,280
No...

2053
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:50,160
More...

2054
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:51,220
Baby driver...

2055
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:53,480
Ha ha ha...

2056
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:54,540
Ha ha ha...

2057
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:58,860
Scamming people online just don't do it for me.

2058
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:03,180
Back in my day, we scammed people in real life.

2059
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:14,280
I can't... AI has truly hurt the economy, guys.

2060
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:17,480
AI has ruined everything, guys.

2061
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:19,320
We can't even, like...

2062
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:25,340
We can't even wear funny masks and rob people at gunpoint anymore.

2063
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:31,280
Crypto Bro has killed the bank robber.

2064
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:34,060
We truly live in the scam society.

2065
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:37,960
Um... She's not... Guys, I'm not promoting.

2066
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:42,460
All I'm saying, like, unless it's Bitcoin, I don't believe...

2067
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:45,900
I personally don't really... I don't know.

2068
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:48,320
It's, like, it's hard to tell.

2069
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:52,540
Because I know there's, like, people that actually made, like, millions...

2070
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:53,960
Like, I don't know no people.

2071
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:56,400
You know, oh my gosh, I know this guy who does, like...

2072
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:56,860
No, I don't.

2073
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:59,560
I actually... I don't know any people, like, personally.

2074
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:01,340
But I've seen people...

2075
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:04,900
Um... I've seen people, like...

2076
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:09,180
Um... become, like, millionaires just from, like, investing in cryptocurrency.

2077
01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:14,160
But also losing a lot of money investing in cryptocurrency.

2078
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:18,500
So it's, like, it's just, like, the stock market, essentially.

2079
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:20,520
It's, like, a huge fucking gamble.

2080
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:22,760
Um...

2081
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:25,340
It's an incredible... Like, like, everything.

2082
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:28,320
Like, it's just a huge gamble investing in things.

2083
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:29,620
Yeah, it's just gambling.

2084
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:30,280
It's...

2085
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:36,240
It's basically gambling because you don't really know, like, what's gonna go well and what...

2086
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:37,600
Um...

2087
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,800
What's gonna, like, you know, not do so well.

2088
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:41,220
Um...

2089
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:42,080
It's just, yeah.

2090
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:43,440
And...

2091
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:44,440
But, you know what's...

2092
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:45,720
What's not a scam?

2093
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:47,760
The Doki coin that I'm gonna drop...

2094
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:52,520
That is not...

2095
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:53,340
That's...

2096
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:56,000
100% not a rug pull.

2097
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:57,240
Uh...

2098
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,060
The odds are...

2099
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:02,040
Are, like, actually, like, 90...

2100
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:03,160
90 to 10.

2101
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:05,020
In terms of 10, not of it.

2102
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:09,860
10% being a rug pull and 90% of it not being a rug pull.

2103
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:10,640
Uh...

2104
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:12,160
So to the moon we go.

2105
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:15,120
A genuine collector's item.

2106
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:17,240
Chat.

2107
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:18,360
I've got it.

2108
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:23,000
And, by the way, guys, I'm planning on opening a Tim Hortons soon, too.

2109
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:23,980
Uh...

2110
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,400
Is that the one...

2111
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:30,640
Yeah, at 1 million subscribers, I will...

2112
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:33,580
I will make Doki coin a reality, chat.

2113
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:35,000
Um...

2114
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,380
Quell, thank you for the super chat.

2115
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:36,800
Thank you.

2116
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:37,520
Thank you.

2117
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:42,780
If there's something with Doki bread on it, there will be a Dragoon who will buy it.

2118
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:44,720
Thank you for the super chat.

2119
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,400
Thank you, thank you.

2120
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:52,580
Please don't, please don't open DokiCoin.

2121
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:59,540
Yeah, that's the, that's the 1 million subscribers, um, announcement.

2122
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:03,340
Out of a million subscribers, DokiCoin will be real.

2123
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:09,100
Um, investing all my money in DokiCoin right now!

2124
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:12,460
Yeah, I mean, it is interesting.

2125
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:17,140
It is interesting, like, I feel like NFTs are dead-dead for real.

2126
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:19,220
That NFT was such a fucking fad.

2127
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:24,100
Like, they're like, oh my god, it's like a PNG that only you can own.

2128
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:26,820
Please don't copy it.

2129
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:32,920
I remember like, I remember when people were like, stop saving my, my NFT!

2130
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:35,420
It's, it's mine!

2131
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:37,680
Oh, and then what's his name?

2132
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:43,420
Um, the guy who voices, the guy who does Robot Chicken.

2133
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:47,180
Um, oh my god, what the fuck was his name?

2134
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:48,780
The guy that does Robot Chicken.

2135
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:50,040
Seth, what's his name?

2136
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:50,300
No.

2137
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:53,160
It was a Seth, uh...

2138
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:56,040
Control C, right click, save.

2139
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:57,320
Seth Green!

2140
01:20:57,320 --> 01:21:02,160
I remember I talked about it before when Seth Green started his own NFT show.

2141
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:11,800
But like, he couldn't, he couldn't broadcast it at all because his NFT got held hostage by some, like, by some NFT bro.

2142
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:15,840
And, yeah, Seth Green was like, a heavy investor.

2143
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:17,900
And, um...

2144
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:20,260
And, what's it called?

2145
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:21,560
The Ape one?

2146
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:23,260
Oh my gosh, I already forgot.

2147
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:27,680
I feel like, a year on the internet is literally 20 years.

2148
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:29,760
I already forgot, like, what...

2149
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:30,600
Oh, his Bored Ape.

2150
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:32,340
Yeah, oh my god, the Bored Ape thing.

2151
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:38,200
By the way, guys, I don't know if you guys know this, but Bored Ape was started in...

2152
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:39,640
Four years ago.

2153
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:40,100
In...

2154
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:44,300
In four years, Bored Ape has already fell off.

2155
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:45,620
Like...

2156
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:47,620
TikTok.

2157
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:49,840
I'm surprised I'm still here.

2158
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,160
I'm surprised I'm still here, guys.

2159
01:21:57,380 --> 01:22:02,580
But in four years, Bored Ape has already been, like, forgotten.

2160
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:05,220
Like, I also, like, forgot, like, what they were called.

2161
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:06,240
Um...

2162
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:06,560
But...

2163
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:14,340
Seth Green was gonna start a comedy show based off of, like, all the NFTs that...

2164
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:16,060
Yeah, I outlived the apes.

2165
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:16,680
Isn't that crazy?

2166
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:18,680
I actually outlived the Bored Ape era.

2167
01:22:19,420 --> 01:22:20,140
But...

2168
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:21,400
Um...

2169
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:25,280
But Seth Green, um...

2170
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:25,840
Was...

2171
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:30,140
Had a pilot show that's based off of his NFTs.

2172
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:34,560
But he couldn't release it because his account got hacked.

2173
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:41,100
And then, like, one of the Bored Apes that was supposed to be, like, part of his show...

2174
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:42,640
Um...

2175
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:45,140
Got sold off to another NFT collector.

2176
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:49,360
And then that collector was holding the Ape hostage.

2177
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:54,880
And was like, you have to transfer this X amount of money if you want your Ape back.

2178
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:55,580
And...

2179
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:57,120
So...

2180
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:58,080
So...

2181
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:58,360
Yeah.

2182
01:22:58,880 --> 01:22:59,480
So, like...

2183
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:06,820
Seth Green couldn't get his Bored Ape show, like, greenlit because of his fucking NFT getting held hostage.

2184
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:07,820
Which was just...

2185
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:09,380
Which was, like, crazy.

2186
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:12,220
And then I think by the time he got his show...

2187
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:14,100
Like, his NFT back...

2188
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:14,940
Um...

2189
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:16,180
The show got, like...

2190
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:16,380
They...

2191
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:17,800
They canceled the show.

2192
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:22,100
The guy did...

2193
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:24,820
Did Seth a favor.

2194
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:27,060
Couldn't he just make...

2195
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:27,580
Yeah, but...

2196
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:28,340
You don't understand.

2197
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:30,020
It was his NFT.

2198
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:34,060
It was, like, his main character in the show.

2199
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:37,160
Um...

2200
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:37,960
Um...

2201
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:40,700
Oh, and I remember there was that time...

2202
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:42,280
When the...

2203
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:45,640
The Bored Ape or Yacht Club or whatever...

2204
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:50,720
They did, like, a convention or, like, a party for...

2205
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:55,660
They did, like, a convention or party for, like, every member...

2206
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:58,880
Like, for members who had a Bored Ape.

2207
01:23:59,060 --> 01:24:00,880
And then, like, at the...

2208
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:02,680
At the party...

2209
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:04,400
Uh...

2210
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:04,720
Oh, yeah.

2211
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:05,460
Ape Fest.

2212
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:07,060
For those who don't know...

2213
01:24:07,060 --> 01:24:08,620
There was the infamous laser...

2214
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,520
Laser incident...

2215
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:12,180
Where...

2216
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:13,480
They got UV lights...

2217
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:15,540
But their UV lights...

2218
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:16,480
Were...

2219
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:19,340
Um...

2220
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:19,440
Um...

2221
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:20,480
Were, like, used...

2222
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:22,640
To, like...

2223
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:23,700
Kill...

2224
01:24:24,380 --> 01:24:25,400
Parasites or something?

2225
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:35,760
They basically got very unsafe UV lights, where it was nearly, like, burning the people there.

2226
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:41,540
Yeah, they got industrial UV lights instead of, like, concert UV lights.

2227
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:44,900
So, like, apparently, there were reports that...

2228
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:54,060
There was one report where one guy was, like, blind for, like, several days because he was staring at the UV lights.

2229
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:01,440
And, like, people had, like, actual, like, burn...

2230
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:03,660
Like, yeah, it was, like, unfiltered UV lights.

2231
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:07,660
And someone had, like, burn marks and stuff on their skins because of it.

2232
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:10,940
And I was like, how do you fuck up that?

2233
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,280
Like, I don't know how that...

2234
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:14,000
Like, I don't know.

2235
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:18,000
When you buy UV lights, I'm just, like...

2236
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:18,740
I'm...

2237
01:25:18,740 --> 01:25:20,580
Did they order it off Amazon?

2238
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:23,820
Like, how did no one warn them?

2239
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:25,420
I was so confused.

2240
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:27,480
I was like, how does that...

2241
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:31,580
How does that get unnoticed?

2242
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:32,480
You know?

2243
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:36,400
Like, how did, like, no one notice that?

2244
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:38,120
Or, like, no one stop them?

2245
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:40,420
Like, was it ordered off Amazon?

2246
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:41,900
Like...

2247
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:48,620
Because I feel like you're buying industrial UV lights.

2248
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:49,920
There's, like...

2249
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:51,040
There's, like...

2250
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:51,880
I don't know.

2251
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:53,840
Even reading that on a...

2252
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:55,380
Like, if you're, like, I need...

2253
01:25:55,380 --> 01:25:57,820
I need UV lights for a concert.

2254
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:58,480
You know?

2255
01:25:58,620 --> 01:25:59,440
For a party.

2256
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:01,460
And then you read the description.

2257
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:04,680
And it says, Industrial UV lights.

2258
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:05,460
And, like...

2259
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:06,000
I don't know.

2260
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:08,900
Maybe their first thought was that...

2261
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:09,320
Wow.

2262
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:11,520
Industrial means, like...

2263
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:13,420
Means that it's stronger.

2264
01:26:13,420 --> 01:26:15,080
So, it'll look cooler.

2265
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:15,660
Like...

2266
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:17,740
I guess that was the...

2267
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:20,080
I guess that was the mindset.

2268
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:22,780
This industrial equals cooler.

2269
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:24,460
Because, um...

2270
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:25,400
It's stronger.

2271
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:27,960
And looks better at night.

2272
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:32,000
Bigger equals better.

2273
01:26:32,180 --> 01:26:33,760
Like, that's how I'm thinking it.

2274
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:34,980
That's how it's, like...

2275
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:37,700
Because I'm like, Why didn't anyone stop?

2276
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:44,600
Because I got...

2277
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:47,180
That's what, like, makes me so confused.

2278
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:48,560
Like, we're doing no...

2279
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:49,840
We're already called...

2280
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:51,740
You know how, like...

2281
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:52,480
Okay.

2282
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:53,220
This is a...

2283
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:53,360
Okay.

2284
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:53,840
I was getting this.

2285
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:54,160
Okay.

2286
01:26:54,220 --> 01:26:55,280
You know how, like...

2287
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:56,100
You know...

2288
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:56,900
Um...

2289
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:57,700
Fail-safes?

2290
01:26:58,160 --> 01:26:59,020
Wouldn't there be, like...

2291
01:26:59,020 --> 01:26:59,900
What's that word called?

2292
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,340
Where a person would be there to make sure, like...

2293
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:03,460
Things...

2294
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:04,820
Go according to plan.

2295
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:06,700
And nothing fucks up.

2296
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:08,200
There's, like, a thing for that.

2297
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:09,480
I don't remember what...

2298
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:10,360
Adults?

2299
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,140
Not true.

2300
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:13,800
Uh...

2301
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:15,540
Um...

2302
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:18,840
Um...

2303
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:19,860
Safeguards.

2304
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:22,540
Safeguards.

2305
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:23,960
Regulations.

2306
01:27:24,260 --> 01:27:27,120
Like, someone to make sure something doesn't fuck up.

2307
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:27,520
You know?

2308
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:32,320
Oh shit.

2309
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:32,640
No.

2310
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:33,920
I guess, like...

2311
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:34,360
Fels...

2312
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:34,960
Like...

2313
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:35,580
Like...

2314
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:36,360
I guess, like...

2315
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:37,320
I don't know.

2316
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,240
I guess, like, quality control.

2317
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:43,100
Like, someone there to, like, make sure, like...

2318
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,280
Things don't fuck up.

2319
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:46,420
So I'm just, like...

2320
01:27:46,420 --> 01:27:46,800
How...

2321
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,060
I guess they paid people off, too.

2322
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:50,380
Because I know, like...

2323
01:27:50,380 --> 01:27:51,720
Some people do that.

2324
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:53,180
Where they're, like...

2325
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:54,160
Um...

2326
01:27:54,160 --> 01:27:55,000
They're, like...

2327
01:27:55,780 --> 01:27:56,220
Oh...

2328
01:27:56,220 --> 01:27:58,780
There seems to be something wrong here.

2329
01:27:58,940 --> 01:27:59,700
And they'll be, like...

2330
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:00,380
No, there isn't.

2331
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:01,060
Here's 500...

2332
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:01,920
Here's a board ape.

2333
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:02,380
Like...

2334
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:07,480
No, there isn't anything wrong.

2335
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,640
Here's a board ape for your time, sir.

2336
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:10,640
And they're, like...

2337
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:10,920
Okay.

2338
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:11,540
Okay.

2339
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:19,720
So...

2340
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:20,400
Um...

2341
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,680
That's how I'm, like, thinking.

2342
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:22,160
Because I'm, like...

2343
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:23,220
How did that...

2344
01:28:23,220 --> 01:28:23,580
By...

2345
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:24,860
Bypass everything?

2346
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:25,740
How did they...

2347
01:28:25,740 --> 01:28:29,780
How did industrial UV lights manage to fucking get there?

2348
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:32,820
But...

2349
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:33,640
No, I think...

2350
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:34,780
I think it's crazy.

2351
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:36,020
But I'm glad, like...

2352
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:37,460
NFTs have, like...

2353
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:37,900
Died out.

2354
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:38,440
I think...

2355
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:40,620
That reminded me of that...

2356
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:41,580
What was it?

2357
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:43,240
The FNAF clone?

2358
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:46,100
It was that FNAF clone where...

2359
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:46,320
Oh, yeah.

2360
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:48,140
Before I go on to the NFT...

2361
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:51,060
I love how the reason why we'll never get a...

2362
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:52,140
Actual, like...

2363
01:28:52,140 --> 01:28:53,560
FNAF franchise...

2364
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:55,340
Is because...

2365
01:28:55,340 --> 01:28:56,240
Um...

2366
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:59,520
Scott is so scared that someone is gonna...

2367
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:00,620
Copycat...

2368
01:29:00,620 --> 01:29:02,620
The Bite of 75...

2369
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:05,660
In real life.

2370
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:09,380
So that's why we will never get an IRL, like...

2371
01:29:09,380 --> 01:29:10,820
Five Nights at Freddy's franchise.

2372
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:13,040
Or, like, just, like, a pizzeria...

2373
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:14,840
Type thing for, like...

2374
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:15,100
Um...

2375
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:15,600
Tourists.

2376
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:16,720
Or, like...

2377
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:17,580
For, like, a...

2378
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:19,380
You know, like, a touristy gimmick place.

2379
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:21,140
Um...

2380
01:29:21,140 --> 01:29:21,580
But...

2381
01:29:21,580 --> 01:29:22,800
Scott was actually...

2382
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,060
Is actually, like...

2383
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:26,140
Super scared that someone's gonna recreate...

2384
01:29:26,140 --> 01:29:27,500
The Bite of 69...

2385
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:28,280
In real life.

2386
01:29:28,460 --> 01:29:29,120
Because of it.

2387
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:30,440
Um...

2388
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:33,640
Yeah.

2389
01:29:33,820 --> 01:29:35,480
That's why we'll never get a pizzeria.

2390
01:29:38,780 --> 01:29:39,340
Um...

2391
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:40,820
Fake Markiplier fan...

2392
01:29:40,820 --> 01:29:42,400
Doesn't even know the bite quote.

2393
01:29:42,580 --> 01:29:44,160
I know the bite quote.

2394
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:45,540
It's the Bite of 45.

2395
01:29:51,740 --> 01:29:52,300
Um...

2396
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:52,860
Anyway.

2397
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:55,320
Um...

2398
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:57,520
As I was saying...

2399
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:58,520
Uh...

2400
01:29:58,520 --> 01:29:59,620
There was that...

2401
01:29:59,620 --> 01:30:01,200
I don't remember if people remember it...

2402
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:02,580
But there was this, like...

2403
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:03,840
There was this, like...

2404
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,120
Five Nights at Freddy's clone...

2405
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:06,540
Where it's based off of, like...

2406
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:07,220
Um...

2407
01:30:07,220 --> 01:30:08,260
A candy store.

2408
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:09,880
And...

2409
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:10,960
Um...

2410
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:13,080
It was based off a candy store.

2411
01:30:13,180 --> 01:30:15,040
And everybody was super fucking hyped.

2412
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:15,980
Because...

2413
01:30:15,980 --> 01:30:17,000
They're like...

2414
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:17,520
Oh my god!

2415
01:30:17,540 --> 01:30:18,480
That looks so good!

2416
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:20,660
The graphics and the concepts...

2417
01:30:20,660 --> 01:30:21,500
And the...

2418
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:22,500
Um...

2419
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:23,080
And the trailer.

2420
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:24,200
And then in the end...

2421
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:25,100
It was just an NFT.

2422
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:27,500
He had the Candy Land NFT!

2423
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:28,020
Yeah!

2424
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:28,720
And then they're like...

2425
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:29,360
Don't worry guys!

2426
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:30,780
We're actually gonna make a game!

2427
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,520
And then later on...

2428
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:33,540
They're like...

2429
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:33,860
Sorry!

2430
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:35,500
I meant we're gonna have an animation!

2431
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:36,820
And apparently the animation...

2432
01:30:39,860 --> 01:30:40,660
Is like...

2433
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:42,040
Is it like...

2434
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:43,280
Half AI or something?

2435
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:44,220
I don't remember.

2436
01:30:44,420 --> 01:30:45,760
I watched a little bit of it.

2437
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:46,700
Because I got curious.

2438
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:47,200
I was like...

2439
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:48,340
What the fuck is going on?

2440
01:30:48,340 --> 01:30:51,480
It looks so bad.

2441
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:53,780
It actually had promise too.

2442
01:30:53,980 --> 01:30:55,020
Which was funny.

2443
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:56,460
It actually looked like...

2444
01:30:56,910 --> 01:30:58,260
It could be good.

2445
01:30:58,920 --> 01:30:59,500
But...

2446
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:00,240
Um...

2447
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:01,520
But obviously like...

2448
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:02,040
It was...

2449
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:02,780
Yeah, it was...

2450
01:31:02,780 --> 01:31:03,560
It was like...

2451
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:05,260
Half AI generated or something.

2452
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,000
It had so much potential.

2453
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:07,920
And then they're like...

2454
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:08,300
JK!

2455
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:09,580
JK!

2456
01:31:09,580 --> 01:31:11,840
We're just gonna sell NFTs now.

2457
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:13,780
Um...

2458
01:31:13,780 --> 01:31:15,120
Mr. Broken Bond.

2459
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:16,040
Thank you for the super chat.

2460
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:16,820
Thank you, thank you.

2461
01:31:16,820 --> 01:31:19,660
I'll be mad if I got a Bored Ape for a bribe.

2462
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:20,420
Thank you for the super chat.

2463
01:31:20,540 --> 01:31:21,160
Thank you, thank you.

2464
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:22,160
Also...

2465
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:23,560
Speaking of like...

2466
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:26,260
Sorry, this whole thing is about cryptocurrency and...

2467
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:27,180
And NFTs.

2468
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:29,160
But I find it super interesting.

2469
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:31,040
Because it is a...

2470
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:33,460
New concept in society.

2471
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:34,900
So every...

2472
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:36,260
It feels like every month...

2473
01:31:36,260 --> 01:31:38,660
There's something new going on about it.

2474
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:40,260
Because everyone's still trying to figure out...

2475
01:31:40,260 --> 01:31:42,480
How the fuck cryptocurrency and NFTs work.

2476
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:43,700
But like...

2477
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:44,680
Apparently...

2478
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:50,540
There is a...

2479
01:31:50,540 --> 01:31:53,740
There is one person...

2480
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:55,540
Who owns...

2481
01:31:55,540 --> 01:31:58,800
The majority of Bitcoin right now.

2482
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:01,600
But he hasn't touched his account...

2483
01:32:02,460 --> 01:32:04,280
Before like...

2484
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:05,100
How many...

2485
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:07,300
Like 10 plus years or some shit.

2486
01:32:07,780 --> 01:32:08,640
And everyone...

2487
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:10,540
So like...

2488
01:32:10,540 --> 01:32:12,560
Yeah, so basically...

2489
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:13,440
This guy...

2490
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,220
Technically...

2491
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:15,160
If he ever...

2492
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:16,280
Gets access...

2493
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:18,100
To...

2494
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:20,600
Yeah, the wallet that's...

2495
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:21,360
Lost forever.

2496
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:22,640
Uh...

2497
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:25,400
So...

2498
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:27,280
No one knows...

2499
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:29,600
No one knows...

2500
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:31,820
What happened to this man.

2501
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:32,460
Because...

2502
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:33,660
Because...

2503
01:32:33,660 --> 01:32:34,840
His Bitcoin...

2504
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:36,020
Has like...

2505
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:37,700
Not been touched...

2506
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:38,680
Since...

2507
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:39,420
It's founding.

2508
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:40,480
Yeah...

2509
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:41,020
It's like...

2510
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:41,980
The one piece is real.

2511
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:42,840
And like...

2512
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:44,620
He basically...

2513
01:32:44,620 --> 01:32:45,760
Holds...

2514
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:46,460
Majority...

2515
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:48,540
Of like...

2516
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:49,060
The...

2517
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:50,760
The value of Bitcoin.

2518
01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:52,780
So if he...

2519
01:32:52,780 --> 01:32:53,120
Yeah...

2520
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:53,900
Everyone...

2521
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:54,880
People are like...

2522
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:55,120
What...

2523
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:55,960
Don't know...

2524
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:56,880
If it's because...

2525
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:57,640
He lost...

2526
01:32:58,320 --> 01:32:58,880
The...

2527
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:00,420
It's literally the gold mine of Bitcoin.

2528
01:33:00,420 --> 01:33:01,220
But...

2529
01:33:01,220 --> 01:33:02,360
The moment...

2530
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:03,220
Anyone...

2531
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:05,240
Has access...

2532
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:06,740
Um...

2533
01:33:06,740 --> 01:33:08,920
Has access...

2534
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:10,040
To...

2535
01:33:10,040 --> 01:33:10,840
His wallet...

2536
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:11,900
And sell...

2537
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:13,220
All the Bitcoin...

2538
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:15,240
That's in that wallet...

2539
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:16,720
It will crash...

2540
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:17,880
The Bitcoin economy.

2541
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:22,600
The person...

2542
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:23,220
Who sold it...

2543
01:33:23,220 --> 01:33:23,860
Will be rich...

2544
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:24,620
Will be rich...

2545
01:33:24,620 --> 01:33:25,540
For the rest of his life.

2546
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:26,120
Like...

2547
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:28,200
He's made it for his generation...

2548
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:29,640
And the generation...

2549
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:30,320
For like...

2550
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:31,120
Maybe like...

2551
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:32,140
10 generation...

2552
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:32,560
They'll...

2553
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:33,140
They'll be okay.

2554
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:34,600
But like...

2555
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:35,420
Whoever...

2556
01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:37,560
Whoever...

2557
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:38,400
Whoever...

2558
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:39,580
Actually has...

2559
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:40,460
Gets access...

2560
01:33:40,460 --> 01:33:41,860
To that account...

2561
01:33:41,860 --> 01:33:42,980
And sells...

2562
01:33:42,980 --> 01:33:44,880
All of that Bitcoin...

2563
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:46,380
The Bitcoin economy...

2564
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:47,160
Will crash...

2565
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:48,840
Ha ha ha ha...

2566
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:50,100
Ha ha ha...

2567
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:50,420
Ha ha ha...

2568
01:33:50,420 --> 01:33:51,100
Ha ha ha...

2569
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:52,220
Which is...

2570
01:33:52,220 --> 01:33:53,160
So it...

2571
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:53,540
Like...

2572
01:33:53,540 --> 01:33:56,300
I find that incredibly interesting...

2573
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:57,100
Because...

2574
01:33:57,100 --> 01:33:58,780
The biggest rug...

2575
01:33:58,780 --> 01:33:59,200
The biggest rug...

2576
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:00,900
Full of all time...

2577
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:01,500
Um...

2578
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:02,000
So...

2579
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,520
It all lies...

2580
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,520
In...

2581
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:06,320
One man...

2582
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:07,160
Like...

2583
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:09,240
One man's wallet...

2584
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:10,320
Yeah...

2585
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:11,180
Ha ha ha...

2586
01:34:11,180 --> 01:34:12,320
Ha ha ha...

2587
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:27,080
Ha ha ha...

2588
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:28,180
Nobody knows...

2589
01:34:28,180 --> 01:34:28,560
Nobody knows...

2590
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:29,240
Nobody knows...

2591
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:30,740
Ha ha ha...

2592
01:34:30,740 --> 01:34:31,740
Ha ha ha...

2593
01:34:31,740 --> 01:34:32,240
Ha ha ha...

2594
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:32,740
The man...

2595
01:34:32,740 --> 01:34:34,640
This man is the main...

2596
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:35,880
Because the money...

2597
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:37,680
Hasn't been touched...

2598
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:37,980
In...

2599
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:40,940
Since the founding of Bitcoin...

2600
01:34:40,940 --> 01:34:44,100
So, it all relies on this one guy.

2601
01:34:46,460 --> 01:34:46,940
Yeah.

2602
01:34:47,460 --> 01:34:50,040
So, like, some people say he's dead, because no one knows.

2603
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:51,360
No one knows who he really is.

2604
01:34:51,580 --> 01:34:55,500
Like, people say he's either dead, or, like, he forgot his password.

2605
01:34:55,960 --> 01:35:06,240
But this... that wallet is what is the deciding factor of, like, what Bitcoin is worth right now.

2606
01:35:07,540 --> 01:35:10,400
Sounds like the guy who threw away his PC with his Bitcoin account.

2607
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:15,020
Saw Bitcoin go up and desperately searched a bunch of landfills for it.

2608
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:17,660
He is... he is the one.

2609
01:35:17,980 --> 01:35:22,800
And I hear, like, people have been trying to hack in...

2610
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:28,100
Like, I think, like, people have been trying to hack into his Bitcoin wallet, but it's been, like...

2611
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:30,080
Like, nobody can access it.

2612
01:35:30,380 --> 01:35:32,720
Let's see, let me see if I can find his worth right now.

2613
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:34,260
I don't even know how much Bitcoin he has.

2614
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:36,260
It's actually crazy.

2615
01:35:43,830 --> 01:35:44,730
It's like...

2616
01:35:44,730 --> 01:35:44,870
It's like...

2617
01:35:44,870 --> 01:35:45,330
I don't remember.

2618
01:35:45,610 --> 01:35:46,650
It was so much.

2619
01:35:51,730 --> 01:35:52,890
I have, like...

2620
01:35:53,310 --> 01:35:55,650
It has to be, like, fucking millions.

2621
01:35:58,930 --> 01:36:00,350
We're gonna steal a...

2622
01:36:00,350 --> 01:36:01,850
National Treasure 3.

2623
01:36:02,110 --> 01:36:04,650
We're gonna steal the Bitcoin wallet.

2624
01:36:05,430 --> 01:36:07,870
One coin to rule them all.

2625
01:36:08,390 --> 01:36:09,050
After dark.

2626
01:36:09,150 --> 01:36:10,030
Thank you for the super chat.

2627
01:36:10,170 --> 01:36:10,410
Thank you.

2628
01:36:10,550 --> 01:36:11,210
Thank you.

2629
01:36:12,050 --> 01:36:13,710
Doki Doki has the best laugh.

2630
01:36:13,890 --> 01:36:14,670
A bundle of joy.

2631
01:36:14,890 --> 01:36:14,990
Period.

2632
01:36:15,110 --> 01:36:15,870
Thank you for the super chat.

2633
01:36:16,010 --> 01:36:16,210
Thank you.

2634
01:36:16,310 --> 01:36:16,570
Thank you.

2635
01:36:16,570 --> 01:36:18,890
Yeah, that wallet has, like, never been touched to.

2636
01:36:21,050 --> 01:36:21,510
Um...

2637
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:25,390
It was over 300 million.

2638
01:36:25,790 --> 01:36:27,170
Jesus Christ.

2639
01:36:31,710 --> 01:36:32,170
Uh...

2640
01:36:32,170 --> 01:36:34,850
What else I wanted to talk to you guys about?

2641
01:36:35,090 --> 01:36:35,590
Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.

2642
01:36:35,590 --> 01:36:36,730
I wrote some stuff down.

2643
01:36:38,870 --> 01:36:39,330
Um...

2644
01:36:39,330 --> 01:36:42,610
Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.

2645
01:36:42,610 --> 01:36:43,110
Uh...

2646
01:36:43,110 --> 01:36:43,970
Or, like...

2647
01:36:43,970 --> 01:36:45,090
Save some tweets.

2648
01:36:46,850 --> 01:36:48,370
My guy...

2649
01:36:48,370 --> 01:36:51,870
The one Bitcoin to rule them up.

2650
01:36:54,870 --> 01:36:57,210
Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.

2651
01:36:57,210 --> 01:36:57,450
Oh, yeah.

2652
01:36:57,570 --> 01:36:58,150
Funny thing.

2653
01:36:59,910 --> 01:37:00,670
Um...

2654
01:37:00,670 --> 01:37:02,050
Okay, so...

2655
01:37:02,050 --> 01:37:02,770
Um...

2656
01:37:02,770 --> 01:37:06,030
You might notice that I'm starting to tweet a little bit more, too.

2657
01:37:07,370 --> 01:37:07,750
Um...

2658
01:37:08,130 --> 01:37:08,570
Um...

2659
01:37:08,570 --> 01:37:09,910
But, basically, like...

2660
01:37:09,910 --> 01:37:13,030
Uh, for a... almost a year.

2661
01:37:13,370 --> 01:37:15,530
This was out of sheer laziness, by the way.

2662
01:37:15,710 --> 01:37:19,410
There was no other reason I did this other than the fact that I was really fucking lazy.

2663
01:37:19,730 --> 01:37:27,890
But, if you have Twitter Blue, um, you know how Twitter Blue has... or like, Premium, sorry.

2664
01:37:28,050 --> 01:37:32,010
They always change the name that I keep forgetting what they're called these days.

2665
01:37:32,510 --> 01:37:33,570
But, Twitter Premium.

2666
01:37:33,990 --> 01:37:37,810
So you know how there was like this monetization thing that they did?

2667
01:37:37,810 --> 01:37:41,870
Um, so, like, you get paid for your tweets and stuff.

2668
01:37:42,550 --> 01:37:45,730
So, I had... so, um...

2669
01:37:45,730 --> 01:37:49,910
At first, uh, they... I'm not farming interactions, guys.

2670
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:54,030
I'm not trying...

2671
01:37:54,030 --> 01:38:00,050
Oh no, it was just the fact that, um, so, basically, um...

2672
01:38:00,050 --> 01:38:06,110
If I was truly farming interactions, I would... I would tweet stuff like, name a VTuber.

2673
01:38:06,110 --> 01:38:10,290
I bet you can't name a VTuber who's, uh, um...

2674
01:38:10,290 --> 01:38:12,730
Whose letter doesn't start with a vowel, guys.

2675
01:38:12,930 --> 01:38:13,990
That's farming interactions.

2676
01:38:14,110 --> 01:38:16,430
Oh my gosh, the amount of people that fall into that.

2677
01:38:19,910 --> 01:38:24,410
Or be like, ooh, what's your current favorite starter in all the Pokemon...

2678
01:38:24,410 --> 01:38:27,130
In all the Pokemon gens, what's your favorite starter?

2679
01:38:29,350 --> 01:38:29,910
Um...

2680
01:38:29,910 --> 01:38:31,450
Um... Or like, reply with your favorite starter.

2681
01:38:32,130 --> 01:38:33,130
Or, um...

2682
01:38:34,870 --> 01:38:35,990
Uh, anyway...

2683
01:38:35,990 --> 01:38:36,530
Anyway!

2684
01:38:38,590 --> 01:38:39,150
Um...

2685
01:38:39,150 --> 01:38:40,150
So...

2686
01:38:40,150 --> 01:38:41,610
At first, Twitter...

2687
01:38:41,610 --> 01:38:44,270
When it was first, Twitter Blue, you didn't have...

2688
01:38:44,270 --> 01:38:47,610
Uh, you can just buy it, and then you get the monetization thing.

2689
01:38:47,610 --> 01:38:48,950
Uh, by subscribe...

2690
01:38:48,950 --> 01:38:52,450
Like, by just subscribing to Twitter Blue, you automatically get the...

2691
01:38:52,450 --> 01:38:55,850
The monetization of your tweets and getting paid to tweet and stuff.

2692
01:38:56,750 --> 01:38:57,230
So...

2693
01:38:57,230 --> 01:38:57,870
Uh...

2694
01:38:57,870 --> 01:38:58,370
Or like...

2695
01:38:58,370 --> 01:38:59,970
Quote retweet with...

2696
01:38:59,970 --> 01:39:00,750
Okay...

2697
01:39:01,870 --> 01:39:04,870
This might be a little bit of a hot take, but those that...

2698
01:39:04,870 --> 01:39:06,910
Share a piece of lore about yourself...

2699
01:39:06,910 --> 01:39:08,170
They're very interesting.

2700
01:39:08,170 --> 01:39:11,210
The person that fucking first came up with that...

2701
01:39:11,210 --> 01:39:14,090
Was 100% interaction farming.

2702
01:39:14,670 --> 01:39:15,250
Like...

2703
01:39:16,310 --> 01:39:18,530
And all the iterations of that...

2704
01:39:18,530 --> 01:39:21,870
That is like, peak interaction farming right there.

2705
01:39:22,250 --> 01:39:22,670
That...

2706
01:39:22,670 --> 01:39:24,510
But like, it's interesting.

2707
01:39:24,770 --> 01:39:27,530
At least you get something interesting out of that, though.

2708
01:39:27,630 --> 01:39:27,890
You know?

2709
01:39:28,130 --> 01:39:30,890
Like, actual, like, substance to your tweets.

2710
01:39:31,410 --> 01:39:32,050
Um...

2711
01:39:32,050 --> 01:39:32,610
Yeah...

2712
01:39:33,170 --> 01:39:33,490
Anyway...

2713
01:39:34,830 --> 01:39:35,470
Um...

2714
01:39:36,330 --> 01:39:37,530
It's an interaction goldman.

2715
01:39:38,670 --> 01:39:41,110
But, what I'm trying to say is that...

2716
01:39:41,110 --> 01:39:41,890
Uh...

2717
01:39:41,890 --> 01:39:45,490
B-b-b-b-b-ba-b-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-wa What I was trying to say,...

2718
01:39:46,530 --> 01:39:46,930
Um...

2719
01:39:47,470 --> 01:39:48,330
Was that...

2720
01:39:48,330 --> 01:39:50,310
When Twitter Blue first came out...

2721
01:39:50,930 --> 01:39:53,950
You didn't have to verify your fucking IDенти.

2722
01:39:57,010 --> 01:39:57,410
So...

2723
01:39:57,410 --> 01:39:58,150
So...

2724
01:39:58,150 --> 01:40:00,430
If you guys didn't know about Twitter Blue...

2725
01:40:00,430 --> 01:40:01,890
Oh my gosh, I didn't even realize that.

2726
01:40:02,650 --> 01:40:03,050
Uh...

2727
01:40:03,050 --> 01:40:08,630
But for Twitter Blue... Sorry, I was like, for some reason, I was like, I don't know why I was like, all the way over here.

2728
01:40:08,890 --> 01:40:10,530
And I was like, get away from me.

2729
01:40:13,490 --> 01:40:14,290
But, um...

2730
01:40:15,410 --> 01:40:18,970
You don't have to verify your identity or anything, so...

2731
01:40:18,970 --> 01:40:22,650
But when you get Twitter Blue, you actually have to, like...

2732
01:40:22,650 --> 01:40:28,150
send them a picture of your ID and your passport and stuff like that.

2733
01:40:28,290 --> 01:40:31,450
And then, like, link an account, like, link some fucking account.

2734
01:40:31,450 --> 01:40:36,810
So, I didn't do that for an entire year, because I was very lazy.

2735
01:40:37,370 --> 01:40:39,350
And also, like, I don't know, I didn't really...

2736
01:40:39,350 --> 01:40:42,870
At that time, I was like, I don't really want to give them my data.

2737
01:40:43,390 --> 01:40:45,130
Like, I didn't...

2738
01:40:45,130 --> 01:40:46,670
Yeah, I was like, I don't know.

2739
01:40:46,810 --> 01:40:47,610
But then, like...

2740
01:40:47,610 --> 01:40:50,050
But then, um...

2741
01:40:50,050 --> 01:40:51,410
Um, I did that.

2742
01:40:51,570 --> 01:40:52,910
I linked...

2743
01:40:52,910 --> 01:40:54,090
I sent them a picture.

2744
01:40:54,530 --> 01:40:57,190
You know, I sent them a picture of my ID and stuff.

2745
01:40:58,850 --> 01:40:59,330
Um...

2746
01:40:59,330 --> 01:41:00,690
My ID, like...

2747
01:41:00,690 --> 01:41:02,750
Last month or some shit.

2748
01:41:02,950 --> 01:41:03,390
Or, like...

2749
01:41:03,390 --> 01:41:04,230
Yeah, last month.

2750
01:41:05,250 --> 01:41:05,730
Um...

2751
01:41:05,730 --> 01:41:07,450
Because I was like, everybody has my...

2752
01:41:07,450 --> 01:41:10,350
You know, every tech company has my information now.

2753
01:41:10,370 --> 01:41:11,410
Like, at that point...

2754
01:41:13,430 --> 01:41:15,010
You know, you're like...

2755
01:41:15,010 --> 01:41:16,010
I feel like...

2756
01:41:16,010 --> 01:41:19,290
At that point, I was like, I think Elon Musk already knows who I am.

2757
01:41:19,290 --> 01:41:20,550
Like, at that point, like...

2758
01:41:20,550 --> 01:41:22,370
It's just basically, like...

2759
01:41:22,370 --> 01:41:23,170
Does it really matter?

2760
01:41:23,210 --> 01:41:26,110
I'm pretty sure he already has that information already.

2761
01:41:26,730 --> 01:41:27,130
So...

2762
01:41:27,990 --> 01:41:28,790
He's literally...

2763
01:41:28,790 --> 01:41:30,950
Okay, it's a little scary to think about.

2764
01:41:31,770 --> 01:41:32,570
But, um...

2765
01:41:32,570 --> 01:41:33,750
He is the...

2766
01:41:33,750 --> 01:41:35,870
He's gonna be, like, the first...

2767
01:41:35,870 --> 01:41:36,810
He's gonna be the...

2768
01:41:36,810 --> 01:41:37,190
He's, like...

2769
01:41:37,190 --> 01:41:39,470
He's heading towards becoming the richest man in the world.

2770
01:41:39,590 --> 01:41:39,810
You know?

2771
01:41:39,890 --> 01:41:40,930
That's, like, the scary thought.

2772
01:41:41,250 --> 01:41:42,970
And then, at that point, I was like, you know what?

2773
01:41:43,030 --> 01:41:44,750
Like, I'm pretty sure he already has it.

2774
01:41:47,030 --> 01:41:49,170
So, that's why I was like, oh, why am I...

2775
01:41:49,170 --> 01:41:49,550
What the fuck?

2776
01:41:49,650 --> 01:41:50,350
I might as well...

2777
01:41:50,350 --> 01:41:53,890
I might as well just actually get my...

2778
01:41:53,890 --> 01:41:55,190
The monetization back.

2779
01:41:55,750 --> 01:41:56,170
And...

2780
01:41:57,070 --> 01:41:58,810
And because of that...

2781
01:41:58,810 --> 01:41:59,570
Because...

2782
01:41:59,570 --> 01:42:00,350
Don't...

2783
01:42:00,350 --> 01:42:00,690
The...

2784
01:42:00,690 --> 01:42:04,010
Why I was, like, thinking about getting my monetization back...

2785
01:42:04,010 --> 01:42:06,450
Was because, literally, the monetization thing...

2786
01:42:06,450 --> 01:42:08,650
Pays for my Twitter premium.

2787
01:42:09,190 --> 01:42:09,670
So...

2788
01:42:09,670 --> 01:42:11,190
It's just, like...

2789
01:42:11,190 --> 01:42:11,430
I...

2790
01:42:11,430 --> 01:42:13,110
Technically, it's just free premium.

2791
01:42:13,430 --> 01:42:13,710
You know?

2792
01:42:13,710 --> 01:42:15,390
That's why I was like, okay, I should...

2793
01:42:15,390 --> 01:42:16,090
You know?

2794
01:42:16,370 --> 01:42:18,070
I should tweet a little bit more.

2795
01:42:18,650 --> 01:42:21,030
Because, so, at least, like, if I don't have...

2796
01:42:21,030 --> 01:42:22,070
Technically, like...

2797
01:42:22,070 --> 01:42:23,030
They're not getting...

2798
01:42:23,030 --> 01:42:24,830
They're losing money by me...

2799
01:42:26,150 --> 01:42:27,070
Buying premium.

2800
01:42:28,610 --> 01:42:30,270
So, like, it's...

2801
01:42:30,270 --> 01:42:31,810
Like, you're already, like, what?

2802
01:42:31,970 --> 01:42:32,530
A quad...

2803
01:42:32,530 --> 01:42:33,450
I don't even remember.

2804
01:42:33,970 --> 01:42:35,030
He was like, what?

2805
01:42:35,170 --> 01:42:36,090
He's like, eh...

2806
01:42:37,350 --> 01:42:38,730
What's his word again?

2807
01:42:39,350 --> 01:42:39,830
Where...

2808
01:42:39,830 --> 01:42:42,170
The amount of wealth he's gonna be.

2809
01:42:42,170 --> 01:42:44,090
Like, for being the richest man in the world.

2810
01:42:44,450 --> 01:42:44,590
Oh, yeah.

2811
01:42:44,810 --> 01:42:46,270
True linear or whatever.

2812
01:42:46,510 --> 01:42:46,890
True linear.

2813
01:42:47,150 --> 01:42:48,290
And I was just like...

2814
01:42:48,290 --> 01:42:49,210
Bro, like...

2815
01:42:50,630 --> 01:42:52,170
I'm just thinking, like...

2816
01:42:53,790 --> 01:42:54,250
Um...

2817
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:55,630
Yeah, he's literally...

2818
01:42:55,630 --> 01:42:58,010
He's giving me money...

2819
01:42:58,010 --> 01:43:00,090
To have Twitter premium.

2820
01:43:00,670 --> 01:43:02,530
So, I was like, might as well.

2821
01:43:02,750 --> 01:43:02,970
You know?

2822
01:43:05,970 --> 01:43:08,030
The more I tweet, the more...

2823
01:43:08,030 --> 01:43:09,710
The more he's...

2824
01:43:09,710 --> 01:43:10,850
Paying me.

2825
01:43:11,730 --> 01:43:13,790
Instead of me buying Twitter premium.

2826
01:43:15,950 --> 01:43:16,430
Uh...

2827
01:43:17,310 --> 01:43:17,790
Uh...

2828
01:43:17,790 --> 01:43:18,030
Uh...

2829
01:43:18,030 --> 01:43:18,670
Maxi...

2830
01:43:18,670 --> 01:43:19,270
Yakov...

2831
01:43:19,270 --> 01:43:20,370
Thank you for the super chat.

2832
01:43:20,470 --> 01:43:20,730
Thank you.

2833
01:43:20,870 --> 01:43:21,430
Thank you.

2834
01:43:22,050 --> 01:43:22,530
Um...

2835
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:23,390
After...

2836
01:43:23,390 --> 01:43:24,210
Thank you for the super chat.

2837
01:43:24,330 --> 01:43:24,570
Thank you.

2838
01:43:24,670 --> 01:43:25,290
Thank you.

2839
01:43:25,770 --> 01:43:26,210
Joki...

2840
01:43:26,210 --> 01:43:27,270
Oh, I already read that.

2841
01:43:27,450 --> 01:43:27,950
But think again.

2842
01:43:28,610 --> 01:43:30,110
So, you buy premium to take money.

2843
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:31,790
Well, I buy premium...

2844
01:43:31,790 --> 01:43:33,310
To have free premium.

2845
01:43:33,630 --> 01:43:34,610
I know it's like...

2846
01:43:34,610 --> 01:43:35,010
Really...

2847
01:43:35,010 --> 01:43:35,550
It's...

2848
01:43:36,110 --> 01:43:36,550
It's...

2849
01:43:36,550 --> 01:43:37,350
It's so weird.

2850
01:43:37,570 --> 01:43:37,750
I...

2851
01:43:37,750 --> 01:43:38,150
I know.

2852
01:43:38,290 --> 01:43:38,810
It's like...

2853
01:43:38,810 --> 01:43:40,050
It's such a weird method.

2854
01:43:40,330 --> 01:43:42,990
You get premium just so that you can have it for free.

2855
01:43:44,730 --> 01:43:45,290
Uh...

2856
01:43:45,290 --> 01:43:47,030
Because like...

2857
01:43:47,030 --> 01:43:51,370
The amount I make monthly off of Twitter premium...

2858
01:43:51,370 --> 01:43:52,410
Is...

2859
01:43:52,410 --> 01:43:53,510
Um...

2860
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:54,150
The amount...

2861
01:43:54,150 --> 01:43:54,330
Like...

2862
01:43:54,330 --> 01:43:55,890
It pays off for Twitter premium.

2863
01:43:56,250 --> 01:43:57,230
If not, like...

2864
01:43:57,230 --> 01:43:58,870
I get more than what I pay for.

2865
01:43:59,150 --> 01:44:01,930
So technically, it's free premium plus extra money.

2866
01:44:02,390 --> 01:44:02,730
Yeah.

2867
01:44:02,890 --> 01:44:03,330
It pays...

2868
01:44:03,330 --> 01:44:04,690
Basically, it pays for itself.

2869
01:44:04,910 --> 01:44:07,230
And I like Twitter premium because...

2870
01:44:07,230 --> 01:44:07,990
Um...

2871
01:44:07,990 --> 01:44:09,110
I get to edit my tweets.

2872
01:44:09,550 --> 01:44:11,410
Like, Twitter premium isn't for anyone, buddy.

2873
01:44:11,410 --> 01:44:11,870
Everybody.

2874
01:44:12,210 --> 01:44:13,390
But for me, it's just...

2875
01:44:13,390 --> 01:44:15,030
I just like the fact that I can edit tweets.

2876
01:44:15,030 --> 01:44:16,430
And I can post longer videos.

2877
01:44:16,690 --> 01:44:17,630
That's really it.

2878
01:44:18,950 --> 01:44:19,430
Um...

2879
01:44:19,430 --> 01:44:20,810
And as a content creator...

2880
01:44:20,810 --> 01:44:22,690
I feel like you sort of need that.

2881
01:44:22,870 --> 01:44:23,050
You know?

2882
01:44:23,250 --> 01:44:23,470
Like...

2883
01:44:23,470 --> 01:44:23,610
Yeah.

2884
01:44:23,610 --> 01:44:24,770
It's an infinite money glitch.

2885
01:44:24,910 --> 01:44:27,190
I'm literally getting free money from Twitter.

2886
01:44:28,210 --> 01:44:28,690
Uh...

2887
01:44:29,550 --> 01:44:30,030
Yeah.

2888
01:44:30,310 --> 01:44:31,990
And I don't get ads too.

2889
01:44:32,210 --> 01:44:32,810
Which is nice.

2890
01:44:34,490 --> 01:44:36,930
You're probably making bank off this week.

2891
01:44:37,290 --> 01:44:38,110
Dot quote.

2892
01:44:38,350 --> 01:44:39,130
I don't know.

2893
01:44:39,970 --> 01:44:40,450
Um...

2894
01:44:40,450 --> 01:44:41,830
How much is Twitter premium?

2895
01:44:42,010 --> 01:44:46,130
I don't have the extra Twitter premium where I can have Grok become an anime girl.

2896
01:44:46,270 --> 01:44:46,450
Sorry.

2897
01:44:46,450 --> 01:44:48,670
I don't have Grok premium plus or whatever.

2898
01:44:49,010 --> 01:44:50,810
I was so surprised that existed.

2899
01:44:51,010 --> 01:44:53,210
I was like, people pay for Grok plus?

2900
01:44:53,510 --> 01:44:53,990
Like...

2901
01:44:53,990 --> 01:44:55,290
Grok plus exists?

2902
01:44:55,450 --> 01:44:59,170
Like, so you can have your AI wear a fucking lingerie?

2903
01:44:59,290 --> 01:44:59,930
Oh my god.

2904
01:44:59,930 --> 01:45:01,410
Maybe I should pay for that.

2905
01:45:01,410 --> 01:45:01,970
Like...

2906
01:45:02,790 --> 01:45:03,550
Like...

2907
01:45:03,550 --> 01:45:04,290
Like...

2908
01:45:04,290 --> 01:45:04,670
But...

2909
01:45:04,670 --> 01:45:05,610
Like...

2910
01:45:05,610 --> 01:45:06,230
Like...

2911
01:45:06,230 --> 01:45:07,050
Um...

2912
01:45:07,050 --> 01:45:08,070
How much...

2913
01:45:08,070 --> 01:45:09,010
How much is...

2914
01:45:09,010 --> 01:45:10,110
How much is the...

2915
01:45:10,110 --> 01:45:10,470
Okay.

2916
01:45:10,490 --> 01:45:11,190
What am I at?

2917
01:45:11,290 --> 01:45:13,250
I'm subscribed to...

2918
01:45:14,550 --> 01:45:15,310
Uh...

2919
01:45:15,310 --> 01:45:16,710
What am I at?

2920
01:45:16,830 --> 01:45:17,550
I don't even remember.

2921
01:45:20,370 --> 01:45:20,930
Uh...

2922
01:45:20,930 --> 01:45:22,790
Am I at X Pro?

2923
01:45:23,230 --> 01:45:23,570
No.

2924
01:45:24,630 --> 01:45:25,390
Am I?

2925
01:45:25,610 --> 01:45:26,270
I don't know.

2926
01:45:26,530 --> 01:45:27,410
What's X Pro?

2927
01:45:27,730 --> 01:45:28,870
I just clicked X Pro.

2928
01:45:29,390 --> 01:45:30,470
Open display.

2929
01:45:30,470 --> 01:45:30,930
Oh!

2930
01:45:31,450 --> 01:45:31,650
Oh!

2931
01:45:31,750 --> 01:45:31,950
Oh!

2932
01:45:31,950 --> 01:45:34,030
So you can have a little Twitter deck thing.

2933
01:45:34,870 --> 01:45:35,570
Uh...

2934
01:45:36,550 --> 01:45:37,250
Um...

2935
01:45:37,820 --> 01:45:39,970
It's not even that well made.

2936
01:45:40,350 --> 01:45:41,010
Look...

2937
01:45:41,010 --> 01:45:42,810
People just want...

2938
01:45:42,810 --> 01:45:43,370
People...

2939
01:45:43,370 --> 01:45:44,150
Oh, let me say...

2940
01:45:44,150 --> 01:45:45,150
I think...

2941
01:45:45,150 --> 01:45:46,270
Basically, like...

2942
01:45:46,270 --> 01:45:50,690
As long as there is a hot anime woman in lingerie...

2943
01:45:50,690 --> 01:45:51,390
I don't...

2944
01:45:51,390 --> 01:45:52,050
For those...

2945
01:45:52,050 --> 01:45:52,430
Like...

2946
01:45:52,430 --> 01:45:56,870
I think, like, the feature for the extra Grok was literally just...

2947
01:45:56,870 --> 01:45:59,470
Hot anime woman in lingerie.

2948
01:45:59,470 --> 01:46:00,010
Like...

2949
01:46:00,010 --> 01:46:02,650
I don't think they're looking for anything else after...

2950
01:46:03,490 --> 01:46:04,090
Like...

2951
01:46:04,090 --> 01:46:05,910
I don't think...

2952
01:46:05,910 --> 01:46:09,090
I don't think they're, like, looking for more than that.

2953
01:46:09,250 --> 01:46:10,750
If that was the feature.

2954
01:46:12,490 --> 01:46:13,090
Uh...

2955
01:46:14,870 --> 01:46:17,450
I don't think they, like, want more.

2956
01:46:20,910 --> 01:46:21,510
Uh...

2957
01:46:22,230 --> 01:46:24,850
As long as it provides that...

2958
01:46:24,850 --> 01:46:26,370
I think they're happy.

2959
01:46:26,370 --> 01:46:28,030
I don't even know which...

2960
01:46:28,030 --> 01:46:28,890
One I...

2961
01:46:28,890 --> 01:46:30,670
Which one I subscribe to in premium.

2962
01:46:31,370 --> 01:46:32,490
Does it tell you?

2963
01:46:32,670 --> 01:46:33,650
I don't even...

2964
01:46:33,650 --> 01:46:35,030
Premium manage.

2965
01:46:36,750 --> 01:46:37,310
Oh...

2966
01:46:37,310 --> 01:46:37,570
Oh...

2967
01:46:37,570 --> 01:46:38,570
The one that I pay...

2968
01:46:38,570 --> 01:46:39,370
I pay yearly.

2969
01:46:39,650 --> 01:46:40,610
So it's, like...

2970
01:46:40,610 --> 01:46:41,750
A hundred...

2971
01:46:41,750 --> 01:46:42,650
Dollars...

2972
01:46:42,650 --> 01:46:44,210
A hundred Canadian dollars...

2973
01:46:44,210 --> 01:46:44,670
A year?

2974
01:46:45,110 --> 01:46:46,030
Mine's just premium.

2975
01:46:46,990 --> 01:46:47,550
But...

2976
01:46:47,550 --> 01:46:48,530
Um...

2977
01:46:49,470 --> 01:46:50,430
I basically...

2978
01:46:50,430 --> 01:46:52,030
I get, like...

2979
01:46:52,030 --> 01:46:52,650
Um...

2980
01:46:52,650 --> 01:46:55,150
I don't know how much that is with each month, but...

2981
01:46:55,150 --> 01:46:56,690
Every month...

2982
01:46:56,690 --> 01:46:58,090
Every month...

2983
01:46:58,090 --> 01:46:59,870
I make, like...

2984
01:46:59,870 --> 01:47:01,930
Like, how much did I make last time?

2985
01:47:03,330 --> 01:47:04,730
I make, like...

2986
01:47:04,730 --> 01:47:04,950
Yeah...

2987
01:47:04,950 --> 01:47:06,390
Oh, it's eight dollars a month.

2988
01:47:06,590 --> 01:47:08,570
Yeah, it's eight dollars Canadian a month.

2989
01:47:08,910 --> 01:47:09,390
But...

2990
01:47:09,390 --> 01:47:10,870
I don't mind telling you guys what I get.

2991
01:47:11,870 --> 01:47:12,230
Um...

2992
01:47:12,230 --> 01:47:13,410
Each month...

2993
01:47:13,410 --> 01:47:14,250
I get...

2994
01:47:15,010 --> 01:47:15,370
Around...

2995
01:47:15,850 --> 01:47:16,210
Seventy...

2996
01:47:16,210 --> 01:47:17,850
To a hundred dollars a month.

2997
01:47:18,190 --> 01:47:19,270
So, like...

2998
01:47:22,850 --> 01:47:23,650
So, like...

2999
01:47:23,650 --> 01:47:24,290
Each month...

3000
01:47:24,290 --> 01:47:26,450
I basically get an extra year of premium.

3001
01:47:27,470 --> 01:47:27,830
Okay.

3002
01:47:29,890 --> 01:47:30,090
Yeah.

3003
01:47:30,270 --> 01:47:31,530
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

3004
01:47:31,630 --> 01:47:31,910
Thank you.

3005
01:47:32,030 --> 01:47:32,570
Thank you.

3006
01:47:32,930 --> 01:47:34,550
At this point where I think that...

3007
01:47:34,550 --> 01:47:35,590
When that feature came out...

3008
01:47:35,590 --> 01:47:37,250
It was extremely predatory to learn.

3009
01:47:37,390 --> 01:47:38,670
It's sort of depressing, to be honest.

3010
01:47:38,810 --> 01:47:39,550
Thank you for the super chat.

3011
01:47:39,670 --> 01:47:39,890
Thank you.

3012
01:47:39,990 --> 01:47:40,370
Thank you.

3013
01:47:40,370 --> 01:47:41,690
Yeah, so, like...

3014
01:47:41,690 --> 01:47:42,410
It was just...

3015
01:47:42,410 --> 01:47:45,570
Yeah, that's, like, at least one Uber meal per month.

3016
01:47:46,050 --> 01:47:47,090
Yeah, I should have...

3017
01:47:47,090 --> 01:47:48,490
I should have, like...

3018
01:47:48,490 --> 01:47:48,950
Done...

3019
01:47:48,950 --> 01:47:50,050
I should have fixed that...

3020
01:47:50,510 --> 01:47:50,910
Earlier.

3021
01:47:50,950 --> 01:47:51,930
Because I stopped.

3022
01:47:52,450 --> 01:47:53,250
I stopped.

3023
01:47:53,630 --> 01:47:53,890
I...

3024
01:47:53,890 --> 01:47:55,350
Like, when they asked for, like...

3025
01:47:55,350 --> 01:47:56,390
Your ID...

3026
01:47:56,390 --> 01:47:57,690
Pictures of your ID and stuff.

3027
01:47:57,930 --> 01:47:59,190
It was around...

3028
01:47:59,190 --> 01:48:01,470
July 5th, 2024.

3029
01:48:01,990 --> 01:48:03,050
Because that's where it stopped.

3030
01:48:03,510 --> 01:48:05,030
And then I was, like...

3031
01:48:05,030 --> 01:48:05,730
I was just, like...

3032
01:48:05,730 --> 01:48:06,650
And I just got lazy.

3033
01:48:06,830 --> 01:48:08,410
Because my ID was, like, in my wallet.

3034
01:48:08,650 --> 01:48:09,750
And at that time...

3035
01:48:09,750 --> 01:48:11,330
My wallet was, like, pretty far.

3036
01:48:11,450 --> 01:48:12,690
Like, was in the next room.

3037
01:48:12,850 --> 01:48:13,530
And I was, like...

3038
01:48:13,530 --> 01:48:14,330
I'll do that tomorrow.

3039
01:48:14,550 --> 01:48:15,910
And then I never did that tomorrow.

3040
01:48:16,050 --> 01:48:16,450
And then...

3041
01:48:16,450 --> 01:48:18,870
And then that tomorrow never happened.

3042
01:48:19,290 --> 01:48:19,670
Like...

3043
01:48:28,590 --> 01:48:30,430
Last month, I was, like...

3044
01:48:30,430 --> 01:48:30,650
Oh, yeah.

3045
01:48:30,810 --> 01:48:31,870
I should really do that.

3046
01:48:32,050 --> 01:48:33,270
I should...

3047
01:48:33,270 --> 01:48:34,890
Literally a year later.

3048
01:48:35,110 --> 01:48:35,810
Oh, my God.

3049
01:48:35,930 --> 01:48:36,090
Yeah.

3050
01:48:36,310 --> 01:48:37,450
A year later.

3051
01:48:37,510 --> 01:48:40,350
On July 4th, 2025.

3052
01:48:40,970 --> 01:48:45,410
I finally registered my ID on Twitter.

3053
01:48:45,410 --> 01:48:49,290
I was, like, happy anniversary and birthday.

3054
01:48:49,870 --> 01:48:52,050
I guess I should just give them my ID.

3055
01:48:53,950 --> 01:48:54,610
Yippee!

3056
01:48:56,630 --> 01:48:57,290
Finally.

3057
01:48:59,630 --> 01:49:00,290
Acrox.

3058
01:49:00,390 --> 01:49:01,050
Is this real?

3059
01:49:04,720 --> 01:49:06,980
Should I upload ID to questionable companies?

3060
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:07,900
I'm...

3061
01:49:07,900 --> 01:49:09,060
Oh, they already have it.

3062
01:49:10,340 --> 01:49:12,160
They already have my information.

3063
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:13,200
I...

3064
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:18,400
I...

3065
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:23,760
I'm feeling cute today.

3066
01:49:23,900 --> 01:49:25,580
I might show my ID to Twitter.

3067
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:27,440
Um...

3068
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:31,480
Oh, my God.

3069
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:32,500
It's already been two hours?

3070
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:34,200
Oh, my gosh.

3071
01:49:34,300 --> 01:49:34,760
Oh, my gosh.

3072
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:35,040
Okay.

3073
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:36,500
I know I'm, like, super behind.

3074
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:38,640
But, like...

3075
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:40,040
Oh, my gosh.

3076
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:40,620
I'm, like, thinking.

3077
01:49:40,700 --> 01:49:41,760
Do I talk about this?

3078
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:43,200
Like...

3079
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:49,960
I'm thinking, like...

3080
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:51,920
No, maybe I shouldn't talk about this.

3081
01:49:57,580 --> 01:49:58,180
Guys.

3082
01:49:59,100 --> 01:49:59,620
Guys.

3083
01:50:00,420 --> 01:50:03,120
It was so wild when Elmo got hacked.

3084
01:50:08,540 --> 01:50:12,000
I can't believe they hacked Elmo.

3085
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:13,140
I...

3086
01:50:13,140 --> 01:50:13,540
I...

3087
01:50:15,120 --> 01:50:16,600
That was...

3088
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:18,880
That was so wild.

3089
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:19,300
Okay.

3090
01:50:19,700 --> 01:50:20,960
My favorite...

3091
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:21,140
Okay.

3092
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:24,540
I know, like, there's a favorite part, Dookie.

3093
01:50:25,020 --> 01:50:26,120
But, like...

3094
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:26,800
My favorite...

3095
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:27,140
Like...

3096
01:50:27,140 --> 01:50:30,640
When I found out about Elmo...

3097
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:33,300
Elmo was so wild.

3098
01:50:33,300 --> 01:50:34,080
But, like...

3099
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:36,760
My favorite part...

3100
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:38,840
About the Elmo hack...

3101
01:50:38,840 --> 01:50:39,680
Was because...

3102
01:50:39,680 --> 01:50:41,560
I found out...

3103
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:42,600
From the screenshot...

3104
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:47,840
Like...

3105
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:48,420
Like...

3106
01:50:48,420 --> 01:50:49,340
Because I was...

3107
01:50:49,340 --> 01:50:50,640
You know, like...

3108
01:50:50,640 --> 01:50:52,640
Like, the quote retweet...

3109
01:50:52,640 --> 01:50:54,120
And I was like...

3110
01:51:02,780 --> 01:51:05,580
Yeah, from the smile...

3111
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:09,360
Yeah...

3112
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:10,000
Yeah...

3113
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:10,900
It was...

3114
01:51:10,900 --> 01:51:12,080
It was crazy.

3115
01:51:12,540 --> 01:51:12,960
I was like...

3116
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:13,440
Elmo...

3117
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:14,200
No!

3118
01:51:14,700 --> 01:51:15,340
No!

3119
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:17,340
What happened, Elmo?

3120
01:51:17,340 --> 01:51:17,460
No!

3121
01:51:20,100 --> 01:51:20,800
Please!

3122
01:51:21,580 --> 01:51:22,280
Please!

3123
01:51:22,940 --> 01:51:23,500
You can't...

3124
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:26,940
After getting canceled, Elmo went off the deep end.

3125
01:51:27,380 --> 01:51:28,340
Yeah, they hacked Elmo.

3126
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:29,340
That's crazy.

3127
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:30,600
Out of any account...

3128
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:31,780
I would assume...

3129
01:51:31,780 --> 01:51:32,670
To be fair...

3130
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:36,410
To be fair, though...

3131
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:38,530
I would assume...

3132
01:51:39,560 --> 01:51:40,260
The...

3133
01:51:40,260 --> 01:51:41,260
Um...

3134
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:43,460
I would assume...

3135
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:44,580
The...

3136
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:47,040
The...

3137
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:47,500
The...

3138
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:47,900
Um...

3139
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:49,540
The security...

3140
01:51:49,540 --> 01:51:50,660
For Elmo's...

3141
01:51:50,660 --> 01:51:51,740
Elmo's account...

3142
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:53,620
From fucking Sesame Street...

3143
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:54,440
That...

3144
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:56,140
Is not...

3145
01:51:56,140 --> 01:51:56,680
That...

3146
01:51:56,680 --> 01:51:56,840
Tight.

3147
01:51:57,340 --> 01:51:58,500
Like, that's...

3148
01:51:58,500 --> 01:51:59,260
I...

3149
01:51:59,980 --> 01:52:01,560
I swear to god...

3150
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:02,620
I feel like I can...

3151
01:52:02,620 --> 01:52:05,680
Like, imagine the scenario...

3152
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:06,620
On how...

3153
01:52:07,140 --> 01:52:08,860
Elmo's account got hacked.

3154
01:52:09,340 --> 01:52:10,260
But just...

3155
01:52:10,260 --> 01:52:11,180
Some guy...

3156
01:52:11,180 --> 01:52:13,660
Literally just sent a phishing email...

3157
01:52:13,660 --> 01:52:14,640
To like...

3158
01:52:14,640 --> 01:52:14,880
The...

3159
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:16,620
The Sesame Street...

3160
01:52:17,220 --> 01:52:18,860
Social media...

3161
01:52:19,620 --> 01:52:20,140
Workers...

3162
01:52:20,140 --> 01:52:22,600
And then the guy just clicked on a link...

3163
01:52:22,600 --> 01:52:24,020
And then got the account!

3164
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:24,860
I...

3165
01:52:24,860 --> 01:52:26,200
I feel like...

3166
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:26,800
I...

3167
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:30,380
I feel like it's not that difficult to hack Elmo.

3168
01:52:30,380 --> 01:52:32,500
If you think about like...

3169
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:33,120
Like...

3170
01:52:33,120 --> 01:52:34,680
Sesame Street...

3171
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:34,900
I...

3172
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:35,640
I...

3173
01:52:35,640 --> 01:52:36,880
100% bet you...

3174
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:37,100
That...

3175
01:52:37,100 --> 01:52:38,860
That's how Elmo got hacked.

3176
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:41,500
They literally just sent a phishing email...

3177
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:42,600
To like...

3178
01:52:42,600 --> 01:52:43,820
The Sesame Street...

3179
01:52:43,820 --> 01:52:45,040
Social media workers...

3180
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:45,360
And...

3181
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:47,940
I assume they do not get paid that much...

3182
01:52:47,940 --> 01:52:48,780
Because...

3183
01:52:48,780 --> 01:52:49,700
It's public...

3184
01:52:49,700 --> 01:52:50,640
TV...

3185
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:51,680
And like...

3186
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:52,420
Cause like...

3187
01:52:52,420 --> 01:52:53,600
You know...

3188
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:54,800
It's PBS...

3189
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:55,400
Public Broadcasting...

3190
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:57,380
It's public broadcasting...

3191
01:52:57,940 --> 01:52:58,160
Like...

3192
01:52:58,160 --> 01:52:58,660
And...

3193
01:52:58,660 --> 01:53:00,960
I assume they don't get paid that much...

3194
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:02,080
To like...

3195
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:03,400
Properly check the...

3196
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:05,440
The links that they get sent...

3197
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:06,380
Yeah...

3198
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:08,120
Hahaha...

3199
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:09,640
Hahaha...

3200
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:10,840
Yeah...

3201
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:11,400
So like...

3202
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:11,660
I'm not...

3203
01:53:11,660 --> 01:53:13,440
I'm not surprised...

3204
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:14,840
That that happened...

3205
01:53:14,840 --> 01:53:15,520
It was just...

3206
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:16,160
It was...

3207
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:18,020
It was so fucking crazy...

3208
01:53:18,020 --> 01:53:19,160
When that happened...

3209
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:20,540
Yeah...

3210
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:28,140
Hahaha...

3211
01:53:28,140 --> 01:53:28,840
Okay...

3212
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:29,500
Before I talk...

3213
01:53:29,500 --> 01:53:29,680
Okay...

3214
01:53:29,680 --> 01:53:30,200
I was gonna say...

3215
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:32,280
I'm so sad that the UNO thing wasn't real...

3216
01:53:32,280 --> 01:53:33,200
And it was just...

3217
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:33,860
A lie...

3218
01:53:33,860 --> 01:53:35,780
I can't believe people would lie on the internet...

3219
01:53:35,780 --> 01:53:37,520
And UNO had to make a statement...

3220
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:38,100
Be like...

3221
01:53:38,100 --> 01:53:38,500
Okay...

3222
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:39,020
I don't...

3223
01:53:39,020 --> 01:53:39,800
They were like...

3224
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:40,240
Yeah...

3225
01:53:40,240 --> 01:53:40,660
No...

3226
01:53:41,560 --> 01:53:42,520
We're not...

3227
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:44,340
We're not being...

3228
01:53:44,340 --> 01:53:46,340
Played at casino games...

3229
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:47,880
Hahaha...

3230
01:53:48,640 --> 01:53:49,120
So...

3231
01:53:49,120 --> 01:53:49,720
Um...

3232
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:50,500
There was a...

3233
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:52,000
Temporary...

3234
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:52,840
Setup...

3235
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:53,640
For UNO...

3236
01:53:53,640 --> 01:53:54,000
For like...

3237
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:54,760
Competitive...

3238
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:54,940
Like...

3239
01:53:55,760 --> 01:53:56,140
Gambling...

3240
01:53:56,140 --> 01:53:57,340
Uno for gambling...

3241
01:53:57,340 --> 01:53:59,040
But it was only there for...

3242
01:53:59,040 --> 01:53:59,940
Two days...

3243
01:53:59,940 --> 01:54:00,960
Apparently...

3244
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:01,460
Um...

3245
01:54:01,460 --> 01:54:01,920
So...

3246
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:03,760
It was basically like...

3247
01:54:05,020 --> 01:54:05,640
Um...

3248
01:54:05,640 --> 01:54:06,440
Basically...

3249
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:08,200
But it was only for two days...

3250
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:09,760
At one casino...

3251
01:54:11,020 --> 01:54:11,640
Um...

3252
01:54:11,640 --> 01:54:12,420
Um...

3253
01:54:12,420 --> 01:54:14,140
As like a special promotion...

3254
01:54:14,140 --> 01:54:14,900
Or something...

3255
01:54:14,900 --> 01:54:15,780
And then...

3256
01:54:15,780 --> 01:54:18,920
And then everybody thought they were actually introducing UNO...

3257
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:19,860
To like...

3258
01:54:19,860 --> 01:54:20,140
Uh...

3259
01:54:20,140 --> 01:54:22,020
Casinos in Las Vegas...

3260
01:54:22,020 --> 01:54:22,900
Um...

3261
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:23,920
So everyone was like...

3262
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:24,660
Freaking out...

3263
01:54:24,760 --> 01:54:26,140
Because like...

3264
01:54:26,140 --> 01:54:27,040
Hahaha...

3265
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:27,440
I...

3266
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:28,580
I love this...

3267
01:54:28,580 --> 01:54:29,780
There was this tweet...

3268
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:30,740
That was like...

3269
01:54:30,740 --> 01:54:32,840
When you lose a thousand dollars...

3270
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:35,040
Because you forgot to say UNO...

3271
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:35,280
Like...

3272
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:36,300
Just imagine...

3273
01:54:36,300 --> 01:54:37,600
I would watch that...

3274
01:54:37,600 --> 01:54:38,820
Not gonna lie...

3275
01:54:38,820 --> 01:54:40,760
I feel like competitive UNO...

3276
01:54:41,300 --> 01:54:41,840
Is...

3277
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:42,930
Like competitive UNO...

3278
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:43,850
With gambling...

3279
01:54:44,460 --> 01:54:44,900
Is...

3280
01:54:44,900 --> 01:54:47,440
Might be much more interesting to watch...

3281
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:48,830
Than actual poker...

3282
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:50,780
Because imagine you...

3283
01:54:50,780 --> 01:54:51,780
Imagine like...

3284
01:54:51,780 --> 01:54:52,820
You're locked in...

3285
01:54:52,820 --> 01:54:54,600
Because you have to say UNO...

3286
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:55,480
You're like...

3287
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:55,720
Okay...

3288
01:54:55,720 --> 01:54:56,460
This guy...

3289
01:54:56,460 --> 01:54:57,380
Like in your head...

3290
01:54:57,380 --> 01:54:59,220
You're doing your own mind palace thing...

3291
01:54:59,220 --> 01:55:00,520
And in your head...

3292
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:01,140
You're just like...

3293
01:55:01,140 --> 01:55:01,600
Okay...

3294
01:55:01,600 --> 01:55:02,260
This guy...

3295
01:55:02,260 --> 01:55:03,140
He has two cards...

3296
01:55:03,140 --> 01:55:04,420
If it's the reverse card...

3297
01:55:04,420 --> 01:55:04,820
And then...

3298
01:55:04,820 --> 01:55:05,680
That means...

3299
01:55:05,680 --> 01:55:06,260
Um...

3300
01:55:06,260 --> 01:55:06,900
If it's...

3301
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:08,320
Um...

3302
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:11,600
He puts...

3303
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:12,560
Two blue ones...

3304
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:13,200
Then...

3305
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:15,020
That means he's gonna have one card...

3306
01:55:15,020 --> 01:55:16,340
So I have to get ready...

3307
01:55:16,340 --> 01:55:17,160
To say UNO...

3308
01:55:17,160 --> 01:55:19,000
When he puts those two cards down...

3309
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:19,500
The mo...

3310
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:20,120
And then...

3311
01:55:20,120 --> 01:55:21,740
It's just like...

3312
01:55:21,740 --> 01:55:22,160
The...

3313
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:22,480
Like...

3314
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:24,040
The amount of like...

3315
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:24,580
Of...

3316
01:55:25,260 --> 01:55:25,880
Thinking...

3317
01:55:25,880 --> 01:55:26,360
And like...

3318
01:55:26,360 --> 01:55:27,060
Prediction...

3319
01:55:27,060 --> 01:55:28,280
You have to do...

3320
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:29,380
And then like...

3321
01:55:29,380 --> 01:55:30,240
Having a...

3322
01:55:30,240 --> 01:55:31,240
Poker face...

3323
01:55:31,240 --> 01:55:32,900
For fucking UNO...

3324
01:55:32,900 --> 01:55:33,500
Like...

3325
01:55:34,410 --> 01:55:35,180
Oh yeah...

3326
01:55:35,180 --> 01:55:36,720
And then counting cards...

3327
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:37,580
And you're like...

3328
01:55:37,580 --> 01:55:38,000
Okay...

3329
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:38,860
So this guy...

3330
01:55:38,860 --> 01:55:40,680
So we've currently put down...

3331
01:55:40,680 --> 01:55:41,540
Five...

3332
01:55:41,540 --> 01:55:42,640
Plus twos...

3333
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:43,860
There's only six...

3334
01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:44,700
Plus twos...

3335
01:55:44,700 --> 01:55:45,320
Left...

3336
01:55:45,320 --> 01:55:45,760
There's only...

3337
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:46,160
There's...

3338
01:55:46,160 --> 01:55:47,360
Six plus twos...

3339
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:48,240
In the deck...

3340
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:48,660
Um...

3341
01:55:48,660 --> 01:55:50,380
So only one person has...

3342
01:55:50,380 --> 01:55:52,440
One more plus two...

3343
01:55:52,440 --> 01:55:52,840
Uh...

3344
01:55:57,180 --> 01:55:57,520
God...

3345
01:55:57,860 --> 01:55:58,700
Code...

3346
01:55:58,700 --> 01:56:00,380
Thank you for the super chat...

3347
01:56:00,380 --> 01:56:01,100
Thank you...

3348
01:56:01,100 --> 01:56:02,400
Thank you...

3349
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:02,880
Yeah...

3350
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:04,380
But yeah...

3351
01:56:04,380 --> 01:56:06,060
I just thought it was fuck killer...

3352
01:56:06,060 --> 01:56:07,200
Imagine just losing...

3353
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:08,460
Just cause you forgot to say...

3354
01:56:08,460 --> 01:56:11,440
Ooh, no, that's gonna be so... that's so fucked up.

3355
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:20,600
But anyway, this was... okay, I just realized what time it is.

3356
01:56:20,720 --> 01:56:25,380
And I did say today might be a short stream, but this is my last thing I want to talk about.

3357
01:56:25,660 --> 01:56:32,280
But I just found out that the dog... the dog in Superman is motion-captured.

3358
01:56:32,580 --> 01:56:37,340
I was like... and I thought it was so fucking funny because like...

3359
01:56:37,340 --> 01:56:42,320
there's... because like I saw the super dog scenes like Krypto.

3360
01:56:42,520 --> 01:56:44,800
And I was like, oh my god, that's a real person.

3361
01:56:46,740 --> 01:56:51,640
It's like, yeah, yeah, someone was actually... was like motion...

3362
01:56:51,640 --> 01:56:55,720
Yeah, someone actually like motion-captured Krypto in Superman.

3363
01:56:56,080 --> 01:57:01,100
Like, so now like... now for me, it's like a little weird because now I...

3364
01:57:02,100 --> 01:57:04,880
Because all I can think about is how like...

3365
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:08,920
There's a... like, if it was CGI, it's like less weird, I guess.

3366
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:12,740
But then I'm like, there's a real person behind that trying to pretend to be a dog.

3367
01:57:13,060 --> 01:57:14,880
Like, I won't... it's like that...

3368
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:16,780
It's like the Twilight scene.

3369
01:57:18,380 --> 01:57:18,820
Uh...

3370
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:20,260
It's like that...

3371
01:57:20,260 --> 01:57:21,840
Twilight scene...

3372
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:23,700
No, they motion-captured a person.

3373
01:57:25,220 --> 01:57:26,960
It's a real person.

3374
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:29,540
It's a real person.

3375
01:57:29,820 --> 01:57:31,420
I'll show you the like...

3376
01:57:31,420 --> 01:57:33,600
It's a real person behind the dog.

3377
01:57:34,220 --> 01:57:35,060
I am just like...

3378
01:57:35,060 --> 01:57:37,660
It's like reminding me of that Twilight scene...

3379
01:57:37,660 --> 01:57:38,600
Where...

3380
01:57:38,600 --> 01:57:39,220
What was her name?

3381
01:57:39,300 --> 01:57:40,760
Belle was like...

3382
01:57:40,760 --> 01:57:41,380
Um...

3383
01:57:41,380 --> 01:57:42,960
Was like petting...

3384
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:43,860
Jacob's head.

3385
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:46,700
Because he was a wolf and it is...

3386
01:57:46,700 --> 01:57:49,300
It just reminded me of that fucking scene.

3387
01:57:49,460 --> 01:57:50,840
And that's all I could think about.

3388
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:51,540
You guys...

3389
01:57:51,540 --> 01:57:53,260
Okay, Twilight...

3390
01:57:55,260 --> 01:57:55,740
Twilight...

3391
01:57:55,740 --> 01:57:55,900
It's...

3392
01:57:55,900 --> 01:57:57,740
It's such a classic motion-capture.

3393
01:57:57,960 --> 01:57:59,020
It's actually such a...

3394
01:57:59,020 --> 01:57:59,800
I love that...

3395
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:01,080
I love that picture so much.

3396
01:58:01,160 --> 01:58:02,300
But that's all I could think about.

3397
01:58:02,680 --> 01:58:03,160
That's all...

3398
01:58:03,160 --> 01:58:05,420
That's all I could think about.

3399
01:58:05,940 --> 01:58:09,780
They didn't release any photos of it, but...

3400
01:58:09,780 --> 01:58:10,520
Wait, let me...

3401
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:12,280
Save.

3402
01:58:13,100 --> 01:58:14,220
It's such a good...

3403
01:58:14,220 --> 01:58:15,660
It's such a good picture too.

3404
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:18,140
It really is.

3405
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:19,760
It's such a good picture.

3406
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:20,380
I love it.

3407
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:30,100
But, I'm just thinking how it's like that, but for... but for Superman instead.

3408
01:58:31,660 --> 01:58:38,140
Oh yeah, no, I saw the Benedict Cumber Cabbage Patch Kids thing.

3409
01:58:38,900 --> 01:58:40,240
This is like...

3410
01:58:44,460 --> 01:58:45,620
But that's...

3411
01:58:46,660 --> 01:58:52,000
That's all I could think about when I found out that Crypto was motion captured by...

3412
01:58:53,080 --> 01:58:54,780
By a child?

3413
01:58:55,060 --> 01:58:55,360
I don't know.

3414
01:58:55,640 --> 01:58:56,100
Teenager?

3415
01:58:56,440 --> 01:58:57,380
Young woman?

3416
01:59:02,890 --> 01:59:05,090
But those are like, what did it look like?

3417
01:59:05,230 --> 01:59:08,030
This is what it's supposed to look like.

3418
01:59:09,970 --> 01:59:12,090
Oh my god, I've never seen these photos.

3419
01:59:12,250 --> 01:59:13,650
Wait, these photos are so good.

3420
01:59:14,090 --> 01:59:15,090
Wait a minute.

3421
01:59:15,390 --> 01:59:17,910
These photos are actually so good.

3422
01:59:19,910 --> 01:59:20,510
Sorry.

3423
01:59:21,110 --> 01:59:21,570
Sorry.

3424
01:59:21,870 --> 01:59:24,090
Some of this is like, really fucking good.

3425
01:59:24,250 --> 01:59:27,350
And it's so funny to see it again.

3426
01:59:28,070 --> 01:59:29,870
Alright, um...

3427
01:59:30,550 --> 01:59:31,410
Let's see.

3428
01:59:31,550 --> 01:59:34,010
I'm trying to find a good picture for us.

3429
01:59:35,010 --> 01:59:35,750
For us.

3430
01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:37,550
Alright, this one.

3431
01:59:41,980 --> 01:59:44,440
So this is what it's supposed to be.

3432
01:59:45,880 --> 01:59:47,560
And then this...

3433
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:49,660
This is what it turned out.

3434
01:59:56,320 --> 01:59:58,080
I love this picture.

3435
01:59:58,300 --> 01:59:58,960
I don't know.

3436
01:59:59,120 --> 02:00:01,800
I love this picture so fucking much.

3437
02:00:03,140 --> 02:00:04,660
It lives in my head.

3438
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:05,020
It lives in my head.

3439
02:00:05,020 --> 02:00:06,380
I like think about it sometimes.

3440
02:00:06,820 --> 02:00:08,120
It lives in my head, Renfri.

3441
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:09,640
I'll be like, oh my gosh.

3442
02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:10,480
Remember that time?

3443
02:00:10,780 --> 02:00:13,840
Twilight did a motion capture of Jacob on his werewolf form?

3444
02:00:14,140 --> 02:00:16,140
And then he's just...

3445
02:00:16,140 --> 02:00:18,700
And then she's just fucking touching his...

3446
02:00:18,700 --> 02:00:19,680
Rubbing his head?

3447
02:00:20,700 --> 02:00:22,060
You mean it wasn't...

3448
02:00:22,060 --> 02:00:23,780
It wasn't a real wolf?

3449
02:00:24,460 --> 02:00:24,940
Like...

3450
02:00:30,240 --> 02:00:33,080
I can't believe it wasn't a real wolf, guys.

3451
02:00:37,460 --> 02:00:37,940
Anyway.

3452
02:00:38,340 --> 02:00:39,380
I'm gonna call it here, guys.

3453
02:00:40,100 --> 02:00:41,560
Have fun time chatting with y'all.

3454
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,840
I hope y'all have fun time hanging out with me today.

3455
02:00:46,460 --> 02:00:46,860
Um...

3456
02:00:46,860 --> 02:00:49,100
I am gonna have to get back to work.

3457
02:00:49,180 --> 02:00:52,540
Like I said, there's so much behind the scenes stuff to do.

3458
02:00:55,380 --> 02:00:57,380
There's a lot behind the scenes stuff to do.

3459
02:00:57,400 --> 02:00:59,900
So I hope you guys look forward to NASCAR week.

3460
02:01:00,300 --> 02:01:00,700
Um...

3461
02:01:00,700 --> 02:01:02,820
But I hope you guys still have fun.

3462
02:01:03,060 --> 02:01:03,460
Um...

3463
02:01:03,460 --> 02:01:03,980
I know...

3464
02:01:03,980 --> 02:01:05,240
I know some of you guys like...

3465
02:01:05,240 --> 02:01:06,940
Do enjoy my sponsor stream.

3466
02:01:07,140 --> 02:01:08,340
Because, you know...

02:01:08,340 --> 02:01:08,820
Um...

3468
02:01:08,820 --> 02:01:10,840
There's a lot of like fun stuff to do there.

3469
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:11,820
And, um...

3470
02:01:11,820 --> 02:01:13,700
I try my best to make it fun for you guys.

3471
02:01:13,700 --> 02:01:14,220
And...

3472
02:01:14,220 --> 02:01:15,180
Um...

3473
02:01:15,180 --> 02:01:16,500
And, you know...

3474
02:01:16,500 --> 02:01:16,840
Um...

3475
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:18,040
Hang out with my dragoons.

3476
02:01:18,520 --> 02:01:19,040
So...

3477
02:01:19,580 --> 02:01:19,840
Um...

3478
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:22,200
I look forward to the rest of the week!

3479
02:01:22,380 --> 02:01:23,440
Tomorrow's collab, though.

3480
02:01:23,560 --> 02:01:25,840
Tomorrow is Mario Party with...

3481
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:26,200
Um...

3482
02:01:26,200 --> 02:01:27,260
I got invited to it.

3483
02:01:27,700 --> 02:01:28,220
Uh...

3484
02:01:28,220 --> 02:01:29,360
I think...

3485
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:29,620
Uh...

3486
02:01:29,620 --> 02:01:30,460
I got invited to it.

3487
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:31,480
And I was like, sure, no problem.

3488
02:01:32,040 --> 02:01:32,520
Um...

3489
02:01:32,520 --> 02:01:32,980
But...

3490
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:34,360
Tomorrow...

3491
02:01:34,360 --> 02:01:34,860
Um...

3492
02:01:34,860 --> 02:01:36,700
That one was also took a while to plan.

3493
02:01:37,200 --> 02:01:37,720
Um...

3494
02:01:37,720 --> 02:01:39,400
Because, um...

3495
02:01:39,400 --> 02:01:40,920
Zentrayo's going through a lot.

3496
02:01:41,580 --> 02:01:42,100
Um...

3497
02:01:42,100 --> 02:01:43,620
You know, over the last couple of weeks.

3498
02:01:43,620 --> 02:01:44,600
So...

3499
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:45,560
I literally like...

3500
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:46,620
Got notified...

3501
02:01:46,620 --> 02:01:47,920
About the...

3502
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:48,820
The...

3503
02:01:48,820 --> 02:01:49,260
Like...

3504
02:01:49,260 --> 02:01:49,720
Who...

3505
02:01:49,720 --> 02:01:51,280
Who I'm collabing with.

3506
02:01:51,580 --> 02:01:52,380
And like...

3507
02:01:52,380 --> 02:01:53,260
The time and date.

3508
02:01:53,840 --> 02:01:54,440
Like...

3509
02:01:54,440 --> 02:01:55,200
Like...

3510
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:55,860
Last night.

3511
02:01:56,280 --> 02:01:58,060
That's why I also couldn't put the schedule up.

3512
02:01:58,100 --> 02:01:58,520
Because like...

3513
02:01:58,520 --> 02:01:59,760
I was waiting for confirmation.

3514
02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:01,960
Um...

3515
02:02:01,960 --> 02:02:03,140
I was waiting for confirmation.

3516
02:02:03,780 --> 02:02:04,120
Uh...

3517
02:02:04,120 --> 02:02:04,480
For...

3518
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:04,680
Like...

3519
02:02:04,680 --> 02:02:05,660
Basically every day.

3520
02:02:05,680 --> 02:02:06,800
I had to wait for confirmation.

3521
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:07,260
Like...

3522
02:02:07,260 --> 02:02:07,820
Every...

3523
02:02:07,820 --> 02:02:09,460
All the streams for this week.

3524
02:02:09,460 --> 02:02:11,720
I was waiting for confirmation on stuff.

3525
02:02:13,140 --> 02:02:13,620
Um...

3526
02:02:13,620 --> 02:02:14,080
Yeah.

3527
02:02:14,080 --> 02:02:15,060
So...

3528
02:02:15,060 --> 02:02:15,520
Uh...

3529
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:17,260
Tomorrow will be Mario Party.

3530
02:02:17,580 --> 02:02:17,940
With...

3531
02:02:17,940 --> 02:02:19,180
Zentraya...

3532
02:02:19,180 --> 02:02:20,220
Billion...

3533
02:02:20,220 --> 02:02:20,740
And...

3534
02:02:20,740 --> 02:02:21,280
Mari Mari.

3535
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:21,980
So...

3536
02:02:21,980 --> 02:02:22,140
Yeah.

3537
02:02:22,620 --> 02:02:22,880
Uh...

3538
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:23,960
They invited me and I was like...

3539
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:24,220
Okay.

3540
02:02:25,120 --> 02:02:25,600
Sure.

3541
02:02:27,100 --> 02:02:27,580
Uh...

3542
02:02:27,580 --> 02:02:27,980
Um...

3543
02:02:27,980 --> 02:02:28,000
Um...

3544
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:28,160
But yeah.

3545
02:02:28,240 --> 02:02:29,100
So that's tomorrow.

3546
02:02:29,460 --> 02:02:30,360
And then...

3547
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:31,440
Wednesday...

3548
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:31,940
Tuesday.

3549
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:33,040
Thursday.

3550
02:02:33,620 --> 02:02:34,880
Thursday is two sponsors.

3551
02:02:35,180 --> 02:02:36,280
One is called...

3552
02:02:36,280 --> 02:02:36,720
Gold...

3553
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:38,420
What is it called?

3554
02:02:38,780 --> 02:02:39,260
Gold...

3555
02:02:39,260 --> 02:02:39,800
Gold...

3556
02:02:39,800 --> 02:02:40,920
Got me to say it correctly.

3557
02:02:41,780 --> 02:02:42,260
Gold...

3558
02:02:42,780 --> 02:02:43,260
Gold...

3559
02:02:47,420 --> 02:02:47,900
Uh...

3560
02:02:48,760 --> 02:02:50,240
Gold, gold, adventure, gold.

3561
02:02:50,460 --> 02:02:51,820
I forgot the third word.

3562
02:02:51,940 --> 02:02:53,560
I knew it was gold, gold, something gold.

3563
02:02:53,560 --> 02:02:55,580
Gold, gold, adventure gold.

3564
02:02:55,920 --> 02:02:56,600
On...

3565
02:02:56,600 --> 02:02:59,480
In the morning, in the afternoon, and in the evening.

3566
02:03:00,280 --> 02:03:01,520
It's uh...

3567
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:01,820
Vida...

3568
02:03:01,820 --> 02:03:02,380
Vida Ramen.

3569
02:03:03,260 --> 02:03:03,600
Vida...

3570
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:04,900
Vida...

3571
02:03:04,900 --> 02:03:05,240
Vida...

3572
02:03:05,240 --> 02:03:05,440
Vida...

3573
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:05,580
Vida...

3574
02:03:05,580 --> 02:03:05,860
Vida...

3575
02:03:05,860 --> 02:03:06,760
Vida Ramen...

3576
02:03:10,380 --> 02:03:11,060
Um...

3577
02:03:11,060 --> 02:03:12,220
Launch for the merch.

3578
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:13,280
With a special stream.

3579
02:03:13,820 --> 02:03:15,600
And then on...

3580
02:03:16,280 --> 02:03:16,960
Friday...

3581
02:03:17,560 --> 02:03:18,300
It's...

3582
02:03:18,300 --> 02:03:19,360
Special stream.

3583
02:03:19,740 --> 02:03:20,560
Special stream.

3584
02:03:20,940 --> 02:03:22,040
I didn't leak anything.

3585
02:03:22,700 --> 02:03:23,380
Uh...

3586
02:03:24,280 --> 02:03:24,800
Sponsor.

3587
02:03:25,080 --> 02:03:26,800
And then after that...

3588
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:27,780
It'll be...

3589
02:03:27,780 --> 02:03:28,140
Sorry.

3590
02:03:28,140 --> 02:03:29,660
I'm like malfunctioning right now.

3591
02:03:29,820 --> 02:03:31,700
I'm actually so brain fried today.

3592
02:03:32,280 --> 02:03:32,640
Um...

3593
02:03:32,640 --> 02:03:32,840
I don't...

3594
02:03:32,840 --> 02:03:33,240
I think...

3595
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:34,420
I feel like it's very noticeable.

3596
02:03:34,440 --> 02:03:36,100
Cause I'm stumbling a lot of my words.

3597
02:03:36,740 --> 02:03:37,260
Um...

3598
02:03:37,260 --> 02:03:39,440
And I'm saying a lot of fucking random shit today.

3599
02:03:39,700 --> 02:03:39,960
Like...

3600
02:03:40,320 --> 02:03:41,480
I'm all over the place.

3601
02:03:41,800 --> 02:03:43,100
My brain is so fried.

3602
02:03:43,100 --> 02:03:43,580
Like...

3603
02:03:43,580 --> 02:03:45,120
I'm so fried today.

3604
02:03:45,340 --> 02:03:45,400
Like...

3605
02:03:45,400 --> 02:03:47,060
Because of all the work that I have to do.

3606
02:03:47,540 --> 02:03:47,940
Uh...

3607
02:03:49,620 --> 02:03:50,540
Uh...

3608
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:53,720
Uh...

3609
02:03:53,720 --> 02:03:54,000
Uh...

3610
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:54,880
Uh...

3611
02:03:54,880 --> 02:03:57,000
My last brain cell is going...

3612
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:57,300
Hey...

3613
02:03:57,300 --> 02:03:59,600
It's vibrating so hard today.

3614
02:04:00,220 --> 02:04:00,620
Uh...

3615
02:04:01,620 --> 02:04:02,540
Uh...

3616
02:04:02,540 --> 02:04:03,280
Uh...

3617
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:16,440
Uh...

3618
02:04:16,440 --> 02:04:17,640
See, I can't even say words.

3619
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:19,920
I'm like, what's at chat?

3620
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:21,740
Chat's my thesaurus now.

3621
02:04:22,680 --> 02:04:25,700
Chat is my thesaurus and dictionary.

3622
02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:29,440
Um, I won't say like, I'm censoring myself.

3623
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:31,840
I'm restraining myself.

3624
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:32,860
No, what's that word?

3625
02:04:34,540 --> 02:04:35,060
Ah!

3626
02:04:35,060 --> 02:04:36,200
I'm less filtered.

3627
02:04:36,400 --> 02:04:36,660
Yes!

3628
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:38,540
I'm less filtered today.

3629
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:40,660
I'm a lot less filtered.

3630
02:04:40,760 --> 02:04:43,580
I am not thinking about what I'm saying, which is bad.

3631
02:04:43,580 --> 02:04:45,240
Which is very bad.

3632
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:52,320
But I, I don't have my, my mental filters are not on today.

3633
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:57,540
Um, so, that's why I'm so all over the place.

3634
02:04:58,060 --> 02:05:04,060
Um, um, um, but yes.

3635
02:05:04,300 --> 02:05:04,660
Anyway.

3636
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:07,460
Anyway, that's Thursday.

3637
02:05:07,860 --> 02:05:08,660
Or was that Friday?

3638
02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:10,480
Oh my gosh, I'm losing track of my days.

3639
02:05:10,660 --> 02:05:11,100
I'm ready.

3640
02:05:11,320 --> 02:05:12,520
So, that's Friday.

3641
02:05:12,680 --> 02:05:13,040
That's Friday.

3642
02:05:13,040 --> 02:05:16,220
And then after the special stream sponsor, it's Elden Ring.

3643
02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:19,040
And Saturday, it's the fake trigger sponsor.

3644
02:05:19,560 --> 02:05:25,280
So, and then if we do good, then Sunday is also another fake trigger sponsor.

3645
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:27,720
If we make it to the finals.

3646
02:05:28,060 --> 02:05:29,900
So, we'll see how it goes.

3647
02:05:30,180 --> 02:05:31,080
But anyway, guys.

3648
02:05:31,160 --> 02:05:33,100
I hope you guys all have a great time with me today.

3649
02:05:33,600 --> 02:05:34,900
As always, everybody.

3650
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,360
Stay hydrated.

3651
02:05:36,700 --> 02:05:37,160
Pause the check.

3652
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:39,020
Get up and around to get that blood flowing.

3653
02:05:39,020 --> 02:05:41,300
And if you, except for me, head to bed.

3654
02:05:41,420 --> 02:05:43,000
Cause, you deserve it.

3655
02:05:43,300 --> 02:05:47,160
Uh, I'll post the schedule up later today.

3656
02:05:47,660 --> 02:05:49,280
Cause I literally have it all written down.

3657
02:05:49,380 --> 02:05:50,440
Just didn't have the times on it.

3658
02:05:50,760 --> 02:05:51,340
So, but yeah.

3659
02:05:51,460 --> 02:05:52,600
I'll see you guys soon, everybody.

3660
02:05:52,980 --> 02:05:53,540
Or tomorrow.

3661
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:55,880
I'll see you guys later.

3662
02:05:56,260 --> 02:05:57,020
Uh, everyone.

3663
02:05:57,220 --> 02:05:57,800
As always, everybody.

3664
02:05:57,960 --> 02:05:58,600
Stay hydrated.

3665
02:05:58,800 --> 02:05:59,200
Pause the check.

3666
02:05:59,440 --> 02:06:01,040
Get up and around to get that blood flowing.

3667
02:06:01,140 --> 02:06:02,940
And if you, except for me, head to bed.

3668
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:04,120
Cause, you deserve it.

3669
02:06:04,120 --> 02:06:05,440
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3670
02:06:05,680 --> 02:06:06,460
Bye, guys.

3671
02:06:06,900 --> 02:06:07,380
Bye.
