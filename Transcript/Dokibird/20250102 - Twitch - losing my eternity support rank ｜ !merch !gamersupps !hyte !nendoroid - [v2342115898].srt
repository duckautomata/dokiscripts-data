00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,770
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,090
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:59,930
Guys, I know it's 11.44, but that means we have 15 minutes left before we can finish farming Valorant.

4
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,310
Guys, you don't understand!

5
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,070
We can still farm Valorant for free money, guys!

6
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,950
I have to go live before it's too late!

7
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,890
Guys, thank you for the Twitch Prime view!

8
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,110
Thank you, thank you!

9
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:28,850
Yes, if you guys didn't know, there's a special promotion where everybody's basically farming Valorant for...

10
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,070
Valorant!

11
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,810
Thank you for the gifted subs!

12
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,470
Doug, thank you for the 10 gifted subs!

13
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,650
Thank you, thank you!

14
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,610
No, I don't usually stream this late.

15
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,310
Guys, I was waiting.

16
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,270
Guys, I told you, I'm Plan Z, okay?

17
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,210
Guys, this is what I do.

18
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:55,870
I wait until anybody is free to play with me.

19
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,470
And usually, it's really late at night.

20
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,150
Please.

21
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,010
If I could, I'd play earlier.

22
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,590
This is literally the only time people play with me.

23
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,590
I told you guys, we all know this.

24
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,150
Bro, she's cooked.

25
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,670
Thank you for the 5 gifted subs!

26
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,350
Thank you, thank you!

27
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:29,650
Thank you for letting me farm Valorant one last time before it's all gone.

28
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,170
Thank you for the 5 gifted subs!

29
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,290
Thank you, thank you!

30
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,910
Thank you for the 10 gifted subs!

31
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,090
Thank you, thank you!

32
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:41,510
I just need non-degenerate friends.

33
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,450
That's fucked, guys.

34
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:49,230
Anyway, so we're going to be playing with... we actually ended up getting Mace in the end.

35
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,630
He woke up from his... he had a very long day.

36
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,030
I would know because I saw him on Gale's stream.

37
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,510
And apparently he had double blocks of scrims.

38
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,570
And I saw him on Gale's stream again.

39
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,410
And then he took a nap.

40
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,710
And now he's here.

41
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,230
So...

42
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,590
I was surprised he still wanted to play today.

43
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,870
Because I was...

44
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,050
I was just like, bro, it's okay.

45
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,030
Just fucking sleep.

46
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:17,870
You don't have to.

47
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,450
And then he just showed up.

48
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,350
And I was like, oh shit, okay.

49
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,490
And we're also grabbing Mac as our DPS third.

50
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,590
I literally told him, I was like, he's climbing.

51
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,070
Who would have thought?

52
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,550
He stopped his fucking Black Panther arc.

53
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,310
Mac stopped his goddamn Black Panther arc.

54
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,930
And now his Eternity peaked 160.

55
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,430
Who was right, guys?

56
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,990
Who the fuck was right?

57
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,810
He was like, no, my Black Panther is not a throw.

58
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:57,630
Oh yeah, now he stopped fucking playing Black Panther and he's finally climbing.

59
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,090
Mac was right.

60
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,670
Let him play.

61
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,290
Oh yeah.

62
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,250
Yeah.

63
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,430
Bro, I was like, I was like, are you serious?

64
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,910
Your Eternity...

65
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,170
He had like a...

66
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:19,690
He had a fucking 8 game win streak yesterday while fucking drunk.

67
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,290
But he only played Starlord.

68
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,250
He didn't play anything else.

69
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,210
And I'm just like, what was I?

70
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,550
Was I a fucking guinea pig for your sick experiments during that time?

71
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:42,350
So yes, he's now, he's now higher ranked than me.

72
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,610
He should not try out Storm.

73
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,750
Like, I swear to God.

74
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,750
Alright, so like I said, this is not like we're streaming until we get top 500.

75
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,250
It's literally we either lose Eternity or we get top 500.

76
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:56,970
There's no in between.

77
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:57,970
I'm not going to do a marathon.

78
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,790
I'm not going to do a long, a super fucking long stream today.

79
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,190
Because it's already super late for a lot of you guys.

80
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,390
And like, I'm so sorry.

81
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:12,950
I know like a lot of you guys, I didn't give you guys like a time of like when I was going to go live today.

82
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,750
Because even I didn't know when I was going to go live today.

83
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,330
So like, I'm so sorry.

84
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,510
For everybody that like waited in chat.

85
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,690
So like, I was going to stream regardless today.

86
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,710
Of like who I get.

87
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,010
Like, um.

88
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,990
So I really appreciate everybody waiting out.

89
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,510
To be like, I must.

90
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,690
I mean for enabling my addiction as well.

91
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,410
Like, I really appreciate it guys.

92
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,910
Like, for all of you guys for enabling this addiction.

93
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,430
Yeah, thank you for the 100 basic.

94
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,310
Thank you, thank you.

95
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,850
I've been kidnapped and I'm in Doki's basement.

96
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:47,850
Please help.

97
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,590
That is a fucking lie.

98
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,210
Because I was even like, no, you should sleep.

99
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,050
Because sleep is so much more important.

100
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,650
And it literally, the next message was like, I'm awake.

101
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,810
Let's fucking get it.

102
00:06:59,070 --> 00:06:59,290
Like.

103
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,520
I gave him an out.

104
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,200
I literally gave him the key.

105
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,720
I gave him the key to go out.

106
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,800
And he locked himself in the basement.

107
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,700
Like, that's his own fault.

108
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,820
Like, he had the free.

109
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,200
I gave him free will and he refused to take it.

110
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,200
To the end.

111
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,980
So right now we're just waiting for Max King to end.

112
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,920
And then we should be good to go.

113
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,340
We should be good to go.

114
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,640
I have no, I honestly have no idea.

115
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,440
Like, if the games are gonna be bad or good.

116
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,780
I don't know.

117
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,200
Because it's gonna be like an eternity three stack.

118
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,120
So like, I've never had that privilege before.

119
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:57,700
So like, I've never, I've never had the privilege to be in an eternity three stack.

120
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,900
So I could go, oh hey look, Dosiris in his own three stack.

121
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,500
Oh man, I hope, I hope we're not gonna play it.

122
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,980
Because I know he's playing with Beast Halo.

123
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,640
And I know Beast Halo is a fucking insane tank player.

124
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,240
So I hope he doesn't fire me.

125
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,440
I'm just a little, I'm just a little guy.

126
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,440
What the fuck?

127
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:13,780
Okay.

128
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,220
I'm just, I'm just a little guy.

129
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,140
BXB, thank you for the five gifted subs.

130
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,880
Thank you, thank you.

131
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,820
Sloppy, thank you for the five gifted subs.

132
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,040
Thank you for letting me farm.

133
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,120
Thank you for letting me farm Valorant for, I believe, ten more minutes until it's all over.

134
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,020
Oh shit, he's here.

135
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,000
Alright, let's go.

136
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,520
Alright, I'm a little scared though.

137
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,740
Who's being, who's the discord kitten?

138
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,620
Who could it be?

139
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,220
Alright, I'm just a little worried.

140
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,620
Just a little bit.

141
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:51,060
I have, I have no, I don't even know how long Q's are going to be too.

142
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,320
Are Q's bad in this ELO?

143
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,200
I hope they're not that bad.

144
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,220
I heard like some high, wait, how high rank is Meece's ulti count?

145
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,980
Okay, good, he lost it all.

146
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,460
That's fine.

147
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,580
That's, that means games might...

148
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,120
Okay, dick.

149
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,220
That means Q's will be faster.

150
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,280
It means Q's will be faster.

151
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,580
Guys, that's what I mean.

152
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:25,520
I don't want to wait, I don't want to wait like 20 minutes for a game.

153
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,320
I just, I just want to play.

154
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,540
Ducky, please.

155
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,560
I don't, I don't know what the average wait time is.

156
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,340
Oh, it's a minute.

157
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,520
Okay, that's nice.

158
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,900
It's only a minute and 20 seconds.

159
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,080
I saw like for some people.

160
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,660
For people who are too high ranked and they're too high ranked.

161
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,540
That their estimate time was just unknown.

162
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,840
Like, like you don't even know.

163
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,800
You just gotta sit there.

164
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,280
So, I don't, I don't want to, I don't want to deal with that.

165
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,060
Like, I don't know, I don't want to deal with unknown.

166
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,540
Nexy, thank you for the 10 gifted subs.

167
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,400
Thank you, thank you.

168
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,140
A star guy, thank you for the $10 donation.

169
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,260
Thank you, thank you.

170
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,400
Be honest, when was the last time you slept?

171
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,680
I actually woke up from a nap.

172
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,660
Like a three hour, two hour, two to three hours nap.

173
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,440
And I just slept a lot after the New Year's countdown.

174
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,280
I just like, after New Year's countdown, I did some, I did a little bit of work stuff.

175
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:34,080
And then I went to, I actually, for the first day one of, oh my god, this is a full eternity.

176
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,020
Oh my god, fucking, oh my god.

177
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,320
I knew I was gonna, I knew it.

178
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,120
I knew I was gonna play against that stack.

179
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,920
I fucking knew it.

180
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:51,140
Oh my god, I, bro, I fucking knew I was gonna play against this dude and use Halo.

181
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,800
I don't know who their third is.

182
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,480
I just know they're three stacking as well.

183
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,880
It is that stack.

184
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,980
I should have dodged.

185
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,920
I'm not even party leader.

186
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,560
Alright, guys.

187
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,180
Ban Bruce, oh yeah, we should ban Bruce better.

188
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,040
I don't want to play against the Hulk player.

189
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,120
Hella second, that's true.

190
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,340
That's true, he is a hella one trick.

191
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,300
Well, he's not a hella one trick.

192
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,380
His Hawkeye is actually insane too.

193
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:28,980
I remember, that's why I like, literally, I remember after the game where he was Hawkeye, he like, he added me.

194
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,200
And I was like, damn, your fucking Hawkeye is insane.

195
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,800
Of course, oh my god.

196
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,940
Of course, they banned Starlord.

197
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:45,240
I literally told Mace, I was like, yeah, Max is an insane Starlord player.

198
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,800
And then Mace was like, what do we do if he's banned?

199
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,480
And I was like, I don't fucking know, man.

200
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,980
I was like, I don't know, I hope it doesn't happen, I guess.

201
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:04,220
I was like, I don't know, his other characters, it's like 50-50.

202
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:09,200
His Starlord's fucking carry, like, his Starlord's fucking insane.

203
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,760
Alright.

204
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,980
Alright, we'll see how this goes.

205
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,780
If not, we just, I guess we dodge?

206
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,220
We dodge next time.

207
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,600
I can't believe it, of course.

208
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,480
Of course the first game, the first game this happens.

209
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,500
It's alright, I believe in his magic.

210
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,480
I believe.

211
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:45,940
I believe.

212
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,700
Alright, just keep Mace alive.

213
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,880
Keep Mace alive, that's been the plan, that will always be the plan.

214
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,780
I believe.

215
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,840
Why ban Iron Fist?

216
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,840
Maybe this guy plays Iron Fist, I'm pretty sure.

217
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,180
Yeah?

218
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:05,980
Oh my god.

219
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,980
I don't know if my voice chat is broken.

220
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,460
Wait,

221
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,920
his orb is gone because of it.

222
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,280
I don't know if my VC is broken, because it's always there.

223
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,300
Oh, his Hawkeye is insane though.

224
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,390
Oh my god.

225
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:40,870
Okay, I have to...

226
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,350
There's a Hawkeye to the left.

227
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,990
Oh my god, I don't know.

228
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,950
I don't know if my VC is working!

229
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,410
Oh, I should have warmed up.

230
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,830
This being the first game is not it for me.

231
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,110
I...

232
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,830
Oh my god.

233
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,750
This being the first game, oh my god.

234
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,850
No, this is insane on Hawkeye.

235
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,510
I have ult here.

236
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,090
Mantis ult first?

237
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,010
Is it possible?

238
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,430
There's a Hawkeye there, Hawkeye's half.

239
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,590
Hawkeye's one, Hawkeye's one.

240
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,830
There's a Magneto on her, Wolverine.

241
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:33,250
Alright, nice.

242
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,290
Alright, it's working!

243
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,370
The VC is working!

244
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:40,110
Go!

245
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:49,230
Oh, I need heals, I need heals Mantis.

246
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,650
I need...

247
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,990
Oh my god, guys.

248
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:53,950
I'm scared.

249
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,890
I'm so scared of this Hawkeye.

250
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,130
This Hawkeye's actually insane.

251
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,470
Oh yeah, he's actually his teammate too.

252
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,150
Run!

253
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:01,070
Run!

254
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,890
Oh, I can ult this here.

255
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:05,010
Malting.

256
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,370
Don't peek it though, you're not gonna survive.

257
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,050
Oh my god!

258
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,350
There's so many things on my screen!

259
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,650
We can just die on point.

260
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,290
Alright.

261
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,570
Oh my god, these games are so much harder.

262
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:35,930
I miss my GM lobbies.

263
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,750
I miss my GM lobbies!

264
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,950
Oh my god, I hate these lobbies!

265
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,250
I can't fucking peek anything!

266
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,750
Everybody get in!

267
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,390
Oh my god!

268
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,650
I'm fucking a baby!

269
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,610
A fucking baby!

270
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,630
The price I pay.

271
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,250
I can't see you, Wolverine.

272
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,850
Oh, it doesn't matter, I die.

273
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,190
I die!

274
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,490
We're down, we're down too.

275
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,310
Alright.

276
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,650
I miss it.

277
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:25,610
Yes, I realize how good we had it.

278
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,670
Being a little...

279
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,790
A little baby.

280
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:38,210
Oh my god.

281
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,620
There's his web pick!

282
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,920
Nice.

283
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:54,750
That's huge!

284
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:55,250
That's a huge ult!

285
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,030
I'm ulting, I'm ulting.

286
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,520
Nice.

287
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,680
I'm damage boosting it.

288
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,300
Luna,

289
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:16,680
Luna!

290
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,400
Oh my god!

291
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,280
That's fun!

292
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,800
We're so healthy!

293
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,500
Oh my god!

294
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,980
Oh, I'm in the...

295
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,520
Big boy lobbies.

296
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,540
This is so...

297
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,360
I'm so stressed out.

298
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,460
I'm ready.

299
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,300
I'm so stressed out already.

300
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,840
Guys, I didn't even warm up.

301
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,960
I just went straight into it.

302
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,020
I was like, alright, I'll wait for my nap.

303
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,840
Just walked my dog.

304
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,540
And I guess it's time to stream and play Marble Rivals!

305
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,420
That's my first game!

306
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,020
That's my first game!

307
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,920
Turkey is a big boy now.

308
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,580
I wanna be back at my baby table.

309
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:08,840
I don't...

310
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,440
Oh my god, I'm so stressed out.

311
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,420
I remember our good times.

312
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,800
When I was a baby in the group.

313
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,920
This is fun.

314
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:22,900
Alright.

315
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,700
The good times.

316
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,440
The good times back then.

317
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,560
Oh my god, I can't even like...

318
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,060
I can't even like, hesitate at all.

319
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,180
Like, it's just...

320
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:39,800
Frozen?

321
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:39,980
Frozen?

322
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,320
I'm on Venom.

323
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,280
Venom low, Venom low!

324
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,440
Venom one!

325
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,790
Oh my god.

326
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,130
Oh my god, I need heals, Mantis, why don't you?

327
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,270
Oh no!

328
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:01,650
Mantis!

329
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,050
I just needed a little bit of heals!

330
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,510
You're down a healer.

331
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,490
I just...

332
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:11,230
I just...

333
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,510
Oh, didn't she just watch?

334
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:17,610
She just watched it all happen!

335
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:18,730
Oh!

336
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,310
Just a fucking baby!

337
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,390
Oh my god.

338
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:33,050
It's okay, we just...

339
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,410
Wait, there's somebody on my Magneto.

340
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:36,610
I think...

341
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,970
I think BC is broken.

342
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,970
No, BC...

343
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:41,690
Okay.

344
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:41,810
Okay.

345
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:43,590
Here we go.

346
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,790
That's fine.

347
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,310
Yeah, I'm pretty sure BC is broken.

348
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,410
I'm so fucking sure.

349
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,310
Woo!

350
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,070
I wish the BC was...

351
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:05,770
better.

352
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:08,330
Alright.

353
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,250
That's fine.

354
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:11,690
That's fine.

355
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,450
That's fine.

356
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,590
We're all alive.

357
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,810
Let's dance!

358
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:21,330
Oh, don't roll, don't roll.

359
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,510
Oh, that's fine.

360
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:30,010
I'm hiding behind that and I'm definitely gonna die.

361
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:38,030
I don't understand why BC like breaks on and off all the time.

362
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,690
It's actually like...

363
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:40,990
It's so annoying.

364
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,650
It's so fucking annoying when that happens.

365
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,170
I know it's broken cause like Mace always talks.

366
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,470
Oh my god.

367
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,650
Oh my god.

368
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,590
You're so healthy.

369
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,930
You're so fucking healthy.

370
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,790
You're so healthy.

371
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,090
You're so...

372
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,190
Oh, Venom's...

373
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:08,750
Venom, please.

374
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:11,590
Okay.

375
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,590
That's fine.

376
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,920
That's fine, he's alive.

377
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,540
You don't need no voice comms.

378
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,500
What the fuck is voice comms for anyway?

379
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,000
Voice comms are for pussies.

380
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,580
If you wanna be a real gamer, you win without talking.

381
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,300
Oh, shit.

382
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,740
I was so close.

383
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:48,860
I wish I had voice comms to tell them that there was a mantis on me.

384
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,800
There was a cylorg on me.

385
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm like, no, I wish I could yell for help.

386
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,760
I'm not even gonna say GG.

387
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,100
We take those though.

388
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,240
We fucking take those.

389
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,520
Oh my god, that's fine.

390
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,300
I'm okay with taking that.

391
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,560
That was... Yay!

392
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,080
Clap for help then.

393
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,460
Guys, I think...

394
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,360
Yeah, I'm happy we...

395
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,620
I'm happy we...

396
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,680
We were able to live for a bit.

397
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:39,120
We might have 5 deaths, but I blame the lack of voice comms.

398
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:43,980
I blame voice comms breaking in the end.

399
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,060
Also, I definitely... Guys, I have like a million excuses and I'm ready.

400
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,160
I'm trying to figure out...

401
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,860
Maybe controls... Wait, what did I put for...

402
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,400
I need healing.

403
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:58,500
Because I know there's no crouch walk, so there's no crouching.

404
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,720
What is it?

405
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,240
What did I put?

406
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,200
Okay, left control.

407
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,480
Alright, left control.

408
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,600
It's like 120.

409
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,560
No, it goes on and off.

410
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:14,700
Like, I don't... Sometimes it just... It's just like in between rounds that it breaks sometimes.

411
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,500
Like, the game is like almost perfect.

412
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,060
It's actually almost perfect.

413
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,020
It's literally... It just breaks the voice comms.

414
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,800
It's like the worst thing they couldn't... It's just the worst thing ever.

415
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,040
That's really it.

416
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,760
They were so close to perfection.

417
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:30,600
Yeah.

418
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,480
I don't know.

419
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,200
It's crazy.

420
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,560
Like, nothing... Like, everything else is okay.

421
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,520
I don't understand.

422
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:41,040
Everything else is like very... It's like...

423
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:47,140
Well, I won't say very well optimized because the whole, like, you do more damage if you have more frames is a little fucked up.

424
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,520
Like, you know, just a little bit fucked up.

425
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,340
Like, you... It's literally like...

426
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,640
Spec diff, if you guys didn't see about it.

427
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,880
Like, the less FPS you have, the less damage you do.

428
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,000
And then the mouse... The built-in mouse acceleration is pretty fucking crazy.

429
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:07,140
And the fact that you can't turn it off is a little weird.

430
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,740
It's like...

431
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,080
Who the fuck plays with mouses?

432
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,600
Who the fuck competitively-wise play with mouse acceleration?

433
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,160
And then...

434
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,180
Yeah, the built-in mouse acceleration is pretty...

435
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,820
It's pretty messed up.

436
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,880
And then...

437
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,620
And other than that, everything else is great.

438
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,160
Like...

439
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:34,400
I feel like they actually ban cheaters every day.

440
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,320
Because I've been getting...

441
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,180
You know, I get like, thank you for reporting!

442
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,260
Thank you for reporting!

443
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,400
And stuff like that.

444
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:45,420
So they actually actively ban hackers and DDoS'ers and everything.

445
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:51,360
No, the command for mouse acceleration, they patched it.

446
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:55,600
So you can't do the config file with turning off mouse accel anymore.

447
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,680
They patched it up in two days.

448
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,880
I don't know why they patched it.

449
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:02,760
I guess they don't like the fact that you're editing the game files.

450
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,920
Which makes sense, because a lot of devs don't like that.

451
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,280
Like editing the game files itself.

452
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:12,900
So I'm not that surprised that they edited that out.

453
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,400
Still a little cringe, yeah.

454
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,710
Oh, we don't get them again!

455
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,490
I thought we would get them.

456
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:31,120
I shine in darkness.

457
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:36,720
Yeah, but if it's not there now, they might as well let us have the config.

458
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,620
Yeah, but what's the point of patching it if you're gonna bring it back anyway?

459
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:47,600
You might as well put it... I don't understand though, because they don't want to...

460
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,040
They don't want to have people editing the game files.

461
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,120
But still, if you're gonna bring it, bring it.

462
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,320
Why not bring it back?

463
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:57,860
Bring it now.

464
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,180
You know I'm the best DPS player in NA, right?

465
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,400
Okay.

466
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,460
Sure.

467
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:09,760
Um...

468
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,060
Hello?

469
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,640
Are they bad, huh?

470
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,580
Cause like, Mac can play...

471
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,760
Oh yeah, oh man, hello.

472
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,220
I was gonna say, Mac's really good at hello.

473
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,420
Wait, wait, he is playing.

474
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,380
Oh, shit.

475
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:24,760
Okay.

476
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,000
He's clearly joking, right?

477
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,080
Okay.

478
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,520
Okay.

479
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,340
Alright.

480
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:36,400
I've seen him play DPS in plat.

481
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,380
Oh no, not even plat in silver.

482
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,060
So like...

483
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,200
I don't know.

484
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,480
We'll see today.

485
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,160
We'll see.

486
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:56,040
Oh yeah, if my mods are alive right now, can you edit in my squad with Mace and Mac?

487
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,620
Yeah, like, that's why I don't use any... I really...

488
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:09,000
I know there's like a lot of really funny mods for Marble Rivals, but I'm so scared of getting banned for using them.

489
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,080
So like...

490
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,100
Or like get suspended or something.

491
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,720
So, that's why I don't use any...

492
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,840
I don't use any of the mods.

493
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:21,460
I know there's like... I talked about it yesterday, but I really wanted...

494
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:25,640
No, two days ago, but I really wanted to... Oh my god, I really...

495
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,180
Oh my god, I'm gonna watch on my chair.

496
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,960
Anyway, um...

497
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,820
Yo, what?

498
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,780
As I was saying, um...

499
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,260
Where was...

500
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:48,980
I really wanna mod the cart to Thomas the Tank Engine, but I'm scared of getting suspended for it.

501
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,850
We're on their helicopter.

502
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:55,510
Cool.

503
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,910
I dropped.

504
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:58,770
I'm sorry.

505
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:07,050
I like jumped through and dropped instantly.

506
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:11,930
Put magic on me, please.

507
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,350
I'm sorry.

508
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,770
That was actually a throw.

509
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,430
I like jumped through the portal.

510
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,110
Match is frozen.

511
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,720
That was so unlucky.

512
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,380
Shit, I'm so sad.

513
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,440
I'm so sad.

514
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,620
I can't believe it.

515
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,700
I was like, no, I could've been behind him.

516
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,020
Oh, I'm just gonna die.

517
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,220
I tripped.

518
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,020
I fucking tripped.

519
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:04,140
Yeah, no, there's some fucking crazy mods out there.

520
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,220
I need to put this on a tank.

521
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,440
Okay, don't worry, tank.

522
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,380
Mace, you don't get this privilege anymore.

523
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,520
You're not tank anymore.

524
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,040
Where's our other tank?

525
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,000
Oh, there he is.

526
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,180
I was like, where did he go?

527
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,020
I hope Mack is okay with not being healing.

528
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:35,880
Alright.

529
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,120
Of course, the map is changing.

530
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,280
Oh, we need help back here.

531
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:49,760
God.

532
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,160
Oh, no.

533
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,700
Oh, my God.

534
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,400
Yeah, we got hooked.

535
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,180
I don't think my voice chat is working.

536
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,000
Oh, my God, I might have to actually restart my game.

537
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,760
That was so sad.

538
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:18,070
Oh, my God, that was so sad, guys.

539
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,590
That was so unlucky.

540
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:22,730
Of course, I get caught.

541
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:27,370
Oh, my God.

542
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,850
Don't worry, you're all alive.

543
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,090
I'm dancing.

544
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,990
I'm dancing.

545
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:35,870
One second left.

546
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:41,190
I have magic on me.

547
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:46,650
I have no idea if it's working, but like, I'm still gonna come regardless.

548
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,250
Or they're ignoring me.

549
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:49,810
It's fine.

550
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,090
I'm used to it.

551
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:55,150
I'm so used to being ignored.

552
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,130
That's okay.

553
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,890
I hate it when that happens, though.

554
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,250
Oh, my God.

555
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:07,030
It's so frustrating, because I might actually have to restart.

556
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:12,550
I might actually have to restart my game, because I thought, sometimes you don't have to, and it just fixes itself.

557
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:15,130
But sometimes, it's just like, you know, fuck you, I guess.

558
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,470
Like, the game's just like, whatever.

559
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,710
Alright, let's hope our- Oh!

560
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:23,230
Oh!

561
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:23,930
Nice!

562
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:24,390
Alright.

563
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:27,770
Thank God, I was gonna be a little worried there.

564
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:34,730
Sometimes, we go a little bit too fast, though, and...

565
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:37,910
That's fine.

566
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,330
Wait, what?

567
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,890
What do you mean, control lost?

568
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:48,390
Alright.

569
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,270
That's fine.

570
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,890
We're so healthy.

571
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,090
We're so healthy.

572
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,200
We're so healthy.

573
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,260
We were just fucked over, because of the map change, earlier.

574
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,440
That's fine.

575
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,640
Oh, portal behind!

576
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,140
Portal behind!

577
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:09,200
Portal behind!

578
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,750
We're so...

579
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,230
We're so healthy.

580
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,250
Alright!

581
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:24,890
Oh!

582
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,170
Stop!

583
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,530
Oh, here we go!

584
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:30,730
I'm fucking dancing!

585
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,190
Oh, they have Strangelord here!

586
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:35,590
Oh!

587
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,330
And then I fucking fly away, I guess.

588
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,310
Oh.

589
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,290
Oh.

590
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,320
Oh.

591
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,720
Oh, there it is!

592
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,720
There it is!

593
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,340
Oh, you're alive!

594
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,680
Oh my God!

595
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,600
No sleeping for you!

596
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:04,900
Hahaha!

597
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:04,940
Oh my God!

598
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,100
I mean, you're doing alright.

599
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,740
I'd be better, but it's okay.

600
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,620
Oh, damn!

601
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,440
Mack, you did a great job.

602
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,560
You know, you're a mean person.

603
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,360
You know, that's strange.

604
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,720
Oh, my music is not.

605
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,740
It's not working.

606
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,680
You're bringing the team morale down!

607
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:30,940
No, no.

608
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,760
You're going crazy.

609
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,080
You're going crazy.

610
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,980
Oh my God, am I really, bro?

611
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,120
Oh my God.

612
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,300
Yeah, it's definitely not working.

613
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,120
I hate this.

614
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,820
It always happens to me.

615
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,020
Hello?

616
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:50,740
Hello?

617
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,020
Is it working now?

618
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,340
Hello?

619
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,240
Oh my God, he lied.

620
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,200
Alright, we TP.

621
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,960
Yeah, TP, TP, TP.

622
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:00,520
They don't have TP.

623
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:01,620
Hello?

624
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,020
Hello?

625
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,700
He fucking lied.

626
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:04,740
Hahaha!

627
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,400
There's no apply settings, guys!

628
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,560
There's no apply settings for mics!

629
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,440
He lied.

630
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,060
He fucking lied to me.

631
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,020
I was gonna be so happy.

632
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,860
I was like, oh my God, I can't wait to be able to talk to my teammates.

633
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,880
Woo!

634
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,610
Standing in a line.

635
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:32,790
Standing in a line.

636
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,750
Standing in a line so I can...

637
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,390
Oh my God!

638
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:42,910
Oh!

639
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,690
Oh, that's two kills.

640
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,310
Alright, I'm coming back.

641
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,310
I'm not allowed to yap.

642
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:52,550
Yapping is bad.

643
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,110
I'm gonna come in with Luna ult.

644
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,270
I'm coming in!

645
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:58,710
I'm coming in!

646
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,310
There we go, I made it.

647
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,090
I made it, everybody.

648
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:05,010
We keep dancing.

649
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,290
We stop dancing.

650
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:15,310
Oh my God, I'm so scared.

651
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,890
There's so many things going on my screen.

652
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,590
Which one's real?

653
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:25,750
Oh!

654
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,010
Oh, please.

655
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,710
Oh my God, I'm so scared.

656
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:34,570
I'm so scared.

657
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,970
All the map is moving!

658
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,730
Like, the map is moving!

659
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,890
Jesus Christ.

660
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:49,650
Oh my God, I hate this map so much.

661
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:51,550
Winner one, winner one.

662
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:53,170
I hate this map.

663
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,390
I actually hate this map.

664
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,120
Oh my God.

665
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,860
That's fine, that's fine.

666
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,720
We're so healthy.

667
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,620
Oh, dinosaur!

668
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,340
Alright.

669
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,900
Oh, okay.

670
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,760
That's fine.

671
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,960
We're still contesting.

672
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,540
We're still alive and very, very healthy.

673
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,580
Alright, except for that guy.

674
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:30,840
Oh my God.

675
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:32,560
It's fine.

676
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,500
We're so healthy.

677
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:36,320
We're still contesting.

678
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,160
No, legitimately, I hate this map.

679
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,740
This map moves way too fucking much.

680
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:48,240
Like, I don't even know where to position because of this map.

681
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,020
Because it changes all the time.

682
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,220
Oh, Mac, let me give you a word.

683
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,880
You can't hear me, but like, I hope you understand.

684
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,220
I hope you understand.

685
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,040
I hope... Ah!

686
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,160
No!

687
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,070
Not...

688
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:14,530
No!

689
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,630
Okay.

690
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,950
That's fine.

691
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,190
That's fine.

692
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,990
That's okay.

693
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,390
We're okay.

694
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:42,490
We're okay.

695
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,090
Alright.

696
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,290
That's fine.

697
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:49,830
Clap.

698
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:50,450
Clap.

699
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:51,090
Clap.

700
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:51,730
Clap.

701
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:52,350
Clap.

702
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,930
You are taking so much damage.

703
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:57,610
Clap.

704
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,950
Oh my God.

705
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,860
Nice.

706
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:08,620
That's huge!

707
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,140
That's huge!

708
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,780
That's so huge!

709
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,540
Please!

710
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,100
Focus tanks!

711
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:20,740
Nice.

712
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,260
Alright.

713
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,620
That was a really good ult, too.

714
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:35,580
I straight pathfigured their ult, but it worked!

715
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,100
That's crazy!

716
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:45,340
Oh, I thought I could get the cheeky freeze.

717
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:49,340
Oh, that's awkward.

718
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,340
That's actually...

719
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,340
That's really awkward.

720
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,040
How did that happen, guys?

721
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,560
That's so...

722
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:08,320
I don't know how that happened.

723
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,120
That's definitely very awkward.

724
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:18,060
The map's changing!

725
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,380
Please!

726
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,380
Please Magneto!

727
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,480
We

728
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,180
did it!

729
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,160
You guys did amazing.

730
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,960
Oh my God.

731
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,260
Oh my God, thank God!

732
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,140
I hate the map change.

733
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:56,080
This is actually gonna fucking... I'm gonna...

734
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:01,640
I'm gonna fucking blow up and I have to see this map change for a fifth time.

735
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,480
I'm gonna explode.

736
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,040
I'm gonna explode.

737
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:07,800
Okay.

738
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:12,500
Oh my God, where is...

739
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,060
Oh my God, he's not even on my friends list.

740
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,280
I can't fucking talk to him.

741
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,540
I can't even...

742
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,220
Okay, I gotta fix... Wait.

743
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,240
I fix... I fix VC.

744
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:27,220
I restart game and fix VC.

745
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,840
Alright, I'm gonna restart my game.

746
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,340
I gotta restart.

747
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,260
Oh my God.

748
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,220
Alright, let's see if it fixes.

749
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,180
Guys, no, I don't...

750
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,340
Guys, we're just playing.

751
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:44,920
Each game is a new game, a new life.

752
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,100
Guys, each game is new.

753
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:50,840
Guys, I don't wanna... I don't wanna go in there super confident and everything.

754
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,760
I don't wanna...

755
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,960
I don't wanna...

756
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:03,620
I don't wanna go in there super fucking confident and like, I'll be like, yeah, I'm totally gonna get top 500 everybody.

757
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,300
Yeah, it's totally gonna happen.

758
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:11,160
Yeah, no, the in-game voice chat keeps breaking for me.

759
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,160
It will work for like...

760
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,320
It's like on and off sometimes.

761
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,600
Also, Adam, thank you for the five gift subs.

762
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,140
Thank you, thank you.

763
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,940
And Rom, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

764
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:23,640
Thank you, thank you.

765
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,780
I really appreciate it.

766
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,040
No, I don't have... There's no mute button.

767
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:31,940
The Marvel Rivals VC doesn't have a mute button.

768
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:35,180
So, like, it's mostly... It's literally just...

769
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,140
It just breaks.

770
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:36,900
It's just...

771
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,220
It's just... It's like that.

772
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:39,880
How many points?

773
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,540
The cutoff is 120.

774
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:46,820
But I don't wanna be exactly 120, cause I would just lose it, like, the next day.

775
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,280
Like, I just...

776
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,360
I'll just lose it the next day.

777
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,680
I don't want that.

778
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:53,700
Alright.

779
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,700
Oh, it should be...

780
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,240
Alright.

781
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,060
Wait, why is my thing muted?

782
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,140
Wait, it is.

783
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,480
Okay, enable voice chat.

784
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:05,840
Hello?

785
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,400
Hello, hello?

786
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,680
Okay, I'll just think they're ignoring me.

787
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,040
I...

788
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:20,860
That's fine.

789
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,820
That's alright.

790
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,880
It's okay.

791
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,980
Hello, hello?

792
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,520
Okay, that's fine.

793
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,280
That's okay.

794
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,640
We don't wanna listen to my voice anyway in-game.

795
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:40,960
We don't...

796
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,540
Oh,

797
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:46,860
no.

798
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,300
I give up.

799
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,720
I give up.

800
00:42:53,780 --> 00:43:01,220
If it all fails, I guess we could go into a Discord VC, I guess.

801
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,760
I guess.

802
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,420
I don't wanna talk with open mic, guys.

803
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,560
Cause then, like, I have to...

804
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,900
Then they'll hear me scream at people.

805
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,540
I don't...

806
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:17,820
If I go open mic, they're just gonna hear me...

807
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,260
They're just gonna think I'm crazy.

808
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,720
And, like, I don't... Guys, I already have an addiction.

809
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,020
I don't need more problems.

810
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:27,560
I don't need more problems in my life.

811
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:35,300
Yeah, but I don't want my teammates to know that.

812
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:38,380
Like, you guys know that cause this is a safe space.

813
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,220
You guys enabled me to do all this.

814
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,220
But, like, they're just here.

815
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,200
I guess I'll...

816
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,600
I'll change the chat mic thing.

817
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,680
Hello, hello?

818
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,280
Testing?

819
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,460
It's fine.

820
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,220
It's fine.

821
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,080
I just pushed to talk.

822
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,400
I just pushed to talk.

823
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,320
Well, I'm not using it on Discord.

824
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,800
I'm using it, like, here.

825
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,420
Like, in game.

826
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:19,930
It's okay.

827
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:22,050
What is my push to talk?

828
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:24,890
Well, I changed my push to talk to numerous other buttons.

829
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:30,450
I tried, like, one of my letter keys, but it's not working.

830
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:33,350
And then, I usually use, like, mouse button 5.

831
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:34,890
Hello?

832
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:37,310
Hello?

833
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:40,930
You can see it go up and down, though.

834
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:42,010
That's the thing.

835
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:45,130
Try a little bit.

836
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:46,810
Okay.

837
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:48,970
I'll try a little bit of open mic.

838
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:52,350
No, last time I did open mic and then I did it back.

839
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,450
And then, uh...

840
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:58,880
Hello?

841
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,480
Hello?

842
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:03,050
Hello?

843
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:04,910
Can you hear me?

844
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:09,570
Okay, nothing works.

845
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:12,450
I guess, fuck me, I guess.

846
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:15,970
No.

847
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:20,430
It's okay.

848
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:21,830
I'm clumsy.

849
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:24,410
I know my place in the world.

850
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,060
I know my place.

851
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,320
No, I... Why would I get reported because...

852
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:34,360
Woman.

853
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:42,320
Why the fuck would I get voice back?

854
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,310
Female talking in my game.

855
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,280
Get reported.

856
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:49,540
Like, like, female.

857
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,940
Marvel Rivals doesn't want me to get top 500.

858
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,860
No, I can, I can, I can do this.

859
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,460
Is that top 500?

860
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:03,740
Or, like, if I'm forced to not be able to talk, that's fine.

861
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,660
That's literally how I played.

862
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:09,160
I literally only started talking in game two days ago because I was desperate.

863
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,520
I was fucking desperate to win at that point.

864
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:17,660
I was like, if it requires me to communicate with my teammates, I guess I'll do it.

865
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:21,600
I guess I'll fucking talk.

866
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,200
Everybody's one above all.

867
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,120
Fucking nerds.

868
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:32,660
You got, that's true, you gotta be top 500 to speak.

869
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:42,460
I didn't for Overwatch until, like, people started being, people started being weird.

870
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,200
Why Iron Fist?

871
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,360
Is there an Iron Fist player?

872
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:51,200
I'll do it.

873
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,180
I believe in him.

874
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:53,380
Hmm.

875
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,460
Oh no.

876
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:57,460
Fuck.

877
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,320
I spilled a little bit of my drink.

878
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:00,580
Oops.

879
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:05,440
Alright.

880
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,820
Oh no, but what if they have a Hulk player?

881
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,900
What if they have a Hulk player?

882
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:14,440
I'm scared.

883
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,360
I'll talk in game when I'm required to.

884
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:27,080
For now, if I, if I have a chance to not talk in game, I will not talk in game.

885
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:36,340
I only speak when I'm, when I want to win.

886
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,200
I do not speak for anything else.

887
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,700
Cause that, cause then it gets a little too personal.

888
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:50,360
This is a business relationship right now.

889
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:01,170
Solo heroes.

890
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:03,170
I believe in us.

891
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:06,050
Alright.

892
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:11,270
It's okay.

893
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,410
We might have...

894
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:14,510
It's alright.

895
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:18,990
We're in a, we're in a tourney, one above our lobby.

896
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:19,810
That's alright.

897
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:23,970
That's alright.

898
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:27,150
Crazy that in these lobbies, we still...

899
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:28,190
Oh, there we go.

900
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:28,810
That's right.

901
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:32,090
Suck up your fucking ego and heal like the kitten you are.

902
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:38,630
Alright, there you go.

903
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:43,710
Toxic, holy fuck.

904
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:53,530
This is damn, this is why you don't have open mic.

905
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:55,530
Would be crazy.

906
00:48:56,010 --> 00:48:57,070
Oh, fuck.

907
00:48:57,210 --> 00:48:58,010
They have Hulk.

908
00:48:58,790 --> 00:48:59,730
That fuck.

909
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:05,450
Who the fuck did that?

910
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:11,070
Oh my god.

911
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:12,450
I'll get him.

912
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:18,890
Oh my god.

913
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:21,390
Like, I don't know what you guys...

914
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:22,110
Wait, Strange is low.

915
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:28,970
Nice.

916
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:36,430
I can't see you, man.

917
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:39,830
Oh.

918
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:42,110
There's a...

919
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:43,150
Strange is low, Strange is low.

920
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:46,370
Did he just open a portal?

921
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:46,870
Yeah.

922
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:50,850
Oh, he opened a portal.

923
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:54,910
We need a Mantis ult first.

924
00:49:57,510 --> 00:50:01,650
I don't know if it's working, but like, I saw myself pop up on screen.

925
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:07,370
It's fine.

926
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:10,430
I wasted the ice, but it's so fine.

927
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:12,790
We don't need it.

928
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:13,650
Oh, left side, left side, left side.

929
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:14,050
Ironman.

930
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:17,790
Oh my god.

931
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:20,490
That is...

932
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:21,010
We're even.

933
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:24,710
Wait, left side.

934
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:25,470
Behind me, Syla.

935
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:29,350
I'm gonna have to ult.

936
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:34,850
There's a Hulk behind us.

937
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:35,470
Low, low, low.

938
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:36,410
Hulk is one.

939
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:49,880
The only Mantis heals.

940
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,160
Oh my god.

941
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,320
Wait, it's winnable.

942
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,360
Oh, it's winnable, it's winnable.

943
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:06,360
It's no longer winnable.

944
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,660
It's totally winnable.

945
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,420
Okay, there's a Hulk on me, I'm scared.

946
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,020
Oh shit, there's a giant Hulk.

947
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,320
He's low, he's low.

948
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:23,820
Hulk is one.

949
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,060
Oh my god.

950
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,340
Alright, yeah, I saw the Hulk run at me and I knew it was over.

951
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,320
I knew, I knew it was so over.

952
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:47,130
That Syla ult is strange.

953
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:53,390
Wait, right side, Syla?

954
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:02,430
I'm killing Ironman.

955
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:03,950
Oh my god.

956
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:05,830
Strange, uh, Hulk is one.

957
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:06,350
Hulk is one.

958
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:11,510
Oh my god.

959
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:14,670
We're down like three.

960
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:22,530
Alright.

961
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:24,850
Oh.

962
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:29,130
This is a little scary here.

963
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:39,190
That's fine, everything is so a-okay.

964
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:40,490
Oh, that's a good pick, nice pick.

965
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:45,020
Got you.

966
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,860
We're so healthy, guys.

967
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,400
I'm dancing.

968
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:53,400
Hulk, Hulk, Hulk.

969
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:58,020
Oh, guess not.

970
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,040
Oh yeah, this is a good game.

971
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:08,400
They should have Syla ult, they might Syla ult this.

972
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,080
I don't have a support ult for it.

973
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:17,360
Oh my god, I'm trying to give you- I'm trying to run out.

974
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,520
Oh my god.

975
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:31,040
Mantis, you lived for so long.

976
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:36,880
Boop.

977
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:40,760
Kill this- No, he killed more than just me.

978
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,240
That was such a great- That was such a good Iron Man ult too.

979
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:48,020
This is why we banned Bruce Banner.

980
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,560
This is exactly why.

981
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,020
Yeah, we just had nothing.

982
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,900
We literally had no ults for it.

983
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,500
Alright, it's time.

984
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,000
It's time.

985
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:04,940
It's time.

986
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:08,180
Do we have- Do we have an Iron Man player?

987
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,480
We-

988
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:22,780
Alright, yeah.

989
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,320
We don't need an Iron Man.

990
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,360
That's right.

991
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:30,420
We don't need one.

992
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:33,420
We don't need a fucking Hulk crutch.

993
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:38,220
Only pussies use Bruce Banner and Iron Man.

994
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:40,520
Because they can't climb like real men.

995
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,000
That's fucking right.

996
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,060
That's what I said.

997
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:56,020
Oh, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk behind us!

998
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:58,560
Okay, I might be dead.

999
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:06,520
Oh my god, he brought the Hulk over and I- Oh my god.

1000
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,680
I'm like, yeah.

1001
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:22,200
I just see my- Gets the Hulk in my face and I'm like, yeah.

1002
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:24,800
I'm fucking- It's over for me.

1003
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:31,850
God, you guys are all so- There's someone to the right.

1004
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:40,520
Nice,

1005
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,080
nice grab.

1006
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:46,940
Yeah, help his main, help his main.

1007
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:48,620
Okay.

1008
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:55,260
Can you top me off real quick?

1009
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:57,240
Thank you.

1010
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,160
Jesus Christ.

1011
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:01,540
Oh!

1012
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:04,900
Oh!

1013
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:07,440
That's a lot.

1014
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:08,500
Rose Hulk.

1015
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:11,940
Nice.

1016
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:12,760
Alright.

1017
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,940
I think season ends when Battle Pass ends.

1018
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:17,940
That's usually how things work.

1019
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,120
Get the Nomura?

1020
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:20,040
I'm gonna wear one.

1021
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,040
That's usually it.

1022
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,820
That's a lot of fucking oats.

1023
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,000
They should have Strangel here.

1024
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,660
Points moving, points moving, points moving.

1025
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:30,420
Oh!

1026
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,400
Goodbye, Magneto.

1027
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:38,840
He almost got crushed.

1028
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,300
Rose Hulk, Hulk half, Hulk half.

1029
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:42,740
Hulk low.

1030
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:46,820
I got- Come here, come here.

1031
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,480
That's huge.

1032
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:54,680
Strangel, Strangel, Strangel!

1033
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:02,720
I'm trying.

1034
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:04,540
I'm trying!

1035
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:06,980
I'm trying so hard.

1036
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:09,800
I have a Hulk on me though.

1037
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,080
Bro, I- We have no supports.

1038
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:23,920
I'm like, what do you want me to do?

1039
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:24,560
I'm just popping!

1040
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:27,540
I'm popping as hard as I can!

1041
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,460
All I do is clap!

1042
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:53,150
Hulk on me, Hulk on me.

1043
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:57,400
Hulk is still on me.

1044
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:58,900
Hulk ulted me.

1045
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,120
I'm gonna die.

1046
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:01,240
Yeah.

1047
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,160
He's still- Bro, what do I do?

1048
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:08,780
I just get clapped!

1049
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,200
He just claps harder!

1050
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,800
He just claps harder!

1051
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:24,700
My claps are not strong enough!

1052
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:28,300
It's just, just teeny tiny claps!

1053
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:31,660
Wait, wait!

1054
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,500
He stopped me off, he stopped me off.

1055
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:36,960
Thank you.

1056
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,500
There's a Hulk next to us, yep.

1057
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:44,860
I can, I can.

1058
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,020
Oh my god, I was 96%!

1059
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:49,440
I'm down.

1060
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:57,120
I was 96%.

1061
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,160
What do I do?

1062
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:02,100
Yeah, we can TP back.

1063
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:08,850
I think I have well here.

1064
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:10,990
They're looking for me.

1065
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:13,110
TP on high ground, TP on high ground.

1066
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:15,930
What are you, wait, hello?

1067
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:19,110
Oh, oh, oh!

1068
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:20,310
Mac, you have to touch, Mac!

1069
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:24,090
I can ult this if needed to.

1070
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:26,890
I'm ulting it.

1071
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:31,930
That's, that's awkward!

1072
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:35,510
That's, that's...

1073
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:36,490
I'm going to get to her left.

1074
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:41,170
I'm going to die to the Hulk.

1075
00:59:43,470 --> 00:59:44,630
Oh my god!

1076
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:47,730
That's so awkward!

1077
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:48,070
That's so weird!

1078
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:59,510
What the fuck happened?

1079
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:08,050
What the fuck happened there?

1080
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:15,210
What the fuck happened?

1081
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:18,470
We just saw him and he just, he just closed it.

1082
01:00:21,810 --> 01:00:22,930
I couldn't do anything.

1083
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:26,870
I had like, um, I just had a Hulk on me 24-7.

1084
01:00:28,650 --> 01:00:33,530
It was, uh, that was a little awkward.

1085
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:45,090
Yeah, the Hulk was like, straight up just be like, fuck her!

1086
01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:50,990
I'm gonna get on her until she fucking uninstalls the game.

1087
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:52,610
Or cry.

1088
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:56,490
And I'm, oh, I'm very close to doing a second thing.

1089
01:00:58,030 --> 01:01:01,510
And this is exactly why we ban Hulk, guys.

1090
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:04,130
And I'm fucking doing it right now.

1091
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:09,150
Like, yeah, like, I'm doing that right fucking now.

1092
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:14,670
It's so true.

1093
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:16,470
Ever that shit show?

1094
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:18,890
Fuck Hulk in general.

1095
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:24,490
Jesus Christ.

1096
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:30,690
The fact that the Wolverine brought the Hulk to me and I fucking just died.

1097
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:32,730
I was like, no!

1098
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,010
There were two tanks.

1099
01:01:36,370 --> 01:01:37,690
There were two fucking tanks.

1100
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:40,490
Why did you bring that other tank over?

1101
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:44,770
You could have brought the second tank.

1102
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:51,310
Oh my god.

1103
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:53,710
What the fuck do I play?

1104
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:56,590
Um...

1105
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:57,490
I guess Loki.

1106
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:03,190
I guess I guess I do Loki.

1107
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,420
Oh my god.

1108
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:09,340
That's fine.

1109
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:11,180
That's fine.

1110
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:13,740
Wait, no Mantis?

1111
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,260
You're not gonna fucking play Mantis?

1112
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,280
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1113
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,300
What the fuck is wrong?

1114
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:22,360
What the fuck is wrong?

1115
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:29,080
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1116
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:31,520
Why would you willingly play Cloak and Dagger?

1117
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:33,960
Cloak and Dagger over...

1118
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,460
Okay, that's fine.

1119
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:37,840
That's fine.

1120
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:42,340
Yippee.

1121
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:45,540
Three supports is meta, but you need Adam for it.

1122
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:46,980
So we're just...

1123
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:49,220
We're trying.

1124
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:49,420
We're trying.

1125
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:54,500
We'll just...

1126
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:55,440
We'll just make it work.

1127
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:01,640
Usually you have two... whatever fucking support you want, and then Adam.

1128
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:05,000
But now it's just, fuck it, Weeball.

1129
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,400
Who willingly plays Rocket?

1130
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,980
People who don't have... I'm sorry.

1131
01:03:20,890 --> 01:03:21,770
I'm sorry.

1132
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:28,490
Jesus Christ.

1133
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:35,090
Oh, he's so low too.

1134
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:44,520
Who's on the other side anyway?

1135
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:52,650
Are we on our side or their side?

1136
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:53,490
I can't tell.

1137
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:55,730
I legitimately don't know which side we're on.

1138
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:58,610
I... I don't know.

1139
01:04:02,290 --> 01:04:03,810
Oh my god.

1140
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:09,010
Somebody...

1141
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:10,610
Jesus Christ.

1142
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:14,390
I don't... I don't know what's going on.

1143
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:17,570
I hope things are happening.

1144
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:24,990
I hope things are happening right now, because I have no idea what's happening.

1145
01:04:25,690 --> 01:04:27,570
Oh, he's coming in.

1146
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:29,310
He's coming in.

1147
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:31,910
Oh my god!

1148
01:04:32,350 --> 01:04:33,470
Is he alive?

1149
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:37,830
Please!

1150
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:40,530
Something happened!

1151
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:45,310
Oh my god, he missed.

1152
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:46,370
Fucking nerd.

1153
01:04:47,310 --> 01:04:49,270
I... I can't... No!

1154
01:04:49,530 --> 01:04:50,550
He didn't miss.

1155
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:53,610
He didn't fucking miss, that's for sure.

1156
01:04:56,870 --> 01:04:58,070
Oh my god.

1157
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:01,350
He didn't miss, though.

1158
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:03,250
That was...

1159
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:05,070
That was... Oh my god.

1160
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:07,870
That was a lot of nothing.

1161
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:11,490
That was actually a lot of nothing.

1162
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:13,750
That's crazy.

1163
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:14,770
Nothing happened.

1164
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:18,950
After all that, nothing happened in the end.

1165
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:24,710
That's actually crazy.

1166
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:27,470
How nothing just happened.

1167
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:41,930
All three supports got fucked up.

1168
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:43,790
I don't know what else to say.

1169
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:45,190
One got eaten.

1170
01:05:45,450 --> 01:05:46,990
I got pushed by Mag.

1171
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:48,050
It's just...

1172
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:50,150
It's just unfortunate.

1173
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:51,530
Just...

1174
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:54,590
Just an unfortunate team up right there.

1175
01:05:56,830 --> 01:05:57,790
Just...

1176
01:05:57,790 --> 01:05:59,330
Just an unfortunate one.

1177
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,260
Yeah, literally that's a rough game.

1178
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:07,900
I can't play.

1179
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:19,220
Our kit is so dog shit.

1180
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:24,200
Hahaha.

1181
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:40,820
He's too busy shit talking to Jeff to fucking listen to the team.

1182
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:42,960
Hahaha.

1183
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:44,960
He's too...

1184
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,680
He's just like... Our team's like, Hey, maybe you should swap off Rocket.

1185
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:50,920
And he's still shit talking to Jeff.

1186
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:52,960
Like...

1187
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,140
You are random.

1188
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:55,940
What?

1189
01:06:58,780 --> 01:06:59,540
Shit.

1190
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,220
Oh my god, Lucky10, where did you get that ego?

1191
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:05,360
You're on fucking Rocket Raccoon.

1192
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,120
The easiest fucking support out there.

1193
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,340
Where do you get that ego?

1194
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,300
You literally don't have to think.

1195
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:14,460
Hahaha.

1196
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:17,660
Where did that ego fucking come from?

1197
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:25,620
He's not dropping the infinite at all.

1198
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:27,980
Hahaha.

1199
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:33,110
Oh my god.

1200
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:35,290
I can't play.

1201
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:37,890
Holy shit, I can't play.

1202
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:38,330
Bro.

1203
01:07:40,970 --> 01:07:41,770
Hahaha.

1204
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:43,070
Sorry.

1205
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:46,450
I'm trying to focus, but I can't.

1206
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:49,430
He turned Rocket, please.

1207
01:07:49,550 --> 01:07:50,290
He turned Rocket.

1208
01:07:58,810 --> 01:08:00,190
Oh my god.

1209
01:08:02,310 --> 01:08:03,590
Oh my god.

1210
01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:04,070
Oh my god.

1211
01:08:04,070 --> 01:08:04,990
I'm over here.

1212
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:09,110
How did we live that?

1213
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:11,670
Did I get it off?

1214
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:13,010
I did.

1215
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:14,310
I existed.

1216
01:08:15,850 --> 01:08:17,190
Oh my god.

1217
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:20,990
Jesus.

1218
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:22,230
Are you alive?

1219
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:23,850
You are.

1220
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:24,590
How?

1221
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:30,990
Oh my god.

1222
01:08:31,630 --> 01:08:33,790
What the fuck is going on?

1223
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:35,250
I don't know.

1224
01:08:40,770 --> 01:08:44,270
Legitimately, how does our Rocket have this ego?

1225
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:50,170
Oh my god, are you serious?

1226
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:50,410
Are you serious?

1227
01:08:51,950 --> 01:08:52,670
Hahaha.

1228
01:08:53,870 --> 01:08:54,790
I thought he knew.

1229
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:56,810
I thought he knew the window was broken.

1230
01:09:00,190 --> 01:09:01,950
Who hit me?

1231
01:09:02,330 --> 01:09:04,210
Holy shit, what's going on?

1232
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:04,790
Wait.

1233
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:10,850
What's going on?

1234
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:12,350
Oh my god.

1235
01:09:12,970 --> 01:09:14,690
I got hit by everything.

1236
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:17,910
What is happening?

1237
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:21,910
What is happening in my game?

1238
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:25,650
Ted, please!

1239
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:28,790
Stop!

1240
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:40,230
Who the fuck is on point?

1241
01:09:40,330 --> 01:09:42,350
Oh wait, we actually lost point.

1242
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:49,450
No!

1243
01:09:49,450 --> 01:09:50,430
No!

1244
01:09:52,450 --> 01:09:56,490
Oh my god, I couldn't reposition myself.

1245
01:09:57,730 --> 01:09:59,290
That's fine.

1246
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:00,970
That's so fine.

1247
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:04,870
That's so fine.

1248
01:10:05,190 --> 01:10:10,790
Oh my god.

1249
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:19,050
I don't know what's going on in this game.

1250
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:20,830
I feel like I'm just...

1251
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:23,430
Ted, stop!

1252
01:10:24,450 --> 01:10:26,050
Stop talking!

1253
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:28,210
Who are you even talking to, Ted?

1254
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:31,770
Nobody fucking cares about your opinion!

1255
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:33,610
You're on Rocket Raccoon!

1256
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:36,710
Your life doesn't matter in this game.

1257
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:38,130
You're in game.

1258
01:10:39,290 --> 01:10:40,010
Okay.

1259
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:49,970
Why so much hate?

1260
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:54,350
He's like, he's still shit-talking.

1261
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:58,910
Like, nobody's talking to him and he's still shit-talking.

1262
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:07,110
This is why you take out your voice chat, right?

1263
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:18,590
He's just a little guy from... He's been like shit-talking the fucking chat the entire time and like not playing the game.

1264
01:11:18,710 --> 01:11:22,650
We were yelling at him to give us infinite and he just doesn't care.

1265
01:11:23,550 --> 01:11:24,990
Oh, no.

1266
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:28,410
Just bully me like... Oh, fuck it.

1267
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:35,150
Oh my god.

1268
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:37,530
I don't know!

1269
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:41,930
Where's my team?!

1270
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:46,190
Where's my team?!

1271
01:11:48,650 --> 01:11:49,590
No!

1272
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:54,870
I couldn't see anything!

1273
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:56,950
Everybody was just...

1274
01:11:59,570 --> 01:12:04,850
I don't even know what the fuck happened there.

1275
01:12:04,850 --> 01:12:06,810
How did we win the point?

1276
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:13,410
Did you kill him?

1277
01:12:13,670 --> 01:12:14,130
I don't know.

1278
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:19,410
I got you.

1279
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:25,590
Wait, they're on point, they're on point, they're on point.

1280
01:12:25,930 --> 01:12:27,130
Oh wait, nevermind.

1281
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:28,170
Black panther on me?

1282
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:39,180
Oh, I can't see.

1283
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:40,120
I can't see anything.

1284
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:43,600
Oh my god.

1285
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:46,100
That's fine.

1286
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:47,920
I'm alive, I guess.

1287
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:48,820
I can just fight point.

1288
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:50,540
Alright.

1289
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:55,540
I have black panther sleeping on me.

1290
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:00,040
Please!

1291
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:02,640
Everywhere I go!

1292
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:07,500
How do I live?!

1293
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,780
Everywhere I go, there's someone there!

1294
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:11,200
I can't live!

1295
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:15,660
There's no safe place!

1296
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:18,500
I'm like, alright, I'll position myself here.

1297
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:21,860
Alright, let me position myself there.

1298
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:25,720
I feel like I get fucked over the most.

1299
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,540
All I have is one sleep.

1300
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:32,100
Literally one sleep, that's all I have.

1301
01:13:37,590 --> 01:13:39,010
Oh my god.

1302
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:42,190
Here we go.

1303
01:13:44,930 --> 01:13:46,490
Alright, here we go!

1304
01:13:48,890 --> 01:13:50,110
Here we go!

1305
01:13:52,730 --> 01:13:53,930
There's no more to it, right?

1306
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:56,210
No more to have?

1307
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:00,780
Black panther?

1308
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:01,720
Black panther is low.

1309
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:07,740
Careful, Meku.

1310
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:08,940
We can't see you.

1311
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,320
Black panther's on you.

1312
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:14,480
Oh my god.

1313
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,220
Yeah, they have strange ult.

1314
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:24,000
I don't know what to do.

1315
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:29,250
I feel like I'm just gonna get fucking jumped at again.

1316
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:34,600
They're on point.

1317
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:39,800
I'm trying to be with you, Mek.

1318
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:47,600
Oh, sleeping sleeping strange.

1319
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:52,300
Strange behind us, strange behind us.

1320
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:55,440
Sorry.

1321
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:58,560
Strange is half, strange is half.

1322
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:01,880
Strange is one, strange is one.

1323
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:05,060
I'm on Magneto, Magneto one.

1324
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:13,020
Oh my god, we won that.

1325
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:13,480
How?

1326
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,380
How did we win that?

1327
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:17,120
How?

1328
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:18,620
How did we?

1329
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:21,460
How did we win that?

1330
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:24,620
Another rocket tummy.

1331
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:29,300
Recruit deserved open wake.

1332
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:35,980
I only have a loving wife and a kid.

1333
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:39,760
Go spend time with the family.

1334
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:47,800
I'm playing it twice that day.

1335
01:16:44,370 --> 01:16:50,330
I just need you guys to know the rocket hate, it's not just me.

1336
01:16:55,430 --> 01:17:03,650
Rocket raccoon and high elo is universally Okay, it's justified.

1337
01:17:03,670 --> 01:17:05,090
Okay, guys.

1338
01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:11,650
It's so justified.

1339
01:17:13,270 --> 01:17:17,470
Because it's like one of the... it's like, basically, they're like...

1340
01:17:17,470 --> 01:17:22,310
It's currently Rocky Raccoon is one of the easiest support characters out there.

1341
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:28,830
You'd think it's Luna, but Luna requires... at least has some aim requirement for like her freeze and everything.

1342
01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:33,190
And like, but Rocky Raccoon is just, I climb this, I left click.

1343
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:37,930
And then sometimes I pull the Z out and I hide my E very well.

1344
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:47,940
So, people are mad because like, there's better support combos.

1345
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:51,440
There's better support combos you can play.

1346
01:17:51,740 --> 01:17:55,820
Like Luna-Mantis, Luna-Mantis-Adam, Adam-Loki.

1347
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:58,740
Like, just like Mantis-Adam, Mantis-Loki.

1348
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:04,640
Stuff like that, because like, the other team-up support matchups are like, just so much better.

1349
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:06,820
Versus like, Rocky Raccoon.

1350
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:09,600
So, he's just a little guy.

1351
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:17,760
And like, usually Rocky Raccoon players in this ELO, they can't flex to other characters.

1352
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:23,200
Yes, I am a Raccoon apologizer!

1353
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:31,140
That's just Cope.

1354
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:37,620
What about Dagger?

1355
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:41,400
Well, if like Luna is banned, you have to play Dagger.

1356
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:46,260
Unless you, unless your team can like, make sure they don't die.

1357
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:51,200
Because like, if you play Mantis-Adam, it's like really scary.

1358
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:56,880
Because you have to play with super low heals and just hope to god your team doesn't fucking feed.

1359
01:19:02,330 --> 01:19:03,610
That's really it.

1360
01:19:07,150 --> 01:19:09,490
Oh, this is a GM1 lobby.

1361
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:13,050
Ooh, this is a GM1 lobby.

1362
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:15,250
Ooh, this is a low ELO lobby here.

1363
01:19:15,330 --> 01:19:16,050
That's scary.

1364
01:19:16,890 --> 01:19:17,950
Whoa, that's scary!

1365
01:19:20,170 --> 01:19:23,190
He's just a silly, silly Raccoon.

1366
01:19:23,310 --> 01:19:24,570
Just a little Raccoon.

1367
01:19:28,090 --> 01:19:29,910
I wanna play Spider-Man!

1368
01:19:30,150 --> 01:19:31,130
I wanna play Spider-Man!

1369
01:19:32,910 --> 01:19:35,610
Oh, we have a fucking, we have a Hulk main.

1370
01:19:36,190 --> 01:19:38,070
No, I wish I could just ban your character.

1371
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:42,750
I wish I could just ban your character right now.

1372
01:19:44,350 --> 01:19:46,270
If I could, I would.

1373
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:48,190
Ban Spider-Man!

1374
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:54,690
That Doki's standard is high now.

1375
01:19:54,950 --> 01:19:59,110
Ever since I, I don't know guys, ever since I got Eternity, I don't really talk to...

1376
01:20:05,230 --> 01:20:06,710
Let's see.

1377
01:20:09,690 --> 01:20:11,510
Yeah, that's right.

1378
01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:13,570
My ego has been inflated.

1379
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:17,430
Now that's an ego.

1380
01:20:18,190 --> 01:20:19,770
I gotta, gotta...

1381
01:20:20,910 --> 01:20:22,990
Gotta lower myself.

1382
01:20:27,730 --> 01:20:31,130
What the fuck is wrong with them?

1383
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:34,310
Spider-Man?

1384
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:38,770
What the fuck is your problem?

1385
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:47,010
But, I'm not a one trick.

1386
01:20:48,030 --> 01:20:48,930
That's great to hear.

1387
01:20:49,130 --> 01:20:50,290
That's what I like to hear.

1388
01:20:50,450 --> 01:20:54,070
So are we actually playing Captain America or...

1389
01:20:55,530 --> 01:20:56,490
Hey, he's, he's...

1390
01:20:56,490 --> 01:20:57,170
I'm not being pranked right now.

1391
01:20:57,570 --> 01:20:59,230
He's seen the Japanese curry videos.

1392
01:20:59,910 --> 01:21:00,350
What?

1393
01:21:00,530 --> 01:21:01,390
Where are the cameras at?

1394
01:21:01,470 --> 01:21:02,190
Where are the cameras at?

1395
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:02,650
What?

1396
01:21:06,730 --> 01:21:08,990
If I ever face you in rank, I'm gonna play Rocket.

1397
01:21:09,170 --> 01:21:09,950
Oh, feel free to.

1398
01:21:10,030 --> 01:21:11,050
I'm gonna avoid you.

1399
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:15,370
My game crashed!

1400
01:21:15,550 --> 01:21:15,750
No!

1401
01:21:18,610 --> 01:21:19,090
No!

1402
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:22,270
No!

1403
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:25,720
Let me in!

1404
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:26,560
No!

1405
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:38,200
Let me in!

1406
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:39,260
Let me in!

1407
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:40,620
I don't wanna lose!

1408
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:41,880
No, my point!

1409
01:21:45,070 --> 01:21:47,730
Oh my god, please, please, please!

1410
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:48,810
I haven't lost!

1411
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:49,830
Please, let me in!

1412
01:21:51,130 --> 01:21:51,730
Let me in!

1413
01:21:51,790 --> 01:21:52,190
Let me in!

1414
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:52,710
Let me in!

1415
01:21:52,770 --> 01:21:53,310
Let me in!

1416
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:56,470
Oh my god, let me in!

1417
01:21:56,510 --> 01:21:56,990
Let me in!

1418
01:21:57,050 --> 01:21:57,530
Let me in!

1419
01:21:57,610 --> 01:21:58,050
Let me in!

1420
01:21:58,110 --> 01:21:58,550
Let me in!

1421
01:21:58,610 --> 01:21:59,050
Let me in!

1422
01:21:59,110 --> 01:21:59,690
Let me in!

1423
01:22:00,990 --> 01:22:05,810
Yes, but if I don't reconnect in a minute, it casts as a match.

1424
01:22:06,830 --> 01:22:07,650
Come on, let me in!

1425
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:08,170
Let me in!

1426
01:22:08,210 --> 01:22:08,750
Let me in!

1427
01:22:09,130 --> 01:22:09,770
Let me in!

1428
01:22:09,830 --> 01:22:10,330
Let me in!

1429
01:22:10,430 --> 01:22:11,050
Let me in!

1430
01:22:11,050 --> 01:22:11,830
Let me in!

1431
01:22:12,110 --> 01:22:12,750
Let me in!

1432
01:22:15,070 --> 01:22:17,590
We have to stop them from securing the mission area.

1433
01:22:18,530 --> 01:22:19,510
Oh my god.

1434
01:22:21,170 --> 01:22:25,250
Oh my god, I'm here, I'm here, I'm sorry!

1435
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:28,610
It crashed because I was shit-talking Rocky Raccoon players.

1436
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:31,790
Oh my god, I'm...

1437
01:22:32,770 --> 01:22:34,610
There you go, I'm so sorry.

1438
01:22:35,610 --> 01:22:36,370
You're chilling.

1439
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:39,410
Oh my god.

1440
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:43,570
Oh my god.

1441
01:22:45,070 --> 01:22:46,930
Get off Captain America, bro, please.

1442
01:22:55,630 --> 01:22:57,070
Oh my god.

1443
01:22:58,590 --> 01:22:59,190
I'm back.

1444
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:03,940
Oh, I can't see you, Mac.

1445
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:04,460
I can't see you.

1446
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:05,500
He's chasing you.

1447
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:15,830
We're even right now.

1448
01:23:18,810 --> 01:23:19,770
Oh my god.

1449
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:27,460
Oh, we're up one.

1450
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:34,700
Oh, wait, wait, strangers left, strangers left, strangers left, strangers left.

1451
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:39,820
We can match this up first.

1452
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:43,200
We can press Q, guys.

1453
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:44,560
Okay.

1454
01:23:56,660 --> 01:23:58,080
They have strangers.

1455
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:05,320
Oh, four seconds, three, two, one.

1456
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:11,340
Oh my god, break the glass so I can go through.

1457
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:16,040
Oh my god.

1458
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:21,940
Okay, I'm getting off this fucking character real quick.

1459
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:29,620
I got into that area.

1460
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:31,540
Why do you have strangers left?

1461
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:32,550
He's looking for all...

1462
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:36,540
Oh, and it's me.

1463
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:45,420
Oh my god.

1464
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:48,240
Of course, it's me.

1465
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,960
He's fucking lost it, fellas.

1466
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:04,500
It's okay, he's off Captain America.

1467
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:06,080
We will win, we will win.

1468
01:25:13,010 --> 01:25:14,670
Oh my god, it's fine.

1469
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:24,720
Finally, at least he's off Captain America, right?

1470
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:27,880
Oh my

1471
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:36,960
god.

1472
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:43,660
We can match this up first.

1473
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:48,340
Okay, um...

1474
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:59,450
I'm a little scared here.

1475
01:26:02,050 --> 01:26:02,470
Okay.

1476
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:09,000
Oh, I'm ulting this.

1477
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:09,420
Oh.

1478
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:15,540
Alright.

1479
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:18,360
Oh, I got headshot.

1480
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:23,160
Oh my god.

1481
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:27,540
Maybe I shouldn't have came back.

1482
01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:30,860
Oh, I got locked out.

1483
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:49,740
Oh my god.

1484
01:26:49,740 --> 01:26:51,760
Guys, I don't...

1485
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:53,820
Guys...

1486
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:56,860
I was even the only one that shit-talked Rocket.

1487
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:58,040
Why did it hit me?

1488
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:03,840
I was even the only one!

1489
01:27:11,950 --> 01:27:16,830
I wasn't even the only one that hated Rocket.

1490
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:18,770
I'm going Rocket, good luck, have fun.

1491
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:25,470
Oh my god, no, he mental boomed.

1492
01:27:25,630 --> 01:27:28,490
He actually mental boomed after that.

1493
01:27:28,830 --> 01:27:29,570
I'm down for a TP.

1494
01:27:34,430 --> 01:27:36,190
He fucking, he quit.

1495
01:27:36,450 --> 01:27:36,930
I'm down.

1496
01:27:39,990 --> 01:27:41,890
Rocket, you shit.

1497
01:27:44,610 --> 01:27:48,270
I don't know, they got through in three minutes.

1498
01:27:48,510 --> 01:27:49,970
I didn't get through.

1499
01:27:51,070 --> 01:27:54,890
This is looking a little dire right now.

1500
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:56,450
And Mesa's...

1501
01:27:56,450 --> 01:27:57,690
You know...

1502
01:27:57,690 --> 01:28:00,670
You know he's fucking done when he's on Groot.

1503
01:28:02,170 --> 01:28:03,710
Oh, he is...

1504
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:06,190
He is not having it now.

1505
01:28:06,190 --> 01:28:08,750
He's off Magneto, he's fucking, it's over.

1506
01:28:20,330 --> 01:28:22,270
There's a Starlord right behind us.

1507
01:28:35,430 --> 01:28:39,710
Hey, everything went okay.

1508
01:28:40,510 --> 01:28:40,770
Wow!

1509
01:28:43,890 --> 01:28:45,530
We're so locked in!

1510
01:28:49,210 --> 01:28:50,150
I'm Groot.

1511
01:28:50,850 --> 01:28:51,150
Okay.

1512
01:28:51,830 --> 01:28:53,270
Alright, here we go.

1513
01:28:53,850 --> 01:28:54,490
I'm Groot.

1514
01:28:54,510 --> 01:28:55,630
I can't see you, I can't see you, Mac.

1515
01:28:56,290 --> 01:28:58,050
Oh wait, not Mac, sorry, it's Tiro.

1516
01:28:59,490 --> 01:29:00,410
I'm Groot.

1517
01:29:00,570 --> 01:29:01,310
I'm Groot!

1518
01:29:02,590 --> 01:29:06,010
I don't know why I thought Mac was the Hawkeye for a second.

1519
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:06,970
I'm Groot.

1520
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:09,270
I'm just so used to seeing him on Hawkeye.

1521
01:29:10,730 --> 01:29:12,230
Oh, you're all so dumb.

1522
01:29:12,810 --> 01:29:13,590
You're all so...

1523
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:14,210
Hawkeye's low.

1524
01:29:17,710 --> 01:29:18,390
Hawkeye's low.

1525
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:19,630
Oh.

1526
01:29:21,370 --> 01:29:22,830
We're even, we're even right now.

1527
01:29:23,810 --> 01:29:24,490
Hawkeye's low.

1528
01:29:24,850 --> 01:29:25,230
Oh.

1529
01:29:25,730 --> 01:29:27,370
Wait, Starlord's low, Starlord's so low.

1530
01:29:31,310 --> 01:29:32,830
I am Groot, I am Groot!

1531
01:29:34,590 --> 01:29:35,430
Speak well!

1532
01:29:35,850 --> 01:29:37,450
I'm ready to put on a show!

1533
01:29:38,450 --> 01:29:39,890
Friends, gather round!

1534
01:29:39,910 --> 01:29:40,790
They have Strangel here.

1535
01:29:41,150 --> 01:29:42,570
And Starlord will come in.

1536
01:29:43,270 --> 01:29:45,030
Yeah, double two, double two together.

1537
01:29:45,030 --> 01:29:46,870
I'm just gonna roll here and get Mantis out of the way.

1538
01:29:48,310 --> 01:29:48,910
Alright.

1539
01:29:52,570 --> 01:29:53,770
I ulted.

1540
01:29:54,010 --> 01:29:55,910
They're gonna Starlord ult after this.

1541
01:30:00,810 --> 01:30:01,410
Oh.

1542
01:30:02,770 --> 01:30:04,710
There we, there it is!

1543
01:30:04,950 --> 01:30:06,050
There it is!

1544
01:30:10,770 --> 01:30:11,670
I'm so...

1545
01:30:11,970 --> 01:30:13,170
I don't feel safe.

1546
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:14,410
I know!

1547
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:21,390
They used both DPS ults, so they don't have anything anymore.

1548
01:30:22,910 --> 01:30:23,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1549
01:30:27,030 --> 01:30:27,670
I'm Groot.

1550
01:30:27,870 --> 01:30:28,750
Are you okay, man?

1551
01:30:28,790 --> 01:30:29,590
Are you okay, buddy?

1552
01:30:30,230 --> 01:30:31,570
Nah, dude, I'm dead as shit.

1553
01:30:32,530 --> 01:30:33,390
We're good, we're good, we're good.

1554
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:43,500
I still can't believe I crashed there.

1555
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:45,440
I don't even know, like...

1556
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,420
Oh my god.

1557
01:30:47,260 --> 01:30:48,020
It just happens?

1558
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:48,920
I don't even know.

1559
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:51,100
It just happens.

1560
01:30:51,820 --> 01:30:52,480
That's a huge ult.

1561
01:30:56,180 --> 01:30:58,080
Strange half, strange half in there, inside.

1562
01:30:58,940 --> 01:31:00,020
Strange close, strange close.

1563
01:31:03,020 --> 01:31:03,460
Starlord!

1564
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:04,200
Oh my god.

1565
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:06,460
I can't see you back!

1566
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:08,900
I'm Groot.

1567
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:11,660
He's Groot, he's Groot, he's Groot.

1568
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:12,760
He's Grooting, he's Grooting.

1569
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:14,700
Groot.

1570
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:16,000
He's getting Groot all over them.

1571
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:17,980
Groot, am I?

1572
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:19,520
I'm Groot.

1573
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:20,200
Oh, awesome character.

1574
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:21,860
When does that door open again, man?

1575
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:22,960
I'm gonna freak the fuck out.

1576
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:31,880
Luna one, Luna one in the back.

1577
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:34,720
Hawkeye dead.

1578
01:31:34,980 --> 01:31:35,920
We're down one.

1579
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:37,080
Wait, they're low, they're low!

1580
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:37,900
Strange one, strange one!

1581
01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:40,940
Starlord one, Starlord one!

1582
01:31:42,260 --> 01:31:44,260
I killed Starlord.

1583
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:46,520
Luna on cart.

1584
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:49,480
I'm on my way.

1585
01:31:55,020 --> 01:32:01,300
I think I died.

1586
01:32:02,540 --> 01:32:04,340
Alright, I'm ulting, ulting on point, ulting on point.

1587
01:32:07,340 --> 01:32:09,260
I'm on cart, I'm ulting on cart, I'm ulting on cart.

1588
01:32:14,550 --> 01:32:15,370
Ult's gone, ult's gone.

1589
01:32:17,170 --> 01:32:17,270
Fuck!

1590
01:32:21,650 --> 01:32:21,950
No!

1591
01:32:26,300 --> 01:32:28,920
Bro, I think you should just die there and reset.

1592
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,280
You're so healthy.

1593
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:43,860
And they have Hawkeye ult, right?

1594
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:45,720
I heard.

1595
01:32:46,540 --> 01:32:46,880
Yeah.

1596
01:32:47,060 --> 01:32:47,620
We have no bubble.

1597
01:32:50,780 --> 01:32:52,240
Oh, Starlord half?

1598
01:32:56,910 --> 01:32:58,710
He's gonna do it, he's gonna do it.

1599
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:06,180
Oh my god, no!

1600
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:07,820
Wait, oh goodbye.

1601
01:33:11,330 --> 01:33:11,780
Hawkeye low.

1602
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:15,500
I'm gonna pop over, I'm dead.

1603
01:33:19,350 --> 01:33:20,820
That's actually huge, what the hell?

1604
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:23,480
I'm dead, I'm alive!

1605
01:33:24,020 --> 01:33:24,820
Not yet!

1606
01:33:25,180 --> 01:33:26,160
You're alive.

1607
01:33:27,260 --> 01:33:27,880
Oh!

1608
01:33:28,260 --> 01:33:29,400
I didn't realize.

1609
01:33:33,370 --> 01:33:36,070
Oh my god, this is...

1610
01:33:36,070 --> 01:33:38,290
This is a little bit messy.

1611
01:33:39,290 --> 01:33:40,550
This is...

1612
01:33:40,550 --> 01:33:41,790
I don't have anything.

1613
01:33:43,130 --> 01:33:44,530
I'm 1%, I got it.

1614
01:33:49,990 --> 01:33:51,190
That's alright.

1615
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,420
Oh my god!

1616
01:33:59,660 --> 01:34:00,160
Hi!

1617
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:01,620
I have a Starlord on me.

1618
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:04,500
Starlord, Starlord, Starlord one!

1619
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:11,680
It's just me and Mantis.

1620
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:14,100
We're coming back, we're coming back.

1621
01:34:14,420 --> 01:34:15,380
15 seconds.

1622
01:34:18,860 --> 01:34:19,360
Oh!

1623
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:22,740
Guys, this ain't looking too hot.

1624
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:26,460
They have their support ults too.

1625
01:34:31,350 --> 01:34:32,090
Oh!

1626
01:34:32,690 --> 01:34:33,430
Fat!

1627
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:37,810
Oh, bye guys!

1628
01:34:41,830 --> 01:34:43,950
Oh, Magneto's frozen!

1629
01:34:45,810 --> 01:34:47,030
Guys, I...

1630
01:34:47,030 --> 01:34:49,610
This is not looking so hot.

1631
01:34:50,390 --> 01:34:51,910
Wait, Magneto one, Magneto one!

1632
01:34:59,190 --> 01:35:01,330
Starlord one, literally 1 HP.

1633
01:35:04,330 --> 01:35:05,730
Okay, low, dead.

1634
01:35:06,750 --> 01:35:07,170
He's rooting!

1635
01:35:07,970 --> 01:35:10,050
I don't know why we're still going.

1636
01:35:12,550 --> 01:35:13,450
They have Bucky, they have Bucky.

1637
01:35:14,050 --> 01:35:14,650
He ulted!

1638
01:35:14,870 --> 01:35:15,210
No!

1639
01:35:15,450 --> 01:35:16,410
Oh, no!

1640
01:35:18,150 --> 01:35:19,310
Point him, point him, point him, point him!

1641
01:35:19,650 --> 01:35:20,730
Oh, we're good, we're good, we're good.

1642
01:35:20,770 --> 01:35:21,110
Oh, nice.

1643
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:32,980
You only have Mantis heals over there.

1644
01:35:37,460 --> 01:35:40,180
I need to get a cough drop real fast.

1645
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:43,760
Do you want me to start ulting again?

1646
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:45,460
I'm going to wipe with Groot.

1647
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:47,760
Possibly.

1648
01:35:48,780 --> 01:35:50,300
Oh, no, no, no.

1649
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:53,900
I'm going to go now.

1650
01:35:55,060 --> 01:35:55,440
Alright.

1651
01:35:56,580 --> 01:35:58,400
I'm going to...

1652
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:01,160
Alright, I'm back.

1653
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:02,960
They have strong ults.

1654
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:03,940
Strange ult here.

1655
01:36:06,580 --> 01:36:07,600
I'm ulting this.

1656
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:09,100
Sion, Sion on me.

1657
01:36:13,940 --> 01:36:16,180
Oh, my god!

1658
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:18,680
You fucking got exploded!

1659
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:21,660
I froze him!

1660
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:22,640
Oh, it's too late.

1661
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:28,600
I'm losing it.

1662
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:28,840
I'm losing it.

1663
01:36:30,180 --> 01:36:31,100
I'm going to the bin.

1664
01:36:36,700 --> 01:36:38,380
Holy shit, he fucking exploded!

1665
01:36:51,270 --> 01:36:52,050
How can I win?

1666
01:36:52,170 --> 01:36:52,950
I'm on your right, Sion.

1667
01:36:52,970 --> 01:36:53,510
I'm on your right.

1668
01:36:55,250 --> 01:36:56,310
Oh, my god.

1669
01:36:57,410 --> 01:36:58,190
I'm scared.

1670
01:36:59,530 --> 01:37:00,250
There's no one left.

1671
01:37:00,730 --> 01:37:01,130
I'm dead.

1672
01:37:01,130 --> 01:37:03,650
Oh, Magneto one, Magneto one!

1673
01:37:04,330 --> 01:37:06,330
Starlord behind me, Starlord behind me!

1674
01:37:10,290 --> 01:37:11,690
I'm getting off point.

1675
01:37:11,890 --> 01:37:13,310
I need it so I don't get killed.

1676
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:20,920
I'm scared.

1677
01:37:22,220 --> 01:37:23,840
They might have Starlord over here.

1678
01:37:27,740 --> 01:37:29,160
I can't see you, Mech.

1679
01:37:34,140 --> 01:37:34,820
That's you, that's you!

1680
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:35,520
I'm on Starlord.

1681
01:37:36,220 --> 01:37:36,540
Nice.

1682
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:39,540
I killed Hawkeye.

1683
01:37:45,340 --> 01:37:46,680
I'm reloading, I'm reloading here.

1684
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:48,080
Magneto one, Magneto one!

1685
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:52,300
I need reload.

1686
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:54,500
I have ult, I have ult, I have ult.

1687
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:55,680
Play on the cart if you need to.

1688
01:38:00,940 --> 01:38:01,940
Oh, Starlord, Starlord, Starlord!

1689
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:04,580
I'm dead, Hawkeye.

1690
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:05,520
Wow.

1691
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:07,320
Hey, guys.

1692
01:38:07,660 --> 01:38:10,040
I can't wait to defend this for three minutes.

1693
01:38:11,220 --> 01:38:12,680
Holy shit, what a comeback.

1694
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,140
Let's go, let's win this shit.

1695
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:14,940
Fuck it.

1696
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:19,880
I'm Luna Snow.

1697
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:21,520
Oh, my god.

1698
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:23,240
Guys, I'm so excited.

1699
01:38:23,780 --> 01:38:26,040
We do all that, and then we lose.

1700
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:33,140
We are going with low expectation, guys.

1701
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:35,060
I don't want you guys to get sad.

1702
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:37,100
Oh, four minutes, guys.

1703
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:38,540
Oh, my god, okay.

1704
01:38:41,180 --> 01:38:42,540
I don't want you guys to get sad.

1705
01:38:42,660 --> 01:38:45,020
I feel like, oh, my god, you lost the whole thing.

1706
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:45,720
Oh, my god.

1707
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:56,860
Everything will be okay, guys.

1708
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:58,780
This is Dirky Bear from the future.

1709
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:01,360
Everything will be okay.

1710
01:39:01,700 --> 01:39:03,380
We didn't win it, but...

1711
01:39:03,380 --> 01:39:04,320
I'm okay.

1712
01:39:05,660 --> 01:39:09,380
Surely, four minutes will pass by very quickly, right?

1713
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:14,740
Yeah, it's full push to cry in a minute.

1714
01:39:20,180 --> 01:39:22,980
I'll never shit talk another Rocket player again.

1715
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:31,600
Yeah, surely, they'd never suspect a TP.

1716
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:40,560
All right, let's see.

1717
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:43,020
Portal time, portal time.

1718
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:44,500
Portal time, portal time.

1719
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:51,000
Surely,

1720
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:57,480
they don't expect a TP, right, guys?

1721
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:06,360
I didn't even wait through the portal.

1722
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:07,580
Oh, my god.

1723
01:40:07,660 --> 01:40:09,600
I went through it again.

1724
01:40:19,700 --> 01:40:22,660
They're like, nah, we'll be fine.

1725
01:40:23,220 --> 01:40:24,860
They won't expect a portal.

1726
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:28,040
You know what?

1727
01:40:28,780 --> 01:40:29,880
It's all right, guys.

1728
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:31,940
We did our best.

1729
01:40:38,820 --> 01:40:39,660
You know what?

1730
01:40:39,660 --> 01:40:39,800
You know what?

1731
01:40:39,860 --> 01:40:41,200
It was great playing with you guys.

1732
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:43,080
Oh, wait, unless...

1733
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:46,180
Okay, I'm coming.

1734
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:50,460
Miz, I believe.

1735
01:40:54,780 --> 01:40:57,540
Sometimes the stream just outplays us.

1736
01:40:58,060 --> 01:40:59,900
Yeah, sometimes it just happens.

1737
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:04,280
How did that even happen?

1738
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:07,620
So, wait, who all fell for that?

1739
01:41:11,300 --> 01:41:13,100
Who died to that, anyway?

1740
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:15,420
Yeah, that shit was crazy.

1741
01:41:15,900 --> 01:41:16,220
I died.

1742
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:24,700
So what happened was that he placed the portal and then the Enemy Strange placed the portal right after mid-jump.

1743
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:29,600
My head hurts.

1744
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:41,000
I just got a notification that they're doing maintenance on my internet in six minutes, so...

1745
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:44,020
Good thing this is my last game.

1746
01:41:45,820 --> 01:41:46,100
Damn.

1747
01:41:47,120 --> 01:41:47,560
Damn.

1748
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:49,560
That's rough.

1749
01:41:52,580 --> 01:41:53,260
Let's draw.

1750
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:55,960
Maybe we can draw, yeah.

1751
01:41:56,220 --> 01:41:57,500
You think they'll draw for us?

1752
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:02,820
We can tell them that there's like a hacker in our lobby.

1753
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:06,680
Yeah, just like threaten them.

1754
01:42:06,780 --> 01:42:07,940
Be like, draw our DDoS.

1755
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:10,240
Draw our DDoS.

1756
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:11,360
Holy shit.

1757
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:20,680
It was just not meant to be.

1758
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:26,200
Maybe you can do what they did to us, John.

1759
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:30,680
Yeah, they're not even trying.

1760
01:42:32,700 --> 01:42:33,320
Damn.

1761
01:42:33,940 --> 01:42:34,560
That's rough.

1762
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:42,800
This is like Geo Meester.

1763
01:42:44,060 --> 01:42:46,780
I tried to keep you up.

1764
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:57,020
Yeah, we gotta get that 50-50 average for Marvel Rivals.

1765
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:03,560
Some guys just...

1766
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:07,100
Some games are just not meant to be.

1767
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:20,420
That was... wow.

1768
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:22,240
What a game.

1769
01:43:23,180 --> 01:43:27,000
I've never seen...

1770
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:36,140
This is literally the first time I've ever seen anybody fall for the fucking portal thing.

1771
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:41,060
I've never seen that before in high elo.

1772
01:43:41,420 --> 01:43:45,440
This is literally the first time I've seen this in high elo.

1773
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:47,600
That's fucking crazy.

1774
01:43:50,540 --> 01:43:53,020
That's actually crazy.

1775
01:43:53,660 --> 01:43:57,140
No, that was one game after Post Rocket.

1776
01:43:57,320 --> 01:43:58,560
What do you mean?

1777
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:01,640
It was literally one game after.

1778
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:07,700
Hey, I see a mace.

1779
01:44:08,140 --> 01:44:08,440
Alright.

1780
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:10,260
Let's see.

1781
01:44:10,740 --> 01:44:12,740
Wait, is he... are they three stacking still?

1782
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:15,120
Let's see.

1783
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:16,260
I can... don't worry.

1784
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:17,100
I'll do something.

1785
01:44:17,380 --> 01:44:18,520
I'll do a little trick.

1786
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:20,760
That I know.

1787
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:22,160
No, they have to be, right?

1788
01:44:23,180 --> 01:44:25,260
I wonder if they Q-Dodge right after.

1789
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:27,620
Alright, see a mace.

1790
01:44:28,120 --> 01:44:30,820
See a mace and buy them back to...

1791
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:32,340
I don't know.

1792
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:33,360
I don't know if it's worth...

1793
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:35,340
I did say like, today's not the day.

1794
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:37,500
We have to go again tomorrow, guys.

1795
01:44:37,780 --> 01:44:38,840
How long have I been streaming for?

1796
01:44:40,280 --> 01:44:41,720
How long have I been streaming for?

1797
01:44:42,440 --> 01:44:43,680
An hour and 44 minutes?

1798
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:45,920
Oh my god, that's a very short rival stream.

1799
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:47,360
That's a...

1800
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:50,080
That's a very...

1801
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:52,480
A very short rival stream.

1802
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:54,400
Yeah, we'll grind long tomorrow.

1803
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:55,980
We'll do a... I mean...

1804
01:44:55,980 --> 01:44:57,420
Yeah, we'll do a longer grind tomorrow.

1805
01:44:57,700 --> 01:45:00,220
We can do a longer grind tomorrow.

1806
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:02,720
Yeah, but we're positive.

1807
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,680
Yeah, we went positive here.

1808
01:45:06,580 --> 01:45:08,780
I mean, we don't talk about this game.

1809
01:45:08,900 --> 01:45:11,120
But we won one, two, three games.

1810
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:12,580
And we're up...

1811
01:45:12,580 --> 01:45:14,660
We're technically up two games right now.

1812
01:45:14,820 --> 01:45:15,160
Technically.

1813
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:16,360
So...

1814
01:45:16,360 --> 01:45:18,380
Yeah, I'm able to stop, guys.

1815
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:20,880
But yeah, that was fun.

1816
01:45:21,220 --> 01:45:22,100
That was a fun time.

1817
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:23,640
This game was fucking...

1818
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:24,500
This game was weird.

1819
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:27,520
This game was also weird.

1820
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:28,780
This game was weird, but we won.

1821
01:45:29,140 --> 01:45:31,280
This game was weird, but like...

1822
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:31,880
We lost.

1823
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:34,020
And like, honestly, we deserve to lose that.

1824
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:36,140
We really...

1825
01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:41,460
Even when you're massively losing.

1826
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:43,840
Cause like...

1827
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:45,100
Why should I get tilted?

1828
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:47,540
Like, if I get tilted, I lose more.

1829
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:49,620
So like, it's just GG's go next.

1830
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:51,540
I'm literally playing with a guy who...

1831
01:45:51,540 --> 01:45:53,180
Who was rank one.

1832
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:56,600
Like, how would I be sad?

1833
01:46:04,220 --> 01:46:07,480
Also, you know why I'm not fucking mad when losing?

1834
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:09,260
Cause I went through hell.

1835
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:13,800
I went through some fucking lost streak hell.

1836
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:17,100
So like, this is nothing to me.

1837
01:46:18,940 --> 01:46:21,520
Like, that shit is nothing to me.

1838
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:23,080
Anyway.

1839
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:25,140
Anyway, guys.

1840
01:46:25,980 --> 01:46:27,120
Thank you all for coming.

1841
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:29,240
I'm gonna call it for today.

1842
01:46:29,420 --> 01:46:30,680
Because I wanna do a longer...

1843
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:32,780
Longer stream tomorrow.

1844
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:34,620
I don't know if Mace is gonna be there tomorrow.

1845
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:37,780
Cause his schedule is all over the fucking place.

1846
01:46:38,180 --> 01:46:41,300
But I definitely wanna do a longer stream tomorrow of Marvel Rivals.

1847
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:42,860
So if he...

1848
01:46:42,860 --> 01:46:44,680
I don't know what his schedule is like.

1849
01:46:44,740 --> 01:46:47,300
But I could try and find others to play with tomorrow too.

1850
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:50,420
Around the same time, like I said, I don't know.

1851
01:46:51,540 --> 01:46:51,900
I don't know.

1852
01:46:51,900 --> 01:46:55,960
I don't know what the time is.

1853
01:46:56,360 --> 01:46:58,480
It's always very random.

1854
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:01,020
But...

1855
01:47:01,020 --> 01:47:03,300
Don't camp in my chat.

1856
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:05,560
I feel really bad, guys.

1857
01:47:05,900 --> 01:47:07,900
Like, if I say like, tomorrow I'm gonna play Rivals.

1858
01:47:08,120 --> 01:47:12,200
And then like, I see all you guys waiting in chat for so long.

1859
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:13,100
And I'm sorry.

1860
01:47:13,220 --> 01:47:14,440
I'm so sorry.

1861
01:47:15,060 --> 01:47:17,680
Just go in tomorrow thinking I'm not streaming.

1862
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:18,200
Okay?

1863
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:18,960
Just...

1864
01:47:20,360 --> 01:47:22,960
If I stream on Twitch, it's a surprise.

1865
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:29,620
I feel so bad seeing you guys just camping out.

1866
01:47:30,020 --> 01:47:32,460
Just like, pitching a tent in my chat.

1867
01:47:32,620 --> 01:47:33,760
And just be like...

1868
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:34,960
Work first, Doki.

1869
01:47:36,620 --> 01:47:40,100
Hey, guys.

1870
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:41,440
Thank you all for coming.

1871
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:42,680
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

1872
01:47:42,980 --> 01:47:43,440
Pause your check.

1873
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:44,080
Get up and move around.

1874
01:47:44,460 --> 01:47:46,520
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

1875
01:47:46,620 --> 01:47:47,820
Because you deserve it.

1876
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:49,400
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

1877
01:47:49,640 --> 01:47:50,300
Bye, guys.

1878
01:47:50,620 --> 01:47:50,980
Bye.
