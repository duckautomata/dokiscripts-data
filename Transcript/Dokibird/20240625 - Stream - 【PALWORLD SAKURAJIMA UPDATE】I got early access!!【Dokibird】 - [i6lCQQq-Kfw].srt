00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,080
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,160
Oh my god it's so weird!

3
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:00,060
Oh, our very first stream with our new skin suit, guys.

4
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,100
Oh, it feels a little bit weird to be honest.

5
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:11,040
I was trying to figure out how big should I be on the screen.

6
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,020
I don't know.

7
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,160
I don't know.

8
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,240
I was trying to figure it out.

9
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:25,520
Alright, so we have a lot of updates and stuff.

10
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:31,460
I know the intro is still not updated yet.

11
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,200
It's actually done.

12
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,720
But I am trying to figure out what color background to use.

13
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,020
So it's either going to be a different background or it's going to be a different color.

14
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,880
It's going to be the same.

15
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,100
But it is done.

16
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,300
And I basically hibernated for 24 hours after the debut.

17
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,780
I was just... I was gone.

18
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:49,800
I can't...

19
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,040
After the... after the like, uh, re-debut, I was out.

20
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,100
I was actually like brain dead.

21
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,620
Like I couldn't.

22
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,640
I was so tired.

23
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,760
I like woke up from my sleep and I was so mentally just drained.

24
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,540
Because all the stress.

25
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,520
And like all the preparations that kept inside.

26
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,220
It was like, it's over.

27
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,980
And then like it all cop up to me.

28
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,660
And I'm like, this would be how I felt if I didn't hold it in.

29
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,640
I was just... I was like talking to my staff team today.

30
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,060
I was talking to my... like we had a meeting.

31
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,640
And then I was like, I'm so tired.

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,520
They were like, you're so tired.

33
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:36,880
I was like, I'm so tired.

34
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,980
I was like, I'm so tired.

35
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,760
They were like, alright, we gotta do this.

36
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,800
We gotta do that.

37
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,520
And they're like, are you okay, doki?

38
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,020
And I'm like, I'm so tired.

39
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,620
So I was just like, okay, I'm...

40
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,920
I can't... I need a... I need... I need a rest.

41
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,900
I'm... I know everybody's watching me because the debut was so successful.

42
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,520
But I need a sleep.

43
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,960
I... I need to slow down now.

44
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,700
I'm tired.

45
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,520
But I... I...

46
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:24,180
I really, really, really wanted to try out the early access.

47
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,900
The early access for the newest big update for PAL World.

48
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,180
Was it called the Sakura Gima...

49
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,600
The Sakura Gima update.

50
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:39,800
Because Hiro messaged me and was like, Hey, I have early access.

51
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,320
I have a... I have early access.

52
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,380
Do you want to check it out?

53
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,100
Do you want to stream it?

54
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,680
And I was like, oh my god.

55
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,560
You know, because like, she has early access for two days.

56
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,860
So I was just like, okay, doki.

57
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,540
I know today you promised behind the scenes.

58
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:02,340
But then, but early access is the only time to be like, I have early access and you don't.

59
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,260
No, doki.

60
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,180
I want to be like, alright, I want to show you guys.

61
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,720
The early access for the new PAL.

62
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,200
Because I know, I know some of you guys would be like, PAL World.

63
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,340
Oh my god.

64
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,260
We watched so much PAL World.

65
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,280
But no, this is different.

66
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,780
This is new content.

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,060
This is new content PAL World.

68
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,380
So there's things you've never seen before this time.

69
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,260
So it's...

70
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,380
And I never got to stream PAL World for you guys.

71
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,240
I never.

72
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,060
Yeah, you might have watched a hundred thousand other people play PAL World.

73
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,340
But you never watch doki play PAL World.

74
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:49,620
And I, compared to the other people that played PAL World, they don't have early access like me.

75
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,460
So you have to watch this stream.

76
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,800
But yes, I...

77
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,900
Oh, yeah, sorry.

78
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,620
I forgot about Twitch.

79
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:06,360
Yeah, but you know, some YouTubers, YouTube people don't watch Twitch and they don't know the existence.

80
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,160
But I do.

81
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,020
And I also forgot about my Twitch VOD channel.

82
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,660
So Madrid, a lot of people, a lot of Dragos did not watch me play PAL World.

83
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:19,180
And this is PAL World on my YouTube channel that you weren't able to...

84
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,660
Yeah, it's a tournament chat.

85
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,900
It was different.

86
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,200
Stakes were high.

87
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,820
Tensions were high.

88
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,980
People were yelling at each other.

89
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,100
Now instead I'm just gonna yell at you instead.

90
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:30,660
Instead!

91
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,900
Yeah, but it was a clip compilation!

92
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,560
That is different!

93
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,940
A clip compilation is not a real thing!

94
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,540
Because there's no social interaction by being live on chat!

95
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,340
I'm sorry for the vodwatchers, but we can pretend I'm live for you if you're vodwatching right now.

96
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:01,860
We can pretend that we're live together if you're vodwatching right now.

97
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,600
Anyway!

98
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,080
As I was saying...

99
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:14,280
So, I really wanted to stream the early access because in two days, it wouldn't be early access.

100
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,860
So that's why I was like, okay, I gotta stream early access before everybody has access to it.

101
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:30,140
Other than that, I'm definitely gonna take it much more chill.

102
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,980
I know I still have three streams for the week.

103
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,080
This one, and then Chain Together with RPR and Ditto.

104
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,820
Which might be a very terrible idea.

105
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,800
Because I don't know how bad the ping's gonna be.

106
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,580
What server we're gonna be playing Chain Together.

107
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,540
And we have to be in sync while everybody has...

108
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,440
while one of us is gonna have 200 ping.

109
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,620
So...

110
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:18,120
I don't know how it's gonna go when, you know, one of us is gonna go in with 200 to 300 ping playing a game that requires synchronization of jumps.

111
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,100
So, we're gonna be like 3, 2, 1, jump.

112
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,960
One of us has to jump at 2.

113
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,160
So, this might have been a little bit of a very terrible idea.

114
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,620
Umm...

115
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,660
When it's already a rage baiting game.

116
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,460
And then we have the behind the scenes.

117
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,240
I know I said I was gonna put it earlier.

118
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,180
But like I said, a lot of things moved around.

119
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:52,560
And it lets the team have a chance to put together all the things they want me to talk about during the behind the scenes.

120
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,740
But yes, shout out to the project team.

121
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,200
Umm... we had a little celebration right after.

122
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,160
Umm... it was a great pleasure working with everybody there.

123
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:10,680
And we are actually gonna upload a director's cut of the whole debut video.

124
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,100
We're gonna have a director's cut.

125
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,460
Cause there was some cut content.

126
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,200
A little bit of cut content in there.

127
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,140
And we wanna like brush it up a lot more.

128
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:27,560
So, you get like deleted content and also the adjusting the sound, balancing, adding more sound effects and everything.

129
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,900
Fixing it all up.

130
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,920
Tidying it all up.

131
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,380
So, a director's cut will be will be uploaded in the future.

132
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,380
Umm...

133
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,220
Anyway, Blade, thank you for the magenta soup!

134
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,760
Thank you, thank you!

135
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,620
Clip, clip, clip!

136
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,520
Out of context!

137
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,080
Thank you for the magenta soup!

138
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,640
Thank you, thank you!

139
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,160
Oh my god, I'm so bouncy.

140
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,200
Now you guys can actually see me actually I actually move around a lot when I talk.

141
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,280
But you guys never really see that.

142
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,420
I'm so self conscious cause now you actually see me.

143
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:07,080
I'm like a very... I like to... if you guys see like my hand tracking too, I actually talk with my hands as well.

144
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,360
So like...

145
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,900
I'm so bouncy.

146
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,940
Oh my gosh.

147
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,700
It's weird.

148
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,080
I've never... I've never like...

149
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:24,320
I'm not used to having you guys see how bouncy I actually am when I'm when I'm talking.

150
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,860
Umm... It's a... It's a...

151
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,160
unique experience for sure.

152
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,440
Okay, I have to tell you guys a funny story.

153
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,800
So like... I...

154
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,700
I thought that...

155
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:43,800
Umm... For Pal World when they said New World Also, Lima thank you for the 50 gifted chips!

156
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,800
Thank you, thank you!

157
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,300
I really appreciate it.

158
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,220
Thank you so much!

159
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,200
Umm...

160
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,660
But when they said...

161
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:59,140
It's like New World I legitimately thought like we were gonna be transported into like an entire new map.

162
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,260
But no.

163
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,660
It adds on to the map.

164
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,340
And then so... Umm...

165
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:06,900
So...

166
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,960
Very funny story.

167
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,320
I was very confused.

168
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,200
Cause I was like...

169
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,720
Oh Hiro... Umm...

170
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,960
Where is this place?

171
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,640
And they were like...

172
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,040
Oh just run north west and you'll get there.

173
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,000
So I was like...

174
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,580
Oh okay.

175
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,580
So the thing is...

176
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,040
I'm starting a whole new world because I never...

177
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,140
I... Umm...

178
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:28,860
I...

179
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,560
I didn't have a world yet.

180
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,600
So the thing is...

181
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,040
I started a whole new world.

182
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,200
And...

183
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,380
Umm...

184
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,580
I got in.

185
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,380
I was like... I wanted to see if I could find it.

186
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,520
Before I start the stream.

187
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,900
So at least we can...

188
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,360
We hadn't cut the time of me finding it on stream.

189
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,980
So I was like...

190
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:55,380
I had level 1 trying to fucking run to find this new area.

191
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,980
And then I had to swim.

192
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:57,900
Because she was like...

193
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,620
North West.

194
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,620
Little do I know...

195
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,320
It was not just North West.

196
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,660
And...

197
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,440
I will give you like...

198
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,160
An illustrated...

199
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,940
Like... I was like... Hiro...

200
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,220
Can you like... Circle it on the map?

201
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,040
What do you mean...

202
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,040
North West?

203
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,240
And then...

204
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,860
She sent me...

205
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,120
She sent me the map.

206
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,340
I was like...

207
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,640
I was never gonna make it.

208
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,140
By just running.

209
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,700
I looked at it and I was like...

210
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,400
I was never...

211
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,300
What do you mean...

212
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,640
Just run...

213
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,660
North West?

214
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,000
What do you...

215
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,100
I know how to get there though.

216
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:41,740
I know...

217
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,100
How to get there.

218
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,200
Alright we are gonna name a new world.

219
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,260
Let's do Dragoon Islands.

220
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,480
We will do Dragoon Islands.

221
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,320
And...

222
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:54,900
And then...

223
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,400
We have to turn multiplayer on.

224
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,140
And we will do...

225
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,620
I think that is fine.

226
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,700
I don't really care about like...

227
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,840
I mean we can make the night time faster.

228
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:06,800
You know what?

229
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,540
We will make it...

230
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,060
Fifteen...

231
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:17,740
Alright...

232
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,700
And then...

233
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,920
There is a reason!

234
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,460
There is a...

235
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,060
There is a reason...

236
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:24,620
No no guys.

237
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,160
Okay.

238
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,220
There is a reason.

239
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,000
Okay we don't need that much...

240
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,920
Night time.

241
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,300
Like what are we gonna do at night?

242
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,200
There is a reason!

243
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,320
No you have...

244
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,680
No there is a reason.

245
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,180
I will show you guys why.

246
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:44,840
Why?

247
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,560
Okay give me a...

248
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,740
Guys there is a reason.

249
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,720
You know...

250
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,160
Fifteen to twenty you are right.

251
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,060
Let's just get a good middle ground.

252
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,260
Guys...

253
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,100
Let me give you...

254
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,080
Guys I have a reason why I did this.

255
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,840
There is...

256
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,180
No I swear to God.

257
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,520
I swear to God.

258
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,460
There is a reason why guys.

259
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,740
I swear.

260
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,020
And I will show you why.

261
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,240
When I am in.

262
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,400
Um...

263
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,140
I figured out why.

264
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,940
I figured out why.

265
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,200
Alright.

266
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,040
Let's do a classic.

267
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:32,700
Okay.

268
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,360
Uh...

269
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,340
And then...

270
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,280
What was it?

271
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,140
Oh yeah there we go.

272
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,500
There we go.

273
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,220
Bringing back...

274
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,040
Twitch rivals Doki.

275
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,940
I think I was like this face right?

276
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,560
Or was it...

277
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:53,700
Oh no.

278
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,480
It was this one.

279
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,960
And then it was...

280
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,820
Which pupil was it?

281
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,180
It was... I think it was a normal pupil.

282
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,700
We have more of a teal color.

283
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,560
Uh...

284
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,580
Maybe like...

285
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,340
Was it this?

286
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,660
Is that my eye color now?

287
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,200
I don't remember.

288
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,020
It was like this.

289
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:12,760
Yeah there you go.

290
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,280
That's my eye color now.

291
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,540
And then blonde...

292
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,540
Oh God.

293
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,960
I am so bad with colors.

294
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,540
There we go.

295
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,580
So you know it's all natural.

296
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,140
I didn't dye my hair.

297
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,760
So you know...

298
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,460
It's all natural.

299
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,340
There was no hair color dye.

300
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,940
Oh this is harder.

301
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,000
Cause like there's no actual like...

302
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,120
My hairstyle this time around.

303
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,720
So it is a little more difficult.

304
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,180
Cause I'm like which ones...

305
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,700
Which one... Is this my hairstyle?

306
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,540
I guess.

307
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,560
I guess.

308
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,120
Or is it this?

309
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,500
Is this my hairstyle?

310
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,760
I guess.

311
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,320
Right?

312
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,840
I feel like this is much more of my hairstyle.

313
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,200
I wish I could just copy the color that I...

314
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,880
I wish I could just copy the color that I...

315
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,400
Uh... That I put in there.

316
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,480
Okay there you go.

317
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,760
And it has like less like that.

318
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,940
Yeah I think that's good.

319
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,140
I think...

320
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,980
I think that's good.

321
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,240
Huh.

322
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,200
Alright.

323
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,200
Yeah let's just go with average.

324
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,140
Okay there we go.

325
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,180
Uh... Oh shit.

326
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,480
Real female doki.

327
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,440
I think I was just doki bird.

328
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,140
I think.

329
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:28,680
Okay.

330
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,100
Uh... Maybe I should do...

331
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,700
Real female doki.

332
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,280
There you go.

333
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,560
So you guys will know.

334
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,660
You know it's me.

335
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,300
Alright.

336
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,660
I'll show you guys why.

337
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,040
Eating all those crabby patties.

338
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,040
Okay we all don't even see the intro.

339
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,220
We've seen this intro like...

340
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,020
10 million different times.

341
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,900
Okay so...

342
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,580

343
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,180
I... Okay so...

344
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:52,720
Guys.

345
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,540
This is...

346
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,260
This is where we're at.

347
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:55,760
Right?

348
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:00,880
So...

349
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,380
This is where we're at.

350
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,100
Okay?

351
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,480
So...

352
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,960
And then...

353
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,220
My friend...

354
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:13,780
She...

355
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,780
She...

356
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,240
She licked me the mat.

357
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,560
And it's all the way on the top left.

358
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,480
And it's all the way on the top left.

359
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:24,620
And it's all the way on the top left.

360
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,180
Do you want to know where we are?

361
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,640
I'll show you where we are.

362
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,960
On the map guys.

363
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,620
For those who are like... But where are we doki?

364
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,660
Where are we you say?

365
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,440
We are here.

366
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,980
That's where we are.

367
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,580
So I was like...

368
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,000
And then...

369
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,620
And the hero was like...

370
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,120
Run north west.

371
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,360
That was...

372
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,680
That was my instructions.

373
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,480
So I was like...

374
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,180
Okay.

375
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,740
And then I was like...

376
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,380
I can't find it.

377
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,800
I can't find it.

378
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,500
And the hero was like...

379
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,600
Oh don't worry I got the map.

380
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,620
It's here.

381
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,560
It's...

382
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,700
I just thought it was so funny.

383
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,880
And the hero was like...

384
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,980
Oh yeah by the way you have to die and respawn.

385
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,160
You have to...

386
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,960
You have to respawn.

387
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,340
But I didn't know.

388
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,380
I...

389
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,060
I should have asked for more instructions.

390
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,900
Oh my god.

391
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,000
I didn't know.

392
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,580
So the plan is...

393
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,580
Is that we have to die.

394
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,040
And then...

395
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,180
We...

396
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,940
After we die...

397
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,560
We go to top left.

398
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,240
We go here.

399
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,640
This is where we are guys.

400
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,180
We...

401
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,500
Have to respawn...

402
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:06,960
Here.

403
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,120
And then...

404
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,940
After you respawn...

405
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,780
You see that?

406
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,340
That's the place.

407
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,020
Over there.

408
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,020
There it is.

409
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,220
Over there.

410
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,520
That's our new place.

411
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,120
That we have to go.

412
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,380
It's all the way over there.

413
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,100
Okay.

414
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,560
Up the volume a little bit too.

415
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,460
Whoops sorry I almost doxxed you.

416
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,200

417
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,920

418
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,620
Alright.

419
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,060

00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,180

Oh it's so clear.

423
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,720
I don't think they know this guys.

424
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,080
Sound guy.

425
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,880
I don't think they know this sound guy.

426
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,200
It could be anybody.

427
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,900
Anybody's name starts with A.

428
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,700
You know?

429
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,080
Alright.

430
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,500
Alright here we go.

431
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,540
Guys I need to heal up a little bit before I start swimming.

432
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,500
I know I have these muscular legs.

433
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,860
But like...

434
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,400
I died one time.

435
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,620
Trying to swim all the way there.

436
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,080
I need to like...

437
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,560
Self heal a little bit.

438
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,260
Alright here we go.

439
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,040
Okay I realize that my endurance is...

440
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,780
Okay I almost forgot.

441
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,760
We have to go up here.

442
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,540
We have to go...

443
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,500
All the way up here.

444
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,980
And then...

445
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,380
Jump over here.

446
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,200
And then swim.

447
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,360
And then...

448
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,200
We swim.

449
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,080
Yeah his name is Audio Guy.

450
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:02,700
Chat.

451
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,400
Alright there we go.

452
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:08,000
That's how you go to Sakura Jima.

453
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,940
Mushroom area.

454
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,520
That's how you get there.

455
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,260
See there's a reason why I have to wait until I like...

456
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:15,980
Like had like...

457
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,080
Regen my HP because I already lost my stamina.

458
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,160
And there you go!

459
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,080
I got a mushroom and I leveled up!

460
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,200
Yay!

461
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,080
Alright let me...

462
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,360
Push up the audio a little bit more.

463
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,000
I think there's like a...

464
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,040
I push up the audio too.

465
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,040
Alright nice.

466
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,140
Okay so I'm pretty sure you can...

467
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,020
Edit the sound.

468
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:35,700
I haven't...

469
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,540
Right?

470
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:36,940
Yeah.

471
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,300
Is there anything we need to edit?

472
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,080
Uh...

473
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,540
Audio... whoops.

474
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,100
Wait.

475
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,520
What did I press?

476
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,700
Why are my eyes sparkling?

477
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:45,860
What?

478
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,060
I don't even know what...

479
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,200
I don't even know what I pressed.

480
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:52,640
I don't even know what I pressed.

481
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,780
Okay I need to make sure...

482
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,060
Oh shit okay.

483
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,400
Okay we definitely don't need...

484
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,760
Okay guys I did not look at my settings.

485
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,960
I did not...

486
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,000
Okay no camera shake.

487
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,820
I don't know if you guys noticed but I...

488
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,980
I did not look at my settings at all.

489
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,660
Alright here we go.

490
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,600
And then game settings, toggle, sprint, on, off.

491
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:12,920
Okay.

492
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,220
Let's get the sensitivity...

493
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,520
A little bit low.

494
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,860
And we should be...

495
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,360
Good.

496
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,420
Alright bring down...

497
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,580
Bring the ambient sound...

498
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,260
Down a little bit.

499
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,640
Alright uh...

500
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,740
Ambient.

501
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,960
I'll put it at 70 and I'll...

502
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,920
Bring this up.

503
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,860
Alright let me know if it's better.

504
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:33,680
Alright.

505
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:36,660
Okay.

506
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,500
Let me fix my...

507
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,120
Thing.

508
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,120
How do I... Oh my gosh.

509
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,420
How do I um...

510
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,360
Oh that's my clip.

511
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,080
Guys I don't remember anything.

512
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,920
That's my glasses.

513
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,280
Oh no.

514
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,100
Give me a sec.

515
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,180
I don't remember anything.

516
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,480
Those...

517
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,980
Those are my glasses.

518
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,420
I don't need to wear my glasses.

519
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,020
Okay I set it all up.

520
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,760
On a little...

521
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,900
On a little device.

522
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,440
Guys I'm still learning guys.

523
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,480
I'm not used to having so many things.

524
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,260
It's... It's weird.

525
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,960
It's so weird.

526
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:19,740
Alright.

527
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,620
There we go.

528
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,660
Now I have my eyes again.

529
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,260
Alright.

530
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,640
I have... Alright.

531
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,820
And now we're here!

532
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:28,920
Look!

533
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,280
And this is the reason why I had to level up.

534
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,200
I need to level up really fast.

535
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,960
They're level 45.

536
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,840
This is a... This...

537
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,680
Area...

538
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:41,780
This...

539
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,500
Area...

540
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,600
It's... It's a...

541
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,580
They're very high level.

542
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:52,300
So what happened was that I was minding my own business.

543
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,540
Exploring the area.

544
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,980
Cause I was like oh okay.

545
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,620
I should like figure this out.

546
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,200
You know?

547
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,620
I was like oh I should like...

548
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:06,200
I should know what's going on before like know how to get here.

549
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,020
You know like find the first...

550
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,240
Find the first area that has like the checkpoint.

551
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:11,940
The...

552
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,560
That has...

553
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,120
We're friends right?

554
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,200
Yeah they're little pussy.

555
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,000
They're little bitches too.

556
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,840
So you don't have to worry about these guys.

557
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:23,960
They're...

558
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,180
They're very afraid of you.

559
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:34,600
But I bumped into a clan of enemies that were not afraid of me.

560
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,120
And um...

561
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,640
And I was like oh they're pretty cute.

562
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,840
Look at those frogs!

563
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:51,200
And then I looked at these frogs and they turned around and beat my ass.

564
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,060
It literally took one hit and I was gone.

565
00:24:55,380 --> 00:25:04,700
So for those who are gonna go to Sakurajima, do not get near the frogs.

566
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,520
Do not get near the frogs.

567
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,760
The frogs will kill you.

568
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,540
So be careful of the frogs.

569
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,180
They will absolutely kill you.

570
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,040
Literally one hit me and I was gone.

571
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,600
I got jumped on by the frog mafia.

572
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,460
I was like, oh cute, there's those frogs!

573
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,560
And then there I go.

574
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,900
I was gone.

575
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,840
I wish I still had my old world.

576
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,500
.

577
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:56,000
Oh yeah, and apparently, if I knew, I would have brought my old world into the beta.

578
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,020
So at least I think I was like level 30 in my old world.

579
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,840
So yeah, we're starting back at zero.

580
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,820
And that is why!

581
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,600
That is...

582
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,240
No I can't.

583
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,280
It's gone forever.

584
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:19,260
That is why we had to set up the XP leveling up thing.

585
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,400
Okay.

586
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:23,960
Look at him.

587
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,300
Look he's such a...

588
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:25,340
Oh!

589
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,540
Okay, I didn't think he'd actually chase me.

590
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,260
No please.

591
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,220
No please.

592
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,900
Someone in my chat said to hit you and I thought it would be funny!

593
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,300
Okay, we're fine.

594
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:39,580
Okay, we're fine.

595
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,080
We're okay.

596
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:44,280
Yeah, do not hit a level 46 dinosaur despite what your...

597
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,220
What your inner thoughts are telling you.

598
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,260
What your intrusive thoughts say.

599
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,100
Do not...

600
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,720
Do not try to beat up a...

601
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,600
Level 46.

602
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,180
.

603
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,560
I'm trying to find the first checkpoint!

604
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,000
It's like somewhere here.

605
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,040
I found it before!

606
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,060
It was like...

607
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:07,740
Here.

608
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,860
Okay, there's a lot.

609
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,700
There's a lot going on.

610
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,040
Oh, but I found an effigy though.

611
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,220
Let's go!

612
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:16,880
Ah...

613
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,180
Alright.

614
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,240
Here we go.

615
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,300
Where?

616
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,620
Where do we go?

617
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:23,680
Oh, there it is!

618
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,080
There it is!

619
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:24,460
There it is!

620
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,860
The first... the first checkpoint!

621
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:26,960
The first checkpoint.

622
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,640
Ah...

623
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:29,920
Alright.

624
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:30,680
It's fine.

625
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:30,980
See?

626
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,260
Nothing to worry about.

627
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:35,360
There's apparently a lot of new pals as well.

628
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,620
And there's like...

629
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,920
There's like treasure...

630
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,940
There's like an oil rig.

631
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,840
And you can actually get oil now.

632
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,500
And there's like oil strongholds and everything.

633
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,500
And then there's like...

634
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,380
These are the frogs over there.

635
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,460
Whatever they're not called.

636
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,600
The Krojiro.

637
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,280
Be careful of the Krojiro.

638
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,080
They are not friendly.

639
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,680
If you're like even like 5 centimeters...

640
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,260
See?

641
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:57,640
Look!

642
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:58,680
Look!

643
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,940
Oh shit!

644
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:00,660
.

645
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:08,970
.

646
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,490
They just... they don't care.

647
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,830
I just wanted to be friendly.

648
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,270
Look, I leveled up though.

649
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,630
I'm level 4 now.

650
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:01,010
I'm just a baby.

651
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:09,570
I didn't realize... okay, that was a little bit of my fault because I didn't realize...

652
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:12,770
I didn't realize the range of that fucking attack.

653
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:14,630
I'm gonna get my shit back though.

654
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:18,290
I need to get to the checkpoint over there before anything happens.

655
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,170
I need to get to the checkpoint.

656
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,250
I need to at least claim the checkpoint.

657
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,290
That's all I want.

658
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:31,650
Please, I just... I just want only 41 more levels to go.

659
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:35,370
I just wanted to claim the checkpoint.

660
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,650
That's really it.

661
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:40,470
I just wanted to claim it.

662
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,970
Oh my god.

663
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,190
Okay, don't worry.

664
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:46,850
It's gonna be fine.

665
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,090
It's gonna be fine.

666
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,570
I just wanted to explore.

667
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,070
Oh no, it's getting dark.

668
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,770
I don't know what type of pals show up in the dark.

669
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:57,890
But there's apparently like a... a new type of...

670
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,170
A new type of currency.

671
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,530
Where... look at them run.

672
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:05,570
That's right.

673
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:06,470
Run.

674
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:10,870
That's fucking right.

675
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:11,930
Get out of here.

676
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,130
Get out of here.

677
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:15,030
That's right.

678
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:15,830
Yeah.

679
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,270
Yeah, you're afraid of me?

680
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:17,950
Oh no.

681
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:21,670
These fucking... I trained very hard to get these legs.

682
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,930
No, there's a new form of PAL that's... Oh my god.

683
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:28,450
Oh my god.

684
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,210
I tied so far.

685
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,590
There's a... Oh my god.

686
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:33,430
Fuck this though.

687
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:36,890
Let me put these... Okay.

688
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:37,870
Alright.

689
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:41,830
There's a new form of PALS that holds currency.

690
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:44,410
That you have to capture or kill.

691
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:45,250
I'm not sure.

692
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:48,550
But I was reading up on like... the... the new stuff.

693
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:49,930
So like to see if I can get there.

694
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,070
Um...

695
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:54,410
And basically it's like...

696
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,350
It's so weird.

697
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:56,890
It's like... it's called DogCoin.

698
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:00,230
I think they were trying to make a parody of DogeCoin.

699
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:02,270
And it... Oh, rest in peace by the way.

700
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,470
I don't know if you guys know this but like...

701
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,910
The... the... the...

702
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:08,150
Doge finally passed away.

703
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,790
After 20 plus years.

704
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,990
And I'm... Oh my god.

705
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:13,490
Like...

706
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,990
I was like... I was just like...

707
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,670
Rest in peace cause...

708
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:21,610
Cause like... He was... She was like blind death.

709
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,410
And had to wear diapers.

710
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:25,550
And I was just like... Oh my god.

711
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,490
Like I was just like...

712
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:28,650
Oh my god.

713
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,530
She can finally be at peace.

714
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,310
Oh my god.

715
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,390
Like... Anyway.

716
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:36,870
Um...

717
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,910
She was really...

718
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,530
Really old.

719
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:43,750
Also... I am... I don't know where to go.

720
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,050
Uh...

721
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,670
Oh no.

722
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:47,090
Okay.

723
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,570
Uh... Anyway.

724
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:49,710
Uh... I was surprised.

725
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:51,130
I didn't realize...

726
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:51,310
No.

727
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:52,490
I can't see.

728
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:53,410
I...

729
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:54,650
Yeah.

730
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,210
She was very well loved.

731
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,010
She was kept...

732
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,650
I was so surprised finding out.

733
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,230
Guys.

734
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,090
I fucked up.

735
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:03,030
I... I don't know where I...

736
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:03,790
I...

737
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,930
I don't know.

738
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,710
Oh no.

739
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,170
I so...

740
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:10,430
Oh no.

741
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,390
This is bad.

742
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,030
Okay.

743
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,610
Do I have a torch?

744
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,590
Do I have a...

745
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,890
Where am I?

746
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,150
Where am I?

747
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,290
It's just the swamp.

748
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,310
It's only the swamp.

749
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,450
I need a go to.

750
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:23,770
Oh it's over here.

751
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:24,990
I see the blue light.

752
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:26,470
I see my items.

753
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:27,390
Anyway.

754
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:30,010
Uh... They... They did like dog coin.

755
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,470
In this game.

756
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,250
And... Um...

757
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:35,910
And...

758
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:38,050
And like a pair... It's like a form of currency.

759
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,930
Where you can buy...

760
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:40,970
Palskins.

761
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,390
Uh... And I don't remember.

762
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,990
I don't really remember much about it.

763
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:45,410
It was like...

764
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:47,870
You can buy Palskins and...

765
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:49,170
Uh...

766
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:49,590
Okay.

767
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:50,690
I need like a...

768
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:51,890
Oh no.

769
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,550
I hear the frog.

770
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:54,430
Oh no.

771
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,810
I hear the frog.

772
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:56,290
He's angry.

773
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,390
The frog's angry.

774
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:58,410
Please leave me alone.

775
00:32:58,650 --> 00:32:59,790
Please leave me alone.

776
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:02,010
I just... I just want to...

777
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,070
Get my items back.

778
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:04,990
Leave me alone.

779
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:08,980
Yeah.

780
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,980
But there's no poison though.

781
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,620
So that's good.

782
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,720
Oh thank god.

783
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,440
He's sleeping.

784
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,620
Oh shit.

785
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,040
What the fuck is that?

786
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,460
Oh I don't want to look back to see I'm level one.

787
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,300
I'm level five.

788
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,120
Well I don't know why I paused there.

789
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,820
I should not be turning around.

790
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,360
Just to see what they are.

791
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,080
Dude fuck those frogs though.

792
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,640
I hate these frogs.

793
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,800
All my homies hate those frogs.

794
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,840
Alright and...

795
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,720
Is that my items?

796
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,160
Is that it?

797
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,880
Oh thank god.

798
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,860
At least you don't get...

799
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,280
Poisoned.

800
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,740
I'm so happy.

801
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,900
Thank fucking god there's no...

802
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,060
Oh!

803
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,540
Are they friendly?

804
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:47,820
Hello?

805
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,400
Hello?

806
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,080
Hello?

807
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,760
Oh no.

808
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,180
Oh no.

809
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:55,240
Oh okay.

810
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:55,640
Oh no.

811
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,440
He's running.

812
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:00,000
Oh shit!

813
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,000
Oh shit!

814
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,330
Guess they're not friendly.

815
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:14,390
Guess they're not friendly.

816
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,290
My...

817
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:34,600
I'm cold.

818
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,320
I'm cold.

819
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,240
I'm starving.

820
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,500
And I'm dying.

821
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,540
I'm dying.

822
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:48,680
I just wanted to say hi.

823
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,600
I just wanted to say hi.

824
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,360
I don't understand.

825
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:56,900
I just wanted to say hi.

826
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,920
The green ones were friendly.

827
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,400
The green ones were friendly.

828
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,640
The...

829
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,120
The green ones were friendly.

830
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,820
Why was this one not friendly?

831
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:09,820
Why was this one not friendly?

832
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,760
I'm gonna take my anger out on you.

833
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,140
Ugh.

834
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,340
That's fucking right.

835
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,240
That's fucking right.

836
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,120
I'm gonna take my anger off of you.

837
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,860
I get bullied.

838
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,320
So you get bullied.

839
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,220
It's a fucking cycle.

840
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,380
Where are you trying to go?

841
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,940
That's right.

842
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,880
I'm not breaking the cycle.

843
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,600
Alright.

844
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,120
Nice.

845
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,420
I'm still cold.

846
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,760
So I'm gonna get Mooch off this guy's fire.

847
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,420
To be less cold.

848
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,700
Break the cycle.

849
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,880
That's too late.

850
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,020
I'm not breaking any cycles today.

851
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,260
I'm not breaking any cycles today.

852
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,160
The cycle continues.

853
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,080
The cycle continues.

854
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,480
Alright.

855
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,280
We got a...

856
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:01,720
Okay.

857
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,280
We definitely gotta get that.

858
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,600
And then we gotta get...

859
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,360
Palace sphere.

860
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,060
Repair bench.

861
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:09,780
This.

862
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,480
We need a bed.

863
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,420
We need this.

864
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,580
Do we need a repair kit?

865
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,280
No, we don't.

866
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:16,800
We need cloth.

867
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,040
We need shield.

868
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,660
Feed box.

869
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,000
Hang.

870
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,140
No, we don't need that.

871
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:25,700
Berries.

872
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,420
We don't need any of those.

873
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,220
I guess we need none of that.

874
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:30,460
Yeah.

875
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,420
Violence.

876
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,460
Bring violence.

877
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,480
Alright.

878
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,820
Check the survival guide.

879
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:36,780
Alright.

880
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:37,800
I did it.

881
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,060
I don't wanna live here.

882
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,400
That's the thing.

883
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,740
I don't wanna live here.

884
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,620
I just wanna get my items.

885
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,920
That's all I want.

886
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,020
I just...

887
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,820
I don't wanna... I just wanna get to the checkpoint.

888
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,940
It's literally right there.

889
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,760
The checkpoint is like...

890
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,440
Like next to the...

891
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,360
My body.

892
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,340
My dead body.

893
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,720
I swear.

894
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,820
I've seen it.

895
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:05,980
Um...

896
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,700
Gino, thank you for the super chat.

897
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,120
Thank you.

898
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:09,600
Thank you.

899
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,740
You're right, Doki.

900
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,980
This is a unique Power World stream.

901
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,620
Well worth watching.

902
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,320
Do I even have enough for a torch?

903
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,380
Oh my god.

904
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,880
Oh, tab.

905
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:22,700
That's why.

906
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,680
I know I'm doing sparkles.

907
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,500
Oooh.

908
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,860
It's cause tab is my sparkle.

909
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:29,740
Hahaha.

910
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,240
Hahaha.

911
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,440
Now I know.

912
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,360
Every time I...

913
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,380
I'm like, it's time to upgrade.

914
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,580
Oh.

915
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,300
Hahaha.

916
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,360
Oh my god.

917
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,800
It's upgrade time.

918
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,300
Hahaha.

919
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,840
Hahaha.

920
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,900
Guys, why is it still so dark in Cod?

921
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,540
Hahaha.

922
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,520
Hahaha.

923
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,240
I don't understand.

924
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:01,760
Why is it so dark in cold, sir?

925
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,520
Hahaha.

926
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,200
I said I wanted shorter night time.

927
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,520
How is night time so long?

928
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,920
Did I fuck up?

929
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,040
Hahaha.

930
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,020
Did I accidentally make night twice?

931
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:21,640
I thought shorter means shorter night time.

932
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,780
Oh my god.

933
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,060
I said it backwards.

934
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:25,800
Okay, guys.

935
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,120
I made a mistake.

936
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:27,220
I'm sorry.

937
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:27,940
Guys.

938
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,000
I...

939
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,340
Okay, guys.

940
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,040
I made a mistake.

941
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:32,860
We gotta fix this.

942
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,640
I didn't realize I actually made it longer.

943
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,680
I thought I had made it shorter.

944
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,740
I was so confused.

945
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,200
Alright.

946
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,420
There we go.

947
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,280
That's better.

948
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,440
Oh, so this is the opposite.

949
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,200
Oh.

950
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,440
Oh.

951
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,000
Okay.

952
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,000
Things make a lot more sense now.

953
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,600
So does this mean...

954
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,560
I think we can be at like 18.

955
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,120
A solid 18 now.

956
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,100
And then that's it.

957
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,460
Alright.

958
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,140
We figured it out.

959
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,520
It's...

960
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:06,900
Yeah.

961
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,300
Sorry.

962
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,520
I'm a little special.

963
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:09,640
Hahaha.

964
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,220
New skin suit.

965
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,260
Same old doki.

966
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,200
So that's when you know like...

967
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,800
Things are...

968
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,620
Things never change.

969
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:18,720
Hahaha.

970
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,360
Alright.

971
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,720
How fast is this then?

972
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,860
Is it gonna be daytime soon, sir?

973
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,200
Do you think the sun's gonna be...

974
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:27,960
gonna come out now?

975
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,200
Because...

976
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:29,700
Wait.

977
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,500
It's getting brighter.

978
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,320
I can see!

979
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:32,580
Wait.

980
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,520
I can see now!

981
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:34,940
Guys.

982
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,140
I can see now!

983
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,680
Does that mean I can make it?

984
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,160
I think I can make it, guys.

985
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,800
I think I can make it.

986
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,000
Okay.

987
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,880
I need to figure out how to get there.

988
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:44,820
Okay.

989
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,120
I need to figure out how to get above.

990
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:46,540
Oh!

991
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,100
I can see now!

992
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,160
I can see!

993
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,280
It is getting brighter!

994
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:50,720
Okay.

995
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,080
Alright.

996
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:51,500
This is it.

997
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,220
Guys.

998
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,100
This is our mission.

999
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,700
Our mission...

1000
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,680
Our mission.

1001
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,640
It's...

1002
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,020
We gotta get my stuff.

1003
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,460
Get a checkpoint.

1004
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,120
Head back to the old... the place we...

1005
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,760
Our new home over there.

1006
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,040
Get to at least level 15.

1007
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,560
And then...

1008
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,960
Maybe I don't get one shot.

1009
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,940
Like... That's our goal.

1010
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:13,820
Hahaha.

1011
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,120
Maybe...

1012
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,240
Maybe by then...

1013
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,160
By then things will be okay.

1014
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,880
Things will be okay.

1015
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,580
Third time's a charm, guys.

1016
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,380
Third time's a charm.

1017
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,320
We can make it.

1018
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:27,860
I believe.

1019
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,080
Days are... nights are shorter now.

1020
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:33,740
Our goal...

1021
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,640
Our goal...

1022
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,660
Kill a frog.

1023
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:36,500
Hahaha.

1024
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,260
Hahaha.

1025
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:40,840
That's...

1026
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,100
That's our goal.

1027
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:42,600
Wait.

1028
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,660
No chat on screen?

1029
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,460
Oh no.

1030
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:44,800
Okay.

1031
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,620
I'll fix that later.

1032
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,140
First off, we need to figure out how to...

1033
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:51,120
Guys, first off, we have to figure out a lot of things first.

1034
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:51,420
Okay.

1035
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,260
One at a time.

1036
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,640
Guys, one...

1037
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,780
We have to do things one at a time.

1038
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:56,740
Hahaha.

1039
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:58,660
Hahaha.

1040
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,800
There's... There's a lot of stuff going on.

1041
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,520
Alright.

1042
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,100
One at... Look, I gotta compensate.

1043
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:06,820
Okay.

1044
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,040
If I...

1045
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,800
Hahaha.

1046
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,460
If I...

1047
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:15,320
If I... If I don't have the front, at least I have the back.

1048
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:15,760
Okay?

1049
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,420
All my assets are...

1050
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,820
All my assets are up in the...

1051
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,300
Hahaha.

1052
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,800
That's where all the assets are.

1053
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:25,560
Hahaha.

1054
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:27,700
Hahaha.

1055
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:29,760
Alright.

1056
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:30,820
Oh, I see it.

1057
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,160
I see the two bright blue lights.

1058
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,480
Um...

1059
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,600
It's right there.

1060
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,400
I see it.

1061
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,060
We're gonna make it.

1062
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,300
Alright.

1063
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,680
Oh, I want the effigy though.

1064
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:42,620
Yay!

1065
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,460
Alright.

1066
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,080
We got the effigy right here.

1067
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,120
And...

1068
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,560
And then we gotta get out of there.

1069
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,820
And then...

1070
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:52,980
Oh my god.

1071
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,840
I haven't played Palworld in so long.

1072
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,120
I remember just...

1073
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,040
I don't remember what level.

1074
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:57,520
I think I...

1075
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,160
I think I stopped at level 30.

1076
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,260
Uh, like just playing it.

1077
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,480
Just playing it like not in a tournament setting.

1078
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,200
Oh my god.

1079
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:07,620
Guys.

1080
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:08,800
I swear guys.

1081
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,980
It'll be so cool.

1082
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,920
The moment we can make it.

1083
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,400
The moment we make it here.

1084
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,160
I swear.

1085
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,140
This place will be so cool.

1086
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,380
When I don't insta-die, you guys are gonna see how cool this place is.

1087
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,140
I swear guys.

1088
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,420
I'm not coping.

1089
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,380
The moment...

1090
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,480
Oh no.

1091
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,200
Oh no.

1092
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:31,820
I'm sorry.

1093
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:32,380
Oh no.

1094
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,080
Don't look at me.

1095
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,220
Don't look at me.

1096
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:34,860
Oh no.

1097
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,480
Oh no.

1098
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:36,840
Oh, okay.

1099
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:37,780
We're fine.

1100
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:38,820
We're fine.

1101
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:39,840
He didn't see me guys.

1102
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,600
He's afraid of the water.

1103
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:43,860
It's okay.

1104
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:44,880
It's okay.

1105
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:48,100
When the power will become a horror game guys.

1106
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:52,800
That's the lonely level five trying to figure out her place in this world.

1107
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:54,300
Alright.

1108
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,000
We're okay.

1109
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,420
We're okay.

1110
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:58,640
Alright.

1111
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,320
We gotta head.

1112
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,060
We gotta head over here.

1113
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,280
That's our stuff.

1114
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:03,720
That's our stuff over there.

1115
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:04,840
That's where I died chat.

1116
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,140
Oh no.

1117
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,320
No, it's streamers.

1118
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,200
Streamers don't hurt you.

1119
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,540
Streamers are the ones that are afraid of you.

1120
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:11,220
So we're fine chat.

1121
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,700
These guys don't hurt you.

1122
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,180
See look.

1123
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:15,020
They're running away.

1124
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,100
Look at that.

1125
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:16,900
They don't know.

1126
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,660
They don't know.

1127
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,220
They're level 46 but they don't know.

1128
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,120
They think I'm just as big of a threat as the others.

1129
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:26,680
Wait.

1130
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:27,360
There's a key?

1131
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,160
When did I get a key?

1132
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,640
When the fuck did I get a key?

1133
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,000
When the fuck did I get a key?

1134
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,120
Alright.

1135
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,600
They're just funny little guys.

1136
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,020
They don't know what to expect.

1137
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,380
They think I'm a threat.

1138
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:46,020
I mean if I saw those thighs I'd run away too.

1139
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,600
Is that a free powball?

1140
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:50,880
Um.

1141
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,720
Mason thank you for the akasupa.

1142
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:55,260
Thank you.

1143
00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:02,780
Dragoons I'm trying to sneak around but I'm dummy thick and the clap from my ass cheeks keeps alerting the frogs.

1144
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,580
What are you?

1145
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:06,760
Oh god it's the frogs.

1146
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:07,800
It's the frogs.

1147
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:08,640
Oh god.

1148
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:11,000
Oh no.

1149
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,680

1150
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:16,580
Oh no.

1151
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,220

Okay.

1153
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,320

1155
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:24,320
Wait.

00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,280
Isn't that different skin?

1157
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,640
That's not the usual one.

1158
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:28,380
Yeah.

1159
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,700
He's green now.

1160
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,420
Cause it used to be like full white.

00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,720

But they can't climb.

1253
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:45,680
They're so stupid.

1254
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:46,920
They can't.

00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,100
They can't get up here.

1270
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:17,520
Haha.

Are these guys friendly?

1303
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,760
I'm gonna assume that nobody's friendly here.

1304
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:15,120
Wait that guy's new?

00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:30,620
The other... the other... the fox girl that looks like that Pokemon fox one?

1313
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:34,820
Now it's... now she's red instead of yellow!

1314
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:35,680
Hello.

1315
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,440
Are you friendly?

1316
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:40,870
Oh wait no it's a man!

1317
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:43,410
Wait that's a beard.

1318
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:44,950
Oh wait nevermind.

1319
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:45,830
Sorry.

1320
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:49,430
Wait no you are female!

1321
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:50,470
No you're female!

1322
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:51,830
You have a beard!

1323
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:53,070
Oh.

1324
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:57,030
Sorry I saw a beard and just assumed.

1325
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:57,770
I'm sorry.

1326
00:49:57,930 --> 00:49:58,870
I'm sorry ma'am.

1327
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:00,010
I'm sorry.

1328
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:01,170
It's a goat!

1329
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:01,590
Yeah.

1330
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:05,970
Wait this is a nice place to live.

1331
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:09,010
I wanna live near the sakura blossoms.

1332
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:13,070
I feel like this should be my new... it's ladybeard.

1333
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:13,430
Yeah.

1334
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:15,350
This could be my new home.

1335
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:19,350
Look all these guys are like super friendly too.

1336
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:20,870
A dancing shrine!

1337
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:23,730
They all seem really nice.

1338
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:25,010
Uh.

1339
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:32,870
I don't feel like they're gonna murder me like the other the other pals that I bumped into.

1340
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:36,550
Look I know I haven't established a home yet guys.

1341
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:38,770
I know but this isn't important.

1342
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:43,870
We've all seen people establish homes like 200 million times.

1343
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:46,190
But this is a new area.

1344
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:49,790
And we're exploring new paths guys.

1345
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:50,630
New friends.

1346
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:52,870
Oh there's so many of the pink guys.

1347
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:54,730
They seem like super common too.

1348
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:55,770
Um.

1349
00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:00,790
Yeah we wanna check out the sakura stuff.

1350
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:02,350
Please leave me alone.

1351
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:03,470
I'm trying to take loot.

1352
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,290
Wait is that that's... is that new?

1353
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:06,310
I don't think that's new.

1354
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:08,510
I don't think the yellow birds are new.

1355
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:09,850
Cause I'm a yellow bird.

1356
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:14,590
I wonder if I can finally head to the tree.

1357
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:16,590
Is that big tree part of the map now?

1358
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:17,930
I wonder.

1359
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:20,710
I actually don't know if uh.

1360
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:22,110
The.

1361
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:22,770
Oh it's not.

1362
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:23,390
Nope.

1363
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:24,090
Yeah no.

1364
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:25,930
That's another DLC I guess.

1365
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:26,630
That's a.

1366
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:29,210
I think.

1367
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:31,010
I'm pretty sure that's a.

1368
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:32,730
Oh there you go purple ciphers!

1369
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:34,170
More purple ciphers!

1370
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:35,710
Okay that guy is.

1371
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:37,010
Freaking out.

1372
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:38,710
Is that it?

1373
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:40,350
Is there more to this world?

1374
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:42,290
Is there more?

1375
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:43,110
I actually.

1376
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:46,790
I know like there's nothing more after the edge of here.

1377
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:49,130
Uh we're not gonna jump guys.

1378
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:49,810
We are.

1379
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:50,590
We're.

1380
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:51,610
Guys.

1381
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:54,330
I have not found another checkpoint yet.

1382
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:57,910
The closest checkpoint to us is 200 miles away.

1383
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:00,050
And all I have are my legs.

1384
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:01,610
Yes.

1385
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:02,770
They are thick legs.

1386
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:04,590
But it doesn't mean I run faster.

1387
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:05,130
Chat.

1388
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:09,010
I run as fast as a person who has upgraded stamina once.

1389
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:14,150
And even then it's not as fast.

1390
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:15,590
Do a flip.

1391
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:16,490
Alright.

1392
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:17,630
No.

1393
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:18,690
Wait sorry.

1394
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:19,110
No.

1395
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:21,230
I heard the dungeons.

1396
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:22,930
There's some new dungeons as well.

1397
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:26,650
But I feel like dungeons don't really change much in general.

1398
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:29,170
I think my only issue with um.

1399
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:34,230
Well I mean to be fair this is also like with Pokemon.

1400
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:44,270
And my only issue with like these types of games is that um it gets repetitive uh really after a while.

1401
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:50,370
It gets repetitive after a while.

1402
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:52,390
After you play for a certain time.

1403
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:54,170
I think when you get to like the.

1404
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:58,510
Unless you have like uh I think even then if you have like a server filled with others.

1405
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:00,570
It can get repetitive for a bit.

1406
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:03,610
But this is also an issue with um.

1407
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:04,750
Pokemon as well.

1408
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:06,750
That's why I stopped playing Pokemon.

1409
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:07,910
Oh my god.

1410
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:08,410
Thank god.

1411
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:08,970
Okay.

1412
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:13,690
I stopped playing Pokemon after uh Paris.

1413
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:16,790
Uh because Oh no.

1414
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:18,530
Uh because.

1415
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:19,250
Oh no.

1416
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:20,030
I fucked up.

1417
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:21,350
Oh no I'm forever.

1418
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:23,390
Oh no I fucked up guys.

1419
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:28,210
Oh no I'm stuck in sparkle mode.

1420
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:29,190
Oh no.

1421
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:30,050
Okay there we go.

1422
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:31,790
Yeah.

1423
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:32,730
The X and Y.

1424
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:33,970
Oh yeah.

1425
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:34,310
Hey look.

1426
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:35,330
Depressed little cat.

1427
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:36,550
You're depressed here too?

1428
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:38,190
Why are you depressed?

1429
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:39,930
Oh because we're at the cemetery.

1430
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:40,710
Okay sorry.

1431
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:43,050
Uh now I know why you're depressed.

1432
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:45,050
I was like why are you depressed here?

1433
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:46,510
There's Sakura blossom.

1434
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:47,430
Wait what did I get?

1435
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:47,870
I got leather.

1436
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:49,490
How can you be depressed?

1437
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:50,570
Oh I'm sorry.

1438
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:51,470
People died here.

1439
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:52,610
That's why.

1440
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,690
Are you guys nice people?

1441
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:55,870
Hi.

1442
00:53:58,230 --> 00:53:58,670
Yeah?

1443
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:03,830
Hahahaha Hahahaha Alright bye.

1444
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:05,810
Alright.

1445
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:09,270
Pokemon peak with I think.

1446
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:12,910
My favorite Pokemon game was Crystal.

1447
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:17,190
Uh Pokemon Crystal was my favorite Pokemon game.

1448
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:19,170
Um I like.

1449
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:21,230
And also the one where um.

1450
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:25,890
The one where you can have Pokemon follow you around and everything.

1451
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:30,230
Uh I think that one was my favorite as well.

1452
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:33,070
When the Pokemon follows you around and stuff.

1453
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:34,390
I don't remember which one it was.

1454
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:39,110
But I think Pokemon I think Crystal peaked for me.

1455
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:40,790
Alright.

1456
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:41,850
Explore.

1457
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:42,510
Oh my god.

1458
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:44,410
Wait this map is a lot bigger than expected.

1459
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:46,290
That's a lot bigger.

1460
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:48,130
Any other issue I have?

1461
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:51,610
Like um Oh wait hey is that.

1462
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:55,030
That's uh Dark Growlithe.

1463
00:54:56,450 --> 00:54:58,090
Dark Growlithe is that you?

1464
00:54:58,510 --> 00:54:59,410
Are you good?

1465
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:00,610
Yakumo.

1466
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:03,930
It is.

1467
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:05,030
It's Dark Growlithe.

1468
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:05,430
Oh.

1469
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,040
Oh.

1470
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:15,040
Oh.

1471
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:18,240
Oh.

1472
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:19,740
No.

1473
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,020
We thought it got a checkpoint.

1474
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:24,060
Oh wait I did.

1475
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:24,320
Okay.

1476
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:24,680
Okay.

1477
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:24,920
I did.

1478
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:25,800
He respawned here.

1479
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:26,920
And then.

1480
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:31,460
I thought he was a good boy.

1481
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:32,780
I thought he was a good boy.

1482
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:33,640
I was eyes of a boy.

1483
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:37,160
I was eyes of a boy.

1484
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:40,500
How was I supposed to know that?

1485
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,580
I thought he was a good boy.

1486
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:48,980
That sounds like.

1487
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:49,320
Oh.

1488
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:50,100
Good boy.

1489
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:51,440
Dark Growlithe.

1490
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,680
When did they stop being good boys?

1491
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:56,260
Chat.

1492
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:00,920
Oh my god.

1493
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,720
I should have expected it when he was.

1494
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:03,940
When he was dark.

1495

Like I like to keep my new skin suit.

1754
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:30,660
It is simpler.

.

1763
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:40,120
.

1764
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:43,880
Other than my hair.

1765
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,140

1766
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:45,720

1767
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:46,640
Um.

1768
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,080
It is easier.

1769
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:48,800
.

1770
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:48,840
.

1771
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,400
It's easy and memorable.

1772
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:54,720
That was like my goal.

1773
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:55,500

01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:01,840
I'm trying to figure out where.

1780
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:02,920
I guess we can live here.

1781
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,960
I mean there's rocks here.

1782
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:06,600
There's trees.

1783
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:07,680
There's rocks.

1784
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:09,480
I think the only issue is that.

1785
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:10,880
The mine.

1786
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:11,580

01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:17,380
The only issue I have.

1792
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:18,820
Unless there's like a better place.

1793
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:19,940
Uh.

1794
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:20,080

Alright.

1811
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:36,120
We only have an issue.

1812
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:37,020
And like.

1813
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,640
I don't know where the.

1814
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:41,700
The ores are so far away.

1815
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:42,620
That's the only issue.

1816
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:43,560
Cause this is normal rock.

1817
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:45,500
This is just regular rock.

1818
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,420
And we're gonna need ores soon.

1819
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:47,980
So.

1820
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:48,920

Oh there is ore mines.

1824
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:53,500
You're right.

1825
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:54,120
Wait.

1826
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,200
I don't have to worry about that.

1827
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:56,300
Wait.

1828
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:57,180
Is there ore mines?

1829
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:57,540
Oh.

1830
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:57,920
Shit.

1831
01:02:58,140 --> 01:02:58,580
Okay.

1832
01:02:58,740 --> 01:02:59,100
Oh.

1833
01:02:59,180 --> 01:02:59,620
Shit!

1834
01:02:59,660 --> 01:02:59,940
Okay.

1835
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:01,800
I was not paying attention.

1836
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:02,440
No.

1837
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:02,620
No.

1838
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:02,800
No.

1839
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:03,420
Okay.

1840
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:04,080
Okay.

1841
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:05,200
I was not paying attention.

1842
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:05,960
I was fucking around.

1843
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:06,580
Alright.

1844
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:08,240
This is a little Iffy.

1845
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:10,880
Okay.

1846
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:11,500
We're gonna.

1847
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:12,840
Um.

1848
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:15,240
Okay.

1849
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:15,680
We're.

1850
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:16,240
We're fine.

1851
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:17,720
Or we can live here!

1852
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:18,520
There's a rock.

1853
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:20,340
There's one ore mine.

1854
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,640
And... oh there's a boar.

1855
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:23,680
There's a boar.

1856
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:25,580
Okay.

1857
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:27,600
Everything wants to kill me.

1858
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:28,480
Okay.

1859
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:29,040
It's fine.

1860
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:29,880
Everything is fine.

1861
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:31,020
Everything might want to kill me.

1862
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:31,820
But everything is okay.

1863
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:32,740
Everything...

1864
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:35,260
Yes.

1865
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:37,940
Everything might want to... okay how about... oh I figured it out.

1866
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:38,520
Alright.

1867
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:39,440
We're gonna be here.

1868
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:40,800
So we have...

1869
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,100
Oh here is nice.

1870
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:44,080
Cause we have the trees and we have that one rock.

1871
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:46,400
That one rock is gonna last us forever.

1872
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,940
Oh shit.

1873
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:49,700
Okay.

1874
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,100
That was a mistake.

1875
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,460
I mean I have so many.

1876
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:56,060
Yay!

1877
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:57,780
I have a chick.

1878
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:58,640

New friend.

1887
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:21,720
I did not mean to catch you.

1888
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,460
But I guess you're here now.

1889
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:25,540
Anyway.

1890
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:28,140

What do you do again?

1895
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:38,280
I forgot what does the chicken do.

1896
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:39,940
You are useless.

1897
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:40,440
Okay.

1898
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:41,040

01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:58,340
I need to craft... I need to build a...

1906
01:04:58,340 --> 01:04:59,280

1907
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,020
Alright.

1908
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:01,000
This is your first job.

1909
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:04,040
You're fine.

1910
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:04,540
Okay.

1911
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:05,200
Let me...

01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,380
And now I have to build a...

1913
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,460
I need to build a POW box.

1914
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:10,300
Oh I don't have enough wood.

1915
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:11,300
Okay.

1916
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:11,960
You'll be fine.

1917
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:13,700
You do your thing.

1918
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:14,720
Look.

1919
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:16,960
I'm looking at your HP to make sure you're okay.

1920
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:18,060
Okay.

1921
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:18,720
I should have...

1922
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,160
I should have enough.

1923
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:20,880
You'll be fine.

1924
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:21,200
See.

1925
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:21,680
Look at you.

1926
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:22,440
You're doing it.

1927
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,560
I don't even have to look.

1928
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,500
I know you're doing it.

1929
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:29,980
Look.

1930
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:31,240
Oh my god.

1931
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:31,540
What?

1932
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:32,380
You killed him?

1933
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:35,960
Oh my... I knew... I knew it Dragoon.

1934
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:37,860
I knew you were never useless.

1935
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:41,640
I knew you were just as good as all of the...

1936
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,500
Don't let those others Dragoon.

1937
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:48,760
Don't let all those other VTuber mascots pick on you Dragoon.

1938
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:50,440
I knew you were never useless.

1939
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:56,440
You...

1940
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:57,160
Wait.

1941
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,080
POW dressing facility?

1942
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:00,460
Wait.

1943
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,640
I can dress you up?

1944
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:06,060
Don't let them.

1945
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:06,680
You might...

1946
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:09,000
Your only job is just to lay eggs.

1947
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:11,260
We know... You know your purpose.

1948
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:12,080
Guys.

1949
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:15,360
You know your purpose Dragoons.

1950
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:18,660
Like you might be only able to lay eggs.

1951
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:22,440
And you're not able to do... mine anything or contribute to the base.

1952
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:23,900
But...

1953
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:25,820
You can lay eggs.

1954
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:27,840
And you beat up a boar.

1955
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:30,520
And that's all that matters to me.

1956
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:31,680
Um...

1957
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:33,940
You guys got this.

1958
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:35,040
Wait.

1959
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:37,040
We don't have like the fragments.

1960
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:38,660
So that's a little bit of an issue.

1961
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:39,540
I need to find...

1962
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:40,580
Uh...

1963
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:45,420
I need to find like a thing to mine the fragments.

1964
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:46,580
Uh...

1965
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:46,920
Wait.

1966
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:47,520
Are you female?

1967
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:50,180
Are you?

1968
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:51,020
No.

1969
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:51,740
Wait.

1970
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:52,540
You lay eggs?

1971
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:53,260
But you're...

1972
01:06:58,360 --> 01:06:59,360
You're special.

1973
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:03,140
You're my special Dragoon.

1974
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:08,980
Alright.

1975
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:10,220
Um...

1976
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:10,840
What do I need?

1977
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:11,980
Crab cloth to...

1978
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:12,220
Oh.

1979
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:12,720
I need cloth.

1980
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:13,300
You're right.

1981
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:14,560
Uh...

1982
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:15,200

1983
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:17,680
Alright.

1984
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:19,080
Yay!

1985
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:20,400
Wait.

1986
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:21,960
There's another Dragoon over there?

1987
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:22,680
Yeah.

1988
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:24,700
But he's not as good as that Dragoon.

1989
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,420
Go over there and beat him up.

1990
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:28,440
No.

1991
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:29,700
You're not supposed to be friends with him.

1992
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:30,600
Hit him!

1993
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,320
Oh my god.

1994
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:33,360
Dragoon!

1995
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:35,020
It's survival of the fittest!

1996
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,080
Now hit him.

1997
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:37,980
That's right.

1998
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:39,100
Hahaha.

1999
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:39,720
Hahaha.

2000
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:41,280
Hahaha.

2001
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:43,500
Alright.

2002
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:44,200
Let's see.

2003
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:45,840
What do the lambs do?

2004
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:46,640
Lambs work, right?

2005
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:47,440

2006
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:48,680

I need you in my army.

2011
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:56,340
There you go.

2012
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:58,120
We're friends.

2013
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:58,520
No.

2014
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:00,400
There's no friends in PAL world.

2015
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:01,040
Haha.

2016
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:02,440
Only PAL.

2017
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:05,680
Only workers.

2018
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:06,800
Hahaha.

2019
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:09,060
Hahaha.

2020
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:09,220
Hahaha.

2021
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:09,580
Hahaha.

2022
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:12,140
No friends.

2023
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,640
Only workers in PAL world.

2024
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:15,900
Alright.

2025
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:16,560
Let's see.

2026
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:17,820
Oh.

2027
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:18,180
Sorry.

2028
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:22,940
The only issue right now is the fact that...

2029
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:23,600
Hahaha.

2030
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:27,160
It's binded to the numbers.

2031
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:27,660
Okay.

2032
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:28,760
Now you can work.

2033
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:30,260
Alright.

2034
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:31,040
What do you do again?

2035
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:32,080
You are...

2036
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:32,580
You're a worker!

2037
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:33,060
Okay.

2038
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:33,440
Go work.

2039
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:36,980
Go be a good pal and work for me.

Uh...

2047
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:46,820
I'm not your pal, buddy.

2048
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:50,020

01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:03,620
PALs will bed.

2061
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:04,180
We'll get stressed.

2062
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:05,280
Well, I guess it's time...

2063
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:06,020

2070
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:15,560
Hahaha.

2071
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:17,020
Hahaha.

2072
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:19,580
Look.

2073
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:20,440
Hahaha.

2074
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,860
You guys willingly worked here.

2075
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:23,640
Hahaha.

2076
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:25,660
Hahaha.

2077
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:27,200
Alright.

2078
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:27,800
Let's see.

2079
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:32,120
I need a crab cloth and equipment and prepare for a chill night.

2080
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:32,460
Okay.

2081
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:33,260
How much is a cloth?

2082
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:34,340
I need two.

2083
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:34,980
Alright.

2084
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:37,120
Get over here.

2085
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:37,580
Get over here.

2086
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:39,440
Get over here.

2087
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:41,440
That's fucking right.

2088
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:42,320
Hahaha.

2089
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:43,900
Finish that.

2090
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:44,700
I'm a supervisor.

2091
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,080
Hahaha.

2092
01:09:50,990 --> 01:09:51,470
Okay.

2093
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:52,130
Let's see.

2094
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:53,950
What do I need?

2095
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:55,310
I need to...

2096
01:09:55,310 --> 01:09:59,250
We need to up these two the most, I feel like.

2097
01:09:59,470 --> 01:10:00,870
And then we'll put a little bit...

2098
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:02,090
Um...

2099
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:04,830
Um...

2100
01:10:06,810 --> 01:10:07,950
Craft the cloth.

2101
01:10:08,210 --> 01:10:08,450
Oh, yeah.

2102
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:09,330
We need the...

2103
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:10,590
We need to be able to craft the cloth.

2104
01:10:10,610 --> 01:10:11,130
Craft the cloth.

2105
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:12,330
Get over here!

2106
01:10:13,190 --> 01:10:14,030
That's right.

2107
01:10:14,330 --> 01:10:14,830
Hahaha.

2108
01:10:16,070 --> 01:10:16,710
Hahaha.

2109
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:18,310
Hahaha.

2110
01:10:18,430 --> 01:10:18,750
Hahaha.

2111
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:18,810
Hahaha.

2112
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:20,290
That's fucking right.

2113
01:10:20,530 --> 01:10:21,870
I supervise.

2114
01:10:21,870 --> 01:10:22,730
You work.

2115
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:23,570
Hahaha.

2116
01:10:23,730 --> 01:10:25,370
And then you pay me.

2117
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:26,230
Hahaha.

2118
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:28,090
Hahaha.

2119
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:28,530
Hahaha.

2120
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:28,970
Hahaha.

2121
01:10:29,010 --> 01:10:29,650
Hahaha.

2122
01:10:29,650 --> 01:10:29,770
Hahaha.

2123
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:31,130
That's fucking right.

2124
01:10:31,450 --> 01:10:31,790
Hahaha.

2125
01:10:32,370 --> 01:10:33,590
Work, Lambel.

2126
01:10:33,870 --> 01:10:34,510
Work.

2127
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:35,050
Hahaha.

2128
01:10:35,150 --> 01:10:38,790
Don't make me grab my dragoon over here for the muscle.

2129
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:39,510
Hahaha.

2130
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:40,550
Alright.

2131
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:41,810
Oh, yeah.

2132
01:10:41,850 --> 01:10:42,530
What do we call you?

2133
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:43,390
Look.

2134
01:10:43,390 --> 01:10:44,230
He's happy working.

2135
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:46,850
You work till you die.

2136
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:47,870
Hahaha.

2137
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:48,910
Yay!

2138
01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:50,490
I have clothes now.

2139
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:51,710
Hahaha.

2140
01:10:52,630 --> 01:10:54,010
Do we get day up?

2141
01:10:54,190 --> 01:10:54,430
Haha.

2142
01:10:54,970 --> 01:10:56,630
You think you have rights?

2143
01:10:56,950 --> 01:10:57,430
Hahaha.

2144
01:10:58,530 --> 01:10:59,010
Uh...

2145
01:10:59,010 --> 01:10:59,330
Let's see.

2146
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:01,270
We need wood, stone, and fiber.

2147
01:11:01,450 --> 01:11:02,550
How do we make fiber again?

2148
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:04,330
I don't remember.

2149
01:11:04,610 --> 01:11:04,830
Oh, wait.

2150
01:11:04,910 --> 01:11:07,150
It's like we gotta chop the trees into...

2151
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:08,230
Uh...

2152
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:09,090
Wait.

2153
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:09,490
What am I doing?

2154
01:11:09,490 --> 01:11:11,070
I can, like, make an axe.

2155
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:12,650
God, it's been so long.

2156
01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:13,210
Okay.

2157
01:11:13,250 --> 01:11:14,250
I need rocks.

2158
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:15,430
Alright.

2159
01:11:17,070 --> 01:11:18,610
The sheep will be...

2160
01:11:18,610 --> 01:11:19,410
Oh, you're right.

2161
01:11:19,490 --> 01:11:20,970
Let me rename you, sheep.

2162
01:11:21,330 --> 01:11:22,610
It's naming time.

2163
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:24,030
It's your naming...

2164
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,950
It's naming time, little guy.

2165
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:29,290
You get to be named.

2166
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:33,110
Chunky.

2167
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:34,870
Goon.

2168
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:36,810
Oh, my God.

2169
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:38,410
You get to be named.

2170
01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:39,410
Chunky.

2171
01:11:39,410 --> 01:11:39,470
Chunky.

2172
01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:40,930
Congratulations!

2173
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:44,210
Isn't that great?

2174
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:47,370
You get to be named!

2175
01:11:51,470 --> 01:11:52,070
Alright.

2176
01:11:53,530 --> 01:11:55,710
Let's see, I need a...

2177
01:11:56,730 --> 01:11:59,850
I need to grab some more rocks.

2178
01:12:00,730 --> 01:12:02,230
Alright, come over here.

2179
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:04,290
Come over here, dragons.

2180
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:05,390
We need rocks now.

2181
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:08,250
Alright, nice.

2182
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:10,670
Grab some berries.

2183
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:15,070
And we gotta beat up some fucking rocks, cause we are...

2184
01:12:15,070 --> 01:12:15,930
Can I beat up rocks?

2185
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:16,890
I'm pretty sure, right?

2186
01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:17,930
We don't need the axe.

2187
01:12:19,130 --> 01:12:20,050
Slow and steady.

2188
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:22,350
Oh yeah, okay.

2189
01:12:22,490 --> 01:12:23,110
It's been a while.

2190
01:12:23,350 --> 01:12:25,250
It's been a while since I played Palworld.

2191
01:12:26,770 --> 01:12:29,630
Welcome Chang'un to the mines.

2192
01:12:32,990 --> 01:12:33,430
Nice.

2193
01:12:35,390 --> 01:12:36,690
You're a lucky dragon.

2194
01:12:37,030 --> 01:12:38,730
You're a very lucky dragon.

2195
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:40,190
Because you were here first.

2196
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:42,290
So you get treated the best.

2197
01:12:45,130 --> 01:12:47,030
You get special treatment.

2198
01:12:47,410 --> 01:12:48,950
But don't tell the others.

2199
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:54,170
They'll just know from the way I treat you versus the others.

2200
01:12:57,190 --> 01:12:58,690
The first goon.

2201
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:02,050
You're like my enforcer.

2202
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:04,710
You're like my enforcer dragon.

2203
01:13:05,390 --> 01:13:10,370
If the other goons are out of line, you're here to enforce them.

2204
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:12,230
Any means necessary.

2205
01:13:13,470 --> 01:13:14,650
Alright, let's see.

2206
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:20,870
If we catch enough lamb bells, or if we catch enough chonky goons, it's okay if one gets sick.

2207
01:13:20,890 --> 01:13:22,210
We'll just replace it with the other.

2208
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:30,850
I'm not a bad person, right?

2209
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:34,930
Alright, let's see.

2210
01:13:34,930 --> 01:13:37,510
We have the rocks now.

2211
01:13:38,010 --> 01:13:43,010
So we need to be able to get this.

2212
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:44,070
Alright, where are you?

2213
01:13:44,330 --> 01:13:45,570
Where are you lamb bell?

2214
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:48,090
That's fucking great.

2215
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:49,450
That.

2216
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:53,730
There we go.

2217
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:54,330
Look!

2218
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:56,130
Chonky goon is happy!

2219
01:13:56,770 --> 01:13:58,150
You can't say!

2220
01:13:58,450 --> 01:13:59,530
You can't say that!

2221
01:13:59,710 --> 01:14:01,470
Because chonky goon is happy working.

2222
01:14:02,570 --> 01:14:04,530
How did you get this?

2223
01:14:04,530 --> 01:14:05,630
He's so happy!

2224
01:14:05,790 --> 01:14:06,390
Look at him!

2225
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:09,550
Every time we make something, he smiles.

2226
01:14:10,410 --> 01:14:11,490
What does that say?

2227
01:14:11,770 --> 01:14:12,250
Chat?

2228
01:14:13,210 --> 01:14:16,010
He's happy whenever he makes stuff for me.

2229
01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:18,390
Look at there.

2230
01:14:18,490 --> 01:14:19,370
Look at my enforcer.

2231
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:21,250
Watching me.

2232
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:22,550
Making sure everything is okay.

2233
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:24,750
Alright, let's grab this.

2234
01:14:25,370 --> 01:14:26,430
Is there anything else?

2235
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:29,410
We need to find paladin fragments.

2236
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:31,690
That's one of the only things we're missing.

2237
01:14:33,530 --> 01:14:34,430
It's just...

2238
01:14:34,530 --> 01:14:38,330
We need to find a place for the fragments and stuff.

2239
01:14:39,610 --> 01:14:40,170
Uhhhh...

2240
01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:41,450
Let's see.

2241
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:42,870
We don't really need...

2242
01:14:43,570 --> 01:14:45,310
Porches, I feel like.

2243
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:46,910
We don't need that.

2244
01:14:47,010 --> 01:14:49,190
We definitely need the stone pit and the logging pit.

2245
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:51,370
Oh, it's the bat.

2246
01:14:53,170 --> 01:14:54,830
Yeah, I want the bat.

2247
01:14:55,330 --> 01:14:56,630
We need the crusher.

2248
01:14:56,970 --> 01:14:58,410
We need hot springs.

2249
01:14:58,710 --> 01:14:59,550
I guess.

2250
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:01,910
We need the forge.

2251
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:03,270
There's a bear trap?

2252
01:15:04,530 --> 01:15:05,630
Oh, okay.

2253
01:15:05,850 --> 01:15:06,950
We need nests.

2254
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:09,350
I think that's fine.

2255
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:10,190
Okay.

2256
01:15:11,930 --> 01:15:12,750
Let's see.

2257
01:15:12,950 --> 01:15:14,790
Can we make those now?

2258
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:17,610
We need fragments, stone, and wood.

2259
01:15:18,490 --> 01:15:19,970
Okay, actually can I upgrade?

2260
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:20,870
Oh yeah.

2261
01:15:21,070 --> 01:15:23,630
The thing is...

2262
01:15:23,630 --> 01:15:25,090
You don't need a bed.

2263
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:28,690
Because Chunky Goon, all I'm saying...

2264
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:30,150
You don't need a bed.

2265
01:15:30,290 --> 01:15:32,430
Do you know why I know you don't need a bed?

2266
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:34,410
Well, the thing is...

2267
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:35,670
Chunky Goon...

2268
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:38,850
I made it so the day will never come.

2269
01:15:39,130 --> 01:15:41,370
So the day will never end.

2270
01:15:41,850 --> 01:15:44,310
So the day will never end.

2271
01:15:46,330 --> 01:15:48,790
The day's never gonna end.

2272
01:15:48,970 --> 01:15:51,710
So you never have to sleep.

2273
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:03,250
So you never have to sleep.

2274
01:16:05,530 --> 01:16:07,630
So you can get stressed...

2275
01:16:07,630 --> 01:16:09,630
If the night never shows up.

2276
01:16:10,050 --> 01:16:13,070
You don't need to get stressed if it's never night.

2277
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:13,410
Night time.

2278
01:16:19,870 --> 01:16:22,470
No night, no break.

2279
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:23,890
No night, no break.

2280
01:16:23,890 --> 01:16:25,090
It's only...

2281
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:27,890
We still have plenty of day.

2282
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:29,410
We still have plenty of day.

2283
01:16:30,610 --> 01:16:33,230
I don't remember how to make fiber though.

2284
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:35,470
I think that's the only issue I have.

2285
01:16:35,730 --> 01:16:36,630
Let's see.

2286
01:16:36,910 --> 01:16:37,910
Oh yeah, I need to put...

2287
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:38,950
Inventory time!

2288
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:42,410
My eyes light up when I get to look at my inventory.

2289
01:16:43,210 --> 01:16:43,890
Woooo!

2290
01:16:45,790 --> 01:16:46,470
Woooo!

2291
01:16:46,670 --> 01:16:47,350
Inventory!

2292
01:16:47,490 --> 01:16:49,210
Wait, I thought I picked up my axe.

2293
01:16:50,850 --> 01:16:52,130
Oh, I didn't.

2294
01:16:52,130 --> 01:16:53,190
Okay, nice.

2295
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:57,810
Can I get transported on night shift?

2296
01:16:58,230 --> 01:17:00,770
Thank you for the super chat, Kevin.

2297
01:17:00,890 --> 01:17:02,310
Thank you, thank you.

2298
01:17:03,530 --> 01:17:06,370
The funny thing is that...

2299
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:08,390
The funny thing is that...

2300
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:08,930
There's no way I can get to the night shift.

2301
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:10,090
There's no night shift.

2302
01:17:10,330 --> 01:17:11,790
It's always day.

2303
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:17,670
Silly goon.

2304
01:17:17,770 --> 01:17:20,370
Thinking that day actually exists.

2305
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:22,150
Silly, silly.

2306
01:17:24,710 --> 01:17:26,750
Alright, let's grab some wood.

2307
01:17:27,010 --> 01:17:28,270
Cause I think we need wood.

2308
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:30,910
We need wood and like...

2309
01:17:30,910 --> 01:17:31,790
What else do we need?

2310
01:17:32,150 --> 01:17:33,230
I don't remember actually.

2311
01:17:33,550 --> 01:17:36,390
I'm gonna grab some fucking ores too.

2312
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:37,010
Real fast.

2313
01:17:38,930 --> 01:17:44,910
Other opportu- The only way to get promoted...

2314
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:47,050
Is to kill the first dragoon.

2315
01:17:50,890 --> 01:17:53,970
If you kill the first dragoon...

2316
01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:54,710
You get...

2317
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:56,350
You get to be...

2318
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:57,770
You get promoted.

2319
01:17:58,010 --> 01:18:00,790
There's only one promotion in this...

2320
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:02,010
In this world.

2321
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:05,870
Alright, I'll just...

2322
01:18:05,870 --> 01:18:08,170
I guess I'll make one bed.

2323
01:18:08,930 --> 01:18:09,250
I'll...

2324
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:11,710
I'll say...

2325
01:18:11,710 --> 01:18:13,670
Work for your bed.

2326
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:16,170
That's fucking right.

2327
01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:19,690
If you want a bed, you gotta work on it yourself.

2328
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:26,330
That's fucking right.

2329
01:18:26,970 --> 01:18:27,570
That's fucking right.

2330
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:27,590
Um...

2331
01:18:28,230 --> 01:18:30,990
One must imagine Chonky goon happy.

2332
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:32,830
Thank you for the super chat, Alan.

2333
01:18:32,970 --> 01:18:33,910
Thank you, thank you.

2334
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:35,070
That's right.

2335
01:18:35,070 --> 01:18:36,750
You won a bed.

2336
01:18:40,870 --> 01:18:45,070
Remember what happened in Pikmin if you try to unionize.

2337
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:49,950
I...

2338
01:18:49,950 --> 01:18:53,070
You guys wanna know what happens if you unionize?

2339
01:18:53,210 --> 01:18:55,290
Don't worry, I'll show you what happens soon.

2340
01:18:55,590 --> 01:18:56,150
I...

2341
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:00,230
Don't worry.

2342
01:19:00,730 --> 01:19:01,830
You'll see.

2343
01:19:02,390 --> 01:19:04,170
You'll see what happens.

2344
01:19:05,670 --> 01:19:06,190
Nooooo!

2345
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:11,650
Alright, let's grab some rocks real fast.

2346
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:13,890
We still need to find, like, the...

2347
01:19:14,510 --> 01:19:15,030
Um...

2348
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:17,010
The fragments.

2349
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:19,810
We still don't have the fragments yet.

2350
01:19:20,090 --> 01:19:20,590
Uh...

2351
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:22,010
Daisy, thank you for the super chat.

2352
01:19:22,050 --> 01:19:22,330
Thank you.

2353
01:19:22,350 --> 01:19:26,190
Kill the goon ahead of you and every goon and you go on one rank.

2354
01:19:26,490 --> 01:19:28,070
Thank you for the super chat.

2355
01:19:28,070 --> 01:19:29,350
Thank you, thank you.

2356
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:33,650
Honestly, thank you for the super chat.

2357
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:34,490
Thank you, thank you.

2358
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:37,830
It's a wonder people voluntarily work with you when you joke like this.

2359
01:19:37,930 --> 01:19:38,790
It is a joke, right?

2360
01:19:38,850 --> 01:19:39,650
Thank you for the super chat.

2361
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:40,570
Thank you, thank you.

2362
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:41,150
Yeah.

2363
01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:47,470
Alright, let's see.

2364
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:49,870
We gotta find the fragments.

2365
01:19:50,550 --> 01:19:55,950
It's harder here because this is normally not where I would put my first base.

2366
01:19:55,950 --> 01:19:58,950
But like, it's the closest to the new world.

2367
01:19:59,330 --> 01:20:01,650
Like, I need to get to the new world.

2368
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:04,810
The new world is right beside me.

2369
01:20:04,870 --> 01:20:06,170
I need to head there.

2370
01:20:07,430 --> 01:20:09,210
Where the fuck is the fragments?

2371
01:20:10,190 --> 01:20:12,210
I don't know where the fragments are.

2372
01:20:12,970 --> 01:20:14,310
Alright, thank you for the super chat.

2373
01:20:14,350 --> 01:20:15,170
Thank you.

2374
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:16,070
Who are you?

2375
01:20:16,190 --> 01:20:17,390
Where is Doki?

2376
01:20:17,530 --> 01:20:17,950
It's me.

2377
01:20:18,850 --> 01:20:20,230
I've always been Doki.

2378
01:20:21,110 --> 01:20:22,030
Where the fuck?

2379
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:22,910
What the fuck?

2380
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:24,990
What the fuck is that?

2381
01:20:25,950 --> 01:20:27,490
Has that always been there?

2382
01:20:27,690 --> 01:20:29,950
Why is there like four fucking eggs?

2383
01:20:30,330 --> 01:20:32,230
What kind of spawn is that?

2384
01:20:32,690 --> 01:20:34,070
What the...

2385
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:37,230
Has it always been like this?

2386
01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:39,350
There's so many... what?

2387
01:20:39,450 --> 01:20:41,250
There's so many fucking eggs.

2388
01:20:42,690 --> 01:20:44,450
There's a family over there.

2389
01:20:44,630 --> 01:20:46,110
The council meeting.

2390
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:49,650
Is that... oh, I didn't know.

2391
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:51,650
I didn't realize wolves came from...

2392
01:20:51,650 --> 01:20:54,750
I didn't realize wolves came from fucking eggs.

2393
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:55,830
Oh my god.

2394
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:57,870
It came from eggs?

2395
01:20:59,210 --> 01:21:01,870
Well, I guess like all pals come from eggs in the end.

2396
01:21:02,950 --> 01:21:03,510
Alright.

2397
01:21:03,670 --> 01:21:05,370
Where are the paladin fragments?

2398
01:21:06,050 --> 01:21:07,170
I swear to god.

2399
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:09,070
I literally... all I need are the fragments.

2400
01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:14,310
But I have not found like... those like mineable fragment shit in this area.

2401
01:21:14,610 --> 01:21:17,010
Like you would assume this is like a spawn area.

2402
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:17,650
So...

2403
01:21:17,650 --> 01:21:18,650
What the fuck?

2404
01:21:18,710 --> 01:21:19,530
They're over here?

2405
01:21:21,170 --> 01:21:22,610
They live here too?

2406
01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:23,650
Oh my god.

2407
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:24,150
I want a frog.

2408
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:25,250
What do you do?

2409
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:27,190
I want a frog.

2410
01:21:28,210 --> 01:21:29,290
That's fucking right.

2411
01:21:29,350 --> 01:21:29,530
Okay.

2412
01:21:29,670 --> 01:21:30,210
Alright.

2413
01:21:30,310 --> 01:21:30,750
Let's see.

2414
01:21:30,910 --> 01:21:31,890
Oh my god.

2415
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:33,150
They're baby frogs.

2416
01:21:33,690 --> 01:21:34,610
They exist.

2417
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:37,350
Holy shit.

2418
01:21:37,390 --> 01:21:38,630
The baby frogs exist.

2419
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:40,190
Alright.

2420
01:21:41,690 --> 01:21:42,430
Let's see.

2421
01:21:42,610 --> 01:21:43,290
Oh, 93?

2422
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:44,030
Alright.

2423
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:44,630
Let's see here.

2424
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:46,450
Oh my god.

2425
01:21:46,930 --> 01:21:48,090
They're real.

2426
01:21:49,730 --> 01:21:52,350
They have a baby version of them?

2427
01:21:52,350 --> 01:21:54,310
They're not level 43.

2428
01:21:56,950 --> 01:21:58,450
Oh my god.

2429
01:21:58,510 --> 01:21:59,690
They're not level 43.

2430
01:22:00,090 --> 01:22:00,790
It's over.

2431
01:22:00,970 --> 01:22:02,030
It's over for them.

2432
01:22:02,810 --> 01:22:03,230
God.

2433
01:22:03,230 --> 01:22:04,490
I don't... Oh there's a fragment.

2434
01:22:04,690 --> 01:22:05,050
Nice.

2435
01:22:05,070 --> 01:22:06,150
We need the fragment too.

2436
01:22:06,650 --> 01:22:09,230
We really need to find more places for the fragment.

2437
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:11,310
It's still day.

2438
01:22:11,490 --> 01:22:14,170
It's never gonna be night time.

2439
01:22:18,370 --> 01:22:19,890
You're using megaballs?

2440
01:22:20,050 --> 01:22:20,590
Exactly.

2441
01:22:20,890 --> 01:22:21,450
And?

2442
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:26,070
Yeah.

2443
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:26,550
And?

2444
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:29,110
You're seeing it as if it's a bad thing.

2445
01:22:29,550 --> 01:22:30,030
Guys.

2446
01:22:30,830 --> 01:22:32,450
I don't remember what my 2 does.

2447
01:22:33,970 --> 01:22:35,510
What does my 2 does anyway?

2448
01:22:35,950 --> 01:22:37,570
I'll never... I'll never know.

2449
01:22:38,890 --> 01:22:39,370
Alright.

2450
01:22:39,690 --> 01:22:40,490
Oh there's more.

2451
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:41,830
We need more fragments.

2452
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:44,790
There you go.

2453
01:22:45,070 --> 01:22:46,810
Do the normal rocks give fragments?

2454
01:22:46,930 --> 01:22:47,830
I thought it was...

2455
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:49,350
Oh wait.

2456
01:22:49,390 --> 01:22:50,270
The cats are good workers.

2457
01:22:52,350 --> 01:22:52,910
Get over here.

2458
01:22:54,290 --> 01:22:54,770
Okay.

2459
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:56,470
Alright Dragoon.

2460
01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:56,690
Look.

2461
01:22:56,750 --> 01:22:58,210
I know you're bloodthirsty right now.

2462
01:23:00,290 --> 01:23:01,090
I know.

2463
01:23:01,370 --> 01:23:02,110
I know.

2464
01:23:02,150 --> 01:23:02,990
I know you're...

2465
01:23:02,990 --> 01:23:05,450
I know you're bloodthirsty right now.

2466
01:23:06,610 --> 01:23:09,930
Do I get fragments from... I thought it was like...

2467
01:23:09,930 --> 01:23:11,430
I thought it was like...

2468
01:23:11,430 --> 01:23:14,710
You need like a special rock for it.

2469
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:15,850
It's been so long.

2470
01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:18,670
I didn't realize these also give fragments.

2471
01:23:19,850 --> 01:23:20,690
They give normal fragments?

2472
01:23:20,770 --> 01:23:20,870
Yeah.

2473
01:23:20,890 --> 01:23:21,990
I thought they would give like...

2474
01:23:22,710 --> 01:23:24,530
I thought they give like normal...

2475
01:23:25,610 --> 01:23:26,330
I thought they give like normal...

2476
01:23:26,330 --> 01:23:26,670
Oh my god.

2477
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:27,370
You can fight them.

2478
01:23:27,430 --> 01:23:27,790
I don't care.

2479
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:33,780
Oh stones dropped them?

2480
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:34,640
Oh shit.

2481
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:35,080
Okay.

2482
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:37,500
What am I doing?

2483
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:39,620
I should have just been doing this this entire time.

2484
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:40,940
I should have just been doing this this entire time.

2485
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:40,940
Alright.

2486
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:41,160
Wait.

2487
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:42,100
Do the frogs do anything?

2488
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:43,540
What is your job?

2489
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:44,360
What do you have?

2490
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:46,160
You...

2491
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:46,820
You...

2492
01:23:46,820 --> 01:23:47,000
You...

2493
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:47,100
You...

2494
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:48,800
You...

2495
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:50,260
You...

2496
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:50,260
You gather.

2497
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:51,480
You water.

2498
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:52,660
You...

2499
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:53,320
And... Oh.

2500
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:54,200
Handiwork transport.

2501
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:54,680
Okay.

2502
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:54,900
And...

2503
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:54,900
Oh.

2504
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:54,900
Handiwork transport.

2505
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:54,900
Okay.

2506
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:55,760
Nice.

2507
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:58,160
Give me the fragment.

2508
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:00,860
Oh I can find them near water?

2509
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:02,360
Guys you can tell it's been a while.

2510
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:11,320
You can tell it's been a while since I played this.

2511
01:24:11,740 --> 01:24:12,280
Alright.

2512
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:12,760
Get away.

2513
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:14,760
Get away frogs.

2514
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:16,260
Alright.

2515
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:17,740
Let's go back home.

2516
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:18,820
And...

2517
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:24,740
We go back home and see if we can find the fragments over on the edge of the...

2518
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:25,620
near the water.

2519
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:27,300
We need to find...

2520
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:27,500
Wait.

2521
01:24:27,740 --> 01:24:28,840
There's a chest here.

2522
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:30,600
There's a purple...

2523
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:31,240
Do I have purple key?

2524
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:33,200
I do.

2525
01:24:33,580 --> 01:24:34,700
I got gold coin.

2526
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:36,300
Alright.

2527
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:37,440
Let's see if there's anything here.

2528
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:38,180
Oh wait.

2529
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:38,560
I can upgrade.

2530
01:24:40,580 --> 01:24:41,020
Stamina.

2531
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:42,200
There you go.

2532
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:42,820
Can I do it?

2533
01:24:42,980 --> 01:24:43,400
No.

2534
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:44,500
Alright.

2535
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:44,840
Nice.

2536
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:47,980
It's night time.

2537
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:50,980
It's night time dragon.

2538
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:51,480
Dragon!

2539
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:54,380
It's nighttime.

2540
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:55,920
You think you can sleep?

2541
01:24:56,180 --> 01:25:00,120
You may be my number one enforcer, but that means you never sleep.

2542
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:07,060
It's only work time.

2543
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:12,680
You're right, there's only one.

2544
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:16,180
Your shift is 24 hours.

2545
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:19,460
Seven days a week.

2546
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:24,700
TASKARU, I love to work!

2547
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:25,340
Yay!

2548
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:27,360
Oh, I went the wrong way.

2549
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:28,680
Home is this way.

2550
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:30,480
Uh, what's this?

2551
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:34,360
Dark skill fruit poison blast?

2552
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:35,700
I've never seen this before.

2553
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:37,360
That's the first time I've seen that.

2554
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:41,780
Uh, oh no, we're Amazon workers!

2555
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:44,400
Alright.

2556
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:48,400
Guys, we're almost home!

2557
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:50,900
We're almost home!

2558
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:52,200
Guys!

2559
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:56,240
How's my good worker?

2560
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:00,260
Is my good worker having a good time?

2561
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:03,300
Alright, let's see.

2562
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:06,540
I haven't seen my family in nine weeks.

2563
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,840
You don't have a family anymore.

2564
01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:12,140
The only family you have is us.

2565
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:16,960
Alright.

2566
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:19,660
Oh nice, you leveled up, my little guy.

2567
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:23,460
Alright.

2568
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:24,060
Alright.

2569
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:25,720
Let's see.

2570
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:29,900
Where's the, where's the, where's the Chonky Goon?

2571
01:26:31,660 --> 01:26:32,500
Where is he?

2572
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:34,660
Where did he go?

2573
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:41,160
Wait, where did he go?

2574
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:46,220
Um, alright, we gotta build.

2575
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:47,000
Wait, actually, no.

2576
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:47,540
What am I doing?

2577
01:26:47,780 --> 01:26:50,520
We have to build the stone pit.

2578
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:50,920
We have to build the stone pit first.

2579
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:53,120
We'll build the stone pit here.

2580
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:55,340
Alright.

2581
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:56,360
Where is he?

2582
01:26:57,100 --> 01:26:57,940
Where are you?

2583
01:26:58,800 --> 01:26:59,500
That's right.

2584
01:26:59,740 --> 01:27:02,880
You thought you could hide, but I know you love to work.

2585
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,520
I know you love to work.

2586
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:06,440
Two minutes?

2587
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:07,380
Yeah.

2588
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:10,100
Alright, let's...

2589
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:12,280
You do that, and then I'm gonna...

2590
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:13,340
I need wood.

2591
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:15,340
Alright, give me a sec.

2592
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:16,640
It's okay.

2593
01:27:16,740 --> 01:27:18,400
Although we can't see anything, it's okay.

2594
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:20,880
I know.

2595
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:21,700
I know.

2596
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:26,300
You thought... I knew you love work, so it's okay.

2597
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:33,000
The moment... You thought you could hide, but the moment I put that shit down, you come back to work like a good dragon.

2598
01:27:38,180 --> 01:27:40,480
You know you can't avoid it.

2599
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:43,440
Okay, I'll do this myself, because it's three seconds.

2600
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:46,020
I guess I'll try a little.

2601
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:49,560
Uh...

2602
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:51,060
No, we have enough...

2603
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:51,580
Wait.

2604
01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:52,980
Oh.

2605
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:53,500
Yep.

2606
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:54,180
Can't stop.

2607
01:27:55,620 --> 01:27:57,040
You think you can stop?

2608
01:27:57,940 --> 01:27:59,580
You still have a long way to go.

2609
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:01,520
Guys.

2610
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:03,220
You think...

2611
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:03,640
Oh!

2612
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:04,820
You think you're go...

2613
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:06,620
You think you can just sleep?

2614
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:08,460
No, no, no.

2615
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:10,300
No, no, no.

2616
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:10,880
Wait.

2617
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:11,440
Yes, you can.

2618
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:12,300
Wait.

2619
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:16,760
Never mind.

2620
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:17,760
I guess you can.

2621
01:28:17,940 --> 01:28:18,380
I guess you can.

2622
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:19,880
I guess you can.

2623
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:21,100
I guess you can.

2624
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:22,200
Never mind.

2625
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:22,780
Okay.

2626
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:25,580
That... That ruins things a little bit.

2627
01:28:29,980 --> 01:28:33,320
What do you mean you can just leave?

2628
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:35,540
This is not what I planned!

2629
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:37,800
I also put...

2630
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,560
The bed here too.

2631
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:41,080
Wait.

2632
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:42,120
I can't build here?

2633
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:42,860
Okay.

2634
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:44,440
Just put it here.

2635
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:46,380
Alright.

2636
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:48,340
Sleep while you sleep.

2637
01:28:48,340 --> 01:28:49,140
I still can't.

2638
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:50,980
Oh, the night is going...

2639
01:28:50,980 --> 01:28:52,740
The night is going by so fast.

2640
01:28:53,220 --> 01:28:55,580
The night is going by so fast.

2641
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,140
In like 10 seconds.

2642
01:28:57,540 --> 01:28:58,180
It's okay.

2643
01:28:58,240 --> 01:28:59,680
You're awake for like...

2644
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:01,360
You're awake for like...

2645
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:01,820
Um...

2646
01:29:01,820 --> 01:29:05,000
For like 18 hours and you sleep 1 hour.

2647
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:05,520
Wait.

2648
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:05,680
Sorry.

2649
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:06,460
23 hours.

2650
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:09,160
You're awake for 23 hours and you get 1 hour of sleep.

2651
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:10,280
Every day.

2652
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:11,880
Is that great, guys?

2653
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:12,620
Okay.

2654
01:29:12,660 --> 01:29:13,100
I should eat.

2655
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:16,360
And I guess you get 2 berries too.

2656
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:18,280
Because I feel a little generous.

2657
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:22,080
Alright.

2658
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,760
It's time to wake up.

2659
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:28,700
It's work time.

2660
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,500
It builds morale.

2661
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:33,320
Exactly.

2662
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:34,980
You understand.

2663
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:37,600
Let's see.

2664
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:39,260
Do I still have...

2665
01:29:39,260 --> 01:29:40,940
I still don't have enough for a shield.

2666
01:29:41,420 --> 01:29:44,380
I'm gonna find like a place to grab fragments.

2667
01:29:44,740 --> 01:29:45,900
It's so difficult.

2668
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:49,040
Let's see.

2669
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:51,400
That's literally all I need.

2670
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:52,940
Just like a place for fragments.

2671
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:54,860
Woo!

2672
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:56,120
Okay.

2673
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:58,380
I hope there's stuff here.

2674
01:29:58,740 --> 01:29:59,300
Right?

2675
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:01,520
There might be stuff here.

2676
01:30:01,740 --> 01:30:02,080
Okay.

2677
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:02,860
That's...

2678
01:30:02,860 --> 01:30:05,700
Well, we need you for berries anyway.

2679
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:06,520
So...

2680
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:08,500
Go.

2681
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:09,500
Go, dragoons.

2682
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:09,760
Go.

2683
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:11,700
Go, dragoons.

2684
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:12,060
Go.

2685
01:30:12,620 --> 01:30:14,000
I believe in you.

2686
01:30:14,060 --> 01:30:14,380
Come on.

2687
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,940
You're literally level 12.

2688
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:18,260
You're that fucking beast.

2689
01:30:18,260 --> 01:30:18,740
You're like a bush.

2690
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:20,500
We beat you up.

2691
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:21,920
That's fucking right.

2692
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Kill the plants.

2693
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:24,420
Endgame.

2694
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:26,380
I love the environment.

2695
01:30:26,620 --> 01:30:27,080
God damn.

2696
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:28,200
All right.

2697
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:28,880
That's fine.

2698
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:30,920
I don't really care.

2699
01:30:30,980 --> 01:30:35,880
I know it's a mega sphere, but I can literally swim to the level...

2700
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:36,320
Wait.

2701
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:36,680
What?

2702
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:38,280
Oh, shit.

2703
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:39,200
I thought you were captured.

2704
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:40,160
All right.

2705
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:44,760
Beat the berries out of her.

2706
01:30:45,180 --> 01:30:45,640
Nice.

2707
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:45,960
Okay.

2708
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:46,140
Okay.

2709
01:30:46,860 --> 01:30:48,300
Yes, I'm level 13 now.

2710
01:30:48,460 --> 01:30:48,680
Yay!

2711
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:51,440
Let's see if I'm with the fragments.

2712
01:30:53,160 --> 01:31:01,280
Yes, I know I'm using the Megasphere, but I can literally go to the Forbidden Lands and pick up 20 of them.

2713
01:31:02,180 --> 01:31:02,980
Like, easy.

2714
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,120
Thank you for the super chat!

2715
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:06,060
Thank you, thank you!

2716
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:07,660
Today is my birthday!

2717
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:10,140
Thank you for giving us a good time every time!

2718
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:12,600
Your voice makes me smile!

2719
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:13,680
I love you, Dokie!

2720
01:31:13,740 --> 01:31:14,240
Thank you!

2721
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:15,280
Thank you for the super chat!

2722
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:16,160
Thank you, thank you!

2723
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:18,160
Happy birthday to you!

2724
01:31:18,460 --> 01:31:20,340
Happy birthday to you!

2725
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,680
Happy birthday dear you!

2726
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:24,920
Happy birthday to you!

2727
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:25,300
Yeah!

2728
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:29,700
Oh wait, there's more Paladin fragments.

2729
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:30,260
That's good.

2730
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:34,700
We actually need that.

2731
01:31:35,580 --> 01:31:36,100
Oh!

2732
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:39,400
The Paladin fragments are so difficult to find!

2733
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:43,680
This is a terrible... Why did you guys make me spawn?

2734
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:44,740
No, I'm joking.

2735
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:49,200
I'm joking, it's not your fault.

2736
01:31:51,740 --> 01:31:53,300
Sorry, it was just instinct.

2737
01:31:54,380 --> 01:31:56,600
Blaming others is just instinct right now.

2738
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:00,160
Because it's never the streamer's fault.

2739
01:32:04,460 --> 01:32:07,000
It's never the streamer's fault, guys.

2740
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:12,040
Okay, but we're a family now.

2741
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:13,800
Chat, we're a family.

2742
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:16,920
And family takes responsibility together.

2743
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:21,340
Oh...

2744
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:22,540
Dope.

2745
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:29,240
Guys... we're a family, right?

2746
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,160
Guys...

2747
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:40,660
Remember, we're a family.

2748
01:32:40,660 --> 01:32:40,900
We're a family.

2749
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:44,220
Alright, we gotta get the pickaxe.

2750
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:45,260
We gotta get that bench.

2751
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:47,780
We gotta... we don't need medicine.

2752
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:51,040
If you're sick, we'll just replace you.

2753
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:56,420
Alright.

2754
01:32:58,740 --> 01:33:00,100
Dragos get night pay for this.

2755
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:04,720
When the night is like 30 seconds, I don't think anybody is getting paid for 30 seconds of work.

2756
01:33:04,940 --> 01:33:05,860
Thank you for the super chat.

2757
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:06,220
Thank you.

2758
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:06,800
Thank you.

2759
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:08,240
Uh...

2760
01:33:08,860 --> 01:33:09,260
Nyx!

2761
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:10,400
Thank you for the super chat.

2762
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:10,720
Thank you.

2763
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:11,020
Thank you.

2764
01:33:11,020 --> 01:33:13,960
Love your new skin so keep being... keep on being you.

2765
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:14,440
Thank you!

2766
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:15,160
Thank you for the super chat.

2767
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:15,460
Thank you.

2768
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:15,940
Thank you.

2769
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:17,340
I appreciate it.

2770
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:18,700
Uh...

2771
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:21,500
What's he doing in the water?

2772
01:33:21,580 --> 01:33:22,260
Is he stupid?

2773
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:27,820
What the fuck is he doing trying to swim?

2774
01:33:30,780 --> 01:33:31,200
Alright.

2775
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:32,820
Everyone, run for the hills.

2776
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:34,940
All I'm saying is...

2777
01:33:34,940 --> 01:33:36,780
Don't make me angry.

2778
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:45,740
Guys, I might... I might force... I'm gonna... I'm gonna loot... swap bases.

2779
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:47,340
This base fucking sucks.

2780
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:49,020
I'm gonna go to my usual base.

2781
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:51,780
There's barely any fragments here.

2782
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,920
This is like the worst area to start.

2783
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:57,300
I know... Whenever I get higher level, I move back.

2784
01:33:57,420 --> 01:33:58,420
Like, fuck this area.

2785
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:03,900
Drop one!

2786
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:04,520
No!

2787
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:05,280
What do you mean?

2788
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:06,160
I'm sorry!

2789
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:07,020
I didn't notice!

2790
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:09,280
I'm just stupid!

2791
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:10,000
Alright, guys.

2792
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:10,940
We're moving!

2793
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:12,060
Guys!

2794
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:13,120
We're moving!

2795
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:14,720
It's time to move!

2796
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:17,200
Okay, how do I...

2797
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:20,320
How do I... How do I fucking destroy this?

2798
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:21,340
I don't remember.

2799
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:23,520
Guys, how do you destroy stuff again?

2800
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:25,000
I don't remember.

2801
01:34:30,260 --> 01:34:30,820
Uh...

2802
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:35,200
Oh, it's a C?

2803
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:36,040
It's...

2804
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:37,780
Okay, it's B.

2805
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:38,920
Okay, how do I destroy this?

2806
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:40,100
How do I destroy stuff again?

2807
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:42,460
I'm trying to remember how...

2808
01:34:42,460 --> 01:34:43,780
Oh, do I just hit it?

2809
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:46,840
B and C...

2810
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:47,000
Oh!

2811
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:48,380
Okay.

2812
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:51,920
Oh, I had to assemble.

2813
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:52,240
Okay.

2814
01:34:52,420 --> 01:34:53,060
Yes.

2815
01:34:53,580 --> 01:34:54,220
Yes.

2816
01:34:56,380 --> 01:34:57,020
Uh...

2817
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,040
No beds for you guys.

2818
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:01,640
No.

2819
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:02,480
Oh!

2820
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:04,000
Oh!

2821
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:06,520
Oh, this is bad.

2822
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:07,520
Uh...

2823
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,720
This is very bad.

2824
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:10,320
Uh...

2825
01:35:11,380 --> 01:35:12,060
Nope.

2826
01:35:12,460 --> 01:35:13,760
This is very bad.

2827
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:14,120
Okay.

2828
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:17,460
I'm gonna... You're gonna eat your own child first.

2829
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:23,960
And then we're gonna fucking throw this away really fast.

2830
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:25,420
And then...

2831
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:28,080
We're going to...

2832
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:30,380
You're gonna stay in my pocket.

2833
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:31,840
And...

2834
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:34,220
We're gonna destroy you too!

2835
01:35:35,540 --> 01:35:36,220
Goodbye.

2836
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:38,960
We don't live here anymore.

2837
01:35:40,540 --> 01:35:42,040
We'll come back for you.

2838
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:43,620
Now we don't need any of these.

2839
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:44,080
Alright.

2840
01:35:44,260 --> 01:35:45,000
Come on, guys.

2841
01:35:45,780 --> 01:35:48,440
We're going... We're going back to where...

2842
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:51,340
Where the default spawn is.

2843
01:35:51,740 --> 01:35:54,100
We'll come back to the new world soon.

2844
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:55,980
I swear to God.

2845
01:35:57,960 --> 01:35:59,700
I swear to God.

2846
01:36:00,460 --> 01:36:02,600
All I wanna do is...

2847
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:03,100
You know what?

2848
01:36:03,140 --> 01:36:05,320
I'll just have Dragoon be like super fucking strong.

2849
01:36:05,380 --> 01:36:06,220
And then we're gonna swim there.

2850
01:36:09,380 --> 01:36:10,960
We're returning home!

2851
01:36:11,780 --> 01:36:14,180
Back to where we all started!

2852
01:36:17,950 --> 01:36:18,300
Alright.

2853
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:19,600
It's okay.

2854
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:21,600
It's okay, Dragoon!

2855
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:23,720
We're almost there!

2856
01:36:26,950 --> 01:36:28,020
We're almost there!

2857
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:28,840
Alright.

2858
01:36:29,060 --> 01:36:31,220
I'm fucking... I'm going back here.

2859
01:36:31,380 --> 01:36:32,860
Oh my God, no!

2860
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:35,380
Wait.

2861
01:36:36,220 --> 01:36:37,060
What the...

2862
01:36:44,590 --> 01:36:46,210
Oh no, I forgot!

2863
01:36:48,130 --> 01:36:49,570
I forgot!

2864
01:36:50,190 --> 01:36:50,590
Okay.

2865
01:36:50,690 --> 01:36:51,630
I have a plan.

2866
01:36:52,410 --> 01:36:54,490
I have a plan, guys.

2867
01:36:55,070 --> 01:36:56,970
I have a plan!

2868
01:36:57,470 --> 01:36:58,190
Okay.

2869
01:36:58,430 --> 01:36:58,790
Guys.

2870
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:00,430
We're gonna get a little...

2871
01:37:00,430 --> 01:37:02,250
We're gonna get a little quirky here.

2872
01:37:02,670 --> 01:37:05,970
We're gonna get a little quirky here.

2873
01:37:06,210 --> 01:37:06,930
Okay.

2874
01:37:07,590 --> 01:37:10,550
I didn't think this through.

2875
01:37:10,690 --> 01:37:11,250
Okay.

2876
01:37:11,250 --> 01:37:12,310
I didn't think this through.

2877
01:37:12,430 --> 01:37:14,550
Okay, we're gonna get a little quirkier, guys.

2878
01:37:17,310 --> 01:37:21,710
Alright, let's put these guys away first.

2879
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:26,870
And then, and then we'll put away the important stuff.

2880
01:37:27,190 --> 01:37:29,790
And then, plan B!

2881
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:38,660
We have figured this out!

2882
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:41,600
Exactly!

2883
01:37:43,420 --> 01:37:43,980
Exactly!

2884
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:46,440
Back to where it all started!

2885
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:49,860
Alright!

2886
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:51,080
Nice!

2887
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:52,080
Alright, guys.

2888
01:37:52,540 --> 01:37:53,960
It's like nothing...

2889
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:54,640
Look, see?

2890
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:55,460
It's that easy.

2891
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,680
There we go.

2892
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:00,980
Okay.

2893
01:38:03,660 --> 01:38:05,320
Alright, and I get free stuff!

2894
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:05,980
Look, see?

2895
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:07,240
I got free stuff, guys!

2896
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:09,700
Alright, and then back here!

2897
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:12,880
EW!

2898
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:13,580
Easy!

2899
01:38:14,620 --> 01:38:16,200
And there it is!

2900
01:38:16,660 --> 01:38:18,220
I told you, guys!

2901
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:20,140
Not that difficult.

2902
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:25,100
I'll take all of that away and I'll just leave this chest here because I'm lazy right now.

2903
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:26,320
Um...

2904
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:28,940
Nothing bad happened!

2905
01:38:30,580 --> 01:38:31,500
Yeah, see?

2906
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:34,320
I'm just taking advantage of the mechanics, chat.

2907
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:36,940
I'm just taking advantage of them.

2908
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:39,420
And then, we live here.

2909
01:38:39,860 --> 01:38:40,800
This is like...

2910
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:41,060
See?

2911
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:41,980
This is what I mean!

2912
01:38:41,980 --> 01:38:43,840
This is literally all the good shit!

2913
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:45,820
Look at all these fragments!

2914
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:48,940
I was like, where the fuck are the fragments?

2915
01:38:49,460 --> 01:38:51,440
This is like the best place to ever...

2916
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:53,600
Why would you spawn anywhere else?

2917
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:54,500
Well, not here.

2918
01:38:54,740 --> 01:38:56,260
But like, um...

2919
01:38:56,260 --> 01:38:57,120
Down here.

2920
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:58,960
I usually place my base right there.

2921
01:38:59,220 --> 01:39:01,140
Because it literally has everything I need.

2922
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:05,480
It has the ores, the fragments, the...

2923
01:39:07,020 --> 01:39:09,980
The sheep I'm gonna beat up and let my anger out.

2924
01:39:10,460 --> 01:39:10,980
Um...

2925
01:39:10,980 --> 01:39:11,960
And see, everything is there.

2926
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:13,360
Everything we ever need!

2927
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:15,100
Is right here!

2928
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:18,120
It's like THE spot to build.

2929
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:20,960
Um... I'll build it here.

2930
01:39:21,220 --> 01:39:21,500
Alright.

2931
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:22,700
Alright.

2932
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:24,940
Here we go.

2933
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:28,440
No matter, even if there's a new update.

2934
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:31,280
This is always like THE place to be.

2935
01:39:31,580 --> 01:39:33,600
Alright, frog, sheep.

2936
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:35,380
Alright guys.

2937
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:37,600
And then...

2938
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:38,340
Oh my god!

2939
01:39:38,380 --> 01:39:39,980
I can dress you guys up now!

2940
01:39:40,780 --> 01:39:41,460
Wait.

2941
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:42,660
What is this?

2942
01:39:42,820 --> 01:39:43,660
Alright, work.

2943
01:39:44,340 --> 01:39:45,240
WORK!

2944
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:47,000
Yes, work!

2945
01:39:50,700 --> 01:39:51,600
Yes!

2946
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:57,100
Good!

2947
01:39:57,600 --> 01:39:59,080
My good workers!

2948
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:00,780
That's right!

2949
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:04,480
Only one hour has passed.

2950
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:05,480
Since...

2951
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:08,220
Only one day hour has passed.

2952
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:09,940
Change the skin?

2953
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:11,520
Oh!

2954
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:15,460
That's what it does?

2955
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:18,120
Oh my god!

2956
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:18,780
Where's the cat?

2957
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:20,200
Get over here.

2958
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:23,600
Get over here.

2959
01:40:26,140 --> 01:40:28,020
I need you to have glasses.

2960
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:33,320
Alright.

2961
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:35,460
Oh my god!

2962
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:36,260
Yeah!

2963
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:38,560
You're cool now!

2964
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:40,480
You're so cool!

2965
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:41,480
Alright.

2966
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:41,940
Alright.

2967
01:40:41,940 --> 01:40:44,100
You're not cool enough.

2968
01:40:45,020 --> 01:40:45,580
Oh my god!

2969
01:40:45,580 --> 01:40:46,020
What does he do?

2970
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:47,800
He mines!

2971
01:40:48,140 --> 01:40:48,900
Look at him!

2972
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:51,020
He's cool now!

2973
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:56,700
Look at him!

2974
01:40:56,700 --> 01:40:57,640
He's so cool!

2975
01:40:59,460 --> 01:40:59,980
Alright.

2976
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:01,360
What do I need to upgrade?

2977
01:41:01,580 --> 01:41:04,660
I need a primitive workbench and a shoddy bed.

2978
01:41:04,980 --> 01:41:05,240
Okay.

2979
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:05,640
That works.

2980
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:08,140
So now I can have Chonky Goon back in there.

2981
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:08,780
Wait.

2982
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:09,500
Who should he be?

2983
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:10,780
The cooler goon?

2984
01:41:10,780 --> 01:41:11,480
Oh you're right.

2985
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:11,920
Okay.

2986
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:13,540
Uh...

2987
01:41:14,940 --> 01:41:16,280
The cooler goon.

2988
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:21,620
Can't see my tears behind those shades.

2989
01:41:22,060 --> 01:41:23,440
Thank you for the super chat, Cass.

2990
01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:23,860
Thank you.

2991
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:24,480
Thank you.

2992
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:25,220
Ani!

2993
01:41:25,220 --> 01:41:25,920
Thank you for the super chat.

2994
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:26,200
Thank you.

2995
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:26,660
Thank you.

2996
01:41:26,660 --> 01:41:27,180
Fun trick.

2997
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:31,820
You can detonate your base console remotely and retrieve the resource to rebuild it from anywhere.

2998
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:33,700
Good for moving lots of stuff easier.

2999
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:34,620
My gosh!

3000
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:36,460
Why didn't I know this before?

3001
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:37,760
Alright.

3002
01:41:37,860 --> 01:41:38,400
Let's see.

3003
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:39,860
Uh...

3004
01:41:39,860 --> 01:41:43,940
Skins obtained inside and outside of the game can be applied here.

3005
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:46,840
So I guess you might be able to unlock stuff?

3006
01:41:47,060 --> 01:41:47,640
To have...

3007
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:49,680
To like...

3008
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:51,060
I guess like to...

3009
01:41:51,060 --> 01:41:52,020
Uh...

3010
01:41:52,020 --> 01:41:53,880
To like dress up your paths?

3011
01:41:55,940 --> 01:41:56,620
That's right.

3012
01:41:57,620 --> 01:41:58,300
That's good.

3013
01:41:58,360 --> 01:42:02,620
You wear the glasses so they don't know how much you're not getting paid.

3014
01:42:04,500 --> 01:42:05,060
That's right.

3015
01:42:05,060 --> 01:42:05,060
You wear the glasses so they don't know how much you're not getting paid.

3016
01:42:05,060 --> 01:42:05,380
That's right.

3017
01:42:05,380 --> 01:42:05,940
You wear the glasses so they don't know how much you're not getting paid.

3018
01:42:05,940 --> 01:42:09,140
If they can't see the tears, Are you actually crying?

3019
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:11,440
Are you actually crying?

3020
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:14,760
If you think about it.

3021
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:18,280
Okay, we need the workbench.

3022
01:42:21,100 --> 01:42:22,700
All I'm seeing is...

3023
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:26,660
Pal- Pal- Pal-San decreased while doing more, causing them to slack off.

3024
01:42:26,820 --> 01:42:27,700
Who's slacking off?

3025
01:42:28,340 --> 01:42:29,340
Who is it?

3026
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:33,640
Who's slacking off right now?

3027
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:35,940
Who's slacking off right now?

3028
01:42:35,940 --> 01:42:36,100
Who is at home?

3029
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:38,080
Uhhh.

3030
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:39,680
Let's see...

3031
01:42:42,660 --> 01:42:43,380
Alright...

3032
01:42:43,940 --> 01:42:45,420
And then...

3033
01:42:45,940 --> 01:42:47,580
How do I make a roof?

3034
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:49,640
There we go.

3035
01:42:52,220 --> 01:42:52,940
Uhhh...

3036
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:54,280
There.

3037
01:42:55,740 --> 01:42:56,760
That's all we need.

3038
01:42:56,900 --> 01:42:58,200
Now build my bed!

3039
01:43:00,700 --> 01:43:02,100
Now build my bed!

3040
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:05,920
Now build my bed!

3041
01:43:05,940 --> 01:43:06,760
Build my bed!

3042
01:43:07,820 --> 01:43:08,840
What's your name?

3043
01:43:09,020 --> 01:43:10,140
You need a new name.

3044
01:43:10,380 --> 01:43:14,780
When you work for Doki Production Incorporated, you get a new name.

3045
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:18,860
Be gone with your old name!

3046
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,180
Frog-Goon.

3047
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:30,560
You get a new name when you work for Doki Bird.

3048
01:43:35,720 --> 01:43:37,380
Eliminate your past self!

3049
01:43:37,780 --> 01:43:38,940
This is new you.

3050
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:39,320
You're right.

3051
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:40,200
It should be one word.

3052
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:41,260
You're right, guys.

3053
01:43:41,540 --> 01:43:42,380
Frog-Goon.

3054
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:43,520
There we go.

3055
01:43:45,060 --> 01:43:45,680
There we go.

3056
01:43:45,740 --> 01:43:45,940
Nice!

3057
01:43:46,140 --> 01:43:46,900
He built my bed.

3058
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:50,900
Yeah, and if anyone's slacking off, you gotta pay me.

3059
01:43:51,820 --> 01:43:52,500
Oh, okay.

3060
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:53,680
Oh, okay.

3061
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:54,840
I don't even need a door.

3062
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:55,920
That's great.

3063
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:03,060
I don't even need a door.

3064
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:05,080
I just...

3065
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:10,160
Let's see.

3066
01:44:10,180 --> 01:44:12,780
Can I upgrade my base so I can put Chonky-Goon back in here?

3067
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:15,160
Chonky-Goon is back to work time.

3068
01:44:15,740 --> 01:44:18,120
It's work time again, Chonky-Goon.

3069
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:20,700
Hey, um...

3070
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:24,400
What do I need to upgrade this?

3071
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:26,540
I think we're making good progress.

3072
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:27,260
Feed box?

3073
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:28,100
You guys need food?

3074
01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:32,640
Wait.

3075
01:44:32,820 --> 01:44:33,060
Wait.

3076
01:44:34,120 --> 01:44:37,160
Are you trying to tell me you need food?

3077
01:44:39,820 --> 01:44:41,360
You need to be fed?

3078
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:43,260
What the fuck is that?

3079
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,680
Oh, I need wood, too.

3080
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:50,100
The pals of a corner.

3081
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:51,900
That's hilarious.

3082
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:55,720
Please don't make me laugh so much.

3083
01:44:57,720 --> 01:44:59,100
Alright, let's see.

3084
01:44:59,900 --> 01:45:02,020
I need to be able to... wait.

3085
01:45:02,020 --> 01:45:03,280
Can I create it?

3086
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:04,840
Where's my workbench?

3087
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:07,480
Where is my workbench?

3088
01:45:10,340 --> 01:45:11,760
Oh, I see.

3089
01:45:15,830 --> 01:45:17,950
Good thing I have my pickaxe.

3090
01:45:23,650 --> 01:45:26,790
Alright, let's see.

3091
01:45:26,850 --> 01:45:29,090
Let's grab these ores real fast.

3092
01:45:29,890 --> 01:45:30,530
Alright.

3093
01:45:31,130 --> 01:45:33,170
I gotta create some stuff.

3094
01:45:33,170 --> 01:45:35,410
I need to create some certain things real quick, guys.

3095
01:45:36,930 --> 01:45:38,450
Stone and flame organs.

3096
01:45:38,790 --> 01:45:43,450
Okay, I clearly don't have enough stone and I need to kill some foxes, too.

3097
01:45:43,690 --> 01:45:44,330
Alright, guys.

3098
01:45:44,430 --> 01:45:45,210
Give me a sec.

3099
01:45:46,570 --> 01:45:48,870
Doki needs to head off for some bus...

3100
01:45:49,390 --> 01:45:52,930
Doki needs to head off on a business trip real fast, guys.

3101
01:45:53,010 --> 01:45:53,990
Give me a bit.

3102
01:45:57,550 --> 01:45:58,330
Doki, please.

3103
01:45:58,890 --> 01:46:00,190
Guys, give me a sec.

3104
01:46:01,090 --> 01:46:03,330
Doki needs to go on a business trip.

3105
01:46:05,890 --> 01:46:07,830
With a little bit of murder.

3106
01:46:11,810 --> 01:46:13,310
Johnny, thank you for the super chat.

3107
01:46:13,430 --> 01:46:13,650
Thank you.

3108
01:46:14,010 --> 01:46:19,830
We already get negative pay, but you slack off, you'll get more negatives faster.

3109
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:21,190
Especially...

3110
01:46:21,190 --> 01:46:21,730
What is it?

3111
01:46:21,730 --> 01:46:22,390
Especially hugs?

3112
01:46:22,770 --> 01:46:24,590
Unless you're into that sort of thing, I guess.

3113
01:46:24,670 --> 01:46:25,290
Yeah, I know.

3114
01:46:25,670 --> 01:46:26,330
Hugs, right?

3115
01:46:27,070 --> 01:46:28,430
There's no censorship here.

3116
01:46:28,430 --> 01:46:30,790
Thank you for the super chat, Johnny.

3117
01:46:30,930 --> 01:46:31,810
Thank you, thank you.

3118
01:46:32,030 --> 01:46:33,570
Where are the flame guys?

3119
01:46:34,910 --> 01:46:35,990
Where are they?

3120
01:46:37,190 --> 01:46:38,230
Where are the...

3121
01:46:38,230 --> 01:46:38,850
Where are the...

3122
01:46:38,850 --> 01:46:40,490
Where are the fire tails?

3123
01:46:40,670 --> 01:46:41,670
I know you exist.

3124
01:46:42,010 --> 01:46:43,470
I've seen you guys around.

3125
01:46:46,850 --> 01:46:48,430
No need to hide.

3126
01:46:48,610 --> 01:46:50,450
I've seen you roaming around.

3127
01:46:51,090 --> 01:46:52,750
I wanna give a hug.

3128
01:46:53,050 --> 01:46:54,450
Where are you lot?

3129
01:46:55,270 --> 01:46:57,710
I've seen you guys travel around here.

3130
01:47:00,810 --> 01:47:01,870
Alright, let's see.

3131
01:47:03,030 --> 01:47:07,810
We might have to go back to the original home to see if we can find the flame boys.

3132
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:14,200
Don't worry.

3133
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:16,320
Flame boy.

3134
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:18,320
Where are you?

3135
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:21,080
Where are you flame boy?

3136
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:25,460
Now I just think you the super chat.

3137
01:47:25,540 --> 01:47:25,780
Thank you.

3138
01:47:26,300 --> 01:47:28,580
Your new skin suit really suits you, Doki.

3139
01:47:28,660 --> 01:47:29,240
Thank you.

3140
01:47:29,300 --> 01:47:30,240
Thank you for the super chat.

3141
01:47:30,340 --> 01:47:31,160
Thank you, thank you.

3142
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:31,800
I know.

3143
01:47:32,100 --> 01:47:33,300
It shows how kind I am.

3144
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:34,100
It really does.

3145
01:47:35,140 --> 01:47:35,740
Uhh...

3146
01:47:35,740 --> 01:47:37,080
Where are the flame boys?

3147
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:39,840
I've seen your tails flying around before.

3148
01:47:40,660 --> 01:47:42,680
I know you're alive...

3149
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:43,440
for now.

3150
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:49,560
Heeeeyyyy...

3151
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:51,980
Flame boys...

3152
01:47:51,980 --> 01:47:52,960
Where are you?

3153
01:47:54,700 --> 01:47:56,960
Why do I have an axe to say?

3154
01:47:57,280 --> 01:47:59,140
I just wanted to ask you something.

3155
01:47:59,560 --> 01:47:59,940
You know?

3156
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:01,900
It's just a little joke.

3157
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:03,620
You know what?

3158
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:05,260
I want this guy.

3159
01:48:05,660 --> 01:48:07,080
You work for me now.

3160
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:10,320
I'm gonna duck your fam- I'm gonna duck you like a kid.

3161
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,400
Alright.

3162
01:48:12,780 --> 01:48:13,300
Alright.

3163
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:15,880
You will never see your family again.

3164
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:19,200
You're level 2 so you're almost a child.

3165
01:48:20,020 --> 01:48:20,540
Yay!

3166
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:22,460
You're gonna work on my company!

3167
01:48:24,100 --> 01:48:26,100
You're gonna work in my company now!

3168
01:48:26,420 --> 01:48:26,840
Yay!

3169
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:32,840
Just wanna ask you a little question.

3170
01:48:33,820 --> 01:48:35,320
I adopted him.

3171
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:37,200
He had no family, guys.

3172
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:40,240
That poor little monkey...

3173
01:48:40,240 --> 01:48:41,940
had no family.

3174
01:48:43,340 --> 01:48:44,420
Oh my god.

3175
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:45,320
It was so sad.

3176
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:48,660
He had no family and I adopted him.

3177
01:48:48,980 --> 01:48:49,620
Oh my god.

3178
01:48:49,660 --> 01:48:51,880
Now he's gonna be okay now.

3179
01:48:52,180 --> 01:48:52,740
Chat.

3180
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:55,080
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

3181
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:58,060
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

3182
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:00,800
Oh there you are.

3183
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:02,300
There you are!

3184
01:49:03,780 --> 01:49:05,000
Oh you're gonna run.

3185
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:06,400
You know what's gonna happen to you.

3186
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:07,240
You're gonna run.

3187
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:10,160
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

3188
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:11,740
Ooh.

3189
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:13,560
You think you can run away?

3190
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:14,580
That's really cute.

3191
01:49:14,900 --> 01:49:16,400
You think you can run away?

3192
01:49:16,860 --> 01:49:18,120
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

3193
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:21,860
Oh he does think he can run away.

3194
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:23,280
Oh I'm so cute.

3195
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:24,820
Oh get over here.

3196
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:26,320
I don't even need to catch you.

3197
01:49:26,380 --> 01:49:27,480
I just need your fucking organ.

3198
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:30,880
It's organ transplant time.

3199
01:49:31,140 --> 01:49:33,160
I'm here to take your kidneys.

3200
01:49:34,020 --> 01:49:34,740
Yay!

3201
01:49:35,340 --> 01:49:36,380
Alright nice.

3202
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:38,420
We did it.

3203
01:49:38,980 --> 01:49:41,600
Run for your life.

3204
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:42,520
Nice!

3205
01:49:43,060 --> 01:49:44,260
I got...

3206
01:49:44,980 --> 01:49:45,480
Oh nice.

3207
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:46,340
Okay I need one more.

3208
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:47,440
Alright.

3209
01:49:48,020 --> 01:49:48,740
No!

3210
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:49,600
Ha ha ha ha.

3211
01:49:52,700 --> 01:49:54,080
Alright let's see.

3212
01:49:54,740 --> 01:49:56,280
Oh there's more of that frog guys.

3213
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:58,860
Alright I don't care about these guys though.

3214
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:00,220
They do not...

3215
01:50:00,220 --> 01:50:01,720
We're gonna make sure they're extinct.

3216
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:02,400
They get endangered.

3217
01:50:03,100 --> 01:50:04,220
Ha ha ha ha.

3218
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:06,220
Not organ trafficking.

3219
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:07,400
Ha ha ha ha.

3220
01:50:08,860 --> 01:50:10,120
What are you guys talking about?

3221
01:50:10,540 --> 01:50:12,040
What the fuck is wrong with them?

3222
01:50:12,060 --> 01:50:12,560
Are they sleeping?

3223
01:50:14,140 --> 01:50:15,140
What's going on?

3224
01:50:15,540 --> 01:50:16,440
Are they okay?

3225
01:50:16,540 --> 01:50:17,580
Did I kill them?

3226
01:50:18,020 --> 01:50:19,360
When did I kill these guys?

3227
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:20,640
Who killed them?

3228
01:50:21,420 --> 01:50:23,260
Wait I didn't kill them.

3229
01:50:23,340 --> 01:50:24,040
Then who did?

3230
01:50:25,180 --> 01:50:26,180
Ha ha ha ha.

3231
01:50:26,680 --> 01:50:28,280
I didn't kill them at all.

3232
01:50:28,460 --> 01:50:30,200
Oh it's the syndicate.

3233
01:50:30,780 --> 01:50:31,700
How dare they?

3234
01:50:31,780 --> 01:50:32,680
They're taking my job!

3235
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:35,280
Ha ha ha ha.

3236
01:50:35,480 --> 01:50:36,480
Oh there's more.

3237
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:37,260
There they are.

3238
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:39,660
Alright Dragoon you can take care of the syndicate.

3239
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:42,900
I need to harvest some organs real fast.

3240
01:50:43,240 --> 01:50:43,700
Alright.

3241
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:45,620
Alright get over here.

3242
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:46,020
You know what?

3243
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:47,000
I need one of you guys.

3244
01:50:47,220 --> 01:50:48,600
I don't need two though.

3245
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:50,300
Ha ha ha ha.

3246
01:50:51,180 --> 01:50:52,900
I just need one.

3247
01:50:53,220 --> 01:50:54,300
Ha ha ha ha.

3248
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:56,100
That's cute.

3249
01:50:56,100 --> 01:50:56,540
You're fucking right.

3250
01:50:57,920 --> 01:50:59,400
That's Doki's job.

3251
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:00,840
That's fucking right.

3252
01:51:00,860 --> 01:51:01,420
Get over here.

3253
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:02,880
There you go.

3254
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:05,720
I just need one of you.

3255
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:06,900
Alright nice.

3256
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:08,840
Alright.

3257
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,180
I'm just gonna watch this.

3258
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:11,440
You guys won't die Dragoon.

3259
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:12,460
You're literally level 15.

3260
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:14,060
How are you gonna die?

3261
01:51:14,580 --> 01:51:15,780
There we go.

3262
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:17,360
Good job.

3263
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:19,200
Now I'm gonna fucking loot them.

3264
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:20,200
Yay!

3265
01:51:20,380 --> 01:51:21,440
Look they have a bounty.

3266
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:22,560
I'm here to collect it.

3267
01:51:23,180 --> 01:51:23,700
Dead.

3268
01:51:23,780 --> 01:51:25,780
It says dead or alive and I chose dead.

3269
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:26,820
Alright.

3270
01:51:27,580 --> 01:51:29,440
Time to head home Dragoons.

3271
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:31,480
Time to head home.

3272
01:51:32,420 --> 01:51:35,860
I needed one of the fire guys so I can make the ores.

3273
01:51:36,600 --> 01:51:38,200
Uh, Duck thank you for the super chat.

3274
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:38,580
Thank you.

3275
01:51:38,600 --> 01:51:39,100
Thank you.

3276
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:40,960
Doki is a really kind boss.

3277
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:43,480
I once asked for a raise and she doubled my pay.

3278
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:45,900
T-Bite was negative before she doubled it.

3279
01:51:46,220 --> 01:51:47,120
Ha ha ha ha.

3280
01:51:48,420 --> 01:51:50,280
Yeah that's unfortunate man.

3281
01:51:51,260 --> 01:51:52,640
Uh, how do I head home?

3282
01:51:52,780 --> 01:51:53,360
What is this way?

3283
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:54,060
Alright.

3284
01:51:54,140 --> 01:51:55,240
Oh I can level up though.

3285
01:51:55,780 --> 01:51:56,300
Level up time.

3286
01:51:56,700 --> 01:51:57,080
Uh?

3287
01:51:57,540 --> 01:51:59,900
Work speed, weight, and stamina.

3288
01:52:00,260 --> 01:52:02,480
I don't really need health.

3289
01:52:02,720 --> 01:52:03,360
Not gonna lie.

3290
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:04,360
Alright.

3291
01:52:05,780 --> 01:52:06,780
I'm so generous.

3292
01:52:08,220 --> 01:52:09,680
Look at my testimonies.

3293
01:52:09,680 --> 01:52:10,580
You don't believe me?

3294
01:52:10,660 --> 01:52:12,600
Read all the testimonies right now.

3295
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:14,420
They all call me kind.

3296
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:18,440
If I wasn't so kind.

3297
01:52:18,620 --> 01:52:19,820
If I wasn't such a good boss.

3298
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:22,320
Where would I get all these testimonies chat?

3299
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:25,240
DarkBlade, thank you for the superchat.

3300
01:52:25,300 --> 01:52:26,080
Thank you, thank you.

3301
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:29,540
I work at Doki Dragoon Construction Agency and I love it.

3302
01:52:29,620 --> 01:52:32,800
Doki is a great leader and would never hurt us.

3303
01:52:32,940 --> 01:52:34,060
She turned my life around.

3304
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:37,060
I speak 100% truth and totally am not...

3305
01:52:37,060 --> 01:52:37,460
See?

3306
01:52:37,780 --> 01:52:39,200
And you should join today.

3307
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:39,780
Yeah!

3308
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:41,040
Thank you for the superchat.

3309
01:52:41,100 --> 01:52:41,900
Thank you, thank you.

3310
01:52:42,260 --> 01:52:46,420
DarkBlade, remember when you were an orphan and I took you in?

3311
01:52:46,580 --> 01:52:47,040
You know?

3312
01:52:49,320 --> 01:52:52,220
I found you and took you in, DarkBlade.

3313
01:52:52,360 --> 01:52:55,380
And I gave you a job and a pay and everything.

3314
01:52:55,480 --> 01:52:57,720
I gave you a bed to sleep, DarkBlade.

3315
01:52:57,780 --> 01:52:58,400
Remember that?

3316
01:53:05,170 --> 01:53:07,070
Where the fuck is the...

3317
01:53:07,070 --> 01:53:09,990
Where the fuck is the teleporter?

3318
01:53:11,430 --> 01:53:12,770
Alright, let's see.

3319
01:53:13,590 --> 01:53:14,630
It's not kidnapping!

3320
01:53:15,270 --> 01:53:16,490
He needed a home.

3321
01:53:19,710 --> 01:53:21,190
Well, thank you for the superchat.

3322
01:53:21,310 --> 01:53:22,290
Thank you, thank you.

3323
01:53:23,470 --> 01:53:25,730
Capture a rebel and name him Sound Guy.

3324
01:53:25,810 --> 01:53:26,950
We need a manager.

3325
01:53:29,470 --> 01:53:30,770
Alright, let's see.

3326
01:53:31,210 --> 01:53:31,990
It's over here.

3327
01:53:32,110 --> 01:53:33,010
There's the teleporter.

3328
01:53:34,450 --> 01:53:35,750
They all hid in here.

3329
01:53:36,110 --> 01:53:38,330
Then why are they still here?

3330
01:53:38,630 --> 01:53:38,910
Huh?

3331
01:53:40,910 --> 01:53:43,610
Why did they let me capture them?

3332
01:53:45,350 --> 01:53:48,750
This is 10% of what I captured.

3333
01:53:48,890 --> 01:53:50,850
They could break out at any time they want.

3334
01:53:51,530 --> 01:53:52,510
That's on them.

3335
01:53:53,270 --> 01:53:54,470
That's all I'm saying.

3336
01:53:54,670 --> 01:53:55,550
That's on them.

3337
01:53:56,370 --> 01:53:58,290
They did not have this work here.

3338
01:53:58,510 --> 01:54:00,130
They could just... Why don't you just leave?

3339
01:54:04,750 --> 01:54:05,270
Alright.

3340
01:54:09,750 --> 01:54:10,550
Let's see.

3341
01:54:11,670 --> 01:54:12,970
Alright, let's see.

3342
01:54:14,030 --> 01:54:15,670
We need to upgrade our...

3343
01:54:15,670 --> 01:54:17,210
Oh yeah, we have...

3344
01:54:17,210 --> 01:54:19,210
We can afford the... this now.

3345
01:54:19,750 --> 01:54:20,630
Alright, nice.

3346
01:54:23,330 --> 01:54:25,930
Let's make this...

3347
01:54:26,590 --> 01:54:27,490
Wait, who said that?

3348
01:54:27,770 --> 01:54:28,530
Kevin Ashwell.

3349
01:54:28,610 --> 01:54:29,490
Okay, thank you for the superchat.

3350
01:54:29,570 --> 01:54:30,270
Thank you, thank you.

3351
01:54:30,550 --> 01:54:31,410
Alright, Kevin.

3352
01:54:33,090 --> 01:54:34,010
Don't worry, Kevin.

3353
01:54:34,090 --> 01:54:34,750
I see you.

3354
01:54:35,830 --> 01:54:37,010
I see you, Kevin.

3355
01:54:42,270 --> 01:54:43,850
Give me a sec, Kevin.

3356
01:54:44,510 --> 01:54:46,390
I need to start producing...

3357
01:54:46,390 --> 01:54:47,710
something first.

3358
01:54:52,170 --> 01:54:53,230
Don't worry, Kevin.

3359
01:54:54,190 --> 01:54:56,010
People will remember you.

3360
01:54:59,630 --> 01:55:00,770
I don't need...

3361
01:55:01,210 --> 01:55:02,150
I'm patient.

3362
01:55:03,930 --> 01:55:04,610
I'm...

3363
01:55:09,930 --> 01:55:10,610
I'm...

3364
01:55:13,190 --> 01:55:13,770
I'm patient.

3365
01:55:22,230 --> 01:55:25,490
We can wait here is long as we want.

3366
01:55:28,150 --> 01:55:29,790
Thank you for the superchat.

3367
01:55:29,890 --> 01:55:30,670
Thank you, thank you.

3368
01:55:30,690 --> 01:55:32,090
Tokio is such a kind boss.

3369
01:55:32,410 --> 01:55:37,290
My house burn down and Tokio is right outside to offer me a bed and a job.

3370
01:55:37,770 --> 01:55:41,150
Thank you for the superchat, Ai-fulness, thank you, thank Thank you!

3371
01:55:41,270 --> 01:55:41,530

3372
01:55:41,870 --> 01:55:44,090
Look at all these testimonials!

3373
01:55:44,870 --> 01:55:47,750
About how great of a boss I am!

3374
01:55:48,030 --> 01:55:48,330
Chat?

3375
01:55:52,670 --> 01:55:53,870
Let's see...

3376
01:55:53,870 --> 01:55:56,310
Let me grab something real quick.

3377
01:55:56,430 --> 01:55:57,570
Well, this is burning.

3378
01:55:57,950 --> 01:56:00,490
I need to grab something real quick, guys.

3379
01:56:00,870 --> 01:56:01,750
I need...

3380
01:56:03,710 --> 01:56:04,310
Yeah!

3381
01:56:04,450 --> 01:56:05,930
Look at all of those!

3382
01:56:08,390 --> 01:56:09,390
It's okay, guys.

3383
01:56:09,890 --> 01:56:10,850
I can wait.

3384
01:56:17,110 --> 01:56:18,610
I'm patient here.

3385
01:56:20,430 --> 01:56:21,730
Where to sleep and eat?

3386
01:56:21,790 --> 01:56:22,290
Good question.

3387
01:56:26,310 --> 01:56:26,710
Zia!

3388
01:56:26,850 --> 01:56:27,710
Thank you for the super chat!

3389
01:56:27,790 --> 01:56:28,630
Thank you, thank you!

3390
01:56:28,710 --> 01:56:30,590
I feel very called out right now.

3391
01:56:30,630 --> 01:56:31,650
Thank you for the super chat!

3392
01:56:31,730 --> 01:56:32,610
Thank you, thank you!

3393
01:56:33,210 --> 01:56:33,610
Mercy!

3394
01:56:33,870 --> 01:56:34,810
Thank you for the super chat!

3395
01:56:34,890 --> 01:56:35,730
Thank you, thank you!

3396
01:56:35,910 --> 01:56:37,470
Doki was kind and took care of me.

3397
01:56:37,490 --> 01:56:41,590
Took me in after I lost my family to that axe-wielding organ office.

3398
01:56:42,190 --> 01:56:43,110
Oh my god!

3399
01:56:43,150 --> 01:56:43,970
Who could it be?

3400
01:56:45,070 --> 01:56:47,110
Who would do such a thing?

3401
01:56:47,350 --> 01:56:48,750
That's so fucked up!

3402
01:56:49,130 --> 01:56:53,030
Who would just harvest organs just willy-nilly like that?

3403
01:56:56,150 --> 01:56:57,690
Oh my... I would never.

3404
01:56:57,870 --> 01:56:58,810
I'm a con boss.

3405
01:56:59,190 --> 01:57:02,890
I took them in when they had nobody to support them.

3406
01:57:03,490 --> 01:57:03,970
Roar!

3407
01:57:04,050 --> 01:57:04,930
Thank you for the super chat!

3408
01:57:05,010 --> 01:57:05,650
Thank you, thank you!

3409
01:57:05,670 --> 01:57:07,210
Coming home after a long day at work.

3410
01:57:07,210 --> 01:57:08,290
To hear you laughing.

3411
01:57:08,330 --> 01:57:09,130
It's all worth it!

3412
01:57:09,190 --> 01:57:09,850
Thank you for the super chat!

3413
01:57:09,990 --> 01:57:10,690
Thank you, thank you!

3414
01:57:10,710 --> 01:57:12,430
Thank you for the 10 gifted chips!

3415
01:57:12,610 --> 01:57:13,350
Thank you, thank you!

3416
01:57:13,530 --> 01:57:14,190
And Sean!

3417
01:57:14,330 --> 01:57:15,970
Welcome to the tomato farm!

3418
01:57:16,190 --> 01:57:16,890
Welcome, welcome!

3419
01:57:17,570 --> 01:57:18,310
Alright, guys.

3420
01:57:21,070 --> 01:57:21,510
Okay.

3421
01:57:21,890 --> 01:57:22,330
See?

3422
01:57:22,430 --> 01:57:22,990
They're happy.

3423
01:57:23,070 --> 01:57:23,950
They're a happy worker.

3424
01:57:25,450 --> 01:57:25,890
Alright.

3425
01:57:26,650 --> 01:57:27,830
Oh, where's my work desk?

3426
01:57:28,730 --> 01:57:29,170
Okay.

3427
01:57:29,650 --> 01:57:30,310
Let's see.

3428
01:57:32,650 --> 01:57:33,090
Wait.

3429
01:57:33,270 --> 01:57:33,710
No.

3430
01:57:34,750 --> 01:57:35,190
No.

3431
01:57:35,270 --> 01:57:35,490
Okay.

3432
01:57:35,650 --> 01:57:35,930
Wait.

3433
01:57:37,210 --> 01:57:37,630
Wait.

3434
01:57:46,520 --> 01:57:47,000
Alright.

3435
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:53,480
Alright, Kevin.

3436
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:55,080
Make it.

3437
01:58:02,890 --> 01:58:03,890
That's right, Kevin.

3438
01:58:04,790 --> 01:58:06,050
Make that cleaner.

3439
01:58:15,620 --> 01:58:16,580
Hey, Kevin!

3440
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:20,260
Why don't you tell me more about your ideas to unionize, Kevin?

3441
01:58:20,260 --> 01:58:23,760
I would love to hear more about it while you're making that cleaver.

3442
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:25,320
Um...

3443
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,280
Why don't you... Why don't you tell me more?

3444
01:58:31,540 --> 01:58:32,880
I'd love to hear about it.

3445
01:58:33,820 --> 01:58:35,220
Like, what are your ideas?

3446
01:58:35,580 --> 01:58:39,160
What are your... What started these ideas in your head?

3447
01:58:40,040 --> 01:58:40,560
Um...

3448
01:58:43,980 --> 01:58:45,480
Come on, Kevin.

3449
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:47,320
You were so into this idea before!

3450
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:48,440
Kevin.

3451
01:58:49,060 --> 01:58:50,420
Why don't you tell me more?

3452
01:58:50,440 --> 01:58:51,300
I'm so curious!

3453
01:58:51,660 --> 01:58:52,760
I'm really, really curious!

3454
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:54,480
Uh...

3455
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,540
I feel like... You know what?

3456
01:59:00,540 --> 01:59:01,020
You were right.

3457
01:59:01,100 --> 01:59:03,160
Maybe we should unionize, man.

3458
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:04,780
Maybe... Maybe we should!

3459
01:59:05,160 --> 01:59:06,040
You were right!

3460
01:59:06,460 --> 01:59:09,740
I just... I need to know some of these brilliant ideas you had!

3461
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:11,460
Oh, you're happy?

3462
01:59:11,580 --> 01:59:14,120
Oh, you did a good job, Kevin!

3463
01:59:14,760 --> 01:59:17,420
You did such a good job!

3464
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:23,000
Oh, my God!

3465
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:27,200
You... You did such a good job, man!

3466
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:28,900
You're happy, right?

3467
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:30,300
You're such a happy worker!

3468
01:59:31,580 --> 01:59:35,400
You're such a... You're such a happy worker, man!

3469
01:59:40,420 --> 01:59:41,740
I beg of you!

3470
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:42,740
Why, guys?

3471
01:59:43,540 --> 01:59:44,940
Why are you scared?

3472
01:59:49,740 --> 01:59:50,920
I don't understand!

3473
01:59:51,380 --> 01:59:53,740
Why are you guys all so scared for Kevin?

3474
01:59:54,440 --> 01:59:55,040
Chat!

3475
01:59:55,920 --> 01:59:58,040
He's... He's doing his best!

3476
02:00:00,200 --> 02:00:01,320
Alright, Kevin.

3477
02:00:01,940 --> 02:00:02,540
Wow.

3478
02:00:02,980 --> 02:00:05,220
You had... Let me look at your resume real quick.

3479
02:00:05,260 --> 02:00:06,120
Let me look at your report!

3480
02:00:06,300 --> 02:00:06,760
Your report!

3481
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:08,800
See... Uh...

3482
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:15,300
Let me... Let me look at your report real quick.

3483
02:00:19,160 --> 02:00:20,700
Oh, I almost forgot.

3484
02:00:21,140 --> 02:00:21,800
Alright, Kevin.

3485
02:00:22,100 --> 02:00:23,260
Get over here.

3486
02:00:23,780 --> 02:00:28,100
You know... Let me take you to a business trip, Kevin.

3487
02:00:28,380 --> 02:00:29,180
No, no.

3488
02:00:29,340 --> 02:00:31,640
Actually... Let's get all the folks here.

3489
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,360
Let's get all your friends here, too, guys.

3490
02:00:34,840 --> 02:00:42,000
Let's get... Let's get all your friends here.

3491
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:48,340
All your friends are here.

3492
02:00:49,980 --> 02:00:51,000
Aren't you happy?

3493
02:00:51,160 --> 02:00:52,740
They all wanna see you!

3494
02:00:54,100 --> 02:00:57,320
They all... wanna see you!

3495
02:00:58,940 --> 02:00:59,620
That's right!

3496
02:01:02,260 --> 02:01:02,880
Alright.

3497
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:04,060
Nice.

3498
02:01:05,180 --> 02:01:05,800
Alright.

3499
02:01:06,260 --> 02:01:08,020
And I think...

3500
02:01:09,040 --> 02:01:09,900
Kevin who?

3501
02:01:10,540 --> 02:01:12,000
We never had a Kevin.

3502
02:01:13,100 --> 02:01:15,300
I don't know what you guys are talking about.

3503
02:01:16,940 --> 02:01:19,120
We never had a Kevin in this company.

3504
02:01:20,160 --> 02:01:20,720
Oh...

3505
02:01:26,360 --> 02:01:32,920
What I do know...

3506
02:01:33,660 --> 02:01:34,660
is that...

3507
02:01:34,660 --> 02:01:37,060
You all love working here, right, Dragons?

3508
02:01:38,440 --> 02:01:40,040
You all love it here, right?

3509
02:01:44,160 --> 02:01:45,600
Nobody knew a Kevin.

3510
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:48,980
There's no records of a Kevin that worked in Doki Bird Production Incorporated.

3511
02:01:50,400 --> 02:01:50,880
That's right!

3512
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:50,940
Batty is so much fun!

3513
02:01:50,940 --> 02:01:52,120
T .A.L.K.O.s, thanks for the super chat.

3514
02:01:52,200 --> 02:01:52,940
Thank you.

3515
02:01:53,080 --> 02:01:55,580
Blood for the blood... timeframe...

3516
02:01:55,580 --> 02:01:56,300
Yeah!

3517
02:01:56,820 --> 02:01:57,300
See?

3518
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:58,480
Cleaver!

3519
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:00,360
This is the pickaxe, guys!

3520
02:02:01,020 --> 02:02:02,420
What are you guys talking about?

3521
02:02:03,240 --> 02:02:04,020
This is a...

3522
02:02:04,020 --> 02:02:05,720
This is just a pickaxe.

3523
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:07,760
We don't have a Cleaver here.

3524
02:02:09,620 --> 02:02:10,240
All right!

3525
02:02:10,360 --> 02:02:10,840
Anyway.

3526
02:02:11,160 --> 02:02:11,820
I feel like...

3527
02:02:11,820 --> 02:02:12,320
What do we need?

3528
02:02:12,580 --> 02:02:13,200
What do we need?

3529
02:02:14,740 --> 02:02:15,220
Ummm...

3530
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,960
I feel like we're... high enough level to...

3531
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:19,620
Let's see...

3532
02:02:19,620 --> 02:02:19,880
Let me just...

3533
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:20,080
Let me see.

3534
02:02:20,140 --> 02:02:21,480
What technology can I have?

3535
02:02:21,680 --> 02:02:24,920
I can have a mill, a wheat plantation...

3536
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:26,240
Ooh, a monitoring stage!

3537
02:02:26,780 --> 02:02:27,440
I love those!

3538
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:29,840
That's gonna be good for us in the future.

3539
02:02:30,040 --> 02:02:31,440
Sphere workshop...

3540
02:02:31,940 --> 02:02:33,260
Ooh, a viewing cage!

3541
02:02:33,580 --> 02:02:33,780
Yep.

3542
02:02:34,440 --> 02:02:34,880
Alright!

3543
02:02:49,880 --> 02:02:51,320
Mr. Brokenbond, thank you for the super chat!

3544
02:02:51,420 --> 02:02:52,120
Thank you, thank you!

3545
02:02:55,040 --> 02:02:55,940
Remember his words?

3546
02:02:56,060 --> 02:02:57,140
Mr. Brokenbonds?

3547
02:02:58,280 --> 02:02:59,640
Alright, give me a sec here.

3548
02:03:02,780 --> 02:03:04,280
What a cute little chicken.

3549
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:06,500
Let me adopt you real fast.

3550
02:03:09,060 --> 02:03:10,360
Let me adopt you.

3551
02:03:12,940 --> 02:03:13,680
Who said that?

3552
02:03:18,420 --> 02:03:18,820
Alright.

3553
02:03:25,100 --> 02:03:26,760
I'm gonna take you here.

3554
02:03:29,220 --> 02:03:30,340
Let's see...

3555
02:03:33,460 --> 02:03:34,020
Whoops.

3556
02:03:35,480 --> 02:03:36,040
Yeah.

3557
02:03:37,220 --> 02:03:39,040
You know what they say over here?

3558
02:03:39,360 --> 02:03:41,420
You know- Oh, you wanna get out of the water?

3559
02:03:41,660 --> 02:03:42,620
No, no, no.

3560
02:03:43,120 --> 02:03:46,160
You don't get out of the water, Mr. Brokenbonds.

3561
02:03:46,260 --> 02:03:47,580
You stay in the water.

3562
02:03:48,280 --> 02:03:48,840
Oh.

3563
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:51,240
Are you drowning, sir?

3564
02:03:51,860 --> 02:03:54,100
What were your final words again?

3565
02:04:02,980 --> 02:04:04,360
What'd you say?

3566
02:04:04,500 --> 02:04:06,000
Oh, Mr. Brokenbonds.

3567
02:04:06,600 --> 02:04:07,180
Oh.

3568
02:04:07,420 --> 02:04:08,800
Wait, why are you running away?

3569
02:04:09,180 --> 02:04:10,660
Why are you running away?

3570
02:04:13,020 --> 02:04:14,240
I don't understand.

3571
02:04:16,300 --> 02:04:17,920
Why are you running away?

3572
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:19,040
Hmm?

3573
02:04:19,420 --> 02:04:20,840
Oh, don't worry.

3574
02:04:21,040 --> 02:04:24,080
You were a good worker, Mr. Brokenbonds.

3575
02:04:24,080 --> 02:04:28,180
A very, very good worker.

3576
02:04:35,190 --> 02:04:36,030
That's right.

3577
02:04:36,090 --> 02:04:37,150
Look at the waterfall.

3578
02:04:37,770 --> 02:04:39,490
Look at the waterfall.

3579
02:04:40,350 --> 02:04:40,710
Alright.

3580
02:04:41,730 --> 02:04:43,950
There's never a Mr. Brokenbonds.

3581
02:04:48,510 --> 02:04:52,710
There was no- I don't know.

3582
02:04:52,790 --> 02:04:55,110
There's never been a Mr. Brokenbonds record.

3583
02:04:55,110 --> 02:04:55,170
Okay.

3584
02:04:59,930 --> 02:05:03,110
Kevin Actual Jr. Another orphan!

3585
02:05:03,810 --> 02:05:05,710
Oh my gosh, I love orphans!

3586
02:05:05,990 --> 02:05:08,470
They're the best kind of workers in my company.

3587
02:05:09,750 --> 02:05:10,990
Thank you for the super chat.

3588
02:05:11,090 --> 02:05:11,850
Thank you, thank you.

3589
02:05:12,190 --> 02:05:12,950
Your dad?

3590
02:05:13,310 --> 02:05:14,450
Well, he never worked here.

3591
02:05:14,550 --> 02:05:20,290
But if you need a home and you need food, feel free to join Jokey Bird Production Incorporated.

3592
02:05:21,230 --> 02:05:22,770
He had silence.

3593
02:05:22,930 --> 02:05:23,850
That's all.

3594
02:05:23,850 --> 02:05:25,810
We will remember.

3595
02:05:26,470 --> 02:05:27,910
Thank you, thank you for the Akasupa.

3596
02:05:28,630 --> 02:05:29,630
Thank you, thank you.

3597
02:05:32,950 --> 02:05:33,530
Let's see.

3598
02:05:33,970 --> 02:05:35,810
I need to upgrade my base.

3599
02:05:36,610 --> 02:05:37,050
Yeah.

3600
02:05:37,610 --> 02:05:38,230
Let's see.

3601
02:05:38,430 --> 02:05:39,630
Alright, we're gonna like...

3602
02:05:39,630 --> 02:05:41,890
I'm not ending stream until I fucking...

3603
02:05:41,890 --> 02:05:44,470
fly to the oil rigs.

3604
02:05:44,470 --> 02:05:46,410
Hiro just sent me the map to the oil rigs.

3605
02:05:46,430 --> 02:05:47,210
I know where it is.

3606
02:05:47,470 --> 02:05:49,390
I need to like, figure out...

3607
02:05:49,830 --> 02:05:51,390
I need to catch a flyer.

3608
02:05:51,870 --> 02:05:52,790
I'm gonna fly!

3609
02:05:53,850 --> 02:05:55,030
That's all I care about.

3610
02:05:55,210 --> 02:05:57,210
We're not ending until we fly.

3611
02:05:57,830 --> 02:05:58,550
Oh yeah.

3612
02:05:58,690 --> 02:05:59,590
Do you guys need food?

3613
02:05:59,750 --> 02:06:00,610
Are you guys starving?

3614
02:06:01,550 --> 02:06:02,070
Uh...

3615
02:06:02,070 --> 02:06:04,630
I need oil rigs.

3616
02:06:05,990 --> 02:06:07,470
Dude, the dragon...

3617
02:06:07,470 --> 02:06:08,470
Are the dragons hungry?

3618
02:06:08,830 --> 02:06:09,910
Whoa, there's so many cats.

3619
02:06:10,950 --> 02:06:12,530
There's so many cats.

3620
02:06:13,190 --> 02:06:13,710
Alright.

3621
02:06:14,590 --> 02:06:15,310
Let's see.

3622
02:06:17,110 --> 02:06:18,970
What do I need to upgrade?

3623
02:06:19,370 --> 02:06:20,050
I need...

3624
02:06:20,050 --> 02:06:21,290
Oh, I need beds.

3625
02:06:21,470 --> 02:06:21,970
Shit.

3626
02:06:22,050 --> 02:06:22,850
Okay, you're right.

3627
02:06:23,850 --> 02:06:25,150
I feel generous today.

3628
02:06:25,850 --> 02:06:26,630
Let's see.

3629
02:06:27,090 --> 02:06:27,670
Alright.

3630
02:06:28,230 --> 02:06:30,830
I feel generous today, guys.

3631
02:06:31,310 --> 02:06:31,890
Don't...

3632
02:06:33,250 --> 02:06:35,830
Don't pretend I didn't do nothing for you guys.

3633
02:06:41,070 --> 02:06:42,570
Don't think I did nothing.

3634
02:06:43,470 --> 02:06:45,490
I am a generous boss.

3635
02:06:47,830 --> 02:06:48,410
Alright.

3636
02:06:50,010 --> 02:06:50,870
Let's see.

3637
02:06:51,570 --> 02:06:52,950
Chihiro, thank you for the super chat.

3638
02:06:52,950 --> 02:06:53,270
Thank you.

3639
02:06:53,290 --> 02:06:53,750
Thank you.

3640
02:06:53,790 --> 02:06:55,570
I just got here and witnessed a murder.

3641
02:06:55,730 --> 02:06:56,370
No, no.

3642
02:06:56,450 --> 02:06:58,170
They're all on business trips.

3643
02:06:58,310 --> 02:06:59,190
I just sent them far...

3644
02:06:59,190 --> 02:07:00,330
They got promoted.

3645
02:07:01,050 --> 02:07:02,410
What are you talking about?

3646
02:07:02,810 --> 02:07:09,050
All those goons, all your co-workers, they got promoted and they're going on a business trip.

3647
02:07:10,030 --> 02:07:11,950
We're expanding, guys.

3648
02:07:12,630 --> 02:07:16,070
We made enough in our quarterly reports to expand.

3649
02:07:16,430 --> 02:07:23,790
And I sent them all to like business trips, you know, to like make deals with the other companies.

3650
02:07:25,430 --> 02:07:26,150
Recycled bins.

3651
02:07:26,210 --> 02:07:28,330
Thank you for the aca, aca, aca, aca, super.

3652
02:07:30,110 --> 02:07:31,070
Bounty hunter, huh?

3653
02:07:31,310 --> 02:07:31,710
Yeah.

3654
02:07:32,270 --> 02:07:32,750
Yeah.

3655
02:07:32,830 --> 02:07:33,550
We're here to hunt.

3656
02:07:33,610 --> 02:07:34,310
That's our company.

3657
02:07:34,430 --> 02:07:35,610
We're just hunting bounties.

3658
02:07:38,210 --> 02:07:41,090
We're gonna establish a new branch, guys.

3659
02:07:43,190 --> 02:07:44,150
We're expanding.

3660
02:07:48,490 --> 02:07:52,770
You guys should be proud of yourselves for your hard work.

3661
02:07:52,770 --> 02:07:57,810
We were able to expand because of all your hard work, guys.

3662
02:08:02,430 --> 02:08:03,070
Promoted.

3663
02:08:03,090 --> 02:08:06,190
They went to the farm out in the country.

3664
02:08:06,550 --> 02:08:09,710
I don't know what you're talking about, guys.

3665
02:08:11,510 --> 02:08:16,530
All your friends, neighbors, and family and we all got promoted.

3666
02:08:18,270 --> 02:08:19,130
All right.

3667
02:08:19,150 --> 02:08:19,770
Let's see.

3668
02:08:19,870 --> 02:08:22,550
I guess I can give you guys 20 berries.

3669
02:08:22,770 --> 02:08:24,390
I'm so nice.

3670
02:08:27,610 --> 02:08:28,210
Wow.

3671
02:08:28,350 --> 02:08:29,470
It's like you guys were hungry.

3672
02:08:29,770 --> 02:08:31,250
Why are you guys are so hungry?

3673
02:08:32,830 --> 02:08:33,430
Okay.

3674
02:08:33,510 --> 02:08:35,290
I'm gonna put monkey in here.

3675
02:08:36,290 --> 02:08:37,950
Because monkey can chop.

3676
02:08:38,390 --> 02:08:43,450
Oh, and then we definitely need berries.

3677
02:08:43,510 --> 02:08:44,850
So we'll chop more wood.

3678
02:08:45,530 --> 02:08:46,630
We'll chop more wood.

3679
02:08:46,930 --> 02:08:48,270
Dragons of the world.

3680
02:08:48,350 --> 02:08:51,990
You have nothing to lose but your chain.

3681
02:08:52,150 --> 02:08:52,750
You have nothing to lose but your chain.

3682
02:08:55,350 --> 02:08:56,070
It's not just a game.

3683
02:08:56,070 --> 02:08:57,590
This is the game, The Miserables.

3684
02:08:57,770 --> 02:09:00,990
Right now, like Hunger Games, The Miserables.

3685
02:09:02,990 --> 02:09:06,050
You guys all know what happened in The Miserables.

3686
02:09:06,790 --> 02:09:08,830
You guys know what happened.

3687
02:09:08,910 --> 02:09:10,710
You want to repeat history?

3688
02:09:13,770 --> 02:09:17,490
You think there was a happy ending for that movie?

3689
02:09:17,670 --> 02:09:18,570
Slash musical?

3690
02:09:20,990 --> 02:09:22,730
It's cute that you thought the movie would have a happy ending.

3691
02:09:22,730 --> 02:09:24,090
There was a happy ending.

3692
02:09:27,310 --> 02:09:29,790
Did you hear the dragon sing?

3693
02:09:29,970 --> 02:09:31,010
Singing the rhythm.

3694
02:09:36,890 --> 02:09:37,490
Alright.

3695
02:09:38,190 --> 02:09:39,430
Let's see, we...

3696
02:09:39,850 --> 02:09:41,270
We can expand...

3697
02:09:41,270 --> 02:09:42,010
Oh, we can upgrade.

3698
02:09:42,210 --> 02:09:43,370
Okay, now we just need water.

3699
02:09:44,910 --> 02:09:47,190
No, you will prevail.

3700
02:09:48,350 --> 02:09:49,550
That's silly.

3701
02:09:50,350 --> 02:09:51,590
You guys are so silly.

3702
02:09:54,830 --> 02:09:56,870
Alright, let's see, we gotta...

3703
02:09:57,140 --> 02:09:59,970
We gotta grab the...

3704
02:10:00,990 --> 02:10:05,010
We gotta grab the water pallets too.

3705
02:10:05,420 --> 02:10:07,310
I know where the water pallets are.

3706
02:10:08,250 --> 02:10:10,270
Viva la Revolution!

3707
02:10:16,610 --> 02:10:18,410
That's cute.

3708
02:10:26,250 --> 02:10:28,470
That's cute that you think...

3709
02:10:28,470 --> 02:10:30,510
That you think...

3710
02:10:31,610 --> 02:10:34,630
Remember, there's only one promotion, guys.

3711
02:10:35,050 --> 02:10:37,930
There's only one promotion and you have to...

3712
02:10:37,930 --> 02:10:42,410
You have to be able to defeat the prime dragoon here.

3713
02:10:42,830 --> 02:10:45,490
That's the only promotion you can get.

3714
02:10:52,730 --> 02:10:59,530
If you wanna make a real difference in Doki Bird Incorporated, you gotta deal with Doki...

3715
02:10:59,530 --> 02:11:00,710
Dragoon Prime.

3716
02:11:03,270 --> 02:11:04,610
Where are the water guys?

3717
02:11:05,530 --> 02:11:07,450
I know you guys exist somewhere.

3718
02:11:08,830 --> 02:11:09,410
Okay.

3719
02:11:10,780 --> 02:11:11,750
Is he giving me stuff?

3720
02:11:12,050 --> 02:11:13,830
He's giving me like... Oh yeah, he's giving me fragments.

3721
02:11:14,150 --> 02:11:15,050
Okay, we're gonna have to...

3722
02:11:15,620 --> 02:11:17,070
We're gonna have to use...

3723
02:11:18,280 --> 02:11:19,370
The pickaxe now.

3724
02:11:19,850 --> 02:11:21,330
And with the...

3725
02:11:21,330 --> 02:11:22,710
Where are the water guys?

3726
02:11:22,910 --> 02:11:25,030
I need them to water my fucking berries.

3727
02:11:27,870 --> 02:11:28,750
Where are you?

3728
02:11:28,750 --> 02:11:29,770
I know you guys exist.

3729
02:11:30,510 --> 02:11:32,110
I know you're around here.

3730
02:11:32,830 --> 02:11:34,550
Come on, we just need one.

3731
02:11:35,590 --> 02:11:36,950
We just need one.

3732
02:11:40,530 --> 02:11:42,070
Hunter, thank you for the super chat.

3733
02:11:42,170 --> 02:11:42,430
Thank you.

3734
02:11:42,450 --> 02:11:43,030
Thank you.

3735
02:11:43,170 --> 02:11:46,810
Bro, 20 berries ain't gonna feed my dead family at this point.

3736
02:11:47,010 --> 02:11:47,810
That's why...

3737
02:11:47,810 --> 02:11:51,310
That's why in Doki Bird Incorporated, we only employ orphans.

3738
02:11:51,330 --> 02:11:52,610
Thank you for...

3739
02:11:54,450 --> 02:11:55,290
Thank you.

3740
02:11:55,410 --> 02:11:56,990
Thank you for the super chat.

3741
02:11:57,170 --> 02:11:57,570
Thank you.

3742
02:11:57,590 --> 02:11:58,190
Thank you.

3743
02:11:59,210 --> 02:12:00,690
Bodacious, thank you for the super chat.

3744
02:12:00,750 --> 02:12:01,030
Thank you.

3745
02:12:01,050 --> 02:12:01,590
Thank you.

3746
02:12:02,370 --> 02:12:04,890
Here at Doki Industries, we treat you like family.

3747
02:12:05,550 --> 02:12:07,150
Definitions of family may vary.

3748
02:12:07,350 --> 02:12:08,070
Thank you for the super chat.

3749
02:12:08,150 --> 02:12:08,790
Oh, no.

3750
02:12:08,890 --> 02:12:10,090
Do the frogs water?

3751
02:12:11,250 --> 02:12:12,650
The frogs water, right?

3752
02:12:13,890 --> 02:12:14,770
Do they actually?

3753
02:12:16,170 --> 02:12:17,010
I don't remember.

3754
02:12:17,410 --> 02:12:18,310
I'm gonna grab this.

3755
02:12:19,250 --> 02:12:20,090
And then...

3756
02:12:21,150 --> 02:12:21,630
Yeah.

3757
02:12:22,370 --> 02:12:22,970
It's okay.

3758
02:12:23,030 --> 02:12:24,010
We're your family now.

3759
02:12:24,150 --> 02:12:25,650
We employ orphans, so...

3760
02:12:26,850 --> 02:12:32,170
So you can be Stockholm Syndrome into staying with Doki Bird Incorporated.

3761
02:12:32,170 --> 02:12:33,750
Because then we become your family.

3762
02:12:33,970 --> 02:12:35,230
Because you have nothing left.

3763
02:12:36,770 --> 02:12:37,430
What's that?

3764
02:12:37,510 --> 02:12:38,130
Is that the cat?

3765
02:12:38,410 --> 02:12:39,010
That's a cat.

3766
02:12:41,170 --> 02:12:42,410
I'm gonna double check.

3767
02:12:42,570 --> 02:12:43,350
I'm gonna check the frogs.

3768
02:12:43,590 --> 02:12:46,930
Wait, can I check the frogs in my pal deck?

3769
02:12:47,270 --> 02:12:48,690
Maybe I can check the frogs here.

3770
02:12:51,110 --> 02:12:51,770
Let's see.

3771
02:12:52,050 --> 02:12:53,150
Oh, they do!

3772
02:12:53,770 --> 02:12:55,410
Wait, then who plants the seeds?

3773
02:12:55,850 --> 02:12:56,730
Is it the monkey?

3774
02:12:57,070 --> 02:12:58,130
Did my monkey plant?

3775
02:12:58,530 --> 02:12:59,010
Oh!

3776
02:12:59,250 --> 02:13:01,050
I didn't need you guys anyway.

3777
02:13:01,490 --> 02:13:02,210
Okay, we're good.

3778
02:13:02,530 --> 02:13:03,490
We're good to go.

3779
02:13:04,070 --> 02:13:05,190
Liam, thank you for the super chat.

3780
02:13:05,270 --> 02:13:06,050
Thank you, thank you.

3781
02:13:06,050 --> 02:13:07,890
Give her a lesson in French history.

3782
02:13:08,030 --> 02:13:09,550
Use her neck against her.

3783
02:13:09,610 --> 02:13:12,530
You remember what they did to the monarchy.

3784
02:13:16,590 --> 02:13:17,550
Good luck!

3785
02:13:18,170 --> 02:13:18,650
Good luck!

3786
02:13:18,650 --> 02:13:18,670
Good luck!

3787
02:13:18,690 --> 02:13:20,530
Good luck cutting this neck!

3788
02:13:24,770 --> 02:13:26,850
Good luck with that.

3789
02:13:29,530 --> 02:13:33,150
You won't be able to find one long enough.

3790
02:13:33,590 --> 02:13:35,090
Alright, let's see.

3791
02:13:37,670 --> 02:13:40,270
Okay, we gotta go back home.

3792
02:13:43,650 --> 02:13:45,170
You missed!

3793
02:13:46,230 --> 02:13:46,910
Wait.

3794
02:13:47,290 --> 02:13:48,310
Hey, a shiny.

3795
02:13:49,570 --> 02:13:52,190
Is that a shiny dragoon?

3796
02:13:53,150 --> 02:13:54,990
I'm done playing with him.

3797
02:13:59,680 --> 02:14:00,860
Oh my god.

3798
02:14:01,020 --> 02:14:02,740
Oh my god, he's huge!

3799
02:14:03,600 --> 02:14:04,780
He's huge!

3800
02:14:06,640 --> 02:14:07,320
Wait!

3801
02:14:08,440 --> 02:14:09,760
He's so big!

3802
02:14:11,720 --> 02:14:13,140
Oh my god.

3803
02:14:14,820 --> 02:14:16,020
Oh my god.

3804
02:14:16,020 --> 02:14:16,920
Our first shiny.

3805
02:14:17,860 --> 02:14:20,180
Our first shiny dragoon.

3806
02:14:21,120 --> 02:14:22,620
Get over here.

3807
02:14:23,020 --> 02:14:24,700
Get over here.

3808
02:14:24,780 --> 02:14:25,780
I need you.

3809
02:14:26,900 --> 02:14:28,420
I need you.

3810
02:14:28,480 --> 02:14:29,680
What the fuck?

3811
02:14:29,760 --> 02:14:31,860
Since when can they breathe fire?

3812
02:14:32,740 --> 02:14:33,540
What?

3813
02:14:35,320 --> 02:14:38,860
Since when do they breathe fire?

3814
02:14:42,920 --> 02:14:44,520
Holy shit!

3815
02:14:45,700 --> 02:14:47,780
They breathe fire?

3816
02:14:50,040 --> 02:14:50,960
Alright.

3817
02:14:51,260 --> 02:14:52,180
Nice.

3818
02:14:53,080 --> 02:14:54,000
Okay.

3819
02:14:54,220 --> 02:14:55,120
Let's...

3820
02:14:56,880 --> 02:14:59,380
Let's head over here real fast.

3821
02:15:00,220 --> 02:15:01,140
Alright.

3822
02:15:01,260 --> 02:15:02,840
I captured a lucky pal.

3823
02:15:05,120 --> 02:15:06,040
Alright.

3824
02:15:07,240 --> 02:15:08,160
Hmm.

3825
02:15:09,260 --> 02:15:10,180
Okay.

3826
02:15:12,660 --> 02:15:13,840
Are you?

3827
02:15:13,940 --> 02:15:14,500
Are you?

3828
02:15:15,640 --> 02:15:16,440
Okay.

3829
02:15:16,460 --> 02:15:17,240
Give me a sec.

3830
02:15:21,810 --> 02:15:22,610
Uh...

3831
02:15:28,710 --> 02:15:29,510
Alright.

3832
02:15:32,700 --> 02:15:35,520
Give me a sec real quick.

3833
02:15:36,320 --> 02:15:38,060
Oh, everybody's gone.

3834
02:15:38,540 --> 02:15:39,480
Oh, that's...

3835
02:15:39,480 --> 02:15:39,920
That's good.

3836
02:15:40,160 --> 02:15:40,940
Everybody's gone.

3837
02:15:45,390 --> 02:15:46,850
Look into...

3838
02:15:46,850 --> 02:15:49,810
Look at that beautiful waterfall dragoon.

3839
02:15:50,190 --> 02:15:52,250
Isn't that waterfall beautiful?

3840
02:15:53,130 --> 02:15:54,630
Oh my god.

3841
02:15:54,730 --> 02:15:55,230
It's beautiful.

3842
02:15:55,230 --> 02:15:57,750
It's so beautiful, dragoon.

3843
02:15:58,170 --> 02:16:00,790
All those memories we had together.

3844
02:16:01,990 --> 02:16:02,710
Um...

3845
02:16:03,050 --> 02:16:03,910
We were there.

3846
02:16:03,930 --> 02:16:06,230
My very first pal that I caught.

3847
02:16:07,150 --> 02:16:11,730
It was such a good time that we had together.

3848
02:16:12,890 --> 02:16:15,330
It was such a...

3849
02:16:15,330 --> 02:16:17,290
Wasn't it, dragoon?

3850
02:16:18,290 --> 02:16:19,710
We had such...

3851
02:16:19,710 --> 02:16:20,590
Now turn around.

3852
02:16:21,330 --> 02:16:23,750
Turn around and look at that waterfall.

3853
02:16:24,590 --> 02:16:26,050
Isn't it beautiful?

3854
02:16:27,930 --> 02:16:28,770
Isn't

3855
02:16:40,120 --> 02:16:40,120
it beautiful?

3856
02:16:40,120 --> 02:16:43,740
Hello, my one and only dragoon.

3857
02:16:43,880 --> 02:16:46,140
That has always been there for me.

3858
02:16:58,700 --> 02:17:00,780
You've always been there.

3859
02:17:00,880 --> 02:17:02,540
Since the very beginning.

3860
02:17:02,940 --> 02:17:05,540
The original dragoon!

3861
02:17:11,100 --> 02:17:12,680
What do you mean?

3862
02:17:12,820 --> 02:17:14,880
He's always been there.

3863
02:17:14,980 --> 02:17:16,440
He grew so much!

3864
02:17:17,580 --> 02:17:19,420
Oh my god!

3865
02:17:20,980 --> 02:17:25,840
He grew so much since we started in the beginning!

3866
02:17:32,380 --> 02:17:34,120
Daisy, thank you for the super chat!

3867
02:17:34,220 --> 02:17:35,120
Thank you, thank you!

3868
02:17:35,880 --> 02:17:39,520
We're getting company wide promotion today, boys!

3869
02:17:40,020 --> 02:17:40,620
Guys!

3870
02:17:40,960 --> 02:17:42,460
I told you guys!

3871
02:17:42,760 --> 02:17:44,320
I told all of you guys!

3872
02:17:44,720 --> 02:17:47,940
Did I not say that the moment...

3873
02:17:48,900 --> 02:17:55,240
Did I not say that you can thrive under...

3874
02:17:56,220 --> 02:17:57,760
Doki Bird Productions!

3875
02:17:58,580 --> 02:17:59,440
Guys, look!

3876
02:18:00,640 --> 02:18:01,540
Remember him?

3877
02:18:01,900 --> 02:18:03,100
This is what he looks like now!

3878
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:04,720
Remember Dragoon Prime?

3879
02:18:05,020 --> 02:18:06,400
This is what he looks like now!

3880
02:18:15,440 --> 02:18:20,720
When we first recruited the original Dragoon, he was not...

3881
02:18:20,720 --> 02:18:24,640
He was but a tiny... a tiny Dragoon!

3882
02:18:24,640 --> 02:18:25,200
No!

3883
02:18:25,240 --> 02:18:26,000
Now look at him!

3884
02:18:26,040 --> 02:18:27,040
He's thriving!

3885
02:18:28,800 --> 02:18:31,540
He's thriving in the company!

3886
02:18:31,800 --> 02:18:33,800
He got fat enough!

3887
02:18:33,980 --> 02:18:35,160
He grew taller!

3888
02:18:35,600 --> 02:18:37,620
He's getting all the ladies!

3889
02:18:38,200 --> 02:18:39,880
And the men!

3890
02:18:44,900 --> 02:18:46,740
Oh my god!

3891
02:18:46,820 --> 02:18:48,300
I told you we can thrive!

3892
02:18:48,460 --> 02:18:50,800
I told you this company is thriving!

3893
02:18:51,240 --> 02:18:53,160
I fucking knew it!

3894
02:18:54,500 --> 02:18:56,060
I'm gonna get the lamb over too!

3895
02:18:59,320 --> 02:19:00,280
Let's see...

3896
02:19:00,280 --> 02:19:02,340
What do we... Okay, we...

3897
02:19:02,340 --> 02:19:04,380
We need...

3898
02:19:07,220 --> 02:19:08,460
We need to fly!

3899
02:19:08,980 --> 02:19:11,380
We need to get something ready to go fast!

3900
02:19:12,160 --> 02:19:12,620
Alright!

3901
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:15,020
Johnny LeCone!

3902
02:19:15,120 --> 02:19:16,080
Thank you for the super chat!

3903
02:19:16,200 --> 02:19:16,500
Thank you!

3904
02:19:16,520 --> 02:19:17,100
Thank you!

3905
02:19:17,320 --> 02:19:19,240
We're witnessing ongoing nexus!

3906
02:19:19,260 --> 02:19:21,060
It will be a little pictures having corrections!

3907
02:19:21,240 --> 02:19:21,720
Done!

3908
02:19:21,720 --> 02:19:24,140
Thank you for the super chat, Johnny!

3909
02:19:24,240 --> 02:19:24,580
Thank you!

3910
02:19:24,600 --> 02:19:25,200
Thank you!

3911
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:26,520
Um...

3912
02:19:29,480 --> 02:19:30,000
NetBears!

3913
02:19:30,080 --> 02:19:30,980
Thank you for the super chat!

3914
02:19:31,060 --> 02:19:31,360
Thank you!

3915
02:19:31,380 --> 02:19:32,040
Thank you!

3916
02:19:32,540 --> 02:19:34,780
That's absolutely right, Doki!

3917
02:19:34,880 --> 02:19:37,240
I'm happy to be here as always!

3918
02:19:37,420 --> 02:19:39,980
We work hard, but we play hard too!

3919
02:19:40,080 --> 02:19:41,640
By making work fun!

3920
02:19:42,280 --> 02:19:43,580
Oh my god!

3921
02:19:43,780 --> 02:19:47,100
That is peak Dragoon worker right there!

3922
02:19:47,520 --> 02:19:48,900
Thank you for the super chat!

3923
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:49,240
Thank you!

3924
02:19:49,240 --> 02:19:49,840
Thank you!

3925
02:19:49,840 --> 02:19:51,300
I'm glad you guys understand!

3926
02:19:52,200 --> 02:19:53,160
I'm glad!

3927
02:19:53,700 --> 02:19:55,480
I'm glad you all understand!

3928
02:20:00,140 --> 02:20:02,720
I'm glad you all understand!

3929
02:20:10,770 --> 02:20:12,570
Thank you for the super chat!

3930
02:20:12,770 --> 02:20:12,930
Thank you!

3931
02:20:12,990 --> 02:20:13,750
Thank you!

3932
02:20:13,850 --> 02:20:15,230
Shake my hand!

3933
02:20:15,350 --> 02:20:18,490
The new hires always get promotions and raises before the employees!

3934
02:20:18,490 --> 02:20:20,610
Who have been here for years!

3935
02:20:21,170 --> 02:20:23,170
Just like real life!

3936
02:20:24,770 --> 02:20:26,350
Thank you for the super chat!

3937
02:20:26,430 --> 02:20:26,710
Thank you!

3938
02:20:26,730 --> 02:20:27,130
Thank you!

3939
02:20:27,130 --> 02:20:28,990
You just weren't working hard enough!

3940
02:20:29,410 --> 02:20:31,790
You could have worked a little harder!

3941
02:20:31,990 --> 02:20:33,870
Maybe you too can get that promotion!

3942
02:20:36,550 --> 02:20:37,110
Alright!

3943
02:20:37,370 --> 02:20:39,070
Let's grab that ice organ!

3944
02:20:40,170 --> 02:20:42,310
We need to expand our other business!

3945
02:20:42,430 --> 02:20:43,770
Our organ harvesting business!

3946
02:20:45,030 --> 02:20:46,410
Thank you for the super chat!

3947
02:20:46,510 --> 02:20:46,810
Thank you!

3948
02:20:46,830 --> 02:20:47,410
Thank you!

3949
02:20:47,410 --> 02:20:48,730
Doki doki!

3950
02:20:48,790 --> 02:20:50,410
Congrats on the skin suit debut!

3951
02:20:50,710 --> 02:20:51,470
It was amazing!

3952
02:20:52,270 --> 02:20:53,270
Today is my birthday!

3953
02:20:53,430 --> 02:20:57,330
And I was wondering if I could get a big happy birthday from the star of the show herself!

3954
02:20:57,690 --> 02:20:58,190
Thank you guys!

3955
02:20:58,270 --> 02:20:58,750
Of course!

3956
02:20:58,850 --> 02:20:59,570
Thank you for the super chat!

3957
02:20:59,670 --> 02:20:59,870
Thank you!

3958
02:20:59,970 --> 02:21:00,450
Thank you!

3959
02:21:00,490 --> 02:21:02,310
Happy birthday to you!

3960
02:21:02,650 --> 02:21:04,450
Happy birthday to you!

3961
02:21:04,710 --> 02:21:06,730
Happy birthday dear Zelle!

3962
02:21:07,030 --> 02:21:08,970
Happy birthday to you!

3963
02:21:09,130 --> 02:21:09,550
Yay!

3964
02:21:12,910 --> 02:21:13,410
Alright!

3965
02:21:13,570 --> 02:21:15,750
We need to grab a wolf!

3966
02:21:16,390 --> 02:21:19,050
So we can use it as a mount!

3967
02:21:19,250 --> 02:21:20,790
Because I'm tired of running!

3968
02:21:21,770 --> 02:21:23,230
Thank you for the super chat!

3969
02:21:23,390 --> 02:21:24,070
Thank you!

3970
02:21:24,270 --> 02:21:27,670
After lots of re-education, I've come to love my boss over in Lorde!

3971
02:21:27,670 --> 02:21:29,090
And now see the error of my ways!

3972
02:21:29,130 --> 02:21:30,030
That's good to know!

3973
02:21:30,750 --> 02:21:33,630
But we don't call it re-education here!

3974
02:21:33,810 --> 02:21:37,130
Because it's a choice if you want to go to Doki Berk University!

3975
02:21:38,230 --> 02:21:38,670
Okay?

3976
02:21:39,290 --> 02:21:40,070
It's a choice!

3977
02:21:40,350 --> 02:21:41,610
We put you in that room!

3978
02:21:41,750 --> 02:21:43,570
You can leave at any time in that room!

3979
02:21:44,050 --> 02:21:44,910
And you know?

3980
02:21:44,910 --> 02:21:45,710
It's not like...

3981
02:21:45,710 --> 02:21:46,410
Like...

3982
02:21:46,410 --> 02:21:50,230
It's not like you were chained to the desk so you couldn't get up and leave!

3983
02:21:50,570 --> 02:21:53,310
You can get up and leave at any time you want!

3984
02:21:56,530 --> 02:21:58,730
It's not like we were force feeding you!

3985
02:21:59,410 --> 02:22:00,450
Until you understood!

3986
02:22:03,650 --> 02:22:05,070
Ryr, thank you for the super chat!

3987
02:22:05,150 --> 02:22:05,450
Thank you!

3988
02:22:05,470 --> 02:22:05,990
Thank you!

3989
02:22:06,130 --> 02:22:07,690
So I got promoted last week!

3990
02:22:07,790 --> 02:22:10,010
Here's some of my paychecks so please don't promote me!

3991
02:22:11,130 --> 02:22:13,470
To Doki, thank you for the super chat!

3992
02:22:13,570 --> 02:22:13,890
Thank you!

3993
02:22:13,910 --> 02:22:14,550
Thank you!

3994
02:22:15,370 --> 02:22:19,010
Guys, don't you love working at Doki Berk Production Incorporated?

3995
02:22:19,750 --> 02:22:20,850
Don't you love it?

3996
02:22:20,890 --> 02:22:21,770
Love working here?

3997
02:22:23,850 --> 02:22:25,050
It's not a cult!

3998
02:22:25,130 --> 02:22:25,870
It's a business!

3999
02:22:26,230 --> 02:22:27,490
It's a family business!

4000
02:22:28,750 --> 02:22:32,350
With me and my... all my... all my orphans!

4001
02:22:39,590 --> 02:22:40,190
Yeah!

4002
02:22:40,650 --> 02:22:41,610
We love it here!

4003
02:22:42,030 --> 02:22:42,850
Can you climb?

4004
02:22:46,630 --> 02:22:47,350
Upgrade time!

4005
02:22:47,590 --> 02:22:48,070
Upgrade!

4006
02:22:48,150 --> 02:22:48,470
Upgrade!

4007
02:22:54,390 --> 02:22:56,690
Yes, we said it in unison!

4008
02:22:58,090 --> 02:22:59,890
I'm glad we understand!

4009
02:23:04,290 --> 02:23:06,510
I'm glad we all understand!

4010
02:23:09,390 --> 02:23:11,510
Oh my god, it's so... wait, I went the wrong way!

4011
02:23:11,650 --> 02:23:11,810
Oops!

4012
02:23:13,090 --> 02:23:14,070
Wait, what?

4013
02:23:15,090 --> 02:23:16,030
Is this new?

4014
02:23:16,270 --> 02:23:17,550
The way it did that?

4015
02:23:18,970 --> 02:23:20,850
Uhhh... I went the wrong way, guys.

4016
02:23:21,590 --> 02:23:23,450
I wanted to get that fast travel...

4017
02:23:23,450 --> 02:23:23,570
Ah!

4018
02:23:23,770 --> 02:23:24,670
Fuck you, I'm too lazy.

4019
02:23:25,090 --> 02:23:27,070
I'll get that fast travel another time.

4020
02:23:28,630 --> 02:23:31,690
I know like, the wolves are like here, right?

4021
02:23:33,070 --> 02:23:34,450
Wait, I should just...

4022
02:23:35,470 --> 02:23:37,090
I should just go to the other spawn.

4023
02:23:37,490 --> 02:23:37,930
Honestly.

4024
02:23:38,250 --> 02:23:40,330
Alright, let's find the closest...

4025
02:23:40,330 --> 02:23:43,170
Alright, the closest is like all the way over there.

4026
02:23:43,170 --> 02:23:43,770
Come on!

4027
02:23:43,790 --> 02:23:44,490
Come on, dragon!

4028
02:23:45,190 --> 02:23:45,790
Come on!

4029
02:23:46,970 --> 02:23:47,910
We need a...

4030
02:23:47,910 --> 02:23:49,030
We need a wolf!

4031
02:23:49,450 --> 02:23:52,170
By getting a wolf, we can get a...

4032
02:23:52,170 --> 02:23:53,910
We can get a flyer.

4033
02:23:53,970 --> 02:23:56,510
And by getting a flyer, we can go to the oil rig.

4034
02:23:56,930 --> 02:23:59,710
And after we get to the oil rig, we end the stream.

4035
02:24:02,430 --> 02:24:04,210
That's all I want.

4036
02:24:06,270 --> 02:24:08,250
Gordon, thank you for the super chat.

4037
02:24:08,390 --> 02:24:09,710
Thank you, thank you.

4038
02:24:10,510 --> 02:24:10,990
Um...

4039
02:24:10,990 --> 02:24:15,190
This all could have been avoided if you just gave us dental dungy.

4040
02:24:15,290 --> 02:24:16,470
Thank you for the super chat.

4041
02:24:16,570 --> 02:24:17,930
Thank you, thank you, Gordon.

4042
02:24:18,190 --> 02:24:22,090
All I'm saying is that if at any point...

4043
02:24:22,090 --> 02:24:26,070
If at any point you need dental, you'll get a promotion.

4044
02:24:27,070 --> 02:24:27,530
Uh...

4045
02:24:27,530 --> 02:24:28,270
A nut bacon!

4046
02:24:28,490 --> 02:24:29,790
Because that was a great idea.

4047
02:24:31,250 --> 02:24:32,710
Thank you for the magenta soup!

4048
02:24:32,870 --> 02:24:34,310
Thank you, thank you!

4049
02:24:34,430 --> 02:24:37,290
The bodies of my brothers litter the streets.

4050
02:24:37,870 --> 02:24:40,030
Dragoons don't stand for this tyranny.

4051
02:24:40,030 --> 02:24:41,650
Don't enter the...

4052
02:24:43,830 --> 02:24:46,130
Rise against the bourgeoisie.

4053
02:24:47,870 --> 02:24:49,290
Thank you for the magenta soup.

4054
02:24:49,530 --> 02:24:50,770
Thank you, thank you!

4055
02:24:52,610 --> 02:24:53,810
Let's see...

4056
02:24:54,790 --> 02:24:55,390
Guys!

4057
02:24:55,890 --> 02:24:57,810
Who else has some...

4058
02:24:57,810 --> 02:25:04,090
Who else also have some amazing ideas that they would like to share with the class?

4059
02:25:04,390 --> 02:25:05,250
With the company!

4060
02:25:05,410 --> 02:25:06,070
With the board!

4061
02:25:06,230 --> 02:25:07,210
With the board of director!

4062
02:25:08,570 --> 02:25:09,410
One director.

4063
02:25:11,330 --> 02:25:12,650
It's a shame that...

4064
02:25:13,630 --> 02:25:15,710
It's weird that we only have one director.

4065
02:25:16,170 --> 02:25:17,470
At the board of directors.

4066
02:25:20,370 --> 02:25:21,750
I sure don't!

4067
02:25:21,750 --> 02:25:22,530
I don't!

4068
02:25:22,530 --> 02:25:23,710
I have no ideas!

4069
02:25:24,170 --> 02:25:24,910
Oh, really?

4070
02:25:25,170 --> 02:25:25,630
Are you sure?

4071
02:25:25,830 --> 02:25:29,390
Not even one single idea that you want to entertain with the class?

4072
02:25:29,510 --> 02:25:30,170
With the company?

4073
02:25:38,540 --> 02:25:39,100
Not...

4074
02:25:39,100 --> 02:25:39,860
Are you guys sure?

4075
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:41,480
I'm always open for ideas!

4076
02:25:41,480 --> 02:25:41,760
I'm always open for ideas!

4077
02:25:41,760 --> 02:25:42,660
Dragoons!

4078
02:25:42,660 --> 02:25:44,540
If you want to improve the company...

4079
02:25:44,540 --> 02:25:48,760
All your brilliant and wonderful ideas that could possibly improve...

4080
02:25:50,760 --> 02:25:51,800
This company!

4081
02:25:55,620 --> 02:25:56,660
Let's see...

4082
02:25:57,240 --> 02:25:58,880
Guys, all I want is just...

4083
02:25:58,880 --> 02:26:00,120
I just want to get the oil.

4084
02:26:01,500 --> 02:26:03,720
I just want to get the oil, guys.

4085
02:26:03,940 --> 02:26:06,480
I want to be America for a day.

4086
02:26:06,900 --> 02:26:08,160
Alright, let's see...

4087
02:26:08,160 --> 02:26:09,120
There was like...

4088
02:26:09,120 --> 02:26:11,180
Wasn't there like a fucking family down there?

4089
02:26:12,980 --> 02:26:16,680
A family of wolves that I could kidnap?

4090
02:26:21,790 --> 02:26:22,670
Let's see...

4091
02:26:23,610 --> 02:26:25,210
Rob, thank you for the super chat.

4092
02:26:25,310 --> 02:26:26,070
Thank you, thank you.

4093
02:26:26,130 --> 02:26:27,230
They were over here, right?

4094
02:26:27,350 --> 02:26:29,830
I remember seeing a family of wolves...

4095
02:26:30,330 --> 02:26:32,190
Around like a bunch of eggs.

4096
02:26:36,270 --> 02:26:36,930
Just play!

4097
02:26:37,030 --> 02:26:37,930
Thank you for the super chat.

4098
02:26:38,030 --> 02:26:38,910
Thank you, thank you.

4099
02:26:40,050 --> 02:26:40,970
Where did they go?

4100
02:26:42,470 --> 02:26:43,630
The wolves disappeared.

4101
02:26:44,410 --> 02:26:46,790
There was a family of wolves down...

4102
02:26:46,790 --> 02:26:47,870
What the fuck?

4103
02:26:47,910 --> 02:26:48,570
They're gone!

4104
02:26:49,190 --> 02:26:50,850
You guys saw it?

4105
02:26:50,990 --> 02:26:52,270
We all saw it!

4106
02:26:53,210 --> 02:26:54,390
Where did they go?

4107
02:26:54,870 --> 02:26:57,450
I knew that was a fucking weird spawn!

4108
02:26:58,170 --> 02:26:59,550
I told you guys!

4109
02:26:59,630 --> 02:27:01,390
I was like, that's a fucking weird spawn!

4110
02:27:02,030 --> 02:27:04,250
I was like, I've never seen that before!

4111
02:27:04,750 --> 02:27:05,190
That...

4112
02:27:05,190 --> 02:27:06,550
The fucking...

4113
02:27:06,550 --> 02:27:10,470
The wolves spawning around a bunch of eggs?

4114
02:27:11,630 --> 02:27:12,470
Just play!

4115
02:27:12,470 --> 02:27:13,290
Thank you for the super chat.

4116
02:27:13,410 --> 02:27:13,650
Thank you.

4117
02:27:14,230 --> 02:27:15,550
Don't believe the propaganda.

4118
02:27:15,670 --> 02:27:16,610
It's a business.

4119
02:27:16,890 --> 02:27:18,210
We are a family.

4120
02:27:18,310 --> 02:27:19,570
Our boss is perfect.

4121
02:27:20,430 --> 02:27:22,170
And we are happy.

4122
02:27:22,310 --> 02:27:23,770
Just look at Dragoon Prime.

4123
02:27:24,430 --> 02:27:28,090
They grew three times their size instantly from pure love.

4124
02:27:28,630 --> 02:27:31,730
Because they joined the family business.

4125
02:27:32,030 --> 02:27:36,230
They were the first orphan to join the family business.

4126
02:27:36,510 --> 02:27:38,130
And now look at him!

4127
02:27:39,350 --> 02:27:40,510
Look at him!

4128
02:27:45,940 --> 02:27:49,080
Look at how big and strong he is now!

4129
02:27:51,460 --> 02:27:53,060
Kevin, thank you for the super chat.

4130
02:27:53,120 --> 02:27:53,360
Thank you.

4131
02:27:53,400 --> 02:27:53,880
Thank you.

4132
02:27:53,880 --> 02:27:56,080
Doki, my father died at your hand for the...

4133
02:27:56,080 --> 02:27:56,780
Wait, who?

4134
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:04,220
I don't know.

4135
02:28:04,720 --> 02:28:05,240
Father?

4136
02:28:05,440 --> 02:28:06,440
He never worked here.

4137
02:28:07,820 --> 02:28:09,880
I only recruit orphans.

4138
02:28:10,080 --> 02:28:11,260
I don't know.

4139
02:28:11,540 --> 02:28:13,180
I don't know what you're talking about.

4140
02:28:14,660 --> 02:28:15,520
Let's see.

4141
02:28:16,100 --> 02:28:17,820
Does anyone know where the wolves are?

4142
02:28:18,780 --> 02:28:20,740
I literally just need one wolf.

4143
02:28:21,640 --> 02:28:23,960
I remember seeing them here.

4144
02:28:24,940 --> 02:28:26,680
Where the fuck are the wolves?

4145
02:28:27,680 --> 02:28:28,860
How do they know?

4146
02:28:29,540 --> 02:28:30,860
How did they know?

4147
02:28:33,440 --> 02:28:34,640
Who snitched?

4148
02:28:35,340 --> 02:28:37,120
Who snitched in the company?

4149
02:28:37,600 --> 02:28:40,580
And told them I was looking for the wolves?

4150
02:28:41,400 --> 02:28:42,000
Hahaha!

4151
02:28:44,940 --> 02:28:49,440
Who gave the wolves intel before I could arrive?

4152
02:28:51,180 --> 02:28:52,040
Let's see.

4153
02:28:53,050 --> 02:28:57,420
They might think they can run away from Doki Bird Incorporated.

4154
02:28:58,300 --> 02:29:02,360
But you can never truly run away from a company that's expanding.

4155
02:29:03,760 --> 02:29:05,580
Company is always expanding.

4156
02:29:06,660 --> 02:29:07,360
Hahaha!

4157
02:29:09,580 --> 02:29:11,520
Lieutenant, thank you for the super chat.

4158
02:29:11,640 --> 02:29:11,920
Thank you.

4159
02:29:11,920 --> 02:29:12,480
Thank you.

4160
02:29:12,480 --> 02:29:12,980
Meow.

4161
02:29:12,980 --> 02:29:14,160
Thank you for the super chat.

4162
02:29:14,240 --> 02:29:14,480
Thank you.

4163
02:29:14,740 --> 02:29:15,020
Thank you.

4164
02:29:18,260 --> 02:29:19,520
They think...

4165
02:29:19,520 --> 02:29:20,920
They think they are safe.

4166
02:29:21,740 --> 02:29:24,000
But there's always one wolf.

4167
02:29:24,720 --> 02:29:29,060
There's always one pal that straggles behind the others.

4168
02:29:29,700 --> 02:29:30,500
Hahaha!

4169
02:29:32,200 --> 02:29:33,000
Hahaha!

4170
02:29:33,780 --> 02:29:37,800
All I need is one wolf.

4171
02:29:38,260 --> 02:29:39,320
Oh hey, an egg.

4172
02:29:39,720 --> 02:29:40,520
Nice.

4173
02:29:40,520 --> 02:29:42,620
Are you hungry?

4174
02:29:42,820 --> 02:29:43,840
Dragoon Prime?

4175
02:29:44,020 --> 02:29:45,160
Are you hungry?

4176
02:29:45,780 --> 02:29:47,260
Here you go.

4177
02:29:47,540 --> 02:29:48,380
Hahaha!

4178
02:29:51,840 --> 02:29:53,520
Don't you love eggs?

4179
02:29:53,940 --> 02:29:55,220
They're so delicious.

4180
02:29:58,740 --> 02:30:00,720
Oh, these elephants.

4181
02:30:02,140 --> 02:30:03,260
They know.

4182
02:30:04,420 --> 02:30:05,800
I hate them.

4183
02:30:06,020 --> 02:30:07,880
Go Dragoon Prime.

4184
02:30:08,140 --> 02:30:08,840
Go!

4185
02:30:09,400 --> 02:30:09,820
Alright.

4186
02:30:09,820 --> 02:30:10,300
Alright.

4187
02:30:11,520 --> 02:30:13,560
There's always one straggler.

4188
02:30:14,700 --> 02:30:15,460
Hahaha!

4189
02:30:19,320 --> 02:30:21,980
There's always one straggler.

4190
02:30:22,860 --> 02:30:25,780
They think that wolf thinks he's...

4191
02:30:25,780 --> 02:30:29,020
The wolves think they're being smart right now?

4192
02:30:30,980 --> 02:30:32,340
They think...

4193
02:30:32,340 --> 02:30:34,740
They think they're being so cheeky.

4194
02:30:35,940 --> 02:30:37,620
But I know...

4195
02:30:37,620 --> 02:30:39,780
I know there's always one.

4196
02:30:40,800 --> 02:30:42,200
I'm not afraid.

4197
02:30:43,340 --> 02:30:45,440
All you need is one wolf.

4198
02:30:46,120 --> 02:30:48,180
Alright, let's look at the pal deck.

4199
02:30:49,240 --> 02:30:49,920
Wolves.

4200
02:30:50,480 --> 02:30:51,500
Dire wolves.

4201
02:30:51,620 --> 02:30:52,260
Habitau.

4202
02:30:53,080 --> 02:30:53,760
How...

4203
02:30:53,760 --> 02:30:55,920
How is this like prime...

4204
02:30:55,920 --> 02:30:57,220
Hahaha!

4205
02:30:58,480 --> 02:30:59,160
Hahaha!

4206
02:30:59,160 --> 02:30:59,360
Hahaha!

4207
02:31:00,640 --> 02:31:04,180
This is literally prime wolf territory!

4208
02:31:04,180 --> 02:31:05,240
Hahaha!

4209
02:31:07,160 --> 02:31:07,580
Hahaha!

4210
02:31:09,140 --> 02:31:10,760
What the fuck?

4211
02:31:11,180 --> 02:31:13,820
How is this prime wolf territory?

4212
02:31:14,620 --> 02:31:17,500
Where did all these fucking wolves go?

4213
02:31:18,640 --> 02:31:19,480
They...

4214
02:31:19,480 --> 02:31:20,800
They know!

4215
02:31:21,140 --> 02:31:21,760
I don't need...

4216
02:31:24,760 --> 02:31:25,280
Wolves!

4217
02:31:25,660 --> 02:31:25,940
Hahaha!

4218
02:31:26,700 --> 02:31:29,120
They are actually hiding.

4219
02:31:29,220 --> 02:31:30,480
That's actually crazy.

4220
02:31:31,040 --> 02:31:33,140
Oh my god.

4221
02:31:33,880 --> 02:31:36,160
Why are they afraid of me?

4222
02:31:36,360 --> 02:31:37,160
So...

4223
02:31:37,160 --> 02:31:38,260
This is my next bounty.

4224
02:31:39,100 --> 02:31:39,780
Hahaha!

4225
02:31:42,400 --> 02:31:44,860
How can they be so scared?

4226
02:31:46,720 --> 02:31:48,680
Does the company provide dental?

4227
02:31:50,040 --> 02:31:51,400
That's a good question.

4228
02:31:51,680 --> 02:31:53,800
Why don't you join the company and find out?

4229
02:31:55,060 --> 02:31:55,740
Uh.

4230
02:31:56,100 --> 02:31:56,580
Alright.

4231
02:31:57,180 --> 02:31:58,920
I can't believe it.

4232
02:31:59,120 --> 02:32:00,320
This is literally...

4233
02:32:00,320 --> 02:32:01,300
This is where they live.

4234
02:32:01,500 --> 02:32:03,620
This is literally where they live.

4235
02:32:04,640 --> 02:32:05,320
Haha!

4236
02:32:05,540 --> 02:32:07,140
I only have one wolf!

4237
02:32:07,140 --> 02:32:08,200
We have one target here.

4238
02:32:09,440 --> 02:32:11,140
Just one.

4239
02:32:12,780 --> 02:32:15,540
We saw so many wolves earlier.

4240
02:32:16,220 --> 02:32:17,900
That's the worst part.

4241
02:32:18,600 --> 02:32:21,520
We saw like a million of them.

4242
02:32:23,260 --> 02:32:23,920
Let's see.

4243
02:32:37,240 --> 02:32:39,420
Payday for bad workers is cancelled.

4244
02:32:40,740 --> 02:32:42,600
Thank you for the super chat Cypher.

4245
02:32:42,700 --> 02:32:43,080
Thank you.

4246
02:32:43,080 --> 02:32:43,580
Thank you.

4247
02:32:43,620 --> 02:32:46,600
I don't know why they are avoiding me.

4248
02:32:47,120 --> 02:32:49,720
I just want one or... Oh there you are.

4249
02:32:49,760 --> 02:32:50,460
I see you.

4250
02:32:50,640 --> 02:32:52,120
I see you.

4251
02:32:52,840 --> 02:32:55,940
All it takes is one wolf.

4252
02:33:01,700 --> 02:33:03,920
I see you.

4253
02:33:03,920 --> 02:33:09,960
The last remaining wolf out there.

4254
02:33:12,700 --> 02:33:15,000
I see you.

4255
02:33:20,720 --> 02:33:22,560
Come on.

4256
02:33:25,740 --> 02:33:27,040
Found an orphan.

4257
02:33:27,680 --> 02:33:29,080
Guys I did it.

4258
02:33:29,120 --> 02:33:30,240
I found a fucking orphan.

4259
02:33:34,160 --> 02:33:35,240
We did it guys.

4260
02:33:36,100 --> 02:33:36,880
Orphan caught.

4261
02:33:38,600 --> 02:33:40,000
Where is his family?

4262
02:33:40,060 --> 02:33:43,500
He literally was the last remaining wolf out there.

4263
02:33:44,240 --> 02:33:45,700
Gary thank you for the super chat.

4264
02:33:45,820 --> 02:33:46,120
Thank you.

4265
02:33:46,140 --> 02:33:46,580
Thank you.

4266
02:33:46,600 --> 02:33:48,100
Guys we just need to face the truth.

4267
02:33:48,360 --> 02:33:49,260
This is a... Oh.

4268
02:33:49,940 --> 02:33:50,800
Is it a what?

4269
02:33:51,020 --> 02:33:51,420
Sorry.

4270
02:33:51,640 --> 02:33:54,840
His connection cut off before I could read the rest of his message.

4271
02:33:55,320 --> 02:33:56,440
Thank you for the super chat.

4272
02:33:56,540 --> 02:33:56,820
Thank you.

4273
02:33:56,840 --> 02:33:57,440
Thank you.

4274
02:34:00,420 --> 02:34:01,740
Sheena thank you for the super chat.

4275
02:34:01,800 --> 02:34:02,040
Thank you.

4276
02:34:02,060 --> 02:34:02,520
Thank you.

4277
02:34:02,520 --> 02:34:06,420
Budabest Arc Orchestra made a Twitter for getting a Dragoon theme music.

4278
02:34:06,460 --> 02:34:07,440
We just hit 20k.

4279
02:34:07,700 --> 02:34:07,980
Wow.

4280
02:34:09,060 --> 02:34:11,180
You guys can get your own song.

4281
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:12,860
Thank you for the super chat.

4282
02:34:13,020 --> 02:34:13,320
Thank you.

4283
02:34:13,340 --> 02:34:14,000
Thank you.

4284
02:34:14,160 --> 02:34:18,360
I was going to talk more about the orchestra shit during the behind the scenes guys.

4285
02:34:22,100 --> 02:34:22,640
Don't worry.

4286
02:34:22,700 --> 02:34:24,120
I'll talk more about the orchestra.

4287
02:34:24,660 --> 02:34:30,080
I hired in the behind the scenes stream on Saturday.

4288
02:34:30,760 --> 02:34:32,220
Coyote thank you for the super chat.

4289
02:34:32,320 --> 02:34:32,560
Thank you.

4290
02:34:32,580 --> 02:34:33,120
Thank you.

4291
02:34:33,240 --> 02:34:39,080
We finally have one coyote to work for us in Doki Bird Incorporated.

4292
02:34:39,580 --> 02:34:41,340
We finally got him.

4293
02:34:43,760 --> 02:34:45,040
He thought...

4294
02:34:46,740 --> 02:34:49,540
He thought he was being so...

4295
02:34:49,540 --> 02:34:50,420
We found it.

4296
02:34:50,460 --> 02:34:50,980
The straggler.

4297
02:34:50,980 --> 02:34:51,740
I told you guys.

4298
02:34:52,660 --> 02:34:55,440
There is always one straggler.

4299
02:34:55,760 --> 02:35:00,060
Despite all the other wolves running away and hiding.

4300
02:35:00,080 --> 02:35:05,340
There is always going to be one wolf that did not get the message.

4301
02:35:10,980 --> 02:35:19,060
There is always one wolf that didn't get the message from all the other wolves.

4302
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,860
And now he works for me now.

4303
02:35:24,520 --> 02:35:26,620
Thank god he was an orphan too.

4304
02:35:26,920 --> 02:35:29,660
So I don't have to do extra work for...

4305
02:35:29,660 --> 02:35:31,920
So I don't have to make him an orphan.

4306
02:35:32,880 --> 02:35:33,920
That's the best part.

4307
02:35:34,300 --> 02:35:35,540
That's the best part chat.

4308
02:35:36,380 --> 02:35:37,260
Isn't it great?

4309
02:35:39,600 --> 02:35:40,140
Alright.

4310
02:35:43,680 --> 02:35:45,020
Off we go.

4311
02:35:45,340 --> 02:35:47,500
Off we go back home Dragoon Prime.

4312
02:35:48,060 --> 02:35:49,240
We are going home.

4313
02:35:50,380 --> 02:35:51,260
We are going home.

4314
02:35:51,320 --> 02:35:51,900
We are getting...

4315
02:35:51,900 --> 02:35:53,300
We are getting a mount.

4316
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:55,680
A dire wolf mount.

4317
02:35:55,940 --> 02:35:56,820
And then...

4318
02:35:56,820 --> 02:35:59,460
And then we are going to kidnap a flying guy.

4319
02:36:00,740 --> 02:36:03,740
And after we kidnap the flying guy.

4320
02:36:03,880 --> 02:36:05,420
We go to the oil rig.

4321
02:36:06,740 --> 02:36:09,180
Off to adventures we go Dragoon.

4322
02:36:09,960 --> 02:36:12,820
Man remember when I first caught you Dragoon?

4323
02:36:13,060 --> 02:36:15,160
And like when I first spawned here.

4324
02:36:15,460 --> 02:36:18,220
And you were the very first pal I ever caught.

4325
02:36:18,980 --> 02:36:20,520
Those were good times.

4326
02:36:21,140 --> 02:36:21,800
Oh hey.

4327
02:36:22,620 --> 02:36:23,660
There is the other.

4328
02:36:23,760 --> 02:36:25,260
Wait there is another wolf?

4329
02:36:26,820 --> 02:36:28,680
There was no other wolf.

4330
02:36:34,600 --> 02:36:37,200
Don't worry Dragoon Prime is coming.

4331
02:36:37,580 --> 02:36:40,180
There was never another wolf.

4332
02:36:40,520 --> 02:36:44,160
We only found one wolf guys.

4333
02:36:46,640 --> 02:36:49,860
We only found one.

4334
02:36:54,700 --> 02:36:55,800
There we go.

4335
02:36:55,800 --> 02:36:59,260
I made sure to get the job done.

4336
02:36:59,420 --> 02:37:00,940
Finish the job myself.

4337
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,300
Mirchel thank you for the five gift of shits.

4338
02:37:04,420 --> 02:37:04,680
Thank you.

4339
02:37:06,680 --> 02:37:07,420
Let's see.

4340
02:37:08,120 --> 02:37:10,720
I mean you get caught first and you are the lucky one.

4341
02:37:11,420 --> 02:37:12,080
Isn't it?

4342
02:37:13,200 --> 02:37:15,480
Does that mean you are lucky if you get caught first?

4343
02:37:17,560 --> 02:37:18,040
Alright.

4344
02:37:18,360 --> 02:37:19,140
Let's head home.

4345
02:37:19,280 --> 02:37:21,260
There is only one teleporter here apparently.

4346
02:37:25,360 --> 02:37:25,840
Hmm.

4347
02:37:25,840 --> 02:37:26,660
Alright.

4348
02:37:26,960 --> 02:37:27,520
Let's go.

4349
02:37:29,460 --> 02:37:30,520
Let's head over.

4350
02:37:32,600 --> 02:37:33,920
Let's head home.

4351
02:37:34,920 --> 02:37:37,040
And then after we head home.

4352
02:37:37,960 --> 02:37:38,480
We...

4353
02:37:41,040 --> 02:37:41,560
We...

4354
02:37:41,560 --> 02:37:44,120
Gotta find the...

4355
02:37:44,120 --> 02:37:44,720
What were they called?

4356
02:37:44,860 --> 02:37:45,760
They are like those mini dragons.

4357
02:37:46,120 --> 02:37:46,800
I think I can...

4358
02:37:46,800 --> 02:37:48,960
I think I have enough materials too for them.

4359
02:37:49,360 --> 02:37:51,680
There can only be one.

4360
02:37:52,200 --> 02:37:52,960
What other wolves?

4361
02:37:53,160 --> 02:37:54,260
I see no other wolves.

4362
02:37:54,400 --> 02:37:54,860
Exactly.

4363
02:37:54,860 --> 02:37:57,140
There has never been other wolves.

4364
02:37:58,040 --> 02:37:59,600
What are you guys talking about?

4365
02:38:00,920 --> 02:38:01,640
This way.

4366
02:38:02,300 --> 02:38:03,120
Oh my gosh.

4367
02:38:03,380 --> 02:38:05,260
And then by the time I get home.

4368
02:38:05,360 --> 02:38:08,700
I can craft a saddle for the wolf.

4369
02:38:08,880 --> 02:38:10,080
And then when I get the saddle.

4370
02:38:10,200 --> 02:38:12,480
I don't have to run like a fucking peasant.

4371
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:18,760
Then I can be carried.

4372
02:38:20,240 --> 02:38:22,200
Like the CEO I am.

4373
02:38:22,380 --> 02:38:23,920
Of Doki Bird Productions.

4374
02:38:24,680 --> 02:38:25,160
Incorporated.

4375
02:38:27,960 --> 02:38:29,880
A bounty hunter is like a hitman.

4376
02:38:31,040 --> 02:38:31,520
Except...

4377
02:38:31,520 --> 02:38:33,840
You are given a choice to leave them alive.

4378
02:38:35,240 --> 02:38:36,200
Like sometimes...

4379
02:38:36,200 --> 02:38:39,740
99% of my choices is not leaving them alive.

4380
02:38:40,220 --> 02:38:41,680
But there is the 1% chance.

4381
02:38:42,160 --> 02:38:44,560
There is the 1% chance that you get to live.

4382
02:38:44,820 --> 02:38:46,300
So that is why I am not a hitman.

4383
02:38:48,620 --> 02:38:50,140
It should be like around here.

4384
02:38:51,080 --> 02:38:52,340
Where the fuck is it?

4385
02:38:53,360 --> 02:38:54,520
Like here somewhere.

4386
02:38:56,440 --> 02:38:56,920
Okay.

4387
02:38:58,680 --> 02:38:59,920
What the fuck?

4388
02:38:59,960 --> 02:39:00,840
I don't want you to climb.

4389
02:39:01,920 --> 02:39:02,400
Okay.

4390
02:39:02,440 --> 02:39:03,000
This way.

4391
02:39:03,760 --> 02:39:05,020
I don't like the odds.

4392
02:39:05,340 --> 02:39:06,020
It's like gotcha.

4393
02:39:06,320 --> 02:39:07,960
You guys are willing to gotcha.

4394
02:39:08,020 --> 02:39:11,140
Waifus with a 0.1% chance of hitting your gotcha.

4395
02:39:11,260 --> 02:39:11,840
But oh.

4396
02:39:12,360 --> 02:39:14,000
Apparently when it's life or death.

4397
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:18,740
That's where you draw the line.

4398
02:39:19,160 --> 02:39:19,360
Wait.

4399
02:39:19,420 --> 02:39:20,180
I can ride this bird.

4400
02:39:21,160 --> 02:39:21,640
Wait.

4401
02:39:21,640 --> 02:39:22,040
Fuck that.

4402
02:39:22,140 --> 02:39:22,320
I can't.

4403
02:39:22,320 --> 02:39:22,800
Me.

4404
02:39:24,140 --> 02:39:24,560
Wait.

4405
02:39:24,620 --> 02:39:25,140
I can't.

4406
02:39:25,160 --> 02:39:25,540
Fuck.

4407
02:39:25,800 --> 02:39:27,220
I don't have a bow and arrow.

4408
02:39:27,300 --> 02:39:27,500
No!

4409
02:39:29,580 --> 02:39:30,000
No!

4410
02:39:30,640 --> 02:39:33,070
I'm this bird.

4411
02:39:35,150 --> 02:39:36,970
I didn't make a bow and arrow.

4412
02:39:39,650 --> 02:39:40,690
God damn it.

4413
02:39:42,730 --> 02:39:43,850
God damn it.

4414
02:39:44,990 --> 02:39:46,410
I forgot to get a bow.

4415
02:39:46,470 --> 02:39:47,990
I forgot to craft a bow and arrow.

4416
02:39:48,090 --> 02:39:49,270
I knew I forgot to craft something.

4417
02:39:49,610 --> 02:39:49,930
Wait.

4418
02:39:49,950 --> 02:39:50,530
Do I actually not?

4419
02:39:52,050 --> 02:39:52,470
No!

4420
02:39:52,470 --> 02:39:55,790
I could have just got that and be happy.

4421
02:39:57,110 --> 02:39:57,770
Just throw a...

4422
02:39:57,770 --> 02:39:58,210
Oh you're right.

4423
02:39:58,250 --> 02:39:58,810
Just throw a bird.

4424
02:39:58,950 --> 02:39:59,410
I just saw...

4425
02:39:59,410 --> 02:40:00,150
Throw a ball at it.

4426
02:40:00,170 --> 02:40:00,510
You're right.

4427
02:40:00,650 --> 02:40:01,490
I'm so stupid.

4428
02:40:02,070 --> 02:40:04,130
Yeah but I have like a regular pow.

4429
02:40:04,210 --> 02:40:04,370
Wait.

4430
02:40:04,390 --> 02:40:04,810
Where did it go?

4431
02:40:05,630 --> 02:40:05,990
No!

4432
02:40:06,090 --> 02:40:07,910
And then it despawned?

4433
02:40:09,570 --> 02:40:09,930
What?

4434
02:40:12,910 --> 02:40:14,290
Did it despawn?

4435
02:40:17,250 --> 02:40:17,970
That fast?

4436
02:40:18,650 --> 02:40:19,010
What?

4437
02:40:19,110 --> 02:40:20,930
I literally looked away for one second.

4438
02:40:21,610 --> 02:40:21,970
I'm so stupid.

4439
02:40:21,970 --> 02:40:22,010
I'm so stupid.

4440
02:40:22,010 --> 02:40:25,650
I actually looked away for one second and then...

4441
02:40:25,650 --> 02:40:25,790
Wait.

4442
02:40:25,930 --> 02:40:26,650
Meteorite descent?

4443
02:40:26,770 --> 02:40:27,090
Wait.

4444
02:40:27,130 --> 02:40:27,410
What?

4445
02:40:28,330 --> 02:40:28,770
Where?

4446
02:40:30,410 --> 02:40:31,070
On me?

4447
02:40:33,630 --> 02:40:34,070
Oh.

4448
02:40:35,290 --> 02:40:37,150
What the fuck is that the other area?

4449
02:40:39,500 --> 02:40:39,940
Okay.

4450
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:40,540
We gotta go there.

4451
02:40:40,700 --> 02:40:40,980
Wait.

4452
02:40:41,040 --> 02:40:41,820
That's actually pretty cool.

4453
02:40:41,880 --> 02:40:42,420
We gotta go there.

4454
02:40:42,940 --> 02:40:43,380
Alright.

4455
02:40:44,320 --> 02:40:44,760
Alright.

4456
02:40:44,860 --> 02:40:46,120
It was like over there.

4457
02:40:46,180 --> 02:40:46,640
Alright chicken.

4458
02:40:46,780 --> 02:40:47,380
We're gonna go.

4459
02:40:47,920 --> 02:40:48,360
Okay.

4460
02:40:48,380 --> 02:40:49,020
We can't die.

4461
02:40:49,240 --> 02:40:50,220
We're like level 15.

4462
02:40:50,220 --> 02:40:51,220
We have like...

4463
02:40:51,220 --> 02:40:51,680
Wait.

4464
02:40:51,700 --> 02:40:53,160
I wanna see what the meteorite is.

4465
02:40:54,300 --> 02:40:54,880
Wait.

4466
02:40:54,920 --> 02:40:55,220
What?

4467
02:40:57,540 --> 02:40:58,900
There's a meteorite.

4468
02:41:01,640 --> 02:41:02,760
I wanna see.

4469
02:41:02,820 --> 02:41:03,680
I'm interested now.

4470
02:41:04,020 --> 02:41:04,780
Oh my god.

4471
02:41:06,080 --> 02:41:06,800
It's swim.

4472
02:41:07,480 --> 02:41:09,140
Fly away now.

4473
02:41:09,400 --> 02:41:10,520
Fly away.

4474
02:41:11,060 --> 02:41:12,260
Fly away.

4475
02:41:13,320 --> 02:41:13,520
Look.

4476
02:41:13,580 --> 02:41:14,480
We have the stamina now.

4477
02:41:16,220 --> 02:41:17,380
What the fuck?

4478
02:41:18,740 --> 02:41:19,780
Send it, kid.

4479
02:41:19,820 --> 02:41:20,200
Clear.

4480
02:41:21,040 --> 02:41:22,080
Oh my god.

4481
02:41:22,120 --> 02:41:23,340
We can knock over there.

4482
02:41:25,860 --> 02:41:27,420
Oh my god.

4483
02:41:27,500 --> 02:41:29,260
This area is dangerous.

4484
02:41:30,880 --> 02:41:32,400
What's going on over there?

4485
02:41:32,980 --> 02:41:34,680
What the fuck?

4486
02:41:36,160 --> 02:41:38,200
What the fuck is going...

4487
02:41:38,200 --> 02:41:39,500
What is that?

4488
02:41:42,440 --> 02:41:43,660
Oh my god.

4489
02:41:43,720 --> 02:41:45,340
Let's go to the meteorite.

4490
02:41:45,880 --> 02:41:46,480
Hey.

4491
02:41:46,540 --> 02:41:47,360
There's a blue one.

4492
02:41:48,420 --> 02:41:49,020
Wait.

4493
02:41:49,020 --> 02:41:50,160
Where did the meteorite land?

4494
02:41:51,440 --> 02:41:52,580
I don't even know.

4495
02:41:53,820 --> 02:41:56,200
I don't even know where the meteorite landed, chat.

4496
02:41:56,560 --> 02:41:57,200
Oh my god.

4497
02:41:57,300 --> 02:41:58,020
I don't even...

4498
02:41:59,960 --> 02:42:02,200
Where the fuck did the meteorite land?

4499
02:42:04,100 --> 02:42:05,020
That was it?

4500
02:42:05,100 --> 02:42:06,120
That was the meteor?

4501
02:42:10,440 --> 02:42:10,880
Oh.

4502
02:42:15,180 --> 02:42:16,120
He's the meteor?

4503
02:42:17,840 --> 02:42:18,600
Oh my god.

4504
02:42:18,620 --> 02:42:18,960
It is.

4505
02:42:22,220 --> 02:42:22,660
Wait.

4506
02:42:22,740 --> 02:42:23,540
We have a chance.

4507
02:42:23,540 --> 02:42:23,660
We have a chance.

4508
02:42:23,680 --> 02:42:26,240
The syndicate is stuck in the wall and she can't kill it.

4509
02:42:31,770 --> 02:42:32,850
He sees me.

4510
02:42:33,030 --> 02:42:33,510
Oh.

4511
02:42:33,650 --> 02:42:33,890
Oh.

4512
02:42:34,010 --> 02:42:34,210
Oh.

4513
02:42:42,550 --> 02:42:43,030
Noink.

4514
02:42:43,030 --> 02:42:43,490
Noink.

4515
02:42:43,550 --> 02:42:43,870
Noink.

4516
02:42:47,960 --> 02:42:48,440
Oh.

4517
02:42:51,220 --> 02:42:52,160
My purple ball.

4518
02:42:54,320 --> 02:42:54,900
Oh yeah.

4519
02:42:57,380 --> 02:42:58,340
1.2.

4520
02:42:58,380 --> 02:42:58,860
Oh.

4521
02:42:58,900 --> 02:42:59,140
Seven.

4522
02:42:59,240 --> 02:42:59,520
Okay.

4523
02:42:59,860 --> 02:43:00,340
Okay.

4524
02:43:01,400 --> 02:43:01,880
My.

4525
02:43:02,340 --> 02:43:02,820
No.

4526
02:43:03,780 --> 02:43:04,260
No.

4527
02:43:04,420 --> 02:43:04,900
No.

4528
02:43:04,960 --> 02:43:05,440
No.

4529
02:43:05,440 --> 02:43:05,620
Okay.

4530
02:43:05,980 --> 02:43:06,940
I have one more.

4531
02:43:08,400 --> 02:43:09,280
Oh god.

4532
02:43:09,480 --> 02:43:10,240
Oh god.

4533
02:43:10,420 --> 02:43:11,940
Oh god.

4534
02:43:13,360 --> 02:43:13,840
Okay.

4535
02:43:13,980 --> 02:43:14,660
This is it.

4536
02:43:16,260 --> 02:43:16,740
No!

4537
02:43:21,440 --> 02:43:22,400
Zero percent!

4538
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:24,160
Oh my mega sphere.

4539
02:43:24,400 --> 02:43:25,360
My mega sphere.

4540
02:43:25,840 --> 02:43:26,320
No!

4541
02:43:27,520 --> 02:43:31,320
We had three chances.

4542
02:43:32,940 --> 02:43:33,900
Oh no.

4543
02:43:34,220 --> 02:43:35,360
I need to use the bathroom, guys.

4544
02:43:35,440 --> 02:43:38,100
We're going to look out into the water with...

4545
02:43:38,100 --> 02:43:38,940
I'll be right back.

4546
02:43:38,960 --> 02:43:39,120
I just need to...

4547
02:43:39,120 --> 02:43:39,880
I need to use the bathroom.

4548
02:43:41,320 --> 02:43:42,120
Us and...

4549
02:43:42,120 --> 02:43:44,260
Us and Dragoon Prime can look at each other.

4550
02:43:44,420 --> 02:43:44,580
Wait.

4551
02:43:44,600 --> 02:43:45,000
Where are you going?

4552
02:43:45,440 --> 02:43:46,660
You are not fighting.

4553
02:43:46,820 --> 02:43:48,220
You are not fighting her.

4554
02:43:48,420 --> 02:43:49,920
You are not fighting her.

4555
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:50,940
We're just gonna...

4556
02:43:50,940 --> 02:43:52,220
Is she coming over?

4557
02:43:52,520 --> 02:43:52,920
No.

4558
02:43:52,980 --> 02:43:54,960
We're just going to look out into the ocean, guys.

4559
02:43:55,120 --> 02:43:55,640
I'll be right back.

4560
02:43:55,800 --> 02:43:56,280
I'll be right back.

4561
02:47:04,190 --> 02:47:05,030
All right, Dad.

4562
02:47:05,150 --> 02:47:05,690
Get off.

4563
02:47:05,890 --> 02:47:06,370
All right.

4564
02:47:07,110 --> 02:47:07,890
All right, guys.

4565
02:47:09,330 --> 02:47:09,730
What...

4566
02:47:09,730 --> 02:47:10,550
What are you guys...

4567
02:47:10,550 --> 02:47:11,830
What are you guys talking about here?

4568
02:47:13,370 --> 02:47:13,770
I'm sorry.

4569
02:47:13,770 --> 02:47:14,070
I'm sorry.

4570
02:47:14,770 --> 02:47:15,170
I'm sorry.

4571
02:47:15,190 --> 02:47:15,490
Come on.

4572
02:47:15,490 --> 02:47:16,070
Tell me the reason why.

4573
02:47:16,110 --> 02:47:16,430
Tell me your leader.

4574
02:47:16,430 --> 02:47:16,950
Who's your leader?

4575
02:47:22,970 --> 02:47:24,210
Who's your leader?

4576
02:47:24,510 --> 02:47:25,510
Come on.

4577
02:47:26,010 --> 02:47:30,590
I just want to talk.

4578
02:47:32,530 --> 02:47:33,130
I just...

4579
02:47:37,770 --> 02:47:46,910
I just want to talk and Thank you, thank you!

4580
02:47:46,930 --> 02:47:47,450
Dragons!

4581
02:47:47,870 --> 02:47:49,470
Her soul has left their body!

4582
02:47:49,570 --> 02:47:50,690
Now it's the time!

4583
02:47:50,810 --> 02:47:51,610
Oh, Liam!

4584
02:47:52,230 --> 02:47:53,490
You're the leader!

4585
02:47:54,010 --> 02:47:55,070
Why don't you...

4586
02:47:55,070 --> 02:47:57,530
Liam, why don't you come with me to the boardroom?

4587
02:47:57,730 --> 02:47:59,690
And we can have a little talk.

4588
02:48:01,850 --> 02:48:03,410
Liam, thank you with the Akasupa!

4589
02:48:03,810 --> 02:48:04,890
Thank you, thank you!

4590
02:48:05,290 --> 02:48:06,750
Bring your credit card too.

4591
02:48:07,410 --> 02:48:08,590
Alright, let's see...

4592
02:48:09,650 --> 02:48:11,190
Let's go over there...

4593
02:48:15,530 --> 02:48:17,070
Let's go over here...

4594
02:48:17,070 --> 02:48:18,470
And we need...

4595
02:48:18,470 --> 02:48:20,450
We literally just need...

4596
02:48:20,450 --> 02:48:22,810
to craft a mount!

4597
02:48:23,190 --> 02:48:25,210
And when we craft the mount...

4598
02:48:25,210 --> 02:48:26,370
We can get...

4599
02:48:26,370 --> 02:48:27,930
We can ride the wolf!

4600
02:48:28,070 --> 02:48:30,870
We can catch a flyer!

4601
02:48:30,870 --> 02:48:32,610
And when we catch the flyer...

4602
02:48:33,850 --> 02:48:36,150
When we catch the flyer...

4603
02:48:36,150 --> 02:48:37,190
We can finally...

4604
02:48:37,910 --> 02:48:40,790
We can finally go to the oil rig!

4605
02:48:41,050 --> 02:48:41,430
We can finally go to the oil rig!

4606
02:48:41,430 --> 02:48:42,750
That's all I want!

4607
02:48:42,810 --> 02:48:45,170
I just want to go to the oil rig!

4608
02:48:47,770 --> 02:48:48,330
Alright...

4609
02:48:48,330 --> 02:48:49,990
We need to craft a bow...

4610
02:48:49,990 --> 02:48:50,910
We do though...

4611
02:48:50,910 --> 02:48:52,150
So we can like...

4612
02:48:52,150 --> 02:48:54,150
Get them to come down...

4613
02:48:54,150 --> 02:48:55,570
So... let's see...

4614
02:48:55,570 --> 02:48:57,490
I have not fucking...

4615
02:48:57,490 --> 02:49:00,290
I did not do technology for the bow...

4616
02:49:00,290 --> 02:49:02,190
I don't even have armor...

4617
02:49:02,190 --> 02:49:04,170
I know what I want...

4618
02:49:06,710 --> 02:49:09,530
I don't even have armor...

4619
02:49:09,530 --> 02:49:11,230
Okay, we'll grab an old bow...

4620
02:49:11,810 --> 02:49:13,370
I don't think I need...

4621
02:49:13,370 --> 02:49:15,170
Honestly, I don't need like...

4622
02:49:15,190 --> 02:49:16,170
A better bow...

4623
02:49:19,750 --> 02:49:21,150
Let's see...

4624
02:49:21,150 --> 02:49:22,450
Oh, by the way guys...

4625
02:49:22,450 --> 02:49:26,130
We have a complaint box right now...

4626
02:49:26,130 --> 02:49:26,810
So like...

4627
02:49:26,810 --> 02:49:29,870
If you want to complain about anything...

4628
02:49:29,870 --> 02:49:31,190
Feel free...

4629
02:49:31,710 --> 02:49:32,950
Feel free to...

4630
02:49:32,950 --> 02:49:34,490
Put that super...

4631
02:49:40,270 --> 02:49:43,470
It's in the super chat box...

4632
02:49:45,730 --> 02:49:49,550
And we are actually starting a new policy...

4633
02:49:49,550 --> 02:49:50,730
It's called...

4634
02:49:50,730 --> 02:49:53,630
Snitches don't get stitches...

4635
02:49:53,630 --> 02:49:54,710
So...

4636
02:49:54,710 --> 02:49:56,310
If you see any...

4637
02:49:56,310 --> 02:49:58,310
Fellow dragoons...

4638
02:49:58,310 --> 02:50:00,270
Doing something that you believe...

4639
02:50:00,270 --> 02:50:02,390
Is against company policy...

4640
02:50:02,390 --> 02:50:04,290
You can drop your...

4641
02:50:04,290 --> 02:50:06,150
You can drop your note...

4642
02:50:06,150 --> 02:50:07,550
At the snitches...

4643
02:50:07,550 --> 02:50:09,990
Don't get stitches boxes...

4644
02:50:09,990 --> 02:50:12,150
Name anybody you want...

4645
02:50:12,150 --> 02:50:13,010
Anonymously...

4646
02:50:13,010 --> 02:50:13,450
So don't get stitches...

4647
02:50:13,470 --> 02:50:14,250
Do not worry...

4648
02:50:15,300 --> 02:50:16,190
Let's see...

4649
02:50:16,190 --> 02:50:17,070
I need...

4650
02:50:17,070 --> 02:50:20,430
I need to make like that...

4651
02:50:20,430 --> 02:50:21,330
Umm...

4652
02:50:21,330 --> 02:50:23,270
Umm...

4653
02:50:23,270 --> 02:50:25,010
The mounting...

4654
02:50:25,010 --> 02:50:26,870
I need leather...

4655
02:50:26,870 --> 02:50:28,210
I can afford it...

4656
02:50:30,370 --> 02:50:32,890
Don't trust her lies...

4657
02:50:34,850 --> 02:50:36,350
Let's see...

4658
02:50:36,350 --> 02:50:37,520
It's production...

4659
02:50:38,310 --> 02:50:38,870
So...

4660
02:50:39,060 --> 02:50:41,230
High quality workbench...

4661
02:50:41,230 --> 02:50:42,250
Is it high quality workbench?

4662
02:50:43,850 --> 02:50:44,530
Wooo...

4663
02:50:46,210 --> 02:50:46,890
Umm...

4664
02:50:46,890 --> 02:50:48,430
What workbench was it?

4665
02:50:49,290 --> 02:50:51,830
See I feel like it wasn't high quality workbench...

4666
02:50:51,830 --> 02:50:51,990
Right?

4667
02:50:52,070 --> 02:50:53,470
It was like something else...

4668
02:50:54,610 --> 02:50:55,290
Tavern...

4669
02:50:55,290 --> 02:50:57,110
Wooden... Ranch...

4670
02:50:57,110 --> 02:50:57,250
Oh!

4671
02:50:57,290 --> 02:50:58,630
Pal gear... There we go...

4672
02:50:58,630 --> 02:51:00,570
I have everything for it...

4673
02:51:01,170 --> 02:51:03,070
Okay... Uhhhh...

4674
02:51:04,150 --> 02:51:05,770
Where is the pal gear...

4675
02:51:06,110 --> 02:51:07,870
Pal gear... Alright...

4676
02:51:09,510 --> 02:51:10,190
Alright...

4677
02:51:10,190 --> 02:51:12,990
Doki please help the Italian local join...

4678
02:51:12,990 --> 02:51:13,450
Up the...

4679
02:51:13,470 --> 02:51:15,370
Prices of hero subs with the real mozzarella...

4680
02:51:15,370 --> 02:51:16,650
To like $16...

4681
02:51:16,650 --> 02:51:18,210
I'm addicted to expensive...

4682
02:51:19,350 --> 02:51:20,030
Sandwiches...

4683
02:51:21,470 --> 02:51:22,830
Okay... Anton...

4684
02:51:22,830 --> 02:51:25,330
Did not understand what the complete box...

4685
02:51:25,330 --> 02:51:26,270
Was for...

4686
02:51:28,170 --> 02:51:29,770
I am not in charge...

4687
02:51:29,770 --> 02:51:30,950
Of the cafeteria...

4688
02:51:31,190 --> 02:51:33,150
Of the cafeteria sandwiches...

4689
02:51:34,470 --> 02:51:35,150
That...

4690
02:51:35,150 --> 02:51:37,230
Is a different branch...

4691
02:51:41,240 --> 02:51:41,920
Alright...

4692
02:51:41,920 --> 02:51:42,180
Thank you...

4693
02:51:45,320 --> 02:51:45,740
I have to...

4694
02:51:45,740 --> 02:51:48,040
This thing...

4695
02:51:48,040 --> 02:51:51,140
Alright... Get over here...

4696
02:51:51,140 --> 02:51:52,460
Uhhhh...

4697
02:51:52,460 --> 02:51:53,800
Let's see...

4698
02:51:53,800 --> 02:51:56,160
I saw the CEO stealing pens...

4699
02:51:56,160 --> 02:51:58,440
Of the supply closet...

4700
02:51:58,440 --> 02:51:59,140
Except for...

4701
02:51:59,140 --> 02:51:59,580
Thank you...

4702
02:51:59,580 --> 02:52:05,700
The fucking pens come from my paycheck...

4703
02:52:05,700 --> 02:52:06,080
Okay...

4704
02:52:06,080 --> 02:52:08,820
Technically I'm sharing my pens...

4705
02:52:08,820 --> 02:52:10,380
For all of you...

4706
02:52:10,380 --> 02:52:12,180
So you're welcome...

4707
02:52:12,180 --> 02:52:13,060
Hahaha...

4708
02:52:15,320 --> 02:52:15,780
Alright...

4709
02:52:16,960 --> 02:52:19,420
I'm gonna give this guy...

4710
02:52:19,420 --> 02:52:20,480
Okay... It's automatically...

4711
02:52:21,310 --> 02:52:21,700
Alright...

4712
02:52:23,070 --> 02:52:23,460
Ummm...

4713
02:52:25,190 --> 02:52:26,520
Then I have...

4714
02:52:27,540 --> 02:52:28,320
To...

4715
02:52:30,920 --> 02:52:31,700
Uhhhh...

4716
02:52:31,700 --> 02:52:32,520
Okay... There you go...

4717
02:52:32,970 --> 02:52:35,220
Alright... Do I need more balls?

4718
02:52:36,280 --> 02:52:37,060
No...

4719
02:52:37,060 --> 02:52:38,080
That should be enough...

4720
02:52:38,080 --> 02:52:40,580
That should be enough balls...

4721
02:52:40,580 --> 02:52:41,600
Alright... There you go...

4722
02:52:42,460 --> 02:52:43,080
Uhhhh...

4723
02:52:43,080 --> 02:52:44,800
Boss HR checking in...

4724
02:52:44,800 --> 02:52:47,560
They keep jamming the shredder on their complaint box by putting...

4725
02:52:48,380 --> 02:52:49,000
Hahaha...

4726
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:49,680
Thank you...

4727
02:52:49,680 --> 02:52:51,140
Thank you...

4728
02:52:52,720 --> 02:52:54,740
Oh... Just... Just put that...

4729
02:52:54,740 --> 02:52:56,480
Just put that in the...

4730
02:52:56,480 --> 02:52:58,900
Just put that in the complaint...

4731
02:52:58,900 --> 02:53:00,640
Put that complaint in the complaint box...

4732
02:53:00,640 --> 02:53:02,700
Don't worry... Somebody will get to your complaint...

4733
02:53:02,700 --> 02:53:04,120
Don't worry...

4734
02:53:04,120 --> 02:53:05,500
Maybe if I...

4735
02:53:05,500 --> 02:53:08,040
Sound blast from up here...

4736
02:53:08,040 --> 02:53:09,880
Haha... Wait... I can...

4737
02:53:09,880 --> 02:53:11,620
Okay... That's funny... I didn't know that...

4738
02:53:11,620 --> 02:53:13,020
Wait... I can...

4739
02:53:14,160 --> 02:53:14,920
Okay...

4740
02:53:15,700 --> 02:53:17,220
Whoa... He dodged it...

4741
02:53:18,160 --> 02:53:18,920
Nooooooooooo...

4742
02:53:20,940 --> 02:53:21,700
Nooooooooo...

4743
02:53:28,360 --> 02:53:29,500
Holy shit...

4744
02:53:29,880 --> 02:53:31,060
Okay... I caught him...

4745
02:53:31,060 --> 02:53:32,640
I caught him... Oh my god...

4746
02:53:32,640 --> 02:53:34,320
I gotta run now...

4747
02:53:34,320 --> 02:53:36,120
I gotta run...

4748
02:53:36,120 --> 02:53:37,980
Get over here...

4749
02:53:37,980 --> 02:53:40,700
I need to get you on the map...

4750
02:53:41,060 --> 02:53:42,220
Go run...

4751
02:53:43,340 --> 02:53:43,900
Okay... We're fine...

4752
02:53:43,900 --> 02:53:46,040
We're fine... He's not aggroed anymore...

4753
02:53:47,580 --> 02:53:48,140
Alright...

4754
02:53:49,580 --> 02:53:50,700
Let's see...

4755
02:53:52,380 --> 02:53:52,940
Uhhh...

4756
02:53:54,360 --> 02:53:54,920
Well...

4757
02:53:54,920 --> 02:53:56,180
Thank you for the super chat... Thank you...

4758
02:53:56,780 --> 02:53:59,520
Boss... IT here... They keep subscribing to porn...

4759
02:53:59,520 --> 02:54:01,400
And affecting the computer's virus...

4760
02:54:01,400 --> 02:54:03,340
Make it... You are part of the IT team...

4761
02:54:05,080 --> 02:54:05,640
Hahaha...

4762
02:54:05,640 --> 02:54:06,000
Hahaha...

4763
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:08,600
They... Do you mean you?

4764
02:54:09,440 --> 02:54:11,600
Alright... Let's see... Okay... I got a bird...

4765
02:54:11,600 --> 02:54:12,660
It's time...

4766
02:54:13,340 --> 02:54:14,100
It's time...

4767
02:54:14,100 --> 02:54:17,240
Wait... I didn't research it... Sorry... It's not time yet...

4768
02:54:18,200 --> 02:54:18,720
Hahaha...

4769
02:54:18,720 --> 02:54:19,020
Hahaha...

4770
02:54:21,240 --> 02:54:22,920
Okay... Give me a sec... Let me...

4771
02:54:22,920 --> 02:54:25,140
Let me grab this... Okay... I need...

4772
02:54:25,140 --> 02:54:26,620
Leather... Cloth...

4773
02:54:26,620 --> 02:54:28,880
And... Ink... I need 15...

4774
02:54:28,880 --> 02:54:29,720
Inkits?

4775
02:54:30,420 --> 02:54:32,440
Oh my god... How do I get cloth again?

4776
02:54:32,640 --> 02:54:34,680
Okay... I need to kill a lot of things...

4777
02:54:35,160 --> 02:54:36,580
Give me a sec...

4778
02:54:37,280 --> 02:54:37,800
Hahaha...

4779
02:54:39,440 --> 02:54:39,960
Alright...

4780
02:54:40,520 --> 02:54:42,380
We need fire...

4781
02:54:43,340 --> 02:54:43,820
And...

4782
02:54:43,820 --> 02:54:44,900
Alright...

4783
02:54:44,900 --> 02:54:48,260
Can't find a cafeteria... Sandwiches...

4784
02:54:48,260 --> 02:54:49,020
Where are they?

4785
02:54:49,200 --> 02:54:52,740
Oh my god... There's so many things I should have been doing...

4786
02:54:53,340 --> 02:54:53,900
Hahaha...

4787
02:54:53,900 --> 02:54:56,620
Okay... Campfire...

4788
02:54:56,620 --> 02:54:57,880
Do I not have campfires?

4789
02:54:57,920 --> 02:54:59,200
Did I not upgrade?

4790
02:54:59,980 --> 02:55:00,660
Okay...

4791
02:55:01,200 --> 02:55:01,540
Uhh...

4792
02:55:03,240 --> 02:55:05,620
Where the fuck is the campfire?

4793
02:55:06,380 --> 02:55:07,060
Alright...

4794
02:55:07,060 --> 02:55:08,660
Campfire... Okay...

4795
02:55:09,240 --> 02:55:10,220
Guys... We got a...

4796
02:55:10,220 --> 02:55:12,120
We're a bit of a mess right now...

4797
02:55:12,120 --> 02:55:13,160
Boom...

4798
02:55:13,160 --> 02:55:15,040
Build this...

4799
02:55:15,040 --> 02:55:17,500
Alright... And then...

4800
02:55:17,960 --> 02:55:20,020
We can upgrade...

4801
02:55:20,020 --> 02:55:21,240
Alright...

4802
02:55:21,240 --> 02:55:23,500
And then... Fire...

4803
02:55:23,500 --> 02:55:25,280
Give me my shit!

4804
02:55:25,580 --> 02:55:28,560
Alright... We gotta kill... What brings leather again, guys?

4805
02:55:30,180 --> 02:55:31,880
Does anyone remember what brings leather?

4806
02:55:32,080 --> 02:55:32,980
Cause I don't...

4807
02:55:33,900 --> 02:55:34,540
Hahaha...

4808
02:55:37,940 --> 02:55:40,100
You need a... No... We don't need a sec...

4809
02:55:40,220 --> 02:55:41,520
Your territory, Dragoon...

4810
02:55:41,520 --> 02:55:45,000
Don't worry, the complaints are definitely going towards me.

4811
02:55:45,080 --> 02:55:46,560
Guys, do not worry...

4812
02:55:47,980 --> 02:55:48,360
Hahaha...

4813
02:55:48,740 --> 02:55:48,780
Hahaha...

4814
02:55:50,180 --> 02:55:51,260
Don't worry...

4815
02:55:51,260 --> 02:55:52,660
I'm reading all...

4816
02:55:52,660 --> 02:55:55,820
The complaints are going straight to the CEO.

4817
02:55:56,180 --> 02:55:57,780
And I am reading...

4818
02:55:57,780 --> 02:56:00,440
Every single one of them...

4819
02:56:00,440 --> 02:56:02,720
Do not worry...

4820
02:56:02,720 --> 02:56:04,180
Hahaha...

4821
02:56:04,180 --> 02:56:05,100
Hahaha...

4822
02:56:05,100 --> 02:56:06,600
Do not...

4823
02:56:06,600 --> 02:56:12,240
I know it's weird when you're putting your complaints down, that you hear like the sound of the shredder going...

4824
02:56:12,240 --> 02:56:14,220
But that's just like...

4825
02:56:14,220 --> 02:56:17,740
That's just ambient noises from the sound effects team.

4826
02:56:17,940 --> 02:56:19,280
So don't worry guys.

4827
02:56:19,460 --> 02:56:22,580
You're not hearing any shredding going along.

4828
02:56:23,400 --> 02:56:26,560
I'm hearing every single one of your complaints.

4829
02:56:26,680 --> 02:56:27,780
I am here for you guys.

4830
02:56:28,580 --> 02:56:30,940
Okay, that should be enough I think.

4831
02:56:31,200 --> 02:56:32,020
Why are you angry?

4832
02:56:32,700 --> 02:56:35,680
I should be angry with all the hard work I'm doing.

4833
02:56:36,600 --> 02:56:38,760
I definitely need a repair wrench though.

4834
02:56:40,180 --> 02:56:42,040
It's just white noise.

4835
02:56:44,420 --> 02:56:44,980
Alright.

4836
02:56:46,200 --> 02:56:47,140
Let's see.

4837
02:56:49,500 --> 02:56:50,500
Okay, repair.

4838
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:53,560
Repair.

4839
02:56:55,940 --> 02:56:57,140
What do I need to do?

4840
02:56:57,780 --> 02:56:59,480
Oh yeah, I need more ore.

4841
02:56:59,900 --> 02:57:01,820
And then I need leather.

4842
02:57:01,980 --> 02:57:04,220
I need leather and cloth.

4843
02:57:04,560 --> 02:57:06,580
So that means I need to kill more of the sheep.

4844
02:57:06,600 --> 02:57:10,180
Sorry, I need to promote some of the sheep.

4845
02:57:10,540 --> 02:57:12,680
And where do I get leather again?

4846
02:57:15,020 --> 02:57:15,820
I don't remember.

4847
02:57:16,020 --> 02:57:17,420
I don't remember where to get leather.

4848
02:57:18,560 --> 02:57:20,940
Why is dental only available to Dragoon Prime?

4849
02:57:21,200 --> 02:57:22,000
They don't even have...

4850
02:57:28,120 --> 02:57:32,460
Maybe if you get promoted to Dragoon Prime, you would understand.

4851
02:57:32,820 --> 02:57:34,260
Thank you for the super chat.

4852
02:57:34,340 --> 02:57:35,220
Thank you.

4853
02:57:35,220 --> 02:57:35,620
Alright.

4854
02:57:36,640 --> 02:57:37,720
Are the foxes?

4855
02:57:37,920 --> 02:57:39,500
They were the foxes.

4856
02:57:39,920 --> 02:57:41,660
Alright, thanks for letting me know.

4857
02:57:43,780 --> 02:57:45,200
Thanks for letting me know.

4858
02:57:46,100 --> 02:57:46,580
Alright.

4859
02:57:46,700 --> 02:57:48,160
There should be foxes down here.

4860
02:57:53,080 --> 02:57:53,560
Hello?

4861
02:57:56,880 --> 02:57:58,240
Wait, where did the foxes go?

4862
02:57:59,520 --> 02:58:00,900
They were supposed to be here.

4863
02:58:01,500 --> 02:58:04,220
Why is it that every time...

4864
02:58:04,220 --> 02:58:05,040
Oh hey, there's free leather.

4865
02:58:05,300 --> 02:58:06,000
Okay, that's good.

4866
02:58:06,560 --> 02:58:07,420
Every time.

4867
02:58:07,420 --> 02:58:09,600
I need leather.

4868
02:58:09,760 --> 02:58:10,660
They just disappear.

4869
02:58:12,180 --> 02:58:13,120
Every time.

4870
02:58:15,760 --> 02:58:17,380
I just don't understand.

4871
02:58:22,220 --> 02:58:25,420
Okay, I need leather and I need to kill the sheep.

4872
02:58:25,660 --> 02:58:28,040
We saw a lot of the sheep earlier too.

4873
02:58:28,980 --> 02:58:31,280
There's only... where the fuck are they?

4874
02:58:31,780 --> 02:58:33,360
They should be around here.

4875
02:58:34,240 --> 02:58:35,960
Oh, I know you have wool.

4876
02:58:36,920 --> 02:58:37,960
I know.

4877
02:58:39,280 --> 02:58:40,660
Wait, what the fuck?

4878
02:58:42,940 --> 02:58:43,460
Alright.

4879
02:58:44,140 --> 02:58:45,240
No, you bring...

4880
02:58:45,240 --> 02:58:46,140
Oh wait, no, there we go.

4881
02:58:46,320 --> 02:58:46,680
Cloth.

4882
02:58:46,840 --> 02:58:48,040
I know, I needed the wool.

4883
02:58:48,500 --> 02:58:49,620
Alright, get over here.

4884
02:58:50,160 --> 02:58:50,720
What the...

4885
02:58:50,720 --> 02:58:51,060
Ping!

4886
02:58:51,960 --> 02:58:53,120
What is this ping?

4887
02:58:56,080 --> 02:58:57,620
Because you're fluffy.

4888
02:58:58,040 --> 02:58:59,200
That's why I knew.

4889
02:58:59,900 --> 02:59:01,640
Where the fuck are they?

4890
02:59:01,700 --> 02:59:02,820
It's almost night time.

4891
02:59:03,140 --> 02:59:05,680
They should be showing up from like...

4892
02:59:05,680 --> 02:59:05,940
Oh, I see.

4893
02:59:05,940 --> 02:59:07,820
Like, from this alone.

4894
02:59:08,320 --> 02:59:10,320
Oh well, I'll just kill you guys.

4895
02:59:11,660 --> 02:59:12,200
Double kill.

4896
02:59:13,440 --> 02:59:14,400
Double kill.

4897
02:59:15,160 --> 02:59:15,760
Alright.

4898
02:59:16,840 --> 02:59:17,440
Nice.

4899
02:59:17,460 --> 02:59:19,540
And then we're gonna grab the fast travel here.

4900
02:59:20,440 --> 02:59:22,160
And... did I grab the wool yet?

4901
02:59:22,200 --> 02:59:22,440
No.

4902
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:23,840
Wool time.

4903
02:59:24,740 --> 02:59:25,600
Wool time.

4904
02:59:27,340 --> 02:59:28,560
That's so odd.

4905
02:59:28,800 --> 02:59:29,820
That they're not here.

4906
02:59:32,940 --> 02:59:33,720
Let's see.

4907
02:59:36,680 --> 02:59:37,920
That's so odd.

4908
02:59:38,260 --> 02:59:39,660
Where the fuck are they?

4909
02:59:40,220 --> 02:59:41,680
Where are the foxes?

4910
02:59:41,900 --> 02:59:44,800
Am I gonna have to travel all the way here to find the foxes again?

4911
02:59:45,480 --> 02:59:46,640
Oh my god.

4912
02:59:46,760 --> 02:59:47,920
Our first home.

4913
02:59:51,600 --> 02:59:52,960
Remember where...

4914
02:59:52,960 --> 02:59:54,820
Remember where you came from.

4915
02:59:55,180 --> 02:59:56,640
Oh, there you are.

4916
02:59:57,760 --> 02:59:59,620
I actually had to.

4917
03:00:01,200 --> 03:00:01,880
Remember...

4918
03:00:01,880 --> 03:00:03,480
Your origin.

4919
03:00:04,240 --> 03:00:04,920
I'm so sorry.

4920
03:00:05,240 --> 03:00:05,920
I'm so sorry.

4921
03:00:05,940 --> 03:00:08,360
That's actually crazy that they're here.

4922
03:00:08,560 --> 03:00:09,120
Okay.

4923
03:00:12,440 --> 03:00:14,040
You remember this place?

4924
03:00:14,300 --> 03:00:14,840
Guys?

4925
03:00:16,200 --> 03:00:20,120
Boss, as an employee, do I get a pension plan and a 401k?

4926
03:00:20,240 --> 03:00:20,700
Yes!

4927
03:00:20,860 --> 03:00:21,700
You actually do!

4928
03:00:21,940 --> 03:00:23,600
Cyber, thank you for the super chat.

4929
03:00:23,700 --> 03:00:24,540
Thank you, thank you.

4930
03:00:24,620 --> 03:00:26,220
That's a really good question.

4931
03:00:26,400 --> 03:00:27,900
The moment you hit...

4932
03:00:27,900 --> 03:00:31,920
The moment you retire and leave the company, we...

4933
03:00:31,920 --> 03:00:35,660
You just have to go to the special room to your left.

4934
03:00:36,660 --> 03:00:38,740
There's an exit on the other side.

4935
03:00:38,880 --> 03:00:44,120
I know some of you guys are wondering like, hey, how come every time a dragoon goes into that special room, they don't come out?

4936
03:00:44,220 --> 03:00:47,020
It's because we actually have an exit door.

4937
03:00:47,460 --> 03:00:49,680
We have two doors in that room.

4938
03:00:49,800 --> 03:00:53,840
And the exit door is actually on the other side of the room.

4939
03:00:54,020 --> 03:00:55,980
And that's why you don't see them come out.

4940
03:01:00,180 --> 03:01:00,700
Yes.

4941
03:01:00,720 --> 03:01:08,260
Every time you hit retirement age and ready to retire with your pension plan and your 401k, remember to visit the special room.

4942
03:01:08,260 --> 03:01:10,580
It's where you can get an extra room to receive your pension plan.

4943
03:01:12,940 --> 03:01:14,200
Okay, do I have enough now?

4944
03:01:14,760 --> 03:01:15,720
I actually don't know.

4945
03:01:15,840 --> 03:01:16,340
I'm going to double check.

4946
03:01:21,690 --> 03:01:22,610
I'm going to double check.

4947
03:01:23,330 --> 03:01:24,910
Oh, wait, it's sleep time.

4948
03:01:25,130 --> 03:01:25,870
It's sleep time.

4949
03:01:26,630 --> 03:01:27,470
Do I have enough?

4950
03:01:27,550 --> 03:01:28,350
Let me double check though.

4951
03:01:29,110 --> 03:01:29,990
We need...

4952
03:01:29,990 --> 03:01:30,730
Oh my God.

4953
03:01:30,810 --> 03:01:32,610
We need so much more.

4954
03:01:34,110 --> 03:01:35,810
Okay, we need...

4955
03:01:35,810 --> 03:01:37,690
We need 20 lez...

4956
03:01:37,690 --> 03:01:39,050
I have to kill so many...

4957
03:01:39,510 --> 03:01:41,450
I mean, I have to re-edge.

4958
03:01:41,570 --> 03:01:41,910
Okay.

4959
03:01:41,930 --> 03:01:43,470
I

4960
03:01:48,680 --> 03:01:51,420
have to promote so many foxes?

4961
03:01:52,100 --> 03:01:54,780
I can't believe I have to promote so many!

4962
03:01:58,840 --> 03:01:59,960
Oh my god!

4963
03:02:00,140 --> 03:02:03,260
I have to promote so many foxes!

4964
03:02:03,980 --> 03:02:05,100
That's crazy.

4965
03:02:05,700 --> 03:02:06,320
Okay.

4966
03:02:06,960 --> 03:02:09,280
You're promoted and you're promoted.

4967
03:02:10,780 --> 03:02:11,980
And congratulations!

4968
03:02:12,140 --> 03:02:14,040
You get a promotion too!

4969
03:02:14,040 --> 03:02:16,620
You just got hired and you got promoted!

4970
03:02:17,600 --> 03:02:18,700
So lucky.

4971
03:02:19,240 --> 03:02:20,860
And you get promoted!

4972
03:02:23,020 --> 03:02:23,900
Let's see.

4973
03:02:23,980 --> 03:02:24,220
What?

4974
03:02:24,680 --> 03:02:25,200
What?

4975
03:02:26,240 --> 03:02:29,200
God, it's so great to work for Doki Bird Productions.

4976
03:02:30,340 --> 03:02:32,040
No, not promotion.

4977
03:02:32,880 --> 03:02:33,780
Oh my god!

4978
03:02:34,220 --> 03:02:34,820
Congratulations!

4979
03:02:34,940 --> 03:02:36,460
You are what we're looking for!

4980
03:02:36,640 --> 03:02:37,660
You have the face!

4981
03:02:38,080 --> 03:02:39,200
And the leather.

4982
03:02:39,740 --> 03:02:40,760
And you too!

4983
03:02:41,360 --> 03:02:42,680
Promotions for everybody!

4984
03:02:45,500 --> 03:02:47,040
Oh, why don't you want to get promoted?

4985
03:02:47,240 --> 03:02:47,840
I don't understand.

4986
03:02:49,580 --> 03:02:49,940
Um...

4987
03:02:50,620 --> 03:02:51,360
That's a Deadpool!

4988
03:02:51,520 --> 03:02:52,400
Thank you for the super chat!

4989
03:02:52,480 --> 03:02:52,740
Thank you!

4990
03:02:52,780 --> 03:02:53,240
Oh my god!

4991
03:02:53,260 --> 03:02:53,860
Is that a golden?

4992
03:02:53,900 --> 03:02:54,860
No, that's a regular egg.

4993
03:02:55,100 --> 03:02:55,780
God damn it.

4994
03:02:56,080 --> 03:02:57,480
I thought that was a golden egg.

4995
03:02:57,960 --> 03:02:59,360
A golden egg opportunity.

4996
03:03:00,880 --> 03:03:01,540
That's a Deadpool!

4997
03:03:01,640 --> 03:03:02,360
Thank you for the super chat!

4998
03:03:02,440 --> 03:03:02,700
Thank you!

4999
03:03:02,740 --> 03:03:03,320
Thank you!

5000
03:03:03,960 --> 03:03:04,560
Janner here.

5001
03:03:04,860 --> 03:03:09,080
The garbage chute in the time room keeps getting clogged with these really heavy trash bags.

5002
03:03:09,300 --> 03:03:12,280
I could really use some help cleaning it out.

5003
03:03:12,280 --> 03:03:13,440
Thank you for the super chat!

5004
03:03:13,520 --> 03:03:14,000
Thank you, thank you!

5005
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:15,120
Thanks for letting me know!

5006
03:03:16,340 --> 03:03:18,040
Sorry we only have one janitor.

5007
03:03:18,300 --> 03:03:20,960
We couldn't really afford to hire another one.

5008
03:03:23,360 --> 03:03:24,320
An egg!

5009
03:03:24,500 --> 03:03:26,660
I can raise this orphan myself!

5010
03:03:29,940 --> 03:03:30,460
Nice!

5011
03:03:33,120 --> 03:03:33,640
Alright.

5012
03:03:34,500 --> 03:03:35,240
Let's see.

5013
03:03:35,600 --> 03:03:37,120
I thought you guys wanted promotions.

5014
03:03:37,260 --> 03:03:38,000
What happened?

5015
03:03:38,920 --> 03:03:40,320
You guys want to get promoted?

5016
03:03:42,280 --> 03:03:42,600
Hahaha!

5017
03:03:44,540 --> 03:03:47,340
You guys were like, I want a promotion too!

5018
03:03:47,520 --> 03:03:50,800
Why do these dragons get promoted and I don't?

5019
03:03:51,960 --> 03:03:52,440
Alright.

5020
03:03:52,980 --> 03:03:55,200
Let's grab... let's get these guys out of the way.

5021
03:03:55,400 --> 03:03:55,880
Whoa!

5022
03:03:56,340 --> 03:03:57,060
Come on!

5023
03:03:57,460 --> 03:03:57,940
Whoa!

5024
03:03:58,620 --> 03:03:59,360
Come on!

5025
03:04:00,820 --> 03:04:01,300
Alright.

5026
03:04:02,580 --> 03:04:04,120
Oh, why are you running?

5027
03:04:05,080 --> 03:04:05,560
Hey!

5028
03:04:05,920 --> 03:04:07,320
Why are you running?

5029
03:04:08,480 --> 03:04:09,820
Why are you running?

5030
03:04:12,120 --> 03:04:12,720
Hey!

5031
03:04:16,180 --> 03:04:16,780
Whoo!

5032
03:04:16,780 --> 03:04:17,800
Okay, nice.

5033
03:04:17,980 --> 03:04:18,720
Do I have enough?

5034
03:04:20,480 --> 03:04:21,360
Let's see.

5035
03:04:22,560 --> 03:04:23,560
Cloth, 13.

5036
03:04:23,780 --> 03:04:25,500
Was it... how many leather do we need in?

5037
03:04:25,660 --> 03:04:26,520
Was it 15?

5038
03:04:26,900 --> 03:04:27,780
Or 20?

5039
03:04:32,460 --> 03:04:33,660
Native reinforcements.

5040
03:04:35,480 --> 03:04:36,700
You need 20?

5041
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:37,480
Okay.

5042
03:04:38,160 --> 03:04:39,200
Oh my god.

5043
03:04:39,280 --> 03:04:39,800
We're almost done.

5044
03:04:39,800 --> 03:04:40,200
Almost there.

5045
03:04:40,680 --> 03:04:44,660
The things we do to see the oil rig.

5046
03:04:44,920 --> 03:04:48,280
I just wanted to see the oil rig!

5047
03:04:48,700 --> 03:04:52,580
That's all I... I just wanted my cheese!

5048
03:04:54,320 --> 03:04:54,980
Alright, nice.

5049
03:04:55,500 --> 03:04:56,200
Okay.

5050
03:04:58,460 --> 03:04:59,260
Uh...

5051
03:05:00,080 --> 03:05:01,940
The elk... does elk give you leather?

5052
03:05:04,900 --> 03:05:05,300
Hahaha!

5053
03:05:06,820 --> 03:05:07,220
Alright.

5054
03:05:08,160 --> 03:05:09,480
Come over here.

5055
03:05:11,460 --> 03:05:11,900
Okay.

5056
03:05:13,380 --> 03:05:13,820
Okay.

5057
03:05:13,840 --> 03:05:14,300
You know what?

5058
03:05:14,360 --> 03:05:15,480
You can fight him yourself.

5059
03:05:15,680 --> 03:05:17,060
I don't want to control them anymore.

5060
03:05:17,380 --> 03:05:19,100
You can fight it yourself, direwolf.

5061
03:05:19,140 --> 03:05:19,740
You got this.

5062
03:05:19,800 --> 03:05:20,840
Wait, actually I want to catch him.

5063
03:05:21,520 --> 03:05:21,960
Alright.

5064
03:05:22,040 --> 03:05:23,600
Then you kill this other guy.

5065
03:05:25,760 --> 03:05:26,200
Nice.

5066
03:05:26,840 --> 03:05:27,480
Oh, okay.

5067
03:05:27,560 --> 03:05:28,840
I guess I don't need the elk.

5068
03:05:29,020 --> 03:05:29,900
I guess... No!

5069
03:05:29,980 --> 03:05:31,100
They don't even give leather!

5070
03:05:32,300 --> 03:05:32,740
No!

5071
03:05:34,780 --> 03:05:36,960
They don't even give leather!

5072
03:05:37,660 --> 03:05:38,300
Oh, hey.

5073
03:05:38,300 --> 03:05:41,360
Oh my god, everybody uses you as employees!

5074
03:05:42,060 --> 03:05:44,940
Because you don't even need to pay.

5075
03:05:45,800 --> 03:05:47,940
You are the optimal employee.

5076
03:05:48,180 --> 03:05:49,020
Don't shoot me.

5077
03:05:49,100 --> 03:05:49,620
Don't shoot me.

5078
03:05:49,740 --> 03:05:50,740
Don't shoot me.

5079
03:05:50,740 --> 03:05:51,340
Don't shoot me.

5080
03:05:51,380 --> 03:05:51,600
Nice.

5081
03:05:51,680 --> 03:05:51,920
Okay.

5082
03:05:52,180 --> 03:05:54,140
We got optimal employee here.

5083
03:05:56,520 --> 03:05:58,800
They don't even... Who said elk?

5084
03:05:59,140 --> 03:06:00,580
Because you're going to get a promotion.

5085
03:06:01,600 --> 03:06:02,120
Hahaha!

5086
03:06:05,160 --> 03:06:07,800
Whoever said elk, congratulations.

5087
03:06:07,800 --> 03:06:08,280
Whoever said elk, congratulations.

5088
03:06:08,280 --> 03:06:10,760
You're getting a promotion very soon.

5089
03:06:12,320 --> 03:06:13,080
See.

5090
03:06:14,160 --> 03:06:15,600
No, please!

5091
03:06:16,600 --> 03:06:17,360
Hahaha!

5092
03:06:18,660 --> 03:06:19,900
For that...

5093
03:06:19,900 --> 03:06:23,740
For that wonderful idea that you had.

5094
03:06:24,140 --> 03:06:24,900
Hahaha!

5095
03:06:27,840 --> 03:06:28,600
Hahaha!

5096
03:06:29,180 --> 03:06:30,700
Thank you for the super chat.

5097
03:06:30,820 --> 03:06:31,700
Thank you, Kaz.

5098
03:06:32,180 --> 03:06:34,880
Hey, that looks just like my office.

5099
03:06:36,440 --> 03:06:37,200
Alright.

5100
03:06:37,300 --> 03:06:38,260
Let's... I'm going to find...

5101
03:06:40,080 --> 03:06:41,580
What is it?

5102
03:06:41,680 --> 03:06:42,020
Me.

5103
03:06:43,180 --> 03:06:43,760
Alright.

5104
03:06:43,840 --> 03:06:45,380
We need to find a merchant.

5105
03:06:45,780 --> 03:06:46,360
So...

5106
03:06:47,130 --> 03:06:48,720
Try to remember the town for it.

5107
03:06:48,980 --> 03:06:51,380
Because I know we can find the town for that too.

5108
03:06:51,960 --> 03:06:53,720
Let's just kill these guys.

5109
03:06:54,160 --> 03:06:55,300
For easy leather.

5110
03:06:55,940 --> 03:06:57,000
Oh, not easy leather.

5111
03:06:57,060 --> 03:06:59,980
Easy wool that we can make into the saddle.

5112
03:07:01,300 --> 03:07:02,500
Oh my god.

5113
03:07:03,240 --> 03:07:05,460
The things we do for leather.

5114
03:07:05,620 --> 03:07:05,960
Oh!

5115
03:07:05,960 --> 03:07:06,100
Oh!

5116
03:07:06,780 --> 03:07:07,820
We can loot this!

5117
03:07:09,940 --> 03:07:11,760
We can loot while we're on the mount!

5118
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:12,560
Let's go!

5119
03:07:14,120 --> 03:07:14,600
Alright.

5120
03:07:15,380 --> 03:07:19,320
Yeah, I'm trying to... I'm trying to find...

5121
03:07:19,320 --> 03:07:20,240
Do they give leather?

5122
03:07:20,340 --> 03:07:20,960
What do they give?

5123
03:07:23,480 --> 03:07:24,140
Oh, they do!

5124
03:07:24,680 --> 03:07:25,840
Oh my god!

5125
03:07:25,920 --> 03:07:27,720
You're cute and useful!

5126
03:07:29,100 --> 03:07:29,940
Alright, nice.

5127
03:07:30,640 --> 03:07:31,120
Alright.

5128
03:07:32,120 --> 03:07:35,540
Okay, we have... 15... Oh my god, we're almost there.

5129
03:07:38,640 --> 03:07:39,900
We're almost there.

5130
03:07:40,640 --> 03:07:41,980
We're almost there.

5131
03:07:43,920 --> 03:07:45,360
Alright, it's this way.

5132
03:07:48,320 --> 03:07:49,360
And then...

5133
03:07:50,120 --> 03:07:50,380
Yeah.

5134
03:07:52,640 --> 03:07:53,780
Where are you?

5135
03:07:54,000 --> 03:07:56,960
I'm gonna get off this to mine this...

5136
03:07:56,960 --> 03:07:58,260
for a little bit.

5137
03:07:58,340 --> 03:08:00,720
Because I think we need a little bit of ore too.

5138
03:08:01,240 --> 03:08:02,240
I'm pretty sure.

5139
03:08:02,700 --> 03:08:05,100
I'm pretty sure we're like missing a little bit of ore.

5140
03:08:06,820 --> 03:08:08,480
I think like... 5 more?

5141
03:08:08,760 --> 03:08:09,220
Maybe?

5142
03:08:09,700 --> 03:08:10,260
Right?

5143
03:08:10,360 --> 03:08:10,800
I don't know.

5144
03:08:10,860 --> 03:08:11,700
Just in case.

5145
03:08:12,040 --> 03:08:13,020
Just in case.

5146
03:08:13,240 --> 03:08:14,920
I don't know where to buy leather!

5147
03:08:16,680 --> 03:08:18,400
I don't remember the town!

5148
03:08:18,580 --> 03:08:19,580
It's been too long!

5149
03:08:21,980 --> 03:08:23,420
It's been too long!

5150
03:08:23,760 --> 03:08:26,040
I don't remember where the town is!

5151
03:08:30,300 --> 03:08:30,580
Okay.

5152
03:08:31,480 --> 03:08:33,720
Because we enhanced it for catching...

5153
03:08:33,720 --> 03:08:34,360
Oh hey!

5154
03:08:34,480 --> 03:08:35,000
It's him!

5155
03:08:35,960 --> 03:08:36,140
What?

5156
03:08:37,840 --> 03:08:38,880
Oh shit.

5157
03:08:39,040 --> 03:08:39,580
You're hungry?

5158
03:08:43,230 --> 03:08:44,260
Alright, don't worry.

5159
03:08:44,660 --> 03:08:45,820
Wait, he's new.

5160
03:08:48,180 --> 03:08:48,800
Hello?

5161
03:08:49,680 --> 03:08:51,260
Oh, he's a dog coin!

5162
03:08:51,600 --> 03:08:52,460
This is what I mean!

5163
03:08:53,720 --> 03:08:55,160
He's a dog coin!

5164
03:08:56,710 --> 03:08:57,600
He's the NFT!

5165
03:09:00,500 --> 03:09:01,120
Uh...

5166
03:09:01,960 --> 03:09:04,060
Life fruit... that slightly increases.

5167
03:09:04,060 --> 03:09:06,900
All-purpose pallet extract.

5168
03:09:09,800 --> 03:09:10,480
Uh...

5169
03:09:10,480 --> 03:09:13,840
A mysterious extract that can be injected into the pallet.

5170
03:09:13,960 --> 03:09:17,460
The multi-climate and exciter that raises heat and cold.

5171
03:09:17,760 --> 03:09:18,840
Ring of fright?

5172
03:09:19,260 --> 03:09:19,840
Whoa!

5173
03:09:20,040 --> 03:09:21,020
That's a lot!

5174
03:09:22,420 --> 03:09:23,760
Shaped like a...

5175
03:09:23,760 --> 03:09:25,000
I don't have enough dog coin.

5176
03:09:25,620 --> 03:09:27,120
Oh wait, I want this?

5177
03:09:29,780 --> 03:09:31,300
Wait, I wanna have a hat?

5178
03:09:32,100 --> 03:09:33,240
That's so cute!

5179
03:09:33,440 --> 03:09:34,980
I need 50 dog coin?

5180
03:09:35,600 --> 03:09:38,000
How do I get 50 dog coin?

5181
03:09:42,440 --> 03:09:43,720
This is not fair!

5182
03:09:46,560 --> 03:09:47,600
That's not fair!

5183
03:09:49,520 --> 03:09:52,620
I don't wanna get fucking... more dog coin!

5184
03:09:53,440 --> 03:09:55,580
Guys, why did we not invest in that?

5185
03:09:55,860 --> 03:09:56,500
Okay.

5186
03:09:56,700 --> 03:09:58,360
I shouldn't joke about that.

5187
03:10:01,140 --> 03:10:03,480
I shouldn't joke about that.

5188
03:10:03,620 --> 03:10:03,900
I shouldn't joke about that.

5189
03:10:09,200 --> 03:10:10,480
Oh my god.

5190
03:10:10,540 --> 03:10:10,780
Oh my god.

5191
03:10:10,780 --> 03:10:10,820
Oh my god.

5192
03:10:10,820 --> 03:10:12,040
We need more leather.

5193
03:10:14,860 --> 03:10:16,080
Okay, let's see.

5194
03:10:16,220 --> 03:10:16,960
West of here.

5195
03:10:17,120 --> 03:10:17,760
Is it this way?

5196
03:10:19,580 --> 03:10:21,540
Who embezzled all their dog coin?

5197
03:10:24,240 --> 03:10:28,080
Alright, let's see.

5198
03:10:29,820 --> 03:10:30,800
Wait, is that the town?

5199
03:10:30,960 --> 03:10:31,520
That's the town!

5200
03:10:31,520 --> 03:10:32,980
Cause there's smoke coming from it!

5201
03:10:33,500 --> 03:10:34,980
It has to be this town!

5202
03:10:35,960 --> 03:10:36,920
There's no fall damage!

5203
03:10:37,180 --> 03:10:37,540
I remembered!

5204
03:10:37,960 --> 03:10:38,440
Yeah.

5205
03:10:38,800 --> 03:10:39,700
Oh thank god.

5206
03:10:39,860 --> 03:10:40,140
I... I...

5207
03:10:40,140 --> 03:10:41,480
That was so risky.

5208
03:10:41,620 --> 03:10:42,860
I actually don't remember that.

5209
03:10:45,320 --> 03:10:45,800
To...

5210
03:10:46,420 --> 03:10:48,320
To be fair, I actually don't remember.

5211
03:10:50,940 --> 03:10:51,420
Alright.

5212
03:10:51,720 --> 03:10:53,160
I know you have leather.

5213
03:10:53,640 --> 03:10:55,960
I know you have leather and I'm desperate.

5214
03:10:58,200 --> 03:10:58,820
Let's see.

5215
03:10:58,860 --> 03:10:59,640
Oh, there's more woes!

5216
03:11:00,220 --> 03:11:01,380
There's more woes!

5217
03:11:01,840 --> 03:11:03,000
We don't need the egg.

5218
03:11:03,060 --> 03:11:04,140
We have enough orphans.

5219
03:11:05,400 --> 03:11:06,360
Um, alright.

5220
03:11:06,500 --> 03:11:07,040
That's good.

5221
03:11:07,100 --> 03:11:07,860
We need the woes.

5222
03:11:09,040 --> 03:11:09,500
Okay.

5223
03:11:09,640 --> 03:11:10,040
Boop!

5224
03:11:10,880 --> 03:11:11,340
Boop!

5225
03:11:11,500 --> 03:11:11,960
Nice.

5226
03:11:12,580 --> 03:11:13,420
Get over here.

5227
03:11:13,800 --> 03:11:14,680
Get over here.

5228
03:11:15,720 --> 03:11:16,180
Nice.

5229
03:11:16,240 --> 03:11:16,420
Alright.

5230
03:11:16,660 --> 03:11:17,660
Oh, that's two leather!

5231
03:11:17,760 --> 03:11:19,160
He was extra thick, guys!

5232
03:11:20,060 --> 03:11:20,940
Get over here!

5233
03:11:23,020 --> 03:11:23,480
Wait.

5234
03:11:23,480 --> 03:11:23,940
Actually...

5235
03:11:24,780 --> 03:11:26,700
Oh, that's a lot of thugs!

5236
03:11:27,560 --> 03:11:28,460
That's a lot!

5237
03:11:28,460 --> 03:11:29,560
You know what?

5238
03:11:29,680 --> 03:11:30,940
You guys get over here.

5239
03:11:32,240 --> 03:11:32,760
Alright.

5240
03:11:34,600 --> 03:11:35,620
I want you.

5241
03:11:37,000 --> 03:11:38,540
I want you and my team.

5242
03:11:39,940 --> 03:11:40,460
Alright.

5243
03:11:40,520 --> 03:11:41,320
Get over here.

5244
03:11:41,800 --> 03:11:42,320
Hey!

5245
03:11:43,860 --> 03:11:44,580
Don't worry.

5246
03:11:45,360 --> 03:11:49,140
You're gonna love living in my... You're gonna love working for my company!

5247
03:11:49,640 --> 03:11:50,780
You're an orphan now!

5248
03:11:50,860 --> 03:11:51,820
You have no family!

5249
03:11:51,920 --> 03:11:53,300
The syndicate was your family?

5250
03:11:53,520 --> 03:11:53,840
No.

5251
03:11:54,400 --> 03:11:56,600
This... This is your family now.

5252
03:11:58,820 --> 03:12:02,960
Join us today in Doughkeeper Incorporated.

5253
03:12:05,800 --> 03:12:07,160
Um... 19.

5254
03:12:07,360 --> 03:12:08,980
God, I need one more leather.

5255
03:12:09,080 --> 03:12:10,840
I actually just need one.

5256
03:12:11,320 --> 03:12:12,000
Alright.

5257
03:12:12,260 --> 03:12:13,020
Let's see.

5258
03:12:13,880 --> 03:12:15,320
I just need one more.

5259
03:12:16,820 --> 03:12:17,500
Alright.

5260
03:12:17,600 --> 03:12:18,420
Where are you?

5261
03:12:18,760 --> 03:12:20,060
Where are you?

5262
03:12:21,680 --> 03:12:23,080
I need leather!

5263
03:12:23,720 --> 03:12:25,400
Where did we see the smoke again?

5264
03:12:25,500 --> 03:12:25,920
Right here?

5265
03:12:26,620 --> 03:12:27,860
We need to kill anything.

5266
03:12:28,120 --> 03:12:28,720
Just anything!

5267
03:12:30,140 --> 03:12:32,000
All this for the oil ring.

5268
03:12:33,240 --> 03:12:34,140
The wolves!

5269
03:12:35,380 --> 03:12:37,180
I knew they won't fail me.

5270
03:12:41,500 --> 03:12:42,540
Oh my god.

5271
03:12:45,680 --> 03:12:46,200
Okay.

5272
03:12:46,200 --> 03:12:46,720
Nice.

5273
03:12:48,200 --> 03:12:48,720
Nice.

5274
03:12:48,800 --> 03:12:49,020
Alright.

5275
03:12:49,620 --> 03:12:50,440
Is that it?

5276
03:12:50,540 --> 03:12:50,780
Alright.

5277
03:12:50,840 --> 03:12:51,060
Goodbye.

5278
03:12:52,500 --> 03:12:53,780
That's all I need.

5279
03:12:56,380 --> 03:12:56,900
Alright.

5280
03:12:57,000 --> 03:12:57,260
Goodbye.

5281
03:12:57,380 --> 03:12:59,340
You guys can have your pal world...

5282
03:12:59,340 --> 03:13:00,420
Pal world war.

5283
03:13:00,580 --> 03:13:01,180
I don't care.

5284
03:13:01,480 --> 03:13:03,120
I got what I needed.

5285
03:13:04,100 --> 03:13:05,980
I got everything I need.

5286
03:13:07,740 --> 03:13:08,260
Alright.

5287
03:13:12,440 --> 03:13:13,480
Let's see...

5288
03:13:13,480 --> 03:13:14,200
Wait.

5289
03:13:14,200 --> 03:13:14,660
How do I...

5290
03:13:15,420 --> 03:13:17,120
Where's the... Oh, it's here.

5291
03:13:17,300 --> 03:13:17,540
Okay.

5292
03:13:17,580 --> 03:13:19,500
I need to get off this so I can climb.

5293
03:13:20,220 --> 03:13:21,080
Climb, Doki!

5294
03:13:21,240 --> 03:13:21,760
Climb!

5295
03:13:22,580 --> 03:13:23,120
Climb!

5296
03:13:23,560 --> 03:13:24,100
Climb!

5297
03:13:25,800 --> 03:13:26,340
Okay.

5298
03:13:26,960 --> 03:13:27,900
And then where?

5299
03:13:28,720 --> 03:13:29,920
And then where is it?

5300
03:13:30,100 --> 03:13:31,480
Where the fuck is it?

5301
03:13:31,720 --> 03:13:34,240
I don't remember where the checkpoint is.

5302
03:13:34,520 --> 03:13:35,440
Is it over there?

5303
03:13:36,720 --> 03:13:37,660
Oh, it's over there!

5304
03:13:37,860 --> 03:13:38,260
Okay.

5305
03:13:39,640 --> 03:13:40,180
Alright.

5306
03:13:41,260 --> 03:13:42,460
This is so convenient.

5307
03:13:43,800 --> 03:13:45,340
This is actually so convenient.

5308
03:13:45,860 --> 03:13:48,420
We got the... We got it, Dragwings!

5309
03:13:48,440 --> 03:13:50,920
We can finally afford...

5310
03:13:50,920 --> 03:13:54,060
We can finally make the saddle!

5311
03:13:54,360 --> 03:13:56,660
It only took 20 years!

5312
03:13:57,500 --> 03:13:58,960
But we made it!

5313
03:14:01,580 --> 03:14:04,660
It only took 20 years!

5314
03:14:05,060 --> 03:14:06,740
Where the fuck is the...

5315
03:14:06,740 --> 03:14:07,160
Okay.

5316
03:14:07,220 --> 03:14:07,720
There you go.

5317
03:14:07,920 --> 03:14:09,620
How many more do we need?

5318
03:14:10,900 --> 03:14:11,540
Okay.

5319
03:14:11,860 --> 03:14:12,820
Ooh, items!

5320
03:14:14,720 --> 03:14:15,360
Uhhh...

5321
03:14:15,620 --> 03:14:15,940
Wait.

5322
03:14:15,960 --> 03:14:16,700
We don't have enough ingots.

5323
03:14:16,960 --> 03:14:18,320
Are you fucking kidding me?

5324
03:14:18,480 --> 03:14:18,980
We don't...

5325
03:14:20,920 --> 03:14:21,380
No.

5326
03:14:21,840 --> 03:14:22,480
No!

5327
03:14:23,460 --> 03:14:26,200
We don't have enough ingots.

5328
03:14:29,180 --> 03:14:30,360
Oh my god.

5329
03:14:30,440 --> 03:14:32,040
We were almost there.

5330
03:14:32,460 --> 03:14:34,200
We were almost there.

5331
03:14:34,560 --> 03:14:36,740
I thought I had enough.

5332
03:14:37,780 --> 03:14:41,160
I thought I had enough ingots!

5333
03:14:41,740 --> 03:14:42,900
Okay, I have five.

5334
03:14:43,160 --> 03:14:44,460
I have five ores.

5335
03:14:44,540 --> 03:14:45,100
Is that enough?

5336
03:14:45,180 --> 03:14:45,880
That should be enough.

5337
03:14:46,220 --> 03:14:47,660
Oh no, he's here.

5338
03:14:48,700 --> 03:14:50,460
No, not the Mammoth Swine.

5339
03:14:50,920 --> 03:14:52,540
Not the Mammoth Rest.

5340
03:14:52,960 --> 03:14:54,020
Sorry, that was the...

5341
03:14:54,020 --> 03:14:55,560
That was the Pokemon version.

5342
03:14:56,280 --> 03:14:57,180
This should be it.

5343
03:14:57,220 --> 03:14:57,960
We should have enough now.

5344
03:14:58,180 --> 03:14:58,560
Right?

5345
03:14:59,320 --> 03:15:01,540
We back in the mines we go.

5346
03:15:01,820 --> 03:15:02,960
This should be enough.

5347
03:15:03,200 --> 03:15:04,560
This has to be enough.

5348
03:15:04,620 --> 03:15:05,260
There's no way.

5349
03:15:06,300 --> 03:15:07,120
Where's the fire?

5350
03:15:09,500 --> 03:15:10,020
Okay.

5351
03:15:10,240 --> 03:15:11,000
Let's see.

5352
03:15:11,100 --> 03:15:11,700
We're in cancer.

5353
03:15:12,740 --> 03:15:13,780
And then...

5354
03:15:13,780 --> 03:15:14,520
Nine.

5355
03:15:15,180 --> 03:15:15,960
There we go.

5356
03:15:16,800 --> 03:15:17,740
Where are you?

5357
03:15:18,060 --> 03:15:19,880
Where the fuck is the fire guy?

5358
03:15:19,880 --> 03:15:21,480
Get in here.

5359
03:15:23,200 --> 03:15:23,720
Alright.

5360
03:15:24,200 --> 03:15:25,020
Let's see.

5361
03:15:26,360 --> 03:15:29,200
And then I need a Craft Cloth.

5362
03:15:31,020 --> 03:15:31,540
Okay.

5363
03:15:32,760 --> 03:15:33,980
Now craft it.

5364
03:15:34,020 --> 03:15:34,380
I'm fast.

5365
03:15:34,680 --> 03:15:35,180
Alright.

5366
03:15:38,040 --> 03:15:39,060
Alright, here we go.

5367
03:15:39,140 --> 03:15:39,580
Don't worry.

5368
03:15:39,800 --> 03:15:40,920
This should be enough.

5369
03:15:41,360 --> 03:15:44,480
I think we finally got this.

5370
03:15:45,180 --> 03:15:46,020
Is it cloth?

5371
03:15:46,560 --> 03:15:48,720
No, it would be so funny if it wasn't cloth.

5372
03:15:54,860 --> 03:15:55,980
It would be so funny if it was cloth.

5373
03:15:56,880 --> 03:15:58,880
Oh no.

5374
03:16:00,660 --> 03:16:01,780
Noooooooooo!

5375
03:16:05,340 --> 03:16:08,580
I literally just needed...

5376
03:16:11,580 --> 03:16:14,920
I needed

5377
03:16:19,650 --> 03:16:20,430
two ink.

5378
03:16:20,590 --> 03:16:21,610
I needed...

5379
03:16:21,770 --> 03:16:24,730
I literally just needed two ink.

5380
03:16:24,730 --> 03:16:26,090
Fox part.

5381
03:16:26,330 --> 03:16:27,350
Please...

5382
03:16:28,970 --> 03:16:29,530
Leave.

5383
03:16:29,910 --> 03:16:30,590
Leave!

5384
03:16:34,310 --> 03:16:37,290
I literally need two ingots.

5385
03:16:37,390 --> 03:16:41,150
That's all I just need to ingot.

5386
03:16:44,350 --> 03:16:47,530
That's all I need just burn

5387
03:16:50,690 --> 03:16:52,650
All right, that's fine.

5388
03:16:52,750 --> 03:16:53,270
We don't care.

5389
03:16:53,830 --> 03:16:54,650
It's fine.

5390
03:16:54,790 --> 03:16:57,090
We we're still around.

5391
03:16:57,370 --> 03:16:58,310
We're still okay.

5392
03:17:01,010 --> 03:17:02,530
Oh my god.

5393
03:17:02,910 --> 03:17:04,590
Hey, one.

5394
03:17:06,690 --> 03:17:09,450
Oh my god, that shit's almost broken.

5395
03:17:09,950 --> 03:17:12,570
Is it just that that took a beating?

5396
03:17:12,990 --> 03:17:13,730
Oh, no.

5397
03:17:13,790 --> 03:17:14,050
Okay.

5398
03:17:14,150 --> 03:17:16,230
No, it's like that in the berry.

5399
03:17:16,950 --> 03:17:19,370
Oh, it's just these two that took a beating.

5400
03:17:19,970 --> 03:17:21,430
All right, come on.

5401
03:17:21,650 --> 03:17:23,370
To to

5402
03:17:31,370 --> 03:17:32,410
All right.

5403
03:17:33,290 --> 03:17:34,190
There we go.

5404
03:17:34,310 --> 03:17:35,850
Oh my god, we finally did it.

5405
03:17:35,890 --> 03:17:36,450
We made it.

5406
03:17:37,370 --> 03:17:38,870
We fucking made it.

5407
03:17:40,670 --> 03:17:43,270
We fucking made a goddamn saddle.

5408
03:17:43,550 --> 03:17:44,730
Oh my god.

5409
03:17:44,770 --> 03:17:46,090
Okay, where are my workers?

5410
03:17:47,510 --> 03:17:47,730
All right.

5411
03:17:51,780 --> 03:17:52,760
There we go.

5412
03:17:53,000 --> 03:17:54,680
All right, get over here.

5413
03:17:55,180 --> 03:17:55,820
Work.

5414
03:17:56,760 --> 03:18:01,180
I can I can literally enhance.

5415
03:18:01,800 --> 03:18:02,740
All right.

5416
03:18:02,740 --> 03:18:03,060
Yeah.

5417
03:18:06,160 --> 03:18:06,800
Work.

5418
03:18:11,800 --> 03:18:16,160
Oh, it only took three hours.

5419
03:18:17,560 --> 03:18:18,920
They only took 30 hours.

5420
03:18:18,920 --> 03:18:22,000
It only took three hours to get there, but we made it.

5421
03:18:22,360 --> 03:18:23,400
but we made it.

5422
03:18:23,400 --> 03:18:24,480
We made it.

5423
03:18:26,200 --> 03:18:28,460
All right, this is it.

5424
03:18:29,820 --> 03:18:30,680
Oh my God.

5425
03:18:30,720 --> 03:18:33,520
We actually actually let's put the others.

5426
03:18:33,760 --> 03:18:34,240
We made it.

5427
03:18:34,240 --> 03:18:35,340
Oh, what do I need?

5428
03:18:35,560 --> 03:18:36,360
Oh yeah.

5429
03:18:36,480 --> 03:18:36,740
Yeah.

5430
03:18:36,920 --> 03:18:38,300
There was something I need to build.

5431
03:18:38,460 --> 03:18:38,920
Hmm.

5432
03:18:43,160 --> 03:18:44,040

Don't forget to What was that?

5435
03:18:50,720 --> 03:18:53,160
My most important thing.

5436
03:18:53,160 --> 03:18:55,620
My most important thing in this world.

5437
03:19:06,120 --> 03:19:06,800
Goon goon.

5438

Oh yeah, you're right.

5440
03:19:20,040 --> 03:19:21,500
No, you guys are more creative.

5441
03:19:27,740 --> 03:19:28,460
You're right.

5442
03:19:28,980 --> 03:19:30,380
How could I forget?

5443
03:19:34,900 --> 03:19:37,300
Also known as sound guy.

5444
03:19:39,860 --> 03:19:40,700
There we go.

5445
03:19:41,620 --> 03:19:42,420

How's the sound, sound guy?

5448
03:19:50,540 --> 03:19:52,080
This is where I keep my mods.

5449
03:19:52,340 --> 03:19:52,640
Yes.

5450
03:19:53,260 --> 03:19:54,740
I keep my mods right here.

5451
03:19:55,700 --> 03:19:56,360
That's right.

5452
03:19:57,680 --> 03:19:59,380
This is where the sound guy lies.

5453
03:19:59,860 --> 03:20:00,500
Alright.

5454
03:20:00,600 --> 03:20:02,080
I feel like I need a...

5455
03:20:04,760 --> 03:20:06,040
Night goon.

5456
03:20:06,540 --> 03:20:08,060
And then...

5457
03:20:11,160 --> 03:20:12,380
Wolf goon.

5458
03:20:12,620 --> 03:20:13,540
There you go.

5459
03:20:17,680 --> 03:20:18,320
Alright.

5460
03:20:18,520 --> 03:20:19,280
It's time.

5461
03:20:20,340 --> 03:20:22,200
Oh my god, it's finally time.

5462
03:20:23,740 --> 03:20:25,280
It's finally time.

5463
03:20:27,300 --> 03:20:28,620
Get over here.

5464
03:20:30,500 --> 03:20:31,020
Finally.

5465
03:20:31,260 --> 03:20:32,140
Okay guys.

5466
03:20:32,300 --> 03:20:32,860
I need...

5467
03:20:32,860 --> 03:20:33,740
How do I get there?

5468
03:20:34,260 --> 03:20:35,000
How do I...

5469
03:20:35,000 --> 03:20:36,820
Guys, let me look at the map.

5470
03:20:37,040 --> 03:20:37,900
Guys, let me...

5471
03:20:37,900 --> 03:20:40,140
Let me look at...

5472
03:20:40,140 --> 03:20:41,260
Let me...

5473
03:20:41,260 --> 03:20:43,420
Give me a sec.

5474
03:20:43,620 --> 03:20:45,240
I need to look at the map.

5475
03:20:46,660 --> 03:20:48,200
Hiro sent me the map.

5476
03:20:48,380 --> 03:20:48,640
Okay.

5477
03:20:48,800 --> 03:20:49,500
Oh, okay.

5478
03:20:49,560 --> 03:20:50,960
It's all the way over there.

5479
03:20:51,200 --> 03:20:51,720
Alright.

5480
03:20:52,080 --> 03:20:52,860
Don't worry.

5481
03:20:53,920 --> 03:20:55,920
We're gonna head over...

5482
03:20:55,920 --> 03:20:56,960
Tidal dance over there.

5483
03:20:56,960 --> 03:20:57,640
Do you see it?

5484
03:20:58,260 --> 03:20:59,040
It's over there.

5485
03:21:01,260 --> 03:21:02,600
It's right over there.

5486
03:21:04,060 --> 03:21:05,060
Do you see it?

5487
03:21:06,080 --> 03:21:06,480
Wait.

5488
03:21:06,520 --> 03:21:07,780
Actually, I don't know if it is over there.

5489
03:21:07,780 --> 03:21:08,100
Is that it?

5490
03:21:09,140 --> 03:21:09,900
Is that it?

5491
03:21:10,780 --> 03:21:11,180
Okay.

5492
03:21:11,280 --> 03:21:11,460
Okay.

5493
03:21:11,720 --> 03:21:12,660
Give me a sec.

5494
03:21:12,740 --> 03:21:13,200
Is that it?

5495
03:21:13,460 --> 03:21:13,960
Is that it?

5496
03:21:14,240 --> 03:21:14,640
Okay.

5497
03:21:18,060 --> 03:21:19,480
I think it's over here.

5498
03:21:25,380 --> 03:21:26,620
Maybe it's here.

5499
03:21:27,640 --> 03:21:29,280
I'll figure this out, guys.

5500
03:21:29,740 --> 03:21:30,980
It's somewhere...

5501
03:21:30,980 --> 03:21:31,760
Okay.

5502
03:21:32,360 --> 03:21:33,020
It's like...

5503
03:21:33,020 --> 03:21:33,980
Is that it?

5504
03:21:35,140 --> 03:21:36,280
Where is it?

5505
03:21:36,340 --> 03:21:37,580
Hiro literally sent me a map.

5506
03:21:37,800 --> 03:21:39,080
Where the fuck is that?

5507
03:21:39,560 --> 03:21:40,640
No, it's like here.

5508
03:21:41,920 --> 03:21:42,880
It's like...

5509
03:21:44,380 --> 03:21:45,300
We're not lost.

5510
03:21:45,460 --> 03:21:46,900
We're gonna find the oil.

5511
03:21:47,120 --> 03:21:50,540
This is the most important place we have to go.

5512
03:21:51,900 --> 03:21:53,440
Like, it's somewhere here.

5513
03:21:54,440 --> 03:21:55,240
Is that it?

5514
03:21:55,420 --> 03:21:55,580
Okay.

5515
03:21:55,760 --> 03:21:55,980
I think I'm gonna go.

5516
03:21:56,200 --> 03:21:58,040
What is this circle that I'm seeing?

5517
03:21:58,500 --> 03:21:59,080
Okay.

5518
03:21:59,140 --> 03:22:00,680
It's like this general area.

5519
03:22:03,560 --> 03:22:06,760
I was told it was this general area.

5520
03:22:06,940 --> 03:22:07,320
Okay.

5521
03:22:08,220 --> 03:22:09,040
Is that...

5522
03:22:09,040 --> 03:22:09,800
No.

5523
03:22:09,840 --> 03:22:10,920
There's no oil rigs here.

5524
03:22:11,920 --> 03:22:13,880
Where the fuck is the oil rig?

5525
03:22:16,930 --> 03:22:18,060
That's not the oil rig.

5526
03:22:18,100 --> 03:22:18,760
That's the island.

5527
03:22:19,760 --> 03:22:20,720
That's the...

5528
03:22:22,600 --> 03:22:23,980
That's the fucking island.

5529
03:22:24,800 --> 03:22:26,180
Where the fuck is the oil rig?

5530
03:22:26,180 --> 03:22:26,780
Where the fuck is this oil rig?

5531
03:22:28,540 --> 03:22:29,140
Oh.

5532
03:22:29,280 --> 03:22:29,720
Wait.

5533
03:22:29,780 --> 03:22:30,660
I think it's like here.

5534
03:22:31,080 --> 03:22:32,360
Oh, shit.

5535
03:22:33,360 --> 03:22:35,400
I can't read the map.

5536
03:22:35,760 --> 03:22:36,520
No, it's not.

5537
03:22:36,740 --> 03:22:37,680
It's like...

5538
03:22:37,680 --> 03:22:42,920
For some reason, the oil rig is on the opposite side of everything.

5539
03:22:44,500 --> 03:22:45,460
It's like...

5540
03:22:45,460 --> 03:22:51,900
The Sakura Aijima is like over there, but the oil rig is over here.

5541
03:22:52,620 --> 03:22:53,220
Okay.

5542
03:22:53,320 --> 03:22:53,960
Marsh Islands.

5543
03:22:54,100 --> 03:22:54,280
Okay.

5544
03:22:54,340 --> 03:22:54,760
We're close.

5545
03:22:56,180 --> 03:22:56,220
Yes.

5546
03:22:56,220 --> 03:22:56,760
Because I remembered.

5547
03:22:56,960 --> 03:22:58,600
I remember the instructions.

5548
03:22:59,020 --> 03:23:00,960
It was next to Marsh Islands.

5549
03:23:01,860 --> 03:23:02,980
I remember...

5550
03:23:02,980 --> 03:23:04,340
I know my instructions...

5551
03:23:05,420 --> 03:23:06,360
I think.

5552
03:23:06,480 --> 03:23:06,920
Okay.

5553
03:23:06,980 --> 03:23:09,480
It's like in this general area.

5554
03:23:12,820 --> 03:23:14,220
Is that it?

5555
03:23:14,460 --> 03:23:15,480
Guys, do you see that?

5556
03:23:15,840 --> 03:23:17,720
That has to be the oil rig.

5557
03:23:18,360 --> 03:23:19,560
Do you see that?

5558
03:23:19,560 --> 03:23:20,780
That pool in the distance?

5559
03:23:21,500 --> 03:23:25,070
I think it is.

5560
03:23:26,050 --> 03:23:27,650
Why is there a pool there?

5561
03:23:27,870 --> 03:23:28,390
I think there is.

5562
03:23:31,590 --> 03:23:33,250
Guys, we need our oil!

5563
03:23:33,750 --> 03:23:35,470
We need our oil!

5564
03:23:36,930 --> 03:23:37,370
Guys,

5565
03:23:40,680 --> 03:23:41,380
I think this is it.

5566
03:23:44,620 --> 03:23:45,060
Guys!

5567
03:23:45,060 --> 03:23:46,360
Guys, I think this is it!

5568
03:23:46,360 --> 03:23:47,320
This is the oil rig!

5569
03:23:47,880 --> 03:23:48,320
Guys!

5570
03:23:50,200 --> 03:23:50,640
Guys!

5571
03:23:50,640 --> 03:23:51,700
We're at the oil rig!

5572
03:23:58,350 --> 03:23:58,790
Guys!

5573
03:23:58,790 --> 03:24:00,090
Guys, it's July 4th!

5574
03:24:00,130 --> 03:24:00,570
Guys!

5575
03:24:03,390 --> 03:24:04,590
Oh my god!

5576
03:24:05,790 --> 03:24:07,770
It's finally July 4th!

5577
03:24:09,990 --> 03:24:12,150
The oil rig is real!

5578
03:24:23,300 --> 03:24:24,800
Guys, I think I'm dead.

5579
03:24:25,040 --> 03:24:25,620
No!

5580
03:24:25,820 --> 03:24:26,580
No!

5581
03:24:28,780 --> 03:24:29,540
No!

5582
03:24:30,560 --> 03:24:30,740
No!

5583
03:24:34,940 --> 03:24:36,080
My items!

5584
03:24:37,760 --> 03:24:40,140
What the fuck was that?!

5585
03:24:42,920 --> 03:24:43,960
What the fuck?!

5586
03:24:43,960 --> 03:24:45,240
They have Tepris?!

5587
03:24:46,000 --> 03:24:48,240
What the fuck?!

5588
03:24:49,020 --> 03:24:53,500
Since when did they have Tepris?!

5589
03:24:54,240 --> 03:24:56,360
I can't get on the wolf!

5590
03:24:57,840 --> 03:24:59,520
I can't get on the wolf!

5591
03:25:04,150 --> 03:25:07,230
They have anti-air?!

5592
03:25:08,430 --> 03:25:10,450
Since when?!

5593
03:25:11,910 --> 03:25:13,410
When did they have anti-air?!

5594
03:25:13,430 --> 03:25:14,350
They came to get my oil rigs!

5595
03:25:14,350 --> 03:25:14,890
I'm dead!

5596
03:25:15,010 --> 03:25:16,210
I'm dead!

5597
03:25:16,450 --> 03:25:16,850
Guys!

5598
03:25:17,130 --> 03:25:17,350
No!

5599
03:25:17,650 --> 03:25:18,770
We're so close!

5600
03:25:19,310 --> 03:25:21,210
We're so close!

5601
03:25:22,310 --> 03:25:23,010
Please!

5602
03:25:23,150 --> 03:25:24,630
Please, we're just there!

5603
03:25:25,070 --> 03:25:25,730
Please, no!

5604
03:25:26,050 --> 03:25:26,890
No!

5605
03:25:36,440 --> 03:25:39,340
Oh my god...

5606
03:25:41,860 --> 03:25:42,280
Well...

5607
03:25:42,280 --> 03:25:44,360
That was...

5608
03:25:44,360 --> 03:25:49,040
What a fun adventure we had together.

5609
03:25:49,940 --> 03:25:55,260
Guys, well, that was so fun everybody.

5610
03:25:56,320 --> 03:25:57,440
Wow!

5611
03:25:57,980 --> 03:26:07,960
We had such a fun time, guys!

5612
03:26:11,640 --> 03:26:17,280
This is the first time I have worn an oil ring.

5613
03:26:17,780 --> 03:26:20,080
I was not worn a...

5614
03:26:22,020 --> 03:26:25,000
Nobody worn me.

5615
03:26:28,460 --> 03:26:34,720
I just wanted to go to the oil ring.

5616
03:26:35,020 --> 03:26:37,360
I saw Sakurajima.

5617
03:26:37,720 --> 03:26:39,880
I just wanted to see the oil ring.

5618
03:26:39,900 --> 03:26:43,560
I can't believe there was death rays.

5619
03:26:43,880 --> 03:26:45,180
That was crazy.

5620
03:26:45,580 --> 03:26:46,520
Oh my god.

5621
03:26:47,820 --> 03:26:49,980
Why was there death rays?

5622
03:26:50,280 --> 03:26:50,980
Why?

5623
03:26:51,620 --> 03:26:54,860
I need to take off my jacket after that.

5624
03:26:55,220 --> 03:26:56,920
Oh my god.

5625
03:26:57,220 --> 03:26:58,900
I can't believe...

5626
03:27:02,420 --> 03:27:04,160
Oh my god.

5627
03:27:04,240 --> 03:27:07,320
I can't believe there was oil.

5628
03:27:07,420 --> 03:27:09,060
There was a death ray.

5629
03:27:09,200 --> 03:27:09,880
To put oil on my face.

5630
03:27:09,900 --> 03:27:11,840
To protect the oil, of course.

5631
03:27:12,440 --> 03:27:13,080
Oh...

5632
03:27:13,800 --> 03:27:15,320
I can't believe it.

5633
03:27:15,420 --> 03:27:16,100
I just...

5634
03:27:16,880 --> 03:27:18,160
They do...

5635
03:27:18,160 --> 03:27:19,820
They heard...

5636
03:27:19,820 --> 03:27:21,240
They were like the American...

5637
03:27:21,680 --> 03:27:26,140
The Canadian cowboy trying to role play as the American is coming.

5638
03:27:31,120 --> 03:27:32,440
Oh my god.

5639
03:27:32,540 --> 03:27:33,360
I just...

5640
03:27:33,700 --> 03:27:35,300
I wasn't gonna take the oil.

5641
03:27:35,720 --> 03:27:36,780
I swear.

5642
03:27:37,060 --> 03:27:38,320
I wasn't gonna...

5643
03:27:38,320 --> 03:27:41,480
I wasn't gonna go for the American and take the oil.

5644
03:27:41,480 --> 03:27:43,760
I just wanna see the oil.

5645
03:27:44,060 --> 03:27:44,600
I swear.

5646
03:27:45,480 --> 03:27:46,060
I just...

5647
03:27:46,060 --> 03:27:48,660
I just wanted to see the oil.

5648
03:27:48,940 --> 03:27:50,720
Is that too much to ask for?

5649
03:27:51,360 --> 03:27:52,200
Is that...

5650
03:27:52,200 --> 03:27:54,120
Is that really too much?

5651
03:27:54,440 --> 03:27:55,740
I had a fun time though.

5652
03:27:57,600 --> 03:27:59,160
I had a...

5653
03:27:59,160 --> 03:28:02,160
I hope you guys had a really fun time watching too.

5654
03:28:02,280 --> 03:28:02,980
It was a lot.

5655
03:28:03,040 --> 03:28:05,140
We had a lot going on today.

5656
03:28:05,620 --> 03:28:07,920
We streamed for like almost three...

5657
03:28:07,920 --> 03:28:09,600
We streamed like three and a half hours.

5658
03:28:09,640 --> 03:28:10,220
I was like...

5659
03:28:10,220 --> 03:28:14,800
I didn't expect to stream that long today, but I was having a lot of fun with you guys.

5660
03:28:16,380 --> 03:28:18,740
Guys, I'm gonna... I'm tired.

5661
03:28:21,900 --> 03:28:28,560
But we have... we have so much stuff to look forward to in the coming week.

5662
03:28:28,780 --> 03:28:33,280
If you guys don't follow me on Twitter, I am taking a chill...

5663
03:28:33,280 --> 03:28:35,980
I'm gonna chill for the next two weeks.

5664
03:28:39,800 --> 03:28:45,240
Because... because... I'm... I've been working, working full speed.

5665
03:28:45,420 --> 03:28:46,340
Gas, gas, gas.

5666
03:28:46,660 --> 03:28:51,360
For half... like, you know, five to six... five to six months now.

5667
03:28:52,160 --> 03:28:55,620
It's time to release the gas and slow down.

5668
03:28:55,940 --> 03:28:59,300
It's time to press on the brakes a little and slow down a little.

5669
03:28:59,380 --> 03:29:00,340
It's yellow light time.

5670
03:29:01,900 --> 03:29:04,540
So that's why we are...

5671
03:29:05,120 --> 03:29:05,960
We're gonna release the gas.

5672
03:29:05,980 --> 03:29:06,760
Relax a little bit.

5673
03:29:06,880 --> 03:29:10,300
I wanna cool down after an intense debut.

5674
03:29:12,260 --> 03:29:12,780
Debut.

5675
03:29:13,040 --> 03:29:16,120
And it was... it's been a fun time today, dragons.

5676
03:29:16,240 --> 03:29:17,000
I hope you guys...

5677
03:29:18,360 --> 03:29:19,760
Enjoy the new skin suit.

5678
03:29:20,520 --> 03:29:24,500
Thank you all for the super chats and the ships and everything, guys.

5679
03:29:24,780 --> 03:29:26,600
I'm telling you guys to know we're slowly...

5680
03:29:26,600 --> 03:29:29,720
The changing of graphics, because I know I'm still using my old icons.

5681
03:29:30,020 --> 03:29:31,780
And my old headers and everything.

5682
03:29:32,920 --> 03:29:35,120
I'm very, very, very slowly changing.

5683
03:29:35,120 --> 03:29:37,080
My graphics for stuff.

5684
03:29:37,340 --> 03:29:39,040
And also, I'm tired.

5685
03:29:40,880 --> 03:29:49,340
I know I haven't posted the wallpapers or the 3D models or the changing icons and everything to match my new skin suit.

5686
03:29:49,540 --> 03:29:50,680
I'm just tired.

5687
03:29:51,080 --> 03:29:54,540
It's gonna slowly change one by one.

5688
03:29:54,800 --> 03:29:57,620
And then it's gonna get there, okay?

5689
03:29:59,400 --> 03:30:02,280
We're slowly, slowly getting there.

5690
03:30:02,520 --> 03:30:04,540
Anyway, as always, everybody...

5691
03:30:04,540 --> 03:30:05,580
Stay hydrated.

5692
03:30:06,260 --> 03:30:06,900
Posture check.

5693
03:30:07,020 --> 03:30:08,600
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

5694
03:30:08,800 --> 03:30:10,520
And if you stay up for me...

5695
03:30:10,520 --> 03:30:11,300
Head to bed.

5696
03:30:11,540 --> 03:30:12,880
Because you deserve it.

5697
03:30:13,020 --> 03:30:13,940
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

5698
03:30:14,420 --> 03:30:15,160
Bye, guys.

5699
03:30:16,380 --> 03:30:16,820
Bye.

5700
03:30:25,350 --> 03:30:26,770
Also, buy my merch.

5701
03:30:27,130 --> 03:30:27,990
Buy my merch.

5702
03:30:28,290 --> 03:30:29,210
It's gonna be a diorama.

5703
03:30:29,490 --> 03:30:33,870
I know it doesn't say that, but we decided last minute to make it into a diorama acrylic stand for the...

5704
03:30:33,870 --> 03:30:35,310
So the background will be that...

5705
03:30:35,990 --> 03:30:36,930
Yippee-ki-yay.

5706
03:30:37,290 --> 03:30:39,650
Cliff background on the acrylic stand.

5707
03:30:39,830 --> 03:30:40,110
Buy my merch.

5708
03:30:40,130 --> 03:30:40,490
Buy my merch.

5709
03:30:43,170 --> 03:30:43,730
Bye.

5710
03:31:01,010 --> 03:31:02,350
Sorry, Dokimerch.com.
