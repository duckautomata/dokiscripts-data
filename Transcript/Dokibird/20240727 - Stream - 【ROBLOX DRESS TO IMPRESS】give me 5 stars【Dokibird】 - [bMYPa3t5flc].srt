1
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:53,630
Guys... guys... messed up.

2
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:05,570
You must be wondering, wow, Doki, you sound very dead inside.

3
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,130
Very, very good observation.

4
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,410
Because I am.

5
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,110
Okay, guys.

6
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:38,330
Okay, so, you know... you know how our goal... one of our goals is to end in a...

7
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,850
Oh, my fashion... what?

8
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,670
Wait, what?

9
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,950
Okay, alright, we're not starting yet.

10
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,110
I'm just chilling.

11
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,950
Wait, am I gonna be like in there already?

12
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,370
And then people are gonna be like, wow, she didn't even try.

13
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,330
I didn't know the game started.

14
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,830
You know what, let's just watch the fashion show.

15
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,230
While I talk about...

16
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,210
Okay, total new lobby.

17
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,610
What the fuck?

18
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,590
Thank you for one billion... there's enough children for one billion visits?

19
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,410
Decorate a free section?

20
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:13,850
Oh, that's me.

21
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,410
That's me.

22
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:15,970
That's me.

23
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:16,690
Alright.

24
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:17,630
Anyway.

25
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,650
The game's graphics have been changed.

26
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,750
If your graphics are in a high level and experience...

27
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,910
Okay, I am a... I'm not a child.

28
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,630
Okay, I have... I am an adult.

29
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,090
With my own credit card.

30
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,490
I'm ready to be...

31
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,510
Why would this lag?

32
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,350
It's literally a fashion show.

33
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,830
Why would this be laggy?

34
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,830
Hey!

35
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,350
It's literally Brad's dolls.

36
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,890
With fucking clothes.

37
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,850
Okay, it'll be funny if I'm actually in here.

38
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:50,930
Um...

39
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,050
But like...

40
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:52,350
Anyway...

41
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,170
So, holy shit!

42
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,130
Look at her go!

43
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,370
Okay, maybe I'll be way too distracted if I...

44
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:58,850
Okay, guys.

45
00:03:58,930 --> 00:03:59,530
I'm gonna...

46
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,310
I'm gonna close this.

47
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,110
I'm definitely gonna be way too distracted.

48
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:09,050
Okay.

49
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:09,850
Alright.

50
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,990
I have to close it.

51
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,850
Because I'm gonna be too...

52
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,330
I can't finish my story if I look at this.

53
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,250
It's a fashion show.

54
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,070
Okay.

55
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,390
Um...

56
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,630
Um, as I was saying...

57
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,470
So, okay.

58
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,250
So, one of my goals is that I wanna end...

59
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,870
I wanna end Top 500 in Overwatch.

60
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,410
I'm back.

61
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,010
It's back.

62
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:36,790
It's back.

63
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,950
You know, like...

64
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:41,030
Whenever you're in the very...

65
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,610
Whenever you're...

66
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,630
You're like...

67
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,910
I'll never come back.

68
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,370
And then the game was like...

69
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,190
No, you'll always come back, Doki.

70
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:56,050
You know I'm the only one that loves you, Doki.

71
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,230
You know you could never leave.

72
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,370
So, it's like a very...

73
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,290
You know...

74
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,990
A very abusive relationship with this game.

75
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,590
And I'll be like...

76
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,590
No, I will never...

77
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,530
No, I won't.

78
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,810
I got help this time.

79
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,750
I'll never come back to you.

80
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,050
And then later on, you're just like...

81
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,190
Oh, but like...

82
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,210
He's changed, guys.

83
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,070
It's like fun now.

84
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,590
I swear.

85
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,150
I swear, Dragoons.

86
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,470
It's actually fun now, guys.

87
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,890
And then everybody else around me is like...

88
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:25,550
No, Doki, please.

89
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,890
Please, you have to finally leave.

90
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,930
Is he...

91
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,670
No, but you don't understand.

92
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,270
Dragoons, I can...

93
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,930
I can fix it.

94
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,110
Guys, no.

95
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:37,870
It wasn't...

96
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,410
He...

97
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,030
He wasn't the issue.

98
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,670
I was the issue.

99
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:46,930
I was the issue, guys.

100
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:48,990
Anyway.

101
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,890
So I...

102
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,810
I'm back on it.

103
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,290
I'm back on it.

104
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,350
And...

105
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,070
And...

106
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:05,490
Basically, I played Overwatch for...

107
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,110
For a long time.

108
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,590
After...

109
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,050
After...

110
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,430
Because like today, yesterday...

111
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,930
I had to...

112
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:30,330
I know I left Overwatch several times, but this time for real, they're bringing 6v6 back, chat.

113
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:36,670
They're bringing 6v6 back, guys.

114
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,050
He's going back to his roots.

115
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,650
I have to be there for Overwatch.

116
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,070
You know?

117
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,890
Okay, anyway.

118
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,990
It's different this time.

119
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,170
They're bringing 6v6!

120
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,570
They're bringing back Overwatch 1!

121
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,570
You don't understand!

122
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:05,490
Bro, Overwatch 1 with fucking the tanks that they have now?

123
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,030
Oh my god, I'm like thinking Zarya, Mogg, and...

124
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,230
...Mogg is gonna be fucking insane.

125
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:17,650
Like, Zarya with any of the tanks that we have currently.

126
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,870
And we're doing 6v6... Oh no, we're gonna bring back GOATS.

127
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:25,390
No, we're gonna bring back GOATS!

128
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:28,930
No!

129
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,250
Nevermind.

130
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,830
No, GOATS!

131
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,450
Sorry, that's...

132
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,730
The pain was so real in that.

133
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:44,770
I just... I forgot about GOATS.

134
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:48,270
People were like, what the fuck is she talking about?

135
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,250
A GOAT?

136
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,130
No, it's like, it's specific.

137
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:56,210
Okay, for those who don't play Overwatch, it is actually like...

138
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,830
It's a very specific comp.

139
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,750
Where it's 3 tanks and 3 supports.

140
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,930
And, like, they don't die.

141
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,390
Nobody dies.

142
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,350
And...

143
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,910
And GOATS was fucking terrible.

144
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:18,410
Because it's literally every fucking game in high elo.

145
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:23,370
Because if you're fucking desperate enough, you'd be like, please guys, this is my top 500 game.

146
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,370
Please, can we go GOATS?

147
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,590
Can we please go GOATS?

148
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:31,090
And... and the reason why people really, really fucking hated that...

149
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:35,730
That, like, particular meta, that comp with 3 tanks, 3 supports.

150
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,170
Is that...

151
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,850
Is that, basically...

152
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,590
It's an alt battle.

153
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,790
It's whoever fucks up the alt first.

154
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,970
Because everybody just farms alt.

155
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,710
And then... and then it's whoever fucks up alt.

156
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:56,490
Whoever fucks up their ultimate loses the team fight.

157
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,970
And it's so fucking frustrating.

158
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,130
At least we have... at least we have role queue.

159
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,010
So there's no way... there's no way!

160
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,710
There's no way GOATS!

161
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,410
GOATS will be back!

162
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,730
We'll just have 2 really fucking stupid overpowered tanks this time!

163
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:15,030
We'll just have incredibly overpowered tanks.

164
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,770
And it's just going to be 2 of them.

165
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:24,690
No!

166
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,670
If they can't physically bring back GOATS!

167
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:28,750
Because it's...

168
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,650
Dude, dude, dude!

169
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,330
DPS is just going to be a worthless role!

170
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:37,410
But when have they been worth anything in the last 2 years?

171
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:38,530
Like...

172
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:44,470
All the DPS players left to play other games where they can actually shoot their gun.

173
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:45,990
So it doesn't matter.

174
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,190
It doesn't matter.

175
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,710
Oh my god.

176
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:53,490
Anyway...

177
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,030
So... I have a problem right now.

178
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,690
That's been happening for like a while.

179
00:09:59,090 --> 00:09:59,830
For...

180
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,360
For like a... um...

181
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,230
I have a problem.

182
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,630
And that's why I'm dead inside at the moment.

183
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,790
Because I did not sleep much today.

184
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,050
Because I was like...

185
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:12,790
After the...

186
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,770
After the panel in Singapore...

187
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:16,970
I fucking...

188
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:17,850
I...

189
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,750
I went and played Overwatch.

190
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,090
But...

191
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,450
Yes...

192
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,990
I took Q today.

193
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,250
I took Q last night.

194
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,090
Guys...

195
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,370
For those who don't know...

196
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,890
What it means...

197
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,050
To take Q in Overwatch...

198
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:43,250
I had my longest lost streak...

199
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:44,970
Since...

200
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,470
I had the longest lost streak...

201
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,010
That I ever had...

202
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,190
In a very long time.

203
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,450
And then you know you're like...

204
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,530
I can't stop until I break the lost streak.

205
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,790
I can't stop until I break the lost streak guys.

206
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:07,390
Or...

207
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:08,370
So...

208
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,770
I was...

209
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,450
Masters 2.

210
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,610
And then...

211
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,470
And then I took Q...

212
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,870
To Masters 4.

213
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,610
And I'm at the...

214
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,130
And I am at the bottom run of Masters 4.

215
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:32,670
Like I'm nearly one game away from losing Masters 4.

216
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,750
For those who don't understand...

217
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,870
How bad it is to...

218
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,810
To lose that much...

219
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,970
Masters 2...

220
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,650
Masters 1...

221
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,550
Is top 500.

222
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:52,270
And not just top 500.

223
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,350
It's rank 300 to 500.

224
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,730
That's Masters 1.

225
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,110
And I was Masters 2.

226
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,530
I was...

227
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,410
So close.

228
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,430
I was so close!

229
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,590
But yeah.

230
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,010
That's why...

231
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,270
Now I'm that guy that went from...

232
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:15,350

Okay, so for those who don't know, either of those people...

Oh my god!

314
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,010
I need to grab money, because I'm poor!

315
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,050
This is so fucked up!

316
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,070
Queen of Hearts?

317
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,230

Um... no, I have to be red- No, oh, oh wait!

320
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,110

This works, guys.

322
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:52,210
This works.

323
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:56,690
And then we gotta grab some money because we're fucking broke as hell.

324
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:05,630
Alright, so every generation, we need a streamer that likes to...

325
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,370
Okay, we gotta do hair.

326
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,150
Sorry, give me a sec.

327
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,770
Oh, this one.

328
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:09,250
Okay.

329
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,410
That has to be!

330
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:12,950
That's bangs?

331
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:13,850
Do we need bangs?

332
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,210
That's Queen of Hearts material!

333
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,650
And then... oh...

334
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:20,590
Okay, no, I can't!

335
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,510
I can't do like...

336
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,370
Two double colors.

337
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,330
God damn it, I can't do double colors!

338
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,370
I have to get rid of it.

339
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:27,730
Okay.

340
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,370
Alright, how do I get out of the chair?

341
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,090
How do I get out of the chair?

342
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,030
I finished it.

343
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,130
How do I get out of the chair?

344
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,730
HOW DO I GET OUT OF THE CHAAAA- Okay, okay.

345
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:38,570
I don't do well under time limit, guys.

346
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,970
I don't know if you noticed, but I don't do well when I'm...

347
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,150
No, I'm not!

348
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,970
I'm not in the prank!

349
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,530
Oh no.

350
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,090
No, I got the hair though!

351
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,230
I got the hair!

352
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,910
There's so- Oh, how did she get that?

353
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,050
Wait, I'm gonna copy your clothes.

354
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,290
Wait, a thousand dollars?

355
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:03,530
I'm not that rich in Roblox money!

356
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,190
I'm gonna put a cellphone though.

357
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:06,550
Oh...

358
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:11,310
Cause Queen of Hearts is a fucking boss bitch.

359
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:18,630
And she's ready to- Oh, this doesn't need- Okay, this is bullshit that this doesn't need.

360
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,090
Uh, this doesn't need money.

361
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:22,390
Wait, what do I wear?

362
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,710
What can I afford?

363
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,490
What can I- Oh, okay, maybe I can afford this.

364
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:28,930
Okay, uh, patterns.

365
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,510
Do I have any heart patterns?

366
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,030
I- I- Oh my gosh.

367
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:33,870
Okay, I have three minutes.

368
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:37,310
Uh, the most ugliest part!

369
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,330
What a statement of society.

370
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:41,710
Right there.

371
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,070
Damn!

372
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,670
This is a fucking statement.

373
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,690
No, I need a shirt, guys!

374
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,550
Oh my- Okay, I still have three minutes, guys.

375
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:54,450
I still have three minutes.

376
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:57,630
I think I look pretty fucking good, not gonna lie.

377
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,250
I- I think I look really good.

378
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,490
Alright, no, not the men clothing.

379
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,310
It says Queen of Hearts.

380
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,830
Where the fuck- I need a shirt!

381
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,010
We live in a society.

382
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,350
No, what is this?

383
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,190
No, I'm excluded!

384
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,840
This is the poor!

385
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,320
The poor!

386
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:22,760
Come on,

387
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:31,770
we're in the poor section!

388
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,570
No!

389
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,550
Society wins!

390
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,990
No, don't recognize it!

391
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,250
They've been playing Dressed in Frisk for 20 years!

392
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:46,930
They know what the poor section looks like!

393
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,170
I'm back.

394
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:56,310
I- I- How about blue screen?

395
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,650
It's ROBLOX!

396
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:11,610
How the fuck- How the fuck am I- Alright, guys, I'm gonna- I'm gonna get rid of this Intel card.

397
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:12,730
I think it's Intel.

398
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,910
It's always- I think it's Intel.

399
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,110
Alright.

400
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:20,790
I think- Oh my god!

401
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:26,310
I actually got kicked out of- I was so- I was- I was panicking.

402
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:31,450
I was- I was panicking about the Queen of Hearts.

403
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:37,590
And then- and then I- and then- and then they kicked me out.

404
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,430
They kicked me- I couldn't even fit!

405
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,320
Okay, I think I know why, guys.

406
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,720
I think I might know why.

407
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,960
It could be- okay, I think I fucked up.

408
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:59,660
By down- underclocking my PC for Marvel Rivals.

409
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,640
So, cause like, I think that's what did it.

410
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,920
I think that's what happened!

411
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,160
I don't know- I wonder if I could like, fix it, like, manually.

412
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:19,340
But, basically, um, I underclocked, uh, I underclocked my PC cause it was recommended by the game.

413
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,020
Um, to- to underclock it.

414
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:26,680
To, uh, to- to like- To like, 53X.

415
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,580
And, yeah, I undervault- yeah, I undervaulted.

416
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,460
Because, like, Marvel Rivals would not boot up.

417
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,680
And then Marvel Rivals has like a recommendation.

418
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,380
Um, that was like, we can't run this game on Intel 13.

419
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,680
So, it- you have to under- undervault it.

420
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,580
Sorry, I meant- yeah, I undervaulted, guys.

421
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,260
But then I revaulted it after the stream.

422
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,740
So, like, I- I undid the undervault.

423
00:21:53,100 --> 00:22:00,880
And, uh- I- I- it was recommended by the game.

424
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,080
So, I did that.

425
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:10,060
And, uh- And- and I think after that, that's when the blue screen happened.

426
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,540
So, um...

427
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:21,900
Do I- just- yeah- yeah, so, like, I think that's what happened.

428
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:32,460
Because the game- Marvel Rivals- Cannot run- um- cannot run, uh- The game- you cannot run the- the game will crash, basically.

429
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,980
The game will crash if, uh...

430
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,460
Uh...

431
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,060
I grilled my CPU?

432
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,780
Did I actually did that?

433
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,100
I did one stream!

434
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,800
I did one fucking stream!

435
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,300
Oh my god!

436
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,800
I did one stream and my CPU is...

437
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,240
It's already fucked!

438
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:57,780
What?!

439
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,240
Oh my god!

440
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,980
But I redid it!

441
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,900
I- I- I didn't play Marvel Rivals for that long!

442
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,480
Like...

443
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,560
There's no way!

444
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,020
Do I- do I keep it undervaulted?

445
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,940
Do I actually keep it undervaulted for- until- I don't know!

446
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,640
Oh my god!

447
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,560
Bro...

448
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,380
It's not-

449
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,400
Yeah...

450
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,640
Yeah, basically...

451
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:31,700
Uh...

452
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,280
Yeah?

453
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,640
Okay, I'll keep it...

454
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,060
Uh...

455
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:35,940
I'll- it could help.

456
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,180
Okay, I'll keep- I'll keep it undervaulted then.

457
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,780
I had it, like...

458
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,520
Uh...

459
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:46,660
Because, like, now I- after the Marvel Rivals stream, I re- I did it back to- I did it...

460
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,620
Um...

461
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,220
I did it back to...

462
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:49,780
Uh...

463
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,760
To the original.

464
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:51,900
Um...

465
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,720
But then, like...

466
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,480
Then I started- then the- the blue screen started happening...

467
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,800
For the stream.

468
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,620
I think that's what hap- I think that's what happened to PC-kun too!

469
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,140
That's- I think...

470
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,760
I'm pretty sure...

471
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,700
I'm pretty sure that's also what happened to- Okay, I...

472
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,820
I changed the performance core ratio.

473
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,740
I'm gonna go back to 53 then.

474
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,160
Okay.

475
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,100
I'm gonna try and put an AMD...

476
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,680
I'm gonna do that on the weekend.

477
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:22,880
Um...

478
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,280
Because, like, you know, there's- there's so much stuff going on.

479
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,340
I hate it!

480
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:27,580
I hate it!

481
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,460
Alright!

482
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:29,640
I...

483
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,040
I undervaulted!

484
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,660
I undervaulted it again.

485
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,520
So...

486
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,180
Um...

487
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,620
We'll see if this works.

488
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,240
I- I forced the undervault.

489
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:38,460
Alright.

490
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,160
This is the weekend.

491
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,000
I...

492
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,960
There's a lot going on.

493
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,960
Guys, I- Never!

494
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,860
Thank you for the five gifted chips!

495
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:48,460
Thank you!

496
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,080
Thank you!

497
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,880
Oh, no...

498
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,800
I need it.

499
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,040
I need it.

500
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,000
This PC is so heavy!

501
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,060
Oh, my God!

502
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,100
And an AMD motherboard!

503
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,820
Oh...

504
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,700
Alright.

505
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,380
Anyway, I guess I'll- I'll look into that tomorrow.

506
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:26,800
I'll look in- I'll do- I need a- I just got this PC!

507
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,240
Oh, my God!

508
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:38,680
I just- I just bought this PC- Like, I- Okay, to be fair, I got this PC for free.

509
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,780
But now I'm spending money on this PC.

510
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:45,060
Now I'm spending money- Holy shit!

511
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,360
I'm spending money on this PC!

512
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,120
Even though I just got it.

513
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,360
Even though I got it for free...

514
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,580
Anyway, are you guys sure?

515
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,260
Are you guys sure I should keep it, like, undervote?

516
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:09,740
Or- Or- Because, like, it's been on- I only had it undervoted for Marvel Rivals and then I- Uh, I only, um...

517
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:22,140
Uh, I only have it undervoted for Marvel Rivals and then I did it back to, uh, the And then I did it back to the original vault, which was 57x.

518
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,320
Just to be safe?

519
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,300
Yes, it could die.

520
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:25,620
Okay.

521
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,340
Alright.

522
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,280
Alright.

523
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,460
I'll... yeah.

524
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,800
Okay, I'll do... I'll keep it undervaulted.

525
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,500
Alright!

526
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,640
I can't believe it.

527
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,440
There's too much vault charge in Roblox.

528
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,800
It's fucking Roblox!

529
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,480
It's fucking Roblox!

530
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,280
Alright,

531
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,960
what's the new... what's the new... new...

532
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,620
Okay, anyway.

533
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,440
As I was saying...

534
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,420
Oh, choose the next theme?

535
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,400
Oh!

536
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,920
I don't... okay, I want...

537
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,580
I want FNAF.

538
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,000
Not enough theme props?!

539
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,380
I don't have...

540
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,520
Okay, I'm too poor to choose.

541
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,200
Guys...

542
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,160
Guys, they won't let me pick because I'm too poor.

543
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,780
I don't... I can't pick because I'm too poor.

544
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,620
The theme is Ghost vs.

545
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,240
Ghoul.

546
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,580
Okay, Ghost vs.

547
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,040
Ghoul is in the poor section.

548
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,300
I wish I had Queen of Hearts!

549
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,320
I wish...

550
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:23,800
Wow!

551
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:24,880
She flipping!

552
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,020
Okay, I need the money.

553
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,840
I need... I need...

554
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,940
She's already has clothes on?!

555
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,480
Ghost vs Ghouls...

556
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,340
Ghost!

557
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,380
I'll be a ghost!

558
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,140
Ghosts are easy!

559
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,320
Okay, um...

560
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,400
What is spooky?

561
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,360
What... What is spooky?

562
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,340
Um...

563
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,860
Oh my god, what is a spooky?

564
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,320
What is a sp... Oh!

565
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,020
Okay, there you go.

566
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,340
Oh, she looks like, you know, a screamer.

567
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,280
She looks like a screaming ghost.

568
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,460
And then all white.

569
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:53,920
Okay.

570
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,020
Uh, and then bangs.

571
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,440
Uh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

572
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,200
I don't like that.

573
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,200
I don't like that.

574
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,100
Let's do like...

575
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,760
Full white bangs.

576
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,000
Oh, I don't like that.

577
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,000
I don't like that.

578
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:05,740
Wait, I can combine?

579
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:07,480
Uh...

580
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,720
I'll do bangs.

581
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,800
That'll be cute.

582
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,620
Okay, nice.

583
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,060
All right.

584
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,740
They'll be unique.

585
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,020
Yeah, there you go.

586
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,780
I'm unique.

587
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,220
Okay, um...

588
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,180
We're...

589
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,400
How do I not be...

590
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,640
How do I not be blue?

591
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,800
Oh, it's makeup.

592
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,400
Oh, I can have...

593
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,420
I need money for makeup.

594
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,480
Oh...

595
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:31,570
I'm poor.

596
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:40,090
I can't believe it.

597
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:42,050
I need money for makeup.

598
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:43,610
Okay.

599
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:44,870
Um...

600
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:46,750
Uh...

601
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:48,210
All right.

602
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:49,210
That's cute.

603
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,270
Right?

604
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:51,550
That's cute.

605
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,150
Oh, god.

606
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:53,510
Okay.

607
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:53,670
Okay.

608
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:54,290
Um...

609
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,690
Yeah, that's fine.

610
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,450
I'll do that.

611
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,550
I'll do that.

612
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:58,170
I'll do that.

613
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:58,610
Okay.

614
00:28:58,690 --> 00:28:59,350
Why am I blue?

615
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,330
I don't want to be blue.

616
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,220
Okay.

617
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,640
Oh, screen isn't cropped.

618
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:08,920
No!

619
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,620
My screen isn't cropped correctly!

620
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,560
I'm sorry.

621
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,680
I'm a mess right now.

622
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,320
I'm a fucking mess.

623
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,360
I'm a...

624
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,040
No!

625
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,700
Guys, please.

626
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,460
Please give me some time.

627
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,200
Please, children.

628
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,740
Children, please!

629
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,060
Please!

630
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:29,700
Children!

631
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,400
Children, let me have a little bib time!

632
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,220
Children, please.

633
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,860
Anyone say, nobody wants to talk to the poor.

634
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,020
Nobody...

635
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,300
God's...

636
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,440
Nobody wants to talk to the poor.

637
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,220
Um...

638
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:48,940
Um...

639
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,700
What is...

640
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,260
What is...

641
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:50,820
What is...

642
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,540
Oh, I can be an old Victorian ghoul.

643
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,340
No.

644
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:54,820
Okay.

645
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,560
No, that's ugly.

646
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,180
Never mind.

647
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,280
Oh, I can be a...

648
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,920
Oh, I can have a necklace!

649
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,080
Yes, yes, yes.

650
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,820
Oh, your outfit is...

651
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,060

652
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,150

653
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,400
What I was...

654
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,340
I'm gonna copy your shit.

655
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,560
Fuck you, bitch.

656
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,420
I...

657
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,880
I'm gonna steal your fit.

658
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,100
I'm gonna do it.

659
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,600
I ain't no fucking...

660
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,220
I'm not scared.

661
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,760
I'm gonna steal your fucking fit.

662
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,520
All right.

663
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:26,900
Um...

664
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,040
Have some empathy, children.

665
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,440
Oh, wait.

666
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:30,980
What's this?

667
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:31,800
Wait.

668
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,940
Oh, fuck.

669
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,640
I don't want this.

670
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,740
How do I take it off?

671
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,940
How do I take it off?

672
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,660
How do I...

673
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,900
How do I take it off?

674
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:38,820
Oh, no.

675
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:39,580
Okay.

676
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,220
Um...

677
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:41,600
Okay.

678
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,020
I don't...

679
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:42,340
I...

680
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,000
Um...

681
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Yes, I'm gonna...

682
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,240
No!

683
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,220
Okay.

684
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,300
We're gonna make do with this.

685
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:46,760
We're gonna...

686
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,680
We're gonna make do with this.

687
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,780
It's not what I want to take off.

688
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,980
I only have a minute left.

689
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,520
I'm...

690
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,380
I'm not okay.

691
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,040
I'm not okay right now.

692
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:53,980
I'm not...

693
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:57,120
I mean, I'm not okay at the moment.

694
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,180
Um...

695
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,100
Um...

696
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,120
I want...

697
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,000
Uh...

698
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,460
Okay.

699
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,080
There we go.

700
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:02,860
There we go.

701
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:03,420
That's...

702
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:03,720
Gooly.

703
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,800
Oh, okay.

704
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,780
No, not like that.

705
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,660
How do I get the other color?

706
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,840
I want to change that color.

707
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,740
Oh, over here.

708
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,020
Okay.

709
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:10,500
Okay.

710
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,100
Uh...

711
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,020
There we go.

712
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,620
Does this feel...

713
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,140
Cool?

714
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:14,380
Cool?

715
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,060
Oh, this is terrible.

716
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,600
This is so bad.

717
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,800
Everybody else looks so good.

718
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,040
That is not Ghost vs Ghouls.

719
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,240
Get the fuck out of here.

720
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,300
Attack some Squidward.

721
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,120
How do they change?

722
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,220
How do they...

723
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,380
Oh, it's a Ghoul.

724
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:30,900
Wait.

725
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,620
Oh my God.

726
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:32,920
Okay.

727
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,260
Okay.

728
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:33,980
Okay, guys.

729
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:34,940
Guys, we're still...

730
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,360
How do I change my color?

731
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,440
How do I...

732
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,920
No, I'm too poor for that section.

733
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,620
No, stop telling me how poor I am.

734
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,020
That's a...

735
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,700
That's a zombie that looks like Squidward.

736
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,120
Oh, nice.

737
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,040
I got $18.

738
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,060
How do I...

739
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:52,940
How do I change...

740
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,300
Is it here?

741
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,140
Oh, it's my nails.

742
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:55,560
Okay.

743
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,440
Um...

744
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,600
There we go.

745
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:58,500
Nice.

746
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,240
Slay, girl.

747
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,860
See, if you have no money, it's okay.

748
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,740
The pods?

749
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,080
The pods?

750
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,380
There's pods?

751
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,180
Where the pop people at?

752
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,080
The white lights near the jeans?

753
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,900
The fact that you guys know so much about this scares me a little.

754
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,020
Because it tells me that you guys definitely spent money on this game.

755
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,180
Like, shoes.

756
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:18,960
Shoes!

757
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:19,820
I'm fucking...

758
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,460
I have no shoes!

759
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,180
Oh, no.

760
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:22,920
Oh, no.

761
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:23,640
Oh, no.

762
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,480
Where are the shoes at?

763
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,640
Where are the shoes at?

764
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,580
Okay, I'm gonna put these on.

765
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,140
I don't have anything else, guys.

766
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:31,940
I don't...

767
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,340
I'm...

768
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,440
I'm...

769
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,140
My internet is seed.

770
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,000
Guys.

771
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,400
Guys.

772
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,060
Nooooo!

773
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,780
Nooooo!

774
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,140
My internet!

775
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:07,190
I- Are you fucking- My internet- I'll never be able to show my fit!

776
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:16,540
I'll never- I'll never be able to- What is wrong with me today?!

777
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:20,000
I'll never be able to be fashionable!

778
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,780
I just wanna be fashionable.

779
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:25,020
I just wanna be fashionable with the children.

780
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,480
I can't.

781
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,540
I can't.

782
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,500
Why is Roblox... Why?

783
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:40,820
Why are you like this?

784
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,900
Roblox!

785
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,800
No, I can't even...

786
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,100
I don't want to stop my Roblox.

787
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,860
Why is everything not working?

788
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:55,360
Everything is not okay.

789
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:59,780
Nothing is okay right now.

790
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,660
It's the arcade!

791
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,180
Okay, we're doing this again!

792
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:09,280
Oh my god, I feel so far right now.

793
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:14,420
I feel like I am roleplaying as a...

794
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,620
My internet...

795
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,180
I forgot to pay my internet bills.

796
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,200
I have to be poor!

797
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,620
Like, I have to be VIP.

798
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,240
Everything is full of me.

799
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,760
Today is not the day.

800
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:34,400
I never get to show my face at all.

801
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,260
So, fuck.

802
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,460
I fucking will be very fast.

803
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,700
Very fast.

804
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,760
It's going to be...

805
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,280
Horror!

806
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,580
I don't know.

807
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,600
I don't know.

808
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:55,960
Oh my god.

809
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,120
Holy shit.

810
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,980
I'm gonna be a fucking star.

811
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,060
No money, no internet.

812
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,780
Children bullying me.

813
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:17,340
I just wanna be Freddy Fazbear.

814
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,900
Freddy Fazbear.

815
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:34,720
I don't know what is Freddy.

816
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,380
They won't know.

817
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:41,680
They're gonna be like, what the fuck is wrong with this bitch's fucking fit?

818
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,300
Like, I'm sorry, I'm trying my best.

819
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,660
I am.

820
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,760
I really am.

821
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,640
I don't know what else would Freddy Fazbear...

822
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,880
What would Freddy Fazbear look like if he was...

823
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,180
If he had...

824
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,000
If he was a bear.

825
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,900
Oh, this, this, this.

826
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,100
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

827
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:02,540
Okay.

828
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,520
Wait, this is what he'll look like if he was a bear.

829
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,000
Wait, I mean if...

830
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,540
Sorry.

831
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,820
This is what he'll look like if he was a person.

832
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,940
He's already...

833
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,260
He's already...

834
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:12,620
A bear.

835
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,800
He's already...

836
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,240
Sorry, he's already...

837
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,820
Guys, I'm not okay right now.

838
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,100
I DC'd twice.

839
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,400
I DC'd.

840
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,240
And then I fucking blue screen like...

841
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,560
Pick a struggle.

842
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,640
Okay.

843
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,960
Pick a fucking struggle in lane.

844
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,860
And I'm getting bullied by children.

845
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,200
Who have spent their mom's credit card money.

846
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:37,800
Okay.

847
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,540
No, I don't have $5,000.

848
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,240
I don't even know how much money I have.

849
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,400
How much money I do have.

850
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,000
Like...

851
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,860
Holy shit.

852
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:54,200
I'm trying to be Freddy Fazbear from the arcades.

853
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,300
That's themed.

854
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,100
That's a theme right now.

855
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:57,920
Okay.

856
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,340
I'm trying.

857
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:00,980
Do I...

858
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,160
Oh my god.

859
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,560
He picked Penelope.

860
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,200
Okay.

861
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,060
I'm trying to know what pants to wear.

862
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,340
Oh my god.

863
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,060
Okay.

864
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,220
Do I have to...

865
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,700
That's a fucking dolphin.

866
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,400
That's nice.

867
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:16,920
Okay.

868
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,140
Alright.

869
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,220
There we go.

870
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,220
Freddy Fazbear.

871
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:20,720
Okay.

872
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,680
I need to change my...

873
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:21,980
Okay.

874
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:22,600
I need...

875
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,260
I need to get pants.

876
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,440
I need to get pants.

877
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,100
Like...

878
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:26,800
I don't know.

879
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,100
I need to get pants.

880
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:28,900
Oh.

881
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:30,720
Oh.

882
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,440
Okay.

883
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,020
There we go.

884
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,420
And then let me change my clothes.

885
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,380
Okay.

886
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,300
Oh.

887
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,120
Oh.

888
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,220
Oh.

889
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:42,260
I don't know.

890
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,980
What tone is that?

891
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,440
There you go.

892
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,120
Hoor.

893
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:46,620
Hoor.

894
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,100
Hoor.

895
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:47,400
Hoor.

896
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:47,900
Hoor.

897
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,580
That's a fucking dolphin.

898
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,100
Like what?

899
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,500
That's not even...

900
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,820
That's not even...

901
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:53,120
Oh no.

902
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:53,760
17 seconds.

903
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,240
I need pants.

904
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:54,760
I need pants.

905
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:55,900
Um...

906
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,720
What goes well?

907
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:57,220
Ah.

908
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,500
Oh.

909
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,000
This doesn't look good.

910
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:00,900
Oh.

911
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,660
I put everything on.

912
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,460
Okay.

913
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,120
Here we go.

914
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,160
Oh.

915
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,440
Oh god.

916
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:09,820
Okay.

917
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,680
Do you think they'll recognize it?

918
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,200
Do you think they'll recognize it?

919
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,840
Do you guys think the children will recognize it?

920
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,220
Okay.

921
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,380
You're not even trying.

922
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,000
You're not even one star.

923
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,420
That's not even...

924
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,920
You're not even trying your best right now.

925
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,740
Like what is this?

926
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,440
What is this?

927
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,980
You just put everything on.

928
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,560
Oh.

929
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,480
Wait.

930
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,440
They put...

931
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,780
What the fuck?

932
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:39,840
Bro...

933
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,080
Brian's a runaway queen?

934
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,520
Three stars.

935
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,480
Oh my god.

936
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,420
Brian is a...

937
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,480
Oh my god.

938
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,880
And he's doing the Mario poses.

939
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:52,960
Oh.

940
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,700
These kids.

941
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,600
Who the fuck is Lucille?

942
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,740
What are you?

943
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,380
One star.

944
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,520
Like what are you?

945
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,100
You're just going to the god damn mall.

946
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,300
Like this is not a fit...

947
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:08,960
That's just a girl.

948
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,240
That's just...

949
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:10,880
Okay.

950
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,060
Okay.

951
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,800
That's just a girl.

952
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,840
Like at least...

953
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,120
Bro!

954
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,100
That's two girls!

955
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:17,840
These...

956
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,160
You do not see these girls in a fucking arcade.

957
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:20,840
Like...

958
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,140
That is not arcade material.

959
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,560
How are you going to play?

960
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,780
How are you going to play the drum game in that fit?

961
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:28,640
Girl.

962
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,560
How are you going to play the drum game in that fit?

963
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:35,800
Your makeup's going to run with full of sweat because you're trying too hard.

964
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,280
So true.

965
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,960
But she has...

966
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,060
Oh my god.

967
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,040
She plays... you can't even play!

968
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:44,880
What's this?

969
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,480
It's not arcade.

970
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,980
You don't even... you can't even... you're a fashion maven?

971
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,680
Go back to fashion school.

972
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,520
What is that?

973
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,480
What the fuck?

974
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,620
What are you?

975
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:00,960
Getting...

976
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,400
Trying to get some bitches?

977
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,560
Like what?

978
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,920
Oh, you're gonna jump around?

979
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,540
That is not Mario.

980
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:10,540
Oh the fashion maven.

981
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,840
One star.

982
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,840
This is not to the theme.

983
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:19,160
Guys, guys, do they think they notice that I'm Freddy Fazbear?

984
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,760
Do they think they have from the arcade?

985
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:30,400
Yeah, oh I'm so confident right there.

986
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,380
They have Luigi?

987
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:42,220
Oh my god!

988
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,600
Three stars.

989
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,640
Three stars.

990
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:53,000
I'm like the Asia star rating because in Asia apparently people don't rate... people don't rate above three stars.

991
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,100
Wait, no.

992
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,660
No, that's a minion.

993
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,940
Wait a minute.

994
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,600
That's a fucking minion.

995
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,460
That's not even arcade.

996
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,080
That's a good costume.

997
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,980
But that's... not to theme.

998
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,240
Not to theme.

999
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,940
Girl, you cannot... you cannot do that and just not be to theme.

1000
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,180
Oh wait you can...

1001
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,060
Oh my... this is not fair.

1002
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,040
She's clearly rich.

1003
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,800
This is not fair.

1004
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,240
Three stars.

1005
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,740
That is cheating!

1006
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,960
She clearly has money!

1007
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,300
Like, this is so fucked!

1008
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,320
You're clearly... I... this is not fair!

1009
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,380
They went in with Mario and Luigi!

1010
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:50,340
Oh, I got fourth!

1011
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,400
I got fourth!

1012
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,640
I got fourth!

1013
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,340
Yeah, fuck you bitches!

1014
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:59,260
I might be poor, but I have style and fashion.

1015
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:03,440
I knew what the kids like, and the kids like FNAF!

1016
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,480
I know!

1017
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:08,960
I knew what the children like to see, and the children like...

1018
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,700
Not last.

1019
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:20,220
I got third place for the first time.

1020
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,580
Oh my God!

1021
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,340
Guys!

1022
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:28,520
This is my first game and I got fourth place.

1023
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,500
I'm scared.

1024
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,600
Oh my god, yes, slay!

1025
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,400
Anyway...

1026
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:44,510
Let me win then.

1027
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:51,350
Luigi isn't a girl!

1028
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,110
It's a man!

1029
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,830
What the f***?

1030
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:01,430
Shit.

1031
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:02,990
Bro, okay.

1032
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,610
Wait, how do I get rid of my clothes?

1033
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:08,250
Okay, how do I get rid of my makeup?

1034
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:09,810
What is this?

1035
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:11,490
Um...

1036
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:13,430
How do I get rid of my makeup?

1037
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:14,330
First Lady?

1038
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,330
Oh shit, what the f***?

1039
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:18,370
Okay.

1040
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:20,030
Um, white.

1041
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:22,110
Um...

1042
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:23,090
Um...

1043
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,370
I don't know.

1044
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:26,010
I don't know.

1045
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,550
We don't have First Ladies.

1046
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:30,310
We have Prime Ministers.

1047
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:31,270
And...

1048
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,270
First Minister?

1049
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:35,850
First Lady Minister?

1050
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:38,270
What do we call him?

1051
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:40,830
Do we call the Prime Minister his wife?

1052
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:46,690
What do we even call the Prime Minister's wife?

1053
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:47,930
I don't f***ing know.

1054
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,630
What do we call the First Prime?

1055
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:58,550
Prime Lady?

1056
00:43:59,030 --> 00:43:59,590
Like...

1057
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:01,130
Yeah, we just call her wife!

1058
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:02,630
She's just wife!

1059
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:03,370
Like...

1060
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:05,270
I'm not American!

1061
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:09,330
How the f*** am I supposed to know what the First Lady looks like?!

1062
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:10,070
Okay.

1063
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:12,990
Oh no.

1064
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:16,850
Whore, whore, whore, whore, whore, whore, whore, whore, whore, whore.

1065
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:18,270
Optimus Prime.

1066
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:23,830
She's an expensive gal.

1067
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:28,390
That's when you know this First Lady is f***ing committing tax fraud.

1068
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:31,690
What is it called when they dip into the funds?

1069
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:32,630
When...

1070
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:36,950
When they start dipping into government funding?

1071
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:43,790
Felony?

1072
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:46,210
Yeah, but there's a word for it.

1073
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:48,110
Embezzlement.

1074
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:48,390
Yeah.

1075
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:51,250
That's when you know my lady is embezzling.

1076
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:55,510
That's when you know...

1077
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:56,970
They always have the same haircut.

1078
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:58,270
Like the...

1079
00:44:58,270 --> 00:44:59,150
Like...

1080
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:00,130
No, not this one.

1081
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:00,770
Like...

1082
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:02,510
Oh, it's sort of like that, but short.

1083
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:03,050
Like not...

1084
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:03,870
Less wavy.

1085
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:06,370
It's sort of like that, but...

1086
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,070
Oh f*** it.

1087
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:08,030
Let's just make Michelle Obama.

1088
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:11,530
Like I'm already halfway.

1089
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:12,510
I'm already there.

1090
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:13,850
You know I'm already there.

1091
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:19,690
I'm literally already there.

1092
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:23,010
Okay.

1093
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:25,370
Okay.

1094
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:27,930
Oh, f***.

1095
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:28,890
F***ing weeb all.

1096
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:32,050
Let's see.

1097
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:33,310
There we go.

1098
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:34,050
I think we're there.

1099
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:34,650
I think...

1100
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:35,510
I think we did it.

1101
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:36,530
This is...

1102
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:38,170
This should be her, right?

1103
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:39,090
I don't know.

1104
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:42,150
I don't pay attention to what's going on in America.

1105
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:44,770
Oh, I need a bag!

1106
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:45,290
You're right!

1107
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:46,390
You're right!

1108
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:47,670
I need a bag!

1109
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:48,770
All right.

1110
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:50,890
There we go.

1111
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:51,590
Easy.

1112
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:53,190
Is there like a nicer bag?

1113
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,290
Like a nicer, like...

1114
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:57,610
I'm the first lady back.

1115
00:45:57,950 --> 00:45:59,310
You're so fake.

1116
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:02,070
You're so first lady right now.

1117
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:03,190
Wait.

1118
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:04,150
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1119
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:04,990
Like this, right?

1120
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:08,770
Oh, she doesn't wear that hat.

1121
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:09,790
I don't fucking know.

1122
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:11,330
I don't remember what she wears.

1123
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:15,150
Like, I barely pay attention to fashion anyway!

1124
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:19,110
Thanks to Obama.

1125
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:21,030
Thank you for the super chat.

1126
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:21,710
That's so dead.

1127
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:22,250
Well, thank you.

1128
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:22,850
Thank you.

1129
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:23,690
Why is there a mermaid?

1130
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:25,810
I don't fucking know why there's a mermaid here.

1131
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:28,090
Like, this mermaid.

1132
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:32,770
My god, you guys know more about the first lady than I do.

1133
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:33,970
Stop it.

1134
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:34,770
I'm not rich.

1135
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:37,930
Somebody... guys, whoever stream... who my stream sniper?

1136
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:40,490
Fucking stream snipe me as VIP right now.

1137
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:47,350
Give me my...

1138
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:49,790
Guys.

1139
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,230
Guys, I'm...

1140
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:53,770
I'm like... I'm the charity case guy.

1141
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:56,470
I hate that you guys stream snipe me as well.

1142
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:00,770
Give me a scholarship right now.

1143
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:03,710
Give me a scholarship and get me out of here.

1144
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:05,350
I don't wanna be poor anymore.

1145
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:08,790
I don't wanna be poor and get bullied by children.

1146
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:17,770
The first lady needs funding.

1147
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:19,270
She can't keep embezzling.

1148
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:21,970
Like, I'm like... fucking restricted.

1149
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:22,890
I'm like... fucking restricted with everything.

1150
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,970
There's like four hats here!

1151
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:28,410
There's literally four hats!

1152
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:29,650
Like...

1153
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:32,430
Like...

1154
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:34,330
Bro, you copied my fit!

1155
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:36,470
I'm Michelle Obama!

1156
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:39,890
That's not Michelle Obama!

1157
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:41,470
Look at you!

1158
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:42,630
You fucking...

1159
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:45,430
Michelle Obama never wears red.

1160
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:45,930
Michelle Obama never wears red.

1161
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:46,310
I think.

1162
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:46,970
I don't know.

1163
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:47,990
I don't pay attention.

1164
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:48,650
I think.

1165
00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:51,090
I don't know.

1166
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:51,990
I don't pay attention.

1167
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:52,370
I did!

1168
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:53,810
Fuck you bitch!

1169
00:47:57,090 --> 00:48:00,010
I, Michelle Obama, I claimed!

1170
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:02,450
I claimed the Obamas first!

1171
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:03,930
Like...

1172
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:08,290
There's only room for one Michelle Obama.

1173
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:11,990
I'm picking up for two Michelle's.

1174
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:13,170
There's one!

1175
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:14,670
It's not first ladies!

1176
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:16,170
It's first lady!

1177
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:17,930
Like, come on.

1178
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:21,590
Mrs. President, Mrs. President, get down.

1179
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,130
No, no, she's like conservative.

1180
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:26,090
She's...

1181
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:29,850
Today she doesn't want to show her legs.

1182
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:32,930
She doesn't want to show her legs today, guys.

1183
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:34,710
Um, okay.

1184
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:39,550
She doesn't want to show her legs today!

1185
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:42,310
She's gotta do it for the kids!

1186
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:45,850
Jesus, that's not first lady!

1187
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:47,290
What the fuck are you?

1188
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:51,130
That's a...

1189
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:51,990
That's a...

1190
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:52,410
That's Snow White!

1191
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:53,070
That's a...

1192
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:58,010
That's a first lady princess.

1193
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:01,230
Which founding father was a lady?

1194
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:01,770
Which founding father was a lady?

1195
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:04,670
One star for not even being on theme.

1196
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:05,150
One star for not even being on theme.

1197
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,250
What the fuck?

1198
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:08,790
Oh, yes!

1199
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:11,090
I got my scholarship!

1200
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:13,610
Peace out, nerds!

1201
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:14,850
I got my scholarship!

1202
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:17,910
I'm going to boarding school!

1203
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:20,090
I'm going to a private boarding school!

1204
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,730
I'm going to Ivy League now!

1205
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:26,390
I'm crawled through from the poor to become...

1206
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:26,650
I'm crawled through from the poor to become...

1207
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:27,810
to get my scholarship!

1208
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:34,950
Yeah!

1209
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:38,230
No shot!

1210
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,250
No way!

1211
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:42,130
One star, not even a theme!

1212
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:44,130
That's... who is that?

1213
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:45,350
Are you...

1214
00:49:45,350 --> 00:50:09,350
Are you...

1215
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:15,010
Wait!

1216
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:15,330
EVE???

1217
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:19,370
Michelle...

1218
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:20,540
Michelle...

1219
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,100
...Pilfer...

1220
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:32,280
Holy shit, Michelle!

1221
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:36,300
I can't believe Obama got censored!

1222
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,060
How am I gonna do thanks Obama?

1223
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:44,520
I can't...how am I gonna be scared?

1224
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,280
How can I say thanks Obama?

1225
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:46,620
Mama!

1226
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,460
Who's Jackie?

1227
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,340
That's a child!

1228
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:53,660
Oh my god, that's a child!

1229
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,640
Somebody literally said, who's Jackie?

1230
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,140
Holy shit, who the fuck is he?

1231
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,420
Oh no!

1232
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:12,800
Yeah, I didn't do any poses because like, the first lady has to be very reserved and like...

1233
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,160
Who the fuck?

1234
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,400
Oh that is... what is that?

1235
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,200
Dang, you don't have plans.

1236
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:20,960
Okay, one star.

1237
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,860
Everybody gets one star.

1238
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:29,300
Yeah, but she does one hell of a split.

1239
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,740
I like how everybody's like, who are you?

1240
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:34,640
Oh my god.

1241
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:37,780
One star, you fucking pit stealer!

1242
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:42,180
Michelle would never win those fucking...

1243
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,340
um... necklaces.

1244
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,460
Michelle would never do a dead drop.

1245
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:52,080
I literally searched Michelle in Pinterest.

1246
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,200
I apologize.

1247
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,300
You cheated!

1248
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:58,360
You googled in Pinterest?

1249
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,880
I did it from memory!

1250
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,740
I did that from fucking memory!

1251
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,220
And this bitch cheated.

1252
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:12,220
I'm looking up on...

1253
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,420
Pinterest.

1254
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:19,180
It like, literally came to me in a dream.

1255
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:20,960
Who are you?

1256
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:26,380
I feel like I'm playing... I'm sorry Michelle, I failed you.

1257
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:28,500
I'm playing in Olive Garden.

1258
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,080
The wife of...

1259
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:30,900
sucks.

1260
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,360
What the fuck is this game?

1261
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:40,020
I'm playing in Olive Garden.

1262
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,580
Oh okay, this one's...

1263
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:42,820
I recognize her.

1264
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:45,720
Who is Jill?

1265
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:52,260
At least you can blame on Olive Garden.

1266
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,960
Guys, I have to be first place from that.

1267
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:57,780
I did... YES!

1268
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,400
I did it!

1269
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:02,840
Thank you Obama!

1270
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:04,960
Thank you!

1271
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:06,560
Wait...

1272
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,820
Thanks Obama!

1273
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,620
Thank you!

1274
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,480
Thank you!

1275
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:11,920
Thank you Obama!

1276
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,120
Thanks Michelle!

1277
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:28,020
I can't even say thanks Obama!

1278
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:29,960
I can't...

1279
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,880
Even if I put it in space.

1280
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:36,040
That's right.

1281
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,400
I got my scholarship.

1282
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,820
I ain't poor like you guys now.

1283
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:45,300
I got it from Shira Will and being fabulous.

1284
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,120
Thanks.

1285
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:49,300
Oh my god.

1286
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,300
I have VIP access now.

1287
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:53,280
I...

1288
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,080
The Roblox thing.

1289
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:01,020
No, Obama is censored no matter what.

1290
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:03,420
I can't even like... I can't even...

1291
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:04,220
Um...

1292
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:09,820
I can't even like fucking do it with like a space in between two.

1293
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,040
Yeah, that's right.

1294
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:13,600
I'm not a charity case.

1295
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,460
I'm just special.

1296
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,240
Then you could see how good I am.

1297
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:18,880
At...

1298
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,040
Mythology.

1299
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,120
You guys are gonna be on the poor section.

1300
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,180
See you later losers.

1301
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,840
I'm fabulous enough.

1302
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:28,540
Oh wings.

1303
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,360
Oh my god.

1304
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:30,300
Wings.

1305
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:31,320
Mythology.

1306
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,600
I'm gonna be a...

1307
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,960
I'll be an angel.

1308
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:36,840
That's not...

1309
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:38,980
That didn't mean that.

1310
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:39,660
I didn't...

1311
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:39,980
Oh my god.

1312
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:41,100
I could be Mikatsune.

1313
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:45,480
Mikatsune is technically a mythological creature.

1314
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:47,180
Okay.

1315
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:48,960
Um...

1316
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:49,980
I could be an elf.

1317
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:53,800
Alright, here we go.

1318
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,000
Um...

1319
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,300
I wanna do like...

1320
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:56,780
I wanna...

1321
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:57,860
I wanna do like...

1322
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:58,680
Uh...

1323
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:59,300
Uh...

1324
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,400
What's his name?

1325
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,500
The Hermes.

1326
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,360
I wanna do Hermes.

1327
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:02,960
Is there like...

1328
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,060
Is there like...

1329
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,480
Shoes with wings?

1330
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,820
I'm gonna be Hermes.

1331
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:09,680
Miku.

1332
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,340
Who is legendary?

1333
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:11,780
I'm gonna be Hermes.

1334
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:14,380
Okay, let's see.

1335
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:15,460
See you later.

1336
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,780
I got the rich people section now.

1337
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,080
Let's see, is there rich people here?

1338
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,640
Let's see...

1339
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,420
Where...

1340
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:29,920
Yeah, I need wings on shoes but like where am I gonna find that?

1341
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:33,740
What would Hermes look like if Hermes was a woman?

1342
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:37,500
Alright.

1343
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:39,080
Okay.

1344
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:39,660
Here we go.

1345
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:39,900
Whoa!

1346
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,300
If Hermes was a woman, what would you look like?

1347
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:50,020
To be fair, back then, like, they're turning into women and men and just fucking everything, to be fair.

1348
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:50,900
So, like...

1349
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,720
Wait, this is such a tiny area for the rich section.

1350
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,060
That's it?

1351
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,440
I'm rich and this is all I get?

1352
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,560
The poor people get, like, 200,000, like...

1353
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,360
Like, outfits.

1354
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:04,500
That's not fair.

1355
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,760
It's Hermes, not Inmes.

1356
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:13,960
That's so true.

1357
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:14,920
So...

1358
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,360
That's so true.

1359
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:20,620
So good.

1360
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,900
Fucking hell, that's so fucking good.

1361
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:24,980
What the fuck?

1362
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,500
I mean...

1363
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:27,880
That's fair.

1364
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:29,340
They're ready sea creatures.

1365
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:30,080
Like, what the...

1366
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,800
They're ready sea creatures.

1367
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:33,420
What am I supposed to do with that?

1368
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,280
Okay.

1369
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,020
Alright, we're gonna...

1370
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,860
I'm Hermes, but my wings are on my back instead of my shoes.

1371
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:46,540
That's really good.

1372
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:47,460
I know.

1373
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:48,540
I was like, jeez.

1374
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:50,560
Wait, what's this?

1375
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:51,180
Ooh.

1376
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:52,080
No.

1377
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:54,840
Uh, wait.

1378
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:57,440
Oh, oh, I know what that is.

1379
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:57,800
Okay.

1380
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:58,480
Let's see.

1381
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,720
Is there a shoe I can put it on?

1382
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:02,780
That's, like, vaguely wing-like.

1383
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:03,420
Oh, okay.

1384
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,220
We're gonna put on this.

1385
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:06,540
Um...

1386
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,160
Oh, I can be Valkyrie!

1387
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,940
I'm supposed to be like, I'm Valkyrie!

1388
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,100
Oh my god, you're right!

1389
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:11,600
You're right!

1390
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:12,440
I'm a Valkyrie!

1391
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:13,180
Wait!

1392
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,540
Oh my god, you guys are so smart.

1393
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,340
You guys are so fucking smart.

1394
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:17,780
Okay.

1395
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:18,600
Uh...

1396
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,660
That is the shoe base.

1397
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:22,200
I need to change this.

1398
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:24,120
Uh, I'll change it to...

1399
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:26,640
Oh my god, you guys are so fucking smart, though.

1400
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:29,520
Uh...

1401
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,260
Let's see.

1402
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,280
I'll do... I think you should be white, actually.

1403
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,900
Alright, this is logical.

1404
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,740
Holy fucking shit.

1405
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,980
That's right, I'm a Valkyrie.

1406
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:50,280
Okay.

1407
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,580
I'm just gonna be like this this entire time.

1408
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:55,200
Alright, let's see.

1409
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,520
A minute and forty-eight seconds.

1410
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:58,380
Is there a way... I need to get a sword!

1411
00:57:58,500 --> 00:57:58,880
I know!

1412
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:00,660
Dude, I don't think they're gonna have swords!

1413
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:04,140
I don't think they're gonna have swords in fucking ROBLOX!

1414
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,220
I cannot even say... I can't even say, thanks, Obama!

1415
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:08,880
You think they're gonna have swords?

1416
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,160
Like, you really think?

1417
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:10,800
You know?

1418
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:14,820
If I can't even say, thanks, Obama!

1419
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:17,760
You think they're gonna give swords in this game?

1420
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:20,860
Alright, let's see.

1421
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:21,340
What's this?

1422
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:22,840
Oh, okay.

1423
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:25,880
Maybe.

1424
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:26,640
Maybe.

1425
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:30,280
Oh my god.

1426
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:30,560
Okay.

1427
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:31,860
I got jewelry on.

1428
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,460
I got jewelry on.

1429
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:34,160
I think it's good.

1430
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,600
I think... That Twilight Sparkle!

1431
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,060
Okay, tech, get to it.

1432
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:39,620
Twilight Sparkle is in a mess!

1433
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,420
She's real to me.

1434
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,180
That's so fucked up.

1435
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:53,300
What the fuck?

1436
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:57,200
Okay.

1437
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,740
We don't fuck...

1438
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:00,620
You guys are saying there's like...

1439
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,760
There's like a...

1440
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,040
Yeah, I'm a Valkyrie!

1441
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:04,820
A Valkyrie doesn't wear...

1442
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:07,940
A Valkyrie doesn't even wear halos!

1443
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:08,640
What do you mean?

1444
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,340
Let's see.

1445
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:16,120
Is there actually any wings on?

1446
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:16,820
No, okay.

1447
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:17,820
Uh...

1448
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:19,960
God, I wish there was a sword.

1449
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:23,560
I wish there was a sword!

1450
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:25,340
It's not fair!

1451
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:27,100
Where would I want a sword?

1452
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:35,700
I think this is the perfect thing I can do.

1453
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,740
This is the best I can do, guys, in this scenario.

1454
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,900
I'll just be like, I'm a Valkyrie.

1455
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:42,060
I'll... I'll...

1456
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:43,680
Vote for me, children.

1457
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,220
What else can I do?

1458
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:49,700
What the fuck is this?

1459
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:52,860
What is that?

1460
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:57,340
I'm a disco ball because I didn't like this!

1461
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,200
I'll give you two star for that.

1462
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,740
I'll give you...

1463
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:06,320
What

1464
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,060
the fuck is she?

1465
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,300
Is that Zeus?

1466
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:14,600
How?

1467
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:17,120
How is that Zeus?

1468
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,380
Why does he have a microphone?

1469
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:22,260
Why does he have a microphone?

1470
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:27,300
Guys, it's all about the theming.

1471
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:28,760
Guys, oh...

1472
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,520
I'm a...

1473
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:33,340
Valkyrie.

1474
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,840
Oh my god, breathtaking!

1475
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:42,780
Yes!

1476
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:43,960
Aide!

1477
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,220
Best one yet!

1478
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,260
Oh!

1479
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:49,860
Oh, who's that?

1480
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:51,660
What the fuck?

1481
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:54,220
Get educated, you little child!

1482
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:55,540
You baby!

1483
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:57,860
Okay.

1484
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:00,060
Alright, that phoenix gets two stars.

1485
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:01,380
That phoenix...

1486
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:02,240

1487
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,560
I can't believe it!

1488
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:06,360
This bitch said who's that!

1489
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:09,640
Go back to fucking school before you go to fashion school!

1490
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,320
Get an education!

1491
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:12,420

01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:19,640
Why do you have a...

1496
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:20,920

1497
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:22,540
Hahaha!

1498
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:23,720

01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:28,240
No...

1503
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:28,780
No...

1504
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:30,420
Why does she...

1505
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:30,680
Oh!

1506
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:32,620

Oh my god!

1511
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:44,580
Girl, you know what's up, girl!

1512
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:45,800
Hahaha!

1513
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,280
Oh my god...

1515
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:50,600

01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:51,320
Slave girl.

1517
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:52,380
Hahaha!

1518
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:55,900
That's actually so good.

1519
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:56,980
I forgot to do poses!

1520
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:57,700
I forgot to do poses!

1521
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:59,300
Oh, I can't!

1522
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,060
I forgot to do poses!

1523
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:02,920
Two stars.

1524
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:06,860
10 out of 10.

1525
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:09,680
She's a flop, bro.

1526
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:12,780
Girl, you ate and left no crumbs.

1527
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:16,060
Oh my god, is that like Twilight Sparkle?

1528
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:16,960
Oh my god!

1529
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:24,420
I know I can't be you because I'm me.

1530
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:29,980
Good doki.

1531
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:31,960

01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:33,440

I'm from Etsy.

1536
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,580
No one knows who this is.

1537
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:49,220
I think doki bird...

1538
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,760

1539
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:58,640
She's pretty slay.

01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,780

01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,520
Who the fuck is this girl?

1549
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,100
You're- You're- Are you trying to say women are a myth?

1550
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:47,480
Like, are you trying to say women are- What are you?

1551
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,640
You're just women.

1552
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:50,540
You're just women.

1553
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:50,740
Women.

1554
01:03:55,970 --> 01:03:56,730
Yeah!

1555
01:03:57,850 --> 01:03:59,250
Oh shit.

1556
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:04,770
Like, I- I robbed- Okay, to be fair, I definitely robbed Medusa.

1557
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:11,850
I def- I definitely- I definitely robbed her from the wind.

1558
01:04:12,190 --> 01:04:17,790
I def- The biggest upset of the century.

1559
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:21,210
You did not deserve this.

1560
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:25,310
Oh my god.

1561
01:04:25,550 --> 01:04:26,950
Oh my god.

1562
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:30,410
I definitely did not deserve this win.

1563
01:04:30,790 --> 01:04:32,170
Alright, Farmer.

1564
01:04:33,850 --> 01:04:35,510
Not enough theme props?

1565
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:36,450
What do you mean?

1566
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:39,750
Oh, I need a buy to decide the theme?

1567
01:04:39,930 --> 01:04:41,670
The rich really do decide the world.

1568
01:04:41,890 --> 01:04:45,990
The rich- The rich yet again.

1569
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:50,110
Yet again.

1570
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:51,190
Props.

1571
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:52,090
The rich runs this world.

1572
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:55,350
Oh my god.

1573
01:04:55,390 --> 01:04:56,950
Somebody put Farmer in there!

1574
01:04:57,110 --> 01:05:02,350
Somebody pay to put Farmer in the fucking category chat.

1575
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:05,130
What the fuck is this?

1576
01:05:05,130 --> 01:05:05,770
Is this parkour?

1577
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:07,550
The theme is sci-fi.

1578
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:08,250
Shit.

1579
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:10,410
Where the fuck do I be in sci-fi?

1580
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:12,830
No, I'm not.

1581
01:05:12,890 --> 01:05:13,650
I don't feel ready.

1582
01:05:16,090 --> 01:05:16,650
Um...

1583
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:18,290
Oh no.

1584
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:23,330
Where do I be in sci-fi?

1585
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:24,850
What would be...

1586
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:28,110
Star Trek?

1587
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:30,950
These children don't know what the fuck is Star Trek!

1588
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:31,970
You know what?

1589
01:05:34,590 --> 01:05:35,530
Is Miku...

1590
01:05:35,530 --> 01:05:37,670
Wait, Miku Hatsune is technically sci-fi.

1591
01:05:41,350 --> 01:05:42,370
You think...

1592
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:43,530
Is Miku sci-fi?

1593
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:44,610
Is she sci-fi?

1594
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:45,930
You know what?

1595
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:48,190
Wait, you're gonna be Miku?

1596
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:49,770
Bitch.

1597
01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:51,710
Take that shit off right now.

1598
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:52,470
You're not gonna be Miku.

1599
01:05:52,590 --> 01:05:53,730
I'm gonna be Miku.

1600
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:57,370
Girl, I was here first and I'm gonna be Miku.

1601
01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:00,470
That's right.

1602
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:01,770
That's...

1603
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:02,510
Turn around.

1604
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:04,170
Turn around right now.

1605
01:06:04,810 --> 01:06:05,890
That's fucking right.

1606
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:06,610
Know your place.

1607
01:06:06,850 --> 01:06:08,790
Know your goddamn place, child.

1608
01:06:09,170 --> 01:06:09,890
Know your...

1609
01:06:14,830 --> 01:06:16,010
That's so cute, right?

1610
01:06:16,330 --> 01:06:18,130
That's good that she knew her place.

1611
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:18,870
That's...

1612
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:20,710
That's the...

1613
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:24,690
That's the actual fashion drama.

1614
01:06:26,830 --> 01:06:28,950
I am a rising star in the...

1615
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:33,550
I will be the one then.

1616
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:34,950
That's right.

1617
01:06:37,050 --> 01:06:37,570
Alright.

1618
01:06:37,590 --> 01:06:37,710
Alright.

1619
01:06:37,710 --> 01:06:38,370
Let's see.

1620
01:06:39,310 --> 01:06:40,350
Okay, there we go.

1621
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:41,510
We got the right colors.

1622
01:06:43,090 --> 01:06:44,130
And then...

1623
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:46,170
Oh wait, that has to be black so...

1624
01:06:46,730 --> 01:06:47,270
There we go.

1625
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:48,950
Alright.

1626
01:06:48,950 --> 01:06:50,530
But... that's right.

1627
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:54,530
And then... we're gonna have to get the hair.

1628
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:57,470
We're gonna grab the hair here.

1629
01:06:57,790 --> 01:06:59,570
I'm not gonna socialize with the...

1630
01:06:59,570 --> 01:07:01,330
with those beneath me right now.

1631
01:07:01,470 --> 01:07:02,430
Like, I'm a star.

1632
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:06,950
I'm a goddamn fucking star.

1633
01:07:07,070 --> 01:07:08,170
I'm not gonna socialize...

1634
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:10,470
with those that are beneath my existence.

1635
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:13,390
Wait, where's the Miku hair?

1636
01:07:14,550 --> 01:07:15,770
Where's the Miku hair?

1637
01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:17,530
Wait...

1638
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:19,870
Where's the Miku hair?

1639
01:07:21,710 --> 01:07:22,730
Where is it?

1640
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:27,330
She literally had Miku hair.

1641
01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:30,230
It's from my code?

1642
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:31,470
What's the code, guys?

1643
01:07:31,770 --> 01:07:32,990
Guys, what's the code?

1644
01:07:33,030 --> 01:07:34,130
I need the code.

1645
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:36,230
I can't live without it.

1646
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:37,690
How do I...

1647
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:40,750
Guys...

1648
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:42,030
What's the code?

1649
01:07:42,510 --> 01:07:44,030
Guys, we have two...

1650
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:45,070
We have two...

1651
01:07:45,710 --> 01:07:46,310
There's...

1652
01:07:46,310 --> 01:07:47,630
What's the code?

1653
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:48,610
There's a code.

1654
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:50,010
The code is four.

1655
01:07:51,130 --> 01:07:53,570
Guys, we need the Miku hair.

1656
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:55,370
It's not boobs.

1657
01:07:58,290 --> 01:08:00,190
I Bella slay.

1658
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:00,790
Okay.

1659
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:02,550
That's not numbers.

1660
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:04,750
That's an invalid code.

1661
01:08:05,310 --> 01:08:06,810
Oh, is it all... Is it L?

1662
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:09,790
L Bella slay.

1663
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:11,530
Is it L?

1664
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:12,870
Oh, is it I?

1665
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:13,610
I.

1666
01:08:14,330 --> 01:08:15,570
Oh my god.

1667
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:18,070
Slay.

1668
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:18,950
Okay.

1669
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:23,780
Come on.

1670
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:24,360
Come on.

1671
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,160
Miku hair color.

1672
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:27,880
Come on.

1673
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:30,120
There we go.

1674
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:31,880
I am sci-fi.

1675
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:33,780
Miku is sci-fi.

1676
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:34,600
Okay, we're gonna...

1677
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,700
We're giving Miku some sci...

1678
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:38,320
You know, I can pick whatever the fuck I want.

1679
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:40,700
I own this... I own this fashion industry.

1680
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:44,980
I... Like, I've never changed my makeup at all.

1681
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:46,280
I've never...

1682
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:49,460
I haven't changed my makeup at all throughout the year.

1683
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:50,360
But this, like...

1684
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:51,000
I just...

1685
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,320
I just kept this on since...

1686
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:57,480
Since the very start.

1687
01:08:58,720 --> 01:08:59,280
Okay.

1688
01:08:59,420 --> 01:08:59,840
Let's see.

1689
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:01,980
I could be Vampire Miku.

1690
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:04,140
Oh my god.

1691
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,560
I'm gonna be Vampire Miku.

1692
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:10,060
Mewing.

1693
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:10,880
I'm gonna be...

1694
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:15,380
I'm gonna...

1695
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:16,260
I'm gonna...

1696
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:17,740
I'm mewing right now.

1697
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:20,580
Now I'm viewing Miku.

1698
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:25,960
This is the time I'm viewing Miku.

1699
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,660
Alright, let's see.

1700
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:30,280
And then get the microphone.

1701
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,080
There we go.

1702
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:34,360
Hatsune Miku.

1703
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:35,800
Yes!

1704
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:38,800
Yes, children!

1705
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:41,460
I'm Hatsune Miku!

1706
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,260
That's right, children.

1707
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:49,000
Oh my gosh, she's the angel from Doctor Who!

1708
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:54,200
I can't believe you guys were like, these children will never recognize Star Trek.

1709
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:58,280
They'll just be like, they literally was like, who the fuck is Jackie?

1710
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:02,760
They don't even know who Jackie was.

1711
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:07,240
They saw Michelle Obama and was like, oh I know her.

1712
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,740
And then everybody else was like, who the fuck is she?

1713
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:12,620
What is that?

1714
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,280
That's not even sci-fi.

1715
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:15,400
What are you?

1716
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:16,080
God.

1717
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:18,760
Is this why you do not have VIP?

1718
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:19,960
That's right.

1719
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:24,220
Um, it's Hatsune Miku.

1720
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,540
Get it right, girl.

1721
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:31,540
Like, oh my god.

1722
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:33,560
Get it right.

1723
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:37,680
Is that Shaggy?

1724
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:38,780
Miku?

1725
01:10:46,630 --> 01:10:48,850
I'm Hatsune Miku.

1726
01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:50,650
Hahaha.

1727
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:52,990
Hahaha.

1728
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:55,770
It's giving.

1729
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:57,070
Oh my god.

1730
01:10:57,130 --> 01:11:00,310
That face is giving five stars.

1731
01:11:00,570 --> 01:11:01,890
So good!

1732
01:11:02,110 --> 01:11:03,650
Thank you, darlings.

1733
01:11:03,730 --> 01:11:04,570
Thank you.

1734
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:07,870
I love it.

1735
01:11:08,070 --> 01:11:08,850
Slay.

1736
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:11,870
That phone.

1737
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:13,690
No, I forgot to pose!

1738
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:16,630
I keep forgetting to pose!

1739
01:11:17,230 --> 01:11:19,490
I got so absorbed.

1740
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:22,590
I don't need to pose.

1741
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:24,730
I own the industry.

1742
01:11:25,390 --> 01:11:26,090
Ladies.

1743
01:11:28,650 --> 01:11:29,610
Who's that?

1744
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:33,870
Is this a... who's that?

1745
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:35,890
Who the fuck is that?

1746
01:11:36,150 --> 01:11:37,770
I don't know what this is.

1747
01:11:40,350 --> 01:11:42,110
Don't need a pose.

1748
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:50,260
All my sides are my good side.

1749
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:51,760
Wait, oh my god!

1750
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:54,640
Five stars though.

1751
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:55,500
Five stars.

1752
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,340
Guys, give Jay five stars.

1753
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:58,540
That is beautiful.

1754
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:00,160
No way!

1755
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:01,680
Is that...

1756
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:04,080
Is that sci-fi doki bird?

1757
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:10,160
Guys, you better... Oh!

1758
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:12,000
E from Wall-E!

1759
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:13,500
That was an attempt.

1760
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,080
I don't know.

1761
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:21,140
You're just not me.

1762
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:24,260
You're just... it's... it's... you're just not me.

1763
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:25,380
Like, I don't know.

1764
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:31,260
That's actually... Oh, wait!

1765
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,220
That's actually pretty good.

1766
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:35,040
That's... you know what?

1767
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:38,440
With every Hatsune Miku needs a Lenn.

1768
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:40,360
So you get... you get a four star.

1769
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,320
You get a four star.

1770
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:44,340
She thought she was her.

1771
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:48,780
What the fuck is that?

1772
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:50,160
Is that actually Shaggy?

1773
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:53,040
Chat, is this Rin?

1774
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:01,080
I'm separate timelines instead of VTubing.

1775
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:03,880
I became a bioengineer.

1776
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:04,800
I didn't even vote.

1777
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:06,840
That's how fucked it was.

1778
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:08,900
I hate green Shaggy.

1779
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:10,040
Who's that?

1780
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:11,820
I'm Wall-E.

1781
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:12,440
Oh!

1782
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:15,200
You're Wall-E!

1783
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:15,940
One star.

1784
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:21,280
I didn't know until you said you're Wall-E.

1785
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,460
So, like, I don't know.

1786
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:28,320
It had to be very... It has to be, like, very obvious to me that you're Wall-E.

1787
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,760
If you have to tell me you're Wall-E, then it's not good enough.

1788
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:32,620
I'm sorry, darling.

1789
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:33,740
It's just not good enough.

1790
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:35,360
I'm sorry, darling.

1791
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:39,160
It's just... mmm... You just need to try a little bit more.

1792
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:40,020
I'm sorry, darling.

1793
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:40,020
It's just...

1794
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:40,020
mmm...

1795
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:40,020
You just need to try a little bit more.

1796
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:42,580
I am...

1797
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:43,140
I am...

1798
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:46,800
Is that Tom Cruise?

1799
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:50,300
Wait, who's this?

1800
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:56,640
Is that cosplaying as a scientific tomato?

1801
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:59,900
T-star.

1802
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:02,000
Scientific experiment.

1803
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:03,140
Cute.

1804
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:07,040
If the tomato can be... No, a tomato.

1805
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:15,940
If the tomato can be a fashion model, what will it look like?

1806
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:16,780
What are you?

1807
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:17,460
I don't know.

1808
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:18,740
I just did... Okay, one star.

1809
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:19,700
You didn't even try.

1810
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:23,540
You're a runway queen and you didn't even try?

1811
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:27,980
God, whose daddy helped you get here at the top?

1812
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:36,640
Somebody clearly used daddy's money to get here.

1813
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:40,220
Get out.

1814
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:41,120
What the fuck?

1815
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:43,440
This bit is really good.

1816
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:44,480
Slay.

1817
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:50,920
That person was AFK.

1818
01:14:51,380 --> 01:14:52,900
Alright, the winners are...

1819
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:55,220
YAAAAAAAAY!

1820
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:57,800
Hatsune Miku!

1821
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:01,980
I think I fucked up this lobby.

1822
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:05,500
Guys, I'm pretty sure I messed up the lobby, guys.

1823
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:06,580
Take a photo!

1824
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:07,660
Take photos!

1825
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:08,780
Oh my gosh.

1826
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,300
Come on, paparazzi.

1827
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:14,380
Go over here and take some photos of my true rifle plays here.

1828
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:15,360
Don't worry.

1829
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:17,500
I might not have posed... Oh, yeah.

1830
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:19,520
That's right.

1831
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:23,900
That's right, everybody.

1832
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:25,380
Oooh.

1833
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:28,180
Yeah.

1834
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:31,520
That's right.

1835
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:32,580
Do pose 12.

1836
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:33,400
What's pose 12?

1837
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:34,960
Is this?

1838
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:37,380
Is this?

1839
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:39,780
Is this a JoJo pose?

1840
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,320
Is this a JoJo pose?

1841
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:45,680
Alright.

1842
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:47,240
Alright, guys.

1843
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:48,440
Wow.

1844
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:49,560
Guys, I'm a natural.

1845
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:51,620
I'm actually a natural at this.

1846
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,820
Now I know why Kesa was obsessed with this.

1847
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,700
Wait, I can join the...

1848
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:59,940
Oh, I can join the VIP exclusive servers?

1849
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:00,860
Oh, guys.

1850
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:02,680
I need a real challenge, everybody.

1851
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:03,920
I...

1852
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,180
I need a real challenge.

1853
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:14,080
I think as a rising star that I made it in this world to go the next level.

1854
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:18,720
Okay.

1855
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:22,220
Elements.

1856
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:22,880
Oh, God.

1857
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:23,940
Wait, elements.

1858
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:24,340
Okay.

1859
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:28,260
Go to... Oh, they're fire.

1860
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:29,820
Okay, if they're gonna be fire, I'm gonna be water.

1861
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:30,900
I'm gonna be water.

1862
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:32,740
I'm thinking quick right now.

1863
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:33,900
I'll be water.

1864
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:34,720
Alright.

1865
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:37,920
Guys.

1866
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:40,660
I'm sorry, but like clearly...

1867
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:43,880
Clearly, I deserve to be here.

1868
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:48,260
Because I got so many wins, guys.

1869
01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:49,460
So, I mean...

1870
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:53,020
All I'm saying is that I am...

1871
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:55,400
I think I am ready to be in the big leagues.

1872
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:57,920
I'm ready to be in the big leagues now.

1873
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:58,840
Hahaha.

1874
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:01,400
Oh, yes.

1875
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:02,680
Okay, we're gonna...

1876
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:04,400
Oh, yes.

1877
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:04,840
Alright.

1878
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:07,220
We're gonna be the element of water.

1879
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:09,800
Oh, okay.

1880
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:11,720
Let's see.

1881
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,120
What is good?

1882
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:14,600
What is good?

1883
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:15,780
Or should I have a body suit?

1884
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:17,400
Wait, should I have this on?

1885
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:19,280
Oh, I don't know.

1886
01:17:19,420 --> 01:17:19,780
I don't know.

1887
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:20,320
Let me...

1888
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,920
Doing our Gucci villain arc.

1889
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,580
No, I feel like...

1890
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:27,360
Since like...

1891
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:28,100
Wait, how...

1892
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:28,820
How are they doing this?

1893
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:29,920
Why are they like mermaids?

1894
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:31,720
You guys saw that, right?

1895
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,760
They were like mermaids at one point.

1896
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:36,100
Like, how are they mermaids?

1897
01:17:39,550 --> 01:17:40,110
Let's see.

1898
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:40,550
Nope.

1899
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:41,950
Uh...

1900
01:17:41,950 --> 01:17:43,730
God, we'll be a good fit.

1901
01:17:43,970 --> 01:17:44,290
Ooh.

1902
01:17:44,890 --> 01:17:45,330
Ooh.

1903
01:17:45,910 --> 01:17:46,350
Yes.

1904
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:47,250
Yes.

1905
01:17:48,450 --> 01:17:48,890
Oh!

1906
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:50,330
Oh, my God.

1907
01:17:50,370 --> 01:17:50,530
Yes!

1908
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:52,210
Code?

1909
01:17:52,410 --> 01:17:53,530
Guys, we need to be a mermaid.

1910
01:17:54,030 --> 01:17:55,370
Guys, we're literally...

1911
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:56,350
Code, give me the code.

1912
01:17:56,430 --> 01:17:57,750
Guys, we gotta win this.

1913
01:17:57,930 --> 01:17:59,930
We gotta beat these guys.

1914
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:00,270
Guys, we gotta beat these guys.

1915
01:18:00,290 --> 01:18:01,990
We're in the big leagues, girls.

1916
01:18:02,430 --> 01:18:04,690
We're in the big leagues.

1917
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:09,070
Mermaid.

1918
01:18:10,230 --> 01:18:11,530
All right.

1919
01:18:12,130 --> 01:18:13,550
Oh, my God.

1920
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:14,070
Yes.

1921
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:16,950
Oh, my God.

1922
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:18,930
Oh, you're gonna...

1923
01:18:18,930 --> 01:18:21,630
You're gonna beat this competition, doki.

1924
01:18:21,810 --> 01:18:23,030
Oh, my God.

1925
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:23,730
Like...

1926
01:18:26,690 --> 01:18:28,390
They don't know what's coming.

1927
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:29,610
Oh, my God.

1928
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:30,270
Oh, my God.

1929
01:18:30,290 --> 01:18:41,830
Guys, we gotta grab this hex code and then change this to this and then change this to this.

1930
01:18:42,530 --> 01:18:43,430
There we go.

1931
01:18:43,730 --> 01:18:44,570
Wait, what?

1932
01:18:44,990 --> 01:18:46,330
This is not the code?

1933
01:18:46,670 --> 01:18:47,430
Oh, there we go.

1934
01:18:48,030 --> 01:18:50,010
Oh, my God.

1935
01:18:50,370 --> 01:18:51,450
You are so...

1936
01:18:51,450 --> 01:18:51,910
You're ready.

1937
01:18:52,030 --> 01:18:53,170
You're so ready, doki.

1938
01:18:53,390 --> 01:18:54,550
You have to think.

1939
01:18:54,690 --> 01:18:58,950
An hour ago, you were just beneath them.

1940
01:18:59,050 --> 01:19:00,270
And look at this.

1941
01:19:00,270 --> 01:19:01,250
Look at you now, girl!

1942
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:09,190
Oh, my God.

1943
01:19:09,290 --> 01:19:10,030
It is possible.

1944
01:19:10,230 --> 01:19:12,470
Anybody can be a star.

1945
01:19:16,230 --> 01:19:20,090
Anybody can be a star if you just try hard enough.

1946
01:19:20,370 --> 01:19:21,390
And if you...

1947
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:22,410
If you can't...

1948
01:19:22,410 --> 01:19:23,570
You were just weren't trying.

1949
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:26,450
Let's see.

1950
01:19:27,330 --> 01:19:28,130
All right.

1951
01:19:28,210 --> 01:19:30,130
He wants to try.

1952
01:19:30,130 --> 01:19:31,550
You just weren't giving your all.

1953
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:32,790
That's all I'm saying.

1954
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:34,930
You can't make it here.

1955
01:19:35,050 --> 01:19:36,350
You weren't trying your best.

1956
01:19:36,570 --> 01:19:37,450
What is this?

1957
01:19:38,810 --> 01:19:39,890
Oh yes!

1958
01:19:40,010 --> 01:19:40,810
It's like seaweed!

1959
01:19:41,190 --> 01:19:42,610
I can make this like seaweed!

1960
01:19:43,190 --> 01:19:44,390
Oh my god!

1961
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:45,150
Yes!

1962
01:19:45,330 --> 01:19:45,710
Okay.

1963
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:47,930
Alright.

1964
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:49,890
Oh my god.

1965
01:19:49,930 --> 01:19:50,910
It's like nature.

1966
01:19:51,190 --> 01:19:52,010
Oh my god.

1967
01:19:53,290 --> 01:19:55,250
God, how do you keep doing this?

1968
01:19:55,990 --> 01:19:58,270
How are you just so good?

1969
01:19:58,270 --> 01:19:59,410
Oh my god.

1970
01:19:59,410 --> 01:19:59,930
Wait, this works.

1971
01:20:00,110 --> 01:20:01,550
Wait, this actually works.

1972
01:20:01,970 --> 01:20:04,330
How are you just... Oh my gosh, Doki.

1973
01:20:04,490 --> 01:20:05,950
You're literally a natural at this.

1974
01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:08,710
I'm trying to figure out if I want this fit.

1975
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:11,090
Like the dress with the...

1976
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:14,310
Oh, but maybe if I put a belt on it?

1977
01:20:14,370 --> 01:20:15,850
Like if I put a belt on top?

1978
01:20:16,230 --> 01:20:17,290
And then...

1979
01:20:18,490 --> 01:20:20,270
Oh no, the belt doesn't...

1980
01:20:22,570 --> 01:20:24,690
The belt... Oh, I can make it bigger?

1981
01:20:26,770 --> 01:20:27,890
Wait, how do I...

1982
01:20:28,870 --> 01:20:30,150
Is that not the belt?

1983
01:20:30,590 --> 01:20:31,430
Where is it?

1984
01:20:33,010 --> 01:20:33,970
No, I can't.

1985
01:20:33,970 --> 01:20:34,910
I can't fit the belt.

1986
01:20:35,450 --> 01:20:36,410
Oh my god.

1987
01:20:37,630 --> 01:20:38,350
Let's see.

1988
01:20:40,110 --> 01:20:41,570
That's what you're going in?

1989
01:20:41,890 --> 01:20:43,390
It's called elements, girl.

1990
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:44,650
What element are you?

1991
01:20:44,930 --> 01:20:46,570
The element of shit?

1992
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:54,000
You might as well leave now.

1993
01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:56,880
Don't even bother going to the judging panel.

1994
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:01,160
Wow.

1995
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:02,460
You are so rude.

1996
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:03,900
Okay.

1997
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:07,940
That's when I know I am in the big leagues.

1998
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,200
Oh my God.

1999
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:11,820
You can tell.

2000
01:21:13,940 --> 01:21:16,060
Doki, these are children.

2001
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:23,600
Age doesn't matter in the world of fashion.

2002
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:26,240
You either have it or you don't.

2003
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:30,760
One star.

2004
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:31,920
What element are you?

2005
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,560
Are you trendsetter?

2006
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:36,300
More like go home.

2007
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,640
What even is this?

2008
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:42,060
The element of lady.

2009
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:44,700
What element is this?

2010
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:48,720
Oh, that's fire?

2011
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:52,520
But I know this is from... I don't know.

2012
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:53,260
Fire.

2013
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,440
More like go homer.

2014
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:03,700
What is this?

2015
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:04,500
Is this nature?

2016
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:06,320
Is this nature?

2017
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:09,760
Girl, look at color theory.

2018
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:14,520
Go back to school to figure out what color theory is.

2019
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:23,800
More like belongs in the trash.

2020
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:28,400
Oh, and that's how you do Earth, Bella!

2021
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:31,320
Maybe you should go back to the free section.

2022
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:34,860
Oh, that's how you do Earth, girl.

2023
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:36,320
Yes!

2024
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:37,600
Slay!

2025
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:38,560
Fire!

2026
01:22:39,330 --> 01:22:40,540
Can we get some snaps?

2027
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:46,800
Now that's an Earth element.

2028
01:22:48,860 --> 01:22:50,480
That's really good.

2029
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:51,200
What the fuck is this?

2030
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,460
Water and fire?

2031
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:53,380
No.

2032
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:55,220
Do not mix.

2033
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,780
Water and fire don't go together.

2034
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,480
Oh, they're talking about elements.

2035
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:01,900
Okay.

2036
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,660
But what about elemental dokey?

2037
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:05,980
That's a children's film.

2038
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:07,400
Water.

2039
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:15,580
That's all I'm gonna write.

2040
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:16,500
Water.

2041
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:21,320
No.

2042
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:22,540
No, I forgot to pause!

2043
01:23:23,060 --> 01:23:25,360
I keep forgetting to pause!

2044
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:27,880
What is... Snow is not an element!

2045
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:30,620
You wish it was an element!

2046
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:32,800
Have you never played Pokemon before?

2047
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:34,040
Fire!

2048
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,180
Wa... Oh, wait.

2049
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:36,520
It's ice!

2050
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:38,260
Snow is not ice!

2051
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:41,080
It's just water.

2052
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:43,820
Snow isn't an element.

2053
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:45,900
That's not even ice!

2054
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:47,960
That's air?!

2055
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:49,580
I'm third?!

2056
01:23:49,580 --> 01:23:51,840
That bitch is not even air!

2057
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:59,400
How can you tell it's air?!

2058
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,560
Fucking clowns!

2059
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:12,820
The first thing I see is like not... God, this lobby is so beneath me.

2060
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,400
They cannot see real talent.

2061
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:21,980
No!

2062
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:23,780
I'm not Pro-X!

2063
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:25,520
How many points do I have?!

2064
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:29,300
How many... How many points do I have?!

2065
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:30,660
I...

2066
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,380
Snow is not...

2067
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:35,560
That's truly a streamer...

2068
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:38,160
How do I... How many points do I have?!

2069
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:40,560
I have a hundred and sixty f... Can you gift stars?

2070
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:42,120
Or do you have to grind that shit out?

2071
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,500
Yeah, that's what you deserve.

2072
01:24:44,740 --> 01:24:47,840
I wanna... I wanna be in the big leagues.

2073
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,340
These bitches don't deserve me.

2074
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:55,760
I got third place, chat.

2075
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:58,720
I got third... from first place.

2076
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:00,320
Favorite aesthetic?

2077
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:04,500
What a garbage fucking... I'm doing another snow.

2078
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:06,160
Fuck this server.

2079
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:07,620
What a garbage element.

2080
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:16,660
That's not even like... um... That's not even a real theme.

2081
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:17,880
Oh my god!

2082
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:19,360
Get me outta here!

2083
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:21,900
This theme fucking sucks!

2084
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:23,320
Get me outta here!

2085
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:27,560
This is... third is not... third...

2086
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:28,840
That's a non-theme.

2087
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:30,860
That's literally a cop-out.

2088
01:25:31,820 --> 01:25:33,640
I need a real challenge.

2089
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:37,980
It's still favorite aesthetic?!

2090
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:40,800
Am I... There's only one server?!

2091
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:47,500
Tell me when this aesthetic is over.

2092
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,140
I can't... I can't deal with that.

2093
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:54,400
I can't deal with people giving like... um... I... It can be anything, Zine.

2094
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:55,920
That's not... You either...

2095
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:58,120
You gotta go hard or go home.

2096
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:04,380
You can't just be like... um... I like any... Minimalist versus maximalist.

2097
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,100
What the fuck is that?

2098
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:06,580
The...

2099
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,840
Just don't fucking put on anything.

2100
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:11,600
Like what?

2101
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:13,640
Oh... wait.

2102
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:15,840
Wait, I have an idea.

2103
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:17,060
I have an idea.

2104
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:17,860
Okay, okay.

2105
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:20,520
Where... where is... there we go.

2106
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:24,220
Wait, can I change?

2107
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:25,640
No!

2108
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:26,580
No, I can't!

2109
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:27,800
I don't have any clothes on.

2110
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:33,860
Alright, where's like the... where's like the... the... the... I'm cooking.

2111
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,060
I'm cooking.

2112
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:36,360
I'm cooking something right now.

2113
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:38,200
I need like the shortest thing they have.

2114
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,600
So I can do something silly.

2115
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:43,680
I need something... I need like a bikini.

2116
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:44,500
Where's the...

2117
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:48,340
Oh, yes!

2118
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,780
Okay, what... what color is this?

2119
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:52,960
I can color match this, guys.

2120
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:53,660
I can do it.

2121
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:57,740
I can color match this.

2122
01:26:58,240 --> 01:26:59,540
Guys, it'll be easy.

2123
01:26:59,580 --> 01:26:59,780
Yeah.

2124
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:05,040
Oh, God.

2125
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:08,540
I'll spend the entire time color matching this until I got... get it perfect.

2126
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:10,960
I... uh...

2127
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:14,320
What the fuck is that?

2128
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:17,600
Okay, wait.

2129
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,080
It's almost there.

2130
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:22,800
We're almost there.

2131
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:26,780
We're almost there, guys.

2132
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:28,240
We're almost there, guys.

2133
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:31,740
Okay, there you go.

2134
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,360
That's the best I can do.

2135
01:27:34,660 --> 01:27:36,060
Okay, we need like...

2136
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:41,180
It's like minimalist!

2137
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:46,700
I'm literally... I'm giving the minimalist look right now!

2138
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:50,240
What do you want from me?

2139
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:54,000
Literally minimalist, chat.

2140
01:27:54,420 --> 01:27:58,380
I'm doing my best here to give you nothing.

2141
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:02,020
No, God, don't give us nothing!

2142
01:28:06,460 --> 01:28:11,500
If they didn't want me to do all of that, I... they would have taken that theme out.

2143
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:12,040
Like...

2144
01:28:15,580 --> 01:28:19,240
If they didn't want this, this would not be a theme.

2145
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:22,940
They know damn well how... what's gonna happen.

2146
01:28:23,220 --> 01:28:26,680
They know damn well what would happen.

2147
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:30,040
Alright, let's see.

2148
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:32,240
Need like...

2149
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:34,080
What do you give us?

2150
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:39,340
That is... it's so minimal!

2151
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:42,040
How is this not minimalist?

2152
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:50,920
How do they have a fucking bra, but no... no like... I don't know, shorts or tights or like... uh... bikini bottoms?

2153
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:54,900
Alright, let's see.

2154
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:57,680
I mean, this is the closest we have.

2155
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:00,200
This is literally... there we go.

2156
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:02,480
Oh wait, this is a better...

2157
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:04,600
Wait, I think this is better.

2158
01:29:04,780 --> 01:29:06,140
Like the source code for this.

2159
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:11,300
Okay, uh...

2160
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:14,580
Wait, I should really like this.

2161
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:16,200
Wait, what?

2162
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:18,380
Oh, that's the wrong one.

2163
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,500
Oh no, I still have time, I still have time.

2164
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:22,340
That's the wrong one.

2165
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:23,120
This is it.

2166
01:29:27,230 --> 01:29:29,070
No, I keep pressing the wrong one!

2167
01:29:32,630 --> 01:29:33,270
What?

2168
01:29:35,730 --> 01:29:36,370
No.

2169
01:29:36,530 --> 01:29:38,170
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2170
01:29:42,690 --> 01:29:43,530
There we go.

2171
01:29:44,270 --> 01:29:45,110
Yes, girl.

2172
01:29:51,380 --> 01:29:56,260
It's literally... they literally said... no, they said minimalist.

2173
01:29:57,220 --> 01:29:58,780
I'm giving you nothing.

2174
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:04,400
How am I supposed to know this?

2175
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:04,880
How am I losing?

2176
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:06,720
This is perfect!

2177
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:09,720
This is as minimal as you can get!

2178
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:11,820
I don't understand how this is a loss.

2179
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:14,020
This is literally as minimal...

2180
01:30:14,020 --> 01:30:15,560
Okay, okay, fine, fine, fine, fine.

2181
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:22,660
There, at least... at least I have shoes on.

2182
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:29,800
There we go.

2183
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:32,020
This is as minimal as you can get.

2184
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:33,200
There we go.

2185
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:34,920
There's no way.

2186
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:36,120
There's no way!

2187
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:39,000
This is literally as minimal as you can get!

2188
01:30:39,660 --> 01:30:42,820
My fashion sense is so ahead of its time.

2189
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:44,100
You guys just don't understand.

2190
01:30:44,860 --> 01:30:47,100
Guys, you're not a trendsetter like me.

2191
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:48,860
Is this ethical?

2192
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:51,140
What do you mean?

2193
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:53,480
Laffy, thank you for the super chat.

2194
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:54,520
Thank you, thank you.

2195
01:30:54,660 --> 01:30:55,720
Is it true?

2196
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:57,720
It's like minimalist logos.

2197
01:30:58,060 --> 01:30:59,200
It's literally it.

2198
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,940
They said maximalist and I took it personally.

2199
01:31:04,940 --> 01:31:06,540
I don't know.

2200
01:31:06,860 --> 01:31:07,320
Like...

2201
01:31:07,940 --> 01:31:09,800
The colors look terrible.

2202
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:11,680
I hate the colors.

2203
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:14,220
That's just my opinion though.

2204
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:21,560
You may not be ready for it, but your kids are gonna love it.

2205
01:31:21,980 --> 01:31:22,300
Oh!

2206
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:24,520
Okay.

2207
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:26,380
Oh my god!

2208
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:28,360
And she's showing what she's got.

2209
01:31:32,180 --> 01:31:32,860
Damn!

2210
01:31:33,140 --> 01:31:34,800
She ain't no lady.

2211
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:35,780
That's for sure.

2212
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:38,500
Okay, my posing will save me.

2213
01:31:39,980 --> 01:31:41,120
Oh, wait.

2214
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:43,200
I do love...

2215
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:44,020
I do...

2216
01:31:44,020 --> 01:31:45,680
I do like...

2217
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:47,020
Wait, you can have an umbrella?

2218
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:48,820
Where did she get the umbrella?

2219
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:50,220
Where did...

2220
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:52,880
She's serving right now.

2221
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:53,960
She's ser...

2222
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:54,340
What is it?

2223
01:31:54,340 --> 01:31:55,320
She's serving cunt?

2224
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:58,880
Is that what they call it?

2225
01:31:59,020 --> 01:32:01,520
Is that what they call it in the fashion industry?

2226
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:02,640
Okay.

2227
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:03,120
Yeah.

2228
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:16,660
That's why I said no.

2229
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:17,040
Okay.

2230
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:20,140
She's serving cunt.

2231
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:20,420
I don't know why.

2232
01:32:20,420 --> 01:32:20,740
I did...

2233
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:21,480
Okay.

2234
01:32:22,220 --> 01:32:22,400
Okay.

2235
01:32:22,660 --> 01:32:24,040
And this is...

2236
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:24,100
She's so soft.

2237
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:30,060
Okay.

2238
01:32:30,060 --> 01:32:30,460
Okay.

2239
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:30,480
Okay.

2240
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:30,500
Okay.

2241
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:31,860
Okay.

2242
01:32:31,940 --> 01:32:31,960
Okay.

2243
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:32,200
Okay.

2244
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:33,600
No, you don't deserve to start.

2245
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:34,540
I got distracted there.

2246
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:45,880
Oh my god, that is the most... oh my god, that is so maximalist.

2247
01:32:46,100 --> 01:32:48,960
She should go to jail for this.

2248
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:54,880
She should go to jail.

2249
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:00,380
All right, is it my turn?

2250
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:01,380
What is it?

2251
01:33:01,380 --> 01:33:02,360
Miss America.

2252
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:04,600
Holy shit, what a fucking name.

2253
01:33:05,780 --> 01:33:06,900
Miss Americana.

2254
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:10,300
One star.

2255
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:11,420
How is that minimal?

2256
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:14,320
You're just a woman, like with headphones on.

2257
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:15,920
How is that minimalist?

2258
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:20,940
That's right.

2259
01:33:21,860 --> 01:33:28,100
As minimal as you can get, girl.

2260
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:36,160
Now this is minimalist.

2261
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,020
No way.

2262
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:49,380
I'm mannequin chic right now.

2263
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:54,600
No pose...

2264
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:56,780
Exactly... if I'm gonna be minimal...

2265
01:33:57,150 --> 01:33:59,060
We don't even pose...

2266
01:33:59,770 --> 01:34:00,980
That was on purpose.

2267
01:34:03,010 --> 01:34:03,420
YEAH!

2268
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:05,180
WE ARE INSPIRED!

2269
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:10,920
Guys, take a photo.

2270
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:13,280
Oh my god.

2271
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:15,680
Oh my god.

2272
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:18,120
Let's go.

2273
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:20,040
That's it, guys.

2274
01:34:20,220 --> 01:34:20,920
Take some photos.

2275
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:20,920
Okay?

2276
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:22,320
Snapshots guys, come on.

2277
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:23,780
Take all these.

2278
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:25,780
I'm gonna do a mannequin posing for you.

2279
01:34:25,820 --> 01:34:26,400
Oh yeah.

2280
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:28,120
Yeah girl!

2281
01:34:28,660 --> 01:34:30,380
Spread those legs!

2282
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:40,740
Spread those legs and...

2283
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:43,680
She cut.

2284
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:48,780
Holy shit.

2285
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:51,160
Okay let's go back to the...

2286
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:52,040
Let's go back.

2287
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:53,460
I'm done with you guys.

2288
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:54,780
You guys are too easy.

2289
01:34:56,920 --> 01:35:01,080
You guys are too fucking easy.

2290
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:03,080
I'm going back to my VIP lounge.

2291
01:35:07,580 --> 01:35:08,100
I'm sorry.

2292
01:35:09,740 --> 01:35:10,640
You're not a challenge.

2293
01:35:10,740 --> 01:35:11,360
Children.

2294
01:35:11,940 --> 01:35:14,840
I need to go where...

2295
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:16,320
I know my talents...

2296
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:17,440
will be appreciated.

2297
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,080
Childhood dream?

2298
01:35:20,620 --> 01:35:21,660
Oh okay.

2299
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:22,660
Childhood dream.

2300
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:26,040
She's still serving it.

2301
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:28,560
Alright.

2302
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:29,460
Childhood dream.

2303
01:35:29,700 --> 01:35:31,300
I know there's a balloon.

2304
01:35:31,660 --> 01:35:32,940
What's my childhood dream?

2305
01:35:34,420 --> 01:35:36,020
Guys we gotta mix shit up.

2306
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:39,920
Like reality TV.

2307
01:35:41,180 --> 01:35:42,040
Nothing is real.

2308
01:35:43,460 --> 01:35:45,180
Who entered that fashion?

2309
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:46,440
What do you mean?

2310
01:35:46,780 --> 01:35:49,340
That's as minimal as you can fucking get.

2311
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:51,060
How dare you.

2312
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:55,000
My childhood dream...

2313
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,580
is to be a rabbit.

2314
01:35:56,820 --> 01:35:58,240
I don't fucking know.

2315
01:35:58,960 --> 01:35:59,760
A clown?

2316
01:35:59,980 --> 01:36:00,660
Oh my god.

2317
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:01,080
You're right.

2318
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:01,940
Wait you're right.

2319
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:02,200
Okay.

2320
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:03,400
I know there was a balloon here.

2321
01:36:03,940 --> 01:36:05,220
There was a balloon somewhere.

2322
01:36:05,580 --> 01:36:06,040
Oh my god.

2323
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:06,580
You're right guys.

2324
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:07,020
A clown.

2325
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:08,720
I'm gonna steal that idea and then pick it mine.

2326
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:09,440
Just like fashion.

2327
01:36:10,780 --> 01:36:12,140
Just like fast fashion.

2328
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:17,920
Exactly like fast fashion.

2329
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:19,780
Okay I need a...

2330
01:36:19,780 --> 01:36:21,360
Alright let's see.

2331
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:23,100
Um...

2332
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:23,860
It won't be that.

2333
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,300
We're gonna pick a random makeup.

2334
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:27,640
Wait actually is there clown makeup?

2335
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:30,560
Holy shit.

2336
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:32,460
What the fuck is that?

2337
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:33,880
Oh there is!

2338
01:36:35,180 --> 01:36:36,380
Nice there's clown makeup.

2339
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:36,860
That's good.

2340
01:36:36,940 --> 01:36:37,240
That's good.

2341
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:38,400
We won't be a clown.

2342
01:36:39,780 --> 01:36:40,440
That's good.

2343
01:36:41,180 --> 01:36:42,620
Okay we need a...

2344
01:36:43,420 --> 01:36:44,880
Okay we need white makeup.

2345

And then... Oh there's the balloon.

2346
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:47,600
There's the balloon.

2347
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:50,800
Okay red and then...

2348
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:52,260
Uh...

2349
01:36:52,260 --> 01:36:53,100
White.

2350
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:53,660
There we go.

2351
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:55,000
Oh my god.

2352
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:57,040
Somebody wants to be a mermaid?

2353
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:58,360
Mermaids aren't real.

2354
01:37:02,420 --> 01:37:03,500
You're a fucking...

2355
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:04,360
stupid child.

2356
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:10,740
Mermaids aren't real child.

2357
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:14,740
Alright let's see.

2358
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:15,740
White there we go.

2359
01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:16,720
Alright.

2360
01:37:17,140 --> 01:37:19,620
Not a clown.

2361
01:37:21,860 --> 01:37:23,360
Somebody is in fucking denial.

2362
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:25,660
Childhood dream.

2363
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:28,400
Alright let's see.

2364
01:37:29,140 --> 01:37:32,060

2365
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:32,840
Oh wait no not this.

2366
01:37:32,940 --> 01:37:35,160
I need to go to get my hair done.

2367
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:36,600
I need to get my hair done.

2368
01:37:38,260 --> 01:37:39,560
Breaker of dreams.

2369
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:40,980
Breaker of dreams.

2370
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:42,240
Uh...

2371
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:43,540
Let's see.

2372
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:45,120
I need like short hair.

2373
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:47,240
Oh I could do like...

2374
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:51,080
Uh do I want pom poms or...

2375
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:52,340
No I'll do this hair.

2376
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:54,440
And then I'm basically Harley Quinn.

2377
01:37:54,620 --> 01:37:56,740
I'm basically Harley Quinn.

2378
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:57,880
Okay.

2379
01:37:58,640 --> 01:37:59,900
Oh I don't know.

2380
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:01,320
I don't know about the bangs situation.

2381
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:04,060
Oh okay you know what?

2382
01:38:04,660 --> 01:38:05,500
You know what?

2383
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:06,660
I like it.

2384
01:38:06,740 --> 01:38:07,220
I think I like it.

2385
01:38:07,240 --> 01:38:07,680
I think I can make it work.

2386
01:38:07,780 --> 01:38:08,400
I can make this work.

2387
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:09,180
I can make this work.

2388
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:11,600
And then red.

2389
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:13,560
White.

2390
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:16,720
And then red.

2391
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:20,080
Oh yes I can definitely make this work.

2392
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:21,440
Um...

2393
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,020
I feel like...

2394
01:38:23,020 --> 01:38:24,540
Wait maybe if I do white.

2395
01:38:24,700 --> 01:38:26,800
And then red.

2396
01:38:28,340 --> 01:38:29,600
No I'm gonna do...

2397
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:30,800
I'm gonna do this.

2398
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:31,860
I think this is better.

2399
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:34,340
Yeah yeah yeah this is definitely better.

2400
01:38:34,780 --> 01:38:36,120
Harley Quinn is in...

2401
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:38,600
Harley Quinn is real to me.

2402
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:42,120
Harley Quinn is literally a therapist.

2403
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:43,100
Therapist.

2404
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:45,420
That means you're saying therapists aren't real.

2405
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:46,060
That's...

2406
01:38:48,380 --> 01:38:50,200
She's literally a therapist.

2407
01:38:55,180 --> 01:38:56,100
Let's see.

2408
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,020
Oh the tutu.

2409
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:00,900
Where's the tutu?

2410
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:01,740
Where is it?

2411
01:39:02,540 --> 01:39:05,220
Guys is tutu in the poor section or the rich section?

2412
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:09,320
Oh there.

2413
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:12,260
It's in the poor section.

2414
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:14,220
Alright and then...

2415
01:39:14,220 --> 01:39:16,020
Can I do like double patterns?

2416
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:19,300
Can I do like double patterns?

2417
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:19,920
Oh yes.

2418
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,640
Oh give me that gene mod texture.

2419
01:39:24,240 --> 01:39:24,960
Oh give me that gene mod texture.

2420
01:39:26,940 --> 01:39:28,020
Oh yes.

2421
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:29,240
Oh yes.

2422
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:36,460
Alright let's see.

2423
01:39:36,820 --> 01:39:36,860
Alright let's see.

2424
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:40,240
Alright.

2425
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:44,480
Uhh...

2426
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,440
Need like...

2427
01:39:51,380 --> 01:39:52,880
No I don't like that actually.

2428
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:53,980
No no no no no.

2429
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:55,840
Maybe this would be better.

2430
01:39:56,160 --> 01:39:57,360
I mean like grab.

2431
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:01,180
Ah I don't know what to put on my shirt.

2432
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:03,280
Guys I need to figure out...

2433
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:03,940
The corset!

2434
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:04,440
The corset!

2435
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:05,140
There's a corset!

2436
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:07,120
Oh my god.

2437
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:08,680
Where's the corset?

2438
01:40:08,900 --> 01:40:09,640
Where is it?

2439
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:12,420
Guys, where the fuck is the corset?

2440
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:14,760
Is this?

2441
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:16,500
Yes!

2442
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:18,440
Yes, girl!

2443
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:21,380
Yes.

2444
01:40:22,220 --> 01:40:24,260
Oh my god, yes girl.

2445
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:26,000
You know how to bring it.

2446
01:40:32,350 --> 01:40:36,520
Oh my god, you truly are... you're her.

2447
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:37,800
You're actually her.

2448
01:40:39,640 --> 01:40:40,940
You're actually her.

2449
01:40:41,860 --> 01:40:43,120
Holy shit.

2450
01:40:43,340 --> 01:40:47,120
These children don't know what fashion really is until I came along.

2451
01:40:49,900 --> 01:40:51,760
Oh my god.

2452
01:40:57,840 --> 01:40:59,820
You wanna be a princess?

2453
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:03,100
You mean you didn't grow up...

2454
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:06,780
You wanna be a goddamn princess?

2455
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:08,760
Oh my god.

2456
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:11,660
What small dreams you have.

2457
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:16,700
Okay.

2458
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:18,380
What's this?

2459
01:41:18,580 --> 01:41:20,200
Two princesses?

2460
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:23,120
Clearly you guys have zero creativity.

2461
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:30,360
Um, if you all... I mean... I mean princess is a choice if you're two.

2462
01:41:30,820 --> 01:41:33,720
This is the big leagues right now.

2463
01:41:35,180 --> 01:41:36,560
Seize the clown.

2464
01:41:38,540 --> 01:41:40,180
What the fuck is that?

2465
01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:40,920
A mermaid?

2466
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:41,640
Rabbit?

2467
01:41:41,880 --> 01:41:49,180
I wanted to be a mermaid but this is what I wanted me as a role mermaid to look like.

2468
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:50,900
Holy shit.

2469
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:54,440
Even as a doll, you don't know what colors mean.

2470
01:41:58,100 --> 01:41:59,940
Was that another mermaid?

2471
01:41:59,940 --> 01:42:00,320
Mermaid?

2472
01:42:04,050 --> 01:42:05,450
I got...

2473
01:42:07,490 --> 01:42:08,190
Trendsetter?

2474
01:42:10,610 --> 01:42:11,890
Trendsetter of the poor.

2475
01:42:12,170 --> 01:42:14,730
I wanna be Ursula but pretty?

2476
01:42:15,650 --> 01:42:17,050
Holy shit.

2477
01:42:17,950 --> 01:42:19,450
That's so fucked.

2478
01:42:19,570 --> 01:42:20,490
What is that?

2479
01:42:20,790 --> 01:42:23,950
I wanted to work with frogs and other things.

2480
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:24,350
Okay.

2481
01:42:24,450 --> 01:42:25,050
You know what?

2482
01:42:25,810 --> 01:42:27,270
That's really good.

2483
01:42:27,550 --> 01:42:29,510
That's actually really good.

2484
01:42:30,510 --> 01:42:34,570
She wanted... Basically she wanted to be a fucking frog.

2485
01:42:38,730 --> 01:42:39,610
Does it mean?

2486
01:42:39,670 --> 01:42:41,490
I wanted to be a clown.

2487
01:42:48,380 --> 01:42:49,080
That's right.

2488
01:42:50,780 --> 01:42:51,740
That's right.

2489
01:42:53,900 --> 01:42:55,440
Yeah, look at that.

2490
01:42:57,180 --> 01:42:57,820
Clowns.

2491
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:01,220
Don't go outside.

2492
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:04,180
No, I shouldn't say that to the child.

2493
01:43:09,740 --> 01:43:10,420
Whoa.

2494
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:17,980
Look, I didn't... I didn't say it.

2495
01:43:18,080 --> 01:43:18,860
I didn't type.

2496
01:43:18,940 --> 01:43:20,620
I didn't press enter.

2497
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:24,500
I didn't... I didn't press enter chat.

2498
01:43:26,020 --> 01:43:27,060
Let's see.

2499
01:43:32,180 --> 01:43:36,300
She wants to be... She wants to be the cheerleader for the Dallas Cowboys.

2500
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:41,540
Cow, I'm glad you could achieve your dream.

2501
01:43:41,700 --> 01:43:42,760
What the fuck?

2502
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:43,880
There's two cheer...

2503
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:45,200
Guys, girls, aim higher.

2504
01:43:47,340 --> 01:43:49,160
You almost said that.

2505
01:43:49,220 --> 01:43:49,960
That's crazy.

2506
01:43:51,820 --> 01:43:52,780
I said...

2507
01:43:52,780 --> 01:43:53,880
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

2508
01:43:54,340 --> 01:43:55,600
Get it, get it, boom.

2509
01:43:55,780 --> 01:43:56,860
Get it, get it, boom.

2510
01:43:56,860 --> 01:43:57,600
Boom, ba-da-da.

2511
01:44:01,460 --> 01:44:02,140
What?

2512
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:08,040
The cheerleader won?

2513
01:44:09,640 --> 01:44:11,260
Are you fucking...

2514
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:13,520
I'm eighth?

2515
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:19,780
Princesses.

2516
01:44:20,300 --> 01:44:23,980
Two girls wanted to be princesses?

2517
01:44:23,980 --> 01:44:25,800
And then we had two mermaids.

2518
01:44:26,060 --> 01:44:27,600
This is... This is rigged.

2519
01:44:27,640 --> 01:44:29,220
This is actually rigged.

2520
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:29,800
Like...

2521
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:31,240
This is actually...

2522
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:32,380
Fucked.

2523
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:33,200
Like...

2524
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:35,420
You don't deserve to be up here.

2525
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:38,940
I forgot what kids like.

2526
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:42,440
I'm a fun... Kids like clowns.

2527
01:44:42,440 --> 01:44:44,740
Why the fuck would people hire clowns?

2528
01:44:44,740 --> 01:44:45,820
At parties?

2529
01:44:45,820 --> 01:44:47,980
If kids didn't like them?

2530
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:55,700
Oh my god.

2531
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:57,620
This is not fair.

2532
01:44:59,380 --> 01:45:02,580
What child wants to be a clown?

2533
01:45:02,900 --> 01:45:04,340
Wait, everybody left.

2534
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:08,040
Everybody...

2535
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:08,540
What?

2536
01:45:09,180 --> 01:45:10,440
Everybody left.

2537
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:12,280
Wait...

2538
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:13,420
Everybody...

2539
01:45:13,420 --> 01:45:14,440
Wait...

2540
01:45:14,440 --> 01:45:15,400
They all left.

2541
01:45:17,100 --> 01:45:17,860
They...

2542
01:45:17,860 --> 01:45:19,500
They actually formed a clique.

2543
01:45:19,660 --> 01:45:20,940
Like, that's so fucked.

2544
01:45:21,140 --> 01:45:23,900
We played one game and a clique was formed.

2545
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:24,420
Like...

2546
01:45:24,420 --> 01:45:25,240
I don't know.

2547
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:26,940
I don't know.

2548
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:27,600
I don't know.

2549
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:28,180
We played...

2550
01:45:28,180 --> 01:45:29,120
Oh shit.

2551
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:30,140
Spice Girls.

2552
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:31,120
I don't fucking know.

2553
01:45:31,240 --> 01:45:32,000
I don't remember what they looked.

2554
01:45:32,220 --> 01:45:32,540
Bro.

2555
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:33,520
Spice Girls?

2556
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:34,720
With children?

2557
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:35,560
Like...

2558
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:37,360
Children don't know...

2559
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:37,940
What...

2560
01:45:40,180 --> 01:45:43,340
Children don't know what Spice Girls are.

2561
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:46,700
Literally someone's gonna dress as a literal spice.

2562
01:45:47,220 --> 01:45:50,180
Cause that's what they think Spice Girls are.

2563
01:45:50,580 --> 01:45:51,100
They...

2564
01:45:53,740 --> 01:45:56,080
Someone's gonna dress as a hot chili pepper.

2565
01:45:56,380 --> 01:45:57,580
Cause they don't know what...

2566
01:45:57,580 --> 01:45:59,420
What the fuck a Spice Girl is?

2567
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:00,860
Like...

2568
01:46:00,860 --> 01:46:05,260
Hahahaha Hahahaha Look!

2569
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:08,800
Like she's really a fucking chili pepper!

2570
01:46:09,650 --> 01:46:12,460
The children don't know what it is!

2571
01:46:12,740 --> 01:46:13,600
Like...

2572
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:15,080
That's actually...

2573
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:15,740
Sorry...

2574
01:46:15,740 --> 01:46:17,200
Who's thought of this theme?

2575
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:19,820
Um...

2576
01:46:19,820 --> 01:46:23,060
Might be better to be honest.

2577
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:27,300
Hahahaha Okay...

2578
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:30,100
Alright, last game guys!

2579
01:46:30,220 --> 01:46:30,740
Last game!

2580
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:31,840
I did not...

2581
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:35,460
I did not think I'd get this absorbed into Dressed to Impress guys.

2582
01:46:35,740 --> 01:46:38,020
Dressed to Impress has been fucking wild.

2583
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:40,560
Alright...

2584
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:42,880
What the fuck?

2585
01:46:43,020 --> 01:46:43,860
What the fuck?

2586
01:46:45,620 --> 01:46:49,860
Hahahaha Hahahaha I can't...

2587
01:46:49,860 --> 01:46:51,020
I can't...

2588
01:46:53,120 --> 01:46:54,440
Holy shit!

2589
01:46:54,540 --> 01:46:55,120

2606
01:47:29,660 --> 01:47:30,020

01:47:30,020 --> 01:47:33,040

01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:52,180
That seems right!

2618
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:54,500

2619
01:47:54,500 --> 01:48:01,560

2629
01:48:28,460 --> 01:48:29,260
Oh wait!

2630
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:29,640

01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:32,820
Shit!

2634
01:48:32,940 --> 01:48:33,560
You're right!

2635
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:35,020
I'm indie!

2636
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:35,840

2637
01:48:35,860 --> 01:48:36,220
Okay!

2638
01:48:36,440 --> 01:48:37,340
You know what?

2639
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:38,640
This is awkward.

2640
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:40,720
We're all dead inside anyway.

2641
01:48:40,940 --> 01:48:41,820
You're right!

2642
01:48:42,040 --> 01:48:42,640
Hahaha!

2643
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:43,320

01:48:48,140 --> 01:48:49,940
I gotta figure something out!

2649
01:48:49,980 --> 01:48:51,060
I don't fucking know!

2650
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:52,180
Hahaha!

2651
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:54,480
Ha ha ha!

2652
01:48:56,160 --> 01:48:57,520

01:48:57,940 --> 01:48:59,780
Bro, I'm just gonna give nothing!

2654
01:49:00,620 --> 01:49:04,060
This is what we're all like inside.

2655
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:10,400
This is what we all look like inside.

2656
01:49:11,140 --> 01:49:11,580
Hahaha!

2657
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:13,760
I'm the manager!

2658
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:14,860
You're right!

2659
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,200
I'll just be like that.

2660
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:17,560
I'll be like, I'm the manager!

2661
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:19,240
Hahaha...

2662
01:49:19,240 --> 01:49:20,260
Hahaha!

2663
01:49:20,260 --> 01:49:20,360
Hahaha!

2664
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:21,040
Hahaha!

2665
01:49:22,820 --> 01:49:23,860
Okay, let's see.

2666
01:49:24,460 --> 01:49:26,340
Let me at least change my shirt.

2667
01:49:26,740 --> 01:49:27,900
Now that I know.

2668
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:30,400
Guys!

2669
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:31,720
I see what you tried!

2670
01:49:32,360 --> 01:49:33,560
I'm an indie!

2671
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:35,860
You already failed the challenge!

2672
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:41,180
Okay, there we go.

2673
01:49:41,540 --> 01:49:43,700
Should have liked the blue earlier though.

2674
01:49:43,940 --> 01:49:45,000
Oh, not that blue.

2675
01:49:45,180 --> 01:49:45,880
Okay, well.

2676
01:49:49,380 --> 01:49:51,780
Not that blue.

2677
01:49:54,420 --> 01:49:56,260
Holy shit!

2678
01:49:56,480 --> 01:50:00,000
I can't believe I actually got this theme.

2679
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:02,460
That's actually fucking crazy.

2680
01:50:02,940 --> 01:50:04,560
That's the last match.

2681
01:50:04,700 --> 01:50:06,260
That's actually insane.

2682
01:50:11,620 --> 01:50:13,540
Holy fuck.

2683
01:50:14,780 --> 01:50:15,860
Is that supposed to be the end?

2684
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:16,260
Is that supposed to be me?

2685
01:50:16,760 --> 01:50:17,060
I...

2686
01:50:17,060 --> 01:50:19,000
Five stars if it is.

2687
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:24,960
Five stars if it is.

2688
01:50:25,620 --> 01:50:26,520
Oh my god!

2689
01:50:26,540 --> 01:50:27,880
It's TokiBird!

2690
01:50:27,980 --> 01:50:29,960
The indie Vtuber!

2691
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:31,700
What's this?

2692
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:35,640
Batty, girl.

2693
01:50:36,660 --> 01:50:37,860
Who the fuck is that?

2694
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:45,600
Batty, girl.

2695
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:49,560
Is that me?

2696
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:51,360
Who the fuck is this?

2697
01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:54,740
NicoleTV?

2698
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:57,880
Who the fuck is NicoleTV?

2699
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:02,720
PrestonPlays?

2700
01:51:02,900 --> 01:51:04,960
These are not Vtubers!

2701
01:51:06,340 --> 01:51:11,060
Is it just... Is it just the...

2702
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:15,900
I'm the... I'm the manager.

2703
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:23,300

2704
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:23,460
Yeah!

2705
01:51:32,550 --> 01:51:32,880
Oh!

2706
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:34,400
Isn't that the...

2707
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:36,540
the... from the fucking...

2708
01:51:36,540 --> 01:51:38,300
that new anime show?

2709
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:40,740
About the girl being Vtuber?

2710
01:51:41,060 --> 01:51:41,620
Thing?

2711
01:51:41,980 --> 01:51:42,680
Isn't that...

2712
01:51:42,680 --> 01:51:43,320
Isn't that it?

2713
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:44,600
That new anime show?

2714
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:49,420
From the... from...

2715
01:51:49,420 --> 01:51:51,760
What was it about that Vtuber anime show?

2716
01:51:53,300 --> 01:51:54,180
What was it that?

2717
01:51:54,440 --> 01:51:57,540
Yeah, there's a new anime show about like Vtubers.

2718
01:52:01,180 --> 01:52:02,160
Vtuber legend?

2719
01:52:02,360 --> 01:52:07,280
About how this Vtuber was fucking like going there and then was like...

2720
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:14,720
And then like she had a hot mic situation where she was super vulgar and wasn't actually like the cute Vtuber.

2721
01:52:16,140 --> 01:52:17,260
Legendary Vtuber!

2722
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:17,760
Yeah!

2723
01:52:18,420 --> 01:52:19,380
Legendary Vtuber!

2724
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:22,040
Yeah, that's it!

2725
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:24,820
I heard it's really funny.

2726
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:27,040
I heard that show was really, really funny.

2727
01:52:29,060 --> 01:52:30,660
Is that Jerma?

2728
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:34,820
Is that...

2729
01:52:34,820 --> 01:52:37,200
Is that Jerma?

2730
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:40,480
What the fuck?

2731
01:52:40,940 --> 01:52:42,280
Is that...

2732
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:47,240
What the fuck is like some of these bits?

2733
01:52:47,460 --> 01:52:48,140
Like...

2734
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:53,400
Wait!

2735
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:54,540
There's two of them?

2736
01:52:54,660 --> 01:52:55,620
That's not fair!

2737
01:52:55,620 --> 01:52:56,920
I'm fucking leaving.

2738
01:52:57,260 --> 01:52:59,060
How dare they...

2739
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:00,360
This is rigged!

2740
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:01,020
How is there two?

2741
01:53:02,140 --> 01:53:03,380
Fuck this guys.

2742
01:53:03,540 --> 01:53:04,540
I'm rebooting.

2743
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:06,200
This should not be last game.

2744
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:08,560
I can't believe there's two.

2745
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:09,800
That's cheating!

2746
01:53:10,780 --> 01:53:12,580
Why is there two of them?

2747
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:14,560
That's actually cheating!

2748
01:53:15,340 --> 01:53:15,980
That's actually cheating!

2749
01:53:15,980 --> 01:53:16,140
Like...

2750
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:21,620
That's zero stars.

2751
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:23,380
That's zero stars.

2752
01:53:23,380 --> 01:53:25,600
I can't believe... It's already rigged before I even started.

2753
01:53:25,620 --> 01:53:26,120
I got in!

2754
01:53:26,420 --> 01:53:27,360
Alright, Preppy.

2755
01:53:27,580 --> 01:53:29,200
That's actually cheating.

2756
01:53:29,380 --> 01:53:30,580
Holy fuck.

2757
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:32,880
I can't believe it.

2758
01:53:37,260 --> 01:53:39,120
Why can they do two?

2759
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:40,800
That's fucked.

2760
01:53:40,940 --> 01:53:42,480
That's so fucked.

2761
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:43,400

01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:44,940
Okay, this is LG.

2763
01:53:46,420 --> 01:53:50,040
This is LG for real.

2764
01:53:55,660 --> 01:53:56,680
Let's go gambling!

2765
01:53:57,740 --> 01:53:58,820
Let's go gambling!

2766
01:53:59,820 --> 01:54:00,700
Oh my god.

2767
01:54:00,720 --> 01:54:01,320
I can't believe it.

2768
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:03,680
How do I... Wait, how do I duo up with somebody?

2769
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,160
How do I do that?

2770
01:54:08,240 --> 01:54:09,280
How do I duo?

2771
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,480
I wanna duo with some...

2772
01:54:14,060 --> 01:54:15,320
Oh, dang it.

2773
01:54:17,140 --> 01:54:17,920
Top icon?

2774
01:54:18,580 --> 01:54:19,360
Where is it?

2775
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:21,560
Where is it?

2776
01:54:21,580 --> 01:54:21,900
This one?

2777
01:54:22,700 --> 01:54:23,620
Oh shit!

2778
01:54:23,720 --> 01:54:24,100
Okay.

2779
01:54:24,920 --> 01:54:25,600
What the...

2780
01:54:25,620 --> 01:54:26,000
Oh fuck.

2781
01:54:26,540 --> 01:54:27,100
Alright.

2782
01:54:27,900 --> 01:54:29,020
Let's... I don't know.

2783
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:30,920
Who has... Alright.

2784
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:31,780
Monkey girl.

2785
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:32,460
Let's duo.

2786
01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:35,440
Let's duo.

2787
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:36,860
Okay, wait.

2788
01:54:37,260 --> 01:54:38,360
Alright, let's see.

2789
01:54:38,740 --> 01:54:39,520
Casino Night.

2790
01:54:42,340 --> 01:54:42,900
Uh...

2791
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:44,620
What is...

2792
01:54:45,460 --> 01:54:45,740
Okay.

2793
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:49,240
I don't know who I invited.

2794
01:54:49,560 --> 01:54:50,320
Casino Night.

2795
01:54:50,360 --> 01:54:51,100
We're bringing it back.

2796
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:54,060
We're gonna reuse the same look as before.

2797
01:54:56,040 --> 01:54:59,100
It's the same look as before.

2798
01:55:02,340 --> 01:55:03,760
What do you mean?

2799
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:05,620
I'm literally gambling!

2800
01:55:06,220 --> 01:55:08,620
How the fuck is that Casino Night?

2801
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:09,280
You're literally...

2802
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:10,440
Oh, wait.

2803
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:11,260
They're duoing?

2804
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:12,800
Wait, that's not fair!

2805
01:55:13,860 --> 01:55:15,340
That's not fair!

2806
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:18,000
Why do they have friends?

2807
01:55:20,380 --> 01:55:22,320
How dare they?

2808
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:25,520
How fucking...

2809
01:55:25,620 --> 01:55:27,120
dare they have friends?

2810
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:28,900
I'm so insulted.

2811
01:55:29,220 --> 01:55:29,700
Like...

2812
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:33,280
We're gonna re...

2813
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:33,900
You know what?

2814
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:36,120
What would it look like if we like...

2815
01:55:36,120 --> 01:55:37,460
Oh, we can't do that?

2816
01:55:37,960 --> 01:55:39,020
What's the point?

2817
01:55:40,620 --> 01:55:41,260
Alright.

2818
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:42,400
That's not fair.

2819
01:55:42,620 --> 01:55:43,940
I can't believe they have friends.

2820
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:46,300
I can't fucking believe it.

2821
01:55:49,460 --> 01:55:50,100
Alright.

2822
01:55:50,700 --> 01:55:51,340
Red.

2823
01:55:51,800 --> 01:55:52,440
Woah!

2824
01:55:52,660 --> 01:55:53,040
What?

2825
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:53,640
What?

2826
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:55,360
How do you have six wings?

2827
01:55:56,140 --> 01:55:58,800
It's Casino Night, not Satanic Night!

2828
01:55:59,100 --> 01:55:59,540
Like...

2829
01:56:00,280 --> 01:56:02,800
Bro, why is everybody a Satan?

2830
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:04,120
Like...

2831
01:56:04,120 --> 01:56:05,360
Wait, what?

2832
01:56:07,380 --> 01:56:08,540
Why is...

2833
01:56:08,920 --> 01:56:10,340
Okay, but like, why?

2834
01:56:10,660 --> 01:56:15,780
Why is every... Like, literally, why is everybody fucking angels and devils?

2835
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:17,820
Is this what they think gambling is?

2836
01:56:18,080 --> 01:56:20,380
Is this what you children think gambling is?

2837
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:21,000
Like...

2838
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:23,880
I think...

2839
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:27,880
There's no way it's what children think gambling is.

2840
01:56:28,100 --> 01:56:29,920
It's like the fucking...

2841
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:31,540
It's like the...

2842
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:37,160
The game of...

2843
01:56:37,160 --> 01:56:39,180
The game of evil.

2844
01:56:39,420 --> 01:56:40,240
The game of evil.

2845
01:56:40,720 --> 01:56:43,880
Gambling is the work of the devil.

2846
01:56:46,180 --> 01:56:47,560
Gambling is...

2847
01:56:47,560 --> 01:56:49,560
Gambling is a sin, Doki.

2848
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:54,120
How dare you What the fuck?

2849
01:56:54,200 --> 01:56:54,380
What the fuck?

2850
01:56:54,380 --> 01:56:58,080
Gambling is either the best thing in the world, or a fucking sin.

2851
01:56:59,160 --> 01:57:01,080
Dressed like a casino dealer.

2852
01:57:01,460 --> 01:57:02,360
I can't!

2853
01:57:02,360 --> 01:57:03,580
There's no outfit!

2854
01:57:03,680 --> 01:57:05,100
I don't have enough time!

2855
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:07,460
Oh, wait.

2856
01:57:07,580 --> 01:57:08,060
A tie.

2857
01:57:08,260 --> 01:57:10,620
I'll be like, I'm the casino... I'm the...

2858
01:57:11,940 --> 01:57:14,980
I'm the casino dealer that didn't follow the dress code.

2859
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,020
I didn't follow the dress code.

2860
01:57:23,420 --> 01:57:25,060
God, the fuck.

2861
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:26,600
Alright, we're good.

2862
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:29,020
This is how we're gonna end it.

2863
01:57:32,140 --> 01:57:32,900
How

2864
01:57:36,470 --> 01:57:37,170
the fuck?

2865
01:57:37,310 --> 01:57:37,730
Okay.

2866
01:57:39,510 --> 01:57:43,290
How is this... How is this casino night?

2867
01:57:44,330 --> 01:57:45,530
I look...

2868
01:57:45,530 --> 01:57:47,830
Jesus Christ!

2869
01:57:48,470 --> 01:57:49,830
I look...

2870
01:57:50,570 --> 01:57:52,650
Jesus fucking Christ!

2871
01:57:52,790 --> 01:57:53,490
Okay.

2872
01:57:54,650 --> 01:57:56,610
Your outfit is...

2873
01:57:57,890 --> 01:57:58,650
Now...

2874
01:58:00,650 --> 01:58:01,410
Like...

2875
01:58:01,410 --> 01:58:05,570
How is this cas... How is this casino night?

2876
01:58:11,150 --> 01:58:12,630
I'm calling you out.

2877
01:58:12,770 --> 01:58:14,650
I'm calling you fucking out.

2878
01:58:14,870 --> 01:58:16,030
It's a nice fit.

2879
01:58:16,190 --> 01:58:19,290
How is any of this casino night?

2880
01:58:19,530 --> 01:58:21,730
No, we changed the theme!

2881
01:58:22,150 --> 01:58:23,570
You can't!

2882
01:58:23,570 --> 01:58:24,210
What?

2883
01:58:26,350 --> 01:58:29,370
I'm just kidding!

2884
01:58:30,010 --> 01:58:31,970
I'm just kidding!

2885
01:58:31,970 --> 01:58:36,970
I'm just kidding!

2886
01:58:36,970 --> 01:58:37,750
So fucked!

2887
01:58:38,430 --> 01:58:43,310
We don't like the next theme, then you can't!

2888
01:58:43,310 --> 01:58:44,070
Bro!

2889
01:58:44,350 --> 01:58:45,510
I...

2890
01:58:46,150 --> 01:58:47,850
I just can't!

2891
01:58:49,930 --> 01:58:50,570
Bro...

2892
01:58:51,090 --> 01:58:51,630
Bro...

2893
01:58:51,630 --> 01:58:52,350
Bro...

2894
01:58:56,320 --> 01:59:01,440
I... I wasn't there for the theme change!

2895
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:05,840
Oh my god!

2896
01:59:05,860 --> 01:59:09,900
This is so fucking rigged!

2897
01:59:09,960 --> 01:59:12,000
This is a fucking click!

2898
01:59:12,460 --> 01:59:13,380
Like...

2899
01:59:13,380 --> 01:59:18,940
This is actually so fucked!

2900
01:59:19,400 --> 01:59:20,680
Holy shit!

2901
01:59:20,700 --> 01:59:23,320
I thought it was a fucking game for children!

2902
01:59:23,720 --> 01:59:25,780
How is there groups already?

2903
01:59:26,680 --> 01:59:29,500
The race spoiled you again!

2904
01:59:29,880 --> 01:59:32,160
Cas, thank you for the super chat!

2905
01:59:32,340 --> 01:59:33,740
Thank you, thank you!

2906
01:59:34,040 --> 01:59:36,900
Why are children so...

2907
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:44,540
I'll just be like, gambling is a sin, so technically I'm a double!

2908
01:59:48,240 --> 01:59:49,580
I'll say that!

2909
01:59:49,700 --> 01:59:51,740
I'll say that at the moment!

2910
01:59:52,280 --> 01:59:53,800
I miss...

2911
01:59:54,160 --> 01:59:57,000
Bro, I wasn't invited to the fucking theme change!

2912
01:59:58,980 --> 02:00:02,140
Children literally forming cliques is crazy!

2913
02:00:02,700 --> 02:00:04,600
Johnny, thank you for the super chat!

2914
02:00:04,700 --> 02:00:05,760
Thank you, thank you!

2915
02:00:06,120 --> 02:00:06,460
Hahaha!

2916
02:00:08,480 --> 02:00:11,720
I got played by god damn children!

2917
02:00:12,300 --> 02:00:13,900
Oh my god!

2918
02:00:16,020 --> 02:00:17,360
Oh my god!

2919
02:00:17,420 --> 02:00:18,440
This is not...

2920
02:00:18,440 --> 02:00:19,120
Hahaha!

2921
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:21,720
Hahaha!

2922
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:23,060
I didn't say that!

2923
02:00:24,160 --> 02:00:24,300
Hahaha!

2924
02:00:27,700 --> 02:00:29,700
Holy shit!

2925
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:30,320
Holy shit!

2926
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:31,940
I lost lay!

2927
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:34,460
That's fucking right!

2928
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:36,040
Okay, hun!

2929
02:00:36,300 --> 02:00:36,840
Bro!

2930
02:00:37,180 --> 02:00:39,500
What the fuck did you hunt me?

2931
02:00:39,860 --> 02:00:40,860
Bro!

2932
02:00:41,020 --> 02:00:41,660
I...

2933
02:00:41,660 --> 02:00:45,200
I hate children so much!

2934
02:00:45,300 --> 02:00:46,540
I hate kids!

2935
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:47,680
I...

2936
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:49,540
I hate children!

2937
02:00:51,800 --> 02:00:52,940
Fuck children!

2938
02:00:54,160 --> 02:00:54,200
Hahaha!

2939
02:00:55,900 --> 02:00:58,340
Oh my god!

2940
02:00:58,640 --> 02:01:01,960
She didn't know we changed the theme!

2941
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:03,880
I...

2942
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:07,000
I got there when...

2943
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:12,080
when everyone was already tripping off!

2944
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:13,700
Bro, I...

2945
02:01:13,700 --> 02:01:15,320
I hate children.

2946
02:01:15,600 --> 02:01:19,060
I hate children so much!

2947
02:01:19,460 --> 02:01:21,040
Holy shit!

2948
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:22,260
I hate...

2949
02:01:22,260 --> 02:01:26,460
Imagine getting a cape by a six year old!

2950
02:01:26,700 --> 02:01:28,840
God damn children!

2951
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:31,860
How do I make my own server?

2952
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:33,280
I need to boost my ego.

2953
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:36,180
How the fuck do I make my own server?

2954
02:01:36,760 --> 02:01:37,120
Hahaha!

2955
02:01:38,060 --> 02:01:39,780
Children are evil!

2956
02:01:40,260 --> 02:01:42,000
Children deserve nothing!

2957
02:01:42,420 --> 02:01:44,700
I need to make my own server!

2958
02:01:45,200 --> 02:01:45,920
Hahaha!

2959
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:48,400
Where is it?

2960
02:01:48,400 --> 02:01:49,780
How do I do it?

2961
02:01:51,140 --> 02:01:53,120
I have a hundred robux!

2962
02:01:53,340 --> 02:01:57,140
Oh that was one of the LGs of all time!

2963
02:01:57,980 --> 02:01:58,580
Hahaha!

2964
02:02:00,840 --> 02:02:02,320
Oh my god!

02:04:28,650 --> 02:04:34,230
If those kids can make their theme, we're gonna make our own- we're gonna do FNAF.

3034
02:04:34,550 --> 02:04:37,050
I say we do FNAF!

Bring in the Dokiverse!

3048
02:05:09,350 --> 02:05:09,990

02:05:17,710 --> 02:05:19,030
I don't have it!

3053
02:05:20,250 --> 02:05:21,370
I want the Dokiverse, guys!

3054
02:05:21,590 --> 02:05:23,310
Ignore- ignore this!

3055
02:05:23,990 --> 02:05:26,450
We make our own theme.

3056
02:05:27,010 --> 02:05:27,650
Hahaha!

3057
02:05:28,950 --> 02:05:31,370
I want Dokiverse.

Hahaha!

3061
02:05:38,910 --> 02:05:42,390
If they can make their theme, this is my clique.

3062
02:05:42,590 --> 02:05:44,010
This is my Dragoon clique.

3063
02:05:44,130 --> 02:05:44,710
That's right.

3064
02:05:44,870 --> 02:05:46,790
I want the Dokiverse.

3065
02:05:46,910 --> 02:05:48,330
I know what I'm gonna be.

3066
02:05:48,530 --> 02:05:49,710
I know- hahaha!

3067
02:05:50,250 --> 02:05:50,430

02:06:00,550 --> 02:06:01,910
Alright, let's see.

3072
02:06:02,870 --> 02:06:04,410
Do not be afraid.

3073
02:06:04,910 --> 02:06:05,470
Hahaha!

3074
02:06:06,190 --> 02:06:06,190
Hahaha!

3075
02:06:07,110 --> 02:06:07,910
Let's see.

3076
02:06:08,810 --> 02:06:09,370
Um...

3077
02:06:10,490 --> 02:06:11,530
Fucking children.

3078
02:06:11,650 --> 02:06:12,490
I hate kids.

3079
02:06:12,730 --> 02:06:13,210
Hahaha!

3080
02:06:13,330 --> 02:06:16,530
I'm so okay- oh, we changed the theme.

3081
02:06:16,670 --> 02:06:17,950
Sorry, we didn't tell you.

3082
02:06:18,030 --> 02:06:22,850
Even though, like, we know that you just got here, like, we didn't tell you that we actually changed the theme.

3083
02:06:23,170 --> 02:06:23,650
Hahaha!

3084
02:06:25,550 --> 02:06:27,130
I hate children.

3085
02:06:27,430 --> 02:06:27,910
Hahaha!

3086
02:06:29,370 --> 02:06:30,050
Hahaha!

3087
02:06:30,170 --> 02:06:30,310
Hahaha!

3088
02:06:30,310 --> 02:06:31,750
I'm so tilted.

3089
02:06:31,990 --> 02:06:33,750
Yes, I am tilted!

3090
02:06:34,570 --> 02:06:37,450
I- my outfit was so good!

3091
02:06:38,730 --> 02:06:40,950
This all is real.

3092
02:06:41,290 --> 02:06:44,130
I had such a good outfit!

3093
02:06:44,610 --> 02:06:46,850
And then they were like, oh sorry.

3094
02:06:47,230 --> 02:06:47,910
Oh sorry.

3095
02:06:47,910 --> 02:06:50,750
And then they okayed Hunmi.

3096
02:06:51,010 --> 02:06:53,830
Like, that's the most insulting part.

3097
02:06:54,110 --> 02:06:56,170
A fucking 13 year old.

3098
02:06:56,290 --> 02:06:57,590
I bet you they weren't even 13.

3099
02:06:57,710 --> 02:07:00,610
A fucking 10 year old fucking okayed Hunmi.

3100
02:07:00,850 --> 02:07:01,550
Bitch.

3101
02:07:01,850 --> 02:07:02,430
Hahaha!

3102
02:07:03,720 --> 02:07:05,170
They're just kids.

3103
02:07:05,750 --> 02:07:06,450
Hahaha!

3104
02:07:08,610 --> 02:07:11,130
It's fucking real life now.

3105
02:07:12,730 --> 02:07:15,410
This is- This is a serious game.

3106
02:07:15,650 --> 02:07:16,110
Hahaha!

3107
02:07:18,250 --> 02:07:18,850
Hahaha!

3108
02:07:18,890 --> 02:07:21,150
This is a very serious game.

3109
02:07:21,470 --> 02:07:25,550
This is- this is the most serious game of my life.

3110
02:07:25,850 --> 02:07:26,430
Hahaha!

3111
02:07:28,410 --> 02:07:29,010
Hahaha!

3112
02:07:31,210 --> 02:07:32,470
We need something.

3113
02:07:32,630 --> 02:07:34,650
We need like, green hair at the top.

3114
02:07:34,870 --> 02:07:37,870
We need like- I don't need real gaming.

3115
02:07:38,170 --> 02:07:38,930
It's a lot.

3116
02:07:39,290 --> 02:07:42,310
Alright, we need like a s- a green hair somewhere.

3117
02:07:43,690 --> 02:07:43,990
Alright.

3118
02:07:44,690 --> 02:07:45,570
Let's see.

3119
02:07:46,690 --> 02:07:48,430
Okay, I don't - This is crazy!

3120
02:07:49,070 --> 02:07:51,810
That's what I was fucking saying!!!!!

3121
02:07:51,810 --> 02:07:58,590
I'm fine if the child did an okay huh, Hunmi.

3122
02:07:58,930 --> 02:08:00,890
Then I would have been fine.

3123
02:08:01,430 --> 02:08:04,190
I would have- I can't with my ego.

3124
02:08:04,490 --> 02:08:05,150
It's gone.

3125
02:08:05,870 --> 02:08:08,330
Did we learn not to tilt you?

3126
02:08:08,610 --> 02:08:13,710
I spent a hundred ropmex just to make myself feel better.

3127
02:08:13,970 --> 02:08:15,910
Hahaha!ج

3128
02:08:19,390 --> 02:08:20,370
I'm done.

3129
02:08:20,570 --> 02:08:21,530
Oh my god.

3130
02:08:21,610 --> 02:08:22,370
This is it.

3131
02:08:22,570 --> 02:08:24,590
I'm actually... oh my god.

3132
02:08:24,630 --> 02:08:25,970
My fit is perfect.

3133
02:08:26,290 --> 02:08:28,730
My fit is actually perfect.

3134
02:08:32,210 --> 02:08:38,710
You know kids, I actually spent a hundred Robux just to feel better about myself.

3135
02:08:39,070 --> 02:08:43,430
That was okay, really mind-broker beyond belief.

3136
02:08:43,770 --> 02:08:45,650
Ivy, thank you for the super chat.

3137
02:08:45,770 --> 02:08:47,010
Thank you, thank you.

3138
02:08:50,910 --> 02:08:52,310
Bro, I'm already done.

3139
02:08:52,570 --> 02:08:57,210
I fucking beat so many kids that I know exactly what my fit is gonna be.

3140
02:08:57,430 --> 02:08:59,430
I hate those kids.

3141
02:08:59,770 --> 02:09:01,910
Kids are fucking ruthless!

3142
02:09:02,330 --> 02:09:06,030
They don't have... they haven't learned what empathy is.

3143
02:09:06,510 --> 02:09:08,810
So they say whatever the fuck they want.

3144
02:09:09,230 --> 02:09:10,590
They're so mean.

3145
02:09:10,690 --> 02:09:12,090
I hate children.

3146
02:09:14,610 --> 02:09:15,930
There's a crow key.

3147
02:09:16,030 --> 02:09:16,330
Where?

3148
02:09:19,050 --> 02:09:21,210
Who the fuck is that guy?

3149
02:09:21,630 --> 02:09:23,530
That guy.

3150
02:09:23,790 --> 02:09:25,150
Wait, there's a crow key.

3151
02:09:25,190 --> 02:09:26,930
Oh my god, there is!

3152
02:09:27,590 --> 02:09:29,990
Okay guys, we shouldn't spoil ourselves.

3153
02:09:30,230 --> 02:09:31,510
Let's look outside the window.

3154
02:09:32,610 --> 02:09:35,110
Guys, we can't spoil ourselves, guys.

3155
02:09:35,870 --> 02:09:36,390
Again.

3156
02:09:36,390 --> 02:09:37,470
Oh my god.

3157
02:09:37,950 --> 02:09:39,390
Guys, thank you for the super chat.

3158
02:09:39,470 --> 02:09:40,190
Thank you, thank you.

3159
02:09:40,190 --> 02:09:47,130
Those Overwatch players, GoBarts, DPS players, move through this game because these kids know how to deal damage.

3160
02:09:47,130 --> 02:09:47,570
Damn it.

3161
02:09:47,910 --> 02:09:49,570
Thank you for the super chat.

3162
02:09:49,650 --> 02:09:50,230
Thank you.

3163
02:09:50,570 --> 02:09:52,590
Guys, we can't spoil ourselves, guys.

3164
02:09:53,130 --> 02:09:54,250
It's gotta be a surprise.

3165
02:09:54,450 --> 02:09:55,430
Alright, let's figure out some poses.

3166
02:09:56,590 --> 02:09:58,610
Let's figure out some poses that we can do.

3167
02:09:58,870 --> 02:09:59,830
Alright, let's see.

3168
02:10:01,230 --> 02:10:01,670
Ooh.

3169
02:10:01,770 --> 02:10:02,150
Ooh!

3170
02:10:02,770 --> 02:10:03,210
Yes!

3171
02:10:03,590 --> 02:10:04,390
Okay, what is this?

3172
02:10:04,570 --> 02:10:05,290
Is that 8?

3173
02:10:05,430 --> 02:10:06,690
Guys, remember 8 for me.

3174
02:10:07,030 --> 02:10:08,690
Guys, we gotta remember pose 8.

3175
02:10:09,330 --> 02:10:10,370
Oh, this is the one.

3176
02:10:10,630 --> 02:10:11,070
Sprint.

3177
02:10:11,970 --> 02:10:14,210
This is the one that she kept doing.

3178
02:10:18,590 --> 02:10:20,230
Okay, we gotta remember 8.

3179
02:10:20,330 --> 02:10:20,930
Pose 8.

3180
02:10:22,670 --> 02:10:23,270
Okay.

3181
02:10:23,270 --> 02:10:24,210
Let's see.

3182
02:10:24,670 --> 02:10:25,270
Ooh.

3183
02:10:25,650 --> 02:10:26,530
Yes, girl.

3184
02:10:26,910 --> 02:10:27,890
Alright, 20.

3185
02:10:29,870 --> 02:10:32,230
We're serving some tomato juice right now.

3186
02:10:32,610 --> 02:10:33,510
Right here.

3187
02:10:34,290 --> 02:10:36,390
Oh, where am I grabbing?

3188
02:10:36,570 --> 02:10:37,250
Is that...

3189
02:10:39,650 --> 02:10:40,770
Want some of this?

3190
02:10:42,110 --> 02:10:44,470
You want some of that tomato juice?

3191
02:10:44,730 --> 02:10:46,630
No, I shouldn't say that.

3192
02:10:48,010 --> 02:10:48,610
Shit.

3193
02:10:48,810 --> 02:10:50,030
It's not fair.

3194
02:10:50,230 --> 02:10:50,910
Like, come on.

3195
02:10:51,470 --> 02:10:53,010
Oh, manly duo.

3196
02:10:53,370 --> 02:10:53,970
Okay.

3197
02:10:54,350 --> 02:10:55,470
Hand on heart?

3198
02:10:55,810 --> 02:10:56,530
What is that?

3199
02:10:57,450 --> 02:10:58,990
Oh, like that.

3200
02:10:59,330 --> 02:10:59,710
Oh!

3201
02:11:00,690 --> 02:11:01,790
Leg out.

3202
02:11:02,090 --> 02:11:02,490
Oh!

3203
02:11:03,850 --> 02:11:04,450
Girl!

3204
02:11:05,090 --> 02:11:06,450
I already leg out.

3205
02:11:10,120 --> 02:11:10,720
Okay.

3206
02:11:13,080 --> 02:11:13,680
Yes!

3207
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:15,600
Yes!

3208
02:11:15,800 --> 02:11:16,800
Leg out.

3209
02:11:16,860 --> 02:11:17,580
What was the number?

3210
02:11:17,680 --> 02:11:18,400
What was the number?

3211
02:11:18,500 --> 02:11:18,740
Guys!

3212
02:11:18,940 --> 02:11:19,760
Guys, I forgot!

3213
02:11:19,860 --> 02:11:20,440
I forgot the number!

3214
02:11:20,620 --> 02:11:21,140
888!

3215
02:11:21,380 --> 02:11:22,380
Oh, yes!

3216
02:11:25,360 --> 02:11:26,880
That's fucking right.

3217
02:11:27,020 --> 02:11:27,740
Easy.

3218
02:11:33,020 --> 02:11:33,760
Absolutely...

3219
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:36,620
Absolutely insane fit, girl.

3220
02:11:38,360 --> 02:11:39,100
Insane...

3221
02:11:39,100 --> 02:11:40,720
What... What doki is this?

3222
02:11:41,120 --> 02:11:43,180
Which doki is this doki?

3223
02:11:43,460 --> 02:11:44,140
The...

3224
02:11:44,860 --> 02:11:45,800
One star.

3225
02:11:46,860 --> 02:11:48,760
You're not gonna be in the...

3226
02:11:48,760 --> 02:11:50,580
You're not gonna be in the board of doki.

3227
02:11:50,660 --> 02:11:51,440
That's for sure.

3228
02:11:52,100 --> 02:11:52,740
Don't worry.

3229
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:52,920
No.

3230
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:54,020
You don't call us.

3231
02:11:54,120 --> 02:11:54,880
We'll call you.

3232
02:11:57,840 --> 02:11:58,720
Which doki?

3233
02:11:58,880 --> 02:11:59,600
I tried it.

3234
02:11:59,660 --> 02:11:59,840
Oh!

3235
02:11:59,900 --> 02:12:00,760
Summer outfit!

3236
02:12:02,740 --> 02:12:03,620
Two stars.

3237
02:12:04,040 --> 02:12:05,560
Wouldn't they have a green shirt?

3238
02:12:05,680 --> 02:12:05,960
You know what?

3239
02:12:06,040 --> 02:12:06,820
There's green in...

3240
02:12:06,820 --> 02:12:07,440
There's a green shirt.

3241
02:12:07,520 --> 02:12:08,020
One star.

3242
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:12,280
Summer doki.

3243
02:12:12,740 --> 02:12:13,200
The...

3244
02:12:13,200 --> 02:12:13,720
Oh!

3245
02:12:17,500 --> 02:12:18,620
You know what?

3246
02:12:19,440 --> 02:12:20,260
Five stars.

3247
02:12:20,260 --> 02:12:20,300
Five stars.

3248
02:12:20,300 --> 02:12:21,100
That's...

3249
02:12:21,100 --> 02:12:21,480
That's...

3250
02:12:21,480 --> 02:12:22,700
Girl doki...

3251
02:12:23,300 --> 02:12:24,000
Doki...

3252
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:25,500
Here's our card.

3253
02:12:26,880 --> 02:12:30,660
I hope you take our offer to be on the board of dokis.

3254
02:12:32,360 --> 02:12:33,580
Oh my god.

3255
02:12:33,620 --> 02:12:34,560
That's so good.

3256
02:12:34,720 --> 02:12:36,540
Why do I not have shoes?

3257
02:12:36,720 --> 02:12:39,520
I tried making them from memory and failed?

3258
02:12:39,840 --> 02:12:41,720
I'm literally right here.

3259
02:12:42,240 --> 02:12:42,840
Like...

3260
02:12:42,840 --> 02:12:44,640

3261
02:12:45,160 --> 02:12:45,860
I'm...

3262
02:12:45,860 --> 02:12:48,840
I'm literally streaming right now.

3263
02:12:49,200 --> 02:12:49,920
What are you...

3264
02:12:54,520 --> 02:12:55,160
I'm watching you guys.

3265
02:12:55,160 --> 02:12:55,360
What do you...

3266
02:12:55,360 --> 02:12:56,380
What do you...

3267
02:12:56,380 --> 02:12:57,080
What do you mean?

3268
02:12:57,340 --> 02:13:00,140
I tried making her from memory.

3269
02:13:01,700 --> 02:13:02,020
Like...

3270
02:13:04,300 --> 02:13:08,880
That girl was not pixie dookie or something.

3271
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:09,940
I don't...

3272
02:13:09,940 --> 02:13:10,860
Guys.

3273
02:13:12,020 --> 02:13:14,560
Are you guys sandbagging for me to win?

3274
02:13:14,780 --> 02:13:15,200
Are you...

3275
02:13:16,220 --> 02:13:20,040
Oh, I like this.

3276
02:13:20,080 --> 02:13:20,280
This is it.

3277
02:13:20,300 --> 02:13:20,520
That was cute.

3278
02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:23,100
I like the... Oh my god, that's so cute!

3279
02:13:24,520 --> 02:13:28,960
Wait, that is so cute on my phone because I have a problem!

3280
02:13:32,840 --> 02:13:34,260
Oh, I like that.

3281
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:34,760
That's cute.

3282
02:13:34,840 --> 02:13:35,800
Okay, CROQI.

3283
02:13:36,160 --> 02:13:36,680
Okay.

3284
02:13:40,300 --> 02:13:44,520
Wait, what did you say that got censored?

3285
02:13:45,300 --> 02:13:47,100
Was CROQI censored?

3286
02:13:47,100 --> 02:13:51,420
Like... Is CROQI censored?

3287
02:13:55,180 --> 02:13:57,580
Wait, that's so good!

3288
02:13:58,120 --> 02:14:01,060
CROQI, my beloved, we are like this.

3289
02:14:02,220 --> 02:14:04,800
This game is paid to win!

3290
02:14:07,900 --> 02:14:10,580
Oh, the accent.

3291
02:14:11,240 --> 02:14:11,740
God.

3292
02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:14,500
Alright, voting complete.

3293
02:14:15,360 --> 02:14:17,020
Oh, it's the round!

3294
02:14:17,100 --> 02:14:17,340
I'm so happy!

3295
02:14:18,520 --> 02:14:20,720
What the fuck is that?

3296
02:14:22,820 --> 02:14:26,940
From another Dokiverse, keep believing, dream as hard as you can.

3297
02:14:27,140 --> 02:14:29,860
The lashes are on fleek.

3298
02:14:30,780 --> 02:14:33,080
Sorry, I gave you one star because I wasn't paying attention.

3299
02:14:33,840 --> 02:14:36,000
Did I mean that you were one star?

3300
02:14:36,060 --> 02:14:36,920
Oh, wait!

3301
02:14:37,860 --> 02:14:39,400
That's current Doki.

3302
02:14:40,500 --> 02:14:43,900
Oh my god, five stars because it's current Doki.

3303
02:14:48,320 --> 02:14:51,260
Oh my god, she's serving.

3304
02:14:51,360 --> 02:14:51,800
That's right.

3305
02:14:51,880 --> 02:14:52,820
She's serving that.

3306
02:14:53,420 --> 02:14:54,180
See.

3307
02:14:56,100 --> 02:14:57,000
Who's this?

3308
02:14:57,740 --> 02:14:59,300
Doki Man Bird.

3309
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:03,700
Please give me the honor of being an official Dokiverse character.

3310
02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:06,420
Doki Man Bird!

3311
02:15:08,780 --> 02:15:13,420
You have to be specific about the gender of birds.

3312
02:15:13,820 --> 02:15:14,420
Like...

3313
02:15:16,220 --> 02:15:17,480
Doki Bird!

3314
02:15:17,660 --> 02:15:18,160
Doki Bird!

3315
02:15:18,160 --> 02:15:18,980
That's a new...

3316
02:15:18,980 --> 02:15:19,640
Yes!

3317
02:15:23,440 --> 02:15:24,080
Nice.

3318
02:15:24,780 --> 02:15:26,020
That's fucking right.

3319
02:15:26,140 --> 02:15:28,940
Wait, I can literally make a private server and just farm.

3320
02:15:30,080 --> 02:15:31,500
Guys, I can...

3321
02:15:31,500 --> 02:15:31,980
Wait.

3322
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:34,120
This is actually pay to win.

3323
02:15:34,640 --> 02:15:35,500
I can...

3324
02:15:35,500 --> 02:15:39,140
I can literally have a custom server and then like...

3325
02:15:39,140 --> 02:15:41,060
I can farm 3000.

3326
02:15:42,160 --> 02:15:43,440
Holy shit.

3327
02:15:43,440 --> 02:15:44,960
Guys, guys, guys.

3328
02:15:45,120 --> 02:15:46,780
All the Dokis, take a picture right here.

3329
02:15:47,260 --> 02:15:49,780
Guys, before the timer's up, all the Dokis!

3330
02:15:50,340 --> 02:15:51,280
Get over here!

3331
02:15:51,480 --> 02:15:52,880
We gotta take a picture!

3332
02:15:55,400 --> 02:15:55,840
Guys!

3333
02:15:57,040 --> 02:15:57,880
Not you.

3334
02:15:58,060 --> 02:15:59,020
Not Uzi.

3335
02:15:59,080 --> 02:15:59,740
You're not Doki.

3336
02:15:59,800 --> 02:16:00,320
I'm joking.

3337
02:16:00,660 --> 02:16:01,480
I'm joking.

3338
02:16:01,560 --> 02:16:02,740
I'm gonna be front and center.

3339
02:16:03,040 --> 02:16:03,720
Alright, guys.

3340
02:16:03,880 --> 02:16:05,220
Wade, get back here, Wade!

3341
02:16:05,480 --> 02:16:06,780
Wade, you tapped out!

3342
02:16:06,880 --> 02:16:07,280
Wade!

3343
02:16:08,920 --> 02:16:09,360
Okay.

3344
02:16:09,760 --> 02:16:10,800
Alright, we're gonna be here.

3345
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:11,300
Alright, guys.

3346
02:16:11,360 --> 02:16:11,840
Do a pose.

3347
02:16:11,840 --> 02:16:12,860
Alright, nice.

3348
02:16:13,100 --> 02:16:13,520
Alright, guys.

3349
02:16:13,540 --> 02:16:14,040
Take a picture.

3350
02:16:14,320 --> 02:16:14,840
Alright.

3351
02:16:14,920 --> 02:16:16,240
Take a picture, everybody.

3352
02:16:16,980 --> 02:16:17,580
That's right.

3353
02:16:17,800 --> 02:16:19,780
With all the Dokis and Wade.

3354
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:25,160
Wade is literally tapped out right now.

3355
02:16:25,480 --> 02:16:27,160
Holy shit.

3356
02:16:27,540 --> 02:16:28,060
Alright.

3357
02:16:28,440 --> 02:16:28,960
GG's.

3358
02:16:29,280 --> 02:16:29,980
GG's, guys.

3359
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:30,620
I'm done.

3360
02:16:30,860 --> 02:16:31,700
I'm done.

3361
02:16:31,700 --> 02:16:32,840
I'm done with Roblox.

3362
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:35,480
Oh my god.

3363
02:16:35,500 --> 02:16:37,600
I can't believe I spent 100 Roblox.

3364
02:16:37,640 --> 02:16:38,220
I'm fucking...

3365
02:16:38,220 --> 02:16:39,980
Let me cancel my Roblox.

3366
02:16:39,980 --> 02:16:41,820
Let me cancel my Roblox.

3367
02:16:43,540 --> 02:16:45,920
Guys, I need to cancel my Roblox server.

3368
02:16:46,220 --> 02:16:46,720
So I...

3369
02:16:46,720 --> 02:16:48,560
Because it's like a monthly server.

3370
02:16:48,720 --> 02:16:52,620
And I need to be sure that I don't get charged.

3371
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:54,180
Okay, guys.

3372
02:16:54,400 --> 02:16:55,280
Have fun.

3373
02:16:55,400 --> 02:16:56,860
You guys can have...

3374
02:16:57,480 --> 02:16:59,240
Guys, have fun, everybody.

3375
02:16:59,540 --> 02:17:01,060
For an entire month.

3376
02:17:01,140 --> 02:17:03,900
It expires on August 27th.

3377
02:17:03,920 --> 02:17:08,740
You guys can play Trested Impress on the No Kids Allowed server.

3378
02:17:14,380 --> 02:17:15,580
You guys...

3379
02:17:15,580 --> 02:17:18,380
You guys get the No Kids Allowed.

3380
02:17:18,600 --> 02:17:21,800
There will be no children allowed in that server.

3381
02:17:22,100 --> 02:17:22,760
I'll...

3382
02:17:22,760 --> 02:17:23,200
I'll...

3383
02:17:23,580 --> 02:17:26,620
If there's a child, I will kick them out.

3384
02:17:27,180 --> 02:17:27,740
Alright.

3385
02:17:27,820 --> 02:17:28,440
I challenged...

3386
02:17:28,440 --> 02:17:29,520
I canceled the subscription.

3387
02:17:30,480 --> 02:17:31,600
Renewal canceled.

3388
02:17:31,740 --> 02:17:32,920
Thank fucking god.

3389
02:17:35,800 --> 02:17:37,040
I'm not...

3390
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:39,980
I'm not letting the children ruin this...

3391
02:17:39,980 --> 02:17:41,180
ruin this for me.

3392
02:17:41,300 --> 02:17:41,520
Okay.

3393
02:17:41,820 --> 02:17:42,640
Oh my god.

3394
02:17:42,700 --> 02:17:43,400
That's fun though.

3395
02:17:43,440 --> 02:17:44,000
That's fun.

3396
02:17:44,140 --> 02:17:44,980
Now I understand why...

3397
02:17:44,980 --> 02:17:47,440
Now I understand why this game was so popular.

3398
02:17:49,260 --> 02:17:50,840
Thank you for the Akasupa.

3399
02:17:51,060 --> 02:17:51,420
Thank you.

3400
02:17:51,440 --> 02:17:51,860
Thank you.

3401
02:17:51,860 --> 02:17:53,920
Hope this helps as much as the Robux.

3402
02:17:53,980 --> 02:17:54,950
Thank you for the Akasupa.

3403
02:17:55,820 --> 02:17:56,440
Thank you.

3404
02:17:56,440 --> 02:17:57,140
Thank you.

3405
02:17:57,400 --> 02:18:00,660
Donkey Farms showed you for money and rents for getting cake.

3406
02:18:01,260 --> 02:18:02,680
Thank you for the super chat.

3407
02:18:02,780 --> 02:18:03,120
Thank you.

3408
02:18:03,160 --> 02:18:03,740
Thank you.

3409
02:18:03,800 --> 02:18:05,300
You don't understand.

3410
02:18:06,900 --> 02:18:09,240
It's not even my fault.

3411
02:18:09,860 --> 02:18:11,800
It's not even my fault.

3412
02:18:11,800 --> 02:18:14,620
That like I didn't know the theme.

3413
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:15,440
I was not...

3414
02:18:15,440 --> 02:18:19,240
I joined in the server and nobody said anything.

3415
02:18:19,860 --> 02:18:23,340
Nobody said anything.

3416
02:18:24,500 --> 02:18:29,700
I was just making fun of people for having dog shit...

3417
02:18:29,700 --> 02:18:34,300
dog shit outfits.

3418
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,140
Because I was like, oh look at these guys.

3419
02:18:37,240 --> 02:18:37,620
Not...

3420
02:18:37,620 --> 02:18:38,240
Not...

3421
02:18:38,800 --> 02:18:40,720
Not having the right clothes.

3422
02:18:44,560 --> 02:18:45,120
Like really...

3423
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:45,220
I have a really normal їх, I hate that.

3424
02:18:45,220 --> 02:18:45,500
I don't know why they're like...

3425
02:18:45,500 --> 02:18:48,240
I didn't pay attention, I thought it was like three of them.

3426
02:18:48,440 --> 02:18:50,440
I didn't realize all twenty...

3427
02:18:50,440 --> 02:18:53,380
All thirteen of them wasn't following the theme.

3428
02:18:53,720 --> 02:18:55,800
How was I supposed to know?

3429
02:19:00,680 --> 02:19:02,580
Oh yeah, that's fun though.

3430
02:19:02,680 --> 02:19:03,280
That's a lot of fun.

3431
02:19:03,560 --> 02:19:06,860
Uh, I am gonna call it here guys.

3432
02:19:07,200 --> 02:19:08,100
I am tired.

3433
02:19:08,100 --> 02:19:08,620
I'm tired.

3434
02:19:09,120 --> 02:19:10,760
I'm gonna take a nap now.

3435
02:19:11,100 --> 02:19:16,580
But it was a great time playing Dressed to Impress.

3436
02:19:16,600 --> 02:19:22,140
And now I know why this game was super popular amongst the adults and the children.

3437
02:19:22,960 --> 02:19:24,880
So I hope you guys had fun as well!

3438
02:19:25,340 --> 02:19:26,980
Oh yeah, for those who don't know...

3439
02:19:26,980 --> 02:19:27,420
Oh yeah, I forgot.

3440
02:19:27,520 --> 02:19:30,580
I lost my train of thought regarding the K-So Tyler 1 shit.

3441
02:19:30,580 --> 02:19:39,440
So like in every generation, we will always have a streamer that likes to scream and yell at things and rage a lot.

3442
02:19:39,600 --> 02:19:45,060
But he's also a really good way for chat to bully as well.

3443
02:19:45,140 --> 02:19:51,400
He's like a really good streamer for chat to bully the streamer.

3444
02:19:51,420 --> 02:19:56,340
And each generation has its own version of that streamer.

3445
02:19:56,440 --> 02:19:58,240
The current one is K-So.

3446
02:19:58,340 --> 02:20:00,040
What I had was Tyler 1.

3447
02:20:04,970 --> 02:20:07,150
But yes, I'm gonna head off now everybody.

3448
02:20:07,310 --> 02:20:08,350
I think I read a lot of super chat.

3449
02:20:08,410 --> 02:20:09,350
Yeah, like a punching bag.

3450
02:20:09,590 --> 02:20:12,210
It's called the streamer... the punching bag streamer.

3451
02:20:12,310 --> 02:20:12,710
Exactly.

3452
02:20:13,070 --> 02:20:16,810
Anyway guys, I had a lot of fun today.

3453
02:20:16,930 --> 02:20:19,230
As always everybody, stay hydrated.

3454
02:20:19,810 --> 02:20:20,430
Posture check.

3455
02:20:20,510 --> 02:20:22,330
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3456
02:20:22,470 --> 02:20:24,830
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

3457
02:20:24,970 --> 02:20:26,210
Because you deserve it!

3458
02:20:26,330 --> 02:20:27,510
I'll see you guys next time everybody!

3459
02:20:28,070 --> 02:20:28,710
Bye guys!

3460
02:20:29,470 --> 02:20:29,870
Bye!
