1
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,500
Hello, everybody.

2
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,080
Hello, hello.

3
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,620
Yes, I unfortunately had to loop because I am very tired.

4
00:03:50,900 --> 00:04:00,560
I just recently brought groceries up to my apartment because the place I ordered did not bring groceries up.

5
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,140
They just leave it at the lobby.

6
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:13,140
So I had to do it one by... there was like nine bags slash boxes that move up by myself to my apartment.

7
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,860
So my arms are very tired.

8
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,100
And like, so I asked, like, the desk.

9
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,940
I was like, can you guys help me move this?

10
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,520
And then they're like, sorry, we can't.

11
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,060
We have to look.

12
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,740
We have to, like, you know, be at the desk just in case someone needs us.

13
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,580
I was like, okay, can you just make sure nobody steals my food while I bring this up?

14
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:43,600
Like, I was just like... I was just like, can you just make sure nobody steals this?

15
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:45,560
Like...

16
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,180
I didn't think they don't bring it up.

17
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:49,640
Okay.

18
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,340
All right.

19
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,400
I'll start from the beginning.

20
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,280
So, um, I had to do a grocery.

21
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,920
I ordered groceries last night.

22
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,480
Um, usually I order from Savon Food.

23
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:05,100
Um, because that's like, you know, um, that's like usually the Canadian place to go.

24
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:14,480
Um, and I was just like, okay, I... I was like thinking to myself, man, I miss Asian supermarkets.

25
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,780
I miss Asian food deliveries.

26
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,360
I'm so sad.

27
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:24,100
Why won't Asian supermarkets also do deliveries and stuff?

28
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,480
Just... just like these Western supermarkets.

29
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,340
Because if... okay, for the Asians out there who live in Canada, TNT.

30
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,320
TNT is our boy.

31
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,440
All the Asians in Canada know what I mean.

32
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:52,220
So, I was like, man, why can't they have TNT... why can't TNT also do deliveries?

33
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,080
And then, like, I was like, wait a minute.

34
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,220
I never checked the website.

35
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,380
And I googled TNT.

36
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,540
And they were like, TNT does do deliveries.

37
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,520
And I was like, oh my god, I never have to shop for it.

38
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:06,940
I'm sorry.

39
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,900
I never have to do...

40
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,940
I never did to do...

41
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,820
Western grocery shopping ever again!

42
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,860
Oh my god!

43
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,860
I was like, okay, Doki, pick your words wisely on what you say.

44
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,180
I was like, okay, Doki, pick your words before you say anything else.

45
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:45,960
So, TNT is basically, it's like H Mart for Americans.

46
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,140
Because I didn't know what the fuck H Mart was.

47
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,820
But for us, we have something similar.

48
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,760
And it's called TNT.

49
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:59,000
And so, I love TNT because I grew up shopping there.

50
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:07,160
Like, my parents grew up, like, I grew up with my parents taking me there to, like, for, like, grocery shopping and everything.

51
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:21,300
And it basically has a lot of, like, Asian, like, you know, mostly, like, Chinese dishes or, like, Chinese groceries and stuff.

52
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:32,340
So, that's where you go, um, that's where you go for, uh, for, for basically, like, the Asian market and stuff.

53
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,320
Um, or is it K Mart?

54
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,020
Or is it H Mart?

55
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,580
I don't know.

56
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,900
One of my American friends told me, like, oh, it's, like, something Mart.

57
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,960
And I was just like, what?

58
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,940
I was like, the fuck is that?

59
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,300
The fuck is that?

60
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:49,640
No.

61
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,880
We have what is called TNT.

62
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:52,740
Anyway.

63
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,200
So, um, I don't know.

64
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,840
Um, I don't know.

65
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,380
So, um, I was, I was so excited.

66
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,080
But I already ordered groceries from Save On Food.

67
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,320
But I was like, you know what?

68
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:03,760
Fuck it.

69
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,540
I'm desperate.

70
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,280
I haven't.

71
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,600
I was like, I was like, I'm fucking desperate.

72
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,680
It's been so long since I have, like, tea eggs.

73
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,160
Since I had, like, bolo bao.

74
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,400
Or, like, the, uh, lap chun gao.

75
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,720
I was like, it's been so long.

76
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,880
I need it.

77
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,280
And I was like, fuck it.

78
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,640
I'll order again.

79
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:45,620
So, um, so I ordered, uh, I ordered, like, from Save On Food, which is for, you know, you know, the typical things I order on Save On Food, as if I was not Asian.

80
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:52,380
Um, which was bread and some deli meats and some, some spinach.

81
00:08:52,800 --> 00:09:04,290
You know, all that boring shit, you know, like, like, all, like, you know, the, the cold cuts, all that boring shit over there.

82
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:17,170
And then, on TNT, I was like, oh my god, I ordered, like, like, dan ka, like, egg tarts, tea eggs, um, um, some, those, like, curry blocks.

83
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:24,070
Uh, I ordered, like, um, bulldog noodles, like, all different flavors of bulldog noodles.

84
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:29,170
I ordered authentic wudong noodles, so I can put, like, you know, the ones where you have to put it in the freezer.

85
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:35,210
I ordered, like, the fish sumai that you can just microwave, all that shit.

86
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,010
I was like, oh, I'm in, I'm, I'm, I'm, I was so happy.

87
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:38,570
Yep.

88
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,510
I was so, I was so fucking happy.

89
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,370
I was like, I can't believe they deliver.

90
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:46,890
You don't understand.

91
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:55,590
It blew my mind when I found out they, I, like, spent around $250 on just groceries.

92
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,030
Like, from TNT.

93
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:04,230
I was just like, and I got, like, the, I got, like, mong, monggo poutine, like, mango pudding.

94
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:12,390
I got, like, uh, I got, like, um, some Samyong noodles.

95
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,330
I got, like, kimchi.

96
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,210
Uh, no, I spent a lot.

97
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,150
I was, you don't understand.

98
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:29,290
I was so desperate for, like, like, an Asian, like, because, like, all the Asian supermarkets are really far from me.

99
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,970
So I don't want to, like, you know, take an Uber.

100
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,850
Uh, I didn't want to take an Uber just to go to an Asian supermarket.

101
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,530
And just to, like, and then have to bring it all back as well.

102
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,610
I have to carry all that back.

103
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,910
So I was like, oh, my God.

104
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:45,070
I can actually order from the comfort of my own home.

105
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:50,430
And then, like, I'll never have to do Uber Eats order again for at least a month.

106
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,950
I was like, oh, my God.

107
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:56,850
I'll never have to do Uber Eats for at least a month.

108
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,830
Oh, and I also ordered, um, barbecue duck.

109
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:00,570
Oh, my God.

110
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,410
I took a bite out of that barbecue duck.

111
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,770
I was, like, transported back to Hong Kong.

112
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,210
I was like, oh, there was a lot of oil.

113
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,650
But, like, I was, that's what makes it so good.

114
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,830
Like, the Hong Kong barbecue duck.

115
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,150
Oh, my God.

116
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,090
That was so good.

117
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:24,330
Also, like, um, I know it's weird, but I hate egg yolk from, like, just, like, just the circle from the egg yolk.

118
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:32,690
And, um, I just don't like, I'm okay if the yolk is, like, just, you know, if it's, like, in, like, part of the cuisine.

119
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,690
But if it's just from the egg and stuff, I'm just eating.

120
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,530
Because I like tea eggs.

121
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,090
We don't know what tea eggs are.

122
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,510
Tea eggs are literally just eggs drenched in tea.

123
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,230
But it's really, really good.

124
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,610
It adds, like, a little flavor to it.

125
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,990
Like, an extra flavor to it.

126
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,170
But, like, I hate... I don't like eating the yolk inside.

127
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,530
So, I literally just... I like eating the, like, the outer part.

128
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,170
I just hate the yolk taste of it, of the egg itself.

129
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,290
So, I literally just opened it and then just gave the yolk to dad.

130
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,910
I was like, here, you can have this.

131
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,730
I was like, fuck that.

132
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,150
Oh, and then, I also got...

133
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,390
I was like, oh, my God.

134
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,230
Oh, lemon tea.

135
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,770
I was like, oh, my God.

136
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,570
I haven't seen those cartons in so long.

137
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:19,650
If you know, you know the Vita... the Vita lemon tea and then the Vita...

138
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,390
Oh, sorry.

139
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,290
I'm just going really Asian right now.

140
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:28,210
And I... and also, there was... I don't worry.

141
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:32,390
I didn't forget to order... I didn't forget to order spam.

142
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,570
Every Asian meal needs spam.

143
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,230
Because I'm definitely going to be cooking.

144
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,590
Oh, there's so many, like, different types of noodles.

145
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,150
And then, um...

146
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:45,250
The only thing I'm missing right now is, like, a rice cooker.

147
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,770
I was telling my friends.

148
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:47,710
I was like...

149
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,270
I was like, okay, I just...

150
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,130
The only thing I forgot to buy is, like, a rice cooker.

151
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,970
And then my friend was like, why don't you use a pot?

152
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,210
I was like, are you fucking stupid?

153
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,550
I was like, pots are not for rice.

154
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,130
They are for noodles.

155
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,610
I was like, are you fucking stupid?

156
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:13,370
Like, they're not for rice.

157
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,230
They are for noodles.

158
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:21,190
What the fuck did you say to me?

159
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,770
I was like, I don't want a coconut pot.

160
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:23,850
What?

161
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,390
That's not Asian.

162
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,390
And then my friend was like, stop being Asian.

163
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,470
I like...

164
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:34,650
So...

165
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,270
Um...

166
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:39,770
Uh, so I just need to buy a rice cooker for all the shit I bought.

167
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:43,190
Because I have everything but a rice cooker.

168
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,350
Um...

169
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:48,710
Oh, and I also got marinated beef shank, too.

170
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,010
And also...

171
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,250
Okay, I should stop.

172
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,670
I'm pretty sure I'm making everybody so hungry.

173
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:54,170
Right now.

174
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:54,690
I'm sorry.

175
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,990
I was just so excited.

176
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,190
The only downside...

177
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,270
Out of all of this...

178
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,770
Was the fact...

179
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:02,290
That, like...

180
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,550
They wouldn't bring it up to my apartment.

181
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,070
That was, like...

182
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:06,970
The one thing.

183
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,530
Like, that's, like, the one...

184
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,090
The biggest deal breaker.

185
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,690
Like, if I ever do this order...

186
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,090
Like, a month's supply of food...

187
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:16,750
Um...

188
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,470
I have to...

189
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,970
I have to bring everything up myself.

190
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:22,210
Um...

191
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:22,590
So...

192
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,370
That's what makes me the most sad.

193
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:25,070
Uh...

194
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,970
So, that's why I'm, like, extra tired.

195
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:28,210
Because...

196
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:29,530
Um...

197
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:32,450
Because my arms are really, really tired right now.

198
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,010
Ha ha ha!

199
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,150
I do have...

200
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,510
I do have a trolley, though.

201
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:37,490
I just...

202
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,310
I thought that they would help me bring it up.

203
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,830
So, I didn't bring the trolley down.

204
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:46,110
Because I legitimately thought they were gonna bring it up.

205
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:46,850
I...

206
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:47,250
Like...

207
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,330
I don't know.

208
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,790
That's the only issue I have with TNT deliveries.

209
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,430
Is that they don't bring up my food.

210
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:55,990
Save on Food does.

211
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,750
Save on Food, like...

212
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,610
Has a guy.

213
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:01,270
I just need to put a box outside my door.

214
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:05,410
And then the Save on Food delivery guys literally go up to my apartment.

215
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,410
And then they just, like, put all the food in a box.

216
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,270
And then I just sign a thing and I'm good.

217
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,310
Like...

218
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:11,670
That's...

219
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,730
I'm just, like...

220
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,870
But, like, all I get is, like, deli cuts.

221
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:15,550
Like...

222
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,490
Ha ha ha!

223
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,450
Ha ha ha!

224
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,510
I was like...

225
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,030
But it's not the same.

226
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:21,750
It's like...

227
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,310
Do I trade the quality of food with...

228
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:25,790
With...

229
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,690
With the fact that I have to bring it all up myself?

230
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:29,990
Like...

231
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,030
Ha ha ha!

232
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,910
I was just...

233
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,330
I was just like...

234
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,090
Oh, man.

235
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,730
The quality of food versus bringing everything up myself.

236
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:37,330
I...

237
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,030
It's such a hard choice.

238
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,150
Am I...

239
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,750
Ha ha ha!

240
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,560
The pros versus cons of it all.

241
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:48,940
Um...

242
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,080
Okay.

243
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,760
So, also, another life update.

244
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,660
I still have only two monitors.

245
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,000
Uh...

246
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,320
Ha ha ha!

247
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:54,840
Ha ha!

248
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,280
I still...

249
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,320
Have only...

250
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,020
Uh...

251
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,900
Two monitors.

252
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,620
Because, um...

253
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,280
So, like, today, I was like...

254
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:04,820
You know what?

255
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,040
I'm gonna do it.

256
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,320
I'm gonna try and, like...

257
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,760
Piece my...

258
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,000
Get a new monitor...

259
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,760
Get my new monitor that's in a box from MSI.

260
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,080
And, like...

261
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,080
Because, obviously, like...

262
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,600
I have...

263
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,520
I've done a couple of MSI sponsors of MSI monitors.

264
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,980
So, of course, I got those monitors for free.

265
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:23,460
You know?

266
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,060
Like...

267
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,560
That would be really fucked up if I did.

268
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,560
Ha ha ha!

269
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,660
Ha ha ha!

270
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,620
Ha ha ha!

271
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,020
Ha ha!

272
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:29,240
Ha ha!

273
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:29,280
Ha ha!

274
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,320
Um...

275
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,080
So, I was just like...

276
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,260
Okay.

277
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,520
Because that third monitor is usually where I put my chat in.

278
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,980
Because my second monitor...

279
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,860
There's not enough room.

280
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,700
There's not really another...

281
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,920
There's not really a lot of room for, like...

282
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,780
Uh...

283
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,940
For, like...

284
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:46,860
Uh...

285
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,420
Everything.

286
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,240
So, that's where I put my third monitor.

287
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:49,760
So, I can...

288
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,700
Right side, I can look at chat.

289
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,920
Left side is where my...

290
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,140
I configure everything.

291
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:54,800
Um...

292
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,460
So, I was just like...

293
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:56,700
Okay.

294
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,020
I'm gonna...

295
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,780
I'm gonna do it.

296
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,660
I was like, I'm a strong, independent VTuber.

297
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,940
I can do this.

298
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,920
I can, like, unscrew a monitor and screw in a new monitor.

299
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,520
How hard can it be?

300
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,680
So, my thumb hurts.

301
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:23,380
Long story short, my hand is sore and my thumb hurts right now.

302
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,440
And I found out it was very hard.

303
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:41,060
So, if you guys didn't know, I have two monitors and not a third monitor.

304
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,640
So, we all know what that means.

305
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,880
That it didn't go so very well.

306
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,520
It didn't go very well.

307
00:17:53,380 --> 00:18:04,860
Um, so, um, I tried very hard to, like, unscrew the screwdriver, you know, so I could get that monitor off the arm.

308
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,560
Off the, um, off the monitor arm.

309
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,900
Dork, no monitors rather in the making of this task.

310
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,960
Only Doki's fingers.

311
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,980
Thank you for the super chat.

312
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:17,380
Thank you.

313
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,020
Thank you.

314
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,020
Scrooge, thank you for the super chat.

315
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:20,300
Thank you.

316
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:20,760
Thank you.

317
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,780
Independent, sure.

318
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:22,380
Strong?

319
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,120
Nope.

320
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,240
Thank you for the super chat.

321
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:24,640
Thank you.

322
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,120
Thank you.

323
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:25,720
Okay.

324
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:33,280
So, um, I was unfortunately not able to unscrew any of the screws.

325
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:38,180
I had to, I also forgot, like, which way you're supposed to unscrew.

326
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:44,300
So, I literally went on Google and was, like, Googling, which way do I unscrew a screw?

327
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,740
So, yeah.

328
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:55,580
You know, they're, like, righty-tighty, lefty- I've never heard of this, by the way, because I'm not a handyman.

329
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,360
I...

330
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:05,260
That's actually the first time I've heard of righty-tighty, lefty-loosey was on Google today.

331
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,480
I was like, oh, wait, that's- that's pretty clever.

332
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:21,780
That's- So, um, so, I- I ordered an electric screwdriver on Amazon, so I'm gonna try it again tomorrow.

333
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:33,860
I'm gonna- I'm gonna- I'm gonna try it again tomorrow with an electric screwdriver, and maybe it won't work.

334
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,800
Because I was like, what if- if I use an electric screwdriver?

335
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,980
It'll do all the work for me, right?

336
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,500
That's how it goes.

337
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,720
Surely that'll help.

338
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,060
So, I'm gonna see if that works.

339
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:46,860
Um.

340
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,920
It's not- I actually can't unscrew it!

341
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,840
Because the la- my dad screwed it together!

342
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:59,400
My dad screwed the monitor onto the monitor arm!

343
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,700
I don't have the same strength!

344
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,800
I don't have testosterone!

345
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:12,060
I- So, like, he actually screwed it incredibly tight!

346
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,840
I can't- I tried all four of them!

347
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:20,920
I- I tried all four of the screws!

348
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,840
None of it worked!

349
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:33,800
So, um, um, anyway, uh, unfortunately, I do not have the upper body strength, like my dad.

350
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:43,800
Um, so, I got- I ordered- I ordered on Amazon, uh, an electric screwdriver, and I hope to God it works.

351
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:49,680
Because I don't know what's- if- if it doesn't work, I might have to buy a new monitor arm, too.

352
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:59,900
I might need a- I might- I might just order a new monitor arm, and just- I didn't just do that!

353
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,180
Like, I got- I tried something!

354
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,340
I'm just trying to figure out a solution!

355
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:16,220
It's either I do that, or- or- or- I fucking hire a handyman to just work on my monitor!

356
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,940
I feel like a handyman would be more expensive, though.

357
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,040
I- I- I- I don't know!

358
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,800
I don't know what's more expensive!

359
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,820
A handyman?

360
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,840
Or, uh, if I just order a new monitor arm?

361
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,420
Um...

362
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:43,480
I just buy weights and, like, start lifting for, like, a month or two before I could- and then try again after that.

363
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,240
JL!

364
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,220
Thank you for the super chat.

365
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,300
Thank you- thank you!

366
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,140
Uh... I've been there 10 years ago, though.

367
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,160
Uh, um... Anton!

368
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,020
Thank you for the super chat.

369
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,220
Thank you- thank you!

370
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,760
Power tools are very common.

371
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,340
Please make sure you know what you're doing before using power tools!

372
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,040
How hard could it be, Anton?

373
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,100
Thank you, little super chat.

374
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:02,840
Thank you, thank you.

375
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,140
It's just a screwdriver that's electric, right?

376
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,080
There's no way I could get hurt.

377
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,480
Right?

378
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,540
Let me knock on wood.

379
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,140
There's no way, right?

380
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,760
It's... She does... It's a screwdriver!

381
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,500
Like, how bad can it get?

382
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,140
How... How bad can it be for a screwdriver?

383
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:29,140
Like... One... Destroyed... It's okay, I have a spare.

384
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:29,880
onzeher monitor.

385
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:33,160
That's... It doesn't matter if this monitor... dies.

386
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,340
Because it's already dead.

387
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,760
Um... Jen, thank you for the super chat.

388
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,480
Thank you, thank you.

389
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,560
Here's ten dollars for your future wait set.

390
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,280
Next see, thank you for the super chat.

391
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,220
Thank you, thank you.

392
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,780
external Thank you to the super chat.

393
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,060
Thank you.

394
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:45,520
Thank you.

395
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,200
Engineering tip.

396
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,060
I got...

397
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:50,020
With your right hand, with your thumb, point in the direction you want the screw to go.

398
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,980
Then wherever your other hand moves is where you need a screw.

399
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,100
Thank you to the super chat.

400
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:54,500
Thank you.

401
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,200
Thank you.

402
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,080
Okay, that sounds a little difficult.

403
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:57,920
I think...

404
00:22:59,100 --> 00:22:59,700
Don't worry.

405
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:04,020
My electric screwdriver is gonna... is gonna figure it out for me.

406
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,040
Um...

407
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,560
Alright.

408
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,520
Alright, what else do I wanna talk about?

409
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,240
Okay.

410
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:11,680
Uh...

411
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,060
Oh yeah, the announcements.

412
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,580
So you don't follow...

413
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:18,040
If you don't follow YouTube community post or...

414
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,600
And also you don't follow me on Twitter.

415
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,700
Um...

416
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,820
It has been an...

417
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,860
I'm not gonna fucking die!

418
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,400
Like...

419
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,800
It's a screw...

420
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,240
Okay.

421
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,700
Okay, I'm a little paranoid because I just read the Wikipedia on the newest Final Destination movie.

422
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:34,880
So I...

423
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,620
So...

424
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,100
I...

425
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,760
I'm not gonna get Final Destination, guys.

426
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:42,640
Alright.

427
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:43,300
Guys.

428
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:43,900
I...

429
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,420
Don't make me more paranoid or I'm gonna hire a handyman.

430
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,080
I...

431
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,820
I don't know why I...

432
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,700
Now I have a useless electronic screwdriver, chat.

433
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:54,760
I...

434
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,360
Guys.

435
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,940
Look at what you've done.

436
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,980
Now I have a useless electro...

437
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,440
Okay.

438
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:05,280
I didn't wanna mention it, but I ordered two electronic screwdrivers because I didn't know which one was the right one as well.

439
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,280
And then like...

440
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:12,140
I think that's the issue of having disposable income because I ordered two electronic screwdrivers.

441
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,180
Because I was just like...

442
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,380
I was just like...

443
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,580
Which one would work?

444
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,500
One is...

445
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,880
One is like...

446
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,980
Like a gun.

447
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,340
But...

448
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,360
No, I'm not talking about a drill.

449
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,220
Like, I was like...

450
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,540
One is a gun, but the other one is like a pencil.

451
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,840
So I was like...

452
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,800
Which one do I get?

453
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:28,900
I was like...

454
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,500
One is Amazon's choice, but the other one's more expensive.

455
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,980
So it's like...

456
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,840
More expensive equals better?

457
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,000
Or the Amazon choice was 16,000 reviews.

458
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,760
But the other one has like 5,000 reviews.

459
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,080
So I was like...

460
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,280
Okay.

461
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,080
I'll get both.

462
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,260
Because if one doesn't work, I can just use the other one.

463
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:47,980
I...

464
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:55,950
So...

465
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,110
I was like...

466
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,230
I couldn't tell.

467
00:24:58,870 --> 00:24:59,270
I...

468
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,090
I just...

469
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:00,550
I don't know.

470
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,630
I was so confused.

471
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:02,910
And I was already like...

472
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:03,090
You know.

473
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:03,630
I'm...

474
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,870
I'm not very handy.

475
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,030
As you guys can see.

476
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:07,550
And you guys sort of learned.

477
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:07,850
Wait.

478
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,610
I don't know if I can refund it anymore.

479
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,410
When I ordered it...

480
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,810
When I ordered it, they were like...

481
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:14,370
Uh...

482
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:16,130
We can have it there tomorrow.

483
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,670
If you order it within like...

484
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:18,770
Oh, I can.

485
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,430
Okay guys.

486
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:20,290
Do I cancel it?

487
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,950
And just hire a handyman?

488
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,150
Do I just do...

489
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,650
But then he's gonna see how...

490
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,930
I can't even fix it.

491
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:31,010
Not...

492
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:31,330
Yes?

493
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:31,790
Okay.

494
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:32,730
Do I...

495
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:33,950
Do I cancel it?

496
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:36,190
And order a handyman instead?

497
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:37,450
Um...

498
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,070
Usni, thank you for the Akasupa.

499
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:39,710
Thank you.

500
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:40,490
Thank you.

501
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:43,990
Got my first full paycheck from my first job.

502
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,630
Also, what the fucker?

503
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,370
How are you so weak?

504
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:48,590
You are...

505
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,650
It's not my fault!

506
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:51,750
Like...

507
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,490
It's just really difficult!

508
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:54,730
It's not me!

509
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,910
I swear to god!

510
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,630
It's not me!

511
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:58,530
Oh my god.

512
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:02,030
If I'm gonna order a handyman, I should order a different monitor arm.

513
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,650
And just get like a two for one.

514
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:04,830
Because like...

515
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,430
My other monitor arm is sort of like...

516
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:07,870
Broken?

517
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,070
So...

518
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,170
The main one?

519
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:13,830
Because it keeps sliding down.

520
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:15,490
So I keep having to pull it back up.

521
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:17,090
So...

522
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:19,090
I should just order another...

523
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:20,330
I could cancel this one.

524
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,350
And then order a new monitor arm.

525
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,130
And...

526
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,130
For my other two monitors.

527
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:26,270
And...

528
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,030
Wait, but how do I find handyman?

529
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,550
How do I...

530
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,790
There has to be a handyman website somewhere.

531
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,670
Alright, let me cancel this.

532
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:34,950
Can I cancel this?

533
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,550
Are you sure you...

534
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:36,770
Okay.

535
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:37,890
Cancellation.

536
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:39,390
Um...

537
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,190
Items will not arrive in time.

538
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:44,710
Oh.

539
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:45,770
Oh.

540
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:46,310
I need a can...

541
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:46,430
Okay.

542
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:46,910
I'm gonna cancel.

543
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,230
Which one do I cancel, guys?

544
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,110
Do I cancel the gun one?

545
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,870
Or the pencil one?

546
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,390
Or the one that looks like a pencil?

547
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:57,830
Which one do I...

548
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:02,990
But what if I need it?

549
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,290
I'm gonna keep the gun.

550
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,470
That one looks cool.

551
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,050
By the way, speaking of guns...

552
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:08,550
Um...

553
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,590
Sorry, that's a weird segue.

554
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:10,850
Speaking of guns...

555
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:12,050
Um...

556
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:16,070
One of you guys sent me a 3D printed model of my gun.

557
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:19,350
And then it's been stuck in customs for a month now.

558
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,310
It's so...

559
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,250
I just...

560
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,370
I wanted...

561
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,970
I wanted to let you guys know.

562
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:32,470
So, someone made a 3D model of my gun.

563
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:35,090
With like 3D printed bullets as well.

564
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,070
And um...

565
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:40,130
And like, obviously it was sent from America.

566
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,430
Because it went to my P.O.

567
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:42,790
box.

568
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:45,370
Like GamerSubs operates my P.O.

569
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:45,990
box for me.

570
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,650
And um...

571
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,450
And so like...

572
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:50,750
Um...

573
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,570
The worst thing is that...

574
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,850
There's other stuff in that box that I wanted to like...

575
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:56,490
Post about.

576
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:57,470
Because...

577
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,390
I'm gonna tell you guys here.

578
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:59,190
Because I know like...

579
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,730
Some of you guys don't watch like...

580
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,230
My Hit and Run series.

581
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,290
And the thing is that...

582
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:07,650
Wukon actually sent me a care package.

583
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:08,970
Um...

584
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:09,590
Of like...

585
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,550
A bunch of goodies.

586
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,690
To like thank me for playing their game.

587
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,010
So they sent...

588
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,910
Wukon actually sent me a bunch of stuff.

589
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,730
But it was in that box.

590
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:19,970
It was...

591
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:20,970
It was...

592
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:21,850
It was...

593
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:22,690
It was...

594
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:22,770
It was...

595
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,030
In that box.

596
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:24,730
Because my...

597
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:25,550
For my P.O.

598
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:25,830
box.

599
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,050
They pack everything together.

600
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,370
And then send it over.

601
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:29,450
So...

602
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:30,130
It's been...

603
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:32,990
Wukon has been stuck in a month.

604
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:34,470
And they've been like...

605
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,890
Contacting me for like...

606
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:36,950
Hey, we need like...

607
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,410
We need you to fill out these forms.

608
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,400
So like...

609
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:41,810
GamerSource has been like...

610
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,810
Trying to fill these forms out like...

611
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:44,930
Four to five times.

612
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,750
And then it kept getting like...

613
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,030
Rejected and everything.

614
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,370
And...

615
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:50,610
Um...

616
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:51,790
Because they're like...

617
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:52,930
You're missing this information.

618
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,830
We need you to fill it out again.

619
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,790
You're missing this information.

620
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:58,790
We need you to fill it out again.

621
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:00,970
And then after that I had to pay...

622
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,230
Customs fee as well.

623
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,150
I had to pay like...

624
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,030
Almost a hundred dollars.

625
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,210
Because I guess they were like...

626
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:06,030
Mmm...

627
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,850
They're like...

628
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:08,210
I think...

629
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:10,330
So...

630
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:11,130
So, yeah.

631
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,090
It's been stuck in there for a month.

632
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:13,950
But hopefully...

633
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:17,930
It seems like I'll be finally getting it next week.

634
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:19,170
Um...

635
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,150
Because I guess...

636
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,390
I get that they're like...

637
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,210
That's weird.

638
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:23,370
Uh...

639
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,150
That's weird that...

640
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:28,170
A gun is being sent from America.

641
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:29,330
Um...

642
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,750
So...

643
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:34,010
So...

644
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:36,270
But at least I'm getting it next week.

645
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,170
So, yippee!

646
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:38,710
Also, I'll cancel the pencil.

647
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:42,370
The pencil one was more expensive, but then the gun one looks cool.

648
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:43,190
Alright.

649
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,310
I'm canceling.

650
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:47,150
Nice.

651
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:48,530
Do I get my money back?

652
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,310
I don't know if I get my money back.

653
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:53,210
Let me check.

654
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,630
Okay, I don't think they shipped it yet.

655
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:03,310
So, I assume... I assume I get my money back when I cancel.

656
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,970
And they won't go like, yoink.

657
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,850
Angelic, welcome to the tomato farm.

658
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:09,550
Welcome, welcome.

659
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:10,350
Eparation.

660
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,850
I need a job.

661
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:13,730
Thank you for the super chat.

662
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,650
Thank you, thank you.

663
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,290
Fudge, thank you for the super chat.

664
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,330
Thank you, thank you.

665
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,810
Get some protein for those new arms.

666
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:20,810
Doki.

667
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,530
Astrid, thank you for the super chat.

668
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:23,710
Thank you, thank you.

669
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,150
Gus, thank you for the super chat.

670
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:26,830
Thank you, thank you.

671
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:29,830
Jordan to the West is insane with Wukong wielding a clock.

672
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:31,790
Thank you for the super chat.

673
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:32,810
Thank you, thank you.

674
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,170
Alright, anyway.

675
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:35,510
Updates, updates.

676
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,690
Sorry, I forgot to talk about the updates.

677
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:42,110
So, um, cats out of the bag of why I was playing Elden Ring this week.

678
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,430
Sorry, I know I haven't started a game.

679
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,210
It's been 30 minutes.

680
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,810
But, there's a lot of updates that I have to give you guys.

681
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:49,690
So, you guys didn't check Twitter.

682
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:55,390
Um, uh, this is why I had to lure in Elden Ring.

683
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,790
Uh, keep the pencil.

684
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,710
I think the one is more friendly to people who aren't familiar with power tools.

685
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,850
Whoops, that's too late.

686
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,050
I already cancelled the pencil.

687
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:07,830
Oops, I kept the gun because it looked cooler.

688
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,990
Uh, Scrooge, thank you for the super chat.

689
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:11,870
Thank you.

690
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:16,370
Should have said that a little earlier because I chose the gun.

691
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:29,070
Um, so, uh, this is why I had to learn Elden Ring, uh, early because, um, this week.

692
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:32,890
Because, uh, Zentreya, uh, invited me.

693
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,510
I was very surprised with the invitation.

694
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:37,670
Because we all know I'm not known for souls-like.

695
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,970
And I am a cheeser.

696
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,190
Like, I try to take advantage of any advantage I can get.

697
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:43,870
So, uh...

698
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:47,090
So, so, I was just like...

699
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:47,590
Me?

700
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:48,870
Oh my gosh.

701
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:52,410
So, thank you Zentreya for, uh, inviting me.

702
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,290
Because I literally did not expect that.

703
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:56,430
Um...

704
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:57,430
Um...

705
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:00,450
And then she asked me who I wanted to play with.

706
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:01,370
Like, as a third.

707
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,710
I was like, oh, I don't really care.

708
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:04,450
But, like...

709
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:07,010
I know Laimu plays souls-like a lot.

710
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:07,650
And she's really...

711
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:08,570
And she has a brain.

712
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,450
And I don't have a brain.

713
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:11,670
And...

714
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:15,430
And...

715
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:19,130
So, I recommended Laimu or Laimalicious to join us.

716
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,490
Just because I was like, oh, I know she plays souls-like too.

717
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,030
And she's really good at souls-like in general.

718
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:25,150
Um...

719
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,950
So, that's why, uh...

720
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:27,550
Uh...

721
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,430
I...

722
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:29,430
I recommended her.

723
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,510
And then that's how the team came to be.

724
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:32,450
So...

725
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,190
That's great.

726
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:36,450
I know, like, both Zen and Laim plays souls-like a lot.

727
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:37,570
And then there's me.

728
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:38,810
So...

729
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,770
And then I'm there too!

730
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:44,970
Yippee!

731
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:46,850
Um...

732
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:49,930
Anyway, so this is early access to Night Reign.

733
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,050
Apparently it's like a multiplayer game.

734
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,410
Like, with Elden Ring.

735
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:56,690
But it's like, not related at all to Elden Ring.

736
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,730
And there's like, classes or something.

737
00:32:58,990 --> 00:32:59,690
I don't know.

738
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:00,010
I don't...

739
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:02,130
I didn't even, like, read too much into it yet.

740
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,270
Because I do want to be a little surprised.

741
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,590
I just... not a little surprised.

742
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:06,930
Because we have to, like...

743
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,050
Actually try, like...

744
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:08,270
Um...

745
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:09,310
You know...

746
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,870
It's actually, like, an event.

747
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,090
So we have to know what we're doing.

748
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,070
So, like...

749
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,370
But I haven't read anything yet.

750
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:15,670
I'll read something later.

751
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:16,150
I'll...

752
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,710
I'll read about it later.

753
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:18,530
I...

754
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,330
I...

755
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:24,050
I'll read more about it later.

756
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:25,810
Um...

757
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:26,430
But...

758
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:26,590
Yeah.

759
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:27,450
So...

760
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:27,850
It's...

761
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,470
Elden Ring remade as a roguelike.

762
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:30,710
Oh, I like roguelikes.

763
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,350
But yeah.

764
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:32,170
So...

765
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:32,570
Um...

766
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,690
It's a multiplayer...

767
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,430
It's basically an Elder Ring multiplayer game.

768
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:36,270
And...

769
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:36,830
Uh...

770
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,010
It's gonna be really cool.

771
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,290
I can't wait to try it out next week.

772
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,870
I believe it's gonna be on...

773
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:42,590
The...

774
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:42,830
Yeah.

775
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:43,250
I mean...

776
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:43,310
It's...

777
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,350
I believe...

778
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:44,430
I...

779
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,130
I say yes.

780
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,670
It's like literally written on the document.

781
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:47,410
It's...

782
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:49,690
It's on...

783
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:51,390
May 28th.

784
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,330
3 p.m.

785
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:52,830
PST.

786
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:53,950
I'll...

787
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,730
Try and see if I can stream it on YouTube.

788
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,030
Because...

789
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:57,350
Um...

790
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,350
I don't know if I...

791
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:58,750
I don't know.

792
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:59,990
I'll have to ask about it.

793
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:00,790
But I assume I can.

794
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,650
Because I wanna stream this on YouTube instead of Twitch.

795
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:04,610
Um...

796
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:04,990
Therns.

797
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:05,810
Thank you for the super chat.

798
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:06,150
Thank you.

799
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:06,750
Thank you.

800
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,690
Bad news, Doki.

801
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:12,310
You can't heal from having your messages appraised in this one.

802
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:13,110
No!

803
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,810
My streamer build!

804
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,450
That's the only build I know!

805
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:20,790
No!

806
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:25,550
How would I play this game now?

807
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,430
Ruined!

808
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:30,970
But the event is all streamers!

809
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,290
That's the perfect time to use the streamer build!

810
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,210
Alright.

811
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,590
The second announcement!

812
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:37,890
I like how...

813
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:40,790
I'm happy that all of this was announced on the same day.

814
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:41,910
Around the same time.

815
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:43,490
So I can just like go wham bam.

816
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:45,410
Just get it out there instantly.

817
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:46,630
Um...

818
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:47,190
So, yes.

819
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:48,870
Spot the VTuber.

820
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:51,610
Um...

821
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,690
Guess which one's the VTuber?

822
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:55,930
Um...

823
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:56,430
But anyway.

824
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:57,210
Uh...

825
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:59,590
Marvel Rivals has invited me.

826
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:01,710
And a couple of other content creators.

827
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,690
To check out the early access.

828
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:04,650
Um...

829
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:05,850
Earlier than the others.

830
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:06,590
So...

831
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:10,030
I know you guys are like, Oh, but don't you always get to check out the early access.

832
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:10,990
Um...

833
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:11,910
This one is different.

834
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:12,430
When I...

835
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,330
The previous times I get to check early access.

836
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:16,890
It's a bigger pool of streamers.

837
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,850
It's basically anyone that's in the partner program.

838
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:19,790
Um...

839
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:20,210
And...

840
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,190
But I don't get paid for it.

841
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,010
This one.

842
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:22,890
It's a sponsor.

843
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:23,870
I do get paid.

844
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:24,590
Uh...

845
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,270
To stream this.

846
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:25,870
Uh...

847
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:26,210
Early access.

848
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:26,910
And...

849
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:27,210
It's...

850
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:28,410
Two hours earlier.

851
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:29,750
Than everybody else.

852
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:30,870
So like...

853
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:31,870
Um...

854
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,090
There's like...

855
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:33,730
Uh...

856
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:34,510
Twelve of us.

857
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,890
Twelve of us.

858
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:36,530
Can...

859
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:37,490
Is able to stream.

860
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:39,330
Two hours earlier.

861
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:42,390
Than all the other content creators who are in the partner program.

862
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,550
So this is super early access.

863
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,170
And I'm also paid to do it too.

864
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,450
So that's like...

865
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:47,710
Uh...

866
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,830
So it's like double bonus points.

867
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:52,850
Um...

868
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:53,930
So...

869
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:54,470
Um...

870
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,230
We won't be going in straight away...

871
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:56,570
Right away.

872
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:58,470
This will be on Twitch, by the way.

873
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,850
This is my Saturday sponsor.

874
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:02,070
I couldn't announce it until they announced it.

875
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:02,710
So...

876
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,650
This is a Twitch stream.

877
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:05,390
Um...

878
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,610
Because there's gonna be drops on there.

879
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,750
And it is requested to...

880
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,090
Everybody has to be on Twitch.

881
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,190
So...

882
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:10,450
Um...

883
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:12,270
If you guys don't know, my Twitch is DokiBird.

884
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:13,350
Um...

885
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:13,970
And...

886
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:15,210
Uh...

887
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:15,850
Um...

888
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:19,290
We aren't going straight into like a 6v6 right away.

889
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,790
It's gonna be...

890
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:21,130
Um...

891
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,650
It's just gonna be like us individually.

892
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:25,830
If you guys have ever seen like the other early access...

893
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:26,510
Um...

894
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:28,890
The other early access in previous streams.

895
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,190
That they've done with other content creators.

896
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,830
Usually it's like, you know, they check out...

897
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:34,350
Um...

898
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,490
They check out all the updates.

899
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,830
They check out the new hero.

900
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,950
And then they go into like a 6v6 to like try out everything together.

901
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,570
So that's what's gonna be happening.

902
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,950
So it's just gonna be me and you guys checking out...

903
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:53,030
Checking out the skins, checking out all the new updates, the new team-ups, the reworks, Ultron, you know, the Jeff rework and everything.

904
00:36:53,950 --> 00:37:01,290
And then after that, after an hour, we're gonna be going into like a 6v6 thing with the other streamers in this.

905
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,810
So like all these other streamers there.

906
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:10,110
And then like trying, like, you know, trying all of it out like in a team environment.

907
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:15,410
So it's just, it's gonna be one hour individual and then one hour with like the other streamers.

908
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,650
Yes, I know who my team is.

909
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:20,750
So we're having fun.

910
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,610
Just say that.

911
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,270
We're gonna be having fun, guys.

912
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:41,170
I was, it's actually really cool.

913
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:44,490
If you guys didn't know, um...

914
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:49,710
Agent00 and YourRageGaming, I believe they're both in the KaiSanat circle.

915
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:53,050
And I like, I didn't know who they were at first, but I looked them up.

916
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,470
Yes, we are the vibes team.

917
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,010
We might be the vibes team.

918
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:57,010
Um...

919
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:00,610
I mean, I can say what my team is right now.

920
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:03,450
And you'll understand why it's the vibes team.

921
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:12,750
Um, so, I have, my team is, uh, Guru, Gale, uh, Necros on support, apparently.

922
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:13,450
I...

923
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,750
I was like, why?

924
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:21,370
Cause like, I looked at my thing and I was like, why did they put Necros on support?

925
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:21,710
I...

926
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:22,510
I...

927
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,150
Yeah!

928
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:23,730
Yeah!

929
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:27,470
Like, I looked at the document and they were like, supports!

930
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:28,950
Doki and Necros.

931
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:30,050
And...

932
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:33,270
Um, because...

933
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:36,030
It's, YourRageGaming is the other DPS player.

934
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,370
It's YourRageGaming and...

935
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:40,950
Gale as the DPS player.

936
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:44,330
And then, Agent and Guru as the tanks.

937
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,990
And I thought it was really funny.

938
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:53,090
And the reason why I said this is gonna be a vibes team, is cause the enemy DPS player is Surefour and Shroud.

939
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:56,850
And then the enemy tanks are, uh, Bulger and Andrew.

940
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:58,150
And then I...

941
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:01,350
So I was like, good luck everyone.

942
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,430
I was like, good luck guys!

943
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,370
Good luck!

944
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:20,490
I hope, I hope they, I hope Bulger and Andrew treat Agent well.

945
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:24,050
And don't like, bully them too much.

946
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,110
So...

947
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:31,350
Cause like, I know Agent, Agent, um, doesn't play as much Marvel Rivals.

948
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:34,510
So I was like, okay, we're just gonna try our best.

949
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,330
We're gonna...

950
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,110
We're gonna try our best.

951
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:38,850
We're gonna vibe!

952
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:41,990
I know they're very vibey too.

953
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:43,090
I know...

954
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:44,530
Um...

955
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:49,290
I know they're, they're, they're like, a really vibey, vibey people.

956
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:50,030
Like, they're pretty funny.

957
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,550
Like, I looked a bit over the clips just to see like, who they are.

958
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:56,050
Cause I was like, I didn't know a lot of these people, uh, going in.

959
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,310
So I was just like, uh...

960
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:59,890
Uh, so I just like, looked them up.

961
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:01,070
And they seem like really funny people.

962
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,850
And they're like, part of the Kaisenak group too.

963
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,270
So, like, they know what they're doing.

964
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,450
Like, you know, like...

965
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:14,330
So, yeah, so, like, it's just... and I get to, like, you know, like, we get to see necros on support.

966
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:19,290
I don't know for how long because they're like, you guys can swap roles if you want.

967
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:24,130
But I thought it was really funny that, like, in the document, they're like, necros on support.

968
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,070
I was like, why?

969
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:31,590
I was like, wait, why?

970
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:34,530
They put Shroud and Shrefour on DPS.

971
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:35,710
Um,

972
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,670
Hat, thank you for the super chat.

973
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:41,630
Thank you, thank you.

974
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:44,430
Better bribe your homie Shrefour before the game starts.

975
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:45,210
Good luck, Doki.

976
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:46,590
Not that I'll help you.

977
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,630
Thank you for the super chat.

978
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:49,770
Thank you, thank you.

979
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:53,430
So, yeah, I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

980
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:54,330
It's gonna be really fun.

981
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:55,350
It's gonna be really fun.

982
00:40:55,970 --> 00:41:00,630
There's gonna be a long day tomorrow because I literally have a panel that ends at 2 at Fanime.

983
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:08,530
Um, obviously, it was really tight because, like, I didn't want to reject the offer because it was a huge opportunity in general for the Marvel Rivals stuff.

984
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:15,870
It was an incredibly big opportunity and it's obviously, like, you know, I didn't want to say no to that because I don't know when I'll get an offer like that again.

985
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:19,810
So, so I was just like, oh yeah, I can, I can fit that in.

986
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:23,150
Um, my event manager was like, that is very tight.

987
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,750
I was like, I can make it.

988
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:25,830
I can make it.

989
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:28,370
So, like, I really have a panel at 1 to 2.

990
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:33,290
And then right after the panel, I have to start my stream for Marvel Rivals.

991
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:38,130
And then right after this, I have an hour break and then I have a meet and greet right after.

992
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:40,910
So, it's gonna be a very busy day tomorrow.

993
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:45,570
And maybe I'll have my handyman there tomorrow to fix my fucking monitor too.

994
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:55,890
So, maybe if I'm lucky, my handyman will be here earlier before to fix my monitor as well.

995
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:58,470
Uh, but yes, anyway, those are all the updates.

996
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:04,070
Sorry, that was a very, uh, that was a very long day, long update session today.

997
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:06,070
But there was a lot of stuff I wanted to tell you guys.

998
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:12,810
So, um, it has been, uh, it's been a, I also, also, um, also.

999
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:20,490
So, my save on food groceries is gonna arrive at, I don't know what time, because I ordered the cheapest delivery.

1000
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:23,830
Which means it'll show up at any, it'll be a surprise.

1001
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:34,530
They're like, when you want, if you want it cheaper, you can do it, like, it'll come in delivery from 3 to 10 p.m.

1002
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:35,910
And I was like, you know what?

1003
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,310
Let's gotcha this.

1004
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:37,910
I don't know.

1005
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:43,010
It was, guys, you don't understand.

1006
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:45,150
It was four dollars cheaper.

1007
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:48,070
Four Canadian dollars cheaper.

1008
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:49,910
You don't understand.

1009
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:53,150
I need those four extra Canadian dollars.

1010
00:42:53,750 --> 00:43:00,010
So, I don't know when it's gonna arrive, but I'll receive a text message being like, we're almost there.

1011
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,550
So, like, it could arrive while I'm streaming.

1012
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:05,610
So, I, I, I don't know.

1013
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:13,790
Since the person that fucking bought two electric screwdrivers, because I just didn't know which one to get.

1014
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:22,550
I, but I, but God forbid I pay four more dollars to have a schedule delivery.

1015
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:24,210
That's too much.

1016
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:28,050
That's, that's my Oshi.

1017
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:32,430
Um, Michael, thank you for the super chat.

1018
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:33,450
Thank you, thank you.

1019
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:36,890
Hi, this is my first super to you, but I'm glad to hear you cheer yourself again.

1020
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:37,990
Thank you for the super chat.

1021
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:38,590
Thank you, thank you.

1022
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:39,810
I really appreciate the support.

1023
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:41,550
I hope you've been enjoying your time here.

1024
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:47,310
You know, I've just been rambling, uh, going on long tangents before even playing the game.

1025
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:49,010
But I hope you've been enjoying your time here.

1026
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:52,810
Alright, let me move this, my chat to my second monitor.

1027
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:59,170
And then this here, I have to rearrange everything just cause like, like I said.

1028
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:06,790
Um, it's actually, it's so weird trying to, um, have my chat on my second monitor.

1029
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:10,130
Cause I have so much, my second monitor is so crap with everything right now.

1030
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:11,910
So it's like, it's so messy.

1031
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:14,530
Alright, let's see.

1032
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:16,890
Here for delivery next time.

1033
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:18,490
My name, Ramona.

1034
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:20,170
Thank you for the super chat.

1035
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:21,570
Thank you, thank you.

1036
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:30,070
But yes, that means I might have to, I might disappear for a second to like, uh, to grab my groceries.

1037
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:32,790
That they'll leave outside my door.

1038
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:34,310
Oh my god.

1039
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:37,570
That's gonna be even con- actually convenient.

1040
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:39,490
Alright.

1041
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,190
Here we go.

1042
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:45,210
The Simpsons.

1043
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:46,690
Oh my god.

1044
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:49,310
They finally replaced Milhouse's voice actor.

1045
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:50,750
And it's so bad.

1046
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:51,770
I'm sad.

1047
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:55,650
I'm- I'm- I know like, you know, they're never gonna sound the same.

1048
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:59,290
But like, I watched the newest episodes of The Simpsons.

1049
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:04,570
And, uh, you know how like, the original Milhouse voice actor finally retired.

1050
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:09,310
And they finally- yeah, they casted the newest Milhouse voice actor.

1051
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:11,750
And she's so- she- I don't know.

1052
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:13,250
It's just- it's so weird.

1053
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:15,290
It's like- it's like super raspy.

1054
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:17,670
So like, you know how Milhouse's voice isn't raspy?

1055
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:22,430
But, the newest one is like- it's like- he talks like this.

1056
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:26,630
And I'm like- he's not that raspy!

1057
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:34,870
Like- yeah, I was like- he- yeah, it's like- why is this voice like that?

1058
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:37,010
Alright, hello, Apu.

1059
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:39,750
Apu, you've gotta help me warn Krusty about this alien plot.

1060
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:41,590
And thus save the good people of Springfield.

1061
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:43,530
I'm sorry sir, but I cannot speak English.

1062
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:44,670
I only speak Hindi.

1063
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:46,090
But you're speaking English now.

1064
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:47,970
Yes, I learned these words phonetically.

1065
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:50,830
Well, you're just scared of being vaporized by the space monsters.

1066
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:54,710
Up down, up down, go hot dog, butter my undershirt, blah blah blah.

1067
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:57,070
That's me.

1068
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:58,550
That's actually me.

1069
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:01,870
But like, if I- I didn't wanna- okay, so like...

1070
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:08,890
Um, when I used to live in Asia, or like, Hong Kong slash China.

1071
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:15,890
When I didn't wanna answer somebody, I'd be like, in English, sorry, I don't speak Chinese.

1072
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:21,230
I- Cause I was like, I don't know- I don't know.

1073
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:28,530
I would actually say that, cause I just- I didn't know what to do.

1074
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:30,730
I- I- you liar!

1075
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:30,970
Hi.

1076
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:33,710
Oh hey.

1077
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:34,630
Hey Barney.

1078
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:42,730
Hey Bar- I mean I, cause like people would approach me and I'd be like, sorry I don't speak Chinese, sorry...

1079
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:42,950
Sorry.

1080
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:48,690
I don't know.

1081
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:50,610
I just... I didn't want to do it.

1082
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:52,470
I just... I don't know what they would ask me.

1083
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:54,950
I just didn't want to... I was like, I don't know.

1084
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:58,470
Please don't interact with me.

1085
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:02,590
That's a new level of anti-social.

1086
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:06,870
No speak English.

1087
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:08,730
No speak English.

1088
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:09,550
Sorry.

1089
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:14,130
No, I can't do that.

1090
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:15,970
I used to wear headphones instead.

1091
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:19,830
If I'm in a country where people speak English.

1092
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:23,330
I gotta round up these other little dudes and get them to Krustyloo for the studio tour.

1093
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:24,390
That's where I need to go.

1094
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:25,330
Step on it, Otto.

1095
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:26,110
Okay.

1096
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:29,150
Right after I drop these kids off at Krustyloo.

1097
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:30,890
Otto, I just said that.

1098
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:31,390
Alright.

1099
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:34,870
Stop hassling me, midget Abraham Lincoln.

1100
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:37,890
Alright.

1101
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:39,130
Going to the loo.

1102
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:43,590
Collect all the kids and go to Krustyloo Studios before Krusty leaves.

1103
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:45,270
I don't remember how to drive.

1104
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:46,810
Oh, no.

1105
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:47,910
It's been so long.

1106
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:48,210
Okay.

1107
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:48,930
Wait, actually.

1108
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:50,210
No, I got this.

1109
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,350
Oh, it's not that bad.

1110
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:55,210
Instead of running over children, I'm picking them up.

1111
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:57,210
Alright.

1112
00:47:58,750 --> 00:47:59,270
Alright.

1113
00:47:59,270 --> 00:47:59,370
Alright.

1114
00:47:59,370 --> 00:47:59,690
Nice.

1115
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:01,050
We got one more kid.

1116
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:03,050
Oh, shit.

1117
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:03,870
How do I turn?

1118
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:06,030
Oh, no.

1119
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:07,730
How do I turn?

1120
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:09,890
How do I turn efficiently?

1121
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:12,050
Oh, this is not good.

1122
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:14,010
I actually don't remember.

1123
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:16,530
Oh, no.

1124
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:18,730
How do I turn efficiently?

1125
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:22,090
I don't remember how to drift.

1126
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:23,610
Okay.

1127
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:24,470
Here we go.

1128
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:25,650
Oh, it's here.

1129
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:27,210
Oh, my God.

1130
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:28,950
Do you think I can cheat on this one, too?

1131
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:31,130
Okay.

1132
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:32,050
Oh, no.

1133
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:33,990
Oh, I was not paying attention.

1134
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:35,170
Oh, it's okay.

1135
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:36,510
It's okay.

1136
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:37,190
I have this.

1137
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:42,470
Did I make it?

1138
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:42,990
Oh, my God.

1139
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:43,470
I made it.

1140
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:43,990
Oh, my God.

1141
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:44,810
No driver's license.

1142
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:46,490
Okay.

1143
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:47,510
Nice.

1144
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:49,790
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1145
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:50,170
It's okay.

1146
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:50,990
They can't drive.

1147
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:53,570
They don't know how to drive just like me.

1148
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:57,350
Oh, that means I can run over as many children as I want.

1149
00:48:58,570 --> 00:48:59,950
There's no consequences.

1150
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:01,790
The cops are already after me anyway.

1151
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:03,010
Alright.

1152
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:03,570
13.

1153
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:04,830
14.

1154
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:06,830
15.

1155
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:07,390
Okay.

1156
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:07,730
Nice.

1157
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:08,870
Oh, and then they disappear.

1158
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:12,350
Oh, I forgot about the Krusty Studios part.

1159
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:15,590
Okay.

1160
00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:17,190
Oh, my God.

1161
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:18,390
Wait, how far is it?

1162
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:20,050
Wait.

1163
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:21,590
How far is Krusty Studio?

1164
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:22,570
Oh, no.

1165
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:23,150
Please.

1166
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:23,930
Is it right there?

1167
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:24,750
Oh, it's right there.

1168
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:25,210
It's right there.

1169
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:25,950
Oh, thank God.

1170
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:26,550
It's right there.

1171
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:33,830
Let me get my earphones for a bit.

1172
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:35,430
I made it.

1173
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:35,910
Yay.

1174
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:38,830
No consequences.

1175
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:43,110
I need to do a lot of collateral damage in the minimum amount of time.

1176
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:44,410
I've got just the thing.

1177
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:45,170
Wait, what kind of car?

1178
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:48,190
I bought a car that was owned by a super villain.

1179
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:50,670
He used it to conquer the East Coast.

1180
00:49:51,110 --> 00:49:51,510
Ooh.

1181
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:57,390
Lopex super villain car.

1182
00:49:58,010 --> 00:49:59,830
Wait, I actually don't know this reference.

1183
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:01,830
It's 600 coins?

1184
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:04,090
Wait, is this Hank Scorpio?

1185
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:06,270
Oh, it's Hank Scorpio's car?

1186
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:07,510
Oh, my God.

1187
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:09,050
I miss Hank Scorpio.

1188
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:10,330
I don't know how he's doing.

1189
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:13,410
I didn't...

1190
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:15,050
Oh, that's his car.

1191
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:17,290
I didn't know that was the name of the car.

1192
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,990
I didn't remember what the car looked like.

1193
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:22,830
I think he's a really nice guy.

1194
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:23,970
He has...

1195
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:31,110
All I'm saying is that he can't be that bad if he provides insurance and, like, dental for his workers.

1196
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:32,290
Barney, where's Krusty?

1197
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:33,450
I have to warn him.

1198
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:35,110
Krusty's not here, little Homer.

1199
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:36,870
He's down at the Squidport.

1200
00:50:36,970 --> 00:50:37,590
Little Homer?

1201
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:39,470
Doing a promo for this new Buzz Cola.

1202
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:42,990
But that's the cola the aliens are using to control all human behavior.

1203
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:44,630
Control human behavior?

1204
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:46,710
No beverage could do that.

1205
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:47,750
Oh, no.

1206
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:49,630
I haven't had a duff in two hours.

1207
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:50,930
My life is over!

1208
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:56,050
But I have to get to Krusty before the limo does.

1209
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:57,230
And I have to stay here.

1210
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:58,150
Guys, I'm not going to mute myself.

1211
00:50:58,170 --> 00:50:58,990
I'm going to blow my nose.

1212
00:50:59,290 --> 00:50:59,690
Sounds like a plan.

1213
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,810
Because I can't alt-tab and fix my volume.

1214
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,320
We got the rare blowing nose.

1215
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,060
Find Krusty's limo to find Krusty.

1216
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,620
Talk to Krusty before his limo picks up.

1217
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:14,080
Okay.

1218
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:16,440
Follow the movie truck?

1219
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,400
Wait, where's my car?

1220
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:20,040
Wait!

1221
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:21,100
Wait!

1222
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,980
I was trying to find my car!

1223
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,680
Wait, where is he?

1224
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:26,540
Alright.

1225
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,480
I was like trying to figure out where my car was.

1226
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:30,760
And he just drove away.

1227
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:32,820
Okay.

1228
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:33,540
That's fine.

1229
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:34,860
That's fine.

1230
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:35,600
I can make it.

1231
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,520
That's fine.

1232
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,220
Oh my god.

1233
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:41,980
That's okay.

1234
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,000
That's okay.

1235
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:43,820
He's still turning.

1236
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,460
It's not that bad.

1237
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:50,220
Oh my god.

1238
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,840
It's not fair!

1239
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,420
I didn't know where my car was!

1240
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,960
Dude, where's my car?

1241
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:58,260
Alright.

1242
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:58,840
This time.

1243
00:51:58,940 --> 00:51:59,280
This time.

1244
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,520
Now that I know where my...

1245
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,960
I drove the wrong way.

1246
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:06,770
Okay.

1247
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:07,390
Alright.

1248
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:09,470
This time.

1249
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:10,770
This time.

1250
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:11,210
This time.

1251
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:11,310
This time.

1252
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:12,650
Now I know where I'm going.

1253
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:13,550
Now...

1254
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:16,130
Now I know where I'm going for real.

1255
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:18,410
I lost track.

1256
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:22,570
I got lost.

1257
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:23,410
I don't know how.

1258
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:24,650
It was literally...

1259
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:27,010
It was a 50-50 and I somehow got lost.

1260
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:28,530
But it's okay.

1261
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:29,830
Everything is okay now.

1262
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:31,490
Okay.

1263
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:32,490
We just gotta follow him.

1264
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,370
But that's...

1265
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:34,850
Okay.

1266
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:35,710
We gotta figure out...

1267
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:36,850
Find out where Krusty is.

1268
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:38,550
Okay.

1269
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:41,410
Alright.

1270
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:42,390
Yeah.

1271
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:44,630
It's pretty relaxing.

1272
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:47,410
This is a pretty fast car.

1273
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:50,050
Yeah.

1274
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:51,450
Hello.

1275
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:52,470
Easy peasy.

1276
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:53,230
Race.

1277
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:53,530
Oh.

1278
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:54,310
At the race?

1279
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:57,310
He like just waited for me.

1280
00:52:57,410 --> 00:52:58,650
So I waited for him too.

1281
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:00,230
I thought he was being nice.

1282
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:01,910
Oh no.

1283
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:02,590
Oh no.

1284
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:03,630
Oh no.

1285
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:04,530
No.

1286
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:05,610
Mr. Burns.

1287
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:08,150
An illegal casino.

1288
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:09,750
Okay.

1289
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:12,430
Oh no.

1290
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:14,370
There must be a shortcut somewhere.

1291
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:18,470
There must be...

1292
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:19,430
This has to be a shortcut.

1293
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:20,670
Okay.

1294
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:20,850
No.

1295
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:21,670
I went the long way.

1296
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:23,150
Where he went was the shortcut.

1297
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:24,690
Are you fucking kidding me?

1298
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:26,910
Okay.

1299
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:27,770
That's the shortcut.

1300
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:29,090
Okay.

1301
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:29,570
I'm fine.

1302
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:30,250
Okay.

1303
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:31,010
I'm not fine.

1304
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:33,010
Oh no.

1305
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:35,090
Where is he going?

1306
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:38,030
Okay.

1307
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:38,310
It's okay.

1308
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:39,050
I have another shortcut.

1309
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:40,130
Okay.

1310
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,290
He's all the way...

1311
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:43,810
He's all the way down there already.

1312
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:45,390
Oh my god.

1313
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:48,670
I doubt that he did not get...

1314
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:50,670
How did he not hit any of the NPCs?

1315
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:54,510
That doesn't make sense.

1316
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:54,830
Okay.

1317
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:56,090
I know where he's going this time.

1318
00:53:56,290 --> 00:53:57,770
So I can drive past him.

1319
00:53:59,130 --> 00:53:59,530
Okay.

1320
00:53:59,690 --> 00:53:59,990
Oh god.

1321
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:00,710
I hate this car.

1322
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:01,890
I hate this car.

1323
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:01,910
I hate this car.

1324
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:03,050
I hate this.

1325
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:06,070
Okay.

1326
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:07,790
I know where this car is going.

1327
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:09,290
So I can technically drive ahead.

1328
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:11,970
Get me out of here.

1329
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:13,050
Are you fucking...

1330
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:13,990
Okay.

1331
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:14,770
Get me out of here.

1332
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:16,630
Alright.

1333
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:18,670
Are you...

1334
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:18,790
Okay.

1335
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:19,370
It's fine.

1336
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:19,810
It's fine.

1337
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:20,830
Everything is fine.

1338
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:24,790
They're clearly driving on the wrong side of the road.

1339
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:25,270
Not me.

1340
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:26,810
I know where I'm going.

1341
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:29,770
It's their fault.

1342
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:31,130
Not my fault that they drive.

1343
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:32,030
Are you...

1344
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:32,870
Oh my god.

1345
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:33,850
I'm spinning.

1346
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:37,750
I'm in the car.

1347
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:39,550
I'm in the car.

1348
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:41,230
I'm in the car.

1349
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:42,830
My rims cost $900.

1350
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:43,570
Oh no.

1351
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:44,270
Oh no.

1352
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:45,610
My car might actually...

1353
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:46,610
Oh no.

1354
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:49,890
Why doesn't it hit his car?

1355
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:52,830
Why does it all hit my car?

1356
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:56,170
My money!

1357
00:54:58,890 --> 00:54:59,770
Okay.

1358
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:01,510
Um...

1359
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:04,790
I don't think I'm gonna make it, guys.

1360
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:10,950
Okay, we're gonna grab someone else's car.

1361
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:13,370
Okay, that is four stars.

1362
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:15,070
Oh, wait.

1363
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:16,810
Maybe this one.

1364
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:19,110
This might be a better car.

1365
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:22,070
Wait, where's my car?

1366
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:25,370
Wait, where is it?

1367
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:28,050
I called for it.

1368
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:29,730
Oh, there it is.

1369
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:31,630
Okay.

1370
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:34,130
I believe in myself.

1371
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:39,070
Okay, there we go.

1372
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:39,570
There we go.

1373
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:40,330
This is gonna be fine.

1374
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:41,450
I've got the best car.

1375
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:43,670
It'll be fine.

1376
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:46,490
Literally the best car for this.

1377
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:49,490
Um, okay.

1378
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:55,090
How did I get worse?

1379
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:56,630
Oh my god!

1380
00:55:57,470 --> 00:55:57,850
Okay.

1381
00:55:57,850 --> 00:55:58,710
Okay, it's fine.

1382
00:55:58,870 --> 00:55:59,350
It's fine.

1383
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:00,190
We're okay.

1384
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:03,090
Okay, we're okay.

1385
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:04,410
I can get back into this.

1386
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:06,590
It might have been a while since we played.

1387
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:08,170
But like, I got this, guys.

1388
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:11,770
I could do it.

1389
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,030
No, no, no.

1390
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:15,490
It's not a driver's issue.

1391
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:17,550
It was a car issue this entire...

1392
00:56:20,930 --> 00:56:23,430
Did you get the license plate?

1393
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:23,890
Did anyone get the license plate?

1394
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:25,050
Oh yeah baby, but...

1395
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:26,750
Did anyone get the license plate?

1396
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:28,750
What the fuck was that bullshit?

1397
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:32,070
He... he drove into me!

1398
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:33,690
He... he...

1399
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:36,330
This was sabotage right from the beginning.

1400
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:38,730
This was actual sabotage.

1401
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:42,110
Oh my god.

1402
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:47,290
I refuse to believe he didn't intentionally sabotage me.

1403
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:52,470
Are you serious?

1404
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:55,010
I'm stuck between the legs!

1405
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:56,290
No!

1406
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:04,530
Why would you put a wrench in?

1407
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:05,490
I can't get through!

1408
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:09,110
Oh my god.

1409
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:11,330
This is too cool in school.

1410
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:11,630
Yeah.

1411
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:11,850
Garden, I should let them run in for pizza.

1412
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:12,810
That's not fair!

1413
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:16,950
Why would you put a wrench there if I can't...

1414
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:17,890
Wait a pa.

1415
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:30,410
Cards stop.

1416
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:38,990
So I assume you can go through.

1417
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:42,650
This is the game's fault.

1418
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:43,930
This is not my fault.

1419
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:46,130
This is actually not my fault.

1420
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:48,270
This is actually the game's fault.

1421
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:52,270
Why would you put a wrench there if you can't get past it?

1422
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:54,550
That makes no sense.

1423
00:57:56,550 --> 00:58:00,370
That actually makes no fucking sense.

1424
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:07,050
Like, there's a hole, so clearly I should be able to go in it.

1425
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:08,830
That's what holes are for.

1426
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:12,930
All right, here we go.

1427
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:14,850
Here we go.

1428
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:17,030
Oh my god.

1429
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:19,070
Oh, I completed the task.

1430
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:20,410
I was so far away.

1431
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:23,790
You could if you turned right.

1432
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:25,250
That's not my fault.

1433
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:26,830
Wait.

1434
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,550
Wait, are you fucking kidding me?

1435
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:31,870
Are you?

1436
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:32,330
Okay.

1437
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:35,910
Okay, that's actually... I'm so sad.

1438
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:41,890
I swear to god, if he...

1439
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:42,510
Start.

1440
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:44,770
Start.

1441
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:46,950
Start.

1442
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:49,370
Eat my dust, Dusty.

1443
00:58:49,370 --> 00:58:49,830
Start.

1444
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:52,390
Is he stupid?

1445
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:53,510
Start.

1446
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:55,810
It's time for some road rage.

1447
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:57,450
Bart Simpson style.

1448
00:58:57,690 --> 00:58:58,310
Wait, that's a cop.

1449
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:00,310
Eat asphalt, asphalt.

1450
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:01,110
Why won't you...

1451
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:02,510
Oh my god!

1452
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:04,650
Oh my god!

1453
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:05,590
Oh my god!

1454
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:06,710
Oh my god!

1455
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:07,830
What did he do to me?

1456
00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:09,050
What...

1457
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:12,090
What the fuck?

1458
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:14,030
Oh my god!

1459
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:32,520
What was that?

1460
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:42,930
Space Ace, thank you for the super chat.

1461
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:43,490
Thank you.

1462
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:44,130
Thank you.

1463
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:47,050
The game is out to get you.

1464
00:59:48,490 --> 00:59:50,590
What did he...

1465
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:50,650
What?

1466
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:51,690
How?

1467
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:54,230
How?

1468
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:54,950
How did he...

1469
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:56,830
How did he destroy...

1470
00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:01,470
Bro fucking touched my car and it died.

1471
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:06,510
I didn't even hit that many people.

1472
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:12,150
That was an earth shattering kaboom.

1473
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:15,590
I was like, oh, that's a cop.

1474
01:00:15,870 --> 01:00:17,250
And then he took it personal.

1475
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:21,170
I was just saying what I saw.

1476
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:27,170
He was charging up his ultimate right there.

1477
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:29,310
That shit was crazy.

1478
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:31,550
Oh shit.

1479
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:35,870
Yeah, he like one shot me.

1480
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:37,430
I wasn't expecting it.

1481
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:39,490
Alright.

1482
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:41,690
Hello.

1483
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:44,170
Alright, nice.

1484
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:45,430
Okay.

1485
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:48,950
Okay, but what if his car explodes?

1486
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:52,830
If his car explodes, does it count as me winning?

1487
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:54,770
Oh my god.

1488
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:56,350
Oh my god.

1489
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:57,050
Okay, that's fine.

1490
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:57,390
That's fine.

1491
01:00:57,510 --> 01:00:57,990
We're all fine.

1492
01:00:58,570 --> 01:00:59,650
We're all fine.

1493
01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:01,650
Oh, we're all fine.

1494
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:03,790
Okay.

1495
01:01:04,510 --> 01:01:05,330
I just don't have...

1496
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:06,730
I just should not go through the hole.

1497
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:08,670
The hole is not the goal.

1498
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:11,190
Do not go through the hole, Doki.

1499
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:13,270
Hole is not the goal.

1500
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:16,830
For once in your life, don't go through holes.

1501
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:18,030
I know.

1502
01:01:18,270 --> 01:01:19,110
It's tempting.

1503
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:21,930
Oh my god.

1504
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:24,390
Oh my god.

1505
01:01:25,990 --> 01:01:26,550
Oh!

1506
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:33,880
Oh, what the fuck happened to me?

1507
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:37,700
Actually, what happened to me?

1508
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,100
Are you serious?

1509
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:42,020
Are you serious?

1510
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:52,780
Jimbo...

1511
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:56,640
Jimbo fucking touched my car and then...

1512
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,740
I don't know if you saw that.

1513
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,800
I saw Jimbo in front of me.

1514
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,320
He touched my car and then I started drifting.

1515
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,660
Like, my car started, like, spinning out.

1516
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:08,560
I don't know what the fuck he did.

1517
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:09,440
He...

1518
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,920
I don't know what he did.

1519
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:13,620
It was crazy.

1520
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:14,920
It was...

1521
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:39,420
It was...

1522
01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:42,170
Boom.

1523
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:43,030
Boom.

1524
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:44,810
Jesus Christ.

1525
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:46,590
This is actually such a hard race.

1526
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:48,250
This race is actually...

1527
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:49,650
I understand now.

1528
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:50,670
I...

1529
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:51,890
I...

1530
01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:52,970
I understand now.

1531
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:55,370
When you said the difficulty...

1532
01:02:55,370 --> 01:02:56,090
Jumps.

1533
01:02:56,890 --> 01:02:57,730
Like...

1534
01:02:57,730 --> 01:02:58,050
I...

1535
01:02:58,050 --> 01:02:59,750
Oh my god.

1536
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:02,650
Like, how is he such a good driver?

1537
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:07,130
Oh my god.

1538
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:09,630
Oh nice.

1539
01:03:10,330 --> 01:03:10,910
Oh nice.

1540
01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:14,690
Like, I'm going through all the shortcuts...

1541
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:15,770
And he's still...

1542
01:03:15,770 --> 01:03:17,350
Overtaking me.

1543
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:22,170
Like, how is he doing that?

1544
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:25,330
Okay.

1545
01:03:26,990 --> 01:03:28,010
Oh my god.

1546
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:28,970
Oh my god.

1547
01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:30,010
Please.

1548
01:03:30,370 --> 01:03:30,930
This is it.

1549
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:32,250
Please make it through.

1550
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:35,730
Oh my god.

1551
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:36,290
Thank god.

1552
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:37,350
Thank god.

1553
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:42,010
Oh there's Krusty.

1554
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:43,810
There's Krusty.

1555
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:46,770
Hello.

1556
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:49,870
I got physics hard.

1557
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:51,250
Oh well that makes you go crazy.

1558
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:52,290
It'll be a massacre.

1559
01:03:52,510 --> 01:03:54,910
The streets will be littered with lasered off limbs and heads.

1560
01:03:55,210 --> 01:03:55,930
Yeah, right.

1561
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:58,870
And I'm getting into the Country Western Hall of Fame.

1562
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:00,790
It just ain't gonna happen, kid.

1563
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:01,390
Oh.

1564
01:04:01,930 --> 01:04:03,390
I just gotta find evidence.

1565
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:06,670
Who do I know that's smart enough to prove this alien conspiracy?

1566
01:04:06,970 --> 01:04:07,350
Lisa!

1567
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:07,930
A movie man?

1568
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:08,970
Comic book guy?

1569
01:04:09,390 --> 01:04:10,170
Disco stool?

1570
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:11,490
That's it.

1571
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:12,150
A nerd!

1572
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:13,290
Professor Frank!

1573
01:04:13,470 --> 01:04:14,190
Oh wait.

1574
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:14,450
Yeah.

1575
01:04:14,610 --> 01:04:14,910
I forgot.

1576
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:16,330
The actual scientist.

1577
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:17,130
Not child.

1578
01:04:17,410 --> 01:04:17,950
I forgot.

1579
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:21,250
The child is not the smartest person.

1580
01:04:22,810 --> 01:04:24,210
Evie, thank you for the super chat.

1581
01:04:24,330 --> 01:04:24,550
Thank you.

1582
01:04:24,670 --> 01:04:25,150
Thank you.

1583
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:28,130
I'm sure from your position, this all seems quite unfortunate.

1584
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:31,990
But truth is, the game was rigged from the start.

1585
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:34,070
I have to follow Professor.

1586
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:35,150
Oh my god.

1587
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:35,830
I just...

1588
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:36,830
I just got here.

1589
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:37,830
I...

1590
01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:39,750
I just...

1591
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:40,550
Please.

1592
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:44,870
I had no time to pause.

1593
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:48,350
Okay.

1594
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:48,910
Don't worry.

1595
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:50,630
I'm heading over.

1596
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:52,450
That was totally awesome.

1597
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:52,690
Okay.

1598
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:54,310
We just gotta follow Professor Frank.

1599
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:57,330
I literally was like, all right.

1600
01:04:57,850 --> 01:05:00,110
I'll get to have like a little bit of a break, right?

1601
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:00,790
Nope.

1602
01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:02,750
Time to follow Professor.

1603
01:05:02,910 --> 01:05:03,090
Wait.

1604
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:03,850
He's going back.

1605
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:04,790
What?

1606
01:05:04,790 --> 01:05:07,110
Where are you going, Professor?

1607
01:05:08,350 --> 01:05:08,830
Wait.

1608
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:09,650
He's just going...

1609
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:10,910
He's just going back.

1610
01:05:12,190 --> 01:05:13,850
He's just loop-de-loop-ing.

1611
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:15,590
He's playing with me.

1612
01:05:17,370 --> 01:05:18,650
Oh my god.

1613
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:18,990
No.

1614
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:20,030
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1615
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:21,590
It's okay.

1616
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:24,470
It's okay.

1617
01:05:25,790 --> 01:05:26,570
It's okay.

1618
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:27,110
No.

1619
01:05:27,350 --> 01:05:27,730
No.

1620
01:05:27,950 --> 01:05:28,450
No.

1621
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:30,390
Oh, it's okay.

1622
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:31,070
It's okay.

1623
01:05:31,950 --> 01:05:33,850
That was totally awesome.

1624
01:05:33,890 --> 01:05:34,310
It's okay.

1625
01:05:35,830 --> 01:05:36,810
Oh my god.

1626
01:05:36,830 --> 01:05:37,450
Where is he going?

1627
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:38,930
Oh my god.

1628
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:39,370
I...

1629
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:41,370
Please, Professor, where are you going?

1630
01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:43,530
I have cops!

1631
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:44,110
Sorry!

1632
01:05:44,810 --> 01:05:45,110
No!

1633
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:49,390
Eat my dust, dust eaters.

1634
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:51,230
Bunch of...

1635
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:54,730
I can't believe it.

1636
01:05:55,810 --> 01:05:56,430
Professor.

1637
01:05:57,410 --> 01:05:59,590
Where were you going?

1638
01:06:00,710 --> 01:06:01,450
Where?

1639
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:02,330
Where?

1640
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:02,630
Where?

1641
01:06:02,970 --> 01:06:04,010
Where are you going?

1642
01:06:04,010 --> 01:06:04,670
Where are you going?

1643
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:07,490
You just didn't loop the looping!

1644
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:13,750
Okay, now that I know he loops that area, now that I know he's fucking with me.

1645
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:17,450
F4, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1646
01:06:17,570 --> 01:06:20,530
He's just there the fuck with me.

1647
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:23,350
Now that I know, I wait.

1648
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:25,770
I wait.

1649
01:06:28,910 --> 01:06:29,870
That's right.

1650
01:06:30,430 --> 01:06:32,050
I know your games.

1651
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:33,870
I played these games before.

1652
01:06:34,830 --> 01:06:36,750
I know your games.

1653
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:40,190
You just gonna loop the loop.

1654
01:06:42,190 --> 01:06:42,990
That's right.

1655
01:06:45,330 --> 01:06:47,290
Okay, he's gonna loop the loop here too.

1656
01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:50,030
So I just gotta like, wait.

1657
01:06:51,310 --> 01:06:53,250
All I have to do is wait.

1658
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:54,790
Wait, he's going through that shortcut.

1659
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:55,630
What the freak?

1660
01:06:56,650 --> 01:06:58,410
This is reserved for the main character.

1661
01:06:58,610 --> 01:07:00,090
Okay, he's just gonna loop the loop here.

1662
01:07:00,490 --> 01:07:02,670
And then I don't know where he's gonna go after that.

1663
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:06,150
Okay, he's going back downstairs.

1664
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:06,770
Where?

1665
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:08,090
Okay, there we go.

1666
01:07:08,970 --> 01:07:10,530
And then I'll wait for him.

1667
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:15,190
Okay, where else is he going to?

1668
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:18,010
Professor Frank, what are you doing?

1669
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:19,510
I don't know.

1670
01:07:19,770 --> 01:07:22,750
Like, I'm not smart enough to comprehend his mind.

1671
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:24,110
Hey, watch it.

1672
01:07:24,770 --> 01:07:26,350
Like, is he's looping again?

1673
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:29,430
It's just gonna loop forever?

1674
01:07:31,390 --> 01:07:33,530
Okay, go this way.

1675
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:34,210
Oh, nice.

1676
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:34,710
He's stuck.

1677
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:37,650
Yes, make your own opening.

1678
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:39,170
Wait, but wait for me.

1679
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:40,590
Wait for me.

1680
01:07:40,910 --> 01:07:41,950
Wait, Professor.

1681
01:07:45,090 --> 01:07:45,910
Professor, wait.

1682
01:07:48,850 --> 01:07:50,530
Wait, are you gonna loop again?

1683
01:07:50,970 --> 01:07:51,530
I can't.

1684
01:07:51,630 --> 01:07:52,610
No, he's not looping.

1685
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,190
Oh my god, I fucked up.

1686
01:07:54,450 --> 01:07:55,650
I thought he was gonna loop.

1687
01:07:58,330 --> 01:07:59,370
I fucked up.

1688
01:07:59,690 --> 01:08:01,730
I was legitimately waiting for him to loop.

1689
01:08:03,870 --> 01:08:05,170
Oh my god, where is he going?

1690
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:07,990
Okay.

1691
01:08:07,990 --> 01:08:08,710
Oh, nice.

1692
01:08:09,490 --> 01:08:11,030
Okay, I don't know where he's going now.

1693
01:08:11,770 --> 01:08:13,110
Professor, where are you going?

1694
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:14,190
Oh, nice.

1695
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:14,550
Okay.

1696
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:17,470
Oh, thank god.

1697
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:19,310
Oh, he's going back to his lab.

1698
01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:20,850
That makes sense.

1699
01:08:23,530 --> 01:08:25,250
Oh, we did it.

1700
01:08:26,610 --> 01:08:27,870
We fucking did it.

1701
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:30,010
Professor Frank, you've got to help me.

1702
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:31,450
No one believes my story.

1703
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:36,090
It's just like the boy who cried wolf, except instead of a wolf, it's an alien conspiracy.

1704
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:37,030
Aliens?

1705
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:41,910
Well, that would explain these strange transmissions from my plutonium CB radio.

1706
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:44,670
I must have intercepted an alien message.

1707
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:47,950
It says they're hiding the lasers in the duff trucks.

1708
01:08:48,490 --> 01:08:51,390
Le Hive and Glivey, the plot is convoluted now.

1709
01:08:52,570 --> 01:08:54,570
That's my Simpsons episode.

1710
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:57,290
Oh, shit.

1711
01:08:57,570 --> 01:08:58,730
Okay, we're gonna stop the...

1712
01:08:58,730 --> 01:08:59,930
We're gonna get into your...

1713
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:00,690
Okay, we're gonna...

1714
01:09:00,690 --> 01:09:01,990
Wait, I want to teleport this monkey.

1715
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:03,990
Is he gonna become a monkey fly?

1716
01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:07,810
See, nothing bad happened to the monkey.

1717
01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:09,170
The monkey's fine.

1718
01:09:10,330 --> 01:09:12,010
Then we teleport him back.

1719
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:14,190
And the monkey's fine.

1720
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:15,750
And then we teleport him back.

1721
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:17,970
Monkey, go back.

1722
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:20,710
Monkey, go back.

1723
01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:22,790
Yes, monkey.

1724
01:09:23,110 --> 01:09:23,930
Keep teleport...

1725
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:24,190
Oh!

1726
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:30,810
Oh no, the monkey's okay.

1727
01:09:30,930 --> 01:09:31,930
The monkey's okay, guys.

1728
01:09:32,230 --> 01:09:33,610
The monkey's okay, everybody.

1729
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:36,310
I'm like, guys, the monkey's okay.

1730
01:09:36,350 --> 01:09:37,930
It's not inhumane.

1731
01:09:38,730 --> 01:09:39,410
Alright, let's...

1732
01:09:39,410 --> 01:09:41,890
Let's cancel this mission.

1733
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:44,370
So then I can...

1734
01:09:44,370 --> 01:09:46,790
So I can, like, save my game because I'm scared.

1735
01:09:50,170 --> 01:09:51,090
Alright, save.

1736
01:09:51,450 --> 01:09:51,690
Alright, save.

1737
01:09:51,690 --> 01:09:52,690
Yes, also I want to buy clothes.

1738
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:56,810
Oh, look cool.

1739
01:09:58,970 --> 01:09:59,390
It's...

1740
01:09:59,390 --> 01:09:59,950
Exactly.

1741
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:01,410
It's ethical and no...

1742
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:02,490
Oh my god, it's hero.

1743
01:10:04,490 --> 01:10:05,670
Oh, I want...

1744
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:06,050
Actually...

1745
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:09,090
I don't know.

1746
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:10,390
I mean, Bartman's cool.

1747
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:17,570
The good twin.

1748
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:20,710
I don't know if I want to farm $600, guys.

1749
01:10:22,770 --> 01:10:24,170
I could be the good twin.

1750
01:10:29,470 --> 01:10:30,190
Oh, wait.

1751
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:31,410
Wait, can I farm it?

1752
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:32,170
Maybe.

1753
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:32,910
Wait.

1754
01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:36,650
Alright, let's see how much this gives me first.

1755
01:10:39,330 --> 01:10:40,210
Okay, $348.

1756
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:42,290
Do I want to farm it?

1757
01:10:42,390 --> 01:10:43,190
That's the question.

1758
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:46,330
Am I strong enough to farm it?

1759
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:50,570
$600 is easy to get?

1760
01:10:50,710 --> 01:10:51,370
Do I want them?

1761
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:51,790
Alright.

1762
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:54,290
Alright, let's try and get Bartman.

1763
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:56,610
Alright, let's see.

1764
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:00,190
Let's see.

1765
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:01,290
Where can I get money?

1766
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:04,610
So I can exchange it for goods and services.

1767
01:11:07,390 --> 01:11:07,950
Alright.

1768
01:11:08,350 --> 01:11:09,110
Oh, the telescope?

1769
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:12,430
Does the telescope get me money?

1770
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:14,870
No.

1771
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:17,130
No, I just went through the most stressful race.

1772
01:11:17,470 --> 01:11:19,310
I can't do that again.

1773
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:19,870
Alright.

1774
01:11:20,450 --> 01:11:25,450
I literally went through a very stressful race right now.

1775
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:30,240
Oh.

1776
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:34,020
Oh, there's the alien.

1777
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:35,360
I'm going to blow my nose.

1778
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:36,700
I'm sorry, guys.

1779
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:37,420
I can't mute.

1780
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:43,120
Wait, that's it?

1781
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:44,820
That wasn't a cool.

1782
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:46,000
That wasn't that cool.

1783
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:50,620
Sorry, I have to blow my nose, guys.

1784
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:54,840
Normally, I would mute, but I'm scared of alt-tabbing in the Simpsons game.

1785
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,840
The dock has a lot of money?

1786
01:11:57,940 --> 01:11:59,400
Okay, I'm going to go backwards.

1787
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:01,940
This is where the dock is, right?

1788
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:03,400
I don't know.

1789
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:04,380
I already...

1790
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:07,020
I lost track of where I am.

1791
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:09,000
Oh, wait.

1792
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:09,680
This has money.

1793
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:10,080
I remember.

1794
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:10,820
The yield.

1795
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:12,240
Off-ramp.

1796
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:13,220
In.

1797
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:15,840
I'll destroy this for like, two dollars.

1798
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:17,520
Nice.

1799
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:20,340
Alright, let's destroy this too.

1800
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:22,180
Alright.

1801
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,860
Money, money, money.

1802
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,240
How much be funny.

1803
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:30,180
In a witch man's world.

1804
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:31,640
Buy a bomb.

1805
01:12:37,030 --> 01:12:39,190
Alright, let's go grab all these coins.

1806
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:41,390
You know what game I really want to play?

1807
01:12:41,610 --> 01:12:43,570
I want to play that Futurama game.

1808
01:12:44,070 --> 01:12:47,690
Um, where apparently it's like a hidden episode of Futurama.

1809
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:49,970
That's like integral to the plot or some shit.

1810
01:12:50,650 --> 01:12:52,490
I've never played that game before.

1811
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:54,630
I heard it's really, really good.

1812
01:12:58,790 --> 01:13:01,090
Someone said like, ask me, uh, Thomas.

1813
01:13:01,330 --> 01:13:03,290
Oh yeah, uh, uh, uh, thank you for the super chat.

1814
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:03,950
Thank you, thank you.

1815
01:13:03,990 --> 01:13:09,370
Have I ever played, I, is that the one where he goes, where, um, the Simpsons go to heaven?

1816
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:13,330
And to find out that God was actually the secret writer?

1817
01:13:13,710 --> 01:13:17,650
Like, um, God, uh, made the Simpsons game?

1818
01:13:17,870 --> 01:13:18,450
Is that it?

1819
01:13:18,530 --> 01:13:19,850
Sorry if it's spoiler alert.

1820
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:25,050
Was that, yeah?

1821
01:13:25,370 --> 01:13:28,190
I don't know, cause I played that game from start to finish.

1822
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:31,110
So like, I don't know if I want to play it on stream.

1823
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:33,730
Because I know, like, how it goes.

1824
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:36,010
Just cause like, I grew up with that game too.

1825
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:39,410
The reason why, wait, wait, that's the Duff Balloon!

1826
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:41,510
I want to go to the Duff Balloon!

1827
01:13:50,390 --> 01:13:56,690
I want to go to the Duff Balloon!

1828
01:13:56,690 --> 01:13:57,570
And nobody...

1829
01:13:57,570 --> 01:13:58,830
Okay, get over here, B.

1830
01:13:59,170 --> 01:14:00,770
Eat asphalt, asphalt eaters!

1831
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:02,050
Wait, I can't run it over?

1832
01:14:02,290 --> 01:14:03,350
Oh, awesome, man!

1833
01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:03,910
That was the best one I've ever heard!

1834
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:07,270
Sorry, I nearly spoiled the ending of the Simpsons game right there.

1835
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:10,690
Sorry, guys!

1836
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:14,510
No, I'm too short!

1837
01:14:17,310 --> 01:14:17,950
Okay.

1838
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:20,670
Yeah, that's how it...

1839
01:14:20,670 --> 01:14:21,730
That's how it ends.

1840
01:14:22,210 --> 01:14:24,250
I like how I double down too.

1841
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:29,770
That's right, and I'll double down, spoiling it!

1842
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:34,920
Alright.

1843
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:36,280
Oh, my skull!

1844
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:44,720
But I always...

1845
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:45,380
Oh, I want to...

1846
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:45,800
Wait, there.

1847
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:49,560
I think the Krusty place also has money too.

1848
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:50,400
Oh, yeah!

1849
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:53,060
Oh, I really want to play the Futurama game.

1850
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:55,920
Because I heard a lot of good things about the game.

1851
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:57,200
And...

1852
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:58,900
It's like...

1853
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:01,420
It's like its own Futurama episode too.

1854
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:03,100
But that's why I like...

1855
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:04,240
I've always wanted to try it.

1856
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,780
Oh, I'm at Krusty's area.

1857
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:07,160
I'm at Krusty's studios.

1858
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:10,040
I've never played it before.

1859
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:13,280
This place has infinite coin frame?

1860
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:14,520
What's the infinite coin frame?

1861
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:19,280
I like playing... I just like... That's why I like streaming in general.

1862
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:23,940
Because streaming helps me play games I never got a chance to grow up with.

1863
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:28,480
Because like, um... I talked about this story... Oh my god, no, not parkour.

1864
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:31,400
I talked about this story before, but like...

1865
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:35,160
Um, I basically just played games that my dad played.

1866
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:36,780
Like, my dad's hand-me-downs.

1867
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:40,080
So, but I was very limited in like, what I could play.

1868
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:44,000
Because my dad would be like, no, these games are for children!

1869
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:46,560
I'm not getting those games.

1870
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:51,000
So like, majority of the games I got to play was like...

1871
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,660
I get to watch my dad play GTA.

1872
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:56,300
Um, and then he would just give me the controller to drive the cars.

1873
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:01,140
And then... Oh, I have 600 dollars!

1874
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:01,720
Yippee!

1875
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:05,800
Um, okay, but do I spend it on Bartman?

1876
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:08,740
Or do I spend it on El Scorpio's car?

1877
01:16:10,660 --> 01:16:11,180
Or...

1878
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:12,100
Or...

1879
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:16,560
So like, he mostly had like, the games, you know, like the typical dude bro games.

1880
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:21,320
So it would be like, Medal of Honor, Call of Duty, um...

1881
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:23,580
Battlegrounds, all that shit.

1882
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,260
So like, those were like, all the games I got to play.

1883
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,920
And then I, I get like, I get to have like, one or...

1884
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:32,400
Like, the games I got to play for myself was...

1885
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,000
Alright guys...

1886
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:37,000
Scorpion's car or Bartman?

1887
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,040
To catch my breath.

1888
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:44,460
Wait, that was the infinite money glitch?

1889
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:48,820
No!

1890
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:52,300
This was infinite!

1891
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:54,360
I was like, whoa, there's a lot of money!

1892
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:57,640
No!

1893
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:03,640
No, we don't say...

1894
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:04,920
I live with my mis...

1895
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,400
I live with my crimes.

1896
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:07,280
I...

1897
01:17:10,180 --> 01:17:12,480
I was too busy...

1898
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:13,740
Telling a story!

1899
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:15,840
And being a...

1900
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,380
Why did I do my job as a streamer?

1901
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:19,060
Why?

1902
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:25,840
Why am I so good at my job?

1903
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,000
Try to entertain...

1904
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:36,900
No, it's too late.

1905
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:39,080
I shall live with my crimes.

1906
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:40,420
I...

1907
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:40,600
I...

1908
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:42,940
And then you have distracted you.

1909
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,240
I live with my crimes.

1910
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:46,540
Now it's permanent.

1911
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:48,300
Alright, car...

1912
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:49,980
Car...

1913
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:50,700
Apartment.

1914
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:52,300
I saw more...

1915
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:53,160
Um...

1916
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:54,260
So, um...

1917
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:57,920
Car is necessary, but...

1918
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:58,560
Okay, let's go...

1919
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,100
Alright, so we'll get a thousand...

1920
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:01,700
We just need a thousand two hundred then.

1921
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,500
Well, we can get a thousand two hundred.

1922
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:04,220
I didn't play so many video games.

1923
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:05,160
I'd be in better shape.

1924
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:07,240
Alright, let's see.

1925
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:09,440
I'm just gonna run until I can steal a car.

1926
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:10,880
I can buy it.

1927
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,280
I can get a thousand two hundred.

1928
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:14,820
All right.

1929
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:16,240
We'll get both.

1930
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:18,360
Oh, wait.

1931
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:18,740
You're right.

1932
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:19,760
I should just buy the car.

1933
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:21,280
Why the fuck am I stealing a car?

1934
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:22,520
I have money.

1935
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:29,200
As you can see, my brain's not working right now.

1936
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:30,360
Alright, we'll buy the car now.

1937
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:30,900
Hey, Kearney.

1938
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:35,080
Uh, Tiger, welcome to the tomato farm.

1939
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:35,820
Welcome, welcome.

1940
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,060
Alex, thank you for the super chat.

1941
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:38,880
Thank you, thank you.

1942
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:43,480
Doki, I saw a show today, but then I saw the persona through your relocation, and now I'm conflicted.

1943
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:45,500
Okay, but like, why not both?

1944
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:47,120
One can be like the...

1945
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:51,320
One can be part of your shrine, and then the other one, I guess...

1946
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:52,680
I guess...

1947
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:57,540
Okay, but like, does persona say thank you for the super chat, Alex?

1948
01:18:57,780 --> 01:18:58,900
Thank you, thank you.

1949
01:18:59,180 --> 01:18:59,880
That's right.

1950
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:03,120
Can persona say your name?

1951
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:04,280
That's right.

1952
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:07,360
Wait, did I not buy the car?

1953
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:09,120
Oh no, it's right here.

1954
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:13,180
I acknowledge you.

1955
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,200
Holy shit, it's such a...

1956
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,100
Oh my god, wait, this car is fast.

1957
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:23,620
That's right, Alex.

1958
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:25,100
Can't acknowledge.

1959
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:26,500
Oh my god, whoops.

1960
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:30,240
Alright, oh my god, this car is a little bit too fast.

1961
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:30,760
I think.

1962
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,860
This car may or may not be too fast.

1963
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:37,740
Whoa, thank you for the super chat.

1964
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:38,440
Thank you, thank you.

1965
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:39,100
Oh my god.

1966
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:41,220
Why did I not read that super chat earlier?

1967
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:41,920
Why?

1968
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,100
That was the super chat.

1969
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:47,080
That told me about the infinite glitch.

1970
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:50,200
As multiple crates, they break after three.

1971
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:54,160
So as long as you hit each box two times and then mission warp, you have your...

1972
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:55,480
Oh my god.

1973
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:57,940
Oh my god.

1974
01:19:57,940 --> 01:20:01,420
I just needed to read a little earlier.

1975
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:02,260
I...

1976
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,200
Thank you for the super chat.

1977
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:07,340
Thank you, thank you.

1978
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:11,140
Okay, at least we got the car we need that's mandatory.

1979
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,020
I hope this car can take it.

1980
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:14,160
I don't know if I have...

1981
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:14,540
Can...

1982
01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:17,760
You think I can get 600 chat?

1983
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:22,160
I don't think I can get Bartman immediately, but then like...

1984
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:22,860
What's the point?

1985
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:26,640
Alright, let's just head back.

1986
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:29,020
Guys, I don't think I can get it back in time.

1987
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,120
Oh wait, but there's a box down there.

1988
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:32,400
Oh, but then there's the lighthouse.

1989
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:33,560
Oh, I'm getting distracted.

1990
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:38,820
Just go back down.

1991
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:40,000
Wee!

1992
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:44,340
All right.

1993
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:46,620
Oh, but I can go down here.

1994
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:49,900
Oh, I can't.

1995
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:54,540
Never mind.

1996
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:56,520
I can't go down there.

1997
01:20:56,620 --> 01:20:57,600
I can go down here.

1998
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:00,060
Okay.

1999
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:02,540
Wait, why is the captain here?

2000
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:04,140
There has to be plot.

2001
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:06,360
There has to be like money here somewhere.

2002
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,420
Oh, there's...

2003
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:08,900
There's a box.

2004
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:10,400
E.

2005
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:13,100
Oh, there's another box.

2006
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:15,720
Oop.

2007
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:17,860
All right.

2008
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:19,800
We have almost 200.

2009
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:22,260
So, we have 400 left.

2010
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:25,360
I think there has to be 400 somewhere.

2011
01:21:27,660 --> 01:21:29,480
Oh my god, I'm so lost.

2012
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:32,980
There has to be another box somewhere.

2013
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:33,780
I feel...

2014
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:37,180
I feel like I haven't explored everything yet.

2015
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,340
Please, where are all the boxes?

2016
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:45,420
Jimbo!

2017
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:46,180
Not Jimbo, sorry.

2018
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:46,660
Nelson!

2019
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,220
Sorry, all you bullies look the same.

2020
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:53,800
Pass me more boxes somewhere.

2021
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:54,680
Oh, wait.

2022
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:56,080
No, he doesn't give me anything.

2023
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:57,780
Out of the way, wannabe!

2024
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:59,460
This is not...

2025
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:00,180
Oh, whoops.

2026
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:01,760
All right.

2027
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:04,580
All right.

2028
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:05,620
Nice.

2029
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:07,000
No, I can't.

2030
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:08,280
Guys, I cannot do another race.

2031
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:09,900
I'm not strong enough.

2032
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:12,740
I'm not strong enough.

2033
01:22:14,980 --> 01:22:16,040
I'm weak.

2034
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:19,780
I'm too weak to do another race.

2035
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:20,380
Guys.

2036
01:22:24,450 --> 01:22:25,970
There has to be more.

2037
01:22:26,510 --> 01:22:28,570
I just know I'm gonna be blamed for this.

2038
01:22:28,570 --> 01:22:29,770
Where are all the boxes?

2039
01:22:30,890 --> 01:22:32,350
I don't understand.

2040
01:22:33,190 --> 01:22:34,970
I don't remember these being here before.

2041
01:22:35,370 --> 01:22:37,190
Oh, this is too cool for school.

2042
01:22:37,690 --> 01:22:39,390
Where are all the boxes?

2043
01:22:41,130 --> 01:22:42,250
I didn't know.

2044
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:44,310
Do it for loop.

2045
01:22:46,630 --> 01:22:49,430
That's exactly where I'm at when I don't do it.

2046
01:22:50,910 --> 01:22:52,290
Okay, there's a box right here.

2047
01:22:52,430 --> 01:22:52,790
Oh, wait, wait.

2048
01:22:52,890 --> 01:22:53,850
The Krusty account.

2049
01:22:54,190 --> 01:22:55,190
There has to be some out here.

2050
01:22:57,610 --> 01:22:58,350
I knew it.

2051
01:22:58,950 --> 01:22:59,670
I knew it.

2052
01:22:59,790 --> 01:23:00,770
I knew you existed.

2053
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:02,330
Get over here, bee.

2054
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:06,290
Okay, I'm definitely not...

2055
01:23:06,290 --> 01:23:07,610
Oh, are you fucking whore?

2056
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:10,990
Are you...

2057
01:23:10,990 --> 01:23:11,230
Please!

2058
01:23:13,970 --> 01:23:14,690
They disappeared!

2059
01:23:16,050 --> 01:23:16,990
Oh, my God.

2060
01:23:17,170 --> 01:23:17,670
Okay, it's fine.

2061
01:23:17,790 --> 01:23:18,010
It's fine.

2062
01:23:18,110 --> 01:23:18,650
Everything's fine.

2063
01:23:20,090 --> 01:23:20,870
Everything's okay.

2064
01:23:23,610 --> 01:23:24,690
Okay, I have 300.

2065
01:23:24,950 --> 01:23:25,410
I'm halfway.

2066
01:23:28,310 --> 01:23:30,050
Guys, I don't think I'm gonna make it.

2067
01:23:30,970 --> 01:23:33,450
I don't think I'm gonna make it, guys.

2068
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:37,190
Guys, no, please.

2069
01:23:37,410 --> 01:23:37,870
I cannot.

2070
01:23:39,530 --> 01:23:41,390
I'm not strong enough.

2071
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:47,070
I'm not strong enough to do...

2072
01:23:47,070 --> 01:23:48,890
To do the...

2073
01:23:50,090 --> 01:23:51,590
To do the races.

2074
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:55,170
Wait, where's my car?

2075
01:23:57,690 --> 01:23:58,250
Where's...

2076
01:23:58,250 --> 01:23:59,430
Where's Scorpion?

2077
01:24:00,090 --> 01:24:00,910
Oh, there it is.

2078
01:24:01,190 --> 01:24:01,790
Attention cars.

2079
01:24:02,010 --> 01:24:03,950
Ten-year-old hitchhiker needs a ride.

2080
01:24:03,950 --> 01:24:04,470
All right.

2081
01:24:04,650 --> 01:24:05,130
All right.

2082
01:24:05,130 --> 01:24:05,890
We'll just get...

2083
01:24:05,890 --> 01:24:07,870
We'll get Bartman another day.

2084
01:24:09,050 --> 01:24:11,870
Surely, we'll bump into something else that has money.

2085
01:24:13,830 --> 01:24:14,270
Surely.

2086
01:24:14,710 --> 01:24:15,250
Oh, yeah, baby.

2087
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:16,050
Bring it on.

2088
01:24:16,170 --> 01:24:16,590
It's okay.

2089
01:24:16,830 --> 01:24:17,430
I have...

2090
01:24:17,430 --> 01:24:18,490
I have a cool car.

2091
01:24:20,190 --> 01:24:20,750
All right.

2092
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:22,370
We'll do one race.

2093
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:24,290
One race.

2094
01:24:24,290 --> 01:24:25,850
You and me are having...

2095
01:24:25,850 --> 01:24:26,770
All right.

2096
01:24:28,110 --> 01:24:29,010
Three, two, one.

2097
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:30,250
How much money do I get?

2098
01:24:31,010 --> 01:24:31,030
I did it.

2099
01:24:31,030 --> 01:24:32,470
Wait, I'm racing my dad?

2100
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:35,450
Okay, guys.

2101
01:24:36,230 --> 01:24:37,370
I'm already giving up.

2102
01:24:42,190 --> 01:24:43,470
Okay, guys.

2103
01:24:44,410 --> 01:24:45,090
Okay.

2104
01:24:48,110 --> 01:24:48,790
Yeah.

2105
01:24:49,670 --> 01:24:51,770
This doesn't look so good.

2106
01:24:52,950 --> 01:24:55,050
And he can take shortcuts?

2107
01:24:55,370 --> 01:24:56,770
That fucking cheated.

2108
01:24:59,290 --> 01:25:00,050
All right.

2109
01:25:00,250 --> 01:25:00,990
All right.

2110
01:25:01,710 --> 01:25:02,510
I give up.

2111
01:25:04,670 --> 01:25:06,190
I'm driving back.

2112
01:25:08,530 --> 01:25:09,950
That's not even Ralph.

2113
01:25:10,150 --> 01:25:10,750
That's Homer.

2114
01:25:12,810 --> 01:25:14,590
Wait, how do I get back home?

2115
01:25:15,890 --> 01:25:16,690
That's it.

2116
01:25:16,830 --> 01:25:17,890
I'm going back home.

2117
01:25:18,510 --> 01:25:20,590
He can drive back for all I care.

2118
01:25:21,770 --> 01:25:22,130
That's right.

2119
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:22,870
Fuck you, cop.

2120
01:25:23,930 --> 01:25:24,670
That's right.

2121
01:25:24,890 --> 01:25:25,670
I'm angry.

2122
01:25:27,970 --> 01:25:29,530
I think my car will be okay.

2123
01:25:31,130 --> 01:25:31,830
It's all right.

2124
01:25:31,950 --> 01:25:32,590
I'll wait here.

2125
01:25:32,970 --> 01:25:33,050
That was so bad.

2126
01:25:33,190 --> 01:25:33,550
No.

2127
01:25:36,410 --> 01:25:39,070
That's why I came back to the observatory.

2128
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:42,410
All right.

2129
01:25:42,950 --> 01:25:43,950
Things are fine.

2130
01:25:45,370 --> 01:25:45,690
Yeah.

2131
01:25:48,350 --> 01:25:49,310
All right, professor.

2132
01:25:50,630 --> 01:25:51,450
It's all right.

2133
01:25:51,650 --> 01:25:52,750
My car will be okay.

2134
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:56,430
All right.

2135
01:25:56,570 --> 01:25:57,190
What was my mission?

2136
01:25:57,490 --> 01:25:59,670
Drive to the brewery and stop the alien's plan.

2137
01:25:59,970 --> 01:26:02,870
Hit the truck and collect the laser guns.

2138
01:26:03,550 --> 01:26:03,990
Okay.

2139
01:26:05,970 --> 01:26:08,430
Well, it's a good thing my other car was broken.

2140
01:26:08,810 --> 01:26:09,360
That means...

2141
01:26:10,310 --> 01:26:12,090
Thank God I can use a different car.

2142
01:26:14,190 --> 01:26:16,490
Children weren't meant to get this much exercise.

2143
01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:17,010
All right.

2144
01:26:17,850 --> 01:26:20,330
What is good for smashy smashy?

2145
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:23,710
What was a good smashy smashy car?

2146
01:26:25,090 --> 01:26:25,650
Uh...

2147
01:26:25,650 --> 01:26:26,570
Mr. Plow.

2148
01:26:27,430 --> 01:26:28,430
Okay, we'll do...

2149
01:26:28,430 --> 01:26:29,470
We'll do Mr. Plow.

2150
01:26:29,650 --> 01:26:31,730
This is Bart Simpson requesting one pimp ride ASAP.

2151
01:26:31,730 --> 01:26:32,030
Oh, whoa.

2152
01:26:32,670 --> 01:26:35,490
I guess I also forgot to repair this car, too.

2153
01:26:38,730 --> 01:26:39,250
Okay.

2154
01:26:39,930 --> 01:26:40,450
Whoa.

2155
01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:42,970
That's a little awkward.

2156
01:26:44,210 --> 01:26:46,550
I forgot to repair that car as well.

2157
01:26:47,070 --> 01:26:47,830
That's okay.

2158
01:26:48,270 --> 01:26:49,110
Things will be okay.

2159
01:26:49,850 --> 01:26:50,990
Everything will be okay.

2160
01:26:51,170 --> 01:26:51,570
I'll just...

2161
01:26:51,570 --> 01:26:52,670
Oh, there's a screwdriver right here.

2162
01:26:52,830 --> 01:26:53,150
Nice.

2163
01:26:54,010 --> 01:26:55,330
See, I told you guys.

2164
01:26:56,190 --> 01:26:56,450
Oh.

2165
01:26:57,150 --> 01:26:57,470
All right.

2166
01:26:57,510 --> 01:26:58,890
This is a screwdriver plan.

2167
01:26:59,650 --> 01:27:01,170
This is not to get to the brewery.

2168
01:27:01,290 --> 01:27:02,330
It's just to get the screwdriver.

2169
01:27:02,330 --> 01:27:02,810
Oh, man.

2170
01:27:03,070 --> 01:27:03,570
This sucks.

2171
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:05,570
Eh.

2172
01:27:06,690 --> 01:27:07,770
Can't be that far.

2173
01:27:08,410 --> 01:27:09,550
Oh, it was pretty far.

2174
01:27:13,290 --> 01:27:14,050
Never mind.

2175
01:27:14,950 --> 01:27:15,350
Wait.

2176
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:16,110
I think I can make it.

2177
01:27:16,930 --> 01:27:17,410
Wait.

2178
01:27:17,470 --> 01:27:17,990
It's right there.

2179
01:27:18,790 --> 01:27:19,270
Wait.

2180
01:27:19,330 --> 01:27:19,750
I think...

2181
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:20,410
I can't make it.

2182
01:27:20,550 --> 01:27:20,970
Never mind.

2183
01:27:21,630 --> 01:27:23,270
That was a rollercoaster of emotions.

2184
01:27:23,950 --> 01:27:24,290
That...

2185
01:27:24,290 --> 01:27:25,210
That...

2186
01:27:25,210 --> 01:27:27,550
That was...

2187
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:30,710
That was...

2188
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:32,310
Unfortunately, I didn't make it.

2189
01:27:37,230 --> 01:27:42,170
I had a very high sense of hope.

2190
01:27:42,910 --> 01:27:44,950
But hope was always a mistake.

2191
01:27:45,670 --> 01:27:48,370
If you're never hopeful, everything is...

2192
01:27:48,370 --> 01:27:49,590
Everything will be a surprise.

2193
01:27:52,010 --> 01:27:53,390
That's my motto.

2194
01:27:56,350 --> 01:27:56,950
Okay.

2195
01:27:57,510 --> 01:27:58,390
Go this way.

2196
01:27:59,170 --> 01:28:00,290
And then...

2197
01:28:00,290 --> 01:28:01,790
I think you make it.

2198
01:28:02,030 --> 01:28:02,110
Okay.

2199
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:02,190
Go this way.

2200
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:02,230
And then...

2201
01:28:02,230 --> 01:28:02,790
The staff.

2202
01:28:03,910 --> 01:28:04,950
Jesus Christ.

2203
01:28:05,170 --> 01:28:05,670
This is so hard.

2204
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:06,510
I don't remember.

2205
01:28:06,910 --> 01:28:07,170
No!

2206
01:28:09,230 --> 01:28:09,750
No!

2207
01:28:11,350 --> 01:28:13,110
I'm trying right out of turn!

2208
01:28:18,010 --> 01:28:19,270
How do you turn?

2209
01:28:19,270 --> 01:28:19,490
How do you turn?

2210
01:28:22,790 --> 01:28:23,910
Oh, my God.

2211
01:28:24,210 --> 01:28:25,270
Move it or lose it, Tool.

2212
01:28:25,290 --> 01:28:26,690
Oh, I remember how to turn, guys.

2213
01:28:27,210 --> 01:28:27,970
Guys, I remember.

2214
01:28:28,410 --> 01:28:28,930
I...

2215
01:28:28,930 --> 01:28:29,570
Oh, my God.

2216
01:28:29,590 --> 01:28:30,450
This is a conspiracy.

2217
01:28:31,030 --> 01:28:32,070
This is a conspiracy.

2218
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:32,890
I give up.

2219
01:28:33,690 --> 01:28:34,690
I restart.

2220
01:28:38,750 --> 01:28:39,810
No, it's fine.

2221
01:28:40,330 --> 01:28:41,530
This will work out.

2222
01:28:41,670 --> 01:28:43,410
Mr. Plow is fast enough.

2223
01:28:43,810 --> 01:28:45,230
Also, thank you for the super chat.

2224
01:28:45,370 --> 01:28:45,570
Thank you.

2225
01:28:45,730 --> 01:28:46,370
Thank you.

2226
01:28:46,610 --> 01:28:47,750
I really appreciate it.

2227
01:28:48,010 --> 01:28:50,010
I'm sorry I can't read out your name right now.

2228
01:28:50,870 --> 01:28:52,550
I don't know how to read that.

2229
01:28:53,550 --> 01:28:54,630
I'll learn later.

2230
01:28:54,630 --> 01:28:59,990
Well, I can ult-tap, but I can't because if I ult-tap, I lose my game.

2231
01:29:02,850 --> 01:29:03,330
Okay.

2232
01:29:04,270 --> 01:29:04,810
Don't worry.

2233
01:29:04,910 --> 01:29:05,890
This car is fast enough.

2234
01:29:06,190 --> 01:29:07,030
Trust the process.

2235
01:29:08,170 --> 01:29:09,770
Trust the process, guys.

2236
01:29:11,630 --> 01:29:12,850
Eat asphalt, asphalt eaters.

2237
01:29:12,850 --> 01:29:14,990
Okay, maybe stop trusting the process.

2238
01:29:16,030 --> 01:29:16,650
I didn't...

2239
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:17,190
Oh, is it Haku?

2240
01:29:17,390 --> 01:29:18,470
Thank you for the super chat, Haku.

2241
01:29:18,630 --> 01:29:18,870
Thank you.

2242
01:29:18,990 --> 01:29:19,350
Thank you.

2243
01:29:19,670 --> 01:29:23,090
Guys, I think it's because you guys are not trusting the process.

2244
01:29:25,270 --> 01:29:26,130
Guys, okay.

2245
01:29:27,770 --> 01:29:28,330
Um...

2246
01:29:28,330 --> 01:29:29,050
No!

2247
01:29:29,270 --> 01:29:30,110
I just said yes!

2248
01:29:30,410 --> 01:29:34,870
I forgot to say yes to retry so I can get teleported back.

2249
01:29:38,630 --> 01:29:39,430
It's okay.

2250
01:29:40,470 --> 01:29:41,290
It's okay.

2251
01:29:43,330 --> 01:29:44,530
Things will be fine.

2252
01:29:46,070 --> 01:29:46,530
Oh, man.

2253
01:29:46,630 --> 01:29:47,470
That sucks and blows.

2254
01:29:47,670 --> 01:29:49,750
I'm gonna get another car, guys.

2255
01:29:50,130 --> 01:29:54,830
I think what we learned today is that we might need another car.

2256
01:29:54,830 --> 01:29:55,830
We might...

2257
01:29:58,230 --> 01:30:00,610
We might need another car.

2258
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:03,770
I can't repair...

2259
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:04,810
No, we don't need this yet.

2260
01:30:07,530 --> 01:30:09,750
Yeah, this car is a little too slow.

2261
01:30:10,830 --> 01:30:13,010
We're gonna head over here.

2262
01:30:14,850 --> 01:30:15,490
Alright.

2263
01:30:17,550 --> 01:30:18,490
Oh, whoops.

2264
01:30:19,930 --> 01:30:21,710
Didn't realize we can block the phone.

2265
01:30:22,610 --> 01:30:23,010
Alright.

2266
01:30:23,490 --> 01:30:23,650
Nice.

2267
01:30:23,870 --> 01:30:23,930
Alright.

2268
01:30:24,050 --> 01:30:25,690
We call it a different car in advance.

2269
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:26,910
Okay.

2270
01:30:27,350 --> 01:30:28,410
What is fast?

2271
01:30:28,790 --> 01:30:29,190
Toughness?

2272
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:29,730
Okay.

2273
01:30:30,850 --> 01:30:33,710
We need to have toughness, but it has to be fast, too.

2274
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:36,910
Oh, there's so many cars I haven't unlocked.

2275
01:30:40,690 --> 01:30:41,430
You know what?

2276
01:30:41,430 --> 01:30:41,530
What?

2277
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:43,210
This car has never failed me.

2278
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:45,570
I've always believed in you.

2279
01:30:52,070 --> 01:30:54,070
You have never failed me.

2280
01:30:56,610 --> 01:30:58,550
You've bankrupted a company.

2281
01:31:00,150 --> 01:31:01,850
Surely it will be okay.

2282
01:31:01,850 --> 01:31:01,970
Okay.

2283
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:06,360
Alright.

2284
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:09,560
That'll be fine.

2285
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:11,500
Yay!

2286
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:16,480
Alright, here we go.

2287
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,840
Okay, we're definitely a lot faster now.

2288
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:24,120
Alright.

2289
01:31:24,820 --> 01:31:25,380
This...

2290
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:26,900
This is looking hopeful, guys.

2291
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:30,220
Oh my god.

2292
01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:31,560
Look how fast we are.

2293
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:34,760
Okay, we might make it.

2294
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:36,140
Oh my god.

2295
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:36,520
Please.

2296
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:37,960
Please.

2297
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:38,760
Please.

2298
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:39,160
Please.

2299
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:44,500
Please, I have the right side of the road.

2300
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:47,900
Oh no.

2301
01:31:48,220 --> 01:31:48,420
No.

2302
01:31:48,740 --> 01:31:48,820
No.

2303
01:31:49,820 --> 01:31:50,820
Bump, bump, bump.

2304
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:53,520
Oh my god.

2305
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:53,940
He's right here.

2306
01:31:54,140 --> 01:31:54,920
It's right there.

2307
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:56,120
It's right there.

2308
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:57,740
Nice.

2309
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:58,920
Oh no.

2310
01:31:59,060 --> 01:32:00,360
My car's not strong enough.

2311
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:01,700
It's a giant truck.

2312
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:05,940
Oh my god.

2313
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:07,720
Oh my god.

2314
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:08,520
But it hit me!

2315
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:12,240
Oh my god.

2316
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:12,700
Hit yourself.

2317
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:13,800
Hit yourself, please.

2318
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:16,440
Okay.

2319
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:17,840
This is too cool for school.

2320
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:21,200
Oh no.

2321
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:22,140
There's too many people.

2322
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:23,560
What are you doing here?

2323
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,240
This is for cars only!

2324
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:31,800
Okay, I feel like this car...

2325
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:34,080
If he hits other things, he should drop stuff.

2326
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:35,060
It shouldn't be just me.

2327
01:32:35,980 --> 01:32:37,640
It shouldn't be just me.

2328
01:32:37,980 --> 01:32:39,740
It should be a group effort.

2329
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:41,300
With me and the environment.

2330
01:32:43,940 --> 01:32:45,620
The environment should count.

2331
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:48,460
Are you fucking kidding me?

2332
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:51,560
You could have dropped it any other way!

2333
01:32:58,180 --> 01:33:04,440
You could have dropped this any other way and you drop it on the side that I was not driving towards.

2334
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,920
My butt hurts.

2335
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:07,220
Get out of the way.

2336
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:12,020
Get out!

2337
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:15,260
I honked!

2338
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:15,480
I honked!

2339
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:16,980
That was totally awesome!

2340
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:20,940
Oh my god.

2341
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:21,300
Children.

2342
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:22,160
Children.

2343
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:22,680
Get out!

2344
01:33:25,460 --> 01:33:26,140
Oh my god.

2345
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:26,400
Nice.

2346
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:27,560
Okay.

2347
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,820
Drive to the brewery.

2348
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:29,840
Where's the brewery?

2349
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:30,740
Where is it?

2350
01:33:30,860 --> 01:33:31,620
Oh my god.

2351
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:31,800
Oh my god.

2352
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:32,940
It's all the way back.

2353
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:33,800
Oh my god.

2354
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:34,740
In the cops!

2355
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:38,020
Oh my god!

2356
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:40,780
Eat my dust, Dust Eaters.

2357
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:42,460
What is this?

2358
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:43,300
No!

2359
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:45,360
Ah!

2360
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:47,740
This is too cool for school.

2361
01:33:48,020 --> 01:33:49,600
I'm trying to go through this hole!

2362
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:53,080
Eat my dust, Dust Eaters.

2363
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:54,620
Oh my god.

2364
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:57,560
I wanted to take the shortcut.

2365
01:33:59,220 --> 01:33:59,640
No!

2366
01:33:59,780 --> 01:34:01,320
I missed the other shortcut!

2367
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:06,500
I missed the other shortcut.

2368
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:09,120
I'm a mess.

2369
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:10,320
I'm a mess.

2370
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:10,880
I'm a mess right now.

2371
01:34:13,220 --> 01:34:14,280
Oh no.

2372
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:16,560
Oh no.

2373
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:18,100
We're not gonna make it.

2374
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:19,840
Please!

2375
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:21,760
Get off the road!

2376
01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:26,380
How am I supposed to not hit anyone?

2377
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:31,320
It's not fair!

2378
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:33,840
It's not fair!

2379
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:34,500
It's not fair!

2380
01:34:42,860 --> 01:34:46,820
It was right there!

2381
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:49,360
It was right there!

2382
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:50,120
It was right there!

2383
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:57,820
It was right there!

2384
01:34:58,740 --> 01:35:00,300
It was right there!

2385
01:35:00,940 --> 01:35:07,060
It was right there!

2386
01:35:07,060 --> 01:35:08,080
Why?

2387
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:12,480
Why B?

2388
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,040
I pay taxes!

2389
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:18,580
Oh, I'm not even gonna make it.

2390
01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:20,940
I'm not even gonna make it.

2391
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:25,820
I'm not even gonna make it!

2392
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:29,300
It's not fair.

2393
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:32,460
Why punish the ones that pay their taxes?

2394
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,060
Oh my god, thank god.

2395
01:35:36,060 --> 01:35:37,360
Fuck you, Carl.

2396
01:35:41,950 --> 01:35:42,450
Okay.

2397
01:35:44,170 --> 01:35:45,090
Okay, we got it.

2398
01:35:45,610 --> 01:35:46,110
Nice.

2399
01:35:46,270 --> 01:35:47,490
We got two items.

2400
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:53,920
Taxpayers should get, like, an exemption.

2401
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:56,480
Did I... Oh, I grabbed one.

2402
01:35:56,700 --> 01:35:56,940
Okay.

2403
01:35:58,340 --> 01:35:59,800
Oh my god.

2404
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:02,580
Why can't they arrest him?

2405
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:04,560
Look at all the people he's hitting over!

2406
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:08,140
And I run over one child!

2407
01:36:08,580 --> 01:36:09,740
And then I...

2408
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:11,080
I'm the bad guy!

2409
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:12,860
Oh my god!

2410
01:36:13,060 --> 01:36:14,280
Are you serious?

2411
01:36:14,740 --> 01:36:18,520
Are you serious?

2412
01:36:19,740 --> 01:36:21,060
Are you serious?

2413
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:24,200
I run over one child!

2414
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:27,420
And then I become the bad guy!

2415
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:33,040
Like, do they ever think that the child is in the wrong?

2416
01:36:33,540 --> 01:36:34,940
What was she doing here?

2417
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:35,800
Where are her parents?

2418
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:37,080
It's the parents' fault.

2419
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:38,100
That's totally awesome.

2420
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:42,800
All I'm saying is it's the parents' fault for not supervising the child.

2421
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:45,640
And having her just walk on the road like that.

2422
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:51,260
Just... That's all I'm saying.

2423
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:57,440
We wouldn't be in this mess if they looked at their... They, like, monitored your children better.

2424
01:37:01,330 --> 01:37:03,330
Oh my god, where am I?

2425
01:37:08,010 --> 01:37:10,470
Like, we have an overpopulation problem!

2426
01:37:10,870 --> 01:37:14,990
If anything, I'm doing... I'm doing the world justice!

2427
01:37:17,070 --> 01:37:17,550
Alright.

2428
01:37:17,850 --> 01:37:19,830
Out of context, Clippers.

2429
01:37:20,250 --> 01:37:20,370
Hi.

2430
01:37:20,950 --> 01:37:21,510
Hello.

2431
01:37:21,970 --> 01:37:23,510
Thank you for the super chat wings.

2432
01:37:23,790 --> 01:37:24,370
Thank you, thank you.

2433
01:37:24,630 --> 01:37:27,750
I have to find the super... Where's the super laser?

2434
01:37:28,510 --> 01:37:29,870
Where is it?

2435
01:37:30,190 --> 01:37:32,510
There's another... Oh my god.

2436
01:37:33,330 --> 01:37:33,550
Okay.

2437
01:37:33,770 --> 01:37:35,050
I have to find the super laser.

2438
01:37:35,230 --> 01:37:36,130
Wherever the fuck that is.

2439
01:37:37,210 --> 01:37:37,970
Where is it?

2440
01:37:38,090 --> 01:37:38,730
Oh my god.

2441
01:37:38,890 --> 01:37:39,550
It's right there.

2442
01:37:41,790 --> 01:37:42,730
That's right there.

2443
01:37:44,630 --> 01:37:45,710
Oh, I finished it.

2444
01:37:45,870 --> 01:37:46,410
Oh, thank god.

2445
01:37:47,890 --> 01:37:49,490
It's just survival of the fittest.

2446
01:37:49,570 --> 01:37:52,330
If you survive my cars, you deserve to live.

2447
01:37:52,490 --> 01:37:53,690
I am such a sellout.

2448
01:37:56,190 --> 01:38:02,990
All I'm saying... If you survive the doki experience, you deserve to live your life.

2449
01:38:05,150 --> 01:38:05,670
Okay.

2450
01:38:05,930 --> 01:38:05,930
Okay.

2451
01:38:06,190 --> 01:38:08,750
I have to go to... Where is that?

2452
01:38:12,550 --> 01:38:13,070
Alright.

2453
01:38:13,070 --> 01:38:13,890
It's right here.

2454
01:38:15,190 --> 01:38:16,150
So... Here.

2455
01:38:16,390 --> 01:38:17,350
And then we turn this way.

2456
01:38:17,570 --> 01:38:18,370
Oh, there it is.

2457
01:38:19,950 --> 01:38:20,910
The Taffy Land.

2458
01:38:22,110 --> 01:38:22,410
Alright.

2459
01:38:22,430 --> 01:38:23,390
I need to save my game.

2460
01:38:25,350 --> 01:38:25,870
Yeah.

2461
01:38:25,870 --> 01:38:27,570
If you don't die, you deserve to live.

2462
01:38:27,770 --> 01:38:28,090
Exactly.

2463
01:38:28,190 --> 01:38:28,970
It's just that easy.

2464
01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:29,290
Where is he?

2465
01:38:33,230 --> 01:38:34,190
Principal Skinner.

2466
01:38:34,610 --> 01:38:37,670
Aliens are distributing deadly lasers all over Springfield.

2467
01:38:37,970 --> 01:38:39,110
We gotta warn everybody.

2468
01:38:39,210 --> 01:38:39,730
Don't go.

2469
01:38:39,970 --> 01:38:40,730
Thank you for the 20.

2470
01:38:40,770 --> 01:38:41,570
Get the chips.

2471
01:38:41,690 --> 01:38:41,870
Thank you.

2472
01:38:42,030 --> 01:38:42,550
Thank you.

2473
01:38:43,170 --> 01:38:45,450
Clearly, you forgot the school zero time.

2474
01:38:45,630 --> 01:38:45,830
The solution.

2475
01:38:45,830 --> 01:38:46,190
I'm the solution.

2476
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:52,370
And take back the laser gun before time runs out.

2477
01:38:53,090 --> 01:38:54,390
Where the fuck is his car?

2478
01:38:54,910 --> 01:38:55,830
Oh, that's his car.

2479
01:38:56,370 --> 01:38:58,090
Eat asphalt, asphalt eaters.

2480
01:38:58,390 --> 01:38:58,570
Okay.

2481
01:38:58,710 --> 01:38:59,930
I'll educate you a new one.

2482
01:39:00,130 --> 01:39:00,470
Alright.

2483
01:39:00,530 --> 01:39:02,610
I just realized this car is not meant for ramming.

2484
01:39:03,550 --> 01:39:04,890
That's not gonna stop me.

2485
01:39:06,290 --> 01:39:07,650
That's not gonna stop me.

2486
01:39:07,910 --> 01:39:10,070
Oh, and you brought your mom over too?

2487
01:39:10,630 --> 01:39:11,370
That's right.

2488
01:39:11,670 --> 01:39:13,010
Two for one special.

2489
01:39:16,310 --> 01:39:18,670
That's two people that I'm gonna...

2490
01:39:18,670 --> 01:39:21,190
Two people that I'm gonna save the world.

2491
01:39:22,750 --> 01:39:23,250
There we go.

2492
01:39:23,250 --> 01:39:23,430
There we go.

2493
01:39:23,430 --> 01:39:24,930
Now I'll educate you a new one.

2494
01:39:26,870 --> 01:39:27,310
Meh.

2495
01:39:28,230 --> 01:39:28,810
That's right.

2496
01:39:29,110 --> 01:39:29,890
Time to lay some rubber down.

2497
01:39:30,010 --> 01:39:31,450
I'll take you back to the edge.

2498
01:39:32,150 --> 01:39:33,250
Fire in the hole.

2499
01:39:34,090 --> 01:39:35,710
Alright, we gotta put you against the wall.

2500
01:39:36,350 --> 01:39:37,510
Wait, yo, you're ramming me?

2501
01:39:37,750 --> 01:39:38,830
No, I ram you!

2502
01:39:40,970 --> 01:39:42,770
Now I'll educate you a new one.

2503
01:39:42,990 --> 01:39:43,230
Okay.

2504
01:39:43,230 --> 01:39:44,450
My dad will pay for all the damages.

2505
01:39:44,730 --> 01:39:45,330
Fire in the hole.

2506
01:39:45,330 --> 01:39:45,570
Alright, nice.

2507
01:39:47,690 --> 01:39:47,950
Fire in the hole.

2508
01:39:47,950 --> 01:39:48,550
Okay, where is he going?

2509
01:39:50,130 --> 01:39:50,450
Alright.

2510
01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:52,110
We just gonna have to put him to the side.

2511
01:39:52,850 --> 01:39:53,450
Take that.

2512
01:39:53,590 --> 01:39:53,950
There we go.

2513
01:39:57,510 --> 01:39:58,130
Oh, shit.

2514
01:39:58,270 --> 01:39:59,270
I shouldn't enjoy this so much.

2515
01:39:59,430 --> 01:39:59,790
Oh, shit.

2516
01:39:59,910 --> 01:40:00,250
Oh, shit.

2517
01:40:00,350 --> 01:40:00,370
Oh, shit.

2518
01:40:00,370 --> 01:40:00,670
Big car.

2519
01:40:01,950 --> 01:40:02,430
That's fine.

2520
01:40:02,490 --> 01:40:03,330
He's almost...

2521
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:03,490
Oh, wait.

2522
01:40:03,590 --> 01:40:04,430
He's hitting himself.

2523
01:40:04,590 --> 01:40:05,310
He's hitting himself.

2524
01:40:06,970 --> 01:40:07,930
That's what we like to see.

2525
01:40:09,650 --> 01:40:11,130
I'll educate you a new one.

2526
01:40:11,430 --> 01:40:11,830
That's right.

2527
01:40:12,490 --> 01:40:12,990
Run in.

2528
01:40:13,070 --> 01:40:13,350
Run in.

2529
01:40:13,430 --> 01:40:13,670
Run in.

2530
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:13,970
Yes.

2531
01:40:13,970 --> 01:40:14,050
Yes.

2532
01:40:15,330 --> 01:40:15,870
Okay.

2533
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:17,310
Oh my god.

2534
01:40:17,470 --> 01:40:17,610
Please.

2535
01:40:17,970 --> 01:40:18,850
Run into that.

2536
01:40:19,030 --> 01:40:19,450
Oh my god.

2537
01:40:19,570 --> 01:40:19,630
Yes.

2538
01:40:20,910 --> 01:40:21,210
Yes.

2539
01:40:22,070 --> 01:40:23,250
Keep hitting yourself.

2540
01:40:24,270 --> 01:40:29,050
I feel like with the amount of time they're giving us, there's more to this.

2541
01:40:29,830 --> 01:40:31,370
This has too much time.

2542
01:40:31,710 --> 01:40:32,070
Fire in the hole.

2543
01:40:32,170 --> 01:40:32,970
This is...

2544
01:40:34,410 --> 01:40:34,950
This is...

2545
01:40:36,130 --> 01:40:38,190
This is too much time.

2546
01:40:38,190 --> 01:40:41,270
And if he doesn't believe me now, I'll fry his butt.

2547
01:40:41,990 --> 01:40:43,630
I don't believe it.

2548
01:40:45,190 --> 01:40:48,390
There's no way they would just give me two minutes.

2549
01:40:48,970 --> 01:40:49,870
There's no way.

2550
01:40:49,910 --> 01:40:50,710
I don't believe it.

2551
01:40:50,830 --> 01:40:51,650
I have trust issues.

2552
01:40:51,950 --> 01:40:53,810
I don't believe it.

2553
01:40:54,750 --> 01:40:56,090
There's no way.

2554
01:40:56,910 --> 01:40:58,090
Two minutes?

2555
01:40:58,090 --> 01:41:00,310
There's no way, this game isn't generous.

2556
01:41:01,490 --> 01:41:02,570
There's no way.

2557
01:41:02,970 --> 01:41:04,030
Nothing can be free.

2558
01:41:04,390 --> 01:41:06,350
There's always an exchange of services.

2559
01:41:06,970 --> 01:41:09,750
If it's too good to be true, it's too good to be true.

2560
01:41:11,150 --> 01:41:12,910
Welcome to the real world.

2561
01:41:15,710 --> 01:41:16,270
Okay.

2562
01:41:19,230 --> 01:41:21,250
Alright, here we go.

2563
01:41:21,690 --> 01:41:23,970
Here we go.

2564
01:41:25,610 --> 01:41:26,190
Here we go.

2565
01:41:26,190 --> 01:41:26,790
Here we go.

2566
01:41:28,110 --> 01:41:30,610
Oh my god, this game doesn't even want me to go there.

2567
01:41:30,870 --> 01:41:31,930
He's like, don't go.

2568
01:41:32,250 --> 01:41:33,370
Don't go, Doki.

2569
01:41:33,690 --> 01:41:35,290
You know what lies ahead.

2570
01:41:35,690 --> 01:41:36,530
Don't go.

2571
01:41:37,390 --> 01:41:39,030
Don't do this to yourself.

2572
01:41:43,550 --> 01:41:44,070
Okay.

2573
01:41:47,750 --> 01:41:48,710
I'm scared.

2574
01:41:50,250 --> 01:41:51,130
I'm scared.

2575
01:41:55,110 --> 01:41:57,350
I don't know if I should... What?

2576
01:41:57,490 --> 01:41:58,770
I don't know what I should get.

2577
01:42:00,870 --> 01:42:02,170
I can't save.

2578
01:42:02,670 --> 01:42:03,090
Wait.

2579
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:03,730
Oh, I can!

2580
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:05,690
Okay.

2581
01:42:07,850 --> 01:42:09,010
Alright, I can save.

2582
01:42:09,150 --> 01:42:09,690
Oh, thank god.

2583
01:42:11,310 --> 01:42:13,730
Why did it give me two minutes for a mission?

2584
01:42:14,870 --> 01:42:16,950
Why was it so nice to me?

2585
01:42:18,910 --> 01:42:20,690
It doesn't make sense.

2586
01:42:21,250 --> 01:42:22,630
Krusty, I've got proof now.

2587
01:42:23,030 --> 01:42:23,810
See this laser gun?

2588
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:24,970
Well, what do you know?

2589
01:42:25,310 --> 01:42:26,790
You were telling the truth.

2590
01:42:27,410 --> 01:42:29,550
You've taught this old clown a lesson.

2591
01:42:30,250 --> 01:42:33,230
And blah, blah, blah, blah, etc, etc, stay in school.

2592
01:42:33,510 --> 01:42:37,670
I just wish you told me before I let them set up those free laser gun stands.

2593
01:42:37,950 --> 01:42:38,290
Oh!

2594
01:42:38,530 --> 01:42:38,870
Oh, man.

2595
01:42:39,370 --> 01:42:41,750
I better get some heavy artillery if I'm gonna take out...

2596
01:42:41,750 --> 01:42:42,310
But it's free!

2597
01:42:42,630 --> 01:42:43,830
I love free stuff!

2598
01:42:43,830 --> 01:42:45,050
You should have something good.

2599
01:42:46,550 --> 01:42:48,710
Come late, you will need the Globlex...

2600
01:42:48,710 --> 01:42:48,970
Oh!

2601
01:42:49,170 --> 01:42:49,790
I have it!

2602
01:42:50,250 --> 01:42:50,810
Oh!

2603
01:42:51,190 --> 01:42:52,090
I have it!

2604
01:42:53,370 --> 01:42:53,930
Alright.

2605
01:42:56,030 --> 01:42:57,390
Let's grab that car.

2606
01:43:00,210 --> 01:43:01,410
Okay, let's get this.

2607
01:43:12,990 --> 01:43:15,030
The game is being generous.

2608
01:43:15,290 --> 01:43:17,690
So you can give me a trust issues layer.

2609
01:43:18,170 --> 01:43:21,050
Jokes on them, I've always had trust issues.

2610
01:43:23,830 --> 01:43:27,050
Can't give me more trust issues when I already have it.

2611
01:43:29,190 --> 01:43:32,930
Let's try all the free laser stands in Springfield before time runs out.

2612
01:43:33,630 --> 01:43:34,090
Where's my car?

2613
01:43:34,270 --> 01:43:35,110
Oh my god.

2614
01:43:36,650 --> 01:43:38,110
I should repair that.

2615
01:43:40,930 --> 01:43:46,070
Wait, how do I... Guys, I don't think my car is okay.

2616
01:43:46,710 --> 01:43:49,330
I... sent to kill.

2617
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:50,730
Sent to grow.

2618
01:43:51,070 --> 01:43:53,990
Guys, I don't think my car is okay.

2619
01:43:54,390 --> 01:43:56,170
Let me repair that real quick.

2620
01:43:57,130 --> 01:43:58,770
That's... that's a problem.

2621
01:43:59,090 --> 01:44:01,270
Guys, are cars supposed to be on fire?

2622
01:44:05,170 --> 01:44:08,850
I don't think cars are supposed to be on fire, guys.

2623
01:44:13,570 --> 01:44:17,130
I don't like how you guys said good luck on this mission.

2624
01:44:17,370 --> 01:44:19,170
That does not bring me joy.

2625
01:44:20,610 --> 01:44:22,990
Why can't you make me feel good?

2626
01:44:28,010 --> 01:44:30,970
How come you can't make me feel joy for once?

2627
01:44:33,190 --> 01:44:33,830
Okay.

2628
01:44:35,330 --> 01:44:35,550
Alright.

2629
01:44:35,850 --> 01:44:39,430
Guys, I can already tell this is not looking so good.

2630
01:44:39,790 --> 01:44:42,230
I... I can already tell.

2631
01:44:42,990 --> 01:44:46,490
No, it's a stupid boardwalk mission!

2632
01:44:47,650 --> 01:44:48,670
Where they're so...

2633
01:44:49,230 --> 01:44:50,550
How do I avoid her?

2634
01:44:50,870 --> 01:44:52,810
She's literally on the thing!

2635
01:44:53,190 --> 01:44:54,230
Oh my...

2636
01:44:58,930 --> 01:45:00,370
How is this fair?

2637
01:45:00,610 --> 01:45:02,030
She's literally right there.

2638
01:45:02,890 --> 01:45:04,890
She's like begging to be hit!

2639
01:45:07,390 --> 01:45:08,810
How could that be my fault?

2640
01:45:09,050 --> 01:45:09,490
She's...

2641
01:45:10,410 --> 01:45:11,590
She's sitting next to it.

2642
01:45:11,710 --> 01:45:13,510
At that point, I was doing her a favor.

2643
01:45:14,550 --> 01:45:15,590
I can't see.

2644
01:45:16,430 --> 01:45:17,490
I'm on fire.

2645
01:45:19,430 --> 01:45:21,310
Oh no, this is bad.

2646
01:45:21,730 --> 01:45:24,990
I don't think my car is supposed to be smoking right now.

2647
01:45:25,550 --> 01:45:25,710
I...

2648
01:45:26,470 --> 01:45:26,750
I...

2649
01:45:28,870 --> 01:45:29,990
I don't...

2650
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:31,050
I...

2651
01:45:31,050 --> 01:45:34,410
My car was definitely not supposed to be on fire.

2652
01:45:34,570 --> 01:45:36,070
I can't believe it!

2653
01:45:36,310 --> 01:45:38,030
Why would it do this to me?

2654
01:45:40,090 --> 01:45:40,690
Wee!

2655
01:45:41,090 --> 01:45:41,230
Okay.

2656
01:45:42,150 --> 01:45:42,750
24.

2657
01:45:43,110 --> 01:45:43,710
25.

2658
01:45:43,890 --> 01:45:44,370
Where's 25?

2659
01:45:44,650 --> 01:45:45,430
Where's 25?

2660
01:45:45,670 --> 01:45:47,130
Oh my god, but it's right there.

2661
01:45:47,350 --> 01:45:48,270
Oh my god.

2662
01:45:48,410 --> 01:45:50,690
And I have to go back to Krusty Studios?

2663
01:45:51,750 --> 01:45:52,730
Oh my god.

2664
01:45:54,990 --> 01:45:56,910
I thought the hole was...

2665
01:46:00,050 --> 01:46:01,170
Where am I?

2666
01:46:01,890 --> 01:46:04,170
What direction did he put me in?

2667
01:46:04,570 --> 01:46:05,930
Oh my god.

2668
01:46:07,150 --> 01:46:07,490
I...

2669
01:46:07,490 --> 01:46:08,450
I'm hitting everything.

2670
01:46:08,450 --> 01:46:09,770
I'm hitting...

2671
01:46:09,770 --> 01:46:09,810
I'm hitting...

2672
01:46:09,810 --> 01:46:10,950
Oh, I hate this.

2673
01:46:11,470 --> 01:46:11,990
I...

2674
01:46:15,710 --> 01:46:17,690
Like, I should be exempt!

2675
01:46:18,170 --> 01:46:19,370
Oh my...

2676
01:46:19,370 --> 01:46:20,550
Guys, I'm not making it.

2677
01:46:21,050 --> 01:46:22,890
My car is on fire again.

2678
01:46:23,950 --> 01:46:25,710
My car is on fire.

2679
01:46:26,890 --> 01:46:28,210
I'm not making it.

2680
01:46:28,230 --> 01:46:29,410
There were so many cops.

2681
01:46:30,130 --> 01:46:31,970
They were all out to get me.

2682
01:46:32,710 --> 01:46:34,690
They were all out to just...

2683
01:46:34,690 --> 01:46:35,290
Yeah, that's right.

2684
01:46:35,470 --> 01:46:37,570
Can't arrest me when I fail my mission.

2685
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:39,670
Mine.

2686
01:46:40,370 --> 01:46:41,790
You got it!

2687
01:46:42,510 --> 01:46:44,190
Guys, remember what...

2688
01:46:50,150 --> 01:46:50,790
Okay.

2689
01:46:52,250 --> 01:46:52,570
Okay.

2690
01:46:52,770 --> 01:46:54,090
This is a better start now.

2691
01:46:54,750 --> 01:46:54,890
I...

2692
01:46:54,890 --> 01:46:56,210
I needed to...

2693
01:46:56,210 --> 01:46:59,190
Guys, I needed to have a better start than that.

2694
01:47:01,990 --> 01:47:02,970
Oh my god.

2695
01:47:03,130 --> 01:47:04,390
I'm hitting everything.

2696
01:47:04,570 --> 01:47:06,950
This car is so hard to handle.

2697
01:47:10,210 --> 01:47:10,850
Okay.

2698
01:47:11,970 --> 01:47:12,790
Fine, that's fine.

2699
01:47:13,790 --> 01:47:15,030
Oh my god.

2700
01:47:15,270 --> 01:47:16,710
Oh my god.

2701
01:47:16,850 --> 01:47:18,610
I can't even get corner turns.

2702
01:47:20,490 --> 01:47:21,130
Okay.

2703
01:47:25,870 --> 01:47:27,110
There's nothing I can do.

2704
01:47:27,310 --> 01:47:28,870
I have to hit people.

2705
01:47:29,430 --> 01:47:30,770
I have to...

2706
01:47:30,770 --> 01:47:32,050
Oh and then my car is on fire.

2707
01:47:32,250 --> 01:47:32,670
That's cool.

2708
01:47:33,810 --> 01:47:34,710
You mean there's more?

2709
01:47:35,930 --> 01:47:36,430
Bingo!

2710
01:47:36,570 --> 01:47:36,790
Alright.

2711
01:47:38,850 --> 01:47:39,350
Okay.

2712
01:47:39,990 --> 01:47:42,930
Like, my car is so easily damageable.

2713
01:47:43,830 --> 01:47:49,290
Like, at this point, no companies would give me insurance with this fucking car that I have.

2714
01:47:51,430 --> 01:47:52,330
Oh no.

2715
01:47:52,950 --> 01:47:53,830
Oh no.

2716
01:47:54,710 --> 01:47:54,970
Oh no.

2717
01:47:55,430 --> 01:47:55,770
No!

2718
01:47:56,130 --> 01:47:56,630
My car!

2719
01:47:57,430 --> 01:47:58,570
I can't!

2720
01:47:58,570 --> 01:47:59,630
Just get into the groove.

2721
01:48:02,190 --> 01:48:02,650
Okay.

2722
01:48:05,190 --> 01:48:06,850
And I still get

2723
01:48:19,450 --> 01:48:20,110
a...

2724
01:48:20,110 --> 01:48:22,230
Make it make sense!

2725
01:48:23,470 --> 01:48:25,210
Hey, no way.

2726
01:48:25,970 --> 01:48:26,990
I shouldn't...

2727
01:48:26,990 --> 01:48:29,610
That version of me shouldn't even exist!

2728
01:48:30,490 --> 01:48:31,370
He's gone!

2729
01:48:31,770 --> 01:48:33,510
They wiped him off of history!

2730
01:48:35,870 --> 01:48:36,790
Okay.

2731
01:48:37,110 --> 01:48:37,970
That's fine.

2732
01:48:38,870 --> 01:48:40,550
I didn't need my...

2733
01:48:40,550 --> 01:48:40,730
Guys.

2734
01:48:41,490 --> 01:48:42,950
I'm so sad.

2735
01:48:43,910 --> 01:48:45,570
I'm so sad.

2736
01:48:47,010 --> 01:48:47,670
I'm so sad.

2737
01:48:47,790 --> 01:48:49,390
Thank you for the super chat, Sage.

2738
01:48:49,730 --> 01:48:50,170
Thank you.

2739
01:48:50,330 --> 01:48:50,750
Thank you.

2740
01:48:50,950 --> 01:48:52,290
I hate this area.

2741
01:48:52,790 --> 01:48:54,810
I hate this area so much.

2742
01:48:55,890 --> 01:48:58,270
This area is actually not fair.

2743
01:48:59,330 --> 01:49:03,670
This area actually has the most unfair mechanic in this game.

2744
01:49:05,850 --> 01:49:06,510
Like...

2745
01:49:07,270 --> 01:49:07,910
How...

2746
01:49:07,910 --> 01:49:12,570
Why would they put all these people there and I'm not allowed to run them over?

2747
01:49:13,310 --> 01:49:14,350
It's like...

2748
01:49:14,350 --> 01:49:15,050
Why?

2749
01:49:15,470 --> 01:49:17,350
Why would they tempt me like this?

2750
01:49:20,510 --> 01:49:22,330
It makes no sense.

2751
01:49:23,730 --> 01:49:26,690
Why would they give me such temptations?

2752
01:49:27,490 --> 01:49:28,430
It's like...

2753
01:49:32,230 --> 01:49:34,790
This is like the Adam and Eve situation.

2754
01:49:35,430 --> 01:49:37,130
All these people are like...

2755
01:49:37,130 --> 01:49:38,690
All the apples in my way.

2756
01:49:39,350 --> 01:49:41,250
Eat my dust, dust eaters.

2757
01:49:41,450 --> 01:49:42,710
They're all the apples.

2758
01:49:44,850 --> 01:49:46,230
That's just sitting there.

2759
01:49:46,490 --> 01:49:47,390
Ready to be eaten.

2760
01:49:48,170 --> 01:49:48,550
And then...

2761
01:49:48,550 --> 01:49:49,810
And then God is like...

2762
01:49:49,810 --> 01:49:51,270
You shouldn't eat the apple.

2763
01:49:51,630 --> 01:49:52,250
And I'm like...

2764
01:49:52,250 --> 01:49:54,430
What do you mean I shouldn't eat the apple?

2765
01:49:54,430 --> 01:49:56,210
It's right there.

2766
01:49:56,710 --> 01:49:57,330
It's right there.

2767
01:50:01,620 --> 01:50:04,260
If I wasn't meant to be eating apples...

2768
01:50:04,260 --> 01:50:06,060
Why did you make the apple red?

2769
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:09,040
Why did you make the apple so good?

2770
01:50:11,220 --> 01:50:14,380
Oh no, not again.

2771
01:50:15,860 --> 01:50:17,680
Not again.

2772
01:50:18,760 --> 01:50:19,220
No!

2773
01:50:21,740 --> 01:50:25,280
How are all these people doing so much damage to my car?

2774
01:50:25,900 --> 01:50:26,420
No!

2775
01:50:28,700 --> 01:50:29,740
No!

2776
01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:32,260
They destroyed my car!

2777
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:35,660
The cops destroyed my car!

2778
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:39,100
No problemo!

2779
01:50:39,100 --> 01:50:39,420
They...

2780
01:50:39,420 --> 01:50:39,940
They...

2781
01:50:40,280 --> 01:50:41,780
They destroyed it!

2782
01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:44,160
That should've been legal!

2783
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:49,420
They destroyed my car!

2784
01:50:50,240 --> 01:50:50,280
They destroyed my car!

2785
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:51,980
It's time for some road rage.

2786
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:53,660
This thing...

2787
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:56,380
They undo it!

2788
01:50:56,640 --> 01:50:58,460
Oh my god, I can't...

2789
01:50:58,460 --> 01:51:00,020
I have to restart that.

2790
01:51:02,360 --> 01:51:04,380
That's rough, buddy.

2791
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:07,280
That shouldn't be legal!

2792
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:11,220
What happened to my rights?

2793
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:14,500
Did he just do that?

2794
01:51:16,340 --> 01:51:17,720
Where's the dash cam?

2795
01:51:18,360 --> 01:51:19,180
Where's that?

2796
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:22,360
Release the dash cam footage!

2797
01:51:25,660 --> 01:51:26,800
Oh my god.

2798
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:28,980
Well, at least I don't have to care about getting arrested.

2799
01:51:28,980 --> 01:51:29,980
I have no money.

2800
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:32,160
Alright.

2801
01:51:36,180 --> 01:51:38,140
Look, it doesn't matter anymore.

2802
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:39,900
It doesn't matter.

2803
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,320
It doesn't matter.

2804
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:43,620
It doesn't matter.

2805
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:45,440
I don't have money.

2806
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:48,100
They're just gonna take pennies from me.

2807
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:51,580
I can't afford anything anymore.

2808
01:51:52,740 --> 01:51:55,420
Oh my god, that cop just like spawned in!

2809
01:51:56,260 --> 01:51:58,160
You almost hit a person!

2810
01:51:58,700 --> 01:51:59,280
Take that!

2811
01:51:59,600 --> 01:51:59,820
Okay.

2812
01:52:00,140 --> 01:52:00,360
Oops.

2813
01:52:01,260 --> 01:52:01,600
Alright.

2814
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:05,780
I'm gonna put this off the side of the road!

2815
01:52:06,040 --> 01:52:08,760
Like, as if they want me to run these people over!

2816
01:52:09,100 --> 01:52:10,220
Like, they're temptation!

2817
01:52:11,120 --> 01:52:12,000
Look at this!

2818
01:52:12,140 --> 01:52:13,300
God, I'm not strong enough.

2819
01:52:13,460 --> 01:52:14,020
God, please!

2820
01:52:14,420 --> 01:52:15,880
I'm not strong enough!

2821
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:18,000
I'm not your strongest warrior!

2822
01:52:18,660 --> 01:52:20,940
There's too many people here!

2823
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:30,120
You put these laser things literally in my path and you're expecting me to not run people over?

2824
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:33,400
What?

2825
01:52:35,540 --> 01:52:37,240
Are you fucking kidding me?

2826
01:52:37,580 --> 01:52:38,860
Are you- Okay, I'm fine.

2827
01:52:38,940 --> 01:52:39,220
I'm fine.

2828
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:39,660
I'm fine.

2829
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:40,120
I'm fine.

2830
01:52:41,540 --> 01:52:42,440
I'm fine.

2831
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:45,620
I'm so fine.

2832
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:49,940
Okay, my car's on fire again.

2833
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:50,740
Okay.

2834
01:52:51,780 --> 01:52:52,400
How-

2835
01:52:55,970 --> 01:52:57,410
I'm so sad.

2836
01:52:58,090 --> 01:53:02,810
I'm- It literally got on fire from the sheer impact.

2837
01:53:03,450 --> 01:53:04,090
It-

2838
01:53:07,470 --> 01:53:13,170
It caught on fire because of the impact of landing.

2839
01:53:13,570 --> 01:53:14,190
I-

2840
01:53:20,020 --> 01:53:20,660
Okay.

2841
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:26,480
I- This car just can't land.

2842
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:28,260
Don't have a cow, man.

2843
01:53:28,420 --> 01:53:30,220
This car is so fragile.

2844
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:33,400
Why do I have this- Oh my god.

2845
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:34,780
And then I miss.

2846
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:36,740
Why do I have this car?

2847
01:53:36,740 --> 01:53:46,500
Why do I have- Why do I have- Can that be my car?

2848
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:49,020
How was that car?

2849
01:53:49,820 --> 01:53:51,200
Oh my God.

2850
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:57,120
And then he puts me on the other side!

2851
01:53:57,820 --> 01:53:58,540
Okay.

2852
01:54:04,240 --> 01:54:05,400
Alright, that's okay.

2853
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:07,360
That's okay.

2854
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:07,400
Okay.

2855
01:54:07,940 --> 01:54:09,860
I repaired my car a little.

2856
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:12,760
Alright.

2857
01:54:14,020 --> 01:54:14,700
How?

2858
01:54:14,940 --> 01:54:20,080
How is this one lamppost stronger than a... than a billion... a billionaire's car?

2859
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:22,340
My car is owned by a billionaire.

2860
01:54:22,740 --> 01:54:24,400
It should not be worse.

2861
01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:28,160
Jesus.

2862
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:30,140
Where's the fucking physics?

2863
01:54:30,840 --> 01:54:31,300
Okay.

2864
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:33,120
God.

2865
01:54:34,780 --> 01:54:35,460
Alright.

2866
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:37,200
Okay, we're back here.

2867
01:54:39,740 --> 01:54:40,800
We're back here.

2868
01:54:41,700 --> 01:54:43,280
I swear this closes on me.

2869
01:54:43,340 --> 01:54:44,020
I swear to God.

2870
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:45,600
Alright.

2871
01:54:50,180 --> 01:54:52,920
If this impact... who?

2872
01:54:54,360 --> 01:54:55,780
Who did I run over?

2873
01:54:56,160 --> 01:54:59,830
Get out and finish the job.

2874
01:55:03,010 --> 01:55:05,830
Give me the name so I can finish the job.

2875
01:55:05,830 --> 01:55:08,930
Come, so there be no more witnesses.

2876
01:55:09,390 --> 01:55:12,830
I swear to God.

2877
01:55:15,930 --> 01:55:17,810
Are you serious?

2878
01:55:21,630 --> 01:55:24,230
I don't think we're making it, guys.

2879
01:55:24,690 --> 01:55:26,030
I have five seconds.

2880
01:55:29,150 --> 01:55:31,990
Even the game feels sad.

2881
01:55:32,610 --> 01:55:36,710
Even the game feels sad for me.

2882
01:55:36,710 --> 01:55:40,470
The game was like, okay, that's enough, Doki.

2883
01:55:41,030 --> 01:55:41,970
That's enough.

2884
01:55:42,170 --> 01:55:43,870
We know how this is gonna go.

2885
01:55:44,470 --> 01:55:47,630
We know where this is headed.

2886
01:55:48,130 --> 01:55:48,490
No!

2887
01:55:49,070 --> 01:55:50,050
Never give up!

2888
01:55:58,130 --> 01:56:00,530
Not the pity skin.

2889
01:56:01,870 --> 01:56:03,330
Alright, this is fine.

2890
01:56:04,030 --> 01:56:05,530
We figured it out.

2891
01:56:09,410 --> 01:56:09,970
Okay.

2892
01:56:09,970 --> 01:56:11,790
That's a tactical crash.

2893
01:56:12,750 --> 01:56:14,950
I need to stop my momentum there.

2894
01:56:15,210 --> 01:56:17,090
There's just too much momentum, you know?

2895
01:56:19,870 --> 01:56:22,250
Sometimes the momentum is just too much.

2896
01:56:24,190 --> 01:56:24,750
Alright.

2897
01:56:27,190 --> 01:56:28,250
Okay, here we go.

2898
01:56:29,810 --> 01:56:31,350
Oh my god, please.

2899
01:56:31,590 --> 01:56:32,530
It's time for some roses.

2900
01:56:32,530 --> 01:56:33,750
Please, the lamp!

2901
01:56:36,590 --> 01:56:37,430
Alright, nice.

2902
01:56:38,510 --> 01:56:39,830
Okay, and then...

2903
01:56:39,830 --> 01:56:41,950
I can't believe it!

2904
01:56:42,070 --> 01:56:43,090
Just arrest me!

2905
01:56:43,370 --> 01:56:44,950
Put me out of my misery!

2906
01:56:46,810 --> 01:56:47,710
Alright, nice.

2907
01:56:47,830 --> 01:56:48,190
That's fine.

2908
01:56:48,350 --> 01:56:48,790
That's fine.

2909
01:56:48,790 --> 01:56:50,010
We got...

2910
01:56:52,490 --> 01:56:53,650
We got...

2911
01:56:54,310 --> 01:56:56,050
Alright, we got this guy here.

2912
01:56:58,590 --> 01:56:59,710
I swear to god!

2913
01:56:59,930 --> 01:57:00,690
Mr. Burns, please!

2914
01:57:01,250 --> 01:57:02,310
Mr. Burns, please!

2915
01:57:04,250 --> 01:57:04,830
Mr.

2916
01:57:18,640 --> 01:57:20,200
Burns, please!

2917
01:57:21,200 --> 01:57:26,220
Why would he block the only pathway I have?

2918
01:57:26,980 --> 01:57:32,160
I don't understand his life doesn't close, Choke!

2919
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:35,300
I won't make it!

2920
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:38,100
I won't make it!

2921
01:57:39,380 --> 01:57:40,460
Unless...

2922
01:57:40,460 --> 01:57:41,520
I made it!

2923
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:42,920
Oh my god!

2924
01:57:43,320 --> 01:57:43,660
Never...

2925
01:57:43,660 --> 01:57:45,100
Never stop believing!

2926
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:47,680
Never stop believing!

2927
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:49,780
This sucks!

2928
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:52,420
You can make it!

2929
01:57:53,160 --> 01:57:54,480
Oh my god!

2930
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:55,280
Never give up!

2931
01:57:56,160 --> 01:57:57,800
This is gonna hurt.

2932
01:57:58,020 --> 01:57:59,740
Eat asphalt, asphalt eaters!

2933
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:02,960
Never give up!

2934
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:06,580
Still never give up!

2935
01:58:07,100 --> 01:58:08,820
It's still possible!

2936
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:12,820
Guys, I don't think it's possible, though, anymore.

2937
01:58:13,180 --> 01:58:17,200
I don't think...

2938
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:18,080
Okay.

2939
01:58:19,140 --> 01:58:20,660
It's all good.

2940
01:58:22,340 --> 01:58:23,440
Oh my god.

2941
01:58:24,140 --> 01:58:24,580
Oh my god.

2942
01:58:25,100 --> 01:58:25,880
Wait.

2943
01:58:26,340 --> 01:58:26,760
Wait.

2944
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:27,800
Please.

2945
01:58:28,140 --> 01:58:28,700
Please.

2946
01:58:29,100 --> 01:58:29,620
Please.

2947
01:58:30,240 --> 01:58:30,620
No!

2948
01:58:30,620 --> 01:58:31,500
Oh, yes!

2949
01:58:31,860 --> 01:58:32,380
Cross it!

2950
01:58:38,240 --> 01:58:38,940
It's okay.

2951
01:58:39,180 --> 01:58:39,860
We made it!

2952
01:58:40,220 --> 01:58:40,980
We made it!

2953
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:45,460
God, I wanted him to let me win.

2954
01:58:45,700 --> 01:58:46,320
I made it.

2955
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:47,060
Don't keep it.

2956
01:58:47,560 --> 01:58:47,880
Absolutely.

2957
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:49,440
Thank you for the super chat.

2958
01:58:49,700 --> 01:58:49,960
Thank you.

2959
01:58:50,100 --> 01:58:50,600
Thank you.

2960
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:51,740
Oh my god!

2961
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:53,000
I actually made it!

2962
01:58:53,640 --> 01:58:54,620
Oh my god!

2963
01:58:54,860 --> 01:58:56,380
I didn't save my game!

2964
01:58:57,140 --> 01:58:57,540
Okay.

2965
01:58:58,860 --> 01:58:59,720
We made it.

2966
01:58:59,820 --> 01:59:00,300
We made it.

2967
01:59:00,440 --> 01:59:01,260
Oh my god.

2968
01:59:01,320 --> 01:59:02,300
We actually did it.

2969
01:59:02,600 --> 01:59:04,440
We might have got the pity skip.

2970
01:59:04,440 --> 01:59:05,600
But we did.

2971
01:59:05,700 --> 01:59:06,880
We persevered.

2972
01:59:07,080 --> 01:59:08,640
We didn't let no pity.

2973
01:59:08,820 --> 01:59:10,100
We didn't go to the pity.

2974
01:59:10,820 --> 01:59:11,280
Guys.

2975
01:59:11,720 --> 01:59:12,760
Never give up.

2976
01:59:12,840 --> 01:59:14,240
I didn't play so many video games.

2977
01:59:14,380 --> 01:59:15,100
I'd be in better shape.

2978
01:59:15,400 --> 01:59:16,200
Never give up.

2979
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:19,200
I'm broke.

2980
01:59:19,460 --> 01:59:20,000
But I'm a...

2981
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,800
Guys, I don't think we're gonna be able to afford El Bardo.

2982
01:59:23,240 --> 01:59:23,540
I know.

2983
01:59:24,460 --> 01:59:24,920
Guys.

2984
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:27,200
I have a feeling that...

2985
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:29,620
We might not be able to afford that...

2986
01:59:29,620 --> 01:59:30,420
That costume.

2987
01:59:34,740 --> 01:59:35,260
Alright.

2988
01:59:35,380 --> 01:59:36,140
We go this way.

2989
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:38,440
And then...

2990
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:39,680
We gotta find a wrench soon.

2991
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:41,100
My car ain't doing so well.

2992
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:44,720
Alright.

2993
01:59:45,980 --> 01:59:47,020
I'm following.

2994
01:59:47,780 --> 01:59:48,000
I'm following.

2995
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:49,880
Where the fuck are all the wrenches?

2996
01:59:52,380 --> 01:59:56,740
How there's an infinite money glitch that can help with that?

2997
01:59:57,600 --> 01:59:57,960
Man.

2998
01:59:58,100 --> 01:59:59,380
I wish I knew where...

2999
01:59:59,380 --> 02:00:00,180
I wish...

3000
02:00:00,180 --> 02:00:00,640
Man.

3001
02:00:00,920 --> 02:00:02,800
I wonder where that could be.

3002
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:04,040
Hmm.

3003
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:04,140
Hmm.

3004
02:00:10,460 --> 02:00:12,720
Yeah, we need to get like a wrench somewhere.

3005
02:00:13,260 --> 02:00:14,080
Oh yeah, baby.

3006
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:14,480
Don't worry.

3007
02:00:14,580 --> 02:00:16,420
My car could take a couple of more hits.

3008
02:00:16,700 --> 02:00:19,080
We just might not be able to see the road a little.

3009
02:00:19,340 --> 02:00:20,100
But that's normal.

3010
02:00:20,620 --> 02:00:22,060
Everyone has to go through that.

3011
02:00:22,300 --> 02:00:25,840
Everyone has to go through that every once in a while.

3012
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:26,240
You know?

3013
02:00:26,420 --> 02:00:28,120
You know when your car just starts smoking?

3014
02:00:29,380 --> 02:00:30,320
That's just life.

3015
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:33,000
Hey, homie.

3016
02:00:34,040 --> 02:00:35,280
Alright, let's see if like...

3017
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:36,300
Let's see if there's a wrench nearby.

3018
02:00:36,300 --> 02:00:37,620
I don't think...

3019
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:39,160
We might need a wrench.

3020
02:00:42,140 --> 02:00:42,660
Alright.

3021
02:00:45,660 --> 02:00:46,520
Hello, homie.

3022
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:49,460
Dad, the aliens have taken over the Duff Brewery.

3023
02:00:49,460 --> 02:00:51,160
And they're using it to store laser guns.

3024
02:00:51,740 --> 02:00:55,140
Oh god, never in my life I've ever had to do so much explaining.

3025
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:55,820
What?

3026
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:59,340
This is Duff's worst disgrace since Duff Ice.

3027
02:00:59,640 --> 02:01:02,080
It's time to use my secret weapon.

3028
02:01:02,420 --> 02:01:06,100
Remember when I told you I sold my old car so you could go to college?

3029
02:01:06,100 --> 02:01:06,720
Yeah?

3030
02:01:08,420 --> 02:01:08,760
Yeah?

3031
02:01:08,900 --> 02:01:09,180
Yeah?

3032
02:01:09,640 --> 02:01:10,460
Tough luck, Swarthmore.

3033
02:01:11,720 --> 02:01:13,360
Parents lying to you?

3034
02:01:13,460 --> 02:01:15,480
Oh man, saying so.

3035
02:01:16,740 --> 02:01:19,580
Reach to the Brewery before the aliens escape.

3036
02:01:20,080 --> 02:01:20,660
No way!

3037
02:01:21,900 --> 02:01:23,260
You got it.

3038
02:01:23,940 --> 02:01:24,340
Okay.

3039
02:01:24,860 --> 02:01:25,260
Oh my god.

3040
02:01:25,380 --> 02:01:26,360
No, not another race.

3041
02:01:26,580 --> 02:01:27,520
No, not again.

3042
02:01:28,020 --> 02:01:28,860
No, not again.

3043
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:30,280
And he knows the shortcut.

3044
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:31,140
He's cheating!

3045
02:01:32,300 --> 02:01:32,960
Oh my god.

3046
02:01:33,080 --> 02:01:34,080
I missed the other shortcut.

3047
02:01:34,340 --> 02:01:35,340
Oh my god.

3048
02:01:35,460 --> 02:01:36,460
I missed the other shortcut.

3049
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:39,900
Oh no.

3050
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:40,560
Oh no.

3051
02:01:41,380 --> 02:01:42,640
Oh, Homer.

3052
02:01:42,860 --> 02:01:45,320
Why is your car so fucking shit?

3053
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:46,800
You're supposed to eat my dust.

3054
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:47,640
Stay on target.

3055
02:01:47,780 --> 02:01:48,700
Stay on target.

3056
02:01:49,320 --> 02:01:50,880
Oh man, your car sucks!

3057
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:52,780
People say I'm slow.

3058
02:01:53,340 --> 02:01:53,740
Wait a minute.

3059
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:55,040
That's an insult.

3060
02:01:55,440 --> 02:01:56,660
Save me, Jeebus!

3061
02:01:58,540 --> 02:01:59,540
Oh man.

3062
02:02:00,280 --> 02:02:00,880
Why?

3063
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:01,460
Why?

3064
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:05,380
Why does your car suck, Kobe?

3065
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:07,900
There was a shortcut there?

3066
02:02:10,160 --> 02:02:10,640
Why?

3067
02:02:10,940 --> 02:02:11,660
Why did I...

3068
02:02:11,660 --> 02:02:12,280
Oh my god.

3069
02:02:12,460 --> 02:02:14,080
And the cops are going to join the race too.

3070
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:16,140
The cops are going to join this race.

3071
02:02:19,340 --> 02:02:20,580
Oh no...

3072
02:02:20,580 --> 02:02:21,420
Oh no.

3073
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:22,460
Oh no, it's right there.

3074
02:02:22,860 --> 02:02:23,920
Oh, I just made it!

3075
02:02:24,040 --> 02:02:24,600
I just made it!

3076
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:25,140
I just made it!

3077
02:02:25,780 --> 02:02:26,480
That's right!

3078
02:02:26,680 --> 02:02:27,160
Fuck you!

3079
02:02:31,860 --> 02:02:34,640
I just found the shortcut too.

3080
02:02:36,620 --> 02:02:38,700
The lasers were only the beginning.

3081
02:02:39,080 --> 02:02:43,720
Even now, our all-purpose evil cola is spreading underground through your water supply.

3082
02:02:44,100 --> 02:02:45,380
It will wake the dead.

3083
02:02:45,880 --> 02:02:48,820
Zombies will rise from the day that you are the living.

3084
02:02:49,060 --> 02:02:50,840
And our ratings will rise.

3085
02:02:51,080 --> 02:02:55,580
Rise to levels unseen since the heyday of evening shade.

3086
02:03:00,580 --> 02:03:01,640
What's the plot anymore?

3087
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:02,660
The Simpsons.

3088
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:05,520
I mean, oh no, I hope their plan fails.

3089
02:03:06,300 --> 02:03:07,120
Who am I kidding?

3090
02:03:07,320 --> 02:03:08,180
Zombies eating brains?

3091
02:03:08,340 --> 02:03:09,540
Oh, this is gonna rot.

3092
02:03:09,640 --> 02:03:10,760
Oh my god, that's so cool.

3093
02:03:10,820 --> 02:03:12,100
As long as it doesn't happen to me.

3094
02:03:14,380 --> 02:03:17,740
Oh, 27.5%.

3095
02:03:20,520 --> 02:03:22,160
Yeah, that sounds right.

3096
02:03:23,460 --> 02:03:24,860
That sounds right, guys.

3097
02:03:29,190 --> 02:03:29,710
Alright.

3098
02:03:30,490 --> 02:03:32,230
Wait, how many missions do I have left?

3099
02:03:36,940 --> 02:03:38,200
Is this the last chapter?

3100
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:39,640
Oh, we can finish it today!

3101
02:03:39,960 --> 02:03:41,340
Wait, let's finish this game today.

3102
02:03:41,700 --> 02:03:43,680
Might as well, if it's the last chapter.

3103
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:45,600
Oh, it's Halloween!

3104
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:48,520
Spooky, scary skeleton.

3105
02:03:50,620 --> 02:03:53,400
Dad, the zombies are on the way!

3106
02:03:53,740 --> 02:03:54,860
Shouldn't we do something?

3107
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:56,060
No, no, Lisa.

3108
02:03:56,320 --> 02:03:57,900
I'm trying to listen to the baseball game.

3109
02:03:58,400 --> 02:03:59,840
It's the top of the seventh and...

3110
02:04:00,340 --> 02:04:00,840
Oh god!

3111
02:04:01,300 --> 02:04:01,820
Zombies!

3112
02:04:01,980 --> 02:04:02,880
They're devouring the...

3113
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:09,220
Nice!

3114
02:04:09,620 --> 02:04:10,340
Oh, alright.

3115
02:04:10,640 --> 02:04:12,400
Now get us some survival supplies.

3116
02:04:12,680 --> 02:04:15,000
Stupid Brockman getting eaten by zombies.

3117
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:15,660
I know, right?

3118
02:04:16,200 --> 02:04:17,520
Stupid news reporter.

3119
02:04:18,300 --> 02:04:20,080
Benok, don't let time run out.

3120
02:04:20,480 --> 02:04:21,060
It's crashing time!

3121
02:04:21,380 --> 02:04:22,520
Alright, what car is it?

3122
02:04:24,520 --> 02:04:26,220
Okay, the last missions are hard.

3123
02:04:26,420 --> 02:04:26,660
Okay.

3124
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:27,180
Oh!

3125
02:04:27,700 --> 02:04:29,480
Wait, is that a zombie?

3126
02:04:29,720 --> 02:04:30,880
Are you a zombie?

3127
02:04:32,480 --> 02:04:33,520
Wait, it's...

3128
02:04:33,520 --> 02:04:35,000
Wait, what is he?

3129
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:36,320
Oh, that's so cool!

3130
02:04:36,380 --> 02:04:37,200
There's witches!

3131
02:04:38,580 --> 02:04:39,620
And skeletons!

3132
02:04:42,020 --> 02:04:42,880
Oh my god!

3133
02:04:43,020 --> 02:04:44,380
Wait, can I steal your witch broom?

3134
02:04:45,220 --> 02:04:45,800
Get out!

3135
02:04:46,340 --> 02:04:47,560
I want to be on a witch broom.

3136
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:48,320
Oh shit!

3137
02:04:48,360 --> 02:04:49,760
I forgot to talk to Flanders!

3138
02:04:50,020 --> 02:04:51,400
I saw a witch!

3139
02:04:51,700 --> 02:04:52,700
Hello, Flanders!

3140
02:04:58,140 --> 02:05:00,100
Sorry, I was looking at...

3141
02:05:00,100 --> 02:05:01,440
I was exploring.

3142
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:01,660
Sweet!

3143
02:05:02,580 --> 02:05:04,180
I was looking at the witch.

3144
02:05:04,460 --> 02:05:05,640
I was like, Whoa!

3145
02:05:06,040 --> 02:05:06,220
Witch!

3146
02:05:07,080 --> 02:05:07,960
Ha ha ha!

3147
02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:10,300
Flanders, give me your first aid kit.

3148
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:11,520
Well, I was...

3149
02:05:11,520 --> 02:05:13,840
Hoping to save it for Rotter and Totter to...

3150
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:15,720
You know, bandage their brain-eater boo-boos.

3151
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:17,520
Look, just rub a Bible on them.

3152
02:05:17,680 --> 02:05:19,080
Will that work to fend off zombies?

3153
02:05:19,360 --> 02:05:19,800
Yeah!

3154
02:05:20,760 --> 02:05:21,800
In holy water, right?

3155
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:23,000
Here's the first aid kit.

3156
02:05:23,060 --> 02:05:25,800
Daddy, if the zombies are dead...

3157
02:05:25,800 --> 02:05:30,160
Why are you asking me to feed the poor hungry zombie?

3158
02:05:31,940 --> 02:05:32,380
Alright.

3159
02:05:32,680 --> 02:05:33,840
We got the first aid kit.

3160
02:05:34,020 --> 02:05:34,520
We did it.

3161
02:05:35,340 --> 02:05:36,760
Drive to Cletus's house.

3162
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:37,220
I know!

3163
02:05:37,660 --> 02:05:38,100
Boards!

3164
02:05:38,680 --> 02:05:39,760
Where's my car?

3165
02:05:40,280 --> 02:05:41,100
Dude, where's my car?

3166
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:42,340
Wait, is that my car?

3167
02:05:43,380 --> 02:05:45,040
Is that supposed to be my car?

3168
02:05:45,120 --> 02:05:46,240
Why is it parked there?

3169
02:05:46,360 --> 02:05:47,640
Oh my god, that's so funny.

3170
02:05:48,220 --> 02:05:49,360
That's actually so silly.

3171
02:05:49,860 --> 02:05:51,040
I'm gonna drift with my broom.

3172
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:51,120
Broom.

3173
02:05:53,940 --> 02:05:55,100
Broom drifting.

3174
02:05:55,860 --> 02:05:56,400
Let's go.

3175
02:05:58,280 --> 02:05:59,740
But now, broom drift.

3176
02:06:00,040 --> 02:06:01,800
Jesus Christ, it's so clunky.

3177
02:06:02,140 --> 02:06:03,580
I'm gonna tell you guys right now.

3178
02:06:03,920 --> 02:06:06,480
This broom is so fucking clunky.

3179
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:07,900
I don't...

3180
02:06:07,900 --> 02:06:09,400
Oh my god.

3181
02:06:11,750 --> 02:06:12,700
How do I...

3182
02:06:12,700 --> 02:06:13,420
Oh my god.

3183
02:06:13,740 --> 02:06:14,100
I...

3184
02:06:15,340 --> 02:06:16,140
That's actually...

3185
02:06:16,140 --> 02:06:17,220
Let's do this thing!

3186
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:19,600
That's actually so difficult.

3187
02:06:19,600 --> 02:06:20,820
No pagans.

3188
02:06:22,340 --> 02:06:22,540
Ouch!

3189
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:23,260
My...

3190
02:06:23,260 --> 02:06:23,820
Give me your...

3191
02:06:24,360 --> 02:06:24,640
Okay.

3192
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:26,260
Let's see.

3193
02:06:26,420 --> 02:06:27,820
I need something to board up the window.

3194
02:06:27,860 --> 02:06:29,420
We gotta grab another car.

3195
02:06:29,420 --> 02:06:30,120
I can't.

3196
02:06:30,680 --> 02:06:31,340
I can't.

3197
02:06:31,380 --> 02:06:31,600
Chest pain!

3198
02:06:32,040 --> 02:06:32,940
I mean chest pain!

3199
02:06:33,100 --> 02:06:34,340
I can't do that.

3200
02:06:34,740 --> 02:06:36,040
You know what to do.

3201
02:06:36,500 --> 02:06:36,760
Can you do it with me?

3202
02:06:36,760 --> 02:06:37,600
This is the car.

3203
02:06:40,820 --> 02:06:42,720
I cannot drive the broom.

3204
02:06:43,060 --> 02:06:44,280
Let's do this thing!

3205
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:46,480
The broom is too much.

3206
02:06:47,860 --> 02:06:49,480
I can drive through the graveyard?

3207
02:06:50,020 --> 02:06:51,860
Wait, is the graveyard like a shortcut?

3208
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:54,080
It is!

3209
02:06:54,540 --> 02:06:55,660
I didn't know that.

3210
02:06:56,660 --> 02:06:57,360
Oh my god.

3211
02:06:57,560 --> 02:06:57,980
Shortcut!

3212
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:01,660
Okay, I'm still not...

3213
02:07:01,660 --> 02:07:02,240
Boy, I can make it.

3214
02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:02,780
I can make it.

3215
02:07:04,060 --> 02:07:04,480
Nice.

3216
02:07:04,480 --> 02:07:05,880
Hey, come back here.

3217
02:07:06,080 --> 02:07:07,200
Dems are sleeping on board.

3218
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:09,040
Wait, I have to drive to a different area?

3219
02:07:09,440 --> 02:07:12,460
Guess I'll have to use a heart for a pillow now.

3220
02:07:12,540 --> 02:07:12,780
No!

3221
02:07:13,240 --> 02:07:13,640
No!

3222
02:07:13,780 --> 02:07:15,200
No, I don't know where Mo's place is!

3223
02:07:16,600 --> 02:07:17,800
Mo, where do you live?

3224
02:07:18,860 --> 02:07:19,400
Oh, there.

3225
02:07:19,620 --> 02:07:20,380
You're driving.

3226
02:07:20,380 --> 02:07:21,040
Okay, there you go.

3227
02:07:22,720 --> 02:07:23,000
Alright.

3228
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:23,620
Oh my god.

3229
02:07:23,680 --> 02:07:24,940
I almost left fucked up.

3230
02:07:25,640 --> 02:07:26,400
Alright, let's go.

3231
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:27,400
Oh wait, what's this?

3232
02:07:30,760 --> 02:07:33,200
I ain't opening it unless you have a warrant.

3233
02:07:35,540 --> 02:07:36,320
Hedgehog, welcome!

3234
02:07:36,700 --> 02:07:37,340
Thank you for the rain!

3235
02:07:37,480 --> 02:07:38,360
Thank you, thank you!

3236
02:07:38,500 --> 02:07:40,400
Okay, let's grab this screwdriver real quick.

3237
02:07:42,380 --> 02:07:43,680
Don't worry, Nelson.

3238
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:44,560
I'm friendly.

3239
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:47,720
Just come outside.

3240
02:07:49,340 --> 02:07:50,460
Your dad's back.

3241
02:07:52,880 --> 02:07:54,080
Look, I told you.

3242
02:07:54,180 --> 02:07:55,400
I'm already saved.

3243
02:07:58,360 --> 02:08:00,380
Papa, have you come back?

3244
02:08:01,580 --> 02:08:03,620
Papa, can you hear me?

3245
02:08:04,640 --> 02:08:06,860
Papa, I don't know.

3246
02:08:07,560 --> 02:08:08,820
That's so sad though.

3247
02:08:09,260 --> 02:08:11,220
They retconned that shit so many times.

3248
02:08:11,700 --> 02:08:13,020
They were like, oh yeah.

3249
02:08:13,760 --> 02:08:16,500
Nelson's dad ran away because he had a peanut allergy.

3250
02:08:16,820 --> 02:08:18,680
And then he got kidnapped to the circus.

3251
02:08:18,940 --> 02:08:19,620
I'm like, what?

3252
02:08:20,980 --> 02:08:21,500
Like...

3253
02:08:21,500 --> 02:08:22,000
God.

3254
02:08:23,100 --> 02:08:23,620
What?

3255
02:08:25,340 --> 02:08:26,820
That's like one of the stories.

3256
02:08:26,820 --> 02:08:30,360
But they like retconned it so much that I don't even know which one's the...

3257
02:08:30,360 --> 02:08:32,220
Which one's the real story now.

3258
02:08:33,140 --> 02:08:34,380
How the fuck do I get up there?

3259
02:08:38,180 --> 02:08:38,660
Yeah.

3260
02:08:39,160 --> 02:08:41,440
Nelson has a quote-unquote deadbeat dad.

3261
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:43,000
Who went out for cigarettes.

3262
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:44,880
Like he literally went out for cigarettes.

3263
02:08:45,080 --> 02:08:45,620
And milk.

3264
02:08:48,720 --> 02:08:50,400
And then, cause he was like...

3265
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:51,560
I'm gonna go get some cig...

3266
02:08:51,560 --> 02:08:53,400
I'm gonna go get some cigarettes and milk, Nelson.

3267
02:08:53,780 --> 02:08:55,460
And then he got a peanut allergy.

3268
02:08:55,760 --> 02:08:57,680
And then like the circus kidnapped him.

3269
02:08:59,540 --> 02:09:00,640
And that's why like...

3270
02:09:01,960 --> 02:09:04,040
Guys, I don't know what happened to my groceries.

3271
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:06,460
Guys, remember when...

3272
02:09:06,460 --> 02:09:08,980
When I'm supposed to...

3273
02:09:08,980 --> 02:09:09,580
When I'm supposed to...

3274
02:09:09,580 --> 02:09:10,560
Have my groceries delivered?

3275
02:09:11,140 --> 02:09:12,600
Did I miss the call?

3276
02:09:12,980 --> 02:09:13,380
Did I?

3277
02:09:16,760 --> 02:09:18,600
Wow, I need a disco hat.

3278
02:09:20,720 --> 02:09:21,460
Oh no.

3279
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:24,720
It's alright.

3280
02:09:27,980 --> 02:09:30,060
Maybe I'll get it tomorrow.

3281
02:09:30,720 --> 02:09:31,180
Maybe.

3282
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:35,660
Alright, we'll just walk back.

3283
02:09:35,880 --> 02:09:36,960
Oh my god, there's a boat!

3284
02:09:37,960 --> 02:09:38,700
I love...

3285
02:09:38,700 --> 02:09:40,420
I love like the reskin for every...

3286
02:09:40,420 --> 02:09:41,920
I love the Halloween reskin.

3287
02:09:44,860 --> 02:09:45,320
Hello.

3288
02:09:45,980 --> 02:09:48,940
Moe, I need your chainsaw to chop up attacking zombies.

3289
02:09:49,140 --> 02:09:50,560
But then how will I defend myself?

3290
02:09:50,860 --> 02:09:51,900
Moe, Moe, Moe.

3291
02:09:52,080 --> 02:09:54,700
Shouldn't the weapons go to save people who have loved ones?

3292
02:09:54,700 --> 02:09:55,580
Yeah.

3293
02:09:56,240 --> 02:09:56,860
That's so true.

3294
02:09:57,500 --> 02:09:57,660
Yeah, I guess so.

3295
02:09:57,660 --> 02:09:58,820
You're not married yet.

3296
02:09:59,640 --> 02:10:00,200
Well...

3297
02:10:00,200 --> 02:10:00,440
Better go home.

3298
02:10:00,440 --> 02:10:02,340
Those who don't know, Moe is engaged.

3299
02:10:03,040 --> 02:10:04,440
To a little person.

3300
02:10:07,500 --> 02:10:08,060
Yay!

3301
02:10:09,040 --> 02:10:10,000
Wait, drive back home?

3302
02:10:10,440 --> 02:10:10,760
Well, it's about time.

3303
02:10:11,560 --> 02:10:12,780
But like, they don't...

3304
02:10:12,780 --> 02:10:15,420
But like, they stopped with the plot for some reason.

3305
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:19,660
They like, introduced a plot of how he's like, in love and engaged.

3306
02:10:20,120 --> 02:10:21,720
And then they like, stopped...

3307
02:10:22,240 --> 02:10:23,060
I am evil Homer.

3308
02:10:23,060 --> 02:10:24,680
I am evil Homer.

3309
02:10:24,680 --> 02:10:25,640
I don't think anything with it.

3310
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:26,520
But...

3311
02:10:27,260 --> 02:10:27,940
Like...

3312
02:10:27,940 --> 02:10:29,100
The story just...

3313
02:10:29,100 --> 02:10:29,680
I don't know.

3314
02:10:30,060 --> 02:10:31,880
It's like it never existed.

3315
02:10:33,180 --> 02:10:34,540
For some reason.

3316
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:38,620
They just forgot about that storyline that they wrote.

3317
02:10:40,900 --> 02:10:41,580
Yay!

3318
02:10:46,220 --> 02:10:48,140
Wait, I have another mission?

3319
02:10:48,140 --> 02:10:49,060
Oh wait, okay.

3320
02:10:49,180 --> 02:10:50,240
Before I go to another mission.

3321
02:10:50,380 --> 02:10:51,300
I want some money.

3322
02:10:55,210 --> 02:10:55,670
Yay!

3323
02:10:56,490 --> 02:10:56,590
Oh.

3324
02:10:57,070 --> 02:10:57,450
Whoops.

3325
02:10:59,330 --> 02:10:59,990
Not my fault.

3326
02:11:02,810 --> 02:11:03,270
Okay.

3327
02:11:03,850 --> 02:11:04,750
Get over here.

3328
02:11:05,270 --> 02:11:06,370
Get over here, bee.

3329
02:11:09,030 --> 02:11:09,490
Yay!

3330
02:11:09,650 --> 02:11:10,930
All the money I'm gonna lose.

3331
02:11:11,230 --> 02:11:11,910
From the cops.

3332
02:11:11,910 --> 02:11:12,330
The cops.

3333
02:11:12,490 --> 02:11:12,970
Yippee!

3334
02:11:18,540 --> 02:11:19,920
Wait, is this the apocalypse?

3335
02:11:20,700 --> 02:11:22,140
We're in the apocalypse now.

3336
02:11:22,580 --> 02:11:23,420
I swear to god.

3337
02:11:23,540 --> 02:11:24,100
If you fucking...

3338
02:11:24,100 --> 02:11:24,620
I swear to god.

3339
02:11:24,780 --> 02:11:25,100
I...

3340
02:11:25,100 --> 02:11:25,260
Okay.

3341
02:11:29,120 --> 02:11:29,600
Alright.

3342
02:11:31,600 --> 02:11:32,760
Let me destroy these.

3343
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:34,280
No infinite money glitch here.

3344
02:11:35,200 --> 02:11:35,860
That's right.

3345
02:11:36,020 --> 02:11:37,360
Those are for pussies!

3346
02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:38,900
I ain't no pussy.

3347
02:11:38,900 --> 02:11:41,700
I saw a skip button and I still kept playing.

3348
02:11:42,200 --> 02:11:43,320
Never give up.

3349
02:11:44,980 --> 02:11:45,340
Alright.

3350
02:11:45,520 --> 02:11:46,040
Let's see.

3351
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:47,180
Why should I get that card?

3352
02:11:50,120 --> 02:11:50,720
Oh.

3353
02:11:51,380 --> 02:11:51,820
Oh.

3354
02:11:54,500 --> 02:11:56,060
Where is this card?

3355
02:11:56,620 --> 02:11:57,600
Okay, there we go.

3356
02:11:58,240 --> 02:11:58,740
There we go.

3357
02:12:00,180 --> 02:12:01,740
Is Bart in his room?

3358
02:12:02,440 --> 02:12:02,880
Bart.

3359
02:12:03,640 --> 02:12:04,720
As your dad.

3360
02:12:05,040 --> 02:12:06,500
I'm not gonna respect you.

3361
02:12:07,880 --> 02:12:09,180
And come right in.

3362
02:12:09,940 --> 02:12:10,900
Holy fuck!

3363
02:12:11,180 --> 02:12:12,000
Oh my god!

3364
02:12:12,260 --> 02:12:13,460
Okay, that actually scared me.

3365
02:12:13,960 --> 02:12:14,320
That...

3366
02:12:15,640 --> 02:12:17,140
Oh my god, they have...

3367
02:12:17,140 --> 02:12:19,620
Oh, at each level it has its own costume!

3368
02:12:23,480 --> 02:12:25,340
Oh, I wanna be the forbidden donut.

3369
02:12:25,620 --> 02:12:26,620
Oh, that's so much money.

3370
02:12:26,760 --> 02:12:27,520
Wait, I wanna be...

3371
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:28,820
I wanna be...

3372
02:12:28,820 --> 02:12:30,540
I wanna be the forbidden donut.

3373
02:12:30,780 --> 02:12:31,060
Mmm.

3374
02:12:32,140 --> 02:12:33,100
Forbidden donut.

3375
02:12:38,200 --> 02:12:38,960
Alright, let's...

3376
02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:40,540
Roku, thank you for the super chat.

3377
02:12:40,660 --> 02:12:40,880
Thank you.

3378
02:12:41,020 --> 02:12:41,520
Thank you.

3379
02:12:41,780 --> 02:12:42,440
Hi, Doki.

3380
02:12:42,700 --> 02:12:44,620
It's my friend's birthday today.

3381
02:12:44,840 --> 02:12:47,040
He sometimes watches your VOD and would like to...

3382
02:12:47,040 --> 02:12:47,620
Wait, let me see.

3383
02:12:47,700 --> 02:12:48,020
Give me a sec.

3384
02:12:48,120 --> 02:12:48,620
Let me be up this view.

3385
02:12:49,220 --> 02:12:49,320
Okay.

3386
02:12:49,540 --> 02:12:52,780
And he sometimes watches your VOD and like to ask if you get a birthday song.

3387
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:53,300
Of course!

3388
02:12:53,680 --> 02:12:55,880
His internet alias is Pepsi Man.

3389
02:12:55,880 --> 02:12:58,240
Happy birthday to you.

3390
02:12:58,460 --> 02:13:00,400
Happy birthday to you.

3391
02:13:00,660 --> 02:13:02,900
Happy birthday, dear Pepsi Man.

3392
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:05,320
Happy birthday to you.

3393
02:13:05,540 --> 02:13:05,940
Yeah!

3394
02:13:06,300 --> 02:13:06,900
Happy birthday!

3395
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:08,080
Yeah!

3396
02:13:09,680 --> 02:13:11,000
Alright, let's...

3397
02:13:11,440 --> 02:13:13,140
Get all these coins.

3398
02:13:13,420 --> 02:13:14,080
It's like five...

3399
02:13:14,080 --> 02:13:15,560
Was it $500, guys?

3400
02:13:16,620 --> 02:13:17,060
For...

3401
02:13:17,060 --> 02:13:17,760
Uh...

3402
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:18,060
Wow!

3403
02:13:18,260 --> 02:13:19,540
I need a disco nap.

3404
02:13:20,020 --> 02:13:21,560
It's $500, right?

3405
02:13:25,550 --> 02:13:26,610
What the fuck?

3406
02:13:27,550 --> 02:13:28,510
Who said that?

3407
02:13:30,410 --> 02:13:30,770
Oh!

3408
02:13:30,930 --> 02:13:31,110
Oh!

3409
02:13:31,230 --> 02:13:31,350
No!

3410
02:13:31,510 --> 02:13:31,770
No!

3411
02:13:32,350 --> 02:13:32,550
No!

3412
02:13:32,650 --> 02:13:32,690
No!

3413
02:13:33,330 --> 02:13:33,890
No!

3414
02:13:33,890 --> 02:13:33,930
No!

3415
02:13:33,930 --> 02:13:33,990
No!

3416
02:13:33,990 --> 02:13:34,030
No!

3417
02:13:34,030 --> 02:13:34,050
No!

3418
02:13:34,050 --> 02:13:34,190
No!

3419
02:13:34,190 --> 02:13:34,630
No!

3420
02:13:36,370 --> 02:13:36,930
No!

3421
02:13:36,930 --> 02:13:37,890
Are you kidding me?!

3422
02:13:37,890 --> 02:13:38,910
That's it.

3423
02:13:39,030 --> 02:13:39,490
I'm angry.

3424
02:13:39,990 --> 02:13:40,750
That's it!

3425
02:13:41,150 --> 02:13:41,890
That's it!

3426
02:13:42,130 --> 02:13:42,810
Get over here!

3427
02:13:43,550 --> 02:13:44,110
Okay.

3428
02:13:46,670 --> 02:13:46,970
Okay.

3429
02:13:47,230 --> 02:13:48,230
You still have...

3430
02:13:48,230 --> 02:13:49,890
You didn't fuck me up too much.

3431
02:13:55,250 --> 02:13:55,850
Jesus.

3432
02:13:56,170 --> 02:13:56,370
Who...

3433
02:13:56,370 --> 02:13:58,650
Where's that like ominous sound coming from?

3434
02:14:02,050 --> 02:14:03,150
Okay, I give up.

3435
02:14:04,430 --> 02:14:05,510
You can...

3436
02:14:05,510 --> 02:14:07,170
You can have that.

3437
02:14:07,170 --> 02:14:08,250
Go crazy.

3438
02:14:08,690 --> 02:14:09,590
Go crazy.

3439
02:14:09,910 --> 02:14:10,110
Go crazy.

3440
02:14:10,110 --> 02:14:11,250
Make Homer go crazy.

3441
02:14:11,830 --> 02:14:12,470
No TV.

3442
02:14:12,770 --> 02:14:13,090
Go crazy.

3443
02:14:13,450 --> 02:14:14,690
Make Homer go crazy.

3444
02:14:14,810 --> 02:14:16,090
You think Homer is okay?

3445
02:14:17,670 --> 02:14:19,890
Do you think he's okay, guys?

3446
02:14:21,490 --> 02:14:23,390
No, I tried going up the slide.

3447
02:14:23,430 --> 02:14:24,250
It won't let me.

3448
02:14:25,350 --> 02:14:26,190
Fuck you guys!

3449
02:14:26,870 --> 02:14:27,610
That's right.

3450
02:14:27,750 --> 02:14:29,250
Get a real job, zombies!

3451
02:14:30,590 --> 02:14:31,870
Fucking freeloaders.

3452
02:14:32,230 --> 02:14:34,050
Why is Bumblebee mad?

3453
02:14:34,310 --> 02:14:35,290
Oh my god!

3454
02:14:35,630 --> 02:14:36,890
That's so funny!

3455
02:14:37,830 --> 02:14:39,270
Why is Bumblebee mad?

3456
02:14:39,490 --> 02:14:40,030
Like not...

3457
02:14:40,490 --> 02:14:41,830
Just a normal guy.

3458
02:14:44,450 --> 02:14:45,490
That's right.

3459
02:14:46,070 --> 02:14:46,830
Zombies.

3460
02:14:47,150 --> 02:14:48,390
Don't deserve anything.

3461
02:14:49,750 --> 02:14:50,910
They're dead!

3462
02:14:51,390 --> 02:14:52,790
The dead have no rights.

3463
02:14:53,690 --> 02:14:55,790
That's what being dead means.

3464
02:15:00,690 --> 02:15:02,210
Oh wait, I want this.

3465
02:15:06,410 --> 02:15:07,310
Alright.

3466
02:15:07,750 --> 02:15:08,830
We're almost there.

3467
02:15:09,070 --> 02:15:10,790
We can almost be the forbidden donut.

3468
02:15:14,440 --> 02:15:14,890
Okay.

3469
02:15:16,390 --> 02:15:17,050
Hello?

3470
02:15:18,550 --> 02:15:19,450
Nice.

3471
02:15:19,450 --> 02:15:20,850
Press means press right away.

3472
02:15:22,150 --> 02:15:23,050
Bouncy bouncy!

3473
02:15:23,350 --> 02:15:25,090
Has to be more money here.

3474
02:15:25,870 --> 02:15:26,490
Money?

3475
02:15:27,310 --> 02:15:27,930
Money!

3476
02:15:30,610 --> 02:15:31,230
Yay!

3477
02:15:31,810 --> 02:15:32,090
Money!

3478
02:15:33,190 --> 02:15:33,690
Okay.

3479
02:15:33,850 --> 02:15:35,130
That should be 400.

3480
02:15:35,210 --> 02:15:37,350
I'm going like a candy wrapper in an updraft!

3481
02:15:37,890 --> 02:15:38,210
Whee!

3482
02:15:40,950 --> 02:15:42,230
Gotta get up here.

3483
02:15:42,650 --> 02:15:43,490
Wait, there's so many!

3484
02:15:46,350 --> 02:15:47,150
Wait, what?

3485
02:15:48,490 --> 02:15:49,670
It was like...

3486
02:15:49,670 --> 02:15:50,650
On this side.

3487
02:15:50,890 --> 02:15:51,870
But how do I get up there?

3488
02:15:52,870 --> 02:15:53,650
Oh, here.

3489
02:15:55,030 --> 02:15:56,990
Okay, and then...

3490
02:15:56,990 --> 02:15:57,350
That's right.

3491
02:15:57,350 --> 02:15:58,010
I saw you.

3492
02:15:58,190 --> 02:15:59,210
I saw you!

3493
02:16:00,930 --> 02:16:01,810
Get over here!

3494
02:16:02,930 --> 02:16:03,790
Alright, nice.

3495
02:16:04,150 --> 02:16:05,390
Okay, we need a hundred more.

3496
02:16:05,550 --> 02:16:06,790
And then we have the forbidden donut.

3497
02:16:08,090 --> 02:16:08,530
Okay.

3498
02:16:10,610 --> 02:16:11,050
Alright.

3499
02:16:12,770 --> 02:16:13,210
Nice!

3500
02:16:13,330 --> 02:16:14,110
And there's a bee too!

3501
02:16:14,930 --> 02:16:15,350
No!

3502
02:16:15,530 --> 02:16:15,850
Don't!

3503
02:16:15,910 --> 02:16:16,090
No!

3504
02:16:16,270 --> 02:16:16,830
Don't do it!

3505
02:16:16,970 --> 02:16:17,210
Nice!

3506
02:16:18,530 --> 02:16:19,190
And that's enough.

3507
02:16:19,730 --> 02:16:20,370
That's enough!

3508
02:16:20,750 --> 02:16:21,170
Alright!

3509
02:16:21,330 --> 02:16:21,550
Goodbye!

3510
02:16:21,670 --> 02:16:22,510
Wait, there's another bee!

3511
02:16:24,830 --> 02:16:25,350
Can't bee!

3512
02:16:25,350 --> 02:16:25,550
Can't bee!

3513
02:16:26,410 --> 02:16:27,030
Jesus Christ!

3514
02:16:28,410 --> 02:16:28,930
Ah!

3515
02:16:29,190 --> 02:16:29,770
Okay, nice.

3516
02:16:31,170 --> 02:16:31,950
Where'd he go?

3517
02:16:33,070 --> 02:16:34,090
Where'd the bee go?

3518
02:16:34,210 --> 02:16:34,870
Get over here!

3519
02:16:35,370 --> 02:16:36,330
Are you serious?

3520
02:16:36,490 --> 02:16:37,750
Get your ass down here bee!

3521
02:16:39,050 --> 02:16:40,530
Alright, you win this time.

3522
02:16:42,130 --> 02:16:43,450
You win this time.

3523
02:16:43,750 --> 02:16:45,950
I'm too lazy to get to the other side.

3524
02:16:50,870 --> 02:16:51,390
Alright.

3525
02:16:51,390 --> 02:16:53,850
I'm pretty sure you can buy clothes at...

3526
02:16:53,850 --> 02:16:54,890
The quickie mart.

3527
02:16:55,210 --> 02:16:57,170
I have to go to the bathroom real fast!

3528
02:16:57,270 --> 02:16:57,510
Yay!

3529
02:17:01,110 --> 02:17:03,050
The forbidden donut.

3530
02:17:05,510 --> 02:17:06,110
Mmmmmmm.

3531
02:17:10,010 --> 02:17:13,090
What do you have that will tantalize my very discerning palette?

3532
02:17:13,510 --> 02:17:18,250
Perhaps the crazy name of my new crazy value combo will appeal to you.

3533
02:17:21,490 --> 02:17:23,250
It's like an infinite food glitch.

3534
02:17:25,870 --> 02:17:27,990
I mean like, couldn't I just fix myself?

3535
02:17:28,310 --> 02:17:28,930
I just...

3536
02:17:28,930 --> 02:17:30,590
I can just like technically...

3537
02:17:31,010 --> 02:17:31,990
Wait, what does...

3538
02:17:31,990 --> 02:17:32,870
What does he want?

3539
02:17:33,050 --> 02:17:33,830
Can you help me out?

3540
02:17:34,010 --> 02:17:36,570
There's some scary, weird, godless, fascinating stuff going on.

3541
02:17:36,570 --> 02:17:38,870
I can just like, you know, get donut batter.

3542
02:17:38,870 --> 02:17:40,890
I can just like piece myself back together.

3543
02:17:41,430 --> 02:17:41,890
You know how it is.

3544
02:17:42,110 --> 02:17:43,350
Whatever, just give me the mission.

3545
02:17:45,090 --> 02:17:45,650
Alright.

3546
02:17:45,890 --> 02:17:49,010
Help Smitters find items for Mr. Burns before time runs out.

3547
02:17:50,310 --> 02:17:50,870
Cake.

3548
02:17:52,330 --> 02:17:53,050
Sock guarders.

3549
02:17:54,250 --> 02:17:56,250
Where do you keep the sock guarders?

3550
02:17:57,850 --> 02:17:59,050
Dingy goes up.

3551
02:17:59,870 --> 02:18:01,050
Oh, it's up here.

3552
02:18:02,210 --> 02:18:02,770
Yay!

3553
02:18:05,170 --> 02:18:06,410
Oh shit, it's time.

3554
02:18:06,950 --> 02:18:08,270
I was taking my time.

3555
02:18:09,750 --> 02:18:11,490
Here you go, Mr. Smithers.

3556
02:18:11,810 --> 02:18:12,390
Oh, thank god.

3557
02:18:12,650 --> 02:18:14,570
His socks have been pooling around his ankles for days.

3558
02:18:14,930 --> 02:18:17,810
And this is his favorite brand, Alan Quartermain's Keep'em Ups.

3559
02:18:18,130 --> 02:18:18,330
Hmm.

3560
02:18:18,830 --> 02:18:19,330
What next?

3561
02:18:20,670 --> 02:18:21,570
What's my next?

3562
02:18:24,190 --> 02:18:25,070
What's this do?

3563
02:18:25,330 --> 02:18:25,630
Yeah.

3564
02:18:28,570 --> 02:18:29,310
Oh my god.

3565
02:18:29,430 --> 02:18:29,990
Oh my god.

3566
02:18:31,510 --> 02:18:32,450
Where is it?

3567
02:18:32,650 --> 02:18:33,310
Where is it?

3568
02:18:33,470 --> 02:18:33,590
Where is it?

3569
02:18:34,370 --> 02:18:35,890
Oh, it's open there!

3570
02:18:36,910 --> 02:18:37,550
Okay.

3571
02:18:38,810 --> 02:18:39,450
Okay.

3572
02:18:40,130 --> 02:18:40,390
Okay.

3573
02:18:40,870 --> 02:18:42,110
That's like fucked up.

3574
02:18:42,470 --> 02:18:43,930
That's actually fucked up.

3575
02:18:44,790 --> 02:18:46,450
That's actually fucked up.

3576
02:18:47,390 --> 02:18:48,030
I...

3577
02:18:51,990 --> 02:18:53,470
That's messed up, Smithers.

3578
02:18:55,630 --> 02:18:57,030
That's so messed up.

3579
02:18:57,210 --> 02:18:58,710
I don't have my car!

3580
02:18:59,990 --> 02:19:02,010
Wow, I need a disco nap.

3581
02:19:02,390 --> 02:19:04,350
I don't even think I can get there!

3582
02:19:04,770 --> 02:19:05,510
Oh my god!

3583
02:19:05,690 --> 02:19:06,730
I need a car!

3584
02:19:09,910 --> 02:19:11,090
Alright, we gotta...

3585
02:19:11,090 --> 02:19:12,390
We gotta steal a car.

3586
02:19:14,050 --> 02:19:14,610
Sweet!

3587
02:19:14,910 --> 02:19:16,710
We gotta steal a car before this.

3588
02:19:17,510 --> 02:19:20,790
Alright, we're gonna fail this first mission so we can steal a car.

3589
02:19:22,670 --> 02:19:23,230
Alright.

3590
02:19:23,770 --> 02:19:24,610
My car now.

3591
02:19:25,730 --> 02:19:28,210
Okay, we're gonna put this car right here.

3592
02:19:28,870 --> 02:19:29,430
Alright.

3593
02:19:30,590 --> 02:19:31,910
Okay, I cleaned the car.

3594
02:19:32,190 --> 02:19:33,570
So it should be mine now.

3595
02:19:33,790 --> 02:19:34,530
That's how it works.

3596
02:19:36,110 --> 02:19:38,050
Jesus Christ, that stupid hammer.

3597
02:19:39,090 --> 02:19:40,490
Oh my god, he's right here.

3598
02:19:40,790 --> 02:19:41,130
Smithers, please.

3599
02:19:41,270 --> 02:19:42,230
Smithers, you...

3600
02:19:42,970 --> 02:19:44,270
You saw me come back!

3601
02:19:44,610 --> 02:19:45,790
You saw...

3602
02:19:45,790 --> 02:19:48,650
You saw me come back, Smithers!

3603
02:19:49,250 --> 02:19:51,750
You knew I was coming back!

3604
02:19:54,830 --> 02:19:56,770
I was nearly right there, Smithers.

3605
02:19:57,310 --> 02:19:59,350
Why did you pretend you didn't see me?

3606
02:20:02,370 --> 02:20:02,670
Okay.

3607
02:20:03,230 --> 02:20:06,630
Oh my god, and I'm taking my sweet fucking time going up there.

3608
02:20:10,730 --> 02:20:11,470
I...

3609
02:20:14,020 --> 02:20:14,390
I...

3610
02:20:14,760 --> 02:20:15,200
No!

3611
02:20:16,830 --> 02:20:18,580
Okay, we're going to the playground.

3612
02:20:23,790 --> 02:20:25,100
We don't need to help him.

3613
02:20:25,980 --> 02:20:27,920
Mr. Burns is already a billionaire.

3614
02:20:28,280 --> 02:20:29,140
He doesn't need me.

3615
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,500
He doesn't need my help.

3616
02:20:33,940 --> 02:20:36,140
He has everything he has.

3617
02:20:38,600 --> 02:20:40,700
All right, let's go to the playground.

3618
02:20:41,220 --> 02:20:41,880
Yay!

3619
02:20:43,920 --> 02:20:45,820
What about the comic book guy?

3620
02:20:46,340 --> 02:20:46,420
Oh!

3621
02:20:46,860 --> 02:20:47,900
Goodbye, car!

3622
02:20:48,820 --> 02:20:49,500
Goodbye!

3623
02:20:52,020 --> 02:20:53,340
Oh my god!

3624
02:20:53,540 --> 02:20:54,880
Thank god that's not my car!

3625
02:20:55,240 --> 02:20:56,080
Oh shit!

3626
02:20:56,300 --> 02:20:57,460
That's my money, though!

3627
02:20:59,180 --> 02:21:00,520
Ow, my head!

3628
02:21:04,060 --> 02:21:07,560
It's not my car, but it is my money.

3629
02:21:08,180 --> 02:21:09,740
That's messed up.

3630
02:21:10,140 --> 02:21:11,720
That's messed up.

3631
02:21:14,720 --> 02:21:15,560
I...

3632
02:21:15,560 --> 02:21:16,800
Please, get over here.

3633
02:21:17,500 --> 02:21:17,920
Car.

3634
02:21:20,360 --> 02:21:22,380
It wasn't even my car!

3635
02:21:24,440 --> 02:21:26,320
I don't understand!

3636
02:21:30,600 --> 02:21:35,860
The alien craft is using some sort of tractor beam to suck up trespassers to their doom.

3637
02:21:36,600 --> 02:21:38,460
Worst effects ever!

3638
02:21:38,660 --> 02:21:39,440
But that's real!

3639
02:21:39,760 --> 02:21:41,860
Worst effects ever!

3640
02:21:42,140 --> 02:21:43,300
What's with the cool black car?

3641
02:21:43,500 --> 02:21:46,640
My knowledge of sci-fi movies is correct, which it is.

3642
02:21:47,120 --> 02:21:49,880
The black car is an advanced probe for the mothership.

3643
02:21:50,240 --> 02:21:50,780
What?

3644
02:21:51,320 --> 02:21:54,760
I will spend my last hours on earth complaining about movies on the internet.

3645
02:21:55,080 --> 02:21:55,640
Nice!

3646
02:21:57,300 --> 02:21:58,700
Hope you have fun already!

3647
02:21:58,700 --> 02:22:01,600
If you obtain a zombie car, it will protect you well.

3648
02:22:01,860 --> 02:22:02,440
But...

3649
02:22:02,440 --> 02:22:04,200
It runs on human brains.

3650
02:22:04,420 --> 02:22:05,380
It's like drawback.

3651
02:22:05,660 --> 02:22:06,800
I got plenty of those!

3652
02:22:07,680 --> 02:22:08,160
Yeah!

3653
02:22:09,380 --> 02:22:10,500
You'll need the zombie car.

3654
02:22:10,620 --> 02:22:12,300
Purchase it from the zombie at the...

3655
02:22:12,300 --> 02:22:13,400
For 500...

3656
02:22:13,400 --> 02:22:14,020
Or call it...

3657
02:22:14,020 --> 02:22:14,780
Oh my god.

3658
02:22:15,100 --> 02:22:17,580
I spent it on the forbidden donut.

3659
02:22:18,080 --> 02:22:20,180
How was I supposed to...

3660
02:22:20,180 --> 02:22:20,400
No!

3661
02:22:21,760 --> 02:22:22,920
That was...

3662
02:22:23,550 --> 02:22:23,840
No!

3663
02:22:23,840 --> 02:22:24,020
No!

3664
02:22:26,480 --> 02:22:28,720
How was I supposed to...

3665
02:22:28,720 --> 02:22:29,180
No!

3666
02:22:29,940 --> 02:22:30,460
Just paint!

3667
02:22:35,440 --> 02:22:40,300
I used all my money so I can have a funny hat!

3668
02:22:40,300 --> 02:22:41,340
Hahaha!

3669
02:22:43,760 --> 02:22:45,020
Boiled again!

3670
02:22:45,340 --> 02:22:47,620
Cause I wanted a funny hat!

3671
02:22:48,540 --> 02:22:49,000
Run!

3672
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:49,620
I'm broke!

3673
02:22:51,120 --> 02:22:52,860
Good job donut.

3674
02:22:53,300 --> 02:22:54,960
I just went...

3675
02:22:54,960 --> 02:22:57,620
I just thought the hat was funny!

3676
02:22:58,460 --> 02:23:01,240
Not the farm for money!

3677
02:23:04,580 --> 02:23:07,380
There has to be money around here.

3678
02:23:08,460 --> 02:23:12,580
I look funny but at what cost?

3679
02:23:13,880 --> 02:23:14,560
Yeah.

3680
02:23:17,200 --> 02:23:18,840
What's Mr. Birds doing there?

3681
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:22,640
Wait, what?

3682
02:23:24,080 --> 02:23:25,420
What is he doing?

3683
02:23:28,790 --> 02:23:29,950
Give a hoot.

3684
02:23:30,730 --> 02:23:32,530
I can't believe he didn't make a cameo.

3685
02:23:32,610 --> 02:23:36,090
Of like the student burger.

3686
02:23:36,390 --> 02:23:40,730
I think that is like one of my favorite Treehouse of Horror episodes.

3687
02:23:41,690 --> 02:23:44,370
It's like the most memorable one for me.

3688
02:23:45,090 --> 02:23:50,190
Where they turn children into burgers.

3689
02:23:54,740 --> 02:23:56,240
Where the fuck is this?

3690
02:23:56,240 --> 02:23:57,180
I'm boat drifting?

3691
02:23:58,860 --> 02:24:00,100
Where are all the money?

3692
02:24:03,140 --> 02:24:05,720
Yeah, and then they grinded the children up.

3693
02:24:08,260 --> 02:24:08,940
Alright.

3694
02:24:10,680 --> 02:24:13,960
I missed when like... I think like...

3695
02:24:13,960 --> 02:24:15,720
Oh my god, please!

3696
02:24:18,520 --> 02:24:19,200
Please!

3697
02:24:19,660 --> 02:24:21,260
I have bad depth perception!

3698
02:24:21,260 --> 02:24:21,460
Shit!

3699
02:24:22,500 --> 02:24:29,240
I miss when Treehouse of Horror shows... Episodes... There's... It's... It's never a happy ending.

3700
02:24:30,480 --> 02:24:32,680
I think that makes it really... Fun.

3701
02:24:35,040 --> 02:24:37,520
Because you always think like... Oh, everything's gonna be okay.

3702
02:24:38,040 --> 02:24:41,780
But like... It's always like a sad ending or a bad ending.

3703
02:24:44,160 --> 02:24:45,840
Eat me if you insist.

3704
02:24:47,420 --> 02:24:48,220
Oh shit.

3705
02:24:49,340 --> 02:24:51,180
I wonder if there's anything at the cemetery.

3706
02:24:51,420 --> 02:24:51,780
I don't know.

3707
02:24:52,260 --> 02:24:54,200
Can I make enough money from this place alone?

3708
02:24:58,600 --> 02:24:59,120
Okay.

3709
02:24:59,340 --> 02:25:01,160
We're almost... We're almost at 200.

3710
02:25:02,980 --> 02:25:05,440
I don't know if I can make enough from this area.

3711
02:25:06,320 --> 02:25:07,720
I should be, right?

3712
02:25:10,260 --> 02:25:11,740
Oh look, there's scuds!

3713
02:25:13,340 --> 02:25:16,100
Yeah, I don't think I can afford any supercar.

3714
02:25:16,100 --> 02:25:18,860
I don't... I don't think so.

3715
02:25:19,340 --> 02:25:21,020
I can barely...

3716
02:25:21,900 --> 02:25:24,740
I can... I can barely afford anything here.

3717
02:25:25,940 --> 02:25:26,700
Wait.

3718
02:25:26,980 --> 02:25:28,120
I remember now.

3719
02:25:29,020 --> 02:25:31,680
All I need to do is destroy cars.

3720
02:25:32,880 --> 02:25:34,480
That's the infinite money glitch.

3721
02:25:36,280 --> 02:25:37,960
Okay, I need to...

3722
02:25:39,900 --> 02:25:41,100
I need to grab...

3723
02:25:43,880 --> 02:25:45,540
Okay, I need to grab like a truck.

3724
02:25:45,760 --> 02:25:46,980
And then I'll start destroying cars.

3725
02:25:48,480 --> 02:25:49,560
Where's Mr. Plow?

3726
02:25:50,280 --> 02:25:51,300
Mr. Plow?

3727
02:25:51,460 --> 02:25:52,540
That's my name?

3728
02:25:52,820 --> 02:25:53,840
Oh, Mr. Plow.

3729
02:25:54,120 --> 02:25:54,180
Oh.

3730
02:25:54,760 --> 02:25:56,500
How did I still forgot to...

3731
02:25:56,500 --> 02:25:59,180
How did I still forget to repair you?

3732
02:25:59,800 --> 02:26:00,360
Okay.

3733
02:26:02,060 --> 02:26:03,020
Alright, it's time.

3734
02:26:03,340 --> 02:26:03,700
Oh wait.

3735
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:05,860
Free money.

3736
02:26:06,480 --> 02:26:10,380
No, if I use the UFO beam, it destroys my cars.

3737
02:26:11,100 --> 02:26:11,920
And then...

3738
02:26:11,920 --> 02:26:14,440
And then I lose my money.

3739
02:26:15,220 --> 02:26:16,880
But I have destroyed cars here.

3740
02:26:18,200 --> 02:26:18,920
Alright.

3741
02:26:19,240 --> 02:26:19,780
It's time.

3742
02:26:20,940 --> 02:26:22,320
My first target.

3743
02:26:23,620 --> 02:26:24,880
Get over here.

3744
02:26:25,840 --> 02:26:27,120
You skeleton car.

3745
02:26:27,860 --> 02:26:28,980
I know you're weak.

3746
02:26:29,340 --> 02:26:30,400
Look at you.

3747
02:26:30,860 --> 02:26:32,320
You have nothing to...

3748
02:26:32,320 --> 02:26:33,320
Nothing in your life.

3749
02:26:33,800 --> 02:26:34,680
Get over here.

3750
02:26:35,800 --> 02:26:36,740
That's right.

3751
02:26:38,960 --> 02:26:39,680
Boom!

3752
02:26:41,420 --> 02:26:42,140
Come on!

3753
02:26:42,860 --> 02:26:43,940
Got you in the corner!

3754
02:26:44,180 --> 02:26:44,360
Whoops!

3755
02:26:45,040 --> 02:26:46,480
Okay, maybe this will take longer.

3756
02:26:47,040 --> 02:26:47,320
Maybe...

3757
02:26:47,320 --> 02:26:48,180
Okay, but like...

3758
02:26:48,180 --> 02:26:48,860
I'm in too deep.

3759
02:26:49,880 --> 02:26:50,660
I'm in too deep.

3760
02:26:50,800 --> 02:26:51,500
I have to destroy it.

3761
02:26:57,540 --> 02:26:58,580
I'm in too deep.

3762
02:26:59,180 --> 02:27:00,800
I have to destroy it now.

3763
02:27:03,260 --> 02:27:03,860
That's right.

3764
02:27:04,460 --> 02:27:04,660
That's right.

3765
02:27:06,020 --> 02:27:06,700
Oh shit.

3766
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:08,380
Okay, did I run over a child?

3767
02:27:09,100 --> 02:27:10,160
No, I didn't, right?

3768
02:27:10,920 --> 02:27:11,580
Alright, we wait.

3769
02:27:13,740 --> 02:27:15,100
I can hit him one more time.

3770
02:27:16,040 --> 02:27:16,940
Alright, we wait.

3771
02:27:17,700 --> 02:27:19,340
Okay, this is a little too long.

3772
02:27:20,020 --> 02:27:20,820
Alright, we...

3773
02:27:22,300 --> 02:27:24,740
We have to find enough money.

3774
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:27,460
I can ram it again.

3775
02:27:27,600 --> 02:27:29,930
I'm a lean, mean speed thingy.

3776
02:27:30,760 --> 02:27:31,520
Come on!

3777
02:27:32,940 --> 02:27:33,560
Explode!

3778
02:27:36,540 --> 02:27:37,900
Oh my god.

3779
02:27:38,060 --> 02:27:38,740
I fucked up.

3780
02:27:39,080 --> 02:27:40,440
I fucked up.

3781
02:27:40,760 --> 02:27:41,420
I fucked...

3782
02:27:41,420 --> 02:27:41,840
It's okay.

3783
02:27:42,040 --> 02:27:42,720
It's okay.

3784
02:27:42,980 --> 02:27:43,600
The quickie mark.

3785
02:27:43,600 --> 02:27:44,460
The spooky mark.

3786
02:27:45,880 --> 02:27:46,360
The spooky mark.

3787
02:27:46,360 --> 02:27:46,500
The spooky mark.

3788
02:27:46,500 --> 02:27:46,620
The spooky mark.

3789
02:27:46,620 --> 02:27:46,840
The spooky mark.

3790
02:27:46,840 --> 02:27:47,080
The spooky mark.

3791
02:27:47,080 --> 02:27:47,260
The spooky mark.

3792
02:27:47,640 --> 02:27:47,780
The

3793
02:27:52,890 --> 02:27:55,990
spooky mark.

3794
02:27:55,990 --> 02:27:56,330
The spooky mark.

3795
02:27:56,330 --> 02:27:56,490
The spooky mark.

3796
02:27:57,210 --> 02:27:58,250
The spooky mark.

3797
02:27:58,250 --> 02:27:58,410
The spooky mark.

3798
02:27:58,410 --> 02:27:58,850
The spooky mark.

3799
02:27:59,330 --> 02:27:59,350
The spooky mark.

3800
02:28:00,210 --> 02:28:00,250
The spooky mark.

3801
02:28:01,330 --> 02:28:02,930
The spooky mark.

3802
02:28:03,490 --> 02:28:04,070
The spooky mark.

3803
02:28:08,130 --> 02:28:09,090
The spooky mark.

3804
02:28:10,270 --> 02:28:11,650
The spooky mark.

3805
02:28:11,650 --> 02:28:13,390
The bar will save me.

3806
02:28:15,280 --> 02:28:17,050
It's not there.

3807
02:28:17,730 --> 02:28:22,070
The quickie bar was right there.

3808
02:28:24,350 --> 02:28:26,570
I don't understand.

3809
02:28:31,880 --> 02:28:33,870
There shouldn't be consequences.

3810
02:28:36,030 --> 02:28:39,190
Where's my get-out-of-jail-free card?

3811
02:28:40,570 --> 02:28:41,890
Who lives here?

3812
02:28:45,030 --> 02:28:45,930
Hey, a stranger!

3813
02:28:47,110 --> 02:28:48,930
The door says, knock, knock.

3814
02:28:49,150 --> 02:28:49,810
Let me in.

3815
02:28:49,870 --> 02:28:50,810
Are you the Easter Bunny?

3816
02:28:51,250 --> 02:28:51,590
Yeah?

3817
02:28:51,770 --> 02:28:52,730
Hey, a stranger!

3818
02:28:53,270 --> 02:28:55,550
Oh, is that stranger who's in, Ralph?

3819
02:28:56,550 --> 02:28:58,490
I'm just your daddy's friend.

3820
02:28:58,790 --> 02:28:59,970
Very good friend.

3821
02:29:01,170 --> 02:29:04,230
Oh my god, I lost so much!

3822
02:29:04,950 --> 02:29:06,650
And then I'm stopped!

3823
02:29:07,970 --> 02:29:09,050
Okay, that's fine.

3824
02:29:09,210 --> 02:29:09,690
I got it.

3825
02:29:10,690 --> 02:29:11,970
That's fine, I got it.

3826
02:29:12,830 --> 02:29:13,730
I'm okay.

3827
02:29:15,630 --> 02:29:17,150
Alright, nice.

3828
02:29:18,690 --> 02:29:22,450
Oh my god, I would've been at 250, by the way, if I didn't get arrested.

3829
02:29:23,490 --> 02:29:29,370
If I didn't get arrested, I would've been at 250 right now.

3830
02:29:30,730 --> 02:29:32,070
Is that crazy?

3831
02:29:32,930 --> 02:29:34,030
Who would've thought?

3832
02:29:34,030 --> 02:29:34,110
What?

3833
02:29:36,350 --> 02:29:37,790
We could've been there.

3834
02:29:38,830 --> 02:29:40,670
We could've all been there.

3835
02:29:43,990 --> 02:29:45,110
That's crazy.

3836
02:29:47,450 --> 02:29:50,550
Oh my god, I missed.

3837
02:29:50,790 --> 02:29:51,930
I won't miss again.

3838
02:29:54,770 --> 02:29:55,770
That's fucking right.

3839
02:29:57,530 --> 02:29:58,690
That's what you get.

3840
02:29:58,910 --> 02:29:59,250
That's what you get.

3841
02:29:59,250 --> 02:29:59,650
Wiggum.

3842
02:30:00,570 --> 02:30:01,810
That's your real name.

3843
02:30:04,370 --> 02:30:05,530
Okay, we are fine.

3844
02:30:08,010 --> 02:30:08,490
Wee.

3845
02:30:08,790 --> 02:30:09,270
Oh.

3846
02:30:10,310 --> 02:30:11,890
Oh wait, nice, we're on the other side.

3847
02:30:12,130 --> 02:30:13,050
Okay, is there anything here?

3848
02:30:15,670 --> 02:30:17,110
Okay, that's just parkour.

3849
02:30:17,110 --> 02:30:18,290
No, there's nothing here.

3850
02:30:18,990 --> 02:30:20,030
God dammit.

3851
02:30:20,190 --> 02:30:21,750
There has to be more money.

3852
02:30:22,170 --> 02:30:23,110
Oh nice, here.

3853
02:30:25,430 --> 02:30:25,950
Alright.

3854
02:30:27,310 --> 02:30:28,730
Nice, we got more money.

3855
02:30:28,730 --> 02:30:30,110
I'm not a very good driver.

3856
02:30:30,110 --> 02:30:31,250
There has to be more.

3857
02:30:33,910 --> 02:30:34,310
Please.

3858
02:30:36,270 --> 02:30:38,390
There has to be more money somewhere.

3859
02:30:38,850 --> 02:30:40,110
Learn to drive, dumbass.

3860
02:30:42,110 --> 02:30:44,130
Oh my god, it's just farming.

3861
02:30:45,110 --> 02:30:45,690
Oh, you're right.

3862
02:30:45,810 --> 02:30:46,690
There's money at the school.

3863
02:30:46,990 --> 02:30:48,050
Okay, we'll go for here first.

3864
02:30:48,050 --> 02:30:48,710
Now, okay.

3865
02:30:49,310 --> 02:30:51,470
I've been reading this here hog weekly.

3866
02:30:51,790 --> 02:30:53,570
I like the special features.

3867
02:30:53,930 --> 02:30:54,250
Dingy.

3868
02:30:55,170 --> 02:30:55,870
Whew, dang.

3869
02:30:56,450 --> 02:30:57,710
What did I at?

3870
02:30:58,030 --> 02:30:58,450
Damn.

3871
02:30:58,690 --> 02:31:00,650
Who puts a doorbell at a...

3872
02:31:00,650 --> 02:31:01,290
What's it called?

3873
02:31:01,970 --> 02:31:03,310
At those thingies.

3874
02:31:03,470 --> 02:31:04,290
I don't remember what it's called.

3875
02:31:05,330 --> 02:31:06,970
At a port-a-potty.

3876
02:31:07,550 --> 02:31:09,190
Can't you see I'm driving here?

3877
02:31:09,430 --> 02:31:11,070
You gotta put all your attention.

3878
02:31:12,350 --> 02:31:14,470
They're like using the port-a-potty.

3879
02:31:16,370 --> 02:31:17,770
Oh, the out-out house.

3880
02:31:17,950 --> 02:31:19,610
Oh, the port-a-potty is like the other thing.

3881
02:31:20,510 --> 02:31:21,930
It's the one with the concerts.

3882
02:31:22,950 --> 02:31:24,490
Oh, there has to be money here, right?

3883
02:31:24,810 --> 02:31:26,710
It's a fire area.

3884
02:31:29,030 --> 02:31:30,010
Is there money here?

3885
02:31:31,010 --> 02:31:31,470
Money.

3886
02:31:32,330 --> 02:31:32,790
Money.

3887
02:31:33,810 --> 02:31:35,610
Here, money, money, money, money.

3888
02:31:36,710 --> 02:31:38,710
Here, money, money, money.

3889
02:31:39,890 --> 02:31:41,430
Where is my money?

3890
02:31:44,810 --> 02:31:45,990
Come on, boy.

3891
02:31:47,090 --> 02:31:48,230
Come on, boy.

3892
02:31:49,570 --> 02:31:51,430
Yoki needs the money.

3893
02:31:51,970 --> 02:31:53,270
For her mission.

3894
02:31:54,190 --> 02:31:56,410
Oh my god, there's a UFO crash here.

3895
02:31:59,250 --> 02:31:59,570
Okay.

3896
02:32:01,570 --> 02:32:02,870
Wait, there's some...

3897
02:32:02,870 --> 02:32:03,670
There's a button.

3898
02:32:03,870 --> 02:32:04,650
I gotta press it.

3899
02:32:07,150 --> 02:32:08,110
What's it do?

3900
02:32:11,170 --> 02:32:12,570
Doesn't seem so bad.

3901
02:32:16,230 --> 02:32:17,250
Oh my god.

3902
02:32:18,150 --> 02:32:18,650
Why?

3903
02:32:19,070 --> 02:32:21,230
Why did I buy the forbidden donut?

3904
02:32:21,570 --> 02:32:22,070
Guys!

3905
02:32:23,390 --> 02:32:25,470
Why did we buy the forbidden...

3906
02:32:25,470 --> 02:32:26,570
Oh my god, I can't see.

3907
02:32:26,890 --> 02:32:28,050
I broke the game.

3908
02:32:28,930 --> 02:32:29,130
Okay.

3909
02:32:30,350 --> 02:32:31,130
Guys, it's okay.

3910
02:32:31,170 --> 02:32:31,750
I'm okay now.

3911
02:32:31,890 --> 02:32:33,330
Guys, we're not doing a betting race.

3912
02:32:33,510 --> 02:32:36,670
I know, personally, that we're not gonna win.

3913
02:32:38,950 --> 02:32:43,630
I know, personally, that it's not gonna be okay if we do it.

3914
02:32:45,390 --> 02:32:46,490
Okay, nice.

3915
02:32:49,330 --> 02:32:50,650
Oh my god.

3916
02:32:51,150 --> 02:32:54,750
If I didn't get arrested, we'd be at 350.

3917
02:32:58,510 --> 02:32:58,870
Why?

3918
02:32:58,870 --> 02:32:59,550
Why?

3919
02:33:01,390 --> 02:33:04,190
Why did no one stop me?

3920
02:33:07,650 --> 02:33:08,350
Okay.

3921
02:33:09,490 --> 02:33:10,270
Parkour.

3922
02:33:10,650 --> 02:33:11,750
Parkour.

3923
02:33:12,530 --> 02:33:13,570
Parkour.

3924
02:33:16,570 --> 02:33:17,650
Okay, nice.

3925
02:33:20,870 --> 02:33:21,650
Alright.

3926
02:33:22,450 --> 02:33:24,930
Oh, this could be an infinite money glitch, too.

3927
02:33:25,830 --> 02:33:26,910
But, let me kick everything.

3928
02:33:28,790 --> 02:33:29,840
Not anymore.

3929
02:33:35,270 --> 02:33:36,330
That's right.

3930
02:33:37,370 --> 02:33:39,070
I can't be stopped.

3931
02:33:40,130 --> 02:33:42,390
No infinite money glitch here.

3932
02:33:44,590 --> 02:33:49,170
You're like, Doki, why do you cry when you make this harder for yourself?

3933
02:33:53,190 --> 02:33:56,970
You only make this harder for yourself, Doki.

3934
02:33:59,270 --> 02:33:59,950
No!

3935
02:34:03,470 --> 02:34:05,730
Okay, let me climb up this again.

3936
02:34:07,230 --> 02:34:07,910
Parkour.

3937
02:34:12,100 --> 02:34:12,920
Parkour.

3938
02:34:12,920 --> 02:34:13,520
Alright, nice.

3939
02:34:13,940 --> 02:34:14,660
And then...

3940
02:34:15,520 --> 02:34:17,000
Alright, we go this way.

3941
02:34:18,580 --> 02:34:19,660
It's okay.

3942
02:34:19,900 --> 02:34:20,740
Everything's fine.

3943
02:34:24,320 --> 02:34:25,840
Go up here.

3944
02:34:28,310 --> 02:34:29,080
Okay, nice.

3945
02:34:30,300 --> 02:34:31,300
Go up here.

3946
02:34:32,200 --> 02:34:33,020
Parkour.

3947
02:34:33,620 --> 02:34:34,440
Parkour.

3948
02:34:35,220 --> 02:34:36,040
Parkour!

3949
02:34:37,680 --> 02:34:38,500
Yes!

3950
02:34:39,660 --> 02:34:40,380
We made it!

3951
02:34:40,620 --> 02:34:41,160
Oh, shit!

3952
02:34:41,440 --> 02:34:42,200
Oh, shit!

3953
02:34:47,900 --> 02:34:48,580
Okay.

3954
02:34:49,180 --> 02:34:50,460
Now that I...

3955
02:34:54,260 --> 02:34:54,940
Okay.

3956
02:34:55,480 --> 02:34:57,000
Now that I know...

3957
02:34:57,260 --> 02:34:58,660
Those are trapped...

3958
02:34:59,180 --> 02:34:59,440
Oh...

3959
02:35:02,920 --> 02:35:03,600
Okay.

3960
02:35:05,420 --> 02:35:05,760
Okay.

3961
02:35:05,760 --> 02:35:07,460
It should...

3962
02:35:07,460 --> 02:35:07,860
It should...

3963
02:35:09,780 --> 02:35:10,580
Please!

3964
02:35:12,920 --> 02:35:14,520
There's no...

3965
02:35:14,520 --> 02:35:16,760
There's no way...

3966
02:35:17,720 --> 02:35:19,020
There's no...

3967
02:35:19,020 --> 02:35:20,100
Which way is it?

3968
02:35:22,300 --> 02:35:23,100
Here.

3969
02:35:23,640 --> 02:35:23,960
Okay.

3970
02:35:24,380 --> 02:35:25,180
Okay.

3971
02:35:25,480 --> 02:35:26,480
Okay, it's not there.

3972
02:35:26,480 --> 02:35:27,620
Alright.

3973
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:29,420
Now that I know...

3974
02:35:29,420 --> 02:35:30,480
The pathway...

3975
02:35:32,660 --> 02:35:34,500
I swear to fucking god.

3976
02:35:34,700 --> 02:35:34,820
Okay.

3977
02:35:35,100 --> 02:35:36,860
Now that I know...

3978
02:35:36,860 --> 02:35:38,480
The correct path...

3979
02:35:40,320 --> 02:35:41,300
Get over here.

3980
02:35:41,500 --> 02:35:42,960
I need to kick him!

3981
02:35:43,500 --> 02:35:43,900
Okay.

3982
02:35:45,540 --> 02:35:46,180
Okay.

3983
02:35:47,080 --> 02:35:48,280
I swear to god!

3984
02:35:48,520 --> 02:35:49,900
I swear to god!

3985
02:35:50,360 --> 02:35:50,720
I swear to god!

3986
02:35:50,720 --> 02:35:51,100
Get out of here!

3987
02:35:51,400 --> 02:35:51,680
No!

3988
02:35:52,080 --> 02:35:52,160
No!

3989
02:35:52,340 --> 02:35:53,000
There's no way!

3990
02:35:54,220 --> 02:35:54,620
Okay.

3991
02:35:56,680 --> 02:35:58,320
Okay, this is the best I can do.

3992
02:36:00,900 --> 02:36:01,420
No!

3993
02:36:06,250 --> 02:36:06,770
Alright.

3994
02:36:07,310 --> 02:36:08,050
Two here.

3995
02:36:09,370 --> 02:36:09,890
Here.

3996
02:36:10,790 --> 02:36:11,830
And then...

3997
02:36:11,830 --> 02:36:12,530
This way.

3998
02:36:14,850 --> 02:36:15,650
Then what?

3999
02:36:16,090 --> 02:36:18,490
There has to be a mission for this area.

4000
02:36:18,670 --> 02:36:21,290
There's no way they made me go all the way here for nothing.

4001
02:36:21,630 --> 02:36:23,130
There has to be...

4002
02:36:23,690 --> 02:36:25,510
There has to be a mission here.

4003
02:36:25,690 --> 02:36:27,350
I did all of this for nothing.

4004
02:36:27,570 --> 02:36:28,950
I can't believe it.

4005
02:36:32,290 --> 02:36:33,590
Get me out of here.

4006
02:36:34,230 --> 02:36:35,850
There was a mission here.

4007
02:36:37,350 --> 02:36:39,810
And I just did it early for no reason.

4008
02:36:42,130 --> 02:36:42,650
Ooh!

4009
02:36:43,110 --> 02:36:43,630
Spooky!

4010
02:36:46,930 --> 02:36:47,450
No!

4011
02:36:47,630 --> 02:36:49,110
Not my bikini zone!

4012
02:36:51,930 --> 02:36:52,450
Okay.

4013
02:36:52,750 --> 02:36:53,850
I need a fine...

4014
02:36:53,850 --> 02:36:54,850
I'm not doing a race.

4015
02:36:55,030 --> 02:36:55,810
He can't make me.

4016
02:36:56,570 --> 02:36:57,890
I'm gonna boat drift.

4017
02:36:59,670 --> 02:37:01,090
How much money do I have?

4018
02:37:02,250 --> 02:37:02,910
Oh no.

4019
02:37:02,950 --> 02:37:03,630
I don't even know.

4020
02:37:07,030 --> 02:37:08,730
I don't even know how much money I got.

4021
02:37:19,310 --> 02:37:20,390
Oh, there's money!

4022
02:37:25,400 --> 02:37:26,160
Money time!

4023
02:37:28,700 --> 02:37:30,180
There has to be a bee up here, right?

4024
02:37:31,460 --> 02:37:32,620
If I didn't get arrested.

4025
02:37:32,780 --> 02:37:34,240
If I didn't get arrested.

4026
02:37:34,600 --> 02:37:35,720
I'm so sad.

4027
02:37:35,720 --> 02:37:36,540
Never!

4028
02:37:37,060 --> 02:37:37,700
Run!

4029
02:37:39,220 --> 02:37:40,820
As an actual...

4030
02:37:41,320 --> 02:37:42,900
If I didn't get arrested...

4031
02:37:43,960 --> 02:37:44,700
Oh my god!

4032
02:37:44,840 --> 02:37:45,960
And the bee was up!

4033
02:37:46,080 --> 02:37:46,560
Get down!

4034
02:37:46,920 --> 02:37:49,200
Get down, you fucking bee!

4035
02:37:56,420 --> 02:37:58,000
Why is the bee up here?

4036
02:38:02,060 --> 02:38:04,060
Like, how am I supposed to do anything?

4037
02:38:04,520 --> 02:38:04,920
I...

4038
02:38:04,920 --> 02:38:05,260
I...

4039
02:38:05,260 --> 02:38:05,960
Oh my god!

4040
02:38:06,100 --> 02:38:06,340
Get down!

4041
02:38:06,560 --> 02:38:06,800
Nice!

4042
02:38:09,360 --> 02:38:10,260
I hate you!

4043
02:38:11,060 --> 02:38:12,600
I've hated you so much!

4044
02:38:15,480 --> 02:38:16,040
That's right!

4045
02:38:16,240 --> 02:38:16,920
I need a disco nap!

4046
02:38:19,080 --> 02:38:19,480
No!

4047
02:38:19,680 --> 02:38:19,920
No!

4048
02:38:22,980 --> 02:38:23,380
No!

4049
02:38:29,690 --> 02:38:30,350
No, no, no, no!

4050
02:38:30,550 --> 02:38:31,150
Oh, thank god!

4051
02:38:31,290 --> 02:38:32,310
Okay, okay, okay.

4052
02:38:32,410 --> 02:38:33,470
We're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

4053
02:38:33,890 --> 02:38:34,410
We're fine.

4054
02:38:34,410 --> 02:38:35,790
Oh my god, we're so close!

4055
02:38:35,890 --> 02:38:36,650
We are so close!

4056
02:38:36,770 --> 02:38:37,050
We are so close!

4057
02:38:37,050 --> 02:38:37,570
We have $12!

4058
02:38:40,750 --> 02:38:41,190
Ouch!

4059
02:38:41,410 --> 02:38:43,030
But the key zone's chafing!

4060
02:38:43,710 --> 02:38:45,190
We have four...

4061
02:38:45,190 --> 02:38:47,350
We need like $12 more dollars!

4062
02:38:49,250 --> 02:38:50,390
I'm so sad.

4063
02:38:50,850 --> 02:38:53,530
I don't know why I thought there'd be random money here.

4064
02:38:54,450 --> 02:38:54,970
Fudge up!

4065
02:38:55,110 --> 02:38:56,150
Thank you for the super chat!

4066
02:38:56,290 --> 02:38:56,570
Thank you!

4067
02:38:56,750 --> 02:38:57,270
Thank you!

4068
02:38:57,990 --> 02:39:06,610
Remember when Ralph's mom, Wiggum White, was secretly a master criminal and it was revealed that Martin Prince was a fourth grader with a wife and kids?

4069
02:39:06,730 --> 02:39:07,130
Oh yeah!

4070
02:39:08,710 --> 02:39:09,750
That was weird.

4071
02:39:09,970 --> 02:39:13,510
I just remember talking about it before in an earlier play... like in an earlier...

4072
02:39:13,970 --> 02:39:14,730
Wait, what's this?

4073
02:39:14,850 --> 02:39:15,430
It's a toilet!

4074
02:39:15,430 --> 02:39:17,790
In an earlier playthrough...

4075
02:39:17,790 --> 02:39:18,470
Where like...

4076
02:39:18,470 --> 02:39:18,850
Um...

4077
02:39:18,850 --> 02:39:20,490
They like retconned...

4078
02:39:20,490 --> 02:39:21,430
They retconned...

4079
02:39:22,310 --> 02:39:22,830
Um...

4080
02:39:22,830 --> 02:39:23,370
What's her name?

4081
02:39:23,510 --> 02:39:23,790
Sarah?

4082
02:39:24,730 --> 02:39:26,070
Sarah Wiggum's story.

4083
02:39:26,330 --> 02:39:29,430
And then for some reason, just made her like a fucking...

4084
02:39:30,150 --> 02:39:30,810
Like she made...

4085
02:39:30,810 --> 02:39:32,110
They made her like a criminal.

4086
02:39:32,350 --> 02:39:33,550
And the only reason she like...

4087
02:39:34,930 --> 02:39:35,450
Um...

4088
02:39:35,450 --> 02:39:37,270
The only reason she like...

4089
02:39:37,270 --> 02:39:39,550
Got together with...

4090
02:39:39,550 --> 02:39:40,510
Oh my god, we got 500.

4091
02:39:40,690 --> 02:39:42,870
The only reason why she got together with...

4092
02:39:43,570 --> 02:39:44,090
Um...

4093
02:39:44,090 --> 02:39:45,890
Wiggum was because like...

4094
02:39:45,890 --> 02:39:47,130
She needed to distract him.

4095
02:39:47,870 --> 02:39:49,550
For like a heist or some shit.

4096
02:39:50,270 --> 02:39:51,450
And it's so weird.

4097
02:39:53,850 --> 02:39:55,850
Yeah, Martin's an undercover cop.

4098
02:39:56,170 --> 02:39:57,530
But that was not canon.

4099
02:39:57,730 --> 02:39:58,190
That was like...

4100
02:39:58,190 --> 02:39:59,090
They did like a...

4101
02:39:59,090 --> 02:39:59,710
What's it called?

4102
02:40:00,330 --> 02:40:01,950
Like those episodic...

4103
02:40:01,950 --> 02:40:02,670
Like those like...

4104
02:40:03,270 --> 02:40:03,790
Random...

4105
02:40:04,910 --> 02:40:05,530
Clip show?

4106
02:40:05,710 --> 02:40:06,370
Like clip show?

4107
02:40:06,610 --> 02:40:08,170
Of clips that never actually happened?

4108
02:40:11,210 --> 02:40:11,970
Alright, nice.

4109
02:40:12,090 --> 02:40:13,190
We got the zombie cart.

4110
02:40:13,370 --> 02:40:15,050
We fucking finally did it.

4111
02:40:16,510 --> 02:40:17,390
We fucking...

4112
02:40:17,390 --> 02:40:17,750
Did it.

4113
02:40:18,630 --> 02:40:20,290
Yeah, and the what if episodes.

4114
02:40:20,450 --> 02:40:20,770
Yeah, yeah.

4115
02:40:20,930 --> 02:40:23,710
So it's like the Futurama one was like the what ifs episode.

4116
02:40:23,910 --> 02:40:24,510
So they did that.

4117
02:40:29,850 --> 02:40:31,310
Find out where the alien car is headed.

4118
02:40:31,490 --> 02:40:32,310
Follow the car.

4119
02:40:33,390 --> 02:40:34,550
Alright, I got it.

4120
02:40:35,250 --> 02:40:36,290
Where's my car?

4121
02:40:36,290 --> 02:40:38,210
Dude, where's my car?

4122
02:40:41,070 --> 02:40:41,970
Oh my god.

4123
02:40:42,230 --> 02:40:43,390
Drive to the school player.

4124
02:40:44,490 --> 02:40:46,030
But this car is pretty good.

4125
02:40:46,590 --> 02:40:47,930
But I like this car.

4126
02:40:49,230 --> 02:40:51,650
This guy is pretty fucking good.

4127
02:40:55,330 --> 02:41:01,150
I like how the only real person in this entire world right now is Bumblebee man.

4128
02:41:01,150 --> 02:41:03,430
Is it because he's like Spanish?

4129
02:41:04,230 --> 02:41:05,330
Like I don't understand.

4130
02:41:06,450 --> 02:41:08,510
Why is he not infected?

4131
02:41:08,830 --> 02:41:09,450
He's just...

4132
02:41:11,030 --> 02:41:11,970
He's just...

4133
02:41:11,970 --> 02:41:13,990
He's just a regular guy.

4134
02:41:19,450 --> 02:41:21,130
Because he's like Mexican?

4135
02:41:24,230 --> 02:41:25,950
He's like...

4136
02:41:25,950 --> 02:41:27,350
Nothing lasts forever.

4137
02:41:28,130 --> 02:41:31,050
The Bumblebee man is doing his best.

4138
02:41:32,270 --> 02:41:32,490
Oh wait.

4139
02:41:32,610 --> 02:41:33,430
They're stealing car.

4140
02:41:34,530 --> 02:41:34,670
Oh.

4141
02:41:37,570 --> 02:41:38,470
Goodbye.

4142
02:41:38,470 --> 02:41:38,710
I...

4143
02:41:51,370 --> 02:41:53,230
It's crashing time.

4144
02:41:53,490 --> 02:41:55,250
It was like that when I got here.

4145
02:41:56,050 --> 02:41:57,230
Where is that?

4146
02:41:57,630 --> 02:41:58,790
Where is he?

4147
02:41:59,570 --> 02:42:00,210
Where is he?

4148
02:42:00,210 --> 02:42:00,790
Where is he?

4149
02:42:03,110 --> 02:42:04,470
I forgot.

4150
02:42:05,100 --> 02:42:08,270
I forgot that he could abduct me.

4151
02:42:09,300 --> 02:42:10,850
I just saw him float.

4152
02:42:11,210 --> 02:42:12,290
What hit me?

4153
02:42:13,260 --> 02:42:14,290
What hit me?

4154
02:42:14,510 --> 02:42:15,570
What hit me?

4155
02:42:16,380 --> 02:42:17,740
What hit me?

4156
02:42:20,070 --> 02:42:22,630
What fucking hit me?

4157
02:42:22,830 --> 02:42:24,750
I don't understand.

4158
02:42:27,450 --> 02:42:28,350
Car...

4159
02:42:28,350 --> 02:42:31,350
There was an invisible wall?

4160
02:42:31,350 --> 02:42:31,490
Oh!

4161
02:42:35,460 --> 02:42:36,620
He's gonna go here.

4162
02:42:36,800 --> 02:42:37,720
And wait for him.

4163
02:42:39,780 --> 02:42:40,260
USA!

4164
02:42:42,600 --> 02:42:44,380
I don't know where he's gonna go.

4165
02:42:44,560 --> 02:42:45,560
I'm just waiting for him.

4166
02:42:47,680 --> 02:42:48,160
Okay.

4167
02:42:48,240 --> 02:42:48,940
He's going this way.

4168
02:42:49,480 --> 02:42:49,840
Okay.

4169
02:42:49,980 --> 02:42:51,440
I literally don't know where he's gonna go.

4170
02:42:51,680 --> 02:42:52,780
I don't know now.

4171
02:42:55,160 --> 02:42:56,200
Are you serious?

4172
02:42:56,500 --> 02:42:57,720
Are you serious?

4173
02:42:57,720 --> 02:43:00,800
I was so ahead and I hit...

4174
02:43:00,800 --> 02:43:03,460
Got hit by one random fucking car.

4175
02:43:06,960 --> 02:43:09,020
That was actually bullshit.

4176
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:11,020
Holy fuck.

4177
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,780
That random fucking car fucked me over.

4178
02:43:19,860 --> 02:43:20,340
Yeah.

4179
02:43:20,960 --> 02:43:22,780
Fucking stupid ass.

4180
02:43:25,100 --> 02:43:25,640
Okay.

4181
02:43:26,420 --> 02:43:26,760
No.

4182
02:43:27,020 --> 02:43:27,400
No.

4183
02:43:27,780 --> 02:43:28,200
No.

4184
02:43:28,480 --> 02:43:29,240
It's not fair.

4185
02:43:29,440 --> 02:43:31,200
He's putting them in my pathway.

4186
02:43:32,460 --> 02:43:35,120
I have road rage and I know how to use it.

4187
02:43:35,340 --> 02:43:38,020
Like how could it be my fault when they're dead?

4188
02:43:38,440 --> 02:43:39,740
They have no rights!

4189
02:43:44,600 --> 02:43:45,920
Oh my god.

4190
02:43:46,780 --> 02:43:47,900
I can't see.

4191
02:43:48,260 --> 02:43:49,600
I can't see.

4192
02:43:49,880 --> 02:43:50,460
Oh nice.

4193
02:43:50,580 --> 02:43:50,980
I did it.

4194
02:43:52,380 --> 02:43:52,940
Hello.

4195
02:43:53,180 --> 02:43:53,340
Whoops.

4196
02:43:53,580 --> 02:43:54,240
Sorry professor.

4197
02:43:57,300 --> 02:43:59,880
I'm glad you're here, my morbidly obese ally.

4198
02:44:00,260 --> 02:44:04,600
Based on my mathulations, I figured out the alien's weakness.

4199
02:44:04,840 --> 02:44:06,420
It's nuclear waste.

4200
02:44:06,920 --> 02:44:07,340
Yuck.

4201
02:44:07,600 --> 02:44:09,140
And how does that affect me?

4202
02:44:09,140 --> 02:44:11,980
Well, it could save the life of you and your family.

4203
02:44:12,180 --> 02:44:12,720
And?

4204
02:44:12,960 --> 02:44:13,180
And?

4205
02:44:13,420 --> 02:44:17,200
Look, I've loaded my vehicle with nuclear waste from the power plant.

4206
02:44:17,440 --> 02:44:20,600
It's going to deliver this toxic payload to the alien ship.

4207
02:44:21,080 --> 02:44:22,800
Risking myself and my...

4208
02:44:22,800 --> 02:44:24,420
Oh, we're driving to the UFO!

4209
02:44:25,100 --> 02:44:26,780
Which if you've never undergone that...

4210
02:44:26,780 --> 02:44:29,180
Alright guys, this time we'll intentionally get abducted.

4211
02:44:29,660 --> 02:44:31,680
And I never knew his name.

4212
02:44:31,940 --> 02:44:33,440
It's Professor John Frank.

4213
02:44:33,620 --> 02:44:34,500
Professor who?

4214
02:44:36,340 --> 02:44:37,860
Oh my god, guys!

4215
02:44:39,140 --> 02:44:40,260
Let's do this thing!

4216
02:44:40,260 --> 02:44:40,840
Finally!

4217
02:44:43,040 --> 02:44:44,920
Guys, I got so much practice.

4218
02:44:45,180 --> 02:44:45,840
It'll be fine.

4219
02:44:46,400 --> 02:44:47,060
I...

4220
02:44:48,460 --> 02:44:51,240
Guys, that's what all the practice was for, guys.

4221
02:44:52,720 --> 02:44:56,480
All that practice was for this very moment.

4222
02:44:57,400 --> 02:44:59,200
Of being abducted.

4223
02:45:00,500 --> 02:45:02,500
We're training for that...

4224
02:45:02,500 --> 02:45:03,920
Jesus Christ, I'm just...

4225
02:45:03,920 --> 02:45:04,980
Give me a sec, Professor.

4226
02:45:05,180 --> 02:45:06,480
I'm just hitting every tree.

4227
02:45:06,480 --> 02:45:07,760
I...

4228
02:45:08,380 --> 02:45:11,720
All that practice was for this very moment!

4229
02:45:13,740 --> 02:45:16,020
Don't worry about me hitting all those trees earlier.

4230
02:45:17,380 --> 02:45:18,740
Don't worry, I'm okay.

4231
02:45:22,740 --> 02:45:24,380
It will go through the cemetery.

4232
02:45:25,960 --> 02:45:26,640
Weeeee!

4233
02:45:27,780 --> 02:45:28,280
Oops!

4234
02:45:45,460 --> 02:45:46,240
Oops!

4235
02:45:54,520 --> 02:45:55,980
She's breaking up!

4236
02:45:56,260 --> 02:45:57,180
She's breaking up!

4237
02:45:57,480 --> 02:45:57,800
Oh!

4238
02:46:02,340 --> 02:46:08,200
Guys, nobody told me that nuclear waste was so fragile!

4239
02:46:11,820 --> 02:46:14,880
Why was I not worried about this?

4240
02:46:15,120 --> 02:46:22,120
How was I supposed to know that nuclear waste was so fragile, Chad?

4241
02:46:22,540 --> 02:46:25,100
How could anyone would have known?

4242
02:46:30,140 --> 02:46:33,900
All I'm saying is that it was not intuitive.

4243
02:46:34,420 --> 02:46:37,580
Oh my god, that car is so tiny that I don't even see him.

4244
02:46:38,920 --> 02:46:40,500
It was not intuitive!

4245
02:46:42,680 --> 02:46:44,200
It should have put a warning!

4246
02:46:44,560 --> 02:46:45,000
I know!

4247
02:46:47,500 --> 02:46:49,800
There's not enough warning about it!

4248
02:46:50,420 --> 02:46:51,580
Okay, if I...

4249
02:46:52,360 --> 02:46:53,240
Okay, there you go.

4250
02:46:53,740 --> 02:46:55,520
Yeah, this shouldn't activate it this time.

4251
02:46:56,480 --> 02:46:57,740
Oh, you're fucking kidding me.

4252
02:46:58,080 --> 02:46:58,940
If you arrest me.

4253
02:47:00,100 --> 02:47:01,880
If you arrest me, I have no money.

4254
02:47:04,320 --> 02:47:06,140
You gain nothing from arresting me.

4255
02:47:07,940 --> 02:47:08,640
Okay.

4256
02:47:08,640 --> 02:47:09,160
Okay.

4257
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:10,560
Okay.

4258
02:47:11,380 --> 02:47:11,840
We're fine.

4259
02:47:12,680 --> 02:47:13,780
Are you serious?

4260
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:14,860
Are you serious?

4261
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:15,920
Okay, we're fine still.

4262
02:47:17,720 --> 02:47:18,940
We're still fine.

4263
02:47:22,080 --> 02:47:22,780
Okay.

4264
02:47:23,220 --> 02:47:24,020
I see the school.

4265
02:47:24,500 --> 02:47:24,700
Wait, no.

4266
02:47:24,780 --> 02:47:25,860
That's the retirement home.

4267
02:47:25,860 --> 02:47:26,560
No!

4268
02:47:27,960 --> 02:47:29,180
Speed thingy!

4269
02:47:29,400 --> 02:47:30,460
Please don't sue!

4270
02:47:30,840 --> 02:47:31,320
Coming through!

4271
02:47:34,900 --> 02:47:36,340
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

4272
02:47:56,020 --> 02:47:57,740
Can't you see I'm driving here?

4273
02:48:16,810 --> 02:48:19,570
Reckless driving is my pet peeve.

4274
02:49:20,620 --> 02:49:22,960
I'm gonna eat my sandwich.

4275
02:49:23,340 --> 02:49:23,620
Move it!

4276
02:49:23,940 --> 02:49:25,920
My egg salad sandwich.

4277
02:49:29,980 --> 02:49:35,180
I'm gonna eat my sandwich.

4278
02:49:35,300 --> 02:49:40,140
I'm gonna eat my sandwich if I can fucking rip the stupid sticker off the box!

4279
02:49:40,140 --> 02:49:40,400
I'm gonna eat my sandwich.

4280
02:49:42,740 --> 02:49:45,280
Why is it a- Oh!

4281
02:49:47,360 --> 02:49:48,300
Give me a sec.

4282
02:49:48,500 --> 02:49:49,260
I don't...

4283
02:49:49,740 --> 02:49:51,180
Oh my god, I have no scissors.

4284
02:49:52,020 --> 02:49:53,840
No scissors in my...

4285
02:49:53,840 --> 02:49:54,680
Proof!

4286
02:49:55,140 --> 02:49:55,840
Okay.

4287
02:49:57,980 --> 02:49:58,980
It's fine.

4288
02:50:07,250 --> 02:50:08,930
Oh my god, don't worry.

4289
02:50:09,430 --> 02:50:09,810
Please.

4290
02:50:11,390 --> 02:50:14,090
Guys, I'm gonna lose it.

4291
02:50:14,230 --> 02:50:16,410
I can't even rip open.

4292
02:50:16,590 --> 02:50:17,230
That's stupid.

4293
02:50:17,950 --> 02:50:20,050
Oh my god, I did it.

4294
02:50:21,630 --> 02:50:23,730
Okay, I'll eat my egg sandwich.

4295
02:50:23,730 --> 02:50:26,930
Oh my god, there's cucumbers in my...

4296
02:50:26,930 --> 02:50:28,550
I can't have anything.

4297
02:50:29,530 --> 02:50:32,010
I can't have anything in life.

4298
02:50:32,850 --> 02:50:35,630
There's cucumbers in my...

4299
02:50:44,590 --> 02:50:45,890
I'm so sad.

4300
02:50:46,910 --> 02:50:49,570
I have to, like, individually get rid of the cucumbers.

4301
02:50:50,770 --> 02:50:54,450
Oh my god, a sandwich would have been perfect if there was no cucumbers.

4302
02:50:56,430 --> 02:50:57,390
Okay, I'm okay.

4303
02:51:00,930 --> 02:51:02,250
I just ate...

4304
02:51:02,250 --> 02:51:03,710
I'm just not a cucumber fan.

4305
02:51:04,090 --> 02:51:04,530
Okay.

4306
02:51:11,590 --> 02:51:13,370
I'm very picky with my veggies.

4307
02:51:14,770 --> 02:51:20,250
The only veggies I like, in terms of, like, the green kind, is spinach.

4308
02:51:21,210 --> 02:51:22,190
The green veggies.

4309
02:51:23,210 --> 02:51:26,710
I like spinach and, like, I guess, like, Chinese cabbage.

4310
02:51:26,710 --> 02:51:29,330
You know the one where, like, it's dipped in, like, sweet sauce?

4311
02:51:29,770 --> 02:51:30,850
I don't remember what it's called.

4312
02:51:33,090 --> 02:51:33,410
Um...

4313
02:51:33,410 --> 02:51:33,970
Ah!

4314
02:51:34,170 --> 02:51:34,930
I can't remember.

4315
02:51:35,210 --> 02:51:37,470
Like, the way to cook, um, stir fry...

4316
02:51:37,470 --> 02:51:38,070
Is to stir fry...

4317
02:51:38,070 --> 02:51:38,170
Or steam.

4318
02:51:38,410 --> 02:51:38,570
Steam.

4319
02:51:40,390 --> 02:51:40,710
Um...

4320
02:51:40,710 --> 02:51:41,490
I don't remember what it's called.

4321
02:51:47,710 --> 02:51:49,470
I like brussels sprouts, too.

4322
02:51:50,770 --> 02:51:52,270
You're not getting the food!

4323
02:51:58,250 --> 02:52:00,010
Go thinks he's part of the team.

4324
02:52:04,590 --> 02:52:08,330
Sandwich needs an electric fluid driver to open.

4325
02:52:16,150 --> 02:52:18,230
Guys, I'm too lazy to Google right now.

4326
02:52:18,230 --> 02:52:19,930
Are cucumbers okay for dogs?

4327
02:52:23,770 --> 02:52:24,970
You're my Google.

4328
02:52:25,350 --> 02:52:26,070
Ah, Brock!

4329
02:52:27,730 --> 02:52:28,630
Ah, Brock!

4330
02:52:28,650 --> 02:52:29,510
Ah, Brock!

4331
02:52:29,730 --> 02:52:30,850
Can dogs eat cucumbers?

4332
02:52:32,590 --> 02:52:32,910
Yeah?

4333
02:52:33,270 --> 02:52:33,630
Alright.

4334
02:52:37,700 --> 02:52:38,360
Thanks, Brock.

4335
02:52:42,880 --> 02:52:43,640
Okay.

4336
02:52:44,720 --> 02:52:45,360
Alright.

4337
02:52:46,300 --> 02:52:47,720
I gave him my cucumbers.

4338
02:52:58,940 --> 02:53:01,040
A doggy amber cucumber.

4339
02:53:01,560 --> 02:53:03,060
And that was the thing about superchat.

4340
02:53:03,160 --> 02:53:03,440
Thank you.

4341
02:53:03,580 --> 02:53:04,120
Thank you.

4342
02:53:05,020 --> 02:53:06,100
Uh, workshop.

4343
02:53:06,320 --> 02:53:07,040
Thank you about superchat.

4344
02:53:07,120 --> 02:53:07,360
Thank you.

4345
02:53:07,460 --> 02:53:08,080
Thank you.

4346
02:53:09,720 --> 02:53:11,000
So, um...

4347
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:12,200
Tomatoes don't like cucumbers.

4348
02:53:12,420 --> 02:53:14,940
Veggie tails isn't gonna like that.

4349
02:53:17,920 --> 02:53:19,140
Veggie tails.

4350
02:53:19,620 --> 02:53:20,560
Veggie tails.

4351
02:53:21,160 --> 02:53:21,840
Veggie tails.

4352
02:53:22,540 --> 02:53:23,580
Veggie tails.

4353
02:53:24,160 --> 02:53:24,800
Broccoli.

4354
02:53:26,020 --> 02:53:26,660
Alright.

4355
02:53:26,700 --> 02:53:27,300
You want my crust?

4356
02:53:27,820 --> 02:53:28,000
Dad?

4357
02:53:28,940 --> 02:53:29,580
Here you go.

4358
02:53:29,840 --> 02:53:30,680
Want the crust?

4359
02:53:31,360 --> 02:53:32,600
I hate crust, by the way.

4360
02:53:32,680 --> 02:53:33,160
I'm a child.

4361
02:53:34,280 --> 02:53:34,440
Alright.

4362
02:53:37,680 --> 02:53:39,480
You know he's not fat, so it's fine.

4363
02:53:39,700 --> 02:53:40,520
I can give him all this.

4364
02:53:41,100 --> 02:53:41,240
Alright.

4365
02:53:41,480 --> 02:53:41,880
Ekrock.

4366
02:53:42,060 --> 02:53:43,100
I already gave him the crust.

4367
02:53:43,480 --> 02:53:43,900
Ekrock.

4368
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:45,800
I can dogs eat crust.

4369
02:53:47,020 --> 02:53:48,700
I should have said Ekrock first.

4370
02:53:56,640 --> 02:53:57,720
Literally a child.

4371
02:54:00,400 --> 02:54:00,960
Alright.

4372
02:54:01,860 --> 02:54:02,580
There you go.

4373
02:54:03,500 --> 02:54:03,700
Alright.

4374
02:54:03,700 --> 02:54:03,720
There you go.

4375
02:54:03,940 --> 02:54:04,240
No!

4376
02:54:04,760 --> 02:54:05,920
That can't be true!

4377
02:54:06,860 --> 02:54:08,180
Red is not...

4378
02:54:08,180 --> 02:54:09,320
Can't be bad for dogs.

4379
02:54:09,760 --> 02:54:10,860
There's no way!

4380
02:54:12,900 --> 02:54:14,700
Oh, don't freak me out, Brock.

4381
02:54:15,500 --> 02:54:16,800
Don't freak me out.

4382
02:54:18,940 --> 02:54:19,800
Just don't...

4383
02:54:19,800 --> 02:54:19,980
Okay.

4384
02:54:19,980 --> 02:54:21,500
That's all the crust you're gonna get.

4385
02:54:22,120 --> 02:54:22,820
That's all the crust you're gonna get.

4386
02:54:22,820 --> 02:54:22,860
That's it.

4387
02:54:23,260 --> 02:54:24,000
No more crust.

4388
02:54:27,480 --> 02:54:29,340
Bread is bad for everyone.

4389
02:54:29,500 --> 02:54:30,300
No way!

4390
02:54:32,180 --> 02:54:32,520
What?

4391
02:54:33,400 --> 02:54:34,680
Bread is bread!

4392
02:54:36,380 --> 02:54:38,060
I know it's bad for birds.

4393
02:54:38,480 --> 02:54:40,220
I say as I eat bread.

4394
02:54:44,310 --> 02:54:44,830
Okay.

4395
02:54:45,030 --> 02:54:45,150
Okay.

4396
02:54:45,270 --> 02:54:45,750
There's no way.

4397
02:54:45,950 --> 02:54:46,290
There's no way.

4398
02:54:46,330 --> 02:54:47,350
I just fed him like...

4399
02:54:47,350 --> 02:54:48,250
Like...

4400
02:54:48,250 --> 02:54:49,370
Two pieces of crust.

4401
02:54:49,850 --> 02:54:50,830
From the side.

4402
02:54:52,090 --> 02:54:52,610
Alright.

4403
02:54:52,610 --> 02:54:53,170
He's fine.

4404
02:54:53,370 --> 02:54:53,530
Okay.

4405
02:54:53,550 --> 02:54:54,070
I believe.

4406
02:54:54,490 --> 02:54:57,050
I believe you random stranger on the internet.

4407
02:55:01,690 --> 02:55:02,550
I believe.

4408
02:55:21,770 --> 02:55:23,230
I tapped out.

4409
02:55:25,510 --> 02:55:26,350
I-

4410
02:55:30,890 --> 02:55:33,030
I accidentally tapped out.

4411
02:55:52,950 --> 02:55:55,170
When did I last save my game?

4412
02:56:28,400 --> 02:56:30,060
How much do I have to do?

4413
02:56:30,680 --> 02:56:32,680
How much do I have to do?

4414
02:56:33,260 --> 02:56:35,280
How much do I have to do?

4415
02:56:56,810 --> 02:56:58,270
I don't remember.

4416
02:57:00,360 --> 02:57:00,500
Let me...

4417
02:57:00,500 --> 02:57:02,800
Let me start thinking of that.

4418
02:57:02,800 --> 02:57:05,680
It was an accident.

4419
02:57:06,120 --> 02:57:08,560
It was an accident.

4420
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,520
I didn't mean to.

4421
02:57:15,500 --> 02:57:16,500
No.

4422
02:57:17,540 --> 02:57:17,960
No.

4423
02:57:18,660 --> 02:57:21,960
No, I can't do this to me.

4424
02:57:22,720 --> 02:57:23,720
I...

4425
02:57:29,790 --> 02:57:31,430
No.

4426
02:57:32,770 --> 02:57:33,530
No.

4427
02:58:15,910 --> 02:58:19,170
Okay, we don't buy the head.

4428
02:58:19,170 --> 02:58:21,210
That's okay.

4429
02:58:21,490 --> 02:58:22,350
That's okay.

4430
02:58:25,100 --> 02:58:27,940
Thank you for the stupid chat.

4431
02:58:28,360 --> 02:58:28,920
Guys.

4432
02:58:29,320 --> 02:58:30,080
Guys.

4433
02:58:30,300 --> 02:58:31,060
We don't.

4434
02:58:31,120 --> 02:58:31,880
We don't.

4435
02:58:31,880 --> 02:58:33,020
We don't.

4436
02:58:33,320 --> 02:58:34,080
We don't buy the head.

4437
02:58:34,640 --> 02:58:36,140
We don't.

4438
02:58:36,560 --> 02:58:37,680
No head.

4439
02:58:38,180 --> 02:58:39,060
No head.

4440
02:58:39,980 --> 02:58:40,220
Guys.

4441
02:58:41,780 --> 02:58:43,620
Oh my god.

4442
02:58:44,740 --> 02:58:47,220
Oh my god.

4443
02:58:47,220 --> 02:58:51,560
I'm so sad.

4444
02:58:54,400 --> 02:58:57,580
We worked so hard.

4445
02:58:58,640 --> 02:59:00,400
There's no way.

4446
02:59:01,700 --> 02:59:02,600
Oh my god.

4447
02:59:02,600 --> 02:59:03,660
There's no way.

4448
02:59:04,060 --> 02:59:06,180
There's no fucking way.

4449
02:59:06,180 --> 02:59:11,340
I don't even remember where was the hardest part in this game.

4450
02:59:12,240 --> 02:59:12,880
Why?

4451
02:59:13,320 --> 02:59:15,800
Why would you block my map?

4452
02:59:16,720 --> 02:59:17,280
Please.

4453
02:59:17,460 --> 02:59:18,940
I'm going through so much.

4454
02:59:20,080 --> 02:59:21,080
Hey, come back here.

4455
02:59:21,280 --> 02:59:22,680
Dems are sleeping on board.

4456
02:59:22,700 --> 02:59:23,700
Oh my god.

4457
02:59:24,360 --> 02:59:27,380
Guess I'll have to use a hawk for a pillow.

4458
02:59:27,420 --> 02:59:28,280
Oh my god.

4459
02:59:28,380 --> 02:59:30,240
I can't believe it.

4460
02:59:30,240 --> 02:59:34,240
I... I... I can't believe it.

4461
02:59:34,380 --> 02:59:35,780
I can't believe that.

4462
02:59:36,940 --> 02:59:38,800
Oh, I forgot my mission.

4463
02:59:39,140 --> 02:59:39,420
Nothing.

4464
02:59:40,180 --> 02:59:43,520
I can't believe this happened to me.

4465
02:59:45,120 --> 02:59:45,460
Why?

4466
02:59:47,180 --> 02:59:50,720
I... I don't... Why did I tap Alex?

4467
02:59:50,860 --> 02:59:51,620
Oh my god.

4468
02:59:51,640 --> 02:59:52,080
I have a weapon.

4469
02:59:52,100 --> 02:59:53,540
Why did I tap Alex?

4470
02:59:54,220 --> 02:59:56,220
How did this happen?

4471
02:59:58,340 --> 03:00:01,000
We could have avoided this.

4472
03:00:04,610 --> 03:00:06,150
Oh my god.

4473
03:00:06,770 --> 03:00:06,950
Please.

4474
03:00:08,030 --> 03:00:09,930
Please let me...

4475
03:00:09,930 --> 03:00:12,110
Please let me get close.

4476
03:00:13,770 --> 03:00:14,830
Oh my god.

4477
03:00:14,830 --> 03:00:15,390
There it is.

4478
03:00:16,070 --> 03:00:16,890
There it is.

4479
03:00:17,010 --> 03:00:18,150
I finished it.

4480
03:00:19,170 --> 03:00:23,910
I can't take advantage of the infinite money bug now.

4481
03:00:24,510 --> 03:00:25,690
It's too late.

4482
03:00:26,130 --> 03:00:27,450
It's too late.

4483
03:00:29,470 --> 03:00:29,950
JL.

4484
03:00:30,190 --> 03:00:31,770
Thank you for the Aka Super.

4485
03:00:31,950 --> 03:00:32,610
Thank you.

4486
03:00:32,810 --> 03:00:33,390
Thank you.

4487
03:00:34,150 --> 03:00:35,930
Also, thank you for the Super Chat.

4488
03:00:36,170 --> 03:00:36,470
Thank you.

4489
03:00:36,610 --> 03:00:37,190
Thank you.

4490
03:00:38,910 --> 03:00:39,870
Absolute sin.

4491
03:00:40,070 --> 03:00:41,130
Can you come and get me?

4492
03:00:41,350 --> 03:00:42,030
I'll pay you a contract.

4493
03:00:42,490 --> 03:00:43,210
Oh my god.

4494
03:00:44,190 --> 03:00:45,910
All my progress.

4495
03:00:48,630 --> 03:00:49,110
Oh.

4496
03:00:51,330 --> 03:00:53,330
I can't believe it.

4497
03:00:55,310 --> 03:00:57,310
How did this happen to me?

4498
03:00:57,310 --> 03:00:59,850
I've been a good boy.

4499
03:01:02,170 --> 03:01:02,850
Okay.

4500
03:01:03,370 --> 03:01:04,050
Okay.

4501
03:01:04,050 --> 03:01:04,850
It'll be fine.

4502
03:01:05,170 --> 03:01:05,430
Joki.

4503
03:01:05,590 --> 03:01:06,090
It'll be fine.

4504
03:01:06,490 --> 03:01:08,410
You do not have enough money.

4505
03:01:08,630 --> 03:01:10,890
But you can get all your money back.

4506
03:01:11,910 --> 03:01:14,590
You just need $500.

4507
03:01:15,990 --> 03:01:16,670
I...

4508
03:01:17,390 --> 03:01:20,350
I didn't think it was gonna happen.

4509
03:01:21,170 --> 03:01:22,870
What are the odds?

4510
03:01:27,540 --> 03:01:29,720
What were the Joki A's?

4511
03:01:30,400 --> 03:01:32,200
Who bet on this?

4512
03:01:32,280 --> 03:01:32,840
Coming through.

4513
03:01:34,520 --> 03:01:35,840
Who bet on it?

4514
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:36,940
What were the odds?

4515
03:01:37,260 --> 03:01:38,340
Was it 1 to 8?

4516
03:01:38,860 --> 03:01:39,380
What is that?

4517
03:01:50,480 --> 03:01:53,260
I have 31...

4518
03:01:53,260 --> 03:01:54,880
Where did all my money go?

4519
03:01:55,280 --> 03:01:55,780
Where...

4520
03:01:57,620 --> 03:01:58,920
Oh my god.

4521
03:02:01,740 --> 03:02:02,260
Feebus.

4522
03:02:02,540 --> 03:02:03,840
Thank you for the super chat.

4523
03:02:04,080 --> 03:02:04,440
Thank you.

4524
03:02:04,620 --> 03:02:05,100
Thank you.

4525
03:02:05,520 --> 03:02:10,200
Like my teachers in college once said publicly in front of the whole class.

4526
03:02:10,400 --> 03:02:12,240
A student who was failing the class.

4527
03:02:12,240 --> 03:02:12,960
Don't worry.

4528
03:02:12,960 --> 03:02:16,360
It's always easier the second time.

4529
03:02:17,020 --> 03:02:18,020
How did I...

4530
03:02:18,020 --> 03:02:19,360
I'm broke?

4531
03:02:26,030 --> 03:02:27,530
Oh my god.

4532
03:02:27,790 --> 03:02:29,290
There are level skip codes.

4533
03:02:29,430 --> 03:02:30,030
It's too late.

4534
03:02:30,990 --> 03:02:32,310
I'm here now.

4535
03:02:32,630 --> 03:02:33,350
It's too late.

4536
03:02:35,550 --> 03:02:36,230
Wait.

4537
03:02:36,490 --> 03:02:37,470
There's nothing up here?

4538
03:02:38,350 --> 03:02:39,150
Oh wait.

4539
03:02:39,230 --> 03:02:39,710
There it is.

4540
03:02:41,450 --> 03:02:42,490
Oh my god.

4541
03:02:44,590 --> 03:02:46,130
I'm already here.

4542
03:02:48,670 --> 03:02:50,790
I'll miss you forbidden donut.

4543
03:02:51,730 --> 03:02:53,630
You are so good to me.

4544
03:02:56,810 --> 03:02:57,490
Akrok.

4545
03:02:57,750 --> 03:02:58,670
How could this happen?

4546
03:03:04,350 --> 03:03:05,030
Akrok.

4547
03:03:05,970 --> 03:03:07,890
How could this happen to me?

4548
03:03:13,890 --> 03:03:14,950
Oh my god.

4549
03:03:15,130 --> 03:03:18,390
Back to the stupid fucking zombie car.

4550
03:03:20,830 --> 03:03:21,470
Akrok.

4551
03:03:21,910 --> 03:03:22,310
Why me?

4552
03:03:23,170 --> 03:03:24,650
I've been a good boy.

4553
03:03:27,490 --> 03:03:28,130
Okay.

4554
03:03:28,290 --> 03:03:28,690
200.

4555
03:03:29,170 --> 03:03:31,030
We know where all the money is.

4556
03:03:32,270 --> 03:03:36,130
The good thing is that now I didn't waste all my money.

4557
03:03:36,490 --> 03:03:39,090
I didn't waste all my money this time.

4558
03:03:39,430 --> 03:03:40,970
So there's the good news.

4559
03:03:44,490 --> 03:03:46,090
I just need to go home.

4560
03:03:48,410 --> 03:03:49,290
Where's home?

4561
03:03:50,030 --> 03:03:50,890
Oh my god.

4562
03:03:51,070 --> 03:03:51,470
Where's home?

4563
03:03:54,550 --> 03:03:55,710
Where is it?

4564
03:03:56,930 --> 03:03:57,890
Where's home?

4565
03:03:59,990 --> 03:04:00,810
Oh my god.

4566
03:04:00,910 --> 03:04:01,290
There's home.

4567
03:04:01,830 --> 03:04:02,410
I just got...

4568
03:04:02,410 --> 03:04:02,830
Oh.

4569
03:04:03,150 --> 03:04:03,230
Oh.

4570
03:04:03,590 --> 03:04:03,890
Wait.

4571
03:04:04,250 --> 03:04:05,290
Oh my god.

4572
03:04:05,530 --> 03:04:06,070
My...

4573
03:04:06,070 --> 03:04:06,770
My food!

4574
03:04:08,150 --> 03:04:08,690
No.

4575
03:04:09,630 --> 03:04:10,650
Give me a sec.

4576
03:04:27,400 --> 03:04:28,960
My food's gonna be here.

4577
03:04:29,100 --> 03:04:29,480
Guys.

4578
03:04:29,800 --> 03:04:31,480
My food's gonna be here in five minutes.

4579
03:04:32,180 --> 03:04:32,460
Alright.

4580
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:33,880
Let me grab...

4581
03:04:35,780 --> 03:04:36,300
Okay.

4582
03:04:36,480 --> 03:04:36,920
We got it.

4583
03:04:37,680 --> 03:04:38,140
Thanks.

4584
03:04:38,200 --> 03:04:38,780
It's the default.

4585
03:04:39,520 --> 03:04:41,400
The alarm is the default.

4586
03:04:41,540 --> 03:04:42,160
Thank you guys.

4587
03:04:42,620 --> 03:04:42,920
Alright.

4588
03:04:43,160 --> 03:04:44,340
I know there's money here.

4589
03:04:44,880 --> 03:04:45,400
Alright.

4590
03:04:45,400 --> 03:04:47,120
We got to save our game.

4591
03:04:47,120 --> 03:04:47,460
We got to save our game.

4592
03:04:47,460 --> 03:04:48,000
Just in case.

4593
03:04:48,860 --> 03:04:49,820
Just in case.

4594
03:04:50,760 --> 03:04:52,760
I can't believe...

4595
03:04:52,760 --> 03:04:54,760
I can't believe I...

4596
03:04:54,760 --> 03:04:55,300
I don't know.

4597
03:04:59,700 --> 03:05:01,940
I don't even remember.

4598
03:05:02,700 --> 03:05:05,960
I don't remember how hard that level was too.

4599
03:05:06,580 --> 03:05:07,800
That's the worst part.

4600
03:05:10,240 --> 03:05:11,100
Oh my god.

4601
03:05:11,340 --> 03:05:11,420
Okay.

4602
03:05:12,720 --> 03:05:12,820
Alright.

4603
03:05:12,980 --> 03:05:13,620
Two hundred...

4604
03:05:13,620 --> 03:05:14,020
Three hundred.

4605
03:05:14,700 --> 03:05:16,660
I know there was a lot of money here.

4606
03:05:20,440 --> 03:05:21,140
Get over here.

4607
03:05:21,860 --> 03:05:23,220
Why are you over here?

4608
03:05:23,480 --> 03:05:24,180
Oh my god.

4609
03:05:24,280 --> 03:05:24,600
That's fine.

4610
03:05:24,760 --> 03:05:25,100
That's fine.

4611
03:05:25,240 --> 03:05:26,120
He can't shoot me from there.

4612
03:05:27,560 --> 03:05:28,120
Okay.

4613
03:05:29,820 --> 03:05:30,380
Okay.

4614
03:05:30,380 --> 03:05:30,500
Alright.

4615
03:05:31,060 --> 03:05:31,740
That's okay.

4616
03:05:32,220 --> 03:05:33,180
We're at three hundred.

4617
03:05:33,800 --> 03:05:34,640
Oh my...

4618
03:05:34,640 --> 03:05:35,600
Are you...

4619
03:05:35,600 --> 03:05:35,920
How?

4620
03:05:36,220 --> 03:05:37,540
What is your AoE?

4621
03:05:38,940 --> 03:05:40,180
Oh my god.

4622
03:05:42,480 --> 03:05:43,460
Oh god.

4623
03:05:43,580 --> 03:05:43,720
Okay.

4624
03:05:43,800 --> 03:05:44,140
I leave.

4625
03:05:44,880 --> 03:05:45,560
I leave.

4626
03:05:46,580 --> 03:05:47,000
Okay.

4627
03:05:47,580 --> 03:05:48,300
The moment...

4628
03:05:48,300 --> 03:05:48,460
Okay.

4629
03:05:48,540 --> 03:05:51,360
I will have to BRB when I get the second call.

4630
03:05:52,200 --> 03:05:54,660
Because the second call is when I have to...

4631
03:05:54,660 --> 03:05:55,980
Let him in.

4632
03:05:56,720 --> 03:05:57,260
Upstairs.

4633
03:05:58,100 --> 03:05:58,900
Alright.

4634
03:05:59,480 --> 03:06:00,260
That's fine.

4635
03:06:00,920 --> 03:06:02,180
We're almost at four hundred.

4636
03:06:06,280 --> 03:06:08,040
We're almost at four hundred.

4637
03:06:08,240 --> 03:06:08,520
It's fine.

4638
03:06:09,040 --> 03:06:10,880
And now we're at four hundred.

4639
03:06:11,460 --> 03:06:12,260
Look at that.

4640
03:06:12,740 --> 03:06:13,840
We're doing it.

4641
03:06:14,040 --> 03:06:15,580
Slow and steady.

4642
03:06:16,840 --> 03:06:19,380
So slow and steady.

4643
03:06:21,040 --> 03:06:22,360
So slow.

4644
03:06:22,840 --> 03:06:23,060
No.

4645
03:06:27,900 --> 03:06:28,700
It's okay.

4646
03:06:29,660 --> 03:06:30,520
It's okay.

4647
03:06:30,920 --> 03:06:31,820
And then...

4648
03:06:31,820 --> 03:06:32,980
And then it's the...

4649
03:06:32,980 --> 03:06:34,060
And then it's the quickie mart.

4650
03:06:35,620 --> 03:06:36,680
Solid snake.

4651
03:06:37,300 --> 03:06:38,580
Thank you for the super chat.

4652
03:06:38,740 --> 03:06:39,080
Thank you.

4653
03:06:39,160 --> 03:06:40,020
Thank you.

4654
03:06:40,600 --> 03:06:42,260
Does doki pursue content?

4655
03:06:42,400 --> 03:06:44,080
Does content pursue doki?

4656
03:06:44,180 --> 03:06:45,200
We'll never know.

4657
03:06:45,980 --> 03:06:46,260
It's okay.

4658
03:06:46,560 --> 03:06:47,300
And then...

4659
03:06:48,740 --> 03:06:50,960
And then we go to the quickie mart.

4660
03:06:53,580 --> 03:06:55,180
Where is the quickie mart?

4661
03:06:55,340 --> 03:06:56,260
Please don't sue.

4662
03:06:57,380 --> 03:06:59,760
Where is the mart that makes it go quick?

4663
03:06:59,940 --> 03:07:00,640
Oh, there it is.

4664
03:07:01,040 --> 03:07:01,920
I see it.

4665
03:07:02,200 --> 03:07:02,460
No.

4666
03:07:02,640 --> 03:07:03,560
That's not the quickie mart.

4667
03:07:04,200 --> 03:07:05,120
That's the...

4668
03:07:05,120 --> 03:07:06,280
Zombie bird.

4669
03:07:06,400 --> 03:07:07,100
Where the fuck...

4670
03:07:07,100 --> 03:07:07,420
Okay, wait.

4671
03:07:07,540 --> 03:07:08,240
We don't need the quickie mart.

4672
03:07:08,600 --> 03:07:09,620
We have this.

4673
03:07:10,700 --> 03:07:11,540
Oh my god.

4674
03:07:11,560 --> 03:07:12,640
It was the other way.

4675
03:07:13,040 --> 03:07:15,020
It was the other fucking way.

4676
03:07:15,580 --> 03:07:16,200
That's okay.

4677
03:07:16,680 --> 03:07:17,900
This should be enough.

4678
03:07:19,360 --> 03:07:20,480
And then...

4679
03:07:20,480 --> 03:07:21,660
And there's another one.

4680
03:07:21,940 --> 03:07:22,880
Oh, I wanted a peanut.

4681
03:07:23,500 --> 03:07:24,060
Alright.

4682
03:07:24,940 --> 03:07:26,300
We're so close.

4683
03:07:27,960 --> 03:07:28,520
95.

4684
03:07:31,440 --> 03:07:32,000
96.

4685
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:32,240
96.

4686
03:07:33,380 --> 03:07:34,140
97.

4687
03:07:35,820 --> 03:07:36,580
98.

4688
03:07:39,640 --> 03:07:42,620
If you hit my car, I swear to god.

4689
03:07:43,300 --> 03:07:46,580
If you hit my car, I swear to god.

4690
03:07:47,240 --> 03:07:48,000
I...

4691
03:07:48,000 --> 03:07:50,820
I am not getting arrested today.

4692
03:07:51,280 --> 03:07:52,720
I swear to god.

4693
03:07:52,860 --> 03:07:55,140
I am not getting arrested today.

4694
03:07:55,860 --> 03:07:56,540
Okay.

4695
03:07:56,920 --> 03:07:57,580
Get out.

4696
03:07:57,780 --> 03:07:58,000
Leave.

4697
03:08:00,240 --> 03:08:01,000
Okay.

4698
03:08:02,720 --> 03:08:03,260
99.

4699
03:08:08,340 --> 03:08:08,880
She...

4700
03:08:08,880 --> 03:08:11,060
She's trying to commit insurance fraud.

4701
03:08:11,620 --> 03:08:12,440
She's trying to...

4702
03:08:12,440 --> 03:08:13,420
Guys, I saw what you did.

4703
03:08:13,640 --> 03:08:14,860
I saw what you...

4704
03:08:21,900 --> 03:08:26,060
She's trying to...

4705
03:08:26,780 --> 03:08:27,440
She...

4706
03:08:27,440 --> 03:08:29,980
She literally tapped my car and ran away.

4707
03:08:29,980 --> 03:08:36,800
Okay, that bitch... Oh my god.

4708
03:08:37,660 --> 03:08:38,980
That fucker.

4709
03:08:40,700 --> 03:08:43,040
Okay, where... Okay, there it is.

4710
03:08:44,180 --> 03:08:44,680
Okay.

4711
03:08:46,060 --> 03:08:52,320
No, this is... Okay, we saved... We saved the game.

4712
03:08:53,520 --> 03:08:54,880
Oh my god.

4713
03:08:56,580 --> 03:08:57,780
All right.

4714
03:08:59,280 --> 03:09:00,980
Find a zombie car.

4715
03:09:01,480 --> 03:09:04,240
We find a zombie car.

4716
03:09:04,540 --> 03:09:04,980
Sweet.

4717
03:09:05,980 --> 03:09:08,540
We get into the vehicle.

4718
03:09:09,820 --> 03:09:11,820
Hey, I found my lost nachos.

4719
03:09:12,220 --> 03:09:12,520
All right.

4720
03:09:13,240 --> 03:09:14,880
We just need to drive to the playground.

4721
03:09:15,660 --> 03:09:19,880
We just need to... We just need to drive to the playground.

4722
03:09:20,840 --> 03:09:21,320
Yippee.

4723
03:09:26,640 --> 03:09:28,320
It's like we never crash.

4724
03:09:29,220 --> 03:09:30,140
Oh, my food.

4725
03:09:30,280 --> 03:09:31,320
It should be arriving now.

4726
03:09:31,840 --> 03:09:33,140
He just needs to call me.

4727
03:09:33,980 --> 03:09:38,120
The moment he calls me, I gotta take the car and let him up and then put my boxes outside.

4728
03:09:39,920 --> 03:09:42,800
And then be like... Oh, I now have to interact.

4729
03:09:43,100 --> 03:09:43,820
I have to sign the thing.

4730
03:09:43,940 --> 03:09:44,240
I forgot.

4731
03:09:45,580 --> 03:09:47,540
I'm like required to sign the receipt.

4732
03:09:47,860 --> 03:09:48,860
Because they're like... We delivered.

4733
03:09:49,460 --> 03:09:50,140
But it's okay.

4734
03:09:50,380 --> 03:09:51,140
I don't have to do it yet.

4735
03:09:53,340 --> 03:09:55,720
I just need to... Get over there first.

4736
03:09:58,400 --> 03:09:58,880
Okay.

4737
03:10:00,560 --> 03:10:01,440
Oh my god.

4738
03:10:01,560 --> 03:10:02,500
I forgot to...

4739
03:10:02,500 --> 03:10:03,860
Oh my god.

4740
03:10:04,020 --> 03:10:04,260
Please.

4741
03:10:04,660 --> 03:10:05,840
Please don't leave yet.

4742
03:10:06,040 --> 03:10:06,180
Please.

4743
03:10:06,880 --> 03:10:07,240
Please.

4744
03:10:08,060 --> 03:10:09,040
Fail the mission.

4745
03:10:09,300 --> 03:10:09,520
Okay.

4746
03:10:09,640 --> 03:10:11,400
We failed the mission so we can have...

4747
03:10:11,400 --> 03:10:11,820
All right.

4748
03:10:13,320 --> 03:10:14,420
We saved already.

4749
03:10:15,020 --> 03:10:15,520
Okay.

4750
03:10:15,600 --> 03:10:16,660
I'm gonna put the boxes outside.

4751
03:10:16,820 --> 03:10:17,260
Give me a sec.

4752
03:10:17,400 --> 03:10:19,400
Let me put the boxes outside first.

4753
03:11:30,370 --> 03:11:31,910
The boxes are outside.

4754
03:11:32,290 --> 03:11:33,410
I just need to wait.

4755
03:11:33,670 --> 03:11:35,210
I need to wait for...

4756
03:11:35,210 --> 03:11:37,150
I need to wait for them to call me.

4757
03:11:37,530 --> 03:11:39,210
And then we should be good.

4758
03:11:39,650 --> 03:11:41,410
Then everything will be okay.

4759
03:11:41,990 --> 03:11:42,530
Everything.

4760
03:11:43,430 --> 03:11:44,490
Oh my...

4761
03:11:44,490 --> 03:11:45,310
Everything will...

4762
03:11:45,310 --> 03:11:46,090
It was strategic.

4763
03:11:46,510 --> 03:11:47,970
Everything will be okay.

4764
03:11:48,570 --> 03:11:48,830
Everything.

4765
03:11:50,450 --> 03:11:51,090
Oh my god.

4766
03:11:51,810 --> 03:11:53,890
I'm such a mess right now.

4767
03:11:54,210 --> 03:11:57,230
I can't believe that happened to me.

4768
03:11:57,270 --> 03:12:00,050
I still can't believe that happened.

4769
03:12:00,690 --> 03:12:01,330
Like...

4770
03:12:01,330 --> 03:12:05,110
I can't believe I tapped out.

4771
03:12:05,950 --> 03:12:08,370
How could I do that?

4772
03:12:09,650 --> 03:12:10,450
How?

4773
03:12:12,770 --> 03:12:13,570
How?

4774
03:12:13,690 --> 03:12:16,550
I have to do this all over again.

4775
03:12:18,730 --> 03:12:19,470
It's fine.

4776
03:12:20,050 --> 03:12:20,730
It's fine.

4777
03:12:20,990 --> 03:12:21,690
I love this game.

4778
03:12:21,990 --> 03:12:22,970
I love this game.

4779
03:12:23,110 --> 03:12:25,050
And then the cops wanna fucking arrest me.

4780
03:12:25,190 --> 03:12:27,030
They always wanna arrest me.

4781
03:12:27,250 --> 03:12:27,770
Like...

4782
03:12:27,770 --> 03:12:29,130
I can't have a life.

4783
03:12:31,290 --> 03:12:32,530
Then we go through here.

4784
03:12:33,410 --> 03:12:34,110
Oh my god.

4785
03:12:34,230 --> 03:12:34,730
I'm like...

4786
03:12:34,730 --> 03:12:35,070
Please.

4787
03:12:35,190 --> 03:12:35,570
No child.

4788
03:12:35,790 --> 03:12:36,170
Please.

4789
03:12:39,970 --> 03:12:40,490
Please.

4790
03:12:40,490 --> 03:12:41,850
King Homer if you dare.

4791
03:12:47,870 --> 03:12:48,730
Piece of cake.

4792
03:12:52,650 --> 03:12:54,070
I was just there.

4793
03:12:54,290 --> 03:12:56,790
I would have finished the fucking...

4794
03:12:56,790 --> 03:12:59,630
Professor Frank episode by now.

4795
03:12:59,630 --> 03:13:03,110
I would have been done with Professor Frank.

4796
03:13:03,110 --> 03:13:04,590
I think I broke something.

4797
03:13:04,910 --> 03:13:05,150
Jump.

4798
03:13:05,830 --> 03:13:07,010
Oh my god.

4799
03:13:07,310 --> 03:13:08,970
It would have been over.

4800
03:13:09,250 --> 03:13:09,790
I didn't do it.

4801
03:13:09,790 --> 03:13:11,890
It would have been over.

4802
03:13:13,370 --> 03:13:15,410
I had to wait for this fucker.

4803
03:13:17,930 --> 03:13:20,470
Because he drives so goddamn slow.

4804
03:13:22,270 --> 03:13:22,750
Okay.

4805
03:13:22,850 --> 03:13:23,270
That's fine.

4806
03:13:23,490 --> 03:13:23,950
That's fine.

4807
03:13:24,110 --> 03:13:24,530
That's fine.

4808
03:13:24,550 --> 03:13:25,310
I'm okay, guys.

4809
03:13:25,970 --> 03:13:26,650
I'm okay.

4810
03:13:26,710 --> 03:13:27,750
We're just gonna get back there.

4811
03:13:29,070 --> 03:13:29,830
That's fine.

4812
03:13:30,090 --> 03:13:30,710
That's fine.

4813
03:13:31,230 --> 03:13:31,950
That's fine.

4814
03:13:32,290 --> 03:13:33,850
Sometimes you gotta hit and run.

4815
03:13:34,790 --> 03:13:35,270
Another one.

4816
03:13:35,270 --> 03:13:36,870
Sometimes life allows you to hit...

4817
03:13:36,870 --> 03:13:38,510
Hit like at least two people.

4818
03:13:38,510 --> 03:13:40,410
And that's okay.

4819
03:13:40,430 --> 03:13:42,270
What the fuck?

4820
03:13:45,410 --> 03:13:47,870
Where did he send me?

4821
03:13:48,490 --> 03:13:49,850
Nothing lasts forever.

4822
03:13:50,150 --> 03:13:52,430
The vibrations tickling my feet.

4823
03:13:52,790 --> 03:13:53,170
No!

4824
03:14:35,660 --> 03:14:37,860
Where's my crushers?

4825
03:14:38,500 --> 03:14:40,460
Where is it?

4826
03:14:40,920 --> 03:14:41,860
Check out.

4827
03:14:42,620 --> 03:14:44,420
Where's my crushers?

4828
03:14:46,240 --> 03:14:48,220
Is this your arriving?

4829
03:14:48,540 --> 03:14:49,560
Where is he?

4830
03:14:50,060 --> 03:14:51,800
He didn't call me.

4831
03:14:52,860 --> 03:14:55,220
He's like, right outside.

4832
03:14:56,080 --> 03:14:57,120
Like, the building.

4833
03:14:57,620 --> 03:15:00,680
Why is he... Where's my car?

4834
03:15:02,240 --> 03:15:06,760
Wait... No, it's the grocery place.

4835
03:15:07,520 --> 03:15:07,920
Okay.

4836
03:15:09,440 --> 03:15:10,020
Okay.

4837
03:15:10,160 --> 03:15:13,780
You gotta admit, that was so bullshit.

4838
03:15:13,780 --> 03:15:13,960
Shit.

4839
03:15:14,280 --> 03:15:20,780
Like, I... How would... Like... He fucking rose from the grave.

4840
03:15:24,540 --> 03:15:26,080
Oh my god.

4841
03:15:27,460 --> 03:15:29,160
That was actually crazy.

4842
03:15:30,120 --> 03:15:32,040
That was... I don't know why he's barking.

4843
03:15:33,320 --> 03:15:35,780
I actually don't know what he's barking about right now.

4844
03:15:35,860 --> 03:15:37,000
I don't know why he's mad.

4845
03:15:38,900 --> 03:15:42,660
I don't know... Okay, I'm gonna check the groceries.

4846
03:15:42,880 --> 03:15:43,520
I'll be right back.

4847
03:15:43,520 --> 03:15:45,520
I'm... I'm hearing...

4848
03:16:45,270 --> 03:16:46,090
News.

4849
03:16:46,490 --> 03:16:47,330
He's coming up.

4850
03:16:47,850 --> 03:16:50,330
The grocery is coming up.

4851
03:16:50,530 --> 03:16:51,430
Good news.

4852
03:16:52,030 --> 03:16:54,170
There's some good news in my life.

4853
03:16:54,670 --> 03:16:55,190
There's...

4854
03:16:57,570 --> 03:17:00,290
There's... There's some good news.

4855
03:17:00,450 --> 03:17:01,270
At least.

4856
03:17:03,810 --> 03:17:04,730
Thank God.

4857
03:17:05,450 --> 03:17:05,970
Why?

4858
03:17:06,290 --> 03:17:07,170
Why are you mad?

4859
03:17:07,810 --> 03:17:08,070
Why?

4860
03:17:08,750 --> 03:17:11,090
I don't... I'm going through... Okay.

4861
03:17:11,710 --> 03:17:13,950
The grocery man is gonna hear me crash out.

4862
03:17:14,030 --> 03:17:15,130
I don't know if I like that.

4863
03:17:15,630 --> 03:17:17,190
I... Guys, we gotta be normal.

4864
03:17:17,450 --> 03:17:21,010
I don't want him to hear... He's gonna hear me fucking crash out.

4865
03:17:21,530 --> 03:17:26,310
In my... In my... In my... We can't let that happen.

4866
03:17:27,010 --> 03:17:28,710
We are gonna be normal.

4867
03:17:29,550 --> 03:17:30,070
We're...

4868
03:17:30,070 --> 03:17:32,130
I can't let that happen.

4869
03:17:32,490 --> 03:17:34,650
We're gonna be adorable.

4870
03:17:36,070 --> 03:17:36,710
We're gonna be adorable.

4871
03:17:36,770 --> 03:17:36,790
Oh.

4872
03:17:38,350 --> 03:17:40,110
Josh, thank you for the super chat.

4873
03:17:40,270 --> 03:17:41,170
Thank you, thank you.

4874
03:17:42,290 --> 03:17:48,210
Real how relentless the cars and the games were like, damn, I thought the cops and the Simpsons were being useless.

4875
03:17:48,430 --> 03:17:50,490
Thank you for the super chat.

4876
03:17:51,110 --> 03:17:52,670
Thank you, thank you.

4877
03:17:54,150 --> 03:17:55,270
Oh, God.

4878
03:17:56,430 --> 03:18:00,690
I can't believe that this rose out of the grave like that.

4879
03:18:01,070 --> 03:18:01,610
I

4880
03:18:06,050 --> 03:18:07,810
can't believe it.

4881
03:18:08,630 --> 03:18:10,330
Why did this happen to me?

4882
03:18:16,230 --> 03:18:19,350
Okay, we're normal people.

4883
03:18:19,810 --> 03:18:20,710
We're normal.

4884
03:18:21,610 --> 03:18:23,550
I think... Oh, he's outside.

4885
03:18:23,750 --> 03:18:24,110
Oh, we're back.

4886
03:19:50,780 --> 03:19:53,080
Okay, I'm back again.

4887
03:19:53,420 --> 03:19:54,120
I'm back.

4888
03:19:55,660 --> 03:19:57,380
I got my cold cuts.

4889
03:19:57,620 --> 03:20:00,040
I got my cold cuts.

4890
03:20:01,180 --> 03:20:02,360
Let's do this.

4891
03:20:02,660 --> 03:20:05,000
I don't have to worry about groceries, at least.

4892
03:20:08,440 --> 03:20:09,300
That's good.

4893
03:20:09,520 --> 03:20:10,500
Alright, we're locked in.

4894
03:20:10,920 --> 03:20:12,340
We're locked in for real.

4895
03:20:13,040 --> 03:20:13,820
This is it.

4896
03:20:14,540 --> 03:20:16,320
I love this game.

4897
03:20:16,780 --> 03:20:18,020
Oh, my God.

4898
03:20:18,140 --> 03:20:19,540
I love this game so much.

4899
03:20:21,260 --> 03:20:24,340
If I say it enough times, it might become true.

4900
03:20:25,740 --> 03:20:28,840
Let's grab the screwdriver real quick.

4901
03:20:30,740 --> 03:20:33,900
No, it's cold cuts, orange juice, and lemonade.

4902
03:20:34,660 --> 03:20:35,420
And bread.

4903
03:20:36,080 --> 03:20:37,520
And bread.

4904
03:20:39,420 --> 03:20:41,000
Oh, my God.

4905
03:20:41,460 --> 03:20:44,440
Please, just bring me out of my misery.

4906
03:20:44,620 --> 03:20:47,260
Please, just... I hope you arrest me.

4907
03:20:47,260 --> 03:20:48,260
Fuck it.

4908
03:20:48,380 --> 03:20:48,460
Fuck it.

4909
03:20:48,460 --> 03:20:49,680
I committed too much crime.

4910
03:20:50,040 --> 03:20:52,300
I was having it too good for too long.

4911
03:20:52,620 --> 03:20:54,400
I hope you arrest me.

4912
03:20:55,700 --> 03:20:57,580
Alright, it's fine.

4913
03:20:59,040 --> 03:21:00,780
Oh, my God.

4914
03:21:00,780 --> 03:21:02,800
Oh, my God.

4915
03:21:03,120 --> 03:21:03,280
No!

4916
03:21:06,100 --> 03:21:07,180
Oh, my God.

4917
03:21:07,180 --> 03:21:07,180
No!

4918
03:21:10,220 --> 03:21:11,700
Oh, my God.

4919
03:21:12,100 --> 03:21:14,960
These cops won't let me breathe.

4920
03:21:15,940 --> 03:21:18,840
This is why... This is why zombies don't deserve rights.

4921
03:21:19,160 --> 03:21:20,560
This is exactly why.

4922
03:21:26,720 --> 03:21:28,240
Oh, my God.

4923
03:21:28,400 --> 03:21:29,280
Just restart this.

4924
03:21:29,580 --> 03:21:30,260
Just drive.

4925
03:21:31,300 --> 03:21:32,460
Just drive.

4926
03:21:38,560 --> 03:21:39,180
Alright.

4927
03:21:39,180 --> 03:21:40,080
Here we go.

4928
03:21:40,240 --> 03:21:40,640
This time.

4929
03:21:41,380 --> 03:21:41,660
Okay.

4930
03:21:41,880 --> 03:21:42,900
I'm locked in now, for real.

4931
03:21:44,580 --> 03:21:45,820
I'm locked in.

4932
03:21:46,760 --> 03:21:47,600
Get out.

4933
03:21:48,700 --> 03:21:49,640
Get out.

4934
03:21:49,640 --> 03:21:52,180
You're driving the wrong side of the road.

4935
03:21:52,360 --> 03:21:52,560
Leave.

4936
03:21:55,160 --> 03:21:55,960
Coming through.

4937
03:21:56,200 --> 03:21:56,480
Alright.

4938
03:21:56,680 --> 03:21:56,960
Nice.

4939
03:21:58,180 --> 03:21:59,360
And that's our way for him.

4940
03:22:00,400 --> 03:22:03,160
So he can chase up... So he can catch up a little bit.

4941
03:22:04,380 --> 03:22:04,720
Come on.

4942
03:22:04,800 --> 03:22:04,980
Alright.

4943
03:22:05,020 --> 03:22:05,280
Nice.

4944
03:22:05,900 --> 03:22:07,080
He's right behind me.

4945
03:22:08,700 --> 03:22:10,360
That means I can do this now.

4946
03:22:11,240 --> 03:22:11,760
Ow!

4947
03:22:12,160 --> 03:22:12,680
Okay.

4948
03:22:12,740 --> 03:22:13,700
I can do this now.

4949
03:22:15,820 --> 03:22:18,040
That means I can do this now.

4950
03:22:18,600 --> 03:22:18,980
Woohoo!

4951
03:22:19,940 --> 03:22:20,160
Alright.

4952
03:22:23,620 --> 03:22:26,060
And then we have to go through this goddamn cemetery.

4953
03:22:28,180 --> 03:22:28,820
Weeee!

4954
03:22:29,460 --> 03:22:30,100
Hehehehe.

4955
03:22:30,200 --> 03:22:30,220
Ow!

4956
03:22:30,220 --> 03:22:30,700
My nose!

4957
03:22:32,660 --> 03:22:34,100
And then after that...

4958
03:22:35,440 --> 03:22:39,020
He's gonna go through the cleanest place right here.

4959
03:22:39,780 --> 03:22:40,580
Don't worry.

4960
03:22:40,700 --> 03:22:43,440
I've got the whole place memorized now.

4961
03:22:44,380 --> 03:22:45,860
Oh my god.

4962
03:22:46,120 --> 03:22:49,740
If I can, like, drive through this rocky-ass fucking road.

4963
03:22:52,880 --> 03:22:53,500
Okay.

4964
03:22:54,280 --> 03:22:55,780
And then from here.

4965
03:22:58,780 --> 03:22:59,400
Weeee!

4966
03:23:02,060 --> 03:23:02,680
Please.

4967
03:23:03,380 --> 03:23:03,960
Please.

4968
03:23:04,640 --> 03:23:05,640
Oh, thank god.

4969
03:23:06,620 --> 03:23:07,480
Thank god.

4970
03:23:07,780 --> 03:23:07,980
Okay.

4971
03:23:08,160 --> 03:23:09,440
Now we're back to where we were.

4972
03:23:10,020 --> 03:23:10,560
Now...

4973
03:23:10,560 --> 03:23:12,460
Now we're back to where we were.

4974
03:23:12,460 --> 03:23:14,160
We finally did it.

4975
03:23:14,220 --> 03:23:15,120
We finally...

4976
03:23:15,120 --> 03:23:15,900
That's fine.

4977
03:23:16,260 --> 03:23:17,240
I'm already broke.

4978
03:23:17,440 --> 03:23:18,300
That's fine.

4979
03:23:18,920 --> 03:23:19,440
That...

4980
03:23:20,160 --> 03:23:21,320
That's fine.

4981
03:23:23,360 --> 03:23:24,800
I'm already broke.

4982
03:23:24,800 --> 03:23:25,640
It's fine.

4983
03:23:25,660 --> 03:23:26,800
I forgot to save.

4984
03:23:27,060 --> 03:23:28,000
But it's okay.

4985
03:23:29,560 --> 03:23:30,420
It's okay.

4986
03:23:30,540 --> 03:23:31,480
I forgot to save.

4987
03:23:31,660 --> 03:23:32,300
But it's okay.

4988
03:23:33,180 --> 03:23:33,700
Oh boy.

4989
03:23:34,580 --> 03:23:35,660
Famous last words.

4990
03:23:36,160 --> 03:23:38,780
Surely, that's not going to fuck me over again, right?

4991
03:23:39,040 --> 03:23:39,240
Guys?

4992
03:23:41,400 --> 03:23:42,200
It's okay.

4993
03:23:43,260 --> 03:23:44,040
It's okay.

4994
03:23:44,200 --> 03:23:46,360
I'm feeling so okay right now.

4995
03:23:47,420 --> 03:23:49,880
Oh my god, I should not be doing that.

4996
03:23:50,180 --> 03:23:52,000
I should not be doing any of that.

4997
03:23:52,380 --> 03:23:55,080
I should not be... They're just right there!

4998
03:23:57,840 --> 03:23:59,500
Oh my god, please.

4999
03:24:01,360 --> 03:24:01,960
Please!

5000
03:24:04,060 --> 03:24:04,940
It's fine.

5001
03:24:05,620 --> 03:24:06,200
It's fine.

5002
03:24:06,560 --> 03:24:09,220
And then we have it perfectly centered.

5003
03:24:53,640 --> 03:24:54,780
That's okay.

5004
03:24:55,180 --> 03:24:58,560
We have it perfectly centered next time.

5005
03:25:00,320 --> 03:25:01,580
Don't worry.

5006
03:25:01,940 --> 03:25:04,360
The next time, it will be...

5007
03:25:04,440 --> 03:25:05,760
Perfectly centered.

5008
03:25:07,700 --> 03:25:11,140
We'll have the next time to do that.

5009
03:25:12,300 --> 03:25:13,960
I hate his car.

5010
03:25:14,240 --> 03:25:17,380
I hate his car so much.

5011
03:25:17,800 --> 03:25:20,480
It is so hard to drive.

5012
03:25:20,920 --> 03:25:23,620
It is so hard to have...

5013
03:25:23,620 --> 03:25:24,600
Alright.

5014
03:25:25,520 --> 03:25:26,920
Perfectly centered.

5015
03:25:27,660 --> 03:25:28,540
Right here.

5016
03:25:29,160 --> 03:25:31,620
There's no... There is...

5017
03:26:02,870 --> 03:26:03,470
Okay.

5018
03:26:03,470 --> 03:26:04,270
Let's tap.

5019
03:26:04,670 --> 03:26:04,990
Let's tap.

5020
03:26:05,130 --> 03:26:05,990
We figured it out.

5021
03:26:06,370 --> 03:26:07,910
We figured it out.

5022
03:26:08,610 --> 03:26:10,470
Guys, we know what to do this time.

5023
03:26:10,650 --> 03:26:12,210
We can't fuck it up a third time.

5024
03:26:13,190 --> 03:26:13,510
Third time?

5025
03:26:13,650 --> 03:26:15,910
You know they say, JEFF the truth is the charm, chat.

5026
03:26:16,430 --> 03:26:19,290
Third time is the charm, Dragoons.

5027
03:26:19,810 --> 03:26:20,870
That's what they say.

5028
03:26:21,090 --> 03:26:22,370
They never lie about that.

5029
03:26:23,470 --> 03:26:26,810
They always say, the third time is when magic happens.

5030
03:26:30,830 --> 03:26:34,130
The third time is when magic happens, guys.

5031
03:26:39,130 --> 03:26:39,650
Okay.

5032
03:26:39,650 --> 03:26:40,610
Alright, right here.

5033
03:26:41,130 --> 03:26:42,550
Okay, we go slower this time.

5034
03:26:42,930 --> 03:26:43,810
We go slower.

5035
03:26:45,770 --> 03:26:47,510
We can go a little slower.

5036
03:26:47,950 --> 03:26:49,110
Why is Carl normal?

5037
03:26:50,930 --> 03:26:52,390
Okay, there we go.

5038
03:26:52,650 --> 03:26:53,410
See, I told you!

5039
03:26:53,650 --> 03:26:54,790
Third time's the charm!

5040
03:26:59,970 --> 03:27:01,050
Okay, there we go.

5041
03:27:04,670 --> 03:27:05,150
Okay.

5042
03:27:06,170 --> 03:27:08,370
No, no, no, no.

5043
03:27:08,550 --> 03:27:09,630
Do not hit me, please.

5044
03:27:10,230 --> 03:27:11,450
Do not, do not hit me.

5045
03:27:11,610 --> 03:27:14,210
You can arrest me, but don't hit me, please.

5046
03:27:14,990 --> 03:27:16,230
That's all I ask.

5047
03:27:17,250 --> 03:27:20,130
I will let you arrest me, just don't hit me.

5048
03:27:20,370 --> 03:27:24,130
I have nothing else to lose but my dignity.

5049
03:27:24,430 --> 03:27:25,250
No, I swear!

5050
03:27:46,030 --> 03:27:48,790
It's not even my fault!

5051
03:27:49,430 --> 03:27:52,490
He hit me!

5052
03:27:55,150 --> 03:27:57,010
He hit me.

5053
03:27:58,870 --> 03:28:01,210
No, this is how we restart.

5054
03:28:02,190 --> 03:28:03,710
I don't care.

5055
03:28:04,290 --> 03:28:08,770
This is how we are gonna restart for the rest of our lives.

5056
03:28:08,770 --> 03:28:09,110
Guys!

5057
03:28:10,610 --> 03:28:12,450
It's just easier.

5058
03:28:12,810 --> 03:28:15,830
It lets me process everything easier.

5059
03:28:16,210 --> 03:28:17,210
This audience must be part flubber.

5060
03:28:17,390 --> 03:28:18,730
Looks harder than it is.

5061
03:28:19,010 --> 03:28:22,550
It allows me to process my- my anger.

5062
03:28:23,850 --> 03:28:25,730
I am evil Homer!

5063
03:28:26,150 --> 03:28:27,430
I am evil Homer!

5064
03:28:27,430 --> 03:28:28,670
Alright, here we go.

5065
03:28:29,010 --> 03:28:29,710
Here we go.

5066
03:28:33,620 --> 03:28:34,960
I swear to God.

5067
03:28:35,720 --> 03:28:41,760
I think I would have finished the game by now if- if I didn't- if I didn't ult tap.

5068
03:28:42,020 --> 03:28:43,960
I would have finished the game.

5069
03:28:44,980 --> 03:28:46,560
It would have been over.

5070
03:28:49,520 --> 03:28:51,500
Oh my God, at least like I learned that.

5071
03:28:51,820 --> 03:28:53,320
Guys, I learned that though.

5072
03:28:53,780 --> 03:28:55,080
But like- Oh my God!

5073
03:28:55,300 --> 03:28:55,880
Oh my God!

5074
03:28:56,180 --> 03:28:57,340
Everybody's already dead anyway!

5075
03:28:57,600 --> 03:28:59,820
You don't have an actual job, coroner!

5076
03:28:59,820 --> 03:29:01,960
Where am I gonna put all these?

5077
03:29:02,220 --> 03:29:02,400
Alright.

5078
03:29:02,500 --> 03:29:03,140
A good line.

5079
03:29:04,120 --> 03:29:05,020
Be nice.

5080
03:29:06,440 --> 03:29:08,900
Like who are the dead people in the city?

5081
03:29:09,140 --> 03:29:10,440
They're all dead anyway!

5082
03:29:12,560 --> 03:29:14,460
There's no more dead people in the city anyway.

5083
03:29:14,660 --> 03:29:17,460
So I don't know who you're fucking trying to cater to.

5084
03:29:21,020 --> 03:29:21,540
Eh.

5085
03:29:21,980 --> 03:29:22,780
Springfield Elementary.

5086
03:29:23,160 --> 03:29:23,740
I see it.

5087
03:29:23,960 --> 03:29:25,360
I see Springfield Elementary.

5088
03:29:25,360 --> 03:29:27,200
It's nearly right there.

5089
03:29:30,920 --> 03:29:32,280
Oh my God, it's right there.

5090
03:29:32,500 --> 03:29:35,340
Because I didn't have a good, nice alien craft.

5091
03:29:35,600 --> 03:29:38,680
Now to just get out of the- Oh my God, that's fire.

5092
03:29:39,160 --> 03:29:40,000
That's- Goodbye!

5093
03:29:40,700 --> 03:29:42,640
Goodbye, Professor Frank!

5094
03:29:43,200 --> 03:29:43,700
Goodbye!

5095
03:29:49,420 --> 03:29:51,200
We did it!

5096
03:29:51,540 --> 03:29:51,980
Goodbye!

5097
03:29:53,020 --> 03:29:54,480
We did it!

5098
03:29:54,480 --> 03:29:55,680
Goodbye!

5099
03:29:57,040 --> 03:30:03,420
Your sacrifice was for the greater good and for my sanity!

5100
03:30:04,260 --> 03:30:05,700
Alright, here we go.

5101
03:30:05,840 --> 03:30:07,120
To the school we go.

5102
03:30:08,820 --> 03:30:09,200
Oh!

5103
03:30:12,220 --> 03:30:13,340
Here we go.

5104
03:30:15,160 --> 03:30:17,220
Alright, to the school we go.

5105
03:30:18,580 --> 03:30:20,320
You should tab up now.

5106
03:30:20,660 --> 03:30:22,560
It would be funny and you know it.

5107
03:30:22,940 --> 03:30:24,700
And I thank you for the super chat.

5108
03:30:25,060 --> 03:30:26,540
Lisa, what do you want, Lisa?

5109
03:30:26,780 --> 03:30:28,780
I need to find some nuclear waste and fast.

5110
03:30:29,040 --> 03:30:30,580
Why don't you ask Mr. Burns?

5111
03:30:30,860 --> 03:30:34,380
His buried nuclear waste has poisoned Springfield for years now.

5112
03:30:34,380 --> 03:30:35,980
Oh, is that the parkour area?

5113
03:30:36,660 --> 03:30:37,500
He'll save us.

5114
03:30:37,660 --> 03:30:39,880
Thank goodness for nuclear waste.

5115
03:30:41,400 --> 03:30:44,320
Find a source of nuclear waste before the time runs out?

5116
03:30:44,860 --> 03:30:45,380
Oh, shit.

5117
03:30:48,720 --> 03:30:49,380
Oh, shit.

5118
03:30:49,480 --> 03:30:52,980
Oh, shit.

5119
03:30:53,220 --> 03:30:53,340
Okay.

5120
03:30:53,460 --> 03:30:54,420
I gotta get my car.

5121
03:30:55,160 --> 03:30:55,560
Please!

5122
03:30:55,700 --> 03:30:56,760
I don't have my car!

5123
03:30:57,580 --> 03:30:58,840
Can you come and get me?

5124
03:30:58,960 --> 03:30:59,180
Alright.

5125
03:30:59,320 --> 03:31:00,380
I'll pay you in back, Rob.

5126
03:31:00,520 --> 03:31:03,900
I wanted to cheat the system and just not get a car until like, you know.

5127
03:31:04,120 --> 03:31:07,820
You know my- my usual thing where- I- Oh my god!

5128
03:31:07,880 --> 03:31:09,220
Who let you drive?

5129
03:31:10,060 --> 03:31:11,600
Who gave you a license?

5130
03:31:15,100 --> 03:31:20,760
I want to do that thing where like, I just walk over there because it just said get in a vehicle, but the game knew.

5131
03:31:20,980 --> 03:31:23,100
The game knew what I wanted to do.

5132
03:31:23,440 --> 03:31:24,260
Uh-oh.

5133
03:31:24,280 --> 03:31:25,620
Hit that black car again.

5134
03:31:26,100 --> 03:31:26,320
Ooh.

5135
03:31:26,320 --> 03:31:27,160
Are you serious?

5136
03:31:28,120 --> 03:31:30,240
Combined with the tenacity of a level boss.

5137
03:31:30,540 --> 03:31:32,260
Are you fucking kidding me?

5138
03:31:32,260 --> 03:31:35,400
I have to get away from you now too?

5139
03:31:37,340 --> 03:31:38,620
Oh my god.

5140
03:31:38,680 --> 03:31:38,880
Hey!

5141
03:31:38,960 --> 03:31:39,800
I didn't deal with the cops!

5142
03:31:42,520 --> 03:31:43,520
Okay, that's fine.

5143
03:31:46,560 --> 03:31:46,960
Alright.

5144
03:31:48,860 --> 03:31:50,400
Learn to drive, dumbass.

5145
03:31:50,580 --> 03:31:50,860
Alright.

5146
03:31:51,120 --> 03:31:51,480
It's fine.

5147
03:31:52,360 --> 03:31:53,780
Power plant is in front of me.

5148
03:31:56,500 --> 03:31:57,100
It's fine.

5149
03:31:57,420 --> 03:31:57,700
It's fine.

5150
03:31:57,880 --> 03:31:58,440
Oh my god.

5151
03:31:58,920 --> 03:31:59,700
I don't care.

5152
03:32:00,060 --> 03:32:00,340
I don't care.

5153
03:32:00,540 --> 03:32:01,860
Just put me in the right path.

5154
03:32:02,080 --> 03:32:02,820
Where is it?

5155
03:32:05,060 --> 03:32:05,760
Oh my god.

5156
03:32:05,860 --> 03:32:06,480
My shortcut.

5157
03:32:08,780 --> 03:32:09,400
It's fine.

5158
03:32:09,560 --> 03:32:10,760
That gives me a fresh start.

5159
03:32:13,520 --> 03:32:15,020
Get out of my way, jerkass.

5160
03:32:16,580 --> 03:32:17,140
Okay.

5161
03:32:17,480 --> 03:32:18,280
We can make it.

5162
03:32:18,960 --> 03:32:20,140
It's literally right there.

5163
03:32:21,540 --> 03:32:22,600
It's right there.

5164
03:32:22,920 --> 03:32:24,000
We can make it.

5165
03:32:26,460 --> 03:32:27,420
Oh my god.

5166
03:32:27,540 --> 03:32:28,160
Get me out of here.

5167
03:32:28,400 --> 03:32:28,540
Okay.

5168
03:32:29,020 --> 03:32:29,340
Nice.

5169
03:32:29,660 --> 03:32:29,980
Alright.

5170
03:32:30,100 --> 03:32:30,560
Parkour.

5171
03:32:31,880 --> 03:32:32,440
Parkour.

5172
03:32:33,080 --> 03:32:34,300
We've done this before.

5173
03:32:34,300 --> 03:32:35,360
We know the path.

5174
03:32:37,760 --> 03:32:38,320
Okay.

5175
03:32:39,660 --> 03:32:41,540
We've done this parkour before.

5176
03:32:42,260 --> 03:32:44,040
I've played these games before.

5177
03:32:44,760 --> 03:32:46,300
We don't need this.

5178
03:32:46,820 --> 03:32:48,120
We don't need this.

5179
03:32:48,120 --> 03:32:48,220
We don't need these.

5180
03:32:48,340 --> 03:32:48,680
These are just...

5181
03:32:48,680 --> 03:32:50,340
That's just money for the cops anyway.

5182
03:32:50,780 --> 03:32:51,140
Well, I need disco nap.

5183
03:32:57,840 --> 03:32:59,460
It's just bail money.

5184
03:33:00,460 --> 03:33:02,580
I remember the path.

5185
03:33:02,580 --> 03:33:02,660
I...

5186
03:33:03,880 --> 03:33:04,440
Two...

5187
03:33:04,440 --> 03:33:04,920
Thanks.

5188
03:33:05,340 --> 03:33:05,660
Over...

5189
03:33:06,440 --> 03:33:07,220
Don't wait.

5190
03:33:09,960 --> 03:33:11,600
Don't worry, Mr. Burns.

5191
03:33:12,440 --> 03:33:13,560
I remember.

5192
03:33:16,560 --> 03:33:17,120
Yeah.

5193
03:33:18,640 --> 03:33:20,380
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

5194
03:33:21,820 --> 03:33:22,840
That's fucking right!

5195
03:33:22,840 --> 03:33:23,300
I remember!

5196
03:33:37,960 --> 03:33:43,920
I am very determined when I'm very angry.

5197
03:33:53,300 --> 03:33:54,040
Oh, nice.

5198
03:33:58,160 --> 03:33:59,560
Oh, shit.

5199
03:34:00,960 --> 03:34:01,620
Damn.

5200
03:34:02,860 --> 03:34:04,160
Larry delivered new cohesus.

5201
03:34:04,320 --> 03:34:05,420
Don't let the time run out.

5202
03:34:06,760 --> 03:34:09,180
Okay, where do I... Okay, get into your vehicle.

5203
03:34:09,860 --> 03:34:10,940
Let me down.

5204
03:34:11,540 --> 03:34:11,680
Okay.

5205
03:34:12,440 --> 03:34:13,680
Fast pass.

5206
03:34:14,080 --> 03:34:14,760
Fast travel.

5207
03:34:15,060 --> 03:34:16,020
Where's my car?

5208
03:34:16,960 --> 03:34:18,680
I don't wear my... Oh, there's my car.

5209
03:34:19,060 --> 03:34:20,840
Oh, my car is not okay.

5210
03:34:24,260 --> 03:34:25,580
Okay, right here.

5211
03:34:27,720 --> 03:34:28,320
Drive.

5212
03:34:28,580 --> 03:34:29,320
Wait, what?

5213
03:34:29,460 --> 03:34:31,340
And then I have to go... Oh, my God.

5214
03:34:31,740 --> 03:34:32,700
Are you serious?

5215
03:34:33,600 --> 03:34:35,280
At the... Oh, my God.

5216
03:34:35,280 --> 03:34:36,420
I have to do that.

5217
03:34:36,620 --> 03:34:38,160
I can't even see.

5218
03:34:38,760 --> 03:34:46,000
I... I have to... I can't... I can't even see.

5219
03:34:46,020 --> 03:34:49,980
I have to do that all over again.

5220
03:34:50,760 --> 03:34:52,820
You beat us not over.

5221
03:34:55,560 --> 03:34:56,780
Oh, no.

5222
03:34:57,160 --> 03:34:58,040
This is worse.

5223
03:34:58,200 --> 03:34:59,760
I can't even see.

5224
03:35:00,140 --> 03:35:01,720
Where I'm driving.

5225
03:35:04,400 --> 03:35:05,480
Oh, no.

5226
03:35:05,740 --> 03:35:06,500
No, please.

5227
03:35:07,260 --> 03:35:08,940
Please, not the cops.

5228
03:35:09,780 --> 03:35:10,020
No.

5229
03:35:10,020 --> 03:35:11,020
Oh, no.

5230
03:35:11,020 --> 03:35:11,020
No.

5231
03:35:11,020 --> 03:35:13,300
The important thing is I'm not imagining these guys.

5232
03:35:14,440 --> 03:35:14,980
No.

5233
03:35:15,180 --> 03:35:15,580
No.

5234
03:35:15,940 --> 03:35:16,480
Oh, no.

5235
03:35:16,480 --> 03:35:17,000
Oh, no.

5236
03:35:19,520 --> 03:35:20,060
No.

5237
03:35:20,060 --> 03:35:21,640
I wish I had a dog with a saddle.

5238
03:35:22,580 --> 03:35:24,020
Okay, that's a lot soon.

5239
03:35:24,080 --> 03:35:24,600
Wait.

5240
03:35:41,560 --> 03:35:43,060
Can you come and get me?

5241
03:35:43,340 --> 03:35:44,900
I'll pay you in the back room.

5242
03:35:45,080 --> 03:35:45,440
Oh, my God.

5243
03:35:46,700 --> 03:35:49,880
It just explodes like that.

5244
03:35:51,200 --> 03:35:53,920
Alright, let's just get the waste back.

5245
03:35:54,220 --> 03:35:56,680
Let's just... let's just get it back.

5246
03:35:58,240 --> 03:36:02,220
It can't... it will still grab me time to deliver.

5247
03:36:03,700 --> 03:36:09,600
I can't believe my car explodes after they arrested me.

5248
03:36:10,100 --> 03:36:14,260
It's like... it's like they just... they want to add a little extra.

5249
03:36:18,400 --> 03:36:21,720
They just wanted to add a little extra to my pain.

5250
03:36:22,360 --> 03:36:24,080
It was just not enough.

5251
03:36:28,820 --> 03:36:30,080
It was not enough.

5252
03:36:30,260 --> 03:36:32,300
They were like, you had it too good for too long.

5253
03:36:32,660 --> 03:36:36,000
All those opportunities you're getting, we want you to suffer now.

5254
03:36:38,960 --> 03:36:39,980
Alright, it's okay.

5255
03:36:40,060 --> 03:36:41,060
At least I can see now.

5256
03:36:41,220 --> 03:36:42,980
At least I know where the fuck I'm going.

5257
03:36:54,580 --> 03:36:59,720
Alright, time to get my... time to get my nuclear waste.

5258
03:37:09,660 --> 03:37:13,600
How did that happen?

5259
03:37:14,320 --> 03:37:16,280
I don't understand.

5260
03:37:17,080 --> 03:37:18,660
I don't understand.

5261
03:37:18,660 --> 03:37:21,020
I don't understand.

5262
03:37:21,240 --> 03:37:21,360
I don't understand.

5263
03:37:23,640 --> 03:37:25,480
That was barely an impact.

5264
03:37:27,100 --> 03:37:29,020
It was like a love tap.

5265
03:37:30,040 --> 03:37:31,600
I don't understand.

5266
03:37:38,980 --> 03:37:40,420
We need another car.

5267
03:37:40,760 --> 03:37:41,880
We need another car.

5268
03:37:42,040 --> 03:37:43,160
This car is not it.

5269
03:37:43,160 --> 03:37:45,140
This car is not it.

5270
03:37:45,140 --> 03:37:46,120
Guys, we need...

5271
03:37:46,120 --> 03:37:48,100
We need another car.

5272
03:37:48,580 --> 03:37:50,180
We absolutely...

5273
03:37:50,180 --> 03:37:51,160
We absolutely...

5274
03:37:51,740 --> 03:37:52,760
Doki, I know.

5275
03:37:53,020 --> 03:37:53,480
I know.

5276
03:37:54,220 --> 03:37:54,940
I know.

5277
03:37:54,940 --> 03:37:55,020
I know.

5278
03:37:55,140 --> 03:37:56,240
We need another car.

5279
03:37:56,660 --> 03:37:57,160
We...

5280
03:37:57,160 --> 03:37:57,840
We...

5281
03:37:57,840 --> 03:37:59,180
We cannot...

5282
03:37:59,180 --> 03:38:01,140
That car was not it.

5283
03:38:01,900 --> 03:38:02,580
That...

5284
03:38:04,320 --> 03:38:06,920
That car was just not it.

5285
03:38:07,180 --> 03:38:07,980
In the end.

5286
03:38:08,700 --> 03:38:09,540
Oh my god.

5287
03:38:09,700 --> 03:38:10,280
What is tough?

5288
03:38:15,470 --> 03:38:17,290
We just need another car.

5289
03:38:18,030 --> 03:38:18,450
We...

5290
03:38:18,450 --> 03:38:20,790
We just need...

5291
03:38:22,590 --> 03:38:24,470
Just need another car.

5292
03:38:25,550 --> 03:38:26,810
Can you come and get me?

5293
03:38:26,990 --> 03:38:27,470
Wait, no.

5294
03:38:27,530 --> 03:38:28,570
That car is the worst one.

5295
03:38:28,750 --> 03:38:29,110
I forgot.

5296
03:38:29,470 --> 03:38:30,730
Marge's car fucking sucks.

5297
03:38:30,730 --> 03:38:31,570
You thought of me first.

5298
03:38:32,210 --> 03:38:33,890
Unless, of course, you missed the island.

5299
03:38:34,730 --> 03:38:35,770
I don't know.

5300
03:38:37,850 --> 03:38:38,390
Okay.

5301
03:38:38,530 --> 03:38:38,990
We'll try it.

5302
03:38:39,130 --> 03:38:39,770
We'll try this.

5303
03:38:42,450 --> 03:38:42,990
Surely...

5304
03:38:42,990 --> 03:38:44,150
This won't be as bad.

5305
03:38:46,150 --> 03:38:46,610
Surely.

5306
03:38:52,920 --> 03:38:53,460
Okay.

5307
03:38:54,360 --> 03:38:55,560
Back at it again.

5308
03:38:58,960 --> 03:38:59,500
Surely...

5309
03:38:59,500 --> 03:39:00,520
Surely...

5310
03:39:00,520 --> 03:39:02,020
It won't be as bad.

5311
03:39:06,620 --> 03:39:07,140
Alright.

5312
03:39:07,620 --> 03:39:08,200
That's fine.

5313
03:39:09,400 --> 03:39:10,180
That's fine.

5314
03:39:10,360 --> 03:39:10,880
Oh, okay.

5315
03:39:11,100 --> 03:39:11,240
We...

5316
03:39:11,240 --> 03:39:12,280
We thread the needle there.

5317
03:39:13,760 --> 03:39:14,280
Oh!

5318
03:39:14,440 --> 03:39:15,060
That's fine.

5319
03:39:15,260 --> 03:39:15,780
That's fine.

5320
03:39:17,060 --> 03:39:18,380
Just a little love tap.

5321
03:39:18,620 --> 03:39:19,260
Right there.

5322
03:39:19,740 --> 03:39:20,460
They liked it.

5323
03:39:23,360 --> 03:39:24,200
Move away.

5324
03:39:24,340 --> 03:39:24,700
Move away.

5325
03:39:24,700 --> 03:39:25,380
That's right.

5326
03:39:25,540 --> 03:39:25,820
That's right.

5327
03:39:25,900 --> 03:39:27,060
Just another little love tap.

5328
03:39:27,380 --> 03:39:28,160
They liked it.

5329
03:39:29,780 --> 03:39:30,300
Okay.

5330
03:39:33,620 --> 03:39:34,140
Alright.

5331
03:39:34,260 --> 03:39:35,260
We don't go too fast.

5332
03:39:36,960 --> 03:39:37,480
Nice.

5333
03:39:38,000 --> 03:39:38,380
Alright.

5334
03:39:39,740 --> 03:39:41,060
And off we go.

5335
03:39:43,440 --> 03:39:43,960
Okay.

5336
03:39:48,990 --> 03:39:50,910
Oh, my car was not okay.

5337
03:39:50,910 --> 03:39:52,150
I didn't even notice that.

5338
03:39:52,330 --> 03:39:53,250
I thought...

5339
03:39:53,250 --> 03:39:56,270
For some reason, I thought the smoke was part of my...

5340
03:39:57,110 --> 03:39:58,430
Was just part of the car.

5341
03:39:58,570 --> 03:39:59,310
I don't know why.

5342
03:40:03,390 --> 03:40:04,190
I just...

5343
03:40:06,930 --> 03:40:07,670
I don't know.

5344
03:40:07,950 --> 03:40:09,570
I've been through too much right now.

5345
03:40:10,210 --> 03:40:11,370
I've been through so much.

5346
03:40:11,470 --> 03:40:12,770
Nothing makes sense to me anymore.

5347
03:40:14,110 --> 03:40:15,630
It was like that when I got here.

5348
03:40:17,530 --> 03:40:18,150
Oh, my God.

5349
03:40:18,250 --> 03:40:18,690
It's right there.

5350
03:40:19,250 --> 03:40:20,050
It's right there.

5351
03:40:22,570 --> 03:40:23,350
Oh, my God.

5352
03:40:23,490 --> 03:40:23,890
Go in.

5353
03:40:25,510 --> 03:40:25,910
Goodbye.

5354
03:40:27,430 --> 03:40:27,830
Goodbye.

5355
03:40:35,550 --> 03:40:37,090
Oh, talk to Snake.

5356
03:40:37,470 --> 03:40:37,630
Okay.

5357
03:40:37,930 --> 03:40:38,990
I don't have a car.

5358
03:40:39,590 --> 03:40:40,310
Let me see.

5359
03:40:43,410 --> 03:40:43,890
Okay.

5360
03:40:44,050 --> 03:40:46,890
Time for the daily trip of taking nuclear waste to playground.

5361
03:40:47,730 --> 03:40:48,070
Robin.

5362
03:40:48,430 --> 03:40:49,590
Thank you for the super chat.

5363
03:40:49,750 --> 03:40:50,010
Thank you.

5364
03:40:50,170 --> 03:40:50,630
Thank you.

5365
03:40:51,830 --> 03:40:52,310
Hello.

5366
03:40:52,910 --> 03:40:53,090
Wait.

5367
03:40:53,130 --> 03:40:54,190
Let's talk to groundskeeper.

5368
03:40:55,290 --> 03:40:57,930
If anything, there's someone more crazy than me.

5369
03:40:58,090 --> 03:40:59,330
I'll burn me, haggis.

5370
03:41:00,450 --> 03:41:02,390
Unless you be from the sweepstakes.

5371
03:41:02,610 --> 03:41:03,210
So do.

5372
03:41:03,930 --> 03:41:04,490
Wow.

5373
03:41:04,850 --> 03:41:05,310
Imagine.

5374
03:41:05,590 --> 03:41:07,290
Me getting carjacked.

5375
03:41:07,510 --> 03:41:08,990
With a total switcheroo.

5376
03:41:09,570 --> 03:41:10,010
Just go.

5377
03:41:10,210 --> 03:41:11,890
What'll you do if I don't?

5378
03:41:12,050 --> 03:41:13,650
Flip you the bird.

5379
03:41:14,090 --> 03:41:15,130
Okay, don't get tricky.

5380
03:41:15,290 --> 03:41:15,390
Get in.

5381
03:41:16,250 --> 03:41:17,450
We're only allowed one.

5382
03:41:18,450 --> 03:41:19,450
Every season.

5383
03:41:20,450 --> 03:41:21,470
Oh my God.

5384
03:41:21,750 --> 03:41:22,330
Not again.

5385
03:41:23,250 --> 03:41:24,410
Not again.

5386
03:41:25,430 --> 03:41:26,770
Not again.

5387
03:41:27,230 --> 03:41:27,730
Not again.

5388
03:41:27,770 --> 03:41:28,330
Not again.

5389
03:41:28,330 --> 03:41:31,530
Do you not have enough of my pain, Mr. Burns.

5390
03:41:32,710 --> 03:41:33,530
Mr. Burns.

5391
03:41:34,170 --> 03:41:35,390
Out of my way, walking dude.

5392
03:41:36,290 --> 03:41:37,850
Can't you see I'm driving here?

5393
03:41:39,950 --> 03:41:40,630
Seriously.

5394
03:41:42,890 --> 03:41:43,410
Alright.

5395
03:41:45,350 --> 03:41:46,450
Here I go.

5396
03:41:47,670 --> 03:41:47,790
Again?

5397
03:41:50,850 --> 03:41:51,530
Wait.

5398
03:41:52,850 --> 03:41:55,630
I know where the power plant is at least.

5399
03:41:56,890 --> 03:41:57,670
I think.

5400
03:41:58,850 --> 03:42:00,190
Yeah, I know where it is.

5401
03:42:00,650 --> 03:42:01,970
Oh, I fucked it up.

5402
03:42:02,410 --> 03:42:02,890
No.

5403
03:42:03,350 --> 03:42:03,950
Oh no.

5404
03:42:06,130 --> 03:42:07,630
I still know where it is though.

5405
03:42:12,450 --> 03:42:12,890
Weeeeee.

5406
03:42:13,450 --> 03:42:14,650
I'm going to mess you up.

5407
03:42:15,930 --> 03:42:16,990
How is he still...

5408
03:42:16,990 --> 03:42:17,630
Oh, thank God.

5409
03:42:17,750 --> 03:42:17,830
Okay.

5410
03:42:17,830 --> 03:42:18,330
I was going to say.

5411
03:42:18,510 --> 03:42:19,730
How is he still there?

5412
03:42:21,570 --> 03:42:22,010
Okay.

5413
03:42:22,030 --> 03:42:22,730
That's plenty of time.

5414
03:42:22,910 --> 03:42:23,970
A minute is plenty of time.

5415
03:42:25,090 --> 03:42:27,310
That's totally not supposed to happen.

5416
03:42:28,610 --> 03:42:29,730
Oh, that was close.

5417
03:42:30,770 --> 03:42:31,690
I was going to say.

5418
03:42:31,870 --> 03:42:34,070
If he's still chasing me after that area.

5419
03:42:34,530 --> 03:42:36,030
After I make the cemetery jump.

5420
03:42:36,030 --> 03:42:36,570
It's over.

5421
03:42:39,610 --> 03:42:40,130
Alright.

5422
03:42:40,370 --> 03:42:42,190
And then we just pick up the nuclear waste.

5423
03:42:49,690 --> 03:42:50,210
Okay.

5424
03:42:50,330 --> 03:42:50,530
Nice.

5425
03:42:51,690 --> 03:42:52,210
Alright.

5426
03:42:52,590 --> 03:42:53,110
Oh!

5427
03:42:53,550 --> 03:42:53,770
Okay.

5428
03:42:53,910 --> 03:42:54,530
That was sick.

5429
03:42:54,870 --> 03:42:55,470
That was sick.

5430
03:42:55,750 --> 03:42:55,870
Okay.

5431
03:42:55,950 --> 03:42:57,170
What I just did there.

5432
03:42:57,510 --> 03:43:00,770
That had to be the only good time I've ever driven this car.

5433
03:43:03,770 --> 03:43:09,170
That had to be the one time I made a cool turn.

5434
03:43:11,690 --> 03:43:14,030
Oh, the entire time I've played this game.

5435
03:43:17,090 --> 03:43:17,730
Oh my God.

5436
03:43:17,870 --> 03:43:18,290
I squirted.

5437
03:43:18,710 --> 03:43:19,750
I thought I was going to hit that.

5438
03:43:21,870 --> 03:43:22,490
Oh no.

5439
03:43:23,010 --> 03:43:23,270
Oh no.

5440
03:43:23,630 --> 03:43:23,850
Alright.

5441
03:43:23,950 --> 03:43:24,270
Here we go.

5442
03:43:26,030 --> 03:43:27,530
Just gotta not drive too fast.

5443
03:43:28,410 --> 03:43:28,590
Carl!

5444
03:43:28,770 --> 03:43:29,950
Why are you still here, Carl?

5445
03:43:32,290 --> 03:43:33,010
It's fine.

5446
03:43:37,820 --> 03:43:38,420
You're nice.

5447
03:43:40,980 --> 03:43:42,380
Now I gotta drive through here.

5448
03:43:43,460 --> 03:43:43,900
Woo!

5449
03:43:46,060 --> 03:43:48,560
Oh, this is cutting it way too close.

5450
03:43:50,180 --> 03:43:50,620
Alright.

5451
03:43:50,720 --> 03:43:52,460
We're definitely cutting it way too close.

5452
03:43:52,600 --> 03:43:52,880
I don't know.

5453
03:43:52,960 --> 03:43:53,620
We can make it.

5454
03:43:56,140 --> 03:43:57,640
Oh, please, please, please, please, please.

5455
03:43:57,960 --> 03:43:58,400
No.

5456
03:43:58,700 --> 03:43:58,940
No.

5457
03:44:01,420 --> 03:44:01,860
No.

5458
03:44:02,100 --> 03:44:02,480
No.

5459
03:44:06,480 --> 03:44:09,680
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

5460
03:44:09,920 --> 03:44:11,000
No way.

5461
03:44:11,400 --> 03:44:13,440
No way!

5462
03:44:14,520 --> 03:44:17,200
Hey, that's totally not supposed to happen.

5463
03:44:17,200 --> 03:44:19,100
That's not fair.

5464
03:44:22,730 --> 03:44:23,330
Face!

5465
03:44:23,550 --> 03:44:24,250
Oh, shit!

5466
03:44:26,570 --> 03:44:27,470
Holy fuck!

5467
03:44:27,470 --> 03:44:28,190
I made it!

5468
03:44:28,310 --> 03:44:29,150
I actually made it!

5469
03:44:29,290 --> 03:44:30,450
I actually made it!

5470
03:44:30,730 --> 03:44:31,950
Oh my god, I made it!

5471
03:44:32,350 --> 03:44:33,390
I actually made it!

5472
03:44:37,310 --> 03:44:38,430
I can't!

5473
03:44:38,870 --> 03:44:43,830
Oh, Grandpa, I'm going to send you into the nuke!

5474
03:44:48,730 --> 03:44:51,530
I almost think game almost fucked me over!

5475
03:44:59,370 --> 03:45:00,650
I can't...

5476
03:45:00,650 --> 03:45:03,970
Now you're not going to sacrifice me for the greater good, are you, son?

5477
03:45:04,210 --> 03:45:05,310
We'll see, Dad.

5478
03:45:05,550 --> 03:45:06,290
We'll see.

5479
03:45:06,770 --> 03:45:09,970
Oh my god.

5480
03:45:10,770 --> 03:45:13,810
The game didn't want me to win.

5481
03:45:14,130 --> 03:45:16,610
He didn't want... Jesus Christ.

5482
03:45:18,050 --> 03:45:21,310
The game didn't want me to accomplish it.

5483
03:45:22,390 --> 03:45:24,890
It was against me from the very...

5484
03:45:24,890 --> 03:45:27,110
I have to race the car?!

5485
03:45:29,830 --> 03:45:30,390
Where?!

5486
03:45:30,390 --> 03:45:32,890
Like, where is he going?!

5487
03:45:37,430 --> 03:45:40,070
Like, I don't know where this race is gonna be!

5488
03:45:44,400 --> 03:45:46,360
Like, why did I accept the race?!

5489
03:45:49,300 --> 03:45:51,360
Like, why did I accept it?!

5490
03:45:53,080 --> 03:45:55,060
I'm trying to save the world!

5491
03:45:55,060 --> 03:45:55,240
Oh no!

5492
03:45:56,440 --> 03:45:58,040
Oh my god, not that, guys!

5493
03:46:00,580 --> 03:46:01,140
Jesus!

5494
03:46:01,800 --> 03:46:03,000
And then I crash!

5495
03:46:03,160 --> 03:46:04,200
And then I crash!

5496
03:46:04,660 --> 03:46:05,840
Of course I crash!

5497
03:46:06,240 --> 03:46:07,300
Of course I do!

5498
03:46:10,100 --> 03:46:11,120
Oh my god!

5499
03:46:11,860 --> 03:46:13,040
Oh my god!

5500
03:46:13,520 --> 03:46:14,440
Oh my god!

5501
03:46:14,620 --> 03:46:15,320
Everything's up!

5502
03:46:15,640 --> 03:46:16,660
Oh my god!

5503
03:46:16,820 --> 03:46:17,780
And it busted!

5504
03:46:18,380 --> 03:46:19,460
And I'm second place!

5505
03:46:19,700 --> 03:46:22,120
And he put me on the other side!

5506
03:46:22,120 --> 03:46:23,080
That was an insult!

5507
03:46:23,260 --> 03:46:24,340
Please come back!

5508
03:46:24,540 --> 03:46:25,420
I'm so lonely!

5509
03:46:25,740 --> 03:46:26,800
I just said something!

5510
03:46:28,080 --> 03:46:28,200
Ah!

5511
03:46:32,440 --> 03:46:36,420
I'll tear you a new corn chute!

5512
03:46:38,300 --> 03:46:39,620
I've given up!

5513
03:46:40,440 --> 03:46:42,180
I've already given up!

5514
03:46:43,400 --> 03:46:44,840
I've already...

5515
03:46:44,840 --> 03:46:47,020
I've already given up!

5516
03:46:47,520 --> 03:46:48,860
I've already...

5517
03:46:52,080 --> 03:46:54,520
I can't believe it!

5518
03:46:55,240 --> 03:46:57,280
I can't believe it!

5519
03:46:58,580 --> 03:46:59,880
Oh my god!

5520
03:47:00,180 --> 03:47:01,200
They took me...

5521
03:47:01,200 --> 03:47:03,020
They, like, locked me...

5522
03:47:03,020 --> 03:47:06,600
The worst part was they, like, purposely car-locked...

5523
03:47:06,600 --> 03:47:07,540
They locked me in!

5524
03:47:07,680 --> 03:47:08,860
They actually...

5525
03:47:08,860 --> 03:47:10,140
Oh my god!

5526
03:47:11,080 --> 03:47:13,580
They locked me in, too!

5527
03:47:14,620 --> 03:47:16,060
So I couldn't move!

5528
03:47:19,060 --> 03:47:20,800
That was the worst part!

5529
03:47:23,860 --> 03:47:24,900
I literally...

5530
03:47:24,900 --> 03:47:26,080
There was no way of moving!

5531
03:47:28,920 --> 03:47:30,120
There's my helmet!

5532
03:47:30,620 --> 03:47:31,780
Ow, my head!

5533
03:47:32,260 --> 03:47:32,820
Move it!

5534
03:47:32,920 --> 03:47:33,760
I'm not dead yet!

5535
03:47:34,120 --> 03:47:34,920
Eat my duck!

5536
03:47:34,960 --> 03:47:35,800
There was a shortcut there?

5537
03:47:35,940 --> 03:47:36,880
There was a shortcut there!

5538
03:47:37,080 --> 03:47:38,160
There was a shortcut there!

5539
03:47:38,660 --> 03:47:39,180
I...

5540
03:47:41,240 --> 03:47:42,660
Let's make the scene!

5541
03:47:42,660 --> 03:47:43,360
Okay!

5542
03:47:43,880 --> 03:47:44,540
That's fine!

5543
03:47:44,780 --> 03:47:45,120
That's fine!

5544
03:47:45,280 --> 03:47:45,700
Oh my god!

5545
03:47:45,800 --> 03:47:46,840
And he also takes shortcuts!

5546
03:47:47,120 --> 03:47:48,320
And he also takes shortcuts!

5547
03:47:48,560 --> 03:47:49,940
Why don't you cheat more?

5548
03:47:51,060 --> 03:47:52,380
And he doesn't hit that!

5549
03:47:52,460 --> 03:47:53,820
But of course I hit it!

5550
03:47:54,040 --> 03:47:54,700
Of course...

5551
03:47:54,700 --> 03:47:56,800
Of course every car is out to get me!

5552
03:47:57,020 --> 03:47:58,140
They're all out to get me!

5553
03:47:58,380 --> 03:47:59,400
It's all a plan!

5554
03:47:59,720 --> 03:48:01,720
That adrenaline made me feel alive again!

5555
03:48:01,760 --> 03:48:02,840
It's all a plan!

5556
03:48:03,640 --> 03:48:04,740
I just know it!

5557
03:48:04,740 --> 03:48:07,020
They were all out to get me!

5558
03:48:07,280 --> 03:48:07,360
You will be mine!

5559
03:48:07,640 --> 03:48:08,800
Eat my dust...

5560
03:48:08,800 --> 03:48:09,400
Dust eater!

5561
03:48:09,660 --> 03:48:10,640
Get out of my way!

5562
03:48:10,860 --> 03:48:12,560
Every minute might be my last!

5563
03:48:14,740 --> 03:48:15,260
Eh...

5564
03:48:15,260 --> 03:48:18,220
They'll never take me alive, I tell ya!

5565
03:48:18,340 --> 03:48:18,420
Never!

5566
03:48:18,420 --> 03:48:19,120
I can't see!

5567
03:48:19,660 --> 03:48:21,360
I can't fucking see!

5568
03:48:21,800 --> 03:48:22,660
Oh my god!

5569
03:48:22,720 --> 03:48:23,320
We made it!

5570
03:48:23,560 --> 03:48:24,520
We made it!

5571
03:48:24,520 --> 03:48:25,660
But I can't see!

5572
03:48:26,120 --> 03:48:26,580
I...

5573
03:48:30,280 --> 03:48:31,800
I can't see anything!

5574
03:48:33,780 --> 03:48:34,720
Where's the repair?

5575
03:48:34,880 --> 03:48:36,540
And I have to do it 50 seconds!

5576
03:48:36,840 --> 03:48:39,920
I have to do this in 50 seconds and I can't see!

5577
03:48:40,540 --> 03:48:41,000
I...

5578
03:48:41,000 --> 03:48:42,380
And the cops are out to get me!

5579
03:48:43,140 --> 03:48:43,600
And...

5580
03:48:43,600 --> 03:48:45,440
aPS3 Ah...

5581
03:48:45,440 --> 03:48:46,680
Another one?!

5582
03:48:46,680 --> 03:48:48,220
What a big idea!

5583
03:48:48,940 --> 03:48:51,920
This one is at 50 seconds!

5584
03:48:52,980 --> 03:48:53,920
Oh, yeah!

5585
03:48:54,300 --> 03:48:55,600
Crystal eggs and the crime!

5586
03:48:55,920 --> 03:48:57,360
I blame the Democrats!

5587
03:48:57,860 --> 03:48:59,800
I feel bad about myself!

5588
03:49:00,220 --> 03:49:00,400
Stop!

5589
03:49:08,790 --> 03:49:10,950
Oh my god!

5590
03:49:11,930 --> 03:49:12,730
When...

5591
03:49:12,730 --> 03:49:14,750
When will I finish!

5592
03:49:14,850 --> 03:49:14,950
Oh my god!

5593
03:49:14,950 --> 03:49:16,690
Be fair to me.

5594
03:49:17,670 --> 03:49:18,190
Wait!

5595
03:49:20,690 --> 03:49:22,070
Okay, this is okay.

5596
03:49:22,330 --> 03:49:22,850
This is okay.

5597
03:49:23,050 --> 03:49:24,110
I figured out the route.

5598
03:49:24,630 --> 03:49:26,470
I know where he's gonna go.

5599
03:49:28,290 --> 03:49:33,230
I know where he's gonna go and I know where all the shortcuts are for real this time.

5600
03:49:34,930 --> 03:49:38,710
I'm like, so focused on finding all the shortcuts now.

5601
03:49:40,210 --> 03:49:41,250
Wait, where's the shortcut?

5602
03:49:45,270 --> 03:49:46,570
Wait, where's the shortcut?

5603
03:49:49,030 --> 03:49:50,050
Wait a minute.

5604
03:49:50,290 --> 03:49:51,910
There was supposed to be a shortcut there.

5605
03:49:52,770 --> 03:49:54,490
How did he get the shortcut?

5606
03:49:54,910 --> 03:49:57,830
Where is... Where is that shortcut?

5607
03:49:59,150 --> 03:50:00,470
That's fine, that's fine, that's fine.

5608
03:50:00,590 --> 03:50:02,150
I'm gonna run him over and then we're gonna get arrested.

5609
03:50:02,870 --> 03:50:03,630
But that's okay.

5610
03:50:06,010 --> 03:50:06,790
That's okay.

5611
03:50:09,470 --> 03:50:10,850
Oh my god, we dodged it.

5612
03:50:11,370 --> 03:50:12,090
That's fine.

5613
03:50:12,670 --> 03:50:13,890
We dodged it all.

5614
03:50:16,470 --> 03:50:17,390
Where do we go here?

5615
03:50:17,810 --> 03:50:18,910
We can keep dodging.

5616
03:50:19,750 --> 03:50:21,350
Oh my god, we dodged it all.

5617
03:50:23,210 --> 03:50:23,850
We're gaming.

5618
03:50:27,810 --> 03:50:28,670
Okay, we have a minute.

5619
03:50:28,670 --> 03:50:30,170
I swear!

5620
03:50:30,590 --> 03:50:38,590
I swear!

5621
03:50:38,770 --> 03:50:40,070
Okay, that's fine.

5622
03:50:40,590 --> 03:50:41,450
That's fine.

5623
03:50:42,650 --> 03:50:43,490
That's fine.

5624
03:50:43,750 --> 03:50:44,390
We're broke.

5625
03:50:44,630 --> 03:50:45,170
We're broke.

5626
03:50:45,390 --> 03:50:45,810
It's fine.

5627
03:50:46,370 --> 03:50:47,270
Get out of my way.

5628
03:50:47,270 --> 03:50:48,350
It was never meant to be.

5629
03:50:50,250 --> 03:50:54,990
Okay, the fact that we have a minute left for this is a little, like, scary.

5630
03:50:55,190 --> 03:50:57,890
Because, like, I don't think I've... I don't... I don't know.

5631
03:50:58,470 --> 03:50:59,570
It's, like, super tight.

5632
03:51:03,190 --> 03:51:04,270
Oh my god.

5633
03:51:04,830 --> 03:51:04,850
Oh my god.

5634
03:51:04,850 --> 03:51:06,890
The amount of times I've driven this one area.

5635
03:51:10,960 --> 03:51:12,580
The amount of times I've hit Carl.

5636
03:51:12,580 --> 03:51:13,560
No!

5637
03:51:15,080 --> 03:51:16,060
No, no.

5638
03:51:16,620 --> 03:51:16,740
No!

5639
03:51:17,460 --> 03:51:18,180
Oh,

5640
03:51:22,400 --> 03:51:22,840
I did it!

5641
03:51:23,080 --> 03:51:24,620
As a final!

5642
03:51:24,980 --> 03:51:25,620
Fuck you!

5643
03:51:27,800 --> 03:51:29,260
Just arrest me.

5644
03:51:33,360 --> 03:51:34,680
Just arrest me.

5645
03:51:34,860 --> 03:51:36,660
Put me out of my misery.

5646
03:51:40,100 --> 03:51:42,720
Okay, we can reset this so we don't have to do the race again.

5647
03:51:44,700 --> 03:51:45,500
It's fine.

5648
03:51:46,660 --> 03:51:47,460
Just arrest me.

5649
03:51:47,460 --> 03:51:48,080
That's fine.

5650
03:51:48,320 --> 03:51:48,780
That's fine.

5651
03:51:48,880 --> 03:51:51,500
Just let me... I swear to God.

5652
03:51:51,800 --> 03:51:53,520
Why does it keep putting me backwards?

5653
03:51:54,080 --> 03:51:55,200
I don't know why.

5654
03:51:55,660 --> 03:51:59,300
Every time they arrest me, they put me in the opposite direction.

5655
03:52:01,960 --> 03:52:03,320
It doesn't make sense.

5656
03:52:03,920 --> 03:52:04,600
Like, they're perfect.

5657
03:52:04,880 --> 03:52:05,800
They're like in on it.

5658
03:52:06,200 --> 03:52:07,440
They're actually in on it.

5659
03:52:08,980 --> 03:52:10,100
Oh my God.

5660
03:52:10,680 --> 03:52:11,380
Oh my God, please.

5661
03:52:11,540 --> 03:52:11,800
Please.

5662
03:52:11,800 --> 03:52:13,820
I don't want to do this race again.

5663
03:52:14,500 --> 03:52:15,820
I don't want to do this race again.

5664
03:52:17,080 --> 03:52:17,440
Alright.

5665
03:52:18,080 --> 03:52:19,520
Learn to drive, dumbass.

5666
03:52:20,100 --> 03:52:21,000
Alright, here we go.

5667
03:52:27,120 --> 03:52:28,300
It's a little bumpy.

5668
03:52:29,680 --> 03:52:31,160
But we're doing it.

5669
03:52:33,840 --> 03:52:35,680
Alright, the cops are going to show up again.

5670
03:52:39,860 --> 03:52:44,440
God, I wish the meter would go down faster.

5671
03:52:44,720 --> 03:52:46,260
Like, it's just not fair.

5672
03:52:47,820 --> 03:52:50,120
Wait, I have 26 seconds?

5673
03:52:51,400 --> 03:52:52,520
Oh, it's over.

5674
03:52:53,100 --> 03:52:54,940
There's no way I'm making it there.

5675
03:52:55,340 --> 03:52:56,200
It's over.

5676
03:52:56,580 --> 03:52:59,320
I didn't even realize I had 26 seconds.

5677
03:53:00,240 --> 03:53:02,000
Oh, it's already over.

5678
03:53:03,000 --> 03:53:05,500
I figured it out was quick like Clint.

5679
03:53:05,780 --> 03:53:06,620
Just a few more.

5680
03:53:07,120 --> 03:53:08,300
And I also...

5681
03:53:08,300 --> 03:53:10,340
Oh my God.

5682
03:53:10,340 --> 03:53:11,600
Please come back.

5683
03:53:11,720 --> 03:53:12,720
I'm so lonely.

5684
03:53:13,280 --> 03:53:17,960
Oh, please don't tell anybody I did this back in my day.

5685
03:53:17,960 --> 03:53:19,180
We call sandwiches.

5686
03:53:19,840 --> 03:53:20,460
Let's pretty.

5687
03:53:20,860 --> 03:53:23,080
And they cost four playing cards a bite.

5688
03:53:27,420 --> 03:53:29,400
This is truly insanity.

5689
03:53:30,580 --> 03:53:33,820
This level is actually insanity.

5690
03:53:36,100 --> 03:53:37,960
This one level.

5691
03:53:38,420 --> 03:53:40,000
This one level.

5692
03:53:41,080 --> 03:53:42,640
It's like...

5693
03:53:42,640 --> 03:53:43,520
It's like...

5694
03:53:43,520 --> 03:53:45,500
I can't avoid them.

5695
03:53:45,780 --> 03:53:47,420
There's 200 people.

5696
03:53:48,080 --> 03:53:49,340
Civilians here.

5697
03:53:49,600 --> 03:53:52,660
I don't understand why there's so many civilians.

5698
03:53:54,260 --> 03:53:56,520
Where did they come from?

5699
03:54:00,060 --> 03:54:03,340
Where did all these civilians come from?

5700
03:54:08,160 --> 03:54:09,260
Oh, yeah.

5701
03:54:09,500 --> 03:54:09,620
No.

5702
03:54:09,880 --> 03:54:10,120
Okay.

5703
03:54:10,380 --> 03:54:10,800
That's fine.

5704
03:54:11,820 --> 03:54:13,200
That's fine.

5705
03:54:14,560 --> 03:54:17,160
How dare these civilians live here.

5706
03:54:20,500 --> 03:54:22,220
I don't understand.

5707
03:54:22,620 --> 03:54:25,820
I don't understand why they exist.

5708
03:54:29,040 --> 03:54:29,620
Stay on target.

5709
03:54:29,760 --> 03:54:30,620
Stay on target.

5710
03:54:30,820 --> 03:54:31,240
Oh my God.

5711
03:54:31,360 --> 03:54:31,820
Oh my God.

5712
03:54:31,920 --> 03:54:32,660
Oh my God.

5713
03:54:32,780 --> 03:54:36,020
I got hit once and then everything went spiraling out of control.

5714
03:54:37,960 --> 03:54:38,440
All right.

5715
03:54:38,540 --> 03:54:38,800
Here we go.

5716
03:54:40,520 --> 03:54:40,920
Nice.

5717
03:54:41,520 --> 03:54:41,940
Wait a minute.

5718
03:54:42,120 --> 03:54:43,120
That was an insult.

5719
03:54:44,560 --> 03:54:44,820
Okay.

5720
03:54:44,900 --> 03:54:45,180
Nice.

5721
03:54:46,020 --> 03:54:47,640
It's not too bad right now.

5722
03:54:47,840 --> 03:54:48,380
Oh my God.

5723
03:54:48,380 --> 03:54:49,140
This is the shortcut.

5724
03:54:50,140 --> 03:54:50,920
I knew it.

5725
03:54:51,960 --> 03:54:53,100
I figured it out.

5726
03:54:53,400 --> 03:54:55,940
Now my story begins in 19-tickety-two.

5727
03:54:55,960 --> 03:54:57,080
I figured out the shortcut.

5728
03:54:57,400 --> 03:54:57,660
Yeah, say dickety.

5729
03:54:57,660 --> 03:55:00,440
Because the Kaiser had stolen our worth 20.

5730
03:55:00,720 --> 03:55:01,200
All right.

5731
03:55:01,320 --> 03:55:01,620
Out of control.

5732
03:55:02,540 --> 03:55:03,100
No.

5733
03:55:03,820 --> 03:55:04,920
No, not the pole.

5734
03:55:05,920 --> 03:55:06,620
Oh my God.

5735
03:55:06,740 --> 03:55:07,880
He's right behind me, isn't he?

5736
03:55:08,080 --> 03:55:09,400
He's right behind me.

5737
03:55:09,580 --> 03:55:10,320
I can see him.

5738
03:55:11,020 --> 03:55:11,980
Eat my dust.

5739
03:55:14,420 --> 03:55:15,480
Oh my God.

5740
03:55:15,700 --> 03:55:17,300
I can't control my car.

5741
03:55:18,800 --> 03:55:19,360
Abe.

5742
03:55:19,540 --> 03:55:22,140
Why does your car fucking suck?

5743
03:55:22,140 --> 03:55:24,540
Oh, I'm going to a better place.

5744
03:55:26,960 --> 03:55:28,400
Jesus Christ.

5745
03:55:29,760 --> 03:55:30,740
Oh my God.

5746
03:55:30,940 --> 03:55:31,920
I fucking...

5747
03:55:35,280 --> 03:55:37,020
Don't get drunk, you dumbass.

5748
03:55:37,380 --> 03:55:38,340
Mistakes were made.

5749
03:55:45,940 --> 03:55:48,780
I don't know how I spun out!

5750
03:55:49,240 --> 03:55:53,400
The physics, like... It had a life of its own.

5751
03:55:54,080 --> 03:55:55,980
It acts like I didn't touch anything.

5752
03:55:56,180 --> 03:55:57,000
It just spun out.

5753
03:55:57,340 --> 03:55:58,860
Like, I don't understand.

5754
03:55:59,280 --> 03:56:00,800
I didn't even touch anything.

5755
03:56:01,120 --> 03:56:02,400
It just happened.

5756
03:56:02,400 --> 03:56:04,780
Watch it, I almost spilled my sundae.

5757
03:56:07,040 --> 03:56:07,640
Alright.

5758
03:56:08,300 --> 03:56:09,200
Here we go.

5759
03:56:12,280 --> 03:56:14,380
I hit one tiny thing!

5760
03:56:14,680 --> 03:56:16,000
And then it was gone.

5761
03:56:16,180 --> 03:56:16,980
My car was gone.

5762
03:56:18,360 --> 03:56:20,460
The car was like, goodbye, GG's.

5763
03:56:21,100 --> 03:56:24,500
Oh my god, he's right behind me too.

5764
03:56:28,260 --> 03:56:30,200
Oh, there's the cops!

5765
03:56:32,400 --> 03:56:35,140
We call sandwiches... Here we are!

5766
03:56:42,170 --> 03:56:43,420
Here he goes!

5767
03:56:44,760 --> 03:56:45,380
Goodbye!

5768
03:56:46,220 --> 03:56:47,740
I fucking hate the races.

5769
03:56:48,060 --> 03:56:50,740
I hate the races so much.

5770
03:56:51,200 --> 03:56:56,960
The races are actually the worst... I... The worst content.

5771
03:56:57,460 --> 03:56:58,700
The worst level design.

5772
03:57:03,480 --> 03:57:04,440
Oh my god!

5773
03:57:04,460 --> 03:57:05,780
How much more do you want me to spin out?

5774
03:57:06,200 --> 03:57:06,680
Oh my god!

5775
03:57:06,800 --> 03:57:07,640
Hit my car more!

5776
03:57:08,040 --> 03:57:09,220
Hit my car more!

5777
03:57:10,200 --> 03:57:12,840
And then I get blamed for it!

5778
03:57:12,840 --> 03:57:12,900
And then I get blamed for it!

5779
03:57:13,360 --> 03:57:15,960
Please don't tell anybody I did this!

5780
03:57:16,340 --> 03:57:17,660
I am excellente!

5781
03:57:17,660 --> 03:57:18,660
Oh my god!

5782
03:57:18,660 --> 03:57:20,280
Oh my god, I can't see anything!

5783
03:57:36,580 --> 03:57:39,300
I can't see anything!

5784
03:57:40,280 --> 03:57:42,380
I can't see anything!

5785
03:57:42,380 --> 03:57:44,620
I'm scratching myself, you're history.

5786
03:57:45,740 --> 03:57:46,500
Okay.

5787
03:57:48,000 --> 03:57:49,260
Okay, here we go.

5788
03:57:50,160 --> 03:57:50,920
Wooooo.

5789
03:57:51,540 --> 03:57:54,060
This is the greatest day of my life.

5790
03:57:54,500 --> 03:57:54,640
Okay.

5791
03:57:59,390 --> 03:57:59,750
Alright.

5792
03:58:00,870 --> 03:58:01,610
Let's go here.

5793
03:58:03,610 --> 03:58:04,650
Oh my god.

5794
03:58:06,250 --> 03:58:07,010
I'm stuck.

5795
03:58:08,110 --> 03:58:11,370
I'm stuck.

5796
03:58:11,550 --> 03:58:12,470
I'm stuck.

5797
03:58:16,360 --> 03:58:17,280
That's fine.

5798
03:58:17,480 --> 03:58:17,820
That's fine.

5799
03:58:17,900 --> 03:58:19,140
It looks harder than it is.

5800
03:58:21,540 --> 03:58:22,260
I...

5801
03:58:22,260 --> 03:58:24,540
Eat my dust, dust-eater.

5802
03:58:25,780 --> 03:58:26,320
Fuck.

5803
03:58:29,080 --> 03:58:30,560
That wasn't part of the deal.

5804
03:58:33,520 --> 03:58:34,520
Stupid car.

5805
03:58:35,280 --> 03:58:36,540
Stupid car.

5806
03:58:36,780 --> 03:58:38,700
Stupid fucking car.

5807
03:58:39,180 --> 03:58:40,600
Stupid car.

5808
03:58:41,420 --> 03:58:41,780
Stupid car.

5809
03:58:43,560 --> 03:58:44,280
Sweet.

5810
03:58:47,600 --> 03:58:48,540
This is art.

5811
03:58:48,680 --> 03:58:48,960
Thank you.

5812
03:58:49,100 --> 03:58:51,260
Welcome to the tornado farm.

5813
03:58:51,740 --> 03:58:52,260
Welcome.

5814
03:58:52,620 --> 03:58:53,100
Welcome.

5815
03:58:56,620 --> 03:58:57,780
Oh my god.

5816
03:58:58,140 --> 03:59:01,900
I think the worst part is the RNG of the other cars too.

5817
03:59:02,460 --> 03:59:04,460
You have to take into account of like...

5818
03:59:04,460 --> 03:59:07,740
You can get fucked over by the RNG of the other cars.

5819
03:59:08,000 --> 03:59:09,560
I don't know how speedrunners do this.

5820
03:59:09,560 --> 03:59:12,540
And have... They have to take into account of so much RNG shit.

5821
03:59:13,840 --> 03:59:15,480
There's no way there's a pattern.

5822
03:59:15,760 --> 03:59:18,280
I refuse to believe the cars have a pattern.

5823
03:59:20,760 --> 03:59:21,840
There's no way.

5824
03:59:22,260 --> 03:59:25,420
These people... They don't have any mind of their own.

5825
03:59:25,420 --> 03:59:26,280
Sandwiches.

5826
03:59:26,340 --> 03:59:27,260
Flat pretty.

5827
03:59:27,580 --> 03:59:29,880
And it costs more playing cards a bite.

5828
03:59:31,160 --> 03:59:31,640
Weeheehee.

5829
03:59:33,180 --> 03:59:33,980
Hot diggity.

5830
03:59:34,380 --> 03:59:34,600
Woohoo!

5831
03:59:35,040 --> 03:59:35,300
Okay.

5832
03:59:38,080 --> 03:59:38,900
I hear ya.

5833
03:59:40,260 --> 03:59:41,480
Oh my god.

5834
03:59:41,620 --> 03:59:43,560
There's nothing I can do about the fucking cops.

5835
03:59:48,680 --> 03:59:49,480
Oh my god.

5836
03:59:49,600 --> 03:59:49,960
Get out.

5837
03:59:50,080 --> 03:59:50,780
Get out of here.

5838
03:59:50,920 --> 03:59:51,760
Get out of my way!

5839
03:59:52,220 --> 03:59:52,940
I didn't do it.

5840
03:59:53,120 --> 03:59:53,600
Watch it.

5841
03:59:54,200 --> 03:59:57,060
And then I barely make any distance.

5842
04:00:01,300 --> 04:00:01,820
Okay.

5843
04:00:02,400 --> 04:00:04,860
Look where you going, you idiot.

5844
04:00:13,700 --> 04:00:14,440
Oh my god.

5845
04:00:14,760 --> 04:00:16,020
I already lost so much time.

5846
04:00:16,200 --> 04:00:17,440
By backing up into that.

5847
04:00:17,820 --> 04:00:19,520
I already fucked up the backup.

5848
04:00:20,380 --> 04:00:22,000
Are you fucking...

5849
04:00:22,000 --> 04:00:23,160
Okay, that's a lot, dude.

5850
04:00:27,140 --> 04:00:28,680
Where did he come from?

5851
04:00:29,180 --> 04:00:30,480
Where did he go?

5852
04:00:30,480 --> 04:00:32,660
Where did he come from?

5853
04:00:32,880 --> 04:00:33,860
Can I jump?

5854
04:00:39,340 --> 04:00:40,160
Okay.

5855
04:00:42,320 --> 04:00:44,180
Alright, the bumpy road.

5856
04:00:45,190 --> 04:00:46,100
I have to.

5857
04:00:48,120 --> 04:00:48,940
I...

5858
04:00:52,350 --> 04:00:54,740
Guess I don't have to, guys.

5859
04:00:55,500 --> 04:00:57,180
Guess I don't.

5860
04:00:58,120 --> 04:01:00,100
Who would have known?

5861
04:01:00,900 --> 04:01:01,000
Who would have known?

5862
04:01:01,000 --> 04:01:02,760
I did not have to.

5863
04:01:05,700 --> 04:01:07,280
Just arrest me.

5864
04:01:07,780 --> 04:01:09,300
Just arrest me.

5865
04:01:09,620 --> 04:01:09,800
I...

5866
04:01:09,800 --> 04:01:11,260
Do you think I care?

5867
04:01:11,720 --> 04:01:13,300
Just arrest me.

5868
04:01:17,730 --> 04:01:18,770
Okay.

5869
04:01:20,550 --> 04:01:20,730
Oh.

5870
04:01:21,470 --> 04:01:22,490
This level.

5871
04:01:23,510 --> 04:01:25,870
This fucking level.

5872
04:01:27,190 --> 04:01:28,770
Why would...

5873
04:01:28,770 --> 04:01:31,770
Why would driving through pumpkins be a crime?

5874
04:01:32,610 --> 04:01:33,930
It's Halloween!

5875
04:01:37,570 --> 04:01:40,830
There should be other things to worry about.

5876
04:01:42,010 --> 04:01:44,190
Find that.

5877
04:01:46,530 --> 04:01:48,470
Let's go back.

5878
04:01:49,330 --> 04:01:50,090
No!

5879
04:01:50,090 --> 04:01:51,210
Killed that.

5880
04:02:06,970 --> 04:02:08,930
Alright, we have to get that.

5881
04:02:09,590 --> 04:02:12,910
And after we get that... Oh, the dumpster has a ramp.

5882
04:02:13,390 --> 04:02:13,990
Alright.

5883
04:02:14,430 --> 04:02:16,230
What else do I have to lose?

5884
04:02:19,030 --> 04:02:21,310
I have nothing else to lose anyway.

5885
04:02:25,120 --> 04:02:26,340
Get out of my way!

5886
04:02:26,540 --> 04:02:28,200
Every minute might be my last!

5887
04:02:28,760 --> 04:02:30,240
Back at it again!

5888
04:02:34,380 --> 04:02:34,900
Alright.

5889
04:02:35,060 --> 04:02:35,820
Get out of my way!

5890
04:02:36,060 --> 04:02:37,820
Every minute might be my last!

5891
04:02:37,940 --> 04:02:38,820
Oh my god!

5892
04:02:39,240 --> 04:02:40,580
The dumpster was a ramp.

5893
04:02:41,640 --> 04:02:43,680
Alright, I'll work the pedals and you steer.

5894
04:02:46,380 --> 04:02:47,580
Love it or lose it!

5895
04:02:48,120 --> 04:02:50,140
Oh, I'm going to a better place!

5896
04:02:54,400 --> 04:02:56,180
What a big idea!

5897
04:02:57,180 --> 04:02:58,180
Mark did it!

5898
04:02:58,440 --> 04:02:58,740
Woohoo!

5899
04:03:04,040 --> 04:03:05,680
To his merciful McGillicuddy!

5900
04:03:06,460 --> 04:03:07,580
Where are the police officers?

5901
04:03:07,580 --> 04:03:09,580
I'm not a very driver...

5902
04:03:13,300 --> 04:03:13,740
Oooooh!

5903
04:03:19,480 --> 04:03:22,360
Oh my God...

5904
04:03:33,520 --> 04:03:35,960
I can't drive anymore!

5905
04:03:36,380 --> 04:03:36,420
To his mates...

5906
04:03:36,420 --> 04:03:37,940
He means toBox me!

5907
04:03:38,040 --> 04:03:40,300
I can't drive anymore...

5908
04:03:40,300 --> 04:03:41,340
I can't...

5909
04:03:41,840 --> 04:03:42,280
Okay...

5910
04:03:42,280 --> 04:03:43,100
Okay, I got this.

5911
04:03:43,620 --> 04:03:44,480
I got this.

5912
04:03:44,480 --> 04:03:46,080
You got this.

5913
04:03:46,080 --> 04:03:48,500
You got this, doKi...

5914
04:03:51,780 --> 04:03:54,480
You got this, Cap.

5915
04:03:54,840 --> 04:03:57,300
It won't take you that long.

5916
04:03:58,220 --> 04:03:59,520
Doki, please.

5917
04:03:59,860 --> 04:04:01,820
You have so much.

5918
04:04:02,220 --> 04:04:05,220
You have so much to live for.

5919
04:04:06,460 --> 04:04:10,140
We're not doing the tires anymore.

5920
04:04:10,940 --> 04:04:13,660
We're not doing the tires anymore.

5921
04:04:15,980 --> 04:04:17,660
We've learned our lesson.

5922
04:04:22,160 --> 04:04:23,840
Oh, no.

5923
04:04:24,700 --> 04:04:26,260
Oh, no.

5924
04:04:28,100 --> 04:04:29,480
Oh, no.

5925
04:04:31,560 --> 04:04:33,300
It's not okay.

5926
04:04:37,280 --> 04:04:38,500
Please don't hit me.

5927
04:04:38,640 --> 04:04:42,680
Please don't- PLEASE DON'T HIT ME YOU STUPID FUCKING- It's a 19-tickety-two.

5928
04:04:42,940 --> 04:04:47,260
We had to say tickety, cause the Kaiser had stolen our worth 20-

5929
04:04:51,400 --> 04:04:51,720
Uh...

5930
04:04:52,040 --> 04:04:53,680
Back at it we go.

5931
04:04:54,680 --> 04:04:55,320
Yay!

5932
04:04:59,960 --> 04:05:02,180
He hit me!

5933
04:05:02,920 --> 04:05:06,940
What was I supposed to do in that situation?

5934
04:05:07,620 --> 04:05:09,460
He hit me!

5935
04:05:09,460 --> 04:05:11,560
Somebody tell me what just happened.

5936
04:05:11,900 --> 04:05:13,100
Move it, you milkshake!

5937
04:05:13,220 --> 04:05:15,280
There was nothing I could do!

5938
04:05:16,180 --> 04:05:17,300
Get out of my way!

5939
04:05:17,480 --> 04:05:19,200
Every minute might be my last!

5940
04:05:19,500 --> 04:05:20,480
God darn it!

5941
04:05:20,940 --> 04:05:22,000
I have no insurance!

5942
04:05:22,700 --> 04:05:24,740
Alright, I'll wipe the pedals and you steer.

5943
04:05:25,740 --> 04:05:26,420
Oh, did I do something wrong?

5944
04:05:26,420 --> 04:05:27,380
Oh my god, can I make this?

5945
04:05:27,700 --> 04:05:29,120
Let's make the scene!

5946
04:05:29,720 --> 04:05:30,380
I can make it.

5947
04:05:30,460 --> 04:05:31,000
Okay, that's good.

5948
04:05:32,660 --> 04:05:33,740
I have to get that.

5949
04:05:35,040 --> 04:05:36,700
Oh my god, not the spin-out!

5950
04:05:36,920 --> 04:05:37,780
Please, not the spin-out!

5951
04:05:37,780 --> 04:05:38,320
Oh my god!

5952
04:05:38,780 --> 04:05:39,360
Oh, that was close!

5953
04:05:39,480 --> 04:05:39,860
That was close!

5954
04:05:40,000 --> 04:05:40,320
That was close!

5955
04:05:40,420 --> 04:05:40,800
That was close!

5956
04:05:40,880 --> 04:05:41,720
That was close!

5957
04:05:42,360 --> 04:05:43,180
That was close!

5958
04:05:43,740 --> 04:05:44,100
That was close!

5959
04:05:44,900 --> 04:05:45,600
That was close!

5960
04:05:45,820 --> 04:05:47,440
The spin-out was- was right there.

5961
04:05:50,780 --> 04:05:52,300
Alright, here we go again!

5962
04:05:52,860 --> 04:05:54,100
Here we go again!

5963
04:05:55,940 --> 04:05:58,060
Eventually, something will be different.

5964
04:05:58,420 --> 04:05:59,060
I believe.

5965
04:06:04,420 --> 04:06:06,060
I swear to god!

5966
04:06:11,360 --> 04:06:26,020
I hate... I... I don't know what to do against these zombies... I don't know what to do against the zombies.

5967
04:06:29,900 --> 04:06:33,300
I can't get past this area.

5968
04:06:34,000 --> 04:06:36,180
Because of the zombies.

5969
04:06:38,900 --> 04:06:40,320
Arrest me.

5970
04:06:43,800 --> 04:06:44,820
Okay.

5971
04:06:47,520 --> 04:06:48,540
Okay.

5972
04:06:48,800 --> 04:06:49,280
That's fine.

5973
04:06:58,930 --> 04:06:59,990
He he he he.

5974
04:07:00,470 --> 04:07:02,910
Good thing that only injured my strokey side.

5975
04:07:05,550 --> 04:07:07,770
Alright, I'll work the pedals and you steer.

5976
04:07:07,990 --> 04:07:09,730
We repaired our car.

5977
04:07:10,270 --> 04:07:11,790
And then...

5978
04:07:11,790 --> 04:07:14,010
And then we do this.

5979
04:07:20,240 --> 04:07:20,820
And then...

5980
04:07:20,820 --> 04:07:22,000
And then we do this.

5981
04:07:22,200 --> 04:07:23,880
You mean speed thingy.

5982
04:07:24,380 --> 04:07:26,580
And then it should be fine now.

5983
04:07:26,780 --> 04:07:29,220
As long as I don't hit anything.

5984
04:07:30,300 --> 04:07:31,980
The vibration tickling my feet.

5985
04:07:31,980 --> 04:07:33,020
It should be fine.

5986
04:07:33,360 --> 04:07:34,880
That adrenaline made me feel alive again.

5987
04:07:34,880 --> 04:07:38,240
I swear to god, I'm pretty sure they like add...

5988
04:07:38,740 --> 04:07:40,220
They added more...

5989
04:07:42,520 --> 04:07:43,680
I'm not doing the ramp.

5990
04:07:43,840 --> 04:07:44,740
I'm not doing the ramp.

5991
04:07:44,880 --> 04:07:47,540
That ramp, no matter where you go, I hit something.

5992
04:07:47,540 --> 04:07:48,740
I'm not doing the ramp.

5993
04:07:48,940 --> 04:07:50,680
That ramp is just a lie.

5994
04:07:50,680 --> 04:07:51,940
It's just fake.

5995
04:07:51,960 --> 04:07:53,120
That there's...

5996
04:07:57,260 --> 04:07:59,180
That ramp is...

5997
04:07:59,180 --> 04:08:00,120
There's no way.

5998
04:08:00,300 --> 04:08:03,640
There's no way you can do this ramp without fucking hitting it.

5999
04:08:03,740 --> 04:08:07,060
I refuse to believe there's a way to not get hit it.

6000
04:08:07,700 --> 04:08:08,920
There's no way.

6001
04:08:13,380 --> 04:08:13,980
Alright.

6002
04:08:15,020 --> 04:08:15,580
Here we go.

6003
04:08:19,560 --> 04:08:20,040
Okay.

6004
04:08:21,520 --> 04:08:22,000
Okay.

6005
04:08:22,120 --> 04:08:22,360
Okay, Doki.

6006
04:08:22,720 --> 04:08:22,900
Lock it.

6007
04:08:23,120 --> 04:08:23,500
Lock it.

6008
04:08:23,580 --> 04:08:24,500
I swear to god.

6009
04:08:25,120 --> 04:08:25,600
Please.

6010
04:08:25,940 --> 04:08:27,060
You do...

6011
04:08:27,060 --> 04:08:27,880
Please.

6012
04:08:28,060 --> 04:08:29,500
You don't have much left in you.

6013
04:08:29,820 --> 04:08:30,640
Lock it.

6014
04:08:33,060 --> 04:08:33,540
Alright.

6015
04:08:33,620 --> 04:08:34,640
The cops are gonna come.

6016
04:08:34,740 --> 04:08:36,060
Any moment now.

6017
04:08:39,620 --> 04:08:41,020
Oh my god.

6018
04:08:41,020 --> 04:08:41,720
I'm like my god.

6019
04:08:42,340 --> 04:08:46,560
Oh my god.

6020
04:08:48,980 --> 04:08:50,200
Oh va… Oh my god!

6021
04:08:50,420 --> 04:08:51,800
If only because I'm not imagining these guys.

6022
04:08:52,180 --> 04:08:52,720
AIHHHHHHHHHH!

6023
04:08:53,940 --> 04:08:55,840
Oh now I have a wedgies!

6024
04:08:57,800 --> 04:08:58,640
Where...

6025
04:09:04,050 --> 04:09:09,570
It just sparked, it just sparked, it just sparked in front of me.

6026
04:09:10,570 --> 04:09:15,970
And then just rams in... and then just rams into my car.

6027
04:09:16,330 --> 04:09:17,790
Just like that.

6028
04:09:20,410 --> 04:09:23,650
How... How was that legal?

6029
04:09:24,910 --> 04:09:30,130
He literally... He just... He just spawns in front of me.

6030
04:09:32,550 --> 04:09:34,190
Oh my god.

6031
04:09:37,350 --> 04:09:38,270
Okay.

6032
04:09:39,310 --> 04:09:40,230
Okay.

6033
04:09:40,230 --> 04:09:41,110
Okay.

6034
04:09:41,510 --> 04:09:42,250
Okay.

6035
04:09:42,750 --> 04:09:43,490
Okay.

6036
04:09:44,090 --> 04:09:44,830
Okay.

6037
04:09:45,550 --> 04:09:46,950
I'm locked in.

6038
04:09:47,390 --> 04:09:47,970
For real.

6039
04:09:50,410 --> 04:09:59,590
There has to be a way... To not... To not have all the fucking cops on you.

6040
04:10:00,390 --> 04:10:04,650
I'm so... This shortcut is so hard to drive.

6041
04:10:05,070 --> 04:10:07,330
This shortcut... I can't.

6042
04:10:08,230 --> 04:10:10,110
Abe, your car sucks.

6043
04:10:10,230 --> 04:10:12,290
Your car fucking sucks.

6044
04:10:12,410 --> 04:10:15,630
Like, I... This is not an upgrade.

6045
04:10:16,030 --> 04:10:18,370
I... He made his car... Worse.

6046
04:10:26,030 --> 04:10:29,150
I haven't got past that graveyard.

6047
04:10:29,230 --> 04:10:30,470
It's so long.

6048
04:10:34,940 --> 04:10:35,620
Okay.

6049
04:10:37,300 --> 04:10:37,980
Okay.

6050
04:10:38,100 --> 04:10:38,440
Here we go.

6051
04:10:39,200 --> 04:10:39,520
Here we go.

6052
04:10:40,060 --> 04:10:41,960
This time, I'm definitely locked in.

6053
04:10:45,730 --> 04:10:46,810
Oh my god.

6054
04:10:46,930 --> 04:10:48,790
The cops are gonna show up again.

6055
04:10:50,290 --> 04:10:51,810
I can feel it.

6056
04:10:54,610 --> 04:10:56,110
I can feel it.

6057
04:10:56,250 --> 04:10:58,090
I feel the cops coming in.

6058
04:10:58,090 --> 04:10:59,270
I'm dead, I'm dead yet.

6059
04:11:00,810 --> 04:11:03,310
Reckless driving in my pet peeve.

6060
04:11:04,250 --> 04:11:04,250
Okay.

6061
04:11:04,270 --> 04:11:04,610
Alright.

6062
04:11:04,750 --> 04:11:07,170
Didn't think the old man had it in him, did ya?

6063
04:11:07,250 --> 04:11:07,710
Here we go.

6064
04:11:11,050 --> 04:11:12,190
Why is this car...

6065
04:11:12,190 --> 04:11:13,010
Okay, car.

6066
04:11:15,150 --> 04:11:15,670
Okay.

6067
04:11:16,230 --> 04:11:16,690
I'll tear you a new cornshoot.

6068
04:11:16,690 --> 04:11:17,890
He's gonna be here soon.

6069
04:11:19,170 --> 04:11:20,130
He's right here.

6070
04:11:20,230 --> 04:11:20,830
I see him.

6071
04:11:21,350 --> 04:11:22,450
I see him.

6072
04:11:25,750 --> 04:11:26,550
Sweet, guys.

6073
04:11:30,650 --> 04:11:31,350
Oh no.

6074
04:11:32,010 --> 04:11:37,530
Speaker 2 2 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

6075
04:11:39,430 --> 04:11:40,770
Please, as long as you don't hit me.

6076
04:11:40,930 --> 04:11:42,410
As long as you don't hit me.

6077
04:11:42,570 --> 04:11:44,630
As long do not hit me.

6078
04:11:44,770 --> 04:11:45,170
Please.

6079
04:11:45,390 --> 04:11:46,370
Please, for the love of God.

6080
04:11:46,610 --> 04:11:47,210
That's all I ask.

6081
04:11:47,370 --> 04:11:48,350
Do not hit me.

6082
04:11:48,350 --> 04:11:50,030
Dude, do not hit me.

6083
04:11:50,170 --> 04:11:51,310
Do not hit me.

6084
04:11:51,310 --> 04:11:52,930
Do not hit me.

6085
04:11:54,370 --> 04:11:56,110
Oh my god, it's right there.

6086
04:11:56,630 --> 04:11:57,230
No, no.

6087
04:12:04,940 --> 04:12:05,660
AHHHHH!

6088
04:12:12,220 --> 04:12:13,780
It was right there.

6089
04:12:14,140 --> 04:12:16,060
It was right there.

6090
04:12:21,400 --> 04:12:24,680
I saw home for one second.

6091
04:12:27,260 --> 04:12:32,120
I felt like joy for one second and that was all I had.

6092
04:12:32,540 --> 04:12:34,780
That was all I deserved, I guess.

6093
04:12:35,220 --> 04:12:40,960
The one second of joy that made me, made me, that it was possible.

6094
04:12:41,380 --> 04:12:46,100
That made me, made me through, I can feel hope again.

6095
04:12:48,760 --> 04:12:55,360
Just, just made me that life is not, is not as hopeless as I thought it'd be.

6096
04:12:55,360 --> 04:12:57,100
Just maybe.

6097
04:12:59,480 --> 04:13:02,020
It was almost there.

6098
04:13:02,700 --> 04:13:05,440
It truly was so close.

6099
04:13:09,620 --> 04:13:11,740
Oh my god.

6100
04:13:12,100 --> 04:13:13,160
Oh my god.

6101
04:13:13,380 --> 04:13:15,140
If you're gonna bust me.

6102
04:13:15,140 --> 04:13:17,440
Don't let him drive anymore.

6103
04:13:17,760 --> 04:13:17,980
Don't let him drive anymore.

6104
04:13:18,120 --> 04:13:19,140
Don't let him drive anymore.

6105
04:13:20,700 --> 04:13:21,780
Oh, fuck.

6106
04:13:21,980 --> 04:13:22,140
Okay.

6107
04:13:33,630 --> 04:13:34,270
Alright.

6108
04:13:34,410 --> 04:13:34,450
Yeah.

6109
04:13:36,490 --> 04:13:37,130
Alright.

6110
04:13:47,100 --> 04:13:48,540
I'm not okay.

6111
04:13:49,600 --> 04:13:51,240
I'm not okay.

6112
04:13:51,240 --> 04:13:51,320
I'm not okay.

6113
04:13:51,680 --> 04:13:51,740
I'm not okay.

6114
04:13:52,160 --> 04:13:53,860
We were there.

6115
04:13:54,220 --> 04:13:55,380
We were so close.

6116
04:13:55,900 --> 04:13:59,040
We were actually so close.

6117
04:14:01,580 --> 04:14:03,240
That's the worst part.

6118
04:14:03,940 --> 04:14:05,900
I literally, I saw it.

6119
04:14:05,900 --> 04:14:06,360
You dumbass.

6120
04:14:06,360 --> 04:14:08,140
I saw the gate too.

6121
04:14:08,780 --> 04:14:11,100
I saw it in front of me.

6122
04:14:15,250 --> 04:14:17,350
I think that's the worst part.

6123
04:14:17,610 --> 04:14:19,490
When you just, see it.

6124
04:14:20,510 --> 04:14:24,190
And see, just how close you were.

6125
04:14:30,330 --> 04:14:32,610
Just how close everything was.

6126
04:14:35,150 --> 04:14:36,810
Oh, I did the wrong turn.

6127
04:14:37,170 --> 04:14:39,090
I forgot to do that one turn.

6128
04:14:39,450 --> 04:14:40,710
That turn I needed.

6129
04:14:46,160 --> 04:14:47,120
Just don't hit me.

6130
04:14:47,300 --> 04:14:48,280
Just don't hit me.

6131
04:14:48,460 --> 04:14:48,880
Please.

6132
04:14:48,880 --> 04:14:48,960
Please.

6133
04:14:49,660 --> 04:14:49,960
No!

6134
04:14:51,440 --> 04:14:55,290
Back up so low, Pete.

6135
04:14:56,990 --> 04:14:58,470
Let's make the scene.

6136
04:14:59,110 --> 04:15:00,030
Aw, come on.

6137
04:15:00,510 --> 04:15:01,530
You mean I'm going to get more?

6138
04:15:06,660 --> 04:15:07,880
God darn it.

6139
04:15:08,200 --> 04:15:09,240
Eat my dust.

6140
04:15:09,500 --> 04:15:10,700
There's my compass.

6141
04:15:11,380 --> 04:15:12,600
Love it or lose it.

6142
04:15:12,880 --> 04:15:14,800
Back in my game, we call sandwiches.

6143
04:15:15,620 --> 04:15:16,320
Let's bring it.

6144
04:15:16,800 --> 04:15:18,880
It costs more planned cars a bite.

6145
04:15:19,240 --> 04:15:21,240
My cheese fell out.

6146
04:15:23,540 --> 04:15:24,540
No.

6147
04:15:25,240 --> 04:15:27,020
Stupid ghost.

6148
04:15:27,400 --> 04:15:30,720
Stupid fucking ghost!

6149
04:15:39,140 --> 04:15:40,200
Alright, here we go.

6150
04:15:40,340 --> 04:15:41,800
Here we go again.

6151
04:15:42,360 --> 04:15:43,900
Here we go again.

6152
04:15:46,700 --> 04:15:51,360
The thing is... I forgot all the shortcuts going back.

6153
04:15:51,600 --> 04:15:56,100
Because I spent so much time going towards the nuclear power plant.

6154
04:15:56,500 --> 04:16:01,840
That I don't remember what the shortcuts are going back to the school.

6155
04:16:02,220 --> 04:16:04,580
It's been so long.

6156
04:16:05,800 --> 04:16:12,120
We've been... I know every shortcut that goes to the nuclear power plant.

6157
04:16:12,120 --> 04:16:17,360
But I don't remember... I don't remember the other shortcuts.

6158
04:16:17,700 --> 04:16:19,500
It's been 20 years.

6159
04:16:24,640 --> 04:16:26,100
Oh my god.

6160
04:16:27,360 --> 04:16:28,640
Just bust me.

6161
04:16:28,660 --> 04:16:29,760
Just bust me.

6162
04:16:30,280 --> 04:16:32,620
Just put me on the right direction.

6163
04:16:35,520 --> 04:16:37,760
I'll tear you a new corn chute!

6164
04:16:38,260 --> 04:16:39,500
My key fell out!

6165
04:16:40,480 --> 04:16:43,620
Jesus, why is this road so bumpy?!

6166
04:16:44,360 --> 04:16:44,800
Okay.

6167
04:16:45,420 --> 04:16:45,720
Okay.

6168
04:16:46,120 --> 04:16:46,660
Okay.

6169
04:16:50,940 --> 04:16:52,020
I swear to god!

6170
04:16:52,180 --> 04:16:52,820
I swear to god!

6171
04:16:53,100 --> 04:16:53,720
I swear to god!

6172
04:16:55,560 --> 04:17:02,660
I swear to god!

6173
04:17:02,660 --> 04:17:03,160
Oh my god.

6174
04:17:03,280 --> 04:17:03,820
Oh my god.

6175
04:17:03,940 --> 04:17:04,500
Okay, we made it.

6176
04:17:05,560 --> 04:17:05,980
Okay.

6177
04:17:05,980 --> 04:17:08,220
I'm gonna grab the repairs thing right here.

6178
04:17:12,580 --> 04:17:13,000
Okay.

6179
04:17:15,980 --> 04:17:16,560
That's fine.

6180
04:17:16,700 --> 04:17:17,420
We need a repair.

6181
04:17:17,420 --> 04:17:19,900
So much frustration.

6182
04:17:21,300 --> 04:17:23,080
Thank you for the super chat.

6183
04:17:23,260 --> 04:17:24,160
Thank you, thank you.

6184
04:17:25,280 --> 04:17:26,140
Alright, here we go.

6185
04:17:32,020 --> 04:17:33,840
Oh my god, Grandpa.

6186
04:17:34,320 --> 04:17:36,520
No wonder they put you in the home.

6187
04:17:36,520 --> 04:17:38,940
You're actually useless to society.

6188
04:17:39,500 --> 04:17:41,000
Oh my god.

6189
04:17:42,060 --> 04:17:44,840
Putting you in a home is too good for you.

6190
04:17:49,060 --> 04:17:50,940
What did I hit?

6191
04:17:52,580 --> 04:17:54,760
What could I possibly hit?

6192
04:17:57,580 --> 04:18:01,120
I was actually driving on the road!

6193
04:18:02,260 --> 04:18:04,660
At this point, they hit me!

6194
04:18:08,640 --> 04:18:12,720
I swear to god, if someone spawns right in and be like, peekapoo, I swear to god.

6195
04:18:16,380 --> 04:18:17,680
Lousy, generic villains.

6196
04:18:17,940 --> 04:18:17,980
Okay.

6197
04:18:18,960 --> 04:18:21,500
The important thing is I'm not imagining these guys.

6198
04:18:23,960 --> 04:18:24,460
Goodbye!

6199
04:18:29,120 --> 04:18:29,620
Okay.

6200
04:18:32,520 --> 04:18:34,600
Which one is the shortcut?

6201
04:18:34,820 --> 04:18:35,060
It's here.

6202
04:18:35,240 --> 04:18:35,620
It's here.

6203
04:18:35,660 --> 04:18:36,300
That's the shortcut.

6204
04:18:37,020 --> 04:18:38,520
Did I do something wrong?

6205
04:18:38,720 --> 04:18:39,320
That's the shortcut.

6206
04:18:39,460 --> 04:18:39,840
I remember.

6207
04:18:40,840 --> 04:18:41,620
Oh my god.

6208
04:18:41,980 --> 04:18:42,860
Oh my god.

6209
04:18:42,860 --> 04:18:44,700
Oh my god, the lamppost.

6210
04:18:50,620 --> 04:18:51,640
That's a shortcut too.

6211
04:18:55,080 --> 04:18:55,600
No!

6212
04:18:55,960 --> 04:18:56,280
No!

6213
04:18:56,580 --> 04:18:57,800
You can't do this to me!

6214
04:18:57,980 --> 04:18:59,640
You can't do this to me again!

6215
04:19:07,140 --> 04:19:08,180
The lamppost!

6216
04:19:13,670 --> 04:19:16,940
The god damn lamppost!

6217
04:19:18,350 --> 04:19:23,630
The stupid lamppost!

6218
04:19:23,630 --> 04:19:24,530
The stupid lamppost!

6219
04:19:24,530 --> 04:19:25,450
Restarting his face.

6220
04:19:27,330 --> 04:19:30,670
The stupid lamppost!

6221
04:19:30,670 --> 04:19:31,610
The lamppost!

6222
04:19:40,330 --> 04:19:41,990
Oh my god.

6223
04:19:42,470 --> 04:19:43,630
And it's like...

6224
04:19:43,630 --> 04:19:44,550
And it's like the...

6225
04:19:44,550 --> 04:19:44,990
It's like...

6226
04:19:44,990 --> 04:19:45,750
It's just physics!

6227
04:19:46,070 --> 04:19:48,950
I can't control where the lamppost goes!

6228
04:19:49,410 --> 04:19:51,650
My car just snags onto it!

6229
04:19:51,810 --> 04:19:54,230
And then when it snags onto it, there's nothing I can do!

6230
04:19:54,910 --> 04:19:56,610
I'm just on top of it!

6231
04:19:56,710 --> 04:19:57,910
I can't drive anywhere!

6232
04:19:59,610 --> 04:20:01,230
Learn to drive, dumbass!

6233
04:20:01,770 --> 04:20:01,790
Learn to drive, dumbass!

6234
04:20:01,790 --> 04:20:02,110
Oh my god!

6235
04:20:02,450 --> 04:20:03,150
He should...

6236
04:20:03,150 --> 04:20:04,350
Tomer should just take the wheel!

6237
04:20:04,910 --> 04:20:06,190
Grandpa should stop driving!

6238
04:20:06,490 --> 04:20:06,990
At this point!

6239
04:20:07,230 --> 04:20:08,790
Grandpa, you just need to stop driving!

6240
04:20:08,950 --> 04:20:09,310
Like...

6241
04:20:09,310 --> 04:20:09,530
I...

6242
04:20:09,530 --> 04:20:11,850
I don't know why we're still letting you drive!

6243
04:20:12,130 --> 04:20:12,590
I...

6244
04:20:13,710 --> 04:20:16,590
We should be legally allowed to like...

6245
04:20:16,590 --> 04:20:16,890
Yoink!

6246
04:20:17,270 --> 04:20:19,770
Yank the fucking wheel out of this old person's head!

6247
04:20:20,810 --> 04:20:21,410
Like...

6248
04:20:21,410 --> 04:20:22,210
He is...

6249
04:20:22,210 --> 04:20:22,770
He is...

6250
04:20:22,770 --> 04:20:24,350
Dangerous to society!

6251
04:20:25,090 --> 04:20:26,070
God darn it!

6252
04:20:26,730 --> 04:20:29,550
A senior citizen should not be driving anymore!

6253
04:20:30,570 --> 04:20:31,970
That's what Uber is for!

6254
04:20:32,170 --> 04:20:35,690
If your fucking grandpa is still driving, order him an Uber!

6255
04:20:35,850 --> 04:20:36,770
Hide his license!

6256
04:20:37,310 --> 04:20:38,950
He is a dangerous person!

6257
04:20:41,570 --> 04:20:43,310
Just order him an Uber!

6258
04:20:50,070 --> 04:20:51,310
Alright, it's fine.

6259
04:20:51,690 --> 04:20:52,610
It's fine.

6260
04:20:53,350 --> 04:20:54,250
It's fine.

6261
04:20:55,310 --> 04:20:56,470
It's not unethical!

6262
04:20:57,030 --> 04:20:59,490
Letting your grandpa drive is already unethical!

6263
04:21:01,890 --> 04:21:02,570
Alright.

6264
04:21:03,230 --> 04:21:04,130
It's fine.

6265
04:21:04,510 --> 04:21:04,850
We're here.

6266
04:21:06,330 --> 04:21:06,830
Alright.

6267
04:21:07,790 --> 04:21:10,990
Uber doesn't run it like a dream.

6268
04:21:12,430 --> 04:21:15,090
That make him take public transport!

6269
04:21:18,810 --> 04:21:19,370
Alright.

6270
04:21:22,350 --> 04:21:24,790
Let's get the wrench.

6271
04:21:25,050 --> 04:21:25,790
We can go wrench.

6272
04:21:29,710 --> 04:21:30,730
Alright, here we go.

6273
04:21:32,670 --> 04:21:33,630
Alright, here we go.

6274
04:21:37,550 --> 04:21:38,730
Alright, here we go.

6275
04:21:41,130 --> 04:21:41,790
Move it!

6276
04:21:41,850 --> 04:21:42,990
I'm not dead yet!

6277
04:21:44,870 --> 04:21:45,630
Move it!

6278
04:21:47,750 --> 04:21:48,190
Alright.

6279
04:21:49,070 --> 04:21:51,850
Alright, we're gonna get chased by cops here at any moment now.

6280
04:21:52,450 --> 04:21:55,050
Because there's 200 million civilians next to me.

6281
04:21:55,210 --> 04:21:57,230
And it's like, what can I do about it?

6282
04:21:57,430 --> 04:21:57,810
Nothing!

6283
04:21:58,110 --> 04:21:59,750
I can't do anything about it!

6284
04:21:59,930 --> 04:22:00,830
They're just there!

6285
04:22:01,150 --> 04:22:01,990
Standing in the way!

6286
04:22:02,470 --> 04:22:03,610
Just sat- Oh, look at that!

6287
04:22:03,770 --> 04:22:04,310
Oh, wow!

6288
04:22:04,530 --> 04:22:05,210
Okay, thank you!

6289
04:22:05,450 --> 04:22:05,810
Thank you!

6290
04:22:06,050 --> 04:22:06,570
Thank you!

6291
04:22:08,670 --> 04:22:10,270
Eat my dust!

6292
04:22:11,890 --> 04:22:13,410
Alright, we go back.

6293
04:22:17,250 --> 04:22:18,450
We go back.

6294
04:22:22,470 --> 04:22:22,970
Oh!

6295
04:22:25,530 --> 04:22:27,150
Maybe not run them over.

6296
04:22:27,350 --> 04:22:29,150
Maybe don't stand in front of my car!

6297
04:22:35,190 --> 04:22:38,010
Maybe go back to that grave where you belong!

6298
04:22:38,670 --> 04:22:40,530
Nobody told you to come to the surface!

6299
04:22:42,170 --> 04:22:43,670
You lived your life!

6300
04:22:44,050 --> 04:22:45,430
Now stay in the ground!

6301
04:22:46,290 --> 04:22:47,810
Nobody wants you here!

6302
04:22:48,530 --> 04:22:49,910
You've lived your life!

6303
04:22:49,910 --> 04:22:51,130
Please come back!

6304
04:22:51,210 --> 04:22:52,170
I'm so lonely!

6305
04:22:56,050 --> 04:22:56,510
Alright.

6306
04:22:56,930 --> 04:22:57,010
Move it!

6307
04:22:57,110 --> 04:22:58,070
I'm not dead yet!

6308
04:22:58,190 --> 04:22:58,770
It's fine.

6309
04:22:59,890 --> 04:23:00,690
It's fine.

6310
04:23:02,650 --> 04:23:03,110
It's fine.

6311
04:23:04,190 --> 04:23:04,770
It's fine.

6312
04:23:04,770 --> 04:23:04,890
It's fine.

6313
04:23:05,910 --> 04:23:06,990
We're here now.

6314
04:23:07,210 --> 04:23:09,230
That adrenaline make me feel alive again!

6315
04:23:09,450 --> 04:23:10,150
Move it, you motherfucker!

6316
04:23:13,390 --> 04:23:17,210
I swear to God, if I see Carl walking towards me one more time, I'm gonna run him over.

6317
04:23:22,250 --> 04:23:23,510
Alright, and then there's him.

6318
04:23:24,490 --> 04:23:25,590
Get out of my way!

6319
04:23:25,930 --> 04:23:27,530
Every minute might be my last!

6320
04:23:28,450 --> 04:23:30,110
Okay, we're gonna let him chase us a little.

6321
04:23:30,370 --> 04:23:32,890
We call sandwiches, Glad Freddy!

6322
04:23:33,830 --> 04:23:35,850
Okay, maybe I shouldn't let him chase us, guys.

6323
04:23:36,330 --> 04:23:37,870
Cause now, I don't know what to do.

6324
04:23:38,450 --> 04:23:40,470
Now, I think we made a mistake.

6325
04:23:40,830 --> 04:23:42,130
Letting him chase us.

6326
04:23:44,050 --> 04:23:44,490
Wee!

6327
04:23:45,430 --> 04:23:45,870
Wee!

6328
04:23:47,550 --> 04:23:48,310
Oh my god.

6329
04:23:48,750 --> 04:23:49,610
Oh my god.

6330
04:23:49,790 --> 04:23:49,890
Okay.

6331
04:23:50,330 --> 04:23:50,770
That's fine.

6332
04:23:53,410 --> 04:23:55,730
Okay, we made a mistake letting him chase us.

6333
04:23:55,890 --> 04:23:57,890
We made a mistake letting him chase us.

6334
04:23:58,010 --> 04:23:59,330
Cause now, he's like there.

6335
04:23:59,870 --> 04:24:00,310
Now...

6336
04:24:00,310 --> 04:24:02,410
Now, he's just there.

6337
04:24:03,510 --> 04:24:03,950
Wait.

6338
04:24:04,390 --> 04:24:04,410
Wait.

6339
04:24:05,190 --> 04:24:05,630
Oh

6340
04:24:16,400 --> 04:24:16,600
my god!

6341
04:24:17,200 --> 04:24:18,040
Oh my god!

6342
04:24:19,180 --> 04:24:20,500
Oh my god, I did it!

6343
04:24:20,500 --> 04:24:22,620
Oh my god, I did it!

6344
04:24:24,460 --> 04:24:25,240
Oh!

6345
04:24:25,440 --> 04:24:26,700
Goodbye, Grandpa!

6346
04:24:27,120 --> 04:24:28,340
Never come back!

6347
04:24:28,780 --> 04:24:30,580
Never come back!

6348
04:24:33,550 --> 04:24:37,150
Eat nuclear death, you effeminate wriggling space wads!

6349
04:24:37,250 --> 04:24:41,030
I'm so thankful for the super chat that gets so cute to hurt me, bud.

6350
04:24:45,010 --> 04:24:47,110
Oh, cut your fingernails!

6351
04:24:47,310 --> 04:24:48,290
Oh, shit!

6352
04:24:48,690 --> 04:24:49,050
Nice!

6353
04:24:49,870 --> 04:24:50,710
Three hands!

6354
04:24:50,710 --> 04:24:53,170
That fortune teller was right.

6355
04:24:53,350 --> 04:24:56,450
I do end up dying in a spaceship crash.

6356
04:24:58,410 --> 04:24:59,410
Oh my god!

6357
04:24:59,490 --> 04:25:00,190
He did it!

6358
04:25:01,050 --> 04:25:02,090
Polish earthlings!

6359
04:25:02,550 --> 04:25:03,410
Space ring and Sora!

6360
04:25:03,790 --> 04:25:06,870
I'm really proud of you for rescuing us all from that alien invasion!

6361
04:25:07,410 --> 04:25:08,570
Did that really happen?

6362
04:25:08,750 --> 04:25:11,790
I thought it was a bad dream after eating too many raw hot dogs.

6363
04:25:11,790 --> 04:25:13,350
No, homie!

6364
04:25:13,490 --> 04:25:14,710
You're the town hero!

6365
04:25:14,710 --> 04:25:14,730
Wait!

6366
04:25:14,930 --> 04:25:15,670
You're the town hero!

6367
04:25:16,430 --> 04:25:17,510
And the ninja babysitters?

6368
04:25:18,190 --> 04:25:19,710
Was that real or a hot dog dream?

6369
04:25:19,890 --> 04:25:20,390
Hot dog dream!

6370
04:25:20,390 --> 04:25:21,910
Thank you for the super chat!

6371
04:25:22,270 --> 04:25:23,290
Thank you for the super chat!

6372
04:25:23,670 --> 04:25:24,190
Yay!

6373
04:25:25,530 --> 04:25:26,050
Dragoons!

6374
04:25:28,050 --> 04:25:29,370
Thank you, so serious!

6375
04:25:29,370 --> 04:25:30,090
Thank you, dragoons!

6376
04:25:30,470 --> 04:25:30,890
Oh, that was weird!

6377
04:25:30,890 --> 04:25:31,710
One at a time!

6378
04:25:32,410 --> 04:25:33,370
One at a time!

6379
04:25:33,870 --> 04:25:34,530
Dragoons!

6380
04:25:34,790 --> 04:25:35,790
One at a time!

6381
04:25:36,690 --> 04:25:37,050
Yes!

6382
04:25:37,470 --> 04:25:38,890
Your hero is here!

6383
04:25:39,850 --> 04:25:41,510
Your hero is here!

6384
04:25:42,850 --> 04:25:44,770
Ricky, thank you so much of the super chatити!

6385
04:25:44,870 --> 04:25:45,310
Thank you, thank you!

6386
04:25:45,990 --> 04:25:52,130
Why did we go to heaven when weасибо we don't have to sit trough the stupid video game credits?

6387
04:25:59,530 --> 04:25:59,930
Ohhhh...

6388
04:25:59,930 --> 04:26:02,030
Evie thank you for the super chat, thank you- Thank you!

6389
04:26:02,910 --> 04:26:04,330
Jimmyhh... Thank you for the super chat.

6390
04:26:05,210 --> 04:26:05,970
And I'm too smart.

6391
04:26:06,110 --> 04:26:06,170
I'm too smart.

6392
04:26:06,170 --> 04:26:07,430
Thank you for the 500 ships!

6393
04:26:07,790 --> 04:26:09,310
Don't forget them.

6394
04:26:10,070 --> 04:26:12,170
Silverwish... Thank you for the super chat... Thank you, thank you!

6395
04:26:12,170 --> 04:26:18,090
The current world record speed run for this game is one hour and 15 minutes by Homer of Steel.

6396
04:26:18,690 --> 04:26:21,210
The other drone scuttle and run...

6397
04:26:21,210 --> 04:26:22,090
Trigo, see you this.

6398
04:26:22,230 --> 04:26:22,850
Rich hat, thank you.

6399
04:26:23,010 --> 04:26:23,510
Thank you.

6400
04:26:23,690 --> 04:26:26,130
This whole stream felt like a hot dog dream.

6401
04:26:27,310 --> 04:26:31,770
If you ask me if humans spent too much time exchanging long protein strands...

6402
04:26:31,770 --> 04:26:32,350
I'm so happy.

6403
04:26:34,090 --> 04:26:37,010
That last level was absolute hell.

6404
04:26:37,550 --> 04:26:39,250
That last level.

6405
04:26:39,250 --> 04:26:45,250
I thought... I legitimately thought I was gonna hit the baseball cage.

6406
04:26:45,790 --> 04:26:51,350
My life flashed before me when I saw myself going towards the baseball cage.

6407
04:26:51,570 --> 04:26:52,990
And I was like, no.

6408
04:26:53,730 --> 04:26:54,390
I would...

6409
04:26:54,390 --> 04:26:56,250
No, if I lose...

6410
04:26:57,070 --> 04:26:59,350
If I lose it...

6411
04:27:00,610 --> 04:27:02,990
I would have actually turned off my game.

6412
04:27:03,150 --> 04:27:06,870
If I hit that cage and it fucking exploded.

6413
04:27:10,230 --> 04:27:11,090
That was...

6414
04:27:11,090 --> 04:27:13,570
That was gonna be my breaking point.

6415
04:27:13,730 --> 04:27:16,350
You know how, like, everybody has that one thing?

6416
04:27:16,750 --> 04:27:19,670
The one thing that makes them break?

6417
04:27:19,930 --> 04:27:21,290
That would have been my...

6418
04:27:21,290 --> 04:27:23,710
That would have been my 13th reason.

6419
04:27:23,710 --> 04:27:24,650
That...

6420
04:27:28,070 --> 04:27:32,030
That would have been it after everything I went through.

6421
04:27:32,750 --> 04:27:33,230
Snaz.

6422
04:27:33,310 --> 04:27:34,330
Thank you for the super chat.

6423
04:27:34,510 --> 04:27:35,010
Thank you.

6424
04:27:35,170 --> 04:27:35,710
Thank you.

6425
04:27:35,990 --> 04:27:39,710
You did it long and prosper in 1939.

6426
04:27:41,230 --> 04:27:42,550
Thank you for the super chat.

6427
04:27:42,670 --> 04:27:42,950
Thank you.

6428
04:27:42,950 --> 04:27:43,650
Thank you.

6429
04:27:44,950 --> 04:27:45,330
Thank you.

6430
04:27:45,550 --> 04:27:46,410
Thank you for the super chat.

6431
04:27:46,510 --> 04:27:46,730
Thank you.

6432
04:27:46,850 --> 04:27:47,230
Thank you.

6433
04:27:47,370 --> 04:27:50,230
Imagine tapping up before reaching the school.

6434
04:27:51,010 --> 04:27:51,390
Dory.

6435
04:27:51,690 --> 04:27:52,570
Thank you for the super chat.

6436
04:27:52,670 --> 04:27:52,930
Thank you.

6437
04:27:53,030 --> 04:27:53,630
Thank you.

6438
04:27:53,990 --> 04:27:57,350
After watching this, I think you should do more driving games.

6439
04:27:58,130 --> 04:27:58,510
Krish.

6440
04:27:58,590 --> 04:28:00,030
Thank you for the five gifted chips.

6441
04:28:00,170 --> 04:28:00,370
Thank you.

6442
04:28:00,470 --> 04:28:00,810
Thank you.

6443
04:28:00,850 --> 04:28:01,030
Yup.

6444
04:28:01,950 --> 04:28:03,190
Thank you for the super chat.

6445
04:28:03,270 --> 04:28:03,450
Thank you.

6446
04:28:03,710 --> 04:28:05,010
Congrats on clearing the game.

6447
04:28:05,190 --> 04:28:06,050
Thank you guys.

6448
04:28:06,050 --> 04:28:07,330
Thank you all for watching.

6449
04:28:08,010 --> 04:28:13,270
Thank you all for going through pure hell with me today.

6450
04:28:13,630 --> 04:28:16,030
I really appreciate it, guys.

6451
04:28:16,330 --> 04:28:17,470
We did it.

6452
04:28:17,630 --> 04:28:19,370
We went through so much.

6453
04:28:20,010 --> 04:28:22,350
Grandpa Simpson, you're alive.

6454
04:28:22,570 --> 04:28:22,830
No!

6455
04:28:23,350 --> 04:28:24,330
Go back!

6456
04:28:24,590 --> 04:28:26,610
Go back into the beam.

6457
04:28:26,910 --> 04:28:28,110
Never come back.

6458
04:28:28,990 --> 04:28:29,550
Bye.

6459
04:28:29,730 --> 04:28:30,650
Thank you for the super chat.

6460
04:28:30,790 --> 04:28:30,990
Thank you.

6461
04:28:31,130 --> 04:28:31,690
Thank you.

6462
04:28:32,230 --> 04:28:35,270
Buy yourself a flatbreadie after this.

6463
04:28:35,270 --> 04:28:36,650
Holy fuck.

6464
04:28:37,090 --> 04:28:38,010
Oh!

6465
04:28:38,590 --> 04:28:40,550
I'm so happy it's over.

6466
04:28:40,990 --> 04:28:43,390
We finished two games this week.

6467
04:28:43,630 --> 04:28:45,710
I'm so proud of us.

6468
04:28:46,330 --> 04:28:48,390
We finished two games.

6469
04:28:50,550 --> 04:28:54,530
So many ups and downs.

6470
04:28:55,170 --> 04:28:55,990
Mostly downs.

6471
04:28:56,530 --> 04:28:58,610
But we made it.

6472
04:28:59,930 --> 04:29:02,410
We fucking made it, chat.

6473
04:29:04,830 --> 04:29:05,970
Oh my god.

6474
04:29:06,290 --> 04:29:07,390
I'm so happy.

6475
04:29:08,490 --> 04:29:10,070
I'm so happy.

6476
04:29:12,570 --> 04:29:13,990
Thomas, thank you for the super chat.

6477
04:29:14,110 --> 04:29:14,330
Thank you.

6478
04:29:14,430 --> 04:29:14,790
Thank you.

6479
04:29:14,970 --> 04:29:15,490
No joke.

6480
04:29:15,610 --> 04:29:17,850
The baseball caching happened to me as a kid.

6481
04:29:18,570 --> 04:29:21,390
And it was the first time in my life I've ever tried.

6482
04:29:26,070 --> 04:29:27,750
My life flashed.

6483
04:29:27,770 --> 04:29:29,270
I felt like when I was in slow mode.

6484
04:29:29,490 --> 04:29:31,510
When I was heading towards that baseball cage.

6485
04:29:32,050 --> 04:29:34,330
I was like, it was slow-mo for me.

6486
04:29:34,490 --> 04:29:36,510
I was like, this would have been it.

6487
04:29:36,650 --> 04:29:39,810
This would have been my 13th reason if I hit this cage.

6488
04:29:40,090 --> 04:29:43,850
Like, I had like, like, all my years pass by.

6489
04:29:43,850 --> 04:29:46,250
It flashed before me.

6490
04:29:46,390 --> 04:29:48,690
As I slowly went towards the cage.

6491
04:29:48,950 --> 04:29:50,190
I was like, oh no.

6492
04:29:50,450 --> 04:29:51,230
This is it.

6493
04:29:51,650 --> 04:29:52,710
This is sucking it.

6494
04:29:58,290 --> 04:29:58,750
Unlucky.

6495
04:29:58,970 --> 04:29:59,890
Thank you for the super chat.

6496
04:30:00,030 --> 04:30:00,230
Thank you.

6497
04:30:00,350 --> 04:30:00,870
Thank you.

6498
04:30:01,530 --> 04:30:03,410
Now I can finally put this game to rest.

6499
04:30:03,670 --> 04:30:06,670
By that, I mean, delete it and never mention it again.

6500
04:30:07,990 --> 04:30:09,430
Robin, thank you for the super chat.

6501
04:30:09,570 --> 04:30:09,770
Thank you.

6502
04:30:09,870 --> 04:30:10,290
Thank you.

6503
04:30:11,170 --> 04:30:12,150
Now you have to find a secret.

6504
04:30:12,750 --> 04:30:12,990
Cars.

6505
04:30:13,250 --> 04:30:13,410
Nope.

6506
04:30:13,750 --> 04:30:14,390
It's over.

6507
04:30:14,950 --> 04:30:15,510
It's over.

6508
04:30:15,830 --> 04:30:17,050
Because we finished the game.

6509
04:30:17,190 --> 04:30:18,170
I'm changing the title.

6510
04:30:18,390 --> 04:30:19,930
I'm changing to we finished.

6511
04:30:20,290 --> 04:30:21,410
We finished it.

6512
04:30:21,650 --> 04:30:21,970
Thank you.

6513
04:30:22,070 --> 04:30:22,470
Come again.

6514
04:30:25,310 --> 04:30:26,530
Thank you for the super chat.

6515
04:30:26,630 --> 04:30:26,810
Thank you.

6516
04:30:26,970 --> 04:30:27,370
Thank you.

6517
04:30:27,370 --> 04:30:35,090
Virion, thank you for the super chat, thank you, congrats, you beat the mission that made child me quit the game almost 20 years ago.

6518
04:30:38,590 --> 04:30:42,330
How long is this credit?

6519
04:30:46,770 --> 04:30:49,590
Oh, I'm just happy it's over.

6520
04:30:50,530 --> 04:30:51,970
I'm so happy.

6521
04:30:52,310 --> 04:30:53,510
Oh my god.

6522
04:30:53,510 --> 04:31:00,310
That was actual pure joy when I saw the car get up the beam.

6523
04:31:00,590 --> 04:31:04,670
I feel like this was the happiest I've ever been in 2025.

6524
04:31:09,710 --> 04:31:11,530
I was like, it's over.

6525
04:31:12,090 --> 04:31:14,810
This was actually the happiest I've ever been.

6526
04:31:17,510 --> 04:31:20,170
I was like, it's finally over.

6527
04:31:20,750 --> 04:31:23,510
Sir, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

6528
04:31:23,630 --> 04:31:27,450
You did it, you saved the city from the alien invasion.

6529
04:31:28,070 --> 04:31:30,410
Hunter exploded, nuclear waste barrels everywhere.

6530
04:31:31,310 --> 04:31:32,910
It's their fault!

6531
04:31:33,490 --> 04:31:35,930
They keep wrapping it to me!

6532
04:31:38,470 --> 04:31:40,430
Demo, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

6533
04:31:40,570 --> 04:31:42,210
Thank you, never come back.

6534
04:31:45,930 --> 04:31:47,750
Oh, I'm so happy.

6535
04:31:48,070 --> 04:31:49,430
Oh my god.

6536
04:31:50,070 --> 04:31:51,810
I'm actually, I'm so happy.

6537
04:31:52,150 --> 04:31:54,450
I felt like I was on a time loop.

6538
04:31:54,650 --> 04:31:57,070
I felt like I was actually time looping.

6539
04:31:57,890 --> 04:32:05,070
Every time I fucking just saw the nuclear waste explode, I was like, this is it.

6540
04:32:05,770 --> 04:32:07,210
This is my bad day.

6541
04:32:07,550 --> 04:32:09,230
This nightmare will never end.

6542
04:32:09,790 --> 04:32:11,330
This nightmare...

6543
04:32:11,920 --> 04:32:13,410
This nightmare will never end.

6544
04:32:13,690 --> 04:32:14,390
This is it.

6545
04:32:15,810 --> 04:32:16,850
Oh, save!

6546
04:32:17,490 --> 04:32:19,650
That was my groundhog day.

6547
04:32:21,130 --> 04:32:21,750
Oh.

6548
04:32:23,090 --> 04:32:24,170
What a day.

6549
04:32:24,730 --> 04:32:25,710
What a fuck.

6550
04:32:25,850 --> 04:32:27,950
I tabbed out because I know it's over now.

6551
04:32:30,070 --> 04:32:31,890
Thank you, everybody, for coming.

6552
04:32:32,390 --> 04:32:35,510
I hope you guys had a great time watching, everyone.

6553
04:32:36,190 --> 04:32:36,710
I...

6554
04:32:37,850 --> 04:32:40,830
I survived the great Simpsons hit and run.

6555
04:32:41,110 --> 04:32:41,510
I...

6556
04:32:41,510 --> 04:32:43,150
I survived.

6557
04:32:44,730 --> 04:32:48,350
We survived the Simpsons hit and run game.

6558
04:32:48,750 --> 04:32:50,290
We did it, everyone.

6559
04:32:50,690 --> 04:32:53,150
I'm gonna call it now for today.

6560
04:32:53,590 --> 04:32:55,170
Tomorrow's a very long day for me.

6561
04:32:55,170 --> 04:32:56,590
So I gotta prepare for...

6562
04:32:56,590 --> 04:32:58,110
I gotta head to bed early.

6563
04:32:58,390 --> 04:33:02,150
Well, I got to walk, Dad, and then head to bed after that.

6564
04:33:02,370 --> 04:33:03,630
But thank you, everybody, for coming.

6565
04:33:03,910 --> 04:33:06,550
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

6566
04:33:06,870 --> 04:33:07,430
Posture check.

6567
04:33:07,630 --> 04:33:09,790
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

6568
04:33:10,330 --> 04:33:12,810
If you, except for me, head to bed.

6569
04:33:12,950 --> 04:33:14,610
Cause you deserve it.

6570
04:33:14,830 --> 04:33:16,510
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

6571
04:33:16,890 --> 04:33:17,750
Bye, guys!

6572
04:33:18,170 --> 04:33:18,610
Bye!
