Is it cat dip or, like, weed?

27
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,410
I don't, I didn't look at it.

28
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,710
I was just like, meow, wana.

29
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:25,090
Anyway, that's why I blurred it because I was like, that's
weird.

00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:29,710
I'm going to blur in case people are like, what the fuck is
your dog doing next to meow, wana?

34
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:52,470
catnip is i don't know i don't own a cat so i don't know
what catnip actually does does to cats um i thought it was

00:05:52,470 --> 00:06:00,210
just a little treat like food or some shit i don't know i
never owned a cat before but he also got this and and i got

Isn't that cute?

42
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,970
I don't even have a couch.

43
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,330
But my dog has a couch.

44
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:40,750
That's so fucking sad.

45
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,430
I don't even own furniture.

46
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,690
Like, I barely own any furniture.

47
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,670
But I bought my dog a couch, though.

48
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,310
Like, that's money well spent.

49
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,330
Not gonna lie.

50
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,810
I don't need furniture.

51
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,670
But I think my dog does.

52
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,130
It's perfectly sized for my dog.

53
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:02,950
It's so cute.

54
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:14,130
yeah we went on a little shopping trip me and my dog spent
like 300 200 um i was like was it 300 or 200 um i got one of

55
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:22,810
my cars to climb and that was a little worrying but it was
the it was from that stupid fucking bank i hate that bank so

56
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:32,450
much anyway i have to use my other card because i was like
bro it's 200 like um no i didn't call my bank because i was

57
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,190
like why the Fuck did you decline?

58
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,830
There's a lot of money on that account.

59
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:41,570
I was like, I was like, there's no way the account is empty.

60
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,670
There's a lot of money in that account.

61
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,910
So I was just like, how did I get declined?

62
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:47,870
So I don't know.

63
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:48,450
Fuck that.

64
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,670
I hate that bank so much.

65
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:58,330
Anyway, it was like two, like I spent 200, I mean, 200
Canadian Buccaroonies on this dog today.

66
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,330
So it's like, I don't know.

67
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,030
Maybe it's like 10 American dollars.

68
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:11,450
I can't tell I heard the American dollar currency is also
falling so yeah I mean that's bad because America the

69
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:19,510
economy sort of relies on American dollar so I feel like
that's sort of bad especially for Canada because our also

70
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:31,950
our currency has been falling for a while so not yay I was
like not yay guys not yay because the rest of the world is

71
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:36,250
so Because, um, I don't, okay, here, here's a little fun
history, uh, fact.

72
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:47,570
Um, in the past, currency was tied to gold because, um,
because that was the easiest way to balance things to, like,

73
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,730
I guess, currency conversion and a way to, like, what's it
called, stabilize, like, the dollar.

74
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,010
So everything was connected to gold.

75
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:57,790
And then America came along and was like, fuck that shit.

76
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,030
We didn't, fuck God.

77
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:09,030
currency and then they like they uh they basically got rid
of the gold stat it was called the gold standard and they

78
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:15,850
got rid of that because they're like we're the center of the
world and then now we follow uh now we follow the american

79
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:30,720
dollar and the american dollar is sort of falling right now
and i don't like that i i i'm a little concerned now

80
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:51,180
not sure if it's the best decision in hindsight uh yeah if
we go down everyone goes down with us that's true that's

81
00:09:51,180 --> 00:10:00,020
true that's true america does like to do that um as as
america's neighbor we have experienced that quite a lot to

82
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:05,840
be fair uh but hey hey we get to be in the World Cup,
though.

83
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,040
Canada gets to be in the World Cup!

84
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:08,560
Yeah!

85
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,580
At least we get to be included in the pros and the cons.

86
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,020
We'll take those.

87
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,900
Gordon, thank you for the super chat.

88
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:22,880

Welcome!

91
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,880
Fun fact, most of the presents on the dollar bills were
completely against the Federal Reserve.

92
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:44,900
Thank you for the super chat thank you thank you yeah we
ride or die baby like currency's fucked but world cup whoo

93
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:58,860
i'm sorry my country is like this um anyway uh so yeah it's
a little a little concerning so she'll have a lot of

94
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:04,500
american dollars in my bank account right now but at least
they'll always be better than the Canadian dollar at least

95
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:11,660
that's my positive here Canadian dollar at least with the
American dollar falling the Canadian dollar is also falling

96
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:22,920
and I still have my American Bukaroonies in my account so I
should really start getting gold I should maybe you know

97
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:29,140
maybe the people are right you know how they're like no
don't trust the banks just buy gold maybe I should have done

98
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:38,020
that maybe Maybe, maybe, maybe I should have listened to the
tinfoil ads.

99
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:38,480
Oh,

100
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,280

Thank you, thank you.

102

The USD was so backed by Go until 1971.

103
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,400
The economy going bad can be traced back to that.

104
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,940
Thank you for the super chat.

105
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,840

Alright, more lore.

00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:27,850
Yeah, it was completely annihilated.

201

No, Nirmal's a dude.

202
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,430
Nirmal's always been a dude.

203
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:42,900
Oh.

204
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,720

Sonsfield!

206
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,250
I dream you never showed up here.

207
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,530
We had a good thing going on.

208
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,110
But in typical Nerman fashion, you've ruined everything.

209
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,630
I try to tell everyone should kick you up.

210
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:08,090
But they convinced me to let you to stay.

211
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,110
You were just a cute little kid and after all.

212
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,790
Now they're all gone and I'm stuck with this mess to clean
up.

213
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,070
I hate these.

214
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:16,670
right.

215
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:20,030
Almost as much as I hate Mondays.

216
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:22,310
That's right.

217
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,830
I know your true nature.

218
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:29,510
Didn't think you could become more annoying, but you found a
way.

219
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,410
Tell you what, I'll show you a little mercy.

220
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,330
Give up, get out of here, and don't come back.

221
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:37,370
Normal.

222
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,310
That's your answer?

223
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,430
You really think you can beat me?

224
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:45,990
He knows.

225
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,810
Nirmal is secretly Monday!

226
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,690
I'm gonna enjoy teaching you the pecking order.

227
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,440
Oh my god, I'm filled with determination right now.

228
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,040
It's too bad I'm fucking Nirmal.

229
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,520
Show me what you got!

230
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,920
He's gonna have a bad Monday!

231
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,080
Let me guess.

232
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,620
Not done yet.

233
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,850
You sure you want to lose again?

234
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,220
Yeah, it's going to be hard to cheer for normal now.

235
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,640
Knowing that I'm actually normal.

236
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,020
It's going to be very hard, guys.

237
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,520
I thought I was someone else.

238
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,000
But I just had to be normal.

239
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,280

What did I get?

252
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,260
Nirmal was visited by the pasta fairy.

253
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,500

317
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:23,840
That's fine.

318
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,180
I looked at chat for one second.

319
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:29,640
What?

320
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:34,330
Okay.

321
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:36,370

00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,090
Oh, 31.

00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,110
That's a good attack.

00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:48,490
Oh, I don't remember.

327
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:48,870

00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:51,850
Not nice.

332
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:52,230
Not nice.

333
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,350
Not nice.

334
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:55,890
Okay.

335
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,670
Um, I could do another hit.

336
00:24:58,850 --> 00:24:59,330

337
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:00,590
We're halfway there.

00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:03,170

00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,330
I'm getting better, guys.

00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,650
Okay, halfway, we're halfway.

344
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,030
Oh, God.

345
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:19,670
No!

346
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:21,410
Oh, all right.

347
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,650
I think I got you a lasagna.

348
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,190
I think it's lasagna time.

349
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:31,450
100 HP.

350
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,070
Okay, good, good, good.

351
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,070
It's an OD.

352
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,110
That's almost messed up there.

353
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,550
Oh, oh, he's getting closer.

354
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,980
Oh, no, not again.

355
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,360
Where is my pipe?

356
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:05,690
Oh, God.

357
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:11,630
Okay, okay, okay.

358
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,510
That's, you know, 20 damage, 20 damage.

359
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,450
I'll take those.

360
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,230
That's the lowest I ever got.

361
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:17,950
Oh,

362
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:25,030

00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:25,690
Okay, okay.

364
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,370
I got that disoriented there.

365
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,670

366
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:31,810

368
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:48,930

Okay, here you go.

377
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,580
It's a tutorial.

378
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,980
Where is my fun?

379
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,720
Yeah, I definitely got you in the lasagna here.

380
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:03,100
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, no, I definitely need a lasagna.

381
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,180
Om, yom, yom, yom.

00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:09,080
I swear to God, if it gives me another...

383
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,340
Where is my pipe after this?

384
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,680
Thank God.

385
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,240
As long as it's not pipe.

386
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:14,940
Ah!

387
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,300
Okay, that's on me.

388
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,700
That's on it.

389
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,340
I messed up there a little.

390
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,080
Just a little.

391
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,920
Just a little.

392
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,470
Jesus Christ.

393
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,430
Why are you kicking it closer?

394
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:38,790
Okay.

00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:41,590
There you go.

396
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,710
I think I activate phase two here.

397
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:46,710
There you go.

398
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,690
He's in phase two.

399
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,370
And then they're going to give me a sheep's red.

400
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,180
Oh.

401
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:58,920

428
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,820
Where is my fight?

429
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:03,310
Don't you hate it when you just stub your toes like five
times in a row?

00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,910
Oh my god, that's...

Oh, I've never had that happen before.

432
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,630
See guys, I can improve.

433
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:12,570
It is possible.

434
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,210

00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:41,740
Never mind.

498
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,180
One last pipe.

00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,800
Where is my pipe?

500
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,320
Oh, nice.

00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:01,700
Zero hits.

502
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,880
Don't worry about that lasagna I ate earlier.

503
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,780
That never happened.

504
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,020
Please be sheep.

505
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:08,700
Please be sheep.

506
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:09,700
Oh my god.

507
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,900
It's okay.

508
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,620
Yay!

509
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:32,780
Okay.

510
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,980
Are you fucking?

511
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:35,740
Okay, it's okay.

512
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:36,820
I pray.

513
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:40,260
Spaghetti!

00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,100
Yeah!

517
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,120
Okay.

518
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,180
Oh my god.

519
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,860
That's a lot of lasagna.

520
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:06,840
Okay, that's good.

521
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:07,280
That's good.

522
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,960
That's actually huge.

523
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,260
That's actually...

524
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:14,360
I did not realize she gave me, like, an entire year's supply
of lasagna.

525
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,620
That's actually crazy.

526
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:23,680
Okay.

527
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,280
I pray.

528
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,720

Nice.

597
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,300

Pray to the gods.

613
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:44,620
No!

614
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,220
That's- that's okay.

615
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:50,680
That's okay.

616
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,840
Just- that means I just gotta do it one more time.

617
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,560
Oh, no.

618
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,560

00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:02,380
Spaghetti.

622
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:07,820
Spaghetti.

623
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,720
Guys, I don't think this is the run, guys.

624
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,800
This may or may not be the run.

625
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:15,500
Okay.

626
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,060
Pray.

627
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,800
Pray to the pastor, lords.

628
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,220
Oh, that's okay.

629
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,520
That's fine.

630
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,580
That's why I still have one more spaghetti, guys.

631
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,180
spaghetti.

632
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,200
I have one more spaghetti in a dream.

633
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,800
It's all on me.

634
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,920
I get cross-eyed playing this part.

635
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,020
This one is actually so fucking crazy.

636
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,660
I actually get cross-eyed.

637
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:06,230
But maybe the past gods will smile.

638
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:06,870
Yay!

639
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:11,950

00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:49,010
Okay, that's...

652
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:49,250
Spaghetti!

653
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:53,110
That was not cool.

654
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,580
What is this?

655
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:00,500
Oh!

656
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:01,600
Whoops.

657
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,400
Oh, whoops.

658
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:07,480
Oh.

659
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:11,980
Spaghetti!

660
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:17,740
At least I still have my spaghetti, guys.

661
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:23,320
Guys, don't worry, I'll eventually make my move.

662
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:27,980
I wish it just gives me that six times in a row.

663
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,800
That would have been nice.

664
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:31,820
Okay, nice.

665
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,640
I finally got, like, a freebie.

666
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,340
The 28 damage freebie.

667
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,340
Oh, shit.

668
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,380
I got confused there.

669
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,020
A lot of things were happening on my screen, guys.

670
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:51,340
Bye-bye.

671
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:55,740
Oh, shit.

672
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:58,180
Oh.

673
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:02,810
I dodged that.

674
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:05,590
She has a gun.

675
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:12,390
He has a fucking gun.

676
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:13,830
He shot me.

677
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:18,470
Where is my butt?

678
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,100
Okay, I can't believe that.

679
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:27,860
Like, how?

680
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:32,120
There you go.

681
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,160
I got touched by the cloud, but there we go.

682
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:34,580
That's it.

683
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:35,820
I'm angry.

684
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,240
Yeah.

685
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:48,720
Oh, okay.

686
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:49,240
That's fine.

687
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,120
His toe touched me.

688
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:50,680
That's okay.

689
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,740
I just stubbed my toe on Odis.

690
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:54,120
On Odis' toe.

691
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,540
We both suffered today.

692
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:06,540
That's okay.

693
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,120
Lasagna.

694
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,360
You know how I eat spaghetti?

695
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:10,040
I don't know how to eat lasagna.

696
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:17,820
Okay.

697
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:19,580
That's cool.

698
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:20,720
Okay.

699
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,440
I'll just stay here.

700
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:25,900
Moving was a mistake.

701
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,520
Fuck me, I guess.

702
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:33,130
Oh.

00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:36,150
Nice.

704
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:39,150
Oh, I wish they just gave me that and Odie.

705
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:40,910
Like, seven times in a row.

706
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:43,630
Instead of where is my pipe?

707
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:47,110
Where is my pipe?

708
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:00,830
There we go.

721
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:36,310
Symmetry.

I'm okay.

00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:05,190
It's okay.

741
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:05,590
It's okay.

742
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:07,730
We pray.

743
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,690
We pray to the pasta fairy.

744
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:11,590
All right.

745
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:13,070
That's all right.

746
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:26,370
Oh my.

747
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:30,110
Oh, yeah, no, that's lasagna time.

748
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:31,810
That's a lasagna.

749
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,280
Oh.

750
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:43,840
Okay.

751
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,680
The past of gods will pray upon me.

752
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:48,720
Oh, that's okay.

753
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:49,540
That's 10 HP.

754
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:50,860
That's 10 HP.

755
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:51,560
That's okay.

756
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:53,860
That's all right.

757
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:55,640
But, please.

758
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,540
Oh, oh, oh.

759
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,440
Maybe the past.

760
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,060
Pesta?

761
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,400
God damn it.

762
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,340
Stop fucking throwing rocks at a cat!

763
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,140
Stop throwing raft rocks at the local cat, guys!

764
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,440
It's not helping me!

765
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:21,800
You're not helping!

766
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:35,230
God, oh, this is the first time I've, like, got hit by
those.

767
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:37,470
It just makes me so cross-eyed.

768
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:46,460
Yeah.

769
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:48,900
Oh.

770
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,020
Okay, it's time.

771
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:56,300
Left.

772
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:00,740
Oh, God.

773
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:01,180
It's centered.

774
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:01,820
It's centered.

775
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,260
I think I can risk this one.

776
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:07,720
Oh, that's so risky.

777
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:09,740
Oh, that is so...

778
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:10,160
Oh.

779
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,260
Oh, my God.

780
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:17,860
Okay, I got to eat.

781
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:18,360
I got to eat.

782
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,040
I got to eat.

783
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,120
I'm going to eat lasagna.

784
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:22,840
I have to eat one.

785
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:24,220
That was...

786
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,840
fucking risky of me to do.

787
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:32,160
But I was like praying the fact that it's not Sans with a,
it's not Garfield with a gun.

788
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:37,680
Okay, that's bullshit!

789
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,960
Okay, that one was bullshit.

790
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:45,600
I gotta eat the spaghetti.

791
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,780
I couldn't make it at the time.

792
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,480
It was not wanted to.

793
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:54,760
Oh, thank God.

794
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:55,460
Freebie, Tad.

795
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:01,490
All right.

796
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:03,270
At least I got the freebie.

797
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:06,290
They felt bad for me.

798
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:09,810
I feel bad for me, too.

799
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:16,280
Oh, my God.

800
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:17,940
Oh, my.

801
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:18,940
I didn't see the bottom left.

802
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:19,680
I didn't see it.

803
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:21,960
Okay.

804
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:23,960
Not Sand's with a...

805
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,360
Not Garfield with a gun.

806
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,180
Not Garfield.

807
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:31,900
Oh.

808
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:32,700
Oh.

809
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,160
I said...

810
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,680
I risked it all.

811
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:48,120
I didn't think that he would give me Garfield with my gun.

812
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:50,560
I risked it all.

813
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:55,080
I was like, there's no way.

814
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:57,320
There's no way he's gonna come in with a Glock.

815
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,800
There's no way.

816
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,480
Oh, I'm not doing okay right now.

817
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,760
I swear to God, he might as well be aimbotting.

818
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,100
He might as well.

819
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:19,820
Oh, is it in order?

820
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,540
It triggers at half health.

821
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:28,860
Okay, that's good to know.

822
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:31,540
Now I know he'll always come back.

823
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:33,720
Okay, fuck you, Odie.

824
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:35,340
You know, I'll risk it.

825
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:38,720
Risk, baby.

826
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,480
I take that Gamba.

827
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,480
Gamba time.

828
00:55:56,990 --> 00:56:00,910
Okay, now I take the lasagna time.

829
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:06,830
Alright, there you go.

830
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:11,210
Oh my god, fucking course.

831
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:14,870
Are you fucking?

832
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:16,070
Okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

833
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:17,050
It's okay.

834
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:17,130
It's okay.

835
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:18,330
It's just one damage.

836
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:21,070
It's practically nothing for you, Doki.

837
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:22,950
Look how healthy you are.

838
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:25,470
Barely a spruce.

839
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:27,530
Not even a bruise.

840
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:37,010
All right.

841
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:39,470
One more hit.

842
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:41,850
Oh, God.

843
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:43,210
Okay, that was on me.

844
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:45,690
Oh, ha ha ha ha.

845
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:48,750
No, I got a spaghetti that.

846
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:50,250
That was on me.

847
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:52,150
That was poor positioning.

848
00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:55,530
His butt of scratch.

849
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:04,250
All right.

850
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:05,470
Now that I will trigger it.

851
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:08,750
Snappy wappy time

852
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:14,790
Okay, at least it gave me a cheat first

853
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:21,830
Pray What's that?

854
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:23,970
What the fuck?

855
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:25,090
Oh

856
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:30,950
Okay, that...

857
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:33,650
Oh, yeah, a fucking...

858
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:34,590
Okay, cool.

859
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:37,270
Oh my god, that threw me off.

860
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:39,590
Oh my god, that blast threw me off.

861
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:41,710
I was like, what the fuck?

862
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:44,550
It didn't even matter!

863
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:47,790
He can't die here face still!

864
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:51,090
What do you mean that with some fucking move?

865
00:57:56,190 --> 00:57:57,530
Okay, pray tab.

866
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:00,790
My toes tingle?

867
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:02,890
Oh, okay, that's...

868
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:04,850
Okay, all right, thank you.

869
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:06,530
Thank you.

870
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:12,290
Oh, God.

871
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:14,310
I'm a lot of spaghetti.

872
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:17,650
Thanks, Gabe.

873
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:18,530
Thanks.

Good to know that stuff.

00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:21,330
Blood circulating in my toes.

01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,000
Oh my god, I got hit by the pipe.

902
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:09,960
I didn't think it was possible.

903
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:16,810
It's okay.

904
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:18,250
It's just half HP.

905
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:20,850
Just half HP.

906
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:29,200
Oh god.

907
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:33,140
29.

908
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:41,900
Woo!

909
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,920
Oh, just 50 HP things.

910
01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:50,190
Jumpy jump.

911
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,260
And then Odie.

912
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:56,680
Okay.

913
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:58,940
I'll do a hit here.

914
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:00,600
And then...

915
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:01,560
Oh, nice.

916
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:02,700
And I'll eat pasta.

917
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,400
No, actually, I'll pray.

918
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:07,960
I'm going to pray.

919
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:09,520
Because there's a chance.

920
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:10,120
Oh, God.

921
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:11,580
Okay, wait, I need to focus this.

922
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:14,280

A 50-miss guy.

977
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:44,940
She had an emergency, and that's why she wasn't taking my
cars.

995
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:28,000
You can't tell me if a cat fucking runs up to you with a
gun, you would not get shot.

Come on.

997

Okay, guys, guys, I'm not doing a shift again.

Okay, guys, the shift was a mistake.

1019
01:11:59,530 --> 01:12:01,570
The shift was absolutely a mistake.

1020
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:03,630
I am not doing holding shift again.

1021
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:04,690
I...

1022
01:12:08,150 --> 01:12:10,430
The shift might have been...

1023
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:12,790
Might have been a mistake to do.

1024
01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:19,070
Guys, please do not throw rocks at Garfield.

1025
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:35,220
I should have been more specific, but also please don't
punch Garfield too.

1026
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:38,160
That was my bad.

1027
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,640
I wasn't specific.

1028
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:42,600
We didn't throw a rock, though.

1029
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,180
Not a rock.

1030
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:46,200
That is true.

1031
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:47,780
Not a rock.

1032
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:57,280
You did throw rock paper...

1033
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:57,780
Rock...

1034
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:59,520
Rock, paper, scissors, though.

1035
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:00,980
Pass the fairy!

1036
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:03,800
Yay!

1037
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:06,120
She gave me noodles.

1038
01:13:11,910 --> 01:13:12,190
Oh, nope.

1039
01:13:12,350 --> 01:13:12,670
I can't.

1040
01:13:12,830 --> 01:13:13,210
I shouldn't complain.

1041
01:13:13,770 --> 01:13:15,010
I'll hit food is food.

1042
01:13:15,230 --> 01:13:17,310
There's people starving in Africa, Tokyo.

1043
01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:18,990
Food is food.

1044
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:19,650
You're right.

1045
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:21,190
Food is food.

1046
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:23,110
Oh, yay.

1047
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:23,990
Noodles.

1048
01:13:24,810 --> 01:13:25,230
Yeah.

1049
01:13:29,630 --> 01:13:30,410
You're right.

1050
01:13:30,530 --> 01:13:31,230
People are starving.

1051
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:33,910
driving in Africa and I've got food.

1052
01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:38,390
Pasta fairy is on a budget.

1053
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:42,250
Can't keep feeding me, I guess.

1054
01:13:42,670 --> 01:13:44,110
It's not a soup kitchen.

1055
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:55,980
Oh, okay.

1056
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:57,920
Maybe I'll pray one more time.

1057
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:03,480
Maybe.

1058
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:05,300
Maybe.

1059
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:07,280
Maybe, Pastor fairy.

1060
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:08,400
Look, I don't...

1061
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,540
Oh, thanks, guys.

1062
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:12,300
Thanks.

1063
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:22,410
I forgot the script.

1064
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,300
No problem.

1065
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:31,380
Welcome back.

1066
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:37,740
Where is my butt?

1067
01:14:49,130 --> 01:14:52,290
Just a little A that touched me.

1068
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:54,610
Alright.

1069
01:14:57,450 --> 01:14:58,390
Pookie time?

1070
01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:01,910
Okay, it's Pookie, it's still Pookie time?

1071
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:03,230
Oh my god!

1072
01:15:03,870 --> 01:15:04,770
Pookie, please!

1073
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:13,620
Oh, it's okay, it's okay.

1074
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:14,860
It's a little...

1075
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:16,420
Well, Pookie doesn't hurt anybody.

1076
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:19,400
Well, it hurts me, but like, you know, it doesn't...

1077
01:15:24,830 --> 01:15:25,690

01:34:10,890 --> 01:34:14,870

Where am I sent to?

1298
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:20,970

Abbey Dubai.

1327

01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:07,240
Too bad noinkins get what they deserve.

I ain't losing to a degenerate like you.

1340
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:36,920
This is unearned.

1341
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:42,400
But now I got you right where I want you.

1342
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:45,820
Your palace, I've seen through your every move.

1343
01:37:47,220 --> 01:37:48,500
With this Iron Man.

1344
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:52,080
I'll grant you a little bit of mercy.

1345
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:56,640
You can save being a cutest forever.

1346

I ain't so bad.

1350
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:10,260
I mean, doing it in a plushie ain't so bad.

1351
01:38:14,230 --> 01:38:16,750
I like this catcrafted with hay.

1352
01:38:17,070 --> 01:38:19,310
And we have a three-year warranty, guys!

1353
01:38:19,770 --> 01:38:20,570
Look at that!

1354
01:38:22,250 --> 01:38:24,270
Guys, look, three-year warranty.

1355
01:38:24,650 --> 01:38:26,210
You barely get that for other stuff.

1356
01:38:27,090 --> 01:38:28,230
You gotta pay for that.

1357
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:38,650
Yes.

1358
01:38:39,730 --> 01:38:41,050
This is like stolen valor.

1359
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:46,160
That's it.

1360
01:38:46,820 --> 01:38:48,260
Doki, this is stolen valor.

1361
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:49,160
What are you doing?

1362
01:38:52,820 --> 01:38:54,320
No, this is crazy.

1363
01:38:54,460 --> 01:38:57,540
The Monday difficulty, the one out of one?

1364
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,320
Okay, I gotta see this.

1365
01:39:00,980 --> 01:39:01,960
Oh, wait, what?

1366
01:39:02,580 --> 01:39:05,800
You mean I could just stay there the entire time?

1367
01:39:11,270 --> 01:39:12,310
Holy shit.

1368
01:39:13,290 --> 01:39:14,830
Okay, that's crazy.

1369
01:39:15,970 --> 01:39:16,870
The 1 HP.

1370
01:39:20,710 --> 01:39:22,290
Whoa, what the fuck?

1371
01:39:22,750 --> 01:39:23,850
How is he doing this?

1372
01:39:24,410 --> 01:39:24,610
How?

1373
01:39:24,970 --> 01:39:29,050
I swear to God, Sandsfield was not this easy when I played
it.

1374
01:39:31,270 --> 01:39:33,430
Yeah, this is actually a hitless run.

1375
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:45,900
I swear to god he hacked the game somehow to make the game
easier for him I swear to god there's no way

1376
01:39:49,460 --> 01:39:58,940
There's no way he he edited in code Obviously he downloaded
a different version

1377
01:40:10,850 --> 01:40:18,030
I'm like so impressed with like not getting hit on the pipe
though That's the ZZZ one.

1378
01:40:18,550 --> 01:40:19,410
Without getting hit.

1379
01:40:20,270 --> 01:40:21,430
That one's gonna be interesting.

1380
01:40:25,380 --> 01:40:26,880
Yeah, you can always pass through the cheese.

1381
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:28,540
And, uh...

1382
01:40:28,540 --> 01:40:29,560
Oh, that's smart.

1383
01:40:29,740 --> 01:40:31,740
Because he knows exactly when he needs to sleep.

1384
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:33,060
There you go.

1385
01:40:33,620 --> 01:40:35,060
What the fuck did he do?

1386
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:37,080
What the fuck?

1387
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:39,900
What the fuck?

1388
01:40:40,220 --> 01:40:40,560
What?

1389
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:46,200
Why is he not...

1390
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:46,460
Oh, wait.

1391
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:47,280
There's no point in praying.

1392
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,180
So he's like purposely missing.

1393
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:52,560
We did it, everyone.

1394
01:40:52,780 --> 01:40:54,100
We found the pipe.

1395
01:40:56,780 --> 01:40:58,820
That's so smooth.

1396
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:00,680
Guys, he's hacking.

1397
01:41:00,940 --> 01:41:01,820
I swear to God.

1398
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:03,200
This is a script.

1399
01:41:03,660 --> 01:41:05,600
He's using a script, guys.

1400
01:41:08,140 --> 01:41:10,600
I refuse to believe this is human.

1401
01:41:10,940 --> 01:41:11,820
Human touch.

1402
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:15,900
He set up like those like,

1403
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:30,040
um that like does stuff for your keys i forgot what it's
called like that program like you set up so that you can do

Yeah, yeah, I'm doing the hardest run right now.

1410
01:42:49,890 --> 01:42:51,470
This is me, obviously.

1411
01:42:52,350 --> 01:42:53,970
Not Stolen Valor or anything.

1412
01:42:55,230 --> 01:42:58,370
God, how could you guys think I would, like, fake a run?

1413
01:42:59,990 --> 01:43:00,870
Not Markiplier.

1414
01:43:01,310 --> 01:43:01,970
In FNAF.

1415
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:06,920
Obviously.

1416
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:11,880
I'm not Dream.

1417
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:14,900
Oh, look at this, guys.

1418
01:43:15,020 --> 01:43:16,920
I finally figured out how to do this mode.

1419
01:43:18,580 --> 01:43:19,380
Under.

1420
01:43:27,420 --> 01:43:28,900
Look at that.

1421
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:39,720
Yeah, Doki would never.

1422
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:40,500
Exactly.

1423
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:41,480
I'm Doki.

1424
01:43:44,660 --> 01:43:47,320
He stares into the camera.

1425
01:43:51,120 --> 01:43:51,920
Hmm.

1426
01:44:09,580 --> 01:44:10,240
Alright.

1434
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:24,140
No hit run.

1435
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:25,000
Wow.

1436
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:26,680
I mean, of course I do it.

1437
01:44:26,940 --> 01:44:27,220
I'm high.

1438
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:28,040
I'm a gamer.

1439
01:44:29,740 --> 01:44:30,660
Sairs into the camera.

1440
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:35,280
I did it, guys.

1441
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:42,320
Oh, now both resizer activate.

1442
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:43,040
Please.

1443
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:46,420
You're 100 years too early to be facing me.

1444
01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:49,380
What's the matter?

1445
01:44:49,820 --> 01:44:50,400
I'm giving up.

1446
01:44:57,080 --> 01:44:59,380
Have you been working out?

1447
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:01,900
Whoa, you're so slow, bro.

1448
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:04,640
I'm gay, but, bro, you're so slow.

1449
01:45:05,780 --> 01:45:07,420
Give me a break, yeah!

1450
01:45:13,460 --> 01:45:15,600
This really is the end, eh?

1451
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:18,720
I've got to add it to you, Nerva.

1452
01:45:19,580 --> 01:45:22,540
You're an irredeemable monster.

1453
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:27,340
Well, I'm not too sure you're Nerval anymore.

1454
01:45:29,060 --> 01:45:31,920
Arlene, Alphalus, Pookie, Odorus.

1455
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:35,240
I couldn't avenge any of you.

1456
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:38,900
He's become Monday.

1457
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:41,620
Nerval is now.

1458
01:45:58,550 --> 01:45:59,310
Evil.

1459
01:46:08,050 --> 01:46:09,330
Oh my god, wait a second.

1460
01:46:09,350 --> 01:46:11,350
Statues crossed out, too!

1461
01:46:12,150 --> 01:46:17,810
I don't know if you guys see this, but Satisfil's statue
also, like, got chopped up.

1462
01:46:19,150 --> 01:46:20,030
Man, you think of Super Chat?

1463
01:46:20,090 --> 01:46:20,890
Thank you, thank you.

1464
01:46:20,930 --> 01:46:23,130
Don't keep watching every sequence in the no-hit run.

1465
01:46:23,230 --> 01:46:23,990
Yeah, that's what I would do.

1466
01:46:24,090 --> 01:46:25,050
Yeah, I know, right?

1467
01:46:25,230 --> 01:46:29,830
It's like how, like, when people watch, like, sports or
esports, like, yeah, I would have done something.

1468
01:46:30,070 --> 01:46:30,990
I wouldn't have done that.

1469
01:46:31,170 --> 01:46:33,110
Or, like, yeah, I would have done that differently, you
know?

1470
01:46:34,390 --> 01:46:35,610
Yeah, I could do that, too.

1471
01:46:36,930 --> 01:46:37,290
Yeah, I could do that, too.

1472
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:40,730
Oh my god!

1473
01:46:41,470 --> 01:46:42,270
Or maybe not.

1474
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:44,070
It looks like your rat is here.

1475
01:46:45,010 --> 01:46:45,990
Prepare for a liftoff.

1476
01:46:48,950 --> 01:46:51,510
You're going to orbit, you stupid schmuck.

1477
01:46:58,830 --> 01:47:01,150
You'll have fun in other space.

1478
01:47:01,970 --> 01:47:04,610
It's cold and empty, just like you.

1479
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:14,560
Okay, the kill option is definitely better than Mercy.

1480
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:15,680
Nirm...

1481
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:18,220
Because at least, like, Nirm will be...

1482
01:47:18,220 --> 01:47:19,700
Like, still lives.

1483
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:22,820
Nirmal drifted endlessly through the space.

1484
01:47:23,660 --> 01:47:24,740
He's going through that more.

1485
01:47:25,020 --> 01:47:25,520
Oh, never mind.

1486
01:47:25,700 --> 01:47:26,640
He's drifting endlessly.

1487
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:31,160
Because at least Nirmal can still be alive, even though he
kills everyone.

1488
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:34,800
Eventually, Nirmal stopped thinking.

1489
01:47:45,460 --> 01:47:47,320
Yeah, that's why you never spare.

1490
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:47,780
Don't worry.

1491
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:50,740
There's still one more ending left that I got.

1492
01:47:51,660 --> 01:47:52,140
Naturally.

1493
01:48:09,620 --> 01:48:10,100
Where?

1494
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:10,560
Oh.

1495
01:48:13,940 --> 01:48:14,500
Whoa.

1496
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:17,480
What happened?

1497
01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:25,850
Where's the extra?

1498
01:48:28,610 --> 01:48:30,010
Oh, it's just credits.

1499
01:48:31,510 --> 01:48:32,750
Wait, that's not the ending.

1500
01:48:33,410 --> 01:48:33,570
Where?

1501
01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:37,530
Oh, we're just looking at the credits.

1502
01:48:37,750 --> 01:48:39,570
Oh, oh, he's on Twitter now.

1503
01:48:41,250 --> 01:48:41,810
Okay.

1504
01:48:42,190 --> 01:48:43,830
So that's not all the endings.

1505
01:48:43,990 --> 01:48:44,770
All right, let's find me.

1506
01:48:45,270 --> 01:48:45,590
Okay.

1507
01:48:45,930 --> 01:48:46,630
Oh, what's the end?

1508
01:48:46,650 --> 01:48:47,670
the secret ending?

1509
01:48:48,650 --> 01:48:49,530
Secret ending.

1510
01:48:51,370 --> 01:48:52,550
That's the ending.

1511
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:01,440
Where's the...

1512
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:02,160
Oh, there it goes.

1513
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:02,880
Secret ending.

1514
01:49:03,140 --> 01:49:03,540
There we go.

1515
01:49:07,400 --> 01:49:08,840
Wait, is that the secret ending?

1516
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:10,820
Where the fuck?

1517
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:13,320
Where is that?

1518
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:14,920
Where?

1519
01:49:17,660 --> 01:49:18,960
Wait, oh, it's here.

1520
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:21,760
Oh, there you go.

1521
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:22,740
I got it.

1522
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:29,320
I have to tab out.

1523
01:49:29,500 --> 01:49:32,140
I have to, like, find it before I tab back in.

1524
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:33,380
Alright, there you go.

1525
01:49:41,560 --> 01:49:44,100
But Nervo never stopped thinking.

1526
01:49:49,950 --> 01:49:51,530
Years began to pass.

1527
01:49:52,490 --> 01:49:53,090
Decades.

1528
01:49:53,910 --> 01:49:54,510
Centuries.

1529
01:49:56,770 --> 01:49:57,790
Oh, no.

1530
01:49:57,910 --> 01:49:58,950
He's going crazy.

1531
01:49:59,710 --> 01:50:02,010
But Nervo Nermal was still thinking...

1532
01:50:02,010 --> 01:50:04,390
Oh, Noki's cuckoo bananas!

1533
01:50:06,030 --> 01:50:07,910
What the fuck?

1534
01:50:11,430 --> 01:50:12,390
Uh...

1535
01:50:12,390 --> 01:50:12,830
Nermal?

1536
01:50:16,470 --> 01:50:19,210
Wait, this is not Jojo.

1537
01:50:20,930 --> 01:50:23,250
Nermal's body solidified in stone.

1538
01:50:23,930 --> 01:50:26,610
Space debris gathered and hardened.

1539
01:50:28,970 --> 01:50:30,410
You are still there.

1540
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:37,140
Me?

1541
01:50:45,490 --> 01:50:47,350
What's going on?

1542
01:50:55,240 --> 01:50:57,260
Eon's path, space and time were meaningless.

1543
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:59,540
Existence stretch onwards to infinity.

1544
01:51:01,700 --> 01:51:03,100
Is that a Jojo reference?

1545
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:04,820
Yo, thank you for the super chat.

1546
01:51:05,020 --> 01:51:05,580
Thank you.

1547
01:51:05,580 --> 01:51:05,920
Thank you.

1548
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:12,000
But there was a bright blue marble directly in your path.

1549
01:51:12,340 --> 01:51:13,760
You could hardly believe it.

1550
01:51:17,770 --> 01:51:18,210
Perfect.

1551
01:51:24,140 --> 01:51:25,730
What is he going to do?

1552
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:27,980
Don't do it, Durba!

1553
01:51:30,060 --> 01:51:30,800
No!

1554
01:51:34,550 --> 01:51:37,190
He's gonna kill the dinosaurs!

1555
01:51:40,710 --> 01:51:42,190
The end.

1556
01:51:43,430 --> 01:51:44,490
Oh my god, he did it.

1557
01:51:44,710 --> 01:51:45,750
That wild man.

1558
01:51:46,710 --> 01:51:47,130
Bravo.

1559
01:51:47,890 --> 01:51:49,670
Well played, my little friend.

1560
01:51:50,190 --> 01:51:51,630
Bro, killed the dinosaurs.

1561
01:51:57,910 --> 01:52:03,760
The way you manipulate manipulate that Zansfield character
in the sending you in a space.

1562
01:52:07,930 --> 01:52:09,130
Jim Davis!

1563
01:52:09,690 --> 01:52:10,670
Little did he know.

1564
01:52:11,070 --> 01:52:14,010
He was perpetuating your existence for all eternity.

1565
01:52:14,810 --> 01:52:17,210
Dastardly, I'm a big fan.

1566
01:52:17,650 --> 01:52:22,110
Please continue to entertain me with your hilarious antics
and I'll be watched.

1567
01:52:22,170 --> 01:52:22,910
I knew it!

1568
01:52:23,070 --> 01:52:25,170
I knew Nirmal was his favorite character.

1569
01:52:25,570 --> 01:52:27,770
Why else would he torture us with his presence?

1570
01:52:28,490 --> 01:52:29,450
Oh my god.

1571
01:52:30,930 --> 01:52:31,910
Mr. Davis.

1572
01:52:35,010 --> 01:52:36,330
Yes, JD Gaster.

1573
01:52:41,480 --> 01:52:42,580
Oh, spooky.

1574
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:45,680
Oh, my God.

1575
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:47,520
How long is that today for you?

1576
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:53,000
You became the very thing you swore to destroy.

1577
01:52:54,100 --> 01:52:56,860
You became Monday.

1578
01:52:57,800 --> 01:53:00,080
How could you, Tokey?

1579
01:53:03,540 --> 01:53:21,860

1581
01:53:34,180 --> 01:53:36,680
have to create Monday still.

1582
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:40,460
It was me, Godfield.

1583
01:53:41,060 --> 01:53:42,580
I did it all.

1584
01:53:44,200 --> 01:53:45,300
Melan's in the Super Chat.

1585
01:53:45,420 --> 01:53:45,700
Thank you.

1586
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:46,600
Thank you.

1587
01:53:46,640 --> 01:53:47,520
What a way.

1588
01:53:47,940 --> 01:53:49,840
And then let's go back to the kitchen.

1589
01:53:50,180 --> 01:53:52,260
Hey, oh, where did my body go?

1590
01:53:52,340 --> 01:53:53,080
Okay, give me a second.

1591
01:53:53,200 --> 01:53:54,620
Don't worry, I can fix my body.

1592
01:53:57,460 --> 01:53:58,720
Give me a second.

1593
01:53:59,120 --> 01:54:01,860
Gotta fix my body real quick, guys.

1594
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:03,520
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

1595
01:54:05,180 --> 01:54:06,820
Alright, that should be it.

1596
01:54:07,740 --> 01:54:08,660
I think that fixes it.

1597
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:09,900
Yeah, there we go.

1598
01:54:10,200 --> 01:54:11,400
Now it looks less scary.

1599
01:54:15,580 --> 01:54:16,480
It's okay.

1600
01:54:16,740 --> 01:54:17,820
My body is fixed.

1601
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:18,900
It's okay.

1602
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:23,300
And now we'll have Halloween music played because I don't
want to find music right now.

1603
01:54:23,700 --> 01:54:25,980
So it's spooky Halloween BGM tab.

1604
01:54:27,220 --> 01:54:27,840
That's fun.

1605
01:54:28,700 --> 01:54:31,560
Honestly, I'm glad it did not take longer.

1606
01:54:32,040 --> 01:54:33,460
I'm really glad.

1607
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:41,840
I'm glad that um because I'm pretty sure the version because
we played the older version so I'm pretty sure the version

1608
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:53,480
we played in the end we threw one final rock that's true we
did in the end we we did end it with a rock in the end um

1609
01:54:53,480 --> 01:55:04,980
that's right I brought Mondays I'm very I think it's because
like the game because like the game we played on Halloween

1610
01:55:04,980 --> 01:55:13,920
was I think was the first version that Lumpy uploaded it so

pretty sure that's why he added like the the pasta fairy

because like thank fucking God thank God he added the pasta
airy i'm so happy we played the nerf version of this it's

1613
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:40,260

1614
01:55:40,260 --> 01:55:53,760
nice thank you lumpy for being a merciful god uh i had a
great time thank god it didn't take a long i think i didn't

1617
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:25,760
still wearing it i didn't take off his garfield outfit
because i want i i want to feel like my oh she is real so

1618
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:35,820
he's still wearing it right now um i also i also bought him
a christmas sweater too i bought him a snoopy christmas

1619
01:56:35,820 --> 01:56:41,220
sweater as well so that's really cute i got him a ton of
toys you know i just wanted to get him an early christmas

1620
01:56:41,220 --> 01:56:50,100
present because like um i needed to buy like um um i wanted
to try out some new dog foods because like i didn't want to

1621
01:56:50,100 --> 01:56:55,740
buy the expensive ass fucking kidney care food anymore
because he's cured now technically.

1622
01:56:56,060 --> 01:56:56,360
I don't know.

1623
01:56:56,500 --> 01:56:57,820
They were like, technically he's...

1624
01:56:57,820 --> 01:57:00,960
They were like he's cured, even though they told me it was a
lifelong disease.

1625
01:57:01,120 --> 01:57:01,860
And then, like, I don't know.

1626
01:57:01,940 --> 01:57:05,660
I guess dad didn't realize it was a lifelong disease.

1627
01:57:05,820 --> 01:57:07,580
So then he cured himself for some shit.

1628
01:57:07,880 --> 01:57:10,120
So then I was like, all right, I'm gonna find, like, cheaper
food.

1629
01:57:10,240 --> 01:57:17,720
Because, like, now that I don't have to get prescription dog
food anymore, I'm gonna look for, like, try and see...

1630
01:57:17,720 --> 01:57:18,680
Yeah, he just tanked it.

1631
01:57:21,560 --> 01:57:23,640
So I went to the...

1632
01:57:23,660 --> 01:57:31,280
to the pet store to see if i can find like um like see what
kind of dog food i can get that's cheaper but also like is

1633
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:37,720
like i also i still got wet dog food i just wanted like
something cheaper because they were very very expensive um

1634
01:57:37,720 --> 01:57:44,660
every week so i mean i did end up spending like 200 in the
end because i bought him a goddamn fucking sofa and um lots

1635
01:57:44,660 --> 01:57:50,440
of toys and also like lots of clothes and everything but you
know it's you know it's a little christmas gift for him i'm

1636
01:57:50,440 --> 01:58:01,100
tempted to throne account but i'm tempted to like like make
it keep it like dad only so if anyone wants to send um dad

1637
01:58:01,100 --> 01:58:07,520
any toys or anything like you guys can send him stuff um
because he's always destroying toys uh because he's a little

1638
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:15,740
so i'll think about it because i know some of you guys like
sending dad like stuff like outfits and toys and stuff so

1639
01:58:15,740 --> 01:58:24,000
maybe i'll think about it um i mean it'd be like you know
it'd be cute you know i can show you guys photos of like

1640
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:30,020
what you guys send over but i'll think about it i'll think
about it uh just make it just primarily dad like not for me

1641
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:47,080
can we send dad a rice cooker no because he will not be
eating rice guys he's not gonna need a rice cooker guys um

1642
01:58:47,080 --> 01:58:51,880
um but yeah no i bought him like a bunch of toys.

1643
01:58:52,260 --> 01:58:55,860
I bought, oh my god, I like let him roam around the pet
store.

1644
01:58:56,280 --> 01:59:03,700
And then he kept trying, he kept finding balls like, like
that sneaked underneath like underneath the, what's it

1645
01:59:03,700 --> 01:59:04,460
called, the shelves.

1646
01:59:04,820 --> 01:59:08,920
Like I don't know how every time I was like, no, it's very,
it's so dirty.

1647
01:59:09,020 --> 01:59:12,400
Like he kept like going under the shelves and like finding a
new ball.

1648
01:59:12,460 --> 01:59:17,200
He found like four fucking balls that rolled under the shelf
and he like brought them to me.

1649
01:59:17,260 --> 01:59:26,120
I'm like, not buying this ball it's fucking disgusting and
he just he gets just like okay but i found another one

1650
01:59:26,120 --> 01:59:37,240
though yeah he's like a fucking ball detector i bought him a
ball and i went and bought him a ball like a clean one um uh

1651
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:43,280

Um, um, and, you know, I'm glad I was able to, uh, grab
Moxie and Wig on my team.

1678
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:39,120
Um, I was like, are you down?

1681
02:02:42,040 --> 02:02:45,740
Uh, Moxie and Wig never interacted together before, but
They're both really funny people.

1682
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:50,700
So Moxie and Wig were like, yeah, like Moxie's like, oh
yeah, Wig's fucking hilarious.

1683
02:02:51,020 --> 02:02:52,920
So I'd love to talk to him.

1684
02:02:53,060 --> 02:02:55,340
And Wig was like, yeah, he seems like a really funny guy.

1685
02:02:55,440 --> 02:02:58,340
So they both think they're, they both think they're, a lot.

1686
02:02:58,480 --> 02:03:00,060
English is hard if it's my first language.

1687
02:03:00,540 --> 02:03:02,960
They both think that the other person is funny.

1688
02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:04,900
So like, I hope we all have fun.

1689
02:03:06,120 --> 02:03:09,380
Moxie and I have not played Apex in a very fucking long
time.

1690
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:14,360
I did play like two games of Apex a couple of days ago.

1691
02:03:14,380 --> 02:03:24,660
go um and i was like and then i won two games i won both the
games i played as alter bro alter is fucking pussy is such a

1692
02:03:24,660 --> 02:03:34,480
pussy fucking hero and i love it because i was playing alter
i was just like die on point i have res because like okay so

1693
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:43,840
alter um up there was like basically her up she throws like
her alt thing down and you just send your two teammates out

1694
02:03:43,840 --> 02:03:50,460
into like out to die you literally wait at your like little
portal you wait at your portal and then you it's like

1695
02:03:50,460 --> 02:03:56,400
pokemon you send your two teammates out to die and the
moment they get knocked down you just freaking like bring

1696
02:03:56,400 --> 02:04:05,720
them back to the portal and then just res them and then like
i did that like seven times and it's unlimited too that's a

1697
02:04:05,720 --> 02:04:09,240
crazy part that you can do it Like, a non-stop.

1698
02:04:09,400 --> 02:04:11,320
I was like, bro, this is so dumb.

1699
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:14,940
It's so fucking dumb.

1700
02:04:16,440 --> 02:04:19,280
So, and then, like, I was like, okay, I think I'm...

1701
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:20,080
I'm think...

1702
02:04:20,080 --> 02:04:22,800
And I played two games, and I was like, yeah, I think I got
it.

1703
02:04:22,860 --> 02:04:24,080
And I went back to Rivalrous.

1704
02:04:26,080 --> 02:04:28,140
I definitely was not practicing.

1705
02:04:28,600 --> 02:04:30,080
I mean, I technically...

1706
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:31,080
I did practice, guys.

1707
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:33,080
I technically did practice.

1708
02:04:33,260 --> 02:04:34,960
I was just like, okay, I think I get it.

1709
02:04:35,020 --> 02:04:36,780
And then I went and booted up Marvel Rivalrous.

1710
02:04:43,060 --> 02:04:44,340
I don't know.

1711
02:04:45,740 --> 02:04:47,560
I think they made the game too easy.

1712
02:04:48,340 --> 02:04:49,240
That's the only thing.

1713
02:04:49,360 --> 02:04:52,080
I think that's why I couldn't, I didn't, like, play longer.

1714
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:55,780
Because I think they made the game way too easy now.

1715
02:04:55,980 --> 02:05:01,060
It's definitely very, I didn't realize how casual coded the
game is now for Apex.

1716
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:05,300
Because, like, they have a tutorial on how to Mantle Boost.

1717
02:05:05,400 --> 02:05:11,340
For those who don't know what Mantle Boost is, was really
really hard to mantle boost and you have to like time it

1718
02:05:11,340 --> 02:05:17,960
correctly and everything i logged in i logged in the apex
and they're like would you like to have the mantle boost ui

1719
02:05:17,960 --> 02:05:24,820
on your screen and i was like what the fuck what i was just
so because by the way i haven't played apex like the actual

1720
02:05:24,820 --> 02:05:35,840
apex apex in like more than almost a year i think i think i
think so and i like i was like oh my god there's like a

1721
02:05:35,840 --> 02:05:41,920
little tutorial on your screen like every time you like
every time you climb something up the you there's a ui

1722
02:05:41,920 --> 02:05:48,060
that's like remember the press space now if you want a
mantle boost i'm like it's so weird i have it on because of

1723
02:05:48,060 --> 02:05:54,240
course i'll i'll take advantage of that i was never
consistent in mantle boosting so i was like oh yeah fuck

1724
02:05:54,240 --> 02:06:11,480
yeah let me yeah i'm it's I'm baby I was like fuck yeah I'm
baby I need I need a step-by-step tutorial game I like yeah

1725
02:06:11,480 --> 02:06:18,840
I need those training wheels let me in fact let me give me
four training wheels this is not a tricycle anymore I need

1726
02:06:18,840 --> 02:06:21,160
like four of them it's just a car now.

1727
02:06:22,360 --> 02:06:24,000
I fucking, I made a car.

1728
02:06:29,300 --> 02:06:33,640
So, Moxie also hasn't played Apex in a year as well.

1729
02:06:33,940 --> 02:06:35,040
So, good luck, nice wig.

1730
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:36,120
You're the IGL.

1731
02:06:36,640 --> 02:06:38,380
Our team name is washed GGs.

1732
02:06:39,940 --> 02:06:41,300
Yeah, I came up with that team.

1733
02:06:41,360 --> 02:06:43,720
I love coming up with team names, but that's my team name.

1734
02:06:44,140 --> 02:06:45,180
Washed GGs.

1735
02:06:45,520 --> 02:06:48,900
Because I know like, you know, whenever we die, you guys can
be like washed GGs.

1736
02:06:55,520 --> 02:07:07,840
It's fitting The name of chance Yeah, yeah Whenever we die
You guys can be like Watched GGs Yeah, I'm very aware I'm

1737
02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:18,020
not Very aware Bro, oh my god So The tournament It was
supposed It's like It's supposed to be like So like there's

1738
02:07:18,020 --> 02:07:26,400
three tiers So it's like good at Apex or in like casual
slash noob.

1739
02:07:26,940 --> 02:07:29,660
And I was just like, I looked at it and I was on the middle.

1740
02:07:30,300 --> 02:07:37,000
And I was like, and but then I saw people in the third
category that was like that plays Apex a lot still or like,

1741
02:07:37,700 --> 02:07:40,000
um, and or like has hit masters and stuff.

1742
02:07:40,200 --> 02:07:42,800
And I was like, why am I not in the third category?

1743
02:07:43,160 --> 02:07:47,300
Like, because I was like, I haven't touched Apex in a year.

1744
02:07:49,960 --> 02:07:56,180
be in the third category and then and then it was very hard
i understand because it was very hard it must be very hard

1745
02:07:56,180 --> 02:08:04,020
to balance and they were like well um you still hit like you
do like hit top 500 in rivals and i'm like but like that's

1746
02:08:04,020 --> 02:08:11,020
third person though i was just like but i was like i have
been in a couple also i have in a couple of seasons either

1747
02:08:11,020 --> 02:08:17,840
but like they're just there i mean it makes sense because
they said their justification was that um i'm able to take

1748
02:08:17,840 --> 02:08:23,800
instructions very well and I have good game sense, which is
like, you know, it's understandable because like I have good

1749
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:30,220
game sense and so, and I can still like semi IGL.

1750
02:08:30,460 --> 02:08:36,860
So that's why they put me in the middle, but I was just
like, but then like, they're also like, oh, um, in the third

1751
02:08:36,860 --> 02:08:42,300
category, like I was just like, wait, but some of these
players, they're still playing Apex or like, but they're

1752
02:08:42,300 --> 02:08:46,940
like, yeah, but this person didn't play for a whole season
for last season.

1753
02:08:46,940 --> 02:08:51,740
So that's why they're in the third category this they
haven't played a lot and I'm like I haven't played in a year

1754
02:08:53,980 --> 02:08:57,820
Oh, they haven't played for one whole season now.

1755
02:08:57,940 --> 02:09:00,320
I'm like I haven't played in a year

1756
02:09:07,640 --> 02:09:08,860
That's a joke guys.

1757
02:09:09,360 --> 02:09:10,620
I thought it was just funny.

1758
02:09:10,920 --> 02:09:12,360
I was just like what

1759
02:09:17,300 --> 02:09:32,040
season like but yeah yeah boohoo one whole season that they
didn't play yeah I just thought that was really funny I was

1760
02:09:32,040 --> 02:09:38,720
just like what the fuck um um but I understand the
justification while in the middle category just because like

1761
02:09:38,720 --> 02:09:45,620
my experiences I guess like my experience isn't competitive
in various games I can just pick things up really fast but I

1762
02:09:45,620 --> 02:09:53,760
don't know I don't know it's very for me it's also like it's
also like there's so much pressure too on me with it because

1763
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:59,680
there's always like so much high expectation being like oh
you know just because like she's very competitive and she

1764
02:09:59,680 --> 02:10:05,780
always does like she tries so hard and stuff like that so it
always has a lot of pressure and stuff because i'm just like

1765
02:10:05,780 --> 02:10:13,200
oh why am i i thought i was like i thought i would like you
know they put me i would eventually get a lower tier

1766
02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:23,020
You know, I thought eventually I'll be put in the third
category, third tier, you know?

1767
02:10:23,160 --> 02:10:27,940
I was just like, I haven't even, bros, I haven't even
touched rank in so long.

1768
02:10:28,080 --> 02:10:32,300
Some of these people have hit masters like a couple, like
two or two seasons ago.

1769
02:10:32,640 --> 02:10:37,180
I think I've been like hard stuck bronze because I haven't
touched rank that long.

1770
02:10:37,180 --> 02:10:37,880
Oh, no, never mind.

1771
02:10:37,980 --> 02:10:39,060
There's like placements now.

1772
02:10:40,280 --> 02:10:45,460
My SBMM is gold, apparently, which is crazy because I
haven't touched rank in a year.

1773
02:10:45,640 --> 02:10:46,920
Like I haven't even touched rank in a year.

1774
02:10:46,940 --> 02:10:48,380
Since Rivals came out.

1775
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:52,400
Since Rivals came out.

1776
02:10:52,580 --> 02:10:53,800
I haven't touched rank since then.

1777
02:10:58,260 --> 02:10:58,600
Yeah.

1778
02:11:00,040 --> 02:11:01,420
So I thought that was like...

1779
02:11:02,480 --> 02:11:03,920
I don't think I'll ever...

1780
02:11:03,920 --> 02:11:07,840
I don't think I'll ever be put in a lower tier category no
matter what.

1781
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:13,000
That's a funny connection.

1782
02:11:14,580 --> 02:11:16,920
They remember the war crimes you committed.

1783
02:11:16,940 --> 02:11:18,340
in the hide-and-seek tournament.

1784
02:11:18,640 --> 02:11:19,680
Gordon, thank you for the super chat.

1785
02:11:19,900 --> 02:11:19,960
Thank you.

1786
02:11:20,060 --> 02:11:20,620
Thank you.

1787
02:11:21,120 --> 02:11:21,140
Thank you.

1788
02:11:21,320 --> 02:11:22,580

Thank you.

1791
02:11:23,420 --> 02:11:25,800
Y'all put a higher because you are in Minnesota.

1792
02:11:26,120 --> 02:11:27,720
Psychological warfare is worse than competing.

1793
02:11:27,860 --> 02:11:28,560
Thank you for the super chat.

1794
02:11:28,700 --> 02:11:28,760
Thank you.

1795
02:11:28,840 --> 02:11:29,200
Thank you.

1796
02:11:29,320 --> 02:11:32,500
And then, like, I did appreciate that.

1797
02:11:32,640 --> 02:11:34,980
They let me get Moxie as my third.

1798
02:11:37,340 --> 02:11:44,540
Because I said, like, oh, I was like, oh, I do feel a little
uncomfortable because, you know, I did.

1799
02:11:44,620 --> 02:11:50,060
I did say, like, you know, I don't have, I haven't had much
experience in the game in a very long time so i'm out of

1800
02:11:50,060 --> 02:11:55,500
meta you know i'm out of meta i don't know what's meta
anymore i mean i did hit like effect i asked effect about

1801
02:11:55,500 --> 02:12:01,000
like what the meta is and like what players to play what
characters to play um but even then i felt like you know i

1802
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:07,040
did i was like oh i did feel a little uncomfortable um as
the second tier so i was wondering if i could for the third

1803
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:14,120
tier like if i could get like moxian like he doesn't have a
lot of apex experience like he hasn't played in a year but

1804
02:12:14,120 --> 02:12:22,140
he can aim he does have really good aim so like so would
that be like okay to do you know like because like it's like

1805
02:12:22,140 --> 02:12:27,860
exchange between like he doesn't have a lot experience but
he can aim is that is that okay and they're like yeah that's

1806
02:12:27,860 --> 02:12:36,340
okay like that can we can have that since like um it would
balance everything out and everything so i'm like yay and

1807
02:12:36,340 --> 02:12:44,540
he's and i'm like you know the team has good vibes i think i
hope i hope the team will are like vibe people we're all

1808
02:12:44,540 --> 02:12:54,360
we're all like very vibey it was either moxie or tempo but i
don't think like me and wig kid um mental would be okay with

1809
02:12:54,360 --> 02:13:12,320
that again for i i like i don't know i i love i love tempo
though he's fucking fun like as the besties with all three

1810
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:22,300
of us yeah i don't want to babysit right now i love playing
with the besties though i do love playing but then like i

1811
02:13:22,300 --> 02:13:27,840
felt like the tournament had a lot of like try hearts um it
is a casual tournament it's not like a really big prize pool

1812
02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:36,240
it's more like geared towards for fun and um it's more
geared towards for fun and everything so i was like fuck it

1813
02:13:36,240 --> 02:13:43,680
i haven't played the apex in a while and i miss playing with
wig And he was down too.

1814
02:13:43,780 --> 02:13:46,300
He's literally coming back from the Red Bull tournament as
well.

1815
02:13:47,040 --> 02:13:52,020
Which was really cool because, like, I asked the organizers
if I could get Wig.

1816
02:13:52,260 --> 02:13:53,920
And they're like, oh, are you sure Wig can do it?

1817
02:13:53,940 --> 02:13:59,320
Because a lot of people who are doing the Red Bull
tournament was like, oh, no, nice Wig.

1818
02:13:59,800 --> 02:14:00,160
Nice Wig.

1819
02:14:00,340 --> 02:14:06,740
They're saying that, oh, a lot of people doing the Red Bull
tournament, they're not going to be able to come to the

1820
02:14:06,740 --> 02:14:09,220
VTuber Apex tournament.

1821
02:14:09,340 --> 02:14:10,240
Or, like, not just VTuber.

1822
02:14:12,440 --> 02:14:19,000
like slash pro tournament it's like a mix um and i asked wig
and i was like oh are you down and he's like yo fuck yeah

1823
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:22,960

1826
02:14:41,420 --> 02:14:47,220
tournament as well because he's doing this for fun as well
with me you know i assume the red bull plate paid him a lot

1827
02:14:47,220 --> 02:14:58,900
of fucking money to do the red bull tournament um because
it's fucking red bull uh yeah yeah cheers to him yeah being

think like first place is I think the first place is like I

1836
02:16:05,580 --> 02:16:11,100
think it's like a thousand but it's like you know it's
there's it's so hard like it's a thousand divided by three

um, for this, for a fun tournament.

1839
02:16:25,220 --> 02:16:28,520
Um, you need to put up an over- No, no, I'm pretty sure I
don't.

1840
02:16:28,840 --> 02:16:29,360
I'm pretty sure.

1841
02:16:29,440 --> 02:16:30,520
But, yeah, it's at 12 p.m.

1842
02:16:30,540 --> 02:16:31,440
PST, by the way.

1843
02:16:31,520 --> 02:16:32,540
I almost forgot to tell you guys.

1844
02:16:32,680 --> 02:16:35,020
Tomorrow's tournament is at 12 p.m.

1845

PST.

1846
02:16:36,480 --> 02:16:41,960
Put up the thumbnail whenever- the waiting room, whenever,
um, um, my thumbnail maker finishes it.

1847
02:16:42,620 --> 02:16:50,380
Because I forgot to give it the details until like this
morning So like I've been so tired lately that my manager

1848
02:16:50,380 --> 02:16:59,000
has been uploading my like all my waiting rooms in the last
week and a half Because I've been so tired So so cheers to

1849
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:04,880
my manager too That's why I always sometimes I forget to
turn off like rewind because of it because he makes the

1850
02:17:04,880 --> 02:17:11,400
waiting room So yeah that's why my waiting room tweets are
also like super late Because sometimes I, like, just tweet

1851
02:17:11,400 --> 02:17:12,720
it out whenever I wake up.

1852
02:17:12,900 --> 02:17:14,660
And sometimes I wake up really late.

1853
02:17:19,080 --> 02:17:19,580
So, yeah.

1854
02:17:19,780 --> 02:17:20,780
Thanks, manager.

1855
02:17:21,460 --> 02:17:21,700
Yeah.

1856
02:17:22,120 --> 02:17:25,220
But I'll see you guys tomorrow at 12 p.m.

1857
02:17:25,280 --> 02:17:25,760
PSC.

1858
02:17:25,780 --> 02:17:30,880
For those who want to watch the Apex tournament, I have no
idea how we're going to do.

1859
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:32,980
But our team is called Wash GG.

1860
02:17:33,280 --> 02:17:33,980
So we're going.

1861
02:17:34,260 --> 02:17:35,740
You're getting what you're getting.

1862
02:17:39,080 --> 02:17:40,020
You're getting.

1863
02:17:40,100 --> 02:17:42,060
You're getting what you're getting.

1864
02:17:42,620 --> 02:17:45,140
McProp's, you shout out to the organizers for that
tournament.

1865
02:17:46,620 --> 02:17:49,000
Because, you know, organizing tournaments is a lot of work.

1866
02:17:49,120 --> 02:17:51,720
There's a lot of balancing stuff they have to do and
everything.

1867
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:56,760
And they, like, put up with all my questions about, like,
balancing stuff.

1868
02:17:57,040 --> 02:18:02,060
And us also, because, like, you know, like, when I was,
like, asking, like, wait, why am I in tier two?

1869
02:18:02,340 --> 02:18:05,420
And they're, like, you know, the reason he gave me was,
like, oh, yeah, I get it.

1870
02:18:05,740 --> 02:18:09,520
I mean, I did just one, the Rivals tournament, too.

1871
02:18:10,100 --> 02:18:22,880
I'll get it like even though I'm rusty in apex I feel like
game sense you don't really lose game sense um because like

1872
02:18:22,880 --> 02:18:33,040
game sense can travel game sense like travels between like
you know between games um it's very easy to like pick up

1873
02:18:33,040 --> 02:18:40,680
very fast so I understand um I might be like my aim might
not be as good though I will have to admit I think some

1874
02:18:40,680 --> 02:18:47,980
people in tier the tier three category might have better aim
than me because i was like first person what the fuck is

1875
02:18:47,980 --> 02:19:00,400
that i was just like what the fuck is first person oh my god
everything is so close to me i swear i swear i was like

1876
02:19:00,400 --> 02:19:08,280
aiming i'm like oh my god they're like in my face is so
weird like um fps what the fuck

1877
02:19:12,380 --> 02:19:26,060
yeah why are my eyes in my head why can't I see my ass um
this is insulting I can't see my ass what's the point I this

1878
02:19:26,060 --> 02:19:40,600
is stupid yeah why no third person but my FSVTuber what
happened to her what happened to her just like my personal

1879
02:19:40,600 --> 02:19:55,340
space um um but yeah but yeah i look forward to it uh i hope
i could i'll do okay um but yeah even though i'm put on the

1880
02:19:55,340 --> 02:20:07,640
second category just letting you guys know um i think i
played apex less than um definitely not as much as i should

1881
02:20:07,640 --> 02:20:17,960
have for this tournament but we're here to have fun We have
a very fun team going in, so I'm just happy to hang out with

1882
02:20:17,960 --> 02:20:18,920

1883
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:19,400
Yep.

So I'm happy to talk to them again.

1887

It's been a while.

1888
02:20:26,680 --> 02:20:29,480
It's been a while since I've talked to Wig, and it's been a
while since I've talked to Moxie.

1889
02:20:29,740 --> 02:20:30,560
Yeah, anyway, guys.

1892
02:20:35,380 --> 02:20:38,300
I'm used to it for me at the bed, because you deserve it.

1893
02:20:38,340 --> 02:20:39,620
I'll see you guys next time, everyone.

1894
02:20:40,060 --> 02:20:40,840
Bye, guys.

1895
02:20:41,140 --> 02:20:41,540
Bye.

1896
02:21:04,660 --> 02:21:05,060
Whoa.

1897
02:21:06,300 --> 02:21:07,100
Bonus ending.

1898
02:21:07,500 --> 02:21:10,320
Because the moment I swapped, Dad started barking.

1899
02:21:10,700 --> 02:21:11,980
Let's see if I can bring him over.

1900
02:21:12,140 --> 02:21:14,620
Oh, he stopped barking because I started talking.

1901
02:21:14,700 --> 02:21:16,440
He's like, wait, I thought you ended stream.

1902
02:21:16,880 --> 02:21:18,380
Why are you like...

1903
02:21:18,380 --> 02:21:19,840
I thought you ended stream.

1904
02:21:20,160 --> 02:21:21,400
Why did...

1905
02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:22,960
Why are you talking?

1906
02:21:23,080 --> 02:21:23,580
Yeah, never mind.

1907
02:21:23,640 --> 02:21:25,200
He stopped barking.

1908
02:21:25,440 --> 02:21:26,580
Oh, do you guys hear him?

1909
02:21:27,420 --> 02:21:28,540
Do you guys hear him?

1910
02:21:31,220 --> 02:21:32,260
Do you guys hear that?

1911
02:21:32,940 --> 02:21:36,300
Yeah, he started barking the moment I went to the ending
screen.

1912
02:21:36,480 --> 02:21:37,280
Anyway, guys, bye.
